1
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,609
We're screwed.

2
00:01:31,956 --> 00:01:33,590
No more free Wi-Fi.

3
00:01:35,026 --> 00:01:36,026
Hey, Ki-jung!

4
00:01:36,127 --> 00:01:37,194
Yeah?

5
00:01:37,295 --> 00:01:41,365
The lady upstairs
put a password on 'iptime'.

6
00:01:41,466 --> 00:01:43,200
A password?

7
00:01:43,301 --> 00:01:44,934
Did you try 123456789?

8
00:01:45,078 --> 00:01:46,078
No luck.

9
00:01:46,179 --> 00:01:47,579
Do it the other way.

10
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,081
I tried that too!

11
00:01:49,182 --> 00:01:53,418
Fuck, then we can't get WhatsApp?

12
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:54,694
Nothing.

13
00:01:55,271 --> 00:01:57,489
Hey, Jim Ki-taek.

14
00:01:58,024 --> 00:02:01,493
Don't fucking pretend to sleep.
What do you think?

15
00:02:02,028 --> 00:02:08,083
Our phones are shut off.
Now our Wi-Fi is shut off.

16
00:02:08,618 --> 00:02:11,711
What's your plan?

17
00:02:13,998 --> 00:02:15,232
- Ki-woo.
- Yes, Dad?

18
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:19,260
For Wi-Fi, hold it high.

19
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,474
Stick it in every corner
and so on.

20
00:02:28,012 --> 00:02:32,065
Damn stink bugs.

21
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,793
Over here! I got it!

22
00:02:34,894 --> 00:02:36,211
Really? You got a signal?

23
00:02:36,312 --> 00:02:38,130
Yeah, see?

24
00:02:38,231 --> 00:02:40,882
This one,
'coffeeland 2G'

25
00:02:40,983 --> 00:02:42,968
Did a new cafe open?

26
00:02:43,069 --> 00:02:44,678
Why can't I get it?

27
00:02:44,779 --> 00:02:46,388
Climb up here.

28
00:02:46,489 --> 00:02:47,789
Hey kids.

29
00:02:48,189 --> 00:02:50,183
- Does it work?
- Yeah.

30
00:02:50,284 --> 00:02:52,836
Then check WhatsApp.

31
00:02:53,371 --> 00:02:55,713
Pizza Generation
said they'd contact me.

32
00:02:56,249 --> 00:02:57,632
Hold on.

33
00:02:58,167 --> 00:03:00,510
Here it is.
Pizza Generation.

34
00:03:03,548 --> 00:03:07,284
Wow!
Check this out, guys.

35
00:03:07,385 --> 00:03:10,579
If we go as fast as her,
we can finish today.

36
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,913
Then we can get paid.

37
00:03:12,014 --> 00:03:15,483
- Should we stand up too?
- She's a pro.

38
00:03:15,643 --> 00:03:18,611
What? Fumigation?

39
00:03:20,273 --> 00:03:21,757
They still do that kind of thing?

40
00:03:21,858 --> 00:03:22,799
Guess so.

41
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,675
Shut the window.

42
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:26,261
Leave it open.
We'll get free extermination.

43
00:03:26,362 --> 00:03:28,054
Kill the stink bugs.

44
00:03:28,155 --> 00:03:31,040
Right, too many
stink bugs these days...

45
00:03:33,119 --> 00:03:35,461
God, that smells!

46
00:03:37,999 --> 00:03:39,733
I told you to shut it!

47
00:03:39,834 --> 00:03:41,926
Should I shut it, Dad?

48
00:03:52,763 --> 00:03:54,564
What exactly is the problem?

49
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,418
Take this one as an example.

50
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:00,862
You call this a straight line?

51
00:04:01,397 --> 00:04:03,256
And why's it folded here?

52
00:04:03,357 --> 00:04:05,008
Why is this sticking up?

53
00:04:05,109 --> 00:04:07,702
You didn't even fold it.

54
00:04:08,738 --> 00:04:12,516
A quarter of them look like this.

55
00:04:12,617 --> 00:04:15,168
So 1 out of 4 are rejects.

56
00:04:18,331 --> 00:04:22,217
So you're really docking
10% off our pay?

57
00:04:22,543 --> 00:04:26,221
Considering the rejects
that's a low penalty, isn't it?

58
00:04:27,089 --> 00:04:30,350
Our pay is so low already!
How can you do this?

59
00:04:32,386 --> 00:04:33,386
Look here.

60
00:04:33,487 --> 00:04:36,289
This is not some minor issue.

61
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:41,444
You know what one shitty box
can do to our brand image?

62
00:04:41,854 --> 00:04:45,198
Brand? You can't even
afford a box folder!

63
00:04:45,441 --> 00:04:46,574
What did you say?

64
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:48,710
Boss.

65
00:04:49,695 --> 00:04:50,929
This is all because
of that guy, right?

66
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:51,888
What guy?

67
00:04:51,989 --> 00:04:55,851
Your part-time worker.
He's gone AWOL, right?

68
00:04:55,952 --> 00:04:59,062
Just when the Love of God Church
made a huge group order?

69
00:04:59,163 --> 00:05:02,298
How do you know all that?

70
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:04,025
Who told you?

71
00:05:04,126 --> 00:05:06,111
My sister knows the guy.

72
00:05:06,212 --> 00:05:10,740
He's always been a bit strange.
Got a bad reputation.

73
00:05:10,841 --> 00:05:12,934
Speaking of which, Boss.

74
00:05:13,469 --> 00:05:15,495
We'll accept a 10% penalty.

75
00:05:15,596 --> 00:05:16,580
In return.

76
00:05:16,681 --> 00:05:18,022
In return?

77
00:05:18,182 --> 00:05:20,667
Any thought of hiring
a new part-time worker?

78
00:05:20,768 --> 00:05:24,153
Sis, we need someone!

79
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:28,116
Ditch the guy you've got now.
Just fire him.

80
00:05:28,901 --> 00:05:32,036
Tomorrow I'll come for
a formal interview. What time?

81
00:05:32,321 --> 00:05:33,663
Wait, hold on a sec.

82
00:05:34,282 --> 00:05:36,541
Let me think about it.

83
00:05:37,076 --> 00:05:40,378
Then for now,
just pay for the boxes.

84
00:05:46,877 --> 00:05:50,346
So we’re all gathered here today.

85
00:05:50,631 --> 00:05:53,992
To celebrate the
reconnection of our phones,

86
00:05:54,093 --> 00:05:57,913
and this bounteous Wi-Fi!

87
00:05:58,014 --> 00:06:01,566
Look at that bastard.
It's not even dark yet.

88
00:06:02,101 --> 00:06:05,795
Why didn't you put up a
'No Urinating' sign?

89
00:06:05,896 --> 00:06:06,546
I told you!

90
00:06:06,647 --> 00:06:11,034
No, signs like that just make
them piss even more.

91
00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:13,345
At least shout at him!

92
00:06:13,446 --> 00:06:15,079
Don't shout.

93
00:06:15,197 --> 00:06:17,332
"Please don't piss!"

94
00:06:18,868 --> 00:06:21,961
Hey, is that Min?

95
00:06:22,496 --> 00:06:24,564
Hey mister,
that's not a toilet.

96
00:06:24,665 --> 00:06:25,982
Way to go, Min

97
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:28,151
Hey, punk!

98
00:06:28,252 --> 00:06:31,471
Who are you staring at,
asshole?

99
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:35,141
Come here!
You little shit.

100
00:06:36,761 --> 00:06:39,228
Get a fucking grip!

101
00:06:40,264 --> 00:06:42,290
That's an impressive friend.

102
00:06:42,391 --> 00:06:45,460
College students have
a real vigor to them.

103
00:06:45,561 --> 00:06:46,503
Not like my brother.

104
00:06:46,604 --> 00:06:50,006
But is he coming here?
Did you invite him?

105
00:06:50,107 --> 00:06:51,207
No.

106
00:06:51,317 --> 00:06:52,342
Hello!

107
00:06:52,443 --> 00:06:54,077
Oh hi, Min!

108
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,220
Min!

109
00:06:55,321 --> 00:06:56,096
Are you well, sir?

110
00:06:56,197 --> 00:06:58,890
- Sure.
- What are you doing here?

111
00:06:58,991 --> 00:07:00,583
I texted you.
Didn't you see it?

112
00:07:01,118 --> 00:07:02,185
Sorry, were you eating?

113
00:07:02,286 --> 00:07:03,478
No, we weren't eating.

114
00:07:03,579 --> 00:07:05,855
- How are you, Ki-jung?
- Fine, you too?

115
00:07:05,956 --> 00:07:08,692
We could've met outside,
why come here?

116
00:07:08,793 --> 00:07:09,526
Because of this.

117
00:07:09,627 --> 00:07:12,487
It's for you,
but it's so heavy.

118
00:07:12,588 --> 00:07:14,889
Really?
Put it down here.

119
00:07:16,926 --> 00:07:18,535
Wow, what is that?

120
00:07:18,636 --> 00:07:20,203
When I said I was meeting Ki-woo,

121
00:07:20,304 --> 00:07:23,564
my grandfather insisted
I bring this to you.

122
00:07:28,104 --> 00:07:30,279
Is this a landscape type?

123
00:07:31,398 --> 00:07:33,258
Or you can see it as
an abstract type.

124
00:07:33,359 --> 00:07:35,051
Wow, you know these!

125
00:07:35,152 --> 00:07:39,180
My grandpa has collected
scholar's rocks since his cadet days.

126
00:07:39,281 --> 00:07:42,809
Now the annex, the study,
every room in the house

127
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:44,894
is filled with these things.

128
00:07:44,995 --> 00:07:48,857
But this stone here is said to
bring material wealth to families...

129
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,299
Min!

130
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:53,570
This is so metaphorical.

131
00:07:53,671 --> 00:07:56,990
For sure.
It's a very opportune gift.

132
00:07:57,091 --> 00:07:57,782
Of course.

133
00:07:57,883 --> 00:08:01,936
Please relay our deepest thanks
to your grandpa.

134
00:08:02,471 --> 00:08:04,230
Food would be better.

135
00:08:14,024 --> 00:08:17,177
What was that called?
A landscape stone?

136
00:08:17,278 --> 00:08:18,595
You collect those rocks too?

137
00:08:18,696 --> 00:08:23,458
Hey, thanks to that rock I saw
your parents, they look healthy.

138
00:08:24,994 --> 00:08:28,963
They're plenty healthy,
just out of work.

139
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:34,051
Is Ki-jung taking lessons
these days?

140
00:08:34,587 --> 00:08:37,638
She can't afford lessons.

141
00:08:46,265 --> 00:08:47,857
Cute, huh?

142
00:08:48,767 --> 00:08:51,044
She's the one you're tutoring?

143
00:08:51,145 --> 00:08:53,588
Park Da-hye.
High school sophomore.

144
00:08:53,689 --> 00:08:57,074
You take over as her English tutor.

145
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,343
What do you mean?

146
00:08:58,444 --> 00:09:00,953
Tutor a rich kid.
It pays well.

147
00:09:01,989 --> 00:09:03,098
She's a nice girl.

148
00:09:03,199 --> 00:09:06,584
Look after her while
I'm studying abroad.

149
00:09:07,119 --> 00:09:10,480
What about your
university friends?

150
00:09:10,581 --> 00:09:14,175
Why ask a loser like me?

151
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:16,052
Why do you think?

152
00:09:16,587 --> 00:09:18,696
Just the thought makes me sick.

153
00:09:18,797 --> 00:09:22,951
Those disgusting frat boys
slavering over Da-hye?

154
00:09:23,052 --> 00:09:25,394
It's revolting.

155
00:09:30,935 --> 00:09:32,401
You like her?

156
00:09:37,441 --> 00:09:39,617
Hey, I'm serious.

157
00:09:40,653 --> 00:09:45,039
When she enters university,
I'll officially ask her out.

158
00:09:45,157 --> 00:09:46,933
So you take care of her
until then.

159
00:09:47,034 --> 00:09:51,546
If it's you,
I can leave in peace.

160
00:09:53,082 --> 00:09:55,758
Thanks for your trust,

161
00:09:55,876 --> 00:09:59,720
but do I have to pretend
to be a college student?

162
00:10:01,257 --> 00:10:04,225
Ki-woo, think about it.

163
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,163
For years including
your military service,

164
00:10:08,264 --> 00:10:10,582
you took the university
entrance exam 4 times.

165
00:10:10,683 --> 00:10:13,734
Grammar, vocabulary,
composition, conversation...

166
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,753
When it comes to English,

167
00:10:15,854 --> 00:10:20,199
you can teach 10 times better than
those drunken college pricks.

168
00:10:21,735 --> 00:10:24,328
- I guess so.
- Sure!

169
00:10:24,488 --> 00:10:28,183
But will they hire me?
I'm not a college student.

170
00:10:28,284 --> 00:10:29,809
Just fake it.

171
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:34,046
Don't worry, you'll have
my recommendation, plus...

172
00:10:34,582 --> 00:10:37,758
How should I describe the mother...?

173
00:10:39,795 --> 00:10:41,196
She's a bit simple.

174
00:10:41,297 --> 00:10:42,447
<i>Young and simple.</i>

175
00:10:42,548 --> 00:10:43,681
Simple?

176
00:10:44,216 --> 00:10:45,617
What do you mean?

177
00:10:45,718 --> 00:10:49,979
Anyway, it's all good.
I had fun there.

178
00:10:50,498 --> 00:10:51,498
So you agree?

179
00:10:51,599 --> 00:10:53,399
I guess so.

180
00:10:54,435 --> 00:10:58,338
Hey, you said your sister
is artistic?

181
00:10:58,439 --> 00:11:02,634
Good at Photoshop?

182
00:11:02,735 --> 00:11:06,846
God, with skills like this,
why can't you get into art school?

183
00:11:06,947 --> 00:11:08,581
Shut up.

184
00:11:10,743 --> 00:11:12,894
Hey, no smoking in here.

185
00:11:12,995 --> 00:11:14,395
Yeah, yeah.
Gimme that.

186
00:11:14,496 --> 00:11:15,671
Yeah.

187
00:11:20,002 --> 00:11:22,970
Now the cherry on top...

188
00:11:24,506 --> 00:11:28,910
Wow, does Oxford have a major
in document forgery?

189
00:11:29,011 --> 00:11:32,372
Ki-jung would be top of her class.

190
00:11:32,473 --> 00:11:35,166
She's amazing, huh?

191
00:11:35,267 --> 00:11:40,780
Our boy's going for a job interview.
Wish him luck.

192
00:11:41,315 --> 00:11:42,415
Son.

193
00:11:43,359 --> 00:11:46,327
I'm proud of you.

194
00:11:46,445 --> 00:11:47,545
Dad.

195
00:11:48,447 --> 00:11:51,683
I don't think of this
as forgery or crime.

196
00:11:51,784 --> 00:11:53,768
I'll go to this university
next year.

197
00:11:53,869 --> 00:11:57,355
So you've got a plan!

198
00:11:57,456 --> 00:12:01,634
I just printed out
the document a bit early.

199
00:12:36,787 --> 00:12:38,087
<i>Who is it?</i>

200
00:12:38,622 --> 00:12:40,440
Madame?
Good afternoon.

201
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:42,317
I'm here on
Min's recommendation...

202
00:12:42,418 --> 00:12:44,552
<i>Oh right, come in.</i>

203
00:12:45,587 --> 00:12:46,687
Thank you.

204
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:19,879
Hello!

205
00:13:20,622 --> 00:13:22,023
Hello, Madame.

206
00:13:22,124 --> 00:13:25,551
I just work here.
Come this way.

207
00:13:26,086 --> 00:13:27,695
The yard is so nice.

208
00:13:27,796 --> 00:13:29,430
The inside's nice too.

209
00:13:29,965 --> 00:13:33,250
You know the architect Namgoong?
He's famous.

210
00:13:33,351 --> 00:13:36,062
He used to live in this house.

211
00:13:38,223 --> 00:13:40,441
He designed it himself.

212
00:13:43,479 --> 00:13:48,449
As you can see,
now it's a playpen.

213
00:13:48,984 --> 00:13:50,084
This way.

214
00:13:52,488 --> 00:13:54,855
Sit yourself down here.
I'll bring the madame.

215
00:13:54,956 --> 00:13:56,056
Yes.

216
00:14:08,253 --> 00:14:09,512
Madame.

217
00:14:10,547 --> 00:14:11,764
Madame?

218
00:14:17,262 --> 00:14:18,771
Madame?

219
00:14:22,309 --> 00:14:24,735
He's here.
The tutoring candidate.

220
00:14:28,273 --> 00:14:30,491
I don't care about documents.

221
00:14:31,026 --> 00:14:33,577
Min recommended you,
after all.

222
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:40,334
As you know, Min is such
a brilliant human being.

223
00:14:40,869 --> 00:14:43,104
Da-hye and I were
quite happy with him.

224
00:14:43,205 --> 00:14:46,441
Regardless of her grades.
Know what I mean?

225
00:14:46,542 --> 00:14:47,642
Yes.

226
00:14:48,168 --> 00:14:49,819
He was marvelous.

227
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:56,842
So to be honest, we wanted to stick
with him through high school.

228
00:14:57,678 --> 00:15:01,021
But all of a sudden
he's going abroad.

229
00:15:03,183 --> 00:15:08,671
Anyway, excuse me,
but if I can speak directly,

230
00:15:08,772 --> 00:15:13,593
if you're not up to
Min's level, then,

231
00:15:13,694 --> 00:15:16,120
I'm not sure what the point is.

232
00:15:18,156 --> 00:15:21,893
So anyway,
what I want to say is,

233
00:15:21,994 --> 00:15:27,648
for your first lesson today,
do you mind if I sit in.

234
00:15:27,749 --> 00:15:31,719
I want to see it full time,
how you run your lesson.

235
00:15:33,755 --> 00:15:35,848
Is it okay with you?

236
00:16:03,994 --> 00:16:05,794
You sure about #24?

237
00:16:13,837 --> 00:16:18,449
Da-hye, you solved those later
problems then went back to #24.

238
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,225
Right?

239
00:16:21,762 --> 00:16:23,103
Yes.

240
00:16:30,729 --> 00:16:36,200
If that were the first question
on a real exam, you'd be screwed.

241
00:16:36,735 --> 00:16:40,371
Look at this.
Your pulse is racing.

242
00:16:42,908 --> 00:16:46,335
The heart doesn't lie.

243
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:50,439
An exam is like
slashing through a jungle.

244
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:53,384
Lose that momentum
and you're finished.

245
00:16:53,543 --> 00:16:55,903
The answer to #24?
I don't care.

246
00:16:56,004 --> 00:17:01,392
Slashing through the exam,
dominating it!

247
00:17:01,927 --> 00:17:03,811
That's all I care about.

248
00:17:04,846 --> 00:17:08,565
What you need is vigor.

249
00:17:09,643 --> 00:17:11,026
Vigor.

250
00:17:12,104 --> 00:17:13,529
Understand?

251
00:17:24,574 --> 00:17:27,351
So I'll pay you
this time each month.

252
00:17:27,452 --> 00:17:30,629
3 classes a week,
2 hours each, okay?

253
00:17:31,481 --> 00:17:32,481
As for the fee,

254
00:17:32,582 --> 00:17:36,319
I was going to pay Min's rate,
then I added a bit for inflation.

255
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,970
Thank you.

256
00:17:39,506 --> 00:17:41,490
How about a
proper introduction?

257
00:17:41,591 --> 00:17:44,518
Da-hye's tutor,
we'll call him Kevin.

258
00:17:45,137 --> 00:17:46,895
Mr. Kevin!

259
00:17:47,431 --> 00:17:50,791
If you feel like snacking during
your lesson, just call me.

260
00:17:50,892 --> 00:17:52,960
If you need anything, ask her.

261
00:17:53,061 --> 00:17:55,654
She knows this house
better than I...

262
00:17:55,814 --> 00:17:59,241
Da-song, stop it!

263
00:18:00,052 --> 00:18:01,052
I'm sorry, did he startle you?

264
00:18:01,153 --> 00:18:03,596
How cute.
His name's Da-song?

265
00:18:03,697 --> 00:18:05,514
Yes, our youngest.

266
00:18:05,615 --> 00:18:07,141
Da-song, come say hi!

267
00:18:07,242 --> 00:18:08,959
This is Mr. Kevin!

268
00:18:11,496 --> 00:18:15,566
This is an Indian arrow.
I ordered it from the U.S.

269
00:18:15,667 --> 00:18:18,969
From last year he's been
an Indian fanatic.

270
00:18:21,006 --> 00:18:22,106
Indians?

271
00:18:22,674 --> 00:18:25,409
He's got a fanboy personality?

272
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:29,080
Well, he's eccentric
and easily distracted.

273
00:18:29,181 --> 00:18:31,982
He can barely sit still!

274
00:18:32,142 --> 00:18:34,293
So last year I enrolled him
in Cub Scouts.

275
00:18:34,394 --> 00:18:37,338
hoping he'd learn
moderation and focus.

276
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,947
But look.

277
00:18:39,983 --> 00:18:41,158
He's even worse.

278
00:18:43,695 --> 00:18:48,832
His scout leader is an
Indian fanatic, maybe that's why.

279
00:18:49,367 --> 00:18:53,562
The American Indian is
the very spirit of the Cub Scouts.

280
00:18:53,663 --> 00:18:54,605
It's a good thing.

281
00:18:54,706 --> 00:18:57,817
Were you a Cub Scout, Kevin?

282
00:18:57,918 --> 00:19:01,112
Sure. I'm a Scout by nature.

283
00:19:01,213 --> 00:19:05,599
Da-song is an artist by nature.
Look at this painting.

284
00:19:05,967 --> 00:19:09,412
It’s so metaphorical.
It's really strong.

285
00:19:09,513 --> 00:19:11,163
Strong, right?

286
00:19:11,264 --> 00:19:13,565
You've got an eye for this.

287
00:19:14,684 --> 00:19:16,168
It's a chimpanzee, right?

288
00:19:16,269 --> 00:19:18,028
A self-portrait.

289
00:19:21,066 --> 00:19:22,866
Sure enough!

290
00:19:23,902 --> 00:19:27,138
The perspective of a young artist
eludes understanding.

291
00:19:27,239 --> 00:19:29,682
Or perhaps it's Da-song's
expressive genius...

292
00:19:29,783 --> 00:19:35,229
Anyway, we've been through
so many art teachers.

293
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:37,589
None of them lasts
even a month.

294
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:42,219
And Da-song is just
so hard to control.

295
00:19:44,756 --> 00:19:47,224
- Just a moment. Madame.
- Yes?

296
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:51,145
Someone just came to mind.

297
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,188
What was her name?

298
00:19:53,723 --> 00:19:56,208
Jessica!
Right, Jessica...

299
00:19:56,309 --> 00:20:00,612
She was in the same
art school as my cousin.

300
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:03,299
What was her Korean name?

301
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:08,429
Anyway, after studying applied arts
at Illinois State University,

302
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:10,431
she returned to Korea.

303
00:20:10,532 --> 00:20:12,975
Illinois... tell me more.

304
00:20:13,076 --> 00:20:19,465
Her teaching is unusual, but she
knows how to handle kids.

305
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,843
She's got a special
reputation in her field.

306
00:20:23,378 --> 00:20:25,571
But even though her methods
are unique,

307
00:20:25,672 --> 00:20:27,948
she can help kids
get into good art schools.

308
00:20:28,049 --> 00:20:32,186
Now I'm really curious.
What is she like?

309
00:20:32,721 --> 00:20:34,313
Would you like to meet her?

310
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:37,733
Though I heard
she's in high demand...

311
00:20:43,648 --> 00:20:44,823
Hold on.

312
00:20:46,443 --> 00:20:49,929
Jessica, only child,
Illinois Chicago,

313
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:53,248
classmate Kim Jin-mo,
he's your cousin.

314
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:04,151
Look at how he painted
the side dishes on the tablecloth

315
00:21:04,252 --> 00:21:06,654
in this mosaic arrangement.

316
00:21:06,755 --> 00:21:09,448
But within that too,
there are repeating patterns.

317
00:21:09,549 --> 00:21:12,827
Gochujang is red,
the rice... well, anyway,

318
00:21:12,928 --> 00:21:17,940
he has a Basquiat-esque sense,
even at age 9!

319
00:21:18,475 --> 00:21:20,042
How exciting.

320
00:21:20,143 --> 00:21:25,280
I'm sure Miss Jessica must have
already sensed this,

321
00:21:25,398 --> 00:21:29,451
so I'll leave you two,
and go up for Da-hye's lesson.

322
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:31,679
Have a nice lesson, Jessica.

323
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,747
Yes, thank you
for the introduction.

324
00:21:37,786 --> 00:21:43,298
So as you can see,
Da-song's eccentric genius...

325
00:21:45,835 --> 00:21:46,935
Da-hye.

326
00:21:47,379 --> 00:21:50,681
So we'll start with #38?

327
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,245
Kevin.

328
00:21:56,346 --> 00:21:57,563
Yeah?

329
00:21:57,681 --> 00:22:02,943
Did you know that
Da-song is faking it all?

330
00:22:03,061 --> 00:22:05,671
Huh? What do you mean?

331
00:22:05,772 --> 00:22:07,464
It's all a show.

332
00:22:07,565 --> 00:22:11,302
Acting like a genius, that
4th dimension stuff is all fake.

333
00:22:11,403 --> 00:22:13,036
An artist cosplay.

334
00:22:13,571 --> 00:22:14,830
Da-song?

335
00:22:16,366 --> 00:22:17,600
You know that thing,

336
00:22:17,701 --> 00:22:22,087
when he freezes and stares at
the sky, as if struck by inspiration.

337
00:22:22,622 --> 00:22:28,385
So he's walking along, then he
stares at the clouds for 10 minutes.

338
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,571
So you know what I mean?

339
00:22:30,672 --> 00:22:33,240
He gives me the creeps.

340
00:22:33,341 --> 00:22:36,768
He pretends that he
can't live a normal life.

341
00:22:37,304 --> 00:22:38,621
Makes me want to puke.

342
00:22:38,722 --> 00:22:41,898
So Da-song is pretending...

343
00:22:42,475 --> 00:22:46,653
But what's that got to do with
your studies?

344
00:22:50,692 --> 00:22:54,369
Well, I'm just saying.

345
00:22:56,906 --> 00:22:58,874
Sure, so in that sense,

346
00:22:59,951 --> 00:23:04,296
what you told me about Da-song
was very interesting,

347
00:23:04,831 --> 00:23:06,673
so let's write about it in English.

348
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:12,888
And be sure to use the word
'pretend' at least twice.

349
00:23:13,423 --> 00:23:16,367
Then, can I ask you a question?

350
00:23:16,468 --> 00:23:17,534
Sure.

351
00:23:17,635 --> 00:23:20,103
That teacher Jessica.

352
00:23:21,139 --> 00:23:27,736
Is she really
your cousin's classmate?

353
00:23:29,272 --> 00:23:30,839
What do you mean?

354
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:33,325
She's your girlfriend, right?

355
00:23:36,363 --> 00:23:40,457
No way...
I just met her today.

356
00:23:44,496 --> 00:23:47,506
Jessica's really pretty.
isn't she?

357
00:23:48,041 --> 00:23:50,217
Aren't you interested?

358
00:23:51,252 --> 00:23:52,861
You saw her?

359
00:23:52,962 --> 00:23:57,366
Sure, she's pretty.
She's a beautiful woman.

360
00:23:57,467 --> 00:23:58,567
Yeah.

361
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,980
I knew it.

362
00:24:04,516 --> 00:24:06,775
So you are interested.

363
00:24:09,312 --> 00:24:10,946
Da-hye...

364
00:24:13,066 --> 00:24:19,805
So, if we can compare
Jessica to a rose,

365
00:24:19,906 --> 00:24:21,456
then you are...

366
00:25:07,537 --> 00:25:08,896
- Let's study.
- Yes.

367
00:25:08,997 --> 00:25:14,360
Please understand that my boy
has trouble keeping still.

368
00:25:14,461 --> 00:25:15,969
I understand.

369
00:25:16,504 --> 00:25:17,604
Da-song!

370
00:25:18,365 --> 00:25:19,365
Da-song, get up!

371
00:25:19,466 --> 00:25:21,183
Come on, Da-song!

372
00:25:22,077 --> 00:25:23,077
In your butt...

373
00:25:23,178 --> 00:25:26,080
- Madame, please leave us.
- What?

374
00:25:26,181 --> 00:25:28,523
I never teach with
a parent in the room.

375
00:25:29,058 --> 00:25:31,377
But today is our first day,
and as you can see, he's...

376
00:25:31,478 --> 00:25:33,528
Wait downstairs.

377
00:25:35,006 --> 00:25:36,006
Park Da-song?

378
00:25:36,107 --> 00:25:37,324
Da-song!

379
00:25:41,362 --> 00:25:42,788
Madame?

380
00:25:43,823 --> 00:25:45,140
Want some plum extract?

381
00:25:45,241 --> 00:25:46,225
What?

382
00:25:46,326 --> 00:25:49,645
It's mixed with honey.
To ease your tension.

383
00:25:49,746 --> 00:25:52,172
Yeah, that would be great

384
00:26:06,721 --> 00:26:08,480
- Hey.
- Yes?

385
00:26:09,015 --> 00:26:10,124
I've got an idea.

386
00:26:10,225 --> 00:26:13,485
Take two glasses of plum extract
to Da-song's room.

387
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:16,755
You're not a parent,
so you can go in!

388
00:26:16,856 --> 00:26:18,298
Oh, that's right!

389
00:26:18,399 --> 00:26:21,260
Then I'll report back
on what's going on in there...

390
00:26:21,361 --> 00:26:24,079
Why didn't I think of it earlier?

391
00:26:26,346 --> 00:26:27,446
What?

392
00:26:27,617 --> 00:26:29,101
They came out?

393
00:26:29,202 --> 00:26:30,752
Yeah.

394
00:26:32,872 --> 00:26:36,049
So you're done already?

395
00:26:37,585 --> 00:26:38,885
Madame.

396
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:41,388
Come sit next to me.

397
00:26:43,424 --> 00:26:45,058
Da-song, go upstairs.

398
00:26:47,095 --> 00:26:48,195
Hurry up!

399
00:26:54,811 --> 00:26:56,712
Da-son just painted this.

400
00:26:56,813 --> 00:26:58,238
I see...

401
00:26:59,774 --> 00:27:02,259
I'd rather speak with
Madame alone.

402
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,510
Oh, but she is...

403
00:27:03,611 --> 00:27:06,580
No, leave us.

404
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:16,857
Madame, I told you I study
art psychology and art therapy?

405
00:27:16,958 --> 00:27:18,133
Yes.

406
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:21,678
Did anything happen to Da-song
in first grade?

407
00:27:24,215 --> 00:27:26,683
To be frank,

408
00:27:27,218 --> 00:27:30,204
before I decide whether
to take on Da-song,

409
00:27:30,305 --> 00:27:33,064
I need to hear about this.

410
00:27:33,182 --> 00:27:37,177
But this is hard for me
to talk about right now.

411
00:27:37,278 --> 00:27:38,128
What to do?

412
00:27:38,229 --> 00:27:39,904
Never mind, then.

413
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:45,385
The lower-right region of a painting
is called the 'schizophrenia zone'.

414
00:27:45,486 --> 00:27:47,971
Psychotic symptoms often
reveal themselves here.

415
00:27:48,072 --> 00:27:48,972
Oh, phrenia...

416
00:27:49,073 --> 00:27:50,057
Look here.

417
00:27:50,158 --> 00:27:52,726
Da-song painted this
unusual shape, right?

418
00:27:52,827 --> 00:27:54,044
I see.

419
00:27:56,289 --> 00:27:58,941
Over there, it's the same!
It's the same, right?

420
00:27:59,042 --> 00:28:01,217
Yes, that's correct.

421
00:28:01,336 --> 00:28:05,030
A similar shape in the same zone.
You see it now?

422
00:28:05,131 --> 00:28:06,389
Yes.

423
00:28:06,924 --> 00:28:11,245
I've stared at that painting
at every meal!

424
00:28:11,346 --> 00:28:13,497
But I had no idea.

425
00:28:13,598 --> 00:28:16,733
Calm down.
Let's compose ourselves.

426
00:28:17,268 --> 00:28:20,278
This is all a black box
into Da-song's mind.

427
00:28:20,813 --> 00:28:24,574
Would you like to open
that box with me, Madame?

428
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:26,843
I want to open it.

429
00:28:26,944 --> 00:28:31,348
Then we'll need 4
two-hour sessions per week,

430
00:28:31,449 --> 00:28:35,686
and this is not simple tutoring,
it's art therapy, right?

431
00:28:35,787 --> 00:28:36,645
Of course.

432
00:28:36,746 --> 00:28:40,632
Because of that my rate is set
at a very high level.

433
00:28:41,234 --> 00:28:42,234
Are you okay with that?

434
00:28:42,335 --> 00:28:44,010
It's my pleasure.

435
00:28:45,546 --> 00:28:47,263
Da-songs dad is home.

436
00:28:53,805 --> 00:28:57,982
Honey, Da-song's new
art teacher is here.

437
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,821
Her name's Jessica,
from Illinois.

438
00:29:03,356 --> 00:29:05,365
Jessica! This is Dong-ik.

439
00:29:05,525 --> 00:29:07,301
- Hello.
- Hi.

440
00:29:07,402 --> 00:29:09,244
Thanks for your help.

441
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:10,679
Class is over?

442
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:11,880
Yes, just finished.

443
00:29:12,307 --> 00:29:13,307
- Driver Yoon.
- Yes?

444
00:29:13,408 --> 00:29:14,975
- Are you free?
- Yes, I am.

445
00:29:15,076 --> 00:29:17,644
Then give her a lift, okay?

446
00:29:17,745 --> 00:29:22,190
Sure, we don't want her
going down alone at night, right?

447
00:29:22,291 --> 00:29:23,550
Of course.

448
00:29:23,709 --> 00:29:25,093
Miss Jessica?

449
00:29:25,628 --> 00:29:31,141
Shall I drive you
all the way home, then?

450
00:29:32,176 --> 00:29:34,536
- Which neighborhood?
- No. that's fine

451
00:29:34,637 --> 00:29:38,440
You can just drop me off
at Hyehwa station.

452
00:29:38,583 --> 00:29:39,583
Thank you.

453
00:29:39,684 --> 00:29:40,959
I don't mind if it's far away.

454
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:45,255
- My shift is finished, anyway.
- I'll get off at Hyehwa.

455
00:29:45,356 --> 00:29:48,783
Looks like it's going to rain.

456
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:52,554
Ride the Benz, not the subway!

457
00:29:52,655 --> 00:29:56,124
I'm meeting my boyfriend
at exit 3 of Hyehwa Station!

458
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:58,760
Yes.

459
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:37,540
Dad, when you worked as a driver,
did you drive a lot of Benzes?

460
00:30:38,075 --> 00:30:44,422
Benzes? Not then, but I did
when I worked as a valet.

461
00:30:44,957 --> 00:30:47,442
You worked as a valet?

462
00:30:47,543 --> 00:30:51,279
Sure, after the chicken place went bust,
before the Taiwan cake shop,

463
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:53,198
in that 6-month window?

464
00:30:53,299 --> 00:30:57,101
No, it was after
the cake shop went bust.

465
00:30:59,722 --> 00:31:01,898
We're moving to
the next stage already?

466
00:31:02,433 --> 00:31:06,044
I set a trap in the Benz.

467
00:31:06,145 --> 00:31:08,029
Then we're diving right in.

468
00:31:08,564 --> 00:31:10,465
Wow this is so metaphorical.

469
00:31:10,566 --> 00:31:13,952
Look Dad, we're eating in a
driver's cafeteria right now!

470
00:31:14,737 --> 00:31:16,746
Right, a driver's cafeteria!

471
00:31:17,281 --> 00:31:19,141
Eat as much as you want, kids.

472
00:31:19,242 --> 00:31:22,168
You didn't even pay for it.
they did!

473
00:31:22,537 --> 00:31:25,313
Son, have some more.
Eat up!

474
00:31:25,414 --> 00:31:26,231
Yes, Dad.

475
00:31:26,332 --> 00:31:27,357
Eat your fill!

476
00:31:27,458 --> 00:31:29,693
What did you do
to that woman yesterday?

477
00:31:29,794 --> 00:31:30,444
What?

478
00:31:30,545 --> 00:31:32,237
She was freaking out.

479
00:31:32,338 --> 00:31:34,681
Saying she was so moved,
you put her in shock.

480
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,158
Fuck. I don't know!

481
00:31:36,259 --> 00:31:40,144
I googled 'art therapy'.
and ad-libbed the rest.

482
00:31:40,263 --> 00:31:42,831
Then suddenly she's weeping.

483
00:31:42,932 --> 00:31:45,316
Crazy bitch,
I couldn't believe it.

484
00:32:18,509 --> 00:32:20,952
Oh, you're home?

485
00:32:21,053 --> 00:32:22,770
Did you eat yet?

486
00:32:24,557 --> 00:32:26,041
Is something wrong?

487
00:32:26,142 --> 00:32:27,459
Is the housekeeper out?

488
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,611
She's walking the dogs.

489
00:32:30,187 --> 00:32:31,613
Honey.

490
00:32:32,648 --> 00:32:34,866
This was under my car seat.

491
00:32:37,403 --> 00:32:39,621
Driver Yoon is such a scumbag.

492
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:41,080
What is this?

493
00:32:42,116 --> 00:32:43,350
I'm sorry, honey.

494
00:32:43,451 --> 00:32:45,560
I didn’t know he was
this kind of guy.

495
00:32:45,661 --> 00:32:48,755
Don't you pay him well?

496
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:52,275
Is he saving up by
not paying for a motel?

497
00:32:52,376 --> 00:32:53,818
He must be a pervert.

498
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:55,195
He likes it in the car.

499
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:59,199
Oh, that's gross.
In his boss' car!

500
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:03,937
A young guy's sex life is
his own business, that's all fine.

501
00:33:07,475 --> 00:33:09,984
But why in my car?

502
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:15,048
And if so, why not in his seat?
Why cross the line like that?

503
00:33:15,149 --> 00:33:16,699
You're right.

504
00:33:17,234 --> 00:33:20,136
Does dripping his sperm
on my seat turn him on?

505
00:33:20,237 --> 00:33:22,413
I can't believe this.

506
00:33:26,952 --> 00:33:31,130
But you know what's
strangest of all?

507
00:33:31,791 --> 00:33:33,007
What?

508
00:33:34,043 --> 00:33:36,361
Usually if you have car sex,

509
00:33:36,462 --> 00:33:41,741
you might leave behind
a strand of hair, or an earring.

510
00:33:41,842 --> 00:33:42,951
Right.

511
00:33:43,052 --> 00:33:46,896
But how can you forget
your own panties?

512
00:33:47,431 --> 00:33:51,317
That's right.
It's hard to overlook.

513
00:33:52,353 --> 00:33:56,614
So it makes me quite suspicious
of this woman's condition.

514
00:33:57,650 --> 00:33:58,866
You get me?

515
00:34:08,452 --> 00:34:10,020
Oh my... meth or cocaine?

516
00:34:10,121 --> 00:34:11,838
Shh! The kids...

517
00:34:12,373 --> 00:34:13,565
What do we do?

518
00:34:13,666 --> 00:34:16,318
What if anyone finds
white powder in your car?

519
00:34:16,419 --> 00:34:19,012
Calm down, relax.

520
00:34:19,547 --> 00:34:21,055
Relax.

521
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:24,892
For now it's just supposition.
A rational guess.

522
00:34:25,428 --> 00:34:27,078
But no need to call the police.

523
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:29,022
Not that!

524
00:34:29,598 --> 00:34:35,378
Still, for a busy man like me to ask,
"Why are you fucking in my car?"

525
00:34:35,479 --> 00:34:36,588
Exactly.

526
00:34:36,689 --> 00:34:38,506
So instead...

527
00:34:38,607 --> 00:34:43,637
Can you just invent some
bland excuse to let him go?

528
00:34:43,738 --> 00:34:45,096
Okay sure.

529
00:34:45,197 --> 00:34:48,558
No need to mention
panties or car sex.

530
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:50,644
We don't need to stoop
to that level, do we?

531
00:34:50,745 --> 00:34:52,754
Surely not!

532
00:34:53,289 --> 00:34:56,149
But what if he goes online
and accuses us...

533
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:58,259
Just give him a good severance.

534
00:34:58,794 --> 00:35:02,072
How was Da-song today?

535
00:35:02,173 --> 00:35:04,265
He was fine.

536
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,910
- So class is finished?
- Yes.

537
00:35:07,011 --> 00:35:09,579
Jessica, the last time you came,

538
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,123
our driver gave you a ride, right?

539
00:35:12,224 --> 00:35:13,083
That's right.

540
00:35:13,184 --> 00:35:15,543
This may be an odd question,

541
00:35:15,644 --> 00:35:17,528
but nothing happened then?

542
00:35:17,646 --> 00:35:19,005
No, he was very nice.

543
00:35:19,106 --> 00:35:20,966
I told him to go
to Hyehwa Station,

544
00:35:21,067 --> 00:35:24,344
but he insisted on
driving me home.

545
00:35:24,445 --> 00:35:27,597
That jerk!
He took you home late at night?

546
00:35:27,698 --> 00:35:29,374
Revealing where you live?

547
00:35:30,409 --> 00:35:32,686
No, I got off at Hyehwa.

548
00:35:32,787 --> 00:35:35,146
Oh, good girl. Very good.

549
00:35:35,247 --> 00:35:36,815
Jessica nice...

550
00:35:36,916 --> 00:35:39,275
Did something happen with him?

551
00:35:39,376 --> 00:35:44,572
He won't be working for us any more.
A slightly shameful incident.

552
00:35:44,673 --> 00:35:46,616
What incident?

553
00:35:46,717 --> 00:35:49,685
Oh, you don't need to know.

554
00:35:51,222 --> 00:35:54,833
But I'm surprised.
He was so gentlemanly and cool.

555
00:35:54,934 --> 00:35:58,253
Jessica, you're too
young and innocent!

556
00:35:58,354 --> 00:36:00,446
You have a lot to learn about people.

557
00:36:01,482 --> 00:36:06,052
But we were excited to have
such a young, hip driver, too.

558
00:36:06,153 --> 00:36:09,347
But isn't an older driver better?

559
00:36:09,448 --> 00:36:13,435
That's true. They drive better,
have better manners.

560
00:36:13,536 --> 00:36:16,187
My father's brother had
a driver just like that.

561
00:36:16,288 --> 00:36:20,734
Mr. Kim.
He was so congenial and nice,

562
00:36:20,835 --> 00:36:23,361
I used to call him Uncle
when I was young.

563
00:36:23,462 --> 00:36:25,447
You know a man like that?

564
00:36:25,548 --> 00:36:28,599
Yes, he was so mild-mannered.

565
00:36:29,135 --> 00:36:33,896
Oh, but my relatives
relocated to Chicago.

566
00:36:34,974 --> 00:36:37,167
I wonder if
Mr. Kim's free now?

567
00:36:37,268 --> 00:36:41,254
I'm really interested!
Could I meet him?

568
00:36:41,355 --> 00:36:42,422
Really?

569
00:36:42,523 --> 00:36:44,907
I don't trust anyone now.

570
00:36:45,442 --> 00:36:48,344
I only trust someone recommended
by a person I know well.

571
00:36:48,445 --> 00:36:53,124
But if you've known him so long,
I'd feel much more at ease.

572
00:36:55,703 --> 00:36:57,753
Do you really want to meet him?

573
00:36:58,289 --> 00:36:59,797
I'm deadly serious.

574
00:37:00,332 --> 00:37:03,885
This chain of
recommendations is best.

575
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:05,636
How should I describe it?

576
00:37:05,796 --> 00:37:07,221
A belt of trust?

577
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:08,740
- This one's different.
- Here.

578
00:37:08,841 --> 00:37:09,407
Oh, right.

579
00:37:09,508 --> 00:37:11,142
And this one.

580
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:12,786
Looks like a touch screen now.

581
00:37:12,887 --> 00:37:15,789
It's not touch,
it says you have to turn it.

582
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:17,940
Wow, this thing?

583
00:37:18,375 --> 00:37:19,375
Sir?

584
00:37:19,476 --> 00:37:21,819
Taking our time, are we?

585
00:37:24,417 --> 00:37:26,246
This is a nice car.

586
00:37:29,195 --> 00:37:30,411
This is en
it! Come over here.

587
00:37:34,116 --> 00:37:35,666
He's in a meeting now.

588
00:37:40,706 --> 00:37:42,715
Have a seat and wait here.

589
00:37:51,342 --> 00:37:54,810
Hello, nice to meet...

590
00:37:57,932 --> 00:37:59,415
But is it compatible
with a phone?

591
00:37:59,516 --> 00:38:06,197
Oh, not with a phone.
You need more computing power.

592
00:38:07,316 --> 00:38:11,953
This isn't any sort of test,
so don't be nervous.

593
00:38:12,696 --> 00:38:15,748
I was worn out at the office,
so I came out for a bit.

594
00:38:16,283 --> 00:38:17,433
I understand.

595
00:38:17,534 --> 00:38:22,129
Constant chatter, all that bother.
At least the car is peaceful.

596
00:38:24,541 --> 00:38:25,841
Thank you.

597
00:38:26,877 --> 00:38:28,069
You seem to know
the road well?

598
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:31,489
Anything below the 38th parallel.

599
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:34,850
After 30 years behind the wheel,
the car almost drives itself.

600
00:38:35,386 --> 00:38:38,020
I respect those who work
in one field for a long time.

601
00:38:38,264 --> 00:38:41,249
Well, to be honest
this is a simple vocation.

602
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:44,360
But... the head of a household,

603
00:38:44,895 --> 00:38:46,045
the leader of a company?

604
00:38:46,146 --> 00:38:51,659
Or else just a lonely man setting off
on the road each morning...

605
00:38:52,528 --> 00:38:54,287
It's companionship of a sort,

606
00:38:54,446 --> 00:38:57,348
so that's how
I've approached each day.

607
00:38:57,449 --> 00:38:59,333
The years sure pass quickly.

608
00:39:03,038 --> 00:39:05,673
Sure enough,
your cornering is excellent.

609
00:39:06,375 --> 00:39:12,739
Well, it may look simple,
but it's one of the fundamentals.

610
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:17,602
<i>She may look like a sheep,
but inside, she's a fox.</i>

611
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,813
<i>Sometimes she acts like
she owns the house.</i>

612
00:39:21,332 --> 00:39:22,332
<i>Right.</i>

613
00:39:22,433 --> 00:39:26,920
<i>Of all the people in that house,
she's lived there the longest.</i>

614
00:39:27,021 --> 00:39:30,673
<i>She was housekeeper
to the architect Namgoong,</i>

615
00:39:30,774 --> 00:39:35,453
<i>but then she went on
to work for this family.</i>

616
00:39:35,988 --> 00:39:37,347
<i>When the architect moved out,</i>

617
00:39:37,448 --> 00:39:40,350
<i>he introduced this woman
to Park's family,</i>

618
00:39:40,451 --> 00:39:43,794
<i>telling them, "This is a great
housekeeper, you should hire her."</i>

619
00:39:43,912 --> 00:39:47,232
<i>So she survived
a change of ownership.</i>

620
00:39:47,333 --> 00:39:50,384
She won't give up good job easily.

621
00:39:50,919 --> 00:39:54,055
To extract a woman like that,
we need to prepare well.

622
00:39:55,758 --> 00:39:58,100
Right, we need a plan.

623
00:39:59,136 --> 00:40:02,688
I want to eat peaches.
I like peaches best.

624
00:40:03,223 --> 00:40:04,332
Why not ask for some?

625
00:40:04,433 --> 00:40:08,194
No peaches at our house.
It's a forbidden fruit.

626
00:40:15,861 --> 00:40:18,721
<i>So according to what
Da-hye told me,</i>

627
00:40:18,822 --> 00:40:23,434
<i>she's got a massively serious
allergy to peaches.</i>

628
00:40:23,535 --> 00:40:26,771
<i>You know that fuzz
on a peach's skin?</i>

629
00:40:26,872 --> 00:40:30,483
<i>If she's anywhere near it,
she gets a full body rash,</i>

630
00:40:30,584 --> 00:40:34,553
<i>has trouble breathing,
asthma, a total meltdown!</i>

631
00:40:39,093 --> 00:40:43,229
No no, there weren't
any peaches anywhere.

632
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:47,358
That's what I'm saying!

633
00:40:47,601 --> 00:40:50,086
Usually when I get
symptoms like this,

634
00:40:50,187 --> 00:40:53,589
I run to my room
and take my medicine,

635
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:59,053
but it was so sudden,
I wasn't sure where I left it.

636
00:40:59,154 --> 00:41:04,183
Madame, this woman
behind me, is that?

637
00:41:04,284 --> 00:41:06,185
Oh, it's our housekeeper!

638
00:41:06,286 --> 00:41:08,938
So it's true.
Oh, how sad.

639
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:12,025
I wasn't sure if that
was really her.

640
00:41:12,126 --> 00:41:15,886
I've only seen her a couple times
in the living room.

641
00:41:16,422 --> 00:41:18,406
This was in the hospital?

642
00:41:18,507 --> 00:41:22,435
A few days ago I went for
my annual medical exam.

643
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:26,981
I took a selfie for my wife,
and there she was behind me.

644
00:41:27,474 --> 00:41:29,483
Is she talking
on the phone there?

645
00:41:29,685 --> 00:41:34,839
Anyway. I wasn't trying to eavesdrop...

646
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:36,758
but her words came through clearly!

647
00:41:36,859 --> 00:41:38,593
- So I couldn't help but..
- Cut, cut!

648
00:41:38,694 --> 00:41:41,554
Dad, your emotions are up to here.

649
00:41:41,655 --> 00:41:43,914
Bring them down to about there.

650
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:46,893
...so I couldn't help but overhear.

651
00:41:46,994 --> 00:41:49,754
Keep it focused!

652
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:53,566
What I'm trying to say is,
it's just that,

653
00:41:53,667 --> 00:41:57,887
your housekeeper's voice
is quite loud, you know?

654
00:41:58,046 --> 00:42:01,574
I understand, it's all right.
Just tell me, okay?

655
00:42:01,675 --> 00:42:04,494
She said she got diagnosed
with active TB,

656
00:42:04,595 --> 00:42:06,662
and she was shouting
on the phone,

657
00:42:06,763 --> 00:42:09,832
so upset she could
barely control herself!

658
00:42:09,933 --> 00:42:12,251
Tuberculosis? Come on...

659
00:42:12,352 --> 00:42:17,698
It's true, she phoned someone
saying she had active TB.

660
00:42:18,233 --> 00:42:22,828
Do people still get TB?

661
00:42:23,022 --> 00:42:24,122
Dad...

662
00:42:24,364 --> 00:42:29,352
Back in the day, people used
to buy Christmas Seals, right?

663
00:42:29,453 --> 00:42:30,770
Feels like a bygone era.

664
00:42:30,871 --> 00:42:32,522
But I saw it on the internet.

665
00:42:32,623 --> 00:42:36,442
Korea has the #1 rate of TB
of all the OECD countries.

666
00:42:36,543 --> 00:42:40,071
But she's still working,
as if nothing's wrong.

667
00:42:40,172 --> 00:42:42,115
With a kid like Da-song
in the house.

668
00:42:42,216 --> 00:42:45,493
So you've got a young kid
like Da-song in the house,

669
00:42:45,594 --> 00:42:48,830
and a TB patient is doing dishes,
cooking, spraying spittle...

670
00:42:48,931 --> 00:42:50,564
Stop it, please!

671
00:42:54,853 --> 00:42:56,862
Dad: arriving in 3 mins

672
00:43:43,402 --> 00:43:47,413
If you get the chance,
this'll be icing on the cake.

673
00:44:17,603 --> 00:44:19,295
Madame

674
00:44:19,396 --> 00:44:22,781
2nd floor sauna room

675
00:44:32,826 --> 00:44:34,418
- Have a seat
- Yes.

676
00:44:36,563 --> 00:44:37,563
Mr. Kim.

677
00:44:37,664 --> 00:44:41,734
Please don't tell any of this
to my husband, okay?

678
00:44:41,835 --> 00:44:42,860
Understood.

679
00:44:42,961 --> 00:44:47,640
If he hears I brought a
TB patient to our home,

680
00:44:47,799 --> 00:44:50,535
I'll be hanged
and quartered!

681
00:44:50,636 --> 00:44:52,537
Don't worry, Madame.

682
00:44:52,638 --> 00:44:56,249
And if I may presume
to say one thing.

683
00:44:56,350 --> 00:44:59,652
I have no feelings
against that woman.

684
00:45:00,187 --> 00:45:07,276
I felt I had to speak up for the
sake of public health and hygiene

685
00:45:07,653 --> 00:45:11,180
But this could be seen
as snitching or...

686
00:45:11,281 --> 00:45:12,682
Don't you worry.

687
00:45:12,783 --> 00:45:15,351
I won't mention the TB.

688
00:45:15,452 --> 00:45:17,895
I'll just make up some excuse
to dismiss her.

689
00:45:17,996 --> 00:45:19,505
Simply and quietly.

690
00:45:21,124 --> 00:45:23,818
It's a proven method.
That's the best.

691
00:45:23,919 --> 00:45:25,844
Okay, then.

692
00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:40,067
Have you...
washed your hands?

693
00:46:25,564 --> 00:46:29,634
Mr. Kim, do you know
a good braised ribs place?

694
00:46:29,735 --> 00:46:31,385
Somewhere close by.

695
00:46:31,486 --> 00:46:32,845
Sure.

696
00:46:32,946 --> 00:46:36,707
- Then you'll be eating out?
- That's right.

697
00:46:37,325 --> 00:46:40,252
Why such a craving for
braised ribs today?

698
00:46:40,787 --> 00:46:43,672
Our old housekeeper made
delicious ribs.

699
00:46:44,708 --> 00:46:46,776
The one who quit this week?

700
00:46:46,877 --> 00:46:51,847
My wife wouldn't even
tell me why she quit.

701
00:46:54,468 --> 00:46:59,855
Sure, it's easy enough
to hire a new one.

702
00:47:00,891 --> 00:47:05,503
Still, it's a shame.
She was a great housekeeper

703
00:47:05,604 --> 00:47:06,504
I see.

704
00:47:06,605 --> 00:47:09,173
She kept the house
in great shape,

705
00:47:09,274 --> 00:47:11,950
and she knew never to
cross the line.

706
00:47:12,486 --> 00:47:15,370
I can't stand people
who cross the line.

707
00:47:15,906 --> 00:47:18,582
Perhaps just one weak point?

708
00:47:19,201 --> 00:47:20,685
Eating too much.

709
00:47:20,786 --> 00:47:23,712
She always ate enough for two.

710
00:47:24,372 --> 00:47:28,234
But considering
all the work she did...

711
00:47:28,335 --> 00:47:33,698
Then you better find someone new.
A new housekeeper.

712
00:47:33,799 --> 00:47:35,825
We're in trouble now.

713
00:47:35,926 --> 00:47:40,395
In a week,
our house will be a trash can.

714
00:47:41,431 --> 00:47:44,441
My clothes will start to smell.

715
00:47:45,477 --> 00:47:48,379
My wife has no talent
for housework.

716
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:51,782
She's bad at cleaning,
and her cooking's awful.

717
00:47:52,818 --> 00:47:54,701
Still, you love her, right?

718
00:48:02,369 --> 00:48:05,712
Of course.
I love her.

719
00:48:06,748 --> 00:48:08,632
We'll call it love.

720
00:48:10,252 --> 00:48:12,427
Then would this help?

721
00:48:16,466 --> 00:48:18,659
The Care?
What is this?

722
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:21,245
I just recently
found out about them.

723
00:48:21,346 --> 00:48:26,191
How to describe it?
It's like a membership service

724
00:48:26,768 --> 00:48:33,299
The company provides veteran-grade
help to VIP customers such as you.

725
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:39,305
For example maids, caregivers.
or drivers like myself.

726
00:48:39,406 --> 00:48:42,624
You can tell from the card
they're high-class.

727
00:48:43,159 --> 00:48:44,751
Cool design.

728
00:48:45,829 --> 00:48:47,813
Then how do you
know about this company?

729
00:48:47,914 --> 00:48:52,443
They contacted me
as a veteran-grade driver.

730
00:48:52,544 --> 00:48:54,761
You might say they scouted me?

731
00:48:56,298 --> 00:49:02,036
But when their call came I had
already arranged to meet with you.

732
00:49:02,137 --> 00:49:05,314
I see...

733
00:49:06,349 --> 00:49:09,610
You turned down this
famous company to work for me.

734
00:49:10,145 --> 00:49:11,570
I won't forget that.

735
00:49:13,106 --> 00:49:15,324
Son of a bitch!

736
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:21,222
Anyway, I can give this card
to my wife, right?

737
00:49:21,323 --> 00:49:23,098
Yes, that's why I brought it up.

738
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:25,375
No need to mention me.

739
00:49:26,786 --> 00:49:29,963
You can tell her
you found the company yourself.

740
00:49:30,498 --> 00:49:31,857
Sure.

741
00:49:31,958 --> 00:49:34,318
Thanks to you I can
play the good husband.

742
00:49:34,419 --> 00:49:39,198
On the back, there's
a number for consultations.

743
00:49:39,299 --> 00:49:40,449
Tell her to call there...

744
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:42,100
Eyes on the road!

745
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:50,359
Hello, this is Senior Advisor Yeo
of The Care.

746
00:49:50,518 --> 00:49:53,987
Yes, this is The Care's main office?

747
00:49:54,773 --> 00:49:58,175
If she wanted, she'd be
a fucking great con artist.

748
00:49:58,276 --> 00:50:00,911
Isn't her voice tone great?
Takes after me.

749
00:50:02,447 --> 00:50:04,974
From what I've heard,
it's a full membership service?

750
00:50:05,075 --> 00:50:08,936
So you're not currently
a member, I assume?

751
00:50:09,037 --> 00:50:11,564
That's right,
What steps do I need to take?

752
00:50:11,665 --> 00:50:15,776
We'll just need to receive
a few documents from you.

753
00:50:15,877 --> 00:50:18,863
Are you ready to write this down?

754
00:50:18,964 --> 00:50:23,850
Your family register,
citizenship ID cards...

755
00:50:24,552 --> 00:50:27,496
documents to prove
your income level,

756
00:50:27,597 --> 00:50:30,040
i.e the title to your property, etc.

757
00:50:30,141 --> 00:50:32,567
Our property title?
Yes.

758
00:50:41,111 --> 00:50:42,428
Wow, peaches!

759
00:50:42,529 --> 00:50:44,663
You have some too, Mr. Kevin.

760
00:50:44,781 --> 00:50:46,123
Thank you.

761
00:50:54,624 --> 00:50:57,651
Leave it outside the door
next time.

762
00:50:57,752 --> 00:50:59,886
- And knock!
- Yes.

763
00:51:02,465 --> 00:51:04,074
No entering during my lesson!

764
00:51:04,175 --> 00:51:05,600
Yes, miss!

765
00:51:07,679 --> 00:51:09,079
Park Da-song!

766
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:10,414
Daddy!

767
00:51:10,515 --> 00:51:11,982
Where are you?

768
00:51:16,521 --> 00:51:17,546
Daddy!

769
00:51:17,647 --> 00:51:18,505
Son!

770
00:51:18,606 --> 00:51:21,508
Walkie talkies!

771
00:51:21,609 --> 00:51:22,601
Walkie talkies!

772
00:51:22,702 --> 00:51:25,746
Who do you like better,
your dad or the walkie talkie?

773
00:51:26,081 --> 00:51:29,350
Da-song, how could you
run out from your lesson?

774
00:51:29,451 --> 00:51:33,020
When did you buy all this?

775
00:51:33,121 --> 00:51:34,063
It's no big deal.

776
00:51:34,164 --> 00:51:35,264
Huh?

777
00:51:38,117 --> 00:51:39,348
Huh?

778
00:51:39,859 --> 00:51:41,565
What is it?

779
00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:45,557
What's he doing now?

780
00:51:46,393 --> 00:51:47,785
Da-song, don't do that!

781
00:51:47,886 --> 00:51:51,705
It's the same!
They smell the same!

782
00:51:51,806 --> 00:51:55,417
What are you talking about?
Go up to Jessica.

783
00:51:55,518 --> 00:51:59,571
Jessica smells like that, too.

784
00:52:00,607 --> 00:52:03,926
So do we all need to use
different soap, now?

785
00:52:04,027 --> 00:52:07,888
Dad, we'll need to use
different laundry soap, too.

786
00:52:07,989 --> 00:52:09,098
And fabric softener.

787
00:52:09,199 --> 00:52:13,519
You mean doing four separate
loads of laundry each time?

788
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:15,545
That's not it.

789
00:52:16,164 --> 00:52:18,382
It's the semi-basement smell.

790
00:52:19,417 --> 00:52:22,219
We need to leave this home
to lose the smell.

791
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:29,868
Anyway, aren't we fortunate to be
worrying about things like this?

792
00:52:29,969 --> 00:52:30,995
Sure.

793
00:52:31,096 --> 00:52:34,206
In an age like ours,

794
00:52:34,307 --> 00:52:39,003
when an opening for a security guard
attracts 500 university graduates.

795
00:52:39,104 --> 00:52:42,364
Our entire family got hired!

796
00:52:42,899 --> 00:52:44,533
That's right, Dad!

797
00:52:45,068 --> 00:52:47,511
If we put our 4 salaries together?

798
00:52:47,612 --> 00:52:51,957
The amount of cash coming from
that house into ours is immense!

799
00:52:52,534 --> 00:52:57,062
Let's offer a prayer of gratitude
to the great Mr. Park.

800
00:52:57,163 --> 00:52:58,272
And to Min!

801
00:52:58,373 --> 00:53:01,025
Ki-woo, that friend of yours
turned into such a fine guy,

802
00:53:01,126 --> 00:53:05,429
and thanks to him we're all...
Fuck, not again!

803
00:53:09,993 --> 00:53:10,993
That asshole's dead.

804
00:53:11,094 --> 00:53:13,620
Ki-woo's on the rampage!

805
00:53:13,721 --> 00:53:16,398
Don't overdo it!

806
00:53:17,433 --> 00:53:19,985
Use this instead.

807
00:53:23,523 --> 00:53:25,157
Damn you!

808
00:53:27,694 --> 00:53:28,927
Get a fucking grip!

809
00:53:29,028 --> 00:53:30,954
Get a grip!

810
00:53:32,991 --> 00:53:34,749
Wow!

811
00:53:38,788 --> 00:53:41,214
It's a deluge!

812
00:53:57,682 --> 00:54:01,460
Current weather is clear, over.
The clouds are moving.

813
00:54:01,561 --> 00:54:03,962
But they're not rain clouds, over.

814
00:54:04,063 --> 00:54:05,422
I hear you, over.

815
00:54:05,523 --> 00:54:11,845
Currently your sister's lip
is pouting like a duck's bill.

816
00:54:11,946 --> 00:54:14,932
She's super annoyed, over.

817
00:54:15,033 --> 00:54:19,770
Can't I stay home and study English?
And call Kevin?

818
00:54:19,871 --> 00:54:23,232
Hey! Don't make a scene
just as we're leaving.

819
00:54:23,333 --> 00:54:25,651
If we have to go,
let's have fun.

820
00:54:25,752 --> 00:54:28,403
Da-hye, this is no
ordinary camping trip.

821
00:54:28,504 --> 00:54:29,238
That's right!

822
00:54:29,339 --> 00:54:31,164
How could you miss
your brother's birthday?

823
00:54:31,265 --> 00:54:32,157
No way!

824
00:54:32,258 --> 00:54:34,535
Even your busy father
is taking time off to go.

825
00:54:34,636 --> 00:54:37,562
Right! If you don't go,
you'll regret it!

826
00:54:39,891 --> 00:54:42,042
Oh, right.
You know the beam projector?

827
00:54:42,143 --> 00:54:43,085
The outdoor theater?

828
00:54:43,186 --> 00:54:45,362
Right, bring the outdoor
beam projector.

829
00:54:45,855 --> 00:54:50,342
And look for Da-song's
camping raincoat.

830
00:54:50,443 --> 00:54:52,369
He loves it when it rains.

831
00:54:52,904 --> 00:54:56,598
You remember now?
Zoonie, Berry, and Fofoo.

832
00:54:56,699 --> 00:54:57,766
Zoome and Berry get this.

833
00:54:57,867 --> 00:55:00,686
Yes, Natural Balance Original Ultra.

834
00:55:00,787 --> 00:55:03,255
Right, and for Foofoo...

835
00:55:03,790 --> 00:55:04,982
Kam-kamaboko.
Japanese crab sticks.

836
00:55:05,083 --> 00:55:06,108
Yes.

837
00:55:06,209 --> 00:55:09,152
When you walk Zoonie,
give him a long leash.

838
00:55:09,253 --> 00:55:11,613
He needs to run around
to feel happy.

839
00:55:11,714 --> 00:55:15,141
He's like the canine version
of Da-song!

840
00:55:40,702 --> 00:55:42,477
Son!

841
00:55:42,578 --> 00:55:45,606
Why are you lying down outside?

842
00:55:45,707 --> 00:55:48,591
Isn't he hot out there?

843
00:55:49,127 --> 00:55:53,847
I'm gazing at the sky from home.

844
00:55:55,383 --> 00:55:56,975
It's so great.

845
00:56:00,513 --> 00:56:02,497
Mom, want some water?

846
00:56:02,598 --> 00:56:04,041
There's sparkling, right?

847
00:56:04,142 --> 00:56:06,627
Ki-jung, some water?

848
00:56:06,728 --> 00:56:08,862
Telepathy... thank you.

849
00:56:31,002 --> 00:56:32,594
Whoa.

850
00:56:34,756 --> 00:56:37,766
Wow, all these
varieties or alcohol.

851
00:56:38,885 --> 00:56:42,245
Dad! Let me add
another to the mix!

852
00:56:42,346 --> 00:56:46,858
This is pretty classy.

853
00:56:47,393 --> 00:56:52,547
Rain falling on the lawn,
as we sip our whiskey...

854
00:56:52,648 --> 00:56:57,369
Ki-woo, what's that yellow
notebook you've been carrying?

855
00:56:58,029 --> 00:57:01,473
This? It's Da-hye's diary.

856
00:57:01,574 --> 00:57:03,058
Her diary?

857
00:57:03,159 --> 00:57:07,420
What a scumbag.
How could you read her diary?

858
00:57:07,955 --> 00:57:13,235
Just so we can
understand each other deeper.

859
00:57:13,336 --> 00:57:16,054
Fuck, are you two dating?

860
00:57:16,214 --> 00:57:20,683
I'm serious.
She really likes me too.

861
00:57:22,470 --> 00:57:24,062
Awhile back...

862
00:57:25,098 --> 00:57:26,356
Never mind.

863
00:57:27,391 --> 00:57:30,293
When she enters university.
I'll officially ask her out.

864
00:57:30,394 --> 00:57:31,778
Seriously.

865
00:57:36,359 --> 00:57:38,410
My son!

866
00:57:38,569 --> 00:57:43,164
Then this house will be
your in-laws' house?

867
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:46,560
That's right.

868
00:57:46,661 --> 00:57:50,480
Fuck, then I'm washing dishes
at my daughter-in-law's?

869
00:57:50,581 --> 00:57:54,259
Sure, washing your
daughter-in-law's socks!

870
00:58:05,805 --> 00:58:11,251
I like her.
She's a good kid.

871
00:58:11,352 --> 00:58:15,655
She's pretty,
but she's not wild.

872
00:58:16,691 --> 00:58:20,869
Well, now that
we're daydreaming...

873
00:58:21,946 --> 00:58:24,556
If Da-hye and I marry,

874
00:58:24,657 --> 00:58:28,501
we can bring in actors
to be my mom and dad.

875
00:58:29,479 --> 00:58:30,479
Look at her.

876
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:34,441
She got so many jobs
acting in weddings last year.

877
00:58:34,542 --> 00:58:38,862
even caught the bouquet
from a bitch I've never met.

878
00:58:38,963 --> 00:58:41,948
If you get the bouquet,
they pay an extra $10.

879
00:58:42,049 --> 00:58:44,076
That's how your acting
got so good!

880
00:58:44,177 --> 00:58:49,664
Acting is one thing, but this
family is so gullible, right?

881
00:58:49,765 --> 00:58:51,958
The madame especially.

882
00:58:52,059 --> 00:58:54,068
You said it.

883
00:58:55,605 --> 00:58:59,174
She's so naive,
and nice.

884
00:58:59,275 --> 00:59:01,176
She's rich, but still nice.

885
00:59:01,277 --> 00:59:03,637
Not "rich, but still nice."

886
00:59:03,738 --> 00:59:07,665
"Nice because she's rich."
You know?

887
00:59:08,201 --> 00:59:14,714
Hell, if I had all this money.

888
00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:19,653
I'd be nice too!

889
00:59:19,754 --> 00:59:21,262
Even nicer!

890
00:59:21,422 --> 00:59:23,740
That's true.
Your mom's right

891
00:59:23,841 --> 00:59:26,243
Rich people are naive.
No resentments.

892
00:59:26,344 --> 00:59:28,620
No creases on them.

893
00:59:28,721 --> 00:59:32,124
It all gets ironed out.
Money is an iron.

894
00:59:32,225 --> 00:59:34,626
Those creases all get smoothed out.

895
00:59:34,727 --> 00:59:36,277
Hey, Ki-woo.

896
00:59:36,896 --> 00:59:41,950
You know that driver, Yoon?
Was it Yoon?

897
00:59:42,485 --> 00:59:44,719
The driver before me.

898
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:46,012
Yeah, Yoon.

899
00:59:46,113 --> 00:59:50,684
He must be working
somewhere else now, right?

900
00:59:50,785 --> 00:59:53,103
Sure, he must be.

901
00:59:53,204 --> 00:59:56,798
He's young,
got a nice physique.

902
00:59:57,333 --> 01:00:00,402
He must've found a better job.

903
01:00:00,503 --> 01:00:02,595
Fucking hell!

904
01:00:03,130 --> 01:00:05,615
What's with her now?

905
01:00:05,716 --> 01:00:12,188
We're the ones who need help.
Worry about us, okay?

906
01:00:12,306 --> 01:00:15,709
Dad! Come on, Dad!

907
01:00:15,810 --> 01:00:20,130
Just focus on us, okay?
On us!

908
01:00:20,231 --> 01:00:24,551
Not Driver Yoon, but me, please.

909
01:00:24,652 --> 01:00:26,887
Awesome timing, huh?

910
01:00:26,988 --> 01:00:31,082
She speaks,
and the lightning crashes!

911
01:00:32,743 --> 01:00:35,837
Hey, Jessica. Cheers.

912
01:00:36,872 --> 01:00:42,319
Hey, when I went up before,
and you were in the bath...

913
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:44,345
What about it?

914
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:48,283
How to put it?
You fit in here.

915
01:00:48,384 --> 01:00:51,019
This rich house suits you.
Not like us.

916
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:52,120
Fuck off.

917
01:00:52,221 --> 01:00:53,079
I'm serious!

918
01:00:53,180 --> 01:00:54,831
Dad, before...

919
01:00:54,932 --> 01:00:57,817
She was lying back in the tub,
watching TV.

920
01:00:58,352 --> 01:01:00,903
Like she's lived here for years.

921
01:01:02,481 --> 01:01:08,428
Speaking of which,
if this became our house,

922
01:01:08,529 --> 01:01:12,766
if we lived here,
which room would you want?

923
01:01:12,867 --> 01:01:18,063
What room in this masterwork
by the great Namgoong?

924
01:01:18,164 --> 01:01:20,023
Fuck, I don't know.

925
01:01:20,124 --> 01:01:23,926
Get me the house first.
Then I'll think about it.

926
01:01:24,462 --> 01:01:26,596
We live here now, don't we?

927
01:01:27,131 --> 01:01:30,933
Getting drunk in the living room.

928
01:01:31,052 --> 01:01:33,787
Right, we live here.
Why not?

929
01:01:33,888 --> 01:01:38,541
This is our home right now.
It's cosy.

930
01:01:38,642 --> 01:01:41,628
Cosy?
Are you feeling cosy?

931
01:01:41,729 --> 01:01:46,824
Sure, but suppose Park
walked through that door now.

932
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:48,677
What about your dad?

933
01:01:48,778 --> 01:01:52,413
He'd run and hide
like a cockroach.

934
01:01:52,948 --> 01:01:55,100
Kids, you know at our house,

935
01:01:55,201 --> 01:02:00,939
when you turn on the light,
and the cockroaches scatter?

936
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:02,924
You know what I mean?

937
01:02:03,501 --> 01:02:06,844
I'm getting fucking tired of this.

938
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:09,263
- A cockroach?
- Yeah.

939
01:02:12,802 --> 01:02:14,661
Huh? What's wrong?

940
01:02:14,762 --> 01:02:15,870
What's the matter?

941
01:02:15,971 --> 01:02:19,982
Dad, don't do that.
You only live once.

942
01:02:27,024 --> 01:02:28,717
What the hell?

943
01:02:28,818 --> 01:02:30,427
I fooled you! Didn't I?

944
01:02:30,528 --> 01:02:31,845
Jesus, Dad.

945
01:02:31,946 --> 01:02:36,016
I fooled you too, Ki-woo?
Did it look for real?

946
01:02:36,117 --> 01:02:39,811
If it was for real,
I'd fucking kill you.

947
01:02:39,912 --> 01:02:43,965
What is this?
Fucking puppy.

948
01:02:49,505 --> 01:02:51,740
Who is it at this hour?

949
01:02:51,841 --> 01:02:53,725
What is it?

950
01:02:59,890 --> 01:03:00,999
What's she doing here?

951
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:04,193
The old housekeeper?

952
01:03:04,728 --> 01:03:06,571
What's she here for?

953
01:03:07,106 --> 01:03:10,992
She won't stop ringing it.

954
01:03:12,027 --> 01:03:14,912
Raising a racket.

955
01:03:15,890 --> 01:03:16,890
Who is it?

956
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:21,811
Oh, hello! I'm...

957
01:03:21,912 --> 01:03:23,521
The madame's not in, right?

958
01:03:23,622 --> 01:03:24,522
What?

959
01:03:24,623 --> 01:03:29,218
I worked here
for a very long time.

960
01:03:29,753 --> 01:03:35,283
Above the monitor there,
you see a photo of 3 dogs, right?

961
01:03:35,384 --> 01:03:36,826
Zoome, Berry, Foofoo.

962
01:03:36,927 --> 01:03:41,456
I get it,
but why are you here?

963
01:03:41,557 --> 01:03:46,194
You're my successor
as housekeeper, right?

964
01:03:51,233 --> 01:03:52,992
Anyway...

965
01:03:53,527 --> 01:03:56,805
I'm very sorry to
call on you so late.

966
01:03:56,906 --> 01:03:58,790
It's just that...

967
01:03:59,325 --> 01:04:06,088
I forgot something in the
basement under the kitchen.

968
01:04:06,624 --> 01:04:13,012
When I left,
they pushed me out so quickly...

969
01:04:16,091 --> 01:04:18,267
Would you let me in?

970
01:04:20,304 --> 01:04:22,396
What do we do?

971
01:04:22,932 --> 01:04:25,191
This isn't in the plan.

972
01:04:32,733 --> 01:04:34,450
Sorry for the trouble.

973
01:04:35,010 --> 01:04:36,010
This way.

974
01:04:36,111 --> 01:04:37,745
Yes, thank you.

975
01:04:39,782 --> 01:04:41,724
You can put your raincoat...

976
01:04:41,825 --> 01:04:44,418
It'll just be a second.

977
01:04:44,995 --> 01:04:48,648
Quite a meal there.
That'll be a job to clean up.

978
01:04:48,749 --> 01:04:52,134
But what did you leave below?

979
01:04:56,674 --> 01:04:59,267
Want to come down with me?

980
01:05:00,302 --> 01:05:03,646
Well, just go ahead.

981
01:05:56,734 --> 01:06:00,077
Help me push this!

982
01:06:00,195 --> 01:06:02,680
Pull it! From over there.

983
01:06:02,781 --> 01:06:04,349
What?

984
01:06:04,450 --> 01:06:05,550
Pull!

985
01:06:08,370 --> 01:06:09,921
Pull it hard!

986
01:06:13,459 --> 01:06:14,967
Are you okay?

987
01:06:16,503 --> 01:06:17,803
Did I scare you?

988
01:06:20,341 --> 01:06:21,891
Thank you!

989
01:06:22,968 --> 01:06:24,393
Thank you.

990
01:06:32,378 --> 01:06:33,378
Honey!

991
01:06:33,479 --> 01:06:34,612
What the hell?

992
01:06:36,148 --> 01:06:37,215
Hey!

993
01:06:37,316 --> 01:06:38,866
Honey!

994
01:06:39,902 --> 01:06:41,452
Honey!

995
01:06:43,847 --> 01:06:44,847
Wait!

996
01:06:44,948 --> 01:06:47,141
Honey, I'm here!

997
01:06:47,242 --> 01:06:48,542
What is all this?

998
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:52,180
Honey!

999
01:06:52,456 --> 01:06:54,107
Honey, I'm fine.

1000
01:06:54,208 --> 01:06:55,967
No you're not!

1001
01:06:56,068 --> 01:06:57,068
I'm fine, really.

1002
01:06:57,169 --> 01:06:58,403
How can you say that?

1003
01:06:58,504 --> 01:07:00,280
But I'm really hungry.

1004
01:07:00,381 --> 01:07:01,281
Suck it!

1005
01:07:01,382 --> 01:07:04,617
How many days has it been?

1006
01:07:04,718 --> 01:07:06,435
You must've been so hungry!

1007
01:07:08,472 --> 01:07:09,747
It's okay.

1008
01:07:09,848 --> 01:07:12,542
She's a nice woman.
She let me in

1009
01:07:12,643 --> 01:07:14,752
There was an iron plate,
for grilling meat

1010
01:07:14,853 --> 01:07:16,296
It was wedged under the shelf.

1011
01:07:16,397 --> 01:07:17,463
So that's why.

1012
01:07:17,564 --> 01:07:20,967
I couldn't open it from the inside.

1013
01:07:21,068 --> 01:07:24,578
- What's going on here?
- I know you must be startled.

1014
01:07:24,697 --> 01:07:27,289
I would be too in this situation.

1015
01:07:27,408 --> 01:07:31,936
But as two fellow workers...
Right, Chung-sook?

1016
01:07:32,037 --> 01:07:34,880
How do you know my name?

1017
01:07:35,416 --> 01:07:40,111
To be honest I'm still texting
with the boy Da-song.

1018
01:07:40,212 --> 01:07:44,782
I knew they were going camping,
so I came today.

1019
01:07:44,883 --> 01:07:47,660
I wanted to speak to you alone.

1020
01:07:47,761 --> 01:07:48,936
Talking about.

1021
01:07:51,473 --> 01:07:53,791
Don't worry, Chung-sook.

1022
01:07:53,892 --> 01:07:57,629
I cut the wire
on the CCTV by the gate.

1023
01:07:57,730 --> 01:08:01,341
Nobody knows I came.
Isn't that good, sis?

1024
01:08:01,442 --> 01:08:03,509
Don't call me sis!

1025
01:08:03,610 --> 01:08:06,579
Sis, my name is Moon-gwang.

1026
01:08:07,114 --> 01:08:11,184
This is my hubbie Oh Geun-sae.
Say hello, honey.

1027
01:08:11,285 --> 01:08:14,604
This tastes great.
What happened to your face?

1028
01:08:14,705 --> 01:08:17,548
I'll tell you later.

1029
01:08:18,125 --> 01:08:22,028
So you'd steal food every day
while working in the kitchen.

1030
01:08:22,129 --> 01:08:23,154
Feeding your husband.

1031
01:08:23,255 --> 01:08:27,909
Not at all! I bought
all his food with my salary.

1032
01:08:28,010 --> 01:08:31,079
That's so unfair!

1033
01:08:31,180 --> 01:08:33,790
But how long has
your husband been down here?

1034
01:08:33,891 --> 01:08:36,734
Hold on a sec.
4 years?

1035
01:08:37,269 --> 01:08:39,921
4 years, 3 months
and 17 days.

1036
01:08:40,022 --> 01:08:41,989
Right, it's June now.

1037
01:08:42,524 --> 01:08:48,412
Four years ago when
Mr. Namgoong moved to Paris,

1038
01:08:48,572 --> 01:08:51,582
in the time before
Mr. Park's family moved in,

1039
01:08:51,742 --> 01:08:55,186
I brought my husband down here.

1040
01:08:55,287 --> 01:09:00,316
Many rich houses have secret bunkers,
where you can hide

1041
01:09:00,417 --> 01:09:04,946
in case North Korea attacks,
or if creditors break in.

1042
01:09:05,047 --> 01:09:11,227
But it seems Mr. Namgoong was
a bit embarrassed about this,

1043
01:09:11,386 --> 01:09:15,248
because he never mentioned it
to Mr. Park's family.

1044
01:09:15,349 --> 01:09:16,666
So only I know about it.

1045
01:09:16,767 --> 01:09:19,252
So that’s how it happened.

1046
01:09:19,353 --> 01:09:23,464
But now that I know, I've no
choice but to call the police!

1047
01:09:23,565 --> 01:09:25,991
No please, sis!

1048
01:09:26,610 --> 01:09:28,886
As fellow members
of the needy, please don't.

1049
01:09:28,987 --> 01:09:30,388
I'm not needy!

1050
01:09:30,489 --> 01:09:34,267
But we're needy!

1051
01:09:34,368 --> 01:09:38,855
We've no house, no money,
only debts!

1052
01:09:38,956 --> 01:09:40,106
Sis, please!

1053
01:09:40,207 --> 01:09:44,652
Even after 4 years of hiding,
those debt collectors won't give up.

1054
01:09:44,753 --> 01:09:48,906
They're still searching for him,
threatening to stab him.

1055
01:09:49,007 --> 01:09:50,808
You used loan sharks?

1056
01:09:51,468 --> 01:09:53,686
It's all my fault.

1057
01:09:54,221 --> 01:09:55,521
The Taiwan cake shop.

1058
01:09:56,056 --> 01:09:59,834
My Taiwanese Wangshui
castella shop went bust.

1059
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:02,211
I was overwhelmed by debt.

1060
01:10:02,312 --> 01:10:04,071
Please take this.

1061
01:10:04,189 --> 01:10:05,573
What's that?

1062
01:10:06,108 --> 01:10:09,969
It's not much,
just a modest sum.

1063
01:10:10,070 --> 01:10:13,056
But we'll send it
to you every month.

1064
01:10:13,157 --> 01:10:14,891
In return,
just once every 2 days.

1065
01:10:14,992 --> 01:10:18,461
please leave him some food.

1066
01:10:18,996 --> 01:10:22,006
No no, just once a week.

1067
01:10:22,541 --> 01:10:24,734
There's a refrigerator here.
Just once a week.

1068
01:10:24,835 --> 01:10:27,278
You've got some nerve!
I'm calling the police.

1069
01:10:27,379 --> 01:10:28,596
Sis!

1070
01:10:31,633 --> 01:10:32,850
Who is that?

1071
01:10:35,888 --> 01:10:37,771
Wait... Jessica?

1072
01:10:38,307 --> 01:10:39,332
Mr. Kim?

1073
01:10:39,433 --> 01:10:40,533
What the hell?

1074
01:10:42,019 --> 01:10:43,086
Dad, my ankle!

1075
01:10:43,187 --> 01:10:44,378
You okay? Sorry.

1076
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:46,380
Dad, my foot.

1077
01:10:46,481 --> 01:10:48,157
Don't call me Dad!

1078
01:10:55,699 --> 01:10:59,502
I thought it was weird
when the driver was fired.

1079
01:10:59,728 --> 01:11:00,728
Hey.

1080
01:11:00,829 --> 01:11:03,272
- Let's talk things over.
- What the hell?

1081
01:11:03,373 --> 01:11:04,732
Are you some
family of charlatans?

1082
01:11:04,833 --> 01:11:05,650
So, sis...

1083
01:11:05,751 --> 01:11:08,260
Don't fucking call me sis,
you filthy bitch!

1084
01:11:08,795 --> 01:11:13,574
I'm gonna send this video
to the madame, how about that?

1085
01:11:13,675 --> 01:11:15,868
Dad, my foot.

1086
01:11:15,969 --> 01:11:18,187
No reception in
the basement, right?

1087
01:11:18,722 --> 01:11:20,581
- The phone works fine.
- Fuck.

1088
01:11:20,682 --> 01:11:25,294
Ma'am, to be honest,
the jobs we have here...

1089
01:11:25,395 --> 01:11:28,422
Shut up!
It's too late now!

1090
01:11:28,523 --> 01:11:31,759
Let's all go to jail!
We're fucking going down!

1091
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:35,371
Lady, are you crazy?

1092
01:11:35,906 --> 01:11:40,893
If they see that video, Mr. Park
and his wife will be so shocked!

1093
01:11:40,994 --> 01:11:44,380
What did those nice people
ever do wrong?

1094
01:11:44,731 --> 01:11:45,731
Why do this to them?

1095
01:11:45,832 --> 01:11:47,525
Stop right there!

1096
01:11:47,626 --> 01:11:49,986
Or I'll push the 'send' button.

1097
01:11:50,087 --> 01:11:52,054
Follow me.

1098
01:11:52,589 --> 01:11:55,015
Calm down, ma'am.

1099
01:11:58,553 --> 01:12:00,604
Don't push!

1100
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:03,148
Let's go up, honey.

1101
01:12:03,684 --> 01:12:06,569
Time for you
to get some fresh air!

1102
01:12:23,620 --> 01:12:29,925
Honey, this 'send' button
is like a missile launcher.

1103
01:12:30,085 --> 01:12:31,844
What do you mean, honey?

1104
01:12:32,421 --> 01:12:37,700
If we threaten to push it,
those people can't do anything.

1105
01:12:37,801 --> 01:12:42,313
It's like a North Korean rocket.
A North Korean missile button!

1106
01:12:43,849 --> 01:12:47,293
Today our beloved
Great Leader Kim Jong-un,

1107
01:12:47,394 --> 01:12:50,463
after witnessing the
charlatan family video,

1108
01:12:50,564 --> 01:12:53,299
was unable to contain
his shock and fury

1109
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:56,636
at their wicked,
despicable provocation!

1110
01:12:56,737 --> 01:12:58,512
I've missed your jokes, honey!

1111
01:12:58,613 --> 01:13:03,142
Therefore our Great Leader,
in this age of denuclearization,

1112
01:13:03,243 --> 01:13:09,023
has commanded that the nation's
last remaining nuclear warhead

1113
01:13:09,124 --> 01:13:11,609
be driven down the throats
of this wicked family!

1114
01:13:11,710 --> 01:13:16,405
No one can imitate North Korean
news anchors like you!

1115
01:13:16,506 --> 01:13:21,535
With their stinking guts serving
as the last nuclear graveyard,

1116
01:13:21,636 --> 01:13:26,540
our Dear Leaders wish to denuclearize
and bring world peace can...

1117
01:13:26,641 --> 01:13:28,651
Hands in the air, fuckers!

1118
01:13:29,186 --> 01:13:30,319
Higher!

1119
01:13:32,230 --> 01:13:34,257
You scumbag family.

1120
01:13:34,358 --> 01:13:35,432
Husband?

1121
01:13:35,533 --> 01:13:36,342
Husband.

1122
01:13:36,443 --> 01:13:37,226
Wife?

1123
01:13:37,327 --> 01:13:38,177
Yes.

1124
01:13:38,278 --> 01:13:39,278
Son?

1125
01:13:39,379 --> 01:13:40,145
Yes.

1126
01:13:40,246 --> 01:13:41,305
- Daughter?
- Daughter.

1127
01:13:41,406 --> 01:13:43,349
You neanderthals.

1128
01:13:43,450 --> 01:13:47,812
Is that all you can think to do,
drink yourselves stupid?

1129
01:13:47,913 --> 01:13:53,192
In this home suffused with
Mr. Namgoong's creative spirit?

1130
01:13:53,293 --> 01:13:54,318
You cretins!

1131
01:13:54,419 --> 01:13:55,736
What do you know about art?

1132
01:13:55,837 --> 01:13:58,097
What would they know?

1133
01:13:58,757 --> 01:14:06,680
When the sun was nice,
we'd bask in those sunbeam, right?

1134
01:14:07,516 --> 01:14:12,152
At such moments we could feel
his artistic touch.

1135
01:15:00,026 --> 01:15:03,537
Give it to me!

1136
01:15:22,591 --> 01:15:26,101
Good job! Delete it!

1137
01:15:27,137 --> 01:15:29,730
Careful, don't send it
by accident.

1138
01:15:44,279 --> 01:15:45,379
Hello?

1139
01:15:45,906 --> 01:15:49,416
Listen, do you know how
to make ram-don?

1140
01:15:49,951 --> 01:15:51,185
Ram-don?

1141
01:15:51,286 --> 01:15:54,963
Da-song likes ram-don
more than anything.

1142
01:15:55,123 --> 01:15:58,818
If you boil the water now,
the timing will be perfect.

1143
01:15:58,919 --> 01:16:01,654
There's sirloin in the fridge,
add that too.

1144
01:16:01,755 --> 01:16:03,280
Then, the camping...?

1145
01:16:03,381 --> 01:16:07,100
My god, what a disaster.

1146
01:16:07,636 --> 01:16:12,898
The river overflowed and
everyone was packing their tents,

1147
01:16:13,016 --> 01:16:16,043
but Da-song was crying and
refusing to go home.

1148
01:16:16,144 --> 01:16:20,280
Anyway, ram-don
as soon as we walk in, okay?

1149
01:16:20,398 --> 01:16:22,883
Then you're almost here?

1150
01:16:22,984 --> 01:16:25,536
8 minutes,
according to the GPS.

1151
01:16:25,929 --> 01:16:26,929
You arrive in 8 minutes...

1152
01:16:27,030 --> 01:16:30,749
Start boiling
the water right away!

1153
01:16:34,788 --> 01:16:36,505
What the hell is ram-don?

1154
01:16:45,549 --> 01:16:47,349
Move, quickly!

1155
01:16:49,135 --> 01:16:50,235
Hurry!

1156
01:16:57,102 --> 01:16:59,069
Ramen / Udon

1157
01:17:00,605 --> 01:17:03,657
Dad, I can't drag her
any further!

1158
01:17:14,703 --> 01:17:16,587
What are you doing?

1159
01:17:17,706 --> 01:17:19,548
Dad!

1160
01:17:22,586 --> 01:17:25,804
Go up quickly!
Help upstairs.

1161
01:17:33,346 --> 01:17:34,446
Take this!

1162
01:17:53,783 --> 01:17:54,975
Welcome home!

1163
01:17:55,076 --> 01:17:58,420
Da-song, look!
Let's eat ram-don!

1164
01:18:00,582 --> 01:18:02,090
Da-song!

1165
01:18:04,711 --> 01:18:06,720
Da-song!

1166
01:18:13,261 --> 01:18:14,645
Madame!

1167
01:18:33,239 --> 01:18:35,099
Why don't you just
eat the ram-don?

1168
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:35,975
Shall I?

1169
01:18:36,076 --> 01:18:39,144
No, wait.
I can give it to my husband.

1170
01:18:39,245 --> 01:18:41,338
There's sirloin in here.

1171
01:18:43,875 --> 01:18:47,636
It's cooked through?
Medium well done.

1172
01:19:12,696 --> 01:19:18,601
Returning after a day's work...
I love you so much, Mr. Park!

1173
01:19:18,702 --> 01:19:25,215
Home from the office,
Mr. Park is off duty now.

1174
01:19:26,876 --> 01:19:31,155
Returning after a day's work...
I love you so much, Mr. Park!

1175
01:19:31,256 --> 01:19:33,348
- What are you doing?
- Shut up!

1176
01:19:44,894 --> 01:19:47,296
Honey, do you want
some ram-don?

1177
01:19:47,397 --> 01:19:48,422
Da-song doesn't want it?

1178
01:19:48,523 --> 01:19:49,173
No.

1179
01:19:49,274 --> 01:19:51,199
No, I'm tired.
I'm going to bed.

1180
01:19:51,735 --> 01:19:54,494
Why are you staring?

1181
01:19:55,530 --> 01:19:59,016
Mr. Park, you feed me
and house me.

1182
01:19:59,117 --> 01:20:00,625
Respect!

1183
01:20:02,662 --> 01:20:04,337
You do this every day?

1184
01:20:04,873 --> 01:20:10,343
Sure, I even send whole
sentences to thank him.

1185
01:20:10,879 --> 01:20:12,988
Someone of your age
should know it.

1186
01:20:13,089 --> 01:20:13,947
Know what?

1187
01:20:14,048 --> 01:20:15,849
Morse Code.

1188
01:20:16,426 --> 01:20:20,437
That sensor's going batty.

1189
01:20:28,605 --> 01:20:32,132
Da-song will know it,
since he's a Scout.

1190
01:20:32,233 --> 01:20:33,926
It's ridiculous, right?

1191
01:20:34,027 --> 01:20:37,513
Running around.
trying to please a kid.

1192
01:20:37,614 --> 01:20:39,598
He's not some kind of prince.

1193
01:20:39,699 --> 01:20:42,459
He's the youngest.
It's common.

1194
01:20:43,495 --> 01:20:45,003
Please understand.

1195
01:20:45,538 --> 01:20:49,299
Da-song's a bit... unwell.

1196
01:20:49,542 --> 01:20:52,594
He's receiving trauma therapy
and art therapy.

1197
01:20:53,505 --> 01:20:55,531
There was an incident.

1198
01:20:55,632 --> 01:20:57,015
What incident?

1199
01:20:57,300 --> 01:21:01,228
Sis, you believe in ghosts, too?

1200
01:21:02,347 --> 01:21:06,274
Da-song saw a ghost in the house
when he was in 1st grade.

1201
01:21:12,816 --> 01:21:15,217
He had a birthday party
at home that day.

1202
01:21:15,318 --> 01:21:17,761
Late that night,
when everyone was sleeping,

1203
01:21:17,862 --> 01:21:22,433
Da-song crept down to the kitchen
and took the cake out.

1204
01:21:22,534 --> 01:21:25,602
The whipped cream
on that cake was amazing.

1205
01:21:25,703 --> 01:21:28,630
Even in bed, he couldn't
stop thinking about it.

1206
01:21:29,165 --> 01:21:34,553
So Da-song was sitting,
eating his cake...

1207
01:21:44,097 --> 01:21:47,065
He screamed,
and I ran downstairs,

1208
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:49,568
and he was all...

1209
01:21:50,103 --> 01:21:55,448
his eyes rolled back in his head,
convulsions, foam in his mouth.

1210
01:21:57,485 --> 01:21:59,720
Have you ever seen a child
have a seizure?

1211
01:21:59,821 --> 01:22:00,554
No.

1212
01:22:00,655 --> 01:22:05,934
They need 15-minute treatment,
or they're done for.

1213
01:22:06,035 --> 01:22:11,214
That's the time you have to reach
an emergency room, 15 minutes.

1214
01:22:12,750 --> 01:22:16,987
How can you live
in a place like this?

1215
01:22:17,088 --> 01:22:20,282
Well, lots of people
live underground.

1216
01:22:20,383 --> 01:22:22,284
Especially if you count
semi-basements.

1217
01:22:22,385 --> 01:22:26,980
What'll you do?
You don't have a plan?

1218
01:22:27,140 --> 01:22:30,775
I just feel comfortable here.

1219
01:22:31,853 --> 01:22:35,071
It feels like I was born here.

1220
01:22:35,732 --> 01:22:39,009
Maybe I had
my wedding here, too.

1221
01:22:39,110 --> 01:22:42,537
As for the National Pension,
I don't qualify.

1222
01:22:43,656 --> 01:22:47,292
In my old age,
love will comfort me.

1223
01:22:48,828 --> 01:22:54,216
So please.
Let me live down here.

1224
01:22:55,752 --> 01:22:57,469
Anyway...

1225
01:22:58,004 --> 01:23:03,058
My husband was away on business,
so I had to deal with it all.

1226
01:23:03,676 --> 01:23:07,996
Since then we've always
gone out for his birthday.

1227
01:23:08,097 --> 01:23:11,124
Last year my mother's house,
this year, camping.

1228
01:23:11,225 --> 01:23:16,088
Da-song's dad says it's
just a part of growing up.

1229
01:23:16,189 --> 01:23:21,034
They say a ghost in the
house brings wealth.

1230
01:23:22,195 --> 01:23:27,207
Actually, the money's
been good recently.

1231
01:23:53,768 --> 01:23:55,819
Thank god.

1232
01:24:22,380 --> 01:24:25,307
Just stay here for now.

1233
01:24:35,893 --> 01:24:37,944
Zoonie, what's wrong?

1234
01:24:39,981 --> 01:24:41,489
Something under there?

1235
01:24:43,067 --> 01:24:44,826
What is it?

1236
01:24:45,862 --> 01:24:47,078
Damn it!

1237
01:24:48,614 --> 01:24:49,640
- Mom!
- Yeah?

1238
01:24:49,741 --> 01:24:52,142
- How could you?
- What?

1239
01:24:52,243 --> 01:24:56,363
I like ram-don too!
How could you not even ask me?

1240
01:24:56,464 --> 01:24:57,189
Well...

1241
01:24:57,290 --> 01:25:01,360
Da-song didn't want it, so you
asked Dad, then ate it yourself.

1242
01:25:01,461 --> 01:25:02,277
Want her to make one?

1243
01:25:02,378 --> 01:25:04,279
That's not the point!

1244
01:25:04,380 --> 01:25:08,075
- Stop fighting over ramen!
- Why didn't you ask me?

1245
01:25:08,176 --> 01:25:11,686
Oh, stop it! Just go to bed
Go get changed.

1246
01:25:15,266 --> 01:25:16,858
This way!

1247
01:25:19,353 --> 01:25:22,614
Under there! Hurry!

1248
01:25:25,777 --> 01:25:28,095
One, two, three! One two three!

1249
01:25:28,196 --> 01:25:29,638
Da-song?

1250
01:25:29,739 --> 01:25:32,457
Da-song, cut it out!

1251
01:25:32,992 --> 01:25:35,460
He's gone crazy!
Get an umbrella.

1252
01:25:35,620 --> 01:25:37,128
Hey Park Da-song!

1253
01:25:38,664 --> 01:25:43,443
What a monster.
What the hell is he doing?

1254
01:25:43,544 --> 01:25:47,322
Da-song, it’s time for bed!
You know how late it is?

1255
01:25:47,423 --> 01:25:48,523
Here.

1256
01:25:49,467 --> 01:25:50,767
Honey, here.

1257
01:25:54,347 --> 01:26:01,027
Who do you take after to be
so stubborn! Look at this rain!

1258
01:26:06,567 --> 01:26:09,411
OMG Kevin.
Da-song camping in the yard.

1259
01:26:12,990 --> 01:26:17,419
Hey, channel 3 for emergencies!
Keep it turned on.

1260
01:26:17,995 --> 01:26:21,189
Let me have it.
I can't believe him

1261
01:26:21,290 --> 01:26:23,925
Just leave him.
He'll come in if he's tired.

1262
01:26:24,460 --> 01:26:27,120
- I want you here, honey.
- I'm with you.

1263
01:26:27,221 --> 01:26:28,196
Hey, Da-hye!

1264
01:26:28,297 --> 01:26:30,890
Stop using your phone.
Go to bed.

1265
01:26:31,425 --> 01:26:33,869
Go sleep in your room.
We'll take care of things.

1266
01:26:33,970 --> 01:26:36,997
This is the living room,
do you copy?

1267
01:26:37,098 --> 01:26:38,206
Copy, over.

1268
01:26:38,307 --> 01:26:42,502
Daddy is standing by
for emergencies, over.

1269
01:26:42,603 --> 01:26:45,363
Got it, over.

1270
01:26:46,399 --> 01:26:48,341
Is that tent going to leak?

1271
01:26:48,442 --> 01:26:51,762
We ordered from the U.S.,
it'll be fine.

1272
01:26:51,863 --> 01:26:54,890
- Should we sleep here?
- What?

1273
01:26:54,991 --> 01:26:57,184
We've got a full view of the tent.

1274
01:26:57,285 --> 01:26:59,144
Good idea.
I'll feel much better.

1275
01:26:59,245 --> 01:26:59,978
Right?

1276
01:27:00,079 --> 01:27:02,088
Let’s watch over him as we sleep.

1277
01:27:04,125 --> 01:27:05,550
What a kid...

1278
01:27:15,094 --> 01:27:16,311
Wait a minute.

1279
01:27:18,890 --> 01:27:20,874
Where's that smell coming from?

1280
01:27:20,975 --> 01:27:22,400
What smell?

1281
01:27:22,935 --> 01:27:24,277
Mr. Kim's smell.

1282
01:27:24,812 --> 01:27:26,196
- Mr. Kim?
- Yeah.

1283
01:27:26,814 --> 01:27:28,173
Not sure what you mean.

1284
01:27:28,274 --> 01:27:31,451
Really?
You must have smelled it.

1285
01:27:31,986 --> 01:27:35,555
That smell that wafts through
the car, how to describe it?

1286
01:27:35,656 --> 01:27:38,016
- An old man's smell?
- No no, it's not that

1287
01:27:38,117 --> 01:27:40,376
What is it?

1288
01:27:40,912 --> 01:27:42,795
Like an old radish?

1289
01:27:43,414 --> 01:27:44,631
No.

1290
01:27:44,749 --> 01:27:46,983
You know when you boil a rag?

1291
01:27:47,084 --> 01:27:48,468
It smells like that.

1292
01:27:51,005 --> 01:27:57,369
Anyway, even though he always
seems about to cross the line,

1293
01:27:57,470 --> 01:28:00,705
he never does cross it.
That's good.

1294
01:28:00,806 --> 01:28:02,440
- I'll give him credit.
- Yeah.

1295
01:28:03,559 --> 01:28:06,319
But that smell crosses the line.

1296
01:28:06,854 --> 01:28:09,072
It powers through
right into the back seat.

1297
01:28:09,190 --> 01:28:10,966
How bad can it be?

1298
01:28:11,067 --> 01:28:12,283
I don't know.

1299
01:28:13,319 --> 01:28:15,703
It's hard to describe.

1300
01:28:16,739 --> 01:28:20,183
But you sometimes smell it
on the subway.

1301
01:28:20,284 --> 01:28:23,711
It's been ages
since I rode a subway.

1302
01:28:24,247 --> 01:28:27,190
People who ride the subway
have a special smell.

1303
01:28:27,291 --> 01:28:28,716
Yeah.

1304
01:28:44,850 --> 01:28:47,902
Isn't this like
the cars back seat?

1305
01:28:48,562 --> 01:28:52,031
What if Da-song comes back in?

1306
01:28:52,566 --> 01:28:54,200
Don't worry!

1307
01:28:54,735 --> 01:28:57,412
I can just pull my hand back.

1308
01:29:02,952 --> 01:29:04,586
We shouldn't...

1309
01:29:11,127 --> 01:29:12,510
Do it clockwise.

1310
01:29:13,045 --> 01:29:14,145
Right.

1311
01:29:17,508 --> 01:29:20,810
You know where.

1312
01:29:37,361 --> 01:29:40,872
You still have those cheap panties?

1313
01:29:41,052 --> 01:29:42,152
Huh?

1314
01:29:42,408 --> 01:29:45,168
The ones Yoon's girlfriend
left behind.

1315
01:29:46,287 --> 01:29:49,380
If you wear those,
I'll get really fucking hard.

1316
01:29:49,915 --> 01:29:51,257
Really?

1317
01:29:51,792 --> 01:29:54,802
Then buy me drugs.

1318
01:29:55,379 --> 01:29:58,973
Buy me drugs!

1319
01:30:00,051 --> 01:30:01,517
Eat this instead.

1320
01:30:13,564 --> 01:30:14,697
You like it?

1321
01:30:35,836 --> 01:30:38,221
They're passed out cold.
Sneak out now.

1322
01:31:12,289 --> 01:31:14,716
Emergency!
Emergency, over!

1323
01:31:17,253 --> 01:31:18,636
- Emergency!
- What?

1324
01:31:19,655 --> 01:31:20,655
What is it, over!

1325
01:31:20,756 --> 01:31:22,324
Da-song, what's wrong?

1326
01:31:22,425 --> 01:31:24,892
I can't sleep, over.

1327
01:31:25,010 --> 01:31:28,913
So stop it and come in, okay?

1328
01:31:29,014 --> 01:31:31,666
Go sleep in your soft bed. over

1329
01:31:31,767 --> 01:31:33,084
Right!

1330
01:31:33,185 --> 01:31:35,528
I don't want to. over.

1331
01:31:36,063 --> 01:31:37,488
Hey, Park Da-song.

1332
01:31:42,653 --> 01:31:44,996
Let's just sleep...

1333
01:33:19,750 --> 01:33:23,511
How did it turn out back there?

1334
01:33:24,547 --> 01:33:25,647
What?

1335
01:33:27,967 --> 01:33:30,017
The people in the basement.

1336
01:33:32,680 --> 01:33:37,108
Well, I tied them up.

1337
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:39,569
What will we do now?

1338
01:33:40,688 --> 01:33:41,863
Huh?

1339
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:47,577
What do we do now,
what's our plan?

1340
01:33:48,195 --> 01:33:51,289
I've been wondering...

1341
01:33:52,032 --> 01:33:55,418
What would Min do
in this situation?

1342
01:33:56,954 --> 01:33:59,297
Min wouldn't be
in this situation!

1343
01:34:01,333 --> 01:34:07,013
Look kids, we made it
out of there safely, right?

1344
01:34:08,090 --> 01:34:13,453
And besides us, nobody knows
what happened there. Right?

1345
01:34:13,554 --> 01:34:16,480
So nothing happened.
You understand?

1346
01:34:17,558 --> 01:34:22,153
I've got my own plan.

1347
01:34:22,688 --> 01:34:26,407
So you two just
forget about it, okay?

1348
01:34:26,942 --> 01:34:28,492
Let's go home.

1349
01:34:29,528 --> 01:34:31,579
Let's go take a bath.

1350
01:34:50,215 --> 01:34:52,725
What are you doing there?
Hurry up!

1351
01:35:06,273 --> 01:35:08,532
What's going on?

1352
01:35:10,653 --> 01:35:13,388
You stay there.
This is all sewage water.

1353
01:35:13,489 --> 01:35:15,915
Was our window open?

1354
01:35:20,454 --> 01:35:23,381
Help me out, Ki-taek!

1355
01:35:31,590 --> 01:35:33,015
Ki-woo!

1356
01:35:35,552 --> 01:35:38,521
Hey Ki-woo,
close the window!

1357
01:35:39,556 --> 01:35:41,732
You got shocked?

1358
01:35:48,357 --> 01:35:50,074
I'm dizzy.

1359
01:35:53,654 --> 01:35:57,707
Hold on a sec.
Wait.

1360
01:36:03,247 --> 01:36:05,047
Shit, I'm dizzy.

1361
01:36:09,086 --> 01:36:11,637
Ki-jung, be careful.

1362
01:36:13,173 --> 01:36:14,724
Don't touch anything.

1363
01:36:27,271 --> 01:36:32,925
Honey, I've got a concussion.

1364
01:36:33,026 --> 01:36:35,870
I can't see you.

1365
01:36:56,967 --> 01:37:01,729
Honey, that woman Chung-sook...

1366
01:37:02,264 --> 01:37:04,165
Oh, god.

1367
01:37:04,266 --> 01:37:06,609
What a nice person.

1368
01:37:08,187 --> 01:37:11,614
She kicked me
down the stairs

1369
01:37:14,151 --> 01:37:16,202
Repeat after me.

1370
01:37:16,737 --> 01:37:19,455
Chung-sook...

1371
01:37:20,991 --> 01:37:24,418
Chung-sook...

1372
01:37:33,337 --> 01:37:35,638
Hey, Ki-woo!

1373
01:37:36,423 --> 01:37:38,032
What at are you doing there?

1374
01:37:38,133 --> 01:37:39,233
Huh?

1375
01:37:54,233 --> 01:37:58,369
H O L P... M...

1376
01:39:03,677 --> 01:39:04,894
Dad.

1377
01:39:05,554 --> 01:39:06,854
Yeah?

1378
01:39:07,890 --> 01:39:11,609
What was your plan?

1379
01:39:13,186 --> 01:39:15,196
What are you talking about?

1380
01:39:16,231 --> 01:39:18,949
Before, you said you had a plan.

1381
01:39:19,484 --> 01:39:21,452
What will you do?
About...

1382
01:39:22,029 --> 01:39:23,287
the basement.

1383
01:39:24,323 --> 01:39:30,044
Ki-woo, you know what kind
of plan never fails?

1384
01:39:31,622 --> 01:39:34,148
No plan at all.

1385
01:39:34,249 --> 01:39:35,925
No plan.

1386
01:39:36,460 --> 01:39:38,010
You know why?

1387
01:39:40,047 --> 01:39:46,727
If you make a plan,
life never works out that way.

1388
01:39:47,262 --> 01:39:48,771
Look around us.

1389
01:39:49,306 --> 01:39:54,944
Did these people think,
"Let's all spend the night in a gym?"

1390
01:39:55,479 --> 01:39:57,446
But look now.

1391
01:39:57,606 --> 01:40:01,617
Everyone's sleeping
on the floor, us included.

1392
01:40:03,153 --> 01:40:06,580
That's why people
shouldn't make plans.

1393
01:40:08,617 --> 01:40:12,395
With no plan,
nothing can go wrong.

1394
01:40:12,496 --> 01:40:19,385
And if something spins out
of control, it doesn't matter.

1395
01:40:20,420 --> 01:40:23,389
Whether you kill someone
or betray your country.

1396
01:40:24,925 --> 01:40:28,560
None of it fucking matters.
Got it?

1397
01:40:30,222 --> 01:40:31,689
Dad.

1398
01:40:33,725 --> 01:40:35,317
I'm sorry.

1399
01:40:35,936 --> 01:40:37,778
For what?

1400
01:40:40,816 --> 01:40:42,449
Everything.

1401
01:40:43,110 --> 01:40:44,910
All of it.

1402
01:40:46,947 --> 01:40:49,248
I'll take care of everything.

1403
01:40:49,783 --> 01:40:52,001
What are you talking about?

1404
01:40:54,037 --> 01:40:56,630
Why are you hugging
that stone?

1405
01:40:57,249 --> 01:40:58,966
This?

1406
01:41:04,506 --> 01:41:07,641
It keeps clinging to me.

1407
01:41:09,678 --> 01:41:14,064
I think you need some sleep.

1408
01:41:17,102 --> 01:41:18,694
I'm serious.

1409
01:41:20,230 --> 01:41:22,823
It keeps following me.

1410
01:41:35,871 --> 01:41:37,730
Miss Jessica!
Sorry to call on Sunday morning.

1411
01:41:37,831 --> 01:41:40,191
Are you free for lunch today?

1412
01:41:40,292 --> 01:41:44,053
We're having a birthday
impromptu for Da-song.

1413
01:41:45,630 --> 01:41:47,365
A birthday party?

1414
01:41:47,466 --> 01:41:50,893
If you come too,
Da-song will be so happy.

1415
01:41:51,094 --> 01:41:55,230
And have as much pasta, gratin,
and salmon steak as you want.

1416
01:41:55,348 --> 01:41:57,458
Please come by 1PM,

1417
01:41:57,559 --> 01:42:00,670
and I'll count today as
one of your lessons.

1418
01:42:00,771 --> 01:42:03,322
You know what I mean?
See you soon!

1419
01:42:04,566 --> 01:42:06,008
- Mom.
- Yeah?

1420
01:42:06,109 --> 01:42:09,762
For the impromptu,
should we invite Kevin too?

1421
01:42:09,863 --> 01:42:12,640
Great idea! Why not?
Will you call him?

1422
01:42:12,741 --> 01:42:16,644
Get some more sleep, honey!
You must be tired after yesterday.

1423
01:42:16,745 --> 01:42:20,898
If we have a party,
won't you need to do the rounds?

1424
01:42:20,999 --> 01:42:25,386
Right, the wine shop,
supermarket, bakery, florist...

1425
01:42:26,213 --> 01:42:28,847
But I already told Mr. Kim
to hurry over.

1426
01:42:28,965 --> 01:42:30,658
I'll pay him overtime.

1427
01:42:30,759 --> 01:42:31,859
Perfect.

1428
01:42:42,395 --> 01:42:46,073
Everyone sit down, I'll explain!

1429
01:42:46,316 --> 01:42:51,995
Da-hye: We're having a party,
and mom said to invite you!

1430
01:42:53,949 --> 01:42:57,268
Sis, in the basement...

1431
01:42:57,369 --> 01:42:59,645
we have 10 outdoor tables.

1432
01:42:59,746 --> 01:43:03,632
First take them all out,
then arrange them...

1433
01:43:04,292 --> 01:43:07,511
No, come to the window.
I need to show you.

1434
01:43:09,214 --> 01:43:10,990
With Da-song's tent in the middle,

1435
01:43:11,091 --> 01:43:14,626
curve the tables outward...

1436
01:43:14,727 --> 01:43:16,871
A crane's wing formation!

1437
01:43:16,972 --> 01:43:20,257
Like Admiral Yi used, you know?
The Battle of Hansan Island!

1438
01:43:20,358 --> 01:43:22,918
Think of the tent as
the Japanese warship.

1439
01:43:23,019 --> 01:43:28,299
And our tables will make a
semicircular crane's wing formation.

1440
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:32,595
Then near the tent will be the
barbeque grill, firewood and such.

1441
01:43:32,696 --> 01:43:34,897
Arrange them all there!

1442
01:43:34,998 --> 01:43:38,859
Oh sure,
bring your husband too!

1443
01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:39,685
Yeah!

1444
01:43:39,786 --> 01:43:43,755
And definitely no presents,
just come!

1445
01:43:44,624 --> 01:43:46,317
What dress code?

1446
01:43:46,418 --> 01:43:50,053
It's an impromptu.
You can wear sweat pants!

1447
01:43:51,089 --> 01:43:56,852
And definitely no presents!
Just come and eat hors d'oeuvres!

1448
01:43:57,888 --> 01:43:59,997
You know my culinary skills!

1449
01:44:00,098 --> 01:44:05,235
Right!
We'll get drunk in the daytime.

1450
01:44:06,813 --> 01:44:10,324
If you'd sing, that'd be grand!
You know the one...

1451
01:44:26,374 --> 01:44:29,176
Quiet, he's sleeping!

1452
01:44:29,711 --> 01:44:32,780
Today the sky's so blue,
and no pollution!

1453
01:44:32,881 --> 01:44:35,057
Thanks to all the rain yesterday.

1454
01:44:36,092 --> 01:44:37,326
Right.

1455
01:44:37,427 --> 01:44:41,522
So we traded camping
for a garden party.

1456
01:44:42,557 --> 01:44:44,358
Lemons into lemonade.

1457
01:44:47,479 --> 01:44:52,533
Right, that rain
was such a blessing!

1458
01:44:54,069 --> 01:44:58,580
And definitely no presents,
I mean it!

1459
01:44:59,115 --> 01:45:03,001
Right, just squeeze your
Mini Cooper into the garage.

1460
01:45:03,270 --> 01:45:04,270
Go on up!

1461
01:45:04,371 --> 01:45:09,283
Right, back it in.
Just don't block the Benz!

1462
01:45:09,384 --> 01:45:12,484
You're here!
It's been so long!

1463
01:45:15,507 --> 01:45:17,849
I told you no presents!

1464
01:45:35,902 --> 01:45:38,036
You were thinking of
something else.

1465
01:45:38,196 --> 01:45:39,580
What?

1466
01:45:40,615 --> 01:45:43,792
While kissing me,
you thought of something else.

1467
01:45:45,912 --> 01:45:47,170
No.

1468
01:45:48,206 --> 01:45:51,842
What do you mean?
You're doing it now, too.

1469
01:45:54,379 --> 01:45:55,637
Wow.

1470
01:45:57,257 --> 01:45:59,975
Everyone looks gorgeous, right?

1471
01:46:01,386 --> 01:46:05,147
Even for a sudden gathering,
they're so cool.

1472
01:46:06,016 --> 01:46:08,400
And look so natural.

1473
01:46:10,437 --> 01:46:11,695
Da-hye.

1474
01:46:14,274 --> 01:46:15,907
Do I fit in here?

1475
01:46:17,285 --> 01:46:19,011
What?

1476
01:46:19,946 --> 01:46:22,956
In this setting, do I fit in?

1477
01:46:32,876 --> 01:46:35,093
Hey, where are you going?

1478
01:46:35,628 --> 01:46:36,845
I need to go down.

1479
01:46:37,380 --> 01:46:39,389
Just stay with me.

1480
01:46:40,383 --> 01:46:42,309
I need to go down there.

1481
01:46:42,719 --> 01:46:47,731
Why go to those boring people?
Can't you stay here?

1482
01:46:48,725 --> 01:46:53,003
Not to those people,
down lower.

1483
01:46:53,104 --> 01:46:56,031
Wow, what is that?

1484
01:46:59,069 --> 01:47:02,954
God, I can't believe
I'm doing this at my age.

1485
01:47:03,490 --> 01:47:05,457
It's so embarrassing.

1486
01:47:06,493 --> 01:47:07,935
I'm really sorry, Mr. Kim.

1487
01:47:08,036 --> 01:47:11,230
Da-song's mom insisted,
it can’t be helped.

1488
01:47:11,331 --> 01:47:12,898
But the concept is simple.

1489
01:47:12,999 --> 01:47:18,320
There'll be a parade with
Jessica carrying a birthday cake.

1490
01:47:18,421 --> 01:47:22,408
Then we jump out
and attack Jessica.

1491
01:47:22,509 --> 01:47:24,743
Swinging our tomahawks!

1492
01:47:24,844 --> 01:47:25,619
Right.

1493
01:47:25,720 --> 01:47:31,149
Just then, Da-song the good Indian
will jump out and we'll do battle.

1494
01:47:31,309 --> 01:47:35,879
Finally, he'll save Jessica,
the cake princess, and they'll all cheer.

1495
01:47:35,980 --> 01:47:37,572
Something like that.

1496
01:47:38,717 --> 01:47:39,717
Silly, isn't it?

1497
01:47:39,818 --> 01:47:44,638
I guess your wife likes
events and surprises.

1498
01:47:44,739 --> 01:47:46,832
Yeah, she does.

1499
01:47:46,991 --> 01:47:49,960
But she's particularly into this party.

1500
01:47:51,496 --> 01:47:54,464
You're trying your best, too.

1501
01:47:55,500 --> 01:47:58,468
Well, you love her,
after all.

1502
01:48:04,008 --> 01:48:05,108
Mr. Kim.

1503
01:48:06,761 --> 01:48:09,396
You're getting paid extra.

1504
01:48:14,561 --> 01:48:18,905
Think of this as
part of your work, okay?

1505
01:48:30,201 --> 01:48:31,852
Did you go down below?

1506
01:48:31,953 --> 01:48:35,689
- Not yet.
- Shouldn't we talk to them?

1507
01:48:35,790 --> 01:48:37,608
Reach an understanding?

1508
01:48:37,709 --> 01:48:38,650
Exactly!

1509
01:48:38,751 --> 01:48:41,528
We all got too fucking
worked up last night.

1510
01:48:41,629 --> 01:48:45,557
Dad was going on
about some plan...

1511
01:48:45,967 --> 01:48:48,410
- I'm just going down there.
- Hold on.

1512
01:48:48,511 --> 01:48:50,704
Take this down to them.

1513
01:48:50,805 --> 01:48:52,414
- They must be hungry.
- Right.

1514
01:48:52,515 --> 01:48:54,483
Let them eat first.

1515
01:48:56,394 --> 01:48:58,028
Coffee next time for Sure!

1516
01:48:59,063 --> 01:49:00,798
Here you are, Jessica.

1517
01:49:00,899 --> 01:49:03,258
- This is so amazing.
- Isn't it great?

1518
01:49:03,359 --> 01:49:05,844
I've got a special favor to ask.

1519
01:49:05,945 --> 01:49:07,120
What is it?

1520
01:49:07,363 --> 01:49:09,431
This is... how to describe it?

1521
01:49:09,532 --> 01:49:11,475
Da-song's trauma recovery cake?

1522
01:49:11,576 --> 01:49:15,045
So it needs to be you who does it.
Today's highlight!

1523
01:50:37,996 --> 01:50:41,381
Hey, are you okay?

1524
01:50:46,421 --> 01:50:47,929
Are you...?

1525
01:50:57,974 --> 01:50:59,274
Wait, mister!

1526
01:52:46,290 --> 01:52:49,300
Kevin? Kevin!

1527
01:52:55,842 --> 01:52:58,577
Da-song, happy birthday!

1528
01:52:58,678 --> 01:53:00,145
Congratulations!

1529
01:53:07,398 --> 01:53:08,824
Shit...

1530
01:53:18,499 --> 01:53:20,599
Stop!

1531
01:53:20,700 --> 01:53:22,809
Chung-sook!

1532
01:53:22,910 --> 01:53:23,685
Ki-jung!

1533
01:53:23,786 --> 01:53:25,395
Come out here, Chung-sook!

1534
01:53:25,496 --> 01:53:28,906
Stop the blood!
Push down on the wound!

1535
01:53:33,368 --> 01:53:34,803
Da-song!

1536
01:53:35,459 --> 01:53:36,678
Honey!

1537
01:53:37,860 --> 01:53:39,585
Let go, don't!

1538
01:53:50,936 --> 01:53:52,699
It hurts.

1539
01:53:57,197 --> 01:53:58,387
The emergency room!

1540
01:53:58,488 --> 01:54:00,021
Get the car!

1541
01:54:00,122 --> 01:54:01,665
Mr. Kim!
What are you doing?

1542
01:54:01,766 --> 01:54:03,892
We can't wait for an ambulance!

1543
01:54:03,993 --> 01:54:06,403
Stop pushing, Dad!

1544
01:54:06,504 --> 01:54:09,464
Makes it hurt more.

1545
01:54:10,124 --> 01:54:11,274
Car keys!
The car keys!

1546
01:54:11,375 --> 01:54:14,192
Throw them!
Throw me the key!

1547
01:54:31,812 --> 01:54:33,388
Are you okay?

1548
01:54:33,489 --> 01:54:35,490
Don't touch it!

1549
01:54:37,561 --> 01:54:40,078
Hello, Mr. Park.

1550
01:54:40,196 --> 01:54:41,263
You know me?

1551
01:54:41,364 --> 01:54:43,039
Respect!

1552
01:56:09,702 --> 01:56:13,063
<i>Opening my eyes for
the first time in a month,</i>

1553
01:56:13,164 --> 01:56:14,964
<i>I saw a detective.</i>

1554
01:56:15,124 --> 01:56:19,903
You have the right
to an attorney...

1555
01:56:20,004 --> 01:56:22,305
<i>Who looked nothing
like a detective.</i>

1556
01:56:26,844 --> 01:56:28,537
Is he laughing?

1557
01:56:28,638 --> 01:56:30,313
Just a sec.

1558
01:56:30,723 --> 01:56:35,568
<i>Then the doctor who looked
nothing like a doctor spoke.</i>

1559
01:56:36,604 --> 01:56:40,382
That happens sometimes
after brain surgery.

1560
01:56:40,483 --> 01:56:42,700
They keep laughing.
For no reason.

1561
01:56:43,361 --> 01:56:45,578
Do you hear me?

1562
01:56:45,821 --> 01:56:47,705
Can you hear me?

1563
01:56:47,823 --> 01:56:49,599
Then do I have to do it again?

1564
01:56:49,700 --> 01:56:50,517
Do what?

1565
01:56:50,618 --> 01:56:52,168
The Miranda thing.

1566
01:56:54,705 --> 01:56:58,525
You have the right to remain silent.

1567
01:56:58,626 --> 01:57:01,361
Anything you say can and
will be used against you...

1568
01:57:01,462 --> 01:57:03,846
He keeps laughing, look!

1569
01:57:06,884 --> 01:57:12,981
<i>Even when I heard how much
Ki-jung bled that day...</i>

1570
01:57:15,142 --> 01:57:22,357
<i>Even when I heard the words forgery,
trespassing, foul play, self-defense</i>

1571
01:57:22,608 --> 01:57:26,995
<i>and we were lucky to
get away with a probation...</i>

1572
01:57:30,032 --> 01:57:33,059
<i>Even when I finally
got to see Ki-jung's face...</i>

1573
01:57:33,160 --> 01:57:36,170
Kim Ki-jung. RIP

1574
01:57:37,707 --> 01:57:40,008
<i>I kept laughing.</i>

1575
01:57:49,677 --> 01:57:55,165
<i>Still, when I went back and
watched the news reports,</i>

1576
01:57:55,266 --> 01:57:56,458
<i>I didn't laugh.</i>

1577
01:57:56,559 --> 01:58:00,629
This sudden rampage in the
back yard of an upper-class home

1578
01:58:00,730 --> 01:58:02,339
is a highly unusual case.

1579
01:58:02,440 --> 01:58:06,843
Since the homeless man who sparked
the rampage died at the scene,

1580
01:58:06,944 --> 01:58:12,307
police are struggling to even
establish a clear motive.

1581
01:58:12,408 --> 01:58:16,895
The driver Kim and the slain Mr. Park
are said to have been on good terms.

1582
01:58:16,996 --> 01:58:22,508
For now the police investigation is
focused on locating the driver Kim.

1583
01:58:23,043 --> 01:58:26,780
Kim, after exiting this door
and descending the stairs,

1584
01:58:26,881 --> 01:58:30,391
disappeared into the
neighboring alleys.

1585
01:58:30,926 --> 01:58:36,064
Police searched the CCTVs
of nearby homes to no avail,

1586
01:58:36,599 --> 01:58:39,734
and they have yet
to find any witnesses.

1587
01:58:40,269 --> 01:58:42,337
Given the situation,

1588
01:58:42,438 --> 01:58:47,700
it's not an exaggeration to say
that Kim vanished into thin air.

1589
01:58:48,819 --> 01:58:55,784
<i>Actually Mom and I had
no idea where Dad was.</i>

1590
01:58:58,120 --> 01:59:03,800
<i>But those detectives still
wore themselves out tailing us.</i>

1591
01:59:07,838 --> 01:59:13,810
<i>Eventually the news went quiet,
and after the tails stopped,</i>

1592
01:59:14,345 --> 01:59:17,772
<i>I started going up that mountain.</i>

1593
01:59:19,809 --> 01:59:24,529
<i>From up there, you get
a great view of the house.</i>

1594
01:59:27,274 --> 01:59:34,405
<i>That day, despite the cold.
I felt like staying longer.</i>

1595
01:59:47,753 --> 01:59:51,264
Dash-dash-dot-dot

1596
02:00:16,323 --> 02:00:17,707
Son!

1597
02:00:19,743 --> 02:00:21,085
Son!

1598
02:00:23,122 --> 02:00:26,966
<i>Perhaps you, if no one else.
will be able to read this letter.</i>

1599
02:00:30,504 --> 02:00:36,809
<i>You were a Boy Scout,
so I'm writing this just in case.</i>

1600
02:00:39,847 --> 02:00:42,815
<i>Have your injuries healed?</i>

1601
02:00:43,851 --> 02:00:48,154
<i>I'm sure your mom
is plenty healthy.</i>

1602
02:00:52,192 --> 02:00:54,994
<i>I'm doing fine in here.</i>

1603
02:00:56,030 --> 02:00:58,789
<i>Though thinking
of Ki-jung makes me cry.</i>

1604
02:01:01,827 --> 02:01:06,672
<i>Even now, what happened
that day doesn't seem real.</i>

1605
02:01:07,917 --> 02:01:09,634
<i>It feels like a dream,</i>

1606
02:01:11,170 --> 02:01:13,137
<i>and yet it doesn't.</i>

1607
02:01:14,173 --> 02:01:19,143
<i>That day as I went out the gate,
I suddenly knew.</i>

1608
02:01:20,179 --> 02:01:21,938
<i>Where I needed to go...</i>

1609
02:02:01,345 --> 02:02:04,330
<i>A house where such
grisly crime took place</i>

1610
02:02:04,431 --> 02:02:07,692
<i>would surely not
be easy to sell.</i>

1611
02:02:10,813 --> 02:02:13,214
I'm sorry, Mr. Park.

1612
02:02:13,315 --> 02:02:19,870
<i>I struggled to hold out
like that in an empty house.</i>

1613
02:02:22,408 --> 02:02:25,310
<i>Still, thanks to
the house being empty.</i>

1614
02:02:25,411 --> 02:02:30,273
<i>what was her name?
Moon-gwang?</i>

1615
02:02:30,374 --> 02:02:34,677
<i>I was able to give her
a proper send off.</i>

1616
02:02:35,796 --> 02:02:42,560
<i>I hear tree-side burials are trendy.
so hell, I did my best.</i>

1617
02:02:46,098 --> 02:02:49,734
<i>But those real estate sharks
sure are clever.</i>

1618
02:02:54,273 --> 02:02:58,509
<i>They hoodwinked some people
who had just arrived in Korea</i>

1619
02:02:58,610 --> 02:03:00,953
<i>and managed to sell the house.</i>

1620
02:03:02,072 --> 02:03:05,350
<i>With the parents working,
and the kids attending school,</i>

1621
02:03:05,451 --> 02:03:08,044
<i>the family is usually out.</i>

1622
02:03:08,162 --> 02:03:13,591
<i>But the goddamned housekeeper
stays there 24 hours a day.</i>

1623
02:03:13,751 --> 02:03:18,679
<i>Each time I go upstairs,
I take my life in my hands.</i>

1624
02:03:21,216 --> 02:03:25,561
<i>It turns out Germans eat more
than just sausage and beer.</i>

1625
02:03:26,096 --> 02:03:28,147
<i>What a relief.</i>

1626
02:03:30,726 --> 02:03:35,112
<i>Passing the time down here,
everything starts to go hazy.</i>

1627
02:03:39,651 --> 02:03:43,829
<i>Today at least
I was able to write you a letter.</i>

1628
02:03:45,365 --> 02:03:49,268
<i>If I send out the letter
this way every night,</i>

1629
02:03:49,369 --> 02:03:53,839
<i>maybe someday you'll see it.</i>

1630
02:03:59,880 --> 02:04:01,931
<i>So long.</i>

1631
02:04:15,479 --> 02:04:16,546
You're home, Ki-woo?

1632
02:04:16,647 --> 02:04:17,747
Yeah.

1633
02:04:32,162 --> 02:04:37,174
<i>Dad, today I made a plan.</i>

1634
02:04:38,710 --> 02:04:40,636
<i>A fundamental plan.</i>

1635
02:04:43,674 --> 02:04:45,349
<i>I'm going to earn money.</i>

1636
02:04:45,926 --> 02:04:47,726
<i>A lot of it.</i>

1637
02:04:51,265 --> 02:04:55,776
<i>University, a career, marriage.
those are all fine,</i>

1638
02:04:55,936 --> 02:04:57,962
<i>but first I'll earn money.</i>

1639
02:04:58,063 --> 02:05:03,409
You'll see once you go in,
but it's very spacious.

1640
02:05:03,944 --> 02:05:08,681
Actually, we don't show
this house to just anyone.

1641
02:05:08,782 --> 02:05:13,294
<i>When I have money,
I'll buy that house.</i>

1642
02:05:14,329 --> 02:05:18,591
<i>On the day we move in,
Mom and I will be in the yard.</i>

1643
02:05:19,126 --> 02:05:21,552
<i>Because the sunshine
is so nice there.</i>

1644
02:05:22,713 --> 02:05:24,763
<i>All you'll need to do</i>

1645
02:05:24,923 --> 02:05:27,808
<i>is walk up the stairs.</i>

1646
02:06:50,425 --> 02:06:54,562
<i>Take care until then.</i>

1647
02:06:59,226 --> 02:07:01,360
<i>So long.</i>

1648
02:07:09,422 --> 02:07:14,722
