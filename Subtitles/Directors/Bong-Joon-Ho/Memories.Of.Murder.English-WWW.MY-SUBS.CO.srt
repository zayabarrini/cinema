1
00:02:15,685 --> 00:02:18,771
Junk car! Junk car!

2
00:02:36,831 --> 00:02:38,499
Get out of here, kid.

3
00:02:56,058 --> 00:02:57,560
I told you to get out of here.

4
00:03:05,735 --> 00:03:11,532
OCTOBER 23, 1986

5
00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:23,377
- Go home, kid.
- Go home, kid.

6
00:03:24,378 --> 00:03:26,756
- Little brat.
- Little brat.

7
00:03:28,132 --> 00:03:31,051
- What the hell are they doing?
- What the hell are they doing?

8
00:03:31,135 --> 00:03:32,636
- Hey, you!
- Hey, you!

9
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,555
- Put that back!
- Put that back!

10
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:41,061
Hey, leave it there. Go away.

11
00:03:41,145 --> 00:03:42,396
- Hey, you!
- Hey, you!

12
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,858
- That's important, don't touch!
- That's important, don't touch!

13
00:03:47,485 --> 00:03:50,196
- Those kids.
- Those kids.

14
00:04:24,689 --> 00:04:28,818
MEMORIES OF MURDER

15
00:04:32,947 --> 00:04:33,948
What?

16
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,951
You dated the dead girl,
and she dumped you last August?

17
00:04:38,035 --> 00:04:39,370
Is that right?

18
00:04:40,162 --> 00:04:41,788
That's correct.

19
00:04:41,872 --> 00:04:45,626
That's correct?
Take off your hat, you damn punk.

20
00:04:47,545 --> 00:04:49,839
Do women like guys like you?

21
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:58,014
<i>After watching Body Heat...</i>

22
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,058
<i>Body Heat? That an action movie?</i>

23
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:04,478
A, C, T...

24
00:05:11,652 --> 00:05:13,445
Damn punk.

25
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:18,159
Since it's a rape and murder case and all

26
00:05:19,577 --> 00:05:20,745
well...

27
00:05:21,579 --> 00:05:25,832
If she was sexy, or pretty,
that sort of thing.

28
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:27,126
Your impressions?

29
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:29,253
Well

30
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:32,798
she didn't seem like a country girl...

31
00:05:34,592 --> 00:05:35,593
Don't blink.

32
00:05:38,429 --> 00:05:39,596
You blinked, didn't you?

33
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,515
Hey, look at me.

34
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:46,771
Don't look at the ceiling, look at me!

35
00:05:48,272 --> 00:05:51,484
Was he born that way? One, two...

36
00:06:04,205 --> 00:06:07,666
Didn't you want to go
to the Military Academy?

37
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,251
Did you take the exam?

38
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:12,588
You need to study hard to get in there.

39
00:06:15,633 --> 00:06:18,552
- Receipt!
- You didn't ask for one.

40
00:06:18,636 --> 00:06:21,263
What? I told you to bring one.

41
00:06:21,806 --> 00:06:24,266
- I told you.
- No you didn't.

42
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,601
That's what you said last time...

43
00:06:26,685 --> 00:06:29,105
Here's one, here.

44
00:06:30,272 --> 00:06:34,693
You answered the phone, you lying bastard.

45
00:06:34,777 --> 00:06:38,906
I need a receipt from the restaurant.
Not from a bicycle shop.

46
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:47,373
DIRECTED BY BONG JOON HO

47
00:06:50,668 --> 00:06:52,836
Why didn't you rope the place off?

48
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,465
At least get some sticks
to drive them in, morons.

49
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:59,051
Inspector Park, over here!

50
00:07:00,177 --> 00:07:02,179
- What is this?
- It's a footprint.

51
00:07:02,596 --> 00:07:05,807
- When did you find it?
- This morning, sir!

52
00:07:05,891 --> 00:07:07,601
Go help those jerks over there.

53
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:12,398
- You called the forensics team?
- Yes, they're on their way.

54
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:17,069
But where's the person who reported this?

55
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:22,324
No forensics team, this is total chaos!

56
00:07:22,741 --> 00:07:24,618
Jesus, look at him!

57
00:07:26,495 --> 00:07:27,746
Hey!

58
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:28,998
Get out of here!

59
00:07:32,209 --> 00:07:34,211
Who received the call on this?

60
00:07:34,295 --> 00:07:36,129
Did you find out who reported it?

61
00:07:36,213 --> 00:07:38,673
The phone...
The crime site is getting ruined.

62
00:07:38,757 --> 00:07:42,010
Damn forensics team's not here,
this is a mess.

63
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:44,679
What are you talking about?

64
00:07:44,763 --> 00:07:48,726
Take pictures when I tell you!

65
00:07:49,518 --> 00:07:51,937
Why'd you bring so many reporters?

66
00:07:52,021 --> 00:07:54,899
They were all here when I arrived.

67
00:07:55,816 --> 00:07:58,443
Reporter Park's not here.
Must be on vacation.

68
00:07:58,527 --> 00:08:01,571
- I don't see him.
- Feels great with that shithead gone.

69
00:08:01,655 --> 00:08:05,158
Why does this have to happen to me?

70
00:08:05,242 --> 00:08:08,161
How can I investigate like this?

71
00:08:08,245 --> 00:08:12,457
Hey, tractor! Hey, tractor!

72
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:13,959
Tractor!

73
00:08:15,044 --> 00:08:19,757
Tractor, stay away! Detour!

74
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:25,595
If someone waves, shouldn't you look?

75
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:27,389
Shit, is he deaf?

76
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:30,976
Shit! Look at this.

77
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,854
Now those bastards show up.

78
00:08:36,273 --> 00:08:39,485
What the hell took you so long?

79
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:42,737
The crime scene's ruined!

80
00:08:42,821 --> 00:08:47,075
Jesus, look at these sliding fools!

81
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:49,036
What's going on?

82
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:58,963
How can you look at those photos
while eating?

83
00:09:00,714 --> 00:09:03,884
If I keep staring at them,

84
00:09:03,968 --> 00:09:06,178
one moment it'll hit me.

85
00:09:06,262 --> 00:09:08,806
- Instinctively.
- Are you a fortune teller?

86
00:09:09,473 --> 00:09:11,141
Open up a shop then.

87
00:09:11,976 --> 00:09:17,398
Chief, I may know nothing else,
but my eyes can read people.

88
00:09:18,607 --> 00:09:20,567
It's how I survive as a detective.

89
00:09:20,651 --> 00:09:24,905
There's a reason people say
I have shaman's eyes.

90
00:09:25,823 --> 00:09:27,491
Okay, then.

91
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,202
You see those two guys there?

92
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:38,126
One of them's a rapist,
and the other is the victim's brother.

93
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:45,210
He caught the guy doing this
to his sister, and dragged him in.

94
00:09:48,429 --> 00:09:54,018
So tell me, which one's the rapist?

95
00:10:06,947 --> 00:10:08,573
- Hey.
- What?

96
00:10:08,657 --> 00:10:09,866
I think it fell out.

97
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:11,243
Really?

98
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:13,579
Let's do this properly.

99
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,711
I'll give this to you especially today.

100
00:10:21,795 --> 00:10:23,172
I'm so grateful.

101
00:10:25,466 --> 00:10:27,676
It's just a flu shot.

102
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:29,803
Know how much this costs?

103
00:10:32,806 --> 00:10:34,808
- Kwak Seol-yeong?
- Yeah?

104
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:38,687
You must be earning more now
than at the hospital.

105
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:44,859
I hear everyone in town comes to you.

106
00:10:44,943 --> 00:10:47,863
Shh. I got something to tell you.

107
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:51,283
I heard this from the old woman
at the mill.

108
00:10:52,242 --> 00:10:55,829
You know the Baek family meat restaurant?

109
00:10:56,497 --> 00:10:57,748
The Baek family?

110
00:10:58,582 --> 00:11:01,627
You know what people call them?

111
00:11:02,044 --> 00:11:03,045
What?

112
00:11:04,421 --> 00:11:06,298
The Baek Lady Killers.

113
00:11:07,508 --> 00:11:10,177
- Ladies?
- Yeah.

114
00:11:10,844 --> 00:11:15,933
But the son's a little bit retarded.
Kwang-ho.

115
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:21,730
Kwang-ho used to follow
Hyang-sook around all the time.

116
00:11:22,272 --> 00:11:24,733
Hyang-sook? The one who was killed?

117
00:11:25,442 --> 00:11:26,527
Yeah.

118
00:11:27,444 --> 00:11:32,449
She was found with a girdle over her head?

119
00:11:32,533 --> 00:11:33,534
Right.

120
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,537
Even more important,

121
00:11:36,954 --> 00:11:39,498
the night she was killed,

122
00:11:40,165 --> 00:11:43,752
that old woman saw Kwang-ho following her.

123
00:11:46,046 --> 00:11:48,674
- Really?
- That's what I'm saying.

124
00:11:49,258 --> 00:11:52,136
I heard that old hag
went senile last year.

125
00:11:52,719 --> 00:11:54,179
No, she's fine.

126
00:11:59,476 --> 00:12:02,563
That kid... Wait.

127
00:12:03,272 --> 00:12:06,024
Kwang-ho? What's he look like?

128
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:11,655
This side of his face is a bit...
you know.

129
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:14,491
Tell me in detail.

130
00:12:15,576 --> 00:12:17,369
Anyways, he's a poor little kid.

131
00:12:42,436 --> 00:12:43,604
Kwang-ho.

132
00:12:44,938 --> 00:12:47,107
Let's talk man to man.

133
00:12:47,191 --> 00:12:50,527
You see a pretty girl, you want to do her.

134
00:12:51,111 --> 00:12:56,408
When I was your age,
I'd go out with friends, I understand.

135
00:12:57,075 --> 00:13:03,123
You never intended
to kill Hyang-sook at first, huh?

136
00:13:03,207 --> 00:13:05,667
"How about just touching her breast..."

137
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:07,293
I couldn't touch it.

138
00:13:07,377 --> 00:13:10,130
So you killed her?
Kill her, then you can touch it.

139
00:13:10,214 --> 00:13:11,381
No, I didn't.

140
00:13:15,469 --> 00:13:19,264
That guy coming down now,
he's had a hard life, like you.

141
00:13:19,348 --> 00:13:20,766
He's nice.

142
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:25,895
He's really sweet. He never beats anyone.

143
00:13:25,979 --> 00:13:29,065
But sometimes, you know,

144
00:13:29,149 --> 00:13:32,277
if he gets worked up about something...

145
00:13:35,989 --> 00:13:39,576
God, what an ugly face.

146
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,665
Just looking at this face makes me angry.

147
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,043
Shit.

148
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:50,796
Shit.

149
00:13:59,012 --> 00:14:00,264
Pretty?

150
00:14:01,181 --> 00:14:05,059
This is so it won't leave scratches,
you punk.

151
00:14:05,143 --> 00:14:06,270
Hey, hey...

152
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:08,605
What's with the army boots?

153
00:14:09,189 --> 00:14:10,816
Doing this to the kid...

154
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:13,402
Kwang-ho, get up.

155
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:20,284
Are you really innocent? Huh?

156
00:14:21,285 --> 00:14:22,619
Look in my eyes.

157
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:24,996
Huh?

158
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,916
Where the hell's he looking?
Look in my eyes!

159
00:14:41,471 --> 00:14:48,471
TURN YOURSELF IN,
OR MAY YOU ROT AND DIE.

160
00:15:06,455 --> 00:15:08,749
Excuse me, miss...

161
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:10,667
Hello?

162
00:15:13,086 --> 00:15:14,379
Oh, miss?

163
00:15:14,463 --> 00:15:16,798
Are you all right?

164
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:18,007
Why are you following me?

165
00:15:18,091 --> 00:15:22,095
No, I just wanted to ask directions.

166
00:15:22,179 --> 00:15:23,472
Let me help you.

167
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:27,892
Let go!

168
00:15:27,976 --> 00:15:30,354
What's wrong?

169
00:15:30,979 --> 00:15:33,690
Rolling in the fields, huh?
Is this town a rapist's paradise?

170
00:15:33,774 --> 00:15:35,817
You shithead.

171
00:15:40,656 --> 00:15:43,616
What the hell?

172
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,868
Who are you?

173
00:15:47,287 --> 00:15:48,747
Get over here.

174
00:15:49,164 --> 00:15:52,709
Hey, miss!
The victim needs to file a report!

175
00:15:55,128 --> 00:15:56,129
Miss!

176
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:07,432
Where is she going?

177
00:16:07,516 --> 00:16:09,601
Are you a detective?

178
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:14,940
You should have told me.

179
00:16:16,233 --> 00:16:17,442
My mistake.

180
00:16:18,527 --> 00:16:21,154
How can a detective be such a bad fighter?

181
00:16:24,491 --> 00:16:28,245
How can a detective have
such a bad eye for criminals?

182
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:34,042
What's that smell?

183
00:16:34,584 --> 00:16:37,754
Oh, sneakers. They smell bad?

184
00:16:37,838 --> 00:16:42,050
But these here are evidence item #28.

185
00:17:08,243 --> 00:17:09,870
Develop these quickly, huh?

186
00:17:12,873 --> 00:17:15,124
- Uh, chief.
- What?

187
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:17,294
This guy here... from Seoul.

188
00:17:17,878 --> 00:17:21,381
Nice to meet you! I got the call...

189
00:17:21,465 --> 00:17:22,674
But

190
00:17:23,508 --> 00:17:24,801
your face...

191
00:17:25,761 --> 00:17:28,096
Did anything happen?

192
00:17:28,805 --> 00:17:30,515
- No, nothing.
- A desk, you need...

193
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:34,019
Oh, I prepared a desk over there
with lots of sunlight.

194
00:17:35,812 --> 00:17:38,231
I think... I like that corner.

195
00:17:40,817 --> 00:17:42,903
Okay, okay! As you wish.

196
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:47,699
Inspector Jo, say hello.

197
00:17:49,326 --> 00:17:50,494
From Seoul,

198
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:54,914
Seo Tae-... yoon, senior officer.

199
00:17:54,998 --> 00:17:56,958
Jo Yong-go. Nice to meet you.

200
00:17:57,042 --> 00:18:00,629
He volunteered to assist
with this investigation.

201
00:18:01,129 --> 00:18:02,839
Quite an uncommon thing.

202
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,967
Well, go arrange your desk.

203
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:07,677
Yes, sit down.

204
00:18:07,761 --> 00:18:11,264
INSPECTOR CHIEF

205
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:25,987
The song is great. The opening song.

206
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:29,323
<i>I always watch Inspector Chief with Dad.</i>

207
00:18:29,407 --> 00:18:31,284
What was my phone number?

208
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:33,411
Just eat.

209
00:18:33,495 --> 00:18:36,206
Right, I need to call Dad!

210
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:39,084
I should call. Oh, it's Dad!

211
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:50,220
Hey, Kwang-ho.

212
00:18:52,889 --> 00:18:53,974
Listen.

213
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:58,811
This footprint was found
at the site of Hyang-sook's murder.

214
00:18:58,895 --> 00:18:59,896
Look.

215
00:19:00,438 --> 00:19:02,940
And these are sneakers
we found at your house.

216
00:19:03,024 --> 00:19:05,235
You wear these? Right?

217
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:08,362
Now, look closely.

218
00:19:08,446 --> 00:19:13,410
The footprint in this photo,
and the sole of your shoe.

219
00:19:14,327 --> 00:19:15,537
The same, right?

220
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:18,039
This pattern?

221
00:19:18,665 --> 00:19:22,836
The circle, this indentation?
Exactly the same.

222
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,130
Am I right?

223
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:30,135
This part was smudged,
don't worry about that.

224
00:19:34,472 --> 00:19:36,266
You killed all those women, right?

225
00:19:38,351 --> 00:19:39,436
Okay.

226
00:19:40,729 --> 00:19:44,357
You didn't kill them all, right?

227
00:19:46,943 --> 00:19:50,655
<i>So you didn't not kill only Hyang-sook,
correct?</i>

228
00:19:52,657 --> 00:19:53,866
I didn't kill anyone.

229
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:57,579
We've got the evidence here!

230
00:19:59,289 --> 00:20:01,374
- Where's our shovel?
- Shovel?

231
00:20:03,585 --> 00:20:05,962
Look at you...

232
00:20:07,589 --> 00:20:10,592
Hey, bastard. Give me that.

233
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:14,011
Can't you even shovel right? Watch me.

234
00:20:14,095 --> 00:20:17,682
Loosen the dirt first.
Then push with your foot.

235
00:20:17,766 --> 00:20:19,517
- Kwang-ho!
- Yes?

236
00:20:19,601 --> 00:20:21,811
You punk.

237
00:20:23,521 --> 00:20:26,899
Did you come here to play?

238
00:20:26,983 --> 00:20:29,235
You know where this is?

239
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:30,903
We came here to bury you.

240
00:20:30,987 --> 00:20:34,824
- What? Why?
- Why?

241
00:20:34,908 --> 00:20:37,243
Because you won't listen, you bastard.

242
00:20:37,327 --> 00:20:40,413
- I'm a good boy.
- Then tell me!

243
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,417
Out here in the fresh air. With that face.

244
00:20:44,918 --> 00:20:46,336
Hey, come here.

245
00:20:46,878 --> 00:20:50,131
Women hate this face, don't they?

246
00:20:50,674 --> 00:20:53,050
They grimace and all fucking run away.

247
00:20:53,134 --> 00:20:54,260
It's true.

248
00:20:54,928 --> 00:20:56,554
I'll kill them all.

249
00:20:59,015 --> 00:21:02,811
Everyone who grimaces at my face.

250
00:21:03,812 --> 00:21:05,355
I'll kill them all.

251
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,653
Those women who grimace,
they're all in my head.

252
00:21:14,155 --> 00:21:16,866
- Hyang-sook too?
- Hyang-sook?

253
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:19,744
Hyang-sook.
You always followed her around.

254
00:21:19,828 --> 00:21:22,664
- Hyang-sook is pretty.
- Oh, yeah, she's pretty.

255
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:26,167
But Hyang-sook grimaced too, huh?

256
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:28,502
She said, "Fuck, get away!" didn't she?

257
00:21:28,586 --> 00:21:31,380
Because you liked her.

258
00:21:31,464 --> 00:21:32,966
So you killed her, huh?

259
00:21:41,474 --> 00:21:44,853
By the train tracks. In that rice paddy.

260
00:21:45,311 --> 00:21:47,772
The train tracks? Right.

261
00:21:47,856 --> 00:21:51,192
Her throat. Hyang-sook's throat,

262
00:21:51,776 --> 00:21:55,280
strangled it tightly.

263
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:58,032
- With what?
- Her brassiere.

264
00:21:58,116 --> 00:22:00,869
- Brassiere?
- With her white brassiere,

265
00:22:01,619 --> 00:22:05,289
strangled her tightly.

266
00:22:05,373 --> 00:22:07,083
- And then?
- Her stocking.

267
00:22:07,167 --> 00:22:09,794
- Her stocking?
- Pulled off her leg.

268
00:22:09,878 --> 00:22:11,587
Then it was the stocking.

269
00:22:11,671 --> 00:22:13,840
This guy's smart, huh?

270
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:17,343
- And then?
- What?

271
00:22:18,344 --> 00:22:20,263
What was it?

272
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:23,016
Something with a strap?

273
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:27,311
- A handbag strap?
- Right, a bag strap.

274
00:22:27,395 --> 00:22:34,395
Strangling Hyang-sook's throat
with it tightly.

275
00:22:36,571 --> 00:22:37,572
And?

276
00:22:38,448 --> 00:22:44,037
Then, Hyang-sook's body shook a bit.

277
00:22:44,954 --> 00:22:46,790
She looked completely dead.

278
00:22:47,665 --> 00:22:48,958
And then?

279
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:54,798
Her head was covered up.

280
00:22:55,924 --> 00:22:56,799
With what?

281
00:22:56,883 --> 00:23:03,883
Her panties.
Covered her head with her panties.

282
00:23:05,725 --> 00:23:08,769
Do you mean a girdle? That women wear?

283
00:23:08,853 --> 00:23:11,022
Right, girdle!

284
00:23:11,106 --> 00:23:15,610
Looked like it covered her head right up.

285
00:23:16,945 --> 00:23:17,987
And then?

286
00:23:18,738 --> 00:23:21,116
Um... had to dress her again.

287
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:23,952
And why was that?

288
00:23:24,953 --> 00:23:27,455
I don't know. Put the clothes back on.

289
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,541
Why was that?

290
00:23:35,088 --> 00:23:36,881
How would I know?

291
00:23:36,965 --> 00:23:38,549
You were doing well!

292
00:23:38,633 --> 00:23:40,634
Bastard! What did you do next?

293
00:23:40,718 --> 00:23:42,219
- Then... running!
- Where?

294
00:23:42,303 --> 00:23:44,180
- It was raining!
- Where did you run?

295
00:23:44,264 --> 00:23:48,017
- Kept running.
- Oh, you little shit!

296
00:23:48,101 --> 00:23:49,519
The lightning struck!

297
00:23:51,104 --> 00:23:53,647
Where the hell were you running,
you bastard!

298
00:23:53,731 --> 00:23:56,233
Yong-go, start digging.

299
00:23:56,317 --> 00:23:57,443
Huh? Digging?

300
00:23:57,527 --> 00:23:59,571
Lightning!

301
00:24:20,216 --> 00:24:24,762
<i>Citizens, this is a civil defense drill.</i>

302
00:24:24,846 --> 00:24:27,723
<i>The air raid siren has begun to sound.
This is only a drill.</i>

303
00:24:27,807 --> 00:24:30,184
<i>The entire country is now
under a civil defense drill.</i>

304
00:24:30,268 --> 00:24:34,897
<i>A blackout is called for
in all buildings and houses.</i>

305
00:24:34,981 --> 00:24:38,234
<i>Please find cover
in the nearest underground space.</i>

306
00:24:38,318 --> 00:24:45,318
<i>Follow the instructions
you hear in this broadcast.</i>

307
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:53,749
<i>Please move all flammable materials
to a safe place.</i>

308
00:24:53,833 --> 00:24:59,047
<i>Unplug all cords,
then hurry to an underground area...</i>

309
00:25:07,013 --> 00:25:09,224
Shut off the lights!

310
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,281
You forgot the breasts.

311
00:25:25,907 --> 00:25:27,492
Hey, you!

312
00:25:28,243 --> 00:25:29,535
Come here.

313
00:25:32,747 --> 00:25:35,291
- Put this on. Everyone ready?
- Yes, sir.

314
00:25:35,375 --> 00:25:36,793
Get in the car.

315
00:25:37,335 --> 00:25:38,628
Turn around.

316
00:25:39,128 --> 00:25:40,212
LEE HYANG-SOOK

317
00:25:40,296 --> 00:25:43,174
Take off your pants.

318
00:25:45,301 --> 00:25:46,719
What'll the headline be?

319
00:25:46,803 --> 00:25:50,431
"Crime-Fighting Trio"
or "Smiles of the Unstoppable."

320
00:25:50,515 --> 00:25:52,433
Inspector Park, in the back.

321
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:55,311
Make a straight line now.

322
00:25:56,521 --> 00:25:59,356
Miss Kwon, big party tonight!
Reserve a room.

323
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,859
Smile! Okay!

324
00:26:01,943 --> 00:26:05,029
This time, hold up your fist. Tight!

325
00:26:07,657 --> 00:26:10,367
- Come take a picture!
- That's okay.

326
00:26:10,451 --> 00:26:11,995
Come on!

327
00:26:17,625 --> 00:26:19,002
Wait a second.

328
00:26:27,593 --> 00:26:32,181
With these webbed fingers,
you can't even hold chopsticks, right?

329
00:26:33,016 --> 00:26:34,726
They've always been this way?

330
00:26:44,402 --> 00:26:48,072
- Kwang-ho, this is the spot, right?
- I don't know.

331
00:26:48,156 --> 00:26:50,992
What's he talking about? It was here.

332
00:26:52,327 --> 00:26:55,287
For the reenactment, you have to act well.

333
00:26:55,371 --> 00:26:59,000
There are a lot of reporters here.

334
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:00,417
How's this?

335
00:27:00,501 --> 00:27:02,211
A bit lower.

336
00:27:02,295 --> 00:27:04,922
- What do we start with?
- Wait.

337
00:27:05,006 --> 00:27:09,969
It's best to write down the correct order.

338
00:27:10,053 --> 00:27:12,513
Then why didn't you do it?
I'm fucking busy.

339
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:14,015
Chief.

340
00:27:14,849 --> 00:27:18,102
The reenactment
isn't going to work anyway.

341
00:27:19,062 --> 00:27:22,106
Call it off before
it becomes an embarrassment.

342
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:26,944
Hey, I told you to stay away.
Why'd you come back here?

343
00:27:27,028 --> 00:27:29,738
Just give them some excuse.
The suspect is sick, or...

344
00:27:29,822 --> 00:27:31,032
Inspector Seo!

345
00:27:32,408 --> 00:27:35,744
You're dumping shit on cooked rice here!

346
00:27:35,828 --> 00:27:38,664
I told you before, Kwang-ho isn't guilty.

347
00:27:38,748 --> 00:27:40,124
Just shut up!

348
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,334
Chief...

349
00:27:42,418 --> 00:27:46,755
The cords around their necks
were tied with three tight knots.

350
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:50,050
Look at Kwang-ho's hands.
Could he do that?

351
00:27:50,134 --> 00:27:51,802
- Get out!
- Even a child can see that.

352
00:27:51,886 --> 00:27:53,554
Get the hell out!

353
00:27:56,224 --> 00:27:57,516
Grab the brassiere strap...

354
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,061
- Hey, concentrate!
- Dad!

355
00:28:01,145 --> 00:28:04,273
Kwang-ho! It's me!

356
00:28:04,357 --> 00:28:05,691
Dad!

357
00:28:05,775 --> 00:28:09,945
- Hey, you're innocent!
- I know! I didn't do it!

358
00:28:10,029 --> 00:28:15,743
Mr. Baek Kwang-ho!
Are you denying a crime?

359
00:28:16,536 --> 00:28:20,373
He didn't kill anyone! My son's innocent!

360
00:28:22,625 --> 00:28:26,337
You were tortured, weren't you?

361
00:28:26,421 --> 00:28:29,882
My team never tortures suspects.

362
00:28:42,895 --> 00:28:44,313
It's all gone to hell.

363
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:46,065
Don't bring it up.

364
00:28:47,191 --> 00:28:52,113
Hey, did you see the look
on prosecutor Choi's face back there?

365
00:28:53,197 --> 00:28:56,325
Fuck, how can he revoke the warrant?

366
00:28:56,826 --> 00:28:58,410
We even had evidence.

367
00:28:58,494 --> 00:29:00,955
Evidence? That footprint?

368
00:29:03,416 --> 00:29:06,001
How can they set him free?

369
00:29:06,085 --> 00:29:07,503
What can we do?

370
00:29:08,629 --> 00:29:11,632
All we had was a confession.

371
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:15,969
It was no ordinary confession.
You heard the tape.

372
00:29:16,053 --> 00:29:20,057
All the details of the crime
came pouring out his mouth.

373
00:29:21,058 --> 00:29:25,062
Things he'd never know
if he weren't the killer.

374
00:29:25,146 --> 00:29:26,856
Like how she was strangled.

375
00:29:28,441 --> 00:29:30,359
You heard it too.

376
00:29:30,985 --> 00:29:33,779
Be honest,
didn't you rehearse that in advance?

377
00:29:34,197 --> 00:29:35,322
What?

378
00:29:35,406 --> 00:29:37,116
Quiet. Eat something.

379
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,201
Jesus...

380
00:29:44,248 --> 00:29:48,461
What? I said to separate
the noodles and bean sauce.

381
00:29:49,795 --> 00:29:51,881
What the fuck!

382
00:29:53,174 --> 00:29:57,344
INVESTIGATIVE TEAM RESHUFFLED

383
00:29:57,428 --> 00:30:01,641
MURDER CASE SHROUDED
IN MYSTERY ONCE AGAIN

384
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:24,037
The location of the first homicide,

385
00:30:24,121 --> 00:30:26,123
and the second homicide.

386
00:30:26,207 --> 00:30:28,584
Now, a distance of

387
00:30:30,086 --> 00:30:32,004
approximately 1000 meters.

388
00:30:32,088 --> 00:30:35,758
A length of not more than...
one kilometer.

389
00:30:44,392 --> 00:30:49,230
The victim, on the 12th and the 16th,

390
00:30:49,772 --> 00:30:53,234
both days at twelve o'clock...

391
00:30:54,151 --> 00:30:57,738
Ah, December 16th.

392
00:30:57,822 --> 00:31:01,826
On December 16th, at twelve o'clock...

393
00:31:03,035 --> 00:31:06,247
The location is Yangji Teahouse...

394
00:31:07,623 --> 00:31:09,375
Han Sung-geun,

395
00:31:09,875 --> 00:31:12,753
a 32-year-old office worker.

396
00:31:14,297 --> 00:31:17,883
An arranged date, maybe?

397
00:31:19,635 --> 00:31:22,971
Anyway, at the crime site

398
00:31:23,055 --> 00:31:27,684
were found a footprint,
two drops of blood,

399
00:31:27,768 --> 00:31:32,023
and a drop of semen.
Semen? They found semen?

400
00:31:32,565 --> 00:31:33,858
What? Yes.

401
00:31:37,612 --> 00:31:39,405
The two dead women,

402
00:31:40,072 --> 00:31:42,116
did they have anything in common?

403
00:31:44,076 --> 00:31:45,827
In common...

404
00:31:45,911 --> 00:31:47,496
Well, first,

405
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:51,167
both of them were single.

406
00:31:53,294 --> 00:31:55,671
They were both extremely beautiful.

407
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,673
And?

408
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,802
The murders all took place in the rain.

409
00:32:03,471 --> 00:32:04,721
Rain?

410
00:32:04,805 --> 00:32:06,807
He murdered them on rainy nights.

411
00:32:08,225 --> 00:32:09,477
Really?

412
00:32:09,894 --> 00:32:11,312
And red clothes.

413
00:32:11,896 --> 00:32:14,231
They all wore red clothes.

414
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:16,025
Both of them?

415
00:32:16,776 --> 00:32:18,152
No, all three of them.

416
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:21,364
Three of them?

417
00:32:21,947 --> 00:32:23,282
What are you talking about?

418
00:32:23,366 --> 00:32:27,119
Three were murdered.
We just haven't found the third body.

419
00:32:31,374 --> 00:32:34,710
This is a missing person form.
The name is quite unusual.

420
00:32:34,794 --> 00:32:38,672
Dokko Hyun-soon, age 27.
It was two months ago, July 18.

421
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:42,884
Oh, her? Dokko Hyun-soon?
I know that girl.

422
00:32:42,968 --> 00:32:46,346
Everyone in this town knows her.

423
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:49,349
A pretty girl, that Hyun-soon.

424
00:32:49,433 --> 00:32:52,770
Even a Miss Korea is no match for her.

425
00:32:53,312 --> 00:32:56,106
Did you process the missing person form,
Yong-go?

426
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:57,566
Oh, shut up.

427
00:32:58,818 --> 00:33:01,111
This is no ordinary incident, Chief.

428
00:33:01,195 --> 00:33:05,115
If you look in detail,
documents never lie.

429
00:33:05,199 --> 00:33:09,328
It says she was wearing a red shirt.

430
00:33:09,412 --> 00:33:11,205
It's right here in writing.

431
00:33:11,831 --> 00:33:13,123
What's that?

432
00:33:13,207 --> 00:33:17,377
Marked here is the weather
on the day she vanished.

433
00:33:17,461 --> 00:33:19,880
It rained on that day too.

434
00:33:21,006 --> 00:33:23,217
Rain, red clothes...

435
00:33:24,218 --> 00:33:27,054
She was murdered. By the same person.

436
00:33:27,138 --> 00:33:30,974
You don't know this town,
that's why you talk nonsense.

437
00:33:31,058 --> 00:33:35,228
She always said she'd go
to Seoul one day...

438
00:33:35,312 --> 00:33:39,400
I have an idea where the body is.
Look at the map.

439
00:33:40,693 --> 00:33:41,818
Right here...

440
00:33:41,902 --> 00:33:46,407
I marked where the victim went,
and where the body might be.

441
00:33:49,118 --> 00:33:52,788
Give me two squadrons of cops.
I'll find her in two days.

442
00:33:56,333 --> 00:33:57,793
You sure of this?

443
00:34:17,354 --> 00:34:18,605
You know,

444
00:34:18,689 --> 00:34:22,651
university students,
when they go on orientation,

445
00:34:22,735 --> 00:34:25,029
people say the guys all get laid.

446
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:30,575
A big group, guys and girls,
in one room going at it...

447
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:32,161
Is that true?

448
00:34:32,995 --> 00:34:35,122
I don't know. Hurry up.

449
00:34:36,457 --> 00:34:40,001
You went to a two-year school, didn't you?

450
00:34:40,085 --> 00:34:44,381
Student trips, orientation...
Did you go on those?

451
00:34:46,175 --> 00:34:50,345
Go ask Seo.
He went to a four-year university.

452
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:51,931
Whether he had group sex...

453
00:34:52,598 --> 00:34:54,475
Shit, four years.

454
00:34:55,768 --> 00:34:58,187
I spent four years in high school.

455
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:05,903
Shit, put that away.

456
00:35:08,531 --> 00:35:11,242
You know, I miss Dokko Hyun-soon.

457
00:35:11,659 --> 00:35:12,660
You too?

458
00:35:13,661 --> 00:35:17,081
She was just too good for this town.

459
00:35:18,791 --> 00:35:20,584
I'm telling you, she went to Seoul.

460
00:35:23,295 --> 00:35:24,505
What is it?

461
00:35:26,006 --> 00:35:27,633
Lot of snakes down there.

462
00:35:33,556 --> 00:35:36,349
Each part of a corpse
decays at a different speed.

463
00:35:36,433 --> 00:35:41,188
Look. It's old,
but the inner thigh is still firm.

464
00:35:42,481 --> 00:35:44,066
There's evidence of rape?

465
00:35:44,692 --> 00:35:46,527
A bit of semen was found.

466
00:35:47,695 --> 00:35:51,031
But it's so old,
we can't determine the blood type.

467
00:35:51,115 --> 00:35:52,992
Oh, Hyun-soon...

468
00:35:53,909 --> 00:35:58,038
This time too he used
items belonging to her.

469
00:35:58,122 --> 00:36:00,958
Right, that's her stocking
around the throat?

470
00:36:01,458 --> 00:36:02,793
Yes.

471
00:36:02,877 --> 00:36:08,089
The victim's panties on her face,
as with Hyang-sook.

472
00:36:08,173 --> 00:36:10,509
Her hands were bound the same way too.

473
00:36:10,593 --> 00:36:14,763
His methods of killing
are quite professional.

474
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:17,391
He's thorough.

475
00:36:17,933 --> 00:36:19,143
And polished.

476
00:36:21,687 --> 00:36:26,859
So there hasn't been a single witness yet.

477
00:36:29,278 --> 00:36:31,906
Would you like a bit more tenderloin?

478
00:36:32,781 --> 00:36:35,283
That's okay. We're fine.

479
00:36:35,367 --> 00:36:38,412
Where did Kwang-ho go? I don't see him.

480
00:36:39,997 --> 00:36:41,081
Is anything...?

481
00:36:41,665 --> 00:36:46,711
I bought your son something,
give it to him later.

482
00:36:46,795 --> 00:36:48,505
What's this?

483
00:36:48,589 --> 00:36:51,842
Oh, last time,
taking a look at his sneakers,

484
00:36:51,926 --> 00:36:55,095
they smelled so awful, I felt bad for him.

485
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:59,015
I thought, I'll have to buy him new shoes.

486
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:01,101
So I picked up some Nikes.

487
00:37:01,185 --> 00:37:02,978
You didn't have to...

488
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:07,441
That punk, he's always sleeping
in the strangest places!

489
00:37:10,319 --> 00:37:11,362
Kwang-ho!

490
00:37:13,614 --> 00:37:16,032
This here...
your shoe size is 250 mm, right?

491
00:37:16,116 --> 00:37:19,036
Here, Nike. Try them on.

492
00:37:20,704 --> 00:37:23,248
Give me that sneaker.

493
00:37:24,625 --> 00:37:27,794
These are "Nice," not Nike. N, I, C, E.

494
00:37:27,878 --> 00:37:31,131
Nice or Nike. Who cares?

495
00:37:32,216 --> 00:37:37,554
If you buy him sneakers,
you should get the real thing.

496
00:37:37,638 --> 00:37:39,431
Cool, huh?

497
00:37:44,561 --> 00:37:45,729
Have a drink.

498
00:37:46,647 --> 00:37:49,441
I beat you because I care for you.

499
00:37:49,525 --> 00:37:54,195
So if you see me on the street,
don't run away.

500
00:37:54,279 --> 00:37:56,573
Yong-go feels bad about...

501
00:37:58,951 --> 00:37:59,952
Punk.

502
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:08,627
Hey, where are you going again?

503
00:38:10,421 --> 00:38:11,504
You see, Chief.

504
00:38:11,588 --> 00:38:16,051
That boy is the exact opposite
of the type we're looking for.

505
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:19,721
Dragging in suspects like that
is a waste of time, so...

506
00:38:19,805 --> 00:38:20,848
Inspector Seo!

507
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:25,519
Have some meat before you speak.

508
00:38:30,983 --> 00:38:32,735
I don't eat burnt meat.

509
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:36,655
<i>When the Spring flower blooms</i>

510
00:38:36,739 --> 00:38:40,408
<i>You said you'd come back to me</i>

511
00:38:40,492 --> 00:38:45,998
<i>Like the singing swallows</i>

512
00:38:47,708 --> 00:38:50,335
<i>On the hills</i>

513
00:38:50,419 --> 00:38:53,630
<i>Singing birds and blooming flowers...</i>

514
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:04,767
Sir?

515
00:39:08,729 --> 00:39:12,816
<i>Alone on the hill</i>

516
00:39:14,068 --> 00:39:15,694
Hey, Seoul city bumpkin.

517
00:39:18,572 --> 00:39:19,573
What?

518
00:39:20,949 --> 00:39:22,742
Why did you come here?

519
00:39:22,826 --> 00:39:26,580
Out to the boondocks? Huh?

520
00:39:29,374 --> 00:39:30,876
To catch the killer.

521
00:39:36,381 --> 00:39:38,175
Is Seoul that big?

522
00:39:39,426 --> 00:39:40,803
Huh? Is it big?

523
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,598
Bigger than America?

524
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:49,812
Give me a banana.

525
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:54,983
Let me tell you about America.

526
00:39:57,486 --> 00:39:59,822
They've got the FBI!

527
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:03,992
If you watch how they investigate...
You know how?

528
00:40:07,246 --> 00:40:09,665
Their heads are spinning like a top.

529
00:40:10,958 --> 00:40:12,668
Analyzing things...

530
00:40:14,169 --> 00:40:15,504
You know why?

531
00:40:16,505 --> 00:40:19,967
It's cause they got so much fucking land!

532
00:40:22,094 --> 00:40:27,098
If you don't use your brain,
it's too much ground to cover.

533
00:40:27,182 --> 00:40:31,979
So they have no choice,
those FBI bastards.

534
00:40:33,105 --> 00:40:36,233
But our Republic of Korea...

535
00:40:38,735 --> 00:40:42,990
using just your two legs,
you can run all over it.

536
00:40:43,824 --> 00:40:44,992
You know why?

537
00:40:46,201 --> 00:40:48,829
Cause our land's the size of my dick.

538
00:40:49,413 --> 00:40:55,418
So it's said, Korean detectives
investigate with their feet.

539
00:40:55,502 --> 00:40:59,131
That's folk wisdom, you bastard.

540
00:40:59,548 --> 00:41:03,343
So brainy geeks like you
can go the hell to America.

541
00:41:03,427 --> 00:41:07,347
- Go there and...
- Shut your fucking mouth!

542
00:41:09,892 --> 00:41:11,351
You bastard!

543
00:41:12,686 --> 00:41:15,272
- Let go of me!
- What? You f...

544
00:41:23,572 --> 00:41:24,948
Give him this.

545
00:41:29,453 --> 00:41:31,997
Take it away! Take it!

546
00:41:39,671 --> 00:41:44,009
Everything's clearer now.
That's much better.

547
00:41:46,511 --> 00:41:49,890
I've got it now. About the killer.

548
00:41:50,766 --> 00:41:52,893
That bastard,

549
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:56,063
he'll do it again.

550
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,815
The next night it rains.

551
00:41:59,441 --> 00:42:03,612
So we need to keep one step ahead of him.

552
00:42:04,196 --> 00:42:06,990
Preemptive! Okay?

553
00:42:09,451 --> 00:42:13,830
And if you two ever start
fighting in front of me again,

554
00:42:13,914 --> 00:42:17,376
I'll kill you both! Understood?

555
00:42:32,724 --> 00:42:34,350
Ladies and gentlemen!

556
00:42:34,434 --> 00:42:37,478
In just a moment,
our President will be driving past.

557
00:42:37,562 --> 00:42:39,314
Wait a minute...

558
00:42:59,876 --> 00:43:01,795
It's raining nice.

559
00:43:03,463 --> 00:43:04,589
You ready?

560
00:43:40,667 --> 00:43:44,420
Ooh, Gwi-ok's looking nice!

561
00:43:44,504 --> 00:43:45,714
Shut up.

562
00:43:48,592 --> 00:43:51,636
What if he grabs her for real?

563
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:57,850
Inspector Seo should be
following close behind her.

564
00:43:57,934 --> 00:44:03,982
Shit, do we have to do this
every time when it rains?

565
00:44:04,608 --> 00:44:09,279
But thanks to this,
Gwi-OK puts on that red skirt.

566
00:44:09,363 --> 00:44:12,616
With makeup,
she looks like a different person.

567
00:44:13,325 --> 00:44:15,118
- So what?
- Was she always that pretty?

568
00:44:15,202 --> 00:44:16,244
You getting hard?

569
00:44:16,328 --> 00:44:18,371
- Wait, what are you doing?
- Let's check.

570
00:44:18,455 --> 00:44:20,290
- We're on duty now...
- Oh, Yong-go!

571
00:44:29,466 --> 00:44:30,467
Hey.

572
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,762
So do you really keep watch here?

573
00:44:35,055 --> 00:44:37,641
These days, nobody ever goes outside.

574
00:44:39,893 --> 00:44:41,353
Someone's coming.

575
00:44:42,729 --> 00:44:44,898
Hey, kids! Hey, kids!

576
00:44:46,817 --> 00:44:47,901
Over here.

577
00:44:50,862 --> 00:44:52,197
That's cold.

578
00:44:52,614 --> 00:44:53,990
You're so wet!

579
00:44:57,327 --> 00:45:00,622
Hey, stay here until the rain stops.

580
00:45:01,832 --> 00:45:03,333
That umbrella's useless.

581
00:45:03,417 --> 00:45:05,767
And we just picked it up
in front of the school.

582
00:45:06,128 --> 00:45:08,130
Someone threw it away.

583
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:11,007
Miss, are you going that way too?

584
00:45:11,091 --> 00:45:13,009
Hey, she's a detective.

585
00:45:13,093 --> 00:45:14,594
No way!

586
00:45:14,678 --> 00:45:17,013
She's in the Violent Crimes Division.

587
00:45:17,097 --> 00:45:18,931
- Really?
- Sure.

588
00:45:19,015 --> 00:45:21,726
Wait a minute. We'll give you a ride.

589
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:23,728
Wow, in a police car!

590
00:45:23,812 --> 00:45:28,941
Hey, you two.
What are you doing out so late?

591
00:45:29,025 --> 00:45:31,570
We always stay together, so it's okay.

592
00:45:32,821 --> 00:45:35,115
You'll be fine even if you go alone.

593
00:45:37,951 --> 00:45:41,704
Nam-ju, tell them about
what you heard at school.

594
00:45:41,788 --> 00:45:42,789
What?

595
00:45:42,873 --> 00:45:45,625
You know, during cleaning time,
about the murderer.

596
00:45:45,709 --> 00:45:49,587
Right! You know why
they can't catch the murderer?

597
00:45:49,671 --> 00:45:52,715
This is the truth.
We go to Ansong Girls Middle School.

598
00:45:52,799 --> 00:45:54,759
Behind our school, there's an outhouse.

599
00:45:54,843 --> 00:45:58,846
They say a crazy man lives under there,
the murderer!

600
00:45:58,930 --> 00:46:00,223
He stays there all day,

601
00:46:00,307 --> 00:46:03,518
and when night comes,
he sneaks out and kills women.

602
00:46:04,978 --> 00:46:06,938
So when he comes out at night,

603
00:46:07,022 --> 00:46:10,859
you must be able to smell
the shit from miles away.

604
00:46:12,861 --> 00:46:14,112
That's not the story.

605
00:46:14,196 --> 00:46:17,573
Yoo-jin said a crazy woman
fell in there and died.

606
00:46:17,657 --> 00:46:20,607
Then I'll meet you in front of the factory
with an umbrella.

607
00:46:22,412 --> 00:46:24,539
It's okay.

608
00:46:25,874 --> 00:46:27,000
Okay.

609
00:46:27,626 --> 00:46:30,795
I'll see you soon.

610
00:46:39,888 --> 00:46:46,888
<i>Stand by me, don't leave me</i>

611
00:46:47,854 --> 00:46:53,944
<i>I still love you</i>

612
00:46:55,195 --> 00:46:59,366
<i>Walking by myself...</i>

613
00:48:47,474 --> 00:48:48,516
Hello?

614
00:48:51,394 --> 00:48:53,813
Everyone stay where you are!

615
00:48:54,481 --> 00:48:58,943
Don't touch anything near you.
Don't move one step!

616
00:48:59,361 --> 00:49:00,736
Hey, you!

617
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:02,113
I'm talking to you!

618
00:49:02,197 --> 00:49:04,574
Wait for the forensics team.

619
00:49:16,711 --> 00:49:17,712
Look!

620
00:49:18,129 --> 00:49:20,715
These are genuine footprints.

621
00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:25,553
You see the Remicon factory there?

622
00:49:25,637 --> 00:49:29,391
He caught her near the factory,

623
00:49:30,016 --> 00:49:33,561
and quietly pulled her
over 400 meters to here.

624
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:39,818
The footprints look
like a bride and groom's.

625
00:49:41,194 --> 00:49:46,199
But you didn't find anything,
aside from the footprints?

626
00:49:47,867 --> 00:49:52,330
I hoped to find fingerprints
on the umbrella, but no luck.

627
00:49:52,872 --> 00:49:57,669
Not only that, due to the rain,
the footprints are all smudged.

628
00:49:59,713 --> 00:50:02,716
Even after such a thorough investigation,
nothing.

629
00:50:06,678 --> 00:50:11,057
Therefore, Chief,
I think this could be a hint. Hint!

630
00:50:11,558 --> 00:50:12,850
What?

631
00:50:12,934 --> 00:50:17,564
The fact that we found nothing
at the scene.

632
00:50:19,566 --> 00:50:21,693
Always in rape cases,

633
00:50:22,110 --> 00:50:24,695
at the crime scene,

634
00:50:24,779 --> 00:50:29,158
there's one or two
of those hairs left behind.

635
00:50:29,242 --> 00:50:30,660
So?

636
00:50:31,202 --> 00:50:37,124
I'm saying the criminal
must not have any hair down there.

637
00:50:37,208 --> 00:50:39,001
You mean hairless?

638
00:50:39,085 --> 00:50:43,214
That's right, hairless. A total baldy.

639
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:50,221
He can't leave hair behind,
because he doesn't have any?

640
00:50:50,805 --> 00:50:52,140
For example,

641
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:56,602
a Buddhist monk
who shaved the hair down there.

642
00:50:56,686 --> 00:50:58,146
It's a perfect crime.

643
00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:00,023
Well, then.

644
00:51:00,982 --> 00:51:04,860
Yongdeok Temple is just next door.

645
00:51:04,944 --> 00:51:06,571
Should we start there?

646
00:51:14,162 --> 00:51:18,041
Hey, Gwi-OK,
you've got the radio on over there.

647
00:51:19,876 --> 00:51:22,211
How would you like your coffee?

648
00:51:22,295 --> 00:51:24,255
Lots of sugar for me.

649
00:51:25,256 --> 00:51:27,759
- Inspector Seo!
- Yes, sir?

650
00:51:28,259 --> 00:51:31,221
Do you have any more ideas?

651
00:51:32,222 --> 00:51:37,018
I don't know. As you saw today,
this criminal is flawless.

652
00:51:37,602 --> 00:51:39,770
- So?
- Therefore,

653
00:51:39,854 --> 00:51:43,023
our standard procedures
aren't going to help.

654
00:51:43,107 --> 00:51:46,110
So what are we going to do?

655
00:51:48,112 --> 00:51:49,447
Jesus...

656
00:51:49,531 --> 00:51:52,867
Excuse me,
but I've got something to show you.

657
00:51:55,995 --> 00:51:59,290
What will she show us today?

658
00:52:01,668 --> 00:52:02,877
What's this?

659
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:06,714
These are documents
from an FM radio station.

660
00:52:06,798 --> 00:52:09,717
Looks like a broadcast schedule.

661
00:52:09,801 --> 00:52:13,680
Yes, it's an evening music program
I listen to.

662
00:52:14,222 --> 00:52:19,227
There's someone who keeps requesting
the song "Sad Letter."

663
00:52:19,686 --> 00:52:22,814
If you look, it lists the dates
this song was broadcast.

664
00:52:23,565 --> 00:52:27,902
Actually, this isn't a very popular song.
It's quite rare.

665
00:52:27,986 --> 00:52:29,612
A song? What letter?

666
00:52:29,696 --> 00:52:33,032
"Sad Letter." The singer is Yoo Jae-ha.

667
00:52:34,617 --> 00:52:36,160
Jo Young-pil's band.

668
00:52:36,244 --> 00:52:38,538
- Sure, I heard it.
- So?

669
00:52:40,707 --> 00:52:46,045
The song was broadcast
on the same days of the murders here.

670
00:52:49,007 --> 00:52:50,049
Look.

671
00:52:50,967 --> 00:52:53,886
October 20. That's Park Bo-hee's murder.

672
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:58,725
December 19 was Lee Hyang-sook.

673
00:52:59,601 --> 00:53:04,981
So... on last night's murder too,
this song was broadcast?

674
00:53:05,481 --> 00:53:08,276
Yes. I listened to it myself.

675
00:53:09,402 --> 00:53:12,780
The DJ read out the postcard
containing the request.

676
00:53:13,865 --> 00:53:16,993
"Sent by a lonely man
from Terung District.

677
00:53:17,493 --> 00:53:19,996
Please broadcast it on a rainy day."

678
00:53:23,416 --> 00:53:26,210
Miss Kwon, nice! Good idea!

679
00:53:27,086 --> 00:53:29,631
You read too many mystery novels
as a student?

680
00:53:30,590 --> 00:53:32,759
That was a nice story.

681
00:53:34,177 --> 00:53:39,265
Chief, this can't be a coincidence.
Look at this. Documents never lie.

682
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:42,434
Christ, here we go again.

683
00:53:42,518 --> 00:53:45,772
It seems he's a real psycho.

684
00:53:46,522 --> 00:53:49,108
As soon as he hears the song,
he goes crazy.

685
00:53:49,192 --> 00:53:53,612
Oh, Chief, now you're doing it too.
This makes no sense!

686
00:53:53,696 --> 00:53:56,490
It does make sense, sir!
It's quite simple.

687
00:53:56,574 --> 00:54:00,953
Assemblies start with the National Anthem.
It's the same.

688
00:54:01,037 --> 00:54:02,955
Did you get the postcard?

689
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:05,333
I requested it,

690
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:08,211
but the radio station's
a bit disorganized.

691
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:12,256
Find it quickly.

692
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:15,134
Check the postmark,
fingerprints and handwriting.

693
00:54:15,218 --> 00:54:16,343
Yes, sir!

694
00:54:16,427 --> 00:54:20,139
Officer Kwon,
call the station and follow up on this.

695
00:54:26,354 --> 00:54:27,563
Baldies!

696
00:54:28,231 --> 00:54:30,608
- What about that?
- Huh?

697
00:54:30,692 --> 00:54:32,902
What we mentioned before...

698
00:54:32,986 --> 00:54:34,237
Hairless, sir!

699
00:54:34,696 --> 00:54:36,739
How do you investigate?

700
00:54:36,823 --> 00:54:39,784
Pull the pants off passing men?

701
00:54:52,422 --> 00:54:56,967
The postcard from yesterday.
I asked you to keep it!

702
00:54:57,051 --> 00:54:59,136
What postcard?

703
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:01,221
You read it on the air yesterday!

704
00:55:01,305 --> 00:55:03,016
Look how many we get here!

705
00:55:05,643 --> 00:55:06,644
Hey, mister!

706
00:55:08,104 --> 00:55:09,856
Nothing. Get dressed.

707
00:55:12,066 --> 00:55:13,067
Inspector.

708
00:55:13,693 --> 00:55:16,987
They've already
carted off yesterday's trash.

709
00:55:17,071 --> 00:55:19,073
It's no use.

710
00:55:33,796 --> 00:55:36,007
You're not going to shower?

711
00:55:38,134 --> 00:55:39,802
Enough showers, for God's sake.

712
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:44,766
My skin feels like it'll burst.

713
00:55:45,767 --> 00:55:48,186
You couldn't find any hairless men?

714
00:55:50,897 --> 00:55:54,484
Like looking for dog's horns.
Just paid sauna fees.

715
00:55:54,901 --> 00:55:57,445
Shit, can't even get reimbursed.

716
00:55:57,862 --> 00:56:00,656
At least your face is clean.

717
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:05,912
How many times in a day...
dressing, undressing, dressing...

718
00:56:06,829 --> 00:56:08,456
I'll lose my hair there too.

719
00:56:14,295 --> 00:56:18,298
I asked the workers at the sauna there

720
00:56:18,382 --> 00:56:20,259
to call me if they saw anyone.

721
00:56:20,343 --> 00:56:24,597
Bastards just smirked at me.

722
00:56:26,599 --> 00:56:30,186
Don't do it all yourself,
have someone else do it.

723
00:56:33,689 --> 00:56:37,485
What's that guy from Seoul
doing these days?

724
00:56:39,821 --> 00:56:43,199
- Researching pop songs.
- What?

725
00:56:44,283 --> 00:56:46,410
Shit, it's nothing you've heard of.

726
00:56:46,869 --> 00:56:49,205
Is he still talking nonsense?

727
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:51,457
Driving me crazy.

728
00:56:53,459 --> 00:56:57,171
If you feel that way, go see a shaman.

729
00:56:58,798 --> 00:56:59,799
A shaman?

730
00:57:00,383 --> 00:57:03,803
Sure, one that tells fortunes well.

731
00:57:04,387 --> 00:57:08,724
Ask her where the murderer is hiding.

732
00:57:16,482 --> 00:57:18,882
A problem at the main gate
of the police station.

733
00:57:19,652 --> 00:57:23,823
It should be moved about
10 meters to the southwest.

734
00:57:26,284 --> 00:57:30,413
A face just passed by me.
I think he's the one.

735
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:41,591
Is his face among these pictures here?

736
00:57:42,633 --> 00:57:45,553
Take those dirty photos away.

737
00:57:46,137 --> 00:57:48,848
- Hey, just look...
- Put them away!

738
00:57:50,558 --> 00:57:52,268
It's bad fortune.

739
00:57:55,062 --> 00:58:00,318
- Take this, and do what I say.
- Don't try to sell that charm.

740
00:58:19,045 --> 00:58:21,464
Wait, wait a minute.

741
00:58:25,509 --> 00:58:28,429
You have to mix in dirt
from the crime scene.

742
00:58:29,430 --> 00:58:30,514
Stir.

743
00:58:31,891 --> 00:58:33,559
She said that was most important.

744
00:58:35,061 --> 00:58:36,270
Now pour it.

745
00:58:41,275 --> 00:58:42,276
Stop.

746
00:58:44,904 --> 00:58:46,405
Good.

747
00:58:53,829 --> 00:58:55,914
Once this dries,

748
00:58:55,998 --> 00:59:00,753
this stain will form
the shape of the murderer's face.

749
00:59:01,212 --> 00:59:02,880
That's ridiculous.

750
00:59:02,964 --> 00:59:04,965
Quiet, you'll break the charm.

751
00:59:05,049 --> 00:59:06,717
Know how much this costs?

752
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:08,970
So shut up!

753
00:59:15,935 --> 00:59:17,019
Who's that?

754
00:59:19,522 --> 00:59:20,856
You've heard?

755
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:24,026
Criminals always return
to the crime scene.

756
00:59:59,020 --> 01:00:00,396
Wait a sec.

757
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:03,065
What the...

758
01:00:04,442 --> 01:00:06,027
What's he doing here?

759
01:00:06,444 --> 01:00:07,820
Why'd he come?

760
01:00:23,586 --> 01:00:25,379
What the fuck...

761
01:00:26,797 --> 01:00:29,508
We need science here!

762
01:00:32,219 --> 01:00:34,055
What the hell's that?

763
01:00:40,519 --> 01:00:42,772
Still, he's got style.

764
01:03:19,553 --> 01:03:20,971
Stop there!

765
01:03:24,266 --> 01:03:25,684
Hey, you!

766
01:03:36,237 --> 01:03:39,782
It's getting narrow! Single file!

767
01:04:03,722 --> 01:04:06,725
Miss, did a strange man
just run past here?

768
01:04:06,809 --> 01:04:07,810
No.

769
01:04:09,270 --> 01:04:12,147
- It's that policeman.
- What?

770
01:04:12,231 --> 01:04:14,900
- At the guard post.
- You know him?

771
01:04:15,734 --> 01:04:19,071
Damn, he's a fast little bastard.

772
01:04:21,156 --> 01:04:23,742
He's not there?

773
01:04:26,620 --> 01:04:29,664
Did you check the alleys properly?

774
01:04:29,748 --> 01:04:31,875
You think you know this village?

775
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:34,377
You stepped on a stick back there.

776
01:04:34,461 --> 01:04:37,339
A stick or a shit pile, who cares?

777
01:04:37,423 --> 01:04:39,550
He stepped on it.

778
01:04:45,973 --> 01:04:46,974
What?

779
01:04:47,766 --> 01:04:49,560
Over there... Hey, you!

780
01:05:00,821 --> 01:05:01,822
Stop!

781
01:05:09,038 --> 01:05:11,206
Jesus, not again.

782
01:05:14,293 --> 01:05:15,461
Hey, over there.

783
01:05:44,198 --> 01:05:47,492
Black clothes, black clothes...

784
01:05:47,576 --> 01:05:49,578
Everyone's in black except you.

785
01:06:00,839 --> 01:06:02,424
Everybody stop!

786
01:06:05,844 --> 01:06:08,305
Don't move an inch!

787
01:06:32,287 --> 01:06:34,081
- Inspector Jo!
- Yes?

788
01:06:35,874 --> 01:06:37,418
Gather them together.

789
01:06:40,421 --> 01:06:42,130
Hey, stop.

790
01:06:42,214 --> 01:06:44,216
Gather together.

791
01:06:44,925 --> 01:06:46,593
Lift up your heads.

792
01:06:47,302 --> 01:06:48,679
Everyone stand in line.

793
01:07:05,612 --> 01:07:07,573
Look in my eyes.

794
01:07:09,867 --> 01:07:11,702
Give me that.

795
01:07:24,173 --> 01:07:26,300
What is it?

796
01:07:29,303 --> 01:07:31,764
- You bastard!
- Out of my way.

797
01:07:33,140 --> 01:07:37,186
You ran away from us?

798
01:07:59,833 --> 01:08:05,339
But... is jerking off a crime?

799
01:08:05,964 --> 01:08:07,257
It's not a crime.

800
01:08:07,966 --> 01:08:09,968
Why'd you run away?

801
01:08:10,427 --> 01:08:13,847
Someone jumped out of the woods
and ran at me,

802
01:08:14,681 --> 01:08:16,391
so I panicked.

803
01:08:16,475 --> 01:08:21,187
Sure, but why'd you go
all the way out there to do it?

804
01:08:21,271 --> 01:08:23,899
There are kids at home,

805
01:08:24,817 --> 01:08:28,236
and the air's nice in the woods.

806
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:32,741
Or did you go back
to fantasize about the dead girls?

807
01:08:35,369 --> 01:08:41,500
Your husband likes
to go out at night, huh?

808
01:08:42,668 --> 01:08:43,669
What's this?

809
01:08:45,003 --> 01:08:46,004
Gimme that.

810
01:08:50,467 --> 01:08:52,094
What did you make these with?

811
01:09:07,693 --> 01:09:10,361
These days, you know,

812
01:09:10,445 --> 01:09:16,159
real events in our town
are stronger than the magazines.

813
01:09:16,827 --> 01:09:21,831
When I read the newspaper,
I start fantasizing.

814
01:09:21,915 --> 01:09:24,751
I ask myself why I do this,

815
01:09:24,835 --> 01:09:27,129
but when will this chance come again?

816
01:09:30,757 --> 01:09:32,843
According to neighbors,

817
01:09:33,385 --> 01:09:36,304
he looks diligently after his sick wife,

818
01:09:36,388 --> 01:09:38,515
never misses a week at church,

819
01:09:38,599 --> 01:09:40,976
that he's honest.

820
01:09:42,769 --> 01:09:46,565
All perverts are like that.
Nice on the outside.

821
01:09:47,149 --> 01:09:49,067
But my eyes can't be fooled.

822
01:09:50,277 --> 01:09:52,404
One look, and I know.

823
01:09:55,782 --> 01:09:59,577
Honey, I put socks in here.
Change them after dinner.

824
01:09:59,661 --> 01:10:04,666
- Don't forget, or they'll smell.
- I'll take care of it. Go feed the kids.

825
01:10:05,083 --> 01:10:08,003
Watch out for protesters.

826
01:10:08,420 --> 01:10:12,549
Release Jo Byung-soon!

827
01:10:12,966 --> 01:10:16,302
- What now?
- I heard Byung-soon confessed last night.

828
01:10:16,386 --> 01:10:19,598
- Who says so?
- Oh, Chief!

829
01:10:23,769 --> 01:10:25,812
When will you make an announcement?

830
01:10:25,896 --> 01:10:29,023
We know nothing. Just wait a bit more.

831
01:10:29,107 --> 01:10:31,693
You've held him four days
without a warrant.

832
01:10:31,777 --> 01:10:34,071
People are saying he's detained illegally.

833
01:10:34,780 --> 01:10:38,825
This time be realistic, like in a movie.

834
01:10:40,911 --> 01:10:41,912
Go!

835
01:10:42,829 --> 01:10:44,581
You did a good job just now.

836
01:10:44,665 --> 01:10:45,791
Yong-go?

837
01:10:49,628 --> 01:10:53,548
So, you were hiding behind the outhouse,

838
01:10:54,132 --> 01:10:56,509
and you saw Park Myung-ja

839
01:10:56,593 --> 01:10:59,762
coming towards you
with a flashlight, right?

840
01:10:59,846 --> 01:11:02,933
Yes, yes, yes. It seems so.

841
01:11:04,935 --> 01:11:07,562
Not it seems, you bastard, be precise!

842
01:11:12,943 --> 01:11:14,861
I think I dreamed it that way.

843
01:11:15,570 --> 01:11:20,325
Anyway, I snuck up behind her,

844
01:11:20,826 --> 01:11:27,826
and I must have chopped
the back of her neck?

845
01:11:29,042 --> 01:11:31,378
- With my hand like this.
- Next?

846
01:11:32,629 --> 01:11:37,759
Myung-ja cried out,
and I guess she collapsed?

847
01:11:37,843 --> 01:11:43,556
So I laid her on the ground,
and was about to take her...

848
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:47,102
Hey, it didn't happen there, it was...

849
01:11:50,230 --> 01:11:52,732
The pine grove! I took her there.

850
01:11:52,816 --> 01:11:55,985
It was from the rice paddies
to the pine grove.

851
01:11:56,069 --> 01:11:59,989
According to the news,
more than 200 meters, right?

852
01:12:00,073 --> 01:12:01,783
That's so far!

853
01:12:01,867 --> 01:12:05,703
So the rain was pouring,
and I dragged her through the mud.

854
01:12:05,787 --> 01:12:07,706
And then?

855
01:12:08,498 --> 01:12:11,001
So I threw her down in the pine grove.

856
01:12:11,626 --> 01:12:14,128
Then I strangled her.

857
01:12:14,212 --> 01:12:16,631
- With what?
- The bag strap.

858
01:12:16,715 --> 01:12:17,716
Really?

859
01:12:18,133 --> 01:12:19,384
Her stocking!

860
01:12:22,512 --> 01:12:24,138
Right.

861
01:12:24,222 --> 01:12:27,392
A brassiere! A Venus brassiere.

862
01:12:27,976 --> 01:12:34,649
I wrapped it around her throat like this,

863
01:12:35,650 --> 01:12:36,902
so the woman,

864
01:12:37,486 --> 01:12:42,782
she took a rock
and clocked me in the head.

865
01:12:42,866 --> 01:12:44,034
Where'd she hit you?

866
01:12:45,243 --> 01:12:47,746
Right here, next to my eye.

867
01:12:50,123 --> 01:12:54,878
It still hurts,
even if it was just a dream.

868
01:13:05,472 --> 01:13:06,556
Byung-soon?

869
01:13:07,349 --> 01:13:09,767
Are you gonna keep saying it was a dream?

870
01:13:09,851 --> 01:13:13,980
That's enough. Turn your head.

871
01:13:14,064 --> 01:13:16,315
So this bruise is from the rock?

872
01:13:16,399 --> 01:13:18,985
- No, this guy here...
- Shut up! Look here.

873
01:13:23,281 --> 01:13:27,410
You've done well, now let's finish this.

874
01:13:30,247 --> 01:13:35,752
So... since she hit me like this
with the rock,

875
01:13:35,836 --> 01:13:37,712
I must have lost consciousness?

876
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:43,676
And after lying there a while,
I woke up, and looking around...

877
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:45,053
And?

878
01:13:45,137 --> 01:13:49,141
I was in the bottom of an outhouse!
A shithouse!

879
01:13:50,225 --> 01:13:54,437
And maggots were creeping
all over the place!

880
01:13:54,521 --> 01:13:58,399
- Not the outhouse again.
- So after brushing them off,

881
01:13:58,483 --> 01:14:02,945
I grabbed some straw,
and pulled myself up.

882
01:14:03,029 --> 01:14:05,865
Even in a dream, it's hard.

883
01:14:05,949 --> 01:14:07,784
But then I saw,

884
01:14:07,868 --> 01:14:12,414
this wasn't someone's home,
it was a school toilet.

885
01:14:13,415 --> 01:14:15,333
Walking to the playground,

886
01:14:15,417 --> 01:14:19,128
I saw huge swarms of girls,

887
01:14:19,212 --> 01:14:21,339
so many, and the smell...

888
01:14:21,423 --> 01:14:23,633
Wait! Over here.

889
01:14:27,596 --> 01:14:30,724
Where did you hear about
that school outhouse?

890
01:14:31,558 --> 01:14:34,144
Everyone knows that story.

891
01:14:35,020 --> 01:14:36,688
I saw it in a dream.

892
01:14:39,149 --> 01:14:43,277
From below the gas attack,
run in a direction

893
01:14:43,361 --> 01:14:45,863
perpendicular to the wind.

894
01:14:45,947 --> 01:14:48,366
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.

895
01:14:48,450 --> 01:14:50,660
Put it down. Hey!

896
01:15:00,462 --> 01:15:02,255
Pretend you're dead!

897
01:15:06,509 --> 01:15:10,847
Last time, who told you that story
about the outhouse?

898
01:15:10,931 --> 01:15:12,682
You came because of that?

899
01:15:17,812 --> 01:15:18,980
What's wrong?

900
01:15:19,064 --> 01:15:23,401
I hurt myself in the chute.
There was a pebble in there.

901
01:15:24,819 --> 01:15:26,238
Where's the nurse?

902
01:15:28,406 --> 01:15:29,991
I'll put it on for you.

903
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:32,202
I'll do it.

904
01:15:33,495 --> 01:15:36,957
Shy? You're just a kid. Sit down.

905
01:15:40,961 --> 01:15:42,128
Give it to me.

906
01:15:44,839 --> 01:15:45,966
Lift up your shirt.

907
01:15:47,092 --> 01:15:50,637
Think about what I asked you.

908
01:15:53,431 --> 01:15:57,644
The murderer in the outhouse,
coming out at night...

909
01:15:58,270 --> 01:16:01,314
Who might have told that story first.

910
01:16:02,023 --> 01:16:03,357
How would I know?

911
01:16:03,441 --> 01:16:08,238
It's like asking who made up
the elephant jokes.

912
01:16:10,448 --> 01:16:13,285
Why don't you go to the outhouse yourself?

913
01:16:13,827 --> 01:16:17,205
Do I look like I have time for that?

914
01:17:07,964 --> 01:17:09,757
Even still,

915
01:17:09,841 --> 01:17:12,843
some kids talk,
so you snoop around the outhouse?

916
01:17:12,927 --> 01:17:14,512
You got that much time?

917
01:17:14,596 --> 01:17:17,348
- Giving me a heart attack.
- Investigating...

918
01:17:17,432 --> 01:17:18,600
What?

919
01:17:19,434 --> 01:17:21,728
Is investigating such a dirty job?

920
01:17:23,772 --> 01:17:28,068
Ah! Is that why they made up the rumor?

921
01:17:29,277 --> 01:17:32,280
I saw her myself once or twice.

922
01:17:32,364 --> 01:17:34,908
- That woman.
- Who?

923
01:17:35,950 --> 01:17:37,118
A crying woman.

924
01:17:38,411 --> 01:17:39,746
When was it?

925
01:17:41,539 --> 01:17:43,625
I was in the outhouse then too,

926
01:17:44,542 --> 01:17:46,753
when I heard a woman crying.

927
01:17:47,629 --> 01:17:49,214
When I came out,

928
01:17:50,131 --> 01:17:55,345
there was a woman working on that hill,
who kept crying.

929
01:17:57,263 --> 01:17:58,890
<i>A woman was crying?</i>

930
01:17:59,766 --> 01:18:00,767
<i>Yes.</i>

931
01:18:01,893 --> 01:18:03,895
<i>She kept crying on that hill.</i>

932
01:18:04,979 --> 01:18:06,564
<i>It just seemed strange.</i>

933
01:18:26,876 --> 01:18:28,128
Hello?

934
01:18:31,047 --> 01:18:32,132
Excuse me.

935
01:18:34,467 --> 01:18:36,511
Are you the person who lives here?

936
01:18:38,888 --> 01:18:40,098
Who are you?

937
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:45,603
I'd like to ask something. I heard that...

938
01:18:48,523 --> 01:18:49,816
Wait!

939
01:18:50,525 --> 01:18:52,193
Look here.

940
01:18:52,277 --> 01:18:54,946
- I'm a policeman.
- Really?

941
01:18:55,822 --> 01:18:59,742
You can't stay there. Someone might see.

942
01:19:01,786 --> 01:19:03,413
There's no one here.

943
01:19:08,293 --> 01:19:11,045
Go, please. I beg you.

944
01:19:23,099 --> 01:19:26,436
Be assured this will remain a secret.

945
01:19:28,021 --> 01:19:29,939
As we're both women

946
01:19:31,441 --> 01:19:34,360
tell me everything comfortably
and in detail.

947
01:19:39,407 --> 01:19:40,783
That night...

948
01:19:46,456 --> 01:19:48,958
a light rain was falling.

949
01:19:49,792 --> 01:19:51,085
When was it?

950
01:19:53,671 --> 01:19:54,964
It was...

951
01:19:59,135 --> 01:20:00,678
last September.

952
01:20:10,772 --> 01:20:13,191
I had read all the articles...

953
01:20:15,193 --> 01:20:17,362
about the women killed.

954
01:20:20,198 --> 01:20:24,702
The methods he used were exactly the same.

955
01:20:26,538 --> 01:20:27,747
It was...

956
01:20:30,833 --> 01:20:32,001
the same with me.

957
01:20:38,633 --> 01:20:40,176
You saw his face?

958
01:20:40,843 --> 01:20:42,512
I tried not to on purpose

959
01:20:43,555 --> 01:20:45,265
keeping my chin down.

960
01:20:47,225 --> 01:20:49,018
My panties covered my head,

961
01:20:50,270 --> 01:20:52,021
but I closed my eyes tight.

962
01:20:53,648 --> 01:20:57,235
If I saw him, he'd have killed me.

963
01:21:00,363 --> 01:21:04,033
I don't know about the rest,
but one thing I remember.

964
01:21:05,201 --> 01:21:07,036
His hands were very soft.

965
01:21:08,329 --> 01:21:12,792
The hand over my mouth was delicate,

966
01:21:13,334 --> 01:21:14,460
just like a woman's.

967
01:21:48,494 --> 01:21:51,539
We're done.
Let's get ourselves some sleep.

968
01:21:52,123 --> 01:21:54,876
Once we get your seal, it's done.

969
01:21:56,878 --> 01:21:58,296
It's all as you said.

970
01:21:59,672 --> 01:22:00,798
Sound good?

971
01:22:00,882 --> 01:22:04,009
Yes, of course.

972
01:22:04,093 --> 01:22:07,137
Oh, it's finally over, right?

973
01:22:07,221 --> 01:22:09,223
Please let me down. Please.

974
01:22:15,688 --> 01:22:17,856
Let him go. He's not the murderer.

975
01:22:17,940 --> 01:22:18,941
What?

976
01:22:20,109 --> 01:22:22,653
Byung-soon, are you the murderer?

977
01:22:22,737 --> 01:22:24,738
Yes, sir, yes...

978
01:22:24,822 --> 01:22:26,949
Shut up. No, you're not.

979
01:22:27,033 --> 01:22:28,576
I think I am...

980
01:22:28,660 --> 01:22:29,911
Let him go!

981
01:22:31,746 --> 01:22:33,956
Write down everything she said...

982
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:35,040
Hey!

983
01:22:35,124 --> 01:22:37,334
You toying with me?

984
01:22:37,418 --> 01:22:39,837
Are you having fun?

985
01:22:39,921 --> 01:22:42,798
I caught the murderer, okay?

986
01:22:42,882 --> 01:22:45,176
What do you mean, you caught him?

987
01:22:48,638 --> 01:22:53,225
- Did you hang him from the ceiling?
- Well, he kept lying, and...

988
01:22:53,309 --> 01:22:56,061
Get hold of yourself. Those journalists...

989
01:22:56,145 --> 01:22:59,232
- Chief!
- Those goddamned bastards!

990
01:23:03,486 --> 01:23:05,571
Stop!

991
01:23:07,407 --> 01:23:08,574
Listen.

992
01:23:11,411 --> 01:23:12,412
What is that?

993
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:16,582
- Is it live?
- It's being broadcast now?

994
01:23:16,666 --> 01:23:18,084
Yes, it's live.

995
01:23:27,427 --> 01:23:30,888
First, declare a state of emergency.

996
01:23:31,305 --> 01:23:34,434
And send me two garrisons of men.

997
01:23:35,017 --> 01:23:37,437
Because our intelligence says so!

998
01:23:38,396 --> 01:23:41,815
Tonight. There'll be a murder tonight.

999
01:23:41,899 --> 01:23:44,693
Hello, I need to speak to producer Im...

1000
01:23:44,777 --> 01:23:46,904
What? He quit?

1001
01:23:47,739 --> 01:23:49,073
Get me the AD now.

1002
01:23:50,324 --> 01:23:53,410
The song that was just played,
"Sad Letter."

1003
01:23:53,494 --> 01:23:55,913
Read the name and address
of the requester.

1004
01:23:56,414 --> 01:23:58,124
You must have the postcard.

1005
01:23:59,333 --> 01:24:00,710
What? Prank call?

1006
01:24:01,252 --> 01:24:04,254
It's the police, bastard! Hello?

1007
01:24:04,338 --> 01:24:05,673
I'll go myself.

1008
01:24:06,632 --> 01:24:08,717
Are the garrisons coming?

1009
01:24:08,801 --> 01:24:10,887
They don't even have one man available.

1010
01:24:12,346 --> 01:24:16,517
They went to suppress
a demonstration in Suwon city.

1011
01:24:48,966 --> 01:24:51,803
Name: Ahn Mi-seon, age 28.

1012
01:24:53,763 --> 01:24:59,477
Estimated time of death,
last night between 7:30 and 8:00.

1013
01:25:00,853 --> 01:25:06,442
When the two of you were fighting
like madmen. Right?

1014
01:25:09,487 --> 01:25:10,696
Wait a minute.

1015
01:25:13,032 --> 01:25:15,076
There's something in the vagina.

1016
01:25:27,922 --> 01:25:30,299
Looks like a peach.

1017
01:25:57,243 --> 01:25:58,661
Nine pieces.

1018
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:10,965
Do you see this kind of thing
in Seoul often?

1019
01:26:13,467 --> 01:26:14,468
Never.

1020
01:26:18,097 --> 01:26:19,724
You were right.

1021
01:26:20,141 --> 01:26:21,309
What?

1022
01:26:23,311 --> 01:26:28,566
These guys were a waste of time
from the start.

1023
01:26:30,902 --> 01:26:31,903
Hey!

1024
01:26:33,195 --> 01:26:34,989
A call from the radio station.

1025
01:26:35,406 --> 01:26:38,326
I think she found the postcard.

1026
01:26:40,244 --> 01:26:42,747
I've got the postcard. It has an address.

1027
01:26:43,331 --> 01:26:44,832
Can you write it down?

1028
01:26:45,583 --> 01:26:50,630
Jinan 1-ri, Terung District #32.
Park Hyun-gyu.

1029
01:27:25,456 --> 01:27:26,499
Who are you?

1030
01:27:28,125 --> 01:27:31,545
We're policemen.
Where has Park Hyun-gyu gone?

1031
01:27:33,547 --> 01:27:36,258
He works at the factory at this time.

1032
01:28:01,575 --> 01:28:04,161
Hey, Hyun-gyu. Park Hyun-gyu!

1033
01:28:06,872 --> 01:28:08,290
Park Hyun-gyu!

1034
01:28:37,611 --> 01:28:38,904
Show me your hands.

1035
01:28:48,497 --> 01:28:50,624
They're quite smooth.

1036
01:28:53,002 --> 01:28:55,504
How long have you worked
in the factory office?

1037
01:28:59,258 --> 01:29:00,801
From September last year.

1038
01:29:02,553 --> 01:29:07,183
Then... a little before the first murder.

1039
01:29:11,228 --> 01:29:15,649
So after doing your military service,
you came to this town,

1040
01:29:16,150 --> 01:29:18,903
and the murders all began taking place.

1041
01:29:19,445 --> 01:29:20,446
Right?

1042
01:29:22,406 --> 01:29:24,075
Park Hyun-gyu.

1043
01:29:25,159 --> 01:29:27,203
You sent this postcard to the station.

1044
01:29:27,787 --> 01:29:29,037
Yes.

1045
01:29:29,121 --> 01:29:30,956
You sent several others too.

1046
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:32,666
Yes.

1047
01:29:33,292 --> 01:29:35,586
You asked it to be played on rainy days.

1048
01:29:36,378 --> 01:29:37,505
Yes.

1049
01:29:39,381 --> 01:29:40,841
"Sad Letter."

1050
01:29:41,967 --> 01:29:45,596
You know that each time this song played,
a woman was murdered?

1051
01:29:48,599 --> 01:29:49,809
No.

1052
01:29:52,311 --> 01:29:54,313
Look at the broadcast records.

1053
01:29:57,399 --> 01:29:58,526
Okay.

1054
01:29:59,985 --> 01:30:02,988
The song played yesterday? "Sad Letter."

1055
01:30:04,573 --> 01:30:05,574
Yes.

1056
01:30:05,658 --> 01:30:08,535
- You listened to the program?
- Yes.

1057
01:30:08,619 --> 01:30:12,748
Your song played at 7:08,
and the program finished at 8 p.m.

1058
01:30:12,832 --> 01:30:13,957
- You listened to the end?
- Yes.

1059
01:30:14,041 --> 01:30:15,959
- Continuously?
- Yes.

1060
01:30:16,043 --> 01:30:19,004
- What was the final song?
- I don't know.

1061
01:30:19,088 --> 01:30:21,048
- It was yesterday!
- I don't remember.

1062
01:30:21,132 --> 01:30:23,967
- Because you went out!
- I was home!

1063
01:30:24,051 --> 01:30:27,304
She was killed between 7:30 and 8:00 p.m.

1064
01:30:27,388 --> 01:30:29,931
You weren't listening, you went out!

1065
01:30:30,015 --> 01:30:31,475
Don't make me laugh.

1066
01:30:31,559 --> 01:30:34,770
- Yong-go!
- You motherfucker. Are you joking?

1067
01:30:34,854 --> 01:30:37,022
- Let go of him now!
- Hey!

1068
01:30:40,860 --> 01:30:41,986
Get back here!

1069
01:30:46,991 --> 01:30:52,454
Even kids in this town
know you torture innocent people.

1070
01:30:52,538 --> 01:30:55,332
- Shut up, you!
- Get back here!

1071
01:30:59,378 --> 01:31:01,130
Anyway, I won't be one of them.

1072
01:31:03,132 --> 01:31:04,550
Never.

1073
01:31:07,553 --> 01:31:09,471
Okay. Park Hyun-gyu.

1074
01:31:10,139 --> 01:31:14,059
You say you listened at home to the end?

1075
01:31:15,186 --> 01:31:18,606
But you couldn't have forgotten
the last song.

1076
01:31:19,148 --> 01:31:25,154
Because the DJ introduced it
with some very striking words.

1077
01:31:25,738 --> 01:31:29,408
She mentioned you,
and the many postcards you sent.

1078
01:31:30,242 --> 01:31:33,871
If you heard it,
you couldn't have forgotten.

1079
01:31:34,663 --> 01:31:37,541
Tell me
if you really listened to the end.

1080
01:31:39,001 --> 01:31:40,586
I don't remember.

1081
01:31:41,003 --> 01:31:42,338
You don't remember?

1082
01:31:43,589 --> 01:31:45,341
Should I explain it for you?

1083
01:31:49,094 --> 01:31:51,639
This is the recording
of yesterday's program.

1084
01:31:53,474 --> 01:31:56,894
Last night,
you sat listening to this song.

1085
01:31:58,312 --> 01:32:02,316
Outside the rain was pelting down,
you listened...

1086
01:32:04,652 --> 01:32:07,321
and soon you started
itching with excitement.

1087
01:32:08,322 --> 01:32:12,326
There's something you always do
when you hear this song.

1088
01:32:13,410 --> 01:32:17,831
You heard a TV program playing
in the room of your landlady,

1089
01:32:18,540 --> 01:32:23,754
you left the lights on in your own room
and crept outside.

1090
01:32:24,546 --> 01:32:29,218
And in the pitch dark,
you wandered here and there.

1091
01:32:30,302 --> 01:32:33,555
Who will it be today?

1092
01:32:34,932 --> 01:32:36,225
Right?

1093
01:32:38,060 --> 01:32:41,647
You hid in a reed field,
waiting for a woman to pass.

1094
01:32:42,356 --> 01:32:44,065
The rain drenching you.

1095
01:32:44,149 --> 01:32:48,362
But you find all this pleasurable.
Stimulating, right?

1096
01:32:49,071 --> 01:32:52,449
So yesterday you stuffed this
in that woman's body!

1097
01:32:54,910 --> 01:32:57,705
You remember how many pieces it was?

1098
01:32:58,872 --> 01:33:01,000
One piece, two,

1099
01:33:01,709 --> 01:33:03,543
- three pieces...
- Shut up!

1100
01:33:03,627 --> 01:33:06,504
Four, five, six, seven, eight...

1101
01:33:06,588 --> 01:33:08,048
Shut the fuck up!

1102
01:33:08,132 --> 01:33:10,509
Yong-go!

1103
01:33:15,389 --> 01:33:17,308
I told you not to hit him.

1104
01:33:19,852 --> 01:33:21,812
Didn't I?

1105
01:33:22,229 --> 01:33:27,025
I warned you. You know why journalists
snoop around here.

1106
01:33:27,109 --> 01:33:28,819
You stupid bastard.

1107
01:33:31,905 --> 01:33:36,160
Don't even think about coming
into the interrogation room again.

1108
01:33:50,132 --> 01:33:51,925
I'm going crazy.

1109
01:33:55,304 --> 01:33:57,139
No eyewitnesses

1110
01:33:58,349 --> 01:34:00,225
not one piece of evidence.

1111
01:34:01,894 --> 01:34:04,229
We need something, shit.

1112
01:34:05,022 --> 01:34:08,317
Shit, we don't need any damn witnesses.

1113
01:34:08,942 --> 01:34:10,819
Just a confession will do.

1114
01:34:11,403 --> 01:34:14,531
Just need to beat that bastard
to an inch of his life.

1115
01:34:17,534 --> 01:34:19,244
You've changed.

1116
01:34:21,747 --> 01:34:26,293
Try it and you'll be disgraced.
Like with Kwang-ho.

1117
01:34:30,547 --> 01:34:32,591
Retarded Kwang-ho...

1118
01:34:36,470 --> 01:34:39,014
I always wanted to ask you.

1119
01:34:39,515 --> 01:34:42,392
When you dragged him up the mountain,

1120
01:34:42,476 --> 01:34:48,982
he talked about Hyang-sook's death
in so much detail.

1121
01:34:49,650 --> 01:34:50,942
So?

1122
01:34:51,026 --> 01:34:55,948
Did you really not rehearse
that dialogue with him?

1123
01:34:57,408 --> 01:34:59,201
I told you I didn't!

1124
01:34:59,827 --> 01:35:03,955
But how did he know
the way she was strangled...

1125
01:35:04,039 --> 01:35:05,416
That's my point!

1126
01:35:09,044 --> 01:35:12,213
The tape...
Where's the tape from the mountain?

1127
01:35:12,297 --> 01:35:14,383
Miss Kwon? Gwi-OK.

1128
01:35:14,967 --> 01:35:19,596
<i>Then, Hyang-sook's body shook a bit.</i>

1129
01:35:20,347 --> 01:35:21,848
<i>She looked completely dead.</i>

1130
01:35:21,932 --> 01:35:23,725
Listen to how he speaks here.

1131
01:35:23,809 --> 01:35:28,021
<i>Covered up Hyang-sook's head.</i>

1132
01:35:28,730 --> 01:35:29,815
<i>With what?</i>

1133
01:35:30,232 --> 01:35:32,108
<i>Her panties.</i>

1134
01:35:32,192 --> 01:35:36,613
<i>Her head was covered with her panties.</i>

1135
01:35:36,697 --> 01:35:38,698
He's talking like it was someone else.

1136
01:35:38,782 --> 01:35:40,450
<i>And then?</i>

1137
01:35:40,534 --> 01:35:44,538
He's describing what he saw.

1138
01:35:48,792 --> 01:35:50,919
Kwang-ho is the witness.

1139
01:36:03,056 --> 01:36:04,433
Where did Kwang-ho go?

1140
01:36:05,726 --> 01:36:06,977
Kwang-ho...

1141
01:36:07,644 --> 01:36:10,147
No, no. We came for a drink.

1142
01:36:10,606 --> 01:36:12,441
Some meat, please.

1143
01:36:14,401 --> 01:36:16,195
What are you doing here?

1144
01:36:25,245 --> 01:36:27,206
Control yourself, huh?

1145
01:36:27,998 --> 01:36:31,001
He's not in his room. I'll check outside.

1146
01:36:31,668 --> 01:36:33,462
Try the game arcade.

1147
01:36:35,464 --> 01:36:37,257
How long have you been here?

1148
01:36:38,467 --> 01:36:40,177
Have you seen Kwang-ho?

1149
01:36:53,065 --> 01:36:56,526
<i>It is now 23 months
since the incident first surfaced.</i>

1150
01:36:56,610 --> 01:36:59,488
<i>Before interrogating Detective Moon...</i>

1151
01:37:00,197 --> 01:37:03,116
They should cut off all detectives' dicks!

1152
01:37:03,200 --> 01:37:05,369
Nah, it's not worth it.

1153
01:37:05,786 --> 01:37:07,829
Stupid bastards.

1154
01:37:07,913 --> 01:37:10,207
Quiet, let's listen.

1155
01:37:21,260 --> 01:37:24,929
<i>The trial of detective Moon,
suspected of police torture</i>

1156
01:37:25,013 --> 01:37:26,765
<i>and sexual assault, opened today.</i>

1157
01:37:47,953 --> 01:37:52,207
You fucked your professor,
didn't you, bitch!

1158
01:37:52,291 --> 01:37:55,335
Your parents pay good money...

1159
01:37:57,963 --> 01:37:59,339
Hey, Yong-go!

1160
01:38:05,053 --> 01:38:07,180
Call the police! Police!

1161
01:38:33,498 --> 01:38:34,791
Kwang-ho!

1162
01:38:36,168 --> 01:38:38,086
Kwang-ho! Don't run away!

1163
01:38:39,296 --> 01:38:40,756
Hey, Kwang-ho!

1164
01:38:41,465 --> 01:38:44,217
Kwang-ho!

1165
01:38:51,099 --> 01:38:52,309
Kwang-ho!

1166
01:38:54,436 --> 01:38:55,687
I'm sorry...

1167
01:38:55,771 --> 01:38:58,064
What's wrong with you?

1168
01:38:58,148 --> 01:39:00,984
We're not here to catch you. Come down.

1169
01:39:02,819 --> 01:39:04,488
You're gonna kill me?

1170
01:39:05,030 --> 01:39:08,491
We'll forget that any of that happened.

1171
01:39:08,575 --> 01:39:11,703
If a fight breaks out, that can happen.

1172
01:39:11,787 --> 01:39:15,248
It's okay, just come down, huh?

1173
01:39:15,332 --> 01:39:18,918
If I do, you'll kill me? I know it.

1174
01:39:19,002 --> 01:39:21,254
We won't kill you, just come down.

1175
01:39:21,338 --> 01:39:25,425
Okay, just stay there for now.
We've something to ask you.

1176
01:39:26,259 --> 01:39:28,261
You...

1177
01:39:28,345 --> 01:39:31,306
You remember Hyang-sook?

1178
01:39:32,641 --> 01:39:34,559
Hyang-sook is pretty.

1179
01:39:35,977 --> 01:39:39,314
That's right.
You used to follow after her.

1180
01:39:39,398 --> 01:39:42,108
But that night,

1181
01:39:42,192 --> 01:39:46,863
when it rained, you saw her killed, huh?

1182
01:39:46,947 --> 01:39:49,699
That? I told you already.

1183
01:39:49,783 --> 01:39:53,911
In the forest. I told you already...

1184
01:39:53,995 --> 01:39:58,041
You saw when Hyang-sook was murdered,
didn't you? Here?

1185
01:39:58,125 --> 01:40:00,293
Yeah, here.

1186
01:40:01,294 --> 01:40:04,089
The paddy next to the train tracks.

1187
01:40:07,592 --> 01:40:11,888
That night, did you see the killer's face?

1188
01:40:12,514 --> 01:40:14,975
- Yeah.
- Really?

1189
01:40:15,684 --> 01:40:17,227
Lightning, ka-rang!

1190
01:40:20,605 --> 01:40:23,984
I saw everything from inside here.

1191
01:40:25,485 --> 01:40:28,196
So you saw his face?

1192
01:40:28,280 --> 01:40:29,990
Three times.

1193
01:40:31,450 --> 01:40:33,910
Do you remember him in detail?

1194
01:40:35,120 --> 01:40:36,413
He was handsome.

1195
01:40:37,581 --> 01:40:39,624
More than me.

1196
01:40:45,046 --> 01:40:47,591
Was this the face you saw?

1197
01:40:50,093 --> 01:40:51,428
Look at the picture.

1198
01:41:01,438 --> 01:41:05,609
- You know how hot that fire was?
- Look at the photo!

1199
01:41:06,526 --> 01:41:10,155
- It was so hot!
- Snap out of it!

1200
01:41:11,156 --> 01:41:13,449
Here, look closely.

1201
01:41:13,533 --> 01:41:16,202
Hot, hot, hot, hot!

1202
01:41:16,286 --> 01:41:18,371
Look at the photo!

1203
01:41:18,455 --> 01:41:20,164
Hey. Kwang-ho.

1204
01:41:20,248 --> 01:41:25,753
When I was young, he threw me in the fire.
That man.

1205
01:41:25,837 --> 01:41:27,880
- Kwang-ho!
- You bastards!

1206
01:41:27,964 --> 01:41:29,633
What the hell!

1207
01:41:31,551 --> 01:41:33,261
Please forgive him.

1208
01:41:33,720 --> 01:41:35,138
You bastard!

1209
01:41:35,222 --> 01:41:37,808
What are you students doing?

1210
01:41:38,683 --> 01:41:40,351
We're police!

1211
01:41:40,435 --> 01:41:42,646
Bullshit! Then we're the FBI!

1212
01:41:57,702 --> 01:42:01,665
Hey, Kwang-ho! We're looking for you.

1213
01:42:03,166 --> 01:42:04,209
Hey!

1214
01:42:04,668 --> 01:42:07,212
A train's coming! Come here!

1215
01:42:13,176 --> 01:42:14,803
Out of the way, quick!

1216
01:42:16,888 --> 01:42:17,938
It's dangerous there.

1217
01:42:18,390 --> 01:42:20,683
Out of the way! You idiot!

1218
01:42:20,767 --> 01:42:22,394
Stay away. Go...

1219
01:43:03,310 --> 01:43:06,771
It's okay for you to be here?
They'll be looking for you.

1220
01:43:42,766 --> 01:43:44,517
Yes, yes.

1221
01:43:44,601 --> 01:43:48,521
Journalists tend to be like that.

1222
01:43:48,605 --> 01:43:52,108
Sir, as I said last time...

1223
01:43:52,609 --> 01:43:55,779
Hello? Hello?

1224
01:43:56,196 --> 01:43:58,322
Assholes!

1225
01:43:58,406 --> 01:44:00,659
High-ranking bastards...

1226
01:44:01,117 --> 01:44:03,036
- Chief!
- What?

1227
01:44:03,453 --> 01:44:06,998
It's Investigative Crimes.
They found semen.

1228
01:44:07,457 --> 01:44:08,457
They found what?

1229
01:44:08,541 --> 01:44:09,876
Take a look.

1230
01:44:09,960 --> 01:44:13,045
The semen was found
on the victim's clothing.

1231
01:44:13,129 --> 01:44:17,466
Maybe he masturbated on the corpse,

1232
01:44:17,550 --> 01:44:19,886
and semen fell on her clothes.

1233
01:44:19,970 --> 01:44:22,263
Wait. So

1234
01:44:22,931 --> 01:44:26,017
if the DNA in this semen

1235
01:44:26,101 --> 01:44:28,936
is confirmed to match
that of Park Hyun-gyu,

1236
01:44:29,020 --> 01:44:35,151
then the game's over, isn't it?

1237
01:44:35,235 --> 01:44:38,446
Yes, that would be quite strong evidence.

1238
01:44:38,905 --> 01:44:43,492
The problem is,
we don't have the technology in Korea

1239
01:44:43,576 --> 01:44:45,412
to carry out such tests.

1240
01:44:46,162 --> 01:44:50,166
It must be sent to America.
There's no other way.

1241
01:44:51,668 --> 01:44:55,171
Once the test's complete,
the results will be released.

1242
01:44:55,255 --> 01:44:58,966
So we just have to wait
for the documents from America?

1243
01:44:59,050 --> 01:45:00,218
That's right.

1244
01:45:01,428 --> 01:45:04,555
You sent people
to watch over Park Hyun-gyu?

1245
01:45:04,639 --> 01:45:08,518
Yes! They're watching him 24-hours a day.

1246
01:45:09,436 --> 01:45:11,729
Once the result comes in from America,

1247
01:45:11,813 --> 01:45:15,150
wait until we get our hands
on that bastard.

1248
01:45:32,417 --> 01:45:36,046
- What's wrong with your leg?
- Why?

1249
01:45:36,629 --> 01:45:39,840
- Did you go to the hospital?
- For this little scratch?

1250
01:45:39,924 --> 01:45:43,553
- Come here.
- It's okay. I put on some medicine.

1251
01:45:44,929 --> 01:45:47,098
- What is that?
- Oh, that night...

1252
01:45:49,851 --> 01:45:53,145
- It keeps swelling.
- Come on, let's go.

1253
01:45:53,229 --> 01:45:54,481
Just get in.

1254
01:45:55,774 --> 01:45:58,818
So, you have to amputate?

1255
01:45:59,319 --> 01:46:01,153
Should I explain it again?

1256
01:46:01,237 --> 01:46:04,573
It was pierced,
but why cut off a healthy leg?

1257
01:46:04,657 --> 01:46:06,743
If you don't, he'll die.

1258
01:46:07,911 --> 01:46:10,830
Tetanus is a brutal thing.

1259
01:46:11,664 --> 01:46:14,667
For rusty nails,
you need to see a doctor fast.

1260
01:46:14,751 --> 01:46:17,170
Bunch of dim-witted boneheads.

1261
01:46:17,962 --> 01:46:22,383
Be grateful it's under the knee.

1262
01:46:23,968 --> 01:46:25,344
Crazy bastards.

1263
01:46:25,428 --> 01:46:26,471
Let's go.

1264
01:46:29,891 --> 01:46:30,891
Are you family?

1265
01:46:30,975 --> 01:46:33,185
He doesn't have any,
but I'm like his brother...

1266
01:46:33,269 --> 01:46:35,521
Anyway, you came together, right?

1267
01:46:35,605 --> 01:46:39,818
The authorization for surgery.
Read it, then sign.

1268
01:46:57,252 --> 01:46:58,962
You fucker...

1269
01:47:14,561 --> 01:47:15,812
Hello, post office?

1270
01:47:16,855 --> 01:47:19,107
It's Seo Tae-yoon, Investigative Crimes.

1271
01:47:20,066 --> 01:47:22,861
Have the documents from America arrived?

1272
01:47:25,155 --> 01:47:27,073
Have you checked 100%?

1273
01:47:28,700 --> 01:47:31,286
I keep calling because it's important!

1274
01:47:32,287 --> 01:47:36,666
Since it's so important,
please call as soon as it comes.

1275
01:47:40,837 --> 01:47:42,005
Hello?

1276
01:47:45,049 --> 01:47:46,968
Uh, now?

1277
01:47:48,219 --> 01:47:49,762
Why'd you call me out?

1278
01:47:50,513 --> 01:47:53,266
Why? Can't I do that sometimes?

1279
01:47:53,766 --> 01:47:57,562
Your face looks worn.
Are you sleeping well?

1280
01:47:59,939 --> 01:48:01,941
What kind of detective sleeps well?

1281
01:48:04,319 --> 01:48:08,156
- What's wrong with you?
- Fishing? Damn free-riders.

1282
01:48:12,827 --> 01:48:14,621
Why'd you call out a busy man?

1283
01:48:19,417 --> 01:48:21,669
You look like a corpse.

1284
01:48:25,215 --> 01:48:29,844
It may be no use asking,
but can you do anything else?

1285
01:48:32,096 --> 01:48:33,723
Can you quit your job?

1286
01:49:55,263 --> 01:49:58,057
Violent Crimes Dept! Violent Crimes!

1287
01:49:58,641 --> 01:50:01,185
How many visits in one night?

1288
01:50:01,269 --> 01:50:03,604
Is money that important?

1289
01:50:05,815 --> 01:50:09,485
Bo-kyung's grandmother collapsed again.
I have to go.

1290
01:50:09,569 --> 01:50:12,947
You deserve a medal.

1291
01:50:13,031 --> 01:50:15,158
Get one from the Health Ministry.

1292
01:50:25,293 --> 01:50:28,921
Chief! Park Hyun-gyu
hasn't come home for two hours.

1293
01:50:29,005 --> 01:50:32,175
It's only six stops from there
to his house,

1294
01:50:32,592 --> 01:50:34,426
so he must have gotten off.

1295
01:50:34,510 --> 01:50:37,304
Would a man under investigation
act so wild?

1296
01:50:37,388 --> 01:50:40,058
He's capable of it.

1297
01:50:40,475 --> 01:50:44,645
- He's instinctively crazy.
- You seem like the crazy one!

1298
01:50:44,729 --> 01:50:50,526
Once the DNA tests arrive, he's through.
Stop it.

1299
01:50:51,194 --> 01:50:53,112
I let him go...

1300
01:50:53,905 --> 01:50:56,324
Don't get so upset!

1301
01:52:37,800 --> 01:52:44,765
<i>Citizens, this is a civil defense drill.</i>

1302
01:52:44,849 --> 01:52:49,896
<i>A blackout is called for
in all buildings and houses...</i>

1303
01:54:01,133 --> 01:54:05,304
Will you make any special investigation
into this incident?

1304
01:54:20,736 --> 01:54:23,030
A razor wound in the breast...

1305
01:54:26,158 --> 01:54:27,618
What the hell?

1306
01:54:29,245 --> 01:54:31,747
Something is stuck inside of the vagina.

1307
01:54:33,124 --> 01:54:36,335
Huh? Looks like a ball point pen,

1308
01:54:36,961 --> 01:54:38,670
and a spoon.

1309
01:54:38,754 --> 01:54:40,881
Jesus...

1310
01:54:44,343 --> 01:54:46,554
Look inside, closely.

1311
01:54:53,102 --> 01:54:55,146
Wait, what's that?

1312
01:54:57,273 --> 01:54:59,442
An old band-aid.

1313
01:55:13,205 --> 01:55:14,957
What are you doing?

1314
01:55:17,460 --> 01:55:19,712
Why are you touching a corpse?

1315
01:55:45,237 --> 01:55:46,238
What?

1316
01:55:49,659 --> 01:55:51,118
Get up, you bastard!

1317
01:55:58,417 --> 01:56:00,711
You fucker!

1318
01:56:04,131 --> 01:56:06,384
Get up, you fucker.

1319
01:56:08,552 --> 01:56:11,263
Are you human?

1320
01:56:24,610 --> 01:56:28,406
Nobody will care if I kill you.

1321
01:56:38,791 --> 01:56:40,334
Tell me!

1322
01:56:41,669 --> 01:56:43,462
Tell me you killed them!

1323
01:56:45,965 --> 01:56:47,799
Tell me!

1324
01:56:47,883 --> 01:56:50,678
You killed all those women!

1325
01:57:10,781 --> 01:57:11,866
Yeah.

1326
01:57:12,700 --> 01:57:13,993
I killed them.

1327
01:57:16,328 --> 01:57:18,038
I killed them all.

1328
01:57:22,251 --> 01:57:26,338
That's what you want to hear, right?

1329
01:57:28,007 --> 01:57:29,467
You feel better?

1330
01:57:34,930 --> 01:57:37,016
Inspector Seo!

1331
01:57:38,601 --> 01:57:40,352
The papers from America!

1332
01:57:41,437 --> 01:57:42,730
Read them!

1333
01:57:44,023 --> 01:57:45,273
Shit!

1334
01:57:45,357 --> 01:57:46,525
You fucker!

1335
01:57:48,444 --> 01:57:50,737
You fucker! You mocked us, didn't you?

1336
01:57:50,821 --> 01:57:52,740
You bastard!

1337
01:57:55,075 --> 01:57:56,494
You mocked us!

1338
01:58:14,011 --> 01:58:15,054
What's wrong?

1339
01:58:47,336 --> 01:58:48,796
There's a mistake.

1340
01:58:59,723 --> 01:59:02,351
This document is a lie. I don't need it.

1341
01:59:16,115 --> 01:59:18,242
What does it say, huh?

1342
01:59:26,834 --> 01:59:29,128
It really wasn't you?

1343
01:59:36,594 --> 01:59:37,970
Look in my eyes.

1344
02:00:09,460 --> 02:00:10,878
Look in my eyes!

1345
02:00:25,601 --> 02:00:27,186
Fuck, I don't know.

1346
02:00:34,902 --> 02:00:36,612
Do you get up each morning too?

1347
02:00:40,991 --> 02:00:41,992
Go!

1348
02:00:45,162 --> 02:00:46,705
Just go, fucker!

1349
02:02:02,114 --> 02:02:03,490
That's enough.

1350
02:02:44,031 --> 02:02:45,449
Chi-hyuk.

1351
02:02:46,658 --> 02:02:51,246
You played computer games
all night, right?

1352
02:02:52,247 --> 02:02:53,457
Did you or didn't you?

1353
02:02:58,170 --> 02:02:59,797
Look in my eyes, son.

1354
02:03:00,881 --> 02:03:02,424
Eyes all bloodshot.

1355
02:03:03,759 --> 02:03:06,261
- Do you play well?
- Yeah!

1356
02:03:06,678 --> 02:03:09,598
You don't study,
might as well be good at games.

1357
02:03:10,849 --> 02:03:15,186
If you won't study, go get some exercise.

1358
02:03:15,270 --> 02:03:17,731
Sitting in front of the computer...

1359
02:03:18,148 --> 02:03:19,733
I really didn't!

1360
02:03:19,817 --> 02:03:21,318
What do you mean you didn't?

1361
02:03:21,819 --> 02:03:23,862
Think you can fool my eyes?

1362
02:03:25,280 --> 02:03:27,907
He said he didn't. Believe him.

1363
02:03:27,991 --> 02:03:33,080
No, two days ago,
Manager Oh called my company.

1364
02:03:34,456 --> 02:03:39,127
He kept saying you can't do this
to people, it's not fair.

1365
02:03:39,211 --> 02:03:42,297
You can't believe him.

1366
02:03:43,257 --> 02:03:45,175
Did I do anything wrong?

1367
02:03:46,510 --> 02:03:50,597
Oh, Chairman Kim...
I'm on the road now with our product.

1368
02:03:54,101 --> 02:03:56,812
Sure, let's have dinner with Manager Oh.

1369
02:03:58,355 --> 02:03:59,815
It's been a while.

1370
02:04:03,318 --> 02:04:06,238
Chul-Yong! Pull over a minute!

1371
02:05:44,127 --> 02:05:45,754
Is something in there?

1372
02:05:47,631 --> 02:05:49,174
Is anything in there?

1373
02:05:50,509 --> 02:05:51,927
No...

1374
02:05:53,053 --> 02:05:54,721
Then why are you looking?

1375
02:05:57,182 --> 02:05:58,850
I'm just looking.

1376
02:05:59,935 --> 02:06:01,311
That's so weird.

1377
02:06:03,563 --> 02:06:04,856
What is?

1378
02:06:06,316 --> 02:06:08,067
A while back,

1379
02:06:08,151 --> 02:06:12,197
a man was here looking into that hole.

1380
02:06:16,118 --> 02:06:18,787
I asked him the same question.

1381
02:06:19,496 --> 02:06:21,290
Why he was looking there.

1382
02:06:21,790 --> 02:06:23,000
What did he say?

1383
02:06:23,917 --> 02:06:25,419
What was it?

1384
02:06:26,378 --> 02:06:27,837
Right...

1385
02:06:27,921 --> 02:06:31,675
He remembered
doing something here long ago,

1386
02:06:32,175 --> 02:06:36,013
so he came back to take a look.

1387
02:06:49,693 --> 02:06:51,611
Did you see his face?

1388
02:06:56,992 --> 02:06:58,493
What did he look like?

1389
02:07:00,287 --> 02:07:01,496
Well...

1390
02:07:03,498 --> 02:07:05,042
kind of plain.

1391
02:07:07,294 --> 02:07:08,545
In what way?

1392
02:07:11,590 --> 02:07:12,799
Just...

1393
02:07:15,177 --> 02:07:16,386
ordinary.
