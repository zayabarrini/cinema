1
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:37,009
MOTHER

2
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:15,047
At ease!

3
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:16,590
Salute!

4
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,056
Do-joon!

5
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:26,767
Hey, Benz! You asshole!

6
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:29,895
Do-joon, are you okay?

7
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:31,355
Oh no, blood!

8
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:33,274
Oh no, blood!
Do-joon, you're bleeding!

9
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:36,777
Shit, mom, get back in the store!

10
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:39,780
You're bleeding!

11
00:04:43,993 --> 00:04:45,494
He's bleeding!

12
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:49,581
I knew it!
This is your own blood!

13
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:52,793
To the golf course.
Royal Palace Country Club!

14
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:54,169
Did they go there?

15
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:55,337
You idiot,

16
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:58,173
Where else in this town
would a Benz be going?

17
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:01,176
Is this hit-and-run?

18
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,805
Bastards who slam on the gas
after hitting someone

19
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:06,598
deserve to have
their faces slammed.

20
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:08,100
Look!

21
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:11,812
- I'm bleeding!
- All right, All right.

22
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:15,274
Plate number 5362...
White Benz...

23
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:19,486
It's 5293, idiot.
A black Benz, fuck.

24
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:22,489
Ah, a black Benz, black...

25
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:25,784
How could you mix up...

26
00:05:25,868 --> 00:05:27,369
It could happen.

27
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:30,247
For you, it could...
That head of yours is special.

28
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:34,793
Oh, there it is!

29
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:51,268
That must've hurt.

30
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,983
Come on, stupid.

31
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:16,460
Enough, it's not a surgery.

32
00:06:16,627 --> 00:06:19,380
What are you, a doctor?

33
00:06:19,797 --> 00:06:23,300
Wait, don't move your finger.
What are you doing?

34
00:06:24,385 --> 00:06:27,429
This is driving me crazy.

35
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:30,057
Where the heck has he gone?

36
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:33,602
It's a golf course.

37
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:37,064
Right. It's a golf course.

38
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:41,193
But you don't remember
why we came, do you?

39
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:42,444
Yay!

40
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:48,283
Twelve of them!

41
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,705
What does she see in you anyway?

42
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:55,457
Your mom?

43
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:59,169
Right, mom...

44
00:06:59,795 --> 00:07:01,880
The car... Vroom.

45
00:07:01,964 --> 00:07:03,173
Crash!

46
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:05,092
My blood!

47
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:09,888
This is revenge.

48
00:07:09,972 --> 00:07:12,808
Right, we're here for revenge.

49
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:16,895
Anyway,

50
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:19,606
Where the fuck are
these Benz assholes?

51
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,608
They should have passed by now.

52
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:26,822
Wow, look!

53
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:30,993
What're you gonna do
with all those golf balls?

54
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:38,876
I'll give it to a girl.

55
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,713
You got someone to give it to?

56
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,257
Uh... Yeah.

57
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:47,092
You ever slept with a woman?

58
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:52,264
Idiot...

59
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:54,475
You with your pretty face.

60
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:56,185
I slept with a woman.

61
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:58,562
What woman?

62
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:00,898
Mom.

63
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,986
Where the fuck are they...

64
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:29,468
Come on!

65
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:30,802
They're here!

66
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:35,891
Revenge! Revenge!

67
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,001
What's that idiot doing?

68
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:06,713
What's with him?

69
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:09,216
Fucking assholes!

70
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:13,470
Stop the car! You!

71
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,639
What are you doing?

72
00:09:15,806 --> 00:09:17,266
Who do you think you are?
What is this?

73
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:23,981
You shitheads!

74
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:28,819
Who was driving the car?
You hit-and-run bastards!

75
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,571
Who was driving? You?

76
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:38,996
What is this?

77
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,289
- What's gotten into you?
- Who was it?

78
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:41,915
Were you the one driving?

79
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:02,894
Excuse me.

80
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:05,981
This person is
too important to be here...

81
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:12,654
As I was saying, settlement
would be better for both of you.

82
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:16,283
After all, respected professors
such as yourselves

83
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:19,077
being involved in a hit-and-run...

84
00:10:19,161 --> 00:10:21,788
And these two aren't
some kind of hustlers.

85
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:24,291
They're just local kids.

86
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:30,380
So we're going to settle, okay?

87
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:35,385
The hit-and-run and the assault

88
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:37,471
cancel each other out.

89
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:40,390
<i>Do-joon, the verbal
threats don't factor in.</i>

90
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,477
Dean Kwon, the car...

91
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,397
They smashed my rear-view mirror
in the parking lot.

92
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:49,483
A Mercedes Benz 280.

93
00:10:55,280 --> 00:11:00,160
Aw fuck, why the hell
did you smash their mirror?

94
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:03,914
That'll cost a lot.

95
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,582
You bet.

96
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:10,003
Damn... Why did I do that?

97
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:14,675
You know how much that cost,
you dumb retard?

98
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:18,470
Retard?

99
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:22,683
What are you doing?

100
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:28,480
Let go! Let me go!

101
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:29,731
That bastard,
who does he think he is?

102
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:30,982
Sit down, Mister.

103
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:38,573
The mirror on a Benz...
That would cost...

104
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:39,908
A lot.

105
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:43,203
$1500? $2000?

106
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:47,082
Ah, here she comes...

107
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:48,750
Good afternoon, sir.

108
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,266
Eat up.

109
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:07,644
Eat.

110
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:13,900
Always eat well after
coming back from the police station.

111
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,656
Fuck...

112
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:22,284
I can feed myself.

113
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:33,670
I boiled this
with deodeok root and gugija.

114
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:35,756
It's good for your virility.

115
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,550
Really? My virility?

116
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,678
Why are you
so concerned about that?

117
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:43,680
Women.

118
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,767
Are you seeing someone?

119
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:52,564
Sure. Gonna sleep with her.

120
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:53,857
Sleep with her?

121
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:55,275
Who is it?

122
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,862
Gonna sleep with a woman.

123
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:04,993
How could you do that to
that Benz-whatever?

124
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:07,370
That expensive mirror?

125
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:10,582
Smash! With my foot.

126
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:13,168
It was revenge!

127
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,753
Good boy.

128
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,839
But I've got no money.

129
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:21,593
Where will I dig that up?

130
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:24,179
Whose yard will I dig it up in?

131
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:27,474
Why dig it up?
Just borrow it from Jin-tae.

132
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:28,850
Jin-tae!

133
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:32,854
Stay away from him.
Rotten kid.

134
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,024
He's from bad seed.

135
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:39,986
Okay.

136
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:43,740
Where are you going?

137
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:45,200
To meet Jin-tae.

138
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:49,204
You should finish dinner.

139
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:52,582
Have some medicine then.
You shouldn't skip medicine.

140
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:40,672
Do-joon, you didn't finish this.

141
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:42,799
Come home early!

142
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:45,385
Don't be late.

143
00:15:20,462 --> 00:15:21,963
It doesn't hurt, right?

144
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:24,966
No, it's fine.

145
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:30,305
This won't hurt,
and I won't charge you for it.

146
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:32,599
So can you lend me some money?

147
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:35,602
How much?

148
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:37,854
It's really urgent.

149
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:41,107
And I'll give you medicine
instead of interest.

150
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,860
- Medicine?
- Yes!

151
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:45,987
To make you pregnant,

152
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:48,198
guaranteed effective.

153
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:49,991
Is there such a thing?

154
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:52,285
It really works.

155
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:56,373
I took some, and then
I got pregnant with Do-joon.

156
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:59,751
Your son will be
just as good-looking.

157
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:01,586
Do-joon...

158
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:04,673
His eyes are a work of art.

159
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:06,216
Like a deer's.

160
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,760
- Like mine?
- Yeah.

161
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,221
They're just like yours.

162
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:12,973
They're beautiful.

163
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:16,768
Anyway,

164
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:20,689
you're looking sexier these days...

165
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:23,316
- I mean...
- Yeah, whatever.

166
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,026
Why hasn't Jin-tae shown up?

167
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:28,863
He's not?

168
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:30,865
He should be here by now.

169
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:35,787
You've been saying that for hours.

170
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,498
Don't mess with me.

171
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:43,503
I just came back
from the police station.

172
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:45,672
Have some respect.

173
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:56,808
Jin-tae, where the hell are you?
Hurry up!

174
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:04,065
Go to bed, mom!

175
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:09,779
I'm staying up late.
I told you to go to sleep.

176
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:23,585
Good shot!

177
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:34,554
Hey, wake up.

178
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,307
Wake up!

179
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:41,478
Do something about him.

180
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:56,493
Did you have a nice sleep?

181
00:17:57,077 --> 00:17:59,788
Wipe the spit off your face.

182
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,000
Goddamn freak,
piss off and go to hell.

183
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:08,588
Call your mom and tell her
to come pay the bill!

184
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:09,756
This is driving me crazy.

185
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:11,466
Do-joon!

186
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:13,468
Hey, I told you
to use the backstairs.

187
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:16,888
- Mina!
- How have you been?

188
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:21,476
Yeah, you wanna
have a drink with me?

189
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:22,769
Really?

190
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:27,607
- Turn around and march!
- Call me.

191
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:29,484
Okay, I'm going.

192
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:32,612
Shut up
and go do your homework.

193
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:35,156
That skirt is pretty.

194
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:37,784
You! Turn around!

195
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:39,661
Her legs are prettier.

196
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:41,788
Get your eyes off her!

197
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:43,790
Get out of here!

198
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:44,958
BAR MANHATTAN

199
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:48,962
Please fuck off, okay?

200
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:50,296
Wait...

201
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:53,967
To pay for the drinks...

202
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:56,886
Expensive ones...

203
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,084
Hey!

204
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:32,797
Hey!

205
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:36,509
Where are you going?

206
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:41,806
How about you and me...

207
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:43,266
have a drink?

208
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:47,687
With a guy... Don't want to?

209
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:53,985
You don't like guys?

210
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:24,784
So late...

211
00:22:05,867 --> 00:22:09,996
What was her name, Ah-jung?

212
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:12,999
It's Moon Ah-Jung.

213
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:16,169
Seorin Girls' High School,
second year, fourth class.

214
00:22:16,794 --> 00:22:19,172
You called her house?
She has guardians?

215
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:22,383
There's a grandmother,

216
00:22:22,884 --> 00:22:24,802
but she's a real loon.

217
00:22:24,886 --> 00:22:28,097
Always walking around with
a rice liquor bottle in her fist,

218
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:29,515
making a scene.

219
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:31,434
So the kid is the guardian.

220
00:22:32,435 --> 00:22:34,854
She takes care of her grandma.

221
00:22:38,608 --> 00:22:43,696
Anyway, how long has it been
since we had a murder case?

222
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:50,286
It's the first since I came here.

223
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:53,706
Has it been that long?

224
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:54,874
Yep.

225
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,299
The crime scene seems intact.

226
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:04,675
It is.

227
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:06,260
Quite a picture, huh?

228
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:08,888
Cops these days...

229
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:11,349
You know, CSI and all that on TV.

230
00:23:11,432 --> 00:23:13,601
They all watch it.

231
00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:16,062
The forensics team
is pretty sharp, too.

232
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,272
Anyway,
a rain shower passed earlier.

233
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:21,776
So things must be
pretty mucked up.

234
00:23:22,193 --> 00:23:23,694
I suppose.

235
00:23:24,362 --> 00:23:28,074
Anyway, it must have been
a blunt object.

236
00:23:28,366 --> 00:23:30,910
A fractured cranium,
lots of blood...

237
00:23:44,257 --> 00:23:45,174
What's with this?

238
00:23:45,258 --> 00:23:47,093
Didn't this come in last week?

239
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:52,181
God, that smell...

240
00:23:52,265 --> 00:23:54,183
Yeah, well...

241
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:56,269
This smells like a rotting corpse.

242
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:58,604
My god!

243
00:23:58,688 --> 00:24:00,898
Look at this if you're not blind.

244
00:24:00,982 --> 00:24:03,276
And the appearance...

245
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,280
People are going to think
they're from China.

246
00:24:07,822 --> 00:24:09,282
Ma'am, these are from China.

247
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:10,491
Hey!

248
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:13,703
Give me a break.
Don't even mention China.

249
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:16,456
Besides, Chinese imports
aren't that bad.

250
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:18,875
Don't tell me...

251
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:21,377
You're still giving acupuncture
without a license?

252
00:24:23,546 --> 00:24:26,382
No, no way!

253
00:24:26,466 --> 00:24:27,884
My husband is a public official.

254
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:29,177
You know how much trouble
we'll be in?

255
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,262
Sure, I know.

256
00:24:31,554 --> 00:24:32,972
He'll be promoted soon,

257
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:35,725
so let's not cause any trouble.

258
00:24:36,267 --> 00:24:40,980
Last year, do you know how hard
it was to cover for you?

259
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:43,816
You think only you will
get in trouble?

260
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,444
It will ruin my family completely.

261
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:48,696
Listen when someone's
talking to you.

262
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:49,864
Mom!

263
00:24:51,532 --> 00:24:59,457
Do-joon! Do-joon!

264
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:03,794
Mom!

265
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:06,380
Get down!

266
00:25:07,298 --> 00:25:08,466
Oh geez...

267
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:11,469
She's a good runner.

268
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:57,473
Yoon Do-joon, you're charged with
the murder of Moon Ah-jung.

269
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:00,893
You have the right to remain silent

270
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:04,814
but there's no way
you'll be able to afford a lawyer.

271
00:26:04,981 --> 00:26:07,483
There she is.

272
00:26:07,567 --> 00:26:08,985
Not that she can
afford to do anything.

273
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:13,197
Can't you drive, idiot?

274
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:15,908
Are you hurt anywhere?

275
00:26:15,992 --> 00:26:18,202
Turn your head.
Your head isn't hurt?

276
00:26:18,286 --> 00:26:20,663
Turn your head around.

277
00:26:23,374 --> 00:26:24,959
Why is he...

278
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:31,966
- A dog?
- Dog...

279
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:34,093
- A wolf?
- Dog...

280
00:26:35,636 --> 00:26:36,971
It's usually hot here.

281
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:40,099
We're all guys here,
so take that off.

282
00:26:40,182 --> 00:26:41,892
Your pants too, okay?

283
00:26:41,976 --> 00:26:44,270
- Pants?
- Take off your pants, it's okay.

284
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:49,817
This isn't police torture.

285
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:53,112
I'm taking my pants off too.
It feels good.

286
00:26:55,281 --> 00:27:00,161
Anyway Do-joon,
Have you heard of Sepaktakraw?

287
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:03,372
- You have, right?
- No.

288
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:07,376
Only likes mainstream sports,
the fucker.

289
00:27:09,086 --> 00:27:10,087
Bite it!

290
00:27:13,174 --> 00:27:14,675
Come here and bite it.

291
00:27:18,471 --> 00:27:20,890
That's right, turn around.

292
00:27:21,015 --> 00:27:22,183
The sin always turns around.

293
00:27:22,308 --> 00:27:25,895
Stand straight. Close your eyes.

294
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:28,689
Don't move or you'll get hurt.
Bite it hard!

295
00:27:30,691 --> 00:27:31,651
Did you see it?

296
00:27:32,068 --> 00:27:33,152
I bet not.

297
00:27:34,654 --> 00:27:37,740
This is power of Sepaktakraw.

298
00:27:37,907 --> 00:27:41,452
It's one of the basic moves.

299
00:27:43,663 --> 00:27:48,167
From now on, if you don't
answer clearly yes or no,

300
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:51,295
I'll kill you right here.

301
00:27:51,379 --> 00:27:53,756
I'll be watching you.

302
00:27:53,923 --> 00:27:55,758
Do-joon,

303
00:27:55,925 --> 00:27:58,177
what did you do last night?

304
00:27:58,302 --> 00:27:59,595
Hey, spit out the apple.

305
00:28:01,764 --> 00:28:03,015
What did you do?

306
00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:04,642
I had a drink...

307
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:05,976
Where?

308
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:09,730
- Manhattan.
- That's right. And then?

309
00:28:11,065 --> 00:28:12,483
I slept at home.

310
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:14,068
You slept, of course.

311
00:28:15,069 --> 00:28:17,905
But before that, I mean...

312
00:28:17,988 --> 00:28:20,741
At home, no,
after drinking at Manhattan

313
00:28:20,908 --> 00:28:24,203
on your way home,
what did you do?

314
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:26,580
The lady at Manhattan said

315
00:28:26,664 --> 00:28:29,500
you were like a dog in heat.

316
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:31,210
Her daughter, what's her name?

317
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:34,088
- Mina.
- Right. Mina.

318
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:36,674
You were hitting on her?

319
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:39,969
Well, I...

320
00:28:40,094 --> 00:28:41,887
Answer clearly!

321
00:28:41,971 --> 00:28:44,473
I slept at home. With mom.

322
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:50,980
- That's simple.
- You sleep with your mom?

323
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:58,988
You don't have to answer.

324
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:01,907
Anyway,
you say you don't remember

325
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:05,578
but everyone remembers you.

326
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:08,664
There was a guy who saw you
while feeding his dog.

327
00:29:09,582 --> 00:29:12,460
You were following
after Moon Ah-jung.

328
00:29:12,543 --> 00:29:14,378
Heading towards
the scene of the murder.

329
00:29:15,004 --> 00:29:16,756
Isn't that right?

330
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,469
I don't remember...

331
00:29:21,552 --> 00:29:24,013
You wanna
die here right now, punk?

332
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,015
We've got plenty of apples.

333
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:28,476
- Open your mouth.
- Never mind that.

334
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:30,561
You know,

335
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,397
we also found something

336
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:38,027
next to the body.

337
00:29:41,197 --> 00:29:44,658
Why didn't you put up
a marker next to the body?

338
00:29:44,742 --> 00:29:47,578
With your name written right on it.

339
00:29:48,996 --> 00:29:50,664
- Don't laugh.
- Do-joon,

340
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,083
Just between us...

341
00:29:54,001 --> 00:29:55,085
Why did you do it?

342
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:59,006
On personal level,
I'm really curious.

343
00:30:00,466 --> 00:30:05,387
So did you want to do it
with Moon Ah-jung?

344
00:30:11,018 --> 00:30:14,855
We need to know why,
then the judge can be lenient.

345
00:30:15,189 --> 00:30:18,192
Maybe we can
do something for you.

346
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:21,654
He's asking this
for your own benefit.

347
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,365
Do-joon.

348
00:30:25,366 --> 00:30:27,368
To be honest,

349
00:30:27,868 --> 00:30:30,871
you're not the kind of person
to commit murder.

350
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:33,374
Not everyone
is able to kill someone.

351
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,669
You've never been a bad kid.

352
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:39,213
I can be bad.

353
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:45,511
Jesus...

354
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:51,267
Right, anyone can commit murder.

355
00:30:51,642 --> 00:30:53,769
It's not like you need a license.

356
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:58,566
Anyway,
you don't know the motive,

357
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:03,571
but you killed her, right?

358
00:31:06,574 --> 00:31:09,577
The fact that you killed her,
that's what's important.

359
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:12,496
He confessed.

360
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:18,127
Anyway, this document contains
all the details of the case, see?

361
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:21,130
Check it over.

362
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:25,092
But you can read, right?

363
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:26,760
Want me to read it for you?

364
00:31:26,844 --> 00:31:27,678
I can read.

365
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:33,559
Sure, anyway, don't just sign it
without reading it.

366
00:31:33,684 --> 00:31:36,270
Check the contents, and sign.

367
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:37,938
Read it well.

368
00:31:40,774 --> 00:31:41,859
Why did you do it!

369
00:31:42,693 --> 00:31:44,486
How could you do that?

370
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:47,197
They hit you?

371
00:31:47,865 --> 00:31:51,702
The cops beat you, didn't they?

372
00:31:54,705 --> 00:31:58,292
Where did they hit you?

373
00:31:58,459 --> 00:31:59,752
An apple...

374
00:32:00,961 --> 00:32:02,171
Apple.

375
00:32:02,755 --> 00:32:03,839
Apple.

376
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:15,392
Do-joon,

377
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:18,854
at times like this,
you need to focus your mind.

378
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:22,691
Focus. Take a deep breath.

379
00:32:30,324 --> 00:32:31,200
Do-joon...

380
00:32:31,659 --> 00:32:34,036
Everyone says I killed her.

381
00:32:34,203 --> 00:32:35,871
Breathe like me.

382
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:37,873
And so...

383
00:32:38,749 --> 00:32:41,377
the sin turns around
a few times

384
00:32:42,378 --> 00:32:44,213
- and comes back to me.
- What are you mumbling about?

385
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:47,383
Did you really sign
that confession?

386
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:51,971
Why? Why? Why?

387
00:32:52,054 --> 00:32:55,683
Even if you really did it,
you have to deny it.

388
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:58,227
If I killed her, I should admit it.

389
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,478
Did you kill her?

390
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:01,897
Are you crazy? Of course not.

391
00:33:01,981 --> 00:33:03,691
Then why did you sign it, idiot!

392
00:33:03,774 --> 00:33:05,943
Don't call your son an idiot!

393
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:25,671
Je-mun,

394
00:33:25,796 --> 00:33:28,298
How could you
of all people do this to him?

395
00:33:28,382 --> 00:33:29,591
You know him,

396
00:33:29,675 --> 00:33:32,678
he couldn't even hurt a water bug.

397
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:39,852
A water bug...

398
00:33:43,272 --> 00:33:44,773
Wipe off your face first.

399
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:01,498
Je-mun,

400
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:06,879
here's some of the camphor ginseng
you used to take in high school.

401
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:11,842
You said it helped you think clearly.

402
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:14,845
- Take it.
- Listen.

403
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:17,765
From early morning,

404
00:34:17,848 --> 00:34:19,558
I'm going to be up dealing

405
00:34:19,683 --> 00:34:21,685
with the Juhwang county
robbery case.

406
00:34:22,061 --> 00:34:23,687
And... that crazy kid JP ran away

407
00:34:23,771 --> 00:34:26,315
from the sanatorium
on Mt. Dogye.

408
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:29,568
I gotta go there and then...

409
00:34:29,693 --> 00:34:33,697
I know, I know
how busy you are, but...

410
00:34:33,781 --> 00:34:36,408
What I mean is...

411
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:44,083
regarding Do-joon,

412
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:50,130
his case is closed, okay?

413
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:55,385
Do you understand?

414
00:34:59,306 --> 00:35:02,684
It's finished, 100%.

415
00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:15,781
Bastard,
you sure were having fun.

416
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:20,786
I left early, you ass.

417
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:27,668
Excuse me, people. Step aside.

418
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:43,058
What the hell are you doing?

419
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,978
What's inside this thing anyway?

420
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:02,870
Put it down there.

421
00:36:03,871 --> 00:36:05,497
Turn it over.

422
00:36:05,956 --> 00:36:07,791
What in god's name
are you doing?

423
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:13,422
Are you kidding me?

424
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:15,966
Turn the damn thing over.

425
00:36:17,426 --> 00:36:20,095
Mister, don't touch it!

426
00:36:20,429 --> 00:36:23,098
Actually I'm not a relative,

427
00:36:23,182 --> 00:36:24,099
but I'm close to them.

428
00:36:24,183 --> 00:36:25,392
Sir!

429
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:31,064
If there's a reason
you believe he's not guilty, tell us.

430
00:36:31,565 --> 00:36:34,985
If you read through this here,
you see this golf ball?

431
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:37,571
The golf ball has
already been reported.

432
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:40,157
What's this?
'Apple-biting human rights abuses'?

433
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:45,871
Mister, please read it
before throwing it away.

434
00:36:46,163 --> 00:36:49,416
Read it carefully first,
then throw it away.

435
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:52,085
It's my only son.

436
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:29,081
Is she crazy?

437
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:32,960
Why is that woman here?

438
00:37:33,669 --> 00:37:35,045
Who?

439
00:37:35,504 --> 00:37:36,880
Yoon Do-joon's mother...

440
00:37:40,342 --> 00:37:41,593
No...

441
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:44,680
How the hell could you?

442
00:37:44,972 --> 00:37:46,348
Are you out of your mind?

443
00:37:47,057 --> 00:37:48,684
I'm just...

444
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:53,689
As a member of this community
I wanted to pay my respects.

445
00:37:55,691 --> 00:37:58,777
You came to apologize?
For your son?

446
00:37:58,902 --> 00:38:00,529
Does that make sense?

447
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:11,331
Actually, my son didn't do it.

448
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:18,797
Listen everyone,
regardless what the world may think,

449
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,508
you of all people
must understand!

450
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:23,885
It wasn't my son!

451
00:38:27,514 --> 00:38:29,266
She's completely insane!

452
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:30,517
Hey bitch!

453
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,602
How could you
bring your ugly face here?

454
00:38:32,686 --> 00:38:33,979
Throw some salt at her!

455
00:38:34,104 --> 00:38:36,606
I just wanted to tell you
that my son is innocent.

456
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:37,607
Stop it!

457
00:38:37,691 --> 00:38:38,775
What do you mean he's innocent?

458
00:38:38,859 --> 00:38:40,694
It was your son, Yoon Do-joon!

459
00:38:40,777 --> 00:38:42,779
- The murderer!
- Bring back our Ah-jung!

460
00:38:42,863 --> 00:38:43,989
Bring her back to us!

461
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:45,866
Let's talk civilly!

462
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:51,371
Bring Ah-jung back to life!

463
00:38:51,705 --> 00:38:54,374
- It's a misunderstanding!
- Misunderstanding my ass!

464
00:38:56,877 --> 00:38:59,087
Let go!

465
00:38:59,171 --> 00:39:00,380
What's there to discuss?

466
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:04,009
How could she dare?

467
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:07,179
Shut up you fuckers!

468
00:39:07,262 --> 00:39:10,015
What's this god damn racket?
Fucking bitches.

469
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:14,269
How could you
raise such a rotten son?

470
00:39:14,353 --> 00:39:15,979
That goddamn son of a bitch!

471
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:21,443
Don't curse my son.
I won't stand for it!

472
00:39:22,361 --> 00:39:24,988
Rip that bitch's tongue out!

473
00:39:25,072 --> 00:39:26,865
Don't hate him!

474
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,158
I won't...

475
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:28,260
This place has the best seafood.

476
00:40:28,343 --> 00:40:30,804
You know everything, don't you?

477
00:40:31,263 --> 00:40:32,597
It's true.

478
00:40:32,681 --> 00:40:35,600
Shall we sit down here?

479
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:38,603
When I come to a buffet,
I never sit down.

480
00:40:38,687 --> 00:40:39,813
Don't run!

481
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,984
I just keep scooping it up
and eating it.

482
00:40:44,109 --> 00:40:46,820
Yes of course,
because you're so busy.

483
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:48,613
I save time that way.

484
00:40:49,906 --> 00:40:53,952
This is the lawyer, Gong Suk-ho.

485
00:40:54,077 --> 00:40:55,954
Say hello to him.

486
00:40:58,373 --> 00:40:59,708
Do-joon,

487
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:02,461
Tuck your shirt in.

488
00:41:04,171 --> 00:41:07,174
That side, too.

489
00:41:07,883 --> 00:41:09,718
It looks better this way.

490
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:11,178
Does it?

491
00:41:12,888 --> 00:41:16,183
Are you getting
along well enough here?

492
00:41:16,266 --> 00:41:17,392
Yes,

493
00:41:17,476 --> 00:41:19,978
the food is good.

494
00:41:20,479 --> 00:41:22,731
The rice with beans
is better than I thought.

495
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:26,693
Rice with beans?
That's what prisoners eat.

496
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:29,070
Do-joon!

497
00:41:29,154 --> 00:41:34,159
The most important thing is
what you remember that night.

498
00:41:34,284 --> 00:41:39,998
However small a detail,
just tell him what you can think of.

499
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:41,791
You understand?

500
00:41:41,875 --> 00:41:43,710
What you saw, what you heard,

501
00:41:43,793 --> 00:41:47,380
even what you smelled,
tell him everything in detail.

502
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:51,176
Anyway, you need to try
really hard to remember.

503
00:41:51,468 --> 00:41:54,387
That's your only task in here.

504
00:41:56,389 --> 00:41:57,557
Isn't that right?

505
00:41:58,892 --> 00:41:59,893
Right.

506
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:03,897
Yes, do this.

507
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:08,276
Is this some kind of exercise?

508
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:12,697
No, we call it
the Temples of Doom.

509
00:42:12,781 --> 00:42:15,283
From childhood,
whenever he does this

510
00:42:15,367 --> 00:42:16,993
it helped him remember.

511
00:42:17,077 --> 00:42:19,204
- So for memory?
- Yes, for memory.

512
00:42:19,287 --> 00:42:21,581
Yes, it's some kind of,
what do you call it...

513
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:23,291
acupressure.

514
00:42:25,085 --> 00:42:27,796
Oh, I remember!

515
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,464
What?

516
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:32,801
I didn't do it.

517
00:42:33,802 --> 00:42:34,803
It wasn't me!

518
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:37,973
That's right!
Of course you didn't kill her.

519
00:42:38,056 --> 00:42:39,474
No,

520
00:42:40,642 --> 00:42:42,477
not that.

521
00:42:43,353 --> 00:42:46,565
I didn't kick it off, the mirror!

522
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:52,487
On the Benz... Jin-tae...

523
00:42:52,988 --> 00:42:56,992
It was Jin-tae who did it.

524
00:42:57,826 --> 00:43:01,830
I went whoosh!
And he went crunch!

525
00:43:03,832 --> 00:43:04,874
Sir.

526
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:06,543
Let me explain.

527
00:43:06,626 --> 00:43:08,962
What he is saying is...
It's a long story.

528
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:10,171
Wait!

529
00:43:22,183 --> 00:43:24,978
I just got an urgent message
from the office.

530
00:43:25,645 --> 00:43:26,813
I need to go.

531
00:43:26,896 --> 00:43:28,481
Then what about us?

532
00:43:28,565 --> 00:43:31,568
For a first meeting,
this is enough.

533
00:43:31,651 --> 00:43:34,279
- Should I Call you?
- I'll call you.

534
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:38,783
Then when will you call?

535
00:43:39,159 --> 00:43:40,285
Sir...

536
00:43:48,001 --> 00:43:49,002
What?

537
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:53,673
Did he leave?
He doesn't like us, does he?

538
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:55,008
He's a very busy man.

539
00:43:55,091 --> 00:43:58,178
The most expensive lawyer
in our county.

540
00:43:58,303 --> 00:44:00,680
Damn, wasn't there
anything else to tell him?

541
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:02,098
I should have said more.

542
00:44:02,182 --> 00:44:05,185
Right, who cares about
the mirror?

543
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:08,396
But, you mean
it was Jin-tae who did it?

544
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:13,151
I knew it.

545
00:44:13,276 --> 00:44:16,363
That rotten little scoundrel.

546
00:44:16,446 --> 00:44:18,448
That jerk never came
to visit me even once.

547
00:44:22,452 --> 00:44:24,079
But Do-joon,

548
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:29,292
that night, didn't you go out
to meet Jin-tae?

549
00:44:30,752 --> 00:44:32,462
Then you never met him.

550
00:44:34,923 --> 00:44:37,008
And the golf balls,

551
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:41,096
he knew about those, right?

552
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:59,280
Good afternoon.
I've come to see Attorney Gong.

553
00:44:59,906 --> 00:45:01,991
He's not in now.

554
00:45:02,575 --> 00:45:04,744
His car is outside.

555
00:45:05,495 --> 00:45:07,497
He's really not here.

556
00:45:08,081 --> 00:45:09,374
He is, isn't he?

557
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:11,584
Oh, Mr. Gong! Excuse me!

558
00:45:11,668 --> 00:45:13,086
Oh, look who's here!

559
00:45:13,211 --> 00:45:14,921
- Sir, I...
- Yes?

560
00:45:15,004 --> 00:45:17,757
- Miss Kim, some green tea!
- What I'd like to say is...

561
00:45:19,384 --> 00:45:21,553
If he's here, why can't I...

562
00:45:21,636 --> 00:45:23,763
Ma'am, would you prefer coffee?

563
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:27,642
To be honest, about your case,

564
00:45:27,767 --> 00:45:32,897
we are proceeding
slowly and methodically.

565
00:45:32,981 --> 00:45:33,982
Here, have some.

566
00:45:34,107 --> 00:45:37,569
I understand you feel impatient.

567
00:45:37,652 --> 00:45:39,654
But what can we do?

568
00:45:39,779 --> 00:45:41,990
You just need to wait patiently.

569
00:45:42,115 --> 00:45:46,911
But we need to open an investigation
on Do-joon's friend, Jin-tae!

570
00:45:46,995 --> 00:45:49,289
Ma'am!

571
00:45:49,581 --> 00:45:52,083
Let me be honest with you.

572
00:45:52,459 --> 00:45:55,086
In monetary terms,

573
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:56,379
if this were Seoul,

574
00:45:56,463 --> 00:45:58,381
the fee we're charging

575
00:45:58,465 --> 00:46:01,760
wouldn't cover an assault case
involving two broken teeth.

576
00:46:01,843 --> 00:46:07,098
You should understand that.

577
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:21,279
<i>This is Jin-tae's house.</i>

578
00:46:22,197 --> 00:46:25,658
<i>I'm out right now,
so leave me a message.</i>

579
00:46:26,284 --> 00:46:29,746
<i>If you are interested
in fishing equipment or bait</i>

580
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:35,835
<i>you can call me at
010-3154-1406.</i>

581
00:47:51,786 --> 00:47:53,371
Son of a bitch.

582
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:03,882
<i>Files on Scientific Investigation</i>

583
00:49:12,742 --> 00:49:14,285
Blood...

584
00:50:07,797 --> 00:50:08,798
Stop.

585
00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:16,389
I said stop.

586
00:50:16,806 --> 00:50:18,766
Let me look at this first.

587
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:20,184
Let me take this off first.

588
00:50:22,061 --> 00:50:25,064
- Cooperate a little.
- Just a sec.

589
00:50:25,189 --> 00:50:26,858
Okay, okay.

590
00:50:27,942 --> 00:50:30,194
There you go.

591
00:50:30,278 --> 00:50:34,198
Shit, this is the climax.

592
00:51:23,081 --> 00:51:25,750
Spa-shew!

593
00:51:28,044 --> 00:51:29,295
Ti-ra-mi-su!

594
00:51:31,672 --> 00:51:32,590
Tsu-na-mi!

595
00:51:32,673 --> 00:51:33,674
Mi-ner-al!

596
00:51:33,758 --> 00:51:34,759
Al-arm!

597
00:51:35,384 --> 00:51:36,761
Arm-a-dil-lo!

598
00:54:46,075 --> 00:54:47,576
Where's Je-mun?

599
00:54:49,245 --> 00:54:51,497
- Detective Nam Je-mun.
- What's the problem?

600
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:52,665
Out of my way.

601
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:03,259
Push this.

602
00:55:05,177 --> 00:55:06,887
<i>It's not yours, right?</i>

603
00:55:06,971 --> 00:55:08,347
<i>Yes!</i>

604
00:55:09,807 --> 00:55:10,683
<i>Do I look pretty?</i>

605
00:55:10,808 --> 00:55:11,809
She put way too much on.

606
00:55:11,892 --> 00:55:15,604
Isn't that...
the Manhattan lady's daughter?

607
00:55:20,067 --> 00:55:22,862
Is this what you do together?

608
00:55:24,572 --> 00:55:26,866
Lucky bastard.

609
00:55:30,494 --> 00:55:33,372
Watch this part, here.

610
00:55:34,248 --> 00:55:37,877
That's what it is, lipstick?

611
00:55:39,003 --> 00:55:40,588
But do you play golf?

612
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:42,381
Me, golf?

613
00:55:42,506 --> 00:55:45,885
Those professors
gave it to me when they left.

614
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:47,511
Excuse me. Sir?

615
00:55:49,263 --> 00:55:52,266
Do we really have to call
the forensics team?

616
00:55:53,351 --> 00:55:56,979
Anyone can tell
this is just lipstick.

617
00:55:57,438 --> 00:56:00,358
All right,
tell them not to bother.

618
00:56:23,172 --> 00:56:24,173
Wait!

619
00:56:24,965 --> 00:56:30,763
Take an umbrella.

620
00:57:10,803 --> 00:57:11,887
Wait a minute.

621
00:57:48,549 --> 00:57:51,177
I went to pick you up
at the station.

622
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:55,723
Please get in.
Attorney Gong wants to see you.

623
00:58:05,983 --> 00:58:08,527
Welcome, ma'am.

624
00:58:09,153 --> 00:58:12,698
We started without you.

625
00:58:12,781 --> 00:58:14,700
You, wait outside.

626
00:58:15,367 --> 00:58:18,871
Have a seat.

627
00:58:21,165 --> 00:58:22,791
You've had quite a day today.

628
00:58:23,459 --> 00:58:26,170
I heard it from the police chief.

629
00:58:26,712 --> 00:58:29,548
I feel so sad for you.

630
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:34,178
It's the first time I've seen
you sitting down.

631
00:58:35,471 --> 00:58:38,682
Ah, you have a fine wit.

632
00:58:40,684 --> 00:58:41,894
Pass her a drink.

633
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:48,567
Ma'am, do you remember
the 2002 World Cup?

634
00:58:49,276 --> 00:58:51,070
The Red Devils,

635
00:58:51,195 --> 00:58:52,696
Gus Hiddink!

636
00:58:54,365 --> 00:58:57,993
Four years passed in a ﬂash

637
00:58:58,452 --> 00:59:01,705
I could still feel
the excitement of 2002.

638
00:59:01,789 --> 00:59:04,083
But then suddenly
it was 2006.

639
00:59:05,209 --> 00:59:07,920
The Germany World Cup!

640
00:59:08,587 --> 00:59:11,632
Four years
is no time at all, I mean.

641
00:59:12,466 --> 00:59:14,969
I really don't understand
what you're saying.

642
00:59:16,053 --> 00:59:17,346
Regarding Do-joon,

643
00:59:18,472 --> 00:59:20,975
let's send him off
for just four years.

644
00:59:24,061 --> 00:59:26,063
It'll be a hospital, not a jail,

645
00:59:26,647 --> 00:59:29,567
and he won't
have to serve 15 years.

646
00:59:33,279 --> 00:59:34,280
Ma'am!

647
00:59:35,072 --> 00:59:37,283
We need to think realistically.

648
00:59:37,366 --> 00:59:42,496
Four years in a mental institution
for this case is a legal jackpot!

649
00:59:49,378 --> 00:59:50,462
Music!

650
00:59:54,091 --> 00:59:58,095
Ma'am.
I forgot to introduce you.

651
00:59:58,887 --> 01:00:04,268
To my right,
my high school classmate,

652
01:00:04,393 --> 01:00:06,812
the president of
Agape Psychiatric Hospital,

653
01:00:06,895 --> 01:00:09,481
Doctor Yoon Jong-gu!

654
01:00:11,275 --> 01:00:13,569
Hey, wake him up?

655
01:00:14,486 --> 01:00:16,572
And next to me

656
01:00:16,655 --> 01:00:19,992
my bar exam classmate,

657
01:00:20,075 --> 01:00:22,661
Attorney Park Jong-pyo!

658
01:00:24,371 --> 01:00:25,539
He's handsome.

659
01:00:25,664 --> 01:00:27,875
What? Are you holding a protest?

660
01:00:28,167 --> 01:00:30,878
He's smashed
after just a few drinks.

661
01:00:31,003 --> 01:00:32,171
Mr. Gong!

662
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:38,093
Look, my son is...

663
01:01:55,003 --> 01:01:56,213
Do-joon!

664
01:02:04,471 --> 01:02:05,764
Why are you so late?

665
01:02:10,477 --> 01:02:12,187
You've been drinking, haven't you?

666
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:14,773
It's so late...

667
01:02:15,274 --> 01:02:16,400
Did you eat?

668
01:02:20,195 --> 01:02:21,196
Eat?

669
01:02:21,989 --> 01:02:24,783
I was wondering if you ate.

670
01:02:26,118 --> 01:02:27,786
Thanks so much for asking.

671
01:02:28,287 --> 01:02:31,123
Anyway,
I feel so fucking betrayed.

672
01:02:31,165 --> 01:02:32,833
How could you
do this to me, bitch!

673
01:02:35,836 --> 01:02:39,465
Jin-tae, I did a terrible thing.

674
01:02:41,091 --> 01:02:42,259
Forget that.

675
01:02:43,010 --> 01:02:45,262
Just pay me $5000
as a settlement.

676
01:02:46,096 --> 01:02:47,264
In cash.

677
01:02:48,682 --> 01:02:51,477
All I have right now...

678
01:02:51,852 --> 01:02:54,021
it's not much...

679
01:02:54,688 --> 01:02:56,023
Wait...

680
01:02:56,106 --> 01:03:05,574
I've been saving this
to pay back my debt.

681
01:03:05,657 --> 01:03:07,367
Take this for now.

682
01:03:15,584 --> 01:03:16,835
Okay.

683
01:03:19,463 --> 01:03:22,007
Send the rest to my bank account.

684
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:24,092
I'll text you the account number.

685
01:03:26,303 --> 01:03:27,387
You know what texting is?

686
01:03:39,858 --> 01:03:42,736
Wait. By the way,

687
01:03:44,279 --> 01:03:46,573
that dead girl, Moon Ah-jung.

688
01:03:48,283 --> 01:03:49,868
Do you know anything about her?

689
01:03:53,664 --> 01:03:56,750
Actually there were
rumors about her from way back.

690
01:03:58,585 --> 01:04:02,381
It's not nice to talk
this way about the dead,

691
01:04:05,509 --> 01:04:07,886
but rumors are rumors.

692
01:04:10,013 --> 01:04:11,098
Look,

693
01:04:11,557 --> 01:04:14,268
there are only three motives
for murder.

694
01:04:14,351 --> 01:04:18,480
Money, passion, and vengeance.

695
01:04:19,273 --> 01:04:21,942
Try to think this through.

696
01:04:22,109 --> 01:04:26,113
That poor kid living on the hill,
what kind of money could she have?

697
01:04:27,114 --> 01:04:28,782
So it must be

698
01:04:28,866 --> 01:04:33,370
either passion or vengeance.

699
01:04:34,580 --> 01:04:36,206
So we need to start

700
01:04:36,290 --> 01:04:38,375
by investigating
the people around her.

701
01:04:41,378 --> 01:04:42,796
But those fuckers
on the police force

702
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:45,090
found that golf ball

703
01:04:45,173 --> 01:04:47,467
and just close the case?

704
01:04:47,551 --> 01:04:48,927
Exactly.

705
01:04:50,554 --> 01:04:53,765
Do-joon is the
obvious scapegoat for them.

706
01:04:55,475 --> 01:04:57,936
If it were me,
I'd never investigate like that.

707
01:04:59,396 --> 01:05:01,940
Sorry, I didn't know
you thought that way.

708
01:05:05,402 --> 01:05:09,281
Of course. Do-joon has been
totally fucked over.

709
01:05:09,948 --> 01:05:11,783
I'm his friend after all.

710
01:05:12,576 --> 01:05:15,787
Thank you, Jin-tae.

711
01:05:17,414 --> 01:05:20,292
Don't cry!
This is no time to cry.

712
01:05:21,585 --> 01:05:22,586
Quit it!

713
01:05:30,594 --> 01:05:31,762
Anyway,

714
01:05:34,973 --> 01:05:37,100
Do you know
what the strangest thing is?

715
01:05:42,856 --> 01:05:43,857
The roof.

716
01:05:46,610 --> 01:05:50,197
The body was left on the roof.
That dead girl.

717
01:05:52,449 --> 01:05:54,284
Usually you bury a dead body.

718
01:05:55,035 --> 01:05:57,204
But in this case,
it was hoisted up.

719
01:05:59,289 --> 01:06:02,209
Her body was
practically put out on display.

720
01:06:03,377 --> 01:06:04,753
Like hanging out laundry.

721
01:06:08,298 --> 01:06:10,050
'Look, everyone,

722
01:06:11,385 --> 01:06:14,596
I murdered this fucking bitch.

723
01:06:15,597 --> 01:06:17,224
Do you see the corpse?'

724
01:06:19,309 --> 01:06:22,312
That sort of thing...

725
01:06:55,303 --> 01:06:56,596
Look.

726
01:06:57,389 --> 01:07:01,268
If you put the body there,
the whole town can see it.

727
01:07:02,185 --> 01:07:04,938
Anyway this neighborhood
is pretty strange.

728
01:07:05,772 --> 01:07:06,857
So my point is...

729
01:07:08,066 --> 01:07:09,776
Don't trust anyone.

730
01:07:10,777 --> 01:07:12,195
You don't need them.

731
01:07:13,071 --> 01:07:14,406
Don't even trust me.

732
01:07:16,867 --> 01:07:19,286
You go out and find the real killer.

733
01:07:40,307 --> 01:07:41,391
Do-joon,

734
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:45,687
you're trying hard to remember
that night, right?

735
01:07:51,318 --> 01:07:53,862
If you recall
or remember something,

736
01:07:53,987 --> 01:07:56,573
be sure to tell just me.

737
01:07:57,324 --> 01:08:01,078
Only to me.
Do you understand?

738
01:08:01,578 --> 01:08:04,581
What about that lawyer?

739
01:08:05,749 --> 01:08:07,751
I fired him.

740
01:08:13,673 --> 01:08:17,761
You printed the memorial photo
for Moon Ah-jung, right?

741
01:08:24,684 --> 01:08:27,145
She's a real pretty girl.

742
01:08:27,312 --> 01:08:29,898
That's why
'pretty girls have no luck.'

743
01:08:29,981 --> 01:08:31,483
Isn't it 'pretty girls die young?'

744
01:08:31,608 --> 01:08:34,152
That's why she left us early.

745
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:36,780
That girl, her mother died early

746
01:08:36,905 --> 01:08:39,282
and her father ran off
with another woman.

747
01:08:39,366 --> 01:08:41,576
Her relatives are
a bunch of bitches too.

748
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:44,287
That young thing got
by all on her own.

749
01:08:44,579 --> 01:08:46,289
She must have been
lonely as hell.

750
01:08:46,373 --> 01:08:47,290
Who're you talking about?

751
01:08:47,582 --> 01:08:50,043
Ah-jung.
They say she had a boyfriend.

752
01:08:50,168 --> 01:08:51,169
Who?

753
01:08:51,294 --> 01:08:52,504
Crazy JP.

754
01:08:52,879 --> 01:08:53,964
Crazy JP from the sanatorium?

755
01:08:54,047 --> 01:08:56,174
No fucking way.

756
01:08:56,299 --> 01:08:58,510
Crazy JP is ugly as hell.

757
01:08:58,593 --> 01:09:02,305
It's true.
Ah-jung really liked boys.

758
01:09:02,389 --> 01:09:03,682
They say she couldn't
even take a nap by herself.

759
01:09:03,807 --> 01:09:05,684
Those are all lies.

760
01:09:05,809 --> 01:09:07,894
Ah-jung's nickname
was Rice Cake Girl.

761
01:09:08,687 --> 01:09:10,063
Rice Cake?

762
01:09:10,188 --> 01:09:11,857
Did she eat lots of rice cake?

763
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:13,483
I bet she ate fish cake too.

764
01:09:14,860 --> 01:09:18,655
Isn't there anything else
you kids remember about her?

765
01:09:19,573 --> 01:09:22,409
I remember
seeing her from the back.

766
01:09:24,077 --> 01:09:25,412
She wore a backpack.

767
01:09:25,871 --> 01:09:27,164
White calves.

768
01:09:28,498 --> 01:09:30,792
Are you sure she was alone?

769
01:09:30,876 --> 01:09:32,169
There was nobody else?

770
01:09:39,426 --> 01:09:42,179
From Manhattan up to that place,

771
01:09:42,262 --> 01:09:45,056
you saw no one else?

772
01:09:45,765 --> 01:09:46,975
You see him?

773
01:09:48,226 --> 01:09:51,146
Go over and call him retard.

774
01:09:51,229 --> 01:09:52,230
And then what?

775
01:09:53,148 --> 01:09:56,234
It's fucking hilarious.

776
01:09:58,570 --> 01:09:59,988
You gotta try it.

777
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:02,699
You guarantee me
this will be funny?

778
01:10:02,782 --> 01:10:04,409
Just try.

779
01:10:08,413 --> 01:10:09,497
Retard!

780
01:10:18,256 --> 01:10:19,466
Hey retard!

781
01:10:24,763 --> 01:10:27,682
What the fuck,
I feel like an idiot.

782
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:30,894
Here he comes!

783
01:10:31,770 --> 01:10:33,897
How could you do that?

784
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:35,273
Why would you fight...

785
01:10:35,774 --> 01:10:37,776
I told you to meditate.

786
01:10:37,901 --> 01:10:39,986
That's what I was doing.
Shoot...

787
01:10:40,695 --> 01:10:42,781
Quiet down.

788
01:10:42,906 --> 01:10:44,783
You don't know anything, mom.

789
01:10:45,617 --> 01:10:47,494
Sure, your mom
doesn't know anything.

790
01:10:47,619 --> 01:10:48,912
What would I know?

791
01:10:49,704 --> 01:10:52,040
Why don't you just keep quiet?

792
01:10:54,042 --> 01:10:57,587
You told me if anyone insults me,
I should kick their ass.

793
01:10:58,588 --> 01:11:00,257
Sure, if they insult you...

794
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:01,258
Kick their ass.

795
01:11:01,341 --> 01:11:02,342
If they hit you once...

796
01:11:03,885 --> 01:11:05,053
Hit back twice.

797
01:11:05,887 --> 01:11:08,974
What about your poor body?

798
01:11:09,057 --> 01:11:10,767
Did you take your medicine?

799
01:11:11,351 --> 01:11:12,894
Did they give you some?

800
01:11:14,354 --> 01:11:15,689
But you know,

801
01:11:17,899 --> 01:11:19,359
it's amazing.

802
01:11:19,693 --> 01:11:20,694
What?

803
01:11:23,530 --> 01:11:25,865
After I got beaten, I remembered.

804
01:11:26,241 --> 01:11:27,784
The memories came back.

805
01:11:28,868 --> 01:11:30,578
You remembered something?

806
01:11:38,586 --> 01:11:39,879
Something important.

807
01:11:40,255 --> 01:11:41,256
Then what is it?

808
01:11:42,590 --> 01:11:45,093
That you tried to kill me.

809
01:11:50,098 --> 01:11:51,808
When I was five, right?

810
01:11:53,893 --> 01:11:58,356
You gave me a Bacchus bottle
with insecticide in it.

811
01:12:07,866 --> 01:12:09,242
Do-joon!

812
01:12:09,868 --> 01:12:11,369
Are you okay?

813
01:12:11,494 --> 01:12:13,788
Shit, this is embarrassing.

814
01:12:13,872 --> 01:12:14,873
What?

815
01:12:15,165 --> 01:12:16,875
There are lots of people here.

816
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,586
How could you remember?

817
01:12:20,253 --> 01:12:21,796
It's true.

818
01:12:22,505 --> 01:12:24,591
You tried to get rid of me.

819
01:12:24,716 --> 01:12:26,009
How could you say that?

820
01:12:26,092 --> 01:12:29,596
I was so desperate...
I was going to kill both of us.

821
01:12:29,721 --> 01:12:31,765
But you made me drink it first.
The insecticide drink.

822
01:12:31,848 --> 01:12:33,600
Will you shut up?

823
01:12:36,269 --> 01:12:39,981
You had to be first,
so that I could follow.

824
01:12:40,065 --> 01:12:41,691
Let's step outside.

825
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:45,612
I was so desperate then.

826
01:12:45,695 --> 01:12:47,280
You and me are one.

827
01:12:47,781 --> 01:12:49,699
We've only got each other.

828
01:12:49,783 --> 01:12:51,868
Hey, get over here quick!

829
01:12:53,161 --> 01:12:55,872
How could a five-year-old
remember something like that?

830
01:12:57,165 --> 01:12:59,292
Ma'am, please stop this.

831
01:12:59,709 --> 01:13:01,169
Let me give you acupuncture.

832
01:13:03,296 --> 01:13:05,173
There's a meridian point

833
01:13:05,256 --> 01:13:07,759
that can loosen the knots
in your heart

834
01:13:07,884 --> 01:13:10,178
and clear all horrible memories
from your mind.

835
01:13:11,429 --> 01:13:12,764
Let me see your thigh.

836
01:13:13,348 --> 01:13:15,350
I'm the only one
who knows this point.

837
01:13:15,683 --> 01:13:19,604
Up your thigh to the partition.
5 inches from here and 3 1/2 again.

838
01:13:19,687 --> 01:13:21,272
Ma'am!

839
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:25,443
Jong-do,

840
01:13:25,985 --> 01:13:28,446
you can see that he's sick inside.

841
01:13:29,197 --> 01:13:31,199
Please let me do it.

842
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:33,201
Why,

843
01:13:35,995 --> 01:13:37,956
this time you gonna kill me
with your needles?

844
01:13:39,958 --> 01:13:43,169
What are you doing?
Hurry up and get him out!

845
01:13:47,173 --> 01:13:49,175
Don't ever come again, mom.

846
01:13:49,676 --> 01:13:51,261
I won't see you.

847
01:15:19,432 --> 01:15:20,683
This photo...

848
01:15:21,059 --> 01:15:24,687
Can you enlarge it
and print it out clearly?

849
01:15:33,988 --> 01:15:37,700
I should've
used Gramoxon back then.

850
01:15:37,992 --> 01:15:42,705
If I had, we'd be frolicking
in heaven's ﬂower garden right now,

851
01:15:42,997 --> 01:15:44,582
instead of suffering.

852
01:15:45,917 --> 01:15:47,919
I didn't have the heart,
so I used Lone Star.

853
01:15:48,002 --> 01:15:49,379
That's a weaker brand.

854
01:15:50,004 --> 01:15:53,967
So instead of dying, we spent
two days vomiting and shitting water.

855
01:15:56,052 --> 01:16:00,974
After that, I fed him
all the good stuff in the world...

856
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:07,063
He was the cutest then.

857
01:16:07,647 --> 01:16:09,274
Though he's still cute now.

858
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:14,654
Yeah, in this photo
he's cute as a button.

859
01:16:15,196 --> 01:16:17,198
It makes you want to
have a baby, huh?

860
01:16:17,490 --> 01:16:18,491
Yeah.

861
01:16:18,825 --> 01:16:21,828
You will soon. You're taking
the medicine I gave you?

862
01:16:21,911 --> 01:16:23,079
Sure.

863
01:16:23,997 --> 01:16:25,540
This thing is amazing.

864
01:16:27,083 --> 01:16:29,877
There's nothing
you can't do these days.

865
01:16:31,254 --> 01:16:33,464
This is nothing, just the basics.

866
01:16:36,968 --> 01:16:39,387
Just the basics...

867
01:16:42,974 --> 01:16:46,561
This works great.
It's completely gone.

868
01:16:46,644 --> 01:16:48,187
This is nothing, just the basics.

869
01:16:48,563 --> 01:16:50,273
It came out well.

870
01:16:50,648 --> 01:16:51,899
Do you like it?

871
01:16:52,650 --> 01:16:54,902
I wish this would work in the mirror.

872
01:16:56,404 --> 01:16:57,822
By the way,

873
01:16:57,864 --> 01:17:01,075
how much would it cost

874
01:17:01,159 --> 01:17:05,371
to print about
twenty cell phone pictures?

875
01:17:05,997 --> 01:17:07,290
Not sure.

876
01:17:07,874 --> 01:17:10,376
But why would you
want to print those anyway?

877
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:12,670
The quality won't be very good.

878
01:17:14,297 --> 01:17:15,798
Well,

879
01:17:16,466 --> 01:17:18,092
it's just a memento.

880
01:17:25,808 --> 01:17:27,185
Shit.

881
01:17:27,894 --> 01:17:29,312
Here's a tissue.

882
01:17:32,565 --> 01:17:36,069
This happens
to you like every day.

883
01:17:37,737 --> 01:17:39,572
Why don't you go see a doctor?

884
01:17:39,906 --> 01:17:41,741
It's too expensive.

885
01:17:42,909 --> 01:17:44,077
Right,

886
01:17:44,577 --> 01:17:47,747
the one with the nosebleed
was Ah-Jung.

887
01:17:47,914 --> 01:17:50,291
But why cell phone photos?

888
01:17:51,584 --> 01:17:53,169
The photos...

889
01:17:55,380 --> 01:17:57,298
are pretty awesome.

890
01:17:58,299 --> 01:17:59,300
Ma'am,

891
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:04,180
You've got plenty of rice,
and the water works.

892
01:18:04,555 --> 01:18:08,559
And you have rice liquor, I see.
Do you have a cell phone?

893
01:18:08,893 --> 01:18:11,479
Why? You wanna buy me one?

894
01:18:13,272 --> 01:18:15,358
Or even better,
just give me the money.

895
01:18:15,733 --> 01:18:17,985
Your land line is dead,
that's why.

896
01:18:18,653 --> 01:18:20,738
Who knows, ask Ah-jung.

897
01:18:20,905 --> 01:18:24,200
That bitch left home
and hasn't come back.

898
01:19:12,749 --> 01:19:16,753
Wow, the poop is spinning.

899
01:19:18,254 --> 01:19:20,840
Where can I get that done?

900
01:19:21,674 --> 01:19:23,384
I made it myself.

901
01:19:23,468 --> 01:19:25,094
Really?

902
01:19:25,178 --> 01:19:29,557
I like that kind of thing too.
I want one. Like this.

903
01:19:31,851 --> 01:19:34,020
That model is kind of too old.

904
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:38,399
She's really good at that.
She makes pervert phones too.

905
01:19:38,483 --> 01:19:41,027
- If you pay her.
- Shut up.

906
01:19:42,570 --> 01:19:44,197
Earn lots of cash, bye.

907
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:46,282
What's a pervert phone?

908
01:19:47,158 --> 01:19:52,079
When cellphones take pictures,
they always make a sound.

909
01:19:52,163 --> 01:19:54,165
Cheese, ding!

910
01:19:54,665 --> 01:19:56,292
I just tweak it
to remove the sound

911
01:19:56,375 --> 01:19:58,002
for hidden cameras.

912
01:19:58,586 --> 01:20:01,756
I'd like that
even more than the poop.

913
01:20:03,591 --> 01:20:08,596
You're a master.
Where did you learn all this?

914
01:20:09,388 --> 01:20:13,184
It's just a hobby
and part-time job.

915
01:20:22,276 --> 01:20:24,987
Did you do this for
that poor girl Ah-jung?

916
01:20:27,865 --> 01:20:30,368
You know where
her cell phone is, don't you?

917
01:20:30,493 --> 01:20:31,661
Ma'am.

918
01:20:34,205 --> 01:20:37,375
Do you have it?

919
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:38,668
What?

920
01:20:40,503 --> 01:20:41,671
A menstrual pad.

921
01:20:43,089 --> 01:20:45,758
I haven't used one in ages.

922
01:20:47,093 --> 01:20:50,096
There's a store across the street.

923
01:20:50,388 --> 01:20:52,348
Could you go buy me some?

924
01:20:52,932 --> 01:20:55,101
I'm so sorry.

925
01:20:55,184 --> 01:20:57,937
Why'd this happen all of a sudden?
It's not time yet.

926
01:21:01,482 --> 01:21:04,777
Don't go anywhere, okay?

927
01:21:31,554 --> 01:21:33,389
- I know you have it, bitch.
- I don't.

928
01:21:33,472 --> 01:21:37,852
Hey! If we find it on you,
you're dead meat.

929
01:21:37,935 --> 01:21:39,562
Fuck, I'm gonna search you.

930
01:21:40,688 --> 01:21:41,939
Look in her bag.

931
01:21:42,106 --> 01:21:44,692
If we find it,
we're gonna rip your head off.

932
01:21:44,775 --> 01:21:47,695
I know you have it bitch.
Where did you stash it?

933
01:21:47,778 --> 01:21:49,280
I really don't have it.

934
01:21:51,490 --> 01:21:53,701
You were the only friend she had.

935
01:21:53,784 --> 01:21:54,952
Tell me now.

936
01:21:55,578 --> 01:21:58,831
We're busy guys, okay?

937
01:21:59,290 --> 01:22:01,959
So answer us
before we get mean.

938
01:22:02,084 --> 01:22:04,670
I don't know, assholes!

939
01:22:07,173 --> 01:22:08,466
Cute.

940
01:22:08,591 --> 01:22:12,845
You know,
your face looks unbalanced.

941
01:22:13,846 --> 01:22:16,682
You can use a little symmetry,

942
01:22:17,099 --> 01:22:18,100
couldn't you?

943
01:22:18,476 --> 01:22:20,853
Spilling blood over
a stupid cell phone.

944
01:22:20,978 --> 01:22:23,856
Where's Ah-jung's phone,
you fucking bitch!

945
01:22:23,981 --> 01:22:24,982
Tell us, you slut!

946
01:22:32,657 --> 01:22:35,743
Who's this fooling around
in my workplace?

947
01:22:35,868 --> 01:22:38,454
What the fuck are you doing here?

948
01:22:38,579 --> 01:22:40,581
I said what are you doing, fuckers!

949
01:22:40,665 --> 01:22:43,376
Answer me! Get out of here!

950
01:22:44,043 --> 01:22:45,670
Hey, push me.

951
01:22:45,962 --> 01:22:48,381
Stop! Stop!

952
01:22:52,593 --> 01:22:55,054
If I see you back here,
you're dead!

953
01:22:58,307 --> 01:23:01,310
Yeah, so where are you now?

954
01:23:03,062 --> 01:23:04,772
I need your help.

955
01:23:05,022 --> 01:23:07,358
Can you come over here now?

956
01:23:09,193 --> 01:23:10,653
Yeah, now.

957
01:23:56,866 --> 01:23:59,702
Who are these little shits?

958
01:24:00,077 --> 01:24:00,953
Let go of me.

959
01:24:01,078 --> 01:24:03,080
And who the fuck are you?

960
01:24:03,205 --> 01:24:05,791
You in your stupid fucking hat?

961
01:24:05,875 --> 01:24:06,959
You shithead.

962
01:24:07,877 --> 01:24:10,212
Why are you looking for
Ah-jung's cell phone?

963
01:24:21,849 --> 01:24:23,976
Were you one of
her boyfriends, too?

964
01:24:31,859 --> 01:24:33,694
Rice Cake Girl, for sure.

965
01:24:33,778 --> 01:24:34,779
Rice Cake?

966
01:24:35,404 --> 01:24:37,406
Don't you know that?

967
01:24:37,573 --> 01:24:39,867
Give her rice and fuck her.

968
01:24:40,493 --> 01:24:43,329
Have your cake,
and eat it, too.

969
01:24:43,412 --> 01:24:47,124
Ah-jung, you poor thing...

970
01:24:47,291 --> 01:24:48,459
I know things are hard, but still...

971
01:24:48,584 --> 01:24:51,879
How could you
take rice instead of cash?

972
01:24:51,962 --> 01:24:55,758
Fuck! If the Schoolgirl Pussy
for Money Union finds out,

973
01:24:55,883 --> 01:24:57,134
I'll get expelled!

974
01:24:57,301 --> 01:24:58,594
If you take rice one more time,
you're dead.

975
01:24:58,677 --> 01:25:02,056
Cut it Out, dude. Fuck it all.

976
01:25:02,139 --> 01:25:04,683
You're the bastard
who paid her in rice!

977
01:25:04,767 --> 01:25:07,311
Get out! That was crazy JP
who stole rice

978
01:25:07,394 --> 01:25:09,146
- from the sanatorium.
- Fuck off, asshole!

979
01:25:09,313 --> 01:25:10,773
It's true!

980
01:25:10,898 --> 01:25:13,901
Pretty Ah-jung had
turned all cold,

981
01:25:13,984 --> 01:25:16,153
and you kept insisting.

982
01:25:29,291 --> 01:25:30,960
Ma'am, listen to this.

983
01:25:32,878 --> 01:25:34,505
It's in my blood.

984
01:25:34,588 --> 01:25:37,174
I should have been a fuckin' cop.

985
01:25:38,884 --> 01:25:40,803
Moon Ah-jung's cell-phone...

986
01:25:41,887 --> 01:25:46,809
If those pictures ever get out,
lots of guys will suffer.

987
01:25:49,061 --> 01:25:51,939
That phone is an atomic bomb.

988
01:25:52,773 --> 01:25:56,652
She photographed them all
with her pervert phone,

989
01:25:57,236 --> 01:25:58,779
those guys she fucked.

990
01:25:59,071 --> 01:26:01,574
It must be
two soccer teams or more.

991
01:26:03,409 --> 01:26:04,660
So,

992
01:26:04,785 --> 01:26:06,495
were you on the soccer team too?

993
01:26:06,579 --> 01:26:09,415
How could you say that?

994
01:26:10,082 --> 01:26:13,669
But I was actually
quite close to her,

995
01:26:13,794 --> 01:26:14,962
in a spiritual way.

996
01:26:16,589 --> 01:26:19,091
Back then I asked her.

997
01:26:19,592 --> 01:26:20,801
Hey Ah-jung,

998
01:26:21,594 --> 01:26:24,555
did you really take pictures
of all those guys?

999
01:26:25,389 --> 01:26:28,559
Sure I did.

1000
01:26:28,851 --> 01:26:30,561
Hey, am I in there too?

1001
01:26:31,562 --> 01:26:34,231
Why? Are you scared?

1002
01:26:35,691 --> 01:26:37,860
You think I'll blackmail you?

1003
01:26:38,569 --> 01:26:42,156
Give me a break.
Me scared of you?

1004
01:26:45,576 --> 01:26:46,785
I'm sick of it...

1005
01:26:49,163 --> 01:26:50,164
What?

1006
01:26:50,998 --> 01:26:52,166
Sick of cocks?

1007
01:26:55,586 --> 01:26:57,588
I hate all this.

1008
01:26:59,965 --> 01:27:02,384
I should throw
this damn phone away.

1009
01:27:04,136 --> 01:27:06,972
A perfectly good phone?

1010
01:27:07,973 --> 01:27:10,476
Just delete the photos!

1011
01:27:13,687 --> 01:27:15,147
I don't want to.

1012
01:27:23,489 --> 01:27:26,992
I'm sure
he's there among the photos.

1013
01:27:27,076 --> 01:27:28,786
The guy who killed her.

1014
01:27:30,496 --> 01:27:32,581
But that idiot Yoon Do-joon

1015
01:27:32,665 --> 01:27:34,333
<i>sure got fucked over.</i>

1016
01:27:38,170 --> 01:27:40,047
Yeah, that retard

1017
01:27:40,172 --> 01:27:43,759
never even saw her panties,
and then he gets blamed.

1018
01:27:44,885 --> 01:27:45,761
That's enough.

1019
01:27:45,886 --> 01:27:48,347
Hey, I heard that
Do-joon sleeps with his mom?

1020
01:27:48,514 --> 01:27:49,348
I said shut up!

1021
01:27:49,515 --> 01:27:52,601
Does he just sleep?
Or does he fuck her?

1022
01:28:22,256 --> 01:28:23,257
What the hell?

1023
01:28:24,091 --> 01:28:26,510
Who are you?

1024
01:28:33,100 --> 01:28:35,602
Wait, don't move.

1025
01:28:51,160 --> 01:28:52,244
Tell me.

1026
01:28:53,078 --> 01:28:57,082
Is that really all you know
about the cell phone?

1027
01:28:58,375 --> 01:29:01,587
Not again...

1028
01:29:01,712 --> 01:29:07,509
Why don't you all leave me alone
for Christ's sake!

1029
01:29:12,056 --> 01:29:13,682
Well...

1030
01:29:14,850 --> 01:29:19,980
I remember
her saying something...

1031
01:29:20,064 --> 01:29:21,690
Like...

1032
01:29:22,441 --> 01:29:26,153
If I traded this cell phone
for rice liquor,

1033
01:29:26,278 --> 01:29:27,988
how many bottles would I get?

1034
01:29:28,989 --> 01:29:30,783
What, are you drinking
rice liquor now too?

1035
01:30:04,691 --> 01:30:06,068
Mom!

1036
01:30:06,693 --> 01:30:08,278
Mom! Visit!

1037
01:30:09,071 --> 01:30:12,366
Mom! Visit!

1038
01:30:12,699 --> 01:30:14,451
I remember! I remember!

1039
01:30:14,618 --> 01:30:17,704
Mom! Call mom!

1040
01:30:19,164 --> 01:30:20,332
Mom!

1041
01:30:20,874 --> 01:30:22,876
Granny!

1042
01:30:27,589 --> 01:30:29,591
Are you home?

1043
01:30:35,806 --> 01:30:36,974
Granny!

1044
01:30:58,787 --> 01:30:59,955
Granny!

1045
01:31:05,377 --> 01:31:07,254
Ah-jung sent you!

1046
01:31:12,885 --> 01:31:13,969
The money?

1047
01:31:29,276 --> 01:31:31,778
Is that it?

1048
01:31:32,779 --> 01:31:34,364
Is that all she sent?

1049
01:31:36,283 --> 01:31:40,162
By the way,
where's Ah-jung's cell phone?

1050
01:31:41,705 --> 01:31:42,706
The phone?

1051
01:31:43,999 --> 01:31:51,381
I already traded it for rice liquor.

1052
01:31:53,383 --> 01:31:55,302
You're lying.

1053
01:31:56,887 --> 01:32:00,432
Ah-jung told me
to be sure to bring it back.

1054
01:32:03,185 --> 01:32:05,771
That crazy tramp
keeps taking it back.

1055
01:33:15,632 --> 01:33:17,092
Look closely.

1056
01:33:20,554 --> 01:33:23,807
No, no...

1057
01:33:27,102 --> 01:33:28,562
He had white hair,

1058
01:33:29,813 --> 01:33:30,981
an old man.

1059
01:33:55,672 --> 01:33:58,008
I've seen this man before.

1060
01:35:04,991 --> 01:35:05,992
Hello?

1061
01:35:48,118 --> 01:35:49,661
Is anyone home?

1062
01:35:57,377 --> 01:35:58,545
Who are you?

1063
01:35:59,546 --> 01:36:01,173
Do you see me?

1064
01:36:02,758 --> 01:36:04,468
Have a seat.

1065
01:36:05,761 --> 01:36:08,555
But why have you come
to a place like this?

1066
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:13,852
I'm from a volunteer organization
called Hyeminwon.

1067
01:36:14,561 --> 01:36:18,398
We provide free medical checks
for elderly people living alone.

1068
01:36:18,482 --> 01:36:20,275
For free?

1069
01:36:21,693 --> 01:36:24,404
We also provide
free acupuncture...

1070
01:36:24,988 --> 01:36:27,073
All sorts of things.

1071
01:36:28,742 --> 01:36:30,660
I've heard of them, Hyeminwon.

1072
01:36:31,286 --> 01:36:33,747
Since you're here,
let's have a chat.

1073
01:36:34,998 --> 01:36:37,292
It's cold.

1074
01:36:42,839 --> 01:36:44,382
I've seen you before.

1075
01:36:44,841 --> 01:36:46,176
I don't think so.

1076
01:36:48,386 --> 01:36:49,763
Maybe not.

1077
01:36:50,764 --> 01:36:52,766
Anyway stay awhile
now that you're here.

1078
01:36:53,475 --> 01:36:57,979
- You can sleep over if you want.
- You're quite a joker.

1079
01:36:58,063 --> 01:37:00,857
Are you sick anywhere?

1080
01:37:01,566 --> 01:37:03,652
No place in particular.

1081
01:37:03,735 --> 01:37:06,738
But my heart's
not so good these days.

1082
01:37:07,739 --> 01:37:09,366
Your heart?

1083
01:37:09,741 --> 01:37:14,371
Actually not long ago,
I saw something I shouldn't have.

1084
01:37:14,496 --> 01:37:17,374
At my age it was a shock.

1085
01:37:17,666 --> 01:37:20,377
I felt it in my whole body.

1086
01:37:20,502 --> 01:37:22,003
It's good that I came.

1087
01:37:22,087 --> 01:37:23,505
There's a meridian point

1088
01:37:23,588 --> 01:37:26,591
that can loosen the knots
in your heart

1089
01:37:26,675 --> 01:37:30,387
and clear all horrible memories
from your mind.

1090
01:37:30,512 --> 01:37:31,555
On the thigh...

1091
01:37:31,930 --> 01:37:34,850
Oh, should I take off my pants?

1092
01:37:34,933 --> 01:37:38,478
Just a minute.
I need to prepare first.

1093
01:37:41,189 --> 01:37:42,190
Anyway,

1094
01:37:43,191 --> 01:37:45,861
what did you see,
a traffic accident?

1095
01:37:47,362 --> 01:37:49,489
You're curious, aren't you?

1096
01:37:50,198 --> 01:37:56,371
I haven't told a soul about this.

1097
01:37:57,205 --> 01:38:00,792
Tell me.
I'll make sure it doesn't hurt.

1098
01:38:01,960 --> 01:38:05,380
You remember that incident
in this town a while back?

1099
01:38:05,672 --> 01:38:07,173
The murder case.

1100
01:38:08,466 --> 01:38:11,469
When that young girl was killed.

1101
01:38:13,263 --> 01:38:17,392
The house where it took place
had been abandoned for a long time.

1102
01:38:19,185 --> 01:38:23,857
I happened to be there that night.

1103
01:38:28,945 --> 01:38:31,197
Careful, it's hot.

1104
01:38:32,782 --> 01:38:37,287
Actually, I sometimes go there.

1105
01:38:37,829 --> 01:38:40,373
It's quiet there,
being empty and all.

1106
01:38:42,667 --> 01:38:46,755
But that night, that girl came in.

1107
01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:50,967
And behind her,

1108
01:38:51,092 --> 01:38:54,095
some strange guy
was following her...

1109
01:38:54,179 --> 01:38:56,848
You don't like guys?

1110
01:39:05,774 --> 01:39:07,776
You don't like guys?

1111
01:39:30,382 --> 01:39:31,383
Hey!

1112
01:39:35,387 --> 01:39:36,680
Do you know me?

1113
01:39:37,973 --> 01:39:39,224
No...

1114
01:39:39,766 --> 01:39:41,393
I said, do you know me?

1115
01:39:44,229 --> 01:39:45,188
Nope.

1116
01:39:45,271 --> 01:39:46,481
Then why...

1117
01:39:49,192 --> 01:39:50,860
I hate guys.

1118
01:39:54,197 --> 01:39:57,033
So don't talk to me like that,
you stupid retard.

1119
01:41:02,557 --> 01:41:05,560
Shit!

1120
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:13,401
Hey!

1121
01:41:16,154 --> 01:41:17,989
Why are you lying there?

1122
01:41:31,461 --> 01:41:35,757
Hey! Are you hurt?

1123
01:41:35,882 --> 01:41:36,883
No!

1124
01:41:36,966 --> 01:41:39,052
You must have seen it wrong!

1125
01:41:39,385 --> 01:41:40,678
What's gotten into you?

1126
01:41:40,762 --> 01:41:42,889
You must have seen it wrong.

1127
01:41:42,972 --> 01:41:46,684
They say Yoon Do-joon is innocent,
that he'll be released soon.

1128
01:41:46,768 --> 01:41:48,603
They're going to
re-open the investigation.

1129
01:41:48,686 --> 01:41:49,771
Really?

1130
01:41:50,313 --> 01:41:53,608
That's what the cops said.

1131
01:41:53,691 --> 01:41:55,318
That's nonsense!

1132
01:41:55,401 --> 01:41:58,154
I saw his face with my own eyes.

1133
01:41:58,655 --> 01:42:00,949
It was him for sure!
Yoon Do-joon.

1134
01:42:01,032 --> 01:42:03,284
He threw that rock

1135
01:42:04,577 --> 01:42:08,873
and he made
these weird movements.

1136
01:42:10,375 --> 01:42:13,169
How could they let him out now?

1137
01:42:13,503 --> 01:42:17,048
Anyway they caught the right guy.

1138
01:42:17,674 --> 01:42:21,302
I better call and report it myself.
Those idiots...

1139
01:42:25,598 --> 01:42:27,809
Where's the number?

1140
01:42:34,566 --> 01:42:35,775
No!

1141
01:42:36,651 --> 01:42:41,781
Never, no! No!

1142
01:42:43,491 --> 01:42:45,493
No way, you trash!

1143
01:42:53,668 --> 01:42:56,671
You're not even worth
the dirt on my son's toenail.

1144
01:43:33,708 --> 01:43:38,755
What do I do?

1145
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:41,132
What do I do? Mom...

1146
01:51:35,189 --> 01:51:36,190
Ma'am!

1147
01:51:37,733 --> 01:51:39,193
We caught the killer.

1148
01:51:43,280 --> 01:51:44,573
Do you remember?

1149
01:51:45,074 --> 01:51:47,493
I think I mentioned it before.

1150
01:51:48,577 --> 01:51:50,996
JP, who ran away
from the sanatorium.

1151
01:51:51,497 --> 01:51:54,667
He was... Where was it?

1152
01:51:54,750 --> 01:51:56,585
- Mt. Dogye.
- That's right.

1153
01:51:56,669 --> 01:51:57,670
They caught him there.

1154
01:51:57,753 --> 01:52:00,381
Anyway, on his shirt,

1155
01:52:00,464 --> 01:52:03,551
they found some bloodstains.

1156
01:52:03,634 --> 01:52:07,388
They analyzed it
and it matched with Moon Ah-jung,

1157
01:52:07,471 --> 01:52:09,390
so it's game over.

1158
01:52:09,473 --> 01:52:13,269
A golf ball can't
compare to evidence like that.

1159
01:52:13,644 --> 01:52:18,107
Why did he do it?

1160
01:52:19,567 --> 01:52:22,486
Well, he's not
what you call normal.

1161
01:52:23,112 --> 01:52:27,575
It could have ended
in attempted rape, don't you think?

1162
01:52:27,658 --> 01:52:31,829
Sure. But according to him,

1163
01:52:32,246 --> 01:52:35,541
it was all because of love.

1164
01:52:35,666 --> 01:52:37,668
He says he's Ah-jung's boyfriend.

1165
01:52:38,461 --> 01:52:40,546
And the bloodstains,

1166
01:52:40,671 --> 01:52:44,091
he says the two of them
were going at it passionately

1167
01:52:44,175 --> 01:52:48,095
and then she got a nosebleed.

1168
01:52:48,179 --> 01:52:54,101
Wow, that kid
can think pretty fast.

1169
01:52:55,686 --> 01:52:56,854
But ma'am,

1170
01:52:57,688 --> 01:53:00,024
Do you really
need to go and see JP?

1171
01:53:33,849 --> 01:53:37,186
Do you have parents?

1172
01:53:47,488 --> 01:53:49,365
Have you got a mom?

1173
01:54:11,929 --> 01:54:13,347
Don't cry.

1174
01:54:17,935 --> 01:54:18,936
Ma'am.

1175
01:55:13,282 --> 01:55:14,575
Yoon Do-joon!

1179
01:55:41,602 --> 01:55:43,604
Snap the picture.

1180
01:55:43,979 --> 01:55:44,980
Blow!

1181
01:55:46,482 --> 01:55:48,609
Ready, one, two,

1182
01:55:51,654 --> 01:55:53,948
- Congratulations!
- Here too.

1183
01:55:55,866 --> 01:55:57,660
When did you get this car?

1184
01:55:57,743 --> 01:55:59,578
I received some money recently.

1185
01:55:59,662 --> 01:56:01,872
Cool, huh? I ride it every day.

1186
01:56:02,873 --> 01:56:04,291
Does the tofu taste good?

1187
01:56:04,875 --> 01:56:05,960
Yeah.

1188
01:56:08,879 --> 01:56:11,465
What...

1189
01:56:11,757 --> 01:56:13,217
You didn't hear?

1190
01:56:13,467 --> 01:56:16,220
The junk collector's place
burned down.

1191
01:56:16,470 --> 01:56:19,223
They said he died.

1192
01:56:41,578 --> 01:56:43,038
Eat up.

1193
01:56:44,790 --> 01:56:46,500
Have some deodeok root, too.

1194
01:56:48,794 --> 01:56:52,589
What happened to the chestnuts?
I put in several.

1195
01:56:57,302 --> 01:56:58,387
Mom.

1196
01:57:00,681 --> 01:57:04,268
I've been... thinking.

1197
01:57:05,853 --> 01:57:07,062
About what?

1198
01:57:09,857 --> 01:57:11,775
That crazy JP,

1199
01:57:13,277 --> 01:57:15,863
Why'd he put her body up
on the roof,

1200
01:57:16,488 --> 01:57:17,948
Way up high?

1201
01:57:19,283 --> 01:57:21,577
Why think about that?

1202
01:57:28,959 --> 01:57:30,502
So I think,

1203
01:57:32,963 --> 01:57:34,840
maybe it was
so people would see her?

1204
01:57:37,551 --> 01:57:40,679
She was bleeding.

1205
01:57:40,763 --> 01:57:42,765
She needed to go to the hospital.

1206
01:57:45,059 --> 01:57:49,772
So he put her in a place
where people could see her fast.

1207
01:57:54,068 --> 01:57:57,404
I bet that's it.

1208
01:58:35,400 --> 01:58:36,902
<i>Attention, y'all.</i>

1209
01:58:36,985 --> 01:58:42,282
<i>Passengers on the
Thank-You-Parents Bus Tour,</i>

1210
01:58:42,366 --> 01:58:46,662
Mom, take this on the bus to eat.

1211
01:58:46,787 --> 01:58:49,164
You didn't have to buy so much.

1212
01:58:49,289 --> 01:58:52,668
You can share it
with the other parents.

1213
01:58:52,793 --> 01:58:54,878
Don't leave it behind.

1214
01:58:58,590 --> 01:58:59,591
Oh, I forgot,

1215
01:59:01,051 --> 01:59:03,387
Mom. Here.

1216
01:59:03,512 --> 01:59:04,513
What?

1217
01:59:06,306 --> 01:59:07,516
I have something for you.

1218
01:59:07,599 --> 01:59:08,684
What is it?

1219
01:59:25,492 --> 01:59:31,498
Well... I found this at
the junk collector's burnt house.

1220
01:59:36,587 --> 01:59:41,675
How could you
leave this lying around?

1221
01:59:51,768 --> 01:59:53,145
Mom...

1222
02:00:14,082 --> 02:00:17,252
Hurry up!
