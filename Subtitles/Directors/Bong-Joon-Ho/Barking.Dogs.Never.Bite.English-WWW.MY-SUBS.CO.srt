79
00:15:45,263 --> 00:15:53,562

86
00:16:15,124 --> 00:16:20,253

88

It was about the best husbands.
You know what took 1st and 2nd?

98
00:18:07,854 --> 00:18:11,733
Doctors and lawyers.
And 48th on the list is...

99
00:18:11,983 --> 00:18:13,651
- Miners!
- That's right.

100
00:18:14,318 --> 00:18:18,156
49th is farmers
and 50th <i>is...</i>

101
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:22,033
- What?
- Humanities grad students.

102
00:18:22,075 --> 00:18:25,621
- Are we the last on the list?
- What a shame!

103
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:32,752
- Is it too red?
- This is our department shirt.

104
00:18:32,835 --> 00:18:35,463
Not again!
Another dishcloth!

105
00:18:35,546 --> 00:18:37,215
It's not very pretty.

106
00:18:41,092 --> 00:18:45,056
- Do we have to pay for it?
- Yeah. 8 dollars.

107
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,976
Can I get one for free?

108
00:18:49,059 --> 00:18:52,562
It includes drinks as well.

109
00:18:52,937 --> 00:18:56,942
- Let me pay for you.
- The color isn't very good.

110
00:18:58,233 --> 00:19:01,363
Did you see Jun-pyo?

111
00:19:02,113 --> 00:19:05,240

I'll call you back.

116
00:19:45,736 --> 00:19:49,615
Where have you been?
I'm about to go home.

117
00:19:49,698 --> 00:19:53,328
Thank God you're here.
Get me some tissue.

118
00:19:53,619 --> 00:19:56,871
Just a second.

119
00:20:05,631 --> 00:20:06,798
Here.

120
00:20:09,842 --> 00:20:11,218
Did you think about
what I said?

121
00:20:13,971 --> 00:20:20,811
Kung-min bribed the dean
when he was studying in Germany.

122
00:20:22,895 --> 00:20:27,942
That's why he's a professor.

123
00:20:28,693 --> 00:20:31,904
I'm just not a good lobbyist.

124
00:20:32,321 --> 00:20:33,656
You know that?

125
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:41,413
The other night he was...

126
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:48,627
This isn't very funny.
I shouldn't be laughing.

127
00:20:50,214 --> 00:20:55,176
He was drinking with the dean.

128
00:21:00,181 --> 00:21:02,099
The dean drinks like a madman.

129
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,311
He gets smashed out of his gourd.

130
00:21:06,352 --> 00:21:09,648
Kung-min doesn't drink.

131
00:21:10,274 --> 00:21:12,901
But he got plastered that night.

132
00:21:14,194 --> 00:21:16,446
Whiskey and all.

133
00:21:22,952 --> 00:21:26,245
He goes to take the subway.

134
00:21:26,663 --> 00:21:32,543
Projectile vomit,
all over the tracks.

135
00:21:32,627 --> 00:21:33,753

136
00:21:34,171 --> 00:21:36,255

137
00:21:36,381 --> 00:21:41,970
Even a Ph. D's head is no match
for a train.

138

140
00:21:49,768 --> 00:21:52,269
That's awful!

141
00:21:53,437 --> 00:22:00,278
He studied abroad and all.
What a waste.

142
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:07,244
But that's good for you.

143
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:09,453
What?

144
00:22:11,412 --> 00:22:14,291
His position is available.

145
00:22:14,999 --> 00:22:19,755
If you play your cards right,
it's yours.

146
00:22:25,008 --> 00:22:27,929
You should go see the dean.

147
00:22:28,887 --> 00:22:31,224
I should?

148
00:22:31,515 --> 00:22:36,186
Get $10,000 ready.

149
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:41,024
- $10,000?
- Hey, it's not much.

150
00:22:41,732 --> 00:22:44,736
Prepare it.
That's what it costs.

151
00:22:46,196 --> 00:22:47,780
But it's too much.

152
00:22:47,947 --> 00:22:54,744
This is your last shot.
Don't let it go.

153
00:22:55,787 --> 00:22:58,124

$10,000?

162
00:23:53,132 --> 00:23:58,637
You can't really call it
a bribe.

163
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:06,186
Think of it as a necessary
business expense.

164
00:24:08,356 --> 00:24:14,237
Just an allowance for
an old man.

165

What's wrong with that?

166

00:27:20,076 --> 00:27:21,743
Not here yet?

173
00:27:52,355 --> 00:27:55,898
Leave a message at the beep.

174
00:27:56,608 --> 00:28:00,945
Be here in 10 minutes
or you're dead.

175
00:28:47,531 --> 00:28:49,742
How's it going?

176
00:28:49,825 --> 00:28:52,619
What are you doing down here?

177
00:28:59,625 --> 00:29:03,129
It smells great.

178
00:29:05,506 --> 00:29:08,968
You having a feast alone?

179
00:29:09,134 --> 00:29:13,180
I didn't want to dirty
the office.

180
00:29:13,388 --> 00:29:18,142
- What soup is this?
- It's nothing.

181
00:29:18,392 --> 00:29:23,022
What are you doing here?

182
00:29:25,858 --> 00:29:36,951
The other day some kids got
caught smoking weed down here.

183
00:29:37,284 --> 00:29:38,828
Is that right?

184
00:29:39,371 --> 00:29:41,581
- You didn't hear?
- No.

185
00:29:42,832 --> 00:29:44,291
You know what's worse?

186
00:29:44,624 --> 00:29:49,838
This residents' representative
stormed into my office...

187
00:29:50,089 --> 00:29:57,178
...and blamed it on
our janitors.

188
00:29:58,764 --> 00:30:04,811
The bulb must have blown out.

189
00:30:05,688 --> 00:30:09,524
When it's done,
we'll take it to the office.

190
00:30:26,372 --> 00:30:28,165
You know what?

191
00:30:30,001 --> 00:30:41,720
I keep hearing noises
in this basement.

192
00:30:43,431 --> 00:30:46,349
It must be the pipes.

193
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:54,940
You ever heard of Boiler Kim?

194
00:30:56,776 --> 00:30:58,778
Boiler Kim?

195
00:30:59,903 --> 00:31:08,746
Back in 1988,
construction was booming.

196
00:31:09,121 --> 00:31:12,248
Everything was built slapdash.

197
00:31:13,124 --> 00:31:18,588
They built this apartment then.

198
00:31:20,464 --> 00:31:25,844
After people moved in,

199
00:31:27,763 --> 00:31:33,309
we had problems with
the heating.

200
00:31:33,935 --> 00:31:38,356
So we had guys over to fix it.

201
00:31:38,648 --> 00:31:42,401
But nobody knew what was wrong.

202
00:31:43,194 --> 00:31:48,574
So we called up Boiler Kim.

203
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:59,125
He was a legendary figure
in the business.

204
00:31:59,625 --> 00:32:05,757
He came up all the way
from Mokpo.

205
00:32:06,131 --> 00:32:15,599
He took a look and started
to chuckle.

206
00:32:16,224 --> 00:32:19,771
Then he set to work.

207
00:32:19,978 --> 00:32:26,567
10 minutes later, it was
working like a top.

208
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:33,408
And he said,
"It's spinning."

209
00:32:33,616 --> 00:32:35,826
Spinning?

210
00:32:35,951 --> 00:32:41,081
It's what they say down in Mokpo.
It was his trademark.

211
00:32:41,873 --> 00:32:54,844
After he fixed boilers,
he said, "It's spinning" to people.

212
00:32:56,094 --> 00:33:05,104
Everybody was delighted and
wanted to drink with him.

213
00:33:05,229 --> 00:33:15,361
Then he turned and yelled,
"You bastards!"

214
00:33:16,489 --> 00:33:20,325
Everybody was speechless.

215
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:24,955
And he asked,
"How much did you steal?"

216
00:33:27,081 --> 00:33:35,047
They used really cheap materials
and embezzled the money.

217
00:33:35,799 --> 00:33:40,553
Boiler Kim knew.

218
00:33:42,138 --> 00:33:48,811
He fixed boilers with
love and care.

219
00:33:48,978 --> 00:33:53,606
So he knew they'd bought
cheap materials.

220
00:33:54,316 --> 00:34:00,988
Then a fight broke out.

221
00:34:01,364 --> 00:34:12,247
I don't know who it was,
but somebody pushed him back.

222
00:34:13,583 --> 00:34:17,837
He fell backward...

223
00:34:18,129 --> 00:34:29,097
and hit his head on a nail
in the wall.

224
00:34:29,849 --> 00:34:33,894
He died on the spot.

225
00:34:34,186 --> 00:34:41,944
Nobody knew what to do.

226
00:34:42,944 --> 00:34:52,119
They decided to take the secret
to their graves.

227
00:34:53,120 --> 00:35:04,130
So they put his body in the wall
and cemented it over.

228
00:35:04,214 --> 00:35:08,300
It's the one way back there.

229
00:35:11,095 --> 00:35:14,974
Over that wall,
there's a boiler room.

230
00:35:15,307 --> 00:35:21,605
His body lies there between
the walls.

231
00:35:23,482 --> 00:35:27,110
Here's what's even scarier.

232
00:35:27,235 --> 00:35:35,868
Ever since, it makes a noise
every night.

233
00:35:36,035 --> 00:35:37,662
Every night?

234
00:35:37,829 --> 00:35:48,922
No sound at all during the day,
but it hums at night.

235
00:35:49,089 --> 00:35:52,300
Like somebody crying?

236
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:57,221
No. Were you listening to me?

237
00:35:58,223 --> 00:36:11,985
Like the way he used to talk
"spinn-ing, -ing."

238
00:36:23,537 --> 00:36:26,789
It's done.
Let's get out of here.

239
00:37:43,779 --> 00:37:45,614
'Boiler Kim'?

240
00:38:52,675 --> 00:38:53,802
<i>Hello...</i>

241
00:38:53,885 --> 00:38:58,806
<i>I'm sorry to call this late.
Is this 274-3373?</i>

242
00:38:58,848 --> 00:39:00,391
Yes it is.

243
00:39:00,808 --> 00:39:05,896
- <i>Mind if I ask your name?</i>
- <i>What?</i>

244
00:39:06,021 --> 00:39:10,859
- <i>Your name?</i>
- <i>It's</i> Park <i>Hyun-nam.</i>

245
00:39:11,234 --> 00:39:13,570
<i>This is right, then!</i>

246
00:39:13,862 --> 00:39:17,657
<i>Sorry to call at this late hour.
This is K BS TV.</i>

247
00:39:18,824 --> 00:39:23,204
- <i>What?</i>
- <i>I'm from 'This is Your Life. '</i>

248
00:39:23,537 --> 00:39:26,583
<i>You went to elementary school
with singer Yoo Seung-jun, right?</i>

249
00:39:26,666 --> 00:39:28,709
Who?

250
00:39:29,044 --> 00:39:34,216
<i>He's looking for his first love
which is you, Miss. Park.</i>

251
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:38,383
Yoo Seung-jun is looking for me?

252
00:39:38,676 --> 00:39:45,433
<i>We're behind schedule.
Can you come to the station?</i>

253
00:39:46,602 --> 00:39:47,811
Right now?

254
00:39:47,936 --> 00:39:52,690
<i>Would that be possible?</i>

255
00:39:54,234 --> 00:40:00,906
- <i>What should</i> I <i>do?</i>
- <i>Grab a taxi. We'll pay for it.</i>

256
00:40:01,406 --> 00:40:04,368
Is a limousine taxi okay?

257
00:40:04,451 --> 00:40:06,912
<i>You bet.
Just get yourself here quickly.</i>

258
00:40:06,995 --> 00:40:10,414
- Okay.
- <i>Move your ass, will you?</i>

259
00:40:11,416 --> 00:40:13,376
- Wait a second...
- <i>What?</i>

260
00:40:13,918 --> 00:40:17,504
Why are you being so rude,
all of a sudden?

261
00:40:17,587 --> 00:40:21,466
<i>This is a crank call, idiot!</i>

262
00:40:28,265 --> 00:40:31,601
What did you do this time?

263
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:33,727
Go back to bed!

264
00:40:33,811 --> 00:40:39,650
- You're unbelievable.
- Shut up!

265
00:40:45,948 --> 00:40:49,995
- Hyun-nam, are you up?
- No, I am sleeping!

266
00:40:51,369 --> 00:40:55,832
- Who was it?
- Nobody...

267
00:41:27,153 --> 00:41:28,863
Did you eat?

268
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:44,710
Jun-pyo told me that...

269
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:51,467
I didn't mean to be late!

270
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:56,012
Enter your pin-number please.

271
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:05,396
Your balance is 100 dollars.

272
00:42:16,698 --> 00:42:21,536
Can I have your attention,
please?

273
00:42:22,662 --> 00:42:25,457
We're looking for a dog.

274
00:42:25,959 --> 00:42:33,507
A white dog with a red necklace...

275
00:42:33,923 --> 00:42:39,886
Dogs aren't allowed here, right?

276
00:42:40,053 --> 00:42:42,554
Yeah, that's right.

277
00:42:42,805 --> 00:42:48,395
But nobody follows the rule.

278
00:42:49,938 --> 00:42:53,525
Nobody in this country
follows the rules.

279
00:42:53,566 --> 00:42:57,487
Yeah, ever since the liberation.

280
00:42:58,738 --> 00:43:03,492
They must be all millionaires,
raising those expensive dogs.

281
00:43:04,911 --> 00:43:09,539
Right.
Dogs eat better than I do.

282
00:43:10,291 --> 00:43:12,917
Let's go, go...

283
00:44:57,013 --> 00:44:58,224
Sweetie?

284
00:45:03,311 --> 00:45:04,854
Sweetie?

285
00:45:07,023 --> 00:45:12,445
Sweetie!

286
00:45:25,874 --> 00:45:26,999
Excuse me!

287
00:45:31,629 --> 00:45:32,548
Mi-jung!

288
00:45:32,631 --> 00:45:36,050
Look at you!
You look so funny in that.

289
00:45:36,175 --> 00:45:37,511
I was jogging-

290
00:45:38,428 --> 00:45:42,557
- You live around here?
- No, I teach a kid.

291
00:45:42,849 --> 00:45:45,017
- I've got bills to pay, you know.
- I see.

292
00:45:45,809 --> 00:45:50,106
What a cutie!
I didn't know you liked dogs.

293
00:45:50,231 --> 00:45:52,899
I love them, too.

294
00:45:53,024 --> 00:45:55,860
- I'm kind <i>of...</i>
- Have a cup of coffee with me.

295
00:45:56,069 --> 00:45:57,529
It's on me.

296
00:45:57,737 --> 00:46:00,656
But I was jogging-

297
00:46:00,738 --> 00:46:04,785
You must have been busy lately.
I know what you're up to.

298
00:46:04,869 --> 00:46:06,912
- I'm not busy.
- I heard you'll be a professor.

299
00:46:06,995 --> 00:46:11,750
Congratulations!
Hire me as your assistant.

300
00:46:11,834 --> 00:46:13,625
That will be the day.

301
00:46:14,086 --> 00:46:17,088
There's a cafe over there.
Come on.

302
00:46:17,172 --> 00:46:24,761
Now here is what was
recorded on CCTV.

303
00:46:30,434 --> 00:46:31,435
That's her.

304
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:35,272
Did you see that?
She beat off a bank robber.

305
00:46:36,398 --> 00:46:37,773
What a girl!

306
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,777
She's tough.

307
00:46:44,739 --> 00:46:46,324
That must have hurt.

308
00:46:47,617 --> 00:46:49,660
What nerves she has!

309
00:46:49,785 --> 00:46:50,995
Look at that!

310
00:46:51,078 --> 00:46:53,163
She got smacked by
the knife's handle.

311
00:46:53,289 --> 00:46:56,416
- Lucky it's the handle.
- Wow! She's like Zena!

312
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:59,795
Why'd she bother?
It's not her money.

313
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:03,465
How can you say that?

314
00:47:04,089 --> 00:47:10,721
I'd have just given it to him.
I mean, it's the bank's money.

315
00:47:21,065 --> 00:47:25,068
But now she's famous.

316
00:47:26,403 --> 00:47:29,279
Not everybody gets on TV.

317
00:47:31,533 --> 00:47:35,827
Get a job at the bank and
catch a robber.

318
00:47:43,669 --> 00:47:49,339
The bank would never hire me.

319
00:47:50,591 --> 00:47:54,595
Robbers never come here.

320
00:47:55,429 --> 00:47:58,516
Boring, isn't it?

321
00:48:05,981 --> 00:48:08,899
Let's go for a smoke.

322
00:48:11,361 --> 00:48:14,530
I love smoking on the roof.

323
00:48:15,532 --> 00:48:17,367
The smell doesn't get on
my clothes.

324
00:48:18,034 --> 00:48:21,286
- Did you get caught?
- No.

325
00:48:25,207 --> 00:48:28,876
But my aunt suspects it.

326
00:48:30,588 --> 00:48:33,214
What? I can't see anything.

327
00:48:34,048 --> 00:48:37,343
You only sell cheap toys.

328
00:48:39,970 --> 00:48:41,806
The other way!

329
00:48:45,726 --> 00:48:51,065
- Oh, now it works!
- Watch it. Very expensive.

330
00:48:52,149 --> 00:48:59,488
I can see trees on
the mountain.

331
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:04,577
- You want to go hiking?
- Sounds good.

332
00:49:06,245 --> 00:49:08,790
And have a barbeque
in the forest.

333
00:49:11,666 --> 00:49:14,462
There's a guy on the roof.

334
00:49:17,088 --> 00:49:18,089
What's that?

335
00:49:21,635 --> 00:49:24,470
- What's he doing?
- What?

336
00:49:29,183 --> 00:49:31,101
It's a dog.

337
00:49:34,188 --> 00:49:36,023
What's he doing?

338
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:40,736
- Where?
- Can't you see that guy?

339
00:49:44,030 --> 00:49:45,573
What's he doing?

340
00:49:45,615 --> 00:49:47,785
- What?
- That guy in red!

341
00:49:52,414 --> 00:49:54,874
He must be crazy
or something.

342
00:49:55,375 --> 00:49:56,458
God!

343
00:50:43,336 --> 00:50:44,504
Bitch!

344
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:51,898
You!

345
00:53:42,836 --> 00:53:48,007
Where have you been?
No mistakes, ok?

346
00:53:54,221 --> 00:53:56,098
Stamp these, please.

347
00:53:58,641 --> 00:53:59,808
<i>Lost Dog</i>

348
00:54:03,438 --> 00:54:05,189
Granny, wait!

349
00:54:09,319 --> 00:54:11,194
Just a minute!

350
00:54:12,361 --> 00:54:17,534
- What's that?
- It's my sweetie's lunch.

351
00:54:20,538 --> 00:54:22,539
Hold on a second.

352
00:54:23,456 --> 00:54:26,167
Is this your dog?

353
00:54:28,295 --> 00:54:30,671
Why is he sleeping here?

354
00:54:35,426 --> 00:54:38,304
Where are you going?

355
00:54:46,436 --> 00:54:48,104
No!

356
00:54:50,689 --> 00:54:55,903
What about $3000?

357
00:55:02,201 --> 00:55:03,576
Really?

358
00:55:04,495 --> 00:55:06,245
Your kid's at the hospital?

359
00:55:08,414 --> 00:55:13,795
How'd he swallow a battery?!

360
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:19,759
That's terrible.

361
00:55:23,095 --> 00:55:27,057
Insurance won't cover it?

362
00:55:30,102 --> 00:55:32,437
The bill must be huge.

363
00:55:36,525 --> 00:55:37,776
What is that?

364
00:55:38,735 --> 00:55:42,571
We live in an apartment.
We can't raise a dog!

365
00:55:44,115 --> 00:55:48,452
Everyone else does.
You told me yourself.

366
00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:54,331
How could you afford it?

367
00:55:54,874 --> 00:55:56,544
It's not expensive.

368
00:55:57,502 --> 00:56:03,967
- We don't have money to waste!
- I'm the one who's earning it.

369
00:56:04,050 --> 00:56:07,135
- What?
- Shut up and do these.

370
00:56:32,075 --> 00:56:34,828
Sweetie, eat this.

371
00:56:40,543 --> 00:56:45,296
Thanks for your help.
I could never do it myself.

372
00:56:45,379 --> 00:56:51,010
Good thing you called me.

373
00:56:52,470 --> 00:56:57,515
You can go back to
the office.

374
00:56:57,766 --> 00:57:01,352
- Thanks a lot.
- Yeah, go ahead.

375
00:57:11,988 --> 00:57:13,906
Damn!

376
00:59:49,175 --> 00:59:50,467
No!

377
00:59:52,846 --> 01:00:00,685
Pets aren't good for pregnant women.
They shed hair, and carry viruses...

378
01:00:01,061 --> 01:00:02,854
If you keep them clean,
it's ok.

379
01:00:03,103 --> 01:00:07,442
So you clean up after her.
Got it?

380
01:00:11,029 --> 01:00:16,743
Why don't we give her to my dad?
They have a yard and...

381
01:00:16,868 --> 01:00:19,912
That again?
I said no!

382
01:00:25,376 --> 01:00:29,879
We forgot to buy strawberry milk.

383
01:00:31,215 --> 01:00:37,220
She drinks it every night.
Go get it for me.

384
01:00:42,892 --> 01:00:44,810
You want me to go back
to the store?

385
01:00:45,270 --> 01:00:47,896
You want me to go?

386
01:00:52,734 --> 01:00:55,654
I have to go back to the store
for that mongrel?

387
01:00:56,947 --> 01:01:00,658
- It's 100 meters from here.
- Stop exaggerating.

388
01:01:01,116 --> 01:01:06,830
It's not 100 meters.
More like 50 meters.

389
01:01:09,083 --> 01:01:10,251
Stop right there.

390
01:01:12,127 --> 01:01:16,923
- You think I'm nothing?
- You want to fight?

391
01:01:19,425 --> 01:01:22,138
It's at least 100 meters.
You want to bet on it?

392
01:01:22,513 --> 01:01:25,764
- Bet on it?
- Yeah, sure!

393
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:30,352
If it's over 100 meters,
we're sending her to my dad's.

394
01:01:30,436 --> 01:01:34,858
- If it's less than 100?
- If not...

395
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:37,942
- Respect me from now on.
- What?

396
01:01:38,526 --> 01:01:40,863
I'm 2 years older than you.

397
01:01:42,156 --> 01:01:43,364
You're on!

398
01:01:47,494 --> 01:01:48,619
Watch.

399
01:01:51,747 --> 01:01:53,458
This is 1 meter.

400
01:01:54,167 --> 01:01:55,293

01:01:58,252 --> 01:01:59,421

404
01:02:05,427 --> 01:02:11,350
You gonna go all the
way back to the store?

405
01:02:11,641 --> 01:02:13,476
Just get me the milk.

406
01:02:13,601 --> 01:02:18,606
What, are you exercising?

407
01:02:46,632 --> 01:02:48,342
100 meters.

408
01:03:07,776 --> 01:03:12,531
He must be a bum or something.

409
01:03:13,697 --> 01:03:17,369
He plays with the dogs
cause he's got nothing else to do.

410
01:03:19,745 --> 01:03:22,999
Don't get yourself drunk.

411
01:03:30,339 --> 01:03:32,715
If I hadn't hit that door...

412
01:03:32,757 --> 01:03:36,387
- Thank God the door stopped you.
- Why?

413
01:03:36,970 --> 01:03:41,349
He'd have beaten you up
otherwise.

414
01:03:43,726 --> 01:03:49,064
He looked really weak
from behind.

415
01:03:50,482 --> 01:03:54,612
If we'd gotten into a fist fight,
I'd have knocked him out.

416
01:03:55,363 --> 01:03:58,322
Then you'd have made the news.

417
01:03:58,781 --> 01:04:03,953
Maintenance girl catches
murderer red-handed.

418
01:04:04,579 --> 01:04:05,871
Right?

419
01:04:05,954 --> 01:04:09,459
I'd have gotten a reward
from the mayor.

420
01:04:14,089 --> 01:04:17,924
You must be out of your mind.
Have you ever fought?

421
01:04:18,466 --> 01:04:19,718
Have I?

422
01:04:21,429 --> 01:04:25,014
First you grab a 9")!-

423
01:04:25,432 --> 01:04:32,313
Then you trip him
and get on top of him!

424
01:04:37,358 --> 01:04:40,779
And grab him by the arms.

425
01:04:47,994 --> 01:04:50,412
And break them.

426
01:04:52,207 --> 01:04:54,125
Step aside.

427
01:06:09,195 --> 01:06:14,283
Are you sleeping?

428
01:06:27,713 --> 01:06:28,713
Honey?

429
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:34,552
Sig?

430
01:06:39,764 --> 01:06:43,601
Be quiet!
You woke Soon-ja up.

431
01:06:45,185 --> 01:06:46,229
Soon-ja?

432
01:06:46,897 --> 01:06:50,566
I just named her Soon-ja.

433
01:06:55,905 --> 01:06:57,572
Soon-ja...

434
01:07:01,619 --> 01:07:03,412
Scratch my back.

435
01:07:12,296 --> 01:07:13,671
You know what?

436
01:07:15,130 --> 01:07:21,595
Some professors got arrested
for taking bribes.

437
01:07:22,553 --> 01:07:25,642
Scratch it harder.

438
01:07:27,517 --> 01:07:31,021
They used banks to wire money.

439
01:07:31,730 --> 01:07:42,739
They should have used apple boxes.
Nobody would have found out.

440
01:07:48,953 --> 01:07:57,546
I thought I just needed to study
hard to become a professor.

441
01:08:08,806 --> 01:08:12,976
What'll the dean do
with that money?

442
01:08:13,851 --> 01:08:15,396
Go back to sleep.

443
01:08:16,813 --> 01:08:22,402
If I ever become a professor,
I'll never take money.

444
01:08:22,986 --> 01:08:27,781
Turn off the light,
will you?

445
01:08:34,913 --> 01:08:40,669
Can you get arrested
for giving bribes, too?

446
01:08:41,879 --> 01:08:45,964
You don't have any money
to give them.

447
01:09:16,535 --> 01:09:17,577
Hello?

448
01:09:18,412 --> 01:09:20,456
- It's me.
- What's up?

449
01:09:22,207 --> 01:09:24,834
Did you feed Soon-ja?

450
01:09:25,125 --> 01:09:26,545
I haven't eaten myself, yet.

451
01:09:27,045 --> 01:09:32,049
What are you yelling for?
If you bother her, you're dead.

452
01:09:32,884 --> 01:09:34,510
Okay, I won't!

453
01:09:34,761 --> 01:09:38,723
Don't be such a couch potato.
Walk the dog or something!

Where's Soon-ja?

461
01:13:28,227 --> 01:13:30,145
Didn't you take her out?

462
01:13:31,563 --> 01:13:36,360
Well...

463
01:13:39,988 --> 01:13:42,032
I lost her.

464
01:13:49,330 --> 01:13:52,957
You did something with her,
didn't you?

465
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:57,795
What do you mean?

466
01:14:03,301 --> 01:14:08,432
Be honest with me.
You dumped her, didn't you?

467
01:14:09,932 --> 01:14:14,854
- She just disappeared in the park.
- Don't lie to me!

468
01:14:15,771 --> 01:14:21,360
I'm not lying!
I looked everywhere for her.

469
01:14:22,318 --> 01:14:24,528
Go find her!

470
01:14:25,613 --> 01:14:30,160
- She's disappeared!
- You fucker!

471
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:33,496
You know what she means to me?

472
01:14:42,254 --> 01:14:44,757
You bitch!

473
01:14:51,345 --> 01:14:57,894
Ki-jung became a professor.
So did Ju-hyun.

474
01:14:58,270 --> 01:14:59,812
Who do you think you are?

475
01:15:00,021 --> 01:15:04,734
I'm desperate for pennies,
and you bought that dog?

476
01:15:05,026 --> 01:15:07,486
And eat walnuts all the time?

477
01:15:08,986 --> 01:15:13,532
You idiot!

478
01:15:14,284 --> 01:15:18,662
What? What is she?

479
01:15:19,790 --> 01:15:23,542
I bought her with my
retirement pay.

480
01:15:24,169 --> 01:15:29,005
You think it's easy for pregnant
women to keep a job?

481
01:15:29,673 --> 01:15:35,094
11 years with the company,
and all I get is $13,000.

482
01:15:36,096 --> 01:15:39,390
Did I buy anything that I wanted?

483
01:15:40,016 --> 01:15:42,352
I paid $300 for her!

484
01:15:44,813 --> 01:15:48,650
And I was going to use the rest
to make you a professor.

485
01:15:49,359 --> 01:15:51,944
What was I thinking?

486
01:16:52,584 --> 01:16:54,544
Can I make some copies?

487
01:18:00,021 --> 01:18:04,234
To be honest, there were two
others before you.

488

No, I'm not related to her.

Right. We need to find him.

508
01:19:46,411 --> 01:19:48,663
The guy who threw it off
the roof.

509
01:19:49,789 --> 01:19:52,667
What a fucking asshole.

510
01:19:54,377 --> 01:19:59,758
So you almost caught him?

511
01:20:00,841 --> 01:20:04,386
I almost did.

512
01:20:04,971 --> 01:20:10,433
Did you see... his face?

513
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:13,812
No. Only from behind.

514
01:20:14,937 --> 01:20:18,107
I almost touched him
in the back.

515
01:20:20,318 --> 01:20:24,614
He's kind of tall.
About your size.

516
01:21:20,416 --> 01:21:23,043
How long have you been
doing this?

517
01:21:26,378 --> 01:21:29,424
Since last night.

518
01:21:33,511 --> 01:21:36,221
All night long?

519
01:21:39,892 --> 01:21:44,521
If I don't find Soon-ja today,
I'm dead.

520
01:21:47,691 --> 01:21:49,943
You must really love that dog.

521
01:21:57,158 --> 01:21:59,201
I'm going to the dogs.

522
01:22:04,414 --> 01:22:10,502
- Oh, it's the office.
- Go ahead.

523
01:22:13,047 --> 01:22:18,761
Sorry for leaving you.
I'll help more later.

524
01:22:28,854 --> 01:22:31,815
Cheer up.
You'll find her.

525
01:22:32,149 --> 01:22:33,441
<i>Go.</i>

526
01:23:23,322 --> 01:23:26,990
- How are you?
- Good.

527
01:23:28,493 --> 01:23:31,411
What are you doing here?

528
01:23:33,247 --> 01:23:38,043
- Can I borrow that bucket?
- What for?

529
01:23:40,712 --> 01:23:43,090
I'm washing my car.

530
01:23:43,340 --> 01:23:48,136
But you don't have a car.

531
01:23:48,303 --> 01:23:52,557
- Let me borrow it.
- I said no, didn't I?

532
01:23:52,639 --> 01:23:57,353
- It's just a bucket!
- What's wrong with you?

533
01:23:59,605 --> 01:24:05,859
- Get your hands off me!
- Give it to me!

534
01:24:11,365 --> 01:24:18,371
You messed up the bills.
So there was a big problem.

535
01:24:19,540 --> 01:24:24,669
And where do you go
when you're on duty?

536
01:24:25,003 --> 01:24:30,716
I never see you at the office
unless I page you.

537
01:24:31,426 --> 01:24:33,344
You don't even have
a mobile phone.

538
01:24:33,804 --> 01:24:37,806
You're not the only bookkeeper
in the world.

539
01:24:38,265 --> 01:24:42,978
There are thousands of girls
who want your position.

540
01:24:43,185 --> 01:24:45,398
Excuse me?

541
01:24:46,649 --> 01:24:49,525
Who's Miss. Park Hyun-nam?

542
01:24:49,984 --> 01:24:55,698
Granny told me about you
before she died.

543
01:24:55,948 --> 01:24:59,827
She asked me to give this
to you.

544
01:25:10,503 --> 01:25:14,007
<i>'You can have my dried radishes
on the roof, my dear'.</i>

545
01:28:15,218 --> 01:28:18,345
Hold it the other way around.
Let me do it.

546
01:28:21,597 --> 01:28:27,186
Hold it with its ass toward me.

547
01:28:37,780 --> 01:28:40,740
Jesus, it's hairy.

548
01:28:46,789 --> 01:28:48,623
Get ready...

549
01:29:48,429 --> 01:29:49,846
anybody!

550
01:29:56,393 --> 01:30:00,188
This isn't the first time you've
done this. Where do you live?

551
01:30:00,273 --> 01:30:01,857
Jang-mi!

552
01:30:02,858 --> 01:30:05,403
UP here!

553
01:31:05,749 --> 01:31:08,753
Is that your dog?

554
01:31:11,254 --> 01:31:12,589
No.

555
01:31:13,506 --> 01:31:16,761
Then we can eat it together.

556
01:32:10,977 --> 01:32:13,731
That's what you were
talking about.

557
01:32:13,856 --> 01:32:17,942
- Quiet!
- This is incredible!

558
01:32:20,570 --> 01:32:21,820
That's him!

559
01:32:22,237 --> 01:32:28,076
<i>He was caught by a resident
before he killed another dog.</i>

560
01:32:28,452 --> 01:32:33,790
<i>He is said to have been seen
around the complex.</i>

561
01:32:34,540 --> 01:32:39,754
<i>As you can see, he was living
here in the basement...</i>

562
01:32:39,921 --> 01:32:43,883
<i>but not even the janitors
were aware of it.</i>

563
01:32:48,762 --> 01:32:52,767
- He's a janitor for Building #4.
- Fix the antenna.

564
01:32:56,186 --> 01:32:59,898
<i>Who could possibly imagine
anybody living down there?</i>

565
01:33:00,190 --> 01:33:04,611
<i>It's an awkward situation for me.</i>

566
01:33:04,944 --> 01:33:08,864
<i>The police requested a warrant
for his arrest.</i>

567
01:33:09,031 --> 01:33:13,826
<i>He's also under investigation
for other crimes.</i>

568
01:33:16,205 --> 01:33:34,555
<i>I can have pork for lunch,
fish for dinner.</i>

569
01:33:36,014 --> 01:33:39,226
- <i>I like it in prison.</i>
- <i>When are you coming on?</i>

570
01:33:40,309 --> 01:33:44,648
<i>Because he keeps changing his story
in the interrogation...</i>

571
01:33:44,815 --> 01:33:49,611
<i>...the police arranged a mental test
for him tomorrow.</i>

572
01:33:50,569 --> 01:33:55,658
- You said you'd be on?
- I did an interview.

573
01:33:56,408 --> 01:33:58,952
- You're a liar!
- No!

574
01:33:59,077 --> 01:34:01,622
They must have edited you out.

575
01:34:04,457 --> 01:34:06,252
WhY Only me?

576
01:36:13,034 --> 01:36:22,211
<i>My husband left me,
I'm very sick, please help me...</i>

577
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:51,418
Hyun-nam?

578
01:37:55,004 --> 01:37:57,966
Let's get plastered today.

579
01:38:03,805 --> 01:38:05,306
Come on!

580
01:38:31,538 --> 01:38:34,666
Go buy some more beer!

581
01:38:35,251 --> 01:38:38,754
" YOU
" YOU

582
01:38:39,796 --> 01:38:41,508
No, you go!

583
01:39:30,802 --> 01:39:35,557
What are you doing here?
Get up!

584
01:39:48,026 --> 01:39:49,695
My savior!

585
01:39:55,074 --> 01:40:01,288
- You're drunk, too?
- Just a little bit.

586
01:40:05,418 --> 01:40:10,172
I should take all these down!

587
01:40:10,840 --> 01:40:13,717
Just go home.

588
01:40:13,800 --> 01:40:19,931
Read this.
"Will be given a big reward."

589
01:40:20,764 --> 01:40:24,436
I should reward you.

590
01:40:26,479 --> 01:40:32,443
Or take you to a fancy restaurant.

591
01:40:33,276 --> 01:40:35,320
- Really?
- Sure!

592
01:40:36,780 --> 01:40:43,203
Tomorrow I'll drop by
the office.

593
01:40:45,872 --> 01:40:48,458
I got fired.

594
01:40:58,091 --> 01:41:05,973
He said I should be a street vendor
cause I like being outside.

595
01:41:08,685 --> 01:41:12,187
I was going to quit anyway.

596
01:41:13,313 --> 01:41:18,069
I want to go hiking
in the mountains.

597
01:41:24,157 --> 01:41:25,991
Hyun-nam!

598
01:41:27,159 --> 01:41:28,162
Huh?

599
01:41:30,830 --> 01:41:33,457
I have something to confess.

600
01:41:34,459 --> 01:41:35,585
What is it?

601
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:39,797
Look at me closely.

602
01:41:41,924 --> 01:41:46,302
Look at me from behind.
Don't I look familiar?

603
01:41:50,848 --> 01:41:53,519
What?

604
01:41:56,228 --> 01:41:58,814
Look at the back of my head.

605
01:42:03,151 --> 01:42:07,656
Doesn't this remind you of
anything?

606
01:42:07,698 --> 01:42:12,203
Are you crazy?
What are you doing?

607
01:42:15,371 --> 01:42:19,041
Once we ran together like this.

608
01:42:20,126 --> 01:42:21,459
Don't you remember?

609
01:42:23,461 --> 01:42:25,381
What are you talking about?

610
01:43:25,311 --> 01:43:29,232
Yes, it was me!

611
01:43:43,454 --> 01:43:45,538
One of your shoes is missing.

612
01:45:17,207 --> 01:45:18,834
It's all set, sir.

613
01:45:36,057 --> 01:45:42,899
Today we'll look at some charts
on modern behaviorism.

614
01:45:45,400 --> 01:45:48,195
Close the curtains, please.
