1
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:08,207
It rained for months on end.

2
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:12,016
The whole of Tokyo was flooded.

3
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,050
The damage
ran to billions of yen,

4
00:02:16,051 --> 00:02:20,211
and the dead and missing
numbered in their millions.

5
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,407
The survivors

6
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:26,313
all mutated into
strange amphibian monsters,

7
00:02:26,451 --> 00:02:31,577
adapting quickly to the
suddenly changing climate.

8
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:33,581
We're all going to die!

9
00:02:33,718 --> 00:02:37,275
No, we'll mutate.

10
00:02:37,618 --> 00:02:39,917
We mustn't breed!

11
00:02:39,918 --> 00:02:42,917
Think what the children
would look like.

12
00:02:42,918 --> 00:02:44,417
No, actually,

13
00:02:44,418 --> 00:02:47,283
the horniness is
part of the mutation.

14
00:02:47,418 --> 00:02:48,679
That's why the species
is so successful

15
00:02:48,818 --> 00:02:54,479
from an evolutionary
point of view.

16
00:02:55,018 --> 00:02:58,178
<i>- Hello?
- Hiroko, where are you?</i>

17
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,318
No, we're not lost,

18
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,117
just stuck in traffic.

19
00:03:02,118 --> 00:03:04,141
<i>- Where are you?
- Right now...</i>

20
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:09,384
<i>- We've just passed Shinsencho.
- You're almost here.</i>

21
00:03:09,385 --> 00:03:11,685
<i>- OK, talk to you in a bit.
- OK.</i>

22
00:03:11,686 --> 00:03:13,684
Yeah, see you.

23
00:03:13,886 --> 00:03:16,885
Are we going the right way?

24
00:03:17,286 --> 00:03:19,945
Look at the map.

25
00:03:24,586 --> 00:03:25,552
Sorry.

26
00:03:26,486 --> 00:03:27,452
Sorry.

27
00:03:38,254 --> 00:03:42,209
We're already... there,
I think.

28
00:03:42,354 --> 00:03:44,616
<i>Really?</i>

29
00:03:44,753 --> 00:03:46,912
<i>Where? What color is your car?</i>

30
00:03:47,054 --> 00:03:50,714
It's silver.

31
00:03:50,854 --> 00:03:52,114
A Honda.

32
00:03:52,554 --> 00:03:54,816
Well,
more like gray, really.

33
00:03:56,154 --> 00:03:58,916
<i>I've got a red umbrella.</i>

34
00:03:59,854 --> 00:04:01,115
A red umbrella?

35
00:04:02,255 --> 00:04:03,515
Spin it round.

36
00:04:03,955 --> 00:04:05,512
<i>I'll try.</i>

37
00:04:05,654 --> 00:04:09,382
<i>I'm spinning it, I'm spinning it.
Can't you see me?</i>

38
00:04:09,522 --> 00:04:11,704
Now jump.

39
00:04:12,021 --> 00:04:15,681
<i>Jump? OK, here I go...</i>

40
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:19,083
Now on one leg.

41
00:04:22,122 --> 00:04:24,088
- Akemi!
- Hiroko!

42
00:04:34,022 --> 00:04:37,682
- Here, towels.
- Thanks.

43
00:04:43,489 --> 00:04:45,148
In Tokyo...

44
00:04:45,289 --> 00:04:48,551
the bigger the
company you work for...

45
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:51,248
the smaller
the flat you get.

46
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:54,454
You should work
for a smaller company.

47
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:59,047
My company's
already pretty small.

48
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:03,752
- It's a nice place.
- You think so?

49
00:05:03,891 --> 00:05:05,948
You still have Saburo, then?

50
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,656
Little Saburo!

51
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:13,045
It's raining tonight,
so your car should be OK.

52
00:05:13,191 --> 00:05:15,090
But you can't leave it.

53
00:05:15,091 --> 00:05:18,145
There's a hardware store

54
00:05:18,146 --> 00:05:21,522
just over there. Park in front...
It's been closed for a while.

55
00:05:32,158 --> 00:05:34,920
<i>AKEMI SHIMIZU</i>

56
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:39,613
Now for this week's episode
of 'Where Are They Now? '

57
00:05:39,758 --> 00:05:42,418
Akira, what are you doing now?

58
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:46,123
Well... I'm a filmmaker.

59
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:49,692
He's just made a film
that he's showing around.

60
00:05:49,825 --> 00:05:51,984
The film's about...

61
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:55,885
...is the main thing.
Please go and see it.

62
00:05:56,726 --> 00:05:57,783
This is it.

63
00:05:57,926 --> 00:06:05,984
But this is...
a porno theater.

64
00:06:07,926 --> 00:06:10,290
It's a real theater, then!

65
00:06:10,427 --> 00:06:12,689
It'll be dark and quiet.

66
00:06:13,926 --> 00:06:17,687
You shouldn't have cut
my sex scene after all!

67
00:06:18,527 --> 00:06:21,891
Are you making pornos?

68
00:06:22,593 --> 00:06:25,252
No, that was a joke.

69
00:06:25,894 --> 00:06:29,553
I had a part for Hiroko,
but she turned it down.

70
00:06:29,694 --> 00:06:32,058
What a pity. No ambition!

71
00:06:32,194 --> 00:06:35,853
Right!
That's her problem exactly.

72
00:06:35,994 --> 00:06:38,960
Why did you pass up
the chance to be a star?

73
00:06:39,294 --> 00:06:42,351
I don't like the sound
of my own voice.

74
00:06:42,494 --> 00:06:44,050
It sounds like this.

75
00:06:44,194 --> 00:06:47,456
I can't wait to see it.

76
00:06:47,594 --> 00:06:49,253
- Really?
- Yes.

77
00:06:49,394 --> 00:06:51,156
How about now?

78
00:06:51,294 --> 00:06:54,159
- I've got the DVD here.
- She might be tired.

79
00:06:54,295 --> 00:06:58,818
No, let's watch it now.
It's not too intellectual, is it?

80
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:04,519
<i>There are so many lives
in the future.</i>

81
00:07:07,962 --> 00:07:11,827
<i>Assuming we haven't
destroyed ourselves first</i>

82
00:07:12,562 --> 00:07:16,017
<i>we could live on
after the end of the solar system.</i>

83
00:07:16,163 --> 00:07:20,822
<i>In the infinity
of new souls created</i>

84
00:07:21,862 --> 00:07:26,124
<i>there's no reason that one
shouldn't be me again.</i>

85
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,586
Sorry.

86
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:52,087
I have to get up early
in the morning.

87
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:56,695
- Can you help me with this?
- This?

88
00:07:56,831 --> 00:08:00,490
I liked the bit I saw, though.

89
00:08:01,431 --> 00:08:03,363
You can change in
the bathroom.

90
00:08:04,597 --> 00:08:06,859
Hiroko, can you pull that side?

91
00:08:10,597 --> 00:08:13,897
I hope you'll be all right.
I'm sorry it's so cramped.

92
00:08:13,898 --> 00:08:15,262
It's fine.

93
00:08:15,398 --> 00:08:18,852
'A good soldier must suffer
with pride,' right?

94
00:08:19,498 --> 00:08:23,954
'Enduring the unendurable.
Suffering the... '

95
00:08:24,098 --> 00:08:26,155
Stop it, stupid!

96
00:08:28,999 --> 00:08:31,261
Seriously, though. Thanks.

97
00:08:31,398 --> 00:08:34,598
We'll start looking for
an apartment tomorrow.

98
00:08:35,199 --> 00:08:39,427
My boyfriend's staying next
Sunday. He's driving from Nagoya.

99
00:08:41,066 --> 00:08:45,021
His uncle works in advertising.

100
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,428
Shall I ask him
to come and see your film?

101
00:08:47,566 --> 00:08:51,225
You think
he'd come from Nagoya?

102
00:08:51,366 --> 00:08:53,565
Of course not!
That's my side.

103
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:55,765
His uncle lives in Tokyo.

104
00:08:55,766 --> 00:08:56,823
I'm switching it off.

105
00:08:56,967 --> 00:08:58,933
All that way, for your movie!

106
00:08:59,067 --> 00:09:02,033
Three, two, one...

107
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,030
- Good night!
- Good night.

108
00:09:04,167 --> 00:09:07,066
Don't forget
to move your car tomorrow.

109
00:09:07,067 --> 00:09:08,693
The fines are huge.

110
00:09:14,734 --> 00:09:16,597
I'm glad it's raining.

111
00:09:47,702 --> 00:09:51,862
<i>Don't forget to move your car</i>

112
00:10:03,602 --> 00:10:04,659
Look.

113
00:10:05,602 --> 00:10:07,363
We'll be OK until Friday.

114
00:10:10,003 --> 00:10:12,468
<i>CLOSED UNTIL FRIDAY
NOVEMBER 16TH</i>

115
00:10:14,203 --> 00:10:18,352
What are you doing?
It'll go up if we don't pay.

116
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:21,527
We're not kids anymore.

117
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:24,229
Cover me!
I'm going into the safe!

118
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:27,929
Copy that!

119
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:32,927
We can't make any more mistakes.
Our budget's tight as it is.

120
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:40,030
To rent an apartment...
Say the rent is 30,000...

121
00:10:40,171 --> 00:10:44,035
We'd need a deposit
of two months' rent.

122
00:10:46,071 --> 00:10:47,731
In all, we'd need...

123
00:10:48,438 --> 00:10:50,802
We would need
400,000 yen in advance.

124
00:10:57,038 --> 00:10:59,697
It's a good place
for young couples.

125
00:11:15,238 --> 00:11:17,295
Who are you? Let me out!

126
00:11:17,439 --> 00:11:20,303
It's popular with young couples.

127
00:11:20,439 --> 00:11:22,268
Do you like the view?

128
00:11:22,906 --> 00:11:25,065
Nice dead cat.

129
00:11:26,505 --> 00:11:28,971
Something smells like shit!

130
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:31,265
I can't live in a dump like that.

131
00:11:33,306 --> 00:11:36,670
There wasn't any soap left
in Akemi's place.

132
00:11:37,606 --> 00:11:40,163
Do you think it's a hotel?

133
00:11:40,907 --> 00:11:42,770
I didn't mean that.

134
00:11:42,907 --> 00:11:45,270
My bad. Let's go and
buy some soap now.

135
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:50,566
What's wrong? Are you mad?

136
00:11:51,506 --> 00:11:53,166
It's nothing.

137
00:11:53,307 --> 00:11:55,034
Come on, what is it?

138
00:11:56,374 --> 00:11:59,534
You said I have no ambition.

139
00:12:00,974 --> 00:12:02,133
What?

140
00:12:03,774 --> 00:12:08,229
Yesterday. You said
I have no ambition at all.

141
00:12:09,474 --> 00:12:11,236
I said that?

142
00:12:11,674 --> 00:12:15,129
It's not true.
I like photography and art.

143
00:12:15,275 --> 00:12:19,139
I've got a boating license,
and I read a lot too.

144
00:12:21,175 --> 00:12:24,834
But they're hobbies.
They're not the same as ambitions.

145
00:12:24,975 --> 00:12:26,339
What's the difference?

146
00:12:26,775 --> 00:12:28,400
You have to be able to define...

147
00:12:28,542 --> 00:12:32,201
who you are in the world
by what you do.

148
00:12:32,342 --> 00:12:37,400
What I like to do
defines who I am.

149
00:12:37,542 --> 00:12:39,599
Doesn't that make me
a richer person?

150
00:12:39,742 --> 00:12:43,004
You still have to be better at it
than others.

151
00:12:44,242 --> 00:12:46,105
Something's wrong.

152
00:12:49,743 --> 00:12:51,606
Something's wrong
with these buildings.

153
00:12:52,343 --> 00:12:54,901
They refuse all physical contact
with each other.

154
00:12:56,242 --> 00:13:00,198
You're always
say something clever

155
00:13:00,343 --> 00:13:02,909
to avoid really talking.

156
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:07,672
Every night, flat ghosts
slide in and out of these gaps.

157
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:09,673
And wander about the city...

158
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:15,510
They wander about the city,

159
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:18,172
scaring the people shitless.

160
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:21,768
The authorities
fill in the gaps with concrete,

161
00:13:21,911 --> 00:13:24,070
but the buildings
keep moving apart,

162
00:13:24,911 --> 00:13:27,685
letting the flat creatures
take over.

163
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,372
I could make them
out of paper.

164
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:41,135
All right, what's the matter?

165
00:13:42,178 --> 00:13:44,154
I'm listening.

166
00:13:44,378 --> 00:13:46,477
I'm ready
for a dramatic conversation.

167
00:13:46,478 --> 00:13:48,535
with flashbacks
and a big climax...

168
00:13:48,678 --> 00:13:50,940
You've stopped
listening already.

169
00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:53,544
You're the one who's 'dramatic'!

170
00:13:56,379 --> 00:13:57,937
I'm listening.

171
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:03,844
But we're talking a lot.

172
00:14:04,979 --> 00:14:07,855
That's not true!

173
00:14:23,146 --> 00:14:24,510
Maybe you're right.

174
00:14:26,547 --> 00:14:29,104
I don't think I know
what I'm doing.

175
00:14:29,847 --> 00:14:33,108
What, here?

176
00:14:33,246 --> 00:14:36,008
No, in general.

177
00:14:42,413 --> 00:14:44,713
You take things too seriously.

178
00:14:44,714 --> 00:14:47,577
Where's your sense of humor?

179
00:14:55,214 --> 00:14:57,476
There are
these two poisonous snakes.

180
00:14:59,314 --> 00:15:02,178
One says to the other.

181
00:15:03,715 --> 00:15:06,977
'We're poisonous, aren't we? '

182
00:15:07,614 --> 00:15:10,580
So the other one says

183
00:15:10,715 --> 00:15:13,772
'Of course we are.
Why do you ask? '

184
00:15:14,881 --> 00:15:18,746
And the first snake says

185
00:15:18,881 --> 00:15:22,746
'I've just bitten my tongue! '

186
00:15:36,383 --> 00:15:40,338
<i>PART-TIME JOB AVAILABLE
WRAPPING PURCHASES</i>

187
00:15:40,483 --> 00:15:41,449
A part-time job.

188
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:44,344
We could work here.

189
00:15:44,483 --> 00:15:46,449
No, they'll pay peanuts!

190
00:15:46,984 --> 00:15:50,049
It'd take two weeks
to pay off the parking fine!

191
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:52,208
Wait till you find a real job.

192
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:53,816
I want to keep busy.

193
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:57,049
Anyway, I have no ambition.

194
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:00,812
so it's a perfectjob for me.
Come on!

195
00:16:19,251 --> 00:16:21,773
I did it without thinking
and got the job.

196
00:16:21,918 --> 00:16:23,179
Only you, Akira?

197
00:16:23,318 --> 00:16:26,284
But Hiroko's dog was great.

198
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:27,974
They are stupid.

199
00:16:28,118 --> 00:16:29,482
It wasn't great.

200
00:16:29,618 --> 00:16:30,878
And it was a cat.

201
00:16:32,218 --> 00:16:35,117
You're better off
doing something else.

202
00:16:35,118 --> 00:16:36,818
I won't work there long.

203
00:16:36,819 --> 00:16:39,376
How long do you
plan to stay here?

204
00:16:41,618 --> 00:16:46,074
- We haven't really...
- We saw a nice place today.

205
00:16:46,219 --> 00:16:49,276
We have a good chance
of getting it.

206
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:54,283
Yes, a really good chance!

207
00:16:54,986 --> 00:16:56,145
Where?

208
00:17:00,086 --> 00:17:01,552
Tokyo...

209
00:17:48,855 --> 00:17:51,253
No boyfriends, no pets.

210
00:17:51,254 --> 00:17:53,514
Is there anyone
who actually checks?

211
00:18:02,922 --> 00:18:05,388
Don't wrap two together.

212
00:18:08,522 --> 00:18:09,488
Hello.

213
00:18:17,122 --> 00:18:22,578
There seem to be some residents

217
00:19:48,226 --> 00:19:52,488
So I wrap nine boxes
with just one roll of paper.

218
00:19:52,626 --> 00:19:55,325
But she says I should do eleven.

219
00:19:55,326 --> 00:19:58,383
How am I supposed to do that?
Even ten is impossible.

220
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,387
What's the matter?

221
00:20:02,027 --> 00:20:04,788
The car was stolen today.

222
00:20:04,927 --> 00:20:06,086
What?

223
00:20:07,927 --> 00:20:09,984
All our equipment was in it.

224
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:12,388
What about the screening?

225
00:20:13,927 --> 00:20:15,293
I'm screwed!

226
00:20:15,294 --> 00:20:17,293
No, you're not.

227
00:20:17,494 --> 00:20:21,654
Yesterday, I moved everything
into the apartment.

228
00:20:21,794 --> 00:20:24,259
I didn't like leaving it out there.

229
00:20:24,394 --> 00:20:27,656
Akemi was upset
so I forgot to tell you.

230
00:20:29,195 --> 00:20:30,854
Great thinking!

231
00:20:32,594 --> 00:20:34,458
The smoke machine too?

232
00:20:38,295 --> 00:20:42,352
I just told you.
There's the 15,000-yen fine

233
00:20:42,495 --> 00:20:45,795
plus a 14,000-yen towing fee.

234
00:20:46,096 --> 00:20:50,619
I don't have 29,000 yen. But
I need my things from the car.

235
00:20:51,162 --> 00:20:56,220
Can you take me to it
so I can get my stuff?

236
00:20:56,363 --> 00:20:59,420
Not until you pay the money.

237
00:20:59,563 --> 00:21:01,529
We're open until six.

238
00:21:01,663 --> 00:21:03,424
It's still my car!

239
00:21:03,563 --> 00:21:06,620
Not until you pay the money,
it's not.

240
00:21:08,563 --> 00:21:12,018
Let's just say
there's 29,000 yen in the car.

241
00:21:13,863 --> 00:21:16,762
If you just show me where it is

242
00:21:16,763 --> 00:21:19,463
I can get
the money and pay you.

243
00:21:19,464 --> 00:21:21,024
What do you say?

244
00:21:30,931 --> 00:21:33,590
What'll happen to it
if I don't pay?

245
00:22:37,367 --> 00:22:39,832
Make? Color?

246
00:22:39,966 --> 00:22:41,432
Year?

247
00:22:43,066 --> 00:22:44,225
Thank you.

248
00:22:44,367 --> 00:22:46,925
I hate him. He's a cavity!

249
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:49,630
He's got bad teeth?

250
00:22:49,767 --> 00:22:52,824
No, I mean he's a cavity himself.

251
00:22:52,967 --> 00:22:54,933
Last year
he caught pneumonia.

252
00:22:55,067 --> 00:22:58,598
Too bad,
he has a good doctor!

253
00:23:03,634 --> 00:23:04,894
All that stuff?

254
00:23:10,134 --> 00:23:12,293
Here you go!
Put it in here, please.

255
00:23:12,434 --> 00:23:14,900
Where shall I put this?

256
00:23:46,003 --> 00:23:47,162
Look!

257

<i>There are so many lives

259
00:24:19,671 --> 00:24:23,125

264
00:25:08,339 --> 00:25:11,998
Great! I've never seen smoke
used like that in a film before.

265
00:25:12,139 --> 00:25:13,696
No, Lucy.

266
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,106
It's the first time smoke's been
used that way 'outside' a film.

267
00:25:17,107 --> 00:25:20,766
Using smoke 'inside' films
is so common.

268
00:25:20,906 --> 00:25:24,565
I want to force
the audience's involvement

269
00:25:24,706 --> 00:25:26,763
by breaking through
the surface of the screen.

270
00:25:26,906 --> 00:25:29,372
The audience shouldn't feel safe.

271
00:25:30,207 --> 00:25:32,366
Pleased to meet you.

272
00:25:33,307 --> 00:25:35,364
It got to me, eh?

273
00:25:35,807 --> 00:25:39,364
You should come
to my office sometime.

274
00:25:39,507 --> 00:25:44,269
We usually do advertising
for medical products.

275
00:25:44,407 --> 00:25:47,169
But we get more
creative sometimes.

276
00:25:47,974 --> 00:25:49,735
Thanks.

277
00:25:49,874 --> 00:25:54,034
I'll think about it. I'm
considering a few options right now.

278
00:25:56,874 --> 00:25:58,840
Nice work! Pretty funny.

279
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:00,531
Really?

280
00:26:00,974 --> 00:26:02,941
Being funny is the hardest.

281
00:26:04,475 --> 00:26:06,134
I'm going for a beer.

282
00:26:07,475 --> 00:26:08,441
Excuse me.

283
00:26:09,975 --> 00:26:12,736
- I'll pass this on.
- Thank you.

284
00:26:14,475 --> 00:26:16,442
You should be in films.

285
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:19,633
Come off it! Not me.

286
00:26:21,942 --> 00:26:24,500
- Were you in the film?
- That's not me.

287
00:26:24,642 --> 00:26:30,302
I'm more in transportation.
I helped with the editing too.

288
00:26:30,442 --> 00:26:35,500
- Are you a filmmaker too?
- No, I'm just the girlfriend.

289
00:26:35,642 --> 00:26:37,608
You must be a good one.

290
00:26:37,743 --> 00:26:39,606
Relationships with artists
are tough.

291
00:26:39,743 --> 00:26:41,800
They can be demanding.

292
00:26:42,743 --> 00:26:46,506
I once went out with a painter.
He was always working

293
00:26:46,643 --> 00:26:50,200
or talking about his work.
I felt invisible.

294
00:26:50,343 --> 00:26:54,673
But when he had an opening,
with all those people.

295
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:59,674
I realized his art was more
important than my problems.

296
00:27:25,711 --> 00:27:27,734
You said
they'd be out tonight.

297
00:27:27,878 --> 00:27:30,742
Not so loud.

298
00:27:30,878 --> 00:27:35,538
I told them you were coming.
I thought they'd understand.

299
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:40,941
Apparently not! One extra
person is bad enough, but two...

300
00:27:41,078 --> 00:27:43,237
Don't say that.

301
00:27:43,379 --> 00:27:47,243
They're my friends.
I have to help them.

302
00:27:47,379 --> 00:27:50,539
They're just
taking advantage of you.

303
00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:55,044
You're not helping them.
All you're doing is indulging them.

304
00:27:55,179 --> 00:28:00,237
Your 'friend' doesn't think he has
to work because he's an 'artist'.

305
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,710
My uncle won't hire him.

306
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:05,210
He thinks he's an idiot.

307
00:28:05,747 --> 00:28:09,201
Akira's not an idiot.
He's even got a job.

308
00:28:09,346 --> 00:28:11,108
Hiroko is the problem.

309
00:28:11,246 --> 00:28:14,111
She just hangs around all day

310
00:28:14,247 --> 00:28:17,407
cutting pictures
out of my magazines.

311
00:32:38,491 --> 00:32:40,354
Cold.

312
00:32:42,691 --> 00:32:43,850
What the...

313
00:32:44,491 --> 00:32:47,457
Did you see that?

314
00:34:38,396 --> 00:34:39,760

is having a good time with it.</i>

324
00:35:20,331 --> 00:35:22,092
<i>I wonder how Akemi's doing.</i>

325
00:35:22,231 --> 00:35:25,993
And guys show up,
so scary...

326
00:35:38,631 --> 00:35:43,791
<i>I tried to fold this letter
into an elegant yacht,</i>

327
00:35:43,931 --> 00:35:47,659
<i>but I got it totally wrong.</i>

328
00:35:47,798 --> 00:35:52,663
<i>You know
how useless I am at origami.</i>

329
00:35:57,098 --> 00:35:59,462
<i>As for me.</i>

330
00:36:01,799 --> 00:36:06,061
<i>living between the buildings
with the ghosts.</i>

331
00:36:08,899 --> 00:36:10,160
<i>Just kidding!</i>

332
00:36:13,099 --> 00:36:17,464
<i>My life isn't that extraordinary.</i>

333
00:36:29,666 --> 00:36:31,723
<i>I'm fine.</i>

334
00:36:33,867 --> 00:36:37,322
<i>That's all
I wanted to tell you, really.</i>

335
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:53,895
<i>And I'm doing</i>

336
00:36:55,235 --> 00:36:56,996
<i>all the things</i>

337
00:36:58,035 --> 00:37:00,001
<i>I ever wanted to do.</i>

338
00:37:02,235 --> 00:37:03,996
<i>In fact</i>

339
00:37:04,135 --> 00:37:08,693
<i>I've never in all my life</i>

340
00:37:10,835 --> 00:37:12,198
<i>felt so useful.</i>

341
00:39:30,408 --> 00:39:32,965
That guy!

342
00:39:59,475 --> 00:40:03,532
- Who is that guy?
- He's 'The Creature from the Sewer.'

343
00:40:30,044 --> 00:40:31,010
Hey!

344
00:40:34,643 --> 00:40:36,905
Somebody help!

345
00:40:41,444 --> 00:40:43,603
He's the Creature from the Sewer.

346
00:40:43,743 --> 00:40:45,004
He's coming.

347
00:40:45,144 --> 00:40:48,076
Run!

348
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:50,874
Please call the cop!

349
00:41:00,011 --> 00:41:02,670
Call the police!

350
00:41:04,412 --> 00:41:06,673
Get him, get him!

351
00:42:13,947 --> 00:42:17,004
Tokyo is afraid.

352
00:42:17,847 --> 00:42:25,508
Who is this creature who for
the past 2 weeks has been

353
00:42:25,648 --> 00:42:29,478
terrifying citizens all over
Tokyo and then vanishing?

354
00:42:30,815 --> 00:42:35,975
The media are calling him
'The Creature from the Sewers.'

355
00:42:36,115 --> 00:42:39,275
A few shocked eyewitnesses

356
00:42:39,416 --> 00:42:44,677
have managed to film him
on their cell phones.

357
00:42:46,516 --> 00:42:48,482
Just watch, Mr. Nomoto...

358
00:42:48,616 --> 00:42:50,582
His gait

359
00:42:50,716 --> 00:42:53,876
his insane beard

360
00:42:54,015 --> 00:42:56,379
his milky eye...

361
00:43:02,183 --> 00:43:04,342
<i>I wanted to run away too</i>

362
00:43:04,482 --> 00:43:08,245
<i>but I was so scared,
I couldn't move.</i>

363
00:43:08,383 --> 00:43:14,646
<i>He came towards me...
and then he... he licked me.</i>

364
00:43:19,183 --> 00:43:22,150
<i>He was disgusting...</i>

365
00:43:24,784 --> 00:43:25,750
<i>Sorry.</i>

366
00:43:25,984 --> 00:43:28,950
<i>His eye was like this</i>

367
00:43:29,084 --> 00:43:31,948
<i>his beard went like this</i>

368
00:43:32,084 --> 00:43:39,006
<i>and he walked like this...</i>

369
00:43:39,151 --> 00:43:42,117
<i>I was so afraid...</i>

370
00:43:42,551 --> 00:43:45,813
<i>He was walking like this...</i>

371
00:43:45,951 --> 00:43:48,917
<i>And smoking like that...</i>

372
00:43:49,052 --> 00:43:54,007
The police are still searching
the sewers and underground.

373
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:08,059
There.

374
00:50:20,867 --> 00:50:23,424
There he is.

375
00:50:23,967 --> 00:50:25,228
Don't move!

376
00:50:29,667 --> 00:50:31,633
- Freeze!
- Freeze!

377

389
00:52:05,072 --> 00:52:08,936
<i>Under interrogation

390

- There!
- Here! Here!

408
00:53:24,408 --> 00:53:26,965
- Mr. Voland!
- Please say something!

409

Sir.

415
00:58:49,688 --> 00:58:54,245
<i>I asked him if he realized
that it's likely he'll be hanged.</i>

416
00:59:00,788 --> 00:59:03,152
And what did he reply?

417
00:59:09,155 --> 00:59:10,711
He said, 'No, I don't want to.'

418
00:59:11,656 --> 00:59:14,121
Did you ask him his name?

419
00:59:16,955 --> 00:59:22,820
<i>He said, 'Call me Merde.' Which sounds
very like the French word 'merde'.</i>

<i>Merde?</i>

421
00:59:24,814 --> 00:59:26,605
Shit

422
00:59:32,256 --> 00:59:36,722
<i>Following the Merde case,
the Japanese government </i>

423
00:59:36,856 --> 00:59:40,084
<i>to toughen
immigration regulations.</i>

424
00:59:40,523 --> 00:59:43,489
<i>Inside Japan,
there have been attacks</i>

<i>Mr. Merde,

<i>will be defended

428
00:59:56,424 --> 01:00:00,481
<i>one of the only
three people in the world.</i>

429
01:00:00,624 --> 01:00:04,386
<i>who can speak
the same language as Mr. Merde.</i>

430
01:00:05,024 --> 01:00:11,389
<i>Mr. Voland has already declared
that he will plead insanity</i>

431
01:00:11,524 --> 01:00:14,752
<i>and irresponsibility
at the time of the offense.</i>

432
01:00:21,591 --> 01:00:26,956
Let us move on to the motive
for this heinous act

433
01:00:27,092 --> 01:00:30,354
if such a motive can exist.

434
01:00:31,692 --> 01:00:33,157
Could you tell us

435
01:00:33,292 --> 01:00:39,350
why you took the lives
of so many innocent people?

436
01:00:50,959 --> 01:00:52,925
<i>'I don't like innocent people.'</i>

437
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:59,619
<i>'I don't like people.'</i>

438
01:01:03,259 --> 01:01:08,124
So what...
you're going to kill us all?

439
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:10,521
Wouldn't it have been simpler

440
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:16,025
since you like no one,
for you to kill yourself?

441
01:01:24,928 --> 01:01:28,291
<i>'But I love life, imbecile! '</i>

442
01:01:31,128 --> 01:01:32,094
What?

443
01:01:32,228 --> 01:01:33,887
Silence!

444
01:01:34,928 --> 01:01:36,985
Silence!

445
01:01:37,128 --> 01:01:43,993
Maitre, instruct your client
the court will not be insulted!

446
01:01:44,128 --> 01:01:48,584
At least modern terrorists
have the decency

447
01:01:48,728 --> 01:01:51,590
to blow themselves up
with their victims.

448
01:01:57,196 --> 01:01:59,559
<i>'And among all people,</i>

449

450
01:02:07,596 --> 01:02:09,562
Disgusting?

451
01:02:10,296 --> 01:02:14,661
I understand now.

452
01:02:15,196 --> 01:02:17,163
You should know that in Japan,

453
01:02:17,296 --> 01:02:20,854
we don't really like
racist foreigners.

454
01:02:20,996 --> 01:02:25,053
Besides,
nobody forced you to come

455
01:02:25,197 --> 01:02:27,322
and live in our country!

456
01:02:41,464 --> 01:02:43,623
<i>'Yes. My god did.'</i>

457
01:02:55,064 --> 01:03:01,088
<i>'My god always places me</i>

458

459
01:03:04,631 --> 01:03:07,628
<i>'lt's the cross I have to bear.'</i>

460
01:03:15,232 --> 01:03:17,993
So I ask you, Mr. Merde.

461
01:03:18,132 --> 01:03:21,996
what do you have
against the Japanese?

462
01:03:39,799 --> 01:03:41,561
<i>'They live way too long.'</i>

463
01:03:41,699 --> 01:03:44,359
<i>'And their eyes are shaped
like a woman's sex.'</i>

464
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:46,466
<i>'lt's totally disgusting.'</i>

465
01:03:58,201 --> 01:04:01,758
Silence!

466
01:04:03,201 --> 01:04:11,933
And Mr. Merde thinks
that 'he' is quite appealing?

467
01:04:27,068 --> 01:04:33,126
<i>'I don' t know.
But if I knew, I'd answer yes.'</i>

468
01:04:50,236 --> 01:04:56,998
<i>I've never looked at myself.
My god forbids mirrors.'</i>

469
01:04:58,536 --> 01:05:01,899
<i>'But my mother,
who was gorgeous</i>

470

<i>used to say
I was a pretty little boy.'</i>

471
01:05:14,503 --> 01:05:16,060
Well...

472
01:05:16,204 --> 01:05:21,262
then your mother...
sorely deceived you, Mr. Merde!

473
01:05:39,804 --> 01:05:46,930
<i>He won't talk to you anymore.
He says, 'lt's not interesting.'</i>

474
01:06:06,172 --> 01:06:09,036
<i>'My mother was a saint! '</i>

475
01:06:09,573 --> 01:06:11,334
<i>'You all...</i>

<i>'And I am your son! '</i>

478
01:06:26,339 --> 01:06:27,703
Warders!

479
01:06:29,140 --> 01:06:31,197
Make the defendant sit!

480
01:06:37,740 --> 01:06:39,501
Silence!

481
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:47,801
Defendant, do you understand
that you risk the death penalty?

482
01:07:23,708 --> 01:07:26,233
'No.'I don't want that.
'I'm against it.'

483
01:07:31,776 --> 01:07:38,232
Hang Merde! Hang Merde!

484
01:07:38,375 --> 01:07:44,638
Hang Merde! Hang Merde!

485
01:07:44,776 --> 01:07:50,936
Hang Merde! Hang Merde!

486
01:07:51,076 --> 01:07:55,736
Hang Merde! Hang Merde!

487
01:07:55,877 --> 01:08:02,207
Free Merde! Free Merde!

488
01:08:02,343 --> 01:08:09,106
Free Merde! Free Merde!

489
01:08:09,244 --> 01:08:15,801
Free Merde! Free Merde!

490
01:08:17,544 --> 01:08:24,101
<i>Today, the Pope condemned
Mr. Merde's appalling crimes.</i>

491
01:08:24,244 --> 01:08:29,700
<i>In Japan, ultra-nationalists
are violently demonstrating</i>

492
01:08:29,845 --> 01:08:31,777
<i>to demand the death penalty.</i>

493
01:08:34,611 --> 01:08:39,271
<i>But in the eyes of many
Mr. Merde has become a star.</i>

494
01:08:52,412 --> 01:08:54,878
<i>The trial's outcome
will be announced tomorrow.</i>

495
01:08:55,912 --> 01:09:04,573
<i>CONDEMNED TO DEATH!</i>

496
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:14,442
<i>THREE YEARS LATER</i>

497
01:09:48,647 --> 01:09:52,807
<i>He wants you to warn your client
he'll be hanged in an hour.</i>

498
01:09:59,748 --> 01:10:02,305
<i>He said, 'No.'</i>

499
01:10:09,049 --> 01:10:12,072
<i>Ask him what he wants
for his last meal.</i>

500
01:10:24,216 --> 01:10:26,774
<i>'Flowers... and cash.'</i>

501
01:10:35,417 --> 01:10:38,076
<i>He's asking for a last cigarette.</i>

502
01:10:45,684 --> 01:10:47,650
<i>Non smoking</i>

503
01:12:23,321 --> 01:12:25,150
What's he doing?

504
01:12:29,387 --> 01:12:30,853
He's praying.

505
01:12:54,188 --> 01:12:55,552
Execute.

506
01:13:54,425 --> 01:13:55,685
Dead.

507
01:14:05,892 --> 01:14:07,653
- It's over.
- Yes.

508
01:14:09,191 --> 01:14:10,555
It's over.

509
01:15:01,961 --> 01:15:05,415
<i>The sky has grown old.</i>

510
01:15:24,328 --> 01:15:25,885
He's gone!

511
01:15:40,229 --> 01:15:44,384
<i>Coming soon:
the adventures of Mr. Merde in NY</i>

<i>MERDE IN USA</i>

<i>Directed by Leos Carax</i>

514
01:16:37,464 --> 01:16:41,624
<i>How long will it take
before this circle disappears?</i>

515
01:16:43,865 --> 01:16:47,229
<i>10 seconds, 10 minutes,</i>

516
01:16:47,365 --> 01:16:50,525
<i>10 hours, 10 days,</i>

517
01:16:50,664 --> 01:16:53,688
<i>10 months, 10 years...</i>

518
01:16:56,632 --> 01:17:00,086
<i>I've been living in this house
for 10 years.</i>

519
01:17:02,632 --> 01:17:04,495
<i>I am a hikikomori.</i>

520
01:17:15,832 --> 01:17:20,197
<i>Usually, hikikomoris live
at the expense of their parents.</i>

521
01:17:20,333 --> 01:17:23,197
<i>but I live alone.</i>

522
01:17:24,333 --> 01:17:26,765
<i>Defecating with the door open,
I don't care.</i>

523
01:17:26,900 --> 01:17:29,162
<i>Falling asleep while defecating,</i>

524
01:17:29,299 --> 01:17:31,061
<i>I don't care.</i>

525
01:17:33,399 --> 01:17:37,661
<i>Strangely,
I don't watch television.</i>

526
01:17:38,501 --> 01:17:40,762
<i>When was the last time
I watched it?</i>

527
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:47,564
<i>However,
I feed myself every day.</i>

528
01:17:48,601 --> 01:17:50,362
<i>I don't need a table.</i>

529
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:58,333
<i>Those who are sensitive
would have noticed,</i>

530
01:17:59,168 --> 01:18:02,430
<i>but my own way of tidying up,
practiced for 10 years</i>

531
01:18:02,567 --> 01:18:05,534
<i>has now reached
the level of art.</i>

532
01:18:10,268 --> 01:18:12,427
<i>It's hard to believe,</i>

533
01:18:13,468 --> 01:18:16,730
<i>but I have read all these books.</i>

534
01:18:20,069 --> 01:18:26,831
<i>Lately, reading magazines about
climbing, fishing and travelling</i>

535
01:18:27,569 --> 01:18:29,535
<i>suddenly makes me miss home.</i>

536
01:18:33,236 --> 01:18:37,601
<i>I never get into the room
that my father used.</i>

537
01:18:39,436 --> 01:18:42,096
<i>The envelope of money
my father sends.</i>

538
01:18:42,236 --> 01:18:43,896
<i>I open it every month.</i>

539
01:18:45,036 --> 01:18:49,401
<i>The first year
money came with a letter.</i>

540
01:18:50,137 --> 01:18:51,898
<i>For the next 9 years</i>

541
01:18:53,036 --> 01:18:54,695
<i>only money.</i>

542
01:18:57,036 --> 01:18:59,195
<i>Brand new crisp banknotes.</i>

543
01:19:00,936 --> 01:19:02,493
<i>How exciting.</i>

544
01:19:04,237 --> 01:19:07,670
<i>With money and a telephone,
everything is OK</i>

545
01:19:07,804 --> 01:19:09,770
<i>as everything
can be delivered.</i>

546
01:19:10,904 --> 01:19:13,563
<i>The bell is ringing. I open the door.</i>

547
01:19:13,704 --> 01:19:15,966
<i>I take. I give.</i>

548
01:19:16,104 --> 01:19:17,365
<i>I close the door.</i>

549
01:19:19,204 --> 01:19:22,068
<i>With the delivery men.</i>

550
01:19:22,204 --> 01:19:24,864
<i>I never make eye contact.</i>

551
01:19:28,104 --> 01:19:31,264
<i>On Saturdays, I always order a pizza.</i>

552
01:19:31,705 --> 01:19:34,865
So you never look at
people's faces?

553
01:19:35,005 --> 01:19:36,062
<i>Right.</i>

554
01:19:38,571 --> 01:19:41,129
<i>I hated having contact
with people.</i>

555
01:19:47,672 --> 01:19:50,832
<i>I hated having contact
with the sunlight too.</i>

556
01:20:02,472 --> 01:20:05,632
<i>I like watching the sunlight.</i>

557
01:20:10,473 --> 01:20:11,598
<i>I can see it...</i>

558
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:13,706
<i>The movement of the sunlight.</i>

559
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:26,998
<i>Others may not</i>

560
01:20:28,740 --> 01:20:32,298
<i>but I can even see
the hour hand moving.</i>

561
01:20:39,141 --> 01:20:41,403
<i>Everything is moving.</i>

562
01:20:47,708 --> 01:20:55,472
<i>It has been 10 years
since I last moved.</i>

563
01:21:14,109 --> 01:21:16,268
<i>It has been 11 years</i>

564
01:21:17,109 --> 01:21:19,337
<i>living in the house.</i>

565
01:21:27,476 --> 01:21:29,237
<i>Strictly speaking.</i>

566
01:21:31,276 --> 01:21:32,833
<i>I am a hikikomori.</i>

567
01:21:36,776 --> 01:21:39,833
<i>I digest better.</i>

568
01:21:43,077 --> 01:21:44,838
<i>When I fall asleep
on the toilet</i>

569
01:21:44,977 --> 01:21:46,443
<i>I have sweet dreams.</i>

570
01:21:50,677 --> 01:21:52,905
<i>The reading continues.</i>

571
01:21:57,044 --> 01:21:58,703
<i>The smell of my father...</i>

572
01:22:02,444 --> 01:22:04,001
<i>Saturday is pizza day.</i>

573
01:22:07,445 --> 01:22:11,104
<i>With the delivery men,
I don't make any...</i>

574
01:22:21,045 --> 01:22:23,203
<i>The first eye contact in 11 years.</i>

575
01:24:15,916 --> 01:24:17,075
Excuse me...

576
01:25:33,653 --> 01:25:34,914
Buttons?

577
01:25:51,620 --> 01:25:54,382
C, o, m...

578
01:25:57,220 --> 01:26:00,277
Coma.

579
01:26:28,488 --> 01:26:29,454
Did you push it?

580
01:26:33,588 --> 01:26:35,451
- Yes.
- You did?

581
01:27:19,857 --> 01:27:21,322
There's a mistake.

582
01:27:24,924 --> 01:27:26,787
The eighth one from the floor.

583
01:27:29,224 --> 01:27:30,190
On the right.

584
01:27:52,425 --> 01:27:54,686
This place is really perfect.

585
01:28:16,592 --> 01:28:18,854
This smell is really awful.

586
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:41,926
<i>Because of the shock,
for 2 days,</i>

587
01:28:42,060 --> 01:28:43,821
<i>I couldn't do anything.</i>

588
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:53,518
<i>Even if I don't do anything
to start with.</i>

589
01:29:06,428 --> 01:29:07,586
<i>What's wrong with me?</i>

590
01:29:14,529 --> 01:29:15,688
<i>It's shaking.</i>

591
01:29:21,829 --> 01:29:23,590
Pizza's End?

592
01:29:48,696 --> 01:29:50,559
How dare you answer me?

593
01:29:50,696 --> 01:29:53,356
I'm notjoking, cut the crap.

594
01:29:53,496 --> 01:29:56,860
A guy like you, I'll cut off
both his hands and feet

595
01:29:56,997 --> 01:29:59,463
to make sashimi.

596
01:30:13,464 --> 01:30:14,930
Bring me some water.

597
01:30:21,664 --> 01:30:22,823
It's me.

598
01:30:25,665 --> 01:30:27,028
Don't hang up.

599
01:30:29,064 --> 01:30:31,826
The weather is dull
and I wasn't in a good mood.

600
01:30:33,064 --> 01:30:34,928
Sorry.

601
01:30:36,165 --> 01:30:38,723
I said I'm sorry, punk!

602
01:30:38,865 --> 01:30:41,524
You're really getting
on my nerves.

603
01:30:42,565 --> 01:30:45,293
You're not even good
at delivering

604
01:30:45,432 --> 01:30:48,296
and who do you think
you're talking to!

605
01:30:48,432 --> 01:30:52,989
I paid your two-weeks salary
you should be grateful.

606
01:30:53,132 --> 01:30:54,496
Are you trying to say
you are hurt?

607
01:30:54,633 --> 01:30:59,895
Well, I am hurt as much as you.
Cut the crap, punk!

608
01:31:00,033 --> 01:31:04,397
I am much more introvert than
you are! Moron!

609
01:31:07,432 --> 01:31:08,489
Excuse me...

610
01:31:09,333 --> 01:31:13,992
The girl who is working at
your place...

611
01:31:14,133 --> 01:31:17,860
Is it her day off today?

612
01:31:21,100 --> 01:31:22,361
Who?

613
01:31:24,100 --> 01:31:25,760
Pale complexion...

614
01:31:28,201 --> 01:31:31,065
Garter belt...

615
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:35,066
Buttons...

616
01:31:39,701 --> 01:31:41,564
She's my wife.

617
01:31:47,101 --> 01:31:48,260
Just kidding.

618
01:31:51,468 --> 01:31:53,128
She also quit yesterday.

619
01:31:54,568 --> 01:31:56,625
She stopped delivering?

620
01:31:57,269 --> 01:31:58,825
This is really perfect...

621
01:32:06,968 --> 01:32:08,332
The little one said...

622
01:32:10,969 --> 01:32:13,026
she'd never come out again.

623
01:32:13,969 --> 01:32:16,128
You must be all crazy.

624
01:32:20,270 --> 01:32:22,429
She had been working for
some time.

625
01:32:25,537 --> 01:32:27,298
Where does she live?

626
01:32:30,236 --> 01:32:32,395
3 Daizawa, I think.

627
01:32:33,236 --> 01:32:34,497
Don't bother about the pizza.

628
01:32:43,737 --> 01:32:45,203
<i>When a hikikomori</i>

629
01:32:46,637 --> 01:32:48,694
<i>wants to meet a hikikomori</i>

01:32:50,337 --> 01:32:51,893
<i>there is only one way.</i>

631
01:34:35,041 --> 01:34:36,200
<i>What a blinding light.</i>

632
01:34:36,542 --> 01:34:39,770
<i>It's so hot.</i>

633
01:34:39,909 --> 01:34:46,069
<i>I hate sweating.</i>

634
01:34:47,309 --> 01:34:48,774
<i>Why did I come out?</i>

635
01:34:50,409 --> 01:34:54,966
<i>Right.</i>

636
01:34:55,109 --> 01:34:57,075
<i>I'm going... Where?</i>

637
01:34:57,209 --> 01:34:59,471
<i>To the left.</i>

638
01:34:59,609 --> 01:35:03,564
<i>The subway station...</i>

639
01:35:03,709 --> 01:35:04,970
<i>No, the bus is better.</i>

640
01:35:05,109 --> 01:35:09,974
<i>3 Daizawa...</i>

641
01:35:10,476 --> 01:35:13,533
<i>Right, I don't have any money.</i>

642
01:35:13,676 --> 01:35:17,631
<i>Nobody must see me.</i>

643
01:35:17,776 --> 01:35:19,037
<i>Where do I have to go?</i>

644
01:35:20,177 --> 01:35:23,143
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

645
01:35:23,277 --> 01:35:26,437
<i>Great.</i>

646
01:35:26,577 --> 01:35:30,737
<i>This...</i>

647
01:35:30,877 --> 01:35:33,036
<i>Passing by Sangenjaya...</i>

648
01:35:33,178 --> 01:35:36,632
<i>Come on...</i>

649
01:35:36,777 --> 01:35:39,335
<i>I can ride this...</i>

650
01:35:39,477 --> 01:35:47,002
<i>I can be there in 30 minutes.</i>

651
01:35:47,144 --> 01:35:50,804
<i>Whatever, Let's go.</i>

652
01:35:50,944 --> 01:35:55,104
<i>Let's walk.</i>

653
01:35:55,244 --> 01:36:00,007
<i>Off we go.</i>

654
01:36:00,845 --> 01:36:03,811
<i>Good. Full steam ahead.</i>

655
01:37:23,549 --> 01:37:24,912
Excuse me. I would...

656
01:39:22,553 --> 01:39:26,008
<i>They all went back in.</i>

657
01:39:33,954 --> 01:39:35,112
<i>All of them.</i>

658
01:39:47,421 --> 01:39:48,579
<i>This man...</i>

659
01:39:51,121 --> 01:39:53,587
<i>I was like him 5 years ago.</i>

660
01:39:56,821 --> 01:39:59,082
<i>For her, it must
have been 10 years...</i>

661
01:39:59,621 --> 01:40:00,678
<i>15 years?</i>

662
01:40:08,122 --> 01:40:09,951
<i>This guy is a rookie.</i>

663
01:40:13,389 --> 01:40:14,548
<i>As for her...</i>

664
01:40:40,390 --> 01:40:41,753
Come out, please.

665
01:40:44,056 --> 01:40:46,318
Quick, come out.

666
01:40:57,857 --> 01:40:59,414
If you don't come out now

667
01:41:00,057 --> 01:41:01,818
you never will.

668
01:41:08,157 --> 01:41:10,419
Listen to me.

669
01:41:10,558 --> 01:41:12,421
Open the door!

670
01:41:12,558 --> 01:41:15,718
At least, tell me your name.

671
01:41:26,425 --> 01:41:28,584
It's collapsing!

672
01:41:29,225 --> 01:41:31,191
It's collapsing!

673
01:41:33,225 --> 01:41:36,885
Come out!

674
01:41:38,525 --> 01:41:41,787
Everybody, come out!

675
01:41:44,126 --> 01:41:45,989
Come out!

676
01:41:49,525 --> 01:41:51,253
What is she waiting for?

677
01:43:23,329 --> 01:43:24,795
Don't go back.

678
01:43:30,397 --> 01:43:31,953
Don't touch me!

679
01:43:34,896 --> 01:43:36,260
Don't go back in.

680
01:43:54,498 --> 01:43:55,758
I pushed it.

681
01:45:10,100 --> 01:45:11,464
It's shaking.
