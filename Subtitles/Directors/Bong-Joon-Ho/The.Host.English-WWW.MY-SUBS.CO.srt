2
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:58,780
What the heck is this?

3
00:03:58,948 --> 00:03:59,948
What?

4
00:04:02,827 --> 00:04:05,203
That's pretty gross.

5
00:04:05,747 --> 00:04:09,416
Is it a mutation?

6
00:04:10,835 --> 00:04:11,877
Is it dead?

7
00:04:12,045 --> 00:04:14,379
No, it moved a second ago.

8
00:04:14,547 --> 00:04:16,131
Yeah? Wait...

9
00:04:20,845 --> 00:04:22,637
My cup!

10
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,098
That was close.

11
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:26,933
My daughter gave me this cup.

12
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:28,810
Look, it's swimming away.

13
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:34,399
How many tails does that thing have?

14
00:04:34,567 --> 00:04:35,817
You got me.

15
00:04:35,985 --> 00:04:37,694
Makes your skin crawl.

16
00:04:39,739 --> 00:04:42,157
Mr. Yoon!

17
00:04:42,325 --> 00:04:44,659
What the hell are you doing?

18
00:04:45,328 --> 00:04:46,912
Don't do it!

19
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,081
No! No!

20
00:04:52,543 --> 00:04:54,002
Did you guys see that?

21
00:04:59,175 --> 00:05:00,509
Underneath...

22
00:05:02,345 --> 00:05:03,845
In the water.

23
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:15,273
Something dark in the water.

24
00:05:16,692 --> 00:05:18,235
You really didn't see it?

25
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:24,324
What the hell are you talking about?

26
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:28,245
Morons, to the very end.

27
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,582
Have a good life.

28
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:24,634
Welcome.

29
00:06:24,886 --> 00:06:26,219
What would you like?

30
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,431
- How much is this?
-75 cents.

31
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:33,602
Not again.

32
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:35,604
Lift your head.

33
00:06:40,902 --> 00:06:44,279
One, two, three. Here you are.

34
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,790
Daddy!

35
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:58,168
Hyun-seo?

36
00:06:58,377 --> 00:06:59,377
Hyun-seo.

37
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:00,962
Wait for me!

38
00:07:03,466 --> 00:07:05,759
Now that you're awake.

39
00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:08,178
Get up!

40
00:07:08,596 --> 00:07:11,181
Three squids for Mat number 4.
Roast them quickly.

41
00:07:12,475 --> 00:07:16,937
Gosh, how much sleep
can a body take?

42
00:07:43,506 --> 00:07:50,845
Hyun-seo!

43
00:07:51,931 --> 00:07:53,139
Here you are.

44
00:07:59,939 --> 00:08:01,147
Oh, that hurts.

45
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,234
Did your uncle do a good job?

46
00:08:04,402 --> 00:08:05,860
He came, at least.

47
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:08,280
I was worried.

48
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,698
I can't believe this.

49
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:14,411
I was the only one whose
uncle came to parents' day.

50
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:16,955
That's why I kept calling,
but you didn't answer.

51
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,540
Why didn't you answer?

52
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:20,834
You think this phone can
receive signals?

53
00:08:21,002 --> 00:08:24,254
I am too embarrassed
to use it in public. You take it.

54
00:08:24,422 --> 00:08:25,547
What's wrong with it?

55
00:08:25,715 --> 00:08:27,549
Oh, and about uncle.

56
00:08:27,717 --> 00:08:29,551
I could smell alcohol on him...

57
00:08:29,719 --> 00:08:31,720
...when he stood in the back of class.

58
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:33,388
That punk...

59
00:08:33,556 --> 00:08:35,015
...getting drunk at this hour.

60
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:36,766
Hasn't it started, Grandpa?

61
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:37,934
What?

62
00:08:38,102 --> 00:08:39,352
Today's Nam-joo's competition.

63
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,479
- Aren't we gonna watch?
- Oh, Nam-joo!

64
00:08:41,647 --> 00:08:43,106
Right.

65
00:08:58,372 --> 00:08:59,789
Why isn't it on?

66
00:09:01,417 --> 00:09:03,585
- You know what this is?
- What?

67
00:09:03,753 --> 00:09:06,004
I'm saving up
to get you a new phone.

68
00:09:07,298 --> 00:09:08,757
There's a lot, huh?

69
00:09:12,011 --> 00:09:13,553
They're all dimes!

70
00:09:13,721 --> 00:09:14,888
That'll never be enough.

71
00:09:15,848 --> 00:09:18,433
There are some quarters, too.

72
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:21,102
What's this penny doing here?

73
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,855
This is all from the change box, huh?

74
00:09:24,023 --> 00:09:25,899
- I'll tell Grandpa.
- Go ahead.

75
00:09:26,067 --> 00:09:28,193
- Tell the geezer.
- Geezer?

76
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:30,111
It's a dead body.

77
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:31,780
<i>- Mr. Yoon's body...</i>
- That's gross.

78
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:33,865
<i>...without the lower half
was discovered from Han River.</i>

79
00:09:34,033 --> 00:09:36,034
Turn to 505.
The sports channel.

80
00:09:37,328 --> 00:09:40,455
Oh, there it is!
I made that for her. Aunt!

81
00:09:40,706 --> 00:09:42,624
A bull's-eye every time!

82
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,751
- Park Nam-joo!
- Grandpa!

83
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:46,795
The old man has to run the shop,
let's watch it ourselves.

84
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:49,464
What do you mean?
We all need to support her.

85
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:50,882
Grandpa!

86
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:54,302
Let the geezer roast some squid.

87
00:09:55,304 --> 00:09:56,930
A straw.

88
00:09:58,474 --> 00:10:00,141
Let's have a cold one.

89
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:01,309
Here.

90
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,395
This is alcohol!

91
00:10:03,646 --> 00:10:05,230
You're in middle school now.

92
00:10:05,481 --> 00:10:07,982
- What? Are you really my father?
- When your daddy was in middle-

93
00:10:08,192 --> 00:10:10,735
Alright. The semifinals.

94
00:10:10,903 --> 00:10:13,154
She looks tough.

95
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:17,575
It's bitter!

96
00:10:18,077 --> 00:10:20,203
Go, Park Nam-joo!

97
00:10:20,371 --> 00:10:21,871
Who else could...

98
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:24,666
- ... take so long to take a shot?
- Oh, it started.

99
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:27,585
- Nam-joo is on. You gonna watch?
- Gold medal time!

100
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:30,463
I can't watch my daughter's matches,
I get too nervous.

101
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:32,882
- Gold medal this time!
- Gang-du.

102
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:34,175
- Yeah?
- Come outside.

103
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:37,387
- l have to watch this.
- Come on out.

104
00:10:38,806 --> 00:10:39,806
Now!

105
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:43,435
I received...

106
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:46,896
...a complaint from Mat number 4.

107
00:10:47,064 --> 00:10:49,691
Their squid had only nine legs.

108
00:10:49,859 --> 00:10:52,193
Did you eat one?

109
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:53,653
No.

110
00:10:53,821 --> 00:10:56,406
Don't deny it.

111
00:10:56,574 --> 00:10:59,284
Why touch other people's things?

112
00:10:59,452 --> 00:11:01,453
Think of it from
the customer's perspective.

113
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,204
A squid.

114
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:06,374
The torso tastes delicious,
but the legs...

115
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:09,085
...especially the longest one
has something special, right?

116
00:11:09,253 --> 00:11:12,088
From a paying customer's
perspective, it's important.

117
00:11:12,256 --> 00:11:13,882
Take this to Mat number 4.

118
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:16,259
Tell them it's on the house.

119
00:11:20,222 --> 00:11:23,892
Four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, 10...

120
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:26,227
Mat number 4.

121
00:11:26,395 --> 00:11:30,106
- I've brought your order.
- Oh, put it down there.

122
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:32,817
What are you looking at?

123
00:11:32,985 --> 00:11:34,652
There's something there.
Come on.

124
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,908
- There, under the bridge.
- See it?

125
00:11:41,911 --> 00:11:44,746
- Do you see it?
- How long has it been there?

126
00:11:44,914 --> 00:11:47,624
- It's been a while.
- l told you.

127
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,000
It's construction equipment.

128
00:11:49,168 --> 00:11:50,710
- Something they hung...?
- No.

129
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:53,796
Don't think so. It's moving.

130
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:56,090
- Yeah, it just moved.
- Did it?

131
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:00,929
Bull's-eye!

132
00:12:01,222 --> 00:12:03,264
She's amazing!

133
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:06,559
I'm not just saying that
because she's my daughter.

134
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:09,103
How could she hit
the exact center like that?

135
00:12:09,313 --> 00:12:12,524
- Right!
- l can't believe it!

136
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:15,610
Let's close the stand today.

137
00:12:21,242 --> 00:12:22,909
It's going in.

138
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:30,124
It's swimming over!

139
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:50,019
God, it's huge.

140
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,241
Did you see that?
He ate the can!

141
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:04,993
All in one gulp.

142
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,703
- ls it a dolphin?
- Yeah, must be.

143
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,121
Have some beer nuts too.

144
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:13,042
Should we throw something too?

145
00:13:16,422 --> 00:13:18,006
Pakistan?
You came from Pakistan?

146
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:19,924
It swam off.

147
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:22,468
It's gone now.

148
00:13:24,597 --> 00:13:26,097
It's an Amazonian...

149
00:13:26,265 --> 00:13:27,974
...river dolphin for sure.

150
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:34,814
This time there are 10 legs, mister.

151
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:37,442
This time there are 10 legs.
Count them yourself.

152
00:14:16,607 --> 00:14:18,608
Run away!
Everyone run away!

153
00:14:18,901 --> 00:14:20,360
Run away!

154
00:15:03,195 --> 00:15:04,862
Open up!

155
00:15:17,376 --> 00:15:18,459
Young-ho!

156
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:22,505
Young-ho!
My son must be in there.

157
00:15:23,632 --> 00:15:26,300
Someone help, please!

158
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,223
Help!

159
00:15:45,654 --> 00:15:47,155
Okay.

160
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:27,028
Faster! Let's go!

161
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:28,946
Throw it hard!

162
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:10,613
<i>This is the last shot
of the semifinals.</i>

163
00:17:10,781 --> 00:17:13,616
<i>Oh, now is not the time to
lower her bow.</i>

164
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:15,409
Shoot.

165
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:18,913
<i>Because if she goes over
the clock...</i>

166
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:21,582
- Shoot!
- Two, one...

167
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:24,585
<i>Oh, no! The clock!</i>

168
00:17:24,753 --> 00:17:27,129
You could have just let go.

169
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:29,966
<i>- Park's weakness is...
- Why can't she let go sooner?</i>

170
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:32,218
<i>...taking too long to release.</i>

171
00:17:32,386 --> 00:17:34,470
<i>And today it cost her the title.</i>

172
00:17:34,638 --> 00:17:38,641
<i>At this point, Park can only
hope for the bronze.</i>

173
00:19:54,277 --> 00:19:55,361
Hyun-seo!

174
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:57,613
Hey, come back!

175
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,824
Gang-du!

176
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:21,971
Hyun-seo!

177
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:31,272
Sir!

178
00:20:33,608 --> 00:20:35,359
You have 10 minutes to
clear the area!

179
00:20:35,527 --> 00:20:37,403
Please take care of your things
and evacuate.

180
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,493
Come on.

181
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,491
Nam-joo.

182
00:22:11,832 --> 00:22:13,207
Hyun-seo!

183
00:22:14,876 --> 00:22:17,711
It's bronze. Bronze.

184
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:20,214
Your aunt...

185
00:22:20,382 --> 00:22:23,008
...brought you a bronze medal.

186
00:22:32,811 --> 00:22:34,353
Hyun-seo...

187
00:22:34,521 --> 00:22:36,063
...it's your aunt.

188
00:22:58,086 --> 00:22:59,879
Hyun-seo...

189
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:11,015
Hyun-seo, your uncle came.

190
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:15,436
Hyun-seo...

191
00:23:15,604 --> 00:23:20,107
...thanks to you, we're all together.

192
00:23:20,275 --> 00:23:22,943
Hyun-seo!

193
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:25,446
Let go of me!

194
00:23:38,335 --> 00:23:39,627
What are you taking pictures of?

195
00:23:39,794 --> 00:23:42,546
What's so goddamn interesting?
Fuck off!

196
00:23:43,215 --> 00:23:44,840
Stop taking pictures!

197
00:23:45,008 --> 00:23:48,177
Calling the owner of a Hyundai car,
plate number 2487!

198
00:23:48,345 --> 00:23:50,095
The plate number 2487!

199
00:23:50,263 --> 00:23:52,348
Anyone?

200
00:23:54,226 --> 00:23:58,437
Hey, lady, how could
you park your car there?

201
00:24:00,649 --> 00:24:03,984
So you screwed up?
I heard everything.

202
00:24:05,153 --> 00:24:06,904
You grabbed some other girl's hand?

203
00:24:07,322 --> 00:24:08,906
You left Hyun-seo on the ground?

204
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:11,992
Your own daughter!
You call yourself a fucking father?

205
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,829
You son of a bitch!

206
00:24:16,623 --> 00:24:19,541
I thought it was Hyun-seo's hand.

207
00:24:30,345 --> 00:24:32,346
She's so pretty in that photo.

208
00:24:35,016 --> 00:24:36,517
She looks just like...

209
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,062
...her mom in that photo.

210
00:24:41,314 --> 00:24:43,190
Do you think her mom even knows...

211
00:24:43,358 --> 00:24:45,276
...that she died?

212
00:24:46,027 --> 00:24:47,444
Not a chance.

213
00:24:47,612 --> 00:24:50,239
It's been 13 years since
she popped out the baby...

214
00:24:50,407 --> 00:24:52,032
...and ran off.

215
00:24:53,493 --> 00:24:55,661
I'd run away too, damn it.

216
00:24:58,206 --> 00:24:59,623
Are you sleeping?

217
00:24:59,791 --> 00:25:02,167
- Huh?
- Nam-il.

218
00:25:02,335 --> 00:25:05,796
- You can sleep at a time like this?
- What are you doing to your brother?

219
00:25:14,806 --> 00:25:15,806
In a word...

220
00:25:16,725 --> 00:25:19,018
Her birth was an accident...

221
00:25:20,145 --> 00:25:22,062
...and so was her death.

222
00:25:25,066 --> 00:25:27,192
Old people have always said...

223
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,737
...that an animal
which kills a human...

224
00:25:29,904 --> 00:25:33,449
...should be torn limb from limb.

225
00:25:33,616 --> 00:25:36,785
That it's a human's duty to do so.

226
00:25:41,416 --> 00:25:44,084
Until I slit that beast's stomach...

227
00:25:45,045 --> 00:25:47,254
...and at least find Hyun-seo's body...

228
00:25:47,422 --> 00:25:50,424
...l'll never leave this world in peace.

229
00:25:57,432 --> 00:25:59,558
Attention, please!

230
00:25:59,726 --> 00:26:01,185
Ladies and gentlemen...

231
00:26:01,353 --> 00:26:05,356
...those of you
present at the river incident-

232
00:26:05,523 --> 00:26:08,108
There are probably a lot of you here.

233
00:26:08,276 --> 00:26:12,696
- this is an important matter
of life and death.

234
00:26:12,989 --> 00:26:14,823
Those who were at the scene...

235
00:26:14,991 --> 00:26:17,659
...or those who have come
in contact with these people...

236
00:26:17,827 --> 00:26:19,578
...raise your hands!

237
00:26:20,747 --> 00:26:23,123
This isn't something you should hide.

238
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:25,918
Raise your hands.

239
00:26:27,462 --> 00:26:29,838
If you go home, it might affect
your families.

240
00:26:30,006 --> 00:26:31,715
Raise them high!

241
00:26:36,012 --> 00:26:37,262
Hey, mister.

242
00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:40,057
What the hell is going on here?

243
00:26:40,225 --> 00:26:42,976
Fuck, shouldn't you start by
explaining what's happening?

244
00:26:43,228 --> 00:26:44,937
Yeah, explain!

245
00:26:45,105 --> 00:26:46,355
An explanation should be...

246
00:26:46,523 --> 00:26:49,983
...appearing on the TV news now.

247
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,198
To save time, we'll let the news
serve as explanation.

248
00:26:56,366 --> 00:26:57,991
Okay, the news...

249
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:00,202
...the news...

250
00:27:00,912 --> 00:27:02,287
...isn't on now.

251
00:27:03,373 --> 00:27:04,373
Shit!

252
00:27:04,541 --> 00:27:05,749
Anyway...

253
00:27:05,917 --> 00:27:07,501
...from this moment...

254
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:10,838
...you fall under our control...

255
00:27:11,005 --> 00:27:12,756
...so start moving!

256
00:27:12,924 --> 00:27:15,217
This is for your own safety.

257
00:27:15,385 --> 00:27:17,761
We have...

258
00:27:17,929 --> 00:27:19,555
...transport buses
waiting outside now.

259
00:27:19,722 --> 00:27:22,433
Okay, please
move toward the buses...

260
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,351
...in an orderly fashion.

261
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:26,395
That's right.

262
00:27:26,563 --> 00:27:28,564
Watch your children.

263
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:32,568
Oh, did anyone here touch
or come into...

264
00:27:32,735 --> 00:27:35,404
...direct contact with the creature?

265
00:27:35,572 --> 00:27:36,822
Um...

266
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:38,532
I didn't touch it.

267
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:42,244
But some of its blood got
sprayed in my face.

268
00:27:42,412 --> 00:27:44,997
Don't move! Tell him to freeze!

269
00:27:45,165 --> 00:27:47,374
Grab him! Grab that one!

270
00:27:47,542 --> 00:27:49,126
Please remain calm, people.

271
00:27:49,878 --> 00:27:50,878
What are you doing?

272
00:27:51,045 --> 00:27:54,506
- My son didn't touch anything!
- Let's go!

273
00:27:54,674 --> 00:27:56,884
Gang-du! Get out of there!

274
00:27:57,135 --> 00:27:59,261
- Dad!
- Gang-du!

275
00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:00,846
- Don't go!
- Dad!

276
00:28:01,139 --> 00:28:04,266
Gang-du, don't worry.
I'm coming with you.

277
00:28:04,517 --> 00:28:06,393
Stop there!
Hey, number 31! Stop!

278
00:28:06,561 --> 00:28:07,561
<i>This is a news flash.</i>

279
00:28:07,729 --> 00:28:12,065
<i>It now appears that the creature,
which disappeared after its attack...</i>

280
00:28:12,233 --> 00:28:13,859
<i>...on surprised park-goers today...</i>

281
00:28:14,027 --> 00:28:17,905
<i>...is far more dangerous than
previously assumed.</i>

282
00:28:18,072 --> 00:28:20,908
<i>U.S. Army Sergeant Donald White...</i>

283
00:28:21,075 --> 00:28:23,118
<i>...who fought bravely
with the creature...</i>

284
00:28:23,286 --> 00:28:25,913
<i>...and lost an arm in the process...</i>

285
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,708
<i>...is now undergoing treatment
at a U.S. Army hospital.</i>

286
00:28:29,876 --> 00:28:31,585
<i>After a thorough examination...</i>

287
00:28:31,753 --> 00:28:33,420
<i>...U.S. Army medical staff
have identified...</i>

288
00:28:33,588 --> 00:28:36,215
<i>...an unknown virus,
primarily in body parts...</i>

289
00:28:36,382 --> 00:28:39,009
<i>...that came into contact
with the creature.</i>

290
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:47,935
<i>The U.S. Army has shipped
a sample of the virus...</i>

291
00:28:48,102 --> 00:28:50,604
<i>...to the U.S. Centers
for Disease Control...</i>

292
00:28:50,772 --> 00:28:54,608
<i>...which confirmed that
the creature from the Han River...</i>

293
00:28:54,776 --> 00:28:58,654
<i>...as with the Chinese civet wildcat
and SARS...</i>

294
00:28:58,821 --> 00:29:02,533
<i>...is the host
of this deadly new virus.</i>

295
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:08,455
<i>All military units sent to pursue
and capture the creature...</i>

296
00:29:08,623 --> 00:29:11,875
<i>...have been recalled
due to the risk of infection.</i>

297
00:29:12,043 --> 00:29:16,171
<i>Only special forces trained
in biological warfare...</i>

298
00:29:16,339 --> 00:29:20,968
<i>...and disinfectant units are allowed
access to the Han River area.</i>

299
00:29:22,095 --> 00:29:23,845
Damn...

300
00:29:24,013 --> 00:29:27,558
...they made a fuss
dragging us in here.

301
00:29:27,725 --> 00:29:28,976
What is this shit?

302
00:29:30,144 --> 00:29:31,770
Where are all the guys in yellow?

303
00:29:31,938 --> 00:29:33,355
Look.

304
00:29:33,523 --> 00:29:35,065
The doctors aren't even
wearing masks.

305
00:29:36,234 --> 00:29:37,859
Hello, sir.

306
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:41,780
When might we
be allowed to go home?

307
00:29:41,948 --> 00:29:44,825
- You can't go home.
- What? We can't?

308
00:29:44,993 --> 00:29:46,660
Dad, am I dying?

309
00:29:46,828 --> 00:29:48,662
Don't say that!

310
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:51,790
Just do what the doctors tell you.

311
00:29:51,958 --> 00:29:54,376
But, Dad,
my back feels itchy and weird.

312
00:29:54,544 --> 00:29:56,253
Like something's moving.

313
00:29:56,421 --> 00:29:59,464
It's a squirmy feeling,
like something's there.

314
00:29:59,632 --> 00:30:02,593
It's because you never
take a bath, it's okay.

315
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:06,513
Attention! Numbers 25-40,
raise your hands.

316
00:30:06,681 --> 00:30:07,889
Quickly!

317
00:30:08,057 --> 00:30:09,308
This group...

318
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:11,476
...move to Room 904 now.

319
00:30:11,644 --> 00:30:14,062
- Not again!
- That's not us.

320
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:18,609
Don't tell anyone about
the blood on your face, okay?

321
00:30:19,235 --> 00:30:20,527
Mr. Park Gang-du?

322
00:30:20,695 --> 00:30:22,446
Yes?

323
00:30:22,614 --> 00:30:24,531
You need to take a lot of tests...

324
00:30:24,699 --> 00:30:26,450
...so don't eat until
tomorrow morning.

325
00:30:26,618 --> 00:30:29,828
- What? Don't eat anything?
- Don't feed him anything. No food.

326
00:31:24,092 --> 00:31:25,133
Hello?

327
00:31:25,343 --> 00:31:27,219
<i>- Hello?
- Hello?</i>

328
00:31:28,596 --> 00:31:29,888
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

329
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:35,644
<i>My battery is...
Hello?</i>

330
00:31:35,812 --> 00:31:37,312
<i>It's me, Hyun-seo!</i>

331
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:41,149
<i>Dad, can you hear me?
Please answer me!</i>

332
00:31:41,317 --> 00:31:42,401
Is this Hyun-seo?

333
00:31:42,568 --> 00:31:45,987
<i>Dad, listen to me!
I can't get out!</i>

334
00:31:46,155 --> 00:31:48,281
You're alive? Where...?

335
00:31:48,449 --> 00:31:50,951
<i>It's like a big sewer.
Really big and deep.</i>

336
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:52,119
Where?

337
00:31:52,286 --> 00:31:54,287
Hello?

338
00:31:54,831 --> 00:31:56,665
<i>I'm scared!</i>

339
00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:59,960
<i>- Come quick!
- ls it Hyun-seo?</i>

340
00:32:18,896 --> 00:32:19,980
What is it?

341
00:32:20,148 --> 00:32:22,023
Did you see that?

342
00:32:22,775 --> 00:32:25,736
- What?
- Wait a minute.

343
00:32:37,665 --> 00:32:40,083
- Sweet!
- Hey!

344
00:32:41,544 --> 00:32:43,670
Hey, don't go near the water.

345
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,090
Be careful!

346
00:32:54,432 --> 00:32:56,975
Let's go. I'm starving.

347
00:32:57,143 --> 00:32:59,269
It's okay, get back in.

348
00:34:16,347 --> 00:34:17,681
Mister.

349
00:34:17,849 --> 00:34:19,266
Mister!

350
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:24,354
Try to turn.

351
00:35:13,154 --> 00:35:14,988
<i>Your daughter, Park Hyun-seo...</i>

352
00:35:15,156 --> 00:35:16,489
<i>...a seventh grader
at Dangsan Middle School.</i>

353
00:35:18,451 --> 00:35:20,535
She's on the deceased list.

354
00:35:21,996 --> 00:35:24,998
Yes, she goes to Dangsan School...

355
00:35:25,333 --> 00:35:28,209
...she's deceased...

356
00:35:28,377 --> 00:35:30,128
...but she's not dead.

357
00:35:33,174 --> 00:35:36,051
I mean, she died, but she's still alive.

358
00:35:36,302 --> 00:35:39,095
Now you're talking in circles.

359
00:35:39,722 --> 00:35:41,723
So she's on the list.

360
00:35:41,891 --> 00:35:44,476
Wait, shut up.

361
00:35:44,644 --> 00:35:47,854
- At any rate, there was a call.
- Right.

362
00:35:48,022 --> 00:35:49,397
So shouldn't you be able to...

363
00:35:49,565 --> 00:35:52,734
- ... trace the call or something?
- Trace the call?

364
00:35:52,902 --> 00:35:56,196
That's not something we do
for just anyone.

365
00:35:56,364 --> 00:35:58,365
Are you even aware
of how complicated that is?

366
00:35:58,532 --> 00:36:00,617
"Just anyone," is that
what you said?

367
00:36:00,826 --> 00:36:02,243
Stop it!

368
00:36:02,411 --> 00:36:03,954
Step back!

369
00:36:04,121 --> 00:36:07,916
Please, officer,
let's talk like reasonable people.

370
00:36:08,084 --> 00:36:09,292
They're just kids, don't-

371
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:11,711
What are you doing?

372
00:36:12,588 --> 00:36:17,175
Your daughter never called you
in the first place, okay?

373
00:36:17,343 --> 00:36:18,843
Your son had a dream...

374
00:36:19,011 --> 00:36:21,638
...but it was so real that...

375
00:36:23,557 --> 00:36:25,976
You don't believe anything we said?

376
00:36:27,979 --> 00:36:29,896
Now you're obstructing an officer
in the line of duty.

377
00:36:30,064 --> 00:36:33,483
- Step back, Nam-joo.
- Officer, should I explain it again?

378
00:36:33,651 --> 00:36:36,194
- The way it happened was-
- l know.

379
00:36:36,362 --> 00:36:38,905
I know. You yourself saw
your daughter die.

380
00:36:39,073 --> 00:36:40,865
But she called you
in the middle of the night?

381
00:36:41,367 --> 00:36:42,492
Does that make any sense?

382
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:43,994
That's completely ridiculous.

383
00:36:44,161 --> 00:36:46,579
A servant of the people,
talking back like that?

384
00:36:46,747 --> 00:36:48,081
- Then what's your problem?
- You fucking-

385
00:36:48,249 --> 00:36:49,249
Stop!

386
00:36:54,422 --> 00:36:55,922
This is...

387
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:04,848
This is my daughter...

388
00:37:05,016 --> 00:37:07,559
...Park Hyun-seo.

389
00:37:07,727 --> 00:37:09,227
My daughter...

390
00:37:09,395 --> 00:37:10,895
I'm the creature.

391
00:37:15,609 --> 00:37:17,360
I ate her. Okay?

392
00:37:17,528 --> 00:37:19,112
And then...

393
00:37:24,618 --> 00:37:28,413
It happened like this.
This is a sewer.

394
00:37:29,331 --> 00:37:30,790
You don't understand?

395
00:37:32,168 --> 00:37:34,586
He's received
psychological treatment?

396
00:37:35,629 --> 00:37:36,963
He's not a bad man...

397
00:37:37,131 --> 00:37:38,465
...but he's in shock.

398
00:37:38,799 --> 00:37:40,467
We should understand.

399
00:37:40,634 --> 00:37:41,885
Officer!

400
00:37:43,971 --> 00:37:47,098
My daughter is alive in the sewer!
Officer?

401
00:37:47,266 --> 00:37:48,349
Cut it out!

402
00:37:48,517 --> 00:37:50,810
Your putting on a damn show
doesn't help!

403
00:37:50,978 --> 00:37:53,313
My friend's niece's husband's...

404
00:37:53,481 --> 00:37:56,274
...brother-in-law is a cop.
Maybe we should contact him?

405
00:37:56,442 --> 00:37:58,026
Right, I'm sure he'd
bend over backwards for us.

406
00:37:58,194 --> 00:38:02,238
You're a college graduate,
can't you even persuade a cop?

407
00:38:02,406 --> 00:38:04,532
What's college got to do with it?

408
00:38:05,618 --> 00:38:07,911
I put you through school selling
cup ramen, and you-

409
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:09,704
- Dad.
- Huh?

410
00:38:09,955 --> 00:38:12,499
How long's it been since
she's eaten? Down in the sewer?

411
00:38:14,502 --> 00:38:16,503
What's there to eat down there?

412
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:32,102
You over there!

413
00:38:32,269 --> 00:38:34,187
Hey, blondie, stop!

414
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:37,190
Run!

415
00:38:37,775 --> 00:38:40,193
Out of the way!

416
00:38:40,528 --> 00:38:42,445
Catch them!

417
00:38:44,448 --> 00:38:45,865
Out of the way! Quick!

418
00:38:46,033 --> 00:38:48,618
This way!

419
00:38:48,786 --> 00:38:50,203
Gang-du, hurry up!

420
00:38:50,371 --> 00:38:51,371
Which floor?

421
00:38:51,664 --> 00:38:53,748
Close the door! Quick!

422
00:38:53,916 --> 00:38:55,750
I'm coming down...

423
00:38:55,918 --> 00:38:58,711
- ... but I'm in the elevator, so...
- Where is he?

424
00:38:58,879 --> 00:38:59,879
B4 A3!

425
00:39:01,048 --> 00:39:03,550
- What did I just say?
- B4 A3!

426
00:39:04,718 --> 00:39:07,428
A3. Where is A3?

427
00:39:07,638 --> 00:39:10,598
A3. There it is!

428
00:39:11,517 --> 00:39:13,893
Stop! Catch that car.

429
00:39:15,229 --> 00:39:16,396
Stop them!

430
00:39:16,564 --> 00:39:18,731
Hurry! Open the door!

431
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,942
Hurry!

432
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:23,444
Go! Step on it!

433
00:39:24,363 --> 00:39:25,572
- Hurry up!
- Nam-joo!

434
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:27,782
Where is Nam-joo?

435
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:31,369
- Did they catch her? Oh, shit!
- Where?

436
00:39:31,537 --> 00:39:33,913
- There, there!
- Where?

437
00:39:34,081 --> 00:39:35,415
- Over there.
- That idiot!

438
00:39:35,583 --> 00:39:39,335
How could you leave
your only sister?

439
00:39:40,004 --> 00:39:41,588
- We can pick her up!
- Pick her up, then!

440
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:43,590
She's always been slow.

441
00:39:43,757 --> 00:39:46,426
- Mister, can you stop here?
- Hurry up!

442
00:39:46,594 --> 00:39:49,888
- What a dimwit! Hurry it up, will you?
- Quick! Quick!

443
00:39:50,222 --> 00:39:54,934
Hey, family!
Everyone stop. Stop the van.

444
00:39:57,354 --> 00:39:59,439
Hey, stop!

445
00:40:14,496 --> 00:40:15,914
Did we make it?

446
00:40:19,126 --> 00:40:21,753
- That does it.
- This won't do.

447
00:40:21,921 --> 00:40:25,757
The basic fee for pickup and
the items you ordered is...

448
00:40:25,925 --> 00:40:27,467
...7500 bucks.

449
00:40:27,635 --> 00:40:30,637
Including the Han River sewer map.

450
00:40:30,804 --> 00:40:32,805
Plus...

451
00:40:32,973 --> 00:40:35,266
...we brushed off a cop
in the parking lot...

452
00:40:35,434 --> 00:40:37,644
...and two police cars on the road.

453
00:40:38,479 --> 00:40:39,729
Anyway...

454
00:40:39,897 --> 00:40:42,482
...including hazard fees...

455
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:45,401
...the total is $11,400.

456
00:40:47,696 --> 00:40:49,906
Gang-du on TV!

457
00:40:50,699 --> 00:40:52,283
That's my citizen ID photo.

458
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:55,286
It's from one of those
subway photo booths?

459
00:40:55,663 --> 00:40:58,748
Hey, we should tape this and
show it to Hyun-seo. Daddy on TV.

460
00:40:58,916 --> 00:41:00,541
Jesus.

461
00:41:02,461 --> 00:41:04,671
We don't accept these.

462
00:41:04,838 --> 00:41:07,715
If you're short on cash,
we accept cards.

463
00:41:10,177 --> 00:41:12,553
We'll just take the card.

464
00:41:14,682 --> 00:41:18,768
<i>The blond one,
who made direct contact with it.</i>

465
00:41:18,936 --> 00:41:21,437
<i>He's the stupidest of all.</i>

466
00:41:21,689 --> 00:41:24,649
That bitch!
Listen to the mouth on her.

467
00:41:24,817 --> 00:41:27,819
<i>He pounced on me
and slammed me to the floor.</i>

468
00:41:27,987 --> 00:41:32,365
<i>I think he gave me arthritis.
I'll need treatment, I'm sure.</i>

469
00:41:32,533 --> 00:41:34,409
<i>- That's what he's like.
- l know who she is.</i>

470
00:41:34,576 --> 00:41:37,203
Like we can't recognize her
through that voice-disguiser?

471
00:41:38,539 --> 00:41:40,957
But they keep reporting on us.

472
00:41:41,125 --> 00:41:43,876
<i>In addition, the daughter among
the escaped family members...</i>

473
00:41:44,044 --> 00:41:46,754
<i>...is confirmed to be Park Nam-joo,
national bronze medalist in archery.</i>

474
00:41:46,922 --> 00:41:47,922
What the hell?

475
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:49,549
How come there's nothing about me?

476
00:41:49,717 --> 00:41:52,802
There's nothing special about you.

477
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:56,222
Plenty of unemployed
university grads these days.

478
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:59,684
I sacrificed my youth for
the democratization of our countrt...

479
00:41:59,852 --> 00:42:02,395
...and those fuckers
won't even give me a job.

480
00:42:03,147 --> 00:42:05,732
The passwords are all 1234?

481
00:42:05,899 --> 00:42:08,735
There's a white van outside.

482
00:42:08,902 --> 00:42:10,987
It's a disinfection truck.
You can take it.

483
00:42:14,241 --> 00:42:16,451
<i>- expressed concern that Korea is...</i>

484
00:42:16,618 --> 00:42:21,414
<i>...not adequately quarantining
the infected. The U.S. also...</i>

485
00:42:21,582 --> 00:42:23,249
Come on, let's go.

486
00:42:27,212 --> 00:42:28,921
That's the truck?

487
00:42:29,798 --> 00:42:31,215
Does it really work?

488
00:42:31,383 --> 00:42:35,386
This is what you got
after spending all your assets?

489
00:42:36,263 --> 00:42:37,930
This gun is...

490
00:42:38,098 --> 00:42:40,516
Fuck, we're not boy scouts.

491
00:42:41,393 --> 00:42:43,311
And why only two disinfectant suits?

492
00:42:43,479 --> 00:42:46,481
So two of us should just
creep around hiding?

493
00:42:46,648 --> 00:42:48,941
Dad, shouldn't this be yellow?

494
00:42:49,109 --> 00:42:50,568
If it's not yellow,
they're bound to catch us.

495
00:42:50,736 --> 00:42:53,029
Well, let's think of it
as a different team.

496
00:42:53,197 --> 00:42:55,823
Wow, this map is
the topping on the cake.

497
00:42:55,991 --> 00:42:58,326
The red circles indicate sewers?

498
00:42:58,494 --> 00:43:02,455
- You spent $500 on this?
- Really?

499
00:43:02,623 --> 00:43:04,165
But...

500
00:43:04,333 --> 00:43:07,085
...l got it from a civil servant
who knows the sewer system.

501
00:43:07,252 --> 00:43:09,545
It's photocopied
on the back of used paper.

502
00:43:09,713 --> 00:43:11,297
Hey, a guard post. Get down!

503
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:14,634
Cover up, quickly!

504
00:43:14,802 --> 00:43:16,469
Your blond hair is showing.

505
00:43:16,637 --> 00:43:18,471
Get down quickly!

506
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:21,808
Whatever, you two handle it.

507
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:45,957
What?

508
00:43:46,125 --> 00:43:49,043
If that's their attitude,
why even bother?

509
00:43:49,211 --> 00:43:51,504
Bunch of lazy bums.

510
00:43:51,672 --> 00:43:53,172
Quiet! Stop.

511
00:44:18,574 --> 00:44:19,657
Mr. Park?

512
00:44:22,202 --> 00:44:23,244
Mr. Bacteria?

513
00:44:26,248 --> 00:44:27,623
Lower your mask.

514
00:44:34,756 --> 00:44:37,175
This is definitely
a Daesung disinfectant truck.

515
00:44:38,469 --> 00:44:39,886
But are you Daesung people?

516
00:44:46,059 --> 00:44:49,312
Yes, but we're...

517
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:51,022
...a different team.

518
00:44:52,191 --> 00:44:53,566
Oh, really?

519
00:44:55,527 --> 00:44:57,320
I'm Manager Cho
from the district office.

520
00:45:00,657 --> 00:45:01,866
Don't you know who I am?

521
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:05,369
You know that
14 different companies...

522
00:45:05,537 --> 00:45:07,663
...are doing the fumigation on shifts?

523
00:45:09,666 --> 00:45:12,168
But Daesung just
barged in at the end.

524
00:45:12,336 --> 00:45:15,004
To the other companies,
it seems odd.

525
00:45:16,089 --> 00:45:18,382
So I spoke with
President Kwak yesterday.

526
00:45:23,096 --> 00:45:25,848
Not this! No!

527
00:45:26,517 --> 00:45:27,808
Let go.

528
00:45:33,982 --> 00:45:36,526
Manager Cho, this is all I have
with me right now.

529
00:45:36,693 --> 00:45:38,611
Sorry.

530
00:45:38,779 --> 00:45:41,280
I'll see you later.

531
00:45:55,295 --> 00:45:56,712
Hey, Gang-du.

532
00:46:25,826 --> 00:46:28,244
Hyun-seo. It's your dad.

533
00:46:29,413 --> 00:46:31,038
Hyun-seo!

534
00:46:59,484 --> 00:47:00,610
Park Hyun-seo!

535
00:47:02,904 --> 00:47:18,961
Hyun-seo!

536
00:47:21,798 --> 00:47:24,800
Why does he have to do that?
He's not a kid.

537
00:47:25,135 --> 00:47:30,014
Let him be.
He wants to disinfect himself.

538
00:47:31,725 --> 00:47:37,063
He's worried he'll
pass the virus on to Hyun-seo.

539
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:39,607
Virus.

540
00:47:41,401 --> 00:47:45,404
All of us are fine. Why do they
keep going on about a fucking virus?

541
00:47:45,572 --> 00:47:48,532
If the government says so,
we have to accept it.

542
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:49,909
What can we do?

543
00:47:50,994 --> 00:47:53,412
Is it the virus
that's making me so sleepy?

544
00:47:54,665 --> 00:47:59,168
- Hyun-seo!
- Look on the ground for footprints.

545
00:48:00,379 --> 00:48:06,258
Hey, did Hyun-seo describe any
special traits of the sewer?

546
00:48:06,426 --> 00:48:07,426
Special traits?

547
00:48:07,928 --> 00:48:09,970
We need some kind of hint here.

548
00:48:10,138 --> 00:48:13,140
Hyun-seo said it was a big sewer.

549
00:48:13,475 --> 00:48:15,476
Look how big this is.

550
00:48:15,644 --> 00:48:18,604
Yes, it seems we'll find something.

551
00:48:18,772 --> 00:48:19,772
Yeah, sure!

552
00:48:20,524 --> 00:48:23,818
Wandering blindly
through the sewers.

553
00:48:23,985 --> 00:48:26,612
- We need to think of a better way.
- Stop complaining!

554
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:29,198
Put your time into
searching another sewer instead.

555
00:48:29,366 --> 00:48:34,078
Hey, tortoise, just try to keep up.
Slow-ass bronze medalist.

556
00:48:34,246 --> 00:48:35,538
- You wanna die?
- Wait!

557
00:48:39,084 --> 00:48:40,376
Hyun-seo!

558
00:48:40,544 --> 00:48:42,211
- Hyun-seo!
- Turn it off!

559
00:48:46,091 --> 00:48:48,676
Something moved there.

560
00:49:08,488 --> 00:49:09,947
It's this way!

561
00:49:14,661 --> 00:49:15,661
Get down!

562
00:49:21,042 --> 00:49:22,042
What is this?

563
00:49:24,921 --> 00:49:26,255
It's just water.

564
00:49:27,632 --> 00:49:28,966
Goddamn it.

565
00:49:30,886 --> 00:49:32,219
How typical of you.

566
00:49:33,138 --> 00:49:34,847
Sorry, Dad.

567
00:49:37,934 --> 00:49:39,435
Did you pee?

568
00:49:39,770 --> 00:49:43,147
Because of the bangs, a little.

569
00:49:46,777 --> 00:49:49,278
Why are they
going around shooting?

570
00:49:55,952 --> 00:50:00,289
This cave really does lead
to the Han River.

571
00:50:00,749 --> 00:50:02,958
It's not a cave, it's a sewer.

572
00:50:04,044 --> 00:50:07,505
They're all connected like this.

573
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:34,406
Gosh, it's hard to make a living.

574
00:50:35,033 --> 00:50:37,034
Do we really have to go?

575
00:50:38,537 --> 00:50:40,371
So you're not hungry?

576
00:50:40,539 --> 00:50:42,540
No, I'm hungry.

577
00:50:43,625 --> 00:50:45,334
If we do this once...

578
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:48,629
...we'll eat well for a whole month.

579
00:50:49,631 --> 00:50:51,465
- Don't you know that?
- l do.

580
00:51:04,855 --> 00:51:06,856
There's money too.

581
00:51:07,566 --> 00:51:09,066
Don't touch it.

582
00:51:09,442 --> 00:51:11,443
Why not? I'm taking it.

583
00:51:11,778 --> 00:51:14,780
If we take that too, it's theft.

584
00:51:15,407 --> 00:51:16,740
Put it back now, okay?

585
00:51:18,910 --> 00:51:21,912
We're stealing
from this place anyway.

586
00:51:24,749 --> 00:51:26,250
Se-joo...

587
00:51:26,459 --> 00:51:28,794
...this is not theft.

588
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:33,549
We're now doing <i>seo-ri.</i>

589
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:37,344
Like melon <i>seo-ri</i> at a farm.

590
00:51:41,349 --> 00:51:44,852
Hey, do you even know
what <i>seo-ri</i> means?

591
00:51:45,478 --> 00:51:46,478
<i>Seo-ri.</i>

592
00:51:48,648 --> 00:51:51,567
No? The generation gap
is pretty big.

593
00:51:51,735 --> 00:51:55,738
It's an old borrowing game kids play.
So <i>seo-ri</i> is a right of the hungry.

594
00:52:11,463 --> 00:52:12,463
Run!

595
00:55:37,168 --> 00:55:39,002
Hey.

596
00:55:45,593 --> 00:55:46,593
Hey...

597
00:55:48,012 --> 00:55:49,513
What should I do?

598
00:55:52,433 --> 00:55:53,767
Are you okay?

599
00:56:58,249 --> 00:56:59,291
Look at that.

600
00:56:59,876 --> 00:57:02,419
Isn't that amazing?
In this situation?

601
00:57:02,712 --> 00:57:04,630
Wake him up, there's no time.

602
00:57:04,797 --> 00:57:08,800
Let him sleep a minute.
He needs to sleep every so often.

603
00:57:08,968 --> 00:57:11,762
Should we leave him here?
He's no help anyway.

604
00:57:12,138 --> 00:57:13,847
Kids, wait a minute.

605
00:57:17,310 --> 00:57:18,602
Sit down.

606
00:57:26,236 --> 00:57:27,736
In your view...

607
00:57:27,904 --> 00:57:29,529
...is Gang-du...

608
00:57:29,697 --> 00:57:31,823
...really so pathetic?

609
00:57:33,493 --> 00:57:35,035
- Yup.
- Yes.

610
00:57:37,497 --> 00:57:39,665
You wouldn't know it...

611
00:57:40,166 --> 00:57:43,335
...but he was a really smart kid.

612
00:57:44,462 --> 00:57:46,964
For example, when he was 2...

613
00:57:47,173 --> 00:57:50,008
...he'd sit
in front of the village store...

614
00:57:50,843 --> 00:57:54,012
...and everyone walking by
would ask him directions.

615
00:57:54,472 --> 00:57:57,808
That's how smart he looked.

616
00:58:05,566 --> 00:58:09,486
As you know,
when he was young...

617
00:58:10,613 --> 00:58:12,447
...l was out of my mind...

618
00:58:12,615 --> 00:58:15,284
...hardly ever coming home,
staying out all night.

619
00:58:15,827 --> 00:58:19,830
And this poor boy with no mother...

620
00:58:21,791 --> 00:58:24,209
...he must have been so hungry.

621
00:58:24,377 --> 00:58:27,254
Going around,
doing <i>seo-ri</i> all the time.

622
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:30,674
Raising himself on organic farms.

623
00:58:31,134 --> 00:58:34,636
Whenever he got caught,
he'd get beaten up.

624
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:37,681
In this way...

625
00:58:38,641 --> 00:58:40,475
...he lacked protein...

626
00:58:41,602 --> 00:58:44,563
...when he needed it most.

627
00:58:45,106 --> 00:58:47,107
So that's why, every now and then...

628
00:58:47,317 --> 00:58:50,652
...he dozes off like a sick rooster.

629
00:58:54,324 --> 00:58:55,490
I think something up there...

630
00:58:58,745 --> 00:59:01,747
...must have gone wrong too.

631
00:59:14,093 --> 00:59:17,929
Have any of you heard it?

632
00:59:19,766 --> 00:59:24,353
The heartbreak of a parent
who's lost a child.

633
00:59:26,939 --> 00:59:29,316
When a parent's heart breaks...

634
00:59:30,068 --> 00:59:33,070
...the sound can travel for miles.

635
00:59:34,113 --> 00:59:37,949
So I really need to say this to you.

636
00:59:38,576 --> 00:59:42,913
Be as nice to Gang-du as you can.

637
00:59:43,581 --> 00:59:46,583
Don't scold him, okay?

638
00:59:47,502 --> 00:59:52,464
Like last time, "Why'd you
grab another girl's hand, moron?"

639
00:59:52,632 --> 00:59:56,635
You should never say
things like that to him, okay?

640
01:00:01,974 --> 01:00:02,974
You know?

641
01:00:03,309 --> 01:00:07,646
I spend most of the day
in the small food stand with him.

642
01:00:07,814 --> 01:00:10,399
So whenever I hear him fart...

643
01:00:10,566 --> 01:00:15,404
...l can tell right away if he's in
B- minus or A-plus condition.

644
01:00:16,322 --> 01:00:18,323
What do you two know?

645
01:00:19,742 --> 01:00:21,410
But even still...

646
01:00:22,328 --> 01:00:24,329
...our Hyun-seo...

647
01:00:24,497 --> 01:00:25,831
Hyun-seo?

648
01:00:26,916 --> 01:00:28,542
Hey, you're-

649
01:00:28,876 --> 01:00:30,377
It's watching.

650
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:32,003
Huh?

651
01:00:34,424 --> 01:00:35,757
It's watching us.

652
01:01:09,167 --> 01:01:10,167
Fire.

653
01:01:14,672 --> 01:01:15,922
Fuck!

654
01:01:20,386 --> 01:01:21,386
My head!

655
01:02:04,013 --> 01:02:05,055
Do you see it?

656
01:02:15,566 --> 01:02:17,901
What's going on?

657
01:02:18,736 --> 01:02:20,237
Hyun- Hyun-seo!

658
01:02:20,404 --> 01:02:21,404
Hyun-seo!

659
01:02:21,572 --> 01:02:22,572
Quiet.

660
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:24,407
It's moving.

661
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:29,246
- What you doing? Make sure it's dead.
- No, wait!

662
01:02:29,997 --> 01:02:31,998
Goddamn it!
That thing's still alive?

663
01:02:32,166 --> 01:02:34,334
Don't get too close!

664
01:02:34,627 --> 01:02:35,961
Don't!

665
01:02:43,678 --> 01:02:47,973
Shoot it in the legs!

666
01:02:48,933 --> 01:02:50,100
Just shoot!

667
01:02:58,234 --> 01:02:59,234
There it is!

668
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:02,988
Shoot it in the tail!

669
01:03:07,994 --> 01:03:09,536
- The bullets...
- No bullets!

670
01:03:10,538 --> 01:03:12,205
Hey!

671
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:15,083
My ears! Stop it!
Are you trying to kill us?

672
01:03:30,474 --> 01:03:32,142
Let's go to the truck.

673
01:03:34,395 --> 01:03:36,563
Bring it on!
You all go on!

674
01:03:37,148 --> 01:03:40,358
I'm gonna finish that thing off!

675
01:03:40,526 --> 01:03:41,860
- Just run!
- Anyone got any bullets?

676
01:03:42,028 --> 01:03:43,111
- I've got one left.
- Good.

677
01:03:43,279 --> 01:03:45,405
Give it to me,
and get to the truck.

678
01:03:45,573 --> 01:03:46,573
Dad! Come on!

679
01:03:46,741 --> 01:03:48,700
Don't worry about me,
go to the truck!

680
01:03:48,868 --> 01:03:50,285
Dad! Just come here!

681
01:03:59,712 --> 01:04:02,005
I'll take you down
with one shot this time.

682
01:04:02,173 --> 01:04:03,548
Get up here!

683
01:04:03,716 --> 01:04:05,425
What's that?

684
01:04:05,593 --> 01:04:08,261
Nam-joo!
What are you doing?

685
01:04:08,429 --> 01:04:09,763
- Nam-joo!
- When did she get there?

686
01:04:09,972 --> 01:04:12,557
- Go back!
- Nam-joo!

687
01:04:13,351 --> 01:04:14,351
Oh, no.

688
01:04:14,518 --> 01:04:17,354
Hey!
Somebody come get Nam-joo!

689
01:04:18,522 --> 01:04:20,357
Stop playing around!

690
01:04:20,524 --> 01:04:21,983
Hurry back! Quick!

691
01:04:45,299 --> 01:04:47,676
No! Dad! No!

692
01:04:47,843 --> 01:04:50,345
Fuck! No!

693
01:04:51,097 --> 01:04:52,430
No!

694
01:05:24,296 --> 01:05:25,338
Dad.

695
01:05:26,924 --> 01:05:29,175
Dad, wake up!

696
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:32,762
- Dad, the soldiers are coming.
- Dad!

697
01:05:32,930 --> 01:05:35,724
- You two, get out of here! Quick!
- Fuck!

698
01:05:35,891 --> 01:05:38,435
We should never have...

699
01:05:38,602 --> 01:05:40,270
Dad, what about Hyun-seo?

700
01:05:40,438 --> 01:05:42,981
Hyun-seo. We can't get caught.
Hurry, hurry.

701
01:05:43,149 --> 01:05:45,734
- Run! Run!
- Dad!

702
01:05:47,445 --> 01:05:51,322
What about Hyun-seo? Dad...

703
01:06:11,218 --> 01:06:17,223
Dad.

704
01:06:22,146 --> 01:06:23,980
Freeze.

705
01:06:24,148 --> 01:06:27,567
Infected family located.
One captured, one dead.

706
01:06:27,735 --> 01:06:29,819
Quickly!

707
01:06:30,279 --> 01:06:32,113
Let's begin.
Hurry!

708
01:06:32,281 --> 01:06:33,364
Cover him!

709
01:06:35,701 --> 01:06:38,536
We have tragic news.

710
01:06:38,704 --> 01:06:41,414
Sergeant Donald
of the 8th U.S. Army...

711
01:06:41,582 --> 01:06:44,918
...who through
his act of courage revealed...

712
01:06:45,085 --> 01:06:48,213
...to the world the existence of
the virus, died today at 4:20 p.m.

713
01:06:48,380 --> 01:06:50,673
As condolences flood in
from all over the world...

714
01:06:50,841 --> 01:06:53,384
...8th U.S. Army
Commander Greenfield...

715
01:06:53,552 --> 01:06:55,553
...held a rare press conference...

716
01:06:55,721 --> 01:06:57,305
...to express his condolences.

717
01:06:58,682 --> 01:07:00,183
Meanwhile the U.S. and WHO...

718
01:07:00,351 --> 01:07:03,144
...citing the failure
of the Korean government...

719
01:07:03,312 --> 01:07:07,106
...to secure the remaining two
infected family members...

720
01:07:07,274 --> 01:07:10,235
...or to capture the creature in
question, have announced...

721
01:07:12,404 --> 01:07:13,488
...a policy of direct intervention.

722
01:07:13,656 --> 01:07:17,742
Yes, in this context,
the unprecedented use of...

723
01:07:17,910 --> 01:07:20,411
..."Agent Yellow," is that correct?

724
01:07:20,579 --> 01:07:21,913
Yes, that's correct.

725
01:07:22,081 --> 01:07:25,583
Agent Yellow, which has been
chosen for use here in Korea...

726
01:07:25,751 --> 01:07:29,379
...is a state-of-the-art chemical
and deployment system...

727
01:07:29,547 --> 01:07:32,966
...recently developed
by the U.S. to fight virus outbreaks...

728
01:07:33,133 --> 01:07:35,009
...or biological terror.

729
01:07:35,177 --> 01:07:39,180
This extremely powerful and
effective system, once activated...

730
01:07:39,348 --> 01:07:41,516
...completely annihilates
all biological agents...

731
01:07:41,684 --> 01:07:45,436
...within a radius of
dozens of kilometers.

732
01:08:13,674 --> 01:08:17,844
<i>Indeed, we are trying to provide
Mr. Park the most pleasant...</i>

733
01:08:18,012 --> 01:08:19,846
<i>...environment
that a patient could want.</i>

734
01:08:20,014 --> 01:08:25,143
<i>We are doing our best
to accommodate Mr. Park Gang-du-</i>

735
01:09:52,439 --> 01:09:53,439
Hey!

736
01:09:53,732 --> 01:09:55,900
- When did you get here?
- Just a minute ago.

737
01:09:57,194 --> 01:09:58,861
Nobody followed you, right?

738
01:09:59,071 --> 01:10:01,239
It's okay, I checked carefully.

739
01:10:01,407 --> 01:10:04,409
And Nam-joo?
Where's Nam-joo?

740
01:10:04,576 --> 01:10:05,576
Nam-joo? Why?

741
01:10:05,744 --> 01:10:07,912
You travel separately, you two?

742
01:10:28,183 --> 01:10:31,686
So if you just type
into the office's computer...

743
01:10:31,854 --> 01:10:33,688
...it shows up? Really?

744
01:10:33,939 --> 01:10:36,274
Hyun-seo called late at night, right?

745
01:10:36,442 --> 01:10:38,943
Then the transmitter will
be listed in the call records.

746
01:10:39,111 --> 01:10:42,780
That means she's within
200 meters of a transmitter.

747
01:10:43,949 --> 01:10:45,366
That's simple.

748
01:10:47,077 --> 01:10:48,828
It's that easy to get her location?

749
01:10:48,996 --> 01:10:51,998
That's right, you should have
come to me earlier.

750
01:10:52,458 --> 01:10:54,959
Is all of your family
so dumb all the time?

751
01:10:55,836 --> 01:10:59,505
Right, all those sewers, fuck.

752
01:11:00,299 --> 01:11:02,967
It's okay, finding her
is just a matter of time.

753
01:11:04,595 --> 01:11:05,887
All thanks to you.

754
01:11:07,222 --> 01:11:10,308
You were always busy protesting...

755
01:11:10,476 --> 01:11:12,226
...when did you ever study?

756
01:11:12,394 --> 01:11:15,063
It must be really hard
getting work at a telecom firm.

757
01:11:16,190 --> 01:11:18,024
Still, I'm just a salaryman.

758
01:11:19,234 --> 01:11:22,070
But you must make 60,
70 grand a year?

759
01:11:23,781 --> 01:11:25,448
My credit card debt is 60, 70 grand.

760
01:11:25,783 --> 01:11:27,950
- Look.
- Wait...

761
01:11:28,994 --> 01:11:32,080
The time, the number...

762
01:11:32,372 --> 01:11:33,998
Here. This is it!

763
01:11:34,166 --> 01:11:35,333
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

764
01:11:35,501 --> 01:11:36,667
Just a minute.

765
01:11:40,964 --> 01:11:42,715
This is definitely her call.

766
01:11:43,008 --> 01:11:44,342
Type this in.

767
01:11:44,551 --> 01:11:47,011
ATR1020.

768
01:11:48,847 --> 01:11:50,681
- It doesn't work.
- Really?

769
01:11:52,684 --> 01:11:55,812
The password...
It must be in the manager's room.

770
01:11:57,356 --> 01:11:58,356
Here.

771
01:11:59,191 --> 01:12:00,483
Hey, Nam-il...

772
01:12:00,651 --> 01:12:02,610
...where is Nam-joo anyway?

773
01:12:02,778 --> 01:12:04,320
Why do you keep asking?

774
01:12:04,488 --> 01:12:06,322
She's your sister. Aren't you worried?

775
01:12:12,496 --> 01:12:14,497
When we left the Han River...

776
01:12:16,291 --> 01:12:18,626
...we just separated in the sewer.

777
01:12:20,796 --> 01:12:22,296
I'm sure she's fine.

778
01:12:23,090 --> 01:12:25,258
I see.

779
01:12:36,854 --> 01:12:38,312
Now what?

780
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:41,816
It'll be hard to get Nam-joo.
Seems like he really doesn't know.

781
01:12:43,902 --> 01:12:47,405
Then let's take care of Nam-il first.

782
01:12:48,448 --> 01:12:51,033
He's a real escape artist, though.

783
01:12:51,201 --> 01:12:52,827
You should be careful.

784
01:12:55,247 --> 01:12:56,247
Hey!

785
01:13:05,591 --> 01:13:09,260
By the way, how much is the tax
on the reward money?

786
01:13:09,428 --> 01:13:13,890
Well, there's an exemption,
and there's no tax on extra earnings.

787
01:13:14,516 --> 01:13:16,142
I see.

788
01:13:20,731 --> 01:13:22,273
Huh? This...

789
01:13:23,275 --> 01:13:25,401
Hyun-seo!

790
01:13:25,652 --> 01:13:26,652
Hey, it worked!

791
01:13:26,820 --> 01:13:29,614
Mr. Park Nam-il,
are you feeling sick?

792
01:13:29,781 --> 01:13:32,491
Greetings, Mr. Park!
Just stay right there.

793
01:13:38,498 --> 01:13:41,500
What are you doing?
Just come with us.

794
01:13:42,127 --> 01:13:43,961
You should go to the hospital.

795
01:13:45,756 --> 01:13:46,756
Fuck off.

796
01:13:49,051 --> 01:13:50,885
- What the-
- Where is he?

797
01:13:56,892 --> 01:13:59,227
You rat! Stop right there!

798
01:13:59,436 --> 01:14:01,354
Hey! Come on!

799
01:14:07,319 --> 01:14:09,320
Open this door!

800
01:14:09,655 --> 01:14:11,656
Hey!
Get him!

801
01:14:37,808 --> 01:14:38,808
Shit!

802
01:14:54,908 --> 01:14:56,367
- Where is he?
- Over there!

803
01:14:56,535 --> 01:14:58,828
I don't see anything!

804
01:14:59,746 --> 01:15:01,914
Hey, Yong-bae, did you see him?

805
01:15:05,711 --> 01:15:07,211
Let's search the area.

806
01:16:01,558 --> 01:16:03,059
<i>There is no signal...</i>

807
01:16:03,226 --> 01:16:07,563
<i>...please leave your message
after the beep.</i>

808
01:16:08,774 --> 01:16:10,107
Nam-joo...

809
01:17:11,503 --> 01:17:13,003
Hyun-seo!

810
01:17:35,986 --> 01:17:38,863
<i>One new text message received.</i>

811
01:18:37,422 --> 01:18:38,797
It's me, Nam-joo.

812
01:18:39,216 --> 01:18:40,382
Nam-joo!

813
01:18:41,259 --> 01:18:43,761
I found it! A huge sewer.

814
01:18:43,929 --> 01:18:46,388
Right under the
north side of Wonhyo Bridge!

815
01:18:46,556 --> 01:18:48,891
I can't reach Nam-il!
North side of Wonhyo Bridge?

816
01:19:10,330 --> 01:19:14,333
<i>Hello? Nam-joo! Nam-joo!</i>

817
01:19:21,258 --> 01:19:23,592
<i>Are you okay?
Hello?</i>

818
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:25,594
<i>Nam-joo- Park Nam-joo...</i>

819
01:19:25,762 --> 01:19:26,762
<i>Nam-joo!</i>

820
01:19:26,930 --> 01:19:28,931
Nam-joo-

821
01:19:29,099 --> 01:19:31,016
Please calm down.

822
01:19:32,936 --> 01:19:35,479
Wonhyo Bridge. Is it-? Where is...?

823
01:19:35,647 --> 01:19:37,565
It's near Yeouido, right?

824
01:19:37,732 --> 01:19:41,068
- Yes, yes.
- l need to go out for a minute.

825
01:19:41,361 --> 01:19:44,405
Sit down. You need to get a shot.

826
01:19:45,365 --> 01:19:48,200
What kind of shot
did you say this was?

827
01:19:48,368 --> 01:19:49,827
An anesthetic.

828
01:19:49,995 --> 01:19:54,999
Oh, right, right.
I'll get the shot before going.

829
01:19:55,250 --> 01:19:57,585
Okay, let your arm relax.

830
01:19:57,752 --> 01:20:00,170
But Wonhyo Bridge.
Hyun-seo is still...

831
01:20:01,923 --> 01:20:02,923
Grab him!

832
01:20:03,133 --> 01:20:05,926
Hyun-seo!

833
01:20:06,177 --> 01:20:07,511
Hyun-seo.

834
01:20:09,514 --> 01:20:11,015
Let me go!

835
01:20:11,182 --> 01:20:14,518
She's near the
north side of Wonhyo Bridge.

836
01:20:14,686 --> 01:20:17,688
Is Wonhyo Bridge named after
the monk Wonhyo?

837
01:20:17,856 --> 01:20:22,192
He wasn't a monk. He was a priest.

838
01:20:24,529 --> 01:20:26,864
Did you really inject
the proper amount?

839
01:20:27,032 --> 01:20:28,198
- Yes.
- For sure?

840
01:20:28,491 --> 01:20:29,992
We did for sure.

841
01:20:31,369 --> 01:20:33,495
And it's been an hour.

842
01:20:37,584 --> 01:20:39,251
- And he's still like that?
- Yes.

843
01:20:39,711 --> 01:20:41,378
Then what should we do?

844
01:20:42,505 --> 01:20:44,673
We should start
the tissue sampling now.

845
01:20:52,015 --> 01:20:54,058
Why's he like that?

846
01:20:54,726 --> 01:20:57,811
If we've anaesthetised him,
he should be sleeping.

847
01:20:58,313 --> 01:21:00,147
Why's he causing such a scene?

848
01:21:01,441 --> 01:21:03,108
Why?

849
01:21:04,027 --> 01:21:05,527
Excuse me, sir.

850
01:22:23,106 --> 01:22:24,440
Because nobody...

851
01:22:45,170 --> 01:22:48,505
Please don't cut me off.
My words are words too.

852
01:22:48,673 --> 01:22:52,176
Why don't you listen to my words?

853
01:23:16,576 --> 01:23:17,826
Let me go.

854
01:24:29,649 --> 01:24:30,983
You mean there's no virus?

855
01:24:31,526 --> 01:24:33,610
Right? There's no virus.

856
01:24:36,364 --> 01:24:39,283
You're talking about
a virus that doesn't exist.

857
01:24:39,450 --> 01:24:42,119
Mister, they said there's no virus.

858
01:24:42,287 --> 01:24:44,955
So you should let me go now.

859
01:24:45,790 --> 01:24:50,627
My daughter Hyun-seo
is under Wonhyo Bridge.

860
01:24:52,463 --> 01:24:55,465
I need to go quickly.
Please let me go.

861
01:24:55,633 --> 01:24:56,884
Okay, mister, huh?

862
01:24:58,678 --> 01:25:01,555
You shitheads! You bastards!

863
01:25:03,641 --> 01:25:07,144
Please, mister, I beg you. Let me go.

864
01:25:07,353 --> 01:25:09,813
I'll give you my food stand, okay?

865
01:25:09,981 --> 01:25:13,066
I'll give the rights to you.

866
01:25:13,234 --> 01:25:15,652
What are you doing?
Please, mister! Wait!

867
01:25:17,488 --> 01:25:22,034
Fuck! This is driving me crazy!

868
01:25:22,201 --> 01:25:24,161
I really need to get to Hyun-seo!

869
01:25:24,954 --> 01:25:28,832
Mister, please save me!
What is this, please?

870
01:25:30,335 --> 01:25:33,545
Hyun-seo, I'm sorry. Daddy...

871
01:25:41,512 --> 01:25:44,389
Hyun-seo, you know what I want?

872
01:25:44,682 --> 01:25:45,849
Banana milk.

873
01:25:49,103 --> 01:25:51,188
Tell me what you want, then.

874
01:25:51,356 --> 01:25:54,316
Make a list of the top 10 things
you want to eat...

875
01:25:54,484 --> 01:25:56,151
...when we get out.

876
01:25:57,362 --> 01:25:59,863
We have a food stand,
so I'll get you whatever you want.

877
01:26:00,031 --> 01:26:03,075
A stand? I want to live there!

878
01:26:03,534 --> 01:26:05,202
What about your home?

879
01:26:06,037 --> 01:26:07,537
I don't have a home.

880
01:26:07,830 --> 01:26:08,997
Really?

881
01:26:10,959 --> 01:26:13,794
No home,
but a lot of homes.

882
01:26:14,545 --> 01:26:15,921
And your mom and dad?

883
01:26:17,131 --> 01:26:19,299
I have a brother, but no brother.

884
01:26:24,430 --> 01:26:26,723
- Muscleman Sausage!
- We got it!

885
01:26:27,225 --> 01:26:29,726
- Hard-boiled eggs.
- We got it.

886
01:26:29,894 --> 01:26:32,020
Hot dogs! Quail's eggs!

887
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:33,480
Fried chicken!

888
01:26:35,149 --> 01:26:36,149
Instant noodles!

889
01:26:37,110 --> 01:26:38,276
Of course we do.

890
01:26:38,444 --> 01:26:40,904
Then you must eat them every day?

891
01:26:42,699 --> 01:26:45,117
Kids from Chinese restaurants
don't eat dumplings.

892
01:26:49,414 --> 01:26:52,124
What do you want
to eat most of all?

893
01:26:55,211 --> 01:26:58,005
Beer. A cold beer.

894
01:26:59,298 --> 01:27:01,425
- One, two, three!
- One, two, three!

895
01:27:28,119 --> 01:27:30,662
Se-joo, you've
ridden piggyback before?

896
01:27:30,830 --> 01:27:31,872
Yeah.

897
01:27:54,353 --> 01:27:55,520
Another man's coming out.

898
01:27:56,064 --> 01:27:59,900
Please, this time,
a guy with a working cell phone.

899
01:29:50,595 --> 01:29:51,595
Hey!

900
01:29:52,346 --> 01:29:53,346
Dink!

901
01:30:04,066 --> 01:30:05,567
Everyone look here.

902
01:30:06,235 --> 01:30:09,279
See this? Get on the floor! Move!

903
01:30:09,906 --> 01:30:12,574
Hey, fat ass! Get on the floor!

904
01:30:13,159 --> 01:30:15,118
- Get down...
- You like viruses?

905
01:30:15,286 --> 01:30:16,786
I'll stick it right in your body.

906
01:30:16,954 --> 01:30:20,123
You're not lying down?
You want a virus bath?

907
01:30:22,627 --> 01:30:25,295
- You at the end! Open the door, fast!
- Open it!

908
01:30:25,463 --> 01:30:26,463
You want to do it?

909
01:30:27,131 --> 01:30:29,633
- That's right! Open it!
- Open it.

910
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:31,301
- That one!
- Open it.

911
01:30:32,470 --> 01:30:35,138
Open them all!

912
01:30:43,147 --> 01:30:45,815
Everybody get down!
You bastards!

913
01:30:45,983 --> 01:30:47,484
Get down!

914
01:30:47,652 --> 01:30:50,654
Where's the car?

915
01:30:52,490 --> 01:30:56,201
You feasting out here?
Out of the way!

916
01:30:58,412 --> 01:31:00,747
I'm going to kill everyone!

917
01:31:01,207 --> 01:31:02,874
Hey, start the engine!

918
01:31:03,167 --> 01:31:06,461
If anyone follows, I'll stick her
full of virus! Start the engine!

919
01:31:06,796 --> 01:31:08,797
Ambulance!

920
01:31:38,452 --> 01:31:39,786
What are you doing?

921
01:31:40,079 --> 01:31:42,080
What? Who are you?

922
01:31:42,248 --> 01:31:46,084
You punk. After letting you
sleep in my bed?

923
01:31:46,669 --> 01:31:49,462
Mister, where's Wonhyo Bridge?

924
01:31:49,630 --> 01:31:50,630
Where do I have to go?

925
01:31:50,798 --> 01:31:53,466
Don't have a cow.
Do you even know where you are?

926
01:31:53,759 --> 01:31:55,427
I'm in a real hurry!

927
01:31:56,554 --> 01:31:58,221
How can I get to a main road?

928
01:31:58,389 --> 01:31:59,723
Figure it out yourself.

929
01:32:04,145 --> 01:32:06,187
Mister, I need some soju bottles.

930
01:32:06,731 --> 01:32:09,065
Wow, this is a nice bag.

931
01:32:12,528 --> 01:32:14,029
Here, I'll give you money.

932
01:32:19,577 --> 01:32:23,246
Think money can buy you anything?

933
01:32:24,540 --> 01:32:27,709
Well, I'm bored anyway.
Wonhyo Bridge?

934
01:32:28,961 --> 01:32:30,295
Okay, Wonhyo bridge.

935
01:32:30,504 --> 01:32:32,172
Jesus Christ.

936
01:32:32,340 --> 01:32:33,506
What the hell?

937
01:32:33,674 --> 01:32:36,301
What are you two doing back there?

938
01:32:36,469 --> 01:32:40,013
Who uses those at demonstrations
these days, you blockhead?

939
01:32:40,181 --> 01:32:43,183
I told you,
it's not for a demonstration.

940
01:32:43,351 --> 01:32:45,560
Get out! I'll pull over, so get out!

941
01:32:45,936 --> 01:32:48,438
Just keep driving.
I'm paying quadruple fare.

942
01:32:48,606 --> 01:32:49,606
Quadruple?

943
01:32:49,774 --> 01:32:53,151
Look at his hands work.
He's a master!

944
01:32:53,319 --> 01:32:57,322
You said the north side of Wonhyo?
That won't be easy.

945
01:32:57,698 --> 01:33:00,533
You see everyone
heading in that direction?

946
01:33:00,701 --> 01:33:04,579
<i>- Demonstrators are now gathering...
- It's a total mess today.</i>

947
01:33:04,747 --> 01:33:08,666
<i>...at the Agent Yellow release point.</i>

948
01:33:08,834 --> 01:33:11,753
<i>The police have virtually
given up controlling...</i>

949
01:33:11,921 --> 01:33:14,005
<i>...the Han River restricted area...</i>

950
01:33:14,173 --> 01:33:17,842
<i>...as demonstrators have broken
past all barricades.</i>

951
01:33:24,433 --> 01:33:38,405
Hyun-seo!

952
01:34:26,203 --> 01:34:28,371
Are you okay, Se-joo?

953
01:34:29,457 --> 01:34:31,458
I'm hungry.

954
01:34:35,546 --> 01:34:37,547
And blood keeps coming out.

955
01:34:38,883 --> 01:34:41,050
- It's okay.
- I'm hot...

956
01:34:44,388 --> 01:34:45,889
I'm hot...

957
01:35:53,791 --> 01:35:54,791
Se-joo...

958
01:35:57,169 --> 01:36:00,171
...just stay right here.

959
01:36:01,465 --> 01:36:04,300
Don't come out, whatever happens.

960
01:36:06,303 --> 01:36:07,470
Why?

961
01:36:10,474 --> 01:36:12,308
I'll be right back.

962
01:36:13,310 --> 01:36:14,477
I'll bring...

963
01:36:15,729 --> 01:36:16,980
...doctors...

964
01:36:17,481 --> 01:36:18,815
...911...

965
01:36:20,693 --> 01:36:22,026
...the police...

966
01:36:23,153 --> 01:36:24,487
...the military...

967
01:36:25,197 --> 01:36:26,864
...l'll bring them all.

968
01:36:27,658 --> 01:36:29,659
Take me with you.

969
01:38:22,981 --> 01:38:24,315
Se-joo...

970
01:38:32,116 --> 01:38:33,449
Go in...

971
01:39:56,283 --> 01:40:06,042
Hyun-seo!

972
01:40:51,755 --> 01:40:52,922
Gang-du!

973
01:41:08,021 --> 01:41:09,438
Come on!

974
01:41:22,452 --> 01:41:24,203
Hyun-seo!

975
01:41:24,621 --> 01:41:27,206
It's Daddy!

976
01:42:11,835 --> 01:42:14,128
What are you doing?

977
01:42:14,838 --> 01:42:16,172
Look.

978
01:42:24,598 --> 01:42:26,724
It's here!

979
01:42:27,100 --> 01:42:29,435
Everyone run!

980
01:42:41,573 --> 01:42:44,033
No, don't shoot!

981
01:42:44,868 --> 01:42:46,535
Don't shoot!

982
01:42:48,872 --> 01:42:50,122
Gang-du!

983
01:42:50,374 --> 01:42:51,374
Hey!

984
01:42:51,667 --> 01:42:54,543
Isn't that Gang-du?
What the hell?

985
01:43:25,826 --> 01:43:28,869
Don't shoot!

986
01:43:31,373 --> 01:43:32,999
I said don't shoot!

987
01:46:31,678 --> 01:46:32,845
Gang-du!

988
01:50:40,844 --> 01:50:42,636
Were you with Hyun-seo?

989
01:50:45,181 --> 01:50:46,723
Did you know Hyun-seo?

990
01:50:57,068 --> 01:50:58,444
Who are you?

991
01:50:58,695 --> 01:51:01,655
Were you with Hyun-seo?

992
01:53:39,689 --> 01:53:41,023
Let's eat.

993
01:53:44,485 --> 01:53:46,028
<i>A moment ago, at 11:30 p.m...</i>

994
01:53:46,195 --> 01:53:48,530
<i>...the U.S. Senate
Investigating Committee...</i>

995
01:53:48,698 --> 01:53:52,367
<i>...announced its findings regarding
the Korean virus incident.</i>

996
01:53:52,535 --> 01:53:54,911
<i>Let's go to the announcement.</i>

997
01:53:59,042 --> 01:54:00,876
There's nothing good on.

998
01:54:02,128 --> 01:54:04,338
Should we watch something else?

999
01:54:04,505 --> 01:54:07,215
Let's turn it off.
Concentrate on eating.

1000
01:54:11,888 --> 01:54:14,473
Where's the remote?

1001
01:54:39,933 --> 01:59:50,000
