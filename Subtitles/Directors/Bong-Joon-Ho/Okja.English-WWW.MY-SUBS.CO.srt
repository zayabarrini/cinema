I'm Lucy, Lucy Mirando,

but, uh...

17

29

This beautiful and special little creature

30
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:50,461
was miraculously discovered
on one Chilean farm.

31
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:55,587
We brought this precious girl
to the Mirando Ranch in Arizona.

32
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:59,804
Our scientists have been raising her
with love and care ever since,

34
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:08,395
And we've successfully reproduced
26 miracle piglets

35
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:11,106
by non forced, natural mating.

36

They are like nothing on Earth.

37
00:03:20,324 --> 00:03:24,824
Last week, we sent the 26 super piglets

38

to the 26 countries
where the Mirando offices are located.

39
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:33,796
Each one was given
to an esteemed local farmer.

40
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:38,300
I have asked each farmer
to raise their special guest,

unique to their respective cultures.

whatever support is required.

44

These little piggies will be the ancestors
of a whole new species.

00:19:29,292 --> 00:19:31,544
[whispering]
I thought a bunch of you were coming.

170
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,796
They're behind me.

171
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:35,465
Okja!

172
00:19:35,548 --> 00:19:36,882
[Okja squeals]

173
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,886
Always on top of her dental hygiene!

174
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:43,181
[Mija] Wait, wait. Let me out, Okja.

175
00:19:43,264 --> 00:19:44,473
Mundo?

176
00:19:45,558 --> 00:19:47,017
Hello, Mundo.

177
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:49,104
-Did you brush your own teeth?
-Yeah.

178
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:51,981
[sighs]

179
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:58,446
[computer chimes]

180
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:01,866
Retina Display!

181
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,284
Bring me the black box.

182
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:07,205
[Okja grunts]

183
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:21,594
Does Okja eat and poop well?

184
00:20:22,178 --> 00:20:25,097
[Mija]
Yes, and she has a super high metabolism.

185
00:20:26,057 --> 00:20:27,933
[Mundo]
Right. That's what the readings say.

186
00:20:28,017 --> 00:20:29,393
[Johnny in English] Fuck me!

187
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,605
[all panting and whimpering]

188
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:41,781
[panting] I'm here!

189
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:45,410
All right!

190
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:50,248
I'm fucking here, God damn it!

191
00:20:54,085 --> 00:20:57,088
[in Korean] He... he's that guy!
From TV, right?

192
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:58,298
He is.

193
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:02,093
What was it? Animal Magic!

194
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:04,888
He's the "very healthy" guy!

195
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:10,560
[in English] All the other super pigs were
on flat land, accessible by car.

196
00:21:11,394 --> 00:21:13,979
Japan's one was five minutes
from the airport.

197
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:19,694
And you... I notice that you had to leave
the fucking mountaintop super pig

198
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:23,114
till the end, because you knew
that the climb would rile me.

199
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:25,575
Well, guess what? I'm riled.

200
00:21:25,658 --> 00:21:28,202
[in Korean] Wow.
He looks exactly like he does on TV.

201
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:35,084
[in English] Oh, that's great.

202
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:36,878
[retching]

203
00:21:38,546 --> 00:21:39,630
Can somebody...

204
00:21:40,256 --> 00:21:42,549
Can somebody at least bring me some water?

205
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:45,845
Seeing as I'm about to be filmed
for fucking television!

206
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:48,598
And not sparkling water. I don't want
to belch my way through the broadcast.

207
00:21:48,681 --> 00:21:49,723
Get him some water.

208
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:52,185
I don't think they have
sparkling water here.

209
00:21:52,268 --> 00:21:53,519
[in Korean] Excuse me, sir.

210
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:57,648
If you don't mind,
Dr. Johnny's a bit thirsty.

211
00:21:58,233 --> 00:21:59,442
Thank you.

212
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,903
[in English] Here's your water.

213
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:04,155
[in Korean] Wait, that's Soju...

214
00:22:04,739 --> 00:22:08,200
Hey, that's mine...

215
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:12,705
[bottle clatters]

00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,418
[gasps]

217
00:22:20,755 --> 00:22:24,008
Hey, Okja. It's okay. Come on out.

218
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:26,761
That's it. Very good.

219
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,013
[Johnny gasps]

220
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:49,492
Well, fucking film me, Jennifer!

221
00:22:50,743 --> 00:22:52,327
You can't fake these emotions.

222
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:54,455
[Jennifer] Oh! Uh, film him. Um...

223
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,457
Get him his uniform. Quick.

224
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,543
-Oh!
-[speaks indistinctly in Korean]

225
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:01,504
-[man exclaims]
-[Mija] They're filming!

226
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:03,506
[Jennifer in English]
Pick up his bag. Come on. Uh...

227
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,717
Oh, that's it. Is your... Mundo?

228
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,303
Mundo, get out of the shot, please.
Thank you very much. That's it.

229
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:12,139
And, uh, his hat. Get his hat.
Looking good, Dr. Johnny.

230
00:23:12,223 --> 00:23:13,557
That's it. Everything's gonna be okay.

231
00:23:13,641 --> 00:23:15,934
Mundo, get out of the shot.
Thank you very much.

232
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:17,437
And... roll.

233
00:23:18,521 --> 00:23:23,021
Ten years ago, 26 local farmers
from 26 far-flung countries

234
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:26,153
were each given a super piglet.
This year, I traveled to each...

235
00:23:26,237 --> 00:23:28,197
-[in Korean] What's he saying?
-Dunno.

236
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:32,660
...one of those 26 farms to decide who
will be invited to The Best Super Pig Fest

237
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:37,244
in New York City,
where it will be unveiled to the world.

238
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:41,210
You've done an incredible job.

239
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:42,753
Thank you.

240
00:23:42,837 --> 00:23:44,004
Pan to the old man!

241
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:47,633
-[Jennifer] Oh! Pan to Johnny.
-[Choi] Johnny, Johnny!

242
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:50,511
Ever since she was little,
I've always been fascinated with Okja

243
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:52,888
and her monthly health reports and data.

244
00:23:52,972 --> 00:23:55,349
I've only known her through numbers
and graphs and pictures,

245
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:56,851
but seeing her here today,

246
00:23:56,935 --> 00:24:00,313
and studying her
with my own eyes and hands,

247
00:24:00,396 --> 00:24:02,481
she amazes me even more.

248
00:24:02,565 --> 00:24:04,650
This is it. The moment of mutual trust

249
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:09,234
between Mirando's very own Dr. Johnny
and the esteemed local farmer.

250
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:13,826
-[sloshing]
-[Okja grunting]

251
00:24:15,411 --> 00:24:17,371
She's truly exceptional.

252
00:24:20,249 --> 00:24:22,960
How did you do it? What were your methods?

253
00:24:23,836 --> 00:24:25,420

254
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:26,631

He just let her run around.

257
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:34,389
"He just let her run around.”
How beguiling!

258
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:37,516
Show the sash to the camera, Jennifer,
and go!

259
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:43,523
-Ready for the festival in New York City?
-New York?

Very healthy.

263
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:55,826
One more sash, please.

264
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:06,045
A special sash for a special little lady,

265
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:09,674
who I'm sure helped raise this super pig
in her own special little way.

266
00:25:10,633 --> 00:25:13,427
And cut. Get some cutaways of the pig!

267
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:15,054
[Choi speaking Korean]

268
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:20,518
Here. Autograph, please.

269
00:25:20,601 --> 00:25:23,478
Oh, I guess I'm still hip in Korea.
[chuckles]

270
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:25,982
The kids at home don't really
appreciate me anymore.

271
00:25:26,065 --> 00:25:28,233
But here... [laughing]

272
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:32,113
I'm sorry if I was a little grumpy
when I first came to the farm.

273
00:25:32,196 --> 00:25:34,990
But, you know, being
a television presenter can be stressful.

274
00:25:35,491 --> 00:25:38,744
I always have to be "on"...

275
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:42,582
now that I'm the face
of the Mirando Corporation.

276
00:25:43,249 --> 00:25:45,376
Whoever thought that would happen?
[laughs]

277
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,800
[in Korean] Mija.
Let's go visit your mom and dad.

278
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:55,761
Now? I want to watch this.

279
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:58,639
They'll be doing this all day.

280
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:02,852
Your mom and dad appeared
in my dream last night

281
00:26:02,935 --> 00:26:05,312
and said they missed you.

282
00:26:05,396 --> 00:26:06,647
Come on.

283
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:08,816
[in English] Thank you.

284
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,407
[in Korean] Come quick.

285
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:18,910
It won't take long.

286
00:26:22,705 --> 00:26:24,373
[all exclaiming]

[Okja squealing]

288
00:26:34,383 --> 00:26:38,595
Who do you miss more?

289
00:26:39,305 --> 00:26:41,682
Mom or dad?

290
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:44,685
I can't remember...

their faces.

292
00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:54,107
It's been so many years.

293
00:26:55,321 --> 00:26:59,821
Just the two of us in the mountains.

294
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:02,620
Not two. Three.

295
00:27:02,703 --> 00:27:03,912
Huh?

00:27:05,456 --> 00:27:07,708
Oh, sure. Three.

[laughing]

298
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,128
The three of us.

299
00:27:14,423 --> 00:27:16,383
Okja, too.

300
00:27:16,467 --> 00:27:17,593
[continues laughing]

301
00:27:20,596 --> 00:27:21,972
Ta-da!

302
00:27:22,056 --> 00:27:24,183
Our little fatty!

303
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:26,977
What's that?

304
00:27:27,728 --> 00:27:28,812
This is...

305
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:30,731
a gold pig.

306
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:35,486
100% real gold.

307
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,071
In the old days,

308
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:42,656
the elders would give a gold pig
to their daughters as a wedding gift.

309
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:48,999
Mija, it's yours now.

310
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:50,959
Take it.

311
00:27:52,086 --> 00:27:54,129
Why all of a sudden?

312
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,929
[sighs]

313
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:09,061
Well, you're not getting married now.

314
00:28:10,688 --> 00:28:15,188
But Okja is going far away.

315
00:28:17,695 --> 00:28:22,195
So you can keep this gold pig instead.

316
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,829
What?

317
00:28:27,413 --> 00:28:31,913
The pig competition's nearly over.

318
00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:37,256
So they're taking all the pigs back
to the company.

319
00:28:37,965 --> 00:28:39,424
But Okja's ours.

320
00:28:40,134 --> 00:28:41,593
We bought her from them.

321
00:28:42,261 --> 00:28:44,429
You sent them the money!

322
00:28:45,556 --> 00:28:46,848
Actually,

323
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:50,019
they wouldn't let me buy Okja.

324
00:28:50,102 --> 00:28:54,231
So I bought you this gold pig instead.

325
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,527
-[shouts] What are you talking about?
-Huh?

326
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:00,904
[chuckling]

00:29:02,281 --> 00:29:03,865
Hey, did you hear that?

00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:36,373
This isn't about you or us,
and she is Okja's family.

656
00:55:36,457 --> 00:55:38,000
So of course we need her consent.

657
00:55:38,084 --> 00:55:41,504
I will not harm her by forcing a mission
upon her that she does not consent to.

658
00:55:41,587 --> 00:55:44,590
As members of the ALF,
we are obliged to honor its credo.

659
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:49,011
We are going to abort because some guy
from the 1970s wrote a fucking credo?

660
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:50,721
Is that what you're saying?

661
00:55:50,805 --> 00:55:52,932
[Blond] Tradition does not make
a movement strong.

662
00:55:53,015 --> 00:55:54,182
[Silver coughing]

663
00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:56,143
We make a movement strong.

664
00:55:56,227 --> 00:55:58,896
If that's how you feel, call yourself
something else and not the ALF

665
00:55:58,980 --> 00:55:59,981
and get out of this truck.

666
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:06,024
In order to expose Mirando,
we need video from inside the lab.

667
00:56:07,029 --> 00:56:08,822
And this is where Okja comes in.

668
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:13,494
The Mirando scientists are dying to run
tests on her in their underground lab.

669
00:56:13,578 --> 00:56:16,622
Their star super pig.
Which is why we've made this.

670
00:56:18,374 --> 00:56:21,293
It looks exactly like the black box
on her ear, right?

671
00:56:22,211 --> 00:56:26,711
Only this one can wirelessly send
a video feed to us from inside the lab.

672
00:56:27,091 --> 00:56:30,135
[in Korean]
Okja will become a hidden camera.

673
00:56:31,012 --> 00:56:32,096
[in English] Hey, Buddy.

674
00:56:32,179 --> 00:56:33,597
[shushing] Hi.

675
00:56:34,223 --> 00:56:35,224
Okay.

676
00:56:35,808 --> 00:56:39,728
-[Okja grunts]
-[Jay] I'm sorry, but this was our plan.

677
00:56:40,938 --> 00:56:45,438
Rescue Okja, replace the black box
and let Mirando retake Okja.

678
00:56:46,944 --> 00:56:50,948
[in Korean]
You want to send Okja to America?

679
00:56:51,657 --> 00:56:52,783
To this laboratory?

680
00:56:52,867 --> 00:56:54,618
[in English] Yes. But don't worry.

681
00:56:56,495 --> 00:56:57,954
They wouldn't dare hurt her.

682
00:56:58,956 --> 00:57:01,750
She needs to be perfect
for their beauty pageant.

683
00:57:01,834 --> 00:57:05,295
Whatever tests they do on her in there
will need to be harmless.

684
00:57:05,379 --> 00:57:09,341
We have a detailed plan on how to rescue
her from the event in New York City.

685
00:57:09,425 --> 00:57:11,552
We promise to bring her back to you.

686
00:57:14,847 --> 00:57:16,306
If our mission succeeds,

687
00:57:16,390 --> 00:57:19,684
we'll be able to shut down Mirando's
super pig project completely.

688
00:57:20,686 --> 00:57:25,186
And we'll be saving millions
of super pigs like Okja from death.

689
00:57:26,150 --> 00:57:28,652
But we won't do it without your approval.

690
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:33,532
[in Korean] If you don't approve,
we won't do the mission.

691
00:57:36,410 --> 00:57:37,661
What is your decision?

692
00:57:38,704 --> 00:57:40,872
-[translates]
-Take Okja back to the mountains.

693
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:44,168
-[in English] She agrees to the mission.
-[Okja groans]

694
00:57:46,170 --> 00:57:47,379
[Silver] Thank you.

695
00:57:47,463 --> 00:57:51,963
-Thank you so much.
-This is a giant leap for animal kind.

696
00:57:53,844 --> 00:57:54,845
Thank you.

697
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:56,597
[K] It's Ziploc.

-[Blond] Water won't be so bad.
-Oh, it'll be great!

-[Silver screaming]

Go, go, go, go, go, go.

704

[in Korean] Hey!

705
00:58:37,138 --> 00:58:39,473
Okja, I'll see you in New York.

706
00:58:40,182 --> 00:58:41,224
[Mija] Huh?

707
00:58:41,308 --> 00:58:42,434
Till we meet again.

708
00:58:44,770 --> 00:58:49,270
[in Korean] Mija! Try learning English.
It opens new doors!

709
00:58:49,817 --> 00:58:51,443
[Mija] Hey, wait! Mister!

710

[officer in Korean] Hey, you!

712
00:59:02,747 --> 00:59:04,165
Grab him!

713
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:07,168
He jumped! How did he do that?

714
00:59:08,335 --> 00:59:10,670
Hey, kid. It's dangerous.

715
00:59:10,755 --> 00:59:12,548
Get out of there.

716
00:59:14,383 --> 00:59:17,302
-Hey, kid. Hey, come out!
-[both shouting]

717

-Are you kidding me?
-It's supposed to hold.

718
00:59:35,446 --> 00:59:37,114
You're a fucking joke-show, mate.

719
00:59:38,282 --> 00:59:40,450
-Fucking awesome, epic plan, man.
-It's a Ziploc.

720
00:59:40,534 --> 00:59:42,827
-Fucking Ziploc, my ass.
-It was supposed to hold.

721
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:43,913
Seriously?

722
00:59:43,996 --> 00:59:46,873
-You okay?
-Yeah. Yeah.

723
00:59:50,503 --> 00:59:51,837
[Okja groans wearily]

724
00:59:59,428 --> 01:00:01,471
[news anchor in English]
Last night in South Korea,

725
01:00:01,555 --> 01:00:05,016
Mirando employees were securing
their super pig when a young girl

726
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:07,103
suddenly stepped in
and tried to stop them.

727
01:00:07,186 --> 01:00:09,563
These extraordinary events began
earlier in the day

728
01:00:09,647 --> 01:00:14,147
with a highly-organized pig napping attempt
made by the Animal Liberation Front.

729
01:00:14,735 --> 01:00:18,488
I wouldn't worry too much, Luce.
The ALF technically failed.

730
01:00:18,572 --> 01:00:20,198
They weren't even able
to take the product.

731
01:00:20,282 --> 01:00:24,119
Yeah, it's a kerfuffle over nothing.
We shouldn't make a big deal out of it.

732
01:00:24,203 --> 01:00:27,331
It actually means our security here
in the US is so airtight,

733
01:00:27,414 --> 01:00:29,374
they wouldn't even think
about breaking in.

734
01:00:29,458 --> 01:00:31,042
Which is why they went all the way
to Korea.

735
01:00:31,127 --> 01:00:34,004
The ALF hasn't been in the headlines
for a number of years,

736
01:00:34,088 --> 01:00:37,841
but they're back in the spotlight
after today's chaotic events.

737
01:00:37,925 --> 01:00:40,886
Well, the good news is that the pig
is on its way to New York now.

738
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:44,723
Right. And the Best Super Pig Fest
will continue as planned. [chuckles]

739
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:48,519
Significant damage to Mirando's
stock price seems I inevitable.

740
01:00:48,602 --> 01:00:51,229
Yeah. Mirando is completely fucked.

741
01:00:51,313 --> 01:00:54,274
Mirando.
That's your current employer, correct?

742
01:00:54,358 --> 01:00:56,735
Yup. But I don't care.

743
01:00:56,819 --> 01:01:00,030
They fucked, not me. They fucked up.

744
01:01:00,698 --> 01:01:02,116
[news theme music playing]

745
01:01:05,661 --> 01:01:08,413
[Lucy] I know what they're calling me,
those ALF fuckers.

746
01:01:09,123 --> 01:01:10,916
They're calling me a psychopath.

747
01:01:13,335 --> 01:01:14,836
You're not a psychopath.

748
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:17,339
They're the psychopaths.
Right, Ms. Mirando?

749
01:01:18,257 --> 01:01:19,716
They're narcissists.

750
01:01:22,511 --> 01:01:24,262
[Lucy] Do narcissists wear balaclavas?

751
01:01:24,346 --> 01:01:28,183
[scoffs] Crazy radicals have been
calling us psychopaths since the '60s.

752
01:01:28,267 --> 01:01:29,935
"You're a psychopath.

753
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:33,856
Your sister was a psychopath.
Your father was a psychopath.”

754
01:01:33,939 --> 01:01:37,943
Well, Daddy was a psychopath, Frank.
I mean, that's hardly an unfair slur.

755
01:01:40,321 --> 01:01:42,031
"What did you do in the war, Daddy?"

756
01:01:42,615 --> 01:01:45,618
"I manufactured the napalm
that made everybody's skin fall off."

757
01:01:45,701 --> 01:01:46,702
[chuckles]

758
01:01:48,078 --> 01:01:50,830
And this is a man
who called his child an idiot loser.

759
01:01:53,250 --> 01:01:56,628
Well, in fairness to your father,
when he called you an idiot loser,

760
01:01:56,712 --> 01:01:58,588
you had just signed up
for a course in California

761
01:01:58,672 --> 01:02:00,965
called "Unleash Your Calling."

762
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:04,094
At a highly-respected institute
for the advancement of human potential

763
01:02:04,178 --> 01:02:06,138
where many a forward-looking CEO go.

764
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:09,308
And you know what I was doing
while I was at the institute?

765
01:02:09,391 --> 01:02:13,891
I was visualizing new
and better ways of doing business.

766
01:02:14,939 --> 01:02:17,358
While my sister was CEO...
What was the name of that lake?

767
01:02:17,441 --> 01:02:18,650
Moose Lake.

768
01:02:18,734 --> 01:02:21,570
Moose Lake. While my sister was CEO,

769
01:02:21,654 --> 01:02:25,032
dumping so much toxic waste
into Moose Lake that it exploded...

770
01:02:25,115 --> 01:02:27,951
The only lake ever to explode.
Well done, Nancy.

771
01:02:28,035 --> 01:02:32,535
I was visualizing ways of turning the most
hated agrochemical company in the world

772
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:38,879
into the most likable
miracle pig-rearing company.

773
01:02:38,963 --> 01:02:40,965
And it's working! It's working!

774
01:02:41,048 --> 01:02:44,384
It was working until last night.

775
01:02:44,468 --> 01:02:46,261
Until six hours ago.

776
01:02:46,845 --> 01:02:51,345
The synthesis of old Mirando
and new Mirando was impeccable.

777
01:02:54,144 --> 01:02:57,272
I took nature and science,

778
01:02:58,190 --> 01:02:59,941
and I synthesized.

779
01:03:00,567 --> 01:03:02,360
And everyone loved it.

780
01:03:03,153 --> 01:03:06,573
You remember what the Mew York Times
said about our super pigs?

781
01:03:06,657 --> 01:03:08,492
"Intriguing,” right?

782
01:03:08,575 --> 01:03:12,203
Slate. "Lucy Mirando is pulling off
the impossible.

783
01:03:12,288 --> 01:03:14,790
She is making us fall in love
with a creature

784
01:03:14,873 --> 01:03:16,791
that we are already looking forward
to eating."

785
01:03:16,875 --> 01:03:20,545
I mean, these are journalists
who never write about pigs.

786
01:03:20,629 --> 01:03:23,965
They never write about pigs!
They wrote about our pigs.

787
01:03:24,633 --> 01:03:26,217
Ten years in planning!

788
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:29,972
On the cusp of a product launch
that will feed millions!

789
01:03:30,055 --> 01:03:31,598
And what happens?

790
01:03:31,682 --> 01:03:34,935
We get tangled up in this terrorism thing,

791
01:03:35,019 --> 01:03:38,230
and somehow we end up being
the ones who look bad.

792
01:03:38,314 --> 01:03:40,941
[chuckles] We don't look too bad.

793
01:03:41,025 --> 01:03:44,445
-We don't? Open that thing!
-Yup.

794
01:03:46,905 --> 01:03:48,615
No, rewind. Rewind.

795
01:03:50,534 --> 01:03:51,785
Rewind!

796
01:03:52,619 --> 01:03:53,620
Okay, play.

797
01:03:54,621 --> 01:03:57,040
[male anchor] The girl was later revealed
to be the granddaughter

798
01:03:57,124 --> 01:04:00,085
of a local farmer selected by Mirando CEO...

799
01:04:00,169 --> 01:04:01,461
[Lucy] Pause, there.

800
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:03,338
That's it.

That's the image.

802
01:04:06,091 --> 01:04:08,968
That is the image
that is gonna destroy us.

803
01:04:09,762 --> 01:04:11,972
Who are those morons?

804
01:04:12,056 --> 01:04:13,599
Find out and fire them.

805
01:04:15,476 --> 01:04:16,477
Sure.

806
01:04:17,478 --> 01:04:19,354
Abusing that adorable girl.

807
01:04:20,189 --> 01:04:23,025
And in the uniforms
that I personally designed myself.

808
01:04:24,026 --> 01:04:26,570
And shoving her best friend onto a truck.

809
01:04:27,446 --> 01:04:28,780
[breathes shakily]

810
01:04:34,119 --> 01:04:35,370
That's gonna Kill us.

811
01:04:36,622 --> 01:04:38,248
Right there. That's it.

812
01:04:38,832 --> 01:04:41,251
That image. We're dead.

813
01:05:08,195 --> 01:05:09,863
[machine whirring]

814
01:05:17,287 --> 01:05:18,705
[sniffing]

815
01:05:19,832 --> 01:05:22,417
Lucy, may I ask you a question?

816
01:05:24,169 --> 01:05:27,422
The girl. You're thinking of bringing her
to New York, aren't you?

817
01:05:28,340 --> 01:05:29,841
I was about to say that!

818
01:05:29,925 --> 01:05:31,927
Yes, of course.

819
01:05:32,010 --> 01:05:34,470
You'll invite her
to The Best Super Pig Festival and...

820
01:05:35,139 --> 01:05:36,640
A moving reunion!

821
01:05:37,641 --> 01:05:40,685
The best super pig and the adorable
farmer girl forced apart

822
01:05:40,769 --> 01:05:43,062
and somehow brought together on our stage.

823
01:05:43,147 --> 01:05:44,398
Brilliant, Lucy.

824
01:05:44,481 --> 01:05:47,734
An emotional reunion,
and then they leave the stage together.

825
01:05:47,818 --> 01:05:50,028
Hand in hand. Hand in trotter.

826
01:05:50,654 --> 01:05:53,114
She can be the new face
of the Mirando Corporation.

827
01:05:53,198 --> 01:05:55,783
She can be the embodiment
of the Mirando ideal.

828
01:05:55,868 --> 01:05:58,245
She's young, she's pretty, she's female.

829
01:05:58,328 --> 01:06:01,456
She's eco-friendly and she's global!
She's a godsend!

830
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:03,792
-Are you writing this down?
-[knock on door]

831
01:06:03,876 --> 01:06:04,960
Hey!

832
01:06:08,505 --> 01:06:11,007
She's not the face
of the Mirando Corporation. I am.

833
01:06:12,718 --> 01:06:15,137
You don't even know
if she can do anything but cry.

834
01:06:15,804 --> 01:06:17,847
Whereas I am loved...

835
01:06:20,017 --> 01:06:21,518
all over the world.

836
01:06:21,602 --> 01:06:25,272
Could you sit down and shut
the fucking squeaking and whining?

837
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:32,904
You know...

838
01:06:36,158 --> 01:06:40,078
you are forcing me... [chuckles]

839
01:06:40,162 --> 01:06:42,080
I'm forcing you to do what?

840
01:06:45,834 --> 01:06:48,336
To examine my options.

841
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:50,505
[Lucy] Oh, really? Okay.

842
01:06:50,589 --> 01:06:52,507
Go ahead. Examine them.

843
01:06:52,591 --> 01:06:56,136
Are you examining them now?
Have you finished examining them?

844
01:06:57,513 --> 01:06:59,181
Sit. You're a deadbeat.

845
01:06:59,264 --> 01:07:02,392
Your ratings are shit. Epic fail.

846
01:07:03,393 --> 01:07:05,686
Jennifer, get her a first class ticket.

847
01:07:05,771 --> 01:07:08,857
Get her a passport. She probably
hasn't got a passport. Get her a visa.

848
01:07:08,941 --> 01:07:11,234
We'll pay for all the damage
the super pig did in Korea.

849
01:07:11,318 --> 01:07:12,485
Get an attorney on that.

850
01:07:12,569 --> 01:07:16,197
Don't force an image on her,
like Benetton did with those Asian models.

851
01:07:16,281 --> 01:07:19,075
Oh, no. I have a much better idea.

852
01:07:20,077 --> 01:07:21,578
[speaking indistinctly]

853
01:07:26,083 --> 01:07:28,835
Okay, we got it all figured out.
We got a strategy. We got a plan.

854
01:07:28,919 --> 01:07:30,629
We're gonna think of it like a love story.

855
01:07:30,712 --> 01:07:33,464
That's what we're gonna do.
Hand those bits of paper out quickly.

856
01:07:33,549 --> 01:07:35,676
We got a little girl
running around the city all alone.

857
01:07:35,759 --> 01:07:37,469
We've got a big, big giant pig.

858
01:07:37,553 --> 01:07:40,472
We gotta bring them back together
because they miss each other.

859
01:07:40,556 --> 01:07:41,640
Now they go to New York City.

860
01:07:41,723 --> 01:07:43,891
Look at her, so sweet. Cute.
Totally gorgeous.

861
01:07:43,976 --> 01:07:45,477
Totally sexy. Hot, tiny, perfect.

862
01:07:46,687 --> 01:07:50,524
[in Korean] At this rate,
she'll be doing Mirando commercials.

863
01:07:50,607 --> 01:07:52,984
-It's very likely!
-Thank you!

864
01:07:53,068 --> 01:07:54,444
-Mija!
-Mija.

865
01:07:54,528 --> 01:07:56,780
Everything is worked out!
Don't worry about a thing.

866
01:07:56,863 --> 01:07:59,031
Let's take a photo
for our company Twitter.

867
01:07:59,116 --> 01:08:00,700
Hold this.

868
01:08:00,784 --> 01:08:01,993
[exclaims]

869
01:08:03,412 --> 01:08:05,038
Get Okja on the phone now!

870
01:08:05,122 --> 01:08:06,498
I want to know how she's doing.

871
01:08:06,582 --> 01:08:08,125
On the phone? With a pig?

872
01:08:08,208 --> 01:08:10,627
[Jennifer] And we gotta tell this
to everybody in New York City!

873
01:08:10,711 --> 01:08:13,797
On Instagram, on YouTube, on Tumblr,
on Facebook, on Twitter.

874
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:16,048
Okja. Okja, the giant pig.
She's, like, this big.

875
01:08:16,133 --> 01:08:17,634
She's, like, oh, my God. She's bigger.

876
01:08:17,718 --> 01:08:19,344
Yeah, she's got one big, giant nipple.

877
01:08:20,178 --> 01:08:22,221
[Mija] Hasn't Okja landed yet?

878
01:08:22,306 --> 01:08:24,141
Can we phone her now?

879
01:08:24,224 --> 01:08:26,100
Let's take a picture first, then call her.

880
01:08:26,184 --> 01:08:27,852
-Really?
-Of course.

881

In the plane, if you get airsick...

883
01:08:39,072 --> 01:08:40,865
chew the end of this.

884
01:08:40,949 --> 01:08:42,325
Like this, okay?

885
01:08:42,409 --> 01:08:44,994
Look at me.

886
01:08:45,078 --> 01:08:46,788
Mija. Take this.

887
01:08:46,872 --> 01:08:48,248

Hey, Nance.

894
01:09:43,762 --> 01:09:47,056
How's London? Is that rain?
That can't be good for the golf.

895
01:09:47,140 --> 01:09:48,891
Just letting you know I'm thinking of you.

896
01:09:48,975 --> 01:09:50,351
You're having a moment, I see.

897
01:09:50,435 --> 01:09:54,439
Yes, things are going super well.
It's all a massive success.

898
01:09:54,523 --> 01:09:55,732
Really?

899
01:09:55,816 --> 01:09:59,611
They keep showing very
unflattering pictures of you in the press.

900
01:09:59,695 --> 01:10:03,490
Those ones of you as a fat child
on Daddy's knee.

901
01:10:03,573 --> 01:10:05,199
Such nasty remarks.

902
01:10:05,951 --> 01:10:09,245
All eyes are on you, aren't they,
squeaky clean icon?

903
01:10:10,872 --> 01:10:13,457
I've sent you a reminder of the true face

904
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:17,754
of the most powerful CEO
Mirando has ever had.

905
01:10:17,838 --> 01:10:18,922
You go, girl.

906
01:10:22,509 --> 01:10:24,010
[Okja snorting]

907
01:10:32,477 --> 01:10:35,146
[K] Okay. Signal's good.

908
01:10:35,814 --> 01:10:37,232
We're seeing what Okja's seeing.

909
01:10:40,652 --> 01:10:42,320
Enjoy this moment.

910
01:10:42,404 --> 01:10:45,073
Because soon the whole world
will know what we know.

911
01:10:45,657 --> 01:10:48,743
Oh, my God, Jay.
We're about to change everything.

912
01:10:48,827 --> 01:10:50,787
With my shiny antennae. [chuckles]

913
01:10:50,871 --> 01:10:52,873
I'll put some distance
between us and them.

914
01:10:53,457 --> 01:10:55,584
We have to test
how far the signal reaches.

915
01:10:58,044 --> 01:10:59,336
[moans]

916

01:11:22,444 --> 01:11:23,820
-There she goes.
-[Silver] Wow.

918
01:11:23,904 --> 01:11:26,156
-Okja gets to see everything.
-Quiet.

919
01:11:26,740 --> 01:11:29,367
[K] This is historical. It's historical.
This is history.

Ah!

We're reunited.

01:12:00,774 --> 01:12:03,276
In this wretched laboratory, no less.

927
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:05,904
Someone you're going to find very special.

928
01:12:05,987 --> 01:12:08,614
Here is Alfonso!

929

Where is he?

930
01:12:11,493 --> 01:12:14,662
I got a special treat

Okja, Alfonso! Your boyfriend. [giggles]

[squealing loudly]

943
01:13:06,715 --> 01:13:08,800
We should never have sent her there.

944
01:13:08,884 --> 01:13:10,552
Can you turn it off, please?

945
01:13:12,137 --> 01:13:13,138
No.

946
01:13:13,847 --> 01:13:17,016
No, we need to record this.
We need to show this.

947

-[Blond] No, we didn't.

We didn't know
they were gonna do this to her.

We didn't know they were gonna
put her through this mating.

We suspected!

952

Come on, we all suspected.

-Turn it off!

But we can't be weak.

957

That's right.

This is why we need to stay focused.

959
01:13:54,512 --> 01:13:56,347
This is why we need
to stick to the mission.

960
01:13:56,431 --> 01:14:00,101
The little girl trusted us with Okja.
We have to respect her bravery.

She never agreed to send Okja.

She was in our truck.

She said... [speaking Korean]

[in English] "I wanna take Okja back
to the mountains."

01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:19,537
I lied.

968
01:14:22,874 --> 01:14:24,792
-[Red] God.
-Why did you lie?

969
01:14:26,002 --> 01:14:28,879
I don't know.
In that moment, it's just... I couldn't...

970
01:14:30,507 --> 01:14:32,091
I couldn't stop the mission.

971
01:14:32,884 --> 01:14:36,012
You know, this is...
this is the coolest mission ever.

972
01:14:36,096 --> 01:14:38,515
- I have all this stuff and—
-Hey, K... K.

973
01:14:38,598 --> 01:14:39,682
[shushing]

974
01:14:40,475 --> 01:14:41,851
It's okay.

975

[Silver yells]

976
01:14:45,814 --> 01:14:47,607
I hold you dear to my heart,

977
01:14:47,691 --> 01:14:50,151
but you have dishonored
the 40-year history

978
01:14:50,235 --> 01:14:53,696
and meaningful legacy
of the Animal Liberation Front.

979
01:14:53,780 --> 01:14:58,280
You have betrayed the great minds
and brave fighters that have preceded you.

980
01:14:59,786 --> 01:15:01,454
Never mistranslate.

981
01:15:01,538 --> 01:15:02,747
[K groans]

982
01:15:03,748 --> 01:15:05,458
Translation is sacred.

983
01:15:08,545 --> 01:15:09,754
From this moment on...

984
01:15:11,172 --> 01:15:15,050
you are no longer a member of the ALF.
You are permanently banned.

985
01:15:17,053 --> 01:15:18,054
Get out.

986
01:15:19,472 --> 01:15:20,598
However...

987
01:15:22,017 --> 01:15:24,936
since it is vital that we continue
with our mission...

988
01:15:25,645 --> 01:15:28,481
we will return your equipment to you
after its completion.

989
01:15:28,565 --> 01:15:32,026
Consider this your final contribution
to the ALF.

990
01:15:41,661 --> 01:15:43,871
[K] Ah, shit.

991
01:15:43,955 --> 01:15:45,539
[exhales] Oh, my God.

992
01:15:49,377 --> 01:15:50,461
You want some?

993
01:15:53,506 --> 01:15:54,924
[groans weakly]

994
01:15:58,511 --> 01:16:00,429
It'll make you feel better.

[crying]

996
01:16:18,156 --> 01:16:22,326
This is an unspeakable place.

997
01:16:25,497 --> 01:16:27,999
I know. I know.

998
01:16:28,083 --> 01:16:29,375
[continues crying]

999
01:16:33,046 --> 01:16:35,006
There are worse rooms out there.

1000
01:16:37,425 --> 01:16:41,011
Lucy Mirando says
I'm not supposed to harm you in here.

1001
01:16:41,096 --> 01:16:43,223
Well, at least not visibly.

1002
01:16:43,306 --> 01:16:47,393
She wants you perfect
for her big telecast!

1003
01:16:48,770 --> 01:16:49,771
But...

1004
01:16:52,982 --> 01:16:57,027
when a woman humiliates a man

1005
01:16:57,112 --> 01:16:59,447
in front of his own colleagues,

1006
01:16:59,531 --> 01:17:03,826
a man is inclined
to make his own decisions.

1007
01:17:09,374 --> 01:17:12,001
This is nothing, really.

1008
01:17:12,085 --> 01:17:15,338
It's used on beef. I mean, live cows.

1009
01:17:16,005 --> 01:17:17,548
To check their marbling.

1010
01:17:19,717 --> 01:17:21,093
[telephone ringing]

1011
01:17:24,139 --> 01:17:26,349
Hi, Dr. Johnny. Is Okja with you?

1012
01:17:26,432 --> 01:17:27,516
Yes!

1013
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:30,853
Our precious farmer princess insists
that she speaks to her on the phone.

1014
01:17:30,937 --> 01:17:32,355
What?

1015
01:17:32,438 --> 01:17:35,190
Whatever. She says you should lift
her ear and put the receiver underneath.

1016
01:17:35,775 --> 01:17:38,194
-You're on speakerphone!
-Okja!

1017

[Mija] Okja! Are you okay?

1020
01:17:43,491 --> 01:17:45,701
Okja! Okja! What did you say?

1021
01:17:45,785 --> 01:17:47,036
I can't hear you!

1022
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:49,664
Okja! Okja!

1023
01:17:49,747 --> 01:17:51,331
Okja! Are you okay?

1024

Ooh!

1027
01:18:21,279 --> 01:18:22,405
The shank.

1028
01:18:23,990 --> 01:18:27,201
Don't worry. You won't die.

1029
01:18:28,369 --> 01:18:30,662
We're just gonna take some of your meat.

1030
01:18:31,998 --> 01:18:35,918
And of course, I'm not gonna eat any.

1031
01:18:37,170 --> 01:18:39,046
We have tasters for that.

1032
01:18:39,839 --> 01:18:43,509
They're a bunch of half-wit,
degenerate fucktards!

1033
01:18:48,181 --> 01:18:52,351
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna poke you in five places.

1034
01:18:52,936 --> 01:18:56,397
And I'm sorry. It's gonna hurt.

1035
01:18:58,024 --> 01:18:59,692
I shouldn't be here.

1036

[stammering] I'm an animal lover.

Everybody knows that about me!

[Okja squeals]

1040
01:19:25,843 --> 01:19:26,844

Fuck, yeah.

1042
01:19:30,306 --> 01:19:34,806
That was the best I've ever had.
The best of the best.

[announcer] Today Mirando presents to you
our super gourmet sausage.

1045
01:19:46,698 --> 01:19:49,575
Juicy like you've never tasted before.

1046
01:19:50,201 --> 01:19:53,787
An exquisite taste
with a very affordable price!

1047
01:19:53,871 --> 01:19:58,371
Made fresh from our naturally-grown,
Grade A super pigs.

That's Lucy's autograph.
"Designed by Lucy Mirando."”

Oh! She can't get enough of herself,
can she?

Hey! Oh, how's everyone doing?

1055

Still with this thing.
It looks super tacky.

1056

[in Korean] Don't touch it!

1057
01:20:19,439 --> 01:20:20,481
[in English] Don't touch it.

1058
01:20:20,565 --> 01:20:22,692
[in Korean]
Okay, okay. The fanny pack is fine.

1059
01:20:23,359 --> 01:20:25,235
[in English]
I think she understands some English.

1060
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:26,863
So we should be careful what we say.

1061

Yes, yes, everything is fine.

1062
01:20:29,449 --> 01:20:31,325
But you have to wear this.

1063

Oh, it's a special edition,
custom-made, just for you.

Look. The CEO even autographed it.

Boop! Totally rad, right?

1066
01:20:40,501 --> 01:20:42,002
Wow. Hmm? [giggles]

1067
01:20:42,086 --> 01:20:43,295
Now, let's put it on.

1068
01:20:44,339 --> 01:20:45,715
[in Korean] Not until I see Okja.

1069
01:20:46,299 --> 01:20:49,760
Mija... Oh!
Think about how dramatic it will be.

1070
01:20:49,844 --> 01:20:52,763
Okja— Okja doesn't even know you're here.

1071
01:20:52,847 --> 01:20:56,350
If you show up on stage
without telling her,

1072
01:20:56,434 --> 01:20:58,394
it'll be such a great surprise.

1073
01:20:58,978 --> 01:21:00,437
You know? Surprise?

1074
01:21:00,521 --> 01:21:01,813
[in Korean] I don't care about that.

1075
01:21:01,898 --> 01:21:04,859
I want to see Okja first.
Or I won't cooperate.

-Mija...
-[translator] She said no.

No, no, no.
We are the ones who have Okja. Okay?

1080
01:21:15,870 --> 01:21:18,163
We are doing you a favor.
Do you get it now?

[translator speaking Korean]

1082

Yep, yep, yep.
You want to go back home with Okja, right?

1083
01:21:23,336 --> 01:21:25,004
Then do as you're told.

1084
01:21:25,088 --> 01:21:28,758
Otherwise,
this is what will happen to Okja.

The turnout's looking good,
don't you think?

You frighten people, too, Lucy.

1129

She reminds them of Daddy.

This is mine. This is my project.

[crowd cheering]

1149

Ten years ago,
26 farmers from lands far away

1150
01:27:16,564 --> 01:27:19,775
were each given a magical super piglet.

1151
01:27:20,693 --> 01:27:24,196
This year, I met these wonderful people,

1152
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:27,825
to decide which super piglet
would have the honor of being invited

1153
01:27:27,908 --> 01:27:29,910
to this prestigious occasion.

Are you ready to meet
the winner of this contest?

[all] Yeah!

01:27:37,209 --> 01:27:40,754

on the face of the Earth?

01:27:40,838 --> 01:27:42,422
[all] Yeah!

have to meet somebody else first.

Isn't that the way it always is?

and she happens to be the brain
behind this entire super pig project!

1166
01:28:09,283 --> 01:28:13,245
Ladies and gentlemen,
put your hands together

Oh, Johnny.

You're skating on thin ice.
Watch out you don't fall in and drown.

1175
01:28:47,988 --> 01:28:50,198
Don't worry.
I'm not here to put you to sleep

in that underground mall in Seoul!

So let's all welcome
