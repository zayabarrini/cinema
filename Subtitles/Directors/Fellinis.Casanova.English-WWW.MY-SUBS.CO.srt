1
00:02:57,391 --> 00:03:03,058
Real figure, real nature,
sending out rays like the dawn,

2
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:06,058
making us all fall in love.

3
00:03:06,141 --> 00:03:08,391
Oh, Venice!

4
00:03:09,475 --> 00:03:13,558
- Oh, queen!
- Oh, queen!

5
00:03:17,058 --> 00:03:20,683
Your breath is
the sirocco or bora wind

6
00:03:20,766 --> 00:03:24,558
that awakens the shivers
of eternal life,

7
00:03:24,641 --> 00:03:28,183
golden lady who governs us.

8
00:03:28,433 --> 00:03:30,683
Oh, Venice!

9
00:03:36,725 --> 00:03:40,600
Holy head, stone and diamond,
mouth that speaks,

10
00:03:40,683 --> 00:03:42,891
ear that hears...

11
00:03:42,975 --> 00:03:46,558
Raise that ribbon.
If you are afraid, close your eyes.

12
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:13,641
Oh, how you grow,
oh moon, with deep caves.

13
00:04:13,725 --> 00:04:18,141
Oh, how you rise,
with blue and blond hair...

14
00:04:31,016 --> 00:04:33,391
Rise! Rise!

15
00:04:33,475 --> 00:04:36,933
Put up the irons, put up the poles,
pour wine, bring out the jug for her.

16
00:04:37,016 --> 00:04:39,891
Fill her up with only the best.

17
00:04:39,975 --> 00:04:43,225
She is a drunkard, a glutton!

18
00:04:43,308 --> 00:04:47,558
Who knows what she will donate
to us, after!

19
00:04:48,183 --> 00:04:52,183
Miuna screwer, defecating buttocks,
subterranean old woman,

20
00:04:52,266 --> 00:04:57,433
old smelly woman or big Miuna,
flirter and cheater,

21
00:04:57,516 --> 00:05:03,725
who we are forced to accept as wife
mother, wicked mother- in-law,

22
00:05:03,808 --> 00:05:07,475
sister and grandmother...

23
00:06:02,641 --> 00:06:06,099
A tragedy! A tragedy!

24
00:06:06,183 --> 00:06:09,266
We won't see it anymore!
We won't see it anymore!

25
00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:14,099
We won't see
this damned head anymore!

26
00:07:05,349 --> 00:07:10,766
"A nun who has seen you for
two months at the convent Mass,

27
00:07:10,849 --> 00:07:12,641
wishes to meet you.

28
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:16,641
She will be waiting for you
at San Bartolo island tonight.

29
00:07:16,724 --> 00:07:21,224
Without a servant,
and carrying a candle."

30
00:08:55,766 --> 00:09:01,557
My love, please. Let me take off
those clothes which are so serious.

31
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:05,516
They are ill-suited
for our love encounter.

32
00:09:05,599 --> 00:09:07,641
We must wait.

33
00:09:08,891 --> 00:09:10,349
What?

34
00:09:10,432 --> 00:09:13,516
I do not know if my friend
has already arrived.

35
00:09:14,391 --> 00:09:15,557
Friend?

36
00:09:30,141 --> 00:09:31,557
He is here.

37
00:09:31,641 --> 00:09:33,099
Who?

38
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:37,932
- My lover De Bernis.
- The French ambassador?

39
00:09:39,807 --> 00:09:42,891
That is really something!
It will add a different flavor.

40
00:09:42,974 --> 00:09:45,224
This villa is his.

41
00:09:45,307 --> 00:09:46,974
He will allow us to use it,

42
00:09:47,057 --> 00:09:50,141
but in exchange he wants to watch,
without our seeing him.

43
00:09:50,224 --> 00:09:53,516
Where will this bizarre man stay?

44
00:09:54,349 --> 00:09:56,349
- He is over there.
- Where?

45
00:09:56,432 --> 00:09:59,599
Did you see those little fishes
on the wall?

46
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,349
He is back there.

47
00:10:05,307 --> 00:10:08,349
If you do your duty diligently,
he will not be bored.

48
00:10:08,849 --> 00:10:10,141
Bored?

49
00:10:11,349 --> 00:10:12,682
With me?

50
00:10:13,099 --> 00:10:15,932
- He will be amazed.
- Really?

51
00:10:16,641 --> 00:10:19,057
Never has he seen
your femininity, your grace,

52
00:10:19,141 --> 00:10:23,766
highlighted by such
a well-mannered lover.

53
00:10:25,724 --> 00:10:28,474
Not well-mannered!
It is an offense.

54
00:10:28,557 --> 00:10:33,224
When do two lovers, overtaken
by frenzy, worry about manners?

55
00:10:34,057 --> 00:10:37,391
Then... I will only be delicate.

56
00:10:48,307 --> 00:10:50,891
What is it?
Oh, what a lovely jewel!

57
00:10:52,349 --> 00:10:53,766
Is it gold?

58
00:10:55,557 --> 00:10:57,182
What bird is it?

59
00:10:57,474 --> 00:11:00,266
A dove? Or an owl?

60
00:11:01,807 --> 00:11:03,724
No, no, no.

61
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,849
Stop.

62
00:11:07,057 --> 00:11:08,932
There.

63
00:11:11,932 --> 00:11:15,057
Now you must chase me because
that is what he likes.

64
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:16,391
Alright.

65
00:11:20,266 --> 00:11:23,349
Your lover deserves being a cuckold.

66
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:26,516
And we will apply ourselves to this,
all night long.

67
00:11:51,099 --> 00:11:52,432
Come up.

68
00:12:04,266 --> 00:12:05,474
Very good.

69
00:12:19,099 --> 00:12:20,390
Turn around.

70
00:12:37,932 --> 00:12:40,140
Stop, stop!

71
00:14:26,557 --> 00:14:28,599
No, no, no.

72
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:54,182
Love, love.

73
00:16:12,098 --> 00:16:15,557
Well done, my young man.
Very good.

74
00:16:15,848 --> 00:16:19,140
I would say your performance
was excellent.

75
00:16:19,223 --> 00:16:23,807
I have heard many admirable
things about you.

76
00:16:23,932 --> 00:16:27,057
To be more demanding,

77
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:31,348
when you were on your back,
you could have done better.

78
00:16:31,432 --> 00:16:35,057
There, you lacked a bit in...

79
00:16:35,682 --> 00:16:37,307
imagination.

80
00:16:37,557 --> 00:16:42,807
But on the whole,
the performance was well done.

81
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,932
Bravo!

82
00:16:45,015 --> 00:16:47,098
Mister Ambassador, your approval...

83
00:16:47,182 --> 00:16:48,682
Giacomo.

84
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:54,307
Your approval fills me
with great pride.

85
00:16:55,515 --> 00:17:00,348
However, with your permission,
I want to say that my capacities

86
00:17:00,432 --> 00:17:03,515
go beyond what you have
just been a spectator of.

87
00:17:03,765 --> 00:17:06,390
I studied engineering, literature...

88
00:17:06,473 --> 00:17:08,390
Giacomo.

89
00:17:08,473 --> 00:17:13,598
and I am learned in the art
of politics and economy.

90
00:17:13,765 --> 00:17:17,140
I modestly believe
that some of my discoveries

91
00:17:17,223 --> 00:17:20,890
would be favorably accepted
by the King of France's government.

92
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,098
Besides being a dilettante
in the studies of alchemy,

93
00:17:24,182 --> 00:17:28,515
which almost led me to increase
the volume of mercury,

94
00:17:28,598 --> 00:17:31,265
- I am an expert in divination.
- Take this.

95
00:17:33,182 --> 00:17:36,057
I invented an infallible method

96
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:40,223
to double the profits of a state,
in the brief time span of one year.

97
00:17:40,598 --> 00:17:42,307
If I may dare...

98
00:17:43,682 --> 00:17:45,307
Your cape.

99
00:17:47,307 --> 00:17:50,557
In all humility, I would like
to ask your excellency,

100
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,557
for a letter of presentation.

101
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,473
I am ready to leave immediately
for your wonderful country

102
00:17:56,557 --> 00:17:59,307
which I love and consider
my second homeland.

103
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,140
Good-bye.

104
00:18:33,848 --> 00:18:35,640
Do you care for me?

105
00:19:37,306 --> 00:19:39,431
Giacomo Casanova!

106
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:44,056
Giacomo Casanova!

107
00:19:46,723 --> 00:19:51,890
In the name
of Messer Grande,

108
00:19:51,973 --> 00:19:55,348
the illumined judges
of the Inquisition court,

109
00:19:55,431 --> 00:19:57,598
you are under arrest.

110
00:19:58,181 --> 00:20:01,056
Why? Why?

111
00:20:17,931 --> 00:20:22,556
"Giacomo Casanova, you are guilty
of exercising black magic,

112
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,098
of possessing prohibited evil books,

113
00:20:26,181 --> 00:20:30,056
of being the author of heretic
writings and of criticizing religion.

114
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:33,640
I, Messer Grande, by order
of the Inquisitors of Venice,

115
00:20:33,723 --> 00:20:37,973
declare you under arrest. You will be
put into the Piombi prison.

116
00:20:42,473 --> 00:20:46,098
I respect the illuminated judgement
of the court, Messer Grande,

117
00:20:46,181 --> 00:20:50,223
but I am obliged to repeat that
I declare myself absolutely innocent.

118
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,306
Come.

119
00:21:43,098 --> 00:21:45,140
Listen, listen...

120
00:21:46,556 --> 00:21:51,556
Open! Open! I cannot live
in this horrible cell!

121
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,806
It is an injustice! Open!

122
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:56,806
I am not a heretic. Open!

123
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,556
Open!

124
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:08,681
Why?

125
00:22:27,015 --> 00:22:30,473
My life of freedom
seemed so far away.

126
00:22:31,348 --> 00:22:35,723
The pleasant company,
the love encounters.

127
00:22:38,431 --> 00:22:41,639
Marietta, we need a different
thread here!

128
00:22:43,764 --> 00:22:46,056
He looks a like a mannequin.

129
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:47,806
- Are those things real?
- What?

130
00:22:47,889 --> 00:22:51,348
That silk, those ornaments,
that satin he is wearing.

131
00:22:52,556 --> 00:22:57,973
With a nose such as his,
I wonder what the rest is like!

132
00:22:59,514 --> 00:23:01,639
Tonina, pass me the thread.

133
00:23:11,889 --> 00:23:13,931
Look at what a lovely statue!

134
00:23:14,723 --> 00:23:19,181
The artist should have added
more color.

135
00:23:19,473 --> 00:23:22,514
That girl is a big worry for me.

136
00:23:22,598 --> 00:23:27,306
She does not eat, does not sing, does
not laugh and is always at home!

137
00:23:30,223 --> 00:23:31,098
Here she is!

138
00:23:38,139 --> 00:23:40,889
My lady is outside waiting.

139
00:23:41,556 --> 00:23:44,264
Hurry! Hide!
Slip underneath!

140
00:24:08,473 --> 00:24:10,598
She looks like a peacock!

141
00:24:15,598 --> 00:24:20,139
Come out from under there! Get
to work or it will never get done.

142
00:24:35,973 --> 00:24:38,056
You know he is starting
to act like a madman again?

143
00:24:39,264 --> 00:24:42,348
Again?
I cannot believe it.

144
00:24:42,431 --> 00:24:45,931
I tell you that it is so.
Worse than before.

145
00:24:46,431 --> 00:24:49,223
He is insolent and brazen.

146
00:24:49,306 --> 00:24:51,556
My dear, it is a real martyrdom.

147
00:24:52,389 --> 00:24:55,389
Do you not think we should do
something to repress

148
00:24:55,473 --> 00:24:59,389
who is so disobedient
and rebellious?

149
00:25:00,014 --> 00:25:03,556
But what?
What more can I do?

150
00:25:04,056 --> 00:25:06,014
I try to hide him,

151
00:25:06,098 --> 00:25:10,639
to keep him away from other
people's looks, as much as I can.

152
00:25:11,264 --> 00:25:15,389
But he is so brazen and reckless
and shrewd!

153
00:25:15,473 --> 00:25:18,056
He shamelessly likes to show off.

154
00:25:18,139 --> 00:25:21,764
Wherever he goes, he does anything
to be seen by everyone!

155
00:25:21,848 --> 00:25:25,306
I live in the fear that any moment

156
00:25:25,389 --> 00:25:27,598
he may even speak.

157
00:25:27,681 --> 00:25:31,348
He might make fun of me
to make me look ridiculous.

158
00:25:32,889 --> 00:25:36,014
Yes, he is very pompous
and self- centered.

159
00:25:36,264 --> 00:25:38,681
He looks like a fanatic.

160
00:25:39,098 --> 00:25:43,389
He bloats more and more
every day, right?

161
00:25:43,556 --> 00:25:47,473
That is right, and he
always causes scandal in church!

162
00:25:47,556 --> 00:25:50,223
He distracts the faithful
from thinking of God.

163
00:25:50,306 --> 00:25:54,764
Everyone's eyes go to him!
He is a sacrilegious instrument.

164
00:25:54,848 --> 00:25:57,514
He interrupts prayer,
communication with God!

165
00:25:57,598 --> 00:26:03,848
He fills everyone's eyes
with his fat, round cheeks.

166
00:26:09,223 --> 00:26:11,431
There is nothing left to do.

167
00:26:12,306 --> 00:26:14,597
He absolutely must be punished.

168
00:26:14,681 --> 00:26:17,222
- Yes, he must be whipped.
- Uncover him!

169
00:26:17,306 --> 00:26:19,806
I have waited so long
to hear him scream!

170
00:26:19,889 --> 00:26:23,389
Whip me, mortify my flesh!

171
00:26:23,472 --> 00:26:28,389
Do it! Make him cry!
He is so brazen!

172
00:26:28,472 --> 00:26:30,264
- Have no pity!
- No!

173
00:26:30,347 --> 00:26:34,514
I cannot. I love him too much.
Have pity on him.

174
00:26:34,597 --> 00:26:39,639
He is not wicked. He loves me.
Do you not love me?

175
00:26:39,722 --> 00:26:45,014
He is lovely, he is my best
friend. My sweetheart.

176
00:26:45,097 --> 00:26:51,306
He is lovely! He is lovely!
He is lovely! He is lovely!

177
00:26:52,014 --> 00:26:56,222
Sweetheart, sweetheart.

178
00:26:57,139 --> 00:26:59,222
One, two, three...

179
00:27:03,472 --> 00:27:07,347
No, with me, silly!
Maestro... look at me!

180
00:27:11,181 --> 00:27:13,139
My respects, Sir.

181
00:27:24,472 --> 00:27:26,514
Your servant, Master.

182
00:27:29,806 --> 00:27:31,639
Very good.

183
00:27:39,764 --> 00:27:41,681
She looks like a broom.

184
00:27:47,847 --> 00:27:50,097
Turn.

185
00:28:09,681 --> 00:28:13,097
- What is the matter?
- Annamaria is sick again.

186
00:28:15,097 --> 00:28:18,847
Poor girl.
Three or four times a day.

187
00:28:18,931 --> 00:28:22,056
- Shall I call a doctor?
- Run. Have him come immediately!

188
00:28:22,139 --> 00:28:25,722
Thank you for your trouble.

189
00:28:27,389 --> 00:28:30,556
- The doctor is coming!
- The doctor!

190
00:28:37,681 --> 00:28:39,014
Bleeding.

191
00:28:39,514 --> 00:28:40,931
Bleeding?

192
00:28:45,472 --> 00:28:47,514
Give it to me.

193
00:28:49,972 --> 00:28:52,931
Look, Holy Mother!

194
00:28:53,014 --> 00:28:55,139
I cannot look at it.

195
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:14,181
What can I do if I am in love
with you, Annamaria?

196
00:29:14,431 --> 00:29:17,681
Your spiritual beauty attracts
the artist that is inside of me.

197
00:29:17,764 --> 00:29:20,847
I would like to model you
like a wax statue,

198
00:29:20,931 --> 00:29:23,431
like the statue
I thought you were.

199
00:29:23,514 --> 00:29:27,556
I would be your pygmalion, I would
give vital breath to my creature

200
00:29:27,639 --> 00:29:30,431
and would give you my life
with my own blood.

201
00:29:30,514 --> 00:29:33,889
My own fire would burn
inside of you.

202
00:30:31,889 --> 00:30:34,180
What are you doing here?

203
00:30:35,347 --> 00:30:39,555
- I am breathing the sea air.
- In the dark, and all alone?

204
00:30:41,805 --> 00:30:45,472
It is the best hour. After which,
the mosquitoes begin to bite.

205
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:58,555
Do you know that you frightened me?

206
00:30:59,222 --> 00:31:01,514
You are so pale!

207
00:31:01,639 --> 00:31:03,389
Do you know these verses?

208
00:31:03,472 --> 00:31:08,097
"The moon itself
was incarnated inside of her."

209
00:31:10,014 --> 00:31:12,014
What is it?

210
00:31:12,097 --> 00:31:15,097
The figure-head of a ship
which sunk.

211
00:31:15,222 --> 00:31:19,389
The sea dragged it here.
Think of those poor people!

212
00:31:20,472 --> 00:31:22,472
Deep down there...

213
00:31:24,847 --> 00:31:27,472
People of the house!
Annamaria fainted. Hurry!

214
00:31:27,555 --> 00:31:29,472
The doctor, please.

215
00:31:43,097 --> 00:31:46,305
Annamaria, love.

216
00:31:56,347 --> 00:31:58,430
Doctor, she is here.

217
00:31:59,472 --> 00:32:02,972
Why does this always happen
to the poor girl?

218
00:32:03,805 --> 00:32:07,055
- What can we do, Doctor?
- Bleeding.

219
00:32:21,555 --> 00:32:23,680
What is her disease?

220
00:34:13,972 --> 00:34:18,638
My escape from the Piombi prison
was an artwork of intelligence.

221
00:34:18,847 --> 00:34:22,597
The calculation was exact,
together with intuition and courage.

222
00:34:23,097 --> 00:34:26,055
These qualities were all
blessed by good fortune.

223
00:34:42,388 --> 00:34:45,597
I had never seen Venice
from so far above.

224
00:34:45,847 --> 00:34:47,555
I could barely recognize it.

225
00:34:47,638 --> 00:34:52,138
My beloved city,
which I had to abandon forever.

226
00:35:15,888 --> 00:35:20,930
In Paris, the Marquise D'Ufre's salon
was the one most sought after,

227
00:35:21,013 --> 00:35:24,263
by every outstanding person
of art and culture.

228
00:35:24,347 --> 00:35:26,930
I had the honor of being
invited there.

229
00:35:27,013 --> 00:35:30,472
Among others,
I met Count Saint- Germain,

230
00:35:30,555 --> 00:35:34,763
a magician who practiced occultism,
who I considered without scruples.

231
00:35:35,388 --> 00:35:37,388
He boasted being 300 years old,

232
00:35:37,472 --> 00:35:41,472
thanks to some
of his alchemy secrets.

233
00:35:41,555 --> 00:35:44,472
I had a discussion with him,
in which I was victorious.

234
00:35:45,972 --> 00:35:49,180
The famous Marquise D'Ufre',

235
00:35:49,263 --> 00:35:51,013
an extraordinary
and fascinating woman,

236
00:35:51,097 --> 00:35:54,722
adored being surrounded by magicians,
people with exceptional perception.

237
00:35:54,805 --> 00:35:58,180
She, herself, was an expert
in necromancy.

238
00:36:05,138 --> 00:36:09,347
I am in contact
with the Queen of Saba.

239
00:36:09,513 --> 00:36:14,138
Oh, how kind!
She has returned to us.

240
00:36:14,597 --> 00:36:17,930
What is the water that does not
come from the rocks,

241
00:36:18,013 --> 00:36:20,888
that does not fall from the sky,

242
00:36:20,972 --> 00:36:26,305
that does not come from the earth?
Answer, the sweat of a horse.

243
00:36:26,388 --> 00:36:31,013
They are the enigmas of Salomon.
That is his answer to the queen.

244
00:36:34,597 --> 00:36:38,555
We received the message.
Thank you.

245
00:36:42,596 --> 00:36:46,513
If you really believe
in these extra- human contacts,

246
00:36:46,596 --> 00:36:50,430
why do you not move inside the soul
of the Queen of Saba?

247
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:53,346
She has soul deficiency,
as all women do.

248
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:59,013
The Council of Trento gave judgement
on this nonsense.

249
00:36:59,096 --> 00:37:03,971
Women possess only two soul
qualities. Men have three.

250
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:07,596
Women lack the noble soul,
the immortal one.

251
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:16,680
But for a real woman,
even one soul is more than enough,

252
00:37:16,763 --> 00:37:20,305
as long as it blends in with that
of a man, in perfect harmony,

253
00:37:20,388 --> 00:37:23,305
with the fusion of their bodies.

254
00:37:32,846 --> 00:37:37,638
What do you want, Marquese?
Oh, yes. I understand.

255
00:37:42,471 --> 00:37:46,555
She want us to hear the opinion
of her young niece, Edvige,

256
00:37:46,638 --> 00:37:49,013
who is very learned in theology.

257
00:37:50,096 --> 00:37:53,971
What were you studying this morning,
my child?

258
00:37:54,055 --> 00:37:58,596
I was reading Saint Augustine,
which I found absurd.

259
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:02,180
I think I can disprove
some of his statements.

260
00:38:02,263 --> 00:38:05,055
Which of his statements
did you disprove?

261
00:38:05,138 --> 00:38:08,221
His theory on the mother
of the Savior.

262
00:38:08,305 --> 00:38:13,846
Saint Augustine sustains that Mary
conceived Jesus through her ears.

263
00:38:14,096 --> 00:38:19,013
- Do you doubt it?
- Yes, for three reasons.

264
00:38:19,346 --> 00:38:23,180
First: because God, since He is not
material substance,

265
00:38:23,263 --> 00:38:29,471
needs no hole through which
to enter or exit.

266
00:38:30,055 --> 00:38:34,513
Second: the hearing tubes do not
communicate with maternal alveolus.

267
00:38:34,596 --> 00:38:38,846
Third: if the Virgin Mary
had conceived through her ears,

268
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:42,430
she should have given birth
through her ears, right?

269
00:38:42,513 --> 00:38:45,930
But in this case... Excuse me...

270
00:38:46,013 --> 00:38:48,680
In this case,
the Catholics are right

271
00:38:48,763 --> 00:38:54,721
in considering the Virgin,
a virgin before she conceived.

272
00:39:49,805 --> 00:39:55,638
Here is my refuge, my secret church,
my interior dwelling.

273
00:39:56,971 --> 00:39:59,846
My magic laboratory.

274
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:05,471
Everything you see,
comes from an antique period.

275
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:10,346
And it arrived here... mysteriously.

276
00:40:10,763 --> 00:40:15,763
Did you recognize it?
It was from the divine Paracelsus.

277
00:40:15,846 --> 00:40:20,513
This liquid has been boiling
for 15 years,

278
00:40:20,596 --> 00:40:24,929
and will have to boil
for another five.

279
00:40:29,888 --> 00:40:32,138
Tell the truth.

280
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:36,679
You possess the secret
of the philosopher's stone, right?

281
00:40:38,054 --> 00:40:40,013
No. No, madam.

282
00:40:40,096 --> 00:40:42,554
What makes you think that?

283
00:40:44,221 --> 00:40:46,971
My dear friend

284
00:40:48,054 --> 00:40:50,388
you can trust me.

285
00:40:50,471 --> 00:40:54,054
I know you have the famous stone

286
00:40:54,138 --> 00:40:59,304
and also the capacity to communicate
with the spirits of the 4 elements.

287
00:40:59,388 --> 00:41:04,763
You could overthrow
the King of France at any time.

288
00:41:04,846 --> 00:41:07,929
I would never dare.
I love France.

289
00:41:08,304 --> 00:41:10,513
You over-estimate me, my friend.

290
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:16,554
Giacomo, I beg you,

291
00:41:16,638 --> 00:41:19,179
help me in the great work.

292
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:24,096
The great work?
What do you mean?

293
00:41:25,263 --> 00:41:28,388
Please, you know what it is about.

294
00:41:28,596 --> 00:41:30,221
Speak.

295
00:41:34,429 --> 00:41:36,888
I have to die,

296
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:40,804
and at the moment of my death

297
00:41:40,929 --> 00:41:44,013
I will be transformed into a man...

298
00:41:44,388 --> 00:41:48,554
A man who will live in eternity!

299
00:41:48,638 --> 00:41:52,804
But this is possible
only if I am fecundated

300
00:41:52,888 --> 00:41:56,221
by an initiate
of my same pyramidal sign.

301
00:41:58,471 --> 00:42:04,013
At the moment of birth, my soul
will enter in the newborn's body

302
00:42:04,721 --> 00:42:08,679
and I will no longer exist
as a woman,

303
00:42:08,763 --> 00:42:11,929
but will go back to living
as a man.

304
00:42:12,013 --> 00:42:16,179
A man who will live forever!

305
00:42:18,054 --> 00:42:21,596
You, without a doubt,

306
00:42:21,679 --> 00:42:26,763
are the man who was sent to me
to help me carry out

307
00:42:28,513 --> 00:42:32,138
this great work.

308
00:42:35,221 --> 00:42:39,429
My dear friend, why are you crying?

309
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:41,804
It is nothing.

310
00:42:44,304 --> 00:42:49,013
Nothing, really.
Show me your other treasures.

311
00:42:51,429 --> 00:42:53,388
Please, Madam.

312
00:43:11,471 --> 00:43:13,513
All this will be yours

313
00:43:13,596 --> 00:43:17,429
when together we will have created
the great work.

314
00:43:18,013 --> 00:43:20,054
Oh, no!

315
00:43:20,638 --> 00:43:26,971
I did not mean material treasures,
but spiritual ones.

316
00:43:28,263 --> 00:43:32,138
The treasures of your
ultra-terrestrial knowledge.

317
00:43:42,762 --> 00:43:45,221
My dear Giacomo,

318
00:43:45,512 --> 00:43:50,679
the divine Anael has already painted
your portrait in a dream for me.

319
00:43:50,762 --> 00:43:52,804
And I knew...

320
00:43:53,804 --> 00:43:55,221
Be silent.

321
00:44:05,596 --> 00:44:07,471
I am in Paris!

322
00:44:09,137 --> 00:44:11,762
You are in Paris!

323
00:44:13,221 --> 00:44:17,512
Beautiful Paris,
the city of the Mazzarinos,

324
00:44:17,596 --> 00:44:22,012
the Racines, the Voltaires!
Paris!

325
00:44:23,471 --> 00:44:29,596
My young and greedy heart
sings a voluptuous hymn of glory!

326
00:44:41,096 --> 00:44:44,804
The sudden overturning of
the carriage which frightened me,

327
00:44:44,887 --> 00:44:47,262
was maybe a help from destiny.

328
00:44:47,387 --> 00:44:50,387
In fact, he who had almost ended up
under the wheels,

329
00:44:50,471 --> 00:44:53,596
was non-the-less
than my abbey brother,

330
00:44:53,679 --> 00:44:56,804
who some time ago
left Venice and his priest's cassock

331
00:44:56,887 --> 00:44:59,012
to lead a decadent life in Paris,

332
00:44:59,096 --> 00:45:01,512
together with a young red haired
woman from Treviso,

333
00:45:01,596 --> 00:45:04,387
who had incautiously given in
to his flattery.

334
00:45:14,846 --> 00:45:17,679
I eliminated that dirty liar
with a few coins

335
00:45:17,762 --> 00:45:21,429
and brought with me the girl, who,
besides being attractive and witty,

336
00:45:21,512 --> 00:45:25,762
would have been the ideal person
in my plan for the Marquise.

337
00:45:25,971 --> 00:45:28,512
I planned on talking to her
about it.

338
00:46:02,679 --> 00:46:04,054
Selene.

339
00:46:04,137 --> 00:46:05,929
Anubis.

340
00:46:06,012 --> 00:46:08,054
Osiris.

341
00:46:15,971 --> 00:46:19,054
Let us go beyond
the pleasures of the flesh.

342
00:46:19,137 --> 00:46:23,512
Let us concentrate on melting
our souls together in perfect unison.

343
00:46:23,596 --> 00:46:25,804
Scent of Venus!

344
00:46:25,887 --> 00:46:27,971
Love is the source
and root of life.

345
00:46:28,054 --> 00:46:31,596
Love generates both good and bad
impulses and passions.

346
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:35,554
Love generates the eternal flame,
both divine as well as human.

347
00:46:35,637 --> 00:46:39,137
Love generates gods and demons.

348
00:46:42,137 --> 00:46:44,137
Take her in your arms.

349
00:46:44,262 --> 00:46:46,304
Come, madam.

350
00:46:51,221 --> 00:46:53,137
Come closer.

351
00:46:53,679 --> 00:46:55,846
Scent of Venus.

352
00:47:32,054 --> 00:47:35,595
Giacomo, the hour of Venus has come.

353
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:39,804
I am yours.
May the great work be accomplished.

354
00:47:39,887 --> 00:47:41,512
Wait.

355
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:44,512
I must first complete
my calculations.

356
00:47:49,179 --> 00:47:52,095
I think we are still
in the hour of Mars.

357
00:47:55,470 --> 00:47:57,512
Marcolina.

358
00:48:01,262 --> 00:48:02,887
Come here.

359
00:48:04,679 --> 00:48:07,762
Turn around. I cannot do it.
Bend over.

360
00:48:08,637 --> 00:48:11,554
Never does a man fall
into the deep abyss

361
00:48:11,637 --> 00:48:14,012
and then with equal violence
is thrown up

362
00:48:15,387 --> 00:48:18,429
towards he who is perfection,

363
00:48:18,512 --> 00:48:21,595
like that diaphanous instant

364
00:48:21,679 --> 00:48:24,429
in which the essence of his virility
reaches and touches

365
00:48:24,512 --> 00:48:26,429
the root of the opposite sex.

366
00:48:26,512 --> 00:48:28,304
There, there!

367
00:48:40,012 --> 00:48:41,929
Now silence.

368
00:48:42,387 --> 00:48:44,345
Silence.

369
00:48:56,554 --> 00:48:59,054
- Love.
- Yes.

370
00:49:26,387 --> 00:49:28,012
Marcolina.

371
00:49:29,595 --> 00:49:30,804
Move.

372
00:49:35,095 --> 00:49:36,720
Closer. Come!

373
00:49:37,887 --> 00:49:39,429
Uncover it.

374
00:50:11,345 --> 00:50:14,304
I can do it. I can do it!

375
00:50:17,679 --> 00:50:20,304
I will pierce you!
I will open you up!

376
00:50:21,345 --> 00:50:23,804
I can do it!
Good boy!

377
00:50:40,762 --> 00:50:44,053
Sirs! Sirs!

378
00:50:44,262 --> 00:50:45,720
Two years later, in Forli',

379
00:50:45,803 --> 00:50:49,970
I was to meet the greatest
love of my life.

380
00:50:50,387 --> 00:50:52,803
Requested by some policemen,
I had gotten myself

381
00:50:52,887 --> 00:50:56,012
into a furious brawl
which started in an inn.

382
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:59,970
The man in the adjacent room
had been accused by the Pope's guards

383
00:51:00,053 --> 00:51:03,262
of having let a woman in,
dressed as a man.

384
00:51:05,803 --> 00:51:09,428
Put down that sword
or I will be forced to fire!

385
00:51:09,512 --> 00:51:13,262
The host declares that last night
he asked for a lodging

386
00:51:13,345 --> 00:51:18,178
with a young officer who this
morning he discovered was a woman.

387
00:51:18,262 --> 00:51:21,762
He has been screaming like a madman
and slaps that document in our face.

388
00:51:21,845 --> 00:51:23,095
Do you understand
what is written in it?

389
00:51:23,178 --> 00:51:25,512
This gentleman is Hungarian.

390
00:51:25,595 --> 00:51:29,137
He is a Hungarian officer,
so you are committing a violation.

391
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:31,678
We were called by the host!

392
00:51:31,762 --> 00:51:35,720
Yes. I don't want to go to jail. You
cannot joke with the Holy Father!

393
00:51:35,803 --> 00:51:37,845
Enough!

394
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:40,678
- Bring the coffee!
- It is a scandal!

395
00:52:06,928 --> 00:52:09,095
I am French.

396
00:52:10,345 --> 00:52:11,803
My name is Henriette.

397
00:52:13,095 --> 00:52:15,303
What language do you speak
with your lover?

398
00:52:15,387 --> 00:52:18,595
We do not speak.
It has no use in what we do.

399
00:52:25,387 --> 00:52:27,970
Whoever takes a journey to Parma

400
00:52:28,053 --> 00:52:31,303
must be prepared to know at least
three divinities:

401
00:52:31,387 --> 00:52:33,345
salami, ham

402
00:52:33,428 --> 00:52:37,095
and the famous third one...
Parmesan cheese.

403
00:52:40,053 --> 00:52:42,762
I asked myself who
this young lady was.

404
00:52:43,262 --> 00:52:45,303
What is her relationship
with this Hungarian

405
00:52:45,387 --> 00:52:47,595
who could be her father?

406
00:52:48,262 --> 00:52:50,345
Does she have a husband in Parma?

407
00:52:50,678 --> 00:52:56,262
Or in her libertine frenzy, does she
look for other lovers and pleasures?

408
00:53:11,387 --> 00:53:14,553
The captain seemed to have read
my thoughts.

409
00:53:14,637 --> 00:53:16,428
In his bad grammar Latin,
he told me

410
00:53:16,512 --> 00:53:20,553
that even he knew nothing about
this lovely and mysterious lady.

411
00:53:20,637 --> 00:53:23,178
She had turned to him,
asking for protection

412
00:53:23,262 --> 00:53:26,345
as if she feared something
or someone.

413
00:53:26,803 --> 00:53:30,928
But now he had to leave her,
having to go up north.

414
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:33,428
I could have taken care of her.

415
00:53:52,178 --> 00:53:53,803
Why do you look at me like that?

416
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:58,220
You do not recognize me anymore?

417
00:53:58,762 --> 00:54:02,720
I feel unimportant next to you.
I cannot call you by your first name.

418
00:54:02,928 --> 00:54:07,262
You are no longer the brave
and bizarre officer I knew.

419
00:54:17,178 --> 00:54:20,886
I will always remain the same girl.

420
00:54:21,553 --> 00:54:25,053
She who had three moments of madness
in her life.

421
00:54:25,136 --> 00:54:31,220
And the last, wonderful madness
was knowing you.

422
00:54:41,095 --> 00:54:44,553
We were invited to a concert
at the hunchback Du Bois' home.

423
00:54:44,636 --> 00:54:48,595
He was an eccentric gentleman
with uncertain amorous boundaries,

424
00:54:48,678 --> 00:54:50,595
just as uncertain were
the boundaries of the Parma dukedom,

425
00:54:50,678 --> 00:54:53,136
divided between the Spanish
and the French.

426
00:54:53,845 --> 00:54:56,928
That evening, two civilizations,
two opposite conceptions of life,

427
00:54:57,011 --> 00:54:59,261
faced each other.

428
00:54:59,345 --> 00:55:02,970
An antique proverb says,

429
00:55:03,053 --> 00:55:05,720
"What is lighter than a feather?

430
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:08,803
Ashes.

431
00:55:08,886 --> 00:55:11,345
And what is lighter than ashes?

432
00:55:12,553 --> 00:55:14,136
The wind.

433
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:15,803
And lighter than the wind?

434
00:55:15,886 --> 00:55:17,511
Woman.

435
00:55:17,595 --> 00:55:19,553
And lighter than woman?

436
00:55:19,636 --> 00:55:21,303
Nothing."

437
00:55:21,386 --> 00:55:24,845
We exercise much power over women,
much tyranny,

438
00:55:24,928 --> 00:55:28,386
and we made them accept it
only because

439
00:55:28,470 --> 00:55:31,011
they are kinder,

440
00:55:31,095 --> 00:55:33,428
more reasonable,

441
00:55:33,511 --> 00:55:35,470
more generous than man.

442
00:55:35,553 --> 00:55:39,470
Such qualities which should have made
them superior to us,

443
00:55:39,553 --> 00:55:42,220
instead, put them at our mercy,

444
00:55:42,303 --> 00:55:46,595
because men, in fact, are a hundred
times more unreasonable,

445
00:55:46,678 --> 00:55:48,553
more cruel, violent.

446
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:51,595
They are more inclined
by nature, to oppress.

447
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:56,178
Women's kisses are like a glass
of wine.

448
00:55:56,261 --> 00:55:59,761
You drink and drink,
and drink... and then succumb.

449
00:55:59,845 --> 00:56:04,553
He who never speaks badly of women,
does not love them.

450
00:56:05,386 --> 00:56:11,428
Because to understand them and love
them, you must suffer for them.

451
00:56:11,511 --> 00:56:14,386
So then, and only then,

452
00:56:15,345 --> 00:56:18,136
can you find happiness
on the lips of your beloved.

453
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:23,220
A kiss is just the desire
of devouring what you kiss.

454
00:56:24,345 --> 00:56:28,678
I really think that Du Bois
has that sort of appetite!

455
00:56:30,178 --> 00:56:32,011
What is a kiss?

456
00:56:32,636 --> 00:56:36,261
Simply the desire to get lost

457
00:56:36,345 --> 00:56:38,345
in the soul of the woman you love.

458
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:05,720
We are beginning!

459
00:57:05,803 --> 00:57:09,720
Silence. You will see
a lovely performance.

460
00:58:24,178 --> 00:58:27,303
He himself embroidered
his costume.

461
01:00:19,636 --> 01:00:22,053
It is all metaphoric.

462
01:02:08,344 --> 01:02:10,344
The boy is good too!

463
01:02:10,427 --> 01:02:13,261
- He is very handsome!
- Bravo!

464
01:02:20,052 --> 01:02:23,677
He was extraordinary. Do you not
agree? You loved him, right?

465
01:02:23,761 --> 01:02:29,844
The music made me cry,
but I did not understand the story.

466
01:02:31,886 --> 01:02:34,844
I do not deserve so much applause.

467
01:02:34,927 --> 01:02:38,677
I wrote this work
for Giambruno.

468
01:02:38,761 --> 01:02:42,052
Thank you, Giambruno.

469
01:02:42,719 --> 01:02:43,969
- Bravo.
- Thank you.

470
01:02:44,052 --> 01:02:47,261
My sincere compliments
for the virtuoso singer

471
01:02:47,344 --> 01:02:50,219
and the mime instructor.
Amazing.

472
01:02:50,427 --> 01:02:53,636
But after the topics discussed
at the table,

473
01:02:53,719 --> 01:02:57,261
you will not be surprised
of my absolute disapproval

474
01:02:57,344 --> 01:03:01,219
of the idea behind
your captivating ballet.

475
01:03:59,677 --> 01:04:02,761
Who is this Enrichetta?

476
01:04:03,386 --> 01:04:08,011
Who is this priceless treasure
of which I have become owner?

477
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:10,594
Is it really possible?

478
01:04:10,927 --> 01:04:13,927
Oh, stars! You tell me!

479
01:04:14,511 --> 01:04:17,011
Cry it out from the depth
of your sky,

480
01:04:17,094 --> 01:04:20,511
that the happy mortal
to which this creature belongs to,

481
01:04:20,594 --> 01:04:22,469
is Giacomo Casanova. Only him!

482
01:04:23,552 --> 01:04:26,511
Mister Casanova,
what is the matter?

483
01:04:27,302 --> 01:04:31,761
My friend, I am afraid.
I am afraid of my happiness.

484
01:04:31,844 --> 01:04:33,552
- Yes?
- Enrichetta...

485
01:04:33,636 --> 01:04:38,260
She is an extraordinary woman,
with an extraordinary destiny.

486
01:04:38,344 --> 01:04:42,052
- However, I am tempted...
- Forgive me, gentlemen.

487
01:04:43,927 --> 01:04:46,010
Mister D'Antoine.

488
01:04:46,135 --> 01:04:51,594
- Wonderful!
- A real concert player!

489
01:04:51,677 --> 01:04:55,510
- Where did you learn so well?
- In the convent.

490
01:04:55,969 --> 01:04:58,344
But if it was not for a precise
order from the bishop,

491
01:04:58,427 --> 01:05:01,844
the abbess would never have given
me permission to play.

492
01:05:01,927 --> 01:05:05,302
That pious wife of Christ, said that
when I played the violoncello

493
01:05:05,385 --> 01:05:08,094
I always had an indecent pose.

494
01:05:08,885 --> 01:05:13,135
Mademoiselle, I apologize
for being so late.

495
01:05:13,802 --> 01:05:15,844
The trip is long.

496
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:38,802
Always, always with you,
my sweet Enrichetta.

497
01:05:39,427 --> 01:05:44,052
Cruel Enrichetta,
how many things you hide from me.

498
01:05:44,135 --> 01:05:48,177
Your past, your virtues,
your talents.

499
01:05:48,260 --> 01:05:50,594
When I heard you play
the violoncello,

500
01:05:50,677 --> 01:05:53,760
you almost made me die.

501
01:05:56,344 --> 01:05:58,177
Enrichetta.

502
01:05:59,927 --> 01:06:01,552
Love.

503
01:06:18,052 --> 01:06:19,927
Love.

504
01:06:27,010 --> 01:06:29,052
Forever.

505
01:07:02,594 --> 01:07:05,552
- Mister Du Bois.
- Good morning.

506
01:07:08,969 --> 01:07:13,094
I am sorry to have intruded
into your apartment,

507
01:07:13,177 --> 01:07:17,719
but the servants let me in
without announcing me.

508
01:07:19,177 --> 01:07:22,719
I accept your apologies, but what do
I owe the honor of this visit to?

509
01:07:24,135 --> 01:07:28,010
As you noticed, Miss Enrichetta
is no longer here.

510
01:07:28,927 --> 01:07:30,885
Where did she go?
What happened to her?

511
01:07:31,719 --> 01:07:37,052
Nothing. My dear friend,
she is better off than you or me.

512
01:07:37,135 --> 01:07:43,552
But sudden important obligations
forced her

513
01:07:43,635 --> 01:07:46,135
to leave before dawn.

514
01:07:46,219 --> 01:07:47,927
I only caught a glimpse of her

515
01:07:48,010 --> 01:07:51,302
while she was climbing
into Mister D'Antoine's carriage.

516
01:07:51,385 --> 01:07:56,510
In this circumstance,
she begged me to come advise you.

517
01:07:56,594 --> 01:08:02,177
Or better yet, advise you not to do
anything to find her.

518
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:05,094
Why did she have to leave?
Who is D'Antoine?

519
01:08:05,177 --> 01:08:09,385
Do not be agitated.
I cannot tell you anything else,

520
01:08:09,468 --> 01:08:13,218
except that the mysterious Enrichetta
is no longer available.

521
01:08:13,302 --> 01:08:17,468
An important person,
from a European court,

522
01:08:17,552 --> 01:08:20,552
has full power over her.

523
01:08:20,635 --> 01:08:25,885
D'Antoine is the emissary who came
to take her to her right place.

524
01:08:25,968 --> 01:08:28,010
Her place is with me.
I will find her.

525
01:08:28,093 --> 01:08:32,260
I will not lose her, if I have
to face the armies of all of Europe.

526
01:08:35,052 --> 01:08:37,343
Where did she go?

527
01:08:37,427 --> 01:08:41,635
- Where is she headed?
- Towards the Alps, naturally.

528
01:08:42,260 --> 01:08:44,260
I will leave immediately.

529
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:49,218
I must find her at all costs.

530
01:08:50,593 --> 01:08:53,260
She is my sole, only love.

531
01:08:56,093 --> 01:08:58,843
Mister Casanova!

532
01:09:00,968 --> 01:09:03,010
I beg you!

533
01:09:04,927 --> 01:09:08,677
In my super-human pain
I was anxious to kill myself.

534
01:09:10,135 --> 01:09:12,343
Or bury myself in a cloister.

535
01:09:12,427 --> 01:09:14,468
A monk forever.

536
01:09:17,218 --> 01:09:20,218
I did not choose death,
nor to become a monk.

537
01:09:20,677 --> 01:09:25,552
Death, the great friend of generous
and unfortunate spirits.

538
01:09:28,135 --> 01:09:31,802
Many years later, in London,
I tried the extreme step.

539
01:09:31,885 --> 01:09:34,302
Guilty of such unhealthy temptation,

540
01:09:34,385 --> 01:09:38,635
was the infamous Charpillon,
and her daughter.

541
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:45,343
Thief! There were 200 sequins,
the corsets and the silver mirror!

542
01:09:45,427 --> 01:09:48,552
I will not tolerate this insinuation.

543
01:09:48,635 --> 01:09:50,427
Take your hands off of me,
you whore!

544
01:09:50,510 --> 01:09:56,093
Me, whore? I did not have the chance
of being one with you, impotent!

545
01:09:58,052 --> 01:10:02,968
Exploiter! Damned the day
I accepted you in my home!

546
01:10:03,052 --> 01:10:06,593
You and your lies on the stars,
on horoscopes!

547
01:10:06,843 --> 01:10:08,885
You and your daughter
are truly damned.

548
01:10:08,968 --> 01:10:12,468
You contaminated what was most dear
to me... My health!

549
01:10:12,552 --> 01:10:14,885
Filthy syphilis carriers,
thieves, leaches!

550
01:10:14,968 --> 01:10:18,010
Because of you, I am ruined.
All of London laughs behind my back.

551
01:10:18,093 --> 01:10:24,968
You, with that rotten worm between
your legs, infected me!

552
01:10:25,052 --> 01:10:28,968
- Enough! Coachman, stop!
- Coachman!

553
01:10:29,052 --> 01:10:33,760
Let me off, or I'll stab you
with my sword, witches!

554
01:10:33,843 --> 01:10:37,135
We are going to the police station!

555
01:10:37,218 --> 01:10:39,802
You will repeat your accusations
to them!

556
01:10:39,885 --> 01:10:43,593
Go to hell, you and
your miserable daughter!

557
01:10:43,677 --> 01:10:46,802
Do not touch those bags!
Coachman, leave immediately!

558
01:10:46,885 --> 01:10:49,927
Whip those horses if you do not want
Lord Winston to whip you!

559
01:10:50,010 --> 01:10:51,635
Whore!

560
01:10:51,802 --> 01:10:53,760
- Thief!
- Leave me alone!

561
01:10:53,843 --> 01:10:57,760
My bag!
Mother, I have it!

562
01:10:57,927 --> 01:11:01,010
Mother, do something!
Mother!

563
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:05,927
Cowardly bastard.

564
01:11:08,260 --> 01:11:10,427
If you take one step,
I will kill you.

565
01:11:12,135 --> 01:11:15,052
- Damned witches.
- Quick, open!

566
01:11:16,635 --> 01:11:18,677
May you end your days

567
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:21,927
in the filthiest brothels
of Turkey.

568
01:11:24,427 --> 01:11:26,968
May you be locked up
in the most miserable prisons.

569
01:11:27,052 --> 01:11:28,468
Leave!

570
01:11:29,968 --> 01:11:33,968
Disgusting bitches!
Damned whores!

571
01:11:34,052 --> 01:11:36,302
You dishonor the name of all women!

572
01:11:38,093 --> 01:11:39,551
Away!

573
01:12:00,135 --> 01:12:02,176
Why?

574
01:12:06,801 --> 01:12:10,593
You two witches mortified me,
robbed me,

575
01:12:10,676 --> 01:12:12,926
destroyed me... Why?

576
01:12:16,218 --> 01:12:17,843
Giacomo,

577
01:12:19,468 --> 01:12:24,635
is it possible that your star
has reached the hour of dawn?

578
01:12:25,051 --> 01:12:27,801
You put up with vile insults,

579
01:12:28,343 --> 01:12:30,760
you underwent the worst
humiliation of your life.

580
01:12:30,843 --> 01:12:33,176
For the first time,

581
01:12:36,051 --> 01:12:39,718
your senses did not correspond
to your desire.

582
01:12:45,468 --> 01:12:48,468
Eros has abandoned you.

583
01:12:48,885 --> 01:12:52,510
And dark death arises
in front of you.

584
01:13:05,010 --> 01:13:07,510
So, if destiny decides,

585
01:13:12,676 --> 01:13:14,301
that I

586
01:13:15,093 --> 01:13:18,968
am to face the moment of death,

587
01:13:23,218 --> 01:13:25,218
I shall do so as best suits me.

588
01:13:27,135 --> 01:13:29,843
I will go dressed
with my best attire,

589
01:13:31,093 --> 01:13:33,135
the one I wear for festivities.

590
01:13:33,718 --> 01:13:35,718
Soon I shall be ready

591
01:13:37,093 --> 01:13:39,426
to enter into the antique courts

592
01:13:41,926 --> 01:13:43,968
of antique men.

593
01:13:45,468 --> 01:13:48,760
In the peace of Limbo,

594
01:13:50,051 --> 01:13:52,093
they will welcome me.

595
01:13:54,260 --> 01:13:57,135
I will meet Horace, Dante,

596
01:13:58,551 --> 01:14:01,051
I will converse with Petrarch,

597
01:14:02,968 --> 01:14:05,010
with Ariosto,

598
01:14:06,426 --> 01:14:10,051
and with you, Torquato Tasso.

599
01:14:10,135 --> 01:14:13,635
My tender friend whose verses
come to my mind

600
01:14:13,718 --> 01:14:15,718
in this supreme moment.

601
01:15:57,676 --> 01:15:59,718
Where are you?

602
01:16:04,509 --> 01:16:06,551
Where are you?

603
01:17:12,926 --> 01:17:18,468
The great Mouna!
The queen of whales!

604
01:17:18,551 --> 01:17:22,051
Everyone can enter.
The stomach is still warm.

605
01:17:22,218 --> 01:17:25,843
A female whale. Look at its
mouth, inviting you to go inside.

606
01:17:25,926 --> 01:17:26,843
Are you afraid?

607
01:17:26,926 --> 01:17:30,718
He who does not enter into its
stomach will not find the treasure.

608
01:17:30,801 --> 01:17:33,968
So says the antique book of wisdom.

609
01:17:34,051 --> 01:17:38,843
Come and you will see inside
its throat and farther down,

610
01:17:38,926 --> 01:17:42,134
in the stomach
of the great Mouna...

611
01:17:45,259 --> 01:17:49,426
The Mouna is a door
that leads who knows where,

612
01:17:49,509 --> 01:17:51,843
a wall that must be knocked down.

613
01:17:58,293 --> 01:18:02,001
The Mouna is a spider-web,
a silk funnel.

614
01:18:02,085 --> 01:18:04,501
The heart of all flowers.

615
01:18:08,126 --> 01:18:12,793
The Mouna is a white mountain
of sugar,

616
01:18:13,001 --> 01:18:16,460
a forest where wolves pass by.

617
01:18:16,543 --> 01:18:19,460
It is the carriage
that pulls horses.

618
01:18:30,418 --> 01:18:35,501
The Mouna is an empty whale,
full of air and black with fireflies,

619
01:18:35,626 --> 01:18:37,960
an oven that burns everything.

620
01:18:44,085 --> 01:18:49,376
When the time comes, the Mouna
is the face of the Lord, His mouth.

621
01:18:55,626 --> 01:18:59,543
The world with its trees came out
of the Mouna.

622
01:18:59,626 --> 01:19:03,501
Clouds, men...
One at a time, all races.

623
01:19:04,376 --> 01:19:08,876
Even woman came out of the Mouna.

624
01:19:10,001 --> 01:19:13,293
Hurrah for the Mouna,
the Mouna, the Mouna!

625
01:19:42,668 --> 01:19:44,709
Giacomo?

626
01:19:47,543 --> 01:19:48,459
Giacomo.

627
01:19:50,834 --> 01:19:53,209
What are you doing here?

628
01:19:54,709 --> 01:19:58,001
Egard! How strange to meet you.

629
01:19:59,001 --> 01:20:01,668
Maybe you can help me. Listen.

630
01:20:02,334 --> 01:20:08,251
"When I am drunk, I know neither
the sky nor the earth.

631
01:20:08,334 --> 01:20:13,126
I lie alone,
immobile in my bed.

632
01:20:15,293 --> 01:20:19,793
Until, in the end,
I forget that I exist.

633
01:20:20,709 --> 01:20:25,918
And at that moment
my happiness has no limits."

634
01:20:26,626 --> 01:20:32,126
Lung-ho-Tse: a Chinese poet
of the Eighth Century.

635
01:20:32,751 --> 01:20:35,501
You travel in lands
that do not exist, Egard.

636
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:37,626
Oh, Giacomo!

637
01:20:37,709 --> 01:20:40,418
I travel much too,
but in the real world.

638
01:20:40,876 --> 01:20:46,418
But where do your travels,
in the bodies of women, take you?

639
01:20:47,168 --> 01:20:49,543
No place.

640
01:20:49,918 --> 01:20:52,168
Something strange happened to me.

641
01:20:52,251 --> 01:20:54,376
Life, having nauseated me,
I wanted to kill myself.

642
01:20:54,459 --> 01:20:56,959
I was already inside
the waters of the river,

643
01:20:57,043 --> 01:20:59,209
reciting one of Tasso's sonnets,

644
01:20:59,293 --> 01:21:03,709
when I saw an extraordinary woman
pass by. She was over 7 feet tall.

645
01:21:03,793 --> 01:21:07,876
She aroused my curiosity. I tried
to follow her, but she disappeared.

646
01:21:07,959 --> 01:21:09,459
And I have lost hope of finding her.

647
01:21:10,418 --> 01:21:15,001
You have found her, Giacomo.
She is here.

648
01:21:16,043 --> 01:21:19,376
Princess Hathajaha!

649
01:21:19,459 --> 01:21:24,126
The tallest and strongest woman
in the world!

650
01:21:24,209 --> 01:21:26,418
A jug of beer
to who can defeat her!

651
01:21:26,501 --> 01:21:30,043
- Big John! That is who is needed.
- He will defeat her.

652
01:21:30,126 --> 01:21:33,376
- He will break her in two.
- Big John, come. They want you.

653
01:21:33,543 --> 01:21:36,793
Big John! Call the apothecaries!

654
01:21:37,168 --> 01:21:41,209
Call the surgeon
for your giant woman!

655
01:21:43,668 --> 01:21:46,501
Come on. She is not a cannibal!

656
01:21:47,126 --> 01:21:49,126
Who else? Who else?

657
01:22:10,918 --> 01:22:14,084
Whoever is brave,
will fight with the strong woman.

658
01:22:14,168 --> 01:22:17,209
Whoever is a coward, will run away!

659
01:22:18,043 --> 01:22:20,918
- What do you mean?
- Nothing, my lord.

660
01:22:21,001 --> 01:22:25,459
Do not think I said "coward"
to a gentlemen like you,

661
01:22:25,543 --> 01:22:30,209
certainly continental! It is not
possible that you have no honor.

662
01:22:30,293 --> 01:22:33,376
I am the sole custodian of my honor,

663
01:22:33,751 --> 01:22:37,418
and I consider any reference to it,
a violation.

664
01:22:37,501 --> 01:22:40,251
Do you accept fighting
for a jug of beer?

665
01:22:40,334 --> 01:22:44,668
Keep your beer.
Of course I will fight!

666
01:22:46,168 --> 01:22:51,001
I am a Venetian gentlemen.
I fought against the Turks.

667
01:22:52,043 --> 01:22:53,918
It is my turn, madam.

668
01:23:01,959 --> 01:23:04,418
He will not even get to five!

669
01:23:24,834 --> 01:23:27,917
Let me win. Do not make me give
a bad impression.

670
01:23:29,126 --> 01:23:31,167
Please.

671
01:23:32,001 --> 01:23:34,459
What do you think you are doing?

672
01:23:34,542 --> 01:23:37,876
- Are you Venetian?
- From the mountains.

673
01:24:26,209 --> 01:24:30,834
Who are you, mythological creature?
How did you end up in London?

674
01:24:33,042 --> 01:24:37,792
I had a bad marriage.
My husband sold me like an animal.

675
01:24:37,876 --> 01:24:41,084
I was weak
and could not defend myself.

676
01:24:45,542 --> 01:24:49,167
I like it here,
and enjoy the work.

677
01:24:49,251 --> 01:24:51,792
I like the people, good people.

678
01:25:11,542 --> 01:25:15,834
Come with me.
This is the fighting tent. See?

679
01:25:16,001 --> 01:25:18,334
Tonight she was an earthquake.

680
01:25:19,667 --> 01:25:23,209
She knocked down eight men
that were bigger than you.

681
01:25:35,167 --> 01:25:40,667
The strongest woman in the world
in one minute will become a fury!

682
01:25:44,584 --> 01:25:46,959
Go, Angelina!

683
01:25:50,001 --> 01:25:51,417
One!

684
01:25:52,251 --> 01:25:53,667
Two!

685
01:25:56,334 --> 01:25:57,751
Three!

686
01:25:58,251 --> 01:25:59,667
Four!

687
01:26:05,084 --> 01:26:07,126
Angelina, do not eat them!

688
01:26:07,209 --> 01:26:11,834
She is the strongest female in
the world! The queen of the forest.

689
01:26:16,376 --> 01:26:20,751
She won!
She threw eight men on the ground!

690
01:26:20,834 --> 01:26:24,542
Hurrah for the queen!
Hurrah for the queen!

691
01:26:31,292 --> 01:26:33,751
I absolutely must see her.

692
01:26:33,834 --> 01:26:35,292
It is forbidden.

693
01:26:37,584 --> 01:26:39,459
Follow me.

694
01:26:44,209 --> 01:26:46,625
The opening! Slowly!

695
01:26:57,292 --> 01:27:01,417
You know you should not stop
with people you do not know.

696
01:27:01,792 --> 01:27:04,250
You know nothing about
the evils of the world.

697
01:27:04,334 --> 01:27:09,500
Behind the face of a flower,
you can find a black heart.

698
01:27:09,959 --> 01:27:14,959
Remember how we ran that winter
in Hungary?

699
01:27:15,042 --> 01:27:18,667
You have long legs and with only
one step, you go where you want,

700
01:27:18,750 --> 01:27:22,250
but Ali' and I have short legs...

701
01:27:23,167 --> 01:27:26,709
Luckily, the elephant made
her die of fright!

702
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:30,250
Good. You put all the dolls
to sleep!

703
01:27:30,334 --> 01:27:33,667
Take off your clothes, Angelina.
The bath is ready.

704
01:27:36,209 --> 01:27:39,209
My cape fell!

705
01:27:39,292 --> 01:27:41,334
Good!

706
01:27:41,750 --> 01:27:45,584
Another blow like that and
Totonno will become a midget!

707
01:27:46,125 --> 01:27:48,167
The tub is full!

708
01:27:49,125 --> 01:27:51,500
- Come, Angelina.
- Is it hot?

709
01:27:51,584 --> 01:27:55,792
The other evening you made me sneeze
all night!

710
01:27:55,875 --> 01:27:59,000
Slowly. You will make
the water overflow!

711
01:28:14,542 --> 01:28:18,375
- Hold still!
- Stop, Angelina.

712
01:28:19,917 --> 01:28:23,417
- I put my foot in your hair.
- Yes, and in my balls!

713
01:28:26,167 --> 01:28:28,459
Angelina, sing that song
from your country

714
01:28:28,542 --> 01:28:32,250
which makes me nostalgic
about my country.

715
01:29:32,125 --> 01:29:34,542
The horses are ready, Sir.

716
01:29:51,292 --> 01:29:53,334
Everyone has left.

717
01:30:34,250 --> 01:30:36,667
What an unforgettable day!

718
01:30:36,750 --> 01:30:40,208
How exciting that day in Rome
when the Holy Father

719
01:30:40,292 --> 01:30:44,708
let me kiss his loving hand
so many times.

720
01:30:44,958 --> 01:30:49,417
On that same evening I was invited
to Lord Talou's patrician building.

721
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:52,292
He was the English ambassador
to the holy city of Rome.

722
01:30:55,750 --> 01:30:58,500
It is him! My handsome Carluccio!

723
01:30:58,583 --> 01:31:00,625
Come on, Carluccio!

724
01:31:09,167 --> 01:31:11,958
Come on, run!

725
01:31:25,333 --> 01:31:27,458
Come on, handsome!
You can make it!

726
01:31:35,208 --> 01:31:38,542
Carluccio, run as you do
when you run away from the police!

727
01:31:46,292 --> 01:31:50,125
Run, Carluccio!
Run as if I were riding you!

728
01:32:10,917 --> 01:32:14,917
My dear Giacomo,
welcome to Rome.

729
01:32:16,042 --> 01:32:18,875
Thank you for accepting
my invitation.

730
01:32:18,958 --> 01:32:23,167
This evening we will not play,
at least not with cards!

731
01:32:23,250 --> 01:32:27,625
It does not matter, my lord.
Your company pleases me, anyway.

732
01:32:27,708 --> 01:32:29,792
Is this magnificent building yours?

733
01:32:29,875 --> 01:32:33,083
No. I rented it from the Prince
Del Brando for 100 guineas,

734
01:32:33,167 --> 01:32:35,625
including his hams.

735
01:32:50,750 --> 01:32:53,292
Lord Talou, try to stop them!

736
01:32:53,375 --> 01:32:57,375
I know them. When they drink,
they make you go mad!

737
01:32:57,458 --> 01:33:01,292
Lord Talou, he will break his head!
Stop, Rolando!

738
01:33:04,750 --> 01:33:07,958
Take him below and send him away.

739
01:33:10,542 --> 01:33:13,625
That stupid idiot has no balls!

740
01:33:14,500 --> 01:33:18,750
- I won!
- The competition is over. Carlo won.

741
01:33:18,833 --> 01:33:22,083
Natale, check if the basin
is empty!

742
01:33:22,167 --> 01:33:26,667
The competition is over.
The basin is empty. Carlo won!

743
01:33:26,750 --> 01:33:29,250
You are not giving me a little kiss?

744
01:33:33,875 --> 01:33:37,208
It is embarrassing to admit that
the city where the Holy Father lives

745
01:33:37,292 --> 01:33:39,833
is still like the days
of Trimalcione.

746
01:33:42,250 --> 01:33:46,625
In the Piombi prison,
one could not play certain games,

747
01:33:46,708 --> 01:33:49,250
especially for lack of space.

748
01:33:49,333 --> 01:33:51,458
If I know who
I have the honor of...

749
01:33:51,541 --> 01:33:53,458
I am the Prince Del Brando.

750
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:58,541
Excellency, everyone knows I was
thrown into that miserable prison

751
01:33:58,625 --> 01:34:01,000
for noble political causes.

752
01:34:01,083 --> 01:34:04,750
I will not even allow a prince
to make certain insinuations

753
01:34:04,833 --> 01:34:07,375
on the injustice I underwent there.

754
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:12,416
Do not take my joke so seriously!

755
01:34:13,208 --> 01:34:14,791
Wine!

756
01:34:16,375 --> 01:34:20,541
I have heard of you, Mister Casanova.
I am your great admirer.

757
01:34:20,625 --> 01:34:24,625
If I were a woman, I would not have
hesitated to come to bed with you.

758
01:34:24,958 --> 01:34:28,375
I heard many great things
about you!

759
01:34:28,458 --> 01:34:31,500
I thank you. The admiration
of such a gentleman like you

760
01:34:31,583 --> 01:34:33,625
makes me undoubtedly proud.

761
01:34:34,958 --> 01:34:39,708
Your merits were compared
to those of a stallion,

762
01:34:39,833 --> 01:34:43,291
and sometimes to those
of a less noble animal.

763
01:34:43,375 --> 01:34:44,958
What do you mean?

764
01:34:45,041 --> 01:34:47,750
From this point of view, I mean!

765
01:34:47,833 --> 01:34:52,250
Your jokes should be taken seriously,
because they are not humorous.

766
01:34:53,166 --> 01:34:56,250
I will smash this lying pig!

767
01:34:57,208 --> 01:35:02,833
This gentleman from Venice is a poet,
a philosopher, a mathematician,

768
01:35:02,916 --> 01:35:05,583
and is learned in who knows
how many other things.

769
01:35:05,666 --> 01:35:09,416
I know someone who can do better
than you in a certain field.

770
01:35:09,500 --> 01:35:11,541
- Who?
- Righetto.

771
01:35:12,541 --> 01:35:14,583
Where is Righetto?

772
01:35:14,833 --> 01:35:18,500
Find Righetto, my coachman.
Tell him to come here!

773
01:35:18,583 --> 01:35:22,541
He is outside, Excellency!
Righetto, come here. They want you.

774
01:35:22,625 --> 01:35:24,041
At your command, Prince.

775
01:35:24,125 --> 01:35:29,500
Righetto, how many times did you
make love last night with Ubaldina?

776
01:35:31,083 --> 01:35:33,041
Come on, answer!

777
01:35:34,583 --> 01:35:37,041
With everyone's respect, 7 times.

778
01:35:40,958 --> 01:35:42,291
He is lying.

779
01:35:42,375 --> 01:35:47,833
Brutal force alone is not capable
of such amorous feats.

780
01:35:47,916 --> 01:35:50,958
Only a body supported by cleverness,
intelligence,

781
01:35:51,041 --> 01:35:53,375
and culture can reach such peaks.

782
01:35:53,458 --> 01:35:58,375
I know what I am talking about.
A moral maturity is required,

783
01:35:58,458 --> 01:36:03,083
and especially knowledge
of movement of fluids,

784
01:36:03,166 --> 01:36:05,916
of star and planet influences.

785
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,500
Excellent, Giacomo. Excellent.

786
01:36:08,583 --> 01:36:12,458
You convinced everyone
with your eloquence.

787
01:36:13,708 --> 01:36:19,500
Why not accept a challenge?
Brutal force against intelligence.

788
01:36:19,583 --> 01:36:23,041
The good savage exalted
by that boring Rousseau,

789
01:36:23,125 --> 01:36:26,125
against the gentleman
with style and culture.

790
01:36:27,583 --> 01:36:30,541
- What does it mean?
- I shall explain.

791
01:36:30,625 --> 01:36:34,875
Righetto and Casanova are invited
to participate in a competition.

792
01:36:34,958 --> 01:36:38,333
Who can do it more times
in an hour, right?

793
01:36:38,416 --> 01:36:40,458
Right!

794
01:36:41,625 --> 01:36:46,000
I am very disappointed that you,
such a good host,

795
01:36:46,083 --> 01:36:49,000
should risk the honor
of your guest,

796
01:36:49,083 --> 01:36:52,416
by obliging him in a competition
with a coachman!

797
01:36:52,500 --> 01:36:56,916
Mister Giacomo, do not take Lord
Talou's proposal the wrong way.

798
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:01,625
On the contrary, it honors you.

799
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:07,500
Why not consider it a competition
between vulgarity and poetry?

800
01:37:08,708 --> 01:37:13,958
I, to begin with,
am convinced that you will win.

801
01:37:14,333 --> 01:37:19,041
Once again, homo sapiens
will defeat primitive man.

802
01:37:21,958 --> 01:37:24,499
Madam, your way of...

803
01:37:24,958 --> 01:37:27,333
speaking, of exposing...

804
01:37:27,416 --> 01:37:30,458
However, I am certain
that the victory will be mine.

805
01:37:30,541 --> 01:37:34,416
In any case, it is clear
that I must choose my companion

806
01:37:34,499 --> 01:37:35,249
in this competition.

807
01:37:35,333 --> 01:37:40,083
- He is right. He should choose her.
- It is his right!

808
01:37:42,166 --> 01:37:44,999
My choice goes to...

809
01:37:47,874 --> 01:37:49,916
Romana.

810
01:37:56,874 --> 01:38:00,541
Romana, the most beautiful
model in Rome.

811
01:38:02,083 --> 01:38:06,249
Her generous forms have often
been immortalized on canvas, marble.

812
01:38:06,333 --> 01:38:09,166
Romana, the Venus
of the countryside!

813
01:38:09,249 --> 01:38:13,583
Now bring me a basket of eggs,
a bottle of wine from Spain,

814
01:38:13,666 --> 01:38:15,749
ginger, cinnamon, and clover.

815
01:38:15,833 --> 01:38:18,541
My necklace on Casanova!

816
01:38:19,166 --> 01:38:24,791
My robust Righetto, will you accept
me as the woman, who, for one hour,

817
01:38:24,874 --> 01:38:28,708
will receive the impulses
of your rustic loins?

818
01:38:29,999 --> 01:38:33,249
May the good Lord
make me worthy, Princess.

819
01:38:33,333 --> 01:38:35,458
Challengers, go to your places,

820
01:38:35,541 --> 01:38:40,458
and begin their pleasant,
I hope, trial.

821
01:38:41,791 --> 01:38:47,458
He put eighteen eggs inside!
God protect you and give you health!

822
01:38:47,541 --> 01:38:51,083
Oh! Nineteen!

823
01:38:51,666 --> 01:38:54,541
He is drinking all of them!

824
01:38:55,166 --> 01:38:57,374
What do you have inside there?

825
01:38:57,458 --> 01:39:00,708
Where will all those eggs
come out from?

826
01:39:00,791 --> 01:39:03,749
How do you feel?
Flabby, flabby, huh?

827
01:39:04,166 --> 01:39:06,874
What does he want now?

828
01:39:10,833 --> 01:39:13,708
With such an omelet in his stomach!

829
01:39:13,958 --> 01:39:16,791
I bet on you, and I want to win!

830
01:39:20,499 --> 01:39:23,874
Make sure that I win.

831
01:39:25,124 --> 01:39:27,999
If I bet on you,
will you make me win?

832
01:39:31,499 --> 01:39:34,458
I will do everything
to make you win.

833
01:39:34,541 --> 01:39:37,833
The challenge entailing
four testicles is about to begin!

834
01:39:38,249 --> 01:39:41,416
A great poet
against a dirty primitive!

835
01:39:41,499 --> 01:39:45,291
Move from there.
It is not something for children.

836
01:39:52,499 --> 01:39:55,624
- Is it shaped the way the say?
- Go away!

837
01:39:57,916 --> 01:40:00,666
I bet both my horses on Casanova.

838
01:40:13,458 --> 01:40:16,083
Righetto, help me.

839
01:40:18,083 --> 01:40:21,999
This for the back
and this for the head.

840
01:40:25,333 --> 01:40:28,749
- Righetto, take my shoes off.
- Your servant, Princess.

841
01:40:31,833 --> 01:40:34,333
Be silent!

842
01:40:34,416 --> 01:40:38,041
Thirty seconds left!

843
01:40:45,499 --> 01:40:49,582
- Shall I get undressed too?
- Of course.

844
01:40:52,166 --> 01:40:57,999
Silence, please! The competition
will begin in 20 seconds!

845
01:41:06,374 --> 01:41:09,499
Fifteen seconds left!

846
01:41:15,666 --> 01:41:17,749
Ten seconds!

847
01:41:19,457 --> 01:41:21,416
Nine seconds!

848
01:41:22,582 --> 01:41:24,624
Eight seconds!

849
01:41:24,916 --> 01:41:26,332
Seven!

850
01:41:27,166 --> 01:41:29,207
Six seconds!

851
01:41:30,041 --> 01:41:31,832
Five!

852
01:41:31,916 --> 01:41:34,416
Four seconds!

853
01:41:34,499 --> 01:41:35,916
Three!

854
01:41:35,999 --> 01:41:38,041
Two seconds!

855
01:41:38,374 --> 01:41:39,499
One second!

856
01:41:39,582 --> 01:41:41,124
Go!

857
01:42:15,541 --> 01:42:17,957
Three! He already did three!

858
01:42:18,041 --> 01:42:22,374
How do you feel down there?
Want me to substitute you?

859
01:42:24,207 --> 01:42:28,624
Righetto is very nervous,
but he is calming down now.

860
01:42:28,707 --> 01:42:30,332
He did two!

861
01:42:36,291 --> 01:42:38,624
Three! Righetto, three!

862
01:43:12,541 --> 01:43:15,832
Hurrah for the performance
of the trial!

863
01:43:23,791 --> 01:43:26,916
If you had not won,
I would have mounted you!

864
01:43:26,999 --> 01:43:29,082
Let us bring him in triumph!

865
01:43:40,082 --> 01:43:42,124
Bravo!

866
01:43:42,499 --> 01:43:48,499
Who will let you leave now?
Rome is yours!

867
01:44:16,499 --> 01:44:19,874
I would like to tell you
about a marvelous creature

868
01:44:19,957 --> 01:44:23,665
who my restless spirit
looked for all my life.

869
01:44:27,540 --> 01:44:30,749
I was in Switzerland,
in the antique town of Bern,

870
01:44:30,832 --> 01:44:34,790
a guest of Doctor Moebius,
a famous entomologist.

871
01:44:37,624 --> 01:44:41,249
I was looking at his daughters
at work, scientists and seers,

872
01:44:46,040 --> 01:44:49,374
when suddenly a silence
isolated me from everything,

873
01:44:49,457 --> 01:44:53,290
and I was overtaken
by a strange ill feeling.

874
01:47:48,998 --> 01:47:51,457
The miracle took place.

875
01:47:52,290 --> 01:47:57,123
Not only am I cured, but I feel much
better and stronger than before.

876
01:47:57,207 --> 01:47:59,957
It is thanks to you,
my adorable scientists.

877
01:48:00,040 --> 01:48:07,082
You made me become ill and
you gave me back the joy of health.

878
01:48:08,832 --> 01:48:11,332
Why do you say we made you ill?

879
01:48:11,415 --> 01:48:13,457
Did I say that?

880
01:48:14,290 --> 01:48:15,707
Strange.

881
01:48:16,873 --> 01:48:18,623
I do not know.

882
01:48:20,248 --> 01:48:22,082
Oh, yes. I remember.

883
01:48:22,873 --> 01:48:27,165
Those horrible insects
with those monstrous demon forms

884
01:48:27,248 --> 01:48:30,040
that move about without a reason.

885
01:48:30,957 --> 01:48:34,832
Evil!
Evil in its living state.

886
01:48:35,207 --> 01:48:37,290
And you there,
with your big pins...

887
01:48:37,373 --> 01:48:41,373
Seeing both of you piercing
them, one by one... horrible!

888
01:48:41,457 --> 01:48:44,998
Was it as if you were pierced
a thousand times?

889
01:48:45,082 --> 01:48:50,123
Yes. The pain I imagined
was so real on me,

890
01:48:50,207 --> 01:48:52,373
that it overwhelmed me.

891
01:48:53,873 --> 01:48:57,790
I am very sensitive, without a doubt.

892
01:48:58,123 --> 01:49:01,873
I am a creature of elements,
air, water...

893
01:49:01,957 --> 01:49:05,957
And fire, too.
That is what I heard about you.

894
01:49:15,957 --> 01:49:18,665
My God, how beautiful you are.

895
01:49:18,998 --> 01:49:22,957
Your gracious smile
is so descreet.

896
01:49:23,040 --> 01:49:26,040
It is like those figures
on Etruscan tombs.

897
01:49:26,123 --> 01:49:29,040
A merry and deathly smile.

898
01:49:29,123 --> 01:49:33,248
Deathly? Is that how you speak
to who saved you from death?

899
01:49:33,332 --> 01:49:37,790
Only to deliver me to another
sweet death, that of love.

900
01:49:37,873 --> 01:49:41,957
I feel that I want to be annulled
inside of you, my wise Minerva.

901
01:49:42,207 --> 01:49:44,790
What a strange man you are,
Giacomo.

902
01:49:44,873 --> 01:49:49,207
You cannot talk about love
without using deathly figures?

903
01:49:49,290 --> 01:49:53,998
The sweetest of deaths. You want
to annul yourself in love...

904
01:49:54,582 --> 01:49:59,290
Maybe there is more to love.
You wish to die?

905
01:50:00,165 --> 01:50:04,248
As late as possible,
enchanting Isabella.

906
01:50:04,332 --> 01:50:08,582
When that moment comes, I want
to be able to squeeze your hand.

907
01:50:08,665 --> 01:50:11,915
Would you like to eat?
Yes?

908
01:50:29,623 --> 01:50:33,623
Isabella, I finally understand
the mysterious evil

909
01:50:33,707 --> 01:50:36,915
that struck me in this house,
that brought a light inside of me.

910
01:50:36,998 --> 01:50:40,873
I want a different life,
one in the quiet of my study.

911
01:50:40,957 --> 01:50:43,832
I want to give up
my useless, boring freedom

912
01:50:43,915 --> 01:50:46,998
and always be lovingly guided
by you.

913
01:50:47,082 --> 01:50:51,290
Say yes, Isabella.
I beg you, my illuminated savior.

914
01:50:51,415 --> 01:50:54,123
You are mad, Giacomo.

915
01:50:54,373 --> 01:50:59,498
Maybe you speak like this because
you are still weak from your illness.

916
01:50:59,582 --> 01:51:03,623
Listen to me, Isabella. You cannot
refuse me, or I will be ill again,

917
01:51:03,707 --> 01:51:05,873
and this time, forever.

918
01:51:05,957 --> 01:51:09,623
I was right in saying
that you are made of fire.

919
01:51:09,706 --> 01:51:15,665
Tomorrow I am leaving.
Please, Isabella, come with me.

920
01:51:19,331 --> 01:51:21,498
No, it cannot be.

921
01:51:22,165 --> 01:51:27,706
- Join me in Dresda.
- Dresda? How is that possible?

922
01:51:28,706 --> 01:51:29,706
I...

923
01:51:36,373 --> 01:51:38,206
Oh, Giacomo!

924
01:51:38,290 --> 01:51:42,790
Yes, alright.
At the Moors' inn in Dresda.

925
01:51:43,956 --> 01:51:45,581
My life!

926
01:52:22,456 --> 01:52:24,915
A lady is expecting me.
Have you been informed?

927
01:52:26,665 --> 01:52:29,540
It is not necessary.
Answer my question.

928
01:52:33,248 --> 01:52:36,665
Is there someone among you
expecting this gentleman?

929
01:52:51,415 --> 01:52:56,040
Isabella, you cannot
have betrayed me.

930
01:52:57,831 --> 01:53:00,081
I know you will come.

931
01:53:00,623 --> 01:53:03,706
I shall wait here
all my life, if need be.

932
01:53:04,248 --> 01:53:06,790
It is not possible!

933
01:53:08,331 --> 01:53:11,373
Look who is here! Giacomo!

934
01:53:14,040 --> 01:53:16,331
You are here, handsome!

935
01:53:19,290 --> 01:53:21,790
There is nothing to laugh about!

936
01:53:22,165 --> 01:53:23,706
Hello, old friend!

937
01:53:23,790 --> 01:53:26,331
He is better than four stallions!

938
01:53:30,498 --> 01:53:34,623
Madam, excuse me. I believe I do not
have the honor of knowing you.

939
01:53:34,706 --> 01:53:36,248
Are you playing precious with me?

940
01:53:36,331 --> 01:53:40,415
With Astrodi, the singer,
who once you graciously

941
01:53:40,498 --> 01:53:42,790
- gave her your attention.
- Madam, please...

942
01:53:42,873 --> 01:53:45,998
Remember in Venice in the home
of the woman with the fat buttocks?

943
01:53:46,081 --> 01:53:50,373
I am doing a theater performance
where the grand duke will attend.

944
01:53:50,456 --> 01:53:53,540
I have an appointment now.

945
01:53:55,040 --> 01:53:59,498
There is a naughty German girl
in the group who will do anything.

946
01:53:59,581 --> 01:54:01,956
There she is! Hey, you!

947
01:54:02,206 --> 01:54:05,290
German girl,
come out from under there!

948
01:54:05,665 --> 01:54:08,748
There is a real gentleman
who wants to meet you.

949
01:54:08,831 --> 01:54:11,248
She is hunchback like the devil.

950
01:54:11,331 --> 01:54:13,290
Wait, look.

951
01:54:15,081 --> 01:54:18,456
Pull out your tongue.
Stupid, pull it out!

952
01:54:29,456 --> 01:54:33,748
She is greedy, a "handle eater"!

953
01:54:38,623 --> 01:54:41,289
Inn keeper! The best room.

954
01:54:41,789 --> 01:54:43,581
I will spend the night here.

955
01:55:10,998 --> 01:55:14,164
She is an earthquake!
Come see!

956
01:55:18,581 --> 01:55:20,623
Glutton!

957
01:55:38,664 --> 01:55:42,331
Wait! Wait! I shall sit here
so I can see better!

958
01:55:42,581 --> 01:55:45,414
Come out.
You must see everything!

959
01:55:53,831 --> 01:55:57,331
I am falling!
Gisella, give me a hand!

960
02:00:21,372 --> 02:00:22,997
Giacomo.

961
02:00:36,997 --> 02:00:41,747
Do you not recognize me?
I did so immediately, "cabalon"!

962
02:00:41,831 --> 02:00:45,456
Mother! It is really you!

963
02:00:50,872 --> 02:00:54,039
Did you forget that your mother
lives in Dresda?

964
02:00:54,122 --> 02:00:59,872
I have 400 thalers retirement money,
thanks to the prince's generosity.

965
02:00:59,956 --> 02:01:01,206
My God protect him!

966
02:01:02,206 --> 02:01:06,247
- I knew you were in Saxony...
- What are you doing here?

967
02:01:06,331 --> 02:01:08,206
I am here on business.

968
02:01:08,289 --> 02:01:11,706
For a project that the minister
is interested in.

969
02:01:11,789 --> 02:01:15,747
An excellent project, I must say.
An excellent occasion.

970
02:01:15,831 --> 02:01:20,664
I see, the usual fables,
the usual nonsense.

971
02:01:20,747 --> 02:01:24,081
You never send a cent
to your poor, old mother!

972
02:01:25,706 --> 02:01:28,997
I did not know your address,
Mother!

973
02:01:29,081 --> 02:01:31,081
- You never know anything!
- It is true!

974
02:01:31,164 --> 02:01:35,789
I wanted to write to you,
visit you sometimes, but...

975
02:01:36,080 --> 02:01:39,080
- And your second husband?
- He is dead.

976
02:01:42,205 --> 02:01:45,580
- Do you live here in Dresda?
- No, I live in the country.

977
02:01:47,789 --> 02:01:51,039
I could come to your house
for a few days.

978
02:01:51,122 --> 02:01:54,539
As long as my business
allows me, but I hope so.

979
02:01:54,622 --> 02:01:57,705
- In my house, with me?
- Yes.

980
02:02:05,330 --> 02:02:07,664
Are you expecting someone,
Mother?

981
02:02:07,872 --> 02:02:12,039
I am waiting to be taken
to the carriage.

982
02:02:12,122 --> 02:02:15,205
My poor legs do not stand up
anymore!

983
02:02:15,289 --> 02:02:18,497
I shall come to get you.
I shall take you.

984
02:02:18,580 --> 02:02:20,372
I am coming up.

985
02:02:37,205 --> 02:02:38,622
Mother.

986
02:02:40,455 --> 02:02:42,289
How long it has been!

987
02:02:42,414 --> 02:02:44,247
How are you?

988
02:02:44,914 --> 02:02:46,539
Slowly!

989
02:02:50,622 --> 02:02:52,872
- Turn around now.
- On the shoulders.

990
02:02:52,955 --> 02:02:56,830
Get lower! Get lower!

991
02:03:09,580 --> 02:03:13,247
You are wrong, Mother
in saying I am just a "cabalon".

992
02:03:13,330 --> 02:03:17,455
My name is known in all of Europe.

993
02:03:17,539 --> 02:03:19,664
I am considered a literary person.

994
02:03:19,830 --> 02:03:21,789
A brilliant business man.

995
02:03:23,580 --> 02:03:26,247
I do not understand German well,
Mother. What are you saying?

996
02:03:26,330 --> 02:03:29,830
You do not understand
or do not want to?

997
02:03:32,872 --> 02:03:37,289
I could find a house in the country,
maybe next to yours.

998
02:03:37,372 --> 02:03:41,289
I have 400 sequins.
I can give you half if you want.

999
02:03:41,872 --> 02:03:45,955
I intend to stop running around
the world. I am no longer young.

1000
02:03:46,580 --> 02:03:49,164
Do you have news of our relatives?

1001
02:03:49,247 --> 02:03:52,330
I also hope to return to Venice,
as soon as...

1002
02:04:50,664 --> 02:04:53,622
I did not even ask for her address!

1003
02:05:03,080 --> 02:05:06,497
I went to Holland, to Belgium,
to Spain.

1004
02:05:06,955 --> 02:05:09,538
In Oslo, I became seriously ill.

1005
02:05:09,622 --> 02:05:11,580
Finally I reached Wurtemberg,

1006
02:05:11,663 --> 02:05:15,080
which, at the time, was the most
brilliant court of Europe.

1007
02:05:55,455 --> 02:05:59,955
I would like to ask you, madam,
since you wisely influence the duke,

1008
02:06:00,038 --> 02:06:04,038
could you not suggest to him to
offer me the position of ambassador

1009
02:06:04,122 --> 02:06:09,247
to the court of Saxony?
The prince highly respects me.

1010
02:06:45,080 --> 02:06:49,163
I have a letter from his excellency
Cardinal Lowrier.

1011
02:06:49,247 --> 02:06:53,163
He kindly accepted
to recommend me to you.

1012
02:06:53,247 --> 02:06:56,247
I would like to submit
to the attention of your...

1013
02:07:25,205 --> 02:07:28,747
In my country, turtles are a sign
of good luck, Highness.

1014
02:08:24,747 --> 02:08:27,872
Here are the designs
for a new type of fortress

1015
02:08:27,955 --> 02:08:30,413
based on three principles
of Democritus and Leucippus.

1016
02:08:30,497 --> 02:08:32,955
I know that your war
at the borders...

1017
02:09:15,955 --> 02:09:17,663
Observe these seeds, Highness.

1018
02:09:17,746 --> 02:09:21,621
They produce a repulsive
red efflurescence,

1019
02:09:21,705 --> 02:09:25,121
but it has miraculous virtues.
It was discovered by a Spanish monk

1020
02:09:25,205 --> 02:09:28,955
who experimented it many times
on himself.

1021
02:09:29,080 --> 02:09:33,413
Nobody in the world could say
that man is over 40,

1022
02:09:33,496 --> 02:09:37,330
but he actually is over one hundred.

1023
02:09:39,955 --> 02:09:42,705
Princess,
I am desperate in my love for you

1024
02:09:42,788 --> 02:09:44,746
but your heart is of iron!

1025
02:09:44,830 --> 02:09:47,663
And your buttocks is of wood!

1026
02:09:50,455 --> 02:09:52,663
Never in my life

1027
02:09:52,746 --> 02:09:55,996
have I been so insulted!

1028
02:09:56,621 --> 02:09:59,413
I will no longer permit
that he come before my eyes,

1029
02:09:59,496 --> 02:10:03,205
even if I am in this palace,
and my duty as a guest

1030
02:10:03,288 --> 02:10:06,413
does not allow me to take up
my sword!

1031
02:10:06,496 --> 02:10:09,996
Go away, scoundrels,
back to your sewers!

1032
02:10:22,121 --> 02:10:27,121
My brother, the Duke, says you
frightened Rosalba with your sword.

1033
02:10:27,205 --> 02:10:32,413
That is not good for a Latin
lover of beautiful women as you are.

1034
02:10:32,496 --> 02:10:33,871
Enchanting!

1035
02:10:33,955 --> 02:10:37,955
I heard that in Nuremberg
a general had built

1036
02:10:38,038 --> 02:10:43,705
a mechanical chess player,
but this goes beyond any imagination.

1037
02:10:44,580 --> 02:10:47,996
Look! It is perfect!

1038
02:10:48,080 --> 02:10:51,205
One could swear it is real flesh.

1039
02:10:52,163 --> 02:10:53,830
The right color.

1040
02:10:54,788 --> 02:10:56,871
It would fool anyone.

1041
02:12:09,204 --> 02:12:12,621
It is very late.
Are you still up?

1042
02:15:50,204 --> 02:15:55,996
I hope you will excuse me,
Madam, for the liberty I took.

1043
02:15:56,079 --> 02:15:59,787
But I so much wish
to see what you are, naturally.

1044
02:16:00,079 --> 02:16:02,121
You do not protest?

1045
02:16:06,537 --> 02:16:09,371
What sort of mad inventor
was your father?

1046
02:16:09,704 --> 02:16:15,204
Certainly mad, but a poet,
if he made you so beautiful.

1047
02:16:17,037 --> 02:16:20,787
Did he incestuously possess you?

1048
02:16:22,454 --> 02:16:25,871
You excite me
with your secret silence.

1049
02:16:25,954 --> 02:16:28,579
Will you lie down with me?

1050
02:16:28,662 --> 02:16:33,371
Will you give your delicate
mechanism to my eagerness?

1051
02:16:34,662 --> 02:16:37,079
Yes? Oh, yes!

1052
02:16:44,162 --> 02:16:45,704
You are beautiful, you know?

1053
02:16:46,621 --> 02:16:49,912
Do not refuse.
What is your name?

1054
02:16:50,412 --> 02:16:52,162
Oh, Rosalba!

1055
02:16:53,079 --> 02:16:56,954
No, Rosalba. You are called love!
Love!

1056
02:16:58,954 --> 02:17:02,079
That is your name!
Do you know that?

1057
02:17:02,496 --> 02:17:05,662
I have been looking for you forever.

1058
02:17:07,204 --> 02:17:09,912
Beautiful! Child!

1059
02:17:28,871 --> 02:17:31,871
My beautiful devil!

1060
02:17:38,829 --> 02:17:41,912
Love. Give it to me!

1061
02:20:21,537 --> 02:20:24,745
The winter is very long in Bohemia.

1062
02:20:24,829 --> 02:20:29,870
For many years I have been living
in Dux, in the Waldenstein castle.

1063
02:20:29,954 --> 02:20:32,995
I am a librarian for the count.

1064
02:20:33,079 --> 02:20:38,954
An important assignment that
is fit for my studious character,

1065
02:20:39,037 --> 02:20:41,787
for a man of literature.

1066
02:21:08,537 --> 02:21:11,037
Do you feel better this evening?
It is very warm.

1067
02:21:25,370 --> 02:21:29,454
My macaroni!
I want my macaroni!

1068
02:21:29,537 --> 02:21:33,037
I did not prepare macaroni
this evening. No macaroni!

1069
02:21:33,120 --> 02:21:35,954
If you want,
there is goat fried brain.

1070
02:21:36,037 --> 02:21:41,537
I clearly said I want macaroni
on my plate every evening!

1071
02:21:41,620 --> 02:21:44,954
If that is not possible,
the count will be informed.

1072
02:21:45,037 --> 02:21:48,245
There is polenta,
which is almost ready.

1073
02:21:49,329 --> 02:21:51,537
I do not want polenta!

1074
02:21:51,620 --> 02:21:57,329
I cannot stand that my dinner
be disturbed by such people!

1075
02:21:57,412 --> 02:22:01,204
Mister Casanova,
your agreement with the count

1076
02:22:01,287 --> 02:22:04,537
dispenses you from eating
with the servants and the troops.

1077
02:22:05,787 --> 02:22:08,120
Then why do you give us
this honor?

1078
02:22:08,204 --> 02:22:11,412
Listen, Faulkircher.

1079
02:22:11,495 --> 02:22:15,912
Only because of one
of life's cruel turn of events,

1080
02:22:15,995 --> 02:22:19,037
that the two of us met.

1081
02:22:19,162 --> 02:22:22,995
You, a butler,
and I a librarian.

1082
02:22:23,079 --> 02:22:28,662
Respect my solitude and keep away
from me!

1083
02:22:28,745 --> 02:22:31,162
You are a cheating scoundrel!

1084
02:22:31,245 --> 02:22:36,870
You take advantage of the count's
absence, but he will find out!

1085
02:22:36,953 --> 02:22:39,787
Also that you practice

1086
02:22:39,870 --> 02:22:47,537
anti-physical attractions
with your Viderol. You disgust me!

1087
02:22:47,620 --> 02:22:51,328
Go ahead and speak
in your vulgar German!

1088
02:22:51,412 --> 02:22:53,287
Who understands you?

1089
02:22:53,370 --> 02:22:59,120
I am an artist, a writer.
I do not mingle with certain people.

1090
02:22:59,203 --> 02:23:02,537
He is an artist too,
a very talented actor.

1091
02:23:02,620 --> 02:23:05,120
It disgusts me to talk to you.

1092
02:23:05,203 --> 02:23:08,287
Do not be so arrogant, Casanova.

1093
02:23:08,370 --> 02:23:12,370
You are a servant of the count
of Waldenstein, like us. A servant!

1094
02:23:12,453 --> 02:23:14,828
Disgusting! You are disgusting!

1095
02:23:20,995 --> 02:23:26,662
I received the greatest insult ever,
in this place.

1096
02:23:26,745 --> 02:23:30,703
That portrait has been hung up
with a disgusting substance.

1097
02:23:30,787 --> 02:23:34,703
The person responsible is Faulkircher
or his deprived lover Viderol.

1098
02:23:35,078 --> 02:23:39,162
Which of the two furnished
the fecal material, I do not know,

1099
02:23:39,245 --> 02:23:42,453
considering their terrible
relationship

1100
02:23:42,537 --> 02:23:46,537
which easily enables
mixture of that substance.

1101
02:23:47,162 --> 02:23:51,537
Observe.
It is a very similar portrait.

1102
02:23:58,078 --> 02:24:03,953
It was printed as an illustration
in my famous novel "Icosameron".

1103
02:24:04,703 --> 02:24:07,162
Did you read it by chance?

1104
02:24:07,620 --> 02:24:09,828
I will offer you a copy, if I may.

1105
02:24:09,912 --> 02:24:16,370
I think that after my death there
will be talk of me for some time,

1106
02:24:16,453 --> 02:24:21,995
as author of that work.
I am a famous Italian writer.

1107
02:24:28,203 --> 02:24:31,370
You surely know my name.

1108
02:24:34,162 --> 02:24:37,912
Giacomo Casanova from Venice.

1109
02:24:39,245 --> 02:24:40,745
A literary man,

1110
02:24:41,412 --> 02:24:43,037
a philosopher...

1111
02:24:48,037 --> 02:24:51,870
It is not for a whim
that I come to you, Countess,

1112
02:24:51,953 --> 02:24:56,620
but to implore justice
for a poor old man.

1113
02:24:57,037 --> 02:25:03,828
That shady individual, Faulkircher,
and that Viderol

1114
02:25:03,995 --> 02:25:07,328
find many pretexts to torment me.

1115
02:25:07,412 --> 02:25:11,495
They broke the door of the library,
and took away books.

1116
02:25:11,578 --> 02:25:15,912
And they blame me
for their disappearance!

1117
02:25:15,995 --> 02:25:18,662
And I have not eaten macaroni
since Wednesday!

1118
02:25:19,620 --> 02:25:23,912
These unpleasant happenings
disturb my activity as writer.

1119
02:25:24,203 --> 02:25:26,745
What should I do, Countess?

1120
02:25:28,370 --> 02:25:33,120
When my son returns,
he will take care of everything.

1121
02:25:37,620 --> 02:25:43,162
There is a crane
above the wood-shack roof.

1122
02:26:03,037 --> 02:26:05,786
I want you to meet Giacomo Casanova,

1123
02:26:06,620 --> 02:26:10,661
an Italian adventurer
who there has been much talk about.

1124
02:26:17,953 --> 02:26:19,578
Giacomo!

1125
02:26:20,411 --> 02:26:25,245
Come. We are waiting for you.
My friends want to hear you.

1126
02:26:25,328 --> 02:26:27,661
Recite something.

1127
02:30:19,619 --> 02:30:21,036
Venice!

1128
02:30:25,744 --> 02:30:28,744
Will I ever return to Venice?

1129
02:30:32,661 --> 02:30:34,286
The other night...

1130
02:30:37,119 --> 02:30:38,619
I had a dream...

1131
02:31:07,619 --> 02:31:08,744
Isabella.
