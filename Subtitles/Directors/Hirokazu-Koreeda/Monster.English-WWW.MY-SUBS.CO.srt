1
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,121
<i>Firetruck behind you.
Please clear the road.</i>

2
00:01:52,281 --> 00:01:58,961
MONSTER

3
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,160
Minato?

4
00:02:17,121 --> 00:02:18,680
A fire, a fire.

5
00:02:18,881 --> 00:02:20,400
Minato?

6
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,040
Come look.

7
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,761
It's a fire.

8
00:02:29,721 --> 00:02:31,401
Don't fall.

9
00:02:44,961 --> 00:02:49,160
If a human gets a pig's brain
transplanted, is it a human or a pig?

10
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,760
What are you talking about?

11
00:02:52,121 --> 00:02:53,840
There's research.

12
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,480
Who told you that?

13
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,521
My teacher, Mr. Hori.

14
00:03:01,441 --> 00:03:06,400
They teach weird stuff these days
That's not a human being, listen...

15
00:03:08,081 --> 00:03:09,280
It started.

16
00:03:10,601 --> 00:03:12,120
Go for it!

17
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,321
Not so loud.

18
00:03:14,841 --> 00:03:17,880
Go for it!

19
00:03:35,001 --> 00:03:36,080
Wait.

20
00:03:37,241 --> 00:03:38,640
Wait, wait.

21
00:03:38,841 --> 00:03:40,241
Your water bottle!

22
00:03:41,561 --> 00:03:45,641
The bottom kids support gymnastic
formations, so hang in there.

23
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,561
Off you go.

24
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,040
Over the white line,
you go to hell.

25
00:03:53,321 --> 00:03:55,080
That was when I was a kid.

26
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:58,240
You still are.

27
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,321
Excuse me.

28
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,520
Yes, welcome.

29
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,320
Welcome I'll take care of it.

30
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,601
I just passed it, and
it was completely burned.

31
00:04:29,721 --> 00:04:31,080
Well, you know,

32
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:33,680
I could hear the fire trucks
until after 1am.

33
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,720
There was a hostess bar on the third floor
Did you know?

34
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,880
I saw a girl in short skirt
handing out tissues to promote it.

35
00:04:41,201 --> 00:04:44,760
And according to what I heard,

36
00:04:45,121 --> 00:04:46,841
Mr. Hori was there.

37
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,000
A teacher in a hostess bar...

38
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:55,481
Is he lonely?

39
00:04:55,601 --> 00:04:58,481
Word gets around fast
about something like that.

40
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:01,161
I'm tired.

41
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,720
Minato?

42
00:05:04,361 --> 00:05:05,561
In the bathroom?

43
00:05:06,521 --> 00:05:08,681
Sorry, I'll make dinner right away.

44
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,520
What?
Oh, no, what the...

45
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,080
What are you doing?

46
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,161
- What, what?
- I'm naked.

47
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,760
What, what are you up to?

48
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,521
Against school rules.

49
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,001
About your curly hair?

50
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,120
Was it Kamata?
Did he say something again?

51
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,321
What the hell is this?

52
00:05:43,601 --> 00:05:46,841
- Hello.
- Manager, customer.

53
00:05:56,001 --> 00:05:57,521
I'm home.

54
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,080
<i>Here goes,</i>

55
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,760
<i>Happy birthday to you,</i>

56
00:06:14,921 --> 00:06:17,480
<i>Happy birthday to you.</i>

57
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,801
<i>Happy birthday, dear Father.</i>

58
00:06:20,921 --> 00:06:24,001
<i>Happy birthday, to you.</i>

59
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,680
Enough.

60
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,241
Blow them out.

61
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,080
The cake got smaller again
Dad would have eaten it in two bites.

62
00:06:36,201 --> 00:06:38,361
He won't eat it,
he's already dead.

63
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,081
He can hear you.

64
00:06:42,281 --> 00:06:43,881
Give him an update.

65
00:06:44,001 --> 00:06:48,001
About school and
about your friends.

66
00:06:49,241 --> 00:06:50,601
Out loud.

67
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,960
Did they throw dirt over him
in his grave?

68
00:06:55,241 --> 00:06:58,640
He was cremated first,
so there was no dirt.

69
00:06:59,561 --> 00:07:01,121
Is he already reborn?

70
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,840
Then I wish he'd come see us.

71
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,560
What if he's reborn as a stink bug?

72
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,960
He's reborn into something more noble.

73
00:07:10,081 --> 00:07:11,160
Like a giraffe?

74
00:07:11,801 --> 00:07:13,160
I'd have to look up at him.

75
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,801
Meet him on the veranda.

76
00:07:17,801 --> 00:07:20,481
I prefer a horse.

77
00:07:21,601 --> 00:07:23,400
He liked horses,

78
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,040
and he could give us rides.

79
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,400
Give him an update.

80
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,280
If I talk to him, you can hear me, too.

81
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,960
Got it.

82
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,000
What is it?

83
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,241
Go see the doctor?

84
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,721
Will you be OK?

85
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,081
Time to get up and get ready.

86
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,240
OK?

87
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,921
An experiment.

88
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,360
For Science.

89
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,081
Wait for me, I'm hungry!

90
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,080
What time did Gaku last see him?

91
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,400
He was riding his bike?
Where?

92
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,081
What?

93
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,360
Minato?

94
00:09:52,001 --> 00:09:54,960
I'M HERE.

95
00:10:17,561 --> 00:10:19,760
Who's the monster?

96
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,321
Who's the monster?

97
00:10:26,921 --> 00:10:28,280
Minato?

98
00:10:29,481 --> 00:10:31,880
- Who's the...
- Minato!

99
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,920
Minato!

100
00:10:52,641 --> 00:10:53,641
Sorry.

101
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,200
Your ear hurt?

102
00:10:58,481 --> 00:10:59,561
I...

103
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:01,841
be like Dad.

104
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,161
Your father was much worse.

105
00:11:07,601 --> 00:11:09,401
He was a rugby player.

106
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,721
He'd come home with a complex
fracture like it was no big deal.

107
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,120
But I've promised your father.

108
00:11:18,441 --> 00:11:22,361
That I'll hang in there until you're
married and have your own family.

109
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:29,001
Just an ordinary family
you see anywhere is fine.

110
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,840
Until you have your own family,
the greatest treasure...

111
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,041
Minato?

112
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,361
Minato!

113
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:02,441
Mugino Minato.

114
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,521
Come to the exam room.

115
00:12:04,761 --> 00:12:05,801
Let's go.

116
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,241
Come in.

117
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,440
Please, come in.

118
00:12:18,201 --> 00:12:19,640
You'll be fine.

119
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,641
Let's just have them take a look.

120
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,120
Please wait outside for your son.

121
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:11,880
Can't we get the car back?

122
00:13:13,361 --> 00:13:17,640
If we can't, I'll go crazy
at the police station.

123
00:13:20,481 --> 00:13:21,521
Don't worry.

124
00:13:26,921 --> 00:13:28,722
Mom, did you...

125
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,560
see the X-rays?

126
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,561
The CT scan? Sure.

127
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,480
Everything looked normal.

128
00:13:38,881 --> 00:13:40,481
Oops, I'm in hell.

129
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,440
You're really fine.

130
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,401
Nothing's wrong with you.

131
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,001
What is it?

132
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,200
What's up?

133
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,480
Did something happen at school?

134
00:14:04,601 --> 00:14:06,080
That you're a slow eater?

135
00:14:11,321 --> 00:14:13,361
Why did you cut your hair?

136
00:14:15,161 --> 00:14:17,201
Why did you lose your sneaker?

137
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,120
What happened here?

138
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,040
It's a pig's brain
My brain was switched with a pig's.

139
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,800
That's what's strange about me,

140
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:36,201
I'm a monster...

141
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,121
Who told you that?

142
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,200
Was it Kamata?
It was Kamata, right?

143
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,641
Who told you that!

144
00:14:53,681 --> 00:14:55,920
Minato, who told you that!

145
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:00,881
Who said that?

146
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,360
Mr. Hori.

147
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:53,321
- Bye.
- Bye.

148
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,560
Principal...

149
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:01,001
I had been using this at home.

150
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,601
Bye.

151
00:16:04,361 --> 00:16:06,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

152
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,800
I'm fifth grader Mugino Minato's mother.

153
00:16:13,961 --> 00:16:16,400
His gym bag was thrown down the hall,

154
00:16:18,281 --> 00:16:22,081
or not allowed to eat lunch
because he wasn't prepared for class.

155
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,560
He's told me these things.

156
00:16:25,761 --> 00:16:27,000
Yes.

157
00:16:27,801 --> 00:16:30,480
His ear was pulled so hard it bled.

158
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,481
He said, "Mr. Hori, stop,
it hurts,".

159
00:16:36,201 --> 00:16:38,560
Mr. Hori told him,
"Your brain is a pig's brain,

160
00:16:39,161 --> 00:16:41,520
you won't learn until it really hurts".

161
00:16:43,841 --> 00:16:44,841
Yes.

162
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,601
Sorry we're late.

163
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,241
Ms. Mugino, it's been awhile
I was his second grade...

164
00:16:58,361 --> 00:17:00,640
Mr. Kanzaki, hello.

165
00:17:01,161 --> 00:17:02,401
And now?

166
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,680
I teach first graders...

167
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,201
That must be tough.

168
00:17:05,321 --> 00:17:06,680
A war zone.

169
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,801
Please sit down.

170
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,521
Please.

171
00:17:17,441 --> 00:17:20,681
- Please share your concerns.
- I just explained to the principal...

172
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,120
The principal has pressing business.

173
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:28,361
But it's about a student
What other business...

174
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,360
The principal recently

175
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,280
lost her grandchild in an accident.

176
00:17:33,401 --> 00:17:36,480
It's an appointment about that,
but if you insist...

177
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,641
No.

178
00:17:38,921 --> 00:17:40,801
I'm sorry, I didn't know...

179
00:17:42,721 --> 00:17:43,721
<i>Ouch!</i>

180
00:17:44,441 --> 00:17:46,160
<i>Ouch! What, what?</i>

181
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,680
<i>And here's how we tricked her.</i>

182
00:17:52,601 --> 00:17:56,561
Maybe it's faked
Would you get tricked that easily?

183
00:17:57,081 --> 00:17:59,160
You know it's a lie because
it's on TV.

184
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,841
<i>My skin's super supple!</i>

185
00:18:04,241 --> 00:18:06,721
Super supple!

186
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:32,840

00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,000
We've kept you waiting.

188
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,281
Regarding

189
00:19:18,521 --> 00:19:22,160
the concerns that you shared with us,

190
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:26,960
Mr. Hori would like to
offer you an apology.

191
00:19:30,641 --> 00:19:31,800
Stand up.

192
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,960
In this case,
because my instruction,

193
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:44,561
toward Mugino, to Mugino,

194
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,000
resulted in a misunderstanding

195
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,920
I feel most regretful.

196
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,641
I do formally apologize.

197
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,360
And, so?

198
00:20:02,681 --> 00:20:05,640
- We are terribly sorry.
- That's not right.

199
00:20:05,761 --> 00:20:08,280
This isn't right at all.

200
00:20:09,161 --> 00:20:10,961
Please, please wait.

201
00:20:11,481 --> 00:20:12,720
You see,

202
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,720
can't we all sit down?

203
00:20:16,961 --> 00:20:18,241
Please sit down.

204
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,601
My son...

205
00:20:32,641 --> 00:20:35,680
was wounded by
his teacher's cruel remark.

206
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:37,760
It wasn't a misunderstanding.

207
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:42,000
We believe his instruction
was not accurately conveyed.

208
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,040
What instruction?

209
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,920
Which one?

210
00:20:47,561 --> 00:20:52,280
We believe his instruction
required the utmost attention.

211
00:20:52,801 --> 00:20:55,641
May I confirm, Mr. Hori?

212
00:20:57,321 --> 00:20:58,561
Mr. Hori!

213
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,321
You were violent towards
my son, right?

214
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,880
It seems there was
a misunderstanding.

215
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,640
There was no misunderstanding...

216
00:21:09,921 --> 00:21:13,800
My son was wounded
because this teacher hit him.

217
00:21:15,761 --> 00:21:17,120
Do you understand?

218
00:21:17,441 --> 00:21:19,760
We accept your opinion
with seriousness

219
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:24,360
and we will provide
appropriate instruction in the future.

220
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,241
So,

221
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,720
did you hit him?
Or didn't you hit him?

222
00:21:34,481 --> 00:21:36,440
Please answer yes or no.

223
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,400
Now.

224
00:21:39,281 --> 00:21:40,440
Now!

225
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,521
We have confirmed

226
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,680
that there was contact

227
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:50,640
between the teacher's hand
and Mugino Minato's nose.

228
00:21:51,641 --> 00:21:53,321
That means you hit him.

229
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,320
There was contact between
the hand and the nose.

230
00:21:59,081 --> 00:22:00,120
The hand?

231
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:04,721
And the nose contacting
like this?

232
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,840
Twisting his arm,

233
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,800
and pulling his ear,
is a lot more than contact.

234
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,201
What did you put in your mouth?

235
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:23,160
Candy?

236
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,120
Why's he eating candy?

237
00:22:30,681 --> 00:22:31,920
Do you,

238
00:22:33,321 --> 00:22:35,400
understand what we're
talking about now?

239
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:39,081
This is typical of single mothers
like mine, so I know...

240
00:22:39,201 --> 00:22:40,440
Mr. Hori.

241
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,880
What about single mothers?

242
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,681
They tend to worry too much...

243
00:22:44,801 --> 00:22:46,920
You're saying I'm overprotective?

244
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:49,040
We accept your opinion
with seriousness

245
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,920
and we will provide
appropriate instruction in the future

246
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,280
I hope you can understand.

247
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,361
Mr. Hori.

248
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,121
I am terribly sorry.

249
00:23:27,401 --> 00:23:29,440
You'll get scolded.

250
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,561
What are you doing!

251
00:23:38,681 --> 00:23:41,681
You can't run like that
Be careful.

252
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,720
Hurry, go pick it up.

253
00:23:56,681 --> 00:23:59,640
I'm getting sesame oil
at the convenience store.

254
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,201
Sorry, I'm late
We got a watermelon...

255
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,041
What are you doing?

256
00:24:24,681 --> 00:24:26,360
I dropped my eraser.

257
00:24:35,201 --> 00:24:36,481
Do you have a fever?

258
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,760
Did your teacher say something again?

259
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,521
- Hello.
- Hello.

260
00:25:23,081 --> 00:25:27,201
We will reconfirm the facts...

261
00:25:27,321 --> 00:25:31,001
Now! Confirm them now!
I mean, I'm asking.

262
00:25:31,161 --> 00:25:33,320
- Yes.
- Don't "Yes" me.

263
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,200
Well...

264
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,601
I didn't ask you to change
"Yes" to "Well".

265
00:25:42,681 --> 00:25:45,360
At this rate, I'll have to transfer him
to another school.

266
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,441
You were a good teacher.

267
00:25:52,161 --> 00:25:56,081
On parents' day in second grade,
Minato read his composition.

268
00:25:56,841 --> 00:25:59,360
That his dream was to become
a single mother.

269
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,480
I think he wrote that

270
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:06,681
because I raise him alone
and he wanted to help me.

271
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,800
Everyone in his class
burst out laughing.

272
00:26:11,921 --> 00:26:14,480
But you didn't laugh.

273
00:26:15,401 --> 00:26:17,801
"Be kind to your mother,"

274
00:26:18,641 --> 00:26:21,440
is what he said while praising Minato.

275
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,400
So I don't think all the teachers
in this school are awful,

276
00:26:26,681 --> 00:26:30,000
but I do know that the person
at the top is the worst.

277
00:26:31,241 --> 00:26:34,001
You don't have a human heart!

278
00:26:35,321 --> 00:26:36,920
I'm sorry...

279
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,681
That's not it.

280
00:26:39,401 --> 00:26:42,320
I'm not asking for an apology.

281
00:26:43,041 --> 00:26:44,921
Please have Mr. Hori come here.

282
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,481
Unfortunately he's out

283
00:26:49,601 --> 00:26:51,761
I just saw him over there.

284
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,401
Principal, you just lied to me.

285
00:26:55,681 --> 00:26:58,080
You just said he's out.

286
00:26:58,281 --> 00:27:02,280
When a teacher is out, it doesn't mean
he's not at school...

287
00:27:02,401 --> 00:27:04,321
Get it together!

288
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:13,120
You know...

289
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,521
I don't see any life
in any of your eyes.

290
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,921
Am I talking to human beings?

291
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,681
Yes.

292
00:27:29,081 --> 00:27:32,161
Can you please answer my question?

293
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,680
About whether we're human?

294
00:27:37,921 --> 00:27:39,240
No.

295
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,401
Fine, just answer that.

296
00:27:51,081 --> 00:27:53,001
You have to check your notes?

297
00:27:56,801 --> 00:27:58,200
We're human.

298
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,160
In that case,

299
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,081
I'm here because I'm worried
about my child.

300
00:28:06,281 --> 00:28:09,680
Could you please deal with me
as a fellow human being?

301
00:28:12,881 --> 00:28:14,520
Just for this meeting,

302
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,800
please.

303
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:24,801
We accept your opinion
with seriousness and believe...

304
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,800
I'm sorry.

305
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,441
Thank you.

306
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,841
This is really not a good time.

307
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,040
She's here now...

308
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,441
Please wait.

309
00:28:58,281 --> 00:28:59,680
Let's go over there.

310
00:28:59,801 --> 00:29:02,921
Um, we should go...

311
00:29:03,081 --> 00:29:06,000
- Fine, I'll apologize.
- It's not...

312
00:29:07,161 --> 00:29:08,681
I'm very sorry.

313
00:29:09,161 --> 00:29:12,041
A teacher with a school like...

314
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,320
I can't send my child to a school
with a teacher like this.

315
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,560
Make him quit.

316
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,600
- Did I say something amusing?
- Bye.

317
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,800
- Did I say something funny?
- Don't get so excited

318
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,161
I'm not excited, just asking for...

319
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,280
Your son is a bully.

320
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,080
What are you saying?

321
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,681
Mugino Minato is bullying
Hoshikawa Yori.

322
00:29:39,801 --> 00:29:42,041
- There's no evidence.
- Mr. Hori, take it back.

323
00:29:42,161 --> 00:29:45,760
Does Mugino have a knife or
a weapon at home?

324
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,640
What are you talking about?

325
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:51,800
You're full of crap
You were at that hostess bar.

326
00:29:52,321 --> 00:29:53,720
Oh, I know.

327
00:29:54,041 --> 00:29:56,681
You set fire to that bar
You're the arson?

328
00:29:56,801 --> 00:29:59,400
You're the one with a pig's brain
in your head.

329
00:30:00,281 --> 00:30:03,240
DO NOT ENTER.

330
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,121
You really did it.

331
00:30:25,361 --> 00:30:26,801
Watermelon.

332
00:30:30,681 --> 00:30:32,481
It happens, it does.

333
00:30:32,921 --> 00:30:34,481
It's a release.

334
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,281
A release.

335
00:31:41,681 --> 00:31:42,761
Yes?

336
00:31:44,201 --> 00:31:45,601
You're Hoshikawa?

337
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,880
Yes.

338
00:31:49,001 --> 00:31:50,520
Hoshikawa Yori?

339
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,640
Yes.

340
00:31:53,681 --> 00:31:55,680
You're Minato's friend, right?

341
00:31:56,121 --> 00:31:57,280
Yes.

342
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,801
Please.

343
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,881
Please, come in.

344
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,120
Please.

345
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,361
This looks like Minato's sneaker.

346
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,161
Yeah, he loaned it to me.

347
00:32:16,281 --> 00:32:17,520
Just the one?

348
00:32:18,081 --> 00:32:19,320
Just the one.

349
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,520
Is your mother not at home?

350
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,801
Won't she get mad,
letting a stranger in your house?

351
00:32:26,921 --> 00:32:28,761
It's fine.

352
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,840
Is Mugino still sick with a cold?

353
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,561
Yeah...

354
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,040
Write a letter?

355
00:32:38,801 --> 00:32:40,800
Like we write to kids out sick.

356
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,521
How is

357
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,320
your cold?

358
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:57,120
Listen,

359
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,801
We are all worried

360
00:33:03,161 --> 00:33:04,440
about...

361
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,960
Yori, here,

362
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:11,240
this letter here is flipped.

363
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,841
You wrote this backwards.

364
00:33:32,561 --> 00:33:33,600
Here.

365
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,521
Thank you, say, this...

366
00:33:36,961 --> 00:33:38,160
What happened?

367
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,880
Is it a burn?

368
00:33:51,161 --> 00:33:52,760
Yori,

369
00:33:53,001 --> 00:33:57,240
are you being bullied at school?

370
00:34:07,401 --> 00:34:13,600
According to Mr. Hori,
Mugino often mistreats you...

371
00:34:13,721 --> 00:34:16,520
I've never been bullied by Mugino.

372
00:34:16,841 --> 00:34:19,481
- What are you saying...
- And Mr. Hori...

373
00:34:19,601 --> 00:34:21,480
OK, thanks, let's go back to class.

374
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,280
What about the teacher?

375
00:34:23,921 --> 00:34:26,480
He's always hitting Mugino.

376
00:34:26,601 --> 00:34:28,400
What is that?

377
00:34:28,761 --> 00:34:32,681
The other kids all know, but keep quiet
because they're afraid of him.

378
00:34:33,521 --> 00:34:36,000
- Let's go back to class.
- Back to class.

379
00:34:41,655 --> 00:34:42,695
Hoshikawa?

380
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,521
Don't run away, Principal.

381
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:49,400
You lost your grandchild,
didn't you?

382
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,601
I heard about it.

383
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,920
Your husband was parking his car

384
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,121
and ran over your grandchild
behind the car.

385
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,280
Did it make you sad?

386
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,040
Did it make you grieve?

387
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:13,680
That's exactly how I feel now.

388
00:35:34,001 --> 00:35:35,041
Good morning.

389
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:39,320
Saori, Saori.

390
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,041
You've had it rough.

391
00:35:44,361 --> 00:35:46,281
Unfortunately,

392
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:50,361
something happened
that should never have happened.

393
00:35:52,361 --> 00:35:53,681
Mr. Hori.

394
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:13,520
I inflicted violence on fifth grader,
Mugino Minato.

395
00:36:14,401 --> 00:36:17,360
I hit Mugino's face
I twisted his arm

396
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:20,400
I also used terrible words with him.

397
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:30,641
TEACHER PHYSICALLY PUNISHES
"PIG BRAIN" STUDENT.

398
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,521
Good bye.

399
00:36:36,401 --> 00:36:39,641
- The stairs, he fell from the stairs?
- We're not sure...

400
00:36:39,761 --> 00:36:41,921
He fell running from Hori...

401
00:36:42,041 --> 00:36:43,041
Let's go

402
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,440
Mr. Hori?
Why's he here?

403
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,120
Didn't he quit?

404
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,560
Why's he here?

405
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,560
- Minato fell down the stairs.
- Shut up, go home.

406
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,241
Eel keeper!

407
00:36:55,521 --> 00:36:57,441
- Where is he?
- Go home!

408
00:36:57,561 --> 00:37:00,120
- The Guidance Counseling Room.
- Eel keeper!

409
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,400
Minato?

410
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,881
What?

411
00:37:07,721 --> 00:37:09,480
He was just here.

412
00:37:10,881 --> 00:37:13,641
No, no, no.

413
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,880
No, no, no.

414
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,281
It's OK.

415
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:29,081
Don't worry, it's fine.

416
00:37:33,401 --> 00:37:36,160
Enough...

417
00:37:46,241 --> 00:37:47,760
We're going, Gaku.

418
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,401
He was in the bathroom.

419
00:38:30,761 --> 00:38:34,281
<i>...typhoon, 50 kms south of
Yakushima, heading north,</i>

420
00:38:34,401 --> 00:38:37,841
<i>expected to land on
southern Kagoshima soon.</i>

421
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,001
I saw Dad...

422
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,160
He asked me to tell you.

423
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,521
Did he appear in a dream?

424
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,241
He said, "Thank you for everything,
I love you".

425
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,041
I'm just no good.

426
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:42,401
I feel like I don't take care of you
and I feel sorry for you.

427
00:39:52,361 --> 00:39:54,241
Do you think Dad's reborn?

428
00:39:56,801 --> 00:39:58,481
Maybe.

429
00:40:04,641 --> 00:40:06,761
I wonder what I'll be reborn as.

430
00:40:08,201 --> 00:40:11,081
But you're still totally alive, Minato.

431
00:40:11,561 --> 00:40:12,600
Yeah...

432
00:40:13,841 --> 00:40:15,720
Don't talk like that.

433
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,600
Mom,

434
00:40:25,361 --> 00:40:27,161
don't feel sorry for me.

435
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,561
Mugino!

436
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,080
Mugino!

437
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,921
Mugino!

438
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,520
Mugino!

439
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,600
MONSTER

440
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,440
What's wrong?

441
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,600
What did you say?

442
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,001
Let's get married.

443
00:42:22,121 --> 00:42:25,601
That's a proposal,
you're supposed to make it

444
00:42:25,721 --> 00:42:28,160
somewhere with a beautiful view
of the night.

445
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,441
Night view?

446
00:42:31,241 --> 00:42:35,321
Everybody says it's beautiful,
but it's just lightbulbs.

447
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,720
It's bad
The whole thing's on fire.

448
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:55,200
Kamata, Hamaguchi,
what are you doing?

449
00:42:56,601 --> 00:42:57,881
It's Hori.

450
00:42:58,001 --> 00:43:01,040
- Stop filming me!
- Girl from the hostess bar!

451
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:04,400
Hirohashi, you too, go home.

452
00:43:05,121 --> 00:43:06,121
Burning crazy!

453
00:43:06,201 --> 00:43:08,081
- Taking her home!
- Gross!

454
00:43:08,561 --> 00:43:10,520
It'll burn the whole building down.

455
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,241
I wonder if they all went home...

456
00:43:28,161 --> 00:43:31,481
It's like you, Hori
I feel sorry for it.

457
00:43:32,561 --> 00:43:34,761
Don't feel sorry for me.

458
00:43:37,721 --> 00:43:39,521
It has swim bladder disease.

459
00:43:40,801 --> 00:43:42,240
Don't be rude,

460
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,360
my mind and body are healthy.

461
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:49,560
Says someone whose hobby is sending
letters about typos to publishers?

462
00:43:56,561 --> 00:43:58,121
Look at this.

463
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:03,600
I wonder what "fish" fell from my eyes,
a yellowtail or a sardine.

464
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:06,120
Can't you find a hobby
that's more fun?

465
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,000
It makes me squirm with joy.

466
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:12,360
When you're having fun,
your face is scary

467
00:44:12,481 --> 00:44:14,640
I bet your students are put off, too.

468
00:44:18,201 --> 00:44:19,560
Try smiling.

469
00:44:22,121 --> 00:44:24,720
Your smile is so stiff,
you'll make children cry.

470
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,481
And make flowers wilt.

471
00:44:32,561 --> 00:44:37,441
Stop trying to act like you're a good
teacher and just be yourself.

472
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,760
You don't have condoms.

473
00:44:43,881 --> 00:44:45,881
It'll be fine.

474
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:49,040
Don't you teach at school

475
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:53,280
not to trust a woman's "Next time"
and a man's "It'll be fine?"

476
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:57,960
It'll be fine.

477
00:44:58,841 --> 00:45:00,441
Next time, then.

478
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,761
Watch your hands, hey.

479
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,641
- Morning.
- Morning.

480
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,841
Did you eat all your breakfast?

481
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:17,840
What did you eat?

482
00:45:21,601 --> 00:45:23,241
Corn soup and bread.

483
00:45:23,361 --> 00:45:26,401
- Sounds tasty.
- I ate soft noodles.

484
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:28,001
Soft noodles.

485
00:45:29,001 --> 00:45:30,560
What's up, Hoshikawa?

486
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:32,921
Good morning, my shoe fell off.

487
00:45:34,961 --> 00:45:36,001
Here.

488
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,641
Thank you.

489
00:45:45,881 --> 00:45:48,441
I'm waiting for the parents
to schedule a meeting.

490
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:51,240
You'd better be careful.

491
00:45:51,361 --> 00:45:54,840
They're more trouble
than their kids, these days.

492
00:45:55,201 --> 00:45:57,401
Do some parents always complain?

493
00:45:57,521 --> 00:46:01,560
They're monsters
Teachers are being crucified, these days.

494
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:05,640
Hey, little eel.

495
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,961
Oh, Principal.

496
00:46:11,521 --> 00:46:15,361
I am resuming my duties as of today.

497
00:46:15,761 --> 00:46:20,760
Thank you for all of your
kind notes while I was away.

498
00:46:26,801 --> 00:46:30,320
Today, on April 25th,

499
00:46:30,441 --> 00:46:33,561
physical measurements and
eye exams for sixth graders.

500
00:46:34,521 --> 00:46:37,841
I took time off just when
you started teaching here.

501
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:39,041
Don't...

502
00:46:39,201 --> 00:46:41,640
Please take good care of your students.

503
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:42,800
Yes.

504
00:46:47,841 --> 00:46:51,360
"Like player Nomo, who didn't fear
public opposition when

505
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:55,840
"he joined Major League Baseball,
I also declare.

506
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:59,040
"Practicing my swing on
a West Coast beach,

507
00:46:59,321 --> 00:47:01,200
"I've been reborn

508
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:06,241
"I solemnly swear,
I will marry the idol Nishida Hikaru

509
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:08,921
"Fifth Grader, Hori Michitoshi."

510
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,401
- Hey, Tanaka, class is starting.
- Oh, bathroom.

511
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,160
No need to rush.

512
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,641
I have

513
00:47:34,081 --> 00:47:37,280
attended two weddings
of women I once loved.

514
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,320
Will the kids find it funny?

515
00:47:41,201 --> 00:47:43,800
Sounds like a stalker
when you say it.

516
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:47,921
Save your obsessions
for the hostess bar.

517
00:47:58,361 --> 00:47:59,841
Mugino, hey!

518
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:01,560
What are you doing?

519
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,681
Mugino, stop!

520
00:48:05,761 --> 00:48:07,641
I'm sorry, you OK?

521
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,040
You OK?

522
00:48:11,521 --> 00:48:13,200
Why do you do this?

523
00:48:14,321 --> 00:48:16,520
What happened? Why?

524
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,001
Playing around?

525
00:48:20,001 --> 00:48:21,480
Pissed off.

526
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:23,640
Pissed off?

527
00:48:24,641 --> 00:48:28,361
How do you think they feel having
their things thrown like this.

528
00:48:31,961 --> 00:48:33,000
How do they feel?

529
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,321
Don't like it.

530
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:37,680
Right?

531
00:48:38,401 --> 00:48:40,281
Let's apologize to them.

532
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,280
I'm sorry.

533
00:48:47,921 --> 00:48:50,280
- Oh, no, nosebleed.
- Nosebleed.

534
00:48:52,601 --> 00:48:56,280
His mom is a single mother
That's why.

535
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,361
My mom was, too.

536
00:48:58,481 --> 00:49:02,201
She becomes overprotective
with a shrewd perspective.

537
00:49:02,321 --> 00:49:06,881
You're using "shrewd perspective"
in the wrong way.

538
00:49:07,241 --> 00:49:10,160
It actually means
perceiving the essence of things...

539
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:15,360
When things are tough,
don't take yourself so seriously.

540
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:20,201
Do you even remember your elementary
school teacher's name?

541
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:23,120
- No.
- See?

542
00:49:23,241 --> 00:49:26,121
They're going to forget you,
so don't take it too seriously.

543
00:49:29,561 --> 00:49:32,520
I get off early tomorrow,
so let's meet up and go shopping.

544
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:41,920
- Shut up.
- Don't say that

545
00:49:42,041 --> 00:49:43,200
Second tier.

546
00:49:44,921 --> 00:49:46,800
Hang in there, hang in.

547
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:48,600
Hang in.

548
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,480
OK, third tier!

549
00:49:52,121 --> 00:49:55,640
Oh, hang in there, first tier
Don't sway, second tier.

550
00:49:58,041 --> 00:50:00,360
You call yourself a man?

551
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,681
Again, from the second tier

552
00:50:02,841 --> 00:50:06,441
<i>5pm by the station.</i>

553
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,360
Found him, here he is.

554
00:50:25,641 --> 00:50:26,681
Ouch.

555
00:50:29,721 --> 00:50:32,321
Mugino Minato's guardian
is here to protest.

556
00:50:32,441 --> 00:50:34,040
Protest what?

557
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,640
You're shifty-eyed and creepy,
so stay here

558
00:50:36,761 --> 00:50:39,680
I haven't done anything
I can explain it to her.

559
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:42,120
We can't let this get out of hand.

560
00:50:42,241 --> 00:50:45,240
We're used to dealing with guardians,
leave it to us.

561
00:50:46,041 --> 00:50:47,160
Leave it.

562
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:52,121
You may not know,
but Mugino's father died...

563
00:50:52,241 --> 00:50:53,840
I know that, but what does...

564
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:56,921
In the parents' meeting,
did she say he'll test for middle school?

565
00:50:57,041 --> 00:50:58,241
Yes, she did.

566
00:50:58,361 --> 00:51:02,201
If he has to transfer for bullying,
he can't test for any school.

567
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:08,201
I didn't hit him
My arm just grazed him.

568
00:51:09,121 --> 00:51:11,961
I can explain that I stopped
Mugino from acting out.

569
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:15,000
If you blame the child,
the parent will become furious.

570
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:19,681
If this gets to the Education Board,
the whole school will be punished.

571
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,881
- Maybe all of us...
- But actually...

572
00:51:22,001 --> 00:51:25,600
What actually happened
doesn't matter.

573
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:31,241
Start over.

574
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,761
Because my instruction...

575
00:51:34,721 --> 00:51:36,761
- Well...
- No "Well" needed.

576
00:51:37,601 --> 00:51:40,601
Sit in the guardian's seat.

577
00:51:45,441 --> 00:51:46,800
Can you see this?

578
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:49,320
Yes, I can see it perfectly.

579
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:53,760
Mr. Hori?

580
00:51:55,201 --> 00:51:56,400
Mr. Hori?

581
00:51:58,121 --> 00:52:01,881
In this case, because
my instruction to Mugino...

582
00:52:05,761 --> 00:52:09,161
She placed the photo like this
and said, "can you see it?"

583
00:52:10,401 --> 00:52:14,681
The principal does love this school.

584
00:52:15,321 --> 00:52:16,721
But still...

585
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,520
She lives in my neighborhood.

586
00:52:22,961 --> 00:52:27,521
There's a rumor that it was
actually the principal's fault.

587
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,161
What?

588
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:40,001
That it wasn't her husband
who ran over their grandchild,

589
00:52:40,161 --> 00:52:43,041
but it was the principal herself.

590
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:25,880
Hoshikawa.

591
00:53:26,321 --> 00:53:29,321
There they were
Thank you, Mr. Hori.

592
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:09,240
What is it?

593
00:54:12,441 --> 00:54:16,161
Excuse me, I'm Hori
I'm Yori's homeroom teacher.

594
00:54:16,281 --> 00:54:17,440
His teacher.

595
00:54:18,081 --> 00:54:20,640
I wanted to talk to you about him.

596
00:54:20,841 --> 00:54:22,081
Your college?

597
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:23,520
Excuse me?

598
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:29,081
I hear teachers don't get paid much.

599
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:33,920
Do you know Mega-City Real Estate?

600
00:54:35,481 --> 00:54:36,840
I used to work there

601
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:38,560
I see, amazing.

602
00:54:40,961 --> 00:54:42,881
It's not amazing, but

603
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:48,281
maybe for an elementary
school teacher.

604
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:50,280
Um...

605
00:54:50,881 --> 00:54:53,681
- About Yori.
- I'm sure he's a pain,

606
00:54:53,801 --> 00:54:57,641
you don't have to tell me about him
I'll take responsibility for him.

607
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:00,761
He's not a pain, he's a great kid.

608
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,520
No good,

609
00:55:02,921 --> 00:55:04,080
he's...

610
00:55:06,241 --> 00:55:07,721
A monster.

611
00:55:08,201 --> 00:55:09,280
What?

612
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:13,001
His brain isn't a human brain,
it's a pig's brain.

613
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:16,241
Which is why I plan to

614
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:19,481
turn him back into a human.

615
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,520
- Hello.
- Hello.

616
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,320
Did you pee?

617
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:59,120
Who's the monster?

618
00:56:00,921 --> 00:56:02,201
Are you OK?

619
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,280
Are you...

620
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,480
- Hoshikawa?
- Oh, it's you, Mr. Hori.

621
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:21,680
Thanks.

622
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,880
- Hello.
- Hello.

623
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:53,801
When I found it,
it was already cold.

624
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,080
The cat?

625
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:58,760
I saw it.

626
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:02,760
I saw Mugino toying with the cat.

627
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:14,601
Hoshikawa?

628
00:57:14,721 --> 00:57:16,320
- Hey, Hoshikawa?
- No!

629
00:57:19,681 --> 00:57:21,080
Kida, come here.

630
00:57:22,361 --> 00:57:26,960
Can you please tell the Principal
what you told me the other day?

631
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:32,561
That Mugino might have
killed the cat?

632
00:57:32,801 --> 00:57:35,041
What? I never said that.

633
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:36,281
What...

634
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:38,601
Why do you tell lies?

635
00:57:38,721 --> 00:57:40,601
- What are you doing!
- Hurts.

636
00:57:47,081 --> 00:57:49,640
Did everyone get a copy?

637
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:54,881
This questionnaire will be filled out
by all the fifth graders.

638
00:57:55,001 --> 00:57:58,520
- So, all homeroom teachers need to...
- What is this?

639
00:57:58,640 --> 00:57:59,640
Return...

640
00:57:59,721 --> 00:58:01,080
What is this?

641
00:58:03,161 --> 00:58:05,960
What is this!
What is this!

642
00:58:06,561 --> 00:58:08,840
Ms. Mugino has hired a lawyer.

643
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:13,721
It arrived by certified delivery.

644
00:58:20,121 --> 00:58:21,121
Bathroom, bathroom.

645
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:23,081
Really think about it.

646
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,641
And write down

647
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:26,960
your honest answer.

648
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:34,200
HAVE YOU EVER FELT AFRAID
OF MR. HORI?

649
00:58:36,161 --> 00:58:39,020
DID HE EVER SCREAM AT YOU OR GRAB...
YES

650
00:58:46,361 --> 00:58:48,521
I really haven't done anything.

651
00:58:49,961 --> 00:58:51,281
I'm sure.

652
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:53,880
In that case, please stop this.

653
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,041
If you object now,
it will only strengthen their case.

654
00:58:57,161 --> 00:58:58,601
Then why didn't you...

655
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:02,121
You are going to defend our school.

656
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:09,680
Let's go, Mr. Hori.

657
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:41,321
A long day for you.

658
00:59:47,481 --> 00:59:49,441
Who actually drove that car?

659
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:02,321
You're the principal, so to protect
your position and your name,

660
01:00:02,801 --> 01:00:05,040
you made your husband
take the blame.

661
01:00:17,921 --> 01:00:21,041
The principal and everyone
told me to apologize anyway.

662
01:00:21,161 --> 01:00:22,920
My apology would satisfy everyone.

663
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:26,601
So I had no choice
and even apologized to Mugino.

664
01:00:26,826 --> 01:00:27,831
But...

665
01:00:27,881 --> 01:00:29,721
Have you been busy, recently?

666
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:33,240
Well, I still have some work
to do later.

667
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:36,201
Good evening.

668
01:00:37,961 --> 01:00:41,400
You're Mr. Hori, the teacher
at Johoku Elementary, right?

669
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:45,521
I see you went shopping.

670
01:00:49,601 --> 01:00:51,920
- I'm sorry.
- Please stop that.

671
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:55,401
I'd like to interview you.

672
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:56,641
Please stop that.

673
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:05,600
I think they left.

674
01:01:08,961 --> 01:01:10,961
They were taking your picture.

675
01:01:17,801 --> 01:01:19,160
Why the pajamas?

676
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:22,640
Why aren't you staying over?

677
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:25,640
No reason,
you've got a lot going on

678
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:28,520
I'm fine
A lot of things happened, but...

679
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:31,241
I wasn't in the photos they took,
was I?

680
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:33,401
Even so, I'll be the only one
in the newspaper

681
01:01:33,521 --> 01:01:35,081
I'm sorry.

682
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:36,320
That hurt.

683
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:38,201
You know I'm innocent, right?

684
01:01:38,321 --> 01:01:41,640
I know that, hang in there.

685
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:43,440
See you next time.

686
01:02:27,401 --> 01:02:30,600
"PIG'S BRAIN"
ABUSIVE TEACHER'S TAUNT.

687
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:45,200
Pig's brain! Pig's brain!

688
01:02:59,081 --> 01:03:01,281
It's Hori.

689
01:03:07,041 --> 01:03:08,081
Mugino.

690
01:03:09,881 --> 01:03:12,041
Mugino.

691
01:03:15,281 --> 01:03:16,680
Mugino!

692
01:03:21,041 --> 01:03:22,041
Mugino!

693
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:28,281
Why?!

694
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:32,280
Did I do something to you?

695
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:46,521
I haven't done anything, right?

696
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:55,961
Yeah, right.

697
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:59,120
Oh, I see.

698
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:06,521
You OK?

699
01:04:07,681 --> 01:04:09,080
I'll call a teacher!

700
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:12,321
- What happened?
- Hori pushed him.

701
01:04:30,441 --> 01:04:32,481
Hori? Hori?
What?

702
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:41,921
Watch out, be careful!

703
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:57,120
- Mr. Hori!
- Mr. Hori!

704
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:01,121
Mr. Hori!

705
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:06,800
Mr. Hori, calm down!

706
01:05:07,721 --> 01:05:08,841
Mr. Hori!

707
01:06:49,481 --> 01:06:51,401
"Selective Breeding?"

FIFTH GRADER HOSHIKAWA YORI

710
01:07:09,761 --> 01:07:11,681
MI

711
01:07:11,841 --> 01:07:13,520
NA

712
01:07:13,641 --> 01:07:14,921
TO

713
01:07:21,321 --> 01:07:24,441
Mugino Minato.

714
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:28,721
Hoshikawa...

715
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:51,000
Mugino!

716
01:07:52,161 --> 01:07:53,840
Mugino!

717
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:58,041
I'm sorry!

718
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:01,001
I was wrong!

719
01:08:02,601 --> 01:08:04,880
You did nothing wrong!

720
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:08,441
There's nothing wrong with you!

721
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:11,521
Mugino!

722
01:08:13,361 --> 01:08:14,880
Mugino!

723
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:21,600
Please, let me see Mugino.

724
01:08:21,881 --> 01:08:23,041
Please.

725
01:08:24,001 --> 01:08:25,120
Please!

726
01:08:25,881 --> 01:08:27,281
MUGINO MINATO.

727
01:08:27,521 --> 01:08:30,681
Since he was little,
he always woke up crying.

728
01:08:32,441 --> 01:08:35,960
He always dreamed that the people
he loved were gone and cried.

729
01:08:36,201 --> 01:08:37,721
He's a sweet child.

730
01:08:38,801 --> 01:08:41,400
Um, wait...

731
01:08:45,081 --> 01:08:46,881
Have you seen a child, a boy!

732
01:08:47,001 --> 01:08:49,200
A boy? No, I haven't.

733
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:52,241
There's an evacuation order
Mudslide in the mountain.

734
01:08:52,361 --> 01:08:53,441
Mudslide?

735
01:08:53,561 --> 01:08:56,960
The old railroad tracks ahead of here
Go back! Go back!

736
01:08:57,720 --> 01:08:59,521
Stop! Stop!

737
01:09:06,281 --> 01:09:07,281
Wait...

738
01:09:12,641 --> 01:09:13,921
Hey, you can't!

739
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:17,160
You'll die up in the mountain!
Hey!

740
01:09:28,001 --> 01:09:29,681
Further ahead!?

741
01:09:30,281 --> 01:09:31,841
Minato!

742
01:09:35,561 --> 01:09:37,120
Minato!

743
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:39,841
Mugino!

744
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:43,721
Hoshikawa, you here?

745
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:47,801
Minato?

746
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:52,560
Are you OK?

747
01:09:54,161 --> 01:09:57,801
It's caved in! Caved in!

748
01:09:58,560 --> 01:09:59,841
Minato!

749
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:06,681
The train car!

750
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:18,241
What did he mean by being reborn?

751
01:10:18,377 --> 01:10:19,428
What?

752
01:10:19,453 --> 01:10:22,854
What did he mean by being reborn?
Reborn? Minato!

753
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:30,480
Minato!

754
01:10:36,441 --> 01:10:38,441
Window! Window!

755
01:10:44,441 --> 01:10:45,761
Mugino!

756
01:10:47,081 --> 01:10:48,600
Hoshikawa!

757
01:10:58,320 --> 01:10:59,640
Hey!

758
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:01,961
Can you hear me? Minato!

759
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:04,961
It's your mom!

760
01:11:07,841 --> 01:11:09,521
Minato!

761
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:25,161
Hey!

762
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:28,601
- Minato?!
- Mugino!

763
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:32,280
Hoshikawa!

764
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:57,840
When we went to the supermarket,

765
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:01,560
and I told her to buy
whatever she liked,

766
01:12:01,921 --> 01:12:04,280
she refused, saying,

767
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:08,240
"if I buy my favorite candy,
the candy robber will come."

768
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:09,920
Candy robber?

769
01:12:10,601 --> 01:12:12,080
She said it was real.

770
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:19,800
That if you looked away,
it'd steal the candy and run away.

771
01:12:22,121 --> 01:12:23,961
So, I see.

772
01:12:25,001 --> 01:12:27,521
Whatever I say, you say,
"So, I see".

773
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:31,961
I just remembered, last night.

774
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:38,280
I'm going back to school
from tomorrow,

775
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:42,201
so I thought.

776
01:12:43,881 --> 01:12:47,120
I should tell you while I can.

777
01:12:50,921 --> 01:12:53,201
What about the grave?

778
01:12:55,601 --> 01:12:57,720
They'll get one elsewhere.

779
01:13:03,321 --> 01:13:05,321
I thought that was for the best.

780
01:13:06,081 --> 01:13:07,440
You're right.

781
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,360
A candy robber, huh?

782
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:14,921
That's a great line.

783
01:13:18,641 --> 01:13:19,681
Right?

784
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:37,641
Oh, this...

785
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:48,080
Thanks.

786
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:17,121
Stop, stop, it's dangerous!

787
01:14:17,241 --> 01:14:20,201
- We're fine.
- Where are you going?

788
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:23,001
<i>- Stop!
- Please stop!</i>

789
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:25,881
<i>- It's Hoshikawa Yori.
- It's not Hoshikawa.</i>

790
01:14:26,881 --> 01:14:29,081
<i>Please stop!</i>

791
01:14:30,441 --> 01:14:31,880
<i>You sound just like him.</i>

792
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,000
No, he doesn't.

793
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:35,777
- <i>What are you doing?</i>
- <i>It's Hori, Hori!</i>

794
01:14:35,801 --> 01:14:40,761
- <i>Stop filming me!</i>
- Girl from the hostess bar!

795
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:17,321
- Good morning.
- Morning.

796
01:15:17,441 --> 01:15:18,960
What time did you go to bed?

797
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:20,081
Midnight

798
01:15:20,361 --> 01:15:21,521
2am for me

799
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:22,760
2am?

800
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:25,241
2am? What were you doing?

801
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:29,040
Do you ever think sleeping
is a waste of time? No, right?

802
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:30,641
Bam!

803
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:34,400
Why are you talking to an alien?

804
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:36,961
- It's a prank! Surprised?
- No.

805
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:39,521
Party pooper, party pooper alien.

806
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:44,400
- Sounds tasty.
- I ate soft noodles.

807
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:46,080
Soft noodles.

808
01:15:46,361 --> 01:15:48,000
What's up, Hoshikawa?

809
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:50,160
Good morning, my shoe fell off.

810
01:15:58,280 --> 01:15:59,400
Out loud.

811
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:01,680
Our Future

812
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:05,441
I wrote this composition
when I was in fifth grade.

813
01:16:05,561 --> 01:16:07,601
Never heard of Nishida Hikaru?

814
01:16:07,721 --> 01:16:09,601
- Who?
- Which celebrity?

815
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:16,760
Oh, tambourines.

816
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:21,480
Mugino.

817
01:16:22,361 --> 01:16:23,361
Here.

818
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,841
Kida, you're on music duty, right?
Please go with him.

819
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:31,121
Hoshikawa is, too.

820
01:16:31,241 --> 01:16:34,001
OK, Hoshikawa, take this.

821
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:35,801
Yes.

822
01:16:38,441 --> 01:16:40,281
Please take this.

823
01:16:42,281 --> 01:16:44,720
- Watch your step.
- Yes I will.

824
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:12,720
Secret.

825
01:17:22,401 --> 01:17:25,121
I haven't touched them,
so they're not dirty

826
01:17:25,241 --> 01:17:26,640
I don't think they're dirty.

827
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:28,560
You might catch my disease.

828
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,400
Just surprised you brought snacks.

829
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:40,440
What disease?

830
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:42,880
I told you.

831
01:17:44,481 --> 01:17:45,680
Is your

832
01:17:46,521 --> 01:17:48,840
brain really a pig's brain?

833
01:18:02,841 --> 01:18:06,120
I thought I wouldn't make friends
in my new class, either.

834
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:09,521
We're friends, but...

835
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:20,360
Don't talk to me in front
of the class.

836
01:18:31,401 --> 01:18:34,001
OK, I won't talk to you.

837
01:18:35,241 --> 01:18:37,040
Well, thanks.

838
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:18,600
Cleaning, cleaning.

839
01:19:18,721 --> 01:19:21,561
- Is he here yet?
- Stop that, Daito.

840
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:22,961
Stinks, stinks.

841
01:19:24,041 --> 01:19:26,840
Mugino, hurry, hurry.

842
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:29,281
It's a prank, a prank.

843
01:19:29,681 --> 01:19:31,080
Do it.

844
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:32,640
Do it more, more!

845
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:35,081
Keep doing it, more!

846
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:38,400
Keep doing it, more!

847
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:40,361
Here he is.

848
01:19:57,041 --> 01:19:58,640
- I'll help you.
- Thank you.

849
01:19:58,761 --> 01:20:01,641
Don't just clean it up, react.

850
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:04,280
Hey, Hoshikawa.

851
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:07,361
Kuroda's mole looks like a black bean.

852
01:20:08,321 --> 01:20:10,241
Look at it!

853
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:13,800
- I'll take this.
- Sure.

854
01:20:16,041 --> 01:20:19,601
Say, "Kuroda's mole is a black bean".

855
01:20:20,161 --> 01:20:22,240
I can't say what I don't think.

856
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:25,080
Why do you take the girls' side?
You a girl?

857
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:26,280
A girl alien?

858
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:29,840
My lips are super supple!

859
01:20:32,441 --> 01:20:36,401
- Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
- Cut it out.

860
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:41,321
I mean it, cut it out.

861
01:20:50,201 --> 01:20:52,641
Mugino, what are you doing!

862
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:54,281
Mugino...

863
01:20:57,960 --> 01:20:58,961
Ouch.

864
01:21:01,721 --> 01:21:03,520
Hurts.

865
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:13,440
No way, no way

866
01:21:13,641 --> 01:21:15,561
I can't let you out.

867
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:17,240
Just stay there.

868
01:21:18,521 --> 01:21:20,040
You can't.

869
01:21:22,401 --> 01:21:24,401
What? Do you hear something?

870
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:26,361
A cat.

871
01:21:47,561 --> 01:21:48,881
It's a prank.

872
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:04,361
Sorry for today.

873
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:07,401
Sorry for today.

874
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:16,800
Ever buy a Coke from
the vending machine by the liquor store?

875
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:17,961
Yeah.

876
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:22,400
One in every three times,
the Coke comes out hot.

877
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:25,440
- No way.
- Never got a hot one?

878
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:27,080
I have.

879
01:22:42,201 --> 01:22:43,841
Sorry, kept you waiting.

880
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:46,560
Let's go.

881
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:34,920
Primrose.

882
01:23:35,321 --> 01:23:36,401
Blue star creeper.

883
01:23:36,521 --> 01:23:38,160
Why do you know flower names?

884
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:39,480
Because I like them.

885
01:23:39,681 --> 01:23:41,920
Kerria! Columbine!

886
01:23:42,041 --> 01:23:44,160
White nettle, celandine.

887
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:49,001
Mom said girls prefer boys
who don't know flower names.

888
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:52,241
That boys who know
flower names are creepy?

889
01:23:52,721 --> 01:23:55,560
She wouldn't say creepy
She's a mom.

890
01:23:56,841 --> 01:23:58,001
You're right.

891
01:24:05,481 --> 01:24:08,280
Girls don't like boys
who are scared of the dark.

892
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:15,720
Let's go.

893
01:25:15,681 --> 01:25:16,801
Will you tell?

894
01:25:18,161 --> 01:25:20,760
I won't tell It would spoil it.

895
01:25:24,761 --> 01:25:26,560
All aboard!

896
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:31,680
Clickety-clack, clickety-clack,
clickety...

897
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:33,121
Hello.

898
01:25:33,801 --> 01:25:35,520
Is it sunny where you are?

899
01:25:36,360 --> 01:25:37,761
It's sunny here.

900
01:25:40,521 --> 01:25:42,360
All aboard!

901
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:45,401
You put this here

902
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:49,241
and then tape it like this.

903
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:51,000
Like this.

904
01:26:20,801 --> 01:26:22,520
The end of the line.

905
01:26:33,561 --> 01:26:37,161
"The fa-ther said,
'No, but, then,

906
01:26:37,281 --> 01:26:40,200
"af, ter, think, ing it over,

907
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:43,080
"he, said, OK,

908
01:26:43,201 --> 01:26:45,960
"and la, laugh, laughed."

909
01:26:46,081 --> 01:26:48,440
OK, next.

910
01:26:48,881 --> 01:26:50,841
- Fujimori.
- Yes.

911
01:26:54,041 --> 01:26:56,240
- I made mistakes.
- It's OK.

912
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:15,200
Look, it's here.

913
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:18,521
A cat.

914
01:27:19,681 --> 01:27:22,160
Actually, a former cat.

915
01:27:24,360 --> 01:27:26,201
Does it stop being a cat
when it dies?

916
01:27:26,401 --> 01:27:28,361
That's true of everything that dies.

917
01:27:30,761 --> 01:27:33,041
Left like this, it might not be reborn.

918
01:27:38,681 --> 01:27:40,641
Cover its face with dirt, too?

919
01:27:42,360 --> 01:27:43,840
It's already dead.

920
01:28:16,161 --> 01:28:17,400
Is it OK?

921
01:28:17,961 --> 01:28:20,161
Will it burn like in California?

922
01:28:22,881 --> 01:28:24,921
Maybe a fire truck will come.

923
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:47,280
Did you burn the hostess bar?

924
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:51,440
Because your dad was there?

925
01:28:56,880 --> 01:28:59,680
Drinking alcohol is bad
for your health.

926
01:29:05,160 --> 01:29:06,521
Stinks.

927
01:29:06,921 --> 01:29:08,801
Stinks.

928
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:21,000
Please, open the door.

929
01:29:23,561 --> 01:29:25,441
Please, open the door.

930
01:29:28,001 --> 01:29:31,680
Mugino? It's you, Mugino, right?
Let me out.

931
01:29:33,641 --> 01:29:35,321
Did you pee?

932
01:29:45,680 --> 01:29:50,441
Who's the monster?

933
01:29:51,281 --> 01:29:52,321
Are you OK?

934
01:29:55,680 --> 01:29:57,280
Why not tell Mr. Hori?

935
01:29:58,001 --> 01:29:59,360
He's kind.

936
01:30:00,281 --> 01:30:02,801
He'll just say I'm not
acting like a man.

937
01:30:04,361 --> 01:30:05,441
You don't want to?

938
01:30:05,561 --> 01:30:07,840
Well, I have a pig's brain.

939
01:30:09,401 --> 01:30:10,880
You don't have a pig's brain.

940
01:30:11,441 --> 01:30:13,481
Your dad is wrong.

941
01:30:14,361 --> 01:30:17,360
My dad is kind
He promises to cure my disease.

942
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:20,121
When I'm cured,
Mom will come back.

943
01:30:21,801 --> 01:30:23,520
I don't think you have a disease.

944
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:27,161
He is my dad, so there are things
I just can't say to him.

945
01:30:28,280 --> 01:30:30,641
There are things I can't
say to Mom, either, but...

946
01:30:34,121 --> 01:30:36,360
Your dad died, right?

947
01:30:39,641 --> 01:30:44,400
Actually, he died on a trip
with a lady, Noguchi Minako

948
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:46,041
I see.

949
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:50,681
Noguchi Minako was wearing
a tacky knit dress

950
01:30:51,080 --> 01:30:54,561
I see, that's super interesting.

951
01:30:55,641 --> 01:30:57,480
Glico.

952
01:30:58,241 --> 01:31:00,000
- Glico.
- Big Crunch?

953
01:31:00,120 --> 01:31:02,960
Yeah, the universe keeps expanding.

954
01:31:03,281 --> 01:31:05,840
Right now,
it's blowing up like a balloon.

955
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:10,400
In the end, when the universe
can't get any bigger.

956
01:31:10,520 --> 01:31:12,240
It will split, bam!

957
01:31:12,961 --> 01:31:14,480
Glico.

958
01:31:16,040 --> 01:31:17,801
Will the universe break?

959
01:31:18,120 --> 01:31:22,200
Yeah, time will go backwards
It will turn back,

960
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:27,240
so clocks, people, trains
and cats will all move backwards.

961
01:31:27,641 --> 01:31:29,720
Beef on rice will turn back into cows,

962
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:31,640
and poop goes back into your butt.

963
01:31:31,881 --> 01:31:33,200
Really?

964
01:31:34,240 --> 01:31:37,241
Humans will turn into monkeys,
the dinosaurs will come back

965
01:31:37,361 --> 01:31:39,561
and we'll go back to before
the universe was born.

966
01:31:40,121 --> 01:31:41,761
So, we're going to be reborn.

967
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:43,961
That's right.

968
01:31:46,720 --> 01:31:48,120
Shall we get ready?

969
01:32:01,680 --> 01:32:03,281
"I'm here."

970
01:32:22,680 --> 01:32:24,480
Maybe here?

971
01:32:41,480 --> 01:32:44,161
If it isn't a horse,
I would say, "Wrong".

972
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:45,881
- OK?
- OK

973
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:50,360
It's tasty.

974
01:32:51,873 --> 01:32:53,222
PIG

975
01:32:53,247 --> 01:32:54,761
You eat concrete.

976
01:32:54,842 --> 01:32:55,906
SNAIL

977
01:32:55,931 --> 01:32:57,333
Am I a woodlouse?

978
01:32:57,960 --> 01:32:59,400
No, you're not.

979
01:32:59,720 --> 01:33:02,600
You can't look up at the sky.

980
01:33:04,721 --> 01:33:06,521
Am I chubby?

981
01:33:07,041 --> 01:33:09,600
Like king of chubbiness.

982
01:33:09,801 --> 01:33:11,400
Am I edible?

983
01:33:12,440 --> 01:33:14,201
You're a gourmet food.

984
01:33:16,601 --> 01:33:17,681
I know.

985
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:19,681
One, two.

986
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:21,120
- A pig.
- A snail.

987
01:33:21,441 --> 01:33:23,120
- Correct.
- Correct.

988
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:25,880
Yeah!

989
01:33:28,281 --> 01:33:31,001
- Who's the monster?
- Who's the monster?

990
01:33:31,121 --> 01:33:32,760
SLOTH

991
01:33:33,034 --> 01:33:34,080
You have an amazing talent.

992
01:33:34,105 --> 01:33:35,174
SUNFISH

993
01:33:35,199 --> 01:33:36,731
You have an amazing talent.

994
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,200
Do I kick?

995
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:40,560
You don't kick.

996
01:33:40,761 --> 01:33:42,721
Do I bite and release a poison?

997
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:47,600
When you're attacked,

998
01:33:47,720 --> 01:33:51,281
you let go of all your strength
and give up.

999
01:33:51,401 --> 01:33:52,920
That's not a talent.

1000
01:33:53,440 --> 01:33:54,960
You stop feeling.

1001
01:33:58,160 --> 01:34:00,240
Am I Hoshikawa Yori?

1002
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:09,000
My future.

1003
01:34:11,160 --> 01:34:12,240
Bull's eye.

1004
01:34:14,280 --> 01:34:16,161
Rugby player.

1005
01:34:17,480 --> 01:34:18,840
My future...

1006
01:34:21,200 --> 01:34:22,361
My future...

1007
01:34:37,121 --> 01:34:40,121
"Mu-Gi-No Mi-Na-To.

1008
01:34:40,281 --> 01:34:42,161
"Ho-Shi-Ka-Wa Yo-Ri."

1009
01:34:45,960 --> 01:34:48,080
Do you think Mr. Hori will notice?

1010
01:34:48,521 --> 01:34:51,281
I don't think he will.

1011
01:34:57,800 --> 01:34:58,880
Ouch!

1012
01:35:03,120 --> 01:35:04,520
Oh, wait!

1013
01:35:09,801 --> 01:35:12,080
So many Over here, too.

1014
01:35:12,961 --> 01:35:13,961
There.

1015
01:35:14,120 --> 01:35:15,120
Thanks.

1016
01:35:15,801 --> 01:35:16,920
Where else?

1017
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:19,241
Up there, up!

1018
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:33,200
I found a lot!

1019
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:40,361
- Ouch.
- You OK?

1020
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:50,121
It's not your fault.

1021
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:56,600
I was thinking about something.

1022
01:35:57,360 --> 01:36:00,401
It seems like I have to
change schools.

1023
01:36:02,120 --> 01:36:03,360
Where?

1024
01:36:04,440 --> 01:36:05,801
Grandma's house.

1025
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:11,201
So you won't have to
worry anymore.

1026
01:36:24,401 --> 01:36:26,160
Your dad's abandoning you.

1027
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:27,600
What a laugh.

1028
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:30,281
Yeah.

1029
01:36:31,601 --> 01:36:34,841
No, I said it on purpose
to make you laugh.

1030
01:36:35,321 --> 01:36:36,840
I'm not mad.

1031
01:36:37,481 --> 01:36:39,641
I don't want you to go away...

1032
01:36:50,160 --> 01:36:51,240
I'm sorry.

1033
01:36:57,401 --> 01:36:58,680
Minato...

1034
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:05,640
Wait, wait, get away.

1035
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:06,960
Get away.

1036
01:37:22,841 --> 01:37:24,321
It's OK.

1037
01:37:25,721 --> 01:37:27,000
It happens...

1038
01:37:27,321 --> 01:37:28,760
To me, sometimes.

1039
01:38:25,040 --> 01:38:27,881
Hey, you're supposed to laugh!

1040
01:38:28,440 --> 01:38:29,481
Pass!

1041
01:38:30,721 --> 01:38:31,800
Over here!

1042
01:38:41,001 --> 01:38:42,041
Pass it, Minato!

1043
01:38:42,161 --> 01:38:43,920
Pass it to me! Pass it!

1044
01:38:44,081 --> 01:38:45,440
Minato!

1045
01:38:46,881 --> 01:38:48,720
Are you friendly with Hoshikawa?

1046
01:38:49,320 --> 01:38:50,921
Do you like Hoshikawa?

1047
01:38:51,040 --> 01:38:54,041
Gross.
You two are lovey dovey.

1048
01:38:54,161 --> 01:38:58,200
Yeah, lovey dovey!

1049
01:39:09,081 --> 01:39:10,481
What?

1050
01:39:13,721 --> 01:39:15,881
What are you doing?
Stop it!

1051
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,320
- No good!
- Mugino!

1052
01:39:22,361 --> 01:39:24,521
Teacher's here!

1053
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:28,361
You're bandaged.

1054
01:39:29,321 --> 01:39:30,360
You're OK!

1055
01:39:52,161 --> 01:39:55,440
I'm supposed to report you

1056
01:39:55,881 --> 01:39:57,560
but let's keep it a secret.

1057
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:01,200
Time to make up.

1058
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:04,000
Shake hands like men.

1059
01:40:06,240 --> 01:40:09,240
Time for you both to change
into your gym clothes.

1060
01:41:05,681 --> 01:41:08,441
Three, two, one.

1061
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:33,521
Who's the monster?

1062
01:41:38,480 --> 01:41:40,841
Who's the monster?

1063
01:41:41,681 --> 01:41:43,920
- Who's the...
- Minato?

1064
01:41:48,521 --> 01:41:49,600
Minato?

1065
01:42:03,561 --> 01:42:04,761
Your ear hurt?

1066
01:42:07,401 --> 01:42:08,561
I'm sorry.

1067
01:42:09,041 --> 01:42:10,160
I...

1068
01:42:10,561 --> 01:42:12,960
Can't be like Dad.

1069
01:42:15,201 --> 01:42:17,121
I've promised your father.

1070
01:42:18,761 --> 01:42:21,320
That I'll hang in there until you're
married and have your...

1071
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:23,553
Just an ordinary family
you see anywhere is fine.

1072
01:42:23,577 --> 01:42:24,600
YORI

1073
01:42:24,720 --> 01:42:26,616
own family, the
greatest treasure...

1074
01:42:26,640 --> 01:42:27,640
Minato?

1075
01:43:12,320 --> 01:43:13,841
Why was I born?

1076
01:43:27,321 --> 01:43:29,681
- Say...
- Tell him.

1077
01:43:30,720 --> 01:43:32,760
I'm cured of my sickness now.

1078
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:36,961
I worried you, but I'm all fine now.

1079
01:43:37,320 --> 01:43:38,520
Cured of what?

1080
01:43:38,801 --> 01:43:40,841
- I'm normal now.
- You were always normal.

1081
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:44,481
There's a girl you like near
grandma's house, right?

1082
01:43:45,080 --> 01:43:46,481
She's Shindo Ayaka.

1083
01:43:47,120 --> 01:43:49,481
Thank you for playing with him.

1084
01:43:50,201 --> 01:43:51,480
Thank you.

1085
01:44:10,481 --> 01:44:11,840
I'm sorry, I lied!

1086
01:44:14,121 --> 01:44:15,720
Hoshikawa! Hoshikawa!

1087
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:18,641
- Hurts!
- Why can't you do what I tell you!

1088
01:44:18,761 --> 01:44:19,961
I'll punish you again.

1089
01:44:20,081 --> 01:44:21,881
- Shut up!
- Stop! It hurts.

1090
01:44:25,881 --> 01:44:29,240
We'll have...
Confiscated.

1091
01:44:29,920 --> 01:44:32,880
We'll have a new teacher
replace Mr. Hori.

1092
01:44:33,321 --> 01:44:38,720
If you have any problem at all,
discuss it honestly with a teacher.

1093
01:44:43,800 --> 01:44:45,041
Is that Hori?

1094
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:47,640
It's Hori.

1095
01:44:48,921 --> 01:44:50,240
Why's Hori here?

1096
01:44:50,480 --> 01:44:51,681
Mugino.

1097
01:44:52,361 --> 01:44:54,681
Mugino, Mugino!

1098
01:44:57,041 --> 01:44:58,961
Why is he back now?

1099
01:44:59,081 --> 01:45:03,161
- Is he angry about his punishment?
- It's his own fault.

1100
01:45:03,480 --> 01:45:06,400
We've had enough of his problems.

1101
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:28,361
I'm sorry.

1102
01:45:31,400 --> 01:45:33,480
Who are you apologizing to?

1103
01:45:37,481 --> 01:45:39,480
Mr. Hori did nothing wrong.

1104
01:45:46,401 --> 01:45:48,120
I told a lie.

1105
01:45:50,720 --> 01:45:51,920
I see.

1106
01:45:54,921 --> 01:45:56,320
So did I.

1107
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:08,081
I used to be a music teacher.

1108
01:46:09,200 --> 01:46:14,000
My brass band club
used to compete nationally.

1109
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:30,401
Hold it this way.

1110
01:46:34,561 --> 01:46:37,200
Your left hand holds this.

1111
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:41,001
Have you ever seen one?
You extend this

1112
01:46:41,321 --> 01:46:43,201
to change the pitch.

1113
01:46:46,440 --> 01:46:50,881
And then your mouth here
Loosen your lips.

1114
01:47:05,921 --> 01:47:07,400
Not bad.

1115
01:47:10,240 --> 01:47:12,440
Maybe a lighter instrument is better.

1116
01:47:16,280 --> 01:47:17,681
I see,

1117
01:47:19,200 --> 01:47:21,080
so you told a lie...

1118
01:47:32,801 --> 01:47:34,440
I, um...

1119
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,160
I'm not really sure,

1120
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:52,800
but I like someone.

1121
01:47:58,041 --> 01:47:59,200
I see.

1122
01:48:05,880 --> 01:48:08,120
I can't tell anyone, so I lie.

1123
01:48:12,761 --> 01:48:14,921
Cause they'll know
I can never be happy.

1124
01:48:23,200 --> 01:48:24,480
In that case,

1125
01:48:27,480 --> 01:48:29,960
whatever you can't tell anyone,

1126
01:48:33,161 --> 01:48:35,000
blow it away.

1127
01:48:48,961 --> 01:48:50,520
Blow it away.

1128
01:49:11,640 --> 01:49:13,520
But that's nonsense.

1129
01:49:15,841 --> 01:49:19,840
If only some people can have it,
that's not happiness.

1130
01:49:23,600 --> 01:49:25,721
That's just nonsense.

1131
01:49:26,441 --> 01:49:29,801
Happiness is something
anyone can have.

1132
01:50:42,921 --> 01:50:44,360
Hoshikawa?

1133
01:50:53,880 --> 01:50:55,280
Hoshikawa?

1134
01:51:15,480 --> 01:51:16,680
Hoshikawa?

1135
01:51:26,241 --> 01:51:27,520
Hoshikawa?

1136
01:51:27,960 --> 01:51:31,001
Hoshikawa!
The Big Crunch is coming.

1137
01:52:26,681 --> 01:52:27,960
It's safe!

1138
01:52:29,160 --> 01:52:30,320
You're right.

1139
01:53:14,080 --> 01:53:15,200
Want to eat?

1140
01:53:29,640 --> 01:53:31,241
Will it take off?

1141
01:53:34,920 --> 01:53:36,641
Sounds like it's taking off.

1142
01:55:51,161 --> 01:55:52,880
Were we reborn?

1143
01:55:53,440 --> 01:55:55,201
I don't think that happened.

1144
01:55:56,040 --> 01:55:57,161
We weren't?

1145
01:55:57,960 --> 01:56:00,041
We weren't, we're the same.

1146
01:56:01,080 --> 01:56:02,960
OK, great.
