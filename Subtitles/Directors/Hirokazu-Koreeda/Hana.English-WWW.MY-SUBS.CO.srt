1
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:22,750
{\i1}In the year 1701, in a royal
hallway of Edo castle,{\i0}

2
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:26,750
{\i1}Lord Akou assaulted Kira,
a nobleman, with his sword!{\i0}

3
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,750
{\i1}Lord Akou was made to commit hara-kiri{\i0}

4
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,340
{\i1}as his vassals scattered as ronin,
disguised as merchants and doctors...{\i0}

5
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:36,600
{\i1}Our story begins one year later,
in a poor neighbourhood in Edo{\i0}

6
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,720
{\i1}By this winter morning,{\i0}

7
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:42,770
{\i1}sword fighting has blown
out of fashion with the wind{\i0}

8
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:51,070
{\i1}For Rent{\i0}

9
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:01,950
Wake up!

10
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,460
Morning time... Wake up!

11
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,480
Quick, wash your face and
get down to the fish market

12
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,140
Let me sleep a little longer, Onobu...

13
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:27,480
You took the day off yesterday

14
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:32,480
The sun's already up!

15
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:39,320
Hurry up!
I'll leave you behind

16
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:46,080
All this noise
every damned morning

17
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,630
Please let me escape this dump

18
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,520
Is master Soza up and about?

19
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,190
What's your business with him?
I'm sure you're up to no good

20
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:12,690
Do you have to put it like that?
He needs my advice, that's all

21
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,530
Hurry, Pa, or they'll close
the fish market

22
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,200
I'm taking the day off

23
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,660
You took the day off yesterday

24
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,370
What are you still doing in bed?

25
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,880
Good morning, Osae san

26
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,540
Already off?

27
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:37,050
The weather's so fine, I'll deliver
the sewing I've finished

28
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:40,010
Good for you
Off you go

29
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:42,970
Did you hear that?!

30
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:44,470
Who cares

31
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,670
Ouch!
What the hell

32
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,590
Can't be helped
in such close quarters...

33
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,010
Watch yourself

34
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:24,930
How's things?

35
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,430
You know they're never good

36
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,020
Right

37
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:31,440
At this rate,
I'll never get Onobu to marry me

38
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,400
Fool, you know Onobu's
going to marry me

39
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,030
There you go again

40
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,610
Later

41
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,470
HANA

42
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,450
I envy you

43
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:26,160
If your revenge plan goes well,

44
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,740
you'll be a rich and respected man

45
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:32,160
You can leave this seedy life behind

46
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:39,590
Lucky your father left you
a score to settle

47
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,010
My father died peacefully
that's no use at all

48
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,010
Hirano san, where to, today?

49
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,350
To the castle

50
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,140
Oh, to see your friend, the retainer?

51
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:54,350
Enough of that ingrate

52
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,480
I've got a relative who's
assigned to the study in Edo castle

53
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:00,860
I am off to petition him
for an official post

54
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:04,860
A good position
in contact with the Shogun

55
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:08,370
I once did this man a favor...

56
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:10,990
Off already?

57
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,460
I must be on my way

58
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:20,630
Hey, ronin
If you want the castle, it's this-a-way

59
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:22,670
Excuse me

60
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,550
You heard? He knows
one of the government retainers

61
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,220
And has a relative in the castle study

62
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:33,390
Oh, no, the tale keeps
getting taller and taller

63
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:37,230
I found him, your enemy

64
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,400
Not, again...

65
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,070
This time, I swear it's him

66
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:49,240
The water's perfect

67
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,740
I know another guy...

68
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:34,450
"Height 175cm,
fair skin with regular teeth

69
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:40,540
{\i1}WANTED{\i0}

70
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,800
Ah, the marked cheek is on his face,
not his backside...

71
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:46,630
Yes

72
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,300
Age?

73
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,470
Thirty

74
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,430
Thirty...

75
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:58,480
Much older looking
since I last saw him...

76
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:05,320
Don't lose heart, Soza

77
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:09,610
Finding a man in Edo's sprawl
is like winning the lottery

78
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,990
It could take 10 years, no, 20...

79
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:15,410
Hey, sis, another sake

80
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,500
Patience...

81
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,300
But he's the right height, right?

82
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:02,000
I'll go over it once more
so listen well

83
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:06,130
Our shit fertilizes
the rice paddies and fields

84
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:09,630
That's why the farmer pays money
to buy it from the rich landlord,

85
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:12,050
who owns this tenement

86
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:16,510
And that money pays for New Year's
rice cakes for all of us

87
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,680
You mean, rice cakes
come from shit?

88
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,060
Well, not quite,
but you're not far off, either

89
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,690
Useless, it's damp!

90
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:37,370
That's a fine sum
Don't be stingy with those rice cakes

91
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:42,540
Save that line for when
you've paid your rent

92
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,090
And I don't recall letting a room
to that prancing idiot beside you

93
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:51,550
I'll work hard for lots of
rice cakes next year

94
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:54,050
Yeah, let's do that

95
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:02,600
{\i1}Despite the passage of time you've
yet to avenge your father{\i0}

96
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:08,610
{\i1}Our entire family struggles
to sustain itself{\i0}

97
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,950
{\i1}My frugal housekeeping permits me
to forward this sum,{\i0}

98
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:18,780
{\i1}but alas, there is no more...{\i0}

99
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:31,130
The samurai goes to the
bath house daily,

100
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,760
{\i1}thanks to money made off
peasants' backs...{\i0}

101
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:46,890
I bet...
You've never killed a soul

102
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:53,440
Just like you've never used
that sword against anyone

103
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:58,240
How the hell are you ever
going to avenge your father?

104
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,660
“How the hell..."

105
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:09,420
I'll strike him with all my might
and if that's not sufficient,

106
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:12,750
I'll take my life gracefully
just like the cherry blossoms

107
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:18,180
That's the Warrior's way of death

108
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,970
This, my father taught me

109
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:26,850
One rainy night last spring,

110
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:32,610
the man who lived here, was
ruined and decided to end it all

111
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:37,030
He got as far as slashing
his wife's throat,

112
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,490
but then his only kid

113
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,660
turned on him and stabbed him

114
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:49,960
Hearing the noise I rushed over,
this place was a sea of blood

115
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:55,050
Right about where you're sitting now...

116
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:03,890
The old man was bleeding to death,
guts spurting

117
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,520
I wouldn't call that graceful...

118
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:09,390
I'd call it a massacre

119
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:12,730
That's what a man's death means

120
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:16,230
Don't talk about living and dying,

121
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,740
without being ready for the worst

122
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:45,600
Good morning, Soza san

123
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:48,430
Good morning

124
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,850
Are you going out?

125
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:54,770
Just to the toilet
You, Osae san?

126
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:58,940
We're going to pray at the shrine
You should come, Soza san

127
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:01,450
No, Shinnosuke

128
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:05,620
He's a busy man

129
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:15,630
Mother

130
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,310
Good day

131
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,890
Good day

132
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:51,330
What did you pray for?

133
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,500
That I may find my enemy soon

134
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,340
Mother?

135
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:03,670
That you may stay a sweet-natured boy

136
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,760
And you?

137
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,510
That Father will return safely

138
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:20,020
How can one god answer
so many prayers?

139
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,030
Come here, come here and buy

140
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:29,660
Take a look at these toys,
very popular!

141
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:32,830
I've got every kind

142
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:36,620
We go this-a-way,
we go that-a-way

143
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:45,220
My husband died of
a lung disease

144
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,800
when our boy was only two

145
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,310
Today is his monthly anniversary

146
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,520
I see...

147
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:59,400
Time keeps passing by and
I haven't yet told him the truth

148
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,830
What does that say?

149
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:15,410
No tabs

150
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,870
What's a tab?

151
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,710
A tab? A tab means...

152
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:24,670
You want to eat now but pay later

153
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:28,260
Sada san's always asking for that

154
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:32,600
Actually, he never,
ever pays his tabs, so we call

155
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,100
someone like him "a deadbeat"

156
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,270
How do you write
“run out on debts?"

157
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,600
“Deadbeat?”

158
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:40,560
The way you write it...

159
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,610
You write "step out"...

160
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:47,280
with "on your debts"

161
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:51,240
means “run out"

162
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,700
Let's try that again

163
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,580
{\i1}Abacus and Writing
Lessons{\i0}
Clear the abacus
for the next calculation...

164
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,630
{\i1}Abacus and Writing
Lessons{\i0}

165
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:01,540
That's 7 pence

166
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:03,960
Eight pence

167
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,550
Five pence

168
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,930
Two pence

169
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:11,470
Three pence

170
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:14,970
If you're going to teach,
why not teach swordfighting?

171
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:20,140
What's the point in a world
with no more war? Idiot

172
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:24,440
But a samurai teaching the abacus?

173
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,650
Got nothing to do with avenging...

174
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,780
As they say,
“Hunger is a terrible master..."

175
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,620
"Hunger's the master"

176
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:34,780
The point is, a man

177
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:38,120
doesn't need to read if he's
got the guts to fight

178
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,830
As they say here,
“Only the countrymen keep their money"

179
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:45,590
We spend our money as soon as
we make it. Who needs calculations?

180
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,170
You're not even from around here

181
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,010
You're in the way, move

182
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:50,630
What do you want in there?

183
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,180
Soza san to teach me how to write

184
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,430
You, too?

185
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:57,680
At least I'll learn how
to write my own name

186
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:02,650
You have no guts
You should learn, too

187
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,190
Damn it

188
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,360
"My own name" my ass!

189
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:16,200
I'll never write a single word,
until the day I die

190
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,250
Everyone finished?

191
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:41,620
Can you believe Kenbo's
learning to write?

192
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:45,540
He's smart

193
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:48,290
and good looking

194
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,310
Good bye

195
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,480
See you tomorrow

196
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:38,010
{\i1}Clinic{\i0}

197
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:45,020
Isn't he going to inherit
the martial arts academy?

198
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:50,020
Yes, his father was a grand
fencing master

199
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,650
A samurai teaching kids to write...

200
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,360
It's not right

201
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,360
You... should investigate

202
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:00,780
He may be have ties to Kira

203
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,830
I warned you about this

204
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:07,540
Even scattered, it's risky
with too many of us in town

205
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:20,380
All right
Not to worry, it's nothing

206
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:23,050
Though I can't heal
much more than this

207
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,810
Soza san, is this the first time
you've met Kichiemon?

208
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:29,730
Yes

209
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,400
I'm Kichiemon

210
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:34,730
I'm Aoki Soza-emon

211
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:40,150
Soza san has come from up north,
to avenge his father

212
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,910
I see

213
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:43,990
Revenge, huh...

214
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:48,250
It's been over two and a half years now,
with no leads...

215
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:50,580
Two and a half years, I'm sorry

216
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:55,590
But why here?
Any special reason?

217
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:00,590
These places often shelter strangers

218
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,890
A good place
to seek my enemy...

219
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,850
Strangers?

220
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:08,270
Master Aoki,
what do you do for fun?

221
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,350
Fun?

222
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,110
My pleasures are...
Bathing and...

223
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:18,070
I also keep birds
And I like to play Go

224
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:22,070
Kichiemon also enjoys Go
Why not challenge each other?

225
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,450
Yes, an excellent plan

226
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,630
Over a game of Go...

227
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,810
Yes
It was at a Go tournament

228
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:53,140
"You've called halt four times"
“No, it's only three," that's how it began

229
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,230
"You're just an idiot,
how dare you call me a liar! Draw!"

230
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,490
I'm so sorry

231
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:10,490
He always longed to die at war

232
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,580
Dying over a silly dispute

233
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,000
Must have been a shame

234
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:21,340
At least...

235
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:26,010
If he had died in a manner
more worthy of a warrior...

236
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,680
One moment

237
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,540
I've always been...

238
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:02,840
handy this way

239
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:15,060
That's all for today, Soza san

240
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:18,730
So I stand at 7 wins, 3 losses
Do come back

241
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:30,820
Welcome

242
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:39,920
Don't stare

243
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,840
Done yet?

244
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,050
Not yet

245
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,090
Tell me when you're done

246
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:53,850
I hope it's a lot

247
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,770
A lot, a lot

248
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:10,280
A lot, a lot

249
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:24,630
Revenge?

250
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:27,050
That's right
It's just a play

251
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:27,970
A play?

252
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:30,090
This'll be your first

253
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:34,970
Every spring festival, Shigehachi writes
a script and we stage a revenge play

254
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:38,310
Despite his looks,
this guy's smart

255
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,480
Despite my looks...

256
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:44,980
I've got more confidence in
my brains than my guts

257
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:47,110
Same goes for me

258
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:50,150
The crowd paid us well
last year

259
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,820
Osae san looked so pretty
in her costume

260
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:54,320
Osae san, too?

261
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:59,160
They only love our show so much,

262
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,420
half aware it's a farce,

263
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:07,170
because real fights are so scarce

264
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:09,800
We make money...

265
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:14,470
Thanks to those cowardly
Akou ronin who can't avenge their Lord

266
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:23,850
Did they beat you up, Shinbo?

267
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,110
No

268
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:26,650
What then?

269
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:29,780
They made fun of me

270
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:30,860
How?

271
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:34,030
They said I live like a pig
in a rubbish heap

272
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,530
What the hell?

273
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,990
And that everyone
who lives here is trash

274
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,790
Who the hell said that?

275
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:42,160
Don't get so upset,
they're just kids

276
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:43,540
Besides, they're right

277
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:46,790
They said "why bother buying trash,
just sell your own"

278
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,380
That'd be me

279
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:49,630
Got that right

280
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:51,220
What's wrong with my work?

281
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:54,550
Bring the brat here
I'll beat the shit outta him

282
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,010
Hurry up, bring the brat

283
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,350
Soza san

284
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,390
Teach me to use a sword
I really want to beat them

285
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,060
Sounds great
Teach him, Soza

286
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:09,690
Act like a samurai for once

287
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:15,740
My father made me promise
no fighting outside the academy

288
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:18,910
That's pretty useless

289
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:21,910
I'll teach you

290
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:23,830
Come here

291
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,750
Hold this

292
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:32,420
Grab this tight
Hold it in front of your belly

293
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:35,680
Hold it really straight

294
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,430
Lift it straight up and...
Bring it down

295
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,890
What's going on here?

296
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:46,600
Shinbo's practicing vengeance

297
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:47,900
For the play?

298
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:50,190
No, the genuine article

299
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:55,110
Swing it down hard
And shout

300
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:01,370
Oto san
What would you do in his place?

301
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:03,950
I'd learn how to take a punch
without getting hurt

302
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:04,960
How's that?

303
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,960
Let 'em hit you where it doesn't hurt
and call it quits

304
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,750
Who taught you that pathetic trick?

305
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,460
My dad, before he died

306
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:15,220
What a legacy!

307
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,220
Your mom's a real terror...

308
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:21,140
Yup, it's come in real handy.
Thanks, Dad

309
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,140
Don't force it

310
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:27,390
Give it here
Hold this, straight, straight

311
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:30,150
When you're ready to strike...

312
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,150
That's it

313
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:41,490
Shinbo, come on,
hit me like you mean it

314
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,790
Hey, that's dangerous

315
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:46,500
Come and get me, crybaby

316
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:49,000
You want to win, right?

317
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:10,310
Listen

318
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:14,360
It's no good swinging
like that useless Lord Akou

319
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:18,360
Swords are made for thrusting

320
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:22,200
Got it? Try it

321
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:28,870
That's right, that's good

322
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:33,000
Aim at their knees and ankles,

323
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:34,960
where it's hard and it'll hurt

324
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:37,210
That's cheating...

325
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:58,190
Say, noble samurai

326
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,900
Why don't you come after me?

327
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,870
I think not

328
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:07,160
It's childish to take on an amateur

329
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,040
No need to worry

330
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:15,090
I want to show Shinbo, fencing
learned in a dojo, is useless in reality

331
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,130
Find any fish?

332
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:04,630
Watch out!

333
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:22,150
Mago!

334
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:42,920
He's useless...

335
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,270
Cheater

336
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,770
Listen up, Shinbo

337
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:03,780
This way, they'll never bother you again

338
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:06,990
If that's not your style,

339
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:10,870
get that guy to show you how
to take a punch without getting hurt

340
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:37,390
Somebody...
Look after Soza san

341
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:52,740
Hey, there's a sudden chill in the air

342
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:13,430
{\i1}Taking a few days off{\i0}

343
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,510
Daddy, you're home!

344
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,950
It's spinning

345
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:55,870
It's caught

346
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:57,030
You're right

347
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:57,990
Other way

348
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,370
This time the other way

349
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:24,560
- Welcome home
- Thanks

350
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:27,150
What's that?

351
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:29,020
It was just lying there

352
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:31,190
Someone was in a hurry

353
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:36,240
I'm home, baby

354
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:38,240
Can you hear?

355
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,650
Hirano san...

356
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:56,320
Are you all right?

357
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,410
Do you have a stomach ache?

358
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,080
Hirano san...

359
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,930
Hey, Sada san!

360
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:31,190
Look what a mess you made of the floor
The landlord won't like this

361
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,690
Get a doctor, quick!

362
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:36,360
He'll be fine, it's the third time
And the sword's bamboo

363
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:39,530
He tries to commit hara-kiri
every spring

364
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:40,990
- Pathetic
- Ouch

365
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:46,700
Listen, if you do this on the floor,
it's a pain in the neck to clean up

366
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:49,160
If you must,
do it on the dirt floor

367
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:51,540
Answer me

368
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:52,880
Oh, no!

369
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:58,720
Soza san, please get Dr. Onodera

370
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:04,010
Soza san

371
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:07,720
What a bunch of hopeless losers...

372
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:11,140
Bamboo...

373
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:13,730
Osae san...

374
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,900
Thank you

375
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:29,540
I could've sworn he was taller

376
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:33,210
Enough of your stories

377
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:36,210
Give me the money

378
00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:37,590
Money?

379
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:39,590
Oh, hello

380
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:41,340
Pick it up

381
00:36:56,150 --> 00:37:00,400
Sada san
I'm grateful

382
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:03,450
What for?
I was in the mood for something sweet

383
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:11,250
Actually, Sada san

384
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:13,460
Why so serious, suddenly?

385
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:19,380
I've already found him...
Kanazawa Jubei

386
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:21,420
Changed his name

387
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:22,720
Heisuke, right?

388
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:26,260
He's a laborer in Kawaracho

389
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,720
That widow he's living with is a beauty

390
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:30,640
- You knew!
- Yeah, I knew

391
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,980
- Since when?
- For a while

392
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,600
- But you...
- Listen

393
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:39,940
Have you told anyone else yet?

394
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,990
Then let's keep it secret

395
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:51,290
In this day and age, this samurai
revenge thing's out of style

396
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:55,620
Besides, with your skills,
you're doomed

397
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:59,670
Think I can have another?

398
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,260
Another, please

399
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:16,140
So, sell any?

400
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:17,940
Not this crap

401
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:22,030
Welcome home, Soza san

402
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:23,530
Another day

403
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:27,660
Off to the bath with Sada?
Treat me, sometime

404
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:32,790
Wish I'd get a good job

405
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,370
Tried buying scraps?

406
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:35,540
No way!

407
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:36,500
Why?

408
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,790
Stinks

409
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:40,460
Figured

410
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,730
What do you see, Mago?

411
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,570
I see night

412
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:02,850
Say, Soza san

413
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:07,320
What will happen to your bird?

414
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:12,200
I wonder...

415
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:15,530
Is he stuck underground forever?

416
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:19,990
It's dark and it's cold
and he won't like it

417
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:25,880
I wonder if my father's
underground somewhere

418
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:30,210
Shinbo...

419
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:34,220
Don't tell my mother

420
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,550
She still thinks
he's going to come home

421
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:43,020
Sure

422
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:50,900
Let's pray again,
that your father's in some place warm

423
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:22,270
On his deathbed,
my father held my hand and begged,

424
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:27,600
“Soza, please avenge me"

425
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:35,240
But I'm a hopeless swordsman,
and haven't fulfilled this task

426
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,410
His one dying wish

427
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:44,620
That is my inheritance

428
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:47,870
Inheritance?

429
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,210
Yes

430
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:54,630
It's why I have to pay back
his enemy with my own hands

431
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,300
Is that true?

432
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:04,060
I can understand your feelings,
but this is how I see it

433
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:09,310
If, after living his whole life,

434
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:14,400
your father left you nothing
but hate,

435
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:16,740
it would be unbearably sad

436
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:21,490
Mother, come

437
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:34,250
"Owing to my imminent starvation,

438
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:36,510
"I pray you will send funds

439
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:40,680
“upon receipt of this letter

440
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:44,810
"May I inquire, Father,

441
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:47,930
"whether you are happy and healthy?

442
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:50,940
"Hope you will take

443
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:55,860
“the very best care of yourself

444
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:58,360
"Yours, Sakutaro"

445
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:01,320
That's what it says

446
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:06,870
So, how will you reply?

447
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:08,870
Reply?

448
00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:14,210
I have no reply

449
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:28,060
What, a samurai?

450
00:44:28,890 --> 00:44:30,810
So spoilt

451
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:34,860
You have no skills

452
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,860
I wouldn't be so proud if I were you

453
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:42,910
What's the big deal over
those two swords you have?

454
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:49,330
The village dumpling-maker
serves them three at a time

455
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:54,670
Whenever he gets that drunk,

456
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,090
he brings old letters in
for me to read

457
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:03,720
He never once sent a reply,

458
00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:06,760
so he's bad for business...

459
00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:21,280
Soza san,

460
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:25,530
why do you think samurai exist?

461
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:27,910
Why?

462
00:45:29,990 --> 00:45:33,460
Peasants grow rice

463
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:37,630
Merchants sell things

464
00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:48,300
Just as that drunk said,

465
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:54,060
samurai alone make nothing,
and sell nothing

466
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:03,320
The samurai were meant

467
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:08,820
to live, giving and
taking life at war

468
00:46:11,330 --> 00:46:15,500
Time has passed and war is over

469
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:20,170
But the samurai remain

470
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:25,340
I'd say that's the root
of their troubles

471
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:33,180
Say, that gives me an idea

472
00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:52,540
Will that lazy Oishi
ever come to Edo?

473
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:54,540
That's why I keep saying

474
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:58,830
We should've attacked the Kira mansion
when they forced our lord into hara-kiri

475
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:00,630
But that chief retainer...

476
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:04,210
He's hopeless
He and his son are both sex maniacs

477
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:08,220
The father chases female ass,
the son chases male ass

478
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:10,510
Old man Kira's retired now...

479
00:47:10,590 --> 00:47:13,390
At this rate, he'll die of old age
before we can kill him

480
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:17,060
Onodera san, it's hardly the time
for poetry

481
00:47:17,270 --> 00:47:18,730
Oh, sorry

482
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:23,150
But there's nothing gained
by panicking

483
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:27,700
"A prayer for
a despised enemy's

484
00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:29,740
"longevity"

485
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:35,410
Revenge, revenge!

486
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:40,920
"Art thou Akiyama Gengobei?"

487
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:45,590
They're making a racket
Are they trying to rub it in?

488
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,760
"My son and I...

489
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:53,600
"rain drenched and windswept...

490
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:55,760
“The trials and...

491
00:47:56,470 --> 00:47:59,440
“The trials and tribulations
of such times..."

492
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:02,770
Mocking the Warrior's
sacred vengeance

493
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:04,940
They won't get away with this

494
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:10,070
"Now, fight and fight fair"

495
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:16,950
"I cut my enemy down in warrior's
vengeance, not petty motives

496
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:20,620
"Now you deserve revenge"

497
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:24,130
Listen, Soza
This isn't the Kabuki

498
00:48:24,210 --> 00:48:26,210
No need to overdo it

499
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:29,760
And now, "Not so fast,
just a little wait, please"

500
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:32,720
That's my cue to step in and mediate

501
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,390
Hey, can I say the
"Not so fast" line?

502
00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:38,640
The part's way too much
for you

503
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:42,140
Do the best with your "Revenge!" part

504
00:48:42,270 --> 00:48:44,270
For once, I want a big part

505
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:46,650
You're lucky to even get any lines

506
00:48:47,150 --> 00:48:49,490
"It is a day for admiring blossoms

507
00:48:49,610 --> 00:48:53,820
“Can you face the gods if your swords
draw blood among the temple-goers?

508
00:48:53,950 --> 00:48:58,160
"Out of respect for me,
won't you postpone this fight?"

509
00:48:58,330 --> 00:49:03,460
And if the enemy also does
a little dance, the crowd will applaud

510
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:10,840
Soza san, excuse me

511
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:14,760
I'd like to discuss something

512
00:49:14,890 --> 00:49:16,260
What is it?

513
00:49:16,510 --> 00:49:20,770
Not here
May I come to your place?

514
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:37,490
Oh, don't bother
I won't stay long

515
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:45,040
Please don't make a fuss

516
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:54,880
Ouch, ouch...

517
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:06,020
He's just sipping tea quietly

518
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:08,230
Hurry up and jump her, man

519
00:50:08,310 --> 00:50:11,030
Despite his looks...

520
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:23,750
Um...

521
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:40,760
I don't know if I should be
asking you this...

522
00:50:40,850 --> 00:50:44,600
But it's too late
to ask Shigehachi san...

523
00:50:47,270 --> 00:50:48,560
Um...

524
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:53,280
What do "Drifting log {\i1}mokki{\i0}"' and
{\i1}"Udonge{\i0} flower" mean?

525
00:50:57,860 --> 00:51:00,120
Mokki... you mean?

526
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:03,290
It's one of my lines in the play,

527
00:51:03,410 --> 00:51:06,290
but I've never been able to figure out
what it means

528
00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:09,040
Mokki...

529
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:12,130
I wonder how you write it...

530
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:13,800
A {\i1}mouki{\i0} is...

531
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:16,300
The characters are "blind" and "turtle"

532
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:21,140
A turtle, worn out with swimming,
finally rests refuge on a floating log

533
00:51:22,810 --> 00:51:25,890
The "udonge flower" blooms once
every 3 thousand years

534
00:51:25,970 --> 00:51:29,060
Because the rare “udonge" flower
resemble a spider web,

535
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:33,230
“udonge" has slowly come to mean

536
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:36,490
the spider's web as well...

537
00:51:38,650 --> 00:51:41,620
Mokki?

538
00:52:06,930 --> 00:52:08,350
All done

539
00:52:09,810 --> 00:52:13,690
Soza, don't be so nervous
It's just acting

540
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:16,820
How will you manage
a real revenge?

541
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:22,700
“Cherry blossoms are blessed
only when they have all fallen"

542
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:26,540
When it's time for a samurai to die,
one hopes to fall gracefully,

543
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:29,200
like these cherry blossoms

544
00:52:29,330 --> 00:52:31,710
Make sure you do,
on your fourth try

545
00:52:32,330 --> 00:52:33,710
“Only the countrymen..."

546
00:52:33,790 --> 00:52:36,170
You're not from here, right?

547
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:40,880
I bet cherry blossoms fall gracefully
'cause they know

548
00:52:41,010 --> 00:52:42,550
they'll bloom next year

549
00:52:43,590 --> 00:52:46,050
Otherwise, they'd never give up

550
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:49,140
A point for Mago

551
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:53,730
"Not exactly,
but not far off, neither"

552
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:55,560
Right, “neither"

553
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:01,030
“Hunger is a terrible..."

554
00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:03,070
You don't really understand any of it

555
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:15,920
A revenge! A revenge!

556
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:21,550
A revenge! A revenge!

557
00:53:21,670 --> 00:53:22,590
How was I?

558
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,180
Just fine

559
00:53:25,890 --> 00:53:26,760
Shit

560
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:29,100
- What?
- Some guys I'd rather not see

561
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:31,930
- What? A big tab?
- Enormous

562
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:35,190
I know, will you take my
"Not so fast" line, too?

563
00:53:35,270 --> 00:53:36,100
Me?

564
00:53:36,230 --> 00:53:39,520
Don't worry, you can do it

565
00:53:42,950 --> 00:53:46,200
"All to avenge this grudge,
my son and I,

566
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:48,530
"rain drenched, windswept,

567
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:51,950
"by the trials and tribulations
of such times..."

568
00:53:53,290 --> 00:53:55,580
"Meeting you like a {\i1}mokki{\i0}
reaching driftwood

569
00:53:55,670 --> 00:53:59,210
“the flowering of the udonge..."

570
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:02,630
“Now fight, and fight fair"

571
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:06,800
"I cut my enemy down in Warrior's
vengeance, not petty motives

572
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:10,560
"Now you deserve revenge"

573
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,310
It's your moment!

574
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:17,900
What's the hold up?

575
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:19,480
Hurry up

576
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:21,230
Kill him

577
00:54:25,490 --> 00:54:26,820
Not so fast!

578
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:33,620
We've heard she avenges
her dead husband

579
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:37,330
In these peaceful times, a fine
example of a warrior's wife

580
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:39,630
To ignore her plight
would disgrace any samurai

581
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:44,010
An excellent chance to showcase
our samurai training

582
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:48,260
Though we may be inadequate,
we offer our assistance

583
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:52,930
A gracious offer, but my son and I,

584
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:55,680
must do this with our own hands...

585
00:54:55,850 --> 00:54:58,690
Listen, I'll strike both his arms

586
00:54:58,940 --> 00:55:00,690
- You, his legs...
- Strike

587
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:04,030
Once he's disabled,
you deliver the deathblow

588
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:44,730
"Not so fast!"

589
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:47,900
So fast

590
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:26,440
{\i1}Coward - Lessons Available{\i0}

591
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:30,900
How about taking his wife
or child hostage?

592
00:56:31,450 --> 00:56:33,120
I can't do that

593
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:37,290
Set his house on fire and
get him as he escapes...

594
00:56:38,910 --> 00:56:39,960
Attack him in bed?

595
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:41,290
Sada san

596
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:43,580
Retribution must befit a samurai...

597
00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:48,800
But if by some miracle you succeed,

598
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:51,300
you'll win vast lands

599
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:56,890
There's got to be a way to avenge him
without risking your life

600
00:56:58,140 --> 00:56:59,810
Are you taking this seriously?

601
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:02,390
I am

602
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:07,320
You sure?
I don't think it's just that you're weak,

603
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:11,320
you've got some other real hesitation
about seeking revenge

604
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:14,660
Oh, I know

605
00:57:15,070 --> 00:57:18,990
You've fallen in love
with that beautiful widow

606
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:20,910
Quite the stud, you widow-killer!

607
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:23,500
"Widow..."

608
00:57:31,170 --> 00:57:34,630
How about a mask?

609
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:55,700
Hello
Oh, you had your baby!

610
00:59:00,510 --> 00:59:01,720
Uncle?

611
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:04,430
Soza

612
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:29,250
His eyes are just like yours

613
00:59:29,330 --> 00:59:30,960
Cut it out, you're wrong

614
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:32,290
What? He's not your child?

615
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:36,420
Uncle! Think about it
I only left home 3 years ago

616
00:59:36,510 --> 00:59:38,970
This boy is at least 8 years old

617
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:41,220
Is that so?

618
00:59:43,970 --> 00:59:46,310
What's your name?

619
00:59:46,430 --> 00:59:47,890
Shinnosuke

620
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:49,060
Your age?

621
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:50,440
Eight

622
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:55,650
Children these days grow up so fast...

623
00:59:56,230 --> 00:59:58,280
I've kept you waiting

624
00:59:58,530 --> 01:00:00,320
Why, thank you

625
01:00:00,490 --> 01:00:04,660
Shinnosuke, come with me
Soza san has important business

626
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:07,750
It's not so important

627
01:00:08,830 --> 01:00:13,420
I feared his spirits might be low

628
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:17,460
Thought I'd take him to a brothel
to distract him

629
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:22,680
But I'm relieved at what I see

630
01:00:23,010 --> 01:00:26,010
There's absolutely no need
for my concerns

631
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:34,310
I worry because he's
always been a little immature,

632
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:35,690
but how's "it" going?

633
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:36,980
Uncle

634
01:00:37,150 --> 01:00:38,530
What "it?"

635
01:00:42,450 --> 01:00:44,320
I mean... with his pen

636
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:48,870
Oh... he's very skillful

637
01:00:48,950 --> 01:00:50,620
Excellent

638
01:00:50,830 --> 01:00:55,710
Onobu across the street says she's
really improved because of him

639
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:58,050
That's amazing

640
01:00:58,210 --> 01:01:00,550
My boy's getting better at it every day

641
01:01:00,630 --> 01:01:03,010
What?
Your boy!

642
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:07,060
Isn't he on the young side?

643
01:01:07,510 --> 01:01:10,680
I was at least 12...

644
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:23,860
What will you do

645
01:01:23,950 --> 01:01:27,580
for your father's anniversary
next month?

646
01:01:28,540 --> 01:01:30,080
Ah, yes...

647
01:01:31,370 --> 01:01:34,250
When they find out "Shy Soza"

648
01:01:34,330 --> 01:01:37,540
has quite a set-up here in Edo,

649
01:01:37,630 --> 01:01:43,430
it won't just be relatives talking,
it'll be the entire clan

650
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:47,220
Watch it, Ma!

651
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:48,430
Shut up!

652
01:01:49,180 --> 01:01:50,560
You useless ass!

653
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:55,600
This place is full of life
Wouldn't mind moving in myself

654
01:01:55,940 --> 01:01:58,940
I swear I'll go
to the fish market tomorrow

655
01:01:59,110 --> 01:02:01,440
Please open up, Onobu

656
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:03,900
Onobu?
Where's Onobu?

657
01:02:03,990 --> 01:02:05,530
Uncle, let's go

658
01:02:05,610 --> 01:02:09,240
But what about Onobu...

659
01:02:34,890 --> 01:02:35,810
Take care

660
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:45,880
What on earth,
have you been up to,

661
01:03:46,010 --> 01:03:49,510
these 3 past years?

662
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:50,890
I am deeply sorry

663
01:03:51,010 --> 01:03:55,470
You think apologies are enough,
you idiot

664
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:59,060
I sent you off to avenge your father,

665
01:03:59,140 --> 01:04:02,900
as if you had succeeded,

666
01:04:03,060 --> 01:04:07,070
you might have slightly improved

667
01:04:07,150 --> 01:04:09,030
your pathetic reputation

668
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:14,660
But not even a single lead...

669
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:18,540
The monthly allowance

670
01:04:18,620 --> 01:04:21,920
the clan provides you

671
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:27,590
is not inconsiderable

672
01:04:28,050 --> 01:04:29,510
Monthly?

673
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:41,100
Brother, there's another reason
why he hasn't located

674
01:04:41,190 --> 01:04:42,770
his enemy...

675
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:44,270
Uncle

676
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:49,190
Our Shy little Soza

677
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:54,200
has made a child
with a beautiful woman

678
01:04:55,330 --> 01:04:58,240
The child is already 8 years old

679
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:03,460
The sword is not merely intended

680
01:05:03,790 --> 01:05:06,460
to inflict wounds and claim lives

681
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:11,970
When swords clash,
life encounters life,

682
01:05:12,090 --> 01:05:15,640
death encounters death,
in a tempestuous conflict,

683
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:18,220
giving birth to a genuine dialogue

684
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:21,980
That is the samurai's joy and sorrow

685
01:05:22,730 --> 01:05:26,810
That is the only path
of the samurai

686
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:31,820
In these peaceful times
which know no war,

687
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:34,950
the samurai must reveal this beauty

688
01:05:35,030 --> 01:05:37,490
to the peasantry...

689
01:05:41,330 --> 01:05:44,420
There are less of them...
than 3 years ago

690
01:05:45,290 --> 01:05:47,420
With war unlikely,

691
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:53,170
they know that fencing is useless
in advancing their career

692
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:59,350
Look, here

693
01:06:01,180 --> 01:06:03,520
Our enemy Kanazawa's,
ancestral home

694
01:06:05,020 --> 01:06:09,150
He'd been living alone
with his invalid mother

695
01:06:09,980 --> 01:06:14,950
Soon after he killed Father, his mother,
unable to face the world,

696
01:06:15,530 --> 01:06:17,370
and passed away...

697
01:06:18,870 --> 01:06:20,620
I never knew

698
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:23,540
How sad for her

699
01:06:24,910 --> 01:06:26,290
How sad?

700
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,000
How can you feel pity, brother?

701
01:06:30,130 --> 01:06:32,050
He got what he deserved

702
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:35,680
But what did his mother
have to do with it?

703
01:06:35,930 --> 01:06:38,050
How can you be so soft?

704
01:06:38,850 --> 01:06:42,810
Have you forgotten
Father's dying wish?

705
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:45,810
I'm sorry

706
01:06:47,230 --> 01:06:49,230
You're "sorry..."

707
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:54,740
You've changed these past 3 years

708
01:06:55,820 --> 01:06:59,070
What sort of life have
you been leading in Edo?

709
01:07:00,410 --> 01:07:03,660
You have no right to pray
at Father's grave

710
01:07:34,610 --> 01:07:38,110
{\i1}Observe my belated vengeance!{\i0}

711
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:55,800
Prepare!

712
01:07:58,800 --> 01:07:59,800
I avenge my father!

713
01:08:18,820 --> 01:08:20,910
Take care of yourself

714
01:08:21,110 --> 01:08:24,410
I've got a lady friend to visit here

715
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:28,160
Listen...

716
01:08:28,540 --> 01:08:31,580
Your father was a prude, with no

717
01:08:31,670 --> 01:08:34,170
enjoyment of life's subtle pleasures,

718
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:38,510
but now that he's gone,
he's left a nice setup for you

719
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:41,930
The gods will punish you
if you waste her

720
01:08:46,060 --> 01:08:50,350
Revenge isn't the only way
to demonstrate your devotion

721
01:08:52,150 --> 01:08:53,190
Bye

722
01:08:55,110 --> 01:08:56,190
Soza

723
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:41,190
Don't you think,
that's overdoing it?

724
01:09:41,570 --> 01:09:43,860
I'm a living creature, too

725
01:09:43,950 --> 01:09:45,990
I deserve a better life

726
01:09:46,070 --> 01:09:50,580
They say a dog's curse
obstructs the birth of the shogun's heir

727
01:09:51,660 --> 01:09:53,210
Maybe he ate one...

728
01:10:01,130 --> 01:10:05,380
Fans, fans for sale

729
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:14,270
Sode san

730
01:10:16,270 --> 01:10:18,440
Why would you be picking flowers?

731
01:10:20,610 --> 01:10:22,280
What about you?

732
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:26,950
They're for my dead mother
I don't have money to buy any

733
01:10:27,450 --> 01:10:29,280
You look after your folks

734
01:10:32,660 --> 01:10:35,460
Say, you're hurt

735
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:38,580
Another fight with gangsters?

736
01:10:40,340 --> 01:10:45,300
You're hopeless. Why do you
always get yourself beat up?

737
01:10:47,550 --> 01:10:49,140
A mystery

738
01:11:04,820 --> 01:11:07,280
Don't you have anyone special?

739
01:11:09,620 --> 01:11:11,620
If I did, would it fill my stomach?

740
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:13,580
It wouldn't fill your stomach,

741
01:11:13,660 --> 01:11:17,160
but if you had someone special,

742
01:11:17,250 --> 01:11:19,670
maybe you'd be a little less reckless

743
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:24,670
You're such a baby, Onobu

744
01:11:25,210 --> 01:11:27,510
You know, having someone special

745
01:11:27,630 --> 01:11:31,260
would only make me more reckless

746
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:34,680
I'm just worried about you

747
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:14,010
Well cleaning, well cleaning

748
01:12:32,820 --> 01:12:34,910
All right pull up

749
01:12:37,330 --> 01:12:38,700
Slowly, slowly

750
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:45,590
All right, release

751
01:12:50,380 --> 01:12:52,430
Release it more

752
01:12:56,470 --> 01:12:58,020
Release it more

753
01:13:00,060 --> 01:13:01,770
A little more

754
01:13:07,900 --> 01:13:09,240
All right, lift it

755
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:23,920
Let's go help

756
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:45,480
Soza!

757
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:19,350
Making New Year's cakes and cleaning
wells are work for a samurai's servant

758
01:14:19,890 --> 01:14:22,850
Never heard of a samurai pulling a rope

759
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:36,530
Look, the landlord's new wife

760
01:14:37,780 --> 01:14:40,700
He sure managed to
get himself a beauty

761
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:45,710
He spent good money buying
her out of a brothel

762
01:14:47,210 --> 01:14:50,380
Not even been 3 years
since the last one died

763
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:53,210
Money does make the world go round

764
01:15:06,770 --> 01:15:09,310
He knows her?

765
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:12,150
The man gets around

766
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:19,070
"Why Sode san,
you're as handsome as ever"

767
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:23,240
"You're looking pretty yourself"

768
01:15:23,410 --> 01:15:26,870
"You mustn't, I'm a wife, now"

769
01:15:33,090 --> 01:15:34,760
You sure married well

770
01:15:36,420 --> 01:15:40,590
A landlord's wife is a long way up
from a humble village

771
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:44,010
It wasn't my choice

772
01:15:45,980 --> 01:15:48,770
You didn't choose
the brothels, either?

773
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:52,940
No woman chooses the brothels

774
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:58,610
Women have it good
Always got a job waiting

775
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:03,370
You really want to hear,
all about how I survived,

776
01:16:04,410 --> 01:16:06,120
these last 15 years?

777
01:16:08,620 --> 01:16:10,120
I'll pass

778
01:16:17,170 --> 01:16:20,470
Why won't you build us
a decent outhouse?

779
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:22,220
Don't be foolish

780
01:16:22,470 --> 01:16:24,930
I'm destroying these tenements
to build new ones

781
01:16:27,470 --> 01:16:29,980
Unfortunately, you'll be ringing in

782
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:33,230
the new year somewhere else

783
01:16:42,110 --> 01:16:43,570
Interesting...

784
01:16:51,290 --> 01:16:55,790
These days, it seems like
my shit's been runny

785
01:16:56,170 --> 01:16:58,670
I'll be with you soon

786
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:00,010
Cut it out, Dad

787
01:17:00,090 --> 01:17:01,510
Can't you see, I'm eating

788
01:17:01,590 --> 01:17:05,140
Shut up! It's none of your business
what I say to my wife

789
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:08,180
Talking about your shit, at this hour!
You're not Mago san

790
01:17:08,270 --> 01:17:12,100
If you're going to fuss,
fuss over the back rent you owe

791
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:17,520
Listen, Onobu, about Kenbo...

792
01:17:17,690 --> 01:17:20,690
No matter how you look at him,
Kenbo's your child

793
01:17:20,860 --> 01:17:25,200
In 10 years, I won't even be able
to tell you apart

794
01:17:26,030 --> 01:17:27,700
I've got my hands full now

795
01:17:27,870 --> 01:17:32,620
I'm in no mood to discuss your shit
with you, Dad! Just shut up!

796
01:17:39,550 --> 01:17:40,670
Here goes!

797
01:17:58,150 --> 01:18:00,030
Sode san's out

798
01:18:01,190 --> 01:18:04,030
Please, don't come here

799
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:07,490
Why not?

800
01:18:07,620 --> 01:18:10,740
Because...
whatever happened in the past,

801
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:14,540
I don't think Sode san
can find happiness with you

802
01:18:15,250 --> 01:18:17,170
You get right to the point,
don't you

803
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:21,590
And you think he'll find
happiness with you?

804
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:28,260
I just don't want to spend
my whole life in this dump

805
01:18:29,890 --> 01:18:33,100
Listen
Remember this

806
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:38,770
When you leave, it'll be because
you're worse off than you are now

807
01:19:10,850 --> 01:19:14,310
They say there's a place over
in Nakano where they feed strays

808
01:19:14,810 --> 01:19:17,140
If we get thrown out of here,
we can go

809
01:19:17,270 --> 01:19:19,810
Fool. They only feed dogs,
not humans

810
01:19:19,940 --> 01:19:22,730
I was born in the Year of the Dog
Still no good?

811
01:19:23,110 --> 01:19:27,150
We're less than dogs
to the Shogun anyway

812
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:28,490
Pisses me off

813
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:56,770
With so many of us, how come

814
01:19:56,930 --> 01:19:59,770
we can't figure out how many men
guard their mansion!

815
01:19:59,850 --> 01:20:02,190
There has to be a way to figure it out

816
01:20:05,780 --> 01:20:10,860
Kichiemon
Don't you have an idea?

817
01:20:13,490 --> 01:20:17,700
The volume of crap in the outhouse
should give us a good idea

818
01:20:17,790 --> 01:20:18,960
Crap?

819
01:20:19,870 --> 01:20:23,540
Spoken like a true ex-peasant

820
01:20:24,710 --> 01:20:25,880
Excuse me

821
01:20:29,420 --> 01:20:30,840
Who are you?

822
01:20:31,390 --> 01:20:35,390
What do you mean by that?
I'm here to collect your rent

823
01:20:36,890 --> 01:20:39,020
The question is, who are {\i1}you{\i0}?

824
01:20:39,940 --> 01:20:41,850
We're ill... ill...

825
01:20:42,650 --> 01:20:43,900
You're ill...?

826
01:20:44,060 --> 01:20:47,070
No, no,
we have no ill intentions

827
01:20:47,190 --> 01:20:48,860
And nothing to do with Kira...

828
01:20:48,940 --> 01:20:51,360
We're just wounded is all

829
01:20:53,240 --> 01:20:54,910
There are quite a few of you...

830
01:20:57,370 --> 01:20:59,250
Chief retainer arrived from Kyoto!

831
01:20:59,410 --> 01:21:00,830
Oishi-sama's here!

832
01:21:00,910 --> 01:21:02,420
All right, let's go

833
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:04,250
Finally!

834
01:21:09,340 --> 01:21:11,720
Hey, wait, that's my umbrella!

835
01:21:12,590 --> 01:21:13,930
Let's have a look

836
01:21:15,100 --> 01:21:16,760
Oh, no

837
01:21:18,390 --> 01:21:20,770
Your business is really doing well

838
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:25,360
No charge

839
01:21:26,980 --> 01:21:29,230
But can you wait for the rent?

840
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:31,780
No extra charge

841
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:34,780
I'm begging you

842
01:21:34,950 --> 01:21:38,450
If you take that knife, Dad can't
work at the fish market anymore

843
01:21:38,620 --> 01:21:41,120
You owe 6 months' back rent!

844
01:21:41,290 --> 01:21:43,250
Besides, he never works anyway

845
01:21:47,460 --> 01:21:48,550
Hey there

846
01:22:01,100 --> 01:22:04,980
If all my tenants were prospective
avengers, I'd actually collect rent

847
01:22:07,730 --> 01:22:10,820
You're welcome to move in
to my new tenement

848
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:15,320
Um...

849
01:22:16,820 --> 01:22:18,780
Can't you hold off...

850
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:23,000
Let us all live here a while longer

851
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:28,590
"Let us all live here?"

852
01:22:28,840 --> 01:22:32,590
A fine phrase,
but you're dreaming

853
01:22:33,550 --> 01:22:37,340
No wonder they all
take advantage of you

854
01:22:38,850 --> 01:22:43,680
Don't talk to me like that, when you've
never worked a day in your life

855
01:22:44,850 --> 01:22:49,690
Or are you willing to cover
everyone's back rent?

856
01:23:07,540 --> 01:23:09,000
If you live here, you pay

857
01:23:11,380 --> 01:23:14,720
My, my, the landlord making
the rounds himself in this rain

858
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:21,720
My tenants are more likely to stay
home in this weather. Easier to collect

859
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:27,310
Besides, I can't risk sending
my gorgeous wife here

860
01:23:27,390 --> 01:23:30,060
Who knows what might happen

861
01:23:32,150 --> 01:23:34,070
What do you mean, "Risk?"

862
01:23:35,570 --> 01:23:39,070
I heard
You're childhood friends

863
01:23:39,990 --> 01:23:41,410
You were engaged

864
01:23:41,580 --> 01:23:43,660
What's that got to do with you?

865
01:23:43,870 --> 01:23:45,870
Oh, how scary

866
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:49,080
Time to be going

867
01:23:50,250 --> 01:23:53,550
Too bad, but she's my wife

868
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:56,210
I won't let you touch her

869
01:24:03,720 --> 01:24:06,060
This fatty meat...

870
01:24:06,850 --> 01:24:10,100
from that other white one was
better than this black one...

871
01:24:16,820 --> 01:24:18,700
Four of you eating from one pot?

872
01:24:18,780 --> 01:24:21,450
You're all wet

873
01:24:21,780 --> 01:24:23,530
Have a bowl and warm up

874
01:24:23,740 --> 01:24:25,740
Don't mind if I do

875
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:34,130
By the way, that German or
English doctor, Kaempfer,

876
01:24:34,250 --> 01:24:35,800
who visited the Shogun,

877
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:39,220
sold him an elixir for immortality
for 20,000 {\i1}ryo{\i0}

878
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:40,300
20,000 ryo!

879
01:24:40,470 --> 01:24:44,050
I hear it's made of mermaid flesh

880
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:45,810
Wonder if it works

881
01:24:46,470 --> 01:24:48,310
20,000 ryo is fantastic...

882
01:24:48,390 --> 01:24:51,980
He's got no children so
he's got to live as long as he can

883
01:24:52,150 --> 01:24:55,650
Sure is greedy
Just like a landlord I know

884
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:58,280
20,000 ryo, is like...

885
01:25:01,490 --> 01:25:03,910
20,000 ryo is...

886
01:25:07,700 --> 01:25:09,620
Hey... this...

887
01:25:09,700 --> 01:25:12,330
Mind your manners
Sit when you eat

888
01:25:12,420 --> 01:25:13,830
What kind of meat is this?

889
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:16,800
This? What was it?

890
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:18,000
This is... you know...

891
01:25:18,130 --> 01:25:20,510
You see it riding on that platform...

892
01:25:20,590 --> 01:25:21,510
It's dog

893
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:25,010
Tastes pretty good

894
01:25:25,510 --> 01:25:27,850
Today, it's a little
tougher than usual

895
01:25:28,010 --> 01:25:29,520
Than usual?

896
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:32,690
You know what'll happen
if the Shogun finds out!

897
01:25:33,020 --> 01:25:35,190
He won't,
if you keep your mouth shut

898
01:25:35,310 --> 01:25:38,190
Besides, you ate some, too

899
01:25:40,530 --> 01:25:44,660
Hey, you can't eat and run
Leave the knife in payment

900
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:48,030
I'll drive you out!
Every last one of you!

901
01:25:51,370 --> 01:25:52,830
Thanks for your patronage

902
01:25:52,910 --> 01:25:54,790
Come back soon!

903
01:26:09,470 --> 01:26:11,220
It's been 5 days now

904
01:26:12,020 --> 01:26:14,480
Can't even go to work

905
01:26:14,850 --> 01:26:18,060
You hardly work
even when the sun's shining

906
01:26:19,150 --> 01:26:21,900
But when it keeps pouring this way,

907
01:26:22,070 --> 01:26:24,740
it even makes you feel poorly

908
01:26:25,570 --> 01:26:26,660
Right?

909
01:26:27,240 --> 01:26:30,580
I haven't been able to shit at all

910
01:26:31,620 --> 01:26:33,000
How long?

911
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:35,580
It's 4 days now

912
01:26:35,670 --> 01:26:38,420
It's 5 days for me

913
01:26:39,170 --> 01:26:43,010
Look how bloated I am...

914
01:26:47,890 --> 01:26:48,930
See?

915
01:26:50,220 --> 01:26:51,430
You're right

916
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:30,970
What is it?

917
01:27:35,100 --> 01:27:37,810
I've got no business with you

918
01:27:45,610 --> 01:27:46,950
Move

919
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:49,780
Are you going to disappear again?

920
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:13,430
I hate the rain

921
01:28:17,100 --> 01:28:22,480
When it rains,
I always remember that night

922
01:28:23,980 --> 01:28:28,280
I see your face against
that bloody ceiling

923
01:28:30,610 --> 01:28:33,200
I should've died, too, back then

924
01:28:34,370 --> 01:28:35,370
If I had...

925
01:28:35,490 --> 01:28:39,370
Is that how you've always felt?
How sad

926
01:28:41,750 --> 01:28:43,170
Cut it out

927
01:28:45,550 --> 01:28:48,380
You're not the only one
whose folks nearly killed you

928
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:50,220
What?

929
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:55,390
What do you want me to do?

930
01:29:06,230 --> 01:29:07,730
Come with me...

931
01:29:11,910 --> 01:29:14,660
Somewhere far away...

932
01:29:29,090 --> 01:29:30,760
Of course not...

933
01:29:32,680 --> 01:29:36,220
It's too late for that

934
01:30:17,050 --> 01:30:21,140
I've got his baby,
inside my belly

935
01:30:27,060 --> 01:30:28,480
Is that so?

936
01:30:30,820 --> 01:30:32,650
You're having a baby

937
01:30:39,830 --> 01:30:42,410
You'll have a new family

938
01:30:45,500 --> 01:30:47,330
That's good

939
01:30:59,180 --> 01:31:00,510
Forget it

940
01:31:09,560 --> 01:31:11,690
You have your baby,

941
01:31:13,230 --> 01:31:15,150
become a mother,

942
01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:18,870
get old,

943
01:31:20,870 --> 01:31:23,540
and go all wrinkly

944
01:31:24,870 --> 01:31:27,540
Can I watch you the whole time?

945
01:32:04,870 --> 01:32:10,580
You live in a filthy dump,
dressed up like a samurai

946
01:32:10,710 --> 01:32:14,050
You'll never amount
to anything, anyway

947
01:32:14,130 --> 01:32:16,420
What's so great about
being a samurai?

948
01:32:20,090 --> 01:32:23,560
We were born better than you

949
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:27,560
Who says so?
Bring him here

950
01:32:27,640 --> 01:32:28,600
What!

951
01:32:28,730 --> 01:32:29,940
Get 'em!

952
01:32:34,020 --> 01:32:35,110
Wait!

953
01:32:41,530 --> 01:32:42,620
What's with them?

954
01:32:42,700 --> 01:32:43,620
Strange

955
01:32:43,740 --> 01:32:45,030
Let's go

956
01:33:00,630 --> 01:33:01,720
Yoshibo

957
01:33:07,770 --> 01:33:12,150
Before you said, “What's
so great about being a samurai?"

958
01:33:12,310 --> 01:33:16,940
That's what Daddy says,
when he drinks

959
01:33:17,650 --> 01:33:21,150
I see... your father does

960
01:33:22,990 --> 01:33:26,990
Daddy tells me to run from fights

961
01:33:27,830 --> 01:33:32,580
But I hate running,
so I had a different idea

962
01:33:34,460 --> 01:33:39,300
People who are truly strong,
don't fight without a reason

963
01:33:40,630 --> 01:33:44,840
Your father must be
a man of great character

964
01:33:45,010 --> 01:33:46,140
Yeah

965
01:33:46,850 --> 01:33:48,430
Excuse me

966
01:33:49,020 --> 01:33:50,520
Oh, it's Mom

967
01:33:53,310 --> 01:33:54,190
Hello

968
01:33:56,810 --> 01:33:59,030
I live across the way

969
01:33:59,360 --> 01:34:02,360
I'm sorry
they've caused you trouble

970
01:34:03,320 --> 01:34:05,030
Hey, Yoshi!

971
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:06,990
Were you fighting again?

972
01:34:07,080 --> 01:34:09,450
What did you promise your father?

973
01:34:09,540 --> 01:34:12,210
I wasn't in a fight, right?

974
01:34:13,160 --> 01:34:14,460
Hi, Shinbo

975
01:34:14,540 --> 01:34:17,460
Your mother said
she has a few more customers to visit

976
01:34:17,540 --> 01:34:19,710
Please wait for her a little longer

977
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:23,380
It's all right
I'll wait until she returns

978
01:34:24,300 --> 01:34:25,840
I'll be going then

979
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:29,680
Come play with my son again

980
01:34:30,310 --> 01:34:31,220
Tomorrow

981
01:34:34,230 --> 01:34:36,690
I wonder if Daddy will
come home early

982
01:34:36,770 --> 01:34:38,980
I wonder

983
01:34:39,070 --> 01:34:41,900
He said he'd make me a wheel

984
01:34:42,360 --> 01:34:43,740
Won't that be nice

985
01:34:48,450 --> 01:34:51,410
There's a portrait of my father

986
01:34:52,250 --> 01:34:54,210
Would you like to see it?

987
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:56,670
Of your father?

988
01:35:06,340 --> 01:35:09,930
I know she looks at it
secretly at night

989
01:35:15,230 --> 01:35:16,270
Here it is

990
01:35:20,860 --> 01:35:25,900
{\i1}WANTED{\i0}

991
01:35:28,280 --> 01:35:30,450
Doesn't he look strong?

992
01:35:35,160 --> 01:35:37,540
Don't tell Mother

993
01:35:45,970 --> 01:35:48,220
What's wrong, Soza san?

994
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:42,270
I fell into the crap...

995
01:37:04,590 --> 01:37:09,050
I... may be dressed up
as a simple drug seller,

996
01:37:09,130 --> 01:37:12,720
but in fact I'm a samurai

997
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:16,640
I say samurai, but I'm just
a foot soldier, a former peasant

998
01:37:17,560 --> 01:37:19,180
I see

999
01:37:22,770 --> 01:37:26,520
So all I think about is wanting
to die a samurai's death

1000
01:37:27,400 --> 01:37:30,030
Then I'll finally be a real samurai

1001
01:37:30,110 --> 01:37:34,740
That way, my son can truly
live as a samurai's son

1002
01:37:35,370 --> 01:37:39,410
I can't leave him any land or money...

1003
01:37:39,910 --> 01:37:42,580
So it's the least I can do

1004
01:38:02,100 --> 01:38:03,850
Kichiemon san,

1005
01:38:07,110 --> 01:38:10,610
who taught you how to play Go?

1006
01:38:11,610 --> 01:38:15,620
After I began carrying swords,
however badly

1007
01:38:16,410 --> 01:38:20,620
Everyone told me it would
make me more like a samurai

1008
01:38:21,120 --> 01:38:22,790
I learned by watching

1009
01:38:29,130 --> 01:38:31,800
My father taught me

1010
01:38:33,590 --> 01:38:35,380
When I was a child

1011
01:38:40,770 --> 01:38:42,770
I'd forgotten that...

1012
01:38:50,020 --> 01:38:53,490
I learned more from my father
than fencing...

1013
01:38:57,620 --> 01:38:59,280
You're very lucky

1014
01:39:04,460 --> 01:39:05,790
I'm grateful

1015
01:39:13,710 --> 01:39:15,680
Truly grateful

1016
01:39:25,850 --> 01:39:28,940
I'll pass on the basics of Go
to Shinbo, soon

1017
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:36,840
A revenge, a revenge...
After a 3 year search for my enemy,

1018
01:40:36,920 --> 01:40:42,090
I, Aoki Sozaemon of the Matsumoto clan,
have finally avenged my father

1019
01:40:42,260 --> 01:40:45,600
When cut down, a man...

1020
01:40:45,720 --> 01:40:49,440
The single, mortal blow ran
from the right side to his back

1021
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:51,600
What incredible swordplay...

1022
01:40:51,730 --> 01:40:55,570
My vengeance was a warrior's revenge
Bear no grudge

1023
01:40:56,440 --> 01:40:59,110
Do you hate the man
who killed your father?

1024
01:41:01,610 --> 01:41:02,910
I hate...

1025
01:41:04,370 --> 01:41:05,910
I hate him

1026
01:42:12,020 --> 01:42:15,350
The other day, your son
stopped a fight...

1027
01:42:17,480 --> 01:42:20,030
He saved Shinbo,
who lives in our neighbourhood

1028
01:42:22,990 --> 01:42:24,660
Our Yoshi...

1029
01:42:26,030 --> 01:42:27,530
Is that so?

1030
01:42:30,620 --> 01:42:32,540
How old is he?

1031
01:42:34,370 --> 01:42:35,710
Seven

1032
01:42:37,210 --> 01:42:40,050
He's not mine by birth...

1033
01:42:53,230 --> 01:42:54,890
Why don't you

1034
01:42:56,520 --> 01:42:59,570
start sending him to my private
school next year

1035
01:43:03,440 --> 01:43:06,070
It would make Shinbo happy

1036
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:36,390
A repeat performance of
our spring revenge play

1037
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:37,600
Very cool

1038
01:43:37,730 --> 01:43:39,230
It's so like Soza san

1039
01:43:39,310 --> 01:43:40,940
But, isn't it risky?

1040
01:43:41,070 --> 01:43:43,110
We screw up, we'll be in big trouble

1041
01:43:43,190 --> 01:43:45,400
But if we pull it off,
we'll get at least 100 ryo

1042
01:43:45,490 --> 01:43:46,280
100 ryo!

1043
01:43:46,740 --> 01:43:50,950
With 100 ryo we can pay off all
our back rent

1044
01:43:51,080 --> 01:43:55,540
and have some left
That's 14 ryo each

1045
01:43:55,790 --> 01:43:56,710
I'm in!

1046
01:43:56,790 --> 01:43:57,620
I'm in, too!

1047
01:43:58,250 --> 01:43:59,290
Me, too

1048
01:44:03,460 --> 01:44:05,630
I want you all to play
the excited passersby

1049
01:44:05,800 --> 01:44:08,800
Tomekichi san,
I need you to find a pig

1050
01:44:08,930 --> 01:44:12,930
Can I please say that line
"Now you deserve revenge"?

1051
01:44:13,010 --> 01:44:14,140
May I?

1052
01:44:15,390 --> 01:44:18,980
A samurai holds Justice
dearer than life itself

1053
01:44:19,100 --> 01:44:21,110
Composed of Self and Beauty

1054
01:44:21,190 --> 01:44:23,480
He defends Justice
and defending...

1055
01:44:23,570 --> 01:44:26,320
Enough of your crap
Eat shit!

1056
01:44:26,490 --> 01:44:27,440
No,

1057
01:44:27,530 --> 01:44:30,410
even I won't eat shit
until it's become rice cakes

1058
01:44:30,490 --> 01:44:33,660
Listen, "Eat shit" doesn't actually mean...

1059
01:44:33,740 --> 01:44:36,790
If you really want money,
it has to be real

1060
01:44:36,870 --> 01:44:39,000
Turning it into a pantomime...

1061
01:44:39,080 --> 01:44:42,170
The whole point is, it's fake

1062
01:44:42,330 --> 01:44:44,420
I wouldn't dare kill someone

1063
01:44:44,500 --> 01:44:49,840
"Tall tales make flowers bloom
but bear no fruit"

1064
01:44:50,010 --> 01:44:52,850
That's what they used to say

1065
01:44:53,680 --> 01:44:57,430
Well, I say, let's make
a field of flowers bloom

1066
01:44:57,520 --> 01:44:58,980
Down to 9 ryo...

1067
01:44:59,060 --> 01:45:03,360
Don't you hate him!
Don't you despise your father's killer!

1068
01:45:04,690 --> 01:45:05,860
No,

1069
01:45:06,280 --> 01:45:07,690
you're all wrong

1070
01:45:07,820 --> 01:45:11,030
Each of us has our own
method of hating

1071
01:45:11,200 --> 01:45:15,530
Soza san is...
Making that hatred...

1072
01:45:15,660 --> 01:45:18,040
It's larger than...

1073
01:45:18,500 --> 01:45:21,040
You see...

1074
01:45:21,870 --> 01:45:23,210
That's it!

1075
01:45:23,290 --> 01:45:26,380
Soza san has turned shit
into rice cakes

1076
01:45:26,500 --> 01:45:30,340
Taken the shit inside him
and made it rice cakes...

1077
01:45:30,420 --> 01:45:31,800
Osae san

1078
01:45:31,930 --> 01:45:34,720
"Shit this and shit that,"
is Mago's line

1079
01:45:39,020 --> 01:45:41,560
Turning shit into rice cakes
inside you...

1080
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:44,980
Amazing!

1081
01:45:45,060 --> 01:45:48,070
No, Mago, it's not like that

1082
01:45:49,150 --> 01:45:52,400
There's no way you can fake a corpse?

1083
01:45:52,910 --> 01:45:54,870
Leave it all to me

1084
01:45:54,950 --> 01:45:56,330
I've got enough bones

1085
01:45:56,410 --> 01:45:58,740
No, any fool can see
they're dog bones

1086
01:45:58,910 --> 01:46:00,500
You can't fool a temple priest

1087
01:46:00,580 --> 01:46:04,920
Leave it to me
I'll take it to my family's temple

1088
01:46:07,090 --> 01:46:08,550
Your father's a priest?

1089
01:46:08,630 --> 01:46:09,590
A priest?

1090
01:46:09,760 --> 01:46:11,760
Yeah, didn't I tell you?

1091
01:46:11,920 --> 01:46:12,930
The {\i1}Jodo{\i0} sect

1092
01:46:17,760 --> 01:46:18,760
All right

1093
01:46:19,260 --> 01:46:24,100
If you insist,
I will help you with this plan

1094
01:46:25,480 --> 01:46:27,560
Should we succeed,

1095
01:46:27,650 --> 01:46:31,280
recommend me to your clan

1096
01:46:31,440 --> 01:46:33,070
- Your real motive!
- What a nerve...

1097
01:46:33,150 --> 01:46:35,860
Can't I at least say "Not so fast!"
I'll get it right

1098
01:46:35,950 --> 01:46:38,580
You always mix things up
Shut up

1099
01:46:38,660 --> 01:46:41,080
Yeah, we don't need you to mess it up

1100
01:46:41,160 --> 01:46:45,420
Mago san, I'd like you to
play the lead in this revenge

1101
01:46:54,430 --> 01:46:56,140
A revenge!

1102
01:46:56,840 --> 01:47:00,220
Took him 3 years
but he avenged his father

1103
01:47:00,310 --> 01:47:01,810
What incredible swordplay!

1104
01:47:01,890 --> 01:47:03,140
Incredible

1105
01:47:03,310 --> 01:47:05,140
A revenge!
A revenge!

1106
01:47:12,730 --> 01:47:16,740
I, Aoki Sozaemon have avenged
my father's murderer,

1107
01:47:16,820 --> 01:47:20,160
I, Hirano Jirozaemon,
did duly witness this revenge

1108
01:47:20,240 --> 01:47:21,160
Deadly combat

1109
01:47:22,290 --> 01:47:23,330
Well done!

1110
01:47:24,330 --> 01:47:25,660
It was deadly combat

1111
01:47:33,300 --> 01:47:36,590
The notices have been posted

1112
01:47:38,010 --> 01:47:40,850
In these peaceful times...

1113
01:47:40,970 --> 01:47:43,350
a truly commendable spirit

1114
01:47:44,560 --> 01:47:47,940
Now for the autopsy...

1115
01:47:48,810 --> 01:47:52,190
The mortal blow ran from his
right side to his back

1116
01:47:52,270 --> 01:47:53,690
Felled by a single blow

1117
01:47:53,820 --> 01:47:56,700
When cut down,

1118
01:47:56,820 --> 01:47:59,700
a man bleeds so tremendously...
I was shocked

1119
01:47:59,820 --> 01:48:00,700
Oto! Intestines!

1120
01:48:00,870 --> 01:48:01,870
You're right

1121
01:48:03,910 --> 01:48:05,700
How awful...

1122
01:48:08,080 --> 01:48:09,540
What will you do?

1123
01:48:10,540 --> 01:48:12,170
Do you still want to see it?

1124
01:48:23,560 --> 01:48:24,520
My beloved!

1125
01:48:24,600 --> 01:48:25,680
Daddy!

1126
01:48:35,860 --> 01:48:36,990
Darling!

1127
01:48:37,070 --> 01:48:38,530
Daddy!

1128
01:48:42,820 --> 01:48:45,080
He's got a red mark that
matches this likeness

1129
01:48:47,370 --> 01:48:50,500
This avenging was
a warrior's revenge

1130
01:48:51,330 --> 01:48:52,920
Bear no grudge

1131
01:48:56,630 --> 01:49:01,680
Shinbo, do you hate the man
who killed your father?

1132
01:49:01,760 --> 01:49:02,930
I hate him

1133
01:49:03,600 --> 01:49:05,430
Do you want revenge?

1134
01:49:05,510 --> 01:49:06,520
Yeah

1135
01:49:08,600 --> 01:49:12,270
Your mother feels exactly as you do

1136
01:49:12,770 --> 01:49:16,780
So I can't tell you not to hate him

1137
01:49:17,860 --> 01:49:19,400
But you see...

1138
01:49:20,610 --> 01:49:25,780
If all your father left us...

1139
01:49:26,580 --> 01:49:29,290
was hatred,

1140
01:49:29,750 --> 01:49:31,750
how would he feel?

1141
01:49:32,960 --> 01:49:37,250
It might make him feel sad

1142
01:49:39,760 --> 01:49:41,550
So, now,

1143
01:49:42,630 --> 01:49:45,300
let's take what he left behind

1144
01:49:45,890 --> 01:49:51,140
and gradually make it
into something better

1145
01:49:56,610 --> 01:50:00,610
I'll help you, Shinbo

1146
01:50:01,360 --> 01:50:06,120
Will you help me, too?

1147
01:50:06,990 --> 01:50:11,160
Yeah, I'll help you
I'll play Daddy's part, too

1148
01:50:29,930 --> 01:50:35,980
That's right,
J-I-R-O-Z-A-E-M-O-N

1149
01:50:52,500 --> 01:50:53,870
It worked, it worked

1150
01:50:53,960 --> 01:50:55,500
I can't believe we pulled it off

1151
01:50:55,580 --> 01:50:57,880
That idiot said,
“Bury him with respect"

1152
01:51:02,460 --> 01:51:04,550
Otokichi, why are you crying?

1153
01:51:04,680 --> 01:51:07,800
Because Osae san and Shinbo...

1154
01:51:07,890 --> 01:51:09,850
Idiot, they were acting

1155
01:51:09,930 --> 01:51:12,220
But still...

1156
01:51:12,600 --> 01:51:14,390
Hey, Mago, you can stop now

1157
01:51:14,480 --> 01:51:17,060
Somebody pull off the matting

1158
01:51:18,560 --> 01:51:19,690
He's asleep

1159
01:51:20,610 --> 01:51:22,230
Seven ryo and 2 pence...

1160
01:52:42,230 --> 01:52:44,610
No guts spurting out

1161
01:52:48,700 --> 01:52:50,160
It was a single mortal blow

1162
01:52:58,790 --> 01:53:01,830
Too much noise to
get any sleep tonight

1163
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:16,350
Well, all that rain,
I couldn't go out

1164
01:53:16,470 --> 01:53:20,770
I was stuck inside for so long...
Right?

1165
01:53:21,850 --> 01:53:23,610
That's how it is

1166
01:53:24,060 --> 01:53:26,860
What do you mean?
You call that an answer?

1167
01:53:26,940 --> 01:53:29,360
Don't ruin the celebrations

1168
01:53:29,530 --> 01:53:31,780
If we live together,
we halve the rent

1169
01:53:31,860 --> 01:53:32,860
Live together!

1170
01:53:32,990 --> 01:53:35,700
Of course, we're getting married

1171
01:53:35,870 --> 01:53:37,790
I'm moving in with Oto san, too?

1172
01:53:37,870 --> 01:53:42,120
Sure, why not, Onobu
You and Otokichi will be siblings

1173
01:53:42,210 --> 01:53:44,880
No, not siblings...

1174
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:48,630
In any event, let's have a toast

1175
01:53:51,930 --> 01:53:53,550
Congratulations

1176
01:53:53,890 --> 01:53:55,300
Not for me

1177
01:53:57,220 --> 01:53:58,720
Congratulations

1178
01:53:59,430 --> 01:54:01,480
Suzuta ran off?

1179
01:54:01,560 --> 01:54:03,730
What's going on?
That's news to me

1180
01:54:06,230 --> 01:54:08,900
"My mother, long bed-ridden
in illness,

1181
01:54:09,030 --> 01:54:13,490
"has fallen into a bad condition
and truly needs..."

1182
01:54:13,570 --> 01:54:15,240
A sick mother, huh

1183
01:54:15,320 --> 01:54:16,240
News to me

1184
01:54:16,410 --> 01:54:18,580
"If you commanded me to leave
my mother,

1185
01:54:18,700 --> 01:54:22,750
"it would be like abandoning
a part of myself..."

1186
01:54:23,670 --> 01:54:26,750
Says his mother's more important
than revenge

1187
01:54:27,130 --> 01:54:29,380
On the eve of avenging,
he loses nerve

1188
01:54:29,460 --> 01:54:31,260
He disgraces all samurai!

1189
01:54:32,420 --> 01:54:34,260
Hey, Terasaka

1190
01:54:34,930 --> 01:54:36,600
How many remain?

1191
01:54:36,890 --> 01:54:40,430
This month, Yano san,
Seo san, Mori san,

1192
01:54:40,600 --> 01:54:42,390
and Suzuta san have left our company

1193
01:54:42,770 --> 01:54:44,190
We now number some 50...

1194
01:54:44,270 --> 01:54:46,400
This is why I told you...

1195
01:54:47,940 --> 01:54:53,190
We must strike now. Who knows
how many will stay into the new year

1196
01:54:57,780 --> 01:54:59,950
Now, your dojo back home will flourish

1197
01:55:00,080 --> 01:55:03,620
All's well in the neighbourhood and
I can head off to your clan as well

1198
01:55:03,710 --> 01:55:07,290
The wedding within
this neighbourhood count to...

1199
01:55:07,380 --> 01:55:09,790
One, two, three...

1200
01:55:12,130 --> 01:55:13,720
Eight marriages

1201
01:55:16,340 --> 01:55:18,220
- How was I as the lead?
- Oh, excellent

1202
01:55:18,300 --> 01:55:19,300
Really?

1203
01:55:24,730 --> 01:55:28,610
Now with Otokichi and Onobu
under the same roof

1204
01:55:28,690 --> 01:55:31,820
You fool, we're only siblings

1205
01:55:33,490 --> 01:55:37,160
Which means, if I can stand
having you as my brother,

1206
01:55:37,320 --> 01:55:39,820
I can take Onobu as my wife?

1207
01:55:40,280 --> 01:55:41,950
What an idea...

1208
01:55:42,700 --> 01:55:44,620
As her brother, I can't allow that

1209
01:55:44,700 --> 01:55:46,500
You're a mere trash collector

1210
01:55:46,620 --> 01:55:49,630
If only it hadn't rained so much...

1211
01:55:50,670 --> 01:55:52,000
Mom...

1212
01:56:29,710 --> 01:56:32,880
So we end up
attacking them in their sleep

1213
01:56:33,880 --> 01:56:35,210
How pathetic

1214
01:57:35,570 --> 01:57:37,280
News! News!

1215
01:57:37,530 --> 01:57:39,610
A revenge!

1216
01:57:39,860 --> 01:57:42,070
A revenge!

1217
01:57:43,110 --> 01:57:45,450
This chief Oishi's amazing

1218
01:57:45,580 --> 01:57:48,040
Acted the lady's man
to fool the enemy

1219
01:57:48,120 --> 01:57:51,410
They say news of Aoki Sozaemon's
revenge made him tougher

1220
01:57:51,500 --> 01:57:56,130
Says they figured out the number of
guards by the privy. Sure original

1221
01:57:56,880 --> 01:58:00,720
That noodle shop owner
is the chicken samurai who took off,

1222
01:58:00,840 --> 01:58:02,220
three months before it happened

1223
01:58:02,300 --> 01:58:05,970
No wonder his noodle broth
tasted like chicken stock!

1224
01:58:06,140 --> 01:58:08,810
{\i1}Chicken samurai{\i0}

1225
01:58:10,270 --> 01:58:13,310
Sweet revenge buns here!

1226
01:58:15,610 --> 01:58:16,980
Don't miss out!

1227
01:58:21,690 --> 01:58:22,740
Listen up!

1228
01:58:22,820 --> 01:58:27,490
Here's the place where
Dr. Onodera, the 6th most important

1229
01:58:27,620 --> 01:58:30,950
of the 46 avengers,
lived in hiding

1230
01:58:31,830 --> 01:58:36,250
Preparing for death, he wrote
many letters to his wife in Kyoto

1231
01:58:36,330 --> 01:58:40,800
He sent her this poem
the day before the revenge

1232
01:58:40,880 --> 01:58:42,010
Listen up

1233
01:58:42,590 --> 01:58:46,510
“Thoughts once conveyed,

1234
01:58:46,590 --> 01:58:49,850
"in parting,
seem yet unspoken"

1235
01:58:50,010 --> 01:58:54,100
He thought he had told her
everything he had to say,

1236
01:58:54,190 --> 01:58:58,520
at this final parting,
he fears much remains unsaid

1237
01:58:59,020 --> 01:59:02,530
Enough to make a grown man cry

1238
01:59:03,070 --> 01:59:06,950
I always knew there was
something noble about him,

1239
01:59:07,030 --> 01:59:09,200
and I always refused his money

1240
01:59:10,910 --> 01:59:13,710
Buy some sweet revenge buns

1241
01:59:16,830 --> 01:59:17,960
Pay to see his house

1242
01:59:18,080 --> 01:59:19,290
Look, there he is

1243
01:59:19,380 --> 01:59:22,380
Mentor to the 46 avengers

1244
01:59:25,720 --> 01:59:27,010
Welcome home

1245
01:59:47,360 --> 01:59:48,990
What a result!

1246
01:59:49,070 --> 01:59:51,240
There's no result,
we've done no harm

1247
01:59:51,370 --> 01:59:52,990
It's those 46 samurai who did harm

1248
01:59:53,080 --> 01:59:54,580
That's what I think, too

1249
01:59:54,750 --> 01:59:55,710
What they did was bad?

1250
01:59:55,790 --> 01:59:58,330
Of course it was,
a sneak attack in the night

1251
01:59:58,420 --> 02:00:02,250
The whole swarm of them killing
a poor old man,

1252
02:00:02,420 --> 02:00:03,710
that's cheating

1253
02:00:03,800 --> 02:00:06,260
But the landlord's getting rich

1254
02:00:06,380 --> 02:00:09,260
Those sweet buns marked "Loyalty"
are selling like hot cakes

1255
02:00:09,430 --> 02:00:12,510
Mom's all excited about
opening a street front shop

1256
02:00:12,600 --> 02:00:16,680
Where on earth can
that coward be hiding?

1257
02:00:17,020 --> 02:00:19,400
Maybe he's hiding in the shit pile

1258
02:00:19,480 --> 02:00:21,360
Just a foot soldier after all...

1259
02:00:25,030 --> 02:00:26,530
I don't see what's funny

1260
02:00:27,280 --> 02:00:29,280
What's a shit pile got to do
with a foot soldier?

1261
02:00:30,030 --> 02:00:31,740
I was putting on my attack robes,

1262
02:00:33,580 --> 02:00:37,870
when I remembered that Soza san
had learned to play Go from his father

1263
02:00:37,960 --> 02:00:39,460
Yeah, both are black and white

1264
02:00:39,580 --> 02:00:40,630
Sada san!

1265
02:00:41,880 --> 02:00:46,460
I realized I'd never taught
my son to make straw sandals...

1266
02:00:46,630 --> 02:00:48,300
And that thought...

1267
02:00:48,420 --> 02:00:51,970
See, Soza san saved
Terasaka san

1268
02:00:56,270 --> 02:00:57,480
Um...

1269
02:01:00,350 --> 02:01:02,150
What! What do you want?

1270
02:01:02,310 --> 02:01:04,610
A word with master Terasaka

1271
02:01:06,360 --> 02:01:07,320
You ask him

1272
02:01:07,400 --> 02:01:08,820
No, you do it

1273
02:01:09,360 --> 02:01:10,490
What the hell is it?

1274
02:01:11,450 --> 02:01:16,410
You can't keep hiding
like this forever, right?

1275
02:01:16,830 --> 02:01:20,750
Why not say that chief Oishi
commanded you

1276
02:01:20,830 --> 02:01:23,330
to spread word
of the avengers' exploits?

1277
02:01:23,460 --> 02:01:27,170
So, reluctantly,
you had to leave the others

1278
02:01:27,550 --> 02:01:29,840
Assuming you'd agree to that,

1279
02:01:29,920 --> 02:01:33,010
we came up with these

1280
02:01:33,640 --> 02:01:36,100
I think we'll call them,
"Kichi Buns"

1281
02:01:36,350 --> 02:01:39,980
We made them black and white,
like those Go pieces you so enjoy

1282
02:01:40,060 --> 02:01:44,360
And naturally you can keep
a tenth of the profits

1283
02:01:44,440 --> 02:01:46,610
Not bad, for a couple of bums

1284
02:01:47,480 --> 02:01:49,280
That's enough!

1285
02:01:50,400 --> 02:01:53,530
Revenge... is good for business

1286
02:01:53,660 --> 02:01:54,990
That's right Onobu

1287
02:01:55,070 --> 02:01:58,160
It's important to cash in,
even on misfortune

1288
02:01:58,540 --> 02:01:59,660
That's right!

1289
02:01:59,750 --> 02:02:04,210
Me... It was only at
the chief's command

1290
02:02:04,380 --> 02:02:07,670
that I report the revenge,
that reluctantly, I...

1291
02:02:08,710 --> 02:02:09,710
No, it's true

1292
02:02:09,960 --> 02:02:12,380
I hadn't told anyone,

1293
02:02:12,840 --> 02:02:16,220
but I did not flee in fear,
but for the good of the clan...

1294
02:02:17,560 --> 02:02:21,230
That's right, I've no time to waste

1295
02:02:21,390 --> 02:02:26,310
I must go home to give a full account
to the families of the 46 samurai...

1296
02:02:28,320 --> 02:02:33,070
The flowers bloomed all right,
but they bore some very strange fruit

1297
02:02:33,400 --> 02:02:35,740
Now what about those sweet buns?

1298
02:02:35,820 --> 02:02:36,910
What about them!

1299
02:02:38,080 --> 02:02:41,580
Hey, hear the latest? All 46 samurai
committed hara-kiri!

1300
02:02:41,700 --> 02:02:43,410
Such noble men

1301
02:03:01,470 --> 02:03:02,770
But...

1302
02:03:03,060 --> 02:03:08,230
maybe now, he'll be able
to teach his son to make sandals

1303
02:03:08,770 --> 02:03:10,780
Back at home

1304
02:03:14,650 --> 02:03:18,280
Hey, Shinbo. Come ask Hirano san
to teach you fencing

1305
02:03:20,280 --> 02:03:24,750
After all this, boys won't
need teaching, they'll need swords

1306
02:03:28,130 --> 02:03:31,630
Now, listen up. For samurai,
the moment of death is all

1307
02:03:31,800 --> 02:03:34,470
As they say, “Cherry blossoms are blessed
only when they have all fallen"

1308
02:03:37,260 --> 02:03:41,560
But...
Just as Mago san said,

1309
02:03:42,310 --> 02:03:44,390
cherry blossoms only fall

1310
02:03:46,060 --> 02:03:48,480
to return again next spring

1311
02:03:50,150 --> 02:03:52,820
In even greater beauty

1312
02:03:56,610 --> 02:03:57,780
Say

1313
02:04:01,160 --> 02:04:03,410
Is there a private school around here?
