1
00:01:39,184 --> 00:01:45,068
THE THIRD MURDER

2
00:02:28,483 --> 00:02:29,483
Let me see.

3
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:30,860
Uh?

4
00:02:31,653 --> 00:02:32,994
Take this.

5
00:03:02,226 --> 00:03:05,440
A second charge of homicide
is quite serious.

6
00:03:06,104 --> 00:03:09,901
- But, did he confess?
- Yeah, as soon as he was stopped.

7
00:03:10,442 --> 00:03:13,159
There's no doubt
they'll sentence him to death.

8
00:03:13,362 --> 00:03:16,079
- Sure.
- That's why I need your help.

9
00:03:16,281 --> 00:03:19,745
I wish you have told me before
he was accused.

10
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:23,790
I know. I thought I would be able
to manage this on my own. 

11
00:03:24,164 --> 00:03:27,012
But he changes his story each time
I see him.

12
00:03:38,345 --> 00:03:40,516
Sorry to keep you waiting.

13
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,147
So many today. 

14
00:03:44,643 --> 00:03:46,897
I'm glad it didn't rain.

15
00:03:49,648 --> 00:03:50,648
Listen,

16
00:03:51,191 --> 00:03:54,573
let me introduce you to Mr. Shigemori.
The lawyer I was talking to you about.

17
00:03:55,362 --> 00:03:58,459
Remember the trial from
thirty years ago?

18
00:04:00,075 --> 00:04:01,286
Are you his son?

19
00:04:02,536 --> 00:04:03,877
I'm Shigemori.

20
00:04:05,247 --> 00:04:06,374
And I am Misumi.

21
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:10,806
Your father was very good to me.

22
00:04:12,504 --> 00:04:14,058
The other day I asked you

23
00:04:14,673 --> 00:04:18,304
if there could be any doubt
that you killed him. Is there?


24
00:04:19,094 --> 00:04:20,305
No, there is not.

25
00:04:21,096 --> 00:04:23,267
- You killed him? 
- Yes

26
00:04:23,932 --> 00:04:24,932
I killed him.

27
00:04:26,101 --> 00:04:28,652
Why did you kill him?

28
00:04:29,438 --> 00:04:31,573
He was the owner of the factory
where I worked,

29
00:04:32,065 --> 00:04:33,358
Why?

30
00:04:34,193 --> 00:04:36,411
I needed money to gamble. 

31
00:04:37,905 --> 00:04:40,870
Were you in trouble? With debts?

32
00:04:41,074 --> 00:04:42,074
Yes.

33
00:04:43,118 --> 00:04:46,416
I had asked for money
and couldn't return it.

34
00:04:50,417 --> 00:04:53,715
- When did you stop working?
- September 30th

35
00:04:54,296 --> 00:04:55,719
- Were you fired?
- Yes.

36
00:04:56,006 --> 00:04:57,596
Why were you fired?

37
00:04:58,508 --> 00:05:00,478
I stole money from the safe.

38
00:05:01,637 --> 00:05:05,065
Tell me, 
did you drink any alcohol that day?

39
00:05:05,807 --> 00:05:06,807
Yes.

40
00:05:07,392 --> 00:05:09,777
Three glasses of shouchu.

41
00:05:11,522 --> 00:05:15,033
Maybe you decided to kill him
before starting to drink?

42
00:05:15,817 --> 00:05:19,579
Or were you driven to despair
while you were drinking?

43
00:05:23,075 --> 00:05:25,246
I was in despair while drinking.

44
00:05:25,911 --> 00:05:26,911
How?

45
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:29,502
The last time I asked,

46
00:05:29,748 --> 00:05:33,591
didn't you tell me that you were
thinking about killing him for a time now?

47
00:05:38,632 --> 00:05:40,304
Oh, did I say that?

48
00:05:42,302 --> 00:05:44,770
You hit him from the back
with a wrench. 

49
00:05:45,264 --> 00:05:46,264
Yes.

50
00:05:46,682 --> 00:05:49,861
- Did you confirm he was dead?
- Yes.

51
00:05:50,686 --> 00:05:52,691
He wasn't breathing anymore.

52
00:05:55,274 --> 00:05:56,317
Your hand.

53
00:05:56,692 --> 00:05:58,245
Were you injured?

54
00:05:58,569 --> 00:05:59,569
Yes.

55
00:06:01,071 --> 00:06:02,364
When I burnt his body.

56
00:06:02,573 --> 00:06:04,293
Where did you get the gas from?

57
00:06:04,575 --> 00:06:06,876
I went to the factory storehouse
to get it.

58
00:06:07,369 --> 00:06:08,496
That far?

59
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:11,380
I ran,
it took less than ten minutes.

60
00:06:14,293 --> 00:06:18,006
So, you didn't take the gas
with you from the beginning?

61
00:06:18,505 --> 00:06:19,505
No.

62
00:06:20,966 --> 00:06:21,966
Write it down.

63
00:06:22,968 --> 00:06:25,388
Another thing, I asked you to write

64
00:06:25,554 --> 00:06:28,188
a letter to the victim's family.
Do you remember?

65
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,640
Yes.

66
00:06:31,518 --> 00:06:34,152
I'll take it,
they will give it to me at the exit.

67
00:06:34,813 --> 00:06:35,813
Yes.

68
00:06:47,534 --> 00:06:50,298
Are the prosecution going to ask
for the death penalty?

69
00:06:50,621 --> 00:06:51,878
It's very likely.

70
00:06:52,331 --> 00:06:56,211
It isn't possible to change the accusation
of homicide with premeditated theft.

71
00:06:56,752 --> 00:06:58,923
But we have to try.

72
00:06:59,087 --> 00:07:00,890
We must object to the facts.

73
00:07:01,215 --> 00:07:03,184
If we don't, we will have lost before starting.

74
00:07:07,638 --> 00:07:08,931
Hey, Settsu.

75
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:10,389
Yes?

76
00:07:10,682 --> 00:07:14,645
Is Misumi okay with us opposing
the facts?

77
00:07:15,562 --> 00:07:17,484
Yeah, sure, why?

78
00:07:18,607 --> 00:07:20,529
It didn't seem like it to me.

79
00:07:21,902 --> 00:07:22,946
I'll take life in prison,

80
00:07:23,445 --> 00:07:27,123
no possibility of parole.

81
00:07:28,742 --> 00:07:29,869
Has he got any family?

82
00:07:30,452 --> 00:07:31,923
A daughter, that we know.

83
00:07:32,246 --> 00:07:34,333
- Age?
- Daughter?

84
00:07:34,623 --> 00:07:35,916
She's 36 years old. 

85
00:07:37,584 --> 00:07:40,135
Do you want to see her?
She lives in Rumoi, in Hokkaido.

86
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:42,348
That's very far away.

87
00:07:43,257 --> 00:07:44,514
It's very cold.

88
00:07:44,925 --> 00:07:48,104
I don't think she had any contact
with her father. 

89
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,890
No, he's spent 30 years in jail.

90
00:07:52,474 --> 00:07:55,322
I doubt she can tell us anything
of value.

91
00:07:55,811 --> 00:07:58,908
- It's crab season over there.
- Thanks.

92
00:07:59,731 --> 00:08:03,742
Rumoi is known for its octopus,
not crab.

93
00:08:04,361 --> 00:08:07,078
- Oh, poor octopus.
- Don't underestimate the octopus.

94
00:08:08,323 --> 00:08:10,542
- Like you were from Hokkaido.
- Exactly.

95
00:08:13,704 --> 00:08:16,040
I have got to stop eating meat.

96
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:21,551
We have to take the plane to Asahikawa
and finish the trip on train.

97
00:08:22,212 --> 00:08:24,549
Are we being paid for expenses?

98
00:08:25,132 --> 00:08:26,971
To see a witness?

99
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:29,264
Forget it, didn't say anything.

100
00:08:31,555 --> 00:08:33,109
Then it's not worth it. 

101
00:08:33,682 --> 00:08:36,316
Exactly, it's too cold up there.

102
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,232
- And there's only octopus.
- Yeah.

103
00:08:38,604 --> 00:08:41,736
But, shouldn't we go to 
understand Misumi better?

104
00:08:42,065 --> 00:08:43,619
- Understand him better?
- Yes. 

105
00:08:44,193 --> 00:08:47,123
You don't need to understand
a client in order to defend him.

106
00:08:47,362 --> 00:08:48,362
Really?

107
00:08:48,488 --> 00:08:50,992
Of course, it's not like we're gonna 
be friends.

108
00:09:52,761 --> 00:09:54,232
What does it have to do with the case?

109
00:09:54,763 --> 00:09:55,763
Okay,

110
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:57,890
it's possible.

111
00:10:03,981 --> 00:10:06,531
I have the sensation
that it still smells like gas.

112
00:10:06,984 --> 00:10:07,984
Yes.

113
00:10:15,784 --> 00:10:17,338
Would you call this

114
00:10:20,122 --> 00:10:21,463
a coincidence?

115
00:11:00,787 --> 00:11:02,923
<To Chofu station, please.>

116
00:11:03,415 --> 00:11:06,464
You could tell something was off with him.

117
00:11:07,252 --> 00:11:09,507
He seemed to have burnt hands.

118
00:11:12,341 --> 00:11:13,468
Stop, please.

119
00:11:15,344 --> 00:11:17,230
- Can you rewind a little bit?
- Yes.

120
00:11:19,348 --> 00:11:20,356
Here.

121
00:11:23,852 --> 00:11:24,852
Look,

122
00:11:25,354 --> 00:11:26,825
he opens the window.

123
00:11:27,523 --> 00:11:29,362
- The window?
- Yes.

124
00:11:30,734 --> 00:11:32,371
Did something smell wrong?

125
00:11:34,071 --> 00:11:35,624
I remember now

126
00:11:36,406 --> 00:11:38,328
the gas smell.

127
00:11:39,243 --> 00:11:40,630
Gas...

128
00:11:41,912 --> 00:11:45,839
What did you smell? The wallet, 
the one that came out of his pocket?

129
00:11:47,417 --> 00:11:48,628
Well...

130
00:11:49,753 --> 00:11:51,094
Maybe.

131
00:11:51,713 --> 00:11:52,713
Right?

132
00:11:56,468 --> 00:11:57,468
Okay.

133
00:12:01,056 --> 00:12:02,563
Here.

134
00:12:05,185 --> 00:12:08,282
He has confessed to doing it.
Why do you bother?

135
00:12:08,897 --> 00:12:09,897
Okay, okay.

136
00:12:11,733 --> 00:12:13,703
Don't take it out of the bag.

137
00:12:14,069 --> 00:12:15,069
Sure.

138
00:12:17,573 --> 00:12:18,573
Tell me,

139
00:12:19,074 --> 00:12:20,711
are these gas stains?

140
00:12:21,285 --> 00:12:23,005
- Have you analyzed it?
- Yes.

141
00:12:23,954 --> 00:12:25,710
They confirmed that it was gasoline.

142
00:12:26,456 --> 00:12:28,129
That could mean,

143
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:32,172
that he decided to rob him
after pouring the gas.

144
00:12:33,797 --> 00:12:35,304
Therefore,

145
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:39,512
that would mean that he wasn't thinking
of killing him in order to rob him.

146
00:12:41,555 --> 00:12:44,105
Are you doubting the accusation 
because of a gas stain?

147
00:12:44,641 --> 00:12:46,896
It's proof against the accusation.

148
00:12:53,817 --> 00:12:57,779
At least if he hadn't confessed,
we could defend from a better position.

149
00:12:58,488 --> 00:13:00,707
It's too bad they didn't call us in the beginning.

150
00:13:01,158 --> 00:13:03,957
We'll take the letter,
visit the factory

151
00:13:04,161 --> 00:13:06,545
and comfort the family.

152
00:13:06,663 --> 00:13:09,000
I give a present to the family
in cases such as this.

153
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:10,925
Thank you.

154
00:13:11,501 --> 00:13:12,842
Regarding the motive.

155
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:16,966
Ask his coworkers
if he had something against his boss.

156
00:13:18,175 --> 00:13:19,302
Yes, I'll do that.

157
00:13:21,011 --> 00:13:24,724
Settsu has given us the case,
and now he's washing his hands of it.

158
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,520
Yes.

159
00:13:36,693 --> 00:13:37,737
Hello.

160
00:13:42,366 --> 00:13:44,537
Good day, I'm Shigemori, the lawyer.

161
00:13:45,327 --> 00:13:47,414
I'm defending Misumi Takashi.

162
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:52,212
I'd like to deliver a letter
he wrote to your family.

163
00:13:55,045 --> 00:13:56,718
I'll tell my mother.

164
00:13:58,215 --> 00:13:59,215
Please.

165
00:14:05,514 --> 00:14:06,606
Excuse me. 

166
00:14:29,371 --> 00:14:30,961
My name is Shigemori.

167
00:14:35,377 --> 00:14:38,723
Before anything, I would like
to express my condolences.

168
00:14:52,603 --> 00:14:55,699
Should I forgive him 
just because he sends a letter?

169
00:14:59,401 --> 00:15:00,528
We...

170
00:15:04,239 --> 00:15:06,125
He killed a member of this family.

171
00:15:09,036 --> 00:15:10,626
Then he burned the body.

172
00:15:12,623 --> 00:15:14,544
During the funeral,

173
00:15:17,252 --> 00:15:18,344
we couldn't even

174
00:15:19,588 --> 00:15:21,889
see his face to say goodbye.

175
00:15:22,424 --> 00:15:23,432
Mom...

176
00:15:25,594 --> 00:15:28,607
He's really sorry about
what he did. 

177
00:15:29,723 --> 00:15:31,146
I'm so sorry.

178
00:15:40,108 --> 00:15:41,108
Tell me,

179
00:15:41,527 --> 00:15:44,540
do you think Misumi hated his boss?

180
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,163
More like he was grateful to him
for giving him a job. 

181
00:15:48,575 --> 00:15:49,619
Ok.

182
00:15:50,744 --> 00:15:53,330
Did you watch them arguing about something?

183
00:15:53,664 --> 00:15:54,664
Well,

184
00:15:54,957 --> 00:15:58,504
He always complained to the boss
that he paid so little.

185
00:16:01,588 --> 00:16:04,008
Did you get in trouble again,
Sakurai?

186
00:16:04,174 --> 00:16:05,597
Don't be an idiot.

187
00:16:06,093 --> 00:16:07,896
He's a lawyer, not a cop. 

188
00:16:10,764 --> 00:16:13,232
Did you know Misumi 
spent time in jail?

189
00:16:13,517 --> 00:16:14,517
I knew it.

190
00:16:15,477 --> 00:16:17,198
Many of the people here did time.

191
00:16:17,604 --> 00:16:19,241
Even myself.

192
00:16:20,148 --> 00:16:21,148
Ok.

193
00:16:23,902 --> 00:16:24,902
Do you wanna know?

194
00:16:25,529 --> 00:16:26,529
What I did?

195
00:16:26,989 --> 00:16:27,989
No.

196
00:16:29,157 --> 00:16:30,997
Your boss seemed like a good man.

197
00:16:31,326 --> 00:16:33,462
He hired us because we were cheap.

198
00:16:33,787 --> 00:16:35,839
We were in no position to demand anything.

199
00:16:36,498 --> 00:16:38,005
Ok. I see.

200
00:16:39,334 --> 00:16:41,055
Good. Thanks a lot.

201
00:16:44,631 --> 00:16:45,675
How was it?

202
00:16:48,802 --> 00:16:49,802
Wow,

203
00:16:50,637 --> 00:16:51,978
that bad.

204
00:16:52,347 --> 00:16:53,735
Not that...

205
00:16:54,182 --> 00:16:55,689
That's how things are now.

206
00:16:56,018 --> 00:16:58,735
Victims think they can
get away with anything.

207
00:17:01,648 --> 00:17:03,985
I wonder, why defend him?

208
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:06,366
But that's our job.

209
00:17:09,323 --> 00:17:11,577
Okay, which strategy should we follow?

210
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:17,418
First, we reject the premise that he killed
with the intention of robbing.

211
00:17:18,081 --> 00:17:21,712
We go from homicide with intentional robbery
to plain homicide.

212
00:17:23,212 --> 00:17:25,181
He didn't kill him with the intention of 
robbing him.

213
00:17:25,464 --> 00:17:28,810
He burnt him after killing him,
and then thought about robbing him.

214
00:17:29,509 --> 00:17:31,811
In reality, after he killed him,

215
00:17:32,137 --> 00:17:35,186
he went back to the factory
to get some gas.

216
00:17:35,641 --> 00:17:37,527
- He came back to the factory?
- He came back.

217
00:17:37,643 --> 00:17:39,363
The logical thing would be to run away.

218
00:17:40,604 --> 00:17:42,739
So what's the motive for the crime?

219
00:17:43,524 --> 00:17:45,030
Revenge, it seems would be best.

220
00:17:45,692 --> 00:17:47,863
They often argued about salary.

221
00:17:48,237 --> 00:17:52,329
I don't know all the details,
but that will be our strategy to defend.

222
00:17:53,033 --> 00:17:55,121
He got enraged because he got fired.

223
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:59,632
You're betting on revenge?
That's not much of a defense.

224
00:18:00,457 --> 00:18:03,589
Is it less serious to kill for
revenge than stealing money?

225
00:18:04,044 --> 00:18:06,429
It's always worse to kill for money.

226
00:18:06,838 --> 00:18:09,519
It's considered a crime of selfishness.

227
00:18:09,925 --> 00:18:13,389
- For the kind of killing?
- Good question.

228
00:18:13,845 --> 00:18:15,317
If it was out of revenge,

229
00:18:15,472 --> 00:18:18,355
we need to know how that revenge came to be.

230
00:18:19,226 --> 00:18:21,611
If that's enough to lower the sentence,

231
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,616
it seems to me
that the law is really strange.

232
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:44,626
Shigemori speaking.

233
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,420
Yes.

234
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,388
I'm her father.

235
00:18:52,885 --> 00:18:53,885
How?

236
00:19:01,727 --> 00:19:02,727
Hello.

237
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:07,411
- You called me.
- Are you her father?

238
00:19:09,443 --> 00:19:10,949
Just "hello"?

239
00:19:11,278 --> 00:19:12,286
Normally,

240
00:19:12,613 --> 00:19:15,875
we would've called the police
immediately 

241
00:19:18,118 --> 00:19:20,040
I'm deeply sorry about all the hassle

242
00:19:21,622 --> 00:19:23,259
my daughter has caused here.

243
00:19:32,633 --> 00:19:34,020
You're a lawyer.

244
00:19:36,136 --> 00:19:39,814
I'm in the middle of
an important homicide case

245
00:19:40,766 --> 00:19:42,985
and I'm spending a lot of time outside home.

246
00:19:44,937 --> 00:19:47,024
I'm sure this happened because of that.

247
00:19:49,483 --> 00:19:50,483
Yuka,

248
00:19:51,235 --> 00:19:52,235
I'm sorry.

249
00:19:52,694 --> 00:19:54,450
I haven't been taking care of you.

250
00:20:03,622 --> 00:20:05,627
Why haven't you called your mother?

251
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,127
In a case like this,

252
00:20:08,669 --> 00:20:10,638
a lawyer is more useful.

253
00:20:14,383 --> 00:20:15,973
I'm very grateful.

254
00:20:19,388 --> 00:20:20,776
Well, let's see,

255
00:20:21,306 --> 00:20:22,896
Tell me about Nemo.

256
00:20:25,644 --> 00:20:27,281
He's history now.

257
00:20:28,188 --> 00:20:29,529
Do you want the fish tank?

258
00:20:30,524 --> 00:20:31,616
Are you okay with it?

259
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:33,782
No, I didn't mean it like that.

260
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:35,912
They died.

261
00:20:36,989 --> 00:20:37,989
Dead?

262
00:20:38,615 --> 00:20:40,169
- All of them? 
- Yes.

263
00:20:42,828 --> 00:20:44,465
Why are you sad?

264
00:20:45,122 --> 00:20:46,463
They were just fish.

265
00:20:49,543 --> 00:20:51,797
You didn't flush them down the toilet, right?

266
00:20:54,006 --> 00:20:57,304
They were living beings,
and had to be properly buried,

267
00:20:58,135 --> 00:20:59,476
with respect.

268
00:20:59,845 --> 00:21:00,845
Oh...

269
00:21:01,722 --> 00:21:04,190
All of a sudden,
you sound like a real father.

270
00:21:04,683 --> 00:21:06,439
What do you mean I sound?

271
00:21:07,477 --> 00:21:09,814
- I am your father.
- At this moment?

272
00:21:22,576 --> 00:21:23,576
Yuka,

273
00:21:25,412 --> 00:21:28,093
Tell me, why did you cry before?

274
00:21:30,959 --> 00:21:32,549
I can cry on command very well.

275
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,899
Look, check it out.

276
00:21:52,272 --> 00:21:53,399
Isn't it cool?

277
00:21:53,899 --> 00:21:55,453
Everyone falls for it.

278
00:22:05,702 --> 00:22:07,624
Go ahead, pick it up.

279
00:22:08,705 --> 00:22:09,749
Not now.

280
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:12,382
Pick it up.

281
00:22:13,252 --> 00:22:15,755
- Is that your lover?
- Don't speak nonsense.

282
00:22:16,713 --> 00:22:17,887
It's Settsu.

283
00:22:21,426 --> 00:22:22,426
Yes.

284
00:22:25,347 --> 00:22:26,347
Right now?

285
00:22:27,683 --> 00:22:28,683
Yes, I can.

286
00:22:29,601 --> 00:22:30,989
No, not yet.

287
00:22:37,317 --> 00:22:39,073
Has Misumi read this?

288
00:22:41,572 --> 00:22:43,956
I'll send it for him to read.

289
00:22:45,325 --> 00:22:49,122
He can't keep saying the first thing
that pops in his mind.

290
00:22:53,792 --> 00:22:55,299
Sorry for the delay.

291
00:22:57,129 --> 00:22:58,968
It's cold today, isn't it?

292
00:23:02,342 --> 00:23:03,342
Let's see.

293
00:23:04,094 --> 00:23:05,094
Today...

294
00:23:07,139 --> 00:23:09,523
we're here because of this piece.

295
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:12,818
Ok.

296
00:23:14,354 --> 00:23:17,368
Is what you state in this interview 
completely true?

297
00:23:18,609 --> 00:23:20,530
Especially the part where it says

298
00:23:20,652 --> 00:23:23,500
that his woman asked you to do it
so she could cash in on the insurance.

299
00:23:25,991 --> 00:23:26,991
Yes.

300
00:23:28,493 --> 00:23:30,166
Did you really say this?

301
00:23:32,664 --> 00:23:34,504
Yes, probably.

302
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:38,215
What exactly do you mean with
"probably"?

303
00:23:39,838 --> 00:23:40,965
Mr. Misumi,

304
00:23:41,882 --> 00:23:45,725
there's a record of money transfer
into your bank account

305
00:23:46,595 --> 00:23:49,443
of 500,000 yen at the beginning of October.

306
00:23:50,015 --> 00:23:51,854
Beyond your regular salary.

307
00:23:52,643 --> 00:23:53,734
Was it his woman?

308
00:23:55,187 --> 00:23:57,488
Yes, a transfer from his woman.

309
00:23:59,691 --> 00:24:01,115
So, 

310
00:24:02,027 --> 00:24:04,791
this was an advance payment for 
what you had to do?

311
00:24:06,198 --> 00:24:07,198
Yes.

312
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:12,248
Why didn't you tell us from moment one?

313
00:24:14,873 --> 00:24:16,759
I honestly don't know.

314
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,221
Maybe because...

315
00:24:24,216 --> 00:24:27,016
the journalist asked you first

316
00:24:27,177 --> 00:24:28,767
and it was an exclusive interview?

317
00:24:32,057 --> 00:24:33,611
I don't recall.

318
00:24:34,601 --> 00:24:36,108
Here we go again.

319
00:24:37,229 --> 00:24:39,732
How did she ask you to kill her husband?

320
00:24:40,232 --> 00:24:42,486
In an email from her mobile phone.

321
00:24:42,651 --> 00:24:44,786
- An email?
- Yes.

322
00:24:44,903 --> 00:24:45,995
When?

323
00:24:47,072 --> 00:24:49,623
Two weeks before I killed him.

324
00:24:50,617 --> 00:24:52,089
Do you still have it?

325
00:24:52,744 --> 00:24:54,251
It's very likely.

326
00:24:57,624 --> 00:25:01,302
This can work.  
Conspiracy, instigation and complicity.

327
00:25:01,461 --> 00:25:03,134
- You think so?
- Yeah.

328
00:25:06,091 --> 00:25:09,270
After the crime,
did you contact the wife?

329
00:25:09,928 --> 00:25:12,811
Yes, I called her
from a phone booth.

330
00:25:13,265 --> 00:25:14,522
And then?...

331
00:25:17,477 --> 00:25:19,317
She told me that if I didn't 
involve her in this,

332
00:25:20,439 --> 00:25:22,029
she would take care of me.

333
00:25:28,113 --> 00:25:31,043
And tell me, did you and the wife

334
00:25:32,784 --> 00:25:34,671
have something to do with each other

335
00:25:35,412 --> 00:25:36,883
as man and woman?

336
00:25:43,128 --> 00:25:46,841
<i><font color="#ffff00">According to the article
there is some unexpected news</i></font>

337
00:25:47,007 --> 00:25:49,890
<i><font color="#ffff00">about the killing
of the factory owner</i></font>

338
00:25:50,969 --> 00:25:54,066
"Can you handle the deal
 for 500,000 yen?"

339
00:25:54,514 --> 00:25:55,558
"When?"

340
00:25:55,974 --> 00:25:59,023
"I must return the money
 by the end of October".

341
00:25:59,144 --> 00:26:01,648
"Understood. I'll handle everything".

342
00:26:06,318 --> 00:26:09,699
- What do you think, do you have a bad feeling?
- No.

343
00:26:10,322 --> 00:26:13,039
If we show she paid that money to Misumi.

344
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,371
It's a criminal conspiracy.

345
00:26:15,994 --> 00:26:18,759
She would become a guilty party.

346
00:26:18,997 --> 00:26:22,710
But if they had a sexual relationship,
like it seems they did according to Misumi,

347
00:26:23,001 --> 00:26:25,137
then they'd be co-conspirators.

348
00:26:25,254 --> 00:26:26,547
But, did he acknowlege it?

349
00:26:26,672 --> 00:26:28,428
He was really uncomfortable.

350
00:26:28,882 --> 00:26:30,804
By his expression, I'd say yes.

351
00:26:32,678 --> 00:26:35,395
But he didn't openly acknowlege it.

352
00:26:35,556 --> 00:26:37,726
I'm sure they were sleeping around.

353
00:26:37,975 --> 00:26:41,356
I could sense it as soon as I saw
that woman's face.

354
00:26:42,312 --> 00:26:45,326
But in no moment does he say:
"She asked me to kill him."

355
00:26:47,025 --> 00:26:48,025
Let me see.

356
00:26:48,402 --> 00:26:49,445
- Give it to me.
- Yes.

357
00:26:49,862 --> 00:26:52,709
I doubt the prosecutor will reduce the 
sentence because of this email.

358
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:56,954
They've decided he's guilty,
there's no turning back.

359
00:26:57,744 --> 00:26:59,999
I know what I'm talking about, 
I was a prosecutor once.

360
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:01,796
Yes, but, and this?

361
00:27:01,957 --> 00:27:06,513
"She said that if I didn't involve her
in this, she'll take care of me".

362
00:27:06,628 --> 00:27:07,628
Here it is.

363
00:27:07,963 --> 00:27:09,386
Yeah, but

364
00:27:09,965 --> 00:27:13,014
she could be referring to their sexual 
relationship, not the killing.

365
00:27:15,804 --> 00:27:17,690
What's the motive?

366
00:27:17,973 --> 00:27:19,859
Revenge or life insurance?

367
00:27:20,893 --> 00:27:24,819
Whatever works best for the client,
clearly.

368
00:27:25,314 --> 00:27:28,197
Yes, of course, as a legal strategy.

369
00:27:28,317 --> 00:27:30,404
What else should we consider?

370
00:27:30,819 --> 00:27:32,705
- Nothing, I guess.
- Exactly.

371
00:27:33,071 --> 00:27:35,871
We'll never find out 
what the truth is.

372
00:27:36,408 --> 00:27:39,256
That's why we lean to the 
more beneficial motive.

373
00:27:40,329 --> 00:27:41,752
Okay, so what'll we do?

374
00:27:44,041 --> 00:27:45,547
Follow it and risk it?

375
00:27:46,668 --> 00:27:49,883
We have to look for mitigating causes.
It's a jury trial.

376
00:27:50,255 --> 00:27:54,312
Personally, I'd doubt 
before asking for the death penalty.

377
00:27:57,554 --> 00:28:00,140
The defense is asking that some emails

378
00:28:00,307 --> 00:28:01,897
be admitted as evidence.

379
00:28:03,602 --> 00:28:04,610
Objection.

380
00:28:05,896 --> 00:28:08,909
Very well.
Why?
And to what is this objection?

381
00:28:09,733 --> 00:28:13,115
Do you consider that the emails
are not reliable?

382
00:28:13,445 --> 00:28:16,126
No, because they are irrelevant.

383
00:28:16,698 --> 00:28:17,707
How?

384
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,955
These are objective evidence.

385
00:28:21,453 --> 00:28:24,087
Objection overruled in this case.

386
00:28:25,415 --> 00:28:26,673
Okay...

387
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:30,509
Okay, fine.

388
00:28:31,463 --> 00:28:32,590
Admitted.

389
00:28:33,048 --> 00:28:35,682
The defense is not denying culpability,
correct?

390
00:28:35,884 --> 00:28:38,269
No, we don't deny it.

391
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,686
Is this in regards to 
an intention of robbery?

392
00:28:42,224 --> 00:28:45,439
Yes, we oppose the accusation
of premeditated robbery.

393
00:28:46,895 --> 00:28:47,895
Let's see.

394
00:28:48,397 --> 00:28:50,817
I see that the prosecutor will call

395
00:28:51,733 --> 00:28:54,699
wife Mizue and daughter Sakie as witnesses.

396
00:28:55,737 --> 00:28:56,737
That's right.

397
00:28:57,030 --> 00:29:00,163
- What does the defense say?
- You decide, Chief Justice.

398
00:29:01,034 --> 00:29:03,336
Will the defense call some witness?

399
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:05,079
Yes.

400
00:29:05,414 --> 00:29:08,795
The defense will also call
to testify, Mizue, the wife.

401
00:29:09,751 --> 00:29:12,337
To rebuke the accusation
of premeditated robbery.

402
00:29:12,629 --> 00:29:13,629
That's right.

403
00:29:14,256 --> 00:29:17,969
We will also call Megumi, 
the accused daughter.

404
00:29:19,428 --> 00:29:20,851
Yes, that's our intention.

405
00:29:21,638 --> 00:29:23,275
What say the prosecutor?

406
00:29:26,268 --> 00:29:27,739
As you wish, Chief Justice.

407
00:29:28,437 --> 00:29:29,860
Okay. In that case,

408
00:29:30,606 --> 00:29:32,408
The visit will be celebrated...

409
00:29:37,946 --> 00:29:40,627
I doubt that an email can demonstrate

410
00:29:40,741 --> 00:29:42,294
that she asked him to kill her husband.

411
00:29:43,327 --> 00:29:46,292
It will do to knock down the charge
of premeditated robbery.

412
00:29:46,663 --> 00:29:50,175
I think he panicked
and decided to blame someone else.

413
00:29:50,959 --> 00:29:55,016
You seem to be convinced 
this is a robbery/homicide.

414
00:29:55,172 --> 00:29:57,509
You're only concerned about reducing
time.

415
00:29:57,674 --> 00:29:59,477
That's what lawyers do.

416
00:30:02,846 --> 00:30:04,685
Lawyers like you stop criminals

417
00:30:05,682 --> 00:30:08,530
from confronting their blame.

418
00:30:09,853 --> 00:30:10,853
How?

419
00:30:11,522 --> 00:30:14,903
What exactly does it mean
"confront their blame"?

420
00:30:16,318 --> 00:30:19,082
It means not to look away 
from the truth.

421
00:30:19,988 --> 00:30:21,115
The truth?

422
00:30:26,328 --> 00:30:27,751
Okay, I think that's enough.

423
00:30:27,996 --> 00:30:31,093
We're clearly on opposite sides.

424
00:30:31,792 --> 00:30:32,792
Aren't we?

425
00:30:34,836 --> 00:30:35,880
Good day.

426
00:30:36,046 --> 00:30:38,217
- I have kept you waiting
- It's okay.

427
00:30:38,382 --> 00:30:40,802
This house doesn't follow the norms.

428
00:30:41,176 --> 00:30:43,561
They didn't respect the minimum distance.

429
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:47,184
That one over there is now on his second wife,
24 years younger than him.

430
00:30:47,516 --> 00:30:49,521
Wow, I almost envy him.

431
00:30:49,893 --> 00:30:52,942
But at night it's hell,
they're so noisy.

432
00:30:54,857 --> 00:30:56,577
- Go ahead.
- Thank you.

433
00:31:03,866 --> 00:31:05,752
How did Mr. Misumi behave?

434
00:31:05,868 --> 00:31:09,249
He was respectful of the norms.
Took the garbage on time.

435
00:31:09,413 --> 00:31:12,426
By the way, he asked me 
to send some jerseys.

436
00:31:12,583 --> 00:31:14,919
Did he get them? 
There was a green one.

437
00:31:15,377 --> 00:31:18,924
- Yeah, he was wearing it.
- It must be cold in jail.

438
00:31:19,548 --> 00:31:22,229
Although no different to this.

439
00:31:25,178 --> 00:31:28,275
It smells wet in winter.
There's no ventilation.

440
00:31:33,395 --> 00:31:34,395
Tell me...

441
00:31:36,732 --> 00:31:39,449
Do you remember if some time,
this woman came to see him?

442
00:31:40,736 --> 00:31:43,286
Well, I've seen her on TV, that's it.

443
00:31:43,906 --> 00:31:46,160
But I've never seen her around here.

444
00:31:46,658 --> 00:31:48,710
She might've tried to go unnoticed.

445
00:31:49,745 --> 00:31:52,509
Honestly, very few people came
to see him.

446
00:31:52,915 --> 00:31:55,085
A young girl came a couple of times.

447
00:31:55,417 --> 00:31:57,256
- A young girl?
- Yes.

448
00:31:58,253 --> 00:31:59,297
What age?

449
00:31:59,588 --> 00:32:02,969
An adolescent.
Had a uniform and couldn't walk well.

450
00:32:03,091 --> 00:32:04,847
Walked like this, look.

451
00:32:10,265 --> 00:32:11,737
How did she behave?

452
00:32:13,477 --> 00:32:16,526
Laughed a lot.
Talked with a happy voice.

453
00:32:19,274 --> 00:32:20,995
But, wasn't she his daughter?

454
00:32:24,029 --> 00:32:25,536
It might have been.

455
00:32:26,949 --> 00:32:29,036
Oh my, there's a spider.

456
00:32:30,786 --> 00:32:32,423
That means no bad luck for the day.

457
00:32:40,295 --> 00:32:43,724
I just remembered,
that when his bird died,

458
00:32:43,882 --> 00:32:46,765
he asked me if I would mind 
burying it outside.

459
00:33:27,676 --> 00:33:30,061
I appreciate you bringing me a gift.

460
00:33:32,014 --> 00:33:35,395
I thought you'd like peanut butter.

461
00:33:36,435 --> 00:33:38,072
I saw a jar in your house.

462
00:33:38,896 --> 00:33:40,023
I love it.

463
00:33:40,856 --> 00:33:43,537
Twice a week we get bread
with our food.

464
00:33:47,446 --> 00:33:48,446
Did you have...

465
00:33:49,281 --> 00:33:50,373
a bird?

466
00:33:52,284 --> 00:33:53,284
Yes.

467
00:33:54,578 --> 00:33:55,752
A canary.

468
00:33:57,623 --> 00:33:58,797
But he died,

469
00:33:59,416 --> 00:34:00,627
of sickness.

470
00:34:03,754 --> 00:34:04,928
The grave...

471
00:34:06,715 --> 00:34:08,222
- The grave?
- Yes.

472
00:34:09,051 --> 00:34:10,723
Under the window.

473
00:34:11,637 --> 00:34:12,637
Okay.

474
00:34:14,223 --> 00:34:17,022
I was surprised to see
the cage was so big.

475
00:34:18,727 --> 00:34:20,530
I dug up the grave.

476
00:34:24,358 --> 00:34:28,035
Five birds don't become ill
all of a sudden.

477
00:34:28,904 --> 00:34:30,114
Well,

478
00:34:32,658 --> 00:34:35,422
I could've set them free,

479
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:39,166
but they wouldn't have made it on 
their own.

480
00:34:51,385 --> 00:34:52,559
One of them,

481
00:34:55,597 --> 00:34:57,234
managed to escape.

482
00:35:01,103 --> 00:35:03,155
The cold will last for a couple of 
weeks.

483
00:35:04,731 --> 00:35:06,368
I wonder how he is managing,

484
00:35:07,693 --> 00:35:09,116
to eat and find shelter.

485
00:35:12,865 --> 00:35:13,865
Can I know,

486
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,834
how much you paid for rent?

487
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:20,008
38,000 yen.

488
00:35:20,914 --> 00:35:23,382
It's small, but has a full bath.

489
00:35:26,628 --> 00:35:28,515
I talked with the landlady.

490
00:35:30,632 --> 00:35:32,222
You made the payment

491
00:35:33,468 --> 00:35:36,233
for the next month, 
ten days before the usual date.

492
00:35:39,141 --> 00:35:40,185
I think...

493
00:35:42,311 --> 00:35:45,324
you were planning to be arrested,
weren't you?

494
00:35:50,444 --> 00:35:53,457
You don't understand. 
Mr. Shigemori, right?

495
00:35:54,448 --> 00:35:55,448
What?

496
00:35:55,908 --> 00:35:57,331
Paying the rent,

497
00:35:58,327 --> 00:35:59,620
is a pleasure.

498
00:36:01,997 --> 00:36:03,504
- A pleasure?
- Yes.

499
00:36:06,293 --> 00:36:09,176
You don't pay rent in jail.

500
00:36:11,924 --> 00:36:14,178
That was the reason for doing it.

501
00:36:22,976 --> 00:36:24,020
Mr. Shigemori,

502
00:36:25,145 --> 00:36:26,699
show me your hand

503
00:36:27,648 --> 00:36:29,035
- My hand?
- Yeah.

504
00:36:31,151 --> 00:36:32,151
Like that.

505
00:36:43,497 --> 00:36:45,253
You have a big hand.

506
00:36:45,415 --> 00:36:47,171
No, keep it there.

507
00:37:00,055 --> 00:37:01,396
In a while,

508
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,731
you'll notice the heat.

509
00:37:07,813 --> 00:37:08,813
You see, I...

510
00:37:10,357 --> 00:37:12,279
You learn more about a person

511
00:37:12,985 --> 00:37:15,369
like this than talking to them.

512
00:37:19,324 --> 00:37:20,831
Can I try to...

513
00:37:21,994 --> 00:37:24,081
guess what you're thinking?

514
00:37:28,542 --> 00:37:29,716
Go ahead.

515
00:38:11,668 --> 00:38:13,389
How old is she?

516
00:38:14,463 --> 00:38:15,463
Your daughter.

517
00:38:19,343 --> 00:38:20,343
She's

518
00:38:21,261 --> 00:38:22,261
14 years old.

519
00:38:25,182 --> 00:38:26,689
Sure, I see.

520
00:38:39,321 --> 00:38:42,749
The next person to testify will 
be Misumi's daughter.

521
00:38:43,951 --> 00:38:46,916
Well, if we're able to find her.

522
00:38:48,288 --> 00:38:50,969
Then we'll interrogate
Misumi himself.

523
00:38:51,166 --> 00:38:53,385
That will be the hard part. 

524
00:38:53,835 --> 00:38:58,058
Following the theory that the widow
is the real main guilty party.

525
00:38:58,715 --> 00:39:00,767
Yeah, that's it.

526
00:39:03,262 --> 00:39:05,765
I don't understand you,
you don't seem to be sure.

527
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:12,029
I can't sell the flat
for the amount I was expecting.

528
00:39:12,271 --> 00:39:13,694
That's why you're like this?

529
00:39:14,857 --> 00:39:16,992
I beg you, Shigemori,

530
00:39:17,234 --> 00:39:20,497
Misumi's life depends on 
"you know what".

531
00:39:21,071 --> 00:39:22,792
What's "you know what"?

532
00:39:22,906 --> 00:39:24,413
You know what.

533
00:39:24,741 --> 00:39:26,129
Let's leave it.

534
00:39:29,413 --> 00:39:31,169
- Hey, Settsu.
- Yes?

535
00:39:32,374 --> 00:39:35,553
Did you tell Misumi many things
about me?

536
00:39:36,753 --> 00:39:38,344
What did I tell him?

537
00:39:38,881 --> 00:39:41,301
We practiced in the same firm.

538
00:39:42,426 --> 00:39:44,016
Did you talk to him about my daughter?

539
00:39:44,469 --> 00:39:46,309
I didn't tell him you had one.

540
00:39:47,347 --> 00:39:48,347
Why?

541
00:39:49,391 --> 00:39:50,391
What did he say?

542
00:39:52,269 --> 00:39:54,654
Nothing, don't worry.

543
00:40:51,578 --> 00:40:55,007
HOKKAIDO UNIVERSITY
VETERINARY FACULTY

544
00:41:20,482 --> 00:41:22,570
It seems she limps from birth.

545
00:41:23,861 --> 00:41:24,861
But...

546
00:41:25,863 --> 00:41:26,863
But?

547
00:41:28,115 --> 00:41:29,787
It's rumored that she did it to herself,

548
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:32,833
when she jumped off the roof
of the factory as a child.

549
00:41:36,123 --> 00:41:37,629
Why does she lie?

550
00:41:39,084 --> 00:41:40,472
I'd like to know.

551
00:41:42,629 --> 00:41:44,717
Where was Sakie the day of the crime?

552
00:41:46,842 --> 00:41:50,638
She came back home after school 
and didn't go out again.

553
00:41:51,388 --> 00:41:53,773
She has difficulties walking.

554
00:42:04,443 --> 00:42:08,323
Believe me, prosecution and defense
often differ completely

555
00:42:08,488 --> 00:42:10,992
when it comes to
psychiatric evaluations.

556
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:14,204
Psychiatry isn't a science.

557
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:16,091
It's pure fiction.

558
00:42:17,289 --> 00:42:19,792
You enjoy messing with the evaluations.

559
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,423
Here you are.

560
00:42:23,837 --> 00:42:27,847
This is the file I promised
Rumoi's case, homicide and robbery.

561
00:42:29,635 --> 00:42:32,767
I was surprised at your call.
Wasn't expecting it.

562
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,439
I present to you, Judge Shigemori,
now retired.

563
00:42:38,727 --> 00:42:39,735
Your father.

564
00:42:40,729 --> 00:42:43,529
Thank you very much, sir,
this will come in as very helpful.

565
00:42:43,857 --> 00:42:47,914
You shouldn't have bothered bringing it here. 
You could've sent it via messenger.

566
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:50,406
- Which promotion are you?
- Number 69.

567
00:42:50,572 --> 00:42:52,458
It must be hard, 
because of the competition.

568
00:42:52,658 --> 00:42:54,497
Your son has me entertained.

569
00:42:54,743 --> 00:42:56,997
- Do you always work here? 
- Almost always.

570
00:42:57,162 --> 00:42:59,001
Your father told me you wanted to be

571
00:42:59,164 --> 00:43:01,632
a judge when you were little.

572
00:43:01,833 --> 00:43:03,221
Really?

573
00:43:04,002 --> 00:43:05,046
I didn't think so.

574
00:43:05,212 --> 00:43:08,640
Would you mind not talking about
my childhood?

575
00:43:10,175 --> 00:43:12,227
- What's up with her?
- What?

576
00:43:12,386 --> 00:43:14,806
Divorced women are very patient.

577
00:43:15,347 --> 00:43:18,444
I'm not legally divorced.

578
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:20,903
Then, I'll offer as a candidate.

579
00:43:22,229 --> 00:43:25,610
Ok, do me a favor and go home
as soon as you finish your tea.

580
00:43:25,774 --> 00:43:28,574
No, I intend to stay for a few nights.

581
00:43:28,735 --> 00:43:29,448
What?

582
00:43:29,611 --> 00:43:33,622
Do you know the Italian restaurant
La Bisboccia. In Hiro-o?

583
00:43:33,782 --> 00:43:35,040
I don't.

584
00:43:35,826 --> 00:43:38,412
So, where will you sleep tonight?

585
00:43:38,996 --> 00:43:41,083
Do you want me to reserve a room?

586
00:43:41,915 --> 00:43:43,671
A suite for two, please.

587
00:43:46,461 --> 00:43:48,431
You're so funny, sir.

588
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:04,481
His own intention was to kill someone.

589
00:44:05,981 --> 00:44:07,369
Was it the only motive?

590
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:08,900
Exactly.

591
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:12,363
Killing for fun and then burning the body.

592
00:44:13,238 --> 00:44:16,667
Some people resemble beasts more than
they do humans.

593
00:44:17,784 --> 00:44:18,784
However,

594
00:44:19,077 --> 00:44:20,880
when the sentence was declared,

595
00:44:21,246 --> 00:44:23,298
you used his conflicted childhood,

596
00:44:23,624 --> 00:44:27,171
his poverty,
as mitigating circumstances.

597
00:44:27,961 --> 00:44:29,349
That was thirty years ago.

598
00:44:30,631 --> 00:44:34,308
We still believed that social condition 
was an influencing factor.

599
00:44:35,677 --> 00:44:38,607
In other words, you blame a time?

600
00:44:39,848 --> 00:44:41,438
I have never been in favor

601
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:43,820
of abolishing the death penalty.

602
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:46,313
Now, 

603
00:44:47,439 --> 00:44:50,536
because of a too lenient sentence,

604
00:44:51,818 --> 00:44:54,287
another person had to die.

605
00:44:56,823 --> 00:44:58,544
And it weighs heavy on me.

606
00:45:01,662 --> 00:45:02,662
Listen.

607
00:45:03,956 --> 00:45:05,462
An abyss

608
00:45:05,916 --> 00:45:09,131
sets apart killers from the rest
of humans.

609
00:45:10,712 --> 00:45:14,675
To cross that abyss is a matter
determined at birth.

610
00:45:18,303 --> 00:45:21,317
I think that's a very arrogant statement.

611
00:45:22,683 --> 00:45:25,815
Don't you even believe
in possible rehabilitation?

612
00:45:26,687 --> 00:45:28,608
Remember he sent you a postcard.

613
00:45:28,981 --> 00:45:30,867
You are the arrogant one

614
00:45:31,024 --> 00:45:33,326
to think one can change so easily.

615
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:35,530
This time

616
00:45:36,697 --> 00:45:38,583
he killed for money, right?

617
00:45:40,492 --> 00:45:41,492
No.

618
00:45:42,494 --> 00:45:46,207
Something tells me the motive
had nothing to do with money.

619
00:45:48,333 --> 00:45:51,466
Don't waste your time on that.

620
00:45:53,213 --> 00:45:55,432
No, don't say it's wasted time.

621
00:45:58,385 --> 00:46:01,932
If we can't even understand family,
imagine a stranger.

00:48:29,578 --> 00:48:33,006
How old were you when it
went to trial the first time?

639
00:48:33,790 --> 00:48:34,834
In the eighties?

640
00:48:34,958 --> 00:48:36,512
86.

641
00:48:37,336 --> 00:48:39,720
I must've been about a 2nd year 
high school student I'd guess.

642
00:48:42,341 --> 00:48:43,468
Do you remember?

643
00:48:43,675 --> 00:48:44,675
No.

644
00:48:45,677 --> 00:48:47,765
Hokkaido is a big prefecture.

645
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:52,190
Who can remember a killing in this 
tiny town?

646
00:48:54,853 --> 00:48:56,609
He killed two loan sharks.

647
00:48:56,897 --> 00:48:59,151
Stole their money and burnt the floor.

648
00:48:59,525 --> 00:49:01,861
It's amazing he didn't get
the death penalty.

649
00:49:02,402 --> 00:49:04,289
If he had,

650
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:06,951
he wouldn't have killed again.

651
00:49:07,533 --> 00:49:09,454
Your father wouldn't like that.

652
00:49:10,869 --> 00:49:13,337
Those were his exact words.

653
00:49:23,549 --> 00:49:25,020
I stopped him, let's see,

654
00:49:25,175 --> 00:49:28,687
January 22nd, 1986.

655
00:49:30,264 --> 00:49:33,194
The train wasn't running
because of the storm.

656
00:49:33,892 --> 00:49:35,980
A hell of a cold night, that night.

657
00:49:37,938 --> 00:49:41,117
Did you stop Misumi personally
Mr. Watanabe?

658
00:49:41,525 --> 00:49:42,525
Yes.

659
00:49:44,194 --> 00:49:46,282
The day after the incident,

660
00:49:47,072 --> 00:49:49,409
I found him sitting on the beach,

661
00:49:50,242 --> 00:49:52,164
in front of the station.

662
00:49:53,745 --> 00:49:56,510
What was the motive of the homicide?

663
00:49:58,292 --> 00:50:01,638
Well, officially, it was revenge.

664
00:50:02,629 --> 00:50:03,840
Officially?

665
00:50:04,715 --> 00:50:07,218
To tell you the truth, nobody knows.

666
00:50:08,135 --> 00:50:11,682
He contradicted himself several 
times during the interrogation.

667
00:50:14,433 --> 00:50:17,861
After the coal mines were closed, 
around that time,

668
00:50:18,103 --> 00:50:20,155
many people were left out of work.

669
00:50:22,232 --> 00:50:25,993
Yakuza gangsters offered them loans
with very high interest.

670
00:50:27,404 --> 00:50:29,789
Treated them really bad.

671
00:50:30,949 --> 00:50:33,286
Thanks, no tea for us.

672
00:50:36,246 --> 00:50:38,547
I imagine that his lawyer thought

673
00:50:39,249 --> 00:50:41,254
revenge would be a mitigating factor.

674
00:50:43,212 --> 00:50:45,762
That he would avoid the death sentence
like that.

675
00:50:47,341 --> 00:50:50,852
Didn't he feel anger towards someone
or have any enemies?

676
00:50:51,637 --> 00:50:53,724
Takashi wasn't resentful,

677
00:50:54,223 --> 00:50:56,228
and he didn't hate anyone.

678
00:50:57,434 --> 00:50:59,688
That was the unnerving part of him.

679
00:51:01,313 --> 00:51:02,524
A little like

680
00:51:03,398 --> 00:51:05,866
he was an empty pot.

681
00:51:13,325 --> 00:51:15,579
- Be careful. A car's coming.
- Ok.

682
00:51:20,499 --> 00:51:22,052
World one tower.

683
00:51:22,501 --> 00:51:25,087
Ran, Hitomi, Asuka.

684
00:51:27,631 --> 00:51:28,758
Isn't it there?

685
00:51:29,258 --> 00:51:30,432
Yeah, it's there.

686
00:51:40,018 --> 00:51:43,400
Do you know if your father made
contact with her?

687
00:51:43,981 --> 00:51:45,534
Sent her any money?

688
00:51:46,275 --> 00:51:47,275
Yukari.

689
00:51:48,068 --> 00:51:50,536
Megumi talked about her father 
sometime?

690
00:51:51,029 --> 00:51:53,248
I know the men she called "dad".

691
00:51:53,490 --> 00:51:56,504
Not that, idiot.
I mean her real father.

692
00:51:56,702 --> 00:51:58,707
Good evening everyone!

693
00:51:59,037 --> 00:52:01,755
- How long were you there?
- Until five am.

694
00:52:01,874 --> 00:52:04,757
- You have a swollen face.
- Shut up, I was at the karaoke.

695
00:52:04,877 --> 00:52:06,882
Seems you made it with Ken on Saturday.

696
00:52:07,087 --> 00:52:08,973
Hey, listen, listen,

697
00:52:09,631 --> 00:52:11,185
Do you know where Megumi is?

698
00:52:12,551 --> 00:52:14,188
No idea.

699
00:52:14,970 --> 00:52:17,105
And even if I knew. I wouldn't tell you.

700
00:52:17,806 --> 00:52:20,523
I beg you to think it over and tell us.

701
00:52:22,477 --> 00:52:24,483
Her testimony is vital to reducing

702
00:52:24,646 --> 00:52:27,280
her father's death sentence
to only life in jail.

703
00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:29,538
She wanted him dead.

704
00:52:31,862 --> 00:52:35,160
Once she said:
"I hope he dies, and dies soon."

705
00:52:36,867 --> 00:52:39,714
Tokyo police came here,
after the killing.

706
00:52:40,370 --> 00:52:43,004
That's why she couldn't remain living here.

707
00:52:45,751 --> 00:52:49,464
For how long do the children have to 
pay for the crimes of their parents?

708
00:52:58,013 --> 00:53:00,813
I wish you'd told me 
that you were thinking of going there.

709
00:53:01,850 --> 00:53:03,772
We're thinking of calling your daughter,

710
00:53:04,353 --> 00:53:06,572
as a conduct witness.

711
00:53:06,772 --> 00:53:07,863
She won't come.

712
00:53:08,482 --> 00:53:10,404
Not for me.

713
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:14,245
She just wants me to die as soon
as possible.

714
00:53:14,530 --> 00:53:17,744
Some things are better forgotten,
understand that.

715
00:53:20,285 --> 00:53:21,285
But,

716
00:53:22,287 --> 00:53:24,209
I feel it's important,

717
00:53:24,373 --> 00:53:27,587
that you face clearly
the crime you committed.

718
00:53:29,002 --> 00:53:31,090
- Face it?
- yes.

719
00:53:32,172 --> 00:53:33,893
That's what everyone is doing?

720
00:53:35,926 --> 00:53:37,397
I think so, isn't it?

721
00:53:37,594 --> 00:53:39,849
No, of course not, you see...

722
00:53:44,351 --> 00:53:48,492
You have to pretend not to see a lot
to live out there.

723
00:53:54,027 --> 00:53:55,071
Well...

724
00:53:55,863 --> 00:53:59,825
But I guess you're sorry you killed
your boss, right?

725
00:54:00,701 --> 00:54:02,540
- Sorry?
- Yes.

726
00:54:03,704 --> 00:54:04,704
Really.

727
00:54:05,289 --> 00:54:08,006
That's what you wrote in the letter
to the widow.

728
00:54:09,334 --> 00:54:11,920
Because the other lawyer wanted me to.

729
00:54:13,422 --> 00:54:14,596
Mr. Misumi,

730
00:54:15,757 --> 00:54:19,518
even if you think that way
don't show it on the trial.

731
00:54:19,845 --> 00:54:20,853
I know.

732
00:54:21,138 --> 00:54:23,985
It's going to be a trial
with a people's jury.

733
00:54:30,689 --> 00:54:31,900
Yes, I know.

734
00:54:34,359 --> 00:54:37,077
But I think that man deserved to die.

735
00:54:38,864 --> 00:54:40,252
- Deserved to?
- Yes.

736
00:54:41,783 --> 00:54:43,539
What makes you think that?

737
00:54:55,714 --> 00:54:58,893
There's some people in this world,
who should've never been born.

738
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:03,441
But that doesn't allow you

739
00:55:04,014 --> 00:55:06,434
to kill someone to solve the problem.

740
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:09,530
Don't you solve the problems that way?

741
00:55:16,401 --> 00:55:19,830
When you say that,
are you referring to the death penalty?

742
00:55:32,751 --> 00:55:33,751
Enough for today.

743
00:55:36,755 --> 00:55:37,882
There's nobody...

744
00:55:40,050 --> 00:55:41,640
There's nobody

745
00:55:44,763 --> 00:55:47,148
that shouldn't have been born.

746
00:55:54,773 --> 00:55:55,947
We're done!

747
00:56:19,172 --> 00:56:20,216
I don't know.

748
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:25,348
He seemed like another man,
he was totally changed.

749
00:56:26,638 --> 00:56:27,638
Who?

750
00:56:27,973 --> 00:56:29,266
Misumi.

751
00:56:33,854 --> 00:56:34,981
Let's see.

752
00:56:36,315 --> 00:56:37,315
You've said:

753
00:56:37,858 --> 00:56:41,489
"There's nobody that shouldn't 
have been born".

754
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:42,820
Yes.

755
00:56:43,488 --> 00:56:45,079
You really think so?

756
00:56:45,949 --> 00:56:46,949
Yes.

757
00:56:48,493 --> 00:56:50,000
Don't you agree?

758
00:56:51,121 --> 00:56:52,121
Well...

759
00:56:53,123 --> 00:56:54,297
I don't.

760
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:56,256
I don't agree.

761
00:56:56,835 --> 00:56:58,176
Why not?

762
00:57:00,339 --> 00:57:02,474
I think our lives are defined

763
00:57:03,425 --> 00:57:05,644
without having our will on account.

764
00:57:07,512 --> 00:57:08,853
What do you mean?

765
00:57:12,851 --> 00:57:16,564
Some people are born in circumstances
that they would've never chosen.

766
00:57:17,898 --> 00:57:21,908
And others are deprived of life unjustly. 
No explanations.

767
00:57:58,146 --> 00:57:59,534
Welcome.

768
00:58:11,410 --> 00:58:12,963
It's very good right?

769
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:16,919
They gave it to us in school.

770
00:58:17,583 --> 00:58:19,753
We fought for the remains.

771
00:58:20,919 --> 00:58:23,600
It always came in a small plastic jar.

772
00:58:24,923 --> 00:58:26,679
What do you want?

773
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:40,110
You visited him at his apartment...

774
00:58:41,732 --> 00:58:42,859
Mr. Misumi.

775
00:58:47,196 --> 00:58:49,248
That's what you wanted to ask me?

776
00:58:53,493 --> 00:58:55,380
Well, it isn't normal.

777
00:59:00,584 --> 00:59:02,554
What do you call "normal" exactly?

778
00:59:08,133 --> 00:59:09,133
Sorry.

779
00:59:11,094 --> 00:59:12,934
I haven't asked my question well.

780
00:59:15,641 --> 00:59:17,610
No, it's me who is sorry.

781
00:59:42,459 --> 00:59:44,879
Did Misumi talk about his family?

782
00:59:48,006 --> 00:59:49,006
No.

783
00:59:54,930 --> 00:59:55,930
You see,

784
00:59:57,975 --> 00:59:59,362
he has a daughter.

785
01:00:00,477 --> 01:00:02,778
It seems he hasn't seen her for 30 years.

786
01:00:05,107 --> 01:00:06,613
His daughter has

787
01:00:08,193 --> 01:00:10,613
a problem with her leg.
Like you.

788
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:20,967
I thought that's why you became friends.

789
01:00:24,626 --> 01:00:25,800
I understand.

790
01:00:27,796 --> 01:00:29,007
You didn't know that?

791
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:39,230
Someone says they saw her with him
in the karaoke, next to the station.

792
01:00:40,976 --> 01:00:41,976
Yes.

793
01:00:42,394 --> 01:00:44,280
At the New Year's party.

794
01:00:44,688 --> 01:00:48,152
- Have you never been alone?
- Of course not, this is ridiculous!

795
01:00:50,527 --> 01:00:53,031
Regarding your husband's insurance,

796
01:00:54,198 --> 01:00:56,666
you're the only beneficiary.
Right?


797
01:00:57,701 --> 01:00:58,828
Are you ok?

798
01:01:01,371 --> 01:01:04,669
Turn off the light, 
they can see us from outside.

799
01:01:12,758 --> 01:01:15,557
How could that man be my lover?

800
01:01:15,886 --> 01:01:17,973
Who came up with a story like that?

801
01:01:40,118 --> 01:01:41,542
Take care.

802
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:48,719
After what happened to your father.

803
01:01:52,130 --> 01:01:55,476
You're the only one I can count on.

804
01:01:58,845 --> 01:02:01,610
This pan is too ugly.

805
01:02:02,849 --> 01:02:04,403
Too worn.

806
01:02:07,521 --> 01:02:10,534
If you finally go to university in Hokkaido,

807
01:02:13,819 --> 01:02:16,500
I may very well die from loneliness.

808
01:02:17,573 --> 01:02:18,960
You won't die.

809
01:02:19,908 --> 01:02:21,545
Nobody dies from loneliness.

810
01:02:22,536 --> 01:02:24,422
That only happens to rabbits.

811
01:02:33,714 --> 01:02:35,933
Why is the insurance not paying?

812
01:02:37,551 --> 01:02:38,939
What do you think?

813
01:02:41,346 --> 01:02:44,027
Are you worried about money
at a time like this?

814
01:02:47,352 --> 01:02:50,698
Could it be because even the insurance
company thinks I sent...

815
01:02:52,274 --> 01:02:53,531
to kill him?

816
01:02:56,737 --> 01:02:59,869
If you worry so much,
why don't you tell them the truth?

817
01:03:01,575 --> 01:03:05,537
The money wasn't to kill him.
It was for the fake tags.

818
01:03:05,746 --> 01:03:07,003
Don't be silly.

819
01:03:11,043 --> 01:03:12,763
If I say that,

820
01:03:14,213 --> 01:03:16,182
the factory would go bankrupt.

821
01:03:20,761 --> 01:03:24,225
If it's making money
doing something that repugnant,

822
01:03:25,057 --> 01:03:27,026
it should go bankrupt.

823
01:03:32,981 --> 01:03:35,236
Now you're talking like a child.

824
01:03:38,028 --> 01:03:39,914
That dirty money

825
01:03:42,074 --> 01:03:44,328
has taken care of you until now.

826
01:03:50,457 --> 01:03:51,845
I know.

827
01:03:56,505 --> 01:03:59,637
You'll be called to testify as well.
You know, right?

828
01:04:03,345 --> 01:04:04,345
Listen.

829
01:04:06,557 --> 01:04:08,692
Answer only what is strictly necessary.

830
01:04:13,313 --> 01:04:14,571
Have you heard me?

831
01:04:19,236 --> 01:04:21,288
What's strictly necessary?

832
01:04:28,245 --> 01:04:31,009
What does that mean?

833
01:04:33,333 --> 01:04:34,544
You already know.

834
01:04:36,253 --> 01:04:38,258
Don't say anything about the factory.

835
01:04:44,052 --> 01:04:46,057
Or your father.

836
01:04:50,767 --> 01:04:51,767
Why?

837
01:04:53,437 --> 01:04:55,358
What about my father?

838
01:05:01,570 --> 01:05:03,373
You see, your father...

839
01:05:06,450 --> 01:05:08,419
didn't have all the blame.

840
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:37,488
Yes?

841
01:05:38,273 --> 01:05:39,365
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Hello</i></font>

842
01:05:39,816 --> 01:05:40,816
Yuka.

843
01:05:42,694 --> 01:05:45,375
This is a bad time,
I'm working.

844
01:05:52,454 --> 01:05:54,839
Have you gotten in trouble again?

845
01:05:56,250 --> 01:05:57,543
<font color="#ffff00"><i>No, not at all.</i></font>

846
01:05:59,336 --> 01:06:00,380
Okay.

847
01:06:01,588 --> 01:06:03,344
That's good.

848
01:06:06,093 --> 01:06:09,557
<font color="#ffff00"><i>If something happens to me again,
would you come to help me?</i></font>

849
01:06:14,393 --> 01:06:15,436
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Would you?</i></font>

850
01:06:21,233 --> 01:06:23,320
Yes, of course.

851
01:06:24,653 --> 01:06:25,994
<font color="#ffff00"><i>You wouldn't say no?</i></font>

852
01:06:27,573 --> 01:06:28,573
No, I wouldn't.

853
01:06:29,575 --> 01:06:30,868
I'd help you.

854
01:06:33,704 --> 01:06:34,712
But...

855
01:06:35,497 --> 01:06:38,843
that doesn't authorize you to do
something stupid.

856
01:06:38,959 --> 01:06:40,216
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Don't worry.</i></font>

857
01:06:42,504 --> 01:06:43,975
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Because everything's alright.</i></font>

858
01:06:58,812 --> 01:07:04,812
- I'm sorry.
<font color="#ffff00"><i>- For what?</i></font>

859
01:07:09,573 --> 01:07:10,747
I'm sorry

860
01:07:13,994 --> 01:07:17,422
I haven't spent enough time with you...

861
01:07:21,627 --> 01:07:22,968
ever.

862
01:07:55,744 --> 01:08:00,465
The prosecution will insist
that it was a robbery murder.

863
01:08:00,624 --> 01:08:02,296
But be patient.

864
01:08:03,502 --> 01:08:07,298
As we have rehearsed, as soon as you 
are called to testify by defense,

865
01:08:07,548 --> 01:08:08,675
remember,

866
01:08:09,174 --> 01:08:12,437
most important is to say you never 
intended to rob him of his wallet.

867
01:08:12,928 --> 01:08:13,972
I understand.

868
01:08:14,972 --> 01:08:18,852
And... that the principal offender 
in this entire affair is the wife.

869
01:08:19,935 --> 01:08:22,984
She asked you to kill him.

870
01:08:23,605 --> 01:08:25,195
- Yes.
- Good.

871
01:08:28,735 --> 01:08:29,909
Sorry,

872
01:08:31,572 --> 01:08:34,620
do you really believe that story?

873
01:08:35,742 --> 01:08:36,742
Sorry?

874
01:08:36,952 --> 01:08:40,914
Yes, about the robbery
and the life insurance.

875
01:08:43,333 --> 01:08:46,928
It does give us more chances to win, right?

876
01:08:50,215 --> 01:08:52,849
Well, of course,
I won't deny that's the case...

877
01:08:53,594 --> 01:08:57,188
speaking only from the legal perspective.

878
01:08:58,682 --> 01:09:01,731
Mr. Shigemori, what do you think
the real motive was?

879
01:09:04,104 --> 01:09:06,738
- The real motive?
- Yes.

880
01:09:07,733 --> 01:09:09,121
Why did I do it?

881
01:09:11,278 --> 01:09:14,909
It's possible you don't want 
to know the truth.

882
01:09:17,451 --> 01:09:18,708
No, I'm interested.

883
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:22,042
So, tell me.

884
01:09:26,418 --> 01:09:27,418
Okay,

885
01:09:29,421 --> 01:09:31,343
but I'll ask you something first.

886
01:09:32,382 --> 01:09:34,767
You want a hint...
Okay.

887
01:09:40,557 --> 01:09:41,981
That cross symbol.

888
01:09:43,143 --> 01:09:44,614
What did you mean by it?

889
01:09:50,484 --> 01:09:52,952
Is it like a judgement against you?

890
01:09:54,321 --> 01:09:55,413
Judgement?

891
01:09:55,989 --> 01:09:56,989
Yes.

892
01:09:58,242 --> 01:09:59,499
For your crime.

893
01:10:00,911 --> 01:10:02,003
Which crime?

894
01:10:04,998 --> 01:10:06,885
That I don't know.

895
01:10:14,007 --> 01:10:15,847
I don't judge anyone.

896
01:10:17,678 --> 01:10:20,691
I'm the one who's constantly judged.

897
01:10:29,481 --> 01:10:32,411
Remember? I told you that
one of the canaries escaped.

898
01:10:34,486 --> 01:10:35,486
Yes.

899
01:10:35,821 --> 01:10:36,821
He didn't.

900
01:10:38,073 --> 01:10:40,209
I let him escape.

901
01:10:59,052 --> 01:11:00,725
I wonder if someone,

902
01:11:02,055 --> 01:11:04,641
somewhere,
plays with our lives.

903
01:11:06,393 --> 01:11:08,232
Like I did with the lives of the canaries.

904
01:11:11,648 --> 01:11:13,653
If it is so, I'd like to meet him.

905
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:18,289
Meet him to tell him

906
01:11:21,825 --> 01:11:23,379
that it's not fair.

907
01:11:27,623 --> 01:11:28,623
But...

908
01:11:32,502 --> 01:11:35,551
you haven't been treated unjustly
up to now.

909
01:11:40,594 --> 01:11:42,397
My father, my mother,

910
01:11:44,431 --> 01:11:45,523
my wife.

911
01:11:46,850 --> 01:11:49,947
Nobody did anything,
but misfortune killed them.

912
01:11:52,356 --> 01:11:54,325
However, I'm still here.

913
01:11:57,361 --> 01:12:01,325
The life of people is already decided.
<i>(La vida de las personas está decidida.)</i>

914
01:12:01,782 --> 01:12:03,834
Without taking their wishes into account.

915
01:12:07,246 --> 01:12:08,456
It's unfair!

916
01:12:17,005 --> 01:12:19,010
What you just said, where...?

917
01:12:24,471 --> 01:12:25,515
No, leave it.

918
01:12:32,771 --> 01:12:33,945
Why did you...

919
01:12:36,775 --> 01:12:39,326
send a postcard to the judge when you
were released?

920
01:12:43,490 --> 01:12:45,163
Because I was envious and I admired him.

921
01:12:48,787 --> 01:12:51,551
A judge can do whatever he wants
with the lives of others.

922
01:13:27,492 --> 01:13:29,046
Room 404.

923
01:13:29,453 --> 01:13:31,256
Would the accused please enter.

924
01:13:48,347 --> 01:13:49,984
Remove his handcuffs.

925
01:14:00,859 --> 01:14:02,200
Everyone stand.

926
01:14:20,837 --> 01:14:22,843
Court is now in session.

927
01:14:23,674 --> 01:14:26,010
Would the accused approach the dais.

928
01:14:36,687 --> 01:14:38,490
What's your full name?

929
01:14:39,147 --> 01:14:40,571
Misumi Takashi.

930
01:14:41,525 --> 01:14:43,328
Date of birth.

931
01:14:44,027 --> 01:14:47,160
December 1st, 1959.

932
01:14:48,532 --> 01:14:50,703
The public trial is now open.

933
01:14:51,034 --> 01:14:54,167
You're accused of homicide
and corpse mutilation.

934
01:14:55,163 --> 01:14:58,545
The prosecutor will proceed
to read the charges.

935
01:14:59,543 --> 01:15:00,543
Yes.

936
01:15:04,882 --> 01:15:06,139
These are the charges.

937
01:15:06,717 --> 01:15:09,600
The accused decided to kill
Yamanaka Mitsuo,

938
01:15:09,761 --> 01:15:12,941
50 years old. With the intention
of robbing him.

939
01:15:13,223 --> 01:15:17,280
At approximately 12:30 am
on the night of October 11th 2017,

940
01:15:17,394 --> 01:15:19,233
alongside the shore of the Tama River.

941
01:15:19,396 --> 01:15:22,694
The accused struck the victim 
repeatedly with a wrench.

942
01:15:23,567 --> 01:15:25,204
I ask the accused,

943
01:15:25,569 --> 01:15:29,792
if the prosecutor accusation
contains any erroneous declaration.

944
01:15:30,199 --> 01:15:31,199
Yes.

945
01:15:32,242 --> 01:15:35,208
I didn't kill him with the intention
of taking his wallet.

946
01:15:35,579 --> 01:15:36,587
His wife.

947
01:15:37,289 --> 01:15:40,219
Called Mizue,
asked me to kill him.

948
01:15:42,419 --> 01:15:43,419
Your honor.

949
01:15:44,213 --> 01:15:46,681
With the end in mind of 
refreshing the witness's memory,

950
01:15:46,924 --> 01:15:50,103
I would like to present
defense evidence number one,

951
01:15:50,344 --> 01:15:54,484
the email that the witness sent
the accused on September 27th.

952
01:15:57,059 --> 01:15:58,102
Go ahead.

953
01:16:05,192 --> 01:16:07,446
I ask you, regarding this email,

954
01:16:08,028 --> 01:16:11,125
to explain to us exactly what 
you are referring to.

955
01:16:12,449 --> 01:16:14,834
It's about a work issue.

956
01:16:15,786 --> 01:16:17,043
Which work?

957
01:16:18,956 --> 01:16:20,925
Honestly, I do not know.

958
01:16:21,250 --> 01:16:25,307
My husband took care of everything
related to the factory.

959
01:16:26,630 --> 01:16:28,682
I guess he gave him an order.

960
01:16:36,974 --> 01:16:38,065
Regarding,

961
01:16:38,517 --> 01:16:41,364
500,000 yen, over his usual salary, right?

962
01:16:42,479 --> 01:16:45,243
Wasn't that payment to fulfill an order 
given in a message from your phone?

963
01:16:46,483 --> 01:16:47,610
I don't know.

964
01:16:48,110 --> 01:16:51,075
I just know my husband sent it 
from my phone.

965
01:16:53,282 --> 01:16:57,125
So the accused lies when saying that
you hired him to kill your husband?

966
01:16:58,662 --> 01:17:00,299
I believe so.

967
01:17:01,123 --> 01:17:05,299
You better ask him.
I don't understand anything that's happening.

968
01:17:08,839 --> 01:17:11,936
Didn't you promise him
that if he killed your husband,

969
01:17:12,092 --> 01:17:15,390
you'd pay him 10 million yen 
of the 80 million of insurance?

970
01:17:15,512 --> 01:17:16,512
Of course not.

971
01:17:16,597 --> 01:17:19,527
- Wasn't the 500,000 an advance payment?
- Not at all.

972
01:17:20,225 --> 01:17:23,191
At approximately 8 o'clock on the night 
of October 13th,

973
01:17:23,437 --> 01:17:25,358
two days after the crime...

974
01:17:41,246 --> 01:17:43,501
Exactly where is this?

975
01:17:45,626 --> 01:17:47,298
At the river's side.

976
01:17:47,628 --> 01:17:49,680
What were you both doing there?

977
01:17:51,632 --> 01:17:54,100
Mr. Misumi had made a campfire.

978
01:17:54,635 --> 01:17:57,103
I was going by there,
on my way back from the library.

979
01:17:57,638 --> 01:17:59,690
I told him it was my birthday.

980
01:17:59,848 --> 01:18:02,696
And he said, "We'll make a snow mound".

981
01:18:06,271 --> 01:18:08,442
Soon after, I told him everything.

982
01:18:09,566 --> 01:18:10,566
Here?

983
01:18:11,443 --> 01:18:12,443
Yes.

984
01:18:14,071 --> 01:18:15,494
When did

985
01:18:16,615 --> 01:18:17,659
your father

986
01:18:18,325 --> 01:18:19,325
start with...?

987
01:18:21,203 --> 01:18:22,793
I was fourteen.

988
01:18:25,290 --> 01:18:26,631
To be blunt,

989
01:18:27,668 --> 01:18:30,551
was he abusing you sexually?

990
01:18:32,881 --> 01:18:33,881
Yes.

991
01:18:35,884 --> 01:18:37,770
Then, did he rape you?

992
01:18:41,723 --> 01:18:42,851
Exactly.

993
01:18:47,020 --> 01:18:48,492
Mr. Misumi

994
01:18:50,899 --> 01:18:52,453
did it for me.

995
01:18:56,029 --> 01:18:57,121
Just because of that.

996
01:18:58,615 --> 01:19:00,418
Mr. Misumi and my mother

997
01:19:01,159 --> 01:19:02,999
have nothing to do.

998
01:19:05,622 --> 01:19:10,094
Are you willing to testify to this
on the witness stand?

999
01:19:11,420 --> 01:19:14,137
- Yes. 
- Because you want to save him?

1000
01:19:15,632 --> 01:19:16,632
Yes.

1001
01:19:19,177 --> 01:19:23,354
But you didn't ask him to kill
your father, right?

1002
01:19:27,269 --> 01:19:28,313
No, but

1003
01:19:30,105 --> 01:19:33,985
deep inside I wanted someone to 
kill him.

1004
01:19:36,278 --> 01:19:38,828
Mr. Misumi discovered that.

1005
01:19:42,284 --> 01:19:43,755
But how,

1006
01:19:44,536 --> 01:19:45,580
did he find out?

1007
01:19:48,123 --> 01:19:49,594
He understood.

1008
01:19:52,044 --> 01:19:53,171
I know.

1009
01:19:54,963 --> 01:19:55,963
Where did

1010
01:19:56,965 --> 01:19:58,139
he rape you?

1011
01:20:02,554 --> 01:20:03,681
In...

1012
01:20:05,891 --> 01:20:06,935
In a hotel?

1013
01:20:07,184 --> 01:20:08,184
At home?

1014
01:20:08,393 --> 01:20:11,276
- On the river shore?
- Shigemori, not now.

1015
01:20:11,438 --> 01:20:13,075
It's very important.

1016
01:20:15,943 --> 01:20:18,742
The prosecution will ask that
without a doubt.

1017
01:20:19,988 --> 01:20:21,661
Where and how many times.

1018
01:20:23,367 --> 01:20:24,838
I can handle it.

1019
01:20:26,078 --> 01:20:27,086
Think about that,

1020
01:20:27,579 --> 01:20:30,758
they'll be trying to undermine
your testimony, the prosecution

1021
01:20:32,209 --> 01:20:33,762
will investigate your friends,

1022
01:20:34,711 --> 01:20:36,598
will find out if you've shoplifted.

1023
01:20:36,755 --> 01:20:39,804
Everything will come to light
in the trial.

1024
01:20:41,426 --> 01:20:42,426
Yes.

1025
01:20:43,387 --> 01:20:45,024
Also the thing about your leg.

1026
01:20:47,766 --> 01:20:48,940
My leg?

1027
01:20:49,601 --> 01:20:50,601
Exactly.

1028
01:20:51,061 --> 01:20:53,066
It seems you tell everyone

1029
01:20:53,230 --> 01:20:55,567
that you injured yourself falling
off a roof.

1030
01:20:57,651 --> 01:20:59,122
That's not a lie.

1031
01:21:00,904 --> 01:21:02,458
I threw myself off the roof.

1032
01:21:05,409 --> 01:21:06,619
Be aware,

1033
01:21:06,910 --> 01:21:10,089
they will make several harsh questions.
Will you be able to handle it?

1034
01:21:11,623 --> 01:21:12,916
It won't be nice.

1035
01:21:13,667 --> 01:21:14,878
can you endure?

1036
01:21:20,215 --> 01:21:22,101
Until recently...

1037
01:21:25,804 --> 01:21:28,189
it was much harder,

1038
01:21:30,767 --> 01:21:32,358
when I couldn't tell anyone.

1039
01:21:41,445 --> 01:21:43,699
We'll be in touch with you.

1040
01:21:44,823 --> 01:21:45,823
Yes.

1041
01:21:49,328 --> 01:21:50,881
Do you want a candy?

1042
01:21:56,835 --> 01:21:59,089
The stairs are steep, be careful.

1043
01:22:05,302 --> 01:22:06,310
Sorry.

1044
01:22:09,139 --> 01:22:10,139
Thanks

1045
01:22:11,141 --> 01:22:12,482
for telling us this.

1046
01:22:14,686 --> 01:22:15,686
But.

1047
01:22:18,232 --> 01:22:19,359
Why?

1048
01:22:24,112 --> 01:22:25,584
Because

1049
01:22:28,158 --> 01:22:29,546
I don't want

1050
01:22:31,495 --> 01:22:33,714
to close my eyes, like my mother did.

1051
01:23:11,743 --> 01:23:13,334
You can't sleep?

1052
01:23:15,622 --> 01:23:17,176
Neither can you?

1053
01:23:18,667 --> 01:23:21,004
The cold woke me up

1054
01:23:25,048 --> 01:23:27,018
Don't get too cold

1055
01:23:28,260 --> 01:23:30,680
- You're getting old.
- Shut up.

1056
01:23:32,055 --> 01:23:33,064
Hey,

1057
01:23:35,183 --> 01:23:38,398
do you know a story
told by the Chinese?

1058
01:23:38,979 --> 01:23:40,735
It's a popular tale

1059
01:23:42,191 --> 01:23:46,070
of some people who can't see.

1060
01:23:46,904 --> 01:23:50,866
They are all in front of an elephant,
touching it.

1061
01:23:51,450 --> 01:23:52,458
I know.

1062
01:23:54,119 --> 01:23:56,836
The one touching his trunk argues

1063
01:23:57,122 --> 01:23:59,459
with the one touching its ear

1064
01:24:00,959 --> 01:24:02,513
because nobody can distinguish

1065
01:24:03,212 --> 01:24:04,849
the trunk from the ear.

1066
01:24:05,005 --> 01:24:06,262
Exactly, that's the one.

1067
01:24:08,258 --> 01:24:11,852
I bet you feel like that right now.

1068
01:24:13,430 --> 01:24:15,482
You're absolutely right.

1069
01:24:17,935 --> 01:24:18,978
And

1070
01:24:21,563 --> 01:24:23,236
I wonder,

1071
01:24:25,484 --> 01:24:27,489
what part I'm touching right now.

1072
01:24:38,288 --> 01:24:39,925
Am I judging?

1073
01:24:43,502 --> 01:24:45,139
Am I saving?

1074
01:26:26,271 --> 01:26:27,363
Hello.

1075
01:26:32,110 --> 01:26:33,950
Excuse me for coming so late.

1076
01:26:34,446 --> 01:26:35,573
On the contrary.

1077
01:26:36,240 --> 01:26:37,793
I couldn't sleep.

1078
01:26:42,996 --> 01:26:44,170
I came

1079
01:26:45,582 --> 01:26:47,303
to talk you about Sakie.

1080
01:26:50,128 --> 01:26:51,682
Remember this photo?

1081
01:26:56,009 --> 01:26:58,061
February 15th of this year,

1082
01:26:58,971 --> 01:27:00,442
in the snowstorm.

1083
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:03,111
Sakie and you

1084
01:27:04,142 --> 01:27:06,278
took a selfie near the river.

1085
01:27:08,021 --> 01:27:09,314
That day.

1086
01:27:10,816 --> 01:27:12,157
According to her,

1087
01:27:12,943 --> 01:27:15,244
she opened up with you and confessed

1088
01:27:16,154 --> 01:27:18,290
that her father raped her regularly.

1089
01:27:22,119 --> 01:27:23,376
I don't remember.

1090
01:27:26,164 --> 01:27:27,208
I see.

1091
01:27:29,334 --> 01:27:30,378
But

1092
01:27:32,337 --> 01:27:34,140
you remember this postcard.

1093
01:27:36,341 --> 01:27:39,972
The postcard you sent my father

1094
01:27:42,639 --> 01:27:43,683
dated

1095
01:27:44,391 --> 01:27:45,649
February 20th,

1096
01:27:46,351 --> 01:27:48,191
five days after the selfie.

1097
01:27:51,356 --> 01:27:52,697
For you,

1098
01:27:54,860 --> 01:27:56,331
Sakie became

1099
01:27:57,321 --> 01:27:59,290
the daughter you haven't seen in years.

1100
01:28:02,075 --> 01:28:03,333
Wanting

1101
01:28:04,494 --> 01:28:06,250
to save Sakie,

1102
01:28:07,539 --> 01:28:09,509
you decided to kill her father

1103
01:28:15,047 --> 01:28:17,515
You guessed she wanted to kill him.

1104
01:28:18,508 --> 01:28:20,146
That's what she told you?

1105
01:28:20,552 --> 01:28:22,640
That an outright lie.

1106
01:28:23,847 --> 01:28:24,939
A lie?

1107
01:28:28,060 --> 01:28:29,151
Mr. Shigemori.

1108
01:28:30,854 --> 01:28:31,862
That girl

1109
01:28:32,356 --> 01:28:34,491
lies a lot, everyone knows it

1110
01:28:36,693 --> 01:28:37,821
Ok, but

1111
01:28:38,904 --> 01:28:42,914
explain to me why would she lie
to help you.

1112
01:28:44,117 --> 01:28:46,538
You better ask her.

1113
01:28:50,249 --> 01:28:52,467
Allow me to ask you something else.

1114
01:28:53,210 --> 01:28:54,210
Sure.

1115
01:28:54,753 --> 01:28:56,390
About the day of the crime.

1116
01:28:56,797 --> 01:28:57,797
Yes.

1117
01:29:00,759 --> 01:29:04,472
How did you manage to make your boss
come with you to the river?

1118
01:29:05,973 --> 01:29:07,610
- How? 
- Yes.

1119
01:29:08,976 --> 01:29:10,186
He had fired you.

1120
01:29:12,479 --> 01:29:13,902
No offense,

1121
01:29:15,148 --> 01:29:18,328
but for starters,
he wouldn't come with someone like you.

1122
01:29:18,986 --> 01:29:21,406
I told him it was something 
very important.

1123
01:29:22,990 --> 01:29:24,543
What was so important?

1124
01:29:31,498 --> 01:29:32,791
The fake tags.

1125
01:29:35,836 --> 01:29:37,307
Fake tags?

1126
01:29:39,006 --> 01:29:40,347
Yeah, fake tags.

1127
01:29:41,675 --> 01:29:42,932
Once a month,

1128
01:29:44,052 --> 01:29:46,437
flour from an unknown destination

1129
01:29:46,972 --> 01:29:48,942
came illegally to the factory.

1130
01:29:50,517 --> 01:29:54,361
He bought the flour for nothing
and used it in place of good flour.

1131
01:29:56,481 --> 01:29:58,154
A repulsive practice.

1132
01:29:59,568 --> 01:30:00,568
So,

1133
01:30:01,820 --> 01:30:03,541
the 500,000 yen...

1134
01:30:06,325 --> 01:30:08,745
Yeah, it was the money for that.

1135
01:30:15,459 --> 01:30:16,847
But, why...

1136
01:30:17,794 --> 01:30:19,597
did you came up with that lie?

1137
01:30:29,097 --> 01:30:30,770
To judge her?

1138
01:30:33,143 --> 01:30:34,354
For being a mother

1139
01:30:39,399 --> 01:30:41,036
that pretended not to see

1140
01:30:42,319 --> 01:30:44,158
what the father did to his daughter?

1141
01:30:50,911 --> 01:30:51,955
Mr. Shigemori.

1142
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:54,080
Tell me.

1143
01:30:56,959 --> 01:30:57,959
No...

1144
01:30:58,919 --> 01:31:00,675
You wouldn't believe me anyway.

1145
01:31:00,963 --> 01:31:02,350
No, tell me.

1146
01:31:03,924 --> 01:31:05,051
What's it about?

1147
01:31:09,263 --> 01:31:10,556
It's a lie.

1148
01:31:14,268 --> 01:31:15,268
A lie?

1149
01:31:15,769 --> 01:31:16,769
Yes.

1150
01:31:17,729 --> 01:31:20,031
I have never been to that place
near the river.

1151
01:31:22,025 --> 01:31:23,025
What?

1152
01:31:24,111 --> 01:31:25,534
The truth

1153
01:31:26,905 --> 01:31:28,198
is that I didn't kill him.

1154
01:31:30,868 --> 01:31:32,754
what do you mean you didn't?

1155
01:31:35,205 --> 01:31:36,297
That's the truth,

1156
01:31:36,957 --> 01:31:38,168
I didn't kill him.

1157
01:31:43,046 --> 01:31:44,046
But.

1158
01:31:45,883 --> 01:31:46,883
Why

1159
01:31:47,926 --> 01:31:49,267
are you telling this to me now?

1160
01:31:51,722 --> 01:31:54,439
Why didn't you say it from the start?

1161
01:31:55,517 --> 01:31:56,609
I did.

1162
01:31:58,228 --> 01:32:00,447
I told everyone I didn't do it.

1163
01:32:02,232 --> 01:32:05,032
The police, the prosecutors.

1164
01:32:06,570 --> 01:32:07,958
Even the lawyer.

1165
01:32:09,156 --> 01:32:10,959
- The lawyer?
- Yes.

1166
01:32:13,035 --> 01:32:15,004
When you came to see me that first time.

1167
01:32:17,080 --> 01:32:18,338
Settsu?

1168
01:32:19,249 --> 01:32:20,249
Yes.

1169
01:32:22,586 --> 01:32:23,586
He advised me

1170
01:32:25,172 --> 01:32:26,513
to stop lying.

1171
01:32:30,052 --> 01:32:32,388
If I confessed,
I would avoid the death penalty.

1172
01:32:35,432 --> 01:32:36,440
But...

1173
01:32:38,769 --> 01:32:39,769
But

1174
01:32:40,270 --> 01:32:42,406
even if you're not sent to die.

1175
01:32:43,649 --> 01:32:45,451
They'll put you in jail again.

1176
01:32:45,776 --> 01:32:46,820
I prefer that

1177
01:32:48,403 --> 01:32:51,084
to work for a boss
that decieves people.

1178
01:32:53,992 --> 01:32:56,496
In jail,
at least I don't have to lie.

1179
01:33:03,168 --> 01:33:04,722
Do you believe me?

1180
01:33:06,421 --> 01:33:07,513
Mr. Shigemori.

1181
01:33:11,552 --> 01:33:12,595
But.

1182
01:33:15,180 --> 01:33:16,438
You've always said...

1183
01:33:20,102 --> 01:33:21,110
And now

1184
01:33:21,937 --> 01:33:24,523
you want me to believe this story?

1185
01:33:26,733 --> 01:33:27,733
Exactly.

1186
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:33,120
- Give me a minute.
- Sure.

1187
01:33:35,200 --> 01:33:36,921
I knew it, you don't believe me.

1188
01:33:38,412 --> 01:33:41,591
Let's see, Misumi. Tell me.
Did someone came to prison?

1189
01:33:42,916 --> 01:33:44,387
To see you?

1190
01:33:45,460 --> 01:33:46,460
Tell me!

1191
01:33:47,087 --> 01:33:48,087
No.

1192
01:33:48,547 --> 01:33:51,726
- Just you.
- Man, come on.

1193
01:33:53,594 --> 01:33:54,934
That's enough!

1194
01:33:55,762 --> 01:33:58,017
I want to know the truth!

1195
01:34:12,863 --> 01:34:14,334
Don't worry.

1196
01:34:15,115 --> 01:34:16,289
They can't hear you.

1197
01:34:20,954 --> 01:34:22,128
The wallet?

1198
01:34:24,124 --> 01:34:25,465
You stole from him.

1199
01:34:26,460 --> 01:34:27,587
The wallet.

1200
01:34:28,462 --> 01:34:29,553
Did you steal it?

1201
01:34:30,923 --> 01:34:31,923
Yes.

1202
01:34:32,799 --> 01:34:35,385
I stole it the day of the crime.

1203
01:34:38,639 --> 01:34:41,189
I threatened the boss, to reveal
the fake tags thing.

1204
01:34:43,810 --> 01:34:44,902
And the money?

1205
01:34:48,273 --> 01:34:50,195
I sent it to my daughter.

1206
01:34:52,611 --> 01:34:53,655
The burn

1207
01:34:54,738 --> 01:34:55,949
in your hand?

1208
01:34:58,492 --> 01:35:00,663
I made a campfire the previous night.

1209
01:35:04,665 --> 01:35:06,634
So, the river shore...

1210
01:35:09,503 --> 01:35:11,804
I told you already
I wasn't there that night!

1211
01:35:15,342 --> 01:35:16,434
It's the truth.

1212
01:35:18,554 --> 01:35:20,855
You've told me, you weren't there.

1213
01:35:30,566 --> 01:35:32,037
Do you belive me now?

1214
01:35:43,787 --> 01:35:44,831
You

1215
01:35:47,916 --> 01:35:49,637
are my client.

1216
01:35:54,464 --> 01:35:56,719
So, I represent your interests.

1217
01:35:59,386 --> 01:36:00,386
Now,

1218
01:36:03,223 --> 01:36:07,185
to deny the facts at this time
is the worst legal strategy possible.

1219
01:36:07,394 --> 01:36:09,980
I don't care about the legal
strategy!

1220
01:36:13,942 --> 01:36:17,324
All I'm asking you is if you believe 
me, nothing else!

1221
01:36:34,087 --> 01:36:35,215
I understand you.

1222
01:36:39,134 --> 01:36:40,427
You understand me?

1223
01:36:54,691 --> 01:36:56,245
Do you want to take a chance?

1224
01:36:58,862 --> 01:37:00,250
Are you sure?

1225
01:37:01,990 --> 01:37:02,990
Yes!

1226
01:37:44,366 --> 01:37:47,296
No way, is he saying that now?

1227
01:37:47,452 --> 01:37:48,452
Yes.

1228
01:37:49,705 --> 01:37:51,959
He says his lawyer advised him
to confess

1229
01:37:52,124 --> 01:37:53,927
in order to avoid the death penalty.

1230
01:37:56,044 --> 01:37:57,847
Don't listen to him.

1231
01:37:58,046 --> 01:38:00,301
You'll see how he changes stories 
again.


1232
01:38:01,216 --> 01:38:04,645
I think we should focus in Sakie's 
testimony.

1233
01:38:04,803 --> 01:38:06,274
In other words.

1234
01:38:06,722 --> 01:38:10,020
The three of us recognize
he committed the crime?

1235
01:38:10,225 --> 01:38:12,943
And who would believe he didn't?

1236
01:38:13,103 --> 01:38:15,239
There is no eye witness.

1237
01:38:16,190 --> 01:38:17,400
Let's see,

1238
01:38:17,941 --> 01:38:21,239
The only tangible evidence
of the prosecution is his confession.

1239
01:38:21,528 --> 01:38:22,528
It's simple,

1240
01:38:22,696 --> 01:38:24,369
he's starting to be afraid.

1241
01:38:25,073 --> 01:38:26,627
The trial has begun,

1242
01:38:26,783 --> 01:38:29,583
the death penalty is real,
he starts to improvise.

1243
01:38:29,745 --> 01:38:33,126
- It happens a lot.
- No, this man isn't like that.

1244
01:38:33,248 --> 01:38:36,012
- And how would you know?
- Because I know.

1245
01:38:36,543 --> 01:38:39,841
This story is becoming dangerous.

1246
01:38:40,088 --> 01:38:41,132
Dangerous?

1247
01:38:41,757 --> 01:38:43,050
See.

1248
01:38:43,717 --> 01:38:47,264
This man is capable of doing this, 
look at it.

1249
01:38:47,429 --> 01:38:49,565
Can a human being do this?

1250
01:38:49,723 --> 01:38:52,938
A father like that deserves to be killed!

1251
01:38:55,270 --> 01:38:56,611
Deserves?

1252
01:39:04,196 --> 01:39:06,248
The prosecutor is right.

1253
01:39:09,451 --> 01:39:11,172
You're one of those lawyers

1254
01:39:11,578 --> 01:39:14,841
that prevent the criminals
from facing their crimes.

1255
01:39:16,416 --> 01:39:17,674
We'll lose.

1256
01:39:19,586 --> 01:39:20,586
And

1257
01:39:21,547 --> 01:39:24,726
we'll play an awful part
in front of the judge.

1258
01:39:28,595 --> 01:39:29,687
Maybe.

1259
01:39:31,098 --> 01:39:33,233
But if he denies having done that

1260
01:39:34,476 --> 01:39:37,691
as a lawyer,
I must guide myself from his word.

1261
01:39:42,693 --> 01:39:44,780
Please make two lines.

1262
01:39:47,322 --> 01:39:50,834
The family of the victim will 
take the stand today. 

1263
01:39:50,993 --> 01:39:53,461
People are lining up
to obtain tickets and...

1264
01:40:20,189 --> 01:40:21,197
Does he deny it?

1265
01:40:21,648 --> 01:40:22,648
Yes.

1266
01:40:23,901 --> 01:40:25,324
He says he didn't kill him.

1267
01:40:28,113 --> 01:40:29,113
What?

1268
01:40:31,950 --> 01:40:33,077
That being the case,

1269
01:40:34,119 --> 01:40:37,832
we'd rather have you not saying

1270
01:40:38,498 --> 01:40:40,967
he did it to save you.

1271
01:40:44,963 --> 01:40:46,174
We're sorry.

1272
01:40:52,054 --> 01:40:53,311
I have to testify.

1273
01:41:08,987 --> 01:41:10,161
We're sorry.

1274
01:41:13,825 --> 01:41:15,416
I beg you to allow me

1275
01:41:17,496 --> 01:41:18,753
to tell the truth.

1276
01:41:26,380 --> 01:41:28,716
Are you saying you want to testify

1277
01:41:31,093 --> 01:41:36,014
to please your sense of justice?

1278
01:41:36,388 --> 01:41:36,393

1279
01:41:40,310 --> 01:41:41,651
Of course not.

1280
01:41:43,230 --> 01:41:44,784
You wanted to save him,

1281
01:41:45,899 --> 01:41:46,899
Right?

1282
01:41:54,116 --> 01:41:55,116
Yes.

1283
01:41:56,243 --> 01:41:57,631
If that's so,

1284
01:41:58,954 --> 01:42:01,635
mustn't your desire overcome

1285
01:42:03,417 --> 01:42:05,220
anything else?

1286
01:42:13,969 --> 01:42:18,026
Can you tell me, 
what are your feelings towards the accused?

1287
01:42:20,517 --> 01:42:23,021
He brutally murdered your beloved father

1288
01:42:23,770 --> 01:42:26,404
With the only end of robbing him.
Right?

1289
01:42:31,445 --> 01:42:33,580
I'm sure that Mr. Misumi

1290
01:42:35,991 --> 01:42:39,455
didn't kill my father
to steal his wallet.

1291
01:42:42,372 --> 01:42:44,128
I will ask again.

1292
01:42:44,541 --> 01:42:46,262
What kind of punishment do you want

1293
01:42:46,543 --> 01:42:48,679
the accused to have?

1294
01:42:54,927 --> 01:42:57,097
I don't want him to die.

1295
01:43:10,734 --> 01:43:12,870
Is there anything you would want

1296
01:43:13,529 --> 01:43:15,368
to say to your late father?

1297
01:43:19,743 --> 01:43:20,917
So?

1298
01:43:31,547 --> 01:43:35,260
I am thankful for him
giving me life and educating me.

1299
01:43:41,139 --> 01:43:44,521
The night of October 11th.

1300
01:43:45,644 --> 01:43:47,731
You waited in front of the plant

1301
01:43:48,272 --> 01:43:50,277
for your boss to come back, right?


1302
01:43:52,025 --> 01:43:53,069
Yes.

1303
01:43:54,027 --> 01:43:55,581
What was your intention?

1304
01:43:57,573 --> 01:44:00,919
I wanted to threaten him
so he would give me his wallet.

1305
01:44:02,953 --> 01:44:06,002
I was angry at him
because he just fired me.

1306
01:44:08,083 --> 01:44:09,839
What happened with the wallet?

1307
01:44:10,586 --> 01:44:12,139
I took it from him.

1308
01:44:13,380 --> 01:44:15,634
But that's it, I didn't do anything else.

1309
01:44:17,886 --> 01:44:19,855
I didn't go to the river shore.

1310
01:44:21,263 --> 01:44:22,355
I didn't kill him.

1311
01:44:24,391 --> 01:44:27,155
I object, this is not about
opposing charges.

1312
01:44:27,269 --> 01:44:28,941
I told them it wasn't me!

1313
01:44:30,147 --> 01:44:32,567
- A prosecutor followed me to the bathroom.
- Your honor. No...

1314
01:44:32,733 --> 01:44:35,414
He said that if I confessed,
I would avoid the death penalty.

1315
01:44:35,694 --> 01:44:36,952
Silence, please.

1316
01:44:37,613 --> 01:44:40,412
Where does the defense want to go 
with this?

1317
01:44:40,866 --> 01:44:42,622
They all agree.

1318
01:44:42,868 --> 01:44:44,339
We oppose the facts.

1319
01:44:44,494 --> 01:44:47,378
Even the lawyer advised me
to declare myself guilty.

1320
01:44:47,789 --> 01:44:49,426
If I didn't wanted to die.

1321
01:44:49,625 --> 01:44:52,128
Accused! I order you to be silent!

1322
01:44:52,253 --> 01:44:54,424
Nobody believes anything I say.

1323
01:44:55,047 --> 01:44:56,174
That's why

1324
01:44:57,549 --> 01:44:59,270
I beg you to listen to the truth.

1325
01:44:59,885 --> 01:45:00,929
Your honor.

1326
01:45:01,845 --> 01:45:03,268
I didn't kill him.

1327
01:45:07,684 --> 01:45:09,072
- Excuse me.
- Please.

1328
01:45:09,728 --> 01:45:11,733
Counselor, what are you trying to do?

1329
01:45:12,189 --> 01:45:14,360
We will proceed to demonstrate the 
intentional robbery.

1330
01:45:15,276 --> 01:45:18,124
The accused has suddenly changed his declaration.

1331
01:45:19,112 --> 01:45:21,200
So, what are you going to do?

1332
01:45:22,032 --> 01:45:23,622
Do you object to the facts?

1333
01:45:24,285 --> 01:45:26,705
No, we do not object to the facts.

1334
01:45:26,912 --> 01:45:28,999
YES! We do object to the facts.

1335
01:45:30,415 --> 01:45:31,626
Make up your mind.

1336
01:45:32,251 --> 01:45:34,421
We can't go through with this.

1337
01:45:34,586 --> 01:45:36,140
We object.

1338
01:45:38,590 --> 01:45:40,430
What does the prosecutor say?

1339
01:45:41,260 --> 01:45:43,977
The defense had accepted the charge
of homicide.

1340
01:45:44,596 --> 01:45:47,894
Now there will be a retrial.

1341
01:45:57,943 --> 01:45:59,533
Defense counselor,

1342
01:45:59,945 --> 01:46:03,825
I would rather go ahead
and debate the accusation now.

1343
01:46:08,954 --> 01:46:11,837
Yes, let's carry on with the trial.

1344
01:46:13,625 --> 01:46:18,097
I understand the prosecutor's position
but this is an extemporary declaration.

1345
01:46:19,381 --> 01:46:21,885
The defense would rather continue
with the trial.

1346
01:46:22,467 --> 01:46:24,852
We must think of the jury too.

1347
01:46:25,013 --> 01:46:28,145
No, we should establish guilt first and...

1348
01:46:45,490 --> 01:46:46,582
Okay.

1349
01:46:48,327 --> 01:46:49,537
Besides.

1350
01:46:50,996 --> 01:46:53,464
It's an objection without foundation.

1351
01:46:54,208 --> 01:46:57,719
Let's think of the cost
that a retrial incurs.

1352
01:46:57,961 --> 01:46:59,717
The costs it has...

1353
01:46:59,880 --> 01:47:01,850
The prosecution will present

1354
01:47:02,090 --> 01:47:04,261
objective evidence of guilt.

1355
01:47:04,676 --> 01:47:07,809
Now that we agree,
the trial will continue.

1356
01:47:21,985 --> 01:47:24,915
I thought
that a retrial was necessary.

1357
01:47:26,198 --> 01:47:28,583
It seems the judge doesn't
think it's proper.

1358
01:47:30,327 --> 01:47:32,628
They all have exchanged looks.

1359
01:47:33,414 --> 01:47:35,336
You had an agreement. 

1360
01:47:37,251 --> 01:47:39,053
The judge was very clear

1361
01:47:39,211 --> 01:47:43,054
that having a retrial won't affect
his final decision in the least.

1362
01:47:46,134 --> 01:47:47,558
Nobody believes that Misumi

1363
01:47:48,429 --> 01:47:49,722
is not the killer.

1364
01:47:51,557 --> 01:47:53,396
We can't do anything.

1365
01:47:53,892 --> 01:47:57,071
The judge musn't delay
the conclusion of a trial.

1366
01:47:57,229 --> 01:47:59,448
If he wants to keep his reputation.

1367
01:48:00,274 --> 01:48:02,445
And even if we are in different shores.

1368
01:48:02,609 --> 01:48:05,575
We all sail
in a boat called "justice".

1369
01:48:38,854 --> 01:48:39,854
Take this.

1370
01:48:40,731 --> 01:48:41,822
Eat, eat.

1371
01:48:46,612 --> 01:48:47,612
Come.

1372
01:48:52,701 --> 01:48:53,701
Come.

1373
01:48:54,703 --> 01:48:55,703
Come close.

1374
01:48:56,747 --> 01:48:57,747
Come.

1375
01:49:01,043 --> 01:49:02,799
<i>Come, come close.</i>

1376
01:49:04,296 --> 01:49:05,296
Eat.

1377
01:49:06,673 --> 01:49:07,673
Come.

1378
01:49:09,635 --> 01:49:11,058
- Misumi.
- Yes.

1379
01:49:30,155 --> 01:49:31,958
Come, please. - Thanks.

1380
01:49:32,282 --> 01:49:33,326
Good day.

1381
01:50:05,023 --> 01:50:07,574
I will proceed to give sentence

1382
01:50:07,734 --> 01:50:12,290
in this case of robbery, homicide
and bodily mutilation.

1383
01:50:13,908 --> 01:50:17,502
I sentence the accused to death.

1384
01:50:18,620 --> 01:50:20,791
The reasons given by the accused

1385
01:50:20,956 --> 01:50:25,215
to deny his guilt
are without sense and are irrational.

1386
01:50:25,419 --> 01:50:27,091
The defense argument

1387
01:50:27,255 --> 01:50:29,640
referring to the victim's wallet,
the robbery,

1388
01:50:29,798 --> 01:50:32,384
is inconsistent
in light of the evidence,

1389
01:50:32,551 --> 01:50:34,141
and thus, unacceptable.

1390
01:50:34,929 --> 01:50:37,100
Now regarding the email...

1391
01:50:37,389 --> 01:50:39,809
And given that there was no
conversation

1392
01:50:40,142 --> 01:50:44,152
between the accused and Ms. Mizue
wherein the killing was discussed.

1393
01:50:44,313 --> 01:50:48,654
And no possible mention of
a killing in that mail,

1394
01:50:48,817 --> 01:50:52,697
to interpret it as an order to kill
is mere speculation.

1395
01:50:53,071 --> 01:50:57,164
Besides, the accused confessed 
during the investigation,

1396
01:50:57,326 --> 01:50:59,710
then changed his declaration in the trial,

1397
01:50:59,870 --> 01:51:01,341
invalidating his defense.

1398
01:51:01,623 --> 01:51:04,091
with the intention of getting...

1399
01:51:18,805 --> 01:51:20,098
Thank you.

1400
01:52:52,608 --> 01:52:53,818
I'm sorry.

1401
01:53:00,949 --> 01:53:03,903
What he predicted,

1402
01:53:04,620 --> 01:53:06,922
that's exactly what happened.

1403
01:53:08,750 --> 01:53:11,086
Nobody is telling the truth here.

1404
01:53:14,213 --> 01:53:15,387
Nobody?

1405
01:53:23,222 --> 01:53:24,859
Who decides,

1406
01:53:26,892 --> 01:53:29,482
who is to judge?

1407
01:55:12,581 --> 01:55:13,874
The cherry trees...

1408
01:55:16,335 --> 01:55:17,592
in front of the building where I live,

1409
01:55:18,754 --> 01:55:21,803
the blossoms are this big.

1410
01:55:22,591 --> 01:55:24,311
They are about to open.

1411
01:55:26,053 --> 01:55:28,852
Cherry trees blossom very soon here.

1412
01:55:32,184 --> 01:55:34,070
In Hokkaido

1413
01:55:34,394 --> 01:55:37,360
they blossom at the end of April, 
right?

1414
01:55:38,357 --> 01:55:39,448
That's right.

1415
01:55:42,110 --> 01:55:44,116
Closer to May's celebration.

1416
01:56:00,128 --> 01:56:01,339
I've thought

1417
01:56:02,172 --> 01:56:04,426
what drove you to say

1418
01:56:06,301 --> 01:56:08,104
you didn't commit the crime.

1419
01:56:12,516 --> 01:56:14,651
You could've accepted the crime.

1420
01:56:16,228 --> 01:56:17,236
in order that

1421
01:56:19,274 --> 01:56:22,239
Sakie not be forced to talk about
painful things.

1422
01:56:27,364 --> 01:56:28,752
Is that why you did it?

1423
01:56:32,411 --> 01:56:33,538
Is that why you denied it

1424
01:56:35,122 --> 01:56:36,759
deliberately?

1425
01:56:42,964 --> 01:56:44,138
Mr. Shigemori,

1426
01:56:46,049 --> 01:56:47,049
tell me.

1427
01:56:47,718 --> 01:56:49,189
Is that a question?

1428
01:56:53,432 --> 01:56:56,481
No, I guess that isn't a question.

1429
01:57:02,065 --> 01:57:04,948
Can I ask you something else?

1430
01:57:09,948 --> 01:57:11,704
Is that the reason that drove you

1431
01:57:12,951 --> 01:57:14,873
to accept my sudden change?

1432
01:57:17,999 --> 01:57:18,999
Yes.

1433
01:57:21,168 --> 01:57:22,758
Was I wrong?

1434
01:57:30,135 --> 01:57:31,227
It's...

1435
01:57:32,888 --> 01:57:34,644
a good story.

1436
01:57:36,934 --> 01:57:38,487
A very good one.

1437
01:57:43,774 --> 01:57:47,831
I have always thought
I shouldn't have been born.

1438
01:57:50,572 --> 01:57:51,865
Why...

1439
01:57:52,449 --> 01:57:53,449
are you saying that?

1440
01:57:56,371 --> 01:57:57,371
Because...

1441
01:57:58,080 --> 01:57:59,633
I harm...

1442
01:58:00,874 --> 01:58:03,722
everyone around me
with my mere presence.

1443
01:58:13,011 --> 01:58:16,475
But if what you've said is true.

1444
01:58:18,934 --> 01:58:20,322
Then even I...

1445
01:58:21,812 --> 01:58:23,781
can help someone.

1446
01:58:30,237 --> 01:58:31,660
Even dealing...

1447
01:58:32,906 --> 01:58:34,460
with a murder?

1448
01:58:36,368 --> 01:58:37,368
Yes.

1449
01:58:39,538 --> 01:58:41,258
If what you've said is true

1450
01:58:41,790 --> 01:58:42,882
of course.

1451
01:58:46,087 --> 01:58:47,298
Then,

1452
01:58:50,382 --> 01:58:51,556
according to you,

1453
01:58:53,844 --> 01:58:55,931
I'm only wishing

1454
01:58:57,180 --> 01:58:58,391
it's true?

1455
01:59:01,436 --> 01:59:03,156
You should not put...

1456
01:59:04,563 --> 01:59:06,117
too much hope...

1457
01:59:06,940 --> 01:59:08,577
in a killer like me.

1458
01:59:14,823 --> 01:59:16,034
Be that as it may,

1459
01:59:19,578 --> 01:59:21,670
are you only

1460
01:59:22,247 --> 01:59:23,939
an empty pot?

1461
01:59:26,376 --> 01:59:27,385
What does that mean?

1462
01:59:28,337 --> 01:59:31,308
...being a "pot"?
