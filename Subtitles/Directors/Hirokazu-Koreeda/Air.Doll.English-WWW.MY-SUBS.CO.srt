1
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:15,970
I'm home

2
00:02:18,973 --> 00:02:22,017
I should've listened to you
and taken my umbrella

3
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:24,353
I'm dripping wet

4
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:30,234
So I called him outside on his
lunch break and I told him,

5
00:02:30,401 --> 00:02:33,779
"There's lots of guys waiting
to take your place"

6
00:02:34,113 --> 00:02:37,032
Right at the busiest time
of the lunch hour,

7
00:02:37,158 --> 00:02:39,869
he was just spacing out
in the kitchen

8
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:42,037
He's totally useless

9
00:02:42,997 --> 00:02:45,749
Who does he think runs that place?

10
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:50,671
What?

11
00:02:51,881 --> 00:02:55,509
I think he's 3 years younger than me

12
00:02:56,552 --> 00:02:59,680
That's right, he's an only child

13
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:03,309
His parents totally spoiled him
Unbelievable

14
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,520
Well, who cares about him anyway

15
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:16,780
What do you think?
It's so late already

16
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:19,241
Skip the bath tonight?

17
00:03:35,466 --> 00:03:39,386
Nozomi...
You're beautiful

18
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:57,655

Yes, just a moment

21
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,098
Welcome

22
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:55,314
It's so cold

23
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:59,318
You're beautiful today, too

24
00:06:03,072 --> 00:06:04,531

29
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:22,205
Oh, I forgot

30
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:23,040
Off you go!

31
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:24,833
I'm off!

32
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:30,380

45
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:02,764
Do you remember when
that family

46
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:06,435
was murdered in that
upper-class neighborhood?

47
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:10,605
It says here it happened
on the 20th of last month

48
00:12:10,981 --> 00:12:14,401
A judge and his wife

49
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,278
and their daughter, a pianist

50
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:19,740
Each of them murdered in
their sleep, late at night

51
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:24,953
The murderer was already arrested
He was a failed student

52
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:28,081
Her parents wouldn't let him
date their daughter

Movies are made with film

72
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:11,568
Light passes through it

Right

You never watched a movie?

76
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:25,707
That's just a substitute. You have to
watch movies in a movie theater

77
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:28,710
Movie... theater?

78
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:31,880
Kids these days are unbelievable

79
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:34,382
What have you seen
at a theater recently?

80
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:35,800
Me?

81
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:38,052
You know...

82

Don't worry, don't worry

89
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:14,631
It'll be fine. Don't worry
about what your boss told you

90
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:19,719
I don't see you that way at all

91
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:21,721

92
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:26,309

00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:29,270
that useless guy in charge

94
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:32,482
What are they thinking?
Right, exactly

95
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:36,778
Thank you very much

96
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:40,240

What?

99
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:08,226
What?

100
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:14,315
Wasn't "Battles" great?

101
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:18,945
“I've still got bullets left,
Yamamori san"

103
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:27,328
Part Two is "Hiroshima"
Want to rent both?

What are you doing
for Christmas, Nozomi?

105
00:21:35,837 --> 00:21:37,547
With your boyfriend?

106
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,553
Your boyfriend,
your favorite guy

107
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:47,724
You have one, right?

108
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:49,976
No

109
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:51,519
Really?

110
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:53,396
Yes

111
00:21:58,359 --> 00:21:59,944
The first time

112
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:04,198
I asked out my wife was
to see “Love Story"

113
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:08,578
<i>I told a lie</i>

Chaplin's “The Great Dictator"

118
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:33,102
Junichi likes musicals

119
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:37,482
Musicals are fun movies
with singing and dancing

120
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:43,404
"There's Something About Mary"
is supposed to be really funny

121
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:01,816
The water's just right

122
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:10,992
You've got to get all the way in

123
00:24:14,912 --> 00:24:18,499
Your only flaw is that
your body's so cold

124
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:25,506
Can you tell?

125
00:24:26,883 --> 00:24:29,886
Smells great
It's a popular shampoo

126
00:24:30,011 --> 00:24:32,847
I spent 100 Yen more than
the usual shampoo

127
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:40,980
100 Yen makes a big difference

128
00:24:42,565 --> 00:24:44,150
Great...

129
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:24,440
Lucky you
You don't age

130
00:25:25,525 --> 00:25:29,987
I... found a white hair
down there

131
00:25:31,531 --> 00:25:33,241
What a shock

132
00:25:36,202 --> 00:25:39,247
I wonder how much longer
I can make love with you

133
00:25:57,473 --> 00:26:00,142
So damned pretty

134
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,772
The Winter Triangle

135
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:10,945
Don't make me repeat myself

136
00:26:11,654 --> 00:26:13,739
Can't you ever remember?

137
00:26:15,992 --> 00:26:17,785
There's Sirius

138
00:26:18,536 --> 00:26:20,329
And Procyon

139
00:26:20,663 --> 00:26:22,498
And Betelgeuse

140
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:30,047
That's not true
You're beautiful, too

141
00:26:33,009 --> 00:26:35,970
No point being jealous
of the stars

142
00:27:00,578 --> 00:27:03,998
<i>I am an air doll</i>

143
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:09,003
<i>A substitute for handling
sexual desire</i>

144
00:27:09,337 --> 00:27:14,467
Nozomi...
Always stay beside me

145
00:29:07,121 --> 00:29:09,749
Do you like it?

146
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:40,946
<i>What is up there?</i>

147
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:46,535
<i>Up in the sky, there's air
And clouds float there</i>

148
00:29:47,495 --> 00:29:50,956
<i>At night, the moon
and the stars come out</i>

149
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:56,504
<i>It's invisible so you can't see it
But it's there</i>

150
00:29:57,171 --> 00:30:00,716
<i>You can't see it
But it's there</i>

151
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:04,011
<i>Hard to understand</i>

152
00:30:15,523 --> 00:30:18,275
Is that the ocean?

153
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,779
Yes, that's right

154
00:30:26,617 --> 00:30:28,619
Have you never seen the ocean?

155
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:30,037
No

156
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:34,166
There's so many boats

157
00:30:50,266 --> 00:30:53,894
<i>What does it mean
”To get old?”</i>

158
00:30:55,145 --> 00:30:58,148
<i>It means aging and getting
closer to death</i>

159
00:30:59,233 --> 00:31:00,359
<i>Death ?</i>

160
00:31:00,442 --> 00:31:01,735
<i>Yes</i>

161
00:31:02,236 --> 00:31:04,238
<i>Losing life</i>

162
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:07,157
<i>Life...</i>

163
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:11,912
Even here, you can
smell the sea

164
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:18,752
This smell reminds me
of my childhood

165
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:29,763
Reminds me, too...

166
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,697
You can eat your broccoli

167
00:32:30,991 --> 00:32:32,618
Aren't you going to eat?

168
00:32:35,537 --> 00:32:36,747
No

169
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:51,512
Moe, that's not a comb

170
00:32:51,971 --> 00:32:54,014
But Ariel was doing it

171
00:32:55,391 --> 00:32:57,142
Who?

172
00:32:57,226 --> 00:32:59,853
A-ri-el

173
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:05,275
Oh, Ariel...
Right, she was

174
00:33:06,443 --> 00:33:10,656
You don't know, Daddy
I saw it with Mommy

175
00:33:13,701 --> 00:33:15,077
Oh, excuse me

176
00:33:15,202 --> 00:33:16,412
A beer

177
00:33:16,537 --> 00:33:19,373
And also,
what I asked for before

178
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:21,125
Yes, sir

179
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:27,881
Hey, you ate your carrot?

180
00:33:28,007 --> 00:33:28,799
Yeah

181
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:31,218
Wow!

182
00:33:31,301 --> 00:33:33,846
You can eat the rest then, too

183
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:55,075
Hey, what happened?

184
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,243
A blackout?

185
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:57,745
Is it a blackout?

186
00:34:11,425 --> 00:34:12,968
What?

187
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:14,303
A birthday

188
00:34:14,428 --> 00:34:16,221
A birthday?

189
00:34:18,098 --> 00:34:21,894
They're celebrating the day
she was born into this world

190
00:34:30,736 --> 00:34:33,822
Look, a present from your mom

191
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:37,284
Blow them out

192
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:50,297
Does everybody have one?
A birthday?

193
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:00,974
What's that?

194
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:02,851
White clover

195
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:08,023
White clover...
White clover...

196
00:35:19,493 --> 00:35:21,370
That's a dandelion

197
00:35:22,746 --> 00:35:26,041
Is this about to be born, now?

198
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:27,835
No, it's already wilted

199
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:32,506
Poor thing

200
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:35,259
But it has to die someday

201
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,512
Otherwise the world
would be overrun

202
00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:43,892
Hard to understand

203
00:36:42,993 --> 00:36:45,037
What else do you
want to know?

204
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:04,973
I want to know
more about you

205
00:38:22,509 --> 00:38:24,553
"Candy..."

206
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:28,932
"5,980 Yen"

207
00:39:01,423 --> 00:39:03,133
I'm home

208
00:39:08,597 --> 00:39:10,557
Were you lonely?

209
00:39:16,146 --> 00:39:19,608
Okabe suddenly
took the day off

210
00:39:19,733 --> 00:39:23,403
What's he thinking...

211
00:39:26,073 --> 00:39:29,451
<i>I'm an air doll</i>

212
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:34,915
<i>A late model, cheap one...</i>

213
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:02,025
A girl called Ari or Mari
or something,

214
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:06,113
is combing her hair with a fork,
like this...

215
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:12,536
You don't know?

216
00:40:13,245 --> 00:40:15,205
Oh, no...

217
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:20,127
That must be “The Little Mermaid"
It's over here

218
00:40:20,252 --> 00:40:23,046
Oh, you have it
Thanks

219
00:40:23,964 --> 00:40:25,715
I'm sorry...

220
00:40:27,217 --> 00:40:31,805
A movie with a super-bad cop in it

221
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:36,852
Like a totally corrupt cop, making
bad drug deals, rotten to the core

222
00:40:37,144 --> 00:40:38,228
Rotten?

223
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:40,480
Yeah. got anything?

224
00:40:40,647 --> 00:40:42,315
Then, how about,

225
00:40:42,441 --> 00:40:44,693
“Bad Lieutenant," Abel Ferrara

226
00:40:44,818 --> 00:40:45,944
Is it really bad?

227
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:48,989
It's more than bad
Harvey Keitel is the worst

228
00:40:49,114 --> 00:40:50,031
The worst...

229
00:40:50,157 --> 00:40:52,367
Why don't you rent
"Donnie Brasco," too?

230
00:40:52,492 --> 00:40:54,619
AI Pacino plays a guy in the mafia

231
00:40:54,703 --> 00:40:56,538
- And Johnny Depp is a cop?
- Yeah

232
00:40:56,663 --> 00:40:58,832
- I already saw it
- Oh, you did

233
00:41:01,877 --> 00:41:03,211
Excuse me...

234
00:41:07,257 --> 00:41:09,509
You can wipe them off with this

235
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,470
The lines

236
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,638
Lines?

237
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,069
Lines?

238
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:30,071
"Dreams?"

239
00:41:30,197 --> 00:41:30,947
“Dream..."

240
00:41:31,031 --> 00:41:32,365
"Dream?"

241
00:41:33,533 --> 00:41:37,412
OK, how about Theo Angelopoulos'

242
00:41:37,871 --> 00:41:39,873
“The Beekeeper"

243
00:41:40,165 --> 00:41:41,416
Gelo?

244
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:43,001
Angelo...

245
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:46,546
Across the river there's
a big DVD store

246
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:51,718
You can't rent “Dream of Light,"
You have to buy it

247
00:41:51,885 --> 00:41:55,222
“The Beekeeper" comes in a box set,

248
00:41:55,305 --> 00:41:58,350
so you probably can't rent it,
even there

249
00:42:03,813 --> 00:42:05,190
Thanks

250
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:08,318
Across the river...

251
00:42:11,154 --> 00:42:12,739
Thank you

252
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:15,325
I'm sorry...

253
00:42:16,618 --> 00:42:19,037
I am useless...

254
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:31,633
What's your name?

255
00:42:32,425 --> 00:42:34,761
Look at the flowers

256
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:37,889
What's the flower called?

257
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:42,644
Excuse me

258
00:42:45,438 --> 00:42:46,982
I'm sorry

259
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:48,984
I'm sorry

260
00:42:55,782 --> 00:42:57,409
I'm sorry

261
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:04,958
Excuse me

262
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:28,857
Say, do you know a bug
called the mayfly?

263
00:43:31,526 --> 00:43:33,486
The mayfly...

264
00:43:33,903 --> 00:43:38,366
Dies a day or two
after it gives birth

265
00:43:38,908 --> 00:43:41,828
So its body is empty

266
00:43:41,911 --> 00:43:44,789
No stomach or intestines

267
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:49,753
It's filled with eggs instead

268
00:43:50,879 --> 00:43:54,799
It's a creature that's born
only to give birth

269
00:43:57,844 --> 00:44:00,847
Humans aren't so different

270
00:44:01,348 --> 00:44:03,183
Pointless...

271
00:44:06,186 --> 00:44:09,564
I'm empty, too...

272
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:18,156
A marvelous coincidence
I'm the same...

273
00:44:18,573 --> 00:44:20,367
I'm all empty

274
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:27,791
I wonder if there are others

275
00:44:29,668 --> 00:44:33,963
These days, everybody is

276
00:44:34,047 --> 00:44:35,382
everybody?

277
00:44:35,465 --> 00:44:38,134
Yes, especially,

278
00:44:39,135 --> 00:44:42,514
everyone living in this kind of city

279
00:44:45,892 --> 00:44:48,269
You're not the only one

280
00:44:55,527 --> 00:44:59,197
Say, do you know this poem?

281
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:02,117
Poem?

282
00:45:02,826 --> 00:45:05,245
You don't know poems?

283
00:45:05,745 --> 00:45:07,247
Doesn't matter

284
00:45:08,498 --> 00:45:10,542
"Life is..."

285
00:45:11,292 --> 00:45:13,336
Life is...

286
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,882
Let's see, “life is..."

287
00:45:19,342 --> 00:45:22,220
Let's see, life is?

288
00:46:00,467 --> 00:46:02,135
<i>It seems life</i>

289
00:46:02,218 --> 00:46:06,598
<i>is constructed in a way</i>

290
00:46:06,681 --> 00:46:09,267
<i>that no one can fulfill it alone</i>

291
00:46:16,065 --> 00:46:17,484
<i>Just as</i>

292
00:46:17,817 --> 00:46:21,112
<i>it's not enough for flowers</i>

293
00:46:21,237 --> 00:46:23,406
<i>to have pistils and stamens</i>

294
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:26,576
<i>An insect or a breeze</i>

295
00:46:26,659 --> 00:46:29,829
<i>must introduce a pistil to a stamen</i>

296
00:46:35,752 --> 00:46:40,924
<i>Life contains its own absence,</i>

297
00:46:41,216 --> 00:46:45,011
<i>which only an Other can fulfill</i>

298
00:46:51,935 --> 00:46:56,564
<i>It seems the world
is the summation of Others</i>

299
00:46:57,315 --> 00:46:58,775
<i>And yet,</i>

300
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:03,613
<i>We neither know nor are told</i>

301
00:47:03,696 --> 00:47:07,867
<i>that we will fulfill each other</i>

302
00:47:09,035 --> 00:47:12,288
<i>We lead our scattered lives,</i>

303
00:47:12,372 --> 00:47:15,875
<i>perfectly unaware of each other...</i>

304
00:47:17,919 --> 00:47:21,297
Welcome, would you like
to buy a cake?

305
00:47:21,923 --> 00:47:24,634
The master has come home

306
00:47:24,717 --> 00:47:27,554
Welcome back, Master

307
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:32,475
<i>Or at times, allowed to find</i>

308
00:47:32,725 --> 00:47:35,603
<i>the Other's presence disagreeable</i>

309
00:47:40,567 --> 00:47:42,360
<i>Why is it,</i>

310
00:47:42,443 --> 00:47:47,949
<i>that the world is constructed
so loosely?</i>

311
00:47:51,828 --> 00:47:52,745
I'm Misato

312
00:47:52,829 --> 00:47:54,914
How old are you, Misato?

313
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:55,915
I'm 24

314
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,417
24...

315
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:00,920
Misato, do you know
a good restaurant nearby?

316
00:48:01,045 --> 00:48:02,589
I just started yesterday

317
00:48:02,714 --> 00:48:04,048
I understand

318
00:48:04,132 --> 00:48:05,133
What do you like?

319
00:48:05,258 --> 00:48:06,426
I like pasta

320
00:48:06,509 --> 00:48:08,261
I like pasta, too!

321
00:48:09,012 --> 00:48:10,972
I want Extra Rice

322
00:48:11,097 --> 00:48:13,141
I want Extra Rice, too

323
00:48:13,266 --> 00:48:16,352
Cancel the ham and cheese
hamburg steak

324
00:48:16,436 --> 00:48:17,228
Lunch specials?

325
00:48:17,312 --> 00:48:19,314
More water with lots of ice

326
00:48:19,439 --> 00:48:20,440
Right away

327
00:48:20,523 --> 00:48:24,110
I'll take the lunch special instead

328
00:48:24,193 --> 00:48:25,445
The lunch special?

329
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:28,031
<i>The suspect, Kume, confessed that</i>

330
00:48:28,114 --> 00:48:32,952
<i>he had bought one gram from a foreigner
for 7,000 Yen when he traveled to Osaka</i>

331
00:48:33,077 --> 00:48:35,622
So expensive...

332
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:45,381
<i>A horse fly,</i>

333
00:48:46,299 --> 00:48:48,301
<i>bathed in light,</i>

334
00:48:48,426 --> 00:48:50,970
<i>flies in close</i>

335
00:48:51,095 --> 00:48:54,432
<i>to a blooming flower</i>

336
00:49:00,563 --> 00:49:02,899
<i>I, too, might have been</i>

337
00:49:02,982 --> 00:49:06,235
<i>someone's horse fly</i>

338
00:49:12,659 --> 00:49:14,702

01:20:51,264 --> 01:20:56,394
This stuff annoys me, which is
why I chose you in the first place

508
01:20:59,105 --> 01:21:01,732
I'm annoying...

509
01:21:03,067 --> 01:21:06,070
What a mean thing to say

510
01:21:06,195 --> 01:21:09,282
That's not what I mean, it's not

511
01:21:09,740 --> 01:21:12,869
You're not annoying,
it's humans who are

512
01:21:12,952 --> 01:21:14,829
Nozomi!

513
01:21:22,253 --> 01:21:23,754
Nozomi!

514
01:21:43,441 --> 01:21:45,026
Nozomi!

515
01:23:06,023 --> 01:23:07,608
Thank you

516
01:23:41,559 --> 01:23:43,936
I hate dogs

517
01:23:45,771 --> 01:23:48,441
They get old so fast

518
01:23:49,442 --> 01:23:52,945
and die before you know it

519
01:23:55,489 --> 01:24:01,078
Having a dog just makes you lonely

520
01:24:06,459 --> 01:24:11,505
Is this you?

521
01:24:11,589 --> 01:24:12,757
Yes

522
01:24:13,090 --> 01:24:17,386
I used to be a substitute
high school teacher

523
01:24:20,806 --> 01:24:22,600
A substitute?

524
01:24:23,184 --> 01:24:24,226
That's right

525
01:24:25,603 --> 01:24:29,940
I was always an empty substitute

526
01:24:35,780 --> 01:24:37,782
Were you lonely?

527
01:24:38,616 --> 01:24:41,368
I wonder...

528
01:24:44,038 --> 01:24:47,249
I can't remember anymore

529
01:24:51,962 --> 01:24:53,964
Do you mind,

530
01:24:55,841 --> 01:25:00,096
touching me?

531
01:25:31,961 --> 01:25:34,964
That feels so good

532
01:25:37,341 --> 01:25:41,095
Me, too... See?

533
01:25:43,931 --> 01:25:49,019
They always say,
people with cold hands,

534
01:25:49,687 --> 01:25:53,691
have warm hearts

535
01:25:56,110 --> 01:25:58,821
Maybe it's just a superstition...

536
01:28:02,111 --> 01:28:03,445
Welcome home

537
01:28:06,991 --> 01:28:08,534
I'm home

538
01:28:14,331 --> 01:28:18,085
I made you, but I don't
know the answer

539
01:28:20,754 --> 01:28:23,340
But I doubt even God knows

540
01:28:23,465 --> 01:28:26,969
why the humans
he made have hearts

541
01:28:30,306 --> 01:28:32,683
Do you wish you'd
never found a heart?

542
01:28:38,981 --> 01:28:42,109
I don't know, but...

543
01:28:44,153 --> 01:28:45,904
It hurts

544
01:29:33,535 --> 01:29:36,455
They all started out the same,

545
01:29:38,457 --> 01:29:43,087
but by the time they
come back here,

546
01:29:45,839 --> 01:29:49,510
you can tell from their faces
whether they've been loved

547
01:29:55,140 --> 01:30:00,104
I think that must mean
they all have hearts, too

548
01:30:08,946 --> 01:30:12,324
What will happen to them?

549
01:30:16,453 --> 01:30:19,832
Once a year, in spring,
I throw them all away

550
01:30:21,792 --> 01:30:24,211
Unfortunately, they're
"Not burnable garbage"

551
01:30:25,879 --> 01:30:29,466
Not burnable garbage

552
01:30:31,677 --> 01:30:36,306
After all, once we die,
we're "Burnable garbage"

553
01:30:36,390 --> 01:30:38,559
It's not such a big difference

554
01:30:41,395 --> 01:30:44,898
Burnable garbage

555
01:31:19,766 --> 01:31:22,853
Can you tell me one thing?

556
01:31:25,814 --> 01:31:29,151
Was everything you saw
in this world sad?

557
01:31:31,361 --> 01:31:35,574
Was there something, anything,
that was beautiful?

558
01:31:44,666 --> 01:31:46,293
I'm glad to hear that

559
01:31:50,797 --> 01:31:54,593
Thank you for having me

560
01:31:59,765 --> 01:32:02,184
No, thank you

561
01:32:04,228 --> 01:32:05,604
Off you go

562
01:32:07,898 --> 01:32:09,566
I'm off

563
01:32:30,671 --> 01:32:35,592
<i>I don 't mind if I'm a substitute
for someone else</i>

564
01:32:38,387 --> 01:32:41,807
<i>You're not a substitute for anyone</i>

565
01:32:47,271 --> 01:32:49,523
I'll do anything for you

566
01:32:49,773 --> 01:32:54,111
That's what I was born for

567
01:32:55,279 --> 01:32:59,241
Whatever you want

568
01:33:01,285 --> 01:33:02,619
Really?

569
01:33:03,787 --> 01:33:04,955
Yes

570
01:33:06,123 --> 01:33:09,793
I can do whatever I want?

571
01:33:10,711 --> 01:33:13,630
Yes, whatever you want

572
01:33:18,510 --> 01:33:22,681
I couldn't ask anyone else, but...

573
01:33:23,765 --> 01:33:25,100
With you...

574
01:33:28,562 --> 01:33:31,815
Something only I can do?

575
01:33:33,817 --> 01:33:34,860
Yes

576
01:33:37,029 --> 01:33:38,238
What is it?

577
01:33:41,366 --> 01:33:43,243
I want to let out your air

578
01:33:46,496 --> 01:33:49,666
Let out my air?

579
01:33:52,002 --> 01:33:53,003
Yes

580
01:34:03,180 --> 01:34:03,972
But...

581
01:34:04,097 --> 01:34:05,682
Don't worry

582
01:34:08,185 --> 01:34:11,480
I'll breathe into you
like before

583
01:34:12,898 --> 01:34:14,024
But...

584
01:34:15,901 --> 01:34:17,152
Why?

585
01:34:39,383 --> 01:34:43,720
Sure, do whatever you want

586
01:38:56,681 --> 01:38:59,017
Where's your plug?

587
01:39:33,510 --> 01:39:37,222
I'll fill you with my breath

588
01:39:43,687 --> 01:39:46,022
Just like you did for me

589
01:41:18,656 --> 01:41:20,950
<i>I couldn't breathe</i>

590

591
01:43:59,067 --> 01:44:00,318

592

You are alone

593
01:44:13,289 --> 01:44:14,958

01:44:45,321 --> 01:44:47,949

597
