1
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:51,594
Ikuo, come help us

2
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:54,771
Oh, let him play

3
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,605
Where on earth is the landlord?

4
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:48,113
Dad'll be mad, let's go home!
Let's go home

5
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:53,994
I want to die at home...

6
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,492
So I'm going back to Shikoku

7
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,001
You can't die yet!

8
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:01,622
Anyway, you can only get to Shikoku
on the ferry, Grandma

9
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:04,166
And you don't have any money

10
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:10,181
Grandma wants to die at home
I'm going back to Shikoku

11
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:06,403
Time to come in, Takeshi

12
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,752
Any luck?

13
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:28,759
They just said, “Not again"

14
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,762
No sign of her?

15
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:37,597
So far, no calls reporting
missing grandmas

16
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,228
At least she can't freeze to death

17
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:43,436
We'll wait one more night

18
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:45,104
I hope she's OK...

19
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,445
It's hardly the first time
No big deal

20
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:54,576
But what if she never comes back?

21
00:03:55,944 --> 00:04:00,450
Don't say that
It's not your fault

22
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:05,587
Someone'll bring her back,
always do... right?

23
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,353
Iku-chan

24
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,363
lku-chan

25
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:20,700
- Honey...
- Yeah?

26
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,371
I had that dream again

27
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:31,548
I keep on having it

28
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:34,717
Wonder why

29
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:41,054
I'm not your grandma's reincarnation

30
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,062
Go back to sleep

31
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:57,908
Keep dreaming
Maybe she'll come back...

32
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,527
Maybe...

33
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:10,080
If only I could've kept her
from going then...

34
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:24,418
MABOROSI

35
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,031
How far did you go?

36
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:51,414
The baseball stadium
Better to steal from the rich...

37
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:53,075
You really stole this?

38
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,914
I said I would

39
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:59,916
Maybe whoever stole yours
had been robbed, too

40
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:01,875
Yup, when robbed, rob back

41
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:05,386
Don't let this little taste
make you a real thief

42
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,047
You nut...

43
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,952
The bathhouse was so crowded

44
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:40,460
I bought you some paint

45
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:45,127
Did Yuichi cry?

46
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,466
Not one peep

47
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:51,759
You sure?
What were you up to?

48
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,474
Listening to the neighbor's radio

49
00:09:56,262 --> 00:10:00,642
It's so loud
Shall I ask him to turn it down?

50
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:05,280
Don't bother
The old man's hearing's gone

51
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,156
We get to listen along

52
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:09,317
You haven't changed

53
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,822
VVhatis?

54
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,322
You haven't changed at all

55
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,164
What's that mean?

56
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:18,122
You're the same as
when you were a kid

57
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,002
How the same?

58
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,499
I don't know,
you're just the same

59
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,299
You're impossible

60
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:30,013
He's enjoying himself

61
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:42,517
What's on your mind?

62
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:49,658
Tired from your walk to the stadium?
You're out of it

63
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,486
What's that mean?

64
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:02,713
The trucking company we use
hired a sumo wrestler

65
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:05,548
Really? A sumo wrestler?

66
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:09,215
An ex-sumo wrestler
Had to quit 'cause he was lousy

67
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:12,722
Now he's learning to drive a truck

68
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:17,557
Still hasn't cut off his topknot
A guy in his 30s,

69
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:21,565
taking orders
from 18 year-olds

70
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:30,569
I don't know why
he keeps that topknot...

71
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:32,234
Who knows...

72
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:40,910
Something about that topknot
kind of depresses me

73
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:45,421
But lku-chan...
you don't have a topknot

74
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,925
And your 30s are a long way off

75
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,756
Got a point

76
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:58,601
Hey, a cop...

77
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,604
Just kidding...

78
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,440
Tanaka from the stadium...

79
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,601
Don't scare me

80
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:51,210
I'm taking this

81
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:56,052
Unusual to see you out together

82
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,217
We must reek

83
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:00,719
The minute you came in

84
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,717
Let me guess - okonomiyaki...

85
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,223
Got the neighbor to
look after Yuichi

86
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,222
You've got seaweed on your lip

87
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:08,727
Just kidding

88
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:12,895
Don't let the baby
cramp your love life

89
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:16,072
You absorbing this wisdom?

90
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,573
He knows

91
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:20,736
No, I had to drag him
away from work

92
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:22,199
Ambushed him?

93
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:25,911
I was watching him for along time
and he didn't even notice

94
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,583
How could I know?

95
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:29,205
I would have

96
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:32,747
Seems like you're
getting along fine

97
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,261
Honey...

98
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:48,768
ls my face weird?

99
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:52,230
What's that about?
Did someone say so?

100
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:55,110
Of course not

101
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:59,115
I was looking in the mirror
in the cafe bathroom,

102
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:02,782
and my freckles started
to bother me

103
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:08,792
Looking at my freckles made me think
my whole face was weird

104
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:12,295
So that's why you were
in there so long

105
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:16,796
Remember, a long time
ago you said,

106
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:21,634
“Bet you've got a lot more
freckles waiting to sprout"

107
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:24,470
I kept staring in the mirror,
wondering

108
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:25,633
if I'd get more freckles

109
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,302
I really said that?

110
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,141
You really did

111
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,147
Getting tired?

112
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:33,649
Trade places?

113
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:35,981
I'm happy right here

114
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,477
You're back early

115
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:16,359
The weather's so unpredictable

116
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:19,025
I got you some tangerines

117
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,195
Thanks
Just a minute

118
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,364
Was he a good boy?

119
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,375
A real good boy

120
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:39,709
Maybe he likes the hum
of the sewing machine

121
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:43,337
He's never like that with me

122
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,550
He takes after his father

123
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,382
You really think so?

124
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:50,218
Especially around the eyes

125
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,227
He'll be a handsome one

126
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:53,353
You think?

127
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:57,233
Yes you will, right, Yuichi?

128
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:17,412
<i>Ono Tailoring -
Gentleman's Clothing</i>

129
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:42,771
What are you doing here?

130
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:46,449
Just parking the bike
I was nearby

131
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:48,947
They're predicting rain

132
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,453
Stick around, stranger

133
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:54,457
Maybe next time
Just grabbing the umbrella

134
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,117
I'll walk you down

135
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:57,251
You're a nut...

136
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:58,628
But I want to

137
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:03,633
Comb your hair, it's a mess

138
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,437
ls your husband home?

139
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,776
He's not back yet

140
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:35,777
We found a man who'd
been hit by a train

141
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,954
It may be your husband

142
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:51,634
We found a torn envelope
stuck to his pants

143
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:55,301
It was from the Yamaoka
Dye Factory

144
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:58,967
Your husband is the only
one of their employees

145
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:02,140
we haven't
accounted for

146
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:36,345
I've brought his wife

147
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:46,355
Was this his?

148
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:53,530
Where is my husband?

149
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:59,864
You'll never recognize him

150
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:06,702
We haven't established definitively
that it is your husband

151
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:11,881
It happened in between
stations on the Hanshin Line

152
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:16,841
According to the engineer,
he was walking along the tracks,

153
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:20,552
going the same way as the train

154
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:23,725
There's a gentle curve there,

155
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:28,890
and by the time he noticed him,
it was too late

156
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:32,894
Never reacted to the whistle
or the screeching brakes,

157
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:36,231
just kept right on going...

158
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:50,429
Yumiko

159
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:54,438
Ono san's worried

160
00:23:55,601 --> 00:24:02,325
She says you stare off into space,
while your baby howls

161
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:08,615
She's worried you might
try to kill yourself

162
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:11,500
She keeps checking on you

163
00:24:17,498 --> 00:24:20,172
Leaving such a little baby...

164
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:24,839
Why did lkuo have to die?

165
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:27,679
Well...

166
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:33,022
That's no answer
You sure there weren't any signs?

167
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:37,852
Usually, having a new baby

168
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:41,192
makes a man eager to work

169
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:45,697
But killing himself for no reason...

170
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:49,033
He left you a riddle to solve...

171
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:54,543
But then, what's the point...

172
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:59,044
You're all set
Nice and clean

173
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:05,213
Let's tuck you in while you're warm

174
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:07,047
Thank you

175
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,891
Pull yourself together

176
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:15,224
Yuichi can't do anything for himself

177
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:16,727
Right...

178
00:25:34,575 --> 00:25:36,919
That radio sure is loud

179
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:39,079
Always like that?

180
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:42,257
He's a lonely old man

181
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:47,092
lkuo always said it was his way
of proving he was alive

182
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:52,556
I'm going to come live
with you for a while

183
00:25:52,593 --> 00:25:55,767
Takeshi thought I should, too

184
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:59,604
We can't expect Ono san
to look after you forever

185
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:05,273
Besides, you've got
to consider your future...

186
00:28:51,939 --> 00:28:58,288
Why, Ono san, thank you so much
for everything you've done for us

187
00:28:58,362 --> 00:29:02,117
He lives far away, but he's
a solid, decent man

188
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:03,959
I'll be praying things work out

189
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:07,296
Thank you for
bringing them together

190
00:29:07,788 --> 00:29:11,418
Noto's far away, so
you won't see them often,

191
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:15,304
but Yuichi's ready for school
and he's a good boy

192
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:18,804
I'm sure he'll get along well with
his new father and sister

193
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:20,809
Thank you so much...

194
00:29:39,653 --> 00:29:41,451
Let's go, now

195
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:47,836
Grandma, I got some candy

196
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:50,459
Who gave you that?

197
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:52,670
The old man next door

198
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:57,179
Wasn't that nice
Did you thank him?

199
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,515
Thank you

200
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:45,386
Thank you so much...

201
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:48,396
You take care, now

202
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:51,225
Good bye, Yuichi

203
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:54,900
Off you 9°

204
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:05,869
Yuichi, bye-bye

205
00:31:26,927 --> 00:31:30,272
I'll go with you to Osaka station

206
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:32,440
We're fine

207
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:36,274
It'll only make the goodbyes
that much harder

208
00:36:55,088 --> 00:37:02,939
<i>The North-bound Express
will be arriving on platform...</i>

209
00:37:13,273 --> 00:37:17,619
I'm so sorry
I had a problem at work

210
00:37:17,694 --> 00:37:21,790
I just panicked and
really messed up. I'm sorry

211
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:27,287
Thank you for coming

212
00:37:47,891 --> 00:37:51,145
He's really got guts
sleeping through this

213
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:55,824
He couldn't sit still on the train...

214
00:37:57,066 --> 00:38:01,492
I'm really sorry, but I have
to get right back to work

215
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:03,497
Is that so?

216
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:06,826
I'll come home as soon as I can

217
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:34,649
Take it easy today
You can meet our neighbors tomorrow

218
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:40,322
You already said that
That's the third time

219
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:16,024
I'm going to be your mother, now

220
00:41:19,686 --> 00:41:20,858
OK?

221
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,402
It's really loud, isn't it?

222
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:16,084
It might take you a while
to get used to it

223
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:58,618
Good morning

224
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:03,298
This is my wife, Yumiko

225
00:43:03,456 --> 00:43:04,799
It's nice to meet you

226
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:06,459
She's a real beauty

227
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:11,306
I'll make it formal later
and we'll have a drink

228
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:46,003
It's a tight community so
we've got to make the rounds

229
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:51,506
The old folks get uptight
It's easy to offend them

230
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:54,515
The neighbors are near enough,

231
00:43:54,674 --> 00:43:58,520
but my relatives are scattered
so it's a real chore

232
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:04,526
When we do get together
it's such a sprawling clan...

233
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:06,981
That's no fun, either

234
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:12,032
A real backwater, huh?

235
00:44:12,859 --> 00:44:14,532
The sea's so powerful

236
00:44:14,694 --> 00:44:16,537
Too powerful

237
00:44:42,722 --> 00:44:45,225
It quiets down after
the morning market

238
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:00,368
My new wife

239
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:02,079
I knew that

240
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,578
I'm Yumiko
It's very nice to meet you

241
00:45:04,744 --> 00:45:08,419
At her age, Tomeno san still
takes her own boat out

242
00:45:08,581 --> 00:45:12,586
Why didn't you come
introduce her to me first?

243
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:15,589
I did, I did, but you were out

244
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:18,766
Remember that filthy shack
painted an awful color?

245
00:45:18,925 --> 00:45:23,101
Some excuse, you came too late
You missed me

246
00:45:23,179 --> 00:45:25,432
We found you here

247
00:45:25,598 --> 00:45:27,225
Pure chance

248
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:30,236
We stopped in at work, first

249
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:35,275
He's so damned proud
of that new wife,

250
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:38,615
he's dragged her
all the way out here

251
00:45:38,778 --> 00:45:41,406
I came all this way
so you could see her...

252
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:42,790
Show off!

253
00:45:42,949 --> 00:45:45,623
Gimme alight

254
00:45:46,953 --> 00:45:50,298
No use falling for me now
I'm married with children

255
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:52,633
You're so full of it

256
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:15,815
On this special occasion,

257
00:46:15,982 --> 00:46:18,326
I'd like to celebrate with a song

258
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:22,955
Please clap along with me

259
00:46:22,989 --> 00:46:24,991
These are ready?

260
00:48:39,959 --> 00:48:43,133
Getting warm

261
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:46,807
It sure is

262
00:50:16,472 --> 00:50:19,726
There's so much land

263
00:50:19,892 --> 00:50:22,566
The ocean's even bigger

264
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:07,740
Let's go see what's
on the other side

265
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:10,617
I'll go first

266
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:46,937
Don't, it's dangerous

267
00:51:46,979 --> 00:51:48,981
Whose boat is it?

268
00:51:49,148 --> 00:51:51,321
Nobody's anymore

269
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:54,487
Then I want it

270
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:56,997
But where will you keep it?

271
00:51:57,072 --> 00:51:58,995
In the closet

272
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:17,699
Guess which hand

273
00:53:18,404 --> 00:53:19,747
Wrong

274
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:23,746
Thank you

275
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:26,203
It's all sticky

276
00:53:26,245 --> 00:53:28,919
That's the last one

277
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:06,793
What happened?

278
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:09,796
I found them wandering
around, all worn out

279
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:11,628
so I gave them a lift back

280
00:54:11,749 --> 00:54:13,126
You're so kind

281
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:19,472
Rhubarb

282
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:24,478
You picked such a lot
How many?

283
00:54:24,553 --> 00:54:25,930
Let's count

284
00:55:43,382 --> 00:55:47,228
When I'm in junior high,
I'm going to grow my hair

285
00:55:47,845 --> 00:55:50,223
You'll be even prettier, then

286
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:07,247
I think your dad's getting
silly in the bath

287
00:56:55,287 --> 00:56:57,790
Here it comes

288
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:46,903
Some salt

289
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:48,692
No

290
00:58:49,151 --> 00:58:50,073
Salt?

291
01:00:16,154 --> 01:00:18,498
Time for breakfast

292
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:34,180
I'm 90mg

293
01:00:41,763 --> 01:00:43,515
Off you go
Take care

294
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:44,863
I'm beat

295
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:50,373
And here I'd imagined
relaxing on my day off...

296
01:03:56,541 --> 01:03:59,215
Guess we need that air conditioner

297
01:04:00,378 --> 01:04:03,848
I never thought it'd be
so hot here in the summer

298
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:08,224
Thought there'd be winter
year-round?

299
01:04:08,887 --> 01:04:11,731
I was so shocked
by the cold at first

300
01:04:14,017 --> 01:04:15,735
Bet you were sorry

301
01:04:17,187 --> 01:04:21,909
“I screwed up, coming to
this god-forsaken place," no?

302
01:04:22,067 --> 01:04:23,239
You nut

303
01:04:24,819 --> 01:04:30,747
When I first came back from Osaka,
it was really tough

304
01:04:33,328 --> 01:04:36,423
Couldn't believe I'd been born
and raised here

305
01:04:38,083 --> 01:04:43,089
I'd sworn never to come back
when I left after junior high

306
01:04:49,761 --> 01:04:51,934
Enough, move over

307
01:04:52,055 --> 01:04:53,272
Nope

308
01:04:53,390 --> 01:04:56,439
It's hot
Besides, you're heavy

309
01:04:57,352 --> 01:05:00,447
When you're done,
I'm heavy, huh?

310
01:05:00,647 --> 01:05:02,615
The kids'll be back

311
01:05:02,774 --> 01:05:05,402
I'll keep an eye out from here
Don't worry

312
01:05:05,443 --> 01:05:07,741
Spare me

313
01:05:07,779 --> 01:05:08,780
Nope

314
01:05:08,947 --> 01:05:10,119
Spare me, please

315
01:05:10,198 --> 01:05:11,450
Nope

316
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:13,121
Spare me...

317
01:05:14,619 --> 01:05:16,417
Please...

318
01:05:16,955 --> 01:05:18,798
Spare me...

319
01:06:47,962 --> 01:06:51,216
It's been six months already

320
01:06:51,883 --> 01:06:54,557
Tamio wanted to come, too,

321
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:56,850
but he's afraid to leave
his father alone

322
01:06:56,888 --> 01:06:58,731
Of course he can't

323
01:06:58,890 --> 01:07:03,566
But I'm so happy you
brought Tomoko with you

324
01:07:03,728 --> 01:07:08,074
Takeshi must be doing well
Renting this big apartment

325
01:07:08,233 --> 01:07:10,235
He married a piano teacher,

326
01:07:10,318 --> 01:07:14,414
who's got 3O students
She makes more than he does

327
01:07:14,531 --> 01:07:16,579
A dependable wife

328
01:07:16,741 --> 01:07:21,417
Imagine children playing
lousy piano all clay long

329
01:07:21,579 --> 01:07:23,252
You'd go out of your mind

330
01:07:23,331 --> 01:07:25,925
And this?

331
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,594
This is family, it's different

332
01:07:35,343 --> 01:07:37,437
How are things?

333
01:07:37,595 --> 01:07:40,769
Thanks to your excellent
match-making

334
01:07:40,932 --> 01:07:42,934
Oh, don't exaggerate,

335
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:46,108
but I really was hoping
it would work out

336
01:07:46,229 --> 01:07:51,281
Now and then my husband asks
how you're getting along

337
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:53,111
How's Yuichi doing?

338
01:07:53,945 --> 01:07:55,618
That's wonderful

339
01:08:26,144 --> 01:08:28,112
Hello

340
01:08:28,146 --> 01:08:30,490
What a shock

341
01:08:30,648 --> 01:08:32,446
Thought I'd come back?

342
01:08:32,483 --> 01:08:34,986
I'm here for my brother's wedding

343
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:38,832
Mom's looking after the kids
I'm just wandering

344
01:08:38,990 --> 01:08:42,335
Man, what a surprise

345
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:43,832
You been well?

346
01:08:45,997 --> 01:08:50,503
That day...
What time was it?

347
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:54,180
He popped in for
a cup of coffee and left

348
01:08:55,506 --> 01:08:57,179
What day?

349
01:08:58,343 --> 01:09:01,688
The day...
he died

350
01:09:03,014 --> 01:09:05,688
He stopped in after work,
on his way home

351
01:09:07,685 --> 01:09:10,029
He seemed his usual self,

352
01:09:10,188 --> 01:09:13,032
so I was shocked
when I heard the next day

353
01:09:17,028 --> 01:09:21,875
He just sat there grinning
at my usual jokes

354
01:09:24,619 --> 01:09:28,214
So he got this far home, then...

355
01:09:29,791 --> 01:09:33,045
Said he'd forgotten his wallet,

356
01:09:33,211 --> 01:09:35,339
that he'd hurry home and get it

357
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:37,883
I said, "No rush, anytime"

358
01:09:41,219 --> 01:09:47,397
He said, "Thanks then, I'll owe you
'til tomorrow," and went out smiling

359
01:09:51,145 --> 01:09:55,366
Thinking about it,
it seems like a dream

360
01:12:09,116 --> 01:12:11,869
You still haven't changed?

361
01:12:12,703 --> 01:12:15,877
Hurry up and take a bath,
before the water cools

362
01:12:17,959 --> 01:12:19,381
Tired?

363
01:12:21,212 --> 01:12:24,216
Yuichi and Tomoko
went right to sleep

364
01:12:25,716 --> 01:12:27,718
How was your Mom?

365
01:12:32,557 --> 01:12:36,232
I really should go see her again

366
01:15:29,483 --> 01:15:33,238
I'm going out for crabs
You want any?

367
01:15:36,365 --> 01:15:40,711
Three?
You sure three will do?

368
01:16:20,242 --> 01:16:21,789
What are you staring at?

369
01:16:24,955 --> 01:16:26,298
What's wrong?

370
01:16:30,127 --> 01:16:35,133
Close the window, will you?
We'll get icicles in here

371
01:17:09,667 --> 01:17:12,170
A little homesick?

372
01:17:15,506 --> 01:17:18,009
You're not yourself these days

373
01:17:18,926 --> 01:17:21,520
Do you want to go back to Osaka?

374
01:17:22,513 --> 01:17:24,356
No, I don't

375
01:17:25,015 --> 01:17:28,360
I just had a dream...
It woke me up

376
01:17:37,528 --> 01:17:39,872
Guess what I noticed
the other day?

377
01:17:40,030 --> 01:17:41,373
What?

378
01:17:42,950 --> 01:17:45,874
You've got spots here

379
01:17:45,995 --> 01:17:49,044
No, I don't have spots there

380
01:17:49,206 --> 01:17:52,710
I'm serious
Didn't you know?

381
01:17:54,044 --> 01:17:57,048
Not a clue

382
01:18:16,984 --> 01:18:20,705
They're not spots,
they're freckles

383
01:18:21,363 --> 01:18:23,741
How are they different?

384
01:18:23,824 --> 01:18:25,076
They just are

385
01:18:26,076 --> 01:18:27,749
Nonsense...

386
01:19:14,959 --> 01:19:18,463
Tomeno san took her boat out?

387
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:25,803
I'll check with the fishermen

388
01:20:39,668 --> 01:20:41,386
She'll be fine

389
01:20:43,547 --> 01:20:48,223
She's indestructible
She'll swim back if she has to

390
01:20:51,138 --> 01:20:54,392
Nobody knows the sea
better than she does

391
01:20:55,893 --> 01:20:58,021
She never gets it wrong

392
01:20:59,563 --> 01:21:01,691
I swear she'll be back

393
01:22:41,165 --> 01:22:45,341
Survived, did you?
She's back!

394
01:22:46,462 --> 01:22:48,464
So you're OK?
We were so worried

395
01:22:48,505 --> 01:22:51,349
Mind your own business

396
01:22:54,511 --> 01:22:57,014
She was on the
verge of tears

397
01:22:58,807 --> 01:23:01,356
Just as I promised

398
01:23:01,518 --> 01:23:03,361
Sorry I worried you

399
01:23:04,438 --> 01:23:06,031
You made it back?

400
01:23:06,148 --> 01:23:07,365
That's right

401
01:23:08,775 --> 01:23:10,527
What happened?

402
01:23:10,861 --> 01:23:12,204
We were worried sick

403
01:23:12,321 --> 01:23:15,200
I swam all the way back

404
01:23:33,342 --> 01:23:34,559
Yumiko

405
01:23:38,222 --> 01:23:39,724
Don't trouble yourself

406
01:23:41,558 --> 01:23:42,855
She's indestructible

407
01:24:39,116 --> 01:24:42,290
Can I look at the bicycles?

408
01:24:42,452 --> 01:24:45,456
Sure, but don't go far

409
01:24:47,457 --> 01:24:49,300
Out shopping?

410
01:24:53,589 --> 01:24:55,967
Your first husband's boy...

411
01:24:58,427 --> 01:25:00,805
How old was he?

412
01:25:02,472 --> 01:25:05,146
When his father died?

413
01:25:06,143 --> 01:25:08,817
He was 3 months old

414
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:14,826
Then he doesn't
remember a thing

415
01:25:18,989 --> 01:25:22,163
Maybe that's for the best

416
01:25:24,828 --> 01:25:27,798
It probably is for the best

417
01:26:52,916 --> 01:26:55,760
What...
Stfllup?

418
01:26:56,712 --> 01:26:59,591
What are you doing up?

419
01:26:59,673 --> 01:27:03,928
Waiting for you
Did you drive home?

420
01:27:04,094 --> 01:27:08,099
What else?
Too far to walk...

421
01:27:08,181 --> 01:27:11,606
You shouldn't drive so drunk

422
01:27:13,019 --> 01:27:15,113
Want some water?

423
01:27:15,272 --> 01:27:16,273
Nope

424
01:27:18,608 --> 01:27:21,282
Call me when you're
going to be late

425
01:27:21,361 --> 01:27:23,238
I worry about you

426
01:27:34,249 --> 01:27:35,592
What's that?

427
01:27:38,962 --> 01:27:41,135
What did you just hide?

428
01:27:42,549 --> 01:27:45,143
I didn't hide anything

429
01:27:45,218 --> 01:27:47,141
It's just an old bicycle key

430
01:27:47,304 --> 01:27:49,807
I wanted to take off the bell...

431
01:28:05,071 --> 01:28:06,448
You're a liar

432
01:28:10,619 --> 01:28:12,838
You once told me,

433
01:28:12,996 --> 01:28:17,001
you had to come back here
because of your father

434
01:28:17,667 --> 01:28:18,964
That's right

435
01:28:21,171 --> 01:28:23,344
Tomeno san had a different story

436
01:28:23,507 --> 01:28:28,479
You came back from Osaka
to marry your old sweetheart

437
01:28:29,971 --> 01:28:31,973
You were crazy about her

438
01:28:37,854 --> 01:28:43,031
How could you marry me
after losing someone that special?

439
01:28:44,653 --> 01:28:45,870
How could you?

440
01:28:46,655 --> 01:28:48,328
What the...

441
01:28:49,950 --> 01:28:53,875
You're a liar
A liar...

442
01:29:11,805 --> 01:29:16,902
There, there
Let's talk about it tomorrow

443
01:29:18,395 --> 01:29:23,071
It's a scary conversation
Save it for tomorrow!

444
01:29:47,716 --> 01:29:49,263
What's wrong?

445
01:29:51,928 --> 01:29:54,772
Your silence spooks me

446
01:29:59,769 --> 01:30:02,113
Do you hate it here?

447
01:31:59,764 --> 01:32:01,687
What are you up to?

448
01:32:02,434 --> 01:32:03,651
BasebaH

449
01:32:03,727 --> 01:32:06,526
Baseball's no fun alone

450
01:32:06,980 --> 01:32:08,698
It's not so bad

451
01:32:08,815 --> 01:32:10,863
Where's your mother?

452
01:32:12,819 --> 01:32:14,867
Dunno

453
01:32:14,988 --> 01:32:16,865
You came out here alone?

454
01:41:17,863 --> 01:41:19,240
I just...

455
01:41:22,201 --> 01:41:25,796
I just don't understand...

456
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,753
Why he killed himself...

457
01:41:32,878 --> 01:41:35,597
Why he was walking
along the tracks...

458
01:41:38,134 --> 01:41:43,140
Once I start thinking about it...
I can't stop

459
01:41:44,890 --> 01:41:49,066
Why... do you think he did it?

460
01:41:56,319 --> 01:41:58,663
He said the sea calls you

461
01:42:00,072 --> 01:42:03,622
Dad used to go out to sea

462
01:42:06,912 --> 01:42:12,294
He says when he was out alone,
he used to see a beautiful light,

463
01:42:14,378 --> 01:42:18,929
shimmering in the distance,
calling him

464
01:42:22,261 --> 01:42:24,309
I think it can happen to anyone

465
01:45:06,592 --> 01:45:09,311
What fine weather we're having

466
01:45:14,934 --> 01:45:17,153
A wonderful season, indeed
