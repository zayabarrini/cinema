4
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,280
Hello.

5
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,020
We've just moved into #203.
We're the Fukushimas.

6
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,420
I wanted to meet the landlord.

7
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,550
It's just a token gift.

8
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,250
Thank you for taking the trouble.

9
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,920
It's very nice to meet you.

10
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,260
Um, my husband's abroad,
you see,

11
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,800
so really, it's just the two of us.
I hope you'll look out for us.

12
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,430
Oh, I see.
Don't hesitate to ask.

13
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,870
Thank you very much.
Introduce yourself.

14
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:53,440
I'm Fukushima Akira.

15
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,600
I see. And...

16
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,400
...are you in junior high?
- I'm in sixth grade.

17
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,210
You're so big.

18
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:02,150
Once you get to this age,
it's fine, but little ones...

19
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,280
Well, other tenants tend
to complain about them.

20
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:08,510
Oh, he's very mature.
He'll be no trouble.

21
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:11,850
Fortunately, he takes after his father,

22
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,520
and he's a really good student.

23
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,870
But now that he's in sixth grade,
he's ready to learn English...

24
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,340
Mother.

25
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,950
Hold on.

26
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,800
In the back room, please.

27
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:57,930
The living room?

28
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,100
Yes.

29
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,900
You just know
that landlord remarried.

30
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:28,530
His first wife,
I bet you his first wife died,

31
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,130
and he went and married again.

32
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,540
Just hold on, Shigeru.

33
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,610
What is this!

34
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,180
Just hold on.

35
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:38,440
Here goes.

36
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,550
You okay? Was it hot?

37
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:45,580
It's hot.

38
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:48,210
Wow, you did a great job.

39
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,420
It was hot.

40
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,890
This is your new home.

41
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:53,390
Just hold on, Shigeru.

42
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:55,020
Shall we let Shigeru out...

43
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:55,820
I'll let you out.

44
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:58,690
Here comes the noisy boy.

45
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:02,960
Was it hot?

46
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:04,230
Super hot.

47
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:08,000
You did a great job.
We're here.

48
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:14,640
Okay!
A huge success.

49
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,410
What floor is this?

50
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,610
Our new home is
on the second floor.

51
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,160
Apartment 203.

52
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,920
Get back inside, Shigeru.

53
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,330
What if they see you?

54
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,470
We'll have to move all over again.
Get inside.

55
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:41,440
Get in here!
Hey, Akira.

56
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,240
Get back inside.

57
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:50,710
Shigeru, you've got to
unpack your own toys.

58
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,290
I'll go pick up Kyoko
at the station.

59
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:58,850
Be careful, off you go.
You know the way?

60
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,050
I know.

61
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:01,620
I'm off.

62
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:03,530
Okay, off you go, then.

63
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:35,820
Did you wait?

64
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:36,990
You're late.

65
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,490
I'm sorry.

66
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,770
Is the apartment big?

67
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:48,770
Yeah, it's three rooms.
Pretty big.

68
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,280
The washing machine?

69
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,550
On the veranda.

70
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,310
The veranda, huh?

71
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,650
Kyoko!

72
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,140
We're home.

73
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:33,110
I think I know how
to make the soup.

74
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,310
I know how to make the soup.

75
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,390
Okay, then you make it.

76
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:43,620
Such big chopsticks!
Oh, I'll eat with these.

77
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,660
Yeah! My favorite.

78
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,300
Tasty?

79
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:55,940
May I have everyone's attention?

80
00:06:57,010 --> 00:07:00,780
Now that we've moved
into a new home,

81
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,210
I'm going to explain the rules to you
one more time.

82
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:09,220
Let's promise to keep them, okay?

83
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,450
How many are there?

84
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,290
Okay, first of all,
no loud voices or screaming.

85
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,230
Can you do that?

86
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:17,520
I can.

87
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:21,860
Next, no going outside.

88
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,730
I know.

89
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,600
Can you do that?
Not even out on the veranda.

90
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:30,280
Okay? Can you keep that promise?

91
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,310
Sure!

92
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,880
Can you do it, little Shige-monster?

93
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,310
You're the one that
has to promise hardest.

94
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:43,550
Absolutely no going outside.
Can you do that?

95
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,620
Bet you can-can.

96
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:49,560
He didn't raise his hand.

97
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,830
That's right,
remember our old home...

98
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:56,560
we had to leave because
you always threw such tantrums?

99
00:07:56,670 --> 00:08:00,630
So, now that we've found
a nice new home,

100
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,400
you've got to promise.
Can you?

101
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:06,570
How's Kyoko supposed
to do the laundry?

102
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,910
For the laundry,

103
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,080
there's no choice, but for Kyoko

104
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:14,450
to sneak out quietly for the laundry.

105
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:18,660
Don't go out with her, Shigeru.

106
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:23,390
And Akira,
you already know all this,

107
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:28,600
but Mom's sometimes late,
so you'll be in charge.

108
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:33,470
That's okay, right?
And study a lot.

109
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,670
You really have to get it, Shigeru.

110
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:39,510
Do you get it?

111
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:43,950
If you don't...
it's an enema for you!

112
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:47,380
Not an enema, green peppers.

113
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:48,650
Green peppers?

114
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,520
Why!

115
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,290
Make him eat peppers.

116
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:53,380
Oh, that's it, then.

117
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:57,560
We'll give Shigeru "The Pepper
Punishment," got that?

118
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,790
Next time you're up for a tantrum,
get in the suitcase.

119
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,700
Shut up!

120
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,790
Like I...

121
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,570
That's the time to climb in.

122
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:07,870
That's right, that's right.

123
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,940
What a great idea.

124
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,410
Put him there when he's noisy, okay?

125
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:14,710
We'll all put him in.

126
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,120
Mother.

127
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,260
These tatami mats smell good.

128
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,060
The tatami?
What do they smell like?

129
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:36,900
Like leaves in nature.

130
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:40,870
That's a nice smell, isn't it?

131
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,980
The tatami are still new.
They're still green.

132
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,450
Make you sleep well?

133
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,410
Good night.

134
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:14,830
Will you be late?

135
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:18,170
Today? Let's see...

136
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:22,740
What's today?
Oh, I guess I might...

137
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:24,650
Maybe I'll be late.

138
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,120
You want dinner?

139
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,910
Dinner... dinner...
What's for dinner tonight?

140
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,120
Maybe curry.

141
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:36,790
Curry? I want curry!
Save me some curry.

142
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:38,820
Please.

143
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:41,500
Maybe I'll eat it.

144
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,200
Off you go.

145
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,580
Hey, did Mom leave already?

146
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,310
She just left.

147
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,890
Dangerous.

148
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,880
The piano...

149
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:20,120
I'm going shopping.

150
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:21,460
Off you go.

151
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:24,330
Get me an "Apollo Choco".

152
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,460
Sure.

153
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,550
150 yen.

154
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,560
Shall I buy persimmons...

155
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,530
No "Apollo Choco".

156
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:36,110
There's a video arcade...
"Inageya Hardware Store".

157
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,480
"Near and far-sighted..."

158
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:46,420
Found it.

159
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,710
<i>Apollo Choco</i>

160
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,750
No bag, right?

161
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:58,230
Out of 100 yen, then.

162
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:08,840
Thank you very much.

163
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,350
Save 'em for later...

164
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,680
You okay?

165
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:01,390
I'm fine.

166
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:18,500
The bath's ready, brother.

167
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:19,770
You can go first.

168
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,180
Okay.

169
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,430
Are there carrots?

170
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:39,660
There are carrots.

171
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:41,030
None for me.

172
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,930
No, you have to eat them.

173
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:55,120
Dinner's ready, Kyoko.

174
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,310
Okay.

175
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:26,170
Shigeru left the carrots, again.

176
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:53,300
<i>Elementary Japanese</i>

177
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:11,050
Look, Mother's home.

178
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,150
Hey there, I'm back.

179
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,910
Welcome home.

180
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:44,290
It's damned cold out there.
Warm in here.

181
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:46,190
Weren't you in bed, yet?

182
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:47,950
I was hanging the laundry.

183
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:51,590
What a good girl.
Thank you.

184
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:54,870
And what do we have here?

185
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:58,970
Can I have some?

186
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,500
Damn. It's cold.

187
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:02,670
Welcome home.

188
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:03,540
I'm home.

189
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,630
Oops.

190
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:06,670
Got it?

191
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:07,810
I can't.

192
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,970
No way.

193
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:11,550
It clicked but went out.

194
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:16,250
All yours.

195
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,450
Did I get this right?

196
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,050
What's this?

197
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,120
"A nation that flourished.

198
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,660
"in about 300 C.C."

199
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,790
What don't you understand?

200
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,340
Just wondered if I got it right.

201
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:37,310
No, it should be "300 B.C."

202
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:43,210
When you don't know,
you look it up in here.

203
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,250
That way, you'll learn.

204
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,620
Wow, is this Shigeru's?

205
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,850
Wow, what's this?

206
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,020
This yours? Kyoko's?

207
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:02,730
I hate math...

208
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,270
Six times six is...

209
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:12,540
Six-six, six-six...

210
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:16,810
Hurry, six-six.

211
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,580
I can do it.

212
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:23,450
Six-six is thirty-six...

213
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:31,750
Hello, yes.

214
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:38,060
It's noisy there, awful noisy.

215
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,940
Where are you? Karaoke?

216
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:48,710
Not now, it's too late.

217
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:55,120
What? Who's there?
Oh, really, what a shame...

218
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:54,540
And-a 2.

219
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:57,480
And-a, and-a 3.

220
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:58,910
Hey, oh no.

221
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:01,250
And-a 1, hey.

222
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,820
And-a 3.

223
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,590
And-a, and-a 4.

224
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,890
Wow!

225
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:12,160
Oh, me? And-a, and-a 2.
Wow!

226
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:17,130
Oh, no, I'm the loser who
has to go without dinner!

227
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,830
You won't get sleepy.

228
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:23,640
If there's no lid on,

229
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:27,840
what could be inside?

230
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:29,880
You can't tell.

231
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:33,210
See, if you close your eyes
and put it in,

232
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,790
if you put it in but you don't know...

233
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,970
Mother...

234
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:59,340
I want to go to school.

235
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:04,380
School?
You wouldn't have any fun at school.

236
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:11,220
Besides, when you don't have a Daddy,
they bully you at school.

237
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:14,930
You don't need to go to school.

238
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:24,530
Wow, feels really great.
Great smell, did you smell it?

239
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,710
Stinks of sunlight.

240
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:29,940
Stinks of sunlight?

241
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:34,100
Stinks of sunlight.
What a beautiful day...

242
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,510
Your mother...

243
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:48,190
is in love with someone now.

244
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:49,830
Again?

245
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:56,930
Not again.
This guy's really

246
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:01,800
sweet and serious.

247
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:06,770
I think he is really
looking out for me.

248
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:12,780
So, if he promises to really...

249
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:16,620
to really marry me,

250
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:22,460
then we can all live in a big house
and you can all go to school

251
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,120
and Kyoko can play the piano...

252
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:29,270
So just hang on a little longer.

253
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:32,170
I really think this time, probably...

254
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,070
I'm home.

255
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:48,780
I'm home.

256
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,520
Here we are, sushi.

257
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:56,320
I'm home, meow.

258
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,120
Were you asleep?

259
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:02,630
C'mon, c'mon guys,
the sushi was a present.

260
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:05,990
A sushi present, c'mon, c'mon.

261
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:07,430
You wake up?

262
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:11,970
You wake up? You mad?

263
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:15,840
C'mon over, come over,
c'mon over, Yuki.

264
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:18,770
She stinks of booze.

265
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,320
Aren't you cold?
Were you asleep? I'm sorry.

266
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:27,480
It's just that your Mommy had
a pretty good time today.

267
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,620
Here you are, Mom.

268
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,820
Oh, thank you.

269
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,410
Akira.

270
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,880
Listen, Akira...

271
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,710
he's starting to look
just like his father.

272
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:08,120
He's got his father's eyes, exactly.

273
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,930
You brother's father...

274
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,860
used to work at Haneda.

275
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:22,570
You know what Haneda is?
It's a place with lots of airplanes.

276
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:26,810
You know... right, Shigeru?
That's where he used to work.

277
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,980
Oh, I know... listen, Akira.

278
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:35,590
Remember going to see your father?

279
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:36,880
I don't.

280
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:41,860
We took the Monorail to
get to Haneda Airport.

281
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,760
You forget?

282
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:45,890
Yeah.

283
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:50,260
Kyoko, your father was...

284
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,240
a music producer...

285
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:59,710
I know! Let's give Kyoko's...

286
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:03,080
pretty hands a nice manicure.

287
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:12,190
Your mother... actually...

288
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:17,760
wanted to be a singer.

289
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,930
And I really made it...
part way.

290
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,890
With your father, Kyoko.

291
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,930
Oops, way too much.

292
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:33,040
I was going to cut a record...

293
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,910
And we were almost ready...

294
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:40,040
when the deal fell apart.

295
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:44,890
Your mother really wanted to, but...

296
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,170
<i>Dear Akira,</i>

297
00:28:32,295 --> 00:28:35,179
<i>Your mother's
going away for a little while.</i>

298
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:38,610
<i>Please look after Kyoko,
Shigeru and Yuki.</i>

299
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:00,820
I'm going shopping.

300
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:02,420
Sure, off you go, then.

301
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:06,120
And also, Mother won't be
coming back for a while.

302
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,160
Why not?

303
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:11,400
Something to do with work, I think.
I'm off.

304
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,870
Off you go.

305
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:47,470
<i>Please indicate the account number
for your transfer...</i>

306
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:03,680
The rent... electricity bill,
phone and gas...

307
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:07,390
And also...

308
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:09,690
tissues...

309
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:14,860
Let's go to my office.

310
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,030
Do you always do this?

311
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:28,470
No, I don't.

312
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,370
Your first time?

313
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:33,040
I didn't take anything.

314
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,810
Then what's all this doing here?

315
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:43,580
Your name?

316
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,720
Fukushima Akira.

317
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:49,350
Fukushima... Akira...

318
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,030
School?

319
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,470
Your father's name?

320
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:58,470
I don't have a father.

321
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:00,130
No father?

322
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:04,570
Your mother. Then?

323
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:08,580
She's gone away to work
for a while.

324
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,780
Where did she go?

325
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:15,980
If you won't tell me,
I'll have to call the police.

326
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:17,320
Sir,

327
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,460
I don't think this boy stole that.

328
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:26,260
I think the boys reading comics
over there put them in his bag.

329
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:27,660
It wasn't him?

330
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:29,890
No, I don't think so.

331
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,330
Why didn't you speak up?

332
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,630
I'm sorry.

333
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:37,970
Don't "I'm sorry" me.

334
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:53,120
This is just between us, okay?
The meat buns are a little bonus.

335
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:57,530
Hurry, give it to him.

336
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:04,030
Thank you very much.

337
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,040
Is that a plus sign?

338
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:41,270
That's right.

339
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:52,620
9,824 yen.

340
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:56,590
9,824 yen?

341
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:03,020
I forgot to add this...

342
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,630
Hello.

343
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,680
Isn't this your day off?

344
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:18,390
I'm driving again tonight.
No use going home.

345
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,890
How's your mom?

346
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,690
She hasn't been home in a month.

347
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,490
For real?

348
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,070
How old are you, Akira?

349
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:00,800
I'm 12.

350
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:07,270
And Yuki?

351
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:09,640
Yuki's fine.

352
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:13,640
She takes after me?

353
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:17,080
Yes, she does.

354
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:20,690
For real...

355
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:38,630
Akira!

356
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:44,370
Shit, I'm 10 yen short.
Lend me 10 yen.

357
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:46,870
What, 10 yen?

358
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,740
Why make a big deal over 10 yen?

359
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:50,940
What's with that damned big wallet?

360
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:53,040
It's a hand-me-down
from my mother.

361
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:54,050
From who?

362
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:55,420
From my mother...

363
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:03,490
You moved, right?

364
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:05,820
The new place big?

365
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:08,100
Any pubic hair, yet?

366
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,030
No...

367
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,760
Liar, got mine in 5th grade.

368
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:11,960
No way.

369
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,070
That's the truth.

370
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,040
It's just...

371
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:21,370
What are you smirking about?

372
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:26,810
It's just that since Mother's gone,

373
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,350
It's just, there's no money.

374
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:32,420
For real? I don't have any money.

375
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:35,690
What've you got left?

376
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:36,860
About 10,000 yen.

377
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,430
10,000 yen is enough.

378
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,590
I'm in a hell of a jam, myself.

379
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:47,140
My girlfriend, you know,

380
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:52,830
she totally maxed out my credit cards.
I'm in credit card hell, man.

381
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:56,510
So I'm working my ass off,
slowly paying it off, man.

382
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:11,720
This is all I've got on me.
This is it, the last time.

383
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,260
Thank you.

384
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:16,570
All right, I'm off.

385
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:20,560
By the way, Yuki's not my kid.

386
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:24,970
Every time I did it with your mom,
I used a condom. Bye, then.

387
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,140
Bye, then.

388
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,070
Thanks for this.

389
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:32,150
Bye.

390
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:42,990
Oh no, I'm hopeless.

391
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:47,290
Gotta get it in.

392
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,860
So cold...

393
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:09,450
I spent 674 yen
at the supermarket.

394
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:13,150
I have 650 yen left in my wallet.

395
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:16,620
How many yen were in my wallet
to begin with?

396
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:29,740
Soon, I came across Bubu the Pig,
planting turnip seeds in a field.

397
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,570
What a nice bag you have there.

398
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,510
My mother made it for me.

399
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:46,620
Where, where, where is it?

400
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:01,970
You can't go out, Shigeru.

401
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:03,800
I'm not out.

402
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,200
I'm not out.

403
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:11,870
I'm home!

404
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:14,040
Welcome home.

405
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:17,250
How've you guys been?

406
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,490
Hey, how've you guys been?

407
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:23,530
See, I'm home.

408
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:27,220
Look, presents.
This one's for Yuki.

409
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:28,930
Thank you.

410
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:31,230
For you, Shigeru.

411
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:35,600
I'm home.

412
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:38,840
Akira, Akira.

413
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:44,870
Wow, it's been a while.

414
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,450
Shall I open it for you?

415
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:52,850
You can carry it on your back.

416
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:54,950
Wow!

417
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:55,990
It's cute.

418
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,500
Carry it? Carry it?
Like a backpack.

419
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:03,630
You can put your things inside,
and do that...

420
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:08,500
The sides? Your ears? Out?

421
00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:10,340
Ears out?

422
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:17,870
You look so neat.
He looks better with short hair.

423
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:20,810
Which is more becoming, Yuki?
Long or...

424
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:21,680
Long.

425
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:26,320
You like him better with long hair?
Oh, no, but I'll cut it anyway.

426
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:28,650
A little bit shorter's okay, right?

427
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:35,560
What's that face for?

428
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:40,170
Don't tell me
I cut your bangs too short.

429
00:44:40,270 --> 00:44:43,070
You're fine, right?
Too short?

430
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,970
I don't believe it.

431
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:50,310
Anyway, it'll grow right back out.
Don't act so cool.

432
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:51,940
You look cute.

433
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:53,950
I mean it.

434
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:56,950
Here goes!

435
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:03,550
Maribo!

436
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,300
A chop! The pits!

437
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,600
Chop Maribo!

438
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:14,710
Maribo!

439
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:18,700
Maribo!

440
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:53,010
Hey, what are you doing?
Kyoko.

441
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:59,050
What are you doing?
Don't touch my things.

442
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:04,950
It's your fault.
It won't come out...

443
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:08,560
Where were you, really, Mother?

444
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:12,590
I told you I was working.

445
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,500
A whole month?

446
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:18,760
I was in Osaka.
It was just too far.

447
00:46:20,370 --> 00:46:23,400
I told you not to touch my things.

448
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:08,880
What are you doing?

449
00:47:08,990 --> 00:47:12,950
What? You see, today,

450
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:16,550
your mother has to step out,
so I'm getting ready.

451
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:18,100
You're going already?

452
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:22,160
Your mother's... busy today.

453
00:47:23,170 --> 00:47:26,700
But listen,
I'll be back for Christmas.

454
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:37,210
Only 5,000 yen?

455
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:43,050
He could've lent you a little more.
I mean, you're little kids in a jam.

456
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:46,020
But hey, pachinko parlors and taxis,

457
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:49,250
I don't draw customers
in such hard times.

458
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:55,160
But you go back to him
if you need to.

459
00:47:56,470 --> 00:47:58,200
It's cold.

460
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:03,270
And the wind's blowing so hard.
It's so cold...

461
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:08,980
Did you tell the man you're seeing
about us?

462
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:20,480
I told you, I'll tell him eventually...

463
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,680
Sugar.

464
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:46,740
You've got sugar there.

465
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:53,320
God, you're irritating.

466
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:58,690
Listen, I keep asking you,

467
00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:02,130
when will you let us go to school?

468
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:06,070
What's this "school this, school that"?
Who needs to go to school anyway?

469
00:49:06,170 --> 00:49:10,200
Plenty of famous people never
even went to school in the first place.

470
00:49:10,310 --> 00:49:11,500
Like who?

471
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:17,250
How should I know?
But plenty of them...

472
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,680
You're so selfish, Mother.

473
00:49:22,390 --> 00:49:24,290
How can you say that?

474
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:28,690
Selfish? You want to know
who's really selfish?

475
00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:32,290
Your father's the one who's selfish,
up and disappearing like that.

476
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:37,960
What is this?
I'm not allowed to be happy?

477
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:40,600
What is this?

478
00:50:00,290 --> 00:50:02,490
Oh, I know someone famous.

479
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:08,660
Prime Minister Tanaka.
Ever heard of him?

480
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:10,890
Never.

481
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,370
You're too young.

482
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:17,170
How about...
the wrestler Antonio Inoki?

483
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:20,700
I bet he never went to school.
I'm not sure, but...

484
00:50:20,810 --> 00:50:22,210
Sure, he did.

485
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:26,180
Man, you're a drag.
Hurry up and finish eating.

486
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:39,920
I'll send you money soon.

487
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:41,830
You'll come home for Christmas?

488
00:50:41,930 --> 00:50:43,400
Sure, I'll come home.

489
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:47,500
I'll be right home.
You take care of them, too.

490
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,890
Is Totoro really real?

491
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:13,180
Don't you know how big Totoro is?

492
00:52:13,290 --> 00:52:14,380
I know.

493
00:52:14,490 --> 00:52:16,020
I know, he's really big.

494
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:20,390
It'd be a real mess if
he was walking around.

495
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:23,470
The police would've caught him.

496
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,110
Think there are UFOs?

497
00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:29,100
Nope.

498
00:52:29,210 --> 00:52:29,970
Nope.

499
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,870
If Martians exist, so do UFOs.

500
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:36,540
Martians are...

501
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:40,140
What about real zombies?
Scary zombies.

502
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:42,720
You think Santa Claus is real?

503
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:46,720
He is, he is.

504
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:52,560
You think?
There's only one Santa, right?

505
00:52:52,730 --> 00:52:56,360
He can't cover Japan
all by himself, can he?

506
00:52:56,770 --> 00:53:00,900
But he can.
Santa Claus can manage it.

507
00:53:01,010 --> 00:53:02,970
That's right, there are all kinds...

508
00:54:48,450 --> 00:54:50,810
Mother didn't come back, did she?

509
00:54:52,050 --> 00:54:54,210
Her work kept her away longer.

510
00:54:57,190 --> 00:54:59,320
Because I was so mean to Mom?

511
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:01,020
No, that's not true.

512
00:55:41,170 --> 00:55:44,360
Hello, this is the
Sanwa Department Store.

513
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,530
May I speak to Fukushima Keiko
in menswear?

514
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:48,970
Excuse me...

515
00:55:49,110 --> 00:55:50,300
This is her son.

516
00:55:50,410 --> 00:55:52,310
Please hold a moment.

517
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:06,720
I'm terribly sorry, but Ms. Fukushima
resigned last month.

518
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:08,820
How may I help you?

519
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,150
How many minutes, Shigeru?

520
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:34,580
Not yet.

521
00:56:36,050 --> 00:56:38,780
Not yet... how many more minutes?

522
00:56:38,890 --> 00:56:40,290
One more minute, maybe.

523
00:56:40,390 --> 00:56:41,550
Maybe?

524
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:43,130
Maybe?

525
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:48,590
Not ready yet?

526
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:59,310
It's about ready, I think.

527
00:56:59,410 --> 00:57:00,610
You think?

528
00:57:01,610 --> 00:57:02,880
Let's eat. Then.

529
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:05,910
Thanks for the food.

530
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:07,990
Off you go, then.

531
00:57:08,390 --> 00:57:09,850
Thanks for the food.

532
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:15,690
I have to lick the lid.

533
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:29,730
Taste good?

534
00:57:30,070 --> 00:57:31,300
Tastes good.

535
00:57:31,410 --> 00:57:33,270
The super-duper best.

536
00:58:15,350 --> 00:58:18,480
Excuse me, I'm looking
for a phone number.

537
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:22,920
Kanagawa Prefecture,
Kawasaki City, Nakahara-Ku...

538
00:58:40,310 --> 00:58:42,300
Hello, this is the Yamamotos.

539
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:47,340
Hello... Hello?

540
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:52,650
Wonder who this is.
They aren't talking...

541
00:59:03,270 --> 00:59:06,760
Good evening.
Have a happy new year.

542
01:00:08,630 --> 01:00:10,070
Kyoko's next.

543
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:14,270
With the "kyo" like in Tokyo.

544
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:27,780
Akira.

545
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:35,550
That's right...

546
01:00:36,130 --> 01:00:38,530
Mom sent us all
New Year's presents.

547
01:00:39,530 --> 01:00:40,860
Look.

548
01:00:41,370 --> 01:00:42,630
For you, Yuki.

549
01:00:42,770 --> 01:00:43,830
Thank you.

550
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:44,990
Shigeru.

551
01:00:45,470 --> 01:00:46,660
Kyoko.

552
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:50,360
That's for you.

553
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:51,770
Thanks.

554
01:00:53,010 --> 01:00:54,500
4,000 yen!

555
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:59,910
4,000 yen! No way.
It's 2,000 yen.

556
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:02,250
1,000 yen.

557
01:01:03,890 --> 01:01:05,250
4,000 yen.

558
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:08,160
4,000 yen.

559
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:11,260
What do you want, Yuki?

560
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:12,800
A doll.

561
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:14,900
Shigeru?

562
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,260
Rollerblades.

563
01:01:16,370 --> 01:01:17,730
Rollerblades?

564
01:01:21,710 --> 01:01:23,040
You, Kyoko?

565
01:01:23,140 --> 01:01:25,440
I'm saving mine up for a piano.

566
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:27,740
You, brother?

567
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:30,310
A baseball glove.

568
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:05,010
No, I'm gonna meet
Mommy at the station.

569
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:07,620
She's not coming home today.

570
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:10,020
I'm sure she's coming home.

571
01:02:10,990 --> 01:02:13,180
She'll be back next week.

572
01:02:13,590 --> 01:02:15,820
She's really coming next week?

573
01:02:15,930 --> 01:02:17,360
She really will.

574
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:18,820
How do you know?

575
01:02:18,930 --> 01:02:20,160
I just do.

576
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:27,730
She's coming home next week.

577
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:35,270
It's Yuki's birthday today.

578
01:03:07,110 --> 01:03:08,140
These?

579
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:13,250
These?

580
01:03:13,350 --> 01:03:14,340
Yeah.

581
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:31,400
Just hang on.

582
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:39,240
Okay, let's go.

583
01:03:52,890 --> 01:03:54,380
Good evening.

584
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:55,520
Good evening.

585
01:03:55,630 --> 01:03:56,990
Stepping out?

586
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:58,660
Where to?

587
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:00,890
To the station to meet my mommy.

588
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,730
I see, what's your name?

589
01:04:04,170 --> 01:04:04,900
Yuki.

590
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,940
Yuki, I see.
How old are you, Yuki?

591
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:08,900
I'm 5.

592
01:04:09,010 --> 01:04:11,000
5 years old? I see.

593
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:14,370
She's our cousin,
just staying overnight.

594
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:16,840
Oh, I see...
Off you go, then.

595
01:04:16,950 --> 01:04:18,350
Off we go, then.

596
01:04:20,990 --> 01:04:22,150
Adorable little girl.

597
01:04:23,650 --> 01:04:28,180
Tomato, daikon, broccoli,
squash, carrot...

598
01:04:28,290 --> 01:04:29,320
There's so many.

599
01:04:36,930 --> 01:04:40,340
Plates...
Cups...

600
01:04:42,510 --> 01:04:44,440
The butcher's...

601
01:05:13,470 --> 01:05:16,570
Oh, only one left?

602
01:05:20,780 --> 01:05:22,640
The last one.

603
01:06:10,090 --> 01:06:11,490
There's the monorail.

604
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:07,980
It goes to Haneda Airport.

605
01:07:09,990 --> 01:07:14,290
Someday let's get on
and go see the airplanes.

606
01:07:16,390 --> 01:07:19,730
Yeah, let's do that.

607
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:52,690
<i>Dear Kyoko</i>

608
01:08:52,860 --> 01:08:57,560
<i>To Kyoko</i>

609
01:11:15,970 --> 01:11:18,800
No, no, it turns on
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, idiot.

610
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:20,840
No, no, it's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

611
01:11:20,940 --> 01:11:22,770
No. I swear it's on 5.

612
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:25,540
No, I swear it's 6.

613
01:11:25,650 --> 01:11:27,610
Listen, listen, man.

614
01:11:27,710 --> 01:11:31,050
You couldn't even do it on
that Kamehameha thing.

615
01:11:31,350 --> 01:11:33,050
Yes I could.

616
01:11:33,990 --> 01:11:36,750
Go! No, that's too far-ish.

617
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:38,720
Oh damn, you did it.

618
01:11:40,030 --> 01:11:42,620
You're a genius, man.

619
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:44,690
Using the brake?

620
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:45,760
No brake.

621
01:11:47,070 --> 01:11:48,730
Hey, wow, cool.

622
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:52,070
You gotta crash it.

623
01:11:54,540 --> 01:11:58,030
That one already burned...

624
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:02,810
Welcome.

625
01:12:08,690 --> 01:12:09,920
Your friends?

626
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:13,020
Yeah, friends.

627
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:17,360
That's 197 yen.

628
01:12:24,070 --> 01:12:25,330
Get off, get off.

629
01:13:02,610 --> 01:13:03,770
Thanks.

630
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:05,130
Let's go.

631
01:13:05,780 --> 01:13:06,710
Bye, then.

632
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:10,510
Thank you.

633
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:14,350
See you tomorrow.
Bye, then.

634
01:13:19,790 --> 01:13:22,120
<i>Please indicate the desired amount.</i>

635
01:13:27,430 --> 01:13:29,800
<i>Please indicate the desired amount.</i>

636
01:13:57,660 --> 01:14:00,000
- Excuse us.
- Excuse us.

637
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:08,330
This one, huh?
Let's do it, let's do it.

638
01:14:09,180 --> 01:14:12,700
<i>Are you ready?
Start!</i>

639
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:19,850
All right, perfect, max.

640
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:22,280
What!

641
01:14:25,290 --> 01:14:26,490
Take that!

642
01:14:26,590 --> 01:14:28,580
What a weird haircut.

643
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,120
Coke and what?

644
01:14:32,230 --> 01:14:35,360
Coke and orange and...
CC Lemon.

645
01:14:43,380 --> 01:14:44,360
I'm home.

646
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:45,240
We bought stuff.

647
01:14:45,340 --> 01:14:46,170
You're late.

648
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:48,300
How far'd you go?

649
01:14:49,350 --> 01:14:50,180
Coke for me.

650
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:51,310
Me too.

651
01:14:53,820 --> 01:14:56,290
Hey, somebody attacked.

652
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:59,450
Hey, you jerk, you let 'em in.

653
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:01,530
But this person attacked.

654
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:05,960
<i>Your Gas Bill is Overdue</i>

655
01:15:06,670 --> 01:15:08,960
Get away, you jerk.

656
01:15:13,910 --> 01:15:16,530
Okay, nice.

657
01:15:21,810 --> 01:15:22,680
Go away.

658
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:37,120
Told you so, dammit.

659
01:15:38,830 --> 01:15:41,270
You'll never get it that way.

660
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:42,990
Butt out.

661
01:15:58,220 --> 01:15:59,310
Let's go to the store, Akira.

662
01:15:59,420 --> 01:16:01,390
I'm hungry, treat us.

663
01:16:01,490 --> 01:16:02,610
Sure.

664
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:04,410
Hey, I wanna go, too.

665
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:06,890
No, you stay home.
Don't touch the game.

666
01:16:07,030 --> 01:16:08,050
Don't touch it.

667
01:16:20,310 --> 01:16:21,600
What are you doing?

668
01:16:53,740 --> 01:16:57,040
Hey, hey hey, isn't this great?

669
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:01,870
Her tits are huge.
Great, huh?

670
01:17:02,780 --> 01:17:05,650
Isn't it great?

671
01:17:21,990 --> 01:17:23,430
You swipe it?

672
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:26,920
Your turn, Akira.

673
01:17:31,370 --> 01:17:34,000
We're friends, right? Go.

674
01:17:37,340 --> 01:17:38,470
Let's go.

675
01:17:49,550 --> 01:17:50,850
Hey, wait.

676
01:19:40,730 --> 01:19:42,360
He's not your type?

677
01:19:42,470 --> 01:19:46,270
No way! He's way too passionate.
I like a cool guy.

678
01:19:46,570 --> 01:19:48,730
But that's what's so cool.

679
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:49,860
Been a while.

680
01:19:49,970 --> 01:19:50,870
Been a while.

681
01:19:50,970 --> 01:19:52,030
How you been?

682
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:55,740
Yeah, fine.

683
01:19:57,380 --> 01:20:00,710
They're too big for me.
They don't fit.

684
01:20:01,050 --> 01:20:05,320
Mom says I'll grow anyway,
so take the big ones.

685
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:06,990
I hate 'em.

686
01:20:07,660 --> 01:20:08,650
Hey.

687
01:20:11,060 --> 01:20:14,430
Been a while.
How you been? What's up?

688
01:20:15,930 --> 01:20:19,230
Bought a new game,
why don't you come over?

689
01:20:23,810 --> 01:20:26,370
I'll come over
when I have time.

690
01:20:28,450 --> 01:20:29,380
See you 'round.

691
01:20:31,210 --> 01:20:34,150
I've got cram school, sorry.

692
01:20:34,890 --> 01:20:35,850
See ya.

693
01:20:35,950 --> 01:20:37,680
See ya, then.

694
01:20:40,660 --> 01:20:41,990
Who was that?

695
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:46,350
Take me along to play.

696
01:20:46,860 --> 01:20:48,630
Yeah, but his house stinks.

697
01:20:48,730 --> 01:20:51,430
No way, stinks of what?

698
01:20:52,070 --> 01:20:55,530
Stinks of garbage.
The place is a real mess.

699
01:20:55,640 --> 01:20:56,700
Like rotting?

700
01:21:00,610 --> 01:21:01,700
Here she comes.

701
01:21:55,300 --> 01:22:00,290
<i>To Mizuguchi Saki in Heaven</i>

702
01:22:21,430 --> 01:22:22,860
Got it.

703
01:22:45,350 --> 01:22:48,980
Hello there, Fukushima-san.

704
01:23:43,710 --> 01:23:45,570
Don't worry, he's gone.

705
01:23:58,390 --> 01:23:59,720
How old are you?

706
01:23:59,820 --> 01:24:01,120
I'm 12.

707
01:24:01,860 --> 01:24:05,850
You can't start working part-time
until you're 16.

708
01:24:08,830 --> 01:24:13,240
Shouldn't you contact the police
or child welfare, or something?

709
01:24:15,110 --> 01:24:18,370
If I do, the four of us won't
be able to stay together.

710
01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:22,770
That happened before
and it was an awful mess.

711
01:24:23,510 --> 01:24:24,980
I see...

712
01:25:08,390 --> 01:25:10,020
You need it for your piano.
It's okay.

713
01:26:56,930 --> 01:26:58,260
Let's race.

714
01:27:06,510 --> 01:27:08,670
Don't beat me, Akira.

715
01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:43,110
Welcome.

716
01:27:49,790 --> 01:27:51,650
Did your mother come back?

717
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:03,430
Who's taller?
We're the same.

718
01:28:55,390 --> 01:28:57,380
There are seeds here, too.

719
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:00,110
Take them.

720
01:29:00,590 --> 01:29:02,110
I'll take these, too.

721
01:29:02,230 --> 01:29:06,590
Okay, I'll take these.
Look, Akira, seeds.

722
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:11,060
Somebody just left them behind.

723
01:29:11,730 --> 01:29:13,460
Poor things.

724
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:22,210
2, 3, 4, 5...

725
01:29:22,310 --> 01:29:24,440
Amazing, for real.

726
01:29:25,010 --> 01:29:26,780
Paper, scissors, rock.

727
01:29:29,490 --> 01:29:33,050
First is rock.
Paper, scissors, rock.

728
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:36,320
I can't stop.

729
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:56,540
Akira, got dirt?

730
01:29:56,850 --> 01:29:57,940
Got it.

731
01:30:07,660 --> 01:30:08,750
Shige!

732
01:30:53,240 --> 01:30:54,430
Shigeru!

733
01:30:56,240 --> 01:30:57,500
Shigeru.

734
01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:00,940
Hey, Shigeru.

735
01:31:01,240 --> 01:31:02,370
The bag.

736
01:31:24,570 --> 01:31:27,000
It came out funny.

737
01:31:33,640 --> 01:31:34,740
Yu...

738
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:41,140
ki...

739
01:31:46,420 --> 01:31:48,450
I'll go get some water.

740
01:32:07,810 --> 01:32:10,680
Brother, the lights don't work.

741
01:32:28,460 --> 01:32:30,300
Not in the bathroom, either.

742
01:33:54,020 --> 01:33:57,280
Mr. String, Mr. String,
where are you?

743
01:34:29,190 --> 01:34:30,850
What are you doing?

744
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:35,590
Not going to school?

745
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:36,850
No...

746
01:34:37,460 --> 01:34:39,260
I'm not either.

747
01:34:50,910 --> 01:34:54,310
There's a cicada hole here,
did you know?

748
01:34:54,540 --> 01:34:56,010
No, I didn't.

749
01:35:00,380 --> 01:35:02,280
And again.

750
01:35:04,790 --> 01:35:07,920
Pi-ne-ap-p-l-e.

751
01:35:09,860 --> 01:35:13,090
First is rock.
Paper, scissors, rock.

752
01:35:17,630 --> 01:35:21,360
Ch-o-co-la-t-e.

753
01:35:21,470 --> 01:35:24,600
First is rock.
Paper, scissors, rock.

754
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:27,200
And again!

755
01:36:22,760 --> 01:36:26,760
<i>We have suspended
your water service</i>

756
01:38:24,920 --> 01:38:27,390
I got so many.

757
01:38:27,490 --> 01:38:28,790
Wow, amazing.

758
01:38:47,980 --> 01:38:49,440
What are you doing?

759
01:38:50,380 --> 01:38:51,970
Nothing special.

760
01:38:53,950 --> 01:38:55,920
Did you catch cold?

761
01:38:57,390 --> 01:38:58,880
Your voice sounds weird.

762
01:38:59,190 --> 01:39:00,750
Shut up.

763
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:23,610
Are you washing your hair?

764
01:39:25,010 --> 01:39:26,680
Yesterday, at the park.

765
01:39:50,310 --> 01:39:51,670
Nice and cool?

766
01:40:04,650 --> 01:40:06,520
When's your mother coming back?

767
01:40:07,320 --> 01:40:08,880
She's never coming back.

768
01:40:13,260 --> 01:40:14,350
Probably.

769
01:41:27,100 --> 01:41:30,270
I'm not hot.
I'm hot.

770
01:41:34,150 --> 01:41:36,480
I said, I'm not hot, I'm not.

771
01:41:39,180 --> 01:41:40,580
Thank you.

772
01:42:09,880 --> 01:42:11,780
Eat the inari sushi first.

773
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:20,920
Shigeru.

774
01:42:25,530 --> 01:42:26,860
No salmon?

775
01:42:26,960 --> 01:42:29,300
No, just what's there.

776
01:42:50,390 --> 01:42:53,410
This was Shigeru's.
It died.

777
01:43:13,780 --> 01:43:15,210
She fell asleep.

778
01:43:29,290 --> 01:43:33,290
Excuse me. The door was unlocked...

779
01:43:36,130 --> 01:43:39,330
I'm the landlord from the 3rd floor,
here about the rent.

780
01:43:40,370 --> 01:43:41,960
Where's your mother?

781
01:43:42,910 --> 01:43:46,070
She's working in Osaka.

782
01:43:49,150 --> 01:43:51,410
Are you cousins?

783
01:44:29,190 --> 01:44:30,810
I'll go make some money.

784
01:44:30,920 --> 01:44:32,790
What? How?

785
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:39,210
Here!

786
01:45:39,320 --> 01:45:40,220
No.

787
01:45:40,720 --> 01:45:43,630
Why not?
Just sang karaoke with him.

788
01:45:43,930 --> 01:45:45,020
No!

789
01:47:21,530 --> 01:47:23,020
What are you eating?

790
01:47:24,360 --> 01:47:25,590
Spit it out.

791
01:47:30,200 --> 01:47:31,630
What is that?

792
01:47:34,510 --> 01:47:35,870
Paper.

793
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:50,150
That's 287 yen.

794
01:47:56,390 --> 01:47:58,220
Exactly, thank you.

795
01:48:00,700 --> 01:48:02,600
How'd the semester go?

796
01:48:02,700 --> 01:48:06,800
His report card, you mean?
A total disaster.

797
01:48:06,900 --> 01:48:10,810
He got a terrible grade in Japanese.

798
01:48:10,910 --> 01:48:13,170
My child did badly, too.

799
01:48:34,870 --> 01:48:36,730
Wish I could find something.

800
01:49:05,060 --> 01:49:06,530
Hey, where's Shigeru?

801
01:49:07,460 --> 01:49:08,830
Dunno.

802
01:49:18,480 --> 01:49:20,200
What are you doing?

803
01:49:20,980 --> 01:49:22,310
Where's Shigeru?

804
01:49:22,410 --> 01:49:23,640
Dunno.

805
01:49:58,120 --> 01:49:59,170
Shige!

806
01:50:01,520 --> 01:50:04,350
You said you wanted noodles
so I got some!

807
01:50:04,450 --> 01:50:05,610
What do you want!

808
01:50:06,190 --> 01:50:07,820
You watch it, buster.

809
01:50:09,190 --> 01:50:10,630
Don't bother coming home.

810
01:50:10,730 --> 01:50:12,630
Don't take it out on things.

811
01:50:21,370 --> 01:50:22,570
Did it break?

812
01:50:25,040 --> 01:50:26,440
Amazing power.

813
01:50:26,540 --> 01:50:28,640
He's just an idiot.

814
01:52:49,690 --> 01:52:51,380
Cut it out, Yuki.

815
01:52:52,360 --> 01:52:54,450
I have to pee.

816
01:52:55,260 --> 01:52:57,990
Why didn't you pee
in the park, before?

817
01:52:59,360 --> 01:53:00,890
Go pee by the bath.

818
01:53:01,870 --> 01:53:03,030
Don't want to.

819
01:53:11,040 --> 01:53:13,410
Is Saki coming back?

820
01:53:32,660 --> 01:53:36,030
Shigeru! You can't just
use up all the water!

821
01:53:37,070 --> 01:53:39,040
There's none left to drink.

822
01:53:45,940 --> 01:53:48,040
Is Saki coming to play again?

823
01:53:48,150 --> 01:53:49,200
Never.

824
01:54:11,670 --> 01:54:13,030
What are you doing?

825
01:54:14,440 --> 01:54:16,000
I'm selling these.

826
01:54:18,580 --> 01:54:19,910
Don't need 'em anymore.

827
01:54:20,910 --> 01:54:22,170
Stop it.

828
01:54:22,280 --> 01:54:23,250
Cut it out.

829
01:54:23,350 --> 01:54:24,710
Let go!

830
01:54:24,820 --> 01:54:25,800
Shut up!

831
01:54:26,220 --> 01:54:27,580
Move.

832
01:54:28,790 --> 01:54:30,310
Don't touch it!

833
01:54:36,590 --> 01:54:38,320
She's never coming back.

834
01:54:42,600 --> 01:54:46,260
Who cares! Stay in there!
Idiot!

835
01:55:29,110 --> 01:55:33,380
Miyauchi!
Don't move your legs too much!

836
01:55:43,690 --> 01:55:47,420
Kato! Where's Yano today?

837
01:55:47,530 --> 01:55:48,790
Cram school.

838
01:55:48,900 --> 01:55:53,030
Cram school?
Oh, man, we're short.

839
01:56:07,650 --> 01:56:09,550
What year are you?

840
01:56:15,960 --> 01:56:17,620
Akira, #9, right field.

841
01:56:23,970 --> 01:56:25,230
Line up!

842
01:56:33,610 --> 01:56:38,380
We're starting a game between the
White Bears and the Kenzan Fighters.

843
01:56:38,650 --> 01:56:40,120
Let's go!

844
01:56:40,420 --> 01:56:41,350
Bow.

845
01:56:41,450 --> 01:56:43,010
Let's go!

846
01:57:26,400 --> 01:57:31,130
Akira, hold your hands closer,
like this...

847
01:57:31,530 --> 01:57:35,870
When the ball comes,
take a real hard slice at it, wham.

848
01:57:35,970 --> 01:57:37,940
Just, wham, swing at it.

849
01:57:46,650 --> 01:57:48,810
That's fine, nice swing...

850
01:57:48,920 --> 01:57:54,220
"A big, big,
homerun, homerun."

851
01:57:54,320 --> 01:57:57,380
"In heaven...
Grandpa and grandma..."

852
01:59:04,030 --> 01:59:05,220
Yuki.

853
01:59:06,260 --> 01:59:07,660
Yuki won't get up.

854
01:59:10,030 --> 01:59:11,230
Yuki!

855
01:59:14,240 --> 01:59:16,000
She fell off the chair.

856
01:59:25,950 --> 01:59:27,140
Yes, hello?

857
01:59:27,250 --> 01:59:29,180
Is Fukushima Keiko there?

858
01:59:29,520 --> 01:59:31,850
Just a minute.
I'll go get her.

859
02:00:44,260 --> 02:00:47,750
<i>Mommy</i>

860
02:01:42,090 --> 02:01:46,550
A big, big...

861
02:01:47,560 --> 02:01:49,860
homerun...

862
02:01:50,760 --> 02:01:55,700
In heaven...
Grandpa and grandma.

863
02:01:56,730 --> 02:01:58,530
So surprised...

864
02:02:00,470 --> 02:02:05,340
A big... homerun...
In heaven...

865
02:02:06,240 --> 02:02:07,440
Akira.

866
02:02:38,710 --> 02:02:40,010
What happened?

867
02:02:49,450 --> 02:02:52,180
That money...
Can I borrow it?

868
02:02:54,960 --> 02:02:58,190
I want to show Yuki...
the airplanes.

869
02:03:10,710 --> 02:03:15,240
You all off for a picnic?
Looks like fun.

870
02:03:16,280 --> 02:03:18,910
That'll be 1,895 yen.

871
02:03:22,250 --> 02:03:23,910
Okay, thanks.

872
02:03:55,320 --> 02:03:57,150
Kyoko, what's this?

873
02:03:58,050 --> 02:03:59,720
It just arrived.

874
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:19,170
<i>To Akira: give them my best.
I'm counting on you. --Mother</i>

875
02:04:49,610 --> 02:04:50,770
She doesn't fit.

876
02:04:53,610 --> 02:04:56,770
Guess Yuki... grew.

877
02:06:12,190 --> 02:06:13,920
Is it good bye?

878
02:10:54,270 --> 02:10:56,830
When I touched Yuki
this morning...

879
02:10:59,070 --> 02:11:01,740
she was so cold, it was awful.

880
02:11:08,280 --> 02:11:10,250
It just felt so...

881
02:11:13,720 --> 02:11:16,190
It was just so...

882
02:12:42,540 --> 02:12:48,070
<i>When I ask the midnight sky</i>

883
02:12:50,520 --> 02:12:56,190
<i>the stars just shine</i>

884
02:12:58,290 --> 02:13:04,260
<i>Into the black lake of my
molten heart</i>

885
02:13:06,070 --> 02:13:11,470
<i>I can only flow</i>

886
02:13:13,910 --> 02:13:19,540
<i>Will the angel even give me
a backward glance?</i>

887
02:13:21,480 --> 02:13:27,080
<i>Want to splash around in my heart?</i>

888
02:13:29,090 --> 02:13:34,590
<i>The winds of the coming winter
lap at the waves</i>

889
02:13:36,830 --> 02:13:42,430
<i>calling me into the dark</i>

890
02:13:44,170 --> 02:13:51,510
<i>With eyes as wilted as ice</i>

891
02:13:51,610 --> 02:13:58,780
<i>I'm growing up</i>

892
02:13:59,050 --> 02:14:06,120
<i>A jewel pungent with a stench</i>

893
02:14:06,530 --> 02:14:14,300
<i>that brooks no one's approach.</i>

894
02:15:10,030 --> 02:15:11,150
