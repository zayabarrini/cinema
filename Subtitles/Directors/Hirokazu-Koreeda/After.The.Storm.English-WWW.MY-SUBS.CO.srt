1
00:00:25,331 --> 00:00:28,801
<i>Now for a report on the latest typhoon.</i>

2
00:00:28,901 --> 00:00:30,312
<i>Yes, please.</i>

3
00:00:30,402 --> 00:00:33,611
<i>The powerful typhoon, Number 23, is...</i>

4
00:00:33,672 --> 00:00:35,515
Number 23?

5
00:00:37,276 --> 00:00:40,257
That's way too many typhoons for one year.

6
00:00:41,313 --> 00:00:45,989
I remember her name now.
Janet. Janet Lynn.

7
00:00:47,153 --> 00:00:49,690
The blonde. With hair like this.

8
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:53,032
She fell on her butt.
But she got a perfect score.

9
00:00:53,526 --> 00:00:55,972
“Figia” skating makes no sense.

10
00:00:56,428 --> 00:00:59,136
- It's pronounced “figure.”
- “Gure”?

11
00:01:00,266 --> 00:01:02,268
“Figure.”

12
00:01:02,668 --> 00:01:05,979
This Mr. Yanagida, did he work with Dad?

13
00:01:06,372 --> 00:01:08,784
He was his boss at the factory.

14
00:01:09,542 --> 00:01:14,150
Your father used to borrow money from him
all the time...

15
00:01:14,947 --> 00:01:18,986
and I'd have to beg my big brother
for help.

16
00:01:19,051 --> 00:01:22,396
Well, thank goodness those days are over.

17
00:01:23,155 --> 00:01:24,862
It was always up to me.

18
00:01:25,357 --> 00:01:27,997
Sounds like you miss arguing with him.

19
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,370
Not at all.

20
00:01:30,462 --> 00:01:33,170
I feel so liberated.

21
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:38,543
You'll go senile being alone all the time.
Go out and make friends.

22
00:01:38,637 --> 00:01:42,642
New friends at my age
only mean more funerals.

23
00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:43,709
Right.

24
00:01:48,314 --> 00:01:51,227
The flavor sinks into the ingredients

25
00:01:51,317 --> 00:01:54,594
if you cool it down slowly
and let it sit overnight.

26
00:01:54,687 --> 00:01:56,496
Just like people.

27
00:01:56,555 --> 00:01:58,501
Nicely put.

28
00:01:58,991 --> 00:02:01,733
I'll put some in Minori's lunch box
tomorrow.

29
00:02:01,827 --> 00:02:03,397
What about dinner tonight?

30
00:02:03,495 --> 00:02:05,736
I Still have that leftover chicken.

31
00:02:06,065 --> 00:02:08,238
That's not enough.

32
00:02:08,334 --> 00:02:10,575
Your husband's still young.

33
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:15,013
Young? He's turning 50 this year.

34
00:02:15,374 --> 00:02:19,288
But he needs to sit a little longer
before his flavor sinks in.

35
00:02:21,614 --> 00:02:26,120
Look at that word.
It looks like it has slumped shoulders.

36
00:02:26,218 --> 00:02:30,098
I've always had bad handwriting.
I took after you.

37
00:02:30,189 --> 00:02:33,102
I'm not as bad as you.

38
00:02:33,192 --> 00:02:36,230
In that case, you address all these.

39
00:02:36,295 --> 00:02:39,037
But my fingers won't move.

40
00:02:39,098 --> 00:02:41,408
They're moving just fine.

41
00:02:41,467 --> 00:02:45,779
Knock it off. You're not some comedian.

42
00:02:48,073 --> 00:02:51,316
But Dad sure had good handwriting.

43
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:54,391
That was the only thing he was proud of.

44
00:02:55,447 --> 00:02:58,917
Even when everyone started having
their New Year's cards printed...

45
00:02:59,718 --> 00:03:02,096
- he kept grinding his own ink.
- Right.

46
00:03:08,494 --> 00:03:11,065
Hey, did the Shibatas move?

47
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:15,010
Their son bought a house
in that housing development.

48
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,104
Wow! I'm impressed.

49
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:20,446
He was never bright in school.

50
00:03:20,506 --> 00:03:23,783
They say, “Great talents bloom late.”

51
00:03:23,842 --> 00:03:27,153
We have a “great talent”
in our family, too.

52
00:03:27,846 --> 00:03:30,452
His height certainly is great.

Ryota?

00:05:48,554 --> 00:05:51,831
How have you been? What brings you here?

74
00:05:51,924 --> 00:05:56,304
I'm here sorting out stuff
after Dad's funeral.

75
00:05:56,395 --> 00:05:59,342
I heard. My condolences.

76
00:05:59,431 --> 00:06:03,140
Say, didn't you move out?

77
00:06:03,235 --> 00:06:04,578
I moved back home.

78
00:06:04,636 --> 00:06:07,674
An elderly man died all alone last year.

79
00:06:07,773 --> 00:06:10,014
- Really?
- Yes, really.

80
00:06:10,442 --> 00:06:12,115
The one in Apartment 535.

81
00:06:12,778 --> 00:06:14,689
No one knew for three weeks.

82
00:06:16,115 --> 00:06:19,426
That made me worry about my parents.

83
00:06:19,485 --> 00:06:20,930
You're a good daughter.

84
00:06:21,487 --> 00:06:25,594
You're the good son, Ryota.

85
00:06:26,492 --> 00:06:31,441
Yoshimi and I were saying
how you're the star of our class.

86
00:06:31,497 --> 00:06:32,498
No.

87
00:06:32,598 --> 00:06:35,602
Your folks must have been
so proud of your award.

88
00:06:35,667 --> 00:06:36,668
Hardly.

89
00:06:37,269 --> 00:06:41,775
My old man never read a single novel
in his whole life.

90
00:06:43,308 --> 00:06:45,879
Yoshimi, huh? I remember her.

91
00:06:45,978 --> 00:06:47,457
She's gained weight.

92
00:06:49,515 --> 00:06:54,487
<i>A lean, elderly man, 57" rail...</i>

93
00:06:55,787 --> 00:07:01,897

Ryota? Is that you?

101
00:08:26,211 --> 00:08:27,622
Oh, you're home.

102
00:08:28,413 --> 00:08:30,916
You should tell me when you're coming.

103
00:08:32,484 --> 00:08:35,226
- Sorry.
- What now?

104
00:08:38,657 --> 00:08:43,163
I wanted to find something of Dads
to remember him by.

105
00:08:43,595 --> 00:08:44,665
Like what?

106
00:08:44,763 --> 00:08:47,505
Look. I brought your favorite cake.

107
00:08:47,599 --> 00:08:50,808
Do you want money?
You've got powder on your chin.

108
00:08:53,605 --> 00:08:56,984
Say, whatever happened to that scroll?

109
00:08:57,442 --> 00:09:01,083
The one Dad said would be appraised
at three million yen

110
00:09:01,146 --> 00:09:02,784
on that antiques TV show.

111
00:09:02,848 --> 00:09:05,590
We never had that.

112
00:09:06,485 --> 00:09:08,158
Are you in trouble?

113
00:09:08,854 --> 00:09:13,269
No, I'm not. I got a bonus, too.

114
00:09:13,325 --> 00:09:14,497
How much?

115
00:09:14,593 --> 00:09:16,334
Huh? Whatever.

116
00:09:18,764 --> 00:09:21,335
You're a bad liar.

117
00:09:21,767 --> 00:09:23,678
Unlike your father.

118
00:09:28,674 --> 00:09:34,283
Are you sure about that scroll?
It was in a box like this.

119
00:09:34,346 --> 00:09:38,123
I threw away all his things
the day after his funeral.

120
00:09:38,183 --> 00:09:41,062
What? You threw them away?

121
00:09:41,153 --> 00:09:42,689
Yes.

122
00:09:42,788 --> 00:09:44,165
Everything?

123
00:09:44,222 --> 00:09:46,634
They only take up space.

124
00:09:46,692 --> 00:09:49,502
Are you serious?

125
00:09:49,561 --> 00:09:50,562
I am.

126
00:09:50,662 --> 00:09:52,369
I can't believe it.

127
00:09:53,365 --> 00:09:56,005
After 50 years together. Really?

128
00:09:56,068 --> 00:10:01,484
Fifty years together is exactly why.
That's how it is.

129
00:10:01,907 --> 00:10:04,046
- That's deep.
- Yes, it is.

130
00:10:06,311 --> 00:10:08,985
So, there's no Sesshu scroll.

131
00:10:12,084 --> 00:10:13,722
It's so hot today.

132
00:10:14,586 --> 00:10:16,566
Glad I wore short sleeves.

133
00:10:18,857 --> 00:10:23,704
See? I knew I had two of these left.

134
00:10:24,496 --> 00:10:26,498
Forget it. Summer's over.

135
00:10:26,565 --> 00:10:30,069
But it's almost 90 degrees today.

136
00:10:30,168 --> 00:10:32,114
Something's wrong.

137
00:10:32,204 --> 00:10:33,911
It's too frozen to eat.

138
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:38,114
Buy some real ice cream.
You get a pension.

139
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:43,216
When I do, Chinatsu's kids eat it all up.

140
00:10:43,749 --> 00:10:46,855
You can't eat these so fast.

141
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:54,570
So Sis comes here a lot?

142
00:10:54,626 --> 00:10:55,696
Why?

143
00:10:56,094 --> 00:11:00,873
I saw the rice cake on the altar.
Discounted rice cake.

144
00:11:01,433 --> 00:11:04,277
Whenever she wants me
to cook dinner for her.

145
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:07,876
- Be careful.
- Of what?

146
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,451
You never know what she's up to.

147
00:11:11,042 --> 00:11:15,923
There's nothing left around here
to sponge off of.

148
00:11:17,716 --> 00:11:20,322
This has that refrigerator smell.

149
00:11:20,952 --> 00:11:25,059
If you just shave off the top,

150
00:11:25,123 --> 00:11:28,764
you can eat the bottom pan.

151
00:11:32,097 --> 00:11:35,738
Classical music.
Whose influence... Ms. Nagaoka?

152
00:11:36,568 --> 00:11:38,605
What do you care?

153
00:11:39,671 --> 00:11:42,277
You used to love that nasty radio show.

154
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:45,014
That's one thing. This is another.

155
00:11:49,581 --> 00:11:52,187
Get a better radio.
That looks like a robot.

156
00:11:52,284 --> 00:11:55,356
I can take this one into the bath.

157
00:11:55,454 --> 00:11:56,455
Waterproof?

158
00:11:56,521 --> 00:11:59,434
Yes. I mail-ordered it. It's perfect.

159
00:12:14,372 --> 00:12:16,113
Frozen solid.

160
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,285
Too little syrup.

161
00:12:32,991 --> 00:12:34,732
They deliver groceries now?

162
00:12:34,826 --> 00:12:37,363
To residents above the third floor.

163
00:12:38,196 --> 00:12:40,073
That's <i>so</i> convenient.

164
00:12:40,966 --> 00:12:45,073
To compensate
for the inconveniences of old age.

165
00:12:59,084 --> 00:13:01,086
It's so quiet here.

166
00:13:01,653 --> 00:13:04,862
No more children playing these days.

167
00:13:05,724 --> 00:13:09,171
We used to fight over the fields
just to play baseball.

168
00:13:09,728 --> 00:13:12,937
We threw bails onto the balconies
of the girls we liked.

169
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:20,509
Remember this tangerine tree?

170
00:13:22,841 --> 00:13:26,254
That's the one I planted from seeds
when I was in high school.

171
00:13:26,945 --> 00:13:28,515
It's grown so much.

172
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:31,584
It doesn't flower or bear fruit.

173
00:13:31,683 --> 00:13:34,789
But I water it every day like it's you.

174
00:13:36,721 --> 00:13:38,894
That's not a nice thing to say.

175
00:13:38,957 --> 00:13:41,528
But it feeds the caterpillars.

176
00:13:41,593 --> 00:13:47,771
The other day, one of them turned
into a butterfly with a blue pattern.

177
00:13:47,866 --> 00:13:49,868
I'll show you a picture later.

178
00:13:49,935 --> 00:13:51,107
Don't bother.

179
00:13:51,202 --> 00:13:53,546
So it's useful for something.

180
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:58,044
I'm useful for something, too.

181
00:13:58,777 --> 00:13:59,949
In that case...

182
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:04,625
The typhoon's coming,
so please move the pots over to the wall.

183
00:14:05,116 --> 00:14:06,652
Sure thing.

184
00:14:07,085 --> 00:14:08,792
That's easy enough.

185
00:14:10,155 --> 00:14:11,463
Oh, dear.

186
00:14:25,337 --> 00:14:27,476
I definitely took care of that
on Saturday.

187
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:32,581
I'll go back to the bank tomorrow
and ask them.

188
00:14:32,644 --> 00:14:34,282
Knock, knock.

189
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,323
No, I'm not lying. I really...

190
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:40,191
Hello? Hello?

191
00:14:40,285 --> 00:14:41,491
Knock, knock.

192
00:14:42,821 --> 00:14:44,323
Yeah, what?

193
00:14:47,425 --> 00:14:48,426
What is it?

194
00:14:48,493 --> 00:14:50,598
I'll make coffee. Let's eat that cake.

195
00:14:50,662 --> 00:14:51,697
Oh, sure.

196
00:14:51,796 --> 00:14:53,207
What were you doing?

197
00:14:53,298 --> 00:14:54,641
What? Nothing.

198
00:14:54,699 --> 00:14:59,512
Why lock it then? What was the call about?

199
00:15:00,338 --> 00:15:03,547
The new guy at the office is so useless.

200
00:15:03,642 --> 00:15:08,716
It must be tough,
eavesdropping and sneaking into homes.

201
00:15:08,813 --> 00:15:10,486
I saw it on TV.

202
00:15:10,548 --> 00:15:14,018
We're not cops, so it's easy.

203
00:15:14,853 --> 00:15:18,892
Don't risk your life.
You're my only son, after all.

204
00:15:19,524 --> 00:15:21,299
<i>I'll</i> be <i>fine.</i>

205
00:15:21,359 --> 00:15:23,965
I'm just conducting research for my novel.

206
00:15:24,029 --> 00:15:25,667
Fine, then.

207
00:15:27,065 --> 00:15:31,411
But I can't even tell my big brother
what you really do.

208
00:15:31,503 --> 00:15:33,244
I know.

209
00:15:34,372 --> 00:15:35,908
Staying for dinner?

210
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:40,717
I wasn't expecting you,
so I only have noodles.

211
00:15:41,713 --> 00:15:45,354
- I better get going.
- Please don't go.

212
00:15:46,051 --> 00:15:48,497
You sound like you're about to die.

213
00:15:48,553 --> 00:15:50,260
Is it work?

214
00:15:50,355 --> 00:15:53,234
Yeah. I'm in charge, after all.

215
00:16:05,937 --> 00:16:07,382
One for you.

216
00:16:10,909 --> 00:16:12,047
What's that?

217
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:16,081
Spending money.
Buy yourself some classical CD's.

218
00:16:16,548 --> 00:16:21,190
It's okay. I've got my pension.
I get by just fine.

219
00:16:21,252 --> 00:16:25,291
Come on, take it. Let me do this for once.

220
00:16:26,224 --> 00:16:29,262
Are you sure? In that case, I accept.

221
00:16:31,029 --> 00:16:32,804
While you're at it, buy me a condo.

222
00:16:32,897 --> 00:16:35,434
The Shibatas
moved out of their three-bedroom.

223
00:16:35,533 --> 00:16:36,603
Don't push it.

224
00:16:36,701 --> 00:16:38,237
I know you can't afford it.

225
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:42,647
I'm the “great talents bloom late” type.

226
00:16:42,741 --> 00:16:45,153
You're taking too long to bloom.

227
00:16:45,543 --> 00:16:48,888
Hurry up, or I'll haunt you.

228
00:16:48,947 --> 00:16:50,051
Stop it.

229
00:16:50,115 --> 00:16:52,322
- Thai three-bedroom.
- You don't need it.

230
00:17:08,266 --> 00:17:09,677
Thanks for helping.

231
00:17:10,969 --> 00:17:14,576
Climbing up and down four flights of steps
makes me wheeze.

232
00:17:18,343 --> 00:17:19,822
Ru open n.

233
00:17:23,648 --> 00:17:25,787
But today's not the day
for paper recycling.

234
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:28,797
Don't worry. No one's looking.

235
00:17:29,587 --> 00:17:32,363
Yes, they were. They were staring at me.

236
00:17:35,126 --> 00:17:36,537
Professor!

237
00:17:37,195 --> 00:17:38,538
Oh, hello.

238
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:42,043
This is my son, the novelist.

239
00:17:42,133 --> 00:17:44,807
- Oh, yes. Hello.
- How do you do?

240
00:17:44,869 --> 00:17:49,841
This is Professor Niida.
I've been taking classes from him.

241
00:17:49,941 --> 00:17:51,284
Thank you.

242
00:17:51,843 --> 00:17:56,622
<i>I read your book, The Empty House.</i>

243
00:17:56,681 --> 00:17:59,321
<i>- The Empty Table.</i>
- Yes, <i>yes. Table.</i>

244
00:18:00,018 --> 00:18:02,726
Is that based on a true story
from your life?

245
00:18:02,821 --> 00:18:04,664
No, it's fictional.

246
00:18:04,722 --> 00:18:06,895
Oh, I see.

247
00:18:06,991 --> 00:18:11,201
The depiction of the older sister
was so realistic.

248
00:18:11,296 --> 00:18:14,539
And her fights with her mother-in-law.

249
00:18:14,632 --> 00:18:17,841
Thanks. You're too kind.

250
00:18:17,902 --> 00:18:22,749
He always had good grades
in reading and writing.

251
00:18:22,841 --> 00:18:28,257
“Genius is apparent at an early age.”
You have real flair.

252
00:18:31,349 --> 00:18:33,329
See you on Wednesday, then.

253
00:18:34,018 --> 00:18:35,827
We'll cover Beethoven.

254
00:18:35,887 --> 00:18:37,924
Yes, Opus 131.

255
00:18:45,563 --> 00:18:48,237
So that's what that CD was about.

256
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:51,507
It's just a small group.

257
00:18:51,569 --> 00:18:53,446
I'm just preparing for class.

258
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,742
Where does he live?

259
00:18:56,841 --> 00:18:58,218
Number 226.

260
00:18:58,276 --> 00:19:02,418
I figured. One of the upscale condos.

261
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:09,229
What about his family?
He has a wife, right?

262
00:19:09,287 --> 00:19:11,927
Apparently
she passed away three years ago.

263
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:15,036
Why?

264
00:19:15,093 --> 00:19:19,803
There were women's clothes
in the dry cleaning he was carrying.

265
00:19:20,365 --> 00:19:23,039
They must be his daughter's.

266
00:19:24,435 --> 00:19:29,908
You detectives dummies a thing, do you?

267
00:19:29,974 --> 00:19:31,749
No, you're wrong.

268
00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:34,722
The eagle eyes of a novelist.

269
00:19:37,548 --> 00:19:42,463
When I was walking here the other day,
a butterfly kept following me.

270
00:19:43,888 --> 00:19:45,265
The blue one?

271
00:19:45,323 --> 00:19:48,099
I thought ii must be your dad.

272
00:19:48,159 --> 00:19:50,139
I said, “ls that you?”

273
00:19:50,228 --> 00:19:51,673
And ii landed right there.

274
00:19:54,399 --> 00:19:56,572
So I said to him,

275
00:19:56,634 --> 00:20:00,104
“I'm perfectly happy without you,

276
00:20:00,171 --> 00:20:03,482
so don't come for me for a long time.”

277
00:20:03,574 --> 00:20:07,852
And it fluttered away.

278
00:20:07,946 --> 00:20:09,653
I expected a better ending.

279
00:20:09,747 --> 00:20:11,158
Too bad.

280
00:20:13,985 --> 00:20:16,761
Why is the slide in the park
all fenced off?

281
00:20:16,821 --> 00:20:21,463
A child fell off,
and the community board fenced it off.

282
00:20:21,993 --> 00:20:25,463
Isn't that silly?

283
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:29,171
It was the clumsy child's fault.

284
00:20:29,267 --> 00:20:30,473
Right.

285
00:20:31,536 --> 00:20:34,676
Do you get to see Shingo sometimes?

286
00:20:35,139 --> 00:20:38,052
Yeah. He started playing baseball.

287
00:20:38,142 --> 00:20:41,351
Baseball? That boy?

288
00:20:41,446 --> 00:20:45,690
I thought I'd buy him a baseball glove.

289
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:50,026
Is Kyoko well?

290
00:20:50,655 --> 00:20:52,066
She's the same.

291
00:20:53,391 --> 00:20:55,302
Busy with her job.

292
00:20:57,628 --> 00:21:00,040
A woman with her own career.

293
00:21:01,966 --> 00:21:04,708
It doesn't always work.

294
00:21:16,714 --> 00:21:20,526
But it's not broken, is it?
I've been careful with it.

295
00:21:21,552 --> 00:21:24,396
I can offer 3,000 yen. No more.

296
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:27,436
Fine. I'll take that.

297
00:21:30,261 --> 00:21:33,504
Say, aren't you Mr. Shinoda's...

298
00:21:34,665 --> 00:21:36,042
Yes, I'm his son.

299
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,545
I knew it.

300
00:21:37,602 --> 00:21:40,708
Father seems to have been here a lot.

301
00:21:41,339 --> 00:21:43,785
One time, he gave me such a hard time.

302
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:48,847
He said he was desperate for money
to pay for his son's surgery

303
00:21:48,913 --> 00:21:52,258
and brought in a tattered scroll.

304
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:53,522
Surgery'?

305
00:21:53,584 --> 00:21:56,463
Yeah, he said you had a tumor.

306
00:21:56,554 --> 00:21:58,363
I've never been hospitalized.

307
00:21:58,423 --> 00:22:01,632
Right? That's what I figured.

308
00:22:01,726 --> 00:22:03,637
Hey, dear!

309
00:22:03,728 --> 00:22:06,641
That scroll, was it a Sesshu?

310
00:22:06,731 --> 00:22:08,108
Yes, it was.

311
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:10,306
But it was only a print.

312
00:22:10,768 --> 00:22:11,712
A Print?

313
00:22:11,769 --> 00:22:14,249
Only the box was authentic.

314
00:22:14,872 --> 00:22:19,378
He even demanded money
to celebrate your recovery.

315
00:22:19,444 --> 00:22:20,889
He was out of control.

316
00:22:21,946 --> 00:22:23,118
Dear?

317
00:22:23,581 --> 00:22:26,061
I guess she stepped out.

318
00:22:26,818 --> 00:22:29,264
PAWN SHOP

319
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:50,820
We're having so many typhoons this year.

320
00:22:51,442 --> 00:22:52,978
Typhoons?

321
00:22:53,077 --> 00:22:56,081
Yes. There's another one coming.

322
00:23:03,821 --> 00:23:05,459
Sorry. The parking lot was far away.

323
00:23:06,124 --> 00:23:08,798
- I ordered you coffee.
- Thank you.

324
00:23:09,327 --> 00:23:11,500
- Did you already...
- Not yet.

325
00:23:40,525 --> 00:23:45,167
There's never an excuse
for being in a love hotel.

326
00:23:50,168 --> 00:23:55,311
You husband will use this evidence
to get a good divorce settlement...

327
00:23:55,973 --> 00:23:58,510
so he doesn't have to pay you alimony.

328
00:24:00,211 --> 00:24:03,215
What a stingy jerk.

329
00:24:03,981 --> 00:24:05,551
It happens a lot.

330
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:07,220
Your coffee.

331
00:24:13,424 --> 00:24:16,735
Why did my life turn out like this?

332
00:24:21,232 --> 00:24:24,236
But why are you showing me this?

333
00:24:25,336 --> 00:24:29,580
Of course,
we could just deliver ii to our client.

334
00:24:30,508 --> 00:24:31,851
But if you prefer not...

335
00:24:31,909 --> 00:24:33,889
Of course I prefer not.

336
00:24:35,413 --> 00:24:38,394
We could simply
make the evidence disappear.

337
00:24:39,217 --> 00:24:40,890
You can make it disappear?

338
00:24:40,952 --> 00:24:42,226
Yes.

339
00:24:42,286 --> 00:24:44,129
Just between us.

340
00:24:49,927 --> 00:24:51,304
For how much?

341
00:24:52,029 --> 00:24:56,978
We have to deliver something
to our client,

342
00:24:57,068 --> 00:24:59,241
so we'll give him fakes.

343
00:25:00,037 --> 00:25:01,710
Like this.

344
00:25:01,772 --> 00:25:03,877
You were at a planning meeting.

345
00:25:06,644 --> 00:25:09,818
Fine, I'm in. Sounds like fun.

346
00:25:09,914 --> 00:25:11,120
Thank you.

347
00:25:12,617 --> 00:25:15,325
Listen, as long we're here...

348
00:25:16,087 --> 00:25:18,124
can I hire you for another job?

349
00:25:18,723 --> 00:25:19,997
At your service.

350
00:25:21,459 --> 00:25:22,995
For an additional fee.

351
00:25:30,935 --> 00:25:32,937
You didn't deposit the money?

352
00:25:33,004 --> 00:25:35,006
What is this area known for?

353
00:25:35,339 --> 00:25:37,410
No. Not now.

354
00:25:37,475 --> 00:25:40,422
I can't be in this sacred place
and not stop by.

355
00:25:40,478 --> 00:25:43,288
I'm sick of going to loan sharks for you.

356
00:25:43,948 --> 00:25:46,451
I'll double this and pay my rem...

357
00:25:47,118 --> 00:25:49,621
and buy a glove, too, a Mizuno.

358
00:25:49,687 --> 00:25:52,930
Didn't you buy ii
with the cash I lent you?

359
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:55,197
Things happened. I spent it.

360
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,098
What about the scroll?

361
00:25:58,496 --> 00:25:59,839
Wasn't it there?

362
00:26:00,598 --> 00:26:03,044
I wish life were that easy.

363
00:26:03,134 --> 00:26:06,638
I told you it was too good to be true.

364
00:26:07,371 --> 00:26:10,944
<i>They're rounding the fourth rum
and coming down the home stretch.</i>

365
00:26:11,008 --> 00:26:14,683
Hold it, Yoshida! Not yet!

366
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:18,688
- Go now!
- Faster!

367
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:23,997
Make a move!

368
00:26:26,791 --> 00:26:29,203
Catch 'em, you fool!

369
00:26:38,903 --> 00:26:41,008
<i>And it's Suzuki!</i>

370
00:26:43,007 --> 00:26:44,509
Let's go.

371
00:26:45,142 --> 00:26:46,348
Let's go.

372
00:26:55,219 --> 00:26:59,861
He was supposed to be hot! What the hell!

373
00:26:59,924 --> 00:27:05,203
What a joke. He was pathetic.

374
00:27:10,901 --> 00:27:14,007
Don't be a pussy, Yoshida.

375
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:18,111
You gotta go for it!

376
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:30,226
- What?
- 10,000 yen.

377
00:27:30,287 --> 00:27:31,732
- No.
- Fine. 5,000.

378
00:27:31,789 --> 00:27:33,791
We agreed before. That was it.

379
00:27:33,891 --> 00:27:36,895
Those bikes don't come with brakes.

380
00:27:36,961 --> 00:27:39,942
Howl can I put on the brakes
when they can't?

381
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:42,306
You're not making sense.

382
00:27:42,767 --> 00:27:44,110
I'll double it.

383
00:27:44,201 --> 00:27:47,876
The boss will chew you out
if you don't write up that report.

384
00:27:47,938 --> 00:27:50,578
It's bullshit anyway. You do it.

385
00:27:58,315 --> 00:27:59,658
Going for a trifecta.

386
00:28:02,052 --> 00:28:03,622
YAMABE DETECTIVE AGENCY

387
00:28:03,721 --> 00:28:08,500
We had to chase him around in the river
wearing rubber boots.

388
00:28:08,592 --> 00:28:10,094
Right?

389
00:28:10,928 --> 00:28:12,430
We stank for days.

390
00:28:12,496 --> 00:28:14,976
Thank you so much for finding her.

391
00:28:15,065 --> 00:28:17,944
No more running away, okay?

392
00:28:18,002 --> 00:28:23,782
When I hear those clanging bells,
I just feel so alive.

393
00:28:23,841 --> 00:28:26,287
We only have chunky chili oil.

394
00:28:27,011 --> 00:28:28,615
This one might be old.

395
00:28:29,113 --> 00:28:33,255
Stock up on yuzu peppers
like at that ramen shop.

396
00:28:33,317 --> 00:28:36,696
Get it yourself. This isn't a cafeteria.

397
00:28:36,787 --> 00:28:38,198
Manami.

398
00:28:39,757 --> 00:28:42,135
Don't you feel that way
about anything else?

399
00:28:43,093 --> 00:28:44,970
I mean, you're just gambling.

400
00:28:45,763 --> 00:28:47,606
How can it make you feel alive?

401
00:28:47,665 --> 00:28:51,374
You just alienated
all 60 million bike racing fans in Japan.

402
00:28:51,469 --> 00:28:52,777
There aren't that many fans.

403
00:28:53,871 --> 00:28:57,444
Not everybody loves dogs.

404
00:28:57,508 --> 00:29:00,011
Manami, get me a wet towel.

405
00:29:02,146 --> 00:29:04,626
That's an impressive fruit basket.

406
00:29:05,516 --> 00:29:08,360
She doesn't even know
I padded her bill by ten days.

407
00:29:11,655 --> 00:29:14,067
What's going on with your case?

408
00:29:15,526 --> 00:29:17,028
What's going on?

409
00:29:17,127 --> 00:29:20,734
No sign of an affair yet.

410
00:29:21,165 --> 00:29:23,167
And the ex-boyfriend
the husband suspected?

411
00:29:23,234 --> 00:29:27,842
We looked into him, but nothing.
The husband probably imagined it.

412
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:32,221
He can't even trust his own wife.

413
00:29:32,843 --> 00:29:36,757
I think, every year,
men are becoming less manly.

414
00:29:37,147 --> 00:29:41,596
It's true.
All the stalkers these days are men.

415
00:29:41,685 --> 00:29:43,187
You're right.

416
00:29:43,754 --> 00:29:47,327
But we make a living off guys like that.

417
00:29:47,892 --> 00:29:52,398
We'd better thank the times,
this petty age we live in.

418
00:29:54,865 --> 00:29:58,677
OHTANI REAL ESTATE

419
00:31:28,158 --> 00:31:30,604
Why did my life turn out like this?

420
00:31:50,114 --> 00:31:52,116
THE EMPTY TABLE

421
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:14,372
Ryota.

422
00:32:15,072 --> 00:32:16,415
It's me, Machida.

423
00:32:21,345 --> 00:32:24,849
Say it's you before you knock.
You gave me a heart attack.

424
00:32:25,482 --> 00:32:29,589
What did you think I was here lo collect?
Electricity? Your gas bill?

425
00:32:30,254 --> 00:32:31,733
Could be anything.

426
00:32:43,734 --> 00:32:46,271
- It rained?
- This morning.

427
00:32:54,011 --> 00:32:55,615
Good thing it cleared up.

428
00:33:05,589 --> 00:33:07,694
That little pitcher can throw.

429
00:33:09,059 --> 00:33:10,470
Strike!

430
00:33:22,306 --> 00:33:25,549
Shingo! You can do it!

431
00:33:28,278 --> 00:33:33,159
Look at them,
already sitting together like that.

432
00:33:35,152 --> 00:33:38,326
Yamanouchi Real Estate is a huge company.

433
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:41,970
He makes 15 million yen a year.

434
00:33:43,293 --> 00:33:45,739
Probably from sleazy speculation deals.

435
00:33:46,897 --> 00:33:49,070
The pitchers scared of you!

436
00:33:51,401 --> 00:33:54,348
You think those two have done it already?

437
00:33:56,406 --> 00:33:57,646
I'm asking you.

438
00:34:01,345 --> 00:34:03,951
The high school he went to
excels in baseball.

439
00:34:04,014 --> 00:34:06,426
They beat our team my first year.

440
00:34:13,023 --> 00:34:14,502
Strike three!

441
00:34:17,694 --> 00:34:20,038
You gotta swing at it! Swing!

442
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:21,768
Don't worry.

443
00:34:22,499 --> 00:34:24,775
He was trying to draw a walk.

444
00:34:29,439 --> 00:34:32,215
Her boyfriend already bought him a glove.

445
00:34:35,846 --> 00:34:37,018
A Mizuno.

446
00:34:46,156 --> 00:34:48,363
- Go for it.
- Again.

447
00:34:51,361 --> 00:34:54,808
Yes! Now it's your turn.

448
00:34:54,865 --> 00:34:56,071
My turn?

449
00:34:59,469 --> 00:35:01,471
Okay, watch me.

450
00:35:01,538 --> 00:35:03,484
Swing with your hips.

451
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:15,252
Go for it.

452
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,431
Watch my hips.

453
00:35:20,991 --> 00:35:24,438
- Wow!
- Yeah!

454
00:35:27,831 --> 00:35:30,778
As a pinch hitter,
you have to swing the bat.

455
00:35:31,268 --> 00:35:33,111
You can't lose that chance.

456
00:35:33,203 --> 00:35:35,342
You'll try harder next time, right?

457
00:35:36,106 --> 00:35:37,744
I was trying to draw a walk.

458
00:35:38,542 --> 00:35:41,716
You can't be a hero
if you get on base like that.

459
00:35:42,045 --> 00:35:43,786
I don't need to be a hero.

460
00:35:44,414 --> 00:35:45,552
You don't?

461
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:48,860
Your table's ready, sir.

462
00:35:50,254 --> 00:35:51,255
Shall we?

463
00:35:52,089 --> 00:35:55,093
Shingo, who's your hero?
Who do you admire?

464
00:35:56,126 --> 00:35:57,070
Grandma.

465
00:35:57,127 --> 00:35:58,572
She's very wise.

466
00:35:58,629 --> 00:36:02,771
You can't list a relative as the person
you admire on those entrance exams.

467
00:36:02,866 --> 00:36:03,867
Really?

468
00:36:04,935 --> 00:36:06,710
Bathroom?

469
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:08,647
You know where it is?

470
00:36:08,739 --> 00:36:09,945
I'm fine.

471
00:36:18,248 --> 00:36:20,626
Do you two visit his grandma often?

472
00:36:20,717 --> 00:36:22,822
Yes, sometimes.

473
00:36:24,888 --> 00:36:27,232
Do you still have to?

474
00:36:27,291 --> 00:36:30,602
No, but Shingo's so fond of her.

475
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:43,440
Look at you.
You've gotten bigger down there.

476
00:36:43,941 --> 00:36:45,443
What are you doing here?

477
00:36:46,777 --> 00:36:48,814
Is that your mom's new boyfriend?

478
00:36:49,579 --> 00:36:50,580
Yeah.

479
00:36:50,948 --> 00:36:52,325
What's he like?

480
00:36:52,783 --> 00:36:54,160
He has a loud voice.

481
00:36:55,786 --> 00:36:58,858
- That must be embarrassing.
- Yeah.

482
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:02,798
Is she marrying him?

483
00:37:03,327 --> 00:37:04,601
I don't know.

484
00:37:04,661 --> 00:37:07,039
Ask her soon.

485
00:37:11,268 --> 00:37:12,679
I have to go.

486
00:37:12,769 --> 00:37:14,771
Okay. See you on Sunday.

487
00:37:18,942 --> 00:37:20,785
Do you have the money?

488
00:37:21,178 --> 00:37:23,681
No problem. Don't you worry.

489
00:37:35,859 --> 00:37:38,305
It's not good for Shingo either.

490
00:37:39,496 --> 00:37:41,203
I'm sorry to be so blunt...

491
00:37:42,065 --> 00:37:46,070
but he shouldn't spend time
with such an untrustworthy man.

492
00:37:49,473 --> 00:37:54,047
But he used to be a novelist.
It's just that, right now, he's...

493
00:37:54,811 --> 00:37:57,417
I read his award-winning novel.
Got it on Amazon.

494
00:37:57,514 --> 00:38:00,085
Really? What did you think?

495
00:38:06,757 --> 00:38:09,260
I won't say it was a waste of my time.

496
00:38:11,061 --> 00:38:15,066
But I just didn't get
what he was trying to say.

497
00:38:16,166 --> 00:38:17,668
I don't suppose you would.

498
00:38:17,734 --> 00:38:19,111
You think so, too?

499
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:22,013
I thought so.

500
00:38:28,078 --> 00:38:29,682
He touched his head.

501
00:38:32,115 --> 00:38:33,458
He's laughing.

502
00:38:34,084 --> 00:38:35,358
He sure is.

503
00:38:37,521 --> 00:38:39,057
Get lost.

504
00:38:46,229 --> 00:38:49,870
Weren't you better off
not knowing about the other guy?

505
00:38:52,636 --> 00:38:55,617
Why did she have to choose
a guy like that?

506
00:39:01,878 --> 00:39:05,883
I'm sorry. I asked you here,
and now I made you wait.

507
00:39:05,949 --> 00:39:07,428
I just got here.

508
00:39:07,918 --> 00:39:13,664
Thanks for that steak dinner,
even though I was of no help.

509
00:39:13,757 --> 00:39:15,100
The steak was too fatty.

510
00:39:15,158 --> 00:39:17,001
No, it was delicious.

511
00:39:17,094 --> 00:39:22,942
Listen, I'm wondering if you'd like
to write the story for a manga.

512
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,801
A manga?

513
00:39:25,268 --> 00:39:29,648
The rising star manga artist, Ishijima,
has been hired to illustrate it.

514
00:39:29,739 --> 00:39:33,846
It's a manga series about gambling
for our Comic Punch series.

515
00:39:33,944 --> 00:39:37,915
He asked me to introduce him
to a gambling expert

516
00:39:39,282 --> 00:39:41,319
Sure, I'm a gambling expert.

517
00:39:42,285 --> 00:39:46,859
What do you think? We could pay you well.

518
00:39:57,267 --> 00:40:00,544
Would my name be on it?

519
00:40:02,205 --> 00:40:05,482
If you don't want your name on it,
you can use a pen name

520
00:40:05,542 --> 00:40:08,182
so it won't harm your career.

521
00:40:08,278 --> 00:40:12,385
Actually,
I'm in a rush to finish my new novel.

522
00:40:12,482 --> 00:40:14,860
Hasn't your colleague told you?

523
00:40:16,887 --> 00:40:18,958
I see.

524
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:24,032
In that case,
I'd rather read your new work.

525
00:40:24,728 --> 00:40:26,571
Sorry for losing faith in you.

526
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:42,212
DAMAGED RICE CAKES
50 YEN EACH

527
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,323
Thank you.

528
00:40:46,082 --> 00:40:47,527
Thank you.

529
00:41:00,764 --> 00:41:02,539
RICE CAKES

530
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:04,374
Did you read my e-mail?

531
00:41:04,434 --> 00:41:06,277
You said you wouldn't do this.

532
00:41:06,369 --> 00:41:09,942
I know,
but I really feel like I can write again.

533
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,782
I've already quit the detective agency.

534
00:41:14,211 --> 00:41:16,919
Don't you dare write about us again.

535
00:41:17,013 --> 00:41:18,686
You're invading our privacy.

536
00:41:18,748 --> 00:41:20,455
My freedom of expression.

537
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:21,620
Listen to me.

538
00:41:21,718 --> 00:41:24,722
Our family memories
aren't your private property.

539
00:41:26,189 --> 00:41:28,191
Why don't you just give up?

540
00:41:28,258 --> 00:41:31,205
It's been 15 years
since you won that Shimada Shinsuke Award.

541
00:41:32,195 --> 00:41:36,644
You said that on purpose, Sis.
It was the Shimao Toshio Award.

542
00:41:37,267 --> 00:41:38,769
Not even close.

543
00:41:38,868 --> 00:41:41,781
I'd remember it right
if you'd won that famous Akutagawa Prize.

544
00:41:43,974 --> 00:41:46,386
Why did you give Mom money
when you're broke?

545
00:41:48,278 --> 00:41:51,122
She was so excited, she called to me.

546
00:41:53,083 --> 00:41:56,587
But now you want to borrow money from me?

547
00:41:57,153 --> 00:41:59,565
I don't want her to worry over money,

548
00:41:59,623 --> 00:42:01,967
given what Dad put her through.

549
00:42:03,627 --> 00:42:05,504
Dad came here, too.

550
00:42:07,497 --> 00:42:09,408
One month before he died.

551
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:13,811
He stood there, just like you.
“Please loan me some money."

552
00:42:15,772 --> 00:42:20,517
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
You hate being likened to Dad.

553
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:23,420
I do, but my situation is different.

554
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,153
No, it is not.

555
00:42:25,515 --> 00:42:27,517
You're exactly like Dad.

556
00:42:32,956 --> 00:42:35,368
If Dad had worked hard all his life,

557
00:42:35,458 --> 00:42:39,463
Mom could have moved
out of that housing complex years ago.

558
00:42:40,163 --> 00:42:41,198
Probably.

559
00:42:41,298 --> 00:42:44,541
She'd be living in a huge house
in a fancy neighborhood.

560
00:42:44,634 --> 00:42:48,309
That's right.
Her longtime, unfulfilled dream.

561
00:42:49,339 --> 00:42:51,046
When we lived in Nerima,

562
00:42:51,141 --> 00:42:54,350
Mom used to roll up
the bank passbook and seal in her stocking

563
00:42:54,444 --> 00:42:56,788
and hide them
in the bottom of the rice jar.

564
00:42:56,846 --> 00:42:59,952
But Dad found them anyway
and dug them out.

565
00:43:00,016 --> 00:43:03,054
There were grains of rice
on the kitchen floor.

566
00:43:03,153 --> 00:43:05,793
Mom flew into such a panic.

567
00:43:07,557 --> 00:43:09,901
And after she got rid of the rice jar?

568
00:43:09,993 --> 00:43:11,734
The space above the closet.

569
00:43:11,828 --> 00:43:14,638
With his bad legs,
Dad couldn't reach that high.

570
00:43:18,201 --> 00:43:19,202
What?

571
00:43:21,905 --> 00:43:24,249
Right, right.

572
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:01,045
Of all his pieces, Beethoven
was most satisfied with this one.

573
00:44:02,078 --> 00:44:03,751
Upon hearing this composition,

574
00:44:03,847 --> 00:44:09,092
Schubert is said to have reflected,
“After this, what music can we write?"

575
00:44:09,185 --> 00:44:11,791
I saw that scene in a film, right?

576
00:44:11,888 --> 00:44:16,098
With that actor who died.
Hoffman something or other.

577
00:44:16,192 --> 00:44:17,762
I don't watch films.

578
00:44:17,861 --> 00:44:22,469
Professor, didn't Beethoven write this
the year before he died?

579
00:44:22,565 --> 00:44:25,205
That's right. He was 56.

580
00:44:25,268 --> 00:44:28,909
In today's world,
he'd be considered elderly, like us.

581
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:34,616
When he was writing this...

582
00:44:34,711 --> 00:44:36,213
His daughter.

583
00:44:36,279 --> 00:44:38,452
She plays the violin.

584
00:44:38,548 --> 00:44:40,585
Apparently, she quit.

585
00:44:42,752 --> 00:44:47,098
We're still far too young to be elderly.

586
00:44:47,157 --> 00:44:50,001
I feel younger already.

587
00:44:50,093 --> 00:44:53,506
I wish there was a program like this
on television.

588
00:44:53,596 --> 00:44:55,769
I'd watch it every week.

589
00:44:55,832 --> 00:44:59,336
When I was younger, I got an offer
from the education channel.

590
00:44:59,436 --> 00:45:02,110
Wow! How amazing.

591
00:45:03,139 --> 00:45:07,519
But I thought that would be disrespectful
to the gods of music.

592
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:11,183
- So I turned them down.
- What a shame.

593
00:45:11,281 --> 00:45:14,626
But we're thrilled to have you
all to ourselves.

594
00:45:19,989 --> 00:45:22,663
See you next time.

595
00:45:26,496 --> 00:45:28,203
Look.

596
00:45:28,832 --> 00:45:30,140
Oh, yes.

597
00:45:33,636 --> 00:45:36,014
See you next week.

598
00:45:39,008 --> 00:45:41,010
CALPIS

599
00:46:46,276 --> 00:46:50,554
There's no way a guy like that
can make Noriko happy.

600
00:46:51,447 --> 00:46:54,428
We'll start investigating tomorrow.

601
00:46:54,517 --> 00:46:57,623
Please, I'm depending on you.

602
00:46:58,221 --> 00:46:59,791
We'll be in touch.

603
00:47:02,025 --> 00:47:05,029
Machida, do you want
to work this case alone?

604
00:47:06,262 --> 00:47:08,572
Go for it, young man.

605
00:47:09,365 --> 00:47:11,311
It's a standard background check.

606
00:47:11,401 --> 00:47:14,041
If you need help, take Manami.

607
00:47:14,604 --> 00:47:15,708
Fantastic.

608
00:47:15,772 --> 00:47:17,376
You're on a job, man.

609
00:47:18,541 --> 00:47:22,284
They're already divorced. She should
be able to date whoever she wants.

610
00:47:22,712 --> 00:47:24,885
Why envy the future?

611
00:47:26,649 --> 00:47:28,720
There's a guy like him sitting here.

612
00:47:30,119 --> 00:47:33,464
What are you talking about?
I'm not jealous.

613
00:47:33,556 --> 00:47:35,627
Really? What is it, then?

614
00:47:35,725 --> 00:47:36,931
Responsibility.

615
00:47:36,993 --> 00:47:39,667
No, you're still besotted with her.

616
00:47:39,762 --> 00:47:43,266
Do you even know what “besotted" means?

617
00:47:43,333 --> 00:47:44,333
I do.

618
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,640
How do you write it?

619
00:47:45,735 --> 00:47:48,773
It's written like this.

620
00:47:48,838 --> 00:47:50,681
- One line too many.
- No, there's not.

621
00:47:51,574 --> 00:47:56,523
You see, men only realize they're in love
after they've lost their beloved.

622
00:47:56,613 --> 00:48:00,993
Shinoda here
probably hugs his ex-wife's picture

623
00:48:01,084 --> 00:48:02,461
and cries himself to sleep.

624
00:48:02,518 --> 00:48:04,589
Maybe you do, too, boss.

625
00:48:04,654 --> 00:48:06,691
- One for each ex-wife.
- See?

626
00:48:06,789 --> 00:48:10,601
I'd rather hug you, Manami.

627
00:48:11,294 --> 00:48:12,602
No, thanks.

628
00:48:19,335 --> 00:48:21,542
Why am I out looking for a lost cat?

629
00:48:23,139 --> 00:48:24,812
You loved them that much?

630
00:48:25,842 --> 00:48:28,880
Of course. They're my family.

631
00:48:31,014 --> 00:48:32,118
What?

632
00:48:32,615 --> 00:48:37,530
But you never even mentioned them
before you got divorced.

633
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:39,327
That's not true.

634
00:48:45,395 --> 00:48:49,810
Let it go. If she remarries,
you won't have to pay child support.

635
00:48:50,867 --> 00:48:54,974
But then I won't be able
to see my son anymore.

636
00:48:59,075 --> 00:49:01,681
When he wants to see you,
he'll come to you.

637
00:49:04,681 --> 00:49:05,682
He will?

638
00:49:06,516 --> 00:49:07,517
Yes.

639
00:49:09,318 --> 00:49:10,991
No matter who tries to stop him.

640
00:49:12,021 --> 00:49:13,193
You saw yours?

641
00:49:13,256 --> 00:49:15,395
Yes, when I turned 20.

642
00:49:17,527 --> 00:49:19,200
I can't wait that long.

643
00:49:27,503 --> 00:49:29,073
He's dating his tutor?

644
00:49:30,173 --> 00:49:31,277
Probably.

645
00:49:33,843 --> 00:49:35,845
I took this high school's entrance exam.

646
00:49:37,513 --> 00:49:38,787
I didn't pass.

647
00:49:39,716 --> 00:49:41,354
Still pissed?

648
00:49:43,252 --> 00:49:45,289
What did you want to be in high school?

649
00:49:48,458 --> 00:49:49,903
I forget.

650
00:49:54,263 --> 00:49:56,539
- Ask me.
- How about you?

651
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,804
A civil servant.

652
00:49:59,969 --> 00:50:01,209
So conventional.

653
00:50:02,605 --> 00:50:04,949
I didn't want to turn out like Dad.

654
00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:09,121
Life is complicated.

655
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:15,730
Hey, that must be him.

656
00:50:31,067 --> 00:50:32,410
What?

657
00:50:33,636 --> 00:50:36,480
To see my son, I'll cross any tightrope.

658
00:50:36,572 --> 00:50:37,846
It's “any bridge.”

659
00:50:38,274 --> 00:50:39,514
Any bridge.

660
00:50:40,309 --> 00:50:42,152
A bridge is a kind of tightrope.

661
00:50:43,613 --> 00:50:45,286
If you say so.

662
00:50:48,284 --> 00:50:52,255
I'm not forcing you to stay.
I can do this alone.

663
00:50:52,321 --> 00:50:53,321
I'm in.

664
00:50:54,257 --> 00:50:56,259
I owe you one.

665
00:50:56,325 --> 00:50:58,635
You owe me? For what?

666
00:50:59,328 --> 00:51:01,365
It's no big deal if you don't remember.

667
00:51:19,816 --> 00:51:20,817
Here.

668
00:51:23,986 --> 00:51:26,694
Don't play with fire, kid.

669
00:51:27,456 --> 00:51:29,458
I'm not playing with her.

670
00:51:29,992 --> 00:51:31,403
She's playing with you.

671
00:51:32,662 --> 00:51:35,802
Whatever happens,
I'll never grow up to be a man like you.

672
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:42,340
Listen, it's not that easy growing up
to be the man you want to be.

673
00:51:49,912 --> 00:51:51,721
You sponge off of your folks.

674
00:51:58,654 --> 00:52:00,861
FLOWER SHOP

675
00:52:15,771 --> 00:52:17,614
A bouquet of red and pink flowers.

676
00:52:18,274 --> 00:52:20,276
He's not going on any business trip.

677
00:52:21,043 --> 00:52:25,185
She probably won't like it,
but his wife was right to suspect him.

678
00:52:26,015 --> 00:52:28,427
But she won't be sad, either.

679
00:52:28,517 --> 00:52:29,860
You never know.

680
00:52:55,478 --> 00:52:58,322
They've left the shop.
They're walking to the hotel now.

681
00:52:59,749 --> 00:53:01,956
Follow them in if you can.

682
00:53:03,753 --> 00:53:05,926
Don't worry, You look like a professional.

683
00:53:08,758 --> 00:53:09,964
That's a compliment.

684
00:53:17,433 --> 00:53:21,643
Hi there. It's me, Sumire.
I'm in the lobby now.

685
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:30,452
The other day,
you said, “Don't envy the future.”

686
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:32,281
Yes?

687
00:53:32,949 --> 00:53:38,524
Don't most girls erase the past
once they start a new relationship?

688
00:53:40,022 --> 00:53:42,024
Is this about your ex?

689
00:53:42,491 --> 00:53:44,971
No. Just in general.

690
00:53:45,661 --> 00:53:48,301
You know what I think?

691
00:53:48,364 --> 00:53:52,506
Using painting as a metaphor, girls
paint in oil rather than watercolors.

692
00:53:53,336 --> 00:53:56,374
New oil paint
covers up the old painting...

693
00:53:57,506 --> 00:53:59,850
even though it's still there.

694
00:54:00,810 --> 00:54:02,619
So it never goes away.

695
00:54:02,678 --> 00:54:04,680
Of course not.

696
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:07,386
It's not like replacing data.

697
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:09,151
Right.

698
00:54:26,168 --> 00:54:29,877
Such awful taste.
And those pathetic roses.

699
00:54:31,073 --> 00:54:33,679
Look ai him grinning like that.

700
00:54:35,911 --> 00:54:38,858
You made a fortune because of me, right?

701
00:54:38,914 --> 00:54:41,588
You can make it all back
from your husband.

702
00:54:43,486 --> 00:54:45,397
And more, thanks to these.

703
00:54:48,090 --> 00:54:50,934
Do you wish you hadn't found out?

704
00:54:51,027 --> 00:54:52,597
Not at all.

705
00:54:53,229 --> 00:54:56,540
For better or worse,
it's all pan of my life.

706
00:54:57,833 --> 00:54:59,540
See you. Thanks.

707
00:55:00,069 --> 00:55:01,275
Watch your step.

708
00:55:14,450 --> 00:55:16,760
No gambling it away this time.

709
00:55:16,852 --> 00:55:18,729
I know that.

710
00:55:19,889 --> 00:55:23,632
This will pay for the child support
and his cleats.

711
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,133
Not enough for rent.

712
00:55:27,229 --> 00:55:29,436
YAMABE DETECTIVE AGENCY

713
00:55:32,234 --> 00:55:35,943
Can you believe it? She was a friend
who had attended her wedding.

714
00:55:36,038 --> 00:55:37,642
That's awful.

715
00:55:38,974 --> 00:55:41,284
Under her very nose.

716
00:55:42,411 --> 00:55:46,484
I know a girl
who stole her friend's boyfriend.

717
00:55:47,083 --> 00:55:50,724
What's with you two?
Something happen last night?

718
00:55:51,153 --> 00:55:53,258
I am single for now.

719
00:55:54,090 --> 00:55:57,071
Good morning. Isn't today your day off?

720
00:55:57,660 --> 00:56:01,506
That was the plan, but...

721
00:56:05,501 --> 00:56:07,503
That typhoon is definitely on its way.

722
00:56:07,603 --> 00:56:10,982
Typhoon Number 24
is going to land on Kyushu today.

723
00:56:14,443 --> 00:56:15,649
Hey, Shinoda.

724
00:56:16,278 --> 00:56:18,485
You've gotten used to this work.

725
00:56:19,315 --> 00:56:24,424
Forget researching your novel
and make this your full-time job.

726
00:56:25,354 --> 00:56:28,528
I'm just here for my writing.

727
00:56:29,592 --> 00:56:30,935
Let me read it.

728
00:56:30,993 --> 00:56:33,701
What's it about?
Is the detective the lead character?

729
00:56:35,097 --> 00:56:36,269
It's not like that.

730
00:56:36,332 --> 00:56:41,714
Is it about a really bad detective
who shakes down high school kids?

731
00:56:43,339 --> 00:56:47,344
That high school kid is my boss's son,
from my days as a cop.

732
00:56:49,879 --> 00:56:51,825
Are you trying to ruin my agency?

733
00:56:52,615 --> 00:56:55,221
That's not my intention.

734
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:09,002
Is it because
I didn't pay you a summer bonus?

735
00:57:10,566 --> 00:57:12,239
Yes. No. Well...

736
00:57:12,334 --> 00:57:14,837
You want to see your son that badly?

737
00:57:14,904 --> 00:57:18,408
Of course. I'm his father.

738
00:57:18,507 --> 00:57:19,850
You, a father?

739
00:57:23,345 --> 00:57:25,018
Hand me the envelope.

740
00:57:30,486 --> 00:57:32,557
How much did you take him for?

741
00:57:32,655 --> 00:57:34,066
30,000 yen.

742
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:39,032
There's more in here.

743
00:57:40,529 --> 00:57:42,839
I stopped by the racetrack.

744
00:57:44,667 --> 00:57:47,910
Listen, stop seeing your son.

745
00:57:48,671 --> 00:57:53,848
It takes real guts to accept
that you're not in their lives anymore.

746
00:57:54,243 --> 00:57:55,517
Got that?

747
00:58:07,089 --> 00:58:09,729
Good thing you set aside 30,000 yen.

748
00:58:10,426 --> 00:58:11,632
Right.

749
00:58:12,528 --> 00:58:14,439
Are we still a bit short?

750
00:58:16,198 --> 00:58:17,575
Right.

751
00:58:21,604 --> 00:58:23,140
You know, Ryota,

752
00:58:24,039 --> 00:58:27,816
I still have the baseball glove
my dad bought me when I was nine.

753
00:58:29,411 --> 00:58:30,412
So...

754
00:58:32,381 --> 00:58:33,792
Use these...

755
00:58:36,151 --> 00:58:37,960
to buy him cleats or a bat.

756
00:58:40,589 --> 00:58:41,932
Right.

757
00:58:43,826 --> 00:58:46,466
But stop being so nice to me.

758
00:58:48,664 --> 00:58:49,938
You'll make me cry.

759
00:59:13,589 --> 00:59:15,591
A used book fair.

760
00:59:15,658 --> 00:59:18,434
We used to come to these together.

761
00:59:18,494 --> 00:59:20,531
Why are you always late?

762
00:59:20,629 --> 00:59:24,133
I had a meeting with my publisher.

763
00:59:24,199 --> 00:59:25,837
On a Sunday?

764
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:27,973
I'm always working.

765
00:59:29,972 --> 00:59:32,179
Where's my 100,000 yen?

766
00:59:32,708 --> 00:59:36,383
I got back late last night
and couldn't get to an ATM.

767
00:59:36,478 --> 00:59:38,981
And the banks closed today.

768
00:59:40,449 --> 00:59:42,053
I couldn't find Dad's book.

769
00:59:42,885 --> 00:59:45,627
You should have just told me.
Let's go, Shingo.

770
00:59:47,623 --> 00:59:50,297
I look forward to our monthly visit.

771
00:59:50,359 --> 00:59:52,703
Don't cancel it over a minor detail.

772
00:59:52,795 --> 00:59:57,073
A minor detail? That's what you agreed to.

773
00:59:57,166 --> 00:59:59,544
- You know I'll pay.
- When?

774
01:00:00,536 --> 01:00:01,480
Later today.

775
01:00:01,537 --> 01:00:05,986
5:00 p.m. sharp, here.
Pay up in full and don't be late.

776
01:00:08,043 --> 01:00:10,387
Cant we all have tea together?

777
01:00:10,479 --> 01:00:13,153
I have to go to work.
I'm always working, too.

778
01:00:14,249 --> 01:00:15,523
See you later.

779
01:00:16,151 --> 01:00:17,357
Later.

780
01:00:37,606 --> 01:00:39,244
I'd like these.

781
01:00:40,275 --> 01:00:43,085
Don't hold back.

782
01:00:43,178 --> 01:00:45,055
I'll buy you the Mizuno.

783
01:00:45,114 --> 01:00:47,287
- Are you sure?
- You bet.

784
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:49,854
You're a size 3.5?

785
01:00:50,786 --> 01:00:52,891
Wait here, okay?

786
01:01:03,432 --> 01:01:05,639
- Excuse me.
- May I help you?

787
01:01:05,734 --> 01:01:08,544
I want these, but it's scuffed here.

788
01:01:09,438 --> 01:01:12,476
I'll check the stockroom for another pair.

789
01:01:12,574 --> 01:01:14,554
That pair is fine...

790
01:01:15,144 --> 01:01:17,715
but can I get a discount?

791
01:01:26,155 --> 01:01:27,828
What did you ask her?

792
01:01:28,557 --> 01:01:29,900
“Do you like him?”

793
01:01:30,759 --> 01:01:33,330
- And she said?
- “Yes, I do."

794
01:01:34,496 --> 01:01:35,770
Go on.

795
01:01:35,831 --> 01:01:38,573
“You don't want me to date another man?”

796
01:01:40,302 --> 01:01:43,909
Thanks for waiting. Here's your burger.

797
01:01:48,911 --> 01:01:50,322
Enjoy.

798
01:01:51,647 --> 01:01:52,785
Where's yours?

799
01:01:53,415 --> 01:01:55,258
I'm not hungry.

800
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:58,524
And what did you say?

801
01:02:00,789 --> 01:02:02,666
“If you really like him, it's okay.”

802
01:02:05,928 --> 01:02:10,343
That's when you have to say “No.”
Loud and clear.

803
01:02:11,333 --> 01:02:12,334
And?

804
01:02:13,435 --> 01:02:15,381
“Do you like him or Dad better?”

805
01:02:16,472 --> 01:02:17,780
What did she say?

806
01:02:18,507 --> 01:02:21,386
“That's so long ago. I forgot.”

807
01:02:30,619 --> 01:02:32,462
Want to buy a lottery ticket?

808
01:02:35,023 --> 01:02:37,230
Mom will get mad.

809
01:02:37,326 --> 01:02:38,634
Don't worry.

810
01:02:38,694 --> 01:02:41,231
Let's buy one to remember.

811
01:02:41,330 --> 01:02:42,502
What?

812
01:02:42,564 --> 01:02:44,066
“What?”

813
01:02:44,166 --> 01:02:46,544
To remember our bond.

814
01:02:47,169 --> 01:02:48,307
Hello, sir.

815
01:02:50,339 --> 01:02:51,841
You pick.

816
01:02:52,541 --> 01:02:54,145
- Can I?
- Sure.

817
01:02:54,209 --> 01:02:57,679
Your grandpa and I bought tickets
starting in kindergarten.

818
01:02:58,747 --> 01:03:02,820
But I'm paying for the ticket,
so we split the winnings. Deal?

819
01:03:03,652 --> 01:03:04,653
Stingy.

820
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:07,166
DOM talk to your father like that.

821
01:03:07,222 --> 01:03:09,600
There are two kinds of tickets.

822
01:03:09,691 --> 01:03:13,036
Singles are more fun
when you're checking to see if you've won.

823
01:03:13,095 --> 01:03:15,541
I'm getting singles. How about you?

824
01:03:15,931 --> 01:03:18,002
Let me see.

825
01:03:21,703 --> 01:03:24,775
Thank you. Enjoy, please.

826
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:28,114
Hello. It's me.

827
01:03:30,379 --> 01:03:33,053
What are you talking about?
I'm not Dad's ghost.

828
01:03:33,115 --> 01:03:37,689
Can I come over now? Shingo's with me.

829
01:03:39,187 --> 01:03:42,566
He has something
he wants to show his grandma.

830
01:03:50,365 --> 01:03:52,038
He's coming?

831
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:54,307
With the typhoon approaching?

832
01:03:54,403 --> 01:03:56,610
He's bringing Shingo along.

833
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:59,112
This feels great.

834
01:03:59,207 --> 01:04:01,312
Right? My co workers love it.

835
01:04:03,478 --> 01:04:06,425
- Be careful.
- Of what?

836
01:04:06,481 --> 01:04:08,222
He's up to something.

837
01:04:08,283 --> 01:04:11,287
He never used to visit,
not even on New Year's.

838
01:04:12,821 --> 01:04:14,823
Maybe he wants help.

839
01:04:14,923 --> 01:04:16,732
Financially, you mean?

840
01:04:16,792 --> 01:04:18,328
No, with his ex-wife.

841
01:04:18,427 --> 01:04:20,907
It's too late for that.

842
01:04:22,164 --> 01:04:25,077
People give up so easily these days.

843
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:27,912
I think she put up with a lot.

844
01:04:28,403 --> 01:04:30,906
A decently educated woman...

845
01:04:32,140 --> 01:04:34,086
can support herself.

846
01:04:34,610 --> 01:04:36,487
I think that's great.

847
01:04:40,983 --> 01:04:42,656
Cant they get back together?

848
01:04:43,452 --> 01:04:45,432
I think this will hold for now.

849
01:04:45,487 --> 01:04:47,262
Oh, thank you.

850
01:04:47,322 --> 01:04:50,166
Thank you so much for your help.

851
01:04:50,258 --> 01:04:52,499
He likes helping out like this.

852
01:04:52,594 --> 01:04:54,267
She's right.

853
01:04:54,696 --> 01:04:58,303
The truth is,
this is what I wanted to do for a living.

854
01:05:00,035 --> 01:05:01,207
Don't do it.

855
01:05:01,303 --> 01:05:02,646
Do what?

856
01:05:02,704 --> 01:05:04,877
Don't take them out to sushi.

857
01:05:05,941 --> 01:05:08,285
Why not? We're friendly.

858
01:05:08,343 --> 01:05:10,186
I don't think Kyoko likes it.

859
01:05:10,278 --> 01:05:13,885
If you do, take them where the sushi
isn't sewed on a conveyor belt.

860
01:05:18,153 --> 01:05:21,191
That's where I took abacus lessons.

861
01:05:22,190 --> 01:05:25,967
Hey, the Chinese restaurant is gone.

862
01:05:29,665 --> 01:05:34,171
<i>Next stop, Housing Complex Center.</i>

863
01:05:35,037 --> 01:05:36,744
<i>Stopping next.</i>

864
01:05:48,817 --> 01:05:52,390
One time, I snuck inside that thing
to eat snacks during a typhoon

865
01:05:52,487 --> 01:05:55,263
late at night with your grandpa.

866
01:05:56,358 --> 01:05:58,065
Wasn't it dark?

867
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:00,003
We had flashlights.

868
01:06:01,563 --> 01:06:03,873
- Did you get into trouble?
- Who with?

869
01:06:04,833 --> 01:06:07,109
- With your mom.
- Your grandma?

870
01:06:07,869 --> 01:06:10,440
We snuck out and snuck back in.

871
01:06:22,851 --> 01:06:27,027
Once, my friends and I climbed
all the way to the top of that tower.

872
01:06:29,391 --> 01:06:32,770
One of them got too scared
to climb back down.

873
01:06:33,729 --> 01:06:35,402
Why did you climb n?

874
01:06:35,464 --> 01:06:38,934
Why? Because it's the symbol
of this housing complex.

875
01:06:39,034 --> 01:06:39,944
That's weird.

876
01:06:40,035 --> 01:06:42,743
It's not weird. Don't you do that stuff?

877
01:06:42,804 --> 01:06:44,784
- No.
- Really?

878
01:07:03,792 --> 01:07:05,965
What are you doing here?

879
01:07:06,061 --> 01:07:08,098
Have I ruined your plan?

880
01:07:08,163 --> 01:07:09,938
I didn't say that.

881
01:07:09,998 --> 01:07:13,172
We came to fix the window you broke.

882
01:07:14,436 --> 01:07:15,813
The perfect daughter.

883
01:07:15,904 --> 01:07:18,646
I work extra hard doing your pan, too.

884
01:07:18,740 --> 01:07:20,777
Look who's talking.

885
01:07:20,842 --> 01:07:23,254
Can't you cook dinner for your family?

886
01:07:23,311 --> 01:07:24,949
Stay out of it.

887
01:07:28,817 --> 01:07:30,194
Grandma, sweeten mine.

888
01:07:30,285 --> 01:07:33,266
- What now?
- She wants something to drink.

889
01:07:33,321 --> 01:07:35,927
Why can't you drink plain water?

890
01:07:37,359 --> 01:07:41,432
I'm going to take figure skating lessons.
Grandma's paying for them.

891
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:47,776
That's great. You must be thrilled.

892
01:07:48,870 --> 01:07:50,508
That explains it.

893
01:07:50,605 --> 01:07:52,380
Explains what?

894
01:07:52,474 --> 01:07:55,318
Figia skating? Whose princess is she?

895
01:07:56,344 --> 01:07:58,847
It's pronounced “figure.”

896
01:07:59,815 --> 01:08:02,022
So we commoners can't skate?

897
01:08:02,117 --> 01:08:06,190
Not by paying for it
with your mother's pension. Poor Mom.

898
01:08:06,822 --> 01:08:11,794
And who was the kid who used to take
very expensive violin lessons?

899
01:08:17,132 --> 01:08:18,975
Don't you take advantage...

900
01:08:19,034 --> 01:08:21,480
Of me or Mom.

901
01:08:22,737 --> 01:08:24,648
We're going home when you're done.

902
01:08:26,141 --> 01:08:27,552
Staying over?

903
01:08:27,642 --> 01:08:29,144
I'm going home.

904
01:08:29,211 --> 01:08:30,485
What about Shingo?

905
01:08:31,413 --> 01:08:34,223
Kyoko said she'd pick him up.
I called her.

906
01:08:34,316 --> 01:08:36,262
Kyoko's coming?

907
01:08:36,351 --> 01:08:38,558
Let's stick around a little longer.

908
01:08:38,653 --> 01:08:42,430
Stop grinning like that.
She's your sister-in-law.

909
01:08:42,524 --> 01:08:45,004
Ex-sister-in-law.

910
01:08:45,527 --> 01:08:47,370
Hey, now.

911
01:08:47,429 --> 01:08:50,069
We're going home. The typhoon's coming.

912
01:08:55,270 --> 01:08:58,581
You want to see my ex-wife that much?

913
01:09:03,612 --> 01:09:05,717
Kyoko, how have you been?

914
01:09:05,780 --> 01:09:07,453
Oh, hello.

915
01:09:07,549 --> 01:09:09,756
The typhoon's coming. Better hurry.

916
01:09:09,851 --> 01:09:11,797
Thanks. I will.

917
01:09:12,387 --> 01:09:14,958
Good luck with your entrance exams.

918
01:09:15,056 --> 01:09:17,627
- I'm going for a private school.
- Don't be silly.

919
01:09:17,726 --> 01:09:20,969
- I'm gonna be a figia skater.
- It's pronounced “gure."

920
01:09:21,529 --> 01:09:23,270
- Bye-bye.
- See you.

921
01:09:23,365 --> 01:09:24,776
See you.

922
01:09:38,380 --> 01:09:41,953
I'm sorry, Mother.
This wasn't the original plan.

923
01:09:42,050 --> 01:09:44,223
Don't be. The more, the merrier.

924
01:09:44,286 --> 01:09:46,232
- Hi, Mom.
- That was fast.

925
01:09:46,288 --> 01:09:48,996
Don't wear shoes inside the house.

926
01:09:49,090 --> 01:09:51,969
Take them off.
You're scratching the floor.

927
01:09:52,060 --> 01:09:53,562
They're cleats, not shoes.

928
01:09:53,628 --> 01:09:56,973
The floor's all worn out anyway,
just like me.

929
01:09:57,065 --> 01:09:58,408
I'm so sorry.

930
01:09:58,466 --> 01:09:59,843
Come inside, Kyoko.

931
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:03,405
You're soaked! I'll get you a towel.

932
01:10:06,942 --> 01:10:09,786
Don't make me worry like this.

933
01:10:10,512 --> 01:10:12,788
Shingo insisted on coming.

934
01:10:12,847 --> 01:10:14,121
Blaming your son.

935
01:10:14,182 --> 01:10:17,322
Come inside, both of you.

936
01:10:17,419 --> 01:10:19,296
Just for a bit, then.

937
01:10:50,452 --> 01:10:52,193
Don't cut your fingers.

938
01:10:57,492 --> 01:11:00,701
You're doing a great job.

939
01:11:19,347 --> 01:11:22,487
Throw in some green peas, too, for color.

940
01:11:22,550 --> 01:11:23,995
I know.

941
01:11:24,052 --> 01:11:25,690
He loves his peas.

942
01:11:33,094 --> 01:11:35,768
Are you the fifth shortest
in your <i>class</i> now?

943
01:11:35,864 --> 01:11:37,104
Third shortest.

944
01:11:38,333 --> 01:11:41,940
Your dad didn't start growing
until junior high.

945
01:11:42,837 --> 01:11:45,374
You're 4'9“ now?

946
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:47,181
4'9 1/2".

947
01:11:47,242 --> 01:11:49,620
Let me see your legs.

948
01:11:50,278 --> 01:11:52,588
Look, he's got firm knees.

949
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:54,887
He's not a dog. You can't tell that way.

950
01:11:54,949 --> 01:11:58,192
It's true for all animals.

951
01:11:59,387 --> 01:12:00,627
See? You'll be taller.

952
01:12:01,423 --> 01:12:03,699
You will. You will, you will.

953
01:12:04,426 --> 01:12:06,372
Three times, sounds like a lie.

954
01:12:10,765 --> 01:12:15,612
“She made a kimono for me,
sewing it herself,

955
01:12:15,703 --> 01:12:19,742
and everyone is thrilled when I wear it,
which makes me happy.

956
01:12:19,808 --> 01:12:24,120
But it is a little embarrassing
when they say I look adorable in it.

957
01:12:24,779 --> 01:12:28,625
I'm so happy
that you do so many things for me.

958
01:12:29,717 --> 01:12:34,632
But working so hard,
I'm sure you get tired, so please rest.

959
01:12:34,722 --> 01:12:37,965
Please keep living for a long time,
Grandma.”

960
01:12:40,261 --> 01:12:43,731
You really wanted
to read it out loud to her, right?

961
01:12:44,466 --> 01:12:46,104
That makes me so happy.

962
01:12:46,167 --> 01:12:49,148
But if you're going to admire someone,

963
01:12:49,237 --> 01:12:54,846
you should pick someone like Mother Teresa
or some astronaut.

964
01:12:54,943 --> 01:12:56,684
This one, there.

965
01:12:58,146 --> 01:13:01,855
Beautiful. You can still find these?

966
01:13:01,950 --> 01:13:04,954
There's still a lot of greenery
around here.

967
01:13:06,087 --> 01:13:07,088
Amazing.

968
01:13:07,155 --> 01:13:09,863
That one was on my tangerine.

969
01:13:09,958 --> 01:13:11,130
Your tangerine?

970
01:13:11,192 --> 01:13:13,433
It was on the leaves, the caterpillar.

971
01:13:13,495 --> 01:13:15,771
- How old was Shingo?
- About three, I think.

972
01:13:15,830 --> 01:13:16,831
A larva.

973
01:13:16,931 --> 01:13:18,308
Three.

974
01:13:18,366 --> 01:13:20,505
Is that strawberry field gone?

975
01:13:20,602 --> 01:13:24,448
Yes. They built a house on ii last year.

976
01:13:24,506 --> 01:13:27,385
If I'd known,
I would have visited it more often.

977
01:13:27,475 --> 01:13:28,476
Seconds?

978
01:13:28,543 --> 01:13:30,181
Yes, please.

979
01:13:30,278 --> 01:13:32,189
You were really hungry.

980
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:35,193
I haven't tasted that in a long time.
It's great.

981
01:13:35,283 --> 01:13:37,354
Shingo, you have seconds, too.

982
01:13:37,452 --> 01:13:39,022
Seconds?

983
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:44,160
Even as a child, he always loved my food,
no matter what I cooked.

984
01:13:44,225 --> 01:13:45,704
That was his only virtue.

985
01:13:45,793 --> 01:13:48,034
What do you mean “my only”?

986
01:13:48,496 --> 01:13:51,409
The curry flavor infuses everything.

987
01:13:51,499 --> 01:13:54,571
Right? I use fish broth for the soup.

988
01:13:55,003 --> 01:13:56,573
His father loved this.

989
01:13:56,671 --> 01:14:00,084
I made a lot of it
and kept it in the freezer.

990
01:14:00,175 --> 01:14:01,552
What?

991
01:14:01,643 --> 01:14:03,316
This is six months old?

992
01:14:03,378 --> 01:14:07,986
Don't make such a fuss.
Besides, it's too late now.

993
01:14:08,516 --> 01:14:11,588
Men pay too much attention
to expiration dates.

994
01:14:11,686 --> 01:14:13,893
Of course we do.

995
01:14:14,689 --> 01:14:16,566
You do, too. Right, Shingo?

996
01:14:16,658 --> 01:14:19,366
Look. There's curry on your shin.

997
01:14:21,996 --> 01:14:25,705
Hey, did you just lick that cloth?

998
01:14:25,767 --> 01:14:27,440
That's disgusting.

999
01:14:27,535 --> 01:14:28,946
Who are you calling disgusting?

1000
01:14:29,037 --> 01:14:30,607
I can do it myself.

1001
01:14:30,705 --> 01:14:33,549
I've wiped your poo and pee.

1002
01:14:34,075 --> 01:14:36,021
Oh, my.

1003
01:14:36,077 --> 01:14:41,117
He may be a grown man, but he still
needs someone to take care of him.

1004
01:14:42,850 --> 01:14:44,056
Is it gone?

1005
01:14:47,255 --> 01:14:50,031
Please spend the night.

1006
01:14:51,125 --> 01:14:54,971
You're leaving Grandma all alone
in this storm?

1007
01:14:55,430 --> 01:14:58,536
There she goes again,
like she's on her deathbed.

1008
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:02,377
I have extra futons,
and I just washed the sheets.

1009
01:15:02,437 --> 01:15:03,711
But Shingo has school.

1010
01:15:03,771 --> 01:15:05,648
The schools will close.

1011
01:15:05,740 --> 01:15:10,917
But if he has to go to school,
he can leave early tomorrow morning.

1012
01:15:10,979 --> 01:15:13,391
I didn't bring a change of clothes.

1013
01:15:14,048 --> 01:15:15,049
I see.

1014
01:15:15,883 --> 01:15:18,124
It's a 30-minute wait for a taxi.

1015
01:15:18,653 --> 01:15:22,601
If you gel home that late,
Shingo will get to bed too late.

1016
01:15:22,657 --> 01:15:24,102
It's not good for him.

1017
01:15:29,063 --> 01:15:31,634
- Okay, then.
- Great. I'll heat the bath.

1018
01:15:31,733 --> 01:15:34,270
- No taxi, then.
- He needs a toothbrush.

1019
01:15:34,335 --> 01:15:36,076
And he needs pajamas.

1020
01:15:36,137 --> 01:15:40,142
Can Shingo still fit into his pajamas
from two years ago?

1021
01:15:40,241 --> 01:15:43,916
She comes right back to life.

1022
01:15:43,978 --> 01:15:45,821
Incredible.

1023
01:16:01,596 --> 01:16:06,375
See? Your father also wrote well,
even as a child.

1024
01:16:11,806 --> 01:16:15,447
Maybe you've got flair, too.

1025
01:16:15,510 --> 01:16:17,319
What's “flair”?

1026
01:16:17,378 --> 01:16:21,349
Don't make a face. It's nothing bad.

1027
01:16:21,449 --> 01:16:22,519
It's not?

1028
01:16:22,617 --> 01:16:24,358
That's right.

1029
01:16:25,186 --> 01:16:27,962
It's a wonderful talent.

1030
01:16:28,956 --> 01:16:31,527
Not everyone has it.

1031
01:16:36,864 --> 01:16:38,901
You don't want to be like your father,
do you?

1032
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,206
No.

1033
01:16:40,301 --> 01:16:41,541
Why not?

1034
01:16:41,636 --> 01:16:46,244
Mom left Dad
because she didn't like him, right?

1035
01:16:46,341 --> 01:16:48,912
They got married
because they loved each other.

1036
01:16:49,010 --> 01:16:51,149
That's why you were born.

1037
01:16:52,246 --> 01:16:55,318
Do you think Dad likes us?

1038
01:16:55,383 --> 01:16:57,158
You know he does.

1039
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:04,193
If we win the lottery,
could we all live together again?

1040
01:17:05,193 --> 01:17:08,936
Well, maybe. Maybe you can.

1041
01:17:09,997 --> 01:17:15,106
If we do, let's build a big house
so you can move in and live with us.

1042
01:17:15,203 --> 01:17:17,513
Your invitation makes me so happy.

1043
01:17:18,406 --> 01:17:21,182
Please, do make that happen.

1044
01:17:43,898 --> 01:17:46,777
Hey, Mom, let's play a game.

1045
01:17:47,235 --> 01:17:48,714
At this hour?

1046
01:17:48,770 --> 01:17:50,909
Yeah, Game of Life.

1047
01:17:50,972 --> 01:17:53,646
Okay. But only one round.

1048
01:18:11,125 --> 01:18:13,264
Twelve, 13...

1049
01:18:14,095 --> 01:18:15,472
14.

1050
01:18:17,465 --> 01:18:20,002
- Who won?
- Let me see.

1051
01:18:20,101 --> 01:18:22,604
- I did.
- Good job.

1052
01:18:23,504 --> 01:18:27,975
The bathtub here is too small.
I haven't been in it in a while.

1053
01:18:28,810 --> 01:18:30,153
A bath, Shingo?

1054
01:18:31,012 --> 01:18:32,286
Can't decide.

1055
01:18:32,346 --> 01:18:34,917
Take a bath. <i>It'll</i> feel great.

1056
01:18:34,982 --> 01:18:38,327
Mom, you need to clean the drain.

1057
01:18:38,419 --> 01:18:40,831
There were dust fluffs in the bath.

1058
01:18:40,922 --> 01:18:42,765
Those dust bunnies?

1059
01:18:42,824 --> 01:18:44,929
Dust bunnies in the bath?

1060
01:18:44,992 --> 01:18:48,371
Sure. In the bathwater.

1061
01:18:49,831 --> 01:18:51,208
Who's winning?

1062
01:18:52,667 --> 01:18:54,169
Let me play, too.

1063
01:18:54,268 --> 01:18:56,111
The three of us, then.

1064
01:18:56,537 --> 01:18:59,882
I'll sit out this round.
You two go right ahead.

1065
01:18:59,974 --> 01:19:04,616
In that case, I'll go take a bath.
I want to see the dust bunnies.

1066
01:19:04,679 --> 01:19:06,659
Good, go take a bath.

1067
01:19:09,050 --> 01:19:12,520
If the water's too hot,
right is cold, left is hot.

1068
01:19:12,620 --> 01:19:13,826
I know.

1069
01:19:18,192 --> 01:19:21,503
Shall we play a round?

1070
01:19:21,562 --> 01:19:23,041
Not a chance.

1071
01:19:23,130 --> 01:19:26,134
Playing Game of Life with you
is like a bad joke.

1072
01:19:28,202 --> 01:19:29,476
Are you mad?

1073
01:19:30,805 --> 01:19:33,251
What did you and Shingo do today?

1074
01:19:35,376 --> 01:19:36,980
I bought him cleats.

1075
01:19:38,012 --> 01:19:40,014
We had burgers.

1076
01:19:40,081 --> 01:19:42,721
Not McDonald's, the better place.

1077
01:19:42,817 --> 01:19:44,023
What else?

1078
01:19:47,488 --> 01:19:50,992
Please don't drag him
into that 'hobby' of yours.

1079
01:19:51,058 --> 01:19:53,334
What harm is a lottery ticket?

1080
01:19:56,430 --> 01:19:59,570
I want to raise Shingo to work hard...

1081
01:20:00,234 --> 01:20:01,907
not make money by gambling.

1082
01:20:02,003 --> 01:20:03,175
The lottery.

1083
01:20:03,604 --> 01:20:06,278
The lottery isn't gambling.

1084
01:20:06,374 --> 01:20:08,012
Of course it is.

1085
01:20:08,075 --> 01:20:10,214
No, it is not.

1086
01:20:11,012 --> 01:20:12,423
What is it, then?

1087
01:20:12,780 --> 01:20:14,191
It's a dream.

1088
01:20:15,383 --> 01:20:18,592
A dream you buy for 300 yen.

1089
01:20:18,686 --> 01:20:20,131
That's gambling.

1090
01:20:21,255 --> 01:20:26,034
You just alienated
all 60 million lottery fans in Japan.

1091
01:20:26,093 --> 01:20:28,972
I'm happy to alienate them all.

1092
01:20:41,142 --> 01:20:42,382
Say, Mom.

1093
01:20:42,944 --> 01:20:45,550
Mom, that's not...

1094
01:20:45,613 --> 01:20:49,060
This was your father's futon.
I had it cleaned, so it doesn't stink.

1095
01:20:49,116 --> 01:20:51,392
That's not what I mean.

1096
01:20:51,452 --> 01:20:54,399
We're not like that anymore.

1097
01:20:54,455 --> 01:20:55,832
Please don't.

1098
01:20:55,923 --> 01:20:59,962
Shingo can sleep in between you two.

1099
01:21:00,061 --> 01:21:02,940
A rare family get-together.

1100
01:21:22,116 --> 01:21:24,255
He's got real talent.

1101
01:21:24,318 --> 01:21:27,265
It's rare for a child in grade school
to structure an essay like that.

1102
01:21:28,356 --> 01:21:29,994
You think so?

1103
01:21:31,092 --> 01:21:32,833
You should give him lots to read.

1104
01:21:33,461 --> 01:21:34,769
Like what?

1105
01:21:35,463 --> 01:21:40,344
For example,
books by E.T. Seton and Jean-Henri Fabre.

1106
01:21:40,434 --> 01:21:42,277
<i>And Doctor Dolittle.</i>

1107
01:21:43,604 --> 01:21:45,515
I'll send him a selection of books.

1108
01:21:47,308 --> 01:21:48,685
Thank you.

1109
01:21:50,478 --> 01:21:52,287
Well,

1110
01:21:52,346 --> 01:21:55,225
that's all I can do now.

1111
01:21:58,486 --> 01:22:00,124
Are you writing?

1112
01:22:01,188 --> 01:22:02,667
Me?

1113
01:22:05,292 --> 01:22:07,863
You know, these days,

1114
01:22:08,329 --> 01:22:10,900
literature is out of fashion.

1115
01:22:11,465 --> 01:22:13,570
It's all light, pop fiction.

1116
01:22:13,668 --> 01:22:15,409
Same old complaint.

1117
01:22:16,237 --> 01:22:18,012
Speaking of which,

1118
01:22:18,072 --> 01:22:23,385
I got an offer
to write the story for a manga series.

1119
01:22:23,878 --> 01:22:27,382
I'm thinking I should give it a try.

1120
01:22:27,481 --> 01:22:31,520
I kept trying to tell you to do that,
but you never listened.

1121
01:22:33,187 --> 01:22:38,500
If I take that job,
I'll be able to pay monthly child support.

1122
01:22:40,928 --> 01:22:43,568
You don't have to work so hard
just to visit him.

1123
01:22:44,899 --> 01:22:46,606
I really want to see him.

1124
01:22:47,435 --> 01:22:49,676
I'm taking responsibility as his father.

1125
01:22:51,038 --> 01:22:54,713
“Taking responsibility”
is acting like his father once a month?

1126
01:22:54,775 --> 01:22:58,052
Wait a minute. Don't call it acting.

1127
01:22:58,112 --> 01:23:00,183
That's all it is.

1128
01:23:01,048 --> 01:23:02,425
Well...

1129
01:23:03,117 --> 01:23:06,121
I'm happy to see him every week.

1130
01:23:06,220 --> 01:23:08,063
You know you can't.

1131
01:23:08,122 --> 01:23:11,763
If you're that interested
in being a good father,

1132
01:23:11,859 --> 01:23:14,772
why didn't you try harder before?

1133
01:23:16,964 --> 01:23:18,238
You're right.

1134
01:23:23,804 --> 01:23:25,750
We're divorced now.

1135
01:23:31,445 --> 01:23:33,482
But it's not over.

1136
01:23:34,815 --> 01:23:35,987
What?

1137
01:23:36,450 --> 01:23:39,329
I'm always going to be Shingo's father...

1138
01:23:40,087 --> 01:23:43,933
whatever happens between us
as husband and wife.

1139
01:23:50,931 --> 01:23:52,137
Wait.

1140
01:23:53,601 --> 01:23:57,481
You're already in a new relationship?

1141
01:23:58,939 --> 01:24:01,476
Well, yes.

1142
01:24:05,312 --> 01:24:06,757
Oh?

1143
01:24:07,648 --> 01:24:08,648
Really?

1144
01:24:10,584 --> 01:24:12,427
Another man?

1145
01:24:12,486 --> 01:24:13,692
Why?

1146
01:24:15,523 --> 01:24:17,264
Did Shingo say something?

1147
01:24:18,359 --> 01:24:20,305
So it's true.

1148
01:24:24,098 --> 01:24:25,509
Have you...

1149
01:24:27,001 --> 01:24:28,378
already...

1150
01:24:29,503 --> 01:24:30,641
done it?

1151
01:24:31,205 --> 01:24:33,617
Don't talk about that here.

1152
01:24:34,175 --> 01:24:35,518
Have you?

1153
01:24:37,511 --> 01:24:38,956
Yes.

1154
01:24:40,047 --> 01:24:41,321
You have.

1155
01:24:41,782 --> 01:24:43,193
So, you have.

1156
01:24:43,284 --> 01:24:45,958
Of course we have. We're not teenagers.

1157
01:24:47,121 --> 01:24:48,862
Are you going to marry him?

1158
01:24:48,956 --> 01:24:50,799
I don't know yet.

1159
01:24:52,026 --> 01:24:56,133
You did it before you decided?
Couldn't you wait?

1160
01:24:56,630 --> 01:24:58,576
Who decides those things before doing it?

1161
01:24:58,666 --> 01:25:00,009
What are you saying?

1162
01:25:00,067 --> 01:25:01,910
Don't talk so loud.

1163
01:25:02,002 --> 01:25:04,482
Why did you have to choose that guy?

1164
01:25:07,374 --> 01:25:09,650
Did you say “that guy”?

1165
01:25:11,212 --> 01:25:13,158
You already know?

1166
01:25:13,214 --> 01:25:14,693
Know what?

1167
01:25:14,748 --> 01:25:16,659
You saw him with me?

1168
01:25:17,384 --> 01:25:18,886
Who? Where?

1169
01:25:21,689 --> 01:25:23,760
Right, right, right.

1170
01:25:23,858 --> 01:25:28,364
You're Mr. Detective. Of course.
How can you stoop so low?

1171
01:25:38,739 --> 01:25:41,379
Are you going to have kids?

1172
01:25:42,376 --> 01:25:44,253
Yes, we might.

1173
01:25:45,045 --> 01:25:47,025
That's why you're in such a rush.

1174
01:25:47,081 --> 01:25:49,425
<i>I am um 'm a rush. Dam be so mean.</i>

1175
01:25:49,516 --> 01:25:50,927
You're so calculating.

1176
01:25:51,018 --> 01:25:53,259
No. it's called planning your life.

1177
01:25:53,354 --> 01:25:54,731
Well, it's not love.

1178
01:25:54,788 --> 01:25:57,394
Grown-ups can't live on love alone.

1179
01:26:07,034 --> 01:26:08,877
Hey, what are you doing?

1180
01:26:08,936 --> 01:26:11,974
We're both adults. Why not?

1181
01:26:12,072 --> 01:26:14,109
Your mother's right there.

1182
01:26:14,208 --> 01:26:17,246
If Mom wasn't here, it would be okay?

1183
01:26:17,311 --> 01:26:19,587
Mom's trying to bring us back.

1184
01:26:24,285 --> 01:26:25,491
Wait.

1185
01:26:27,288 --> 01:26:30,735
Are you two in on this scheme?
You set this up from the beginning?

1186
01:26:30,791 --> 01:26:34,466
It wasn't like that.
Don't make it sound crude.

1187
01:26:35,963 --> 01:26:38,807
Mom, which one's my toothbrush?

1188
01:26:38,899 --> 01:26:39,934
I'll be right there.

1189
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,139
It's okay. I'll go.

1190
01:26:44,571 --> 01:26:47,484
More importantly, where's my 100,000 yen?

1191
01:26:47,574 --> 01:26:50,111
I'll pay. I'll pay, I'll pay.

1192
01:26:50,177 --> 01:26:51,520
You said it three times.

1193
01:26:53,080 --> 01:26:56,994
You always visit him and never pay.
This is your last visit.

1194
01:26:59,019 --> 01:27:00,498
Your towel, Shingo.

1195
01:27:00,587 --> 01:27:02,032
Thank you, Mother.

1196
01:27:02,122 --> 01:27:03,123
Happy to.

1197
01:27:03,190 --> 01:27:05,033
Dry off, Shingo.

1198
01:27:05,125 --> 01:27:07,765
I'm glad I bought some big towels.

1199
01:28:44,525 --> 01:28:48,302
TOO BAD!
YOUR SISTER

1200
01:30:14,314 --> 01:30:15,884
<i>The latest typhoon news.</i>

1201
01:30:15,983 --> 01:30:19,192
You're still up?

1202
01:30:19,286 --> 01:30:24,395
As you get older,
you fall asleep but not for long.

1203
01:30:26,894 --> 01:30:30,239
Ask your doctor for sleeping pills.

1204
01:30:30,330 --> 01:30:33,573
I have, and he prescribes sleeping pills
now and then.

1205
01:30:36,236 --> 01:30:38,182
That wind is fierce.

1206
01:30:39,173 --> 01:30:40,982
Something just flew by.

1207
01:30:42,075 --> 01:30:44,316
They said it'll blow over by morning.

1208
01:30:46,380 --> 01:30:48,360
I love typhoons.

1209
01:30:48,849 --> 01:30:50,851
They're so refreshing.

1210
01:30:52,486 --> 01:30:54,159
You're strange.

1211
01:30:55,556 --> 01:30:57,866
When we lived in that house in Nerima...

1212
01:30:58,492 --> 01:31:04,101
every time a typhoon came,
I worried it would tear the roof off.

1213
01:31:04,198 --> 01:31:06,940
At night, we packed up our things

1214
01:31:07,034 --> 01:31:11,449
and took shelter in the church
with the kindergarten.

1215
01:31:11,538 --> 01:31:12,915
Right.

1216
01:31:14,041 --> 01:31:16,214
I only ever saw the church during the day,

1217
01:31:16,276 --> 01:31:19,257
so the stained glass
looked extra beautiful.

1218
01:31:19,346 --> 01:31:21,451
When we moved in here,

1219
01:31:21,548 --> 01:31:25,928
I was so relieved I wouldn't have
to be afraid of typhoons anymore.

1220
01:31:28,055 --> 01:31:33,232
But I never imagined
I'd wind up living here 40 years.

1221
01:31:34,294 --> 01:31:37,707
I'm sorry I'm such a useless son.

1222
01:31:45,939 --> 01:31:47,782
I am going to die.

1223
01:31:50,444 --> 01:31:53,084
What? DOM talk like that. it's bad luck.

1224
01:31:53,146 --> 01:31:58,220
Luck has nothing to do with it.
I will definitely die someday.

1225
01:31:58,819 --> 01:32:00,992
And probably right here.

1226
01:32:02,889 --> 01:32:03,993
What?

1227
01:32:05,158 --> 01:32:06,398
Are you sick again?

1228
01:32:06,460 --> 01:32:08,303
No, I'm not.

1229
01:32:09,229 --> 01:32:10,435
Listen.

1230
01:32:11,131 --> 01:32:14,408
As I grow weaker and weaker,

1231
01:32:14,468 --> 01:32:17,347
I'll need you by my side
to take care of me.

1232
01:32:17,437 --> 01:32:19,576
That's not for me.

1233
01:32:19,640 --> 01:32:22,917
They say that it's easiest for the dying,

1234
01:32:22,976 --> 01:32:26,253
and for those left behind,
if you die in your sleep.

1235
01:32:27,014 --> 01:32:29,358
But that's not true.

1236
01:32:30,584 --> 01:32:31,756
It isn't?

1237
01:32:31,818 --> 01:32:33,798
That's how your father died.

1238
01:32:36,456 --> 01:32:38,993
But he shows up in my dreams.

1239
01:32:42,629 --> 01:32:44,666
You have dreams like that?

1240
01:32:44,765 --> 01:32:47,371
Every once in a while.

1241
01:32:47,834 --> 01:32:49,711
What do you dream?

1242
01:32:49,803 --> 01:32:51,874
He's always alive.

1243
01:32:52,506 --> 01:32:56,613
I feel like he's still alive, too.

1244
01:32:58,178 --> 01:33:00,055
Which is better?

1245
01:33:00,147 --> 01:33:04,118
To have me bedridden for years
and unable to die...

1246
01:33:05,018 --> 01:33:09,296
or to have me die quickly
but keep appearing in your dreams?

1247
01:33:09,856 --> 01:33:10,857
Neither.

1248
01:33:10,957 --> 01:33:13,733
Oh, no, you have to choose.

1249
01:33:15,662 --> 01:33:17,073
Which is it?

1250
01:33:17,698 --> 01:33:19,143
Bedridden, then.

1251
01:33:19,199 --> 01:33:21,076
“Final answer?”

1252
01:33:21,568 --> 01:33:24,981
That's such an old show. Yes.
“Final answer."

1253
01:33:27,007 --> 01:33:30,978
<i>The singer Teresa Teng
is known by her fans</i>

1254
01:33:31,044 --> 01:33:36,926
<i>for her songs “Atonement” and “Beloved.”</i>

1255
01:33:37,017 --> 01:33:39,258
<i>But my personal favorite
is “Wakare no Yokan.”</i>

1256
01:33:39,353 --> 01:33:43,927
I wonder what Dad really wanted.

1257
01:33:44,024 --> 01:33:45,196
From what?

1258
01:33:46,927 --> 01:33:48,770
From his life.

1259
01:33:48,862 --> 01:33:53,072
I never could figure him out,
to his final day.

1260
01:33:56,370 --> 01:33:58,611
His life didn't work out like he wanted.

1261
01:34:00,607 --> 01:34:02,109
So many things...

1262
01:34:03,176 --> 01:34:04,382
because of the times.

1263
01:34:04,444 --> 01:34:09,860
He blamed all his weaknesses
on the times we lived in.

1264
01:34:13,387 --> 01:34:15,628
Why are you so grave?

1265
01:34:18,725 --> 01:34:21,797
Do you think that the incense is your dad?

1266
01:34:25,232 --> 01:34:28,611
Missing him after he's gone
won't bring him back.

1267
01:34:29,069 --> 01:34:32,642
You have to deal with people
while they're alive.

1268
01:34:32,739 --> 01:34:34,309
I know that.

1269
01:34:36,143 --> 01:34:41,650
I wonder why it is
that men can't love the present.

1270
01:34:45,152 --> 01:34:48,224
Either they just keep chasing
whatever it is they've lost...

1271
01:34:48,955 --> 01:34:51,265
or they keep dreaming beyond their reach.

1272
01:34:51,758 --> 01:34:55,399
How can you enjoy life
if you keep doing that?

1273
01:34:58,298 --> 01:34:59,743
If you say so.

1274
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:02,910
You can't find happiness

1275
01:35:02,969 --> 01:35:08,976
until you've let go... of something.

1276
01:35:15,615 --> 01:35:19,757
<i>Even deeper than the sea</i>

1277
01:35:19,820 --> 01:35:24,599
<i>Even blue: than the sky</i>

1278
01:35:24,658 --> 01:35:30,336
I've never loved anyone
deeper than the sea...

1279
01:35:31,164 --> 01:35:33,974
even though I've made it to this age.

1280
01:35:35,035 --> 01:35:36,946
Don't sound so depressing.

1281
01:35:37,003 --> 01:35:38,505
Have you?

1282
01:35:39,439 --> 01:35:40,611
Me?

1283
01:35:43,677 --> 01:35:46,521
In my own way.

1284
01:35:46,613 --> 01:35:48,354
No, not most people.

1285
01:35:49,216 --> 01:35:52,527
But we still live our lives,
enjoying every day.

1286
01:35:52,619 --> 01:35:56,226
Actually, we keep on living
because we haven't.

1287
01:35:56,323 --> 01:35:58,394
So we manage to find joy

1288
01:35:58,492 --> 01:36:01,234
day after day.

1289
01:36:10,971 --> 01:36:12,575
That's complex.

1290
01:36:12,672 --> 01:36:16,415
No, it's simple. Life is simple.

1291
01:36:19,679 --> 01:36:24,992
I just said something really deep,
didn't I?

1292
01:36:25,051 --> 01:36:28,032
You can use ii in your next novel.

1293
01:36:30,891 --> 01:36:33,770
Write it down, or you'll forget it.

1294
01:36:33,860 --> 01:36:34,998
It's okay.

1295
01:36:35,061 --> 01:36:36,665
Where's the notepad?

1296
01:36:36,730 --> 01:36:38,835
I'll remember it.

1297
01:36:38,899 --> 01:36:40,173
Which pan?

1298
01:36:42,369 --> 01:36:44,679
“You can't find happiness'!-

1299
01:37:03,290 --> 01:37:04,928
The typhoon's still around?

1300
01:37:05,592 --> 01:37:06,593
Yeah.

1301
01:37:07,594 --> 01:37:08,868
It's intense.

1302
01:37:10,030 --> 01:37:13,102
The toilet? The light switch
is the middle one on the right.

1303
01:37:13,199 --> 01:37:14,439
I know.

1304
01:37:34,554 --> 01:37:35,965
Shall we go?

1305
01:37:36,990 --> 01:37:38,435
To the water tower?

1306
01:37:38,491 --> 01:37:39,902
No, the park.

1307
01:37:47,133 --> 01:37:51,138
Rice crackers, cookies, candy.

1308
01:37:51,237 --> 01:37:54,241
A feast. We'll get drinks there.

1309
01:38:06,319 --> 01:38:09,493
They're not climbing up the tower,
are they?

1310
01:38:09,589 --> 01:38:13,435
I think they're going to the park.
They mentioned the slides.

1311
01:38:13,493 --> 01:38:15,996
They'll be fine, then.

1312
01:38:28,308 --> 01:38:30,652
I'm sorry to ask you at this hour.

1313
01:38:30,710 --> 01:38:33,657
I'm wide-awake anyway.

1314
01:38:34,381 --> 01:38:36,224
Would you like a snack?

1315
01:38:36,316 --> 01:38:37,989
No, I'm fine.

1316
01:38:39,185 --> 01:38:43,861
I'll make some coffee, then.
I just hope you aren't picky.

1317
01:38:43,957 --> 01:38:46,494
It's late. I'm really fine.

1318
01:38:48,561 --> 01:38:50,541
You're right.

1319
01:38:56,870 --> 01:39:01,410
You have such beautiful handwriting.
I envy you.

1320
01:39:01,508 --> 01:39:03,215
You're too kind.

1321
01:39:03,309 --> 01:39:05,482
Your mother had good handwriting, too?

1322
01:39:05,545 --> 01:39:08,651
Yes. She was a calligraphy teacher.

1323
01:39:10,250 --> 01:39:13,231
If I had been a little smarter...

1324
01:39:13,319 --> 01:39:16,357
I wanted to be a home economics teacher.

1325
01:39:16,423 --> 01:39:18,494
I studied teaching, too.

1326
01:39:18,558 --> 01:39:20,595
What a coincidence. What subject?

1327
01:39:20,694 --> 01:39:23,766
Language.
I even did some practice teaching.

1328
01:39:35,408 --> 01:39:39,857
You make me nervous
staring at me like that.

1329
01:39:43,750 --> 01:39:45,889
I just wonder...

1330
01:39:46,519 --> 01:39:49,261
if the two of you are completely over.

1331
01:39:59,299 --> 01:40:04,248
You treat me like your own daughter...

1332
01:40:04,904 --> 01:40:06,906
and I really appreciate that.

1333
01:40:08,742 --> 01:40:12,781
But Ryota isn't cut out to have a family.

1334
01:40:15,315 --> 01:40:18,558
I hoped having a baby would change him.

1335
01:40:18,618 --> 01:40:22,566
In that sense,
he turned out just like his father.

1336
01:40:22,622 --> 01:40:23,464
I'm sorry.

1337
01:40:23,556 --> 01:40:26,264
No, I owe you the apology.

1338
01:40:26,326 --> 01:40:30,968
The subject is closed.

1339
01:40:33,800 --> 01:40:37,338
So, no more sushi parties.

1340
01:40:37,437 --> 01:40:39,417
No, let's have another one.

1341
01:40:40,440 --> 01:40:44,513
Can we? Let's go to a sushi place where
they don't serve it on a conveyor belt.

1342
01:40:44,611 --> 01:40:46,955
Yes. Next time, it's my treat.

1343
01:40:47,013 --> 01:40:48,788
That makes me so happy.

1344
01:40:54,154 --> 01:40:55,531
This.

1345
01:41:02,428 --> 01:41:03,771
His umbilical cord.

1346
01:41:03,830 --> 01:41:04,831
SHINGO

1347
01:41:04,931 --> 01:41:07,605
I kept it after we took him
on his first shrine visit.

1348
01:41:07,667 --> 01:41:09,271
You're right.

1349
01:41:17,377 --> 01:41:21,951
From now on, you should keep it.

1350
01:41:27,987 --> 01:41:29,057
I will.

1351
01:41:31,324 --> 01:41:34,396
I really just can't...

1352
01:41:36,563 --> 01:41:40,306
understand
why things turned out like this.

1353
01:41:46,973 --> 01:41:50,182
And look at his terrible handwriting.

1354
01:41:51,077 --> 01:41:53,523
We should have asked his father
to write it.

1355
01:41:55,014 --> 01:41:58,587
He only inherited my bad handwriting.

1356
01:42:14,901 --> 01:42:16,437
Something just flew by.

1357
01:42:17,837 --> 01:42:19,407
A plastic bag?

1358
01:42:19,505 --> 01:42:21,007
An umbrella.

1359
01:42:23,409 --> 01:42:24,547
Someone's there.

1360
01:42:24,611 --> 01:42:25,885
Really?

1361
01:42:26,779 --> 01:42:28,258
Just kidding.

1362
01:42:28,348 --> 01:42:29,452
Whatever.

1363
01:42:30,917 --> 01:42:32,123
Time for a snack?

1364
01:42:32,218 --> 01:42:33,219
Yes.

1365
01:42:33,887 --> 01:42:35,889
DISCOUNTED RICE CRACKERS

1366
01:42:47,066 --> 01:42:48,602
A little stale.

1367
01:42:49,535 --> 01:42:50,775
But still tasty.

1368
01:42:54,073 --> 01:42:57,247
Shingo, do you remember your grandpa?

1369
01:42:57,810 --> 01:43:00,290
Yeah. He was nice to me.

1370
01:43:03,650 --> 01:43:06,631
But you didn't like him, right?

1371
01:43:07,720 --> 01:43:08,892
Why?

1372
01:43:09,489 --> 01:43:12,299
That's what Grandpa told me.

1373
01:43:14,060 --> 01:43:15,630
That's not true.

1374
01:43:17,330 --> 01:43:18,775
It's just that...

1375
01:43:19,832 --> 01:43:22,142
we had a fight.

1376
01:43:22,802 --> 01:43:24,179
Why?

1377
01:43:26,072 --> 01:43:27,346
Because...

1378
01:43:28,308 --> 01:43:30,686
Probably because I became a novelist.

1379
01:43:37,517 --> 01:43:40,464
Shingo, what do you want to be
when you grow up?

1380
01:43:42,689 --> 01:43:43,963
A civil servant.

1381
01:43:45,091 --> 01:43:46,798
Not a professional baseball player?

1382
01:43:47,593 --> 01:43:49,595
I could never be that.

1383
01:43:49,662 --> 01:43:50,834
Why not?

1384
01:43:52,198 --> 01:43:54,542
You don't know if you don't try.

1385
01:43:54,634 --> 01:43:56,045
I'm sure.

1386
01:43:59,839 --> 01:44:02,046
What did you want to be?

1387
01:44:04,277 --> 01:44:06,188
Are you who you wanted to be?

1388
01:44:10,817 --> 01:44:12,455
I'm not...

1389
01:44:13,453 --> 01:44:15,057
who I want to be yet.

1390
01:44:16,789 --> 01:44:18,200
But, you know...

1391
01:44:19,792 --> 01:44:22,204
it doesn't matter whether
I've become what I wanted.

1392
01:44:22,295 --> 01:44:23,672
What matters...

1393
01:44:24,364 --> 01:44:28,335
is to live my life
trying to become what I want to be.

1394
01:44:32,305 --> 01:44:33,409
Is that true?

1395
01:44:35,808 --> 01:44:37,253
It's true.

1396
01:44:37,844 --> 01:44:39,050
It's true, it's true.

1397
01:44:44,684 --> 01:44:46,027
It's true.

1398
01:44:46,853 --> 01:44:49,595
Shingo, are you in there?

1399
01:44:49,689 --> 01:44:50,929
It's Mom.

1400
01:44:56,562 --> 01:44:58,940
What are you doing?

1401
01:44:59,766 --> 01:45:02,713
Come on in, Mom. You'll be dry in here.

1402
01:45:02,769 --> 01:45:04,043
Come on in.

1403
01:45:09,175 --> 01:45:12,122
My favorite umbrella ruined.

1404
01:45:12,211 --> 01:45:14,919
Let's go back. Grandma's worried.

1405
01:45:15,014 --> 01:45:17,517
So soon?

1406
01:45:23,389 --> 01:45:25,426
This isn't how
it was supposed to turn out.

1407
01:45:26,692 --> 01:45:27,898
That's right.

1408
01:45:28,728 --> 01:45:31,072
We were supposed to go right home.

1409
01:45:31,130 --> 01:45:34,304
That's not what I'm talking about.

1410
01:45:38,471 --> 01:45:40,075
It's really true.

1411
01:45:42,308 --> 01:45:44,652
This isn't how
it was supposed to turn out.

1412
01:45:48,648 --> 01:45:50,093
Don't fall.

1413
01:45:51,984 --> 01:45:53,964
I already made up my mind.

1414
01:45:55,955 --> 01:45:58,094
Let us move on.

1415
01:46:04,330 --> 01:46:05,832
Do you understand?

1416
01:46:10,770 --> 01:46:12,181
I understand.

1417
01:46:16,642 --> 01:46:18,451
I always understood.

1418
01:46:26,519 --> 01:46:29,625
Coffee at this hour
will keep you up all night.

1419
01:46:29,689 --> 01:46:31,259
I won't sleep anyway.

1420
01:46:31,324 --> 01:46:34,533
That's not good for you.
You're still a child.

1421
01:46:34,994 --> 01:46:36,473
Not fair.

1422
01:46:37,196 --> 01:46:39,699
Sometimes I'm a kid,
sometimes I'm a grown-up.

1423
01:46:40,600 --> 01:46:42,602
When did I say you're a grown-up?

1424
01:46:42,668 --> 01:46:44,670
The other day, you said to me,

1425
01:46:44,770 --> 01:46:48,980
“You're not a child anymore.
Pretend to enjoy yourself."

1426
01:46:49,041 --> 01:46:50,884
After your date.

1427
01:46:50,977 --> 01:46:52,718
That's confusing, isn't it?

1428
01:46:52,812 --> 01:46:54,348
You shut up.

1429
01:46:54,447 --> 01:46:56,893
Did you have to bring that up now?

1430
01:46:58,818 --> 01:46:59,956
What's wrong?

1431
01:47:01,154 --> 01:47:03,532
I cant find my lottery tickets.

1432
01:47:06,292 --> 01:47:07,498
Maybe I dropped them.

1433
01:47:07,560 --> 01:47:10,040
Just forget about them.

1434
01:47:10,129 --> 01:47:11,733
They're for 300 million yen.

1435
01:47:12,398 --> 01:47:15,572
Cut it out!
You're not going to win anyway!

1436
01:47:16,035 --> 01:47:18,811
Silly you.
You always win at least 300 yen.

1437
01:47:18,871 --> 01:47:20,748
What? Really?

1438
01:47:23,809 --> 01:47:25,220
Find them?

1439
01:47:25,811 --> 01:47:27,381
Found one!

1440
01:47:45,231 --> 01:47:46,539
How many, Shingo?

1441
01:47:47,400 --> 01:47:48,538
Two.

1442
01:47:48,601 --> 01:47:50,672
Two down.

1443
01:47:50,736 --> 01:47:52,875
- Kyoko?
- Found one.

1444
01:47:54,340 --> 01:47:55,717
Four more!

1445
01:48:21,267 --> 01:48:26,876
<i>Typhoon Number 24 has headed north
and is now over Hokkaido.</i>

1446
01:48:26,939 --> 01:48:32,821
<i>More than 120 people
were injured across the nation,</i>

1447
01:48:32,912 --> 01:48:36,724
<i>and public transportation
was impacted as well.</i>

1448
01:48:37,550 --> 01:48:41,726
<i>Al 9:30 p.m. last night, the river in...</i>

1449
01:48:41,787 --> 01:48:45,325
See? You were right to spend the night.

1450
01:48:45,424 --> 01:48:47,335
Yes, we were.

1451
01:49:02,775 --> 01:49:04,311
Here.

1452
01:49:04,410 --> 01:49:05,514
What's that?

1453
01:49:05,611 --> 01:49:06,783
It was your father's.

1454
01:49:06,846 --> 01:49:10,453
Your shirt hasn't dried yet.
Wear this instead.

1455
01:49:10,516 --> 01:49:13,326
I thought you threw them all out.

1456
01:49:14,020 --> 01:49:17,968
It's just this one I forgot to throw out.

1457
01:49:19,792 --> 01:49:22,602
It might be a little small for you, but...

1458
01:49:23,095 --> 01:49:24,768
It will look good on you.

1459
01:49:25,264 --> 01:49:27,301
- Seconds'?
- Yes, please.

1460
01:50:07,506 --> 01:50:09,816
I thought it was a lottery ticket.

1461
01:50:17,817 --> 01:50:19,262
Look. It's Grandma.

1462
01:50:38,003 --> 01:50:41,212
Time to get back to work.

1463
01:50:46,212 --> 01:50:47,885
This is worth...

1464
01:50:48,781 --> 01:50:50,454
300,000 yen.

1465
01:50:58,190 --> 01:50:59,965
It's a fine inkstone.

1466
01:51:00,860 --> 01:51:03,272
Dear, could you bring that here?

1467
01:51:03,362 --> 01:51:04,636
Coming.

1468
01:51:08,200 --> 01:51:11,079
Your father gave it to me.

1469
01:51:11,904 --> 01:51:15,647
He said, “It's a first edition
that will be worth a lot someday.”

1470
01:51:15,741 --> 01:51:18,449
- My old man?
- Yeah. He must've been so proud.

1471
01:51:18,544 --> 01:51:20,455
THE EMPTY TABLE

1472
01:51:20,546 --> 01:51:24,426
I heard he handed out free copies
to all the neighborhood shops.

1473
01:51:25,451 --> 01:51:27,089
Dear, let's ask him.

1474
01:51:27,153 --> 01:51:28,393
You're right.

1475
01:51:28,454 --> 01:51:32,163
Could you autograph your book
with this ink and brush?

1476
01:51:32,992 --> 01:51:34,266
Sure.

1477
01:51:36,729 --> 01:51:39,767
You've got yourself a fine son.

1478
01:52:08,661 --> 01:52:09,935
Dad's here.

1479
01:52:09,995 --> 01:52:11,474
He's here?

1480
01:52:13,365 --> 01:52:15,538
Sorry to keep you waiting.

1481
01:52:38,224 --> 01:52:40,226
The lottery tickets are all yours.

1482
01:52:41,961 --> 01:52:43,065
Really?

1483
01:52:43,662 --> 01:52:44,834
Yeah.

1484
01:53:04,683 --> 01:53:07,163
See you here again next month.

1485
01:53:08,821 --> 01:53:12,030
And you can pay me 150,000 yen...
Three months' worth.

1486
01:53:13,492 --> 01:53:14,903
Don't worry.

1487
01:53:15,995 --> 01:53:17,406
Take care, Shingo.

1488
01:53:17,496 --> 01:53:18,873
See you.

1489
01:53:19,532 --> 01:53:20,909
Bye, then.

1490
01:53:29,608 --> 01:53:31,451
Let me carry the cleats.

1491
01:53:34,847 --> 01:53:38,090
At your next game, hit a home run.
No walks.

1492
01:53:38,183 --> 01:53:39,787
I like drawing walks.

1493
01:53:40,386 --> 01:53:41,797
You do?

1494
01:54:03,475 --> 01:54:09,892
<i>What kind of future was I dreaming of?</i>

1495
01:54:10,316 --> 01:54:17,894
<i>So long to myself from yesterday</i>

1496
01:54:17,957 --> 01:54:24,465
<i>I look above
and see a vapor trail streaking by</i>

1497
01:54:24,563 --> 01:54:28,670
<i>Where should I go home to?</i>

1498
01:54:35,341 --> 01:54:41,815
<i>Maybe I haven't lost a thing at all</i>

1499
01:54:41,914 --> 01:54:49,492
<i>So long to myself from yesterday</i>

1500
01:54:49,588 --> 01:54:56,096
<i>I close my eyes and call out</i>

1501
01:54:56,528 --> 01:55:01,170
<i>I see your face from days long past!</i>

1502
01:55:03,669 --> 01:55:10,052
<i>Hey, hey, I still remember you</i>

1503
01:55:10,709 --> 01:55:17,649
<i>Hey, hey, HI never forge! you</i>

1504
01:55:17,716 --> 01:55:24,065
<i>I thought
I heard someone cal! out my name</i>

1505
01:55:24,156 --> 01:55:29,299
<i>I turn around, bu! you're not there</i>

1506
01:55:31,664 --> 01:55:37,979
<i>Hey, hey, I still remember you</i>

1507
01:55:38,671 --> 01:55:45,020
<i>Hey, hey, HI never forge! you</i>

1508
01:55:45,544 --> 01:55:51,859
<i>Hey, hey, even in times</i>

1509
01:55:53,652 --> 01:55:57,099
<i>When I couldn't believe in myself</i>

1510
01:55:59,258 --> 01:56:05,004
<i>You were the only one</i>

1511
01:56:05,831 --> 01:56:11,076
<i>Who believed in me</i>

1512
01:56:13,272 --> 01:56:19,882
<i>What kind of future was I dreaming of?</i>

1513
01:56:19,945 --> 01:56:27,363
<i>Hello again lo myself of tomorrow</i>

1514
01:56:27,419 --> 01:56:33,893
<i>I won 't be able to let myself go</i>

1515
01:56:33,959 --> 01:56:38,203
<i>So I'll take another step forward</i>

1516
01:56:39,198 --> 01:56:43,578
<i>Another step forward</i>

1517
01:56:44,436 --> 01:56:50,318
<i>Just one more step forward</i>
