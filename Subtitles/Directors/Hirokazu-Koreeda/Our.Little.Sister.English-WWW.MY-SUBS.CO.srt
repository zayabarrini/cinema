1
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:45,272
A work call so early?

2
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:48,525
But it's no big deal.

3
00:01:49,527 --> 00:01:52,196
Sorry we can't eat together.

4
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:56,283
I'll pay you back
when my temp job pays.

5
00:01:57,952 --> 00:01:59,578
There's no rush.

6
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:29,191
OUR LITTLE SISTER

7
00:02:56,427 --> 00:02:58,888
- Welcome home.
- How's our big sister?

8
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:01,515
I don't think Sachi slept much
last night.

9
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:05,060
You should let us know
when you're staying over.

10
00:03:05,186 --> 00:03:08,147
- It just sort of happened.
- "Happened"?

11
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:11,942
Some things just happen
to grown-ups.

12
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:14,278
- Thanks for the lesson.
- You're late!

13
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:17,531
Why are you always late
when it really matters?

14
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:19,533
Do you understand?

15
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:21,285
Yes, yes, yes!

16
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:25,581
Chika! Time to get up.

17
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:32,504
In Yamagata?

18
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:35,174
Apparently Dad worked
in a hot springs hotel.

19
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:38,427
Kind of sounds
like a made-for TV movie.

20
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:39,929
Exactly!

21
00:03:40,054 --> 00:03:42,514
"Murder in the Secluded Hot Springs,"
right?

22
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,059
Nobody killed him.

23
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:48,103
Was it "that woman" who called?

24
00:03:49,063 --> 00:03:51,357
Apparently "that woman" died.

25
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:55,069
Chika! Don't shovel your food.

26
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:59,114
So, he was living in Yamagata
with his current wife.

27
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,826
His third wife? Wow!

28
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,496
You'll get high blood pressure
just like Grandma.

29
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:07,790
But your pickles don't taste salty.

30
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:09,833
They're not supposed to.

31
00:04:11,377 --> 00:04:14,088
Apparently,
he left behind a daughter.

32
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,091
Meaning, our little sister?

33
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:18,592
I guess so.

34
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:20,511
What about Dad's funeral?

35
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,472
I can't go because of work.

36
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:26,183
Really? It's no big deal.

37
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:30,646
You could go, couldn't you?
And take Chika with you.

38
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:56,547
I am not looking forward to this.

39
00:04:56,672 --> 00:04:59,550
He was our dad,
but I hadn't seen him in 15 years.

40
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:04,054
Dad was kind, right?

41
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,183
He used to take us to the zoo.

42
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:13,188
But they used to fight a lot at night.

43
00:05:14,273 --> 00:05:18,152
I remember seeing
Sachi comforting Mum so many times.

44
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:21,071
I hardly remember him at all.

45
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,532
You were still little.

46
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:30,289
- A little sister...
- You always said you wanted one.

47
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:34,376
That was when I was little!
It's a little late for that now.

48
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,380
I know...

49
00:05:47,306 --> 00:05:50,017
Why did he move here,
of all places?

50
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:51,810
Eh? What?

51
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:55,898
I said, this is the middle
of nowhere.

52
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,112
Are you the Kodas?

53
00:06:03,489 --> 00:06:06,784
I'm Asano Suzu.

54
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:11,455
So, you're...

55
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,376
I'm grateful for you coming
all this way.

56
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:20,798
It's a little steep,
but it's a shortcut.

57
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:27,346
- It's like a mountain!
- I know.

58
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:42,403
It's there.

59
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:49,368
She said that's it.

60
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:52,162
Wow, it's fancy.

61
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,170
We're here.

62
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:04,049
Welcome.
Thank you for coming so far.

63
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:06,093
Thank you for having us.

64
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,637
Thank you.

65
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:12,683
My mother will come
and see you later.

66
00:07:16,854 --> 00:07:19,523
Thanks for coming to the station.

67
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:21,108
Thanks.

68
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:26,405
She's mature for her age.

69
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,741
More than us, eh?

70
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:31,243
This way, please.

71
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:33,287
Oh, it's cool.

72
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:44,465
Beer!

73
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:49,094
- I want a beer!
- It's so pretty! The river's right below.

74
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:53,724
- I wonder if you can fish here.
- Just give me a beer.

75
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:09,364
Are you all right, Yoko-san?

76
00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:20,751
Hush now!

77
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:54,368
- You made it.
- After working all night?

78
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:56,703
A friend drove me here.

79
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,790
That's the girl?

80
00:09:07,673 --> 00:09:10,634
Hello, I'm Koda Sachi.

81
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:13,095
I'm Asano Suzu.

82
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,682
Your little brother?

83
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:20,227
Yes, but he's my stepmother's son.

84
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:21,603
I see.

85
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,439
Excuse me.

86
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:29,319
Hello, I'm Koda.

87
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:31,989
- Are you the oldest daughter?
- Yes.

88
00:09:32,114 --> 00:09:35,659
Hello, I'm Asano's wife.

89
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:38,495
Thank you for joining us,
I know you're busy.

90
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:43,417
- Thank you for caring for my father.
- Not at all.

91
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:47,629
It was your father
who looked after me.

92
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:51,883
Before the funeral procession
can begin,

93
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:55,971
you need to address the guests.

94
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:01,310
Can you manage that?

95
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:03,145
I can't...

96
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:06,023
Please do it for me, Uncle.

97
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:08,984
But then again...

98
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:15,073
How about Suzu-chan?

99
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:19,328
Yes, that's a good idea.
She's his daughter, after all.

100
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:21,413
That's not the right thing.

101
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:24,249
But she's very mature.

102
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:27,252
Suzu-chan will manage just fine.
She's smart.

103
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:30,714
No, this is a grown-up's job.

104
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:37,971
If you want, shall I do it?

105
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:40,182
Just address the guests?

106
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:44,853
I understand.

107
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:47,898
I'll do it.

108
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:50,692
Can you manage, Yoko?

109
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:54,696
I can manage, Uncle. I'm his wife.

110
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:05,707
Oh, look at the smoke.

111
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:08,627
You're right.

112
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:15,092
Smoke from a crematorium
is so old-fashioned.

113
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:25,477
Dad must've been happy here.

114
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:28,146
So many people came to see him off.

115
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:33,110
Everyone mentioned
how kind he was.

116
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:38,156
He was kind and useless.

117
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:44,788
He guaranteed a friend's loan
and went into debt.

118
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:49,501
He sympathised with women
and started affairs.

119
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:06,768
His widow, Yoko, is a lot
like our mother, isn't she?

120
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:13,734
But she nursed him until the end.
We should be thankful.

121
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:15,360
You're right.

122
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:19,406
I'm sure she barely visited him
in the hospital.

123
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:25,078
I bet she stayed 10 minutes at most,
after delivering his clean clothes.

124
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:28,707
But in her mind,
that's attentive nursing.

125
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:31,334
- Only a skilled nurse knows...
- Excuse me!

126
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:37,340
- What is it?
- I have something for you.

127
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:44,347
This...
I found it in Father's desk.

128
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:55,901
Is that you, sis?

129
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:01,531
The fireworks at Kamakura.

130
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:03,909
Oh, I remember this trip
to Enoshima.

131
00:13:04,034 --> 00:13:07,454
Chika, you got lost on this trip
and caused such a fuss.

132
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:09,790
You even pooped
at the visitor centre.

133
00:13:09,915 --> 00:13:11,625
Really, did I?

134
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,669
Goodbye, then.

135
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:19,549
Wait.

136
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:22,385
Do you have time?

137
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:25,555
Yes.

138
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,684
Where's your favourite place
in this town?

139
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:39,861
I wonder if the kid'll be all right.

140
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:45,283
I just wonder if she'll make it here.

141
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:51,081
She's unrelated to Yoko.

142
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:09,516
What a beautiful view.

143
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:17,107
I came here often with Father.

144
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:24,447
Doesn't it look similar?

145
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,327
It looks just like our Kamakura
without the ocean.

146
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:32,789
Right? It brings back memories.

147
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:40,297
Suzu-chan...

148
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:45,677
You're the one
who nursed Father, right?

149
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:59,816
I'm sure he's grateful to you.

150
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:06,573
Thank you so much.

151
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:16,124
Thank you.

152
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,709
Thank you.

153
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:49,366
Do you like it here?

154
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:56,039
I'm not sure,
I haven't lived here that long.

155
00:15:57,082 --> 00:15:58,541
That's right.

156
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:08,843
But now I understand
why Father wanted to live here

157
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,391
Here it is.

158
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:50,135
- See you.
- Take care.

159
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,971
Yes. You, too, sisters.

160
00:16:55,557 --> 00:16:58,977
Suzu-chan,
why don't you come to Kamakura?

161
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:02,981
We could live together,
the four of us.

162
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:09,279
Our house is really old, but it's huge.

163
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:12,449
We all have jobs,
so we can take care of you.

164
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:16,494
But...

165
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,831
You don't have to answer
right away.

166
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:23,084
- Think it over.
- See you again.

167
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,090
I'll come!

168
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:19,974
Hey, sis, she's here!

169
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,351
OK!

170
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:23,269
Watch your step there.

171
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:33,029
Welcome!

172
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:35,990
- Are you tired from the long trip?
- I'm fine.

173
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:38,368
Your room's upstairs.
Put your things up there.

174
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:43,081
- You're next to me.
- Thank you for welcoming me.

175
00:18:43,206 --> 00:18:44,541
Come on.

176
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:47,377
- Thank you.
- This way, this way.

177
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:51,798
- Yoshino, help me fix lunch.
- We're not ordering out?

178
00:18:51,923 --> 00:18:53,758
Noodles should be home-cooked.

179
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:56,386
Lotus root and eggplant tempura,
please.

180
00:18:56,511 --> 00:18:58,346
- I have eggplant.
- Great.

181
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:00,640
I'll help.

182
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:05,061
You should unpack your things, Suzu.
You're the only one who can.

183
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:11,442
You're our little sister now,
no more Suzu-"chan".

184
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:12,902
OK.

185
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:24,581
Yotchan's room is at the back.
This used to be Sachi's room.

186
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:32,714
It's a little small,
but it faces south.

187
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:45,185
I wonder if the desk'll fit.
So many tight corners in this house.

188
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:56,613
Suzu?

189
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:07,332
That's Grandma and Grandpa.
They were both teachers.

190
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:26,351
She looks like Sachi-san.

191
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:30,146
Don't tell her.
She hates being told that.

192
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:31,481
Oh, really?

193
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:35,652
Every time she argued with Mum,
that's what Mum told her.

194
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:39,864
- Hello!
- Oh, he's here.

195
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:45,328
We're done moving.

196
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:54,254
It's hot!

197
00:20:55,338 --> 00:20:56,547
Hot!

198
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:58,717
He's the manager
at Max's Sportswear.

199
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:00,885
Are they dating?

200
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:03,096
I don't want to think about it.

201
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,891
I can't figure out her taste in men.

202
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:12,355
Oh, the Junior Soccer team?

203
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,233
Yes, when we lived in Sendai.

204
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:19,529
You should try out for The Octopus.

205
00:21:21,656 --> 00:21:25,743
It's our local boys' soccer team.
Girls can join from Year 9.

206
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:28,913
We're fans.

207
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:31,332
More fresh cooked noodles.

208
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:35,712
Thank you so much.
I didn't help out at all.

209
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:38,756
Not at all.
You look out for Chika.

210
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:41,926
Your pickles are so good.

211
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:45,555
- Are they salty enough?
- Yes, they're perfect.

212
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:48,808
Did you play soccer?

213
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:51,102
Just a little mountain climbing.

214
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:56,232
More than a little. He was part
of the Manaslu Expedition 7 years ago.

215
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:57,942
Wow, really?

216
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:02,405
But after that,
I got lost on Mount Everest.

217
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:05,450
I lost six of my toes.

218
00:22:05,575 --> 00:22:09,954
- Six toes?
- Want to see?

219
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:11,122
No, thank you.

220
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:14,125
Want to take a look?
You can touch them, too.

221
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:17,128
Take a picture?

222
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:18,421
No, thanks.

223
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,762
Take your seats.

224
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:28,097
Sit down!

225
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:34,437
I'm Asano Suzu,
transferring from Yamagata.

226
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:36,647
Nice to meet you.

227
00:22:36,773 --> 00:22:38,524
Applause!

228
00:22:39,484 --> 00:22:41,444
Take your seat.

229
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:45,823
Yamagata is in the northeast.

230
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:48,242
Do you know
where it is on the map?

231
00:22:48,368 --> 00:22:52,497
You can ask her yourselves
about the town she moved from.

232
00:22:52,622 --> 00:22:55,583
Teach her all about
how we live here.

233
00:22:56,584 --> 00:22:59,504
- What clubs were you in?
- I played soccer.

234
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:01,964
- Soccer? Cool.
- So cool.

235
00:23:03,174 --> 00:23:05,343
- I play basketball.
- Me, too.

236
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:09,639
Asano...

237
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:13,351
Mr Hamada told me to give you
the Octopus team application.

238
00:23:13,476 --> 00:23:17,313
Fill in your parent's name
and get their signature.

239
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:19,857
I only have my older sisters.
Is that OK?

240
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:21,692
That's totally fine.

241
00:23:21,818 --> 00:23:23,528
- Great, thank you.
- Sure.

242
00:23:25,238 --> 00:23:26,364
Signing up?

243
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:28,658
If I pass the admission test.

244
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:33,371
They look tasty.

245
00:23:33,496 --> 00:23:36,833
She's not a pet, you know.

246
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:38,543
I know that, Great Auntie.

247
00:23:38,668 --> 00:23:40,878
Did you talk to your mother?

248
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:44,006
No, why should I?

249
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,259
Yes, well,

250
00:23:46,384 --> 00:23:50,263
if my older sister was still alive,
I'm sure she'd have said the same thing.

251
00:23:50,388 --> 00:23:53,516
I don't want to repeat myself,

252
00:23:53,641 --> 00:23:56,978
but it's a lot of work
to raise a child.

253
00:23:57,103 --> 00:24:01,983
I'll be fine.
I looked after Yoshino and Chika.

254
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:05,570
Sachi, you should really
think about it.

255
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:08,906
She may be your little sister,

256
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:13,953
but she's the daughter of the woman
who destroyed your family.

257
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:18,833
That doesn't matter.
She wasn't even born then.

258
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:26,674
At this rate, you'll never
get married and move out.

259
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:37,894
You're slow, Masashi.
Let go of the ball!

260
00:24:40,021 --> 00:24:41,481
Nice intercept!

261
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:46,152
Here!

262
00:24:50,698 --> 00:24:54,327
It's outside the post, Futa.
Switch it out!

263
00:24:54,452 --> 00:24:55,995
- Sorry!
- Don't worry.

264
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,997
Nice pass, Asano.

265
00:24:58,122 --> 00:25:00,458
She saw where that pass was going.

266
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:02,543
She uses both legs.

267
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:04,545
She's great.

268
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:07,173
THE SEAGULL CAFE

269
00:25:12,053 --> 00:25:15,723
Balancing body weight.
This is how Neymar does it.

270
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:17,391
Who's this, then?

271
00:25:22,772 --> 00:25:24,690
- Zidane!
- Right!

272
00:25:27,944 --> 00:25:32,740
Futa's the captain. His family is
all boys, he has two brothers.

273
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:34,450
I kind of thought so.

274
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:39,163
The coach, Yasu, works
at the hospital like Sachi.

275
00:25:40,748 --> 00:25:44,335
- So he's a doctor?
- Something like that.

276
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:47,004
Fried mackerel
for getting on the team.

277
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:48,631
It looks delicious.

278
00:25:48,756 --> 00:25:52,009
This is Mrs Ninomiya.
She's always looked after us.

279
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:54,554
Since they were tiny kids.

280
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:57,640
Eat your fill, OK?

281
00:25:57,765 --> 00:25:59,433
Thank you so much.

282
00:25:59,976 --> 00:26:02,562
It looks so tasty.
Thanks for the food.

283
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:11,320
- The new team member?
- Sachi's sister.

284
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:17,368
There's definitely
a family resemblance.

285
00:26:21,664 --> 00:26:23,541
- Delicious!
- Right?

286
00:26:44,854 --> 00:26:46,063
Hi.

287
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:51,402
So your little sister's moved in?

288
00:26:54,697 --> 00:26:59,619
That's a bold move.
But typical of you.

289
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:04,415
I'm glad I went to the funeral.

290
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:07,501
Otherwise,
I wouldn't have met my sister.

291
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:11,547
It's good to listen to friendly advice
occasionally.

292
00:27:14,425 --> 00:27:15,676
Thanks.

293
00:27:20,473 --> 00:27:23,100
When's your next night off?
How about dinner?

294
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:25,645
Yes, I'll check the shift roster.

295
00:27:33,694 --> 00:27:36,072
You seem a little tired lately.

296
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:40,201
My part-time job keeps me busy.

297
00:27:41,452 --> 00:27:43,954
- But how's your little sister?
- Meaning?

298
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,915
Isn't it tough?

299
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:49,085
She's just your half-sister, right?

300
00:27:50,503 --> 00:27:53,464
But she has such an open heart.

301
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:57,343
- I bet she's just acting that way.
- Why?

302
00:27:57,468 --> 00:28:00,429
Sorry for the wait.
Your rice croquettes.

303
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:06,185
You decided to renounce
the inheritance, right?

304
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:08,771
That's what Sachi decided.

305
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:13,943
And with you taking care of Suzu,
the widow's got it made.

306
00:28:14,694 --> 00:28:17,988
But that was Suzu's decision.

307
00:28:18,114 --> 00:28:20,825
Maybe the widow coached her.

308
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:22,743
No way!

309
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:26,122
You only see the bright side.

310
00:28:28,249 --> 00:28:30,292
It's a huge house.

311
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:32,837
But it's so old and creaky.

312
00:28:32,962 --> 00:28:35,047
Summers are fine
but winters are cold.

313
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:39,969
- And there are no locks on the doors.
- For real? Unbelievable.

314
00:28:40,094 --> 00:28:42,638
It's like a girls' dormitory.

315
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:46,809
- Yoshino?
- Oh, welcome home.

316
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:50,062
- I just got back.
- The "dorm matron".

317
00:28:50,187 --> 00:28:53,190
- This is my older sister.
- Hello, I'm Fujii.

318
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:55,484
Hello, thanks for looking
after my sister.

319
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:57,528
Not at all.

320
00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:59,280
- See you.
- See you again.

321
00:28:59,947 --> 00:29:01,699
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

322
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,868
Goodnight. Bye.

323
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:14,670
What's that face for?

324
00:29:15,713 --> 00:29:18,883
- He's decent compared to your exes.
- What do you mean, decent?

325
00:29:19,008 --> 00:29:21,594
That sounds like
I only date useless men.

326
00:29:21,719 --> 00:29:23,179
That's not what I'm saying.

327
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:29,435
- Meaning what, then?
- That you indulge men and ruin them.

328
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,520
What do you mean, "indulge"?

329
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:33,439
Giving them money, paying for dates.

330
00:29:33,564 --> 00:29:34,899
- Welcome home.
- Hi.

331
00:29:35,024 --> 00:29:38,569
How I spend the money I make
is none of your business!

332
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:42,990
Then stop getting drunk and going crazy
because some bar host dumped you.

333
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:48,204
- You have no idea why some of us drink.
- I have no wish to know.

334
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:51,207
She pisses me off.

335
00:29:51,332 --> 00:29:53,501
I'll take my bath first,
for two hours!

336
00:29:53,626 --> 00:29:55,252
I've had my bath.

337
00:29:58,631 --> 00:30:00,841
Are they all right?

338
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:04,929
They may fight, but they're always
on the same side when it matters.

339
00:30:05,054 --> 00:30:08,057
- Evening.
- Welcome home.

340
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:11,852
Suzu, which bean paste did you prefer?

341
00:30:13,604 --> 00:30:16,106
- The grainy one.
- Right.

342
00:30:16,232 --> 00:30:18,359
I like the strained one.

343
00:30:18,484 --> 00:30:20,611
- Where's Yoshino?
- In the bath.

344
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:25,032
How come she went first?

345
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:27,952
You take so long,
you should go last.

346
00:30:28,077 --> 00:30:29,787
Drama queen!

347
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:39,588
Big sis!

348
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:42,550
Big sis!

349
00:30:42,675 --> 00:30:47,429
Stop screaming,
you're not a child anymore.

350
00:30:49,098 --> 00:30:51,350
- It's just a hearth cricket.
- A what?

351
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:53,143
- You don't know it?
- I don't.

352
00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:54,937
It looks like this.

353
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:59,191
- Like this?
- Let's go and have a look.

354
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:01,235
Don't be scared!

355
00:31:46,572 --> 00:31:49,700
- Morning, Suzu.
- Good morning.

356
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:51,535
It's cold today.

357
00:32:05,341 --> 00:32:07,051
Amazing!

358
00:32:07,176 --> 00:32:09,094
Is this all plum wine?

359
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:15,643
Let's see, now... We made these
last year and these the year before.

360
00:32:15,768 --> 00:32:19,021
And Grandma made this batch
10 years ago.

361
00:32:26,487 --> 00:32:28,030
It's so pretty.

362
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:47,925
Chika, stop pouring soy sauce
over all your food.

363
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:51,011
Why didn't you wake me up?
Don't you care?

364
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:52,596
Sorry, Yoshino-san.

365
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:55,599
- The alarm didn't go off.
- I heard it.

366
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:57,101
Did I turn it off?

367
00:32:57,226 --> 00:32:59,228
It's your own fault.

368
00:32:59,353 --> 00:33:02,272
- Oh, no, it's already ten past.
- Calm down.

369
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:05,526
Shut up.
Anybody seen my moisturiser?

370
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:08,237
Not me.

371
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:12,574
- Sit down.
- Don't have time.

372
00:33:13,242 --> 00:33:16,120
Isn't that my blouse you're wearing?

373
00:33:16,245 --> 00:33:17,496
Oh, is it?

374
00:33:17,621 --> 00:33:19,456
Take it off!

375
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:23,251
- Let me borrow it, just for today.
- No, I haven't even worn it yet.

376
00:33:23,377 --> 00:33:28,257
- You wore my boots the other day.
- When was that? It doesn't suit you.

377
00:33:28,382 --> 00:33:30,467
- Suzu, eat up.
- Too old lady-like?

378
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:33,303
How dare you call it "old lady-like"?

379
00:33:33,429 --> 00:33:35,222
"How dare you?"

380
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:37,641
Wear something more flashy.

381
00:33:38,684 --> 00:33:41,103
- I'm off.
- I'm off.

382
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,022
Suzu...

383
00:33:43,856 --> 00:33:46,108
- Don't forget this.
- I forgot.

384
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:47,776
Off you go.

385
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:52,573
- What now?
- Forgot my wallet. Oh, found it.

386
00:33:53,157 --> 00:33:55,325
- See you later.
- Bye!

387
00:33:55,451 --> 00:33:57,870
- Yoshino, the rubbish!
- You do it, sis!

388
00:33:57,995 --> 00:33:59,955
Watch your steps!

389
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:04,293
- I'll never make it.
- You'll make it if you run.

390
00:34:27,107 --> 00:34:29,610
Yoshino-san, quick!
The train's coming.

391
00:34:37,534 --> 00:34:40,204
- Will you be on time, Yoshino-san?
- What?

392
00:34:40,329 --> 00:34:43,040
Who cares? My job doesn't matter.

393
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:47,544
Hey, Suzu, you can stop
calling me "Yoshino-san".

394
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:49,546
"San"?

395
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:52,549
Not "Yoshino-san",
just Yotchan.

396
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:55,636
OK.

397
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:58,514
How's school?
Got a boyfriend?

398
00:34:59,306 --> 00:35:01,100
Oh, well, no...

399
00:35:01,225 --> 00:35:05,062
Hurry up and get one.
It'll change your world.

400
00:35:05,187 --> 00:35:07,523
Really? How?

401
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:11,026
It makes even the shittiest job
seem all right.

402
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:27,501
Thank you very much.

403
00:35:29,253 --> 00:35:33,590
<i>Thank you for waiting.
Ticket holder 56...</i>

404
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:37,302
Thank you for waiting.
Customer with ticket 56, please.

405
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:47,604
I want to close out this account.

406
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:49,606
Yes, certainly.

407
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:55,279
Please use this form
to fill out your information.

408
00:35:58,365 --> 00:36:00,159
Get a move on.

409
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:06,498
<i>I've been paying that guy
the money you loaned me.</i>

410
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:10,919
<i>Please find another guy,
one better than me.</i>

411
00:36:25,434 --> 00:36:30,939
But Yamanoi kept climbing mountains
even after he lost ten fingers and toes.

412
00:36:31,064 --> 00:36:33,483
That's right, Hamada.
Let's climb again.

413
00:36:33,609 --> 00:36:36,653
But not everyone can be like him.

414
00:36:38,989 --> 00:36:40,407
Check these out.

415
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:42,492
They match yours.
Just a different colour.

416
00:36:42,618 --> 00:36:45,204
- No way.
- Matching shoes!

417
00:36:48,415 --> 00:36:51,251
- I'll come to the match.
- OK.

418
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:55,505
- You'll come to the match, right?
- Of course. Good luck.

419
00:36:55,631 --> 00:36:57,132
Thank you.

420
00:36:57,257 --> 00:36:58,592
Play well.

421
00:37:02,012 --> 00:37:04,097
Have you seen Arai?

422
00:37:04,223 --> 00:37:06,099
She was just here...

423
00:37:06,225 --> 00:37:09,269
Oh-oh, what's she done this time?

424
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:14,274
How could she record 120 litres of urine
volume for Mr Sato in Room 211!

425
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:16,068
That's crazy.

426
00:37:16,193 --> 00:37:18,445
It's no laughing matter.

427
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:26,745
Mrs Ninomiya?

428
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:30,249
Oh, Sachi! Long time, no see.

429
00:37:30,374 --> 00:37:33,418
Long time, indeed.
Are you feeling all right?

430
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:37,297
My stomach's been hurting me a little.

431
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:40,300
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

432
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:45,514
You know, my mother died
and so much else has happened.

433
00:37:46,682 --> 00:37:48,893
It's nearly a year ago.

434
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:53,272
Please come to the cafe again soon.

435
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:57,150
It brings back memories.

436
00:37:58,902 --> 00:38:00,696
I just remembered,

437
00:38:00,821 --> 00:38:03,824
your sister came in the other day.
Her name's Suzu?

438
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:07,494
Yes, she said your fried mackerel
was truly delicious.

439
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:10,539
She's so bright and lively.

440
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:13,500
She laughs a lot.

441
00:38:15,419 --> 00:38:16,920
Really?

442
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:19,548
She's really popular at the cafe.

443
00:38:21,425 --> 00:38:22,884
That's great.

444
00:38:36,565 --> 00:38:38,734
- Welcome home.
- Evening.

445
00:38:43,572 --> 00:38:45,532
It's so cold.

446
00:38:49,411 --> 00:38:51,955
Did you manage to study at all?

447
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:55,667
Yoshino-san started getting
really upset.

448
00:38:58,086 --> 00:39:00,464
She probably got dumped again.

449
00:39:00,589 --> 00:39:03,592
She never gives up
on bad romances.

450
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:09,639
You'll catch cold
if you don't change and go to bed.

451
00:39:09,765 --> 00:39:12,559
I'm fine. I'll just sleep here.

452
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:16,980
I'm fine, too. Goodnight.

453
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:19,900
Not you as well, Chika?
You're impossible.

454
00:39:20,025 --> 00:39:22,277
Goodnight, then.

455
00:39:23,153 --> 00:39:24,696
Night-night.

456
00:39:28,742 --> 00:39:30,118
Suzu...

457
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:37,501
You can always talk to me
about any problems, OK?

458
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:41,380
OK. Thank you so much.

459
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:56,853
- Here you are.
- Thanks.

460
00:39:57,813 --> 00:40:02,234
Someday, I want to walk under
these autumn leaves with a cool guy.

461
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:05,028
- Sorry.
- Me too, with a cute girl.

462
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:07,239
You're such a romantic.

463
00:40:17,791 --> 00:40:19,960
Not bad so far.

464
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:24,339
Asano, your marker's really slow,
so go after him one-on-one.

465
00:40:24,464 --> 00:40:27,884
Ozaki, as soon as it opens up,
invade their space.

466
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:30,720
The team's changed since Suzu joined.

467
00:40:30,846 --> 00:40:34,015
Right! Futa's moving better, too.

468
00:40:34,975 --> 00:40:37,853
Do you think those two are,
you know...?

469
00:40:37,978 --> 00:40:40,981
- What's "you know"?
- You know...

470
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:44,192
Oh, that "you know"?

471
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:52,409
Move back!

472
00:40:57,289 --> 00:40:59,082
Stay on her.

473
00:41:02,878 --> 00:41:04,588
Hey, Asano!

474
00:41:05,088 --> 00:41:06,715
It's wide open.

475
00:41:13,305 --> 00:41:14,848
OK, Asano!

476
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:28,195
A Terminal Care ward?

477
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,031
We've had so many requests.

478
00:41:31,156 --> 00:41:35,660
Next autumn, we'll convert
the fifth floor into that ward.

479
00:41:37,954 --> 00:41:41,166
When they moved forward
with this plan,

480
00:41:41,291 --> 00:41:43,835
you were the first person I thought of.

481
00:41:45,462 --> 00:41:47,047
What do you think?

482
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:50,175
Please think it over.

483
00:41:52,928 --> 00:41:54,179
I will.

484
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,059
Welcome.

485
00:42:05,565 --> 00:42:09,319
The potatoes are good,
from Hokkaido.

486
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:12,531
I'm making potato salad.

487
00:42:33,552 --> 00:42:36,096
Terminal care is important.

488
00:42:37,472 --> 00:42:42,477
But it's really tough taking care
of patients facing certain death.

489
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:46,106
I'm in Paediatrics,

490
00:42:46,231 --> 00:42:49,985
so I want to save
as many lives as possible.

491
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:56,157
You should really think
the decision over.

492
00:42:57,951 --> 00:42:59,327
I will.

493
00:43:10,797 --> 00:43:13,049
So, about tomorrow...

494
00:43:14,217 --> 00:43:16,803
The Night Aquarium,
at Enoshima.

495
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:23,393
The thing is, my mother-in-law
told me that she's unstable again.

496
00:43:24,644 --> 00:43:26,646
Hospitalised again?

497
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:31,234
She's not back in the hospital,
but I need to check in on her.

498
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:32,736
Sorry.

499
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:38,867
You should do that for her.

500
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:21,701
I'm home.

501
00:44:22,702 --> 00:44:24,704
Suzu, are you all right?

502
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:27,499
Suzu? Oh, no...

503
00:44:31,753 --> 00:44:34,255
- What happened?
- Oh, hi, sis.

504
00:44:34,923 --> 00:44:38,218
We celebrated her scoring a goal
with some plum wine.

505
00:44:38,343 --> 00:44:40,929
But it was the batch I spiked
with hard liquor.

506
00:44:41,054 --> 00:44:42,639
It looked the lightest...

507
00:44:42,764 --> 00:44:45,809
- How much?
- Just this one glass.

508
00:44:49,229 --> 00:44:51,898
I hate Yoko-san!

509
00:44:52,941 --> 00:44:55,276
Dad's an idiot!

510
00:45:02,158 --> 00:45:03,660
I feel hot.

511
00:45:04,661 --> 00:45:06,830
I feel sick.

512
00:45:06,955 --> 00:45:09,082
Hold it in.

513
00:45:09,791 --> 00:45:13,753
Hold on, you'll be fine.
Over here, here.

514
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:16,297
In here!

515
00:45:22,387 --> 00:45:25,014
She's been keeping
all her troubles to herself.

516
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:26,808
She lived through a lot.

517
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:29,185
She's just like you when you're drunk.

518
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:31,855
I don't get that bad.

519
00:45:48,621 --> 00:45:50,582
Look, she smiled.

520
00:45:53,793 --> 00:45:56,838
Look, she has a beauty spot here.

521
00:45:56,963 --> 00:45:58,631
You're right.

522
00:45:59,799 --> 00:46:01,885
She has such long eyelashes.

523
00:46:03,636 --> 00:46:06,389
Her ears look just like yours, sis.

524
00:46:06,514 --> 00:46:07,974
Really?

525
00:46:18,318 --> 00:46:20,195
I'm sorry, Suzu.

526
00:46:21,654 --> 00:46:24,532
It's your fault, Chika,
but it's your fault, too, Suzu.

527
00:46:26,326 --> 00:46:30,997
I wanted to taste
our homemade plum wine.

528
00:46:33,208 --> 00:46:34,793
OK, then.

529
00:46:34,918 --> 00:46:39,380
When the plums ripen next year,
I'll make you a batch without alcohol.

530
00:46:40,215 --> 00:46:42,842
The plums are from our garden?

531
00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:44,844
Yes, that's right.

532
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:49,182
You can see our plum tree from here.
Didn't you notice it?

533
00:46:58,775 --> 00:47:01,986
Look, there.
It grows a lot of plums.

534
00:47:03,988 --> 00:47:06,574
And caterpillars,
along with the plums.

535
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:09,953
Amazing.
I can't wait to pick them.

536
00:47:10,078 --> 00:47:11,746
Eh? The caterpillars?

537
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:14,415
No, the ripe plums.

538
00:47:16,584 --> 00:47:21,297
We have to pick bugs and disinfect.
Every living thing takes effort.

539
00:47:21,422 --> 00:47:23,967
Grandma always said that.

540
00:47:24,092 --> 00:47:26,386
We have six more months to wait.

541
00:47:26,511 --> 00:47:28,513
I look forward to it.

542
00:47:28,638 --> 00:47:31,474
You puncture them like this...

543
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:34,102
That's right.
To bring out the flavour.

544
00:47:47,615 --> 00:47:49,450
Here it is.

545
00:48:00,295 --> 00:48:01,963
It's so heavy!

546
00:48:02,088 --> 00:48:04,090
Yes, they're really heavy.

547
00:48:04,215 --> 00:48:05,758
You look desperate!

548
00:48:34,495 --> 00:48:36,539
They're cooked.

549
00:48:36,664 --> 00:48:38,583
Turn them over.

550
00:48:52,555 --> 00:48:55,683
- Thanks for your help!
- Thank you!

551
00:48:55,808 --> 00:48:57,226
That was great.

552
00:48:57,352 --> 00:48:59,771
- Thanks.
- See you.

553
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:03,608
- Thanks for the whitebait.
- Don't tear the bag.

554
00:49:17,372 --> 00:49:18,706
How do I look?

555
00:49:18,831 --> 00:49:21,417
- Great.
- Like a businesswoman.

556
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:27,757
So tell me, what does "Customer Care
Specialist, Financing Section" mean?

557
00:49:27,882 --> 00:49:30,635
It means that from now on,

558
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:33,805
I can go out and meet clients
with the section chief.

559
00:49:36,391 --> 00:49:39,269
- Live for your job?
- Is that bad?

560
00:49:39,394 --> 00:49:42,522
I'm not saying it is,
if you're serious.

561
00:49:42,647 --> 00:49:44,774
I'm dead serious.

562
00:49:44,899 --> 00:49:48,444
I hope you're not taking the job
because you got ditched by some guy.

563
00:49:48,569 --> 00:49:52,448
I can't compete with someone
who's dedicated decades to her job.

564
00:49:52,573 --> 00:49:56,327
Watch what you're saying.
Listen, you...

565
00:49:56,452 --> 00:49:58,913
Thank you for the food!

566
00:49:59,038 --> 00:50:00,456
Help yourselves.

567
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:08,965
- How is it?
- Delicious.

568
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:12,343
Right? Fresh whitebait
is a rare treat.

569
00:50:12,468 --> 00:50:14,762
- Your first time?
- Yes.

570
00:50:16,097 --> 00:50:17,432
Thought so.

571
00:50:18,808 --> 00:50:21,936
Yoshino, sit properly at the table.

572
00:50:24,063 --> 00:50:26,816
Suzu, don't shovel your food.

573
00:50:26,941 --> 00:50:29,360
She's copying you, Chika.

574
00:50:29,485 --> 00:50:33,239
A little higher, a little lower.

575
00:50:33,364 --> 00:50:36,576
OK, it's prettier with the dandelion.

576
00:50:37,452 --> 00:50:39,704
- Dandelion.
- Pretty.

577
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:42,957
Paste it however you want.

578
00:50:43,082 --> 00:50:44,292
Cute, great.

579
00:50:46,836 --> 00:50:48,629
I'll paste this.

580
00:50:50,673 --> 00:50:53,676
Measure it first, Chika.

581
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:55,136
Oh, right.

582
00:51:01,976 --> 00:51:03,269
Cut it out!

583
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:05,146
Hey, stop it!

584
00:51:10,818 --> 00:51:12,403
Any shells?

585
00:51:15,198 --> 00:51:18,076
Look at Suzu's footprints.

586
00:51:23,831 --> 00:51:26,918
- They're so tiny.
- Cute.

587
00:51:33,925 --> 00:51:36,469
- Good evening.
- Welcome!

588
00:51:38,763 --> 00:51:42,225
This is the first time
you've all come in together.

589
00:51:42,350 --> 00:51:44,560
We had a craving for your food.

590
00:51:44,685 --> 00:51:46,395
Thank you for remembering.

591
00:51:46,521 --> 00:51:47,647
Let's see...

592
00:51:47,772 --> 00:51:50,775
I'll have a beer.
And the marinated mackerel.

593
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:53,861
I'm so sorry, we've run out.

594
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:58,032
I'll have the fried mackerel set.
And a beer.

595
00:51:58,157 --> 00:51:59,784
How unusual.

596
00:51:59,909 --> 00:52:01,661
I'll have the same.

597
00:52:01,786 --> 00:52:03,162
Me, too.

598
00:52:03,287 --> 00:52:06,374
- No beer for you, Suzu.
- I know that.

599
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:11,671
Check this out.

600
00:52:13,673 --> 00:52:15,341
You've been promoted!

601
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:17,385
Not really.

602
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:20,471
- So you've been to the beach?
- Yes.

603
00:52:20,972 --> 00:52:22,473
She's still a child.

604
00:52:22,598 --> 00:52:26,185
But you used to line up
all your shells here.

605
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:27,353
Did I?

606
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:31,190
And you got scolded
for getting sand all over the table.

607
00:52:31,315 --> 00:52:33,901
And Chika peed in her pants there.

608
00:52:34,026 --> 00:52:36,237
That's right, what a mess.

609
00:52:36,362 --> 00:52:40,074
- I ran home for your clean clothes.
- Stop teasing me.

610
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:43,202
- What do you want, Chika?
- I don't know...

611
00:52:43,327 --> 00:52:45,371
Shall I decide for you?

612
00:52:45,496 --> 00:52:47,748
- Let's see...
- No, don't.

613
00:52:48,833 --> 00:52:51,127
- What shall I get?
- Cheers.

614
00:52:55,506 --> 00:52:56,716
Asano!

615
00:52:56,841 --> 00:52:58,134
Morning.

616
00:52:59,844 --> 00:53:02,305
- Which teacher do you want?
- Which teacher?

617
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:04,390
- Not Osawa.
- Definitely not.

618
00:53:04,515 --> 00:53:05,975
Good morning!

619
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:07,935
I heard the news!

620
00:53:09,228 --> 00:53:10,771
What news?

621
00:53:11,939 --> 00:53:13,441
What?

622
00:53:13,566 --> 00:53:14,942
I don't know.

623
00:53:19,071 --> 00:53:21,574
- Morning!
- You're in our class.

624
00:53:22,074 --> 00:53:23,659
Me, too!

625
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:25,828
That's good news!

626
00:53:25,953 --> 00:53:28,831
Lucky you're in Asano's class.

627
00:53:28,956 --> 00:53:30,875
Why's that?

628
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,711
- Aren't you dating?
- What are you saying?

629
00:53:33,836 --> 00:53:35,755
I already told everyone.

630
00:53:37,173 --> 00:53:40,635
What are you talking about?
What a mess...

631
00:53:41,427 --> 00:53:44,805
- Are you really dating him?
- I'm not dating him!

632
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:48,684
My favourite dishes are stir-fried beef
and roasted beef tongue.

633
00:53:48,809 --> 00:53:52,855
I want to win
at the summer contest.

634
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:54,523
Thank you.

635
00:53:54,649 --> 00:53:57,318
Next, Seto.

636
00:53:59,487 --> 00:54:02,698
I'm Seto Tomoki.
Please call me Tomoki.

637
00:54:02,823 --> 00:54:06,285
I'm on the baseball team.
My hobby is skateboarding.

638
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:10,790
I'm aiming for the national
championships, so cheer for me.

639
00:54:10,915 --> 00:54:12,833
Thank you.

640
00:54:13,334 --> 00:54:18,297
Chief, I bought this, for client visits.
These, too.

641
00:54:19,799 --> 00:54:22,134
I thought I should dress for business.

642
00:54:28,683 --> 00:54:30,017
Hello.

643
00:54:34,021 --> 00:54:39,610
I've seen many people give up,
having to go bankrupt, losing everything.

644
00:54:40,111 --> 00:54:43,364
But your factory still has potential.

645
00:54:44,031 --> 00:54:48,327
- Really?
- Your future isn't pitch black.

646
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:53,749
Then again,
it's not exactly bright, either.

647
00:54:58,462 --> 00:55:02,758
I feel a little bit better.

648
00:55:02,883 --> 00:55:06,178
- Right?
- Yes, a little.

649
00:55:07,346 --> 00:55:12,643
I recommend you go ahead
and terminate your debits

650
00:55:12,768 --> 00:55:15,479
with the Sagami Bank, and...

651
00:55:23,904 --> 00:55:26,157
So, you had a younger brother?

652
00:55:28,576 --> 00:55:33,247
Mother cut him off from the family
and he left years ago.

653
00:55:34,457 --> 00:55:37,293
But he suddenly called me,

654
00:55:37,418 --> 00:55:40,004
demanding our mother's inheritance.

655
00:55:42,590 --> 00:55:45,968
He's probably deep in debt somewhere.

656
00:55:46,093 --> 00:55:52,016
But I told him,
"All I have is this cafe."

657
00:55:52,141 --> 00:55:54,894
And he said,
"Sell the cafe, then."

658
00:55:57,938 --> 00:56:02,026
I'm really hoping she can find a way
to hold onto this place.

659
00:56:02,151 --> 00:56:08,282
For her,
it's her one and only treasure.

660
00:56:08,991 --> 00:56:11,410
It's nothing special.

661
00:56:12,453 --> 00:56:15,664
But it is my mother's legacy.

662
00:56:15,790 --> 00:56:17,249
I see.

663
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:22,213
I'm sorry to trouble you with all this.

664
00:56:22,338 --> 00:56:26,425
It's our job to deal
with people's troubles.

665
00:56:42,274 --> 00:56:45,653
I think you're still hiding something.

666
00:56:47,571 --> 00:56:50,950
They say beautiful women
keep all the secrets.

667
00:56:54,245 --> 00:56:58,040
My eyesight's getting worse.

668
00:56:59,291 --> 00:57:03,838
Shall we admire the cherry blossoms
before your eyes get worse?

669
00:57:05,673 --> 00:57:07,633
Sounds good.

670
00:57:07,758 --> 00:57:09,176
When?

671
00:57:17,226 --> 00:57:21,188
You worked at Metropolitan Bank
before you came to our bank, right?

672
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,277
Why did you leave?

673
00:57:29,196 --> 00:57:35,995
I suddenly realised
it just wasn't where I belonged.

674
00:57:38,581 --> 00:57:40,541
Has that happened to you?

675
00:58:07,693 --> 00:58:09,570
What are you staring at?

676
00:58:11,489 --> 00:58:13,657
Got a date, Yotchan?

677
00:58:14,742 --> 00:58:19,955
I wish. But I'm not in the mood
for that right now.

678
00:58:23,459 --> 00:58:28,088
So I'm not doing this for a man,
I'm doing it for me.

679
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:33,969
A good pedicure lifts your spirits.
Shall I do you?

680
00:58:34,929 --> 00:58:38,224
No, thanks.
I'll ruin it playing soccer.

681
00:58:38,349 --> 00:58:40,518
Just your little toes.

682
00:58:49,276 --> 00:58:50,861
That tickles!

683
00:58:50,986 --> 00:58:52,738
Don't move.

684
00:58:56,534 --> 00:58:58,118
First time?

685
00:59:01,163 --> 00:59:03,999
When was your first pedicure?

686
00:59:04,124 --> 00:59:07,002
Me? I was 6 years old.

687
00:59:07,127 --> 00:59:08,462
So young-

688
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:13,217
When Mum took me to Yokohama,

689
00:59:13,342 --> 00:59:17,513
she bought me
a bright red nail polish.

690
00:59:17,638 --> 00:59:21,600
When I wore it to school,
they found out when I was in the pool.

691
00:59:21,725 --> 00:59:24,186
The teacher got so mad at me.

692
00:59:26,522 --> 00:59:28,357
Cool!

693
00:59:28,482 --> 00:59:32,027
We were worried that
we wouldn't get much whitebait.

694
00:59:32,987 --> 00:59:35,531
But it's the best season now.
Eat up.

695
00:59:35,656 --> 00:59:37,825
Thanks!

696
00:59:43,163 --> 00:59:44,790
Tasty!

697
00:59:44,915 --> 00:59:46,125
Isn't it?

698
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:49,545
Whitebait on toast
is a tasty combo.

699
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:52,339
This is your original recipe, right?

700
00:59:52,464 --> 00:59:54,466
Yeah, that's right.

701
00:59:56,010 --> 00:59:58,846
Is your cafe old?

702
01:00:02,975 --> 01:00:06,353
It's been 20 years since I took over.

703
01:00:07,354 --> 01:00:10,858
Did they have whitebait toast
back then?

704
01:00:11,734 --> 01:00:15,070
Originally, I used to eat it
for my lunch,

705
01:00:15,195 --> 01:00:18,824
but a customer saw me
and ordered it.

706
01:00:18,949 --> 01:00:20,826
That's how I started serving it.

707
01:00:30,586 --> 01:00:34,590
I think my dad used to go that cafe.

708
01:00:37,551 --> 01:00:41,305
When I lived with my dad,
he used to make it for me.

709
01:00:43,807 --> 01:00:47,227
Then, do you want
to go back tomorrow?

710
01:00:49,021 --> 01:00:52,066
If it bothers you,
maybe you should ask him.

711
01:00:55,486 --> 01:00:57,112
No, it's OK.

712
01:00:59,490 --> 01:01:02,242
Then, why don't you ask
your older sisters?

713
01:01:03,619 --> 01:01:08,707
It's hard for me to talk about my dad
with my older sisters.

714
01:01:27,017 --> 01:01:29,395
Cherry blossom season's over.

715
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:32,356
Up north in Yamagata,
they're just blooming.

716
01:01:36,652 --> 01:01:40,239
When they found out
my dad was sick,

717
01:01:40,364 --> 01:01:43,826
they told him he might not make it
till cherry blossom time.

718
01:01:46,954 --> 01:01:51,542
But he fought to stay alive and
we enjoyed the blossoms in the hospital.

719
01:01:51,667 --> 01:01:52,960
Right...

720
01:02:08,142 --> 01:02:09,893
Asano...

721
01:02:11,603 --> 01:02:14,356
- Do you have time?
- Sure...

722
01:02:27,411 --> 01:02:29,288
Where are we going?

723
01:02:30,122 --> 01:02:32,166
- A tunnel.
- A tunnel?

724
01:02:35,002 --> 01:02:38,005
- Shall I get off?
- It's all right.

725
01:02:48,891 --> 01:02:51,769
- It's the tunnel!
- Right?

726
01:02:54,521 --> 01:02:56,565
The blossoms are huge!

727
01:02:59,401 --> 01:03:01,153
Amazing!

728
01:03:58,669 --> 01:04:02,047
It's easier this year
having Suzu here.

729
01:04:03,006 --> 01:04:04,967
You never help anyway.

730
01:04:05,092 --> 01:04:08,470
You're right.
I'm so glad we got a little sister.

731
01:04:11,598 --> 01:04:14,309
Right up there,
there's a big one.

732
01:04:14,434 --> 01:04:16,687
- This one?
- Watch your footing.

733
01:04:16,812 --> 01:04:18,814
In front of you.

734
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:22,734
Careful.

735
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:25,362
Look at it. It's so big.

736
01:04:25,487 --> 01:04:28,407
"CHI"

737
01:04:28,532 --> 01:04:32,452
This lot is for Great Auntie,
and this lot for our neighbours.

738
01:04:33,495 --> 01:04:37,457
- A so-so harvest.
- With all these?

739
01:04:38,542 --> 01:04:41,169
When Grandma was alive,
there were a lot more.

740
01:04:41,295 --> 01:04:44,298
There were so many,
we gave them to all the neighbours.

741
01:04:46,216 --> 01:04:48,719
This plum tree's getting old.

742
01:04:49,636 --> 01:04:53,891
I think Grandpa planted it
the year mum was born.

743
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:56,894
It's 55.

744
01:04:57,019 --> 01:04:59,146
55 years old?

745
01:05:03,066 --> 01:05:05,360
Yoshino, you answer it.

746
01:05:05,485 --> 01:05:06,737
Chika...

747
01:05:13,243 --> 01:05:14,745
Hello, Koda speaking.

748
01:05:15,996 --> 01:05:18,665
Oh, hello, Great Auntie.

749
01:05:19,291 --> 01:05:20,876
Yes, we're fine.

750
01:05:22,336 --> 01:05:24,212
Hang on a moment.

751
01:05:24,338 --> 01:05:25,589
Sachi...

752
01:05:29,176 --> 01:05:30,594
It's Great Auntie.

753
01:05:32,554 --> 01:05:33,931
Hello?

754
01:05:39,561 --> 01:05:41,355
Mother's coming?

755
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:42,898
Why?

756
01:05:52,908 --> 01:05:56,411
Well, it is her mother's
memorial service.

757
01:05:56,536 --> 01:05:59,373
<i>I have a bad feeling about this.</i>

758
01:05:59,498 --> 01:06:00,958
Don't overthink it.

759
01:06:02,417 --> 01:06:05,795
But she didn't come
for the first or the third memorials.

760
01:06:05,921 --> 01:06:08,674
She said it was too far
and cost too much.

761
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:10,509
<i>Where is she now?</i>

762
01:06:11,593 --> 01:06:14,429
- Sapporo.
-<i> How long's it been?</i>

763
01:06:16,223 --> 01:06:18,058
14 years or so.

764
01:06:19,184 --> 01:06:22,104
She left us
when I was in high school.

765
01:06:22,229 --> 01:06:24,523
<i>Maybe she needed time.</i>

766
01:06:25,357 --> 01:06:26,608
Time?

767
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:30,779
<i>Mothers and daughters, eh?</i>

768
01:06:32,030 --> 01:06:34,116
Mothers and daughters...

769
01:06:34,241 --> 01:06:39,037
<i>Mother-daughter ties are harder
to break than marital ties.</i>

770
01:06:41,373 --> 01:06:44,042
Marital ties aren't easy to break either.

771
01:06:48,755 --> 01:06:50,215
Sorry...

772
01:07:06,064 --> 01:07:09,443
What shall we do for supper?
I haven't prepare anything.

773
01:07:09,568 --> 01:07:11,361
Shall we order in?

774
01:07:11,486 --> 01:07:14,948
Great Auntie called again.
Mum's going to stay over there.

775
01:07:16,074 --> 01:07:19,619
She should stay here,
it's her house.

776
01:07:20,412 --> 01:07:23,165
Maybe she feels too guilty.

777
01:07:23,290 --> 01:07:25,417
It happened years ago.

778
01:07:26,376 --> 01:07:28,920
I remember it like it was yesterday.

779
01:07:33,675 --> 01:07:37,095
Should I attend tomorrow?

780
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:43,852
Maybe I shouldn't...

781
01:07:43,977 --> 01:07:46,730
No, it's not your fault, Suzu.

782
01:07:46,855 --> 01:07:49,608
She's just afraid to see us.

783
01:07:49,733 --> 01:07:51,943
Don't worry about it.

784
01:07:52,652 --> 01:07:54,446
Go and take a bath.

785
01:07:57,866 --> 01:07:58,992
Go ahead.

786
01:08:00,702 --> 01:08:02,829
I will, then.

787
01:08:06,416 --> 01:08:11,296
- Just don't make a scene, OK?
- What scene?

788
01:08:11,421 --> 01:08:16,134
Remember when you got hysterical
at Grandma's funeral?

789
01:08:16,259 --> 01:08:17,969
I didn't get hysterical.

790
01:08:18,095 --> 01:08:21,932
- You're childish that way.
- Look who's talking!

791
01:08:23,767 --> 01:08:27,020
I wonder what Mum'll think of Suzu.

792
01:08:27,145 --> 01:08:29,773
I don't care what she thinks.

793
01:08:29,898 --> 01:08:32,442
I knew you'd say that.

794
01:08:51,461 --> 01:08:55,590
KODA FAMILY
SEVENTH MEMORIAL

795
01:08:59,219 --> 01:09:01,346
Thank you for coming.

796
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:07,394
She's late.

797
01:09:07,519 --> 01:09:10,355
Great Auntie's with her
so she should be fine.

798
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:15,110
She's up to her old tricks of forgetting
and losing things at the last minute.

799
01:09:15,235 --> 01:09:19,781
Hurry up, Miyako! You're always late.

800
01:09:19,906 --> 01:09:21,616
Just wait, Auntie.

801
01:09:21,741 --> 01:09:24,077
It looks bad,
the chief mourner arriving late.

802
01:09:24,202 --> 01:09:26,163
- Mum.
- Mum.

803
01:09:32,169 --> 01:09:36,381
- It's been so long.
- Sorry I'm late.

804
01:09:36,506 --> 01:09:38,800
I couldn't remember
where I'd put my necklace.

805
01:09:38,925 --> 01:09:41,052
I thought so.

806
01:09:41,178 --> 01:09:44,014
Chika, you changed your hairstyle.

807
01:09:44,139 --> 01:09:48,059
I like your hair colour, Yoshino.
Maybe I'll try it, too.

808
01:09:48,185 --> 01:09:50,812
Thanks for attending today.

809
01:09:50,937 --> 01:09:54,107
Sorry I've been out of touch
for so long.

810
01:09:54,232 --> 01:09:56,067
Mother, this is Suzu.

811
01:09:57,194 --> 01:09:59,863
Pleased to meet you.
I'm Asano Suzu.

812
01:09:59,988 --> 01:10:04,868
Oh, so you're...
Oh, I see.

813
01:10:05,744 --> 01:10:07,996
Hello. I'm these girls' mother.

814
01:10:08,121 --> 01:10:11,333
Remember me?
We met once last year.

815
01:10:11,458 --> 01:10:13,919
Yes, you're my sisters' Great Aunt.

816
01:10:14,044 --> 01:10:15,962
Have you got used to living here?

817
01:10:16,087 --> 01:10:19,466
Are you eating all right?
You're really get along with this lot?

818
01:10:19,591 --> 01:10:22,928
- You don't have to bring that up now.
- But it's important.

819
01:10:23,053 --> 01:10:25,639
Didn't you get along
with your stepmother?

820
01:10:25,764 --> 01:10:28,183
- Great Auntie!
- My stepmother was kind to me.

821
01:10:28,308 --> 01:10:30,143
And you're not lonely?

822
01:10:30,268 --> 01:10:32,937
No, it's like I'm the youngest
in the girls' dormitory.

823
01:10:33,063 --> 01:10:35,816
My, you're so witty!

824
01:11:04,803 --> 01:11:08,890
Sorry about today.
I put you in a spot.

825
01:11:09,015 --> 01:11:10,141
No...

826
01:11:11,142 --> 01:11:13,353
I put myself in a spot.

827
01:11:16,606 --> 01:11:19,192
Are you getting along
with those three?

828
01:11:19,317 --> 01:11:20,902
Yes.

829
01:11:21,027 --> 01:11:23,905
Sachi's a tough one.

830
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:26,950
She grew up instead of me.

831
01:11:27,075 --> 01:11:30,036
She's very kind to me.

832
01:11:30,161 --> 01:11:32,247
I hope you get along.

833
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:58,565
Oh, it's finally all over.
Well done, all.

834
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:06,281
Don't let it melt.

835
01:12:06,406 --> 01:12:07,949
Where's that child?

836
01:12:08,074 --> 01:12:12,162
Ah, Suzu-chan, have a seat.
Eat it before it melts.

837
01:12:13,079 --> 01:12:14,831
- Thank you.
- Please.

838
01:12:14,956 --> 01:12:16,833
Memorial services are exhausting.

839
01:12:16,958 --> 01:12:19,586
You managed to drink enough.

840
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:21,671
I was just getting started.

841
01:12:21,796 --> 01:12:23,173
Yoshino!

842
01:12:24,591 --> 01:12:26,634
So many people came.

843
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:28,845
That's because she was a teacher.

844
01:12:28,970 --> 01:12:33,224
She taught so many students
and she really looked after them.

845
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:36,019
It used to be so lively here.

846
01:12:36,144 --> 01:12:39,147
Auntie, you're here,
so it's good timing.

847
01:12:39,272 --> 01:12:44,235
I'm thinking we should just
get rid of this house.

848
01:12:44,361 --> 01:12:47,614
Get rid of it? You mean, sell it?

849
01:12:47,739 --> 01:12:50,658
The garden needs so much work.

850
01:12:50,784 --> 01:12:54,830
The girls will all get married,
and an apartment's easier to manage.

851
01:12:54,954 --> 01:12:57,331
Don't be so selfish?

852
01:12:57,457 --> 01:13:00,794
You have no right to do anything
about this house.

853
01:13:02,003 --> 01:13:05,882
You never once helped out
with the gardening.

854
01:13:06,007 --> 01:13:10,345
What do you know about managing?
You dumped us and this house.

855
01:13:10,470 --> 01:13:12,889
What are you so angry about?

856
01:13:13,014 --> 01:13:15,225
I just thought it'd be a good idea.

857
01:13:15,350 --> 01:13:17,310
That's enough of that.

858
01:13:18,353 --> 01:13:23,817
Why do you always say it like that?
Of course I feel bad about it.

859
01:13:23,942 --> 01:13:28,363
But it all started because your father
got involved with another woman.

860
01:13:28,488 --> 01:13:30,740
Stop it, both of you.

861
01:13:30,865 --> 01:13:33,409
With you,
it's always someone else's fault.

862
01:13:33,535 --> 01:13:38,290
You couldn't divorce because of us.
Grandma said no, so you didn't take us.

863
01:13:38,415 --> 01:13:42,252
But what could I do? It's all true.

864
01:13:42,377 --> 01:13:44,921
Act your age and
stop whining like a child!

865
01:13:45,046 --> 01:13:47,090
That's enough, both of you.

866
01:13:47,215 --> 01:13:49,843
Sachi, be careful what you say.

867
01:13:49,968 --> 01:13:51,970
She's your mother, after all.

868
01:13:52,095 --> 01:13:56,182
And Miyako, you share the blame
for him taking up with another woman.

869
01:13:56,307 --> 01:14:00,061
- But...
- No buts! This conversation's over!

870
01:14:00,186 --> 01:14:02,397
Thank goodness my sister's dead.

871
01:14:03,231 --> 01:14:05,358
It's pitiable.

872
01:14:16,202 --> 01:14:18,955
It turned out exactly
how you worried it would.

873
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:21,875
Those two have never got along.

874
01:14:23,209 --> 01:14:26,754
Mum brought it up so suddenly.

875
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:30,758
But, you know, moving to an apartment
could be good.

876
01:14:30,884 --> 01:14:33,470
I dream about living alone.

877
01:14:33,595 --> 01:14:37,849
If you want to move out, go ahead.
I won't stop you.

878
01:14:39,267 --> 01:14:42,395
It's not like we're all going
to live here together forever.

879
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:44,522
Is that happiness?

880
01:14:44,647 --> 01:14:47,692
Now you sound like her.

881
01:14:47,817 --> 01:14:50,236
Do you hate it here?

882
01:14:50,361 --> 01:14:53,031
That's not what I said.

883
01:14:53,156 --> 01:14:56,242
But one clay,
Chika and Suzu will leave.

884
01:14:56,367 --> 01:14:57,952
Even you.

885
01:14:58,661 --> 01:15:02,248
It's my...responsibility...

886
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:05,793
...to look after this place.

887
01:15:05,919 --> 01:15:08,004
Nobody asked you to.

888
01:15:08,129 --> 01:15:09,506
Let's stop.

889
01:15:09,631 --> 01:15:11,633
What are you so pissed off about?

890
01:15:11,758 --> 01:15:15,595
You just want to show Mum that
you're in charge. It's just your spite.

891
01:15:17,138 --> 01:15:19,224
What do you mean, spite?

892
01:15:19,349 --> 01:15:21,476
When have I been spiteful?

893
01:15:21,601 --> 01:15:25,772
Like taking in Suzu,
just to spite Mum.

894
01:15:25,897 --> 01:15:29,192
You may not mind,

895
01:15:29,317 --> 01:15:33,530
but I feel bad for her
having to witness that today.

896
01:15:36,282 --> 01:15:40,328
I'm hungry.
Let's have something to eat.

897
01:15:49,295 --> 01:15:50,547
Knock-knock!

898
01:15:51,631 --> 01:15:52,924
Yes?

899
01:15:58,096 --> 01:16:01,558
I'm going to cook supper.
Will you help me?

900
01:16:08,898 --> 01:16:11,234
Oh, they serve sukiyaki.

901
01:16:12,443 --> 01:16:14,153
And shabu-shabu.

902
01:16:15,738 --> 01:16:17,824
Oh, I can't look.

903
01:16:19,993 --> 01:16:22,203
They've no scallops.

904
01:16:22,328 --> 01:16:24,330
How about clams?

905
01:16:24,455 --> 01:16:26,124
Too expensive.

906
01:16:28,167 --> 01:16:30,420
I just hope Suzu doesn't regret it.

907
01:16:30,545 --> 01:16:32,005
What?

908
01:16:33,172 --> 01:16:35,925
That she came to live with us.

909
01:16:36,050 --> 01:16:38,052
I'm sure she doesn't.

910
01:16:38,177 --> 01:16:40,888
But she takes things so seriously,
just like Sachi.

911
01:16:41,014 --> 01:16:45,351
- Even though she's the youngest.
- Too bad she's not more like you.

912
01:16:46,394 --> 01:16:48,980
What do you mean by that?

913
01:16:52,567 --> 01:16:54,694
That's enough onions.

914
01:17:00,867 --> 01:17:06,080
This is the first and last meal
my mum taught me how to cook.

915
01:17:09,042 --> 01:17:11,502
The reason it's seafood curry is,

916
01:17:11,628 --> 01:17:14,922
because you don't have to cook it
as long as meat.

917
01:17:15,048 --> 01:17:18,176
Just like her,
she never did like to cook.

918
01:17:26,601 --> 01:17:28,061
I'm sorry...

919
01:17:29,562 --> 01:17:31,439
...about my mother.

920
01:17:33,066 --> 01:17:36,861
Don't apologise.
It's nothing to do with you.

921
01:17:36,986 --> 01:17:39,906
Falling in love
with a married man...

922
01:17:42,241 --> 01:17:44,535
My mother was a bad person.

923
01:17:56,631 --> 01:17:58,216
I'm sorry.

924
01:17:59,801 --> 01:18:02,929
We've ended up hurting you.

925
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,102
But you see...

926
01:18:10,561 --> 01:18:13,439
...nobody could do anything about that.

927
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:16,693
It's not anyone's fault.

928
01:18:20,863 --> 01:18:24,158
We're home!
No scallops, so we got baby clams.

929
01:18:24,283 --> 01:18:28,246
And we got your custard cake
with extra chocolate.

930
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:22,633
What are you doing home?
Are you feeling sick?

931
01:19:22,759 --> 01:19:27,221
No, I'm fine.
I'm on the night shift tonight.

932
01:19:27,346 --> 01:19:29,098
What are you doing here?

933
01:19:31,017 --> 01:19:35,688
Things got out of hand yesterday
and I never gave you these.

934
01:19:35,813 --> 01:19:37,690
This is for you.

935
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:42,236
This is for Yoshino.
And Chika.

936
01:19:44,322 --> 01:19:47,450
And these are for Suzu-chan.

937
01:19:51,829 --> 01:19:55,124
- Are you not coming in?
- I have a plane to catch.

938
01:19:55,249 --> 01:19:59,337
And I want to visit my mother's grave.

939
01:19:59,462 --> 01:20:00,713
I see.

940
01:20:01,631 --> 01:20:05,218
See you. Take care of yourself.

941
01:20:14,811 --> 01:20:17,688
Wait! I'll come with you
to the grave.

942
01:20:23,736 --> 01:20:25,863
Auntie scolded me.

943
01:20:27,198 --> 01:20:31,452
She told me the house
belongs to you all now.

944
01:20:33,788 --> 01:20:35,498
I didn't realise.

945
01:20:36,374 --> 01:20:39,627
I felt suffocated, living there.

946
01:20:40,586 --> 01:20:44,465
I never thought that house would
become so precious to you.

947
01:20:45,967 --> 01:20:50,054
Why did you suddenly mention
selling the house?

948
01:20:50,179 --> 01:20:54,976
Oh, forget it.
Just pretend you never heard me.

949
01:21:08,197 --> 01:21:10,741
I know it's been a long time.

950
01:21:12,910 --> 01:21:14,328
Forgive me.

951
01:21:15,997 --> 01:21:18,332
For being a bad daughter.

952
01:21:26,549 --> 01:21:28,634
Looks like it's stopped raining.

953
01:21:35,641 --> 01:21:38,060
It's been years
since my last rainy season.

954
01:21:39,979 --> 01:21:42,315
No rainy season up north?

955
01:21:45,443 --> 01:21:49,530
I hear you still make plum wine
every year.

956
01:21:49,655 --> 01:21:51,949
Auntie's really impressed.

957
01:21:53,910 --> 01:21:57,788
Helping to make it every year
was such a chore,

958
01:21:57,914 --> 01:22:02,668
but when we were done,
I knew it was summer.

959
01:22:05,671 --> 01:22:08,174
Do you want to take some with you?

960
01:22:09,508 --> 01:22:12,345
Wait at the station.
I'll be right back.

961
01:22:13,596 --> 01:22:16,891
Be careful not to slip!

962
01:22:17,016 --> 01:22:18,476
I'm fine!

963
01:22:43,125 --> 01:22:44,877
Sorry to keep you.

964
01:22:48,547 --> 01:22:51,842
This is from this year's batch,
and that's from Grandma's batch.

965
01:22:51,968 --> 01:22:54,136
There's still some left?

966
01:22:54,971 --> 01:22:57,056
That's the last of it.

967
01:23:00,226 --> 01:23:02,103
Beautiful colour.

968
01:23:03,604 --> 01:23:05,523
Brings back memories.

969
01:23:06,857 --> 01:23:09,151
I'll really savour it.

970
01:23:11,153 --> 01:23:13,906
- See you.
- Come back more often.

971
01:23:14,991 --> 01:23:18,369
I'm sure Yoshino and Chika
wanted to talk to you more.

972
01:23:24,583 --> 01:23:26,877
You should visit us, too.

973
01:23:31,966 --> 01:23:33,426
See you.

974
01:24:54,882 --> 01:24:56,634
It's so big.

975
01:24:58,260 --> 01:25:00,346
Food's ready.

976
01:25:08,062 --> 01:25:09,438
How is it?

977
01:25:10,940 --> 01:25:12,650
Tasty.

978
01:25:13,984 --> 01:25:16,529
It might taste even better
with some cheese.

979
01:25:16,654 --> 01:25:19,490
You're right. I'll try that next time.

980
01:25:23,452 --> 01:25:26,622
My sisters don't like it very much,

981
01:25:26,747 --> 01:25:29,333
but sometimes I get a craving for it.

982
01:25:32,294 --> 01:25:36,590
I was too little to remember
Mum's seafood curry very much.

983
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:40,010
That's why...

984
01:25:40,136 --> 01:25:43,973
...for me, curry is Grandma's
fish-sticks curry.

985
01:25:45,933 --> 01:25:48,102
This reminds you of Grandma.

986
01:25:55,985 --> 01:25:57,361
Chika?

987
01:26:00,322 --> 01:26:02,449
I told a lie.

988
01:26:02,575 --> 01:26:03,993
What?

989
01:26:05,327 --> 01:26:07,454
Whitebait over rice.

990
01:26:07,580 --> 01:26:11,792
Actually, Dad used to make it
for me a lot in Sendai.

991
01:26:11,917 --> 01:26:15,921
I see, so that reminds you of Dad.

992
01:26:19,258 --> 01:26:22,344
I don't remember much about him.

993
01:26:23,429 --> 01:26:27,141
I remembered a little bit
when you showed us his photos.

994
01:26:29,768 --> 01:26:33,063
You have lots more memories of him
than I do.

995
01:26:33,189 --> 01:26:34,857
Good ones.

996
01:26:34,982 --> 01:26:37,234
And maybe bad ones, too.

997
01:26:41,238 --> 01:26:43,866
Tell me sometime about Dad.

998
01:26:57,588 --> 01:26:59,673
He loved fishing.

999
01:27:00,466 --> 01:27:02,218
Fishing? Really?

1000
01:27:03,761 --> 01:27:08,390
On weekends, he always went to the river.
He took me with him sometimes.

1001
01:27:22,279 --> 01:27:27,910
So to keep the cafe, you need to pay
your brother 12 million yen.

1002
01:27:28,035 --> 01:27:34,124
Your personal assets for all
your accounts are 6 million yen.

1003
01:27:34,250 --> 01:27:36,543
If our bank loans you
6 million yen...

1004
01:27:36,669 --> 01:27:38,504
Sorry...

1005
01:27:41,340 --> 01:27:45,928
Actually, I'm closing the cafe
at the end of the month.

1006
01:27:50,683 --> 01:27:54,270
Physically, I'm not doing so well.

1007
01:27:58,274 --> 01:28:03,529
But honestly, I never thought
this would happen so quickly.

1008
01:28:05,698 --> 01:28:09,451
So you're going to focus
on your medical treatment?

1009
01:28:11,036 --> 01:28:14,748
No.
I'm having no more treatment.

1010
01:28:16,208 --> 01:28:20,379
You know about the new
terminal care ward in the hospital?

1011
01:28:21,922 --> 01:28:24,049
I have a bed reserved.

1012
01:28:26,260 --> 01:28:31,849
Even if we lose this place, I'm going
to serve her fried mackerel at my cafe.

1013
01:28:33,726 --> 01:28:37,396
At least her brother can't lay claim
to her recipes.

1014
01:28:46,196 --> 01:28:50,075
That makes me so mad
at whoever God is.

1015
01:28:51,869 --> 01:28:54,955
And why did it have to be her
of all people?

1016
01:29:06,508 --> 01:29:07,968
Well, then...

1017
01:29:09,345 --> 01:29:11,430
Time to draft a new proposal.

1018
01:29:15,934 --> 01:29:18,395
I think she should make a will.

1019
01:29:20,606 --> 01:29:22,232
A will?

1020
01:29:22,358 --> 01:29:26,320
A brother like that, I bet he won't
even pay for her funeral.

1021
01:29:29,531 --> 01:29:32,785
Then she needs a formal will.

1022
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:37,831
That way, even if she can't protect
her mother's estate,

1023
01:29:37,956 --> 01:29:41,210
at least her own wishes
will be protected.

1024
01:29:42,002 --> 01:29:43,504
Let's do that.

1025
01:29:45,422 --> 01:29:49,468
If God can't figure things out,
then we have to.

1026
01:30:05,651 --> 01:30:08,654
He was so stable yesterday.

1027
01:30:09,363 --> 01:30:11,365
He died so quickly.

1028
01:30:11,490 --> 01:30:15,786
You never know what will happen
with patients in the terminal phase.

1029
01:30:17,037 --> 01:30:20,082
Thank you, Sachi.
You really helped.

1030
01:30:22,418 --> 01:30:25,254
I was so surprised.

1031
01:30:27,631 --> 01:30:30,342
That Arai was so gentle with him.

1032
01:30:31,301 --> 01:30:32,678
Arai?

1033
01:30:35,681 --> 01:30:38,392
She treated him
like he was still alive.

1034
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:40,811
Saying, "Farewell now."

1035
01:30:41,603 --> 01:30:44,273
"It must have hurt."

1036
01:30:44,398 --> 01:30:46,191
"I'll be gentle with you."

1037
01:30:46,900 --> 01:30:50,195
She put so much care
into every step of the procedure.

1038
01:30:52,322 --> 01:30:54,450
I didn't notice at all.

1039
01:30:58,579 --> 01:31:01,415
<i>Tanabe, on our ward
is like that, too.</i>

1040
01:31:01,540 --> 01:31:04,001
He's useless most of the time,

1041
01:31:04,126 --> 01:31:07,880
but the patients trust him more
than any of us and tell him secrets.

1042
01:31:10,591 --> 01:31:15,304
I think I always focus
on people's uselessness.

1043
01:31:15,429 --> 01:31:19,475
But you hold yourself to the same
high standards, I admire you.

1044
01:31:20,100 --> 01:31:22,227
I was always the class president.

1045
01:31:25,606 --> 01:31:27,483
Do you chew your chopsticks?

1046
01:31:28,734 --> 01:31:30,527
The tips are ragged.

1047
01:31:32,613 --> 01:31:36,158
My mum used to tell me the same thing
when I was a kid.

1048
01:31:36,950 --> 01:31:40,120
I found a nice pair of chopsticks
at the store the other day.

1049
01:31:40,245 --> 01:31:42,539
You bought them for me?

1050
01:31:43,540 --> 01:31:45,751
Why not? You should have.

1051
01:31:47,336 --> 01:31:51,798
Buying chopsticks for a man is
something you have to think about,

1052
01:31:51,924 --> 01:31:53,634
if you're a woman.

1053
01:31:53,759 --> 01:31:56,303
Oh, I see...

1054
01:31:58,055 --> 01:32:01,725
I should be going home.
I work the day shift tomorrow.

1055
01:32:06,271 --> 01:32:07,648
Sachi...

1056
01:32:07,773 --> 01:32:10,108
I'm thinking of going to America.

1057
01:32:12,945 --> 01:32:15,989
My advisor from my residency
is in Boston.

1058
01:32:16,490 --> 01:32:19,409
He can teach me the latest treatments
for paediatric cancer.

1059
01:32:22,204 --> 01:32:23,997
Come with me.

1060
01:32:27,793 --> 01:32:29,294
But...

1061
01:32:30,963 --> 01:32:32,965
I'll divorce my wife.

1062
01:32:34,299 --> 01:32:38,095
I'm sorry to bring it up
so suddenly, but...

1063
01:32:39,221 --> 01:32:42,307
I've been thinking about it
for a long time.

1064
01:33:08,917 --> 01:33:10,627
This won't work.

1065
01:33:11,670 --> 01:33:14,506
- Not drinking?
- After I'm done.

1066
01:33:14,631 --> 01:33:18,343
It's strange that you're more
interested in work than drinking.

1067
01:33:22,264 --> 01:33:23,515
Welcome home.

1068
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:25,434
- Evening.
- Welcome back.

1069
01:33:32,065 --> 01:33:34,401
- Pears.
- It's a guy.

1070
01:33:35,611 --> 01:33:39,323
She bought lots of apples
when she got dumped before.

1071
01:33:39,448 --> 01:33:42,034
Oh, I remember.

1072
01:33:43,535 --> 01:33:47,247
- I wonder what he's like.
- I wonder what's up.

1073
01:33:52,085 --> 01:33:54,296
How would you understand?

1074
01:33:59,843 --> 01:34:03,805
His wife's illness preventing him
from getting a divorce is just an excuse.

1075
01:34:08,101 --> 01:34:11,480
But can't you understand
he doesn't want to abandon her?

1076
01:34:11,605 --> 01:34:16,443
But you two got involved anyway.
That's not kindness.

1077
01:34:17,235 --> 01:34:19,946
He's doing the same thing
that Dad did.

1078
01:34:20,072 --> 01:34:22,199
He's a weak and useless man.

1079
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:32,793
Dealing with someone who's clinically
depressed is a real challenge.

1080
01:34:34,836 --> 01:34:37,005
You don't know
what you're talking about.

1081
01:34:43,887 --> 01:34:47,599
Don't stay up too late just
because you're on summer holiday.

1082
01:34:51,645 --> 01:34:54,815
- Where are you going, Yotchan?
- Who cares?

1083
01:34:57,150 --> 01:34:58,694
Wait!

1084
01:34:58,819 --> 01:35:00,696
What is it?

1085
01:35:00,821 --> 01:35:03,824
- I may have hurt Sachi.
- How?

1086
01:35:03,949 --> 01:35:08,829
I told her that falling in love with
a married man makes you a bad person.

1087
01:35:08,954 --> 01:35:11,540
- Don't worry.
- I want the three of us to talk!

1088
01:35:11,665 --> 01:35:13,166
About Sachi!

1089
01:35:13,291 --> 01:35:15,168
Yes, let's do that.

1090
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:18,964
What a pain!

1091
01:35:19,881 --> 01:35:22,926
Chika! Plum wine on the rocks!

1092
01:35:23,051 --> 01:35:25,470
I'll mix it.

1093
01:35:29,141 --> 01:35:30,600
Knock-knock.

1094
01:35:32,894 --> 01:35:34,312
What?

1095
01:35:37,774 --> 01:35:40,318
Can I come in? It's about work.

1096
01:35:44,656 --> 01:35:46,116
Sure.

1097
01:35:53,290 --> 01:35:58,628
You've seen a lot of people die
at your job, right?

1098
01:35:59,087 --> 01:36:01,757
I'm wondering what that's like.

1099
01:36:01,882 --> 01:36:06,136
If you got emotional about everything,
you couldn't do your job, right?

1100
01:36:11,975 --> 01:36:17,022
But it's not like I can just
block it out and forget about it.

1101
01:36:18,315 --> 01:36:19,691
Right.

1102
01:36:21,359 --> 01:36:23,028
I feel better.

1103
01:36:24,154 --> 01:36:26,698
It's not like it's better
to get used to it.

1104
01:36:27,157 --> 01:36:31,578
I don't think I should ever
get used to losing a patient.

1105
01:36:34,956 --> 01:36:36,833
Thanks for the lesson.

1106
01:36:39,753 --> 01:36:41,379
I like this.

1107
01:36:42,214 --> 01:36:44,132
Then it's yours.

1108
01:36:45,217 --> 01:36:47,344
It's not your dress for dates?

1109
01:36:47,469 --> 01:36:50,430
I don't have to rely on outfits
to win when I want to.

1110
01:36:54,059 --> 01:36:55,560
Thanks.

1111
01:36:59,064 --> 01:37:00,941
Listen, sis.

1112
01:37:01,066 --> 01:37:03,151
Don't worry about this house.

1113
01:37:03,944 --> 01:37:08,156
Chika and I can look after Suzu.

1114
01:37:09,699 --> 01:37:11,827
It's not like it used to be.

1115
01:37:17,624 --> 01:37:19,084
Thanks.

1116
01:37:21,294 --> 01:37:25,090
Otherwise, you'll turn into a mum
before you're married.

1117
01:37:25,799 --> 01:37:28,134
You're right, I'll try not to.

1118
01:37:28,260 --> 01:37:31,638
Please, you've got your sisters
waiting behind you.

1119
01:37:34,224 --> 01:37:37,602
You should say that to me
before you're drunk.

1120
01:37:38,687 --> 01:37:42,899
How could I bring it up
when I'm sober?

1121
01:38:46,796 --> 01:38:49,507
Suzu, the fireworks are tonight, right?

1122
01:38:50,759 --> 01:38:52,260
Wait a minute.

1123
01:39:05,482 --> 01:39:07,275
Oh, a summer kimono.

1124
01:39:08,109 --> 01:39:12,739
- The pattern looks good on Suzu.
- Right? Just like I told you.

1125
01:39:12,864 --> 01:39:14,741
It fits her perfectly, too.

1126
01:39:14,866 --> 01:39:17,202
- Was this yours?
- Yes, it was.

1127
01:39:18,370 --> 01:39:20,664
- You can have it.
- Really?

1128
01:39:20,789 --> 01:39:22,374
Of course.

1129
01:39:22,499 --> 01:39:25,418
- Show it to Futa.
- To Futa?

1130
01:39:25,543 --> 01:39:27,212
Who's that? Is he good-looking?

1131
01:39:27,337 --> 01:39:29,047
Cool...

1132
01:39:30,507 --> 01:39:32,217
He seems honest.

1133
01:39:33,093 --> 01:39:34,844
Honesty is always best.

1134
01:39:34,970 --> 01:39:36,346
Oh, yeah?

1135
01:39:36,805 --> 01:39:39,557
My soccer uniform's fine.
Some other time.

1136
01:39:40,558 --> 01:39:44,437
This was Grandma's.
It brings back memories.

1137
01:39:44,562 --> 01:39:46,231
What are you doing?

1138
01:39:47,232 --> 01:39:49,526
It smells like Grandma.

1139
01:39:49,651 --> 01:39:52,654
Does it? Let me, let me.

1140
01:39:59,452 --> 01:40:01,162
It does not.

1141
01:40:18,054 --> 01:40:19,139
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1142
01:40:20,348 --> 01:40:22,267
<i>I can't go with you.</i>

1143
01:40:24,227 --> 01:40:26,354
I knew you'd say that.

1144
01:40:30,275 --> 01:40:33,611
It's my fault for taking so long
to make up my mind.

1145
01:40:36,281 --> 01:40:37,866
It's mine, too.

1146
01:40:38,783 --> 01:40:40,827
It's not anyone's fault.

1147
01:40:45,248 --> 01:40:50,170
I want to get serious
about working in terminal care.

1148
01:40:53,214 --> 01:40:54,674
I see.

1149
01:40:58,803 --> 01:41:03,683
Apparently my father said
he couldn't face us at the end.

1150
01:41:06,102 --> 01:41:10,148
That's why Suzu had to care for him
all by herself.

1151
01:41:12,525 --> 01:41:17,405
If I'd been by their side,
I might've been of some help...

1152
01:41:19,491 --> 01:41:22,994
...to my father and to Suzu.

1153
01:41:27,123 --> 01:41:30,835
She's been through a lot.

1154
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:34,923
She had her childhood
stolen from her.

1155
01:41:35,048 --> 01:41:37,342
The same thing happened to you.

1156
01:41:41,471 --> 01:41:45,683
Your childhood was stolen, too.
By the adults in your life.

1157
01:41:48,144 --> 01:41:49,646
You think so?

1158
01:41:53,108 --> 01:41:55,944
You should take it back, gradually.

1159
01:41:57,487 --> 01:41:59,989
Even though I can't help you.

1160
01:42:05,453 --> 01:42:06,704
I'm off.

1161
01:43:04,387 --> 01:43:06,431
Thanks for the meal!

1162
01:43:08,224 --> 01:43:09,392
Delicious.

1163
01:43:09,517 --> 01:43:12,520
That's the last time we'll be able
to eat your fried mackerel.

1164
01:43:12,645 --> 01:43:15,398
I'm sorry.
I'm open till the end of the month.

1165
01:43:16,733 --> 01:43:17,942
We'll be back.

1166
01:43:18,067 --> 01:43:19,444
Suzu-chan...

1167
01:43:19,569 --> 01:43:20,820
Thanks again!

1168
01:43:20,945 --> 01:43:25,450
Sorry for the trouble,
but take this marinated mackerel home.

1169
01:43:25,992 --> 01:43:27,660
Yotchan's favourite.

1170
01:43:28,745 --> 01:43:30,830
Say to her,
"Thank you for everything."

1171
01:43:31,956 --> 01:43:34,042
Yes, I will.

1172
01:43:43,968 --> 01:43:48,598
I'm jealous of your father and mother.

1173
01:43:52,227 --> 01:43:53,686
Why's that?

1174
01:43:55,146 --> 01:43:56,648
Because...

1175
01:43:57,607 --> 01:44:02,654
...they left a treasure like you
behind on this earth.

1176
01:44:06,991 --> 01:44:09,494
I'm not a treasure.

1177
01:44:15,875 --> 01:44:20,338
Don't say that.
Or the gods will spite you.

1178
01:44:23,049 --> 01:44:26,135
Now, go and enjoy yourself.

1179
01:44:27,637 --> 01:44:31,307
It's really beautiful when the fireworks
are reflected on the sea.

1180
01:44:32,183 --> 01:44:33,643
See you soon.

1181
01:44:34,352 --> 01:44:36,354
Thank you for the food.

1182
01:44:36,479 --> 01:44:38,606
Come again!

1183
01:44:55,081 --> 01:44:56,541
Careful, Suzu.

1184
01:45:00,837 --> 01:45:02,338
Pass me that.

1185
01:45:19,188 --> 01:45:20,398
Amazing!

1186
01:45:25,737 --> 01:45:27,447
Wow, they're so big!

1187
01:45:27,572 --> 01:45:29,490
It's close!

1188
01:45:30,867 --> 01:45:32,618
Amazing!

1189
01:45:32,744 --> 01:45:36,164
How sad we're watching them
from our bank's roof.

1190
01:45:36,289 --> 01:45:38,249
You're right.

1191
01:45:38,374 --> 01:45:41,252
Without overtime, you could've
watched them with your boyfriend.

1192
01:45:41,377 --> 01:45:43,421
I know.

1193
01:45:47,091 --> 01:45:50,011
- Long day.
- Long day for you, too.

1194
01:45:51,512 --> 01:45:53,681
So cute.

1195
01:45:54,474 --> 01:45:56,100
It's a heart.

1196
01:46:16,579 --> 01:46:19,207
Do you want to climb mountains again?

1197
01:46:22,126 --> 01:46:23,795
I've had enough.

1198
01:46:26,756 --> 01:46:29,634
Then let's go carp fishing.

1199
01:46:33,304 --> 01:46:35,014
You want to?

1200
01:46:35,973 --> 01:46:37,683
Like this?

1201
01:46:37,809 --> 01:46:40,812
As soon as the float starts sinking,
go for it!

1202
01:46:43,439 --> 01:46:45,525
Like this?

1203
01:46:45,650 --> 01:46:46,943
Like this.

1204
01:46:47,985 --> 01:46:49,821
- Gently?
- Yes, gently.

1205
01:46:56,452 --> 01:46:59,080
Is it all right for me to be here?

1206
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,044
What are you talking about?

1207
01:47:07,004 --> 01:47:11,217
When I lived in Sendai,
and when I lived in Yamagata,

1208
01:47:11,342 --> 01:47:13,052
I always thought...

1209
01:47:15,638 --> 01:47:19,475
...someone's always hurting
just because I exist.

1210
01:47:22,019 --> 01:47:23,479
Sometimes...

1211
01:47:24,439 --> 01:47:26,983
...it becomes unbearable.

1212
01:47:34,282 --> 01:47:37,994
I'm the youngest of three brothers.

1213
01:47:39,203 --> 01:47:42,582
Both my parents had
really wanted a girl,

1214
01:47:42,707 --> 01:47:44,792
but I was another boy.

1215
01:47:46,210 --> 01:47:48,588
They were both disappointed.

1216
01:47:50,047 --> 01:47:54,260
That's why I'm the only one
with so few photos.

1217
01:47:59,140 --> 01:48:01,726
That's not what
you were talking about?

1218
01:48:02,852 --> 01:48:04,729
That's what we're talking about.

1219
01:48:17,742 --> 01:48:19,243
See you.

1220
01:48:20,661 --> 01:48:21,871
Asano...

1221
01:48:26,751 --> 01:48:29,921
You look pretty good
in that summer kimono.

1222
01:48:35,968 --> 01:48:37,428
Goodnight.

1223
01:48:39,096 --> 01:48:40,932
Till tomorrow.

1224
01:48:52,109 --> 01:48:53,361
I'm back.

1225
01:48:53,486 --> 01:48:55,780
Welcome home!

1226
01:48:57,198 --> 01:48:59,492
How did the boys like your kimono?

1227
01:48:59,617 --> 01:49:01,827
- No big deal.
- You're blushing!

1228
01:49:01,953 --> 01:49:05,874
- What are you all dressed up for?
- Let's have fireworks.

1229
01:49:05,998 --> 01:49:07,666
She's wearing Grandma's.

1230
01:49:07,792 --> 01:49:11,128
- It's a little conservative.
- Perfect for you.

1231
01:49:12,672 --> 01:49:16,133
- Fireworks, just for the four of us.
- Yes, let's.

1232
01:49:22,974 --> 01:49:24,308
Watch out!

1233
01:49:24,892 --> 01:49:26,227
All done.

1234
01:49:31,232 --> 01:49:32,817
Looks so pretty.

1235
01:49:36,821 --> 01:49:38,406
So lively.

1236
01:51:01,614 --> 01:51:02,823
Hey!

1237
01:51:03,324 --> 01:51:06,327
What if someone came by?

1238
01:51:14,418 --> 01:51:17,505
Do you like it sweet or sour,
Sachi?

1239
01:51:17,630 --> 01:51:19,256
Sour!

1240
01:51:21,509 --> 01:51:23,552
Strong or weak?

1241
01:51:23,678 --> 01:51:24,887
Strong!

1242
01:51:45,741 --> 01:51:47,743
We did a good job,
for our first try.

1243
01:51:50,538 --> 01:51:52,081
Want to try it?

1244
01:51:54,583 --> 01:51:55,668
Thanks.

1245
01:52:01,465 --> 01:52:03,050
It's sour!

1246
01:52:03,175 --> 01:52:04,677
You're still a child.

1247
01:52:04,802 --> 01:52:06,387
Compared to you, I am.

1248
01:52:06,512 --> 01:52:08,139
Don't be cheeky.

1249
01:52:08,681 --> 01:52:10,474
You initialled this plum.

1250
01:52:14,061 --> 01:52:17,690
- You initialled this "C-H-l" plum.
- No, that's Chika's.

1251
01:52:17,815 --> 01:52:19,358
No way!

1252
01:52:19,483 --> 01:52:20,776
Stab!

1253
01:52:24,363 --> 01:52:27,950
Sachi at 3, Chika at 3,

1254
01:52:28,075 --> 01:52:29,744
Yotchan at 3,

1255
01:52:30,202 --> 01:52:33,664
Yotchan at 5, Sachi at 6,

1256
01:52:34,749 --> 01:52:36,417
Sachi at 9,

1257
01:52:37,501 --> 01:52:38,919
Chika at 11...

1258
01:52:39,712 --> 01:52:41,505
Chika at 12,

1259
01:52:42,923 --> 01:52:44,592
Chika at 13.

1260
01:52:44,717 --> 01:52:46,677
Yotchan at 14,

1261
01:52:47,970 --> 01:52:49,680
Sachi at 15.

1262
01:52:53,851 --> 01:52:55,853
I guess you're a little smaller.

1263
01:52:59,774 --> 01:53:01,650
Hey, no cheating!

1264
01:53:09,950 --> 01:53:11,118
"Suzu...

1265
01:53:12,453 --> 01:53:14,121
"15 years old."

1266
01:53:22,671 --> 01:53:25,341
SUZU AT 15

1267
01:53:54,662 --> 01:53:56,163
Are you all right?

1268
01:53:57,665 --> 01:53:59,792
I don't remember climbing so far.

1269
01:54:00,459 --> 01:54:02,294
Is this the right way?

1270
01:54:03,671 --> 01:54:06,048
What if we can't make it home?

1271
01:54:13,180 --> 01:54:15,057
Here it is.

1272
01:54:35,995 --> 01:54:37,329
You're right.

1273
01:54:38,247 --> 01:54:40,666
It looks like that other view.

1274
01:54:43,294 --> 01:54:46,255
When I was little,
I came here with Dad a lot.

1275
01:54:47,673 --> 01:54:50,676
And after he left, I came alone.

1276
01:55:03,689 --> 01:55:05,316
You try, too, Suzu.

1277
01:55:06,734 --> 01:55:07,943
I'm fine.

1278
01:55:08,694 --> 01:55:09,987
Come on.

1279
01:55:29,590 --> 01:55:32,176
Dad's an idiot!

1280
01:55:46,690 --> 01:55:49,944
Mum's an idiot!

1281
01:55:57,201 --> 01:55:58,702
I wanted...

1282
01:56:02,498 --> 01:56:04,875
...to spend more time with her.

1283
01:56:16,762 --> 01:56:21,433
You can talk about your mother.

1284
01:56:33,028 --> 01:56:35,447
You can stay right here.

1285
01:56:35,572 --> 01:56:37,157
Forever.

1286
01:56:45,082 --> 01:56:46,959
I want to.

1287
01:56:47,751 --> 01:56:49,128
Forever.

1288
01:57:14,028 --> 01:57:16,155
Everybody head straight home.

1289
01:57:19,241 --> 01:57:20,492
See you.

1290
01:57:20,617 --> 01:57:22,036
Tomorrow.

1291
01:57:37,217 --> 01:57:39,094
That was a good funeral.

1292
01:57:43,891 --> 01:57:45,976
She led a good life.

1293
01:57:49,521 --> 01:57:53,901
With you by her side,
I'm sure she went peacefully.

1294
01:57:59,698 --> 01:58:04,161
In her photo,
she looked so good.

1295
01:58:07,539 --> 01:58:09,416
She looked pretty.

1296
01:58:10,626 --> 01:58:12,836
You took that picture, right?

1297
01:58:15,089 --> 01:58:18,050
That was on our last date.

1298
01:58:20,219 --> 01:58:23,305
The cherry blossoms are
from that boulevard, right?

1299
01:58:27,226 --> 01:58:29,853
Even in the hospital,
she used to say,

1300
01:58:30,896 --> 01:58:34,858
"Those cherry blossoms
were so pretty, then."

1301
01:58:37,486 --> 01:58:40,531
Even when she knew
she was going to die soon...

1302
01:58:41,365 --> 01:58:45,869
"I'm so happy that beauty
still looks beautiful to me."

1303
01:58:47,121 --> 01:58:48,997
That's what she said.

1304
01:59:08,100 --> 01:59:09,309
Suzu-chan...

1305
01:59:13,397 --> 01:59:16,400
If you want to hear stories
about your dad,

1306
01:59:16,525 --> 01:59:18,610
come secretly to the cafe.

1307
01:59:20,946 --> 01:59:23,699
Yes, I will.

1308
01:59:51,768 --> 01:59:54,813
Dad said the same thing.

1309
01:59:54,938 --> 01:59:58,025
Before he died,
about the cherry blossoms.

1310
01:59:58,650 --> 02:00:03,280
That he was happy
that beauty still moved him.

1311
02:00:06,074 --> 02:00:08,160
He must've had a good life.

1312
02:00:15,459 --> 02:00:18,295
I wonder what I'll remember
at the end.

1313
02:00:20,631 --> 02:00:25,260
I'll remember men...
Or drinking, I guess.

1314
02:00:26,470 --> 02:00:27,971
Typical of you!

1315
02:00:28,096 --> 02:00:29,473
You, Sachi?

1316
02:00:30,432 --> 02:00:31,975
I wonder...

1317
02:00:34,895 --> 02:00:37,105
Maybe the garden veranda.

1318
02:00:38,398 --> 02:00:42,402
At this rate, you'll never
get married and move out.

1319
02:00:47,115 --> 02:00:48,867
Ask me, too.

1320
02:00:48,992 --> 02:00:51,370
You have strange tastes.

1321
02:00:51,495 --> 02:00:52,913
You're mean.

1322
02:00:56,208 --> 02:00:57,668
You, Suzu?

1323
02:00:58,377 --> 02:01:00,754
I have a lot. I made a lot.

1324
02:01:00,879 --> 02:01:02,965
But you're still a kid.

1325
02:01:03,090 --> 02:01:05,300
Compared to all of you.

1326
02:01:06,093 --> 02:01:07,761
There you go again.

1327
02:01:07,886 --> 02:01:11,598
In 50 years,
we'll all be old grandmas.

1328
02:01:11,723 --> 02:01:13,642
Sounds like fun.

1329
02:01:23,610 --> 02:01:24,820
Dad...

1330
02:01:26,697 --> 02:01:28,740
...was really useless.

1331
02:01:29,825 --> 02:01:31,952
But maybe he was a kind man.

1332
02:01:34,037 --> 02:01:35,122
Why?

1333
02:01:36,748 --> 02:01:41,753
Because he left us
such a lovely little sister.

1334
02:01:45,299 --> 02:01:46,550
Right.

1335
02:01:47,467 --> 02:01:49,428
You're right.

1336
02:01:49,553 --> 02:01:51,471
I'm sure you're right.

1337
02:01:52,848 --> 02:01:55,559
What? Did you say something?

1338
02:01:57,561 --> 02:01:59,229
Nothing at all.

1339
02:02:18,707 --> 02:02:20,542
Careful, Chika.
