1
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:25,792
The characters depicted in this film
are entirely fictitious,

2
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:29,584
any similarity to actual persons,
living or dead,

3
00:00:29,751 --> 00:00:33,126
is purely coincidental.

4
00:00:39,459 --> 00:00:42,459
THE PHANTOM OF LIBERTY

5
00:00:45,792 --> 00:00:48,584
The film begins in Toledo, in 1808,

6
00:00:48,751 --> 00:00:52,334
during the city's occupation
by Napoleon's army.

7
00:00:52,501 --> 00:00:55,917
It is inspired by a story
written by Gustavo A. Bécquer,

8
00:00:56,084 --> 00:00:58,459
the Spanish romantic poet.

9
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:02,084
Platoon, halt!

10
00:02:03,084 --> 00:02:05,251
Right!

11
00:02:19,292 --> 00:02:21,917
Prisoners against the wall.

12
00:02:26,667 --> 00:02:29,584
First row, kneel.

13
00:02:31,167 --> 00:02:33,126
Platoon, ready, aim...

14
00:02:33,292 --> 00:02:35,209
<i>Down with liberty!</i>

15
00:02:35,376 --> 00:02:37,001
<i>Death to the traitors!</i>

16
00:02:38,376 --> 00:02:39,542
...fire!

17
00:02:51,917 --> 00:02:54,959
First row, kneel.

18
00:02:56,334 --> 00:02:58,959
Platoon, ready, aim,

19
00:02:59,417 --> 00:03:00,459
fire!

20
00:03:27,167 --> 00:03:28,584
I'm hungry.

21
00:03:50,334 --> 00:03:51,376
Come.

22
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:29,501
<i>Despite his wound.
and to get revenge against the knight.</i>

23
00:04:29,667 --> 00:04:32,834
<i>the captain bet his fellow officers</i>

24
00:04:33,001 --> 00:04:37,626
<i>that he would have</i> Doña <i>Elvira's
mortal remains brought to his bed.</i>

25
00:04:38,292 --> 00:04:41,042
<i>Nothing could deter him from his intent.</i>

26
00:04:41,209 --> 00:04:44,917
<i>and one night
he carried out his macabre plan.</i>

27
00:04:59,751 --> 00:05:04,542
<i>"The ineffable hand of death
had spared her face.</i>

28
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:09,542
<i>"which had remained as fresh
and delicate as a rose.</i>

29
00:05:10,334 --> 00:05:15,501
"They found her beneath her tombstone
amid her vile paraphernalia..."

30
00:05:15,667 --> 00:05:17,126
- What is that?
- What?

31
00:05:17,292 --> 00:05:19,126
Paraphernalia.

32
00:05:19,292 --> 00:05:21,667
- Is it a nice smelling herb?
- No.

33
00:05:21,834 --> 00:05:24,167
- Is it a rosary?
- Not that either.

34
00:05:24,334 --> 00:05:28,209
Paraphernalia is a legal term
for a married woman's personal property.

35
00:05:29,501 --> 00:05:33,917
But in English, "paraphernalia"
took on a much broader meaning.

36
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:39,084
It refers to any accessories,
belongings, personal items,

37
00:05:39,251 --> 00:05:42,709
even fishing gear or a sewing kit.

38
00:05:43,459 --> 00:05:46,584
- Where were you?
- We went biking over the bridge.

39
00:05:46,751 --> 00:05:49,501
- Now we're going to the slide.
- Go, but we're leaving soon.

40
00:05:49,667 --> 00:05:51,667
- We'll come get you.
- Okay.

41
00:06:31,334 --> 00:06:33,376
That was a good slide.

42
00:06:33,751 --> 00:06:37,334
- I think I know you. What's your name?
- Véronique.

43
00:06:37,501 --> 00:06:38,751
- And you?
- Valérie.

44
00:06:38,917 --> 00:06:41,209
Yes, of course.

45
00:06:41,917 --> 00:06:47,209
Since you are both so sweet,
I'm going to give you a nice gift.

46
00:06:47,376 --> 00:06:50,292
- Come with me, we'll go...
- We can't. Our bikes are that way.

47
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:52,584
Well, let's go.

48
00:07:07,042 --> 00:07:11,834
Now, I'm going to show you
some very pretty pictures.

49
00:07:13,584 --> 00:07:16,209
But you can't show them to anyone.

50
00:07:17,501 --> 00:07:20,251
If you want them, you have to promise.

51
00:07:25,542 --> 00:07:26,917
Look.

52
00:07:36,792 --> 00:07:40,417
They're yours.
Show them to all your little friends.

53
00:07:41,126 --> 00:07:44,251
But not to grownups. Don't forget.

54
00:08:04,334 --> 00:08:06,209
I'm sick of symmetry.

55
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:20,626
Harry?

56
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:22,876
Back already?

57
00:08:23,042 --> 00:08:25,417
What are you talking about?
I never went out.

58
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:28,792
Don't you feel well?

59
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:32,417
I don't know what's wrong with me.
I'm nervous, tired.

60
00:08:37,209 --> 00:08:41,001
That's true. I've noticed recently.

61
00:08:42,126 --> 00:08:44,542
We could take advantage of
Véronique's vacation

62
00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:46,542
to go to the seashore.

63
00:08:46,876 --> 00:08:50,042
Why the sea? The sea's no longer the sea.

64
00:08:52,917 --> 00:08:54,584
- Hello, Mum.
- Hello.

65
00:08:56,459 --> 00:08:57,709
Look what someone gave me.

66
00:08:57,876 --> 00:08:59,251
- What is it?
- Hi, Dad.

67
00:08:59,417 --> 00:09:03,667
I passed you on the street yesterday,
and you didn't even recognise me.

68
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,917
I've been sleeping so badly these days.

69
00:09:06,084 --> 00:09:09,792
I haven't told you,
but sometimes I lie awake all night.

70
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:13,001
You should get a check-up,
at least you'd be reassured.

71
00:09:13,167 --> 00:09:18,501
Why do you say "check-up"?
"General examination" is the French word.

72
00:09:18,667 --> 00:09:23,501
It's too long. "General examination".
"Check-up" is much quicker.

73
00:09:23,667 --> 00:09:25,376
What's the hurry?

74
00:09:30,126 --> 00:09:31,084
Françoise!

75
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:39,334
Come here.

76
00:09:41,084 --> 00:09:44,667
- Where did you get these?
- A nice man gave them to me.

77
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,626
So, you let her talk to strangers?

78
00:09:47,792 --> 00:09:50,501
I didn't see anything. I didn't know.

79
00:09:51,126 --> 00:09:53,876
The man seemed very nice.
He even offered us sweets.

80
00:09:54,042 --> 00:09:56,876
- Yes, sweets.
- I've warned you before.

81
00:09:57,417 --> 00:10:00,917
If you ever accept anything
from a stranger again,

82
00:10:01,084 --> 00:10:02,459
there will be trouble.

83
00:10:02,834 --> 00:10:05,251
- Time for her snack.
- Yes, madam.

84
00:10:14,584 --> 00:10:17,709
- Disgraceful.
- Let me see.

85
00:10:20,709 --> 00:10:24,167
- Can you imagine?
- Disgusting, but what can you do?

86
00:10:24,334 --> 00:10:28,751
I don't know what to do.
I can't always keep an eye on her.

87
00:10:29,084 --> 00:10:30,584
Look at this.

88
00:10:31,834 --> 00:10:34,542
- Remember? In Milan.
- Oh, yes.

89
00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:37,167
- At your parents' house.
- Yes.

90
00:10:37,334 --> 00:10:39,584
We were still too young.

91
00:10:39,917 --> 00:10:43,584
But it was great. And you didn't want to...

92
00:10:45,542 --> 00:10:47,584
Véronique might hear us.

93
00:11:00,417 --> 00:11:01,834
It's incredible.

94
00:11:04,126 --> 00:11:05,501
It's revolting.

95
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:11,542
- Sickening!
- What can you expect nowadays?

96
00:11:12,584 --> 00:11:15,792
- This one could pass.
- I guess.

97
00:11:18,209 --> 00:11:20,084
This one is obscene.

98
00:11:22,334 --> 00:11:25,584
That may be okay for old fogies,
but not for me.

99
00:11:32,376 --> 00:11:33,626
No, not this!

100
00:11:33,792 --> 00:11:35,834
- Let me see.
- What good would it do?

101
00:11:36,001 --> 00:11:37,334
- Why not?
- No!

102
00:11:37,501 --> 00:11:39,042
Let me see it.

103
00:11:46,167 --> 00:11:49,251
You're right. This is going too far.

104
00:11:53,084 --> 00:11:55,042
- Call the maid.
- Yes.

105
00:11:59,709 --> 00:12:01,084
Françoise.

106
00:12:03,834 --> 00:12:05,792
- Françoise.
- Yes, madam.

107
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:09,167
I think I'm going to skip dinner tonight
and go to bed early.

108
00:12:09,334 --> 00:12:11,876
You should see a doctor. I insist.

109
00:12:14,084 --> 00:12:16,917
- Here, you can keep them.
- Thanks, Daddy.

110
00:12:17,084 --> 00:12:20,876
- May I trade them for some spider pictures?
- If you like.

111
00:12:23,917 --> 00:12:25,376
You called, madam?

112
00:12:25,542 --> 00:12:28,626
After today's incident, it's best you leave us.

113
00:12:28,792 --> 00:12:31,751
But I had nothing to do with it.
I didn't know...

114
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:35,542
I don't want to discuss it right now.
Settle things with my wife, then get out.

115
00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:39,167
I'm sorry, but under the circumstances,
there's nothing I can do.

116
00:12:39,334 --> 00:12:42,542
- But, madam...
- Of course, you can stay the night.

117
00:12:42,709 --> 00:12:45,417
Come. Let's work out what we owe you.

118
00:12:48,876 --> 00:12:52,209
- This one's a water spider.
- Very good, darling.

119
00:12:54,792 --> 00:12:58,042
I drew that one. It's a wolf spider.

120
00:12:58,209 --> 00:13:00,709
No, darling, it's a trapdoor spider.

121
00:13:00,876 --> 00:13:04,042
A species you won't
find in France, unfortunately.

122
00:14:06,417 --> 00:14:07,667
Hélène.

123
00:15:35,959 --> 00:15:37,501
That's enough.

124
00:15:38,542 --> 00:15:40,459
That really is enough.

125
00:15:40,792 --> 00:15:45,167
I'm sorry, Mr Foucauld,
but this isn't my specialty.

126
00:15:45,334 --> 00:15:47,376
We're both wasting our time.

127
00:15:47,542 --> 00:15:49,167
So what should I do?

128
00:15:49,334 --> 00:15:52,292
Physically, there's nothing wrong with you.

129
00:15:52,626 --> 00:15:56,126
If you want to discuss your dreams,
see a psychoanalyst.

130
00:15:56,292 --> 00:15:59,917
He'll listen to you for months,
even years if necessary.

131
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:03,667
Doctor, it wasn't a dream.
I have the postman's letter.

132
00:16:03,834 --> 00:16:05,584
- Here, look.
- The letter?

133
00:16:14,126 --> 00:16:15,917
- Doctor?
- What is it?

134
00:16:16,084 --> 00:16:18,084
May I see you a moment?

135
00:16:18,667 --> 00:16:22,126
- Can't it wait?
- It's rather urgent.

136
00:16:25,042 --> 00:16:26,417
Excuse me.

137
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:35,792
My father is very sick.

138
00:16:37,834 --> 00:16:41,959
- What's wrong with him?
- He's already had two attacks. He's old.

139
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:46,501
- I'd very much like to go see him.
- We're very busy right now.

140
00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:49,626
Will you be away long?

141
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:52,792
A day or two,
I'll be back as soon as possible.

142
00:16:53,209 --> 00:16:56,001
- All right, then, go.
- Thank you, Doctor.

143
00:17:46,709 --> 00:17:49,209
Excuse me,
did you see any foxes on the road?

144
00:17:49,376 --> 00:17:51,334
Foxes? No.

145
00:17:52,001 --> 00:17:55,417
- No foxes crossing the road?
- I didn't see a thing.

146
00:17:56,501 --> 00:18:00,167
What did I tell you?
There are no foxes around here. Never were!

147
00:18:00,334 --> 00:18:03,751
I had first-hand information, sir.
Maybe it's the storm.

148
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:08,084
- And we still have 30 miles to go.
- We've wasted enough time! Let's go.

149
00:18:08,417 --> 00:18:11,417
Excuse me, are you going toward Argenton?

150
00:18:11,584 --> 00:18:12,626
Yes, sir.

151
00:18:13,417 --> 00:18:17,209
Be careful. I think there was a landslide
and the road may be out.

152
00:18:18,001 --> 00:18:20,792
- Goodbye, madam. Thank you.
- Goodbye.

153
00:18:24,834 --> 00:18:26,167
Move out!

154
00:19:15,167 --> 00:19:17,959
- Good evening, madam.
- Good evening, may I use your phone?

155
00:19:18,126 --> 00:19:21,751
- The line's down because of the floods.
- What will I do now?

156
00:19:21,917 --> 00:19:24,751
- Do you have a room?
- Of course. Front or back?

157
00:19:24,917 --> 00:19:26,626
It doesn't matter. I'm leaving early.

158
00:19:26,792 --> 00:19:30,584
- Would you like supper?
- No, just some milk and fruit.

159
00:19:31,084 --> 00:19:33,834
I'll just be a minute. Go and dry off.

160
00:19:38,834 --> 00:19:41,542
- Good evening.
- Good evening, madam.

161
00:19:46,292 --> 00:19:50,417
- What hellish weather!
- Apparently the road to Argenton is out.

162
00:19:50,584 --> 00:19:52,376
Have a seat, madam.

163
00:19:57,417 --> 00:19:59,584
We're stranded here, too.

164
00:19:59,751 --> 00:20:03,084
- Are you from around here?
- My family is. And you?

165
00:20:03,626 --> 00:20:06,459
We're from Saint Joseph's Monastery.
You must know it.

166
00:20:06,626 --> 00:20:08,876
I've been there with my father.

167
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:13,292
I'm going to see him. He's very sick.
Who knows if I'll find him alive.

168
00:20:14,167 --> 00:20:16,084
What's wrong with him?

169
00:20:16,709 --> 00:20:21,459
- I'm afraid for him.
- The heart. The disease of our times.

170
00:20:21,626 --> 00:20:25,126
The bustle, the anxiety, the travelling.

171
00:20:25,792 --> 00:20:28,792
My father runs a small farm.
He never travels.

172
00:20:28,959 --> 00:20:32,417
He doesn't read the papers.
He doesn't have a phone.

173
00:20:33,709 --> 00:20:36,209
If everybody prayed to Saint Joseph

174
00:20:36,876 --> 00:20:39,834
and took 30 minutes a day to meditate,

175
00:20:41,251 --> 00:20:45,001
- we'd all be perfectly relaxed.
- Surely.

176
00:20:47,626 --> 00:20:49,542
Whenever you're ready.

177
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:52,126
- Good night.
- Good night, madam.

178
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:53,334
Good night.

179
00:20:54,834 --> 00:20:56,209
This way, please.

180
00:21:23,501 --> 00:21:25,209
Excuse me, madam.

181
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,376
Would you like an extra blanket?
It's very humid.

182
00:21:35,542 --> 00:21:37,792
No, I sleep with the windows closed.

183
00:21:37,959 --> 00:21:39,709
- Is there hot water?
- Of course.

184
00:21:39,876 --> 00:21:42,209
- Shall I wake you in the morning?
- That won't be necessary.

185
00:21:42,376 --> 00:21:44,376
- Then good night, madam.
- Good night.

186
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:47,126
Who is it?

187
00:24:47,292 --> 00:24:50,084
It's Father Gabriel.
I'd like a word with you, please.

188
00:24:51,626 --> 00:24:53,167
Just a moment.

189
00:25:00,001 --> 00:25:02,167
Good evening, madam. May I?

190
00:25:05,376 --> 00:25:08,459
- Do you know what this is?
- Yes. It's an image.

191
00:25:08,626 --> 00:25:13,584
A miraculous image of Saint Joseph.
It can have surprising effects on the sick.

192
00:25:13,751 --> 00:25:16,501
- Really?
- I'm thinking of your father.

193
00:25:16,667 --> 00:25:20,292
Faith can sometimes triumph
where science has failed.

194
00:25:21,792 --> 00:25:24,459
We just saw the Marquise de la Pomarède.

195
00:25:24,626 --> 00:25:26,709
Yesterday she was near death.

196
00:25:26,876 --> 00:25:29,959
We brought her the image.

197
00:25:30,751 --> 00:25:32,126
We prayed.

198
00:25:33,292 --> 00:25:36,001
This morning when we left the castle...

199
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:39,084
- She was cured?
- She felt a little better.

200
00:25:41,792 --> 00:25:43,709
You play cards, madam?

201
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:46,167
Sometimes, when I'm alone.

202
00:25:46,834 --> 00:25:50,126
- I play solitaire.
- So do I. It's very relaxing.

203
00:25:50,959 --> 00:25:53,042
That must be the fathers.

204
00:25:58,584 --> 00:26:01,167
- Good evening, madam.
- Good evening.

205
00:26:05,126 --> 00:26:10,126
And now, with your permission,
we shall pray for your father.

206
00:26:10,292 --> 00:26:13,834
I don't know how to thank you.
I'm deeply touched.

207
00:26:20,584 --> 00:26:24,709
Madam, would you like a rosary?

208
00:26:25,376 --> 00:26:26,959
Yes, thank you.

209
00:26:35,834 --> 00:26:38,626
In the name of the Father, the Son
and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

210
00:26:38,792 --> 00:26:41,251
Let us meditate tonight
on the sorrowful mystery

211
00:26:41,417 --> 00:26:44,292
of Christ's agony on the Mount of Olives.

212
00:26:44,667 --> 00:26:47,334
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

213
00:26:47,501 --> 00:26:51,459
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.

214
00:26:51,626 --> 00:26:53,959
Give us this day our daily bread.

215
00:26:54,126 --> 00:26:58,042
And forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive those trespass against us.

216
00:26:58,209 --> 00:27:02,334
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil. Amen.

217
00:27:02,501 --> 00:27:04,626
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.

218
00:27:04,792 --> 00:27:08,042
Blessed art thou amongst women,
and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

219
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:10,376
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners

220
00:27:10,542 --> 00:27:13,251
now and at the hour of our death. Amen.

221
00:27:13,417 --> 00:27:15,334
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.

222
00:27:15,501 --> 00:27:18,709
Blessed art thou amongst women,
and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

223
00:27:18,876 --> 00:27:21,292
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners

224
00:27:21,459 --> 00:27:23,834
now and at the hour of our death. Amen.

225
00:27:24,001 --> 00:27:26,084
- I'm in.
- Raise you 10.

226
00:27:26,667 --> 00:27:29,709
- Pass.
- I'll see you and raise you a scapular.

227
00:27:36,376 --> 00:27:37,251
I open.

228
00:27:41,167 --> 00:27:43,084
- How many cards?
- Two.

229
00:27:43,251 --> 00:27:44,626
- None.
- Two.

230
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:51,042
Virgins are 10
and sacred hearts are 25, right?

231
00:27:51,209 --> 00:27:53,334
Yes, and scapulars are 50.

232
00:27:54,042 --> 00:27:55,917
I open with a virgin.

233
00:27:56,292 --> 00:27:58,167
- I'll see you.
- I'll see you.

234
00:27:58,334 --> 00:27:59,376
I'll see you.

235
00:27:59,876 --> 00:28:02,376
Full house, jacks over eights.

236
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:10,292
Didn't you say your father once lived
in the colonies?

237
00:28:10,459 --> 00:28:13,042
No. He never left these parts. Why?

238
00:28:13,376 --> 00:28:14,751
Oh, nothing.

239
00:28:14,917 --> 00:28:16,584
Place your bets.

240
00:28:19,042 --> 00:28:22,501
- She was so mischievous.
- Who?

241
00:28:22,917 --> 00:28:27,001
A pious lady who used to visit us.
Her husband was a military man.

242
00:28:27,917 --> 00:28:30,084
- And?
- Nothing, nothing.

243
00:28:30,251 --> 00:28:34,501
- Father Gabriel.
- I didn't say anything unusual.

244
00:28:38,376 --> 00:28:41,167
Those must be the late guests
I was expecting.

245
00:28:41,334 --> 00:28:43,501
If you'll excuse me.

246
00:28:47,501 --> 00:28:51,084
- Which is higher, a flush or a straight?
- A flush.

247
00:28:52,334 --> 00:28:53,584
Then I raise you 10.

248
00:29:12,126 --> 00:29:15,001
- Is our room ready?
- Yes. It's very nice.

249
00:29:15,334 --> 00:29:18,334
You have a view of the mountain.
Very quiet. You'll see.

250
00:29:18,959 --> 00:29:22,709
It's late, but if you want dinner,
a snack or a sandwich...

251
00:29:22,876 --> 00:29:25,792
No, thank you. The lady is tired.
We'll get some rest.

252
00:29:26,417 --> 00:29:28,334
Take their luggage up.

253
00:29:36,584 --> 00:29:37,792
Come.

254
00:29:45,459 --> 00:29:49,917
- What time would you like breakfast?
- We'll come down.

255
00:30:06,001 --> 00:30:08,751
Would madam like anything?
A bottle of mineral water?

256
00:30:09,084 --> 00:30:10,751
Nothing, thank you.

257
00:30:14,209 --> 00:30:15,626
Good night.

258
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:39,084
- What do you mean?
- That this is wonderful.

259
00:30:40,209 --> 00:30:42,501
Come sit next to me. Come on.

260
00:30:44,459 --> 00:30:47,459
- The things you make me do.
- Don't be nervous.

261
00:30:47,626 --> 00:30:50,209
You heard the man. It's very quiet here.

262
00:30:50,376 --> 00:30:52,251
- Too quiet.
- Sit down.

263
00:30:55,584 --> 00:30:57,501
Take off your glasses.

264
00:31:04,584 --> 00:31:07,751
What's wrong?
You seemed so happy about coming.

265
00:31:08,417 --> 00:31:11,459
- I shouldn't have listened to you.
- How I've waited for this.

266
00:31:11,626 --> 00:31:14,001
Please, François, take me home.

267
00:31:15,459 --> 00:31:19,417
- Why did you come then?
- Because I can't refuse you anything.

268
00:31:25,042 --> 00:31:29,209
For once we're alone,
without my mother, my brothers, my sisters.

269
00:31:30,376 --> 00:31:34,667
It had become unbearable,
having you near me, always having to lie.

270
00:31:34,834 --> 00:31:38,917
For me as well, François.
But how can we avoid lying?

271
00:31:45,042 --> 00:31:46,959
- Sit down here. Come.
- François.

272
00:31:47,126 --> 00:31:48,459
Come on.

273
00:31:50,959 --> 00:31:53,751
All my life, I've felt you close to me.

274
00:31:54,251 --> 00:31:56,501
Your perfume, your presence.

275
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:02,459
The times I held you on my lap
when you were a child.

276
00:32:03,376 --> 00:32:06,542
When I think of a woman,
it's always you I see.

277
00:32:07,501 --> 00:32:11,709
Of all my nephews,
I've always loved you the best.

278
00:32:18,542 --> 00:32:20,792
Remember that Holy Thursday,

279
00:32:20,959 --> 00:32:24,126
sitting side by side
in the dim light of the church?

280
00:32:24,834 --> 00:32:27,334
Your hand was resting on the pew.

281
00:32:27,876 --> 00:32:31,376
Gently, I put my hand on yours
and squeezed it.

282
00:32:32,626 --> 00:32:35,376
I felt your fingers close around mine.

283
00:32:35,959 --> 00:32:38,167
I didn't dare believe it.

284
00:32:38,334 --> 00:32:42,126
I waited for a moment, then I looked at you.

285
00:32:43,542 --> 00:32:46,292
You looked at me and leaned toward me,

286
00:32:47,792 --> 00:32:50,292
and we kissed for the first time.

287
00:32:51,417 --> 00:32:53,584
We couldn't help ourselves.

288
00:33:04,542 --> 00:33:05,834
No.

289
00:33:09,584 --> 00:33:11,459
I won't touch you.

290
00:33:11,626 --> 00:33:13,542
But there's one thing I want
more than anything.

291
00:33:13,709 --> 00:33:15,751
- What?
- To see you naked.

292
00:33:15,917 --> 00:33:17,126
Impossible.

293
00:33:17,292 --> 00:33:20,417
- I won't leave here until I do.
- I couldn't.

294
00:33:20,584 --> 00:33:25,292
I've never been naked in front of a man.
No man has ever touched me.

295
00:33:26,667 --> 00:33:28,584
Take off your clothes.

296
00:33:29,126 --> 00:33:32,209
If you refuse, you know I'll stop at nothing.

297
00:33:33,626 --> 00:33:34,834
Damn.

298
00:33:49,667 --> 00:33:51,834
Take off your clothes.

299
00:33:52,209 --> 00:33:54,584
- You promise you won't touch me?
- Yes.

300
00:33:56,084 --> 00:33:57,626
Lock the door.

301
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:05,626
Turn around.

302
00:34:27,251 --> 00:34:29,459
It's no use. I can't do it.

303
00:34:29,626 --> 00:34:31,834
- But you said...
- I said nothing!

304
00:34:32,001 --> 00:34:34,542
François, what's got into you?

305
00:34:34,709 --> 00:34:36,459
François, stop it! Stop it!

306
00:34:38,334 --> 00:34:41,542
- You swear you won't touch me?
- I swear.

307
00:34:44,001 --> 00:34:45,459
Turn around.

308
00:34:58,959 --> 00:35:01,542
What must they be thinking at home?

309
00:35:03,251 --> 00:35:05,376
They'll be waiting for us.

310
00:35:09,959 --> 00:35:13,251
You know your mother.
She's so easily worried.

311
00:35:15,209 --> 00:35:17,751
They may think we had an accident,

312
00:35:18,584 --> 00:35:21,251
what with the phone lines down and all.

313
00:35:22,584 --> 00:35:24,667
Well, too bad. We'll see.

314
00:35:34,459 --> 00:35:38,251
- Are you ready?
- You can turn around if you want.

315
00:35:45,126 --> 00:35:47,251
For pity's sake, François.

316
00:35:48,667 --> 00:35:51,459
Don't be frightened. Let me.

317
00:35:53,209 --> 00:35:55,126
- You swore.
- Yes.

318
00:36:09,126 --> 00:36:10,542
One second.

319
00:36:24,292 --> 00:36:26,709
It's better like this, isn't it?

320
00:36:28,917 --> 00:36:30,292
- No.
- What?

321
00:36:30,459 --> 00:36:32,959
Let go of me or I'll scream!

322
00:36:33,126 --> 00:36:35,584
Help!

323
00:37:10,917 --> 00:37:11,959
Excuse me.

324
00:37:13,126 --> 00:37:14,959
I'll light the way for you.

325
00:37:18,167 --> 00:37:21,084
Just light a candle
and the power comes back.

326
00:37:21,251 --> 00:37:22,667
- Going downstairs?
- To the bar.

327
00:37:22,834 --> 00:37:24,542
The bar is closed.

328
00:37:25,584 --> 00:37:29,167
Come to my room.
We were just about to open some port.

329
00:37:29,584 --> 00:37:34,417
- No, that's all right.
- Yes, come in. Just for a minute. Please do.

330
00:37:42,417 --> 00:37:43,876
Do come in.

331
00:37:49,501 --> 00:37:53,917
- My dear, allow me to introduce Mr...
- François de Richemont.

332
00:37:54,876 --> 00:37:57,584
- Miss Rosenblum.
- Pleased to meet you.

333
00:37:58,251 --> 00:38:01,209
- The pleasure's mine.
- My name is Jean Bermans.

334
00:38:03,501 --> 00:38:04,959
Please, sit.

335
00:38:08,376 --> 00:38:11,792
- Are you from Paris?
- Yes. Are you?

336
00:38:11,959 --> 00:38:15,626
No, I'm a hatter from Nîmes.
Miss Rosenblum is my associate.

337
00:38:15,792 --> 00:38:16,834
Thank you.

338
00:38:17,251 --> 00:38:18,959
Are you in business, too?

339
00:38:19,126 --> 00:38:22,084
- No, I'm a student.
- Oh, what are you studying?

340
00:38:22,542 --> 00:38:25,876
- I'm graduating high school.
- Lucky young fellow.

341
00:38:26,042 --> 00:38:28,917
I have fond memories of my student days.

342
00:38:29,292 --> 00:38:33,459
If only I could have gone to college.
But in Ostend, you know...

343
00:38:33,626 --> 00:38:36,542
- Are you here alone?
- No, I'm with...

344
00:38:37,209 --> 00:38:38,584
With my mother.

345
00:38:39,501 --> 00:38:41,834
Perhaps she'd care to join us.

346
00:38:42,001 --> 00:38:45,626
I don't think so. She's not feeling well.

347
00:38:46,501 --> 00:38:47,917
One moment.

348
00:38:52,417 --> 00:38:55,209
I'm sorry, but I heard voices.
I'm looking for matches.

349
00:38:55,376 --> 00:38:57,542
Come in. Sit down for a minute.

350
00:38:57,709 --> 00:39:00,042
Yes, but I'm with four gentlemen.

351
00:39:01,292 --> 00:39:05,459
- Four gentlemen?
- We might invite them in, too.

352
00:39:05,626 --> 00:39:07,501
That would be lovely.

353
00:39:09,334 --> 00:39:11,376
Will you show me to your room?

354
00:39:11,542 --> 00:39:13,834
- Yes, but...
- Come.

355
00:39:14,001 --> 00:39:17,042
- Which door?
- That one.

356
00:39:24,334 --> 00:39:26,876
She didn't tell me the gentlemen were...

357
00:39:27,042 --> 00:39:29,376
But it's no problem. On the contrary.

358
00:39:29,542 --> 00:39:31,042
Jean Bermans.

359
00:39:31,501 --> 00:39:36,126
Gentlemen, I'd be honoured if you came
for some port in my room.

360
00:39:36,501 --> 00:39:37,501
What do you mean in your room?

361
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:41,459
- That's very kind of you, but...
- I'd be so pleased.

362
00:39:42,126 --> 00:39:44,167
It's late. We were going to bed.

363
00:39:44,334 --> 00:39:47,376
We must celebrate the chance
that brought us together.

364
00:39:47,542 --> 00:39:51,042
- Celebrate what?
- Chance. Come along.

365
00:39:51,209 --> 00:39:53,001
Come along, please.

366
00:39:59,042 --> 00:40:00,376
This way.

367
00:40:09,334 --> 00:40:11,417
After you, miss.

368
00:40:17,584 --> 00:40:19,084
Please go in.

369
00:40:21,042 --> 00:40:23,042
You must be Dominicans.

370
00:40:23,209 --> 00:40:25,709
- No, Carmelites.
- Oh, good.

371
00:40:33,334 --> 00:40:35,709
My dear Edith, isn't this a stroke of luck?

372
00:40:35,876 --> 00:40:37,501
This is Miss Rosenblum.

373
00:40:37,667 --> 00:40:39,209
- Pleased to meet you.
- Likewise.

374
00:40:39,376 --> 00:40:41,626
Edith, pour us some port, will you?

375
00:40:41,792 --> 00:40:44,584
- Mr de Richemont, will you give me a hand?
- Of course.

376
00:40:44,751 --> 00:40:48,251
It's a bit cramped in here, but no matter.
We love these impromptu parties.

377
00:40:48,417 --> 00:40:49,709
Thank you very much.

378
00:40:49,876 --> 00:40:54,709
We're going to have a charming time,
if you have no objections.

379
00:40:55,209 --> 00:40:56,584
Excuse me.

380
00:40:58,792 --> 00:41:02,042
Mr Bermans, haven't we met before?

381
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:03,376
I don't think so.

382
00:41:03,542 --> 00:41:05,001
You never lived in the Congo?

383
00:41:05,167 --> 00:41:07,042
- In the Congo?
- The Belgian Congo.

384
00:41:07,209 --> 00:41:10,209
- I've never been to Africa. Why?
- No reason.

385
00:41:10,917 --> 00:41:13,251
- The weather's improving.
- Good.

386
00:41:13,417 --> 00:41:15,542
Personally, I love Africa.

387
00:41:29,126 --> 00:41:31,376
Saint Christopher was never any help to me.

388
00:41:31,542 --> 00:41:33,876
- Naturally, madam.
- Why's that?

389
00:41:34,376 --> 00:41:37,709
He's no longer a saint.
Nor are Saint George and some others.

390
00:41:37,876 --> 00:41:41,417
The church has become very strict
about sainthood.

391
00:41:42,292 --> 00:41:47,459
- But isn't that damaging to the faith?
- On the contrary. It reinforces it.

392
00:41:47,626 --> 00:41:50,292
Sainthood isn't like some badge.

393
00:42:05,667 --> 00:42:08,792
You've no doubt heard of Savonarola?

394
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:12,959
- Wasn't he a Dominican?
- Indeed, and an illustrious one.

395
00:42:13,126 --> 00:42:16,542
Savonarola was tried
and condemned as a heretic.

396
00:42:16,709 --> 00:42:19,251
He's completely rehabilitated now.

397
00:42:19,751 --> 00:42:22,417
Soon he may even be sanctified.

398
00:42:22,584 --> 00:42:24,876
While other saints will disappear?

399
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:27,834
Yes, it appears
that Saint Thérèse de Lisieux...

400
00:42:28,001 --> 00:42:29,459
Saint Thérèse?

401
00:42:29,834 --> 00:42:34,209
- How could they?
- That's the rumour going around Rome.

402
00:42:44,126 --> 00:42:48,376
We now know that Thérèse's parents
had a hereditary disease

403
00:42:48,542 --> 00:42:52,334
when she and her many brothers and sisters
were conceived.

404
00:42:53,334 --> 00:42:58,334
- What will become of the basilica?
- A church like all the others.

405
00:42:58,834 --> 00:43:01,001
What about the Virgin of Lourdes?
Same thing?

406
00:43:01,167 --> 00:43:05,459
No. There never was a real miracle
at Lisieux, whereas in Lourdes...

407
00:43:05,626 --> 00:43:07,917
Go on, beat me, you old slut!

408
00:43:08,084 --> 00:43:11,001
Harder! Again! That's it!

409
00:43:11,167 --> 00:43:13,126
Harder! Yes!

410
00:43:13,292 --> 00:43:16,334
I'm swine! I'm garbage!

411
00:43:16,501 --> 00:43:20,334
Beat me, you filthy trollop! Beat me!

412
00:43:21,459 --> 00:43:22,792
I'm rotten!

413
00:43:23,792 --> 00:43:25,126
A leper!

414
00:43:25,459 --> 00:43:28,334
Again! No, wait! Don't go!

415
00:43:28,751 --> 00:43:31,042
Let the monks stay, at least!

416
00:43:31,376 --> 00:43:34,876
Go on. Again! Yes!

417
00:43:35,334 --> 00:43:37,209
- Leave him to me, madam.
- Yes, take him.

418
00:43:37,376 --> 00:43:39,834
Thank you for your hospitality.

419
00:43:41,626 --> 00:43:44,209
He likes getting hit, I'll hit him.

420
00:43:44,376 --> 00:43:47,209
Calm down, Father. Calm down.

421
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:49,626
You must rest.

422
00:43:49,792 --> 00:43:51,792
This way.

423
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:30,709
Come.

424
00:44:32,251 --> 00:44:33,292
Come.

425
00:44:41,959 --> 00:44:44,042
Do whatever you want.

426
00:45:49,959 --> 00:45:51,459
Good morning. You're the first one up.

427
00:45:51,626 --> 00:45:55,417
- Good morning. Is the phone working?
- Not yet. But the road to Argenton is open.

428
00:45:55,584 --> 00:45:57,876
- Is my bill ready?
- Of course.

429
00:46:04,001 --> 00:46:06,709
- Excuse me. Are you going to Argenton?
- Yes.

430
00:46:07,042 --> 00:46:10,126
Can you give me a lift?
The bus isn't due for two hours.

431
00:46:10,292 --> 00:46:12,584
- I'd be glad to.
- Thank you.

432
00:46:13,667 --> 00:46:15,167
Here you are.

433
00:46:22,084 --> 00:46:23,959
Thank you. Do you need the bill?

434
00:46:28,001 --> 00:46:29,334
Allow me.

435
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:32,209
Goodbye.

436
00:46:52,126 --> 00:46:54,917
- I'll tell you where to drop me off.
- Of course.

437
00:46:55,084 --> 00:46:56,667
Thank you very much.

438
00:48:21,959 --> 00:48:23,167
Here he comes.

439
00:48:23,334 --> 00:48:26,501
Look out, he's coming. Take your seats.

440
00:48:41,834 --> 00:48:43,084
Attention!

441
00:48:45,167 --> 00:48:46,542
Be seated.

442
00:48:54,292 --> 00:48:57,667
THE COLONEL IS A CUCKOLD
THE CAPTAIN IS A PANSY

443
00:49:08,417 --> 00:49:10,001
Who wrote that?

444
00:49:11,792 --> 00:49:13,876
Who wrote that?

445
00:49:15,917 --> 00:49:17,626
You won't answer?

446
00:49:19,334 --> 00:49:21,501
Then I'll have to report it.

447
00:49:22,001 --> 00:49:24,042
It's incredible. Honestly.

448
00:49:24,209 --> 00:49:27,251
At your age, you still act like children.

449
00:49:27,709 --> 00:49:30,459
Duval, erase that.
And close the door, please.

450
00:49:36,876 --> 00:49:39,626
Last class, we were discussing,

451
00:49:40,167 --> 00:49:44,959
the notion of laws and misdemeanours.

452
00:49:47,584 --> 00:49:53,792
We saw how the aim of laws
is to maintain social order.

453
00:49:54,751 --> 00:49:57,376
Naturally, they're subject to change

454
00:49:57,917 --> 00:50:01,292
from one country to another,
from one age to another.

455
00:50:01,459 --> 00:50:05,126
In fact, they are merely conventions.

456
00:50:06,542 --> 00:50:09,959
The same goes for customs and morals.

457
00:50:10,542 --> 00:50:13,751
Take polygamy, for example.

458
00:50:13,917 --> 00:50:16,959
Target practice! Group 3!

459
00:50:32,959 --> 00:50:38,167
As I was saying,
morals are subject to change,

460
00:50:38,626 --> 00:50:40,001
like laws.

461
00:50:41,167 --> 00:50:44,334
So, polygamy,

462
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:48,501
which is the norm in some societies,

463
00:50:49,334 --> 00:50:51,042
is taboo in ours.

464
00:50:51,834 --> 00:50:56,709
On this subject,
I refer you to the works of Margaret Mead.

465
00:50:57,251 --> 00:51:03,042
Take it down. I repeat, Mead, M-E-A-D,

466
00:51:03,709 --> 00:51:06,334
on sexual practices in Melanesia.

467
00:51:07,376 --> 00:51:08,876
These books...

468
00:51:16,834 --> 00:51:19,626
I'm not starting over for latecomers.

469
00:51:21,084 --> 00:51:24,126
I was talking about the works
of Margaret Mead

470
00:51:24,292 --> 00:51:27,209
on sexual practices in Melanesia.

471
00:51:27,959 --> 00:51:30,042
I was saying that these works...

472
00:51:30,209 --> 00:51:32,376
Accident on Highway 787.

473
00:51:45,042 --> 00:51:48,542
With all these comings and goings,
I lost the thread.

474
00:51:49,584 --> 00:51:55,001
Right, I was saying that these works,
which are in the barracks library,

475
00:51:55,167 --> 00:51:59,709
will help you better understand
the relativity of customs

476
00:51:59,876 --> 00:52:02,042
and, consequently, of laws.

477
00:52:04,126 --> 00:52:08,584
When you compare one culture to another,

478
00:52:08,751 --> 00:52:11,042
it's all a question of viewpoint.

479
00:52:11,209 --> 00:52:13,876
Everyone is always
someone else's barbarian.

480
00:52:14,042 --> 00:52:15,501
What's more,

481
00:52:16,042 --> 00:52:17,917
as far as the relativity

482
00:52:18,917 --> 00:52:21,459
of customs and laws is concerned...

483
00:52:22,167 --> 00:52:25,709
The gasworks just blew up. General alert!

484
00:52:46,876 --> 00:52:48,459
Aren't you going with the others?

485
00:52:48,626 --> 00:52:51,417
- We're on arctal ructive duty.
- On what?

486
00:52:52,084 --> 00:52:53,917
Arctal ructive duty.

487
00:52:55,626 --> 00:52:57,126
I see. And you?

488
00:52:57,292 --> 00:53:00,001
- Me, too.
- Very well.

489
00:53:06,376 --> 00:53:08,751
With all these interruptions,

490
00:53:09,292 --> 00:53:11,042
I've forgotten what I was saying.

491
00:53:17,001 --> 00:53:18,459
Oh, yes.

492
00:53:20,667 --> 00:53:23,542
I think that everything
I just explained to you

493
00:53:24,251 --> 00:53:27,376
will help you better understand the relativity

494
00:53:28,126 --> 00:53:30,042
of customs and laws.

495
00:53:30,584 --> 00:53:34,834
You're well aware that it's often
a question of changing the laws.

496
00:53:40,959 --> 00:53:43,959
We also hear a lot about an evolution

497
00:53:44,667 --> 00:53:48,792
that is leading to changes in customs
and morals.

498
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:16,334
Hey, look at this.

499
00:54:23,459 --> 00:54:25,459
RED
WORKERS SOUND THE ALARM!

500
00:54:27,209 --> 00:54:28,584
Attention!

501
00:54:35,209 --> 00:54:36,917
- Colonel.
- Go ahead.

502
00:54:37,084 --> 00:54:38,126
Excuse me.

503
00:54:41,417 --> 00:54:45,292
I was told the class was a bit restless today.
We'll see about that.

504
00:54:46,459 --> 00:54:47,709
Sit down.

505
00:54:56,084 --> 00:54:57,417
Please, carry on.

506
00:55:01,626 --> 00:55:05,209
There's a good deal of talk
about changing our morals.

507
00:55:05,876 --> 00:55:09,334
Some people are even calling
for a general upheaval.

508
00:55:10,709 --> 00:55:16,584
But the consequences of such a disturbance
could prove unacceptable,

509
00:55:16,751 --> 00:55:18,417
even horrifying.

510
00:55:19,084 --> 00:55:21,959
I'll pick an example at random.

511
00:55:22,126 --> 00:55:24,834
My wife and I are invited over
to some friends...

512
00:55:42,626 --> 00:55:46,584
- We thought you'd never make it.
- You can't imagine the traffic.

513
00:55:46,751 --> 00:55:48,584
We nearly began without you.

514
00:55:48,751 --> 00:55:50,959
- You should have.
- Don't be silly.

515
00:55:51,126 --> 00:55:52,626
Why, here's Sophie!

516
00:55:52,792 --> 00:55:54,876
Hello, my dear, how are you?

517
00:55:55,042 --> 00:55:56,917
How you've grown.

518
00:55:57,084 --> 00:55:59,084
- Everything fine at school?
- Yes.

519
00:56:01,334 --> 00:56:03,084
You know Mrs Calmette.

520
00:56:03,251 --> 00:56:04,667
- Good day, madam.
- Good day.

521
00:56:04,834 --> 00:56:06,542
- Hello, nice to meet you.
- Hello.

522
00:56:06,709 --> 00:56:09,376
If you'll just follow me... This way.

523
00:56:12,251 --> 00:56:17,167
Let's see. Mrs Calmette, you sit there.

524
00:56:18,001 --> 00:56:19,709
Elizabeth, here.

525
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:22,042
You, Professor, on my right.

526
00:56:22,209 --> 00:56:24,834
Charles, between Elizabeth
and Mrs Calmette.

527
00:56:25,001 --> 00:56:27,667
And you, Sophie darling, come here.

528
00:56:27,834 --> 00:56:29,292
Here on my left.

529
00:56:29,459 --> 00:56:30,917
Do sit down.

530
00:56:40,126 --> 00:56:43,292
We went to see <i>Tristan and Isolde</i>
at the opera the other day.

531
00:56:43,459 --> 00:56:45,209
- Was it good?
- Splendid.

532
00:56:45,376 --> 00:56:49,542
Carlotta Igellicci was heartrending.
What a voice! What presence!

533
00:56:50,542 --> 00:56:53,042
It's a shame she's put on weight.

534
00:56:53,917 --> 00:56:56,501
Care for a cigarette?

535
00:56:56,667 --> 00:56:58,167
I'd love one, thanks.

536
00:56:59,376 --> 00:57:02,792
- How was your trip to Spain?
- Interesting.

537
00:57:02,959 --> 00:57:04,376
- But...
- But what?

538
00:57:04,834 --> 00:57:09,251
We had to come home early.
Madrid was filled with the stench of,

539
00:57:09,792 --> 00:57:11,167
pardon my language,

540
00:57:11,334 --> 00:57:12,501
food.

541
00:57:13,376 --> 00:57:15,667
It was indecent.

542
00:57:15,834 --> 00:57:20,751
What will our planet be like in 20 years
with the current population explosion?

543
00:57:21,417 --> 00:57:23,292
It makes you think.

544
00:57:23,459 --> 00:57:25,584
What are you referring to?

545
00:57:26,209 --> 00:57:30,209
Consider the quantity of toxic products
we dump into our rivers.

546
00:57:30,376 --> 00:57:32,709
Insecticides, detergents,

547
00:57:32,876 --> 00:57:34,751
all the industrial residue.

548
00:57:36,084 --> 00:57:39,084
- Not to mention bodily wastes.
- Of course.

549
00:57:39,751 --> 00:57:43,501
There are almost four billion people
on Earth.

550
00:57:43,917 --> 00:57:46,292
In 20 years, there'll be seven billion of us.

551
00:57:46,459 --> 00:57:47,876
Seven billion!

552
00:57:48,042 --> 00:57:52,584
Yes, and how much bodily waste
do you think a person discharges daily?

553
00:57:55,001 --> 00:57:58,376
I don't know. Half a pound, maybe?

554
00:57:58,542 --> 00:57:59,917
Much more.

555
00:58:00,084 --> 00:58:02,542
Urine is heavier than water.

556
00:58:02,709 --> 00:58:05,584
All told, I'd say at least three pounds.

557
00:58:05,917 --> 00:58:10,167
Multiplied by four billion, that makes
more than 12 billion pounds a day.

558
00:58:10,334 --> 00:58:13,459
In 20 years, more than 22 billion pounds.

559
00:58:13,626 --> 00:58:16,251
- Ten million tons of excrement a day?
- Exactly.

560
00:58:16,417 --> 00:58:17,709
My word.

561
00:58:18,501 --> 00:58:20,501
That's really alarming.

562
00:58:22,126 --> 00:58:23,126
Yes?

563
00:58:23,292 --> 00:58:25,209
How many tons did you say?

564
00:58:25,376 --> 00:58:27,584
More than 10 million tons a day.

565
00:58:29,334 --> 00:58:31,876
And such waste is extremely toxic.

566
00:58:32,042 --> 00:58:36,126
Its damaging effects are increased
by the presence of chemicals.

567
00:58:36,292 --> 00:58:42,542
Just try peeing into your fish tank every day
and you'll see what I mean.

568
00:58:44,292 --> 00:58:46,376
Mum, I'm really hungry.

569
00:58:46,834 --> 00:58:50,501
Sophie, it's bad manners to talk like that
at the table.

570
00:58:53,251 --> 00:58:55,042
Excuse me a moment.

571
00:58:58,251 --> 00:59:01,292
- Where's the dining room, please?
- Last door on the right.

572
00:59:01,459 --> 00:59:02,501
Thank you.

573
00:59:57,126 --> 00:59:59,001
- It's occupied!
- Sorry!

574
01:00:07,542 --> 01:00:11,209
- What is it?
- Colonel, we go on duty at 11:00 a.m.

575
01:00:12,917 --> 01:00:14,459
Go ahead then.

576
01:01:10,584 --> 01:01:13,126
Driver's license and registration.

577
01:01:19,334 --> 01:01:22,751
- Don't you know the speed limit?
- I was doing under 40.

578
01:01:22,917 --> 01:01:24,167
Really?

579
01:01:25,417 --> 01:01:29,376
- And the seat belt is compulsory.
- I know. I wasn't thinking.

580
01:01:39,917 --> 01:01:43,001
- Have you seen your tyres?
- No.

581
01:01:43,834 --> 01:01:48,959
You're not only endangering your own life
but that of other drivers.

582
01:01:49,126 --> 01:01:51,417
I have a doctor's appointment in Paris.

583
01:01:51,584 --> 01:01:53,376
Are you kidding me?

584
01:01:57,167 --> 01:02:00,709
Consider yourself lucky
I don't impound your car.

585
01:02:12,459 --> 01:02:17,001
- Richard, how are you feeling, old man?
- No better, no worse.

586
01:02:17,167 --> 01:02:20,584
- And your wife and little girl?
- Fine, thank you.

587
01:02:21,126 --> 01:02:24,001
You must come over for dinner
some evening.

588
01:02:24,167 --> 01:02:26,501
- We'd like that. Thank you.
- Come in.

589
01:02:35,542 --> 01:02:36,876
Sit down.

590
01:02:38,709 --> 01:02:41,084
- Did you bring the test results?
- Yes.

591
01:02:42,709 --> 01:02:44,459
Let's have a look.

592
01:02:47,251 --> 01:02:48,876
Glucose, 130, good.

593
01:02:49,042 --> 01:02:50,792
Cholesterol, fine.

594
01:02:51,292 --> 01:02:53,126
Uric acid... Urea...

595
01:02:53,584 --> 01:02:54,751
Good.

596
01:02:55,709 --> 01:02:56,751
Yes.

597
01:02:57,792 --> 01:02:58,834
Good.

598
01:03:03,001 --> 01:03:04,376
Very good.

599
01:03:05,292 --> 01:03:09,459
Your results are better than mine.
Now for the electrocardiogram.

600
01:03:15,126 --> 01:03:17,501
Well, it's normal.

601
01:03:18,709 --> 01:03:20,584
- You smoke a lot?
- A pack a day.

602
01:03:20,751 --> 01:03:22,084
Too much.

603
01:03:23,501 --> 01:03:25,292
And you lead a hectic life.

604
01:03:25,459 --> 01:03:29,792
Keep it up and in three or four years
you'll end up in a wheelchair.

605
01:03:31,251 --> 01:03:33,334
Let's look at the x-rays.

606
01:03:46,501 --> 01:03:48,792
This area here is clear, see?

607
01:03:49,334 --> 01:03:51,501
There's a small spot here.

608
01:03:51,667 --> 01:03:54,542
We could take another x-ray to be sure.

609
01:03:54,709 --> 01:03:56,667
And those white spots?

610
01:03:56,834 --> 01:03:58,626
Oh, nothing.

611
01:03:59,376 --> 01:04:02,251
Catherine met your wife the other day.

612
01:04:02,417 --> 01:04:04,709
So you're not going
to the coast this summer?

613
01:04:04,876 --> 01:04:07,959
Depends. If I'm not feeling well,
we'll stay in Paris.

614
01:04:10,959 --> 01:04:13,251
All right. Well?

615
01:04:15,334 --> 01:04:19,417
One thing. I'd like to make a small incision.

616
01:04:20,292 --> 01:04:22,167
Sheer medical curiosity.

617
01:04:22,334 --> 01:04:24,501
- Big?
- No, this long.

618
01:04:26,834 --> 01:04:29,501
- Is it an operation?
- Just to see.

619
01:04:30,876 --> 01:04:34,542
- When?
- Whenever you want. When you have time.

620
01:04:36,459 --> 01:04:38,584
Is tomorrow okay with you?

621
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:42,209
Tomorrow? Is it that urgent?

622
01:04:42,376 --> 01:04:46,042
It's always best to do these things
as soon as possible.

623
01:04:46,459 --> 01:04:49,001
- What's wrong?
- It's up to you,

624
01:04:49,167 --> 01:04:52,042
but personally, I'd like to have a look.

625
01:04:59,501 --> 01:05:03,251
Look, Pierre, I'm not a child anymore.

626
01:05:03,417 --> 01:05:06,417
If it's something serious, you can tell me.

627
01:05:06,584 --> 01:05:08,667
I like patients like you.

628
01:05:10,042 --> 01:05:11,876
You have a neoplasm.

629
01:05:15,917 --> 01:05:17,126
I see.

630
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:24,834
- What's that?
- A growth of new tissue.

631
01:05:25,417 --> 01:05:27,542
Or, if you prefer, cancer.

632
01:05:28,626 --> 01:05:30,209
What?

633
01:05:30,376 --> 01:05:32,667
You have cancer of the liver.

634
01:05:35,542 --> 01:05:37,001
Cancer, me?

635
01:05:37,334 --> 01:05:39,501
At a fairly advanced stage.

636
01:05:51,251 --> 01:05:55,126
But nowadays, you know, these things...

637
01:05:55,834 --> 01:05:57,209
Cigarette?

638
01:06:57,917 --> 01:07:00,042
What did Dr Pasolini say?

639
01:07:00,626 --> 01:07:01,834
It's nothing.

640
01:07:02,001 --> 01:07:05,042
Oh, good. That's a relief.

641
01:07:06,209 --> 01:07:08,542
I was a bit worried, you know.

642
01:07:11,084 --> 01:07:14,084
- Did he start you on a treatment?
- No, nothing.

643
01:07:15,334 --> 01:07:17,001
Isn't Aliette here?

644
01:07:17,167 --> 01:07:19,001
She's at school now.

645
01:07:25,959 --> 01:07:29,292
Hello? Yes, speaking.

646
01:07:31,001 --> 01:07:32,709
What did you say?

647
01:07:34,876 --> 01:07:36,251
When? How?

648
01:07:37,501 --> 01:07:39,251
That's impossible.

649
01:07:40,792 --> 01:07:42,626
We'll be right over.

650
01:07:43,209 --> 01:07:45,876
- What is it?
- Aliette's disappeared.

651
01:07:46,042 --> 01:07:48,292
- What?
- She's disappeared from school.

652
01:07:48,459 --> 01:07:52,167
Don't panic. There must be an explanation.
Did the nanny take her?

653
01:07:52,334 --> 01:07:55,501
Yes. She just got back.
She didn't say a thing.

654
01:08:02,959 --> 01:08:04,292
Brigitte!

655
01:08:12,209 --> 01:08:14,792
Exactly what happened?

656
01:08:14,959 --> 01:08:17,376
I don't know. We don't understand it.

657
01:08:17,542 --> 01:08:20,667
- You're sure she's disappeared?
- I don't know.

658
01:08:21,126 --> 01:08:23,084
What makes it so odd

659
01:08:23,251 --> 01:08:27,459
is that she and the others
were under constant supervision.

660
01:08:28,459 --> 01:08:30,209
And she was always there.

661
01:08:30,376 --> 01:08:32,626
Come with me. I'll show you.

662
01:08:41,417 --> 01:08:43,959
"Will we see him

663
01:08:45,834 --> 01:08:47,292
"come back?"

664
01:08:51,376 --> 01:08:53,751
This is Mr and Mrs Legendre,
Aliette's parents.

665
01:08:53,917 --> 01:08:55,751
Pleased to meet you.

666
01:08:55,917 --> 01:08:59,834
When the children came into class,
the teacher counted them.

667
01:09:01,542 --> 01:09:03,917
There were 22 of them, as usual.

668
01:09:04,709 --> 01:09:08,126
Five minutes later,
she noticed Aliette wasn't there.

669
01:09:08,876 --> 01:09:10,959
She called me right away.

670
01:09:12,542 --> 01:09:15,084
- Could she have run away?
- Impossible.

671
01:09:15,251 --> 01:09:18,292
The concierge is certain that no student left.

672
01:09:18,459 --> 01:09:21,417
It's unbelievable.
Isn't anyone in charge around here?

673
01:09:21,584 --> 01:09:22,917
Sit down.

674
01:09:26,209 --> 01:09:28,001
I counted them, too.

675
01:09:28,751 --> 01:09:31,959
- I took the enrolment list and called the roll.
- Mum.

676
01:09:32,751 --> 01:09:34,417
I've lost faith in this school.

677
01:09:34,584 --> 01:09:37,126
- Mum.
- Be quiet. What do you want?

678
01:09:37,292 --> 01:09:38,626
I'm here.

679
01:09:39,417 --> 01:09:41,917
Be quiet when the headmistress is talking.

680
01:09:42,084 --> 01:09:43,126
- Understand?
- Yes.

681
01:09:43,292 --> 01:09:45,376
Now go back to your seat. Go.

682
01:09:46,417 --> 01:09:49,209
I'll do the roll call again for you. You'll see.

683
01:09:52,792 --> 01:09:55,417
- Al Fariq, Juliette.
- Here.

684
01:09:56,167 --> 01:09:58,876
- Lantelle, Sophie.
- Here.

685
01:09:59,042 --> 01:10:01,126
- Loiron, Claire.
- Here.

686
01:10:01,709 --> 01:10:03,876
- Legendre, Aliette.
- Here.

687
01:10:07,709 --> 01:10:09,584
You see? She's there.

688
01:10:09,917 --> 01:10:13,251
- And all the others are there?
- All of them. I checked.

689
01:10:13,417 --> 01:10:17,709
- You looked everywhere?
- We searched the entire school. Nothing.

690
01:10:17,876 --> 01:10:21,251
Good Lord!
What could have happened to her?

691
01:10:21,626 --> 01:10:27,001
If you think we'll accept
your feeble explanation, you're wrong.

692
01:10:27,167 --> 01:10:30,459
- But, sir...
- We must notify the police at once.

693
01:10:36,084 --> 01:10:37,834
- Where's your coat?
- In the hall.

694
01:10:38,001 --> 01:10:39,042
Come on.

695
01:10:59,084 --> 01:11:00,584
- Show them in.
- Yes.

696
01:11:06,626 --> 01:11:08,209
Please come in.

697
01:11:10,876 --> 01:11:12,334
Do sit down.

698
01:11:16,959 --> 01:11:21,126
- You are Mr Legendre?
- Yes. Thanks for seeing us so quickly.

699
01:11:21,292 --> 01:11:23,834
Not at all. What can I do for you?

700
01:11:24,501 --> 01:11:27,542
- Our daughter has disappeared.
- When?

701
01:11:27,709 --> 01:11:30,626
About an hour ago, when she got to school.

702
01:11:31,167 --> 01:11:32,709
The nanny took her as usual.

703
01:11:32,876 --> 01:11:36,251
When the teacher called the roll,
she was there.

704
01:11:36,417 --> 01:11:40,584
They searched the entire school,
but obviously they didn't find her.

705
01:11:40,751 --> 01:11:44,417
Do you have any enemies?
Anyone who would wish you harm?

706
01:11:45,209 --> 01:11:46,917
I don't think so.

707
01:11:47,667 --> 01:11:49,834
You're a man who's fairly...

708
01:11:50,917 --> 01:11:56,126
I mean, if it's a kidnapping,
do you have the means to pay a ransom?

709
01:11:56,292 --> 01:11:58,542
Yes, of course.

710
01:11:58,709 --> 01:12:00,834
I see. Is there a witness?

711
01:12:01,334 --> 01:12:02,584
The nanny.

712
01:12:02,751 --> 01:12:05,084
You took this child to school?

713
01:12:05,709 --> 01:12:11,209
Yes, sir. But I don't know a thing.
It wasn't me.

714
01:12:11,376 --> 01:12:15,959
I left her at the gate, like I always do.
Didn't I, Aliette?

715
01:12:16,126 --> 01:12:20,584
That's right. It was like every day.
She left me at the gate.

716
01:12:21,167 --> 01:12:23,792
You'll speak when you're questioned.

717
01:12:25,834 --> 01:12:28,834
First, we'll fill out a missing persons form.

718
01:12:30,292 --> 01:12:34,792
You did well to bring her. It helps.
Come here, child.

719
01:12:40,334 --> 01:12:41,751
Now, then, we were saying...

720
01:12:43,251 --> 01:12:46,084
- Legendre. What is your first name?
- Aliette.

721
01:12:47,959 --> 01:12:50,459
Race, white.

722
01:12:52,126 --> 01:12:54,126
- Age?
- Eight and a half.

723
01:12:55,709 --> 01:12:58,084
Marital status, single.

724
01:13:00,167 --> 01:13:01,959
Brown eyes.

725
01:13:03,209 --> 01:13:05,417
Brown hair.

726
01:13:06,001 --> 01:13:07,251
Height?

727
01:13:08,792 --> 01:13:10,251
3'8".

728
01:13:10,417 --> 01:13:11,667
Weight?

729
01:13:12,667 --> 01:13:14,459
Fifty-five pounds.

730
01:13:14,626 --> 01:13:17,334
Wearing a blue coat,
black shoes, white socks.

731
01:13:17,501 --> 01:13:19,751
Ask the sergeant to come in, please.

732
01:13:22,417 --> 01:13:23,876
Sergeant, please.

733
01:13:30,042 --> 01:13:33,417
Issue an all-points bulletin for Paris.
We must find this child.

734
01:13:33,584 --> 01:13:34,917
Yes, sir.

735
01:13:35,667 --> 01:13:37,667
- This her?
- Yes, why?

736
01:13:38,167 --> 01:13:40,209
- Can't we take her along?
- No need.

737
01:13:40,376 --> 01:13:43,167
Just take a good look at her,
then get to work.

738
01:13:43,334 --> 01:13:44,376
Yes, sir.

739
01:13:53,334 --> 01:13:56,792
Sergeant, your shoes are far from spotless.

740
01:13:58,251 --> 01:14:00,251
You're right. I didn't have time to...

741
01:14:00,417 --> 01:14:01,709
Fine, fine, go.

742
01:14:02,792 --> 01:14:06,751
So there's no need to worry.
Everything is taken care of.

743
01:14:07,167 --> 01:14:11,209
Contact us if you hear anything,
even if you're warned against it.

744
01:14:11,376 --> 01:14:13,251
- I assure you, we will.
- Thank you, Inspector.

745
01:14:13,417 --> 01:14:15,042
Don't mention it.

746
01:14:43,167 --> 01:14:44,251
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

747
01:14:44,417 --> 01:14:45,459
Goodbye.

748
01:14:48,292 --> 01:14:49,959
- Sir.
- Good day.

749
01:14:51,167 --> 01:14:53,334
- A fine-looking dog you have.
- Yes.

750
01:14:53,792 --> 01:14:58,292
- You keep him tied up all day?
- I let him out from time to time.

751
01:14:58,459 --> 01:15:01,667
- With all this traffic?
- He's used to it.

752
01:15:03,292 --> 01:15:05,334
- What's his name?
- Chico.

753
01:15:06,001 --> 01:15:08,292
Chico. Good boy!

754
01:15:09,251 --> 01:15:12,709
The bastards who mistreat animals
should be drowned.

755
01:15:12,876 --> 01:15:13,876
That's right.

756
01:15:14,042 --> 01:15:17,126
That's what the Gospel says.
Well, more or less.

757
01:17:12,584 --> 01:17:14,334
What's the matter?

758
01:19:19,334 --> 01:19:20,792
There he is!

759
01:19:22,376 --> 01:19:24,834
I see him. It's him.

760
01:19:25,417 --> 01:19:28,584
The open window on the top floor.
I'll call in.

761
01:20:48,084 --> 01:20:49,917
Court is in session.

762
01:21:07,834 --> 01:21:09,792
The defendant will rise.

763
01:21:09,959 --> 01:21:11,834
All right, all right.

764
01:21:15,126 --> 01:21:20,167
Here are the judgments on the charges
and the verdict.

765
01:21:22,001 --> 01:21:26,334
On the charge of first-degree murder

766
01:21:26,501 --> 01:21:28,501
the jury replied guilty,

767
01:21:28,667 --> 01:21:31,417
by a majority of at least eight votes.

768
01:21:33,584 --> 01:21:37,084
As to extenuating circumstances,
the jury did not find any,

769
01:21:37,667 --> 01:21:40,417
by a majority of at least eight votes.

770
01:21:42,334 --> 01:21:46,959
Under Articles 295, 298, 297, 302 and 304,

771
01:21:47,126 --> 01:21:50,376
and Article 12 of the Penal Code, the court,

772
01:21:50,542 --> 01:21:53,001
having deliberated
in accordance with the law,

773
01:21:53,167 --> 01:21:55,542
sentences Bernard Levasseur

774
01:21:56,334 --> 01:21:57,459
to death.

775
01:22:00,959 --> 01:22:02,751
Court is adjourned.

776
01:23:07,959 --> 01:23:10,584
May I have your autograph?

777
01:23:14,917 --> 01:23:16,876
- Me, too.
- Me, too, please.

778
01:23:19,626 --> 01:23:23,584
<i>The trial of the Killer Poet lasted 14 months.</i>

779
01:23:24,167 --> 01:23:27,626
<i>Meanwhile. the search
for the little girl continued.</i>

780
01:23:28,417 --> 01:23:30,084
<i>Until one day...</i>

781
01:23:36,959 --> 01:23:39,167
Commissioner, Mr Legendre is here.

782
01:23:39,334 --> 01:23:40,792
Show him in.

783
01:23:43,417 --> 01:23:44,459
Sir.

784
01:23:46,792 --> 01:23:49,042
- Commissioner.
- Have a seat.

785
01:23:54,542 --> 01:23:57,667
After all this time,
you may have started losing hope.

786
01:23:57,834 --> 01:24:00,042
I have good news for you at last.

787
01:24:00,209 --> 01:24:02,751
- You did it? I don't believe it.
- Yes.

788
01:24:03,542 --> 01:24:05,042
Bring her in.

789
01:24:14,709 --> 01:24:16,376
Please sit, madam.

790
01:24:17,959 --> 01:24:20,501
Excuse me. Where were you?
I waited until 11:00.

791
01:24:20,667 --> 01:24:22,001
It couldn't be helped.

792
01:24:22,167 --> 01:24:24,834
- You could've phoned.
- I didn't know where you were.

793
01:24:25,001 --> 01:24:28,042
Commissioner, I don't know
how to thank you.

794
01:24:28,209 --> 01:24:29,792
Was she well treated?

795
01:24:29,959 --> 01:24:31,959
She had everything she needed, didn't she?

796
01:24:32,126 --> 01:24:34,709
Everything. As usual. You know it.

797
01:24:35,084 --> 01:24:37,042
How did you find her?

798
01:24:37,209 --> 01:24:40,167
I have the written statement. I'll read it.

799
01:24:40,709 --> 01:24:42,959
It's a rather unusual story.

800
01:24:43,292 --> 01:24:46,417
"On the night of February 7 or 8,
the population of Lisieux

801
01:24:46,584 --> 01:24:49,334
"was awakened by a deafening explosion.

802
01:24:51,584 --> 01:24:55,126
"When rescue workers arrived,
they were amazed to find..."

803
01:24:55,292 --> 01:24:56,334
What is it?

804
01:24:58,334 --> 01:24:59,709
It's already 1:30?

805
01:25:00,417 --> 01:25:02,334
I'm sorry. I have an urgent appointment.

806
01:25:02,501 --> 01:25:03,751
Go ahead.

807
01:25:03,917 --> 01:25:07,709
My secretary will read it to you.
Do you mind, Jacqueline?

808
01:25:08,209 --> 01:25:10,209
Goodbye and excuse me.

809
01:25:12,251 --> 01:25:14,084
"Written statement.

810
01:25:14,251 --> 01:25:15,959
"On the night of February 7 or 8,

811
01:25:16,126 --> 01:25:20,251
"the population of Lisieux was awakened

812
01:25:20,876 --> 01:25:24,334
"When rescue workers arrived,
they were amazed to find..."

813
01:25:31,792 --> 01:25:33,667
Shall I wait, sir?

814
01:25:33,834 --> 01:25:36,251
No, you may go. Thank you.

815
01:25:54,001 --> 01:25:55,834
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Good afternoon, Georges.

816
01:25:56,001 --> 01:25:59,126
What? They're not here yet?

817
01:25:59,292 --> 01:26:00,667
No, sir.

818
01:26:00,834 --> 01:26:06,667
But the appointment was for 1:30.
Listen, turn off that music, will you?

819
01:26:06,834 --> 01:26:11,001
You can't go into a bar or restaurant
without hearing canned music.

820
01:26:11,167 --> 01:26:13,751
- Turn it off, will you?
- Yes, sir.

821
01:26:22,542 --> 01:26:24,417
The usual?

822
01:26:24,792 --> 01:26:26,167
Of course.

823
01:26:44,834 --> 01:26:46,209
- Good afternoon, madam.
- Good afternoon.

824
01:26:46,376 --> 01:26:49,001
- Will you sit at the bar?
- No, I'll sit over there.

825
01:26:49,167 --> 01:26:50,126
Fine.

826
01:26:50,292 --> 01:26:52,417
- I'll have some port.
- Yes, madam.

827
01:27:20,584 --> 01:27:23,459
I'm sorry to disturb you, but...

828
01:27:24,751 --> 01:27:28,917
Don't be afraid.
I'm the police commissioner.

829
01:27:29,084 --> 01:27:30,334
Pleased to meet you.

830
01:27:30,501 --> 01:27:34,751
- Do you mind if I sit with you for a minute?
- Please do.

831
01:27:37,542 --> 01:27:39,251
- Your port, madam.
- Thank you.

832
01:27:39,834 --> 01:27:43,167
- Your drink is at your table, sir.
- Thank you. Leave it there.

833
01:27:45,084 --> 01:27:48,167
- You come here often?
- This is my first time.

834
01:27:48,334 --> 01:27:51,167
I was troubled when I saw you come in.

835
01:27:51,334 --> 01:27:53,876
- Shall I tell you why?
- If you wish.

836
01:27:54,667 --> 01:27:58,167
Today is the fourth anniversary
of my sister's death.

837
01:27:58,667 --> 01:28:00,542
I loved her very much.

838
01:28:01,501 --> 01:28:04,959
She looked exactly like you.
I thought you were her.

839
01:28:05,459 --> 01:28:09,792
Same face, same voice, same walk.
Her name was Marguerite.

840
01:28:10,959 --> 01:28:12,751
My name is Estelle.

841
01:28:14,292 --> 01:28:18,334
One summer afternoon
it was unbearably hot.

842
01:28:52,459 --> 01:28:53,876
- You still here?
- Yes.

843
01:28:54,042 --> 01:28:57,251
- Didn't you have an appointment at 3:00?
- It's too hot. I didn't want to go.

844
01:28:57,417 --> 01:29:00,751
Too hot! I've told you before,
you'll never amount to anything!

845
01:29:55,959 --> 01:30:00,501
I don't think I'll go to Toulouse.
I'm going to tell Mother.

846
01:30:00,667 --> 01:30:02,917
She'll be furious, but you're right.

847
01:30:03,084 --> 01:30:05,959
The family dinners, the aunts and cousins...

848
01:30:06,126 --> 01:30:07,584
So boring.

849
01:30:08,167 --> 01:30:09,584
I know.

850
01:30:09,751 --> 01:30:12,501
What would I do in Toulouse at 3:00 p.m?

851
01:30:13,251 --> 01:30:14,667
Take a nap.

852
01:30:18,084 --> 01:30:20,959
Do me a favour. Play Brahms' Rhapsody.

853
01:30:21,417 --> 01:30:22,876
If you like.

854
01:30:55,667 --> 01:30:58,126
She never did go to Toulouse.

855
01:30:58,876 --> 01:31:01,001
She died a few days later.

856
01:31:02,626 --> 01:31:05,876
- Do you play piano, too?
- Yes, a little.

857
01:31:06,042 --> 01:31:09,126
- You're not French?
- I was born in Italy.

858
01:31:09,834 --> 01:31:11,959
- Cigarette?
- No, thank you.

859
01:31:12,126 --> 01:31:13,334
May I?

860
01:31:14,042 --> 01:31:16,376
What did your sister die of?

861
01:31:16,542 --> 01:31:18,334
Miserere colic.

862
01:31:18,751 --> 01:31:20,376
What is that?

863
01:31:20,542 --> 01:31:23,417
It's horrible, especially in the final stages.

864
01:31:23,584 --> 01:31:26,001
You end up vomiting...

865
01:31:26,876 --> 01:31:28,709
- Excuse me.
- How awful.

866
01:31:28,876 --> 01:31:30,209
Horrible.

867
01:31:32,626 --> 01:31:34,334
I must be going,

868
01:31:34,501 --> 01:31:36,876
but it was extraordinary
meeting you like this.

869
01:31:37,042 --> 01:31:41,292
I'd like to see you again,
invite you to the Policemen's Ball.

870
01:31:41,459 --> 01:31:43,417
I'd love to go.

871
01:31:43,584 --> 01:31:45,417
A call for you, sir.

872
01:31:45,959 --> 01:31:49,126
- Is it Marcel saying he's late?
- I don't think so.

873
01:31:49,292 --> 01:31:51,084
No one else knows I'm here.

874
01:31:51,251 --> 01:31:53,542
Shall I say I haven't seen you?

875
01:31:53,709 --> 01:31:55,709
No. Ask who's calling.

876
01:31:58,292 --> 01:32:00,584
Never a moment's peace.

877
01:32:00,751 --> 01:32:03,917
Would you mind giving me
your name and address?

878
01:32:05,417 --> 01:32:07,876
It's your sister, Marguerite, sir.

879
01:32:09,334 --> 01:32:12,084
- What?
- She says she must speak to you.

880
01:32:13,126 --> 01:32:15,626
Georges, tell her to go screw herself.

881
01:32:15,792 --> 01:32:18,042
Excuse me, madam.

882
01:32:18,501 --> 01:32:22,584
This must be a sick joke.
My sister's been dead for four years.

883
01:32:23,459 --> 01:32:24,959
But, sir...

884
01:32:25,542 --> 01:32:27,042
She insists.

885
01:32:27,209 --> 01:32:29,251
She wants to see you tonight
in the family vault.

886
01:32:29,417 --> 01:32:32,751
She says the key
is in your right-hand desk drawer.

887
01:32:33,292 --> 01:32:35,001
Why, that's true.

888
01:32:35,542 --> 01:32:40,501
Ask her what I requested she play
one hot summer day

889
01:32:41,209 --> 01:32:43,626
when I went in her room.

890
01:32:43,792 --> 01:32:48,376
The commissioner wants to know what
he asked you to play one hot summer day

891
01:32:48,542 --> 01:32:50,667
when he went in your room.

892
01:32:53,792 --> 01:32:56,209
Brahms' Rhapsody, sir.

893
01:33:04,459 --> 01:33:05,959
Give me that.

894
01:33:06,709 --> 01:33:08,292
Hello.

895
01:33:08,751 --> 01:33:11,001
Yes, speaking. Who are you?

896
01:33:13,417 --> 01:33:17,042
Learn the true mystery
of death tonight? But...

897
01:33:18,667 --> 01:33:20,917
Hello? Hello?

898
01:33:48,292 --> 01:33:51,084
- What do you want?
- I want to come in.

899
01:33:51,251 --> 01:33:52,251
It's closed at this hour.

900
01:33:52,417 --> 01:33:55,917
I'm Mr Richepin.
My family vault is here. Let me in.

901
01:33:56,417 --> 01:33:58,709
You need a special authorisation.

902
01:33:59,917 --> 01:34:02,167
I'm the police commissioner.

903
01:34:08,292 --> 01:34:10,417
Go in, then. Shall I go with you?

904
01:34:10,584 --> 01:34:12,376
No need. Stay here.

905
01:34:23,834 --> 01:34:24,876
Hello.

906
01:35:55,792 --> 01:35:57,209
That's him!

907
01:36:00,209 --> 01:36:02,834
- What are you doing? Let go!
- Take him away!

908
01:36:03,001 --> 01:36:05,042
Don't you know who I am?

909
01:36:06,417 --> 01:36:08,751
Hands off! I'm the police commissioner!

910
01:36:08,917 --> 01:36:11,917
- Explain it at the station.
- Let go, I said.

911
01:36:12,584 --> 01:36:16,126
Stand at attention
and give me your badge numbers.

912
01:36:46,042 --> 01:36:47,084
Yes?

913
01:36:49,292 --> 01:36:51,959
- The commissioner.
- Send him in.

914
01:37:07,376 --> 01:37:08,709
Sit down.

915
01:37:11,542 --> 01:37:14,792
You should know that I've been treated
in a most shameful manner.

916
01:37:15,626 --> 01:37:17,917
I couldn't even call home.

917
01:37:19,709 --> 01:37:25,417
You were found last night at the cemetery,
desecrating a crypt.

918
01:37:25,584 --> 01:37:29,709
When arrested, you claimed you were
the police commissioner.

919
01:37:30,751 --> 01:37:32,792
You know full well I am.

920
01:37:34,084 --> 01:37:37,084
I order you to return my belongings at once.

921
01:37:37,876 --> 01:37:40,709
And take me to my office.
You'll hear about this.

922
01:37:40,876 --> 01:37:42,084
Of course.

923
01:37:42,251 --> 01:37:45,834
As we were saying, desecration of a crypt.

924
01:37:46,917 --> 01:37:49,584
- It was my sister's casket.
- Your sister?

925
01:37:50,126 --> 01:37:52,417
Yes. I went to see my sister.

926
01:37:53,626 --> 01:37:54,876
She phoned me.

927
01:37:56,376 --> 01:37:58,084
Put him back in his cell.

928
01:38:06,459 --> 01:38:09,459
Get me the police commissioner. It's urgent.

929
01:38:12,667 --> 01:38:14,542
Hello, Commissioner?

930
01:38:14,709 --> 01:38:17,876
Sorry to disturb you.
This is Inspector Dupuis.

931
01:38:18,584 --> 01:38:22,751
We've arrested a fellow
who claims to be the police commissioner.

932
01:38:23,917 --> 01:38:26,834
Claims to be the police commissioner?
How strange.

933
01:38:27,001 --> 01:38:28,876
Does he look like me?

934
01:38:29,667 --> 01:38:30,834
Is he pleasant?

935
01:38:31,001 --> 01:38:32,667
Not at all.

936
01:38:33,292 --> 01:38:34,501
I see.

937
01:38:34,917 --> 01:38:37,042
Bring him here right away.

938
01:38:57,126 --> 01:38:59,667
Superintendent,
the commissioner will see you now.

939
01:39:19,126 --> 01:39:21,084
This way, please.

940
01:39:21,501 --> 01:39:24,959
There you are. Come in. How are you?

941
01:39:25,126 --> 01:39:27,334
- Fine, and you?
- Fine, thanks.

942
01:39:28,334 --> 01:39:31,126
- That will be all, Inspector. Thank you.
- Thank you.

943
01:39:32,959 --> 01:39:34,792
Won't you have a seat over there?

944
01:39:35,126 --> 01:39:36,667
I'm fine here.

945
01:39:37,376 --> 01:39:40,626
Very well. You there, and me here.

946
01:39:45,167 --> 01:39:47,084
Two glasses of scotch.

947
01:39:47,917 --> 01:39:50,501
- You've put on weight.
- So have you.

948
01:39:51,001 --> 01:39:54,292
- All those official dinners.
- Always eating and drinking.

949
01:39:54,459 --> 01:39:56,751
- We ought to refuse.
- Not easy.

950
01:39:56,917 --> 01:39:59,334
What are you doing this morning?

951
01:39:59,501 --> 01:40:03,126
- This morning, you know...
- Ah, yes, the zoo. At noon.

952
01:40:04,084 --> 01:40:06,251
I fear that there may be some trouble,
but I've taken precautions.

953
01:40:06,417 --> 01:40:09,584
I've stationed 12 vehicles
of riot police nearby.

954
01:40:09,751 --> 01:40:13,376
But not grouped together.
Spread them out, some here, some there.

955
01:40:13,542 --> 01:40:15,584
We mustn't alarm people.

956
01:40:15,751 --> 01:40:19,501
The main thing is to keep them
from reaching the cages.

957
01:40:19,667 --> 01:40:23,001
The locks have been carefully checked.

958
01:40:23,167 --> 01:40:26,917
And anyway, if some animals are killed,
tough luck.

959
01:40:27,834 --> 01:40:30,626
The lives of our men are more valuable
than a zebra's.

960
01:40:35,001 --> 01:40:37,167
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

961
01:41:45,626 --> 01:41:48,584
<i>Down with liberty!</i>

962
01:41:49,334 --> 01:41:51,667
- Charge.
- And let them have it.
