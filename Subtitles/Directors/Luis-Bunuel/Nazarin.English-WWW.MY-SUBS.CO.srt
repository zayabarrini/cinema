<i>Nazarín</i> is part of the collections
of the Fundación Televisa A.C.

2
00:00:04,667 --> 00:00:07,546
This version is a product of the
joint project for the preservation

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:10,667
of Mexican cinema by the Cineteca
Nacional and the Fundación Televisa.

4
00:00:11,042 --> 00:00:13,094
The digitization and
restoration was carried out by

5
00:00:13,118 --> 00:00:15,171
the Cineteca Nacional
Digital Restoration Laboratory

6
00:00:15,195 --> 00:00:17,003
from a 35 mm acetate
negative for image

7
00:00:17,027 --> 00:00:19,042
and from a 35 mm interpositive
for sound.

8
00:00:20,042 --> 00:00:22,530
The acetate negative has a very prominent vertical
line at the bottom.

9
00:00:22,554 --> 00:00:25,303
To remove it, it was
necessary to replace the scene

10
00:00:25,327 --> 00:00:28,042
with frames taken from
a composite positive copy.

11
00:00:28,066 --> 00:00:29,966
A total of 135,761 frames were restored.

12
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:46,459
Hats, shoes, bottles...

13
00:00:46,459 --> 00:00:49,084
...or used clothes
you want to sell.

14
00:00:53,042 --> 00:00:59,126
Hats, shoes, bottles or used
clothes you want to sell.

15
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:10,876
Birds for sale.

16
00:01:14,709 --> 00:01:20,001
Birds for sale.

17
00:01:41,834 --> 00:01:46,626
Tamales, get your
hot tamales.

18
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:53,959
Come get your hot tamales.

19
00:02:15,084 --> 00:02:17,209
<i>Heroes Hostel</i>

20
00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:18,876
Camella is not a thief.

21
00:02:18,876 --> 00:02:21,334
Why is her mother in jail, then?

22
00:02:21,417 --> 00:02:23,126
- She took my buttons.
- Made of shells.

23
00:02:23,167 --> 00:02:24,626
You showed them to me yourself.

24
00:02:24,626 --> 00:02:25,542
Shells?

25
00:02:25,542 --> 00:02:29,167
I took them off
chácharas old coat.

26
00:02:30,334 --> 00:02:33,167
Tell it to her face,
get it off your back.

27
00:02:33,167 --> 00:02:35,084
Do you think I'm scared of her?

28
00:02:35,167 --> 00:02:36,501
If I see her I'll make her...

29
00:02:36,501 --> 00:02:39,542
...swallow them and pull
them out of her stomach.

30
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:44,334
The wires should be on the front.

31
00:02:44,334 --> 00:02:46,751
Yes, that would be more practical.

32
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,167
The blueprints of the project...

33
00:02:49,167 --> 00:02:51,417
...will be ready this week, Mr. Pablo.

34
00:02:54,126 --> 00:02:55,167
Excuse me, sir.

35
00:02:55,167 --> 00:02:57,667
Is there going to be
electricity here?

36
00:02:58,209 --> 00:02:59,334
Will they charge for it?

37
00:02:59,334 --> 00:03:01,667
They're bringing it
for free, you fool.

38
00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:05,584
I can't afford candles,
how can I buy bulbs?

39
00:03:05,584 --> 00:03:07,751
Electricity is a public utility.

40
00:03:07,751 --> 00:03:09,334
There is no such thing here.

41
00:03:09,334 --> 00:03:10,709
This is a poor neighborhood.

42
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:12,126
Let's get it, it's on the table.

43
00:03:12,126 --> 00:03:13,376
First come, first serve.

44
00:03:13,376 --> 00:03:14,334
Get out.

45
00:03:14,626 --> 00:03:16,417
Nobody comes in my kitchen.

46
00:03:16,417 --> 00:03:17,876
Mrs. Chanfa.

47
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:19,626
Mrs. Chanfa.

48
00:03:19,626 --> 00:03:20,834
Come up, please.

49
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:23,501
Now what happened
to the blessed soul?

50
00:03:23,501 --> 00:03:25,292
Mrs. Chanfa!

51
00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:27,542
Stop shouting, I’m not deaf.

52
00:03:27,542 --> 00:03:29,084
I'm coming.

53
00:03:33,834 --> 00:03:35,042
You!

54
00:03:35,667 --> 00:03:37,126
You've got to do something.

55
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:38,917
You must react.

56
00:03:39,001 --> 00:03:42,459
If you don't pay me tonight,
you'll lose your house.

57
00:03:52,626 --> 00:03:54,834
Mrs. Chanfa, guess what.

58
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:56,792
Anything, coming from you.

59
00:03:57,167 --> 00:03:59,001
What disease is it this time?

60
00:03:59,001 --> 00:04:00,001
Well, look here.

61
00:04:04,084 --> 00:04:05,834
The fact is, I was robbed.

62
00:04:07,042 --> 00:04:09,167
All the clothes from the trunk.

63
00:04:10,376 --> 00:04:11,334
Look.

64
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:14,042
I have nothing to wear
but the cloak.

65
00:04:14,042 --> 00:04:16,001
And only because I had it on.

66
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:17,042
Plus...

67
00:04:17,126 --> 00:04:19,501
...the little bit of food
there was in the kitchen.

68
00:04:20,376 --> 00:04:21,626
What more did you want?

69
00:04:22,626 --> 00:04:24,584
The alms from yesterday's mass.

70
00:04:24,917 --> 00:04:28,667
I curse your moment of birth,
I am tired of you.

71
00:04:29,542 --> 00:04:32,167
What will it be, you big fool?

72
00:04:32,376 --> 00:04:33,501
A piece of bread...

73
00:04:33,501 --> 00:04:36,334
...or some tortillas
to keep me on my feet.

74
00:04:36,334 --> 00:04:38,084
The rest doesn't matter.

75
00:04:38,251 --> 00:04:40,626
If you can spare it,
may god repay you.

76
00:04:40,626 --> 00:04:42,084
What if I can't...

77
00:04:42,334 --> 00:04:44,084
...or don't want to?

78
00:04:44,501 --> 00:04:45,667
Then, I won't eat.

79
00:04:45,751 --> 00:04:48,626
It wouldn't be a first.

80
00:04:48,917 --> 00:04:51,917
Anyway, who was the wretch
who stole from you?

81
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:53,834
Chona, no doubt about it.

82
00:04:54,126 --> 00:04:56,792
She came in to clean
house and make coffee.

83
00:04:56,876 --> 00:04:59,876
I thanked her,
and when I remembered...

84
00:04:59,876 --> 00:05:00,709
...there was nothing...

85
00:05:00,709 --> 00:05:01,751
did you hear?

86
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:04,292
They called your cousin a thief.

87
00:05:04,292 --> 00:05:05,001
Who?

88
00:05:05,001 --> 00:05:07,001
The priest up there.

89
00:05:07,001 --> 00:05:09,209
People walk in
and out of his home.

90
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:10,334
Be they thieves...

91
00:05:10,334 --> 00:05:12,292
...or whatever...

92
00:05:13,667 --> 00:05:15,667
where are you going, doll?

93
00:05:19,501 --> 00:05:22,667
Even manure smells better
than that woman's perfume.

94
00:05:24,001 --> 00:05:25,292
I'd better go.

95
00:05:42,001 --> 00:05:44,959
Look who dared spread poison.

96
00:05:45,126 --> 00:05:46,667
That rotten priest.

97
00:05:46,751 --> 00:05:49,001
He said she stole from him.

98
00:05:49,126 --> 00:05:51,459
Chona may be a street
walker like us...

99
00:05:51,542 --> 00:05:53,292
...but she's better than her mother!

100
00:05:53,376 --> 00:05:55,542
What did they steal,
vinegar face?

101
00:05:55,667 --> 00:05:57,626
Not your bones, I presume.

102
00:05:57,709 --> 00:05:58,542
Look at that.

103
00:05:58,542 --> 00:05:59,834
The almighty bishop.

104
00:05:59,834 --> 00:06:02,667
Even flies refuse to
stand on his skin.

105
00:06:02,667 --> 00:06:05,334
The sacred grave of
11 thousand virgins.

106
00:06:05,334 --> 00:06:06,751
That's what chona took.

107
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:08,334
Wash your mouth out before...

108
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:10,126
...you talk to honest people.

109
00:06:10,126 --> 00:06:12,001
Out, you've said enough.

110
00:06:12,001 --> 00:06:13,417
But he insulted my cousin.

111
00:06:13,417 --> 00:06:14,917
Get out, the three of you.

112
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:16,959
Don't you dare bother the priest.

113
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,792
Don't yell,
I’m not your sister.

114
00:06:18,792 --> 00:06:20,001
Come on.

115
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:23,417
I'm leaving.

116
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:24,667
Because I feel like it...

117
00:06:24,667 --> 00:06:27,501
...you damned slave drivers.
Because we're poor.

118
00:06:27,876 --> 00:06:30,376
Stop running, they won't bite.

119
00:06:30,376 --> 00:06:31,834
Pretending to be so good.

120
00:06:31,834 --> 00:06:32,834
Damnation.

121
00:06:32,876 --> 00:06:34,126
Let's go.

122
00:06:40,209 --> 00:06:41,542
Thank you very much, sir.

123
00:06:41,626 --> 00:06:42,834
You're welcome, father.

124
00:06:43,167 --> 00:06:44,751
Should I report the theft?

125
00:06:44,751 --> 00:06:46,209
I don't have the habit.

126
00:06:46,209 --> 00:06:47,084
The habit?

127
00:06:47,167 --> 00:06:48,917
You've been robbed so many times?

128
00:06:48,917 --> 00:06:50,376
Yes sir, many.

129
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:51,334
Always.

130
00:06:51,667 --> 00:06:52,584
Excuse me.

131
00:06:53,084 --> 00:06:54,542
Sorry, father.

132
00:06:55,167 --> 00:06:57,459
May I ask you some questions?

133
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:58,959
Sure, certainly.

134
00:06:59,167 --> 00:07:00,876
Come right in...

135
00:07:00,876 --> 00:07:03,292
...make yourself at home.
There's a staircase.

136
00:07:03,292 --> 00:07:05,001
Everybody comes in and out.

137
00:07:05,001 --> 00:07:06,709
If you like, come in.

138
00:07:07,459 --> 00:07:08,709
Come in.

139
00:07:11,042 --> 00:07:13,084
We hope we're not interrupting.

140
00:07:13,084 --> 00:07:14,167
Not at all.

141
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:15,501
Make yourselves at home.

142
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:18,167
I heard you are not
troubled by the thefts.

143
00:07:18,167 --> 00:07:19,834
I don't keep anything, see?

144
00:07:19,834 --> 00:07:21,251
I don't know what keys are.

145
00:07:21,501 --> 00:07:23,126
Besides, my few possessions...

146
00:07:23,501 --> 00:07:24,959
...that I had, rather...

147
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:27,251
...aren't worth the
effort of locking up.

148
00:07:27,501 --> 00:07:28,876
But please, sit down.

149
00:07:31,834 --> 00:07:34,209
Are you an orthodox priest?

150
00:07:34,209 --> 00:07:35,126
No, sir.

151
00:07:35,126 --> 00:07:37,542
I am roman catholic and apostolic.

152
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:40,501
I profess my ideas with conviction...

153
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:42,209
...as I do my faith in Christ our lord.

154
00:07:42,417 --> 00:07:43,834
Things don't belong to anybody.

155
00:07:43,917 --> 00:07:45,667
They are for whomever need them.

156
00:07:45,667 --> 00:07:49,626
I'm surprised to see a
priest living in this hostel.

157
00:07:49,626 --> 00:07:51,084
My neighbors are poor.

158
00:07:51,084 --> 00:07:52,126
So am I.

159
00:07:52,126 --> 00:07:53,667
That's why I live among them.

160
00:07:53,667 --> 00:07:55,167
Oh, sorry, father.

161
00:07:55,167 --> 00:07:56,876
I've come to trouble you.

162
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:57,917
What do you need, woman?

163
00:07:57,917 --> 00:08:00,667
The boys broke the pot,
I came to get yours.

164
00:08:00,917 --> 00:08:02,084
- Take it.
- Thank you.

165
00:08:02,084 --> 00:08:04,292
You aren't Mexican, are you?

166
00:08:04,834 --> 00:08:06,167
My parents were Spaniards...

167
00:08:06,167 --> 00:08:07,792
...and I went to school in Spain.

168
00:08:07,792 --> 00:08:09,459
Where do you preach?

169
00:08:10,334 --> 00:08:12,834
I rarely step into the pulpit.

170
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:16,709
I speak low and familiarly
to those who want to listen.

171
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:18,042
And to whoever is close by...

172
00:08:18,042 --> 00:08:19,251
...I speak my mind.

173
00:08:19,251 --> 00:08:20,251
How do you support yourself?

174
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:21,792
From paid masses.

175
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:23,334
When there are any.

176
00:08:23,334 --> 00:08:25,334
I'm taking this wood, father.

177
00:08:25,334 --> 00:08:27,042
You're not using it, anyway.

178
00:08:27,042 --> 00:08:28,292
Fine, woman.

179
00:08:28,626 --> 00:08:32,501
No offense, but your
life seems very precarious.

180
00:08:33,001 --> 00:08:34,126
Quite so.

181
00:08:34,334 --> 00:08:36,584
But due to my conformity
I am not bitter.

182
00:08:36,584 --> 00:08:37,501
So...

183
00:08:37,501 --> 00:08:39,209
...you challenge outrage...

184
00:08:39,209 --> 00:08:40,584
...hunger, poverty...

185
00:08:40,584 --> 00:08:42,792
...persecution and slandering.

186
00:08:44,209 --> 00:08:45,459
I do not challenge them.

187
00:08:45,626 --> 00:08:46,542
I withstand them.

188
00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:48,376
From what you've said...

189
00:08:48,376 --> 00:08:51,167
...I presume you won't
improve your condition...

190
00:08:51,167 --> 00:08:53,292
...or ask your superiors for anything.

191
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:55,834
That is correct, I do not intend...

192
00:08:55,834 --> 00:08:57,209
...and I do not ask.

193
00:08:57,501 --> 00:09:01,084
You eat when you need to,
if not, you don't.

194
00:09:01,084 --> 00:09:03,042
Exactly, I do not eat.

195
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:06,584
And if it is necessary,
I ask for charity.

196
00:09:07,417 --> 00:09:10,251
Don't you think that the
dignity of a priest...

197
00:09:10,251 --> 00:09:13,334
...cannot be reduced
to asking for charity?

198
00:09:13,542 --> 00:09:14,667
Oh no, sir.

199
00:09:14,917 --> 00:09:17,042
Charity does not
degrade the recipient.

200
00:09:17,042 --> 00:09:19,001
Nor does it affect dignity.

201
00:09:19,876 --> 00:09:20,959
But, sirs...

202
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,501
...haven't we spoken
enough about me?

203
00:09:27,209 --> 00:09:31,209
If we, moved by your
sad situation were to...

204
00:09:31,209 --> 00:09:33,917
...place some coins
in your hands...

205
00:09:34,167 --> 00:09:35,709
...would you take them?

206
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:40,334
It was a pleasure, father.

207
00:09:40,501 --> 00:09:41,667
Likewise, sir.

208
00:09:41,667 --> 00:09:43,001
At your service.

209
00:09:43,001 --> 00:09:44,459
Thank you very much, sir.

210
00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:30,501
If you want to die,
use the beam.

211
00:10:30,501 --> 00:10:32,501
That won't crack.

212
00:10:33,334 --> 00:10:34,917
Stay still, mule.

213
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:37,334
Even if you really
want to die...

214
00:10:37,334 --> 00:10:39,626
...he doesn't deserve
such a favor.

215
00:10:39,792 --> 00:10:41,584
Leave me alone.

216
00:10:41,584 --> 00:10:42,917
I don't feel like it.

217
00:10:43,001 --> 00:10:44,626
Now, you listen to me.

218
00:10:44,792 --> 00:10:46,501
I don't want
stories in my house.

219
00:10:46,667 --> 00:10:48,376
If you want to be in the newspaper...

220
00:10:48,376 --> 00:10:50,792
...jump in front of a train,
the audience is bigger.

221
00:10:51,042 --> 00:10:54,459
You'd better get to work
and stop thinking...

222
00:10:54,459 --> 00:10:56,417
...things you shouldn't.

223
00:10:56,667 --> 00:10:57,917
He's back, isn't he?

224
00:10:57,917 --> 00:11:01,542
No, but he said he would
pay me what you owe.

225
00:11:03,001 --> 00:11:04,001
Come on, woman.

226
00:11:04,001 --> 00:11:07,251
Cheer up, and come
help me in the kitchen.

227
00:11:13,001 --> 00:11:15,834
Take father Nazario's
breakfast upstairs.

228
00:11:15,834 --> 00:11:17,792
He might give you good advice.

229
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:19,084
You want one?

230
00:11:19,626 --> 00:11:20,667
Eat, woman.

231
00:11:20,667 --> 00:11:24,126
Why don't you eat? That's
why you get those attacks.

232
00:11:24,126 --> 00:11:24,751
Want some?

233
00:11:25,042 --> 00:11:25,959
No.

234
00:11:26,126 --> 00:11:28,209
Don't eat, go ahead and die.

235
00:11:34,042 --> 00:11:35,001
Good morning.

236
00:11:35,001 --> 00:11:36,751
God bless you, father.

237
00:11:36,751 --> 00:11:38,292
May he repay you.

238
00:11:38,292 --> 00:11:40,084
I'm fine this time.

239
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:41,959
Wait.

240
00:11:48,042 --> 00:11:49,751
Take some of this.

241
00:11:51,251 --> 00:11:54,667
God bless you,
and may he give you more.

242
00:11:57,667 --> 00:12:00,126
Not so much, or else...

243
00:12:01,209 --> 00:12:02,709
thank you very much.

244
00:12:13,001 --> 00:12:14,667
What's wrong?

245
00:12:15,542 --> 00:12:16,834
Who are you?

246
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:18,834
Oh, I know.

247
00:12:18,917 --> 00:12:21,292
You live beneath this room.

248
00:12:29,001 --> 00:12:30,542
Why are you crying?

249
00:12:33,417 --> 00:12:35,459
You yelled in your sleep.

250
00:12:36,209 --> 00:12:37,667
Bad dreams.

251
00:12:40,251 --> 00:12:42,251
You've been deceived, right?

252
00:12:44,626 --> 00:12:46,167
Go back to your town...

253
00:12:46,334 --> 00:12:47,376
...to your people.

254
00:13:23,584 --> 00:13:25,167
Why did you return, pinto?

255
00:13:25,167 --> 00:13:27,376
Where are the clothes to wash?

256
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,459
Your burner.

257
00:13:45,501 --> 00:13:46,667
Well.

258
00:13:47,084 --> 00:13:49,334
- Will you return?
- No.

259
00:13:50,417 --> 00:13:52,334
Are you leaving forever?

260
00:13:52,751 --> 00:13:54,792
Didn't you know?

261
00:14:27,001 --> 00:14:27,959
Celery.

262
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:38,667
A mixed one for me.

263
00:14:38,667 --> 00:14:39,834
Half.

264
00:14:40,001 --> 00:14:41,584
One liter, lime.

265
00:14:41,751 --> 00:14:43,667
Have a drink, cheer up.

266
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:46,417
Come on, it's celery spirits.

267
00:14:46,417 --> 00:14:47,876
I can't hold it.

268
00:14:47,876 --> 00:14:49,626
Why do you think we drink?

269
00:14:49,626 --> 00:14:50,792
To get drunk.

270
00:14:50,917 --> 00:14:52,834
I'm glad you looked for me.

271
00:14:52,834 --> 00:14:54,834
We're from the same town.

272
00:14:54,834 --> 00:14:56,167
What you have to do now...

273
00:14:56,251 --> 00:14:57,959
...is come live with me.

274
00:14:58,126 --> 00:14:59,876
I considered being a maid.

275
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:00,792
Look...

276
00:15:00,792 --> 00:15:03,667
see who's coming in,
look at her blouse.

277
00:15:12,501 --> 00:15:14,084
Good evening.

278
00:15:14,667 --> 00:15:16,292
Greet me.

279
00:15:16,334 --> 00:15:18,584
How dare you greet me, you thief?

280
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:21,209
Where did you get those buttons?

281
00:15:22,251 --> 00:15:23,251
At a store.

282
00:15:23,251 --> 00:15:24,667
I bought them.

283
00:15:24,667 --> 00:15:27,167
My drawer is not a store.

284
00:15:27,167 --> 00:15:29,417
Come here, I’ll teach you.

285
00:15:29,417 --> 00:15:31,792
So, the sows are
feeling brave this morning.

286
00:15:31,876 --> 00:15:33,501
What am I, disabled?

287
00:15:33,501 --> 00:15:36,459
- Whore.
- Madame.

288
00:15:36,751 --> 00:15:37,917
You're going to get it...

289
00:15:37,917 --> 00:15:39,542
...you hussy.

290
00:15:39,876 --> 00:15:41,834
Up front, don't be a...

291
00:15:42,501 --> 00:15:44,667
let me go, I’m going to kill her.

292
00:15:44,667 --> 00:15:45,584
Let her go.

293
00:15:46,917 --> 00:15:47,959
You'll see.

294
00:15:48,876 --> 00:15:49,751
Let me go

295
00:15:49,751 --> 00:15:50,792
let me go.

296
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:53,917
Let me go.

297
00:15:54,584 --> 00:15:56,501
You wretch, scoundrel.

298
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:01,209
You tramp...

299
00:16:01,542 --> 00:16:02,626
leave her to me.

300
00:16:02,626 --> 00:16:05,834
Leave this one to me.

301
00:16:06,084 --> 00:16:07,126
Kill her.

302
00:16:07,126 --> 00:16:08,292
I'll kill her.

303
00:16:16,167 --> 00:16:18,126
What are you doing here?

304
00:16:18,126 --> 00:16:20,084
I can't be apart from you.

305
00:16:20,167 --> 00:16:21,126
Hussy.

306
00:16:21,334 --> 00:16:22,834
You're so pretty.

307
00:16:22,834 --> 00:16:25,167
You've taken over my thoughts.

308
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:27,751
This is how I wanted to see you.

309
00:16:27,751 --> 00:16:30,042
Begging for what I won't give.

310
00:16:30,417 --> 00:16:32,334
You always want the same thing.

311
00:16:32,334 --> 00:16:34,876
I'm going to bleed you,
and then I’ll go.

312
00:16:34,876 --> 00:16:37,667
I'll go to others who
are worth more than you.

313
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,417
You like me, don't you?

314
00:16:43,501 --> 00:16:45,292
I've robbed your will...

315
00:16:45,292 --> 00:16:48,376
you can't leave me
even if you wanted to.

316
00:16:48,501 --> 00:16:49,751
Pig.

317
00:18:15,709 --> 00:18:18,167
Good evening, Father, it's Andara.

318
00:18:18,167 --> 00:18:19,751
What do you want at this hour?

319
00:18:19,751 --> 00:18:21,751
Which Andara are you?

320
00:18:21,751 --> 00:18:24,959
The one who insulted
you this morning...

321
00:18:25,167 --> 00:18:27,001
...and said the dirtiest things.

322
00:18:27,001 --> 00:18:29,001
Oh, you're one of the three...

323
00:18:29,001 --> 00:18:30,584
exactly.

324
00:18:30,584 --> 00:18:34,209
I'm telling you that my
cousin chona is a thief.

325
00:18:34,209 --> 00:18:35,626
And you're a saint.

326
00:18:36,126 --> 00:18:37,292
Well, I’ll be.

327
00:18:37,292 --> 00:18:39,001
What are you doing here?

328
00:18:39,792 --> 00:18:41,709
They're following me.

329
00:18:45,209 --> 00:18:46,667
I have taken a life.

330
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:47,792
Heavens!

331
00:18:48,626 --> 00:18:51,001
Why did you come here to hide?

332
00:18:51,001 --> 00:18:53,626
Because they won't
find me here.

333
00:18:53,876 --> 00:18:56,542
I haven't said
I’ll let you stay.

334
00:18:57,501 --> 00:18:58,792
I'm wounded.

335
00:19:01,542 --> 00:19:03,376
Just look at you.

336
00:19:03,626 --> 00:19:05,376
You poor soul.

337
00:19:05,584 --> 00:19:08,001
How much blood have you lost?

338
00:19:09,292 --> 00:19:11,084
Let me fix that wound.

339
00:19:17,209 --> 00:19:18,417
Who did this to you?

340
00:19:19,001 --> 00:19:21,292
That damned camella...

341
00:19:21,292 --> 00:19:23,459
...with a knife she was hiding.

342
00:19:23,917 --> 00:19:26,709
Anyway, why do you
want to know?

343
00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:29,001
To tum me in?

344
00:19:29,584 --> 00:19:31,001
Tell me how it happened.

345
00:19:31,001 --> 00:19:34,001
I'll decide if I should
help you or tum you in.

346
00:19:38,251 --> 00:19:41,917
All because of some buttons
that tramp stole from me.

347
00:19:42,501 --> 00:19:45,501
When I confronted her she
reacted, and I cut her face.

348
00:19:46,001 --> 00:19:48,876
Then she called me a whore,
and I took it.

349
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:52,001
Oh, but then she called
me a drunk and a madame...

350
00:19:52,001 --> 00:19:53,417
...and I couldn't take that.

351
00:19:53,917 --> 00:19:55,834
She pulled out a knife...

352
00:19:56,001 --> 00:19:57,834
...and cut me right here.

353
00:19:57,834 --> 00:19:59,126
I took it from her...

354
00:19:59,126 --> 00:20:00,834
...and stabbed her over here.

355
00:20:01,001 --> 00:20:02,167
Excuse me.

356
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:03,626
And over here.

357
00:20:04,501 --> 00:20:06,376
That must have made her mad.

358
00:20:06,376 --> 00:20:09,334
If I didn't kill her
I came real close because...

359
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:11,334
...she hollered like a pig
when they took her.

360
00:20:11,334 --> 00:20:12,751
You fool.

361
00:20:12,751 --> 00:20:14,751
Do you realize what you've done?

362
00:20:14,751 --> 00:20:16,126
Sure I do.

363
00:20:16,126 --> 00:20:18,709
I may be a street walker,
but I’ve got my pride.

364
00:20:18,709 --> 00:20:20,542
Oh, heavens.

365
00:20:20,542 --> 00:20:22,501
Shut that infamous mouth.

366
00:20:22,709 --> 00:20:25,334
You talk about pride after you...

367
00:20:25,334 --> 00:20:27,667
...committed the sin of homicide?

368
00:20:28,209 --> 00:20:30,501
You should worry about your guilt...

369
00:20:30,667 --> 00:20:32,501
...before it's too late.

370
00:20:32,667 --> 00:20:34,792
Don't say that, father.

371
00:20:35,042 --> 00:20:37,792
Oh, mother, it hurts so much.

372
00:20:37,917 --> 00:20:40,834
Do you have vinegar
for the wound?

373
00:20:40,834 --> 00:20:41,917
vinegar...

374
00:20:42,126 --> 00:20:43,834
where do you think you are?

375
00:20:43,834 --> 00:20:45,376
I have no such luxuries.

376
00:20:45,376 --> 00:20:46,834
Do something...

377
00:20:47,001 --> 00:20:49,584
...because it's getting very bad.

378
00:21:10,251 --> 00:21:12,709
Why am I seeing black?

379
00:21:13,001 --> 00:21:15,459
Why don't we let some air in?

380
00:21:16,917 --> 00:21:19,251
Don't tum me in, father.

381
00:21:20,626 --> 00:21:22,667
I'd rather die.

382
00:21:23,501 --> 00:21:25,792
You are good, I am evil.

383
00:21:26,292 --> 00:21:28,001
Don't tum me in.

384
00:21:29,542 --> 00:21:31,376
I won't tum you in.

385
00:21:31,834 --> 00:21:34,667
If you are not found,
it's up to god.

386
00:21:35,417 --> 00:21:37,917
As long as you're here,
I will help you.

387
00:21:38,834 --> 00:21:40,376
But it they should ask...

388
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:42,709
I cannot lie.

389
00:21:44,334 --> 00:21:45,876
Go on, father. Make a broth.

390
00:21:46,042 --> 00:21:48,001
Put some herbs in it.

391
00:21:48,501 --> 00:21:51,459
Forget the herbs, you poor wretch.

392
00:21:52,084 --> 00:21:53,876
Think of your sins.

393
00:21:53,876 --> 00:21:56,626
Your conscience must
be very heavy.

394
00:21:56,876 --> 00:22:00,334
Put your fate in god's
and the virgin Mary’s hands.

395
00:22:01,959 --> 00:22:03,751
I am here to help you.

396
00:22:03,751 --> 00:22:05,876
If you think of more
serious things...

397
00:22:05,876 --> 00:22:07,501
...than camella...

398
00:22:07,501 --> 00:22:09,292
your dignity...

399
00:22:09,501 --> 00:22:11,292
...and herbs.

400
00:22:12,251 --> 00:22:16,542
<i>Et tibi pater: Quia peccavi nimis
cogitatione verbo, et opere...</i>

401
00:22:16,542 --> 00:22:19,251
<i>mea culpa</i>

402
00:22:19,501 --> 00:22:21,501
<i>mea maxima culpa</i>

403
00:22:34,876 --> 00:22:36,001
let go of my son.

404
00:22:36,001 --> 00:22:38,501
Nobody lays a hand on him...

405
00:22:38,501 --> 00:22:39,292
...except me.

406
00:22:39,292 --> 00:22:41,001
He mustn't steal my sugar.

407
00:22:41,001 --> 00:22:42,834
Take him away, he's had dessert.

408
00:22:42,834 --> 00:22:44,084
Is the girl yours?

409
00:22:44,084 --> 00:22:45,751
No, she's your mother's.

410
00:22:45,751 --> 00:22:47,959
Hey, don't get mad...

411
00:22:47,959 --> 00:22:48,792
one-eye.

412
00:22:48,792 --> 00:22:51,376
A cup of coffee,
make it strong.

413
00:23:22,959 --> 00:23:24,376
Father Nazario.

414
00:23:25,084 --> 00:23:26,667
Father Nazario.

415
00:23:27,376 --> 00:23:29,459
Let's go, uncle, he is not in.

416
00:23:44,959 --> 00:23:46,001
I must go.

417
00:23:46,001 --> 00:23:48,251
I'm going to give him
the alms for today's mass.

418
00:23:48,251 --> 00:23:51,126
Next week I may
have something more.

419
00:23:51,126 --> 00:23:52,417
Thank you so much, Mr. Angel.

420
00:23:52,417 --> 00:23:53,751
You are always very helpful.

421
00:23:53,751 --> 00:23:55,792
You deserve it, Mr. Nazario.

422
00:23:56,292 --> 00:23:57,792
Here you are.

423
00:24:02,084 --> 00:24:04,417
I could use some broth, father...

424
00:24:04,501 --> 00:24:06,084
...but above all, some tequila.

425
00:24:06,209 --> 00:24:08,626
It's good for inner
and outer wounds.

426
00:24:08,834 --> 00:24:10,459
Go get it and come back soon.

427
00:24:10,626 --> 00:24:12,626
If you want something, ask.

428
00:24:12,834 --> 00:24:15,084
This is not a hostel
for criminals...

429
00:24:15,292 --> 00:24:17,084
...and I don't take orders from you.

430
00:24:17,459 --> 00:24:19,126
I'll go if I want to.

431
00:24:19,126 --> 00:24:21,126
And I’ll do as I please.

432
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,834
I have a coin in my pocket.

433
00:24:22,834 --> 00:24:24,501
Take it.

434
00:24:24,626 --> 00:24:26,292
I don't need your coin.

435
00:24:26,542 --> 00:24:28,584
If I did, I would ask you for it.

436
00:24:29,459 --> 00:24:32,542
Get the tequila at a distant bar.

437
00:24:32,792 --> 00:24:36,459
Not at Chato's. You're too innocent,
and he's too talkative.

438
00:24:36,459 --> 00:24:39,459
They would throw me out.

439
00:24:39,626 --> 00:24:42,542
Save your advice,
I know where to go.

440
00:24:48,001 --> 00:24:49,959
Try not to make noise.

441
00:24:59,501 --> 00:25:01,167
Oh, st. Anthony.

442
00:25:01,501 --> 00:25:03,542
They may ask the blessed priest...

443
00:25:03,542 --> 00:25:05,042
...to tell them everything.

444
00:25:05,042 --> 00:25:06,292
Don't let them find me...

445
00:25:06,376 --> 00:25:09,251
...and I’ll light a candle
for you on Tuesdays.

446
00:25:33,334 --> 00:25:34,917
Don't get mad if I say...

447
00:25:34,917 --> 00:25:36,751
...that I don't believe in hell.

448
00:25:36,751 --> 00:25:38,251
Tripas told me...

449
00:25:38,251 --> 00:25:40,376
...and he has read a lot.

450
00:25:40,376 --> 00:25:43,251
Pick between Mr. Tripas' opinion...

451
00:25:43,251 --> 00:25:44,459
...and mine.

452
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:47,584
No, no father.
You are more knowledgeable.

453
00:25:47,584 --> 00:25:49,459
Where does it end?

454
00:25:50,584 --> 00:25:55,042
When you're lying on a mat
do you know you're dead?

455
00:25:55,042 --> 00:25:58,042
Your soul knows it,
and it's immortal.

456
00:25:58,042 --> 00:26:00,667
I have some more questions.

457
00:26:00,667 --> 00:26:03,292
Well. Maybe since you
know so much...

458
00:26:03,292 --> 00:26:04,876
...you can teach me.

459
00:26:05,459 --> 00:26:07,334
How are people born?

460
00:26:08,001 --> 00:26:11,167
Why do chicks hatch from eggs
looking like chickens?

461
00:26:11,667 --> 00:26:14,667
Why are three buzzards bad
luck, and two are good?

462
00:26:17,084 --> 00:26:21,167
How come mice, small as
they are, are so cunning...

463
00:26:21,667 --> 00:26:24,001
...while rats are big and stupid?

464
00:26:24,501 --> 00:26:25,626
Something else...

465
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,834
why are souls released
from purgatory...

466
00:26:27,834 --> 00:26:29,876
...when you give priests money?

467
00:26:30,501 --> 00:26:32,126
Come on, tell me.

468
00:26:32,667 --> 00:26:35,084
Your head is full
of confusion, child.

469
00:26:35,501 --> 00:26:37,209
And superstition.

470
00:26:38,501 --> 00:26:39,626
Alas...

471
00:26:40,126 --> 00:26:41,834
...since there is nothing to do...

472
00:26:41,834 --> 00:26:43,792
...I will answer your questions.

473
00:26:44,042 --> 00:26:45,792
One by one.

474
00:26:46,334 --> 00:26:48,626
I'll begin my clearing
up the first...

475
00:26:48,626 --> 00:26:51,792
...which is the easiest,
yet most mysterious.

476
00:26:52,001 --> 00:26:53,459
Why are we born?

477
00:27:08,917 --> 00:27:10,334
You really got ahead.

478
00:27:10,542 --> 00:27:12,959
Don't come in, I’m bathing.

479
00:27:12,959 --> 00:27:15,376
Wait, I’ll be done in a minute.

480
00:27:18,709 --> 00:27:20,167
Why are you so late?

481
00:27:20,334 --> 00:27:22,459
I've been worried sick.

482
00:27:23,209 --> 00:27:24,959
You had to be a man.

483
00:27:24,959 --> 00:27:27,959
I have no reason to explain
my actions to you.

484
00:27:42,792 --> 00:27:45,042
You filled the house
of your perfume.

485
00:27:45,042 --> 00:27:47,001
Don't you like it?

486
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:50,126
I prefer the smell
of wild flowers, child.

487
00:27:51,167 --> 00:27:53,126
You cannot come in, father.

488
00:27:59,501 --> 00:28:00,834
What is it?

489
00:28:02,126 --> 00:28:04,292
Why do you cover your face?

490
00:28:05,501 --> 00:28:07,084
Tell me, what happened?

491
00:28:10,167 --> 00:28:12,084
I'm ashamed of you seeing me.

492
00:28:12,292 --> 00:28:14,667
You should have been
more ashamed before.

493
00:28:14,876 --> 00:28:16,542
This is who you should be.

494
00:28:16,751 --> 00:28:17,959
Not the other one.

495
00:28:18,501 --> 00:28:20,376
I'm almost out of pain, father.

496
00:28:20,584 --> 00:28:22,084
I can go now.

497
00:28:22,417 --> 00:28:24,084
I'm not throwing you out.

498
00:28:24,084 --> 00:28:26,167
But if you're cured, you should go.

499
00:28:26,167 --> 00:28:28,542
It isn't right to have
a woman in my room.

500
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:32,417
Do you think I don't know that?

501
00:28:32,834 --> 00:28:35,334
You won't have to see me tomorrow.

502
00:28:35,334 --> 00:28:36,626
You'll never see me again.

503
00:28:36,792 --> 00:28:41,251
Tamales, hot tamales.

504
00:28:41,376 --> 00:28:43,167
Tamales, father.

505
00:28:46,042 --> 00:28:49,751
Tamales, get your hot tamales.

506
00:28:49,751 --> 00:28:51,709
I just found out where she is.

507
00:28:52,251 --> 00:28:54,042
And she's really close, too.

508
00:28:54,876 --> 00:28:56,417
Pay me to keep quiet.

509
00:28:56,417 --> 00:28:57,584
I will not.

510
00:28:57,751 --> 00:28:58,667
You Judas.

511
00:28:59,584 --> 00:29:01,334
You'll sell a friend
out for money?

512
00:29:01,667 --> 00:29:02,917
Friend...

513
00:29:03,209 --> 00:29:06,126
I want money,
I’ve had enough lectures.

514
00:29:06,917 --> 00:29:08,417
So, will you pay me?

515
00:29:08,417 --> 00:29:09,459
No.

516
00:29:10,876 --> 00:29:12,417
I'm going straight to the police.

517
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,001
Each will fight for his own life

518
00:29:14,001 --> 00:29:15,792
what evil has Andara done you?

519
00:29:15,792 --> 00:29:18,459
You will never set
foot in my house again.

520
00:29:26,167 --> 00:29:27,334
Cinnamon.

521
00:29:27,334 --> 00:29:28,792
Cinnamon, come here.

522
00:29:31,834 --> 00:29:32,542
Andara.

523
00:29:32,792 --> 00:29:33,459
Andara.

524
00:29:33,667 --> 00:29:35,501
Open up, for Christ’s sake.

525
00:29:36,001 --> 00:29:38,334
Father nazario, open up.

526
00:29:38,501 --> 00:29:39,542
Wait.

527
00:29:39,834 --> 00:29:40,792
What for?

528
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,626
Cinnamon turned her in.

529
00:29:56,626 --> 00:29:58,334
The police will be here soon.

530
00:29:58,334 --> 00:30:01,042
If they find her with you
they'll take you in, too.

531
00:30:01,251 --> 00:30:03,251
Come with me now that it's dark.

532
00:30:03,251 --> 00:30:05,126
You can hide in my room.

533
00:30:05,126 --> 00:30:06,834
They'd find her there, too.

534
00:30:07,459 --> 00:30:08,417
Let them.

535
00:30:08,417 --> 00:30:10,209
Let them take me in, too.

536
00:30:10,209 --> 00:30:11,709
I hope they hang me.

537
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:13,626
That's all I’m good for.

538
00:30:19,834 --> 00:30:21,001
What's wrong with you, Mrs. Chanfa?

539
00:30:21,001 --> 00:30:22,501
The farce is over.

540
00:30:23,709 --> 00:30:26,751
I threw you out the day before
yesterday because of the smell.

541
00:30:26,751 --> 00:30:29,334
I didn't say anything
on account of the priest.

542
00:30:29,917 --> 00:30:32,126
Go, they shan't catch you
in this house.

543
00:30:32,292 --> 00:30:33,876
Use the other staircase.

544
00:30:33,876 --> 00:30:36,001
What will they do to the priest?

545
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:36,876
Go on, now.

546
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:38,667
Wash the floor you stepped on so...

547
00:30:38,667 --> 00:30:40,501
...they don't smell you were here.

548
00:30:42,501 --> 00:30:44,501
And you, you must leave right away.

549
00:30:44,501 --> 00:30:47,001
They will come around asking
if we saw you...

550
00:30:47,001 --> 00:30:50,001
...and we still have to scrub
all this and you're in the way.

551
00:30:50,501 --> 00:30:53,209
I was on my way to angel's
house to discuss...

552
00:30:53,209 --> 00:30:54,751
so, go over there now.

553
00:30:56,876 --> 00:30:58,167
Lend me the sponge...

554
00:30:58,167 --> 00:30:59,709
...and bring some water.

555
00:30:59,709 --> 00:31:01,209
Lend me a sponge.

556
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:10,709
You are going to help me.

557
00:31:10,709 --> 00:31:12,667
Bring all the petroleum you can.

558
00:32:00,167 --> 00:32:01,167
Hurry up.

559
00:32:01,167 --> 00:32:04,126
I'll be in the kitchen
like nothing happened.

560
00:32:34,417 --> 00:32:36,001
What are you doing?

561
00:33:16,167 --> 00:33:17,501
The smell that was here...

562
00:33:17,667 --> 00:33:19,542
...it'll go away with fire.

563
00:33:49,584 --> 00:33:51,126
Fire!

564
00:33:51,792 --> 00:33:54,501
Fire!

565
00:34:28,792 --> 00:34:30,209
How's the manufacture coming along?

566
00:34:30,209 --> 00:34:31,667
Good morning, Mr. Ángel.

567
00:34:31,959 --> 00:34:33,459
Do these suit you?

568
00:34:34,376 --> 00:34:36,292
They're fine, thank you.

569
00:34:39,667 --> 00:34:41,084
Look, Mr. Nazario.

570
00:34:41,167 --> 00:34:43,084
The friendlier, the clearer.

571
00:34:43,376 --> 00:34:45,001
Do you know where I’ve been?

572
00:34:45,001 --> 00:34:46,167
To see the judge.

573
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:48,167
And do you know what he said?

574
00:34:49,084 --> 00:34:50,501
That you are nuts.

575
00:34:50,834 --> 00:34:54,667
How could you admit
you knew about the fight...

576
00:34:54,834 --> 00:34:57,001
...and that you hid that woman?

577
00:34:57,417 --> 00:34:59,667
There is only one way
of telling the truth.

578
00:34:59,834 --> 00:35:00,792
Telling it.

579
00:35:01,001 --> 00:35:04,292
Now they're saying you had
a scandalous, dishonest...

580
00:35:04,292 --> 00:35:07,001
...and dirty relationship
with that woman.

581
00:35:07,126 --> 00:35:08,084
Slander.

582
00:35:08,334 --> 00:35:09,292
Plain slander.

583
00:35:09,292 --> 00:35:11,084
I know you wouldn't dare.

584
00:35:11,251 --> 00:35:14,834
Besides, if you were to
succumb to such a demon...

585
00:35:14,834 --> 00:35:16,917
...it wouldn't be
with that ugly creature.

586
00:35:17,251 --> 00:35:19,417
Here's the chocolate.

587
00:35:19,626 --> 00:35:22,834
Sit down, Mr. Nazario,
I have more to say.

588
00:35:34,792 --> 00:35:37,001
To top things off, they are...

589
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:40,001
...implicating you in the
fire that destroyed the hostel.

590
00:35:40,001 --> 00:35:41,334
In the fire?

591
00:35:41,542 --> 00:35:42,501
Me?

592
00:35:42,501 --> 00:35:44,084
Yes, sir. You.

593
00:35:44,459 --> 00:35:46,459
So, what are you going to do?

594
00:35:46,834 --> 00:35:48,459
God is my tribunal.

595
00:35:48,459 --> 00:35:49,709
I submit to him.

596
00:35:49,917 --> 00:35:52,001
I will accept in resignation...

597
00:35:52,001 --> 00:35:54,376
...the pain that human evil...

598
00:35:56,292 --> 00:35:57,251
...may afflict upon me.

599
00:35:57,251 --> 00:35:59,334
The bishop is aware.

600
00:35:59,334 --> 00:36:01,917
There may even be
an investigation.

601
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:05,251
That will cost you
your preaching.

602
00:36:07,334 --> 00:36:08,959
What do you say to that?

603
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:12,001
That I shall obey with resignation...

604
00:36:12,001 --> 00:36:14,001
...my boss's determination.

605
00:36:14,001 --> 00:36:15,834
But if you are relieved of your...

606
00:36:15,834 --> 00:36:18,042
...license while in this house,
it would be...

607
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:20,376
...very painful for my mother.

608
00:36:20,667 --> 00:36:22,667
She cares deeply for you, and...

609
00:36:22,834 --> 00:36:25,084
...I would prefer to
spare her the pain...

610
00:36:25,626 --> 00:36:27,084
...and that vendetta.

611
00:36:27,459 --> 00:36:29,126
You are right.

612
00:36:29,126 --> 00:36:30,751
I have to spare that lady...

613
00:36:30,751 --> 00:36:33,251
...who has been so kind
as to put me up...

614
00:36:33,251 --> 00:36:34,667
...in her home such sorrow.

615
00:36:34,917 --> 00:36:37,042
I shall leave at
this precise moment.

616
00:36:37,292 --> 00:36:39,001
Fortunately, everything I possess...

617
00:36:39,001 --> 00:36:40,376
...is on me.

618
00:36:40,667 --> 00:36:41,751
So...

619
00:36:41,751 --> 00:36:44,167
...after expressing to you
my utmost gratitude...

620
00:36:44,376 --> 00:36:47,959
heavens, Mr. Nazario,
this is not a game.

621
00:36:48,459 --> 00:36:51,459
Sit down and
drink your chocolate.

622
00:36:57,959 --> 00:36:59,459
Do you know where you're going?

623
00:36:59,626 --> 00:37:01,334
If they are taking my license...

624
00:37:01,334 --> 00:37:02,876
...I shall do what I always wanted.

625
00:37:03,001 --> 00:37:04,126
Move to the countryside.

626
00:37:04,334 --> 00:37:06,834
Where I will feel close to god.

627
00:37:08,001 --> 00:37:09,042
All right.

628
00:37:09,042 --> 00:37:11,042
But how will you support yourself?

629
00:37:11,042 --> 00:37:12,292
I'll beg.

630
00:37:12,417 --> 00:37:13,167
What?

631
00:37:13,334 --> 00:37:15,251
A priest, begging?

632
00:37:15,417 --> 00:37:17,501
Don't forget priestly dignity.

633
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:18,542
Don't worry.

634
00:37:18,709 --> 00:37:20,959
Nobody will notice...

635
00:37:21,126 --> 00:37:22,917
...that I am a priest.

636
00:37:51,751 --> 00:37:53,126
Good afternoon, sir.

637
00:37:53,334 --> 00:37:56,167
Would you give me charity
in the form of food?

638
00:37:56,251 --> 00:37:58,376
We don't feed bums here.

639
00:37:58,626 --> 00:38:01,167
I can work in exchange.

640
00:38:01,167 --> 00:38:02,876
Now, that's different.

641
00:38:03,084 --> 00:38:04,667
Wait.

642
00:38:06,167 --> 00:38:07,376
Hey, you.

643
00:38:08,209 --> 00:38:10,542
Give him a cart.

644
00:38:26,501 --> 00:38:27,792
Thank you.

645
00:38:47,709 --> 00:38:49,667
They denied my
cousin work yesterday.

646
00:38:50,042 --> 00:38:50,834
Of course.

647
00:38:51,001 --> 00:38:52,626
He demanded a salary.

648
00:38:52,626 --> 00:38:54,417
He wouldn't work for food.

649
00:38:54,417 --> 00:38:57,584
There are ten men in town
waiting their tum.

650
00:38:59,417 --> 00:39:00,834
What shall we tell this one?

651
00:39:00,834 --> 00:39:02,042
Leave it to me.

652
00:39:03,917 --> 00:39:04,959
All right.

653
00:39:17,709 --> 00:39:18,792
You know.

654
00:39:46,501 --> 00:39:47,584
What is it?

655
00:39:47,792 --> 00:39:48,709
Where are you going?

656
00:39:48,959 --> 00:39:50,042
I'm sorry, sir.

657
00:39:50,042 --> 00:39:51,626
I am on my way.

658
00:40:17,834 --> 00:40:19,626
Pretty good, huh?

659
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:21,626
What did they say?

660
00:40:21,959 --> 00:40:24,167
Who was the brave man
who threw you out?

661
00:40:24,417 --> 00:40:26,251
If you can, answer me.

662
00:40:26,251 --> 00:40:28,084
I'm the one who threw him out.

663
00:40:28,667 --> 00:40:31,334
Working for food
is bad for all of us.

664
00:40:31,334 --> 00:40:33,751
- Of course it is.
- That's why.

665
00:40:35,376 --> 00:40:37,792
And that's just in the meantime.

666
00:40:39,626 --> 00:40:41,417
What a scoundrel.

667
00:40:41,417 --> 00:40:43,542
Careful, his hand.

668
00:41:08,834 --> 00:41:10,959
A coin, for the love of god.

669
00:41:13,334 --> 00:41:14,959
May god repay you.

670
00:41:27,501 --> 00:41:29,084
Father nazario.

671
00:41:29,376 --> 00:41:30,751
Hello, Beatriz.

672
00:41:31,001 --> 00:41:33,001
It's a miracle I should find you.

673
00:41:33,001 --> 00:41:34,167
Why, child?

674
00:41:34,167 --> 00:41:35,959
It's a big world.

675
00:41:37,584 --> 00:41:39,834
What happened,
why are you like this?

676
00:41:39,834 --> 00:41:41,459
I am on a pilgrimage.

677
00:41:41,709 --> 00:41:43,209
Barefoot?

678
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:46,084
I spent the night
with a poor family.

679
00:41:46,084 --> 00:41:48,626
I gave my boots to the
eldest, who was ill.

680
00:41:49,126 --> 00:41:50,459
And the rest of the things?

681
00:41:50,459 --> 00:41:52,001
You must have had something.

682
00:41:52,167 --> 00:41:55,167
A man with the venerable
look of a priest...

683
00:41:55,251 --> 00:41:57,584
...took my bag and my blanket.

684
00:41:57,584 --> 00:41:59,709
It wasn't worth a dime anyway.

685
00:41:59,834 --> 00:42:00,959
What are you doing here?

686
00:42:01,167 --> 00:42:02,917
I live with my widowed sister.

687
00:42:03,792 --> 00:42:05,876
Andara is also with us.

688
00:42:06,501 --> 00:42:07,834
In god's name.

689
00:42:07,834 --> 00:42:10,084
So that fool is here?

690
00:42:10,667 --> 00:42:13,001
It was good seeing you.
God be with you.

691
00:42:15,834 --> 00:42:17,251
My house is close by.

692
00:42:17,251 --> 00:42:19,251
- Come with me, father.
- Sorry.

693
00:42:19,251 --> 00:42:22,001
I must beg for a blanket and food.

694
00:42:22,001 --> 00:42:23,959
- Some other day.
- We will give it to you.

695
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:26,334
My sister has her husband's clothes.

696
00:42:26,334 --> 00:42:27,626
Help us, father.

697
00:42:27,626 --> 00:42:29,042
Help us.

698
00:42:29,334 --> 00:42:31,251
My niece is terribly ill.

699
00:42:31,251 --> 00:42:33,251
Andara says over and over...

700
00:42:33,251 --> 00:42:37,167
"if blessed father nazario
were here, he would cure her."

701
00:42:37,334 --> 00:42:38,834
To the point where my sister...

702
00:42:38,834 --> 00:42:40,751
...wanted to go look for you.

703
00:42:41,334 --> 00:42:43,084
You believe that crazy woman?

704
00:42:45,709 --> 00:42:47,001
Please, father.

705
00:42:47,001 --> 00:42:48,292
My sister is suffering.

706
00:42:48,376 --> 00:42:50,792
Please come and comfort her.

707
00:42:51,542 --> 00:42:52,292
All right.

708
00:42:52,959 --> 00:42:55,917
I cannot refuse
saying some words of comfort...

709
00:42:56,334 --> 00:42:57,917
...and praying to god for her.

710
00:42:58,209 --> 00:43:00,001
Not a word about anything else.

711
00:43:13,501 --> 00:43:14,626
Josefa.

712
00:43:16,334 --> 00:43:18,251
Here comes father nazario.

713
00:43:18,251 --> 00:43:19,917
Father nazario.

714
00:43:19,917 --> 00:43:21,417
Our lady of Guadalupe.

715
00:43:21,417 --> 00:43:22,792
I don't want him to see me.

716
00:43:22,792 --> 00:43:23,876
Well.

717
00:43:24,834 --> 00:43:26,709
Put that on the girl.

718
00:43:40,001 --> 00:43:42,292
God called you to
this house, father.

719
00:43:42,292 --> 00:43:45,459
- I know you're a saint.
- Don't say that.

720
00:43:45,959 --> 00:43:47,292
So, how is your daughter?

721
00:43:47,292 --> 00:43:49,001
She's slipping away, father.

722
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:52,001
If you don't do something,
she won't see tomorrow.

723
00:43:52,001 --> 00:43:54,709
Only god and science
can help her.

724
00:43:54,709 --> 00:43:56,667
Come father, sit down.

725
00:43:57,709 --> 00:43:59,126
What ails the girl?

726
00:43:59,334 --> 00:44:02,001
High fevers are devouring her.

727
00:44:02,417 --> 00:44:04,042
The day she fell ill...

728
00:44:04,042 --> 00:44:06,126
...I felt something bad approaching...

729
00:44:06,126 --> 00:44:08,751
...because an owl chirped all night.

730
00:44:09,209 --> 00:44:10,751
And when I went out...

731
00:44:10,917 --> 00:44:12,709
...three dogs howled.

732
00:44:12,917 --> 00:44:14,501
One after the other.

733
00:44:14,501 --> 00:44:16,209
- Has a doctor seen her?
- Yes, father.

734
00:44:16,209 --> 00:44:17,626
He sent her this.

735
00:44:17,834 --> 00:44:19,292
She's already taken two bottles.

736
00:44:19,501 --> 00:44:22,667
They gave her a cleansing,
but it didn't work.

737
00:44:22,834 --> 00:44:24,042
Oh, father.

738
00:44:24,292 --> 00:44:25,709
I have prayed so.

739
00:44:25,709 --> 00:44:28,001
Follow the doctor's orders.

740
00:44:28,001 --> 00:44:30,667
You must have resignation
and trust in god.

741
00:44:31,334 --> 00:44:33,626
Only a miracle can save her.

742
00:44:34,042 --> 00:44:36,709
God began by bringing
you to this town.

743
00:44:36,709 --> 00:44:38,084
You arrived barefoot...

744
00:44:38,084 --> 00:44:40,501
...just like our lord Jesus Christ.

745
00:44:40,876 --> 00:44:44,292
Save my daughter, father, save her.

746
00:44:44,626 --> 00:44:46,626
If I didn't see the pain
impairing you...

747
00:44:46,626 --> 00:44:48,251
...I would leave right now.

748
00:44:49,001 --> 00:44:51,251
How can I do that
which science cannot?

749
00:44:51,251 --> 00:44:53,751
I know that you can perform miracles.

750
00:44:53,751 --> 00:44:54,834
You can.

751
00:44:54,834 --> 00:44:57,292
Yes, it's obvious
that you're a saint.

752
00:44:57,292 --> 00:45:00,334
Say the consecration
prayer, and she shall heal.

753
00:45:00,334 --> 00:45:01,459
Do it, father.

754
00:45:01,459 --> 00:45:03,459
What this poor mother has to say.

755
00:45:03,459 --> 00:45:04,501
A miracle.

756
00:45:04,501 --> 00:45:06,709
- Perform a miracle.
- Blasphemy, ignorant.

757
00:45:06,834 --> 00:45:08,001
A miracle, me?

758
00:45:08,001 --> 00:45:10,501
Yes, sir. A miracle.

759
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:13,834
If you refuse, it'll only...

760
00:45:13,834 --> 00:45:15,959
...be because you don't want to.

761
00:45:16,126 --> 00:45:18,167
It had to be you, you fool.

762
00:45:18,251 --> 00:45:19,417
Who do you take me for?

763
00:45:19,417 --> 00:45:21,126
Am I an impostor?

764
00:45:21,126 --> 00:45:23,084
Do I try to deceive people?

765
00:45:24,084 --> 00:45:26,834
Don't mention miracles,
don't tease me.

766
00:45:26,834 --> 00:45:28,667
Have compassion on me.

767
00:45:28,667 --> 00:45:29,917
Help my sister.

768
00:45:29,917 --> 00:45:32,334
- Doesn't it pain you to see her?
- Quiet.

769
00:45:32,334 --> 00:45:34,001
I am not a healer.

770
00:45:34,751 --> 00:45:37,501
If god chooses to take her,
it is best for her soul.

771
00:45:37,667 --> 00:45:39,584
That is manifested by pain.

772
00:45:40,376 --> 00:45:42,834
I can only pray with you.

773
00:45:44,376 --> 00:45:45,584
Where is she?

774
00:45:45,584 --> 00:45:47,001
Over here, father.

775
00:46:10,126 --> 00:46:13,126
Lord, restore this
innocent soul's health.

776
00:46:13,667 --> 00:46:16,292
I offer you in tum
my health and my life...

777
00:46:16,792 --> 00:46:20,292
...and I humbly accept all
obstacles and calamities...

778
00:46:20,709 --> 00:46:22,417
...all diseases and pain...

779
00:46:22,834 --> 00:46:24,667
...that may afflict a man.

780
00:46:26,209 --> 00:46:29,334
Help us, our lord of Chalma.

781
00:46:29,751 --> 00:46:32,417
Aid us, lord, aid us.

782
00:46:32,417 --> 00:46:34,751
Go away, devil, respect this house.

783
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:37,209
Out with you Satan,
there is nothing for you here.

784
00:46:37,334 --> 00:46:40,167
Help us on the holy cross,
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.

785
00:46:40,334 --> 00:46:43,334
Do not forsake us, protect us.

786
00:46:43,667 --> 00:46:45,876
Do not leave us.

787
00:46:45,876 --> 00:46:47,167
Help us.

788
00:46:47,167 --> 00:46:49,917
On heaven as it is on earth...

789
00:46:49,917 --> 00:46:51,626
free us.

790
00:46:56,917 --> 00:46:59,459
Holy, holy, holy.

791
00:47:00,084 --> 00:47:02,542
Our father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

792
00:47:02,542 --> 00:47:03,584
Thy kingdom come.

793
00:47:03,584 --> 00:47:06,417
Thy will be done on earth
as it is in heaven.

794
00:47:06,417 --> 00:47:08,167
Give us this day our daily bread.

795
00:47:08,167 --> 00:47:09,626
Forgive our trespasses
as we forgive...

796
00:47:09,626 --> 00:47:11,126
...those who trespass against us.

797
00:47:11,126 --> 00:47:12,792
Lead us not into temptation.

798
00:47:12,917 --> 00:47:15,459
Deliver us from evil. Amen.

799
00:47:15,459 --> 00:47:18,084
Our father who are in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

800
00:47:18,084 --> 00:47:19,376
Thy kingdom come.

801
00:47:19,376 --> 00:47:22,251
Thy will be done on earth
as it is in heaven.

802
00:47:22,251 --> 00:47:23,709
Give us our daily bread...

803
00:47:53,834 --> 00:47:55,459
father nazario...

804
00:47:55,709 --> 00:47:57,542
...the girl is well.

805
00:47:57,667 --> 00:47:59,001
At dawn she was dying...

806
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:01,501
...and suddenly she
asked me for food.

807
00:48:01,501 --> 00:48:04,167
I touched her forehead,
it was no longer burning.

808
00:48:05,834 --> 00:48:07,126
Don't go, father.

809
00:48:07,126 --> 00:48:08,334
The news has spread.

810
00:48:08,334 --> 00:48:10,376
They want to touch her.

811
00:48:10,376 --> 00:48:11,334
All right, all right.

812
00:48:11,667 --> 00:48:14,834
You don't need to talk
nonsense.

813
00:48:15,792 --> 00:48:18,251
Get up woman,
stop thinking tall tales.

814
00:48:23,126 --> 00:48:25,167
I said you wouldn't convince him.

815
00:48:25,917 --> 00:48:28,667
It's a miracle. A miracle.

816
00:48:28,667 --> 00:48:30,042
I'm leaving, you're insane.

817
00:48:30,376 --> 00:48:31,834
Devote your prayers...

818
00:48:31,834 --> 00:48:34,167
...to giving thanks for
the grace you were granted...

819
00:48:34,376 --> 00:48:35,292
...and to god.

820
00:49:03,584 --> 00:49:05,417
Where are you going?

821
00:49:05,542 --> 00:49:07,417
Wherever you go, father...

822
00:49:07,751 --> 00:49:09,334
...we will follow...

823
00:49:09,334 --> 00:49:11,917
...because we want
to be pilgrims, too.

824
00:49:11,917 --> 00:49:14,542
And as good and saintly as you.

825
00:49:14,792 --> 00:49:16,417
I admire your intention...

826
00:49:16,417 --> 00:49:19,876
...but do me a favor
and be saintly on your own.

827
00:49:20,709 --> 00:49:23,126
Do you think I’m mad enough
to take you along?

828
00:49:27,001 --> 00:49:28,209
Just look...

829
00:49:28,209 --> 00:49:30,001
...at what was upon me.

830
00:49:42,334 --> 00:49:44,834
It must have broken a leg.

831
00:49:44,834 --> 00:49:46,917
That damned beast.

832
00:49:46,917 --> 00:49:48,876
Patience, colonel.

833
00:49:50,417 --> 00:49:52,417
I told you not to use this one.

834
00:49:52,417 --> 00:49:54,334
That's all we needed.

835
00:49:54,334 --> 00:49:57,167
But these animals think
they're smarter than us.

836
00:49:58,417 --> 00:50:01,251
It chose a hell of a time
to get a cramp.

837
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:05,084
Good morning, gentlemen.

838
00:50:07,334 --> 00:50:08,709
May I help you?

839
00:50:08,709 --> 00:50:09,584
Go ahead.

840
00:50:09,584 --> 00:50:11,876
Take the head,
I’ll take this side.

841
00:50:27,334 --> 00:50:28,667
Hey you, donkey.

842
00:50:32,292 --> 00:50:34,876
What's wrong with you?

843
00:50:34,876 --> 00:50:37,084
Don't you know a colonel
and especially a priest...

844
00:50:37,084 --> 00:50:39,751
...should always be greeted?

845
00:50:40,584 --> 00:50:42,376
You won't believe it, boss.

846
00:50:42,376 --> 00:50:45,084
I was figuring out
how much I sold...

847
00:50:45,084 --> 00:50:46,834
...and I wasn't looking.

848
00:50:47,501 --> 00:50:49,167
Well, so you learn to look...

849
00:50:49,167 --> 00:50:51,376
...walk by again and greet us.

850
00:50:51,834 --> 00:50:52,792
Let's go!

851
00:51:06,209 --> 00:51:08,667
- Good morning, boss.
- Good morning.

852
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:21,792
Sir...

853
00:51:22,001 --> 00:51:24,001
...you may think of me as you please...

854
00:51:24,084 --> 00:51:26,167
...but I believe that such treatment...

855
00:51:26,167 --> 00:51:28,501
...is anti-christian and rude.

856
00:51:29,792 --> 00:51:31,584
This is a man, not an animal.

857
00:51:32,001 --> 00:51:33,626
A son of god, as much as you.

858
00:51:33,626 --> 00:51:36,042
And he has his dignity
in spite of any...

859
00:51:36,042 --> 00:51:38,001
...past, present or future despot.

860
00:51:39,417 --> 00:51:41,792
After relieving my conscience so...

861
00:51:42,584 --> 00:51:43,792
...I will go.

862
00:51:46,334 --> 00:51:48,584
What kind of scoundrel is that?

863
00:51:49,501 --> 00:51:51,084
Forget it, colonel.

864
00:51:51,251 --> 00:51:52,626
He's a heretic.

865
00:51:53,001 --> 00:51:56,126
One of those eccentric preachers...

866
00:51:56,126 --> 00:51:58,292
...they send from the north.

867
00:51:59,709 --> 00:52:02,167
Forget him and arrange the horse.

868
00:52:02,167 --> 00:52:04,459
We've been here over an hour.

869
00:52:26,834 --> 00:52:28,459
Why are you following me?

870
00:52:28,667 --> 00:52:30,501
The road belongs to everybody.

871
00:52:30,501 --> 00:52:33,626
We want to do penance
and learn good things from you.

872
00:52:33,626 --> 00:52:35,667
I said, if you want to do penance...

873
00:52:35,667 --> 00:52:37,251
...to do it on your own.

874
00:52:37,501 --> 00:52:39,251
Each to his own conscience.

875
00:52:39,501 --> 00:52:40,792
Each to his own solitude.

876
00:52:40,834 --> 00:52:42,501
We will not get in the way.

877
00:52:42,501 --> 00:52:44,251
Well!

878
00:52:44,334 --> 00:52:46,001
We truly are fond of him...

879
00:52:46,001 --> 00:52:47,584
...and he pays us in this manner.

880
00:52:47,876 --> 00:52:50,834
If you abandon us who
knows what will happen.

881
00:52:51,417 --> 00:52:52,459
All right.

882
00:52:52,626 --> 00:52:53,542
Come along.

883
00:52:54,167 --> 00:52:56,292
But you must promise
to act decently.

884
00:52:56,501 --> 00:52:57,834
To be obedient...

885
00:52:58,292 --> 00:53:00,001
...and leave me alone.

886
00:53:12,667 --> 00:53:14,459
I believe in god the
father almighty.

887
00:53:14,751 --> 00:53:16,501
Creator of heaven and earth.

888
00:53:16,501 --> 00:53:18,209
Means that I believe...

889
00:53:18,209 --> 00:53:20,584
...without a doubt,
in the lord our father...

890
00:53:20,584 --> 00:53:23,167
...the first person
of the holy trinity.

891
00:53:23,501 --> 00:53:24,209
Who...

892
00:53:24,334 --> 00:53:26,167
...through his virtue of
omnipotence...

893
00:53:26,167 --> 00:53:27,376
...created from nothing.

894
00:53:27,376 --> 00:53:28,292
That is...

895
00:53:28,376 --> 00:53:29,667
...where there was nothing...

896
00:53:29,667 --> 00:53:32,501
...the earth and everything in it.

897
00:53:33,792 --> 00:53:35,667
Is god everywhere?

898
00:53:36,126 --> 00:53:37,042
Yes, everywhere.

899
00:53:37,626 --> 00:53:39,001
Is he here, too?

900
00:53:39,001 --> 00:53:39,584
Yes.

901
00:53:42,501 --> 00:53:44,917
Then, eating this is
like communion, isn't it?

902
00:53:44,917 --> 00:53:45,917
No, child.

903
00:53:46,126 --> 00:53:47,834
When the priest consecrates...

904
00:53:47,834 --> 00:53:50,334
...the lord descends into the bread.

905
00:53:50,459 --> 00:53:52,334
Just as you would.

906
00:53:52,334 --> 00:53:53,084
Father...

907
00:53:53,834 --> 00:53:56,876
...if I take communion,
will the demons get out?

908
00:53:57,126 --> 00:53:58,584
What demons would those be?

909
00:53:58,709 --> 00:54:00,584
The ones she has inside.

910
00:54:00,667 --> 00:54:02,376
The poor thing is full of them.

911
00:54:02,376 --> 00:54:05,251
My sister says I have
heart spasms.

912
00:54:05,417 --> 00:54:06,834
That's a curse.

913
00:54:07,042 --> 00:54:08,542
Somebody who wishes you evil.

914
00:54:08,542 --> 00:54:10,292
How many times must I tell you...

915
00:54:10,292 --> 00:54:12,167
...that those are only superstitions?

916
00:54:12,167 --> 00:54:13,709
When I felt short of breath, I felt...

917
00:54:13,834 --> 00:54:16,209
...a ball of fire in my stomach.

918
00:54:16,917 --> 00:54:18,709
And I felt like killing.

919
00:54:19,667 --> 00:54:21,876
That's not witchcraft or demons.

920
00:54:22,001 --> 00:54:24,001
It's a well known illness.

921
00:54:24,334 --> 00:54:25,876
It stems from imagination.

922
00:54:26,334 --> 00:54:28,876
And the cure comes
from imagination.

923
00:54:29,084 --> 00:54:30,042
Plus...

924
00:54:30,459 --> 00:54:31,334
...a healthy life...

925
00:54:31,501 --> 00:54:32,501
...and exercise.

926
00:54:32,876 --> 00:54:34,334
Reject sorrow.

927
00:54:35,334 --> 00:54:36,167
Pray.

928
00:54:36,542 --> 00:54:37,709
You'll get over it.

929
00:54:37,834 --> 00:54:40,376
I think they are demons.

930
00:54:57,917 --> 00:54:58,959
What's wrong?

931
00:54:59,334 --> 00:55:01,001
Why are you fleeing?

932
00:55:01,001 --> 00:55:02,542
Listen.

933
00:55:04,251 --> 00:55:05,709
Why are you fleeing?

934
00:55:06,001 --> 00:55:07,376
Why?

935
00:55:08,876 --> 00:55:11,459
What are you doing, father?

936
00:55:13,251 --> 00:55:14,292
Beatriz.

937
00:55:14,459 --> 00:55:16,001
Andara, come here.

938
00:55:16,001 --> 00:55:17,709
Don't touch him.

939
00:55:18,209 --> 00:55:20,667
Don't touch him, Mr. Nazario,
it's the plague.

940
00:55:20,876 --> 00:55:23,376
Everybody is leaving town,
it is infected.

941
00:55:23,501 --> 00:55:24,834
Let's go back.

942
00:55:25,084 --> 00:55:26,376
Run, father.

943
00:56:20,834 --> 00:56:22,001
Please.

944
00:56:22,626 --> 00:56:25,542
Could you show us to
town hall, sir?

945
00:56:26,917 --> 00:56:29,292
I am the municipal authority.

946
00:56:29,626 --> 00:56:31,292
And I order you to go away.

947
00:56:31,542 --> 00:56:33,584
We cannot support beggars.

948
00:56:33,584 --> 00:56:35,542
We haven't come to beg, sir.

949
00:56:35,709 --> 00:56:37,584
We just want to help.

950
00:56:37,584 --> 00:56:40,084
Caring for the sick,
burying the dead.

951
00:56:40,209 --> 00:56:41,501
Cleaning.

952
00:56:41,501 --> 00:56:43,209
In that case, you can stay.

953
00:56:43,209 --> 00:56:45,167
We need a lot of help.

954
00:56:46,126 --> 00:56:47,584
Where shall we begin?

955
00:56:47,959 --> 00:56:49,917
Go to any house.

956
00:56:50,084 --> 00:56:51,084
You'll be needed.

957
00:57:27,626 --> 00:57:28,459
Help me.

958
00:57:28,459 --> 00:57:30,292
Andara, open that window.

959
00:57:31,376 --> 00:57:33,042
Did you hear me?

960
00:57:37,126 --> 00:57:39,584
Beatriz, come here.

961
00:57:43,917 --> 00:57:44,501
Here.

962
00:57:45,084 --> 00:57:46,501
Take the child.

963
00:57:50,167 --> 00:57:50,917
Andara...

964
00:57:50,917 --> 00:57:52,209
go look for milk.

965
00:57:52,209 --> 00:57:53,917
- Where?
- Anywhere.

966
00:58:38,251 --> 00:58:39,292
Juan...

967
00:58:39,667 --> 00:58:41,876
what about the government support?

968
00:58:41,876 --> 00:58:43,001
Is it coming or not?

969
00:58:43,001 --> 00:58:44,542
I saw them from the hill.

970
00:58:44,542 --> 00:58:45,584
It was about time.

971
00:58:45,876 --> 00:58:46,959
Where's Lucia?

972
00:58:46,959 --> 00:58:48,501
Somebody's caring for her.

973
00:58:48,501 --> 00:58:49,709
Hey, how many are coming?

974
00:58:49,709 --> 00:58:51,292
Wait, Juan!

975
00:58:51,834 --> 00:58:54,501
<i>...sed pro tua pietate
prosit mihi ad...</i>

976
00:58:54,792 --> 00:58:57,834
<i>...tutamentum mentis et corporis,
et ad medelam percipiendam:</i>

977
00:58:57,834 --> 00:59:02,251
<i>Qui vivis et regnas deus, per omnia
saecula saeculorum. Amen.</i>

978
00:59:08,667 --> 00:59:10,084
Think that this life...

979
00:59:10,084 --> 00:59:11,501
...is only a road.

980
00:59:11,876 --> 00:59:13,709
Withstand your pain...

981
00:59:14,001 --> 00:59:16,251
...and prepare your soul
for the joy...

982
00:59:16,251 --> 00:59:18,209
...of being in god's presence.

983
00:59:19,542 --> 00:59:20,584
Not heaven.

984
00:59:21,751 --> 00:59:22,376
Juan.

985
00:59:22,917 --> 00:59:25,126
Leave the passions
of this world behind, child.

986
00:59:25,667 --> 00:59:27,167
The lord has given you time...

987
00:59:27,167 --> 00:59:29,167
...to examine your conscience.

988
00:59:29,501 --> 00:59:31,459
Think of heaven that awaits you.

989
00:59:32,626 --> 00:59:34,042
Not heaven.

990
00:59:36,709 --> 00:59:38,292
As a priest I tell you...

991
00:59:38,501 --> 00:59:41,626
...that you can save
yourself if you repent.

992
00:59:43,167 --> 00:59:44,834
Juan.

993
01:00:04,292 --> 01:00:06,084
We've come to help.

994
01:00:10,001 --> 01:00:10,834
Lucia.

995
01:00:12,042 --> 01:00:13,667
Lucia, it's me.

996
01:00:14,209 --> 01:00:15,376
I am here again.

997
01:00:15,959 --> 01:00:17,376
I won't leave anymore.

998
01:00:17,959 --> 01:00:19,876
Help is here,
they will cure you.

999
01:00:20,084 --> 01:00:21,626
Soon you will be fine.

1000
01:00:23,376 --> 01:00:24,584
You can go now.

1001
01:00:25,376 --> 01:00:27,667
- You are no longer needed.
- I'm a priest.

1002
01:00:27,834 --> 01:00:30,667
I beg you to let me help
you through these times.

1003
01:00:31,084 --> 01:00:32,334
Juan.

1004
01:00:33,459 --> 01:00:35,334
Tell them to go away.

1005
01:00:37,001 --> 01:00:38,042
Didn't you hear?

1006
01:00:38,042 --> 01:00:39,626
They must go!

1007
01:01:08,959 --> 01:01:10,667
I have failed, child.

1008
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:14,126
May the lord have
pity on the soul.

1009
01:01:15,501 --> 01:01:17,917
I wanted that, too.

1010
01:02:20,126 --> 01:02:22,417
There is nothing
for us to do here.

1011
01:02:30,917 --> 01:02:32,834
Look at what a delicious avocado.

1012
01:02:32,834 --> 01:02:34,167
The legs are short.

1013
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:35,834
Let's break the pinata.

1014
01:02:35,834 --> 01:02:37,584
Lower it, I can't reach.

1015
01:02:37,584 --> 01:02:39,584
Now take it, you thieves.

1016
01:02:39,584 --> 01:02:41,751
Whoever touches it will be sorry.

1017
01:02:42,001 --> 01:02:43,751
Mr. Saban.

1018
01:02:44,209 --> 01:02:45,751
They want to rob and kill me.

1019
01:02:45,751 --> 01:02:47,292
Mr. Saban.

1020
01:02:51,042 --> 01:02:52,626
Don't let them, Ujo.

1021
01:02:52,876 --> 01:02:54,292
Don't let them.

1022
01:02:56,917 --> 01:02:57,751
Thank you.

1023
01:02:57,751 --> 01:02:59,501
Thank you, Mr. Saban.

1024
01:03:03,001 --> 01:03:04,667
Charitable souls...

1025
01:03:05,084 --> 01:03:07,001
won't you give me something?

1026
01:03:12,834 --> 01:03:14,334
What a stingy old woman.

1027
01:03:14,334 --> 01:03:15,876
She won't give a glass of water.

1028
01:03:15,876 --> 01:03:18,542
I'll mark the best
doors for you, Andara.

1029
01:03:18,834 --> 01:03:21,084
But I don't want to
trouble you, shorty.

1030
01:03:21,084 --> 01:03:22,834
No trouble.

1031
01:03:22,834 --> 01:03:24,792
I am fond of you, Andara.

1032
01:03:24,917 --> 01:03:26,501
This is...

1033
01:03:26,751 --> 01:03:28,876
- what did you bring?
- Lots of stuff.

1034
01:03:28,876 --> 01:03:31,084
I have more at home.
Do you want to go over?

1035
01:03:31,334 --> 01:03:34,376
Let's sit in the street
to avoid gossip.

1036
01:03:34,376 --> 01:03:36,334
Would you like me to carry you?

1037
01:03:38,251 --> 01:03:39,584
You're ugly.

1038
01:03:39,584 --> 01:03:41,834
Ugly, but I’m fond of you, Andara.

1039
01:03:42,001 --> 01:03:44,709
Since I saw you at the
church yesterday.

1040
01:03:44,709 --> 01:03:46,001
Nobody loves...

1041
01:03:46,001 --> 01:03:47,709
...that ugly woman.

1042
01:03:47,834 --> 01:03:49,459
She must be for me.

1043
01:03:49,584 --> 01:03:50,667
So, if you...

1044
01:03:50,917 --> 01:03:53,001
do you think you're pretty?

1045
01:03:53,001 --> 01:03:55,084
A legless tadpole.

1046
01:03:55,501 --> 01:03:56,792
That's what you are.

1047
01:03:57,251 --> 01:04:00,167
Say what you will, I am fond
of you and want to help.

1048
01:04:00,167 --> 01:04:02,709
Sit down, we have to talk.

1049
01:04:05,876 --> 01:04:07,167
Good morning.

1050
01:04:07,667 --> 01:04:08,834
I'm going to wash these clothes.

1051
01:04:08,834 --> 01:04:11,334
Wait here, we will go
up the hill together.

1052
01:04:15,751 --> 01:04:17,542
She sure is good-looking.

1053
01:04:17,542 --> 01:04:19,292
She hasn't worked the streets.

1054
01:04:19,292 --> 01:04:21,876
Hey, you repugnant shorty.

1055
01:04:21,876 --> 01:04:23,834
Relax, no insult intended.

1056
01:04:23,834 --> 01:04:26,584
I don't care if you're public,
I want you at my side.

1057
01:04:26,876 --> 01:04:27,667
But listen.

1058
01:04:27,834 --> 01:04:30,334
You should beat it,
get out of town.

1059
01:04:30,584 --> 01:04:31,751
What, Ujo?

1060
01:04:31,751 --> 01:04:32,584
Pinto...

1061
01:04:32,709 --> 01:04:35,959
Mr. Sabas' cousin,
is spreading stuff about you.

1062
01:04:36,251 --> 01:04:37,959
Pinto is here?

1063
01:04:38,126 --> 01:04:39,751
He came to buy some horses.

1064
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:43,042
He said the feds are after you,
you're criminals.

1065
01:04:53,459 --> 01:04:55,501
I tell you he's seven years old.

1066
01:04:55,626 --> 01:04:57,542
I don't want him, he's eight.

1067
01:04:57,542 --> 01:04:58,667
No he's not.

1068
01:04:58,792 --> 01:05:00,209
I'm not deceiving you, pinto.

1069
01:05:00,209 --> 01:05:01,417
I saw when he was born.

1070
01:05:01,417 --> 01:05:03,417
He's gentle, does no tricks.

1071
01:05:03,417 --> 01:05:05,084
Try him out.

1072
01:05:45,126 --> 01:05:47,376
I knew you were around here.

1073
01:05:47,459 --> 01:05:48,626
Garbage.

1074
01:05:48,792 --> 01:05:50,834
A priest's lover, no doubt.

1075
01:05:51,001 --> 01:05:53,709
You brag about being
a pilgrim apostle.

1076
01:05:53,709 --> 01:05:56,042
But I know you,
I know what you are.

1077
01:05:56,042 --> 01:05:58,001
You big hussy.

1078
01:06:00,792 --> 01:06:01,959
Wait.

1079
01:06:05,251 --> 01:06:08,084
Even if it's just courtesy,
listen to me.

1080
01:06:08,334 --> 01:06:10,376
Had you forgotten me?

1081
01:06:13,959 --> 01:06:15,417
I hadn't forgotten you, either.

1082
01:06:15,501 --> 01:06:17,334
Although you're not worth it.

1083
01:06:17,459 --> 01:06:20,084
I saw you with
that sanctimonious bum.

1084
01:06:20,376 --> 01:06:22,042
I want you to leave him.

1085
01:06:22,042 --> 01:06:23,001
You hear?

1086
01:06:23,292 --> 01:06:26,001
He's good, I will not leave him.

1087
01:06:26,001 --> 01:06:27,001
Now you know.

1088
01:06:27,001 --> 01:06:29,501
Remember I have a bad temper.

1089
01:06:29,834 --> 01:06:32,042
Tomorrow at eleven
I’m leaving for your town.

1090
01:06:32,042 --> 01:06:33,626
From there, to the capital.

1091
01:06:34,001 --> 01:06:35,626
You're coming with me.

1092
01:06:36,501 --> 01:06:37,626
I'm thirsty.

1093
01:06:38,542 --> 01:06:39,792
Give me some water.

1094
01:06:50,334 --> 01:06:51,459
Now, come.

1095
01:06:52,084 --> 01:06:54,376
Come where we can talk.

1096
01:07:02,459 --> 01:07:04,751
Leave me alone pinto,
for the love of god.

1097
01:07:04,959 --> 01:07:07,626
If it's an order I’ll go,
but I don't want to.

1098
01:07:07,834 --> 01:07:09,334
I want to be good.

1099
01:07:09,334 --> 01:07:11,459
Let me be good, pinto.

1100
01:07:13,834 --> 01:07:15,126
Stop pinto, I won't go.

1101
01:07:15,126 --> 01:07:16,001
I won't.

1102
01:07:18,334 --> 01:07:19,834
All right, woman.

1103
01:07:19,834 --> 01:07:21,084
Tomorrow, then.

1104
01:07:21,167 --> 01:07:23,626
I'll wait for you
at the town exit.

1105
01:07:24,042 --> 01:07:25,501
You're advised.

1106
01:07:25,501 --> 01:07:27,459
Don't fail me, or else...

1107
01:07:27,709 --> 01:07:29,459
oh, get out.

1108
01:07:29,626 --> 01:07:31,459
Get out!

1109
01:07:41,459 --> 01:07:44,334
Because night carries
yesterday's sorrow...

1110
01:07:44,334 --> 01:07:47,376
...and the hope and joy
of a new day.

1111
01:07:47,834 --> 01:07:49,167
That's what death is like.

1112
01:07:49,626 --> 01:07:51,167
Joyous and sorrowful.

1113
01:07:51,542 --> 01:07:54,834
Joyous because it frees
us of life's chains.

1114
01:07:54,834 --> 01:07:56,084
And sorrowful...

1115
01:07:56,084 --> 01:07:58,001
...because we love our flesh...

1116
01:07:58,001 --> 01:08:00,126
...and it hurts us to leave it.

1117
01:08:05,959 --> 01:08:07,959
What's wrong, Beatriz?

1118
01:08:13,334 --> 01:08:15,001
You had a bad encounter.

1119
01:08:15,001 --> 01:08:16,501
Didn't you, child?

1120
01:08:16,834 --> 01:08:18,542
Did you see us, father?

1121
01:08:20,292 --> 01:08:22,751
Then, how can you guess?

1122
01:08:22,959 --> 01:08:24,501
That's not guessing.

1123
01:08:24,709 --> 01:08:25,751
It's knowing.

1124
01:08:33,709 --> 01:08:35,501
You are always the most pious.

1125
01:08:35,834 --> 01:08:38,209
Today you were distracted
at prayer.

1126
01:08:38,209 --> 01:08:39,709
Distant.

1127
01:08:40,667 --> 01:08:44,126
The squalls of passion
are difficult to hide.

1128
01:08:44,667 --> 01:08:47,501
I know you're struggling
against Satan.

1129
01:08:49,584 --> 01:08:52,251
When he looks at me, I obey.

1130
01:08:52,751 --> 01:08:54,667
I was about to go with him.

1131
01:08:54,959 --> 01:08:56,584
And I don't want to, father.

1132
01:08:57,542 --> 01:08:59,501
Can you explain that?

1133
01:08:59,667 --> 01:09:01,209
It's a bad passion, child.

1134
01:09:01,334 --> 01:09:04,042
Mortal flesh avoids domination.

1135
01:09:05,042 --> 01:09:07,709
What can I do to kill
that weed, father?

1136
01:09:07,709 --> 01:09:08,501
Love.

1137
01:09:08,834 --> 01:09:10,167
And not only one thing...

1138
01:09:10,167 --> 01:09:11,709
...or one single human being.

1139
01:09:11,876 --> 01:09:13,709
But all of god's creation.

1140
01:09:14,376 --> 01:09:16,251
Is that how you love, father?

1141
01:09:16,792 --> 01:09:18,626
Is that how you love Andara...

1142
01:09:18,626 --> 01:09:19,542
...and I?

1143
01:09:19,542 --> 01:09:21,001
Yes, like that.

1144
01:09:21,917 --> 01:09:23,292
God knows...

1145
01:09:23,292 --> 01:09:25,042
...how can we flee, father?

1146
01:09:25,209 --> 01:09:26,959
Climbing down the hill...

1147
01:09:26,959 --> 01:09:28,876
...nobody will see or hear us.

1148
01:09:30,251 --> 01:09:31,209
Flee?

1149
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:33,042
Thieves flee.

1150
01:09:33,042 --> 01:09:36,042
Not those who give
everything to people in need.

1151
01:09:37,251 --> 01:09:39,584
I know that due to our
humble condition...

1152
01:09:39,792 --> 01:09:42,667
...human justice will
not care for us.

1153
01:09:43,501 --> 01:09:44,709
But the divine...

1154
01:09:45,417 --> 01:09:47,626
...will not forsake us.

1155
01:10:02,792 --> 01:10:06,167
A while ago I got a
bad feeling in my head.

1156
01:10:07,084 --> 01:10:08,792
A premonition?

1157
01:10:10,167 --> 01:10:11,501
Oh, father.

1158
01:10:12,417 --> 01:10:14,751
I think we're going
to have hard times.

1159
01:10:16,209 --> 01:10:17,667
I think so, too.

1160
01:10:18,667 --> 01:10:19,626
We will suffer much.

1161
01:10:21,167 --> 01:10:24,334
When that happens, I only
hope I am at your side.

1162
01:10:24,834 --> 01:10:27,459
If I can carry your load
on my back...

1163
01:10:27,751 --> 01:10:29,334
...I certainly would, because...

1164
01:10:29,501 --> 01:10:31,334
...that's how much I trust you.

1165
01:10:31,709 --> 01:10:33,334
I am fond of you, too.

1166
01:10:34,126 --> 01:10:35,917
If you should get lost like sheep...

1167
01:10:35,917 --> 01:10:37,126
...I would search for you.

1168
01:10:37,792 --> 01:10:39,667
Promise me whatever happens...

1169
01:10:39,667 --> 01:10:41,417
...you won't make me leave your side.

1170
01:10:44,626 --> 01:10:46,917
I am very tired, father.

1171
01:11:00,626 --> 01:11:02,001
What is it, Andara?

1172
01:11:03,917 --> 01:11:05,042
What's wrong?

1173
01:11:07,667 --> 01:11:08,667
Come here.

1174
01:11:09,792 --> 01:11:10,667
Come.

1175
01:11:17,126 --> 01:11:18,126
Sit down.

1176
01:11:20,667 --> 01:11:22,251
Tell me what it is.

1177
01:11:23,251 --> 01:11:25,417
She has her pride...

1178
01:11:25,417 --> 01:11:28,001
...and doesn't like a
"nobody" offending her.

1179
01:11:28,001 --> 01:11:29,292
And you...

1180
01:11:29,417 --> 01:11:31,209
you love Beatriz more.

1181
01:11:31,209 --> 01:11:32,501
And it isn't fair.

1182
01:11:32,667 --> 01:11:33,751
I love you two the same.

1183
01:11:33,751 --> 01:11:35,334
No, sir.

1184
01:11:35,334 --> 01:11:37,792
You say nice things
to Beatriz...

1185
01:11:37,792 --> 01:11:38,792
...and to me...

1186
01:11:38,959 --> 01:11:40,959
...since I am such a dunce...

1187
01:11:41,167 --> 01:11:43,334
you just call me a fool.

1188
01:11:43,334 --> 01:11:45,334
Don't say that, child.

1189
01:11:45,501 --> 01:11:46,959
I love you both the same.

1190
01:11:48,334 --> 01:11:50,459
And stop thinking those things.

1191
01:12:16,167 --> 01:12:19,251
- Andara.
- Ujo, a tamale.

1192
01:12:21,167 --> 01:12:22,792
Your body fell off today.

1193
01:12:23,001 --> 01:12:24,876
You've only brought your head.

1194
01:12:25,126 --> 01:12:27,501
I came to tell you
that I am going with you.

1195
01:12:27,501 --> 01:12:28,751
Because I care for you.

1196
01:12:28,751 --> 01:12:30,167
Because you have robbed...

1197
01:12:30,167 --> 01:12:33,001
...my heart and put it
in my mouth, honey pie.

1198
01:12:33,167 --> 01:12:34,084
Beatriz...

1199
01:12:34,084 --> 01:12:35,667
...Ujo is coming with us.

1200
01:12:35,667 --> 01:12:37,042
He says he cares for me.

1201
01:12:37,042 --> 01:12:39,459
Love is the prettiest thing.

1202
01:12:40,001 --> 01:12:41,584
Do you truly love her, Ujo?

1203
01:12:41,667 --> 01:12:43,001
Yes, I do.

1204
01:12:43,876 --> 01:12:44,959
You, ugly.

1205
01:12:45,417 --> 01:12:46,626
You, public.

1206
01:12:47,292 --> 01:12:49,251
I had never cared for anyone.

1207
01:12:49,501 --> 01:12:51,334
But as soon as I saw you...

1208
01:12:51,626 --> 01:12:53,209
what a love.

1209
01:12:53,959 --> 01:12:54,917
See?

1210
01:12:54,917 --> 01:12:56,459
He is my sweetheart.

1211
01:12:58,959 --> 01:13:00,459
There they are.

1212
01:13:24,834 --> 01:13:26,001
We caught them together.

1213
01:13:26,001 --> 01:13:28,376
Ujo, you'll lose your girl.

1214
01:13:30,667 --> 01:13:32,001
Who are you looking for?

1215
01:13:32,334 --> 01:13:34,667
You, a hussy and a renegade.

1216
01:13:34,709 --> 01:13:37,167
Stop teaching bad habits.

1217
01:13:37,167 --> 01:13:38,667
If you've come to arrest us...

1218
01:13:38,667 --> 01:13:40,292
...we will not resist.

1219
01:13:41,084 --> 01:13:42,876
No need for such an upheaval...

1220
01:13:42,876 --> 01:13:44,834
...to catch 3 harmless people.

1221
01:13:45,001 --> 01:13:47,376
It's against you, and a certain...

1222
01:13:47,376 --> 01:13:49,542
...Ana de Ara, I have a
warrant for your arrest.

1223
01:13:53,167 --> 01:13:54,501
Let's go.

1224
01:14:00,626 --> 01:14:02,167
One woman is not enough.

1225
01:14:02,167 --> 01:14:03,251
Now you have two.

1226
01:14:03,376 --> 01:14:04,792
We are christian.

1227
01:14:04,792 --> 01:14:05,792
Bully.

1228
01:14:06,542 --> 01:14:08,042
Coward, you wretch.

1229
01:14:08,042 --> 01:14:09,709
Don't you see he has no defense?

1230
01:14:09,709 --> 01:14:10,584
Grab her.

1231
01:14:10,584 --> 01:14:12,001
Here, make more fire.

1232
01:14:12,001 --> 01:14:12,917
Stronger.

1233
01:14:12,917 --> 01:14:14,167
Beat him.

1234
01:14:14,792 --> 01:14:16,126
Let me go.

1235
01:14:16,126 --> 01:14:17,292
You've beaten my sweetheart.

1236
01:14:17,292 --> 01:14:18,001
Sure.

1237
01:14:18,001 --> 01:14:20,876
- Did they hurt you, father?
- It doesn't matter.

1238
01:14:21,084 --> 01:14:23,126
Let me go, stop it.

1239
01:14:23,126 --> 01:14:24,042
Andara.

1240
01:14:24,042 --> 01:14:25,459
I said let go.

1241
01:14:25,584 --> 01:14:26,376
You see.

1242
01:14:26,501 --> 01:14:27,167
You see.

1243
01:14:27,167 --> 01:14:28,709
Because you didn't obey me.

1244
01:14:28,709 --> 01:14:30,667
Get out of here, you dirty frog.

1245
01:14:32,292 --> 01:14:33,459
Calm down, Andara.

1246
01:14:33,459 --> 01:14:34,542
You have done wrong.

1247
01:14:34,667 --> 01:14:37,292
Apologize to your victim
for god's forgiveness.

1248
01:14:39,501 --> 01:14:41,834
Scumbag, sorry, damn it.

1249
01:14:41,834 --> 01:14:43,292
Come on, let's go.

1250
01:14:44,667 --> 01:14:46,167
Stay here, Beatriz.

1251
01:14:46,417 --> 01:14:48,167
They only want us.

1252
01:15:08,001 --> 01:15:09,084
Careful.

1253
01:15:10,251 --> 01:15:11,417
Sergeant.

1254
01:15:11,417 --> 01:15:13,334
Don't you remember me?

1255
01:15:14,334 --> 01:15:15,334
Yes.

1256
01:15:15,334 --> 01:15:16,667
From your village.

1257
01:15:16,667 --> 01:15:18,042
What will they do to us?

1258
01:15:18,167 --> 01:15:20,501
Soon, in a moment, a rope
of prisoners...

1259
01:15:20,501 --> 01:15:22,626
...will parade down
your own village.

1260
01:15:22,834 --> 01:15:25,167
- You'd better go alone.
- Sergeant.

1261
01:15:25,167 --> 01:15:27,167
Let father nazario escape.

1262
01:15:27,167 --> 01:15:28,834
You should be ashamed of yourself.

1263
01:15:28,834 --> 01:15:31,459
He's done nothing,
I swear he's a saint.

1264
01:15:35,542 --> 01:15:36,626
Andara.

1265
01:15:38,042 --> 01:15:40,001
Ujo.

1266
01:15:40,417 --> 01:15:42,167
You behaved very poorly.

1267
01:15:42,334 --> 01:15:44,167
You sure kicked me there.

1268
01:15:44,251 --> 01:15:45,501
But, in spite of your cruelty...

1269
01:15:45,501 --> 01:15:47,167
...I care for you.
That's why I’m here.

1270
01:15:47,167 --> 01:15:49,126
I kicked you?

1271
01:15:49,584 --> 01:15:52,626
Forgive me, shorty,
I care for you too.

1272
01:15:52,917 --> 01:15:55,501
I got carried away
and didn't see what I was doing.

1273
01:15:55,501 --> 01:15:57,626
When you hit the
man with the pole...

1274
01:15:57,626 --> 01:16:00,167
I couldn't believe it was you.

1275
01:16:00,167 --> 01:16:02,959
You were spitting fire,
but you looked pretty to me.

1276
01:16:03,167 --> 01:16:05,001
You are so ugly...

1277
01:16:05,001 --> 01:16:06,959
...but you looked pretty.

1278
01:16:08,126 --> 01:16:09,959
Look, my little snail.

1279
01:16:09,959 --> 01:16:11,042
Get down, midget.

1280
01:16:11,042 --> 01:16:15,876
Let me go, let me go.

1281
01:16:27,001 --> 01:16:28,792
Get some rest.

1282
01:16:37,001 --> 01:16:38,417
Here, for the girls.

1283
01:16:38,417 --> 01:16:39,709
What about me?

1284
01:16:39,917 --> 01:16:41,709
There is nothing for the men.

1285
01:16:43,209 --> 01:16:44,584
Listen, corporal.

1286
01:16:44,834 --> 01:16:47,709
Untie our hands for a while.

1287
01:16:48,126 --> 01:16:50,542
Let's see, give us some
water, we're dry.

1288
01:16:50,542 --> 01:16:52,084
Do you have a cigarette?

1289
01:16:52,334 --> 01:16:54,251
A cigarette, please.

1290
01:16:54,501 --> 01:16:55,834
Let me have one, come on...

1291
01:16:55,834 --> 01:16:57,084
whoever catches it first.

1292
01:16:57,084 --> 01:16:59,459
Quiet, there's enough for all.

1293
01:17:01,834 --> 01:17:02,667
Here.

1294
01:17:06,751 --> 01:17:08,334
- Stay still.
- Water.

1295
01:17:08,667 --> 01:17:09,876
Water.

1296
01:17:28,917 --> 01:17:30,917
You have it in there.

1297
01:17:43,834 --> 01:17:45,334
You dunce, now do you see why...

1298
01:17:45,334 --> 01:17:47,334
...I told you to come with me?

1299
01:17:47,917 --> 01:17:49,584
Don't make that face.

1300
01:17:49,876 --> 01:17:51,501
I have a horse outside.

1301
01:17:51,501 --> 01:17:52,834
Hurry, we're leaving.

1302
01:17:52,834 --> 01:17:54,959
- Where to?
- Wherever I decide.

1303
01:17:55,042 --> 01:17:57,334
Be grateful I even
searched for you.

1304
01:17:57,876 --> 01:17:59,376
What are you waiting for?

1305
01:18:01,751 --> 01:18:03,501
Where are you going?

1306
01:18:03,626 --> 01:18:06,334
I'm not going with you,
I’m staying.

1307
01:18:06,334 --> 01:18:08,709
Listen, don't try my patience.

1308
01:18:08,917 --> 01:18:10,834
I won't leave him, kill me.

1309
01:18:11,459 --> 01:18:12,959
If he's insulted, so am I.

1310
01:18:13,167 --> 01:18:15,084
If he's hungry, so am I.

1311
01:18:15,167 --> 01:18:17,959
If they hurt him,
I hope I get beat, too.

1312
01:18:18,042 --> 01:18:20,167
If I can't be in jail with him...

1313
01:18:20,167 --> 01:18:22,709
...I'll wait at the gate
until that saint gets out.

1314
01:18:22,959 --> 01:18:25,751
I'm going to kick that
devotion out of you.

1315
01:18:26,167 --> 01:18:27,584
I will be in your town tonight.

1316
01:18:27,584 --> 01:18:29,001
I'll talk to your mother.

1317
01:18:29,251 --> 01:18:31,876
If she can't talk you
into going with me...

1318
01:18:32,042 --> 01:18:33,501
you will be sorry.

1319
01:18:41,542 --> 01:18:42,876
Well, let's go.

1320
01:18:46,917 --> 01:18:47,751
All right.

1321
01:18:48,084 --> 01:18:49,251
See you there.

1322
01:18:49,667 --> 01:18:50,917
She is stubborn.

1323
01:18:50,917 --> 01:18:52,876
Leave her to me.

1324
01:19:02,751 --> 01:19:03,876
Everybody ready?

1325
01:19:03,876 --> 01:19:05,834
Come on, what's the hurry?

1326
01:19:05,834 --> 01:19:07,709
Stop complaining, it's useless.

1327
01:19:07,709 --> 01:19:09,542
Shut your mouth.

1328
01:19:09,542 --> 01:19:10,334
Andara.

1329
01:19:11,001 --> 01:19:14,001
I thought you didn't
want to say good-bye.

1330
01:19:14,251 --> 01:19:16,001
Hurray for the couple.

1331
01:19:17,167 --> 01:19:18,417
What are you laughing at?

1332
01:19:18,501 --> 01:19:20,917
You are making do with
so little, doll.

1333
01:19:21,417 --> 01:19:22,792
Go ahead, laugh.

1334
01:19:22,792 --> 01:19:24,292
I care for you, Andara.

1335
01:19:31,292 --> 01:19:32,209
Forward.

1336
01:19:32,209 --> 01:19:33,126
March.

1337
01:19:33,709 --> 01:19:35,001
Come on, out.

1338
01:19:37,501 --> 01:19:39,084
Good-bye, Ujo.

1339
01:19:46,501 --> 01:19:47,626
Good-bye.

1340
01:19:48,584 --> 01:19:50,376
Good-bye, Ujo.

1341
01:19:53,417 --> 01:19:55,584
Good-bye, shorty.

1342
01:20:20,959 --> 01:20:22,501
Sergeant.

1343
01:20:30,209 --> 01:20:32,501
Somebody take this girl.

1344
01:20:32,667 --> 01:20:34,501
Let's see, the priest.

1345
01:20:42,042 --> 01:20:43,001
Go on.

1346
01:20:43,167 --> 01:20:45,001
Let's go!

1347
01:20:51,292 --> 01:20:53,292
Why are you taking her so?

1348
01:20:53,501 --> 01:20:55,292
The old man is her grandfather.

1349
01:20:55,459 --> 01:20:57,709
The sergeant says he kidnapped her.

1350
01:20:57,959 --> 01:20:59,751
They are going to drop her off.

1351
01:20:59,751 --> 01:21:00,667
Hey.

1352
01:21:01,459 --> 01:21:05,584
If you're a priest, hear their
confession so we know their sins.

1353
01:21:06,876 --> 01:21:08,876
Hear your mother's confession!

1354
01:21:09,584 --> 01:21:10,667
Sergeant.

1355
01:21:10,792 --> 01:21:13,376
This woman is disrespecting me!

1356
01:21:17,126 --> 01:21:20,084
Hand me the newest one,
naughty priest.

1357
01:21:27,834 --> 01:21:28,792
Sergeant.

1358
01:21:28,792 --> 01:21:32,292
Aren't you sick to see
him treated that way?

1359
01:21:37,167 --> 01:21:39,584
Hand some over, you're tired.

1360
01:21:39,584 --> 01:21:42,084
Come on, man.
Give us a little taste.

1361
01:21:42,959 --> 01:21:46,376
Save some for the poor.

1362
01:21:53,501 --> 01:21:55,167
That's enough rudeness.

1363
01:21:55,334 --> 01:21:56,959
You will be quiet.

1364
01:21:57,084 --> 01:21:58,126
Get up.

1365
01:21:59,251 --> 01:22:00,667
Forward... march.

1366
01:22:04,709 --> 01:22:06,501
We'll meet later.

1367
01:22:06,501 --> 01:22:09,126
What will you get
for being so stingy?

1368
01:22:22,959 --> 01:22:24,001
Go on inside.

1369
01:22:24,001 --> 01:22:25,376
Women over here.

1370
01:22:39,959 --> 01:22:41,584
Don't cry, mother.

1371
01:22:41,917 --> 01:22:44,001
How? You're a prisoner.

1372
01:22:44,001 --> 01:22:45,376
I am not a prisoner.

1373
01:22:45,376 --> 01:22:46,917
I chose to be here.

1374
01:22:46,917 --> 01:22:48,959
They have nothing against me.

1375
01:22:49,167 --> 01:22:51,251
What about the shame of...

1376
01:22:51,251 --> 01:22:53,542
...seeing you parade
with criminals?

1377
01:22:53,709 --> 01:22:55,834
We were always honest people.

1378
01:22:56,167 --> 01:22:58,501
Death is better
than seeing this.

1379
01:22:58,792 --> 01:23:01,042
Humiliation is good
for the soul.

1380
01:23:01,542 --> 01:23:03,001
What are you talking about?

1381
01:23:03,501 --> 01:23:05,709
That is what the priest says.

1382
01:23:06,834 --> 01:23:08,167
Forgive me, honey...

1383
01:23:08,167 --> 01:23:10,792
...but a priest who
travels with women...

1384
01:23:11,001 --> 01:23:12,876
...is no saint.

1385
01:23:13,542 --> 01:23:14,876
Well, yes he is.

1386
01:23:15,167 --> 01:23:17,001
You should have seen him.

1387
01:23:19,001 --> 01:23:21,876
He cured the girl
just by touching her.

1388
01:23:22,292 --> 01:23:24,126
And those who had the plague.

1389
01:23:24,126 --> 01:23:26,667
He lead them to heaven.

1390
01:23:27,792 --> 01:23:29,917
How else could it be?

1391
01:23:30,459 --> 01:23:33,709
His angelical voice
dives into your bones.

1392
01:23:35,126 --> 01:23:36,667
If he touches your clothes...

1393
01:23:36,959 --> 01:23:39,126
...you start shaking
as if you wanted to die...

1394
01:23:39,626 --> 01:23:42,834
...and go to heaven
to be with him forever.

1395
01:23:48,667 --> 01:23:50,126
Oh, darling.

1396
01:23:50,334 --> 01:23:52,084
You love that man.

1397
01:23:52,667 --> 01:23:54,584
You love him like a man.

1398
01:24:01,376 --> 01:24:03,042
Liar!

1399
01:24:06,751 --> 01:24:08,292
It's a lie!

1400
01:24:11,417 --> 01:24:13,001
- Oh, no.
- Pinto!

1401
01:24:13,167 --> 01:24:15,001
Take her away, she's ill.

1402
01:24:15,001 --> 01:24:16,084
I'm dying.

1403
01:24:16,084 --> 01:24:18,751
No, don't see.

1404
01:24:18,751 --> 01:24:21,709
Lie, it's a lie.

1405
01:24:27,709 --> 01:24:30,126
You are worse than a dog.

1406
01:24:30,167 --> 01:24:33,167
Oh, I am so ashamed
I could die.

1407
01:24:33,167 --> 01:24:35,417
I'm dying.

1408
01:24:35,501 --> 01:24:37,167
Don't believe it, father.

1409
01:24:37,167 --> 01:24:40,334
It isn't true,
don't believe it.

1410
01:24:40,334 --> 01:24:41,959
Don't believe it.

1411
01:24:56,542 --> 01:24:59,334
I said we'd meet later.

1412
01:24:59,334 --> 01:25:01,917
Come, I’ll teach you
another rosary.

1413
01:25:01,917 --> 01:25:04,292
Punch his mouth so
he preaches better.

1414
01:25:04,292 --> 01:25:05,501
Hey you, what's worse?

1415
01:25:05,501 --> 01:25:07,459
Being a whore or a madame?

1416
01:25:07,459 --> 01:25:09,959
He can say what he pleases.

1417
01:25:10,834 --> 01:25:12,709
And he will say it here.

1418
01:25:12,709 --> 01:25:15,167
Father, give some holy bread.

1419
01:25:15,167 --> 01:25:17,001
Go on, give your communion.

1420
01:25:17,001 --> 01:25:18,459
You scoundrels.

1421
01:25:18,792 --> 01:25:19,917
You're blind.

1422
01:25:20,459 --> 01:25:23,334
Insult me, not the
sanctity of mass.

1423
01:25:23,709 --> 01:25:25,001
Cowards.

1424
01:25:25,501 --> 01:25:28,292
Abuse your strength, but don't
offend the majesty...

1425
01:25:28,459 --> 01:25:29,501
...of the lord, your creator.

1426
01:25:29,501 --> 01:25:31,584
We'll see who's a coward.

1427
01:25:31,751 --> 01:25:32,501
You wimp.

1428
01:25:32,667 --> 01:25:34,792
Go on, give him his communion.

1429
01:25:37,917 --> 01:25:41,376
I thought the priest could
fight, but he's chicken.

1430
01:25:49,501 --> 01:25:51,334
For the first time in my life...

1431
01:25:51,626 --> 01:25:53,501
...it's hard for me to forgive.

1432
01:25:56,667 --> 01:25:59,751
And I forgive you,
it is my christian duty.

1433
01:26:01,001 --> 01:26:02,334
I forgive you.

1434
01:26:04,501 --> 01:26:06,709
But I also scorn you.

1435
01:26:06,959 --> 01:26:09,667
And I feel guilty about
not knowing how...

1436
01:26:09,667 --> 01:26:11,042
...to separate scorn...

1437
01:26:11,834 --> 01:26:12,959
...from forgiveness.

1438
01:26:14,209 --> 01:26:16,334
Keep your forgiveness.

1439
01:26:18,501 --> 01:26:20,626
Now, a little stroll.

1440
01:26:25,334 --> 01:26:28,334
He'll need bandages
for Sunday mass.

1441
01:26:35,209 --> 01:26:36,292
Stop.

1442
01:26:36,292 --> 01:26:37,626
He's not defending himself.

1443
01:26:37,626 --> 01:26:38,834
Who asked you?

1444
01:26:38,834 --> 01:26:41,626
It's not manly to
beat someone that way.

1445
01:26:42,792 --> 01:26:44,792
What, did you get cold feet?

1446
01:26:48,084 --> 01:26:49,459
Who didn't like it?

1447
01:26:49,459 --> 01:26:51,417
Let's stop here.

1448
01:27:07,334 --> 01:27:08,251
Thank you.

1449
01:27:09,792 --> 01:27:10,834
Thank you.

1450
01:27:12,417 --> 01:27:13,667
You are good.

1451
01:27:14,292 --> 01:27:15,667
Me, good?

1452
01:27:16,126 --> 01:27:18,292
No, I’m quite the opposite.

1453
01:27:25,834 --> 01:27:27,834
Have you committed many crimes?

1454
01:27:30,084 --> 01:27:31,334
I don't know.

1455
01:27:32,376 --> 01:27:33,834
Only two.

1456
01:27:34,709 --> 01:27:37,292
And burglarized many churches.

1457
01:27:38,501 --> 01:27:40,376
Don't you felt pain sometimes...

1458
01:27:40,667 --> 01:27:42,376
...about what you did?

1459
01:27:43,542 --> 01:27:45,292
When I’m alone.

1460
01:27:46,542 --> 01:27:48,834
But then my friends come, and...

1461
01:27:50,001 --> 01:27:51,376
do you have any relatives?

1462
01:27:52,667 --> 01:27:54,709
I might as well not.

1463
01:27:55,167 --> 01:27:57,001
My mother is in jail.

1464
01:27:57,584 --> 01:27:59,001
Go with god.

1465
01:28:01,251 --> 01:28:02,959
Would you like to be good?

1466
01:28:03,417 --> 01:28:04,459
Yes...

1467
01:28:05,834 --> 01:28:06,876
...but how?

1468
01:28:08,042 --> 01:28:09,709
All you have to do is say:

1469
01:28:09,834 --> 01:28:11,126
"I want to be good".

1470
01:28:12,084 --> 01:28:15,001
And be truly determined
to be good.

1471
01:28:17,209 --> 01:28:19,459
You'd like to change your life.

1472
01:28:21,459 --> 01:28:23,959
Would you like to change yours?

1473
01:28:25,126 --> 01:28:26,251
How?

1474
01:28:29,626 --> 01:28:30,876
Look, all...

1475
01:28:32,209 --> 01:28:34,209
all I do are bad deeds.

1476
01:28:35,001 --> 01:28:35,626
And...

1477
01:28:36,792 --> 01:28:38,626
...what good is your life?

1478
01:28:39,417 --> 01:28:42,626
You, on the good side,
and me on the bad side.

1479
01:28:43,334 --> 01:28:45,959
Neither of us are
much good at all.

1480
01:28:50,959 --> 01:28:52,376
Do you have any money?

1481
01:28:54,042 --> 01:28:55,834
I'll keep it for myself.

1482
01:28:56,709 --> 01:28:58,209
You don't need it.

1483
01:29:19,001 --> 01:29:20,376
Attention.

1484
01:29:20,834 --> 01:29:24,292
Get your things, we're
leaving in five minutes.

1485
01:29:25,501 --> 01:29:27,126
Line up outside.

1486
01:29:29,876 --> 01:29:31,001
Sergeant.

1487
01:29:32,126 --> 01:29:33,584
Where is father nazario?

1488
01:29:33,917 --> 01:29:35,584
Isn't he coming with us?

1489
01:29:37,959 --> 01:29:39,209
Where is he?

1490
01:29:43,126 --> 01:29:47,209
The bishop, made an agreement
with civil authorities.

1491
01:29:47,417 --> 01:29:49,209
You will not be on the rope.

1492
01:29:49,417 --> 01:29:50,751
You'll be taken separately.

1493
01:29:50,751 --> 01:29:53,167
Alone, by a man out of uniform.

1494
01:29:53,792 --> 01:29:55,667
That was all they could do.

1495
01:29:55,667 --> 01:29:58,001
No doubt it will spare shame.

1496
01:30:00,126 --> 01:30:03,126
Don't you want to know
the status of your case?

1497
01:30:04,209 --> 01:30:06,792
At least you'll admit
to your recklessness.

1498
01:30:06,959 --> 01:30:08,792
All your madness.

1499
01:30:10,501 --> 01:30:13,251
No wonder they say you
are unresigned.

1500
01:30:13,251 --> 01:30:15,209
A rebel spirit.

1501
01:30:16,709 --> 01:30:19,876
It will be difficult
to adjust to reality.

1502
01:30:21,167 --> 01:30:25,417
To make you see that your habits
contradict those of priests.

1503
01:30:25,417 --> 01:30:27,084
Your ways confront the church...

1504
01:30:27,084 --> 01:30:29,334
...which you claim
to love and obey

1505
01:30:33,501 --> 01:30:35,209
do you need anything?

1506
01:30:50,834 --> 01:30:52,417
Father!

1507
01:30:52,626 --> 01:30:53,501
Father.

1508
01:30:54,126 --> 01:30:56,001
What did they do to you?

1509
01:30:56,667 --> 01:30:58,292
Who hurt you?

1510
01:30:59,251 --> 01:31:01,167
Where are you taking him?

1511
01:31:01,959 --> 01:31:03,042
Good-bye, child.

1512
01:31:03,709 --> 01:31:04,917
Sergeant.

1513
01:31:04,917 --> 01:31:06,459
I want to go where he goes.

1514
01:31:06,459 --> 01:31:07,334
Take them away.

1515
01:31:07,417 --> 01:31:08,917
- Let's go.
- Father!

1516
01:31:08,917 --> 01:31:11,751
No, let me go with him. Father.

1517
01:31:11,751 --> 01:31:13,709
Don't leave me alone, father.

1518
01:31:14,292 --> 01:31:15,459
Father.

1519
01:31:58,501 --> 01:32:01,376
That fat frog-eyes
was the one who beat him.

1520
01:32:01,751 --> 01:32:04,584
And skinny bones
defended him.

1521
01:32:09,084 --> 01:32:12,459
May god bless you
and grant you all graces.

1522
01:32:14,792 --> 01:32:16,292
And to you, frog...

1523
01:32:16,459 --> 01:32:19,251
...may your children rot
before they are born.

1524
01:32:19,251 --> 01:32:21,334
May your throat choke in pus...

1525
01:32:21,334 --> 01:32:25,584
...and may you die
a long, painful death.

1526
01:33:21,501 --> 01:33:23,126
Is he arrested?

1527
01:33:23,292 --> 01:33:24,792
Give me another apple.

1528
01:33:29,251 --> 01:33:31,209
Can I give you something?

1529
01:33:38,334 --> 01:33:41,251
Take this charity,
and may god be with you.

1530
01:33:52,834 --> 01:33:54,167
Take it.

1531
01:33:54,167 --> 01:33:55,876
No.

1532
01:34:04,542 --> 01:34:06,501
May god repay you, ma'am.
