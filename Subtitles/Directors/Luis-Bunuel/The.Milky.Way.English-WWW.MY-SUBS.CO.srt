1
00:00:21,709 --> 00:00:25,876
From the 11th century,
throughout the Middle Ages

2
00:00:26,042 --> 00:00:31,417
the city of Santiago de Compostela
in Spain

3
00:00:31,584 --> 00:00:36,084
was the goal of a great pilgrimage
which still exists today.

4
00:00:36,251 --> 00:00:41,001
Every year, more than 500,000 pilgrims
started out on foot.

5
00:00:41,167 --> 00:00:43,417
They came from all over Europe.

6
00:00:44,917 --> 00:00:49,709
They came to worship
at the tomb of the apostle James.

7
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:56,917
At the end of the 16th century
at the time of the wars of religion,

8
00:00:57,084 --> 00:01:01,417
the Bishop of Santiago
had the remains of the apostle concealed.

9
00:01:02,584 --> 00:01:07,334
They were rediscovered by chance
at the end of the 19th century.

10
00:01:08,126 --> 00:01:12,792
The Papacy hesitated
before authenticating them.

11
00:01:15,501 --> 00:01:19,709
In the 7th century A.D.
- according to legend -

12
00:01:19,876 --> 00:01:24,209
a star led shepherds
to the place where the body was.

13
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:31,209
Hence the name Compostela.
Campus Stellae, the Field of the Star.

14
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:37,667
In the West
the Milky Way is also called

15
00:01:37,834 --> 00:01:40,584
"The Way of St James".

16
00:01:54,459 --> 00:01:58,667
THE MILKY WAY

17
00:04:05,584 --> 00:04:09,251
- Did you think those bastards would stop?
- Forget it.

18
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:14,751
- I'm knackered.
- And I'm hungry.

19
00:04:14,917 --> 00:04:17,542
- Got any bread?
- You know I haven't.

20
00:04:28,042 --> 00:04:29,917
Alms...

21
00:04:30,084 --> 00:04:33,459
Alms, sir...

22
00:04:35,667 --> 00:04:38,459
- Do you have money?
- No, sir.

23
00:04:38,626 --> 00:04:41,501
Then you shall have none.

24
00:04:42,084 --> 00:04:43,751
- And you?
- Me?

25
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:45,292
Yes, I have a little.

26
00:04:46,084 --> 00:04:51,001
Then you shall have much.

27
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:54,584
- Are you going on a pilgrimage?
- Yes, sir.

28
00:04:54,751 --> 00:04:58,209
To Spain? To Santiago de Compostela?

29
00:04:58,376 --> 00:05:00,209
Who told you?

30
00:05:11,792 --> 00:05:15,126
Go, take a whore for a wife.

31
00:05:15,292 --> 00:05:18,084
And bear children of that whore.

32
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:21,542
Name the first: "Ye are not my people"

33
00:05:21,709 --> 00:05:25,667
and the second: "No more mercy".

34
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,292
You understand?

35
00:05:37,376 --> 00:05:38,584
Look!

36
00:05:45,584 --> 00:05:49,959
- Where did he come from?
- Must have been under his cloak.

37
00:05:50,126 --> 00:05:53,709
- How'd he know where we're going?
- What do you care? It's the bill that counts.

38
00:05:53,876 --> 00:05:58,376
- I should have shown him my money.
- Why did he give it to me?

39
00:05:59,876 --> 00:06:01,584
He liked your beard.

40
00:06:02,542 --> 00:06:04,709
It inspires confidence.

41
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:06,667
I guess so...

42
00:06:07,542 --> 00:06:10,542
Reminds me
of what my mother used to say.

43
00:06:55,667 --> 00:06:56,917
You're dirty...

44
00:07:00,876 --> 00:07:03,459
Go play with your brothers.

45
00:07:12,792 --> 00:07:14,459
Don't shave, my son.

46
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:16,751
A beard suits you.

47
00:07:26,542 --> 00:07:29,751
Wise woman, your mother.

48
00:07:31,167 --> 00:07:33,709
Can you sell me a cigarette?

49
00:07:33,876 --> 00:07:35,751
Take one.

50
00:07:36,626 --> 00:07:40,626
- The bill is for both of us.
- I appreciate it.

51
00:07:55,459 --> 00:07:56,876
What are you doing here?

52
00:07:58,542 --> 00:08:00,001
What happened?

53
00:08:02,876 --> 00:08:05,209
You've got blood on your hands.

54
00:08:08,167 --> 00:08:09,626
And there, look.

55
00:08:11,376 --> 00:08:12,626
There too.

56
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:16,459
What's your name?

57
00:08:17,792 --> 00:08:19,042
You on your own?

58
00:08:20,084 --> 00:08:22,084
Where are your parents?

59
00:08:22,584 --> 00:08:25,501
Cat got your tongue? Here.

60
00:08:26,876 --> 00:08:28,751
A drop of wine will do you good.

61
00:08:29,834 --> 00:08:32,084
Pierre, come on, let's go.

62
00:08:33,042 --> 00:08:36,584
You should go home.
Shall we take you back to the village?

63
00:08:37,667 --> 00:08:39,376
We can't do anything.

64
00:08:44,334 --> 00:08:46,376
Don't bother, they won't stop.

65
00:09:14,834 --> 00:09:17,751
Get in! What are you waiting for?

66
00:09:34,084 --> 00:09:36,667
- Going far?
- To Spain, sir.

67
00:09:37,459 --> 00:09:40,792
That's lucky,
I am going to the border.

68
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,251
- Do you mind driving at night?
- Not in the least.

69
00:09:51,667 --> 00:09:56,292
- This is a bed fit for a queen.
- It's really comfortable.

70
00:09:57,334 --> 00:09:59,667
God Almighty. God Almighty...

71
00:11:01,834 --> 00:11:04,834
- You want some?
- No, thank you.

72
00:11:05,001 --> 00:11:08,542
- You from around here?
- Yes. Nearby...

73
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:13,292
- I'll drop you off...
- Thanks, but I like walking at night.

74
00:11:15,417 --> 00:11:17,959
In any case

75
00:11:18,584 --> 00:11:22,126
the miracles of Christ have nothing
miraculous about them.

76
00:11:22,292 --> 00:11:25,001
- They are quite commonplace.
- Oh really?

77
00:11:25,167 --> 00:11:27,626
These days, science explains everything.

78
00:11:27,792 --> 00:11:31,126
Miracles are natural phenomena,
whether you like it or not.

79
00:11:31,292 --> 00:11:36,667
I think science is more than ever
in accord with scripture.

80
00:11:36,834 --> 00:11:39,542
That's why the whole world
is Catholic these days.

81
00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:43,709
- How do you mean, Catholic?
- Yes, the whole world.

82
00:11:43,876 --> 00:11:47,834
- What about the Muslims?
- They're certainly Catholic.

83
00:11:48,001 --> 00:11:51,167
- And the Jews?
- Even more so.

84
00:12:12,167 --> 00:12:13,584
What do you want?

85
00:12:13,751 --> 00:12:17,709
Do you have any leftovers?
We have money.

86
00:12:18,209 --> 00:12:19,626
All right, wait.

87
00:12:24,584 --> 00:12:25,751
Good day to you all...

88
00:12:25,917 --> 00:12:27,376
Hello.

89
00:12:28,459 --> 00:12:30,751
Invite them in, it's cold outside.

90
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:34,251
- I didn't want to disturb you.
- Of course not.

91
00:12:34,417 --> 00:12:35,459
Come in.

92
00:12:35,626 --> 00:12:37,876
- Thank you, sir.
- Sit down there.

93
00:12:39,167 --> 00:12:43,417
You will never make me believe, Father,
that the body of Christ

94
00:12:43,584 --> 00:12:45,667
can be contained in a piece of bread.

95
00:12:46,542 --> 00:12:48,626
Be careful.

96
00:12:50,084 --> 00:12:52,542
His body is not "contained".

97
00:12:53,334 --> 00:12:57,626
In the sacrament of Eucharist,
the wafer is the body of Christ.

98
00:12:57,792 --> 00:13:01,417
There is transubstantiation,
which is altogether different.

99
00:13:01,584 --> 00:13:05,626
I would like to understand, but I don't.

100
00:13:06,751 --> 00:13:08,084
It's beyond me.

101
00:13:10,459 --> 00:13:14,417
The Host is the body of Christ, that's all.

102
00:13:15,209 --> 00:13:19,084
You must not believe it
to be merely a symbol...

103
00:13:19,251 --> 00:13:22,459
of the body of Christ.
That was the belief of the Albigensians,

104
00:13:22,626 --> 00:13:26,959
the Calvinists - and others.
It is a grave error.

105
00:13:27,126 --> 00:13:32,001
I say Christ is in the Host
like the hare is in this pâté.

106
00:13:32,167 --> 00:13:33,792
- What?
- Yes.

107
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:36,584
It's hare and, at the same time,
it's a pâté.

108
00:13:36,751 --> 00:13:40,459
You've understood nothing!
You speak like 16th-century heretics

109
00:13:40,626 --> 00:13:42,167
known as Pateliers.

110
00:13:42,334 --> 00:13:46,084
No, you must believe
Christ's words to the letter.

111
00:13:46,251 --> 00:13:49,417
It's something I just can't conceive of.

112
00:13:49,584 --> 00:13:52,001
All the more reason:
"Credo quia absurdum."

113
00:13:52,167 --> 00:13:54,542
Religion without mystery
is no religion.

114
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:56,334
To sum up...

115
00:13:56,501 --> 00:14:01,792
Heresies which attack a mystery
may seduce superficial spirits

116
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:05,584
but they will never succeed
in obscuring the truth.

117
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,334
- Father, I have a question.
- Yes?

118
00:14:09,501 --> 00:14:12,417
What becomes of Christ
once in our stomach?

119
00:14:13,209 --> 00:14:14,876
What are you doing here?

120
00:14:15,834 --> 00:14:18,251
- Where are your papers?
- Here.

121
00:14:24,834 --> 00:14:26,334
Dupont...

122
00:14:27,376 --> 00:14:28,709
Duval...

123
00:14:28,876 --> 00:14:32,417
Get out of here!
We've had enough of you.

124
00:14:32,584 --> 00:14:33,751
Good night.

125
00:14:38,126 --> 00:14:39,542
Imbeciles.

126
00:14:41,001 --> 00:14:45,292
Not even a crust of bread?
A little charity, sergeant.

127
00:14:45,876 --> 00:14:50,417
You can't enforce the law
and be charitable.

128
00:14:55,709 --> 00:14:58,209
- It's strange...
- What is?

129
00:14:58,376 --> 00:15:02,626
I have the feeling the Pateliers were right.
It's a revelation.

130
00:15:03,376 --> 00:15:06,792
I feel that the body of Christ is in the Host

131
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,709
like the hare in this pâté.
I'm absolutely sure of it.

132
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:13,667
- But you just said the opposite.
- Me?

133
00:15:13,834 --> 00:15:15,292
Yes, you!

134
00:15:37,001 --> 00:15:41,584
Out for a walk again, Father?
You promised to be good.

135
00:15:41,751 --> 00:15:45,834
- We're going to have to lock you up.
- I wanted a breath of air.

136
00:15:46,001 --> 00:15:49,876
No, don't bother. I promise, I'll be good...

137
00:15:50,042 --> 00:15:52,584
- You know me...
- That's just it!

138
00:15:53,542 --> 00:15:55,292
If you insist...

139
00:15:55,459 --> 00:15:58,459
Strange, he seemed normal enough.

140
00:15:58,626 --> 00:16:01,542
- Is he really a priest?
- Yes, of course.

141
00:16:02,209 --> 00:16:05,792
He was a priest in Chevilly
until last year, then...

142
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:08,959
- You must have contradicted him.
- Perhaps.

143
00:16:09,126 --> 00:16:10,376
I knew it.

144
00:16:47,292 --> 00:16:48,751
Touch my hand.

145
00:16:51,001 --> 00:16:53,084
Cold hands, warm heart...

146
00:16:54,251 --> 00:16:55,709
A warm heart...

147
00:16:55,876 --> 00:16:59,417
- How old are you?
- Fifty nine.

148
00:17:00,126 --> 00:17:03,042
And... you still can?

149
00:17:04,334 --> 00:17:06,167
At my age...

150
00:17:08,626 --> 00:17:12,126
- The first thing when I get to Santiago...
- OK, OK.

151
00:17:12,834 --> 00:17:14,584
Do you hear that?

152
00:17:16,792 --> 00:17:19,584
Sounds like people talking.

153
00:17:20,667 --> 00:17:22,042
Do you reckon?

154
00:17:36,792 --> 00:17:39,501
Tu ergo nil intelleges.

155
00:17:39,667 --> 00:17:41,667
Regiam incipit.

156
00:17:42,751 --> 00:17:45,209
- What's he saying?
- I don't know.

157
00:17:45,376 --> 00:17:46,917
Quisnam est tu?

158
00:17:47,084 --> 00:17:49,167
Undenam venis?

159
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:51,792
Quicquam quaesis pax tibi?

160
00:17:51,959 --> 00:17:53,834
Venite, attamen,

161
00:17:54,001 --> 00:17:58,876
deusque videbis,
nec verbum dicere tibi recepit.

162
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:08,792
- Who is he then?
- No idea.

163
00:18:09,709 --> 00:18:12,959
A shepherd who talks like a priest.

164
00:18:17,584 --> 00:18:18,709
I'm going to sleep.

165
00:18:36,667 --> 00:18:37,834
Good night.

166
00:19:08,834 --> 00:19:11,084
Brethren...

167
00:19:11,667 --> 00:19:17,834
Good tidings from Rome.

168
00:19:19,209 --> 00:19:21,834
The Emperor Gratian

169
00:19:22,001 --> 00:19:27,876
has restored Priscillian
to the bishopric of Avila.

170
00:19:38,001 --> 00:19:41,126
So, we are justified.

171
00:19:41,667 --> 00:19:44,876
The heretic is not I

172
00:19:45,042 --> 00:19:49,084
but he who sits on the throne of St Peter

173
00:19:49,251 --> 00:19:55,459
and who has taken the title of Pope.

174
00:19:55,626 --> 00:20:02,459
Our doctrine is justified
and soon we will proclaim it

175
00:20:02,626 --> 00:20:06,751
in broad daylight, to the whole world.

176
00:20:06,917 --> 00:20:10,209
Let us give thanks unto God.

177
00:20:36,917 --> 00:20:41,417
Our soul is of divine essence.

178
00:20:41,584 --> 00:20:46,834
Like the angels it was created by God

179
00:20:47,001 --> 00:20:49,417
and placed beneath the sway of the stars.

180
00:20:49,584 --> 00:20:53,501
In punishment for sin,
it was united to a body...

181
00:20:53,667 --> 00:20:58,084
This body is the work of the devil

182
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:05,751
who exists from the beginning
like God himself.

183
00:21:06,459 --> 00:21:13,834
Matter so unworthy and base
as our body,

184
00:21:14,001 --> 00:21:17,167
God cannot have created.

185
00:21:17,626 --> 00:21:21,126
The body is the prison of the soul.

186
00:21:21,292 --> 00:21:24,876
The soul, in order to free itself...

187
00:21:25,042 --> 00:21:28,501
must gradually become detached from it.

188
00:21:28,667 --> 00:21:35,084
The body must be humiliated, despised...

189
00:21:35,251 --> 00:21:41,959
unceasingly submitted
to the pleasure of the flesh.

190
00:21:42,126 --> 00:21:46,626
In order that the purified soul
may return after death

191
00:21:46,792 --> 00:21:49,042
to its celestial abode.

192
00:21:52,167 --> 00:21:56,542
Swear never to betray this secret.

193
00:21:56,709 --> 00:21:59,126
We swear.

194
00:23:03,917 --> 00:23:06,584
It is not I who have harvested thee,
nor ground thee.

195
00:23:06,751 --> 00:23:12,626
It is not I who have kneaded thee
nor put thee in the oven.

196
00:23:12,792 --> 00:23:18,376
I am innocent
of all your sufferings.

197
00:23:18,542 --> 00:23:22,292
And I wish that those
who have inflicted them

198
00:23:22,459 --> 00:23:25,751
may know the same agony.

199
00:24:03,917 --> 00:24:05,501
What's that?

200
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,501
You scared?

201
00:24:23,084 --> 00:24:26,459
- I don't like storms.
- That won't protect you.

202
00:24:26,626 --> 00:24:28,001
How do you know?

203
00:24:29,417 --> 00:24:32,709
- You believe in God?
- You know I do.

204
00:24:33,751 --> 00:24:35,751
Watch this...

205
00:24:39,709 --> 00:24:40,917
Where are you going?

206
00:24:43,876 --> 00:24:48,334
Hey! You hear me?
If you exist, go ahead!

207
00:24:48,501 --> 00:24:51,084
You fool! Right between the eyes!

208
00:24:51,542 --> 00:24:54,292
One, two, three...

209
00:24:58,501 --> 00:24:59,542
See?

210
00:25:08,917 --> 00:25:10,917
It didn't get me!

211
00:25:11,084 --> 00:25:15,126
Imbecile, do you think God's
at your disposal?

212
00:27:04,042 --> 00:27:06,751
- As I was saying earlier...
- What?

213
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:11,584
- Everyone ought to believe in God.
- Yes.

214
00:27:11,751 --> 00:27:15,501
There have always been atheists,
but they're mad.

215
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:19,542
- Or they're not real atheists.
- How so?

216
00:27:19,709 --> 00:27:24,917
Because a reasonable man
cannot believe there is no God.

217
00:27:25,084 --> 00:27:27,417
- And why not?
- Why not?

218
00:27:27,584 --> 00:27:30,417
The proof is in the Bible.
Psalms 13, verse 1...

219
00:27:30,584 --> 00:27:34,876
"It is the fool who hath said in his heart:
'There is no God'"

220
00:27:36,709 --> 00:27:40,751
- Well that settles it.
- Yes, it is very convincing.

221
00:27:40,917 --> 00:27:43,251
There is no God.

222
00:27:45,459 --> 00:27:49,001
All religions are based
on a false premise, Thérèse:

223
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:52,876
the necessity of God the Creator.

224
00:27:53,042 --> 00:27:55,501
But this Creator does not exit.

225
00:27:55,667 --> 00:28:00,542
All religions bear the emblem
of imposture and stupidity.

226
00:28:01,459 --> 00:28:07,251
But if one especially deserves
our contempt and hatred,

227
00:28:07,417 --> 00:28:10,584
it is the barbarous law
of Christianity,

228
00:28:10,751 --> 00:28:13,334
in which we were both born.

229
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:19,584
You rely on an avenging God.
Don't be a fool, Thérèse.

230
00:28:19,751 --> 00:28:23,042
Such a god is merely a chimera...

231
00:28:23,792 --> 00:28:27,251
to be found in the fantasies of madmen.

232
00:28:27,751 --> 00:28:31,042
He is a phantom invented by
the wickedness of men

233
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:35,709
whose only purpose is to deceive us
or raise us up against each other.

234
00:28:35,876 --> 00:28:41,626
If this Lord existed,
considering the imperfections of His works,

235
00:28:41,792 --> 00:28:44,042
could we do anything but despise Him

236
00:28:44,626 --> 00:28:45,876
or outrage Him?

237
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:50,626
If there were a God,
there would be less evil on earth.

238
00:28:54,334 --> 00:28:56,751
Look, your ear is still bleeding.

239
00:28:57,959 --> 00:29:03,167
Is it a crime to depict the bizarre inclinations
with which Nature inspires us?

240
00:29:05,209 --> 00:29:07,251
No, Thérèse, there is no God,

241
00:29:08,251 --> 00:29:10,334
Nature is sufficient to herself.

242
00:29:10,501 --> 00:29:15,667
This godlike phantom
is nothing but a revolting platitude

243
00:29:15,834 --> 00:29:19,417
which does not deserve
a moment's consideration.

244
00:29:19,584 --> 00:29:21,917
A pitiful extravagance

245
00:29:22,084 --> 00:29:25,167
which the mind rejects
and the heart rebels at,

246
00:29:25,334 --> 00:29:29,001
which should've emerged from darkness
only to re-enter it forever!

247
00:29:32,084 --> 00:29:34,292
If your God exists, I hate Him!

248
00:29:34,459 --> 00:29:38,376
Yes, God exists! God exists!

249
00:29:49,876 --> 00:29:53,792
Only sons of bitches don't believe in God.

250
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:56,501
If debauchees deny God,
it's to satisfy their passions

251
00:29:56,667 --> 00:29:59,167
for who can deny the obvious?

252
00:30:06,542 --> 00:30:11,792
What I don't get is how Christ
could be both God and man.

253
00:30:12,376 --> 00:30:14,042
It is difficult, I admit...

254
00:30:14,751 --> 00:30:18,501
But when the Devil takes the shape
of a wolf, for instance,

255
00:30:18,667 --> 00:30:21,876
he is a wolf, but he's still the Devil.

256
00:30:22,042 --> 00:30:24,417
- It's somewhat the same with Christ.
- But...

257
00:30:24,584 --> 00:30:29,126
- Clean up the cloakroom, it's getting late.
- Right away, sir.

258
00:30:30,751 --> 00:30:34,792
If Jesus was God,
how could He be born and die?

259
00:30:34,959 --> 00:30:40,751
It's a fundamental question.
How could He born and die?

260
00:30:41,584 --> 00:30:45,126
How many heresies have been
on this subject!

261
00:30:45,917 --> 00:30:52,001
Some have said Christ was only God.
That His human form was an illusion.

262
00:30:52,167 --> 00:30:55,751
- So didn't He eat?
- No, He only pretended to.

263
00:30:55,917 --> 00:31:02,042
He didn't suffer - or die.
Marcion was of this opinion.

264
00:31:02,209 --> 00:31:05,417
- Nestorius, too, wasn't he?
- He was.

265
00:31:05,584 --> 00:31:10,542
They even said Christ watched
His own death on the cross,

266
00:31:10,709 --> 00:31:13,001
Simon having taken his shape.

267
00:31:13,167 --> 00:31:20,167
Other heretics maintained the contrary,
that Christ was not God but man.

268
00:31:20,334 --> 00:31:22,542
Get rid of this, it's rotten.

269
00:31:23,792 --> 00:31:29,417
But He could laugh and cough, couldn't He?
They always show Him so dignified.

270
00:31:30,917 --> 00:31:34,417
Walking slowly, his hands like this.

271
00:31:35,001 --> 00:31:37,501
He must have walked
like anyone else.

272
00:31:50,876 --> 00:31:53,459
We're late. What time is it?

273
00:31:55,959 --> 00:31:59,751
- Almost the 6th hour.
- I'm hungry.

274
00:32:05,834 --> 00:32:07,292
- Master!
- What?

275
00:32:07,459 --> 00:32:11,167
The guests have arrived
and your mother and brethren also.

276
00:32:11,334 --> 00:32:13,376
Behold - my mother and my brethren.

277
00:32:14,417 --> 00:32:18,334
For whosoever shall do the will,
of my father,

278
00:32:18,501 --> 00:32:22,667
the same is my brother,
my sister and my mother!

279
00:32:35,042 --> 00:32:39,251
If He was a man, He was
like the rest of us, wasn't He?

280
00:32:45,334 --> 00:32:47,417
At the beginning...

281
00:32:49,001 --> 00:32:54,126
I didn't dare to believe...
but afterwards I was very happy.

282
00:32:54,292 --> 00:32:57,084
He is marvellous.

283
00:33:07,459 --> 00:33:10,334
Just a moment...

284
00:33:18,376 --> 00:33:23,126
Once a rich man learned
that his steward...

285
00:33:25,001 --> 00:33:30,376
was wasting his wealth.
So he said unto him...

286
00:33:30,542 --> 00:33:36,292
"Thou mayst no longer care for my goods."

287
00:33:37,292 --> 00:33:43,334
The steward said to himself:
"What shall I do?

288
00:33:43,501 --> 00:33:49,126
"I'm not strong enough to dig.
And to beg I am ashamed

289
00:33:51,792 --> 00:33:55,209
"Ah, I know what to do

290
00:33:55,376 --> 00:33:58,917
"so that others may receive me."

291
00:34:03,001 --> 00:34:04,376
And?

292
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:07,001
One moment.

293
00:34:10,251 --> 00:34:16,167
He summoned his master's debtors
and said to the first: "What dost thou owe?"

294
00:34:16,334 --> 00:34:22,001
"100 measures of oil."
"Set down 50," said the steward.

295
00:34:22,167 --> 00:34:24,876
And to another he said:
"What dost thou owe?"

296
00:34:25,042 --> 00:34:31,292
"100 measures of wheat."
"Set down 80," the steward commanded.

297
00:34:33,626 --> 00:34:38,792
And the master praised his dishonest
steward for his shrewdness.

298
00:34:38,959 --> 00:34:43,167
For the children of this world are
wiser among themselves

299
00:34:43,334 --> 00:34:45,584
than the children of light.

300
00:35:01,792 --> 00:35:02,959
Come.

301
00:35:15,042 --> 00:35:19,667
- They have no wine...
- What has it to do with thee and I?

302
00:35:19,834 --> 00:35:21,292
Mine hour is not yet come!

303
00:35:24,084 --> 00:35:26,584
Whatsoever he sayeth unto you, do it.

304
00:35:29,334 --> 00:35:33,459
Fill the water pots with water and serve it.
They shall have wine.

305
00:35:38,501 --> 00:35:41,126
No doubt about it,
he was a man like the rest.

306
00:35:41,292 --> 00:35:47,376
In the 4th century, after the Council of Nicea,
many Christians fought and died

307
00:35:47,542 --> 00:35:52,376
in order to prove whether Christ was like
unto the Father, or consubstantial...

308
00:35:54,042 --> 00:35:58,084
Good day, madam, sir...
This way, please.

309
00:36:03,917 --> 00:36:04,959
Thank you.

310
00:36:06,209 --> 00:36:07,251
Thank you.

311
00:36:11,876 --> 00:36:14,834
Do you mind if I ask
what you were speaking about?

312
00:36:15,001 --> 00:36:18,626
- Oh, about one thing and another,
- But about what?

313
00:36:18,792 --> 00:36:22,209
We were speaking of Christ
of His double nature.

314
00:36:22,376 --> 00:36:24,917
You've studied for the priesthood?

315
00:36:25,084 --> 00:36:28,459
No, but the subject interests me.

316
00:36:28,626 --> 00:36:30,417
And we were wondering how it was that

317
00:36:30,584 --> 00:36:33,792
although there were so many healers
and prophets at the time

318
00:36:33,959 --> 00:36:36,542
like Simon the Sorcerer for example,

319
00:36:36,709 --> 00:36:40,292
Christ was the only one
who succeeded finally.

320
00:36:40,459 --> 00:36:44,209
- Why, because only He was God!
- Quite so, Madame Garnier.

321
00:36:44,376 --> 00:36:48,667
- The oysters are splendid today.
- Oysters, why not?

322
00:36:49,376 --> 00:36:51,792
Excuse me.

323
00:37:00,001 --> 00:37:01,876
Who gave you permission?

324
00:37:02,751 --> 00:37:05,792
Sir, we were just going to ask
if you have some...

325
00:37:05,959 --> 00:37:07,542
All we wanted was...

326
00:37:07,709 --> 00:37:11,792
Out! Go on, get a move on.

327
00:38:12,167 --> 00:38:14,042
Worth a try.

328
00:38:17,959 --> 00:38:21,126
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen,
this is Jean, I'm Pierre.

329
00:38:21,292 --> 00:38:23,792
Could you spare a little...

330
00:38:23,959 --> 00:38:26,917
- Pass me the chicken.
- Thank you.

331
00:38:27,084 --> 00:38:28,126
Thanks a lot.

332
00:38:32,001 --> 00:38:33,167
Going far?

333
00:38:33,334 --> 00:38:35,459
- To Spain, madam.
- On foot?

334
00:38:35,626 --> 00:38:39,501
- Sometimes on foot, sometimes walking!
- Do you want a drop of wine?

335
00:38:39,667 --> 00:38:41,126
I won't say no.

336
00:38:42,084 --> 00:38:43,959
Puts a little fire in your belly.

337
00:38:46,292 --> 00:38:49,209
- Ladies and gentlemen, to your health!
- And to yours!

338
00:38:59,251 --> 00:39:00,542
My dear friends...

339
00:39:01,292 --> 00:39:05,792
I am very happy to present
our little yearly performance

340
00:39:05,959 --> 00:39:11,751
that we prepared for you
and I ask your kind indulgence.

341
00:39:15,251 --> 00:39:21,084
As you all know,
this year has been a difficult one.

342
00:39:21,251 --> 00:39:26,084
Violence is everywhere, these days,
but thanks be to God,

343
00:39:26,251 --> 00:39:29,751
our classes have been undisturbed.

344
00:39:39,959 --> 00:39:46,084
In a few moments,
the older girls will present a witty comedy

345
00:39:46,251 --> 00:39:52,209
written especially for us
by Mr Pontier, our young pharmacist.

346
00:40:00,084 --> 00:40:06,001
Before that, you will hear a recital
by years 10 and 11

347
00:40:06,167 --> 00:40:13,667
from the works of our great poets:
Racine, Lamartine and Henri de Régnier.

348
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:25,626
But first, to show that in
the young hearts confided to our care

349
00:40:25,792 --> 00:40:29,209
religion is a living reality,

350
00:40:29,376 --> 00:40:33,501
here is a brief prologue by our young girls.

351
00:40:33,667 --> 00:40:34,959
Go on...

352
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:02,876
Brigitte.

353
00:41:03,792 --> 00:41:08,334
If anyone holds it permissible for
a Christian to have several wives...

354
00:41:08,501 --> 00:41:13,167
and that having several wives is not
forbidden by divine law...

355
00:41:13,334 --> 00:41:15,917
Anathema upon him!

356
00:41:20,751 --> 00:41:24,084
If anyone holds that the sacrifice of the Mass

357
00:41:24,251 --> 00:41:29,459
is a blasphemy against the sacrifice
of Christ who died upon the cross...

358
00:41:29,626 --> 00:41:31,584
Anathema upon him!

359
00:41:34,376 --> 00:41:38,626
If anyone holds that God's
commandments are impossible to keep

360
00:41:38,792 --> 00:41:42,542
even for one who is justified
and in a state of grace...

361
00:41:42,709 --> 00:41:44,709
Anathema upon him!

362
00:41:44,876 --> 00:41:47,501
Anathema upon him!

363
00:41:48,917 --> 00:41:50,167
Aim...

364
00:41:53,751 --> 00:41:55,626
Fire!

365
00:41:57,459 --> 00:42:00,417
Is there a shooting-range near here?

366
00:42:01,459 --> 00:42:04,917
No, it's me. I was imagining
they were shooting a Pope.

367
00:42:05,084 --> 00:42:06,042
What?

368
00:42:06,209 --> 00:42:09,542
You will certainly see a lot of things

369
00:42:09,709 --> 00:42:13,042
but never the shooting of a Pope.

370
00:42:14,292 --> 00:42:18,792
If anyone holds that God hates
the new-born baby...

371
00:42:18,959 --> 00:42:22,876
and that He punishes him
for the sin of Adam...

372
00:42:23,042 --> 00:42:24,751
Anathema upon him!

373
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:27,626
Anathema upon him!

374
00:42:28,501 --> 00:42:30,167
Many Christians

375
00:42:30,334 --> 00:42:34,917
wonder why God permits
innocent animals to suffer...

376
00:42:35,834 --> 00:42:41,251
Many also wonder
why God did not make man herbivorous

377
00:42:41,417 --> 00:42:44,792
like the sheep and the giraffe.

378
00:42:44,959 --> 00:42:52,042
Well, little Sylvie, the first in her class,
will give you the answer.

379
00:42:54,334 --> 00:43:00,292
If anyone holds that meats
God has given us are unclean

380
00:43:00,459 --> 00:43:03,376
and except from a desire
for self-mortification

381
00:43:03,542 --> 00:43:05,834
abstains from eating them...

382
00:43:06,001 --> 00:43:08,126
Anathema upon him!

383
00:43:08,292 --> 00:43:11,126
Anathema upon him!

384
00:43:11,626 --> 00:43:13,167
Where did that originate?

385
00:43:14,292 --> 00:43:16,376
At the Council of Nicea...

386
00:43:17,917 --> 00:43:21,709
At the Council of Braga, in 567 AD.

387
00:43:22,459 --> 00:43:25,126
I say and I maintain

388
00:43:25,292 --> 00:43:29,584
that Purgatory is never mentioned
in the scriptures,

389
00:43:29,751 --> 00:43:36,667
that confirmation and Extreme Unction
were not instituted by Christ!

390
00:43:37,167 --> 00:43:38,876
Anathema!

391
00:43:43,042 --> 00:43:48,292
You shall die
for you have relapsed into your errors.

392
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:52,042
But you have one chance of escaping Hell.

393
00:43:53,209 --> 00:43:57,292
Say "I recant" and your soul shall be saved.

394
00:44:00,334 --> 00:44:01,626
I cannot.

395
00:44:02,792 --> 00:44:04,834
I would like to, but I cannot.

396
00:44:06,792 --> 00:44:08,001
I cannot...

397
00:44:09,417 --> 00:44:10,876
Take him away.

398
00:44:38,376 --> 00:44:41,042
- Father?
- Yes, my son.

399
00:44:46,709 --> 00:44:49,626
- One thing troubles me.
- Yes?

400
00:44:50,459 --> 00:44:52,876
The burning of heretics

401
00:44:53,042 --> 00:44:56,459
may it not go against
the will of the Holy Spirit?

402
00:44:56,626 --> 00:45:00,584
It is the secular justice of men
that punishes them.

403
00:45:02,042 --> 00:45:08,626
Not because they are heretics
but for their sedition.

404
00:45:09,876 --> 00:45:13,126
But then, those whose brothers
have been burnt

405
00:45:13,292 --> 00:45:15,792
will burn others, and so on.

406
00:45:17,292 --> 00:45:20,209
Each one believing he possesses the truth.

407
00:45:21,376 --> 00:45:24,667
Why these millions of deaths?

408
00:45:25,751 --> 00:45:27,542
Do you know what you are saying?

409
00:45:28,751 --> 00:45:30,209
I am not sure.

410
00:45:31,167 --> 00:45:32,667
Yet you persist?

411
00:45:34,626 --> 00:45:35,667
No...

412
00:45:36,542 --> 00:45:38,251
I submit, Father.

413
00:46:12,834 --> 00:46:14,084
What's the matter?

414
00:46:14,251 --> 00:46:17,626
Thought I'd sit down,
my feet are killing me.

415
00:46:17,792 --> 00:46:19,126
Let me see.

416
00:46:22,376 --> 00:46:23,751
I'll fix that.

417
00:46:24,626 --> 00:46:28,709
- They'll never make it.
- It's better than nothing.

418
00:46:41,584 --> 00:46:43,959
Go on. Hope you crash, you bastard!

419
00:47:27,959 --> 00:47:31,667
- Think he's still alive?
- No. Not a chance.

420
00:47:37,792 --> 00:47:40,709
What shall we do now?
We better call the police.

421
00:47:40,876 --> 00:47:42,209
I wouldn't...

422
00:47:44,751 --> 00:47:47,042
They'll hold you up for hours.

423
00:47:48,001 --> 00:47:49,667
Just leave.

424
00:47:53,459 --> 00:47:55,667
Where did you come from?

425
00:47:56,751 --> 00:47:58,251
I don't understand a thing.

426
00:47:59,417 --> 00:48:03,209
- Are you hurt?
- I got in when you hoped he'd crash.

427
00:48:04,251 --> 00:48:06,209
I always get in at the last moment.

428
00:48:07,876 --> 00:48:10,417
- What about us?
- Go away!

429
00:48:12,084 --> 00:48:13,751
I already told you.

430
00:48:13,917 --> 00:48:15,959
Who are you?

431
00:48:18,167 --> 00:48:19,584
A labourer...

432
00:48:20,751 --> 00:48:23,209
A labourer who is never out of work.

433
00:48:23,376 --> 00:48:25,334
There are millions of us down there.

434
00:48:25,501 --> 00:48:26,709
Down where?

435
00:48:43,001 --> 00:48:45,959
There were tears are of no avail

436
00:48:46,126 --> 00:48:48,459
and repentance no succour.

437
00:48:54,667 --> 00:49:00,417
Where prayers go unheeded
and good resolutions are rejected.

438
00:49:03,876 --> 00:49:07,709
Where no time is given for repentance.

439
00:49:14,709 --> 00:49:21,334
For once under the veil of death,
it is too late to repent.

440
00:49:35,792 --> 00:49:37,876
One day we shall be saved.

441
00:49:39,834 --> 00:49:43,626
On Judgement Day,
God will have mercy on us.

442
00:49:45,542 --> 00:49:47,417
You with the sore feet...

443
00:49:57,459 --> 00:49:59,126
Look.

444
00:50:00,376 --> 00:50:02,459
He won't be needing them.

445
00:51:17,251 --> 00:51:21,292
Be careful.
They'll see that your shoes are new.

446
00:51:22,834 --> 00:51:24,501
I'll fix that for you.

447
00:51:31,209 --> 00:51:32,334
Don't move.

448
00:52:08,417 --> 00:52:11,209
My daughter, I beg of you...

449
00:52:11,376 --> 00:52:13,876
- Renounce.
- No, Mother.

450
00:52:14,042 --> 00:52:17,376
I will suffer like our saviour.

451
00:52:17,542 --> 00:52:23,834
Look, the Earl, our benefactor,
has come to dissuade you.

452
00:52:31,542 --> 00:52:32,709
Are you in pain?

453
00:52:32,876 --> 00:52:36,917
No. I feel nothing. Now the other hand.

454
00:52:37,084 --> 00:52:40,209
My daughter,
Christ does not require this of you.

455
00:52:43,667 --> 00:52:46,084
It's closed, you can't go in.

456
00:52:59,667 --> 00:53:01,667
What were you going to do in there?

457
00:53:01,834 --> 00:53:03,292
- Who us?
- Yes, you.

458
00:53:04,084 --> 00:53:07,834
- We wanted to visit the chapel.
- Do you know why it's closed?

459
00:53:08,001 --> 00:53:09,459
No...

460
00:53:10,292 --> 00:53:14,959
This convent is contaminated by
the last of the Jansenists...

461
00:53:15,126 --> 00:53:17,667
They commit the most fearful
sacrilege in there.

462
00:53:17,834 --> 00:53:21,167
There are convulsionaries, fanatics.

463
00:53:21,334 --> 00:53:23,001
Don't go in!

464
00:53:43,376 --> 00:53:45,084
How do you feel, my daughter?

465
00:53:45,251 --> 00:53:48,167
Very well...

466
00:53:49,167 --> 00:53:52,209
Now go. All of you.

467
00:53:52,376 --> 00:53:54,251
Don't you want anything?

468
00:53:56,001 --> 00:53:58,709
I wish to be alone.

469
00:54:49,251 --> 00:54:51,292
A word, sir...

470
00:54:51,959 --> 00:54:53,251
Who are you?

471
00:54:53,417 --> 00:54:56,542
I am Father Billuard,
of the Company of Jesus.

472
00:54:56,709 --> 00:55:00,751
Isn't it at night that Jesuits
come out, like rats?

473
00:55:01,251 --> 00:55:03,084
What language!

474
00:55:03,251 --> 00:55:06,542
It serves the likes of you!
Now, I'm in a hurry...

475
00:55:07,917 --> 00:55:13,334
I know where you come from,
what goes on in this holy place.

476
00:55:13,501 --> 00:55:17,459
I also know that you still deny
the true doctrine of Grace.

477
00:55:19,167 --> 00:55:23,709
In the fallen state of nature
inward grace is irresistible.

478
00:55:23,876 --> 00:55:27,917
Do you dare repeat that
in a more retired spot?

479
00:55:28,084 --> 00:55:29,876
Sir, I am at your disposal.

480
00:55:30,042 --> 00:55:31,376
Follow me.

481
00:55:37,542 --> 00:55:41,209
Gentlemen, will you act as our witnesses?

482
00:55:43,126 --> 00:55:44,459
What for?

483
00:55:44,626 --> 00:55:46,042
In a duel.

484
00:55:46,751 --> 00:55:48,417
We don't know anything about it!

485
00:55:48,584 --> 00:55:51,001
You will judge according
to your conscience.

486
00:55:51,167 --> 00:55:52,626
Come.

487
00:56:12,417 --> 00:56:15,167
Now do you dare repeat that?

488
00:56:15,334 --> 00:56:20,001
Yes! In the fallen state of nature
inward grace is irresistible.

489
00:57:03,709 --> 00:57:06,959
Grace does not always
obtain its object.

490
00:57:26,001 --> 00:57:27,584
One moment, please.

491
00:57:28,501 --> 00:57:32,001
Can you deny that one of the elect
has grace sufficient

492
00:57:32,167 --> 00:57:36,209
- for the accomplishment of good?
- Yes, I deny it.

493
00:57:36,376 --> 00:57:40,167
The will is submitted
to preponderant delectation.

494
00:57:47,334 --> 00:57:51,834
To deserve and not deserve
in the corrupted state of nature

495
00:57:52,001 --> 00:57:57,126
it is not necessary for man to have free will
exempt from necessity.

496
00:57:57,292 --> 00:58:01,042
To deserve and not deserve
in the corrupted state of nature

497
00:58:01,209 --> 00:58:05,917
man must be delivered from all necessity,
absolute and even relative.

498
00:58:14,667 --> 00:58:20,126
It is a semi-Pelagian error
to hold that Jesus Christ dies for all men.

499
00:58:20,292 --> 00:58:22,417
You blaspheme
against Divine Goodness.

500
00:58:22,584 --> 00:58:26,834
He died so that all might be saved.

501
00:58:49,376 --> 00:58:52,001
Antecedent will is mere wishful thinking.

502
00:58:52,167 --> 00:58:56,459
I have no control
over my thought and free will.

503
00:58:56,626 --> 00:58:59,167
My free will is an illusion.

504
00:59:00,667 --> 00:59:03,709
What does "free will" mean?

505
00:59:03,876 --> 00:59:08,959
It means that between two actions,
a good and a bad one, you can choose.

506
00:59:10,626 --> 00:59:12,834
Yes, but God knows everything, doesn't He?

507
00:59:13,001 --> 00:59:15,751
If I choose the bad,
He knows it beforehand.

508
00:59:15,917 --> 00:59:18,501
Yes, He has always known.

509
00:59:18,667 --> 00:59:22,209
How am I free if what I am going to do
is fixed ahead of time?

510
00:59:23,792 --> 00:59:25,459
That's free will.

511
00:59:25,626 --> 00:59:28,667
God's grace helps
you to choose the good.

512
00:59:28,834 --> 00:59:31,626
But He decided I would do evil.

513
00:59:31,792 --> 00:59:35,917
He decided, not me!
Why did He choose evil?

514
00:59:36,084 --> 00:59:40,917
God's designs are impenetrable.
Hey, look.

515
00:59:58,209 --> 01:00:00,584
We're for it if they want our passports.

516
01:00:00,751 --> 01:00:04,417
- For the French, an identity card is enough.
- We'll see.

517
01:00:11,417 --> 01:00:14,542
La Concha de San Sebastian -
what does that mean?

518
01:00:15,459 --> 01:00:18,084
San Sebastian's shell, isn't it?

519
01:00:18,584 --> 01:00:21,167
- I prefer the Riviera.
- Ever been there?

520
01:00:21,334 --> 01:00:25,417
- No, but I've heard.
- It's strictly for the rich.

521
01:00:26,626 --> 01:00:30,167
Come on or we'll never get to Santiago.

522
01:00:54,084 --> 01:00:55,376
Where are you going?

523
01:00:56,334 --> 01:00:58,084
Straight ahead.

524
01:00:58,251 --> 01:01:01,667
- If you don't mind...
- What?

525
01:01:01,834 --> 01:01:06,084
There's an inn over there.
Take the donkey and wait for us.

526
01:01:06,251 --> 01:01:10,917
- Till when?
- Tonight. We're going to the village.

527
01:01:12,126 --> 01:01:13,876
Here, we're in a hurry.

528
01:01:16,751 --> 01:01:19,501
- It's gold!
- Of course.

529
01:01:19,667 --> 01:01:22,584
- What if you don't come?
- We will.

530
01:01:22,751 --> 01:01:25,292
- Won't we?
- Of course.

531
01:01:25,459 --> 01:01:29,626
If we don't, keep everything.
Here. Until tonight.

532
01:03:51,292 --> 01:03:56,209
Thou didst die in the order of sanctity,
having received the last sacrament.

533
01:03:56,376 --> 01:04:00,042
Thou wert for us already one of the blessed.

534
01:04:00,209 --> 01:04:02,042
Alas.

535
01:04:05,251 --> 01:04:10,001
After thy death, all thy errors were
discovered in this manuscript.

536
01:04:10,167 --> 01:04:13,001
Many believed thee.

537
01:04:13,167 --> 01:04:16,167
Blood flowed, be it on thy head.

538
01:04:16,334 --> 01:04:22,667
May God whose mercy is infinite
take pity on the soul.

539
01:04:26,417 --> 01:04:27,751
Remove him.

540
01:04:57,417 --> 01:04:59,001
Hear me...

541
01:05:00,542 --> 01:05:04,167
This is the dogma, the sole truth.

542
01:05:04,334 --> 01:05:09,501
There is only one God, in Trinity:
Father, Son and Holy Spirit.

543
01:05:10,126 --> 01:05:13,334
The Father is neither created
nor engendered,

544
01:05:13,501 --> 01:05:16,626
the Son is not created but engendered,

545
01:05:16,792 --> 01:05:19,251
the Holy Spirit is neither
created nor engendered

546
01:05:19,417 --> 01:05:22,209
but proceedeth from the Father and Son.

547
01:05:22,376 --> 01:05:26,792
The Son and the Holy Spirit exist
from all eternity like the Father.

548
01:05:27,542 --> 01:05:31,501
Whosoever strays from this dogma
shall be declared a heretic.

549
01:05:31,667 --> 01:05:33,126
God is one.

550
01:05:36,584 --> 01:05:37,959
Listen, all of you!

551
01:05:40,167 --> 01:05:45,001
They are deceiving you!
The one God cannot be divided in Three.

552
01:05:45,167 --> 01:05:49,292
Father, Son and Holy Spirit
are only names we give to Him.

553
01:05:51,251 --> 01:05:55,667
It was the Father made flesh
who suffered.

554
01:05:55,834 --> 01:05:57,876
The Father who died on the cross!

555
01:05:59,959 --> 01:06:03,042
The Son and the Holy Spirit
are coeternal with the Father

556
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:06,501
by an immanent and necessary
operation of the Father.

557
01:06:06,667 --> 01:06:08,626
The Father is the only God!

558
01:06:08,792 --> 01:06:11,167
The Holy Spirit is merely an archangel.

559
01:06:12,001 --> 01:06:13,876
Seize them!

560
01:06:37,001 --> 01:06:39,542
Let me do this,
I know this door.

561
01:07:36,209 --> 01:07:37,667
Let's see.

562
01:08:50,084 --> 01:08:51,417
- Did you get it?
- No.

563
01:08:51,584 --> 01:08:52,501
What was it?

564
01:08:52,667 --> 01:08:55,459
Something stretched out, with no paws.

565
01:08:55,626 --> 01:08:59,792
I heard there were sleepwalkers
in the forest.

566
01:08:59,959 --> 01:09:01,042
I haven't seen them yet.

567
01:09:01,209 --> 01:09:03,959
They only come out
under a full moon.

568
01:09:04,126 --> 01:09:08,001
- What's that?
- Let's see.

569
01:09:08,167 --> 01:09:11,626
- Know what it is?
- It's like what the blind make.

570
01:09:11,792 --> 01:09:15,667
It's a rosary. It's what the Papists
use to pray the Virgin.

571
01:09:15,834 --> 01:09:17,209
Is that right?

572
01:09:18,334 --> 01:09:19,751
Get ready.

573
01:10:00,792 --> 01:10:02,584
Give me a light.

574
01:10:10,251 --> 01:10:13,834
- What time is it?
- Quarter to seven.

575
01:10:14,001 --> 01:10:18,667
Time flies.
Seems like yesterday.

576
01:10:18,834 --> 01:10:21,459
We have inherited the fruit
of their travail.

577
01:10:21,626 --> 01:10:23,459
The day of trial approaches.

578
01:10:23,626 --> 01:10:25,959
We cannot any longer
await a miracle.

579
01:10:26,834 --> 01:10:28,334
Your hear that?

580
01:10:30,667 --> 01:10:31,709
There! Look!

581
01:10:35,042 --> 01:10:37,001
What is it?

582
01:10:42,709 --> 01:10:46,709
- You see her?
- Yes, but...

583
01:10:48,709 --> 01:10:50,417
Look, she's moving!

584
01:11:33,126 --> 01:11:35,042
It was her! I'm sure of it!

585
01:11:35,209 --> 01:11:38,959
You're tired. It was a hallucination.

586
01:11:39,126 --> 01:11:40,917
And that?

587
01:12:31,626 --> 01:12:33,501
- How's things?
- Fine.

588
01:12:37,834 --> 01:12:39,209
What will it be?

589
01:12:39,376 --> 01:12:41,459
I don't know... Some chorizo.

590
01:12:41,626 --> 01:12:44,334
Same for me.

591
01:12:44,917 --> 01:12:47,292
And a pitcher of red.

592
01:12:54,209 --> 01:12:59,959
- Did you sell the tractor?
- Are you kidding? They still use mules!

593
01:13:00,126 --> 01:13:03,876
- And they're right.
- You sound like my grandpa.

594
01:13:04,042 --> 01:13:06,126
It's just my opinion.

595
01:13:10,251 --> 01:13:13,584
- Want a taste?
- With pleasure.

596
01:13:19,251 --> 01:13:21,667
Here. Tell me what you think.

597
01:13:26,084 --> 01:13:29,292
- Delicious! Do you cure it?
- Of course.

598
01:13:29,459 --> 01:13:31,292
- A little more?
- No, thank you.

599
01:13:31,459 --> 01:13:33,292
Good evening, everybody.

600
01:13:33,459 --> 01:13:36,667
- Everything all right?
- Everything's fine, thank you.

601
01:13:36,834 --> 01:13:40,876
Seems two suspicious-looking
characters came in here.

602
01:13:41,917 --> 01:13:43,709
Do you have your papers?

603
01:13:43,876 --> 01:13:45,917
- Yes, sir.
- Let's see.

604
01:14:02,334 --> 01:14:04,751
I don't want to see you
here tomorrow morning

605
01:14:10,792 --> 01:14:16,417
- Father... Bit chilly this evening.
- Indeed. I came in to warm up.

606
01:14:16,584 --> 01:14:20,917
- A little ham and wine?
- It's very tempting.

607
01:14:21,084 --> 01:14:22,876
It's excellent, I recommend it.

608
01:14:24,042 --> 01:14:30,542
I heard you were promoted to Sergeant.
Not bad, at your age.

609
01:14:30,709 --> 01:14:36,417
- It was expected. I've earned it.
- Quite a career.

610
01:14:36,584 --> 01:14:41,292
- So you're to be a father again soon?
- We're not rich.

611
01:14:52,667 --> 01:14:54,626
Here they are.

612
01:14:56,167 --> 01:14:57,501
We'd given up on you!

613
01:14:57,667 --> 01:15:00,376
- We saw the donkey outside.
- Put him in the stable?

614
01:15:00,542 --> 01:15:03,417
Yes, he must be hungry.

615
01:15:05,042 --> 01:15:06,917
Gentlemen...

616
01:15:07,084 --> 01:15:10,542
- Good hunting?
- No. Nothing all day.

617
01:15:10,709 --> 01:15:14,001
That's unusual.
Have you got your permits?

618
01:15:14,167 --> 01:15:16,667
- Of course.
- Let's have a look.

619
01:15:21,292 --> 01:15:23,626
All in order.

620
01:15:23,792 --> 01:15:25,709
Right. Shall we go?

621
01:15:25,876 --> 01:15:28,167
- Thanks for everything.
- Don't mention it.

622
01:15:28,334 --> 01:15:30,876
See you. Goodbye. Father...

623
01:15:31,042 --> 01:15:32,292
Evening, all.

624
01:15:33,376 --> 01:15:36,376
- Do you want to eat?
- No, just a room.

625
01:15:36,542 --> 01:15:37,584
Fine.

626
01:15:41,001 --> 01:15:43,834
- Good evening, Father.
- Good evening.

627
01:16:07,459 --> 01:16:09,001
What's the matter with you?

628
01:16:10,042 --> 01:16:12,334
You're crying?

629
01:16:12,501 --> 01:16:14,709
Can I help you?

630
01:16:16,042 --> 01:16:17,501
You should tell him...

631
01:16:20,084 --> 01:16:22,126
- Father...
- Be quiet.

632
01:16:25,709 --> 01:16:28,042
- Do you see this rosary?
- Yes, of course.

633
01:16:29,167 --> 01:16:32,584
- The Virgin Mary just gave it to me.
- The Blessed Virgin?

634
01:16:32,751 --> 01:16:34,209
- Yes.
- When?

635
01:16:34,876 --> 01:16:36,626
A half-hour ago.

636
01:16:38,084 --> 01:16:41,209
I saw her. She appeared to me.

637
01:16:42,501 --> 01:16:45,042
I scorned her, I was insulting her.

638
01:16:47,251 --> 01:16:50,001
Faith does not come to us
by reason, Father,

639
01:16:50,167 --> 01:16:51,792
but by the heart.

640
01:16:52,626 --> 01:16:56,459
Of course. Here, keep it.

641
01:16:59,542 --> 01:17:02,626
A miracle is always very moving.

642
01:17:02,792 --> 01:17:05,209
But you must not let yourself
get in such a state.

643
01:17:05,376 --> 01:17:09,001
The Blessed Virgin has appeared
thousands of times.

644
01:17:09,167 --> 01:17:10,834
All over the world.

645
01:17:11,001 --> 01:17:15,792
She has performed countless miracles.
Shall I tell you one?

646
01:17:15,959 --> 01:17:17,209
Oh, yes.

647
01:17:17,376 --> 01:17:19,876
Come, if it interests you...

648
01:17:20,042 --> 01:17:23,751
You too, come. All of you.

649
01:17:26,751 --> 01:17:28,084
Gather around.

650
01:17:35,834 --> 01:17:39,126
Now listen carefully.

651
01:17:41,376 --> 01:17:43,001
A very long time ago

652
01:17:43,167 --> 01:17:47,292
not very far from here,
at a Carmelite convent,

653
01:17:47,459 --> 01:17:52,251
there was a young sister,
very good and very trustworthy,

654
01:17:52,417 --> 01:17:56,501
the Treasurer of the convent, so to speak.

655
01:17:56,667 --> 01:18:00,667
She was very orderly, very responsible

656
01:18:00,834 --> 01:18:05,584
and profoundly devoted
to the Blessed Virgin.

657
01:18:05,751 --> 01:18:07,709
Now listen carefully.

658
01:18:07,876 --> 01:18:13,376
Unfortunately
one day, a young man seduced her.

659
01:18:13,542 --> 01:18:18,917
Some say it was the Devil.
But that hasn't been established.

660
01:18:19,084 --> 01:18:25,167
She fell madly in love with him
and decided to flee from the convent.

661
01:18:25,334 --> 01:18:26,709
Are you all with me?

662
01:18:28,542 --> 01:18:35,459
Just before her departure, one night,
the poor girl, in tears,

663
01:18:35,626 --> 01:18:38,084
flung herself down
at the altar of the Virgin,

664
01:18:38,251 --> 01:18:43,209
begging for forgiveness
in a passionate prayer.

665
01:18:43,376 --> 01:18:49,667
She placed at the feet of the statue
the key of the convent safe.

666
01:18:49,834 --> 01:18:51,501
Then she fled.

667
01:18:51,667 --> 01:18:52,917
Now listen carefully.

668
01:18:56,751 --> 01:19:03,167
She lived for a long time
- excuse me - with her seducer.

669
01:19:03,334 --> 01:19:04,792
For years.

670
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:08,667
They had children
- sons and daughters -

671
01:19:08,834 --> 01:19:12,834
but in the depths of her heart
she was unhappy.

672
01:19:13,001 --> 01:19:18,542
One morning, she decided
to return to the convent.

673
01:19:18,709 --> 01:19:21,709
She was ready to accept her punishment.

674
01:19:22,834 --> 01:19:27,001
She arrived without warning,
it was morning,

675
01:19:27,167 --> 01:19:33,959
and going through the chapel,
she looked at the statue of the Virgin.

676
01:19:34,126 --> 01:19:35,667
Now listen carefully.

677
01:19:37,167 --> 01:19:41,542
The key to the safe was still there!

678
01:19:44,834 --> 01:19:49,709
Then she went in, full of trepidation.

679
01:19:50,542 --> 01:19:56,084
But the nuns didn't even look
surprised to see her.

680
01:19:56,251 --> 01:19:58,459
As if she had never left.

681
01:19:59,876 --> 01:20:05,501
She went back to her chores
and no one ever said anything to her.

682
01:20:07,001 --> 01:20:08,251
Do you know why?

683
01:20:10,792 --> 01:20:16,751
Because, during her absence,
the Virgin had taken her shape

684
01:20:16,917 --> 01:20:19,959
and had fulfilled all her obligations.

685
01:20:23,167 --> 01:20:25,042
A most beautiful miracle.

686
01:20:25,209 --> 01:20:27,417
That's a wonderful tale.

687
01:20:27,584 --> 01:20:31,251
Really, Father, it is beautiful.

688
01:20:31,417 --> 01:20:36,667
There are even more beautiful ones.
I could go on all night.

689
01:20:38,042 --> 01:20:41,209
There is no mystery sweeter
or more profound

690
01:20:41,376 --> 01:20:44,584
than that of the Virgin Mary.

691
01:20:44,751 --> 01:20:48,334
It's getting late. I must go.

692
01:20:48,501 --> 01:20:51,626
- Good night.
- Good night, Father.

693
01:21:08,626 --> 01:21:10,209
Follow me, please.

694
01:21:12,501 --> 01:21:13,667
Coming...

695
01:22:05,084 --> 01:22:06,542
What are you doing?

696
01:22:13,251 --> 01:22:16,584
One does not place a candle
under a bushel

697
01:22:16,751 --> 01:22:19,667
but on a candlestick to give light.

698
01:22:28,751 --> 01:22:31,876
No, your room is just opposite.

699
01:22:32,042 --> 01:22:33,751
- There's room for two.
- No!

700
01:22:33,917 --> 01:22:37,751
- Why not?
- If you don't like it, you can go.

701
01:22:47,959 --> 01:22:49,292
Here.

702
01:22:55,584 --> 01:22:56,792
Gentlemen...

703
01:22:59,376 --> 01:23:01,459
A word of advice.

704
01:23:01,626 --> 01:23:03,959
If anyone knocks, don't open the door.

705
01:23:04,126 --> 01:23:07,626
- Why not?
- Just don't open it.

706
01:23:07,792 --> 01:23:09,334
To anyone.

707
01:23:11,292 --> 01:23:13,459
Even me.

708
01:23:17,751 --> 01:23:19,209
Good night.

709
01:24:35,792 --> 01:24:37,626
Good evening.

710
01:24:39,251 --> 01:24:40,959
Good evening, miss.

711
01:24:44,251 --> 01:24:46,292
Please don't let me disturb you.

712
01:24:47,084 --> 01:24:48,751
Thank you.

713
01:25:08,126 --> 01:25:10,542
You're very beautiful.

714
01:25:11,376 --> 01:25:13,376
You're very kind, thank you.

715
01:25:14,667 --> 01:25:16,917
You seem puzzled.

716
01:25:17,459 --> 01:25:19,834
- Your name?
- Rodolphe.

717
01:25:20,001 --> 01:25:21,042
Have you come far?

718
01:25:21,209 --> 01:25:23,667
Yes. On foot.

719
01:25:23,834 --> 01:25:25,584
Have a rest.

720
01:25:25,751 --> 01:25:28,542
It's quiet here.

721
01:25:28,709 --> 01:25:30,751
You will like it.

722
01:25:31,209 --> 01:25:32,209
Who is it?

723
01:25:32,376 --> 01:25:36,167
- Me... Open the door please!
- No!

724
01:25:36,334 --> 01:25:39,001
- Just a second.
- Out of the question.

725
01:25:40,292 --> 01:25:47,251
Listen, the Father is here.
He came back just to speak to you.

726
01:25:47,417 --> 01:25:49,834
- Open up.
- No!

727
01:25:56,792 --> 01:26:00,376
It's me again, my child.

728
01:26:00,542 --> 01:26:04,209
Excuse me for bothering you so late. But...

729
01:26:04,376 --> 01:26:11,251
When we spoke about the Blessed Virgin,
I forgot several important points.

730
01:26:14,292 --> 01:26:20,542
- Open up. I won't be long.
- No. You can speak from where you are.

731
01:26:20,709 --> 01:26:23,126
- But why?
- Because...

732
01:26:23,292 --> 01:26:25,376
As you wish.

733
01:26:26,376 --> 01:26:28,709
The chair, please.

734
01:26:37,626 --> 01:26:39,292
Thank you.

735
01:26:42,626 --> 01:26:47,751
You cannot conceive the richness
of mysteries concerning the Virgin.

736
01:26:47,917 --> 01:26:52,459
Think about it...
First, the Immaculate Conception.

737
01:26:52,626 --> 01:26:57,917
She was conceived without original sin.

738
01:26:59,126 --> 01:27:01,084
Then the birth of Christ

739
01:27:01,251 --> 01:27:04,876
commanded by the operation
of the Holy Spirit

740
01:27:05,042 --> 01:27:09,376
and the precious virginity of Mary!

741
01:27:09,542 --> 01:27:12,334
Imagine... Do you follow me?

742
01:27:12,501 --> 01:27:18,126
- Yes, Father.
- We do. With great attention.

743
01:27:19,084 --> 01:27:21,751
Then listen carefully...

744
01:27:21,917 --> 01:27:25,292
Imagine that she remained a virgin,
before, during

745
01:27:25,459 --> 01:27:28,292
and after the birth of Our Saviour.

746
01:27:29,292 --> 01:27:31,501
Certain heretics have denied it.

747
01:27:32,917 --> 01:27:39,001
Photin and Cleobule, for example.
But dogma must be believed.

748
01:27:39,167 --> 01:27:43,959
Christ was born of His mother
without breaking her virginity.

749
01:27:44,126 --> 01:27:45,626
Do you comprehend that?

750
01:27:46,167 --> 01:27:51,792
Yes, as thought springs
from the brain without breaking the skull.

751
01:27:54,001 --> 01:27:56,251
As a sunbeam
traverses a pane of glass.

752
01:27:56,417 --> 01:27:57,709
Very good.

753
01:27:58,542 --> 01:28:00,917
Finally, imagine her Assumption.

754
01:28:01,792 --> 01:28:06,667
She rose into heaven,
in flesh and blood, borne by angels,

755
01:28:06,834 --> 01:28:10,167
and from on high she acts
on behalf of sinners.

756
01:28:10,959 --> 01:28:12,834
Amazing.

757
01:28:13,001 --> 01:28:16,542
The dogma of the Assumption
is perhaps the most beautiful.

758
01:28:18,376 --> 01:28:20,459
A glass of water, please.

759
01:28:21,751 --> 01:28:24,667
Well, remember,
if you want her to love you

760
01:28:24,834 --> 01:28:28,834
that nothing is so repugnant to God
as the sin of impurity.

761
01:28:29,917 --> 01:28:36,376
Why is it that Jesus did not reply to Herod
or even raise His eyes?

762
01:28:37,084 --> 01:28:42,292
Because Herod was a Fornicator
and Jesus didn't wish to look at him.

763
01:28:42,459 --> 01:28:44,542
Very good, my daughter.

764
01:28:44,709 --> 01:28:47,709
Avoid lechers
as you would the plague.

765
01:28:47,876 --> 01:28:51,792
Remember the odious sects
of the Adamites, the Nicolaites

766
01:28:51,959 --> 01:28:57,292
who held their wives in common
and delivered themselves up to debauchery.

767
01:28:58,042 --> 01:29:00,792
It is written: " The house
of the impure woman

768
01:29:00,959 --> 01:29:02,667
"is the house of the dead."

769
01:29:02,834 --> 01:29:04,834
Yes, my children.

770
01:29:08,084 --> 01:29:12,959
- Now open the door.
- You're wasting you time, Father.

771
01:29:13,126 --> 01:29:14,376
Very well!

772
01:29:19,792 --> 01:29:22,292
- Father?
- Yes?

773
01:29:22,459 --> 01:29:24,584
Suppose we decide to get married?

774
01:29:24,751 --> 01:29:26,376
- Married?
- Yes.

775
01:29:28,251 --> 01:29:30,917
That would be quite different.

776
01:29:31,084 --> 01:29:35,376
But hear the words of the Apostle Paul:

777
01:29:35,542 --> 01:29:39,959
"It is good if a man takes no wife."

778
01:29:40,126 --> 01:29:41,834
You see?

779
01:29:42,667 --> 01:29:46,501
Furthermore you must know
that certain theologians,

780
01:29:46,667 --> 01:29:48,667
St Thomas, for instance,

781
01:29:51,001 --> 01:29:56,501
have sustained that even in wedlock
carnal union is venal sin.

782
01:29:57,126 --> 01:30:00,792
I am a virgin, Father,
and therefore, perhaps, without sin.

783
01:30:00,959 --> 01:30:05,459
Don't say that!
My child, no one is without sin.

784
01:30:05,626 --> 01:30:07,251
Not even the Holy Virgin?

785
01:30:07,751 --> 01:30:12,126
Of course. She was
incapable of committing sin.

786
01:30:12,292 --> 01:30:16,417
But do you know that Origen,
St Basil and St John Chrysostom

787
01:30:16,584 --> 01:30:20,917
- maintained that she had certain faults?
- Which ones?

788
01:30:21,917 --> 01:30:25,209
A little vanity perhaps,
the desire to be esteemed.

789
01:30:25,376 --> 01:30:29,209
Perhaps at the Annunciation
she doubted the words of the angel.

790
01:30:29,376 --> 01:30:34,626
And finally at the foot of the Cross,
her faith weakened slightly.

791
01:30:39,126 --> 01:30:42,042
Well, now I will let you sleep.

792
01:30:52,917 --> 01:30:56,084
- Good night, miss.
- Good night.

793
01:31:03,792 --> 01:31:07,376
- My son, do you hear me?
- Yes...

794
01:31:07,917 --> 01:31:11,709
- Open the door, I must speak to you.
- It's unnecessary, I heard everything.

795
01:31:11,876 --> 01:31:17,626
- Open up. Just five minutes.
- I said no and I mean it.

796
01:31:21,917 --> 01:31:24,042
Well, let you friend come out then.

797
01:31:28,667 --> 01:31:31,334
He doesn't want to. Go away.

798
01:31:48,167 --> 01:31:50,792
Oh yes, the sword. Thank you.

799
01:32:15,334 --> 01:32:19,167
My hatred of science
and my horror of technology

800
01:32:19,334 --> 01:32:23,459
will lead me one day
to an absurd belief in God...

801
01:33:14,709 --> 01:33:19,876
Funny meeting you here...
Up already? On you way?

802
01:33:20,917 --> 01:33:24,251
Why such a hurry?
Stay a few moments.

803
01:33:28,084 --> 01:33:29,751
What are you hiding?

804
01:33:32,542 --> 01:33:34,751
Well, well, a ham.

805
01:33:36,542 --> 01:33:38,209
It's ham from the inn.

806
01:33:40,667 --> 01:33:45,542
- We tasted some, remember?
- You're right, it's the same.

807
01:33:45,709 --> 01:33:48,167
- Where is this from?
- We...

808
01:33:48,334 --> 01:33:49,667
Did you buy it?

809
01:33:49,834 --> 01:33:52,709
- As a matter of fact, yes.
- From the innkeeper.

810
01:33:52,876 --> 01:33:54,126
Did you really buy it?

811
01:33:54,292 --> 01:33:57,626
- And it was not very expensive, either.
- That's right.

812
01:34:02,876 --> 01:34:06,792
Why didn't you say so before?
On your way.

813
01:34:06,959 --> 01:34:10,209
- Do you want a bit?
- We've even got wine.

814
01:34:10,376 --> 01:34:12,709
No thanks, really, not now.

815
01:34:12,876 --> 01:34:14,709
- You want some?
- No thanks.

816
01:34:14,876 --> 01:34:17,251
Some other time. Bon voyage.

817
01:34:17,417 --> 01:34:18,459
Good night.

818
01:34:19,209 --> 01:34:20,251
Good night.

819
01:34:37,501 --> 01:34:40,959
- Look! Santiago!
- At last!

820
01:34:41,126 --> 01:34:45,376
- About time, I was getting fed up.
- Me too.

821
01:35:07,917 --> 01:35:09,334
Come here!

822
01:35:14,542 --> 01:35:18,042
- What does the lady want?
- Let's go and see.

823
01:35:26,292 --> 01:35:29,959
Where are you two going
in such a hurry?

824
01:35:30,126 --> 01:35:31,542
To Santiago.

825
01:35:31,709 --> 01:35:35,292
- Pilgrims?
- No, for a little break.

826
01:35:35,459 --> 01:35:37,542
No need to hurry, nobody's there.

827
01:35:37,709 --> 01:35:39,834
- What?
- Nobody.

828
01:35:40,001 --> 01:35:45,376
In the four squares around the cathedral
there used to be thousands of pilgrims.

829
01:35:45,542 --> 01:35:48,251
Now they're all empty. Not a soul.

830
01:35:48,417 --> 01:35:51,834
Same thing in the hotels.

831
01:35:52,001 --> 01:35:53,834
How come?

832
01:35:57,376 --> 01:36:01,834
Seems somebody discovered
it wasn't St James' body

833
01:36:02,001 --> 01:36:06,834
but a fellow without a head
named Priscillian.

834
01:36:07,001 --> 01:36:11,834
They cut off his head a long time ago.
An unorthodox character, it seems.

835
01:36:12,001 --> 01:36:13,626
What are we going to do?

836
01:36:13,792 --> 01:36:18,501
Not in such a hurry, eh?
Want to go frolic in the grass?

837
01:36:18,667 --> 01:36:20,626
- Sure.
- Let's go.

838
01:36:20,792 --> 01:36:24,501
- Got any money?
- Gold, in fact.

839
01:36:24,667 --> 01:36:26,334
Let's see.

840
01:36:29,334 --> 01:36:30,792
Here.

841
01:36:31,667 --> 01:36:35,584
- It's beautiful!
- Easy does it. We'll settle that later.

842
01:36:35,751 --> 01:36:39,542
- Well, are we going or not?
- Come on.

843
01:36:53,251 --> 01:36:56,834
- Wait, I have something to tell you.
- Go on.

844
01:36:57,459 --> 01:36:59,126
Well?

845
01:36:59,667 --> 01:37:03,209
- I desire a child of you.
- Why?

846
01:37:03,376 --> 01:37:06,376
I'd call him: "Ye are not my people".

847
01:37:07,126 --> 01:37:09,584
"Ye are not my people..."

848
01:37:11,417 --> 01:37:14,501
And what if we had one?

849
01:37:14,667 --> 01:37:18,001
I'd call him: "No more mercy".

850
01:37:18,167 --> 01:37:19,959
"No more mercy..."

851
01:37:20,126 --> 01:37:21,209
Come on.

852
01:37:31,167 --> 01:37:32,709
Come on.

853
01:37:36,167 --> 01:37:40,001
He's there.
I hear Him. He's approaching.

854
01:37:40,917 --> 01:37:43,084
Lord, where are you?

855
01:37:43,251 --> 01:37:47,751
- Stop. Hear me!
- I hear Him. He is very close.

856
01:37:47,917 --> 01:37:50,917
Lord! Are you there, Lord?

857
01:37:53,459 --> 01:37:58,667
- Forget not what I told ye.
- No, Lord, Thou canst not die.

858
01:37:59,501 --> 01:38:02,417
Get thee behind me, Satan.

859
01:38:02,584 --> 01:38:06,417
For thy thought is not the thought of God
but that of men.

860
01:38:13,959 --> 01:38:15,792
Lord, we are here.

861
01:38:20,126 --> 01:38:21,917
What do ye want of me?

862
01:38:22,084 --> 01:38:25,917
- Have pity on us, son of David.
- Pity, Lord.

863
01:38:28,834 --> 01:38:33,917
- Believe ye that I am able to do this?
- Yes, Lord.

864
01:38:34,084 --> 01:38:36,792
According to thy faith be it unto thee.

865
01:39:06,751 --> 01:39:08,709
I see people.

866
01:39:08,876 --> 01:39:12,084
Like trees walking!

867
01:39:18,251 --> 01:39:20,209
A miracle, Lord!

868
01:39:21,251 --> 01:39:24,334
I see grass, trees.

869
01:39:24,501 --> 01:39:27,792
A miracle, Lord! I see You.

870
01:39:30,042 --> 01:39:33,376
See that no man know it.

871
01:39:34,709 --> 01:39:36,251
Why not?

872
01:39:40,167 --> 01:39:45,584
Why is it that we may not
tell Thy miracles?

873
01:39:45,751 --> 01:39:49,251
At Capharnaum,
Thou performedst many in public.

874
01:39:49,417 --> 01:39:51,667
Thou multipliedst
the loaves and fishes.

875
01:39:51,834 --> 01:39:54,626
Before thousands.

876
01:39:56,251 --> 01:39:59,167
Think not I come
to bring peace on earth.

877
01:39:59,334 --> 01:40:02,709
I come not to bring peace but a sword.

878
01:40:02,876 --> 01:40:06,459
Lord, a bird! I recognised it by
the sound of its wings.

879
01:40:08,001 --> 01:40:10,376
I am come to set man against father,

880
01:40:10,542 --> 01:40:14,042
daughter against mother,
step-daughter against mother-in-law.

881
01:40:14,209 --> 01:40:16,084
Verily, verily.

882
01:40:16,251 --> 01:40:18,417
Man's foes shall be
in his own household.

883
01:40:18,584 --> 01:40:23,292
Son of David, show me
the colours white and black.

884
01:40:28,001 --> 01:40:32,126
He that loveth his parents
more than me is not worthy of me.

885
01:40:32,292 --> 01:40:37,667
He that loveth his children
more than me is not worthy of me.

886
01:41:16,459 --> 01:41:21,001
Everything about Catholic dogma
and its attitude to heresy is exact.

887
01:41:21,167 --> 01:41:26,126
Texts and quotations are drawn
directly from the scriptures

888
01:41:26,292 --> 01:41:33,542
or from ancient and modern works of
theology and ecclesiastical history.
