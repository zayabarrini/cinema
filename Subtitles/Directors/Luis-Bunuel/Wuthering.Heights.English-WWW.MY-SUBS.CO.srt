WUTHERING HEIGHTS

3
00:01:09,388 --> 00:01:11,982
<i>This picture is based on
Wuthering Heights,</i>

4
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:14,590
<i>Its characters are
at the mercy of<i>

5
00:01:14,793 --> 00:01:16,920
<i>their own instincts and passions.</i>

6
00:01:17,129 --> 00:01:20,030
<i>They are unique beings for whom</i>

7
00:01:20,232 --> 00:01:23,827
</i>the social conventions do not exist.</i>

8
00:01:24,069 --> 00:01:26,765
<i>Alejandro's love for Catalina
is fierce and inhuman.</i>

9
00:01:26,972 --> 00:01:29,202
<i>It can only be fulfilled
through death.</i>

10
00:01:29,408 --> 00:01:31,899
<i>Above all,
this picture tries to remain true</i>

11
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:34,544
<i>to the spirit of
Emily Brontë's novel.</i>

12
00:02:01,974 --> 00:02:04,033
- Who fired that shot?
- Your wife.

13
00:02:04,309 --> 00:02:05,867
She killed some buzzards.

14
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:08,137
Just to play a bad joke on me.

15
00:02:08,347 --> 00:02:09,905
You're two little girls.

16
00:02:10,115 --> 00:02:12,481
Eduardo, tell her to leave me alone.

17
00:02:12,684 --> 00:02:14,743
- She doesn't listen to me.
- To me neither.

18
00:02:41,913 --> 00:02:45,644
- Eduardo, don't do that.
- Don't do what?

19
00:02:45,851 --> 00:02:48,752
Don't kill that animal.
Can't you see how it sufers?

20
00:02:49,254 --> 00:02:52,587
Don't be ridiculous.
This keeps it from sufering.

21
00:02:52,824 --> 00:02:54,815
It's the way to keep them intact.

22
00:02:55,093 --> 00:02:58,620
Isabel wishes you'd dissect
butterflies in a less cruel way.

23
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:00,661
I don't like to see animals sufer.

24
00:03:00,866 --> 00:03:04,063
I don't make them sufer.
I kill them with one shot.

25
00:03:04,836 --> 00:03:07,464
They go to death's liberty
painlessly.

26
00:03:10,242 --> 00:03:12,642
You are much crueller, Eduardo.

27
00:03:13,278 --> 00:03:17,009
Well, release that bird or kill it.
Why have it in a cage?

28
00:03:17,215 --> 00:03:18,842
Because I love it.

29
00:03:19,818 --> 00:03:23,185
Enough for you not to mind
being locked up, right?

30
00:03:23,488 --> 00:03:25,115
Why is that dog barking?

31
00:03:25,524 --> 00:03:27,492
It must be the buzzards again.

32
00:03:27,693 --> 00:03:30,423
Beware! They may
come through that door.

33
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:33,757
You can poke fun at me.
You're not scared of anything.

34
00:03:34,966 --> 00:03:38,458
As I know I'll have a short life,
I must like the things …

35
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:41,230
- that frighten people.
- You're incorrigible.

36
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,067
Because I say what I feel?

37
00:03:43,275 --> 00:03:46,073
Don't you realize
that such misgivings explain …

38
00:03:46,278 --> 00:03:48,644
many things about my life?

39
00:04:51,777 --> 00:04:54,371
- Take the meat to the larder.
- The ham as well?

40
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:15,859
- Good evening, Maria.
- Alejandro!

41
00:05:16,168 --> 00:05:17,726
I want to see Catalina.

42
00:05:20,338 --> 00:05:24,206
Go back the way you came.
We've had enough of trouble here.

43
00:05:24,442 --> 00:05:26,034
I want to see Catalina.

44
00:05:26,244 --> 00:05:27,802
Not at this hour!

45
00:05:28,013 --> 00:05:30,243
Come back tomorrow...
No, don't ever come back.

46
00:05:30,448 --> 00:05:32,712
Are you still afraid of me?

47
00:05:33,018 --> 00:05:35,077
You have the devil in you.

48
00:05:35,821 --> 00:05:38,381
We never had a moment's peace
with you. 

49
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:40,353
Leave us alone!

50
00:05:49,301 --> 00:05:50,768
Tell your mistress I'm here.

51
00:05:52,704 --> 00:05:55,468
- What was that?
- Must have been the wind.

52
00:05:55,841 --> 00:05:58,366
- It came from the kitchen.
- I'll go see.

53
00:06:02,147 --> 00:06:03,614
What broke, Maria?

54
00:06:08,386 --> 00:06:09,580
What happened, Maria?

55
00:06:09,788 --> 00:06:12,882
It's Alejandro, sir.
Alejandro has returned.

56
00:06:13,325 --> 00:06:14,519
What?

57
00:06:18,096 --> 00:06:20,929
- Where are you going?
- Leave me alone. I'm going to greet him.

58
00:06:21,132 --> 00:06:23,396
You stay here.
Ask him to come in, Maria.

59
00:06:25,937 --> 00:06:28,064
He was your parents' servant!

60
00:06:28,273 --> 00:06:31,208
- Let him come here.
- Alejandro is not a servant.

61
00:06:31,409 --> 00:06:34,640
my father adopted him
and we were raised together.

62
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,875
To me he is more than a brother.

63
00:06:37,315 --> 00:06:40,375
Don't forget that you are my wife.
Behave accordingly.

64
00:06:51,129 --> 00:06:53,256
-Catalina!
-Alejandro!

65
00:06:54,232 --> 00:06:56,598
Eduardo, it's him!
He's back.

66
00:06:56,801 --> 00:06:59,201
We thought you would never
come back again, Alejandro.

67
00:06:59,638 --> 00:07:01,606
I was sure he would.

68
00:07:01,806 --> 00:07:05,003
How could you have left me so long
without hearing from you?

69
00:07:05,377 --> 00:07:09,211
- Where have you been?
- In many places. Far away.

70
00:07:09,447 --> 00:07:13,178
Yes, some days it felt like I had
a lead weight in my heart.

71
00:07:13,852 --> 00:07:16,514
You were then so far
I couldn't reach you.

72
00:07:17,088 --> 00:07:19,579
I had moments of fatigue
during my work.

73
00:07:20,525 --> 00:07:22,925
You were then lying in the sun

74
00:07:23,194 --> 00:07:24,525
in despondency.

75
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:27,865
I shivered with cold
in the height of summer.

76
00:07:28,099 --> 00:07:29,964
You were then in a snowy country.

77
00:07:30,235 --> 00:07:31,862
I have always kept you here.

78
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:34,595
A minute after you left, you were
already back with me for good.

79
00:07:34,806 --> 00:07:37,900
- Catalina, come here.
- Your lips are bigger now.

80
00:07:38,643 --> 00:07:43,706
How many women
will you have kissed? Silly!

81
00:07:43,915 --> 00:07:47,681
I know you have
and it's been in vain.

82
00:07:48,053 --> 00:07:49,350
Catalina.

83
00:07:50,322 --> 00:07:53,883
Look at him, Eduardo.
He's so self-confident now!

84
00:07:54,459 --> 00:07:56,256
He must have got rich.

85
00:07:56,461 --> 00:07:59,259
Yes, I have become rich.
Does that bother you?

86
00:07:59,864 --> 00:08:03,095
That doesn't mean anything to us.
Right, Eduardo?

87
00:08:04,536 --> 00:08:08,939
Come. Look at Isabel.
She's changed so much, hasn't she?

88
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:13,770
- You remember her?
- I do. I remember everything.

89
00:08:16,181 --> 00:08:17,580
Everything!

90
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,212
Alejandro!

91
00:08:21,219 --> 00:08:24,017
Will you really let him go out
in a night like this?

92
00:08:25,924 --> 00:08:28,825
If he wants to stay the night,
he must say so.

93
00:08:29,194 --> 00:08:32,357
I'd rather die than spend one night
under this roof.

94
00:08:32,864 --> 00:08:36,994
You're still as wild as you were.
Where are you going?

95
00:08:37,202 --> 00:08:41,536
- I'll live with your brother on the farm.
- You think he'll let you in?

96
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:45,107
I don't intend to ask his permission.
Now the farm is almost mine.

97
00:08:49,547 --> 00:08:51,276
Is that true about my brother?

98
00:08:51,483 --> 00:08:53,417
Your brother has lost a fortune
gambling.

99
00:08:53,752 --> 00:08:56,880
That scoundrel must have taken
advantage of the situation.

100
00:09:06,998 --> 00:09:09,933
And to think that my brother
treated him worse than a dog.

101
00:09:10,135 --> 00:09:13,730
Alejandro used to say that one day
everything would be his.

102
00:09:14,139 --> 00:09:15,970
How can you talk like that,
Catalina?

103
00:09:16,174 --> 00:09:19,075
I admire people
who get what they want.

104
00:09:21,413 --> 00:09:24,075
You wouldn't have done that.
Would you, Eduardo?

105
00:09:24,282 --> 00:09:26,182
Don't compare me with that swine.

106
00:09:26,718 --> 00:09:29,346
- Can I tell you something?
- What?

107
00:09:30,055 --> 00:09:33,388
You will never love me
half as much as Alejandro does.

108
00:09:35,994 --> 00:09:38,963
Don't listen to her.
You know what she's like.

109
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:07,881
- Have you finished?
- In a minute.

110
00:10:11,396 --> 00:10:13,330
What's wrong with your brother?

111
00:10:13,531 --> 00:10:14,896
He won't understand.

112
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,227
Why don't you try to understand him?

113
00:10:17,435 --> 00:10:20,131
I'm a good wife,
I'll give him a child.

114
00:10:20,338 --> 00:10:23,933
- What more does he want?
- He wants to be able to live in peace.

115
00:10:25,243 --> 00:10:28,735
If you've always loved Alejandro
and he's always loved you,

116
00:10:28,947 --> 00:10:30,881
why didn't you marry him?

117
00:10:31,349 --> 00:10:34,841
Because my brother Ricardo
hated him.

118
00:10:35,053 --> 00:10:36,884
Eduardo hated him.

119
00:10:37,088 --> 00:10:41,320
- Everybody has always hated him.
- I have never hated him.

120
00:10:41,726 --> 00:10:45,992
You despised him like the rest.
If we had gotten married,

121
00:10:47,198 --> 00:10:49,666
you would have made beggars of us.

122
00:10:49,868 --> 00:10:52,063
I thought that to someone in love,
tribulations didn't matter.

123
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:56,165
You're a romantic fool
who repeats the nonsense you hear.

124
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:59,309
Alejandro means more to me
than my soul.

125
00:10:59,644 --> 00:11:03,842
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!
You have the devil in you.

126
00:11:04,549 --> 00:11:06,312
You sound crazy sometimes.

127
00:11:07,585 --> 00:11:09,519
See how you can't understand me?

128
00:11:37,815 --> 00:11:39,578
Leave me alone.

129
00:11:39,851 --> 00:11:43,378
You shouldn't act this way, Eduardo.
I've always told you the truth.

130
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:47,418
When you married me you knew
I'd never stop loving him.

131
00:11:47,692 --> 00:11:49,353
Leave me alone!

132
00:11:56,868 --> 00:12:01,237
I have been so stupid.
I had stopped thinking about him.

133
00:12:01,806 --> 00:12:04,297
I even hoped that he had died.

134
00:12:05,009 --> 00:12:09,309
How can you love a servant so much?

135
00:12:09,948 --> 00:12:12,143
Who turned him into one?

136
00:12:12,383 --> 00:12:14,112
Ricardo. He treated him
like a slave when my father died

137
00:12:14,319 --> 00:12:17,755
and made him live in the stable.

138
00:12:18,089 --> 00:12:21,820
You never liked him either,
always showing of your wealth.

139
00:12:22,227 --> 00:12:24,354
He had plenty of reasons
to hate you all.

140
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:28,629
If you love him so much,
why did you marry me?

141
00:12:29,968 --> 00:12:31,902
Are you going to be jealous now?

142
00:12:32,237 --> 00:12:36,571
Don't worry, I've never wanted
to cheat on you with him.

143
00:12:37,242 --> 00:12:40,973
That's not enough. I know
you won't go find him in his room.

144
00:12:41,379 --> 00:12:45,110
But you cheat on me in thought.
Why did you marry me?

145
00:12:45,984 --> 00:12:49,010
Because he was gone
and I thought forever.

146
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:53,020
Because I loved you.
Not the same way, but I loved you.

147
00:12:53,391 --> 00:12:56,792
Besides, I needed to have a child.

148
00:12:57,895 --> 00:13:00,523
Your love and mine
will end with death.

149
00:13:00,765 --> 00:13:03,029
My love for Alejandro is inhuman.

150
00:13:04,869 --> 00:13:09,465
- What if I killed him?
- It wouldn't do you any good.

151
00:13:10,108 --> 00:13:12,736
I would love him the same
after his death.

152
00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:29,283
Evil has come into this house.
Throw it out, Lord,

153
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,750
and let us live in Your company

154
00:14:31,956 --> 00:14:35,255
for the good of our souls.
Amen.

155
00:14:48,139 --> 00:14:49,629
We go to take away this.

156
00:15:37,588 --> 00:15:41,581
What are you doing here, you beast?
You want to stink up the house?

157
00:15:41,926 --> 00:15:44,292
Go to the kitchen
and put that out at once!

158
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:50,793
And I'll pull your ears.
You know I don't like to see you here.

159
00:15:56,307 --> 00:16:00,471
How many times must I tell you
I want no shouting in this house?

160
00:16:04,415 --> 00:16:08,442
How dare you speak to me like that?
Are you the owner of the farm?

161
00:16:08,653 --> 00:16:11,213
If you can't pay me in a month,
I am!

162
00:16:11,556 --> 00:16:14,116
In the meantime,
I don't want to be disturbed.

163
00:16:16,027 --> 00:16:19,224
Of course, you can win it all back
by gambling.

164
00:16:21,632 --> 00:16:24,692
If you ask him for more money,
you're done for.

165
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:27,162
Dirty devil!

166
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,366
You should have left him
in the street, where you found him.

167
00:16:31,576 --> 00:16:34,943
You are the master here.
Throw him in the street!

168
00:16:35,146 --> 00:16:37,979
You're to blame for this!
Let us be!

169
00:16:43,221 --> 00:16:46,850
Remember when you used to feed me
the leftovers in the stable?

170
00:16:47,758 --> 00:16:50,192
Now I can throw you out
whenever I please.

171
00:16:57,034 --> 00:16:58,763
Good morning, everyone.

172
00:17:04,842 --> 00:17:10,712
Fine, I get up at dawn,
ride five leagues on horseback
and you welcome me with long faces.

173
00:17:10,915 --> 00:17:13,543
If our visit bothers you,
we'll leave.

174
00:17:14,118 --> 00:17:16,985
Good morning, Jorgito.
Where are you going?

175
00:17:17,188 --> 00:17:18,917
Don't you remember me?

176
00:17:19,123 --> 00:17:22,388
- You don't say hello, Jorge?
- Or your aunt Catalina?

177
00:17:25,763 --> 00:17:28,254
It's a shame the way
your son behaves, Ricardo.

178
00:17:28,466 --> 00:17:29,763
He's a complete savage.

179
00:17:29,967 --> 00:17:34,836
You're here to see your beloved, right?
You're fit for each other. You nauseate me.

180
00:17:35,339 --> 00:17:38,638
- Are you drunk this early?
- Leave me alone.

181
00:17:39,844 --> 00:17:41,709
Good morning, Alejandro.

182
00:17:42,547 --> 00:17:45,914
I couldn't sleep a wink,
knowing I'd see you today.

183
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:48,577
We must see all the places …

184
00:17:48,786 --> 00:17:51,277
we used to hide when 
we were little. Coming?

185
00:17:56,961 --> 00:17:59,156
- Where are you going?
- With you two.

186
00:17:59,363 --> 00:18:01,058
No, you stay here.

187
00:18:01,265 --> 00:18:04,894
We'll go to places you don't know.
They're our places.

188
00:18:05,102 --> 00:18:06,831
only ours.

189
00:18:07,204 --> 00:18:11,732
Catalina and I will have a row.
You'd better stay here this time.

190
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:09,265
- Is it still here?
- I don't think anyone's been here.

191
00:19:09,467 --> 00:19:13,665
Remember? We wanted to get away.
To sail away on a boat.

192
00:19:13,904 --> 00:19:18,034
Sailboats still exist.
Here it is! Look.

193
00:19:18,242 --> 00:19:19,607
My knife.

194
00:19:19,844 --> 00:19:21,277
The ropes.

195
00:19:27,818 --> 00:19:29,649
Look, the lantern!

196
00:19:30,454 --> 00:19:33,651
You remember? You broke it
the day you threw it at me.

197
00:19:33,858 --> 00:19:34,847
With reason.

198
00:19:35,059 --> 00:19:37,220
You were angry
and refused to talk to me.

199
00:19:37,762 --> 00:19:39,457
You know something, Catalina?

200
00:19:41,532 --> 00:19:45,798
When I came back, I had only
one thing in mind: To get revenge.

201
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,503
From me as well?

202
00:19:47,872 --> 00:19:49,863
From everyone who made me sufer.

203
00:19:50,074 --> 00:19:53,407
I wanted to take everything 
and whip them away …

204
00:19:53,611 --> 00:19:56,409
- to stay alone with you.
- And you changed your mind?

205
00:19:58,582 --> 00:20:00,243
I must wait.

206
00:20:00,484 --> 00:20:03,146
You mean more to me
than my hate for them.

207
00:20:03,354 --> 00:20:06,983
Come on, Catalina. Right now.
It is time to escape again.

208
00:20:09,493 --> 00:20:11,552
I'm going to have Eduardo's child.

209
00:20:12,296 --> 00:20:13,661
I don't give a damn!

210
00:20:15,199 --> 00:20:18,168
We'll send it to him after its birth,
but you stay with me.

211
00:20:18,369 --> 00:20:20,303
It's too late, Alejandro.

212
00:20:21,939 --> 00:20:25,636
Stay here. All I need
is to have you close by.

213
00:20:25,843 --> 00:20:27,708
I want you only for myself.

214
00:20:28,212 --> 00:20:31,648
Would you like to be with a woman
who's always looking back?

215
00:20:31,982 --> 00:20:35,679
Catalina, come with me,
or I swear you'll be sorry.

216
00:20:37,488 --> 00:20:40,013
We've often threatened each other
in vain.

217
00:20:40,224 --> 00:20:42,249
This time I'll do something
that will hurt you.

218
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,360
You won't tell me what it is?

219
00:20:44,729 --> 00:20:45,991
No.

220
00:20:47,364 --> 00:20:48,854
Look.

221
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,731
Look.

222
00:20:51,335 --> 00:20:52,666
Look.

223
00:21:53,397 --> 00:21:56,389
- What's the matter?
- You've been spying on us.

224
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,033
Do I interest you that much?

225
00:21:58,235 --> 00:22:00,203
You're not
the one that interests me.

226
00:22:01,572 --> 00:22:04,268
Why are you looking at me like that?
Leave me alone.

227
00:22:08,579 --> 00:22:10,240
Catalina!

228
00:22:10,948 --> 00:22:14,975
I didn't expect that.
You're in love with Alejandro.

229
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:19,250
Ah, that was it.
You shouldn't have bothered to guess.

230
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:22,787
I'm in love with Alejandro.
You want more details?

231
00:22:27,932 --> 00:22:31,231
Sorry, Isabel.
I didn't want to make fun of you.

232
00:22:31,435 --> 00:22:33,733
But how is it possible
that in such a short time?

233
00:22:33,938 --> 00:22:36,702
That's the way it is.
I'm in love with him.

234
00:22:36,907 --> 00:22:39,933
And I love him at least
as much as you love Eduardo.

235
00:22:41,011 --> 00:22:42,239
I feel sorry for you.

236
00:22:42,446 --> 00:22:45,313
You don't know him.
I'm the only one who does.

237
00:22:45,516 --> 00:22:48,349
He's a savage
who only acts by instinct.

238
00:22:48,619 --> 00:22:50,917
- And you love him!
- I always have.

239
00:22:51,121 --> 00:22:53,851
But that doesn't blind me.
He'll play with you. 

240
00:22:54,058 --> 00:22:55,855
He'll make you
sufer like a poor devil.

241
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:59,086
Don't you realize that Alejandro
can only love me?

242
00:22:59,363 --> 00:23:03,663
- That's what you think.
- You think I'm jealous, right?

243
00:23:03,934 --> 00:23:07,199
No, Isabel. I'm giving you advice
as I would to a sister.

244
00:23:07,538 --> 00:23:10,166
Forget that man
before it's too late.

245
00:23:11,275 --> 00:23:15,075
Thank you for the advice, but I know
very well what I have to do.

246
00:23:24,588 --> 00:23:26,146
Listen to her.

247
00:23:26,357 --> 00:23:30,054
She knows that man better than me
and I've always known him.

248
00:23:30,327 --> 00:23:31,692
How did he get rich?

249
00:23:31,896 --> 00:23:34,922
Honest people
don't need to hide their lives.

250
00:23:35,132 --> 00:23:39,569
And why does he live with a man
he'd rather see six feet under?

251
00:23:40,004 --> 00:23:44,566
Who asked you anything?
This is none of your business.

252
00:24:09,433 --> 00:24:12,231
Alejandro, Come!

253
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:21,007
I knew you'd be taking that path.
Running away from me.

254
00:24:21,512 --> 00:24:23,002
And I knew ...

255
00:24:23,414 --> 00:24:26,440
you would come,
but not once did I look up here.

256
00:24:27,151 --> 00:24:28,982
You were furious, weren't you?

257
00:24:31,388 --> 00:24:32,719
- Yes.
- So was I.

258
00:24:46,503 --> 00:24:49,472
Do you like them, Alejandro?
Don't they suit me?

259
00:24:49,673 --> 00:24:52,870
Don't waste you time, Isabel.
Alejandro doesn't like those things.

260
00:24:53,077 --> 00:24:56,740
You really don't like them?

261
00:24:59,883 --> 00:25:02,943
Say something, Alejandro.
Don't you know she loves you?

262
00:25:03,387 --> 00:25:06,117
Why do you say that?
Leave me alone.

263
00:25:07,257 --> 00:25:09,657
You confessed
you were crazy for him!

264
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,155
She loves you more
than I do Eduardo.

265
00:25:12,363 --> 00:25:13,796
Let go of me!

266
00:25:13,998 --> 00:25:15,329
Do you dare deny it?

267
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:17,590
My sister-in-law is broken-hearted.

268
00:25:17,801 --> 00:25:21,601
By the moonlight and in her dreams,
she pronounces your name.

269
00:25:23,774 --> 00:25:27,175
And she hasn't eaten in three days
because of you.

270
00:25:32,316 --> 00:25:35,342
Look!
She's worse than a tiger!

271
00:25:36,053 --> 00:25:40,046
Be careful, Alejandro. She will bite you too,
if you marry her.

272
00:25:40,791 --> 00:25:44,420
If she did,
I'd pull her teeth out one by one.

273
00:25:44,695 --> 00:25:47,630
Why do you torture her so?
That can't be true.

274
00:25:47,831 --> 00:25:49,822
I swear it is.
She's crazy about you.

275
00:25:50,034 --> 00:25:53,003
All that seems ridiculous.
I'm going after her.

276
00:26:05,983 --> 00:26:07,575
Let me go!

277
00:26:08,585 --> 00:26:10,382
Is it true that you love me?

278
00:26:47,524 --> 00:26:48,991
Mr. Ricardo, sir.

279
00:26:52,362 --> 00:26:55,263
You don't have to announce me
when I come to my brother's house.

280
00:26:55,799 --> 00:26:58,632
Find something
to warm my stomach up.

281
00:26:58,836 --> 00:27:03,068
I believe it is already warm enough.
You don't need to drink any more.

282
00:27:03,273 --> 00:27:05,366
You think I'm drunk?

283
00:27:06,643 --> 00:27:08,133
I didn't come here to argue.

284
00:27:08,345 --> 00:27:12,441
I was on my way to town,
and it started to rain,
so I decided to come in.

285
00:27:12,916 --> 00:27:17,046
You weren't going to town
and didn't come in by chance.

286
00:27:17,254 --> 00:27:19,848
You were coming here,
and I know exactly why.

287
00:27:21,058 --> 00:27:22,184
Well then...

288
00:27:22,392 --> 00:27:25,259
Some time ago I said I would
never give you another penny.

289
00:27:26,497 --> 00:27:28,294
This time it's serious.

290
00:27:28,532 --> 00:27:32,161
If I don't pay the mortgage,
that scoundrel will keep the farm.

291
00:27:33,303 --> 00:27:36,431
I don't care about the farm.
You know I hate that house.

292
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:40,801
And having a neighbour like him
wouldn't bother you, either?

293
00:27:41,178 --> 00:27:43,408
I would try to keep him
away from here.

294
00:27:52,122 --> 00:27:55,888
Your wife goes to see him often.
They go out together.

295
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,188
Where they go and
what they do, only they know.

296
00:28:00,564 --> 00:28:04,500
I trust Catalina. How dare you speak
that way about your sister?

297
00:28:04,701 --> 00:28:07,101
I'll speak the same way about yours.

298
00:28:07,304 --> 00:28:09,534
That dog is after both of them.

299
00:28:10,807 --> 00:28:12,502
Won't you lend me the money?

300
00:28:12,709 --> 00:28:15,803
- No.
- Then let the devil take you all!

301
00:28:16,013 --> 00:28:18,709
They told me you were here.
Is something wrong, Ricardo?

302
00:28:21,685 --> 00:28:23,277
Why did he come?

303
00:28:26,123 --> 00:28:27,556
What's the matter, Eduardo?

304
00:28:27,758 --> 00:28:29,658
Is it true you have gone to see him?

305
00:28:31,128 --> 00:28:33,028
Why have you hidden it from me?

306
00:28:36,099 --> 00:28:38,294
You know I haven't. 

307
00:28:38,602 --> 00:28:42,003
You've always known where I was going.
Didn't you, Eduardo?

308
00:28:43,106 --> 00:28:44,630
Yes, I did.

309
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:49,170
If I could only be sure
you still love me.

310
00:28:49,379 --> 00:28:53,247
Don't see him anymore, Catalina.
I'm sufering very much.

311
00:28:53,917 --> 00:28:56,147
Promise you won't see him again.

312
00:28:56,353 --> 00:28:58,446
I promise
I won't look for him again.

313
00:30:00,584 --> 00:30:01,983
Where are you going?

314
00:30:08,725 --> 00:30:11,558
IsabeI! IsabeI!

315
00:30:14,898 --> 00:30:16,832
You must think I'm a beast.

316
00:30:17,034 --> 00:30:20,834
I know you aren't. It's not
your fault that you are as you are.

317
00:30:21,038 --> 00:30:25,031
Everybody has always maltreated you.
You need tenderness.

318
00:30:25,242 --> 00:30:28,006
- Your tenderness?
- Yes. Mine.

319
00:30:28,378 --> 00:30:30,471
And if you couldn't make me change?

320
00:30:30,681 --> 00:30:32,546
I'm sure I can.

321
00:30:33,784 --> 00:30:35,911
And if I didn't dare to ask you
to go out with me?

322
00:30:37,087 --> 00:30:38,577
I would.

323
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:42,488
- You love me that much?
- That much.

324
00:30:57,074 --> 00:30:59,235
Alejandro! Come here!

325
00:31:05,515 --> 00:31:07,142
Wait for me. I'll be right back.

326
00:31:32,309 --> 00:31:34,209
Well? Where are we going?

327
00:31:34,411 --> 00:31:37,903
Alejandro, I've told you
to leave Isabel alone many times.

328
00:31:38,415 --> 00:31:40,315
It hurts you when I kiss her.

329
00:31:40,517 --> 00:31:42,917
If Eduardo finds out,
we'll never see each other again.

330
00:31:43,453 --> 00:31:46,513
Put your dirty mouth anywhere,
but leave Isabel alone.

331
00:31:47,724 --> 00:31:50,852
Is it possible to be jealous
of a wax doll?

332
00:31:51,328 --> 00:31:54,320
She has the same eyes
as your husband. I hate them.

333
00:31:54,965 --> 00:31:57,331
Besides, you married the brother.

334
00:31:57,534 --> 00:31:59,092
Why can't I marry the sister?

335
00:31:59,302 --> 00:32:02,897
Because you're not in love. I can't
allow you to make her unhappy.

336
00:32:03,273 --> 00:32:05,833
I want to marry her
only to hurt you.

337
00:32:06,143 --> 00:32:07,667
And if I didn't care?

338
00:32:08,812 --> 00:32:13,112
If you didn't care I could cut
my throat this very minute.

339
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:21,054
Here! Cut your throat,
because it doesn't bother me a bit.

340
00:32:21,258 --> 00:32:23,123
Listen well. I don't care!

341
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:28,158
Catalina, you've always treated me badly,
I don't hold any grudge against you.

342
00:32:28,432 --> 00:32:30,161
But I have to hurt those …

343
00:32:30,367 --> 00:32:31,766
who kept me from you.

344
00:32:31,968 --> 00:32:34,664
I will not allow you
to bring any harm to Eduardo.

345
00:32:36,706 --> 00:32:39,675
Will you defend
that repulsive worm now?

346
00:32:47,517 --> 00:32:51,715
Sooner or later he will have to pay.
Too bad if it hurts you.

347
00:32:55,692 --> 00:32:57,819
I give you three minutes
to leave this house,

348
00:32:58,028 --> 00:33:00,553
if you don't want my servants
to throw you out.

349
00:33:00,764 --> 00:33:02,755
Is this what you call dignity?

350
00:33:03,099 --> 00:33:05,624
Why don't you throw
this scoundrel out?

351
00:33:06,336 --> 00:33:09,203
I see you devote your time
to eavesdropping.

352
00:33:09,406 --> 00:33:13,740
You can be proud of this individual.
He dares to threaten me, and look...

353
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:19,812
there you have him, trembling like a scared rabbit.
And you chose that bastard.

354
00:33:20,317 --> 00:33:24,447
- I will never forgive you.
- I was defending your own sister.

355
00:33:24,955 --> 00:33:28,652
You'd deserve to be beaten up by Alejandro
for doubting my integrity.

356
00:33:29,226 --> 00:33:32,821
But I can't even touch him.
He's scared to death.

357
00:33:33,096 --> 00:33:35,690
Hit him, Eduardo!
I bet you don't dare!

358
00:33:36,766 --> 00:33:39,326
You heard it.
Hit me! Hit me!

359
00:33:59,389 --> 00:34:01,857
Go away, Alejandro.
You've hurt me, but I don't …

360
00:34:02,058 --> 00:34:04,219
want anything to happen to you.

361
00:34:04,427 --> 00:34:07,055
Let me kill him.
I won't rest until I do.

362
00:34:07,264 --> 00:34:09,926
If you kill him,
what will happen to you? To me?

363
00:34:11,001 --> 00:34:12,298
Get away.

364
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,503
If you love me, Alejandro! 
go away.

365
00:34:18,708 --> 00:34:21,734
If I leave, I will do something
that will hurt more.

366
00:34:22,112 --> 00:34:23,636
Go away, Alejandro!

367
00:34:32,622 --> 00:34:34,351
Go get him!

368
00:34:38,261 --> 00:34:41,230
You must choose right now
between him and me forever.

369
00:34:41,498 --> 00:34:44,331
When you listen behind closed doors,
you hear everything.

370
00:34:44,568 --> 00:34:47,799
I called Alejandro to forbid him
to see Isabel again.

371
00:34:48,004 --> 00:34:50,131
You can't be his friend and my wife.

372
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:54,037
For God's sake!
Leave me alone. I'm going crazy.

373
00:34:54,244 --> 00:34:57,372
I don't want to wait anymore.
You must definitely choose!

374
00:34:57,581 --> 00:35:00,607
Go away! Leave me!
Can't you see how I am?

375
00:35:00,817 --> 00:35:02,648
Don't come near me!

376
00:35:02,852 --> 00:35:04,786
I should never have said anything.

377
00:35:04,988 --> 00:35:08,355
It was you!
Spy! Traitor!

378
00:35:08,558 --> 00:35:10,526
God knows what you've told him.

379
00:35:10,727 --> 00:35:14,959
I want to die!
You'll never see me again!

380
00:35:16,933 --> 00:35:19,299
Don't go now.
It would be useless, sir.

381
00:35:19,536 --> 00:35:20,525
What will she do?

382
00:35:20,737 --> 00:35:23,228
The usual.
Lock herself up and cry a while.

383
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,771
I'll go see.

384
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:55,098
She won't want it.

385
00:35:55,305 --> 00:35:57,273
Anyway, I'll go see.

386
00:36:13,256 --> 00:36:16,453
Mistress.
Mistress.

387
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,887
Mistress, open up, please.

388
00:36:19,162 --> 00:36:22,325
You haven't eaten all day.
Your dinner's here.

389
00:36:24,267 --> 00:36:25,666
Open up, Mistress!

390
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:36,008
I'm leaving your dinner here.

391
00:36:46,556 --> 00:36:49,252
IsabeI, Come here!

392
00:36:54,898 --> 00:36:57,128
I told you
not to see Alejandro anymore,

393
00:36:57,333 --> 00:36:59,324
and this morning you were with him.

394
00:36:59,536 --> 00:37:01,868
You're to blame
for what happened today.

395
00:37:02,072 --> 00:37:05,303
Why did you see him again?
Answer me!

396
00:37:07,911 --> 00:37:09,936
You will force me to lock you
in the house

397
00:37:10,146 --> 00:37:12,273
to defend you against yourself.

398
00:37:13,116 --> 00:37:15,380
That man can only do you harm.

399
00:37:19,556 --> 00:37:24,823
Eduardo, you have always been good to everyone,
I've never seen you hurt anybody.

400
00:37:25,628 --> 00:37:27,653
Why are you so cruel to him?

401
00:37:29,466 --> 00:37:32,663
Because he doesn't deserve kindness.
Much less from me.

402
00:37:32,936 --> 00:37:35,097
What similarities are there
between him and you?

403
00:37:35,305 --> 00:37:38,399
What have you seen in him
to make you lose your dignity?

404
00:37:41,611 --> 00:37:44,011
Alejandro is so unhappy.

405
00:37:44,214 --> 00:37:45,545
He's a beast …

406
00:37:45,749 --> 00:37:48,809
to whom
nothing respectable exists.

407
00:37:49,018 --> 00:37:52,078
He'll ignore even what's most sacred
to follow his instincts.

408
00:37:52,288 --> 00:37:55,849
And I don't want to carry on arguing.
I forbid you to see him again.

409
00:37:56,559 --> 00:37:59,756
If you do, I swear you'll be sorry.

410
00:39:07,764 --> 00:39:08,788
Maria, how is she?

411
00:39:08,998 --> 00:39:11,262
Go away.
You're responsible for all this.

412
00:39:11,467 --> 00:39:13,332
- How is she?
- I don't know.

413
00:39:13,536 --> 00:39:15,231
She's locked herself up
and won't see anyone.

414
00:39:15,438 --> 00:39:17,065
Go away or I'll call someone.

415
00:39:40,263 --> 00:39:42,026
- Maria.
- Yes, sir?

416
00:39:42,498 --> 00:39:44,796
- What time is it?
- It must be nine o'clock.

417
00:39:51,441 --> 00:39:52,635
- Is she still there?
- Yes.

418
00:39:52,842 --> 00:39:56,539
She doesn't even open the door
to get her food.

419
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,348
She hasn't eaten a bite
since yesterday morning.

420
00:39:59,816 --> 00:40:02,148
Go away.
I'll go up later.

421
00:40:33,483 --> 00:40:35,383
You little rascal!
come here!

422
00:40:35,585 --> 00:40:37,712
I'll show you!

423
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,463
Where is that damn boy?

424
00:40:53,169 --> 00:40:55,763
I'll show him not to run away
from his father.

425
00:41:35,478 --> 00:41:36,570
Good night.

426
00:41:37,613 --> 00:41:39,979
Has she any reasons
to behave this way?

427
00:41:40,383 --> 00:41:42,442
Didn't she ofend me?

428
00:41:42,685 --> 00:41:44,243
You know her.

429
00:41:44,454 --> 00:41:46,922
She will soon come to you
for forgiveness.

430
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:51,353
I don't want her to ask for
my forgiveness. I want to see her.

431
00:41:51,561 --> 00:41:53,358
Have patience.
It will be okay.

432
00:41:53,563 --> 00:41:55,724
But don't spend
another sleepless night.

433
00:41:55,932 --> 00:41:58,958
- Will you go to bed?
- I don't know...

434
00:42:33,603 --> 00:42:36,970
Open the door, Catalina.
I can't stand it any longer.

435
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:40,835
I want to speak to you.
I forgive you everything, but open the door.

436
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:03,225
-IsabeI?
- What do you want?

437
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:12,072
She won't open the door.
She doesn't answer me.

438
00:43:12,275 --> 00:43:13,572
Nor me...

439
00:43:13,776 --> 00:43:17,177
Just a little while ago,
Maria and I begged her to open.

440
00:43:18,314 --> 00:43:20,714
Tomorrow, I'll break down the door
if necessary.

441
00:43:21,617 --> 00:43:23,915
We must end this situation
once and for all.

442
00:44:06,028 --> 00:44:07,689
What are you doing here?

443
00:44:10,633 --> 00:44:12,760
Leave right now, Alejandro!

444
00:44:13,069 --> 00:44:14,934
I want to talk to you, Isabel.

445
00:44:15,371 --> 00:44:17,396
If you don't get out, I'll scream.

446
00:44:19,142 --> 00:44:20,734
Do it.

447
00:44:23,045 --> 00:44:24,512
Scream.

448
00:44:25,281 --> 00:44:27,681
Leave me, Alejandro!
Don't touch me.

449
00:44:29,719 --> 00:44:32,711
Why don't you scream?
Don't you dare?

450
00:44:32,955 --> 00:44:34,980
Now I know why you've come.

451
00:44:35,191 --> 00:44:37,751
If I scream,
they will find you here

452
00:44:38,127 --> 00:44:40,687
and Catalina will know
you've been in my room.

453
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:44,491
You only want to make her jealous,
but she won't come.

454
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,234
She's locked in
and won't see anybody.

455
00:44:47,537 --> 00:44:50,597
- I came to see you.
- You're lying.

456
00:44:50,907 --> 00:44:53,171
I'm telling you I came to see you.

457
00:44:53,809 --> 00:44:55,504
- I cannot believe you
- Why?

458
00:44:55,845 --> 00:44:57,813
Because you only love her.

459
00:44:58,447 --> 00:45:00,745
I loved her, but
I also hated her.

460
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:04,784
I can't stand this Ioneliness.
You've shown me something else.

461
00:45:04,987 --> 00:45:07,080
I wish I could believe you.

462
00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:11,556
But you want to forget her with me.
Forget her!

463
00:45:11,761 --> 00:45:14,594
She's forgotten.
I swear, Isabel.

464
00:45:42,525 --> 00:45:45,460
Sir, come upstairs right away!
It's Mistress!

465
00:46:00,309 --> 00:46:04,803
- Catalina, what's the matter?
- I want to die!

466
00:46:05,581 --> 00:46:07,173
Help me with her.

467
00:46:09,085 --> 00:46:10,484
I'll go anyway!

468
00:46:10,753 --> 00:46:12,243
- Why didn't you say she was ill?
- I didn't know it.

469
00:46:12,455 --> 00:46:17,085
I came to see how she was
and found her lying on the floor.

470
00:46:17,293 --> 00:46:19,784
- Your gossip started all this!
- It's all right.

471
00:46:19,996 --> 00:46:22,226
If that man comes here
to woo your wife and you sister,

472
00:46:22,431 --> 00:46:24,365
I won't breathe a word!

473
00:46:25,801 --> 00:46:29,202
It's me, Catalina.
I didn't know that you were sick.

474
00:46:29,905 --> 00:46:31,805
Send for the doctor.

475
00:46:32,008 --> 00:46:33,999
Hurry!
That's the best you can do.

476
00:47:22,358 --> 00:47:23,791
Sir!

477
00:47:27,163 --> 00:47:28,562
Come a second.

478
00:47:49,418 --> 00:47:52,410
- She eloped with him.
- You'll bring her back.

479
00:47:52,621 --> 00:47:55,852
No. Nobody can deal with him.

480
00:47:56,959 --> 00:47:59,120
She'll pay a high price for this.

481
00:47:59,762 --> 00:48:02,424
She will not set foot
in this house again! Understand!

482
00:48:03,799 --> 00:48:04,959
For me, she's dead.

483
00:48:05,167 --> 00:48:06,828
Will you let her
stay with that man?

484
00:48:07,036 --> 00:48:08,867
She chose it.

485
00:48:09,572 --> 00:48:11,164
Come on, Maria.

486
00:48:12,408 --> 00:48:15,809
You alone will help me
take care of her.

487
00:48:40,503 --> 00:48:43,472
- What's the matter?
- I'm very happy, Alejandro.

488
00:48:44,907 --> 00:48:46,670
This is no time for kissing.

489
00:48:46,876 --> 00:48:50,107
- Alejandro, do you love me?
- Very much. Come on.

490
00:48:50,346 --> 00:48:52,109
Be happy and have many children.

491
00:48:52,581 --> 00:48:55,243
May you be very lucky
and healthy.

492
00:48:55,451 --> 00:48:57,578
We have good hearts and need help.

493
00:48:57,787 --> 00:48:59,254
Let's go.

494
00:49:13,335 --> 00:49:15,701
- How are you, sir?
- Fine. 

495
00:49:15,905 --> 00:49:17,873
- How is everything here?
- Everything is fine.

496
00:49:18,073 --> 00:49:19,438
- Is it all right?
- Very well, boss.  

497
00:49:22,812 --> 00:49:24,211
Come on, get down.

498
00:49:34,323 --> 00:49:35,915
Jorgito, come here!

499
00:49:55,244 --> 00:49:56,404
How's everything?

500
00:49:56,612 --> 00:50:01,811
Thank God and the Blessed Virgin,
everything is peaceful these days.

501
00:50:02,017 --> 00:50:05,612
I told you not to put that bench 
there. It doesn't belong here.

502
00:50:05,888 --> 00:50:07,116
Jorgito!

503
00:50:07,323 --> 00:50:09,450
One can't even work in peace.

504
00:50:09,658 --> 00:50:11,956
- Take this.
- Jorgito, give me a kiss.

505
00:50:12,161 --> 00:50:13,685
Don't come near me!

506
00:50:13,963 --> 00:50:15,794
What are you doing here?
Come on!

507
00:50:32,748 --> 00:50:36,206
You won't be sleeping here.
José will show you to your room.

508
00:50:36,785 --> 00:50:38,013
Go!

509
00:50:48,264 --> 00:50:54,066
Go ahead.
All that peace couldn't last.

510
00:50:54,570 --> 00:50:57,937
I don't know what is going to happen
with that devil in the house.

511
00:50:58,641 --> 00:51:03,408
As the saying goes: "To the blind dog,
everything seems like flies."

512
00:51:04,547 --> 00:51:08,677
Where the hell are you going?
This way.

513
00:51:21,196 --> 00:51:25,098
And try not to talk too much.
Master doesn't like it.

514
00:52:21,023 --> 00:52:22,752
Thank you, I don't want any.

515
00:52:23,926 --> 00:52:26,019
As if you were a princess.

516
00:52:26,395 --> 00:52:29,853
You can't be dificult here.
You must learn to eat whatever there is.

517
00:53:21,984 --> 00:53:23,144
Where are you going, Ricardo?

518
00:53:28,123 --> 00:53:29,818
What do you want?

519
00:53:35,964 --> 00:53:39,024
Idiot! Where are you going?
It has nothing to do with you.

520
00:54:06,028 --> 00:54:09,225
Let's leave this house.
I don't want to stay here!

521
00:54:09,431 --> 00:54:10,830
Leave me alone.

522
00:54:13,168 --> 00:54:15,659
What have I done
for you to treat me this way?

523
00:54:16,138 --> 00:54:18,936
You've brought me here
where nobody likes me.

524
00:54:19,675 --> 00:54:23,839
If you still have any love for me,
take me away from this house.

525
00:54:25,447 --> 00:54:27,176
Love for you?

526
00:54:28,283 --> 00:54:32,811
Have you seen spiders under a rock?
You step on it and crush them.

527
00:54:33,856 --> 00:54:35,414
That's what I'll do to you.

528
00:54:38,861 --> 00:54:43,355
But I still love you, Alejandro.
I've never done you any harm.

529
00:54:44,166 --> 00:54:48,432
I hate you simply because you are.
You have his blood.

530
00:54:48,737 --> 00:54:50,967
If you don't love me anymore,
let me go.

531
00:54:51,173 --> 00:54:53,300
You'll never hear from me again.

532
00:54:53,809 --> 00:54:56,243
You wanted to be my wife
and so it shall be.

533
00:54:56,445 --> 00:54:57,571
You'll remain here ... 

534
00:54:57,780 --> 00:54:59,748
to cook for me
and wash my clothes.

535
00:54:59,948 --> 00:55:02,542
And you won't leave this house
until I say so.

536
00:55:14,830 --> 00:55:17,355
You let yourself get trapped, idiot.

537
00:55:17,566 --> 00:55:20,967
You'd deserve
to be beaten to a pulp by him.

538
00:55:21,203 --> 00:55:25,071
I don't like you,
but I feel sorry for you.

539
00:55:25,841 --> 00:55:28,469
Don't be afraid.
I won't eat you up.

540
00:55:29,444 --> 00:55:31,878
We can finish this business
once and for all.

541
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:33,547
What will you do?

542
00:55:34,850 --> 00:55:39,685
Every night I go up to his room
and the door is locked.

543
00:55:40,389 --> 00:55:41,981
Well locked …

544
00:55:42,991 --> 00:55:45,186
but one of these days
he'll forget it.

545
00:55:47,596 --> 00:55:49,996
Perhaps tonight...

546
00:55:58,373 --> 00:56:00,068
For heaven's sake, don't!

547
00:56:00,375 --> 00:56:03,708
Why don't you kill him?
You must hate him more than I do.

548
00:56:23,999 --> 00:56:27,196
Isabel! Idiot!
Where are you?

549
00:56:28,503 --> 00:56:30,368
I need you.

550
00:57:41,610 --> 00:57:45,307
IsabeI, The state you're in!

551
00:57:47,416 --> 00:57:49,680
What's the matter?

552
00:57:49,985 --> 00:57:53,216
I walked all night.
I want to see my brother.

553
00:57:53,422 --> 00:57:54,650
He's out. Besides,

554
00:57:54,856 --> 00:57:58,451
I don't know if he wants to see you.
You know him.

555
00:57:58,727 --> 00:57:59,921
Then I'll see Catalina.

556
00:58:00,128 --> 00:58:02,119
Wait! She's very ill.

557
00:58:02,798 --> 00:58:06,757
I must speak to her, Maria.
I must talk to someone.

558
00:58:09,638 --> 00:58:11,071
Come.

559
00:58:18,914 --> 00:58:21,474
- Catalina!
- How are you, Isabel?

560
00:58:21,683 --> 00:58:23,617
As you can see.

561
00:58:23,852 --> 00:58:26,878
I'm not surprised to see you
like this. I can imagine it all.

562
00:58:27,289 --> 00:58:28,722
Sit down.

563
00:58:29,091 --> 00:58:31,116
I'll watch for Master.

564
00:58:32,194 --> 00:58:36,028
You must speak to Eduardo, Catalina.
He must allow me to come back here.

565
00:58:37,165 --> 00:58:41,966
I can't stay on the farm.
If you knew all I've been through.

566
00:58:42,371 --> 00:58:45,067
I've told you
I can imagine all of it.

567
00:58:45,273 --> 00:58:47,764
Then you'll speak to Eduardo?
Will you tell him...

568
00:58:47,976 --> 00:58:50,638
I won't tell him a thing.
It would be useless.

569
00:58:50,846 --> 00:58:53,337
But I'm his sister,
he has to protect me.

570
00:58:53,548 --> 00:58:56,642
We warned you in time,
but you wouldn't listen.

571
00:58:56,885 --> 00:58:58,546
How could I know?

572
00:58:59,821 --> 00:59:02,915
I thought you opposed to our relationship
because you were jealous.

573
00:59:04,192 --> 00:59:05,887
Jealous of whom?

574
00:59:06,194 --> 00:59:11,359
I can't be jealous of him.
It would be like being jealous of myself.

575
00:59:12,901 --> 00:59:17,804
The advice I gave you was impartial.
Alejandro has never loved you.

576
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:21,741
I know it. That's why I don't want
to go back to him.

577
00:59:22,210 --> 00:59:26,271
Please, speak to my brother.
He'll listen to you. Speak to him.

578
00:59:50,972 --> 00:59:54,135
How are you, Cathy?
You're looking better.

579
00:59:55,310 --> 00:59:57,244
Tell me that you feel perfectly well.

580
00:59:58,346 --> 01:00:01,474
- What's the matter?
- Isabel is back.

581
01:00:03,452 --> 01:00:05,010
Isabel has come back?

582
01:00:05,220 --> 01:00:07,154
She's waiting for you
in Maria's room.

583
01:00:26,708 --> 01:00:30,337
Poor Miss Isabel.
You are the best one, after all.

584
01:00:31,179 --> 01:00:33,739
Until he came, we were in peace,
then everyone turned evil.

585
01:00:33,949 --> 01:00:37,112
Everyone is selfish just like him.

586
01:00:47,529 --> 01:00:51,431
The carriage will soon be ready.
You must return to the farm right away.

587
01:00:51,633 --> 01:00:52,691
Eduardo.

588
01:00:52,901 --> 01:00:57,702
I wasn't the one who made you marry him.
A married woman belongs with her husband.

589
01:00:58,540 --> 01:01:03,637
When you see me like this,
don't you realize I can't stay there?

590
01:01:04,913 --> 01:01:06,346
Leave!

591
01:01:08,583 --> 01:01:10,244
You shouldn't have come.

592
01:01:10,452 --> 01:01:14,445
You knew he's the man
I hate most in the world.

593
01:01:14,656 --> 01:01:18,148
But you still eloped with him.
Why didn't you think twice?
Why did you deceive me?

594
01:01:18,827 --> 01:01:22,160
If I let you come back to this house,
he'll come for you...

595
01:01:22,898 --> 01:01:27,198
And I don't want to see him again.
So now you know.

596
01:01:27,702 --> 01:01:32,036
Eduardo, I beg you.
I know I was wrong.

597
01:01:33,475 --> 01:01:37,206
For the sake of our parents' memory,
let me come to you again.

598
01:01:38,046 --> 01:01:39,479
It's useless, Isabel.

599
01:01:44,753 --> 01:01:48,211
I'll leave now.
But let me tell you one thing.

600
01:01:48,423 --> 01:01:50,254
He'll wind up stealing her from you,
dead or alive.

601
01:01:50,458 --> 01:01:53,985
That will be your punishment!

602
01:01:59,334 --> 01:02:02,167
Sir, forgive her,
she's only a child.

603
01:02:03,038 --> 01:02:06,303
I don't want anybody
to mention her to me again.

604
01:02:22,624 --> 01:02:25,354
Maria, Catalina has fainted.

605
01:02:28,597 --> 01:02:30,394
Let's take her inside.

606
01:03:09,404 --> 01:03:10,803
Where's that wine?

607
01:03:18,213 --> 01:03:21,080
Hunting on Sunday: The one who kills
the youngest pays a fine.

608
01:03:21,283 --> 01:03:24,844
Yesterday we killed 28 rabbits
and none of them was pregnant.

609
01:03:25,053 --> 01:03:26,281
I'm not like you.

610
01:03:26,488 --> 01:03:29,548
I go out everyday
and shoot whatever jumps.

611
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:35,061
Alejandro, I need more money.

612
01:03:36,564 --> 01:03:38,293
I have to make up for my losses.

613
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:40,297
You don't have any collateral left.

614
01:03:40,502 --> 01:03:42,265
You're a thief!

615
01:03:45,874 --> 01:03:48,342
Give me a little.
Just a little, that's all.

616
01:03:56,051 --> 01:03:57,712
What are you doing there?

617
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:02,620
You'll get indigestion and then,
I will pay for the consequences.

618
01:04:04,326 --> 01:04:08,126
Don't worry, pretty one,
we never shoot females.

619
01:04:08,330 --> 01:04:11,265
Leave her alone!
You think she's a maid!

620
01:04:11,466 --> 01:04:14,833
Get out, all of you!
You have taken away everything.

621
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:17,731
There is nothing left.
Out!

622
01:04:18,173 --> 01:04:22,269
Be careful, Ricardo.
You're drunk, but so am I.

623
01:04:22,477 --> 01:04:25,241
No fights. Let's leave
and never set foot here again.

624
01:04:25,613 --> 01:04:29,049
Leave right now!
You are in my house. You hear?

625
01:04:29,250 --> 01:04:32,879
No more card games.
I don't want you to come back ever.

626
01:04:33,455 --> 01:04:34,786
Serves us right.

627
01:04:35,023 --> 01:04:37,617
We shouldn't come
play in certain places.

628
01:04:37,826 --> 01:04:40,989
I can assure you I will never
set foot in this house again.

629
01:04:41,196 --> 01:04:42,595
Neither will I.

630
01:04:47,635 --> 01:04:49,660
Thank you for defending me, Ricardo.

631
01:04:49,871 --> 01:04:52,863
Leave me alone.
I'm not your defender.

632
01:04:53,541 --> 01:04:55,168
Go and open the door.

633
01:05:01,816 --> 01:05:07,482
Sir, you know my brother.
Don't tell him you've seen me like this.

634
01:05:07,689 --> 01:05:08,815
Don't worry. 

635
01:05:09,023 --> 01:05:11,821
Besides, I couldn't,
he's always with his wife.

636
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:14,492
- How is Catalina?
- Very bad.

637
01:05:18,366 --> 01:05:19,833
What did you say?

638
01:05:20,335 --> 01:05:23,395
I said that woman has
very little time left to live.

639
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:10,977
Come here.
What are you waiting for?

640
01:07:15,216 --> 01:07:16,205
Come on!

641
01:07:42,110 --> 01:07:46,843
Don Mariano, you can tell me the truth.
I saw her at birth.

642
01:07:47,081 --> 01:07:49,208
I'm like a second mother to her.

643
01:07:49,417 --> 01:07:50,543
Will she live?

644
01:07:50,752 --> 01:07:54,347
She's very weak.
It all depends on how the birth goes.

645
01:07:54,556 --> 01:07:59,118
Anyway, send for me immediately
if anything changes.

646
01:08:11,306 --> 01:08:14,400
I'm very happy. 
You heard the doctor.

647
01:08:14,609 --> 01:08:17,942
- Everything will be alright.
- I don't like it when you lie to me.

648
01:08:18,146 --> 01:08:20,273
You are all lying to me.

649
01:08:21,115 --> 01:08:24,278
I know I won't survive
the birth of my child,

650
01:08:24,752 --> 01:08:25,946
but I'm not afraid.

651
01:08:26,154 --> 01:08:27,985
Why do you insist on torturing me?

652
01:08:28,523 --> 01:08:31,492
Why don't you ask
why I insist on having black hair

653
01:08:31,993 --> 01:08:35,520
or on being a woman.
I can't help it.

654
01:08:36,531 --> 01:08:39,022
When the time comes,
don't be sorry.

655
01:08:39,233 --> 01:08:42,930
If you leave me, I won't bear it.

656
01:08:44,005 --> 01:08:45,472
I'm cold.

657
01:09:20,875 --> 01:09:24,140
Maria, I want to see Catalina
for the last time.

658
01:09:24,345 --> 01:09:26,438
- Tell her I want to see her.
- I won't.

659
01:09:26,648 --> 01:09:30,311
Then I'll come in the house by force.
Who are you to stop me?

660
01:09:30,518 --> 01:09:32,611
Nobody has ever loved her like I.

661
01:09:32,954 --> 01:09:34,649
I must see her before she dies.

662
01:09:34,856 --> 01:09:37,882
For weeks nobody has wanted
to tell me anything about her.

663
01:09:38,092 --> 01:09:39,923
Master never leaves her.

664
01:09:40,128 --> 01:09:43,791
Find a way to get rid of him.
You must help me see her!

665
01:09:44,098 --> 01:09:45,725
Leave the doors open. 

666
01:09:45,933 --> 01:09:47,867
Go tell her,
I want her to be warned.

667
01:10:25,406 --> 01:10:28,773
- Where is Master?
- I convinced him to sleep a few hours.

668
01:10:28,976 --> 01:10:31,103
He hasn't slept too many nights.

669
01:10:33,314 --> 01:10:36,374
Catalina,
someone is coming to see you.

670
01:10:40,154 --> 01:10:41,644
Alejandro!

671
01:10:43,024 --> 01:10:46,960
Why didn't you tell me sooner?
You did it on purpose!

672
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:48,956
You're always against me.

673
01:10:50,498 --> 01:10:52,557
Hurry, bring my vanity case.

674
01:10:52,767 --> 01:10:55,600
I want to do myself up.
I must be very pale.

675
01:11:02,810 --> 01:11:04,778
Go away, Maria!
Leave us alone.

676
01:11:32,707 --> 01:11:36,973
My darling.
Why have you come back this late?

677
01:11:37,178 --> 01:11:40,773
Catalina!
I've come to never leave you again.

678
01:11:42,150 --> 01:11:43,811
We have little time left.

679
01:11:46,053 --> 01:11:49,887
I would like to hold you like this
until we both die.

680
01:12:04,305 --> 01:12:07,331
How long do you intend to live
after I'm gone?

681
01:12:08,576 --> 01:12:11,044
How long until you forget me?

682
01:12:11,379 --> 01:12:13,677
Don't torment me, Catalina.

683
01:12:13,881 --> 01:12:16,475
You are responsible for my death.

684
01:12:16,851 --> 01:12:19,342
I don't pity you if you stay alone.

685
01:12:21,022 --> 01:12:24,116
I know it makes you happy to think
that I'll writhe in a horrible hell

686
01:12:24,859 --> 01:12:26,656
while you'll be resting in peace.

687
01:12:27,261 --> 01:12:29,286
I won't be able to rest in peace.

688
01:12:30,198 --> 01:12:32,928
In the ground,
I'll sufer as much as you.

689
01:12:33,167 --> 01:12:36,227
You have done me great harm.
I'll never forgive you.

690
01:12:37,238 --> 01:12:41,834
I've been to blame for loving you
so much. You love me that way too.

691
01:12:42,043 --> 01:12:45,444
But I don't care. I'll take
the Alejandro I love with me.

692
01:12:45,646 --> 01:12:47,477
Why have you been so cruel?

693
01:12:47,682 --> 01:12:51,618
You've done what no one else
was able to do: Destroy our love.

694
01:12:51,986 --> 01:12:54,477
You abandoned me
and I don't blame you.

695
01:12:55,957 --> 01:12:58,983
My love,
I want to die with you.

696
01:13:02,597 --> 01:13:05,395
-Alejandro!
-Catalina!

697
01:13:20,281 --> 01:13:23,341
Don't go, my love.
Don't leave me ever again.

698
01:13:35,897 --> 01:13:37,262
Just take care of her now.

699
01:13:37,465 --> 01:13:41,367
You can find me
whenever you wish.

700
01:13:44,238 --> 01:13:45,364
Maria!

701
01:13:57,485 --> 01:14:02,889
Sir, she needs you.
The moment has come.

702
01:14:05,326 --> 01:14:08,193
What are you doing there?
Go get the doctor immediately!

703
01:14:49,804 --> 01:14:52,739
Dry your tears
because she won't need them.

704
01:14:52,940 --> 01:14:54,737
Let the devil take us all.

705
01:14:55,710 --> 01:14:58,736
- How did she die?
- After her child was born.

706
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:01,942
- A handsome boy.
- Never mind the boy.

707
01:15:02,650 --> 01:15:04,948
Did she say my name
before she died?

708
01:15:05,152 --> 01:15:09,316
She never regained consciousness.
I hope she wakes up in glory.

709
01:15:09,523 --> 01:15:11,787
I hope she wakes up in hell!

710
01:15:18,499 --> 01:15:22,629
Catalina,
I'm going to say a prayer for you

711
01:15:24,238 --> 01:15:26,468
until my tongue goes dry.

712
01:15:27,174 --> 01:15:31,406
Catalina, I hope you don't have
any peace while I live.

713
01:15:32,313 --> 01:15:34,372
You said that I killed you

714
01:15:34,682 --> 01:15:37,446
and the dead haunt their assassins.

715
01:15:37,852 --> 01:15:40,980
Haunt me.
Make me crazy.

716
01:15:41,722 --> 01:15:45,556
But don't leave me alone.
Don't leave me in this abyss.

717
01:15:47,094 --> 01:15:52,691
Catalina, show yourself.
Come back to curse me.

718
01:15:53,667 --> 01:15:55,328
Catalina!

719
01:17:00,601 --> 01:17:06,767
"For the ungodly have said,
reasoning with themselves but not right.

720
01:17:07,007 --> 01:17:11,501
"The time of our life is short
and tedious

721
01:17:11,712 --> 01:17:14,180
"and in the end of a man,
there is no remedy,

722
01:17:14,381 --> 01:17:16,747
"and no man hath been known

723
01:17:16,951 --> 01:17:20,148
"to have returned from hell

724
01:17:20,354 --> 01:17:21,685
"or from the other world.

725
01:17:22,022 --> 01:17:26,288
"For we are born from nothing

726
01:17:26,694 --> 01:17:29,822
"and after this,

727
01:17:30,464 --> 01:17:34,400
"we shall be as if we had not been.

728
01:17:34,835 --> 01:17:36,666
"For the breath in our nostrils

729
01:17:36,904 --> 01:17:41,807
"is smoke,

730
01:17:42,009 --> 01:17:44,671
"and speech a spark
to move our heart,

731
01:17:45,079 --> 01:17:49,709
"which being put out,
our body shall be ashes

732
01:17:49,917 --> 01:17:53,478
"and our spirit shall be
poured abroad as soft air,

733
01:17:53,687 --> 01:17:56,485
"and our life shall pass away
as the trace of a cloud

734
01:17:56,690 --> 01:18:01,150
"and be dispersed as mist, which is
driven away by the sun beams,

735
01:18:01,362 --> 01:18:03,353
"and overpowered with the heat.

736
01:18:03,564 --> 01:18:07,022
"And our name in time
shall be forgotten,

737
01:18:07,234 --> 01:18:10,067
"and no man shall have
any remembrance of our works."

738
01:18:10,304 --> 01:18:14,240
Drop your bloody book now!
And take that one to bed!

739
01:18:14,441 --> 01:18:15,931
We want to be alone.

740
01:18:16,143 --> 01:18:19,169
One can't even read the Lord's Book.

741
01:18:19,380 --> 01:18:23,749
And poor Mistress didn't have
a prayer said for her in this house.

742
01:18:25,119 --> 01:18:31,388
Son, wake up.
Her soul will call for amends to be made.

743
01:18:31,759 --> 01:18:35,456
May the Lord forgive her
and forgive us all.

744
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:43,429
He has to come back sometime
or perhaps the earth swallowed him?

745
01:18:43,737 --> 01:18:46,706
He's been away for 3 days
without eating or sleeping.

746
01:18:46,907 --> 01:18:50,399
He has been seen from afar.
He must have gone crazy.

747
01:18:50,611 --> 01:18:53,876
Or perhaps he went to lay on her tomb
like a faithful dog.

748
01:18:54,081 --> 01:18:56,777
Let him come, to beat us all up,

749
01:18:56,984 --> 01:18:59,179
or shoot himself in his room...

750
01:18:59,386 --> 01:19:00,512
But let him come!

751
01:19:00,721 --> 01:19:03,485
You're afraid of him.
You don't want to confess it.

752
01:19:03,691 --> 01:19:05,249
But you're afraid of him.

753
01:19:05,659 --> 01:19:08,389
And you're not afraid of him.

754
01:19:08,596 --> 01:19:11,087
I don't know...

755
01:19:12,066 --> 01:19:16,560
If he should come tonight,
he might break his neck in the ravine.

756
01:19:16,837 --> 01:19:20,933
Everything would be over
and we would rest once and for all.

757
01:19:23,043 --> 01:19:25,307
We can kill him when he comes here.

758
01:19:25,512 --> 01:19:28,879
I have the key to his room.
He forgot it.

759
01:19:36,924 --> 01:19:41,088
He'll go with Catalina.
It will rain on their bodies.

760
01:19:41,495 --> 01:19:43,793
That will be the end of it all.

761
01:19:45,165 --> 01:19:49,761
I've already told you, idiot.
I'm sure he cheats on you on her tomb.

762
01:19:51,071 --> 01:19:55,565
You're nothing. Your husband 
cheats on you with a dead woman!

763
01:19:56,443 --> 01:19:59,776
A dry shot to the heart.

764
01:20:00,781 --> 01:20:04,478
No.
A black hole between his eyes.

765
01:20:07,521 --> 01:20:09,386
Will you help me, Isabel?

766
01:20:10,357 --> 01:20:13,326
What do you want?
How shall I help you?

767
01:20:13,527 --> 01:20:18,157
We'll kill him together.
I'll never be able to do it alone.

768
01:20:18,599 --> 01:20:22,330
We have to put an end to him.
You must hate him more than I do.

769
01:20:23,270 --> 01:20:25,738
I'll explain what we must do.

770
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:29,498
No, I don't want to.
He's stronger.

771
01:20:29,843 --> 01:20:32,505
When he finds out
you want to kill him...

772
01:20:33,447 --> 01:20:36,610
IsabeI, José!
Open up, you wretched!

773
01:20:36,817 --> 01:20:38,808
Open up!
Now or never.

774
01:20:39,019 --> 01:20:40,316
Open up.

775
01:20:43,190 --> 01:20:45,784
That scoundrel knocks
as if he owned the place.

776
01:20:47,695 --> 01:20:51,062
You'd better open.
Then we'll be rid of him in a second.

777
01:20:52,433 --> 01:20:55,129
José, Open it now!

778
01:20:55,402 --> 01:20:57,666
I don't want you to kill him.
He's my husband.

779
01:20:57,871 --> 01:21:00,669
You're repulsive!
Don't change your mind.

780
01:21:06,647 --> 01:21:09,343
Go away, Alejandro!
Your life depends on it.

781
01:21:09,550 --> 01:21:11,040
You'd better open up, you bitch!

782
01:21:11,251 --> 01:21:14,345
And still you insult me.
You are a brute without a heart.

783
01:21:14,555 --> 01:21:17,922
Go back to her now.
Shoot yourself over her tomb.

784
01:21:18,125 --> 01:21:19,353
Open it, Isabel!

785
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:23,121
I won't open.
I told you Ricardo wants to kill you.

786
01:21:39,413 --> 01:21:42,041
Don't Alejandro. Please!

787
01:21:42,316 --> 01:21:43,715
No, Alejandro, don't!

788
01:22:55,956 --> 01:22:59,687
"These things they thought
and were deceived,

789
01:23:00,127 --> 01:23:03,062
"for their own malice blinded them."

790
01:23:08,769 --> 01:23:12,762
Don't you know how to eat?
Why didn't you put the bib on?

791
01:23:24,084 --> 01:23:27,679
Is she already gone?
I'm talking to you.

792
01:23:27,888 --> 01:23:29,981
I took her in the carriage myself.

793
01:23:30,190 --> 01:23:34,320
And her brother took her in.
Sure, they're the same.

794
01:23:34,528 --> 01:23:36,655
They held each other crying.

795
01:23:36,930 --> 01:23:41,162
She will be alright there.
Better than in this house of the devil.

796
01:23:42,603 --> 01:23:45,629
May everything be
through God's grace.

797
01:23:47,107 --> 01:23:50,941
He stayed in his room all day,

798
01:23:51,345 --> 01:23:53,404
crying and calling for her out loud.

799
01:23:53,614 --> 01:23:58,051
Then he left through that door
looking like a doomed man.

800
01:23:58,252 --> 01:24:00,243
God save us from him.

801
01:24:11,298 --> 01:24:14,756
"Let none of us
go without his part in luxury

802
01:24:15,569 --> 01:24:19,471
"and let us everywhere
leave tokens of joy

803
01:24:19,773 --> 01:24:23,800
"for this is our portion
and our lot.

804
01:24:24,177 --> 01:24:27,374
"And they knew not
the secrets of God,

805
01:24:27,581 --> 01:24:33,315
"who created man incorruptible
and to the image of his likeness made him.

806
01:24:33,587 --> 01:24:38,149
"But by the envy of the devil,
death came into the world.

807
01:24:38,358 --> 01:24:42,294
"And they follow him
that are of his side."

808
01:28:38,732 --> 01:28:39,790
Alejandro!

809
01:28:40,305 --> 01:29:40,261
