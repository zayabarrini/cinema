00:00:34,584 --> 00:00:37,584
THE DISCREET CHARM
OF THE BOURGEOISIE

4
00:02:26,501 --> 00:02:29,293
- Should I wait, your Excellency?
- Yes.

5
00:03:04,334 --> 00:03:05,709
Good evening.

6
00:03:08,668 --> 00:03:11,209
The fire isn't lit.

7
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:16,418
And the table isn't set.

8
00:03:16,584 --> 00:03:18,584
Yet it's past eight o'clock.

9
00:03:20,626 --> 00:03:23,043
Good evening, dear Alice.

10
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:25,126
Don Raphael!
How are you?

11
00:03:25,293 --> 00:03:26,501
I'm fine.

12
00:03:26,668 --> 00:03:28,751
Delighted to see you again.

13
00:03:28,918 --> 00:03:31,543
Good evening.

14
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:33,459
What a surprise …

15
00:03:34,251 --> 00:03:36,376
to see you tonight!

16
00:03:36,543 --> 00:03:39,793
- You didn't expect us?
- Not tonight.

17
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:41,001
Not tonight?

18
00:03:41,168 --> 00:03:44,668
I was expecting you tomorrow.

19
00:03:44,834 --> 00:03:46,834
- Tomorrow?
- Yes.

20
00:03:47,001 --> 00:03:49,876
But Henri made it for tonight.

21
00:03:50,043 --> 00:03:51,501
I'm positive.

22
00:03:52,293 --> 00:03:54,501
That's impossible.

23
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:58,334
Henri is out
attending a business dinner.

24
00:03:58,501 --> 00:03:59,584
That's surprising.

25
00:03:59,751 --> 00:04:02,001
I was there when he invited us.

26
00:04:02,168 --> 00:04:05,376
Anyway, tomorrow I'm busy.

27
00:04:06,376 --> 00:04:08,293
I couldn't have accepted.

28
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:10,626
I'm dining at the Colombian Embassy.

29
00:04:10,793 --> 00:04:14,209
I really don't know what to say.

30
00:04:15,834 --> 00:04:17,876
I'd ask you to share my dinner,

31
00:04:18,043 --> 00:04:20,334
only I have nothing ready.

32
00:04:20,876 --> 00:04:21,876
I really am sorry.

33
00:04:22,043 --> 00:04:24,293
Don't be sorry.
It doesn't matter.

34
00:04:24,459 --> 00:04:26,459
A slight misunderstanding.

35
00:04:26,626 --> 00:04:28,251
Won't you sit down

36
00:04:28,418 --> 00:04:30,793
and have a drink?
- Yes. No?

37
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:35,084
Don't trouble yourself.
We're off.

38
00:04:35,251 --> 00:04:38,543
By the way, I know a very nice inn
a few miles away.

39
00:04:38,709 --> 00:04:41,293
I ate there once or twice.

40
00:04:41,459 --> 00:04:43,834
- Come as my guest.
- Good idea.

41
00:04:44,001 --> 00:04:45,709
Won't you come along?

42
00:04:45,876 --> 00:04:48,043
You're sweet, but I'm not dressed.

43
00:04:48,209 --> 00:04:51,626
Don't worry.
It's a very informal place.

44
00:04:52,418 --> 00:04:53,834
I'll still go and change.

45
00:04:54,001 --> 00:04:56,459
No, come as you are.

46
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:40,959
Not very cheerful.

47
00:05:41,126 --> 00:05:42,751
Put that on, Alice.

48
00:05:42,918 --> 00:05:44,918
Maybe it's closed.

49
00:05:45,084 --> 00:05:48,084
I'll find out.

50
00:05:48,251 --> 00:05:50,793
Doesn't look too good.

51
00:05:51,001 --> 00:05:52,626
Shall I throw it away?

52
00:06:01,084 --> 00:06:02,168
What's up?

53
00:06:02,334 --> 00:06:04,709
- Is the restaurant closed?
- No, Sir.

54
00:06:04,876 --> 00:06:05,834
May we come in?

55
00:06:06,001 --> 00:06:07,626
Of course. One moment.

56
00:06:07,793 --> 00:06:09,376
What does this mean?

57
00:06:09,543 --> 00:06:12,126
Call the proprietor, Mr Manuel.

58
00:06:12,293 --> 00:06:14,959
There's new management.

59
00:06:15,126 --> 00:06:17,876
Then good night, Madam.

60
00:06:18,043 --> 00:06:20,251
No, do come in.

61
00:06:20,418 --> 00:06:21,626
Let's go in.

62
00:06:30,918 --> 00:06:32,376
It's not crowded.

63
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:37,043
- A bad sign.
- Maybe it's too early.

64
00:06:37,209 --> 00:06:38,668
Shall we sit here?

65
00:06:44,126 --> 00:06:45,709
You go there.

66
00:06:50,584 --> 00:06:53,501
Let's start with the wine.

67
00:06:53,668 --> 00:06:55,376
It depends on what we order.

68
00:06:55,543 --> 00:06:58,418
What do you like?
Claret? Burgundy?

69
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,334
Burgundy.

70
00:07:00,501 --> 00:07:03,626
Even if I eat oysters or fish,

71
00:07:03,793 --> 00:07:05,126
I prefer red wine.

72
00:07:05,293 --> 00:07:06,501
Well?

73
00:07:11,251 --> 00:07:13,959
Snails Chablis style.

74
00:07:14,126 --> 00:07:15,834
I don't like snails.

75
00:07:16,001 --> 00:07:18,001
I fancy hare pâté,

76
00:07:18,168 --> 00:07:23,334
but in restaurants,
it's always too salty.

77
00:07:24,334 --> 00:07:26,626
There's melon.

78
00:07:26,793 --> 00:07:29,876
Good idea.
I'll have melon with port.

79
00:07:33,084 --> 00:07:36,001
I'd have caviar,
but it might be of poor quality

80
00:07:36,168 --> 00:07:39,501
and in small helpings.
I like mine better.

81
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:41,418
What fish is there?

82
00:07:41,584 --> 00:07:43,334
I'm fond of fish.

83
00:07:43,501 --> 00:07:46,501
Grilled sardines, filet of sole,

84
00:07:46,668 --> 00:07:49,126
fried whiting, brown buttered skate,

85
00:07:49,293 --> 00:07:52,584
quenelles of pike Nantua style,
boiled trout …

86
00:07:52,751 --> 00:07:54,668
It's not expensive here.

87
00:07:54,834 --> 00:07:57,626
Cheap, and no customers,
that's weird.

88
00:07:57,793 --> 00:07:59,126
Think so?

89
00:07:59,709 --> 00:08:03,126
Then I'll forget about the melon
and have a dry martini.

90
00:08:03,293 --> 00:08:05,751
Out of the question.
Red wine, that's all …

91
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:07,043
if that.

92
00:08:07,209 --> 00:08:10,168
And a good Crémant to please Picard.

93
00:08:18,668 --> 00:08:21,168
- What's all this?
- Where are you off to?

94
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,543
Stay here.

95
00:08:22,876 --> 00:08:24,876
You shouldn't pry.

96
00:08:28,834 --> 00:08:30,543
So, we'll have …

97
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:34,376
one melon with port,
one melon …

98
00:08:34,543 --> 00:08:38,543
One rollmops …

99
00:08:49,043 --> 00:08:50,709
What's this?

100
00:08:50,876 --> 00:08:54,001
It's the proprietor.
He died suddenly this afternoon.

101
00:08:54,168 --> 00:08:55,709
We all loved him.

102
00:08:55,876 --> 00:08:59,001
- He died in that suit?
- Why do you keep him there?

103
00:08:59,168 --> 00:09:02,168
We're expecting the undertaker.

104
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:04,418
Of course,
we remain at your service.

105
00:09:04,584 --> 00:09:06,876
No, I'm off.
I don't want to eat here.

106
00:09:07,043 --> 00:09:08,251
But why?

107
00:09:08,418 --> 00:09:10,626
Raphael, are you crazy?

108
00:09:10,793 --> 00:09:11,626
I don't mind.

109
00:09:11,793 --> 00:09:14,959
I can assure you that
you'll have an excellent dinner.

110
00:09:15,126 --> 00:09:18,251
- I'm leaving.
- As you like.

111
00:09:18,418 --> 00:09:20,918
- And where do we go?
- Somewhere else.

112
00:09:21,084 --> 00:09:24,626
If you don't mind, I'll go home.
Can you give me a lift?

113
00:09:24,793 --> 00:09:27,001
With pleasure.

114
00:09:42,126 --> 00:09:45,834
<i>Republic of Miranda</i>
<i>Embassy</i>

115
00:10:01,126 --> 00:10:02,251
Yes?

116
00:10:02,418 --> 00:10:05,501
<i>Mr Sénéchal and Mr Thévenot are here.</i>

117
00:10:05,668 --> 00:10:06,501
Show them in.

118
00:10:13,501 --> 00:10:17,209
Hello, Henri. François.
After you.

119
00:10:23,709 --> 00:10:25,918
What was the idea last night?

120
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:28,876
- Coming to my house?
- You asked us.

121
00:10:29,043 --> 00:10:31,626
Your mistake!
It was for today!

122
00:10:31,793 --> 00:10:35,793
I couldn't have accepted!
Today, I have an engagement.

123
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:37,626
I don't get it …

124
00:10:37,793 --> 00:10:39,668
Are you free for lunch Saturday?

125
00:10:39,834 --> 00:10:42,043
Saturday? One moment …

126
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:45,334
It's OK with François.
One o'clock would be perfect.

127
00:10:45,501 --> 00:10:48,209
Saturday's fine.
I've nothing planned.

128
00:10:48,376 --> 00:10:50,334
We'll expect you, then.

129
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:55,126
Say …
There's a pretty girl over there.

130
00:10:58,876 --> 00:11:00,293
Well, well …

131
00:11:28,251 --> 00:11:29,626
What are you doing?

132
00:11:29,793 --> 00:11:31,001
Put that gun down!

133
00:11:31,168 --> 00:11:33,668
I know what I'm doing.

134
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:50,418
Who is she?

135
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:51,709
A girl from Miranda.

136
00:11:51,918 --> 00:11:53,251
From Miranda?

137
00:11:53,959 --> 00:11:57,376
Yes.
She belongs to a group of terrorists.

138
00:11:57,543 --> 00:11:59,126
They've been after me.

139
00:11:59,293 --> 00:12:02,084
- What for?
- What for?!

140
00:12:02,251 --> 00:12:04,626
To shut me up or to murder me.

141
00:12:04,793 --> 00:12:06,709
Who knows with terrorists?

142
00:12:06,918 --> 00:12:08,834
Did you notify the police?

143
00:12:09,001 --> 00:12:11,376
Right now, I'd rather not.

144
00:12:11,543 --> 00:12:13,376
No doubt you understand why.

145
00:12:13,543 --> 00:12:16,626
I had some trouble at the airport.

146
00:12:18,876 --> 00:12:21,876
They wanted to search
my diplomatic bag.

147
00:12:22,543 --> 00:12:24,418
I had to call the Minister.

148
00:12:24,584 --> 00:12:26,709
Search the …
That's unthinkable!

149
00:12:26,876 --> 00:12:28,376
Yes, well …

150
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:32,501
A month ago,
they arrested the Ambassador of …

151
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:36,543
An Ambassador
with 40 kilos of cocaine.

152
00:12:37,334 --> 00:12:38,918
An Ambassador?

153
00:12:39,084 --> 00:12:41,043
Which one?

154
00:12:41,209 --> 00:12:44,084
The matter was hushed up.

155
00:12:44,251 --> 00:12:46,209
There are 15 kilos.

156
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:52,168
The press didn't mention it.
It was the US Ambassador.

157
00:12:52,334 --> 00:12:54,293
The US Ambassador?

158
00:12:54,459 --> 00:12:57,501
It's the fourth Ambassador arrested.

159
00:12:57,668 --> 00:13:00,126
We'll have to find some other means.

160
00:13:00,293 --> 00:13:01,793
Want to test it?

161
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:03,376
The Harrison-Srauder?

162
00:13:03,543 --> 00:13:04,584
It's the best.

163
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:07,418
I have a sample. Come …

164
00:13:09,376 --> 00:13:10,834
Hold out your hand.

165
00:13:23,543 --> 00:13:25,209
It's pure.

166
00:13:25,376 --> 00:13:26,793
Excellent.

167
00:13:31,418 --> 00:13:33,584
I brought the first payment.

168
00:13:34,209 --> 00:13:35,418
You may check it.

169
00:13:36,126 --> 00:13:37,793
I trust you.

170
00:13:38,209 --> 00:13:41,584
The Marseilles gang suspects us.

171
00:13:41,751 --> 00:13:44,168
They'd like to know
who our supplier is.

172
00:13:44,334 --> 00:13:45,959
That's a nuisance.

173
00:13:46,126 --> 00:13:48,459
No use worrying now.

174
00:13:48,626 --> 00:13:52,001
Where do you intend
to invest that money?

175
00:13:52,168 --> 00:13:54,334
Not in Miranda.

176
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:56,209
Same place as you.

177
00:13:56,376 --> 00:13:59,043
What's the rate of the Deutschmark?

178
00:13:59,209 --> 00:14:01,209
3.17 to the dollar.

179
00:14:45,043 --> 00:14:47,584
- Should I wait here?
- Yes.

180
00:15:22,626 --> 00:15:24,584
Wait, wait.

181
00:15:34,626 --> 00:15:38,084
- Are your masters home?
- I'll tell them you're here.

182
00:15:46,334 --> 00:15:47,709
Smells good.

183
00:15:48,376 --> 00:15:50,584
I bet it's a vol-au-vent.

184
00:15:50,751 --> 00:15:53,168
You said
the demographic explosion …

185
00:15:53,334 --> 00:15:55,793
- What?
- That's it.

186
00:15:55,959 --> 00:15:57,543
I'll explain …

187
00:15:57,709 --> 00:16:01,459
- This is the earth.
- And here, the zodiac.

188
00:16:01,668 --> 00:16:02,751
Come here.

189
00:16:03,418 --> 00:16:04,876
Wait.

190
00:16:10,834 --> 00:16:14,126
- What is it?
- The guests are here, Sir.

191
00:16:16,168 --> 00:16:19,293
Tell them we'll be down.
Serve them drinks.

192
00:16:19,876 --> 00:16:22,626
They can wait 5 minutes.
Come on …

193
00:16:22,793 --> 00:16:24,334
Not here. We can't.

194
00:16:24,501 --> 00:16:25,626
But why?

195
00:16:25,793 --> 00:16:28,001
You scream too loud, you know it.

196
00:16:32,251 --> 00:16:34,126
What are we to do?

197
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:36,709
Put on your dress.

198
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:54,501
They'll be down shortly.
Help yourselves to drinks.

199
00:16:54,668 --> 00:16:55,959
Very well.

200
00:16:56,126 --> 00:16:58,959
- What may I offer you?
- Anything you like.

201
00:16:59,751 --> 00:17:02,209
- Same here.
- And you, Florence?

202
00:17:02,376 --> 00:17:04,043
I'd like …

203
00:17:05,084 --> 00:17:06,543
dry martini.

204
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:08,543
My sister had better not drink.

205
00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:12,418
When we brought her home
last night …

206
00:17:12,584 --> 00:17:13,918
She was dead-drunk.

207
00:17:14,084 --> 00:17:18,209
She threw up everywhere …
The lift, the taxi … It was ghastly.

208
00:17:18,376 --> 00:17:20,168
Her fingernails were filthy.

209
00:17:20,334 --> 00:17:24,334
It isn't true. They weren't filthy.
You're the one …

210
00:17:25,543 --> 00:17:28,376
Dry martinis for everybody?

211
00:17:32,043 --> 00:17:35,626
There is no better tranquilliser.

212
00:17:35,793 --> 00:17:37,751
I read it in a woman's paper.

213
00:17:37,918 --> 00:17:40,209
Let me do it. I'll mix it.

214
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:44,376
These glasses aren't right.
Fashion changed.

215
00:17:44,543 --> 00:17:48,751
For a dry martini,
the ideal is a cone-shaped glass.

216
00:17:48,918 --> 00:17:51,126
Here it is!

217
00:17:51,293 --> 00:17:53,334
That's about it.

218
00:17:54,459 --> 00:17:56,793
The main thing is the ice.

219
00:17:56,959 --> 00:18:01,126
It's got to be first-rate.
Very cold, very hard.

220
00:18:01,293 --> 00:18:04,751
15° or 16°C below.
Like this one.

221
00:18:40,876 --> 00:18:42,626
What are you doing?

222
00:18:55,876 --> 00:18:58,251
You pour the gin …

223
00:18:58,418 --> 00:19:02,168
You shake it to cool it,
and serve.

224
00:19:02,334 --> 00:19:05,334
Raphael knows that dry martini,
like champagne,

225
00:19:05,501 --> 00:19:07,293
should be sipped.

226
00:19:08,168 --> 00:19:09,584
Look …

227
00:19:09,751 --> 00:19:12,543
Let's do an experiment.
Get your chauffeur.

228
00:19:12,709 --> 00:19:13,834
My chauffeur?

229
00:19:14,001 --> 00:19:17,209
- What do you want with him?
- You'll see.

230
00:19:19,834 --> 00:19:23,543
Darling, like they did in New York
in the 30's,

231
00:19:24,168 --> 00:19:26,709
you can add
a few drops of Pernod.

232
00:19:27,626 --> 00:19:28,834
Maurice …

233
00:19:30,168 --> 00:19:33,584
- Can you come a minute?
- Right away, Your Excellency.

234
00:19:44,043 --> 00:19:45,334
This way.

235
00:19:50,709 --> 00:19:54,251
We'd like you to have
a drink with us.

236
00:19:54,418 --> 00:19:56,001
Thank you, Sir.

237
00:19:57,543 --> 00:20:01,418
- Cheers, ladies and gents.
- Cheers, Maurice.

238
00:20:07,751 --> 00:20:10,459
Very well, Maurice.
You may go. Thanks.

239
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,584
Good afternoon.

240
00:20:16,251 --> 00:20:17,959
See that?

241
00:20:18,126 --> 00:20:19,209
This is exactly

242
00:20:19,376 --> 00:20:21,626
what shouldn't be done
with a dry martini.

243
00:20:21,793 --> 00:20:24,418
Don't be nasty.
Maurice is a commoner.

244
00:20:24,584 --> 00:20:26,459
He's had no education.

245
00:20:26,626 --> 00:20:30,668
No system will ever enable the masses
to acquire refinement.

246
00:20:30,834 --> 00:20:34,918
And yet, you know me.
I'm no reactionary.

247
00:20:37,668 --> 00:20:40,001
But where are your masters?

248
00:20:40,168 --> 00:20:42,334
I don't know. They've gone.

249
00:20:42,501 --> 00:20:43,918
Gone? What do you mean?

250
00:20:44,084 --> 00:20:47,709
I saw them run out to the garden.

251
00:20:47,876 --> 00:20:49,209
How long ago?

252
00:20:49,376 --> 00:20:50,709
Four or five minutes.

253
00:20:50,876 --> 00:20:53,709
- Where were they off to?
- I don't know.

254
00:20:53,876 --> 00:20:55,001
Excuse me, Madam.

255
00:20:55,418 --> 00:20:57,251
What's the meaning of this?

256
00:20:57,418 --> 00:20:59,001
I don't know.

257
00:20:59,709 --> 00:21:03,626
Maybe we were denounced …
The police, a raid …

258
00:21:03,793 --> 00:21:04,959
Think so?

259
00:21:05,126 --> 00:21:08,043
Yes, otherwise,
why should they run away?

260
00:21:08,209 --> 00:21:11,543
- They could've warned us!
- What if they had no time?

261
00:21:12,543 --> 00:21:15,126
- Let's not stay here.
- You're right.

262
00:21:16,084 --> 00:21:18,126
Come on, hurry!

263
00:21:18,293 --> 00:21:19,626
Let's go!

264
00:21:19,793 --> 00:21:22,209
It's cosy, here.

265
00:21:28,168 --> 00:21:29,834
We must leave.

266
00:21:30,001 --> 00:21:31,168
Where can we go?

267
00:21:31,334 --> 00:21:33,626
Never mind, come on.

268
00:21:56,668 --> 00:21:57,751
On your way.

269
00:21:57,918 --> 00:21:59,126
Quick!

270
00:22:19,543 --> 00:22:20,584
Sir?

271
00:22:21,126 --> 00:22:22,418
Good day.

272
00:22:22,584 --> 00:22:26,168
I'm Msgr Dufour,
bishop of your diocese.

273
00:22:26,334 --> 00:22:28,876
Are Mr and Mrs Sénéchal home?

274
00:22:29,668 --> 00:22:31,751
No, my Lord, they're out.

275
00:22:32,418 --> 00:22:34,418
- Where are they?
- I don't know.

276
00:22:34,584 --> 00:22:37,876
They had guests for lunch
then they all left.

277
00:22:38,043 --> 00:22:41,501
- Will they be back?
- I suppose so, my Lord.

278
00:22:41,668 --> 00:22:43,126
May I wait for them?

279
00:22:43,293 --> 00:22:45,626
Certainly.

280
00:22:46,626 --> 00:22:50,543
I'd like to sit down a minute,
if you don't mind.

281
00:22:51,251 --> 00:22:54,793
- I'm a bit tired.
- Please do.

282
00:22:54,959 --> 00:22:57,126
- You walked?
- Yes.

283
00:22:57,293 --> 00:23:00,959
I had a car, but I sold it
for the benefit of the poor.

284
00:23:02,001 --> 00:23:04,084
- Do you want a drink?
- Thank you.

285
00:23:04,251 --> 00:23:05,209
I don't drink.

286
00:23:06,209 --> 00:23:08,959
Tell me, my dear,
what's your name, please?

287
00:23:09,126 --> 00:23:10,751
Ines.

288
00:23:10,918 --> 00:23:12,084
Tell me, dear Ines:

289
00:23:12,251 --> 00:23:15,834
is that the gardener's shed
I saw on the left?

290
00:23:16,959 --> 00:23:18,293
Yes, my Lord.

291
00:23:18,459 --> 00:23:20,876
But the gardener was fired last week.

292
00:23:21,043 --> 00:23:23,209
Yes, I know that.

293
00:23:23,376 --> 00:23:25,959
If you'll excuse me,
I have some work …

294
00:23:26,126 --> 00:23:27,793
Go ahead, please.

295
00:24:22,418 --> 00:24:24,834
What shall we tell them?

296
00:24:38,334 --> 00:24:40,293
- Ines?
- Madam?

297
00:24:45,793 --> 00:24:47,584
- Where are they?
- Who, Madam?

298
00:24:47,751 --> 00:24:49,126
The guests!

299
00:24:49,293 --> 00:24:51,584
- They've gone.
- Gone?!

300
00:24:51,751 --> 00:24:54,084
What does that mean?

301
00:24:54,251 --> 00:24:57,209
We were only gone for 20 minutes.

302
00:24:57,376 --> 00:24:59,584
They had all sorts of drinks.

303
00:24:59,751 --> 00:25:02,084
One doesn't leave like that!

304
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:03,626
You didn't stop them?

305
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:07,293
They looked scared
and left hurriedly.

306
00:25:07,459 --> 00:25:08,543
Scared of what?

307
00:25:18,668 --> 00:25:20,084
Hello.

308
00:25:20,251 --> 00:25:22,543
Mr and Mrs Sénéchal?

309
00:25:22,709 --> 00:25:25,834
I'm Bishop Dufour,
in charge of your diocese.

310
00:25:26,001 --> 00:25:27,668
I wish to talk to you.

311
00:25:29,043 --> 00:25:30,709
What's that?

312
00:25:30,876 --> 00:25:32,626
His Lordship came by a moment ago.

313
00:25:32,793 --> 00:25:36,251
- I asked him in and …
- Are you taking me for a fool?

314
00:25:36,418 --> 00:25:37,959
Come on, clear off!

315
00:25:38,126 --> 00:25:40,084
Go on, out!

316
00:25:41,959 --> 00:25:44,834
What got into you?
You let anybody in?

317
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:46,793
He said he was a bishop.

318
00:25:46,959 --> 00:25:48,501
And you believed him?

319
00:25:48,668 --> 00:25:51,084
When we're out,
beware of strangers.

320
00:25:51,251 --> 00:25:53,084
Is that clear?

321
00:25:53,251 --> 00:25:54,626
Very well, Madam.

322
00:25:59,084 --> 00:26:01,959
Come, let's tidy up a bit.

323
00:26:04,084 --> 00:26:06,376
They looked scared.
That puzzles me.

324
00:26:06,543 --> 00:26:08,418
Thévenot is always scared.

325
00:26:08,584 --> 00:26:11,168
I'll call the Embassy.
Perhaps they can explain …

326
00:26:11,334 --> 00:26:13,709
Wait a bit.
I'll bet they'll turn up.

327
00:26:13,876 --> 00:26:17,418
You're right.
The day's ruined anyway.

328
00:26:23,959 --> 00:26:25,334
Here they are.

329
00:26:35,959 --> 00:26:37,459
Good afternoon.

330
00:26:38,751 --> 00:26:41,751
You see?
Do you believe me, now?

331
00:26:42,459 --> 00:26:44,418
I don't get it.

332
00:26:44,626 --> 00:26:46,793
We are embarrassed.

333
00:26:46,959 --> 00:26:48,084
- Never mind.
- Will you forgive us?

334
00:26:48,251 --> 00:26:50,376
I gladly forgive you.

335
00:26:50,543 --> 00:26:53,084
- Take a seat.
- Thank you.

336
00:26:53,251 --> 00:26:54,126
Excuse me.

337
00:26:54,293 --> 00:26:56,418
Haven't we met before?

338
00:26:56,584 --> 00:26:58,293
It's quite possible.

339
00:27:02,876 --> 00:27:04,959
To what do we owe
the honour of your visit?

340
00:27:05,126 --> 00:27:08,418
It's very simple:
I'd like to be your gardener.

341
00:27:08,584 --> 00:27:09,668
I beg your pardon?

342
00:27:09,834 --> 00:27:11,001
Your gardener.

343
00:27:11,668 --> 00:27:13,043
To tend your garden,

344
00:27:13,209 --> 00:27:16,376
the vegetables,
the flowers, the lawn.

345
00:27:16,543 --> 00:27:18,418
You need a gardener, don't you?

346
00:27:18,584 --> 00:27:22,501
- Yes, indeed.
- Well, I'm applying for the job.

347
00:27:22,668 --> 00:27:25,834
- But really, my Lord …
- Don't be surprised,

348
00:27:26,001 --> 00:27:28,918
the Church has changed a lot.

349
00:27:29,084 --> 00:27:31,418
You've heard of the worker-priests?

350
00:27:31,584 --> 00:27:34,418
It goes for bishops as well.

351
00:27:36,209 --> 00:27:39,293
Are you skilled in gardening?

352
00:27:39,459 --> 00:27:41,168
I should say!

353
00:27:41,334 --> 00:27:44,876
As a child,
I lived in a large house …

354
00:27:45,043 --> 00:27:47,501
rather similar to this one.

355
00:27:47,668 --> 00:27:52,418
My parents - God rest their souls,
they both died a violent death -

356
00:27:52,584 --> 00:27:54,209
had a very good gardener.

357
00:27:54,376 --> 00:27:56,668
I learned everything from him.

358
00:27:56,834 --> 00:27:58,751
They died a violent death?

359
00:27:58,918 --> 00:28:01,334
Arsenic poisoning, both of them.

360
00:28:01,501 --> 00:28:03,251
Who did it?

361
00:28:03,418 --> 00:28:06,001
The culprit was never found.

362
00:28:06,168 --> 00:28:08,043
How much would you earn?

363
00:28:08,209 --> 00:28:10,543
Union rate, nothing more nor less.

364
00:28:11,168 --> 00:28:13,918
Our last gardener was non-union.

365
00:28:14,084 --> 00:28:15,334
Maybe.

366
00:28:15,501 --> 00:28:18,001
But I live by the rules.

367
00:28:18,168 --> 00:28:20,459
So, do you agree?

368
00:28:20,626 --> 00:28:22,334
Well …

369
00:28:24,251 --> 00:28:25,584
Alright.

370
00:28:25,751 --> 00:28:27,793
- When can you start?
- Right now.

371
00:28:27,959 --> 00:28:30,168
If you will show me your garden.

372
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:32,043
Let's go.

373
00:28:32,209 --> 00:28:33,584
Excuse me …

374
00:28:33,751 --> 00:28:36,751
a blade of grass in your hair.

375
00:28:36,918 --> 00:28:38,834
Oh, yes. It's nothing.

376
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:40,834
Let's go.

377
00:28:41,001 --> 00:28:42,751
See you later, Madam.

378
00:29:53,668 --> 00:29:55,293
What will it be, ladies?

379
00:29:55,459 --> 00:29:57,334
Three teas, please.

380
00:29:57,501 --> 00:29:59,293
- Milk or lemon?
- Lemon for me.

381
00:29:59,459 --> 00:30:01,084
Same for me.

382
00:30:01,251 --> 00:30:02,918
Milk, please.

383
00:30:03,084 --> 00:30:04,584
Very good.

384
00:30:10,001 --> 00:30:12,293
I can't stand the sight
of that musician.

385
00:30:12,459 --> 00:30:15,293
- Which one?
- The cellist.

386
00:30:18,126 --> 00:30:21,709
- Don't you like the cello?
- I hate it.

387
00:30:21,876 --> 00:30:24,043
Will you change places with me?

388
00:30:24,209 --> 00:30:25,709
Why not.

389
00:30:31,751 --> 00:30:35,751
The cello is an instrument
of which I'm very fond.

390
00:30:35,918 --> 00:30:36,959
The tone …

391
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:40,001
Most orchestras have dismissed them.

392
00:30:40,168 --> 00:30:41,084
Look at that …

393
00:30:49,001 --> 00:30:51,501
If only they were young …

394
00:30:55,293 --> 00:30:57,459
- Did you notice?
- What?

395
00:30:58,626 --> 00:31:01,209
The soldier sitting over there.

396
00:31:04,209 --> 00:31:05,293
He's a lieutenant.

397
00:31:05,459 --> 00:31:08,376
- You know him?
- No, why?

398
00:31:08,543 --> 00:31:11,334
He's been staring at us
since we came in.

399
00:31:11,501 --> 00:31:12,959
I don't know him.

400
00:31:13,126 --> 00:31:14,501
Neither do I.

401
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:20,293
He looks so sad.

402
00:31:22,584 --> 00:31:25,418
True.
But lieutenants often look that way.

403
00:31:25,584 --> 00:31:27,043
I've always wondered why.

404
00:31:27,209 --> 00:31:30,334
Terribly sorry, ladies.
We have no more tea.

405
00:31:30,501 --> 00:31:32,793
What? No more tea?
What do you mean?

406
00:31:32,959 --> 00:31:34,668
We had quite a crowd

407
00:31:34,834 --> 00:31:36,751
and we've just run out.

408
00:31:36,918 --> 00:31:39,459
- No tea at all?
- Not at all, Madam.

409
00:31:39,626 --> 00:31:41,251
Something else?

410
00:31:41,418 --> 00:31:43,126
I'll have coffee.

411
00:31:43,293 --> 00:31:45,501
- Me too.
- Me too, with cognac.

412
00:31:45,668 --> 00:31:47,834
We don't sell liquor.

413
00:31:48,001 --> 00:31:51,459
- Then bring us 3 coffees.
- Very well.

414
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:01,709
Excuse me.

415
00:32:01,876 --> 00:32:04,668
I'm Hubert de Rochecahin,
cavalry lieutenant.

416
00:32:04,834 --> 00:32:07,626
May I sit at this table?

417
00:32:07,793 --> 00:32:09,834
- But … certainly.
- Thank you.

418
00:32:11,459 --> 00:32:14,418
Madam, did you have
a happy childhood?

419
00:32:14,584 --> 00:32:16,876
Yes, very happy.

420
00:32:17,043 --> 00:32:20,543
- And you, Madam?
- Me too …

421
00:32:20,709 --> 00:32:23,584
- I have but happy memories.
- I haven't.

422
00:32:23,751 --> 00:32:27,209
I've several complexes.
The Euclid complex …

423
00:32:27,376 --> 00:32:29,459
My own childhood was tragic.

424
00:32:29,626 --> 00:32:31,501
Shall I tell you about it?

425
00:32:31,834 --> 00:32:32,668
Here? Now?

426
00:32:32,834 --> 00:32:35,584
It may be a bit long,
but it's interesting.

427
00:32:35,751 --> 00:32:37,876
Well, if you like …

428
00:32:38,043 --> 00:32:40,209
I remember, I was eleven …

429
00:32:40,376 --> 00:32:43,126
I was about to enter military school.

430
00:32:45,334 --> 00:32:48,209
Alright?
Not too tight under the arms?

431
00:32:48,376 --> 00:32:50,334
Button up your tunic.

432
00:32:51,334 --> 00:32:53,626
There you are, it's over.

433
00:32:55,084 --> 00:32:56,376
Very nice.

434
00:32:56,543 --> 00:32:58,668
Your father wants to see you.

435
00:32:59,459 --> 00:33:00,668
Come on.

436
00:33:05,376 --> 00:33:06,626
Your son, Sir.

437
00:33:06,793 --> 00:33:08,376
Please, leave us.

438
00:33:09,251 --> 00:33:10,709
Turn around.

439
00:33:13,793 --> 00:33:15,668
Take a few steps.

440
00:33:20,334 --> 00:33:21,376
Very well.

441
00:33:22,251 --> 00:33:23,876
Now, listen to me.

442
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:27,418
Your mother's dead.
I'm responsible for your education.

443
00:33:27,584 --> 00:33:31,126
At military school,
discipline is strict.

444
00:33:31,293 --> 00:33:34,084
But it's for your own good.

445
00:33:34,251 --> 00:33:37,418
I hope you'll do credit
to the name I gave you.

446
00:33:38,459 --> 00:33:40,501
That's all I have to say to you.

447
00:34:14,918 --> 00:34:15,876
Mother!

448
00:34:36,793 --> 00:34:38,876
<i>MOTHER, I …</i>

449
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:42,168
Hubert, my son …

450
00:34:42,334 --> 00:34:43,751
It's me.

451
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:45,918
Don't be afraid.

452
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,543
Come.

453
00:34:47,709 --> 00:34:49,793
Don't be afraid.

454
00:34:49,959 --> 00:34:51,709
Listen to me.

455
00:34:51,876 --> 00:34:53,334
Come closer.

456
00:34:54,543 --> 00:34:57,084
The man who lives here
and calls you his son

457
00:34:57,251 --> 00:34:58,834
is not your father.

458
00:34:59,001 --> 00:35:00,626
You understand?

459
00:35:01,709 --> 00:35:02,876
Look …

460
00:35:03,043 --> 00:35:04,793
This is your real father.

461
00:35:05,209 --> 00:35:06,043
The other one killed him

462
00:35:06,251 --> 00:35:09,418
in a duel, long ago.
We were very much in love.

463
00:35:13,043 --> 00:35:15,793
Now, listen to me.
Don't be afraid.

464
00:35:15,959 --> 00:35:17,334
Your so-called father

465
00:35:17,543 --> 00:35:20,834
wakes up every night
and drinks a glass of milk.

466
00:35:21,043 --> 00:35:24,751
In the bathroom cabinet,
you'll find a blue phial.

467
00:35:25,126 --> 00:35:27,918
Take this phial tonight,
when he's asleep …

468
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:29,918
and empty it into his glass.

469
00:35:30,084 --> 00:35:32,834
It's the last thing I ask of you.

470
00:35:33,001 --> 00:35:35,043
Adieu, my son.

471
00:37:04,168 --> 00:37:08,584
A few days later,
I was off to military school,

472
00:37:08,751 --> 00:37:11,418
where an exciting life
was in store for me.

473
00:37:15,334 --> 00:37:18,334
Sorry, ladies.
No more coffee.

474
00:37:18,501 --> 00:37:21,084
- What's this?
- And no more milk.

475
00:37:21,251 --> 00:37:23,668
- Are you kidding?
- Not at all.

476
00:37:23,834 --> 00:37:26,876
But we've been
extraordinarily busy today.

477
00:37:27,043 --> 00:37:29,168
There's no more coffee nor milk.

478
00:37:29,334 --> 00:37:31,418
What can we drink?

479
00:37:31,584 --> 00:37:34,209
- Do you have verbena?
- Sorry.

480
00:37:34,376 --> 00:37:36,626
No more herb teas.

481
00:37:37,293 --> 00:37:39,168
You have water?

482
00:37:39,668 --> 00:37:41,376
Of course!
That I can promise.

483
00:37:41,543 --> 00:37:43,918
So, bring some.

484
00:37:46,418 --> 00:37:48,168
It is hard to believe.

485
00:37:49,001 --> 00:37:50,959
Thank you for listening.

486
00:37:51,126 --> 00:37:53,168
With your permission, I'll leave.

487
00:37:53,334 --> 00:37:55,043
Suit yourself.

488
00:37:55,209 --> 00:37:56,543
And thank you.

489
00:37:57,126 --> 00:37:59,626
My God!
I just remembered!

490
00:38:01,709 --> 00:38:03,959
I have an appointment.
I must go.

491
00:38:04,126 --> 00:38:06,168
Excuse me.

492
00:38:06,334 --> 00:38:09,626
- We'll meet again.
- Sure. See you soon.

493
00:39:36,334 --> 00:39:38,876
Sorry I'm late, darling.

494
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:41,543
Not too much.

495
00:39:41,709 --> 00:39:44,751
- Champagne?
- With pleasure.

496
00:39:44,918 --> 00:39:46,001
No …

497
00:39:47,251 --> 00:39:48,501
Afterwards.

498
00:39:59,959 --> 00:40:01,043
No …

499
00:40:01,209 --> 00:40:04,876
- Take off your clothes.
- Switch off the light.

500
00:40:05,043 --> 00:40:08,209
- Why?
- It hasn't healed yet.

501
00:40:08,834 --> 00:40:10,293
What?

502
00:40:10,459 --> 00:40:11,876
Nothing on your hands.

503
00:40:12,043 --> 00:40:15,293
On my hands, no, but elsewhere …

504
00:40:15,459 --> 00:40:17,459
My God! If you saw it!

505
00:40:18,251 --> 00:40:19,918
In that case …

506
00:40:23,834 --> 00:40:26,959
This dress! What a nuisance!

507
00:40:34,751 --> 00:40:36,918
Turn off the light!

508
00:40:44,376 --> 00:40:47,293
- Did you hear that?
- Yes.

509
00:40:49,501 --> 00:40:51,168
Who can it be?

510
00:40:51,793 --> 00:40:53,168
Wait.

511
00:41:06,043 --> 00:41:07,251
Oh, it's you!

512
00:41:07,418 --> 00:41:08,543
Very good.

513
00:41:08,709 --> 00:41:10,959
Come. After you.

514
00:41:21,126 --> 00:41:22,584
What's up?

515
00:41:22,751 --> 00:41:25,376
I saw Sénéchal, this morning.

516
00:41:25,543 --> 00:41:27,626
He's sorry about
the missed luncheon.

517
00:41:27,793 --> 00:41:29,668
A misunderstanding, it seems.

518
00:41:29,834 --> 00:41:32,834
- He asked us to dinner tonight.
- Tonight?

519
00:41:33,001 --> 00:41:34,334
Who is it?

520
00:41:35,001 --> 00:41:36,543
Your husband.

521
00:41:37,126 --> 00:41:39,543
- My wife's in your room?
- Yes.

522
00:41:39,709 --> 00:41:42,251
She's been there five minutes.

523
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:45,584
That's odd.

524
00:41:47,876 --> 00:41:49,126
She didn't tell you?

525
00:41:49,334 --> 00:41:51,959
You're here? What a coincidence!

526
00:41:52,126 --> 00:41:55,501
I also came to invite Raphael.

527
00:41:56,376 --> 00:41:58,793
- Are you free tonight?
- Entirely free.

528
00:41:58,959 --> 00:42:01,751
- Shall we go together, as usual?
- Gladly.

529
00:42:01,918 --> 00:42:04,418
- A drop of champagne?
- No, I've got to leave.

530
00:42:04,584 --> 00:42:06,668
Coming home with me?

531
00:42:07,709 --> 00:42:08,876
No, wait …

532
00:42:09,043 --> 00:42:12,001
Let her stay just two minutes.

533
00:42:12,168 --> 00:42:15,501
- What for?
- I must show her the sursiks.

534
00:42:15,668 --> 00:42:17,709
- The what?
- The sursiks.

535
00:42:18,418 --> 00:42:19,668
Oh, yes …

536
00:42:19,834 --> 00:42:21,668
I'll wait in the car.

537
00:42:21,834 --> 00:42:23,584
I'll come right away.

538
00:42:29,084 --> 00:42:32,126
- What are sursiks?
- I don't know. It doesn't matter …

539
00:42:32,293 --> 00:42:33,251
Come!

540
00:42:33,418 --> 00:42:35,126
You're out of your mind!

541
00:42:35,293 --> 00:42:37,209
He might come up again!

542
00:42:37,376 --> 00:42:39,126
Just a minute …

543
00:42:39,293 --> 00:42:43,376
No.
Let go of me! Let me go!

544
00:42:50,793 --> 00:42:52,876
See you tonight, darling.

545
00:42:53,043 --> 00:42:54,084
Goodbye.

546
00:44:15,293 --> 00:44:16,584
Stand still.

547
00:44:16,751 --> 00:44:18,334
Hands up.

548
00:44:23,043 --> 00:44:24,251
Any weapons?

549
00:44:28,501 --> 00:44:33,043
You're better suited for love
than for war games.

550
00:44:33,709 --> 00:44:35,251
Come on, girl.

551
00:44:37,043 --> 00:44:38,459
Come on!

552
00:44:46,834 --> 00:44:48,751
You think I'm a bastard.

553
00:44:48,918 --> 00:44:51,418
I'd even be a socialist …

554
00:44:51,584 --> 00:44:53,126
if socialists believed in God.

555
00:44:54,001 --> 00:44:55,709
How old are you?

556
00:45:03,168 --> 00:45:06,126
You and your friends
don't stand a chance.

557
00:45:06,293 --> 00:45:08,084
Violence leads nowhere.

558
00:45:08,251 --> 00:45:10,209
I keep saying so.

559
00:45:10,668 --> 00:45:12,751
You're a good little housewife.

560
00:45:12,918 --> 00:45:14,918
You've bread, lettuce …

561
00:45:15,418 --> 00:45:17,334
The key to your dreams …

562
00:45:22,626 --> 00:45:23,834
<i>Caramba!</i>

563
00:45:26,126 --> 00:45:29,251
Forewarned is forearmed.
Don't you agree?

564
00:45:30,876 --> 00:45:32,668
Champagne?

565
00:45:36,168 --> 00:45:37,959
Do you have any brothers?

566
00:45:47,126 --> 00:45:50,001
In our heart of hearts,
we think alike.

567
00:45:50,459 --> 00:45:52,876
The bomb and pollution,
for instance.

568
00:45:53,043 --> 00:45:55,459
You're against them.
Well, so am I.

569
00:45:55,626 --> 00:45:58,251
You're in favour of free love?
So am I.

570
00:45:59,084 --> 00:46:00,668
You have no right to touch me …

571
00:46:00,834 --> 00:46:02,001
Mao Tse Tung is right.

572
00:46:02,168 --> 00:46:05,376
Bastards like you must be eliminated.

573
00:46:05,543 --> 00:46:07,751
No, I don't agree.

574
00:46:07,918 --> 00:46:11,543
If Mao said that,
it means he doesn't understand Freud.

575
00:46:11,709 --> 00:46:14,376
In fact, if you think about it,

576
00:46:14,543 --> 00:46:17,334
the only solution
to starvation and poverty

577
00:46:17,501 --> 00:46:20,001
is in the hands of the Army.

578
00:46:20,168 --> 00:46:21,918
You'll realize it in Miranda,

579
00:46:22,293 --> 00:46:24,834
when you have to open
your pretty thighs

580
00:46:25,001 --> 00:46:27,334
to an infantry battalion.

581
00:46:27,501 --> 00:46:29,209
You disagree?

582
00:46:32,501 --> 00:46:34,251
And now?

583
00:46:34,418 --> 00:46:36,751
Surely, your gun must be loaded.

584
00:46:36,918 --> 00:46:39,126
Since you came to kill me,

585
00:46:39,834 --> 00:46:42,126
I could easily get rid of you.

586
00:46:42,293 --> 00:46:44,126
Self-defence.

587
00:46:44,293 --> 00:46:47,543
But I'll show you I can be generous.

588
00:46:47,709 --> 00:46:51,084
The door is open. Get out.

589
00:46:51,584 --> 00:46:52,626
Go!

590
00:46:52,793 --> 00:46:55,876
I've a dinner party tonight.
I must get ready.

591
00:46:56,043 --> 00:46:57,709
Go.

592
00:48:09,793 --> 00:48:11,959
You don't know what W.I.M. means?

593
00:48:12,126 --> 00:48:13,668
To me, initials, you know …

594
00:48:13,834 --> 00:48:16,584
Women's International Movement.

595
00:48:16,751 --> 00:48:19,584
You know the rallying sign
of the W.I.M.?

596
00:48:19,751 --> 00:48:21,251
It's this.

597
00:48:22,043 --> 00:48:24,084
An idiotic sign like all the others.

598
00:48:24,251 --> 00:48:27,793
Fascists, communists, victory …

599
00:48:27,959 --> 00:48:31,668
and Christ is our Lord.
- And <i>Morituri te salutant.</i>

600
00:48:31,834 --> 00:48:34,293
Raphael, can you come a minute?

601
00:48:37,668 --> 00:48:40,168
May I introduce Don Raphael Acosta,

602
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:42,334
Ambassador of Miranda.

603
00:48:42,501 --> 00:48:44,709
Bishop Dufour.

604
00:48:44,876 --> 00:48:46,459
- Your Lordship.
- Your Excellency.

605
00:48:46,626 --> 00:48:48,584
We'll start dinner soon.

606
00:48:48,751 --> 00:48:51,251
In the meantime,
will you have a drink?

607
00:48:51,418 --> 00:48:53,793
I don't normally,
but I'll have a spot of whisky,

608
00:48:53,959 --> 00:48:56,001
with soda.

609
00:48:56,209 --> 00:48:58,626
- Raphael?
- Nothing, thank you.

610
00:48:58,793 --> 00:49:00,959
I'm delighted to meet you.

611
00:49:01,126 --> 00:49:04,834
You know we have
an important mission in Bogotá.

612
00:49:05,001 --> 00:49:06,709
Bogotá is in Colombia.

613
00:49:06,876 --> 00:49:09,709
That's right, it's in Colombia.

614
00:49:09,876 --> 00:49:12,584
I got mixed up.
I don't know Miranda

615
00:49:12,751 --> 00:49:15,251
but I hear
it's a magnificent country.

616
00:49:15,418 --> 00:49:18,084
The Andes cordillera, the pampas …

617
00:49:18,251 --> 00:49:21,334
The pampas are in Argentina.

618
00:49:21,501 --> 00:49:24,459
You're right.
The pampas … of course.

619
00:49:24,626 --> 00:49:25,751
I should know.

620
00:49:25,918 --> 00:49:29,126
Recently, I saw a book
on Latin America.

621
00:49:29,293 --> 00:49:32,376
There were photos
of your ancient pyramids.

622
00:49:32,543 --> 00:49:34,793
- Our pyramids?
- Yes.

623
00:49:35,251 --> 00:49:37,251
We have no pyramids in Miranda.

624
00:49:37,418 --> 00:49:39,709
Mexico and Guatemala have pyramids.

625
00:49:39,876 --> 00:49:41,876
- We don't.
- You're sure?

626
00:49:42,043 --> 00:49:44,626
Absolutely sure.

627
00:49:45,084 --> 00:49:46,584
Dinner is served.

628
00:49:49,584 --> 00:49:51,209
Please …

629
00:49:51,376 --> 00:49:53,709
We can go in to dinner now.

630
00:50:23,418 --> 00:50:24,501
My Lord, please …

631
00:50:24,668 --> 00:50:26,918
After you, Madam.

632
00:50:27,084 --> 00:50:28,709
Then, Raphael, you start first.

633
00:50:28,876 --> 00:50:30,501
If you insist.

634
00:50:39,209 --> 00:50:41,043
Who can it be at this time?

635
00:50:41,209 --> 00:50:43,876
Rosalie, answer the door.

636
00:50:59,251 --> 00:51:01,376
Ladies and Gentlemen, good evening.

637
00:51:01,543 --> 00:51:03,209
We apologize.

638
00:51:04,834 --> 00:51:06,751
I was expecting you tomorrow.

639
00:51:07,793 --> 00:51:09,793
Manoeuvres start one day earlier.

640
00:51:09,959 --> 00:51:12,626
But Colonel,
you arrive unexpectedly …

641
00:51:12,793 --> 00:51:15,793
I'm really sorry.
It isn't my fault, believe me.

642
00:51:15,959 --> 00:51:18,251
Tonight we happen to have guests.

643
00:51:18,418 --> 00:51:20,584
- Have you eaten?
- No.

644
00:51:20,751 --> 00:51:23,876
Give me five minutes.
I'll see what I can do.

645
00:51:24,043 --> 00:51:26,293
In the meantime, have a drink,

646
00:51:26,459 --> 00:51:28,418
and get acquainted with our friends.

647
00:51:28,584 --> 00:51:30,584
With pleasure.

648
00:51:31,459 --> 00:51:34,126
My Lord, could you give us a hand?
We need chairs.

649
00:51:34,293 --> 00:51:36,376
At your service.

650
00:51:42,918 --> 00:51:45,293
What's in the fridge?

651
00:51:46,293 --> 00:51:48,209
A pâté, some ham …

652
00:51:52,584 --> 00:51:55,209
Whisky? Dry martini? Vodka?

653
00:51:55,376 --> 00:51:57,501
Anything you like.

654
00:51:57,668 --> 00:51:59,709
A martini?

655
00:52:00,376 --> 00:52:03,209
I'm really sorry.
Mr Sénéchal had agreed

656
00:52:03,626 --> 00:52:05,626
to let us stay during manoeuvres.

657
00:52:05,793 --> 00:52:08,834
I never thought he'd have guests.

658
00:52:09,001 --> 00:52:11,126
- Mexican?
- Congo.

659
00:52:11,293 --> 00:52:13,418
- Very good.
- Infantry?

660
00:52:13,584 --> 00:52:16,334
- No, cavalry.
- I'm sorry.

661
00:52:16,876 --> 00:52:18,584
What are you smoking, Colonel?

662
00:52:18,751 --> 00:52:21,584
- Marijuana. You want some?
- No, thank you.

663
00:52:21,751 --> 00:52:23,459
- Excellency?
- Certainly not.

664
00:52:23,626 --> 00:52:25,209
I'd love some.

665
00:52:40,126 --> 00:52:42,168
- Not those chairs!
- Oh.

666
00:52:42,918 --> 00:52:45,043
I'll get some others.

667
00:52:47,126 --> 00:52:48,459
My Lord …

668
00:52:49,418 --> 00:52:51,168
It's alright …

669
00:52:54,626 --> 00:52:57,626
Unbelievable what they smoke
in the Army.

670
00:52:57,793 --> 00:53:02,293
My country's army
is remarkably strict.

671
00:53:02,459 --> 00:53:04,959
Marijuana is nothing.

672
00:53:05,126 --> 00:53:07,709
It's the first step.

673
00:53:07,876 --> 00:53:10,793
- I loathe drug addicts.
- So do I.

674
00:53:10,959 --> 00:53:14,626
Lately, 6000 US Marines
were discharged

675
00:53:14,793 --> 00:53:16,626
for being drug addicts.

676
00:53:16,793 --> 00:53:18,376
- My Lord …
- No, please …

677
00:53:18,543 --> 00:53:20,126
I insist.

678
00:53:20,293 --> 00:53:21,584
Very kind of you.

679
00:53:21,751 --> 00:53:24,584
Marijuana isn't a drug.

680
00:53:24,751 --> 00:53:27,084
Look at what goes on in Vietnam.

681
00:53:27,251 --> 00:53:30,043
From the General down to the private,
they all smoke.

682
00:53:30,459 --> 00:53:33,834
The result is, once a week,
they bomb their own troops.

683
00:53:34,084 --> 00:53:37,876
They must have their reasons.

684
00:53:38,043 --> 00:53:41,251
Remember, during World War 1,

685
00:53:41,418 --> 00:53:44,293
French troops had to drink
3 bottles of wine per day.

686
00:53:44,459 --> 00:53:47,209
- You're exaggerating.
- I'm not.

687
00:53:47,376 --> 00:53:50,876
And in spite of that,
there still were runaways.

688
00:53:51,043 --> 00:53:53,793
These were machine-gunned
by the gendarmes.

689
00:53:53,959 --> 00:53:55,834
There were hundreds of dead.

690
00:53:56,001 --> 00:53:57,251
Never heard of it.

691
00:53:57,418 --> 00:54:01,418
It's notorious. It's history.
They say it happened at Verdun.

692
00:54:01,584 --> 00:54:03,376
We can start dinner now.

693
00:54:03,584 --> 00:54:07,043
If we sit close,
we can all squeeze in.

694
00:54:07,209 --> 00:54:10,251
Helpings will be limited.

695
00:54:10,418 --> 00:54:13,418
But there are still some eggs,
ham and cheese.

696
00:54:13,584 --> 00:54:16,876
I'm sure everything will be alright.
I'm very sorry.

697
00:54:17,043 --> 00:54:20,084
Please, sit as best you can.

698
00:54:32,168 --> 00:54:34,709
- A little foie gras, Colonel?
- Gladly.

699
00:54:34,876 --> 00:54:37,001
- May I help you?
- Please do.

700
00:54:37,168 --> 00:54:38,543
Thanks.

701
00:54:38,709 --> 00:54:40,626
The manoeuvres go on for …?

702
00:54:40,793 --> 00:54:41,751
About a week.

703
00:54:45,043 --> 00:54:47,043
Message from the GHQ
for the Colonel.

704
00:54:56,334 --> 00:54:58,709
- Sir!
- What's that?

705
00:54:59,418 --> 00:55:02,126
Please excuse me.

706
00:55:04,626 --> 00:55:06,584
- Now what!
- What's the matter?

707
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:10,001
The Green Army's attacked
ahead of time. We must go.

708
00:55:10,168 --> 00:55:14,251
- But you didn't eat!
- Sorry, Madam, orders are orders.

709
00:55:14,418 --> 00:55:17,001
Ladies, Gentlemen.

710
00:55:17,168 --> 00:55:18,793
Gentlemen, we are off.

711
00:55:18,959 --> 00:55:20,543
- Sir!
- Yes.

712
00:55:22,834 --> 00:55:24,209
Ah, yes …

713
00:55:24,376 --> 00:55:28,126
The Sergeant has
a very nice dream to relate.

714
00:55:31,376 --> 00:55:32,626
We're listening.

715
00:55:35,751 --> 00:55:38,168
I had a dream, last week.

716
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:41,501
I was taking a stroll at dusk

717
00:55:41,668 --> 00:55:43,709
along a very busy street.

718
00:56:03,668 --> 00:56:05,209
You, around here?

719
00:56:06,168 --> 00:56:08,168
And you?

720
00:56:08,334 --> 00:56:10,001
I live here.

721
00:56:10,168 --> 00:56:11,543
Since when?

722
00:56:13,376 --> 00:56:15,626
Six years, I believe.

723
00:56:16,334 --> 00:56:19,293
- And you?
- I just arrived.

724
00:56:26,751 --> 00:56:29,626
What's the matter?
You're so pale!

725
00:56:29,793 --> 00:56:32,459
And you!
If you could see yourself!

726
00:56:32,626 --> 00:56:35,959
- You smell of earth.
- So do you.

727
00:56:36,126 --> 00:56:39,834
- Going to stay here long?
- Forever.

728
00:56:51,918 --> 00:56:54,043
Wait here a minute.

729
00:56:54,209 --> 00:56:55,793
I have to buy something.

730
00:56:55,959 --> 00:56:57,543
I'll wait.

731
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:03,751
Well, hello.

732
00:57:03,918 --> 00:57:05,001
Hello.

733
00:57:05,168 --> 00:57:07,959
Weren't you with Ramirez,
just now?

734
00:57:08,126 --> 00:57:09,126
Yes.

735
00:57:09,293 --> 00:57:12,084
It was him?
Are you sure?

736
00:57:12,251 --> 00:57:15,626
Ramirez has been dead
for more than six years.

737
00:57:16,251 --> 00:57:19,501
Yes, of course!
You're right.

738
00:57:19,668 --> 00:57:22,168
- How can that be?
- I don't know.

739
00:57:22,334 --> 00:57:23,709
I came across him.

740
00:57:23,876 --> 00:57:26,876
He told me he lives here.

741
00:57:27,668 --> 00:57:30,626
But now, I remember.
He died long ago.

742
00:57:30,793 --> 00:57:31,834
He went in there.

743
00:57:32,001 --> 00:57:34,418
I'll call him. Wait for me.

744
00:57:47,209 --> 00:57:50,043
- Is it you?
- Yes, it's me.

745
00:57:50,209 --> 00:57:51,376
You recognize me?

746
00:57:51,543 --> 00:57:53,584
How could I fail to?

747
00:57:53,751 --> 00:57:56,626
- You didn't forget me?
- Forget you?!

748
00:58:02,001 --> 00:58:04,418
Every time I tried to talk to you,

749
00:58:04,584 --> 00:58:08,376
you kept aloof.
You spurned me.

750
00:58:08,543 --> 00:58:11,209
- Remember?
- I remember.

751
00:58:11,959 --> 00:58:14,084
The last time,
you returned to the ground.

752
00:58:14,251 --> 00:58:17,709
Now, I meet you here
and you come to me.

753
00:58:17,876 --> 00:58:19,168
Why so late?

754
00:58:19,876 --> 00:58:22,876
I don't know.
I wanted to see you again.

755
00:58:23,043 --> 00:58:25,834
I looked for you in that crowd.

756
00:58:26,001 --> 00:58:28,293
Since I came here,
I've been looking for you.

757
00:58:29,001 --> 00:58:32,126
- We'll never part again.
- Never.

758
00:58:37,959 --> 00:58:41,459
Three minutes ago,
I bumped into an old friend.

759
00:58:41,626 --> 00:58:44,209
I'll bring him to meet you.

760
00:58:44,376 --> 00:58:46,293
I'll wait for you.

761
00:59:05,418 --> 00:59:06,959
Ramirez!

762
00:59:30,751 --> 00:59:32,709
Where are you, mother?

763
00:59:35,376 --> 00:59:37,793
I look for you among the shadows.

764
00:59:42,209 --> 00:59:43,626
Mother?

765
00:59:50,709 --> 00:59:53,334
I went, looking for my mother

766
00:59:54,001 --> 00:59:55,834
in the street full of shadows.

767
00:59:56,001 --> 00:59:58,418
But no one answered.

768
01:00:02,209 --> 01:00:04,959
Tell us about the train dream, too.

769
01:00:05,126 --> 01:00:06,001
Yes!

770
01:00:06,209 --> 01:00:09,418
No. The train we'll keep
for some other time.

771
01:00:09,584 --> 01:00:11,376
Let's go.

772
01:00:11,876 --> 01:00:13,376
My respects.

773
01:00:13,543 --> 01:00:15,293
Ladies, Gentlemen.

774
01:01:01,709 --> 01:01:04,001
When Lazarus rose from the dead,

775
01:01:04,168 --> 01:01:06,334
he had no memories.

776
01:01:15,334 --> 01:01:16,751
What's that?

777
01:01:16,918 --> 01:01:18,668
The manoeuvres are starting.

778
01:01:18,834 --> 01:01:21,209
I hope they'll spare the house.

779
01:01:25,334 --> 01:01:28,084
I'll prepare a hot drink.

780
01:01:35,751 --> 01:01:37,043
Good evening.

781
01:01:37,209 --> 01:01:38,793
It's me again.

782
01:01:40,918 --> 01:01:43,084
No, please, sit down.

783
01:01:43,251 --> 01:01:45,293
I hope the noise doesn't disturb you.

784
01:01:45,459 --> 01:01:47,168
No, it's quite normal.

785
01:01:47,334 --> 01:01:49,168
It's an artillery preparation.

786
01:01:49,334 --> 01:01:51,709
The cavalry will attack
in 20 minutes.

787
01:01:51,876 --> 01:01:53,334
I see.

788
01:01:53,501 --> 01:01:55,293
Mrs Sénéchal isn't here?

789
01:01:56,709 --> 01:01:58,626
So it was you, Colonel.

790
01:01:58,793 --> 01:02:01,459
- Have a cup of coffee.
- Thanks, I don't have time.

791
01:02:01,626 --> 01:02:04,334
I wanted to apologize again.

792
01:02:04,501 --> 01:02:08,168
I'd be delighted
if you, and of course your friends,

793
01:02:08,334 --> 01:02:11,501
agreed to come to my house
for dinner next Friday.

794
01:02:11,709 --> 01:02:13,751
The manoeuvres will be over.

795
01:02:13,918 --> 01:02:16,626
If my friends agree.

796
01:02:17,459 --> 01:02:18,376
Splendid!

797
01:02:18,543 --> 01:02:20,709
I hope his Lordship
will grace us with his presence.

798
01:02:20,876 --> 01:02:24,209
- I'll consider it an honour.
- Next Friday, then.

799
01:02:24,376 --> 01:02:27,293
My wife will be delighted
to meet you.

800
01:02:29,209 --> 01:02:30,043
We live

801
01:02:30,626 --> 01:02:32,751
at 17, rue du Parc.

802
01:03:18,084 --> 01:03:20,584
The masters won't be long.

803
01:03:33,126 --> 01:03:37,251
"Hat worn by Napoleon
the day of the battle of Wagram."

804
01:03:37,418 --> 01:03:39,043
I want to see that!

805
01:03:41,751 --> 01:03:43,626
Doesn't fit me. Too small.

806
01:03:43,793 --> 01:03:46,043
But I feel it's made for you.

807
01:03:46,209 --> 01:03:48,459
Henri! That's bad taste!

808
01:03:48,626 --> 01:03:50,709
What did I tell you?
It fits you to a T.

809
01:03:50,876 --> 01:03:53,126
What a child you are!

810
01:03:59,501 --> 01:04:02,084
- Would you like more?
- No, thank you.

811
01:04:02,251 --> 01:04:04,459
- Add some soda!
- No, thanks.

812
01:04:04,626 --> 01:04:07,043
Cheers!

813
01:04:10,543 --> 01:04:13,543
- Is it whisky?
- The bottle says so.

814
01:04:13,709 --> 01:04:16,709
- Tastes like quasi-cola.
- It is quasi-cola.

815
01:04:16,876 --> 01:04:20,959
If the meal is like the drink,
I'm not looking forward to it!

816
01:04:52,959 --> 01:04:54,543
Is this a joke?

817
01:05:21,626 --> 01:05:25,043
To prove your courage,
you invited to dinner

818
01:05:25,209 --> 01:05:26,626
the Commander's ghost.

819
01:05:27,334 --> 01:05:29,959
And to prove your courage …

820
01:05:30,126 --> 01:05:33,793
you invited to dinner …

821
01:05:46,376 --> 01:05:48,876
And to make us believe
that he had come …

822
01:05:49,584 --> 01:05:51,126
What am I doing here?

823
01:05:51,334 --> 01:05:53,876
You drugged us.

824
01:05:57,209 --> 01:05:59,334
I don't know the lines.

825
01:06:20,584 --> 01:06:22,418
What's eating you?

826
01:06:22,584 --> 01:06:23,959
Nothing.

827
01:06:24,126 --> 01:06:25,459
A preposterous dream.

828
01:06:26,209 --> 01:06:29,668
At the Colonel's,
we found ourselves on a stage.

829
01:06:29,834 --> 01:06:31,209
What?

830
01:06:36,793 --> 01:06:38,043
Hello?

831
01:06:38,834 --> 01:06:41,126
Good evening. What?

832
01:06:41,918 --> 01:06:44,126
What are you doing?

833
01:06:44,293 --> 01:06:46,168
We're at the Colonel's.

834
01:06:46,918 --> 01:06:49,084
We feared something had happened.

835
01:06:49,626 --> 01:06:52,376
I overslept.

836
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:54,293
We are leaving.

837
01:07:01,626 --> 01:07:03,459
How do I look, Raphael?

838
01:07:03,626 --> 01:07:07,001
Dreadful.
The hat's a bit effeminate.

839
01:07:07,168 --> 01:07:09,043
Excellency!

840
01:07:09,209 --> 01:07:10,751
You mean Napoleon was a …?

841
01:07:10,918 --> 01:07:15,168
I've already seen 3 hats Napoleon
wore at the battle of Wagram.

842
01:07:15,334 --> 01:07:16,834
I'm surprised.

843
01:07:17,001 --> 01:07:19,084
Another whisky?

844
01:07:19,251 --> 01:07:20,834
Excuse me.

845
01:07:24,126 --> 01:07:25,626
Some more port?

846
01:07:25,793 --> 01:07:28,543
I still have some.

847
01:07:36,876 --> 01:07:39,293
Glad to see you.
We were getting worried.

848
01:07:39,459 --> 01:07:41,876
I'm sorry.
It's all my fault.

849
01:07:42,043 --> 01:07:43,459
Good evening.

850
01:07:43,626 --> 01:07:45,834
Come and sit down.
Have a drink.

851
01:07:46,001 --> 01:07:47,876
I'll have a scotch.

852
01:07:48,043 --> 01:07:50,626
- And you?
- A drop of port.

853
01:07:56,543 --> 01:07:59,251
I hope you'll like it.
It's very old port.

854
01:07:59,418 --> 01:08:01,001
Please …

855
01:08:08,459 --> 01:08:11,209
Good evening.
Any news from Miranda?

856
01:08:11,376 --> 01:08:13,918
- What's the situation?
- Quite calm.

857
01:08:14,084 --> 01:08:15,126
And the guerrillas?

858
01:08:15,293 --> 01:08:18,751
There are a few left.
They're part of our folklore.

859
01:08:18,918 --> 01:08:21,293
You have problems
with the students.

860
01:08:21,459 --> 01:08:24,626
Students are young.
They must have some fun.

861
01:08:24,793 --> 01:08:30,001
How's your government treating them?

862
01:08:30,709 --> 01:08:35,209
We are not against the students.

863
01:08:35,376 --> 01:08:39,001
But what can you do when your room
is swarming with flies?

864
01:08:39,168 --> 01:08:41,834
You take a fly-swatter and bang!

865
01:08:42,001 --> 01:08:43,418
No more flies.

866
01:08:44,168 --> 01:08:45,751
One moment.

867
01:08:47,418 --> 01:08:49,959
I don't know your country
but I hear it's beautiful.

868
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:51,418
Indeed.

869
01:08:51,584 --> 01:08:54,126
Of course, you have no caviar
and no champagne.

870
01:08:54,293 --> 01:08:59,209
No, but we have things that are
just as good, if not better.

871
01:08:59,418 --> 01:09:01,126
Excuse me.

872
01:09:08,834 --> 01:09:14,209
Is it true that in certain areas in
Miranda there's still dire poverty?

873
01:09:14,376 --> 01:09:19,209
I can hardly believe that the gap
between rich and poor is widening.

874
01:09:19,376 --> 01:09:21,043
You've been misled.

875
01:09:21,209 --> 01:09:23,793
Our economy is expanding.

876
01:09:23,959 --> 01:09:26,209
There are figures to prove it.

877
01:09:26,376 --> 01:09:28,501
Excuse me.

878
01:09:33,584 --> 01:09:35,334
Excuse me, your Excellency …

879
01:09:35,501 --> 01:09:37,584
I heard you talk about your country.

880
01:09:37,751 --> 01:09:40,834
I'm interested
in administrative problems.

881
01:09:41,001 --> 01:09:42,918
What are you referring to?

882
01:09:43,793 --> 01:09:47,043
For instance, I'm told
it's common in your country

883
01:09:47,209 --> 01:09:49,584
to bribe a judge or a policeman.

884
01:09:50,876 --> 01:09:54,793
Maybe in the past, like everywhere.

885
01:09:54,959 --> 01:09:57,668
But today we are a true democracy.

886
01:09:57,834 --> 01:10:00,126
Corruption no longer exists.

887
01:10:00,293 --> 01:10:01,918
Excuse me.

888
01:10:08,084 --> 01:10:10,709
I don't think I belong here.

889
01:10:11,626 --> 01:10:14,293
- What's up?
- Nothing.

890
01:10:14,459 --> 01:10:16,168
I'll tell you.

891
01:10:16,334 --> 01:10:17,918
See you tomorrow.

892
01:10:28,251 --> 01:10:30,126
Your Excellency!

893
01:10:32,876 --> 01:10:35,834
- Leaving already?
- No, Madam. Why?

894
01:10:36,001 --> 01:10:39,126
My husband would like
to talk with you.

895
01:10:39,293 --> 01:10:41,751
I'd like to drink to your health.

896
01:10:41,918 --> 01:10:44,209
Gladly, Colonel.

897
01:10:47,793 --> 01:10:49,293
Here …

898
01:10:50,376 --> 01:10:52,959
- Your health.
- Cheers.

899
01:10:56,209 --> 01:10:59,626
Your country draws a lot of attention
these days,

900
01:10:59,793 --> 01:11:00,834
especially here.

901
01:11:01,001 --> 01:11:03,959
I read that Miranda holds
the world record

902
01:11:04,126 --> 01:11:07,251
for the number of homicides
per capita.

903
01:11:07,418 --> 01:11:09,959
You're mistaken, Colonel.

904
01:11:10,126 --> 01:11:13,459
Not at all. They say
people kill at the drop of a hat.

905
01:11:13,626 --> 01:11:15,584
There are at least
30 killed a day.

906
01:11:15,793 --> 01:11:17,501
No, Colonel.

907
01:11:17,668 --> 01:11:19,584
I think you're trying
to offend me.

908
01:11:19,751 --> 01:11:23,584
Me? Not at all.
I'm telling you what I know.

909
01:11:23,751 --> 01:11:27,668
I read it recently
in a very reliable report.

910
01:11:27,834 --> 01:11:30,293
I refuse to take your word for it.

911
01:11:30,459 --> 01:11:33,876
I know what I'm talking about.

912
01:11:34,043 --> 01:11:37,959
If I weren't your guest,
I'd demand satisfaction.

913
01:11:38,876 --> 01:11:42,293
I didn't know that chivalry
still existed

914
01:11:42,459 --> 01:11:45,251
in your semi-savage country.

915
01:11:46,043 --> 01:11:50,209
Sir, you just insulted
the Republic of Miranda.

916
01:11:50,376 --> 01:11:54,126
I don't give a damn
about the Republic of Miranda.

917
01:11:54,293 --> 01:11:59,293
And I shit on your entire army.

918
01:12:08,501 --> 01:12:10,709
What happened?
I didn't hear a thing.

919
01:12:10,876 --> 01:12:12,876
Calm down, Colonel.

920
01:12:13,043 --> 01:12:14,418
He's a charming man.

921
01:12:14,626 --> 01:12:17,376
The ambassador is a cad.
I treated him like one.

922
01:12:17,543 --> 01:12:20,376
- It's a misunderstanding.
- Be calm, Colonel.

923
01:12:20,543 --> 01:12:21,959
Tell us what happened.

924
01:12:22,876 --> 01:12:24,543
Nothing important.

925
01:12:24,709 --> 01:12:26,001
Excuse me.

926
01:12:32,918 --> 01:12:33,793
Colonel …

927
01:12:44,751 --> 01:12:46,334
What's the matter?

928
01:12:48,168 --> 01:12:51,293
I was dreaming that I …

929
01:12:52,043 --> 01:12:54,876
I dreamed that Sénéchal dreamed …

930
01:12:55,043 --> 01:12:57,334
that we were going to a theatre.

931
01:12:57,501 --> 01:13:00,959
Then, that we were invited
to the Colonel's,

932
01:13:01,584 --> 01:13:04,168
who quarrelled with Raphael.

933
01:13:05,043 --> 01:13:08,043
You're silly.
Go to sleep.

934
01:13:08,793 --> 01:13:10,709
Relax, go to sleep.

935
01:14:30,293 --> 01:14:32,543
- Good day, my Lord.
- Madam.

936
01:14:32,793 --> 01:14:36,043
The flowers are gorgeous.
The garden has never looked better.

937
01:14:36,209 --> 01:14:38,668
That's very kind of you.

938
01:14:38,834 --> 01:14:43,918
By the way, we're having
a few friends for lunch today.

939
01:14:44,251 --> 01:14:46,084
I hope you'll join us.

940
01:14:46,251 --> 01:14:50,043
- I'd love to, but I have work.
- I'd be delighted.

941
01:14:50,209 --> 01:14:53,084
Just close friends.

942
01:14:53,251 --> 01:14:55,168
Come whenever you can.

943
01:14:55,334 --> 01:15:00,168
I'll finish what I have to do,
and then I'll come.

944
01:15:00,334 --> 01:15:02,459
I suggest planting

945
01:15:02,626 --> 01:15:05,876
a border of hydrangeas
on each side of the door.

946
01:15:06,043 --> 01:15:08,501
Would you come and take a look?

947
01:15:12,793 --> 01:15:15,126
I plan laying out
two paths of hydrangeas

948
01:15:15,293 --> 01:15:19,001
from the door to the house.

949
01:15:20,376 --> 01:15:22,793
- Good day to you.
- What do you want?

950
01:15:22,959 --> 01:15:24,918
Where can I find a priest?

951
01:15:25,084 --> 01:15:27,959
You ought to go to the parish church.

952
01:15:28,126 --> 01:15:31,668
But Madam, I am a priest.

953
01:15:32,418 --> 01:15:33,584
What is it about?

954
01:15:33,751 --> 01:15:37,209
An old man who's dying
needs absolution.

955
01:15:37,376 --> 01:15:39,668
Wait for me.
I'll be back.

956
01:15:39,834 --> 01:15:41,959
Who is it?

957
01:15:42,126 --> 01:15:44,959
The man is very old and very poor.

958
01:15:45,126 --> 01:15:47,209
He lives in a farm nearby.

959
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:51,126
He used to be a gardener.
He is very ill.

960
01:15:51,293 --> 01:15:52,751
Then a doctor is what he needs.

961
01:15:52,918 --> 01:15:55,126
He says it's too late for a doctor.

962
01:15:55,293 --> 01:15:57,001
A priest is what he needs.

963
01:15:57,168 --> 01:15:59,209
Wait here.

964
01:16:35,959 --> 01:16:37,709
Father …

965
01:16:39,084 --> 01:16:41,126
I want to tell you something.

966
01:16:41,293 --> 01:16:43,126
Speak up.

967
01:16:43,293 --> 01:16:46,251
I don't like Jesus Christ at all.

968
01:16:47,126 --> 01:16:51,043
Ever since a little girl,
I've hated him.

969
01:16:51,209 --> 01:16:52,418
How come?

970
01:16:52,584 --> 01:16:56,543
Such a kind, gentle God?
How is it possible?

971
01:16:56,709 --> 01:16:58,834
You want to know why?

972
01:17:00,751 --> 01:17:03,959
I have to see this invalid.
We'll talk about it later.

973
01:17:04,126 --> 01:17:06,209
I have carrots to deliver.

974
01:17:06,376 --> 01:17:09,376
I'll tell you when I come back.

975
01:17:32,709 --> 01:17:36,043
You asked for a priest.
Here I am.

976
01:17:36,209 --> 01:17:38,751
I bring you the solace of religion.

977
01:17:38,918 --> 01:17:42,418
- Do you wish to confess?
- Yes, confess.

978
01:17:42,584 --> 01:17:44,459
I'm listening.

979
01:17:44,626 --> 01:17:46,376
Tell me your sins.

980
01:17:46,543 --> 01:17:48,001
Father …

981
01:17:48,168 --> 01:17:50,793
years ago,
I committed a crime.

982
01:17:50,959 --> 01:17:53,709
I killed a man and a woman.

983
01:17:54,459 --> 01:17:55,543
Who?

984
01:17:55,709 --> 01:17:57,001
My employers.

985
01:17:57,168 --> 01:17:58,793
I killed them both.

986
01:17:58,959 --> 01:18:01,709
They were so hard on me.

987
01:18:01,876 --> 01:18:05,834
Look there, the photo.
That's them.

988
01:18:06,251 --> 01:18:07,918
Him and her.

989
01:18:08,084 --> 01:18:12,668
The man behind them
with a rake is me.

990
01:18:13,626 --> 01:18:15,793
I was a gardener …

991
01:18:15,959 --> 01:18:18,043
Such a long time ago.

992
01:18:20,751 --> 01:18:22,876
And you know this little boy?

993
01:18:23,043 --> 01:18:25,668
That was their son.

994
01:18:25,876 --> 01:18:28,626
Yes … That was me.

995
01:18:29,584 --> 01:18:33,501
I remember this photo.
I saw it often.

996
01:18:33,668 --> 01:18:36,626
The couple you killed
was my father and mother.

997
01:18:38,126 --> 01:18:40,126
The culprit was never found.

998
01:18:43,459 --> 01:18:45,168
That was me.

999
01:18:45,751 --> 01:18:48,626
They treated me like an animal.

1000
01:18:48,793 --> 01:18:51,418
He was beastly.

1001
01:18:51,584 --> 01:18:53,543
And she … she …

1002
01:18:54,543 --> 01:18:56,293
Calm down.

1003
01:18:57,709 --> 01:19:00,834
You want absolution
before you appear before God?

1004
01:19:01,001 --> 01:19:03,084
Yes, for pity's sake.

1005
01:19:03,251 --> 01:19:04,626
God, in His kindness,

1006
01:19:04,793 --> 01:19:07,668
forgives the most hardened sinners.

1007
01:19:07,834 --> 01:19:12,001
What an example,
His bringing us together here.

1008
01:19:12,168 --> 01:19:13,418
Close your eyes.

1009
01:19:13,584 --> 01:19:15,543
Collect yourself …

1010
01:19:15,709 --> 01:19:17,459
and pray.

1011
01:19:18,001 --> 01:19:20,918
May Jesus Christ forgive you.

1012
01:19:21,543 --> 01:19:24,501
And I, on His authority,
forgive your sins.

1013
01:19:25,584 --> 01:19:29,751
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

1014
01:19:36,376 --> 01:19:38,501
Go in peace, now.

1015
01:20:32,293 --> 01:20:35,709
Do you want to drink,
or would you rather eat?

1016
01:20:35,876 --> 01:20:37,501
I'm starving.

1017
01:20:37,668 --> 01:20:39,668
Then let's eat.

1018
01:20:39,959 --> 01:20:42,626
We have omelette with truffles …

1019
01:20:42,793 --> 01:20:44,959
and a guinea-fowl with morels.

1020
01:20:45,584 --> 01:20:47,709
Ines, you may serve dinner.

1021
01:20:48,668 --> 01:20:52,084
The bishop should be here,
but he had to see a dying man.

1022
01:20:52,251 --> 01:20:53,876
Should we wait for him?

1023
01:20:54,084 --> 01:20:57,959
No.
He said to start without him.

1024
01:20:58,126 --> 01:21:00,293
Any plans for this summer?

1025
01:21:00,459 --> 01:21:03,668
- No.
- We haven't either, why?

1026
01:21:03,834 --> 01:21:06,251
What about coming to Miranda?

1027
01:21:06,418 --> 01:21:09,084
- Miranda?
- All of you, as my guests.

1028
01:21:09,251 --> 01:21:12,584
You'd have a chance
to discover my country.

1029
01:21:13,001 --> 01:21:15,709
Summer over there
must be terribly hot.

1030
01:21:16,251 --> 01:21:20,043
Miranda's in the southern hemisphere.
Summer here is winter there.

1031
01:21:20,209 --> 01:21:22,459
- Isn't that so?
- Naturally.

1032
01:21:22,626 --> 01:21:25,626
We French know nothing
about geography.

1033
01:21:25,793 --> 01:21:27,084
That's true.

1034
01:21:27,459 --> 01:21:31,168
Ines, answer the door.
It must be his Lordship.

1035
01:21:31,918 --> 01:21:35,751
Rumour has it that you're going
to be a Minister.

1036
01:21:35,959 --> 01:21:37,918
Police! Open the door!

1037
01:21:39,334 --> 01:21:41,584
In the name of the law!

1038
01:21:41,751 --> 01:21:43,834
Police!

1039
01:21:48,751 --> 01:21:50,626
Raphael Acosta?

1040
01:21:51,376 --> 01:21:53,043
Yes?

1041
01:21:53,209 --> 01:21:54,626
Inspector Delecluse.

1042
01:21:54,793 --> 01:21:57,793
You are Raphael Acosta,
Ambassador of Miranda?

1043
01:21:57,959 --> 01:21:58,793
That's me.

1044
01:21:58,959 --> 01:22:00,626
You're under arrest.

1045
01:22:00,793 --> 01:22:02,543
- What?
- Under arrest.

1046
01:22:02,709 --> 01:22:03,876
You can't.

1047
01:22:04,043 --> 01:22:06,876
I can. You're not in your Embassy.

1048
01:22:07,043 --> 01:22:08,418
Here's the warrant.

1049
01:22:08,584 --> 01:22:10,168
What about immunity?

1050
01:22:10,334 --> 01:22:14,043
I don't give a fig about it.
Take him away.

1051
01:22:14,209 --> 01:22:17,334
Inspector, there must be a mistake.

1052
01:22:17,501 --> 01:22:19,126
He can't have done …

1053
01:22:19,293 --> 01:22:21,584
- You are Henri Sénéchal?
- I am.

1054
01:22:21,751 --> 01:22:23,584
You're under arrest.

1055
01:22:23,751 --> 01:22:26,376
This is intolerable.
I want to call my lawyer.

1056
01:22:26,543 --> 01:22:29,501
Nothing doing.
Take him away.

1057
01:22:29,668 --> 01:22:32,709
Inspector Delecluse?

1058
01:22:32,876 --> 01:22:35,459
What a coincidence!
We're neighbours.

1059
01:22:35,626 --> 01:22:38,043
I know your charming little girl.

1060
01:22:38,209 --> 01:22:41,293
Are you François Thévenot?

1061
01:22:41,459 --> 01:22:44,043
- I am.
- You're under arrest.

1062
01:22:44,209 --> 01:22:45,334
What's the charge?

1063
01:22:45,501 --> 01:22:48,501
You'll know at the police station.
A nice catch!

1064
01:22:49,334 --> 01:22:51,918
You can't arrest people
just like that.

1065
01:22:52,084 --> 01:22:54,501
Take the women as well.
Quick!

1066
01:22:54,668 --> 01:22:55,501
Come on.

1067
01:22:55,668 --> 01:22:58,501
Don't touch me!

1068
01:23:00,001 --> 01:23:01,876
Let go of me!

1069
01:23:02,043 --> 01:23:03,376
You can't …

1070
01:23:03,543 --> 01:23:06,459
Leave me alone!
How dare you!

1071
01:23:06,626 --> 01:23:08,876
Take your hands off me!

1072
01:23:09,043 --> 01:23:13,459
Search the whole house,
the bedrooms, the cellar …

1073
01:23:34,793 --> 01:23:36,834
- What is it?
- Drug traffic.

1074
01:23:37,001 --> 01:23:38,793
Big shots, it seems.

1075
01:23:38,959 --> 01:23:40,834
Good evening.

1076
01:23:46,376 --> 01:23:48,126
What's the hurry?

1077
01:23:48,293 --> 01:23:50,876
- What day's today?
- June 14th.

1078
01:23:51,043 --> 01:23:52,626
I forgot.

1079
01:23:52,793 --> 01:23:55,168
- Obviously you're new here.
- Why?

1080
01:23:55,334 --> 01:23:58,418
June 14th is
the bloody sergeant's day.

1081
01:23:58,584 --> 01:24:00,918
Never heard of it?

1082
01:24:01,084 --> 01:24:02,126
Never.

1083
01:24:02,293 --> 01:24:04,834
Listen …
It happened at the time

1084
01:24:05,001 --> 01:24:09,043
the police were desperately trying
to win the love of the people.

1085
01:24:09,209 --> 01:24:12,043
- Remember?
- I remember very well.

1086
01:24:16,251 --> 01:24:18,543
Did you call the Home Secretary?

1087
01:24:18,709 --> 01:24:20,668
When can I get my lawyer?

1088
01:24:20,834 --> 01:24:23,459
- It's shameful!
- We're women.

1089
01:24:25,668 --> 01:24:27,709
- Are you staying?
- A bit longer.

1090
01:24:27,876 --> 01:24:31,709
- It's June 14th, don't forget.
- I won't forget.

1091
01:24:35,543 --> 01:24:38,084
As I was telling you …

1092
01:24:38,959 --> 01:24:42,668
at the time,
there was a sergeant so strict …

1093
01:24:42,834 --> 01:24:44,751
That's him, up there.

1094
01:24:44,918 --> 01:24:47,543
He was ruining our efforts
to be loved.

1095
01:24:48,084 --> 01:24:51,043
But even so, he was a decent sort.

1096
01:25:02,459 --> 01:25:03,876
Well?

1097
01:25:04,043 --> 01:25:05,834
Still silent?

1098
01:25:06,668 --> 01:25:08,376
Will you talk?

1099
01:25:14,084 --> 01:25:17,084
So, you won't talk?

1100
01:25:24,168 --> 01:25:27,543
Look …
I'll give you one last chance.

1101
01:25:27,709 --> 01:25:29,709
Will you talk or not?

1102
01:25:32,084 --> 01:25:33,626
Carry on.

1103
01:25:34,126 --> 01:25:36,209
- How's your wife?
- So-so.

1104
01:25:36,376 --> 01:25:37,751
Will it be a boy or a girl?

1105
01:25:37,918 --> 01:25:40,376
I hope it'll be a girl.
I already have two sons …

1106
01:25:40,543 --> 01:25:42,043
No! None of that!

1107
01:25:47,876 --> 01:25:50,459
You didn't plant
the plastic charge?

1108
01:25:50,626 --> 01:25:53,793
You're a nice boy.
Your views are sound.

1109
01:25:53,959 --> 01:25:56,459
But you know who did it.
So, talk.

1110
01:25:56,626 --> 01:25:59,334
And tomorrow,
you'll see your girlfriend.

1111
01:25:59,501 --> 01:26:01,626
I have no girlfriend.

1112
01:26:01,793 --> 01:26:04,001
You enjoy making an ass of me?

1113
01:26:04,168 --> 01:26:06,376
Too bad. You asked for it.

1114
01:26:06,543 --> 01:26:08,626
We'll have him play the piano.

1115
01:26:28,001 --> 01:26:29,501
No!

1116
01:26:29,668 --> 01:26:31,543
We won't kill you.

1117
01:26:45,126 --> 01:26:47,668
Now will you talk?

1118
01:26:47,834 --> 01:26:49,459
Nothing to say?

1119
01:26:59,501 --> 01:27:01,626
So one day, June 14th,

1120
01:27:01,793 --> 01:27:04,043
he was murdered
during a demonstration.

1121
01:27:04,209 --> 01:27:08,459
Ever since, on that date, every year,
he returns to redeem himself.

1122
01:27:08,626 --> 01:27:10,876
- Tonight?
- Definitely.

1123
01:27:11,043 --> 01:27:14,584
Stay if you like. I'm off.
I don't want to meet him.

1124
01:27:14,751 --> 01:27:16,918
I'm going too.
Wait for me.

1125
01:28:40,459 --> 01:28:41,834
No!

1126
01:28:42,543 --> 01:28:44,168
Stop!

1127
01:28:44,334 --> 01:28:46,418
Don't let them get away!

1128
01:28:46,584 --> 01:28:47,459
No.

1129
01:28:47,626 --> 01:28:51,168
What's going on, Sir?

1130
01:28:52,959 --> 01:28:54,334
Oh, it's you.

1131
01:28:54,501 --> 01:28:56,876
I was washing my hands.
I thought you called me.

1132
01:28:57,043 --> 01:29:01,626
Just imagine: I dreamt
that you had released the prisoners.

1133
01:29:01,793 --> 01:29:04,168
Me?

1134
01:29:04,626 --> 01:29:07,918
What a face you had!
Like a slaughtered ox!

1135
01:29:08,084 --> 01:29:12,001
Sometimes dreams are really …

1136
01:29:14,543 --> 01:29:16,043
Yes?

1137
01:29:17,168 --> 01:29:18,418
Hold on.

1138
01:29:18,584 --> 01:29:19,459
It's for you.

1139
01:29:19,626 --> 01:29:22,251
The Home Secretary to talk to you.

1140
01:29:27,168 --> 01:29:31,251
Yes, speaking.

1141
01:29:32,543 --> 01:29:33,918
Yes, I'll wait.

1142
01:29:39,001 --> 01:29:40,668
Inspector Delecluse?

1143
01:29:41,293 --> 01:29:42,668
Listen.

1144
01:29:42,834 --> 01:29:46,126
You arrested the Ambassador
of Miranda and his friends.

1145
01:29:46,293 --> 01:29:48,001
Release them immediately.

1146
01:29:48,876 --> 01:29:50,209
But, Minister,

1147
01:29:50,376 --> 01:29:52,543
it's already on record.
I can't …

1148
01:29:53,043 --> 01:29:55,584
Forget that. Do as I tell you.

1149
01:29:55,751 --> 01:29:56,959
Release them immediately.

1150
01:29:57,959 --> 01:30:00,751
May I know at least the reasons?

1151
01:30:03,418 --> 01:30:07,001
Our diplomatic relations …

1152
01:30:15,251 --> 01:30:16,584
I beg your pardon?

1153
01:30:17,168 --> 01:30:18,959
I didn't hear.

1154
01:30:19,584 --> 01:30:22,334
You didn't hear me?

1155
01:30:32,084 --> 01:30:33,668
Yes …

1156
01:30:34,251 --> 01:30:35,876
Very well.

1157
01:30:36,043 --> 01:30:38,126
I got it.

1158
01:30:41,668 --> 01:30:43,001
Sergeant!

1159
01:30:45,918 --> 01:30:47,709
Yes, Sir?

1160
01:30:49,084 --> 01:30:51,209
Release the prisoners.

1161
01:30:57,876 --> 01:31:00,001
Right away.

1162
01:31:22,209 --> 01:31:25,209
And … you spoke to the Minister?

1163
01:31:25,376 --> 01:31:26,709
Of course!

1164
01:31:26,876 --> 01:31:28,543
I called to thank him.

1165
01:31:28,709 --> 01:31:31,626
- I invited him to Miranda next year.
- And?

1166
01:31:31,793 --> 01:31:33,543
He'll do his best to come.

1167
01:31:33,709 --> 01:31:35,418
What time is it?

1168
01:31:35,584 --> 01:31:37,126
Quarter to nine.

1169
01:31:37,293 --> 01:31:40,959
I hope they won't be late.
My leg of lamb will be overdone.

1170
01:31:42,293 --> 01:31:44,751
Here they are.

1171
01:31:51,001 --> 01:31:53,668
Are we late?

1172
01:31:53,834 --> 01:31:57,459
- Not at all. How are you?
- Fine, thank you.

1173
01:32:00,001 --> 01:32:02,876
- What a lovely dress.
- Thank you.

1174
01:32:03,959 --> 01:32:05,668
Good evening.

1175
01:32:06,543 --> 01:32:09,001
- Good to see you, Raphael.
- Likewise.

1176
01:32:10,001 --> 01:32:12,001
What incredible traffic jams.

1177
01:32:12,168 --> 01:32:15,168
- It's Saturday.
- I should've set out earlier.

1178
01:32:15,334 --> 01:32:18,168
We ran across
150 or 200 cyclists, at least.

1179
01:32:18,584 --> 01:32:20,418
Let's skip cocktails.

1180
01:32:20,584 --> 01:32:24,209
We'll start with dinner
or my lamb will be overdone.

1181
01:32:24,418 --> 01:32:26,584
Good! I'm starving.

1182
01:32:26,751 --> 01:32:28,126
So am I.

1183
01:32:30,418 --> 01:32:33,751
I prepared a soup
with herbs from the garden.

1184
01:32:33,918 --> 01:32:35,168
A very good idea.

1185
01:32:35,334 --> 01:32:37,293
I cooked it myself.

1186
01:32:38,459 --> 01:32:40,126
Sit where you want.

1187
01:32:40,293 --> 01:32:42,001
François on my right,

1188
01:32:42,168 --> 01:32:44,209
Raphael, here.

1189
01:32:48,793 --> 01:32:51,543
I nearly didn't make soup.
Then I thought:

1190
01:32:51,709 --> 01:32:55,001
is a meal without soup
really a meal?

1191
01:33:08,668 --> 01:33:11,834
Well, Ines, how's your fiancé?

1192
01:33:12,001 --> 01:33:13,793
We broke off, Madam.

1193
01:33:13,959 --> 01:33:15,501
Why?

1194
01:33:15,668 --> 01:33:17,376
He left for the army
for 2 years.

1195
01:33:17,543 --> 01:33:20,376
- You could wait for him.
- He didn't want that.

1196
01:33:20,543 --> 01:33:22,376
He said I'm already too old.

1197
01:33:22,543 --> 01:33:25,168
- How old are you?
- 52, Madam.

1198
01:33:25,334 --> 01:33:26,876
Well, I understand.

1199
01:33:27,043 --> 01:33:30,501
She was my parents' servant
when I was a child.

1200
01:33:30,668 --> 01:33:33,334
I read that in Miranda,
they arrested a Nazi.

1201
01:33:33,501 --> 01:33:37,959
Von what's-his-name … A former
concentration camp commander.

1202
01:33:38,126 --> 01:33:40,918
It seems he was a real butcher.

1203
01:33:42,001 --> 01:33:45,959
Calling him a butcher
seems a bit extreme to me.

1204
01:33:46,126 --> 01:33:49,376
I met him once.

1205
01:33:49,543 --> 01:33:51,918
I tell you that
he's a perfect gentleman.

1206
01:33:52,084 --> 01:33:55,001
It's not incompatible.
One can be poor and a thief.

1207
01:33:55,168 --> 01:33:57,626
And rich and honest, darling.

1208
01:33:57,793 --> 01:34:01,418
What clothes did this
von what's-his-name wear?

1209
01:34:02,834 --> 01:34:04,168
Did he like animals?

1210
01:34:04,334 --> 01:34:07,209
He always went for a walk
with a big dog.

1211
01:34:07,376 --> 01:34:11,168
There are lots of Nazis in Miranda.
True?

1212
01:34:11,334 --> 01:34:14,001
- You like the soup?
- Delicious.

1213
01:34:14,168 --> 01:34:16,043
Add some salt, if you like.

1214
01:34:16,209 --> 01:34:18,626
I'm sure it's perfect, as usual.

1215
01:34:18,793 --> 01:34:20,293
I'll be right back.

1216
01:34:20,459 --> 01:34:22,543
Just going to check the lamb.

1217
01:34:29,626 --> 01:34:31,709
- What time is it?
- 9:10, Madam.

1218
01:34:31,876 --> 01:34:34,459
Take it out of the oven.
25 minutes per pound

1219
01:34:34,626 --> 01:34:36,626
is long enough.

1220
01:34:48,709 --> 01:34:50,126
Very good.

1221
01:35:06,668 --> 01:35:09,084
Many people don't know it,
but to carve lamb,

1222
01:35:09,251 --> 01:35:11,459
you have to stand up,
isn't that so?

1223
01:35:11,626 --> 01:35:13,834
It's more proper.
Bear that in mind.

1224
01:35:14,001 --> 01:35:15,584
Thanks for the lesson.

1225
01:35:15,751 --> 01:35:17,918
Tell me Raphael,
when were you born?

1226
01:35:18,084 --> 01:35:21,501
February 22, 1920.

1227
01:35:21,668 --> 01:35:23,251
Then you're a Pisces.

1228
01:35:23,418 --> 01:35:24,959
Sagittarius ascendant.

1229
01:35:25,126 --> 01:35:26,959
That's very interesting.

1230
01:35:27,126 --> 01:35:29,876
- Shall I serve you, Simone?
- Please do.

1231
01:35:31,084 --> 01:35:33,876
- Thank you.
- Hand me Raphael's plate.

1232
01:35:34,334 --> 01:35:36,584
Pisces - Sagittarius.

1233
01:35:37,293 --> 01:35:39,543
The coming together
of these two signs

1234
01:35:39,709 --> 01:35:43,584
enhances your personality.

1235
01:35:44,709 --> 01:35:47,418
By nature, you try to go
beyond your ego.

1236
01:35:48,001 --> 01:35:49,543
You think so?

1237
01:35:50,584 --> 01:35:52,459
François, some beans?

1238
01:35:52,626 --> 01:35:54,418
Especially in olive oil.
I love that!

1239
01:35:54,584 --> 01:35:57,168
- I put some in.
- Just for me.

1240
01:35:57,501 --> 01:35:59,834
- Raphael?
- With pleasure.

1241
01:36:00,001 --> 01:36:01,626
Excellent lamb.

1242
01:36:01,793 --> 01:36:03,126
- Not overdone?
- Perfect.

1243
01:36:03,834 --> 01:36:07,334
You like to participate in life.

1244
01:36:07,501 --> 01:36:09,626
You feel driven by great thoughts

1245
01:36:09,793 --> 01:36:11,584
and noble plans.

1246
01:36:12,793 --> 01:36:16,126
Your open mind has
a global view of the world.

1247
01:36:16,918 --> 01:36:18,751
Next time you dine with me.

1248
01:36:18,918 --> 01:36:20,751
You'll taste caviar with a spoon.

1249
01:36:20,918 --> 01:36:22,793
You like that.

1250
01:36:22,959 --> 01:36:26,293
Florence will mix her famous drink,
vodka and aquavit.

1251
01:36:26,459 --> 01:36:27,876
Yes!

1252
01:36:28,584 --> 01:36:33,543
Your sensitivity is in harmony
with your humanitarian conscience.

1253
01:36:33,709 --> 01:36:36,709
But if you reject approved ideas,

1254
01:36:36,876 --> 01:36:40,501
you must replace them
with your own morals.

1255
01:36:42,626 --> 01:36:45,876
I always followed
the dictates of my conscience.

1256
01:36:46,043 --> 01:36:47,459
More lamb, Raphael?

1257
01:36:47,626 --> 01:36:48,876
With pleasure.

1258
01:36:49,043 --> 01:36:51,584
- You like it medium?
- I don't care.

1259
01:36:51,751 --> 01:36:53,001
It's delicious.

1260
01:36:53,168 --> 01:36:54,584
Maybe I'm a bit perverse,

1261
01:36:54,751 --> 01:36:58,376
but I've a weakness
for American canned beans.

1262
01:37:11,293 --> 01:37:12,793
Everybody stand up!

1263
01:37:13,668 --> 01:37:15,918
Ladies too!

1264
01:37:17,126 --> 01:37:20,459
- What is this?
- Hands behind your head!

1265
01:37:20,626 --> 01:37:23,834
Move over there … quickly!

1266
01:37:27,584 --> 01:37:29,584
At least, let us explain.

1267
01:37:29,751 --> 01:37:30,959
You're misinformed.

1268
01:37:31,126 --> 01:37:32,376
Everybody to the rear!

1269
01:37:33,043 --> 01:37:34,626
To the rear!

1270
01:37:36,418 --> 01:37:37,918
And quickly!

1271
01:37:39,001 --> 01:37:41,251
When we've searched the house,

1272
01:37:41,418 --> 01:37:43,959
then we'll have time to talk.

1273
01:37:47,209 --> 01:37:49,376
What are you going to do?

1274
01:38:11,251 --> 01:38:12,168
Look!

1275
01:38:35,709 --> 01:38:37,876
Are you ill, Sir?

1276
01:38:38,793 --> 01:38:40,918
You shouted.

1277
01:38:41,084 --> 01:38:43,751
- Do you want anything?
- No.

1278
01:38:43,918 --> 01:38:45,001
Nothing.

1279
01:38:45,168 --> 01:38:47,584
Go to bed.
