00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:53,792
THE DIARY OF A CHAMBERMAID

2
00:02:34,846 --> 00:02:36,074
Hey, over here!

3
00:02:47,278 --> 00:02:48,142
You from "The Priory"?

4
00:02:50,477 --> 00:02:51,375
Is it far?

5
00:02:52,943 --> 00:02:55,273
You'll find out soon enough.
Get in.

6
00:03:18,139 --> 00:03:20,628
The countryside's always
a bit dreary.

7
00:03:27,837 --> 00:03:29,895
People probably don't have
much fun around here.

8
00:03:45,234 --> 00:03:46,825
Those your only shoes?

9
00:03:49,367 --> 00:03:51,959
What was that?
I didn't understand.

10
00:03:54,332 --> 00:03:55,424
Right, play the innocent.

11
00:04:27,727 --> 00:04:29,956
- What's your name?
- Joseph.

12
00:04:31,193 --> 00:04:32,160
That's all I needed.

13
00:05:20,851 --> 00:05:23,148
Ralph!
Come on, boy!

14
00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:36,882
- What are you doing around here?
- Nothing.

15
00:05:37,315 --> 00:05:38,373
Good hunting?

16
00:05:38,915 --> 00:05:41,848
I ran into her, so I bought
this off her.

17
00:05:42,082 --> 00:05:43,071
As usual.

18
00:05:44,248 --> 00:05:46,511
Did you make that?
It's very nice.

19
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:48,277
No, Mama did.

20
00:05:51,113 --> 00:05:52,512
You're filthy.

21
00:05:54,446 --> 00:05:55,435
Here, blow your nose.

22
00:05:59,712 --> 00:06:00,474
Harder!

23
00:06:01,645 --> 00:06:02,872
Now run along.

24
00:06:04,744 --> 00:06:08,040
You're not very clean either.
Why haven't you shaved?

25
00:06:09,843 --> 00:06:13,105
I was up at 4 a. m. and
I've already done 6 miles in the woods.

26
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:15,504
What did you kill today?

27
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:16,898
Nothing much.

28
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:19,001
No, I don't want to see!

29
00:06:19,975 --> 00:06:22,874
Aren't animals more beautiful alive
rather than dead?

30
00:06:23,441 --> 00:06:25,908
Hunting... is hunting.

31
00:06:31,874 --> 00:06:34,033
Careful how you handle this.
It's very fragile.

32
00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:36,667
Father is fond of it and it's costly.

33
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:38,128
Yes, Madame.

34
00:06:39,005 --> 00:06:41,097
- Do you break things?
- No, Madame.

35
00:06:41,672 --> 00:06:44,866
You all say that.
Unfortunately, the facts prove otherwise.

36
00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:48,362
Take off your shoes.
My father is very strict about that.

37
00:06:49,337 --> 00:06:51,133
This is a valuable Chinese rug.

38
00:06:52,736 --> 00:06:54,760
You'll track dirt in.

39
00:06:56,336 --> 00:06:58,859
Only Father keeps his shoes on.

40
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,102
But he's cleanliness itself.

41
00:07:01,769 --> 00:07:05,293
Be careful with this, too.
It costs a fortune.

42
00:07:05,868 --> 00:07:08,130
The mother of pearl and ivory
easily come unglued.

43
00:07:10,401 --> 00:07:13,196
- Do you keep clean?
- Yes, Madame.

44
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,765
I overlook a good deal
but I'm a stickler for cleanliness.

45
00:07:17,532 --> 00:07:18,760
Is your memory good?

46
00:07:20,632 --> 00:07:22,531
Don't touch these.
I clean them.

47
00:07:24,098 --> 00:07:26,826
You're clearly from Paris.
That dress won't do here.

48
00:07:28,231 --> 00:07:30,993
You'll be in my father's service.

49
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,490
True, I hired you but...

50
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:37,425
Well, you'll have to please Father.

51
00:07:39,329 --> 00:07:42,523
Father's a delightful person,
the kind you don't find anymore.

52
00:07:43,762 --> 00:07:46,751
He has his whims which are
understandable for his age.

53
00:07:47,261 --> 00:07:50,352
- Try to be very nice to him.
- I'll try, Madame.

54
00:07:51,294 --> 00:07:53,352
Now go change your dress.

55
00:08:04,758 --> 00:08:07,452
Most important, relax!
Fully relaxed!

56
00:08:08,457 --> 00:08:09,480
Hold your breath.

57
00:08:10,391 --> 00:08:11,380
Don't squeeze too hard.

58
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:12,913
Well, go on!

59
00:08:15,023 --> 00:08:19,183
- You never used a gun before?
- I don't think so.

60
00:08:20,322 --> 00:08:23,016
Nice! But I thought
you liked butterflies.

61
00:08:23,555 --> 00:08:26,147
I do!
I would rather have missed it.

62
00:08:26,721 --> 00:08:29,949
Now go clean up.
That beard is most unpleasant.

63
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:41,283
What pretty writing paper!

64
00:08:42,119 --> 00:08:43,517
Is that a crown?

65
00:08:43,818 --> 00:08:46,046
It's from the Duchess's.

66
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:50,576
"Celestine"...
She wrote your name on the picture!

67
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:54,647
Who's this on the horse?

68
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:58,106
William. He won the Grand Prix
at Longchamp 2 years ago.

69
00:08:58,483 --> 00:09:00,847
- Is he English?
- Hardly!

70
00:09:03,115 --> 00:09:05,412
You've known some fancy people!

71
00:09:06,081 --> 00:09:07,104
What's it like here?

72
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:11,012
Madame's father is very nice.
Very kind, very polite.

73
00:09:11,147 --> 00:09:12,307
- And her?
- Her?

74
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,244
A cow, that's obvious.

75
00:09:14,547 --> 00:09:16,571
She counts the sugar cubes,
locks everything up!

76
00:09:17,612 --> 00:09:19,511
All the same.
And Monsieur?

77
00:09:20,579 --> 00:09:21,546
Him?

78
00:09:24,811 --> 00:09:25,937
Thanks for the tip.

79
00:09:27,211 --> 00:09:28,768
It's obvious you're from Paris.

80
00:09:29,344 --> 00:09:31,640
Such pretty things in your suitcase!

81
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:54,804
Marianne!

82
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,436
Would you like something, Monsieur?

83
00:09:58,672 --> 00:10:00,366
Sure...
But who are you?

84
00:10:00,806 --> 00:10:02,705
The new chambermaid, Monsieur.

85
00:10:03,771 --> 00:10:06,966
Ah, yes...
Come in.

86
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:12,793
Good morning.

87
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:17,003
I'd like my...
my bathrobe.

88
00:10:17,636 --> 00:10:21,330
I left it on my... my bed.
My bathrobe...

89
00:10:23,235 --> 00:10:24,496
What's your name?

90
00:10:25,968 --> 00:10:27,229
Celestine, Monsieur.

91
00:10:29,468 --> 00:10:32,491
Pretty name.
Very pretty name.

92
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,524
Are you settled in all right?

93
00:10:34,933 --> 00:10:37,900
- I just arrived this morning, Monsieur.
- True, true.

94
00:10:42,398 --> 00:10:45,160
Excuse me, Monsieur, but where is
Monsieur's room?

95
00:10:45,864 --> 00:10:47,092
What for, Celestine?

96
00:10:47,465 --> 00:10:48,795
To get your bathrobe, Monsieur.

97
00:10:49,697 --> 00:10:53,130
At the end of the hall.

98
00:10:57,929 --> 00:10:59,123
Where are you going?

99
00:11:00,395 --> 00:11:02,521
Monsieur asked for his bathrobe.

100
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,852
But it's in the bathroom!

101
00:11:05,262 --> 00:11:07,785
Celestine, it was here,
I've got it!

102
00:11:10,994 --> 00:11:14,552
Be careful with this lamp, too.

103
00:11:15,493 --> 00:11:16,857
Be very careful.

104
00:11:17,793 --> 00:11:20,157
The globe has to be
ordered from England.

105
00:11:22,492 --> 00:11:23,549
That will be all.

106
00:11:38,956 --> 00:11:41,855
- I think it's coming out!
- It's in the corner!

107
00:11:48,288 --> 00:11:49,310
It's gone!

108
00:11:49,454 --> 00:11:50,819
Filthy thing!

109
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,546
You'll see plenty of them around.

110
00:11:58,219 --> 00:12:00,651
"Be careful with this lamp!
Be very careful!

111
00:12:01,186 --> 00:12:04,243
"The globe has to be
ordered from England. "

112
00:12:05,718 --> 00:12:07,981
She send her cracked chamber
pots to London too?

113
00:12:10,184 --> 00:12:12,208
I doubt I'll last 3 days in this dump.

114
00:12:12,984 --> 00:12:15,041
They all say that.
But you'll stay.

115
00:12:16,183 --> 00:12:19,343
Madame doesn't seem very keen
on you-know-what.

116
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:21,246
She have a lover?

117
00:12:21,382 --> 00:12:23,042
- No.
- Why not?

118
00:12:23,915 --> 00:12:25,575
- Apparently she can't.
- What?

119
00:12:26,248 --> 00:12:29,477
She's sick!
It hurts her!

120
00:12:30,114 --> 00:12:33,171
- So what? And Monsieur?
- He's a dead loss.

121
00:12:33,647 --> 00:12:35,636
All he does is hunt.

122
00:12:46,245 --> 00:12:47,734
You're sitting in Joseph's chair.

123
00:12:55,677 --> 00:12:57,234
Get this lamp out of my way.

124
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:05,765
Bravo, Madame will be pleased.

125
00:13:06,641 --> 00:13:08,574
- As if it was my fault!
- Or mine!

126
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:11,739
So I'll go to England
to buy a new globe.

127
00:13:14,107 --> 00:13:17,562
They beat up some wops and
kikes in Paris last night.

128
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,372
It's a good start!

129
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:23,268
Some folks here'll get theirs, too.
Not just wops and kikes!

130
00:13:23,605 --> 00:13:24,867
He never lets up!

131
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:26,963
What are wops n' kikes?

132
00:13:27,605 --> 00:13:29,696
Look at your mug in the mirror
and you'll see.

133
00:13:37,469 --> 00:13:39,629
- Who's it for?
- For you.

134
00:13:40,002 --> 00:13:41,593
Time for the old man's herb tea.

135
00:13:47,001 --> 00:13:48,433
Listen to this...

136
00:13:49,268 --> 00:13:53,428
"... But for the honor of our country,
an alternative Right does exist.

137
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:58,759
"Can it stand vertebrally and march
into combat united and determined?"

138
00:14:05,631 --> 00:14:06,723
Just a moment!

139
00:14:19,496 --> 00:14:20,690
Come in, come in.

140
00:14:24,995 --> 00:14:26,291
So you're Celestine?

141
00:14:27,994 --> 00:14:31,483
I really like the name.
Indeed, I do.

142
00:14:32,128 --> 00:14:33,219
Put that down there.

143
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,656
But it's a bit too long,
don't you think?

144
00:14:38,827 --> 00:14:42,157
Far too long.
If you don't mind, I'll call you Marie.

145
00:14:42,859 --> 00:14:45,553
Marie is pretty too and it's short.

146
00:14:45,925 --> 00:14:48,721
Besides, I've called all my
chambermaids Marie.

147
00:14:49,991 --> 00:14:51,184
It's a habit of mine.

148
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:54,086
And not one
I think I could break.

149
00:14:55,657 --> 00:14:57,715
- How many lumps, Monsieur?
- Two.

150
00:14:59,722 --> 00:15:02,121
So you won't mind
if I call you Marie?

151
00:15:03,089 --> 00:15:04,351
It's understood, then?

152
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:09,512
- Fine!
- I'll go now, if I may.

153
00:15:09,822 --> 00:15:13,277
Not yet, Marie.
Do you have a moment?

154
00:15:13,987 --> 00:15:15,385
I'm at Monsieur's service.

155
00:15:17,087 --> 00:15:19,679
Tell me now,
do you enjoy reading?

156
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:23,051
Yes, but I don't have
much time for it.

157
00:15:24,019 --> 00:15:25,349
But you know how to read?

158
00:15:27,019 --> 00:15:30,247
There are evenings when
I'm feeling weary

159
00:15:30,385 --> 00:15:32,045
and I enjoy being read to.

160
00:15:32,484 --> 00:15:35,315
It's so pleasant to listen to
a charming voice.

161
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,376
Why don't we have a little tryout?

162
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:40,539
Are you familiar with
Huysmans?

163
00:15:41,249 --> 00:15:43,408
A fine writer.
I really appreciate him.

164
00:15:44,183 --> 00:15:46,672
Sit down here a moment

165
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:50,006
and read me something at random.

166
00:15:51,681 --> 00:15:52,874
Sit down.

167
00:15:53,947 --> 00:15:55,244
Read, read.

168
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,306
"Since, in this day and age,

169
00:15:59,712 --> 00:16:01,941
"nothing genuine remains,

170
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:05,540
"as the wine we drink
and the freedom we proclaim

171
00:16:05,978 --> 00:16:07,911
"are adulterated and derisory,

172
00:16:08,511 --> 00:16:11,773
"and as it takes a good dose
of good will

173
00:16:12,211 --> 00:16:16,166
"to suppose that the ruling classes
are respectable

174
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:21,066
"and the lower classes worthy
of relief or commiseration... "

175
00:16:21,209 --> 00:16:25,267
Marie, look...
would you mind if I touched your calf?

176
00:16:27,275 --> 00:16:30,605
You've absolutely nothing
to fear from me.

177
00:16:31,341 --> 00:16:32,864
You don't mind?

178
00:16:35,074 --> 00:16:36,336
Keep reading...

179
00:16:36,773 --> 00:16:39,399
"The dreadful,
bleeding head glowers,

180
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,700
"scattering... clots...

181
00:16:43,339 --> 00:16:45,362
"of dark crimson

182
00:16:45,806 --> 00:16:48,034
"over the tips of its beard and hair.

183
00:16:48,505 --> 00:16:50,937
"Visible to Salome alone,

184
00:16:51,304 --> 00:16:54,032
"it neither embraces
in its sinister gaze... "

185
00:16:54,904 --> 00:16:57,336
Marie,
what size do you wear?

186
00:16:58,836 --> 00:17:01,496
- What?
- Your shoe size.

187
00:17:05,902 --> 00:17:06,766
5.

188
00:17:07,768 --> 00:17:08,962
Just a moment!

189
00:17:12,068 --> 00:17:13,898
Here they are...
"Rose des vents"!

190
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:16,600
Every evening
when you come to see me

191
00:17:17,167 --> 00:17:19,031
you'll put these boots on.

192
00:17:19,733 --> 00:17:22,199
They bring back memories,
you see?

193
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:24,293
No need to wear them
during the day,

194
00:17:24,433 --> 00:17:27,228
but in the evening,
I'd appreciate it.

195
00:17:27,932 --> 00:17:28,898
One moment!

196
00:17:32,564 --> 00:17:33,496
Come in.

197
00:17:35,797 --> 00:17:39,321
I asked you to be very careful
with this lamp!

198
00:17:40,129 --> 00:17:43,062
- But I can explain...
- No explanations!

199
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:44,521
What's the problem?

200
00:17:44,896 --> 00:17:46,192
She broke the lamp globe.

201
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:49,291
It's of no importance!
I never liked this lamp.

202
00:17:50,062 --> 00:17:51,961
Be more careful in the future.

203
00:17:57,027 --> 00:17:58,493
Always the same thing!

204
00:17:59,093 --> 00:18:02,651
Every time you make an effort...
What pettiness!

205
00:18:03,659 --> 00:18:06,716
My dear Marie, what can I say?
That's all for tonight.

206
00:18:06,858 --> 00:18:09,188
You may go.
Thank you.

207
00:18:22,222 --> 00:18:24,280
Pretty girl.
And good-natured.

208
00:18:25,189 --> 00:18:26,553
Fine, fine.

209
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:47,281
Do the bedrooms
but don't bother with my bathroom.

210
00:19:27,745 --> 00:19:29,405
Break out the glue!

211
00:19:49,008 --> 00:19:51,236
Did you throw those stones?

212
00:19:51,842 --> 00:19:53,138
So?
Don't like it?

213
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:54,765
What got into you?

214
00:19:56,707 --> 00:19:58,606
I feel sorry for you.
You're in for it.

215
00:20:00,173 --> 00:20:02,537
You work for a real scoundrel.

216
00:20:02,973 --> 00:20:03,871
In what way?

217
00:20:04,806 --> 00:20:06,601
So there you are at last!

218
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:11,335
You don't show yourself much.

219
00:20:11,838 --> 00:20:13,430
Sure, you're from Paris...

220
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:16,337
we aren't good enough for you.

221
00:20:16,637 --> 00:20:18,001
What an idea, Madame!

222
00:20:18,237 --> 00:20:21,897
Not Madame, Mam'zelle!
Mam'zelle Rose!

223
00:20:22,736 --> 00:20:26,327
She's more than just a servant.
She's a rarity among women!

224
00:20:26,702 --> 00:20:28,259
You mad at Mr. Rabour?

225
00:20:28,669 --> 00:20:30,533
Old man Rabour?
Not at all!

226
00:20:30,835 --> 00:20:32,802
I could care less
about that old cobbler!

227
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:36,197
It's his son-in-law, Monteil!

228
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,596
He's quite a number,
believe me!

229
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,731
He spreads nasty gossip about us.

230
00:20:42,066 --> 00:20:43,760
Like Rose eating at my table.

231
00:20:44,133 --> 00:20:45,565
What business is it of his?

232
00:20:46,299 --> 00:20:47,993
If she shares my bed,
it's my right!

233
00:20:48,965 --> 00:20:50,057
Of course!

234
00:20:51,099 --> 00:20:52,861
It's quite normal
for a single man!

235
00:20:53,198 --> 00:20:55,188
Monteil's a real scoundrel,
believe me!

236
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:59,254
He's funny. He's such a child.
So young for his age.

237
00:21:03,163 --> 00:21:04,424
You're nice-looking.

238
00:21:05,029 --> 00:21:07,928
Watch out.
There's already talk about you.

239
00:21:08,062 --> 00:21:08,994
About me?

240
00:21:10,795 --> 00:21:12,284
Don't do anything foolish.

241
00:21:12,694 --> 00:21:15,059
They say you and Monteil...
Be careful.

242
00:21:15,394 --> 00:21:18,656
If Madame doesn't fire 'em,
Monsieur knocks 'em up.

243
00:21:18,793 --> 00:21:19,589
No risk of that!

244
00:21:20,127 --> 00:21:23,991
Remember, with that fellow, bang!
The first time... a baby!

245
00:21:24,892 --> 00:21:26,756
A downright scoundrel!

246
00:21:44,789 --> 00:21:47,722
So, Celestine,
are you settled in now?

247
00:21:48,289 --> 00:21:49,381
I don't know yet.

248
00:21:50,055 --> 00:21:52,987
Is Monsieur settled in here?

249
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:56,083
Dammit, Celestine,
you must settle in!

250
00:21:57,154 --> 00:21:58,347
You must!

251
00:21:59,087 --> 00:22:01,610
I'll try.
With Monsieur's help.

252
00:22:04,786 --> 00:22:07,150
I bet you were up to mischief
in Paris.

253
00:22:07,719 --> 00:22:09,152
What must Monsieur
think of me!

254
00:22:09,552 --> 00:22:11,416
Why not?
A lovely girl like you!

255
00:22:13,051 --> 00:22:14,642
I'm all for having fun, dammit!

256
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:18,979
I'm all for love, Celestine!
For <i>l'amour fou!</i>

257
00:22:19,117 --> 00:22:20,879
I'll tell Madame.

258
00:22:21,817 --> 00:22:24,545
Madame!
To hell with Madame!

259
00:22:24,682 --> 00:22:27,206
I've had it with Madame!
Think I'll just sit back?

260
00:22:27,482 --> 00:22:30,244
Monsieur exaggerates.
Madame's always been kind.

261
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,004
Kind?

262
00:22:32,548 --> 00:22:35,606
Listen, Celestine,
she's ruined my life.

263
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,608
I'm no longer a man.
I'm a laughingstock.

264
00:22:38,747 --> 00:22:39,941
Care for a cookie?

265
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:47,337
I want so much
for you to be happy.

266
00:22:48,979 --> 00:22:52,503
You're not like my wife.
You're so sweet and good.

267
00:22:53,311 --> 00:22:56,039
- If you wanted to...
- What, Monsieur?

268
00:22:56,644 --> 00:22:58,235
You know what.

269
00:22:58,911 --> 00:23:00,502
Deceive Madame with Monsieur?

270
00:23:00,843 --> 00:23:04,139
It's all I think about!
Since you arrived, I haven't slept!

271
00:23:04,876 --> 00:23:08,706
I'm not a brute!
I promise I won't get you pregnant!

272
00:23:08,842 --> 00:23:10,570
Stop or I'll tell Madame everything!

273
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,630
Give me time to settle in.

274
00:24:10,766 --> 00:24:12,755
Kill it!
Don't let it suffer!

275
00:24:13,564 --> 00:24:15,929
They're better when they suffer.

276
00:24:17,264 --> 00:24:18,356
And I like it that way.

277
00:24:36,228 --> 00:24:37,888
The house needs tidying up.

278
00:24:40,527 --> 00:24:42,391
- Is Madame here?
- Next door.

279
00:24:43,393 --> 00:24:44,416
I'm coming, Joseph.

280
00:24:48,526 --> 00:24:50,890
It's fine-looking.

281
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:52,853
Yes, Madame,
more than 11 pounds.

282
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:54,725
Put it here.

283
00:24:56,091 --> 00:24:58,115
Do you want something?

284
00:24:59,657 --> 00:25:01,146
Is there something
you want to tell me?

285
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:03,454
Let's hear it.

286
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:05,613
It's the new chambermaid.

287
00:25:08,056 --> 00:25:08,920
What has she done?

288
00:25:09,355 --> 00:25:11,652
- She hasn't been here long but...
- But what?

289
00:25:11,988 --> 00:25:13,750
She's always
talking to the neighbors.

290
00:25:15,621 --> 00:25:17,781
Sunday she walked home
from mass with Rose.

291
00:25:18,254 --> 00:25:20,016
Once she even went
into their garden.

292
00:25:21,054 --> 00:25:22,782
Thank you, Joseph.
That will do.

293
00:25:37,951 --> 00:25:41,179
- Can I dunk my bread in the sauce?
- Sure!

294
00:26:05,413 --> 00:26:07,845
What are you doing here?
Know what time it is?

295
00:26:08,746 --> 00:26:10,145
You're not allowed in here.

296
00:26:10,612 --> 00:26:11,942
I told her to come in.

297
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,745
- Why?
- Because!

298
00:26:16,045 --> 00:26:18,739
- So how's your aunt?
- Not very good.

299
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:21,404
As usual.

300
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:28,367
Look me in the eye.
Straight in the eye.

301
00:26:28,876 --> 00:26:29,933
What d'you see?

302
00:26:31,409 --> 00:26:32,739
I see me.

303
00:26:33,875 --> 00:26:35,432
That shows I like you.

304
00:26:36,174 --> 00:26:37,607
That I've got you in mind.

305
00:26:55,171 --> 00:26:56,728
- No, thanks.
- Not hungry?

306
00:26:58,738 --> 00:26:59,864
She prefers truffles.

307
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:01,864
I've eaten truffles before.

308
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:03,636
No one here can say as much.

309
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:07,100
- Where's the butter?
- No butter.

310
00:27:07,902 --> 00:27:09,732
Ask next door for the key.

311
00:27:10,702 --> 00:27:11,634
Pass the bread.

312
00:27:19,268 --> 00:27:22,428
While you're up,
pass me one.

313
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,789
I don't wait on tattletales.

314
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,796
On what?

315
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,929
I'll see the neighbors when I like.

316
00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:32,788
So go tell them that next door.

317
00:27:33,266 --> 00:27:34,596
I hear the dogs!

318
00:27:35,398 --> 00:27:37,092
It must be the sexton.

319
00:27:39,131 --> 00:27:40,358
You're sleepy.

320
00:27:41,897 --> 00:27:43,193
Come here.

321
00:27:44,197 --> 00:27:46,130
Take this apple.

322
00:27:48,329 --> 00:27:49,125
Come in.

323
00:27:49,263 --> 00:27:50,355
'Evening, all!

324
00:27:50,496 --> 00:27:52,655
See that rain?
Not very warm either.

325
00:27:53,428 --> 00:27:54,258
Sit down.

326
00:27:57,694 --> 00:27:58,717
Shouldn't the child be home?

327
00:27:58,861 --> 00:27:59,793
She's all right here.

328
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:01,155
I'd like some cheese.

329
00:28:03,426 --> 00:28:05,416
- Nice and warm in here!
- Have a drink.

330
00:28:06,326 --> 00:28:08,986
I hear that in the Le Havre strike

331
00:28:09,126 --> 00:28:11,217
they wounded
20 blue-collar bastards.

332
00:28:11,592 --> 00:28:12,786
A shame they didn't all croak!

333
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,825
And in Romania they killed 12 Jews.

334
00:28:16,358 --> 00:28:18,450
That makes 12 less!
That's always something!

335
00:28:19,224 --> 00:28:21,157
- And Richard's article?
- Terrific!

336
00:28:22,024 --> 00:28:23,923
Cheers!

337
00:28:26,323 --> 00:28:28,289
Why always talk about
killing Jews?

338
00:28:28,756 --> 00:28:30,780
- Aren't you a patriot?
- Sure!

339
00:28:31,122 --> 00:28:32,054
So?

340
00:28:32,489 --> 00:28:34,250
If I was in Paris,
I'd kill one a day!

341
00:28:34,788 --> 00:28:38,584
The government ministers
and the judges have all sold out.

342
00:28:39,021 --> 00:28:40,681
That's why things are so rotten!

343
00:28:41,621 --> 00:28:43,678
Scratch a Bolshevik
and you'll find a Jew.

344
00:28:45,053 --> 00:28:47,178
They're attacking religion again.

345
00:28:47,419 --> 00:28:49,613
- Oh, priests...
- I know you hate 'em.

346
00:28:49,852 --> 00:28:52,876
But I'm for religion.
We need it.

347
00:28:53,151 --> 00:28:55,845
I told you, the clergy will help
get rid of the Jews.

348
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:02,539
For me again!

349
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:08,646
I'll put the kid to bed
in my room.

350
00:29:09,983 --> 00:29:11,415
I can take her home.

351
00:29:11,849 --> 00:29:13,815
She's staying here with me.

352
00:29:14,182 --> 00:29:16,546
- I won't eat her.
- My mind's made up.

353
00:29:19,281 --> 00:29:20,941
Let's get down to it.

354
00:29:21,747 --> 00:29:23,213
I don't want to turn in too late.

355
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,769
Get me some paper and ink.

356
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:42,002
Don't make any noise.

357
00:29:57,175 --> 00:29:58,164
Tell me, Celestine...

358
00:29:59,108 --> 00:30:02,040
Do maids in Paris
usually wear perfume?

359
00:30:02,674 --> 00:30:03,800
It depends.

360
00:30:04,141 --> 00:30:06,664
Some wear perfume,
some don't.

361
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:10,306
Well, here we feel perfume
is improper for ladies.

362
00:30:11,172 --> 00:30:13,968
- Especially maids, you understand?
- Very well, Madame.

363
00:30:15,638 --> 00:30:17,195
Take this away.
It stinks.

364
00:30:17,938 --> 00:30:19,461
Take the cups, as well.

365
00:30:30,803 --> 00:30:33,735
- Aren't you overdoing it, dear?
- Be quiet, you!

366
00:30:34,069 --> 00:30:36,661
- And don't hang around that girl!
- Me?

367
00:30:36,802 --> 00:30:39,996
The Jesureau girl last year
cost me 1500 francs!

368
00:30:41,167 --> 00:30:43,566
But, dear, a girl like Celestine
who comes from Paris...

369
00:30:44,967 --> 00:30:46,433
God knows the things she's done!

370
00:30:46,833 --> 00:30:49,459
The diseases she's picked up!
And you accuse me... ?

371
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:50,891
I know you.

372
00:30:53,532 --> 00:30:57,192
I'd hoped for a pleasant evening
with you after dinner,

373
00:30:57,332 --> 00:30:58,821
but you immediately
start shouting!

374
00:30:58,965 --> 00:31:00,931
I prefer going up to my room.

375
00:31:07,096 --> 00:31:08,188
Good night, Father.

376
00:31:11,829 --> 00:31:15,091
Look, dear,
if you're worried about Celestine...

377
00:31:15,229 --> 00:31:18,662
I'm not jealous,
but I don't want it costing me any money!

378
00:32:09,287 --> 00:32:10,276
There!

379
00:32:11,486 --> 00:32:12,851
"To French patriots!

380
00:32:13,653 --> 00:32:17,346
"France has been delivered to
foreigners and sold for Jewish gold!

381
00:32:17,952 --> 00:32:19,543
"The French army is scorned!

382
00:32:20,084 --> 00:32:22,074
"The Catholic Church persecuted!

383
00:32:23,118 --> 00:32:24,175
"Be prepared!

384
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:27,349
"The hour of the National
Revolution is at hand!

385
00:32:27,783 --> 00:32:31,147
"Enough lies and treason!
Enough scandals!"

386
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:33,178
Not "enough scandals. "

387
00:32:33,615 --> 00:32:35,241
"Enough filth"!
It has more clout.

388
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:39,574
Why are you staring at me?

389
00:32:40,148 --> 00:32:44,637
I prefer "Enough scandals!"

390
00:32:45,914 --> 00:32:47,108
Who asked you?

391
00:32:48,547 --> 00:32:51,513
"The hour of the
National Revolution is at hand!

392
00:32:51,979 --> 00:32:53,969
"Enough lies and treason!

393
00:32:54,445 --> 00:32:55,673
"Enough filth!"

394
00:33:14,276 --> 00:33:15,265
Come in, Marie.

395
00:33:52,936 --> 00:33:53,959
What's this?

396
00:33:56,135 --> 00:33:57,124
What are you doing?

397
00:33:58,002 --> 00:33:59,696
- I was just...
- What?

398
00:34:00,601 --> 00:34:01,727
My shoes!

399
00:34:02,468 --> 00:34:03,627
Shoes?

400
00:34:04,168 --> 00:34:05,327
Yes, Monsieur.

401
00:34:06,034 --> 00:34:08,727
Not tonight, Marie.
You may go now.

402
00:34:09,833 --> 00:34:13,027
Never mind.
You can pick it up tomorrow.

403
00:35:07,357 --> 00:35:08,585
So...

404
00:35:09,123 --> 00:35:10,953
- Coming to see me?
- Don't touch me.

405
00:35:11,556 --> 00:35:13,147
Sweet little Celestine!

406
00:35:13,723 --> 00:35:17,780
Settling in, are we?

407
00:35:18,022 --> 00:35:20,113
Let go!
Monsieur knows I'm a trollop.

408
00:35:20,355 --> 00:35:22,219
- What're you saying?
- A dirty girl!

409
00:35:22,721 --> 00:35:24,210
But, my little Celestine...

410
00:35:24,587 --> 00:35:26,679
- I'm diseased.
- What?

411
00:35:27,887 --> 00:35:29,013
I've got the pox.

412
00:35:30,053 --> 00:35:31,916
Goddamn!
Goddamn!

413
00:35:32,486 --> 00:35:34,180
Celestine, listen!

414
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:35,747
Nuts!

415
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,172
Hey, you!

416
00:35:55,816 --> 00:35:58,044
Don't mind me!
Cutting my branches off now?

417
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:00,338
They're growing into my garden.

418
00:36:01,148 --> 00:36:04,115
Don't like it?
I'm within my rights!

419
00:36:04,847 --> 00:36:06,905
I've just about had it with you!
Just look!

420
00:36:07,046 --> 00:36:11,138
You not only throw me your garbage,
you cut my trees now!

421
00:36:12,046 --> 00:36:14,807
- I'll take you to court!
- You name the day!

422
00:36:15,112 --> 00:36:17,305
I have witnesses this time!

423
00:36:18,712 --> 00:36:20,440
Let's see your witnesses!

424
00:36:21,245 --> 00:36:24,575
Joseph! He cut my branches.
You saw it, no?

425
00:36:24,978 --> 00:36:25,966
You agree?

426
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:28,944
Perfect!

427
00:36:29,376 --> 00:36:31,673
A servant!
Servants don't count.

428
00:36:32,076 --> 00:36:34,043
We'll see about that,
you scoundrel!

429
00:36:36,076 --> 00:36:37,235
Oh, no,
we won't!

430
00:36:37,775 --> 00:36:39,139
I'll drag you into court.

431
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:41,105
By force,
if need be.

432
00:36:41,341 --> 00:36:42,808
Anytime you want!

433
00:36:42,975 --> 00:36:45,736
We'll see your nerve,
you big coward!

434
00:37:00,438 --> 00:37:01,461
Dirty Jew!

435
00:38:17,992 --> 00:38:19,788
- Who is it?
- Me, Madame.

436
00:38:20,292 --> 00:38:21,350
What do you want?

437
00:38:21,691 --> 00:38:24,920
I can't do the bathroom now
because...

438
00:38:25,124 --> 00:38:27,784
It's done.
Don't come unless I call you.

439
00:38:37,589 --> 00:38:41,044
Marie...
Come in here a minute.

440
00:38:58,985 --> 00:39:00,077
Do you like them?

441
00:39:02,118 --> 00:39:03,914
Not very clean, are they?

442
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:06,248
Fine.

443
00:39:07,083 --> 00:39:09,448
Would you like to see others?

444
00:39:09,883 --> 00:39:12,247
Others?
I think these will do...

445
00:39:13,216 --> 00:39:14,615
But in patent leather.

446
00:39:16,615 --> 00:39:18,014
Fine patent leather!

447
00:39:21,048 --> 00:39:22,345
Yellow leather!

448
00:39:23,714 --> 00:39:26,146
They're the most beautiful!

449
00:39:26,581 --> 00:39:29,047
You'll end up preferring them
to the others.

450
00:39:30,047 --> 00:39:31,445
Thank you, Monsieur.

451
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:36,072
Give me your hand and come
sit down.

452
00:39:41,578 --> 00:39:43,875
All this must seem odd to you.

453
00:39:44,877 --> 00:39:49,105
But at my age I can indulge
a few whims, can't I?

454
00:39:49,811 --> 00:39:51,607
For example...

455
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:54,476
Your boots are dirty.

456
00:39:55,176 --> 00:39:58,473
I don't find it proper for a lady
to wax her boots.

457
00:39:59,975 --> 00:40:02,305
I respect women too much for that.

458
00:40:03,241 --> 00:40:04,935
So these dear little boots...

459
00:40:06,108 --> 00:40:08,131
will be waxed by me.

460
00:40:10,207 --> 00:40:14,071
Now get up...
and walk.

461
00:40:16,072 --> 00:40:17,369
Walk over there.

462
00:40:17,772 --> 00:40:19,898
Please lift your skirt a little.

463
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:25,805
Go on, walk!

464
00:40:39,602 --> 00:40:42,125
Let me see
those tiny boots move.

465
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:50,761
Let me see them live.
My "Rose des vents. " <i>Rediviva!</i>

466
00:40:54,299 --> 00:40:55,391
Show me the sole.

467
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:01,598
There are some holes.

468
00:41:01,965 --> 00:41:04,658
I'll mend them
and they'll be like new.

469
00:41:04,964 --> 00:41:06,521
That will do, Marie.

470
00:41:07,364 --> 00:41:10,525
Now come sit down.

471
00:41:11,663 --> 00:41:14,925
Give me those little boots,
right this instant.

472
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:17,153
I'll remove them

473
00:41:18,263 --> 00:41:22,525
and take them with me,
these dear little boots!

474
00:41:24,162 --> 00:41:25,924
- Who is it?
- Me, Father!

475
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:27,118
What is it?

476
00:41:27,261 --> 00:41:29,387
Will you have breakfast with me?

477
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,754
Shall I send it up?

478
00:41:32,093 --> 00:41:33,855
No, please leave me alone!

479
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,860
What are you looking for?

480
00:42:36,866 --> 00:42:38,696
Madame wants some
wine for mass.

481
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:42,088
It's ready.
You only had to ask.

482
00:42:52,863 --> 00:42:53,886
You bastard!

483
00:42:55,263 --> 00:42:56,696
You're the house informer,
are you?

484
00:42:57,563 --> 00:42:59,257
Nothing disgusts me more!

485
00:42:59,929 --> 00:43:01,418
I've worked here 15 years.

486
00:43:06,427 --> 00:43:07,553
I've got their trust.

487
00:43:08,261 --> 00:43:11,126
And that's more important to me
than anything else.

488
00:43:12,094 --> 00:43:15,117
You can't understand.
I have my reasons.

489
00:43:19,325 --> 00:43:20,849
So I take the blame!

490
00:43:21,425 --> 00:43:23,051
Want to know something?

491
00:43:24,025 --> 00:43:24,855
Go ahead.

492
00:43:25,358 --> 00:43:27,847
You're old and ugly,
and you make me sick!

493
00:43:30,158 --> 00:43:32,784
And you're one hell of a
beautiful girl.

494
00:43:38,089 --> 00:43:39,181
The wine!

495
00:43:51,254 --> 00:43:54,244
And you're obedient, too.
I like that.

496
00:44:15,333 --> 00:44:16,027
See you tonight, Monsieur.

497
00:44:48,427 --> 00:44:50,326
That's for you, Father.

498
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:54,959
Good,
I was just about out.

499
00:44:56,027 --> 00:44:59,789
Have some cake, too.
With orange blossom water.

500
00:45:00,026 --> 00:45:01,686
You're spoiling me.
You're too kind.

501
00:45:02,459 --> 00:45:04,323
I saw Mr. Monteil as I arrived.

502
00:45:04,525 --> 00:45:05,684
He's getting some exercise.

503
00:45:05,825 --> 00:45:08,257
He needs to work off his energy.

504
00:45:08,624 --> 00:45:12,022
- Mr. Monteil is a very vigorous man.
- Yes, unfortunately!

505
00:45:12,523 --> 00:45:14,955
Why "unfortunately"?

506
00:45:15,290 --> 00:45:16,779
Come sit down, Father.

507
00:45:17,923 --> 00:45:20,446
He has a strong constitution,
you understand?

508
00:45:21,122 --> 00:45:22,952
This is hard to say...

509
00:45:23,755 --> 00:45:28,188
You can speak to me.
I'm not only your confessor but your friend.

510
00:45:28,388 --> 00:45:30,581
It's true, you have my
complete trust.

511
00:45:32,153 --> 00:45:33,415
Please have a seat.

512
00:45:38,087 --> 00:45:42,019
My husband is demanding.
He's very strong and active.

513
00:45:42,418 --> 00:45:44,647
But I'm unable to satisfy his needs.

514
00:45:45,085 --> 00:45:47,018
I can't.
Really I can't!

515
00:45:48,951 --> 00:45:50,383
It's too painful for me.

516
00:45:52,551 --> 00:45:57,040
If I understand you,
I don't see what I can do for you.

517
00:45:57,249 --> 00:45:58,341
Advise me.

518
00:45:58,682 --> 00:46:00,410
But how?
What can I say?

519
00:46:00,849 --> 00:46:03,509
I don't really know.
At times, it's so hard.

520
00:46:06,915 --> 00:46:09,814
I mean,
perhaps there are other ways...

521
00:46:09,947 --> 00:46:12,346
Relations that more...
less...

522
00:46:13,847 --> 00:46:15,507
Certain caresses that...

523
00:46:18,013 --> 00:46:21,911
Be more precise.
There are caresses... and caresses!

524
00:46:23,179 --> 00:46:24,611
How frequent?

525
00:46:26,411 --> 00:46:28,139
My husband's so robust.

526
00:46:29,677 --> 00:46:31,144
Twice a week, perhaps.

527
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:34,275
Twice a week!
That's too much, much too much!

528
00:46:35,243 --> 00:46:38,676
No matter how robust he is
it's not twice a week that he needs...

529
00:46:39,443 --> 00:46:42,274
In any case,
I'll say this much:

530
00:46:42,642 --> 00:46:45,404
<i>You</i> mustn't derive any pleasure!

531
00:46:45,742 --> 00:46:48,708
On that point, Father,
you can set your mind at rest.

532
00:46:50,507 --> 00:46:54,837
Well, Madame, do you know
our church roof is damaged?

533
00:46:55,773 --> 00:46:58,262
It must be repaired before
winter comes.

534
00:46:58,839 --> 00:47:01,305
Madame,
can you come upstairs?

535
00:47:03,539 --> 00:47:05,130
What is it, Celestine?

536
00:47:05,871 --> 00:47:06,997
It's Mr. Rabour!

537
00:47:08,938 --> 00:47:10,870
- My father...
- Please!

538
00:47:16,704 --> 00:47:20,000
Monsieur, come out!

539
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:29,329
I wanted to do his room but
he doesn't answer.

540
00:47:30,135 --> 00:47:32,533
- You sure he's there?
- The door's locked on the inside.

541
00:47:33,534 --> 00:47:35,364
- And through the office?
- Locked, too.

542
00:47:41,966 --> 00:47:42,989
Father!

543
00:47:47,132 --> 00:47:50,587
You were with him an hour ago.
Was anything wrong?

544
00:47:50,898 --> 00:47:53,387
No, he was as normal
as he usually is.

545
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:54,688
What's wrong?

546
00:47:55,030 --> 00:47:56,929
I don't know.
Maybe he had an attack.

547
00:47:57,230 --> 00:47:58,060
It's locked?

548
00:47:59,063 --> 00:48:00,529
Then I'll force the door.

549
00:48:01,029 --> 00:48:03,086
Joseph can open it
without much damage.

550
00:48:03,429 --> 00:48:05,419
But he's out delivering
the wine kegs.

551
00:48:05,862 --> 00:48:08,125
You mustn't panic.
Let Mr. Monteil do it.

552
00:48:08,461 --> 00:48:09,484
Come this way.

553
00:48:23,292 --> 00:48:24,724
Goddamn!

554
00:48:28,824 --> 00:48:30,518
We should get a locksmith.

555
00:48:30,891 --> 00:48:32,289
No time!

556
00:48:33,957 --> 00:48:36,514
- May I, Father?
- Go ahead, child.

557
00:49:55,211 --> 00:49:56,233
Hello, Joseph!

558
00:49:58,410 --> 00:49:59,842
Roaming around the woods again?

559
00:50:00,509 --> 00:50:02,442
Look, snails!
Want them?

560
00:50:04,609 --> 00:50:05,473
No, thanks.

561
00:50:06,075 --> 00:50:07,405
Some blackberries?

562
00:50:08,042 --> 00:50:09,508
I'll take you back.

563
00:50:10,308 --> 00:50:11,706
No, I'm not finished.

564
00:50:12,907 --> 00:50:15,396
Too bad!
I'm going.

565
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:21,267
Watch out for wolves!

566
00:51:38,693 --> 00:51:41,285
40,000 francs
in inheritance taxes!

567
00:51:41,726 --> 00:51:44,318
I haven't won a game today.

568
00:51:45,292 --> 00:51:47,589
And 352 francs
for the funeral.

569
00:51:51,691 --> 00:51:53,214
Come in, Celestine.

570
00:51:54,525 --> 00:51:56,457
So you're really leaving us?

571
00:51:58,390 --> 00:52:00,289
Going back to Paris?

572
00:52:00,823 --> 00:52:02,483
For now, yes.

573
00:52:03,456 --> 00:52:07,287
A pity. I'd become used to you and
my poor father was fond of you.

574
00:52:08,955 --> 00:52:11,285
I was pleased with your behavior.

575
00:52:12,355 --> 00:52:16,117
If you ever want to come back,
just write to me.

576
00:52:16,454 --> 00:52:17,614
Thank you, Madame.

577
00:52:18,387 --> 00:52:19,376
Farewell.

578
00:52:49,415 --> 00:52:51,472
- Hello, Adolph!
- How are you?

579
00:52:52,515 --> 00:52:54,311
- Got a minute?
- Why?

580
00:52:54,614 --> 00:52:56,581
- We wanna talk to you.
- What about?

581
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:00,247
So, Fransois,
found that little girl yet?

582
00:53:00,547 --> 00:53:02,241
- We found her.
- Good!

583
00:53:02,546 --> 00:53:04,775
We found her but
she was dead.

584
00:53:07,112 --> 00:53:08,204
What's that?

585
00:53:08,778 --> 00:53:09,972
What did she die of?

586
00:53:10,578 --> 00:53:12,976
- Murdered.
- Worse still, she was raped.

587
00:53:13,511 --> 00:53:16,808
- If you'd seen what we just saw!
- Horrible!

588
00:53:17,410 --> 00:53:19,377
You talking about Claire?

589
00:53:20,643 --> 00:53:21,632
When did it happen?

590
00:53:22,176 --> 00:53:26,336
The coroner says 6 days ago,
in other words, last Saturday.

591
00:53:26,775 --> 00:53:29,207
The day your employer died!

592
00:53:30,041 --> 00:53:32,133
- Where'd they find her?
- In the Raillon Woods.

593
00:53:33,142 --> 00:53:35,801
So we'd like to know

594
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:38,907
if you noticed anything that day.

595
00:53:46,372 --> 00:53:50,498
Hey, Rose!
Gossiping again?

596
00:53:51,438 --> 00:53:52,904
- Any letters?
- Two, Captain.

597
00:53:54,037 --> 00:53:55,867
I bet the bastard's still around.

598
00:53:56,138 --> 00:53:57,468
He's not that dumb!

599
00:53:57,804 --> 00:54:00,032
Nobody here
could do such a thing.

600
00:54:00,303 --> 00:54:03,099
If her aunt had raised her right,
she'd be alive now.

601
00:54:03,536 --> 00:54:05,662
She's too poor for 'em
to find her killer.

602
00:54:06,069 --> 00:54:09,229
Hey, you, don't you get snide
about French justice!

603
00:54:10,568 --> 00:54:12,057
So, Celestine,
missed your train?

604
00:54:13,068 --> 00:54:14,126
So stay a minute!

605
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:22,698
- You staying?
- I changed my mind.

606
00:54:23,199 --> 00:54:24,393
That's great!

607
00:54:24,699 --> 00:54:25,722
Heard the news?

608
00:54:26,665 --> 00:54:29,530
I hear her belly was split open
with a knife.

609
00:54:29,764 --> 00:54:31,958
Yeah, so Pantois said.
He found her.

610
00:54:32,431 --> 00:54:33,557
She was butchered.

611
00:54:34,064 --> 00:54:36,531
Why'd she always go into
the woods alone?

612
00:54:36,997 --> 00:54:38,429
Who could've done it?

613
00:54:39,196 --> 00:54:40,458
And rape her, too!

614
00:54:40,763 --> 00:54:44,321
I say it was those 2 monks
who came through here last week.

615
00:54:44,863 --> 00:54:47,988
They were begging.
Pretty unorthodox!

616
00:54:48,195 --> 00:54:51,094
Monks? You can't mean it!
Such holy souls!

617
00:54:51,328 --> 00:54:52,954
Wanna know what I think?

618
00:54:54,495 --> 00:54:55,961
I'm not sure of this,

619
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:59,427
but remember the Jesureau girl last year!
She almost got it!

620
00:55:00,993 --> 00:55:03,789
If I was a policeman,
I'd check next door.

621
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:06,019
You mean Mr. Monteil?

622
00:55:06,892 --> 00:55:08,984
Good Lord,
he'd be too scared!

623
00:55:09,258 --> 00:55:10,520
That don't hold water.

624
00:55:12,492 --> 00:55:13,514
What do you think?

625
00:55:14,757 --> 00:55:15,689
Nothing.

626
00:55:16,390 --> 00:55:18,448
All I know is I was very fond
of that girl.

627
00:55:19,390 --> 00:55:21,016
So sweet and innocent!

628
00:55:23,156 --> 00:55:25,055
If I could get my hands
on her killer!

629
00:55:27,555 --> 00:55:28,613
See you soon.

630
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:35,182
I gotta continue my rounds.
So long!

631
00:55:35,754 --> 00:55:38,346
Where does she get the money
to dress like that?

632
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:25,274
Madame doesn't understand
why you came back.

633
00:56:26,013 --> 00:56:27,570
- Why did you?
- Because!

634
00:56:59,107 --> 00:57:02,699
You did right to come back.
That was nice of you.

635
00:57:06,373 --> 00:57:07,566
Let me do that for you.

636
00:57:11,405 --> 00:57:12,837
I like 'em that way too.

637
00:57:14,604 --> 00:57:17,070
You never really know people
when you meet 'em.

638
00:57:18,571 --> 00:57:20,367
Women especially are hell
to get to know.

639
00:57:23,503 --> 00:57:24,969
But now I know you well.

640
00:57:26,636 --> 00:57:27,659
You know me?

641
00:57:29,235 --> 00:57:30,497
Then tell me what I am.

642
00:57:31,402 --> 00:57:32,391
What you are?

643
00:57:34,434 --> 00:57:35,594
You're like me.

644
00:57:37,268 --> 00:57:38,098
Like you?

645
00:57:40,001 --> 00:57:42,933
I don't mean in looks.
I'm old and ugly.

646
00:57:44,699 --> 00:57:46,256
But deep down inside,
we're alike.

647
00:57:47,766 --> 00:57:49,027
I know what I'm talking about.

648
00:58:02,530 --> 00:58:05,087
The boss died on a Saturday,
right?

649
00:58:06,096 --> 00:58:07,063
I think so.

650
00:58:09,129 --> 00:58:11,391
The day you delivered
the wine kegs?

651
00:58:15,361 --> 00:58:16,293
Could be.

652
00:58:17,561 --> 00:58:19,118
It was the day little Claire died.

653
00:58:21,194 --> 00:58:24,058
- Did you go through the Raillon Woods?
- Sure.

654
00:58:25,193 --> 00:58:26,682
It's the shortest way.

655
00:58:29,025 --> 00:58:30,992
You didn't happen to see Claire?

656
00:58:33,958 --> 00:58:35,447
You damn women!

657
00:58:36,857 --> 00:58:40,120
You ought to think about
other things.

658
00:58:49,322 --> 00:58:52,550
But think what you will,
you and I are alike.

659
00:58:53,421 --> 00:58:54,853
Our souls are alike.

660
00:59:44,579 --> 00:59:46,273
Ah, the flowers...
Thank you.

661
00:59:54,045 --> 00:59:54,909
Look!

662
00:59:56,711 --> 00:59:57,405
You see?

663
01:00:01,710 --> 01:00:02,540
Don't!

664
01:00:02,677 --> 01:00:04,803
This time I'll break his neck.

665
01:00:05,076 --> 01:00:06,441
But we're in mourning!

666
01:00:06,677 --> 01:00:08,666
- So what?
- Get in!

667
01:00:34,271 --> 01:00:35,203
Say, Rose.

668
01:00:37,004 --> 01:00:38,903
- I gave you how much yesterday?
- 25 francs.

669
01:00:40,771 --> 01:00:42,794
- I'm 38 cents short.
- I didn't take 'em!

670
01:00:42,937 --> 01:00:43,960
No, the cat did!

671
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,694
This is an unexpected visit.
What brings you here?

672
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:05,093
I have errands to do.

673
01:01:05,733 --> 01:01:08,325
- Haven't you gone too far?
- Me?

674
01:01:08,866 --> 01:01:11,026
Yesterday
you threw more trash over.

675
01:01:11,165 --> 01:01:14,326
You just missed
hitting my employer.

676
01:01:14,598 --> 01:01:16,588
I won't use kid-gloves
with that bastard!

677
01:01:17,298 --> 01:01:20,026
- Won't you come in a moment?
- I have my errands.

678
01:01:20,730 --> 01:01:23,196
So the cobbler
kicked the bucket!

679
01:01:23,730 --> 01:01:25,662
- Who?
- The old man.

680
01:01:26,196 --> 01:01:28,219
- You've no right to talk like that.
- Why shouldn't I?

681
01:01:31,962 --> 01:01:34,224
- Know what you ought to do?
- What?

682
01:01:34,895 --> 01:01:36,623
File a suit against Monteil.

683
01:01:37,228 --> 01:01:39,286
- A suit?
- You bet. Hit him hard!

684
01:01:39,594 --> 01:01:42,117
- Indecent conduct!
- But there's no reason!

685
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:44,255
What difference does it make?

686
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:47,591
- I can't do that!
- But it's easy as pie.

687
01:01:48,126 --> 01:01:50,991
You go to the police
and Rose and I act as witnesses.

688
01:01:51,392 --> 01:01:53,882
We'll swear we saw everything.

689
01:01:54,058 --> 01:01:56,287
- What did you see?
- Don't worry.

690
01:01:57,292 --> 01:02:00,156
A soldier's word means something,
especially nowadays.

691
01:02:01,424 --> 01:02:05,016
And it'll be easy to tack on
that rape business.

692
01:02:05,956 --> 01:02:08,650
- Little Claire!
- You're not being serious.

693
01:02:09,189 --> 01:02:12,280
I'm just saying what I'd do
in your shoes.

694
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:22,143
One more thing...

695
01:02:22,921 --> 01:02:25,319
When Rose is out,
come by and see me.

696
01:02:26,420 --> 01:02:29,012
- Just a thought, too.
- What an idea!

697
01:02:29,486 --> 01:02:30,646
You must come.

698
01:02:32,486 --> 01:02:33,417
Promise?

699
01:02:54,248 --> 01:02:56,181
JUSTICE OF THE PEACE

700
01:03:00,781 --> 01:03:03,145
I agreed to answer this summons,

701
01:03:04,214 --> 01:03:07,078
but first I want to know if
the gentleman has witnesses.

702
01:03:08,146 --> 01:03:09,010
Witnesses?

703
01:03:10,879 --> 01:03:13,539
The crap he throws all day
is my witness!

704
01:03:14,711 --> 01:03:16,076
What do you say,
Captain?

705
01:03:18,244 --> 01:03:21,370
On my word as a soldier,
I threw nothing on his property.

706
01:03:22,744 --> 01:03:23,676
Nothing?

707
01:03:26,709 --> 01:03:27,801
That's a bit much!

708
01:03:28,542 --> 01:03:30,441
He never stops,
morning to night!

709
01:03:30,875 --> 01:03:32,536
Everyone know it's his stuff.

710
01:03:32,975 --> 01:03:34,033
You held on to it?

711
01:03:34,541 --> 01:03:36,599
Why hold on to old hats?
I burned them.

712
01:03:37,408 --> 01:03:38,669
Well?

713
01:03:40,041 --> 01:03:43,030
Everyone knows he cuts my trees!
He lays traps for my cats!

714
01:03:44,140 --> 01:03:45,572
And he lies through his teeth.

715
01:03:46,373 --> 01:03:48,101
- You calling me a liar?
- And how!

716
01:03:48,473 --> 01:03:49,496
You hooligan!

717
01:03:49,872 --> 01:03:50,770
Hear that?

718
01:03:51,106 --> 01:03:52,504
Keep calm.

719
01:03:53,205 --> 01:03:56,968
Mr. Monteil,
it's most unlikely that a valiant soldier,

720
01:03:57,105 --> 01:04:00,265
an officer who won his stripes
on the battlefield,

721
01:04:00,404 --> 01:04:03,337
would toss hats into your garden,
like a schoolboy.

722
01:04:03,670 --> 01:04:05,137
He's insulted the Army!

723
01:04:05,470 --> 01:04:07,096
Let's keep calm.

724
01:04:07,769 --> 01:04:09,736
And you've brought no proof.

725
01:04:10,103 --> 01:04:11,126
You scoundrel!

726
01:04:11,269 --> 01:04:13,133
Upstart!
Shirker!

727
01:04:13,402 --> 01:04:16,062
I served in the war!

728
01:04:16,635 --> 01:04:18,863
- At the Invalides!
- So? Is that a disgrace?

729
01:04:19,134 --> 01:04:21,101
Enough, gentlemen!

730
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:34,193
- Miss Rose!
- Hello, Father!

731
01:04:34,431 --> 01:04:36,591
- How's the captain?
- As hardy as ever!

732
01:04:41,697 --> 01:04:42,664
What?

733
01:04:43,097 --> 01:04:47,427
I hope we'll have nice flowers for
the altar at Corpus Christi.

734
01:04:47,596 --> 01:04:49,153
Certainly, Father!

735
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:50,890
Respects to the Captain!

736
01:05:03,394 --> 01:05:04,587
How did it go?

737
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:08,756
Tonight you'll cook us a rabbit
in white wine.

738
01:05:09,993 --> 01:05:11,459
Lord, what a child!

739
01:05:34,755 --> 01:05:37,244
Come with me.

740
01:05:38,455 --> 01:05:39,716
Me?

741
01:05:51,153 --> 01:05:52,483
Where are we going?

742
01:06:11,083 --> 01:06:13,947
It smells of cows.
But it's so orderly here.

743
01:06:14,949 --> 01:06:16,280
More orderly than you think!

744
01:06:21,614 --> 01:06:24,672
Give me a hand.
I'm not much good at mending.

745
01:06:25,180 --> 01:06:27,737
- Why ask me?
- I'd rather you did it.

746
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:29,912
Everything's on the table.

747
01:06:30,246 --> 01:06:31,974
I'm not your servant!

748
01:06:32,346 --> 01:06:33,903
If you don't want to, tough!

749
01:06:42,411 --> 01:06:44,344
Next time you snoop
through my things,

750
01:06:45,144 --> 01:06:46,508
leave them the way you find them.

751
01:06:47,543 --> 01:06:51,237
These match boxes were like this.

752
01:06:51,943 --> 01:06:55,341
What were you looking for?

753
01:06:58,142 --> 01:07:00,301
And I see you went through
my chest.

754
01:07:02,541 --> 01:07:04,235
You've got a lot of nerve!

755
01:07:06,173 --> 01:07:07,833
Got some bad ideas about me?

756
01:07:10,439 --> 01:07:13,997
Snoop through everything!
My underclothes, my closet!

757
01:07:14,439 --> 01:07:17,303
Even in here!
You won't find a thing!

758
01:07:17,538 --> 01:07:18,970
- Think so?
- You bet!

759
01:07:20,605 --> 01:07:21,832
Now listen...

760
01:07:23,237 --> 01:07:25,636
I think it was you
who killed little Claire.

761
01:07:29,536 --> 01:07:31,799
See?
It's like I said.

762
01:07:32,503 --> 01:07:33,901
You've got bad ideas
about me.

763
01:07:34,969 --> 01:07:38,163
I know what goes on in your mind.
Your every thought!

764
01:07:39,468 --> 01:07:41,525
- You scare me.
- Why?

765
01:07:42,734 --> 01:07:44,360
I think you're a crook.

766
01:07:44,834 --> 01:07:47,266
A crook, me?
Are you serious?

767
01:07:47,934 --> 01:07:49,991
Look around!
I love the army!

768
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:51,698
Religion!
Law and order!

769
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:53,427
My country,
above all!

770
01:07:56,998 --> 01:08:00,090
Look at me.
Am I lying when I say I love all that?

771
01:08:01,364 --> 01:08:02,830
No, you're not lying.

772
01:08:03,464 --> 01:08:04,794
Would a crook love all that?

773
01:08:06,130 --> 01:08:09,029
Come now,
admit you killed Claire.

774
01:08:10,696 --> 01:08:11,924
This has nothing
to do with Claire.

775
01:08:15,029 --> 01:08:16,518
It has to do with
you and me now.

776
01:08:17,829 --> 01:08:18,818
I dream about you.

777
01:08:19,562 --> 01:08:21,426
You set my blood on fire,
my dear Celestine.

778
01:08:23,128 --> 01:08:24,924
For me,
there's no one but you.

779
01:08:38,225 --> 01:08:40,317
We have to
get together right away.

780
01:08:40,991 --> 01:08:42,184
We can't just now.

781
01:08:42,791 --> 01:08:43,655
Why not?

782
01:08:45,890 --> 01:08:47,516
I told you already...

783
01:08:48,723 --> 01:08:50,712
- We have to wait a bit.
- What for?

784
01:08:51,323 --> 01:08:52,414
Wait a bit.

785
01:08:53,489 --> 01:08:55,012
If it was only
to have a little fun,

786
01:08:55,689 --> 01:08:57,655
then why not.
But this is serious.

787
01:08:58,454 --> 01:08:59,853
I want you for keeps.

788
01:09:33,949 --> 01:09:35,007
'Night, Monsieur.

789
01:09:59,878 --> 01:10:01,538
Come in.

790
01:10:12,143 --> 01:10:13,040
What do you want?

791
01:10:45,338 --> 01:10:47,964

Yes, he is.
You wish to see him?

01:11:50,327 --> 01:11:52,260
Yes, it's important.

798

01:13:01,648 --> 01:13:03,376
"and in certain cases...

811
01:13:04,614 --> 01:13:07,479
"the immediate removal of
the vehicle. "

812
01:13:08,380 --> 01:13:11,540
I'm in a hurry today.
I'll come again.

813
01:13:17,579 --> 01:13:19,273
Too bad!

814
01:13:31,044 --> 01:13:33,374
Good to see you.
I need to talk to you.

815
01:13:34,843 --> 01:13:35,639
How are you?

816
01:13:36,409 --> 01:13:38,535
- How about a coffee?
- No, I'm in a hurry.

817
01:13:38,809 --> 01:13:40,070
I'll walk with you.

818
01:13:40,509 --> 01:13:43,100
- How's Rose?
- I threw her out.

819
01:13:43,374 --> 01:13:44,773
- What?
- Exactly.

820
01:13:45,141 --> 01:13:47,267
But she's been with you
for 10 years!

821
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:49,568
12 years!

822
01:13:49,807 --> 01:13:51,000
Such a good woman!

823
01:13:51,574 --> 01:13:55,029
She knew your tastes and habits
and was so devoted to you.

824
01:13:55,272 --> 01:13:59,205
Sure. I never had asparagus
because Madame didn't like it!

825
01:13:59,372 --> 01:14:02,429
I'd had enough.
She stopped doing work around the house.

826
01:14:03,472 --> 01:14:06,370
Everything belonged to her.
Like my Voltaire armchair, for instance.

827
01:14:06,504 --> 01:14:08,698
She was always in it.
She took everything.

828
01:14:09,537 --> 01:14:13,526
I had nothing left,
dammit!

829
01:14:16,536 --> 01:14:18,593
And whenever I spoke to you,

830
01:14:19,635 --> 01:14:21,363
I wouldn't hear the last of it.

831
01:14:22,502 --> 01:14:23,695
She was jealous.

832
01:14:25,068 --> 01:14:26,500
What'll you do now?

833
01:14:26,867 --> 01:14:29,096
That depends on you.

834
01:14:29,633 --> 01:14:30,622
On me?

835
01:14:31,667 --> 01:14:33,133
Yes,
on you alone.

836
01:14:34,166 --> 01:14:35,133
How?

837
01:14:38,399 --> 01:14:41,389
Let's be frank,
like soldiers.

838
01:14:42,398 --> 01:14:44,831
Do you want me
to marry you?

839
01:14:46,198 --> 01:14:48,426
- You, marry me?
- Why not?

840
01:14:49,163 --> 01:14:52,130
I know I'm older.
How old are you?

841
01:14:52,363 --> 01:14:53,488
- 32.
- So?

842
01:14:55,362 --> 01:14:58,590
- I can't cook very well.
- We'll hire a cook.

843
01:14:59,229 --> 01:15:02,093
Besides, there's cooking
and cooking.

844
01:15:02,628 --> 01:15:04,821
That's not what I need from you.

845
01:15:04,961 --> 01:15:05,859
So what do you say?

846
01:15:06,627 --> 01:15:09,253
I don't know.
Let me think it over.

847
01:15:10,194 --> 01:15:12,353
Right.
Think it over.

848
01:15:13,326 --> 01:15:14,418
But quick!

849
01:15:26,924 --> 01:15:27,982
What time is it?

850
01:15:29,624 --> 01:15:30,591
Can't you see?

851
01:15:31,590 --> 01:15:32,920
Pass the wine, please.

852
01:15:33,823 --> 01:15:35,188
You drink too much,
I told you.

853
01:15:47,721 --> 01:15:51,347
- Celestine's not here?
- She's in bed with a headache.

854
01:16:01,952 --> 01:16:02,918
That will do.

855
01:16:07,851 --> 01:16:09,340
I told you I hate herb tea
in the evening.

856
01:17:18,140 --> 01:17:20,629
What you're doing's not right.
I mean it.

857
01:17:25,738 --> 01:17:26,670
Like I told you,

858
01:17:27,505 --> 01:17:28,903
if it's just to have some fun,

859
01:17:29,771 --> 01:17:32,067
sure, right away.
I wouldn't hesitate.

860
01:17:32,904 --> 01:17:33,961
I've known women,

861
01:17:35,003 --> 01:17:36,367
but it's not the same with you.

862
01:17:37,170 --> 01:17:38,864
- I got plans for you.
- What plans?

863
01:17:39,202 --> 01:17:40,362
- Plans.
- What kind?

864
01:17:43,169 --> 01:17:44,829
I'd like you to be my wife.

865
01:17:45,468 --> 01:17:46,764
Me,
your wife?

866
01:17:47,368 --> 01:17:50,459
I've thought it out.
That's why I'm waiting for the priest to come.

867
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,728
I've found a good deal for us:

868
01:17:56,433 --> 01:17:59,298
a cafй, for sale back home
in Cherbourg.

869
01:17:59,433 --> 01:18:01,059
It's a military town.

870
01:18:01,532 --> 01:18:04,794
Business is good.
I guarantee you we can make a mint.

871
01:18:05,465 --> 01:18:07,761
With a wife like you,
sweet

872
01:18:07,898 --> 01:18:09,626
and cute!
Would you like to?

873
01:18:10,164 --> 01:18:11,562
Me?
But...

874
01:18:11,897 --> 01:18:14,090
You're the kind I need,
a woman of order.

875
01:18:14,497 --> 01:18:16,895
Plus you're nice and not bashful.

876
01:18:19,029 --> 01:18:21,859
You'll have every garrison
at your feet.

877
01:18:22,462 --> 01:18:24,292
You want me to be a whore
for you?

878
01:18:25,328 --> 01:18:28,692
Don't look at it that way.
It's a terrific opportunity.

879
01:18:29,660 --> 01:18:33,388
I'm telling you now but it won't happen
for another 4 or 6 months.

880
01:18:33,761 --> 01:18:36,250
- Why not now?
- Because we gotta wait.

881
01:18:36,793 --> 01:18:40,782
The cafй,
needs a paint job.

882
01:18:42,391 --> 01:18:45,153
We could call it
"At the French Army. "

883
01:18:45,858 --> 01:18:47,223
Got the money?

884
01:18:48,191 --> 01:18:51,282
Some.
But not here.

885
01:18:52,657 --> 01:18:55,817
I don't know just how much.
But "money begets money. "

886
01:18:56,423 --> 01:18:58,787
And sometimes,
politics pays.

887
01:18:59,756 --> 01:19:02,848
And there's something else,
very important.

888
01:19:03,322 --> 01:19:04,345
I'll tell you another time.

889
01:19:06,554 --> 01:19:07,782
I gotta have that cafй.

890
01:19:10,154 --> 01:19:11,314
Revolution's around the corner.

891
01:19:12,221 --> 01:19:13,847
There's nothing better for a cafй!

892
01:19:27,917 --> 01:19:29,884
If I say yes to the cafй...

893
01:19:31,417 --> 01:19:32,884
Would you want to now?

894
01:19:34,383 --> 01:19:37,372
I'm stubborn.
What I say once, I mean for keeps.

895
01:19:38,182 --> 01:19:39,205
I know!

896
01:19:39,716 --> 01:19:40,977
I've heard it often enough.

897
01:19:41,548 --> 01:19:44,276
I'm fed up with you
and everybody here!

898
01:19:44,648 --> 01:19:46,205
I'm leaving,
and right away!

899
01:19:47,048 --> 01:19:48,947
Find someone else for your cafй.

900
01:19:49,380 --> 01:19:50,870
There's no one but you.

901
01:19:51,314 --> 01:19:54,145
Even if you got bad ideas on me,
I'm sure of that.

902
01:19:56,146 --> 01:19:57,113
Listen good!

903
01:19:58,979 --> 01:20:01,208
If you swear...
on this...

904
01:20:02,312 --> 01:20:05,006
that you'll be my wife,
then OK.

905
01:20:08,444 --> 01:20:09,467
You swear?

906
01:20:14,977 --> 01:20:15,908
Good.

907
01:20:42,972 --> 01:20:44,962
And now,
my dear Joseph,

908
01:20:45,772 --> 01:20:48,034
tell me you killed little Claire.

909
01:20:48,971 --> 01:20:50,097
Shut up!

910
01:21:11,934 --> 01:21:14,332
You should go hunting
and let me work in peace.

911
01:21:15,801 --> 01:21:17,324
- I'd like to.
- Well then?

912
01:21:18,633 --> 01:21:19,793
I'm out of cartridges.

913
01:21:21,232 --> 01:21:24,131
- I need to buy some but...
- I gave you 15 francs Monday.

914
01:21:25,365 --> 01:21:27,161
- All gone.
- Too bad!

915
01:22:00,427 --> 01:22:01,393
Come with me.

916
01:22:14,557 --> 01:22:17,217
What's all this?

917
01:22:18,523 --> 01:22:22,819
Celestine and I
are going to be married.

918
01:22:23,755 --> 01:22:25,313
You're marrying Celestine?

919
01:22:26,488 --> 01:22:27,546
Is this serious?

920
01:22:28,921 --> 01:22:30,820
How nice!
But your service?

921
01:22:31,321 --> 01:22:33,378
Madame needn't worry,
it's not for a while.

922
01:22:34,120 --> 01:22:36,916
Not for a few months yet,
till you find replacements.

923
01:22:37,420 --> 01:22:38,546
For whatever time it takes.

924
01:22:39,119 --> 01:22:42,280
We'll miss you, Joseph.
You too, Celestine.

925
01:22:43,319 --> 01:22:45,251
I hope you'll both be happy.

926
01:22:54,483 --> 01:22:56,746
We may move to Cherbourg.

927
01:22:57,450 --> 01:22:59,280
I'm interested in a business there.

928
01:23:00,016 --> 01:23:01,607
I'll take the dog out.

929
01:23:02,482 --> 01:23:05,278
We should have an engagement party
one of these days.

930
01:23:06,182 --> 01:23:10,046
While you're here,
help me move this table.

931
01:23:10,381 --> 01:23:12,041
Take the vase,
Celestine.

932
01:23:12,781 --> 01:23:14,338
Move that.

933
01:23:17,780 --> 01:23:19,542
Careful,
it's very heavy.

934
01:23:22,546 --> 01:23:23,604
Watch the rug!

935
01:23:43,976 --> 01:23:45,408
So, Marianne,
laundry all right?

936
01:23:50,975 --> 01:23:52,737
Bet you were up to mischief
as a girl!

937
01:23:53,441 --> 01:23:55,464
Me, Monsieur?
Mischief?

938
01:23:56,273 --> 01:23:57,967
I've worked all my life.

939
01:23:58,273 --> 01:23:59,739
You're a woman like all women.

940
01:24:00,407 --> 01:24:02,135
I like to have fun, too.

941
01:24:06,538 --> 01:24:07,527
I'm all for love.

942
01:24:08,838 --> 01:24:10,236
<i>Amour fou</i>

943
01:24:13,204 --> 01:24:14,397
I mean it, Marianne.

944
01:24:16,237 --> 01:24:17,726
You've been on my mind
a long time.

945
01:24:19,370 --> 01:24:20,529
I've been watching you.

946
01:24:23,869 --> 01:24:27,324
Say I come to your room tonight.

947
01:24:31,135 --> 01:24:32,124
What d'you say?

948
01:24:34,067 --> 01:24:35,364
Around 10?

949
01:24:37,367 --> 01:24:38,560
You little minx, you!

950
01:25:01,063 --> 01:25:01,859
Come here.

951
01:25:06,762 --> 01:25:07,524
What, Monsieur?

952
01:25:08,461 --> 01:25:10,485
Get in there!

953
01:26:32,148 --> 01:26:33,705
Quiet, Bobby!

954
01:26:43,612 --> 01:26:45,670
- Who is it?
- Just the sexton.

955
01:26:46,846 --> 01:26:47,868
Come in.

956
01:26:56,044 --> 01:26:57,943
Don't mind her.
We can talk.

957
01:26:58,077 --> 01:26:58,873
Have a seat.

958
01:27:03,976 --> 01:27:07,204
- The rally still set for Sunday?
- Still.

959
01:27:07,775 --> 01:27:10,332
If we leave here at 4 a. m.
we can be there by 9.

960
01:27:10,842 --> 01:27:12,536
This time their ears'll whistle!

961
01:27:13,442 --> 01:27:17,499
I made myself this.

962
01:27:17,773 --> 01:27:19,831
- Taking it?
- Sure! Got the leaflets?

963
01:27:20,074 --> 01:27:22,040
Yes.
Here...

964
01:27:22,506 --> 01:27:23,938
- How many?
- 250.

965
01:27:24,373 --> 01:27:25,771
We each take half.

966
01:27:26,839 --> 01:27:30,794
We'll hand 'em out to the republicans too
even if they throw us out.

967
01:27:37,004 --> 01:27:38,664
- The police!
- What do they want?

968
01:27:39,870 --> 01:27:40,995
Who knows?

969
01:27:57,901 --> 01:28:00,867
Sit here.

970
01:28:07,799 --> 01:28:10,630
'Evening, Sergeant.
What brings you here?

971
01:28:11,265 --> 01:28:15,322
We were passing by and figured,
"Joseph might offer us a drink!"

972
01:28:15,864 --> 01:28:19,319
- To warm us up!
- I got just the thing here.

973
01:28:19,730 --> 01:28:21,560
Nights are chilly now.

974
01:28:22,096 --> 01:28:25,086
We're OK in the sun,
but at dusk it starts to freeze.

975
01:28:25,695 --> 01:28:27,218
That's how you catch a cold!

976
01:28:28,162 --> 01:28:31,254
Nice place you got here.
Spotless!

977
01:28:32,195 --> 01:28:35,423
If your room was this neat,

978
01:28:35,561 --> 01:28:37,686
you'd find your belt quicker
in the morning!

979
01:28:39,627 --> 01:28:41,093
Cheers!

980
01:28:43,592 --> 01:28:45,525
- Cheers!
- To your health!

981
01:28:46,092 --> 01:28:47,582
Your health,
mam'zelle!

982
01:28:48,592 --> 01:28:49,751
Thanks.

983
01:28:52,491 --> 01:28:54,889
- A refill?
- No, we gotta go.

984
01:28:56,058 --> 01:29:00,649
Too bad! It's nice and warm here.
But duty calls!

985
01:29:00,856 --> 01:29:02,789
C'mon,
one for the road!

986
01:29:02,990 --> 01:29:04,456
A quick one, then!

987
01:29:05,723 --> 01:29:07,552
By the way,

988
01:29:07,688 --> 01:29:10,484
the poachers are back
in the region.

989
01:29:11,321 --> 01:29:15,152
If you spot any,
give us a call.

990
01:29:15,387 --> 01:29:16,410
Right.

991
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:19,087
And while I think of it...

992
01:29:19,820 --> 01:29:21,377
remember the day
Mr. Rabour died?

993
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:26,748
Did you go through Raillon Woods
that day?

994
01:29:27,685 --> 01:29:30,277
Maybe.
I'm often in it.

995
01:29:31,085 --> 01:29:32,517
And little Claire?

996
01:29:34,184 --> 01:29:37,208
Did you see her 2 or 3 days before
we found her?

997
01:29:37,650 --> 01:29:39,879
If I did,
I'd have told you.

998
01:29:44,616 --> 01:29:47,082
This piece of metal
mean anything to you?

999
01:29:48,249 --> 01:29:50,307
It's from a shoe.
Let me see.

1000
01:29:51,049 --> 01:29:53,345
Everybody wears 'em.
So do I.

1001
01:29:53,615 --> 01:29:55,275
On all your shoes?

1002
01:30:02,813 --> 01:30:04,939
I lost one.

1003
01:30:06,779 --> 01:30:08,973
- It's mine!
- Yours?

1004
01:30:09,412 --> 01:30:10,606
Looks like it.

1005
01:30:12,311 --> 01:30:14,903
We found it in the grass
this morning,

1006
01:30:15,544 --> 01:30:18,409
right where the girl was killed.
Remember?

1007
01:30:19,943 --> 01:30:21,069
Well, well...

1008
01:30:21,510 --> 01:30:22,772
You're coming with us.

1009
01:30:27,375 --> 01:30:30,739
Bad luck, Celestine.
I didn't wear those shoes that day.

1010
01:30:31,242 --> 01:30:32,334
Take him away.

1011
01:30:34,042 --> 01:30:36,634
- You, too!
- It's nothing to do with me!

1012
01:31:23,767 --> 01:31:24,926
<i>Bastard. </i>

1013
01:32:24,923 --> 01:32:26,117
Nobody move!

1014
01:32:46,386 --> 01:32:49,444
Captain, I'm late.
Please excuse my wife.

1015
01:32:49,586 --> 01:32:51,711
She suddenly felt ill.
I had to stay.

1016
01:32:52,385 --> 01:32:54,284
- Nothing serious?
- No, I doubt it.

1017
01:32:54,918 --> 01:32:56,544
- You'll join us?
- Of course!

1018
01:32:57,285 --> 01:32:59,046
Then kiss the bride.

1019
01:33:02,984 --> 01:33:04,348
This way!

1020
01:33:22,747 --> 01:33:24,043
Wait for me in the stables.

1021
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:26,605
You start on the seedlings.

1022
01:33:39,744 --> 01:33:41,608
Marianne, what are you doing?
You mad?

1023
01:33:42,110 --> 01:33:43,475
I'm watering,
Monsieur.

1024
01:33:44,344 --> 01:33:45,605
Go clean my boots.

1025
01:33:53,141 --> 01:33:54,335
It's not warm this morning.

1026
01:33:55,041 --> 01:33:57,167
- What time is it?
- Around 9.

1027
01:33:57,875 --> 01:33:59,364
Pass me a towel.

1028
01:34:01,207 --> 01:34:03,400
No,
the one on the stand.

1029
01:34:10,472 --> 01:34:13,268
- You look sad. Something wrong?
- No, I'm fine.

1030
01:34:14,872 --> 01:34:16,862
Take the tray away.

1031
01:34:18,004 --> 01:34:19,335
I have some good news for you.

1032
01:34:20,137 --> 01:34:22,161
I did my will long ago,
but it was a mistake.

1033
01:34:22,871 --> 01:34:24,394
I left everything
to the French Academy.

1034
01:34:24,970 --> 01:34:26,369
Idiotic!

1035
01:34:27,136 --> 01:34:30,125
I drew up a new one yesterday.
Wait and see!

1036
01:34:33,735 --> 01:34:35,997
I'm going hunting with Monteil
tomorrow.

1037
01:34:36,535 --> 01:34:38,468
I must admit,
he's a decent fellow!

1038
01:34:40,034 --> 01:34:41,466
Not at all like his wife.

1039
01:34:42,367 --> 01:34:44,266
A goddamn cow!

1040
01:34:45,234 --> 01:34:46,996
And the trial?

1041
01:34:47,466 --> 01:34:48,660
Oh, yes.

1042
01:34:50,799 --> 01:34:54,630
I forgot to tell you.
Things'll work out for Joseph.

1043
01:34:55,599 --> 01:34:58,122
There's no real evidence against him.
He'll be released soon.

1044
01:34:59,231 --> 01:35:00,755
He won't even go to trial.

1045
01:35:01,598 --> 01:35:04,291
I'm not surprised, I know Joseph.
A true patriot!

1046
01:35:05,064 --> 01:35:06,121
Don't you think?

1047
01:35:10,362 --> 01:35:12,386
Unless he's a scoundrel.
That's a possibility.

1048
01:35:20,461 --> 01:35:23,484
Down with the foreigners!

1049
01:35:34,325 --> 01:35:37,883
FRANCE FOR THE FRENCH

1050
01:35:42,990 --> 01:35:45,116
A NOOSE FOR HERRIOT!

1051
01:35:46,389 --> 01:35:48,185
DOWN WITH THE REPUBLIC!

1052
01:35:48,456 --> 01:35:49,888
AT THE FRENCH ARMY

1053
01:35:58,387 --> 01:35:59,820
I'll come by later!

1054
01:36:00,920 --> 01:36:02,512
- What?
- See you later!

1055
01:36:02,954 --> 01:36:03,943
Right!

1056
01:36:18,518 --> 01:36:22,212
Read "L'Action Fransaise"!

1057
01:36:23,017 --> 01:36:25,915
Buy "L'Action Fransaise"!

1058
01:36:43,514 --> 01:36:49,504
Long live Chiappe!
