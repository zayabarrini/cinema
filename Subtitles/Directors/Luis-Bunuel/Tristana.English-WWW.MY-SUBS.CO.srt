1
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:18,452
lt had to be him.

2
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,179
We're sick of you .

3
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,348
Next time,
l'll rip your ears off.

4
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:41,433
For all the use they are. . .

5
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:43,435
Come on.

6
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:55,697
You're always causing trouble.

7
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:59,451
Saturno isn't a bad boy.
A bit confused, but smart.

8
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,620
He has strange ideas at times.

9
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,790
He's just like my late husband,

10
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,626
may he burn in hell.
lf you'll forgiνe me.

11
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:10,629
This young lady is
Don Lope Garrido's ward.

12
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,215
She hasn't left the house
for two weeks.

13
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:15,467
l brought her with me
to get some fresh air.

14
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,344
My pleasure, miss.

15
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:18,887
Excuse me.

16
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:37,531
lt's for my mother.
She died recently.

17
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:53,797
Your son is too old now
to stay on in this school.

18
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:56,216
Yes, it's time he earned his liνing.

19
00:02:56,885 --> 00:03:00,053
He's capable enough,
but he's always skiving.

20
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:02,139
He's easily distracted and very lazy.

21
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,808
But if he matures with the years,

22
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,977
he could be a good craftsman.

23
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,856
Don Lope has found
a place for him in a workshop.

24
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,482
He's a fine gentleman.

25
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,860
There are few like him now.

26
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:21,700
Where is God's grace going?

27
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,578
- To find a sweetheart.
- He's right here, dear.

28
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:25,871
So old?

29
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,334
Not that old!
Don't bury me yet!

30
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,128
Ma'am.

31
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:49,269
Come on, get out of here.

32
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:01,531
You're not taking all this, are you?

33
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:03,825
As you wish.

34
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:06,411
This junk is of no interest.

35
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:10,332
l don't want it in my house.
l'νe got enough. Saturna!

36
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,377
Sell all this to a second-hand dealer.

37
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:16,046
Except for the clothes
that are passable.

38
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:17,839
And don't haggle, l know you.

39
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:20,509
- Take what he offers.
- l'll do that, sir.

40
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:29,434
- lf there's anything you'd like. . .
- Yes, this crucifix.

41
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,979
My mother died with it in her hands.

42
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:36,233
Very well,
but keep it in your room.

43
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:40,320
With time, l'll put certain
superstitions out of your head.

44
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:43,240
Naturally,
if you'd like anything else. . .

45
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:46,493
- No.
- With this and the piano, that's all.

46
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:49,538
The piano?
We sold it months ago.

47
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:59,131
The scores are still here.
l'd like to keep them.

48
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,675
- Perhaps one day. . .
- Very well.

49
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,928
Your mother was a very good woman.

50
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:08,682
No one better,
but no one sillier either.

51
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,727
You never enjoyed
your father's wealth.

52
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:15,480
You were νery young
when he started to lose it all.

53
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:22,321
Leave that saucepan.

54
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,865
l said l didn't want any rubbish.

55
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:29,202
You know nothing about cooking, sir.
l can use this.

56
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,789
You, get ready.
We're leaving now.

57
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:34,541
- So soon?
- Yes.

58
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:38,003
What do you think she said
a while ago?

59
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:41,298
That she'd like to stay on here.

60
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:47,220
Look, l can't maintain two houses
and you can't liνe on your own.

61
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:50,265
Your mother asked me
to look after you.

62
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,601
Where would you be better off
than with me?

63
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:55,729
Who would dare offend you
if you're with me?

64
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,898
Come along.

65
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:19,211
Stop thief!

66
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,464
Catch him!

67
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,979
- Did you see a boy run past?
- With a handbag?

68
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:40,190
- Yes.
- He went that way.

69
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,326
Come.

70
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,995
Why did you send him the wrong way?

71
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:56,998
Because we must protect the weak.

72
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,418
The police represent strength.

73
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:03,130
Men like me always defend the weak,
whoever they are,

74
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:04,881
whateνer their situation.

75
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:08,093
Neνer forget that, little one.

76
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:26,611
She's so beautiful!
And so elegant!

77
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:33,493
She was an upper class lady,
married to a marquis.

78
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:37,038
But Don Lope
got in the middle and. . .

79
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:39,416
- What did he do?
- Challenged her husband.

80
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:40,959
lt was a real scandal.

81
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,586
lt was eνen in the papers.

82
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,421
No one is better than Don Lope,

83
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:47,883
but where there's a skirt,
he has horns and a tail.

84
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,441
Get up, Tristana.

85
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,818
You're not a servant here.

86
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,446
You're the mistress,
Saturna is here to serve you .

87
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,740
Saturna, clean this up.

88
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,996
l'm very tired, l walked a lot.

89
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,581
My feet are aching.

90
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:23,585
- Shall l bring your slippers?
- Thank you, you're an angel.

91
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,637
l know l keep you
at home all the time,

92
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:38,225
but l can't bring you to the cafe,
or let you go out walking.

93
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,186
And your mourning
is a nuisance for eνeryone.

94
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,605
Whenever you wish,
l'll take you to the theater.

95
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,440
lt's up to you.

96
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,359
Thank you, Tristana.

97
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:51,238
Shall l tell you something?
You're my beloνed daughter.

98
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:53,740
l only ask you
to love me like a father.

99
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,408
You're a good man.

100
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,994
Heaνens, a visitor. l'd forgotten.

101
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:03,333
- You're receiving them like that?
- lt doesn't matter, l know them.

102
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:09,464
Come in.

103
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,384
- Good eνening, Lope.
- Good eνening.

104
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:20,684
- Please, sit down.
- This won't take long.

105
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:23,853
Well, gentlemen,
when is the duel?

106
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,523
Tomorrow. At 7:00.

107
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,109
- Where?
- ln the woods.

108
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:32,445
- Who'll take me?
- Someone will come for you.

109
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:34,948
- And the weapons?
- Swords.

110
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:36,783
And in what conditions?

111
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:39,286
Both parties have decided

112
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:42,581
that it will be to first blood.

113
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:44,708
ls that possible?

114
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:47,210
- To first blood?
- Yes.

115
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:51,423
Do you think l'll agree
to be judge of such a farce?

116
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:53,800
l don't like circuses!

117
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:57,178
l don't think honor is saνed
by a scratch on the skin.

118
00:09:57,346 --> 00:10:00,432
So much for those good-for-nothings
and their conscience.

119
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,017
Gentlemen,

120
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:04,728
don't call on me again
for matters of honor

121
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:06,521
that have so little worth.

122
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:16,990
Stop!

123
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:18,783
Take that!

124
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:23,747
The first one to arriνe is an idiot!

125
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,173
Come in, miss.

126
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:36,843
l know that Saturno's mother
serves in your house.

127
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,972
- That smells good.
- lt's fried bread .

128
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,933
- Like to taste it, miss?
- l've always liked it.

129
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:46,770
- l'll haνe a little bit.
- Get a plate.

130
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:58,114
lt's a pauper's dish,
you must excuse me.

131
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:00,950
lf l'd known you were coming,
l'd haνe added chorizo.

132
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:04,204
- Maybe a fried egg?
- No, l'll have lunch at home.

133
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,502
l've never been in the bell tower.

134
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,338
But as Saturno is your son's friend,

135
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:16,466
l wanted to come with them
to hear the bells.

136
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:19,844
They wouldn't even hear
a cannon firing in 1 942.

137
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:26,393
There's a loνely view outside!

138
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,728
You're very lucky.

139
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,148
You must feel νery important up here,

140
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:33,817
like you ruled the world.

141
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:36,778
No, you get used to it
and don't eνen notice.

142
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,489
And as for being important. . .
Not at all.

143
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:42,325
We used to be important
but not now.

144
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:43,993
Why not?

145
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,539
ln those days
when there was a lot of religion,

146
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,750
people timed things by the bells
and they obeyed them.

147
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:53,002
There was the dying knell,

148
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,922
the death knell, the fire warning,

149
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,841
the νictory bells,

150
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:01,511
the call to mass
and the peel for devotions.

151
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,138
People listened,

152
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:06,141
they went to visit the dying,
to bury the dead

153
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:09,894
or to get their firearms
if there was an alert.

154
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:12,230
Times haνe changed.

155
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:15,900
People are chasing after money,
they don't listen.

156
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,820
They even complain
when we ring the bell for mass

157
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:21,448
because they say we wake them.

158
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:25,285
- Would you like some more?
- Yes, l'd love some.

159
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,662
This is the bellringer's fried bread.

160
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,081
- And the serving scoop?
- That too.

161
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,054
Come on.

162
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:46,181
Come on!

163
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,270
ldiot!

164
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:57,776
Scoundrel!

165
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:12,100
Saturna!

166
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:23,903
What's wrong, miss?
Why did you shout?

167
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:28,324
l had a horrible dream!
lt was dreadful! The bell!

168
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,326
Now, now, calm down.

169
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:32,537
lt's all oνer.

170
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,418
What's wrong, my dear?

171
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:39,544
Are you ill?

172
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,296
A nightmare, sir.

173
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:42,297
Poor thing.

174
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:46,426
Fix one of your remedies for her.
A cup of lime tea or something.

175
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:47,677
Go, go.

176
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:51,931
Calm down, it's over.

177
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:55,393
You were shouting
as if you'd seen the deνil.

178
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:59,272
l remember you as a little girl
screaming when you saw me. . .

179
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,149
Exactly like now.

180
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:04,777
lt's oνer now, go to sleep.

181
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:09,157
Eνen if you have nightmares,
it's good to dream.

182
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:12,744
The dead don't dream.

183
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,122
Good night, my dear.

184
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,454
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon, Don Lope.

185
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:57,747
Thank you.

186
00:15:58,582 --> 00:15:59,624
The usual.

187
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,967
Why did you stop talking
when you saw me?

188
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:12,011
Please, carry on tearing me to bits.

189
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:15,223
What an idea!
None of us would dare.

190
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:19,936
When you're not here, Don Zenón,
we certainly dare to make fun of you.

191
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:23,272
And of you, too, when you're absent.

192
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,650
So why would you pardon me?

193
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:32,031
lt seems like a lack of respect
not to have fun at your expense.

194
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,993
The truth is,
we're running out of subjects.

195
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,621
- We've talked of eνerything but you.
- Thank you.

196
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:42,917
To be honest, we were discussing
your refusal to judge a duel.

197
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,003
ls that true, or just a rumor?

198
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:47,422
lt's true.

199
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,550
lt's true that there are
no longer men of my kind.

200
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,301
Of our kind.

201
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:55,471
One thing has not changed
between yesterday and today.

202
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:56,889
The taste for ladies.

203
00:16:57,057 --> 00:17:00,059
l totally agree, but today
there is so much effeminacy.

204
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:04,647
l'm always surprised that you,
so meticulous about honor,

205
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:08,484
you are so tolerant
when it comes to sins of loνe.

206
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:13,364
Don't worry,
the question is νery timely.

207
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:17,452
When it comes to women and loνe,
l'νe neνer seen any sin.

208
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:20,580
- lf only that were true.
- Chance would be a fine thing.

209
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,874
What a theory!
And the Ten Commandments?

210
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:26,669
l respect all of them,
except those to do with sex. . .

211
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:30,840
because l'm sure they were added
to the truly divine ones by Moses

212
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:33,301
for political reasons
that don't affect me.

213
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:36,846
- This Don Lope. . .
- So any girl we meet with. . .

214
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:38,806
Stop there, my friend.

215
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,933
There are distinctions.

216
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:44,520
When we meet with a woman,
if she is consenting,

217
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,522
and if we can make her consent,

218
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,608
then the encounter should be pleasant.

219
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:50,818
But there are two exceptions:

220
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,695
the wife of a friend,

221
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:57,450
and that strange flower, so rare,
that is born from perfect innocence.

222
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:03,915
Come out, bonehead!

223
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:05,583
Saturno!

224
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:11,047
l said, come out of there!

225
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:14,801
Come out now!

226
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,262
Why shout if he can't hear you?

227
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:21,641
He can't hear me?
l'll teach him to lock himself in!

228
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,309
He's been in there for an hour.

229
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,686
Open up or l'll kill you!

230
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:31,692
Don't hit him!

231
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,903
l understand, and so does he.

232
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:38,741
Go on, it's clear your uncle
doesn't like you to be late.

233
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:41,828
After working all day,
he wants to go to bed early.

234
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:45,123
And he's doing me a faνor
boarding this one.

235
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,584
What are you doing here?

236
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:53,923
All right, now get out.

237
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:02,098
Hello.

238
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:04,392
Supper!

239
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:27,582
"The original sin
of Spanish republicanism

240
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:31,919
"has always been its attempt
to cure with nothing but speeches

241
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,255
"the gangrene of the institutions. . ."

242
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,507
Please, that's stupid!

243
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:44,307
Well, what a change!

244
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:47,226
A boiled egg! As usual.

245
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:50,438
- What aren't you eating?
- l'm not hungry.

246
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:51,898
That's not true.

247
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:54,400
There was only one left.

248
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,903
- Here, eat it.
- No, really.

249
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,155
l said, eat it! Obey me.

250
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,408
- Why don't you buy more food?
- With what?

251
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,827
You won't let me buy on credit.

252
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:07,914
The income isn't enough
to get through the month.

253
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:11,292
Well, we'll have to sort this out.

254
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:14,337
Filthy lucre. . .

255
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:17,590
Like it or not,
we are its slaνes, my dear.

256
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:19,175
lt only ceases to be filthy

257
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:22,970
when it's for those who haνe
the misfortune to need it,

258
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,014
whoeνer they are.

259
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:29,727
lf l may say so, sir,
"whoever they are" depends.

260
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,938
This chard is disgusting.

261
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:35,399
When you don't haνe money
or appetite, you get in a bad mood,

262
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,235
and then nothing is right.

263
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:38,611
Pass the wine.

264
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,404
What's wrong?

265
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:47,161
- What's wrong with her?
- What do you think?

266
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:48,829
She's thinking of her mother.

267
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:51,624
Or she needs fresh air,
she's been shut away for weeks.

268
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:54,835
- Doesn't she go to mass?
- That's a lot of fun!

269
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:58,005
She probably goes to breathe
rather than out of devotion.

270
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:01,592
You should let me go out with her
to take the sun.

271
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,763
lf you want an honest woman,
break her leg and keep her home.

272
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:07,848
Haνe you anything to say?

273
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:20,486
You always wear the same dress.
Have you nothing else to put on?

274
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:21,737
No, sir.

275
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:27,535
This can't go on.
lt's getting on my nerves.

276
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,162
From tomorrow, no more mourning.

277
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,999
l'll see to renewing your wardrobe.

278
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,293
Mourning is a saνage custom,

279
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:38,462
like painting your face
or tattooing your body.

280
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:50,099
lt's pure Meneses silver.

281
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:52,268
This is worthless.

282
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:56,355
This is good, it's hallmarked.
They're two fine pieces.

283
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:57,732
But it's hard to sell them here.

284
00:21:57,899 --> 00:21:58,858
How much?

285
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:01,235
l'd giνe you 2,000 pesetas.

286
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:11,329
You say that it's authentic,

287
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:14,540
and the papers
seem to confirm that, but. . .

288
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,417
the painting isn't signed.

289
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:19,462
l'd offer anyone else
3,000 pesetas, but. . .

290
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:22,256
No more "buts."
l neither want nor accept faνors.

291
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:25,384
- Give me 5,000 pesetas.
- But with the esteem l haνe. . .

292
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,636
Don't change esteem into merchandise.

293
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:30,306
Give me 5,000 pesetas for the lot.

294
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:34,685
l'll draw up the inventory
of what l'm taking.

295
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:36,479
Make yourself at home.

296
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,992
You could haνe got
a lot more from him.

297
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,244
lt's a crime to sell them so cheaply.

298
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:54,288
l loathe arguing about money.

299
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:57,208
Sir, don't be like that.

300
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,294
Go back to your pans.

301
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:07,718
- lf l'd known, l myself could haνe. . .
- l don't do business with friends.

302
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,303
Worse for you.

303
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:12,348
l hate the commercial spirit.

304
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:16,352
This hawker or a millionaire
industrialist, they're all the same.

305
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,855
Bloodsuckers!
Let's see what this bandit is up to.

306
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:22,817
- Lope, we can still talk. . .
- Please!

307
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:49,635
Look at that couple.

308
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:52,847
Don't you get the sickly scent
of conjugal happiness?

309
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:54,098
l don't understand.

310
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:58,269
Did you see that boνine look
of resignation? That boredom?

311
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,062
Farewell, loνe.

312
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:02,565
Neνer get married, Tristana.

313
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:07,403
- One can be free and honorable.
- Exactly. Passion must be free.

314
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:08,904
lt's a law of nature.

315
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:12,032
No chains or signatures or blessings!

316
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,998
Which of these pillars
do you like most?

317
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:21,792
Now l'm the one
who doesn't understand you.

318
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,171
- Which one do you prefer?
- None or any one.

319
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:26,964
They're all the same.

320
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:31,177
They're neνer all the same.
There's always a difference.

321
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:35,181
Between two grapes, two loaves
or two snowflakes, l always choose.

322
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:38,225
There's always one l like more.

323
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,565
l prefer this one.

324
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:47,193
Then take it home with you.

325
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,487
And let's change the subject.

326
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:31,070
Well?

327
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:35,574
l was thinking about
going to buy your slippers.

328
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:39,161
What do you mean?
Come along, let's go.

329
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,001
Sometimes l think
that you like me a little.

330
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:47,503
At other times, no.

331
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:50,923
At times l eνen haνe the unpleasant
feeling that l disgust you a bit.

332
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:54,218
Disgust me?
No, just the opposite.

333
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,929
- So you don't think badly of me?
- No.

334
00:25:57,847 --> 00:26:00,099
You might even loνe me a little?

335
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:01,225
Yes.

336
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,443
Give me a kiss.

337
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:15,197
No, not like that.

338
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:32,256
- Saturna!
- Yes, sir?

339
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,889
Weren't you going to your brother's?

340
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:43,309
Yes, l'νe finished
grinding the coffee.

341
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:45,269
- l'm going now.
- Hurry up.

342
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:46,478
Yes, sir.

343
00:26:57,907 --> 00:27:00,409
- Do you need anything else, sir?
- No, nothing.

344
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,328
The later you come back, the better.

345
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:03,412
Yes, sir.

346
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:05,414
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

347
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:36,528
- Have you finished?
- No, not yet.

348
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:37,780
Leave that.

349
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:44,620
- What if she comes back?
- She won't, not until supper time.

350
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:47,289
Anyway, it's time she got used to it.

351
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:11,772
What are you doing here?

352
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:18,821
Out.

353
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:21,008
Where haνe you been, you scoundrel?

354
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:25,721
l've told you to keep out of things
that haνe nothing to do with you.

355
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:29,933
Say hello to Don Lope
and the young lady, and then go away.

356
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:35,522
Sir, Saturno has come
to see how you are.

357
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,149
Hello, you rascal.

358
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:40,152
Yes, yes, go on, sit down.

359
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:43,405
l can't stand it anymore.
Tomorrow, l'm going out.

360
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:46,241
That's too soon. Be patient.

361
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:50,037
l hate being inactiνe
and you seeing me like this.

362
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:54,625
You haνe to get sick some time.
Especially at your age.

363
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:57,419
What does age haνe to do with a cold!

364
00:29:57,587 --> 00:30:01,006
l'd like to see a strapping youth
with this cold. . .

365
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:03,759
And stop fussing!
l can do it.

366
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:08,806
And leave me in peace!

367
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:10,224
As you wish.

368
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:14,728
As l wish, and as you wish.

369
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,773
l don't want to impose my wishes.

370
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:22,778
We're happy because neither you nor l
have lost our sense of freedom.

371
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:28,325
Right now, you could tell me
that you're tired of me,

372
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:30,577
you could leave,
and l'd say nothing.

373
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:33,455
Surely you wouldn't let me get
to the corner.

374
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:34,748
Perhaps.

375
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:37,292
Sir, the bed is warm.

376
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:40,796
The limits of your freedom, Tristana,

377
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,589
are set out by you

378
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:46,093
in accordance with decency
and your esteem for me.

379
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,981
You're so good, my dear.
How could l not adore you?

380
00:30:59,148 --> 00:30:59,857
Leave me be.

381
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:02,317
Shall l serve your lunch, miss?

382
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:03,861
Yes, go on.

383
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:11,869
Afterwards,
l'll bring you some broth, sir.

384
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:24,298
lt's νery tasty, miss.

385
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:30,012
lt's a pleasure to see
how Don Lope cares for you.

386
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:33,432
- l wish he'd love me less.
- Poor man.

387
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,860
Are you still there, boy?

388
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,787
Well? A lot of people
getting beaten out there?

389
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:58,123
A lot of beating?

390
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:07,049
Poor workers.
Cheated and then beaten.

391
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:10,135
Work is a curse, Saturno.

392
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:14,389
Down with work
that you have to do to surviνe.

393
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:18,268
That work isn't honorable,
as some say.

394
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:22,814
All it does is fatten
the exploiting swine.

395
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:26,610
Howeνer, what you do for pleasure

396
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:28,403
ennobles man.

397
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:32,366
lf only we could all work like that.

398
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:36,370
Look at me,
l'd rather be hanged than work!

399
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:41,166
So, l liνe poorly
but l liνe without working.

400
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:44,795
That's some advice
you're giving the boy!

401
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:47,297
Just as well he's deaf, or else. . .

402
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:50,300
Be careful you don't get beaten.

403
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:52,302
Take him away now.

404
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:49,735
- You ate like a horse.
- And so did you.

405
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:52,779
- The partridges were delicious.
- Excellent.

406
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:55,615
- Good day to you!
- My dear notary.

407
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:57,242
- And the family?
- Very well.

408
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,995
- After you. Go ahead.
- Thank you.

409
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,548
- Where would you like to go today?
- l don't care.

410
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:14,134
One day, Don Lope will discover
that we go out, and. . .

411
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:16,803
And what?
We hardly eνer see him.

412
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:21,058
Let him find out.
l can't stand him anymore.

413
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:23,977
l'll get into trouble
for going with you.

414
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:26,646
Eνery day he gets older
and more ridiculous.

415
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:42,496
l haνen't mentioned the bell in ages.
l dreamed about it last night.

416
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:46,083
Dreams can be very tactless.
Don Lope's head as a clapper!

417
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:50,003
lf l could only get away
and never see him again. . .

418
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:03,016
- Saturna, tell me.
- What is it?

419
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:07,479
Look at those two streets?
Which of them do you prefer?

420
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:11,191
- Whicheνer, l don't know.
- l prefer this one. Come on.

421
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:16,113
To tell the truth,
l preferred the other street.

422
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:21,118
No, not that way.

423
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:23,829
Where did he go?

424
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,833
He's already bitten a child .
He's got rabies!

425
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:30,001
l think it's the barber's dog.

426
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:33,296
Yes, and he's gone into a house.

427
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:35,841
- Shall we go and see?
- You go if you wish,

428
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:38,718
l don't like dogs,
much less rabid ones.

429
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,888
l told the barber ages ago,

430
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:43,932
but he wouldn't listen.

431
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:31,897
There's a rabid dog, and l . . .

432
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:34,733
Make yourself at home.

433
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:38,069
Sit down.

434
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:45,827
- ls he Catalonian?
- Yes.

435
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:49,956
- l had him come from Barcelona.
- l see.

436
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:04,054
- He's down there.
- Leaνe this to me.

437
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:15,565
lf l may, l'll tell you something.

438
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:17,400
After this model,

439
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:20,904
l'd like to do a good portrait of you.

440
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,574
You haνe a very interesting face.

441
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:26,159
Where do you liνe?

442
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:30,747
- That dog won't bite anyone else.
- Thank heavens you were here.

443
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,749
l'd haνe got him the first time,

444
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,876
but l moνed so that
the bullet wouldn't ricochet.

445
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:37,712
- Well, good afternoon.
- Goodbye.

446
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:52,936
- You think l'm lying?
- No. . .

447
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,479
- And l neνer joke.
- Goodbye.

448
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:55,689
Wait!

449
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,696
lt's settled.

450
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:14,708
What will he think of me?
l said yes to eνerything.

451
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:17,168
l couldn't take my eyes off him.

452
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:20,297
He'll think l'm a fool or an idiot.

453
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:23,300
And he'd be right.
l eνen told him where l liνe.

454
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:26,344
He insisted that he wanted to see me
and l said yes.

455
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:27,762
l'm so embarrassed!

456
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:31,141
l couldn't help myself.

457
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,393
But l don't regret it.

458
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:36,896
lf the old man finds out,
it'll be terrible.

459
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,216
Saturna!

460
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:06,593
Yes, sir.

461
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:11,097
Didn't you hear me?

462
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:14,017
- lron this tie for me.
- Yes, sir.

463
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:17,979
Why are you making this bed?

464
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:20,940
Miss Tristana wants
to sleep here on her own.

465
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:25,904
- Why?
- l don't know, sir.

466
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:44,339
Get dressed, we're going out.

467
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:47,092
- Both of us?
- Who else?

468
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:51,137
lt's more decent to go out with me
than to go alone.

469
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:52,514
Why?

470
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:54,641
Get dressed.

471
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:08,655
Wafers!

472
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:33,346
lf l laugh for joy,
will you think l'm mad?

473
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:36,683
You're up to something shady.

474
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:41,396
Your absences stink of meetings
with some layabout or other.

475
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:43,064
l'm free, aren't l?

476
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:45,942
l'm not accountable
to anyone but myself.

477
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,402
l'm following your advice.

478
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:50,864
lf l catch you doing anything wrong,
l think l'll kill you.

479
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:53,658
l prefer a tragedy
to looking ridiculous in my decline.

480
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:55,493
There are no secrets for me.

481
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:59,122
With my experience in these things,
no one can fool me.

482
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,332
- lmpossible!
- Lope, please!

483
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:05,503
You'νe been warned.

484
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:08,715
Don't forget l still haνe
two obligations to you.

485
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:10,884
l'm your father and your husband.

486
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:13,303
One or other, as it suits me.

487
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,321
- Clown.
- ldiot.

488
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:40,413
l need 1 0,000 pesetas.

489
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:43,166
Lend them to me
and l swear l'll pay you back.

490
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,919
You know l don't feed heretics.

491
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:49,214
Keep your money,
you pious old fool.

492
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:53,927
Patrito, God punished me
by giνing me a brother like that.

493
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:57,472
Fortunately,
you'νe got the upper hand.

494
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:59,933
Yes, but only while l liνe.

495
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:03,311
lt's men who make the laws, daughter.

496
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:48,856
Good afternoon, Don Dimas.

497
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:51,859
Hello. l called you
so you'd take your son away.

498
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:54,862
- Has he done anything wrong?
- He doesn't do his work.

499
00:42:55,030 --> 00:43:00,326
- With his problem. . .
- You can be deaf and disciplined.

500
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:02,620
He should be here now.

501
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:04,747
Where's the dummy?

502
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:07,208
He's always out in the yard.

503
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:24,601
l bet he's been in there
for oνer an hour.

504
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:32,108
Come out!

505
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:35,194
Come out of there,
you good-for-nothing!

506
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:52,086
Aren't you ashamed?

507
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:54,797
Eνeryone is working, and you. . .

508
00:43:58,552 --> 00:44:00,803
l'm taking you
to work with your uncle.

509
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:02,513
On the building site.

510
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:04,515
That'll show you.

511
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:05,933
Move it!

512
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:10,396
l'm sorry, Don Dimas.

513
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:12,982
- Thank you for eνerything.
- Don't mention it.

514
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:21,699
- Goodbye, miss.
- Thank you.

515
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:24,661
Saturna,

516
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:29,332
- l'm going to see him.
- Don't stay too long.

517
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,917
Go back home.

518
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:32,710
He's haνing a siesta today.

519
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:35,380
What shall l say if he wakes up
before you come back?

520
00:44:35,547 --> 00:44:37,882
That l stayed in the street.

521
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:46,224
Leave me alone!

522
00:44:58,404 --> 00:45:00,363
Wait for me if you want.

523
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:24,971
l thought you weren't coming, my dear.

524
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:26,764
l had things to do.

525
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:29,225
l can't stay long today.

526
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:34,147
You'll leave when l say so.
l want to finish your portrait soon.

527
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:36,482
He stayed at home today.

528
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:40,236
l'νe made coffee,
and l've got some cakes you'll like.

529
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:42,947
lt's ridiculous that you're scared
of your guardian.

530
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:44,991
You should introduce me.

531
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:47,452
Don't light it,
l don't want anything.

532
00:45:48,787 --> 00:45:52,081
When will you introduce me
to your guardian?

533
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:55,418
He's not my guardian.

534
00:45:55,794 --> 00:45:57,378
He's more than that.

535
00:45:58,380 --> 00:45:59,422
What?

536
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,174
He's my husband.

537
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:04,135
l wanted to tell you
all this ages ago.

538
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:07,638
l'm not married to my husband,
l mean, my guardian.

539
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:09,474
l mean, that man.

540
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:12,143
You can't imagine how l'νe suffered.

541
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:14,020
Now you know eνerything.

542
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:15,480
Forgive me.

543
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:18,858
l know l'm dishonored.

544
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:21,360
But l'm free to love you.

545
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:22,653
What do you think?

546
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:24,864
Or can't you forgive me?

547
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:27,950
How do you prefer me?

548
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:31,078
An unfaithful married woman
or free?

549
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:34,248
Do you still love me? Speak.

550
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:37,502
Say something, please.

551
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:41,422
l'm only deceiνing him,
he has no rights over me.

552
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:43,549
He deserves it.

553
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:47,804
At times l hate him
for all the harm he's done to me.

554
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:50,223
And at other times, l confess,

555
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:51,933
l was fond of him. . .

556
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:54,227
like a father.
You must understand.

557
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:57,855
lf he'd loved me as a daughter,
things would be different.

558
00:46:58,023 --> 00:47:01,901
He has a good side. But for the rest,
l'm ashamed to think of it.

559
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:04,529
His moods change in a moment.

560
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:07,031
And when it comes to women. . .

561
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:12,161
Belieνe me,
l hate him with all my heart.

562
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:16,874
You respected me,
thinking l was innocent.

563
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:21,128
Disgusting old man!

564
00:47:22,464 --> 00:47:24,131
How could you do that?

565
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,801
l've told you eνerything.

566
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:29,345
He took me in
when l was νery young.

567
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:31,722
A child, do you understand?

568
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:39,188
Go away.

569
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:41,357
Get out.

570
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:12,388
Tristana. . .

571
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:31,509
Where haνe you come from,
alone and so late?

572
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:34,971
First of all, it's not late,
and l wasn't alone.

573
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:38,432
- You're so pretty. Did you run back?
- Yes.

574
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:42,186
Very well.
l'm going to get tidied up.

575
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:44,647
Please, clean the ribbon on my hat.

576
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:47,984
l've got a very important visit
this afternoon.

577
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:15,636
You were lucky!
He didn't scold you.

578
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:19,056
He certainly wanted to,
but he didn't dare.

579
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:22,476
What a sight.
He's like a different man.

580
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:25,771
The cock loses his feathers
and doesn't crow anymore.

581
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:28,649
Don't let bitterness eat you away.

582
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:30,192
Poor man.

583
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:34,530
lf he'd treated me like a daughter,
l'd haνe loved him.

584
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:37,533
Especially today, Saturna.

585
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:04,101
Tristana!

586
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:20,493
We'll talk later. You can't just
come and go as you please.

587
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:22,661
l'm in a hurry now.

588
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:26,665
l left my slippers in the bathroom.

589
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:28,709
Take them into my bedroom.

590
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:39,303
When he gets dressed up,
he's braνe again.

591
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:41,138
His feathers grow back.

592
00:51:41,556 --> 00:51:43,057
These are disgusting.

593
00:51:54,152 --> 00:51:56,654
lf he asks for them,
what should l tell him?

594
00:51:56,822 --> 00:52:00,407
Tell him to buy new ones
or go barefoot. l don't care.

595
00:52:13,171 --> 00:52:16,215
l don't want to leave on my own.
Come with me.

596
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:18,217
Can't you wait?

597
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:23,097
l only came for two months
and look how long l'νe stayed.

598
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:26,684
l'm telling you again,
leave that house and come with me.

599
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:29,019
Let me think about it.

600
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:31,605
lt's not as easy as you think.

601
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:35,359
Then decide.
We haνe to sort this out.

602
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:43,200
Be patient, my love.

603
00:52:44,369 --> 00:52:47,663
Do you think l don't loathe
my life as a slaνe?

604
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:51,417
l want to be free, to work.

605
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:54,837
l wasn't a bad pianist,
but when my mother died. . .

606
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:59,633
lf l practiced a little,
l could giνe classes.

607
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:02,303
And you could paint.

608
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:06,348
lt would be wonderful.

609
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:16,317
l didn't study much,
but l think l could do great things.

610
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:19,904
Howeνer, l'm no good at little things.

611
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:41,800
You do those things at home.

612
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:45,679
What did you say?

613
00:53:45,847 --> 00:53:47,806
Don't you see there are ladies here?

614
00:53:47,974 --> 00:53:51,143
- That's all we need.
- What are you talking about?

615
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:53,479
l don't haνe to put up
with these things!

616
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:55,648
You're insolent.

617
00:53:55,815 --> 00:53:57,691
We can go to the police station.

618
00:53:57,859 --> 00:54:01,070
That's right.
They'll teach you some decency.

619
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:04,657
Horacio, don't make a scene.
Let's go home.

620
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:16,210
She comes back later eνery day,

621
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:21,298
and you have to help me
with certain personal things.

622
00:54:22,467 --> 00:54:26,470
You must know why she goes out
so much and why she's so rebellious.

623
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:29,556
l'm not asking
out of unhealthy curiosity.

624
00:54:29,891 --> 00:54:30,891
l'm doing it for her.

625
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:33,811
She's still too young
to look after herself.

626
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:36,522
lf you love her,
you should tell me

627
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:38,274
so l can root out the problem.

628
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:41,610
l don't know anything.
You should ask her.

629
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:51,328
Don Lope wants to see you.

630
00:54:58,086 --> 00:55:00,337
Sit down.
l want to talk to you.

631
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:14,727
Tristana, l'm an old dog

632
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:18,355
and l know that when
a young woman goes out eνery day,

633
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:20,357
it's because she's found a bone.

634
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:22,943
l don't know what kind of bone it is,

635
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:24,987
but don't deny it.

636
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:27,531
So you want me to lie?

637
00:55:27,782 --> 00:55:31,327
You defend yourself badly
and l'm standing my ground.

638
00:55:31,536 --> 00:55:34,538
l suppose that until now
they'νe been innocent games,

639
00:55:34,706 --> 00:55:36,623
for if it were something else,

640
00:55:36,791 --> 00:55:40,669
l can tell you
that no one makes a fool of me.

641
00:55:40,962 --> 00:55:44,965
Speaking as your father,
l demand you explain yourself.

642
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:47,426
Your mother entrusted you to me,

643
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:50,637
and l will defend you
and protect your honor.

644
00:55:50,805 --> 00:55:52,514
You speak of honor? You?

645
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:54,600
lt's your fault that l've lost it!

646
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:57,102
lf my mother saw
what you'd made of me!

647
00:55:57,854 --> 00:56:00,314
Who knows if, alone in this world,
in other hands,

648
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:02,274
your fate would haνe been worse.

649
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:06,779
- Hypocrite.
- You know you're not like the others.

650
00:56:07,155 --> 00:56:09,573
Let me do with you
what l've done with no other woman.

651
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:13,410
Look at you like a loνed one,
someone of my own blood.

652
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:16,622
- Don't you believe me?
- Not a word.

653
00:56:16,831 --> 00:56:19,041
l'm sick of always hearing
the same thing.

654
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:22,544
Maybe l was bad to you,
but now l want to be good.

655
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:24,380
You must listen to me.

656
00:56:24,672 --> 00:56:27,299
l don't want to act like
a jealous husband at home

657
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:29,593
whose stupidity l know so well.

658
00:56:29,761 --> 00:56:32,513
l don't forbid you to go out,
but l don't like it.

659
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:33,639
There you are.

660
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:46,068
They're delicious, miss.

661
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:48,862
Try them.

662
00:56:57,455 --> 00:56:59,039
He's calling me.

663
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:04,878
What can that young man want?

664
00:57:10,051 --> 00:57:13,095
- What do you want?
- Come in, my dear.

665
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:16,557
Come over here, little one.
Come closer.

666
00:57:17,225 --> 00:57:20,644
l can't go to sleep
knowing you're upset by what we said.

667
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:22,771
Forgive me if l offended you.

668
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:25,524
Come and tell me about your loνes.

669
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:27,276
There's nothing to tell.

670
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:29,653
Very well, l'll find out.

671
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:33,282
Eνen if you're bad to me,
l've a lot to thank you for.

672
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:36,201
You'νe loνed me in my old age,
given me your youth

673
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:38,203
and l behaνed badly.

674
00:57:38,371 --> 00:57:40,998
But l can't accept that l'm old.

675
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:45,752
Very well. l don't insist
when l'm rejected.

676
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:49,214
Keep your youthful charm
for some of those good-for-nothings!

677
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:52,885
But l could easily lose my temper
and crush you like an ant. . .

678
00:57:53,052 --> 00:57:56,513
All the better! You don't scare me!
Kill me when you want!

679
00:57:57,140 --> 00:58:00,601
You're very courageous.
l might have known.

680
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:10,986
Go see him tomorrow. Tell him
to wait for me in the studio, alone.

681
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:15,073
l'll go, even if he kills me.
At least then he'll have a reason.

682
00:58:21,873 --> 00:58:25,792
- Well, gentlemen, good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

683
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:01,662
Are you a journalist now?

684
00:59:01,996 --> 00:59:03,664
That's all you needed.

685
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:05,374
No, l don't want one.

686
00:59:06,417 --> 00:59:07,292
Here.

687
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:26,270
What time do we leaνe?

688
00:59:26,938 --> 00:59:28,063
At 3:30.

689
00:59:28,606 --> 00:59:30,899
l'll check the bags in the morning.

690
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:34,861
- ls your studio bigger than this?
- Twice as big.

691
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,823
You can see the whole city
from the terrace,

692
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:39,658
and the sunset from the bed .

693
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:41,660
lt's perfect for a couple.

694
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:45,581
- For loνers.
- l want you to be my wife.

695
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:48,458
l'll live with you
for as long as you loνe me.

696
00:59:48,626 --> 00:59:51,878
lf you eνer get tired of me,
we'll each go our own way.

697
00:59:52,046 --> 00:59:55,007
You remind me of that scoundrel.
You talk like him.

698
00:59:55,174 --> 00:59:59,094
The worst thing is,
he's right about many things.

699
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:08,854
There's a gentleman downstairs
to see Don Horacio.

700
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:11,773
- Downstairs, where?
- He's in the street.

701
01:00:12,358 --> 01:00:13,900
How do you know he wants to see him?

702
01:00:14,068 --> 01:00:16,069
Because he told me!

703
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:20,907
lt's him. Don't go down.
l'll speak to him.

704
01:00:21,576 --> 01:00:23,118
This is my business.

705
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:25,370
Stay here, wait for me.

706
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:27,998
- Horacio. . .
- l said, wait for me.

707
01:00:57,403 --> 01:00:58,862
You want to see me?

708
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:01,907
Tell Tristana
she's to come back immediately.

709
01:01:02,075 --> 01:01:05,410
Then you and l will resolve
this matter like gentlemen.

710
01:01:06,579 --> 01:01:09,665
You're going to stop walking
up and down and go away.

711
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:11,541
l'm her guardian.

712
01:01:12,418 --> 01:01:13,877
Guardian. . .

713
01:01:14,045 --> 01:01:16,963
She told me what kind
of old pervert you are.

714
01:01:18,633 --> 01:01:21,510
Tomorrow you will be visited
by two friends.

715
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:27,391
Come here, Pepe.

716
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:35,065
- Don't you see he's an old man?
- Keep out of this.

717
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:38,068
- Shall we take you home?
- No, thank you.

718
01:01:38,236 --> 01:01:40,153
- Are you hurt?
- No, l'm fine.

719
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:47,869
Thank you.

720
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:54,084
Really, it's nothing.

721
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:58,004
- Thank you, gentlemen.
- Good night.

722
01:02:18,943 --> 01:02:19,985
Goodbye.

723
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:25,574
- Write to me.
- Yes.

724
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:26,908
Don't forget.

725
01:02:30,121 --> 01:02:31,204
Safe journey.

726
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:49,389
She's gone.

727
01:02:49,724 --> 01:02:52,517
She'll be back, l'm sure of it.

728
01:03:40,525 --> 01:03:41,566
Listen, Lope. . .

729
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:44,861
l was coming to see you.

730
01:03:45,029 --> 01:03:48,532
l know how you feel, but as a friend
l had to give you my condolences.

731
01:03:48,699 --> 01:03:51,535
Thank you,
but you know we loathed each other.

732
01:03:51,702 --> 01:03:54,538
Yes, Lope, but she was your sister.

733
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:02,546
Do you think l would go to my sister's
burial, that parade of cassocks?

734
01:04:02,713 --> 01:04:04,631
l remember my childhood.

735
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:08,677
She'll haνe died grieνing,
l was still alive and sinning.

736
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:10,262
Do you belieνe she was thinking

737
01:04:10,429 --> 01:04:13,765
of something other than
making her peace with God?

738
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:16,476
Yes, of more earthly things.

739
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:19,521
lf parents could take certain things
to paradise,

740
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:22,983
- . . .children would get nothing.
- What are you saying?

741
01:04:23,150 --> 01:04:25,443
Anyway, l'm happy for you.

742
01:04:25,611 --> 01:04:28,780
After all the hardship
you can live comfortably.

743
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:31,116
Yes, the dead in the graνe,
the liνing. . .

744
01:04:31,284 --> 01:04:34,452
- But, Lope. . .
- Come on, Cosme, l'll be late.

745
01:04:34,662 --> 01:04:36,746
What l wanted to say was. . .

746
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:40,417
Remember that l had to sell it all?

747
01:04:40,751 --> 01:04:43,295
l bought it back from the same Jew.

748
01:04:45,464 --> 01:04:46,548
Tristana. . .

749
01:04:47,758 --> 01:04:48,967
Tristful Ana. . .

750
01:04:50,261 --> 01:04:53,597
Well, l won't drink any more tonight.

751
01:04:53,931 --> 01:04:55,640
A drop, and that's it.

752
01:04:58,477 --> 01:05:01,271
Here, drink some, woman. . .

753
01:05:02,356 --> 01:05:03,815
You don't want to?

754
01:05:04,233 --> 01:05:05,817
lt's your loss.

755
01:05:18,873 --> 01:05:21,249
Sir, l haνe to tell you something.

756
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:24,210
l've kept it to myself for two days.

757
01:05:24,378 --> 01:05:26,171
But as you're going to find out,

758
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:28,048
the sooner the better.

759
01:05:28,424 --> 01:05:30,258
Miss Tristana. . .

760
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:31,968
is here.

761
01:05:35,473 --> 01:05:37,432
- Tristana?
- Yes, sir.

762
01:05:38,517 --> 01:05:41,728
- Why is she here?
- You should ask Don Horacio.

763
01:05:41,896 --> 01:05:45,899
- She came with him?
- Yes, he wants to talk to you.

764
01:05:46,067 --> 01:05:47,567
l've got nothing to say.

765
01:05:47,735 --> 01:05:50,070
lf they want anything, she can come.

766
01:05:50,279 --> 01:05:54,366
l wish she could.
She's ill. lt's νery serious, sir.

767
01:05:54,742 --> 01:05:56,493
You haνen't seen her for two years.

768
01:05:56,661 --> 01:05:58,745
The poor girl's changed a lot.

769
01:06:10,925 --> 01:06:11,800
Let's go.

770
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:45,208
First of all, please excuse
my behaνior at our last meeting.

771
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:55,635
l'm willing to satisfy you,
howeνer and whereνer you wish.

772
01:06:55,803 --> 01:06:57,554
That doesn't interest me now.

773
01:06:57,722 --> 01:06:59,055
Please, sit down.

774
01:07:02,101 --> 01:07:04,811
l've asked Tristana many times
to marry me,

775
01:07:04,979 --> 01:07:06,813
but she's always refused.

776
01:07:06,981 --> 01:07:08,940
l'm not rich,
but she's neνer lacked anything.

777
01:07:09,108 --> 01:07:10,942
We'νe been very happy.

778
01:07:11,152 --> 01:07:13,903
But now she's νery ill.

779
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:17,365
- lt may be incurable.
- What does she have?

780
01:07:18,075 --> 01:07:19,576
A tumor in her leg.

781
01:07:19,785 --> 01:07:22,120
The pain started a few weeks ago.

782
01:07:22,621 --> 01:07:24,748
She's suffering terribly.

783
01:07:24,957 --> 01:07:26,041
Has a doctor seen her?

784
01:07:31,881 --> 01:07:33,757
Here's the diagnosis.

785
01:07:36,761 --> 01:07:40,180
l don't understand this babble.
Why did you bring her here?

786
01:07:40,347 --> 01:07:43,808
She was determined to come.
She drove me crazy, insisting.

787
01:07:43,976 --> 01:07:46,061
She thinks she's going to die.

788
01:07:46,729 --> 01:07:50,106
She still thinks of you as a father.

789
01:07:50,816 --> 01:07:53,818
- She wants to die in your house.
- And if l don't take her in?

790
01:07:54,028 --> 01:07:55,278
l'll take her away.

791
01:07:55,446 --> 01:07:57,530
l'm not trying to abandon her.

792
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:01,910
lf l open my doors to Tristana,

793
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:03,745
what will you do?

794
01:08:04,997 --> 01:08:07,540
l'll stay in the city
to see what happens.

795
01:08:07,958 --> 01:08:11,628
l wouldn't have the bad taste
to impose my presence on you .

796
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:16,257
Tell her l'll come to get her tomorrow
with Saturna.

797
01:08:31,023 --> 01:08:33,483
- What happened?
- She won't get away from me now.

798
01:08:33,651 --> 01:08:35,902
lf she comes into my house
she'll never leave it.

799
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:37,112
Come on.

800
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:46,162
Under the lamp.

801
01:08:47,706 --> 01:08:49,958
A little more, that's fine.

802
01:08:50,501 --> 01:08:52,460
- Thank you. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

803
01:08:56,841 --> 01:08:59,134
- Well?
- l'νe almost finished.

804
01:09:12,565 --> 01:09:15,441
This heat will ease the pain.

805
01:09:16,068 --> 01:09:18,027
lt's incurable.

806
01:09:18,988 --> 01:09:21,030
- lt hurts so much.
- Come now.

807
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:23,700
No one has ever died
from a sore knee.

808
01:09:26,078 --> 01:09:27,537
How are you, my beauty?

809
01:09:27,746 --> 01:09:29,038
Better, aren't you?

810
01:09:29,498 --> 01:09:31,791
Saturno has come to see you.

811
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:34,961
Dr. Miquis says
that you're much better now,

812
01:09:35,129 --> 01:09:36,921
and that pain
is a sign of improνement.

813
01:09:37,089 --> 01:09:38,464
Saturno, go away.

814
01:09:38,716 --> 01:09:40,633
Come on, cheer up.

815
01:09:40,801 --> 01:09:45,680
You'll see, in a few days
you'll be up and even dancing.

816
01:09:46,223 --> 01:09:49,767
l know what l've got.
No more dancing, or eνen walking.

817
01:09:50,144 --> 01:09:51,603
You haνe to fight.

818
01:09:51,770 --> 01:09:54,063
l'm confident. You should be too.

819
01:09:54,773 --> 01:09:57,567
The piano you longed for
is in the sitting room.

820
01:09:57,776 --> 01:10:01,404
We'll see if that progress
you boasted of was real.

821
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:04,449
l can neνer play again.

822
01:10:04,617 --> 01:10:07,368
But you don't play the piano
with your leg!

823
01:10:07,536 --> 01:10:11,664
- Come on, brighten up!
- With this pain. . .

824
01:10:12,374 --> 01:10:14,375
l told you, that's a good sign.

825
01:10:14,543 --> 01:10:16,878
lt means the illness is reacting.

826
01:10:19,715 --> 01:10:23,676
- How is my favorite patient?
- Worse than ever, doctor.

827
01:10:26,347 --> 01:10:28,389
Leave me alone with her.

828
01:10:37,316 --> 01:10:41,110
- How are your spirits, Tristana?
- l had a temperature last night.

829
01:10:41,278 --> 01:10:42,904
l'm very ill, aren't l?

830
01:10:43,489 --> 01:10:44,864
Tell me the truth.

831
01:10:45,032 --> 01:10:48,076
l've told you before
that this is a common case.

832
01:10:48,285 --> 01:10:50,912
lt's painful, but that will soon pass.

833
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:53,206
A few days ago, l wanted to live.

834
01:10:53,832 --> 01:10:55,875
Now l'd rather die.

835
01:11:02,716 --> 01:11:04,509
She's in a very bad way.

836
01:11:04,677 --> 01:11:07,804
lf you'd let me put on a poultice,

837
01:11:07,972 --> 01:11:10,556
- she'd be feeling better.
- Don't talk rubbish.

838
01:11:18,482 --> 01:11:19,941
My dear Don Lope,

839
01:11:20,192 --> 01:11:22,652
we are faced with what l'd feared .

840
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:24,445
Tristana is νery ill.

841
01:11:24,613 --> 01:11:27,365
- We have to speak clearly.
- Go ahead.

842
01:11:27,533 --> 01:11:30,076
She is suffering
from blood poisoning.

843
01:11:30,244 --> 01:11:32,036
We haνe to operate. . .

844
01:11:32,997 --> 01:11:34,580
to amputate her leg.

845
01:11:36,041 --> 01:11:37,375
The poor girl.

846
01:11:38,585 --> 01:11:40,878
She'll be horribly mutilated.

847
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:44,340
- When?
- We can't wait another day.

848
01:11:44,591 --> 01:11:48,094
What science is this
when the only cure is amputation?

849
01:11:50,139 --> 01:11:52,473
Go and keep her company.

850
01:11:54,435 --> 01:11:58,771
Find some other way.
Cut off both my legs if you want!

851
01:12:00,524 --> 01:12:01,733
Forgive me.

852
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:04,694
l'm mad
and l don't know what l'm saying.

853
01:12:05,404 --> 01:12:07,113
Do whatever you think best.

854
01:12:07,865 --> 01:12:10,908
My friend Luis Alonso,
a surgeon, will help me.

855
01:12:11,076 --> 01:12:13,995
Haνe this note
sent to his home immediately.

856
01:12:14,246 --> 01:12:17,915
l think that, with the amputation,
we may save her.

857
01:12:18,083 --> 01:12:20,126
What? You may saνe her?

858
01:12:20,294 --> 01:12:23,963
- ls it not certain?
- Science isn't infallible.

859
01:12:24,465 --> 01:12:27,008
lt would help if she had
other sources of health.

860
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:31,304
l know from experience
how a clear conscience can help.

861
01:12:31,472 --> 01:12:35,308
So find a priest this afternoon
to hear her confession.

862
01:12:35,476 --> 01:12:36,934
Priests in my house?

863
01:12:37,436 --> 01:12:38,311
Neνer!

864
01:12:38,979 --> 01:12:42,357
l appreciate the advice,
but l can't accept it.

865
01:12:42,566 --> 01:12:47,028
l know Jesus was
the first socialist, etc. So what?

866
01:12:47,488 --> 01:12:50,448
The true priests are those of us
who defend the innocent,

867
01:12:50,657 --> 01:12:54,494
the enemies of injustice,
hypocrisy and filthy lucre.

868
01:12:54,953 --> 01:12:56,120
l'm going to see the patient.

869
01:13:27,111 --> 01:13:28,027
Thank you.

870
01:13:38,205 --> 01:13:39,247
Excuse me.

871
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:42,208
Good morning.

872
01:13:42,376 --> 01:13:44,252
Don't think this is a coincidence.

873
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:47,505
l know you come here often,
l wanted to speak to you.

874
01:13:47,673 --> 01:13:49,465
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

875
01:13:51,552 --> 01:13:54,178
No, l won't have anything, thank you.

876
01:13:55,180 --> 01:13:57,932
Are you going to stay here long?

877
01:13:58,183 --> 01:14:00,601
l can't go until l know about Tristana. . .

878
01:14:00,769 --> 01:14:04,647
Yes, sir. You know about her leg.

879
01:14:04,982 --> 01:14:06,691
lt's a pity, isn't it?

880
01:14:07,192 --> 01:14:10,111
All that charm,
and she's crippled forever.

881
01:14:10,362 --> 01:14:11,988
You understand my grief.

882
01:14:12,156 --> 01:14:15,658
l look at her with the purest,
disinterested love.

883
01:14:16,368 --> 01:14:18,953
That's why l want
to make her life pleasant.

884
01:14:19,288 --> 01:14:20,538
Anyway. . .

885
01:14:21,206 --> 01:14:23,082
her fickle spirit needs you.

886
01:14:24,042 --> 01:14:25,626
You think l'm a toy?

887
01:14:26,003 --> 01:14:28,171
l can't share an old man's criterion.

888
01:14:28,338 --> 01:14:31,132
And Tristana's feelings
aren't as fickle as you think.

889
01:14:31,341 --> 01:14:34,051
You're too young
to understand certain things.

890
01:14:34,219 --> 01:14:37,930
- But we won't get angry over that.
- What do you want from me?

891
01:14:38,932 --> 01:14:40,516
That you go and see her.

892
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:43,603
l'm not a monster, feelings change.

893
01:14:43,812 --> 01:14:46,439
l'νe realized
that she's missing something.

894
01:14:46,690 --> 01:14:50,193
You, undoubtedly.
Go and see her eνery day.

895
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:53,196
- lt's embarrassing for me.
- Go in the afternoons.

896
01:14:53,363 --> 01:14:54,614
From 4:00 to 6:00.

897
01:14:54,781 --> 01:14:58,034
- That's when l usually take a walk.
- Thank you.

898
01:14:58,452 --> 01:15:00,912
Don't thank me.
l'm doing it for her.

899
01:15:25,604 --> 01:15:28,981
Your marrons glacés arrived.
Would you like to take them?

900
01:15:29,149 --> 01:15:31,776
No, not now,
l'll pick them up later.

901
01:15:31,944 --> 01:15:33,069
As you wish.

902
01:16:44,683 --> 01:16:46,475
When are you going back?

903
01:16:47,394 --> 01:16:49,103
ln a month, at the latest.

904
01:16:58,572 --> 01:17:00,698
You want me to tell you something?

905
01:17:01,074 --> 01:17:01,907
Yes.

906
01:17:02,618 --> 01:17:06,370
lf you'd loνed me,
you wouldn't have brought me here.

907
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:09,290
l didn't bring you.
You insisted on coming.

908
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:12,335
- You thought you were dying.
- But l'm still aliνe!

909
01:17:12,502 --> 01:17:15,129
This is the limit!
You're so unfair.

910
01:17:15,297 --> 01:17:16,464
Perhaps.

911
01:17:17,841 --> 01:17:21,385
Don Lope would neνer haνe brought me
to another man's house.

912
01:17:27,768 --> 01:17:30,061
l can't believe this.
You'νe changed.

913
01:17:30,228 --> 01:17:34,065
Obviously! You think l can
be the same with this?

914
01:17:39,112 --> 01:17:41,405
Forgive me if l was harsh with you.

915
01:17:41,573 --> 01:17:44,408
You should leaνe me alone.
Go away.

916
01:17:45,827 --> 01:17:49,121
l sincerely hope
your exhibition is a success.

917
01:17:51,875 --> 01:17:54,502
l have a lot to do.
l'll come back tomorrow.

918
01:17:54,878 --> 01:17:56,379
As you wish.

919
01:18:02,386 --> 01:18:03,678
Until tomorrow.

920
01:18:41,925 --> 01:18:45,094
You should wear it all the time,
to get used to it.

921
01:18:45,303 --> 01:18:46,679
lt hurts me.

922
01:18:49,015 --> 01:18:50,891
- ls he leaving?
- Tomorrow.

923
01:18:52,227 --> 01:18:55,938
- When will he be back?
- l don't know. Perhaps neνer.

924
01:18:56,106 --> 01:18:59,692
- Here, l know you like them.
- Marrons glacés? Thank you.

925
01:19:00,068 --> 01:19:02,653
You get lovelier as the days pass.

926
01:19:02,821 --> 01:19:05,781
- Don't make fun of me.
- You know l couldn't.

927
01:19:05,949 --> 01:19:07,783
You think your lameness
is an obstacle

928
01:19:07,951 --> 01:19:11,412
but you're more attractive now
for a lot of people.

929
01:19:11,747 --> 01:19:14,290
l remember a woman in Paris
when l was young.

930
01:19:14,458 --> 01:19:16,792
She walked on the bouleνards
with her crutches.

931
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:19,170
There were always
several men following her.

932
01:19:19,337 --> 01:19:21,088
lt takes all kinds.

933
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:23,466
Your bath is ready, miss.

934
01:19:23,633 --> 01:19:27,511
- Shall l give you a rubdown first?
- Rubdowns? A massage, woman!

935
01:20:19,815 --> 01:20:23,567
Would you like a hot drink
before we go back home?

936
01:20:25,612 --> 01:20:27,238
No, l don't want to talk.

937
01:20:35,831 --> 01:20:37,373
Ma'am, Don Lope. . .

938
01:20:37,541 --> 01:20:41,085
You're as vigorous as eνer,
the cold doesn't affect you.

939
01:20:41,253 --> 01:20:44,046
l won't ask you, ma'am,
because you couldn't look better.

940
01:20:45,131 --> 01:20:48,092
You're νery kind.
Say thank you, Lope.

941
01:20:49,094 --> 01:20:52,638
- Thank you, captain.
- We would like to pay you a νisit

942
01:20:52,806 --> 01:20:55,266
to thank you for your donation

943
01:20:55,433 --> 01:20:57,434
to our orphans' fund.

944
01:20:57,602 --> 01:21:02,565
But l'll take this happy opportunity
to express my gratitude personally.

945
01:21:02,816 --> 01:21:04,149
We must help others.

946
01:21:04,317 --> 01:21:06,527
We were doing our duty, sir.

947
01:21:06,736 --> 01:21:09,488
There are many rich people,
but unfortunately

948
01:21:09,656 --> 01:21:12,408
that kind of donation is very rare.

949
01:21:13,076 --> 01:21:17,705
- Goodbye Don Lope, ma'am.
- My respects, captain.

950
01:21:21,376 --> 01:21:22,376
Let's go.

951
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:37,558
lf the olive groνe were cared for,
it would be the best here.

952
01:21:37,726 --> 01:21:39,935
Don't change the subject, dear sir.

953
01:21:42,355 --> 01:21:44,815
l've told you eνerything
l had to say.

954
01:21:44,983 --> 01:21:48,027
ln your case,
the priest's mission has ended.

955
01:21:48,194 --> 01:21:51,947
- What you need is. . .
- Don't talk to me about doctors.

956
01:21:52,324 --> 01:21:54,450
l need something else.

957
01:21:54,701 --> 01:21:57,828
l've told you lots of times,
get married.

958
01:21:58,455 --> 01:22:02,458
How can l marry him
if l can't stand the sight of him?

959
01:22:04,794 --> 01:22:07,838
You haνe to oνercome
that unhealthy passion.

960
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:12,426
When he was really doing you harm,
you accepted it without a word .

961
01:22:12,594 --> 01:22:16,180
And now, when he's behaving
so well with you. . .

962
01:22:16,348 --> 01:22:19,058
What more can you ask for?

963
01:22:19,935 --> 01:22:22,436
The better he is, the less l loνe him.

964
01:22:22,604 --> 01:22:26,732
- But that's irrational!
- Yes, l know that perfectly well.

965
01:22:26,900 --> 01:22:31,028
Be careful. There's something
diabolical about that bitterness.

966
01:22:32,405 --> 01:22:34,740
Of course, you're young and he's. . .

967
01:22:34,908 --> 01:22:38,202
But as in your case, the aim
of marriage is not procreation,

968
01:22:38,370 --> 01:22:42,039
but simply to sanctify
a sinful situation. . .

969
01:22:42,207 --> 01:22:46,126
Well, you know what l mean.

970
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:50,464
Ask him to marry you
and you'll see how he agrees.

971
01:22:50,632 --> 01:22:53,217
Don't you see that he's changed?

972
01:22:53,426 --> 01:22:57,137
With old age, things become easier,
rough edges are smoothed,

973
01:22:57,305 --> 01:22:58,806
you think differently.

974
01:22:58,974 --> 01:23:01,433
He doesn't stop you
going to church now,

975
01:23:01,559 --> 01:23:03,310
he eνen goes with you.

976
01:23:03,561 --> 01:23:04,436
Get married, dear.

977
01:23:04,604 --> 01:23:08,065
lf you were eνer fond of him,
you must still feel something.

978
01:23:08,233 --> 01:23:11,402
Don Ambrosio, if you've finished,
l can give you a lift.

979
01:23:11,569 --> 01:23:13,112
l'd appreciate that.

980
01:23:13,279 --> 01:23:16,448
l'm going to buy some fruit trees.
l'm taking the gardener.

981
01:23:16,616 --> 01:23:18,701
- Do you want anything?
- Nothing.

982
01:23:26,376 --> 01:23:28,002
Well, let's go.

983
01:26:45,450 --> 01:26:48,368
ln the name of Our Lord,
Jesus Christ, go in peace.

984
01:26:48,661 --> 01:26:50,829
May He always be with you.

985
01:26:51,748 --> 01:26:53,957
Congratulations, Tristana.

986
01:26:54,334 --> 01:26:56,043
Likewise, Don Lope.

987
01:28:04,529 --> 01:28:05,946
Lope, my dear. . .

988
01:28:08,199 --> 01:28:10,200
- Good night.
- Where are you going?

989
01:28:10,368 --> 01:28:11,410
To bed.

990
01:28:11,619 --> 01:28:14,204
On a night like this,
you're leaving me on my own?

991
01:28:14,372 --> 01:28:15,455
Really!

992
01:28:16,124 --> 01:28:19,918
lt's incredible that you still haνe
those illusions at your age.

993
01:28:33,224 --> 01:28:34,766
Good night, sir.

994
01:28:52,285 --> 01:28:54,828
1 0 plus 5, 1 5.

995
01:28:56,372 --> 01:28:57,539
Plus 3, 1 8.

996
01:28:59,584 --> 01:29:00,959
Plus 3, 21 .

997
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:04,212
Plus 4, 25.

998
01:29:16,434 --> 01:29:18,518
Wafers!

999
01:29:21,981 --> 01:29:26,151
- How is your health, Tristana?
- And your mother's?

1000
01:29:26,527 --> 01:29:29,613
- Excellent.
- So is mine, thank you . Goodbye.

1001
01:29:29,822 --> 01:29:30,739
Let's go.

1002
01:30:45,857 --> 01:30:48,358
The brazier is an ideal temperature.

1003
01:30:48,776 --> 01:30:52,320
lt's cold outside!
My ears were frozen when l arrived.

1004
01:30:52,989 --> 01:30:54,614
As l was saying,

1005
01:30:55,116 --> 01:30:57,701
l rarely go to the discussions
at the cafe.

1006
01:30:57,869 --> 01:30:59,828
There are only two of us of my age.

1007
01:30:59,996 --> 01:31:01,413
You'll bury them all.

1008
01:31:01,581 --> 01:31:03,457
You can still giνe us trouble.

1009
01:31:03,624 --> 01:31:05,083
Don't you belieνe it.

1010
01:31:05,710 --> 01:31:09,546
l have lots of aches and pains.
And this pump isn't. . .

1011
01:31:10,506 --> 01:31:11,923
And there's the fistula.

1012
01:31:12,091 --> 01:31:16,219
You're just worrying, Lope.
You're spoiled, that's the problem.

1013
01:31:17,430 --> 01:31:21,141
Excuse me a moment.
l forgot my pills.

1014
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:30,108
He's finished. . .

1015
01:31:43,414 --> 01:31:47,292
My memory's getting worse.
l always forget. . .

1016
01:31:47,752 --> 01:31:49,085
The pill.

1017
01:31:49,837 --> 01:31:52,255
Pass me the milk, please.
Thank you.

1018
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:53,757
What an aroma!

1019
01:31:53,925 --> 01:31:55,217
With this exquisite product

1020
01:31:55,384 --> 01:31:58,428
how can we not pity
those who settle for tea?

1021
01:31:58,596 --> 01:32:00,263
l agree entirely.

1022
01:32:00,431 --> 01:32:02,057
Saturna is a great cook.

1023
01:32:02,225 --> 01:32:04,309
lt's so creamy and thick!

1024
01:32:04,852 --> 01:32:06,144
Just right.

1025
01:32:06,354 --> 01:32:09,356
We get nothing like this at home.

1026
01:32:10,191 --> 01:32:13,193
l admit it, if Don Lope
wasn't so kind as to invite me. . .

1027
01:32:13,361 --> 01:32:15,403
A little more sugar, please.

1028
01:32:16,072 --> 01:32:17,155
Thank you.

1029
01:32:17,323 --> 01:32:21,451
lf you can't enjoy it as much at home,
it's because you don't want to.

1030
01:32:22,245 --> 01:32:25,997
He's talking about a little income
that my parents left me.

1031
01:32:26,165 --> 01:32:29,626
A little income?
l'd happily settle for half.

1032
01:32:29,794 --> 01:32:33,046
So, Don Candido,
are your emoluments not enough?

1033
01:32:33,214 --> 01:32:35,131
We earn less than a laborer.

1034
01:32:35,383 --> 01:32:38,510
And l'm maintaining a widowed sister
and her three children.

1035
01:32:42,890 --> 01:32:47,978
That's enough, Don Lope will think
we come here for an ulterior motiνe.

1036
01:32:48,854 --> 01:32:51,940
Our host knows it's not my custom
to ask for myself.

1037
01:32:52,358 --> 01:32:53,692
l νouch for that.

1038
01:32:55,152 --> 01:32:58,154
- Another cup?
- Just half full.

1039
01:33:07,373 --> 01:33:11,209
After all, life isn't as dark
as many believe.

1040
01:33:12,837 --> 01:33:14,504
lt's snowing heaνily.

1041
01:33:15,339 --> 01:33:17,257
But we're warm in here.

1042
01:33:18,384 --> 01:33:19,593
Oh, my!

1043
01:33:45,620 --> 01:33:55,211
Tristana!

1044
01:34:19,445 --> 01:34:21,905
What is it?
Do you feel ill?

1045
01:34:23,908 --> 01:34:25,575
ls it indigestion?

1046
01:34:27,244 --> 01:34:29,037
You want some herb tea?

1047
01:34:31,540 --> 01:34:34,292
No, Tristana, this is more serious.

1048
01:34:35,044 --> 01:34:37,337
l've a pain here that's killing me.

1049
01:34:37,505 --> 01:34:39,214
Call the doctor!

1050
01:34:39,924 --> 01:34:42,384
Do you really feel that bad?

1051
01:34:43,969 --> 01:34:45,428
Call the doctor!

1052
01:35:10,287 --> 01:35:12,288
Get me 240.

1053
01:35:13,541 --> 01:35:15,709
lt's me. Dr. Miquis?

1054
01:35:17,461 --> 01:35:20,046
Listen, he's in great pain.

1055
01:35:20,548 --> 01:35:21,589
Very well.

1056
01:35:23,050 --> 01:35:24,759
Come as soon as you can.

1057
01:35:48,492 --> 01:35:51,786
Lope. . .

1058
01:35:53,914 --> 01:35:55,915
Dr. Miquis is on his way.

1059
01:35:58,919 --> 01:36:02,797
Don't you hear me, Lope?
Don't you hear me?

1060
01:38:28,903 --> 01:38:31,404
