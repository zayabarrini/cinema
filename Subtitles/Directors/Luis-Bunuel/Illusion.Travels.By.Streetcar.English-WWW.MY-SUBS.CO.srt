Dreams Travel
on Streetcars

3
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,172
Mexico

4
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:48,908
One of the great
cities of the world...

5
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:52,212
...is the setting of the most
varied and puzzling events...

6
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:54,514
... that are the pulse...

7
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:56,316
...of its daily life.

8
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:58,750
In spite of its transcendence,

9
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:02,386
millions of men
and women write,

10
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:03,782
hour after hour,

11
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,720
their brief and simple stories.

12
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:09,596
Their actions and words...

13
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:11,498
...always tend towards
the realization of a dream.

14
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:14,592
Of a wish... of a fantasy.

15
00:02:17,203 --> 00:02:18,795
Together, they...

16
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:22,739
...give shape to the huge
swarm that is city life.

17
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:28,882
We will randomly focus
on a corner...

18
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:30,873
...of our great city.

19
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:33,284
Thus...

20
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:36,379
... this film is
but another anecdote,

21
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:38,786
simple and almost trivial,

22
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:40,960
of life in the working

23
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,554
...poverty-stricken
classes of the common people.

24
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,422
Those who travel
on streetcars.

25
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:55,431
All right, take her away.

26
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:01,003
Again.

27
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:03,614
I told you not to come in here.

28
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:06,853
You're so stubborn,
you're worse than mules.

29
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,252
Professor, there goes the train.

30
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:15,261
That's enough, already.

31
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:17,263
Hey, what's wrong with that guy?

32
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:18,464
He almost blew my head off.

33
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:21,126
I'm getting tired of him.

34
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:32,641
You're too old to play train.

35
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:35,111
Is your livelihood a game?

36
00:03:35,181 --> 00:03:36,808
I never step over the line.

37
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:39,441
If you feel you're so smart,
take my post.

38
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:40,508
Not that smart, professor.

39
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:42,322
We owe everything we know to you.

40
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:43,414
Flatterer.

41
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,424
So, did you really fix it?

42
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:49,461
The problem was in the magnets.

43
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:51,262
Not bad, not bad.

44
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:54,400
But how could you finish
it so fast?

45
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:55,957
Let's notify the head of shop.

46
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,264
- Are you sure it's number 1 33?
- Sure.

47
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:05,572
- Nobody could've changed the number.
- Fine by me.

48
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:08,212
These boys' motives
seem reasonable enough.

49
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,515
Let's talk to the head of traffic.

50
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:11,850
Come with me.

51
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:23,656
There's a report on 1 33.

52
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,264
One week to be repaired.

53
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:28,201
It was supposed to be put back...

54
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:30,362
...to work exactly on Christmas Eve.

55
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:33,037
You are six days early.

56
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:35,106
- Who fixed it?
- Our buddy here.

57
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:35,842
And who are you?

58
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:38,072
Tobìas Hernàndez,
nick named "Tarrajas".

59
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:39,473
Let me explain, sir.

60
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:41,945
It was practically nothing.

61
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,382
What do you all have to say?

62
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:46,345
Two simple crew members...

63
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:48,417
...turned out to be more efficient...

64
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:50,989
...than our own
specialized mechanics.

65
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:53,522
They were my apprentices, sir.

66
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,992
What will we do with that train?

67
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:58,862
Give me the information I asked for.

68
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:03,833
Number 1 33's papers, sir,
and this memo.

69
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:09,275
Number 1 33 must be sent
to the yard, it's useless.

70
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:11,766
It will be replaced by
one of our new streetcars.

71
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:14,005
Why didn't I see this memo?

72
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,916
I haven't had time
to go over the mail yet.

73
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:19,248
No time, what an excuse.

74
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:21,615
Give the respective orders.

75
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:24,222
You heard him, sit down and listen.

76
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,348
Boss, what about us?

77
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:28,584
You may stay on at the company.

78
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,230
Otherwise, you'll get your pay.

79
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,801
We proved No. 1 33 isn't useless.

80
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:37,827
- We fixed it.
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.

81
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:42,338
Just a minute.

82
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:45,244
Don't any of you forget...

83
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:47,906
...that too much of anything
is detrimental.

84
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:50,412
Even efficiency.

85
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,819
Hey, where are you going?

86
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:06,426
- To break down No. 1 33?
- Stop joking around.

87
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:07,827
All right, men.

88
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,366
Patience, you will win
on some other day.

89
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:12,026
What about that scrap?

90
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:15,197
Let's take number 1 33
to the shops.

91
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:18,732
Leave it to me,
you get rid of the scrap.

92
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,212
See you.

93
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:28,445
We've had it, "Curls".

94
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:31,249
A crooked tree never straightens.

95
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:32,382
Tough luck.

96
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:35,285
You behave, and look at what happens.

97
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:37,422
Poor 1 33 is off to the graveyard.

98
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,554
And with it, our stable job.

99
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,997
It dried up, buddy.

100
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,446
What about those beer cartons?

101
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,177
It's for the streetcar
inaugural party.

102
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,686
I can't wait.

103
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:04,052
Neither can l,
I'm dying for a beer.

104
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:05,988
Why don't we go for it?

105
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,617
No, we have to take
the scrap to the yard.

106
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:11,356
Let's do it tomorrow,
it's already 5:00.

107
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:13,863
We're almost off, aren't we?

108
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:16,531
You've got to give your body
what it craves for.

109
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:32,245
WELL...SO WHAT?

110
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:35,446
Do you think we like your
stupid television so much?

111
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:37,785
It's not like we're
going to wear it off.

112
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,725
I've been thrown out
of better places.

113
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:42,455
Come on, we don't
need to beg anywhere.

114
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:45,531
- Why don't you stop?
- Come on, leave them alone.

115
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:49,991
No way, what are you
talking about?

116
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,477
Does anyone have a mirror?

117
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:11,750
Here, Lupita, right away.

118
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:13,223
You don't even need it.

119
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,816
You look beautiful.

120
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:18,090
Pablo, cut it off,
you're just teasing me.

121
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,465
When will you accept, Lupita?

122
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:21,729
You know my love
for you is true.

123
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:26,801
- Do you really want to know?
- My future's in your hands.

124
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,668
They day you drive your own car.

125
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,511
Isn't there a Ford in your future?

126
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,503
I thought you only
cared about true love.

127
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,915
Oh, don't listen to me.

128
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:38,145
I'm a joker, you take
things seriously.

129
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:40,242
You get upset right away.

130
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:43,316
Don't touch.

131
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:49,793
Tarrajas.

132
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:55,695
There's Lupe again,
with that damn Pablo.

133
00:08:56,802 --> 00:08:59,566
You're her brother,
you should control her.

134
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:01,507
Don't you have any authority?

135
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:03,709
It's just fun and games.

136
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,444
That's how it always begins.

137
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:07,380
Don't you remember?

138
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,714
Don't get confused, I'm
in a class all by myself.

139
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:15,382
You know my
intentions are honorable.

140
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:25,759
- Why are you so late?
- What? What time is it?

141
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,297
Have you been drinking again?

142
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:29,596
Drinking, yes, I was.

143
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:32,638
- Blow into my eye.
- What?! The nerve.

144
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:37,209
You're shameless, and it's
all this perverter's fault.

145
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,105
You know, Lupita, today...

146
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:42,271
...Tarrajas and l
were greatly disappointed.

147
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:45,351
With great pain do we see
the injustice of the world.

148
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:47,717
You don't say! What happened?

149
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:50,620
Nothing, our lips are sealed.

150
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,592
You couple of busy bodies.

151
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,684
What about the Christmas play?

152
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,250
That's right, I forgot.

153
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:57,887
Shepherds, shepherds.

154
00:09:58,064 --> 00:10:03,696
Boys change in number 7,
girls change in number 4.

155
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,407
You're not dressed,
what are you waiting for?

156
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:13,343
Go on, we're about to begin.

157
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:16,447
- Lupe.
- What do you want?

158
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:18,184
Why the long face?

159
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:20,345
You give me no
reason to be happy.

160
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:21,952
It's always me.

161
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:24,546
Somebody is bound
to cheer you up.

162
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:27,421
I'm not a bell to be
rung by anybody.

163
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:29,825
What an intimate conversation.

164
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:33,365
You're hinting,
and right in my face.

165
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,601
You're jealous, Pablo.

166
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:37,466
Me, jealous of that scoundrel?

167
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,604
If you could see envy...

168
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:42,965
He quit the union, he
can go anywhere in a car.

169
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:46,145
Look at him now, so fancy
and with all that dough.

170
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,947
Oh, he's just a flatterer.

171
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:50,381
No wonder they call him
the polisher.

172
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:52,578
Professor.

173
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:56,378
That's all I needed,
what are you doing here?

174
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,957
You should be dressed.

175
00:10:57,957 --> 00:10:59,117
We were on our way.

176
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:02,490
You wanted to set an example,
like real actors.

177
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:06,098
Look at the state you're in.
Let's go, move.

178
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:07,725
That way.

179
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:27,016
Come Lupita, dance this
one with me, will you?

180
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:29,247
- Of course, Pablo.
- Come on.

181
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:40,132
I just came to have
a bit of punch, Mercedes...

182
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:42,134
...and I'm back at my post.

183
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:43,726
I left the shops all alone.

184
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:46,563
Put some spirit in it.

185
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:49,402
Gladly, and I'll make
it double just for you.

186
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:50,873
Thanks, Mechitas.

187
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:53,236
So, you left the shops unguarded?

188
00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:57,049
What could possibly happen?
The tools...

189
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,641
...are kept under lock.

190
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:00,378
What else could they steal?

191
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,215
Who would ever take
a streetcar?

192
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,021
Come on, Mechitas.

193
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:10,623
Stop Lucifer, stop.

194
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,421
Among all the angels,
I am the Celestial captain

195
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:16,060
Gabriel and Michael, come forth.

196
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,322
May this be a lesson to you.

197
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,199
Take that thing away
and change the harness.

198
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:40,209
Since I've been thrown out
of the Catholic world...

199
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:44,416
...from this moment on they
shall be my diabolical resolve.

200
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:47,454
I will wear the mask.

201
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,763
And frighten with the tunic.

202
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:54,290
Come, plague, pour down, rain.

203
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:58,800
May they not reap wheat,
corn or beans.

204
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:00,769
May you all get diseased...

205
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:03,131
...and die of heat.

206
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:07,003
Don't spite me, evil Satan.

207
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:55,586
- Come on, Adam, where are you?
- Here, here I am.

208
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:57,656
Whatcha doing? I can't see you.

209
00:15:57,656 --> 00:15:59,351
I'm in the middle of something.

210
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:00,583
Where's Eva?

211
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:02,693
Fixing me a drink.

212
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:04,795
Is there any fruit?

213
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:09,401
- She ate it with me.
- Come to my presence.

214
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,463
So, you're eating an apple.

215
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:19,877
You shall find out what
this evil deed brings.

216
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,647
Remember I forbade it?

217
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,172
- Yes, yes.
- I don't.

218
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,682
Then, get out of here.

219
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:29,013
Just a minute.

220
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:30,954
Who was the inciter?

221
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:33,149
His excellence over there.

222
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,327
Why, it is the traitor himself.

223
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:39,286
Before such defiance,
daughters of my entrails...

224
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:41,196
...come a whim of oppression.

225
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,329
You shall suffer
your original sin.

226
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:47,429
You wanted to know the science
of good and evil.

227
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:52,239
I'll send you a redeemer.
You, perfidious woman...

228
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,175
...shall bear your children in pain.

229
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:56,338
And you, Adam, for your disobedience...

230
00:16:56,415 --> 00:17:00,112
...will have to support them
with your breath and sweat.

231
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:14,924
Grab the sword, Michael,
and quickly tend to him.

232
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:17,965
Stand up, brave woman,
I challenge you.

233
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:22,201
Here I am in person
ready to put you out.

234
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,906
My God.

235
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:29,938
Bravo.

236
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:38,988
INTERMlSSlON
5 MlNUTES

237
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:49,259
Meche, pour me another one,
for the road.

238
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:52,531
Well, how many roads
are you taking?

239
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:54,697
Mr. Braulio has many horses.

240
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,171
Strong horses that he forsook...

241
00:17:57,342 --> 00:17:58,969
...to come to this feast.

242
00:17:59,044 --> 00:18:01,847
Those strong horses, young man...

243
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:05,339
...are nobody's business
but mine.

244
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,419
So, what could happen to them?

245
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:10,855
Nothing, if we flatter
Mr. Braulio's taste.

246
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:14,290
Hey Mechita, do you
have two cold ones there?

247
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,895
Oh, I sold out a while ago.

248
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:19,261
Well, what a gloomy party.

249
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:24,267
After coming all the way over
here, there's nothing to drink.

250
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:30,736
We'll change our clothes
in a minute...

251
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:33,846
...and go fetch the carton
we saw in the afternoon.

252
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:36,542
The guard has a long
time to go, anyway.

253
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:57,058
Come on, wait over here.

254
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:59,204
If you knew this pain...

255
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:02,330
This pain that is
destroying my soul.

256
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:04,409
Our future, you understand?

257
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,578
We are smaller than dust.

258
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:09,741
I've got a knot in here,
a knot.

259
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,317
Look.

260
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:15,778
At who? I don't see anyone.

261
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:19,755
Nobody. I'm done talking
to you, that's it.

262
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:22,294
Let's see that carton,
you stone soul.

263
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:25,197
Stone soul, me? Over a carton.

264
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:27,495
Here, I've got my coat anyway.

265
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:33,503
Didn't I say stone?
Can't you see number 1 33?

266
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:38,276
Yes, I can. I see it
and don't want to remember.

267
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:42,576
Was there ever a streetcar
as dignified as that one?

268
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:45,343
Quiet, please don't say that.

269
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:47,608
Come on, be a man.

270
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:51,678
Go, don't just stay there.
Do something important, Curls.

271
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:54,625
Do something important,
that's true.

272
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,129
Don't just stay there, Curls.

273
00:19:57,129 --> 00:20:00,530
And call me by my name,
you know my name.

274
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:02,034
Juan Godìnez, isn't it?

275
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,369
So, what's wrong with "Curls"?

276
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:05,961
Isn't that what everybody calls you?

277
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:09,436
Aren't you the cashier on the
streetcar collecting the coins?

278
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:10,872
Well, then it's Curls.

279
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:13,376
They call me that
out of sheer envy.

280
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:15,309
No offend intended.

281
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:16,909
Am I to blame for...

282
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:19,506
...having been born
with curly hair?

283
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:21,653
With decent features, huh?

284
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:26,358
Well, you're making me sick
with all your showing off.

285
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:29,987
Curls, I mean Godìnez.

286
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:33,465
Changing the subject,
you think I haven't noticed...

287
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:35,899
...that change my name around?

288
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:39,027
You call me "tall ajas"
instead of Tarrajas.

289
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:41,173
- Tall, me? How tall?
- No.

290
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:42,970
- No.
- Why, when?

291
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:46,670
Stop giving me nick names.
Tarrajas, Tarrajas.

292
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:51,545
My father, may he rest in peace,
left behind his work and energy...

293
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:54,786
...for the good of the
family name, that's why.

294
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:56,185
Sorry, buddy.

295
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:57,480
I'm sorry.

296
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:00,789
Look.

297
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:02,955
Here you go.

298
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:06,497
That's where we learned
the trade.

299
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:11,498
They call it "square-wheels"
because it's old.

300
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:14,970
Truck drivers
try to smash into it.

301
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:19,737
There's no need for that,
there's no need.

302
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,604
Professor, what happened
in the play?

303
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:47,934
You should refund the tickets.

304
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:52,773
- Calm down, relax.
- Don't give me that.

305
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:57,282
Miss, didn't I ask you
to look after them?

306
00:21:57,282 --> 00:21:58,806
They got away, professor.

307
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:01,444
Writing for people like
that is a waste of time.

308
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,248
Where could they be?

309
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:05,447
They went to get some beer,
they'll be right back.

310
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:07,822
I'm not worried about the devil.

311
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:10,987
I could stand in for him,
but the other one...

312
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:14,429
That's what we get for giving
God's role to anyone.

313
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:17,168
Listen, Lupita.

314
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:21,532
Why don't we go out to look at
the car? Then, you can decide.

315
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:24,068
- Let's go.
- Let's.

316
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,988
Don't worry, Lupita.

317
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:38,123
They must be out on the town.

318
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:40,921
I'm not worried,
it's not like he's a child.

319
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,486
Get in. Isn't this
better than a streetcar?

320
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:47,689
- It is, but the deal is off.
- Why?

321
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:50,593
Come on, you know
I respect you.

322
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:55,606
I'll take you to a lovely
hill overlooking the city.

323
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,070
And we'll listen to the radio.

324
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:59,366
That's nice.

325
00:23:00,946 --> 00:23:03,210
- In that case, yes.
- In that case, no.

326
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:14,522
We're young,
we'll find another job.

327
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:19,028
We could even start a business
together, always together.

328
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:21,154
Thanks, brother.

329
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:24,258
But nothing eases this
pain I feel inside.

330
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:27,633
Hey, Tarrajas.

331
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:31,242
Why don't we push it
so it gets some fresh air?

332
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:35,177
Swell, that's exactly what
I was going to say.

333
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:43,380
Tarrajas, why don't we
take it to the dance?

334
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:45,820
We'll take everyone for a ride.

335
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:47,449
You said it, man.

336
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:51,560
I'm already in a rut,
I might as well do something.

337
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:54,459
Whatever you say, driver.

338
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:58,793
- There.
- A little more.

339
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:19,588
So, it wasn't me, it was you.

340
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:23,990
Let's call it quits,
what if something happens?

341
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:27,963
I've been a watchman for 20 years,
nothing has ever happened.

342
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:32,370
Especially now with the
inflation, I won't go until...

343
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:35,533
- It's up to you.
- I'll be responsible.

344
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:38,308
You said it was the inflation.

345
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,707
There's a lot of money going round.

346
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:43,805
- What's wrong with that?
- What I mean...

347
00:24:43,915 --> 00:24:47,715
...is that it's both
the cause and the effect.

348
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:49,844
About the money going round...

349
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:53,447
...being more than the
merchandise that's sold.

350
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:57,362
That's why prices
keep going up.

351
00:24:57,362 --> 00:24:59,030
That's easy to see.

352
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:03,364
And since the workers'
salaries haven't increased...

353
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:08,306
...the result is a lower
real value of income.

354
00:25:08,306 --> 00:25:09,908
It's the pits.

355
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:12,433
So, that's inflation for you.

356
00:25:12,577 --> 00:25:15,011
It causes poverty among
common people...

357
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:18,250
...while industrialists
and businessmen...

358
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,810
...keep getting richer
and fancier.

359
00:25:30,595 --> 00:25:34,588
It's grateful, it's working
better than ever.

360
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:38,532
Look, it's getting late.

361
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:39,871
Oh, my.

362
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:45,704
Stop here.

363
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:48,711
The light's off,
they seem to be closed.

364
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:52,350
- Mr. Braulio must be coming now.
- Braulio who?

365
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:55,683
- The watchman.
- Yes, but he must be pretty drunk.

366
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:57,152
Hey, what's with them?

367
00:26:00,425 --> 00:26:02,561
Looks like they're
coming from a party.

368
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:04,654
Go find out.

369
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:09,129
Yes, sure. I'm always
the one doing the dirty work.

370
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,169
I'll go then, open up.

371
00:26:13,438 --> 00:26:15,702
You're always the chicken.

372
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:20,903
Oh, well, if it isn't
Juanito and Tarrajas.

373
00:26:21,112 --> 00:26:22,272
Where are you going?

374
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:24,247
To the play, where else?

375
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:25,715
You've got to be jesting.

376
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:28,019
Returning nonchalantly...

377
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:29,953
...after standing everybody up.

378
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:33,388
Leave all that to the
faithful, right Curls?

379
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:35,627
How come you're here
at this hour?

380
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:37,390
Won't you give us a lift?

381
00:26:37,462 --> 00:26:38,588
There's no transportation.

382
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:40,788
Frankly, that's why we came.

383
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:43,902
Home delivery, now that we can.

384
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:46,838
- Right, Tarrajitas?
- Sure thing, get in.

385
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:48,897
- Thanks.
- Thanks a lot.

386
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:54,143
Hey, you're not fooling me.

387
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:56,279
I bet you got in trouble.

388
00:26:56,414 --> 00:27:00,475
My buddy here will fill you
in, dear brother-in-law.

389
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:03,849
Just who are you calling
brother-in-law?

390
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:08,382
Oh, that's just our style,
don't take it seriously.

391
00:27:08,493 --> 00:27:09,755
I don't take anything seriously.

392
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:12,761
Come on, they're
going to eat all the food.

393
00:27:14,532 --> 00:27:16,090
Let me explain, Lupita.

394
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:21,235
It's an insignificant manifestation
of trust by the company.

395
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:25,604
They entrusted us with the pilot
service as a distinction.

396
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:28,042
Pilot service, what's that?

397
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:31,307
I'll explain it later,
we're taking you home now.

398
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:34,475
You can't take me anywhere
you want whenever you want.

399
00:27:34,552 --> 00:27:37,077
Come on, are we going
to stay here all night?

400
00:27:37,188 --> 00:27:40,749
Juanito, Tarrajitas, hurry,
there won't be any food left.

401
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:43,191
The passengers are complaining.

402
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:46,354
Come on, get in. Get in, sis.

403
00:27:54,472 --> 00:27:56,702
And now, Lupita.

404
00:27:57,175 --> 00:28:00,076
Let me explain to you
and to the rest...

405
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:02,642
...what this pilot service is about.

406
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,611
We're not charging for the service.

407
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:10,344
We're treating everyone
with the utmost courtesy.

408
00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:12,817
That's the pilot service...

409
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:14,781
...which will forever...

410
00:28:14,926 --> 00:28:17,156
...educate the streetcar employees...

411
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:21,355
...and the clients,
which will surely reciprocate.

412
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:23,464
Now, for example.

413
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:26,698
I haven't even
asked the musicians.

414
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:28,269
How far are you going?

415
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:31,900
To the corner of Peru and Argentina,
if you please.

416
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:35,413
Mechitas, do you still live
near the slaughterhouse?

417
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:36,946
I do, Juanito.

418
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:39,011
To the slaughterhouse, driver.

419
00:28:45,323 --> 00:28:49,919
SLAUGHTERHOUSE

420
00:29:02,974 --> 00:29:05,465
Philharmonic gentlemen.

421
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:07,444
It's just a manner of speech.

422
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:11,280
Why don't you play
a song for us all?

423
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:14,317
- We've got time to spare.
- Why, of course.

424
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:16,919
As soon as we're done eating.

425
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:19,218
Curls, after all you aren't...

426
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:21,415
...as bad as I thought you were.

427
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:22,482
Thanks a lot.

428
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:23,424
Sticky fingers.

429
00:29:23,728 --> 00:29:27,164
- Lupita, kick, kick.
- Thank you.

430
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:28,763
Just a kick.

431
00:29:57,896 --> 00:30:00,524
MEXlCO ClTY SLAUGHTERHOUSE

432
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:05,804
- Thanks a lot, Juanito.
- Thank you, Mrs. Mechita.

433
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,533
We'll be seeing each other, huh?

434
00:30:07,605 --> 00:30:09,140
- See you tomorrow, Mechita.
- Yes.

435
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,903
See you tomorrow, Mechita.

436
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:17,046
Oh my, look at what's coming.

437
00:30:17,782 --> 00:30:19,579
I'm not opening the door.

438
00:30:30,094 --> 00:30:31,391
That's really cute.

439
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:34,328
I don't know, I have this feeling.

440
00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:36,568
So, pilot service, huh?

441
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:39,264
- Take the streetcar back.
- No.

442
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:40,764
Yeah, too bad.

443
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:44,232
They're expecting the gondola
that picks them up daily.

444
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:46,573
They're going to tell on us.

445
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:50,670
- You must be kidding.
- Open up, let them in.

446
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:02,188
We aren't charging for the service.

447
00:31:02,293 --> 00:31:05,194
They're taking us just
for the fun of it.

448
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:07,696
Besides, it's warmer than the gondola.

449
00:31:07,932 --> 00:31:10,230
Thanks, may the Lord repay you.

450
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:12,426
- Thank you so much.
- Thanks.

451
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,769
- Can I come on with this?
- Go ahead.

452
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,749
Divine Providence sent a
streetcar instead of the gondola.

453
00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:28,276
It's freezing,
lucky we're cozy in here.

454
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:34,017
Come on, Mrs. Panchita.

455
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:37,195
You have it all, you don't
know what it feels like.

456
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:38,287
But us...

457
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:41,499
Too bad, but if they
sold your tongue in pieces...

458
00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:43,967
- What?
- The whole city would be poisoned.

459
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:45,764
Stop blurting those things out.

460
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:51,031
- Come on, we're leaving.
- Get on, get on.

461
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:55,775
Mr. Prudencio asked you to wait.

462
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,148
He's coming with his people.

463
00:31:57,148 --> 00:31:59,742
- Yes, but he better hurry.
- Okay.

464
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,114
Heavens.

465
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:04,651
Who's he?

466
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:07,790
The Duke of Ordanto.

467
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,360
Oh, come on.

468
00:32:24,976 --> 00:32:26,102
Let's see.

469
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:50,659
- Mister, mister.
- Huh?

470
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:54,172
- A little present.
- No thank you, madam.

471
00:32:54,172 --> 00:32:56,441
Don't disdain me,
they're delicious.

472
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:58,375
No, it's not disdain, but...

473
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:00,878
Take it, it's sincere.

474
00:33:00,878 --> 00:33:02,971
Yes, ma'am, thank you, but...

475
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:04,512
The lady over here wants some.

476
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:07,146
- You, girl?
- Sure, thank you very much.

477
00:33:07,218 --> 00:33:09,482
Miss, take these bears as well.

478
00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:11,044
Much obliged, ma'am.

479
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:45,449
No ma'am, we're not charging.

480
00:33:45,556 --> 00:33:47,990
Thank you very much, thank you.

481
00:33:57,935 --> 00:33:59,232
Look at it.

482
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:04,369
- Oh, it's so cute.
- It's the Lord of the Column.

483
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:10,982
- I'm so scared.
- What?

484
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:14,679
That's why I told you to
slowly uncover the crucifix.

485
00:34:14,819 --> 00:34:17,379
Maybe that will
make them fear God.

486
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:20,115
The fact that it's free
seems pretty fishy.

487
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:23,421
Nowadays, nobody gives
anything for free.

488
00:34:23,528 --> 00:34:24,893
And at this hour.

489
00:34:25,196 --> 00:34:28,063
Maybe they'll try to mug
us come a lonely spot.

490
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,723
- Really?
- May the Lord help us.

491
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:39,109
Excuse me, where are
you taking your icon?

492
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:42,007
To be blessed at the church.

493
00:34:42,313 --> 00:34:43,644
Why at this hour?

494
00:34:43,781 --> 00:34:46,944
Because it was around this
time that I invoked him.

495
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:50,417
He granted me the grace
of healing this girl.

496
00:34:51,155 --> 00:34:53,146
Poor thing, what was wrong?

497
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:54,815
A miscarriage.

498
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:59,625
We're poor, and don't have
any money to buy indulgences.

499
00:35:00,798 --> 00:35:03,367
I had seen these ladies before...

500
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:05,801
...always with their little icon.

501
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:06,971
So what?

502
00:35:06,971 --> 00:35:09,872
It's theirs, they can
do with it as they please.

503
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:12,043
It's their conscience, not mine.

504
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:14,136
I don't want any fat
guy meddling in this.

505
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:17,375
- It's your problem.
- What's it to you?

506
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:19,817
- Quiet, busy bodies.
- Busy body.

507
00:35:19,817 --> 00:35:23,048
Butt out, I wasn't going to
give anything but now I will.

508
00:35:23,187 --> 00:35:25,052
May God almighty give you more.

509
00:35:25,189 --> 00:35:26,520
- Heretic.
- Thanks.

510
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:29,992
- lmagine that, what a fatso.
- Thanks.

511
00:35:30,094 --> 00:35:32,619
We're here gentlemen,
you can get off now.

512
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:34,722
Well it's about time.

513
00:35:34,832 --> 00:35:38,503
Come on guys, it's cold.

514
00:35:38,503 --> 00:35:40,505
Go on, hurry up.

515
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:41,472
Let's go.

516
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:51,580
Who sent this one?
Looks like a nut.

517
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,449
- Watch that gut.
- Whoa.

518
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,899
Come right back and
no more fun?

519
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:13,197
Go to sleep, I'll be right back.

520
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:16,431
I haven't forgiven your
toying with the neighbors.

521
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:19,403
- Good night Lupita.
- Good night.

522
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:43,060
Are you sure the watchman
is at the warehouse?

523
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:44,669
I'm certain of it.

524
00:36:44,669 --> 00:36:47,137
- Where do we put it at this hour?
- Well...

525
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:50,731
-...I don't know.
- OK, I got it.

526
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,609
We'll put it up in the
storage room.

527
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:55,712
We'll take it to the
shop early.

528
00:36:55,813 --> 00:36:57,838
When we figure
the boss has arrived.

529
00:36:57,949 --> 00:37:01,350
That's it, we'll figure
when the boss arrives.

530
00:37:01,452 --> 00:37:03,215
And when the boss has arrived...

531
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:04,854
What do we tell him?

532
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:06,890
That we were testing the car.

533
00:37:07,024 --> 00:37:08,457
He'll be okay with that.

534
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:56,873
- Tarrajas, Tarrajas.
- What's up?

535
00:37:58,609 --> 00:37:59,940
Ask the Lord to
bless my soul.

536
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:02,103
Guadalajara, Guadalajara.

537
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:05,247
- You smell like wet beer.
- Stop joking.

538
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:07,840
We need to return the streetcar.

539
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:11,615
- What streetcar?
- The one we took last night.

540
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,191
Heavens, what have we done?

541
00:38:14,191 --> 00:38:16,216
- Don't you remember?
- Now I do.

542
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:19,323
I can't stand this hangover.

543
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:21,227
I was dressed like a devil.

544
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,267
- My horns still hurt.
- Come on.

545
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:25,292
If they notice it missing
they'll think we stole it.

546
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:28,167
Wait, I've always been honest.

547
00:38:28,272 --> 00:38:28,795
Yeah?

548
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:31,205
Well, sort of honest, anyway.

549
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:33,105
Come on, hurry up.

550
00:38:35,379 --> 00:38:37,074
Could we get fired?

551
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,183
They would put us in jail.

552
00:38:39,183 --> 00:38:39,740
Oh no.

553
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,381
But we still have time
to get into the shops.

554
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:43,921
With the other cars.

555
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:46,446
I'll get him to give us
the day off today.

556
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:30,468
Forget it, we can't get in.

557
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:31,526
What do we do now?

558
00:39:31,669 --> 00:39:34,661
We'll have to wait.
Back up anyway.

559
00:39:48,953 --> 00:39:50,614
Well, let's see what happens.

560
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:51,956
Holy virgin Barbara...

561
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:54,390
...dear God, we're in
deep this time.

562
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:07,237
Twisted again.

563
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:09,238
We have to go the whole route.

564
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,331
Let's get off and leave it.

565
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:12,510
Let them find out.

566
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,841
They'd catch us right away.

567
00:40:13,978 --> 00:40:16,879
Everyone we drove last
night will say we did it.

568
00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:18,946
I'll put the Special sign on.

569
00:40:19,016 --> 00:40:20,847
Then no one will get on.

570
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,084
SPEClAL

571
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:30,186
Let me drive, we may get lucky.

572
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,920
- Tarrajas.
- What?

573
00:40:34,064 --> 00:40:36,400
Remember that escape route for
gondolas?

574
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,765
I was thinking about that.

575
00:40:37,968 --> 00:40:38,736
What if we take that route?

576
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:40,533
And go back the other way.

577
00:40:40,671 --> 00:40:42,161
Okay, give me the keys.

578
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:44,803
Make the sign of the cross.

579
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:59,153
Wait, wait.

580
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:00,952
He won't be long, kids.

581
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,595
Maybe it's Lorenzana.

582
00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:05,629
You have good eye sight.

583
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,620
Try to read the sign there.

584
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:13,938
Yes, miss, it says special.

585
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:15,539
- Are you sure?
- Yes, miss.

586
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:16,665
Then that's the one.

587
00:41:18,843 --> 00:41:19,844
Sir...

588
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:22,642
Will you stop the traffic
for the kids to cross?

589
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:24,073
Children.

590
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:32,183
Order.

591
00:41:32,389 --> 00:41:33,481
Run, run.

592
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:47,032
We waited over 1 5 minutes.

593
00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:49,002
Here's the order,
climb on children.

594
00:41:49,106 --> 00:41:49,970
Yes, miss.

595
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:53,202
Get on children, but don't push.

596
00:42:01,118 --> 00:42:03,552
We thought you weren't
coming. Read it.

597
00:42:06,624 --> 00:42:07,989
Going to Xochimilco, huh?

598
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:11,185
Yes, we make this field
trip twice each year.

599
00:42:11,428 --> 00:42:13,097
So, only twice a year?

600
00:42:13,097 --> 00:42:15,224
Yes sir, always by streetcar.

601
00:42:15,332 --> 00:42:17,892
Because it's a very
safe way to travel.

602
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:19,133
Excuse me.

603
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:21,132
I told you.

604
00:42:21,405 --> 00:42:22,736
It'll be worse if you argue.

605
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,270
There's a cloud
over our heads.

606
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:26,638
Take off.

607
00:42:36,987 --> 00:42:38,318
Good-bye, good-bye.

608
00:42:38,422 --> 00:42:39,514
Have fun.

609
00:42:41,959 --> 00:42:44,052
Behave, children.

610
00:42:44,428 --> 00:42:47,522
Let's have some order.

611
00:42:47,665 --> 00:42:50,862
You'll have to take
turns at the window.

612
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:53,704
Guys, shall we
sing our anthem?

613
00:42:53,704 --> 00:42:54,898
Yes, yes, yes.

614
00:42:54,972 --> 00:42:56,837
Alright, alright.

615
00:42:57,308 --> 00:42:58,206
Ready?

616
00:42:58,342 --> 00:42:58,808
Yes.

617
00:42:58,976 --> 00:43:01,877
One, two, three.

618
00:43:02,046 --> 00:43:06,250
Get up sleepyheads,
it's time...

619
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,252
...for work...

620
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:11,188
...which is also
the time....

621
00:43:11,188 --> 00:43:13,918
...that the cuckoo
is singing.

622
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:18,994
Get up, get up, the
cuckoo is singing.

623
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:24,123
Get up, get up, the
cuckoo is singing.

624
00:43:24,201 --> 00:43:26,669
Cuckoo, cuckoo.

625
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,829
What do we do with them now?

626
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:30,539
Anything but go
to the terminal.

627
00:43:31,241 --> 00:43:32,572
The supervisor might be there.

628
00:43:32,876 --> 00:43:34,673
If he see us, we're done for.

629
00:43:34,812 --> 00:43:36,575
We'll do it when you're ready.

630
00:43:36,647 --> 00:43:38,444
Let's pretend it broke down.

631
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:40,982
Let's dump the
kids and beat it.

632
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:45,479
Go to the back
of the line.

633
00:44:04,775 --> 00:44:06,970
Now you can't say
it's hard to see.

634
00:44:07,111 --> 00:44:09,102
Everything is
expensive nowadays.

635
00:44:16,887 --> 00:44:19,223
- Just a second.
- Don't rob me.

636
00:44:19,223 --> 00:44:20,791
The days of looting are back.

637
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:22,226
Of course, the
lady is right.

638
00:44:22,226 --> 00:44:23,921
You take advantage of us.

639
00:44:24,061 --> 00:44:24,962
- How so?
- Don't you know...

640
00:44:24,962 --> 00:44:26,395
...that prices are capped?

641
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,692
Don't you know this
is a free market?

642
00:44:28,766 --> 00:44:31,268
You can sell it
for up to 20 cents.

643
00:44:31,268 --> 00:44:33,637
- Doubling profits.
- So people assume.

644
00:44:33,637 --> 00:44:35,662
Wholesalers charge
us high prices.

645
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:37,366
Don't gouge us in turn.

646
00:44:37,474 --> 00:44:39,443
Then there's no
dough for you.

647
00:44:39,443 --> 00:44:42,776
That can't be, it's not fair.

648
00:44:53,424 --> 00:44:55,949
I need to talk to you.

649
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:57,357
What is it?

650
00:44:57,461 --> 00:45:01,090
Car 1 33 was missing
this morning.

651
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:04,334
Turns out that Curls
and your brother stole it.

652
00:45:04,435 --> 00:45:05,669
They made the pilot service run.

653
00:45:05,669 --> 00:45:07,432
They were finishing.

654
00:45:07,504 --> 00:45:09,440
Pilot run, my foot.

655
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,532
They drank and were playing.

656
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:13,201
I thought they were
making it up.

657
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:14,368
Just being mischievous.

658
00:45:14,511 --> 00:45:17,446
Well I'm afraid I'll
have to report them.

659
00:45:17,681 --> 00:45:19,444
Please don't,
they'll get fired.

660
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:21,750
You too, for
not doing your job.

661
00:45:21,919 --> 00:45:23,443
Better not say anything more.

662
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:26,045
I'll get them and
bring them right over.

663
00:45:26,156 --> 00:45:28,181
What if the company notices?

664
00:45:28,358 --> 00:45:29,484
But supposing they don't.

665
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,428
Be a pal, I'll go get them.

666
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:34,991
The scoundrels.

667
00:45:51,048 --> 00:45:53,107
- Lupita.
- I was looking for you.

668
00:45:53,217 --> 00:45:54,445
- For me?
- Yes.

669
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:56,576
I need a big favor from you.

670
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:57,448
Done deal.

671
00:45:57,521 --> 00:45:59,284
You'll take me
to find my brother?

672
00:45:59,356 --> 00:46:00,482
Sure, where is he?

673
00:46:00,557 --> 00:46:02,593
We have to find that out.

674
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:03,924
We'll find him, hop in.

675
00:46:03,994 --> 00:46:05,894
I just know he's on number 1 33.

676
00:46:22,546 --> 00:46:24,241
Sit down, children.

677
00:46:29,419 --> 00:46:30,852
He has no parents.

678
00:46:31,021 --> 00:46:32,420
How would you know?

679
00:46:32,523 --> 00:46:34,013
'Cause no one visits him.

680
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:35,989
His name's Lorenzana.

681
00:46:36,326 --> 00:46:38,294
There are many
Lorenzanas here.

682
00:46:38,362 --> 00:46:40,922
All of the orphaned ones.

683
00:46:41,865 --> 00:46:43,958
Hey Petingo, don't push.

684
00:46:44,434 --> 00:46:46,493
What's your name, Corpse?

685
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:47,865
What's yours, Petingo?

686
00:46:48,205 --> 00:46:49,406
I'll get you, Rigoleto...

687
00:46:49,406 --> 00:46:51,931
...for being so nosy.

688
00:46:52,543 --> 00:46:55,444
These kids are like
little demons.

689
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:57,979
Why are you fighting?
Get over here.

690
00:46:59,716 --> 00:47:01,741
Now stay there.

691
00:47:02,286 --> 00:47:02,980
Yes sir.

692
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:05,956
Watching kids is a
lot of responsibility.

693
00:47:05,956 --> 00:47:07,082
Yes, I see that.

694
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:09,250
Sometimes they are too much.

695
00:47:09,393 --> 00:47:10,189
Last year...

696
00:47:10,294 --> 00:47:12,455
...on a field trip to Xochimilco...

697
00:47:12,596 --> 00:47:15,087
...they told me that
a kid had gone down.

698
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:15,961
Did he drown?

699
00:47:16,099 --> 00:47:16,963
Well imagine.

700
00:47:17,034 --> 00:47:18,865
It was a struggle
to get him out.

701
00:47:19,236 --> 00:47:22,330
But since bad news
travels so fast...

702
00:47:22,406 --> 00:47:23,930
Where are you going, boy?

703
00:47:24,074 --> 00:47:26,065
When do we reach
the hospice?

704
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:27,468
You should've seen it.

705
00:47:27,578 --> 00:47:28,738
Hundreds of mothers.

706
00:47:28,812 --> 00:47:30,677
Trying to see the child's face.

707
00:47:30,781 --> 00:47:31,839
Naturally.

708
00:47:32,282 --> 00:47:35,183
Fortunately he wasn't
any son of theirs.

709
00:47:35,285 --> 00:47:36,411
He was a...

710
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:37,809
Lorenzana.

711
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:43,151
What is that for, sir?

712
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,554
Watch it, Chocolate.

713
00:47:45,562 --> 00:47:47,826
You heard, Chocolate.

714
00:47:48,298 --> 00:47:49,697
How much longer?

715
00:47:49,833 --> 00:47:50,765
Less than before.

716
00:47:51,001 --> 00:47:52,468
Hey, where are we?

717
00:47:53,303 --> 00:47:54,065
Churubusco.

718
00:47:55,339 --> 00:47:56,203
What time is it?

719
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:59,142
Time for you not
to ask questions.

720
00:47:59,142 --> 00:48:00,302
Hey.

721
00:48:01,511 --> 00:48:03,411
Where will you pretend
it broke down?

722
00:48:03,614 --> 00:48:06,105
At the next stop.

723
00:48:09,253 --> 00:48:10,845
Will you teach us how to drive?

724
00:48:10,921 --> 00:48:12,289
- You again?
- Show us how.

725
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:14,757
- Go on now.
- Oh, please.

726
00:48:26,837 --> 00:48:28,538
- Hey Lorenzana.
- What?

727
00:48:28,538 --> 00:48:30,005
There's your mom.

728
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:41,850
Go, go.

729
00:48:51,228 --> 00:48:52,388
What happened?

730
00:48:52,529 --> 00:48:54,997
We need to stop, we
burned some fuses.

731
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:56,429
Just wait a while.

732
00:48:57,467 --> 00:48:59,128
Here comes, here comes.

733
00:49:02,839 --> 00:49:03,601
Order.

734
00:49:04,141 --> 00:49:06,609
Can we get off
while you repair it?

735
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:08,473
The children would like that.

736
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:09,909
Sure, they can get off.

737
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,570
I'll tell you when.

738
00:49:11,682 --> 00:49:13,517
- Oh.
- Come on, do it in order.

739
00:49:13,517 --> 00:49:15,712
Yeah, huh? Come on.

740
00:49:18,021 --> 00:49:19,579
Everybody out.

741
00:49:20,324 --> 00:49:23,122
Silence please, this
is a delicate scene.

742
00:49:23,226 --> 00:49:25,694
The actors are rehearsing.

743
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:29,024
Please hurry, miss.

744
00:49:32,336 --> 00:49:33,360
What are you looking at, son?

745
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:38,003
Come one, come on, let's go.

746
00:49:47,351 --> 00:49:48,511
Step on it.

747
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,265
Teacher, the
streetcar is leaving.

748
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:06,199
Let's go.

749
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:07,427
Hey.

750
00:50:07,804 --> 00:50:09,066
Wait, wait.

751
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:11,173
They must be just maneuvering.

752
00:50:11,241 --> 00:50:13,877
Silence, please.

753
00:50:13,877 --> 00:50:15,936
We'll film this one.

754
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:35,926
Okay that's enough,
let me drive.

755
00:50:36,166 --> 00:50:37,190
What's going on?

756
00:50:37,267 --> 00:50:38,165
Do you see what I see?

757
00:50:38,235 --> 00:50:40,567
Your sister Lupe with Pablo.

758
00:50:41,071 --> 00:50:41,765
Let me.

759
00:50:56,286 --> 00:50:57,617
Open the door, please.

760
00:50:58,488 --> 00:51:00,046
I said open, can't you hear?

761
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:02,191
Open.

762
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:07,989
I would never have guessed.

763
00:51:08,098 --> 00:51:09,122
How did you find us?

764
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:10,494
That doesn't matter.

765
00:51:10,634 --> 00:51:12,295
I guess you're both happy?

766
00:51:12,436 --> 00:51:13,460
You messed up.

767
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:15,227
Don't get wrapped
up in this.

768
00:51:15,372 --> 00:51:16,498
Especially with strangers.

769
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:17,630
You ingrate.

770
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:19,971
- The watchman wants to tell.
- No way...

771
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:21,976
What are you staring at?

772
00:51:22,112 --> 00:51:25,104
It's your fault, looking
at you makes me angry.

773
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:26,272
Who's denying it?

774
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:28,585
Do you want my brother
to get fired...

775
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:29,643
...or put in jail?

776
00:51:29,719 --> 00:51:30,821
And to thank you
on top of that.

777
00:51:30,821 --> 00:51:33,949
Hey don't even joke
about jail. Dingbat.

778
00:51:34,958 --> 00:51:36,516
Hey, what are you doing?

779
00:51:40,363 --> 00:51:42,331
Don't butt in, you intruder.

780
00:51:42,466 --> 00:51:44,559
Stay there until you rot.

781
00:51:44,634 --> 00:51:46,192
This isn't about you.

782
00:51:48,238 --> 00:51:49,296
Well, anyway.

783
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:51,532
Get back before the noise starts.

784
00:51:51,641 --> 00:51:52,767
I mean now.

785
00:51:52,876 --> 00:51:54,343
Are you going back with him?

786
00:51:54,511 --> 00:51:56,035
- If you'll let me.
- No.

787
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:58,138
No, how dare you?

788
00:51:58,482 --> 00:52:00,006
Open up, I want to get off.

789
00:52:00,217 --> 00:52:02,777
- Open, can't you hear?
- Pipe down.

790
00:52:03,687 --> 00:52:04,483
Stop.

791
00:52:05,222 --> 00:52:06,450
I said stop.

792
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:14,897
Cut them off.

793
00:52:15,031 --> 00:52:17,226
What's wrong?
I don't get it

794
00:52:17,367 --> 00:52:19,631
Don't be an idiot,
cut them off.

795
00:52:19,703 --> 00:52:21,671
I can't understand.

796
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:23,067
You're deaf.

797
00:52:26,676 --> 00:52:30,373
Cut them off, they're
taking me by force.

798
00:52:35,218 --> 00:52:35,877
Oh.

799
00:52:41,458 --> 00:52:43,858
Moron, look what
you did to my car.

800
00:52:51,201 --> 00:52:53,328
See, see what you've done?

801
00:52:53,637 --> 00:52:56,299
They will beat you
up for this.

802
00:52:58,275 --> 00:53:00,038
Now we're really in for it.

803
00:53:00,277 --> 00:53:01,938
- What?
- Look.

804
00:53:06,149 --> 00:53:07,116
It's an inspector.

805
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:08,547
Run him over.

806
00:53:19,729 --> 00:53:21,131
Is this the special
to Xochimilco?

807
00:53:21,131 --> 00:53:21,927
Yes, sir.

808
00:53:22,299 --> 00:53:23,266
So why are there passengers?

809
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:24,626
She's my sister, sir.

810
00:53:24,968 --> 00:53:27,368
- How do you do, miss?
- My pleasure, sir.

811
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:29,097
There are orders for this car...

812
00:53:29,339 --> 00:53:30,931
Take the Niño Perdido route.

813
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:32,736
At San Antonio Abad crossing.

814
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:34,142
Yes, sir.

815
00:53:34,811 --> 00:53:35,971
I'll change the sign.

816
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:38,445
Wait until we reach
the intersection.

817
00:53:38,915 --> 00:53:40,109
Don't mind me.

818
00:53:40,417 --> 00:53:43,147
Whenever you're ready,
I'm going along.

819
00:54:30,066 --> 00:54:32,967
Good luck, and good-bye miss.

820
00:54:33,069 --> 00:54:34,093
Good-bye, sir.

821
00:54:36,406 --> 00:54:37,532
Give me the keys again.

822
00:54:37,807 --> 00:54:39,536
Thanks for helping us.

823
00:54:40,243 --> 00:54:40,709
Me?

824
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:42,869
Sure, you distracted him.

825
00:54:42,979 --> 00:54:45,880
I did it for you,
but that's enough.

826
00:54:46,149 --> 00:54:48,251
I'm leaving, you're on your own.

827
00:54:48,251 --> 00:54:49,149
As you like.

828
00:54:56,926 --> 00:54:58,862
I'm leaving, it's up to you.

829
00:54:58,862 --> 00:54:59,729
Don't go, Lupita.

830
00:54:59,729 --> 00:55:01,196
- What?
- Sit down.

831
00:55:02,666 --> 00:55:03,867
Please, Mr. Julio.

832
00:55:03,867 --> 00:55:05,068
Please, Mr. Arcadio.

833
00:55:05,068 --> 00:55:07,502
No way, I have change.

834
00:55:07,771 --> 00:55:08,260
Thank you.

835
00:55:08,438 --> 00:55:10,406
Don't pay, there's still time.

836
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:10,996
Excuse me?

837
00:55:11,074 --> 00:55:12,564
You can pay upon arrival.

838
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:13,609
Why is that?

839
00:55:13,677 --> 00:55:14,701
It just is, that's all.

840
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:17,279
If you'd rather pay
now, simply don't pay.

841
00:55:17,747 --> 00:55:18,236
No.

842
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:21,576
Never saw anything like it.

843
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:28,291
They're paying, that's stealing.

844
00:55:34,264 --> 00:55:35,356
Hello.

845
00:55:35,465 --> 00:55:37,057
An American, that's
all we needed.

846
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:38,358
Don't pay, miss.

847
00:55:38,468 --> 00:55:40,527
- Why not?
- Because it's free.

848
00:55:41,604 --> 00:55:43,572
Smells like communism to me.

849
00:55:43,773 --> 00:55:44,535
What'd she say?

850
00:55:44,774 --> 00:55:45,866
Communism.

851
00:55:46,076 --> 00:55:47,043
Me pay.

852
00:55:47,143 --> 00:55:48,778
Don't pay, miss.
- Me pay.

853
00:55:48,778 --> 00:55:50,507
Okay, okay, then pay.

854
00:55:50,747 --> 00:55:51,975
What's the matter with you?

855
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:04,425
- See? They're paying.
- Well, tough.

856
00:56:04,627 --> 00:56:05,889
We have to do something.

857
00:56:05,962 --> 00:56:07,327
Get off right here, please.

858
00:56:07,397 --> 00:56:08,887
I don't want you implicated.

859
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:11,432
Now I'm staying to the end.

860
00:56:11,601 --> 00:56:12,795
I'll take whatever comes.

861
00:56:17,173 --> 00:56:18,504
I have no change, sir.

862
00:56:19,142 --> 00:56:21,044
So what am I supposed to do?

863
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:22,568
You can pay tomorrow.

864
00:56:22,645 --> 00:56:23,236
What?

865
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:26,508
Don't worry sir,
I'll pay your fare.

866
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:28,650
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

867
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:30,553
Did you see Mr. Enrique?

868
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:32,077
Such lack of responsibility.

869
00:56:32,355 --> 00:56:34,550
Giving away car fare
as if it were theirs.

870
00:56:34,624 --> 00:56:35,818
Just like that.

871
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:37,651
With everything so expensive.

872
00:56:37,761 --> 00:56:39,353
Sure since it's not theirs.

873
00:56:39,429 --> 00:56:40,225
Like the rest of the country.

874
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:43,623
But salaries are
payable no matter what.

875
00:56:43,767 --> 00:56:45,496
They can strike when they like.

876
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:47,559
That's why anything
labor related...

877
00:56:47,837 --> 00:56:49,429
...is repulsive, I can't stand it.

878
00:56:49,539 --> 00:56:51,871
Some say they'll
rule the earth.

879
00:56:52,142 --> 00:56:54,406
I'd rather die first.

880
00:56:54,778 --> 00:56:56,439
Don't worry, Mr. Arcadio.

881
00:56:56,546 --> 00:56:59,538
That won't be in your time.

882
00:57:03,286 --> 00:57:04,253
Is something wrong?

883
00:57:04,387 --> 00:57:06,150
Nothing, thanks.

884
00:57:15,799 --> 00:57:17,096
Do you feel ill, sir?

885
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:18,666
It's Daddy Pinillos.

886
00:57:19,502 --> 00:57:20,901
The same.

887
00:57:21,204 --> 00:57:24,407
This damned asthma again.

888
00:57:24,407 --> 00:57:26,307
And who are you?

889
00:57:26,376 --> 00:57:28,173
Sir, I am Tarrajas.

890
00:57:28,545 --> 00:57:31,173
Yes, your face is familiar.

891
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:32,745
Are you new here?

892
00:57:32,816 --> 00:57:34,044
I am, in this line.

893
00:57:34,684 --> 00:57:37,954
Are you usurping the
title of driver?

894
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:39,182
Let me explain it to you.

895
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:40,779
Okay? You'll see.

896
00:57:45,428 --> 00:57:47,089
Hey, who's the sour lemon?

897
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:49,999
Daddy Pinillos, a very sneaky guy.

898
00:57:49,999 --> 00:57:51,967
He can get God into trouble
.

899
00:57:52,235 --> 00:57:53,436
What if he's no longer
with the company?

900
00:57:53,436 --> 00:57:54,460
Why not tell him to buzz off?

901
00:57:54,537 --> 00:57:56,334
Do it the friendly way.

902
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:57,098
Alright.

903
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:01,140
Hello, friend.

904
00:58:01,611 --> 00:58:03,010
Hello Daddy Pinillos.

905
00:58:03,413 --> 00:58:04,937
You don't drive well.

906
00:58:05,048 --> 00:58:07,881
You didn't close that
when you drove through.

907
00:58:08,218 --> 00:58:10,652
No matter, there was
hardly any traffic.

908
00:58:10,753 --> 00:58:13,586
Regardless, regulations require it.

909
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:20,493
Train number 830.

910
00:58:30,273 --> 00:58:33,606
Since when do you
have a conductor badge?

911
00:58:34,077 --> 00:58:35,135
Well...

912
00:58:35,311 --> 00:58:36,608
Why are you nervous?

913
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:37,747
Me?

914
00:58:37,747 --> 00:58:40,181
Yes you; you seem scared.

915
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:41,009
Heh, heh, heh.

916
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:43,414
Back to your post so I can drive.

917
00:58:43,486 --> 00:58:45,044
This also has its downs.

918
00:58:45,154 --> 00:58:47,257
Especially for people like you...

919
00:58:47,257 --> 00:58:50,590
...who haven't been
drivers for long.

920
00:59:16,352 --> 00:59:17,580
Can't pull that on me.

921
00:59:17,854 --> 00:59:18,513
All right.

922
00:59:18,922 --> 00:59:21,186
Traffic, Pinillos speaking.

923
00:59:21,958 --> 00:59:23,255
Oh, it's you boss?

924
00:59:23,426 --> 00:59:24,791
Sorry to bother you.

925
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:27,021
But it's really important.

926
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:30,258
Two company guys and a woman.

927
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:33,927
They're driving a streetcar
behind our back.

928
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:37,035
It's number 1 33, sir.

929
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:38,669
1 33?

930
00:59:39,642 --> 00:59:40,666
Just a moment.

931
00:59:42,512 --> 00:59:43,410
Mister Benìtez.

932
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:45,881
Mister Benìtez.

933
00:59:46,883 --> 00:59:49,875
This is serious, he's
calling the company.

934
00:59:49,953 --> 00:59:50,715
Let's go.

935
01:00:11,474 --> 01:00:13,669
I took care of
this yesterday.

936
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:17,404
Number 1 33 was sent
to be dismantled.

937
01:00:17,714 --> 01:00:19,614
It's out of service for good.

938
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:20,942
Thank you Mr. Benìtez.

939
01:00:21,884 --> 01:00:23,853
Pinillos, you're meddling...

940
01:00:23,853 --> 01:00:25,718
...in things where
you shouldn't.

941
01:00:26,055 --> 01:00:28,546
You're no longer an employee.

942
01:00:28,725 --> 01:00:30,393
Your ongoing impertinence...

943
01:00:30,393 --> 01:00:32,258
...is a waste of our time.

944
01:00:33,696 --> 01:00:34,856
Pinillos.

945
01:00:35,264 --> 01:00:37,198
He says a
streetcar was stolen.

946
01:00:37,934 --> 01:00:40,835
I think his age is
affecting his brain.

947
01:00:48,578 --> 01:00:50,068
What is it, "daddy" Pinillos?

948
01:00:50,279 --> 01:00:52,110
Nothing son, nothing.

949
01:00:52,215 --> 01:00:55,275
After dedicating my
life to the company...

950
01:00:55,385 --> 01:00:58,321
...they retired me,
claiming my health...

951
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:00,289
...puts passengers at risk.

952
01:01:00,456 --> 01:01:04,256
And now that I look
after the company...

953
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:06,325
...they say I'm meddlesome.

954
01:01:06,429 --> 01:01:09,232
They'll see I'm
not an old fool.

955
01:01:09,232 --> 01:01:10,400
Bye, Panchito.

956
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:11,594
Please, "daddy" Pinillos.

957
01:01:21,411 --> 01:01:22,639
Where are we going now?

958
01:01:22,745 --> 01:01:24,337
To a closed off street.

959
01:01:24,447 --> 01:01:25,937
It's the only safe way.

960
01:01:26,115 --> 01:01:28,083
Tell them they must get off.

961
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:29,742
And that this car is finished.

962
01:01:29,819 --> 01:01:30,787
I tell them?

963
01:01:30,787 --> 01:01:32,448
If you don't, who will?

964
01:01:32,588 --> 01:01:33,919
You're a bad conductor.

965
01:01:34,057 --> 01:01:36,184
I never spoke in public before.

966
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:37,326
Go on.

967
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:38,925
Hey.

968
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:40,655
Well, now what?

969
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:41,526
- What?
- Don't get nervous.

970
01:01:41,731 --> 01:01:43,494
- Relax.
- Don't get nervous?

971
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:45,835
Ladies and gents, everyone off.

972
01:01:45,835 --> 01:01:46,995
No, young man.

973
01:01:47,136 --> 01:01:48,763
It's beyond our control.

974
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:50,266
Let's go to the depot.

975
01:01:50,473 --> 01:01:52,875
And as you know, at the depot...

976
01:01:52,875 --> 01:01:54,342
...they'll have to help us.

977
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:57,805
They can't just ignore
the public interest.

978
01:01:58,081 --> 01:01:59,548
- I won't get off.
- Nor l.

979
01:01:59,682 --> 01:02:00,842
This is impossible.

980
01:02:00,917 --> 01:02:02,285
Same old thing.

981
01:02:02,285 --> 01:02:03,081
Calm down now.

982
01:02:04,487 --> 01:02:06,478
There's another car behind us.

983
01:02:06,656 --> 01:02:08,487
Wait at the intersection.

984
01:02:08,591 --> 01:02:10,752
Who will replace our down time?

985
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:17,233
It's not our fault.

986
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:19,428
- Nothing we can do.
- Step off now.

987
01:02:21,370 --> 01:02:24,430
I told you we shouldn't
take a streetcar!

988
01:02:24,507 --> 01:02:27,442
- Will it be a long wait?
- I don't know, ma'am.

989
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:51,290
What happened?

990
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:56,973
Come on, talk.

991
01:02:56,973 --> 01:02:57,940
Wait.

992
01:02:59,008 --> 01:03:00,243
Nothing so far.

993
01:03:00,243 --> 01:03:02,438
- I spoke to the watchman.
- And?

994
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:05,743
He's more scared than you are.

995
01:03:06,048 --> 01:03:07,515
So he hasn't told yet.

996
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:08,708
Not a word.

997
01:03:09,185 --> 01:03:10,550
The company knows nothing.

998
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:12,383
But old Pinillos telephoned.

999
01:03:12,522 --> 01:03:14,888
Maybe, but all is calm there.

1000
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:17,517
Are we just going
to stay here?

1001
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:18,920
We're safe here.

1002
01:03:19,328 --> 01:03:21,796
When the watchman arrives
we'll be at work.

1003
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:23,557
No problem.

1004
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:43,818
Hi, "daddy" Pinillos.
What is it?

1005
01:03:44,287 --> 01:03:46,915
Something of interest
for the company.

1006
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:50,288
Have you seen 1 33
pass through here?

1007
01:03:50,893 --> 01:03:51,951
I don't think so.

1008
01:03:52,795 --> 01:03:54,319
No, it hasn't. What' up?

1009
01:03:54,397 --> 01:03:56,766
Something incredible.

1010
01:03:56,766 --> 01:04:00,497
That car is
operating irregularly.

1011
01:04:00,603 --> 01:04:03,731
I have to find it.

1012
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:05,532
An irregular streetcar.

1013
01:04:05,708 --> 01:04:06,436
What's that?

1014
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:07,840
None of your business.

1015
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:09,502
And the terminals?

1016
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:11,738
No, it won't go there.

1017
01:04:11,881 --> 01:04:14,042
There are dispatchers there.

1018
01:04:14,116 --> 01:04:15,640
Might be switching tracks.

1019
01:04:15,785 --> 01:04:17,980
I have to find it.

1020
01:04:18,087 --> 01:04:21,454
I have to find it. See you.

1021
01:04:21,757 --> 01:04:22,985
Okay, good luck.

1022
01:05:44,674 --> 01:05:46,574
- What are you doing?
- What Lupita?

1023
01:05:46,809 --> 01:05:49,178
- Me?
- Watch those hands.

1024
01:05:49,178 --> 01:05:51,738
- Abusive.
- Don't offend me.

1025
01:05:52,081 --> 01:05:53,742
I'll tell your brother.

1026
01:05:53,883 --> 01:05:56,113
So, you'll talk to my brother.

1027
01:05:56,252 --> 01:05:57,913
Why, you coward?

1028
01:05:58,087 --> 01:05:59,418
I'm not made of stone.

1029
01:05:59,488 --> 01:06:02,013
If you think that,
I can't face him.

1030
01:06:02,124 --> 01:06:04,888
If I break his trust, it's over.

1031
01:06:05,194 --> 01:06:07,219
Curls, you're exaggerating.

1032
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:10,493
It's just that me being a woman...

1033
01:06:10,599 --> 01:06:11,657
I'm sorry Lupita.

1034
01:06:12,168 --> 01:06:13,601
Where are you going?

1035
01:06:13,736 --> 01:06:17,001
- But I thought...
- Sit here with me.

1036
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:18,602
You're not mad?

1037
01:06:18,674 --> 01:06:20,266
I wasn't angry.

1038
01:06:20,476 --> 01:06:21,544
Just nervous...

1039
01:06:21,544 --> 01:06:23,512
...about what might happen.

1040
01:06:23,846 --> 01:06:25,973
Lupe, Lupita.

1041
01:06:27,516 --> 01:06:29,006
I'm sorry.

1042
01:06:29,552 --> 01:06:30,746
- Light, anyone?
- Here.

1043
01:06:30,853 --> 01:06:32,115
- No.
- No.

1044
01:06:32,254 --> 01:06:33,016
Okay then.

1045
01:06:49,472 --> 01:06:50,530
Evening, boss.

1046
01:06:50,806 --> 01:06:52,671
Let's unload. Why's that there?

1047
01:06:52,775 --> 01:06:54,766
It's been there for hours.

1048
01:06:55,144 --> 01:06:56,236
Bad stuff.

1049
01:06:56,479 --> 01:06:58,777
I think we're being tricked.

1050
01:06:58,881 --> 01:07:00,178
Unload anyway.

1051
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:02,440
Start, boys.

1052
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:05,119
Do you have a light?

1053
01:07:05,187 --> 01:07:07,655
I'm out and can't find one.

1054
01:07:08,257 --> 01:07:10,919
Strange for it to be here, huh?

1055
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:13,120
This track is not in use.

1056
01:07:13,262 --> 01:07:15,531
Oh. We're just waiting.

1057
01:07:15,531 --> 01:07:16,555
For what?

1058
01:07:16,665 --> 01:07:19,065
Actually, we're taking
a little break.

1059
01:07:19,168 --> 01:07:21,771
Work can get you tired at times.

1060
01:07:21,771 --> 01:07:23,136
Thanks for the light.

1061
01:07:23,272 --> 01:07:26,139
Hold up pal, what's the hurry?

1062
01:07:26,242 --> 01:07:28,403
Weren't you taking a break?

1063
01:07:28,511 --> 01:07:30,809
Don't leave, let's party.

1064
01:07:30,913 --> 01:07:32,471
Really? Hey, thanks.

1065
01:07:32,848 --> 01:07:34,372
Big load, huh?

1066
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:36,418
They must be heavy hitters.

1067
01:07:37,286 --> 01:07:38,621
What's in the cargo?

1068
01:07:38,621 --> 01:07:41,522
Can't you read? What's it say?

1069
01:07:44,627 --> 01:07:46,185
Oh, I hadn't noticed.

1070
01:07:46,328 --> 01:07:48,387
- Well, thanks.
- Careful.

1071
01:07:50,266 --> 01:07:51,324
It's corn.

1072
01:07:55,638 --> 01:07:57,139
Go on in, buddy.

1073
01:07:57,139 --> 01:07:59,198
Let's talk in private.

1074
01:07:59,275 --> 01:08:02,301
- But I have to go.
- I said go in.

1075
01:08:03,145 --> 01:08:04,612
Pick it up.

1076
01:08:11,554 --> 01:08:13,579
Go ahead, friend.

1077
01:08:20,129 --> 01:08:22,324
Hey, not so fast, buddy.

1078
01:08:22,565 --> 01:08:24,396
Trying to pull a fast one?

1079
01:08:24,467 --> 01:08:25,568
How so, sir?

1080
01:08:25,568 --> 01:08:27,695
Come on, don't pretend.

1081
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:30,330
He thinks we're as stupid as he is.

1082
01:08:30,573 --> 01:08:33,371
- What?
- I've no time to argue.

1083
01:08:33,642 --> 01:08:36,245
- There's two of you right?
- Right.

1084
01:08:36,245 --> 01:08:38,907
How shall we resolve this?

1085
01:08:39,081 --> 01:08:41,242
As friends or not?

1086
01:08:41,417 --> 01:08:44,045
Definitely as friends.

1087
01:08:44,186 --> 01:08:46,989
- Hey, let go.
- Leave that corn.

1088
01:08:46,989 --> 01:08:49,514
- Let go.
- You think it's for free?

1089
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:53,460
You looking for a fight?

1090
01:09:04,707 --> 01:09:07,576
You want to fight, creep?

1091
01:09:07,576 --> 01:09:10,340
Why are you getting in there?

1092
01:09:11,413 --> 01:09:12,175
Let her go.

1093
01:09:14,583 --> 01:09:17,484
Get out of here, go on, beat it.

1094
01:09:18,254 --> 01:09:19,721
Don't push me.

1095
01:09:30,232 --> 01:09:32,928
Run, the cops'll be here soon.

1096
01:09:56,458 --> 01:09:57,823
Bad luck.

1097
01:09:58,060 --> 01:09:59,562
Things were going well.

1098
01:09:59,562 --> 01:10:00,995
Where to now?

1099
01:10:01,130 --> 01:10:03,792
I'm tired of being on the move.

1100
01:10:03,899 --> 01:10:05,127
You think I like it?

1101
01:10:05,267 --> 01:10:06,996
We can't go on like this.

1102
01:10:07,636 --> 01:10:09,536
Seven o'clock is not far.

1103
01:10:09,705 --> 01:10:11,273
Half an hour isn't bad.

1104
01:10:11,273 --> 01:10:13,639
The fuzz is after us.

1105
01:10:13,742 --> 01:10:15,177
We're done for.

1106
01:10:15,177 --> 01:10:16,542
Let's make it count.

1107
01:10:16,679 --> 01:10:17,771
Come on.

1108
01:10:49,445 --> 01:10:52,448
So you thought you'd
get rid of me?

1109
01:10:52,448 --> 01:10:53,676
You're in for it.

1110
01:10:53,782 --> 01:10:55,684
No need to be angry.

1111
01:10:55,684 --> 01:10:56,810
No need?

1112
01:10:56,919 --> 01:10:58,944
Who said you could take it?

1113
01:10:59,154 --> 01:11:00,052
It was stolen.

1114
01:11:00,155 --> 01:11:02,558
We're getting tired
of you, old man.

1115
01:11:02,558 --> 01:11:04,458
You're not an employee.

1116
01:11:04,627 --> 01:11:06,652
You're just making trouble.

1117
01:11:06,795 --> 01:11:08,353
Holy Virgin of Guadalupe.

1118
01:11:08,497 --> 01:11:10,099
Boys, don't be dumb.

1119
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:11,589
Respect his white hair.

1120
01:11:11,667 --> 01:11:13,736
His white hair.

1121
01:11:13,736 --> 01:11:16,034
I can handle this pair.

1122
01:11:16,138 --> 01:11:17,230
You gangsters.

1123
01:11:17,406 --> 01:11:18,498
Gangsters?

1124
01:11:18,641 --> 01:11:20,871
Enough already, do it for me.

1125
01:11:20,943 --> 01:11:22,205
Cowards.

1126
01:11:22,845 --> 01:11:24,540
Thank the lady.

1127
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:26,773
Take the car.

1128
01:11:26,882 --> 01:11:29,009
But no more arguing.

1129
01:11:29,251 --> 01:11:31,276
I'll take it, son.

1130
01:11:31,353 --> 01:11:33,188
With us inside.

1131
01:11:33,188 --> 01:11:34,621
There's no stolen train.

1132
01:11:34,723 --> 01:11:37,624
You'll pay dearly for this.

1133
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:39,887
We're going to the company.

1134
01:11:42,965 --> 01:11:44,592
For the love of the Lord.

1135
01:11:44,667 --> 01:11:45,861
Are you okay?

1136
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:49,426
See, "daddy" Pinillos?
Come on over here.

1137
01:11:49,505 --> 01:11:51,905
It's okay, it's okay.

1138
01:11:52,541 --> 01:11:53,609
Let go.

1139
01:11:53,609 --> 01:11:55,907
Somebody drive.

1140
01:11:56,145 --> 01:11:58,375
But straight to the depot.

1141
01:11:58,447 --> 01:11:59,937
Please help me.

1142
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:08,155
What'll the company do for you?

1143
01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:10,850
All the guys will
single you out.

1144
01:12:11,126 --> 01:12:12,150
For being a snitch.

1145
01:12:12,961 --> 01:12:14,861
Come on, please.

1146
01:12:15,030 --> 01:12:16,565
Stop begging him.

1147
01:12:16,565 --> 01:12:19,466
Looks like his mind is made up.

1148
01:12:20,502 --> 01:12:23,403
Then let's let things
take their course.

1149
01:12:23,472 --> 01:12:24,803
Don't worry.

1150
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:27,237
I took it, I'm to blame.

1151
01:12:27,743 --> 01:12:28,711
Are you nuts?

1152
01:12:28,711 --> 01:12:30,872
Think I'll let you take the rap?

1153
01:12:30,946 --> 01:12:32,607
We both did it.

1154
01:12:32,915 --> 01:12:35,042
Stop and open the door.

1155
01:12:35,384 --> 01:12:37,852
Sorry gramps, this is our stop.

1156
01:12:37,953 --> 01:12:41,590
I drove streetcars
before you were born.

1157
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:43,182
- Bums.
- A century ago.

1158
01:12:43,292 --> 01:12:45,260
We can carry you if need be.

1159
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:48,731
Thought you could beat an old man?

1160
01:12:48,731 --> 01:12:50,460
Straight to the compa...

1161
01:13:00,476 --> 01:13:03,570
Pinillos, don't do this.

1162
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:13,412
- He's cold.
- Are you sure?

1163
01:13:14,823 --> 01:13:17,155
God, what do we do now?

1164
01:13:30,506 --> 01:13:31,632
Hey, come here.

1165
01:13:33,776 --> 01:13:36,244
- What is it?
- He's hurt.

1166
01:13:41,917 --> 01:13:42,747
What's going on?

1167
01:13:43,185 --> 01:13:45,653
This passenger got ill.

1168
01:13:45,788 --> 01:13:48,313
He got ill, or did you make him?

1169
01:13:49,057 --> 01:13:49,751
Let's see.

1170
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:51,116
Any contusions?

1171
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:52,995
When I saw him I felt...

1172
01:13:52,995 --> 01:13:55,896
...something bad would
happen to him.

1173
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:58,200
- He was pale.
- As a sheet.

1174
01:13:58,200 --> 01:13:59,428
Still breathing.

1175
01:13:59,835 --> 01:14:01,462
To the drugstore.

1176
01:14:01,537 --> 01:14:03,562
He needs a doctor.

1177
01:14:03,672 --> 01:14:04,661
Hold on.

1178
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:06,671
You wait here.

1179
01:14:06,775 --> 01:14:08,174
And what if a car comes?

1180
01:14:08,243 --> 01:14:09,267
Let them wait.

1181
01:14:16,285 --> 01:14:19,345
Curls, what if the old man dies?

1182
01:14:19,655 --> 01:14:20,952
It's up to God.

1183
01:14:21,323 --> 01:14:22,756
We didn't kill him.

1184
01:14:22,825 --> 01:14:23,985
But, what if?

1185
01:14:24,126 --> 01:14:26,219
While they investigate.

1186
01:14:32,534 --> 01:14:33,626
What happened?

1187
01:14:33,769 --> 01:14:35,031
Streetcar accident.

1188
01:14:35,170 --> 01:14:36,194
Let's see.

1189
01:14:37,473 --> 01:14:38,599
Do we have to pay?

1190
01:14:38,707 --> 01:14:40,698
- Any family with him?
- None.

1191
01:14:40,943 --> 01:14:43,844
He's alone, maybe just fainted.

1192
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,548
Let's see what we can do.

1193
01:14:46,548 --> 01:14:49,278
I'll call the Red Cross.

1194
01:14:54,523 --> 01:14:56,718
I don't think you need to.

1195
01:14:57,059 --> 01:14:58,993
I'll try to revive him.

1196
01:14:59,428 --> 01:15:02,454
He'll react to this right away.

1197
01:15:34,029 --> 01:15:35,860
Hey, look.

1198
01:15:41,069 --> 01:15:43,401
Must be in a hurry.

1199
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:44,870
If he can run...

1200
01:15:45,007 --> 01:15:46,872
...we're out of here.

1201
01:15:51,079 --> 01:15:53,445
Thank God he's okay.

1202
01:15:53,582 --> 01:15:56,176
We thought he was a goner.

1203
01:15:56,318 --> 01:15:59,776
"Daddy" Pinillos will bury us all.

1204
01:16:00,022 --> 01:16:01,723
Shall I see you home?

1205
01:16:01,723 --> 01:16:04,283
No, leave me, go away.

1206
01:16:04,526 --> 01:16:07,051
I'm warning you as gentlemen.

1207
01:16:07,262 --> 01:16:11,062
This isn't over yet, you'll see.

1208
01:16:12,668 --> 01:16:13,430
Taxi.

1209
01:16:14,136 --> 01:16:15,000
Taxi.

1210
01:16:19,675 --> 01:16:22,473
The streetcar depot in lndianilla.

1211
01:16:39,361 --> 01:16:40,328
Here you are, sir.

1212
01:16:41,029 --> 01:16:41,825
Okay.

1213
01:16:42,297 --> 01:16:44,766
Mr. Pinillos has
waited a long time.

1214
01:16:44,766 --> 01:16:46,529
Let him wait or leave.

1215
01:16:58,647 --> 01:17:00,444
- Hold on.
- Thanks.

1216
01:17:05,487 --> 01:17:07,556
- Good bye Mr. Manuel.
- Good bye.

1217
01:17:07,556 --> 01:17:09,524
The meeting is over at one.

1218
01:17:09,591 --> 01:17:11,786
- Hope to see you.
- I'll be there.

1219
01:17:12,394 --> 01:17:13,418
Mr. Manuel.

1220
01:17:14,429 --> 01:17:15,555
Pinillos.

1221
01:17:15,697 --> 01:17:16,994
I forgot about you.

1222
01:17:17,065 --> 01:17:19,090
Forgive my insistence.

1223
01:17:19,234 --> 01:17:21,236
This is a grave matter.

1224
01:17:21,236 --> 01:17:23,761
Can it wait until tomorrow?

1225
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:25,932
It must be now, sir.

1226
01:17:26,541 --> 01:17:28,168
A streetcar was stolen.

1227
01:17:28,710 --> 01:17:29,642
You don't say!

1228
01:17:29,778 --> 01:17:33,214
I do say, and I have the details.

1229
01:17:33,749 --> 01:17:36,445
- Come in.
- After you, Mr. Manuel.

1230
01:17:41,957 --> 01:17:42,719
Did you hear?

1231
01:17:42,891 --> 01:17:45,951
He's nuts, how can that happen?

1232
01:17:46,061 --> 01:17:48,120
- He said it.
- Wait.

1233
01:17:48,830 --> 01:17:50,465
Can our company...

1234
01:17:50,465 --> 01:17:52,057
...be so easily fooled?

1235
01:17:52,167 --> 01:17:55,000
No sir, but I was
on that streetcar.

1236
01:17:55,137 --> 01:17:56,798
And the crooks confessed.

1237
01:17:56,905 --> 01:17:58,805
This is absurd.

1238
01:18:02,811 --> 01:18:04,642
I mean no harm.

1239
01:18:04,746 --> 01:18:06,941
I'm protecting the company.

1240
01:18:07,015 --> 01:18:08,850
I swear this is all true.

1241
01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:10,252
To make you stop this...

1242
01:18:10,252 --> 01:18:12,846
...I'll show you
we make no mistakes.

1243
01:18:13,055 --> 01:18:13,987
Come along.

1244
01:18:14,122 --> 01:18:17,250
You'll see that 1 1 3
is in its place.

1245
01:18:34,342 --> 01:18:36,945
You did say 1 1 3, right?

1246
01:18:36,945 --> 01:18:40,437
Yes sir, exactly: 1 1 3.

1247
01:18:40,649 --> 01:18:43,174
- There you have it.
- Huh?

1248
01:18:54,362 --> 01:18:55,590
What do you say?

1249
01:18:55,764 --> 01:18:58,433
They must've just brought it.

1250
01:18:58,433 --> 01:19:00,367
These are the crooks.

1251
01:19:00,435 --> 01:19:01,527
May I help you, sir?

1252
01:19:01,636 --> 01:19:02,830
Glad you're here.

1253
01:19:02,971 --> 01:19:04,529
Has it left today?

1254
01:19:04,706 --> 01:19:06,975
No, it hasn't moved from here.

1255
01:19:06,975 --> 01:19:09,911
Do you think we'd dare to...

1256
01:19:09,911 --> 01:19:12,379
And the company's so organized.

1257
01:19:12,514 --> 01:19:14,616
How can a car leave unknown?

1258
01:19:14,616 --> 01:19:15,640
I totally agree.

1259
01:19:15,717 --> 01:19:17,275
You agree, sir?

1260
01:19:17,352 --> 01:19:18,148
Don't you?

1261
01:19:18,253 --> 01:19:20,118
- No sir.
- Look, Pinillos.

1262
01:19:20,222 --> 01:19:23,325
A streetcar cannot be stolen.

1263
01:19:23,325 --> 01:19:25,093
They travel on rails...

1264
01:19:25,093 --> 01:19:26,583
...belonging to the company.

1265
01:19:26,828 --> 01:19:29,598
Stealing means taking away.

1266
01:19:29,598 --> 01:19:31,828
But I know they took it.

1267
01:19:31,933 --> 01:19:33,867
Excuse me, Pinillos.

1268
01:19:34,035 --> 01:19:36,438
Who knows more than Management?

1269
01:19:36,438 --> 01:19:39,168
But we appreciate your interest.

1270
01:19:39,274 --> 01:19:42,243
Stop by the cashier tomorrow.

1271
01:19:42,377 --> 01:19:44,072
Good night, Pinillos.

1272
01:19:46,648 --> 01:19:47,615
Mr. Manager, sir.

1273
01:19:47,749 --> 01:19:51,014
I'm not looking for a handout.

1274
01:19:51,153 --> 01:19:53,144
But now everyone, from...

1275
01:19:53,421 --> 01:19:55,946
...managers down to employees...

1276
01:19:56,024 --> 01:19:58,618
...watchmen and workers all hide...

1277
01:19:58,794 --> 01:20:01,129
...their tracks and incompetence.

1278
01:20:01,129 --> 01:20:02,687
Not another word, sir.

1279
01:20:02,764 --> 01:20:04,099
You don't want it known.

1280
01:20:04,099 --> 01:20:07,035
You've no right to meddle
in the company.

1281
01:20:07,035 --> 01:20:08,764
You're not an employee.

1282
01:20:08,870 --> 01:20:11,202
But you do receive a pension.

1283
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:12,808
A pension.

1284
01:20:12,808 --> 01:20:15,743
I will not allow your insults.

1285
01:20:15,977 --> 01:20:16,534
Braulio.

1286
01:20:16,845 --> 01:20:19,040
- Sir.
- Escort him please.

1287
01:20:56,651 --> 01:20:58,118
This was the story.

1288
01:20:58,753 --> 01:21:00,584
For some, uneventful.

1289
01:21:00,822 --> 01:21:02,517
Ignored by the majority,

1290
01:21:02,691 --> 01:21:05,057
but memorable to its stars

1291
01:21:05,193 --> 01:21:09,220
who return to the simple
rhythm of their lives

1292
01:21:09,431 --> 01:21:12,594
as their steps fade
into the streets.

1293
01:21:12,667 --> 01:21:14,601
They have so often walked

1294
01:21:14,769 --> 01:21:15,963
ever deeper

1295
01:21:16,104 --> 01:21:19,972
into their still unknown future.

1296
01:21:20,842 --> 01:21:21,831
Meanwhile,

1297
01:21:22,043 --> 01:21:24,568
the city continues to
spawn and create

1298
01:21:24,813 --> 01:21:28,544
thousands of different stories.
