A WOMAN WITHOUT LOVE

3
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,320
CARLOS MONTERO
ANTIQUES OF ALL SORTS

4
00:01:51,488 --> 00:01:53,198
Here it is.

5
00:01:53,199 --> 00:01:55,573
It's a painting on a steel sheet.

6
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:57,282
From the beginning
ofthe 19th Century.

7
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,741
It's dated. Look.

8
00:01:58,742 --> 00:02:00,835
The date doesn't mean
anything, Ma'am.

9
00:02:04,536 --> 00:02:07,536
Yes. Montero Antique Store.

10
00:02:08,287 --> 00:02:09,869
Yes? It's me.

11
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,495
There are many forgeries
in this business.

12
00:02:12,496 --> 00:02:15,080
This seems to be from
the beginning of this century.

13
00:02:15,081 --> 00:02:18,081
You are completely mistaken,
it's authentic.

14
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:21,083
What? Yes, yes, principal.

15
00:02:21,667 --> 00:02:24,542
It's unbelievable.

16
00:02:24,543 --> 00:02:27,543
I assure you that the little rogue
will be punished accordingly.

17
00:02:27,876 --> 00:02:30,876
Yes, yes, Sir.
Good afternoon, principal.

18
00:02:32,253 --> 00:02:34,628
It's 300 pesos, if you want it.

19
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:36,254
The most I would give you is $80.

20
00:02:36,255 --> 00:02:37,713
No, that's impossible.

21
00:02:37,714 --> 00:02:40,171
-Well, let's say $95.
-I'll handle this.

22
00:02:40,172 --> 00:02:43,172
-The gentleman was offering me...
-Leave. Now.

23
00:02:44,132 --> 00:02:46,299
As an expert, you will agree with me.

24
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,300
You are mistaken.
Besides, this picture is not for sale.

25
00:02:50,552 --> 00:02:52,093
But the lady was asking me...

26
00:02:52,094 --> 00:02:54,260
Here we sell, sir.
We don't steal.

27
00:02:54,261 --> 00:02:56,760
Go to the flea market where
it's more expensive than the stores...

28
00:02:56,761 --> 00:02:59,012
thanks to customers like you.

29
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:01,304
Come on, man.

30
00:03:01,305 --> 00:03:04,305
With such a temper you'll have
very few customers, my friend.

31
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,932
What a stupid fool.

32
00:03:09,933 --> 00:03:12,016
Why do you even
argue with those people?

33
00:03:12,017 --> 00:03:13,559
But, Carlos. He was a customer.

34
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,267
A customer buys,
he doesn't bargain.

35
00:03:15,268 --> 00:03:16,852
Carlos, please.

36
00:03:16,853 --> 00:03:19,769
That telephone call upset you, right?

37
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,895
Remember, getting upset
is harmful for you.

38
00:03:21,896 --> 00:03:23,269
And who gets me upset?

39
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,855
If it's not you, it's my son.

40
00:03:24,856 --> 00:03:27,856
And when it's not my son, it's you.

41
00:03:30,148 --> 00:03:33,065
So it must have been
the school, right?

42
00:03:33,066 --> 00:03:35,358
Something happened to Carlitos?
Tell me.

43
00:03:35,359 --> 00:03:37,484
If you didn't spoil him so much,

44
00:03:37,485 --> 00:03:40,485
if you didn't always sidewith him
this wouldn't have happened.

45
00:03:41,237 --> 00:03:43,444
For God's sake, what happened?

46
00:03:43,445 --> 00:03:46,445
Simply, that at his age he has
the instincts of a thief...

47
00:03:46,738 --> 00:03:48,863
and doesn't respect his teacher.

48
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:51,864
Are you still going to defend him?
That's all I need.

49
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:56,282
How embarrassing!

50
00:03:56,283 --> 00:03:59,283
My son a thief!

51
00:03:59,326 --> 00:04:01,575
I won't accuse him
without seeing him first.

52
00:04:01,576 --> 00:04:03,909
He's at a difficult age
but he is a good kid.

53
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,284
I'll speak to him
and you'll see...

54
00:04:05,285 --> 00:04:08,285
Yes! And you will cover up
for him as usual,

55
00:04:08,286 --> 00:04:11,286
because all you care about
is getting your own way.

56
00:04:11,455 --> 00:04:14,330
There is no other authority here
but yours, CarIos.

57
00:04:14,331 --> 00:04:17,331
Since we got married I've had
to give up all my pleasures,

58
00:04:17,832 --> 00:04:20,832
all my desires, all my opinions.

59
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:22,875
But now we are dealing
with Carlitos.

60
00:04:22,876 --> 00:04:25,541
So you have sacrificed
yourself, right?

61
00:04:25,542 --> 00:04:28,542
Before we got married it seemed
that I was always right...

62
00:04:28,544 --> 00:04:30,418
and you treated me
with great respect.

63
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:33,419
But, of course, that was before.
In order to get out of your misery.

64
00:04:33,588 --> 00:04:36,588
To get your parents out of that
rotten neighborhood they lived in.

65
00:04:38,047 --> 00:04:41,047
I've kept my part of the bargain.
Do you lack anything?

66
00:04:42,132 --> 00:04:45,132
You have been good to me.
If you wish, treat me as a maid,

67
00:04:46,092 --> 00:04:49,092
but don't be unfair to your son.

68
00:04:50,094 --> 00:04:53,094
Come here, Carlos.

69
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:58,762
Today you have tarnished your
father's name with shame.

70
00:04:58,971 --> 00:05:01,763
Because your father
is an honest man, understand?

71
00:05:01,764 --> 00:05:04,139
I didn't steal anything, father.
The teacher...

72
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,430
Shut up! Don't talk back to me!

73
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,431
You should listen to him.
And believe him if he tells the truth.

74
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,432
In the meantime, go to your room.

75
00:05:11,433 --> 00:05:14,433
You will not come out or eat
until you tell me the truth.

76
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:18,310
-I don't want sons that lie or steal.
-It's not true! I'm not a thief!

77
00:05:22,104 --> 00:05:25,104
That will teach you not to talk
back to your father!

78
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:28,439
-Come with me.
-Carlos, pIease.

79
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:34,775
When you grow up you'll say:
My father slapped me...

80
00:05:34,776 --> 00:05:37,776
to always remind me that I should
not steal nor disobey!

81
00:05:38,152 --> 00:05:41,152
Come on!

82
00:05:43,945 --> 00:05:46,445
Get in there.

83
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:49,363
Isolation and hunger
are the best remedies for rebels.

84
00:05:49,364 --> 00:05:52,281
If it was used more often
there would be fewer revolutionaries.

85
00:05:52,282 --> 00:05:55,282
You have to learn
to behave like my son.

86
00:06:05,702 --> 00:06:08,702
No, thank you.

87
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,912
You're not going to eat?

88
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:12,663
I'm not hungry.

89
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:15,664
It's your loss because
the tamales are delicious.

90
00:06:15,998 --> 00:06:18,415
-Come on, eat one.
-I told you I didn't want any.

91
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:21,416
Come on.

92
00:06:22,584 --> 00:06:25,584
What's the matter?
Every day the same thing.

93
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:28,460
Long faces, sighs,
ignoring the food.

94
00:06:28,461 --> 00:06:31,420
Do you think it's free?

95
00:06:31,421 --> 00:06:33,628
Look, if you're going to continue
sulking like this, leave the table,

96
00:06:33,629 --> 00:06:36,629
because seeing you like this
makes me lose my appetite.

97
00:06:48,801 --> 00:06:51,801
Carlitos, son,
are you already asleep?

98
00:06:52,552 --> 00:06:54,552
Listen, I do believe you.

99
00:06:54,553 --> 00:06:57,553
I know you are good,
that you never lie.

100
00:07:29,691 --> 00:07:31,856
Carlitos!

101
00:07:31,857 --> 00:07:34,149
My son...

102
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:37,150
Where are you, my boy?

103
00:07:46,447 --> 00:07:49,447
He ran away.

104
00:07:57,658 --> 00:08:00,658
Carlitos is not in the room
you locked him in.

105
00:08:01,077 --> 00:08:03,451
-What are you saying?
-The boy has ran away, Carlos.

106
00:08:03,452 --> 00:08:06,452
If anything should happen to him
it will be your fault.

107
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,495
He ran away? Impossible!

108
00:08:10,496 --> 00:08:13,121
How could he have ran away
if I locked him in?

109
00:08:13,122 --> 00:08:15,539
That doesn't matter now.
We must do something immediately.

110
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,706
Come on, Chole, perhaps
we'll catch him down the street.

111
00:08:17,707 --> 00:08:20,707
Where are you going? Calm down.
He couldn't have gone far.

112
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,834
I'll catch up to you.
I'm going to call the police.

113
00:08:26,752 --> 00:08:29,752
Oh, children! Children!

114
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:57,178
Man, that's strange.

115
00:08:57,179 --> 00:09:00,179
-What happened, Gonzalez?
-Look, boss.

116
00:09:07,141 --> 00:09:08,975
I thought it was something more.

117
00:09:08,976 --> 00:09:10,891
Since when is it strange
to see a boy?

118
00:09:10,892 --> 00:09:12,684
This boy is not from here, sir.

119
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:15,685
Let's see.

120
00:09:16,353 --> 00:09:18,728
You are right.

121
00:09:18,729 --> 00:09:21,729
He is... no.
Yes, he's crying.

122
00:09:22,063 --> 00:09:24,438
He may be lost.

123
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:27,439
-Let's go and see.
-Come on, sir.

124
00:09:44,321 --> 00:09:47,321
Don't run, boy.
We won't harm you.

125
00:09:47,614 --> 00:09:50,072
Are you staying here
or just visiting?

126
00:09:50,073 --> 00:09:53,073
Stay still. Don't be afraid.
I'm your friend.

127
00:09:54,574 --> 00:09:56,824
Get back to work,
I'll catch up with you later.

128
00:09:56,825 --> 00:09:59,825
Look, you will sit here with me
and tell me your name.

129
00:10:02,244 --> 00:10:05,244
What, you won't tell me?

130
00:10:05,453 --> 00:10:08,453
Then you are Don Juan
without a tongue.

131
00:10:08,662 --> 00:10:11,537
Look, if you become my friend,
I'll take you to a river...

132
00:10:11,538 --> 00:10:14,538
where you will find
the biggest trout in the world.

133
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:17,749
Would you like to catch one,
Juanito?

134
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,332
But I don't know how to fish.

135
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:22,083
No big deal. I'll teach you.

136
00:10:22,084 --> 00:10:25,084
-Right now?
-Right now, my friend.

137
00:10:26,628 --> 00:10:28,918
So we're already friends,
right, Juanito?

138
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,543
My name is not Juanito.

139
00:10:30,544 --> 00:10:33,544
My name is
Carlitos Montero Jimenez.

140
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:37,047
So you have a name.
How did you get here?

141
00:10:37,048 --> 00:10:40,048
-On a truck.
-Okay, Carlitos.

142
00:10:40,883 --> 00:10:43,883
You'll now tell your friend Julio,
because my name is Julio,

143
00:10:45,384 --> 00:10:48,384
why you ran away from home.

144
00:11:15,311 --> 00:11:17,685
Well, at least here it doesn't
say anything.

145
00:11:17,686 --> 00:11:19,686
The press doesn't say anything.

146
00:11:19,687 --> 00:11:22,229
Anyway,
the police has been alerted...

147
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,312
and all we can do is wait.

148
00:11:24,313 --> 00:11:27,231
Thank you for your concern.
I'll tell him.

149
00:11:27,232 --> 00:11:29,106
Excuse me, miss.
I would like to speak to the owner.

150
00:11:29,107 --> 00:11:31,566
My husband has not arrived.
Come back later.

151
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:34,066
Then you are the owner?

152
00:11:34,067 --> 00:11:36,901
You're so young.
I wouldn't have believed it.

153
00:11:36,902 --> 00:11:38,235
Well, Ma'am.

154
00:11:38,236 --> 00:11:41,236
I'm sure you'll love to have
the piece of art I brought you.

155
00:11:41,654 --> 00:11:44,278
I'm sorry, but I can't take care
of that right now.

156
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:47,279
Wait a moment.

157
00:11:54,575 --> 00:11:57,575
My son!

158
00:11:58,076 --> 00:12:00,409
You're fine! Are you alright?

159
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:03,410
Why did you go away? Where?

160
00:12:04,037 --> 00:12:06,870
I bet you haven't eaten anything
since last night, right?

161
00:12:06,871 --> 00:12:09,871
Yes I did, mother. I had breakfast
with my friend Julio.

162
00:12:10,747 --> 00:12:13,747
Excuse me, but I'm so excited
that I haven't even thanked you.

163
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:17,416
It doesn't matter.

164
00:12:17,417 --> 00:12:19,666
You don't know how I've suffered
these past days...

165
00:12:19,667 --> 00:12:22,667
and when I was most desperate,
you show up with my son.

166
00:12:23,584 --> 00:12:26,584
-How can I thank you for that?
-By drying those tears.

167
00:12:26,878 --> 00:12:29,878
By seeing you happy
I feel well repaid.

168
00:12:30,837 --> 00:12:33,837
Oh, son, how could you do it?

169
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:36,463
You didn't think
of your mother's suffering.

170
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:39,464
Sorry, mommy.
I swear I'll never do it again, ever.

171
00:12:40,715 --> 00:12:43,715
Carlitos!

172
00:12:43,967 --> 00:12:46,842
You think you behaved properly?

173
00:12:46,843 --> 00:12:48,842
When I was little
and ran away from home,

174
00:12:48,843 --> 00:12:51,843
I returned with my tail between
my legs and not smiling.

175
00:12:51,845 --> 00:12:53,761
I should spank you.

176
00:12:53,762 --> 00:12:56,762
Forgive me for leaving, father,
but I didn't steal anything.

177
00:12:58,096 --> 00:13:01,096
It's alright. Alright.
Please forgive me, son.

178
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:04,681
Forgive me too,
but I have to leave.

179
00:13:04,682 --> 00:13:07,682
-Carlos, Mister...
-Julio Mistral, at your service.

180
00:13:07,767 --> 00:13:10,141
Mr. Mistral found Carlitos
and brought him to us.

181
00:13:10,142 --> 00:13:12,768
-At your service, Mr. Montero.
-No formalities.

182
00:13:12,769 --> 00:13:15,769
Allow me to embrace you and treat
you as my best friend from now on.

183
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:18,144
-Julio, right?
-Yes, sir.

184
00:13:18,145 --> 00:13:21,145
Well then Julio, Carlos and Rosario.
Don't you think so, dear?

185
00:13:21,439 --> 00:13:24,439
Of course. Without him think what
could have happened to Carlitos.

186
00:13:24,898 --> 00:13:27,898
Ma'am, I'm delighted to have
met you. You too, Sir...

187
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:30,941
I mean, Carlos.

188
00:13:30,983 --> 00:13:33,942
And till soon I hope, because
I intend to become a customer.

189
00:13:33,943 --> 00:13:36,276
You can't leave without first
having a drink.

190
00:13:36,277 --> 00:13:37,693
Carlos, the gentleman...

191
00:13:37,694 --> 00:13:40,653
Keep quiet. What do you know
about men's stuff?

192
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:43,070
I bet you have never had
a cognac like this one.

193
00:13:43,071 --> 00:13:44,111
Pure nectar.

194
00:13:44,112 --> 00:13:46,779
I thank you for your kindness
but you must be anxious...

195
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:49,738
-to be alone with your son and...
-In due time, my friend Julio.

196
00:13:49,739 --> 00:13:51,864
Rosario, what do you think
of inviting him to dinner...

197
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:53,281
to celebrate our meeting?

198
00:13:53,282 --> 00:13:56,282
-It will be my pleasure.
-You heard it. Said and done.

199
00:13:57,451 --> 00:14:00,451
That will teach you not
to go around being a do-gooder.

200
00:14:00,661 --> 00:14:03,661
-To your health.
-Cheers.

201
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:10,830
Excellent wine, right?
Well, if I don't say it, who will?

202
00:14:11,956 --> 00:14:14,122
We'll have coffee
in the living room, Rosario.

203
00:14:14,123 --> 00:14:15,622
Coffee with a tad of cognac.

204
00:14:15,623 --> 00:14:18,457
Well, more than a tad.

205
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,666
Come on in my friend, Julio.

206
00:14:20,667 --> 00:14:23,167
Remember, no formalities.

207
00:14:23,168 --> 00:14:26,168
-As long as you don't get bored.
-Please, don't say that.

208
00:14:26,794 --> 00:14:29,794
Perhaps you like fun people.
The night life, night clubs.

209
00:14:31,462 --> 00:14:34,462
You're young. I bet you are
a womanizer and a gambler.

210
00:14:36,715 --> 00:14:39,715
Carlos, please. You are speaking
inappropriately to our friend.

211
00:14:40,883 --> 00:14:43,341
You're mistaken, Don Carlos.

212
00:14:43,342 --> 00:14:46,342
Gambling bores me
and easy women are not to my liking.

213
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:49,759
I'm crazy about my profession
and I would like to have a family.

214
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:53,469
You're a romantic.

215
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:55,971
Although I imagine
that in the forestry business,

216
00:14:55,972 --> 00:14:58,972
a good engineer
with some political backing...

217
00:14:59,056 --> 00:15:02,056
could get rich in no time.

218
00:15:02,599 --> 00:15:05,599
By the way, do you smoke cigars?

219
00:15:05,725 --> 00:15:07,099
Don't tell me you don't.

220
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,516
You'll smoke one today!

221
00:15:08,517 --> 00:15:11,351
I have some cigars
that are delicious.

222
00:15:11,352 --> 00:15:13,684
I'll bring them.

223
00:15:13,685 --> 00:15:16,518
I'm taking advantage
of your hospitality, ma'am. I'll go.

224
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:19,519
No, please. Besides,
you heard my husband.

225
00:15:20,313 --> 00:15:22,521
A very cordial man.

226
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:25,522
I'm sure that behind those rough
manners he hides a good heart...

227
00:15:26,023 --> 00:15:28,357
and I believe he sees
me as a friend.

228
00:15:28,358 --> 00:15:31,358
What I regret is that you don't.

229
00:15:31,817 --> 00:15:34,359
Why do you say that?
I don't understand.

230
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,818
I'm under the impression that
my presence here bothers you and...

231
00:15:36,819 --> 00:15:39,819
Not at all. From thevery
first moment I...

232
00:15:41,153 --> 00:15:44,153
Thanks to you I recovered my son
and I will never forget it.

233
00:15:44,655 --> 00:15:47,655
I'm happy to be mistaken, because
you seem admirable and, well...

234
00:15:53,325 --> 00:15:56,325
Here they are.

235
00:15:59,368 --> 00:16:01,493
You'll see
what great cigars these are.

236
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:02,827
Yes, they seem excellent.

237
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:04,535
The box is for you.

238
00:16:04,536 --> 00:16:06,620
No, for God's sake,
that's too much. I beg you to...

239
00:16:06,621 --> 00:16:09,121
No, no, this way each time
you smoke a cigar...

240
00:16:09,122 --> 00:16:11,079
you'll remember
your friend Carlos.

241
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:14,080
Well, thank you very much.

242
00:16:15,665 --> 00:16:18,375
In order to try to reciprocate
your hospitality...

243
00:16:18,376 --> 00:16:21,376
I would like you to come and spend
a day with me in my woods.

244
00:16:21,584 --> 00:16:24,501
They are not mine,
but I'm in love with them.

245
00:16:24,502 --> 00:16:26,752
I assure you that you
won't be bored.

246
00:16:26,753 --> 00:16:29,002
It wouldn't be a bad idea,
right, Rosario?

247
00:16:29,003 --> 00:16:30,836
And where are those woods?

248
00:16:30,837 --> 00:16:33,837
On the highway to Toluca
at kilometer 39.

249
00:16:34,089 --> 00:16:37,089
Man, what a coincidence!
Tomorrow I have to go to Toluca.

250
00:16:37,507 --> 00:16:40,507
I'll wait on the highway
around ten o'clock in the morning.

251
00:16:41,549 --> 00:16:44,549
Sure. You can stay with the boy
in the fresh air and sun.

252
00:16:45,509 --> 00:16:48,342
I'll continue on my way
and be back in time to eat.

253
00:16:48,343 --> 00:16:50,802
Because I'm sure there will be
something to eat.

254
00:16:50,803 --> 00:16:53,177
Of course, the best trout
in the country.

255
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:56,178
Not one more word.
We'll be there at ten o'clock.

256
00:17:12,227 --> 00:17:15,227
How are you, Carlitos? Ma'am.

257
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:19,354
Dear friend,
you have British punctuality.

258
00:17:19,355 --> 00:17:21,438
Punctuality is my middle name.

259
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,439
I won't tolerate informality;
neither my own nor that of others.

260
00:17:25,481 --> 00:17:28,481
-Can I catch a trout?
-One? A dozen at least.

261
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:32,190
Yes, son, fish a lot,
your father's stomach will thank you.

262
00:17:32,442 --> 00:17:35,442
Well, I'll leave now
so I can come back sooner.

263
00:17:37,444 --> 00:17:39,943
Do you need anything from town?

264
00:17:39,944 --> 00:17:41,028
No, nothing.

265
00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:43,654
We have everything.
Wine, ham, cheese, trout...

266
00:17:43,655 --> 00:17:46,655
Stop, otherwise I'll stay.

267
00:17:46,697 --> 00:17:48,363
Thank you. Goodbye.

268
00:17:48,364 --> 00:17:50,823
So long.

269
00:17:50,824 --> 00:17:52,949
And let Rosario help
with the cooking.

270
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:55,199
She's an expert.

271
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,200
So long.

272
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:16,290
Mom, look what a big trout!

273
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:21,875
Look at my son. He is happy.

274
00:18:22,377 --> 00:18:24,793
It must be marvelous living here.

275
00:18:24,794 --> 00:18:27,794
Yes, especially for me since I love
the solitude and the mountains.

276
00:18:28,711 --> 00:18:31,711
In these woods everything is pure,
until men and machines arrive.

277
00:18:32,172 --> 00:18:34,838
They destroy everything.

278
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:37,839
Look at that tree, it is venerably old,
and to think they will make...

279
00:18:39,591 --> 00:18:42,591
tables and chairs out of it
for vulgar people...

280
00:18:44,384 --> 00:18:47,384
By the way, why is
your husband taking so long?

281
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:49,593
Why do you laugh?

282
00:18:49,594 --> 00:18:52,594
You remembered him after
mentioning vulgar people.

283
00:18:53,804 --> 00:18:55,970
Yes, why should I deny it?

284
00:18:55,971 --> 00:18:58,013
You're so different,
I don't understand how...

285
00:18:58,014 --> 00:18:59,555
you fell in love with him.

286
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:01,097
Fall in love?

287
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,557
Forgive me for being so indiscreet,
but I'm so interested...

288
00:19:03,558 --> 00:19:05,307
in everything about you.

289
00:19:05,308 --> 00:19:08,308
If you didn't love him
why did you marry him?

290
00:19:08,892 --> 00:19:11,892
I was very young.
Almost a child and...

291
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:13,851
I'd rather not discuss that.

292
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:16,852
Mother, mother!

293
00:19:19,604 --> 00:19:21,438
Look how many fish.

294
00:19:21,439 --> 00:19:23,564
They are beautiful!

295
00:19:23,565 --> 00:19:26,398
Why don't we eat them now?
I'm hungry.

296
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:27,731
It's almost three o'clock.

297
00:19:27,732 --> 00:19:29,399
I can't understand
why he is so late.

298
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,066
Business is business.

299
00:19:31,067 --> 00:19:32,942
I want to eat!

300
00:19:32,943 --> 00:19:35,068
Well, then we'll eat.
We have waited long enough.

301
00:19:35,069 --> 00:19:38,069
Very good! Come on!

302
00:19:38,528 --> 00:19:41,528
He can eat alone when he returns.

303
00:20:07,913 --> 00:20:10,913
What's the use of loving

304
00:20:17,834 --> 00:20:20,834
With all your heart?

305
00:20:24,002 --> 00:20:27,002
What's the use of suffering

306
00:20:30,088 --> 00:20:33,088
Respecting love?

307
00:20:36,215 --> 00:20:39,215
For me, there is only you...

308
00:21:06,017 --> 00:21:09,017
He fell asleep,
it's past his bedtime.

309
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:11,059
It's almost 8 o'clock.

310
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:14,060
I don't understand
why Carlos is so late.

311
00:21:14,269 --> 00:21:16,144
Does it bother you
to be alone with me?

312
00:21:16,145 --> 00:21:19,145
Don't say that. I'm embarrassed
about my husband's behavior.

313
00:21:22,397 --> 00:21:24,189
Why are you always so sad?

314
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:26,857
I don't know.
Perhaps it's the habit.

315
00:21:26,858 --> 00:21:29,608
You don't know how sorry
I am to know you are unhappy.

316
00:21:29,609 --> 00:21:32,609
Today I have been happy
for the first time in many years.

317
00:21:34,777 --> 00:21:37,777
This afternoon you didn't
answer my question.

318
00:21:38,112 --> 00:21:41,112
Why did you marry him?

319
00:21:41,238 --> 00:21:44,238
Carlos was my parents' friend.
A good friend.

320
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,280
He was very rich and
we were very poor.

321
00:21:49,281 --> 00:21:52,281
That's crazy.To condemn you
to not knowing what love is.

322
00:21:52,742 --> 00:21:55,742
-And at your age.
-Really, I don't mind.

323
00:21:55,993 --> 00:21:58,576
Some women don't have
a husband or son.

324
00:21:58,577 --> 00:22:01,577
But they have love.

325
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,911
You're a very young woman
who spends her life...

326
00:22:04,912 --> 00:22:07,912
beside a man she doesn't love
and who doesn't understand her.

327
00:22:08,956 --> 00:22:11,956
A woman who lives a lonelier life
than these woods.

328
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:15,956
There is no loneliness
when one has a child.

329
00:22:15,957 --> 00:22:18,957
That's not enough.
You have never loved anyone?

330
00:22:27,004 --> 00:22:30,004
Rosario! Julio!

331
00:22:31,131 --> 00:22:33,588
Where are you?

332
00:22:33,589 --> 00:22:36,589
Carlitos.

333
00:22:36,798 --> 00:22:39,798
You can't see anything
in this damn place.

334
00:22:40,675 --> 00:22:43,675
You must be very angry with me,
but it was unavoidable.

335
00:22:44,093 --> 00:22:47,093
Is there any trout left?

336
00:22:47,886 --> 00:22:50,886
I didn't forget about that.

337
00:23:22,023 --> 00:23:25,023
Finally.

338
00:23:25,982 --> 00:23:28,982
I've been restless, desperate.
Why did you take so long?

339
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:32,359
You can imagine.
I'm not free, Julio.

340
00:23:33,485 --> 00:23:35,526
Give me your coat.

341
00:23:35,527 --> 00:23:38,486
I come for only a moment.
Forgive me.

342
00:23:38,487 --> 00:23:41,487
I was so anxious to come here,
and you see, I can't stay long.

343
00:23:41,863 --> 00:23:44,863
It's very late.

344
00:23:51,699 --> 00:23:54,699
I spent all afternoon waiting for you.
Smoking like a fiend.

345
00:23:55,492 --> 00:23:58,160
Worrying about what might
have happened to you...

346
00:23:58,161 --> 00:24:00,285
if you weren't coming, after all.

347
00:24:00,286 --> 00:24:02,619
I was tempted to call the store.

348
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:05,620
To go for you. I don't know.

349
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:11,622
Look, Julio, if it were up to me...

350
00:24:11,623 --> 00:24:14,623
you know I would never
be away from you.

351
00:24:15,167 --> 00:24:18,167
I swear that each time
our goodbyes seem harder.

352
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:21,959
I want to see you always.
Feel you near me every minute.

353
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:29,086
We can't go on like this, Rosario.

354
00:24:29,087 --> 00:24:31,129
I don't want to share you
with him anymore.

355
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:34,130
Don't be cruel.
It is also terrible for me.

356
00:24:34,923 --> 00:24:37,923
You wait, but you don't have
to live with another woman.

357
00:24:40,591 --> 00:24:43,591
Nor do you have to lie, to pretend,
or to smile forcefully.

358
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:48,260
Nor hide whenever you
want to cry.

359
00:24:48,261 --> 00:24:51,261
Forgive me, my darling,
but I love you so much...

360
00:24:51,845 --> 00:24:54,845
I can't stand it any more either.
This is my house.

361
00:24:55,805 --> 00:24:58,555
You are my world.

362
00:24:58,556 --> 00:25:01,556
Each day I hate Carlos even more,
but lying is the worst part.

363
00:25:02,558 --> 00:25:05,558
The shame, the humiliation
of having to lie is just unbearable.

364
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:10,350
Stop fighting it.
Get divorced and marry me.

365
00:25:11,687 --> 00:25:14,144
I can't leave my son, Julio.

366
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:17,145
I have thought about it
thousands of times and I can't.

367
00:25:17,229 --> 00:25:20,188
What if we run away together
and take your son with us?

368
00:25:20,189 --> 00:25:23,189
We'll take the road
and when we are far away from here,

369
00:25:23,481 --> 00:25:26,190
we'll write Carlos
telling him the truth.

370
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:29,191
Would you do it, my darling?

371
00:25:30,859 --> 00:25:32,693
I want whatever you want.

372
00:25:32,694 --> 00:25:34,443
Listen to me then.

373
00:25:34,444 --> 00:25:37,235
Tomorrow at nightfall,
come here with Carlitos.

374
00:25:37,236 --> 00:25:40,236
We'll immediately take a train
and go to any city to prepare our trip.

375
00:25:40,987 --> 00:25:43,987
To Brazil where they have
offered me a marvelous job.

376
00:25:44,114 --> 00:25:46,488
Say yes, my love.

377
00:25:46,489 --> 00:25:49,489
Yes, my darling.
I'll go wherever you want.

378
00:25:49,908 --> 00:25:52,365
I want to live my love by daylight.

379
00:25:52,366 --> 00:25:53,658
I'll be back tomorrow.

380
00:25:53,659 --> 00:25:56,659
Rosario.

381
00:26:10,414 --> 00:26:12,247
Three first class tickets
to Vera Cruz.

382
00:26:12,248 --> 00:26:15,248
-For when, sir?
-For tonight's train.

383
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:31,921
Rosario, thank God you are here!

384
00:26:31,922 --> 00:26:34,922
It took you so long
I thought you weren't coming.

385
00:26:35,716 --> 00:26:38,716
We have just enough time
to get to the train.

386
00:26:43,009 --> 00:26:46,009
And the boy? What happened?
Answer me.

387
00:26:47,261 --> 00:26:50,053
I can't go with you, Julio.
I came only to...

388
00:26:50,054 --> 00:26:53,054
What? Explain yourself,
for heaven's sake!

389
00:26:53,722 --> 00:26:56,722
We have to put our plan aside.
For now, at least.

390
00:26:57,598 --> 00:27:00,389
-My husband...
-What? He knows something?

391
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:02,723
You told him about us
and he has taken the boy?

392
00:27:02,724 --> 00:27:05,724
No, he suffered a heart attack
this morning. Angina pectoris.

393
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,560
I must return immediateIy.
I only came to tell you.

394
00:27:14,228 --> 00:27:17,228
Is he very ill?

395
00:27:18,856 --> 00:27:21,564
Rosario, I'll go with you
in case something is needed.

396
00:27:21,565 --> 00:27:24,565
Let's go.

397
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:30,359
Julio, my Julio... My love...

398
00:27:32,236 --> 00:27:35,236
Calm down.
We'll discuss it later. Come on.

399
00:27:52,242 --> 00:27:55,242
Come in.

400
00:27:59,077 --> 00:28:02,077
As soon as I found out what
happened I came to see you.

401
00:28:03,204 --> 00:28:05,120
My good friend.

402
00:28:05,121 --> 00:28:06,622
How is he, doctor?

403
00:28:06,623 --> 00:28:09,623
Under the effect of medication.
He needs absolute rest.

404
00:28:10,415 --> 00:28:12,374
Not the least bit of excitement.

405
00:28:12,375 --> 00:28:14,915
I believe that for now
he is out of danger.

406
00:28:14,916 --> 00:28:16,750
I'll be back in an hour.

407
00:28:16,751 --> 00:28:19,751
In the meantime, lots of rest
and above all, no talking.

408
00:28:20,252 --> 00:28:23,252
Leave the boy here.

409
00:28:42,259 --> 00:28:43,592
I'll be at the clinic.

410
00:28:43,593 --> 00:28:46,176
If something happens before
I come back, call me immediately.

411
00:28:46,177 --> 00:28:47,719
He will be fine, doctor?

412
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,594
With the heart one never knows.

413
00:28:49,595 --> 00:28:51,637
But if your husband
has no upsets or excitement,

414
00:28:51,637 --> 00:28:54,138
he may recover soon
and live for many years.

415
00:28:54,139 --> 00:28:57,139
-So long, ma'am.
-Thank you, doctor.

416
00:29:17,313 --> 00:29:20,313
I wonder what triggered the attack.
Does he suspect anything?

417
00:29:20,606 --> 00:29:23,606
No. I don't believe so.
He was in good spirits.

418
00:29:25,608 --> 00:29:28,608
If it had happened after we'd left
it would have been my fault.

419
00:29:30,192 --> 00:29:33,192
How could you know he was sick?
Who would blame you?

420
00:29:35,111 --> 00:29:36,777
I'm afraid, Julio.

421
00:29:36,778 --> 00:29:39,778
Calm down, I beg you.
You heard the doctor. He'll be okay.

422
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:44,446
It would be a crime
to leave him now.

423
00:29:44,447 --> 00:29:47,447
We'll wait 10, 15 days,
whatever is necessary, and then...

424
00:29:49,283 --> 00:29:52,283
nothing will break us apart.

425
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:10,997
What are you thinking about?

426
00:30:10,998 --> 00:30:13,624
Imagine, the boy didn't want
to come with me today.

427
00:30:13,625 --> 00:30:16,458
He has become very fond
of his father since his sickness,

428
00:30:16,459 --> 00:30:17,958
and my husband of him.

429
00:30:17,959 --> 00:30:20,959
It's natural.
They are father and son.

430
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:24,710
But answer the question I asked
before. When are we leaving?

431
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,378
Why don't you answer me?

432
00:30:27,379 --> 00:30:30,129
Why don't you even
look at me, Rosario?

433
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:33,130
Your husband is well now,
the doctor has said so.

434
00:30:33,715 --> 00:30:36,715
He can go backto his passion:
eating and drinking.

435
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:40,466
You don't have to feel guilty.

436
00:30:40,467 --> 00:30:43,467
We can go with a clear conscience.

437
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,093
There is something you don't know.

438
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:48,844
Now that I see how much
he and the boy love each other...

439
00:30:48,845 --> 00:30:51,303
I don't have the courage
to take him away.

440
00:30:51,304 --> 00:30:54,304
Leaving could kill him
and I would never forgive myself.

441
00:30:55,639 --> 00:30:58,056
I understand you don't love me
as much as I thought.

442
00:30:58,057 --> 00:31:01,057
Please. If I didn't love you
I would not confide in you...

443
00:31:02,392 --> 00:31:03,933
my most intimate thoughts.

444
00:31:03,934 --> 00:31:06,934
I talk to you as if to myself.

445
00:31:07,143 --> 00:31:10,143
You think I can abandon
my husband and rob him of his child?

446
00:31:10,978 --> 00:31:13,978
Let's wait longer.
There must be a way out.

447
00:31:14,145 --> 00:31:15,645
Away out?

448
00:31:15,646 --> 00:31:17,646
If I go on like this, I'll explode...

449
00:31:17,647 --> 00:31:20,647
and shout out everything
in your husband's presence.

450
00:31:20,981 --> 00:31:23,981
Bring your son or leave him,
but come with me.

451
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,649
You are not the first woman
in my life, Rosario,

452
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:31,317
but you are the only one
I have loved.

453
00:31:31,318 --> 00:31:33,985
The only one I will love
until I die.

454
00:31:33,986 --> 00:31:36,986
The decision to come to Brazil
with me or not is in your hands.

455
00:31:41,322 --> 00:31:44,155
Mom, look.

456
00:31:44,156 --> 00:31:46,156
Look, my little boat broke.

457
00:31:46,157 --> 00:31:49,157
It doesn't matter, dear.
I'll buy you another one.

458
00:31:49,158 --> 00:31:52,158
For the last time, Rosario,
yes or no?

459
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,369
In that case...

460
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:05,370
Goodbye, Rosario.

461
00:32:23,044 --> 00:32:26,044
ANTIQUES OF ALL SORTS

462
00:32:36,674 --> 00:32:39,674
UNIVERSITY OF MEXICO

463
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:55,305
Well, what do you say now, Ma'am?

464
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:58,306
What can I tell you, Don Feliciano?
I'm happy.

465
00:32:58,474 --> 00:33:01,474
I never thought Miguel
would graduate.

466
00:33:02,726 --> 00:33:05,308
I'm not very old,
but I can die in peace...

467
00:33:05,309 --> 00:33:07,434
because both my sons
are now doctors.

468
00:33:07,435 --> 00:33:10,060
And it's not a joke, you can see
how badly distributed...

469
00:33:10,061 --> 00:33:11,852
the riches are these days.

470
00:33:11,853 --> 00:33:14,853
A family of doctors when there
are families of sick people.

471
00:33:16,105 --> 00:33:19,105
Well, now... forget family
affairs and sentimentalities.

472
00:33:19,689 --> 00:33:22,065
Everybody wants to drink,
starting with me.

473
00:33:22,066 --> 00:33:24,732
Doctor, come on.
The girls want to dance.

474
00:33:24,733 --> 00:33:27,191
And why are you standing there?
Take care of the guests.

475
00:33:27,192 --> 00:33:28,775
Yes, I'm going. Come on, son.

476
00:33:28,776 --> 00:33:31,109
Your father is right,
dance and enjoy yourseIf.

477
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:34,110
Come on. Come on.

478
00:33:37,821 --> 00:33:40,821
Doctor, will you allow me
to care for your patient?

479
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:43,114
Your behavior shocks me,
young colleague.

480
00:33:43,115 --> 00:33:45,155
Professional ethics
forbid a doctor...

481
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:46,698
from taking another
doctor's patient away.

482
00:33:46,699 --> 00:33:49,699
I don't plan on taking her away.
It's simply a consultation.

483
00:33:50,908 --> 00:33:53,908
Well, alright, I agree as long
as the patient doesn't object.

484
00:33:55,077 --> 00:33:58,077
Well, my dear colleagues, even
though I admire the knowledge...

485
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:01,161
of Dr. Carlos, my friend
and teacher, I still recognize...

486
00:34:01,246 --> 00:34:04,079
-the merits of the new doctor.
-So, you mean...

487
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,080
In case of an appendectomy,
I would choose you.

488
00:34:07,414 --> 00:34:09,997
But when it pertains to dancing,
I choose our young doctor...

489
00:34:09,998 --> 00:34:11,414
who is more of an expert.

490
00:34:11,415 --> 00:34:14,415
Allow me, colleague.

491
00:34:21,211 --> 00:34:22,877
Do you wish to dance, ma'am?

492
00:34:22,878 --> 00:34:25,253
For heaven's sake, son,
I haven't danced in a long time.

493
00:34:25,254 --> 00:34:28,170
Come on, mother, I want to teach
Miguel and his partner a lesson.

494
00:34:28,171 --> 00:34:30,296
I want them to learn to dance
the waltz properly.

495
00:34:30,297 --> 00:34:33,297
Are you going to deny him that?
Come on, dance!

496
00:35:23,233 --> 00:35:25,190
Don't drink anymore,
I beg you.

497
00:35:25,191 --> 00:35:27,482
But I drink  because the doctor
prescribed it, woman.

498
00:35:27,483 --> 00:35:30,067
We're among doctors
and I'm sure they will approve.

499
00:35:30,068 --> 00:35:31,651
Don't you agree?

500
00:35:31,652 --> 00:35:34,652
And I drink to modern medicine
that prescribes whiskey...

501
00:35:35,028 --> 00:35:38,028
for the aliments of the heart,
and therefore, I make a toast...

502
00:35:38,904 --> 00:35:41,904
to the doctors who prescribe it.

503
00:35:47,241 --> 00:35:50,241
And now, my friends,
we'll have a bite to eat.

504
00:36:09,665 --> 00:36:12,665
Carlos, Miguel, come upstairs,
your father has something to tell you.

505
00:36:27,463 --> 00:36:30,463
Boys, I want to tell you something
that will interest you.

506
00:36:32,965 --> 00:36:35,965
I have been doing some inquiring
and it seems that a clinic...

507
00:36:36,716 --> 00:36:38,257
is a great business, right?

508
00:36:38,258 --> 00:36:40,591
That's for sure.
Why do you say that?

509
00:36:40,592 --> 00:36:43,592
I'm not rich, but I'm on the verge
of closing a good business deal...

510
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:46,469
selling a few lots of land.

511
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:49,262
And I thought that instead of putting
the money under the mattress,

512
00:36:49,263 --> 00:36:51,804
it would be a good idea
to invest it in a clinic.

513
00:36:51,805 --> 00:36:54,805
That's a marvelous idea, father.
Can you imagine, Miguel?A clinic!

514
00:36:55,098 --> 00:36:56,389
Our dream.

515
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:59,390
Everything sounds nice,
but is it a good business or not?

516
00:36:59,474 --> 00:37:00,766
Because you know I don't...

517
00:37:00,767 --> 00:37:02,892
Of course, father.
If you manage it well.

518
00:37:02,893 --> 00:37:04,767
Carlos would be the director
and I the assistant.

519
00:37:04,768 --> 00:37:07,601
And we could also have
a research laboratory.

520
00:37:07,602 --> 00:37:10,602
Yes, son. I have also dreamed
of having you both settled...

521
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:13,603
and when your father had that idea
I was overjoyed.

522
00:37:13,688 --> 00:37:16,688
Well, things being what they are,
it was her idea.

523
00:37:16,689 --> 00:37:19,689
And she bothered me so much
she convinced me.

524
00:37:19,773 --> 00:37:22,731
-You're a wonderful mother,
-The most beautiful.

525
00:37:22,732 --> 00:37:24,441
-And as good as no other.
-Well, be quiet...

526
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:26,525
Well, so that's it.

527
00:37:26,526 --> 00:37:29,526
Go find a house, but remember,
you have to pay me back.

528
00:37:30,319 --> 00:37:33,319
-Ah, yes.
-Why didn't you tell us before?

529
00:37:41,948 --> 00:37:43,781
It's beautiful, son. Beautiful.

530
00:37:43,782 --> 00:37:45,949
I find it ideal,
very cheerful for a clinic.

531
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:48,950
A place like this and nobody will doubt we are good doctors, right?

532
00:37:49,492 --> 00:37:51,408
Nevertheless,
I think the rent is too high.

533
00:37:51,409 --> 00:37:53,867
I'll speak with your father who
knows a lot about this...

534
00:37:53,868 --> 00:37:56,285
and you'll see how he gets
a good deal.

535
00:37:56,286 --> 00:37:59,078
I think it is a steaI.

536
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:02,079
And by means of a long term loan
for which I will soon apply,

537
00:38:02,371 --> 00:38:05,371
we'll be able to install
the most modern x-ray equipment.

538
00:38:05,706 --> 00:38:07,288
But that costs a lot of money.

539
00:38:07,289 --> 00:38:10,039
They are not inexpensive,
but here the clientele is very rich.

540
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,165
Let's see my office.

541
00:38:12,166 --> 00:38:15,166
Yes, son.

542
00:38:25,046 --> 00:38:28,046
How would you like this office
for yourself?

543
00:38:28,129 --> 00:38:31,129
I love it, as I love
all your projects.

544
00:38:31,923 --> 00:38:34,923
I'm so anxious for you to make
money so we can...

545
00:38:34,966 --> 00:38:37,174
so you can dedicate yourself
to your research.

546
00:38:37,175 --> 00:38:39,842
If you really want me to be
successful, why not...?

547
00:38:39,843 --> 00:38:41,633
Why not what?

548
00:38:41,634 --> 00:38:44,634
I don't know how to say it.

549
00:38:44,845 --> 00:38:47,511
But instead of being
chief of nutrition,

550
00:38:47,512 --> 00:38:49,804
why don't you become
the owner ofthis house?

551
00:38:49,805 --> 00:38:52,805
With director and all.
Don't you like the idea?

552
00:38:54,264 --> 00:38:56,473
I like it and I'm touched, Carlos.

553
00:38:56,474 --> 00:38:59,474
You have been my colleague,
my teacher... but I don't know.

554
00:39:01,058 --> 00:39:04,058
Right now it would
be impossible to think about that.

555
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:07,060
Why change friendship for love?

556
00:39:07,853 --> 00:39:10,853
Don't make that face. Perhaps I
shouldn't give an answer yet.

557
00:39:12,145 --> 00:39:15,145
Why don't we leave it pending
for some time?

558
00:39:16,231 --> 00:39:19,231
If you wish, but you are for me
above all a woman, not a doctor.

559
00:39:21,648 --> 00:39:24,648
Not a colleague, not even a pupil
as you claim.

560
00:39:25,234 --> 00:39:28,234
I'll wait all the time necessary.

561
00:39:28,443 --> 00:39:30,110
Now, let's talk about
something else.

562
00:39:30,111 --> 00:39:32,193
Tomorrow you'll come
with me to the hospital.

563
00:39:32,194 --> 00:39:35,194
I'll show you the new installation
ofthe bacteriological lab.

564
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,320
We have German microscopes.

565
00:39:37,321 --> 00:39:39,820
Good morning, doctor.
Am I interrupting?

566
00:39:39,821 --> 00:39:41,489
Rita! What are you doing here?

567
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:43,114
The same as you.

568
00:39:43,115 --> 00:39:46,115
Dr. Manzano had also
cast an eye upon this house.

569
00:39:47,033 --> 00:39:49,407
Do you know each other?
This is Dr. Sunsula.

570
00:39:49,408 --> 00:39:51,908
The doctor is very well known.

571
00:39:51,909 --> 00:39:54,909
They say that her method of feeding
children extends into adulthood.

572
00:39:57,829 --> 00:39:59,620
What is your opinion, doctor?

573
00:39:59,621 --> 00:40:00,828
I think...

574
00:40:00,829 --> 00:40:03,829
As an adult, the doctor
thinks it is all nurses' gossip.

575
00:40:04,498 --> 00:40:05,872
Isn't it so, Carlos?

576
00:40:05,873 --> 00:40:08,748
-Yes, of course.
-See you soon, little doctor.

577
00:40:08,749 --> 00:40:11,749
It's a pleasure to see you in such
professional and nutritious company.

578
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:18,417
What did she mean, Carlos?

579
00:40:18,418 --> 00:40:20,085
Have you had anything
to do with that woman?

580
00:40:20,086 --> 00:40:23,086
Absolutely nothing. But she thinks
all doctors and patients love her.

581
00:40:24,879 --> 00:40:26,337
What is it with you two?

582
00:40:26,338 --> 00:40:29,338
-Nothing. We were just talking.
-Come on, mother is waiting for us.

583
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,510
What a scoundrel!

584
00:40:41,511 --> 00:40:43,176
What's the matter, Carlos?

585
00:40:43,177 --> 00:40:46,177
Can you imagine him wanting
to cheat me at this point,

586
00:40:46,637 --> 00:40:49,053
but since nobody robs me,
I cancelled the deal.

587
00:40:49,054 --> 00:40:50,304
What are you saying?

588
00:40:50,305 --> 00:40:53,305
That thief settled for only
130,000 pesos...

589
00:40:54,681 --> 00:40:57,390
and today the land is worth
at least twice as much.

590
00:40:57,391 --> 00:41:00,056
But you paid much less.

591
00:41:00,057 --> 00:41:03,057
We just need to make some money
to settle Carlos in.

592
00:41:03,851 --> 00:41:06,434
You don't know a thing about business.
You don't.

593
00:41:06,435 --> 00:41:08,602
Remember when we
transferred the store,

594
00:41:08,603 --> 00:41:11,519
we almost gave it away for nothing
because of your interference.

595
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,520
Forgive me,
but I take back everything.

596
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:17,355
You don't know how sorry I am.

597
00:41:17,356 --> 00:41:20,356
But, father, I already made a deal
with the owner of the house...

598
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,690
and with the stores.

599
00:41:21,691 --> 00:41:24,691
No, it's not definite.

600
00:41:24,734 --> 00:41:27,734
I have to wait to sell at a good
price to an honest person.

601
00:41:28,485 --> 00:41:31,485
Forgive me and don't worry.
Everything will be solved in time.

602
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:40,780
Father, Mr. Palafoz
is on his way here.

603
00:41:40,906 --> 00:41:43,489
Don Nicolas Palafoz,
the notary public?

604
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:44,698
Yes, him.

605
00:41:44,699 --> 00:41:47,699
Funny. He hasn't been in
this house for years.

606
00:41:48,284 --> 00:41:51,284
He told me it was something
urgent and important.

607
00:41:55,952 --> 00:41:57,494
Have you heard, Rosario?

608
00:41:57,495 --> 00:41:59,536
Yes, and I wonder what
it could be.

609
00:41:59,537 --> 00:42:02,537
Well, imagine.
When it comes to a notary...

610
00:42:02,539 --> 00:42:04,830
It must involve an inheritance.

611
00:42:04,831 --> 00:42:06,915
We would like that,
but from whom?

612
00:42:06,916 --> 00:42:08,831
Could it be from your
Uncle Agustin?

613
00:42:08,832 --> 00:42:11,374
He would leave only debts.
Don't worry.

614
00:42:11,375 --> 00:42:12,666
I was thinking about your
Cousin Juana.

615
00:42:12,667 --> 00:42:14,792
-Sure, that one is rich.
-Forget it.

616
00:42:14,793 --> 00:42:17,793
She married again
and with a young man.

617
00:42:17,877 --> 00:42:19,169
Where are you going?

618
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:21,294
You can keep guessing.
I'm going to my room.

619
00:42:21,295 --> 00:42:22,836
But why? What's the matter?

620
00:42:22,837 --> 00:42:25,837
After today's letdown, I'm not
in the mood for guessing games.

621
00:42:26,923 --> 00:42:28,296
He's right.

622
00:42:28,297 --> 00:42:31,297
Mr. Palafoz.

623
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:34,549
Come in, Don Nicolas. Come in.

624
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:36,550
It's been such a long time
since last we saw you.

625
00:42:36,551 --> 00:42:39,551
What can I say, Don Carlos, Ma'am?
At your service.

626
00:42:40,677 --> 00:42:41,884
How are you, Don Nicolas?

627
00:42:41,885 --> 00:42:44,094
Not so bad, Doctor.

628
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:46,011
I already said hello
to Miguelito downstairs.

629
00:42:46,012 --> 00:42:47,219
Won't you sit down?

630
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:49,846
And tell us what brings you here?
Care for a drink?

631
00:42:49,847 --> 00:42:52,847
I'll sit down, yes, Ma'am.
And I'll tell you, Sir.

632
00:42:53,682 --> 00:42:56,682
And for the moment, I won't
drink anything. Thank you.

633
00:42:57,141 --> 00:43:00,141
Before I start I must tell you I'm
here as a notary, not as a friend.

634
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:05,600
In said capacity
I must give you bad news.

635
00:43:08,311 --> 00:43:11,227
What can I say,
it's part of the job.

636
00:43:11,228 --> 00:43:14,228
I've been notified by a Brazilian
colleague about the death...

637
00:43:15,897 --> 00:43:18,897
of a  friend of yours.

638
00:43:19,023 --> 00:43:22,023
It's about Mr. Mistral.

639
00:43:23,983 --> 00:43:26,983
-Julio Mistral.
-Dead?

640
00:43:27,568 --> 00:43:30,568
Julio Mistral, the engineer?

641
00:43:30,569 --> 00:43:33,569
Exactly, ma'am. Yes, sir.

642
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:37,612
It happened over
a month ago in Sao Paulo, Brazil.

643
00:43:39,323 --> 00:43:42,323
Who would have thought!
Such a kind friend, so refined.

644
00:43:45,158 --> 00:43:48,158
I still remember how he took care
of me when I had my angina.

645
00:43:48,366 --> 00:43:51,366
He was so thoughtful.
Do you remember, Rosario?

646
00:43:52,117 --> 00:43:55,117
I haven't forgotten.
He was so fond of Carlitos.

647
00:43:56,911 --> 00:43:58,536
You don't remember him, son?

648
00:43:58,537 --> 00:44:01,537
He's the man that brought you
home when you ran away.

649
00:44:01,539 --> 00:44:04,539
Yes, I had not made
the connection.

650
00:44:05,415 --> 00:44:08,415
He taught me to fish trout.
I was very small.

651
00:44:10,458 --> 00:44:13,458
-Did I know him, father?
-Let me see no.

652
00:44:15,293 --> 00:44:18,168
You where born some months
after he went to Brazil,

653
00:44:18,169 --> 00:44:20,169
to do his foresting.

654
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:22,086
That's so sad, dear God.

655
00:44:22,087 --> 00:44:25,087
If you don't mind holding
your thoughts for a moment,

656
00:44:26,089 --> 00:44:29,089
that engineer Mistral left a will
and if you allow me,

657
00:44:30,006 --> 00:44:33,006
I will begin to read it.

658
00:44:35,174 --> 00:44:38,049
Let's see.

659
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:41,050
"In the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil,
at the date of the month etc.

660
00:44:43,386 --> 00:44:46,386
"I, Julio Mistral, being of sound
mind but ailing body,

661
00:44:48,721 --> 00:44:51,721
"leave all my personal fortune
that amounts to...

662
00:44:52,347 --> 00:44:55,347
"a million one hundred thousand
pesos, Mexican currency,

663
00:44:55,807 --> 00:44:58,807
"to the son of my dear friends
Carlos and Rosario Montero,

664
00:45:00,476 --> 00:45:03,476
"Miguel Montero Jimenez".

665
00:45:05,268 --> 00:45:08,268
One million one hundred
thousand pesos to me?

666
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:12,270
Should the beneficiary hesitate,
or if his disappearance...

667
00:45:15,106 --> 00:45:18,106
prevents him from receiving
the inheritance,

668
00:45:18,106 --> 00:45:21,106
the money will then go
to the Muir foundation...

669
00:45:21,524 --> 00:45:24,524
towards the help
of the destitute, etc. etc.

670
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:28,359
Well, I will now accept that
whiskey,

671
00:45:28,943 --> 00:45:31,943
if you're so kind in order to drink
to the health of the young heir.

672
00:45:35,071 --> 00:45:38,071
Nevertheless, what I can't
understand is why...

673
00:45:39,614 --> 00:45:42,197
he remembered us after
all these years.

674
00:45:42,198 --> 00:45:44,866
Do you understand it, woman?

675
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:47,867
Yes, he adored children,
was very kind,

676
00:45:48,368 --> 00:45:51,368
as it seems he had nobody,
had not married...

677
00:45:51,618 --> 00:45:54,034
But why did he leave it to me?

678
00:45:54,035 --> 00:45:57,035
Perhaps because you are
the youngest.

679
00:45:57,829 --> 00:46:00,829
Your son will have to declare
his acceptance formally.

680
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:03,996
Of course he accepts,
is it not so, Miguelito?

681
00:46:03,997 --> 00:46:06,997
Tell me, Don Nicolas,
that money is free from all...

682
00:46:08,957 --> 00:46:11,957
There are no debts, nor any
other heir that might contest...

683
00:46:12,625 --> 00:46:15,625
Nothing, nothing. It's the most
simple and direct donation...

684
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,293
I have handled.

685
00:46:19,294 --> 00:46:21,210
Thank you.

686
00:46:21,211 --> 00:46:23,629
Then you accept, Don Miguel?

687
00:46:23,630 --> 00:46:26,630
Well, of course we accept.
Does he have to sign anything now?

688
00:46:26,672 --> 00:46:29,672
No. Tomorrow at 12 in my office.

689
00:46:29,923 --> 00:46:32,923
To your health, then,
and congratulations.

690
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:51,597
That poor Julio was a true friend.
And he had a great heart.

691
00:46:52,306 --> 00:46:55,306
Who would have thought I would
have a millionaire son.

692
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:57,056
How do you feel, Miguelito?

693
00:46:57,057 --> 00:46:58,891
Frankly, father, a little stunned.

694
00:46:58,892 --> 00:47:01,267
And why are you sad?

695
00:47:01,268 --> 00:47:03,976
It hurts me to think he died
far away from his friends.

696
00:47:03,977 --> 00:47:05,434
But remembering them.

697
00:47:05,435 --> 00:47:08,435
I have to leave, but first I want
to congratulate you, Miguel.

698
00:47:08,603 --> 00:47:11,061
-Thank you, Carlos.
-Where are you going, son?

699
00:47:11,062 --> 00:47:13,730
Excuse me, mother, but I'm
on duty at the hospital.

700
00:47:13,731 --> 00:47:16,063
But it is very early.
Won't you eat with us?

701
00:47:16,064 --> 00:47:19,064
I'm sorry, but I have a headache
and would like to walk.

702
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:22,400
Leave him alone. I bet he's sad
about the death of his friend.

703
00:47:25,985 --> 00:47:28,985
-See you tomorrow, mother.
-Goodbye, son.

704
00:47:29,402 --> 00:47:30,985
Come here, Miguel.

705
00:47:30,986 --> 00:47:33,986
You and I are going to drink to
the memory of the great friend Mistral...

706
00:47:34,446 --> 00:47:36,445
and for your future and happiness.

707
00:47:36,446 --> 00:47:39,321
Thank you very much, father.
To your health.

708
00:47:39,322 --> 00:47:42,322
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

709
00:47:57,120 --> 00:48:00,120
Come in.

710
00:48:01,330 --> 00:48:03,289
I have just heard the great news,

711
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:06,290
Congratulations, I hope we
celebrate it as it deserves.

712
00:48:06,415 --> 00:48:08,498
Rita, please. I'm busy.

713
00:48:08,499 --> 00:48:11,499
You jerk, you used to say
beautiful things about my lips.

714
00:48:12,001 --> 00:48:15,001
Could it be on account
of the little doctor you go out with?

715
00:48:15,168 --> 00:48:17,669
I don't like to hear nonsense,
forgive me.

716
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:20,169
What's the matter with you?

717
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:22,587
I came to hug you because I heard
you received an inheritance...

718
00:48:22,588 --> 00:48:24,586
and you treat me like this?

719
00:48:24,587 --> 00:48:27,587
-I haven't inherited anything.
-Then it's all a joke?

720
00:48:28,881 --> 00:48:31,048
My brother Miguel
is the one who inherited it.

721
00:48:31,049 --> 00:48:34,049
-Excuse me. Anyway I'm happy.
-Not more than I.

722
00:48:34,676 --> 00:48:37,551
I can imagine. Some crazy aunt.

723
00:48:37,552 --> 00:48:40,552
No, if you really must know,
it was an old friend of our parents...

724
00:48:41,718 --> 00:48:44,718
who without even knowing him,
left him more than a million pesos.

725
00:48:44,804 --> 00:48:47,804
Just like in the movies.
And nothing for you?

726
00:48:48,471 --> 00:48:50,013
Nothing.

727
00:48:50,014 --> 00:48:52,346
That's strange.

728
00:48:52,347 --> 00:48:54,347
I don't think it's strange at all.

729
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:56,682
Each one is free to leave
his money to whomever he pleases.

730
00:48:56,683 --> 00:48:59,683
Don't get mad, honey.
After all, you are the oldest and...

731
00:49:00,518 --> 00:49:02,517
-What?
-Nothing.

732
00:49:02,518 --> 00:49:05,060
But the reasonable thing
would have been to leave...

733
00:49:05,061 --> 00:49:06,726
the money to the two of you.

734
00:49:06,727 --> 00:49:09,727
Will you go away
and leave me alone?

735
00:49:11,813 --> 00:49:14,813
Carlos, I can understand your bad
mood, but I'm your friend...

736
00:49:15,856 --> 00:49:18,856
and I'm warning you this will create
a bad feeling among the staff.

737
00:49:20,692 --> 00:49:23,692
-What the hell do you mean?
-Careful, you're hurting me!

738
00:49:26,402 --> 00:49:29,068
You're very smart, little doctor.

739
00:49:29,069 --> 00:49:32,069
Give it a little thought
and you'll understand.

740
00:49:55,245 --> 00:49:57,036
Ah! Yes, yes, yes...

741
00:49:57,037 --> 00:49:59,537
As far as I'm concerned,
I'd rather prefer to be shot.

742
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:01,580
I believed it might prove
more dangerous.

743
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:02,705
I don't see why.

744
00:50:02,706 --> 00:50:05,539
Mom is right. The bullet
may only scratch you...

745
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:07,457
while the wine goes through
your stomach.

746
00:50:07,458 --> 00:50:10,458
-So what?
-Nothing.

747
00:50:10,875 --> 00:50:13,042
The wine only burns the stomach,

748
00:50:13,043 --> 00:50:16,043
messes up the nervous system
and slows the digestion.

749
00:50:17,377 --> 00:50:20,377
And at your age makes
you prone to apoplexy.

750
00:50:20,378 --> 00:50:22,378
It's true that you don't
take care of yourself.

751
00:50:22,379 --> 00:50:24,463
Today's doctors are all the same.

752
00:50:24,464 --> 00:50:27,464
Don't drink, don't eat,
don't smoke, don't dance.

753
00:50:27,673 --> 00:50:30,423
Well, you understand.
Foolishness.

754
00:50:30,424 --> 00:50:32,881
Well, do what you want.
I already warned you.

755
00:50:32,882 --> 00:50:35,882
Don't get mad, son.
You're nervous, irritable.

756
00:50:36,968 --> 00:50:39,926
You don't want to spoil your
brother's party do you?

757
00:50:39,927 --> 00:50:42,218
Of course not, mother.

758
00:50:42,219 --> 00:50:44,219
Let's celebrate the return
of the prodigal son...

759
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:45,553
who didn't go on a trip.

760
00:50:45,554 --> 00:50:47,387
I'll drink to Miguel's health.

761
00:50:47,388 --> 00:50:50,388
Rigor in my father's prescription
and benevolence in your colleague.

762
00:50:51,389 --> 00:50:54,389
-Very nice.
-That's the truth.

763
00:50:54,932 --> 00:50:57,474
I have a license to prescribe
myself poison whenever I want.

764
00:50:57,475 --> 00:50:59,350
-What will Don Feliciano do?
-Wait, Carlos.

765
00:50:59,351 --> 00:51:01,600
One moment, please.

766
00:51:01,601 --> 00:51:04,601
Dear friends, we have gathered
here in great friendship...

767
00:51:06,854 --> 00:51:09,854
to celebrate the appearance
of reluctant lady luck to this home.

768
00:51:12,313 --> 00:51:15,313
I toast to our dear Miguel hoping
he will make good use...

769
00:51:15,982 --> 00:51:18,982
of the inheritance and that he
may live a long and happy life.

770
00:51:23,235 --> 00:51:26,235
Miguel, give me a drop before
the attending doctor returns.

771
00:51:26,902 --> 00:51:29,485
Aren't you going to reply
to Don Feliciano, Miguel?

772
00:51:29,486 --> 00:51:32,236
I'm grateful for your words,
but you already know...

773
00:51:32,237 --> 00:51:33,903
that speaking in public is not
one of my talents.

774
00:51:33,904 --> 00:51:36,904
-I thought we were among family.
-At last we heard your voice.

775
00:51:37,197 --> 00:51:40,197
We are indeed among relatives
and in a family that will soon...

776
00:51:40,407 --> 00:51:42,573
increase its wealth.

777
00:51:42,574 --> 00:51:45,281
Don't joke like that,
I don't like it.

778
00:51:45,282 --> 00:51:48,282
-Forgive me, mother.
-Silence, Miguel is going to talk.

779
00:51:51,744 --> 00:51:54,535
Above all, I want to thank
everybody for the good wishes...

780
00:51:54,536 --> 00:51:57,286
and sincerity you show me
and then announce that...

781
00:51:57,287 --> 00:52:00,287
I have decided to buy the house
in which Carlos and I...

782
00:52:00,788 --> 00:52:03,788
had decided to establish a clinic.
Tomorrow I'll sign the deed.

783
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:08,165
I want to do everything
as you wanted, Carlos.

784
00:52:08,166 --> 00:52:10,290
And just because I'm
the owner doesn't mean...

785
00:52:10,291 --> 00:52:13,291
you won't be the director.
After all, it was your idea.

786
00:52:16,085 --> 00:52:18,877
What do you say, Carlitos?

787
00:52:18,878 --> 00:52:21,878
I'm very sorry, Miguel,
but I can't accept your offer.

788
00:52:22,587 --> 00:52:25,587
It's not in my plans to accept charity,
and if some day I accomplish something...

789
00:52:27,422 --> 00:52:30,422
it must be through my own effort,
and not...

790
00:52:31,716 --> 00:52:34,716
-That's all.
-I didn't want to offend you. I'm sorry.

791
00:52:34,759 --> 00:52:37,759
You are free to accept or refuse
what your brother offers you.

792
00:52:38,594 --> 00:52:41,594
But you will apologize to him
and to all here for your rudeness.

793
00:52:44,678 --> 00:52:47,678
Don't forget that you're
still in my house.

794
00:52:48,597 --> 00:52:51,597
Forgive me everyone,
especially you, Miguel.

795
00:52:51,598 --> 00:52:54,598
I didn't mean to offend you.

796
00:53:03,977 --> 00:53:06,644
The conduct of that young man
has been deplorable,

797
00:53:06,645 --> 00:53:08,645
and I'm not about to tolerate it.

798
00:53:08,646 --> 00:53:11,646
He's young, his ambition was
the clinic and you spoiled it for him.

799
00:53:13,731 --> 00:53:15,647
It's natural that he should be hurt.

800
00:53:15,648 --> 00:53:18,648
And now you will side with him.
You know what I think?

801
00:53:19,275 --> 00:53:21,149
It hurts me very much
because he is my son,

802
00:53:21,150 --> 00:53:23,609
but he is jealous
of Miguel's inheritance.

803
00:53:23,610 --> 00:53:26,610
Don't say that. Remember
he graduated 5 years ago...

804
00:53:26,652 --> 00:53:29,485
and despite his efforts,
he's not been able to accomplish much.

805
00:53:29,486 --> 00:53:31,944
Besides, he knows Miguel wants
to share everything with him.

806
00:53:31,945 --> 00:53:34,319
Miguel is like me.
No wonder he's my son.

807
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:35,821
But that Carlos...

808
00:53:35,822 --> 00:53:38,822
I better go talk to him,
tell him a thing or two.

809
00:53:39,615 --> 00:53:41,281
No! Let me do it.

810
00:53:41,282 --> 00:53:43,782
We mothers know how
to handle these matters.

811
00:53:43,783 --> 00:53:46,783
And point out to him how
distasteful those outbursts are...

812
00:53:46,867 --> 00:53:49,659
in front of strangers,
and not to forbid me to drink.

813
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:52,660
I do what I please.
Am I not his father?

814
00:53:52,702 --> 00:53:55,702
Relax and sleep, Carlos.
I'll go to see him.

815
00:54:08,542 --> 00:54:10,208
Are you awake, son?

816
00:54:10,209 --> 00:54:13,168
Come in, mother.
What brings you here?

817
00:54:13,169 --> 00:54:16,169
I couldn't have slept without
saying goodnight to you.

818
00:54:18,295 --> 00:54:21,295
What's the matter, son?
Why are you in such a bad mood?

819
00:54:21,963 --> 00:54:24,547
It's nothing.

820
00:54:24,548 --> 00:54:27,130
Don't you think your mother
knows you well?

821
00:54:27,131 --> 00:54:30,131
You behaved badly during dinner.
What's the matter?

822
00:54:30,632 --> 00:54:33,632
I don't know. Nerves. My father
exasperates me so much sometimes.

823
00:54:35,009 --> 00:54:38,009
-I don't really know.
-Are you sure that's all?

824
00:54:39,761 --> 00:54:42,761
-You and your intuition, mother.
-Don't get mad at me.

825
00:54:45,012 --> 00:54:48,012
But I thought that since
your plans failed,

826
00:54:48,805 --> 00:54:51,056
and good fortune was on
your brother's side,

827
00:54:51,057 --> 00:54:53,473
without him even looking for  it,

828
00:54:53,474 --> 00:54:56,474
that had left you jealous.

829
00:54:56,516 --> 00:54:58,016
Me, jealous?

830
00:54:58,017 --> 00:54:59,809
You, my son.

831
00:54:59,810 --> 00:55:02,810
You're with your mother which is
like being with yourself.

832
00:55:04,227 --> 00:55:06,936
Tell me the truth.

833
00:55:06,937 --> 00:55:09,937
I think you're right, mother.
What a shame!

834
00:55:11,522 --> 00:55:14,522
Don't worry. That will pass
without leaving any trace.

835
00:55:15,273 --> 00:55:18,273
You'll see. In the meantime,
try to bury those bad thoughts.

836
00:55:22,818 --> 00:55:25,818
All my life I've wanted to be
someone, above all, for you.

837
00:55:27,319 --> 00:55:28,943
Miguel is my brother,

838
00:55:28,944 --> 00:55:31,361
but for him the career
is nothing but an ornament.

839
00:55:31,362 --> 00:55:33,571
To me, research,
experimentation,

840
00:55:33,572 --> 00:55:36,029
discovery is the great
ambition ofmy life.

841
00:55:36,030 --> 00:55:39,030
You see. I lack the means.
Is that fair, mother?

842
00:55:42,116 --> 00:55:45,116
It's useless to revolt against
what's already done.

843
00:55:45,241 --> 00:55:47,158
But don't get depressed.

844
00:55:47,159 --> 00:55:49,784
Continue as you have up to now.
Have faith.

845
00:55:49,785 --> 00:55:52,493
In good fortune.

846
00:55:52,494 --> 00:55:53,993
In everything.

847
00:55:53,994 --> 00:55:56,119
In me,
who loves you so much.

848
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:59,120
In you, mother, yes. Yes.

849
00:56:02,165 --> 00:56:05,165
Good night, son. Sleep well.

850
00:58:33,301 --> 00:58:36,050
Carlos, I want to talk to you
for a moment.

851
00:58:36,051 --> 00:58:36,968
Tell me.

852
00:58:36,969 --> 00:58:39,260
Luisa is downstairs and we're meeting
mom to pick out furniture...

853
00:58:39,261 --> 00:58:40,677
for the new house.

854
00:58:40,678 --> 00:58:41,970
I would like you to join us.

855
00:58:41,971 --> 00:58:44,720
Are you crazy?
I'm on duty all day.

856
00:58:44,721 --> 00:58:47,721
-Manzano can cover for you.
-I don't like asking for favors.

857
00:58:47,847 --> 00:58:50,430
I'll go tomorrow.

858
00:58:50,431 --> 00:58:52,140
Didn't you want
to tell me something?

859
00:58:52,141 --> 00:58:54,556
Yes, I've been meaning
to ask you something.

860
00:58:54,557 --> 00:58:57,557
-I hope you understand and...
-What's it about?

861
00:58:59,226 --> 00:59:01,934
Are you in love with Luisa?

862
00:59:01,935 --> 00:59:04,935
Me? Where did you get
that idea?

863
00:59:05,311 --> 00:59:07,020
I just thought so.

864
00:59:07,021 --> 00:59:08,687
I wanted to ask you because...

865
00:59:08,688 --> 00:59:10,729
I do love her.

866
00:59:10,730 --> 00:59:13,397
-Well, tell her, not me.
-I already did.

867
00:59:13,398 --> 00:59:15,856
-And she accepted.
-How do you know?

868
00:59:15,857 --> 00:59:17,982
And how else could it be?

869
00:59:17,983 --> 00:59:20,608
You're a distinguished,
charming young man,

870
00:59:20,609 --> 00:59:22,400
and above all very rich.

871
00:59:22,401 --> 00:59:25,317
You're pulling my leg, Carlos.
I'm serious. I love her.

872
00:59:25,318 --> 00:59:28,318
But I also came to tell you that
if you love her, as I think you do,

873
00:59:29,237 --> 00:59:31,069
I'll leave the coast clear for you.

874
00:59:31,070 --> 00:59:33,904
A little late for that,
and besides, it's unnecessary.

875
00:59:33,905 --> 00:59:36,155
Anyway, thank you, Miguel.

876
00:59:36,156 --> 00:59:39,156
She must have said she's very
interested in her career,

877
00:59:39,241 --> 00:59:42,241
that she's very fond of me
since I was her teacher, etc...

878
00:59:43,075 --> 00:59:45,199
-But that's about it.
-And you?

879
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,534
Me?

880
00:59:47,535 --> 00:59:50,535
I'm going to wash my hands.

881
00:59:51,411 --> 00:59:53,702
Thank you, buddy.
See you tomorrow.

882
00:59:53,703 --> 00:59:56,703
See you tomorrow.

883
01:00:11,710 --> 01:00:13,126
What are you doing here?

884
01:00:13,127 --> 01:00:15,502
I was waiting for your brother
to leave to talk to you.

885
01:00:15,503 --> 01:00:18,170
You too? And in the meantime
your patient is neglected.

886
01:00:18,171 --> 01:00:19,961
What do you want?

887
01:00:19,962 --> 01:00:21,461
Let go!

888
01:00:21,462 --> 01:00:24,462
Do I have to call you "doctor" and treat you formally?

889
01:00:26,132 --> 01:00:28,339
You must hear me out.

890
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:31,340
Lately I've been thinking about
how you enjoyed talking to me.

891
01:00:33,301 --> 01:00:36,301
Remember how you used to take me
to the movies and to dinner?

892
01:00:37,052 --> 01:00:39,260
Why did you change so much?

893
01:00:39,261 --> 01:00:42,261
-You used to always come for me.
-I needed to kill time.

894
01:00:43,388 --> 01:00:46,388
At least when there are no patients.

895
01:00:46,722 --> 01:00:49,722
Seriously, you are always
in a bad mood, upset...

896
01:00:50,723 --> 01:00:53,723
I know what it is,
but I want to help you forget.

897
01:00:54,684 --> 01:00:57,684
Carlos, why don't you take me
dancing on Saturday?

898
01:00:58,268 --> 01:01:01,018
-We could talk then.
-Are you insane?

899
01:01:01,019 --> 01:01:04,019
You think I'll stroll around
with a... nurse?

900
01:01:04,937 --> 01:01:07,937
You'd be embarrassed?!
Men are so odd. Really!

901
01:01:09,271 --> 01:01:11,563
What should embarrass them
doesn't and...

902
01:01:11,564 --> 01:01:13,940
-What do you mean?
-I know what I mean.

903
01:01:13,941 --> 01:01:15,272
You're not leaving
without telling me.

904
01:01:15,273 --> 01:01:18,273
Don't touch me!
Although I'm "just" a nurse,

905
01:01:18,608 --> 01:01:20,483
I wouldn't have been embarrassed
going out with you.

906
01:01:20,484 --> 01:01:22,568
Tell me what you have to say.

907
01:01:22,569 --> 01:01:25,568
Don't think I'm jealous
of the lady doctor.

908
01:01:25,569 --> 01:01:28,027
Everyone knows she's going out
with your rich brother.

909
01:01:28,028 --> 01:01:30,403
What are you insinuating?

910
01:01:30,404 --> 01:01:33,404
You should never offend a woman,
not even a nurse,

911
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:36,947
when you're your mother's son.

912
01:01:36,948 --> 01:01:39,864
Take that back or I'll...

913
01:01:39,865 --> 01:01:41,199
What do you mean?

914
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:44,200
You must be blind
or desperate for money...

915
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:47,951
to not see why your brother
inherited the money.

916
01:01:48,369 --> 01:01:51,369
Bitch.

917
01:01:51,954 --> 01:01:54,954
If you don't let go of me
I'll scream.

918
01:01:56,746 --> 01:01:59,746
Until never, little doctor.

919
01:03:51,078 --> 01:03:53,161
-What's the matter, Carlos?
-Nothing.

920
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:56,162
-Why did you leave so abruptly?
-I said it's nothing.

921
01:03:57,163 --> 01:04:00,163
-Anything else?
-Nothing. Sleep well, son.

922
01:04:33,635 --> 01:04:36,009
When will the house be ready?

923
01:04:36,010 --> 01:04:39,010
I'm taking care of it, father.
I'll go there right after breakfast.

924
01:04:39,637 --> 01:04:42,637
The decorators promised it will
all be ready tomorrow.

925
01:04:45,472 --> 01:04:48,472
-Good morning, son.
-Good for some people.

926
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:50,681
I can wait for you to get dressed.

927
01:04:50,682 --> 01:04:53,181
I'd like you to come with me
to see your new office.

928
01:04:53,182 --> 01:04:55,182
I have a surprise for you.

929
01:04:55,183 --> 01:04:57,392
You're very kind
and I'm very grateful,

930
01:04:57,393 --> 01:04:59,642
but I don't think
I'll be able to use it.

931
01:04:59,643 --> 01:05:02,643
-What? Didn't we agree...
-I'm thinking of leaving Mexico soon.

932
01:05:04,187 --> 01:05:07,187
Without telling us, son?
Where to?

933
01:05:07,562 --> 01:05:08,646
To the Tropics.

934
01:05:08,647 --> 01:05:11,647
To the Tropics?
What are you talking about?

935
01:05:11,856 --> 01:05:14,856
To the Tropics outside of Mexico.
I want to do some research.

936
01:05:15,232 --> 01:05:16,898
If my request is granted
it will be very soon.

937
01:05:16,899 --> 01:05:18,566
Well, I'll be damned.

938
01:05:18,567 --> 01:05:21,025
Your brother wanted to help you
get established alongside him.

939
01:05:21,026 --> 01:05:24,026
I know Miguel is wonderful
and I'm very grateful.

940
01:05:24,652 --> 01:05:27,652
Worthy heir to such a generous
man as Mr. Mistral.

941
01:05:30,404 --> 01:05:33,404
By the way, it's strange that although
he was favored so magnificently...

942
01:05:35,197 --> 01:05:38,197
by our parents' friend, he has shown
no interest in seeing his face.

943
01:05:41,450 --> 01:05:44,159
You're right,
I hadn't thought of that.

944
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:46,200
Now that you mention it,
I would like that.

945
01:05:46,201 --> 01:05:49,201
Surely there must be a picture of him
around the house.

946
01:05:49,995 --> 01:05:52,828
Right, mother?

947
01:05:52,829 --> 01:05:55,829
I don't think so.
It's been so long that...

948
01:05:55,914 --> 01:05:58,497
Yes, there is a picture.

949
01:05:58,498 --> 01:06:01,498
I saw it recently, the day you were
cleaning out the hallway chest.

950
01:06:02,832 --> 01:06:05,832
Your benefactor gave it to us because
I told him he looked like a movie star.

951
01:06:09,168 --> 01:06:12,168
I hope you find it so Miguel can
put it in a gold frame at his clinic.

952
01:06:14,086 --> 01:06:17,086
Go get it. Miguel would like to know
the face of his benefactor.

953
01:06:21,714 --> 01:06:24,172
Mistral was kind and courteous.

954
01:06:24,173 --> 01:06:27,173
All your gratitude is not enough,
Miguel, because he could have...

955
01:06:27,341 --> 01:06:29,799
just as well left the money
for Carlos or myself.

956
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:31,883
He never met me,
so I can't understand why.

957
01:06:31,884 --> 01:06:34,551
Actually, he did meet you.

958
01:06:34,552 --> 01:06:37,552
We mailed him a card
regarding your baptism,

959
01:06:38,344 --> 01:06:40,386
and later on your picture.

960
01:06:40,387 --> 01:06:43,387
I believe it was the one
of your first communion.

961
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:48,680
Here you are.

962
01:06:48,890 --> 01:06:50,722
He was not bad looking.

963
01:06:50,723 --> 01:06:53,723
Distinguished, young...
Younger than you, right, dad?

964
01:06:53,934 --> 01:06:56,934
Yes, fifteen years younger.
I don't know why he never married.

965
01:06:58,393 --> 01:07:01,393
He always mentioned how much
he wanted a family.

966
01:07:03,062 --> 01:07:05,395
Why are you standing?
Sit down.

967
01:07:05,396 --> 01:07:07,020
I'm going to my room.

968
01:07:07,021 --> 01:07:10,021
So many long faces.
And what's the matter with you?

969
01:07:10,523 --> 01:07:13,523
Nothing. Talking about a dead man
reminds me of the troubles of life.

970
01:07:14,816 --> 01:07:17,816
Ever since the inheritance,
you seem to be mourning someone.

971
01:07:21,401 --> 01:07:22,943
I am mourning someone.

972
01:07:22,944 --> 01:07:25,943
-I bet it's a woman.
-Yes, a woman.

973
01:07:25,945 --> 01:07:28,111
Did you break up with her?

974
01:07:28,112 --> 01:07:31,112
Worse even.
She died in my heart.

975
01:07:31,197 --> 01:07:33,612
But there's really no reason
to be sad.

976
01:07:33,613 --> 01:07:36,613
She was not worthy.

977
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:41,908
Rosario!

978
01:07:41,909 --> 01:07:44,909
What is it, dear?
What is it?

979
01:07:45,034 --> 01:07:47,493
Let's get her something, fast.

980
01:07:47,494 --> 01:07:50,411
Carlos, what are you doing there?
Hurry up.

981
01:07:50,412 --> 01:07:53,412
Her pulse is weak.
What do you think it is?

982
01:07:53,620 --> 01:07:56,620
Prescribe her a sedative.
Something mild.

983
01:07:56,705 --> 01:07:59,664
-What's wrong with her?
-Nothing serious.

984
01:07:59,665 --> 01:08:02,665
And don't be concerned, she'll probably
have quite a few more of those.

985
01:08:05,208 --> 01:08:08,041
Mom, calm down.

986
01:08:08,042 --> 01:08:11,042
It was nothing,
you'll be fine soon.

987
01:08:12,336 --> 01:08:15,294
But...

988
01:08:15,295 --> 01:08:18,295
More. More. There.

989
01:08:18,380 --> 01:08:20,088
That's perfect, don't you think?

990
01:08:20,089 --> 01:08:23,089
I agree, but do you think the clinic's
success depends on this table?

991
01:08:24,548 --> 01:08:27,548
Don't make fun of me.
Little things go a long way.

992
01:08:29,425 --> 01:08:32,133
-What do you think?
-What a house!

993
01:08:32,134 --> 01:08:34,093
And what a great business.

994
01:08:34,094 --> 01:08:37,094
You took the best
Spanish chest I had.

995
01:08:38,095 --> 01:08:39,845
You have good taste.

996
01:08:39,846 --> 01:08:42,846
The clinic is fabulous.
A real treasure.

997
01:08:43,805 --> 01:08:46,430
And what does the critic say?

998
01:08:46,431 --> 01:08:49,431
I'm convinced. Yes.
It's not bad.

999
01:08:49,474 --> 01:08:51,474
Don't trust him, Miguel.
He's a joker.

1000
01:08:51,475 --> 01:08:54,475
I'm leaving. I have a lot of work.
We'll see each other at dinner time.

1001
01:09:04,230 --> 01:09:06,187
What's the matter, father?

1002
01:09:06,188 --> 01:09:09,188
Nothing. Just some shortness
of breath once in a while.

1003
01:09:09,731 --> 01:09:12,731
"Don't blame anyone for my death",
said... whoever said it.

1004
01:09:14,898 --> 01:09:17,898
It's no one's fault I run around
all day Iong.

1005
01:09:19,067 --> 01:09:21,567
-Be careful.
-We'll walk you to the garden.

1006
01:09:21,568 --> 01:09:24,568
Let's go.

1007
01:09:27,070 --> 01:09:30,070
-How funny, how womanly.
-What?

1008
01:09:30,113 --> 01:09:33,113
Luisa. She feels she owns the house,
the owner, and the one million pesos.

1009
01:09:37,991 --> 01:09:40,991
Women are so sentimental
and indifferent.

1010
01:09:41,075 --> 01:09:44,075
Don't say  that about Luisa,
she's not like that.

1011
01:09:44,493 --> 01:09:47,493
-She has her own money, a career...
-You would defend her.

1012
01:09:47,744 --> 01:09:50,744
One never sees his mother as a woman,
but when you do...

1013
01:09:51,328 --> 01:09:54,328
you can find out surprising things.

1014
01:09:55,663 --> 01:09:57,663
You know what I'm thinking?

1015
01:09:57,664 --> 01:09:59,872
You defend Luisa, because
you would have done...

1016
01:09:59,873 --> 01:10:02,831
exactly the same thing.

1017
01:10:02,832 --> 01:10:04,957
How can you say that?

1018
01:10:04,958 --> 01:10:07,958
Howcan you even think that?

1019
01:10:10,252 --> 01:10:13,086
And you even laugh.
You're crazy!

1020
01:10:13,087 --> 01:10:16,087
I'm having fun and learning.
Look.

1021
01:10:20,339 --> 01:10:23,172
That kiss will cost Miguel
a million pesos.

1022
01:10:23,173 --> 01:10:24,881
I won't let you say that.

1023
01:10:24,882 --> 01:10:27,673
Luisa, is honesty in person
and you know it.

1024
01:10:27,674 --> 01:10:30,674
Yes, she personifies
the honesty of all women.

1025
01:10:33,969 --> 01:10:36,969
Interesting dilemma
proving a woman can be honest.

1026
01:10:38,095 --> 01:10:40,219
Very honest and still
cheat on her husband.

1027
01:10:40,220 --> 01:10:43,220
She will do it, and she won't
be the first or the last one.

1028
01:10:43,639 --> 01:10:45,555
You are so cruel!

1029
01:10:45,556 --> 01:10:48,556
You have no idea how cruel
and unfair you are being.

1030
01:10:53,226 --> 01:10:56,226
I'm sorry to say it, but I wasn't born
to be a husband, thank goodness!

1031
01:11:01,895 --> 01:11:03,936
What's the matter, mother.
Are you ill?

1032
01:11:03,937 --> 01:11:06,937
It's nothing. I'm just a bit dizzy again.
I'm fine now.

1033
01:11:07,022 --> 01:11:10,022
-Do you need anything?
-Don't worry. I'm fine.

1034
01:11:10,064 --> 01:11:12,523
-Are you sure?
-Sure, son.

1035
01:11:12,524 --> 01:11:15,524
Sit here, mother.

1036
01:11:19,735 --> 01:11:22,735
-Are you really feeling better?
-Yes, my son, I am.

1037
01:11:23,361 --> 01:11:26,361
Can you handle some good news?

1038
01:11:27,445 --> 01:11:29,529
-When is the wedding?
-You knew!

1039
01:11:29,530 --> 01:11:32,530
And you don't know how happy
I am.You'll be very happy.

1040
01:11:33,197 --> 01:11:36,197
-Really?
-Really.

1041
01:11:38,116 --> 01:11:41,116
Mother.

1042
01:12:32,927 --> 01:12:35,427
What an amazing ceremony!

1043
01:12:35,428 --> 01:12:38,428
I admit that when you put yourself to it,
you go all the way, my friend.

1044
01:12:40,263 --> 01:12:42,470
Yes, and it cost me a lot.

1045
01:12:42,471 --> 01:12:45,471
I didn't allow Miguel to pay
a cent for the banquet.

1046
01:12:46,306 --> 01:12:49,097
-Right, Miguelito?
-Be careful, Don Feliciano.

1047
01:12:49,098 --> 01:12:51,807
Starting today Luisa won't be
caring for you anymore.

1048
01:12:51,808 --> 01:12:54,808
-Right, Luisa?
-Let him eat. Today is a special day.

1049
01:12:56,310 --> 01:12:59,310
Look at your mother, she barely
even tasted the mushrooms.

1050
01:12:59,353 --> 01:13:02,102
Don't say that.
They served me too much.

1051
01:13:02,103 --> 01:13:04,353
-Are you happy?
-Immensely.

1052
01:13:04,354 --> 01:13:07,354
The day would be complete
if Carlos had come.

1053
01:13:13,441 --> 01:13:16,149
Here's to the couple!
Congratulations.

1054
01:13:16,150 --> 01:13:19,150
You show up now?

1055
01:13:19,193 --> 01:13:22,193
You think it's right to miss
your brother's wedding?

1056
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:24,652
I'm a busy doctor, father.

1057
01:13:24,653 --> 01:13:26,653
The kind that works for a living.

1058
01:13:26,654 --> 01:13:29,111
-Don't argue now.
-You're right.

1059
01:13:29,112 --> 01:13:30,821
I want to make a toast.
Is there a glass for me?

1060
01:13:30,822 --> 01:13:32,488
Let me have this one.

1061
01:13:32,489 --> 01:13:34,030
Cheers, Miguel.

1062
01:13:34,031 --> 01:13:35,822
Cheers, Luisa.

1063
01:13:35,823 --> 01:13:38,823
This toast is to the alliance of science,
beauty and wealth.

1064
01:13:42,492 --> 01:13:45,492
And also to women's fidelity.

1065
01:13:46,869 --> 01:13:49,869
If you told us the joke,
we would laugh with you.

1066
01:13:50,161 --> 01:13:53,161
There is nothing fairer,
Don Feliciano.

1067
01:13:53,496 --> 01:13:56,496
I'm also toasting
Dr. Carlos Montero Jimenez, that's me.

1068
01:13:58,665 --> 01:14:01,290
A member of the Institute
of Tropical Diseases,

1069
01:14:01,291 --> 01:14:04,291
who will soon leave on a trip
without honey nor moon.

1070
01:14:05,667 --> 01:14:08,667
-Congratulations, man.
-You got it?

1071
01:14:09,335 --> 01:14:12,210
I also congratulate you
if that's what you want.

1072
01:14:12,211 --> 01:14:13,878
Thank you, dear people.

1073
01:14:13,879 --> 01:14:16,879
Nobody can imagine how happy
a man can be without money,

1074
01:14:18,380 --> 01:14:21,214
without a wife, without the danger
of losing the wife,

1075
01:14:21,215 --> 01:14:24,215
of losing the money...

1076
01:14:24,548 --> 01:14:26,631
Carlos, you have been drinking.

1077
01:14:26,632 --> 01:14:29,632
Stop being impertinent and
sit down and eat something.

1078
01:14:30,676 --> 01:14:32,509
Yes, I drank a little.

1079
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:35,510
But you mustn't do it anymore.
I have warned you many times.

1080
01:14:36,345 --> 01:14:39,345
I propose a toast.

1081
01:14:39,637 --> 01:14:42,637
Luisa, Miguel, you have given me
the happiest day of my life.

1082
01:14:45,515 --> 01:14:47,973
A toast for my son Miguel who
is the one that has given me...

1083
01:14:47,974 --> 01:14:49,724
the most happiness.

1084
01:14:49,725 --> 01:14:52,725
He's rich, young, he has married
a marvelous girl,

1085
01:14:53,351 --> 01:14:55,308
and carries my name.

1086
01:14:55,309 --> 01:14:57,101
What more does one want?

1087
01:14:57,102 --> 01:15:00,102
And to toast them for
the happiness we are all here,

1088
01:15:00,144 --> 01:15:03,019
eating well, drinking even better,

1089
01:15:03,020 --> 01:15:06,020
because that's the reason
I spent my money.

1090
01:15:06,105 --> 01:15:09,105
Because if my son is splendid,
his father is more.

1091
01:15:12,108 --> 01:15:15,108
He's exactly like me.

1092
01:15:15,109 --> 01:15:18,109
He has all my qualities and none
of my faults, which are many.

1093
01:15:20,861 --> 01:15:23,861
And I toast to this son...

1094
01:15:26,028 --> 01:15:29,028
who today married
this angel, I...

1095
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:36,240
-Carlos!
-Father!

1096
01:15:38,157 --> 01:15:39,366
Excuse me.

1097
01:15:39,367 --> 01:15:42,367
Excuse me.

1098
01:15:54,998 --> 01:15:57,831
He's dead.

1099
01:15:57,832 --> 01:16:00,749
At least he died happy.

1100
01:16:00,750 --> 01:16:03,750
Death spared him from
many disappointments.

1101
01:16:44,973 --> 01:16:47,097
What's new, Carlos?
Leaving already?

1102
01:16:47,098 --> 01:16:48,515
The plane leaves at ten.

1103
01:16:48,516 --> 01:16:51,141
How's mother?
I think she needs a good rest.

1104
01:16:51,142 --> 01:16:52,600
It's not necessary.

1105
01:16:52,601 --> 01:16:54,767
Women have an incredible
amount of strength...

1106
01:16:54,768 --> 01:16:56,893
and great strength of character.

1107
01:16:56,894 --> 01:16:58,643
She has not shed one tear.

1108
01:16:58,644 --> 01:17:01,602
You know that people who don't
cry suffer the most.

1109
01:17:01,603 --> 01:17:03,020
That's what they say.

1110
01:17:03,021 --> 01:17:06,021
I'll go see her.

1111
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:16,400
Carlos, I know this is not
the best time,

1112
01:17:16,526 --> 01:17:19,067
but since you're leaving,
I want to clarify a matter with you.

1113
01:17:19,068 --> 01:17:20,442
Go ahead.

1114
01:17:20,443 --> 01:17:23,443
We haven't talked since that day
at the clinic when you asked me...

1115
01:17:24,319 --> 01:17:27,319
Who is thinking about that now?
You are Miguel's wife.

1116
01:17:27,362 --> 01:17:30,362
It's my fault for believing
you were different.

1117
01:17:30,697 --> 01:17:32,656
You're mistaken, Carlos.

1118
01:17:32,657 --> 01:17:35,657
When you told me about your love
I didn't want to hurt you...

1119
01:17:35,698 --> 01:17:38,698
but I've been in love with Miguel
since way back.

1120
01:17:41,076 --> 01:17:43,117
I'm sorry, but I don't believe you.

1121
01:17:43,118 --> 01:17:45,035
The inheritance
made you change course.

1122
01:17:45,036 --> 01:17:46,493
You're like all the rest.

1123
01:17:46,494 --> 01:17:49,494
Vulgar, ambitious and capable
of selling yourself for...

1124
01:17:52,580 --> 01:17:55,580
Poor guy. You're sick
with jealousy and envy.

1125
01:17:55,789 --> 01:17:58,789
Jealousy? Envy?
Of my brother the imbecile?

1126
01:17:59,581 --> 01:18:01,874
Of the good deal you've done?

1127
01:18:01,875 --> 01:18:04,875
What I feel is repulsion, contempt.

1128
01:18:11,921 --> 01:18:14,628
Luisa, where are you going?
What happened?

1129
01:18:14,629 --> 01:18:17,629
Ask your brother.
I'm going back home.

1130
01:18:28,426 --> 01:18:29,716
What did you say to Luisa?

1131
01:18:29,717 --> 01:18:32,592
To the doctor? I was telling her
about the vulgarity of women.

1132
01:18:32,593 --> 01:18:35,093
First of all, don't call her
doctor in that tone of voice.

1133
01:18:35,094 --> 01:18:36,428
She's my wife, Carlos.

1134
01:18:36,429 --> 01:18:38,969
That's right.
You were the purchaser.

1135
01:18:38,970 --> 01:18:41,262
I order you to take back
what you just said.

1136
01:18:41,263 --> 01:18:43,763
You, ordering me?

1137
01:18:43,764 --> 01:18:46,764
You're crazy.

1138
01:18:47,058 --> 01:18:48,807
You want me to tell you
what I think?

1139
01:18:48,808 --> 01:18:51,808
It breaks my soul to say it,
but you are jealous. Envious.

1140
01:18:52,935 --> 01:18:54,935
I'm ashamed to be your brother.

1141
01:18:54,936 --> 01:18:57,435
Jealousy, right?
Of your great talent.

1142
01:18:57,436 --> 01:19:00,269
Would you have been able to write
your thesis without me?

1143
01:19:00,270 --> 01:19:03,187
Or do you think I'm jealous
because you married Luisa?

1144
01:19:03,188 --> 01:19:06,188
With money you can
buy everything.

1145
01:19:06,772 --> 01:19:09,064
Then it's my money you envy?

1146
01:19:09,065 --> 01:19:12,065
-Since I received the inheritance
-You had to bring up the money?

1147
01:19:12,108 --> 01:19:14,524
Shut up or I won't be responsible
for my actions.

1148
01:19:14,525 --> 01:19:17,150
For weeks you
haven't been able to say...

1149
01:19:17,151 --> 01:19:19,693
one word to my mother,
my father, Luisa or me.

1150
01:19:19,694 --> 01:19:22,569
You cowardly torture mother...

1151
01:19:22,570 --> 01:19:24,694
as if she was responsible
for my inheritance,

1152
01:19:24,695 --> 01:19:26,529
and I will not shut up!

1153
01:19:26,530 --> 01:19:28,362
Besides, I'm going to order you
to respect me.

1154
01:19:28,363 --> 01:19:29,904
Respect you, idiot?

1155
01:19:29,905 --> 01:19:31,905
You who has dishonored
us with your inheritance?

1156
01:19:31,906 --> 01:19:33,488
What did you say? Repeat it!

1157
01:19:33,489 --> 01:19:35,406
I say one cannot accept
the fortune of a man...

1158
01:19:35,407 --> 01:19:36,782
when one claims
he's the son of another.

1159
01:19:36,783 --> 01:19:38,490
Are you mad?

1160
01:19:38,491 --> 01:19:40,950
You're the son of the man
who left you his fortune.

1161
01:19:40,951 --> 01:19:43,284
You're not an honest man,
because an honest man,

1162
01:19:43,285 --> 01:19:45,618
doesn't accept the money
that stains one's mother.

1163
01:19:45,619 --> 01:19:48,619
Bastard!

1164
01:19:49,954 --> 01:19:52,620
If you come close, I'll...
Why did you make me tell you?

1165
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:54,287
You should have kept quiet.

1166
01:19:54,288 --> 01:19:55,788
How can you say
that about mother?

1167
01:19:55,789 --> 01:19:56,956
How could you know?

1168
01:19:56,957 --> 01:19:59,957
The happy child. Pampered
and rich who never knew anything.

1169
01:20:01,041 --> 01:20:04,041
For many days I haven't slept,
eaten or known what I'm doing...

1170
01:20:04,125 --> 01:20:06,334
or what I'm saying because
I'm oppressed by shame and pain.

1171
01:20:06,335 --> 01:20:09,335
And my mother...

1172
01:20:20,715 --> 01:20:23,715
I should never
have told you anything.

1173
01:20:24,507 --> 01:20:26,675
Say it again to my face
or I'll kill you.

1174
01:20:26,676 --> 01:20:29,217
No, Miguel, no.

1175
01:20:29,218 --> 01:20:31,592
Tell me it isn't true, mother.
Tell me.

1176
01:20:31,593 --> 01:20:34,344
It's true Miguel.
Carlos told the truth.

1177
01:20:34,345 --> 01:20:35,844
No, it's not possible.

1178
01:20:35,845 --> 01:20:38,845
Yes, Miguel. The man who left
you that fortune was your father.

1179
01:20:39,471 --> 01:20:41,387
The only man I ever loved.

1180
01:20:41,388 --> 01:20:44,388
Then it's true.
You betrayed me, him and all.

1181
01:20:46,140 --> 01:20:49,140
I can say it.
You betrayed my father.

1182
01:20:49,225 --> 01:20:52,225
You have covered us with shame.

1183
01:20:52,976 --> 01:20:55,309
I will not allow you to insult me.

1184
01:20:55,310 --> 01:20:58,310
Mine was not a shameful affair,
only an impossible union.

1185
01:20:59,519 --> 01:21:02,519
In order not to abandon you
or your father who was sick,

1186
01:21:03,187 --> 01:21:05,480
I didn't go away
to live with him forever.

1187
01:21:05,481 --> 01:21:07,313
I don't ask you for forgiveness.

1188
01:21:07,314 --> 01:21:10,314
I'm not ashamed of those moments
of happiness an tenderness.

1189
01:21:10,441 --> 01:21:13,441
Nothing can pay for them
in this world.

1190
01:21:13,816 --> 01:21:16,608
To me, he was my real husband,

1191
01:21:16,609 --> 01:21:19,609
and that society in front of which
I have covered you with shame...

1192
01:21:19,777 --> 01:21:22,777
was the one that sacrificed
my life and my love.

1193
01:21:23,070 --> 01:21:25,903
Don't you feel shame either,

1194
01:21:25,904 --> 01:21:28,904
just as I do not feel it
for having loved your father.

1195
01:21:30,322 --> 01:21:33,322
Together with you two, he was
the only good thing life has given me.

1196
01:21:34,907 --> 01:21:37,907
My only love. Even today, being
dead, he is still alive in my heart.

1197
01:21:42,744 --> 01:21:44,743
Now you know everything.

1198
01:21:44,744 --> 01:21:47,744
If you're ashamed of me,
leave this house!

1199
01:21:54,664 --> 01:21:57,664
Forgive me, mother.
I'm the least likely to judge you.

1200
01:21:58,207 --> 01:22:00,582
Forgive me.

1201
01:22:00,583 --> 01:22:03,583
Come and live with us, mother,
with Luisa and myself.

1202
01:22:03,917 --> 01:22:06,917
Please say yes. I'll do whatever
possible to make you happy.

1203
01:22:07,128 --> 01:22:10,128
No, son. Leave me here
with my memories.

1204
01:22:11,211 --> 01:22:13,837
I'll be happy if you are happy.

1205
01:22:13,838 --> 01:22:16,838
You will always have me here
to hold you in my arms.

1206
01:22:22,465 --> 01:22:25,008
Forgive me too, mother.

1207
01:22:25,009 --> 01:22:28,009
I don't know what to say,
but I don't want to go,

1208
01:22:28,342 --> 01:22:29,842
leaving you like this.

1209
01:22:29,843 --> 01:22:32,135
-I'll stay here with you and...
-No, son.

1210
01:22:32,136 --> 01:22:35,136
I appear guiltier in your eyes.

1211
01:22:36,012 --> 01:22:39,012
You would again look at me,
like you have been doing lately.

1212
01:22:39,096 --> 01:22:41,429
I don't hold any grudge.

1213
01:22:41,430 --> 01:22:44,430
I'm your mother and I understand
you have suffered.

1214
01:22:45,766 --> 01:22:48,766
Go away, son,
and may God bless you.

1215
01:23:00,146 --> 01:23:03,146
Goodbye, mother.

1216
01:23:03,397 --> 01:23:06,397
I'll write to you.

1217
01:23:09,190 --> 01:23:12,190
Mother, tell me we'll see
each other every day.

1218
01:23:12,691 --> 01:23:14,441
If you need anything
you'll ask me for it.

1219
01:23:14,442 --> 01:23:17,442
Leave me alone now.
I need to be alone and rest.

1220
01:23:43,994 --> 01:23:45,618
Goodbye, Miguel.

1221
01:23:45,619 --> 01:23:47,619
I'm going to be away
for a long time...

1222
01:23:47,620 --> 01:23:49,912
and I hope you
don't hold any grudge.

1223
01:23:49,913 --> 01:23:52,913
You can leave in peace.
