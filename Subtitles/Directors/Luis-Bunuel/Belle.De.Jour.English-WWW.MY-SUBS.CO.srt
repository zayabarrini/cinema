1
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:35,624
Shall I tell you a secret, Severine?

2
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,707
I love you more every day.

3
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:41,457
So do I, Pierre.

4
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:43,540
You're everything to me,

5
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:45,915
but...
- But what?

6
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,165
I, too, wish
it could be perfect.

7
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,290
- If only you were less cold.
- Oh, please, Pierre!

8
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,207
I didn't mean to annoy you...

9
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:58,874
You know how fond I am of you.

10
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:01,249
What good is it to me?

11
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,707
How unkind you can be sometimes!

12
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:08,332
I'm sorry.

13
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:16,707
Stop!

14
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,457
Get out!

15
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,040
Why?

16
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,540
Get out, I said!

17
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:32,040
Why?

18
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:34,457
- Come on.
- Leave me alone!

19
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:41,832
Do as I said.

20
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:52,415
How dare you?

21
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:54,165
Let go of me!

22
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:57,582
You brutes!

23
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,124
It's not my fault.

24
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:05,290
I'll explain!

25
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:10,165
Don't be afraid to hurt
this little tart.

26
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,040
- Hurry up!
- Pierre, it's your fault too.

27
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:15,249
I can explain everything.

28
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:18,665
Shut your mouth, Madame...
or I'll shut it for you.

29
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:27,999
Stop it!

30
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:31,332
Tell them to let me go!

31
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:38,707
Help!

32
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:40,832
Shut up, slut!

33
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,665
Come on!

34
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:51,582
Pull her up!

35
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:58,290
If you scream, I'll kill you.

36
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:01,249
Pierre, please...

37
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:03,207
I'm sorry.

38
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:05,499
Deeply sorry.

39
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,832
I beg of you,
don't let the cats loose!

40
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:41,082
That's enough.

41
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:44,207
- She's all yours.
- I love you, Pierre.

42
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:57,415
Severine,
what are you thinking about?

43
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,415
Tell me...

44
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:06,374
About you...

45
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:08,207
about us.

46
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,040
We were driving in a coach.

47
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,124
That coach again?

48
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:22,457
I want to kiss you.

49
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,540
You have to get up early.

50
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:31,540
- Why?
- To pack our bags.

51
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:33,874
Where are we going?

52
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:36,457
It's a surprise for our anniversary.

53
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:39,540
We've been happily married
for a year now.

54
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:42,749
- May the sun always shine on us!
- What about the hospital?

55
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:45,207
I want to forget it
for a few days...

56
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:47,082
and think only of you.

57
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:55,332
- Happy?
- Yes...

58
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,582
especially when you're here.
I want you with me every minute.

59
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:16,665
No, please!

60
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:19,790
Sleep well!

61
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,874
Forgive me...

62
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,665
You're so kind, so understanding.

63
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:45,040
- But I...
- It's nothing.

64
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:47,124
Go to sleep.

65
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:59,874
Are you coming to the party?

66
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:02,415
I don't know.
Husson turns in early.

67
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:06,249
Let him sleep and come with us.
They said it'll snow later.

68
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:08,332
I'd rather see the mesmerizer.

69
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,082
- He does wonders.
- I wouldn't be put to sleep.

70
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:14,874
Mesmerizers are not hypnotists.
They cause sunrises.

71
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:18,374
A hypnotist plunges you
into darkness.

72
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,790
Well, I'm off. See you later.

73
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,707
What time is it?

74
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:38,165
Five o'clock.
If you're bored, you can go.

75
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,124
One is never bored in a bar.

76
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:43,457
Not like in a church...
where you're alone with your soul.

77
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:47,249
I'll tell you something pleasant.

78
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:49,832
I love you.

79
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:53,582
Your scars heal wonderfully!

80
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,165
You bore me!

81
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:06,415
- Let's not go. She's with Husson.
- Too late. He's seen us.

82
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:09,290
What have you got against him?
He's interesting.

83
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:11,915
Think so? I don't like his looks.

84
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:13,457
Come on.

85
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,707
I saw you passing,

86
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,707
arm in arm.

87
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:35,790
Just like newly-weds.

88
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:37,332
Ridiculous, perhaps?

89
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,915
Not at all. Reassuring
in an everyday sort of way.

90
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:45,999
And yet, Pierre,
you sometimes make me feel guilty.

91
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:48,457
We are so different.

92
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:51,249
Men like you are rare.

93
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,207
Sincerely.

94
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:57,582
Oh... Thank you.

95
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:09,707
What punishments I am missing!

96
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,999
Why? Do you know them?

97
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:14,124
Is that all you care for?

98
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:16,874
All the rest's a waste of time.

99
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:20,207
Maybe you should see a psychiatrist.

100
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:23,832
Rich and idle,
his two main diseases.

101
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:25,707
And hunting...

102
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:29,290
Also, I'm particularly fond
of the working class.

103
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:33,124
I think of them when it snows,
with no furs, no hope, no nothing.

104
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:34,957
You're very attractive, Severine.

105
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:37,374
Your compliments are too subtle.
Be quiet.

106
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:38,999
Impossible!

107
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:42,540
I'm leaving you now.
Got a headache.

108
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,790
- Is it cold out?
- No.

109
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:47,499
I'll get some fresh air.
See you later, Renée.

110
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,749
- See you later.
- Enjoy your walk.

111
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:56,582
I like him. He's amusing.

112
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:58,415
He's strange.

113
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,374
Worse than that...

114
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:24,249
- I forgot to ask about Husson.
- He's well.

115
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:27,290
- You still see him?
- Yes, unfortunately.

116
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:29,374
Remember Henriette?

117
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:30,957
Yes.

118
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,082
They say...

119
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,374
They say she works in a brothel...

120
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:41,249
They say it's absolutely definite.
Several times a week.

121
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:44,457
Henriette of all people!

122
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,415
You're so innocent.

123
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,499
Imagine.

124
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:52,457
A woman like us.

125
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:55,499
Going with anybody!

126
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:58,332
In those places,
one has no choice.

127
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,999
Young and old, ugly and handsome...

128
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:03,540
Even with someone you love...

129
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:05,499
it's not always pleasant.

130
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:09,499
With strangers it must be horrible.
Do those places still exist?

131
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,415
Excuse me, ladies...

132
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:16,082
They exist, I can promise you that.

133
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,832
But not like the pre-war days.

134
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,624
No more red lights.

135
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:26,374
Believe me, plenty of customers.

136
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,582
I could show you half a dozen.

137
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:31,165
It's part of my job.

138
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:34,999
Been driving a cab for 20 years
and I've seen all sorts.

139
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:39,207
I was even beaten up twice.
It didn't do me any harm.

140
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:44,832
What's the matter with you?

141
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,624
We're nearly there.

142
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,457
These flowers came for you, Madame.

143
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:27,082
- Who sent them?
- M. Husson.

144
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,790
Why did you put them here?

145
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,624
I'll go and get a cloth.

146
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:52,790
It won't make a mark.
It was fresh water.

147
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:23,665
What's the matter with me today?

148
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:25,665
<i>Come here, Severine!</i>

149
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:34,082
<i>Severine, are you coming or not?</i>

150
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:46,874
Have you much more to do?

151
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:48,915
Nearly finished.

152
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,999
May I ask a silly question?

153
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,082
Go right ahead.

154
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,332
Before you met me...

155
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,374
did you often go to...
"houses"?

156
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,832
"Houses"?

157
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:22,332
Not often. Why?
Are you interested?

158
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,749
Everything about you interests me.

159
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:28,457
I thought they'd been closed.

160
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:30,665
They're undercover now.

161
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,915
I can't imagine what it's like.

162
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:35,665
Listen, I've got work to do.

163
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,457
Please...

164
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:42,957
Well, you go in.

165
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:46,582
You choose a woman.
You spend half an hour with her.

166
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,082
And you're depressed all day.

167
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,165
That's how it is...

168
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:55,582
- "Semen retentum venenum est."
- Stop it!

169
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:58,707
I don't want to hear any more.

170
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:01,999
What's the matter?

171
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:08,790
I've never seen you like this.
What's wrong?

172
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:11,499
I'm a little tired and on edge.

173
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:13,790
Go and rest.

174
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:15,457
Yes, you're right.

175
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:17,790
Goodnight.

176
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,540
- Shall I come with you?
- No!

177
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:24,665
Yes, stay until I go to sleep.

178
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:29,582
Won't you ever grow up?

179
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,999
I can't hit a thing.
Take my place.

180
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:55,082
- Are you going?
- I'll wait for you inside.

181
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,874
- How are you?
- All right.

182
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:11,165
- You don't come here much any more.
- No.

183
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:12,749
See you later.

184
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:21,040
The mysterious Henriette!

185
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,540
The woman with two sides to her.

186
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:30,707
A double life.
It's very interesting.

187
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:32,665
Renée told you?

188
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:34,457
But why?

189
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:36,665
For money... that's all.

190
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:40,790
Nearly all women who seek revenge
do it for money.

191
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:46,707
I'm very glad to see you.

192
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:48,540
I don't understand them.

193
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:51,040
It's the oldest job
in the world.

194
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:55,665
Nowadays it's done by phone.
Women who go to "houses" are rarer.

195
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:57,999
You should know.

196
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:01,915
Yes, I used to go often.

197
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:05,540
I like the atmosphere.
Women completely enslaved.

198
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:08,499
There was one near the Opera.

199
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:11,207
But especially Madame Anaïs.

200
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:14,915
11, Cité Jean de Saumur.
A very fond memory.

201
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,165
Are you mad?

202
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:20,082
It's nothing. "Cute compulsion"
as the English say.

203
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,749
Insignificant impulses.

204
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:26,707
One day, I want to be with you
without your husband.

205
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:30,249
I like Pierre,
but I'd rather him not be there.

206
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:43,124
<i>Madame Anaïs,</i>
<i>11, Cité Jean de Saumur.</i>

207
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,957
<i>Madame Anaïs</i>
<i>Fashions</i>

208
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:31,207
What's the matter?

209
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:11,499
- What do you want?
- I'd like to speak to you.

210
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:20,124
Is it you who...?

211
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:22,124
I am Madame Anaïs.

212
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:24,915
I'd like to find out if...

213
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:27,540
Come. Let's have a talk.

214
00:22:33,958 --> 00:22:35,290
Sit down.

215
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:38,082
- May I offer you a drink?
- No, thanks.

216
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,707
- Cigarette?
- No, thank you. I don't smoke.

217
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:44,207
Don't be afraid.
Make yourself at home.

218
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:47,374
I think I can help you.
Sit down.

219
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:52,999
You're charming and fresh.

220
00:22:53,166 --> 00:22:55,207
Just what they like...

221
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:57,999
It's difficult at the start but...

222
00:22:58,166 --> 00:23:00,540
when somebody needs money...

223
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:04,915
We go fifty-fifty.

224
00:23:05,958 --> 00:23:07,749
I have certain expenses.

225
00:23:07,916 --> 00:23:10,707
Thank you. But I must go.

226
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:14,124
You're a little upset.

227
00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:19,332
It's the first time
you've worked?

228
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:21,874
It's not that bad.

229
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:25,332
The other girls aren't here yet.

230
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,374
You'll lose your button...

231
00:23:28,458 --> 00:23:30,374
When can you begin?

232
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:31,957
I'm not quite sure...

233
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:33,457
This afternoon?

234
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:36,332
Perhaps.
It would only be the afternoon.

235
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,457
I must leave at five.
I really must.

236
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:44,707
Two to five. That's fine.
But you must be punctual.

237
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:47,957
I promise you
you'll be free at five.

238
00:23:49,875 --> 00:23:51,540
Goodbye. Excuse me.

239
00:23:51,708 --> 00:23:54,290
See you at two, then.

240
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:14,957
Anything wrong?

241
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:19,249
I was just out shopping
and I wanted to see you.

242
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:21,415
But you don't like hospitals.

243
00:24:21,583 --> 00:24:23,207
No, I don't.

244
00:24:23,375 --> 00:24:26,415
I don't want to be alone.
I'll take you to lunch.

245
00:24:26,583 --> 00:24:29,999
I told you. I'm lunching
with the head surgeon.

246
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:32,124
- I know but...
- I'm sorry.

247
00:24:33,166 --> 00:24:36,165
Don't forget our dinner
with the Fevrets this evening.

248
00:24:37,416 --> 00:24:39,832
- Sorry to bother you.
- Bother me?

249
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,207
See you tonight. I'll be home
as soon as possible.

250
00:25:33,583 --> 00:25:35,499
I had given you up.

251
00:25:35,666 --> 00:25:38,415
You went off in such a hurry.

252
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:41,499
I thought I had frightened you.
Come in.

253
00:25:45,708 --> 00:25:47,665
Put your things in here.

254
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,832
You'll see the others in a moment.

255
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,457
Mathilde and Charlotte.

256
00:25:55,625 --> 00:25:57,540
Both charming.

257
00:25:58,291 --> 00:26:01,207
I'll only have
well brought up girls.

258
00:26:01,375 --> 00:26:03,332
And above all, cheerful.

259
00:26:04,291 --> 00:26:06,832
I like them to enjoy their work.

260
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:11,707
Last week, I had to let
a beautiful girl go.

261
00:26:11,875 --> 00:26:15,082
Much too vulgar... Pity.

262
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,957
What's your name?

263
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:24,582
I don't want...

264
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,249
I'm not asking for your real name.

265
00:26:27,666 --> 00:26:30,540
You don't imagine my name is Anaïs!

266
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:34,165
We'll have a drink to celebrate.

267
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,624
Just a tiny one.
Cherries in brandy.

268
00:26:39,416 --> 00:26:43,249
We must find you a name.
Something simple and pretty.

269
00:26:43,833 --> 00:26:45,415
Easy to remember.

270
00:26:46,208 --> 00:26:48,040
Let's think of one.

271
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:56,332
That's Monsieur Adolphe.
One of our best clients.

272
00:26:57,166 --> 00:26:59,374
You'll see, very amusing.

273
00:27:00,708 --> 00:27:04,332
I've an idea.
What if we call you "Belle de Jour"?

274
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:07,082
Since you only come
in the afternoon.

275
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,040
All right.

276
00:27:11,916 --> 00:27:13,790
Don't be so nervous.

277
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:16,374
Relax.

278
00:27:16,541 --> 00:27:19,290
You'll leave at five,
don't worry.

279
00:27:20,666 --> 00:27:22,665
Will somebody be waiting?

280
00:27:23,583 --> 00:27:25,457
A boyfriend?

281
00:27:26,041 --> 00:27:27,415
A husband?

282
00:27:28,125 --> 00:27:30,540
Don't worry.
I'm not inquisitive.

283
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,540
Give me a kiss.

284
00:27:36,458 --> 00:27:38,665
The ladies are thirsty.

285
00:27:39,125 --> 00:27:40,790
Wait for me here.

286
00:27:52,375 --> 00:27:55,082
A new one!
And you're hiding her!

287
00:27:55,708 --> 00:27:59,165
Bring her quick.
Or I'll get her myself.

288
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:14,957
He's very funny.

289
00:28:15,125 --> 00:28:18,249
A candy manufacturer
from Bordeaux.

290
00:28:18,833 --> 00:28:21,165
He makes millions. Come on.

291
00:28:23,416 --> 00:28:27,290
If I don't get it every day,
I can't sleep.

292
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:29,457
The other day,

293
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:33,540
I had a coloured girl.
What a party!

294
00:28:37,541 --> 00:28:39,499
This is Belle de Jour.

295
00:28:42,166 --> 00:28:43,707
I told you about the curtains.

296
00:28:43,875 --> 00:28:48,374
My respects of a quarter to three.
Have a glass of champagne.

297
00:28:48,541 --> 00:28:51,082
Anaïs, a bottle,
and make it snappy!

298
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:54,999
You're lucky.
When you're new, they open a bottle.

299
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:57,165
You must have smelt the champagne!

300
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,499
Get acquainted.
I'll be right back.

301
00:29:06,458 --> 00:29:09,707
What a woman!
Every bit of her's good!

302
00:29:09,875 --> 00:29:11,790
Forget it.
She's too respectable.

303
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:13,749
That's just it.

304
00:29:13,916 --> 00:29:16,499
This man. Can't stop him!

305
00:29:16,666 --> 00:29:18,374
What a character!

306
00:29:18,958 --> 00:29:20,665
Pretty dress!

307
00:29:20,833 --> 00:29:24,332
But not convenient for a quick strip.
Right, Monsieur Adolphe?

308
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,665
Oh, no, she's great in that dress.

309
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:30,665
Very refined. I like that.

310
00:29:30,833 --> 00:29:34,082
You might give me one like that.

311
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:36,582
My name's not Rothschild, honey.

312
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,124
Shame!

313
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,290
What a cut.

314
00:29:42,291 --> 00:29:44,124
Look at the detail.

315
00:29:44,291 --> 00:29:46,540
It's all a matter of money.

316
00:29:46,708 --> 00:29:48,874
You can't buy class.

317
00:29:49,041 --> 00:29:50,457
Here's the champagne.

318
00:29:51,916 --> 00:29:53,749
About time!
I was running dry!

319
00:29:58,375 --> 00:30:00,874
Leave it! That's a man's job.

320
00:30:01,041 --> 00:30:04,165
I'm the world's champion
cork-popper.

321
00:30:04,583 --> 00:30:06,207
What wrist action!

322
00:30:06,375 --> 00:30:09,624
<i>I like ham and eggs.</i>

323
00:30:09,791 --> 00:30:12,790
<i>But I love best...</i>

324
00:30:12,958 --> 00:30:16,749
<i>a pair of legs.</i>

325
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,374
Of course, it's too warm.

326
00:30:21,541 --> 00:30:24,124
Warm champagne is like tea.

327
00:30:24,291 --> 00:30:27,665
Had I known
I'd have put it in the freezer.

328
00:30:27,833 --> 00:30:29,832
But you knew I was coming.

329
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,790
I didn't know Belle de Jour was.

330
00:30:31,958 --> 00:30:35,290
To the most precious
health of all...

331
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:37,999
- Mine!
- And to Belle de Jour!

332
00:30:40,958 --> 00:30:42,540
Okay, but a little warm.

333
00:30:43,583 --> 00:30:47,165
Mathilde, I've a present for you.

334
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,957
- What is it?
- Have a look.

335
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:11,957
He always comes up
with something new.

336
00:31:12,625 --> 00:31:13,999
Here's to fun!

337
00:31:14,166 --> 00:31:16,874
That's how I am. I like fun.

338
00:31:23,541 --> 00:31:25,582
Well, Belle de Jour...

339
00:31:26,166 --> 00:31:27,749
You're mad at us?

340
00:31:29,791 --> 00:31:31,457
What's the matter?

341
00:31:38,291 --> 00:31:39,499
You'll see...

342
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:43,290
We'll have a good time together.

343
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:50,957
What's eating her?

344
00:31:51,125 --> 00:31:52,832
I'll talk to her.

345
00:31:53,375 --> 00:31:55,374
Don't rush her.
It's the first time.

346
00:31:55,541 --> 00:31:58,582
- That's what you think.
- But it is.

347
00:32:04,041 --> 00:32:07,124
- Who does she think she is?
- She's new.

348
00:32:07,708 --> 00:32:10,582
You've made a hit already.

349
00:32:11,041 --> 00:32:13,999
Don't worry.
He's very easy-going.

350
00:32:14,875 --> 00:32:17,082
Do what he wants, that's all.

351
00:32:17,666 --> 00:32:19,374
- I want to go.
- What?

352
00:32:20,375 --> 00:32:22,790
How much longer are you going
to play this game?

353
00:32:22,958 --> 00:32:24,915
Who do you think you are?

354
00:32:26,791 --> 00:32:28,374
Very well, I'm going...

355
00:32:30,083 --> 00:32:31,665
Leave me alone with her.

356
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:35,165
What you need is a firm hand.

357
00:32:47,875 --> 00:32:49,082
Hi!

358
00:32:50,041 --> 00:32:51,540
Close the door.

359
00:32:55,875 --> 00:32:57,749
I've sent the others away.

360
00:32:57,916 --> 00:32:59,957
It's more intimate.

361
00:33:00,708 --> 00:33:01,999
So...

362
00:33:02,708 --> 00:33:05,457
They say it's your first time.

363
00:33:07,583 --> 00:33:12,040
Careful now. Don't tell me any lies.
I can tell.

364
00:33:13,541 --> 00:33:14,832
But...

365
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,540
if it's true...

366
00:33:16,708 --> 00:33:18,832
No need to be ashamed.

367
00:33:19,375 --> 00:33:23,124
Don't tell me
you're a virgin at your age...

368
00:33:25,166 --> 00:33:26,915
We'll soon find out.

369
00:33:27,708 --> 00:33:29,040
Well now...

370
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:31,415
Do I frighten you?

371
00:33:31,833 --> 00:33:33,999
Is it my face you don't like?

372
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,374
You'll have to get used to it.

373
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:44,790
You won't get out of it like that.

374
00:33:44,958 --> 00:33:48,249
Who do you think you are,
little bitch!

375
00:33:48,416 --> 00:33:50,874
Leading me on,
and then stopping me.

376
00:33:51,458 --> 00:33:54,874
I've had enough of your playacting.

377
00:34:01,625 --> 00:34:03,332
That's better.

378
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:09,749
So... it's rough stuff you need,
is it?

379
00:34:16,125 --> 00:34:19,040
Jack of Clubs is my gin card.

380
00:34:23,541 --> 00:34:25,665
Adolphe is taking his time.

381
00:34:25,833 --> 00:34:27,415
So he should!

382
00:36:05,625 --> 00:36:08,707
Where are you, Severine?
Are you ready?

383
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:12,749
Oh, you're here.

384
00:36:12,916 --> 00:36:15,707
What's wrong?
Is something the matter?

385
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:17,999
Are you ill?

386
00:36:23,625 --> 00:36:25,874
You don't have a temperature.

387
00:36:26,333 --> 00:36:30,540
- Should I send for someone?
- It's nothing. I was asleep.

388
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:33,457
I had a headache.

389
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:36,665
I took an aspirin and a bath.
I'll be all right.

390
00:36:36,833 --> 00:36:38,415
What time is it?

391
00:36:38,583 --> 00:36:42,415
Late. I'll phone
and tell the Fevrets not to wait.

392
00:36:42,583 --> 00:36:44,957
- Go without me.
- Certainly not.

393
00:36:45,125 --> 00:36:48,415
It's better if I stay
and I've some work to finish.

394
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:52,415
Sleep well.

395
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,665
How's the soup?

396
00:37:25,833 --> 00:37:28,624
It's cold and I can't warm it.

397
00:37:33,166 --> 00:37:35,249
Are bulls given names like cats?

398
00:37:35,416 --> 00:37:38,499
Yes. Most of them
are called Remorse

399
00:37:39,041 --> 00:37:42,040
except the last one.
He's called Expiation.

400
00:37:53,333 --> 00:37:54,540
What time is it?

401
00:37:54,708 --> 00:37:57,832
Between two and five.
But no later than five.

402
00:37:58,791 --> 00:38:01,290
- How's your wife?
- Very well, thank you.

403
00:38:01,458 --> 00:38:03,499
- Where is she?
- Just there.

404
00:38:03,666 --> 00:38:05,999
- Want to say hello?
- With pleasure.

405
00:38:06,166 --> 00:38:07,749
How are you, piece of trash?

406
00:38:07,916 --> 00:38:10,415
Feeling all right, slut?

407
00:38:10,958 --> 00:38:12,249
Scum!

408
00:38:12,416 --> 00:38:13,582
Swill!

409
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:15,082
Rubbish!

410
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:17,832
- Dung devourer!
- Sodomite!

411
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,290
- Spermentress!
- Bitch!

412
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,124
Pierre, stop! I love you.

413
00:38:28,166 --> 00:38:29,957
What do you want?

414
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:32,290
I... I wanted...

415
00:38:32,458 --> 00:38:34,040
To come back?

416
00:38:34,583 --> 00:38:38,124
And then disappear again for a week
without a word...

417
00:38:38,291 --> 00:38:42,499
- Forgive me.
- There's the street for amateurs.

418
00:38:42,666 --> 00:38:44,332
Please...

419
00:38:46,125 --> 00:38:48,332
You're lucky to be dealing with me.

420
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:51,582
Others would have
slammed the door on you.

421
00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:56,707
I'm too kind-hearted.

422
00:38:57,833 --> 00:39:01,040
If you come back, you must behave.

423
00:39:02,458 --> 00:39:04,457
Can I count on you every day?

424
00:39:04,625 --> 00:39:06,915
But only till five.

425
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:14,124
I'm glad to see you back.

426
00:39:14,958 --> 00:39:17,790
- Belle de Jour, how are you?
- Fine, thank you.

427
00:39:17,958 --> 00:39:20,790
- You ran out on us.
- Why didn't you come sooner?

428
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:23,457
- I couldn't.
- Give me your coat.

429
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:26,082
A cute coat!

430
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:28,332
I've a favor to ask of you.

431
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:32,082
Could you lend it to me for Sunday?
I'll give it back on Monday.

432
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:36,915
Well... I'm sorry,
but Sunday is a little difficult.

433
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:40,290
- Couldn't you...?
- It's OK. I saw it in ready-made.

434
00:39:40,458 --> 00:39:43,540
Carducci!
Some people do themselves proud!

435
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,999
Who are you?

436
00:39:48,125 --> 00:39:50,082
Are you sad to be back?

437
00:39:50,708 --> 00:39:55,207
I come here because my fiancé
had an accident and can't work.

438
00:39:55,666 --> 00:39:58,624
He knows I come here.
But I love him.

439
00:39:59,333 --> 00:40:01,707
Of course I could get a job.

440
00:40:01,875 --> 00:40:04,124
- What would you earn?
- True.

441
00:40:05,291 --> 00:40:07,749
The professor will be here
any minute.

442
00:40:08,083 --> 00:40:10,165
You must meet him.

443
00:40:10,333 --> 00:40:13,207
- You're his type.
- Who is he?

444
00:40:13,625 --> 00:40:16,374
A famous gynaecologist.

445
00:40:16,541 --> 00:40:18,207
He has an international reputation.

446
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:20,582
He's even operated in Copenhagen.

447
00:40:21,916 --> 00:40:24,874
There he is.
Explain things to her.

448
00:40:26,916 --> 00:40:28,707
It's dark already.

449
00:40:31,541 --> 00:40:35,207
You'll see, it's not difficult.
If only they were all like him!

450
00:40:36,916 --> 00:40:38,707
I have a new one.

451
00:40:38,875 --> 00:40:42,249
I think you'll like her.
A bit shy but...

452
00:40:42,416 --> 00:40:44,374
a real aristocrat.

453
00:40:45,625 --> 00:40:48,749
So much the better.
Send her to me.

454
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,415
What are you doing?

455
00:42:13,708 --> 00:42:16,040
Didn't they tell you?
Get dressed.

456
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,665
Her Ladyship sent for me?

457
00:42:40,666 --> 00:42:43,374
Is Her Ladyship
not satisfied with me?

458
00:42:43,541 --> 00:42:44,832
Well...

459
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:46,624
no...

460
00:42:55,833 --> 00:42:57,874
You belong in the kitchen...

461
00:42:59,041 --> 00:43:01,290
She's useless. Send me Charlotte.

462
00:43:01,458 --> 00:43:02,749
Right away.

463
00:43:03,625 --> 00:43:05,040
You come with me.

464
00:43:12,666 --> 00:43:14,540
Charlotte, go to the professor.

465
00:43:14,708 --> 00:43:16,665
Just a sec.
I'll finish undressing.

466
00:43:16,833 --> 00:43:19,415
Get in! It's not that difficult!

467
00:43:31,291 --> 00:43:32,665
Stand here!

468
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,207
Watch how Charlotte does it.

469
00:43:38,375 --> 00:43:40,124
And be very quiet.

470
00:44:01,916 --> 00:44:03,582
Her Ladyship sent for me?

471
00:44:04,625 --> 00:44:06,874
Is Her Ladyship
not satisfied with me?

472
00:44:07,041 --> 00:44:09,207
You make a mess of everything.

473
00:44:10,333 --> 00:44:13,040
It's true. I do.

474
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,457
But Her Ladyship is so kind
and so forgiving.

475
00:44:17,625 --> 00:44:19,832
- And so beautiful.
- Impudent!

476
00:44:23,041 --> 00:44:24,374
Look!

477
00:44:24,916 --> 00:44:27,374
You must be blind.
Can't you see?

478
00:44:27,541 --> 00:44:31,790
There's dust everywhere...
There! And there!

479
00:44:35,291 --> 00:44:37,082
I broke a vase...

480
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:39,124
A vase! That's it!

481
00:44:39,291 --> 00:44:40,665
This time you're fired.

482
00:44:40,833 --> 00:44:44,540
No! I implore Her Ladyship
to keep me.

483
00:44:44,958 --> 00:44:49,207
Keep me near her. I'll make up for it.
I'll be very careful, I swear.

484
00:44:49,958 --> 00:44:52,832
- Not yet, Charlotte. Give it here!
- Oh, sorry.

485
00:44:53,541 --> 00:44:55,749
I implore Her Ladyship
to punish me...

486
00:44:56,125 --> 00:44:57,749
To beat me.

487
00:44:57,916 --> 00:44:59,624
But not to send me away.

488
00:44:59,791 --> 00:45:01,332
What are you doing?
You're disgusting.

489
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,665
I'm not doing anything.

490
00:45:03,833 --> 00:45:05,999
I don't dare... alas!

491
00:45:06,166 --> 00:45:07,749
I ought not to say it...

492
00:45:07,916 --> 00:45:09,790
It's a secret...

493
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:12,207
- I love you...
- What?

494
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,332
I love you.

495
00:45:17,875 --> 00:45:19,749
And now that I have told you...

496
00:45:20,333 --> 00:45:22,540
of my great love...

497
00:45:23,916 --> 00:45:25,707
Kick me

498
00:45:25,875 --> 00:45:27,582
and spit on me.
Walk over my face.

499
00:45:29,708 --> 00:45:33,124
You dirty old man.
You swine. I'll teach you...

500
00:45:43,708 --> 00:45:46,124
Come on. Somebody's waiting.

501
00:45:48,416 --> 00:45:50,124
Well, did you see?

502
00:45:50,291 --> 00:45:51,832
What do you think?

503
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,582
How can anyone sink so low?

504
00:45:55,208 --> 00:45:57,832
I suppose you're used to it.
But I'm not.

505
00:46:05,333 --> 00:46:07,915
Not me, thank you.

506
00:46:12,416 --> 00:46:15,165
How about this one?

507
00:46:23,666 --> 00:46:25,082
What's this?

508
00:46:28,041 --> 00:46:31,457
That's no good here. Cash!

509
00:46:40,708 --> 00:46:42,249
Very good. Off you go.

510
00:47:30,833 --> 00:47:32,582
Don't be afraid.

511
00:48:13,666 --> 00:48:15,207
- Did you work hard?
- Yes, mom.

512
00:48:15,375 --> 00:48:16,832
Have you been good?

513
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,124
Say good afternoon to auntie.
Show her your grades.

514
00:48:21,666 --> 00:48:23,165
Hello, Cathy.

515
00:48:25,041 --> 00:48:26,832
Show me your report card.

516
00:48:29,458 --> 00:48:31,040
Don't you say hello to me?

517
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:32,915
Hello, Miss Mathilde.

518
00:48:34,583 --> 00:48:38,124
I'll take you to the fair on Sunday.
Would you like that?

519
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,957
7 in history, 9 in recital.
Very good.

520
00:48:48,458 --> 00:48:50,749
The professor wants an inkpot.

521
00:48:51,541 --> 00:48:53,832
- What's going on?
- He wants an inkpot.

522
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,915
An inkpot? I haven't got one.

523
00:49:22,333 --> 00:49:24,832
Go upstairs and do your homework.

524
00:49:53,666 --> 00:49:56,124
That man would frighten me too.

525
00:49:57,083 --> 00:49:59,749
It must be painful sometimes...

526
00:50:01,666 --> 00:50:03,832
How would you know, Pallas?

527
00:50:50,333 --> 00:50:51,874
May I, Miss?

528
00:50:52,041 --> 00:50:53,499
Of course you may.

529
00:50:56,916 --> 00:50:58,374
Miss or Missus?

530
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:01,332
Fine.

531
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:04,165
What is your name?

532
00:51:04,333 --> 00:51:05,999
Belle de Jour.

533
00:51:06,166 --> 00:51:07,749
Charming!

534
00:51:07,916 --> 00:51:11,249
I had a cat
called Beauty of Twilight.

535
00:51:13,208 --> 00:51:15,124
You come here often?

536
00:51:15,791 --> 00:51:17,665
Every day in my thoughts.

537
00:51:20,291 --> 00:51:22,415
A pleasant morning, isn't it?

538
00:51:22,583 --> 00:51:24,290
Yes, it is.

539
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:27,874
I much enjoy the autumn sun.

540
00:51:28,333 --> 00:51:30,374
The black sun.

541
00:51:33,083 --> 00:51:35,415
You are very elegant.

542
00:51:37,291 --> 00:51:39,124
Do you like money?

543
00:51:40,458 --> 00:51:41,624
Yes.

544
00:51:42,041 --> 00:51:44,749
I'll give you a lot
if you come home with me.

545
00:51:44,916 --> 00:51:45,749
With you?

546
00:51:45,916 --> 00:51:49,374
Have no fear.
It's a sort of ceremony.

547
00:51:50,041 --> 00:51:53,499
A very moving religious ceremony
that means a lot to me.

548
00:51:53,833 --> 00:51:56,374
I am a man of another age...

549
00:51:56,541 --> 00:51:59,249
an age when there was
a feeling for death.

550
00:52:00,208 --> 00:52:03,874
You would make me very happy
if you'd come.

551
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:06,915
You're just the girl
I'm looking for.

552
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:09,915
I live an hour away from Paris.

553
00:52:10,666 --> 00:52:12,290
Here's my card.

554
00:52:13,208 --> 00:52:15,124
I will meet you at the station.

555
00:52:54,083 --> 00:52:56,624
Kindly put this on.

556
00:52:56,791 --> 00:52:58,499
What's it all about?

557
00:52:59,458 --> 00:53:02,165
Don't be alarmed.

558
00:53:02,958 --> 00:53:06,499
Those who preceded you
would like to come back.

559
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,707
But the Duke is very strict
on this matter.

560
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:16,999
Please walk this way.

561
00:53:21,958 --> 00:53:23,165
Through here.

562
00:53:37,916 --> 00:53:39,040
This way.

563
00:54:05,875 --> 00:54:08,165
I brought you lilies...

564
00:54:08,875 --> 00:54:10,582
that you loved so much.

565
00:54:11,583 --> 00:54:13,207
How beautiful you are!

566
00:54:14,416 --> 00:54:16,499
Your skin is whiter...

567
00:54:18,166 --> 00:54:20,624
and your hair softer.

568
00:54:33,166 --> 00:54:35,165
My beloved daughter.

569
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,124
Your face is cold.

570
00:54:44,791 --> 00:54:47,832
Do you remember...
we used to play here together?

571
00:54:48,458 --> 00:54:50,915
How we laughed and sang!

572
00:54:53,083 --> 00:54:55,874
Now you just lie there

573
00:54:56,458 --> 00:54:58,124
and say nothing.

574
00:54:59,958 --> 00:55:02,124
I hope you have forgiven me.

575
00:55:02,625 --> 00:55:05,082
It's not my fault.
I loved you so much.

576
00:55:06,166 --> 00:55:08,957
Your Lordship,
shall I let the cats in?

577
00:55:09,125 --> 00:55:10,832
Go to hell with your cats!

578
00:55:15,958 --> 00:55:17,707
We are quite alone.

579
00:55:19,416 --> 00:55:21,290
The doors are all closed.

580
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,540
Now...

581
00:55:30,375 --> 00:55:32,749
your eyes will never open again.

582
00:55:33,791 --> 00:55:35,832
Your limbs are stiff.

583
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:39,832
Worms are eating your heart.

584
00:55:41,958 --> 00:55:45,415
And this sickly odor
of dead flowers.

585
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:23,999
Still here?
What are you waiting for?

586
00:56:24,166 --> 00:56:25,957
But it's raining and...

587
00:56:26,333 --> 00:56:27,999
So what?

588
00:56:29,416 --> 00:56:31,582
Get the hell out of here!

589
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:33,207
Go on, out!

590
00:56:57,416 --> 00:56:58,957
Are you almost finished?

591
00:56:59,125 --> 00:57:00,374
Coming.

592
00:57:13,708 --> 00:57:15,582
Shall I stay with you?

593
00:57:27,958 --> 00:57:30,290
I only wish you'd stay more often...

594
00:57:30,458 --> 00:57:32,124
of your own free will.

595
00:57:32,291 --> 00:57:34,957
I will, Pierre. Give me time.

596
00:57:35,125 --> 00:57:38,582
I always feel I'm imposing on you.

597
00:57:39,083 --> 00:57:40,832
Don't believe that.

598
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,415
More and more
I want to be alone with you.

599
00:57:44,083 --> 00:57:46,040
You don't frighten me now.

600
00:57:46,208 --> 00:57:50,665
I feel that I understand you better,
that I'm getting closer to you.

601
00:57:51,833 --> 00:57:54,124
Every day I love you more.

602
00:58:06,916 --> 00:58:08,415
Is Madame at home?

603
00:58:09,625 --> 00:58:11,832
- Whom shall I say?
- Monsieur Husson.

604
00:58:15,541 --> 00:58:17,790
Monsieur Husson to see you,
Madame.

605
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:20,290
Tell him I'm not at home.

606
00:58:28,541 --> 00:58:30,624
Good afternoon, Miss. Thank you.

607
00:58:44,083 --> 00:58:46,249
How seductive you are!

608
00:58:47,291 --> 00:58:49,540
I feel like writing a letter.

609
00:58:49,708 --> 00:58:51,415
I'd be delighted.

610
00:58:51,583 --> 00:58:53,290
But would you accept?

611
00:58:54,458 --> 00:58:55,999
There are too many people here.

612
00:58:56,166 --> 00:58:57,749
All the better!

613
00:58:57,916 --> 00:59:00,249
I must give you a receipt.

614
00:59:00,416 --> 00:59:01,915
I'm relying on it.

615
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:06,790
With that?

616
00:59:14,833 --> 00:59:16,415
What are they doing?

617
00:59:17,666 --> 00:59:20,957
Nothing. Just fooling around.
Have a look.

618
00:59:21,125 --> 00:59:22,832
No. You tell me.

619
00:59:24,166 --> 00:59:26,457
- He's taking an envelope.
- And?

620
00:59:27,666 --> 00:59:29,915
No... it's a packet of lily seeds.

621
00:59:32,208 --> 00:59:34,082
Oh yes, I see.

622
01:00:27,625 --> 01:00:29,790
- What floor?
- Fourth.

623
01:00:35,458 --> 01:00:37,040
What are you doing?

624
01:00:38,041 --> 01:00:39,999
Help!

625
01:00:43,666 --> 01:00:45,915
Don't do anything stupid.
You're crazy.

626
01:00:46,791 --> 01:00:48,374
Hurry up! Quickly!

627
01:01:39,958 --> 01:01:42,790
Well, Hippolyte!
How about that?

628
01:01:42,958 --> 01:01:45,540
Hello, Anaïs.
Can we come in?

629
01:01:46,333 --> 01:01:47,874
Of course.

630
01:01:54,208 --> 01:01:55,415
Through there.

631
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:07,874
- It's Hippolyte.
- From Murcia?

632
01:02:08,291 --> 01:02:10,457
I'd hoped we were rid of him.

633
01:02:10,833 --> 01:02:12,707
I don't know the other one.

634
01:02:13,125 --> 01:02:14,332
Who is Hippolyte?

635
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:17,415
Who knows? A strange kind of guy.

636
01:02:18,083 --> 01:02:20,124
He spends money like water.

637
01:02:20,291 --> 01:02:22,707
But when he's broke,
he gets it free.

638
01:02:23,625 --> 01:02:26,040
Come along, girls.
All three of you.

639
01:02:34,958 --> 01:02:36,790
How's the little one?

640
01:02:37,583 --> 01:02:39,415
Is she ready to be kissed?

641
01:02:39,583 --> 01:02:42,374
I don't know, Sir.
She has to finish school.

642
01:02:42,541 --> 01:02:44,082
Great!

643
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:51,332
You won't complain.

644
01:02:55,416 --> 01:02:56,874
What does that mean?

645
01:02:58,166 --> 01:02:59,582
How are you?

646
01:02:59,750 --> 01:03:02,040
- Okay, and you?
- We keep going.

647
01:03:02,666 --> 01:03:05,165
We haven't seen you for months.

648
01:03:05,333 --> 01:03:07,415
- We missed you a lot.
- Really?

649
01:03:07,583 --> 01:03:10,040
- Where were you?
- On a trip.

650
01:03:10,541 --> 01:03:11,999
New York.

651
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,165
Put three bottles on ice.
Good ones.

652
01:03:18,541 --> 01:03:20,124
The best.

653
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:29,207
What you miss most abroad

654
01:03:29,375 --> 01:03:31,082
is champagne.

655
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:38,582
I've brought someone with me.
He's a buddy.

656
01:03:38,916 --> 01:03:41,374
Treat him... good.

657
01:03:41,791 --> 01:03:43,665
Of course we will.

658
01:03:46,125 --> 01:03:49,457
When we're alone, I'll tell you
a new story. You'll like it.

659
01:03:49,625 --> 01:03:51,457
You can keep it.

660
01:03:51,625 --> 01:03:52,999
Too bad for you.

661
01:03:55,041 --> 01:03:56,790
Get off. You're too heavy.

662
01:03:56,958 --> 01:03:58,457
Well I never...

663
01:03:58,625 --> 01:04:00,957
You scram too. You're tickling.

664
01:04:02,708 --> 01:04:05,040
Come here, you.
The new girl.

665
01:04:11,708 --> 01:04:13,290
Leave her to me.

666
01:04:19,291 --> 01:04:23,124
Take her, kid, if you want her.
Have fun. She's your age.

667
01:04:32,666 --> 01:04:35,082
I'd have slit my father's throat
for less.

668
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:39,707
But friendship comes first.
We mustn't fight over una zorra.

669
01:04:44,416 --> 01:04:45,915
Say...

670
01:04:46,083 --> 01:04:47,457
Your friend seems timid.

671
01:04:47,625 --> 01:04:48,790
Timid isn't the word.

672
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:52,415
The champagne's served.
Aren't you thirsty?

673
01:04:57,166 --> 01:04:59,832
- What's your name?
- Belle de Jour.

674
01:05:00,541 --> 01:05:01,915
What else?

675
01:05:02,291 --> 01:05:03,332
Nothing.

676
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:04,790
Don't you trust me?

677
01:05:05,625 --> 01:05:07,415
I want to know your name.

678
01:05:09,083 --> 01:05:12,540
Aren't you here at night?
What do you do then?

679
01:05:14,291 --> 01:05:15,874
Nice boots!

680
01:05:21,875 --> 01:05:23,499
Your teeth...

681
01:05:23,666 --> 01:05:24,999
What happened?

682
01:05:25,625 --> 01:05:27,540
Knocked out in one blow.

683
01:05:29,916 --> 01:05:31,665
Does it bother you?

684
01:05:32,166 --> 01:05:33,874
Then make it fast.

685
01:05:39,166 --> 01:05:41,374
- How old are you?
- 23.

686
01:05:42,416 --> 01:05:44,207
Who protects you?

687
01:05:44,375 --> 01:05:45,707
What do you mean?

688
01:05:45,875 --> 01:05:47,332
Are you free or not?

689
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:51,124
Make plenty of money?

690
01:05:52,125 --> 01:05:53,707
Yes, but...

691
01:05:53,875 --> 01:05:55,624
Don't tell me any lies.

692
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,749
Keep your stockings on.

693
01:05:58,708 --> 01:06:00,915
A girl once tried to strangle me.

694
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:03,249
Poor thing...

695
01:06:03,416 --> 01:06:04,957
With you, it's free.

696
01:06:06,666 --> 01:06:08,332
Naturally!

697
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:11,124
Many would like to be in your place.

698
01:06:12,375 --> 01:06:14,165
Still won't tell me your name?

699
01:06:15,416 --> 01:06:17,040
You don't talk much.

700
01:06:17,458 --> 01:06:20,582
Good. Can't stand girls
who chatter.

701
01:06:22,125 --> 01:06:23,874
Not bad.

702
01:06:25,916 --> 01:06:27,790
Shame you only have two of them.

703
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:29,707
Let's see.

704
01:06:30,041 --> 01:06:31,457
Turn around.

705
01:06:34,208 --> 01:06:36,165
What's that brown spot?

706
01:06:36,333 --> 01:06:37,707
A birthmark.

707
01:06:37,875 --> 01:06:40,082
Oh hell! I don't like that!

708
01:06:40,666 --> 01:06:42,207
Get dressed.

709
01:06:46,291 --> 01:06:48,707
Not cold enough, as usual.

710
01:06:48,875 --> 01:06:50,165
You read English?

711
01:06:50,333 --> 01:06:52,665
- Me? No.
- So why the paper?

712
01:06:53,041 --> 01:06:54,499
What's it to do with you?

713
01:06:58,458 --> 01:06:59,707
Enough!

714
01:07:00,541 --> 01:07:03,207
Take that one to the room.
I'll join you.

715
01:07:03,541 --> 01:07:05,290
The other's for Marcel.

716
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:09,165
Who is your friend?

717
01:07:09,625 --> 01:07:13,040
He saved my life last year.
I love him like a son.

718
01:07:13,208 --> 01:07:15,915
That's why I let him
have the blonde.

719
01:07:16,083 --> 01:07:17,624
Where does she come from?

720
01:07:17,791 --> 01:07:19,499
- Belle de Jour?
- Yes.

721
01:07:19,666 --> 01:07:21,540
Is she much in demand?

722
01:07:21,708 --> 01:07:22,957
All the time.

723
01:07:23,458 --> 01:07:25,790
She not only has class but...

724
01:07:25,958 --> 01:07:27,249
What?

725
01:07:27,416 --> 01:07:29,124
She's a pearl.

726
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,749
I thought you wanted to go.

727
01:07:39,416 --> 01:07:41,249
I'm glad I stayed.

728
01:07:41,416 --> 01:07:44,499
I'll tell you. You're my type.

729
01:07:46,708 --> 01:07:49,874
Look at my hand.
It's still trembling.

730
01:07:54,083 --> 01:07:55,540
What's that?

731
01:07:56,458 --> 01:07:57,874
A buttonhole.

732
01:07:58,041 --> 01:08:00,290
- A knife wound?
- Possibly.

733
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:02,874
Why do you come here?

734
01:08:03,041 --> 01:08:04,749
Don't ask me anything.

735
01:08:05,583 --> 01:08:08,207
I'd like to keep you till tonight
but I can't.

736
01:08:08,791 --> 01:08:10,832
I like you too, Marcel.

737
01:08:11,208 --> 01:08:12,624
You'll come back?

738
01:08:12,791 --> 01:08:14,165
It's possible.

739
01:08:14,583 --> 01:08:17,290
- If you've no money, I can...
- Money!

740
01:08:18,125 --> 01:08:19,874
It's not money I need.

741
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:21,957
You frighten me.

742
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,332
- I can see you're bored.
- No.

743
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:55,582
I just want to go back to Paris.

744
01:08:56,625 --> 01:08:58,790
You know you can tell me
everything,

745
01:08:58,958 --> 01:09:00,749
but you're hiding something.

746
01:09:02,375 --> 01:09:05,582
If only you'd confide in me,
perhaps I could help you.

747
01:09:05,750 --> 01:09:07,165
Confide what?

748
01:09:08,083 --> 01:09:09,832
That you love someone.

749
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,707
Someone else?

750
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:14,374
You know I couldn't.

751
01:09:15,458 --> 01:09:17,290
I suggested this holiday

752
01:09:17,458 --> 01:09:19,957
to find out if something
was keeping you in Paris.

753
01:09:20,125 --> 01:09:22,374
I was right.
You want to go back.

754
01:09:23,125 --> 01:09:25,207
Above all I feel...

755
01:09:25,583 --> 01:09:27,499
your aloofness.

756
01:09:27,666 --> 01:09:30,165
You're never really...
with me.

757
01:09:30,333 --> 01:09:31,665
Forgive me.

758
01:09:33,083 --> 01:09:34,749
It's probably my fault.

759
01:09:35,083 --> 01:09:37,332
You believe I don't love you?

760
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:38,999
Yes, I think so.

761
01:09:44,666 --> 01:09:46,749
<i>I don't know how to explain.</i>

762
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:50,749
<i>There are many things</i>
<i>I don't understand myself.</i>

763
01:09:50,916 --> 01:09:52,707
<i>Things about myself.</i>

764
01:09:53,250 --> 01:09:55,832
<i>My feelings for you</i>
<i>have nothing to do with pleasure.</i>

765
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,665
<i>It's much more than that.</i>

766
01:09:57,833 --> 01:10:01,874
<i>You may not believe this,</i>
<i>but I've never felt so close to you.</i>

767
01:10:02,833 --> 01:10:04,374
You want to go back to Paris?

768
01:10:04,708 --> 01:10:06,707
But I'm not bored with you.

769
01:10:06,875 --> 01:10:08,707
Let's stay another week.

770
01:10:08,875 --> 01:10:12,040
No, we'll leave tomorrow.
I must go back anyway.

771
01:10:28,875 --> 01:10:30,207
See you soon.

772
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:32,874
Troubles, Mr Marcel?

773
01:10:33,041 --> 01:10:36,124
Never seen anyone
hooked like you are.

774
01:10:36,291 --> 01:10:37,415
Stop it, will you!

775
01:10:37,583 --> 01:10:40,957
Behaving like an imbecile,
not like a man.

776
01:10:49,750 --> 01:10:51,874
We waited for you Thursday.

777
01:10:52,666 --> 01:10:55,749
- So what?
- Next time, we won't wait. Get me?

778
01:10:56,166 --> 01:10:57,749
We nearly didn't come today either.

779
01:10:57,916 --> 01:10:58,999
Really?

780
01:10:59,666 --> 01:11:03,915
The inflation's lasted long enough.
We're sick of you and your goon.

781
01:11:04,583 --> 01:11:07,082
Not with that yellow rat.

782
01:11:08,041 --> 01:11:11,707
Please, gentlemen, go outside.

783
01:11:12,125 --> 01:11:14,040
Shut your trap!

784
01:11:15,416 --> 01:11:18,332
The snow.
We know you've got it.

785
01:11:24,750 --> 01:11:26,665
We're not keeping you.

786
01:11:29,333 --> 01:11:30,790
I'll settle with you
about the goon.

787
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:34,040
As you like.

788
01:12:03,875 --> 01:12:06,665
Pierrot, an anisette.

789
01:12:16,166 --> 01:12:17,457
Where are you going?

790
01:12:17,625 --> 01:12:19,457
- To phone.
- Again?

791
01:12:23,541 --> 01:12:26,290
What a curse these women are!

792
01:12:26,458 --> 01:12:29,832
How right you are. He's hooked.

793
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,665
It's cost him dearly.
It's always been his trouble.

794
01:12:33,833 --> 01:12:36,124
But I can't do anything.

795
01:12:36,291 --> 01:12:38,665
Hello, Anaïs. It's Marcel.

796
01:12:39,208 --> 01:12:40,582
Any news?

797
01:12:42,375 --> 01:12:43,874
Since when?

798
01:12:44,208 --> 01:12:45,790
Really?

799
01:12:47,833 --> 01:12:49,124
I'm on my way.

800
01:12:56,791 --> 01:12:59,707
He had his father on his back.

801
01:13:01,250 --> 01:13:03,790
Six letters with an A.

802
01:13:04,375 --> 01:13:06,707
Aeneas.

803
01:13:07,375 --> 01:13:10,624
You're right!
It often comes up in crosswords.

804
01:13:12,541 --> 01:13:15,415
Belle, it's him again.
He's waiting for you.

805
01:13:26,916 --> 01:13:29,082
Hello. How are you?

806
01:13:35,625 --> 01:13:38,207
Where have you been?
And why?

807
01:13:38,833 --> 01:13:41,290
I had to go away for a few days.

808
01:13:41,458 --> 01:13:44,165
- I'll explain.
- I'll explain too.

809
01:13:44,333 --> 01:13:46,540
And leave my signature.

810
01:13:53,458 --> 01:13:55,457
Don't mark my face.

811
01:13:59,458 --> 01:14:02,374
If you do that again,
I'll go away forever.

812
01:14:05,416 --> 01:14:07,249
Okay for this time.

813
01:14:32,625 --> 01:14:34,290
I missed you, you know.

814
01:14:35,666 --> 01:14:38,040
I shouldn't say this,
but I waited for you.

815
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:42,040
Now I want to see more of you...
at night too.

816
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:44,415
You can see me every day.

817
01:14:45,708 --> 01:14:48,040
- You know I'm not free.
- I don't care.

818
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,540
I don't understand.

819
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:06,624
You seem to like being with me.

820
01:15:06,791 --> 01:15:09,832
Very much.
But it's not enough.

821
01:15:10,583 --> 01:15:12,665
You love the other guy?

822
01:15:14,166 --> 01:15:15,957
Why come here then?

823
01:15:16,125 --> 01:15:19,374
I don't know...
It's two different things.

824
01:15:44,583 --> 01:15:46,332
I'm starving.
Where shall we eat?

825
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:48,582
Let's decide on the way.

826
01:15:48,750 --> 01:15:51,374
I won't be long. I'll be back by 3.

827
01:15:52,833 --> 01:15:55,332
I scarcely recognize you.

828
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:58,832
- I'm so glad to see you smile.
- I certainly feel better.

829
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,749
I've never seen you like this.

830
01:16:00,916 --> 01:16:02,707
- If only...
- What?

831
01:16:03,083 --> 01:16:06,290
Oh, nothing. But if only you had
some great news for me one day.

832
01:16:06,458 --> 01:16:09,040
- What do you mean?
- You know very well...

833
01:16:09,208 --> 01:16:12,374
What I want most of all: a child.

834
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,832
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

835
01:16:31,583 --> 01:16:34,999
This thing. I don't know why.
It's odd.

836
01:16:35,166 --> 01:16:38,124
- Nothing odd about it.
- No, you're right.

837
01:16:46,708 --> 01:16:49,582
Hello, stranger!
I hardly recognized you.

838
01:16:49,750 --> 01:16:53,624
You forgot about us, didn't you?
We haven't seen you for ages.

839
01:16:54,250 --> 01:16:56,374
You haven't changed much.

840
01:16:56,541 --> 01:16:58,249
First door on the right.

841
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:05,582
Come here, girls.
It's an old friend.

842
01:17:08,041 --> 01:17:10,415
Come along. Get moving.

843
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:17,499
Yes, you're all lovely.

844
01:17:19,833 --> 01:17:22,082
- You flatter me.
- Not at all, Sir.

845
01:17:22,250 --> 01:17:24,040
I remember you very well.

846
01:17:24,208 --> 01:17:27,207
Sometimes, I even dream of you.

847
01:17:28,375 --> 01:17:30,207
I don't care much for that.

848
01:17:30,375 --> 01:17:32,707
- Oh no, Sir.
- I insist.

849
01:17:37,916 --> 01:17:39,999
Hello, ladies.
Please sit down.

850
01:17:40,583 --> 01:17:43,999
Mathilde, Charlotte
and Belle de Jour.

851
01:17:44,166 --> 01:17:46,999
Belle de Jour? Original name.

852
01:17:48,791 --> 01:17:50,915
Shall I get you a drink?

853
01:17:51,375 --> 01:17:52,915
Later on.

854
01:17:54,416 --> 01:17:56,082
Nothing has changed here.

855
01:17:56,250 --> 01:17:58,832
Still the same simple,
friendly welcome.

856
01:17:59,500 --> 01:18:01,374
The same curtains...

857
01:18:02,583 --> 01:18:05,165
What happened
to the lion tamer girl?

858
01:18:07,166 --> 01:18:08,415
I don't know.

859
01:18:08,583 --> 01:18:10,707
The heating's turned on full?

860
01:18:11,208 --> 01:18:12,665
You haven't changed either.

861
01:18:12,833 --> 01:18:14,790
And the armchair...

862
01:18:17,083 --> 01:18:18,624
It was snowing.

863
01:18:19,333 --> 01:18:21,582
Still the same unusual perfume.

864
01:18:21,750 --> 01:18:23,582
Faithful to jasmine...

865
01:18:24,125 --> 01:18:26,332
You'll stay for a while, I hope.

866
01:18:26,750 --> 01:18:28,957
All my life. I've plenty of time.

867
01:18:31,625 --> 01:18:34,165
I'd like to be alone
with Belle de Jour.

868
01:18:39,708 --> 01:18:41,582
No! I don't want to.

869
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,540
What is this?

870
01:18:43,708 --> 01:18:45,290
Stay here!

871
01:18:47,916 --> 01:18:49,999
She's very nice...

872
01:18:51,208 --> 01:18:53,457
But she can be a bit nervous.

873
01:18:56,875 --> 01:18:58,624
Pleased with yourself?

874
01:18:58,958 --> 01:19:01,249
You knew I was here.

875
01:19:01,666 --> 01:19:03,124
You are mistaken.

876
01:19:03,291 --> 01:19:06,124
It's your fault.
You gave me the address.

877
01:19:06,750 --> 01:19:08,915
- You're mistaken.
- Don't come near me

878
01:19:09,083 --> 01:19:11,332
or I'll jump out of the window.

879
01:19:17,916 --> 01:19:19,207
Is that your bed?

880
01:19:19,375 --> 01:19:21,249
You disgust me,
you know that.

881
01:19:21,416 --> 01:19:24,540
Yes, that's my bed.
What else do you want to know?

882
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:27,290
You like being humiliated.

883
01:19:27,458 --> 01:19:28,915
I don't.

884
01:19:30,541 --> 01:19:32,332
Don't tell Pierre!

885
01:19:32,875 --> 01:19:35,832
I admire him more and more.

886
01:19:37,291 --> 01:19:39,374
Please, don't tell him.

887
01:19:39,916 --> 01:19:42,165
Try to understand.

888
01:19:42,333 --> 01:19:43,790
I'm lost.

889
01:19:44,333 --> 01:19:47,707
It happens in spite of me.
I can't resist.

890
01:19:48,750 --> 01:19:51,665
One day I shall have to pay
for my sins.

891
01:19:52,666 --> 01:19:55,040
But without this I could not live.

892
01:19:56,833 --> 01:19:58,749
Do whatever you want with me.

893
01:20:00,916 --> 01:20:02,499
Not now, in any case...

894
01:20:02,958 --> 01:20:07,415
What attracted me about you was...
your virtue.

895
01:20:07,583 --> 01:20:11,249
You were the wife of a boy scout.
That has all changed.

896
01:20:12,041 --> 01:20:14,207
I have principles.
I am not like you.

897
01:20:14,375 --> 01:20:17,374
I shall, of course,
say nothing to Pierre.

898
01:20:18,416 --> 01:20:21,790
But I have friends
who would be good customers.

899
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:25,332
Forgive me.

900
01:20:25,666 --> 01:20:27,499
I really don't feel like it.

901
01:20:28,875 --> 01:20:30,915
Another time, perhaps.

902
01:20:31,083 --> 01:20:32,540
Who knows?

903
01:20:32,708 --> 01:20:34,749
I don't want to waste your time.

904
01:20:42,083 --> 01:20:45,832
This isn't for you. Buy some
chocolates for Pierre from me.

905
01:21:35,041 --> 01:21:37,082
All set? Go!

906
01:21:42,291 --> 01:21:43,749
Get ready.

907
01:21:44,291 --> 01:21:45,374
Fire!

908
01:22:24,208 --> 01:22:26,082
He's gone already?

909
01:22:26,958 --> 01:22:28,790
I want to speak to you.

910
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,207
Run along.

911
01:22:38,875 --> 01:22:40,707
- I must go away.
- When?

912
01:22:40,875 --> 01:22:43,499
- Now.
- You'll come back?

913
01:22:43,666 --> 01:22:45,665
- No, I won't.
- What?

914
01:22:46,791 --> 01:22:49,165
You might have told me
a little sooner.

915
01:22:49,333 --> 01:22:50,707
Aren't you happy here?

916
01:22:50,875 --> 01:22:52,707
Oh yes, only...

917
01:22:53,166 --> 01:22:54,749
Yes, I understand...

918
01:22:56,625 --> 01:22:58,249
It's Marcel.

919
01:22:59,166 --> 01:23:01,249
He was here just now.
He was furious.

920
01:23:01,416 --> 01:23:03,624
Nearly broke into your room.

921
01:23:04,416 --> 01:23:06,957
Something's not right.

922
01:23:07,833 --> 01:23:09,624
He's become too demanding.

923
01:23:09,791 --> 01:23:13,415
He wants you for himself
day and night.

924
01:23:17,541 --> 01:23:19,874
Always the same trouble with men.

925
01:23:21,125 --> 01:23:23,415
Go away. You're quite right.

926
01:23:24,166 --> 01:23:26,749
One of these days
there could be trouble.

927
01:23:27,833 --> 01:23:29,790
But I'll be sorry to lose you.

928
01:23:30,458 --> 01:23:32,499
Women like you are...

929
01:23:33,291 --> 01:23:36,707
- We got on well, you and me.
- Yes, that's true.

930
01:23:36,875 --> 01:23:40,832
Keep in touch if you can.
A phone call from time to time...

931
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,665
would make me very happy.

932
01:23:42,833 --> 01:23:44,915
- Can't you give me an address?
- No.

933
01:23:46,416 --> 01:23:48,790
Well, too bad. What can I say?

934
01:24:59,375 --> 01:25:01,665
A gentleman to see you,
Madame.

935
01:25:01,833 --> 01:25:03,332
- Me?
- Yes, Madame.

936
01:25:03,833 --> 01:25:05,124
Do you know him?

937
01:25:05,291 --> 01:25:08,082
No, Madame.
He says it's urgent.

938
01:25:17,750 --> 01:25:20,124
- Do you have the catalogue?
- Yes, Madame.

939
01:25:20,291 --> 01:25:21,124
Sit down.

940
01:25:21,291 --> 01:25:22,915
Thank you, Maria.

941
01:25:24,583 --> 01:25:26,665
Good idea, asking for a catalogue.

942
01:25:29,541 --> 01:25:31,040
Nice place you have.

943
01:25:31,208 --> 01:25:33,457
What are you doing here?
Go away!

944
01:25:33,625 --> 01:25:37,790
When I didn't see you any more,
I thought I'd pay you a visit...

945
01:25:37,958 --> 01:25:39,665
to see how you were.

946
01:25:40,458 --> 01:25:42,790
- How did you find me?
- Child's play.

947
01:25:43,333 --> 01:25:44,915
Your husband?

948
01:25:45,333 --> 01:25:48,082
Good-looking guy! Handsome!

949
01:25:49,625 --> 01:25:50,374
Much better than me.

950
01:25:50,541 --> 01:25:54,207
- Please go away!
- Don't worry. I won't make a fuss.

951
01:25:55,166 --> 01:25:57,415
I only wanted to know
why you left.

952
01:25:57,750 --> 01:26:00,790
- You hear?
- Don't shout. The maid will hear.

953
01:26:01,250 --> 01:26:03,082
Just go. He'll be back soon.

954
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,374
You're not very hospitable.

955
01:26:06,708 --> 01:26:08,582
- What do you want?
- To see you again.

956
01:26:08,750 --> 01:26:11,415
It's impossible.
I'm never going back there!

957
01:26:16,875 --> 01:26:18,582
I'll give you three days.

958
01:26:18,750 --> 01:26:20,790
Find an excuse. Anything.

959
01:26:20,958 --> 01:26:24,082
I'll meet you at the Hotel du Bois.
Rue Fromentin.

960
01:26:24,791 --> 01:26:26,415
You'll stay the night.

961
01:26:26,583 --> 01:26:27,790
It's impossible.

962
01:26:32,875 --> 01:26:35,249
Then I'll wait for him.

963
01:26:37,833 --> 01:26:39,290
I've lots to tell him.

964
01:26:39,458 --> 01:26:41,707
- You wouldn't do that!
- I would.

965
01:26:41,875 --> 01:26:44,415
I didn't want to,
but you force me to.

966
01:26:45,541 --> 01:26:47,832
After all, maybe it's for the best.

967
01:26:48,458 --> 01:26:51,332
- I'd decided to tell him all, too.
- Is that so?

968
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:53,665
He'd have found out sooner or later.

969
01:26:53,833 --> 01:26:55,957
A friend of ours saw me there.

970
01:26:56,333 --> 01:26:58,207
Anyhow, I've had enough.

971
01:27:00,375 --> 01:27:02,832
That's fine.
Let's wait for him.

972
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:06,457
We'll tell him everything together.
I don't mind.

973
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,499
Oh please!

974
01:27:17,875 --> 01:27:19,540
Go away before he comes.

975
01:27:32,875 --> 01:27:34,374
Don't be afraid.

976
01:27:35,166 --> 01:27:36,457
I'll go.

977
01:27:37,666 --> 01:27:40,249
I didn't believe you,
but I understand now.

978
01:27:45,458 --> 01:27:47,290
There's the obstacle.

979
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:57,374
See you soon.

980
01:28:34,625 --> 01:28:35,957
See her?

981
01:28:36,125 --> 01:28:37,832
Leave me the car.

982
01:28:38,208 --> 01:28:40,374
- Where are you going?
- I need it.

983
01:28:40,916 --> 01:28:43,332
Leave the car and get out.

984
01:28:43,833 --> 01:28:45,499
What are you up to?

985
01:28:47,083 --> 01:28:48,832
Get out, I tell you.

986
01:28:49,583 --> 01:28:52,790
This time, kid, I've had it.

987
01:30:17,208 --> 01:30:19,957
Hey, I won't let you run off
like that!

988
01:31:10,250 --> 01:31:11,290
Well?

989
01:31:11,458 --> 01:31:13,582
The killer's dead.
The police are baffled.

990
01:31:13,750 --> 01:31:16,290
He hit the wrong guy
or else he was mad.

991
01:31:16,458 --> 01:31:18,374
- Who was he?
- A gangster.

992
01:31:18,541 --> 01:31:21,582
- It seems he had quite a record.
- That's odd.

993
01:31:21,750 --> 01:31:24,124
- And how's Sérizy?
- It's too early to say.

994
01:31:24,291 --> 01:31:26,207
His wife's in the waiting room.

995
01:31:47,666 --> 01:31:49,165
How is he?

996
01:31:49,333 --> 01:31:52,457
Too early to say.
But he'll live.

997
01:31:52,791 --> 01:31:55,540
- May I see him?
- No. He's still in a coma.

998
01:31:55,708 --> 01:31:57,124
Tomorrow, perhaps.

999
01:31:57,291 --> 01:32:00,624
Go home and get some rest.

1000
01:32:00,791 --> 01:32:03,665
We'll keep you informed
every hour, I promise.

1001
01:32:05,541 --> 01:32:07,040
Don't worry.

1002
01:32:11,291 --> 01:32:13,332
Come along.
I'll go with you.

1003
01:33:22,166 --> 01:33:24,624
I've sent Marie out
for the newspapers.

1004
01:33:24,791 --> 01:33:27,374
I'll read you the articles
that interest you.

1005
01:33:29,750 --> 01:33:31,874
Marie is very kind.

1006
01:33:32,041 --> 01:33:33,749
She likes you a lot.

1007
01:33:36,875 --> 01:33:38,915
Everybody's asking about you.

1008
01:33:41,208 --> 01:33:42,707
You're much better.

1009
01:33:42,875 --> 01:33:44,957
The doctor is very optimistic.

1010
01:33:45,750 --> 01:33:48,665
You don't realize it,
but you're making great progress,

1011
01:33:48,833 --> 01:33:50,624
especially your eyes.

1012
01:33:52,083 --> 01:33:55,957
It's funny. Since your... accident,

1013
01:33:56,125 --> 01:33:57,707
I've not been dreaming.

1014
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,415
It's time for your medicine.

1015
01:34:29,291 --> 01:34:32,165
Monsieur Husson.
To see Monsieur Sérizy.

1016
01:34:38,208 --> 01:34:39,665
I'm coming.

1017
01:34:52,416 --> 01:34:54,290
I am very sorry to disturb you.

1018
01:34:54,791 --> 01:34:56,457
You want to see Pierre?

1019
01:34:56,625 --> 01:34:58,332
Just a moment.

1020
01:34:58,750 --> 01:35:01,665
He still can't speak. He is...

1021
01:35:01,833 --> 01:35:03,499
I know.

1022
01:35:03,666 --> 01:35:05,165
Sorry I didn't come sooner.

1023
01:35:05,333 --> 01:35:08,415
You know what I think of Pierre.
I was away on a trip.

1024
01:35:09,041 --> 01:35:10,499
A pretty dress!

1025
01:35:11,708 --> 01:35:14,415
Like a precocious schoolgirl.

1026
01:35:16,041 --> 01:35:19,124
- What will you tell him?
- Everything I know about you.

1027
01:35:20,541 --> 01:35:21,957
Keep calm!

1028
01:35:23,125 --> 01:35:26,999
He's paralysed
and feels he's a burden to you.

1029
01:35:29,375 --> 01:35:32,165
That makes him ashamed,
because he thinks you're pure.

1030
01:35:32,333 --> 01:35:35,165
That's why I want to tell him
everything.

1031
01:35:36,541 --> 01:35:39,374
It will hurt him...
but it will be for the best.

1032
01:35:42,625 --> 01:35:45,249
Who could accuse me
of being cruel?

1033
01:35:48,291 --> 01:35:49,999
Show me in, please.

1034
01:35:52,583 --> 01:35:54,040
He's through there.

1035
01:35:59,708 --> 01:36:02,332
Do you want to be present?

1036
01:38:30,583 --> 01:38:31,999
What are you thinking about?

1037
01:38:34,833 --> 01:38:36,499
About you, Pierre.

1038
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:39,165
I'm thirsty.

1039
01:38:58,416 --> 01:38:59,832
Shall I get some ice?

1040
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,707
No, don't bother.

1041
01:39:03,500 --> 01:39:06,332
I think I can take
two weeks off in February.

1042
01:39:06,500 --> 01:39:08,915
- To go to the mountains?
- If you want.

1043
01:39:22,041 --> 01:39:23,749
Do you hear that?

1044
01:39:58,958 --> 01:40:03,957
THE END
