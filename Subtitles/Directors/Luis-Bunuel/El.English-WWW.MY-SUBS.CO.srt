THIS STRANGE PASSION

3
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,093
Francisco!

4
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:51,802
- I thought you had gone.
- You see I'm still here.

5
00:05:52,017 --> 00:05:56,609
Some friends of mine
want to meet you.

6
00:06:00,403 --> 00:06:03,773
Padre Velasco speaks
highly of you.

7
00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:07,291
Delighted... I'm afraid
I must go.

8
00:06:07,499 --> 00:06:09,932
Why so fast? Do you want
to slight my friends?

9
00:06:10,109 --> 00:06:14,523
I don't mean to, but I must attend
to something very important.

10
00:06:14,737 --> 00:06:18,628
If it's important
it's not for good Christians!

11
00:06:18,842 --> 00:06:20,539
We absolve you!

12
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:23,152
We'll see each other
some other time.

13
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:27,008
Many thanks, padres.
You will excuse me, won't you?

14
00:07:17,686 --> 00:07:19,309
Come in, Sir.

15
00:07:20,298 --> 00:07:21,430
May I?

16
00:07:24,605 --> 00:07:25,887
Follow me, please.

17
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:38,860
Sir, your lawyer's here.

18
00:07:39,078 --> 00:07:41,997
Send him in and leave us alone.

19
00:07:45,236 --> 00:07:46,897
- How are you?
- Waiting for you.

20
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:51,008
You're late.
I was about to call you.

21
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:55,599
Sorry, I couldn't get the files till
this morning because of Holy Week.

22
00:07:55,812 --> 00:07:58,518
Don't worry. Sit down, please.

23
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,304
Good news?

24
00:08:03,397 --> 00:08:05,651
Just the opposite.

25
00:08:05,867 --> 00:08:07,849
- How come?
- Try to understand...

26
00:08:08,025 --> 00:08:12,438
millions of dollars are involved and
the other side doesn't want to lose.

27
00:08:12,652 --> 00:08:15,286
The Devil take them!
That land is mine...

28
00:08:15,714 --> 00:08:19,783
The buildings and even some
of Guanajuato streets are mine, too.

29
00:08:20,097 --> 00:08:22,423
Our papers prove it!

30
00:08:22,637 --> 00:08:25,378
Yes, but the documents
are too old...

31
00:08:25,804 --> 00:08:30,491
they're from the early 19th Century.

32
00:08:30,813 --> 00:08:32,723
To go on fighting is mad!

33
00:08:32,936 --> 00:08:36,377
Mad? Choosing you
for my lawyer was mad!

34
00:08:36,971 --> 00:08:38,669
It's useless to talk further.

35
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:42,005
Send back my documents
with your account.

36
00:08:43,999 --> 00:08:45,981
But I did all I could.

37
00:08:51,237 --> 00:08:52,246
Pablo!

38
00:08:52,802 --> 00:08:55,199
Never mind,
I'll see you out myself.

39
00:08:55,376 --> 00:08:57,358
You're excited, Don Francisco...

40
00:08:57,533 --> 00:09:01,176
take a friend's advice.
Drop the case!

41
00:09:01,396 --> 00:09:05,952
If this were a simple matter,
I'd have handled it myself.

42
00:09:06,127 --> 00:09:08,417
I thought you were
a smart attorney.

43
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:12,179
I'll find someone
who'll win the case.

44
00:09:12,598 --> 00:09:13,952
Good afternoon!

45
00:09:26,838 --> 00:09:28,265
What's going on, Martha?

46
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,566
What happened? Answer me!

47
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,964
Ask Pablo.

48
00:09:45,176 --> 00:09:46,979
What happened with Martha?

49
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:49,236
Permit me to explain, señor.

50
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:51,853
No excuses!
I can imagine what went on!

51
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:55,092
I won't tolerate
such disgrace into my home!

52
00:09:55,927 --> 00:09:57,695
No excuses, I told you!

53
00:09:57,875 --> 00:10:00,581
Señor, forgive me

54
00:10:00,797 --> 00:10:02,293
but sometimes, well...

55
00:10:03,963 --> 00:10:07,547
You know that no one cares about
and respects you more than I.

56
00:10:07,755 --> 00:10:10,461
That's why I don't let you go.

57
00:10:10,714 --> 00:10:13,455
But this can't happen again.

58
00:10:13,671 --> 00:10:17,005
- Fire that girl today!
- As you wish, señor.

59
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:25,046
Are you ill? Bad news?

60
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:28,038
I thought my lawyer was honest...

61
00:10:28,526 --> 00:10:31,647
but he sold out to the other side.

62
00:10:31,901 --> 00:10:33,599
It's not the first time.

63
00:10:33,849 --> 00:10:36,388
You're too good, Sir.

64
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:40,172
They take advantage
of your good nature.

65
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:42,470
But don't worry.

66
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:47,140
You'll get back your land.

67
00:10:48,107 --> 00:10:52,112
Now try to rest...

68
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:54,756
There.

69
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:59,239
Straighten that picture!

70
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:04,495
It's perfect. Anything else?

71
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:06,064
No, leave.

72
00:12:31,489 --> 00:12:37,084
I've come every morning, every
afternoon, since that first day.

73
00:12:37,467 --> 00:12:39,900
I knew I'd find you here again.

74
00:13:24,143 --> 00:13:27,822
But for a moment I thought
I had lost you forever.

75
00:13:28,214 --> 00:13:31,477
Please! I must go.

76
00:13:31,694 --> 00:13:35,479
I must know your name...
and when we'll meet again...

77
00:13:35,695 --> 00:13:38,613
- No. It's impossible.
- Impossible?

78
00:13:39,648 --> 00:13:41,938
You came
because you knew I'd be here.

79
00:13:42,327 --> 00:13:44,131
You were waiting for me...

80
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:48,265
- Then?
- I don't know why I came.

81
00:13:51,129 --> 00:13:53,004
Ask no more questions.

82
00:13:53,694 --> 00:13:55,328
I can't see you any more.

83
00:14:14,829 --> 00:14:16,555
Follow that car!

84
00:15:10,857 --> 00:15:12,281
Good afternoon, Mr engineer.

85
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:16,899
Francisco! Good to see you!
To what do I owe the honor?

86
00:15:17,154 --> 00:15:20,832
It's been a while and since Mohammed
wouldn't come to the mountain...

87
00:15:21,016 --> 00:15:24,979
I guess I deserve that. I've been
too busy for anything. Come in.

88
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:28,039
I read about that dam
you're building.

89
00:15:28,252 --> 00:15:31,349
A hopelessly complicated job.

90
00:15:31,592 --> 00:15:33,776
But how's your suit coming?

91
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:36,248
Fine. Can you do me a favor?

92
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,901
I need to know the value
of all the suit's properties.

93
00:15:40,082 --> 00:15:41,850
And since
I don't trust strangers...

94
00:15:42,065 --> 00:15:45,707
Do you know a reliable appraiser
who could assess my properties?

95
00:15:45,892 --> 00:15:48,075
Sure thing!
When do you want to see him?

96
00:15:48,258 --> 00:15:50,335
- Tomorrow, if possible.
- It's done.

97
00:15:50,554 --> 00:15:52,429
- Thank you.
- Come and sit down.

98
00:15:53,615 --> 00:15:58,172
I know you're busy, Raul, but I'll
wager you still run around some.

99
00:15:58,347 --> 00:16:01,230
No more. I'm in love.

100
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,720
Since when?

101
00:16:03,828 --> 00:16:08,206
I guess it's news to you...
I'll be married soon.

102
00:16:08,526 --> 00:16:11,753
A well-guarded secret!
Do I know her?

103
00:16:11,935 --> 00:16:15,198
No. She lived in Argentina
until recently.

104
00:16:15,415 --> 00:16:16,625
I'd like to meet her.

105
00:16:16,806 --> 00:16:18,680
You will when I return.

106
00:16:20,111 --> 00:16:21,500
Return? From where?

107
00:16:21,712 --> 00:16:23,789
I'm leaving for the dam site
in two days.

108
00:16:23,973 --> 00:16:27,865
Too bad. I'd have liked
to talk with you more.

109
00:16:28,218 --> 00:16:30,887
- But if you must go...
- Duty calls!

110
00:16:31,732 --> 00:16:34,615
Well, I won't take up
any more of your time...

111
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:38,470
It certainly was an unexpected
pleasure seeing you.

112
00:16:38,656 --> 00:16:41,812
Look! Why don't you come
to dinner tomorrow night.

113
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,161
I've invited some old friends.

114
00:16:45,335 --> 00:16:47,732
Sorry. I have to take
my girl to dinner...

115
00:16:47,944 --> 00:16:50,448
and her mother goes along.

116
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:56,980
Swell! Bring them both.

117
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,833
I'll make love to the mother!

118
00:17:00,156 --> 00:17:01,438
You're making things so simple.

119
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:04,050
- Deal?
- Deal.

120
00:17:33,382 --> 00:17:36,859
You're very beautiful tonight,
and I love you so...

121
00:17:39,781 --> 00:17:41,172
But why so quiet?

122
00:17:42,259 --> 00:17:46,917
Raul, take me with you to
the dam site. Don't leave me alone.

123
00:17:47,047 --> 00:17:49,202
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

124
00:17:49,332 --> 00:17:50,596
What's wrong?

125
00:17:50,883 --> 00:17:54,039
Nothing! The idea's wonderful.

126
00:17:54,257 --> 00:17:55,325
I'm ready!

127
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:00,834
Señora, Gloria has a great idea!

128
00:18:01,912 --> 00:18:04,867
She wants to go with me
and you to the dam site.

129
00:18:05,077 --> 00:18:08,198
It's crazy!
The two of us, darling?

130
00:18:08,418 --> 00:18:13,176
I'm tired of the city, Mother. A few
days in the country would be fine.

131
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:15,303
But there'd be no accommodations...

132
00:18:15,515 --> 00:18:17,912
- I want to go, mother.
- Say yes, señora.

133
00:18:18,089 --> 00:18:19,787
But... it's so sudden!

134
00:18:20,038 --> 00:18:23,408
Let's talk about it on the way.

135
00:18:23,622 --> 00:18:26,126
My friend will be furious
if we're late.

136
00:18:26,822 --> 00:18:27,831
Let's go!

137
00:18:36,356 --> 00:18:38,195
- Martini?
- Yes, Señora.

138
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:40,948
No alcohol for me,
bring me a soft drink.

139
00:18:41,157 --> 00:18:42,582
Of course, padre.

140
00:18:51,629 --> 00:18:52,983
A cigarette?

141
00:19:01,823 --> 00:19:03,282
Will you excuse me?

142
00:19:08,085 --> 00:19:10,719
- Here we are, Francisco.
- I'm glad you could come.

143
00:19:10,904 --> 00:19:14,546
We rushed all the way. I remembered
how you liked punctuality.

144
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,155
I'll introduce you...

145
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:26,205
Make yourselves at home.

146
00:19:44,025 --> 00:19:46,458
I've always wondered
how an architect

147
00:19:46,635 --> 00:19:49,103
could have dreamed up
such odd ideas.

148
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:52,787
Sentiment, emotion and instinct,

149
00:19:53,002 --> 00:19:56,063
rather than reason,
must have guided him.

150
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:58,943
It's quite odd, indeed.

151
00:19:59,369 --> 00:20:03,332
This house was built
by Francisco's father

152
00:20:03,544 --> 00:20:05,798
on his return from Paris in 1900.

153
00:20:06,014 --> 00:20:11,056
He wasn't an architect, but an
engineer helped him with the plans.

154
00:20:11,267 --> 00:20:14,008
He must have been
original and moody.

155
00:20:14,224 --> 00:20:18,424
Just the opposite of Francisco,
who is so normal and level-headed.

156
00:20:19,304 --> 00:20:21,357
That's the truth, padre...

157
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:26,435
Francisco hasn't changed
since we were boys together.

158
00:20:31,203 --> 00:20:34,015
Nothing to drink?
Can I bring you something?

159
00:20:36,317 --> 00:20:40,517
Allow me to sit by your side.
I must talk to you.

160
00:20:41,153 --> 00:20:44,108
Did you arrange all this?

161
00:20:44,633 --> 00:20:47,030
Surely it was no coincidence.

162
00:20:48,425 --> 00:20:51,581
I had no alternative...

163
00:20:52,147 --> 00:20:54,746
but please hear my first...

164
00:20:57,262 --> 00:20:58,817
Dinner is served, señor.

165
00:20:59,001 --> 00:21:00,699
Very well, let us go in.

166
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,334
If you like, we can have dinner.

167
00:21:05,508 --> 00:21:06,718
That's a good idea.

168
00:21:06,934 --> 00:21:11,526
Swell. I'm hungry as a dog.

169
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:14,134
Señora, this way.

170
00:21:14,762 --> 00:21:17,788
- Padrecito, it's dinner time.
- Much obliged.

171
00:21:29,433 --> 00:21:31,617
What's the matter, Gloria?

172
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:33,042
Nothing, why?

173
00:21:33,262 --> 00:21:35,374
You seem preoccupied.

174
00:21:35,592 --> 00:21:37,574
Me? Just the opposite.

175
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:38,996
Just the opposite?

176
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:42,541
Only lovers secrets, padre.

177
00:21:45,439 --> 00:21:48,286
- What do you say, Francisco?
- I envy Raul.

178
00:21:48,988 --> 00:21:50,234
Do as he did.

179
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:52,948
It's very difficult, señora.

180
00:21:53,163 --> 00:21:55,073
Not for a man like you.

181
00:21:55,285 --> 00:21:58,346
How could a single girl resist you?

182
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,802
You are very gracious.

183
00:22:00,051 --> 00:22:03,492
But I hold
a highly singular view of love.

184
00:22:03,843 --> 00:22:05,019
For instance?

185
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,507
I don't believe in set love, which
apparently grows up with time.

186
00:22:10,264 --> 00:22:14,677
Love must spring up with its
own force, when two people meet,

187
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:16,908
and know that nothing
can part them.

188
00:22:17,117 --> 00:22:21,246
That's love at first sight.
A poisoned arrow!

189
00:22:21,953 --> 00:22:22,985
I don't recommend it.

190
00:22:23,553 --> 00:22:28,110
It takes time to fashion such an
arrow, time to prepare such a love.

191
00:22:28,911 --> 00:22:31,616
This love must be
nurtured from infancy.

192
00:22:32,146 --> 00:22:34,259
A man walks past
a thousand women...

193
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:38,120
then suddenly meets one...
that instinctive one!

194
00:22:38,618 --> 00:22:44,183
She fulfills the dream,
answers the longing...

195
00:22:44,498 --> 00:22:47,037
This is man's lifetime wishes.

196
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:51,082
If such a love, my son,
is not reciprocal?

197
00:22:51,292 --> 00:22:53,289
What would you do
if she didn't love you?

198
00:22:53,419 --> 00:22:54,541
She ought to!

199
00:22:55,253 --> 00:22:59,732
Come on, you're not that romantic!
What do you think padre?

200
00:23:00,225 --> 00:23:04,674
My thoughts on love are sober...
but the turkey is excellent.

201
00:24:04,018 --> 00:24:05,227
What are you doing in here?

202
00:24:05,442 --> 00:24:08,468
Looking for a bridge table, señor.

203
00:24:08,678 --> 00:24:11,217
Get out and close the door!

204
00:24:59,126 --> 00:25:04,063
My grandfather built this house.
He liked to live near trees.

205
00:25:04,623 --> 00:25:09,346
Something in me loves trees, too.

206
00:25:27,238 --> 00:25:28,305
Gloria!

207
00:26:34,488 --> 00:26:38,591
Your plane ticket, señor.
The car is waiting.

208
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:41,091
Thanks. I won't be long.

209
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:46,693
This is a fine time to make changes.
It'll cost a fortune.

210
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:48,046
When will you return?

211
00:26:48,263 --> 00:26:51,562
I don't know. These things drag on,
need discussing...

212
00:26:51,741 --> 00:26:55,182
You'll enjoy
seeing Mexico City again.

213
00:26:55,395 --> 00:26:57,021
You've been away a long time...

214
00:26:57,204 --> 00:26:59,388
I wish it were forever.

215
00:27:48,729 --> 00:27:51,362
Gloria! I didn't expect
to see you so soon!

216
00:27:51,547 --> 00:27:53,042
Neither did I.

217
00:27:53,322 --> 00:27:54,497
How are you?

218
00:27:54,678 --> 00:27:57,217
Very well, and you?

219
00:27:59,097 --> 00:28:00,272
Is anything wrong?

220
00:28:01,393 --> 00:28:03,411
No. I just don't feel well.

221
00:28:03,794 --> 00:28:06,226
- Want a ride home?
- No. Not that!

222
00:28:07,029 --> 00:28:11,028
I must go, Raul. Leave me...
please... forget our having met.

223
00:28:11,795 --> 00:28:15,307
Excuse me for bothering you.
But don't forget...

224
00:28:16,214 --> 00:28:18,956
I'm still your friend.

225
00:28:19,172 --> 00:28:21,284
Count on me
if you ever need help.

226
00:28:34,341 --> 00:28:36,251
Raul... wait!

227
00:28:43,108 --> 00:28:45,991
I don't know
if I'm doing right or wrong...

228
00:28:46,449 --> 00:28:48,502
but I can't go on!

229
00:28:48,709 --> 00:28:51,308
So it's something serious!

230
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:55,005
Take me home. Who cares!

231
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:57,402
We can speak as we ride.

232
00:29:07,184 --> 00:29:10,447
You can imagine how I feel,
telling you,

233
00:29:10,628 --> 00:29:12,681
the last person
who should hear this!

234
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:17,161
Don't feel badly, Gloria.
You were frank with me...

235
00:29:17,447 --> 00:29:19,631
what could I do
if you loved him more?

236
00:29:19,813 --> 00:29:22,910
If he knew I was with you
I don't know what he'd do...

237
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:27,806
Forgive me, but if he's that bad,
why did you marry him?

238
00:29:28,442 --> 00:29:31,111
Because I was fooled...
like the others!

239
00:29:31,539 --> 00:29:36,439
They all love and respect him. They
don't know what he's really like.

240
00:29:37,557 --> 00:29:40,856
My first surprise
came on our wedding night...

241
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,157
on the way to Guanajuato.

242
00:29:44,585 --> 00:29:48,264
He wanted to spend
our honeymoon there...

243
00:30:02,886 --> 00:30:04,939
- Is that you?
- May I come in?

244
00:30:15,028 --> 00:30:17,140
How beautiful you are, Gloria.

245
00:30:18,055 --> 00:30:20,653
How I've dreamed of this moment!

246
00:30:21,499 --> 00:30:24,002
I'm desperately in love with you.

247
00:30:24,213 --> 00:30:26,017
And I, with you.

248
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:28,660
We'll be very happy, won't we?

249
00:30:38,087 --> 00:30:40,825
What are you thinking of?

250
00:30:42,642 --> 00:30:43,709
You.

251
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:49,114
Tell me the truth,
who are you thinking of?

252
00:30:50,923 --> 00:30:53,557
Really. I'm thinking of you.

253
00:30:55,649 --> 00:30:57,112
You're lying!

254
00:30:58,542 --> 00:31:01,248
Lying?
Who else should I think of?

255
00:31:03,343 --> 00:31:04,343
Raul.

256
00:31:05,467 --> 00:31:06,603
Are you crazy?

257
00:31:07,483 --> 00:31:09,393
Why do you imagine such things?

258
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,886
It's natural.

259
00:31:11,207 --> 00:31:15,799
You loved him, you were engaged
and about to marry.

260
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:18,120
Didn't I leave him for you?

261
00:31:18,407 --> 00:31:20,911
A whim! You must have kissed...

262
00:31:22,444 --> 00:31:25,991
and embraced each other
many times.

263
00:31:27,071 --> 00:31:29,610
Don't tell me
there weren't others!

264
00:31:30,063 --> 00:31:31,831
Raul wasn't the first!

265
00:31:32,012 --> 00:31:34,681
You're insulting me.
Please, keep still!

266
00:31:34,899 --> 00:31:36,917
Gloria, I want the truth!

267
00:31:37,091 --> 00:31:40,046
Doubts will make me bitter.
I have to know!

268
00:31:40,257 --> 00:31:42,334
I swear I'll forget everything

269
00:31:42,553 --> 00:31:45,710
and hold nothing against you...

270
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:48,743
tell me as your confessor.
I'm your husband.

271
00:31:48,955 --> 00:31:53,084
No more... please I've never done
anything to be ashamed of.

272
00:31:54,278 --> 00:31:59,178
You refuse to tell me! Can't you see
that you're increasing my doubts?

273
00:32:03,289 --> 00:32:06,386
Well, keep your past hidden.

274
00:32:06,977 --> 00:32:08,852
I'll find out some day.

275
00:32:43,691 --> 00:32:46,837
Gloria, forgive me!

276
00:33:09,742 --> 00:33:13,112
- Guanajuato is beautiful, isn't it?
- Yes, it's wonderful.

277
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:16,873
I always liked the view from here.
I love the height...

278
00:33:17,082 --> 00:33:21,247
it makes things
look pure and clean.

279
00:33:22,754 --> 00:33:25,910
See that big house
standing out from the others?

280
00:33:27,241 --> 00:33:30,504
All of them
belonged to my family.

281
00:33:30,964 --> 00:33:34,061
My grandfather
was robbed of them...

282
00:33:34,269 --> 00:33:37,496
if there is justice here,
they will be returned to me.

283
00:33:47,595 --> 00:33:48,877
How are you, Ricardo?

284
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:53,054
Small world!
What a surprise to find you here!

285
00:33:53,265 --> 00:33:55,520
We arrived this morning.

286
00:33:55,735 --> 00:33:57,753
Ricardo Lujan, my husband.

287
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:02,448
Congratulations. I read about
the wedding in the newspapers.

288
00:34:02,659 --> 00:34:06,587
I envy you, señor,
Gloria is a rare woman.

289
00:34:08,052 --> 00:34:10,164
How do you like Guanajuato?

290
00:34:10,418 --> 00:34:14,132
You must excuse us.
We have things to do.

291
00:34:14,558 --> 00:34:16,885
I'll be seeing you, Ricardo.

292
00:34:26,805 --> 00:34:29,024
Who is that guy?
Where did you meet him?

293
00:34:29,241 --> 00:34:31,318
We met on the plane
from Buenos Aires.

294
00:34:31,537 --> 00:34:33,162
I saw him a few times.

295
00:34:33,346 --> 00:34:35,399
Why were you rude to him?
He's nice.

296
00:34:35,608 --> 00:34:39,084
He seems like a pest.
I'll bet he thinks he's a Don Juan.

297
00:34:39,296 --> 00:34:41,479
Don't be so cordial
if we meet him again.

298
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:44,616
He might take your good manners
for something else.

299
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,186
It's my turn now.

300
00:35:02,316 --> 00:35:05,944
Wait! I'll take you
to a better place.

301
00:35:12,035 --> 00:35:14,467
- It's done.
- Now it's your turn.

302
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:28,100
Forget it. I'll snap your picture
some other time.

303
00:35:28,282 --> 00:35:29,493
Let's eat.

304
00:35:54,511 --> 00:35:55,618
What's the matter?

305
00:35:55,851 --> 00:35:58,162
I don't want to meet
that man again.

306
00:36:19,878 --> 00:36:21,896
The dinner, or a la carte?

307
00:36:22,105 --> 00:36:23,529
The dinner.

308
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:27,109
The menu looks good.

309
00:36:29,132 --> 00:36:31,245
You're pretty, Gloria.

310
00:36:31,734 --> 00:36:36,291
I like your hair that short.
So curly and silky.

311
00:36:36,467 --> 00:36:38,544
- Do you really like it?
- A lot.

312
00:36:39,389 --> 00:36:41,573
Do you know
what I adore about you?

313
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:43,415
What I love the most in you?

314
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:45,996
Yes, tell me.

315
00:36:46,243 --> 00:36:47,489
Your sweetness.

316
00:36:47,878 --> 00:36:51,806
Especially that aura
of kindness, of resignation...

317
00:36:54,627 --> 00:36:58,555
How curious!
My mother thought otherwise.

318
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:08,297
Do you know
what I like most about you?

319
00:37:09,545 --> 00:37:14,518
Your self-assurance. It attracted me
from the very first moment...

320
00:37:14,731 --> 00:37:16,713
You make me feel dangerous.

321
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,768
Now tell me truth:

322
00:37:19,984 --> 00:37:22,939
what do you dislike about me?

323
00:37:24,333 --> 00:37:26,350
There's nothing
I dislike about you.

324
00:37:26,525 --> 00:37:28,779
There must be something,
nobody's perfect.

325
00:37:29,586 --> 00:37:31,983
Well, there's one thing:

326
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:35,114
sometimes you're a bit unfair.

327
00:37:36,335 --> 00:37:39,705
Nonsense!
I don't have that fault.

328
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:45,137
Few men possess so keen
a sense of justice as I.

329
00:37:54,845 --> 00:37:56,957
- How was your stroll?
- Very pleasant.

330
00:37:57,176 --> 00:37:59,573
- Splendid day, isn't it?
- Marvellous!

331
00:37:59,785 --> 00:38:02,111
Ideal for newlyweds.

332
00:38:03,613 --> 00:38:06,639
Well, so long.
I'll be seeing you.

333
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:11,607
That guy's following you.

334
00:38:11,963 --> 00:38:17,278
Ridiculous. It's your imagination.
He's probably staying at this hotel.

335
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,643
Maybe. But, I doubt it.

336
00:38:22,887 --> 00:38:26,434
I'll have a steak...
and a cold glass of dark beer.

337
00:38:32,629 --> 00:38:36,593
He's more brazen than I thought.
Now he's working at you.

338
00:38:36,804 --> 00:38:38,917
Are you sure? It's impossible.

339
00:38:39,135 --> 00:38:42,718
I saw him. Don't look at him.

340
00:38:43,101 --> 00:38:44,490
Don't smile at him either.

341
00:38:46,302 --> 00:38:47,928
Ignore him.

342
00:38:52,703 --> 00:38:55,729
That's the limit,
he's laughing at me.

343
00:38:56,043 --> 00:38:57,075
Let's go!

344
00:38:57,295 --> 00:39:00,037
- Francisco, please!
- I said lets go!

345
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:01,881
And be discreet.

346
00:39:05,298 --> 00:39:08,525
- Aren't you going to eat?
- We'll dine in our room.

347
00:39:26,955 --> 00:39:28,942
Would you care to write Mother?

348
00:39:29,291 --> 00:39:32,388
It's not necessary.
Send her my regards.

349
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:36,899
They're late with the coffee.

350
00:39:37,902 --> 00:39:41,888
I can do without it.
Anyway, the bell's out of order.

351
00:39:42,107 --> 00:39:45,431
What miserable service!
I'll go myself.

352
00:40:17,071 --> 00:40:19,150
Do you know
who's behind that door?

353
00:40:19,405 --> 00:40:21,422
- Who?
- Now tell me I'm wrong.

354
00:40:21,631 --> 00:40:24,134
It's that guy... he's living there!

355
00:40:24,345 --> 00:40:26,671
- It's impossible!
- I just saw him.

356
00:40:26,919 --> 00:40:28,759
He checked in before we arrived.

357
00:40:28,973 --> 00:40:33,351
He switched his room to be near us
because he likes you.

358
00:40:47,323 --> 00:40:49,110
Come here! Come here!

359
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:51,550
He's watching us.

360
00:40:57,849 --> 00:41:00,068
What are you going to do?

361
00:41:07,243 --> 00:41:08,418
He went away!

362
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:12,277
I'll put an end to this...

363
00:41:22,064 --> 00:41:23,868
Oh, it's you. Come in!

364
00:41:24,047 --> 00:41:26,231
- Don't get sarcastic!
- I beg your pardon?

365
00:41:26,448 --> 00:41:29,189
I'll teach you to respect my wife!

366
00:41:39,773 --> 00:41:42,100
Don't hit a man when he's down!

367
00:41:42,313 --> 00:41:44,568
- Keep still!
- What's happening?

368
00:41:46,175 --> 00:41:48,464
What happened?

369
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,449
This man hit him.

370
00:41:50,628 --> 00:41:54,069
He insulted me without provocation.
Then he struck me.

371
00:41:54,246 --> 00:41:56,359
What happened, Don Francisco?

372
00:41:58,152 --> 00:42:02,281
I come here, my hometown,
for my honeymoon...

373
00:42:02,483 --> 00:42:06,314
and this dog tried to spy on us.

374
00:42:06,444 --> 00:42:07,993
- That's a lie!
- Keep quiet!

375
00:42:08,237 --> 00:42:10,455
Had it been me,
I'd have shot you.

376
00:42:10,637 --> 00:42:12,476
Pack up and leave at once!

377
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:14,458
It's all a mistake!

378
00:42:14,638 --> 00:42:16,062
Leave at once!

379
00:42:16,531 --> 00:42:18,427
You heard him. Go.

380
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,108
I'm terribly sorry, Don Francisco.

381
00:42:21,318 --> 00:42:23,193
I'll send for the doctor.

382
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,280
This won't happen again.

383
00:42:30,921 --> 00:42:34,183
Wait, Francisco.
I have something here!

384
00:42:43,272 --> 00:42:47,650
It's your fault...

385
00:42:48,958 --> 00:42:51,090
I'll never forgive you!

386
00:42:53,593 --> 00:42:57,947
That's how we began,
Francisco and I...

387
00:42:59,677 --> 00:43:04,506
Three weeks later we went back
home without any good memories.

388
00:43:04,722 --> 00:43:07,155
Mother was waiting for us
at home...

389
00:43:09,384 --> 00:43:11,045
How I longed to see you!

390
00:43:11,263 --> 00:43:12,853
Me too, Mother.

391
00:43:14,046 --> 00:43:17,108
You can't imagine
how much I missed you!

392
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:20,132
You know,
it's the first time we're apart.

393
00:43:20,343 --> 00:43:21,554
I do understand.

394
00:43:21,735 --> 00:43:23,717
So, how was it?

395
00:43:24,449 --> 00:43:25,067
Fine...

396
00:43:25,284 --> 00:43:27,267
Fine? Fantastic!

397
00:43:27,476 --> 00:43:30,110
- You must be exhausted.
- Yes, a little.

398
00:43:30,294 --> 00:43:33,628
Our train had a four hour delay,
unbearable!

399
00:43:33,843 --> 00:43:37,178
If you'll excuse us,
we're going to get changed.

400
00:43:37,391 --> 00:43:41,520
We have so much to tell,
I'll be back in 10 minutes.

401
00:43:42,645 --> 00:43:44,413
Will you have lunch with us?

402
00:43:44,593 --> 00:43:46,504
Of course!

403
00:43:46,715 --> 00:43:48,792
Then, you'll excuse us.

404
00:44:28,118 --> 00:44:31,073
What's the matter?
What are they doing?

405
00:44:31,203 --> 00:44:33,337
Don Francisco
ask you to forgive them,

406
00:44:33,511 --> 00:44:35,837
Doña Gloria felt indisposed
and went to bed.

407
00:44:36,642 --> 00:44:38,897
- To bed?
- Yes, Señora.

408
00:44:39,112 --> 00:44:41,510
That's impossible,
I'm going to see her.

409
00:44:42,034 --> 00:44:46,342
Excuse me, señora, Don Francisco
doesn't want to be disturbed.

410
00:44:52,124 --> 00:44:54,451
Would you like your lunch now?

411
00:45:01,344 --> 00:45:03,219
He didn't allow me to go down,

412
00:45:03,431 --> 00:45:07,810
he hated me even if he pretended
no to in front of me.

413
00:45:08,511 --> 00:45:11,109
He didn't allow me
to see anyone for months,

414
00:45:11,363 --> 00:45:14,460
until one day
he came to see me amiably.

415
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:19,361
Congratulations, Gloria!
I didn't forget your birthday.

416
00:45:22,253 --> 00:45:24,686
I want you to be
as happy as I am today.

417
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:27,047
Here's something for you!

418
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:32,690
Do you know why I'm so happy?
I just spoke to my lawyer...

419
00:45:33,005 --> 00:45:37,763
although he's young, he has quite
a reputation, and much influence.

420
00:45:38,745 --> 00:45:42,387
Perfume, my favorite, thank you!

421
00:45:42,850 --> 00:45:46,778
As I was saying, he thinks
my law suit can be won...

422
00:45:46,991 --> 00:45:49,732
and I'll have my land back
in two months!

423
00:45:49,948 --> 00:45:51,158
I'm glad to hear it.

424
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:54,401
I asked him for dinner tonight.

425
00:45:54,610 --> 00:45:55,963
Who? Your attorney?

426
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:59,297
Why not? I want to make
friends with him...

427
00:45:59,654 --> 00:46:03,368
so be a perfect hostess tonight...

428
00:46:03,586 --> 00:46:05,639
and charge it up
to victory, alright?

429
00:46:05,813 --> 00:46:07,308
I'll be glad to.

430
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:09,950
Then I'll call him up...

431
00:46:11,205 --> 00:46:15,726
You'll be happy to hear this,
I invited your mother as well.

432
00:46:16,146 --> 00:46:16,799
Really?

433
00:46:17,015 --> 00:46:19,270
Of course darling, I do like her

434
00:46:19,451 --> 00:46:23,521
but I don't want anyone
to interfere with our private life.

435
00:46:23,651 --> 00:46:24,941
Am I wrong?

436
00:46:26,166 --> 00:46:29,192
I want you to be very happy tonight.

437
00:46:43,991 --> 00:46:46,066
May I take her away
for a moment?

438
00:46:48,155 --> 00:46:51,869
- The lawyer is alone.
- I was with him a moment ago.

439
00:46:52,086 --> 00:46:55,670
Good. Bring him a drink.
Keep him happy.

440
00:47:06,350 --> 00:47:07,739
Why so lonely?

441
00:47:08,438 --> 00:47:10,764
- You deserted me.
- Only for a second.

442
00:47:10,978 --> 00:47:14,277
But I'm back now,
and in good company.

443
00:47:16,509 --> 00:47:20,057
- What shall we drink to?
- Your birthday?

444
00:47:20,371 --> 00:47:23,919
That's rather a reason to cry,
one year older!

445
00:47:24,338 --> 00:47:25,893
Hardly tragic at your age.

446
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:28,335
A toast for your happiness!

447
00:47:32,792 --> 00:47:34,074
Shall we dance?

448
00:47:51,406 --> 00:47:54,253
A wonderful rhythm, isn't it?

449
00:48:02,261 --> 00:48:05,323
Well, if you won't ask me...

450
00:48:05,531 --> 00:48:07,821
I was preoccupied.

451
00:48:15,864 --> 00:48:17,847
Francisco's very happy,
thanks to you.

452
00:48:18,056 --> 00:48:19,231
Why me?

453
00:48:19,413 --> 00:48:21,525
You told him the suit's
almost won.

454
00:48:21,814 --> 00:48:25,493
I couldn't have said that.
It's a difficult case.

455
00:48:25,675 --> 00:48:27,444
He's sure of victory.

456
00:48:27,624 --> 00:48:29,807
Your husband's an optimist.

457
00:48:36,982 --> 00:48:39,095
Simple to judge a person.

458
00:48:39,766 --> 00:48:42,792
Observe the way the attorney dances

459
00:48:42,967 --> 00:48:45,365
knowing she's a married woman.

460
00:48:48,533 --> 00:48:51,796
Compare him with Francisco,
a perfect gentleman.

461
00:49:09,583 --> 00:49:10,829
You might catch cold!

462
00:49:11,043 --> 00:49:13,061
I'm used to the dampness.

463
00:49:13,271 --> 00:49:16,818
I often walk out at night,
till I'm ready to drop with sleep.

464
00:49:18,281 --> 00:49:19,562
Escaping from the heat?

465
00:49:19,776 --> 00:49:23,039
And from dancing.
I'm not used to it.

466
00:49:35,328 --> 00:49:36,610
Where is the Señora?

467
00:49:36,824 --> 00:49:38,842
In the garden, with your attorney.

468
00:49:39,052 --> 00:49:41,034
- Are you sure?
- Yes, Señor.

469
00:50:38,754 --> 00:50:41,460
- Have you seen el Señor?
- He had his breakfast early.

470
00:50:41,677 --> 00:50:43,551
- Where's he?
- In his office.

471
00:50:54,533 --> 00:50:57,881
He locked himself in all day...

472
00:50:58,081 --> 00:51:00,352
then, at dinner...

473
00:52:02,147 --> 00:52:04,057
What's the matter, Francisco?

474
00:52:04,407 --> 00:52:06,246
Why are you treating me
this way?

475
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:08,478
You're so lovely tonight!

476
00:52:10,601 --> 00:52:12,511
I'll forget everything.

477
00:52:12,723 --> 00:52:16,472
Forget what?
I did nothing wrong.

478
00:52:18,672 --> 00:52:19,740
Kiss me!

479
00:52:23,851 --> 00:52:25,765
Please. Not here!

480
00:52:25,979 --> 00:52:29,349
Why not?
Do you prefer the attorney?

481
00:52:30,536 --> 00:52:33,419
Do you think I'm blind.

482
00:52:33,598 --> 00:52:34,598
What do you mean?

483
00:52:34,746 --> 00:52:37,178
You acted like a tramp!

484
00:52:37,356 --> 00:52:40,097
That's a lie! You asked me
to be nice to him...

485
00:52:40,558 --> 00:52:44,663
Did I tell you to stare at him
and dance that way with him?

486
00:52:44,837 --> 00:52:47,863
And vanish into the garden?

487
00:52:48,038 --> 00:52:49,178
Quiet!

488
00:52:49,569 --> 00:52:51,194
We're not alone.

489
00:52:52,491 --> 00:52:54,260
Pablo, don't go!

490
00:52:54,753 --> 00:52:56,735
The truth is for everyone.

491
00:53:56,195 --> 00:53:58,177
How are you, my darling?

492
00:53:59,987 --> 00:54:01,233
Why?

493
00:54:02,074 --> 00:54:03,074
What's wrong?

494
00:54:03,571 --> 00:54:05,790
I must talk to you, Mother...

495
00:54:07,189 --> 00:54:10,144
in person.
Can you come right over?

496
00:54:12,303 --> 00:54:14,522
This morning will be fine.

497
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,454
Thank you, Mother.
See you later.

498
00:54:24,929 --> 00:54:26,702
Has my mother arrived?

499
00:54:26,916 --> 00:54:29,135
Long ago. She's with the Señor.

500
00:54:29,354 --> 00:54:32,165
- Why didn't you tell me?
- La Señora didn't mention it.

501
00:54:33,457 --> 00:54:36,756
It's nothing serious, Señora.

502
00:54:36,971 --> 00:54:38,775
I agree with you.

503
00:54:39,789 --> 00:54:44,203
There you have it.
Nothing that a scolding can't cure.

504
00:54:44,521 --> 00:54:47,891
I guess I'll leave you two alone.

505
00:54:50,296 --> 00:54:54,259
Gloria, let's have a little talk.

506
00:54:57,567 --> 00:55:01,838
Francisco has told me all that's
happened since your marriage.

507
00:55:02,021 --> 00:55:04,133
- He opened his heart to me.
- And?

508
00:55:04,387 --> 00:55:07,721
You ought to be
more understanding!

509
00:55:07,935 --> 00:55:10,332
What did he tell you?

510
00:55:10,545 --> 00:55:13,642
The truth. He admitted his faults,

511
00:55:13,815 --> 00:55:15,583
but you have a few, too...

512
00:55:15,798 --> 00:55:18,895
and he understands
them perfectly.

513
00:55:19,069 --> 00:55:22,581
And the insults?
The viciousness? And this?

514
00:55:24,252 --> 00:55:28,358
Francisco is a jealous man.
Sometimes he thinks you're wrong...

515
00:55:28,914 --> 00:55:32,842
and because he loves you so much,
he tends to lose his temper.

516
00:55:33,438 --> 00:55:34,862
He deceived you, too.

517
00:55:35,351 --> 00:55:39,978
When a man talks with his heart,
he cannot lie.

518
00:55:40,674 --> 00:55:43,700
Listen to a mother's advice...

519
00:55:43,979 --> 00:55:44,979
Be good to him,

520
00:55:45,163 --> 00:55:48,260
and everything will be fine again.

521
00:55:49,477 --> 00:55:52,324
What she said shocked me...

522
00:55:52,782 --> 00:55:56,045
But who else would believe me?

523
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:59,973
I'd never felt so alone,
so desperate.

524
00:56:00,262 --> 00:56:03,145
The walls seemed
to have low ceilings.

525
00:56:03,846 --> 00:56:05,057
Finally,

526
00:56:05,237 --> 00:56:09,200
I went to the only person
who could influence him...

527
00:56:10,978 --> 00:56:12,118
Is that all?

528
00:56:13,379 --> 00:56:15,004
Isn't it enough?

529
00:56:24,512 --> 00:56:29,198
What you said, just to think
of it... should make you blush.

530
00:56:29,383 --> 00:56:33,512
I am blushing. But it's the truth.

531
00:56:33,836 --> 00:56:36,993
Truth colored
by youthful imagination...

532
00:56:40,203 --> 00:56:44,831
I've known Francisco all his life.
He holds no secrets from me.

533
00:56:45,039 --> 00:56:49,976
He's a man of faith,
a perfect example for others...

534
00:56:50,292 --> 00:56:52,582
I speak as his confessor.

535
00:56:52,797 --> 00:56:53,797
Padre, I swear that...

536
00:56:53,911 --> 00:56:55,928
I'm not finished yet!

537
00:56:56,868 --> 00:57:02,017
He never knew a woman
until you came along.

538
00:57:04,384 --> 00:57:07,683
So it's natural
if you cause him resentment...

539
00:57:07,898 --> 00:57:10,853
You don't behave badly but...

540
00:57:11,307 --> 00:57:13,111
But what have I done?

541
00:57:13,359 --> 00:57:14,914
Nothing. Yet much.

542
00:57:15,899 --> 00:57:19,755
He opened his heart
to me before you came.

543
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:21,770
For instance...

544
00:57:22,022 --> 00:57:25,463
the way you danced
the other night with the attorney.

545
00:57:26,163 --> 00:57:28,382
I mentioned it to your mother.

546
00:57:30,582 --> 00:57:32,243
Here's some advice...

547
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:33,670
Thanks, Padre,

548
00:57:34,931 --> 00:57:36,913
but I don't need any.

549
00:58:29,693 --> 00:58:31,947
So you went to see
Padre Velasco...

550
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:37,234
Well, you won't tell
our private affairs to anyone else.

551
00:58:45,112 --> 00:58:46,952
Surprised I'm alive?

552
00:58:47,547 --> 00:58:50,668
He wanted to teach me a lesson.

553
00:58:51,097 --> 00:58:54,739
It's hard to believe.
He used blank cartridges.

554
00:58:54,924 --> 00:58:57,250
How could you stand it?

555
00:58:57,602 --> 00:59:00,628
I was laid up for a week.

556
00:59:00,803 --> 00:59:04,315
My illness frightened him.
He took good care of me.

557
00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:07,786
He begged forgiveness
and seemed to repent.

558
00:59:08,214 --> 00:59:09,839
And you believed him?

559
00:59:10,058 --> 00:59:12,728
He seemed like a different man.

560
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:15,339
Things looked brighter.

561
00:59:16,077 --> 00:59:17,703
But this morning...

562
00:59:18,304 --> 00:59:19,930
That can't be, counselor.

563
00:59:20,113 --> 00:59:23,697
Pull strings.
Do anything... but win the suit!

564
00:59:24,323 --> 00:59:26,162
The documents prove it.

565
00:59:27,001 --> 00:59:28,984
They're bluffing.

566
00:59:30,968 --> 00:59:35,097
Do what you can,
and let me know.

567
00:59:37,961 --> 00:59:39,516
What happened?

568
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:44,388
Same old story: my opponents
will stop at nothing to destroy me.

569
00:59:44,607 --> 00:59:48,118
All I ever wanted
was to do the right thing,

570
00:59:48,816 --> 00:59:51,035
I'm only asking for justice.

571
00:59:56,470 --> 00:59:57,966
What is it, Gloria?

572
00:59:58,244 --> 01:00:00,498
I'm going to visit my mother.

573
01:00:01,411 --> 01:00:04,080
Don't leave me alone today.

574
01:00:05,273 --> 01:00:06,934
I need you.

575
01:00:08,299 --> 01:00:09,652
I am sad.

576
01:00:10,874 --> 01:00:14,315
You look a little pale, yourself.
Some life we lead!

577
01:00:14,493 --> 01:00:17,234
We never go anywhere.
Never do anything.

578
01:00:17,450 --> 01:00:19,740
- Let's get out for the day!
- As you wish.

579
01:00:19,954 --> 01:00:23,704
I'll be all yours, we'll have fun.
What do you feel like doing?

580
01:00:23,921 --> 01:00:26,519
- Anything.
- You name it.

581
01:00:27,226 --> 01:00:28,472
The movies?

582
01:00:28,687 --> 01:00:30,870
Not the way I feel...

583
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:37,104
- The racetrack?
- You'd like that? Hot, dusty...

584
01:00:37,315 --> 01:00:40,234
and packed with morons.

585
01:00:40,829 --> 01:00:43,428
Nothing I hate more
than happy morons.

586
01:00:46,118 --> 01:00:49,665
Wait! I know a wonderful place!

587
01:00:49,876 --> 01:00:52,688
- Where?
- Come on, you'll see.

588
01:01:04,106 --> 01:01:05,767
Isn't it marvelous?

589
01:01:06,088 --> 01:01:09,244
How can you compare it
with the movies or the track?

590
01:01:09,463 --> 01:01:12,798
It's very beautiful,
but I prefer more people...

591
01:01:13,186 --> 01:01:16,627
To each his own. I like it here...

592
01:01:17,186 --> 01:01:20,865
high, free from me worries

593
01:01:21,083 --> 01:01:23,267
of a grubby world.

594
01:01:23,449 --> 01:01:25,075
Look! Come!

595
01:01:37,957 --> 01:01:42,062
Look down there... those people:

596
01:01:42,725 --> 01:01:45,263
worms dragging...

597
01:01:45,682 --> 01:01:47,735
that I could squash
in an instant.

598
01:01:47,943 --> 01:01:50,994
You are self-centered!

599
01:01:51,222 --> 01:01:54,691
Why not?
Self is the essence of Soul...

600
01:01:55,005 --> 01:01:56,986
Their presence
fills me with loathing.

601
01:01:57,197 --> 01:01:59,630
If I were God I'd destroy them.

602
01:02:16,402 --> 01:02:18,455
Do you realize we're alone?

603
01:02:19,325 --> 01:02:22,208
That no one could stop me
from punishing you...

604
01:02:23,092 --> 01:02:25,240
What if I took you by the neck...

605
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:30,697
and I threw you
all the way down...

606
01:02:32,685 --> 01:02:36,019
by sending you hurtling down
against the sidewalk!

607
01:02:42,287 --> 01:02:45,929
Gloria, come back!
I won't hurt you. Come back!

608
01:02:57,947 --> 01:03:00,684
I ran from the tower,
disappeared in the crowd...

609
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:03,641
and walked 'til my feet gave out.

610
01:03:04,066 --> 01:03:06,321
I was returning home
when I met you.

611
01:03:07,162 --> 01:03:10,081
Stop here!
He mustn't see us together.

612
01:03:10,712 --> 01:03:14,568
It seems to me
that you enjoy suffering, Gloria.

613
01:03:14,781 --> 01:03:16,858
Why don't you leave him!

614
01:03:17,217 --> 01:03:20,136
I would... but I feel
deeply sorry for him.

615
01:03:20,453 --> 01:03:22,850
I know he loves me,
in some strange way.

616
01:03:23,027 --> 01:03:26,290
I'm also afraid of him.
Greatly afraid.

617
01:03:26,507 --> 01:03:30,090
I can imagine.
It's reason enough to leave him.

618
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:33,843
Many times I thought I would.
But there's something...

619
01:03:34,057 --> 01:03:35,552
I just can't make it out!

620
01:03:35,762 --> 01:03:38,574
The man's completely mad.

621
01:03:38,753 --> 01:03:41,422
Yet, with others
he seems so sensible...

622
01:03:42,093 --> 01:03:45,640
Heaven only knows...
what can I do?

623
01:03:45,770 --> 01:03:49,150
I think you should
talk to a psychiatrist about him...

624
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:53,293
and consult an attorney
on your rights as his wife.

625
01:03:53,574 --> 01:03:55,272
Maybe you're right.

626
01:03:56,184 --> 01:03:59,483
It's something to attempt...
when I feel up to it.

627
01:04:03,873 --> 01:04:07,029
One more thing:
if you ever need me...

628
01:04:07,247 --> 01:04:11,412
just pick up the phone
and I'll be right over.

629
01:05:00,719 --> 01:05:01,789
Come here!

630
01:05:29,118 --> 01:05:30,741
Who took you home?

631
01:05:32,316 --> 01:05:34,855
- So you saw me!
- Yes. Who was it?

632
01:05:41,919 --> 01:05:42,986
Very well.

633
01:05:43,866 --> 01:05:45,291
Perfect.

634
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:49,182
Now you can't say
I'm seeing things.

635
01:05:49,364 --> 01:05:50,717
You're confessing at last!

636
01:05:50,930 --> 01:05:52,983
Why not?

637
01:05:53,539 --> 01:05:57,253
How right I was. You trollop!

638
01:05:58,619 --> 01:06:01,574
Look, Francisco. There's a limit...

639
01:06:01,993 --> 01:06:04,046
and you went too far!

640
01:06:04,707 --> 01:06:07,804
I've taken more
than I can stand from you...

641
01:06:08,151 --> 01:06:12,671
and this is the end of the line.

642
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:16,252
- How dare you!
- Now you'll say I'm no good...

643
01:06:16,432 --> 01:06:20,846
that I'm ripe and saucy
from another man's embrace!

644
01:06:21,059 --> 01:06:24,844
Well, make of it what you will!
Only I wish it were true...

645
01:06:25,130 --> 01:06:29,686
so I could spit in your face
for all the suffering you caused me!

646
01:06:31,149 --> 01:06:33,439
How can you speak
that way to me?

647
01:06:33,654 --> 01:06:36,715
Because I'd do anything
rather than live with you...

648
01:06:36,925 --> 01:06:41,196
anything, rather than take more
of what you've given... anything!

649
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:49,339
So could I, Gloria, so would I.

650
01:07:11,020 --> 01:07:12,052
Who's that?

651
01:07:16,343 --> 01:07:17,697
Is that you, Señor?

652
01:07:21,666 --> 01:07:22,948
What happened?

653
01:07:29,564 --> 01:07:31,546
I feel miserable, Pablo...

654
01:07:32,695 --> 01:07:37,322
I need someone who can love,
understand me.

655
01:07:37,635 --> 01:07:40,554
Señor... you honor me...

656
01:07:40,767 --> 01:07:43,614
you know how I respect you.

657
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:45,912
What can I do?

658
01:07:48,978 --> 01:07:52,004
My wife... has betrayed me.
I'm sure of it.

659
01:07:52,457 --> 01:07:55,163
Yet, I love her...

660
01:07:55,553 --> 01:07:58,508
there could never be anyone else.

661
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:01,183
I'm upset.

662
01:08:03,833 --> 01:08:05,744
That's why I've come to you.

663
01:08:06,165 --> 01:08:08,704
But how can I help?

664
01:08:09,296 --> 01:08:11,135
With advice.

665
01:08:13,227 --> 01:08:16,595
What would you do in my shoes?

666
01:08:16,806 --> 01:08:18,654
Leave her. Get a divorce.

667
01:08:22,065 --> 01:08:23,133
How?

668
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:25,221
I'd get a divorce, Señor.

669
01:08:28,536 --> 01:08:31,242
Wouldn't you kill her?

670
01:08:31,910 --> 01:08:35,589
And spend the rest of my life
in jail. Decidedly not, Señor.

671
01:08:36,085 --> 01:08:40,713
Forgive my saying so, but you've
been unhappy since you married her.

672
01:08:40,921 --> 01:08:44,042
If you're sure of what happened,
get rid of her.

673
01:08:44,262 --> 01:08:47,561
The world is full of women.
You'll find someone.

674
01:08:54,769 --> 01:08:56,881
Shall I bring you some tea, Señor?

675
01:10:55,545 --> 01:10:57,859
- Would you come for a second?
- What for?

676
01:10:58,071 --> 01:10:59,981
Come... I beg you.

677
01:11:09,323 --> 01:11:10,323
What do you want?

678
01:11:10,492 --> 01:11:15,084
My head's killing me. I've got to
write a letter about my law suit...

679
01:11:15,292 --> 01:11:20,228
I'm afraid it's already lost.
Those lawyers... they deserted me.

680
01:11:20,615 --> 01:11:23,285
Come, sit by my side.

681
01:11:25,451 --> 01:11:28,821
I don't know what's wrong with me.
My head hurts...

682
01:11:29,035 --> 01:11:31,634
I can't concentrate.
Thoughts won't come...

683
01:11:31,888 --> 01:11:35,779
and I must write
to the Governor...

684
01:11:36,133 --> 01:11:38,731
But, I just can't do it!

685
01:11:39,056 --> 01:11:41,133
Then try it when you feel better.

686
01:11:41,352 --> 01:11:44,828
It must be written now.
Too much depends on it.

687
01:11:45,770 --> 01:11:48,725
I'll suffer horribly
until it's mailed.

688
01:11:49,006 --> 01:11:50,704
I'll type you out a draft.

689
01:11:50,954 --> 01:11:54,845
Wonderful! You know
the case as well as I...

690
01:11:55,025 --> 01:11:58,122
present a review
of the injustices.

691
01:11:58,504 --> 01:12:03,096
It's so simple, so clear,
but I just can't...

692
01:12:42,793 --> 01:12:43,826
Stop!

693
01:12:44,185 --> 01:12:48,077
You make do such a simple task
for me! It's humiliating.

694
01:12:48,290 --> 01:12:49,951
I'll do it, no matter what...

695
01:12:54,053 --> 01:12:57,404
Lock the door!
We can't be disturbed.

696
01:13:07,100 --> 01:13:08,325
Sit here!

697
01:13:14,871 --> 01:13:16,640
You mustn't leave my side.

698
01:13:32,998 --> 01:13:34,493
I can't do it!

699
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:38,459
Calm yourself, Francisco.

700
01:13:38,773 --> 01:13:40,648
We'll write it together.

701
01:13:41,035 --> 01:13:43,741
Everything will turn out fine.

702
01:14:01,736 --> 01:14:03,955
May I serve dinner?

703
01:14:04,624 --> 01:14:06,428
Don't bother us!

704
01:14:12,452 --> 01:14:15,407
- Leave that. Come.
- What do you want now?

705
01:14:15,618 --> 01:14:17,208
- Sit near me.
- Let me finish.

706
01:14:17,427 --> 01:14:18,495
Forget the letter!

707
01:14:25,359 --> 01:14:30,817
You can't stand me, can you?
I know I've made you very unhappy.

708
01:14:31,031 --> 01:14:32,526
You can't deny it...

709
01:14:32,770 --> 01:14:36,211
but I feel lonely and sick.
Take pity on me...

710
01:14:36,945 --> 01:14:40,944
there's only you...
and you hate me!

711
01:14:41,155 --> 01:14:42,781
I don't hate you, Francisco...

712
01:14:42,999 --> 01:14:45,740
You can't help it
and suffer more than I do.

713
01:14:45,956 --> 01:14:50,928
Don't leave me. Maybe it's not
too late to find happiness.

714
01:14:51,106 --> 01:14:55,069
Why don't you see a doctor.
You're ill, now...

715
01:14:55,802 --> 01:14:58,614
but you'll get better.
Then we could...

716
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:02,301
I'll do whatever you say,
just don't leave me.

717
01:15:02,656 --> 01:15:07,628
Forget what happened the other day!
I know you were telling the truth.

718
01:15:08,223 --> 01:15:09,848
I never lied to you.

719
01:15:11,110 --> 01:15:13,993
You were lonely, desperate...

720
01:15:14,451 --> 01:15:17,157
you had to confide in someone.

721
01:15:18,053 --> 01:15:22,130
I was terribly confused...

722
01:15:24,540 --> 01:15:25,751
Of course you were.

723
01:15:25,932 --> 01:15:29,931
Raul's a wonderful person.
He's very understanding.

724
01:15:31,604 --> 01:15:33,097
In any case...

725
01:15:33,307 --> 01:15:38,349
It must have been humiliating
confiding in an outsider.

726
01:15:40,787 --> 01:15:43,421
Very. But I had to tell someone.

727
01:15:44,335 --> 01:15:48,606
I could overlook
almost anything... but not that!

728
01:15:49,067 --> 01:15:53,066
You did wrong, Gloria,
very wrong!

729
01:18:32,236 --> 01:18:34,213
Hear that? It's the Señora!

730
01:18:35,751 --> 01:18:37,178
Let me go!

731
01:19:30,449 --> 01:19:31,621
It's me, señor.

732
01:19:35,253 --> 01:19:39,173
Sorry to disturb you so early,
but the Señora has gone.

733
01:19:44,468 --> 01:19:45,468
What time is it?

734
01:19:46,068 --> 01:19:47,244
Ten of seven.

735
01:19:48,469 --> 01:19:49,469
Go!

736
01:20:30,183 --> 01:20:32,510
Where is she?
Send her right down!

737
01:20:32,723 --> 01:20:35,678
Look for yourself!
She hasn't been here.

738
01:20:36,635 --> 01:20:39,610
- Call her mother down.
- She's left town.

739
01:20:48,380 --> 01:20:49,875
I know where she is.

740
01:21:47,446 --> 01:21:48,986
He's not in.

741
01:21:49,196 --> 01:21:53,609
I saw him leave as I was bringing
in the milk, a minute ago.

742
01:22:00,747 --> 01:22:03,345
- Did you laugh at me?
- I didn't laugh, señor.

743
01:23:36,584 --> 01:23:38,126
Start driving!

744
01:26:17,005 --> 01:26:20,128
My God, they all know it!

745
01:26:59,972 --> 01:27:02,191
Even you, Padre Velasco.

746
01:27:30,763 --> 01:27:32,781
Don't hurt him! He's my friend.

747
01:27:33,059 --> 01:27:34,234
He's gone mad!

748
01:28:35,274 --> 01:28:36,338
You'll see him...

749
01:28:36,519 --> 01:28:40,499
the picture of humility...

750
01:28:40,718 --> 01:28:43,530
and not one complaint
about him yet!

751
01:28:43,849 --> 01:28:45,273
We're glad to hear that.

752
01:28:45,449 --> 01:28:48,631
I hope we're not disrupting
your schedule...

753
01:28:48,833 --> 01:28:51,082
I had to come
to Colombia on business

754
01:28:51,259 --> 01:28:54,380
and didn't want to leave
without stopping by.

755
01:28:54,698 --> 01:28:59,294
He was so nice to us
when he left the hospital...

756
01:28:59,502 --> 01:29:03,049
So many years have gone by.

757
01:29:03,260 --> 01:29:05,479
If you like, I can take you to him.

758
01:29:06,009 --> 01:29:08,512
Why lay bare old wounds?

759
01:29:08,723 --> 01:29:11,262
- At best, it would hurt him.
- I don't think it would.

760
01:29:11,471 --> 01:29:15,256
Faith has become
his shield against the world.

761
01:29:15,472 --> 01:29:16,967
Will he join the Order?

762
01:29:17,177 --> 01:29:21,282
It's not possible.
He's better this way.

763
01:29:23,404 --> 01:29:24,994
And this young man?

764
01:29:25,785 --> 01:29:26,849
What's your name?

765
01:29:30,954 --> 01:29:31,714
Your son?

766
01:29:31,928 --> 01:29:36,757
Thanks for everything, Padre.
If we can ever be of help...

767
01:29:39,826 --> 01:29:41,700
Have a good trip.

768
01:30:00,528 --> 01:30:02,153
How do you feel?

769
01:30:02,580 --> 01:30:04,004
As you can see.

770
01:30:04,771 --> 01:30:07,061
Don't tire yourself, brother.

771
01:30:07,311 --> 01:30:12,034
Use this free time to become
better acquainted with the others.

772
01:30:12,460 --> 01:30:14,158
As you say, Padre.

773
01:30:17,889 --> 01:30:19,693
Have the visitors gone?

774
01:30:21,089 --> 01:30:22,442
What visitors?

775
01:30:23,769 --> 01:30:25,193
The engineer and...

776
01:30:27,004 --> 01:30:28,358
How did you know?

777
01:30:29,753 --> 01:30:32,150
I saw them
standing by the window.

778
01:30:32,362 --> 01:30:35,317
I also saw the child.
Is it their son?

779
01:30:35,527 --> 01:30:36,527
Yes.

780
01:30:38,103 --> 01:30:41,650
Then I wasn't as mixed up
as they claimed.

781
01:30:42,242 --> 01:30:44,983
Time has proven my point...

782
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:49,121
but to what avail?

783
01:30:50,140 --> 01:30:52,952
The real peace is here.

784
01:30:53,411 --> 01:30:56,781
Good.
Keep faith with your readings.
