2
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:37,913
Let go of me.
you damn fools!

3
00:01:38,335 --> 00:01:40,404
Damn you, let go of me!

4
00:01:40,489 --> 00:01:41,883
Let go!

5
00:01:42,854 --> 00:01:45,682
Stupid bitches!

6
00:01:45,766 --> 00:01:48,172
Let go of me, I said!

7
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,622
You're in here because
you're useless out there!

8
00:01:50,706 --> 00:01:54,042
Let go of me!
You bitches, let go!

9
00:01:55,351 --> 00:01:56,786
Let me go!

10
00:01:58,347 --> 00:02:00,670
Fifteen days locked in there
will calm her down.

11
00:02:00,755 --> 00:02:02,907
Yeah, right! She's been here
for two years...

12
00:02:02,992 --> 00:02:04,427
and is only getting worse.

13
00:02:04,512 --> 00:02:07,257
Let me go! Open up!

14
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,761
Dear Lord!
Get me out of here!

15
00:02:45,845 --> 00:02:48,294
I want to get out of here!

16
00:03:02,901 --> 00:03:05,646
Dear God, you made me
the way I am.

17
00:03:06,448 --> 00:03:09,234
Just like scorpions...
or rats.

18
00:03:10,121 --> 00:03:12,444
Lord of all jails,
have mercy on me!

19
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:15,019
Throw down the bars, the walls.

20
00:03:15,484 --> 00:03:18,016
Let me feel the air, the sun.

21
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:22,069
I have as much right as a snake,
or this spider.

22
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,065
God have mercy!

23
00:03:28,149 --> 00:03:30,049
Grant me a miracle
if you can!

24
00:03:30,133 --> 00:03:32,202
Get me out of here!
Get me out of here!

25
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:37,986
Get me out of here!

26
00:05:01,961 --> 00:05:05,043
Oh, miss! This downpour
is going to be memorable.

27
00:05:05,127 --> 00:05:06,352
Why do you say that, Felisa?

28
00:05:06,436 --> 00:05:07,872
Because it's out of season.

29
00:05:07,999 --> 00:05:10,406
And this kind of storm
is the devil's doing.

30
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:14,247
Even our sweet little cat
has just scratched me.

31
00:05:14,331 --> 00:05:17,624
Don't start, Felisa.
I know you very well.

32
00:05:17,709 --> 00:05:20,411
If the sun rises two minutes late.
It's bad luck.

33
00:05:20,497 --> 00:05:23,958
If you meet two crows head on.
It's the end of the world.

34
00:05:24,084 --> 00:05:24,971
It's superstition.

35
00:05:25,055 --> 00:05:27,884
It may be "supers"...
or whatever you may call it.

36
00:05:27,969 --> 00:05:30,206
But I was right last time.

37
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:32,274
Remember when your son
had typhus fever?

38
00:05:32,401 --> 00:05:34,301
It was after a horrible downpour.

39
00:05:34,387 --> 00:05:36,751
- Hail Mary full of grace...
- Conceived without sin.

40
00:05:36,835 --> 00:05:40,676
I can't argue with you and all your
heaven's lawyers.

41
00:05:40,761 --> 00:05:41,817
Good evening, mother.

42
00:05:41,901 --> 00:05:44,561
<i>Son, you took so long I thought
you had gone to Mexico City...</i>

43
00:05:44,645 --> 00:05:46,123
to get your agronomist degree.

44
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:47,432
Put that away.

45
00:05:47,517 --> 00:05:49,923
And my father wonders where
I get my irony from.

46
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,780
Gone all afternoon...

47
00:05:51,865 --> 00:05:54,820
I have a feeling
someone has a girlfriend.

48
00:05:54,904 --> 00:05:57,058
That's right. She's green
and she has six legs.

49
00:05:57,142 --> 00:05:58,620
- What?
- Here.

50
00:06:00,858 --> 00:06:03,264
This little bug is responsible
for ruining our com crop.

51
00:06:03,348 --> 00:06:05,713
Poor little God's creature...

52
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:07,655
You take things literally, Felisa.

53
00:06:07,739 --> 00:06:09,807
You'll never change
your childish ways.

54
00:06:09,935 --> 00:06:11,709
A 60 year-old child.

55
00:06:11,793 --> 00:06:14,242
Besides, change is no good.
Mrs. Carmen.

56
00:06:14,326 --> 00:06:16,183
No one would guess
you're over thirty.

57
00:06:16,268 --> 00:06:19,856
Thirty... Very well lived 30 years.

58
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,925
Not like today's 30 year-old.

59
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:25,472
You're impossible, Alberto.
Making Felisa talk non sense.

60
00:06:25,557 --> 00:06:26,907
Leave her alone.

61
00:06:26,992 --> 00:06:29,187
- And you, Felisa...
- He started it.

62
00:06:29,272 --> 00:06:30,918
Don't get mad. Let's make up.

63
00:06:31,002 --> 00:06:32,987
You always get your way.

64
00:06:37,548 --> 00:06:40,080
Look at you, sitting at the table
before your father.

65
00:06:40,925 --> 00:06:42,570
Sorry, mother. I forgot.

66
00:06:45,357 --> 00:06:46,666
Where is father?

67
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,494
It's alright. Stay still, stay still.

68
00:06:52,619 --> 00:06:54,350
It will be a normal delivery.
Mr. Guadalupe.

69
00:06:54,435 --> 00:06:56,166
Don't worry, be patient.

70
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,939
You know how much I love
this animal.

71
00:06:58,023 --> 00:06:59,501
I don't want her to suffer.

72
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:03,555
This love you feel for your horses
is that of a man for a woman.

73
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:05,538
- Will it take long?
- The average time.

74
00:07:05,623 --> 00:07:08,030
Go have dinner,
I'll inform you soon.

75
00:07:08,114 --> 00:07:09,591
I know you're laughing at me.

76
00:07:09,676 --> 00:07:12,251
But I feel the same way
as when my son was born.

77
00:07:12,335 --> 00:07:17,234
Jesus. as soon as it's near
go get me.

78
00:07:17,318 --> 00:07:19,006
If you fail me, I'll fire you.

79
00:07:19,091 --> 00:07:20,569
Please don't, boss.

80
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:28,209
You lose.

81
00:07:28,295 --> 00:07:29,604
It's a trick deck.

82
00:07:32,644 --> 00:07:34,079
How is the mare, father?

83
00:07:34,163 --> 00:07:37,034
The veterinary says everything
is fine, but I'm very nervous...

84
00:07:37,161 --> 00:07:39,651
As usual. as if it were your son.

85
00:07:40,834 --> 00:07:42,903
You want me to help, father?
I'm not bad at it.

86
00:07:42,987 --> 00:07:45,731
Bad at it? Sometimes I think you love
the land and the animals...

87
00:07:45,816 --> 00:07:47,378
more than you love me.

88
00:07:51,431 --> 00:07:54,048
Father, I believe I can better
prepare for my exams...

89
00:07:54,133 --> 00:07:55,696
here at the farm
than in Mexico City.

90
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:58,314
- Is that fine with you?
- Do as you wish.

91
00:07:58,398 --> 00:08:00,466
As long as you don't
get tired of us.

92
00:08:00,593 --> 00:08:02,577
I promise I'll find him a girlfriend
to distract his mind.

93
00:08:02,704 --> 00:08:05,363
Mothers have a special way
With that.

94
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:07,771
And fathers for scolding them
if they don't study.

95
00:08:07,855 --> 00:08:09,882
I promise that won't
be necessary, father.

96
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,718
Jeez, that one was close!

97
00:08:19,802 --> 00:08:22,251
Holy Mary! What a night!

98
00:08:22,337 --> 00:08:24,405
You can row your way to the barn.

99
00:08:25,629 --> 00:08:27,697
Mr. Guadalupe. please excuse me.

100
00:08:27,782 --> 00:08:29,724
What is it? Any news?

101
00:08:29,851 --> 00:08:32,806
Bad ones. The colt was stillborn.

102
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,622
Stillborn...

103
00:08:35,635 --> 00:08:37,408
Everything was going well...

104
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,971
And the mare?

105
00:08:39,055 --> 00:08:41,757
The veterinary is not sure
he can save her.

106
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:47,288
Holy Mary of God and all Saints...

107
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:52,269
My china! My china is in pieces!

108
00:08:52,354 --> 00:08:54,634
The devil seems
to be on the loose.

109
00:08:54,718 --> 00:08:56,618
Holy Trinity!

110
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,920
Look out there, in the window.

111
00:09:08,313 --> 00:09:09,917
Lord Almighty!

112
00:09:10,044 --> 00:09:11,605
Oh, dear, it's the devil!

113
00:09:11,691 --> 00:09:14,098
As the priest says:
"Stay away, Satan!"

114
00:09:14,224 --> 00:09:16,378
Will you be quiet, Felisa?

115
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:33,518
Put her on the sofa, Jesus.

116
00:09:47,324 --> 00:09:49,055
Holy Mother of God!

117
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:50,871
Stop that, Felisa!

118
00:09:50,956 --> 00:09:52,855
Bring some water and clean
towels, quickly.

119
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,924
There must have been
a bus accident.

120
00:09:55,008 --> 00:09:57,626
In a frenzy, this woman started
to run and ended up here.

121
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:59,947
- That's probably it.
- Maybe.

122
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:01,847
But now we must take care of her.

123
00:10:01,931 --> 00:10:05,268
Who knows... Yesterday we had some
gypsies around here. Maybe...

124
00:10:08,097 --> 00:10:10,756
She's hurt, but it looks like
she only fainted.

125
00:10:11,389 --> 00:10:13,415
Get me the ammonia, Jesus.
Quickly.

126
00:10:13,543 --> 00:10:14,429
Yes, madam.

127
00:10:14,514 --> 00:10:17,131
Alberto, place another cushion
under her head.

128
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:22,662
What could have happened to her?
A tragedy, no doubt.

129
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:23,928
Here you are. madam.

130
00:10:30,937 --> 00:10:33,344
Th ere. She's coming to.

131
00:10:34,188 --> 00:10:35,497
Do you feel better?

132
00:10:36,763 --> 00:10:38,199
What happened to you ?

133
00:10:41,153 --> 00:10:45,335
Well. these are women's affairs.
Leave us alone. maybe she'll calm down.

134
00:10:56,481 --> 00:10:59,773
You're very young.
Almost a child. Feeling better?

135
00:11:00,364 --> 00:11:02,095
A little, madam. Thank you.

136
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,163
Don't mention it.
What's your name?

137
00:11:04,249 --> 00:11:05,768
Susana. madam.

138
00:11:05,852 --> 00:11:08,217
- Susana what?
- Just Susana.

139
00:11:09,273 --> 00:11:11,257
Dear Lord, don't you have
a family name?

140
00:11:11,384 --> 00:11:12,819
Have you no parents?

141
00:11:13,495 --> 00:11:15,141
I never met them.

142
00:11:15,943 --> 00:11:18,814
A woman took me in and...

143
00:11:18,898 --> 00:11:20,333
We'll send you back.
Where does she live?

144
00:11:20,461 --> 00:11:23,290
- No, please, madam...
- Calm down, dear. Easy.

145
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,456
Were they cruel to you?

146
00:11:28,525 --> 00:11:31,775
The woman's husband treated
me well, but he died.

147
00:11:32,451 --> 00:11:34,268
And then it all changed.

148
00:11:34,352 --> 00:11:36,420
A dirty old man came
and wanted to...

149
00:11:37,391 --> 00:11:40,389
I refused...
Then he hit me and...

150
00:11:41,908 --> 00:11:44,314
Since I always refused he said
I was a burden.

151
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,721
That I had to work and that
he would take me to..

152
00:11:46,807 --> 00:11:48,072
Where?

153
00:11:48,664 --> 00:11:51,324
To work for a good family
in Acapulco.

154
00:11:52,928 --> 00:11:54,405
And it wasn't true.

155
00:11:55,207 --> 00:11:56,981
On the road he tried to take
advantage of me.

156
00:11:57,065 --> 00:11:58,754
Dear God, what did you do?

157
00:11:58,838 --> 00:12:02,638
I jumped out of the car,
I ran and somehow ended up here.

158
00:12:03,525 --> 00:12:05,847
Don't let him find me, madam.
Don't let him find me.

159
00:12:05,931 --> 00:12:08,000
No one will look for you here
and if he did...

160
00:12:08,085 --> 00:12:10,659
- No, madam.
- You're like a daughter to me.

161
00:12:10,787 --> 00:12:12,603
I'll protect you.

162
00:12:12,687 --> 00:12:15,980
Thank you, madam.
Thank you, mother.

163
00:12:17,077 --> 00:12:18,724
Felisa. call the men.

164
00:12:19,611 --> 00:12:23,030
You are safe now.
Calm down, girl. Calm down.

165
00:12:25,267 --> 00:12:26,746
You may come in now.

166
00:12:31,179 --> 00:12:32,572
What happened? Who is she?

167
00:12:32,656 --> 00:12:33,839
I'll tell you in a moment.

168
00:12:33,923 --> 00:12:36,119
Now, this poor girl
needs to rest.

169
00:12:36,203 --> 00:12:37,258
Do you feel better?

170
00:12:37,342 --> 00:12:39,328
Felisa, go with her.

171
00:12:39,623 --> 00:12:41,776
For the time being she can stay
at the blacksmith's room.

172
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:44,014
And give her some broth.

173
00:12:51,487 --> 00:12:52,668
Thank you, madam.

174
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:01,155
Here, here.

175
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:04,195
If it were up to me, I would
Oh well...

176
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,546
God's will be done.

177
00:13:05,631 --> 00:13:07,361
Get some sleep.
tomorrow we'll see.

178
00:13:42,023 --> 00:13:43,460
Did you find the engineer?

179
00:13:43,544 --> 00:13:46,203
With difficulty. They're all working
for the state at the moment.

180
00:13:46,288 --> 00:13:47,766
But he's on his way
to the stable.

181
00:13:47,892 --> 00:13:49,032
Thank God.

182
00:13:49,117 --> 00:13:50,804
And the poor mare?

183
00:13:50,932 --> 00:13:52,789
That's got me very worried.

184
00:13:53,126 --> 00:13:55,153
- What does Mr. Severiano say?
- Nothing really.

185
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,800
But if it goes on like this
I'll have to put her down...

186
00:13:56,885 --> 00:13:58,321
and you know how
much I love her.

187
00:13:58,405 --> 00:14:01,402
Don't be hasty.
I have a feeling she'll be fine.

188
00:14:01,487 --> 00:14:03,682
I've been hoping for a colt
from her for so long.

189
00:14:03,767 --> 00:14:05,455
But she worries me.

190
00:14:05,539 --> 00:14:09,255
But, on another note, what will
you do with the girl we took in?

191
00:14:09,847 --> 00:14:11,493
She seems so nice. so helpful.

192
00:14:11,577 --> 00:14:14,110
She's only been here for two
days and her help is noticeable.

193
00:14:14,195 --> 00:14:17,150
I pity her, she's so humble,
so innocent.

194
00:14:17,277 --> 00:14:20,316
As you wish, but we don't know
who she is or where she came from.

195
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:22,006
I feel so sorry for her.

196
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:25,004
I feel sorry for many people.
but there are places for them.

197
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:26,945
Susana!

198
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:32,180
Yes, sir.

199
00:14:33,827 --> 00:14:35,854
You seem recovered and calm.

200
00:14:35,938 --> 00:14:38,598
I think it's time to think about
what we should do with you.

201
00:14:38,682 --> 00:14:41,468
I have no one in this world. sir.

202
00:14:41,553 --> 00:14:43,918
Maybe we should take you
to a trade school...

203
00:14:44,002 --> 00:14:47,041
-or an institution were you...
- Why do you want me to leave?

204
00:14:47,168 --> 00:14:49,618
I haven't done anything and I just
want to stay here...

205
00:14:49,702 --> 00:14:50,842
where life is good.

206
00:14:50,926 --> 00:14:52,150
Let her stay, Guadalupe.

207
00:14:52,235 --> 00:14:55,486
She's gone through a lot, she wants
to work and I think she likes me.

208
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:57,976
To me you're more than the mother
I never knew, madam.

209
00:14:58,103 --> 00:15:01,059
See? Let her stay, Guadalupe.
I could use the help.

210
00:15:01,144 --> 00:15:03,170
That's up to you.
She can stay if you want.

211
00:15:03,254 --> 00:15:05,111
How can I thank you, sir?

212
00:15:05,197 --> 00:15:07,729
You have a powerful godmother.
Thank her.

213
00:15:09,164 --> 00:15:10,305
Thank you, madam.

214
00:15:10,389 --> 00:15:11,866
Go on, go do your chores.

215
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:24,870
Thank you for your help.
Mr. Guadalupe.

216
00:15:24,954 --> 00:15:26,306
You're very kind.

217
00:15:26,391 --> 00:15:27,657
And you're beautiful.

218
00:15:32,132 --> 00:15:35,003
What's the matter with you today?

219
00:15:35,087 --> 00:15:36,565
Why are you kissing me that way?

220
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:39,267
It's so hot!

221
00:15:49,189 --> 00:15:50,920
Man, look at this one.

222
00:15:51,004 --> 00:15:54,087
- What a beauty!
- I'll call the boss, you scumbag.

223
00:15:54,172 --> 00:15:55,523
Leave her alone!

224
00:15:57,422 --> 00:15:59,576
How about saying
good morning, Susana?

225
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,897
- Like decent people.
- Good morning, Jesus.

226
00:16:01,982 --> 00:16:05,191
I don't know what you did.
but the sun came out.

227
00:16:05,275 --> 00:16:07,429
Can I help you?
Just let me know.

228
00:16:07,513 --> 00:16:09,623
I don't think so.
I'm going to get some eggs.

229
00:16:09,707 --> 00:16:11,903
Unless you can help the hens.

230
00:16:13,466 --> 00:16:15,196
Those are not the hens I like.

231
00:16:15,323 --> 00:16:18,870
Really? Well, be careful with the ones
that already have roosters.

232
00:16:27,566 --> 00:16:29,382
You're very smart, blondie.

233
00:16:29,466 --> 00:16:31,831
We always tell the truth
at the ranch.

234
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:34,955
There's a lotto see
around here.

235
00:16:35,082 --> 00:16:37,193
I know the scenery well.

236
00:16:37,277 --> 00:16:38,882
And where will you take me?

237
00:16:38,966 --> 00:16:40,570
You?All the way to heaven.

238
00:16:40,655 --> 00:16:43,991
- That easy?
- No, beautiful, that hard.

239
00:16:44,075 --> 00:16:45,637
Are you afraid of me?

240
00:16:45,722 --> 00:16:47,536
Afraid? I don't even know you.

241
00:16:47,622 --> 00:16:49,986
But I'd rather have a choice.

242
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,801
And you think I don't know?

243
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:53,996
Ask the ladies.
you'll see they pick me.

244
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:56,361
And what do you tell them?

245
00:16:58,641 --> 00:17:01,807
Look, beautiful. I'm brave
and I get things done.

246
00:17:01,892 --> 00:17:03,876
Let me know when you're ready.

247
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:07,253
I'll think about it.
I don't like to make mistakes.

248
00:17:08,055 --> 00:17:11,603
Think quickly. Who knows, this
saint might go to heaven and...

249
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:14,219
May I go down, Don Juan?

250
00:17:14,347 --> 00:17:15,782
I'll get you down. Come.

251
00:17:15,908 --> 00:17:16,963
Let go of me.

252
00:17:17,048 --> 00:17:19,201
See what you've done?
All mined!

253
00:17:19,285 --> 00:17:21,312
You're so beautiful
when you're mad.

254
00:17:23,297 --> 00:17:25,703
The wind blows
and the crop blossoms.

255
00:17:25,788 --> 00:17:26,844
You want me to scream?

256
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:28,912
Don't ruin such a beautiful voice.

257
00:17:28,996 --> 00:17:30,811
What if your voice get hoarse?

258
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:34,274
There, I'll forgive you.

259
00:17:34,358 --> 00:17:35,330
You're so brave.

260
00:17:35,414 --> 00:17:36,849
Now I'll get scolded
because of you.

261
00:17:36,977 --> 00:17:40,564
Look, if you get tough, no one
will scold you but me.

262
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:42,591
I'll decide who gets
to scold me.

263
00:17:42,676 --> 00:17:44,111
See what you've done?

264
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:46,939
Now you know.

265
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:50,149
If you want to take a walk
on the farm, let me know.

266
00:17:50,233 --> 00:17:52,893
Well, pull up a chair because
you'll get tired of waiting.

267
00:18:00,703 --> 00:18:02,097
Hey, beautiful,
can I carry your basket?

268
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:03,659
How did it go with the hens?

269
00:18:03,744 --> 00:18:04,799
Jerks!

270
00:18:07,417 --> 00:18:08,810
Looks like you showed her.

271
00:18:08,894 --> 00:18:10,836
That one is tougher
than our mare.

272
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,158
I know a rancher who died
for even less.

273
00:18:13,242 --> 00:18:15,312
It was all in good fun
to see what would happen.

274
00:18:15,396 --> 00:18:17,085
Well. now you know.

275
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:18,647
- Okay.
- Let's get to work.

276
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:19,786
Yes, sir.

277
00:18:38,828 --> 00:18:40,052
Good morning, Susana.

278
00:18:40,137 --> 00:18:41,573
Good morning, Alberto.

279
00:18:42,206 --> 00:18:44,401
You're in better health
and look very pretty.

280
00:18:44,485 --> 00:18:46,934
- You're making fun of me.
- I'm being honest.

281
00:18:47,694 --> 00:18:50,564
Were you also honest
with the nice city girls?

282
00:18:50,649 --> 00:18:52,929
I'm not a pro.
I say what's in my heart.

283
00:18:53,014 --> 00:18:54,703
If only I could believe you.

284
00:18:54,787 --> 00:18:57,657
No one has ever said
anything nice to me. Ever.

285
00:18:58,418 --> 00:19:00,740
You must have lived
in a world of blind people.

286
00:19:00,824 --> 00:19:03,231
You're like the weeds
in the field.

287
00:19:03,315 --> 00:19:06,525
Nobody knows when or how they
grow until they pay attention.

288
00:19:06,609 --> 00:19:09,099
Then, you like the countryside?

289
00:19:12,055 --> 00:19:13,363
I'll tell your mother.

290
00:19:20,668 --> 00:19:22,399
You want to tell me something?

291
00:19:22,525 --> 00:19:24,721
Alberto was telling me how mu ch
he loves the farm...

292
00:19:24,805 --> 00:19:26,114
and was asking about
the clean clothes.

293
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:28,183
Felisa takes care of that.
Ask her.

294
00:19:28,309 --> 00:19:29,491
Right away, madam.

295
00:19:48,363 --> 00:19:51,192
Listen, friend. ls the Las Palmas
Hacienda far from here?

296
00:19:51,277 --> 00:19:53,978
I'm from there, sir.
Three miles away, at the most.

297
00:19:54,063 --> 00:19:55,963
Great, so you can help me.

298
00:19:56,047 --> 00:19:57,188
I will if I can.

299
00:19:57,273 --> 00:19:59,679
That's right. We're looking for a girl
that ran away...

300
00:19:59,763 --> 00:20:01,579
from the reformatory
two days ago.

301
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:04,323
We believe she's around and I need
to know if you've seen her.

302
00:20:04,407 --> 00:20:07,658
She's young, about 20 years old
and she's...

303
00:20:09,727 --> 00:20:11,374
If you know what I mean.

304
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:14,708
There are a few women there that
should be institutionalized,

305
00:20:14,836 --> 00:20:16,693
but there are no strangers.

306
00:20:16,778 --> 00:20:19,690
Here you'll find the address and phone
number of the reformatory.

307
00:20:19,817 --> 00:20:21,295
Call us if you know something.

308
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:23,406
- I'll inform the boss.
- Thank you.

309
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:25,433
Let's go.

310
00:21:13,267 --> 00:21:16,688
Maybe I should continue cleaning
later, sir. I'm in your way.

311
00:21:16,772 --> 00:21:18,545
Not at all. Go on.

312
00:21:49,238 --> 00:21:50,378
Yes, sir.

313
00:21:50,463 --> 00:21:52,489
It's best you take care of...

314
00:21:52,573 --> 00:21:54,010
Of mm at, sir?

315
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:57,219
Your clothes. I don't like
the way you dress.

316
00:21:57,303 --> 00:21:59,371
I was given these clothes here, sir.

317
00:21:59,455 --> 00:22:02,242
Do I look that bad?
It's just for work.

318
00:22:02,327 --> 00:22:03,762
Fine, that's not what I mean.

319
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,855
I know it's not pretty but...

320
00:22:10,939 --> 00:22:13,641
I'm just telling you to cover
up more.

321
00:22:13,726 --> 00:22:17,356
There are many men here.
and men are like untamed colts.

322
00:22:17,483 --> 00:22:19,426
You never know how
they'll react.

323
00:22:19,511 --> 00:22:21,072
That's my life, sir.

324
00:22:21,157 --> 00:22:23,774
When I try to do things right.
I do something wrong.

325
00:22:23,859 --> 00:22:25,294
Whatever you say.

326
00:22:25,379 --> 00:22:26,814
You didn't do anything wrong.

327
00:22:26,941 --> 00:22:30,994
It's not your fault, I just wanted
to tell you to pay more attention.

328
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,668
Go on, my wife will
explain it better.

329
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,187
Excuse me, sir.

330
00:22:53,033 --> 00:22:55,692
- With your permission, sir.
- Come in, Jesus.

331
00:23:02,574 --> 00:23:04,643
I wanted to tell you
something that...

332
00:23:07,049 --> 00:23:08,738
Well, then, go ahead.

333
00:23:08,823 --> 00:23:11,905
Don't tell me there are more
news in town?

334
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:14,691
- It's just that...
- What?

335
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:18,069
I'm listening, but you're not talking.
What is it?

336
00:23:18,913 --> 00:23:22,586
Nothing. Everyone in town
is worried about the mare.

337
00:23:22,671 --> 00:23:24,740
Since she's Arabian. you know...

338
00:23:24,824 --> 00:23:26,091
That's how they are.

339
00:23:26,175 --> 00:23:28,835
And the seeds arrive tomorrow.
That's it.

340
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:30,524
- All right.
- Excuse me.

341
00:23:30,608 --> 00:23:33,352
Listen, I wanted to tell
you something.

342
00:23:34,239 --> 00:23:37,490
<i>The guys are very pushy here
and I wouldn't like it...</i>

343
00:23:37,575 --> 00:23:40,065
if they took advantage of Susana.

344
00:23:40,699 --> 00:23:42,894
The girl seems good and innocent
and I don’t want anyone...

345
00:23:42,979 --> 00:23:44,330
messing with her.

346
00:23:44,414 --> 00:23:47,707
You know what I mean.
I'll put you in charge of that.

347
00:23:48,425 --> 00:23:50,874
All right, boss.
I'll handle that.

348
00:24:01,597 --> 00:24:04,722
Guadalupe, Mr. Severiano
is waiting for you.

349
00:24:04,806 --> 00:24:05,735
When did he arrive?

350
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,128
He's been with the mare
for a while.

351
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:09,112
He believes he can save her
and he wants to see you.

352
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:10,547
I'll be right there.

353
00:24:10,632 --> 00:24:12,194
Before I forget.

354
00:24:12,278 --> 00:24:15,023
I wanted to talk to you
about that girl, Susana.

355
00:24:15,614 --> 00:24:18,738
She's young and I don't think
she realizes she's a woman...

356
00:24:18,823 --> 00:24:21,694
and she dresses in a ﬂashy way.

357
00:24:21,821 --> 00:24:23,847
You know it's better to avoid that
out here.

358
00:24:23,974 --> 00:24:27,309
And you noticed that?
You're only interested in horses.

359
00:24:27,393 --> 00:24:31,067
We dressed her up in a hurry.
that's true.

360
00:24:31,151 --> 00:24:32,418
I'll take care of that.

361
00:24:32,502 --> 00:24:34,908
I mentioned it to her, but you
better talk to her too.

362
00:24:35,036 --> 00:24:36,724
Don't worry, I'll handle it.

363
00:24:45,295 --> 00:24:46,730
Does it fit?

364
00:24:46,857 --> 00:24:48,039
You tell me.

365
00:24:48,123 --> 00:24:51,206
How could it not.
after all I've worked on it.

366
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:52,599
Is that if for now, madam?

367
00:24:52,683 --> 00:24:54,246
Yes, I think so.

368
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:56,779
Now, could you drop these clothes
off in my son's room?

369
00:24:56,905 --> 00:24:57,961
Yes, madam.

370
00:25:04,673 --> 00:25:09,022
Oh, dear. That one won't even
look decent in a nun's habit.

371
00:25:09,149 --> 00:25:11,724
Felisa. you're so negative.

372
00:25:11,808 --> 00:25:14,553
I'll be quiet, but I know
what I'm saying.

373
00:25:14,637 --> 00:25:16,790
She never did anything to you.

374
00:25:16,874 --> 00:25:18,437
You don't like her and that's not
a Christian attitude.

375
00:25:18,521 --> 00:25:21,393
She's not Christian
Just look at her.

376
00:25:21,477 --> 00:25:23,208
Don't say that, Felisa.

377
00:25:23,292 --> 00:25:25,108
She's humble and obedient.

378
00:25:25,192 --> 00:25:28,274
The quiet ones are the worst.

379
00:25:29,034 --> 00:25:31,905
Do good unto others
as the priest says.

380
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:36,846
Yes, but doing good
is keeping your eye on her.

381
00:25:38,365 --> 00:25:40,771
Oh, well. We'll see what happens.

382
00:25:56,435 --> 00:25:57,786
Come in!

383
00:26:03,191 --> 00:26:06,187
Excuse-me, sir. Mrs. Carmen told me
to bring you these clothes.

384
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:08,847
Thank you. Please leave it
on the table.

385
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:16,743
So many books, and you even
have them on the ﬂoor.

386
00:26:16,827 --> 00:26:18,136
I'm putting them in order.

387
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,993
You want me to help you?

388
00:26:20,077 --> 00:26:21,682
No, Susana, thank you.

389
00:26:21,766 --> 00:26:23,582
Women don't understand
these things.

390
00:26:24,131 --> 00:26:25,905
Forgive me. sir. Excuse-me.

391
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:37,304
Forgive me, I didn't mean
to offend you.

392
00:26:37,431 --> 00:26:40,133
If you want to help, we can start
with these big books.

393
00:26:40,217 --> 00:26:41,737
Are you mad at me?

394
00:26:41,821 --> 00:26:43,341
What nonsense.
Why would I be mad?

395
00:26:43,468 --> 00:26:44,903
You're treating me formally.

396
00:26:45,029 --> 00:26:47,435
If that's all, can you hand
me these books?

397
00:26:47,563 --> 00:26:48,786
Yes, Mr. Alberto.

398
00:26:55,542 --> 00:26:57,316
Are you going to read
all these books?

399
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,625
I already have.

400
00:26:58,751 --> 00:27:01,241
You must know many
beautiful things.

401
00:27:02,086 --> 00:27:04,114
But why keep them if you've
already read them?

402
00:27:04,198 --> 00:27:06,224
Books are kept
out of fondness.

403
00:27:06,308 --> 00:27:08,039
Like a woman you love.

404
00:27:09,855 --> 00:27:11,460
It's very different.

405
00:27:12,515 --> 00:27:14,879
Hand me the blue book.
The one with the ribbon.

406
00:27:15,766 --> 00:27:17,708
This one?
What is it about?

407
00:27:19,355 --> 00:27:21,170
- Goodness!
- What is it?

408
00:27:21,254 --> 00:27:22,436
A naked man.

409
00:27:23,787 --> 00:27:26,151
Look, this is a book
about mythology.

410
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:28,812
This is Apollo, he represents
man's beauty.

411
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:31,682
I didn't know you could say
a man was beautiful.

412
00:27:31,768 --> 00:27:33,878
- Are you teasing me?
- NO. seriously.

413
00:27:33,962 --> 00:27:37,128
It's a symbol of beauty.
Just as your name is a symbol.

414
00:27:37,213 --> 00:27:39,155
- Really?
- May I tell you of what?

415
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,970
- Of what?
- Of chastity.

416
00:27:51,314 --> 00:27:52,539
Are you hurt?

417
00:27:52,623 --> 00:27:54,735
No, and you?

418
00:28:20,236 --> 00:28:22,136
Alberto, are you in there?

419
00:28:22,853 --> 00:28:24,119
Yes, moth er.

420
00:28:27,834 --> 00:28:28,890
Do you need something?

421
00:28:29,017 --> 00:28:31,297
No, nothing.
I was just passing by.

422
00:28:31,381 --> 00:28:33,704
By the way, did Susana bring
you your shirts?

423
00:28:33,788 --> 00:28:35,097
Yes, a while ago.

424
00:28:35,181 --> 00:28:37,165
What's wrong?
You seem odd.

425
00:28:37,249 --> 00:28:39,656
Nothing. I was organizing
my books.

426
00:28:39,741 --> 00:28:42,315
I'll let you continue.

427
00:28:48,861 --> 00:28:51,267
- Please, I have to go.
- Don't go.

428
00:28:51,393 --> 00:28:52,744
- Please.
- Wail.

429
00:29:06,634 --> 00:29:09,336
Susana, I need to talk to you.

430
00:29:40,157 --> 00:29:42,226
Well. here we are.

431
00:29:42,944 --> 00:29:46,110
- What's this secret of yours?
- You don't know, blondie?

432
00:29:46,236 --> 00:29:48,305
How should I?
What do you want?

433
00:29:49,107 --> 00:29:51,050
I want you. I like you.

434
00:29:51,135 --> 00:29:53,329
But I don't like you
and you need two people for that.

435
00:29:53,457 --> 00:29:55,737
Aren't we two?
Don't be surly.

436
00:29:55,821 --> 00:29:59,536
Ever since I saw you, I knew
I'd be able to tame you.

437
00:30:00,253 --> 00:30:02,829
I'll make you very. very calm.

438
00:30:03,505 --> 00:30:04,687
Easy.

439
00:30:05,362 --> 00:30:07,263
You're the kind that
talks to himself.

440
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:09,162
Don't you think I have
something to say?

441
00:30:09,247 --> 00:30:12,581
Words are not necessary.
My word is enough.

442
00:30:12,666 --> 00:30:14,651
You're that sure of yourself?

443
00:30:14,735 --> 00:30:17,395
I'm sure of what I want,
that's what matters.

444
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:20,688
And that's what your eyes say
when you're silent.

445
00:30:21,744 --> 00:30:23,137
Let go of me!
Let go!

446
00:30:25,121 --> 00:30:26,472
Tell me you like me.

447
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,203
Maybe not.

448
00:30:28,287 --> 00:30:29,850
And maybe yes.

449
00:30:29,935 --> 00:30:31,919
I have to give that some thought.

450
00:30:32,045 --> 00:30:34,156
Suppose I don't want to wait.

451
00:30:34,241 --> 00:30:35,338
It's up to you.

452
00:30:35,465 --> 00:30:37,533
Don't be a prude.
Kiss me.

453
00:30:38,293 --> 00:30:39,138
Just one.

454
00:30:39,222 --> 00:30:40,404
Let me go, Jesus.

455
00:30:42,854 --> 00:30:46,273
It's okay, beautiful.
You're afraid of me.

456
00:30:47,878 --> 00:30:49,355
But I'll take care of you.

457
00:30:49,862 --> 00:30:51,255
Me? Afraid?

458
00:30:51,339 --> 00:30:52,394
Of what?

459
00:30:53,365 --> 00:30:54,887
You don't know?

460
00:30:54,971 --> 00:30:58,432
Look at these arms. They are strong
and want to hold you.

461
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:00,797
It's better to be a prisoner
of loving arms.

462
00:31:00,923 --> 00:31:03,161
Than you know where.

463
00:31:05,229 --> 00:31:06,580
What do you say?

464
00:31:07,932 --> 00:31:11,901
Well, then...
I'll be honest with you.

465
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,700
I'm surly, but you know
I like you.

466
00:31:15,784 --> 00:31:17,516
You said it yourself.

467
00:31:18,148 --> 00:31:21,020
But we have to make sure
no one finds out.

468
00:31:21,105 --> 00:31:23,934
Leave me for now. We'll find a safe
place and tomorrow...

469
00:31:24,018 --> 00:31:27,268
Tomorrow is never
and later is too late.

470
00:31:36,346 --> 00:31:38,330
No, Jesus. This is crazy.

471
00:31:48,632 --> 00:31:50,067
Alberto, son.

472
00:31:51,587 --> 00:31:53,149
Find Jesus for me, please.

473
00:31:53,233 --> 00:31:54,964
Mr. Severiano prescribed this
for the mare...

474
00:31:55,049 --> 00:31:56,526
and he has to go get it
right away.

475
00:31:56,653 --> 00:31:59,693
And tell him to get the vet on his
way back to give the shot.

476
00:32:54,579 --> 00:32:55,845
What is it?

477
00:32:57,239 --> 00:32:58,674
What are you doing here, Susana?

478
00:32:58,758 --> 00:33:01,967
Don't get mad. I was passing by
and when I saw you with the bugs...

479
00:33:02,051 --> 00:33:04,079
I figured you're a scholar.

480
00:33:04,163 --> 00:33:05,683
And since all scholars are old...

481
00:33:05,809 --> 00:33:06,991
So what?

482
00:33:07,076 --> 00:33:08,975
I don't want you to look old.

483
00:33:09,103 --> 00:33:11,213
That means you like me a little.

484
00:33:11,339 --> 00:33:13,451
A little? No, sir.

485
00:33:14,548 --> 00:33:15,899
Forgive me if I don't
believe you.

486
00:33:15,984 --> 00:33:17,293
Are you mad again?

487
00:33:17,378 --> 00:33:19,024
It must be
from studying too much.

488
00:33:19,108 --> 00:33:21,135
That's why you look like
and old man.

489
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:23,203
You must have something
to do, right?

490
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:26,750
I don't, besides, I'd love to be
here with you for a moment.

491
00:33:26,834 --> 00:33:28,945
I'm done with all my house chores.

492
00:33:30,382 --> 00:33:31,775
And your barn chores?

493
00:33:31,859 --> 00:33:33,885
I don't understand.
What do you mean?

494
00:33:33,969 --> 00:33:35,574
Maybe Jesus is better than me.

495
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,980
Why should I care about Jesus?

496
00:33:38,064 --> 00:33:40,851
That's your business, but I saw
you two going into the barn.

497
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:42,625
Yesterday you mean?

498
00:33:42,709 --> 00:33:44,652
He wanted to show me
where the com was.

499
00:33:44,778 --> 00:33:46,720
And for that you had
to close the door?

500
00:33:46,804 --> 00:33:50,309
I didn't close it. I gathered the corn
and left out the orchard door.

501
00:33:50,393 --> 00:33:51,870
Maybe he closed it.

502
00:33:51,955 --> 00:33:53,686
Then, he's after you.

503
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:55,334
I swear I haven't noticed.

504
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,275
And what do I care
what he does?

505
00:33:57,359 --> 00:33:59,681
I wish I could believe you.
but I can't.

506
00:34:35,358 --> 00:34:36,539
Here I am.

507
00:34:36,624 --> 00:34:38,101
Why did you do that?

508
00:34:38,186 --> 00:34:39,790
To make you tum around.

509
00:34:39,874 --> 00:34:41,015
I should spank you.

510
00:34:41,099 --> 00:34:43,125
You scared me, I thought
you had fallen in.

511
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:44,856
And would you have been sad?

512
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,799
No, I would have been happy.

513
00:34:47,391 --> 00:34:48,742
- Really?
- Yes.

514
00:34:48,826 --> 00:34:50,219
Swear it.

515
00:35:22,939 --> 00:35:24,500
There is someone up there.

516
00:35:24,585 --> 00:35:25,810
I don't care.

517
00:35:25,894 --> 00:35:27,077
Let me go see who it is.

518
00:35:27,161 --> 00:35:28,132
No, wait.

519
00:35:28,216 --> 00:35:29,905
Let me go check.

520
00:37:22,842 --> 00:37:24,279
Help me!

521
00:37:26,643 --> 00:37:28,036
Help me!

522
00:37:31,581 --> 00:37:32,890
What's the matter, girl?

523
00:37:32,974 --> 00:37:34,031
My leg.

524
00:37:34,157 --> 00:37:35,383
Did I shoot you?

525
00:37:35,467 --> 00:37:36,944
No, I fell from up there.

526
00:37:37,071 --> 00:37:39,773
I thought I had shot you.
What are you doing here?

527
00:37:39,857 --> 00:37:42,517
- Didn't you hear the shots?
- That's why I ran, sir.

528
00:37:42,601 --> 00:37:45,134
- Where does it hurt?
- Here.

529
00:37:49,821 --> 00:37:51,805
- Here?
- Not there.

530
00:37:55,352 --> 00:37:56,280
Can you walk?

531
00:37:56,407 --> 00:37:57,800
I don't know, sir.
It hurts a lot.

532
00:37:57,884 --> 00:37:59,742
Let's see. Hold on.

533
00:38:04,092 --> 00:38:05,485
Slowly, slowly.

534
00:38:10,128 --> 00:38:12,028
- Come on.
- It hurts.

535
00:38:14,605 --> 00:38:15,828
My handkerchief.

536
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:17,349
Wait here.

537
00:38:23,512 --> 00:38:24,483
Let's go.

538
00:38:39,218 --> 00:38:40,358
I am fine. sir.

539
00:38:41,372 --> 00:38:43,694
<i>Carmen . where are you?</i>

540
00:38:46,648 --> 00:38:47,789
What's the matter?

541
00:38:48,718 --> 00:38:49,815
What happened?

542
00:38:49,899 --> 00:38:52,264
This scatterbrain fell down a cliff
and hurt her knee.

543
00:38:52,348 --> 00:38:53,785
It's nothing, really.

544
00:38:53,869 --> 00:38:56,950
We should take care of that,
it can lead to worse things.

545
00:38:57,035 --> 00:38:58,090
Come with me.

546
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:01,215
Help me carry this girl.

547
00:39:01,299 --> 00:39:02,438
I'm okay, madam.

548
00:39:02,566 --> 00:39:04,085
We'll take care of you.

549
00:39:04,169 --> 00:39:06,872
You'll stay in bed all day
and tomorrow we'll see.

550
00:39:07,589 --> 00:39:08,646
Come on.

551
00:41:08,886 --> 00:41:10,702
- What do you want?
- To come in.

552
00:41:10,786 --> 00:41:12,179
Not here.
We might be seen.

553
00:41:12,813 --> 00:41:14,840
Mr. Alberto is asleep.

554
00:41:14,924 --> 00:41:16,317
I'm not referring to him.
but to anyone.

555
00:41:16,403 --> 00:41:17,710
I'm referring to him.

556
00:41:17,796 --> 00:41:19,231
This morning I saw you
together at the well.

557
00:41:19,315 --> 00:41:22,355
Then you know I'm free
to do as l wish.

558
00:41:22,482 --> 00:41:25,732
No, baby. Not with me.
Mark my word.

559
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:27,464
I'm so scared.
Don't be silly.

560
00:41:27,549 --> 00:41:30,293
I'm not one of those, Susana.
Watch out.

561
00:41:31,812 --> 00:41:33,332
I like it when you laugh.

562
00:41:41,481 --> 00:41:42,874
Pure breed bitch.

563
00:41:44,816 --> 00:41:45,914
Listen to what I say.

564
00:41:45,998 --> 00:41:47,729
You'll be mine.
no one else's.

565
00:41:47,813 --> 00:41:50,600
Tomorrow evening I'll wait for you
at the Carmelita ruins.

566
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:54,780
If you don't go, I'll tell the boss
who you are and where you came from.

567
00:42:04,574 --> 00:42:06,897
You haven't gone to bed yet?

568
00:42:08,712 --> 00:42:10,148
Are you feeling ill?

569
00:42:10,232 --> 00:42:13,610
- I'm fine, mother.
- You're burning up.

570
00:42:13,694 --> 00:42:15,552
I'm telling you, it's nothing.

571
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,803
I just want to be alone.
that's all.

572
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,096
- In the dark, son?
- Yes, in the dark.

573
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:25,051
I'm not afraid of the boogeyman
and I don't need to ask permission.

574
00:42:25,136 --> 00:42:27,373
I'm not a child, you don't need
to watch over me.

575
00:42:28,724 --> 00:42:32,060
Dear Lord. How can you talk
to your mother like that?

576
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:36,831
You have always been so kind.
I can't believe it.

577
00:42:38,182 --> 00:42:39,490
I can't believe it.

578
00:42:46,795 --> 00:42:49,412
I'm just a bit nervous, that's all.

579
00:42:49,496 --> 00:42:53,000
I didn't mean to upset you.
I swear. Forgive me.

580
00:42:53,845 --> 00:42:57,729
Poor child. You study so much sometimes
I wish you knew nothing.

581
00:42:58,996 --> 00:43:01,909
You work too hard, as if your life
depended on it.

582
00:43:04,991 --> 00:43:07,735
All right, go to sleep.

583
00:43:07,819 --> 00:43:09,508
Rest, my boy.

584
00:43:11,071 --> 00:43:12,928
Yes, mother. See you tomorrow.

585
00:43:13,773 --> 00:43:15,124
See you tomorrow, son.

586
00:43:43,622 --> 00:43:47,295
I'm worried about Alberto.
He's been irritable and nervous lately.

587
00:43:47,379 --> 00:43:49,111
Today he was in his room
in the dark and...

588
00:43:49,196 --> 00:43:51,856
And you asked what was wrong
and he was rude, right?

589
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:55,527
No, he's never rude, but I think
he studies too hard...

590
00:43:55,613 --> 00:43:57,174
and he's at a very
impressionable age.

591
00:43:57,259 --> 00:44:00,931
If he was rude it's your own fault
You are always on top of him...

592
00:44:01,016 --> 00:44:03,296
- How can you say that?
- Leave him alone!

593
00:44:03,381 --> 00:44:05,746
He's not a colt anymore.
he can run on his own.

594
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:07,349
Besides, he's of good breeding.

595
00:44:07,434 --> 00:44:09,587
Men are always protecting
each other.

596
00:44:09,671 --> 00:44:12,584
But you don't know how lonely
a mother can feel when...

597
00:44:13,218 --> 00:44:15,498
If only we had a daughter...

598
00:44:16,258 --> 00:44:17,651
What's this handkerchief
doing here?

599
00:44:17,736 --> 00:44:19,087
What handkerchief?

600
00:44:19,171 --> 00:44:20,437
What do I know?

601
00:44:20,522 --> 00:44:22,506
It's the one I gave
Susana yesterday.

602
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:24,702
How did it end up in here?
Did you bring it?

603
00:44:24,786 --> 00:44:28,418
Me? Why me? Are you going
to treat me like Alberto now...

604
00:44:28,502 --> 00:44:30,021
with those annoying questions?

605
00:44:30,106 --> 00:44:31,330
Why are you acting this way?

606
00:44:31,415 --> 00:44:33,272
Your accusations have me fed up.

607
00:44:33,356 --> 00:44:35,468
"What's this handkerchief doing here?
Did you bring it?"

608
00:44:35,552 --> 00:44:37,621
I don't need this at my age.

609
00:44:37,705 --> 00:44:41,505
I didn't do anything to make you
think I'm accusing you.

610
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:45,094
Sure, as a typical woman you ask
innocent loaded questions...

611
00:44:45,178 --> 00:44:47,332
and then you say it was nothing.

612
00:44:48,176 --> 00:44:49,358
Women!

613
00:44:49,991 --> 00:44:51,257
Men!

614
00:45:07,344 --> 00:45:09,750
Good afternoon, boss.
You need more lambs?

615
00:45:09,877 --> 00:45:11,607
No, these are enough.

616
00:45:11,693 --> 00:45:14,563
We should try with just a few
before vaccinating the whole herd.

617
00:45:14,647 --> 00:45:16,716
Beg your pardon, boss.
What is that?

618
00:45:16,801 --> 00:45:21,488
Vitamins, they make animals
and people stronger.

619
00:45:22,797 --> 00:45:25,751
<i>That's amazing. I wish
they had a vita...</i>

620
00:45:25,836 --> 00:45:27,863
One of those for bad mood.

621
00:45:27,947 --> 00:45:29,804
Not for me, for my old lady.

622
00:45:29,889 --> 00:45:32,043
Science would really
be wonderful then.

623
00:45:33,309 --> 00:45:35,842
All right, boss.
If you'll excuse me.

624
00:45:35,969 --> 00:45:37,024
Go ahead.

625
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:02,103
- Good morning, boss.
- Good morning.

626
00:46:02,187 --> 00:46:03,284
This is from Mr. Severiano.

627
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:04,763
Just a moment, Jesus.

628
00:46:04,847 --> 00:46:06,662
Or is someone waiting for you?

629
00:46:06,747 --> 00:46:09,701
My duties, as usual.
May I help you?

630
00:46:09,829 --> 00:46:12,742
I was just wondering what
duties you're referring to.

631
00:46:12,827 --> 00:46:15,613
Professional or personal ones.

632
00:46:15,697 --> 00:46:18,863
I don't know what you mean.
but work comes first.

633
00:46:18,948 --> 00:46:20,214
Are you sure?

634
00:46:20,299 --> 00:46:21,734
I am.

635
00:46:21,818 --> 00:46:22,748
You are not?

636
00:46:22,874 --> 00:46:24,184
I have my doubts.

637
00:46:24,268 --> 00:46:26,970
Listen, youngster.
let's grab this bull by the horns.

638
00:46:27,055 --> 00:46:30,263
Have I done anything or are
you not happy about something?

639
00:46:30,347 --> 00:46:33,387
The bull you grab by the horns.
and how do you grab the cows?

640
00:46:33,472 --> 00:46:36,046
- By surprise or treason?
- Wait a moment.

641
00:46:36,174 --> 00:46:39,467
I am very fond of your family.
and they've helped me a lot...

642
00:46:39,552 --> 00:46:42,887
but I won't let you insult me
or question my manhood.

643
00:46:43,013 --> 00:46:45,420
I won't let you question
my manhood either.

644
00:46:45,504 --> 00:46:48,248
But my father gives you orders
and pays you to follow them.

645
00:46:49,008 --> 00:46:52,259
You better do it or you might get
your other hand hurt.

646
00:46:52,597 --> 00:46:53,780
Alberto...

647
00:47:32,157 --> 00:47:33,677
I had a hunch you'd come.

648
00:47:33,761 --> 00:47:36,547
Really? But you probably
don't know why I came.

649
00:47:36,633 --> 00:47:39,039
To tell you I'm not ready
to do as you please.

650
00:47:39,123 --> 00:47:41,488
Really? You're brave.

651
00:47:41,572 --> 00:47:44,148
You probably don't talk like that
to the boss's son.

652
00:47:44,274 --> 00:47:47,145
Watch out, Susana.
You can't mess with me.

653
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:49,382
You got what you wanted
the other day, didn't you?

654
00:47:49,467 --> 00:47:52,211
You think you'll get anything else?
Leave me alone!

655
00:47:52,296 --> 00:47:53,943
I'm not as weak as you think.

656
00:47:54,027 --> 00:47:56,434
That's why I like you more
and more.

657
00:47:56,518 --> 00:47:59,600
I can't sleep thinking about you,
I can't work or do anything.

658
00:47:59,685 --> 00:48:01,373
But if you don't make it up to me...

659
00:48:01,457 --> 00:48:03,948
What? You'll tell the boss
all you know about me?

660
00:48:04,033 --> 00:48:06,778
Sure, tell him. And tell him why
you kept it a secret.

661
00:48:06,862 --> 00:48:08,762
They'll get rid of both of us
and you'll never see me again.

662
00:48:08,846 --> 00:48:10,409
No, not that.

663
00:48:12,435 --> 00:48:16,192
I need you near me.
to breath your scent. see you...

664
00:48:16,277 --> 00:48:17,458
Let go of me!

665
00:48:18,219 --> 00:48:20,752
Remember this is my only home.
If I lose this...

666
00:48:20,836 --> 00:48:22,737
Come with me.
Come with me, girl.

667
00:48:22,821 --> 00:48:25,902
You're insane. I don't belong to any
man nor to his desires.

668
00:48:25,988 --> 00:48:28,646
If you behave, we can find a way.
If you don't...

669
00:48:29,997 --> 00:48:32,996
You got me, you little devil.
I'll do anything you say.

670
00:48:33,081 --> 00:48:34,684
But let me kiss you, please.

671
00:48:35,276 --> 00:48:36,880
- Not now.
- Right now.

672
00:48:36,964 --> 00:48:38,485
Don't tell me you're afraid
of getting caught.

673
00:48:38,569 --> 00:48:41,059
Afraid? I just don't want to.
Let go!

674
00:48:44,858 --> 00:48:45,916
Let me go!

675
00:48:50,517 --> 00:48:51,614
Let go!

676
00:48:53,726 --> 00:48:55,414
- Let go!
- What's going on?

677
00:48:57,103 --> 00:48:59,045
That's how you obey my orders?

678
00:48:59,130 --> 00:49:01,241
That's how you repay me
for the help and trust...

679
00:49:01,325 --> 00:49:02,296
I've placed on you for so long?

680
00:49:02,423 --> 00:49:03,394
- Boss, I...
- Be quiet!

681
00:49:03,479 --> 00:49:04,745
And get out of here.

682
00:49:04,830 --> 00:49:08,038
When I return to the farm
you better be gone or you'll regret it.

683
00:49:08,122 --> 00:49:09,768
Did you hear? Go on!

684
00:49:29,275 --> 00:49:32,314
I didn't want this to happen.
but it's not my fault.

685
00:49:32,398 --> 00:49:35,100
Please. believe me.
I better leave.

686
00:49:35,818 --> 00:49:37,845
Don't cry, girl. Get up.

687
00:49:37,973 --> 00:49:39,408
You're not leaving.

688
00:49:39,492 --> 00:49:42,236
I don't know what to do, sir.
It's always the same with me.

689
00:49:42,869 --> 00:49:44,727
I don't even look at them.

690
00:49:44,811 --> 00:49:47,640
I want to live in peace and be happy
as I was before this...

691
00:49:47,724 --> 00:49:48,948
Don't mention him.

692
00:49:49,033 --> 00:49:54,100
You'll stay here and I'll make sure
no one bothers you again.

693
00:49:54,185 --> 00:49:57,688
I'll do anything you want,
I'll work nonstop.

694
00:49:57,772 --> 00:50:00,179
<i>I'll hide in a com er where
no one will see me...</i>

695
00:50:00,264 --> 00:50:01,995
so I can live near...

696
00:50:02,967 --> 00:50:04,612
Near a man as good as you.

697
00:50:06,175 --> 00:50:07,905
It's all right, Susana.

698
00:50:07,990 --> 00:50:11,536
You've never felt protected
until this moment, right?

699
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:14,998
- I promise I'll protect you.
- You're so good, sir.

700
00:50:15,082 --> 00:50:16,012
Stand up.

701
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:17,659
You're the only man that has
ever spoken to me like that.

702
00:50:17,743 --> 00:50:21,205
Go do your chores, tonight
I'll be back from town.

703
00:50:21,332 --> 00:50:23,611
I'll ask my wife to give you
a safer job...

704
00:50:23,696 --> 00:50:25,976
so you're not exposed
to these perils.

705
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:27,241
Go on now.

706
00:50:56,881 --> 00:50:59,498
Why are you working so hard
and so quietly, Felisa?

707
00:50:59,582 --> 00:51:02,200
Hard as usual and quietly
by force...

708
00:51:02,284 --> 00:51:04,142
not to cause you a headache.

709
00:51:04,226 --> 00:51:05,999
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing.

710
00:51:06,084 --> 00:51:08,914
But this house is always
full of news.

711
00:51:08,998 --> 00:51:12,587
When it's not the sick mare.
It's the devil coming to stay...

712
00:51:12,671 --> 00:51:14,570
or Jesus leaving the hacienda.

713
00:51:14,655 --> 00:51:17,483
Heavens. I've said it!

714
00:51:17,567 --> 00:51:20,102
Jesus is leaving?
That's not possible? Why?

715
00:51:20,777 --> 00:51:24,155
He's in the courtyard
with all his things.

716
00:51:24,239 --> 00:51:26,435
Without even saying goodbye?
That's not right.

717
00:51:26,519 --> 00:51:29,179
- What happened?
- Ask Susana.

718
00:51:35,005 --> 00:51:36,230
Come here.

719
00:51:44,378 --> 00:51:46,236
Is it true you're leaving?

720
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:47,882
Not by my own Wee will.

721
00:51:48,008 --> 00:51:50,710
Mr. Guadalupe doesn't want me
to stay here.

722
00:51:51,809 --> 00:51:54,215
He probably scolded you
for something stupid.

723
00:51:54,299 --> 00:51:58,140
You know him. Tell me what
happened and I'll fix it.

724
00:51:58,268 --> 00:51:59,872
You better ask him.

725
00:51:59,999 --> 00:52:03,249
I get a knot in my throat just thinking
of leaving this place.

726
00:52:03,335 --> 00:52:06,754
You've been so good to me.
Goodbye, madam.

727
00:52:06,838 --> 00:52:08,780
And thank you for your kindness.

728
00:52:23,050 --> 00:52:25,965
Didn't I tell you? I slaved making
his favorite dish...

729
00:52:26,091 --> 00:52:27,991
and he won't even touch it.

730
00:52:28,075 --> 00:52:30,228
It's time, Alberto.
What's the matter?

731
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:34,196
Eating so little and studying so much
his brain will turn to mush.

732
00:52:34,281 --> 00:52:36,434
What the hell! I Said it.

733
00:52:36,518 --> 00:52:39,263
You're responsible
for spoiling him so much.

734
00:52:39,348 --> 00:52:41,248
If he was my son...

735
00:52:43,316 --> 00:52:46,018
Not even Felisa's rants
make you laugh.

736
00:52:46,102 --> 00:52:48,636
Something is wrong
and I don't like that.

737
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:51,761
You will eat for me and tell me
about it as you eat.

738
00:52:51,845 --> 00:52:53,196
I will sit right beside you.

739
00:52:53,281 --> 00:52:55,096
I'm not hungry, mother.
that's all.

740
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:57,966
It's about time you and I
had a good chat.

741
00:52:58,051 --> 00:53:01,977
I suffer seeing you like this.
so talk to me if you love me.

742
00:53:02,061 --> 00:53:04,173
I have nothing to say, I'm fine.

743
00:53:04,258 --> 00:53:08,816
You used to confide in me.
You'd tell me everything.

744
00:53:09,535 --> 00:53:13,250
Who can understand you better
than I? Come on, son.

745
00:53:13,334 --> 00:53:16,966
It's nothing. Just a headache I've had
since last night.

746
00:53:18,021 --> 00:53:19,372
In that case I'll get you
an aspirin.

747
00:53:19,457 --> 00:53:21,694
Wait, mother.
I already took an aspirin.

748
00:53:21,821 --> 00:53:23,002
I better lay down.

749
00:53:23,889 --> 00:53:26,845
There's nothing like rest
to cure a headache.

750
00:53:26,929 --> 00:53:30,729
And nothing like opening up
to cure other things.

751
00:53:31,447 --> 00:53:32,671
Good night, son.

752
00:54:14,469 --> 00:54:16,706
It's me, Susana,Alberto.
Open up.

753
00:54:21,224 --> 00:54:22,575
Don't come in.

754
00:55:18,136 --> 00:55:20,246
- Here are your things.
- Finally.

755
00:55:20,331 --> 00:55:23,286
I was getting worried about you.
Did something happen?

756
00:55:23,413 --> 00:55:26,496
What could have happened?
I was just busy.

757
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:29,535
I was in town, I checked the ravine
stables, and did other things.

758
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:30,675
And Alberto?

759
00:55:30,759 --> 00:55:33,672
He had a headache and that
gets him into a terrible mood.

760
00:55:33,757 --> 00:55:34,939
He went to bed early.

761
00:55:36,628 --> 00:55:40,935
I know you're never unfair.
but why did you fire Jesus?

762
00:55:42,876 --> 00:55:44,903
If you kn ow that, you know why.

763
00:55:44,988 --> 00:55:47,267
You must have asked him.

764
00:55:47,352 --> 00:55:49,673
He left without saying.
He said you...

765
00:55:49,758 --> 00:55:52,925
- That I what?
- That you'd explain it better.

766
00:55:54,318 --> 00:55:57,316
So, again, I have to justify
my actions.

767
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:59,680
Fine, that's enough.
I'll explain.

768
00:56:00,439 --> 00:56:03,648
I wanted to set an example
so no one will disobey me.

769
00:56:03,733 --> 00:56:06,309
Jesus disobeyed you?
That's strange.

770
00:56:06,393 --> 00:56:09,771
He's so willing. Always so...
What did he do?

771
00:56:09,855 --> 00:56:12,936
What difference does it make?
It's all the same.

772
00:56:13,654 --> 00:56:16,018
Don't get mad.
I just wanted to know.

773
00:56:16,103 --> 00:56:17,412
Yes, sure.

774
00:56:17,961 --> 00:56:20,410
There must be an explanation.
a reason...

775
00:56:20,495 --> 00:56:22,352
There is no reason for someone
who disobeys...

776
00:56:22,436 --> 00:56:24,041
by trying to take advantage
of a poor woman.

777
00:56:24,125 --> 00:56:26,363
I knew she was the reason. Susana.

778
00:56:26,447 --> 00:56:27,967
You fired him because of Susana
with out checking..

779
00:56:28,093 --> 00:56:29,149
If she had led him on.

780
00:56:29,233 --> 00:56:31,979
Didn't you say I'm fair?
Then let me be fair.

781
00:56:32,063 --> 00:56:36,200
Susana only has us to protect her
and Jesus behaved like a...

782
00:56:36,284 --> 00:56:38,690
And why are you so upset?
It's not that bad.

783
00:56:38,775 --> 00:56:41,519
Not bad to have this happen
in my own house?

784
00:56:41,604 --> 00:56:44,306
To have him dishonor the respect
a woman deserves?

785
00:56:44,391 --> 00:56:46,713
Come on!
And you are defending Jesus!

786
00:56:49,372 --> 00:56:52,496
I'd rather be quiet.
Good night, Guadalupe.

787
00:57:06,472 --> 00:57:09,638
What's the matter with you?
You don't even say good morning.

788
00:57:09,723 --> 00:57:12,424
Hello, Felisa. Tell my mother
I'll be back late from the fields.

789
00:57:12,510 --> 00:57:16,225
You'll bring more bugs from the fields
with all the cockroaches we have here?

790
00:57:16,309 --> 00:57:17,955
You're so serious!

791
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:19,812
I bet you haven't had breakfast.

792
00:57:19,897 --> 00:57:21,037
I had a glass of milk.

793
00:57:21,121 --> 00:57:23,571
If you'll just wait a minute
I'll get you a sandwich and...

794
00:57:23,698 --> 00:57:26,906
Imagine that! Leaving while
I'm still talking!

795
00:57:29,777 --> 00:57:33,534
It's almost eight and that bum
is still sleeping.

796
00:57:33,618 --> 00:57:34,801
We'll see about that.

797
00:57:46,242 --> 00:57:49,958
Wow, you're still in bed.

798
00:57:50,043 --> 00:57:52,111
They didn't bring you
your chocolate milk?

799
00:57:52,196 --> 00:57:54,813
You were still in bed, that's why.

800
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:58,063
As the saying goes: "From the street
will come she who will...

801
00:57:58,149 --> 00:57:59,204
throw you out of your own house".

802
00:57:59,288 --> 00:58:01,357
"Raise crows and they will
tear your eyes out".

803
00:58:01,442 --> 00:58:03,891
- What the hell are you thinking?
- You joked about the chocolate.

804
00:58:04,017 --> 00:58:07,057
Like I'd serve you chocolate,
you good-for-nothing.

805
00:58:07,986 --> 00:58:10,856
I can never get angry
in the morning.

806
00:58:10,983 --> 00:58:13,095
Maybe because I'm young.

807
00:58:13,179 --> 00:58:16,683
I can't hear a word.
I'm made of wood.

808
00:58:17,992 --> 00:58:22,172
Holy Mary, give me patience
and give me an answer...

809
00:58:23,015 --> 00:58:27,069
Get up, get dressed and go clean
the dining room and patio ﬂoors.

810
00:58:27,196 --> 00:58:29,349
Without breakfast, boss?

811
00:58:29,433 --> 00:58:32,515
God knows his doings.
If I were your boss I'd have...

812
00:58:32,599 --> 00:58:34,963
All the bread they put to waste
by giving it to you...

813
00:58:35,048 --> 00:58:37,497
If you feel so bad about it
imagine if it was your bread.

814
00:58:37,623 --> 00:58:39,693
If it was mine, I wouldn't even
give you a drop of water.

815
00:58:39,778 --> 00:58:41,087
Christian soul.

816
00:58:41,171 --> 00:58:42,817
She's damned!

817
00:58:42,901 --> 00:58:45,139
I have to control myself.

818
00:58:46,153 --> 00:58:49,107
You big mouth lazy bum!

819
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:53,203
I've already paid for my sins.
I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner.

820
00:59:08,445 --> 00:59:11,441
- You haven't started yet?
- I was starting right now.

821
00:59:11,527 --> 00:59:13,341
When you're done with this.
get your rags...

822
00:59:13,426 --> 00:59:15,410
and move into one of
the workers' cabins.

823
00:59:15,494 --> 00:59:17,057
Felisa will tell you where.

824
00:59:17,565 --> 00:59:19,422
But. madam. me. over there?

825
00:59:19,506 --> 00:59:22,925
We all feel more comfortable
where we belong.

826
00:59:23,010 --> 00:59:24,910
I just wanted to know if I've done
something wrong.

827
00:59:25,037 --> 00:59:27,823
And by asking for an explanation
you're out of place.

828
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:31,877
I know there are people
here who dislike me, madam.

829
00:59:31,961 --> 00:59:35,085
But it's not my fault if I'm different
from the gossipers who...

830
00:59:35,170 --> 00:59:37,069
Go do as I said.

831
00:59:37,702 --> 00:59:39,517
Felisa, let's take care
of our things.

832
00:59:45,471 --> 00:59:46,822
You can take her, Pascual.

833
00:59:47,709 --> 00:59:50,495
She's a beauty, no doubt
But your mare is unique.

834
00:59:50,579 --> 00:59:53,577
You're right. But how could
she get so sick?

835
00:59:53,661 --> 00:59:57,757
When the time comes we all.
humans and animals. have to go.

836
00:59:57,842 --> 01:00:01,345
I hate seeing her suffer but I can't
get myself to putting her to sleep.

837
01:00:01,430 --> 01:00:04,765
Let's wait one more day.
There's always hope.

838
01:00:04,849 --> 01:00:07,171
Tomorrow I can give her
a lethal injection.

839
01:00:07,256 --> 01:00:10,212
No, if she has to die.
I'll help her out...

840
01:00:10,297 --> 01:00:12,112
and with the same gun
I killed her mother.

841
01:00:12,196 --> 01:00:13,716
I understand, Mr. Guadalupe.

842
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:17,473
It's very difficult, but killing who
you love is proof of your love.

843
01:00:17,558 --> 01:00:21,061
- See you tomorrow, Mr. Severiano.
- Yes. and we'll see.

844
01:00:37,402 --> 01:00:39,934
I think these duties
are too arduous for you.

845
01:00:40,821 --> 01:00:43,523
I'll ask my wife to give you
more decent work.

846
01:00:43,607 --> 01:00:45,549
You're so good to me, Sir, that...

847
01:00:45,676 --> 01:00:47,618
I don't like to see anyone
out of place.

848
01:00:47,703 --> 01:00:49,096
What were you saying?

849
01:00:49,181 --> 01:00:52,515
Nothing, sir.
I've already inconvenienced enough.

850
01:00:54,585 --> 01:00:56,146
I order you to tell me.

851
01:00:58,932 --> 01:01:01,087
I can't deny you anything, sir.

852
01:01:01,171 --> 01:01:03,957
But how can the madam agree
to give me delicate chores...

853
01:01:04,042 --> 01:01:06,955
after she asked me to move
to the workers' quarters.

854
01:01:07,588 --> 01:01:09,657
She's a very good woman
and I must obey her.

855
01:01:10,712 --> 01:01:13,076
That seems strange
because she's incapable of...

856
01:01:14,808 --> 01:01:17,130
It must be Felisa's doing
I just know it.

857
01:01:17,890 --> 01:01:19,536
- Rosario!
- At your service, sir.

858
01:01:19,621 --> 01:01:20,676
Come here.

859
01:01:23,884 --> 01:01:25,911
- Finish washing the ﬂoor.
- As you wish.

860
01:01:25,996 --> 01:01:28,445
No, sir. Mrs. Carmen will
think I've disobeyed her and...

861
01:01:28,529 --> 01:01:29,922
Go rest, Susana. Go.

862
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:49,808
It's nice to be young and strong.

863
01:01:49,892 --> 01:01:52,974
If you're done with the ﬂoors
I have an other task for you.

864
01:01:53,524 --> 01:01:57,534
Rosario is not done yet.
but I'll tell her to hurry up.

865
01:01:57,618 --> 01:02:00,490
What are you talking about?
Rosario?

866
01:02:00,574 --> 01:02:02,431
She's finishing up the ﬂoors.

867
01:02:02,516 --> 01:02:06,189
I can't do such arduous chores.

868
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:09,018
Are you making fun of me.
you shameful woman?

869
01:02:09,102 --> 01:02:11,045
With all the respect
I have for you?

870
01:02:11,171 --> 01:02:12,902
Not at all.

871
01:02:12,987 --> 01:02:16,532
But I'm delicate and if I get
tired I start coughing.

872
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:19,742
See?

873
01:02:19,869 --> 01:02:22,107
Then wear some lemons
around your neck...

874
01:02:22,191 --> 01:02:24,175
because my dog
died from the same cough.

875
01:02:24,259 --> 01:02:25,864
How insolent!

876
01:02:25,948 --> 01:02:28,650
Don't bite your tongue.
you might poison yourself.

877
01:02:28,734 --> 01:02:32,534
You're not obeying us?
Fine, we'll see about that.

878
01:02:35,447 --> 01:02:36,714
Mrs. Carmen.

879
01:02:39,162 --> 01:02:41,569
As the saying goes: "The jug goes
to the water so many times...

880
01:02:41,653 --> 01:02:42,962
until it finally breaks".

881
01:02:43,850 --> 01:02:45,158
What's the matter, Felisa?

882
01:02:45,243 --> 01:02:48,452
This little princess made Rosario
wash the ﬂoors...

883
01:02:48,536 --> 01:02:50,646
because she's very delicate
and she coughs.

884
01:02:52,504 --> 01:02:55,459
That can't be true.
You're exaggerating, as always.

885
01:02:55,544 --> 01:02:58,289
I asked you to wash the ﬂoors
and you'll wash them...

886
01:02:58,373 --> 01:02:59,724
until they shine, go.

887
01:02:59,808 --> 01:03:01,539
Yes, madam. As you wish.

888
01:03:01,623 --> 01:03:02,848
Good-for-nothing!

889
01:03:02,932 --> 01:03:06,057
If you're so obedient, why did
you stop washing them? Tell me.

890
01:03:06,563 --> 01:03:09,011
I'll tell you because
you're ordering me.

891
01:03:09,138 --> 01:03:10,448
Mr. Guadalupe...

892
01:03:10,532 --> 01:03:14,712
He very well knows I'm the one
who orders the house help.

893
01:03:14,796 --> 01:03:19,102
I know that, but I got confused
with all the contradicting orders.

894
01:03:19,862 --> 01:03:22,608
It might me better
if you told him.

895
01:03:23,409 --> 01:03:26,407
Leave this house immediately!
Leave!

896
01:03:26,491 --> 01:03:29,025
Madam, I'll do as you wish.
but don't send me away.

897
01:03:29,151 --> 01:03:30,038
Go away!

898
01:03:31,811 --> 01:03:34,343
What's the matter?
ls there a problem?

899
01:03:34,850 --> 01:03:36,835
A problem? No problem at all.

900
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:39,537
I'm just firing this girl, that's all.

901
01:03:40,508 --> 01:03:42,492
Listen. you're very nervous.

902
01:03:42,619 --> 01:03:44,941
Of course, if you're right
I won't argue.

903
01:03:45,025 --> 01:03:48,277
If I'm right?
You can doubt me if you wish.

904
01:03:48,361 --> 01:03:49,966
We'll talk after Susana is gone.

905
01:03:50,050 --> 01:03:51,739
Until then, I have nothing
to say to you.

906
01:03:51,823 --> 01:03:53,427
Calm down. woman.

907
01:03:53,512 --> 01:03:56,129
I should know why she's leaving
before she goes.

908
01:03:56,213 --> 01:03:57,396
Can you explain?

909
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:59,886
Did you explain to me
why Jesus left?

910
01:03:59,971 --> 01:04:02,463
You handle the workers
I'll handle the maids.

911
01:04:02,547 --> 01:04:04,827
You do as you wish
and so do I.

912
01:04:04,911 --> 01:04:08,837
- I insist on knowing.
- We're in Wont of the maids.

913
01:04:08,922 --> 01:04:11,666
- Can't you see?
- Even better.

914
01:04:11,750 --> 01:04:14,621
It will be settled sooner
since it's regarding one of them.

915
01:04:15,297 --> 01:04:17,239
You're Wee to not give
me an explanation.

916
01:04:17,323 --> 01:04:20,025
- But if that's the case I'll have to...
- What?

917
01:04:25,007 --> 01:04:27,288
For the good of my home
I'll be forced to order..

918
01:04:27,372 --> 01:04:30,369
This gill to stay until
there's a full explanation for it.

919
01:04:30,961 --> 01:04:31,974
That's all.

920
01:06:10,134 --> 01:06:13,006
I came to get you, honey.
I can't live without you.

921
01:06:13,597 --> 01:06:15,708
You're alone and I love you.
You know that.

922
01:06:15,792 --> 01:06:17,523
I'll take care of you and give you
all you want.

923
01:06:17,607 --> 01:06:20,056
For the last time, Jesus,
go take care of your life.

924
01:06:20,182 --> 01:06:21,618
I'm here and here I'll stay.

925
01:06:21,745 --> 01:06:23,097
Don't provoke me, Susana.

926
01:06:23,181 --> 01:06:24,996
I'm not leaving without you,
no matter what.

927
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:26,558
Are you sure?

928
01:06:26,642 --> 01:06:29,766
I love you, I need you like
the fields need the sun...

929
01:06:29,851 --> 01:06:31,666
I've seen many men like you.

930
01:06:31,751 --> 01:06:33,566
You think I'll throw all this away
for you?

931
01:06:33,651 --> 01:06:36,184
With all the disgust I feel for you?

932
01:06:36,269 --> 01:06:37,283
Let go of me!

933
01:06:39,013 --> 01:06:42,305
No, you're not a purebred bitch
like I thought.

934
01:06:42,728 --> 01:06:44,839
You're a viper, a slut.

935
01:06:45,388 --> 01:06:48,258
You will now know who I am
and what I'm capable of.

936
01:06:48,342 --> 01:06:52,016
I promise you'll find out soon
even if it kills me!

937
01:06:52,861 --> 01:06:54,296
I promise you!

938
01:06:54,381 --> 01:06:55,478
Let go of me!

939
01:07:20,853 --> 01:07:22,668
Susana. what's wrong?

940
01:07:23,849 --> 01:07:25,116
Come here.

941
01:07:30,521 --> 01:07:32,379
What's the matter?
Why are you crying?

942
01:07:33,139 --> 01:07:34,743
I feel horrible, sir.

943
01:07:34,827 --> 01:07:38,120
Why did I have to bring
discord to this house? Why?

944
01:07:38,205 --> 01:07:39,682
It's not your fault.

945
01:07:40,949 --> 01:07:42,680
Mrs. Carmen is a saint and I...

946
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:45,931
I thought it was harsh making
me live with the workers...

947
01:07:46,015 --> 01:07:48,126
but I should have left this house
like she wanted.

948
01:07:48,210 --> 01:07:51,335
Don't even think about it anymore.
It's over.

949
01:07:51,419 --> 01:07:55,811
No, Mrs. Carmen is suffering
I have to leave, sir.

950
01:07:57,415 --> 01:08:00,877
I have offered you my support.
my affection.

951
01:08:03,071 --> 01:08:05,605
That's the only thing that's
stopping me from leaving.

952
01:08:06,111 --> 01:08:10,081
You look at me like a human being.
not like other men, who...

953
01:08:11,769 --> 01:08:13,500
You felt sorry for me.

954
01:08:13,585 --> 01:08:19,538
Not son"y. I felt affection,
fondness, justice, it's different.

955
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:22,367
Not sorry.

956
01:08:28,995 --> 01:08:32,753
Maybe that's why I should leave.
Even if it destroys me.

957
01:08:35,539 --> 01:08:36,763
Forgive me. sir.

958
01:08:38,368 --> 01:08:39,719
Get up.

959
01:08:41,112 --> 01:08:44,573
Forgive me, but if I couldn't
see you anymore...

960
01:08:44,701 --> 01:08:46,263
I don't know what I would do.

961
01:08:58,550 --> 01:08:59,731
<i>I want you.</i>

962
01:09:42,119 --> 01:09:43,260
Leave me now.

963
01:10:07,156 --> 01:10:09,309
Madam... Mrs. Carmelita.

964
01:10:10,364 --> 01:10:12,222
You look like the Magdalene.

965
01:10:13,278 --> 01:10:15,093
Take a sip.
It will calm you down.

966
01:10:17,036 --> 01:10:18,597
Leave me alone. Felisa.

967
01:10:19,653 --> 01:10:22,988
Leave me alone.
I need to be alone.

968
01:10:24,930 --> 01:10:26,703
I am alone!

969
01:10:27,759 --> 01:10:28,942
For God's sake.

970
01:10:44,816 --> 01:10:45,955
I beg you, go away.

971
01:10:46,041 --> 01:10:47,054
Don't be afraid.

972
01:10:47,138 --> 01:10:50,135
I had to talk to you, Susana.

973
01:10:51,233 --> 01:10:53,597
Not now.
tomorrow in the fields.

974
01:10:53,681 --> 01:10:56,975
You think I can wait until tomorrow?
Do you not know I love you?

975
01:10:57,059 --> 01:10:59,508
I know, tell me everything
tomorrow.

976
01:10:59,593 --> 01:11:01,492
I don't know if you'll still
be here.

977
01:11:01,577 --> 01:11:03,476
I know my mother
wanted to fire you.

978
01:11:03,561 --> 01:11:06,010
My father is so upset
he's a different man.

979
01:11:06,094 --> 01:11:09,430
They can make you leave
but I can't lose you!

980
01:11:09,514 --> 01:11:11,415
Everything will be fine.
I'm sure.

981
01:11:11,499 --> 01:11:13,863
Now go, it would be horrible
if they found us together.

982
01:11:13,947 --> 01:11:17,114
Maybe it's best you leave.
I'll take you to town.

983
01:11:17,198 --> 01:11:19,985
I'll visit you everyday.
You'll have all you want.

984
01:11:21,632 --> 01:11:22,645
Let me go!

985
01:11:24,376 --> 01:11:26,064
We'll talk tomorrow, Alberto.

986
01:11:26,149 --> 01:11:28,640
Now go, let me think.
Go.

987
01:11:28,724 --> 01:11:31,004
- Susana, please.
- See you tomorrow. Go.

988
01:11:33,327 --> 01:11:34,678
Please!

989
01:11:54,056 --> 01:11:56,082
What are you doing here
at this time of the night?

990
01:11:56,167 --> 01:11:57,729
I wanted to talk to Susana, father.

991
01:11:57,813 --> 01:12:01,825
What is so important and why
were you forcing her door open?

992
01:12:01,909 --> 01:12:03,471
- Don't say that.
- Answer me!

993
01:12:04,569 --> 01:12:08,114
What do you need to tell her in
the middle of the night like a thief?

994
01:12:08,242 --> 01:12:10,310
That's my business
and no one else's.

995
01:12:10,394 --> 01:12:13,267
Are you mad? How dare you
speak to me like that?

996
01:12:13,815 --> 01:12:16,517
- You called me a thief!
- For lack of a better word.

997
01:12:16,602 --> 01:12:18,670
Answer me! What are
you doing here?

998
01:12:18,797 --> 01:12:21,752
I love Susana.
and no one can stop me.

999
01:12:24,455 --> 01:12:27,073
Tomorrow morning
you'll go back to Mexico City.

1000
01:12:27,790 --> 01:12:30,407
Now go back to your room
and give me the key to it.

1001
01:12:30,492 --> 01:12:32,307
You're going to lock me in?

1002
01:12:32,391 --> 01:12:34,629
I'm not a kid anymore
and I'm not afraid of you.

1003
01:12:34,713 --> 01:12:36,782
You can deny me anything
but being in love.

1004
01:12:38,049 --> 01:12:40,287
Either you obey me or I won't
be responsible for my actions.

1005
01:12:40,371 --> 01:12:43,031
I'll leave, but I won't go
back to school.

1006
01:12:43,157 --> 01:12:44,762
I'm going to start my life off
with Susana.

1007
01:12:44,846 --> 01:12:45,775
What did you say?

1008
01:12:45,901 --> 01:12:48,983
If you don't go back to your room
right now, I'll drag you there.

1009
01:12:49,068 --> 01:12:50,842
Don't touch me, father.
because if you do...

1010
01:12:50,926 --> 01:12:52,235
Alberto!

1011
01:12:59,707 --> 01:13:02,029
Come with me. son. Come.

1012
01:13:04,944 --> 01:13:06,083
Let me go, mother.

1013
01:13:06,209 --> 01:13:07,308
Calm down.

1014
01:13:17,018 --> 01:13:20,986
How could you raise a fist
to your father? How?

1015
01:13:21,071 --> 01:13:22,464
He wanted to hit me.
force me to...

1016
01:13:22,549 --> 01:13:23,984
Even so, Alberto.

1017
01:13:24,068 --> 01:13:26,179
He's your father.
you owe him your life.

1018
01:13:26,644 --> 01:13:28,713
He's violent, strict.
but he's not bad.

1019
01:13:29,304 --> 01:13:33,357
What was the reason for that?
You feel guilty about something.

1020
01:13:33,441 --> 01:13:37,832
- I don't. You're being unfair.
- Then, tell me.

1021
01:13:38,634 --> 01:13:39,985
Tell me, open up.

1022
01:13:40,070 --> 01:13:43,237
I'm your mother and I'll help you,
no matter what it is.

1023
01:13:44,166 --> 01:13:45,981
Trust me, I'll help you.

1024
01:13:47,247 --> 01:13:48,767
You didn't do anything
wrong, did you?

1025
01:13:48,852 --> 01:13:50,625
First he called me a thief
and then...

1026
01:13:50,751 --> 01:13:53,411
- What?
- You make me feel like a criminal.

1027
01:13:53,495 --> 01:13:55,142
As if love were a crime.

1028
01:13:56,114 --> 01:13:59,195
SO. you're in love?

1029
01:13:59,786 --> 01:14:03,459
Yes, mother. I'm in love
and it's eternal.

1030
01:14:05,612 --> 01:14:09,202
I should have guessed.
After all. you're a man now.

1031
01:14:10,299 --> 01:14:13,255
Who is she, son?
If you love her she must be good.

1032
01:14:13,677 --> 01:14:14,478
Who is she?

1033
01:14:14,563 --> 01:14:16,842
Right? She must be good, right?

1034
01:14:16,970 --> 01:14:19,756
I knew you would understand.
It's Susana.

1035
01:14:25,118 --> 01:14:27,103
- Mother...
- You too!

1036
01:14:30,142 --> 01:14:31,619
What's the matter, mother?
Wail!

1037
01:14:37,995 --> 01:14:40,486
Dear God! Dear God!

1038
01:14:40,571 --> 01:14:43,525
Tears are for what can't
be remedied, madam.

1039
01:14:43,610 --> 01:14:46,313
"God helps those
who help themselves."

1040
01:14:46,397 --> 01:14:48,972
You have to throw that bitch out.

1041
01:14:49,057 --> 01:14:52,139
God forgive me, but I've felt
like killing her.

1042
01:14:52,223 --> 01:14:54,925
I knew she was the devil
and she'd ruin our lives.

1043
01:14:55,009 --> 01:14:55,980
Throw her out!

1044
01:14:56,572 --> 01:14:57,627
No, Felisa.

1045
01:14:57,711 --> 01:15:00,625
Can't you see they're both crazy?
My husband and my son.

1046
01:15:00,709 --> 01:15:02,272
I can't believe it.

1047
01:15:03,833 --> 01:15:06,535
They would kill each other for her.
they'd go after her.

1048
01:15:08,267 --> 01:15:09,744
There must be a way.

1049
01:15:10,715 --> 01:15:12,531
Something that will
open their eyes.

1050
01:15:13,460 --> 01:15:15,444
God can't forsake me.

1051
01:15:15,571 --> 01:15:17,935
No, madam. Throw her out.

1052
01:15:18,061 --> 01:15:20,974
As the saying goes:
"Shoot first, ask later."

1053
01:15:21,101 --> 01:15:23,254
Throw her out
before it's too late.

1054
01:15:23,339 --> 01:15:25,240
I have a hunch.
throw her out.

1055
01:15:25,324 --> 01:15:27,604
It's the right moment.
Throw her out!

1056
01:15:29,968 --> 01:15:33,007
Dear Lord, I don't ask for
anything for me.

1057
01:15:33,641 --> 01:15:36,047
I just want to save the home
you've given me.

1058
01:15:36,131 --> 01:15:40,101
Lord, give me your word
so they'll believe me,

1059
01:15:40,861 --> 01:15:43,478
and your hand to open
their eyes.

1060
01:15:43,562 --> 01:15:46,518
And give me tiger teeth to...

1061
01:16:30,427 --> 01:16:33,635
Get dressed. You'll leave this house
immediately, before I...

1062
01:16:34,352 --> 01:16:36,253
Did you hear me? Immediately.

1063
01:16:36,337 --> 01:16:38,195
I'll leave when the master
asks me to.

1064
01:16:38,279 --> 01:16:39,926
I'm ordering you
and that's enough.

1065
01:16:40,939 --> 01:16:41,065
What if you left
instead of me?

1066
01:16:41,065 --> 01:16:42,797
What if you left
instead of me?

1067
01:16:42,881 --> 01:16:44,063
How would that be?

1068
01:16:44,148 --> 01:16:46,765
Here, madam.
Don't get your hands dirty.

1069
01:16:47,483 --> 01:16:49,214
I'm Christian and I don't want to...

1070
01:16:49,298 --> 01:16:51,324
And you're also old.

1071
01:16:51,409 --> 01:16:53,774
I'm young and beautiful
and he wants me!

1072
01:16:53,858 --> 01:16:55,589
You let her offend you?

1073
01:16:55,674 --> 01:16:59,389
Even our Lord threw the merchants
out of the temple when he had enough.

1074
01:16:59,474 --> 01:17:00,909
Hither, madam!

1075
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:03,653
If you dare touch me.
I swear I'll make your husband...

1076
01:17:03,737 --> 01:17:04,962
throw you out of here.

1077
01:17:36,626 --> 01:17:38,822
Carmen, stop!
What have you done?

1078
01:17:38,906 --> 01:17:40,257
How could you?

1079
01:17:41,228 --> 01:17:42,411
She hates me.

1080
01:17:42,495 --> 01:17:44,394
She hates me because
you protect me.

1081
01:17:44,479 --> 01:17:46,041
Because I love you.

1082
01:17:47,097 --> 01:17:49,039
That's why she wants
to throw me out.

1083
01:17:50,939 --> 01:17:54,275
No, you won't be the one
to leave this house.

1084
01:17:54,359 --> 01:17:55,626
Father!

1085
01:18:03,267 --> 01:18:06,814
You're right.
I should leave.

1086
01:18:06,898 --> 01:18:08,207
You're crazy.

1087
01:18:08,291 --> 01:18:10,529
You're saying that because
of this slut.

1088
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:13,738
There she is.

1089
01:18:18,044 --> 01:18:19,775
Just a moment. Come in, sirs.

1090
01:18:21,210 --> 01:18:22,899
What do you want?

1091
01:18:23,574 --> 01:18:25,813
- And who are these people?
- They come for her, sir.

1092
01:18:25,897 --> 01:18:27,122
It's not true!

1093
01:18:27,671 --> 01:18:28,768
What?

1094
01:18:28,853 --> 01:18:30,921
I'm from the State Reformatory.

1095
01:18:31,005 --> 01:18:34,172
This woman escaped our facility
and we've been looking for her.

1096
01:18:34,932 --> 01:18:37,212
You shouldn't have given
her shelter. She's dangerous.

1097
01:18:37,718 --> 01:18:39,957
It's not true! It's not time!

1098
01:18:49,329 --> 01:18:50,680
And you knew.

1099
01:18:50,764 --> 01:18:52,622
I can't even face you, boss.

1100
01:18:52,707 --> 01:18:55,873
And why didn't you say anything?

1101
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:58,279
Do I need to explain?

1102
01:19:01,488 --> 01:19:02,754
You're right.

1103
01:19:07,695 --> 01:19:11,198
- Officer, proceed with your duty.
- Take her away.

1104
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:13,310
Father!

1105
01:19:19,305 --> 01:19:21,079
Damn you!

1106
01:19:21,163 --> 01:19:22,682
Let go of me!

1107
01:19:23,781 --> 01:19:25,511
I'll tear her eyes out!

1108
01:19:25,596 --> 01:19:27,158
Throw her out!

1109
01:19:27,664 --> 01:19:29,987
I told you she was the devil.

1110
01:20:03,171 --> 01:20:05,704
- Good morning, mother.
- Good morning, son.

1111
01:20:05,831 --> 01:20:07,055
Did you sleep well?

1112
01:20:12,417 --> 01:20:14,486
I'm sure you'll sleep
better tonight.

1113
01:20:18,202 --> 01:20:21,918
In the bedroom I left you a letter
to say what I can't say face to face.

1114
01:20:22,550 --> 01:20:24,492
There you will find
my address in Mexico City.

1115
01:20:24,576 --> 01:20:27,574
Son, are you seated at the table
before your father again?

1116
01:21:03,630 --> 01:21:07,091
It's a beautiful morning.
pure heaven.

1117
01:21:07,176 --> 01:21:09,751
- There are no ﬂies even.
- Excuse-me.

1118
01:21:11,144 --> 01:21:13,256
What do you want, Jesus?
Come in.

1119
01:21:17,478 --> 01:21:19,968
Before leaving I wanted
to come tell you...

1120
01:21:20,054 --> 01:21:22,248
that the mare's fever is gone.

1121
01:21:22,375 --> 01:21:25,162
Look how she trots happily.
as if nothing had happened.

1122
01:21:35,928 --> 01:21:37,617
It's a dream come true.

1123
01:21:38,503 --> 01:21:40,362
Then... goodbye, boss.

1124
01:21:41,333 --> 01:21:43,612
Goodbye, Alberto.
Goodbye, madam.

1125
01:21:45,048 --> 01:21:48,847
Get back to your duties, Jesus.
There's a lotto be done.

1126
01:21:48,973 --> 01:21:50,198
Yes, sir.

1127
01:21:51,888 --> 01:21:53,154
A real dream come time.

1128
01:21:53,238 --> 01:21:56,616
The rest was a nightmare.
The devil's nightmare.

1129
01:21:56,700 --> 01:21:58,768
This is God's will.

1130
01:21:59,305 --> 01:22:59,590
