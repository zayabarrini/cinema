1
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:33,749
Sister Viridiana.

2
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:41,874
Your uncle sent word that
he can't come see you take your vows.

3
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,832
Very well, Mother.

4
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,707
You seem unconcerned.

5
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:52,749
I hardly know him.
I met him once, years ago.

6
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:54,707
He invites you to visit him.

7
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:58,082
I'd rather not leave the convent.

8
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,832
He's in poor health.
He's your only relative.

9
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,249
You should bid him farewell
before taking your vows.

10
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:05,582
You'll never see him again.

11
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:10,165
Why should I go?
He never bothered about me before.

12
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:12,582
He's paid for your studies

13
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,582
and he just sent your dowry.
Does that mean nothing?

14
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,707
I'd prefer not to see
the outside world again,

15
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:21,624
but if you order me -

16
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:26,957
The retreat begins in a few days.
You may leave tomorrow.

17
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,874
Everything you need
for the trip is in your cell.

18
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:33,749
Try to show him some affection.

19
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:05,207
That's enough for today, Rita.

20
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,082
You like
the new rope I gave you?

21
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:09,082
Yes. It's got handles.

22
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,082
Go and play now.

23
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:25,374
- Leave it to me, miss.
- Hello.

24
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:28,374
Welcome, miss.

25
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:30,707
I am Ramona, Don Jaime's maid.

26
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:32,040
Pleased to meet you.

27
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:34,707
Excuse me.

28
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:40,790
- How are you, Uncle?
- Fine.

29
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:43,790
The bus was a bit late.
How was your journey?

30
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:47,707
Very nice.
What a peaceful place, Uncle.

31
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:50,790
You'll feel as if
you never left the convent.

32
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,457
How long will you stay?

33
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:56,707
I can only stay a few days.

34
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:58,957
Was it difficult to get permission?

35
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,582
No. Mother Superior
ordered me to come.

36
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:06,374
I mean so little to you
that you had to be ordered?

37
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:10,957
Frankly, yes.
I'm not a good liar, Uncle.

38
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:14,749
I respect you, and I'm grateful
for your material support.

39
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:17,790
But beyond that -
- No affection.

40
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:20,290
- None.
- You're right.

41
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:22,790
Loneliness has made me
self-centered.

42
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:26,832
I'm sorry we've seen little of each other.
Now it's too late, isn't it?

43
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,540
Yes, it's too late.

44
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:32,624
You've neglected the farm.

45
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,207
The weeds have taken over
these last 20 years.

46
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:41,707
And beyond the second floor,
the house is overrun with spiders.

47
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,290
I hardly ever go out.

48
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:45,040
It's true.

49
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,124
And when he does,
he makes me skip.

50
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,124
Come here, you rascal.

51
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:52,457
- Who is she?
- Ramona's daughter, Rita.

52
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:55,040
- Come here!
- She's a little animal.

53
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:59,790
You even walk like your aunt.

54
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,540
You've told me before.

55
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,749
There!
Even your voice is like hers.

56
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:01,832
She made her bed
on the floor, sir.

57
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:05,957
She's got something
like thorns in her suitcase.

58
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,832
Her nightgown is made
of coarse linen.

59
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:13,499
It must chafe her delicate skin.

60
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,832
That's enough now. Go to bed.

61
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:20,499
Yes, sir. Good night.

62
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:44,790
- Good morning, Moncho.
- Morning.

63
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,082
Morning, Rita.

64
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:49,207
- How will we behave today?
- Today? Good.

65
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:54,457
May I bother you
for a glass of milk?

66
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:59,499
Is it very difficult?

67
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:01,499
Nothing to it. Try it.

68
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,749
I don't know how.

69
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:06,082
Sit here.

70
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,624
Just pull hard.

71
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:13,082
- Grab it and-
- Quiet, kid.

72
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:15,207
Grab it. Don't be afraid.

73
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:17,499
Don Jaime's very good at it.

74
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,749
- Scram!
- I don't want to!

75
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:28,040
And take these buckets.
They're always in the way.

76
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:30,082
Don't be afraid, miss.

77
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:32,790
Shall I help you?
Give it a pull.

78
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:35,207
No, I can't.

79
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,290
I saw you in your nightgown.

80
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:38,624
What?

81
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:41,832
Is that true?

82
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:43,665
Yes, I saw you.

83
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,415
She's a little liar.

84
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:46,707
It's true.

85
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:50,832
Her hairpins fell out,
and she picked them up.

86
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:52,999
How did you see me?

87
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:54,707
From the terrace.

88
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:57,874
It's naughty to spy on people.

89
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:00,457
- Want to come to the henhouse?
- No.

90
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:12,707
Good morning.

91
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,374
Good morning, Uncle.

92
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:22,415
- You're up early.
- To see more of you.

93
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:25,290
I'm going to bake you
a delicious cake.

94
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,874
You're spoiling me.

95
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:28,957
What will I do
when I'm alone again?

96
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:31,165
You choose to be alone.

97
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:34,207
- What do you mean?
- Nothing.

98
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:38,665
Don't you trust me? Tell me.

99
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:41,624
Very well.
I can't hold things in.

100
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,374
Do you really have a son?

101
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,624
How did you know?

102
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:56,207
My mother mentioned it
years ago.

103
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:57,957
So it's true?

104
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:00,290
Yes, it is.

105
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,874
But what do you know of life?
You can't understand.

106
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,915
But I do. You should have
taken that child in.

107
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:10,582
His mother wanted to keep him.
She was a poor woman.

108
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,749
I was in love with your aunt.

109
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:15,540
I feared I'd lose her
if I told her.

110
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,790
That's why I didn't speak of it.

111
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,707
And the innocent child?

112
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:23,374
Don't worry.
He won't be forgotten.

113
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,624
You must think I'm a monster.

114
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:29,540
No, Uncle.
But it's a pity life's that way.

115
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,582
The poor thing would've drowned.

116
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,540
Who's there?

117
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:48,540
- Is she up yet?
- Hours ago.

118
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:51,124
She told me
to get her things ready.

119
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:56,957
It's her last day here.
I'll never see her again.

120
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:59,457
Why not ask her
to stay a few more days?

121
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:02,040
I did, but she shows no gratitude.

122
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,582
Sometimes I feel like hitting her.

123
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:08,749
And when I mention the convent,
she turns to stone.

124
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,207
Ramona, come here.

125
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:15,290
Sit down.

126
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,999
- I need your help.
- I'm at your service.

127
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:22,082
This is in our way. Have a seat.

128
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,082
Go ahead. Sit down.

129
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:28,207
Do you respect me?

130
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:30,415
I'd be ungrateful not to.

131
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:33,582
You took us in
when we had nowhere to turn.

132
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,832
Never mind that.

133
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,790
Would you do something
to help me?

134
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,957
Whatever you ask, sir.

135
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:47,332
Would you speak to her?
You women always know what to say.

136
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:50,790
Say something to make her stay
a few more days.

137
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,165
You're a good soul.
Speak to her.

138
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,499
I know I needn't even
offer you a reward,

139
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:03,915
but if you succeed,
I promise I won't forget you or Rita.

140
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:07,040
But why would she listen
to a servant?

141
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,290
You're right,
but we must do something.

142
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:13,832
You think of something, sir,
and I'll help any way I can.

143
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:16,999
Look in the cabinet
on the top shelf.

144
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:20,499
There's a little blue bottle
with no label.

145
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:22,832
There are some white pills inside.

146
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:25,915
This one?

147
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:28,040
Yes. Leave it there.

148
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,874
Now go back to work.
I'll tell you more later.

149
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:10,624
I never could do that.
I'm too nervous.

150
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:13,082
Why didn't you wake me?

151
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:16,124
- They say it's dangerous.
- Don't believe it.

152
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:20,874
I sleepwalked once years ago,
and they slapped me to wake me up.

153
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:23,457
And here I am, still alive.

154
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:25,832
I'm so sorry
I put ashes on your bed.

155
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:29,540
Why? It's no stranger
than anything else.

156
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,165
Sleepwalkers have no idea
what they're doing.

157
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:34,457
Ashes mean penitence

158
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:36,040
and death.

159
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,790
Penitence must be for you,
the nun-to-be,

160
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,249
and death is for this old man.

161
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:45,082
If you don't mind,
I'll see you off tomorrow in town.

162
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:46,165
Thank you, Uncle.

163
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:49,374
We must do something
special tonight as a farewell.

164
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,207
Whatever you wish.

165
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:57,374
I'd like to ask an innocent favor
that means a lot to me.

166
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:59,749
I can refuse you nothing today.

167
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:03,332
So you'll do it?

168
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,707
You have only to ask.

169
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:09,832
What am I saying?

170
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:12,290
This is silly.

171
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:14,749
It's hard to even ask you.

172
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,415
What a strange girl you are!

173
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:46,207
At first you seemed offended
and said no.

174
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:49,332
Now suddenly you make me
the happiest man in the world.

175
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:50,665
Thank you, my child.

176
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:53,624
I don't like masquerades,

177
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:56,165
but I decided to go along
with your whim.

178
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:58,999
It's neither a masquerade
nor a whim.

179
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,707
I'll tell you something
few people know.

180
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:06,749
Your aunt died in my arms
of a heart attack on our wedding night

181
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,582
wearing that dress.

182
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:10,915
You look just like her.

183
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:14,457
You must think I'm mad.

184
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:17,957
No, I'm pleased
I've made you happy.

185
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:21,540
Despite what I first thought,
you're a good man.

186
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:23,707
If you only knew.

187
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:26,874
I was full of high ideals
as a young man.

188
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,749
I wanted to do big things
to help others

189
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:33,832
and show my love of humanity.

190
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:36,665
But whenever I started anything,

191
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:41,290
I was afraid I'd be laughed at
and I felt ridiculous,

192
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:43,582
so it was back into my shell.

193
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:46,707
- Isn't that just cowardice?
- No.

194
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:51,457
I've proved I'm no coward
when faced with real danger.

195
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:57,124
Yet a simple visit from a well-meaning
stranger can unnerve me.

196
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,332
I can't take my eyes off you.

197
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:01,915
Come, let's sit down.

198
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:05,749
Uncle, don't think
I won't be sad to leave.

199
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:08,832
Don't leave then.
It's up to you.

200
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,790
Unfortunately -

201
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:13,540
It's all my fault.

202
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:18,874
If I'd seen you more often,
everything would be different.

203
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:20,040
Perhaps.

204
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:21,915
There is one way you could stay.

205
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:23,665
If I were to ask -

206
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:26,249
I mean, if I were to tell you -

207
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:30,999
I can't.

208
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:34,874
He wants you to marry him.

209
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:38,374
I'm sorry, sir.
If I didn't say it, you never would.

210
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:42,540
He loves you, and he deserves love.
He's a good man.

211
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,874
Are you serious?

212
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:53,040
I never want you
to leave this house.

213
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:56,790
You can't be in your right mind.

214
00:20:57,375 --> 00:21:00,790
I've been so happy here,
and now you've spoiled it all.

215
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:04,124
I'd better go back to my room.

216
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:06,582
Wait! Forgive me!

217
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:09,082
Stay just a few more minutes.

218
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:12,249
If you go now,
you'll always hold it against me.

219
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:14,832
I'll say nothing more
to upset you.

220
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:18,249
I'll put on some music
and we'll have some coffee. Sit down.

221
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:52,582
Here you are.

222
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:54,832
It will do you good.

223
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:20,999
- Why are you crying?
- I'm afraid.

224
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:24,415
- Nonsense. Go to sleep.
- I saw a black bull.

225
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:27,290
- A black bull?
- A real big one.

226
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,207
- Real, real big?
- Huge.

227
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:31,332
Surely he couldn't fit
through the door.

228
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,874
Then how did he get in, silly?

229
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:37,707
Through the cupboard.

230
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:39,999
You little liar,
get out of here.

231
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:41,999
I'm afraid.

232
00:22:42,916 --> 00:22:45,290
Here. Call your mother
if you have nightmares.

233
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,832
Go on now. Stop bothering me.

234
00:23:21,541 --> 00:23:23,665
You look tired.

235
00:23:23,875 --> 00:23:26,082
Perhaps you should go to bed.

236
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:39,082
Don't think badly of me.

237
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:41,749
I only want her near me.

238
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,540
Ramona, leave us.

239
00:26:49,458 --> 00:26:52,457
- What are you doing?
- Don Jaime kissed the lady.

240
00:26:52,666 --> 00:26:54,790
Because she's his niece.

241
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,749
I kiss you, don't I?

242
00:26:56,958 --> 00:26:58,457
You should be in bed.

243
00:26:58,666 --> 00:27:01,249
- A black bull came into my room.
- Hush.

244
00:27:01,458 --> 00:27:03,332
Come. I'll put you to bed.

245
00:27:17,875 --> 00:27:19,415
I'm thirsty.

246
00:27:26,208 --> 00:27:29,332
- How do you feel?
- My head aches.

247
00:27:29,541 --> 00:27:31,415
It'll pass soon.

248
00:27:32,541 --> 00:27:34,374
What happened to me?

249
00:27:34,583 --> 00:27:38,957
You fainted after supper.
The master and I carried you here.

250
00:27:39,166 --> 00:27:41,165
Did I sleep long?

251
00:27:41,375 --> 00:27:43,540
You slept well. Don't worry.

252
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:45,290
Bring me some water.

253
00:27:58,375 --> 00:27:59,457
Leave us, Ramona.

254
00:28:00,625 --> 00:28:02,124
Don't go.

255
00:28:02,958 --> 00:28:04,165
Go.

256
00:28:08,625 --> 00:28:10,415
Please go away, Uncle.

257
00:28:10,708 --> 00:28:12,749
I want to get up.
I have to leave.

258
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:14,665
You can never go.

259
00:28:14,875 --> 00:28:17,790
Last night you promised
not to speak of that again. Please go.

260
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,499
Who could be further apart
than an old recluse

261
00:28:22,708 --> 00:28:24,749
and a young woman
consecrated to God?

262
00:28:24,958 --> 00:28:26,749
I don't want to hear any more.

263
00:28:26,958 --> 00:28:29,082
I want to get dressed.

264
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:32,540
You've made me forget the passion
that sustained me all these years.

265
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,415
Go away!

266
00:28:35,375 --> 00:28:37,165
I must've been crazy.

267
00:28:37,375 --> 00:28:41,332
I hoped you would marry me,
but you refused, of course.

268
00:28:42,541 --> 00:28:44,832
And now it's the day
of your departure.

269
00:28:45,041 --> 00:28:49,457
I had to force you. It was the only way
to have you in my arms.

270
00:28:51,041 --> 00:28:53,832
- You're lying.
- No, it's true.

271
00:28:54,041 --> 00:28:56,582
I made you mine while you slept.

272
00:29:00,375 --> 00:29:02,499
Now you can't return
to your convent.

273
00:29:02,708 --> 00:29:04,915
You're not the same girl
who left there.

274
00:29:05,125 --> 00:29:07,832
You'll have to stay
with me here forever.

275
00:29:09,375 --> 00:29:11,165
But all I have will be yours.

276
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:12,915
If you don't want to marry me,

277
00:29:13,125 --> 00:29:14,957
if you'd rather live
as we have until now,

278
00:29:15,166 --> 00:29:18,374
as long as you're at my side,
I'll be happy.

279
00:29:18,583 --> 00:29:21,540
Think about it. Take your time.

280
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:23,124
Go away!

281
00:29:23,333 --> 00:29:24,790
Get out!

282
00:29:54,916 --> 00:29:57,499
- What did you tell her?
- That look she gave me!

283
00:29:57,708 --> 00:30:01,040
Now she hates me.
I've made a terrible mistake.

284
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:03,040
She's leaving,
and nothing can stop her.

285
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:06,124
Talk to her again.
Explain it all to her.

286
00:30:06,333 --> 00:30:08,832
What for?
She'll give me that same look.

287
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:10,415
I can't do it.

288
00:30:10,625 --> 00:30:13,832
But she might listen to you.
Try to convince her.

289
00:30:14,041 --> 00:30:16,374
- What can I say?
- The truth.

290
00:30:16,708 --> 00:30:19,624
Tell her I lied.
I didn't really take advantage of her.

291
00:30:19,833 --> 00:30:23,332
I meant to,
but I caught myself in time.

292
00:30:23,541 --> 00:30:27,624
Then I spent
the whole night thinking.

293
00:30:28,333 --> 00:30:31,457
I decided to lie so she wouldn't
return to the convent.

294
00:30:32,208 --> 00:30:33,790
Tell her that.

295
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:37,624
Go on.

296
00:30:54,916 --> 00:30:56,624
You must come right away.

297
00:31:11,375 --> 00:31:12,457
Let me go.

298
00:31:12,666 --> 00:31:14,707
Before you go,
you must listen to me.

299
00:31:14,916 --> 00:31:17,457
I've listened to you enough.
Let me go.

300
00:31:17,708 --> 00:31:21,040
It was all a lie.
I only said it to keep you here.

301
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:22,957
I only possessed you
in my thoughts.

302
00:31:23,166 --> 00:31:26,040
You can't leave
hating me like this.

303
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:28,499
Tell me you believe me,
and I'll let you go.

304
00:31:28,708 --> 00:31:31,832
You disgust me,
even if what you say is true.

305
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:36,207
So you won't forgive me?

306
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:12,540
You believe me, don't you?

307
00:32:15,625 --> 00:32:18,790
Don't lie.
You don't believe me either.

308
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,915
It's all very strange, sir.

309
00:32:21,125 --> 00:32:23,540
Never mind, my child.

310
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,624
Watch this.

311
00:32:43,666 --> 00:32:46,040
I didn't get it that time,
but you'll see.

312
00:32:46,875 --> 00:32:48,749
Bet you can't do this.

313
00:32:51,125 --> 00:32:54,207
- Look how high, Moncho.
- Don't bother me.

314
00:32:54,458 --> 00:32:56,499
I dropped it that time, but -

315
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:59,040
The carriage is ready, miss.

316
00:34:35,791 --> 00:34:37,165
Your suitcase, please.

317
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:56,207
- How are you, Miss Viridiana?
- Is something wrong?

318
00:34:56,416 --> 00:34:58,915
- You can't leave.
- Why?

319
00:34:59,125 --> 00:35:01,832
Something terrible has happened.

320
00:35:02,041 --> 00:35:03,082
Where?

321
00:35:03,291 --> 00:35:05,249
Please come with us.

322
00:35:19,583 --> 00:35:20,957
Over there.

323
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,499
Let go! It's mine!

324
00:36:21,708 --> 00:36:24,957
Show some respect for the dead
or I'll box your ears.

325
00:36:25,166 --> 00:36:26,915
Don't play under this tree.

326
00:36:27,125 --> 00:36:28,915
Don Jaime liked
to watch me jump rope.

327
00:36:29,125 --> 00:36:32,874
If something awful happens,
it'll be your fault!

328
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:32,790
You're not eating enough.
I've brought you some milk.

329
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,332
I'll fix some meat
for your supper.

330
00:37:36,083 --> 00:37:37,624
You look so pale.

331
00:37:38,416 --> 00:37:40,665
The mayor is seeing
to your request.

332
00:37:40,833 --> 00:37:43,124
You can go to the village
when you like.

333
00:37:43,333 --> 00:37:45,749
It'll do you good to get out.

334
00:37:48,541 --> 00:37:50,249
We have visitors.

335
00:37:51,541 --> 00:37:52,915
Leave me, Ramona.

336
00:38:00,333 --> 00:38:02,624
- You weren't expecting me, were you?
- Mother.

337
00:38:03,416 --> 00:38:05,957
How you must have suffered,
my child.

338
00:38:06,166 --> 00:38:08,957
I've been terribly concerned.

339
00:38:09,166 --> 00:38:12,624
We heard of the tragedy
only yesterday.

340
00:38:12,833 --> 00:38:14,874
We've all been so worried.

341
00:38:15,083 --> 00:38:18,832
But it took a while
to catch a train to see you.

342
00:38:19,041 --> 00:38:22,957
Why didn't you write?
We'd have come at once.

343
00:38:23,166 --> 00:38:26,832
- I've had so much to think about.
- You should have informed me.

344
00:38:27,708 --> 00:38:33,290
I spoke with the parish priest.
He told me what happened.

345
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:38,999
Why was this horrible offense against
Our Lord committed? Do you know?

346
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,874
I only know
my uncle was a great sinner,

347
00:38:43,083 --> 00:38:45,165
and I feel guilty for his death.

348
00:38:45,375 --> 00:38:49,540
How could you be to blame
for a man's suicide?

349
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:53,832
As Mother Superior,
I must hear your confession.

350
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:56,040
I'm not returning
to the convent.

351
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:59,207
Therefore, I owe no more obedience
than any other Catholic.

352
00:38:59,375 --> 00:39:03,707
Is there some serious impediment

353
00:39:03,916 --> 00:39:06,124
that prevents you
from taking your vows?

354
00:39:06,333 --> 00:39:10,707
I've done nothing wrong.
I only know I've changed.

355
00:39:10,875 --> 00:39:14,415
Weak as I am, I'll try to follow
the path the Lord shows me.

356
00:39:14,625 --> 00:39:17,790
Are you aware
of the pride in your words?

357
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,665
To what great plans
will you dedicate yourself?

358
00:39:20,875 --> 00:39:25,415
I know my weakness,
and I intend to work humbly.

359
00:39:25,625 --> 00:39:29,665
But however little I do,
I wish to do it alone.

360
00:39:31,583 --> 00:39:33,124
Very well.

361
00:39:33,333 --> 00:39:37,207
Since you won't allow me to help,
I'll leave you.

362
00:39:41,333 --> 00:39:43,832
I'm sorry to have disturbed you.

363
00:39:44,041 --> 00:39:45,415
Good-bye, my child.

364
00:39:47,375 --> 00:39:48,874
Mother Superior.

365
00:39:49,875 --> 00:39:52,082
Forgive me if I've offended you.

366
00:39:52,291 --> 00:39:53,999
You are forgiven.

367
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:17,957
- Why hasn't she come?
- She's still praying.

368
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:19,665
Very pious, eh?

369
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:22,624
She's going to pay us
to live with her.

370
00:40:22,833 --> 00:40:26,207
Spare a coin for the afflicted.

371
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:30,749
Pity a poor blind man.

372
00:40:31,416 --> 00:40:33,082
For charity's sake -

373
00:40:33,291 --> 00:40:34,832
She's coming.

374
00:40:35,041 --> 00:40:40,040
Your days of tripping
over cobblestones

375
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:42,749
and scuffling with kids are over.

376
00:40:44,083 --> 00:40:46,874
I'll take the little girl.
Come here, precious.

377
00:40:47,083 --> 00:40:49,582
- Everyone ready?
- Whenever you wish.

378
00:40:49,791 --> 00:40:51,165
Let's go.

379
00:40:56,416 --> 00:40:59,832
She has the face of an angel.
Pity you can't see her.

380
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:03,207
Spare me the compliments.
I don't like them.

381
00:41:09,708 --> 00:41:11,040
Here they come.

382
00:41:15,875 --> 00:41:17,415
Are you the other two?

383
00:41:18,916 --> 00:41:20,249
Come with me.

384
00:41:34,708 --> 00:41:38,374
What a strange man.
I wish I knew what he was like.

385
00:41:38,958 --> 00:41:42,290
He cared little enough for you.

386
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,290
I've never borne him any grudge.

387
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,874
Anyone can have a fling
and then walk away.

388
00:41:47,083 --> 00:41:49,582
But why acknowledge me
at the last moment?

389
00:41:49,791 --> 00:41:51,165
What did he have in mind?

390
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:53,124
He was a very good man.

391
00:41:53,333 --> 00:41:55,249
Better than some might think.

392
00:41:55,416 --> 00:41:58,874
- Why did he kill himself?
- I don't know, sir.

393
00:41:59,083 --> 00:42:01,665
It's not good
to be alone all the time.

394
00:42:01,875 --> 00:42:04,540
- I'm not like him, am I?
- Not in that respect.

395
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:06,582
You're always looking
for company.

396
00:42:07,041 --> 00:42:09,582
- What do you mean?
- You know.

397
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:13,749
Please don't.

398
00:42:13,958 --> 00:42:17,832
I'm sorry, but the master
would play for hours on end.

399
00:42:18,041 --> 00:42:20,207
It was a pleasure to hear him.

400
00:42:20,875 --> 00:42:23,499
I'll get the other suitcase.

401
00:42:30,458 --> 00:42:31,999
The air is wonderful here.

402
00:42:32,625 --> 00:42:35,915
Look how those fields
have been neglected.

403
00:42:36,375 --> 00:42:38,415
There's a lot to be done here,

404
00:42:39,166 --> 00:42:40,874
and nobody to boss me around.

405
00:42:41,083 --> 00:42:43,040
We won't have time to get bored.

406
00:42:45,291 --> 00:42:46,624
Aren't you happy?

407
00:42:48,125 --> 00:42:50,665
I don't know.
I wish I hadn't come.

408
00:42:52,125 --> 00:42:53,707
Look.

409
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:05,915
It's huge!

410
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:09,665
Good. There'll be room for all of us.
How many floors?

411
00:43:09,875 --> 00:43:11,082
Two.

412
00:43:11,291 --> 00:43:12,499
Are there many windows?

413
00:43:12,708 --> 00:43:17,915
Lots, and balconies too,
and two huge towers.

414
00:43:18,125 --> 00:43:20,374
Then it's quite a house.

415
00:43:23,916 --> 00:43:28,540
- Did you fix the windows?
- Yes, and I've set out blankets.

416
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:30,415
Show them their accommodations.

417
00:43:30,625 --> 00:43:32,665
She has a heart of gold.

418
00:43:32,875 --> 00:43:34,624
Yes, but she's a little nutty.

419
00:43:35,083 --> 00:43:38,082
Men and women will sleep
in separate dormitories,

420
00:43:38,291 --> 00:43:40,124
but we'll eat together.

421
00:43:40,333 --> 00:43:42,374
Tomorrow we'll find you
some better clothes.

422
00:43:42,625 --> 00:43:43,915
Viridiana.

423
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:49,082
- Jorge?
- Yes, Don Jaime's son.

424
00:43:49,291 --> 00:43:51,832
The lawyer told me
you were coming.

425
00:43:52,041 --> 00:43:54,707
This is Lucia. You'll like her.

426
00:43:55,791 --> 00:43:57,582
- What's your name?
- Don't touch me!

427
00:43:57,791 --> 00:43:59,915
You can sleep with the chickens!

428
00:44:02,458 --> 00:44:03,999
Keep moving.

429
00:44:07,791 --> 00:44:10,624
Stick your nose
where it doesn't belong

430
00:44:10,791 --> 00:44:12,582
and you'll hear from me.

431
00:44:12,791 --> 00:44:15,957
We may be poor,
but we have our dignity, brother.

432
00:44:16,166 --> 00:44:19,374
Don't "brother" me.
There's no scum in my family.

433
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:22,207
Even the servants
put on airs here.

434
00:44:22,416 --> 00:44:25,082
I'll punch your face in!

435
00:44:25,291 --> 00:44:28,749
- What's going on?
- This louse is looking for trouble.

436
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:31,874
- You're the louse!
- Don't talk like that.

437
00:44:32,083 --> 00:44:34,457
I've had it with all this piety.

438
00:44:34,916 --> 00:44:37,290
- That'll teach you manners.
- Blind freak!

439
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:38,790
Stop!

440
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,624
Stop fighting and go inside.
Moncho, show them the way.

441
00:44:41,833 --> 00:44:42,665
No.

442
00:44:42,875 --> 00:44:45,124
You stay here.

443
00:44:45,291 --> 00:44:47,415
What have I done
to deserve your insults?

444
00:44:47,625 --> 00:44:49,124
I'm just fed up.

445
00:44:49,333 --> 00:44:51,790
If you stay,
you'll have to learn some discipline,

446
00:44:52,083 --> 00:44:54,082
and some humility
with the others.

447
00:44:54,291 --> 00:44:56,290
Then I'd sooner leave.

448
00:44:57,333 --> 00:44:59,040
Can you spare some change?

449
00:45:03,166 --> 00:45:05,540
Only because I'm poor,
otherwise -

450
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,582
- You must be tired.
- I've never walked so much in my life.

451
00:45:20,666 --> 00:45:22,832
I feel refreshed now.

452
00:45:23,041 --> 00:45:26,540
- Let me do that, miss.
- I've spoiled him.

453
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:29,124
You can take this away, Ramona.

454
00:45:35,875 --> 00:45:38,749
- Supper is ready whenever you like.
- Let's have it now.

455
00:45:41,375 --> 00:45:43,165
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

456
00:45:43,375 --> 00:45:47,124
- Why the scowl?
- Viridiana gets on my nerves.

457
00:45:47,333 --> 00:45:50,999
- She's crazy.
- Not crazy. Rotten with piety.

458
00:45:51,208 --> 00:45:55,582
Let her be.
She's not bothering us.

459
00:45:57,541 --> 00:45:59,207
Know what I think?

460
00:45:59,416 --> 00:46:02,165
You're annoyed because
she takes no notice of you.

461
00:46:22,666 --> 00:46:24,457
That's all we needed!

462
00:46:24,666 --> 00:46:27,165
Where were you looking?
Look what you've done!

463
00:46:29,083 --> 00:46:31,624
Get something
to clean it up with.

464
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:34,207
I don't know
what's wrong with her.

465
00:46:34,416 --> 00:46:36,457
She's more stupid by the day.

466
00:46:37,583 --> 00:46:38,957
Anyway...

467
00:46:42,541 --> 00:46:44,749
I think I'll have
some more beans.

468
00:46:44,958 --> 00:46:47,624
- Give me a tomato.
- Pass me some bread.

469
00:46:48,458 --> 00:46:49,957
Here you go.

470
00:46:50,166 --> 00:46:51,707
As I was saying,

471
00:46:51,916 --> 00:46:55,332
before I was afflicted,
I used to sell pigs.

472
00:46:55,541 --> 00:46:57,624
I was honest
as my blessed mother.

473
00:46:57,833 --> 00:46:59,957
Didn't he come
from an orphanage?

474
00:47:00,166 --> 00:47:04,165
- I'll bash your teeth in!
- Don't listen to the little devil.

475
00:47:04,375 --> 00:47:05,540
Hey, Amalio.

476
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:08,124
Zequiel was asking me yesterday

477
00:47:08,333 --> 00:47:10,999
what happens
when you get an itch.

478
00:47:12,125 --> 00:47:15,332
How do you find
the place to scratch?

479
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:18,124
Tell Zequiel
that when I get an itch,

480
00:47:18,375 --> 00:47:20,332
I'll get his mother
to scratch it for me.

481
00:47:20,541 --> 00:47:21,582
Shut up and eat.

482
00:47:21,791 --> 00:47:25,290
Watch it, Amalio.
I've got my eye on you.

483
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:26,582
Good evening.

484
00:47:31,333 --> 00:47:32,665
Come in.

485
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:37,374
There's a seat for you
and one for you.

486
00:47:39,583 --> 00:47:41,624
These are your new companions.

487
00:47:44,583 --> 00:47:46,832
I expect you must be hungry.

488
00:47:49,875 --> 00:47:51,582
May God reward you.

489
00:47:52,416 --> 00:47:54,915
Did you enjoy your meal?

490
00:47:55,125 --> 00:47:58,832
I don't mean to criticize
our benefactress,

491
00:47:59,041 --> 00:48:02,874
but may I say
the beans were a bit acidic?

492
00:48:03,083 --> 00:48:05,665
- What's that mean?
- Sour.

493
00:48:05,875 --> 00:48:08,082
Pay no attention to him.
They're delicious.

494
00:48:08,291 --> 00:48:10,665
If Don Zequiel says it,
it must be true.

495
00:48:10,875 --> 00:48:12,957
We'll remedy that tomorrow.

496
00:48:13,166 --> 00:48:15,040
Now for good news.

497
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:17,665
Starting tomorrow,
everyone will have work.

498
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:19,457
Don't worry.

499
00:48:19,666 --> 00:48:22,874
It will all be according
to your interests and abilities.

500
00:48:23,083 --> 00:48:26,207
It's just to occupy you
and give you some exercise.

501
00:48:27,958 --> 00:48:32,749
I'm good in the kitchen,
especially with roasts and custards.

502
00:48:32,958 --> 00:48:36,165
- I cooked for last year's festival.
- Very good.

503
00:48:36,375 --> 00:48:39,332
I made a chorizo dish
that they're still talking about.

504
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:41,040
Very good.

505
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:45,457
You can help me
with the accounts.

506
00:48:46,916 --> 00:48:49,290
I can paint religious pictures.

507
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:51,040
I used to know how to write,

508
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:54,040
but with this handicap,
I've forgotten how.

509
00:48:56,083 --> 00:49:00,040
I used to weave,
but with this rheumatism,

510
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:01,457
not anymore.

511
00:49:03,208 --> 00:49:05,915
- What about you, Manuel?
- I'm only fit to be laughed at.

512
00:49:06,375 --> 00:49:10,290
There'll be laughter here,
but I'll see no one laughs at you.

513
00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:14,457
I'm a good gardener.
The priest will tell you.

514
00:49:14,666 --> 00:49:17,540
Then there'll be plenty
for you to do here.

515
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:21,290
Look at that! It's disgusting!

516
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:22,832
Let me see.

517
00:49:23,833 --> 00:49:26,707
- He's a leper!
- Throw him out! He'll infect us all.

518
00:49:30,041 --> 00:49:31,540
Let me see.

519
00:49:32,708 --> 00:49:34,707
They're varicose veins.

520
00:49:34,916 --> 00:49:37,082
I haven't been able
to have them looked after.

521
00:49:37,291 --> 00:49:40,832
- It's not contagious?
- The hospital said no.

522
00:49:41,041 --> 00:49:43,665
Don't listen to him, miss.
I know all about him.

523
00:49:43,875 --> 00:49:45,624
It isn't leprosy!

524
00:49:45,833 --> 00:49:48,665
I'll take you to the doctor tomorrow.
Sit down and eat.

525
00:49:49,291 --> 00:49:51,124
I don't think it's leprosy.

526
00:49:51,333 --> 00:49:55,832
Care for him like a sick brother.
Be compassionate.

527
00:49:56,791 --> 00:49:59,582
Now finish your meal,
and then off to bed.

528
00:49:59,791 --> 00:50:01,707
Everyone in bed by 8:00.

529
00:50:01,875 --> 00:50:05,082
Show our new companions
where to sleep.

530
00:50:05,291 --> 00:50:07,540
Good night, everyone.

531
00:50:16,416 --> 00:50:18,124
You, out.

532
00:50:20,208 --> 00:50:21,874
Clear out or I'll slit your belly.

533
00:50:22,083 --> 00:50:23,582
It's not your place.

534
00:50:24,416 --> 00:50:26,874
The lady said I could stay.

535
00:50:27,083 --> 00:50:28,790
Stab him if he doesn't go!

536
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,874
Calm down.

537
00:50:31,083 --> 00:50:33,665
If anyone's hurt,
we'll all be thrown out.

538
00:50:33,875 --> 00:50:35,165
Throw that trash out!

539
00:50:35,375 --> 00:50:36,999
All right, I'll go.

540
00:50:37,916 --> 00:50:41,624
You got your way for now,
but I'm still sleeping on the farm.

541
00:50:45,041 --> 00:50:47,124
Give me something
for the morning.

542
00:50:56,375 --> 00:50:59,874
- I'll come see you tonight.
- No, the kids sleep with me.

543
00:51:00,083 --> 00:51:02,915
- Let Refugio look after them.
- They'll start crying.

544
00:51:03,125 --> 00:51:05,124
Besides,
there's another woman now.

545
00:51:05,333 --> 00:51:07,790
Then I'll grab you
in the fields tomorrow.

546
00:51:19,791 --> 00:51:21,332
Pass the salt.

547
00:51:26,791 --> 00:51:28,165
Who's there?

548
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:36,832
You startled me.
Is something wrong?

549
00:51:37,041 --> 00:51:39,124
Isn't it time we had a talk?

550
00:51:39,333 --> 00:51:40,374
Is it so urgent?

551
00:51:40,583 --> 00:51:43,624
If not now, it'll never happen.

552
00:51:43,833 --> 00:51:48,582
If you're not with your paupers
or praying, you disappear.

553
00:51:49,583 --> 00:51:51,082
What's it about?

554
00:51:51,833 --> 00:51:54,415
First, the house.
I want electricity.

555
00:51:54,625 --> 00:51:58,957
Electric poles stand 50 yards away,
yet it's like the Middle Ages here.

556
00:51:59,166 --> 00:52:01,832
And I want to make
some other renovations.

557
00:52:02,041 --> 00:52:05,707
Then there's the land.
It mustn't lie idle.

558
00:52:05,916 --> 00:52:08,499
- I don't know a thing about that.
- But you have a say.

559
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:10,374
Do what you think best.

560
00:52:10,583 --> 00:52:13,707
- Is that all?
- No, there's much more.

561
00:52:13,916 --> 00:52:16,832
It's ridiculous
for us to live so close together

562
00:52:17,041 --> 00:52:19,790
and yet know nothing
about each other.

563
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,749
What do you
really know about me?

564
00:52:22,916 --> 00:52:25,290
You worked
in an architect's office.

565
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:29,082
And how about
what my mother and I went through?

566
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:32,165
Well, well.

567
00:52:33,541 --> 00:52:37,415
If Father had taken better care of us,
I'd be an architect now.

568
00:52:39,041 --> 00:52:42,415
How can you live like this
and spend so much time alone?

569
00:52:42,583 --> 00:52:44,790
I'm not like you.
You have your wife.

570
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,374
She's not my wife.

571
00:52:46,583 --> 00:52:49,957
I don't need anyone's blessing
to live with a woman.

572
00:52:53,333 --> 00:52:55,249
I can see that you -

573
00:52:55,458 --> 00:52:57,915
Well, I'd better go.

574
00:53:00,833 --> 00:53:02,874
If you must come again,
knock first,

575
00:53:03,083 --> 00:53:05,624
and wait until I tell you
to come in.

576
00:53:33,958 --> 00:53:36,457
Her face is yellow
to show she's ill.

577
00:53:36,666 --> 00:53:39,874
- Finish already. I'm all stiff.
- It's almost done.

578
00:53:40,083 --> 00:53:41,915
I don't like
sitting still for so long.

579
00:53:42,125 --> 00:53:44,707
No, you're the type
to wiggle around.

580
00:53:45,125 --> 00:53:48,249
- She looks like a squash.
- Don't mind him. It's very good.

581
00:53:48,458 --> 00:53:50,624
I don't like being the Virgin.

582
00:53:50,833 --> 00:53:52,207
I can imagine!

583
00:53:52,416 --> 00:53:54,957
Miss, would you pose for the Virgin?

584
00:53:55,166 --> 00:53:56,540
Me?

585
00:53:57,333 --> 00:53:59,374
Then she'll turn out
really beautiful.

586
00:53:59,583 --> 00:54:00,957
It'll just take a minute.

587
00:54:01,125 --> 00:54:03,665
This is for a lady
who was cured of the fever.

588
00:54:03,875 --> 00:54:05,999
The Virgin smiled on her.

589
00:54:06,208 --> 00:54:08,249
You seem very devoted
to Our Lady.

590
00:54:08,458 --> 00:54:10,999
I'm no saint,
but everyone has his own beliefs.

591
00:54:11,208 --> 00:54:15,374
And with my affliction and all,
if I didn't have faith -

592
00:54:17,375 --> 00:54:19,999
- Did you sleep well, miss?
- Very well, Refugio.

593
00:54:20,208 --> 00:54:21,415
A blessed morning.

594
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:24,124
- When is your baby due?
- Why?

595
00:54:24,333 --> 00:54:27,124
To let the doctor know.

596
00:54:27,333 --> 00:54:31,874
I think in about four months,
but I can't be sure.

597
00:54:32,083 --> 00:54:34,457
She's not so sure
about the father either.

598
00:54:34,666 --> 00:54:37,249
It was dark
and she couldn't see his face.

599
00:54:37,458 --> 00:54:39,832
Shut up!
You don't have to tell everyone!

600
00:54:40,041 --> 00:54:41,124
Quiet!

601
00:54:41,333 --> 00:54:45,457
That's no way to speak
before our blessed protectress.

602
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:48,082
I'm so sorry for you.

603
00:54:48,583 --> 00:54:49,957
Do you have other children?

604
00:54:50,166 --> 00:54:52,874
No, this is my first. Excuse me.

605
00:54:53,666 --> 00:54:56,749
- We're off to the village.
- By God's leave, and yours.

606
00:54:56,958 --> 00:54:58,915
I need potatoes, bacon and rice.

607
00:54:59,791 --> 00:55:02,332
Here.
And come back on time today.

608
00:55:02,541 --> 00:55:04,749
Could you bring back
some tobacco?

609
00:55:04,958 --> 00:55:08,707
Smoking's no good for him,
and he spits all over.

610
00:55:08,916 --> 00:55:11,124
Only when I smoke
cigarette butts.

611
00:55:11,333 --> 00:55:15,040
As for your vices,
I can't mention them in front of the lady.

612
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:18,124
That's enough.
Buy tobacco and I'll distribute it.

613
00:55:19,125 --> 00:55:21,124
Miss, come see the painting.

614
00:55:21,958 --> 00:55:23,915
Go on now.

615
00:55:27,791 --> 00:55:29,040
It's very good.

616
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:32,540
- She's still missing one eye.
- But I like it.

617
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,665
- How many feet?
- Fifty.

618
00:55:38,875 --> 00:55:40,624
Fifty by 23, right?

619
00:56:17,208 --> 00:56:19,665
Thanks for the lift, my friend.

620
00:56:19,833 --> 00:56:21,249
Sure, anytime.

621
00:56:25,291 --> 00:56:27,665
Hey, this dog's exhausted.

622
00:56:27,833 --> 00:56:30,165
Why not let him ride
in the cart?

623
00:56:30,791 --> 00:56:32,540
The cart's only for people.

624
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:34,665
At least untie him.
He'll follow you.

625
00:56:35,291 --> 00:56:37,582
What if he gets run over?

626
00:56:45,125 --> 00:56:46,790
I'll buy him from you.

627
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,707
He's good at hunting rabbits.

628
00:56:48,916 --> 00:56:52,457
He knows he'll starve
if he doesn't hunt.

629
00:56:52,666 --> 00:56:53,540
How much?

630
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:56,790
I didn't plan on selling him,
but pay me whatever you like.

631
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,499
Untie him.

632
00:57:02,333 --> 00:57:04,040
Thanks, and good-bye.

633
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:05,624
Drive on.

634
00:57:07,208 --> 00:57:10,165
Remember:
The less he eats, the better he hunts.

635
00:57:10,333 --> 00:57:12,040
- What's his name?
- Canelo.

636
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:15,457
Easy, boy. Come here, Canelo.

637
00:57:17,958 --> 00:57:20,957
Easy, Canelo.

638
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:42,624
What will you plant here?

639
00:57:42,833 --> 00:57:47,332
After lying fallow so long,
this soil could produce anything.

640
00:57:47,541 --> 00:57:50,582
This land is meant for wheat.
We used to grow corn above the orchard.

641
00:57:50,791 --> 00:57:53,290
- And in the orchard itself?
- That's good soil.

642
00:58:02,416 --> 00:58:05,624
A miraculous appearance!
Did you come to inspect the work?

643
00:58:05,833 --> 00:58:08,082
You know I don't know
a thing about it.

644
00:58:08,291 --> 00:58:10,999
The best thing my father left me
was the land.

645
00:58:11,208 --> 00:58:12,707
It will really show results.

646
00:58:12,916 --> 00:58:16,290
If you helped me,
this place would take shape in no time.

647
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:21,332
What are you doing here?
Beat it!

648
00:58:21,541 --> 00:58:22,707
Leave him alone.

649
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:26,457
You won't do much with these people.
Those days have gone.

650
00:58:26,666 --> 00:58:28,790
You should let me
kick them all out.

651
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,707
- They annoy you that much?
- Frankly, yes.

652
00:58:31,916 --> 00:58:33,624
Especially for your sake.

653
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:37,790
Helping a few beggars does nothing
for the thousands of others.

654
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,999
I'm well aware
how little I can do.

655
00:58:40,208 --> 00:58:42,665
I'd like to create a shelter -
with your consent -

656
00:58:42,875 --> 00:58:47,165
where they can find a roof,
some food and a little human warmth.

657
00:58:47,375 --> 00:58:50,499
- Will that be your life's work?
- I'm not sure.

658
00:58:50,708 --> 00:58:54,707
I'm only now recovering
from a recent shock.

659
00:58:55,125 --> 00:58:57,040
I may return
to the convent one day.

660
00:58:59,083 --> 00:59:00,874
We told you to clear out!

661
00:59:01,083 --> 00:59:03,457
Make me, coward!

662
00:59:05,958 --> 00:59:08,374
Why do they shout at him?
Do they have no feelings?

663
00:59:08,583 --> 00:59:10,624
I don't know. Ask him yourself.

664
00:59:19,208 --> 00:59:22,415
Those devils have tied
a can to him

665
00:59:22,625 --> 00:59:25,665
so they'll know
when he's coming.

666
00:59:27,875 --> 00:59:32,874
Why are you here?
I told you where you could walk.

667
00:59:33,083 --> 00:59:36,624
It's a lovely day,
so I just kept walking.

668
00:59:36,833 --> 00:59:38,999
How are you today? Have a seat.

669
00:59:39,208 --> 00:59:41,415
A little better, I think.

670
00:59:41,625 --> 00:59:43,165
Let's see your arm.

671
00:59:43,375 --> 00:59:47,707
You heard the doctor:
It should have been treated earlier.

672
00:59:47,916 --> 00:59:50,707
But with God's help,
you'll be cured one day.

673
00:59:51,333 --> 00:59:54,540
It's God's punishment,

674
00:59:54,750 --> 00:59:58,582
because I lay with a woman
one windy day,

675
00:59:58,791 --> 01:00:00,457
and I've had this ever since.

676
01:00:00,666 --> 01:00:03,499
You're the first good woman
I've ever met.

677
01:00:03,708 --> 01:00:07,207
- Are your parents alive?
- What good are they?

678
01:00:07,416 --> 01:00:10,457
- Don't say that.
- Fine, but still -

679
01:00:10,666 --> 01:00:13,665
Pay no attention to him.
He's no good.

680
01:00:13,916 --> 01:00:16,874
He wants you to catch it too.

681
01:00:17,083 --> 01:00:21,582
At church
he puts his arm in the holy water,

682
01:00:21,791 --> 01:00:23,540
and I've heard he says,

683
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:28,332
"May every goddamned woman
get what I have!"

684
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:31,582
The priest won't let him in.

685
01:00:31,791 --> 01:00:34,999
- He's a liar!
- Calm down.

686
01:00:35,208 --> 01:00:37,082
He's making it all up.

687
01:00:37,291 --> 01:00:39,082
You can ask the priest.

688
01:00:39,291 --> 01:00:42,499
That will do!
Go and join the others.

689
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:46,415
We need a cure
for that temper of yours as well.

690
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:50,874
This must have been
my grandfather's.

691
01:00:53,583 --> 01:00:55,707
Wake me up early tomorrow.

692
01:00:55,916 --> 01:00:59,832
- What for?
- To start my usual work earlier.

693
01:01:03,083 --> 01:01:04,582
Nice knife.

694
01:01:05,416 --> 01:01:07,540
My, my.

695
01:01:07,750 --> 01:01:09,540
You're happy, aren't you?

696
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:11,665
Any reason I shouldn't be?

697
01:01:11,875 --> 01:01:13,374
You, on the other hand -

698
01:01:13,583 --> 01:01:17,457
I'm bored, alone all day
with nothing to do.

699
01:01:17,666 --> 01:01:20,707
In a house like this
there's always plenty to do.

700
01:01:21,833 --> 01:01:23,915
Listen to this.

701
01:01:24,125 --> 01:01:25,749
Listen.

702
01:01:27,458 --> 01:01:29,749
What do you think?

703
01:01:29,958 --> 01:01:32,290
I think your cousin
is more to your taste.

704
01:01:33,583 --> 01:01:34,957
She's not my cousin.

705
01:01:35,166 --> 01:01:37,207
Whatever she is, you like her.

706
01:01:38,166 --> 01:01:40,290
I knew I shouldn't have come.

707
01:01:41,166 --> 01:01:43,624
Perhaps I should leave... and soon.

708
01:01:43,833 --> 01:01:47,707
We can talk about that
some other time.

709
01:01:47,916 --> 01:01:50,624
How the devil
do you wind this thing up?

710
01:01:50,916 --> 01:01:53,499
I think I'd best leave tomorrow.

711
01:01:53,708 --> 01:01:55,415
Don't talk nonsense.

712
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:59,540
Why run from something
that might not even happen?

713
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:01,582
So you do like her.

714
01:02:03,708 --> 01:02:05,415
Such is life.

715
01:02:05,583 --> 01:02:08,124
It brings some people together
and pulls others apart.

716
01:02:09,250 --> 01:02:11,040
What can we do about it?

717
01:02:15,125 --> 01:02:16,790
Don't cry, Lucia.

718
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,665
Come on, stop crying.

719
01:02:21,958 --> 01:02:23,874
What an idea!

720
01:02:24,083 --> 01:02:26,249
Where could my father
have found this?

721
01:02:37,958 --> 01:02:39,749
Ramn, wait.

722
01:02:41,541 --> 01:02:45,249
- Is there time for another trip?
- No, it's nearly 6:00.

723
01:02:45,875 --> 01:02:48,249
Finish up quickly, boys,
and let's go.

724
01:02:49,208 --> 01:02:50,957
- When are you leaving?
- Tonight.

725
01:02:51,166 --> 01:02:53,374
I'll be back tomorrow
or the next day.

726
01:02:55,375 --> 01:02:57,040
Time for the Angelus.

727
01:03:04,333 --> 01:03:06,332
The angel of the Lord
declared unto Mary.

728
01:03:07,416 --> 01:03:09,374
And she conceived
by the Holy Ghost.

729
01:03:09,583 --> 01:03:11,915
Hail Mary, full of grace.

730
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:17,290
And blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

731
01:03:17,958 --> 01:03:20,707
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners -

732
01:03:23,625 --> 01:03:25,415
Behold the handmaid of the Lord.

733
01:03:25,625 --> 01:03:27,665
Be it done unto me
according to -

734
01:03:30,375 --> 01:03:34,249
Blessed art thou among women...

735
01:03:35,625 --> 01:03:39,665
Pray for us sinners now
and at the hour of our death.

736
01:03:41,208 --> 01:03:43,124
...was made flesh.

737
01:03:43,291 --> 01:03:44,332
...among us.

738
01:03:46,375 --> 01:03:47,915
The Lord is with thee.

739
01:03:48,125 --> 01:03:51,915
Blessed art thou among women...

740
01:03:53,958 --> 01:03:57,790
Pray for us sinners...

741
01:03:59,625 --> 01:04:01,415
Pray for us,
O holy mother of God.

742
01:04:03,708 --> 01:04:07,249
...the promises
of Our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

743
01:04:24,625 --> 01:04:26,249
- Good-bye.
- Bye.

744
01:04:28,916 --> 01:04:30,207
See you tomorrow.

745
01:04:31,250 --> 01:04:33,499
Will they work
on our part of the building too?

746
01:04:33,708 --> 01:04:35,790
Don't worry.
You won't be disturbed.

747
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,832
Don't forget your meeting with the lawyer.
The car will come by in the morning.

748
01:04:40,041 --> 01:04:41,582
I'll be ready.

749
01:04:41,958 --> 01:04:45,290
- You plan to stay long in the farmyard?
- Yes. Why?

750
01:04:45,458 --> 01:04:49,832
If you'd like, you can move back
into the big house.

751
01:04:50,041 --> 01:04:52,915
Now that I'm alone,
I can stay anywhere.

752
01:04:53,750 --> 01:04:57,707
- What about your girlfriend?
- She's gone.

753
01:04:57,916 --> 01:04:59,790
Isn't she coming back?

754
01:05:01,166 --> 01:05:02,207
Why?

755
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,957
Why does a man leave a woman?

756
01:05:07,208 --> 01:05:09,624
If you don't know,
I won't explain.

757
01:05:09,833 --> 01:05:13,832
A pious woman like you with no blood
in her veins might be shocked.

758
01:05:26,458 --> 01:05:29,707
- So you still want to leave, Moncho?
- Yes, miss.

759
01:05:30,375 --> 01:05:33,249
There's nothing I can do
to make you stay?

760
01:05:33,458 --> 01:05:36,040
You don't like
my paupers, do you?

761
01:05:37,166 --> 01:05:40,707
- Where will you go?
- He'll stay with me.

762
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:45,790
If that's what you want...
but I'm sorry you're leaving.

763
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,749
Thank you
for everything, Moncho.

764
01:05:47,958 --> 01:05:49,624
God be with you.

765
01:06:04,750 --> 01:06:05,874
Of course.

766
01:06:07,875 --> 01:06:10,082
Here's the rest of the furniture.

767
01:06:11,208 --> 01:06:13,374
Look at this mess.

768
01:06:14,666 --> 01:06:16,915
Father must have been
a character.

769
01:06:17,125 --> 01:06:19,790
I don't think
he ever came up here.

770
01:06:23,166 --> 01:06:27,124
- What's in here?
- Old curtains.

771
01:06:27,333 --> 01:06:29,665
There're probably rats in here.

772
01:06:30,958 --> 01:06:32,707
Let me ask you something.

773
01:06:32,916 --> 01:06:37,499
In the seven years you worked
for my father, did he ever mention me?

774
01:06:37,708 --> 01:06:40,707
I don't remember.

775
01:06:40,916 --> 01:06:43,332
But I'm sure he loved you.

776
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:44,957
Why?

777
01:06:45,166 --> 01:06:47,832
If not, you wouldn't be here.

778
01:06:49,708 --> 01:06:51,582
These chairs aren't bad.

779
01:06:51,791 --> 01:06:55,332
With some new fabric
and a little varnish,

780
01:06:55,708 --> 01:06:57,790
they'll be fine.

781
01:06:59,041 --> 01:07:01,874
- What are those sacks doing here?
- I don't know.

782
01:07:02,083 --> 01:07:03,790
They've always been there.

783
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,499
How stupid. It's plaster.

784
01:07:06,708 --> 01:07:08,957
It's still usable.

785
01:07:09,166 --> 01:07:10,832
And these others?

786
01:07:12,791 --> 01:07:14,207
Sand.

787
01:07:14,416 --> 01:07:17,540
Tell the foreman
to get these out of here tomorrow.

788
01:07:20,125 --> 01:07:22,082
What's the matter, woman?

789
01:07:23,166 --> 01:07:25,332
Why are you staring
at me like that?

790
01:07:27,833 --> 01:07:29,499
You know, Ramona,

791
01:07:29,708 --> 01:07:32,749
if you fixed yourself up a bit,
you could even be pretty.

792
01:07:33,708 --> 01:07:35,582
Nice small teeth.

793
01:07:35,791 --> 01:07:37,582
Full lips.

794
01:07:38,208 --> 01:07:40,165
What more do you want?

795
01:07:52,625 --> 01:07:55,124
Let's sit down for a minute.

796
01:08:20,208 --> 01:08:23,582
- Shall we go?
- Don Jorge will be at the lawyer's at 4:00.

797
01:08:23,791 --> 01:08:25,165
Very well.

798
01:08:27,958 --> 01:08:32,249
I leave them in your trusted care.
See that they behave.

799
01:08:32,458 --> 01:08:35,499
Don't worry.
I'll keep them under control.

800
01:08:35,708 --> 01:08:36,957
Do you want anything?

801
01:08:37,375 --> 01:08:40,915
A flute, perhaps.
I'd like to study music.

802
01:08:41,125 --> 01:08:42,874
They're going to hurt me.

803
01:08:43,083 --> 01:08:46,040
You'll just have to bear it.
Let's go.

804
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:49,207
Have a nice trip, miss.

805
01:08:52,833 --> 01:08:54,207
Get in.

806
01:09:00,125 --> 01:09:01,165
Shut up!

807
01:09:01,666 --> 01:09:04,999
- Those brats are a nuisance.
- Should I kill them?

808
01:09:05,208 --> 01:09:08,874
- With their future -
- They'd be better off dead.

809
01:09:11,458 --> 01:09:14,665
Put her in the sun
with her sister.

810
01:09:19,041 --> 01:09:20,124
They're gone.

811
01:09:20,333 --> 01:09:23,832
Let's kill a couple of lambs
and roast them.

812
01:09:24,041 --> 01:09:28,540
- What do you say?
- All right, if it's not disrespectful.

813
01:09:28,750 --> 01:09:32,124
- What would Viridiana say?
- She'll never know.

814
01:09:32,333 --> 01:09:36,374
If you say so. But a roast
like that takes four hours.

815
01:09:36,583 --> 01:09:38,707
We're not in any hurry.

816
01:09:38,916 --> 01:09:41,374
Didn't you say
you can make custard too?

817
01:09:42,750 --> 01:09:45,582
Hear that?
Get some eggs and milk.

818
01:09:45,875 --> 01:09:48,165
I'll see to the lambs.

819
01:09:51,291 --> 01:09:53,332
Relax. We're on our own now.

820
01:09:53,541 --> 01:09:55,874
- What of it?
- Why bother to work?

821
01:09:56,083 --> 01:09:57,207
Hush!

822
01:09:59,833 --> 01:10:03,040
You're one
of those troublemakers.

823
01:10:03,250 --> 01:10:08,082
The lady left me in charge.
There'll be no fooling around.

824
01:10:08,291 --> 01:10:09,999
I'm talking to you!

825
01:10:10,208 --> 01:10:13,040
Old coot.
Who said I was making trouble?

826
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:16,207
Zequiel, Refugio, come here.

827
01:10:16,416 --> 01:10:17,957
Damned women!

828
01:10:18,166 --> 01:10:21,082
- How did you get in?
- Through a window.

829
01:10:21,291 --> 01:10:23,665
- Where are you going?
- Come on, Zequiel.

830
01:10:23,875 --> 01:10:26,874
I've been inside before.
There are some lovely things.

831
01:10:27,083 --> 01:10:32,457
If it's just to look...
but don't touch anything.

832
01:10:52,083 --> 01:10:54,707
Little dove, are you hurt?

833
01:10:55,458 --> 01:10:56,915
What's your name?

834
01:10:57,125 --> 01:10:59,957
My little dove.

835
01:11:04,625 --> 01:11:06,082
Take that!

836
01:11:06,250 --> 01:11:08,707
- Beat it!
- I'll make you a eunuch!

837
01:11:08,916 --> 01:11:13,249
I hope you all get what I've got,
you swine!

838
01:11:16,875 --> 01:11:19,999
The lady who looks
like our Miss Viridiana

839
01:11:20,208 --> 01:11:22,749
was the wife of the man
who hanged himself.

840
01:11:24,166 --> 01:11:28,540
Imagine hanging yourself
with that kind of dough.

841
01:11:28,750 --> 01:11:32,915
He must have had asthma.
These rich guys all have asthma.

842
01:11:36,791 --> 01:11:38,332
Look at this stuff!

843
01:11:38,541 --> 01:11:40,374
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

844
01:11:42,333 --> 01:11:45,707
- What a snazzy tablecloth!
- Let's spread it out.

845
01:11:48,083 --> 01:11:51,707
That must have cost
a good thousand.

846
01:11:51,916 --> 01:11:54,249
More like 10,000.

847
01:11:54,458 --> 01:11:57,999
- Can't you see it's French lace?
- Put it away now.

848
01:11:58,208 --> 01:12:00,582
Shut up and smoke.
We're doing no harm.

849
01:12:00,750 --> 01:12:02,874
You're smoking the man's tobacco,
and that's worse.

850
01:12:03,083 --> 01:12:04,540
Zequiel is right.

851
01:12:04,750 --> 01:12:08,040
If they come back and catch us,
God have mercy on us.

852
01:12:08,250 --> 01:12:11,082
The driver said
they'll be back tomorrow.

853
01:12:12,041 --> 01:12:15,499
To die without ever eating
off such wonderful linens!

854
01:12:19,750 --> 01:12:21,749
Don Zequiel, come on.

855
01:12:22,083 --> 01:12:23,332
For good luck.

856
01:12:24,083 --> 01:12:28,457
Don't worry. We'll leave everything
spic-and-span before they get back.

857
01:12:28,666 --> 01:12:30,540
Pass that over here.

858
01:12:30,750 --> 01:12:32,415
Go on with your story.

859
01:12:32,583 --> 01:12:34,832
I can't talk over all this ruckus.

860
01:12:35,041 --> 01:12:37,749
Riddle me this: What bird -

861
01:12:38,083 --> 01:12:40,249
Shut up and let him talk!

862
01:12:40,458 --> 01:12:43,499
- Tell us, Amalio.
- Silence!

863
01:12:45,833 --> 01:12:48,624
Two of us went begging

864
01:12:48,833 --> 01:12:51,457
at high-class churches.

865
01:12:52,083 --> 01:12:57,999
The girls passing by smelled so sweet
you could almost feel them.

866
01:12:58,208 --> 01:13:01,915
Figure that: You could smell them
but not touch them.

867
01:13:03,125 --> 01:13:05,040
Why did you split up?

868
01:13:05,250 --> 01:13:06,790
Shut up, you!

869
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,124
- Somebody else ask me.
- Tell me.

870
01:13:09,333 --> 01:13:14,207
'Cause the deaf fellow
started robbing offertory boxes.

871
01:13:14,416 --> 01:13:15,582
How did you know?

872
01:13:15,791 --> 01:13:20,999
I heard coins in his pockets,
and we'd received nothing that day.

873
01:13:21,208 --> 01:13:23,124
Know what I did?

874
01:13:23,541 --> 01:13:25,457
I told the police.

875
01:13:25,958 --> 01:13:28,582
Because he didn't give you a cut,

876
01:13:28,791 --> 01:13:29,915
you rat!

877
01:13:30,125 --> 01:13:34,290
The judges thanked me.
One of them even said I was -

878
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:36,124
What was the word?

879
01:13:36,333 --> 01:13:39,415
A squealer -
that's what I'd call you.

880
01:13:39,625 --> 01:13:43,874
He called me civic-spirited,
for your information.

881
01:13:46,583 --> 01:13:49,457
I threw it in the well

882
01:13:50,083 --> 01:13:53,582
The carnation you gave me

883
01:13:53,791 --> 01:13:55,374
I threw it in the well

884
01:13:55,583 --> 01:13:58,582
I don't want carnations
from any young man

885
01:14:00,458 --> 01:14:04,082
All the time I had it

886
01:14:04,291 --> 01:14:08,124
it weighed on my heart

887
01:14:09,291 --> 01:14:12,290
To your health and that
of this wonderful gathering.

888
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:14,665
Shut up, you little brat!

889
01:14:15,625 --> 01:14:19,249
You gonna shut up,
or am I gonna shut you up?

890
01:14:20,333 --> 01:14:22,249
Who do you think you are?

891
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:26,374
Why do you have
to yell like that?

892
01:14:28,791 --> 01:14:30,915
Leave my girls alone!

893
01:14:31,125 --> 01:14:32,999
We can't hear ourselves talk.

894
01:14:33,208 --> 01:14:36,999
I ought to bust your head in.

895
01:14:37,208 --> 01:14:40,832
Don't touch me
or I'll get your scabies, you pig!

896
01:14:51,458 --> 01:14:52,832
Stop it!

897
01:14:54,125 --> 01:14:55,790
Let me go!

898
01:14:56,625 --> 01:14:58,124
Calm down, Enedina!

899
01:14:58,333 --> 01:15:00,624
She's not worth bothering about.

900
01:15:00,833 --> 01:15:03,040
Let's not forget our manners!

901
01:15:04,708 --> 01:15:06,582
You stay where you were.

902
01:15:10,166 --> 01:15:11,957
My custard!

903
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:14,374
Get out of there, thief!

904
01:15:34,333 --> 01:15:38,165
I won't forget your kindness.
You'll see!

905
01:15:38,375 --> 01:15:39,749
Let me go!

906
01:15:52,708 --> 01:15:54,624
- Enedina.
- What do you want?

907
01:15:54,833 --> 01:15:56,332
Now?

908
01:15:56,541 --> 01:16:00,499
Enedina's going to take
our picture for a souvenir.

909
01:16:00,708 --> 01:16:04,165
- With what camera?
- One my parents gave me.

910
01:16:04,375 --> 01:16:06,082
Everyone over there.

911
01:16:11,208 --> 01:16:14,207
I won't take it
unless you all sit still.

912
01:16:14,416 --> 01:16:17,165
When I say "freeze,"
don't anybody move.

913
01:16:17,375 --> 01:16:18,915
Come on, hurry up.

914
01:16:22,333 --> 01:16:24,499
Amalio, tilt your hat back.

915
01:16:29,291 --> 01:16:32,582
Refugio, pull your hair back.
I can't see your face.

916
01:16:32,791 --> 01:16:36,957
Riddle me this:
What bird lays eggs in a barn?

917
01:16:37,166 --> 01:16:38,999
A chicken.

918
01:16:41,166 --> 01:16:42,790
Sit still!

919
01:16:48,666 --> 01:16:50,082
Don't move!

920
01:17:17,416 --> 01:17:20,832
Tables aren't for sleeping on.

921
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:24,207
Eat your custard.
It's really yummy.

922
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,165
You're so right, Enedina.

923
01:17:59,166 --> 01:18:00,832
Little dove of the south.

924
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:21,832
Enedina, come here, woman.

925
01:18:25,125 --> 01:18:26,665
Have a drink.

926
01:19:44,791 --> 01:19:46,665
Look at this, Enedina.

927
01:19:47,458 --> 01:19:49,165
- Down here.
- What is it?

928
01:19:52,250 --> 01:19:54,624
- What?
- You have to get closer.

929
01:19:56,333 --> 01:19:59,832
Look, Zequiel.
Isn't it shameful?

930
01:20:01,958 --> 01:20:04,790
Let me go!

931
01:20:10,750 --> 01:20:12,332
Let me go!

932
01:20:14,583 --> 01:20:16,832
Let 'em scuffle.

933
01:20:17,583 --> 01:20:20,999
They can make up
and be friends later.

934
01:20:27,416 --> 01:20:31,040
Look what they did to you,
Don Zequiel!

935
01:20:32,708 --> 01:20:34,290
- Don Amalio.
- What is it?

936
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:37,082
- Enedina and Paco.
- What about them?

937
01:20:37,291 --> 01:20:40,749
They're picking posies
behind the sofa.

938
01:20:41,875 --> 01:20:44,374
- Which sofa?
- The one over there.

939
01:20:48,458 --> 01:20:50,665
- Take me there.
- I've gone too far.

940
01:20:50,875 --> 01:20:52,540
Come on, take me.

941
01:20:53,958 --> 01:20:56,290
Where are you, you dog?

942
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:58,707
Take me there. I'll kill him!

943
01:21:11,916 --> 01:21:14,499
Now he's spoiled the party.

944
01:21:14,708 --> 01:21:16,874
How will we ever
clean up this mess?

945
01:21:17,083 --> 01:21:18,874
Holy Mother of God!

946
01:21:20,916 --> 01:21:24,374
Let's go.
There's going to be terrible trouble.

947
01:21:24,583 --> 01:21:28,082
Let's make sure we're seen
in the village tonight.

948
01:21:30,041 --> 01:21:33,540
If Amalio were my husband,
he'd be entitled. But as things are?

949
01:21:33,750 --> 01:21:36,749
You're right.
And the way he treats you!

950
01:22:14,916 --> 01:22:18,082
It's every man for himself now.
Let's go.

951
01:22:23,625 --> 01:22:27,165
Good evening.
He's feeling a bit ill.

952
01:22:34,458 --> 01:22:37,999
Good night, Don Jorge.
We were just on our way out.

953
01:22:39,541 --> 01:22:41,915
Let's get out of here.

954
01:22:46,125 --> 01:22:49,582
Weren't you supposed
to be back tomorrow?

955
01:22:49,791 --> 01:22:52,915
I didn't want to,
but they made me.

956
01:22:53,125 --> 01:22:55,332
Go on! Get out of here!

957
01:23:07,625 --> 01:23:13,665
Blessed are they who gave shelter
to a helpless blind man.

958
01:23:13,875 --> 01:23:15,665
May God reward them.

959
01:23:43,375 --> 01:23:45,415
Didn't you hear me?

960
01:23:45,625 --> 01:23:46,790
Come out.

961
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:48,582
Get out of here.

962
01:23:48,791 --> 01:23:54,165
Don't be angry, sir.
I won't hurt you.

963
01:24:00,791 --> 01:24:03,832
I got him, comrade!

964
01:24:04,625 --> 01:24:06,832
My God! What have you done?

965
01:24:07,041 --> 01:24:09,749
- He asked for it.
- But why?

966
01:24:12,791 --> 01:24:14,832
Don't cry over him.

967
01:24:15,041 --> 01:24:18,749
If you've lost one man,
another will console you.

968
01:24:19,125 --> 01:24:22,457
Jos, stop him!

969
01:24:23,625 --> 01:24:26,874
Don't worry, miss.
We're all decent folk.

970
01:24:33,208 --> 01:24:35,499
We have to alert them
in the village.

971
01:24:35,708 --> 01:24:37,749
They'll catch 'em right away.

972
01:24:37,958 --> 01:24:39,457
Get in, Rita.

973
01:24:40,875 --> 01:24:44,249
Just relax.
It's gotta happen sometime.

974
01:24:45,541 --> 01:24:48,415
Ramona, help!

975
01:25:13,958 --> 01:25:15,040
Come here!

976
01:25:16,833 --> 01:25:19,457
I might get a turn
when he's done.

977
01:25:19,666 --> 01:25:21,249
Come here!

978
01:25:24,041 --> 01:25:26,790
Help me and you'll be
a rich man.

979
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,332
Me, a rich man? Come on now.

980
01:25:29,541 --> 01:25:34,249
- There's lots of money in the house.
- Where?

981
01:25:34,458 --> 01:25:38,332
You needn't untie me
if you're afraid.

982
01:25:38,541 --> 01:25:40,790
Just kill him
and the money's yours.

983
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,249
- Where is it?
- Kill him and I'll tell you.

984
01:25:43,458 --> 01:25:45,415
It's thousands of pesetas.

985
01:25:45,625 --> 01:25:47,332
Kill him, you idiot!

986
01:25:59,958 --> 01:26:00,999
Kill him!

987
01:26:02,833 --> 01:26:05,624
That'll teach you to bully me!

988
01:26:07,833 --> 01:26:09,749
Where's the money?

989
01:26:09,958 --> 01:26:11,874
In this cabinet.

990
01:26:12,083 --> 01:26:13,540
It's not locked.

991
01:26:21,833 --> 01:26:23,499
The top shelf.

992
01:26:25,583 --> 01:26:27,124
Under the linen.

993
01:26:35,250 --> 01:26:36,582
Up there.

994
01:26:39,750 --> 01:26:41,124
Let's go.

995
01:27:10,916 --> 01:27:16,124
I want a switch here
and a socket down there.

996
01:27:25,958 --> 01:27:28,624
Are you over the shock?

997
01:27:35,708 --> 01:27:39,332
And another socket here
for two floor lamps.

998
01:28:38,625 --> 01:28:40,165
Where are the towels?

999
01:29:17,583 --> 01:29:20,707
Who could that be?
Where are you going? Wait.

1000
01:29:23,333 --> 01:29:25,040
Come in.

1001
01:29:32,083 --> 01:29:33,707
Is something wrong?

1002
01:29:34,375 --> 01:29:37,499
You want to speak to me?
What can I do for you?

1003
01:29:43,208 --> 01:29:44,332
Come in.

1004
01:29:52,041 --> 01:29:55,332
I must say
I wasn't expecting you.

1005
01:29:56,375 --> 01:29:57,957
We were playing cards.

1006
01:29:59,958 --> 01:30:01,790
Don't be surprised.

1007
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:05,207
You have to find some way
to pass the long evenings here.

1008
01:30:05,416 --> 01:30:06,790
Have a seat.

1009
01:30:08,916 --> 01:30:10,957
Don't go, Ramona. Come.

1010
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:15,707
The lady won't mind if you stay.
She isn't proud.

1011
01:30:16,708 --> 01:30:18,874
You know how to play?

1012
01:30:20,375 --> 01:30:21,707
Sit down.

1013
01:30:22,875 --> 01:30:24,915
I'm sure you'll enjoy it.

1014
01:30:25,458 --> 01:30:28,165
You sit down too.

1015
01:30:29,666 --> 01:30:31,832
All cats are gray by night.

1016
01:30:32,041 --> 01:30:35,207
You like this popular music,
Viridiana?

1017
01:30:37,916 --> 01:30:39,540
Cut the cards.

1018
01:30:39,750 --> 01:30:41,290
Like this.

1019
01:30:45,708 --> 01:30:49,332
You know,
the first time I saw you, I thought,

1020
01:30:49,541 --> 01:30:53,374
"My cousin and I will end up
shuffling the deck together."
