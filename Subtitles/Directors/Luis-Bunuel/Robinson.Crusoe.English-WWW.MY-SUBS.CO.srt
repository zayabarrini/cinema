00:01:38,627 --> 00:01:43,026
<i>Being the third son of a good family
and not educated to any trade...</i>

3
00:01:43,215 --> 00:01:47,315
<i>my head began to be filled early with
thoughts of leaving England to see the world.</i>

4
00:01:47,642 --> 00:01:53,229
<i>And thus against the will, nay the commands
of my father, I broke loose and went to sea.</i>

5
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,092
<i>How true my father's prophecy of disaster.</i>

6
00:02:03,642 --> 00:02:07,691
<i>For not long after, being in the
latitude of 12 degrees, 18 minutes...</i>

7
00:02:07,934 --> 00:02:11,772
<i>bound for Africa to buy Negro slaves
for my fellow planters in the Brazils...</i>

8
00:02:12,047 --> 00:02:15,319
<i>a violent tornado came
upon us which carried us westward.</i>

9
00:02:15,707 --> 00:02:18,460
<i>Far out of the way of all human commerce.</i>

10
00:04:44,353 --> 00:04:48,703
<i>My only possession, my only weapon.</i>

11
00:05:47,267 --> 00:05:51,715
<i>I woke refreshed
and half perished with hunger.</i>

12
00:06:37,677 --> 00:06:44,447
<i>Thirsty, without provisions, with little hope
of survival, I set out to survey my fate.</i>

13
00:06:46,227 --> 00:06:52,306
<i>No other land in sight, I was on
an island and barren by the sea.</i>

14
00:07:36,341 --> 00:07:41,135
<i>The wreck of our ship,
stranded during the night.</i>

15
00:10:35,026 --> 00:10:36,032
Sam.

16
00:10:46,914 --> 00:10:52,063
<i>She might slip from the rock, I must contrive
a raft and try to save her precious supplies.</i>

17
00:10:55,735 --> 00:10:57,185
<i>I plundered from the wreck...</i>

18
00:10:57,207 --> 00:11:02,787
<i>many chests with all manner of clothes,
tallow, gunpowder, the carpenter tools...</i>

19
00:11:02,817 --> 00:11:08,338
<i>and scores of other must useful articles,
not to forget that fellow survivor, Sam.</i>

20
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:41,421
<i>Gold, yet, what use to me.</i>

21
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:50,112
<i>However, on second thoughts.</i>

22
00:12:15,294 --> 00:12:19,610
<i>Tinder, steel, flint...</i>

23
00:12:20,177 --> 00:12:25,363
<i>fire, fire, worth more to me
than all the gold in the world.</i>

24
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:38,491
<i>How often I'd seen my servants do this.</i>

25
00:12:38,521 --> 00:12:42,523
<i>Yet I, a master of servants,
couldn't even build my own fire</i>

26
00:13:22,874 --> 00:13:26,501
Rex. Ah, Rex.

27
00:13:27,757 --> 00:13:29,925
You're alive, you're alive too.

28
00:13:33,261 --> 00:13:34,261
Rex.

29
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,451
What was that Rex?

30
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,500
What is it?

31
00:14:05,114 --> 00:14:10,119
<i>She was gone, that fearful sound
had been the death cry of our poor ship.</i>

32
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:14,071
<i>I regretted all iron work, cables
and lead that had gone down with her.</i>

33
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:23,333
<i>Rats, the only things from
the ship I did not want ashore.</i>

34
00:14:54,472 --> 00:14:56,610
<i>No ship will sail by without my knowledge.</i>

35
00:14:57,225 --> 00:15:00,431
<i>I kept dry branches ready
to flame into a mighty beacon.</i>

36
00:15:08,223 --> 00:15:13,502
<i>Most urgent of all was to secure myself
against both wild beasts and savages.</i>

37
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:27,688
<i>Meanwhile the rains approached and
needing store room for all my supplies...</i>

38
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:31,518
<i>I found a place where the earth was
easiest and started to dig up a cave.</i>

39
00:15:31,841 --> 00:15:36,295
<i>As I had never before so much as handled
an ax or for that matter any kind of tool...</i>

40
00:15:36,505 --> 00:15:40,797
<i>I was but a very sorry workman
and all this cost me a great deal of time.</i>

41
00:16:21,536 --> 00:16:24,924
<i>I became a possibly good
shot and with good cause...</i>

42
00:16:24,954 --> 00:16:29,863
<i>for my constant hard manual labor
gave me a most voracious appetite.</i>

43
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:39,001
<i>The green coconut and its milk I found to
be most wholesome, cool and refreshing.</i>

44
00:16:41,752 --> 00:16:44,325
<i>My eleventh month.</i>

45
00:16:44,355 --> 00:16:48,461
<i>Days passed in
hunting wild foul, preparing food...</i>

46
00:16:48,491 --> 00:16:51,954
<i>trips to my lookout
hill to search for sight of ships.</i>

47
00:16:51,984 --> 00:16:57,974
<i>One day much like another, uneventful and...</i>

48
00:16:58,387 --> 00:17:01,144
<i>I am sick...</i>

49
00:17:02,017 --> 00:17:06,889
<i>chills, fever, getting worse.</i>

50
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:52,842
<i>Help, help me.</i>

51
00:18:35,211 --> 00:18:40,311
<i>In this second sleep
I had this terrible dream.</i>

52
00:18:42,241 --> 00:18:44,493
You here, father?

53
00:18:47,158 --> 00:18:51,642
Yes, here, here, here, here, here, here.

54
00:18:53,777 --> 00:18:56,228
Not there, but here.

55
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:00,656
Where else would I be? Are you not here?

56
00:19:03,499 --> 00:19:04,889
Why do you get here?

57
00:19:05,918 --> 00:19:09,731
My boy, you should not
leave your native country.

58
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:16,745
At my house, with your dear mother and me,
you had the very best of all possible worlds.

59
00:19:20,505 --> 00:19:24,577
Yes, yes, I remember all you told me, a lot.

60
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:29,599
- Give me water.
- At home you are well off...

61
00:19:30,112 --> 00:19:35,252
and saved the miseries of labor
and hardships of mankind's lower state.

62
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:39,681
Though yet embarrassed by the pride, envy...

63
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:43,397
luxury and ambition of its upper state.

64
00:19:45,453 --> 00:19:48,498
Water father, give me water.

65
00:19:48,933 --> 00:19:51,983
Ours is the middle station
of life my boy, the middle station.

66
00:19:52,007 --> 00:19:56,208
Even kings would've envied you,
admit that now, you admit it?

67
00:20:01,683 --> 00:20:05,381
Will you not help me? I want water.

68
00:20:06,606 --> 00:20:09,910
Why did you ling
yourself into this stupid adventure?

69
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:14,927
Did you not know that
your mother and I were praying that...

70
00:20:14,928 --> 00:20:17,099
God would not separate us from you?

71
00:20:17,888 --> 00:20:18,888
And...

72
00:20:21,515 --> 00:20:26,860
- you were always wayward.
- Water, bring me water.

73
00:20:30,149 --> 00:20:34,356
Your mother and I
will forgive you, but remember...

74
00:20:35,084 --> 00:20:39,037
God, will not forgive you.

75
00:21:02,792 --> 00:21:08,390
He will not forgive you.
You will die like a dog, you will die.

76
00:21:09,276 --> 00:21:15,254
I will die I will die.

77
00:21:33,315 --> 00:21:35,434
<i>I woke weak, yet clear of head.</i>

78
00:21:35,845 --> 00:21:39,578
<i>Whether I had slept for one whole
day or more I could never be certain.</i>

79
00:21:40,242 --> 00:21:42,677
<i>My first thought was for water.</i>

80
00:22:21,677 --> 00:22:25,757
<i>Did not the Brazilians have some
physic to prevent recurrence of fevers?</i>

81
00:23:18,954 --> 00:23:23,254
<i>In that chest I found
a cure for both, body and soul.</i>

82
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:37,708
Come to me in the day
of trouble and I will deliver thee.

83
00:23:38,689 --> 00:23:41,315
And thou shall glorify me.

84
00:23:42,706 --> 00:23:48,147
Yes, it's true.
Only He can deliver me out of this place.

85
00:24:02,255 --> 00:24:07,822
<i>I now respect to the Sabbath and so,
mark that day differently from all others.</i>

86
00:24:26,959 --> 00:24:29,268
The last of it Rex.

87
00:24:30,185 --> 00:24:33,602
Now I've been denied the staff of life.

88
00:24:48,627 --> 00:24:52,295
<i>I recalled a grass I had
observed to sprout and start to grow.</i>

89
00:24:52,738 --> 00:24:58,242
<i>Grain, that which in England we call
corn and in the new world they call wheat.</i>

90
00:24:58,812 --> 00:25:02,133
<i>Some few seeds must've
come ashore with me from the ship.</i>

91
00:25:02,893 --> 00:25:06,246
<i>With the Lord's help,
I could try to raise a crop.</i>

92
00:25:08,143 --> 00:25:12,002
<i>Meanwhile I set out to make a
more perfect discover of my domain.</i>

93
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:27,405
<i>I found great amounts of coco, orange and
lemon trees, sugar cane, tobacco and banana.</i>

94
00:25:32,588 --> 00:25:36,038
<i>I discovered the turtle, which
furnishes an abundance of savory flesh.</i>

95
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:38,856
<i>Great quantities of most useful shell.</i>

96
00:25:44,897 --> 00:25:47,048
<i>And even turtle eggs.</i>

97
00:25:49,832 --> 00:25:52,521
<i>Also that other sea beast, the octopus...</i>

98
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:55,747
<i>which they say some
people lack the fortitude to eat.</i>

99
00:25:57,298 --> 00:26:00,302
<i>Parrots, which were known to me.</i>

100
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:06,047
<i>And other birds, which were foreign.</i>

101
00:26:08,018 --> 00:26:10,549
<i>Animals I did not recognize,</i>

102
00:26:13,179 --> 00:26:15,684
<i>And those I did, goats</i>

103
00:26:24,952 --> 00:26:26,788
<i>goats.</i>

104
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:02,781
<i>It was a most unusual clear day.</i>

105
00:27:04,315 --> 00:27:08,305
<i>Land, could I not
hack out a canoe, sail to it?</i>

106
00:27:18,542 --> 00:27:23,010
<i>I hewed out a tiny sailing canoe,
was swept out to sea by some great current.</i>

107
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:29,042
<i>Thanks only a sudden Gail wind,
was I even fortunate to get back to shore.</i>

108
00:27:31,705 --> 00:27:33,902
<i>In other ventures I was more successful.</i>

109
00:28:01,634 --> 00:28:04,776
Come Rex, here Rex, come here Rex, come.

110
00:28:21,393 --> 00:28:25,716
Tell me only this, where did you
find their father? Do you know?

111
00:28:33,425 --> 00:28:36,211
<i>The one mystery of the island I never solved.</i>

112
00:28:37,344 --> 00:28:42,268
<i>Due to sowing during dry season,
first half of seed complete loss.</i>

113
00:28:50,139 --> 00:28:52,839
<i>It's just as it may
seem the best would come to pass...</i>

114
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,817
<i>and that I might finally
triumph over the sun, the rain...</i>

115
00:28:56,222 --> 00:28:59,284
<i>I was threatened by a new enemy, the birds.</i>

116
00:28:59,314 --> 00:29:04,167
<i>They came down on my field
like a plague, a ruthless devouring army.</i>

117
00:29:07,785 --> 00:29:13,326
<i>I fought for wheat as though it'll my life,
used every weapon to frighten and kill.</i>

118
00:30:30,402 --> 00:30:31,869
Hungry Rex?

119
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:40,903
You can wave your
tail, but you cannot talk to me.

120
00:30:56,514 --> 00:31:01,220
<i>Five years, the fifth
anniversary of the day I landed.</i>

121
00:31:04,661 --> 00:31:06,306
Time to celebrate.

122
00:31:09,163 --> 00:31:13,364
♪ I care not I or
nobody and nobody cares or me. ♪

123
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:25,830
Do you or do you not? You don't, I do.

124
00:31:27,805 --> 00:31:28,805
I did.

125
00:31:29,956 --> 00:31:33,149
This is a day, a day...

126
00:31:34,137 --> 00:31:35,999
What a day this is?

127
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:42,152
I have nothing further to say.

128
00:31:56,645 --> 00:32:00,969
My friends, my old friends.

129
00:32:03,123 --> 00:32:07,074
I care for nobody and nobody cares or me.

130
00:32:17,731 --> 00:32:20,192
I remember you all.

131
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:28,515
- Hooray for friendship.
- Hooray.

132
00:32:29,421 --> 00:32:34,587
Hip Hip Hooray. Hip Hip Hooray.

133
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:38,668
And here the lowly Keg is dead.

134
00:32:38,846 --> 00:32:43,818
They'll keep us together,
stuck, one to another...

135
00:32:44,725 --> 00:32:46,458
until the resurrection.

136
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:58,456
Tom, you're at,
Morton, for you and for you Campbell.

137
00:33:44,257 --> 00:33:47,120
<i>At last, a full harvest.</i>

138
00:33:53,892 --> 00:33:57,550
<i>Now it could be truly said,
I worked for my bread.</i>

139
00:34:33,534 --> 00:34:39,202
Have a cake, have a cake,
bake me a cake as fast as you can.

140
00:34:46,976 --> 00:34:48,595
Be patient Rex.

141
00:34:55,915 --> 00:34:57,793
Sing for your supper Poll.

142
00:35:15,526 --> 00:35:18,237
<i>Coarse, burnt...</i>

143
00:35:18,609 --> 00:35:21,637
<i>and most delicious meal of my life.</i>

144
00:35:24,147 --> 00:35:29,022
<i>I built a bower, so that I fancied
now, I was Lord of the whole manor.</i>

145
00:35:29,052 --> 00:35:32,099
<i>And had my country house
and my seacoast house too.</i>

146
00:35:32,472 --> 00:35:36,018
<i>I perfected myself in all tasks
and was forced to learn new ones.</i>

147
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:40,520
<i>In short, I learned to master
everything in my island...</i>

148
00:35:41,589 --> 00:35:43,549
<i>except myself.</i>

149
00:35:44,813 --> 00:35:47,566
<i>Sometimes in the midst of my work...</i>

150
00:35:47,744 --> 00:35:52,797
<i>the anguish of my soul and my loneliness
would break out upon me like a storm.</i>

151
00:35:53,866 --> 00:35:54,999
<i>Escape.</i>

152
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:59,712
<i>No matter the dangers I must
do something to escape this tomb...</i>

153
00:36:01,007 --> 00:36:03,290
<i>this prison.</i>

154
00:36:05,298 --> 00:36:10,092
<i>My heart died within me. Alone.</i>

155
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:12,764
<i>Alone.</i>

156
00:36:14,595 --> 00:36:15,987
<i>Forever alone.</i>

157
00:36:17,785 --> 00:36:23,728
<i>I was a prisoner, locked up by the
eternal bars and bolts of the ocean.</i>

158
00:36:42,335 --> 00:36:47,857
<i>Days became weeks, weeks
became months, months became years.</i>

159
00:36:51,193 --> 00:36:55,582
<i>I quite gave up looking to see for
ships, in time my linen clothes rotted,</i>

160
00:36:55,612 --> 00:37:00,197
<i>my cats all ran wild, my
faithful dog weaken by age...</i>

161
00:37:00,423 --> 00:37:03,322
<i>could no longer keep up
with the hunt he so dearly loved.</i>

162
00:37:03,711 --> 00:37:06,318
Rex, Rex.

163
00:37:09,038 --> 00:37:12,520
Whats wrong? Rex...

164
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:53,200
Come on boy, eat Rex, eat.

165
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,229
Poor Rex, poor boy.

166
00:38:06,593 --> 00:38:10,528
Would you like a tasty?
A dove? A pigeons egg, eh?

167
00:38:14,674 --> 00:38:16,197
Now you just wait there or me.

168
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:43,484
<i>Now truly alone.</i>

169
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:47,452
<i>Starved for the sound
of another voice, any voice.</i>

170
00:39:47,695 --> 00:39:49,638
<i>I would rush to my valley of the echo.</i>

171
00:40:00,495 --> 00:40:06,600
The Lord is my shepherd.

172
00:40:10,902 --> 00:40:13,148
I shalt not want,

173
00:40:16,153 --> 00:40:20,929
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.

174
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:31,019
He leadeth me besides still waters.

175
00:40:32,095 --> 00:40:37,630
He restoreth my soul.

176
00:40:40,856 --> 00:40:44,494
My soul.

177
00:40:54,742 --> 00:41:00,404
<i>Dreadful fantasies possess
my mind, I fought to save my sanity.</i>

178
00:41:09,829 --> 00:41:19,413
Lay down in green pastures, he leadeth me
besides still waters, he restoreth my soul.

179
00:41:23,684 --> 00:41:29,600
Green pastures, green pastures.

180
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:33,268
<i>The scriptures came meaningless to my eyes.</i>

181
00:41:33,622 --> 00:41:39,128
<i>The world seemed but a whirling ball,
it's oceans and continents a green scum,</i>

182
00:41:40,177 --> 00:41:45,824
<i>And myself, but no purpose and no meaning.</i>

183
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,975
Help, help.

184
00:41:57,742 --> 00:42:01,628
Help, help.

185
00:42:46,336 --> 00:42:50,834
<i>Had anyone in England met such an odd
creature as I was in my 18 year of solitude.</i>

186
00:42:51,028 --> 00:42:55,459
<i>It must either have frightened them
or cause a great deal of laughter.</i>

187
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,947
Ah, my little friends.

188
00:43:04,955 --> 00:43:06,160
Yes.

189
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:10,740
I don't know what to call you but
you are my little friends, aren't you?

190
00:43:10,741 --> 00:43:11,741
Eh?

191
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:17,650
Ah, just you wait there in your
homes and I will feed you.

192
00:43:19,869 --> 00:43:22,262
You're hungry too, aren't you? Yeah.

193
00:43:22,871 --> 00:43:23,871
Yes.

194
00:43:24,624 --> 00:43:27,924
Here's a morsel for you, eh?

195
00:43:29,232 --> 00:43:30,232
There.

196
00:43:31,564 --> 00:43:34,518
Go on, get him, get him, get him.

197
00:43:44,649 --> 00:43:46,838
Well, good bye.

198
00:43:50,259 --> 00:43:51,581
Good bye.

199
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:23,576
<i>Condemned to all those years of loneliness...</i>

200
00:45:23,799 --> 00:45:27,453
<i>now trembling in the very
apprehension of seeing another human.</i>

201
00:45:28,438 --> 00:45:31,767
<i>How mad men are possessed by fear.</i>

202
00:45:33,365 --> 00:45:37,187
<i>I even scattered my 10 cattle
so it won't betray my presence.</i>

203
00:45:53,812 --> 00:45:55,885
Hello Robin, hello.

204
00:46:25,698 --> 00:46:27,382
<i>Men eaters.</i>

205
00:46:28,419 --> 00:46:32,208
<i>From that very land I
had once thought to sail to.</i>

206
00:46:34,831 --> 00:46:37,714
<i>I bolted horrified.</i>

207
00:46:38,702 --> 00:46:43,123
<i>All that night I observed the
cannibals at their ghastly entertainment.</i>

208
00:46:57,170 --> 00:47:01,778
<i>They left on the morning tide, but
how soon a tide would bring them back?</i>

209
00:47:04,839 --> 00:47:10,037
<i>How many times have they come and gone while
I unknowing was on my side of the island?</i>

210
00:47:46,135 --> 00:47:48,054
<i>I was in a murdering humor,</i>

211
00:47:48,137 --> 00:47:51,170
<i>I even thought to lure them
into my castle and from ambush...</i>

212
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:56,757
<i>slaughter 20 or 30 of the naked wretches.
I knew no peace for months and months.</i>

213
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:12,513
<i>A 100 times I was just
about to let fly at them in my sleep.</i>

214
00:48:17,375 --> 00:48:20,692
<i>I contrived what I called my bomb.</i>

215
00:48:38,359 --> 00:48:41,549
<i>Now I had my bomb, I had a vision.</i>

216
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:48,091
<i>I imagined how easy I might set a trap
and these monsters might be destroyed.</i>>

217
00:49:02,472 --> 00:49:04,383
<i>After passion, hatred.</i>

218
00:49:04,923 --> 00:49:09,664
<i>I realized I had no heaven sent right
to be judge and executor on these people...</i>

219
00:49:09,694 --> 00:49:11,379
<i>who had done me no injury.</i>

220
00:49:11,962 --> 00:49:14,116
<i>I would leave them to God's justice.</i>

221
00:49:14,683 --> 00:49:18,958
<i>I would not interfere
with them unless they attack me first.</i>

222
00:49:26,958 --> 00:49:29,658
<i>I moved about my
island with the greatest of caution...</i>

223
00:49:29,791 --> 00:49:31,941
<i>never knowing when their attack might come.</i>

224
00:50:42,730 --> 00:50:44,139
<i>They had 2 victims.</i>

225
00:50:45,678 --> 00:50:50,601
<i>While they strung one up for slaughter, I
saw that the second tried to make his escape.</i>

226
00:52:03,312 --> 00:52:09,336
Here, here. No, no, no, no. Here, here, here.

227
00:52:46,081 --> 00:52:47,878
Up, up, up now.

Out of sight, come on.

232
00:54:04,606 --> 00:54:05,772
Him, him.

233
00:54:08,266 --> 00:54:09,400
Him.

234
00:54:11,149 --> 00:54:12,979
Him, under.

235
00:55:31,770 --> 00:55:35,375
You, up, up, up, up.

00:55:43,789 --> 00:55:45,990
You name? Name.

Come here, come here, come here.

240
00:56:17,887 --> 00:56:20,323
You Friday,

241
00:56:21,588 --> 00:56:24,814
You Friday, Friday,

242
00:56:26,458 --> 00:56:29,716
- Fraday.
- No, Friday,

243
00:56:30,317 --> 00:56:31,962
Fraday.

244
00:56:34,714 --> 00:56:37,655
Master, Master.

245
00:56:38,826 --> 00:56:40,344
Master.

246
00:56:41,767 --> 00:56:45,626
Friday, Master, friends.

- Friends.

248
00:56:52,522 --> 00:56:56,887
Eat. Eat.

249
00:57:04,067 --> 00:57:10,140
No, no eat man, wrong, wrong.
Friday, this good, eat.

250
00:57:33,279 --> 00:57:39,194
<i>I dare not sleep, if the cannibals fail to
come for me before morning, he might.</i>

251
00:57:44,223 --> 00:57:45,678
<i>The cannibals had departed.</i>

252
00:57:45,708 --> 00:57:50,771
<i>Fortunately for me, without so much
as a search for their missing companions.</i>

253
00:57:56,938 --> 00:57:58,994
<i>I would not let him handle any weapon.</i>

254
00:58:11,489 --> 00:58:15,474
<i>I used my musket to ensure
his continued fear and respect of me.</i>

255
00:58:42,707 --> 00:58:47,167
<i>I put a strong door to my cave
so he could not take me unaware at night.</i>

256
00:58:52,987 --> 00:58:56,213
<i>How reassuring it was to
see him eat the flesh of animals...</i>

257
00:58:56,243 --> 00:59:01,970
<i>knowing the only source for that other
meat he so relished would be myself.</i>

258
00:59:12,313 --> 00:59:14,085
Master...

259
00:59:18,924 --> 00:59:23,005
Someday if you are
good, I'll teach you to smoke.

260
00:59:44,292 --> 00:59:49,005
<i>How pleasant it was,
once more to have a servant.</i>

261
00:59:50,397 --> 00:59:52,485
- Friday, what is this?
- Milk.

262
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:55,142
- And this?
- Bread.

263
00:59:55,490 --> 00:59:57,103
No, no Friday, use the fork.

264
01:00:01,405 --> 01:00:03,714
- Friday, what's this?
- Plate.

265
01:00:06,813 --> 01:00:08,300
- This Friday?
- Meat.

266
01:00:08,330 --> 01:00:10,033
Good Friday, very good.

267
01:00:25,945 --> 01:00:30,384
- What you see?
- Inside, black line.

268
01:00:30,675 --> 01:00:33,946
- Is your land, your nation.
- Inside?

269
01:00:34,303 --> 01:00:36,279
No, there.

270
01:00:37,105 --> 01:00:38,903
Though this, it appear near.

271
01:00:40,263 --> 01:00:43,453
There is your nation, your people.

272
01:00:43,858 --> 01:00:47,146
Oh happy, there see my nation, my people.

273
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:51,357
Why do you always come here, to this island?

274
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:55,341
God says, only good place after kill here.

275
01:00:56,847 --> 01:00:59,097
And you would like to go back to your nation?

276
01:00:59,098 --> 01:01:01,624
Yes. Oh yes, like go back Friday.

277
01:01:01,851 --> 01:01:06,401
- Friday happy there see my people.
- I understand,

278
01:01:15,082 --> 01:01:18,353
<i>Suppose a whole lot of his
countrymen were to visit the island.</i>

279
01:01:20,005 --> 01:01:22,580
<i>Would he not, forgetting
all obligation to me.</i>

280
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:25,639
<i>Either return
with them to his native country...</i>

281
01:01:25,669 --> 01:01:29,850
<i>or worse still, lead them to
plunder my precious possessions.</i>

282
01:01:30,677 --> 01:01:34,822
<i>And even join in a feast upon myself.</i>

283
01:02:30,439 --> 01:02:31,702
Friday.

284
01:02:32,962 --> 01:02:34,912
Why are you here Friday, what you want?

285
01:02:38,698 --> 01:02:42,390
Smoke, good for Master, good for Friday,

286
01:02:45,391 --> 01:02:46,391
Go.

287
01:02:46,584 --> 01:02:48,770
I you want something again, ask me first.

288
01:03:01,888 --> 01:03:05,046
<i>Had he truly remembered my
promise that he might smoke?</i>

289
01:03:14,908 --> 01:03:15,929
<i>No...</i>

290
01:03:17,224 --> 01:03:19,524
<i>I could not trust him through another night.</i>

291
01:03:21,888 --> 01:03:25,062
- Go to bed now.
- Not finished work.

292
01:03:26,163 --> 01:03:28,657
Do you hear me, go to bed.

293
01:03:46,785 --> 01:03:52,253
<i>So long ago, I had intended these for slaves.</i>

294
01:04:05,225 --> 01:04:06,225
Sit up.

295
01:04:07,217 --> 01:04:10,083
Give me your ankles, the legs.

296
01:04:12,236 --> 01:04:13,645
Why you tie Friday?

297
01:04:13,675 --> 01:04:16,301
I am your Master, I shall do as pleases me.

298
01:04:16,868 --> 01:04:21,095
You force me to this,
now at least I can sleep.

299
01:05:11,768 --> 01:05:15,234
- Take of quickly, Friday foot hurts.
- You had decided.

300
01:05:15,752 --> 01:05:19,902
Did you not tell me the other day you wanted
to go away, go back to your own nation?

301
01:05:20,076 --> 01:05:22,226
- That you want to go to your people.
- Yes.

302
01:05:22,457 --> 01:05:24,854
Go with you, only with you.

303
01:05:25,988 --> 01:05:30,545
- They'd kill me.
- I tell you save life, you friend.

304
01:05:31,759 --> 01:05:33,609
- They'd still kill me.
- No, no kill.

305
01:05:33,610 --> 01:05:39,052
My people obey Friday,
Friday love Master always.

306
01:05:51,176 --> 01:05:54,997
Friday, sit down.

307
01:06:02,868 --> 01:06:04,989
I cannot hold you here by choice.

308
01:06:06,171 --> 01:06:10,268
Perhaps it will be better if you go back.

309
01:06:12,990 --> 01:06:15,921
You beg, kill Friday.

310
01:06:17,427 --> 01:06:19,645
- What must I kill you for?
- Take.

311
01:06:19,823 --> 01:06:22,997
Kill Friday, no send Friday away.

312
01:06:35,633 --> 01:06:39,163
Friday, Friday...

313
01:06:40,281 --> 01:06:42,014
Forgive me, Friday forgive me.

314
01:06:43,712 --> 01:06:48,265
I want you to be my
friend, I will never leave you.

315
01:06:49,269 --> 01:06:53,204
If you want to go, do so.

316
01:07:13,659 --> 01:07:16,687
Friday, over there, wild pig..

317
01:07:32,056 --> 01:07:36,461
<i>How wrong I had been, Friday was as
loyal a friend as any man could want.</i>

318
01:07:41,271 --> 01:07:44,996
<i>With his many different skills
he enriched my life on the island.</i>

319
01:07:45,547 --> 01:07:50,324
<i>We found that two working together could
do far more than two working separately.</i>

320
01:08:29,342 --> 01:08:34,799
Friday, you like? You know what it is?

321
01:08:35,138 --> 01:08:38,458
Beautiful, beautiful present from god.

322
01:08:38,945 --> 01:08:44,111
Better say from the devil, eh?
No, no you would not understand Friday.

323
01:08:44,807 --> 01:08:49,036
Will Master give Friday 1, 2, 3?

324
01:08:49,066 --> 01:08:51,317
You take them all, amuse yourself.

325
01:08:51,690 --> 01:08:54,443
I you get tired of them,
throw them into the sea.

326
01:09:09,115 --> 01:09:12,468
Master, look at Friday.

327
01:09:12,825 --> 01:09:16,922
Beautiful clothe for war.

328
01:09:22,023 --> 01:09:23,076
Take that of.

329
01:09:40,127 --> 01:09:43,377
<i>These were the happiest years
of all the life I made in my island.</i>

330
01:09:57,764 --> 01:09:59,011
Sit down Friday.

331
01:10:11,999 --> 01:10:13,408
You understand Friday?

332
01:10:15,496 --> 01:10:17,828
Devil is Gods enemy in the hearts of men.

333
01:10:18,201 --> 01:10:22,768
He uses all his malice and skill
to destroy the kingdom of Christ.

334
01:10:24,850 --> 01:10:28,370
But Master say god is so strong, so great.

335
01:10:28,775 --> 01:10:34,039
- Is he not much more strong than devil?
- Yes, yes god is stronger than the devil.

336
01:10:34,799 --> 01:10:38,071
He's above the
devil, therefore we pray to God.

337
01:10:38,669 --> 01:10:41,972
But if god is much more strong as devil...

338
01:10:42,215 --> 01:10:46,053
why God no kill devil
so make him no more wicked?

339
01:10:48,441 --> 01:10:49,841
What's it Friday? What's it?

340
01:10:50,353 --> 01:10:56,134
If God the most strong,
why he not kill devil? Kill him.

341
01:10:59,098 --> 01:11:01,041
Well you see Friday...

342
01:11:01,845 --> 01:11:05,008
without the devil there
be no temptation and no sin.

343
01:11:05,898 --> 01:11:10,773
The devil must be there for us to
have a chance to choose sin or resist it.

344
01:11:11,518 --> 01:11:14,481
Is God let devil tempt us?

345
01:11:17,277 --> 01:11:21,380
- Oh, yes.
- Then, why God mad when we sin?

346
01:11:33,127 --> 01:11:37,072
You understand, don't you Poll?
Friday cant get these things into his head.

347
01:11:37,102 --> 01:11:38,789
You understand, don't you, eh?

348
01:11:54,037 --> 01:11:56,628
<i>28 years on the island.</i>

349
01:11:58,694 --> 01:12:01,390
<i>The desire to escape still burns within me.</i>

350
01:12:11,414 --> 01:12:14,005
<i>And now counting on
Friday's skill and knowledge...</i>

351
01:12:14,035 --> 01:12:16,235
<i>I contemplated the manufacture of a craft...</i>

352
01:12:16,236 --> 01:12:20,789
<i>large enough to carry us to Spanish country
which Friday told me lay to the north.</i>

353
01:12:21,501 --> 01:12:23,850
<i>We devoted weeks to selecting a proper tree.</i>

354
01:12:24,352 --> 01:12:28,757
<i>This would be my last chance to
see my native England before I died.</i>

355
01:13:27,835 --> 01:13:29,762
- Where did he come from, eh?
- There.

356
01:13:33,212 --> 01:13:35,362
Take it out of sight, there must be others.

357
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:43,483
- Master...
- Look.

358
01:15:47,159 --> 01:15:48,276
Come on.

359
01:15:56,309 --> 01:15:58,107
Now, rehearsal for the last time.

360
01:15:59,224 --> 01:16:01,701
There they are, here we are behind the trees.

361
01:16:01,912 --> 01:16:03,272
Now, well see.

362
01:16:05,443 --> 01:16:06,787
- Boom.
- Boom.

363
01:16:09,379 --> 01:16:10,950
- Boom.
- Boom.

364
01:16:13,395 --> 01:16:15,388
No, no, no, tinder, tinder.

365
01:17:07,854 --> 01:17:11,271
White man like Master, friends?

366
01:17:13,717 --> 01:17:14,948
Come on.

367
01:17:18,138 --> 01:17:19,563
Move now.

368
01:17:31,271 --> 01:17:36,535
Tie them to those trees, will come back
for you when we've got water for the ship.

369
01:17:37,247 --> 01:17:43,515
- White men eat prisoners too?
- Eat them, no Friday.

370
01:17:44,050 --> 01:17:47,094
- But murder them, yes.
- Move now.

371
01:18:52,906 --> 01:18:54,687
Rope Master, the rope.

372
01:19:04,161 --> 01:19:07,331
In spite of my appearance
I'm not something that lives in trees,

373
01:19:08,890 --> 01:19:09,911
I'm a man.

374
01:19:15,465 --> 01:19:16,615
Captain Oberzo.

375
01:19:25,927 --> 01:19:28,486
- Now we can talk.
- But to whom do I speak?

376
01:19:29,409 --> 01:19:33,668
- Who are you? Where have you come from?
- What is your case? Tell me.

377
01:19:34,753 --> 01:19:39,886
Mutiny sir, engineered by my mate,
aided by those you saw him lead ashore.

378
01:19:40,728 --> 01:19:43,174
My bosen here and most of
those aboard are loyal.

379
01:19:43,352 --> 01:19:45,862
It's the mutineers
who control the firearms sir.

380
01:19:46,137 --> 01:19:47,137
And your ship?

381
01:19:47,643 --> 01:19:51,935
As fine as ever for sail, beyond the
reef, waiting only for the next tide.

382
01:19:52,372 --> 01:19:54,972
They anchored here to
take on water and abandon us...

383
01:19:55,173 --> 01:19:59,643
- when they surprised and killed the savages.
- Fernandez...

384
01:20:00,032 --> 01:20:02,132
Should they return to the ship we're lost.

385
01:20:04,008 --> 01:20:05,336
We prevent their return...

386
01:20:06,307 --> 01:20:09,507
you think it possible, armed of course,
to reassert your command?

387
01:20:09,508 --> 01:20:10,804
Nothing could prevent me.

388
01:20:11,522 --> 01:20:13,320
- On 2 conditions then.
- Agreed.

389
01:20:13,514 --> 01:20:16,491
First, while you are upon this island
you will be governed by my orders.

390
01:20:16,492 --> 01:20:17,207
Accepted, second.

391
01:20:17,237 --> 01:20:20,576
Second, if we recover your
ship, you will carry me...

392
01:20:21,952 --> 01:20:24,397
and my man to England, passage free.

393
01:20:24,705 --> 01:20:28,899
Or your home in China, India,
three times around the world.

394
01:20:35,797 --> 01:20:38,113
Fernandez.

395
01:20:42,372 --> 01:20:44,478
Fernandez.

396
01:20:45,271 --> 01:20:47,652
- Mate?
- Yes, lead of the mutiny.

397
01:20:48,235 --> 01:20:50,308
Fernandez.

398
01:20:58,179 --> 01:20:59,733
They're going to escape.

399
01:21:00,737 --> 01:21:06,130
Unless I've forgotten the ways of civilization
Captain, they'll not be putting back yet.

400
01:21:14,405 --> 01:21:17,595
Hey, what's that?

401
01:21:34,177 --> 01:21:35,440
Kill him.

402
01:21:35,975 --> 01:21:38,420
- I'll cut his throat.
- Wait.

403
01:21:42,129 --> 01:21:43,424
Gold.

404
01:21:48,201 --> 01:21:49,820
Where you find this?

405
01:21:52,006 --> 01:21:56,799
- There?
- Let's get it, take your arms.

406
01:22:25,577 --> 01:22:28,929
Which way? Come on.

407
01:23:06,905 --> 01:23:08,573
You, take a look.

408
01:23:12,411 --> 01:23:15,003
- Nobody here.
- Over we go.

409
01:23:57,933 --> 01:23:59,375
Come here.

410
01:24:02,889 --> 01:24:07,488
Drop arms, in the name of the
governor of this island, drop arms.

411
01:24:18,111 --> 01:24:19,876
Drop arms or I blow your head of.

412
01:24:40,944 --> 01:24:44,167
No, was I that young?

413
01:24:49,818 --> 01:24:53,761
Master, the boat
arrived, the captain is waiting.

414
01:24:54,482 --> 01:24:55,534
Thank you Friday.

415
01:24:59,226 --> 01:25:00,830
I didn't expect it yet.

416
01:25:02,901 --> 01:25:07,064
The proof of the pudding, so the
people cannot say that Crusoe is mad.

417
01:25:09,558 --> 01:25:11,708
These are presents for our friends outside.

418
01:25:42,594 --> 01:25:48,053
You commanded the Captain to punish us
harshly for our sins, did you not Governor?

419
01:25:48,327 --> 01:25:51,327
Nothing of the sort, I asked the Captain
to grant your request to remain here...

420
01:25:51,328 --> 01:25:54,387
rather than return to the gallows.

421
01:25:57,396 --> 01:26:02,319
Started ill, but you'll live
to regret your sacrilegious waste.

422
01:26:04,052 --> 01:26:06,659
What I have here are instructions for you.

423
01:26:07,258 --> 01:26:10,351
Time of planting, care of livestock...

424
01:26:10,934 --> 01:26:13,201
places of concealment of weapons and powder.

425
01:26:14,190 --> 01:26:16,489
Information also as to the savages.

426
01:26:17,332 --> 01:26:21,105
Who do, on occasion, visit this place.

427
01:26:23,874 --> 01:26:28,439
Whether or not you learn the lessons I
have learned and survive I cannot foresee.

428
01:26:28,619 --> 01:26:31,469
You have something
which I for years did not have,

429
01:26:31,923 --> 01:26:36,989
Something for which I wept, for
which my soul shriveled and starved.

430
01:26:38,141 --> 01:26:41,170
You have others of you're
own kind, you have companions.

431
01:26:43,810 --> 01:26:45,640
You have man.

432
01:26:49,672 --> 01:26:53,722
You can sever the ropes that bind you,
it should cost you an hour of painful work.

433
01:26:54,675 --> 01:26:56,440
By then we shall have set sail.

434
01:27:23,762 --> 01:27:25,412
From what you saw today Friday...

435
01:27:25,656 --> 01:27:29,156
Are you not a little afraid of
coming back with me to the civilization?

436
01:27:29,157 --> 01:27:31,961
If Master is not, Friday is not.

437
01:28:21,220 --> 01:28:24,769
And thus, I left the island
after I had been on it...

438
01:28:24,799 --> 01:28:30,095
eight and twenty years,
two months and Nineteen days.
