SIMON OF THE DESERT

3
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:15,896
For six years,
six weeks and six days,

4
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:18,910
you've stood on that column, Simon.

5
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:21,879
Your asceticism has edified us all.

6
00:02:21,946 --> 00:02:24,683
Honor us now by mounting
this other pedestal,

7
00:02:24,772 --> 00:02:29,836
presented to you through
the munificence of this wealthy man.

8
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,910
From your new column

9
00:02:33,308 --> 00:02:37,137
you can continue to inspire
our brothers by your penance

10
00:02:37,316 --> 00:02:41,979
in the footsteps of our father,
Simeon Stylites.

11
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,275
Accept this column

12
00:02:44,493 --> 00:02:49,454
as a gesture
of our family's gratitude to you

13
00:02:49,704 --> 00:02:52,321
for curing me
of an unspeakable disease.

14
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,286
Help me!

15
00:03:35,886 --> 00:03:37,946
Let the holy man pass!

16
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:43,951
Help us, Father Simon.

17
00:03:48,386 --> 00:03:49,376
Wait.

18
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:00,840
Your mother wishes to be near you
until the hour of her passing.

19
00:04:00,978 --> 00:04:02,947
Let her embrace you one last time.

20
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:04,987
It would have been better for you

21
00:04:05,061 --> 00:04:07,997
had you stayed in the peace
of your home, woman.

22
00:04:08,105 --> 00:04:12,481
Be dutiful, Simon,
and receive her with gladness.

23
00:04:16,353 --> 00:04:19,323
Stay near me
if you so desire, Mother.

24
00:04:19,374 --> 00:04:23,311
But I take my leave of you in this life
with this embrace.

25
00:04:23,934 --> 00:04:27,894
My love for you must not come
between my Lord and his servant.

26
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,069
Farewell.

27
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,136
We will meet again in his presence.

28
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,131
Your blessing, Father.

29
00:04:46,182 --> 00:04:52,122
First allow me to bestow
holy orders on you.

30
00:05:02,824 --> 00:05:04,759
Prepare yourself, my son.

31
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,246
<i>Behold him whose ministry –</i>
- No!

32
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:11,769
I am not worthy.
Holy orders, no!

33
00:05:12,204 --> 00:05:15,197
<i>Behold him
whose ministry is offered you.</i>

34
00:05:16,799 --> 00:05:18,791
I am unfit to receive such grace.

35
00:05:19,311 --> 00:05:21,303
I, an unworthy sinner.

36
00:05:21,995 --> 00:05:26,098
Ascend your calvary, Simon.
May peace be with you.

37
00:06:03,967 --> 00:06:05,959
Brother Simon.

38
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,182
Let us pray.

39
00:06:14,498 --> 00:06:16,927
Our Father, who art in heaven...

40
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,842
hallowed be thy name.

41
00:06:24,855 --> 00:06:26,847
Thy kingdom come...

42
00:06:29,711 --> 00:06:31,201
thy will be done...

43
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:35,969
on earth as it is in heaven.

44
00:06:39,823 --> 00:06:40,847
O blessed one!

45
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:43,874
Look at these stumps
that once were hands.

46
00:06:43,941 --> 00:06:47,935
Every day we grow poorer,
and my daughters go hungry.

47
00:06:49,947 --> 00:06:52,883
How did this misfortune befall you?

48
00:06:53,134 --> 00:06:55,886
They were chopped off.

49
00:06:55,953 --> 00:06:56,943
But why?

50
00:06:57,888 --> 00:06:59,259
For stealing.

51
00:06:59,957 --> 00:07:01,759
It's true.

52
00:07:01,943 --> 00:07:03,878
But I am repentant.

53
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:06,931
Father, relieve my suffering.

54
00:07:07,477 --> 00:07:09,957
Help us.
Have pity on these children.

55
00:07:16,044 --> 00:07:18,389
I can only pray.

56
00:07:18,974 --> 00:07:22,035
Pray with me in silence.

57
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:33,387
Perhaps God will allow us
to witness one of Simon's miracles.

58
00:07:33,547 --> 00:07:35,106
Amen.

59
00:07:46,937 --> 00:07:48,906
You are whole.

60
00:07:49,486 --> 00:07:53,390
Give thanks to the Lord
and go about your business.

61
00:08:00,774 --> 00:08:02,800
Fabiola, let's go home.

62
00:08:02,953 --> 00:08:05,946
The garden needs digging.
- We'll have to buy a new hoe.

63
00:08:05,989 --> 00:08:09,892
The old one is broken.
Let's go, girls.

64
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:16,703
Are these the same hands
you had before, Father?

65
00:08:17,165 --> 00:08:19,993
Be quiet, foolish girl.
Leave me be.

66
00:08:27,494 --> 00:08:29,486
- See that?
- What?

67
00:08:29,682 --> 00:08:31,674
- That thing with the hands.
- Oh, that.

68
00:08:32,021 --> 00:08:33,990
Any bread left?
- Yes.

69
00:08:34,057 --> 00:08:35,902
Give me a bit.

70
00:08:49,347 --> 00:08:52,785
We've spent long enough
on these spiritual shenanigans.

71
00:08:52,902 --> 00:08:54,843
Shall we go, Father?

72
00:08:54,894 --> 00:09:00,421
We must accompany Simon's solitude
a while in prayer.

73
00:09:24,703 --> 00:09:27,696
Where did that
one-eyed woman come from?

74
00:09:28,358 --> 00:09:30,546
One-eyed?
You're mistaken, Simon.

75
00:09:31,631 --> 00:09:33,623
She has one eye, I tell you.

76
00:09:34,388 --> 00:09:37,241
She has two eyes, both healthy.

77
00:09:37,429 --> 00:09:39,523
- How do you know?
- Because I looked.

78
00:09:40,363 --> 00:09:42,539
And there was nothing wrong
with either eye.

79
00:09:43,502 --> 00:09:46,472
How could you forget
the commandments that say,

80
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:49,506
"Lay not thine eyes upon woman,"

81
00:09:50,255 --> 00:09:54,249
and "Be thou not seduced
by a woman's gaze,"

82
00:09:54,669 --> 00:09:55,741
and especially...

83
00:09:56,937 --> 00:10:01,725
"Be thou not burned
in the fire of vain contemplation"?

84
00:10:06,087 --> 00:10:07,959
My brother,

85
00:10:08,061 --> 00:10:12,426
I pray you not to come here again

86
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:16,756
until your gaze regains
its due moderation.

87
00:10:53,893 --> 00:10:55,885
<i>Good day, Brother Matthew.</i>

88
00:10:56,451 --> 00:10:58,420
God be with you, brother.

89
00:10:58,953 --> 00:11:00,979
Where's the milk for the monastery?

90
00:11:01,295 --> 00:11:04,356
Some whore breathed on it
and curdled it.

91
00:11:05,366 --> 00:11:08,749
At the crack of dawn,
I'll bring a fresh jugful.

92
00:11:09,741 --> 00:11:12,417
Have you come to visit
our blessed Simon?

93
00:11:12,796 --> 00:11:17,424
Yesterday I took him a bowl of curd
and a piece of soft bread.

94
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,827
And curse my soul,

95
00:11:21,711 --> 00:11:23,616
the so-and-so paid me no heed.

96
00:11:23,754 --> 00:11:24,944
Don't curse.

97
00:11:25,077 --> 00:11:28,492
Forgive Father Simon.
He must have been praying.

98
00:11:29,436 --> 00:11:30,529
What's wrong with her?

99
00:11:31,438 --> 00:11:33,464
She's got a bad foot.

100
00:11:33,624 --> 00:11:35,442
You like her, don't you?

101
00:11:35,555 --> 00:11:38,548
Her name's Domitila.

102
00:11:40,396 --> 00:11:42,365
Look what a pair of beauties.

103
00:11:42,826 --> 00:11:45,710
You just touch them,
and they firm up.

104
00:11:47,801 --> 00:11:49,647
Abide with God, brother.

105
00:11:53,636 --> 00:11:55,605
Don't love those animals so.

106
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:59,105
The devil roams this wilderness.

107
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,572
I hear him in the night.

108
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,562
<i>Avert thy wrath.</i>

109
00:12:20,635 --> 00:12:22,627
<i>They could not...</i>

110
00:12:23,499 --> 00:12:25,449
<i>my heart...</i>

111
00:12:25,734 --> 00:12:27,726
<i>O my Lord –</i>

112
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:31,431
I can't remember how it ends.

113
00:12:32,038 --> 00:12:33,701
<i>My heart –</i>

114
00:12:37,902 --> 00:12:39,519
Here I am!

115
00:12:40,561 --> 00:12:43,554
I've brought your food,
O blessed one.

116
00:12:45,512 --> 00:12:49,347
May the peace of God be with you.
- And with you, brother.

117
00:12:49,886 --> 00:12:53,191
I've brought oil and bread
as well as your lettuce.

118
00:12:53,426 --> 00:12:55,652
My body doesn't need
those delicacies.

119
00:12:56,523 --> 00:13:00,517
It is sufficiently nourished
with the lettuce God gives me.

120
00:13:02,313 --> 00:13:04,339
I'm fasting too, Father.

121
00:13:04,754 --> 00:13:06,371
But the problem is,

122
00:13:06,454 --> 00:13:08,996
the less I eat, the fatter I get.

123
00:13:11,222 --> 00:13:13,913
The abbot wants you to eat more.

124
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:16,409
Thank him for his concern,

125
00:13:16,577 --> 00:13:18,569
but ask his forgiveness.

126
00:13:19,908 --> 00:13:23,902
I know better than he
how necessary it is for me to fast.

127
00:13:24,277 --> 00:13:25,933
I ask your forgiveness as well.

128
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:30,266
Things have changed a lot in the abbey.
They no longer give us wine.

129
00:13:31,105 --> 00:13:33,731
Our water has cumin and pepper in it.

130
00:13:33,954 --> 00:13:35,946
The abbot says it makes you strong.

131
00:13:36,956 --> 00:13:40,714
What have you been eating
these last five days?

132
00:13:42,502 --> 00:13:44,437
You've hardly drunk any water.

133
00:13:45,981 --> 00:13:47,973
And what's left smells awful.

134
00:14:03,746 --> 00:14:05,515
Do you need anything else, Father?

135
00:14:09,927 --> 00:14:12,863
Go in peace.
Let me fight my battle.

136
00:14:13,243 --> 00:14:14,267
Battle?

137
00:14:14,702 --> 00:14:17,695
An innocent like you
knows nothing of these things.

138
00:14:20,669 --> 00:14:21,659
My son.

139
00:14:22,874 --> 00:14:24,902
You look very clean.

140
00:14:27,386 --> 00:14:28,504
Thank you, Father

141
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:33,444
But remember that cleanliness
in body and clothing,

142
00:14:33,754 --> 00:14:36,457
innocent enough in ordinary men,

143
00:14:36,972 --> 00:14:40,808
is a sin in those
who dedicate their lives to God.

144
00:14:41,495 --> 00:14:45,214
If you say so, Father.
I'll keep it in mind.

145
00:15:01,733 --> 00:15:04,726
<i>In righteousness
shalt thou be worshipped.</i>

146
00:15:04,957 --> 00:15:07,668
He's an idiot, the conceited ass!

147
00:15:08,552 --> 00:15:09,576
<i>In righteousness –</i>

148
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,441
Man is the most despicable
of all thy creatures, Lord.

149
00:15:14,871 --> 00:15:17,397
His very presence
distances me from thee.

150
00:15:17,698 --> 00:15:20,691
<i>My help cometh even from the Lord.</i>

151
00:15:22,069 --> 00:15:23,714
Funny, there are no flies today.

152
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:26,988
<i>I'm hungry and thirsty once again.</i>

153
00:15:27,434 --> 00:15:29,403
<i>I'd managed to forget my body,</i>

154
00:15:29,581 --> 00:15:32,336
<i>but that wretch made me remember.</i>

155
00:15:35,655 --> 00:15:39,466
<i>No! I'll eat nothing until sunset.</i>

156
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:42,659
How long before I am worthy of thee?

157
00:15:48,028 --> 00:15:50,732
<i>How greatly tempted
I am to descend</i>

158
00:15:50,903 --> 00:15:53,896
<i>and feel mother earth under my feet.</i>

159
00:15:54,243 --> 00:15:56,212
<i>And run, and run...</i>

160
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:58,833
Not so fast.

161
00:16:07,217 --> 00:16:09,897
Do you ever think of me, my son?

162
00:16:10,226 --> 00:16:12,038
Hardly ever, Mother.

163
00:16:12,315 --> 00:16:13,374
I don't have time.

164
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:16,405
Why are you so proud, my son?

165
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:19,002
Proud of my freedom.

166
00:16:19,685 --> 00:16:21,692
Or of my enslavement, Mother.

167
00:16:22,254 --> 00:16:25,247
<i>Here I am, Simon!</i>

168
00:16:28,286 --> 00:16:30,396
Watch this!

169
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:35,902
<i>Cease from thy folly</i>

170
00:16:36,459 --> 00:16:40,295
<i>Count as lost</i>

171
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,318
<i>That which has perished</i>

172
00:16:44,724 --> 00:16:48,387
<i>Thou alone</i>

173
00:16:48,584 --> 00:16:51,482
<i>Above all the hirsute</i>

174
00:16:52,425 --> 00:16:57,454
<i>Thou, son of rabbit-ridden Syria</i>

175
00:16:57,768 --> 00:17:03,459
<i>You good man, Simeon</i>

176
00:17:03,581 --> 00:17:10,342
<i>With the lovely thick beard</i>

177
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:13,531
<i>And teeth brushed clean</i>

178
00:17:14,107 --> 00:17:17,306
<i>With Syria's urine</i>

179
00:17:19,299 --> 00:17:22,326
- What are you doing here?
- Playing.

180
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:26,360
- Where did you come from?
- Over there.

181
00:17:26,494 --> 00:17:28,520
- And where are you going?
- Over there.

182
00:17:30,537 --> 00:17:31,596
Who are you?

183
00:17:32,352 --> 00:17:34,761
I'm an innocent little girl, Simon.

184
00:17:35,245 --> 00:17:38,215
Look what innocent legs I've got.

185
00:17:38,568 --> 00:17:42,630
<i>In my kingdom, Simeon</i>

186
00:17:43,443 --> 00:17:48,404
<i>Neither is everyone what they seem</i>

187
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:52,586
<i>Nor do they seem</i>

188
00:17:52,637 --> 00:17:54,697
<i>What they are</i>

189
00:17:55,524 --> 00:17:58,517
<i>What a lovely beard</i>

190
00:17:59,238 --> 00:18:02,231
<i>And teeth brushed clean</i>

191
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:05,566
<i>With Syria's urine</i>

192
00:18:08,231 --> 00:18:10,166
Look how long my tongue is.

193
00:18:22,831 --> 00:18:24,823
I fear you not, Satan.

194
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:28,495
O Christ!

195
00:18:35,266 --> 00:18:37,360
I'll be back, shaggy locks!

196
00:18:55,967 --> 00:18:57,959
<i>O heavenly father</i>

197
00:18:59,904 --> 00:19:02,965
<i>And Christ our savior</i>

198
00:19:04,952 --> 00:19:08,946
<i>I give praise to you
at the setting sun</i>

199
00:19:11,903 --> 00:19:15,965
<i>To Father, Son and Holy Ghost</i>

200
00:19:18,216 --> 00:19:21,859
<i>It is right thou should be praised</i>

201
00:19:21,988 --> 00:19:23,980
<i>By the holy voices</i>

202
00:19:24,862 --> 00:19:28,778
<i>Of the Son of God</i>

203
00:20:33,043 --> 00:20:35,012
For the Lord said,

204
00:20:35,178 --> 00:20:39,206
"Whosoever abandons father,
mother, brothers, sisters,

205
00:20:39,765 --> 00:20:43,827
wife, children and property
and follows me

206
00:20:45,181 --> 00:20:47,150
shall be repaid a hundredfold

207
00:20:47,363 --> 00:20:50,356
and shall inherit eternal life."

208
00:20:51,108 --> 00:20:53,933
In the world, I was a mere slave.

209
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:57,120
And here I am ready to serve you.

210
00:20:58,139 --> 00:20:59,281
For it is written,

211
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:04,096
"God helps those who help others."

212
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:08,013
Let us not yield in our asceticism.

213
00:21:08,463 --> 00:21:11,297
Let us spread it like an arc.

214
00:21:11,878 --> 00:21:14,905
Let us leave our past behind

215
00:21:15,143 --> 00:21:17,078
and ascend ever onwards
and upwards

216
00:21:17,129 --> 00:21:21,732
to follow the eternal calling
of the heavenly voices.

217
00:21:22,278 --> 00:21:27,129
Offer your food and raiment
to the poor and hungry,

218
00:21:27,372 --> 00:21:29,977
for they will open to you the doors
to the Kingdom of Heaven.

219
00:21:32,325 --> 00:21:34,925
Our time on earth is short.

220
00:21:35,393 --> 00:21:37,294
Look, brothers!

221
00:21:42,937 --> 00:21:46,109
The saint's got a pretty full larder.

222
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:48,149
Cheese.

223
00:21:50,084 --> 00:21:51,074
Bread.

224
00:21:54,757 --> 00:21:55,747
And wine!

225
00:21:56,132 --> 00:22:01,218
He who poses as the champion
of penance on a column

226
00:22:01,606 --> 00:22:03,585
to be above ordinary men...

227
00:22:03,678 --> 00:22:05,367
Samaritan!

228
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:08,953
is guided by the hand of Satan.

229
00:22:09,575 --> 00:22:11,476
You've seen the proof.

230
00:22:12,741 --> 00:22:16,420
"Let us not yield in our asceticism.
Spread it like an arc."

231
00:22:17,192 --> 00:22:19,889
I put my trust in you, Simon.

232
00:22:20,459 --> 00:22:24,459
This food can only be sent
by the devil to tempt you.

233
00:22:25,831 --> 00:22:29,859
I need no explanation, brother.

234
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,068
But tell these, your disciples,

235
00:22:33,365 --> 00:22:37,178
if you know why these provisions
were in your bag.

236
00:22:38,597 --> 00:22:42,591
More welcome is slander
to the pious soul

237
00:22:42,678 --> 00:22:44,928
than odious eulogies

238
00:22:45,474 --> 00:22:48,027
that arouse pride.

239
00:22:48,256 --> 00:22:52,797
This gentle one, this humble one,
calls me a slanderer, brothers.

240
00:22:57,468 --> 00:23:01,462
I swear before God that I did not place
these tasty morsels there.

241
00:23:02,813 --> 00:23:05,936
O blessed one,
give us but one word

242
00:23:06,187 --> 00:23:08,179
and we will believe you.

243
00:23:09,498 --> 00:23:10,436
Speak.

244
00:23:10,762 --> 00:23:14,722
I am thy servant, Lord.
Thy will be done.

245
00:23:15,134 --> 00:23:17,194
You see?
He shrinks from a reply.

246
00:23:17,801 --> 00:23:20,794
No one can doubt his guilt now.

247
00:23:22,028 --> 00:23:24,964
Let us pray for him, brothers.

248
00:23:25,164 --> 00:23:27,156
One servant of the Lord
accuses another,

249
00:23:28,224 --> 00:23:31,600
and we who came here to be uplifted

250
00:23:31,935 --> 00:23:33,553
find only scandal.

251
00:23:34,295 --> 00:23:37,265
Let us lift up our prayers
to the Holy Ghost.

252
00:23:37,418 --> 00:23:40,445
May he show us the guilty one.

253
00:23:41,555 --> 00:23:45,031
<i>Let us kneel and pray.</i>

254
00:24:23,194 --> 00:24:28,827
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Ghost.

255
00:24:30,107 --> 00:24:31,097
What's the matter?

256
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:33,821
Cross yourself, Brother Trifón.

257
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:39,926
You filthy eunuch!

258
00:24:40,612 --> 00:24:43,135
Yes, I put the food in your bag.

259
00:24:43,587 --> 00:24:46,330
And I haven't finished
tormenting you yet,

260
00:24:46,545 --> 00:24:48,025
son of a whore.

261
00:24:48,203 --> 00:24:50,229
I won't rest until I hear
your own filthy lips

262
00:24:50,921 --> 00:24:55,985
cursing Christ in the holy sacrament
and his so-called mother.

263
00:24:58,957 --> 00:25:01,061
In the belly of the whore.

264
00:25:02,851 --> 00:25:04,820
<i>The Lord shall avenge me.</i>

265
00:25:05,493 --> 00:25:07,462
Down with the sacred hypostasis!

266
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:09,867
Long live the sacred hypostasis!

267
00:25:10,403 --> 00:25:14,015
- Death to the anastasis!
- Long may it live!

268
00:25:14,334 --> 00:25:17,460
- Long live the apocatastasis!
- Down with it!

269
00:25:17,857 --> 00:25:19,849
What on earth is the apocatastasis?

270
00:25:20,215 --> 00:25:22,207
<i>Hear me, O Lord.</i>

271
00:25:22,847 --> 00:25:24,226
Death to Jesus Christ!

272
00:25:24,775 --> 00:25:25,708
Death to –

273
00:25:26,042 --> 00:25:27,109
Long may he live!

274
00:25:27,782 --> 00:25:30,015
<i>The Lord loveth the righteous.</i>

275
00:25:31,171 --> 00:25:33,375
I exorcise you in the name of Christ.

276
00:25:33,819 --> 00:25:36,164
Flee the body of that man!

277
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:40,875
Flee, Satan, at the sign of this cross.

278
00:25:46,981 --> 00:25:49,007
Pick him up and take him away.

279
00:25:49,494 --> 00:25:53,488
I'll finish exorcising him
at the monastery in my own way.

280
00:25:54,225 --> 00:25:56,217
Peace be with you, brother.

281
00:26:11,692 --> 00:26:13,411
Zenón!

282
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:15,841
Listen to me.

283
00:26:16,143 --> 00:26:19,411
Send that beardless youth away.

284
00:26:25,276 --> 00:26:26,266
Me?

285
00:26:26,956 --> 00:26:31,893
It is not fitting for him to live
near the temptations of the devil.

286
00:26:32,675 --> 00:26:36,893
Tell him not to return
until his beard covers his cheeks.

287
00:26:39,322 --> 00:26:44,159
Thank you for your advice,
fruit of your sound judgment.

288
00:26:44,902 --> 00:26:48,930
You may leave the monastery
to return home, Matias.

289
00:26:49,277 --> 00:26:53,968
When your face is covered with hair,
you may return.

290
00:27:09,813 --> 00:27:11,805
Don't love those old graybeards so.

291
00:27:12,308 --> 00:27:14,899
The devil roams this wilderness.

292
00:27:15,525 --> 00:27:17,128
I hear him in the night.

293
00:28:46,318 --> 00:28:47,920
<i>O God,</i>

294
00:28:48,025 --> 00:28:50,414
<i>my God,</i>

295
00:28:50,777 --> 00:28:53,074
<i>from the dawn
I keep watch for thee.</i>

296
00:28:54,802 --> 00:28:57,772
<i>My soul thirsteth for thee,</i>

297
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:01,773
<i>and my flesh too,
in all manner of ways.</i>

298
00:29:02,704 --> 00:29:03,694
O Lord.

299
00:29:05,085 --> 00:29:08,078
Lord, my thoughts
stray from thee.

300
00:29:18,607 --> 00:29:21,911
Receive, Lord,
thy most humble of servants.

301
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:26,786
You are my favorite son, Simon.

302
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,192
Your asceticism is sublime.

303
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:34,053
I love you and live in you.
You speak for me.

304
00:29:34,571 --> 00:29:37,755
For eight years,
eight months and eight days,

305
00:29:37,982 --> 00:29:40,571
your spirit has burned
atop that column

306
00:29:41,453 --> 00:29:43,479
as the flame burns atop a candle.

307
00:29:44,193 --> 00:29:46,849
Blessed are those who suffer.

308
00:29:47,588 --> 00:29:50,524
I want to die in thee, Lord.

309
00:29:51,226 --> 00:29:53,286
Deign to receive my soul.

310
00:29:54,475 --> 00:29:56,467
Why criest thou, Lord?

311
00:29:56,964 --> 00:29:58,990
I cry for you, my beloved son.

312
00:29:59,797 --> 00:30:01,789
I am saddened by your penance

313
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:04,031
and by your excessive sacrifice.

314
00:30:05,482 --> 00:30:08,393
Cease them now
if you would please me.

315
00:30:09,013 --> 00:30:10,301
Change your ways.

316
00:30:11,607 --> 00:30:12,786
Change, Lord?

317
00:30:13,458 --> 00:30:15,247
Come down off that column.

318
00:30:15,434 --> 00:30:19,153
Taste earthly pleasures
till you've had your fill.

319
00:30:22,219 --> 00:30:25,508
Till the very word pleasure
fills you with nausea.

320
00:30:26,715 --> 00:30:30,709
Only then will you be
truly close to me.

321
00:30:36,451 --> 00:30:39,780
Satan! I fear you not.

322
00:30:40,245 --> 00:30:43,181
The Lord will render useless
all your intrigues.

323
00:30:43,866 --> 00:30:47,336
How long will you go on
seeking mankind's undoing?

324
00:30:47,991 --> 00:30:50,350
You who before your fall

325
00:30:50,467 --> 00:30:53,350
rejoiced in the divine presence.

326
00:30:54,649 --> 00:30:56,618
If I repent, Simon,

327
00:30:56,706 --> 00:30:59,642
would God restore me
to my former glory?

328
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:02,225
On no account, Satan.

329
00:31:02,723 --> 00:31:04,692
Repent if you can,

330
00:31:04,912 --> 00:31:08,147
but you'll remain
like this for all of time.

331
00:31:10,204 --> 00:31:13,509
Just look what a filthy cheat
I'm rubbing shoulders with!

332
00:31:13,963 --> 00:31:16,933
You know where you can stuff
an offer like that!

333
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:21,025
I'm quite happy as I am, you swine!

334
00:31:26,166 --> 00:31:28,541
Slimy sacrament

335
00:31:29,525 --> 00:31:32,423
in the belly of a whore!

336
00:31:34,343 --> 00:31:37,279
I beseech you in the name of Christ,

337
00:31:38,115 --> 00:31:41,176
let a just man pray in peace.

338
00:31:41,978 --> 00:31:44,853
I'll be back, shaggy locks!

339
00:32:00,415 --> 00:32:03,385
If I don't free myself
from the devil today, Lord,

340
00:32:03,785 --> 00:32:05,777
I'll break free tomorrow.

341
00:32:06,321 --> 00:32:08,907
Or in five years, or ten.

342
00:32:09,485 --> 00:32:12,145
Self-restraint, prayer,

343
00:32:12,345 --> 00:32:15,205
charity and humility
will be my weapons.

344
00:32:23,182 --> 00:32:26,056
My eyes must have been blind

345
00:32:26,226 --> 00:32:29,219
to have mistaken
the wolf for the lamb.

346
00:32:30,696 --> 00:32:33,166
I deserve eternal penance.

347
00:32:33,845 --> 00:32:37,170
Until thou callest me to thy side,

348
00:32:37,563 --> 00:32:40,230
I'll use one leg only
to support my body.

349
00:33:46,583 --> 00:33:49,563
I thank thee, Lord,
for providing my sustenance.

350
00:34:00,736 --> 00:34:04,189
Make fertile the soil
that feeds the poor,

351
00:34:04,272 --> 00:34:06,207
and let hail not fall.

352
00:34:22,698 --> 00:34:25,691
I bless you,
poor innocent creature.

353
00:34:26,212 --> 00:34:28,400
Go and sing the glories of the Lord.

354
00:34:34,099 --> 00:34:36,159
Who can I bless now?

355
00:34:37,301 --> 00:34:41,049
Besides being a spiritual exercise,
blessings are good fun too.

356
00:34:41,869 --> 00:34:44,163
And I don't offend anyone.

357
00:34:44,792 --> 00:34:46,682
What am I saying?

358
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:51,030
I'm beginning to realize
I don't realize what I'm saying.

359
00:34:51,861 --> 00:34:54,627
What am I saying?

360
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,410
<i>Father!</i>

361
00:34:58,016 --> 00:35:00,338
Bless Pelagia's pregnancy.

362
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:04,603
Let's see if the bitch drops
what she's carrying.

363
00:35:05,028 --> 00:35:07,054
You too have my blessing, brother,

364
00:35:07,253 --> 00:35:10,010
you who are poor in spirit
and worldly goods.

365
00:35:10,502 --> 00:35:13,529
Don't bless me
in the same breath as my goats!

366
00:35:14,127 --> 00:35:17,120
But I respect you and love you,

367
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:21,083
and tomorrow I'll bring you
a bowl of fresh milk.

368
00:35:21,307 --> 00:35:23,126
Thank you, my son.

369
00:35:23,619 --> 00:35:26,139
But you know it's no use.

370
00:35:26,725 --> 00:35:29,111
I've got a feeling he's not
quite right in the head.

371
00:35:31,843 --> 00:35:35,343
It must come from
stuffing yourself with air.

372
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:40,176
Believe me, I eat and drink
quite enough to fulfill my needs.

373
00:35:40,514 --> 00:35:43,226
I'm not a spirit or disincarnate,

374
00:35:43,414 --> 00:35:47,617
but a man whose flesh
weighs heavily upon him.

375
00:35:47,898 --> 00:35:51,164
As for the need
to evacuate my bowels,

376
00:35:51,437 --> 00:35:55,562
my excrement is like your goats'
because I'm so withered up.

377
00:35:55,789 --> 00:35:59,229
The only thing I understood
of all that was "withered up."

378
00:36:51,122 --> 00:36:52,181
What do you want?

379
00:36:52,772 --> 00:36:54,832
I want your forgiveness
and your blessing.

380
00:36:57,288 --> 00:36:58,879
Who are you?

381
00:36:58,965 --> 00:37:00,395
Why must I forgive you?

382
00:37:00,881 --> 00:37:02,941
I was the one
who gazed upon a woman.

383
00:37:04,781 --> 00:37:07,233
God has already forgiven you.

384
00:37:07,795 --> 00:37:11,391
I'd like to give you some rather
unsavory news about God's servants.

385
00:37:12,391 --> 00:37:15,048
The hordes of the Antichrist
are advancing on Rome.

386
00:37:15,414 --> 00:37:17,164
They'll be here before long.

387
00:37:17,343 --> 00:37:21,288
Blessed is the scourge
if it wins us glory before the Lord.

388
00:37:22,028 --> 00:37:24,998
Mankind will forever be entwined
in fratricidal conflict,

389
00:37:25,258 --> 00:37:27,988
and all because of that
cursed "yours" and "mine."

390
00:37:28,165 --> 00:37:29,189
What do you mean?

391
00:37:30,015 --> 00:37:32,211
Man kills to defend
what he considers his.

392
00:37:33,625 --> 00:37:35,117
I don't understand.

393
00:37:35,446 --> 00:37:38,112
What is "yours" and "mine"?

394
00:37:38,982 --> 00:37:39,950
Look.

395
00:37:40,389 --> 00:37:42,324
I'll explain.

396
00:37:44,061 --> 00:37:46,087
This is your bag, isn't it?

397
00:37:46,649 --> 00:37:50,090
If I say it's not,
we'll start to quarrel.

398
00:37:50,492 --> 00:37:52,069
Let's try it.

399
00:37:52,828 --> 00:37:54,854
Simon, this bag is mine.

400
00:37:55,632 --> 00:37:57,317
Now, you say it's yours.

401
00:37:57,410 --> 00:37:59,933
- It's mine.
- No, it's mine.

402
00:38:00,214 --> 00:38:02,206
All right, take it then.

403
00:38:06,477 --> 00:38:10,346
Your unselfishness is admirable
and very good for your soul.

404
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:13,315
But I fear that, like your penance,

405
00:38:14,841 --> 00:38:16,833
it is of little use to man.

406
00:38:17,849 --> 00:38:19,223
I don't understand you.

407
00:38:19,715 --> 00:38:22,032
We speak in different tongues.

408
00:38:23,123 --> 00:38:24,903
Go in peace, brother.

409
00:39:23,358 --> 00:39:25,350
Protect me, Lord!

410
00:39:39,453 --> 00:39:41,422
I promised I'd return.

411
00:39:41,533 --> 00:39:43,525
This is the last time.

412
00:39:44,302 --> 00:39:46,328
<i>Get thee behind me, Satan!</i>

413
00:39:47,344 --> 00:39:50,337
Not behind, nor anywhere else.

414
00:39:51,125 --> 00:39:53,305
Abominable lord of darkness!

415
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:57,242
If the Lord has sent you
to tempt me, so be it,

416
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:59,339
but you will not succeed.

417
00:39:59,469 --> 00:40:03,067
You disgust me. I can smell
your foul breath from here.

418
00:40:04,416 --> 00:40:06,408
You don't smell too good either.

419
00:40:07,188 --> 00:40:08,953
Prepare yourself, Simon.

420
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:12,141
We're going on a long, long journey.

421
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,512
In the name of Christ.

422
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:22,042
Making gestures with your hand
won't help you this time.

423
00:40:23,605 --> 00:40:25,597
Simon of the desert,

424
00:40:25,949 --> 00:40:29,943
you may not believe it,
but you and I are very much alike.

425
00:40:30,734 --> 00:40:32,118
Like you,

426
00:40:32,207 --> 00:40:34,176
I believe in God the Father Almighty,

427
00:40:34,399 --> 00:40:36,391
because I've been in his presence.

428
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:39,119
As for his only Son,

429
00:40:39,193 --> 00:40:41,185
I could tell you a thing or two.

430
00:40:44,113 --> 00:40:46,445
<i>I believe in God almighty –</i>

431
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:49,113
Get ready to leave, Simon.

432
00:40:49,758 --> 00:40:52,687
I'm taking you to the sabbath.

433
00:40:53,496 --> 00:40:56,093
There you'll see tongues of flame...

434
00:40:56,847 --> 00:40:58,907
and the gaping
red wounds of the flesh.

435
00:41:00,308 --> 00:41:01,298
Enough!

436
00:41:02,523 --> 00:41:04,116
Let's go.

437
00:41:04,469 --> 00:41:06,352
They're coming for us.

438
00:44:18,055 --> 00:44:20,000
What are you thinking about, Simon?

439
00:44:20,373 --> 00:44:21,363
Nothing.

440
00:44:21,766 --> 00:44:23,648
What's this dance called?

441
00:44:24,274 --> 00:44:25,805
"Radioactive flesh."

442
00:44:25,921 --> 00:44:27,947
It's the latest dance,

443
00:44:28,359 --> 00:44:30,101
the final dance.

444
00:44:30,344 --> 00:44:32,836
<i>- Get thee behind me.
- Get thee gone.</i>

445
00:44:36,358 --> 00:44:38,625
Have fun.
I'm going home.

446
00:44:38,919 --> 00:44:41,140
Better not.
You'll get a nasty surprise.

447
00:44:41,867 --> 00:44:42,891
What is it?

448
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:46,242
Another tenant's moved in.
You'll have to stick it out.

449
00:44:48,633 --> 00:44:51,039
You'll have to stick it out
till the end.

450
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:35,120
