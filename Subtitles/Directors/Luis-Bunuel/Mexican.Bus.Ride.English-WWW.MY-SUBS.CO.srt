Ascent to Heaven

3
00:01:40,093 --> 00:01:43,429
<i>The only agricultural</i>
<i>exploitation of this town,</i>

4
00:01:43,464 --> 00:01:45,363
<i>which we will call San Jeronimito,</i>

5
00:01:45,398 --> 00:01:47,525
<i>located on the coast</i>
<i>of the state of Guerrero,</i>

6
00:01:47,667 --> 00:01:49,066
<i>are coconut trees.</i>

7
00:01:49,536 --> 00:01:52,403
<i>Oil is extracted from</i>
<i>the white coconut pith,</i>

8
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:55,765
<i>which is then used by</i>
<i>several industries.</i>

9
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:59,376
<i>The occupants of these</i>
<i>humble dwellings</i>

10
00:01:59,546 --> 00:02:01,070
<i>are almost all wealthy</i>

11
00:02:01,247 --> 00:02:03,715
<i>owners of several</i>
<i>hundred palm trees.</i>

12
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:05,812
<i>The people of the coast maintain,</i>

13
00:02:05,919 --> 00:02:07,477
<i>with their exaggerated charm,</i>

14
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:11,517
<i>that a coconut tree yields</i>
<i>as much as a milk cow.</i>

15
00:02:13,059 --> 00:02:15,254
<i>There is no church in the village.</i>

16
00:02:15,795 --> 00:02:18,958
<i>Thus, the inhabitants</i>
<i>preserve their tradition</i>

17
00:02:19,098 --> 00:02:21,692
<i>of celebrating weddings</i>
<i>with a trip</i>

18
00:02:21,868 --> 00:02:23,358
<i>to a heavenly island</i>

19
00:02:23,636 --> 00:02:26,196
<i>situated one mile off the coast.</i>

20
00:02:27,106 --> 00:02:29,666
<i>Spending the night</i>
<i>on this deserted island...</i>

21
00:02:30,009 --> 00:02:32,068
<i>... consecrates the newlywed's union...</i>

22
00:02:32,412 --> 00:02:35,404
<i>... who must then be forgiven</i>
<i>by the bride's mother...</i>

23
00:02:35,548 --> 00:02:37,846
<i>... before embarking on the trip.</i>

24
00:02:38,851 --> 00:02:41,718
<i>Let's see the daily</i>
<i>arrival of the vehicle...</i>

25
00:02:41,888 --> 00:02:43,756
<i>... that brings news from the world...</i>

26
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:45,690
<i>... to this isolated corner.</i>

27
00:03:16,456 --> 00:03:18,556
Careful, don't touch that garment.

28
00:03:18,591 --> 00:03:21,461
It has to be white.
Take care of it, Mrs. Linda.

29
00:03:21,496 --> 00:03:24,021
Don't worry, Silvestre.
I'll take it.

30
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:39,545
Look, such lovely
organdie endives.

31
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,381
It looks just like the dress...

32
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:43,147
...worn by Gen. Mendez's daughter.

33
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:46,753
Yes, but you'd rather your
daughter had worn a...

34
00:03:46,788 --> 00:03:48,187
...rough cotton dress instead...

35
00:03:48,222 --> 00:03:49,119
...of eloping.

36
00:03:49,289 --> 00:03:50,586
Go ahead, Mrs. Linda.

37
00:03:50,657 --> 00:03:53,157
Albina must be dressed by now.

38
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:55,428
If you're in such a hurry, go ahead.

39
00:03:55,463 --> 00:03:57,662
I'll pick up the train.

40
00:03:57,697 --> 00:04:00,133
- Hurrah for the newlyweds.
- Hurrah.

41
00:04:00,168 --> 00:04:01,998
Hurrah!

42
00:04:04,237 --> 00:04:05,727
- Hurrah for the newlyweds.
- Hurrah.

43
00:04:07,106 --> 00:04:08,368
Hurrah for the newlyweds.

44
00:04:09,942 --> 00:04:12,638
- Hurrah for the newlyweds.
- Hurrah.

45
00:04:19,285 --> 00:04:20,946
Hurrah for the newlyweds.

46
00:04:26,292 --> 00:04:27,156
Hurrah.

47
00:04:42,975 --> 00:04:45,739
I have a mind to keep
you here all day.

48
00:04:46,012 --> 00:04:48,480
If you think we're happy,
you're mistaken.

49
00:04:49,148 --> 00:04:53,016
I doubt you can support yourself,
let alone a wife.

50
00:04:53,619 --> 00:04:55,883
You're both so young.

51
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:00,360
Come on, Mrs. Clara,
forgive them.

52
00:05:00,395 --> 00:05:02,851
- Yes, yes.
- Forgive them.

53
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:04,362
Forgive them.

54
00:05:04,397 --> 00:05:07,230
The food's getting cold,
we're hungry.

55
00:05:08,101 --> 00:05:09,552
Let them get up, woman.

56
00:05:09,587 --> 00:05:10,968
Oliverio's mother is ill.

57
00:05:11,003 --> 00:05:14,200
I could keep them here
until they grow roots.

58
00:05:14,574 --> 00:05:15,700
But...

59
00:05:16,008 --> 00:05:18,442
You should thank God.
You can get up now.

60
00:05:18,544 --> 00:05:20,378
Mother, I'm so happy.

61
00:05:20,413 --> 00:05:22,331
I know Albina is your whole life.

62
00:05:22,366 --> 00:05:24,215
I'll try to be
a worthy son to you.

63
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:27,086
I know you'll be happy,
you have our blessings.

64
00:05:27,121 --> 00:05:29,418
Go on, go. Go let the people in.

65
00:05:33,493 --> 00:05:35,461
Come in, she forgave me.

66
00:05:53,413 --> 00:05:55,677
Hurrah for the newlyweds!

67
00:06:05,358 --> 00:06:07,121
Hurrah for the newlyweds.

68
00:06:30,716 --> 00:06:31,580
Are you happy?

69
00:06:31,818 --> 00:06:34,616
I am, Oliverio. I wouldn't
trade places with anybody.

70
00:06:35,054 --> 00:06:37,784
But a wedding in Mexico City
would have been nice.

71
00:06:38,391 --> 00:06:40,726
And spending our honeymoon
at your mother's house...

72
00:06:40,761 --> 00:06:42,091
...in Portales.

73
00:06:42,462 --> 00:06:43,828
Will it ever be ours?

74
00:06:43,863 --> 00:06:46,731
- Who knows.
- To have such a large house.

75
00:06:46,766 --> 00:06:49,599
And spend our wedding night
on a desert island.

76
00:06:50,603 --> 00:06:51,661
That's the custom.

77
00:06:51,871 --> 00:06:54,169
- I'm anxious to go.
- What about me?

78
00:06:54,841 --> 00:06:58,436
With you, the island
is like a palace.

79
00:07:09,455 --> 00:07:11,102
Get ready for the worst.

80
00:07:11,137 --> 00:07:12,749
It's Felipe, my brother.

81
00:07:20,299 --> 00:07:21,866
Mother got worse.

82
00:07:21,901 --> 00:07:25,371
I said you shouldn't
have gotten married today.

83
00:07:25,406 --> 00:07:27,738
It was mother,
she asked me to.

84
00:07:27,773 --> 00:07:30,503
Thanks to that you
may not see her alive.

85
00:07:30,743 --> 00:07:32,335
Tie the boat and come.

86
00:07:36,382 --> 00:07:38,115
If something terrible happens...

87
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:40,820
...we'll have to decide
about the property.

88
00:07:40,855 --> 00:07:41,986
Don't say that now.

89
00:07:42,021 --> 00:07:43,672
It's got to be said sometime.

90
00:07:43,707 --> 00:07:45,289
I won't give up my share.

91
00:07:45,324 --> 00:07:47,760
Your soul is poisoned.
Making plans...

92
00:07:47,795 --> 00:07:49,996
...while mother is ill.

93
00:07:50,031 --> 00:07:51,128
Don't insult me.

94
00:07:51,163 --> 00:07:53,048
I'm the eldest, I'll decide.

95
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:54,899
She's still here to decide.

96
00:07:54,934 --> 00:07:57,336
What if she gives
it all to the boy?

97
00:07:57,371 --> 00:07:59,069
We'll do what she decides.

98
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:00,767
It's her call, isn't it?

99
00:08:18,891 --> 00:08:20,660
All right, <i>Chuchito,</i> all right.

100
00:08:20,695 --> 00:08:23,026
Go play, go on. Go play.

101
00:08:28,267 --> 00:08:30,030
Are you feeling better, mother?

102
00:08:30,536 --> 00:08:32,663
I won't make it this time.

103
00:08:32,838 --> 00:08:34,272
You have many years ahead.

104
00:08:34,307 --> 00:08:35,899
But if something should happen...

105
00:08:36,075 --> 00:08:38,669
...God forbid, God forbid...

106
00:08:38,811 --> 00:08:41,146
...trust me to settle the property.

107
00:08:41,181 --> 00:08:43,082
Did you think I'd fall that easy?

108
00:08:43,117 --> 00:08:44,984
I didn't think anything, mother.

109
00:08:45,019 --> 00:08:46,383
It's just in case.

110
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:48,721
You know I'm the son
who loves you the most.

111
00:08:48,756 --> 00:08:51,121
Yes, I know. I know you.

112
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,687
You're closing in.

113
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:54,990
I just want to fix things.

114
00:08:55,094 --> 00:08:56,994
To solve this.

115
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:00,132
The big coconut tree field
can go to Felipe.

116
00:09:00,167 --> 00:09:01,866
It's fair to give Oliverio...

117
00:09:01,901 --> 00:09:03,836
...the boats and the refrigerator...

118
00:09:03,871 --> 00:09:05,463
...since he just got married.

119
00:09:05,638 --> 00:09:07,629
The other field is for <i>Chuchito.</i>

120
00:09:08,474 --> 00:09:11,238
I'll settle for the
little house in Portales.

121
00:09:11,577 --> 00:09:13,238
Not because of what it's worth.

122
00:09:15,281 --> 00:09:18,444
I have aspirations
and want to move to the city.

123
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:20,450
Mother.

124
00:09:21,053 --> 00:09:23,146
Mother, are you feeling worse?

125
00:09:23,322 --> 00:09:25,153
No, but leave me alone.

126
00:09:34,033 --> 00:09:35,728
Give that to me, how dare you.

127
00:09:39,305 --> 00:09:41,787
Look. Such a straight face.

128
00:09:41,822 --> 00:09:44,270
Get out, you'll wake mother up.

129
00:09:45,511 --> 00:09:46,808
And don't come here anymore.

130
00:09:53,252 --> 00:09:55,277
Oliverio, my son.

131
00:09:56,288 --> 00:09:58,552
He's getting married, forget him.

132
00:09:59,158 --> 00:10:00,557
Not quite, here I am.

133
00:10:00,893 --> 00:10:03,794
Thank God you're here, son.

134
00:10:04,263 --> 00:10:06,731
Juan, go do your chores.

135
00:10:07,466 --> 00:10:08,728
You too, Felipe.

136
00:10:09,602 --> 00:10:12,537
Albina... go look
for <i>Chuchito.</i>

137
00:10:13,172 --> 00:10:14,730
Leave me alone with Oliverio.

138
00:10:15,141 --> 00:10:16,108
Yes, Mrs. Ester.

139
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,108
I'm sorry, son. I interrupted...

140
00:10:18,678 --> 00:10:22,512
...your wedding night.
But I'm not feeling well.

141
00:10:22,815 --> 00:10:25,249
Don't say that,
you've been worse.

142
00:10:25,484 --> 00:10:27,543
You know I won't make it.

143
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,551
Come closer.

144
00:10:30,856 --> 00:10:33,017
I know only you are fond of <i>Chuchito...</i>

145
00:10:33,325 --> 00:10:36,590
...and you won't let
those thugs hurt him.

146
00:10:37,296 --> 00:10:39,231
I want the house in Portales...

147
00:10:39,266 --> 00:10:40,831
...to be his.

148
00:10:40,866 --> 00:10:42,916
He must go to school in the city.

149
00:10:42,951 --> 00:10:44,966
- Be somebody.
- Yes, mother.

150
00:10:45,171 --> 00:10:47,332
Do it in memory of your sister...

151
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,475
...who died giving birth to him.

152
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:51,394
I'll do it for you and for Chucho.

153
00:10:51,429 --> 00:10:53,278
I love him as if he were my son.

154
00:10:53,713 --> 00:10:55,994
But you should put it in writing.

155
00:10:56,029 --> 00:10:58,275
My siblings won't respect words.

156
00:10:58,718 --> 00:11:01,687
Go fetch the delegate
to dictate my will.

157
00:11:02,822 --> 00:11:04,050
I'm on it, mother.

158
00:11:07,526 --> 00:11:08,424
<i>Chuchito.</i>

159
00:11:12,498 --> 00:11:15,092
- Where are you going?
- I'll be right back.

160
00:11:27,446 --> 00:11:29,107
What will it be, Mr. Esteban?

161
00:11:30,182 --> 00:11:32,275
I don't mean to snub you, but...

162
00:11:32,685 --> 00:11:35,245
...a delegate shouldn't
drink too much.

163
00:11:35,387 --> 00:11:37,356
One for the road. Come on.

164
00:11:37,391 --> 00:11:38,653
To drown our woes.

165
00:11:38,824 --> 00:11:40,843
A mother cannot be replaced.

166
00:11:40,878 --> 00:11:42,827
Don't be a vulture, brother.

167
00:11:42,862 --> 00:11:45,330
God willing, mother will survive.

168
00:11:45,664 --> 00:11:47,600
I've always been strong.

169
00:11:47,635 --> 00:11:48,897
Darling mother.

170
00:11:49,435 --> 00:11:52,461
I can still see her
at the San Jose fair.

171
00:11:52,872 --> 00:11:54,533
In such good health.

172
00:12:01,781 --> 00:12:03,840
Hey, have you seen Eladio?

173
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:06,185
He was in my pocket a minute ago.

174
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,287
Not anymore. Look, he's gone.

175
00:12:08,322 --> 00:12:10,020
You're hilarious.

176
00:12:10,055 --> 00:12:12,257
He's had me waiting for an hour.

177
00:12:12,292 --> 00:12:14,707
A girl like you shouldn't wait.

178
00:12:14,742 --> 00:12:17,122
- Shall I help?
- Leave me alone.

179
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:20,431
Look who's here. Where's the bride?

180
00:12:20,466 --> 00:12:22,501
- Hello, Raquel.
- A sight for sore eyes.

181
00:12:22,536 --> 00:12:24,802
- Oliverio.
- Buddy, have a drink.

182
00:12:24,837 --> 00:12:27,533
- It's no time to party.
- Mr. Esteban...

183
00:12:28,307 --> 00:12:31,003
My mother wants a word with
you. Please, come.

184
00:12:31,143 --> 00:12:32,544
What are you up to, evil son?

185
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:33,946
Disturbing her for your greed?

186
00:12:33,981 --> 00:12:35,675
No brotherly quarrels.

187
00:12:35,948 --> 00:12:38,678
You shouldn't disturb her now.

188
00:12:39,285 --> 00:12:41,787
I never evaded a lady's call.

189
00:12:41,822 --> 00:12:43,252
It's my duty.

190
00:12:43,287 --> 00:12:44,683
You're not going.

191
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:46,657
Go away, take your wife with you.

192
00:12:46,692 --> 00:12:48,644
You didn't hesitate
to get married now.

193
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:50,596
- Are you going or not?
- He isn't.

194
00:12:50,631 --> 00:12:51,927
- No.
- Quiet.

195
00:12:52,464 --> 00:12:54,932
I'm the authority, I'll decide.

196
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,000
You're the eldest, right?

197
00:12:57,203 --> 00:12:59,330
- You don't want me to go.
- No.

198
00:13:00,339 --> 00:13:01,966
Then, I won't. I'm staying.

199
00:13:02,408 --> 00:13:04,638
You'll be responsible
if anything happens.

200
00:13:04,777 --> 00:13:08,144
Sure, I'll be responsible.
What could happen?

201
00:13:10,149 --> 00:13:11,182
Hey, Oliverio.

202
00:13:11,217 --> 00:13:13,515
- What do you want?
- To talk.

203
00:13:23,495 --> 00:13:24,462
Oliverio.

204
00:13:25,331 --> 00:13:26,730
You took so long.

205
00:13:27,132 --> 00:13:28,895
Isn't Mr. Esteban coming?

206
00:13:31,737 --> 00:13:34,672
I couldn't find him.
He's out of town for the week.

207
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,903
I feel terrible.

208
00:13:37,443 --> 00:13:39,468
Now you look yellow.

209
00:13:39,812 --> 00:13:42,303
Please Albina, the spoon.

210
00:13:43,215 --> 00:13:45,012
Look, Oliverio.

211
00:13:45,651 --> 00:13:48,347
Why wait for delegate Esteban?

212
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,215
Go to Petatlan...

213
00:13:50,456 --> 00:13:53,525
...and bring Counselor Figueroa
to draw up will.

214
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,493
Why go so far, mother?

215
00:13:55,661 --> 00:13:57,856
Counselor Ocaña is in Acapulco.

216
00:13:58,330 --> 00:13:59,490
It's not the same.

217
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:01,165
Counselor Figueroa...

218
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,869
...took charge since your father.

219
00:14:03,904 --> 00:14:05,571
And in the meantime?

220
00:14:05,606 --> 00:14:07,038
Don't worry.

221
00:14:07,373 --> 00:14:09,671
I'll be strong enough to wait.

222
00:14:10,209 --> 00:14:13,178
Go, and don't tell your siblings.

223
00:14:13,946 --> 00:14:15,243
All right, mother.

224
00:14:15,514 --> 00:14:16,879
The bus leaves at six.

225
00:14:17,116 --> 00:14:18,879
Take a nap, son.

226
00:14:19,184 --> 00:14:21,015
I also want to get some rest.

227
00:14:21,353 --> 00:14:22,411
Yes, Oliverio.

228
00:14:22,521 --> 00:14:24,819
Go to sleep. I'll wake you up.

229
00:14:25,624 --> 00:14:27,288
Let's go to Petatlan together.

230
00:14:27,323 --> 00:14:28,953
Stay and take care of mother.

231
00:14:29,161 --> 00:14:30,728
What if something happens?

232
00:14:30,763 --> 00:14:33,027
Nothing will happen,
I'll be back as soon as I can.

233
00:14:33,866 --> 00:14:34,730
Oliverio.

234
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:35,458
What?

235
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:07,299
Take my mirror.
Don't break it...

236
00:15:07,334 --> 00:15:08,599
...it's bad luck.

237
00:15:08,634 --> 00:15:11,694
- It's safe here.
- Let's see if it's true.

238
00:15:16,275 --> 00:15:17,408
A cigarette, doll.

239
00:15:17,443 --> 00:15:19,172
Yes, Congressman. Thank you.

240
00:15:20,245 --> 00:15:21,878
Come here.

241
00:15:21,913 --> 00:15:23,511
Oh, boy.

242
00:15:24,183 --> 00:15:26,515
Now me, Silvestre, now me.

243
00:15:26,752 --> 00:15:28,919
You're acting like a child.

244
00:15:28,954 --> 00:15:31,357
I can't play with you
the same way.

245
00:15:31,392 --> 00:15:33,092
Careful, don't hurt the lady.

246
00:15:33,127 --> 00:15:34,793
- Hey, Silvestre.
- Well, well.

247
00:15:34,828 --> 00:15:36,124
It's about time.

248
00:15:36,228 --> 00:15:37,562
When is the baby due?

249
00:15:37,597 --> 00:15:38,862
I'm going to Petatlan...

250
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:40,833
...to see Dr. Martinez.
- Yes, sir.

251
00:15:40,868 --> 00:15:42,566
He's one of the best.

252
00:15:42,601 --> 00:15:44,670
- Are you traveling, too?
- Yes.

253
00:15:44,705 --> 00:15:46,704
You shouldn't, should you, Feliza?

254
00:15:46,739 --> 00:15:49,264
After what happened
to your sister Jacinta.

255
00:15:49,408 --> 00:15:51,409
I'm here if you need anything.

256
00:15:51,444 --> 00:15:53,411
- Thanks.
- Careful, careful.

257
00:15:55,214 --> 00:15:56,648
I'm going with your mother.

258
00:15:56,683 --> 00:15:58,367
Wait until the bus leaves.

259
00:15:58,402 --> 00:16:00,051
It won't until it fills up.

260
00:16:00,219 --> 00:16:02,304
When one's in a hurry, things stall.

261
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:04,390
Don't worry, I'll look after her.

262
00:16:04,425 --> 00:16:05,721
Good-bye, my dear.

263
00:16:09,628 --> 00:16:10,761
You're so corny, Oli.

264
00:16:10,796 --> 00:16:12,714
Is that envy or a compliment?

265
00:16:12,749 --> 00:16:14,633
Envy? I have them by the dozen.

266
00:16:14,668 --> 00:16:16,402
Influential, like me.

267
00:16:16,437 --> 00:16:17,067
Ha.

268
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:19,321
I like ripe fruit, not rotten.

269
00:16:19,356 --> 00:16:21,540
Your influence just wilted.

270
00:16:21,575 --> 00:16:22,632
You'll see.

271
00:16:23,876 --> 00:16:25,935
I want to see my granddaughter.

272
00:16:26,045 --> 00:16:28,212
Can I pay when I get back?

273
00:16:28,247 --> 00:16:30,349
You know I always say yes, Mr. Nemesio.

274
00:16:30,384 --> 00:16:31,615
Everything's on paper.

275
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:34,353
When justice is finally done in Mexico...

276
00:16:34,388 --> 00:16:36,072
...and I get my land back...

277
00:16:36,107 --> 00:16:37,721
...you'll get every penny.

278
00:16:37,756 --> 00:16:40,782
- Much obliged, Mr. Nemesio.
- Thanks, boy.

279
00:16:42,161 --> 00:16:44,374
Does it have to be full to leave?

280
00:16:44,409 --> 00:16:46,588
Well, I have to make a profit.

281
00:16:46,698 --> 00:16:48,999
We're all in a hurry.

282
00:16:49,034 --> 00:16:50,669
- Fine, Congressman.
- Good bye.

283
00:16:50,704 --> 00:16:51,135
How much?

284
00:16:51,303 --> 00:16:53,505
Four tickets will be enough.

285
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,805
Give me the change.

286
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,842
- Fine, Mr. Eladio.
- Come on, Congressman.

287
00:16:56,877 --> 00:16:58,503
You first. Go ahead.

288
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:01,745
That's okay.

289
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:04,180
- Hurrah for Mr. Eladio.
- Hurrah, hurrah.

290
00:17:06,852 --> 00:17:08,253
Your change, Congressman.

291
00:17:08,288 --> 00:17:09,584
Thanks, Silvestre.

292
00:17:09,922 --> 00:17:12,291
- Sit over there.
- Get moving.

293
00:17:12,326 --> 00:17:13,657
- Ready?
- Let's go.

294
00:17:13,692 --> 00:17:15,319
- Step on it, man.
- Step on it.

295
00:17:26,605 --> 00:17:29,403
Well, I'll be darned.

296
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:30,641
We have a flat.

297
00:17:30,676 --> 00:17:33,145
You said it loud enough.
We're not deaf.

298
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,513
- Where's the spare?
- On top.

299
00:17:34,548 --> 00:17:35,138
Come on.

300
00:18:04,743 --> 00:18:07,179
Things can't go on
like this forever, and...

301
00:18:07,214 --> 00:18:08,946
...when my situation changes...

302
00:18:08,981 --> 00:18:10,516
...if there's anything
I can do for you...

303
00:18:10,551 --> 00:18:12,885
I heard you'll be appointed judge.

304
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,218
In a matter of days.

305
00:18:14,253 --> 00:18:16,186
Despite my forlorn appearance...

306
00:18:16,221 --> 00:18:18,088
...the governor is a friend of mine...

307
00:18:18,123 --> 00:18:21,894
...and the president studied
with a friend's friend.

308
00:18:21,929 --> 00:18:23,156
Oh, that's good.

309
00:18:23,529 --> 00:18:24,996
Here, let me light it for you.

310
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:28,932
Why let a cigarette go out?

311
00:18:28,967 --> 00:18:31,336
To get some courtesy back, doll.

312
00:18:31,371 --> 00:18:32,769
Do you want to put it out?

313
00:18:34,306 --> 00:18:37,070
Patience, you'll be back in time.

314
00:18:38,043 --> 00:18:39,676
Perhaps, but it's so slow.

315
00:18:39,711 --> 00:18:42,112
A slow stride is
better than a tiring one.

316
00:18:42,147 --> 00:18:45,633
- If I were the driver...
- You'd crash the bus.

317
00:18:45,668 --> 00:18:49,119
Look at those curves, you
always lose control there.

318
00:19:01,133 --> 00:19:03,352
Since when?
I'm not a handle.

319
00:19:03,387 --> 00:19:05,536
It's all I can hold on to.

320
00:19:05,571 --> 00:19:07,639
You're used to being supported.

321
00:19:07,674 --> 00:19:09,708
Slopes frighten me, you see.

322
00:19:09,743 --> 00:19:11,208
Back off, back off.

323
00:19:11,243 --> 00:19:13,507
Buy yourself a scapular.

324
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:36,735
The fog looks like cotton.

325
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:37,634
Look.

326
00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:40,839
The Congressman feels
safer beside Silvestre.

327
00:19:40,874 --> 00:19:42,608
You don't feel well, do you?

328
00:19:42,643 --> 00:19:44,269
I'm already sick.

329
00:19:44,876 --> 00:19:46,241
Look out for that pothole.

330
00:19:46,612 --> 00:19:49,137
You think I'm not looking.

331
00:19:51,783 --> 00:19:53,250
That rock!

332
00:19:53,285 --> 00:19:54,484
I told you, you fool.

333
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:56,620
Don't bother me, it's distracting.

334
00:19:56,655 --> 00:20:00,421
Too many people in the kitchen
spoil the pan of chicken.

335
00:20:03,929 --> 00:20:05,797
If it weren't for this wooden leg...

336
00:20:05,832 --> 00:20:07,064
...I would be walking by now.

337
00:20:07,099 --> 00:20:09,401
And the little angels
are so quiet.

338
00:20:09,436 --> 00:20:11,369
Such innocence.

339
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,815
Move your arm, I can't drive.

340
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:25,950
Careful, please be careful.

341
00:20:26,184 --> 00:20:28,353
You'd better stop
until the fog clears up.

342
00:20:28,388 --> 00:20:29,786
We'd lose more time.

343
00:20:29,821 --> 00:20:31,311
Others are in a hurry, too.

344
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:33,323
He keeps bothering me!

345
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:34,848
We all need to get there fast.

346
00:20:36,662 --> 00:20:37,890
It hurts a lot, doesn't it?

347
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:39,597
I feel terrible.

348
00:20:40,265 --> 00:20:42,062
You should have come sooner.

349
00:20:42,634 --> 00:20:44,335
I think it's close.

350
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:46,036
Calm down, calm down.

351
00:20:48,173 --> 00:20:51,734
Now we're in for it,
here comes another car.

352
00:20:56,281 --> 00:20:59,351
Almonds, sugar coated peanuts,
candy and chewing gum.

353
00:20:59,386 --> 00:21:01,318
- Like this, mother?
- Be quiet.

354
00:21:01,353 --> 00:21:04,186
- Watch out.
- I couldn't be more careful.

355
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,469
Please, back up.
We're in a hurry.

356
00:21:17,504 --> 00:21:18,704
Hey buddy, back up.

357
00:21:18,739 --> 00:21:19,536
Let's go.

358
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:21,738
I'd like to sir, but I can't.

359
00:21:21,773 --> 00:21:23,241
- My reverse doesn't work.
- What?

360
00:21:23,276 --> 00:21:24,441
Back up or I'll make you.

361
00:21:24,476 --> 00:21:26,944
This junk couldn't even be towed.

362
00:21:27,212 --> 00:21:28,201
Let's see.

363
00:21:28,613 --> 00:21:30,205
All right, let's go.

364
00:21:30,649 --> 00:21:31,547
Pull.

365
00:21:33,118 --> 00:21:35,120
Harder on reverse.

366
00:21:35,155 --> 00:21:36,586
Harder, man.

367
00:21:36,621 --> 00:21:38,106
We need a pulley.

368
00:21:38,141 --> 00:21:39,556
Yes, Congressman.

369
00:21:39,591 --> 00:21:41,258
I'm familiar with this.

370
00:21:41,293 --> 00:21:42,761
Back up, and it'll be solved.

371
00:21:42,796 --> 00:21:44,729
Look, Mr. Eladio.

372
00:21:49,835 --> 00:21:51,653
Fidencio, wait. Let's get off.

373
00:21:51,688 --> 00:21:53,437
No, I don't want to. Stop it.

374
00:21:53,472 --> 00:21:55,090
You pig. You're always sniffling...

375
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:56,708
...but never blow your nose. Creep.

376
00:21:56,743 --> 00:21:58,869
<i>Gross,</i> snot.

377
00:22:01,179 --> 00:22:02,379
Oh, my, what happened?

378
00:22:02,414 --> 00:22:04,583
Silvestre, get off and take the kids.

379
00:22:04,618 --> 00:22:06,752
Call some women to help with Feliza.

380
00:22:06,787 --> 00:22:08,418
Go on, hurry.

381
00:22:08,453 --> 00:22:10,421
Turn around, don't look.

382
00:22:18,029 --> 00:22:19,847
Women! I need two.

383
00:22:19,882 --> 00:22:21,631
Hurry, quickly.

384
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:23,968
- They're coming.
- Hurry.

385
00:22:24,003 --> 00:22:26,270
Come on, I'll take you.

386
00:22:27,639 --> 00:22:29,440
What do you need?

387
00:22:29,475 --> 00:22:31,242
Get in, no questions.

388
00:22:33,111 --> 00:22:33,873
Come on.

389
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,449
This happened to
me years ago...

390
00:22:37,484 --> 00:22:39,383
...on a boat, and I'm fine.

391
00:22:39,684 --> 00:22:41,849
Hurry. Don't just stand there.

392
00:22:41,884 --> 00:22:44,014
And don't let any men in here.

393
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:51,122
- Move, I'm going in.
- You can't.

394
00:22:51,263 --> 00:22:53,698
It's the honey,
I need to wash it down.

395
00:22:53,733 --> 00:22:55,359
I need my bottle.

396
00:22:57,302 --> 00:22:59,903
No, you son of a...

397
00:22:59,938 --> 00:23:02,133
- Oh, Oliverio, Oliverio.
- What?

398
00:23:02,908 --> 00:23:04,535
Look...

399
00:23:05,444 --> 00:23:06,410
- Really?
- Yes.

400
00:23:06,445 --> 00:23:08,777
I'm sorry. I'll see what I can do.

401
00:23:09,514 --> 00:23:11,014
Do you know what's going on?

402
00:23:11,049 --> 00:23:13,385
We don't have a place for the show.

403
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,785
Too bad, find a way.

404
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,922
We made the trip, it's too late.

405
00:23:16,957 --> 00:23:19,015
Ma'am, everything is fine.

406
00:23:19,124 --> 00:23:20,759
- Do you want to come?
- Heavens.

407
00:23:20,794 --> 00:23:22,528
Mother, let me see it.

408
00:23:22,563 --> 00:23:24,463
Stay right here, girl.

409
00:23:24,498 --> 00:23:26,329
- Stay here.
- Oh, child.

410
00:23:26,364 --> 00:23:28,559
What are you up to,
pretty little bud?

411
00:23:28,834 --> 00:23:30,268
I'm taking this to Feliza.

412
00:23:30,303 --> 00:23:31,703
Don't let her mistreat you.

413
00:23:31,738 --> 00:23:33,036
Don't get burnt.

414
00:23:33,071 --> 00:23:35,801
- What if I do?
- You'll burn me, too.

415
00:23:36,241 --> 00:23:38,109
You've got experience, child.

416
00:23:38,144 --> 00:23:39,474
Experience?

417
00:23:39,778 --> 00:23:42,076
You bet. Do you want to try?

418
00:23:43,448 --> 00:23:46,051
I'm burning for you,
and you're so evasive.

419
00:23:46,086 --> 00:23:47,643
Put some time aside for me.

420
00:23:47,819 --> 00:23:49,871
Those squeaking doors.

421
00:23:49,906 --> 00:23:51,888
Get someone to oil them.

422
00:23:51,923 --> 00:23:54,289
- I think it was a boy.
- A boy?

423
00:23:54,826 --> 00:23:56,560
It's a boy, it's a boy.

424
00:23:56,595 --> 00:23:59,029
It's about time, so many girls.

425
00:23:59,564 --> 00:24:01,691
I'm going to cry my eyes out.

426
00:24:02,067 --> 00:24:04,502
Hospitals with all their staff...

427
00:24:04,537 --> 00:24:06,738
...can't pick flowers like this.

428
00:24:06,773 --> 00:24:08,940
- How's the mother?
- Just fine.

429
00:24:08,975 --> 00:24:10,907
She just wants to go home.

430
00:24:10,942 --> 00:24:12,878
Tell the men to climb on board...

431
00:24:12,913 --> 00:24:14,311
...to help her get off.

432
00:24:14,346 --> 00:24:16,181
He sure is cute, look at that...

433
00:24:16,216 --> 00:24:17,547
He's so cute.

434
00:24:17,582 --> 00:24:20,450
He's cute, isn't he?

435
00:24:20,485 --> 00:24:22,316
Silvestre, I'm helping too.

436
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,454
- She's heavy.
- Come on, come on.

437
00:24:24,489 --> 00:24:27,117
- Help me, Silvestre.
- Yes, Oliverio, let's see.

438
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:29,561
Be careful. Get a good
grip on her shoulders.

439
00:24:29,596 --> 00:24:31,963
- Slowly.
- I'll hold her legs.

440
00:24:31,998 --> 00:24:33,298
- Come on.
- Careful.

441
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:34,464
We'll take her.

442
00:24:34,499 --> 00:24:37,535
We'll try to make her
as comfortable as possible.

443
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:40,572
Marta, Marta, get out
so the lady is comfortable.

444
00:24:40,607 --> 00:24:42,991
The baby's father will be thrilled...

445
00:24:43,026 --> 00:24:45,376
...when he gets back from the mine.

446
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:48,308
Imagine when Albina
surprises you like this?

447
00:24:48,813 --> 00:24:50,313
Bring me my son.

448
00:24:50,348 --> 00:24:52,050
- Mrs. Linda, bring me the boy.
- My son.

449
00:24:52,085 --> 00:24:53,574
Cover him up, he'll get sick.

450
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,956
Give him to his mother.

451
00:24:57,991 --> 00:24:59,218
Congratulations.

452
00:24:59,491 --> 00:25:01,220
Give me those boxes, girl.

453
00:25:01,459 --> 00:25:02,721
Where's the blanket?

454
00:25:02,827 --> 00:25:04,522
Let's see that smile.

455
00:25:04,629 --> 00:25:06,096
Congratulations.

456
00:25:06,565 --> 00:25:08,149
I'd love to be his godfather.

457
00:25:08,184 --> 00:25:10,043
I have lots of godchildren.

458
00:25:10,078 --> 00:25:12,025
But he will be my favorite.

459
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,817
I want to see the cutie.

460
00:25:13,852 --> 00:25:15,697
Move. Don't pester the lady.

461
00:25:15,732 --> 00:25:17,542
- He has hair, look.
- Thanks.

462
00:25:17,742 --> 00:25:19,309
Isn't he just like his father?

463
00:25:19,344 --> 00:25:21,539
Tough luck. You're
as ugly as him.

464
00:25:21,846 --> 00:25:23,897
Let's go, it's getting late.

465
00:25:23,932 --> 00:25:25,949
Take care of him, he's lovely.

466
00:25:26,251 --> 00:25:27,452
- Shut the door.
- I'm going to cover him.

467
00:25:27,487 --> 00:25:28,282
Yes.

468
00:25:28,954 --> 00:25:30,581
Get in, it's getting late.

469
00:25:58,683 --> 00:25:59,649
What did I say?

470
00:25:59,684 --> 00:26:01,418
See how fluid it is now?

471
00:26:01,453 --> 00:26:03,755
Yes, but you can't deny
there was an accident.

472
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:07,191
Sure, but in exchange
of a new life.

473
00:26:07,592 --> 00:26:08,858
Huh, boy.

474
00:26:08,893 --> 00:26:10,861
Cheer up, everything will be fine.

475
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:13,497
The rain didn't fill the river.

476
00:26:26,111 --> 00:26:28,224
We'll never get ahead like this.

477
00:26:28,259 --> 00:26:30,338
Animals and people together.

478
00:26:30,615 --> 00:26:32,650
- How nice.
- This is a drag.

479
00:26:32,685 --> 00:26:34,651
Civilization. I don't understand.

480
00:26:34,686 --> 00:26:37,922
We have a right to use
public services no matter what.

481
00:26:37,957 --> 00:26:38,752
It's mine.

482
00:26:38,857 --> 00:26:40,552
- Hit him, get him.
- It's mine.

483
00:26:40,959 --> 00:26:43,261
Enough, stop fighting.

484
00:26:43,296 --> 00:26:44,396
Get out of here.

485
00:26:44,431 --> 00:26:45,658
Damn it.

486
00:26:46,097 --> 00:26:48,800
Stay still, you're acting
like chili peppers.

487
00:26:48,835 --> 00:26:51,036
Now you're really going to get it.

488
00:26:51,071 --> 00:26:53,138
What if you had broken my leg?

489
00:26:53,173 --> 00:26:55,206
- So what?
- I'd be worse off.

490
00:26:55,974 --> 00:26:57,409
Well, you could buy another one.

491
00:26:57,444 --> 00:26:59,138
Settle down, settle down.

492
00:27:23,168 --> 00:27:25,437
Let's see what your
godfather brought you.

493
00:27:25,472 --> 00:27:26,665
Godfather.

494
00:27:46,491 --> 00:27:47,981
Again<i>, compadre.</i>

495
00:27:48,393 --> 00:27:50,384
That's what we're here for.

496
00:27:51,863 --> 00:27:52,955
What happened?

497
00:27:53,498 --> 00:27:55,591
It's like with the slippers.

498
00:27:55,834 --> 00:27:57,869
They get their feet wet
before the dance.

499
00:27:57,904 --> 00:27:58,995
Why won't it start?

500
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,765
I'll take a look, must be the rocks.

501
00:28:07,145 --> 00:28:08,203
Come on, Mr. Pedro.

502
00:28:09,547 --> 00:28:12,209
Help that man who fell.

503
00:28:30,401 --> 00:28:32,392
You're filthy,
you need a bath.

504
00:28:32,637 --> 00:28:34,628
Let's take a dip in that pond.

505
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:37,098
I think I could use it, I'm coming.

506
00:28:37,275 --> 00:28:38,367
Don't worry.

507
00:28:38,443 --> 00:28:41,537
We'll get the bus out
thanks to my <i>compadre.</i>

508
00:28:42,714 --> 00:28:46,241
This darn bus is like a pig
it loves mud.

509
00:28:46,618 --> 00:28:47,350
Don't get mad.

510
00:28:47,385 --> 00:28:49,717
Let's take a dip, you'll relax.

511
00:28:50,622 --> 00:28:52,249
I understand that you're sad.

512
00:28:52,457 --> 00:28:53,656
Poor thing.

513
00:28:53,691 --> 00:28:55,386
Married and single.

514
00:28:55,493 --> 00:28:56,893
I don't need your pity.

515
00:28:56,928 --> 00:28:58,542
Sure. Albina is very pretty...

516
00:28:58,577 --> 00:29:00,157
...but she isn't with you.

517
00:29:00,431 --> 00:29:02,592
That's why I want to go back.

518
00:29:02,734 --> 00:29:04,803
Come on, don't play hard to get.

519
00:29:04,838 --> 00:29:05,770
Come on.

520
00:29:07,639 --> 00:29:08,731
<i>... has skinny legs...</i>

521
00:29:13,278 --> 00:29:14,043
<i>Lorenza</i>

522
00:29:14,078 --> 00:29:15,943
<i>... but pull the bus out first.</i>

523
00:29:20,418 --> 00:29:21,077
<i>Lorenza</i>

524
00:29:21,152 --> 00:29:23,177
<i>... but pull the bus out first.</i>

525
00:29:30,995 --> 00:29:33,180
Animal traction is obsolete.

526
00:29:33,215 --> 00:29:35,366
We're an industrialized country.

527
00:29:35,401 --> 00:29:36,526
Look over there.

528
00:29:38,736 --> 00:29:40,972
My train of oxen can
pull it out, Mr. Eladio.

529
00:29:41,007 --> 00:29:42,071
Why go so far?

530
00:29:42,106 --> 00:29:43,539
You're all so close-minded.

531
00:29:43,608 --> 00:29:45,542
- Enemies of progress.
- Yes, Mr. Eladio.

532
00:29:45,577 --> 00:29:48,011
- The oxen are too slow.
- Yeah, but they're sure.

533
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:50,272
- I'll get the tractor.
- Go on.

534
00:30:16,708 --> 00:30:18,369
Tell me, do you dislike me?

535
00:30:18,476 --> 00:30:19,342
No, why?

536
00:30:19,377 --> 00:30:22,146
Because you act
like you don't know me.

537
00:30:22,181 --> 00:30:23,408
I'm treating you as always.

538
00:30:23,514 --> 00:30:26,176
Yeah, but now we're not as always.

539
00:30:27,018 --> 00:30:28,852
Oh, you're so faithful.

540
00:30:28,887 --> 00:30:31,256
Poor Albina, she has no
idea who she married.

541
00:30:31,291 --> 00:30:33,342
It seems you don't either.

542
00:30:33,377 --> 00:30:34,931
What's wrong with her?

543
00:30:34,966 --> 00:30:36,485
It's not about her.

544
00:30:36,761 --> 00:30:37,853
It's about you.

545
00:30:39,197 --> 00:30:39,891
<i>Pull that.</i>

546
00:30:41,499 --> 00:30:42,298
Up.

547
00:30:42,333 --> 00:30:43,835
- Pull.
- Harder.

548
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:45,029
Pull that.

549
00:30:56,848 --> 00:30:58,950
Come on, you bum, push.
Stop loafing around.

550
00:30:58,985 --> 00:31:01,680
You do it, if you're so savvy.

551
00:31:08,192 --> 00:31:09,022
<i>Stop loafing around.</i>

552
00:31:13,932 --> 00:31:15,194
<i>I'll be dog-gone.</i>

553
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,761
Now Mr. Eladio's really done it.

554
00:31:21,506 --> 00:31:23,706
Second gear, to your left.

555
00:31:23,741 --> 00:31:25,944
Leave me alone,
I know what I'm doing.

556
00:31:25,979 --> 00:31:27,571
Not by the edge.

557
00:31:28,146 --> 00:31:29,738
Not by the edge, you dunce.

558
00:31:30,848 --> 00:31:33,418
I told you to move
to the left, stupid.

559
00:31:33,453 --> 00:31:35,682
All right, to the left it is.

560
00:31:38,656 --> 00:31:40,458
This politician is a show-off.

561
00:31:40,493 --> 00:31:42,619
Always fussing about.

562
00:31:42,927 --> 00:31:44,627
Back up.

563
00:31:44,662 --> 00:31:46,362
I'll be damned, man.

564
00:31:46,397 --> 00:31:49,299
If those are his speeches,
he's sure to win.

565
00:31:49,334 --> 00:31:52,202
Thought it was easy to
do two things at a time.

566
00:31:53,538 --> 00:31:54,937
We're stuck.

567
00:31:55,406 --> 00:31:56,930
Look at the bus.

568
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:14,759
She manipulates others
besides her father.

569
00:32:14,794 --> 00:32:15,858
Give me those cheeks.

570
00:32:15,893 --> 00:32:17,895
That's why I'm your godfather.

571
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:19,729
Close-minded nitwits.

572
00:32:19,764 --> 00:32:22,430
The animal traction
got tired and left.

573
00:32:22,465 --> 00:32:25,096
Let's go, Silvestre.
Please, it's late.

574
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:26,994
Let's all go.

575
00:32:30,742 --> 00:32:31,504
Hey.

576
00:32:32,477 --> 00:32:33,142
Hey.

577
00:32:33,177 --> 00:32:34,512
Don't forget about me.

578
00:32:34,547 --> 00:32:36,480
It had to be you.

579
00:32:37,348 --> 00:32:39,316
Did you want to leave me here?

580
00:32:39,717 --> 00:32:42,320
Oh, you're such a nuisance,
what a pest.

581
00:32:42,355 --> 00:32:43,653
Not a pest.

582
00:32:43,688 --> 00:32:46,555
- More like a plant.
- No wonder you want to grow roots.

583
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:34,142
Were you thinking of me?

584
00:36:59,844 --> 00:37:01,436
Pay up, Rosalio.

585
00:37:03,014 --> 00:37:05,549
I may have <i>dough,</i> but
I'm not your relative.

586
00:37:05,584 --> 00:37:06,249
What?

587
00:37:06,284 --> 00:37:09,420
I'll ask you when
I hang my hat on them.

588
00:37:09,455 --> 00:37:12,014
You think everyone's like you.

589
00:37:15,593 --> 00:37:16,651
The guy at the wheel.

590
00:37:16,794 --> 00:37:17,920
To the crossroads.

591
00:37:17,995 --> 00:37:19,529
Are you selling chickens?

592
00:37:19,564 --> 00:37:21,063
Not ordinary livestock.

593
00:37:21,198 --> 00:37:22,315
I only deal Legore...

594
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:23,433
...Rhode Island...

595
00:37:23,567 --> 00:37:24,967
...and others from my catalogue.

596
00:37:25,002 --> 00:37:27,937
Tell me when you have
feathers for my mattress.

597
00:37:28,472 --> 00:37:30,274
Silvestre, it's late, let's go.

598
00:37:30,309 --> 00:37:31,502
Come on, let's.

599
00:37:31,642 --> 00:37:33,633
Let's all climb on the bus.

600
00:37:46,457 --> 00:37:48,482
Mother, at least give me some bread.

601
00:37:48,592 --> 00:37:51,562
- I knew you had some.
- Stop pestering.

602
00:37:51,597 --> 00:37:54,265
- Do you want a bite?
- No, thanks.

603
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,665
Well.

604
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:58,569
- You sound like a...
- Spaniard, from Madrid. Mr...

605
00:37:58,604 --> 00:38:01,122
Nemesio Alvarez y Villalbazo,
at your service.

606
00:38:01,157 --> 00:38:03,641
- Miguel Suarez, at your service.
- Pleasure.

607
00:38:03,676 --> 00:38:05,943
- What do you do?
- I sell hens.

608
00:38:05,978 --> 00:38:07,545
- Where are they?
- Here.

609
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:08,477
Right here?

610
00:38:08,512 --> 00:38:11,414
It's cheaper than cages.

611
00:38:11,449 --> 00:38:13,417
Those are some nice looking hens.

612
00:38:13,584 --> 00:38:14,516
Are they expensive?

613
00:38:14,618 --> 00:38:16,952
Well, they yield a lot.

614
00:38:16,987 --> 00:38:19,423
There's no better business
than a hen farm.

615
00:38:19,458 --> 00:38:20,923
If you're interested.

616
00:38:20,958 --> 00:38:24,860
As long as I'm not done
justice and recover my land...

617
00:38:25,329 --> 00:38:26,557
...I can't think of it.

618
00:39:04,502 --> 00:39:05,491
Oh, man.

619
00:39:06,237 --> 00:39:08,102
They may think I'm lazy.

620
00:39:08,472 --> 00:39:11,100
If I don't get some sleep,
we'll be dead.

621
00:39:11,642 --> 00:39:13,878
Don't worry,
I'll sleep on the luggage.

622
00:39:13,913 --> 00:39:14,503
Stop loafing around.

623
00:39:14,979 --> 00:39:16,571
I have to be in Petatlan early.

624
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,647
You said we'd make it on time...

625
00:39:18,682 --> 00:39:20,547
...to catch the bus
to Chilpancingo.

626
00:39:20,618 --> 00:39:22,176
I can't stand it anymore.

627
00:39:22,353 --> 00:39:24,412
Let me drive, I'm not sleepy.

628
00:39:24,588 --> 00:39:25,452
Whatever.

629
00:39:25,689 --> 00:39:27,281
I'm going to sleep.

630
00:39:32,296 --> 00:39:33,763
If it weren't for you...

631
00:39:34,165 --> 00:39:35,564
...what a country this would be.

632
00:39:35,633 --> 00:39:37,692
Everybody doing their own will.

633
00:39:37,835 --> 00:39:39,530
No wonder we don't get ahead.

634
00:39:39,703 --> 00:39:40,965
I'm going to file a complaint.

635
00:39:41,138 --> 00:39:44,173
This man here is the
complaining kind.

636
00:39:44,208 --> 00:39:46,575
And he hasn't confronted
real problems yet.

637
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:49,747
Always among hens, all he
does is cluck and complain.

638
00:39:49,782 --> 00:39:50,679
Yes, but like a rooster.

639
00:39:50,714 --> 00:39:52,716
People like you are our doom.

640
00:39:52,751 --> 00:39:54,377
Mom, look at him snore.

641
00:39:54,485 --> 00:39:56,385
He even whistles.

642
00:39:56,587 --> 00:39:57,968
Like a train, huh?

643
00:39:58,003 --> 00:39:59,350
Yes, son. Come here.

644
00:40:40,064 --> 00:40:41,565
Good morning.

645
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,032
Good morning.

646
00:40:43,067 --> 00:40:46,059
Look at her twisting
like a caterpillar.

647
00:40:46,604 --> 00:40:48,170
Move. Give me that.

648
00:40:48,205 --> 00:40:49,738
If you broke my mirror...

649
00:40:49,773 --> 00:40:51,558
...with all that bouncing around...

650
00:40:51,593 --> 00:40:53,343
...you won't live to tell about it.

651
00:40:53,444 --> 00:40:55,605
Heavenly Jesus.
What a life, brother.

652
00:40:55,846 --> 00:40:57,006
They pay you for sleeping.

653
00:40:57,248 --> 00:40:59,409
Would you like your chocolate, sir?

654
00:40:59,517 --> 00:41:01,217
I can see Petatlan.

655
00:41:01,252 --> 00:41:02,987
Who said we're going to Petatlan?

656
00:41:03,022 --> 00:41:04,655
Aren't we going to Petatlan?

657
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:06,055
Yes, we are.

658
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:08,357
But first, we'll drop by my...

659
00:41:08,392 --> 00:41:10,594
...mother's ranch in time
to serenade her.

660
00:41:10,629 --> 00:41:12,130
Today's her birthday.

661
00:41:12,165 --> 00:41:13,596
Everyone's invited.

662
00:41:13,631 --> 00:41:15,360
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

663
00:41:16,233 --> 00:41:20,583
<i>Happy birthday to you...</i>

664
00:41:20,618 --> 00:41:24,934
<i>... happy birthday to you...</i>

665
00:41:25,109 --> 00:41:29,011
<i>... we've come to sing...</i>

666
00:41:29,046 --> 00:41:33,039
<i>... to beautiful girls like you.</i>

667
00:41:33,384 --> 00:41:37,219
<i>Wake up, dear, wake up</i>

668
00:41:37,254 --> 00:41:40,190
<i>- The sun has risen.</i>
- Sorry, man.

669
00:41:40,225 --> 00:41:41,790
But what would you do if...

670
00:41:41,825 --> 00:41:43,960
...it were your mother's birthday?

671
00:41:43,995 --> 00:41:46,096
I don't know, my mother is dying.

672
00:41:46,131 --> 00:41:47,963
Don't get depressed.

673
00:41:47,998 --> 00:41:49,863
Even if you arrive early, you...

674
00:41:49,967 --> 00:41:52,367
...can't return to San Jeronimito today.

675
00:41:52,503 --> 00:41:54,838
Besides, the lawyer
won't even be up yet.

676
00:41:54,873 --> 00:41:57,398
There's a motorcycle waiting for me.

677
00:41:57,474 --> 00:42:00,068
Just a few yards
from my mother's house.

678
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:03,247
I hope nobody leaves
without toasting for her.

679
00:42:03,282 --> 00:42:04,839
We'll be delighted.

680
00:42:05,215 --> 00:42:06,933
What's your mother like?

681
00:42:06,968 --> 00:42:08,652
She's a true beauty.

682
00:42:12,056 --> 00:42:15,890
<i>Happy birthday to you...</i>

683
00:42:16,493 --> 00:42:20,327
<i>... happy birthday to you...</i>

684
00:42:21,065 --> 00:42:24,068
You know I wish for
you the best, mother.

685
00:42:24,103 --> 00:42:25,367
Thank you, dear.

686
00:42:25,402 --> 00:42:26,664
Did you hear, mother?

687
00:42:26,804 --> 00:42:29,038
Get up, today's a great day.

688
00:42:29,073 --> 00:42:31,241
The only day I can't get up early.

689
00:42:31,276 --> 00:42:32,876
<i>... wake up, dear...</i>

690
00:42:32,911 --> 00:42:34,275
There's Silvestre.

691
00:42:34,945 --> 00:42:36,913
I have to pretend I'm asleep.

692
00:42:37,081 --> 00:42:41,081
<i>... the birds are chirping...</i>

693
00:42:41,116 --> 00:42:45,081
<i>... and the moon has risen.</i>

694
00:42:45,422 --> 00:42:48,949
<i>What a beautiful morning...</i>

695
00:42:49,226 --> 00:42:52,029
Open up, here is my
loving mother's son...

696
00:42:52,064 --> 00:42:54,031
- Come on.
- Oh, Silvestre, my son.

697
00:42:54,066 --> 00:42:55,862
Heavens. Oh.

698
00:42:56,333 --> 00:42:58,801
You're tearing me apart, boy.

699
00:43:00,804 --> 00:43:02,829
I'm starving.

700
00:43:03,073 --> 00:43:05,473
As idle and glutton as always.

701
00:43:05,576 --> 00:43:06,304
Mother.

702
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:08,846
My passengers are
going to accompany us.

703
00:43:08,881 --> 00:43:11,076
Come here. Come in.

704
00:43:12,216 --> 00:43:15,083
Ma'am, accept my most
sincere congratulations.

705
00:43:15,252 --> 00:43:16,844
Pleased to meet you...

706
00:43:17,087 --> 00:43:18,722
...and honored by the invitation.

707
00:43:18,757 --> 00:43:20,422
Mother, Mr. Eladio...

708
00:43:20,457 --> 00:43:22,254
...is our candidate for Congress.

709
00:43:22,359 --> 00:43:23,425
Thank you so much.

710
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:25,342
The table is served. Come in.

711
00:43:25,377 --> 00:43:27,224
- Sit down.
- Thank you, ma'am.

712
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:31,590
You better behave.

713
00:43:33,237 --> 00:43:35,899
- Grandfather.
- My darling.

714
00:43:36,874 --> 00:43:38,642
You must be dying to be together...

715
00:43:38,677 --> 00:43:40,609
...after so many days apart.

716
00:43:40,644 --> 00:43:43,511
- How have you been, Mr. Nemesio?
- Fine, Mrs. Tita.

717
00:43:43,881 --> 00:43:46,416
Many happy returns.
With our best wishes.

718
00:43:46,451 --> 00:43:48,952
- Thank you.
- Chocolate, Mr. Nemesio.

719
00:43:48,987 --> 00:43:50,954
Don't trouble yourselves, Justina.

720
00:43:50,989 --> 00:43:53,290
Don't be shy, don't be shy.

721
00:43:53,325 --> 00:43:54,690
Tend to them, Justina.

722
00:43:54,725 --> 00:43:56,827
A table for you and your girl.

723
00:43:56,862 --> 00:43:58,317
Come, this way.

724
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,135
Have a nice day, Mrs. Sixta.

725
00:44:05,170 --> 00:44:06,363
Thank you, sonny.

726
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:08,665
- How's your mother?
- Very ill when I left.

727
00:44:08,772 --> 00:44:10,541
I may not see her alive again.

728
00:44:10,576 --> 00:44:12,307
God willing, you will...

729
00:44:12,342 --> 00:44:13,977
...and she will soon get well, son.

730
00:44:14,012 --> 00:44:15,678
The chocolate is getting cold.

731
00:44:15,713 --> 00:44:18,649
- Please sit down.
- Yes, please sit.

732
00:44:18,684 --> 00:44:20,918
Please sit down.
Sit down, son.

733
00:44:20,953 --> 00:44:23,153
- Will you come here?
- Sit there.

734
00:44:23,987 --> 00:44:25,284
Move that hat.

735
00:44:29,693 --> 00:44:32,218
Thank you, but this chair
is too low for me.

736
00:44:32,329 --> 00:44:34,923
I'd rather sit between two thorns.

737
00:44:35,265 --> 00:44:36,532
Don't compare me.

738
00:44:36,567 --> 00:44:39,236
I'm thorn enough to poke
whoever bothers you, love.

739
00:44:39,271 --> 00:44:41,605
- You took the biggest one.
- It's mine.

740
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,707
Did I teach you those manners?

741
00:44:43,742 --> 00:44:45,334
Calm down, there's more.

742
00:44:45,642 --> 00:44:46,768
I'll be.

743
00:44:47,845 --> 00:44:48,869
Carmelita...

744
00:44:49,012 --> 00:44:51,003
...I asked you to behave.

745
00:44:51,148 --> 00:44:52,308
Don't dip it.

746
00:44:52,416 --> 00:44:54,752
We're among family, granddaddy.

747
00:44:54,787 --> 00:44:56,151
That's precisely why.

748
00:44:56,186 --> 00:44:59,713
Out of respect to this house
and their kindness...

749
00:44:59,823 --> 00:45:01,723
...I want you to behave.

750
00:45:03,127 --> 00:45:05,618
Don't take this.
Oh, thanks.

751
00:45:06,263 --> 00:45:07,663
Where are you.

752
00:45:07,698 --> 00:45:10,200
Quiet. We want to hear
the congressman speak.

753
00:45:10,235 --> 00:45:11,895
- Speak.
- Yes, speak.

754
00:45:15,506 --> 00:45:17,269
In the history of all peoples...

755
00:45:17,541 --> 00:45:20,032
...mothers have always
occupied the first place.

756
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:22,813
Nobody knows who came first.

757
00:45:22,848 --> 00:45:24,110
The chicken or the egg.

758
00:45:24,214 --> 00:45:25,875
The agent can tell us that.

759
00:45:25,983 --> 00:45:27,015
Young man...

760
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:29,135
...just because I sell them...

761
00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:31,221
...it doesn't mean I'm a chicken.

762
00:45:31,256 --> 00:45:32,221
I'm serious.

763
00:45:32,256 --> 00:45:33,917
Excuse the interruption.

764
00:45:34,291 --> 00:45:35,451
Continue, madam.

765
00:45:35,592 --> 00:45:37,659
It's moving to see this example...

766
00:45:37,694 --> 00:45:40,629
...which should be the reflection
of every good child.

767
00:45:40,864 --> 00:45:43,560
So, in memory of my beloved mother...

768
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:45,467
...and of yours, if you'll allow me...

769
00:45:45,502 --> 00:45:47,766
...as well as in honor
of the birthday girl...

770
00:45:47,871 --> 00:45:50,472
...Id like to pick the
petals of the anthology...

771
00:45:50,507 --> 00:45:53,704
...threaded by the lucid
and distinguished conception...

772
00:45:53,844 --> 00:45:56,210
...of this great bard,
Pepe Radilla...

773
00:45:56,313 --> 00:45:59,407
...tireless glory of
contemporary literature...

774
00:45:59,483 --> 00:46:01,542
...and radiant sun of our state.

775
00:46:01,652 --> 00:46:03,418
This is getting sour.

776
00:46:03,453 --> 00:46:06,423
If I weren't decent and didn't
respect where I am...

777
00:46:06,458 --> 00:46:09,393
...and the date we're celebrating,
my dear cripple...

778
00:46:09,428 --> 00:46:12,089
...Id be stirring your
curdled milk by now.

779
00:46:47,364 --> 00:46:50,167

...a typical little Mexican ranch.

800

00:48:25,963 --> 00:48:27,798
Aren't you happy with Jeronimito?

814
00:48:27,833 --> 00:48:29,533
I'll bet my name on it.

815
00:48:29,568 --> 00:48:31,160
All right, people.

816
00:48:37,741 --> 00:48:38,607
Tough luck.

00:48:38,642 --> 00:48:40,377
- Make yourselves at home.
- Thank you.

818
00:48:40,412 --> 00:48:41,643
Excuse me.

819
00:48:41,678 --> 00:48:43,292
Make yourselves at home.

820
00:48:43,327 --> 00:48:44,907
<i>Mr. Johns, come on.</i>

821
00:49:01,965 --> 00:49:04,818
<i>I'm not from San Marcos</i>

822
00:49:04,853 --> 00:49:07,446
<i>I'm from San Jeronimito</i>

823
00:49:07,481 --> 00:49:10,228
<i>I'm not from San Marcos</i>

824
00:49:10,263 --> 00:49:13,138
<i>I'm from San Jeronimito</i>

825
00:49:13,173 --> 00:49:15,978
<i>Tell me, any one of you</i>

826
00:49:16,013 --> 00:49:18,080
<i>If you've seen prettier eyes</i>

827
00:49:18,115 --> 00:49:23,610
<i>Beloved woman of San Marcos,</i>
<i>lovely woman of san Marcos</i>

828
00:49:40,771 --> 00:49:41,636
Mr. Eladio...

829
00:49:41,671 --> 00:49:43,407
Keep an eye on your little chick.

830
00:49:43,442 --> 00:49:44,892
Somebody may steal her away.

831
00:49:44,927 --> 00:49:46,343
They would if they could.

832
00:49:46,378 --> 00:49:47,833
Here comes my trine.

833
00:49:52,649 --> 00:49:54,985
<i>Not only the women of San Marcos</i>

834
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:58,020
<i>Are pretty and lovely</i>

835
00:49:58,055 --> 00:50:00,524
<i>Not only the women of San Marcos</i>

836
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:03,592
<i>Are pretty and lovely</i>

837
00:50:03,627 --> 00:50:06,494
Carmelita, take your
elbows off the table.

838
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:07,494
And eat slowly.

839
00:50:07,564 --> 00:50:10,032
Don't stuff your face,
it's bad manners.

840
00:50:10,434 --> 00:50:12,235
Were you well tended, Mr. Nemesio?

841
00:50:12,270 --> 00:50:14,137
Service was great, Mrs. Sixta.

842
00:50:14,172 --> 00:50:16,005
Just like every time I come.

843
00:50:16,173 --> 00:50:19,342
Do you know when Silvestre
is returning?

844
00:50:19,377 --> 00:50:21,645
Tomorrow, I suppose. Today...

845
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:22,811
That's too bad.

846
00:50:22,846 --> 00:50:26,543
Today is the last day
of Carmelita's vacation.

847
00:50:27,851 --> 00:50:29,751
Look<i>, amigo.</i>

848
00:50:29,786 --> 00:50:31,583
Would you like to sell my hat?

849
00:50:31,755 --> 00:50:33,985
How could I? Sell it yourself.

850
00:50:34,191 --> 00:50:36,386
You don't have a nice hat.

851
00:50:37,394 --> 00:50:38,590
Here, buy mine.

852
00:50:38,625 --> 00:50:39,786
Ten <i>pesos.</i>

853
00:50:40,163 --> 00:50:41,598
I don't want your hat.

854
00:50:41,633 --> 00:50:42,929
I want this.

855
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:45,535
You wear a bonnet, I wear a hat.

856
00:50:45,570 --> 00:50:47,070
Don't pester me, mister.

857
00:50:47,105 --> 00:50:48,037
Excuse me?

858
00:50:49,506 --> 00:50:53,306
I don't deserve to have
the mother I do, Mrs. Linda.

859
00:50:54,377 --> 00:50:57,835
She suffered so much
since she became a widow.

860
00:50:58,115 --> 00:51:01,218
To handle a lost soul like me.

861
00:51:01,253 --> 00:51:02,384
Come, come now.

862
00:51:02,419 --> 00:51:04,421
Who is your mother's pride?

863
00:51:04,456 --> 00:51:06,116
No, no, no.

864
00:51:06,289 --> 00:51:09,417
She would say that out of kindness.

865
00:51:10,827 --> 00:51:12,827
She will go straight to Heaven...

866
00:51:12,862 --> 00:51:14,827
...fully dressed to her shoes.

867
00:51:27,744 --> 00:51:30,235
Where are you going in
that state, Silvestre?

868
00:51:30,447 --> 00:51:32,608
I'm a man, mom.

869
00:51:32,716 --> 00:51:34,684
To keep my promise.

870
00:51:35,218 --> 00:51:36,818
I have a debt.

871
00:51:36,853 --> 00:51:38,787
A debt? Who do you owe?

872
00:51:40,223 --> 00:51:41,190
My friend.

873
00:51:42,092 --> 00:51:43,827
I have to take him to Petatlan.

874
00:51:43,862 --> 00:51:45,128
You will stay right here.

875
00:51:45,163 --> 00:51:46,390
Look, Silvestre.

876
00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:48,860
You know my hurry.
Lend me your truck.

877
00:51:49,499 --> 00:51:51,262
If you ask for my life...

878
00:51:51,835 --> 00:51:53,666
...my life I would give to you.

879
00:51:53,904 --> 00:51:54,700
Take it.

880
00:51:55,572 --> 00:51:57,130
It's all yours.

881
00:51:58,875 --> 00:51:59,933
Will you look at that.

882
00:52:06,650 --> 00:52:08,777
Candidate. It's ten o'clock.

883
00:52:09,853 --> 00:52:10,919
Ten?

884
00:52:10,954 --> 00:52:12,922
Damn, the motorcycle isn't here yet.

885
00:52:13,323 --> 00:52:15,202
Who told me to act like a priest...

886
00:52:15,237 --> 00:52:17,082
...snooping in none of my business?

887
00:52:17,727 --> 00:52:20,141
I thought this would
happen, Congressman.

888
00:52:20,176 --> 00:52:22,555
That's what you think.
I've got the victory.

889
00:52:22,666 --> 00:52:25,464
Except the rally won't
be the same without me.

890
00:52:38,448 --> 00:52:39,540
Hey.

891
00:52:39,649 --> 00:52:41,810
Raquel, where are you going?

892
00:52:42,018 --> 00:52:45,078
I'm spending the night
in Petatlan, bye.

893
00:52:49,893 --> 00:52:51,493
You've been warned.

894
00:52:51,528 --> 00:52:53,496
They stole her from you, Congressman.

895
00:53:14,284 --> 00:53:18,050
Ascent to Heaven port

896
00:53:32,502 --> 00:53:33,332
Leave me alone.

897
00:53:34,004 --> 00:53:35,335
Come on.

898
00:53:41,444 --> 00:53:43,129
I've always liked you, Oliverio.

899
00:53:43,164 --> 00:53:44,814
But now you're electrifying me.

900
00:53:44,849 --> 00:53:45,940
Simmer down.

901
00:53:46,483 --> 00:53:48,083
Oh. I like them better gruff.

902
00:53:48,118 --> 00:53:50,487
Stop horsing around,
we're going to lose control.

903
00:53:50,522 --> 00:53:52,522
That's what I want, to lose control.

904
00:53:52,557 --> 00:53:54,274
I'm in no mood for jokes.

905
00:53:54,309 --> 00:53:55,992
Hey, don't get so jumpy.

906
00:54:01,164 --> 00:54:02,893
Can't you see you're not alone?

907
00:54:03,099 --> 00:54:04,088
You're reckless.

908
00:54:04,467 --> 00:54:05,066
Sure.

909
00:54:05,101 --> 00:54:08,264
I'm worth nothing to you,
you don't care if you kill me.

910
00:54:08,905 --> 00:54:10,923
After humiliating me for so long.

911
00:54:10,958 --> 00:54:12,942
What woman would risk so much?

912
00:54:13,476 --> 00:54:14,894
Say something, you sissy.

913
00:54:14,929 --> 00:54:16,405
All because of this rain.

914
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:17,644
Yeah, blame the rain.

915
00:54:17,679 --> 00:54:18,848
Stop playing the fool.

916
00:54:40,470 --> 00:54:41,129
Let go.

917
00:54:41,805 --> 00:54:42,772
What a brute.

918
00:54:50,213 --> 00:54:52,181
It's all your fault, you tramp.

919
00:54:52,282 --> 00:54:54,451
When the baker is no good,
he blames the flour.

920
00:54:54,486 --> 00:54:56,487
Don't give me that nonsense.

921
00:54:56,522 --> 00:54:58,284
You're right to be mad, darling.

922
00:54:58,319 --> 00:55:00,046
Do with me whatever you want.

923
00:55:00,323 --> 00:55:02,559
When we get to the top
I'm going to teach you...

924
00:55:02,594 --> 00:55:03,692
If you were a man...

925
00:55:03,727 --> 00:55:05,456
...you would have done that already.

926
00:55:05,528 --> 00:55:06,495
You'll see soon enough.

927
00:55:25,582 --> 00:55:27,743
We're at the top. Now what?

928
00:55:27,884 --> 00:55:31,321
Weren't you going to teach me,
little jasmine flower?

929
00:55:31,356 --> 00:55:33,653
I'm going to teach you
to respect me.

930
00:55:33,957 --> 00:55:35,492
Shameless tramp.

931
00:55:35,527 --> 00:55:36,694
Come on.

932
00:55:36,729 --> 00:55:37,826
It was fate.

933
00:55:37,861 --> 00:55:40,397
I was so wrong in
throwing myself at you.

934
00:55:40,432 --> 00:55:41,557
Hit me.

935
00:56:17,634 --> 00:56:19,819
Is Mr. Eladio Gonzalez here?

936
00:56:19,854 --> 00:56:21,970
- Who? The candidate?
- Yes.

937
00:56:22,005 --> 00:56:24,808
- I need to see him.
- You'll find him at that house.

938
00:56:24,843 --> 00:56:26,207
Thank you very much.

939
00:56:27,010 --> 00:56:29,240
Your junk won't make it back.

940
00:56:29,312 --> 00:56:32,080
Oliverio is one of the
best drivers around.

941
00:56:32,115 --> 00:56:35,482
Perhaps, but with all the thunder
and dynamite he's carrying...

942
00:56:36,019 --> 00:56:38,817
You'll have to collect
his body with a shovel.

943
00:56:39,022 --> 00:56:41,724
Don't be so gloomy, Mr. Gonzalez.

944
00:56:41,759 --> 00:56:42,759
Why, Mr. Nemesio?

945
00:56:42,794 --> 00:56:43,725
Poor Silvestre.

946
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:46,763
Is it allowed to take
dynamite on buses?

947
00:56:46,798 --> 00:56:48,594
We travel with children, and...

948
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:52,597
It's a manner of speech.

949
00:56:54,437 --> 00:56:55,665
I see.

950
00:57:02,378 --> 00:57:03,538
Hi, Pedro.

951
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:05,870
Just a minute, please.

952
00:57:11,321 --> 00:57:13,321
Who would know that Eladio...

953
00:57:13,356 --> 00:57:15,423
...the son of a simple water carrier...

954
00:57:15,458 --> 00:57:17,858
...would consider being
Father of the Homeland?

955
00:57:18,294 --> 00:57:19,989
Buckets are like...

956
00:57:20,497 --> 00:57:21,122
...like...

957
00:57:21,998 --> 00:57:24,626
Life is like the buckets
of a water-wheel...

958
00:57:24,734 --> 00:57:26,759
...my dear Mr. Nemesio.

959
00:57:27,403 --> 00:57:30,607
My committee wants me to go to
Petatlan instead of Chilpancingo.

960
00:57:30,642 --> 00:57:32,097
I'm a fortunate man, aren't I?

961
00:57:32,809 --> 00:57:34,174
Say good-bye to the family for me.

962
00:57:34,277 --> 00:57:35,471
Good-bye, doll.

963
00:58:05,341 --> 00:58:06,603
- Raquel.
- Yes?

964
00:58:07,076 --> 00:58:08,611
Where are you going? I'll take you.

965
00:58:08,646 --> 00:58:09,839
Wherever you're staying.

966
00:58:09,913 --> 00:58:11,246
I can take you anywhere.

967
00:58:11,281 --> 00:58:14,842
In that case, take me to the
Golden Palm, it's 5 blocks away.

968
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:19,684
A. Figueroa y Lezama
Lawyer

969
00:58:25,695 --> 00:58:26,992
No, son, no.

970
00:58:27,730 --> 00:58:30,631
At my age, I wouldn't
go to San Jeronimito...

971
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:32,224
...for all the gold in the world.

972
00:58:32,302 --> 00:58:34,971
Risk crossing that
<i>Ascent to Heaven</i>?

973
00:58:35,006 --> 00:58:36,029
Don't even think of it.

974
00:58:37,507 --> 00:58:38,804
But, Mr. Counselor...

975
00:58:38,942 --> 00:58:41,274
Don't worry, man, don't fret.

976
00:58:41,411 --> 00:58:45,404
I know how to fix this
without risking my life.

977
00:58:45,682 --> 00:58:47,411
Just leave it to me, you'll see.

978
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:49,719
Mother must dictate her will.

979
00:58:49,754 --> 00:58:51,687
Forget the will.

980
00:58:52,021 --> 00:58:52,851
Listen.

981
00:58:53,456 --> 00:58:57,017
Do you know somebody trustworthy
enough to say that...

982
00:58:57,193 --> 00:59:00,128
...your mother owes
that person money?

983
00:59:00,463 --> 00:59:00,986
Well...

984
00:59:01,164 --> 00:59:03,232
My father-in-law, Mr. Lucilo Peña.

985
00:59:03,267 --> 00:59:04,529
Excellent.

986
00:59:05,201 --> 00:59:07,971
I have a means to solve all this.

987
00:59:08,006 --> 00:59:08,903
See?

988
00:59:09,072 --> 00:59:11,104
I'm going to fill in these papers.

989
00:59:11,139 --> 00:59:13,137
Then, your mother over there...

990
00:59:13,242 --> 00:59:16,302
...needs to put her finger
print on them. Here.

991
00:59:16,446 --> 00:59:17,913
Under each bill of debt.

992
00:59:18,581 --> 00:59:21,345
I'll write them in
your father-in-law's name.

993
00:59:22,085 --> 00:59:23,848
Then, Mr. Lucilo must...

994
00:59:23,987 --> 00:59:25,753
...impound the house in Portales...

995
00:59:25,788 --> 00:59:28,154
...and write it off
in your nephew's name.

996
00:59:28,524 --> 00:59:30,841
These documents are legally valid.

997
00:59:30,876 --> 00:59:33,159
Your siblings can't dispute them.

998
00:59:33,296 --> 00:59:34,058
I hope not.

999
00:59:34,197 --> 00:59:36,062
You don't know how greedy they are.

1000
00:59:36,633 --> 00:59:38,692
Who knows what they're scheming now.

1001
00:59:41,237 --> 00:59:44,968
In complete use of her
mental faculties...

1002
00:59:45,108 --> 00:59:45,767
...declares...

1003
00:59:46,309 --> 00:59:48,311
...to be the owner of a property...

1004
00:59:48,346 --> 00:59:50,097
...called The Large Coconut Grove.

1005
00:59:50,132 --> 00:59:51,774
The boats and the fishing gear.

1006
00:59:51,809 --> 00:59:53,374
We said those are for Oliverio.

1007
00:59:53,409 --> 00:59:54,940
It shall be clearly stated.

1008
00:59:55,518 --> 00:59:56,951
So.

1009
00:59:57,420 --> 01:00:00,356
In the presence of Mr. Juan
and Mr. Felipe Grajales...

1010
01:00:00,391 --> 01:00:01,724
The house in Portales, Mexico City.

1011
01:00:01,759 --> 01:00:02,986
We said it was mine.

1012
01:00:03,126 --> 01:00:04,218
Put it in writing.

1013
01:00:04,394 --> 01:00:05,945
Words are like feathers in the wind.

1014
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:07,497
That's why we're making this document.

1015
01:00:07,532 --> 01:00:08,598
You have to decide.

1016
01:00:08,633 --> 01:00:09,496
Let's do it.

1017
01:00:09,699 --> 01:00:11,666
By right, the house is mine.

1018
01:00:11,701 --> 01:00:15,501
In that case, it's rightfully
mine, I'm the eldest.

1019
01:00:15,805 --> 01:00:17,033
Are you giving in?

1020
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:19,130
Me, give in? Never.

1021
01:00:19,275 --> 01:00:20,333
Then, you have to play.

1022
01:00:20,777 --> 01:00:21,539
One match.

1023
01:00:21,711 --> 01:00:22,410
Play it.

1024
01:00:22,445 --> 01:00:24,413
- Come on.
- Come on.

1025
01:00:26,249 --> 01:00:27,238
You first.

1026
01:00:27,550 --> 01:00:30,212
See? I'm even giving
you a head start.

1027
01:00:30,319 --> 01:00:32,753
Anyway, the house in
Portales is for me.

1028
01:00:32,889 --> 01:00:34,322
Luck will settle it.

1029
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:38,384
Two fives.

1030
01:00:38,661 --> 01:00:40,185
Black is your fate.

1031
01:00:44,767 --> 01:00:45,597
Two sixes.

1032
01:00:46,069 --> 01:00:46,626
See?

1033
01:00:47,336 --> 01:00:48,633
It's God's will.

1034
01:00:48,771 --> 01:00:49,965
What did I tell you?

1035
01:00:50,673 --> 01:00:53,242
The house in Portales will
be inherited by...

1036
01:00:53,277 --> 01:00:55,733
...the individual
Juan Grajales.

1037
01:00:58,848 --> 01:01:01,146
Quiet, your grandmother's asleep.

1038
01:01:16,966 --> 01:01:17,489
Mother.

1039
01:01:17,867 --> 01:01:19,234
How are you, mother?

1040
01:01:19,269 --> 01:01:20,601
Slightly better.

1041
01:01:20,703 --> 01:01:23,729
We made out your will with
the Municipal authority.

1042
01:01:23,806 --> 01:01:24,500
Yes, mother.

1043
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:26,505
To spare you the trouble.

1044
01:01:26,776 --> 01:01:28,505
Why don't you let her rest?

1045
01:01:28,745 --> 01:01:31,179
- Come later.
- Be quiet, you dummy.

1046
01:01:31,314 --> 01:01:32,713
You have no say in this.

1047
01:01:32,849 --> 01:01:33,838
Why not?

1048
01:01:34,050 --> 01:01:36,382
- She's my daughter-in-law.
- Felipe.

1049
01:01:36,919 --> 01:01:38,386
I think she's right.

1050
01:01:38,421 --> 01:01:39,820
If you don't mind, Albina.

1051
01:01:39,989 --> 01:01:42,617
Will you bring the pen
so mother can sign?

1052
01:01:43,192 --> 01:01:45,353
You know I can't write.

1053
01:01:45,461 --> 01:01:47,190
You don't have to write, mother.

1054
01:01:47,663 --> 01:01:48,595
Look, here.

1055
01:01:48,731 --> 01:01:50,366
You just need to make an "x"...

1056
01:01:50,401 --> 01:01:52,302
...under the written part.

1057
01:01:52,337 --> 01:01:54,203
I can't move this hand.

1058
01:01:54,437 --> 01:01:55,199
It's heavy.

1059
01:01:55,738 --> 01:01:56,602
That doesn't matter.

1060
01:01:56,939 --> 01:01:58,998
Let's try with your left.

1061
01:01:59,375 --> 01:02:00,433
I'll guide your hand.

1062
01:02:01,844 --> 01:02:03,072
Why with the left hand...

1063
01:02:03,212 --> 01:02:04,839
...if she just said she's better?

1064
01:02:04,981 --> 01:02:05,879
Give me that.

1065
01:02:06,415 --> 01:02:08,576
You won't refuse, will you?

1066
01:02:08,751 --> 01:02:09,809
Make an "x".

1067
01:02:10,319 --> 01:02:12,753
I won't do anything
until Oliverio returns.

1068
01:02:13,923 --> 01:02:15,356
Where is he?

1069
01:02:15,858 --> 01:02:17,348
Yeah, where is he?

1070
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:26,159
Golden Palm
guesthouse

1071
01:02:29,472 --> 01:02:30,666
Good-bye, Raquel.

1072
01:02:31,974 --> 01:02:34,377
- Are you going back?
- Yes, do you need anything?

1073
01:02:34,412 --> 01:02:35,443
Not me.

1074
01:02:35,478 --> 01:02:37,036
In case you wanted something.

1075
01:02:37,747 --> 01:02:39,612
I got what I wanted.

1076
01:02:40,550 --> 01:02:42,177
Well then, good-bye.

1077
01:02:42,618 --> 01:02:45,086
Good-bye, and good luck, baby.

1078
01:02:54,163 --> 01:02:56,499
Here so soon, Congressman?

1079
01:02:56,534 --> 01:02:58,266
What a surprise.

1080
01:02:58,301 --> 01:03:00,064
Keep your distance, girl.

1081
01:03:00,269 --> 01:03:01,531
Try your tricks on someone else.

1082
01:03:01,604 --> 01:03:03,663
Heavens, you can't take a joke.

1083
01:03:03,773 --> 01:03:04,467
Of course.

1084
01:03:04,540 --> 01:03:07,343
I was convincing in my
taste for young boys.

1085
01:03:07,378 --> 01:03:09,174
I said, behave yourself.

1086
01:03:09,378 --> 01:03:11,458
Stay around, we'll talk later.

1087
01:03:11,493 --> 01:03:13,538
Don't try so hard to be a man.

1088
01:03:13,649 --> 01:03:15,913
So handsome and such a good catch.

1089
01:03:19,755 --> 01:03:21,086
Here come my people.

1090
01:03:21,757 --> 01:03:23,622
Go away, this is a serious matter.

1091
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:27,288
They've come for the shepherd
who will keep them united.

1092
01:03:33,669 --> 01:03:35,068
Leave me alone.

1093
01:03:36,138 --> 01:03:37,138
Friends.

1094
01:03:37,173 --> 01:03:39,107
Here is the cowardly Eladio.

1095
01:03:39,942 --> 01:03:41,744
Hurrah for the people's candidate!

1096
01:03:41,779 --> 01:03:43,678
- Hurrah!
- Hurrah!

1097
01:03:43,846 --> 01:03:46,713
<i>He's here to steal from us.</i>
<i>Get rid of him...</i>

1098
01:03:49,819 --> 01:03:51,118
Death to him

1099
01:03:51,153 --> 01:03:53,178
- Death.
- Death.

1100
01:03:55,224 --> 01:03:57,191
Death to him.

1101
01:03:57,226 --> 01:04:00,093
- Death.
- Death.

1102
01:04:00,663 --> 01:04:01,254
Calm down.

1103
01:04:01,898 --> 01:04:03,729
This nation is free and democratic.

1104
01:04:04,267 --> 01:04:05,632
We fight for principles...

1105
01:04:05,701 --> 01:04:06,633
...not for men.

1106
01:04:07,169 --> 01:04:10,036
Every Mexican has a right
to vote and be voted.

1107
01:04:10,973 --> 01:04:12,804
Suffrage is free.

1108
01:04:14,710 --> 01:04:16,075
Mr. Eladio Gonzalez...

1109
01:04:16,345 --> 01:04:19,075
...a political adversary
is not a personal enemy.

1110
01:04:19,348 --> 01:04:20,337
Let me shake that hand.

1111
01:04:21,684 --> 01:04:22,343
With pleasure.

1112
01:04:22,652 --> 01:04:25,086
I am deeply pleased to
have you as an adversary.

1113
01:04:25,288 --> 01:04:27,813
There are still
some moral men left.

1114
01:04:27,990 --> 01:04:29,014
That's what I say.

1115
01:04:29,292 --> 01:04:30,589
Your words honor me.

1116
01:04:31,027 --> 01:04:31,823
Ballot boxes...

1117
01:04:32,061 --> 01:04:33,153
...not insults...

1118
01:04:33,329 --> 01:04:34,353
...will give us the victory.

1119
01:04:34,497 --> 01:04:35,725
That's what I expect, my friend.

1120
01:04:37,333 --> 01:04:38,095
Good-bye, my friend.

1121
01:04:40,403 --> 01:04:41,602
Let the march continue.

1122
01:04:41,637 --> 01:04:43,730
Actions Not Words
Sanchez Coello

1123
01:04:59,221 --> 01:05:00,483
Hurrah for the People's Candidate

1124
01:05:05,328 --> 01:05:06,761
My poor Congressman.

1125
01:05:06,796 --> 01:05:08,991
Look at what they did.
Come, I'll wash you.

1126
01:05:09,131 --> 01:05:12,328
Go back to your chores.
This is not a matter for women.

1127
01:05:12,735 --> 01:05:14,100
Please go away.

1128
01:05:14,470 --> 01:05:17,496
Forget the past.
Come so I can wash you.

1129
01:05:18,307 --> 01:05:19,865
Leave me alone, madam.

1130
01:06:00,683 --> 01:06:02,651
<i>Compadre</i> Chema,
what's the matter?

1131
01:06:02,686 --> 01:06:04,243
Just life<i>, compadre.</i>

1132
01:06:04,687 --> 01:06:06,348
Eusebita, your goddaughter.

1133
01:06:06,956 --> 01:06:08,048
She's left us.

1134
01:06:08,657 --> 01:06:10,124
No, what do you mean?

1135
01:06:10,459 --> 01:06:12,560
We just saw her yesterday.

1136
01:06:12,595 --> 01:06:14,688
It was very quick<i>, compadre.</i>

1137
01:06:15,431 --> 01:06:16,693
A snake bit her, and...

1138
01:06:16,899 --> 01:06:17,593
You know.

1139
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:18,762
Mr. Chema.

1140
01:06:19,101 --> 01:06:20,762
- I share your pain.
- Thank you.

1141
01:06:21,404 --> 01:06:22,029
Chema...

1142
01:06:22,571 --> 01:06:24,232
I can't find the words, you know...

1143
01:06:24,740 --> 01:06:25,707
My goddaughter.

1144
01:06:27,443 --> 01:06:28,603
Be strong<i>, compadre.</i>

1145
01:06:29,645 --> 01:06:31,112
I share your pain.

1146
01:06:31,313 --> 01:06:31,972
Thank you.

1147
01:06:32,882 --> 01:06:34,008
Let's go.

1148
01:06:43,592 --> 01:06:46,288
- I feel your loss.
- Thank you, Mr. Nemesio.

1149
01:07:34,343 --> 01:07:35,310
Who would have known?

1150
01:07:35,978 --> 01:07:37,445
Some go and others arrive.

1151
01:07:37,980 --> 01:07:40,448
The day before yesterday
a little angel was born.

1152
01:07:40,850 --> 01:07:42,841
Today another one took flight.

1153
01:07:42,952 --> 01:07:43,543
Poor thing.

1154
01:07:43,886 --> 01:07:45,148
Poor us...

1155
01:07:45,321 --> 01:07:48,779
...who have endure such
disorderly times.

1156
01:07:50,159 --> 01:07:52,093
May I see her face, Mr. Chema?

1157
01:07:52,261 --> 01:07:52,852
Yes, dear.

1158
01:07:53,896 --> 01:07:54,590
Look at her.

1159
01:07:56,232 --> 01:07:57,893
Wasn't my little girl pretty?

1160
01:07:58,067 --> 01:07:58,999
Yes, Mr. Chema.

1161
01:07:59,201 --> 01:08:00,998
She looks like she's asleep.

1162
01:08:01,971 --> 01:08:04,804
Too bad the earth
has to eat her.

1163
01:08:36,138 --> 01:08:36,866
Silvestre...

1164
01:08:37,439 --> 01:08:38,633
...I feel so bad for Mr. Chema.

1165
01:08:38,908 --> 01:08:40,407
But you know I have to go.

1166
01:08:40,442 --> 01:08:42,137
Since you have to be with him...

1167
01:08:42,211 --> 01:08:42,776
...I'll walk.

1168
01:08:42,811 --> 01:08:44,301
Man, there's always a solution.

1169
01:08:44,547 --> 01:08:46,447
I'll stay for the burial.

1170
01:08:46,882 --> 01:08:49,112
You take the car. That easy.

1171
01:08:49,318 --> 01:08:50,615
Thank you, Silvestre.

1172
01:09:25,154 --> 01:09:26,889
Look after your luggage.

1173
01:09:26,924 --> 01:09:28,254
I'll be right back.

1174
01:09:28,891 --> 01:09:30,153
I can't believe this guy.

1175
01:09:30,359 --> 01:09:32,657
He runs and leaves us here.

1176
01:09:32,795 --> 01:09:35,263
Who will be responsible
if something is missing?

1177
01:09:35,397 --> 01:09:37,490
I'll unload the top.

1178
01:09:50,012 --> 01:09:50,944
Albina.

1179
01:09:54,383 --> 01:09:55,714
- Your mother.
- No.

1180
01:09:56,518 --> 01:09:57,917
You barely missed her.

1181
01:10:40,162 --> 01:10:42,187
<i>I got what I wanted.</i>

1182
01:10:53,942 --> 01:10:54,931
Where are my brothers?

1183
01:10:55,577 --> 01:10:56,942
They left this morning.

1184
01:10:57,413 --> 01:10:58,778
Where is Chucho?

1185
01:10:58,881 --> 01:11:00,280
I left him asleep at the patch.

1186
01:11:00,549 --> 01:11:01,345
Go to the door...

1187
01:11:01,583 --> 01:11:02,572
...and tell me if anyone comes.

1188
01:11:40,622 --> 01:11:41,748
Here come your brothers.

1189
01:12:16,892 --> 01:12:19,952
<i>Thy will be done on Earth</i>
<i>as it is in Heaven...</i>

1190
01:12:26,235 --> 01:12:27,133
Come with me.

1191
01:12:27,536 --> 01:12:28,332
This is the moment.

1192
01:12:33,776 --> 01:12:36,836
<i>Blessed Mary, mother of God,</i>
<i>pray for us...</i>

1193
01:12:39,281 --> 01:12:41,044
We couldn't tell you before...

1194
01:12:41,283 --> 01:12:43,046
Mother dictated her final will...

1195
01:12:43,419 --> 01:12:44,784
...which is on this paper.

1196
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:45,784
Yes, Oliverio.

1197
01:12:45,921 --> 01:12:48,253
It's all there, poor mother.

1198
01:12:48,457 --> 01:12:51,620
Her final moments were harder
because you weren't here.

1199
01:12:51,827 --> 01:12:53,429
This isn't valid. It isn't signed.

1200
01:12:53,464 --> 01:12:54,910
What proof do you want?

1201
01:12:54,945 --> 01:12:56,357
Isn't our word enough?

1202
01:12:56,465 --> 01:12:57,830
We'll talk some other day.

1203
01:12:58,033 --> 01:12:59,125
When we're calmer.

1204
01:12:59,334 --> 01:13:00,969
This isn't the right time.

1205
01:13:01,004 --> 01:13:02,368
Oliverio is right.

1206
01:13:02,504 --> 01:13:04,028
Let's not rush.

1207
01:13:04,173 --> 01:13:05,162
Besides...

1208
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:07,765
...we have to respect
the loss we are grieving.

1209
01:13:08,177 --> 01:13:09,041
Albina...

1210
01:13:09,678 --> 01:13:10,076
...come.

1211
01:13:13,882 --> 01:13:16,817
<i>Hail Mary!</i>
<i>Full of grace...</i>

1212
01:13:22,825 --> 01:13:23,621
Did you hear?

1213
01:13:24,059 --> 01:13:25,686
You won't get your way.

1214
01:13:26,395 --> 01:13:27,692
Bottomless ditch...

1215
01:13:27,963 --> 01:13:29,123
...scoundrels.

1216
01:13:31,633 --> 01:13:32,759
Save the bills of credit.

1217
01:13:34,770 --> 01:13:36,362
My mother's will shall prevail...

1218
01:13:36,672 --> 01:13:38,640
The house in Portales
will be Chucho's.

1219
01:13:38,941 --> 01:13:39,908
He'll go to school...

1220
01:13:40,008 --> 01:13:41,737
...and have everything he needs.

1221
01:14:06,502 --> 01:14:15,501
THE END

1222
01:14:16,305 --> 01:15:16,674
