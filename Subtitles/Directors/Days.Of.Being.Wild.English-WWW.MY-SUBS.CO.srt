1
00:01:33,511 --> 00:01:34,679
How much?

2
00:01:35,346 --> 00:01:37,807
Twenty cents, plus five for deposit.

3
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:44,939
What's your name?

4
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:56,075
Why should I tell you?

5
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,921
I already know.

6
00:02:13,134 --> 00:02:15,553
Your name is...

7
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,139
Su Li-zhen.

8
00:02:20,558 --> 00:02:21,976
Who told you?

9
00:02:34,113 --> 00:02:35,990
You'll see me tonight in your dreams.

10
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:16,465
I didn't see you in my dreams last night.

11
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:22,930
Of course not.
You didn't even get any sleep.

12
00:04:25,808 --> 00:04:29,061
Don't fight it. You'll see me for sure.

13
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:09,560
There's something different
about you today.

14
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:11,770
No, there's nothing different.

15
00:05:11,854 --> 00:05:13,063
No?

16
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:15,566
Why are your ears red?

17
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,321
What do you want?

18
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:22,781
I just want to be friends with you.

19
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:24,366
Why should I be your friend?

20
00:05:31,624 --> 00:05:33,042
Look at my watch.

21
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:34,627
Why should I?

22
00:05:35,461 --> 00:05:36,879
Just for a minute, okay?

23
00:05:55,064 --> 00:05:56,732
Time's up. What now?

24
00:05:57,316 --> 00:05:58,734
What's today's date?

25
00:06:00,236 --> 00:06:01,445
The 16th.

26
00:06:02,655 --> 00:06:03,906
The 16th.

27
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:05,658
April 16th.

28
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:10,913
April 16th, 1960, one minute before 3:00.

29
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:12,456
We were here together.

30
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:16,168
I'll always remember
that minute because of you.

31
00:06:17,086 --> 00:06:19,505
From now on, we're one-minute friends.

32
00:06:21,674 --> 00:06:24,468
It's a fact. You can't deny it.

33
00:06:24,552 --> 00:06:26,136
It's already happened.

34
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:31,892
I'll be back tomorrow.

35
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:42,945
<i>Would he remember
that minute because of me?</i>

36
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:44,405
<i>I don't know.</i>

37
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:47,241
<i>But I remembered him.</i>

38
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:50,786
<i>He came back every day after that.</i>

39
00:06:51,412 --> 00:06:53,330
<i>We started as one-minute friends,</i>

40
00:06:53,414 --> 00:06:55,165
<i>then two minutes...</i>

41
00:06:56,292 --> 00:06:59,878
<i>Soon we were spending
an hour a day together.</i>

42
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,482
How long have we known each other?

43
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:22,776
A long time.

44
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:24,612
I've forgotten.

45
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:35,914
My cousin's getting married soon.

46
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:38,626
Really? Give her my best wishes.

47
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:44,256
She said

48
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,009
she'll be moving in
with her husband's family.

49
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,345
So?

50
00:07:52,056 --> 00:07:54,016
I have to find some place else to live.

51
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:10,866
I'd like to live with you.

52
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:20,793
Sure.

53
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:28,967
How will I tell my dad?

54
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:31,637
Tell him what?

55
00:08:32,388 --> 00:08:34,014
About us.

56
00:08:34,098 --> 00:08:35,391
What about us?

57
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:14,805
Would you marry me?

58
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:27,818
No.

59
00:09:57,973 --> 00:09:59,683
I'm never coming back.

60
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:41,975
Come in, quick.

61
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:44,686
Your mother drank too much
and threw up all over.

62
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:47,272
I'm so worried about her.

63
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,882
Bring her some tea.

64
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:09,938
Are you hungry?
You want something to eat?

65
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:12,566
Who's that guy?

66
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:15,402
It was just a pair of earrings!

67
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:17,529
Here, take 'em back!

68
00:12:26,163 --> 00:12:27,539
You stole more than that.

69
00:12:27,623 --> 00:12:30,792
I told you I never stole anything!
She gave them to me willingly!

70
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:37,257
You mean she's willing
to let you freeload off her!

71
00:12:41,136 --> 00:12:44,139
- Let's see what you say now.
- Don't hit me!

72
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:49,895
- Huh?
- Stop hitting me!

73
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:53,231
What's that? Speak up!

74
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:55,817
- Louder!
- I stole 'em!

75
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:57,194
Louder!

76
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:58,236
I stole 'em!

77
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:03,951
I'm warning you: Don't let me
catch you around my mother again!

78
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:22,010
You can get changed now.

79
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:05,220
I left some earrings here.
Have you seen them?

80
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:09,182
No, but I'll help you look.

81
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:15,272
Hey, what are you doing?

82
00:14:29,453 --> 00:14:31,121
You like this earring?

83
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:32,956
Keep it.

84
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:44,509
Hey!

85
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:50,057
Why just one?

86
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:51,975
I'll wait for you downstairs.

87
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:05,072
Where are we?

88
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:06,782
My place.

89
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:09,534
When did I say I'd come home with you?

90
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:11,620
You never said you wouldn't.

91
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,221
You live alone?

92
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:35,685
Is the rent high?

93
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:37,020
Forty bucks.

94
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:38,105
Wow.

95
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:42,484
My whole family lives in one room
that only costs 28.

96
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,533
You bring girls home often?

97
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:54,329
Sometimes.

98
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:03,505
Let's get something clear.
I'll stay, but just for a little while.

99
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:12,055
It's stuffy in here.

100
00:16:14,558 --> 00:16:16,977
Are there other tenants here?

101
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:27,279
Why's this room empty?

102
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:30,740
You like nosing around
other people's places.

103
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,620
Where's the bathroom?

104
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,006
Let's go get something to eat.

105
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:48,258
Why didn't you say so earlier?

106
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:55,223
It's pouring outside.

107
00:16:55,307 --> 00:16:56,641
I'd better go now.

108
00:16:56,725 --> 00:16:58,310
Would you take me home?

109
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:07,986
- Why did you come with me then?
- I just promised to stay a while.

110
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,946
What kind of girl do you think I am?

111
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:13,200
Don't think I just jump
into bed with guys!

112
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:16,536
Don't think I'll do just anything
for some cheap earrings!

113
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:19,372
I'm not like those other loose women!

114
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:21,249
Don't come near me!

115
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,911
Let's see how long
you can go without breathing.

116
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:35,490
- A thief!
- Who's that?

117
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:37,534
- It's me.
- My friend.

118
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:45,417
I've told you many times
not to climb up here.

119
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:50,338
I don't want that Indian guard
downstairs to hassle me.

120
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,596
I didn't know you had a friend here.
I'll be going.

121
00:18:59,514 --> 00:19:01,599
Take the stairs.

122
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:04,436
In the window, out the window.

123
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:08,565
How come your friend's so strange?
What's he do?

124
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:10,942
Don't ask so many questions.

125
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:25,623
Is he a thief?

126
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:41,973
What time is it?

127
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:48,772
About 3:00.

128
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,152
I've gotta go home now.

129
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,469
Will we see each other tomorrow?

130
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,054
Maybe.

131
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:24,849
Then call me.

132
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,770
You have my phone number?

133
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:35,693
I'll write it down.

134
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:53,962
Call after 11:00 or I won't be there.

135
00:20:56,506 --> 00:20:57,549
Here.

136
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:03,805
Leung Fung-ying? Aren't you called Lulu?

137
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:07,308
My coworkers don't know my English name.

138
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:10,895
Call me. You promised, okay?

139
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:12,856
Okay.

140
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:28,663
I know you won't call.

141
00:21:29,414 --> 00:21:30,957
I will.

142
00:21:34,544 --> 00:21:36,588
You didn't even memorize my number!

143
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:39,424
You wrote it down. Why memorize it?

144
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:40,925
What if it gets lost?

145
00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:47,056
I could get lost just as easily.

146
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,975
Don't you dare lose it!

147
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:51,853
Do it and I'll pour acid on your face!

148
00:21:55,732 --> 00:21:57,650
Don't ever talk to me like that again.

149
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:18,463
You're good.

150
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,174
You tamed me. I have to do as you say.

151
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:25,637
Aren't you going home?

152
00:22:26,387 --> 00:22:27,847
I'll call you a cab.

153
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:41,236
I don't want to go home anymore.

154
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:49,702
Stay here then.

155
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:54,791
Damn you!

156
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:27,782
Good morning.

157
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:33,288
You still here? Don't you have to go home?

158
00:23:33,371 --> 00:23:35,582
You didn't go home yourself.

159
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:38,835
I'm not talking to you.

160
00:23:39,836 --> 00:23:40,878
Hey.

161
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:43,381
Have we ever met?

162
00:23:43,965 --> 00:23:45,883
You don't look familiar.

163
00:23:46,551 --> 00:23:50,388
But you'd be the one to know
if you've noticed me somewhere.

164
00:23:52,724 --> 00:23:55,727
- What do you do for work?
- Work?

165
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:59,564
Turn up the radio.

166
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:22,587
Any idea? Figured it out?

167
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:24,714
Not yet.

168
00:24:25,173 --> 00:24:26,674
Dance for me again, okay?

169
00:24:26,758 --> 00:24:28,718
Trying to take advantage of me?

170
00:24:30,178 --> 00:24:33,222
Hey! What's your name?

171
00:24:33,306 --> 00:24:34,932
Call me Mimi.

172
00:25:07,215 --> 00:25:09,884
<i>I've heard
there's a kind of bird with no legs.</i>

173
00:25:11,094 --> 00:25:13,513
<i>All it can do is fly and fly.</i>

174
00:25:13,596 --> 00:25:15,932
<i>When it gets tired, it sleeps on the wind.</i>

175
00:25:17,892 --> 00:25:20,228
<i>This bird can only land once
in its whole life.</i>

176
00:25:21,813 --> 00:25:23,439
<i>That's the moment it dies.</i>

177
00:26:06,107 --> 00:26:07,275
Auntie.

178
00:26:07,775 --> 00:26:09,777
Come here. I want to talk to you.

179
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:20,913
Move over.

180
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:26,252
Hey, who is she?

181
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:27,795
What was all that about?

182
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:29,589
What?

183
00:26:29,672 --> 00:26:33,468
You know what I'm talking about.
Why did you beat him up?

184
00:26:33,968 --> 00:26:35,887
He was ripping you off.

185
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:38,055
Who told you that?

186
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,975
No one has to tell me.

187
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:43,603
Why else would he be with you?

188
00:26:43,686 --> 00:26:47,190
How old is he? And how old are you?

189
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:48,566
You're not young anymore.

190
00:26:50,568 --> 00:26:53,070
You're right. He's in it for the money.

191
00:26:53,154 --> 00:26:54,697
But he makes me happy.

192
00:26:54,781 --> 00:26:58,701
I raised you and spent lots on you,
but have you ever made me happy?

193
00:26:58,785 --> 00:27:02,330
You think I've been happy?
So we'll be unhappy together.

194
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:05,458
- What do you want?
- You know very well.

195
00:27:10,505 --> 00:27:14,175
How many times
do I have to say I won't tell you?

196
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:16,761
You want to find your real mother, right?

197
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:18,721
Find her yourself, if you can.

198
00:27:19,222 --> 00:27:21,224
I've taken care of you for so many years.

199
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:24,393
If I was gonna tell you,
I'd have done it long ago.

200
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:28,898
I didn't because I couldn't bear
to see you leave.

201
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:32,652
And I won't tell you now either.
What's in it for me?

202
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:34,737
Suppose I tell you.

203
00:27:34,821 --> 00:27:37,490
What do I get if you go off and find her?

204
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:38,783
Nothing!

205
00:27:39,951 --> 00:27:41,536
You'll forget all about me.

206
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,540
What?

207
00:27:45,623 --> 00:27:47,458
Why are you staring at me like that?

208
00:27:49,043 --> 00:27:52,672
Fine. I want you to hate me.

209
00:27:52,755 --> 00:27:54,757
At least that way you won't forget me.

210
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:03,140
Come on, be nicer to me.

211
00:28:03,808 --> 00:28:07,144
Maybe I'll tell you someday.

212
00:28:07,937 --> 00:28:09,480
Otherwise, forget about it.

213
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:12,108
All right.

214
00:28:13,568 --> 00:28:15,987
I'll be waiting for that day.

215
00:28:18,865 --> 00:28:20,867
Is his mother rich?

216
00:28:23,411 --> 00:28:24,787
I think so.

217
00:28:25,955 --> 00:28:27,790
She was a high-class escort.

218
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:30,793
Have you known Yuddy for long?

219
00:28:35,298 --> 00:28:39,635
He used to live
in the apartment above our garage.

220
00:28:42,597 --> 00:28:45,474
You know what's on his mind?

221
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:47,685
No, I don't.

222
00:28:48,978 --> 00:28:52,815
But I know what's on your mind.

223
00:28:53,357 --> 00:28:54,692
What?

224
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,988
Don't fall in love with me!

225
00:29:15,588 --> 00:29:17,214
What are you doing here this late?

226
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:19,675
Waiting for my friend.

227
00:29:26,307 --> 00:29:29,936
- What is it?
- A girl downstairs says she knows you.

228
00:29:30,019 --> 00:29:31,479
You'd better go have a look.

229
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,192
I'm gonna go see.

230
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:50,748
Why are you here?

231
00:29:57,254 --> 00:29:58,798
To get my things.

232
00:30:00,007 --> 00:30:01,175
Come up then.

233
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:35,001
I'd like to come back to you.

234
00:30:35,084 --> 00:30:36,293
What for?

235
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,754
I'm no good for you.

236
00:30:43,926 --> 00:30:45,761
I'm not the marrying type.

237
00:31:06,449 --> 00:31:08,159
I don't care.

238
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:11,454
I just want to stay with you.

239
00:31:21,255 --> 00:31:23,257
Why do you put up with so much from me?

240
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:26,886
You can't just put up with me
for the rest of your life.

241
00:31:33,142 --> 00:31:35,144
You won't be happy with me.

242
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:47,615
Did you ever really love me?

243
00:31:53,454 --> 00:31:56,248
I can't know how many more women
I'll fall for in my life.

244
00:31:57,792 --> 00:32:00,503
I won't know which I love most
till the end of my life.

245
00:32:13,182 --> 00:32:14,433
Wait here.

246
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:16,852
I'll get your things for you.

247
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:20,940
Is someone up there?

248
00:33:05,276 --> 00:33:06,735
Who's outside?

249
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:08,320
Stop asking questions.

250
00:33:38,017 --> 00:33:40,644
- Take off those slippers.
- Why?

251
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:42,855
They belong to someone else.

252
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:46,859
Who says they're hers? You got any proof?

253
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:49,945
You gonna take them off?

254
00:33:50,029 --> 00:33:51,197
No!

255
00:33:51,739 --> 00:33:54,950
A woman shows up out of the blue
claiming this is hers and that's hers.

256
00:33:55,034 --> 00:33:57,453
How many more women will show up later?

257
00:33:57,536 --> 00:34:00,789
If one comes and claims you,
should I just give you up?

258
00:34:00,873 --> 00:34:02,499
I'm not giving up anything!

259
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:04,919
Once I step in here, everything is mine!

260
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:16,222
Why did you come up?
I told you to wait downstairs.

261
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:19,266
I'm leaving.

262
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:33,364
You can sleep with the slippers tonight.

263
00:34:34,782 --> 00:34:37,952
You really care about the slippers?
Okay, I'll give 'em back!

264
00:34:41,455 --> 00:34:43,082
Satisfied now?

265
00:34:43,165 --> 00:34:45,209
After all, nothing here is mine.

266
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:47,711
What am I to you anyway? I'm leaving.

267
00:35:03,727 --> 00:35:06,146
Don't come back
once you step out that door.

268
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:21,078
Do you treat all women like this?

269
00:35:44,143 --> 00:35:46,103
I'm not gonna be as stupid as her.

270
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:06,957
What are you doing?

271
00:36:07,583 --> 00:36:09,835
Why do you treat me like this?

272
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:13,005
Stop! You're hurting me!

273
00:36:43,035 --> 00:36:44,203
You again?

274
00:36:44,995 --> 00:36:46,413
Still haven't gone home?

275
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:53,754
A good night's sleep
and you'll forget your problems.

276
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:35,003
Could you lend me a few dollars for a cab?

277
00:37:55,274 --> 00:37:57,776
I've only got five. Is that enough?

278
00:37:59,862 --> 00:38:01,280
How will I pay you back?

279
00:38:02,531 --> 00:38:03,866
Don't worry about it.

280
00:38:05,367 --> 00:38:07,786
I'm always on duty around here.

281
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:09,621
We may meet again.

282
00:38:09,705 --> 00:38:11,123
Take it.

283
00:38:45,782 --> 00:38:46,992
Oh, it's you.

284
00:38:47,993 --> 00:38:49,786
I wanted to pay you back.

285
00:38:51,121 --> 00:38:54,541
No hurry. It doesn't matter.

286
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:56,418
I don't want to owe you.

287
00:38:57,878 --> 00:38:58,921
Thanks.

288
00:39:00,339 --> 00:39:01,548
Are you all right?

289
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,677
I'll be going now. I have to go to work.

290
00:39:05,761 --> 00:39:08,639
This late? What kind of work?

291
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:11,683
At the stadium.

292
00:39:11,767 --> 00:39:14,478
There's a game tonight.
I have to work the box office.

293
00:39:17,397 --> 00:39:20,943
Then I can get in
to a soccer game for free.

294
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:25,113
I used to like watching soccer,
but I'm too busy these days.

295
00:39:28,325 --> 00:39:31,036
If there's a game you want to see,
don't buy a ticket.

296
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:32,788
I'll get you in.

297
00:39:34,456 --> 00:39:35,749
Thanks.

298
00:40:30,971 --> 00:40:32,973
Could we talk?

299
00:40:34,641 --> 00:40:37,561
I can't help you with your boyfriend.

300
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,606
I just want to talk.

301
00:40:40,689 --> 00:40:42,190
Don't you have any friends?

302
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:46,695
- I don't want others to know.
- But you'll tell me?

303
00:40:50,115 --> 00:40:51,867
If I don't...

304
00:40:57,706 --> 00:41:00,334
If I don't get it off my chest,
I'll go crazy.

305
00:41:07,132 --> 00:41:09,051
I thought I would be okay.

306
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:15,599
I kept telling myself,

307
00:41:16,892 --> 00:41:18,935
"Don't tell others you're unhappy.

308
00:41:20,354 --> 00:41:21,897
Work harder.

309
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:25,192
Go home and get to bed early."

310
00:41:32,532 --> 00:41:34,034
I want to go home,

311
00:41:35,619 --> 00:41:37,204
but my home is in Macao.

312
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:45,629
I don't know how to get through
these long nights.

313
00:41:47,923 --> 00:41:49,383
I can't sleep.

314
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,768
I don't mean to keep coming back.

315
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:04,690
I promise myself, "I won't go back.

316
00:42:07,567 --> 00:42:09,861
I'll hate myself if I go back again."

317
00:42:11,655 --> 00:42:13,365
I don't want to hate myself.

318
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:18,829
Help me, please.

319
00:43:08,295 --> 00:43:09,713
You can't go on like this.

320
00:43:11,631 --> 00:43:13,884
I'll be okay if I can just get
through tonight.

321
00:43:24,561 --> 00:43:26,688
You always say,
"I'll be okay after tonight."

322
00:43:27,522 --> 00:43:28,815
What about last night?

323
00:43:31,193 --> 00:43:33,820
If you'd made it through last night,
you wouldn't be here now.

324
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:40,368
Make up your mind.
Stop going back and forth.

325
00:43:42,287 --> 00:43:44,206
If you really can't live without him,

326
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:48,001
why don't you go right up and tell him?

327
00:43:49,628 --> 00:43:52,964
Otherwise, starting this very minute,
pretend you don't know the guy.

328
00:43:53,048 --> 00:43:54,549
Don't mention "this very minute!"

329
00:44:04,226 --> 00:44:06,686
I used to think a minute
could pass so quickly.

330
00:44:08,855 --> 00:44:10,607
But actually, it can take forever.

331
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:21,159
One day a guy pointed
at his watch and told me

332
00:44:23,203 --> 00:44:25,747
he'd remember me forever
because of that minute.

333
00:44:28,542 --> 00:44:30,293
That sounded so sweet.

334
00:44:43,515 --> 00:44:45,308
But now when I look at that clock,

335
00:44:46,518 --> 00:44:48,186
I tell myself...

336
00:44:50,355 --> 00:44:53,692
I have to forget that guy
starting this very minute.

337
00:45:06,872 --> 00:45:10,083
As a little girl in Macao,
I really wanted to ride the streetcar.

338
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:17,132
Whenever my cousin returned
from Hong Kong,

339
00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:19,593
I'd ask her when she was going
to take me there.

340
00:45:23,179 --> 00:45:24,890
Your cousin is from Hong Kong?

341
00:45:24,973 --> 00:45:28,810
No, but she studied in Hong Kong
when she was young.

342
00:45:30,937 --> 00:45:32,314
She's really sharp.

343
00:45:33,356 --> 00:45:36,568
She got a good job with a foreign company
right after graduation.

344
00:45:39,362 --> 00:45:40,947
Her boyfriend is successful too.

345
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:44,075
She's going to get married soon.

346
00:45:48,371 --> 00:45:50,540
Not everyone can be that lucky.

347
00:45:53,043 --> 00:45:56,129
Don't compare yourself with other people.

348
00:46:00,216 --> 00:46:02,093
I didn't feel poor...

349
00:46:03,887 --> 00:46:05,513
until I started school.

350
00:46:06,723 --> 00:46:09,601
All the other guys got
new uniforms every year,

351
00:46:11,603 --> 00:46:13,772
but I had to wear the same one every year.

352
00:46:16,608 --> 00:46:18,109
That's when...

353
00:46:19,778 --> 00:46:21,321
I realized I was poor.

354
00:46:28,912 --> 00:46:30,789
What made you become a policeman?

355
00:46:36,711 --> 00:46:38,505
I wanted to be a sailor,

356
00:46:40,507 --> 00:46:42,717
but my mother's health wasn't very good,

357
00:46:43,385 --> 00:46:45,345
and there was no one else at home.

358
00:46:45,428 --> 00:46:46,763
So I had to stay.

359
00:46:56,147 --> 00:46:58,942
Don't you find it boring
walking around by yourself all night?

360
00:47:03,738 --> 00:47:05,323
Not really.

361
00:47:25,343 --> 00:47:27,762
I'm tired. I think I'll go home now.

362
00:47:27,846 --> 00:47:28,847
Okay.

363
00:47:30,265 --> 00:47:33,852
If you can't find anyone to talk to,
come see me.

364
00:47:35,395 --> 00:47:38,064
I wouldn't want to interfere
with your work.

365
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:42,777
You can call me then.

366
00:47:44,571 --> 00:47:47,115
I'm here about this time every day.

367
00:47:52,495 --> 00:47:54,456
You have enough money for the fare?

368
00:47:54,539 --> 00:47:56,833
Yes. Bye.

369
00:48:08,511 --> 00:48:12,140
<i>I never really thought she'd call.</i>

370
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:16,603
<i>But every time I passed
by the phone booth,</i>

371
00:48:16,686 --> 00:48:18,563
<i>I'd stand there for a while.</i>

372
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:24,611
<i>Maybe she's all right
and she made it back to Macao.</i>

373
00:48:25,695 --> 00:48:30,825
<i>Or maybe she just needed someone
to help her through that one night.</i>

374
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,663
<i>Soon after that, my mother passed away,</i>

375
00:48:37,207 --> 00:48:39,042
<i>and I became a sailor.</i>

376
00:48:50,553 --> 00:48:53,223
Son, come eat your meal.

377
00:48:53,306 --> 00:48:54,849
It's ready now.

378
00:48:54,933 --> 00:48:57,143
Ranjet, come and eat.

379
00:48:57,227 --> 00:49:00,855
You want me to beat you?

380
00:49:04,692 --> 00:49:07,654
<i>My heart is broken</i>

381
00:49:07,737 --> 00:49:09,364
Do I look pretty?

382
00:49:20,416 --> 00:49:24,671
- Did you scrub the floor?
- Yes. It just dried really fast.

383
00:49:24,754 --> 00:49:26,631
If you don't believe me, I'll swear to it!

384
00:49:26,714 --> 00:49:28,216
Swear on your mother's grave.

385
00:49:29,509 --> 00:49:32,095
Why? So what if I didn't scrub it?

386
00:49:32,178 --> 00:49:33,888
Why should I swear on her grave?

387
00:49:34,973 --> 00:49:36,683
I'll scrub it when I come back, okay?

388
00:49:43,523 --> 00:49:47,569
All right, I'll scrub it before I go out.

389
00:49:50,989 --> 00:49:53,199
Could you stop being so quiet?

390
00:50:05,086 --> 00:50:07,881
You seem so depressed.

391
00:50:10,091 --> 00:50:11,843
I'll treat you to a movie, okay?

392
00:50:19,434 --> 00:50:24,105
If you don't have any money,
I still have a few bucks.

393
00:50:27,108 --> 00:50:28,818
Are you broke?

394
00:50:31,112 --> 00:50:32,530
Maybe I could support you.

395
00:50:34,282 --> 00:50:37,702
My girlfriend's got a new job
at the Oriental Nightclub.

396
00:50:37,785 --> 00:50:40,788
She says it's easy
earning a living as a dance hostess.

397
00:50:40,872 --> 00:50:42,540
I wouldn't mind,

398
00:50:42,624 --> 00:50:44,834
but you'd have to pick me up
every night after work.

399
00:50:44,918 --> 00:50:47,295
- Then I'd be your "boy."
- Do you care?

400
00:50:47,962 --> 00:50:50,173
The important thing is to be happy.

401
00:50:50,256 --> 00:50:52,050
I wouldn't tell anybody.

402
00:50:59,015 --> 00:51:00,433
Still want to go to a movie?

403
00:51:01,309 --> 00:51:02,518
Let's go.

404
00:51:02,602 --> 00:51:05,813
Okay, but I want to fix my hair first.

405
00:51:09,067 --> 00:51:10,652
You don't have to change?

406
00:51:11,444 --> 00:51:12,779
Wait, my slippers--

407
00:51:16,824 --> 00:51:18,826
I had breakfast with Old Man this morning.

408
00:51:18,910 --> 00:51:20,620
He realized I was in a bad mood.

409
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:22,872
He asked me to go to the States with him.

410
00:51:26,292 --> 00:51:27,794
I know very well

411
00:51:28,753 --> 00:51:30,338
that at my age...

412
00:51:32,507 --> 00:51:35,677
it's hard to find someone you really like.

413
00:51:37,804 --> 00:51:39,722
Old Man treats me so well.

414
00:51:40,723 --> 00:51:42,100
So that's that.

415
00:51:45,144 --> 00:51:48,690
He's quite old, but he's kindhearted.

416
00:51:48,773 --> 00:51:50,191
What do you think?

417
00:51:54,862 --> 00:51:56,823
I won't be coming back.

418
00:51:58,157 --> 00:52:00,576
If you want, you can come along.

419
00:52:01,536 --> 00:52:04,122
I won't force you if you don't want to.

420
00:52:04,205 --> 00:52:06,749
Of course you won't force me.

421
00:52:07,709 --> 00:52:09,210
You're the one who wants to leave.

422
00:52:11,087 --> 00:52:12,380
Stop dreaming.

423
00:52:14,465 --> 00:52:16,259
You force me to stay
with you all these years,

424
00:52:16,342 --> 00:52:18,136
and now suddenly you're leaving.

425
00:52:19,387 --> 00:52:20,847
I won't let you go.

426
00:52:21,931 --> 00:52:24,809
I've taken care of you for so many years.

427
00:52:24,892 --> 00:52:26,269
I won't abandon you now.

428
00:52:28,062 --> 00:52:29,772
I've arranged everything for you.

429
00:52:29,856 --> 00:52:31,441
I'll leave you the house.

430
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,861
I'll send you money every month.

431
00:52:39,907 --> 00:52:41,451
I don't want anything.

432
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:43,661
I just want you to stay.

433
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:47,915
You always wanted to keep me with you,

434
00:52:49,584 --> 00:52:51,878
so there's no way
I'll let you go now either.

435
00:52:54,714 --> 00:52:56,924
- If you dare to try--
- Are you threatening me?

436
00:52:57,842 --> 00:53:00,762
All right.
I don't really want to go anyway.

437
00:53:02,347 --> 00:53:04,098
I'll be old in a few years.

438
00:53:04,932 --> 00:53:06,392
You gonna take care of me?

439
00:53:07,518 --> 00:53:09,062
With what?

440
00:53:09,145 --> 00:53:10,396
Doesn't matter.

441
00:53:11,105 --> 00:53:14,108
If I can't, we'll just starve
to death together.

442
00:53:15,651 --> 00:53:17,487
That's your dream anyway, isn't it?

443
00:53:18,154 --> 00:53:19,864
You're really something, you know?

444
00:53:21,574 --> 00:53:24,452
You've fought me all these years.

445
00:53:25,411 --> 00:53:27,622
Can't you be a little nicer to me?

446
00:53:27,705 --> 00:53:31,626
In that case, you shouldn't have
let me know I was adopted.

447
00:53:34,754 --> 00:53:36,464
Then everything would've been fine.

448
00:53:38,633 --> 00:53:40,593
But you told me a little and hid the rest.

449
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:47,058
I just want to know who my parents are.

450
00:53:48,142 --> 00:53:49,685
But you won't tell me.

451
00:53:52,397 --> 00:53:54,232
Don't you know you're giving me
an excuse to hate you?

452
00:53:54,315 --> 00:53:56,734
Fine! Go find out yourself then!

453
00:53:56,818 --> 00:53:59,654
The Philippines isn't that big.
Go and look!

454
00:53:59,737 --> 00:54:01,072
You just don't dare!

455
00:54:01,155 --> 00:54:03,408
You're afraid you'll find out
your mother isn't rich

456
00:54:03,491 --> 00:54:04,617
or from a famous family.

457
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:06,285
Maybe worse than me!

458
00:54:11,624 --> 00:54:13,167
That's none of your business.

459
00:54:14,168 --> 00:54:17,004
I'll keep pushing until you tell me.

460
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:19,674
We can keep playing this game forever.

461
00:54:21,676 --> 00:54:24,804
You'll have to tell me
the truth one of these days.

462
00:54:26,013 --> 00:54:28,516
I won't be as happy
to hear it from others.

463
00:54:29,058 --> 00:54:30,601
It has to be you.

464
00:54:31,936 --> 00:54:33,354
Unless maybe you die first.

465
00:54:34,355 --> 00:54:36,107
Then it won't matter anymore.

466
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:52,623
I should never have said anything.

467
00:54:55,418 --> 00:54:56,794
I told you

468
00:54:58,463 --> 00:55:00,214
because you're not my own blood,

469
00:55:00,965 --> 00:55:03,092
and I know sooner or later
you'll leave me.

470
00:55:06,012 --> 00:55:09,223
I always thought I'd be all right.

471
00:55:11,893 --> 00:55:14,812
I never realized
I couldn't bear to see you leave.

472
00:55:23,905 --> 00:55:25,490
So I just never told you.

473
00:55:28,826 --> 00:55:30,453
That was selfish of me.

474
00:55:33,748 --> 00:55:37,418
But I meant well. I wanted to protect you.

475
00:55:39,045 --> 00:55:40,588
They didn't want you at all.

476
00:55:42,924 --> 00:55:44,467
If they really wanted you,

477
00:55:45,009 --> 00:55:46,594
they'd have come for you long ago.

478
00:55:48,888 --> 00:55:50,431
You wouldn't understand.

479
00:55:53,684 --> 00:55:56,729
I know you won't listen
to anything I say now.

480
00:56:00,608 --> 00:56:03,277
You've run wild all these years.

481
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:10,826
Now you want to blame me
and have your revenge.

482
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:12,537
Fine.

483
00:56:13,955 --> 00:56:16,791
I'll tell you who your mother is now.

484
00:56:16,874 --> 00:56:18,292
I've had it with you.

485
00:56:23,798 --> 00:56:26,676
You've always used it as an excuse before.

486
00:56:32,139 --> 00:56:34,600
Well, you can't use it any longer.

487
00:56:34,684 --> 00:56:36,060
You want to fly off?

488
00:56:37,311 --> 00:56:38,854
All right, fly.

489
00:56:38,938 --> 00:56:40,481
Fly as far as you can.

490
00:56:41,857 --> 00:56:45,570
But don't let me find out
you got cold feet.

491
00:58:26,462 --> 00:58:27,672
Made up your mind?

492
00:58:31,634 --> 00:58:33,344
I've said it many times,

493
00:58:35,262 --> 00:58:37,139
but now it's time to actually go.

494
00:58:39,809 --> 00:58:41,143
That's good.

495
00:58:43,479 --> 00:58:44,814
How long will you be gone?

496
00:58:48,401 --> 00:58:50,319
I don't know what will happen there...

497
00:58:53,155 --> 00:58:54,824
or when I'll be back.

498
00:58:59,995 --> 00:59:01,497
Take care of yourself.

499
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:10,172
Does she know you're leaving?

500
00:59:12,425 --> 00:59:14,802
I have to leave, whether she knows or not.

501
00:59:16,345 --> 00:59:19,432
If she comes around bothering you,
tell her I'm gone.

502
00:59:24,854 --> 00:59:26,021
Take these.

503
00:59:36,198 --> 00:59:37,742
I know you've always liked it.

504
00:59:40,453 --> 00:59:41,620
Take good care of it.

505
01:00:06,395 --> 01:00:07,646
Has he been here?

506
01:00:16,614 --> 01:00:18,574
I asked you if he's been here!

507
01:00:20,326 --> 01:00:21,994
Stop ignoring me!

508
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:25,039
I know you're seeing him!

509
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:29,794
Have you no self-respect?
He already said he doesn't want you!

510
01:00:29,877 --> 01:00:32,129
- Why can't you leave him alone?
- Are you done?

511
01:00:32,213 --> 01:00:34,673
He's left you now too, so go home and cry!

512
01:00:34,757 --> 01:00:36,300
Why come tell me about it?

513
01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:42,097
Okay, he treated me badly,
but did he treat you any better?

514
01:00:42,181 --> 01:00:43,599
Don't touch me!

515
01:00:44,099 --> 01:00:46,018
He treats all women the same!

516
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:01,450
You can stay a little while,
but I'm locking up soon.

517
01:01:33,065 --> 01:01:35,401
I really shouldn't have come.

518
01:01:35,484 --> 01:01:37,528
I shouldn't give you a chance to gloat.

519
01:01:39,989 --> 01:01:42,741
Still, I think he likes me a little more.

520
01:01:42,825 --> 01:01:45,369
For whatever reason, he left you for me.

521
01:01:50,749 --> 01:01:53,168
It's better to find some things out
sooner than later.

522
01:01:53,711 --> 01:01:55,546
You're the one crying now.

523
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:58,007
I got over it a long time ago.

524
01:02:17,443 --> 01:02:18,402
What is it?

525
01:02:21,989 --> 01:02:24,158
- Has your son come by?
- No.

526
01:02:25,534 --> 01:02:29,121
Then would you know
where I could find him?

527
01:02:29,204 --> 01:02:32,791
No, he never tells me anything.

528
01:02:36,629 --> 01:02:40,215
If you ever see him,

529
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:43,010
tell him Mimi's looking for him.

530
01:02:44,011 --> 01:02:46,138
He has my phone number.

531
01:02:49,767 --> 01:02:52,269
I don't know if I'll see him.

532
01:02:52,353 --> 01:02:54,271
I'm leaving tomorrow.

533
01:02:55,022 --> 01:02:56,815
Is he going with you?

534
01:03:07,451 --> 01:03:09,536
May I take a look at your place?

535
01:03:28,597 --> 01:03:32,017
He used to always ask me
to wait downstairs.

536
01:03:33,394 --> 01:03:35,145
I really wanted to know

537
01:03:36,105 --> 01:03:37,815
what this place looked like.

538
01:03:42,444 --> 01:03:44,530
It's like every other place.

539
01:03:50,452 --> 01:03:52,079
Am I being foolish?

540
01:03:52,579 --> 01:03:56,291
No, I was just like you when I was young.

541
01:03:56,917 --> 01:03:59,253
You want me to call you a cab?

542
01:03:59,336 --> 01:04:00,587
No, thanks.

543
01:04:57,311 --> 01:04:58,812
Oh, it's you.

544
01:04:58,896 --> 01:05:00,355
I thought it was Yuddy.

545
01:05:11,366 --> 01:05:12,868
He left for the Philippines.

546
01:06:00,499 --> 01:06:02,167
Why are you following me?

547
01:06:10,551 --> 01:06:12,386
Stop following me! Go away!

548
01:06:12,469 --> 01:06:14,304
I don't ever want to see you again!

549
01:06:14,805 --> 01:06:17,933
Why send me away? Why can't I follow you?

550
01:06:18,016 --> 01:06:21,228
- I don't want anything to happen to you!
- Stop being so good to me!

551
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:23,397
I told you before
not to fall in love with me!

552
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:25,732
What's going on? You taking over?

553
01:06:25,816 --> 01:06:28,902
You got his car and his girlfriend--
But do you deserve them?

554
01:06:28,986 --> 01:06:31,071
Just 'cause he's gone
doesn't mean I have to love you!

555
01:06:31,155 --> 01:06:32,573
I won't fall in love with you!

556
01:06:33,615 --> 01:06:35,242
What are you doing?

557
01:06:35,325 --> 01:06:38,745
Let me go!

558
01:06:38,829 --> 01:06:41,039
What do you want?

559
01:07:12,738 --> 01:07:14,865
I really want to go to the Philippines.

560
01:07:15,657 --> 01:07:16,575
I really do.

561
01:07:56,365 --> 01:07:57,532
Here.

562
01:08:07,376 --> 01:08:09,294
What's with all this money?

563
01:08:16,843 --> 01:08:21,306
Like you said,
you have to deserve something.

564
01:08:25,352 --> 01:08:27,479
He looked real good in the car.

565
01:08:30,607 --> 01:08:32,317
I looked like a joke.

566
01:08:36,738 --> 01:08:38,991
So it was better just to sell it.

567
01:08:54,381 --> 01:08:57,509
Go to the Philippines
if you really want to.

568
01:09:02,848 --> 01:09:05,017
And when you see Yuddy,
tell him I'm sorry.

569
01:09:05,767 --> 01:09:08,353
Tell him I couldn't handle the car,
so I sold it.

570
01:09:26,455 --> 01:09:28,373
And if you really can't find Yuddy...

571
01:09:43,597 --> 01:09:44,890
then come back to me.

572
01:10:40,821 --> 01:10:44,783
<i>On April 12, 1961,
I finally arrived at my mother's house.</i>

573
01:10:46,076 --> 01:10:47,911
<i>But she didn't want to see me.</i>

574
01:10:49,121 --> 01:10:51,415
<i>The maids told me
she no longer lived there.</i>

575
01:10:56,002 --> 01:10:58,213
<i>As I was leaving,</i>

576
01:10:58,296 --> 01:11:01,049
<i>I could feel a pair of eyes
watching me from behind,</i>

577
01:11:02,676 --> 01:11:04,886
<i>but I was determined not to turn around.</i>

578
01:11:08,181 --> 01:11:11,726
<i>I just wanted to find out
what she looked like.</i>

579
01:11:13,812 --> 01:11:15,772
<i>Since she wouldn't give me that chance,</i>

580
01:11:17,524 --> 01:11:19,651
<i>I wouldn't give it to her either.</i>

581
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:17,959
- You have a room?
- Thirty dollars a day.

582
01:12:18,043 --> 01:12:21,171
Five for an extra bed.
How long are you staying?

583
01:12:21,254 --> 01:12:23,256
Two days. I'm waiting for a ship.

584
01:12:29,095 --> 01:12:30,222
Thanks.

585
01:12:59,209 --> 01:13:00,377
<i>Who's there?</i>

586
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:06,174
Are you alone, mister?

587
01:13:08,927 --> 01:13:10,136
You done now?

588
01:13:18,645 --> 01:13:19,771
What?

589
01:13:33,159 --> 01:13:34,452
It's stuck.

590
01:13:42,836 --> 01:13:46,172
Hey, you gonna fall asleep
on me right here?

591
01:13:46,881 --> 01:13:48,216
Easy!

592
01:13:50,677 --> 01:13:53,096
You gonna sleep here?

593
01:13:53,179 --> 01:13:56,308
A lot of people walk by here.

594
01:13:57,517 --> 01:13:58,602
Hey!

595
01:14:00,729 --> 01:14:02,147
Are you serious?

596
01:14:08,361 --> 01:14:10,822
You're really gonna fall asleep on me.

597
01:14:11,740 --> 01:14:14,034
Well, it's up to you.

598
01:14:50,236 --> 01:14:51,738
You haven't gone out?

599
01:14:53,448 --> 01:14:54,574
I just came back.

600
01:15:00,038 --> 01:15:01,331
Is someone with you?

601
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:04,626
Just a friend.

602
01:15:15,804 --> 01:15:17,430
Am I in the way?

603
01:15:19,224 --> 01:15:20,266
No.

604
01:15:28,650 --> 01:15:30,110
She's not bad.

605
01:15:38,243 --> 01:15:39,619
You ever stayed here before?

606
01:15:41,538 --> 01:15:43,373
You know how small Chinatown is.

607
01:15:44,582 --> 01:15:47,627
Lots of people come and stay here.

608
01:15:47,711 --> 01:15:49,546
Almost everyone ends up staying here.

609
01:15:51,131 --> 01:15:52,507
Did you come from Hong Kong?

610
01:15:53,383 --> 01:15:54,467
Yeah.

611
01:15:56,302 --> 01:15:57,554
What do you do?

612
01:15:58,638 --> 01:15:59,806
I'm a sailor.

613
01:16:02,642 --> 01:16:03,727
How long?

614
01:16:06,438 --> 01:16:08,064
I just changed jobs.

615
01:16:08,773 --> 01:16:10,442
I used to be a cop before.

616
01:16:11,484 --> 01:16:12,652
Not bad.

617
01:16:14,654 --> 01:16:17,157
Why'd you switch from cop to sailor?

618
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:23,371
Oh... just wanted to wander around.

619
01:16:24,664 --> 01:16:25,707
Anyway...

620
01:16:27,167 --> 01:16:29,002
how long have you been in the Philippines?

621
01:16:29,711 --> 01:16:30,837
A few months.

622
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:37,844
What for? You working?

623
01:16:39,846 --> 01:16:41,389
I hate work.

624
01:16:44,851 --> 01:16:46,269
I'm looking for my family.

625
01:16:48,688 --> 01:16:49,856
Did you find them?

626
01:16:51,441 --> 01:16:52,776
Something like that.

627
01:16:55,945 --> 01:16:59,324
Even my watch is gone. What's the time?

628
01:17:05,455 --> 01:17:06,623
3:30.

629
01:17:10,376 --> 01:17:11,711
Shall we go have a drink?

630
01:17:13,630 --> 01:17:15,548
No, thanks. It's late.

631
01:17:18,426 --> 01:17:22,764
If it's too late to go back to your place,
why not just stay here?

632
01:17:22,847 --> 01:17:25,558
I have wine here. Help yourself.

633
01:17:28,269 --> 01:17:29,437
I don't have a place.

634
01:17:31,189 --> 01:17:34,192
Anyway, I have to be
at the station at dawn.

635
01:17:34,943 --> 01:17:36,694
That's just a few hours from now.

636
01:17:37,445 --> 01:17:40,198
Better to drink the hours away than sleep.

637
01:17:43,660 --> 01:17:45,161
You heading somewhere else?

638
01:17:47,705 --> 01:17:49,958
I get bored staying in one place too long.

639
01:17:50,041 --> 01:17:52,669
Like you said, I like to wander around.

640
01:17:54,295 --> 01:17:55,713
Want some?

641
01:17:59,175 --> 01:18:00,426
Thanks.

642
01:18:02,095 --> 01:18:03,513
When will you go back?

643
01:18:06,057 --> 01:18:08,518
When they finish unloading the cargo.

644
01:18:08,601 --> 01:18:11,521
Probably take about two days.

645
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:14,524
How about you? Are you going back?

646
01:18:15,692 --> 01:18:16,818
Maybe.

647
01:18:17,777 --> 01:18:21,781
Even if I wanted to,
it wouldn't be for a while.

648
01:18:24,492 --> 01:18:27,120
Maybe we'll run into each other
in Hong Kong.

649
01:18:28,371 --> 01:18:30,206
Might not even recognize each other.

650
01:18:32,292 --> 01:18:33,793
I hope that doesn't happen.

651
01:18:44,971 --> 01:18:46,598
Have I seen you somewhere before?

652
01:18:51,853 --> 01:18:55,231
Don't remember. My memory's not so good.

653
01:19:03,448 --> 01:19:04,657
Mine neither.

654
01:19:09,245 --> 01:19:12,999
Get out of here! Go!

655
01:20:06,094 --> 01:20:07,136
Hey.

656
01:20:08,137 --> 01:20:10,306
What train are you taking?

657
01:20:11,975 --> 01:20:13,601
I didn't say I was.

658
01:20:17,772 --> 01:20:19,649
If you're not taking a train,

659
01:20:22,819 --> 01:20:24,487
why'd you come to the station?

660
01:20:25,113 --> 01:20:26,447
I'm meeting someone.

661
01:20:33,121 --> 01:20:35,123
He and I have something to discuss.

662
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:40,586
I owe you this one. It's on me next time.

663
01:21:08,948 --> 01:21:10,700
It's an American passport.

664
01:21:10,783 --> 01:21:13,870
That's a big deal! Worth a lot of money.

665
01:21:14,954 --> 01:21:17,206
I've killed a lot of people.

666
01:21:17,290 --> 01:21:19,917
But that's part of my job, you know.

667
01:21:20,001 --> 01:21:22,503
Now, where is my money?

668
01:21:23,546 --> 01:21:24,630
Money?

669
01:21:27,508 --> 01:21:28,968
I don't have your money.

670
01:21:43,483 --> 01:21:44,734
That was fast.

671
01:21:46,944 --> 01:21:48,196
Stop him!

672
01:21:48,780 --> 01:21:49,781
Run!

673
01:22:24,398 --> 01:22:26,275
You ever been to the States?

674
01:22:30,571 --> 01:22:31,864
Why aren't you talking?

675
01:22:33,658 --> 01:22:35,201
Worried you'll miss your ship?

676
01:22:36,369 --> 01:22:38,412
Not everyone's like you.

677
01:22:38,496 --> 01:22:40,623
You don't have a care in the world,

678
01:22:40,706 --> 01:22:42,291
but I have to earn a living.

679
01:22:46,879 --> 01:22:50,174
If you want a passport, pay for it!

680
01:22:50,258 --> 01:22:52,343
If you don't have money,
don't start trouble!

681
01:22:52,426 --> 01:22:53,845
We could have died back there!

682
01:22:55,096 --> 01:22:57,223
Back there?

683
01:22:57,306 --> 01:23:00,685
You could die any minute.
This train could derail.

684
01:23:00,768 --> 01:23:02,145
How can you predict it?

685
01:23:03,896 --> 01:23:06,065
If you're tired of living, fine.

686
01:23:06,858 --> 01:23:08,484
But don't drag me down with you.

687
01:23:08,568 --> 01:23:11,279
Hey, I told you to take off back there,

688
01:23:11,362 --> 01:23:13,030
but here you are tagging along.

689
01:23:13,906 --> 01:23:16,242
I wish you'd been killed,
you son of a bitch!

690
01:23:19,745 --> 01:23:23,082
- You ever hear of a bird that--
- Yes.

691
01:23:23,166 --> 01:23:24,792
The one with no legs.

692
01:23:25,585 --> 01:23:27,962
Maybe you can fool girls with that story.

693
01:23:28,546 --> 01:23:30,089
Think you're some kind of bird?

694
01:23:31,257 --> 01:23:32,675
Which part of you?

695
01:23:34,510 --> 01:23:37,972
You're just the drunk I picked
out of the garbage in Chinatown!

696
01:23:38,890 --> 01:23:40,600
Think you're a bird?

697
01:23:41,601 --> 01:23:43,936
If you could fly,
you wouldn't have to be here.

698
01:23:49,150 --> 01:23:50,568
Go ahead, fly!

699
01:23:51,277 --> 01:23:53,154
Show me how you fly.

700
01:23:54,822 --> 01:23:56,240
You'll see.

701
01:23:58,367 --> 01:24:00,369
Just don't be jealous when it happens.

702
01:24:09,503 --> 01:24:11,505
Tell me,

703
01:24:11,923 --> 01:24:14,383
how long till the next station?

704
01:24:14,467 --> 01:24:17,553
I don't understand you. Say again.

705
01:24:47,708 --> 01:24:50,002
<i>That day when I left the hospital,</i>

706
01:24:50,836 --> 01:24:53,339
<i>I felt very relieved.</i>

707
01:24:55,508 --> 01:24:58,177
<i>My financial worries were over.</i>

708
01:24:59,929 --> 01:25:02,974
<i>I'd receive 50 American dollars
every month</i>

709
01:25:03,975 --> 01:25:07,019
<i>until the child turned 18.</i>

710
01:25:12,650 --> 01:25:15,528
<i>I've always wanted to know what I'd see
the last moment of my life.</i>

711
01:25:18,698 --> 01:25:21,701
So I mustn't close my eyes when I die.

712
01:25:26,414 --> 01:25:27,581
What about you?

713
01:25:30,251 --> 01:25:32,795
What do you wanna see most
the moment your life ends?

714
01:25:37,300 --> 01:25:38,884
Life is so long.

715
01:25:40,428 --> 01:25:42,305
There's a lot I haven't seen yet.

716
01:25:44,348 --> 01:25:46,058
I don't know.

717
01:25:46,142 --> 01:25:48,311
I don't know what I want to see.

718
01:25:51,314 --> 01:25:52,732
Give it some thought.

719
01:25:55,818 --> 01:25:57,737
It's gotta be boring at sea anyway.

720
01:26:00,239 --> 01:26:02,074
Life isn't really that long.

721
01:26:05,077 --> 01:26:07,330
Now's the time to start thinking about it.

722
01:26:24,096 --> 01:26:27,683
<i>I used to think
there was some kind of bird</i>

723
01:26:27,767 --> 01:26:30,394
<i>that flew and flew,
never touching down until it died.</i>

724
01:26:31,312 --> 01:26:33,397
<i>But that bird never
actually flew anywhere,</i>

725
01:26:34,148 --> 01:26:36,609
<i>because it was dead
from the very beginning.</i>

726
01:26:39,195 --> 01:26:40,988
<i>I said I'd never be able to tell</i>

727
01:26:41,072 --> 01:26:43,199
<i>which woman
I loved the most until the end.</i>

728
01:26:45,826 --> 01:26:47,620
<i>I wonder what she's doing now.</i>

729
01:26:51,374 --> 01:26:52,917
<i>It's dawn.</i>

730
01:26:54,418 --> 01:26:56,587
<i>Looks like quite a beautiful day.</i>

731
01:26:57,505 --> 01:26:59,965
<i>I wonder what sunset will be like.</i>

732
01:27:03,552 --> 01:27:05,638
<i>The last time I saw him,</i>

733
01:27:07,306 --> 01:27:08,974
<i>I asked him a question.</i>

734
01:27:14,897 --> 01:27:18,734
You remember what you were doing

735
01:27:18,818 --> 01:27:21,112
on April 16th of last year at 3:00 p.m.?

736
01:27:22,405 --> 01:27:23,739
Why do you ask?

737
01:27:25,032 --> 01:27:26,242
No reason.

738
01:27:26,992 --> 01:27:29,703
A friend of mine used to test my memory

739
01:27:30,704 --> 01:27:34,417
and asked me what I did that day.

740
01:27:36,752 --> 01:27:39,422
I couldn't remember. What about you?

741
01:27:41,757 --> 01:27:43,259
Did she tell you?

742
01:27:48,139 --> 01:27:49,890
I thought you'd forgotten.

743
01:27:51,767 --> 01:27:53,978
I remember what should be remembered.

744
01:27:56,647 --> 01:27:58,399
Did you see each other a lot?

745
01:28:01,527 --> 01:28:02,987
For a time.

746
01:28:04,905 --> 01:28:08,159
But once I changed jobs, we lost touch.

747
01:28:14,248 --> 01:28:15,499
What about you?

748
01:28:16,208 --> 01:28:17,418
Me?

749
01:28:18,627 --> 01:28:19,837
No.

750
01:28:22,131 --> 01:28:24,049
What else did she tell you?

751
01:28:27,678 --> 01:28:28,929
Nothing.

752
01:28:31,056 --> 01:28:33,225
We really didn't know
each other that long.

753
01:28:36,270 --> 01:28:37,563
Do you love her?

754
01:28:43,027 --> 01:28:46,071
No, we're just friends.

755
01:28:49,116 --> 01:28:52,620
When you see her again,
tell her I remember nothing.

756
01:28:54,955 --> 01:28:56,916
It's better that way for all of us.

757
01:29:00,419 --> 01:29:02,838
I don't even know
if I'll ever see her again.

758
01:29:06,967 --> 01:29:08,636
Even if I do...

759
01:29:12,264 --> 01:29:13,891
she may not recognize me.

760
01:29:46,966 --> 01:29:50,761
You've come here all by yourself.
Aren't you afraid?

761
01:29:53,389 --> 01:29:55,933
I heard everyone
from Hong Kong stays here.

762
01:29:56,016 --> 01:29:58,352
There's someone I want to ask you about.
