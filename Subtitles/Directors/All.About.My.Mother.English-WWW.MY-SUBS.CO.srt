1
00:02:07,131 --> 00:02:09,292
I'm going to call.

2
00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:13,560
TRANSPLANT COORDINATION

3
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,548
National Transplant
Organization.

4
00:02:27,619 --> 00:02:29,917
- Manuela, Ramón y Cajal Hospital.
- Yes.

5
00:02:29,988 --> 00:02:32,115
We've got a possible donor.

6
00:02:35,593 --> 00:02:37,686
Give me the details.

7
00:02:37,762 --> 00:02:40,424
Male, 35 years old.

8
00:02:40,498 --> 00:02:41,795
Blood group?

9
00:02:41,866 --> 00:02:44,767
"O" positive.
Weight, about 150 pounds.

10
00:02:47,772 --> 00:02:49,433
LIVER

11
00:02:54,379 --> 00:02:56,210
LIVER RECIPIENTS

12
00:03:03,988 --> 00:03:05,979
<i>Not a single drop!</i>

13
00:03:08,893 --> 00:03:11,521
<i>- With Dodoti Diapers...
- Dodotis!</i>

14
00:03:11,596 --> 00:03:13,154
<i>you won't feel a drop!</i>

15
00:03:18,536 --> 00:03:19,730
- Mom!
- What?

16
00:03:19,804 --> 00:03:21,431
The movie's starting.

17
00:03:21,506 --> 00:03:23,497
I'm coming.

18
00:03:28,947 --> 00:03:31,939
Eve Unveiled

19
00:03:32,016 --> 00:03:33,881
They always change the title!

20
00:03:33,952 --> 00:03:36,386
"All About Eve" should be
"Todo Sobre Eva."

21
00:03:37,021 --> 00:03:38,955
But that sounds odd.

22
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:49,891
What are you writing?

23
00:03:49,968 --> 00:03:51,333
Nothing.

24
00:03:52,637 --> 00:03:54,161
Future Pulitzer winners.

25
00:03:54,238 --> 00:03:56,069
ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER

26
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,608
Eat up. You have to put on
a few pounds.

27
00:03:58,676 --> 00:04:02,043
Some day you may have
to work the street to keep me.

28
00:04:02,513 --> 00:04:05,676
You don't need pounds for that.
You need a big dick.

29
00:04:06,417 --> 00:04:08,783
Where did you learn
to talk like that?

30
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:12,046
- You asked.
- I was joking.

31
00:04:14,525 --> 00:04:16,959
- And you?
- What about me?

32
00:04:17,028 --> 00:04:19,588
Would you prostitute yourself
for me?

33
00:04:21,132 --> 00:04:24,101
I've already done
just about everything for you.

34
00:04:26,771 --> 00:04:28,466
Eat up!

35
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:35,306
<i>They're little beasts
that run in packs like coyotes.</i>

36
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,972
<i>They're your fans.</i>

37
00:04:37,048 --> 00:04:38,709
<i>They're nobody's fans.</i>

38
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:41,809
<i>They're juvenile delinquents,
mental defectives.</i>

39
00:04:41,886 --> 00:04:43,080
<i>Fans, indeed!</i>

40
00:04:43,154 --> 00:04:46,521
<i>They never see a play or a movie.
They're never indoors long enough.</i>

41
00:04:46,591 --> 00:04:49,025
<i>Well, there's one indoors
right now.</i>

42
00:04:49,093 --> 00:04:51,926
<i>I brought her back to see you.
Come in, Eve.</i>

43
00:04:53,831 --> 00:04:55,662
<i>I thought you'd forgotten
about me.</i>

44
00:04:55,733 --> 00:04:57,132
<i>Not at all.</i>

45
00:04:57,201 --> 00:04:59,135
<i>Margo,
this is Eve Harrington.</i>

46
00:04:59,203 --> 00:05:01,603
<i>- How do you do, my dear?
- Hello.</i>

47
00:05:01,673 --> 00:05:04,039
Would you like to be
an actress?

48
00:05:04,108 --> 00:05:06,668
It was hard enough
becoming a nurse.

49
00:05:06,744 --> 00:05:09,235
If you were an actress,
I'd write parts for you.

50
00:05:10,048 --> 00:05:12,516
I was in an amateur group
when I was young.

51
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:14,744
I wasn't bad.

52
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:16,787
I must have a picture
somewhere.

53
00:05:17,689 --> 00:05:19,850
I'd love to see it.

54
00:05:20,525 --> 00:05:22,254
I'll look for it later.

55
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,327
Look, Esteban.

56
00:05:30,401 --> 00:05:32,494
I found a picture.

57
00:05:36,207 --> 00:05:39,472
We were doing a show
based on texts by Boris Vian.

58
00:05:40,445 --> 00:05:42,936
Cabaret for intellectuals.

59
00:05:55,727 --> 00:05:57,217
Happy birthday!

60
00:05:57,295 --> 00:06:00,059
- Already?
- It's midnight, sweetheart.

61
00:06:01,332 --> 00:06:04,324
"Music for Chameleons."
How did you know I wanted it?

62
00:06:05,303 --> 00:06:06,964
I know you like Capote.

63
00:06:07,605 --> 00:06:09,596
Read me something,
like when I was little.

64
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,106
"Preface.

65
00:06:17,281 --> 00:06:19,511
I started writing
when I was eight."

66
00:06:19,584 --> 00:06:21,745
See? I'm not the only one.

67
00:06:22,553 --> 00:06:25,078
"I didn't know
that I had chained myself for life...

68
00:06:25,156 --> 00:06:28,091
to a noble
but merciless master.

69
00:06:28,159 --> 00:06:31,754
When God hands you a gift,
he also hands you a whip...

70
00:06:33,331 --> 00:06:36,994
and the whip is intended
only for self-flagellation."

71
00:06:37,935 --> 00:06:40,096
That's enough
to put you off writing.

72
00:06:40,171 --> 00:06:42,036
Don't be so lame.

73
00:06:42,106 --> 00:06:45,098
It's a wonderful preface.

74
00:06:45,176 --> 00:06:48,407
How do you want
to celebrate your birthday?

75
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,709
I'd like to see
one of your seminars.

76
00:06:50,782 --> 00:06:52,306
Why?

77
00:06:52,383 --> 00:06:55,409
I'm writing a story about you
for a competition.

78
00:06:56,354 --> 00:07:00,791
And I'd like to see you act
in those organ donation courses.

79
00:07:00,858 --> 00:07:04,021
Well, I'd have to check
with Mamen.

80
00:07:04,095 --> 00:07:06,290
She's the psychologist
in charge of the seminar.

81
00:07:06,364 --> 00:07:08,332
Fine. Do it.

82
00:07:09,767 --> 00:07:12,497
I don't think I like you writing
about me.

83
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:15,061
Your husband is dead, ma'am.

84
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:17,437
That's impossible.

85
00:07:17,508 --> 00:07:20,238
We just saw him in the ICU.
He seemed to be breathing.

86
00:07:20,311 --> 00:07:24,771
We've explained that, ma'am.
A machine is breathing for him.

87
00:07:24,849 --> 00:07:27,841
<i>Would you like us
to contact your family?</i>

88
00:07:28,619 --> 00:07:30,416
<i>I don't have any family.</i>

89
00:07:31,122 --> 00:07:33,249
<i>Just my son.</i>

90
00:07:34,058 --> 00:07:36,856
<i>My God!
How am I going to tell him?</i>

91
00:07:36,928 --> 00:07:39,362
<i>When he was alive,
did your husband say anything...</i>

92
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,898
<i>regarding organ donation?</i>

93
00:07:41,966 --> 00:07:44,799
Did he care about such matters?

94
00:07:44,869 --> 00:07:47,235
When we was alive,
he cared only about living.

95
00:07:48,306 --> 00:07:52,402
But I presume he was concerned
with the lives of others.

96
00:07:53,177 --> 00:07:54,667
I don't understand.

97
00:07:54,745 --> 00:07:58,704
What my colleague means
is that your husband's organs...

98
00:07:58,783 --> 00:08:01,115
<i>could save other patients' lives.</i>

99
00:08:01,185 --> 00:08:03,779
<i>But we need
your authorization for that.</i>

100
00:08:03,855 --> 00:08:07,086
<i>You could give him
a transplant?</i>

101
00:08:07,158 --> 00:08:10,559
<i>Not exactly.
The other way around, actually.</i>

102
00:08:20,171 --> 00:08:24,301
Now we'll discuss
what happened in the simulation.

103
00:09:07,752 --> 00:09:09,743
Look when you cross the street!

104
00:09:10,755 --> 00:09:13,087
- What were you thinking?
- I had an idea.

105
00:09:13,157 --> 00:09:15,523
An idea!
Give him the tickets.

106
00:09:20,831 --> 00:09:23,493
<i>Why are you looking at me like that?
Do I look awful?</i>

107
00:09:23,567 --> 00:09:26,365
<i>No, you look better than ever.</i>

108
00:09:26,437 --> 00:09:30,032
<i>Look, that must be
the gentleman you were expecting.</i>

109
00:09:30,107 --> 00:09:32,473
You aren't Mr. Huntleigh!

110
00:09:33,577 --> 00:09:35,772
Neither are you!

111
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:55,596
These fingernails will have
to be trimmed.

112
00:09:57,368 --> 00:09:58,596
The jacket, Doctor.

113
00:09:58,669 --> 00:10:01,399
Ask her to let go of me!

114
00:10:01,472 --> 00:10:02,461
Please!

115
00:10:03,908 --> 00:10:05,899
Let her go.

116
00:10:10,681 --> 00:10:12,911
Get up.

117
00:10:16,053 --> 00:10:18,521
Lean on my arm...

118
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:21,522
Miss DuBois.

119
00:10:21,592 --> 00:10:23,059
Thank you.

120
00:10:23,127 --> 00:10:24,617
Whoever you are...

121
00:10:24,695 --> 00:10:28,859
I have always depended
on the kindness of strangers.

122
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:42,142
Come on, baby.
The worst is over.

123
00:10:42,213 --> 00:10:44,909
Don't touch me.
Don't ever touch me again, bastard!

124
00:10:44,982 --> 00:10:46,779
Watch your language!

125
00:10:55,292 --> 00:10:57,317
Stella, come here.

126
00:11:01,032 --> 00:11:03,728
I'm never coming back
to this house.

127
00:11:06,604 --> 00:11:08,731
Never!

128
00:11:14,979 --> 00:11:17,277
I'd like to get
Huma Rojo's autograph.

129
00:11:17,348 --> 00:11:20,977
- In this weather?
- What's that got to do with it?

130
00:11:28,092 --> 00:11:29,821
What if nobody comes out?

131
00:11:29,894 --> 00:11:33,057
Let's wait a while.
It's my birthday.

132
00:11:33,898 --> 00:11:36,594
Look, autumn's here already.

133
00:11:37,334 --> 00:11:39,825
- So long.
- See you tomorrow.

134
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,409
Nina Cruz really moved you,
didn't she?

135
00:11:45,476 --> 00:11:48,502
No, not her. Stella.

136
00:11:48,846 --> 00:11:53,215
<i>Twenty years ago, we did Streetcar
with the drama group in my town.</i>

137
00:11:53,284 --> 00:11:55,548
I played Stella.

138
00:11:55,619 --> 00:11:57,746
Your father was Kowalski.

139
00:11:57,822 --> 00:12:01,019
Some day you'll have to tell me
all about my father.

140
00:12:01,092 --> 00:12:03,026
All I know is
he died before I was born.

141
00:12:03,094 --> 00:12:06,120
- It isn't an easy story to tell.
- I guess not.

142
00:12:06,197 --> 00:12:08,859
Or you'd have told me by now.

143
00:12:08,933 --> 00:12:11,902
I nearly asked for that
as a birthday present.

144
00:12:11,969 --> 00:12:13,937
I'm not sure
it would be a nice present.

145
00:12:14,004 --> 00:12:17,405
You're wrong.
It would be the best one.

146
00:12:20,044 --> 00:12:23,536
Then I'll tell you everything
when we get home.

147
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:28,279
Working in theater
is worse than being a nun!

148
00:12:30,554 --> 00:12:34,285
You think not being able to get stoned
all day is being a nun!

149
00:12:34,358 --> 00:12:35,791
Yeah, I do!

150
00:12:37,428 --> 00:12:39,919
Alfonso XII Street, number 30.

151
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,461
Come on, forget about it!

152
00:13:17,568 --> 00:13:19,468
My son!

153
00:13:47,131 --> 00:13:50,965
<i>Tomorrow I turn 17,
but I look older.</i>

154
00:13:51,035 --> 00:13:54,994
<i>Boys who live alone with their mothers
have a special look...</i>

155
00:13:55,072 --> 00:13:58,599
<i>more serious than normal,
like an intellectual or a writer.</i>

156
00:13:58,676 --> 00:14:02,476
<i>In my case that's normal,
because I'm also a writer.</i>

157
00:14:07,117 --> 00:14:08,982
"Intensive Care Unit"

158
00:14:12,723 --> 00:14:15,055
This is Lola, at Ramón y Cajal.

159
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,685
Yes?

160
00:14:17,761 --> 00:14:20,252
We've got a possible donor.
He's in the ICU.

161
00:14:20,331 --> 00:14:22,026
They've done the first EEG...

162
00:14:22,099 --> 00:14:24,795
but the mother hasn't given
her consent yet.

163
00:14:24,868 --> 00:14:26,460
Can I have the details?

164
00:14:26,537 --> 00:14:28,562
I don't have them.
It's Manuela's son.

165
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,040
The Manuela that I know?
The coordinator?

166
00:14:32,476 --> 00:14:35,036
Yes. He's dead.
It's awful.

167
00:14:57,568 --> 00:14:59,297
Unfortunately...

168
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,603
the result of the EEG
is what we'd feared.

169
00:15:15,152 --> 00:15:17,780
We have to make a decision
immediately.

170
00:15:21,292 --> 00:15:23,192
CONSENT BY NEXT OF KIN

171
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:56,422
OPERATING ROOM

172
00:15:59,897 --> 00:16:01,387
HEART

173
00:16:16,313 --> 00:16:19,214
It's from the hospital!

174
00:16:19,283 --> 00:16:20,910
We have to go.
We have to call.

175
00:16:20,984 --> 00:16:24,545
- I'll do it. You calm down.
- I am calm... but call them.

176
00:16:30,661 --> 00:16:34,597
ALVEDRO AIRPORT, CORUÑA

177
00:17:08,298 --> 00:17:12,200
REGIONAL HOSPITAL, CORUÑA

178
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:28,215
THREE WEEKS LATER

179
00:17:33,991 --> 00:17:36,323
We're outside now,
sweetheart.

180
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:37,950
We're out at last.

181
00:17:38,028 --> 00:17:40,690
He looks great.
Who'd have believed it?

182
00:17:40,764 --> 00:17:42,755
He certainly didn't.

183
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,630
I feel I can breathe
like before.

184
00:17:44,701 --> 00:17:47,329
- Even better.
- With an 18-year-old's heart!

185
00:17:47,404 --> 00:17:51,465
- I'll fix you some apple fritters.
- No, he has to be careful.

186
00:17:54,678 --> 00:17:57,476
<i>Last night, Mom showed me
a picture of when she was young.</i>

187
00:17:58,048 --> 00:18:00,073
<i>Half of it was missing.</i>

188
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:04,143
<i>I didn't want to tell her,
but my life is missing that same half.</i>

189
00:18:19,703 --> 00:18:21,967
I was worried.

190
00:18:22,473 --> 00:18:24,805
I thought you'd never call.

191
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:26,968
I called
as soon as I got to Madrid.

192
00:18:27,044 --> 00:18:28,705
I mean in Argentina.

193
00:18:28,779 --> 00:18:31,043
I called you loads of times...

194
00:18:31,114 --> 00:18:33,742
but I must have got
your aunt's number wrong.

195
00:18:34,518 --> 00:18:38,113
I wasn't in Argentina, Mamen.
I went to Coruña.

196
00:18:48,065 --> 00:18:50,192
Why did you go there?

197
00:18:52,936 --> 00:18:56,201
I went after my son's heart.

198
00:18:56,273 --> 00:18:59,242
Who told you?
How did you know?

199
00:18:59,309 --> 00:19:00,799
I looked in the files...

200
00:19:00,878 --> 00:19:04,279
until I found the name and address
of the transplant recipient.

201
00:19:04,348 --> 00:19:06,612
You shouldn't have.

202
00:19:06,683 --> 00:19:09,277
It was wrong,
and the best way to go crazy.

203
00:19:09,353 --> 00:19:11,412
- Look at me, damn it!
- I know that.

204
00:19:11,488 --> 00:19:14,423
The best thing for me
is to quit the NTO and leave Madrid.

205
00:19:14,491 --> 00:19:17,619
- I didn't say that.
- But you think it... and you're right.

206
00:19:18,695 --> 00:19:20,629
I think I won't even unpack.

207
00:19:20,697 --> 00:19:24,565
You're in no shape to travel alone.
You're ill.

208
00:19:24,635 --> 00:19:27,195
You have to rest up
and get better.

209
00:19:27,271 --> 00:19:29,034
I'll stay here tonight.

210
00:19:29,106 --> 00:19:32,633
- Then come home with me.
- I want to be alone, Mamen.

211
00:19:32,709 --> 00:19:35,371
- Try to be reasonable.
- How?

212
00:19:44,688 --> 00:19:48,089
<i>Seventeen years ago,
I made this same journey...</i>

213
00:19:48,158 --> 00:19:51,685
<i>but in the opposite direction,
from Barcelona to Madrid.</i>

214
00:19:52,362 --> 00:19:54,728
<i>I was running away then too...</i>

215
00:19:54,798 --> 00:19:56,561
<i>but I wasn't alone.</i>

216
00:19:57,401 --> 00:19:59,892
<i>I was carrying Esteban
inside me.</i>

217
00:20:01,071 --> 00:20:03,835
<i>I was running away
from his father then...</i>

218
00:20:04,207 --> 00:20:08,143
<i>and now I'm going
in search of him.</i>

219
00:21:13,276 --> 00:21:16,074
- Shall I keep going?
- Yes, go on.

220
00:22:39,663 --> 00:22:41,324
Stop!

221
00:22:45,035 --> 00:22:47,333
Son of a bitch!

222
00:22:55,712 --> 00:22:58,442
You're crazy, you faggot!

223
00:23:07,691 --> 00:23:09,454
Son of a bitch!

224
00:23:19,603 --> 00:23:23,130
- What did you do?
- I hit him with a stone.

225
00:23:23,673 --> 00:23:26,233
- Help me get him up.
- Get up. Come on.

226
00:23:27,844 --> 00:23:30,574
Come on, Juan. Get up.

227
00:23:30,647 --> 00:23:33,241
Are you all right?
Stand up.

228
00:23:33,817 --> 00:23:36,217
Let's get moving.

229
00:23:36,286 --> 00:23:38,720
Come on, quickly.

230
00:23:40,524 --> 00:23:43,550
What a fucking useless psychopath!

231
00:23:45,362 --> 00:23:47,057
Look.

232
00:23:49,766 --> 00:23:52,166
See that bonfire
where the "tops" are?

233
00:23:52,235 --> 00:23:53,827
Ask for Ursula.

234
00:23:53,904 --> 00:23:56,566
Tell her Agrado sent you.
She'll fix you up.

235
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,800
Agrado!

236
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:01,604
It's you!

237
00:24:01,678 --> 00:24:03,612
Manolita!

238
00:24:08,385 --> 00:24:09,852
You're hurt.

239
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,184
No, no, it's your blood.

240
00:24:12,255 --> 00:24:15,053
It isn't because you saved my life,
but how I've missed you!

241
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:18,424
Eighteen years... not a word,
not a letter, not a fucking call.

242
00:24:18,495 --> 00:24:20,622
I thought you were dead, bitch!

243
00:24:20,697 --> 00:24:22,426
You can tell me everything
at home.

244
00:24:22,499 --> 00:24:26,765
We'll stop by a drugstore first.
Can we get a taxi here?

245
00:24:26,837 --> 00:24:28,361
Over there.

246
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:31,330
With any luck,
we won't get mugged on the way.

247
00:24:31,408 --> 00:24:35,242
- You got the knife?
- Yes, and a rock in my purse.

248
00:24:38,248 --> 00:24:40,079
<i>Hey, there, bona nit.</i>

249
00:24:42,619 --> 00:24:45,281
Look, I'm sorry I woke you.

250
00:24:45,956 --> 00:24:48,481
- Hey, come over here.
- No. What do you want?

251
00:24:48,592 --> 00:24:52,050
- We're not going to eat you.
- What do you want?

252
00:24:52,162 --> 00:24:54,062
Let me do the talking.

253
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:57,725
Povidone-iodine,
approximation sutures...

254
00:24:57,801 --> 00:25:01,100
Thrombocid,
sterilized gauze and...

255
00:25:01,171 --> 00:25:04,197
- You got any alcohol?
- No, I drank it all last night.

256
00:25:04,307 --> 00:25:06,070
I mean for disinfecting.

257
00:25:06,142 --> 00:25:10,545
No. I've got Vaseline, condoms
and lots of bandages.

258
00:25:11,014 --> 00:25:13,778
- Anything else?
- Alcohol, please.

259
00:25:15,085 --> 00:25:18,316
Oh, Manolita!
The Barceloneta!

260
00:25:18,388 --> 00:25:20,856
Those were the days!
You remember?

261
00:25:21,458 --> 00:25:25,224
Yes.
Please, don't move your head.

262
00:25:27,664 --> 00:25:29,598
You know anything
about her?

263
00:25:29,666 --> 00:25:31,691
About who? Lola?

264
00:25:31,768 --> 00:25:34,532
- Unfortunately.
- What happened?

265
00:25:34,604 --> 00:25:36,435
I took her in.
She was in a bad way.

266
00:25:36,506 --> 00:25:39,566
As usual,
with all the shit she takes.

267
00:25:39,643 --> 00:25:41,770
I came back from working
the Field all night...

268
00:25:41,845 --> 00:25:44,040
and she'd cleaned the place out.

269
00:25:44,114 --> 00:25:47,242
Watches, jewelry, '70s magazines
that were my inspiration.

270
00:25:47,317 --> 00:25:49,046
300,000 pesetas.

271
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:50,814
What hurt most was...

272
00:25:50,887 --> 00:25:54,084
she took a statue of the Virgin
that my mother gave me.

273
00:25:54,157 --> 00:25:56,387
What for?
She doesn't believe in anything!

274
00:25:56,459 --> 00:26:00,486
Unless she's in a satanic sect
and wanted it for some ritual.

275
00:26:00,864 --> 00:26:02,798
I see she hasn't changed.

276
00:26:02,866 --> 00:26:05,494
To do that to me,
with all she owes me!

277
00:26:05,568 --> 00:26:08,969
Since we met in Paris 20 years ago,
I've been like a sister to her.

278
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:12,008
We got our tits together.
You know better than anyone.

279
00:26:14,878 --> 00:26:18,370
- You never saw her again?
- No, and I don't want to.

280
00:26:18,448 --> 00:26:20,109
Are you looking for her?

281
00:26:21,351 --> 00:26:23,046
Yes.

282
00:26:24,454 --> 00:26:26,285
We've got unsettled business.

283
00:26:28,858 --> 00:26:31,554
Why did you go off like that?

284
00:26:34,564 --> 00:26:36,464
Won't you tell me anything?

285
00:26:38,735 --> 00:26:40,726
I can't.

286
00:26:42,038 --> 00:26:43,562
Some other day.

287
00:26:44,307 --> 00:26:45,774
All right.

288
00:26:45,842 --> 00:26:47,571
Just don't disappear again.

289
00:26:48,478 --> 00:26:51,174
I like to say good-bye
to the people I love...

290
00:26:51,247 --> 00:26:54,216
even if it's only
to cry my eyes out, bitch.

291
00:27:17,007 --> 00:27:19,134
I can't believe it.

292
00:27:29,419 --> 00:27:31,410
I look like the Elephant Man!

293
00:27:32,355 --> 00:27:35,415
Don't exaggerate.
It's just a bit swollen.

294
00:27:35,492 --> 00:27:38,086
A bit swollen?
Where can I go with a mug like this?

295
00:27:38,862 --> 00:27:40,625
Come and eat something.

296
00:27:40,697 --> 00:27:43,222
Why did you go
to all this trouble?

297
00:27:43,299 --> 00:27:45,927
Salad... how wonderful!

298
00:27:46,236 --> 00:27:49,034
It really hurts to chew!

299
00:27:49,105 --> 00:27:50,595
I won't be able to suck.

300
00:27:50,673 --> 00:27:52,573
You shouldn't work today.

301
00:27:52,642 --> 00:27:54,269
What can I do?

302
00:27:54,344 --> 00:27:56,335
Lola cleaned me out.
I have to work.

303
00:27:56,413 --> 00:27:58,938
Look, caramel spread!
And meat pie!

304
00:27:59,015 --> 00:28:00,312
<i>And my provoleta.</i>

305
00:28:00,383 --> 00:28:02,044
I have to work too.

306
00:28:02,118 --> 00:28:04,211
If you want,
we can look together.

307
00:28:04,287 --> 00:28:05,879
Oh, yes!

308
00:28:07,557 --> 00:28:10,082
Since you left,
I haven't had a decent meal.

309
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:13,095
Well, also, as a model,
I have to watch my figure.

310
00:28:13,163 --> 00:28:16,030
The worst thing about this work
is you've got to look cute...

311
00:28:16,099 --> 00:28:20,832
and keep up with the latest advances
in surgery and cosmetics.

312
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:28,877
You look terrific!

313
00:28:28,945 --> 00:28:31,243
Nothing like a Chanel
to make you feel respectable.

314
00:28:31,314 --> 00:28:32,611
You look it.

315
00:28:33,316 --> 00:28:35,511
Don't I look a bit of a slut
in this suit?

316
00:28:35,585 --> 00:28:36,711
All the better.

317
00:28:36,786 --> 00:28:40,085
These nuns only help
whores and transvestites.

318
00:28:41,224 --> 00:28:42,987
Is that a real Chanel?

319
00:28:43,059 --> 00:28:47,792
No! How could I buy a real Chanel
with all the hunger in the world!

320
00:28:47,864 --> 00:28:50,355
All I have that's real
are my feelings...

321
00:28:50,433 --> 00:28:53,163
and these pints of silicone
that weigh a ton.

322
00:28:53,236 --> 00:28:56,228
I feel so old, Manolita,
and it isn't my age.

323
00:28:56,306 --> 00:28:58,672
It's because of the beating.

324
00:28:58,741 --> 00:29:02,006
The beating I've taken
for the last 40 years!

325
00:29:03,313 --> 00:29:05,543
- Hello.
- Come in.

326
00:29:05,615 --> 00:29:07,708
Are you looking for someone,
or can I help?

327
00:29:07,784 --> 00:29:09,843
We want to see the girl
who goes to the Field.

328
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:11,648
The cute one.

329
00:29:11,721 --> 00:29:13,848
Sister Rosa. She's inside.
Go on in.

330
00:29:13,923 --> 00:29:15,652
Thank you.

331
00:29:24,634 --> 00:29:26,727
Rosa, look. Visitors.

332
00:29:32,475 --> 00:29:34,136
What happened to your face?

333
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:36,770
Nothing. A beating.
Occupational hazard.

334
00:29:36,846 --> 00:29:38,973
- Can we talk?
- Of course.

335
00:29:39,048 --> 00:29:42,279
Let's go next door.
It's quieter.

336
00:29:42,352 --> 00:29:44,343
My friend and I want
to quit the street...

337
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,012
but we need to work.

338
00:29:46,089 --> 00:29:49,058
Cleaning stairs, whatever.
We don't care.

339
00:29:49,125 --> 00:29:50,456
There isn't much else.

340
00:29:50,527 --> 00:29:53,985
Well, garbage collector,
or learning handicrafts here.

341
00:29:54,063 --> 00:29:56,964
Embroidered tablecloths,
dried flowers.

342
00:29:57,033 --> 00:29:59,331
I think I prefer
garbage collector.

343
00:30:00,036 --> 00:30:01,833
What can you do,
apart from the street?

344
00:30:01,905 --> 00:30:03,839
I've worked as a cook.

345
00:30:03,907 --> 00:30:05,670
She's practically a surgeon.

346
00:30:05,742 --> 00:30:07,642
Look at this face.
She did it.

347
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:10,304
Better than Pitanguy.
She's a compatriot of Lola's.

348
00:30:10,647 --> 00:30:13,309
Really? Have you heard
anything about her?

349
00:30:14,017 --> 00:30:15,951
I haven't seen her in 18 years.

350
00:30:16,019 --> 00:30:17,953
She cleaned out my place.

351
00:30:18,021 --> 00:30:19,511
She was here.

352
00:30:19,589 --> 00:30:21,921
It must have been
about four months ago.

353
00:30:21,991 --> 00:30:24,425
We helped her through detox.

354
00:30:24,494 --> 00:30:26,325
I cared for her
through withdrawal...

355
00:30:26,396 --> 00:30:28,990
but then she just disappeared.

356
00:30:29,065 --> 00:30:32,057
I'd like to see her
before I go to El Salvador.

357
00:30:32,135 --> 00:30:33,966
El Salvador?

358
00:30:34,037 --> 00:30:35,629
Maybe I'll sign on.

359
00:30:35,705 --> 00:30:38,970
I always thought I could
make it big in the Third World.

360
00:30:39,375 --> 00:30:41,275
Then come with me.
I won't be so alone.

361
00:30:41,344 --> 00:30:43,710
The street's getting worse here
every day.

362
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:47,546
The whores were bad enough,
but the drag queens are wiping us out.

363
00:30:47,617 --> 00:30:49,710
I can't stand the drag queens.
They're sleazebags.

364
00:30:49,786 --> 00:30:52,016
They confuse transvestism
with a circus.

365
00:30:52,088 --> 00:30:53,851
Worse, with mime!

366
00:30:53,923 --> 00:30:56,483
A woman is her hair,
her nails...

367
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,527
lips for sucking or for bitching.

368
00:30:58,595 --> 00:31:01,428
I mean, have you ever seen
a bald woman?

369
00:31:01,497 --> 00:31:04,159
I can't stand them.
They're all sleazebags!

370
00:31:05,768 --> 00:31:07,759
I doubt there are
many drag queens in El Salvador...

371
00:31:07,837 --> 00:31:09,327
but they're
in the middle of a war.

372
00:31:09,405 --> 00:31:11,771
Yeah? I didn't know that.

373
00:31:12,742 --> 00:31:14,801
I'm replacing some nuns
who were murdered.

374
00:31:15,211 --> 00:31:18,806
I'm not sure
what I need right now is a war.

375
00:31:18,881 --> 00:31:21,179
You're terrible, Agrado.

376
00:31:22,018 --> 00:31:23,986
So you were a cook.

377
00:31:24,053 --> 00:31:25,111
Yes.

378
00:31:25,188 --> 00:31:26,917
Who? This one?

379
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:28,617
The best!

380
00:31:52,782 --> 00:31:54,340
What a surprise!

381
00:31:54,417 --> 00:31:55,907
Hi, Mom.

382
00:31:55,985 --> 00:31:57,384
Are we interrupting?

383
00:31:57,453 --> 00:31:59,717
It doesn't matter.
We see you so rarely.

384
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:05,091
- This is Manuela.
- Pleased to meet you.

385
00:32:05,161 --> 00:32:07,561
Come inside.
Don't just stand there.

386
00:32:09,565 --> 00:32:11,192
Mom, Manuela is a cook...

387
00:32:11,267 --> 00:32:13,667
and as Florinda's gone,
I thought...

388
00:32:13,736 --> 00:32:16,705
Thank you, darling.
Vicenta and I can manage.

389
00:32:16,773 --> 00:32:19,742
But how?
Dad alone needs two people.

390
00:32:19,809 --> 00:32:22,277
- Where is he?
- Out with the dog.

391
00:32:22,345 --> 00:32:23,812
- On their own?
- Of course.

392
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,177
What if they get lost?

393
00:32:25,248 --> 00:32:27,716
The dog knows the way home.
Don't worry.

394
00:32:27,784 --> 00:32:30,252
What a shame!
I really wanted to see them.

395
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,982
We'll go look for them,
but first we have to talk.

396
00:32:33,056 --> 00:32:34,148
Come into the studio.

397
00:32:34,223 --> 00:32:36,623
I'm sorry you came for nothing.

398
00:32:36,693 --> 00:32:38,888
- It's all right.
- Try her for a few days.

399
00:32:38,961 --> 00:32:41,452
Think of Dad.
Manuela's a nurse.

400
00:32:41,531 --> 00:32:42,862
- As well as a cook?
- Yes.

401
00:32:42,932 --> 00:32:45,696
I prefer to look
after your father myself.

402
00:32:45,768 --> 00:32:49,226
I understand.
Thank you anyway. I'll go.

403
00:32:49,305 --> 00:32:50,203
Good-bye.

404
00:32:50,273 --> 00:32:51,934
- Manuela.
- Yes?

405
00:32:52,008 --> 00:32:54,374
Wait here.
I won't be long.

406
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,080
How dare you bring
a whore here!

407
00:33:00,149 --> 00:33:03,141
It isn't easy to find help
who'll put up with you.

408
00:33:03,219 --> 00:33:04,618
But a whore!

409
00:33:04,687 --> 00:33:06,780
That's no reason
to be so rude.

410
00:33:06,856 --> 00:33:10,121
I don't like strangers
to see me forging Chagalls.

411
00:33:10,193 --> 00:33:11,820
Can't you understand?

412
00:33:11,894 --> 00:33:14,886
Manuela isn't a whore anymore.
She's given it up.

413
00:33:14,964 --> 00:33:16,454
How long have you known her?

414
00:33:16,933 --> 00:33:18,230
Since this morning.

415
00:33:18,668 --> 00:33:22,570
This morning?
You're incredible.

416
00:33:22,638 --> 00:33:24,401
My work is to help people...

417
00:33:24,474 --> 00:33:26,203
even if I've just met them.

418
00:33:26,275 --> 00:33:28,209
Well, mine isn't.

419
00:33:28,277 --> 00:33:31,075
Don't look at me like that.
It doesn't mean I'm intolerant.

420
00:33:32,281 --> 00:33:35,250
- I'll make you a deal.
- A deal?

421
00:33:35,318 --> 00:33:39,516
I'll give that woman a chance
if you don't go to El Salvador.

422
00:33:39,589 --> 00:33:42,285
Mom, don't give me any more doubts.
I've got enough.

423
00:33:42,358 --> 00:33:44,918
And so you should.
That trip is suicide!

424
00:33:44,994 --> 00:33:47,087
No, it's parricide!

425
00:33:47,163 --> 00:33:49,427
Well, I have to go.

426
00:33:49,499 --> 00:33:51,023
Manuela's waiting.

427
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:54,501
Sure! Any whore, any Salvadoran,
is more important than your parents!

428
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:58,267
- Don't start, Mom.
- You should go see a psychiatrist.

429
00:33:59,909 --> 00:34:02,503
It wouldn't do
either of us any harm.

430
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:06,341
Didn't you want to see
your father and the dog?

431
00:34:06,416 --> 00:34:08,281
Another day.

432
00:34:08,351 --> 00:34:10,216
Are you all right?

433
00:34:11,954 --> 00:34:14,445
Good-bye, Mom.

434
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,860
- Hello, Vicenta.
- Rosa, love.

435
00:34:26,936 --> 00:34:29,496
- You're so thin. Aren't you eating?
- Yes, I am.

436
00:34:29,572 --> 00:34:32,097
- Did you see a blonde girl downstairs?
- No.

437
00:34:33,142 --> 00:34:35,508
- So long.
- Take care... and eat!

438

<i>A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE</i>

439
00:34:53,062 --> 00:34:55,690
I'm sorry about my mother.

440
00:34:55,765 --> 00:34:58,029
I'm sorry.

441
00:34:59,635 --> 00:35:00,602
Shall we go?

442
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:04,071
I can't deal with my mother.
She drives me crazy.

443
00:35:04,774 --> 00:35:07,766
- Have you got parents?
- They're dead.

444
00:35:07,844 --> 00:35:10,005
So you're alone.

445
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:11,944
I guess so.

446
00:35:12,014 --> 00:35:13,709
You look awful.

447
00:35:13,783 --> 00:35:16,581
I don't feel very well.

448
00:35:16,652 --> 00:35:19,280
I want to throw up.

449
00:35:21,324 --> 00:35:22,985
I've got...

450
00:35:26,863 --> 00:35:28,592
Here.

451
00:35:28,664 --> 00:35:30,689
Have you seen the doctor?

452
00:35:32,168 --> 00:35:35,569
You should.
It may just be gastritis.

453
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:41,200
Can we go to your place
until this passes?

454
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:42,675
Well...

455
00:35:42,745 --> 00:35:44,372
Do you have a place?

456
00:35:44,447 --> 00:35:48,577
I've just rented one,
but it's barely furnished.

457
00:35:52,288 --> 00:35:54,916
It's quite a mess.

458
00:35:55,591 --> 00:35:58,082
I moved in four days ago.

459
00:35:58,361 --> 00:36:00,056
You want to lie down
for a while?

460
00:36:00,129 --> 00:36:02,859
No, I'll just sit here on the sofa...

461
00:36:02,932 --> 00:36:04,092
until it passes.

462
00:36:04,166 --> 00:36:06,031
I'm going to take this off.

463
00:36:08,271 --> 00:36:10,796
Who's this handsome boy?

464
00:36:12,708 --> 00:36:14,539
My son.

465
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,545
I thought you were alone.

466
00:36:19,615 --> 00:36:22,106
He died in an accident.

467
00:36:22,785 --> 00:36:25,379
Oh, I'm sorry!

00:36:28,591 --> 00:36:31,355
Don't touch the notebook,
please.

469
00:37:08,164 --> 00:37:10,064
Come on, baby.
The worst is over.

470
00:37:10,132 --> 00:37:13,363
Don't touch me!
Don't ever touch me again, bastard!

471
00:37:13,436 --> 00:37:15,427
Watch your language!

472
00:37:21,944 --> 00:37:23,741
Stella, come here.

473
00:37:23,813 --> 00:37:26,111
I'm never coming back
to this house.

00:37:26,182 --> 00:37:28,480
Never!

I'm not Nina.
I'm Manuela.

478
00:38:20,236 --> 00:38:22,397
You shouldn't be here.

479
00:38:22,471 --> 00:38:24,234
Nina's gone.

480
00:38:24,306 --> 00:38:25,739
What?

481
00:38:32,782 --> 00:38:34,443
Where's Nina?

482
00:38:34,517 --> 00:38:37,452
I don't know.
I just saw her run out.

483
00:38:41,023 --> 00:38:44,322
She said she'd wait for me
in her dressing room!

484
00:38:45,294 --> 00:38:47,728
I can't believe it.

485
00:38:51,667 --> 00:38:53,828
It's only been two weeks.

486
00:38:53,903 --> 00:38:56,337
She can't do this to me.

487
00:39:02,178 --> 00:39:03,941
Have you got a car?

488
00:39:04,013 --> 00:39:05,776
No. Where do you want to go?

489
00:39:07,349 --> 00:39:09,442
I don't know.

490
00:39:10,386 --> 00:39:11,614
Can you drive?

491
00:39:11,687 --> 00:39:12,915
Yes.

492
00:39:16,692 --> 00:39:19,684
Don't tell anyone,
but Nina's got problems with junk.

493
00:39:21,063 --> 00:39:24,396
Do you know where she'd go
to score at this time?

494
00:39:24,467 --> 00:39:26,731
No, but it's easy to find out.

495
00:39:26,802 --> 00:39:28,326
Thank you.

496
00:39:28,404 --> 00:39:29,928
Whoever you are...

497
00:39:30,005 --> 00:39:33,031
I have always depended
on the kindness of strangers.

498
00:39:35,044 --> 00:39:37,308
I can't drive.

499
00:39:37,379 --> 00:39:39,142
Nina does the driving.

500
00:39:39,215 --> 00:39:41,274
- Want one?
- No, thank you.

501
00:39:45,688 --> 00:39:48,521
I started smoking
because of Bette Davis.

502
00:39:48,591 --> 00:39:50,525
To imitate her.

503
00:39:50,593 --> 00:39:53,687
At 18, I was smoking
like a chimney.

504
00:39:54,163 --> 00:39:56,222
That's why
I called myself Huma.

505
00:39:56,298 --> 00:39:58,596
Huma's a very pretty name.

506
00:40:00,035 --> 00:40:02,299
Smoke is all there's been
in my life.

507
00:40:02,371 --> 00:40:04,771
You've had success too.

508
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,434
Success has got no taste
or smell.

509
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:10,707
And when you get used to it,
it's as if it didn't exist.

510
00:40:11,714 --> 00:40:14,808
God, where has that girl gone?

511
00:40:45,548 --> 00:40:47,209
I think that's her!

512
00:40:50,152 --> 00:40:52,643
You stay here. I'll go.

513
00:41:02,498 --> 00:41:05,467
He's a son of a bitch.
He rips everybody off.

514
00:41:05,534 --> 00:41:08,002
Yeah, and since I'm not
from here...

515
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:09,901
Don't touch me.

516
00:41:09,972 --> 00:41:11,940
Listen, Nina.

517
00:41:12,007 --> 00:41:14,407
Huma's waiting for you.

518
00:41:14,476 --> 00:41:16,603
Who the fuck are you?

519
00:41:16,679 --> 00:41:18,112
She's in the car.

520
00:41:34,496 --> 00:41:35,986
I got everything.

521
00:41:37,733 --> 00:41:40,497
- Fuck, my purse!
- Yeah, I got a purse.

522
00:41:40,569 --> 00:41:43,732
Ecstasy, toot.

523
00:42:08,063 --> 00:42:10,395
- Who is it?
- It's Rosa.

524
00:42:11,767 --> 00:42:13,428
- Hello.
- How are you?

525
00:42:13,502 --> 00:42:16,369
- Are you alone?
- I just got up.

526
00:42:16,438 --> 00:42:17,769
This late?

527
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,570
I was out late last night.

528
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:23,071
- Some breakfast?
- No, thanks.

529
00:42:23,145 --> 00:42:26,342
- Aren't you hungry?
- So you're back on the street.

530
00:42:26,415 --> 00:42:29,578
Just when I'd found
another way for you to earn money.

531
00:42:29,652 --> 00:42:31,449
Tell me.
I'm not a whore.

532
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,421
I've been fucked around a lot,
but I'm not a whore.

533
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:36,253
Why did you lie to me?

534
00:42:36,325 --> 00:42:39,419
It was Agrado's idea.
The dress was hers too.

535
00:42:39,495 --> 00:42:43,693
So tell me: What's this other way
for me to earn money?

536
00:42:43,766 --> 00:42:46,257
I'm dying of curiosity.

537
00:42:46,335 --> 00:42:48,860
How much would you charge
to rent me a room?

538
00:42:48,938 --> 00:42:51,202
To rent you a room?
Why?

539
00:42:51,273 --> 00:42:53,867
I'm going to leave the center
for a few months.

540
00:42:53,943 --> 00:42:56,537
What about El Salvador?

541
00:42:56,612 --> 00:42:59,137
I don't feel well.

542
00:42:59,214 --> 00:43:01,341
I can't travel like this.

543
00:43:01,417 --> 00:43:05,319
Why do you want to move in here
if you're ill?

544
00:43:07,957 --> 00:43:10,585
I'm pregnant.

545
00:43:11,593 --> 00:43:13,720
Pregnant?

546
00:43:13,796 --> 00:43:15,559
What are you going to do?

547
00:43:15,631 --> 00:43:18,395
Have it, of course.
What do you expect?

548
00:43:18,467 --> 00:43:20,867
I thought it'd be
less of a scandal here.

549
00:43:20,936 --> 00:43:23,063
Can't the father
help you out?

550
00:43:23,138 --> 00:43:25,663
The father!
God knows where he is.

551
00:43:25,741 --> 00:43:28,073
But you know who he is,
don't you?

552
00:43:28,143 --> 00:43:30,941
Of course.
Who do you take me for?

553
00:43:31,013 --> 00:43:32,742
I'm sorry.

554
00:43:33,182 --> 00:43:35,446
It was your compatriot Lola.

555
00:43:39,855 --> 00:43:42,221
That lousy, fucking bitch!

556
00:43:44,593 --> 00:43:46,925
What's come over you?

557
00:43:48,564 --> 00:43:50,964
What's come over me?

558
00:43:51,133 --> 00:43:52,794
How far along are you?

559
00:43:53,836 --> 00:43:56,327
Three months, I think.

560
00:43:56,405 --> 00:43:57,929
But I'm very worried.

561
00:43:58,007 --> 00:43:59,998
Worried?
I'm not surprised!

562
00:44:02,111 --> 00:44:03,874
I had bleeding this morning.

563
00:44:03,946 --> 00:44:05,106
Have you seen a doctor?

564
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:10,580
I'm going
to the Hospital del Mar tomorrow.

565
00:44:10,652 --> 00:44:12,779
I wanted to know
if you'd come with me.

566
00:44:13,422 --> 00:44:14,946
Yes, of course.

567
00:44:15,024 --> 00:44:17,151
Thank you.

568
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,619
What about the room?

569
00:44:21,597 --> 00:44:23,462
I'm sorry.

570
00:44:23,532 --> 00:44:26,092
You can't stay here.

571
00:44:46,722 --> 00:44:48,417
Good evening.
May I come in?

572
00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:50,720
Hello!
I was expecting you.

573
00:44:50,793 --> 00:44:52,761
I didn't know
where to send your purse.

574
00:44:52,828 --> 00:44:54,318
Here it is.

575
00:44:54,396 --> 00:44:56,125
Thank you.

576
00:45:00,035 --> 00:45:01,434
Is everything there?

577
00:45:01,503 --> 00:45:04,097
Yes, everything.

578
00:45:04,173 --> 00:45:05,970
- Thank you for last night.
- Not at all.

579
00:45:06,041 --> 00:45:08,475
I'd love to talk more,
but I'm short on time.

580
00:45:08,544 --> 00:45:10,705
- Can I help you?
- Could you button this?

581
00:45:10,779 --> 00:45:12,212
Of course.

582
00:45:12,281 --> 00:45:14,112
What was your name?

583
00:45:15,884 --> 00:45:17,818
Would you like
to work for me?

584
00:45:17,886 --> 00:45:21,049
- Doing what?
- Everything.

585
00:45:21,123 --> 00:45:24,559
Everything except sleep with me.
I've got enough with Nina.

586
00:45:24,626 --> 00:45:27,720
Well, the truth is
I was looking for a job.

587
00:45:27,796 --> 00:45:31,664
I need a personal assistant.
Someone I can trust.

588
00:45:31,733 --> 00:45:35,464
- You don't know me.
- What I saw last night was enough.

589
00:45:35,537 --> 00:45:37,402
But Nina hates me.

590
00:45:37,473 --> 00:45:40,636
Nina hates everyone,
including herself and me.

591
00:45:40,709 --> 00:45:42,472
Well...

592
00:45:43,846 --> 00:45:45,575
when do I start?

593
00:45:45,647 --> 00:45:48,207
- Right now, if you can.
- All right.

594
00:45:50,552 --> 00:45:52,679
Ask Nina what she wants
for dinner.

595
00:45:52,754 --> 00:45:55,484
<i>- I'll just have an esqueixada.
- Anything else?</i>

596
00:45:55,557 --> 00:45:59,323
Could you get a tranquilizer for Nina?
She's real edgy today.

597
00:45:59,394 --> 00:46:03,023
- I've got Lexatin.
- Terrific!

598
00:46:26,955 --> 00:46:29,150
Don't mention the father.

599
00:46:29,224 --> 00:46:31,658
Why do you dislike Lola so much?

600
00:46:31,727 --> 00:46:33,661
Lola's got the worst of a man...

601
00:46:33,729 --> 00:46:35,629
and the worst of a woman.

602
00:46:37,032 --> 00:46:38,897
I'll tell you a story.

603
00:46:40,235 --> 00:46:43,398
I had a friend
who got married very young.

604
00:46:43,472 --> 00:46:45,667
After a year, her husband
went to work in Paris...

605
00:46:45,741 --> 00:46:48,608
and he was to call her
when he got settled.

606
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:50,471
Two years passed.

607
00:46:50,546 --> 00:46:54,346
The husband saved some money
and came to Barcelona to open a bar.

608
00:46:54,683 --> 00:46:57,151
She came here to join him.

609
00:46:57,219 --> 00:46:59,585
Two years isn't a long time...

610
00:47:00,389 --> 00:47:02,880
but the husband had changed.

611
00:47:02,958 --> 00:47:05,290
He didn't love her anymore.

612
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:07,851
The change was more physical.

613
00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:11,024
He'd gotten a pair of tits
that were bigger than hers.

614
00:47:11,099 --> 00:47:13,329
Oh, I see.

615
00:47:14,836 --> 00:47:17,634
My friend was very young.

616
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:20,338
She was in a foreign land.

617
00:47:20,409 --> 00:47:23,003
She had no one.

618
00:47:23,979 --> 00:47:27,005
Apart from the tits,
the husband hadn't changed that much...

619
00:47:27,082 --> 00:47:30,677
so she ended up accepting him.

620
00:47:32,554 --> 00:47:36,752
Women will do anything
to avoid being alone.

621
00:47:36,825 --> 00:47:40,158
Women are more tolerant,
but that's good.

622
00:47:40,229 --> 00:47:42,390
We're assholes...

623
00:47:42,464 --> 00:47:44,159
and a bit lesbo.

624
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,468
Listen to the end
of the story.

625
00:47:48,036 --> 00:47:50,561
My friend
and her husband with the tits...

626
00:47:50,639 --> 00:47:53,836
set up a bar here,
on the Barceloneta.

627
00:47:54,676 --> 00:47:58,806
He spent the day in a tiny bikini,
screwing everything he could...

628
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,848
and giving her a hard time
if she wore a bikini...

629
00:48:00,916 --> 00:48:03,441
or even a miniskirt.

630
00:48:03,518 --> 00:48:05,213
The bastard!

631
00:48:05,287 --> 00:48:08,882
How could someone act so macho
with a pair of tits like that?

632
00:48:15,897 --> 00:48:17,888
Sit down.

633
00:48:17,966 --> 00:48:20,457
- Who is the patient?
- She is.

634
00:48:20,535 --> 00:48:21,832
Well?

635
00:48:24,239 --> 00:48:25,900
My sister is pregnant.

636
00:48:25,974 --> 00:48:29,137
We reckon she's about
three months along.

637
00:48:29,211 --> 00:48:31,839
This is her first checkup.

638
00:48:32,347 --> 00:48:34,338
Yesterday and today
I bled a little.

639
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:38,942
Lie down on the couch,
and strip from the waist down.

640
00:48:39,688 --> 00:48:41,815
Don't worry.

641
00:48:45,294 --> 00:48:47,558
- Put this on.
- Thank you.

642
00:48:49,865 --> 00:48:53,164
According to the ultrasound,
the fetus seems to be fine.

643
00:48:53,235 --> 00:48:54,896
Do you live together?

644
00:48:54,970 --> 00:48:56,335
- No.
- Yes.

645
00:48:56,405 --> 00:48:58,032
Which is it?

646
00:48:58,106 --> 00:49:02,008
She lives with our mother,
but she hasn't told her anything yet.

647
00:49:02,077 --> 00:49:03,840
Is your blood pressure
usually high?

648
00:49:03,912 --> 00:49:05,709
Yes, I have hypertension.

649
00:49:07,149 --> 00:49:09,982
There's a risk of miscarriage.

650
00:49:10,852 --> 00:49:12,945
You must move
as little as possible.

651
00:49:14,556 --> 00:49:16,683
But I've got to do my job.

652
00:49:16,758 --> 00:49:21,593
Your only job now is to rest
and not do anything stupid.

653
00:49:22,297 --> 00:49:24,788
Tell your mother
to watch her blood pressure.

654
00:49:24,866 --> 00:49:28,131
She has to follow a salt-free diet
and rest.

655
00:49:28,203 --> 00:49:30,228
I'll tell her.

656
00:49:30,305 --> 00:49:34,173
Listen, Doctor, I work
with people who are high-risk...

657
00:49:34,242 --> 00:49:38,008
so I'd like to have
an AIDS test as well.

658
00:49:38,513 --> 00:49:40,003
What's your job?

659
00:49:40,549 --> 00:49:42,744
She's a social worker.

660
00:49:42,818 --> 00:49:45,048
When can we pick up
the results?

661
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:47,588
In two weeks' time.

662
00:49:48,757 --> 00:49:50,987
You have to tell your mother.

663
00:49:51,059 --> 00:49:53,619
You need to be looked after.

664
00:49:53,695 --> 00:49:56,960
I found a job yesterday,
and I'm going to be busy all day.

665
00:49:57,032 --> 00:49:59,023
Listen.

666
00:49:59,101 --> 00:50:01,626
You've no right
to ask me to be your mother.

667
00:50:01,703 --> 00:50:03,728
You've already got one,
even if you don't like her.

668
00:50:03,805 --> 00:50:06,797
We can't choose our parents.
They are who they are.

669
00:50:08,944 --> 00:50:10,605
Oh, God!

670
00:50:12,314 --> 00:50:15,477
Please, don't blackmail me!

671
00:50:20,856 --> 00:50:23,484
<i>I don't know if I was right
to call the clinic.</i>

672
00:50:24,493 --> 00:50:26,927
<i>What else could you do?</i>

673
00:50:26,995 --> 00:50:29,486
<i>I can't believe her
and go on living with Stanley.</i>

674
00:50:29,564 --> 00:50:33,022
Then don't believe her.
What matters is you and your baby.

675
00:50:33,101 --> 00:50:34,830
What if she told me
the truth?

676
00:50:34,903 --> 00:50:36,234
Blanche?

677
00:50:36,304 --> 00:50:38,704
Blanche is in no shape
to tell the truth...

678
00:50:38,774 --> 00:50:41,538
even if she wanted to,
poor thing.

679
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:46,070
Where is my heart?

680
00:50:46,148 --> 00:50:48,810
She means her jewel box.
It's heart-shaped.

681
00:50:48,884 --> 00:50:51,910
I think it's here somewhere.
Look, here it is.

682
00:50:53,722 --> 00:50:57,317
- I need a necklace.
- We'll look for it.

683
00:50:59,828 --> 00:51:02,023
What's the gentleman's name?

684
00:51:02,097 --> 00:51:03,894
Huntleigh.

685
00:51:03,965 --> 00:51:06,024
Did he call
while I was in the bathroom?

686
00:51:06,101 --> 00:51:09,264
- No.
- How strange!

687
00:51:12,207 --> 00:51:15,540
Why are you looking at me like that?
Do I look awful?

688
00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:18,977
No, you look better than ever.

689
00:51:20,816 --> 00:51:23,717
- I'll look better with this necklace.
- Shall I help you?

690
00:51:26,688 --> 00:51:28,747
<i>So you're going on a trip.</i>

691
00:51:28,824 --> 00:51:32,157
<i>You're so lucky.
I'm green with envy.</i>

692
00:51:34,396 --> 00:51:35,886
<i>There he is.</i>

693
00:51:35,964 --> 00:51:39,024
<i>That must be the gentleman
who's come for you.</i>

694
00:51:46,007 --> 00:51:49,909
TWO WEEKS LATER

695
00:51:56,351 --> 00:51:59,377
- Second call. Fifteen minutes.
- Come in.

696
00:52:01,022 --> 00:52:03,115
- Aren't they here yet?
- I don't where they are.

697
00:52:03,191 --> 00:52:05,989
I was at the TV studio all day.

698
00:52:07,229 --> 00:52:08,787
- Where's Nina?
- Wasn't she with you?

699
00:52:08,864 --> 00:52:10,695
I just left her at home, in bed.

700
00:52:10,765 --> 00:52:12,630
- In bed?
- What's wrong?

701
00:52:12,701 --> 00:52:15,465
I think it's food poisoning.
She was so ill this morning.

702
00:52:15,537 --> 00:52:17,971
Why didn't you tell me
when I called?

703
00:52:18,039 --> 00:52:20,064
We didn't want to upset you.

704
00:52:20,141 --> 00:52:22,041
- Has a doctor seen her?
- Yes.

705
00:52:22,110 --> 00:52:26,274
She's got gastroenteritis,
but she'll be fine tomorrow.

706
00:52:26,348 --> 00:52:27,542
So we cancel the show?

707
00:52:27,616 --> 00:52:30,585
I'd like to speak to Huma,
please.

708
00:52:30,652 --> 00:52:31,710
Yes, wait outside.

709
00:52:32,554 --> 00:52:33,714
Five minutes.

710
00:52:33,822 --> 00:52:35,414
All right!

711
00:52:36,992 --> 00:52:40,484
- Tell me the truth.
- She's bombed. She can't even speak.

712
00:52:40,562 --> 00:52:44,191
She went out after you did.
She didn't know I'd drop by.

713
00:52:44,266 --> 00:52:46,530
She thought I'd be with you.

714
00:52:47,636 --> 00:52:49,570
What do we do now?

715
00:52:52,474 --> 00:52:55,637
If it won't give you a heart attack,
I could do her part.

716
00:52:56,745 --> 00:52:59,373
I know it by heart
from hearing it over the loudspeakers.

717
00:52:59,981 --> 00:53:01,710
But can you act?

718
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:05,745
I can lie very well,
and I'm used to improvising.

719
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:07,151
I've seen that.

720
00:53:08,356 --> 00:53:10,449
My son said
I was a very good actress.

721
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:14,624
I didn't even know
you had a son!

722
00:53:15,597 --> 00:53:18,623
Third call. Five minutes.

723
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:21,294
Huma, what'll we do?
We can't wait any longer.

724
00:53:27,943 --> 00:53:30,070
Happy birthday, Blanche.

725
00:53:30,145 --> 00:53:31,908
This is your present.

726
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:35,108
Thank you, Stanley.
Why did you bother?

727
00:53:35,183 --> 00:53:37,276
I hope you like it.

728
00:53:38,153 --> 00:53:39,643
Why, it's...

729
00:53:39,721 --> 00:53:41,689
A bus ticket.

730
00:53:41,756 --> 00:53:43,656
A return ticket for Tuesday.

731
00:53:45,093 --> 00:53:47,220
Are you insinuating
I should leave?

732
00:53:47,295 --> 00:53:49,263
What do you think?

733
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:59,262
- Why did you do that to her?
- I'm sick of her insults.

734
00:53:59,341 --> 00:54:03,107
I'm tired of you two whispering
behind my back all the time!

735
00:54:03,311 --> 00:54:05,040
Please, don't go!

736
00:54:05,113 --> 00:54:07,638
- Let go. You've torn my shirt!
- Brute!

737
00:54:07,716 --> 00:54:10,412
Brute?
I was a brute when we met.

738
00:54:10,485 --> 00:54:13,750
But I'd remind you
that it was never a problem for you.

739
00:54:13,822 --> 00:54:16,154
One day you showed me
a picture of your house...

740
00:54:16,224 --> 00:54:18,590
a mansion with lots of columns.

741
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:21,959
I pulled you down off those columns
and taught you to be happy.

742
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:24,828
We laughed
and were happy together...

743
00:54:24,899 --> 00:54:28,062
until your sister Blanche
appeared.

744
00:54:28,136 --> 00:54:30,161
What's wrong?

745
00:54:31,306 --> 00:54:34,139
Take me to the hospital, please!

746
00:55:04,239 --> 00:55:07,640
Congratulations on last night.
I heard you were great.

747
00:55:07,709 --> 00:55:10,269
You can't imagine.
What a pity you weren't there.

748
00:55:11,379 --> 00:55:14,712
I felt awful.
Agrado called to tell me about it.

749
00:55:14,783 --> 00:55:17,013
She must have called
half of Barcelona!

750
00:55:17,085 --> 00:55:20,316
Are you doing everything
the doctor told you?

751
00:55:21,256 --> 00:55:23,816
- I just saw him.
- And?

752
00:55:24,659 --> 00:55:27,992
- I went for my results.
- I forgot it was today.

753
00:55:38,173 --> 00:55:39,731
I'm HIV positive.

754
00:55:41,176 --> 00:55:42,837
We'll have the tests redone.

755
00:55:45,747 --> 00:55:48,272
Why the hell
did you screw Lola?

756
00:55:48,850 --> 00:55:51,842
Don't you know
she's been shooting up for 15 years?

757
00:55:52,153 --> 00:55:55,520
What world do you think
you're living in?

758
00:56:02,397 --> 00:56:03,796
I don't know.

759
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:07,663
Have you spoken
to your mother?

760
00:56:13,742 --> 00:56:14,970
Your colleagues?

761
00:56:16,911 --> 00:56:19,141
No.

762
00:56:41,402 --> 00:56:45,168
We'll go for your things now,
and you'll move in here.

763
00:56:47,375 --> 00:56:49,775
Thank you.

764
00:57:01,289 --> 00:57:02,517
- Hello.
- Hello, Alex.

765
00:57:02,590 --> 00:57:05,423
You were terrific last night.

766
00:57:05,493 --> 00:57:07,358
Thank you.

767
00:57:09,664 --> 00:57:12,792
- Good evening.
- Here's Miss Goody Two-shoes.

768
00:57:12,867 --> 00:57:15,131
- What's up?
- What's up?

769
00:57:15,203 --> 00:57:16,864
You planned it all, you bitch!

770
00:57:16,938 --> 00:57:18,633
Nina, don't be so rude.

771
00:57:18,706 --> 00:57:22,233
Just like Eve Harrington.
You learned the part on purpose.

772
00:57:22,310 --> 00:57:25,302
It's fucking impossible to learn it
over the loudspeakers.

773
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:27,245
You think I'm stupid?

774
00:57:27,315 --> 00:57:29,909
The loudspeakers helped me
remember it.

775
00:57:29,984 --> 00:57:32,009
I've known the part of Stella
for years.

776
00:57:32,353 --> 00:57:35,550
- Really? What a coincidence!
- If you only knew.

777
00:57:35,623 --> 00:57:36,988
What did I tell you?

778
00:57:37,058 --> 00:57:39,049
Why were you here
that first night?

779
00:57:39,127 --> 00:57:41,061
Or was that
a coincidence too?

780
00:57:41,563 --> 00:57:43,155
No, it wasn't a coincidence.

781
00:57:47,335 --> 00:57:51,135
I won't bother you anymore.
I'll get my things and go.

782
00:57:51,506 --> 00:57:55,840
Manuela, I think you owe us
an explanation.

783
00:58:06,421 --> 00:58:08,889
<i>A Streetcar Named Desire
has marked my life.</i>

784
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:15,693
Twenty years ago, I played Stella
with an amateur group.

785
00:58:16,698 --> 00:58:19,030
That's where I met
my husband.

786
00:58:20,101 --> 00:58:23,127
He was playing Kowalski.

787
00:58:24,305 --> 00:58:27,797
Two months ago,
I saw your version in Madrid.

788
00:58:30,879 --> 00:58:33,473
I went with my son.

789
00:58:34,816 --> 00:58:37,979
It was the night
of his birthday.

790
00:58:38,653 --> 00:58:40,951
It was pouring rain,
but we waited outside...

791
00:58:41,022 --> 00:58:43,388
because he wanted
your autograph, Huma.

792
00:58:53,434 --> 00:58:55,595
It was crazy
to wait in the rain...

793
00:58:55,670 --> 00:58:59,265
but it was his birthday,
so I couldn't say no.

794
00:59:01,276 --> 00:59:05,042
You two got in a taxi,
and he ran after you.

795
00:59:07,916 --> 00:59:11,283
A car coming along the street
ran him down.

796
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:15,180
He was killed.

797
00:59:15,290 --> 00:59:17,554
That's the explanation.

798
00:59:17,625 --> 00:59:20,321
That's the explanation, Huma.

799
00:59:37,011 --> 00:59:39,536
Move, Rosa.
I can't get past.

800
00:59:39,614 --> 00:59:41,582
What are you doing here?

801
00:59:41,649 --> 00:59:44,277
Hello. I came to pay you.

802
00:59:44,352 --> 00:59:46,183
You left yesterday
without your money.

803
00:59:46,921 --> 00:59:48,445
This is my sister Rosa.

804
00:59:48,523 --> 00:59:50,423
- Hello.
- How are you?

805
00:59:50,491 --> 00:59:52,288
Let me help you.

806
00:59:52,927 --> 00:59:54,861
Let's get the elevator.

807
00:59:54,929 --> 00:59:59,593
- Where's Nina?
- I left her with Mario. She says hi.

808
01:00:02,437 --> 01:00:04,564
Leave the bags here.

809
01:00:07,575 --> 01:00:09,566
You go and rest for a while,
Rosa.

810
01:00:09,644 --> 01:00:12,010
- I'm not tired.
- Don't argue.

811
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:14,373
Sit down.

812
01:00:15,550 --> 01:00:19,008
- Anything to drink?
- No, thank you.

813
01:00:19,921 --> 01:00:22,219
She's like a little girl.

814
01:00:26,227 --> 01:00:29,128
I couldn't sleep all night
thinking about your son.

815
01:00:29,197 --> 01:00:32,132
I can remember his face
in the rain perfectly...

816
01:00:32,533 --> 01:00:34,364
and the notebook
in his hand.

817
01:00:35,370 --> 01:00:36,997
I can see him now.

818
01:00:38,239 --> 01:00:40,537
I don't want to talk
about my son.

819
01:00:41,342 --> 01:00:42,536
I can't.

820
01:00:46,581 --> 01:00:49,914
Apart from apologizing,
Nina and I want you to come back.

821
01:00:50,818 --> 01:00:53,048
Rosa's sick.

822
01:00:53,121 --> 01:00:55,282
She needs someone
to look after her all day.

823
01:00:55,356 --> 01:00:58,814
I can't leave her.
I'm sorry.

824
01:00:58,893 --> 01:01:01,157
I don't know what I should do.

825
01:01:02,130 --> 01:01:04,826
Why don't you check Nina
into a clinic?

826
01:01:10,772 --> 01:01:13,832
If we don't fulfill the contract,
the company will sue me.

827
01:01:14,442 --> 01:01:16,433
Find a replacement...

828
01:01:16,511 --> 01:01:18,502
and finish your run
with the company.

829
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:21,642
I can't do the play
without Nina.

830
01:01:22,884 --> 01:01:25,910
She's hooked on junk,
but I'm hooked on her.

831
01:01:36,764 --> 01:01:39,528
- Who was it?
- Agrado.

832
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:41,397
And you let her in?

833
01:01:42,570 --> 01:01:44,367
You should have said
we were busy.

834
01:01:44,439 --> 01:01:46,100
I'm thinking of you.

835
01:01:46,174 --> 01:01:49,371
Come on, lie down here
and stop moving around.

836
01:01:49,444 --> 01:01:51,139
What exactly
is wrong with you?

837
01:01:51,212 --> 01:01:52,941
An accident.

838
01:01:54,015 --> 01:01:55,573
What kind?

839
01:01:55,650 --> 01:01:59,313
Why didn't I think of it before?
Agrado could take my place.

840
01:01:59,387 --> 01:02:00,376
Of course!

841
01:02:00,455 --> 01:02:02,423
The one you didn't want
to let in?

842
01:02:03,424 --> 01:02:06,291
That's something between us,
but she's perfect for you.

843
01:02:11,332 --> 01:02:13,163
How old is Agrado?

844
01:02:13,234 --> 01:02:16,362
Pretty old.
Between thirty and fifty.

845
01:02:16,437 --> 01:02:17,961
Is Agrado her real name?

846
01:02:18,039 --> 01:02:20,769
No, it's a stage name.
Like Huma.

847
01:02:22,510 --> 01:02:24,341
You know why
I took the name Huma?

848
01:02:24,412 --> 01:02:25,845
Yes.

849
01:02:25,913 --> 01:02:27,403
Manuela told me.

850
01:02:28,483 --> 01:02:30,314
What else did she tell you?

851
01:02:30,384 --> 01:02:32,614
Everything.
She told me everything.

852
01:02:32,687 --> 01:02:34,484
About you and Nina...

853
01:02:34,555 --> 01:02:36,546
the junk...

854
01:02:36,624 --> 01:02:38,615
and that it'll end badly.

855
01:02:39,260 --> 01:02:41,660
Really?
And what else did she say?

856
01:02:41,729 --> 01:02:43,219
I'm very curious.

857
01:02:43,331 --> 01:02:45,390
That as an actress,
you're wonderful...

858
01:02:47,635 --> 01:02:50,331
but that as a person,
you're very mixed up.

859
01:02:53,407 --> 01:02:54,772
And what else?

860
01:02:58,246 --> 01:02:59,941
That I shouldn't say anything.

861
01:03:01,782 --> 01:03:03,773
What have you got
in the bag?

862
01:03:03,851 --> 01:03:06,012
- Cava and ice cream.
- What for?

863
01:03:06,087 --> 01:03:08,521
To celebrate your success
last night, bitch.

864
01:03:08,589 --> 01:03:10,523
Thank you. Come in.

865
01:03:15,329 --> 01:03:17,593
Oh, what a surprise!

866
01:03:17,665 --> 01:03:20,156
Three single girls
in an empty house...

867
01:03:20,234 --> 01:03:22,600
<i>always reminds me of
How To Marry A Millionaire.</i>

868
01:03:22,670 --> 01:03:25,070
- How are you, Sister Rosa?
- Huma, this is Agrado.

869
01:03:25,139 --> 01:03:27,039
My pleasure. I'm "fans."

870
01:03:27,108 --> 01:03:28,336
How are you?

871
01:03:28,409 --> 01:03:32,038
Huma, you're a goddess,
a living legend.

872
01:03:32,113 --> 01:03:34,206
Like I said, I'm "fans,"
in the plural...

873
01:03:34,282 --> 01:03:37,740
but my Manuela was too much
the other night.

874
01:03:37,818 --> 01:03:41,413
How I bawled
at the evening show!

875
01:03:42,156 --> 01:03:44,147
Shouldn't you be
in El Salvador?

876
01:03:44,225 --> 01:03:47,058
Yes, but I'm not going now.
I'm staying here.

877
01:03:47,128 --> 01:03:49,562
Agrado, I don't work
for Huma anymore.

878
01:03:49,630 --> 01:03:53,657
Before you came, we were saying
that you could take my place.

879
01:03:54,268 --> 01:03:55,735
Me play Stella?

880
01:03:55,803 --> 01:03:57,794
I see myself more as Blanche.

881
01:03:59,307 --> 01:04:01,639
Replacing me, not Nina,
and much less Huma.

882
01:04:02,210 --> 01:04:03,939
Thank you, Manuela,
but I don't...

883
01:04:04,011 --> 01:04:06,741
Try her for a few days.
She isn't as clueless as she seems.

884
01:04:06,814 --> 01:04:10,341
I am, Huma, and worse.
Right now, I don't get this at all.

885
01:04:11,819 --> 01:04:14,879
So I'll give you the bottle
to cheer us up a bit.

886
01:04:14,956 --> 01:04:16,082
I brought ice cream.

887
01:04:16,157 --> 01:04:20,150
Come on, let's have a drink
and relax a bit.

888
01:04:20,228 --> 01:04:21,490
I'll get the glasses.

889
01:04:26,033 --> 01:04:28,661
I'll just have some ice cream.
I can't drink alcohol.

890
01:04:28,736 --> 01:04:30,363
Well, I'll have a drink.

891
01:04:30,438 --> 01:04:34,602
Hey, what's up with Manuela?
She seems very odd.

892
01:04:34,675 --> 01:04:37,269
Success hasn't gone
to her head already, has it?

893
01:04:38,613 --> 01:04:40,547
She wants to dump you
on Huma.

894
01:04:45,620 --> 01:04:48,020
I think Prada
is ideal for a nun.

895
01:04:48,089 --> 01:04:51,388
My problem is everything suits me,
so I'm very eclectic.

896
01:04:51,459 --> 01:04:53,757
I've had chilblains
since I came to Barcelona.

897
01:04:53,828 --> 01:04:55,227
Oh, really?

898
01:04:55,296 --> 01:04:57,560
It's finished.
Should I get more?

899
01:04:57,632 --> 01:05:00,100
I'd love some, but no.

900
01:05:00,167 --> 01:05:02,260
- Where's the bathroom?
- Straight ahead.

901
01:05:03,337 --> 01:05:04,929
Excuse me.

902
01:05:07,275 --> 01:05:11,143
Fill me in on what's happening here.
I'm no stranger.

903
01:05:11,212 --> 01:05:13,112
- I'll tell you tomorrow.
- No, don't!

904
01:05:13,180 --> 01:05:14,943
She can't keep her mouth shut.

905
01:05:15,016 --> 01:05:17,177
I know very well
how to keep it shut.

906
01:05:17,251 --> 01:05:20,550
I played along like an English lady
so she wouldn't catch on.

907
01:05:20,621 --> 01:05:24,751
I'm a model of discretion,
even when I'm sucking someone's cock.

908
01:05:24,825 --> 01:05:26,918
I've sucked a lot of cocks
in public places...

909
01:05:26,994 --> 01:05:29,087
and no one's noticed,
except the person involved.

910
01:05:30,231 --> 01:05:32,392
It's been ages
since I sucked a cock!

911
01:05:37,705 --> 01:05:40,105
I love the word "cock."

912
01:05:40,174 --> 01:05:42,199
And "prick"!

913
01:05:44,145 --> 01:05:45,373
I have to go.

914
01:05:45,446 --> 01:05:46,936
- Are you all right?
- What?

915
01:05:47,014 --> 01:05:48,743
- Are you all right?
- Better than ever.

916
01:05:48,816 --> 01:05:51,580
Can you help her
find a taxi?

917
01:05:52,186 --> 01:05:54,882
I nearly forgot.
This is for you.

918
01:05:54,955 --> 01:05:56,320
Thank you.

919
01:05:56,957 --> 01:05:59,084
- Well, good-bye, girls.
- So long.

920
01:06:03,831 --> 01:06:06,356
You have to teach me
how to bark.

921
01:06:07,234 --> 01:06:11,432
I think I was a bit rude to Huma.
I said all sorts of things.

922
01:06:11,505 --> 01:06:13,973
Really?
It doesn't matter.

923
01:06:14,041 --> 01:06:16,475
They're very different for sisters,
aren't they?

924
01:06:16,544 --> 01:06:19,707
- Are they sisters?
- That's what Manuela said.

925
01:06:19,780 --> 01:06:21,714
Well, if she says so.

926
01:06:21,782 --> 01:06:25,616
- I think you're all bullshitters.
- You have to get to know us.

927
01:06:26,087 --> 01:06:27,679
Can you drive?

928
01:06:27,755 --> 01:06:30,622
- I used to be a truck driver.
- Really?

929
01:06:30,691 --> 01:06:32,659
In Paris, before I got my tits.

930
01:06:32,727 --> 01:06:35,560
Then I gave up the truck
and became a whore.

931
01:06:35,629 --> 01:06:38,393
- How interesting.
- Very.

932
01:06:42,203 --> 01:06:44,296
A check.

933
01:06:44,372 --> 01:06:47,102
- 150,000.
- How generous!

934
01:06:51,846 --> 01:06:53,780
What is it?

935
01:06:53,848 --> 01:06:57,011
Huma's autograph,
for Esteban.

936
01:06:57,084 --> 01:07:00,986
<i>Dear Esteban: This is
the autograph I never gave you...</i>

937
01:07:01,055 --> 01:07:03,615
<i>and not because
you didn't try.</i>

938
01:07:07,728 --> 01:07:10,094
<i>I have been foolish,
casting my pearls before swine.</i>

939
01:07:10,164 --> 01:07:13,031
<i>- You mean me?
- You and your friend, Mr. Mitchell.</i>

940
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:16,126
<i>He came to see me
and repeated the slander you'd told him.</i>

941
01:07:16,203 --> 01:07:18,899
<i>- So I threw him out.
- You threw Mitch out?</i>

942
01:07:19,740 --> 01:07:23,176
He returned with a box of roses
to beg my forgiveness.

943
01:07:23,244 --> 01:07:27,010
"Forgive me," he said,
but some things are not forgivable.

944
01:07:27,081 --> 01:07:29,675
Cruelty is not forgivable.

945
01:07:29,750 --> 01:07:32,048
It is the one unforgivable thing.

946
01:07:33,387 --> 01:07:35,150
Well?

947
01:07:36,157 --> 01:07:38,921
- Are you learning the part too?
- Of course not.

948
01:07:38,993 --> 01:07:42,087
- You should, just in case.
- You think so?

949
01:07:43,097 --> 01:07:44,496
May I have some privacy?

950
01:07:44,565 --> 01:07:48,126
So you can get your fix?
Can't wait till the end?

951
01:07:48,202 --> 01:07:49,999
If you know, why ask?

952
01:07:51,472 --> 01:07:54,805
If you don't want me to tell Huma,
do it in the bathroom.

953
01:07:54,875 --> 01:07:56,638
I don't need to see these things.

954
01:07:57,178 --> 01:07:58,406
All right.

955
01:07:58,479 --> 01:08:00,743
Keep an eye on the door.

956
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:10,047
I know that when you're young...
well, you're no child...

957
01:08:10,124 --> 01:08:11,955
you don't value these things.

958
01:08:12,026 --> 01:08:16,463
But you're cute,
nicely proportioned...

959
01:08:16,530 --> 01:08:18,521
kind of small, but cute.

960
01:08:18,599 --> 01:08:20,089
You've lost weight...

961
01:08:20,167 --> 01:08:22,135
well, it's all the drugs...

962
01:08:22,203 --> 01:08:24,933
but the important thing is
you've lost weight.

963
01:08:25,005 --> 01:08:26,768
You've got talent...

964
01:08:26,841 --> 01:08:29,002
limited talent,
but you've got it.

965
01:08:29,076 --> 01:08:31,544
And, above all,
a woman who loves you.

966
01:08:31,612 --> 01:08:33,512
And you trade it all for junk.

967
01:08:33,581 --> 01:08:36,106
You think it's worth it?
Well, it isn't.

968
01:08:36,183 --> 01:08:38,048
It isn't worth it.

969
01:08:39,253 --> 01:08:42,654
I trade it for a bit of peace.
Come on, help me.

970
01:08:50,231 --> 01:08:52,631
You're getting flat
as a board.

971
01:08:53,501 --> 01:08:55,799
Compared to you.

972
01:08:58,372 --> 01:09:00,567
What a dirty habit!

973
01:09:02,042 --> 01:09:04,135
Haven't you ever thought
of cutting it off?

974
01:09:04,211 --> 01:09:05,906
I'd get no work.

975
01:09:05,980 --> 01:09:08,346
The clients like us pneumatic
and well-hung.

976
01:09:08,415 --> 01:09:11,475
Rheumatic?
Guys are so odd.

977
01:09:11,552 --> 01:09:14,146
Not rheumatic. Pneumatic.

978
01:09:14,221 --> 01:09:16,655
A pair of tits as hard
as newly inflated tires...

979
01:09:16,724 --> 01:09:18,419
and a big dick as well.

980
01:09:19,894 --> 01:09:21,555
Show me your cock.

981
01:09:21,629 --> 01:09:24,097
That fix didn't agree with you.

982
01:09:24,164 --> 01:09:25,859
Maybe I'll like it too.

983
01:09:25,933 --> 01:09:29,130
You've got enough problems
as it is.

984
01:09:29,203 --> 01:09:32,764
Go, you're on now.
And don't throw up on anybody.

985
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:36,401
The audience loves it.
They think it's because I'm pregnant.

986
01:09:36,477 --> 01:09:39,537
You're not pregnant in this scene.
You've had a doll.

987
01:09:39,613 --> 01:09:41,513
That's right.

988
01:09:47,688 --> 01:09:50,156
Will you show me
your cock later?

989
01:09:50,224 --> 01:09:53,318
I'll show it to you
and you can lick it.

990
01:09:53,827 --> 01:09:55,761
Young people will try anything!

991
01:10:01,001 --> 01:10:05,938
MONTHS LATER

992
01:10:17,351 --> 01:10:19,478
I'm going to call him Esteban.

993
01:10:19,553 --> 01:10:21,953
Your son?

994
01:10:22,022 --> 01:10:23,853
Why?

995
01:10:23,924 --> 01:10:25,949
After yours.

996
01:10:26,794 --> 01:10:29,490
This baby will belong
to both of us.

997
01:10:30,364 --> 01:10:32,730
If only he did.

998
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:35,394
If only we were alone
in the world...

999
01:10:35,469 --> 01:10:37,767
without any commitments.

1000
01:10:39,506 --> 01:10:42,304
You and your son,
just for me.

1001
01:10:43,577 --> 01:10:45,738
But you have a family.

1002
01:10:47,348 --> 01:10:50,579
I'm going to fix your hair
and make you up a bit.

1003
01:10:50,651 --> 01:10:53,711
- Why?
- I like to see you look nice.

1004
01:10:53,787 --> 01:10:56,187
And I called your mother.

1005
01:10:56,256 --> 01:10:58,224
She's coming
to see you today.

1006
01:10:58,292 --> 01:10:59,725
My mother?

1007
01:10:59,793 --> 01:11:02,853
You have a mother.
Don't you remember?

1008
01:11:04,798 --> 01:11:06,766
What will I tell her?

1009
01:11:07,434 --> 01:11:10,096
That you love her...
I don't know.

1010
01:11:13,941 --> 01:11:15,932
Come in, Huma.

1011
01:11:16,610 --> 01:11:18,805
No, it isn't Huma.
May I come in?

1012
01:11:18,879 --> 01:11:20,870
Of course, Mario.
Come in.

1013
01:11:22,249 --> 01:11:24,877
- You're very early today.
- Yes.

1014
01:11:26,453 --> 01:11:29,718
- What are you doing?
- Just a bit of ironing.

1015
01:11:30,257 --> 01:11:32,157
Is anything wrong?

1016
01:11:32,226 --> 01:11:34,990
I didn't sleep very well
last night.

1017
01:11:35,062 --> 01:11:38,088
I've been on edge all day.

1018
01:11:38,165 --> 01:11:40,258
Would you give me
a blow job?

1019
01:11:41,568 --> 01:11:45,004
Can't you all get it into your heads
that I'm retired?

1020
01:11:45,072 --> 01:11:47,302
I don't want you to think that...

1021
01:11:47,374 --> 01:11:49,433
but since I've been
on edge all day...

1022
01:11:49,510 --> 01:11:51,944
I think a blow job
would relax me.

1023
01:11:52,012 --> 01:11:54,606
You give me one.
I'm on edge too.

1024
01:11:55,149 --> 01:11:58,380
Well, it would be the first time
I've sucked a woman's cock...

1025
01:11:58,452 --> 01:12:00,420
but if that's what it takes...

1026
01:12:00,487 --> 01:12:02,648
The whole company
is obsessed with my cock!

1027
01:12:02,723 --> 01:12:05,624
It isn't the only one around.
Don't you have a cock?

1028
01:12:05,693 --> 01:12:06,682
Yes.

1029
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:10,719
Do people ask you to suck their cocks
because you've got one?

1030
01:12:11,165 --> 01:12:12,154
- Do they?
- No.

1031
01:12:12,232 --> 01:12:13,859
Well, then?

1032
01:12:15,035 --> 01:12:17,833
Look, I'll suck you off
to show you how open-minded...

1033
01:12:17,905 --> 01:12:21,102
and how sensitive
I am about these things.

1034
01:12:21,175 --> 01:12:23,143
Where's the fucking phone?

1035
01:12:23,210 --> 01:12:24,199
Hello?

1036
01:12:33,487 --> 01:12:36,081
All right, don't worry.
I'll see to everything.

1037
01:12:38,892 --> 01:12:41,452
Shall we go to my room?
In case Huma comes...

1038
01:12:41,528 --> 01:12:44,691
Huma can't come.
She's in the hospital, along with Nina.

1039
01:12:44,765 --> 01:12:48,861
- What's happened?
- They nearly killed each other.

1040
01:12:48,936 --> 01:12:50,870
Fuck!

1041
01:12:53,674 --> 01:12:54,663
Here.

1042
01:12:54,742 --> 01:12:56,505
We'll have to cancel
the performance.

1043
01:12:56,577 --> 01:12:58,602
- Don't say anything.
- We have to say something.

1044
01:12:58,679 --> 01:13:00,670
Yes, but it doesn't have
to be the truth.

1045
01:13:00,748 --> 01:13:03,581
- I'll make something up.
- Right.

1046
01:13:04,585 --> 01:13:06,416
And...

1047
01:13:10,090 --> 01:13:12,285
- Hello, how are you?
- Hello.

1048
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:14,587
Come in.

1049
01:13:19,399 --> 01:13:22,835
- Where is she?
- There, in the bedroom.

1050
01:13:42,956 --> 01:13:46,756
And here I was so worried,
thinking you were in El Salvador.

1051
01:13:47,694 --> 01:13:49,924
I see you've learned to lie.

1052
01:13:49,997 --> 01:13:52,261
I didn't know
how to tell you.

1053
01:13:52,366 --> 01:13:54,357
What are you going to do now?

1054
01:13:54,434 --> 01:13:56,595
Leave the order?
Get married?

1055
01:13:56,670 --> 01:13:58,968
Mom, the things you ask!

1056
01:13:59,606 --> 01:14:01,938
One never knows with you.

1057
01:14:02,009 --> 01:14:04,307
At least, I don't.

1058
01:14:04,711 --> 01:14:07,874
Even this I had to learn about
through your friend.

1059
01:14:10,250 --> 01:14:13,219
What would I have done
without her?

1060
01:14:13,487 --> 01:14:14,647
How's Dad?

1061
01:14:14,721 --> 01:14:17,315
Same as ever.
I don't know.

1062
01:14:17,391 --> 01:14:19,291
Worse.

1063
01:14:20,327 --> 01:14:23,854
If you don't mind,
I'd rather not tell him anything.

1064
01:14:25,199 --> 01:14:28,430
He wouldn't get it anyway.

1065
01:14:29,570 --> 01:14:32,061
- And Sapic?
- Fine.

1066
01:14:37,411 --> 01:14:39,845
Rosa, I don't know
what to do.

1067
01:14:41,515 --> 01:14:43,312
What do you expect me
to do?

1068
01:14:45,152 --> 01:14:46,710
Nothing, Mom.

1069
01:14:48,422 --> 01:14:51,414
You don't expect
anything from me?

1070
01:14:52,826 --> 01:14:55,090
It isn't that.

1071
01:14:55,596 --> 01:14:58,895
What I mean is
don't make it harder for me.

1072
01:15:13,714 --> 01:15:15,614
Would you like anything?
I'm making tea.

1073
01:15:15,682 --> 01:15:17,115
No, thank you.

1074
01:15:17,184 --> 01:15:21,052
What exactly is wrong?
I didn't understand over the phone.

1075
01:15:21,121 --> 01:15:24,056
According to the ultrasound,
she's got placenta previa.

1076
01:15:24,124 --> 01:15:27,457
When the time comes,
she'll need a caesarian.

1077
01:15:27,527 --> 01:15:29,791
In the meantime,
she must have complete rest.

1078
01:15:29,863 --> 01:15:31,694
Do you think
I should take her home?

1079
01:15:31,765 --> 01:15:35,292
I have to look after her father
as if he were a child.

1080
01:15:35,369 --> 01:15:38,236
You're her mother...

1081
01:15:38,305 --> 01:15:40,967
but I think
Rosa's better-off here.

1082
01:15:41,041 --> 01:15:43,839
That's the impression
she gave me.

1083
01:15:43,911 --> 01:15:46,004
If you need money,
just ask me.

1084
01:15:46,079 --> 01:15:49,674
- And, please, keep me informed.
- Yes. Don't worry.

1085
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:51,149
Thank you very much.

1086
01:15:51,218 --> 01:15:53,049
- I'll see you out.
- No, really.

1087
01:15:57,157 --> 01:16:00,285
I don't know
what I did wrong with Rosa.

1088
01:16:00,994 --> 01:16:03,963
Ever since she was born,
she's been like an alien.

1089
01:16:04,531 --> 01:16:06,658
Do you have children?

1090
01:16:06,733 --> 01:16:08,496
Yes, one.

1091
01:16:08,568 --> 01:16:11,298
Do you get along well
with him?

1092
01:16:12,339 --> 01:16:14,773
He died.

1093
01:16:15,943 --> 01:16:18,241
I'm sorry.

1094
01:16:39,366 --> 01:16:41,732
Due to reasons
beyond their control...

1095
01:16:41,802 --> 01:16:45,829
two of the actresses
who triumph daily on this stage...

1096
01:16:45,906 --> 01:16:49,171
cannot be here tonight...
the poor things.

1097
01:16:49,242 --> 01:16:51,938
So the show
has been cancelled.

1098
01:16:52,713 --> 01:16:55,443
Those who wish
can get their money back...

1099
01:16:55,515 --> 01:16:58,040
but for those who have
nothing better to do...

1100
01:16:58,151 --> 01:17:01,177
it's a shame to waste the rare occasion
that you make it to the theater.

1101
01:17:01,688 --> 01:17:03,087
If you stay...

1102
01:17:03,156 --> 01:17:06,648
I promise to entertain you
with my life story.

1103
01:17:08,762 --> 01:17:10,957
Good-bye. I'm very sorry.

1104
01:17:11,098 --> 01:17:14,761
If I bore you, you can pretend
to snore... like this.

1105
01:17:15,335 --> 01:17:18,862
I'll get the idea, and you certainly
won't hurt my feelings.

1106
01:17:18,939 --> 01:17:20,668
Honestly.

1107
01:17:22,809 --> 01:17:24,538
They call me "La Agrado"...

1108
01:17:24,611 --> 01:17:28,638
because I've always tried
to make people's lives agreeable.

1109
01:17:30,417 --> 01:17:34,376
As well as being agreeable,
I'm very authentic!

1110
01:17:34,988 --> 01:17:36,649
Look at this body!

1111
01:17:38,125 --> 01:17:40,184
All made to measure.

1112
01:17:40,894 --> 01:17:44,091
Almond-shaped eyes... 80,000.

1113
01:17:45,432 --> 01:17:47,195
Nose... 200,000.

1114
01:17:47,267 --> 01:17:50,828
A waste of money. Another beating
the following year left it like this.

1115
01:17:50,904 --> 01:17:53,600
It gives me character,
but if I'd known...

1116
01:17:53,673 --> 01:17:55,641
I wouldn't have touched it.

1117
01:17:55,709 --> 01:17:56,835
I'll continue.

1118
01:17:56,910 --> 01:18:00,471
Tits... two,
because I'm no monster.

1119
01:18:00,547 --> 01:18:04,847
70,000 each,
but I've more than earned that back.

1120
01:18:04,918 --> 01:18:06,112
Silicone in...

1121
01:18:06,186 --> 01:18:07,414
Where?

1122
01:18:07,487 --> 01:18:09,853
Lips, forehead, cheeks...

1123
01:18:09,923 --> 01:18:11,413
hips and ass.

1124
01:18:11,491 --> 01:18:13,152
A pint costs about 100,000...

1125
01:18:13,226 --> 01:18:15,888
so you work it out,
because I've lost count.

1126
01:18:15,962 --> 01:18:18,089
Jaw reduction... 75,000.

1127
01:18:18,165 --> 01:18:19,757
Complete laser depilation...

1128
01:18:19,833 --> 01:18:22,324
because women, like men,
also come from apes.

1129
01:18:22,402 --> 01:18:24,063
60,000 a session.

1130
01:18:24,137 --> 01:18:28,369
It depends how hairy you are.
Usually, two to four sessions.

1131
01:18:28,442 --> 01:18:32,469
But if you're a flamenco diva,
you'll need more.

1132
01:18:35,982 --> 01:18:37,745
Well, as I was saying...

1133
01:18:37,818 --> 01:18:40,184
it costs a lot
to be authentic, ma'am.

1134
01:18:40,253 --> 01:18:42,380
And one can't be stingy
with these things...

1135
01:18:42,456 --> 01:18:44,890
because you are more authentic...

1136
01:18:44,958 --> 01:18:48,325
the more you resemble
what you've dreamed of being.

1137
01:19:00,574 --> 01:19:02,405
I'll turn you around.

1138
01:19:02,476 --> 01:19:04,876
- Please, be careful.
- Don't worry.

1139
01:19:05,345 --> 01:19:08,314
We'll lift up a bit.
That's it.

1140
01:19:09,583 --> 01:19:11,517
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

1141
01:19:11,585 --> 01:19:13,485
If you can push it over here...

1142
01:19:14,754 --> 01:19:16,813
- I'll put this away.
- Thank you.

1143
01:19:16,890 --> 01:19:19,188
- Can you manage?
- Yes.

1144
01:19:24,798 --> 01:19:26,857
To the Hospital del Mar,
please.

1145
01:19:27,667 --> 01:19:30,329
Can we go
through Medinaceli Square?

1146
01:19:30,403 --> 01:19:33,566
Aren't we meeting your mother
at the hospital?

1147
01:19:34,441 --> 01:19:37,535
- I just want to see the square.
- All right.

1148
01:19:45,218 --> 01:19:46,947
Stop here!

1149
01:19:48,688 --> 01:19:51,282
I played here as a child.

1150
01:19:57,631 --> 01:19:59,064
Sapic!

1151
01:20:11,611 --> 01:20:14,603
Come here, boy!

1152
01:20:18,018 --> 01:20:20,179
Hello, Sapic.

1153
01:20:21,855 --> 01:20:24,585
That dog would go
with anybody.

1154
01:20:25,225 --> 01:20:27,022
Do you have a dog?

1155
01:20:27,594 --> 01:20:30,188
No, but I really like them.

1156
01:20:30,263 --> 01:20:33,699
- How old are you?
- Twenty-six.

1157
01:20:35,168 --> 01:20:39,366
- And how tall are you?
- Not very. Five six.

1158
01:20:44,110 --> 01:20:45,202
Come on.

1159
01:20:45,278 --> 01:20:47,212
Go on.
Go back to Dad.

1160
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:48,304
Come on.

1161
01:20:49,216 --> 01:20:51,241
Good-bye, Dad.

1162
01:20:58,291 --> 01:21:00,725
- You aren't in any pain?
- No.

1163
01:21:01,895 --> 01:21:04,625
That's great.
Painless childbirth.

1164
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:08,893
When is she going
into surgery?

1165
01:21:09,436 --> 01:21:11,233
In an hour and a half.

1166
01:21:13,206 --> 01:21:17,267
I've got time to go check
on your father and come back.

1167
01:21:17,510 --> 01:21:20,070
You don't have
to come back, Mom.

1168
01:21:20,380 --> 01:21:22,905
I want to be here
with you.

1169
01:21:25,585 --> 01:21:27,382
Give Dad a kiss for me.

1170
01:21:27,454 --> 01:21:30,150
I'm keeping this one.

1171
01:21:39,332 --> 01:21:40,594
So long.

1172
01:21:40,667 --> 01:21:42,259
Good-bye.

1173
01:21:45,905 --> 01:21:49,136
I hope the third Esteban
is the definitive one for you.

1174
01:21:49,209 --> 01:21:51,473
The third Esteban?

1175
01:21:51,544 --> 01:21:53,739
Lola was the first...

1176
01:21:53,813 --> 01:21:55,440
and your son, the second.

1177
01:21:55,515 --> 01:21:58,507
So you knew Lola
was the father of my son too.

1178
01:21:58,585 --> 01:22:00,450
Of course.

1179
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:02,818
It didn't take a genius.

1180
01:22:02,889 --> 01:22:05,255
Lola doesn't know
we had a son.

1181
01:22:05,325 --> 01:22:07,555
I never told him.

1182
01:22:08,194 --> 01:22:10,719
Did your son know?

1183
01:22:10,797 --> 01:22:12,992
No, he didn't.

1184
01:22:14,768 --> 01:22:17,862
Let's not talk about sad things.
This is a great day.

1185
01:22:17,937 --> 01:22:21,668
They've put Videla in jail,
and your son's going to be born.

1186
01:22:24,477 --> 01:22:27,071
- Promise me one thing.
- What?

1187
01:22:28,248 --> 01:22:31,513
- If anything happens...
- What could happen?

1188
01:22:31,584 --> 01:22:33,575
Promise you won't hide anything
from the child.

1189
01:22:33,653 --> 01:22:37,714
I don't have to. You can tell him
whatever you want yourself.

1190
01:22:37,791 --> 01:22:40,282
Promise me.

1191
01:22:40,660 --> 01:22:43,026
If it makes you happier.

1192
01:22:45,031 --> 01:22:46,589
All right.

1193
01:22:46,666 --> 01:22:49,134
I promise.

1194
01:23:06,786 --> 01:23:11,155
We are here today
to say good-bye to our sister Rosa.

1195
01:23:42,722 --> 01:23:45,520
Manuela, I'm so happy
to see you.

1196
01:23:45,592 --> 01:23:47,355
What a pity
it has to be here.

1197
01:23:48,061 --> 01:23:49,688
It couldn't be
anywhere else.

1198
01:23:51,197 --> 01:23:54,894
You aren't a human being, Lola.
You're an epidemic!

1199
01:23:56,035 --> 01:23:58,595
I was always excessive.

1200
01:23:58,671 --> 01:24:01,071
And I'm very tired.

1201
01:24:01,641 --> 01:24:03,370
Manuela, I'm dying.

1202
01:24:05,445 --> 01:24:06,434
Come.

1203
01:24:09,649 --> 01:24:11,583
I'm saying good-bye
to everything.

1204
01:24:11,651 --> 01:24:15,143
I robbed Agrado
to pay my ticket to Argentina.

1205
01:24:15,822 --> 01:24:18,950
I wanted to take a last look
at the town...

1206
01:24:19,025 --> 01:24:20,583
the river...

1207
01:24:20,660 --> 01:24:21,991
our street.

1208
01:24:23,530 --> 01:24:26,829
And I'm happy
I can say good-bye to you too.

1209
01:24:28,067 --> 01:24:31,628
Now I just have to see
Sister Rosa's child.

1210
01:24:32,372 --> 01:24:34,567
My son.

1211
01:24:36,576 --> 01:24:39,977
I always dreamed of having a son.
You know that.

1212
01:24:40,747 --> 01:24:43,181
When I left Barcelona,
I was carrying your child.

1213
01:24:43,783 --> 01:24:44,772
What?

1214
01:24:46,586 --> 01:24:48,076
You mean you too--

1215
01:24:49,656 --> 01:24:51,647
Did you have it?

1216
01:24:52,325 --> 01:24:54,020
A beautiful boy.

1217
01:24:54,093 --> 01:24:56,789
I want to see him.
Did you bring him with you?

1218
01:24:56,863 --> 01:24:59,331
He's in Madrid,
but you can't see him.

1219
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:03,533
Even from a distance.
I promise he won't see me.

1220
01:25:05,205 --> 01:25:07,139
It's the last thing
I ask of you.

1221
01:25:07,941 --> 01:25:10,171
You can't see him.

1222
01:25:10,877 --> 01:25:12,777
Please!

1223
01:25:17,183 --> 01:25:20,949
Six months ago,
he was run over by a car.

1224
01:25:22,989 --> 01:25:24,479
He's dead.

1225
01:25:34,667 --> 01:25:38,330
I only came to Barcelona
to tell you.

1226
01:25:38,404 --> 01:25:40,497
I'm sorry.

1227
01:26:07,934 --> 01:26:09,731
The baby!

1228
01:26:10,303 --> 01:26:12,328
Where have you been?

1229
01:26:12,405 --> 01:26:14,202
Haven't you taken
Sapic out yet?

1230
01:26:14,274 --> 01:26:17,437
- You weren't here.
- I'm here now.

1231
01:26:22,582 --> 01:26:23,913
He's hungry.

1232
01:26:23,983 --> 01:26:27,180
- The bottle's heating.
- Will you get it, please?

1233
01:26:27,253 --> 01:26:28,777
Come here.

1234
01:26:29,422 --> 01:26:32,016
Vicenta, don't let my husband
come in here, please.

1235
01:26:32,091 --> 01:26:34,389
He's convinced
the baby's yours.

1236
01:26:34,460 --> 01:26:36,428
Yes, I know.

1237
01:26:37,997 --> 01:26:40,056
He's very jealous.

1238
01:26:40,133 --> 01:26:42,294
I told him
the baby was yours.

1239
01:26:42,368 --> 01:26:44,097
I don't dare
tell him the truth.

1240
01:26:44,170 --> 01:26:46,434
He wouldn't understand
anyway.

1241
01:26:46,673 --> 01:26:48,937
If only he were mine.

1242
01:26:51,377 --> 01:26:52,844
What is it?

1243
01:26:52,912 --> 01:26:54,607
Who's that woman?

1244
01:26:54,681 --> 01:26:56,979
It's Manuela,
the new cook.

1245
01:26:57,050 --> 01:26:59,644
She's been with us
four days.

1246
01:26:59,719 --> 01:27:03,120
We've fixed up this room
so she can be here with her child.

1247
01:27:03,189 --> 01:27:05,316
Remember?
I told you.

1248
01:27:06,125 --> 01:27:08,787
- How old are you?
- Thirty-eight.

1249
01:27:09,429 --> 01:27:12,364
- How tall are you?
- Five seven.

1250
01:27:13,566 --> 01:27:14,828
All right.

1251
01:27:14,901 --> 01:27:17,267
Now you can go
for a walk.

1252
01:27:19,706 --> 01:27:21,674
Go on.

1253
01:27:22,208 --> 01:27:23,470
There you are.

1254
01:27:23,810 --> 01:27:26,506
- The bottle, ma'am.
- Thank you.

1255
01:27:28,448 --> 01:27:30,109
Thank you.

1256
01:27:30,450 --> 01:27:32,418
No, no.
We're going to eat now.

1257
01:27:36,789 --> 01:27:37,915
Yes?

1258
01:27:37,991 --> 01:27:40,289
Don't tell anyone
about the antibodies.

1259
01:27:45,398 --> 01:27:47,127
Do the nuns know?

1260
01:27:49,802 --> 01:27:51,667
All right.

1261
01:28:00,013 --> 01:28:03,915
ONE MONTH LATER

1262
01:28:25,805 --> 01:28:27,602
Hello, Lola.

1263
01:28:29,942 --> 01:28:31,739
Take him.

1264
01:28:41,187 --> 01:28:43,018
What did the doctor say?

1265
01:28:43,089 --> 01:28:45,717
He's fine.
You can see... he's normal.

1266
01:28:48,961 --> 01:28:51,122
You're with Dad.

1267
01:28:52,098 --> 01:28:55,090
- Can I give him a kiss?
- Of course.

1268
01:29:00,306 --> 01:29:03,867
My son, I'm sorry to leave you
such an awful inheritance.

1269
01:29:03,943 --> 01:29:05,376
Don't say that.

1270
01:29:05,445 --> 01:29:09,176
There's no reason why
he should develop the disease.

1271
01:29:22,762 --> 01:29:24,423
This is our Esteban.

1272
01:29:27,934 --> 01:29:29,799
You called him Esteban too?

1273
01:29:34,073 --> 01:29:35,802
Thank you.

1274
01:29:41,247 --> 01:29:43,477
He wanted to be a writer.

1275
01:29:43,750 --> 01:29:48,585
This is his notebook.
He took it with him everywhere.

1276
01:29:48,654 --> 01:29:51,555
He wrote this
the morning of the day he died.

1277
01:29:53,459 --> 01:29:55,518
Read it.

1278
01:29:56,028 --> 01:29:58,292
"Last night
Mom showed me a picture.

1279
01:29:59,465 --> 01:30:01,592
Half of it was missing.

1280
01:30:02,502 --> 01:30:06,802
I didn't want to tell her,
but my life is missing that same half."

1281
01:30:09,709 --> 01:30:11,506
Keep reading.

1282
01:30:16,115 --> 01:30:18,015
"This morning
I looked through her drawers...

1283
01:30:18,084 --> 01:30:21,076
and found
a bundle of pictures.

1284
01:30:21,854 --> 01:30:24,220
They were all missing
a half.

1285
01:30:25,057 --> 01:30:26,786
My father, I suppose.

1286
01:30:29,896 --> 01:30:32,490
I want to meet him.

1287
01:30:32,565 --> 01:30:35,932
I have to make Mom understand
that I don't care who he is...

1288
01:30:36,002 --> 01:30:37,663
or what he's like...

1289
01:30:37,737 --> 01:30:40,001
or how he behaved towards her.

1290
01:30:41,407 --> 01:30:44,240
She can't deny me
that right."

1291
01:30:49,816 --> 01:30:51,477
Keep the picture.

1292
01:30:55,221 --> 01:30:57,416
Thank you.

1293
01:31:12,839 --> 01:31:14,739
I don't like just anyone
kissing the baby.

1294
01:31:14,807 --> 01:31:17,207
Who was that woman
in the bar with you?

1295
01:31:17,276 --> 01:31:19,904
That woman is his father.

1296
01:31:19,979 --> 01:31:21,708
What did you say?

1297
01:31:21,781 --> 01:31:24,716
That was his father,
and he's very ill.

1298
01:31:25,117 --> 01:31:28,575
That monster is the one
who killed my daughter?

1299
01:31:30,590 --> 01:31:33,115
Don't think about that,
Rosa.

1300
01:31:44,570 --> 01:31:48,165
There are people who think
children are made in a day.

1301
01:31:48,875 --> 01:31:52,538
But it takes a long time...
a very long time.

1302
01:31:53,512 --> 01:31:57,972
That's why it's so awful to see
your child's blood on the ground.

1303
01:31:59,252 --> 01:32:03,746
A stream that flows for a minute
and yet costs us years.

1304
01:32:09,595 --> 01:32:12,029
When I found my son...

1305
01:32:12,498 --> 01:32:15,592
he was lying
in the middle of the street.

1306
01:32:25,945 --> 01:32:29,608
I soaked my hands in his blood
and licked them.

1307
01:32:30,516 --> 01:32:33,007
Because it was mine.

1308
01:32:35,521 --> 01:32:38,615
Animals lick their young,
don't they?

1309
01:32:40,159 --> 01:32:43,322
I'm not disgusted
by my son.

1310
01:32:44,730 --> 01:32:47,722
You don't know
what it's like.

1311
01:32:49,936 --> 01:32:52,928
In a monstrance
of glass and topaz...

1312
01:32:54,340 --> 01:32:58,106
I would put
the earth soaked by his blood.

1313
01:33:05,017 --> 01:33:06,951
Keep kneading.

1314
01:33:07,019 --> 01:33:09,544
The sadness should go
into your hands.

1315
01:33:09,789 --> 01:33:12,917
Work. You have to work.

1316
01:33:14,026 --> 01:33:16,961
- You don't notice my cold?
- No, it's fine.

1317
01:33:17,396 --> 01:33:19,728
Come on.
You shouldn't be in here.

1318
01:33:21,968 --> 01:33:23,162
Hello.

1319
01:33:23,235 --> 01:33:25,226
I've got a bouquet
for Agrado and Huma Rojo.

1320
01:33:25,304 --> 01:33:27,966
- Really?
- Yes. Sign here, please.

1321
01:33:28,040 --> 01:33:30,804
- You sure it's for Agrado?
- Yes, it says so.

1322
01:33:32,945 --> 01:33:33,934
Here.

1323
01:33:34,013 --> 01:33:36,208
Know why they call me
Agrado?

1324
01:33:37,016 --> 01:33:40,213
I've always tried
to make life agreeable for others.

1325
01:33:40,286 --> 01:33:41,981
Right.

1326
01:33:47,226 --> 01:33:48,750
"Dear Agrado and Huma:

1327
01:33:48,828 --> 01:33:51,058
Running away once again
with no good-byes...

1328
01:33:51,130 --> 01:33:53,530
though I know how much
you like them, Agrado."

1329
01:33:53,599 --> 01:33:56,864
<i>The situation with Rosa's parents
is unbearable.</i>

1330
01:33:56,936 --> 01:33:59,837
<i>The grandmother is afraid
a scratch will infect her.</i>

1331
01:33:59,905 --> 01:34:03,466
<i>I'm taking Esteban where he won't be
surrounded by hostility.</i>

1332
01:34:04,210 --> 01:34:07,008
<i>Agrado, you know
how much I love you.</i>

1333
01:34:07,713 --> 01:34:10,011
<i>Take good care
of yourself and of Huma.</i>

1334
01:34:10,082 --> 01:34:12,016
<i>I'm sorry to miss
the opening...</i>

1335
01:34:12,084 --> 01:34:15,178
<i>but I'm sure the homage to Lorca
will be a great success.</i>

1336
01:34:15,254 --> 01:34:16,619
<i>I'll write to you...</i>

1337
01:34:16,689 --> 01:34:19,681
<i>but it's better
you don't know any more.</i>

1338
01:34:19,759 --> 01:34:21,989
<i>Oh, and tear up the letter.</i>

1339
01:34:22,061 --> 01:34:23,722
<i>Your Manuela."</i>

1340
01:34:23,796 --> 01:34:28,733
TWO YEARS LATER

1341
01:34:29,969 --> 01:34:33,598
<i>I'm coming back to Barcelona
after two years...</i>

1342
01:34:33,672 --> 01:34:35,469
<i>but this time
I'm not running away.</i>

1343
01:34:35,541 --> 01:34:39,500
<i>I'm going to an AIDS conference
organized by Can Ruti.</i>

1344
01:34:39,578 --> 01:34:43,514
<i>My Esteban has neutralized
the virus in record time...</i>

1345
01:34:43,582 --> 01:34:45,482
<i>and they want to study
his case.</i>

1346
01:34:45,551 --> 01:34:47,348
<i>I'm so happy.</i>

1347
01:34:49,722 --> 01:34:51,713
May I?

1348
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:57,292
Hey, she's mine too!

1349
01:34:58,964 --> 01:35:01,694
You look beautiful!
Your hair's gotten so long.

1350
01:35:01,767 --> 01:35:04,861
- And so has yours.
- No, this is a wig for the play.

1351
01:35:04,937 --> 01:35:07,462
Wait, your earring's loose.
I'll fix it.

1352
01:35:07,540 --> 01:35:08,837
Learn, you animal!

1353
01:35:08,908 --> 01:35:11,741
An animal, but who
takes care of you like I do?

1354
01:35:11,811 --> 01:35:13,938
It's great about your son!

1355
01:35:14,013 --> 01:35:16,641
So he's neutralized the virus
practically overnight.

1356
01:35:16,715 --> 01:35:20,151
Yes. Esteban's case
proves the virus can disappear.

1357
01:35:20,219 --> 01:35:24,019
They're still trying to find out why,
but it's a miracle.

1358
01:35:24,090 --> 01:35:27,321
I knew it.
How I prayed for that child.

1359
01:35:27,660 --> 01:35:30,390
Why not stay with us
while you're in Barcelona?

1360
01:35:30,463 --> 01:35:31,452
Of course.

1361
01:35:31,530 --> 01:35:33,361
We're staying
with his grandparents.

1362
01:35:33,432 --> 01:35:35,457
Rosa's mother
is looking forward to it.

1363
01:35:35,534 --> 01:35:37,764
She's changed so much.

1364
01:35:37,837 --> 01:35:40,101
- Third call, five minutes.
- I have to go.

1365
01:35:43,742 --> 01:35:45,539
You've got Esteban's picture.

1366
01:35:45,611 --> 01:35:47,977
Lola gave it to me
before she died.

1367
01:35:48,047 --> 01:35:50,948
I was keeping it
until you came back.

1368
01:35:51,016 --> 01:35:52,608
Keep it.

1369
01:35:53,552 --> 01:35:55,315
Thank you.

1370
01:35:57,990 --> 01:35:59,651
And Nina?

1371
01:36:00,459 --> 01:36:02,427
I have to go.

1372
01:36:03,729 --> 01:36:06,527
Nina got married.
She's back in her home town.

1373
01:36:06,599 --> 01:36:09,261
She's got a baby too.
It's fat and horrible.

1374
01:36:09,335 --> 01:36:11,701
Really, really ugly.

1375
01:36:15,174 --> 01:36:17,108
I'll see you later.

1376
01:36:20,613 --> 01:36:22,547
"To Bette Davis,
Gena Rowlands, Romy Schneider...

1377
01:36:22,615 --> 01:36:24,480
To all actresses
who have played actresses...

1378
01:36:24,550 --> 01:36:26,211
to all women who act...

1379
01:36:26,285 --> 01:36:28,253
to men who act
and become women...

1380
01:36:28,320 --> 01:36:30,151
to all the people
who want to be mothers.

1381
01:36:30,222 --> 01:36:31,883
To my mother."

1382
01:36:32,558 --> 01:36:35,322
IN ORDER OF APPEARANCE
