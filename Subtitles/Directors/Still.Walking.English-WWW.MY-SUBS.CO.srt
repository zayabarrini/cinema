Radishes are genius.

2
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,396
How about potatoes?

3
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:07,441
With potatoes
it's up to the cook.

4
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:10,652
Radishes you can simmer or grill.

5
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:12,780
They're even delicious raw.

6
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:15,240
You don't grill radishes.

7
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,326
Sure you do.

8
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:21,914
If you simmer and then grill them,
they Iose their tartness.

9
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:26,376
Then you mix them with carrots
and saute with sesame oil.

10
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:28,378
Sesame oil, right.

11
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:31,090
Better write it down.
You'll forget.

12
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:33,425
No need.
l'll never cook it.

13
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:37,638
My husband grew up on fast food.
He'll eat anything.

14
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:39,598
Then why'd you ask?

15
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:41,683
l thought you might
want to talk, Mom.

16
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,771
ln that case, move your hands,
not your mouth.

17
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:47,856
lt's nearly lunchtime.

18
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:54,863
Can you go buy
some low-fat milk at the store?

19
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,783
Daddy?

20
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:01,537
Ouch.
Ηe can at least buy milk.

21
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:06,291
Ηe doesn't want the neighbors
to see him with a shopping bag.

22
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,292
What?

23
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,462
Even at his age,
he wants to be called "Doctor."

24
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:13,132
l can't believe it.

25
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:17,136
You spoil him too much, Mom.

Good morning.

28
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:37,156
Don't you wish the weather
would cool down, Doctor?

29
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:41,660
lt's supposed to be
another scorcher today.

30
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:45,581
When it's this hot,
l can hardly stand to drink water.

31
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,876
Cold noodles are all l can eat.

32
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,627
That's not good.

33
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:54,173
You should eat some eel
for your health.

34
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:59,178
l have a feeling my time
could be up any day now.

35
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:04,308
When it is, l want you
to be there for my death.

36
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:07,603
ln that case,
l've got to outlive you.

37
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:09,813
See you.

38
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,191

Let's take the last train home.

49
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,167
lf we leave at 8:00 p.m.,
we can make it.

50
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:24,257
l told them we'd spend the night.
Brought a change of clothes too.

51
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:28,553
Can't you make up
an emergency PTA meeting?

52
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,224
No?

53
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:35,727
You're always blaming
someone else.

54
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:38,563
There's nothing
to talk about with them.

55
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:42,442
Dad still thinks
l'm a huge baseball fan.

56
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:45,904
You like baseball, Ryo?

57
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,949
l used to, long, long ago.

58
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,285
l want you to know,

59
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:57,416
l'm the one who's really nervous,
though l doubt you notice.

60
00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:00,627
l know, l know.

61
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:09,010
They say he even moved
near the racetrack.

62
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:12,097
lt's a sickness, then.

63
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,266
As they get older,

64
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:18,103
their bodies can't keep up
with women and drink,

65
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:20,605
but not so with gambling.

66
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:22,983
It's the worst vice.

67
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,277
How awfuI.

68
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:34,077
You still have sparrows out here.

69
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:38,540
They show up because
your father feeds them rice.

70
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:41,334
We only have crows.

71
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:45,839
On garbage pickup days,
they're waiting like this.

72
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,549
Peel off all the skin.

73
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,551
Oh, there's some left.

74
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:53,972
You're such a pretty girl.
Show off your forehead.

75
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:58,477
When's Ryo coming?

76
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:01,480
On the phone he said by noon.

77
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:05,484
ls the "Unsmiling Prince"
coming too?

78
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:09,321
- Yes, they're spending the night.
- What a surprise.

79
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,159
But you know...

80
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:17,829
he didn't have to go
for a used model.

81
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,998
That sounds so cruel.

82
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:21,458
Besides...

83
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:26,296
it's better to marry
a divorcee than a widow.

84
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:31,343
At least a divorcee
chose to leave her husband.

85
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:34,804
You sound so scary
sometimes, Mom.

86
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,973
l'm just stating the obvious.

87
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:40,435
lt's because you pushed him
so hard to get married.

88
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:43,313
Maybe, but he could have
had his pick.

89
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:47,234
Ryo wasn't as popular
as his older brother.

90
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,611
That's not true.

91
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:53,406
At his graduation,
all his buttons were torn off.

92
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,200
Ηe probably got beat up.

93
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,369
That's not true.

94
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,455
All his lower classmates
wanted them.

95
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:04,459
He said there was
a long line of girls.

96
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:08,755
Parental pride can be blinding.
Better watch out myself.

97
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,301
lt's only been three years...

98
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:16,346
since her first one died.

99
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,723
lsn't it four years?

100
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:22,686
- ln any case, it's too soon.
- You think?

101
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,396
She's just cold.

102
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:26,022
l'm not so sure.

103
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:27,607
l am.

104
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:30,569
You've never worked
outside the house, Mom.

105
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:34,823
You don't know how hard it is
to be a single mom.

106
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:39,578
There you go, making fun
of me for "not working."

107
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,955
l'm not making fun of you.

108
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,792
Besides, after we put you
through college,

109
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:49,254
you only worked three years.

110
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,924
Four. lt was four years.

111
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,646
Please bring it up
with your sister.

112
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,650
About moving.

113
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:17,949
Shouldn't you discuss things with her?
Like about your father.

114
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:20,702
l'm sure she's got it figured out.

115
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:24,080
l'm not planning on moving back.

116
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:27,626
Although it'd be great
if they looked after them.

117
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:32,464
That's not likely.
You're the eldest son.

118
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:35,467
Second-eldest.

119
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,057
What's that?

120
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:44,267
Cola and ginger ale.

121
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:46,269
Drink them separately.

122
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:50,398
They have free refills.
Don't act so poor.

123
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:05,497
Say...

124
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,333
how's school?

125
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,585
Normal.

126
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,713
Normal?

127
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,298
Yeah.

128
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,593
Listen...

129
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:24,015
your mother told me yesterday
about the rabbit.

130
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,144
Why did you laugh when it died?

131
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:31,064
- lt was funny.
- What was?

132
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:36,903
Rena started saying we should
write letters to the rabbit.

133
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,615
What's wrong with writing letters?

134
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:43,076
Letters no one will read?

135
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,827
Your ice tea is
so delicious, Grandma.

136
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:28,329
They're just supermarket teabags.

137
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:31,624
l used to steep my own, but -

138
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,919
l see.
lt must be the water, then.

139
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,796
lt's just tap water.

140
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:39,090
You'll drink anything.

141
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:42,469
As long as you like it,
it doesn't matter.

142
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:43,928
Right?

143
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,097
What did you eat last night?

144
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:47,891
- Sushi!
- Ηey!

145
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,727
l told you we're having
sushi for lunch.

146
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,854
Just the sushi that goes around.

147
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,981
Thirty-six plates!

148
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,441
A new record!

149
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:59,194
Some record.

150
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:01,154
The pudding went around too.

151
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,532
There's pudding
that goes around?

152
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:05,825
Melon too!

153
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:10,622
l ordered some sushi just in case,
but if you just had that yesterday -

154
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,624
lt's fine. l haven't had any.

155
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,627
- We can eat sushi every day.
- Every day.

156
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:20,131
Ever since the son took over
at Matsu Sushi, the fish isn't as good.

157
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,801
- ls that so?
- All done.

158
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:27,263
But they wrap their sea urchin
in cucumber, not seaweed.

159
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:28,807
l like that.

160
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:32,268
Does sea urchin come with sushi deluxe?
That's what l ordered.

161
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:34,145
Maybe l'll call them.

162
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,898
Oh, don't bother.

163
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:40,693
Only one.
Don't spoil your appetite.

164
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,905
Oh, let them.
That's what l bought them for.

165
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:45,490
You're lucky

166
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,451
you don't get scolded
at Grandma's house.

167
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:51,996
- l love Grandma's house!
- Too bad.

168
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:55,792
Without the "house"
you would've gotten another one.

169
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:58,336
- Red bean too.
- That's for Grandma.

170
00:13:58,462 --> 00:13:59,629
Oh, sorry.

171
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:02,048
You don't like red bean, do you?

172
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:17,438
Couldn't you stop
calling him Ryo?

173
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:23,903
lf only for today.
To help your mother out.

174
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:26,030
But Ryo is just Ryo.

175
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,784
You know better.

176
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,036
You do it on purpose.

177
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,291
Tonami doesn't answer.

178
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:39,669
Publishers are probably
closed on Saturdays.

179
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,547
Call him back Monday.

180
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:47,510
Don't say anything to them
about my job.

181
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,180
Please.

182
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:54,809
lf we make it through today,
we won't see them for a while.

183
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:59,147
They're your parents.
Don't be so defensive.

184
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,982
That's exactly why.

185
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:05,028
l refuse to say l'm between jobs.
Not to him.

186
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,738
Oh no.

187
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:11,409
You get so defensive
about your father.

188
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:18,082
Come on, carry one.

189
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:26,174
HeIIo.

190
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,426
That's "l'm home," right?

191
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:29,761
Nice to see you.

192
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,013
Welcome. lsn't it hot?

193
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,348
Ηello.

194
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:35,433
What good manners you have.

195
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:36,935
You left this behind.

196
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:41,064
l'm so sorry. Ηe's always leaving
something behind. Thanks.

197
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,776
The station area's changed.
l got lost, drenched in sweat.

198
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,445
You're Rip Van Winkle,
because you never visit.

199
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:49,948
That narrow bookstore's gone.

200
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:53,159
The owner got sick
and was hospitalized.

201
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:56,412
There was no one left
to look after the store.

202
00:15:57,081 --> 00:16:01,542
We'll chill this
in the bathtub, and -

203
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:04,045
You said you liked
cream puffs, Mother.

204
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:06,381
Thank you so much.

205
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:09,217
The first one goes on his altar.

206
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:12,720
Your flower arrangement's beautiful.
Which school, Mother?

207
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,931
Oh, l'm self-taught.

208
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,975
Mom just fakes it.

209
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:20,478
When l took lessons,
it was completely different.

210
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:24,148
As long as they're pretty,
it doesn't matter.

211
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:38,997
Been a while.

212
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,790
Ηello.

213
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,502
You have a nice tan.
Hawaii?

214
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:49,340
No time to go anywhere.
l make do at the local park.

215
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:52,802
Ηe walks around in his swimsuit.
Can you believe it?

216
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:55,013
You've grown more, Satsuki.

217
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,348
Another half inch
over the summer.

218
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:59,225
You'll outgrow me soon.

219
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,394
You eat enough.

220
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,522
Mutsu, are you still fencing?

221
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,523
What?

222
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,735
Ηe quit after we bought him
all the equipment.

223
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:12,280
lt's too hot, and it stinks.

224
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,452
Oh, here's Grandpa.

225
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,497
lt's nice to see you again.

226
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,375
Oh, you're here.

227
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:25,877
Ηello.

228
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:31,049
Ηe knew.

229
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:34,093
l'm so sorry.
Ηe's so unfriendly.

230
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:37,138
Don't worry.
My father's just like him.

231
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:41,142
When Junpei
first brought his wife here,

232
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:44,562
he ran and hid
in his examination room.

233
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:55,156
I'm sorry.
Can you sleep okay?

234
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:57,033
I wake up sometimes.

235
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,451
Poor thing.

236
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:01,829
l'm sorry his teeth grinding
wakes you up.

237
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:07,001
On his high school trip,
Ryota made so much noise

238
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:09,587
grinding his teeth,

239
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,256
they made him sIeep
in a separate room.

240
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,258
The poor thing.

241
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,344
A separate room.

242
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:19,555
That wasn't me.
That was Junpei.

243
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:08,688
lf you use your thumb joint,
they fall right off.

244
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,190
You're so good.

245
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:14,402
This always
used to be my chore.

246
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:20,074
They wound up building it
as it was designed.

247
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,660
That's terrible.

248
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,413
They promised

249
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:29,000
to make it triangular
to let the sun in.

250
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,626
But it's square.

251
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,128
Exactly.

252
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:35,131
And they're still in court over it.

253
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:37,592
Oh dear.

254
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:41,679
Don't mix it up like that.

255
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,307
You have to cut into it.

256
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,017
Really?

257
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:49,145
Ηow many years
did you watch me do this?

258
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,605
All done.

259
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:56,402
So pretty.

260
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,696
Brings back memories.

261
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:44,617
Strange, right?

262
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,702
Everybody does it.

263
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:48,496
No, they don't, do they?

264
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:51,582
l only know grilled or boiled corn.

265
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:55,878
- Did your grandmother teach you?
- l wonder who it was.

266
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:57,588
Your own invention?

267
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,258
l bet - just like her flowers.

268
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,301
Ηe'll be here any minute.

269
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:05,096
Ηis eyesight's shot,
but not his nose.

270
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,853
Ηe couldn't wait for supper.

271
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,773
Ηe'd hear the corn popping

272
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:18,901
and eat them
as fast as l cooked them.

273
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,779
My brother loved them.

274
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:26,117
- You like corn, don't you, Atsushi?
- So-so.

275
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,160
Actually,
l'm so-so about corn too.

276
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,870
You'll eat a lot.

277
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:32,415
They're best hot. Go ahead.

278
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,959
With a drop of soy sauce.

279
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,299
So sweet!

280
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:47,179
Before we moved here,
our neighbors had a cornfield.

281
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,141
Sneaking in one night -

282
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,685
- You stole corn?
- Dad did.

283
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:55,479
Statute of limitation's up.
That was 30 years ago.

284
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:59,775
The next day was corn tempura.

285
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:02,570
Right as l was frying them,

286
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:04,822
there was a "hello."

287
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:06,574
The farmer came over

288
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:10,619
to give us corn,
saying they had a bumper crop.

289
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,791
Just then it started popping
in the kitchen, like just now.

290
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:20,212
She tells the same story
every time she makes tempura.

291
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,007
l sure felt awful about that.

292
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:26,844
So Junpei chimes in,

293
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:29,847
"Mother, we didn't have

294
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:33,517
to go buy that corn
at the market."

295
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:37,146
Ηe could be so smart that way.

296
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:38,814
Ηe could.

297
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,192
Just like that other time.

298
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:43,069
At the bank?

299
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:45,529
Ηe was a lifesaver.

300
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:50,493
This is going to be my room.
l'll get a blue bed.

301
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:52,536
What about me?

302
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:56,207
There's no room for you.
You're not moving here with us.

303
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:01,670
You can have that room, then.

304
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:03,672
Oh good.

305
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,800
There's a ghost at night.

306
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:07,885
Forget it.

307
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:11,305
l'm getting the piano too.

308
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:14,183
l want the piano too.

309
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:16,477
- You can't play.
- l'll learn.

310
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:19,980
You'll never play.
You even quit fencing.

311
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:22,233
Leave fencing out of this.

312
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:28,781
Daddy...

313
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:34,912
Say, how did you feel
when your daddy died?

314
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,331
l don't know.
l was little.

315
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:38,999
Did you cry?

316
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:40,835
l don't remember.

317
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:44,088
lf it were me, l'd cry.

318
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:48,426
l know. What do you call
Uncle Ryota?

319
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:50,511
The normal way...

320
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:55,766
"Daddy."

321
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:13,659
They should leave this downstairs.
Why'd they haul it up?

322
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:24,879
Are they starting to lose it?
They don't use this stuff.

323
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:28,466
They're probably lonely.

324
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:31,260
- For what?
- You know.

325
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:35,764
Ηave they said anything?

326
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,684
About my wife.

327
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,352
Not really.

328
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:42,062
lt's heavy.

329
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:45,816
Do they disapprove
that it's a second marriage?

330
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:49,487
l don't think so.
She's terrific. She's wasted on you.

331
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:53,991
Watch out.
You need to watch your step.

332
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:55,284
lt's too low.

333
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:58,496
lt's not too low.
You're too big.

334
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:01,165
Did we eat the same food?

335
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:03,501
Ouch, ouch.

336
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:15,012
No, no, his memory's shot.
Ηe can't remember the orders.

337
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:18,349
Ηe served toro sushi to the same
customer over and over again.

338
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,518
That sounds good.
Let's all go.

339
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:23,270
Please spare me.
We'll have to fold.

340
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:25,397
You've always been a joker.

341
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,942
l'm serious.
l'm not joking.

342
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:29,693
How oId is your father?

343
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:31,904
Seventy-two, l think.

344
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,031
Ηey, same as Dad.

345
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:37,409
Really?
The doctor looks much younger.

346
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:41,288
He looks vigorous.
- You call that vigorous?

347
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:43,999
Ηappily retired, right?
l'm jealous.

348
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:46,335
Ηe wanted to keep working.

349
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:49,171
But his eyes...
he got cataracts.

350
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:51,006
No, the other disease.

351
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:54,385
But they also built
a big hospital nearby.

352
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,303
lt was time for him to quit.

353
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:58,097
At least he salvaged his pride.

354
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,849
The sushi's here.

355
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,811
- Ηere's 20,000 yen.
- Thank you.

356
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:07,565
Your change is 3,000
and two million yen!

357
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:10,651
Hey, give us a discount.
Look how much we ordered.

358
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:13,404
Give me a break! l didn't tell
my wife about the sea urchin.

359
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:16,407
Ηere they are.
lt's heavy.

360
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,952
Don't eat the sea urchin.

361
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:23,163
Ηey, is that you, Satsuki?
You're so tall.

362
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,708
l grew half an inch
this summer.

363
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:27,835
l quit fencing.

364
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:31,380
- Nobody cares about your fencing club.
- l almost forgot.

365
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:38,387
My wife sent
this funeral offering.

366
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:42,391
Oh, you don't need to.
We don't say prayers anymore.

367
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:45,060
No, my wife was
behind Junpei in junior high.

368
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:47,855
She gave him chocolates
for Valentine's Day.

369
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:50,983
Really?
ln that case, thank you.

370
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:54,403
Why didn't you tell us
about this first?

371
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:58,157
l would never give you
a hard time about a discount.

372
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,284
Sorry, it just slipped my mind.

373
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,870
Getting yelled at
for making a funeral offering -

374
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:05,289
Why not come in
and light some incense?

375
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,249
l'm not dressed for it.

376
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:10,336
l've got to get back.
No telling what Dad's up to.

377
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,838
Thanks for your business.

378
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:21,263
Ηe's all grown up.

379
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:23,182
Ηe used to be a bad kid.

380
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:26,977
You never know
how he might have turned out.

381
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:32,191
I'm done.

382
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,652
You're fuII?
No more sushi?

383
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:41,158
Ηeavy.

384
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,744
Be careful, Satsuki.

385
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:48,916
- Cheater!
- Shouldn't l cut it?

386
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:51,251
They want to break it open.

387
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:56,507
You don't want to join them?

388
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:58,133
No, thank you.

389
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,094
You sure?

390
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:02,554
That handrail by the bath -

391
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:06,058
Yes, Dad fell last year.

392
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,601
l heard.

393
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:11,063
Ηe got such a big bruise
on his behind.

394
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,439
Oh no.

395
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:15,359
Because you left
the soap on the floor.

396
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,902
l did not.

397
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:20,030
Ηere we go again.
Ηe's always blaming someone else.

398
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:23,992
Ηey kids, if you hit it with those,
there'll be nothing left.

399
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:25,369
You'll smash it.

400
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:28,288
The tiles are falling off
in the bath too.

401
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:31,375
They just peel off
when they age.

402
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:33,961
l'll fix those later.

403
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:37,464
You don't have to.
You're a guest, Nobuo-san.

404
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:40,050
You're happier
doing things, right?

405
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:43,554
l'm like a tuna.
l have to keep moving or die.

406
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:46,932
l wish it would motivate him
more at work.

407
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:50,185
That machine...
he took it upstairs for me.

408
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:53,188
- The Rodeo Boy.
- Ηappy to help.

409
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:55,107
Ηurry, Daddy.

410
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:57,860
Excuse me.

411
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,613
Say, Ryota...

412
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,365
now that you have a family,

413
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:05,659
how about an RV?

414
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:08,579
l'll give you a good discount.

415
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:20,674
Living in Tokyo,
we don't need a car.

416
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:24,678
l always dreamed that my sons

417
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:28,348
would take me shopping
in their cars.

418
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:32,436
Children don't necessarily grow up
the way you want them to.

419
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:35,230
They certainly don't...

420
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:36,940
Do they...

421
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:40,819
l'll take you shopping in a car.
As often as you want. Which one?

422
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:44,948
Just you wait. Just wait.
This white one?

423
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:48,118
You've got nerve.
You don't even have a license.

424
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:50,454
- Seconds?
- l'm full.

425
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,916
You can eat more.
You're still young.

426
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:56,960
But we can't have him
getting any bigger.

427
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:59,087
Ηow old do you think l am?

428
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:01,799
Are your teeth all right?

429
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,927
You don't see a dentist, do you?

430
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,804
l'm too busy with work.

431
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:10,182
You've got bad teeth, like me.
Better watch out.

432
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:12,476
Open up wide.

433
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:15,813
Cut it out.
Not in front of the boy.

434
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,191
ls it a work call?

435
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:22,486
Yeah, well...

436
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:25,531
l got a rush job
from the Setagaya Museum.

437
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:28,659
- An oil painting?
- Yeah, something like that.

438
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:32,871
l saw an article in the newspaper
about painting restorers.

439
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:35,499
lt said "Painting Doctors."

440
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:36,583
Which paper?

441
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:39,670
l can't remember.
l'll send you a copy.

442
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:42,840
You say that, but you've
never once sent me one.

443
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:44,842
Sorry.

444
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:49,012
Well, l'm hardly
as important as a doctor.

445
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:52,224
lt's not so much medical care
as it is "anti-aging."

446
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:55,310
How lovely.
Can you help me?

447
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:58,021
What's that "anti" something?

448
00:30:58,147 --> 00:31:00,315
l think you're past it, Mom.

449
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:03,026
You're so youthful,
you don't need it.

450
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:05,195
l'm not so sure l could help.

451
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:07,906
So l'm the only one left out?

452
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:13,036
My line of work is finally
getting the spotlight.

453
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:17,040
There are more students
studying it at my alma mater.

454
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:22,045
But when it comes time for jobs,
it's competitive.

455
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,173
Apparently.

456
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,217
You always

457
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:30,596
had such nimble fingers.

458
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:35,434
- You can really drink!
- l take after my mother.

459
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,769
Yukie-san could drink too.

460
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,938
You could match her.

461
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,399
My brother's wife.

462
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:44,860
l wonder where she's living.

463
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:48,614
The address on her New Year's
card hadn't changed: Tokorozawa.

464
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:51,450
Wonder how she is.

465
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:55,579
lf they'd had children,
we could invite her.

466
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:58,999
Now that she's remarried,
she can't really visit.

467
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:05,005
ln some ways it was good
they hadn't had children yet.

468
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:09,092
A widowed single mom's
harder to marry off.

469
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:16,558
Luckily a wonderful man
wanted me.

470
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:20,604
No, no, we're lucky
you took him.

471
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,564
That's not for you to say.

472
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:27,444
Yukari-san, would you like to see
Ryota's childhood pictures?

473
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:28,987
Yes, please.

474
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:31,114
You'd show her
even if she didn't.

475
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:35,202
l want to get some
of the pictures of me in college.

476
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:36,954
Atsushi, you too.

477
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:39,957
Did it break?
Did you break it open?

478
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,166
Not yet!

479
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:43,126
Not yet.

480
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:47,589
We'll leave the two doctors
to discuss things.

481
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:01,353
What about -

482
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:07,859
What happened with repairing
the Takamatsu-zuka murals?

483
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:12,322
Restoration, not repair.

484
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:16,827
There was a long dispute
about whether to preserve

485
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:20,914
the tomb as is or to conserve
that national treasure, that mural,

486
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,709
Asuka Beauty,
that they made into a stamp.

487
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:28,463
Ultimately, the Ministry of Culture
ruled to dismantle it,

488
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:31,508
in a rare upset
for local cultural preservation.

489
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:34,302
lt'll take at least 1 0 years to -

490
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:39,850
That's a precious plant!
Don't do that!

491
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:41,810
Sorry.

492
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:52,070
Are you making a living?

493
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,285
Enough to support
a widowed single mom.

494
00:33:58,411 --> 00:33:59,619
There.

495
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:01,788
Ηit it!

496
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:06,418
There's a crack!

497
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:08,879
- Wow.
- lt broke open.

498
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:38,241
It's hard to beIieve, but they
used to go to concerts together.

499
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,160
Classical music.

500
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:44,331
Dad's so impatient,
he'd waIk fast and get way ahead.

501
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:49,169
We were always racing
to catch up with him.

502
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:52,464
Look, Mom.
You're in Ηibiya Park.

503
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,633
You look like you're in love.

504
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:57,594
Back when
l didn't know anything.

505
00:34:58,387 --> 00:35:03,183
This is just the three kids in this yard.
This is Ryota.

506
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:07,813
- Let's see.
- Was he Atsushi's age?

507
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,107
l think about fifth or sixth grade.

508
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:13,110
The crape myrtle's still small.

509
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:16,404
We planted that
right after we moved here.

510
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:19,616
The flowers were a brighter red
than they are now.

511
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:21,785
You think?

512
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:24,496
This is when
we all went clam digging.

513
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:28,625
This is Junpei.
This is Ryota.

514
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:31,711
Say, he looks like he's crying.

515
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:34,464
Whenever he heard,
"Look at the camera and smile,"

516
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:37,592
he would just
freeze up like this -

517
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:43,306
But he's really lightened up
since back then.

518
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:46,434
- ls that true?
- We owe it to you.

519
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:47,853
Not at all.

520
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:52,566
Oh look, an essay.
From when Ryo was in grade school.

521
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:55,110
"When l grow up,

522
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:58,280
l'm going to be a doctor
like my father.

523
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:01,366
My brother will be a surgeon.
l'll be an internist."

524
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:03,034
Did you know this?

525
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,286
No, never.

526
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:07,998
l was sure he always
wanted to be a painter.

527
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:11,918
"My father always wears
his white lab coat.

528
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:16,506
When a patient calls,
even at night, he takes his bag -"

529
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:18,008
Don't read that.

530
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:21,052
Who cares?
Why are you so embarrassed?

531
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:24,181
You don't need
to keep this stuff around.

532
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:32,814
See?

533
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:36,776
Ηe can be exactly like Dad.

534
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:38,904
Ηe just takes things seriously.

535
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:43,033
Ηe can't compromise
the way Junpei could.

536
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:47,537
lf one of them had taken over
their father's clinic,

537
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:50,207
things might have been different.

538
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:54,211
- Let's have some watermelon.
- Good idea.

539
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:56,963
Put these away.

540
00:36:58,257 --> 00:37:00,634
Everybody Iine up now.

541
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:07,224
Okay, okay, picture, picture.

542
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,016
Come here.

543
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:13,480
- Look, Mom.
- What? It's so dirty.

544
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,191
- A chocoIate stain.
- It'II stand out.

545
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:19,819
- Wear it inside out.
- No.

546
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:23,323
PIease cover it up then.
It Iooks so dirty.

547
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:25,033
Grandpa,
pIease stand to the side.

548
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:27,118
Where are you going, Mom?

549
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:33,917
Sorry, we're all here now.

550
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:36,920
lt's not a funeral.
That's bad luck.

551
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:39,965
lt's fine. Besides,
we're all here because of him.

552
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,758
l know, but -

553
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:43,551
You're not in it, Grandpa.

554
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:46,388
Grandpa, please step in
to the left.

555
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:50,976
Just a little more.

556
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:54,604
Grandpa.

557
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:57,440
Did he go to the bathroom?

558
00:37:57,566 --> 00:38:01,820
- We can add his memorial photo later.
- Ηe's not dead yet.

559
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:06,283
SmiIe, everyone.
You too, Ryo.

560
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:08,451
And he's laughing.

561
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:13,123
- We're off!
- Watch for cars!

562
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:17,419
ls it hot?

563
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:30,367
Knock, knock.

564
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:40,752
Do you have to do that now?

565
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,004
Why?

566
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:45,924
Why don't you come
talk with us?

567
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:48,843
About what?

568
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:50,720
lt doesn't matter.

569
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:54,099
Like about preserving tombs,
or whatever.

570
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:06,069
Ryo was worried.

571
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:10,865
About what?

572
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:14,744
Ηow you feel about his wife.

573
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:18,540
lt's his life.
Let him do what he wants.

574
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:20,917
You're so cold.

575
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:24,254
You weren't like that with Junpei.

576
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,755
Of course not.

577
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:27,924
Ηe was my heir.

578
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:30,427
Ryo left the family.

579
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:38,935
What?

580
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:41,855
lt was my hard work
that built this house.

581
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:46,192
Why do you call it
"Grandma's house"?

582
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:57,162
Ηe's so petty!

583
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:00,457
Oh, there's a trick to that.

584
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:05,962
lf you go like this,
and then at the right spot -

585
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,965
Then to hold it in place,
you do this.

586
00:41:09,091 --> 00:41:10,884
Says he doesn't want any.

587
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:13,803
Says tempura's
all he wants to talk about.

588
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:17,140
Just leave him be.
Ηe'll come back when he's hungry,

589
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:18,975
just like your crows.

590
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:21,603
They only come
on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

591
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:24,772
Ηe's still a kid,
even at his age.

592
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:35,408
Oh no.
Guess even tunas take naps.

593
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:38,077
He just finds
the tatami floor relaxing.

594
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:41,080
Yeah, our house
doesn't have any tatami.

595
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:42,707
You should get some.

596
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:46,419
lmpossible.
Our house isn't built that way.

597
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:50,757
Which is why when we move here,
we'll build a tatami room.

598
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:53,009
When are you moving?

599
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:57,180
Ηopefully before Mutsu goes
to junior high school.

600
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:59,224
lt's not definite yet.

601
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:02,352
But l showed you the blueprints.

602
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:04,604
Don't catch cold.

603
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:13,905
Like they say, when you age,
it's best to live with your daughter.

604
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:15,865
Depends on the daughter.

605
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:17,242
An ashtray...

606
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:20,745
We'll live together
but keep separate kitchens.

607
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:23,873
Of course we're happy to eat
whatever you cook.

608
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:28,378
All l'll do is look after you.
l might as well be a maid.

609
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:35,385
The body of Hagiwara Mikio,
a 53 year-oId empIoyee from Yokohama,

610
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,595
was discovered today on the beach...

611
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:40,557
Oh no.
lt's supposed to be autumn.

612
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:44,686
The night before,

613
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:48,439
he had made a rare visit alone
and stayed over.

614
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:52,402
That day,
he was shining his shoes.

615
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,737
Suddenly he said,
"l'm going to the beach."

616
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:56,906
By the time l said,
"Be careful" -

617
00:42:57,032 --> 00:42:58,908
We're home.

618
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:01,244
- Where were you?
- A secret.

619
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:03,288
- You're sweaty.
- Here.

620
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:05,456
- You didn't pick it.
- No.

621
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:08,835
Only his beautifully polished shoes
were left behind.

622
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:12,505
l'll never forget
the sight of his shoes.

623
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:15,174
Ηave ice tea, not ice cream.

624
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:19,012
lf only l'd said
something to him sooner.

625
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:22,056
- Ηere we go again.
- Oh let me, at least today.

626
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:24,642
lf only it were just today.

627
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:27,270
Ηe didn't have to save him.

628
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:30,023
lt wasn't even his own child.

629
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:37,697
Maybe l'll fix us a snack.

630
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:39,991
No, we've had plenty.

631
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:42,535
Well, you're all here.

632
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:08,019
After you pat it round,
use your thumb to make a beIIy button.

633
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:10,480
Ηere's another one.

634
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:13,149
What's that?

635
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:15,485
- Poop.
- Whose poop?

636
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:18,237
- Daddy's.
- Daddy's?

637
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:22,492
Poop? l used to make those
when l was a kid.

638
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:33,670
You should use our phone.

639
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:38,508
That Vietnamese place
was good, right?

640
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:40,968
l'm stepping outside.

641
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:43,638
ls it work?

642
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:46,349
Yes, probably.

643
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:50,353
Ηe's so busy.
Does he come home late?

644
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:52,271
Ηe's had a lot of overtime.

645
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:56,567
Ηe's still in his 40s.
He'll be fine.

646
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:58,778
Whose oil painting?

647
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:04,992
- A van Gogh?
- l doubt it's a van Gogh.

648
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:08,371
How much does he get
for restoring one painting?

649
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:12,208
lt's a lot of work.

650
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:14,210
Ηow much did you say?

651
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:16,629
l'm asking her how much.

652
00:45:16,755 --> 00:45:20,049
Ηere's your reward
for helping Grandma.

653
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:21,050
Thank you.

654
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:22,885
- Mutsu.
- Thank you.

655
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:26,055
We love Grandma's house.

656
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:28,015
Where's Atsushi?

657
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:31,788
Not to worry.
lt's not a big deal.

658
00:46:36,418 --> 00:46:39,670
Listen, by the way...

659
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:44,050
do you know anyone
at Shinbido Publishers?

660
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:48,846
Yeah, l figured not.

661
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:51,474
Oh hello.

662
00:46:57,856 --> 00:47:02,068
Let's all get together
for dinner soon.

663
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:07,198
You don't have
to invite Mishima.

664
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:38,104
"Ηomoclomin...

665
00:47:39,314 --> 00:47:41,482
Prolmon...

666
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:45,736
Tryptanol...

667
00:47:47,614 --> 00:47:49,699
Neophagen..."

668
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:03,713
Don't touch the medicine.

669
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:12,722
Come here.

670
00:48:18,645 --> 00:48:20,563
- Ηere.
- Grandma already -

671
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:22,690
This is from your Grandpa.

672
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:25,568
Ηave a seat.

673
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:31,574
What do you want to be
when you grow up?

674
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:34,118
What? A soccer player?

675
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:36,120
A piano tuner.

676
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:39,457
A tuner? Why?

677
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:46,464
Just spit it out. Ηere.

678
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:51,636
Because l like
my music teacher.

679
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:55,431
A woman?

680
00:48:58,393 --> 00:49:03,773
The idea that a man be swayed
by some woman in his career choice...

681
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:06,734
Show me your fingers.

682
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:13,783
You seem nimble.

683
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:18,162
My father got sick
when l was a kid too,

684
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:20,748
so l decided to become a doctor.

685
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:23,209
Did he get better?

686
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:25,670
Your father.

687
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:29,298
He died
before l became a doctor.

688
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:36,639
Being a doctor is good.
lt's a worthwhile job.

689
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:44,146
You go play.

690
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:54,657
Please don't give him
any ideas.

691
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,662
l won't let him be a doctor.

692
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:03,916
lt's not like l can afford
to wait another 20 years.

693
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:05,960
l can't help that.

694
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:08,045
l wasn't talking to you.

695
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:12,008
l know that.

696
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:37,158
Taking a little break.

697
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:40,036
Sure, you should rest.

698
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:43,330
You must be tired
keeping Dad and Mom company.

699
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:53,049
About that phone call -
turns out they don't need me.

700
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:56,719
Oh, the Setagaya Museum?

701
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:04,226
You just made all that up.

702
00:51:04,352 --> 00:51:07,688
l didn't really have a choice.

703
00:51:09,941 --> 00:51:12,777
- So it's a Chagall.
- What is?

704
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:16,781
- The oil painting you're restoring.
- A Chagall?

705
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:21,118
What are you going to do
with all these?

706
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:24,246
l'm storing them
for when l need them.

707
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:28,584
When are you ever
going to need

708
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:30,753
this many paper bags?

709
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:33,839
And the refrigerator's stuffed,
as always.

710
00:51:33,965 --> 00:51:36,258
l feel safe when it's full.

711
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:40,846
Refrigerators aren't
to make you feel safe.

712
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:45,059
They're to keep things cold.

713
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:47,269
Ηey...

714
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:50,439
does Dad play Pachinko?

715
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:53,692
lt's you?

716
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:56,821
What do you care
if l play Pachinko?

717
00:51:56,947 --> 00:52:00,491
There are other things,
like haiku and yoga.

718
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:03,452
l feel so relieved when l hear
that Pachinko sound.

719
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:05,246
Sure, Mom.

720
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:09,959
You've earned the right to spend
on whatever you please.

721
00:52:12,337 --> 00:52:14,004
Listen...

722
00:52:14,589 --> 00:52:16,298
what about this house?

723
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:18,134
What about it?

724
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:21,887
Well, you know,
if you don't want us,

725
00:52:22,013 --> 00:52:24,265
we don't want
to force ourselves on you.

726
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:26,809
l haven't said we don't want you.
lt's just that -

727
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:28,060
lt's just what?

728
00:52:28,186 --> 00:52:31,313
l think your father won't like it.

729
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:35,818
You only bring up Dad
when it's convenient.

730
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:39,071
lf we knock down
the examining room

731
00:52:39,197 --> 00:52:43,200
and make separate residences,
we can both be independent.

732
00:52:43,368 --> 00:52:47,580
l didn't know we made those sweets
from rice flour, did you?

733
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:49,874
Of course not.

734
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:53,836
lt's getting cooler.
Let's go visit his grave.

735
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:56,130
What about you?

736
00:52:56,256 --> 00:52:58,883
l'm fine.
l went recently.

737
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:02,803
ln that case, l'll join you instead.
lt'll be a nice walk.

738
00:53:02,929 --> 00:53:06,265
- l'd better wear a hat.
- Sure, why not?

739
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:09,768
Why does she get so excited?

740
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:11,729
lt's just visiting a grave.

741
00:53:46,848 --> 00:53:51,101
l wonder who left these flowers.
His widow?

742
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:53,312
lf she came this far, she'd visit.

743
00:53:53,438 --> 00:53:55,439
Guess you're right.

744
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:58,734
Maybe it was Yoshio.

745
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:01,862
He'd never do
anything so thoughtful.

746
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:04,698
- Tossing them?
- Ours won't fit.

747
00:54:04,824 --> 00:54:06,951
l'll light incense.

748
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:24,260
lt was so hot all day.

749
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:27,972
The water must feel good.

750
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:53,205
There's nothing more unbearable...

751
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:57,710
than praying
at your child's grave.

752
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:02,840
l never did anything
to deserve this.

753
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:14,685
What do you want, Mom?

754
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:19,356
Ηer husband's perfectly nice...

755
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:22,526
but l'm too old to live
with a stranger.

756
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:24,820
And the kids sure make
a lot of noise.

757
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:26,905
So you don't want them to.

758
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:28,574
Besides...

759
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:32,703
if they move back,
it makes it harder for you to.

760
00:55:33,246 --> 00:55:36,623
Me? l can't move back.

761
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:39,209
l mean, after your father dies.

762
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:41,587
After he dies...

763
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:44,340
You know l can't take
my brother's place.

764
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:47,051
Of course l know that.

765
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:48,719
ln that case...

766
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:55,351
Are you two
going to have children?

767
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:57,186
Where'd that come from?

768
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:59,396
You should think it over.

769
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:02,441
lt's harder to divorce
with children.

770
00:56:04,277 --> 00:56:07,196
What are you talking about?

771
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:11,742
lsn't the line normally,
"l can't wait for grandkids"?

772
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:14,119
Your family isn't normal.

773
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:17,831
These days we're not abnormal.

774
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:32,179
You used to catch butterflies
in Karuizawa

775
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:35,057
with your father.
You remember?

776
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:36,975
l don't.

777
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:41,397
Let's go visit
your father's grave too.

778
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:43,649
Whatever.

779
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:47,486
Oh, it's not "whatever."

780
00:56:54,702 --> 00:56:56,787
Look, a yellow butterfly.

781
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:04,378
They say butterflies
that survive the winter

782
00:57:04,504 --> 00:57:07,089
come back yellow
the following year.

783
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:10,134
Really?
Sounds made-up to me.

784
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:13,846
- That's what l heard.
- From whom?

785
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:15,764
l can't remember.

786
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:22,813
Ever since l heard that,
whenever l see yellow butterflies,

787
00:57:23,189 --> 00:57:25,566
it just breaks my heart.

788
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:40,456
Climbing this hill
gets harder every year.

789
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:44,835
ln a car,
you'd be up here in a flash.

790
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:48,255
lt's better for you to walk.

791
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:51,842
You're right.
lt's good exercise.

792
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:10,777
So you're graduating
from college?

793
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:12,613
Yes. Thanks for asking.

794
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:13,989
Ηave you found work?

795
00:58:14,115 --> 00:58:17,659
l wanted a job in the media,
but l got turned down everywhere.

796
00:58:17,827 --> 00:58:20,662
And that drama school?

797
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:23,790
Sorry, l quit that two years ago.

798
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:26,210
Oh, l see.
What a shame.

799
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:29,338
That's what you said
to him last year.

800
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:30,964
l did?

801
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:36,345
l'm helping out at a small ad agency.
Maybe l'll get a job there.

802
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:38,222
That's perfectly fine, right?

803
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:42,851
When l say ads,
l mean more like supermarket flyers.

804
00:58:42,977 --> 00:58:46,813
- Did you take their exam?
- Nothing formal like that.

805
00:58:47,315 --> 00:58:48,857
Thanks.

806
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:52,486
l figure l'll keep
helping out there for now.

807
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:58,534
Well, in any case, nothing's more
important than your health.

808
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:01,578
Well, my health is my only asset.

809
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:10,504
Um, seriously...

810
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:13,215
if Junpei-san
hadn't saved me back then,

811
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:15,717
l wouldn't be here now.

812
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:18,887
l just feel so sorry

813
00:59:19,597 --> 00:59:21,682
and so grateful.

814
00:59:22,433 --> 00:59:24,101
Thank you so much.

815
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:29,356
l'll live my life
for Junpei-san too.

816
00:59:55,049 --> 00:59:57,301
Well, l should be going...

817
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:03,724
Oh, sorry.

818
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:05,934
Your legs okay?

819
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:13,650
- They're numb from the tatami.
- There's a step there.

820
01:00:15,653 --> 01:00:18,238
l'm sorry.
l can walk now.

821
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:22,451
You're just 25.
You can be anything you want.

822
01:00:22,744 --> 01:00:26,413
No, l can see my life
won't go anywhere.

823
01:00:26,539 --> 01:00:31,168
Come again next year.
Promise, okay?

824
01:00:31,836 --> 01:00:35,297
We'll be waiting.

825
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:39,718
l will.

826
01:00:40,094 --> 01:00:42,804
Well, if you'll excuse me...

827
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:47,059
Take care.

828
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:50,354
Sorry.

829
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,314
Ηe got even fatter.

830
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:56,026
Ηe must weigh over 220 pounds.
All that fat across his back.

831
01:00:56,152 --> 01:00:59,988
Ηe had two of the desserts
he brought for us.

832
01:01:00,156 --> 01:01:03,408
- And three glasses of ice tea.
- No wonder he's fat.

833
01:01:03,534 --> 01:01:07,079
Look, his sweat!
Ηere too! Disgusting!

834
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:11,166
Ηe even used the wrong
conjugation thanking us

835
01:01:11,292 --> 01:01:13,293
for Junpei saving his life.

836
01:01:13,419 --> 01:01:15,837
We should've given him
the Rodeo Boy.

837
01:01:15,963 --> 01:01:19,174
You're right.
Go chase him down at the bus stop.

838
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:20,676
Ryo.

839
01:01:20,802 --> 01:01:22,260
Not me.

840
01:01:24,263 --> 01:01:25,764
That...

841
01:01:26,766 --> 01:01:29,726
that useless piece of trash.
Why'd my son have to save him?

842
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:33,563
There were plenty of others.

843
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:39,111
Please don't call him "useless"
and "trash" in front of the kids.

844
01:01:41,906 --> 01:01:44,574
"A job in the media."
So pretentious.

845
01:01:45,076 --> 01:01:47,619
Ηe wasn't being pretentious.

846
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:52,416
The truth is he's barely
got part-time work.

847
01:01:53,626 --> 01:01:55,961
What's wrong with that?
He's still young.

848
01:01:56,087 --> 01:01:58,630
Ηis body just keeps growing.

849
01:01:59,298 --> 01:02:02,384
There's no point
in him being alive.

850
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:04,803
You heard him apologizing.

851
01:02:04,929 --> 01:02:08,056
Apologizing for being alive.

852
01:02:08,266 --> 01:02:10,183
Just like that novelist -
who was it?

853
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:13,395
No, like that comedian
who keeps apologizing.

854
01:02:16,941 --> 01:02:20,819
We're not talking
about novelists or comedians.

855
01:02:22,488 --> 01:02:24,948
Stop comparing
his life to others'.

856
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:27,951
One of his socks was black.

857
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:30,245
Ηe's doing the best he can.

858
01:02:31,205 --> 01:02:33,790
Things don't always work out
the way you want.

859
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:36,585
Ηow can you sit
in judgment, Dad,

860
01:02:36,711 --> 01:02:39,004
calling him
"useless" and "trash"?

861
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:40,338
Don't laugh!

862
01:02:40,465 --> 01:02:42,924
What happened?
Wipe it up with this.

863
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:45,385
You don't need to yell.

864
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:49,514
What are you so defensive about?
This has nothing to do with you!

865
01:02:52,727 --> 01:02:54,728
ls being a doctor so important?

866
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,858
Advertising is a fine profession.

867
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:07,282
Who knows how Junpei would have
turned out if he were still alive.

868
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:09,534
We're only human.

869
01:03:30,598 --> 01:03:33,809
l heard "useless trash"
and thought

870
01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:36,978
you were talking about me.
l was scared to come out.

871
01:03:37,146 --> 01:03:39,856
Thank God you were
talking about Yoshio.

872
01:03:40,775 --> 01:03:44,069
lf only he'd lose a little weight.

873
01:03:44,612 --> 01:03:47,489
He looks like that former
sumo wrestler - who was it?

874
01:03:47,615 --> 01:03:49,074
Takamiyama?

875
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:53,453
No, he's the one from Ηawaii
who's in those commercials.

876
01:03:53,579 --> 01:03:57,999
l mean the one with the face
like a mid-belly, like this.

877
01:03:58,125 --> 01:03:59,960
What's a mid-belly?

878
01:04:00,086 --> 01:04:02,796
l think it's time to go.
Our driver's awake now.

879
01:04:02,922 --> 01:04:05,507
- Going home so soon?
- Yes, we are.

880
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:11,054
Get ready!

881
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:15,475
Nobody asked him
to live Junpei's life!

882
01:04:15,601 --> 01:04:17,102
Ryota, buy an RV.

883
01:04:17,228 --> 01:04:21,064
We'd better put those desserts
in the refrigerator.

884
01:04:22,149 --> 01:04:24,359
Atsushi, can you bring
those desserts here?

885
01:04:25,069 --> 01:04:28,029
Can you find a spot
for them somewhere?

886
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:30,991
There's no room.
Oh dear, in there.

887
01:04:31,284 --> 01:04:32,826
- From Grandma?
- Three thousand yen.

888
01:04:32,952 --> 01:04:34,619
Three thousand yen.

889
01:04:34,745 --> 01:04:37,706
Grandma seemed to be
enjoying herseIf.

890
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:41,376
Of course she was.
The best thing for her

891
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:43,295
is to be with her family.

892
01:04:43,421 --> 01:04:45,130
Did we earn some points with her?

893
01:04:45,339 --> 01:04:49,634
l don't know.
She won't come out and agree to it.

894
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:53,597
She wants to preserve her son's room.
l can understand how she feels.

895
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:56,057
Ηe's got it good.

896
01:04:56,225 --> 01:05:00,312
We've got our hands full
taking care of the living.

897
01:05:00,479 --> 01:05:03,440
You'd prefer she look out
for her living daughter?

898
01:05:03,774 --> 01:05:05,233
Of course.

899
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:09,362
My brother's ghost isn't going
to look after them in their old age.

900
01:05:28,466 --> 01:05:30,550
Don't worry.

901
01:05:30,676 --> 01:05:33,178
lt's not that expensive.
lt's light.

902
01:05:33,971 --> 01:05:38,099
lt doesn't matter what it costs.

903
01:05:38,309 --> 01:05:41,353
lt's not like l'm going
to buy more than one.

904
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:48,652
Does Mother have
her own cell phone?

905
01:05:49,987 --> 01:05:51,404
lt's right there.

906
01:05:52,156 --> 01:05:56,284
When she makes calls,
she goes and uses our home phone.

907
01:05:57,536 --> 01:06:00,747
The fool doesn't trust phones
without cords.

908
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:04,501
Says to keep this here.

909
01:06:06,837 --> 01:06:09,422
What?
What's so funny?

910
01:06:09,548 --> 01:06:11,216
Nothing at all.

911
01:06:11,342 --> 01:06:14,302
They should have stayed
for supper too.

912
01:06:14,428 --> 01:06:15,971
Oh no.

913
01:06:16,097 --> 01:06:18,682
l couldn't stand to have
their whole gang

914
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:21,226
hanging around all night.

915
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:27,315
Sushi for lunch and eel for dinner.
l'm impressed.

916
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:32,153
l shouldn't have fried
so much tempura. What a waste.

917
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:34,906
Maybe l'll take
some tempura home.

918
01:06:35,032 --> 01:06:39,160
Leftover tempura isn't any good.
lt loses its crunch.

919
01:06:39,954 --> 01:06:41,997
l'm glad we got the deluxe.

920
01:06:42,164 --> 01:06:46,334
Anything less and they only
give you instant soup.

921
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:50,839
Can you eat this?

922
01:06:50,965 --> 01:06:53,174
Sure you can.

923
01:06:53,718 --> 01:06:56,678
You don't have to.
Grandpa'll eat it for you.

924
01:07:00,099 --> 01:07:03,685
Grandma'll give you
some eel instead.

925
01:07:03,811 --> 01:07:07,230
- You're so lucky.
- l can't eat all this rice. Ηere.

926
01:07:07,898 --> 01:07:10,650
Don't dump your rice
on top of my eel, Mom.

927
01:07:10,776 --> 01:07:13,486
lnside your stomach
it's all the same.

928
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:18,116
She's never had
a delicate bone

929
01:07:18,242 --> 01:07:19,534
in her body.

930
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:23,538
What do you mean, delicate?
You're hardly one to talk.

931
01:07:24,582 --> 01:07:28,877
l take her to concerts,
and she always falls asleep, snoring.

932
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:31,504
When was that, dear?

933
01:07:32,089 --> 01:07:36,718
There are so many records
in the room next door.

934
01:07:37,553 --> 01:07:40,138
l used to be quite a collector
in my youth.

935
01:07:40,264 --> 01:07:43,892
Now it's just decoration.
Ηe hardly listens to them.

936
01:07:44,018 --> 01:07:45,977
They just take up space.

937
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:51,983
l associate physicians
with classical music.

938
01:07:52,234 --> 01:07:55,737
Ηe was just the doctor
at a local clinic.

939
01:07:56,572 --> 01:08:00,533
But in an emergency, it's good
to have a doctor in the house.

940
01:08:01,243 --> 01:08:03,912
Not necessarily.
Ηe was so busy,

941
01:08:04,497 --> 01:08:08,166
he couldn't be here
when his own son was dying.

942
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:13,338
l couldn't help it. l had a rash
of food-poisoning patients.

943
01:08:13,422 --> 01:08:15,256
Eat this.

944
01:08:15,424 --> 01:08:20,136
You don't have a clue
how important work is to a man.

945
01:08:20,262 --> 01:08:23,264
l've never worked,
not even once.

946
01:08:23,432 --> 01:08:26,059
Not that he works anymore.

947
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:32,440
What other music
do you listen to?

948
01:08:34,819 --> 01:08:36,152
Well, jazz.

949
01:08:36,278 --> 01:08:40,115
lt's outdated, but Miles Davis.

950
01:08:40,324 --> 01:08:43,368
l can tolerate
up to about the Beatles.

951
01:08:44,036 --> 01:08:48,706
But this recent rap crap -
you can't call that music.

952
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:50,083
You're right.

953
01:08:50,209 --> 01:08:51,793
At karaoke,

954
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:55,380
apparently he sings
Japanese ballads.

955
01:08:56,215 --> 01:08:57,632
Karaoke?

956
01:08:57,758 --> 01:09:00,844
l read it on Shimazu-san's
New Year's card.

957
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:04,722
"l look forward to hearing you
sing 'Pleiades' again."

958
01:09:05,099 --> 01:09:07,183
Don't read people's mail.

959
01:09:07,309 --> 01:09:10,311
lt was a New Year's card.
l couldn't help it.

960
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:14,524
lf you don't like it, have your
friends seal them in envelopes.

961
01:09:15,067 --> 01:09:17,110
Japanese ballads, huh?

962
01:09:18,696 --> 01:09:20,655
"Pleiades" is not a ballad.

963
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:23,158
lt's classier than that.

964
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:30,039
Don't you two have
a special romantic song?

965
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:31,791
Nothing like that.

966
01:09:31,917 --> 01:09:35,128
- Yes, there's a record.
- What is it?

967
01:09:36,964 --> 01:09:40,466
lt's a cherished pop song.
Want to hear it?

968
01:09:53,939 --> 01:09:55,565
Last year...

969
01:09:55,691 --> 01:09:59,485
she got tricked into buying
"Favorite Pop Songs" by maiI order.

970
01:09:59,612 --> 01:10:03,448
A 30-album set.
Who knows what it cost.

971
01:10:03,741 --> 01:10:05,700
l saw it in my room.

972
01:10:06,076 --> 01:10:08,494
She's never listened to it -

973
01:10:08,621 --> 01:10:10,747
l wasn't tricked.

974
01:10:10,873 --> 01:10:13,374
Ηow insulting.
l'm not senile.

975
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:15,043
What song?

976
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:18,213
- Play it on the stereo.
- Now?

977
01:10:20,758 --> 01:10:23,927
- lsn't the needle rusted?
- lt plays fine.

978
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:36,689
Ηow does this work again?

979
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,109
What kind of song is it?

980
01:10:41,195 --> 01:10:43,488
Ηow should l know?
lt's got nothing to do with me.

981
01:10:43,614 --> 01:10:47,033
lt has everything
to do with you.

982
01:11:20,401 --> 01:11:21,985
Mom, this song -

983
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:26,823
The city lights
are so pretty, aren't they

984
01:11:27,074 --> 01:11:29,033
Yokohama

985
01:11:29,451 --> 01:11:33,162
Blue light Yokohama

986
01:11:33,789 --> 01:11:41,963
I'm so happy aIone with you

987
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:48,136
When is this song from?

988
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:51,681
About 1 970.
Right before Expo '70.

989
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:55,351
l remember
you sang it sometimes.

990
01:12:03,861 --> 01:12:08,114
StiII waIking, on and on

991
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:12,243
But I onIy sway
like a little boat

992
01:12:12,828 --> 01:12:17,248
l sway gently

993
01:12:17,958 --> 01:12:21,669
In your arms

994
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:32,597
Only our footsteps follow us
Yokohama

995
01:12:33,807 --> 01:12:37,685
Blue light Yokohama

996
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:43,024
Your gentle kiss...

997
01:12:53,827 --> 01:12:55,995
l'll leave your fresh clothes here.

998
01:12:58,707 --> 01:13:00,375
With your towel.

999
01:13:01,043 --> 01:13:03,044
When did you buy that?

1000
01:13:03,629 --> 01:13:05,296
The record?

1001
01:13:06,382 --> 01:13:10,385
About the time... at ltabashi.

1002
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:15,640
l carried Ryota, strapped to my back,
all the way to that woman's apartment.

1003
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:19,477
l could hear your voice
singing from her room.

1004
01:13:22,815 --> 01:13:27,360
StiII waIking, on and on

1005
01:13:28,112 --> 01:13:31,489
l didn't want to interrupt you,
so l went straight home.

1006
01:13:31,615 --> 01:13:35,952
The next day, l bought it
at the Canary Records by the station.

1007
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:40,873
Please leave your washcloth
hanging out to dry.

1008
01:13:49,258 --> 01:13:52,218
Remember how Mom said,
"lt plays fine"?

1009
01:13:53,095 --> 01:13:56,973
You know she plays it
when she's alone.

1010
01:13:57,766 --> 01:14:00,560
Kind of gives you the creeps.

1011
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:03,104
That's not true.

1012
01:14:04,148 --> 01:14:06,107
What's strange about that?

1013
01:14:06,525 --> 01:14:07,859
Yeah?

1014
01:14:08,318 --> 01:14:12,238
Everybody has a song
they listen to on the sly.

1015
01:14:14,616 --> 01:14:17,410
- You think?
- Of course.

1016
01:14:19,621 --> 01:14:22,290
So you have one too?

1017
01:14:25,627 --> 01:14:28,379
Which one? Tell me.

1018
01:14:29,631 --> 01:14:31,466
lt's a secret.

1019
01:14:34,553 --> 01:14:36,971
Women are so scary.

1020
01:14:37,973 --> 01:14:40,141
People are scary.

1021
01:14:40,893 --> 01:14:42,477
Everyone is.

1022
01:15:21,683 --> 01:15:24,727
l bet there's a baseball game on.
Want to watch?

1023
01:15:26,021 --> 01:15:29,690
We put a dish on the roof.
You can watch extra channels.

1024
01:15:29,816 --> 01:15:31,484
Not really.

1025
01:15:34,738 --> 01:15:38,199
There's not much to watch
on TV these days.

1026
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:44,038
There's nothing funny,
but they laugh so loud.

1027
01:15:44,456 --> 01:15:46,624
That laughter isn't real, is it?

1028
01:15:47,501 --> 01:15:49,210
So they say.

1029
01:15:57,386 --> 01:15:59,053
Ηere.

1030
01:15:59,304 --> 01:16:00,513
What's that?

1031
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:04,141
You treated us to a real feast today.
Why don't you treat yourself?

1032
01:16:04,268 --> 01:16:08,437
My, an allowance
from my own son.

1033
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:10,231
Ηow wonderful.

1034
01:16:10,357 --> 01:16:11,899
You're always treating us.

1035
01:16:12,067 --> 01:16:14,193
ln that case, thank you.

1036
01:16:15,195 --> 01:16:17,321
What shall l buy?

1037
01:16:19,533 --> 01:16:21,909
What was
that sumo wrestler's name?

1038
01:16:22,953 --> 01:16:24,495
Still on your mind?

1039
01:16:24,621 --> 01:16:27,456
Solving these things
keeps your mind active.

1040
01:16:27,583 --> 01:16:29,667
- Waka-no-hana?
- Not him.

1041
01:16:30,711 --> 01:16:34,005
- Kita-no-fuji?
- Ηe was really handsome.

1042
01:16:34,131 --> 01:16:38,593
No, he was more loveable.

1043
01:16:45,767 --> 01:16:47,143
Say...

1044
01:16:48,645 --> 01:16:51,439
isn't it time
we let Yoshio off the hook?

1045
01:16:52,357 --> 01:16:54,358
Let's stop inviting him.

1046
01:16:56,862 --> 01:16:58,821
Why?

1047
01:16:59,656 --> 01:17:01,866
l feel sorry for him.

1048
01:17:01,992 --> 01:17:04,785
lt seems painful
for him to see us.

1049
01:17:05,746 --> 01:17:07,997
That's why we invite him.

1050
01:17:12,878 --> 01:17:16,881
Can't have him forgetting
after just a dozen years.

1051
01:17:19,092 --> 01:17:23,304
lt was his fault Junpei died.

1052
01:17:24,181 --> 01:17:25,598
But Yoshio didn't -

1053
01:17:25,724 --> 01:17:29,060
lt makes no difference.
Not to a parent.

1054
01:17:30,896 --> 01:17:34,982
Not having someone to hate
makes it all the worse for me.

1055
01:17:38,654 --> 01:17:40,738
So once a year

1056
01:17:40,864 --> 01:17:44,784
l make him feel awful too.

1057
01:17:46,119 --> 01:17:49,038
Will the gods punish me for that?

1058
01:17:52,918 --> 01:17:57,797
So l'll invite him next year
and the year after.

1059
01:18:03,387 --> 01:18:06,097
That's what you keep
inviting him here for?

1060
01:18:07,599 --> 01:18:09,350
You're cruel.

1061
01:18:09,518 --> 01:18:11,686
l'm not cruel.

1062
01:18:12,896 --> 01:18:15,231
l think it's normal.

1063
01:18:15,357 --> 01:18:18,526
Everyone keeps
using that word.

1064
01:18:19,069 --> 01:18:22,154
When you get to be a parent,
you'll find out.

1065
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:25,533
- l am a parent.
- A real parent.

1066
01:18:25,867 --> 01:18:27,785
What's that mean?

1067
01:18:30,205 --> 01:18:32,873
Take your bath.
Your father's done.

1068
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:35,918
And take the prince with you.

1069
01:18:37,003 --> 01:18:38,170
The prince?

1070
01:18:38,296 --> 01:18:41,215
You should.
We have a nice big bath.

1071
01:18:41,341 --> 01:18:43,092
Yukari-san.

1072
01:18:45,137 --> 01:18:47,346
We usually take separate baths.

1073
01:18:47,472 --> 01:18:51,600
On a day like today,
he should let his son bathe first.

1074
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:54,687
Ηe just spaces out all day.

1075
01:18:54,813 --> 01:18:57,273
There's no need
to bathe every day.

1076
01:18:57,399 --> 01:18:59,608
lt's a waste
of precious hot water.

1077
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:01,235
What is it, Mother?

1078
01:19:01,361 --> 01:19:03,904
Let Atsushi bathe first,
with Ryota.

1079
01:19:04,072 --> 01:19:05,573
Sure.

1080
01:19:05,699 --> 01:19:07,241
Usually we don't.

1081
01:19:07,409 --> 01:19:09,618
l'll leave your pajamas out.

1082
01:19:09,745 --> 01:19:11,328
l brought a T-shirt.

1083
01:19:11,455 --> 01:19:13,622
Wear them.
l bought them for you.

1084
01:19:13,749 --> 01:19:15,416
Where?

1085
01:19:16,209 --> 01:19:19,253
A discount shop, l bet.
Let's see.

1086
01:19:19,379 --> 01:19:21,714
- l'll show you.
- Let's see.

1087
01:19:22,007 --> 01:19:25,634
- You like this color.
- Oh no.

1088
01:19:26,094 --> 01:19:29,346
Atsushi, let's take a bath.

1089
01:19:29,598 --> 01:19:32,266
Wait till l finish this part.

1090
01:19:40,233 --> 01:19:42,526
The bathtub's really narrow.

1091
01:19:43,028 --> 01:19:44,987
l don't think we'll both fit.

1092
01:19:48,283 --> 01:19:49,784
Ηere.

1093
01:19:55,832 --> 01:19:57,583
What about my T-shirt?

1094
01:19:57,709 --> 01:20:01,295
You've got
your mother's pajamas, right?

1095
01:20:01,588 --> 01:20:03,422
l don't need to wear those.

1096
01:20:03,548 --> 01:20:05,007
You should.

1097
01:20:05,133 --> 01:20:07,927
She took the trouble
to buy them for you.

1098
01:20:09,930 --> 01:20:11,931
Are you mad?

1099
01:20:13,058 --> 01:20:15,476
She's like this when l visit.

1100
01:20:15,977 --> 01:20:18,229
She just wants to look after me.

1101
01:20:18,355 --> 01:20:21,232
- lt's not about that.
- What, then?

1102
01:20:23,610 --> 01:20:28,489
lf she's going to buy pajamas,
she could buy a set for Atsushi too.

1103
01:20:30,325 --> 01:20:34,495
She treated him all day long
like a guest, not family.

1104
01:20:36,456 --> 01:20:40,417
You're projecting.
She just didn't get around to it.

1105
01:20:41,461 --> 01:20:44,338
She had three toothbrushes
set out.

1106
01:20:46,466 --> 01:20:48,968
Ηand me my T-shirt.

1107
01:20:55,392 --> 01:20:57,142
Yukari-san.

1108
01:21:07,112 --> 01:21:10,030
Yukari-san, come.

1109
01:21:26,172 --> 01:21:27,882
Use this.

1110
01:21:58,163 --> 01:22:00,623
Job not going well?

1111
01:22:00,874 --> 01:22:03,292
lt's fine. Why?

1112
01:22:03,710 --> 01:22:06,086
Forget it, then.

1113
01:22:07,422 --> 01:22:10,299
Don't worry about me.
Things have changed.

1114
01:22:13,845 --> 01:22:15,679
Can't you...

1115
01:22:16,014 --> 01:22:20,267
call your mom once in a while?
Let her hear your voice.

1116
01:22:21,144 --> 01:22:24,480
When l do,
all she ever does is complain.

1117
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:26,857
Be patient and hear her out.

1118
01:22:27,067 --> 01:22:28,943
That's not my job.

1119
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:34,740
Can't the two of you work things out
without dragging me into it?

1120
01:22:37,577 --> 01:22:39,078
Whatever.

1121
01:22:39,204 --> 01:22:42,414
But that line about the corn -
l said it, not Junpei.

1122
01:22:43,208 --> 01:22:44,667
Oh yeah?

1123
01:22:44,793 --> 01:22:46,502
Yeah.

1124
01:22:47,128 --> 01:22:49,463
What difference does it make?

1125
01:22:51,758 --> 01:22:54,176
Ryo, it's too hot to get in.

1126
01:22:54,302 --> 01:22:56,136
l'll be right there.

1127
01:22:57,222 --> 01:23:00,265
Not that it matters anymore.

1128
01:23:12,737 --> 01:23:14,071
Damn.

1129
01:23:57,907 --> 01:23:59,908
Do you have a splinter?

1130
01:24:00,452 --> 01:24:04,872
lf you can pinch a mole like this,
you'll be rich.

1131
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:07,541
Grandma?

1132
01:24:11,921 --> 01:24:14,339
See this?

1133
01:24:15,216 --> 01:24:20,304
Grandma told me,
so l always tried hard to pinch it.

1134
01:24:22,223 --> 01:24:24,224
Not that it did much good.

1135
01:24:30,648 --> 01:24:34,359
Why did you want
to be a doctor, Ryo?

1136
01:24:40,909 --> 01:24:42,618
lt was long ago.

1137
01:24:43,953 --> 01:24:45,788
Long, long ago.

1138
01:24:52,545 --> 01:24:54,838
ls it this one?

1139
01:24:56,299 --> 01:24:58,342
Oh, here it is.

1140
01:24:58,593 --> 01:25:00,469
l'll give you this too.

1141
01:25:02,055 --> 01:25:04,765
Oh no, Mother.
lt's too expensive.

1142
01:25:04,891 --> 01:25:09,228
Oh no, it's not expensive,
but it's a fine kimono.

1143
01:25:09,646 --> 01:25:12,856
My daughter wants everything,

1144
01:25:13,108 --> 01:25:15,109
but once she gets it,
she ignores it.

1145
01:25:15,276 --> 01:25:19,238
l gave her a beautiful kimono,
but she's never worn it once.

1146
01:25:20,448 --> 01:25:24,451
l wonder if she's sold it
on the "lnter-something"

1147
01:25:24,619 --> 01:25:26,578
for cold, hard cash.

1148
01:25:26,704 --> 01:25:30,791
- l doubt that.
- l wouldn't put it past her.

1149
01:25:32,210 --> 01:25:35,170
You get dimples
when you laugh.

1150
01:25:38,007 --> 01:25:39,675
lt's so sweet.

1151
01:25:41,136 --> 01:25:43,971
What's the point
of dimples at my age?

1152
01:25:44,722 --> 01:25:46,431
That's not true.

1153
01:25:46,724 --> 01:25:49,726
A woman should be charming
at any age.

1154
01:25:50,145 --> 01:25:51,937
l'm jealous.

1155
01:25:52,397 --> 01:25:54,565
Don't be.

1156
01:25:57,193 --> 01:25:59,820
Are you all right?
You're flushed.

1157
01:26:00,697 --> 01:26:02,906
Because l drank a little tonight.

1158
01:26:03,032 --> 01:26:05,909
Oh, when l was young,

1159
01:26:06,452 --> 01:26:11,331
they said, "A woman should
never empty a glass of beer."

1160
01:26:12,417 --> 01:26:14,835
You young folks are lucky.

1161
01:26:15,587 --> 01:26:19,047
These days,
l rarely drink when l'm out.

1162
01:26:19,174 --> 01:26:21,049
So you drink at home?

1163
01:26:21,176 --> 01:26:23,760
lt must be boring.
My son doesn't drink.

1164
01:26:23,928 --> 01:26:26,221
Well, these days

1165
01:26:26,347 --> 01:26:29,016
Ryota often drinks
beer at home.

1166
01:26:29,184 --> 01:26:31,185
Oh really?

1167
01:26:31,436 --> 01:26:35,689
Just a little.
Says it helps him sleep.

1168
01:26:37,275 --> 01:26:40,861
l didn't know.

1169
01:26:43,823 --> 01:26:46,825
Better dry your hair.
You'll catch cold.

1170
01:26:47,702 --> 01:26:50,245
I weigh Iess than before.

1171
01:26:54,834 --> 01:26:58,420
What are you two
going to do about a baby?

1172
01:27:02,592 --> 01:27:06,720
We'll probably take some time
to think about it.

1173
01:27:06,846 --> 01:27:08,764
Guess you're right.

1174
01:27:08,890 --> 01:27:13,268
But if you're going to have one,
you shouldn't wait.

1175
01:27:14,270 --> 01:27:15,896
You're right.

1176
01:27:16,731 --> 01:27:20,692
You have to think
about Atsushi too.

1177
01:27:21,402 --> 01:27:26,240
You'd hate to have things
get awkward with a new baby.

1178
01:27:27,992 --> 01:27:31,078
Maybe it's best that you don't.

1179
01:27:31,287 --> 01:27:33,330
What a shame.

1180
01:27:36,084 --> 01:27:38,669
l wonder if this sash will match.

1181
01:27:39,003 --> 01:27:41,338
Maybe it's too plain.

1182
01:28:03,194 --> 01:28:05,821
This looks normal... right?

1183
01:28:08,866 --> 01:28:10,450
Right?

1184
01:28:26,009 --> 01:28:27,551
What?

1185
01:28:27,677 --> 01:28:29,511
It just fIew in.

1186
01:28:34,309 --> 01:28:37,644
You followed us home
from his grave, right?

1187
01:28:48,656 --> 01:28:52,743
Keep it closed.
lt might be Junpei.

1188
01:28:54,829 --> 01:28:56,705
Ηey, Mom...

1189
01:28:58,875 --> 01:29:04,671
Junpei?

1190
01:29:05,506 --> 01:29:07,549
Ηurry, get it outside.

1191
01:29:10,011 --> 01:29:12,429
Cut it out.
You're pathetic.

1192
01:29:13,014 --> 01:29:15,223
- Calm down.
- But -

1193
01:29:19,854 --> 01:29:23,023
See, it is Junpei.

1194
01:29:23,191 --> 01:29:24,941
Ridiculous!

1195
01:29:30,114 --> 01:29:31,907
Junpei.

1196
01:29:40,875 --> 01:29:43,377
Gently now, gently.

1197
01:29:48,508 --> 01:29:51,885
lt's a butterfly.
Just a butterfly.

1198
01:29:53,096 --> 01:29:56,139
Right.
Just a butterfly.

1199
01:30:02,271 --> 01:30:04,147
l'm letting it go.

1200
01:30:22,583 --> 01:30:26,211
On my grandma's
1 7th memorial,

1201
01:30:26,337 --> 01:30:29,297
a butterfly flew in at night.

1202
01:30:34,137 --> 01:30:36,263
You should take your bath, Mom.

1203
01:30:39,434 --> 01:30:41,143
l guess l will.

1204
01:31:00,663 --> 01:31:02,664
Yokoyama residence.

1205
01:31:07,336 --> 01:31:09,713
Oh, l see.
Please wait a minute.

1206
01:31:10,131 --> 01:31:12,299
The lady across the way
feels sick.

1207
01:31:19,307 --> 01:31:20,891
l'll take it.

1208
01:31:21,809 --> 01:31:24,144
Ηer heart again?

1209
01:31:24,312 --> 01:31:27,147
She's supposed
to be taking her digitalis.

1210
01:31:40,203 --> 01:31:43,330
Okay.
Call an ambulance, then.

1211
01:31:43,998 --> 01:31:45,957
l can't.

1212
01:31:46,792 --> 01:31:50,337
l'd like to, but -

1213
01:31:52,632 --> 01:31:55,509
l'm sorry
l can't be of more help.

1214
01:32:08,022 --> 01:32:11,316
- Slowly now.
- It'II sway a IittIe.

1215
01:32:11,442 --> 01:32:13,818
We'II stop here
and turn around.

1216
01:32:16,030 --> 01:32:18,365
What's her pulse?

1217
01:32:18,491 --> 01:32:20,158
Please get back.

1218
01:32:22,036 --> 01:32:24,079
Let's open up
and Ioad her in.

1219
01:32:24,205 --> 01:32:26,915
You don't understand. l'm -

1220
01:32:30,253 --> 01:32:31,586
You'II be fine.

1221
01:32:32,588 --> 01:32:35,257
Excuse me. Get back.

1222
01:33:09,542 --> 01:33:11,209
Time to go to bed.

1223
01:33:17,216 --> 01:33:20,594
Don't walk around
in those pathetic pajamas.

1224
01:34:03,012 --> 01:34:06,473
Ηe said he'd fix the tiles,

1225
01:34:07,308 --> 01:34:11,311
but he ate his fill,
took a nap, and went home.

1226
01:34:14,982 --> 01:34:18,485
He's always like that.
All talk and no action.

1227
01:34:59,819 --> 01:35:02,654
Grandma was acting
strange earlier.

1228
01:35:04,532 --> 01:35:07,784
lt just seemed that way to her.

1229
01:35:10,705 --> 01:35:12,664
Even though he's gone?

1230
01:35:15,251 --> 01:35:17,043
Even when they die...

1231
01:35:18,045 --> 01:35:20,380
people don't really go away.

1232
01:35:32,268 --> 01:35:35,895
Your father's here.
Right inside you.

1233
01:35:37,523 --> 01:35:40,024
Ηalf of you is made
of your father.

1234
01:35:40,443 --> 01:35:43,153
Ηalf of you is from me.

1235
01:35:44,989 --> 01:35:46,865
What about Ryo, then?

1236
01:35:52,079 --> 01:35:56,332
Ryo will become
a part of you too.

1237
01:35:57,084 --> 01:35:58,835
Slowly but surely.

1238
01:35:59,503 --> 01:36:01,087
Slowly but surely?

1239
01:36:08,471 --> 01:36:09,971
What?

1240
01:36:10,598 --> 01:36:12,599
Slowly but surely what?

1241
01:36:13,309 --> 01:36:16,811
What do you say?
Do you want to let Ryo in?

1242
01:36:18,481 --> 01:36:21,191
Ηey, let me in.

1243
01:36:22,318 --> 01:36:24,235
Ηow will he get in?

1244
01:36:25,112 --> 01:36:26,946
Through your mouth?

1245
01:36:27,740 --> 01:36:30,617
What through the mouth?

1246
01:36:31,786 --> 01:36:33,828
Through your belly button?

1247
01:36:34,538 --> 01:36:35,955
Belly button?

1248
01:36:37,541 --> 01:36:39,542
My belly button,
slowly but surely?

1249
01:37:38,561 --> 01:37:42,856
l became one
of the relay runners

1250
01:37:43,858 --> 01:37:46,359
in the fall track meet.

1251
01:37:49,613 --> 01:37:52,490
l saw a yellow butterfly today.

1252
01:37:54,201 --> 01:37:59,497
Just like the one l caught
with you in Karuizawa, Dad.

1253
01:38:03,335 --> 01:38:06,296
When l grow up...

1254
01:38:07,089 --> 01:38:11,467
l want to be a piano tuner
just like you, Dad.

1255
01:38:13,387 --> 01:38:17,056
lf that's impossible,
l'd like to be a doctor.

1256
01:39:37,721 --> 01:39:39,597
l'm off.

1257
01:39:40,265 --> 01:39:42,266
Please look after him, Father.

1258
01:39:49,149 --> 01:39:50,900
Off you go.

1259
01:39:51,819 --> 01:39:54,654
Sorry there's leftover fish.

1260
01:40:01,495 --> 01:40:04,789
Be careful.
Don't go in the water.

1261
01:40:05,499 --> 01:40:07,000
Okay.

1262
01:40:24,184 --> 01:40:26,686
- The beach?
- Yeah, let's go.

1263
01:42:31,645 --> 01:42:34,355
- Don't fall.
- l'm fine.

1264
01:43:29,703 --> 01:43:32,955
What about
the Bay Stars baseball team?

1265
01:43:35,876 --> 01:43:37,543
These days...

1266
01:43:39,213 --> 01:43:41,214
l follow the Marinos.

1267
01:43:42,216 --> 01:43:44,967
You, into soccer?

1268
01:43:46,053 --> 01:43:48,387
l catch games
at the Yokohama stadium.

1269
01:43:49,681 --> 01:43:51,766
Uh... who with?

1270
01:43:54,561 --> 01:43:56,395
Oh, who cares?

1271
01:43:56,605 --> 01:44:00,316
We should go, with the kid.

1272
01:44:02,236 --> 01:44:03,903
We should.

1273
01:44:05,072 --> 01:44:06,906
One of these days.

1274
01:44:16,083 --> 01:44:18,084
That ship ran aground.

1275
01:44:33,433 --> 01:44:35,434
Go see a dentist.

1276
01:44:35,978 --> 01:44:39,230
- One of these days.
- Don't keep putting it off.

1277
01:44:39,356 --> 01:44:43,526
A single cavity
can ruin your teeth.

1278
01:44:43,652 --> 01:44:44,694
Okay.

1279
01:44:44,820 --> 01:44:47,238
lt's too late
if you have to pull them.

1280
01:44:47,364 --> 01:44:49,240
Okay, okay, okay.

1281
01:44:50,659 --> 01:44:53,577
And take your weekends off.

1282
01:44:53,704 --> 01:44:55,955
You're getting older.

1283
01:44:56,206 --> 01:44:58,958
Yesterday you said
l was still young.

1284
01:44:59,084 --> 01:45:00,459
Ηere it is.

1285
01:45:00,585 --> 01:45:03,379
l'm sure l still had
something left to say.

1286
01:45:04,631 --> 01:45:06,799
Come visit again soon.

1287
01:45:09,803 --> 01:45:12,221
Please teach me
that sauteed radish recipe.

1288
01:45:12,347 --> 01:45:14,432
l'd be happy to.

1289
01:45:14,558 --> 01:45:16,100
That's all right.

1290
01:45:16,351 --> 01:45:19,312
- Shaking hands?
- Oh, who cares?

1291
01:45:19,479 --> 01:45:22,440
- Bye, Father.
- See you.

1292
01:45:22,566 --> 01:45:23,983
Good-bye.

1293
01:45:24,109 --> 01:45:26,319
You've got good manners.

1294
01:45:29,156 --> 01:45:31,157
Well, we'll be seeing you.

1295
01:46:12,032 --> 01:46:15,368
They'll be back for New Year's.

1296
01:46:28,382 --> 01:46:32,676
We can pass on New Year's now.
Once a year is plenty.

1297
01:46:33,970 --> 01:46:38,224
Can't have them treating us too much.
Next time we won't spend the night.

1298
01:46:38,392 --> 01:46:40,017
l told you so.

1299
01:46:40,143 --> 01:46:43,312
We should've left
yesterday before dinner.

1300
01:46:43,438 --> 01:46:47,149
l ate too much.
l put on two pounds.

1301
01:46:47,526 --> 01:46:49,485
Seven more stops.

1302
01:46:52,656 --> 01:46:56,033
l just remembered
the name of that sumo wrestler.

1303
01:46:57,244 --> 01:46:59,078
lt's Kurohime-yama.

1304
01:47:03,917 --> 01:47:08,170
lt's always like that.
l'm always a little late.

1305
01:47:26,773 --> 01:47:29,400
Don't do that stuff.

1306
01:47:30,569 --> 01:47:32,111
Don't do what?

1307
01:47:33,280 --> 01:47:37,950
Shaking their hands.
They'll get the wrong idea.

1308
01:47:38,118 --> 01:47:41,287
lf a handshake gives them
the wrong idea,

1309
01:47:41,455 --> 01:47:43,747
l'm perfectly happy to do it.

1310
01:47:48,628 --> 01:47:50,129
Oh, l remember.

1311
01:47:53,467 --> 01:47:57,011
- What?
- The name of that sumo wrestler.

1312
01:47:57,637 --> 01:48:00,139
- Who?
- Doesn't matter.

1313
01:48:00,307 --> 01:48:01,640
Who is it?

1314
01:48:01,766 --> 01:48:05,811
lt doesn't matter anyway.

1315
01:48:11,902 --> 01:48:14,695
We never brought up
that sumo wrestler again.

1316
01:48:16,907 --> 01:48:20,451
Three years Iater, Dad died.

1317
01:48:22,078 --> 01:48:25,706
l never did get
to a soccer match with him.

1318
01:48:28,335 --> 01:48:30,836
Mom bickered with Dad
untiI the day he died,

1319
01:48:31,463 --> 01:48:33,923
but she died soon after him.

1320
01:48:35,884 --> 01:48:39,720
l never did give her
a ride in a car.

1321
01:49:18,134 --> 01:49:20,511
lt's so hot.
The water must feel good.

1322
01:49:25,100 --> 01:49:26,559
Look, Mommy.

1323
01:49:26,726 --> 01:49:30,104
Very pretty.
Put them in here.

1324
01:49:40,448 --> 01:49:42,199
Let's pray, then.

1325
01:49:55,714 --> 01:49:59,216
Look - ants.
Watch your step now.

1326
01:50:05,432 --> 01:50:08,392
Look, a butterfly.

1327
01:50:10,770 --> 01:50:13,022
They say
yellow butterflies like that

1328
01:50:13,148 --> 01:50:18,068
are white ones that survive the winter
and come back yellow the next year.

1329
01:50:18,194 --> 01:50:20,404
Really?

1330
01:50:20,822 --> 01:50:22,823
Who told you?

1331
01:50:23,825 --> 01:50:26,243
