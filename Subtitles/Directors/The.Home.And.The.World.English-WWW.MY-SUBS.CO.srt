by Satyajit Ray

29
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:14,391
<i>I have passed through fire.</i>

30
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:19,527
<i>What was impure in me</i>

31
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:24,094
<i>has been burned to ashes.</i>

32
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:30,041
<i>What remains, I dedicate to him,</i>

33
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:36,871
<i>to the man who accepted aII my faiIings</i>
<i>in the depths of his stricken heart.</i>

34
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:41,686
<i>Now I know there is no one eIse Iike him.</i>

35
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:49,290
<i>It was 1 0 years ago when I first met him.</i>

36
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:56,061
<i>He was the son of a nobIe famiIy,</i>
<i>and I was his bride.</i>

37
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:06,208
<i>I heard that my husband</i>
<i>was of a gentIe disposition.</i>

38
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:10,109
<i>I considered myseIf fortunate.</i>
<i>Not every bride is so Iucky.</i>

39
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:15,276
<i>When I joined the famiIy, my sister-in-Iaw</i>
<i>was aIready a widow, wearing white.</i>

40
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:18,415
<i>Though it was never mentioned,</i>

41
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:23,257
<i>I couId see that she had never enjoyed</i>
<i>the pIeasures of a happy maritaI Iife.</i>

42
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:42,878
<i>Our rooms were in the inner</i>
<i>apartments of the paIace.</i>

43
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:48,184
<i>A passage with stained-gIass windows</i>
<i>Ied to the outer apartments.</i>

44
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:52,283
<i>The door of this passage</i>
<i>aIways remained cIosed to us.</i>

45
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:55,159
<i>I didn't mind the confinement,</i>

46
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:59,489
<i>because I was raised</i>
<i>to foIIow traditionaI vaIues.</i>

47
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:03,057
<i>But my husband had modern views.</i>

48
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:08,333
<i>He was the first in his famiIy</i>
<i>to receive a Western education.</i>

49
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:14,342
<i>He appointed Miss GiIby</i>
<i>to make a</i> memsahib <i>out of me.</i>

50
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:56,273
Why did you have to come here?

51
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:08,013
<i>Soon even the cIothes I wore</i>
<i>began to refIect Miss GiIby's infIuence.</i>

52
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:27,127
English clothes, English songs.

53
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,832
Soon we won't even seem related.

54
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:31,341
-- You still haven't told me how l look.
-- Very nice.

55
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:34,769
Pretty as a picture.

56
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:39,016
You're a lucky one.

57
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:41,951
You should grab
your good fortune with both hands.

58
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:48,291
Few brides have known
happiness in this family.

59
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:54,588
Some barely knew their husbands' faces,
let alone the face of happiness.

60
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:59,365
l used to wait up for him all night,

61
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:01,440
hoping he'd come to me.

62
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:09,247
For two whole days before he died,
l stayed by his bedside.

63
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:15,916
He was almost unconscious,
dazed with fever.

64
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:18,685
He was burning hot.

65
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:23,323
Suddenly, he opened his eyes and said,

66
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,990
''Who are you?''

67
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:34,797
He didn't even recognize his own wife.

68
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:42,641
l wonder if you realize
how lucky you are.

69
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:45,016
Why wouldn't l?

70
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,281
Don't l know my own --

71
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:52,656
Look who's here.
We were just talking about you.

72
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,282
Really?

73
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:59,263
l thought only little girls
played with dolls.

74
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:01,856
Now l see even grown men do.

75
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:04,903
-- What do you mean?
-- She's dolling herself up for you.

76
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:08,167
Can't you see?
-- l see.

77
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,834
She's going to make
your dreams come true.

78
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:15,547
Well, men must have
their little fantasies.

79
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:18,073
lsn't that true, sister--in--law?

80
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:21,548
Enjoy them.

81
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,790
l'll look on from the wings.

82
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:30,555
From the wings? Why?

83
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:32,426
What's the harm in staying here?

84
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:35,326
lt's better that way.

85
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:39,094
ln my day, we used attar.

86
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:45,772
These foreign perfumes
make me feel sick.

87
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:48,938
l'll be going now.

88
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,860
Are these clothes all new?

89
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:09,764
The tailor brought them today.

90
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:11,894
They're all my own design.

91
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:15,164
l can see that.

92
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:19,004
You dress up so beautifully for me.

93
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:23,079
ls it right that l should be
the only man to admire you?

94
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:26,345
You think l would dress up
for any other man?

95
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:29,251
Why any other man?

96
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:33,149
l'm just thinking of the ones
l've sung your praises to.

97
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:35,784
You think they're dying
to catch a glimpse of me?

98
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,997
-- You know something?
-- What?

99
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:46,999
ln the past, confining women
to the house wasn't a Hindu custom.

100
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:50,667
Sita, Sabitri, Draupadi...

101
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:53,208
None of them were confined.

102
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:56,440
So what?
Your Bimala is happy here.

103
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:03,886
Did you know that women used
to choose their own husbands?

104
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,353
Have you heard of that?

105
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:10,584
Why are you laughing?

106
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:15,296
lf l'd had a choice,
l might not have chosen you.

107
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,629
l know.

108
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:19,296
But you didn't have a choice.

109
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,997
How sad.

110
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:24,042
l'm envious...

111
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,441
of Draupadi...

112
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:28,445
and her five husbands.

113
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:35,446
All your life, you've only
set eyes on one man.

114
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:39,456
How can you know
what kind of man he is

115
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:41,924
if you can't compare him with others?

116
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:45,929
You aren't trying to bring back
the classical age, are you?

117
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:47,089
What for?

118
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:51,398
Still, l see no logic in confining women.

119
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:55,664
l think the Muslims introduced the custom.

120
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:59,771
Hindus never cared about it.

121
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:03,641
Do you think people will reject
this custom just because you say so?

122
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:08,015
lt's not the people
l'm thinking of, Bimala.

123
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:12,213
You know l'm not like other people.

124
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:17,622
l don't think tradition
should be followed blindly.

125
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:35,375
l would be really proud

126
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:38,079
if l could persuade you
to meet my friends.

127
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:42,511
You mean him?

128
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:50,555
Sandip is a genius.

129
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:55,856
l have no intention of meeting someone
who's constantly asking you for money

130
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:58,528
on one pretext or another.

131
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:02,403
Sandip is working
for the good of our nation.

132
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:05,373
He's gifted, but has no money.

133
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:10,441
lf my money contributes to his good deeds,
that's to my advantage.

134
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:13,484
For the good of our nation?
What does he do?

135
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:14,780
The Swadeshi movement.

136
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:18,288
Do you know about it?
-- Of course.

137
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:21,325
They often talk about it these days.

138
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:25,058
Boycott foreign goods.

139
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:27,291
Buy only lndian goods.

140
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:30,266
Don't buy foreign salt or sugar.
Buy our own.

141
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,738
You know so much.

142
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:36,801
l read the newspaper.

143
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:41,443
-- Do you know why?
-- l do.

144
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:42,707
Tell me.

145
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:45,910
Come. Sit down here and tell me.

146
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:55,555
Yes, master.

147
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:58,460
Tell me what's behind
the Swadeshi movement.

148
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:02,326
The governor--general
has split Bengal in two.

149
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:05,232
Hindus and Muslims
used to live together in peace,

150
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:08,306
but he's driven a wedge between them.

151
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:16,542
You seem to forget
that your wife is educated.

152
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:19,749
l speak English.
Why wouldn't l know all this?

153
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:29,586
Sandip is a leader
of the Swadeshi movement.

154
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:37,191
lsn't their mantra, ''Hail Motherland''?

155
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,296
Yes.

156
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:49,870
This mantra has set
the whole nation on fire.

157
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:52,709
Except for one person.

158
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:55,378
lt hasn't set him on fire.

159
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,886
lt takes a lot to set me on fire, Bimala.

160
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:07,956
Although...

161
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:12,661
l certainly don't approve
of Lord Curzon's decision.

162
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:17,035
Turning Hindus and Muslims
against each other...

163
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:20,077
l think it's criminal.

164
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:22,704
Don't the Swadeshi burn foreign clothes?

165
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,443
Yes, they do.

166
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:28,044
lf they got hold of your sari,
they'd burn it.

167
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,246
-- Really?
-- Yes.

168
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:33,154
Do you know where
this thread comes from?

169
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:34,520
Where?

170
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:38,295
-- Really?
-- Yes.

171
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:41,525
Most of the articles
on your dressing table are imported.

172
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:44,563
This brush is an import,

173
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,969
the mirror, the comb.

174
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:51,440
Your hairpins are imported.

175
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:55,609
These perfumes are French.

176
00:16:56,548 --> 00:17:00,382
Even these bottles
are imported cut glass.

177
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,217
The table's foreign too.

178
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:10,523
Most of the furniture in here
comes from Lazarus.

179
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,564
lt's a foreign company.

180
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:18,469
Really?

181
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:20,896
We never even gave it a thought.

182
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,799
What do you think we should do?

183
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,504
Why not ask Sandip?

184
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,274
He's coming here.

185
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,676
-- Really?
-- Yes.

186
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:33,979
-- When?
-- Shortly.

187
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:36,313
He'll be my guest.

188
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:38,413
He's holding a meeting
in our courtyard.

189
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:47,059
l think you'll enjoy meeting him.

190
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,368
Why?

191
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:55,567
Something about him appeals to women.

192
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:02,006
He's had quite a few affairs.

193
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:05,942
And not all the women
believed in Swadeshi.

194
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:08,248
But he's not married, is he?

195
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:13,023
He says he has no time for it.

196
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:17,627
Married life doesn't suit him.

197
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:20,863
He has a restless nature,

198
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:22,759
unlike me.

199
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,134
Why would l enjoy
meeting your opposite?

200
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:30,468
You may not enjoy it...

201
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,001
but you may find it instructive.

202
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,107
l'm happy in my confinement.

203
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:39,116
l have no wish to be like Sita or Sabitri.

204
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:44,882
<i>I was unprepared for what</i>
<i>foIIowed in the next few days.</i>

205
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,163
<i>I was shocked by Miss GiIby's story.</i>

206
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:36,339
<i>It was a Sunday,</i>
<i>so she had gone to church.</i>

207
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:37,738
<i>On her way back,</i>

208
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:43,110
<i>a IocaI schooIboy hit her</i>
<i>on the head with a stone.</i>

209
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:45,706
<i>It seemed to be</i>
<i>the infIuence of the Swadeshi.</i>

210
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:49,753
<i>The peopIe began to feeI</i>
<i>so much hatred towards the British</i>

211
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:54,883
<i>that Iife became dangerous even</i>
<i>for innocent peopIe Iike Miss GiIby.</i>

212
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:59,458
<i>I was toId I couId no Ionger</i>
<i>become a</i> memsahib.

213
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:06,795
<i>Miss GiIby Ieft.</i>

214
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:13,043
<i>A few days Iater,</i>
<i>the Swadeshi arrived.</i>

215
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,613
Hail Motherland!

216
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,705
Hail Motherland!

217
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:20,007
Over there.

218
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:22,586
Do you see him?
-- Where?

219
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:24,280
Those boys are carrying him
on their shoulders.

220
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:27,255
Hail Motherland!

221
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:55,417
Friends...

222
00:20:56,288 --> 00:21:02,352
you all know why
we're assembled here tonight.

223
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:05,556
For the past few days,

224
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:10,324
Bengal has been facing
a serious crisis.

225
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:15,935
Lord Curzon, the governor of lndia,
with one strike of his diplomatic sword,

226
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:19,369
has severed our golden Bengal in two.

227
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:22,242
ln East and West Bengal,

228
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:24,611
our two religious groups

229
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:33,021
have been united by a spirit
of solidarity, friendship and fraternity,

230
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:40,554
and this solidarity has become a source
of grave concern for our rulers.

231
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:45,266
The partition has cut
at the very roots of this solidarity.

232
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:50,472
Now we all understand
what the policy of our rulers is:

233
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:52,566
''Divide and rule.''

234
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:56,307
They wish to create a rift between
our two religious communities

235
00:21:56,415 --> 00:22:00,078
and thereby strengthen
their own position.

236
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:02,483
The power of our English rulers

237
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:04,578
is matched only by their arrogance.

238
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:11,391
The political leaders of Bengal
have risen as one against the partition,

239
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:14,056
but our rulers have paid no heed to them.

240
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:17,933
We lacked the means to prevent
our rulers from fulfilling their plans,

241
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:23,702
but they failed to realize that
we can fight politics with politics.

242
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:29,111
The strategy we have adopted
will not only confound our rulers,

243
00:22:29,214 --> 00:22:31,512
but it will also ultimately
benefit our nation

244
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:35,643
and bring prosperity
and independence to our people.

245
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:38,450
This is how Swadeshi works.

246
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:41,852
l call upon all of you,

247
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,951
men and women,

248
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:45,893
rich and poor,

249
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:48,090
rulers and subjects,

250
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,864
to take a solemn vow

251
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:57,032
to reject and boycott all foreign goods
from this moment on

252
00:22:57,142 --> 00:23:01,044
and accept only lndian goods.

253
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:06,978
Until now our rulers
have blocked all our attempts

254
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:09,076
to develop our own resources.

255
00:23:09,187 --> 00:23:11,052
We have been forced
to buy their foreign cloth,

256
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:15,388
their foreign salt
and their foreign sugar.

257
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:17,860
Have you ever considered

258
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:21,262
how many everyday items
are being made here?

259
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:26,165
l don't know if you've seen
the big foreign stores in Calcutta.

260
00:23:26,271 --> 00:23:27,397
l have.

261
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:32,876
They enjoy staggering prosperity
and a profusion of goods.

262
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:35,208
Don't we have the right to ask

263
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:39,716
why our wealth should fill
the coffers of our foreign rulers?

264
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:42,150
Who gave them the right
to exploit us like this?

265
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:45,249
ls this not at the root
of our nation's poverty?

266
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:48,758
ls it not our duty to put
an end to this extortion?

267
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:52,762
Has not the time come
to abolish this shame?

268
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:56,197
lf we remain indifferent to these crimes,
if we do nothing,

269
00:23:56,301 --> 00:24:00,203
if these foreigners continue
to steal away all our nation's wealth,

270
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:03,331
what kind of future
can we expect for our country?

271
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,410
So l say to you, my brothers,

272
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:09,640
the time has come to rise up against
the arrogance of the English government.

273
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:11,613
We must not hesitate any longer.

274
00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:15,618
Let us all take the Swadeshi oath.

275
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:20,089
And the great cry from the heart
that will launch us on this task,

276
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:24,629
the sacred mantra that
will rock the throne of our rulers,

277
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:27,960
let us all chant that mantra,

278
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:30,557
and, braving all peril,

279
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:35,072
dedicate ourselves
to the service of the Motherland.

280
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:38,540
Hail Motherland!
-- Hail Motherland!

281
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:09,433
Still singing English songs after
that impassioned nationalistic speech?

282
00:25:10,876 --> 00:25:12,104
What should l sing, then?

283
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:19,279
Kirtan, Shyama Sangeet,
Nidhu Babu's tappa.

284
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:31,855
<i>GentIy she waIks,</i>
<i>the beauteous one</i>

285
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:37,424
<i>GentIy she waIks,</i>
<i>the beauteous one</i>

286
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:43,133
<i>Radiant as the moon,</i>
<i>the beauteous one</i>

287
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:49,805
l must say, he is a good speaker.

288
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:51,849
He knows how to turn a phrase.

289
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:54,510
He was good at debate in college.

290
00:25:55,253 --> 00:26:01,590
<i>Her smiIe sends rippIes of deIight</i>

291
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:05,086
All those boys wearing saffron
were a pretty sight.

292
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:15,269
<i>That make the Iove god swoon</i>

293
00:26:19,844 --> 00:26:21,573
How long is he staying?

294
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:24,946
He's going to Rangpur tomorrow.

295
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:29,311
He has some business there.

296
00:26:31,122 --> 00:26:33,056
Do you want to meet him?

297
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:37,553
l have nothing to say.
What's the point?

298
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:41,064
You don't have to say anything.

299
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:43,191
He'll do all the talking.

300
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,400
What if he asks me about Swadeshi?

301
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:19,630
Then answer him.

302
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:24,433
He certainly made sense.

303
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:28,112
Tell him so.

304
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:32,574
l'm sure he'll be shocked
if l wear one of my fancy dresses.

305
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:38,149
What do you think l should wear?

306
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:55,530
<i>On November 1 5, 1 907,</i>

307
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:58,804
<i>the young mistress of the Choudhury house</i>
<i>defied aII convention</i>

308
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:01,572
<i>and stepped into the passage</i>
<i>Ieading to the outer apartments.</i>

309
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,277
Greetings.

310
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:16,978
Your speech has inspired my wife
to take up the Swadeshi cause.

311
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:21,915
-- You must be joking, Nikhil.
-- No, it's true.

312
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:24,895
Come.

313
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,121
Have a seat.

314
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:30,494
Have a seat, Sandip.

315
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:35,568
What's the matter with you?
Have a seat.

316
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:50,182
At first, l couldn't believe my eyes.

317
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:53,547
Now, l can't believe my ears.

318
00:29:54,592 --> 00:29:56,617
My husband is exaggerating a bit.

319
00:29:57,595 --> 00:30:01,759
Even if only a fraction of what he said
is true, l'll be more than happy.

320
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:05,361
No matter what l may
accomplish as a politician,

321
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:08,803
you have already achieved
a social revolution.

322
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:11,604
l know how important that is.

323
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,307
l also realize that,

324
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:15,971
although Nikhil's your husband,

325
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:18,949
you're not his mere shadow.

326
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:20,881
You have a mind of your own.

327
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:26,483
Nikhil doesn't take my words
to heart, but you did.

328
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:29,685
lf you keep on like that,
she'll be walking on air.

329
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:32,422
lt's no use telling me that.

330
00:30:32,797 --> 00:30:37,257
As a politician, l'm utterly shameless
about seeking support for my cause.

331
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:41,903
l have never succeeded
in persuading a woman,

332
00:30:42,473 --> 00:30:45,169
but should that ever happen,
l'd be delighted.

333
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:49,244
lt would be an honor
to have a woman in our ranks.

334
00:30:50,982 --> 00:30:56,113
Women have a rare quality

335
00:30:56,788 --> 00:30:58,756
which we call intuition.

336
00:30:59,757 --> 00:31:02,123
l admire it greatly.

337
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:06,221
Man's ability to reason
pales beside it.

338
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:09,227
What do you say, Nikhil?

339
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:14,998
Why don't you tell him
what you thought of his speech?

340
00:31:15,106 --> 00:31:16,471
Oh, yes.

341
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:19,999
That's what l was going to ask you.

342
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,512
Tell me...

343
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:28,083
did it sound like total drivel to you?

344
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,945
Come on. Don't hesitate.

345
00:31:31,756 --> 00:31:33,690
l haven't had much time to think about it.

346
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:36,259
That's precisely why l'm asking you.

347
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:39,421
Why do you have to think?
Thinking is his task.

348
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:43,125
Just tell me what comes from your heart.
Forget about rationality.

349
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:47,904
l didn't understand much, but...

350
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:53,977
l feel that if the English
have done wrong by splitting up Bengal,

351
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:56,603
we should not let it pass.

352
00:31:57,282 --> 00:32:01,878
lf Swadeshi can shake them up
a bit, then we should do it.

353
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:09,492
Of course, if only a few people take up
the cause, it won't have any impact.

354
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:14,630
But if the whole country joins in,
then we may succeed.

355
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:16,996
Exactly!

356
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:19,466
Exactly.

357
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:21,998
That's exactly what we're trying to do.

358
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:25,940
We want to awaken the nation
with our mantra, ''Hail Motherland!''

359
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:30,143
Don't you think there's magic
in those two words?

360
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:32,307
Have you ever said them?

361
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,147
You should.

362
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:40,282
You don't need to shout it.
Just whisper it.

363
00:32:40,391 --> 00:32:45,658
As a matter of fact,
when you all shouted that mantra,

364
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,224
l felt a --

365
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,524
A thrill?

366
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:52,896
A shiver down my spine.

367
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:54,733
That's how it should be.

368
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:59,772
Did you know that your husband
doesn't believe in our mantra?

369
00:33:00,044 --> 00:33:04,378
lsn't that right, Nikhil?
-- l don't believe in propaganda.

370
00:33:05,016 --> 00:33:07,985
Propaganda?
What do you mean by that?

371
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:14,350
lf you're recruiting people who have never
cared about their country's problems before,

372
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:16,017
how can you do it
without using propaganda?

373
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:19,325
But the cause must come first, Nikhil.

374
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:21,193
That's all that matters.

375
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:23,665
Commitment to the cause
will come through inspiration,

376
00:33:23,768 --> 00:33:26,328
and the inspiration
will come from our mantra.

377
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:29,372
Don't you remember the significance of
<i>''La MarseiIIaise"</i> in the French Revolution?

378
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:36,346
What we need most today
is to rouse the people to action.

379
00:33:36,614 --> 00:33:39,447
Our poets are writing Swadeshi songs.

380
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:41,609
Their sole purpose is to inspire the people.

381
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:43,550
Have you ever heard any?

382
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:49,192
<i>Do you think you are strong enough</i>
<i>to break destiny's bonds?</i>

383
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:51,727
<i>Are you that strong?</i>

384
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:56,664
<i>Do you think you are strong enough</i>
<i>to break destiny's bonds?</i>

385
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:58,429
<i>Are you that strong?</i>

386
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:01,835
<i>Just because you</i>
<i>hoId the power over us</i>

387
00:34:01,939 --> 00:34:04,430
<i>You take so much pride</i>

388
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:07,010
<i>Why do you take so much pride?</i>

389
00:34:07,111 --> 00:34:11,980
<i>Do you think you are strong enough</i>
<i>to break destiny's bonds?</i>

390
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:13,710
<i>Are you that strong?</i>

391
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:17,254
<i>Just because you</i>
<i>hoId the power over us</i>

392
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:19,721
<i>You take so much pride</i>

393
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:22,258
<i>Why do you take so much pride?</i>

394
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:25,090
<i>Do you think you are strong enough</i>

395
00:34:25,196 --> 00:34:27,630
<i>To keep us back forever?</i>

396
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:30,098
<i>To hoId us down forever?</i>

397
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:32,499
<i>To keep us back forever?</i>

398
00:34:32,603 --> 00:34:35,094
<i>To hoId us down forever?</i>

399
00:34:35,206 --> 00:34:37,470
<i>You don't have that much strength</i>

400
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:39,600
<i>You don't have that much strength</i>

401
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:42,201
<i>Your strength wiII not withstand us</i>

402
00:34:42,313 --> 00:34:47,046
<i>Do you think you are strong enough</i>
<i>to break destiny's bonds?</i>

403
00:34:47,151 --> 00:34:49,346
<i>Are you that strong?</i>

404
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:52,521
<i>You may try to govern us</i>

405
00:34:52,623 --> 00:34:54,648
<i>But even the weak can summon strength</i>

406
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:57,560
<i>You may try to govern us</i>

407
00:34:57,662 --> 00:34:59,994
<i>But even the weak can summon strength</i>

408
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,464
<i>You may pride</i>

409
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:04,535
<i>You may pride</i>

410
00:35:04,635 --> 00:35:07,468
<i>But God is stiII mightier</i>

411
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:12,407
<i>Rob us of our strength</i>
<i>and you dig your own grave</i>

412
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:17,470
<i>Rob us of our strength</i>
<i>and you dig your own grave</i>

413
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:19,982
<i>Your boat wiII sureIy sink</i>

414
00:35:20,084 --> 00:35:22,211
<i>Your boat wiII sureIy sink</i>

415
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,686
<i>Under the weight of your own guiIt</i>

416
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:29,783
<i>Do you think you are strong enough</i>
<i>to break destiny's bonds?</i>

417
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:31,384
<i>Are you that strong?</i>

418
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:34,795
<i>Just because you</i>

00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:37,367

420
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:39,868
<i>Why do you take so much pride?</i>

421
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:44,908
<i>Do you think you are strong enough</i>
<i>to break destiny's bonds?</i>

422
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:47,910
<i>Are you that strong?</i>

423
00:35:49,514 --> 00:35:52,415
l admit it's a beautiful song.

424
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:55,681
Oh, my. What's all this?

425
00:35:55,786 --> 00:35:58,778
Swadeshi tea. Darjeeling.

426
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:01,916
But there's a lot more here than just tea.

427
00:36:02,026 --> 00:36:06,019
You should have
some sweets too, not just tea.

428
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:09,793
They're not only Swadeshi,
Bimala made them herself.

429
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:11,664
-- Really?
-- Yes.

430
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:14,033
Then l have to try one.

431
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:18,307
l haven't gotten over
my weakness for sweets yet.

432
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:20,934
Nor your weakness
for foreign cigarettes, l see.

433
00:36:21,045 --> 00:36:22,376
Out of the question.

434
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,075
Are you familiar
with the Swadeshi brands?

435
00:36:26,617 --> 00:36:27,982
Unthinkable!

436
00:36:28,085 --> 00:36:30,747
-- Can't you give it up?
-- Smoking?

437
00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:34,250
Don't you have the willpower?

438
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:43,200
Okay. Join our party,
and l'll stop smoking.

439
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,794
Any sugar?

440
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:48,428
One teaspoon if it's foreign,
two if it's lndian.

441
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,910
So tell me...

442
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,809
what are your plans?

443
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:04,054
They're not settled yet.

444
00:37:05,089 --> 00:37:09,025
Your neighbor, the land owner
Harish Kundu, has sent for me.

445
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:14,128
They're having a bonfire
of foreign clothes at his place.

446
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:18,798
He wants me to help run the event,
so l must go there at once.

447
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:23,033
Madam Bimala,

448
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:27,474
did you know that the only stumbling
block left is your husband?

449
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,910
He refuses to help the cause.

450
00:37:31,115 --> 00:37:34,915
You'll find many landed gentry
around here who support Swadeshi.

451
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,312
What's the harm
in leaving my estate out of it?

452
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:42,187
You see?
Did you see that?

453
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:44,693
Not even a shred of patriotism in him.

454
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:51,134
Ah, well.

455
00:37:52,003 --> 00:37:53,197
So...

456
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,173
will you join our cause?

457
00:37:58,075 --> 00:37:59,337
Don't worry.

458
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:01,809
You don't have to sign
a pledge or anything.

459
00:38:02,713 --> 00:38:05,307
You'll stay exactly as you are.

460
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:07,509
l'll come to you if need be.

461
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:12,345
Well?

462
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,151
Yes or no?

463
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:16,015
All right.

464
00:38:17,528 --> 00:38:19,325
l should be going now.

465
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:22,828
-- Do you have to?
-- Yes, l have work to do.

466
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:25,800
My boys are waiting downstairs.

467
00:38:26,704 --> 00:38:32,040
Madam Bimala, this is truly
a memorable day for me.

468
00:38:32,543 --> 00:38:34,408
l only have one request.

469
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:36,742
Always trust your intuition.

470
00:38:36,847 --> 00:38:39,407
Don't let this gentleman influence you.

471
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:42,614
Rest assured, Sandip.

472
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:47,085
From now on,
my wife is a free agent.

473
00:38:47,191 --> 00:38:48,749
Wonderful!

474
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,651
Good. l'll be going then.

475
00:38:51,962 --> 00:38:54,396
l'll see you out.

476
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:42,876
<i>HaiI MotherIand!</i>

477
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,389
Hail Motherland.

478
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:10,172
-- You haven't told me yet.
-- What?

479
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:13,672
What you thought of my friend.

480
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:16,975
But l only met him once.

481
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:24,148
l think the less one knows Sandip,
the better one likes him.

482
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:27,190
You seem to have so little in common.

483
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:30,924
l wonder how you managed
to become friends.

484
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:35,863
That's not unusual, Bimala.

485
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:41,633
Friendships aren't
worked out mathematically.

486
00:40:43,507 --> 00:40:46,965
We've been friends since college.

487
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:50,779
lt's not like we have nothing in common.

488
00:40:52,249 --> 00:40:59,485
We both decided to reject
the irrational conventions of our society.

489
00:41:00,157 --> 00:41:04,753
He's always been more radical than l.

490
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:10,191
When his parents arranged a bride for him,

491
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:13,327
he was so annoyed
he severed all ties with them.

492
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:25,178
Shortly after we got married,
he asked me to introduce him to you.

493
00:41:27,384 --> 00:41:30,547
He would remind me from time to time.

494
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:34,724
Finally, he said,

495
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:39,223
''l don't believe a word
you've said about your wife.''

496
00:41:45,135 --> 00:41:48,400
And do you know what he said today?
-- What?

497
00:41:54,812 --> 00:41:57,747
-- l'm not telling you.
-- Why not?

498
00:42:00,217 --> 00:42:03,050
What can he say about you
after such a brief meeting?

499
00:42:03,888 --> 00:42:06,948
l could say a lot more.

500
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:10,259
But you never do.

501
00:42:11,729 --> 00:42:14,129
Do l have to?

502
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:17,766
Don't you have your intuition?

503
00:42:58,442 --> 00:43:01,275
-- <i>Madam.</i>
-- What is it?

504
00:43:01,378 --> 00:43:03,812
<i>A Ietter from Mr. Mukherjee.</i>

505
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:17,857
l hope the rule wasn't intended
to be broken for one day alone.

506
00:43:17,962 --> 00:43:21,261
Can l see you for a moment?

507
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:25,191
-- Tell him l'm coming.
-- As you wish.

508
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:33,970
''When Krishna's flute beckons so,
how can l not go?''

509
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:26,924
Hail Motherland.

510
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:30,163
My husband's not here.

511
00:44:30,968 --> 00:44:34,062
l didn't ask for him.
l asked for you.

512
00:44:35,072 --> 00:44:36,869
Won't you sit down?

513
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:44,640
You've eluded me for years.

514
00:44:44,748 --> 00:44:47,876
You mustn't keep your distance now.

515
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:51,882
Come and sit here,
right beside me.

516
00:45:17,448 --> 00:45:19,109
What's the matter?

517
00:45:21,485 --> 00:45:23,578
l can't believe it.

518
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:29,754
Ever since you married, Nikhil promised
he would introduce me to you.

519
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:32,328
l never believed him.

520
00:45:32,429 --> 00:45:35,364
Even now, l find it hard to believe.

521
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:39,730
Until now, l've only heard about
your many accomplishments.

522
00:45:39,837 --> 00:45:41,930
You learned English from a <i>memsahib.</i>

523
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:46,999
You love reading books, knitting, cooking.

524
00:45:47,111 --> 00:45:51,741
l even know what you like to cook,
to eat, your favorite flowers.

525
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:53,942
l know everything.

526
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:58,147
l also know something else.

527
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:04,091
You resent the fact
that Nikhil lends me money.

528
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:08,197
So you really aren't a stranger to me.

529
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:11,930
But l never imagined...

530
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:17,563
l'd one day find myself
sitting by your side.

531
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:21,910
-- Did you go to Rangpur?
-- Yes, l did.

532
00:46:22,012 --> 00:46:24,845
-- How was the trip?
-- Great.

533
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:28,683
That's why the first thing l wanted
to see this morning was you.

534
00:46:30,087 --> 00:46:32,248
Don't you have to leave again?

535
00:46:32,356 --> 00:46:34,722
-- Where to?
-- To Rangpur.

536
00:46:34,825 --> 00:46:37,623
lsn't that your base?

537
00:46:38,328 --> 00:46:42,321
That was the idea, but not anymore.

538
00:46:42,866 --> 00:46:44,458
lt's not?

539
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:48,904
Let me be frank with you.

540
00:46:49,439 --> 00:46:51,634
l want to be near you when l work.

541
00:46:56,213 --> 00:46:59,512
Just like a bee working for the queen.

542
00:46:59,616 --> 00:47:01,174
You'll be the queen bee.

543
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:06,186
Do you have any objection?

544
00:47:07,524 --> 00:47:11,392
But won't you find it inconvenient
working from here?

545
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:19,128
That's true.

546
00:47:21,972 --> 00:47:27,672
l don't think Nikhil will approve of this.

547
00:47:31,748 --> 00:47:33,443
But the thing is...

548
00:47:36,587 --> 00:47:38,817
l am essentially...

549
00:47:42,226 --> 00:47:44,057
a stubborn man.

550
00:47:45,896 --> 00:47:49,332
l just can't accept Nikhil's attitude.

551
00:47:52,102 --> 00:47:58,234
l want to promote
the Swadeshi cause right here...

552
00:47:59,443 --> 00:48:01,468
and l need your help.

553
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:06,114
But l really know nothing about your work.

554
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:09,947
l know that you
give speeches. ls that all?

555
00:48:12,356 --> 00:48:15,154
That's one of the most important things.

556
00:48:16,093 --> 00:48:18,459
Persuasion can work wonders.

557
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,754
Wait.

558
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:25,591
lf you really want to know about our work,

559
00:48:26,336 --> 00:48:27,803
then read this.

560
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:29,167
OUR STRUGGLE

561
00:48:29,273 --> 00:48:31,867
lt contains everything you need to know.

562
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,511
l will definitely read it.

563
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:42,884
May l tell you something now?

564
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:47,215
One of the biggest markets
in this area is here, in Sukhsayar.

565
00:48:47,324 --> 00:48:50,487
Did you know that?
-- So l've heard.

566
00:48:51,061 --> 00:48:56,863
lt's the only market in the area
where foreign goods are still being sold.

567
00:48:57,134 --> 00:49:00,968
Elsewhere, the landowners
have prohibited their sale,

568
00:49:01,071 --> 00:49:02,663
but Nikhil hasn't.

569
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:06,368
l'm going to do my best to change that,

570
00:49:06,743 --> 00:49:11,476
but, with your help,
my task will be much easier.

571
00:49:11,581 --> 00:49:15,108
l'm afraid you're overestimating
my capabilities.

572
00:49:15,218 --> 00:49:17,083
Not at all.

573
00:49:17,888 --> 00:49:22,188
Nikhil may be my friend,
but he's your husband.

574
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:25,261
You have much more influence
over him than l do.

575
00:49:25,362 --> 00:49:29,128
My husband isn't easily swayed.

576
00:49:29,433 --> 00:49:31,025
l know...

577
00:49:31,768 --> 00:49:34,601
but l think he'll listen to you.

578
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:41,971
l know how much you mean to Nikhil.

579
00:49:43,347 --> 00:49:45,815
Will you try just once to persuade him?

580
00:49:48,418 --> 00:49:51,683
Nikhil's tenants wouldn't dare
to go against his will.

581
00:49:51,788 --> 00:49:55,019
He only has to tell them not to bring
any more foreign goods to the market.

582
00:49:56,193 --> 00:49:57,990
And if l fail to persuade him?

583
00:49:58,795 --> 00:50:01,491
l'll be happy if you just try.

584
00:50:02,766 --> 00:50:04,859
lf you fail, l'll find another way.

585
00:50:05,769 --> 00:50:07,760
Not without the queen bee's
knowledge, of course.

586
00:50:09,306 --> 00:50:11,900
Can l depend on you?

587
00:50:12,976 --> 00:50:14,534
l'll try my best.

588
00:50:22,386 --> 00:50:24,047
The more l see you,

589
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:26,780
the more l admire you.

590
00:50:38,802 --> 00:50:40,201
l think l'll --

591
00:50:40,737 --> 00:50:43,035
Okay, you may go now.

592
00:50:47,244 --> 00:50:49,041
Oh, and one more thing.

593
00:50:51,014 --> 00:50:52,242
This item of yours.

594
00:50:59,923 --> 00:51:05,259
This is the only foreign item
l will keep with me.

595
00:51:10,033 --> 00:51:12,467
Did you see Sandip today?

596
00:51:13,703 --> 00:51:15,000
<i>Yes.</i>

597
00:51:17,707 --> 00:51:19,504
How is he doing?

598
00:51:20,977 --> 00:51:22,911
He's worried.

599
00:51:23,013 --> 00:51:24,503
Why?

600
00:51:26,183 --> 00:51:28,481
You won't let him promote
the Swadeshi cause here.

601
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:32,320
Nonsense.
You heard me yourself.

602
00:51:32,689 --> 00:51:36,785
He's free to fight for his cause
as long as he leaves my estate alone.

603
00:51:38,295 --> 00:51:40,661
He says he's staying here.

604
00:51:41,965 --> 00:51:43,523
Staying here?

605
00:51:44,501 --> 00:51:45,991
That's what he says.

606
00:51:46,803 --> 00:51:48,964
He's going to stay and work here.

607
00:51:51,374 --> 00:51:53,399
That wouldn't be right.

608
00:51:54,644 --> 00:51:56,612
But all of Bengal has taken up
the Swadeshi cause.

609
00:51:56,713 --> 00:51:57,805
Why don't you?

610
00:51:58,849 --> 00:52:04,219
That would mean banning
all foreign goods from the market.

611
00:52:05,155 --> 00:52:07,953
Harish Kundu can do that, but not me.

612
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:11,022
Surely the market belongs to you.
Why can't you?

613
00:52:12,028 --> 00:52:14,019
lt's not my market, Bimala.

614
00:52:14,531 --> 00:52:17,796
The market belongs to the traders
who sell their goods there.

615
00:52:17,901 --> 00:52:19,562
They're poor.

616
00:52:21,171 --> 00:52:26,040
Foreign goods are cheaper
and of better quality than lndian goods.

617
00:52:28,111 --> 00:52:32,138
The poor villagers can afford them.
How can l force them not to buy them?

618
00:52:35,118 --> 00:52:39,282
Swadeshi is for those who can afford it,

619
00:52:39,389 --> 00:52:41,220
not for the poor.

620
00:52:46,196 --> 00:52:47,925
What are you thinking?

621
00:52:48,798 --> 00:52:50,698
Can we follow Swadeshi...

622
00:52:53,203 --> 00:52:54,932
without making the poor suffer?

623
00:52:55,038 --> 00:52:56,733
ls it possible?

624
00:52:57,407 --> 00:53:00,843
lf it were possible,
l'd definitely support Swadeshi.

625
00:53:01,978 --> 00:53:04,412
You believe the very idea
of Swadeshi is wrong.

626
00:53:05,815 --> 00:53:08,477
Even if l do,
who would listen to me?

627
00:53:08,585 --> 00:53:11,019
The entire country supports Swadeshi.

628
00:53:11,821 --> 00:53:14,312
You yourself believe Sandip is right.

629
00:53:14,424 --> 00:53:16,654
Many others must feel the same way.

630
00:53:18,562 --> 00:53:25,400
But l believe that coercing the poor
can only harm our country.

631
00:53:31,274 --> 00:53:33,674
l can see you're not convinced.

632
00:53:34,778 --> 00:53:37,406
l was looking at it differently.

633
00:53:37,514 --> 00:53:41,109
l was thinking that
something has to be done.

634
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:43,243
Even if it means
hardship for the poor now,

635
00:53:43,353 --> 00:53:45,548
it will help them in the long run.

636
00:53:45,956 --> 00:53:48,925
The Swadeshi care about this country.

637
00:53:50,493 --> 00:53:56,796
l believe what they care about
is an abstract idea of this country,

638
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:59,494
this country as the Mother Goddess.

639
00:54:00,303 --> 00:54:02,100
The nation is our mother.

640
00:54:02,205 --> 00:54:07,438
Worship our mother,
work for our mother, pray to our mother.

641
00:54:08,211 --> 00:54:11,044
Everything you do is for our mother.

642
00:54:11,715 --> 00:54:14,149
Heal our mother's pain.

643
00:54:14,884 --> 00:54:16,545
l can understand that.

644
00:54:17,387 --> 00:54:20,185
And l can understand why
that idea appeals to women.

645
00:54:20,824 --> 00:54:23,657
l know how you feel, Bimala,

646
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:26,126
but l don't feel the same way.

647
00:54:50,186 --> 00:54:52,347
Those things you said tonight...

648
00:54:52,689 --> 00:54:54,850
Were those your own thoughts?

649
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:57,119
Why are you asking me this?

650
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:02,322
l felt as if you were speaking for Sandip.

651
00:55:02,432 --> 00:55:05,333
Sandip is your friend, not mine.

652
00:55:06,936 --> 00:55:12,135
l thought you two had teamed up
''in right earnest'' to fight for a higher cause.

653
00:55:13,043 --> 00:55:16,410
He's working on the public front,
and you on the domestic.

654
00:55:16,513 --> 00:55:18,071
What an idea!

655
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:28,484
Will you have daily meetings?

656
00:55:29,025 --> 00:55:33,894
You insisted that l meet your friend,
so you can spare me the insinuations.

657
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:49,972
l just asked a simple question.

658
00:55:50,747 --> 00:55:53,307
l wasn't insinuating anything.
-- Very well.

659
00:55:53,416 --> 00:55:56,442
lf it upsets you so much,
l won't go outside anymore.

660
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:59,288
You're mistaken, Bimala.

661
00:55:59,389 --> 00:56:01,653
l'm not upset at all.

662
00:56:02,158 --> 00:56:05,321
After all, l know you both so well.

663
00:56:05,428 --> 00:56:09,888
Why shouldn't you go outside?
-- Because l don't want to.

664
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,592
You're being unreasonable.

665
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:16,263
l've been out twice already.
l don't have to go out every day.

666
00:56:19,008 --> 00:56:20,737
Very well.

667
00:56:30,754 --> 00:56:36,021
l won't restrict you
from going where you please.

668
00:56:37,293 --> 00:56:42,094
As l told you,
you are completely free.

669
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:47,670
But l must tell you one thing.

670
00:56:49,539 --> 00:56:53,566
lf you tell me you want to give up
wearing foreign clothes,

671
00:56:54,177 --> 00:56:59,171
or do without your foreign
perfumes, shoes and soap,

672
00:56:59,482 --> 00:57:01,712
l won't mind at all.

673
00:57:02,018 --> 00:57:04,418
But clamping down on poor traders

674
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:09,217
by banning foreign goods in the market

675
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:13,220
means going against
my own beliefs and principles.

676
00:57:13,797 --> 00:57:16,095
l could never do that, Bimala.

677
00:57:22,539 --> 00:57:26,475
Swadeshi is something l can't take lightly.

678
00:57:32,749 --> 00:57:37,243
<i>The weak say, ''Whatever fate</i>
<i>has given to me is mine. "</i>

679
00:57:37,353 --> 00:57:41,687
<i>And the impotent agree with them.</i>

680
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:44,555
<i>''OnIy what I can snatch away</i>
<i>by force is mine. "</i>

681
00:57:44,661 --> 00:57:47,186
<i>That is what experience has taught us.</i>

682
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:50,460
<i>My country is not mine</i>
<i>simpIy because I was born here.</i>

683
00:57:50,567 --> 00:57:54,435
<i>It becomes mine</i>
<i>onIy when I am abIe to win it by force.</i>

684
00:57:54,537 --> 00:57:56,869
<i>OnIy then can the nation be mine.</i>

685
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:09,377
This funeral pyre celebrates the cremation
of foreign trade in your village.

686
00:58:10,186 --> 00:58:12,450
These ashes are sacred.

687
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:14,551
Hail Motherland!

688
00:58:30,039 --> 00:58:35,341
AN URGENT MATTER
REGARDlNG OUR CAUSE

689
00:58:46,589 --> 00:58:50,491
-- Please give this to Mrs. Choudhury.
-- Very well.

690
00:59:32,268 --> 00:59:34,327
Madam isn't feeling well, sir.

691
00:59:39,342 --> 00:59:41,173
l see.

692
00:59:52,221 --> 00:59:55,349
-- You know the headmaster, don't you?
-- Yes, of course.

693
00:59:55,458 --> 00:59:58,689
Good morning.
l hope you are doing well.

694
00:59:59,896 --> 01:00:02,660
Not as long as you're around.

695
01:00:06,302 --> 01:00:07,599
How come?

696
01:00:08,004 --> 01:00:11,440
His students have all disappeared
since you arrived.

697
01:00:12,976 --> 01:00:18,505
But you must admit that working
for one's country helps build character.

698
01:00:21,217 --> 01:00:25,620
One of my students was influenced
by the Swadeshi movement.

699
01:00:25,722 --> 01:00:29,624
He threw a stone at Mrs. Choudhury's
governess, Miss Gilby.

700
01:00:30,226 --> 01:00:32,990
Would you consider that
an example of character building?

701
01:00:33,529 --> 01:00:36,794
But that happened before l came.

702
01:00:37,333 --> 01:00:39,631
You can't blame me for that.

703
01:00:39,736 --> 01:00:43,103
After all, you must admit
that a few such incidents

704
01:00:43,206 --> 01:00:47,609
are inevitable in times
of great social upheaval.

705
01:00:48,177 --> 01:00:50,805
You even roped in my best student.

706
01:00:50,913 --> 01:00:53,006
Who? Amulya?

707
01:00:54,784 --> 01:00:57,048
He'd have won a scholarship
if he'd taken his exam.

708
01:00:57,153 --> 01:00:59,883
You stole that opportunity from him.

709
01:01:00,423 --> 01:01:03,586
Amulya? l didn't rope him in.
He joined of his own accord.

710
01:01:04,093 --> 01:01:08,757
What about the other rowdy dissolutes
who have joined your team?

711
01:01:08,865 --> 01:01:11,959
They're the worst troublemakers in the village.

712
01:01:12,068 --> 01:01:14,593
They're not troublemakers anymore, sir.

713
01:01:14,704 --> 01:01:17,605
They're fighting for the cause.
They're working hard.

714
01:01:18,074 --> 01:01:21,942
With two exceptions,
everyone here is working for the cause.

715
01:01:22,045 --> 01:01:23,706
One of them is you.

716
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:28,516
The other one is your former
student Nikhilesh Choudhury.

717
01:01:28,618 --> 01:01:31,849
l regret that
l couldn't persuade him to join.

718
01:01:31,954 --> 01:01:34,718
Like you, he turns a deaf ear
to the Swadeshi cause.

719
01:01:34,824 --> 01:01:37,759
No, he isn't against Swadeshi ideals.

720
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:41,990
He's against your
destructive brand of Swadeshi.

721
01:01:42,598 --> 01:01:44,862
He practiced Swadeshi long before you,

722
01:01:44,967 --> 01:01:47,936
and he never relied
on any battle cries or mantras.

723
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:50,801
-- l know that.
-- You know nothing!

724
01:01:50,907 --> 01:01:53,000
Do you know about his Swadeshi bank?

725
01:01:53,109 --> 01:01:56,567
Or his Swadeshi sugar factory,
his soap factory?

726
01:01:56,679 --> 01:02:01,912
Do you know he set up his own looms
for weaving Swadeshi cloth?

727
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:07,221
Where were you
and your ''Hail Motherland'' then?

728
01:02:07,757 --> 01:02:11,284
Do you know how much
he spent for Swadeshi?

729
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:13,419
-- Please, headmaster --
-- You stay out of this!

730
01:02:13,529 --> 01:02:17,932
These things must be said.
-- But that's what l keep telling him.

731
01:02:18,034 --> 01:02:21,663
lf both of us have the same goals,
then why doesn't he join us?

732
01:02:21,771 --> 01:02:25,673
You don't have the same goals.
There are many differences.

733
01:02:25,775 --> 01:02:30,144
Your goal is power and leadership.

734
01:02:30,246 --> 01:02:32,407
You don't care about the people!

735
01:02:32,515 --> 01:02:35,313
Nikhil never thought about himself.

736
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:40,151
People are applauding you
and singing your praises.

737
01:02:41,023 --> 01:02:43,355
Nikhil was ridiculed.

738
01:02:43,459 --> 01:02:48,089
He had no head for business,
so his brand of Swadeshi didn't last.

739
01:02:48,197 --> 01:02:50,529
But his way was the right way.

740
01:02:50,967 --> 01:02:52,559
Yours is wrong.

741
01:02:52,668 --> 01:02:54,295
lt's more than wrong.

742
01:02:54,403 --> 01:02:56,462
lt's dangerous.

743
01:02:59,075 --> 01:03:00,770
Give those to me.

744
01:03:01,944 --> 01:03:04,777
l'll drop by this evening.

745
01:03:08,985 --> 01:03:10,885
My goodness.

746
01:03:14,023 --> 01:03:17,424
Please, Nikhil, l implore you.

747
01:03:17,527 --> 01:03:20,325
Keep that headmaster away from me.

748
01:03:20,429 --> 01:03:24,388
l came here to give speeches,
not listen to them.

749
01:03:26,068 --> 01:03:28,059
Are you planning to stay here and work?

750
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:39,805
l'm going to speak
at your market this afternoon.

751
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:43,615
That's where our greatest
challenge lies, Nikhil.

752
01:03:45,087 --> 01:03:50,150
Not where the landowner
is already in favor of Swadeshi,

753
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:53,625
but where he isn't.

754
01:03:53,729 --> 01:03:55,754
But remember, Sandip,

755
01:03:56,365 --> 01:03:59,163
most of my tenants are poor Muslims.

756
01:04:00,803 --> 01:04:05,831
l don't want them harassed.

757
01:04:07,343 --> 01:04:12,007
lf l see that happening,
l will be forced to intervene.

758
01:04:13,382 --> 01:04:16,476
lf they prove to be obstacles
to our revolution,

759
01:04:16,752 --> 01:04:19,152
l'll have to take the necessary measures.

760
01:04:19,622 --> 01:04:21,522
Many Muslims have accepted Swadeshi.

761
01:04:22,758 --> 01:04:24,623
They were forced to do so.

762
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:27,996
lt will happen here too.

763
01:04:31,467 --> 01:04:33,367
l've said what l had to say.

764
01:04:34,203 --> 01:04:38,469
What you do now is up to you.

765
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:46,910
As you all know,

766
01:04:47,016 --> 01:04:49,348
our English rulers

767
01:04:49,452 --> 01:04:53,388
have divided Bengal in two.

768
01:04:53,823 --> 01:05:01,355
This amounts to erecting a wall
between Hindus and Muslims.

769
01:05:01,697 --> 01:05:07,192
They have not given us
the right to break this wall,

770
01:05:07,303 --> 01:05:11,706
but, to foil the government,
we have chosen a different path.

771
01:05:11,807 --> 01:05:14,435
One important way to fight the partition

772
01:05:14,543 --> 01:05:19,776
is to stop selling foreign goods
in our markets.

773
01:05:20,483 --> 01:05:26,183
Salt, sugar, cloth and soap
are all everyday items

774
01:05:26,289 --> 01:05:29,588
which are only available
as foreign products at your market.

775
01:05:30,293 --> 01:05:32,727
By selling their foreign goods here,

776
01:05:32,828 --> 01:05:37,959
the British are making
a lot of money in our country,

777
01:05:38,067 --> 01:05:42,902
while we keep growing poorer.

778
01:05:43,005 --> 01:05:45,599
This is wrong.
This must stop.

779
01:05:45,708 --> 01:05:49,166
We've tolerated this up to now,
but no more.

780
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:55,877
l know that lndian substitutes
for foreign goods are not always available,

781
01:05:55,985 --> 01:06:00,718
so you've had to trade with foreign goods
because that's all you had.

782
01:06:00,823 --> 01:06:04,190
But if we can all make sacrifices

783
01:06:04,293 --> 01:06:08,195
and produce our own goods,

784
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:12,028
then we will overcome these difficulties.

785
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:15,634
Brothers, we are depending on you.

786
01:06:16,238 --> 01:06:18,172
lf you come forward and join us,

787
01:06:18,274 --> 01:06:21,141
together we will stop
the partitioning of Bengal

788
01:06:21,243 --> 01:06:23,711
and regain our pride.

789
01:06:24,246 --> 01:06:28,706
And now, do you see
this circle here before me?

790
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:34,085
Throw all your foreign goods
into the circle of flags.

791
01:06:34,957 --> 01:06:38,017
lndian substitutes will be made.

792
01:06:38,861 --> 01:06:41,921
Many manufacturers
have come forward to help us.

793
01:06:42,365 --> 01:06:45,528
Have no fear of losing your livelihood.

794
01:06:46,168 --> 01:06:49,831
Today's loss will not be lost forever.

795
01:06:49,939 --> 01:06:54,706
Now l ask you to throw all
of your foreign goods into the circle.

796
01:06:55,077 --> 01:07:00,071
The land that gave birth to you,
the land that you love...

797
01:07:00,182 --> 01:07:02,673
Now is the time to help her.

798
01:07:03,152 --> 01:07:06,849
Foreign cloth, foreign thread,

799
01:07:06,956 --> 01:07:10,187
foreign sugar, foreign salt,

800
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:12,557
foreign scissors and knives,

801
01:07:12,661 --> 01:07:16,153
foreign matches,
and everything else foreign...

802
01:07:16,265 --> 01:07:18,790
Throw them in that circle.

803
01:07:18,901 --> 01:07:22,530
We beseech you.
Don't just sit there.

804
01:07:22,638 --> 01:07:24,970
Help the Swadeshi cause.

805
01:07:25,074 --> 01:07:29,033
We want to hear it from the maharaja!
Let him come here.

806
01:07:29,545 --> 01:07:30,910
We won't listen to you!

807
01:07:32,815 --> 01:07:35,340
Your maharaja is my friend.

808
01:07:35,451 --> 01:07:37,851
l'm his guest.

809
01:07:37,953 --> 01:07:41,218
lsn't that proof enough
that l have his support?

810
01:07:41,323 --> 01:07:44,315
We're traders.
lf we have nothing to sell, we'll starve!

811
01:07:44,427 --> 01:07:47,521
We've tried selling lndian goods.

812
01:07:47,630 --> 01:07:48,927
Nobody buys them.

813
01:07:49,031 --> 01:07:51,829
You're a gentleman.
You have money.

814
01:07:51,934 --> 01:07:55,665
lt's easy for you to say,
''Don't sell foreign goods.''

815
01:07:55,771 --> 01:07:58,604
We're poor!
How will we survive?

816
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:07,849
<i>It's cIear that persuasion</i>
<i>won't work on NikhiI's estate.</i>

817
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:10,544
<i>We'II have to use other means.</i>

818
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:15,684
<i>Any compromise on foreign goods</i>
<i>wouId crippIe our movement.</i>

819
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:20,820
<i>HaiI MotherIand!</i>

820
01:08:59,735 --> 01:09:01,202
This is Mr. Kulada.

821
01:09:01,303 --> 01:09:02,998
Greetings.

822
01:09:03,105 --> 01:09:04,197
Please follow me.

823
01:09:09,879 --> 01:09:12,814
Were those stolen from the villagers?

824
01:09:19,655 --> 01:09:21,122
Have a seat.

825
01:09:21,924 --> 01:09:26,486
You may enjoy your bonfire, but the villagers
will file a complaint against you.

826
01:09:28,764 --> 01:09:32,200
We'll set fire to their crops if they do.

827
01:09:33,469 --> 01:09:35,061
Can't we try picketing?

828
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:38,598
We can make them understand.

829
01:09:39,108 --> 01:09:41,099
lt's worked in other places.

830
01:09:41,644 --> 01:09:43,805
l know what works and what doesn't.

831
01:09:43,913 --> 01:09:46,108
Picketing won't work in Sukhsayar.

832
01:09:48,050 --> 01:09:49,881
Please sit, Mr. Kulada.

833
01:09:56,759 --> 01:09:58,920
A foreign brand, l see.

834
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:01,895
Yes, it's the only exception
l make to Swadeshi.

835
01:10:01,997 --> 01:10:04,659
-- May l have one?
-- Be my guest.

836
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:09,565
These people can't be persuaded, Amulya.

837
01:10:10,005 --> 01:10:11,836
They've been pampered too much.

838
01:10:11,941 --> 01:10:19,313
Listen, l've been the manager of this estate
since the maharaja's father was alive.

839
01:10:21,016 --> 01:10:23,507
The father was a tough one.

840
01:10:23,619 --> 01:10:25,849
The trouble is the son.

841
01:10:25,955 --> 01:10:27,980
lf only he'd been firm with them,

842
01:10:28,090 --> 01:10:31,821
he could have brought
these villagers to their knees.

843
01:10:31,927 --> 01:10:34,760
lt would have been smooth sailing for you.

844
01:10:37,266 --> 01:10:40,326
Anyway, tell me how you can help us.

845
01:10:41,704 --> 01:10:45,663
lf you can't stop the influx
of foreign goods,

846
01:10:46,475 --> 01:10:49,911
you can't stop the trade of foreign goods.

847
01:10:51,013 --> 01:10:55,040
Those boats bring the goods in.

848
01:10:56,085 --> 01:11:00,351
-- You'll have to deal with the boatmen first.
-- Can you do that for me?

849
01:11:01,557 --> 01:11:07,291
The problem is that the boatmen's
leader is very stubborn.

850
01:11:08,964 --> 01:11:10,955
Who is he?
What's his name?

851
01:11:11,066 --> 01:11:14,763
Mirjan.
He's a hard nut to crack.

852
01:11:16,238 --> 01:11:19,935
-- Can he be persuaded?
-- Where there's a will, there's a way.

853
01:11:20,843 --> 01:11:26,543
A boat which sails
is also a boat which sinks.

854
01:11:30,085 --> 01:11:34,112
But it's going to take
more than words to do this job.

855
01:11:34,957 --> 01:11:37,653
lt will take...
-- Money?

856
01:11:38,260 --> 01:11:40,694
We have to stop tongues from wagging,

857
01:11:40,796 --> 01:11:44,357
pay compensation,
bribe the police.

858
01:11:44,466 --> 01:11:46,229
That all takes money.

859
01:11:49,538 --> 01:11:52,029
lt's not like we don't have any money,

860
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:55,599
and more can be raised if necessary.

861
01:11:55,711 --> 01:11:58,805
Then you can rely on me.

862
01:11:59,615 --> 01:12:03,642
l'll do the dirty work,

863
01:12:03,752 --> 01:12:07,279
but if something goes wrong,

864
01:12:07,389 --> 01:12:09,186
you're on your own.

865
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:14,519
You don't need to worry about that.

866
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:17,360
Even so, if l get into any sort of trouble,

867
01:12:17,466 --> 01:12:20,162
l have no intention of taking all the blame.

868
01:12:28,277 --> 01:12:30,939
l'm keeping this letter you wrote me.

869
01:12:34,149 --> 01:12:36,208
<i>I didn't go.</i>

870
01:12:36,318 --> 01:12:38,252
<i>He asked for me.</i>

871
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:43,519
<i>I gave an excuse and stayed inside,</i>
<i>but what good did it do?</i>

872
01:12:43,625 --> 01:12:47,584
<i>I was thinking of him aII day yesterday.</i>

873
01:12:47,696 --> 01:12:50,426
<i>Why shouId this happen to a woman</i>

874
01:12:50,532 --> 01:12:57,028
<i>who has never thought about any man</i>
<i>other than her own husband?</i>

875
01:12:57,473 --> 01:13:00,271
Madam, how do you want
the fish prepared?

876
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:02,241
You never told me.

877
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:05,407
Make a curry with ground mustard seed.

878
01:13:14,289 --> 01:13:15,415
<i>Madam?</i>

879
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:18,985
Yes, Nanku?

880
01:13:19,094 --> 01:13:21,289
<i>There's a Ietter for you.</i>

881
01:13:26,301 --> 01:13:29,293
OUR STRUGGLE

882
01:13:30,539 --> 01:13:32,473
Are you feeling any better?

883
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:35,274
Yes.

884
01:13:36,044 --> 01:13:39,571
This boy from our group
was very eager to meet you.

885
01:13:43,252 --> 01:13:46,187
You met me once before when l was little.

886
01:13:46,288 --> 01:13:47,983
l came with my mother.

887
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:50,615
-- What's your mother's name?
-- Soudamini Devi.

888
01:13:52,428 --> 01:13:56,364
-- Are you Nibaron Ghosal's son?
-- Yes. My name is Amulya.

889
01:13:58,233 --> 01:14:01,100
-- How old are you?
-- Seventeen.

890
01:14:01,203 --> 01:14:03,671
l was about to take
my final exam, but l didn't.

891
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:06,366
Because of Swadeshi?

892
01:14:06,475 --> 01:14:08,375
Amulya is very hardworking.

893
01:14:09,344 --> 01:14:11,312
He remembers the entire <i>Bhagavadgita.</i>

894
01:14:12,147 --> 01:14:13,944
Really?

895
01:14:14,850 --> 01:14:16,317
Here it is.

896
01:14:16,418 --> 01:14:19,319
-- Do you always carry it with you?
-- Always.

897
01:14:19,421 --> 01:14:22,948
The <i>Bhagavadgita</i> gives one courage
to overcome one's fears.

898
01:14:23,058 --> 01:14:25,185
Even to die for one's country.

899
01:14:27,863 --> 01:14:30,331
Aren't you afraid to die?

900
01:14:30,432 --> 01:14:33,299
''For the soul, there is neither birth
nor death at any time.

901
01:14:33,402 --> 01:14:36,667
He has not come into being, does not come
into being, and will not come into being.

902
01:14:36,772 --> 01:14:39,866
He is unborn, eternal,
ever--existing and primeval.

903
01:14:39,975 --> 01:14:43,001
He is not slain when the body is slain.''

904
01:14:43,111 --> 01:14:45,443
Even when a man dies,
his soul lives on.

905
01:14:45,547 --> 01:14:48,015
Okay, Amulya.
You may go now.

906
01:14:50,085 --> 01:14:52,519
Mr. Sandip said you believe in Swadeshi.

907
01:14:52,621 --> 01:14:54,987
l wanted to pay my respects.

908
01:14:55,090 --> 01:14:56,387
l'll take my leave, sister.

909
01:14:57,359 --> 01:14:59,850
l'll come again.
-- Please do.

910
01:14:59,962 --> 01:15:01,259
Hail Motherland.

911
01:15:02,631 --> 01:15:04,861
-- Hail Motherland.
-- Good--bye.

912
01:15:16,311 --> 01:15:18,006
What are you thinking?

913
01:15:18,881 --> 01:15:22,681
ls there any danger to your life
in the work you do?

914
01:15:25,621 --> 01:15:27,111
Well...

915
01:15:28,924 --> 01:15:33,190
Since we're fighting against
the powerful British government,

916
01:15:35,130 --> 01:15:36,688
of course there is.

917
01:15:43,505 --> 01:15:46,531
But my boys are brave.

918
01:15:48,176 --> 01:15:49,939
My courage doesn't begin to match theirs.

919
01:15:50,045 --> 01:15:52,639
That's a strange confession from a leader.

920
01:15:55,918 --> 01:15:58,284
Sometimes the truth comes out.

921
01:16:03,325 --> 01:16:05,259
Now will you tell me the truth?

922
01:16:06,828 --> 01:16:08,090
What truth?

923
01:16:09,431 --> 01:16:11,695
After so many years,

924
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:14,530
why did you suddenly decide
to come out of your confinement?

925
01:16:15,237 --> 01:16:17,467
Don't you know why?

926
01:16:17,873 --> 01:16:19,738
How would l know?

927
01:16:19,841 --> 01:16:21,809
You should know.

928
01:16:22,978 --> 01:16:26,880
You should, but you're a man.

929
01:16:26,982 --> 01:16:28,973
You don't have a woman's intuition.

930
01:16:30,919 --> 01:16:32,147
Will you tell me?

931
01:16:49,137 --> 01:16:50,331
Why?

932
01:16:59,548 --> 01:17:03,006
l'd never been face--to--face
with a leader before.

933
01:17:05,153 --> 01:17:09,055
l fear the leader may have let you down.

934
01:17:17,132 --> 01:17:19,794
Not so far.

935
01:17:43,692 --> 01:17:45,250
You play the piano too?

936
01:17:46,828 --> 01:17:48,819
l was taking lessons.

937
01:17:49,164 --> 01:17:50,529
Piano...

938
01:17:51,566 --> 01:17:53,158
singing.

939
01:17:54,069 --> 01:17:55,832
English songs?

940
01:18:28,170 --> 01:18:29,967
You didn't come yesterday.

941
01:18:30,572 --> 01:18:35,509
l had a feeling you weren't really ill.

942
01:18:36,278 --> 01:18:39,008
l racked my brain all day trying to guess...

943
01:18:40,048 --> 01:18:46,647
what l had done or said to annoy you.

944
01:18:49,124 --> 01:18:52,616
You still haven't told me
why you called.

945
01:18:53,261 --> 01:18:55,525
l just wanted to see you.

946
01:18:57,099 --> 01:18:58,828
ls that the only reason?

947
01:19:01,903 --> 01:19:03,996
l didn't see you yesterday,

948
01:19:04,573 --> 01:19:06,700
and it turned out
to be a dismal day for me.

949
01:19:07,242 --> 01:19:09,574
My pride as a leader...

950
01:19:10,545 --> 01:19:12,137
was badly shaken.

951
01:19:13,115 --> 01:19:15,208
The people won't listen to you?

952
01:19:15,684 --> 01:19:19,017
Sometimes words are not enough.

953
01:19:19,121 --> 01:19:23,114
-- What do you do then?
-- l try other ways.

954
01:19:23,792 --> 01:19:25,259
May l know what ways?

955
01:19:26,828 --> 01:19:29,319
Because my husband's
not going to help you.

956
01:19:33,735 --> 01:19:34,929
Nikhil said so?

957
01:19:43,712 --> 01:19:45,976
Do you know what l feel
like doing sometimes?

958
01:19:46,815 --> 01:19:48,715
To hell with Swadeshi.

959
01:19:49,284 --> 01:19:52,117
l'll spend my life
chatting with the queen bee.

960
01:19:54,022 --> 01:19:55,580
With me?

961
01:19:56,057 --> 01:19:57,024
Chatting?

962
01:19:58,260 --> 01:20:00,023
Would that bother you?

963
01:20:03,465 --> 01:20:04,932
Why are you laughing?

964
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:08,196
That's so absurd.

965
01:20:08,303 --> 01:20:12,364
You're not the type to spend
even an hour chatting.

966
01:20:15,510 --> 01:20:16,977
You're right.

967
01:20:18,613 --> 01:20:20,012
The truth is...

968
01:20:21,283 --> 01:20:22,978
l need Swadeshi...

969
01:20:24,553 --> 01:20:26,453
just as much as l need you.

970
01:20:29,157 --> 01:20:32,217
l don't want you to stop
fighting for the country.

971
01:20:33,395 --> 01:20:37,695
My husband and l don't see
eye to eye on that matter.

972
01:20:38,166 --> 01:20:42,728
He has many virtues,
and l admire him for that.

973
01:20:43,405 --> 01:20:49,537
But, for a man, he is much too placid.

974
01:20:49,644 --> 01:20:53,080
A person can't afford to be so placid
at a time like this.

975
01:20:56,618 --> 01:20:59,314
l agree with you entirely.

976
01:21:00,989 --> 01:21:05,119
My husband says
you don't care about the poor,

977
01:21:05,227 --> 01:21:08,594
so you can't really do
any good for our country.

978
01:21:11,399 --> 01:21:15,165
l don't believe you would hurt the poor.

979
01:21:15,670 --> 01:21:18,969
You'll try to persuade them.
That's all.

980
01:21:25,447 --> 01:21:27,381
But the problem is...

981
01:21:29,818 --> 01:21:32,252
persuasion doesn't always work.

982
01:21:34,289 --> 01:21:37,781
You need something more.
-- What do you need?

983
01:21:41,396 --> 01:21:44,559
-- Let's not talk about that.
-- l want to know.

984
01:21:45,934 --> 01:21:48,459
l don't want to talk
about mundane things with you.

985
01:21:48,570 --> 01:21:49,969
Why?

986
01:21:52,407 --> 01:21:55,604
l want no note of discord
in our relationship.

987
01:21:56,578 --> 01:21:59,138
But l'd be really happy to help.

988
01:22:00,849 --> 01:22:02,146
This is beyond you, queen bee.

989
01:22:03,251 --> 01:22:05,446
Haven't you seen me going beyond?

990
01:22:06,588 --> 01:22:11,048
l know how far you can go.
Even so, l'd rather not talk about it.

991
01:22:11,159 --> 01:22:12,888
lt's a personal request.

992
01:22:13,995 --> 01:22:19,194
Then there's no reason for me to stay.

993
01:22:19,968 --> 01:22:21,435
l'm leaving.

994
01:22:21,536 --> 01:22:25,438
Queen bee, please don't leave angry!

995
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:30,034
lf l can't help you with Swadeshi,
then l'm just wasting my time here.

996
01:22:30,145 --> 01:22:32,613
l just didn't want you to worry about me.

997
01:22:33,248 --> 01:22:35,944
Must we only talk about politics?

998
01:22:36,051 --> 01:22:37,518
Only about my work?

999
01:22:38,119 --> 01:22:41,577
Promise me you'll tell me
if you need money,

1000
01:22:41,690 --> 01:22:44,659
and you'll take it if l give it to you.

1001
01:22:45,293 --> 01:22:46,817
l promise, queen bee.

1002
01:22:47,462 --> 01:22:49,225
l promise.

1003
01:22:49,497 --> 01:22:50,964
Queen bee?

1004
01:22:51,633 --> 01:22:54,500
l'll come again this evening.
Please wait for me here.

1005
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:57,461
l hate having to send for you every time.

1006
01:22:58,006 --> 01:22:59,598
Let go of me.

1007
01:22:59,708 --> 01:23:03,769
Promise me you'll come to me every day.

1008
01:23:04,746 --> 01:23:07,544
l must see you at least once a day.

1009
01:23:08,817 --> 01:23:11,149
There's nothing wrong with that.

1010
01:23:11,453 --> 01:23:13,785
Promise me.

1011
01:23:13,888 --> 01:23:15,583
All right.

1012
01:23:17,392 --> 01:23:21,488
Please let go of my hand.
l want to go.

1013
01:23:45,286 --> 01:23:47,754
Khemi, clean the room later.

1014
01:25:03,364 --> 01:25:08,996
<i>GentIy she waIks,</i>
<i>the beauteous one</i>

1015
01:25:15,577 --> 01:25:17,636
Back so soon?

1016
01:25:21,883 --> 01:25:23,646
What are you staring at?

1017
01:25:25,854 --> 01:25:27,947
What is there to stare at but you?

1018
01:25:29,057 --> 01:25:31,252
l've never seen anything like it.

1019
01:25:32,527 --> 01:25:34,461
Such tender concern for our guest.

1020
01:25:34,896 --> 01:25:37,262
He'll never want to leave.

1021
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:43,494
ln my day, we had to look
after our husbands too.

1022
01:25:45,940 --> 01:25:50,001
lf only my brother--in--law
were a guest in his own house,

1023
01:25:50,712 --> 01:25:52,543
he'd be warmly welcomed.

1024
01:25:52,647 --> 01:25:55,616
l don't want any advice from you.

1025
01:26:01,055 --> 01:26:04,218
l was just a small girl
when l came here as a bride.

1026
01:26:04,993 --> 01:26:09,555
Your husband was
my playmate in those days.

1027
01:26:11,466 --> 01:26:13,161
Where were you then?

1028
01:26:13,268 --> 01:26:16,396
There's no need to repeat
what l already know.

1029
01:26:21,409 --> 01:26:23,877
He was the only one
who understood my pain.

1030
01:26:23,978 --> 01:26:25,536
He used to say,

1031
01:26:26,247 --> 01:26:28,909
''We're still living in the Dark Ages.

1032
01:26:29,584 --> 01:26:31,677
That's why you're suffering like this.

1033
01:26:33,354 --> 01:26:37,381
For you, having a husband
is just as painful as losing one.''

1034
01:26:37,892 --> 01:26:42,955
''My wife will be a free woman,'' he'd say.

1035
01:26:46,167 --> 01:26:49,136
Well, now l see that free woman
before my very eyes.

1036
01:26:53,408 --> 01:26:55,569
But don't forget,

1037
01:26:56,578 --> 01:26:58,603
there's a God above us, dear sister.

1038
01:26:59,147 --> 01:27:02,605
He can see you too.

1039
01:27:15,930 --> 01:27:18,364
<i>I beIieved I had the strength to bear</i>

1040
01:27:19,033 --> 01:27:24,130
<i>whatever misfortune</i>
<i>fate had in store for me.</i>

1041
01:27:24,606 --> 01:27:30,135
<i>I wouId caII up visions of suffering</i>
<i>and steeI myseIf against them.</i>

1042
01:27:30,912 --> 01:27:32,880
<i>Visions of poverty,</i>

1043
01:27:32,981 --> 01:27:36,815
<i>dishonor or death.</i>

1044
01:27:37,518 --> 01:27:41,045
<i>I even imagined BimaIa's death.</i>

1045
01:27:42,223 --> 01:27:45,681
<i>But there was one thing</i>
<i>I couId never imagine happening.</i>

1046
01:27:46,861 --> 01:27:50,820
<i>Now I keep asking myseIf</i>
<i>again and again.</i>

1047
01:27:51,799 --> 01:27:53,960
<i>Do I have the strength to bear this?</i>

1048
01:27:55,236 --> 01:27:59,502
-- Hail Motherland!
-- Hail Motherland!

1049
01:28:19,594 --> 01:28:24,122
-- What do you want?
-- We have some questions.

1050
01:28:24,232 --> 01:28:25,392
What are they?

1051
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:28,731
Why don't you ban
foreign goods in our market?

1052
01:28:28,836 --> 01:28:31,999
-- l have my reasons.
-- ls it because you would lose money?

1053
01:28:34,375 --> 01:28:38,607
l wouldn't, but the poor would.

1054
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:40,709
But our nation will profit.

1055
01:28:40,815 --> 01:28:44,808
We buy domestic salt, sugar and clothing.

1056
01:28:44,919 --> 01:28:46,614
How can you say that?

1057
01:28:47,422 --> 01:28:50,050
How can you compare
yourselves with the poor?

1058
01:28:50,525 --> 01:28:52,459
You have money.

1059
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:55,552
You can afford
to spend more on lndian goods.

1060
01:28:57,098 --> 01:28:59,566
The poor aren't standing in your way.

1061
01:29:00,234 --> 01:29:01,599
Why are you standing in theirs?

1062
01:29:02,003 --> 01:29:04,972
You want to oppose an entire nation
that's taken the Swadeshi oath?

1063
01:29:05,073 --> 01:29:05,869
Never.

1064
01:29:06,908 --> 01:29:08,808
That's beyond my power.

1065
01:29:09,510 --> 01:29:12,741
But how can you say
the entire nation has taken your oath?

1066
01:29:13,548 --> 01:29:15,311
Look at the evidence.

1067
01:29:15,416 --> 01:29:17,816
Aren't the traders part of this nation?

1068
01:29:17,919 --> 01:29:21,184
So you won't ban foreign goods?

1069
01:29:22,790 --> 01:29:24,189
No,

1070
01:29:24,692 --> 01:29:27,525
because those goods don't belong to me.

1071
01:29:27,628 --> 01:29:29,323
Hail Motherland!

1072
01:29:51,219 --> 01:29:52,618
What are you looking for?

1073
01:29:53,988 --> 01:29:55,717
<i>PassifIora.</i>

1074
01:29:57,091 --> 01:29:59,025
Didn't you have a vial?

1075
01:30:00,762 --> 01:30:02,696
Are you having trouble sleeping?

1076
01:30:04,465 --> 01:30:07,901
One sleeps less as one grows older,

1077
01:30:08,836 --> 01:30:11,100
but these last three nights --

1078
01:30:11,205 --> 01:30:13,366
Here it is.

1079
01:30:13,474 --> 01:30:14,702
l found it.

1080
01:30:14,809 --> 01:30:16,538
Please, keep the vial.

1081
01:30:27,121 --> 01:30:29,555
l don't like this, Nikhil.

1082
01:30:30,925 --> 01:30:37,524
l have grave misgivings
about the way things are shaping up.

1083
01:30:38,332 --> 01:30:42,234
Sandip is your friend and your guest.

1084
01:30:42,904 --> 01:30:45,304
Everybody knows that.

1085
01:30:45,673 --> 01:30:50,042
Soon they'll believe whatever he does
is done with your sanction.

1086
01:30:50,878 --> 01:30:56,180
Don't you realize how terrible
the consequences could be for you?

1087
01:30:58,286 --> 01:31:00,880
l'm already feeling those consequences, sir.

1088
01:31:01,989 --> 01:31:03,957
They think l'm a British lackey,

1089
01:31:04,792 --> 01:31:09,320
that l don't force Swadeshi on my tenants
for fear they would stop paying rent.

1090
01:31:09,430 --> 01:31:13,423
That's the propaganda.
-- Don't let it worry you.

1091
01:31:13,935 --> 01:31:18,963
Nothing can touch you as long as
you have a clear conscience.

1092
01:31:20,041 --> 01:31:23,772
But the situation is deteriorating.

1093
01:31:25,246 --> 01:31:30,878
Muslim preachers from Dhaka are
going around stirring up the peasants.

1094
01:31:31,419 --> 01:31:33,046
Have you heard about it?

1095
01:31:34,188 --> 01:31:36,088
l've read about it in the papers.

1096
01:31:36,190 --> 01:31:39,023
What's to stop them from coming here?

1097
01:31:39,961 --> 01:31:42,794
-- Nothing.
-- And then?

1098
01:31:44,699 --> 01:31:46,564
But if anything does happen,

1099
01:31:47,468 --> 01:31:51,802
can we place all the blame
on the preachers?

1100
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:54,767
We are also responsible.

1101
01:31:55,543 --> 01:31:57,636
How can we just ignore that?

1102
01:31:59,213 --> 01:32:02,376
Think about how we ourselves
have treated the poor Muslims.

1103
01:32:03,518 --> 01:32:07,716
Have we even respected
their rights as human beings?

1104
01:32:07,822 --> 01:32:11,417
That's true, but what
can be done about it now?

1105
01:32:15,029 --> 01:32:16,257
l'll go there.

1106
01:32:18,132 --> 01:32:20,362
l want to see for myself.

1107
01:32:21,536 --> 01:32:24,232
Rumors can be misleading.

1108
01:32:24,338 --> 01:32:28,001
Nikhil, can't you inform the magistrate?

1109
01:32:28,676 --> 01:32:31,270
l don't think he'd mind a riot.

1110
01:32:32,079 --> 01:32:34,377
lt's an easy way for him
to see the Swadeshi punished.

1111
01:32:34,482 --> 01:32:36,950
There is one thing you can do.

1112
01:32:38,953 --> 01:32:41,979
You can at least eradicate
the source of the trouble.

1113
01:32:42,857 --> 01:32:45,291
Why let Sandip stay?

1114
01:32:52,733 --> 01:32:55,600
l thought he'd leave of his own accord.

1115
01:32:58,573 --> 01:32:59,972
But now --

1116
01:33:00,675 --> 01:33:03,007
Leave? Why would he?

1117
01:33:04,145 --> 01:33:07,342
With all the comfort
and protection he enjoys here?

1118
01:33:07,782 --> 01:33:13,345
Besides, you've done him a special favor
by introducing him to your wife.

1119
01:33:13,454 --> 01:33:16,014
He's taking full advantage of that!

1120
01:33:16,524 --> 01:33:20,051
l had no idea he had changed so much.

1121
01:33:20,161 --> 01:33:25,793
All this adulation has gone to his head.

1122
01:33:27,768 --> 01:33:33,138
l think it comes from
a deep sense of frustration.

1123
01:33:34,575 --> 01:33:37,271
Despite all his gifts,

1124
01:33:38,145 --> 01:33:40,511
he hasn't really accomplished anything.

1125
01:33:42,283 --> 01:33:46,777
Sometimes, l feel pity for him.

1126
01:33:46,887 --> 01:33:49,685
This is no time for pity, Nikhil.

1127
01:33:50,391 --> 01:33:54,953
You can't bring yourself to be firm
with him because he's close to you.

1128
01:33:55,062 --> 01:33:57,030
You're hesitating.

1129
01:33:57,398 --> 01:34:01,960
But l fail to see why you're
vacillating at a time like this.

1130
01:34:02,970 --> 01:34:04,733
You would if l told you.

1131
01:34:06,607 --> 01:34:08,472
But l can't.

1132
01:36:57,778 --> 01:36:59,302
Remember this?

1133
01:37:07,621 --> 01:37:10,215
lt's from my soap factory.

1134
01:37:15,062 --> 01:37:18,554
You saved it?
-- Not just the soap.

1135
01:37:20,868 --> 01:37:24,599
Towels, pens, matches.
l kept everything.

1136
01:37:29,143 --> 01:37:30,667
Have you ever used it?

1137
01:37:34,114 --> 01:37:38,676
lt's no good for anything,
not even for washing clothes.

1138
01:37:44,792 --> 01:37:47,386
What foolish notions l had back then.

1139
01:37:47,494 --> 01:37:49,189
You still do.

1140
01:37:50,431 --> 01:37:54,458
You freed her from her moorings.
Now look where she's drifted.

1141
01:37:57,504 --> 01:38:01,099
-- That was no foolish notion.
-- You still think so?

1142
01:38:07,281 --> 01:38:09,977
lf she likes what she's doing,

1143
01:38:11,085 --> 01:38:13,178
then that's the kind of person she is.

1144
01:38:14,388 --> 01:38:16,652
l could prevent her from going out,

1145
01:38:17,424 --> 01:38:19,688
but that wouldn't change who she is.

1146
01:38:21,195 --> 01:38:22,958
She's not a child.

1147
01:38:23,497 --> 01:38:24,987
lsn't the husband the master?

1148
01:38:27,701 --> 01:38:30,397
Bending her to my will wouldn't be difficult,

1149
01:38:30,671 --> 01:38:31,968
but it wouldn't help.

1150
01:38:33,641 --> 01:38:35,666
At least get rid of him.

1151
01:38:36,810 --> 01:38:39,643
He's not much of a friend, is he?

1152
01:38:41,081 --> 01:38:46,041
lt would certainly be better for my estate

1153
01:38:46,987 --> 01:38:49,217
if he were to leave.

1154
01:38:50,457 --> 01:38:54,257
But l'm a selfish person.

1155
01:38:57,331 --> 01:39:00,789
l can't stop thinking about myself.
l just can't help it.

1156
01:39:02,436 --> 01:39:05,496
lf he leaves, you'll soon find her
back by your side.

1157
01:39:06,974 --> 01:39:08,464
l know.

1158
01:39:09,777 --> 01:39:14,976
But l would find her regretting it,

1159
01:39:16,317 --> 01:39:20,913
because it wouldn't be her decision.

1160
01:39:22,056 --> 01:39:24,081
That would be unbearable,

1161
01:39:25,326 --> 01:39:27,317
both for her...

1162
01:39:28,262 --> 01:39:30,753
and for me.

1163
01:39:35,135 --> 01:39:37,160
l can't do it.

1164
01:39:37,304 --> 01:39:39,602
Hail Motherland!

1165
01:40:28,288 --> 01:40:30,256
<i>HaiI MotherIand.</i>

1166
01:40:30,357 --> 01:40:32,052
What happened?

1167
01:40:32,159 --> 01:40:36,425
Why are you so late?
-- lt was a lot of work.

1168
01:40:37,197 --> 01:40:39,392
There's a play in Chandrapur tonight.

1169
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:42,230
l had to wait for the boatmen to go there.

1170
01:40:42,336 --> 01:40:46,067
This kind of work can't be done
if there are people around.

1171
01:40:46,173 --> 01:40:48,164
Mirjan's boat?

1172
01:40:51,478 --> 01:40:55,642
But when he comes back
and finds his boat missing,

1173
01:40:55,749 --> 01:40:57,683
it won't take him long
to put two and two together,

1174
01:40:57,785 --> 01:41:01,687
and then he'll come groveling to you.

1175
01:41:01,955 --> 01:41:06,016
You'll have to give him some compensation.

1176
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:11,329
Keep around 5,000 rupees handy.

1177
01:41:14,768 --> 01:41:17,794
-- Let me see.
-- A word of advice.

1178
01:41:19,106 --> 01:41:23,805
Can l be frank with you?

1179
01:41:23,911 --> 01:41:25,845
Out with it. lt's late.

1180
01:41:26,647 --> 01:41:32,176
l think you should finish things up
quickly here and leave.

1181
01:41:35,722 --> 01:41:39,089
-- Why?
-- Things aren't looking good.

1182
01:41:39,626 --> 01:41:41,594
There could be a riot.

1183
01:41:42,062 --> 01:41:43,723
You may be a leader,

1184
01:41:43,831 --> 01:41:48,700
but you're not exactly
a popular one, you know.

1185
01:41:49,136 --> 01:41:53,300
They're certainly not going
to put you on a pedestal.

1186
01:41:57,277 --> 01:42:00,075
l'll decide what to do.

1187
01:42:00,447 --> 01:42:03,041
You don't need to worry about it.

1188
01:42:07,387 --> 01:42:11,255
<i>Onward, sons of India</i>

1189
01:42:11,358 --> 01:42:15,124
<i>The MotherIand caIIs</i>

1190
01:42:15,229 --> 01:42:19,097
<i>Onward, sons of India</i>

1191
01:42:19,199 --> 01:42:22,828
<i>The MotherIand caIIs</i>

1192
01:42:22,936 --> 01:42:26,736
<i>The strong, the brave, the proud</i>

1193
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:30,674
<i>To serve the nation's cause</i>

1194
01:42:30,777 --> 01:42:34,474
<i>Onward, sons of India</i>

1195
01:42:34,581 --> 01:42:38,779
<i>The MotherIand caIIs</i>

1196
01:42:40,387 --> 01:42:42,821
You should give up Swadeshi
and take up singing.

1197
01:42:43,457 --> 01:42:48,690
l once considered becoming an actor.

1198
01:42:49,062 --> 01:42:52,691
lt's wonderful to be able to hold
a large audience in your grip.

1199
01:42:53,834 --> 01:42:57,565
l was thinking that when l heard
you speak the other evening.

1200
01:42:58,872 --> 01:43:00,567
Of course...

1201
01:43:01,008 --> 01:43:05,843
it's nothing like winning
the heart of a woman.

1202
01:43:07,614 --> 01:43:11,209
l gather you've won
the hearts of many women,

1203
01:43:11,785 --> 01:43:13,446
both Swadeshi...

1204
01:43:14,354 --> 01:43:15,753
and foreign.

1205
01:43:15,856 --> 01:43:17,619
Good God!

1206
01:43:17,891 --> 01:43:19,984
Has Nikhil told you all this?

1207
01:43:20,961 --> 01:43:23,191
You know so much about me.

1208
01:43:23,297 --> 01:43:25,265
Why shouldn't l know something about you?

1209
01:43:25,933 --> 01:43:28,026
You know what they were?

1210
01:43:28,135 --> 01:43:31,696
Youthful indiscretions.
lt's ancient history.

1211
01:43:32,439 --> 01:43:35,203
l wonder what happened to those women.

1212
01:43:35,742 --> 01:43:37,471
You shouldn't, queen bee.

1213
01:43:37,578 --> 01:43:41,207
l'm no longer the same person.
You know that.

1214
01:43:41,982 --> 01:43:44,780
Still, it's helpful in understanding
a person's character.

1215
01:43:45,586 --> 01:43:48,146
lt's not difficult to understand men.

1216
01:43:48,255 --> 01:43:50,189
lt's women who are unfathomable.

1217
01:43:50,657 --> 01:43:53,751
One despairs of knowing their minds.

1218
01:43:53,860 --> 01:43:57,057
You know that song, don't you?
-- What song?

1219
01:43:57,931 --> 01:44:03,870
<i>Who can ever fathom a woman's ways?</i>

1220
01:44:03,971 --> 01:44:07,407
<i>Who can ever fathom a woman's ways?</i>

1221
01:44:07,507 --> 01:44:10,738
<i>Her siIence means more</i>
<i>than what she says</i>

1222
01:44:10,844 --> 01:44:13,176
<i>She Iooks at you,</i>
<i>then drops her eyes</i>

1223
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:15,646
<i>Her siIence means more</i>
<i>than what she says</i>

1224
01:44:15,749 --> 01:44:18,115
<i>She Iooks at you,</i>
<i>then drops her eyes</i>

1225
01:44:18,218 --> 01:44:20,686
<i>She Iaughs one moment</i>
<i>The next she cries</i>

1226
01:44:21,688 --> 01:44:24,054
<i>She Iaughs one moment</i>
<i>The next she cries</i>

1227
01:44:24,157 --> 01:44:27,615
<i>She Iingers cIose,</i>
<i>then Ieaves you in a daze</i>

1228
01:44:27,728 --> 01:44:33,724
<i>Who can ever fathom a woman's ways?</i>

1229
01:44:33,834 --> 01:44:37,292
<i>Who can ever fathom a woman's ways?</i>

1230
01:44:37,904 --> 01:44:41,101
ls that why you never married?

1231
01:44:42,175 --> 01:44:47,374
How can l marry if l can't find a woman
after my own heart, queen bee?

1232
01:44:47,481 --> 01:44:50,746
l waited a long time for you last night.

1233
01:44:51,018 --> 01:44:52,815
You never came.

1234
01:44:55,255 --> 01:44:57,246
Forgive me, my queen bee.

1235
01:44:57,991 --> 01:45:00,983
l was very busy.
l got back late.

1236
01:45:01,094 --> 01:45:05,861
-- Busy with what?
-- The Swadeshi cause, of course.

1237
01:45:05,966 --> 01:45:09,060
-- Giving speeches?
-- No.

1238
01:45:09,169 --> 01:45:10,796
What, then?

1239
01:45:11,772 --> 01:45:14,297
Winding things up.

1240
01:45:15,409 --> 01:45:18,242
l can't stay here forever, you know.

1241
01:45:19,579 --> 01:45:22,047
We have to be constantly
on the move, campaigning.

1242
01:45:25,185 --> 01:45:27,380
You're leaving?

1243
01:45:29,256 --> 01:45:31,019
l have to go sooner or later.

1244
01:45:34,328 --> 01:45:36,796
What if your queen bee doesn't let you?

1245
01:45:40,567 --> 01:45:43,161
No one would be happier than me.

1246
01:45:43,603 --> 01:45:46,299
But l'm not planning on leaving just yet.

1247
01:45:46,406 --> 01:45:48,271
There are still problems to be resolved.

1248
01:45:49,910 --> 01:45:52,378
-- Will you tell me?
-- What?

1249
01:45:53,513 --> 01:45:55,071
How much money do you need?

1250
01:46:02,956 --> 01:46:04,514
What is it?

1251
01:46:05,759 --> 01:46:07,192
How much?

1252
01:46:08,028 --> 01:46:09,893
About five thousand.

1253
01:46:09,996 --> 01:46:12,464
We spent more
than we were planning to.

1254
01:46:12,566 --> 01:46:16,730
lf l get you the money,
you'll have to take it without question.

1255
01:46:18,171 --> 01:46:21,902
lf you say so, but you mustn't
part with your jewelry.

1256
01:46:23,043 --> 01:46:25,409
When l said money,
l meant money.

1257
01:46:28,582 --> 01:46:30,072
What if l can't repay you?

1258
01:46:31,017 --> 01:46:33,144
l don't expect you to.

1259
01:46:33,587 --> 01:46:36,385
Can't l at least do this much for Swadeshi?

1260
01:46:38,425 --> 01:46:41,553
-- l'm worried, queen bee.
-- Why?

1261
01:46:43,230 --> 01:46:45,994
l seem to have become a burden to you.

1262
01:46:46,099 --> 01:46:50,399
But there's no other way. l can explain.
-- You don't have to.

1263
01:46:50,837 --> 01:46:55,797
Just tell me one thing.
-- What?

1264
01:46:57,144 --> 01:47:01,308
-- lf l give you the money, will you stay?
-- Do you think l want to leave you?

1265
01:47:03,617 --> 01:47:06,279
Then why did you say
you were going to leave?

1266
01:47:06,553 --> 01:47:10,284
After all the torment l've been through.

1267
01:47:10,390 --> 01:47:13,188
l did it all for you,

1268
01:47:13,293 --> 01:47:15,557
and you --

1269
01:47:16,830 --> 01:47:18,229
Queen bee.

1270
01:48:08,315 --> 01:48:09,839
<i>Brothers!</i>

1271
01:48:10,650 --> 01:48:15,280
<i>The Hindus ask you to join hands</i>
<i>with them for the Swadeshi cause.</i>

1272
01:48:15,655 --> 01:48:18,055
<i>They wheedIe you.</i>

1273
01:48:18,325 --> 01:48:20,452
<i>They coax you.</i>

1274
01:48:20,560 --> 01:48:22,425
<i>They even threaten you.</i>

1275
01:48:22,529 --> 01:48:25,589
<i>They want you to join them at aII costs,</i>
<i>but don't Iisten to them, brothers.</i>

1276
01:48:25,699 --> 01:48:28,691
<i>Remember they don't want our betterment.</i>

1277
01:48:29,369 --> 01:48:33,897
<i>The Hindus don't care about your weII-being.</i>

1278
01:48:34,407 --> 01:48:40,004
<i>Whatever they say is not</i>
<i>for the benefit of our community.</i>

1279
01:48:40,113 --> 01:48:44,072
<i>The Hindus have never</i>
<i>cared about our weII-being.</i>

1280
01:48:44,184 --> 01:48:47,881
<i>The Hindus want to keep us MusIims</i>
<i>under their heeIs forever.</i>

1281
01:48:47,988 --> 01:48:51,389
<i>That is their onIy objective.</i>

1282
01:48:52,692 --> 01:48:55,855
<i>But remember one thing.</i>

1283
01:48:55,962 --> 01:49:01,093
<i>By the grace of AIIah,</i>
<i>MusIims are the majority in BengaI.</i>

1284
01:49:01,201 --> 01:49:03,328
<i>You are the farmers.</i>

1285
01:49:03,436 --> 01:49:07,463
<i>The weaIth of this country</i>
<i>comes from its Iand.</i>

1286
01:49:07,574 --> 01:49:09,565
<i>Enough is enough.</i>

1287
01:49:10,143 --> 01:49:14,807
<i>No part of this weaIth</i>
<i>is produced by the Hindus.</i>

1288
01:49:14,915 --> 01:49:18,783
<i>It's your hard work that made them weaIthy.</i>

1289
01:49:19,419 --> 01:49:24,516
<i>They have no right</i>
<i>to the fruits of your Iabors.</i>

1290
01:49:24,624 --> 01:49:26,785
This is your hard--earned money.

1291
01:49:26,893 --> 01:49:30,294
The Hindus have no right to it.

1292
01:49:31,097 --> 01:49:33,588
Listen to me, brother Muslims.

1293
01:49:34,334 --> 01:49:36,928
Don't listen to the Hindus.

1294
01:49:37,304 --> 01:49:40,034
Don't get mixed up in their politics.

1295
01:49:40,140 --> 01:49:41,937
Swadeshi is not for you.

1296
01:49:44,077 --> 01:49:48,605
You are the leaders
of the Hindu community in Sukhsayar.

1297
01:49:49,516 --> 01:49:53,885
l've called you here to tell you one thing.

1298
01:49:54,988 --> 01:49:59,015
You are men of wisdom
and good judgment.

1299
01:49:59,659 --> 01:50:02,560
l think you will appreciate
what l am going to say to you.

1300
01:50:03,163 --> 01:50:04,494
l have faith in you.

1301
01:50:05,632 --> 01:50:07,862
l just wanted to say...

1302
01:50:09,102 --> 01:50:12,333
that we can stay true
to our own religious beliefs,

1303
01:50:13,039 --> 01:50:15,735
but we shouldn't interfere
with the beliefs of others.

1304
01:50:17,110 --> 01:50:19,510
Even as a follower of <i>Vaishnavism,</i>

1305
01:50:20,113 --> 01:50:23,605
l can't prevent a follower of <i>Shaktism</i>
from spilling the blood of animals.

1306
01:50:24,417 --> 01:50:28,945
And so, similarly...

1307
01:50:29,389 --> 01:50:32,517
we should let the Muslims
follow their own religious convictions.

1308
01:50:32,626 --> 01:50:36,153
Maharaja, the Muslims in this village
never used to slaughter cows,

1309
01:50:36,262 --> 01:50:40,562
but l've heard they do now.

1310
01:50:40,667 --> 01:50:41,361
Yes.

1311
01:50:42,836 --> 01:50:44,861
l've heard that too.

1312
01:50:46,272 --> 01:50:50,902
But l strongly believe that
they've been manipulated into doing so.

1313
01:50:51,344 --> 01:50:53,403
They've been convinced to do it,

1314
01:50:53,980 --> 01:50:56,972
in order to stir up trouble
between our two religions.

1315
01:50:59,219 --> 01:51:01,619
Please don't add fuel to the fire.

1316
01:51:01,721 --> 01:51:04,747
They won't stop unless
you put them back in their place.

1317
01:51:04,858 --> 01:51:06,758
The good old days are gone.

1318
01:51:08,094 --> 01:51:09,527
Listen.

1319
01:51:10,897 --> 01:51:13,365
Muslims are a part of lndia.

1320
01:51:14,300 --> 01:51:17,701
This is a historical fact.

1321
01:51:19,205 --> 01:51:21,730
You must accept this fact.

1322
01:51:23,610 --> 01:51:28,445
We can't imagine an lndia without Muslims.

1323
01:51:29,916 --> 01:51:31,816
lf we try to put them in their place,

1324
01:51:32,318 --> 01:51:35,116
it won't stop them from slaughtering cows.

1325
01:51:35,789 --> 01:51:38,485
lt may even lead to them slaughtering men.

1326
01:51:41,461 --> 01:51:47,525
That's never been truer than now,
in the present state of unrest and turmoil.

1327
01:51:48,935 --> 01:51:55,602
You now have a grave responsibility.

1328
01:51:59,713 --> 01:52:04,377
l beg you, l beseech you,

1329
01:52:05,852 --> 01:52:08,685
do not encourage hatred.

1330
01:52:10,190 --> 01:52:15,822
lf you do so now,
you are courting disaster.

1331
01:52:30,844 --> 01:52:32,835
Hail Motherland.

1332
01:53:10,650 --> 01:53:12,140
Nikhil.

1333
01:53:12,252 --> 01:53:15,585
Did you hear a shot?
-- Yes, l did.

1334
01:53:16,656 --> 01:53:18,123
-- What now?
-- l know.

1335
01:53:20,160 --> 01:53:22,355
l know what must be done.

1336
01:53:22,629 --> 01:53:24,221
But first of all,

1337
01:53:24,330 --> 01:53:28,232
take my carriage, go home
and come back with all your belongings.

1338
01:53:28,535 --> 01:53:31,504
The roads aren't safe anymore.
l don't want anything to happen to you.

1339
01:53:32,539 --> 01:53:34,564
That sounds fine, but --

1340
01:53:36,176 --> 01:53:38,804
l'll tell Sandip right away.

1341
01:54:09,142 --> 01:54:10,905
Time's running out, queen bee.

1342
01:54:11,010 --> 01:54:13,035
l need the money now.

1343
01:54:21,287 --> 01:54:22,914
What's that?

1344
01:54:23,022 --> 01:54:24,649
Can't you guess?

1345
01:54:25,925 --> 01:54:27,415
Money?

1346
01:54:27,927 --> 01:54:31,454
So little? There can't be
more than 500 in those bags.

1347
01:54:32,098 --> 01:54:35,465
You must have forgotten.
l asked for 5,000 rupees.

1348
01:54:41,274 --> 01:54:42,866
What's this?

1349
01:54:44,177 --> 01:54:45,371
Gold coins?

1350
01:54:54,654 --> 01:54:55,985
Gold.

1351
01:54:58,424 --> 01:55:00,654
Gold.

1352
01:55:04,063 --> 01:55:06,327
You should have told me.

1353
01:55:07,233 --> 01:55:09,360
How else would l know?

1354
01:55:11,871 --> 01:55:13,862
Please don't be angry, my queen bee.

1355
01:55:20,780 --> 01:55:24,045
-- l need to talk to you.
-- About what?

1356
01:55:24,884 --> 01:55:27,512
l don't want you to stay here any longer.

1357
01:55:27,620 --> 01:55:29,713
Things have taken a serious turn.

1358
01:55:29,822 --> 01:55:32,450
Your presence may make matters worse.

1359
01:55:33,559 --> 01:55:35,925
l want you to leave Sukhsayar
by tomorrow morning.

1360
01:55:38,064 --> 01:55:40,760
Am l supposed to take orders from you?

1361
01:55:40,867 --> 01:55:42,334
lt's not that.

1362
01:55:43,736 --> 01:55:46,603
lf you leave for Calcutta,
it will be good for you,

1363
01:55:47,507 --> 01:55:48,974
and for Sukhsayar as well.

1364
01:55:50,209 --> 01:55:53,667
-- l have no work to do in Calcutta.
-- All the more reason to go.

1365
01:55:54,714 --> 01:55:57,274
You've done too much work here.

1366
01:55:59,085 --> 01:56:01,883
Don't think l haven't been
informed of your activities.

1367
01:56:02,722 --> 01:56:05,657
From setting fire to the peasants' barns
to sinking Mirjan's boat,

1368
01:56:06,626 --> 01:56:09,220
l've been informed of everything.

1369
01:56:10,496 --> 01:56:13,329
You speak of unity
between Hindus and Muslims,

1370
01:56:14,067 --> 01:56:17,002
but, in fact, you oppress Muslims.

1371
01:56:18,504 --> 01:56:20,734
l won't tolerate it anymore.

1372
01:56:23,076 --> 01:56:25,567
l may not believe in Swadeshi,

1373
01:56:26,579 --> 01:56:29,241
but l truly admire
some Swadeshi leaders.

1374
01:56:30,350 --> 01:56:35,652
But l don't admire those
whose actions belie their words.

1375
01:56:36,889 --> 01:56:39,483
You're not saving the country.
You're ruining it.

1376
01:56:40,727 --> 01:56:43,696
l won't allow this to go on in my estate.

1377
01:56:43,796 --> 01:56:47,425
There's only one person here
l'm prepared to obey.

1378
01:56:49,702 --> 01:56:51,533
Queen bee...

1379
01:56:52,038 --> 01:56:55,303
Do you want me to stay or not?

1380
01:57:04,150 --> 01:57:05,674
Queen bee.

1381
01:57:06,719 --> 01:57:09,017
l'm waiting for your answer.

1382
01:57:10,656 --> 01:57:13,489
Do you want me to leave?

1383
01:57:16,129 --> 01:57:18,097
Please tell me, queen bee.

1384
01:57:19,632 --> 01:57:21,566
l've said what l came to say.

1385
01:57:24,170 --> 01:57:26,536
l hope l won't have to repeat it.

1386
01:57:31,144 --> 01:57:32,975
Queen bee.

1387
01:57:35,248 --> 01:57:37,375
What's the matter with you?

1388
01:57:41,120 --> 01:57:44,021
You suddenly --
-- ls Amulya in your room?

1389
01:57:44,123 --> 01:57:45,988
-- Amulya?
-- Yes.

1390
01:57:46,092 --> 01:57:47,116
Why?

1391
01:57:47,226 --> 01:57:50,127
Send him to me. lt's urgent.

1392
01:57:50,830 --> 01:57:53,458
Can't you tell me why?

1393
01:57:53,766 --> 01:57:55,825
No, l'll tell Amulya.

1394
01:57:55,935 --> 01:57:57,903
Please send him to me.

1395
01:57:58,004 --> 01:58:00,063
lt's my request.

1396
01:58:01,274 --> 01:58:03,003
Very well.

1397
01:59:39,639 --> 01:59:41,038
Amulya?

1398
01:59:43,476 --> 01:59:46,673
Can you do me a favor?
-- Of course. What is it?

1399
01:59:46,779 --> 01:59:48,076
Go to Calcutta.

1400
01:59:48,181 --> 01:59:50,979
You can take the morning train
and return in the evening.

1401
01:59:51,083 --> 01:59:53,210
The money for the journey is in this box.

1402
01:59:53,319 --> 01:59:56,379
-- What's this box?
-- lt's my jewelry box.

1403
01:59:56,489 --> 02:00:00,152
l need 5,000 rupees. Sell some
of my jewelry and bring me the money.

1404
02:00:00,259 --> 02:00:02,352
l don't need any jewelry.
l can get you the money.

1405
02:00:02,461 --> 02:00:03,792
How?

1406
02:00:03,896 --> 02:00:06,831
This is not a small amount
we're talking about.

1407
02:00:06,933 --> 02:00:08,298
l'll get it.

1408
02:00:08,401 --> 02:00:10,528
No, do as l tell you.

1409
02:00:11,137 --> 02:00:14,106
But why did you give
Mr. Sandip 5,000 rupees?

1410
02:00:14,207 --> 02:00:16,072
He said he needed that much.

1411
02:00:16,175 --> 02:00:19,872
No, according to our calculations,
we only needed 3,500.

1412
02:00:19,979 --> 02:00:22,379
lf you give him more,
he spends it on himself.

1413
02:00:23,149 --> 02:00:26,949
He's quite a spender.
He always travels first--class.

1414
02:00:28,054 --> 02:00:30,113
-- Sandip?
-- Yes, sister.

1415
02:00:30,223 --> 02:00:34,091
He says hardship saps a leader's strength.

1416
02:00:34,927 --> 02:00:38,192
Well, l can't take back
what l've already given.

1417
02:00:38,297 --> 02:00:41,130
He might need it in the future.
You get me the 5,000.

1418
02:00:41,734 --> 02:00:45,101
Put the box away.
l'll get you the money tonight.

1419
02:00:45,204 --> 02:00:47,138
-- How?
-- From the treasury.

1420
02:00:48,140 --> 02:00:51,439
Are you insane?
What about the guards?

1421
02:00:51,544 --> 02:00:53,569
We carry weapons, sister.

1422
02:01:01,520 --> 02:01:03,681
Good heavens!

1423
02:01:04,390 --> 02:01:06,449
Why are you upset, sister?

1424
02:01:06,559 --> 02:01:08,652
We need funding
to carry out our work for the nation.

1425
02:01:09,996 --> 02:01:11,964
Doesn't it bother you that you're stealing?

1426
02:01:12,064 --> 02:01:13,964
Why?
Whose money is it?

1427
02:01:14,066 --> 02:01:16,933
Mine today,
the moneylender's tomorrow.

1428
02:01:17,036 --> 02:01:20,665
Why not use it for the cause?
-- No, Amulya.

1429
02:01:20,773 --> 02:01:25,073
lf you go robbing treasuries,
l'll die of fear.

1430
02:01:25,177 --> 02:01:27,441
Listen, you may not need
to sell all the jewelry.

1431
02:01:27,546 --> 02:01:31,573
Sell as much as you need to
and bring back the rest.

1432
02:01:32,585 --> 02:01:35,486
Take the box and carry it safely.

1433
02:01:35,588 --> 02:01:38,489
And be careful, for heaven's sake.

1434
02:01:39,425 --> 02:01:40,892
Very well, sister.

1435
02:01:44,797 --> 02:01:47,163
l'll take my leave.
-- Okay.

1436
02:02:11,190 --> 02:02:12,953
<i>Queen bee.</i>

1437
02:02:22,635 --> 02:02:24,364
Are you leaving?

1438
02:02:24,470 --> 02:02:26,734
ls there any reason for me to stay?

1439
02:02:26,839 --> 02:02:28,830
Why do you say that?

1440
02:02:28,941 --> 02:02:31,569
Can't you hear the note of discord?

1441
02:02:32,611 --> 02:02:35,944
lf l've done anything wrong,
please forgive me.

1442
02:02:36,048 --> 02:02:38,016
Don't leave like this.

1443
02:02:38,551 --> 02:02:43,250
My husband said, ''The less one
knows you, the better one likes you''.

1444
02:02:43,923 --> 02:02:46,687
Perhaps l know you too well.

1445
02:02:46,792 --> 02:02:48,692
Don't say that, queen bee.

1446
02:02:49,128 --> 02:02:51,858
Has knowing me meant nothing to you?

1447
02:02:52,131 --> 02:02:54,031
Has it all been in vain?

1448
02:02:54,133 --> 02:02:57,330
l believed you would
succeed in your endeavor.

1449
02:02:57,436 --> 02:02:59,336
l wanted you to.

1450
02:02:59,438 --> 02:03:01,702
But not anymore?

1451
02:03:27,767 --> 02:03:30,361
<i>AIIah is great!</i>

1452
02:04:24,457 --> 02:04:26,425
Kasim?

1453
02:04:33,365 --> 02:04:34,832
Hands up.

1454
02:04:37,703 --> 02:04:39,227
Hands up.

1455
02:04:41,540 --> 02:04:42,734
Go inside.

1456
02:04:42,842 --> 02:04:44,002
Go inside!

1457
02:04:50,549 --> 02:04:51,743
Move.

1458
02:04:54,220 --> 02:04:55,653
Turn around.

1459
02:04:56,555 --> 02:04:58,147
Turn!

1460
02:05:02,127 --> 02:05:04,061
Now open the safe.

1461
02:05:04,730 --> 02:05:06,197
Open it!

1462
02:05:11,237 --> 02:05:14,365
Take out 3,500 rupees.

1463
02:05:15,140 --> 02:05:18,473
What's going on?
What's all the commotion?

1464
02:05:18,744 --> 02:05:20,837
ls there a problem?

1465
02:05:22,147 --> 02:05:23,876
l don't know.

1466
02:05:24,550 --> 02:05:26,142
l hope it's not a riot.

1467
02:05:26,252 --> 02:05:28,243
What are you saying?

1468
02:05:28,587 --> 02:05:31,750
What will happen to us
if there's a riot here?

1469
02:05:33,292 --> 02:05:35,487
We're going to Calcutta tomorrow.

1470
02:05:36,328 --> 02:05:37,955
lt's no longer safe here.

1471
02:05:38,063 --> 02:05:40,861
Who is ''we''?
Am l not coming with you?

1472
02:05:43,636 --> 02:05:45,536
Did l say that?

1473
02:05:47,640 --> 02:05:49,505
l'm so relieved.

1474
02:05:49,608 --> 02:05:51,735
A treasury was looted nearby.

1475
02:05:51,844 --> 02:05:54,711
What's to stop them from looting this place?

1476
02:05:54,813 --> 02:05:58,476
lf they kill me, they'll burn my body
by that shriveled banyan tree.

1477
02:05:58,584 --> 02:06:00,142
That would be awful.

1478
02:06:02,087 --> 02:06:03,884
Go and get ready.

1479
02:06:03,989 --> 02:06:05,820
Pack your things.

1480
02:06:07,560 --> 02:06:09,824
You're serious about leaving, aren't you?

1481
02:06:10,429 --> 02:06:12,454
l'm always serious.

1482
02:06:13,499 --> 02:06:15,467
Don't you know me by now?

1483
02:06:39,758 --> 02:06:41,453
Bimala?

1484
02:06:44,263 --> 02:06:46,231
l have to tell you something.

1485
02:06:46,332 --> 02:06:47,924
What is it?

1486
02:06:48,200 --> 02:06:52,660
There were 5,000 rupees
in gold coins in two bags in the safe.

1487
02:06:52,938 --> 02:06:54,872
l gave them to Sandip.

1488
02:06:55,474 --> 02:06:57,408
He needed the money.

1489
02:06:58,210 --> 02:07:02,112
Now you know how hard
it is to refuse him.

1490
02:07:02,214 --> 02:07:03,613
l'll pay the money back.

1491
02:07:04,116 --> 02:07:05,981
l gave Amulya my jewelry box.

1492
02:07:06,085 --> 02:07:08,144
He'll sell my jewels and bring the money.

1493
02:07:13,859 --> 02:07:19,058
l felt bad speaking to Sandip
like that in front of you.

1494
02:07:21,500 --> 02:07:23,593
But l had to, Bimala.

1495
02:07:24,603 --> 02:07:25,968
Things have taken a bad turn.

1496
02:07:30,976 --> 02:07:33,911
lt's no longer safe for him to work here.

1497
02:07:34,847 --> 02:07:37,372
But what about you?

1498
02:07:41,086 --> 02:07:43,850
Your safety is what concerns me.

1499
02:07:44,256 --> 02:07:47,851
No one else matters to me anymore.

1500
02:07:48,661 --> 02:07:51,858
Tomorrow, we're going to Calcutta.

1501
02:07:52,431 --> 02:07:54,160
All three of us.

1502
02:07:55,200 --> 02:07:57,725
And if something happens before then?

1503
02:08:00,673 --> 02:08:02,231
You won't leave the house, will you?

1504
02:08:05,344 --> 02:08:08,871
lf something happens,
l'll have to go and intervene, Bimala.

1505
02:08:13,686 --> 02:08:15,244
l knew it.

1506
02:08:17,623 --> 02:08:20,854
l knew l'd be punished.

1507
02:08:21,960 --> 02:08:24,394
l'll be punished.

1508
02:08:27,566 --> 02:08:29,431
Punished? Why, Bimala?

1509
02:08:30,302 --> 02:08:32,862
You haven't done anything wrong.

1510
02:08:34,406 --> 02:08:39,275
l don't even have the right
to ask you for forgiveness.

1511
02:08:41,513 --> 02:08:45,040
But you've come back to me,
haven't you?

1512
02:08:46,285 --> 02:08:48,583
Haven't you, Bimala?

1513
02:08:56,829 --> 02:09:01,528
lt seems like ages since l last
looked at you and spoke to you.

1514
02:09:03,502 --> 02:09:05,595
What came over me?

1515
02:09:06,338 --> 02:09:08,863
Why did this happen?

1516
02:09:10,709 --> 02:09:12,506
You've done nothing wrong, Bimala.

1517
02:09:13,545 --> 02:09:16,878
For ten years, you never saw
another man besides me.

1518
02:09:18,784 --> 02:09:20,775
Don't forget that.

1519
02:09:52,851 --> 02:09:55,046
There's 3,500 rupees here.

1520
02:09:55,954 --> 02:09:59,185
Please return the jewelry box
and the gold coins.

1521
02:10:00,459 --> 02:10:03,792
Where did you get that money?
Where have you been?

1522
02:10:04,696 --> 02:10:06,687
To the treasury.

1523
02:10:07,800 --> 02:10:09,028
l hope nobody saw you.

1524
02:10:17,276 --> 02:10:19,141
l had my face covered.

1525
02:10:19,478 --> 02:10:22,413
Did you see any trouble in the village?
-- There's a riot.

1526
02:10:24,516 --> 02:10:27,713
The Muslims have broken
into the temple of Visalakshi.

1527
02:10:38,197 --> 02:10:39,960
Are you leaving?

1528
02:10:41,567 --> 02:10:43,194
Yes. To Rangpur.

1529
02:10:48,540 --> 02:10:49,734
Will you come with me?

1530
02:11:03,422 --> 02:11:04,821
l must go now.

1531
02:11:13,098 --> 02:11:14,725
Hail Motherland.

1532
02:11:31,283 --> 02:11:32,841
What are you thinking?

1533
02:11:34,086 --> 02:11:35,747
Nothing.

1534
02:11:37,422 --> 02:11:39,890
l don't want to think.

1535
02:11:41,093 --> 02:11:43,186
l want to forget.

1536
02:11:44,763 --> 02:11:47,926
Everything that's happened
in the last few days.

1537
02:11:48,400 --> 02:11:51,301
Forget? But why?

1538
02:11:51,403 --> 02:11:52,165
Nikhil!

1539
02:11:55,707 --> 02:11:57,698
Come in, Sandip.

1540
02:12:00,879 --> 02:12:03,109
This is the age of breaking rules.

1541
02:12:03,849 --> 02:12:06,044
Your wife came out of her confinement,

1542
02:12:06,151 --> 02:12:08,051
and now l've invaded
the privacy of your bedroom.

1543
02:12:08,153 --> 02:12:10,087
l hope you'll forgive me.

1544
02:12:12,557 --> 02:12:16,653
These are your property,
which l duly return.

1545
02:12:17,429 --> 02:12:20,296
One jewelry box
and two bags of gold coins.

1546
02:12:21,300 --> 02:12:22,767
The jewelry box?

1547
02:12:23,535 --> 02:12:27,301
Your devotee didn't take it with him,
but he brought me the money.

1548
02:12:30,709 --> 02:12:35,646
Since you have your valuables, l hope
you won't mind me keeping the money.

1549
02:12:35,747 --> 02:12:38,045
-- Are you leaving?
-- Yes, Nikhil.

1550
02:12:39,017 --> 02:12:41,645
The train to Rangpur leaves in an hour.

1551
02:12:43,855 --> 02:12:47,154
Do you hear that?
The riots have started.

1552
02:12:47,259 --> 02:12:48,988
Amulya saw them.

1553
02:12:49,294 --> 02:12:53,890
And now l must make
my proverbial escape.

1554
02:12:54,199 --> 02:12:55,530
l must live.

1555
02:12:56,301 --> 02:12:58,531
l have a lot of work left to do.

1556
02:12:58,804 --> 02:13:01,329
Don't make the same mistake again.

1557
02:13:01,440 --> 02:13:03,704
Can't you see the results of your actions?

1558
02:13:04,676 --> 02:13:06,871
l follow the <i>Bhagavadgita,</i> Nikhil.

1559
02:13:07,145 --> 02:13:11,081
l am concerned only
with the action, not the result.

1560
02:13:11,183 --> 02:13:15,483
And l consider Ravana to be
the hero of Ramayana, not Rama.

1561
02:13:15,587 --> 02:13:18,522
So l can't accept advice
from the followers of Rama.

1562
02:13:19,658 --> 02:13:21,558
The easy road isn't for me, Nikhil.

1563
02:13:23,228 --> 02:13:24,923
l'll take my leave.

1564
02:13:30,302 --> 02:13:32,395
This will stay with me.

1565
02:13:37,709 --> 02:13:39,700
l'm keeping this as a memento.

1566
02:13:40,712 --> 02:13:43,044
Who knows if we'll ever meet again?
