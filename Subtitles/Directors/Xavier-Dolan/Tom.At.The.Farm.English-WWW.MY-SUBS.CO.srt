1
00:00:33,576 --> 00:00:35,245
<i>Today...</i>

2
00:00:46,214 --> 00:00:49,050
<i>... a part of me...</i>

3
00:00:54,013 --> 00:00:55,640
<i>... has died...</i>

4
00:00:56,224 --> 00:00:58,643
<i>... and I cannot...</i>

5
00:01:03,022 --> 00:01:05,483
<i>... cry.</i>

6
00:01:09,028 --> 00:01:11,489
<i>For I've forgotten...</i>

7
00:01:14,451 --> 00:01:16,661
<i>... all synonyms for...</i>

8
00:01:22,292 --> 00:01:24,043
<i>"sadness."</i>

9
00:01:26,254 --> 00:01:27,881
<i>Now...</i>

10
00:01:33,636 --> 00:01:36,514
<i>... all I can do...</i>

11
00:01:38,016 --> 00:01:40,059
<i>... without you...</i>

12
00:01:41,853 --> 00:01:44,522
<i>... is replace you.</i>

13
00:01:48,067 --> 00:01:49,652
Fuck this.

14
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:05,760
Is anyone here?

15
00:07:20,983 --> 00:07:22,235
Jesus...

16
00:08:57,914 --> 00:08:59,332
Son of a bitch.

17
00:09:05,004 --> 00:09:08,925
Tom at the Farm

18
00:09:25,942 --> 00:09:28,110
Sir, why are you in my house?

19
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:31,155
Sorry.

20
00:09:31,614 --> 00:09:32,990
Sorry...

21
00:09:33,824 --> 00:09:36,786
All I had was your address, so...

22
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:41,582
Tom.

23
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,001
I'm Tom.

24
00:09:45,044 --> 00:09:47,713
Sorry about the mess.
It's been hell around here.

25
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:49,382
- It's ok.
- Just so sudden.

26
00:09:59,976 --> 00:10:01,519
I couldn't find a hotel--

27
00:10:01,644 --> 00:10:05,189
Hotels aren't exactly
this town's specialty.

28
00:10:07,775 --> 00:10:09,694
Fine black car you got there.

29
00:10:14,365 --> 00:10:15,408
Thanks.

30
00:10:21,497 --> 00:10:22,832
Ma'am...

31
00:10:25,001 --> 00:10:27,837
I should've started with that.
I forgot.

32
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:30,047
My condolences.

33
00:10:32,174 --> 00:10:33,759
My condolences.

34
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:35,219
Call me Agathe.

35
00:10:38,806 --> 00:10:41,559
No friends called.
Figured he didn't have any.

36
00:10:41,684 --> 00:10:44,437
Smart guy like him...
Bet they all envied him.

37
00:10:50,818 --> 00:10:54,572
Don't you say you're leaving tomorrow.
He always said that.

38
00:10:54,697 --> 00:10:56,240
You'll stay.

39
00:11:00,202 --> 00:11:02,663
And say something at the funeral?

40
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:05,791
Yes, I wrote...

41
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,168
a few words...

42
00:11:07,293 --> 00:11:09,795
However, it's a little informal, humble.

43
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,467
You talk good. If you speak,
they'll know my son was a good boy.

44
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:16,594
You'll sleep in his bed.

45
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,598
It's clean. Every month, I wash the sheets.

46
00:11:20,723 --> 00:11:22,475
I dunno why, but I do.

47
00:11:29,148 --> 00:11:30,816
A whole trout's plenty, huh?

48
00:11:31,317 --> 00:11:32,401
Sure.

49
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:34,278
His brother caught them.

50
00:11:35,446 --> 00:11:37,239
- Who?
- His brother.

51
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:39,700
I'm knee-deep in fish, here.

52
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:43,704
Would you get me a stick of butter
from the fridge downstairs?

53
00:11:44,455 --> 00:11:46,499
Sure. Of course.

54
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,538
You look like him. The eyes.

55
00:12:26,205 --> 00:12:28,749
It's funny. Well, not funny, but...

56
00:12:35,131 --> 00:12:37,341
I didn't know he had a brother.

57
00:12:41,303 --> 00:12:42,972
Of course. Francis.

58
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:47,768
He runs the farm,
since my husband passed.

59
00:12:53,274 --> 00:12:54,358
So...

60
00:12:54,817 --> 00:12:56,777
What do you do?

61
00:12:59,864 --> 00:13:03,075
I'm an editor for an ad agency.

62
00:13:06,162 --> 00:13:07,788
We worked together.

63
00:13:09,081 --> 00:13:11,792
We were... co-workers.

64
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:14,795
Friends... Comrades...

65
00:13:21,552 --> 00:13:23,429
When I saw you, I didn't scream.

66
00:13:23,846 --> 00:13:25,931
I could've.
- Sorry--

67
00:13:26,056 --> 00:13:29,226
A woman comes home
to a stranger, y'know?

68
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:35,816
The only person who should've come didn't.

69
00:13:36,609 --> 00:13:39,570
Is that what people do these days?
Is that... trendy?

70
00:13:46,952 --> 00:13:48,120
Who is...

71
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:49,330
...this person?

72
00:13:49,872 --> 00:13:51,040
Never mind.

73
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:58,255
You're wearing his cologne, aren't you?

74
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,428
Smells nice.

75
00:14:57,648 --> 00:14:59,692
I thought you'd be stopping by.

76
00:15:00,359 --> 00:15:02,111
I fucking knew it.

77
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,114
I don't know ya, but I knew.

78
00:15:08,284 --> 00:15:09,910
Shut the hell up.

79
00:15:10,286 --> 00:15:12,496
You don't tell my mother nothin'.

80
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:17,626
She's sad enough already.
She don't need to know nothing more.

81
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:19,503
We don't give a fuck.

82
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:30,723
Tomorrow morning in church...

83
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:34,351
...you're gonna spit out some pretty words.

84
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:38,856
Agathe will love it.
Everyone will love it.

85
00:15:38,981 --> 00:15:40,733
It'll be a gas.

86
00:15:41,442 --> 00:15:43,736
Then... you pack your bags.

87
00:15:44,695 --> 00:15:47,031
You're out of our lives.

88
00:15:47,156 --> 00:15:48,949
And so is he.

89
00:16:40,376 --> 00:16:41,794
D'you have sweet dreams?

90
00:16:44,755 --> 00:16:46,006
Yeah. You?

91
00:16:47,758 --> 00:16:50,594
I don't sleep much. I read.

92
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:02,231
I really love what you wrote, Tom.

93
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:06,610
Sounds real pretty, Agathe.

94
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:11,031
Them folks will be cryin' buckets.

95
00:17:12,991 --> 00:17:14,284
And...

96
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:18,622
I brought a CD with a song
I'd like to play later.

97
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,458
A song he liked.

98
00:17:22,793 --> 00:17:24,461
If that's ok.

99
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:26,839
Of course. Good.

100
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:33,053
Go get ready instead of
strutting like a damn rooster.

101
00:18:25,189 --> 00:18:26,774
No perfume, by the way!

102
00:18:26,899 --> 00:18:29,693
I smell it.
Perfume's for weddings, not funerals.

103
00:18:40,496 --> 00:18:42,414
<i>Our young fellow</i>

104
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:45,042
was good with his hands, I've been told.

105
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:49,671
He liked to paint.
He used to dance and sure was good at it.

106
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,508
Now, our friend,

107
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:53,967
our son,

108
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:56,053
our confidant,

109
00:18:56,178 --> 00:18:57,638
our brother,

110
00:18:57,763 --> 00:19:00,474
can draw pictures for Christ,

111
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:03,310
for God is infinite

112
00:19:03,435 --> 00:19:05,395
and likes beautiful things.

113
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:08,649
We may think: He's gone.

114
00:19:08,774 --> 00:19:10,526
He left us.

115
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:11,944
It's unfair.

116
00:19:12,778 --> 00:19:16,365
But... another voice will say:

117
00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:19,743
"No, he's not gone.

118
00:19:20,536 --> 00:19:22,120
He's come home.

119
00:19:22,621 --> 00:19:25,499
Sitting at Christ's right hand.

120
00:19:25,624 --> 00:19:27,751
And justice is done.

121
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:30,796
He joins all our dearly departed.

122
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,674
And together, they laugh,

123
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:37,177
sing and eat at will."

124
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:39,763
We will now...

125
00:19:40,222 --> 00:19:42,099
...hear from...

126
00:19:42,224 --> 00:19:43,976
a friend of Guy's.

127
00:19:44,101 --> 00:19:45,269
Guillaume!

128
00:19:45,644 --> 00:19:46,770
Excuse me.

129
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:53,402
A friend of Guillaume's
will now talk about Guillaume.

130
00:19:53,527 --> 00:19:54,987
- Sorry.
- It's ok.

131
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:04,830
I don't know if... um..

132
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:15,215
We will now listen to a song, then.

133
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:33,460
You're asking for trouble!

134
00:22:58,336 --> 00:23:00,547
Goddammit, you scared me.

135
00:23:01,715 --> 00:23:03,383
Cussin' in church?

136
00:23:09,139 --> 00:23:10,599
So no speech, huh?

137
00:23:11,433 --> 00:23:13,185
Yeah, I know. It's...

138
00:23:21,485 --> 00:23:22,903
What are you doing?

139
00:23:23,737 --> 00:23:25,405
Don't touch me, ok?

140
00:23:43,715 --> 00:23:45,467
What happened to that speech?

141
00:23:48,845 --> 00:23:50,472
My mom was really hurt.

142
00:23:52,015 --> 00:23:53,850
I can't see her this way.

143
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:56,061
I just can't.

144
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,148
I told you what you had to do.

145
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:03,485
Pretty simple.

146
00:24:08,824 --> 00:24:10,659
Simple as pie, right?

147
00:24:17,457 --> 00:24:19,251
Stop it!

148
00:25:01,877 --> 00:25:04,546
"We're going on holiday to Ajaccio tonight."

149
00:25:14,014 --> 00:25:16,558
"We're going on holiday to Ajaccio tonight."

150
00:25:19,686 --> 00:25:21,062
"Who's talking?"

151
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,942
We spoke on the phone 'bout a year ago.
I remember your voice.

152
00:25:27,903 --> 00:25:30,572
When I heard it, I knew you'd show up.

153
00:25:31,198 --> 00:25:33,158
That you'd fuck shit up.

154
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:41,166
Now... we're going back to the house.

155
00:25:43,335 --> 00:25:46,755
And... I hope you make it up to me.

156
00:25:49,216 --> 00:25:50,967
You'll talk about Sarah.

157
00:25:53,345 --> 00:25:55,305
Sarah's my brother's girl.

158
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:58,016
Well, in my mom's mind she is.

159
00:25:59,351 --> 00:26:01,770
Sarah... she's a chain smoker.

160
00:26:03,355 --> 00:26:05,190
And a pasta lover.

161
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:09,152
Don't worry, you'll catch up.

162
00:26:10,028 --> 00:26:12,614
You don't go
till you've set things straight.

163
00:26:13,365 --> 00:26:14,616
That's it.

164
00:26:17,202 --> 00:26:19,996
Thought you wanted me out of your life.

165
00:27:37,907 --> 00:27:42,287
You fucking inbred redneck
motherfucking retard!

166
00:27:43,371 --> 00:27:46,416
"You'll catch up!"
"You'll set things straight!"

167
00:27:46,541 --> 00:27:49,002
Catch up with this, fucker!

168
00:27:49,127 --> 00:27:50,295
Bitch.

169
00:27:51,838 --> 00:27:54,090
You're on your own, farm boy!

170
00:28:13,693 --> 00:28:15,904
Ah, fuck the luggage.

171
00:31:10,036 --> 00:31:11,704
Sit down, Agathe.

172
00:31:22,882 --> 00:31:24,717
I felt your discomfort, Tom.

173
00:31:25,343 --> 00:31:28,930
The trout flopped around
his stomach all night.

174
00:31:29,347 --> 00:31:31,516
I would've loved to hear your speech.

175
00:31:33,268 --> 00:31:34,936
Sorry. It was...

176
00:31:35,353 --> 00:31:38,523
So clumsy, and unrehearsed...

177
00:31:39,691 --> 00:31:41,317
I bet it would've been touching.

178
00:31:57,834 --> 00:31:59,127
Whore.

179
00:32:00,503 --> 00:32:02,755
That whore should've been here!

180
00:32:08,511 --> 00:32:10,138
Tom just spoke with her.

181
00:32:15,935 --> 00:32:17,145
Who's "her"?

182
00:32:19,314 --> 00:32:20,982
Well her, Sarah.

183
00:32:27,614 --> 00:32:30,700
- Yeah, we spoke in the car.
- They spoke in the car.

184
00:32:30,825 --> 00:32:32,285
- What'd she say?
- Tell her.

185
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:33,995
Will you shut up!

186
00:32:47,342 --> 00:32:48,801
She said...

187
00:32:55,141 --> 00:32:58,603
"Today... a part of me has died...

188
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,231
And...

189
00:33:02,815 --> 00:33:06,152
No words can describe the
the emptiness I have to fill."

190
00:33:10,365 --> 00:33:12,533
And then she said...

191
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:14,535
"You're worthless.

192
00:33:15,244 --> 00:33:16,621
You're nothing.

193
00:33:17,455 --> 00:33:19,415
You're useless on this Earth, and...

194
00:33:20,667 --> 00:33:26,422
...if you couldn't stop him from dying,
crying's an even greater waste of time."

195
00:33:37,016 --> 00:33:38,434
She said...

196
00:33:41,604 --> 00:33:43,648
...she wished she'd met you.

197
00:33:52,115 --> 00:33:55,159
But for him...
love was between two people.

198
00:33:55,284 --> 00:33:58,454
No... friends, no family,
no intruders, no...

199
00:34:04,043 --> 00:34:07,880
And... she said he was her first real love.

200
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:10,842
Then she hung up.

201
00:34:11,843 --> 00:34:13,219
And...

202
00:34:13,344 --> 00:34:14,595
then...

203
00:34:15,096 --> 00:34:16,431
...she said...

204
00:34:21,018 --> 00:34:22,645
"I hate myself.

205
00:34:31,904 --> 00:34:34,282
I'll do everything to set things straight."

206
00:34:36,242 --> 00:34:37,910
Then she hung up.

207
00:34:45,668 --> 00:34:47,295
She should've come.

208
00:34:48,296 --> 00:34:50,173
To say these things to me.

209
00:34:56,637 --> 00:34:57,930
Francis.

210
00:34:58,931 --> 00:35:01,893
Give Tom some of your brother's clothes
and show him.

211
00:35:04,228 --> 00:35:05,480
What?

212
00:35:06,647 --> 00:35:08,274
How to milk the cows.

213
00:35:17,283 --> 00:35:18,743
Yep.

214
00:35:19,744 --> 00:35:21,704
You were impressive, back there.

215
00:35:23,122 --> 00:35:25,291
You forced me to lie.

216
00:35:28,878 --> 00:35:30,379
I meant the cows.

217
00:35:32,882 --> 00:35:34,509
You're good with the animals.

218
00:35:35,009 --> 00:35:36,344
You pet them.

219
00:35:38,888 --> 00:35:42,225
I didn't think milking machines
could be so high-tech.

220
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:45,394
Yeah.
They even got laser-guided ones now.

221
00:35:46,938 --> 00:35:49,190
It'd be so much less work.

222
00:35:50,441 --> 00:35:54,737
Who... who's the guy
you didn't let into church?

223
00:36:00,701 --> 00:36:02,578
And why doesn't anybody talk to you?

224
00:36:04,956 --> 00:36:06,791
At the center.

225
00:36:07,834 --> 00:36:09,293
I mean, he's your brother.

226
00:36:09,418 --> 00:36:12,004
I don't care about people, so...

227
00:36:13,923 --> 00:36:16,551
People don't care about me, y'know.

228
00:36:24,433 --> 00:36:26,227
You were real good, back there.

229
00:36:26,853 --> 00:36:28,479
I'm an animal-lover, so...

230
00:36:28,604 --> 00:36:29,856
I guess...

231
00:36:30,439 --> 00:36:32,608
No, I meant Sarah.

232
00:36:33,067 --> 00:36:36,320
The phone call.
Told my brother, "I won't tell Mom,

233
00:36:36,445 --> 00:36:40,783
but gimme a picture of you and a chick.
As long as she's pretty." Y'know? So...

234
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:43,995
That's how Sarah came up.

235
00:36:45,329 --> 00:36:47,123
Co-workers, apparently.

236
00:36:47,248 --> 00:36:48,583
Sarah Thibault?

237
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:50,251
Huh?

238
00:36:51,794 --> 00:36:54,338
Sarah Thibault the photocopy girl?

239
00:37:05,308 --> 00:37:06,475
Here.

240
00:37:21,699 --> 00:37:24,160
You carry that in your wallet like a trophy?

241
00:37:27,914 --> 00:37:29,373
Why not?

242
00:37:29,999 --> 00:37:32,001
Only picture of him I got.

243
00:37:32,627 --> 00:37:34,170
A recent one, I mean.

244
00:37:35,421 --> 00:37:38,758
My mom likes it.
She was so proud when she saw it.

245
00:37:38,883 --> 00:37:41,177
Why would you lie to your mother
if you love her?

246
00:37:47,391 --> 00:37:51,520
I dunno what world you live in,
what your game is, what you're into, but...

247
00:37:51,646 --> 00:37:53,606
I think I'm done here.

248
00:37:55,191 --> 00:37:57,610
I'm telling your mom everything
and then I'm gone.

249
00:39:13,644 --> 00:39:16,063
You're choking me!
You're CHOKING ME!

250
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:37,084
Don't tell me what my game is
and how to love my mom, ok?

251
00:39:38,169 --> 00:39:40,296
Once you're in, you're in.

252
00:39:42,339 --> 00:39:44,300
Now, you're gonna play ball.

253
00:40:38,312 --> 00:40:39,563
You're good?

254
00:40:45,319 --> 00:40:47,404
- Yes.
<i>- So...</i>

255
00:40:47,988 --> 00:40:52,159
...soak in bleach every day
for about a week.

256
00:40:52,827 --> 00:40:57,164
No more than 2 teaspoons of bleach
per... pint of water, say.

257
00:40:58,249 --> 00:40:59,959
Then ointment...

258
00:41:00,668 --> 00:41:02,586
...and Cloxacillin.

259
00:41:03,003 --> 00:41:05,339
The pharmacist will walk you through it.

260
00:41:05,464 --> 00:41:07,800
What's your connection to the Longchamps?

261
00:41:08,759 --> 00:41:10,052
Family.

262
00:41:11,011 --> 00:41:14,598
Oh, really?
So you're a Longchamp-Podowski?

263
00:41:20,604 --> 00:41:22,022
Distant relatives.

264
00:41:24,608 --> 00:41:26,026
They're distant relatives.

265
00:41:26,694 --> 00:41:28,195
I came for the funeral.

266
00:41:30,573 --> 00:41:31,991
My condolences.

267
00:41:36,203 --> 00:41:38,455
How well do you know your relatives?

268
00:41:39,456 --> 00:41:41,333
Better and better every day.

269
00:41:44,211 --> 00:41:47,006
Well, then... everything's fine.

270
00:41:49,008 --> 00:41:51,468
Have a safe trip back to Montreal,
Mr. Podowski.

271
00:41:56,265 --> 00:41:57,892
You got something there.

272
00:41:58,267 --> 00:41:59,685
I fell.

273
00:42:10,446 --> 00:42:12,907
This morning,
when I opened your bedroom door...

274
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:15,492
...I saw two beautiful boys sleeping.

275
00:42:17,411 --> 00:42:19,038
Two little boys...

276
00:42:20,623 --> 00:42:22,249
It made you happy, right?

277
00:42:30,674 --> 00:42:32,051
Tom, what...

278
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,179
What happened? You hurt yourself?

279
00:42:35,304 --> 00:42:36,931
That's the doctor.

280
00:42:37,514 --> 00:42:39,600
Doctor? What for?

281
00:42:39,725 --> 00:42:41,894
He hurt himself on the conveyor.

282
00:42:57,284 --> 00:42:59,078
Help him cut his meat.

283
00:43:30,401 --> 00:43:32,152
Tell me more about her.

284
00:43:32,987 --> 00:43:34,905
Did she say anything else?

285
00:43:43,747 --> 00:43:45,541
She said to tell you...

286
00:43:46,375 --> 00:43:48,127
...he had strong arms.

287
00:43:49,628 --> 00:43:53,173
She loved when those arms
picked her up and cracked her back.

288
00:43:55,592 --> 00:43:57,136
She said...

289
00:43:58,012 --> 00:44:00,973
"I loved feeling his sweaty armpits
on my shoulders.

290
00:44:01,932 --> 00:44:05,352
Sometimes, the way he walked,
I knew the sex would be insane.

291
00:44:12,359 --> 00:44:14,069
'Take your shirt off.

292
00:44:14,194 --> 00:44:15,904
Show me your armpits.

293
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:17,990
Put them on my lips.

294
00:44:18,615 --> 00:44:21,577
Pull your dick out through your fly
and come on my face."'

295
00:44:35,132 --> 00:44:36,383
Okaaay...

296
00:44:39,136 --> 00:44:41,597
That Sarah's quite the slut, huh?

297
00:44:45,017 --> 00:44:46,435
Lord o Lordy...

298
00:44:51,482 --> 00:44:53,067
Quite the slut!

299
00:44:54,818 --> 00:44:57,071
Quite the dirty little slut, huh?

300
00:44:58,697 --> 00:45:00,115
Slutty slut!

301
00:45:00,699 --> 00:45:02,076
Queen of 'em all!

302
00:45:10,667 --> 00:45:12,419
Feels good to laugh.

303
00:45:38,028 --> 00:45:39,571
<i>You're good to her.</i>

304
00:45:41,198 --> 00:45:43,867
<i>Hadn 't heard her laugh like that in ages.</i>

305
00:45:46,453 --> 00:45:48,288
Did you tell the doctor?

306
00:45:50,124 --> 00:45:51,750
That I did that to you?

307
00:45:58,799 --> 00:46:00,884
I should've taken you to the town over.

308
00:46:09,977 --> 00:46:11,270
Why?

309
00:46:18,402 --> 00:46:21,530
D'you ever wonder why I'm 30
and still live with my mom?

310
00:46:24,658 --> 00:46:26,493
I can make a woman happy.

311
00:46:28,579 --> 00:46:30,122
I got a nice farm.

312
00:46:32,458 --> 00:46:33,959
I got good looks.

313
00:46:41,675 --> 00:46:43,510
I know you like me.

314
00:46:56,899 --> 00:46:58,150
Don't go.

315
00:47:21,298 --> 00:47:23,175
Told you it'd be messy.

316
00:47:24,301 --> 00:47:26,345
She's a real fucking bleeder!

317
00:47:37,981 --> 00:47:39,233
You ok?

318
00:47:45,322 --> 00:47:46,782
Lemme help ya.

319
00:48:05,092 --> 00:48:06,385
Sorry.

320
00:48:06,885 --> 00:48:08,053
Sorry.

321
00:48:13,559 --> 00:48:14,893
I'm ok.

322
00:48:25,821 --> 00:48:28,865
I'm fine. Just never delivered a calf before.

323
00:48:29,992 --> 00:48:31,827
Kind of took me by surprise.

324
00:48:50,012 --> 00:48:51,680
I'm calling her Bitch Ass.

325
00:48:58,812 --> 00:49:00,647
'Cause you got a little bitch's ass.

326
00:49:02,024 --> 00:49:03,442
Shake it off.

327
00:49:04,610 --> 00:49:05,861
What?

328
00:49:09,239 --> 00:49:10,532
Come on.

329
00:49:58,121 --> 00:50:00,624
Next time you bail out on a whim...

330
00:50:03,752 --> 00:50:05,545
...try the soy field, will ya.

331
00:50:05,671 --> 00:50:08,423
This is October.
Corn's razor sharp.

332
00:50:09,007 --> 00:50:10,384
Sorry.

333
00:50:53,176 --> 00:50:54,386
Oh, no thank you.

334
00:50:55,011 --> 00:50:57,389
I don't... do that.
- Do it.

335
00:50:58,724 --> 00:51:01,143
I can't, 'cause I have...

336
00:51:01,268 --> 00:51:02,602
tachycardia.

337
00:51:06,565 --> 00:51:07,983
Three...

338
00:51:10,444 --> 00:51:12,112
...two...

339
00:51:14,531 --> 00:51:15,949
...one...

340
00:51:32,674 --> 00:51:35,802
I used to take tango lessons
with my brother.

341
00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:39,389
It was his idea.
He wanted me to mingle.

342
00:51:39,848 --> 00:51:43,602
Salsa, social dancing, tango,
everything.

343
00:51:43,727 --> 00:51:46,354
All them girls wanted
the handsome farmers.

344
00:51:48,064 --> 00:51:49,941
We were the ones.

345
00:51:53,570 --> 00:51:55,238
This one girl...
And this one girl...

346
00:51:57,783 --> 00:52:00,243
...at dance class.
She was...

347
00:52:08,418 --> 00:52:10,045
She was the shit.

348
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:14,216
Girl at the store said it was real silk velvet.

349
00:52:14,341 --> 00:52:16,259
She said it'd do it.

350
00:52:19,721 --> 00:52:21,640
Why didn't you give it to her?

351
00:52:54,464 --> 00:52:55,882
You can dance?

352
00:52:58,260 --> 00:52:59,678
Who taught you?

353
00:53:09,646 --> 00:53:11,314
Not bad.

354
00:53:12,357 --> 00:53:15,110
I'm stuck here 'cause of my mom, y'know.

355
00:53:15,485 --> 00:53:17,529
I could leave, but I can't.

356
00:53:17,946 --> 00:53:19,823
Can't leave her alone.

357
00:53:19,948 --> 00:53:22,409
I'll have to put her in a home, one day.

358
00:53:22,534 --> 00:53:25,704
She's 5 years from a full-on basket case.

359
00:53:27,497 --> 00:53:30,709
Had it 'bout up to here watching corn grow.

360
00:53:31,167 --> 00:53:34,337
Milkin' the cows, picking off coyotes.
I'm bored off my ass!

361
00:53:41,595 --> 00:53:43,722
Sometimes I wish she'd go quickly.

362
00:53:44,389 --> 00:53:47,684
Find her one morning
in the kitchen, y'know?

363
00:53:47,809 --> 00:53:50,937
Phone in her hand, drooling
on the floor, eyes rolled back.

364
00:53:56,902 --> 00:53:59,154
I'd be sad, 'cause I love her.

365
00:53:59,529 --> 00:54:01,948
But she wouldn't end up in a home.

366
00:54:05,952 --> 00:54:07,370
And I'd sell.

367
00:54:24,679 --> 00:54:26,181
I made apple pie.

368
00:54:30,226 --> 00:54:31,394
What?

369
00:54:32,729 --> 00:54:35,190
I made... apple pie.

370
00:54:39,069 --> 00:54:40,862
She had a nice calf.

371
00:54:42,489 --> 00:54:44,366
We're calling it Bitch Ass.

372
00:54:47,494 --> 00:54:49,537
That's no name for a calf.

373
00:54:52,582 --> 00:54:54,793
D'you hear what I just said?

374
00:55:05,595 --> 00:55:07,222
D'you hear what I said?

375
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:13,019
Yes, every word.

376
00:55:13,478 --> 00:55:16,648
And I said that's no name for a calf.

377
00:55:17,983 --> 00:55:20,318
Come eat before the pies get cold.

378
00:55:37,627 --> 00:55:39,045
It's your fault.

379
00:57:13,306 --> 00:57:16,351
Go get changed.
We're going for a ride.

380
00:57:23,316 --> 00:57:24,734
What are we doing?

381
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:29,364
I'm buying beer.
We're getting wasted somewhere.

382
00:57:32,242 --> 00:57:35,370
I thought you'd take me to some bar.
Show me around or something.

383
00:57:36,704 --> 00:57:38,081
Why not?

384
00:58:32,177 --> 00:58:33,428
You...

385
00:58:35,972 --> 00:58:37,807
You're just a waste of cum.

386
00:58:41,186 --> 00:58:42,812
What's the point of your life?

387
00:59:00,205 --> 00:59:02,040
You smell like shit.

388
00:59:12,425 --> 00:59:14,052
You wearing cologne?

389
00:59:18,806 --> 00:59:20,266
Just a bit.

390
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:29,067
Cologne's for weddings.

391
00:59:59,847 --> 01:00:01,724
Is that all you've got?

392
01:00:03,851 --> 01:00:05,728
Harder.

393
01:00:18,199 --> 01:00:19,909
Tell me when to stop.

394
01:00:21,494 --> 01:00:23,121
You're the boss.

395
01:00:32,505 --> 01:00:34,132
You smell like him.

396
01:00:37,635 --> 01:00:39,137
You smell like him.

397
01:00:42,557 --> 01:00:44,350
And the voice, too.

398
01:00:45,518 --> 01:00:47,353
Same fucking voice.

399
01:01:10,335 --> 01:01:11,961
I'll be waiting in the truck.

400
01:04:00,546 --> 01:04:02,089
<i>It's Tom.</i>

401
01:04:02,215 --> 01:04:04,509
<i>I'm sorry I'm calling so late.</i>

402
01:04:04,634 --> 01:04:06,135
I just couldn't sleep.

403
01:04:09,347 --> 01:04:10,598
Listen...

404
01:04:12,517 --> 01:04:14,143
Can you come here?

405
01:04:14,936 --> 01:04:16,562
This is it.

406
01:04:18,564 --> 01:04:21,901
- Can't you drive me to the house?
- Nope.

407
01:04:22,026 --> 01:04:23,528
Why not? It's right there.

408
01:04:23,653 --> 01:04:25,947
I don't do that house.
50 bucks, please.

409
01:04:26,072 --> 01:04:27,990
Amazing.

410
01:04:29,867 --> 01:04:31,911
Thanks very much. Good night.

411
01:04:36,332 --> 01:04:38,000
Don't forget this.

412
01:04:52,348 --> 01:04:55,601
Sorry about the mess.
It's been hell around here.

413
01:04:56,644 --> 01:04:57,895
But...

414
01:04:58,437 --> 01:05:00,731
If I'd known you were coming,
I'd have made pasta.

415
01:05:00,856 --> 01:05:04,443
My son Francis said Guillaume told him
you love pasta.

416
01:05:06,612 --> 01:05:08,239
But not tonight.

417
01:05:09,907 --> 01:05:12,118
So sweet of you, but I'm full.

418
01:05:18,374 --> 01:05:20,835
You sure are pretty, Miss.

419
01:05:25,631 --> 01:05:27,758
Strange thing to say with him gone!

420
01:05:31,804 --> 01:05:34,140
It's Sarah, our lovely Sarah.

421
01:05:34,265 --> 01:05:36,642
- What the fuck is this?
- Oh, come on!

422
01:05:37,101 --> 01:05:38,603
Your brother's girlfriend!

423
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:54,410
Silly me.

424
01:05:58,664 --> 01:06:02,251
Francis smokes these on special occasions.
But he'll share, won't he?

425
01:06:03,294 --> 01:06:05,755
And you can smoke inside.
My husband did

426
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:08,049
from '71 to 2001, so the smell...

427
01:06:08,174 --> 01:06:09,634
I don't smoke, ma'am.

428
01:06:16,682 --> 01:06:18,934
My brother sure knew how to pick 'em.

429
01:06:30,988 --> 01:06:32,531
Go get Tom.

430
01:06:40,915 --> 01:06:42,708
Then give her some tea, won't ya.

431
01:06:49,674 --> 01:06:51,509
Tom's feeding the cows.

432
01:06:54,095 --> 01:06:55,304
What?

433
01:06:56,681 --> 01:06:58,933
Tom's feeding the cows.

434
01:07:04,647 --> 01:07:07,775
You're even more of a hard-on in the flesh

435
01:07:10,152 --> 01:07:12,822
It's... a nice house. It's great.

436
01:07:12,947 --> 01:07:15,074
I appreciate the coziness--

437
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:19,912
I dunno why the hell you're here,
but my mom's glad you are.

438
01:07:20,037 --> 01:07:21,580
Make sure she stays that way.

439
01:07:36,303 --> 01:07:38,013
Fuck, you're a babe.

440
01:07:38,639 --> 01:07:40,683
You're fucking nuts.

441
01:07:44,937 --> 01:07:46,355
Why are you here?

442
01:07:48,357 --> 01:07:51,652
Tom said it'd make your mom happy
if I just showed up

443
01:07:51,777 --> 01:07:54,989
and pretended I was Guillaume's girl.
Ain't it cute?

444
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:57,700
Didn't tell me I smoked, though.

445
01:07:57,825 --> 01:07:59,577
And you love pasta.

446
01:08:00,619 --> 01:08:02,997
- How many languages do I speak?
- Four.

447
01:08:05,332 --> 01:08:07,001
I'd fuck you...

448
01:08:08,544 --> 01:08:11,005
I'd fuck the blood outta your tiny cunt.

449
01:08:14,341 --> 01:08:16,010
How much you owe him?

450
01:08:20,931 --> 01:08:22,600
How much you owe him?

451
01:08:23,058 --> 01:08:27,229
I bet you owe him big to come here
and make a total stranger happy.

452
01:08:48,125 --> 01:08:49,752
Come, you'll see.

453
01:08:49,877 --> 01:08:51,420
Come, come, come.

454
01:08:52,004 --> 01:08:53,255
Look.

455
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:57,843
I didn't wanna spoil the surprise!

456
01:09:04,642 --> 01:09:06,435
I'm so glad you're here.

457
01:09:09,021 --> 01:09:10,773
Thanks for coming.

458
01:09:10,898 --> 01:09:12,775
Means a lot to me.

459
01:09:13,317 --> 01:09:15,194
We're so happy to have you here.

460
01:09:15,319 --> 01:09:16,654
Give her a taste.

461
01:09:18,823 --> 01:09:20,658
- It's...
- Taste.

462
01:09:26,622 --> 01:09:28,541
- It's good.
- Good, huh?

463
01:09:28,666 --> 01:09:30,584
Let's move on to the living room.

464
01:09:30,709 --> 01:09:33,504
And I'll make pasta later anyway, huh?

465
01:09:34,338 --> 01:09:37,299
It's been a long time
since we had so much company.

466
01:09:37,925 --> 01:09:41,303
Actually... not since my husband passed.

467
01:09:42,346 --> 01:09:44,014
Come on, now. Don't be shy.

468
01:09:44,139 --> 01:09:45,891
Sit next to me, Sarah.

469
01:09:51,939 --> 01:09:55,484
I dunno about pasta, though...
I don't think Sarah's staying--

470
01:09:55,609 --> 01:09:58,237
Why not?
You bet, she's staying the night!

471
01:09:58,362 --> 01:09:59,738
Well, I got a bus to catch.

472
01:10:00,114 --> 01:10:02,700
She'll stay the night,
take the bus tomorrow morning.

473
01:10:10,666 --> 01:10:12,501
Well, Sarah...

474
01:10:12,626 --> 01:10:15,504
It's real sad you couldn't come
to the funeral.

475
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:21,135
I didn't have the strength...

476
01:10:23,095 --> 01:10:24,930
Agathe. I know. Please!

477
01:10:31,103 --> 01:10:33,355
We'll have a drink, at least.

478
01:10:33,981 --> 01:10:35,941
We'll drink to his memory.

479
01:10:36,567 --> 01:10:38,277
I got some good brandy in my room.

480
01:10:38,402 --> 01:10:40,654
Francis, get the nice glasses
from the garage.

481
01:10:40,779 --> 01:10:44,158
We'll get dressed up, too.
We're not savages.

482
01:10:44,575 --> 01:10:46,368
I'm going for a smoke.

483
01:10:47,077 --> 01:10:48,871
Yeah, yeah, I smoke.

484
01:10:48,996 --> 01:10:52,166
I dunno why I lied to you.
Stupid of me.

485
01:10:52,791 --> 01:10:54,376
Let's have a smoke, Tom.

486
01:11:05,512 --> 01:11:07,681
<i>These people work 24/7.</i>

487
01:11:07,806 --> 01:11:10,893
You have to see my calf.
I have a calf now.

488
01:11:11,018 --> 01:11:12,478
His name's Bitch Ass.

489
01:11:12,603 --> 01:11:14,480
Frank's idea, of course.

490
01:11:14,605 --> 01:11:17,107
Named in my honor, apparently.

491
01:11:17,232 --> 01:11:21,111
45-minute delivery,
'cause he was born with a crooked leg,

492
01:11:21,236 --> 01:11:23,572
so the vet came--
- Go get your things.

493
01:11:26,951 --> 01:11:28,619
We'll take your car.

494
01:11:29,036 --> 01:11:29,995
C'mon.

495
01:11:31,163 --> 01:11:32,581
Well... no.

496
01:11:35,751 --> 01:11:37,211
Excuse me?

497
01:11:37,628 --> 01:11:39,463
You don't wanna go home?

498
01:11:39,964 --> 01:11:41,215
Christ...

499
01:11:41,882 --> 01:11:44,927
That dick fucking assaulted me.
I didn't get it at first, but...

500
01:11:45,052 --> 01:11:46,929
Still, thank God you called.

501
01:11:47,054 --> 01:11:49,014
Fuck, now I fucking get it.

502
01:11:49,473 --> 01:11:54,019
Look, I dunno what he did to you,
but I apologize on his behalf, ok?

503
01:11:54,853 --> 01:11:57,731
That's the way he is. Can't change him.

504
01:11:57,856 --> 01:11:59,024
Oh, sorry.

505
01:12:01,568 --> 01:12:03,362
You're covered in bruises.

506
01:12:03,487 --> 01:12:05,239
Your neck is fucking black!

507
01:12:07,783 --> 01:12:10,077
He'll have to sell if I leave.

508
01:12:11,245 --> 01:12:14,540
You got no idea
how much work 48 cows is.

509
01:12:16,667 --> 01:12:18,335
It's a big job.

510
01:12:18,669 --> 01:12:21,380
Eventually, he'll institutionalize
his mom, too.

511
01:12:21,505 --> 01:12:23,257
He'll end up alone here.

512
01:12:24,008 --> 01:12:26,635
Meanwhile, what use am I!
I'm worth shit!

513
01:12:27,094 --> 01:12:28,971
So what am I gonna do?

514
01:12:29,096 --> 01:12:32,057
Buy a laser-guided milking machine.

515
01:12:32,516 --> 01:12:35,978
He's got a standard milking machine;
I'll buy him a laser-guided one.

516
01:12:36,103 --> 01:12:37,479
It's gonna be amazing.

517
01:12:42,818 --> 01:12:44,737
They're like family, Sarah.

518
01:12:44,862 --> 01:12:47,281
They were strangers three weeks ago.

519
01:12:50,826 --> 01:12:53,287
I-I-I... I can't explain it.

520
01:12:54,455 --> 01:12:56,331
Look around. This place, it's...

521
01:12:56,915 --> 01:12:58,667
It's real.

522
01:12:58,792 --> 01:13:00,085
It's all so real.

523
01:13:01,712 --> 01:13:05,382
A cow gives birth, there's blood in the hay.
A dog barks, you hear it!

524
01:13:10,721 --> 01:13:13,932
You had me come here to be
a dead dude's girlfriend.

525
01:13:14,058 --> 01:13:15,768
You wanna talk "real"?

526
01:13:20,397 --> 01:13:23,901
Your boyfriend lied to his mom, ok?

527
01:13:24,485 --> 01:13:26,695
You think he didn't lie to you too?

528
01:13:30,824 --> 01:13:32,117
I fucked him.

529
01:13:41,085 --> 01:13:42,836
I'm telling you now...

530
01:13:42,961 --> 01:13:44,922
but it ain't breakin' news...

531
01:13:46,757 --> 01:13:49,176
'Cause everyone fucked him, Tom.

532
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:53,347
Gave you a ride on his bike, in his car;
that was the sign.

533
01:13:53,764 --> 01:13:55,724
Hit it in the backstreet, short 'n sweet.

534
01:14:00,437 --> 01:14:01,730
Look...

535
01:14:02,189 --> 01:14:03,357
You know what?

536
01:14:04,108 --> 01:14:05,859
...get your things...

537
01:14:06,610 --> 01:14:08,362
And we'll talk in the car.

538
01:14:13,117 --> 01:14:14,576
How many times?

539
01:14:17,121 --> 01:14:18,956
How many times d'you fuck him?

540
01:14:19,957 --> 01:14:22,793
Just get your fucking suitcase, fuck!

541
01:14:24,128 --> 01:14:26,296
You done smokin' darts? Come on!

542
01:14:34,138 --> 01:14:35,806
The car's gone.

543
01:14:45,149 --> 01:14:46,733
We're driving her back.

544
01:14:46,859 --> 01:14:49,611
- What?
- We're taking her to the station.

545
01:14:50,028 --> 01:14:52,739
- She just got here.
- Listen up.

546
01:14:52,865 --> 01:14:55,325
Last bus is at midnight and I'm on it.

547
01:14:55,450 --> 01:14:57,619
Tom, just do what you want.

548
01:14:59,454 --> 01:15:02,124
- What d'you say? We were doing fine.
- Nothing.

549
01:15:02,249 --> 01:15:04,543
Don't touch him, ok?

550
01:15:04,668 --> 01:15:08,005
He doesn't need to say anything,
I've got eyes!

551
01:15:13,177 --> 01:15:17,639
You're going to the cemetery with Mom
to visit your boyfriend's grave.

552
01:15:18,140 --> 01:15:20,934
You tell my mom
you wanna see his grave.

553
01:15:21,059 --> 01:15:22,936
Then, you take the bus.

554
01:15:23,061 --> 01:15:24,855
Actually, I'll decide.

555
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:27,024
I'm not scared of you.

556
01:15:28,609 --> 01:15:31,653
We'll take you for a nice
stroll through the corn.

557
01:15:36,116 --> 01:15:37,701
This is October.

558
01:15:38,493 --> 01:15:40,454
The fields are razor-sharp.

559
01:15:51,506 --> 01:15:53,050
What's that?

560
01:16:09,858 --> 01:16:11,568
His first report card.

561
01:16:19,910 --> 01:16:22,079
His first real watch.

562
01:16:24,039 --> 01:16:26,083
The one we bought in St. Anne.

563
01:16:35,050 --> 01:16:38,720
And these are... his notebooks, with...

564
01:16:40,555 --> 01:16:42,933
...drawings, writings, I guess.

565
01:16:47,813 --> 01:16:49,940
How come you have those?

566
01:16:51,149 --> 01:16:52,943
He didn't take 'em?

567
01:16:56,071 --> 01:16:57,739
He left them here.

568
01:16:59,074 --> 01:17:00,742
In my room, actually.

569
01:17:02,286 --> 01:17:03,745
D'you read 'em?

570
01:17:07,332 --> 01:17:09,960
But now, if they can help us understand.

571
01:17:15,716 --> 01:17:17,342
Will you open one?

572
01:17:18,927 --> 01:17:21,179
And read it to us? Sarah's here...

573
01:17:23,098 --> 01:17:25,475
She was close to him, so...

574
01:17:31,940 --> 01:17:34,985
Anyways, that's boring.
And we have company.

575
01:17:36,528 --> 01:17:38,071
Bad idea.

576
01:17:39,740 --> 01:17:41,575
Is it a bad idea, Tom?

577
01:17:43,744 --> 01:17:44,995
Yes.

578
01:17:53,545 --> 01:17:55,380
His confirmation tie.

579
01:18:01,345 --> 01:18:03,013
A lock of hair.

580
01:18:04,556 --> 01:18:06,600
He was 16 when he left, and...

581
01:18:07,225 --> 01:18:09,353
...that mop of hair he had, huh?

582
01:18:11,772 --> 01:18:13,190
So pretty.

583
01:18:13,982 --> 01:18:15,609
Real real pretty.

584
01:18:17,903 --> 01:18:20,822
Then he came back and it was so short.

585
01:18:25,911 --> 01:18:27,662
It's yours, Sarah.

586
01:18:28,497 --> 01:18:30,415
It's all yours now, right?

587
01:18:36,588 --> 01:18:39,049
Why won't she take the box?

588
01:18:46,515 --> 01:18:49,434
Why won't she do what she's supposed to do?

589
01:18:51,603 --> 01:18:54,064
Why doesn't she look sad?

590
01:18:56,274 --> 01:18:59,069
Why didn't she rush to his grave?

591
01:18:59,194 --> 01:19:02,239
- She wants to--
- Why didn't she bring me flowers?

592
01:19:05,409 --> 01:19:08,870
Why didn't Tom... speak in church!

593
01:19:09,663 --> 01:19:12,666
Why did my son... stop visiting?

594
01:19:13,792 --> 01:19:16,253
Why didn't he call or write anymore?

595
01:19:17,712 --> 01:19:19,756
What kind of accident was it?

596
01:19:20,841 --> 01:19:22,467
Who was he with?

597
01:19:22,926 --> 01:19:24,386
How did it happen?

598
01:19:24,511 --> 01:19:26,263
Where? When?

599
01:19:28,223 --> 01:19:30,684
No one dies at 25!

600
01:19:31,852 --> 01:19:33,270
No one!

601
01:19:34,062 --> 01:19:36,815
No one! No one! No one!

602
01:19:36,940 --> 01:19:38,108
Shut up!

603
01:19:42,446 --> 01:19:43,572
Ma'am...

604
01:19:43,947 --> 01:19:45,699
I'm taking you to the station.

605
01:19:54,082 --> 01:19:55,917
I'm so fucking drunk.

606
01:20:01,256 --> 01:20:02,299
No thanks.

607
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:04,634
C'mon...

608
01:20:14,478 --> 01:20:15,645
Here.

609
01:20:15,770 --> 01:20:17,731
Fucking bunch of psychos.

610
01:20:18,482 --> 01:20:20,650
Goddamn bunch...

611
01:20:20,775 --> 01:20:22,444
of goddamn psychos.

612
01:20:22,569 --> 01:20:24,321
Just the way God made me.

613
01:20:31,995 --> 01:20:33,330
What's this?

614
01:20:34,706 --> 01:20:36,208
A gift.

615
01:20:36,583 --> 01:20:37,584
For you.

616
01:20:37,709 --> 01:20:38,835
Jeez.

617
01:20:41,713 --> 01:20:43,340
What the hell!

618
01:20:44,799 --> 01:20:47,761
Damn.
What am I supposed to do with this?

619
01:20:48,345 --> 01:20:50,764
I dunno, just fucking wear it.

620
01:20:56,937 --> 01:20:58,313
It's so soft.

621
01:21:01,149 --> 01:21:02,984
Why don't you go for a walk?

622
01:21:07,531 --> 01:21:08,782
What?

623
01:21:10,325 --> 01:21:12,369
Go for a walk.

624
01:21:15,163 --> 01:21:16,456
Me?

625
01:21:20,752 --> 01:21:24,464
You and all your friends in the backseat.

626
01:22:16,808 --> 01:22:18,852
<i>The Real Thing</i>

627
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:33,742
I... Hi.

628
01:22:34,117 --> 01:22:35,869
What can I do ya for, blondie?

629
01:22:36,578 --> 01:22:38,371
I'll have a beer.

630
01:22:38,496 --> 01:22:40,081
Draft or bottle?

631
01:22:41,041 --> 01:22:42,292
Draft.

632
01:22:44,628 --> 01:22:46,463
Pint of lager.

633
01:22:46,588 --> 01:22:47,672
On its way.

634
01:22:55,263 --> 01:22:56,890
$3, please.

635
01:22:59,267 --> 01:23:00,685
Keep the change, sir.

636
01:23:02,270 --> 01:23:03,688
Where d'ya get the accent?

637
01:23:06,441 --> 01:23:09,235
- I'm from Montreal.
- Ah, Montreal.

638
01:23:09,361 --> 01:23:10,904
That's where you got it.

639
01:23:12,113 --> 01:23:13,573
What brings you here?

640
01:23:16,534 --> 01:23:18,119
My man died.

641
01:23:19,871 --> 01:23:22,123
Sorry. My sympathies.

642
01:23:29,673 --> 01:23:33,718
I came for the funeral and...
I'm helping out at the Longchamp farm.

643
01:23:38,682 --> 01:23:40,517
I hope you came alone.

644
01:23:42,894 --> 01:23:45,271
'Cause Big guy ain't welcome here.

645
01:23:45,397 --> 01:23:47,148
Francis' banned.

646
01:23:54,197 --> 01:23:55,490
All good, ladies?

647
01:23:59,577 --> 01:24:00,870
Why?

648
01:24:01,538 --> 01:24:02,747
Why what?

649
01:24:03,331 --> 01:24:05,291
Why's Francis banned?

650
01:24:06,501 --> 01:24:08,378
You know damn well.

651
01:24:09,003 --> 01:24:11,631
No. I'm not from around here.

652
01:24:12,215 --> 01:24:14,426
Look, it ain't pretty.

653
01:24:19,180 --> 01:24:20,807
Hit me.

654
01:24:21,391 --> 01:24:24,352
Look, son,
if you're staying at Mrs. Longchamp's,

655
01:24:24,477 --> 01:24:27,021
I respect that, so I don't wanna...

656
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:29,566
...gossip.
Y'know?

657
01:24:30,024 --> 01:24:31,568
I don't give a fuck.

658
01:24:34,404 --> 01:24:35,613
Sorry.

659
01:24:36,740 --> 01:24:38,408
I want to know.

660
01:24:54,799 --> 01:24:57,969
It happened here, nine years ago.
I remember,

661
01:24:58,094 --> 01:25:02,557
'cause Josée and I were celebrating
the bar's 30th anniversary that night.

662
01:25:02,682 --> 01:25:04,392
Everyone was having a blast,

663
01:25:04,517 --> 01:25:07,604
singing and dancing,
we were drunk as skunks.

664
01:25:09,230 --> 01:25:11,983
Francis was here with his little brother.

665
01:25:12,108 --> 01:25:14,360
Struttin' his stuff on the dance floor.

666
01:25:16,446 --> 01:25:18,239
Spinnin' and glidin' like pros.

667
01:25:19,699 --> 01:25:21,451
Showin' off.

668
01:25:22,327 --> 01:25:24,287
Impressing the ladies, y'know...

669
01:25:25,580 --> 01:25:27,123
Anyway, it...

670
01:25:29,834 --> 01:25:33,254
Then the kid... Francis's kid brother...

671
01:25:35,215 --> 01:25:36,841
Guillaume, damn it.

672
01:25:38,468 --> 01:25:40,804
He started dancing with a guy...

673
01:25:40,929 --> 01:25:43,306
A friend, a guy his age.

674
01:25:44,933 --> 01:25:48,311
Guy wearing white jeans
and a green tank top.

675
01:25:49,145 --> 01:25:50,814
Francis...

676
01:25:50,939 --> 01:25:54,150
...came over and ordered a beer.

677
01:25:56,820 --> 01:25:59,823
Then the kid dancing with his brother...

678
01:25:59,948 --> 01:26:02,909
came over to talk to him and...

679
01:26:04,035 --> 01:26:07,288
He sat right there, two seats over.

680
01:26:09,290 --> 01:26:11,334
He said something and...

681
01:26:12,126 --> 01:26:14,045
...shit hit the fan.

682
01:26:14,170 --> 01:26:15,463
That's it.

683
01:26:22,303 --> 01:26:24,514
Shit, um... What'd he say?

684
01:26:25,348 --> 01:26:27,851
Well... he said...

685
01:26:27,976 --> 01:26:30,019
I don't remember what he said.

686
01:26:32,689 --> 01:26:35,733
You remember the green tank top
and white jeans, though.

687
01:26:36,693 --> 01:26:38,361
Don't push your luck, boy.

688
01:26:45,201 --> 01:26:46,744
He said...

689
01:26:48,413 --> 01:26:51,916
"I gotta tell ya something 'bout your brother.
You need to sit down."

690
01:26:55,128 --> 01:26:57,046
Then Francis jumped him.

691
01:26:57,797 --> 01:27:01,342
Put both hands in
and tore his mouth apart.

692
01:27:16,149 --> 01:27:17,775
Tore...?

693
01:27:18,192 --> 01:27:19,444
Right here.

694
01:27:21,696 --> 01:27:24,240
Down to... his throat.

695
01:27:25,575 --> 01:27:27,577
Ear to throat.

696
01:27:38,379 --> 01:27:41,633
- Then what?
- Ya didn't get your money's worth, dammit?

697
01:27:44,928 --> 01:27:46,429
Yeah, but...

698
01:27:47,722 --> 01:27:49,349
The kid?

699
01:27:49,474 --> 01:27:51,225
The kid, the kid...

700
01:27:51,935 --> 01:27:53,645
Never saw the likes of him again.

701
01:27:55,063 --> 01:27:58,024
Some say he lives
a couple of towns west of here.

702
01:27:58,858 --> 01:28:00,568
And some others saw him and...

703
01:28:00,693 --> 01:28:03,237
there's no mistakin' him.

704
01:28:05,949 --> 01:28:08,910
I dunno, 'cause I work all the time, so...

705
01:28:09,035 --> 01:28:12,997
Last time I got outta here was to make
a phone call during the ice storm in 97, so...

706
01:28:13,957 --> 01:28:15,625
So that's it for that.

707
01:28:18,211 --> 01:28:20,630
That's why Francis is banned.

708
01:34:46,891 --> 01:34:48,601
Where are you?

709
01:34:50,394 --> 01:34:51,812
Where are you?

710
01:34:52,980 --> 01:34:56,442
I'm sorry! I'm sorry, ok!

711
01:34:58,652 --> 01:35:00,112
Don't go!

712
01:35:02,406 --> 01:35:05,034
I won't hurt you, Tom, ok!

713
01:35:05,493 --> 01:35:07,620
What about me, man?

714
01:35:08,120 --> 01:35:11,040
Tom, don't you fucking do this to me!

715
01:35:14,418 --> 01:35:16,545
I need you, ok!

716
01:35:16,670 --> 01:35:19,048
I fucking need you here!

717
01:35:20,424 --> 01:35:22,760
I'm really disappointed, Tom!

718
01:35:22,885 --> 01:35:24,762
I'd never do it to you!

719
01:35:24,887 --> 01:35:26,472
Never!

720
01:35:27,681 --> 01:35:30,393
I'm trying to be a better person, ok?

721
01:35:31,018 --> 01:35:32,645
Fuck, Tom!

722
01:35:37,108 --> 01:35:38,484
Motherfucker!

723
01:35:40,236 --> 01:35:42,154
Wait till I find you!

724
01:35:54,250 --> 01:35:55,668
I can hear you.

725
01:36:11,725 --> 01:36:12,893
Fuck!

726
01:37:55,746 --> 01:37:56,997
Uh, sir--

727
01:38:31,782 --> 01:38:33,325
D'you need anything else?

728
01:38:33,867 --> 01:38:36,245
I'm good. Tank number 1, please.

729
01:38:55,723 --> 01:38:56,807
Thanks, ma'am.

730
01:38:56,932 --> 01:38:58,142
Thank you, bye.

731
01:42:44,451 --> 01:42:46,495
Subtitling: CNST, Montreal.
