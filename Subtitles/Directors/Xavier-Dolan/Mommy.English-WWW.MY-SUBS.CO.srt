1
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,118
In a fictional Canada,
a new government comes into power

2
00:00:51,243 --> 00:00:53,371
during the federal elections of 2015.

3
00:00:56,165 --> 00:01:00,386
Two months later, its cabinet
introduces the S-18 bill,

4
00:01:00,502 --> 00:01:04,348
aiming to amend
the Canadian health services policy.

5
00:01:06,592 --> 00:01:09,596
More specifically,
the highly controversial S-14 Bill

6
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,894
stipulates that the parent of
a child with behaviour problems has,

7
00:01:13,015 --> 00:01:16,519
in a situation of financial distress,
physical and/or psychological danger,

8
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:19,692
the moral and legal right
to put his children

9
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:23,568
in the care of any public hospital,
without due process of law.

10
00:01:26,737 --> 00:01:29,035
This is the story
of Diane "Die" Després,

11
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:32,456
a woman whose fate appears
to be intimately tied to this affair.

12
00:03:58,597 --> 00:03:59,597
You fuck!

13
00:04:03,935 --> 00:04:05,482
You cocksucker!

14
00:04:08,231 --> 00:04:09,231
Yeah?

15
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:20,623
Love the pool.

16
00:04:20,744 --> 00:04:21,870
Sorry, Mrs. Després.

17
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:24,206
We should've asked you
to bring your bikini.

18
00:04:24,748 --> 00:04:26,500
You a stand-up or something?

19
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,423
You sign Steve's eviction form

20
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,543
and you're both free.

21
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:32,969
Free from what!
Are we gonna talk about this?

22
00:04:36,259 --> 00:04:38,011
Do you speak French?

23
00:04:38,136 --> 00:04:41,356
Just as good
as they do in France, yeah.

24
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:47,647
At 12h15, your son
was in the cafeteria

25
00:04:47,771 --> 00:04:49,569
with four other residents,

26
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,318
when a fire broke out.

27
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:55,989
Little Kevin Julien was rushed
to the hospital,

28
00:04:56,113 --> 00:04:58,912
burned to the second,
if not third degree.

29
00:04:59,658 --> 00:05:02,502
Want me to draw you a picture too?

30
00:05:13,547 --> 00:05:15,299
Are those your kids?
They're cute.

31
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:20,729
Your initials below mine,
and sign the second-to-last page.

32
00:05:51,042 --> 00:05:53,215
So what do we do now?

33
00:05:54,838 --> 00:05:56,431
There's no "we".

34
00:05:57,674 --> 00:05:59,927
You know what I mean.
Not you and me.

35
00:06:00,051 --> 00:06:01,644
Me and my son.
I'm not stupid.

36
00:06:02,637 --> 00:06:04,264
We gave Steve a chance.

37
00:06:04,681 --> 00:06:05,898
If you can't take him back,

38
00:06:06,224 --> 00:06:07,851
we'll send him
to our security department.

39
00:06:07,976 --> 00:06:08,976
Excuse me?

40
00:06:09,853 --> 00:06:12,777
Don't act surprised!
Come on!

41
00:06:12,898 --> 00:06:15,822
Your son has
a one-way ticket to jail.

42
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:17,953
Are you insane?

43
00:06:18,069 --> 00:06:20,663
My boy ain't going to jail.
I know the drill.

44
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:23,455
Once they're in,
they're done for.

45
00:06:23,575 --> 00:06:24,952
His educator says

46
00:06:25,076 --> 00:06:27,750
his positive attitude made progress.

47
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:30,332
He keeps telling me
he's doing better.

48
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:33,836
This is a detention centre.

49
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:39,930
The kids do better...

50
00:06:40,425 --> 00:06:42,052
Until they don't.

51
00:06:43,678 --> 00:06:45,897
Have you given thought
to little Kevin Julien,

52
00:06:46,014 --> 00:06:48,016
scarred for life?

53
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:49,939
Little Kevin, little Kevin...

54
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,984
We gonna canonize the kid?
Shit him a statue?

55
00:06:53,104 --> 00:06:56,574
Tough luck! Next time, don't stick
your face in the microwave!

56
00:07:03,448 --> 00:07:05,871
- Jacqueline to Jacques.
- I'm listening.

57
00:07:06,535 --> 00:07:07,661
We're on our way.

58
00:07:09,621 --> 00:07:10,621
<i>Roger.</i>

59
00:07:17,045 --> 00:07:18,045
Listen...

60
00:07:18,463 --> 00:07:19,635
Diane...

61
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:24,269
I've seen tons of kids
in and out of here.

62
00:07:25,887 --> 00:07:27,560
We save some,

63
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:29,854
we lose some,
and that's the way of it.

64
00:07:30,475 --> 00:07:32,148
We tried helping Steve,

65
00:07:32,644 --> 00:07:34,021
as well as specialized schools,

66
00:07:34,145 --> 00:07:35,522
residential centres.

67
00:07:35,647 --> 00:07:37,320
Our centre tried helping him.

68
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,235
Your turn.

69
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:43,831
And what am I gonna do
with him all day long?

70
00:07:44,447 --> 00:07:46,245
I can't drag him to work.
I got a job.

71
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:49,085
I can't dump everything
and go party with my kid.

72
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:50,545
I'm broke.

73
00:07:51,413 --> 00:07:54,087
I'm this close to welfare
and welfare's a fucking no.

74
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:55,207
When he turns 16,

75
00:07:55,584 --> 00:07:58,508
he'll be eligible
for youth detention.

76
00:07:58,628 --> 00:08:00,926
I ain't gonna send my son
to a jail for lil' punks

77
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:04,802
waiting to be big punks!
They'll fuck him up.

78
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:10,265
Did you...

79
00:08:10,682 --> 00:08:13,026
consider the S-14 law?

80
00:08:16,813 --> 00:08:17,985
The new law.

81
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,901
Forget about it.

82
00:08:21,026 --> 00:08:22,026
As a last resort.

83
00:08:22,152 --> 00:08:23,404
I'll never do that to my son!

84
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:34,919
Don't consider him or yourself
invincible.

85
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,964
That's the worst thing you could do.

86
00:08:39,461 --> 00:08:41,680
Loving people doesn't save them.

87
00:08:42,631 --> 00:08:44,429
Love has no say.

88
00:08:45,133 --> 00:08:46,430
Unfortunately.

89
00:08:49,721 --> 00:08:51,598
Skeptics...

90
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,642
will be proven wrong.

91
00:08:56,561 --> 00:08:57,904
Good luck, Ma'am.

92
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:04,702
<i>Jacqueline, it's Jacques.
We brought little Després</i>

93
00:09:04,819 --> 00:09:07,117
<i>to the isolation room
because he was out of control.</i>

94
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:09,032
<i>Fucking son of a cunt!</i>

95
00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:11,827
<i>Don't ya touch me, bitch!
I dare ya, fucking homo!</i>

96
00:09:11,952 --> 00:09:16,583
<i>- I said calm down!
- Fucking suck-ass, ya flaming twat!</i>

97
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:18,921
<i>Suck my dick, dipshit!</i>

98
00:09:19,042 --> 00:09:20,042
Roger.

99
00:09:22,003 --> 00:09:25,849
At least you fixed his bad language.

100
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:27,309
You're stunning, babe!

101
00:09:27,425 --> 00:09:29,393
Every time, you're beautifuler!

102
00:09:29,511 --> 00:09:31,104
You look younger, too, that's dope!

103
00:09:31,221 --> 00:09:32,939
What's effin dope
is you starting a fire.

104
00:09:33,056 --> 00:09:34,808
That's real dope, boy!

105
00:09:34,933 --> 00:09:36,526
Fire's up my ass,
gotta let it out.

106
00:09:37,936 --> 00:09:41,110
Get your head out too,
once you're at it.

107
00:09:41,231 --> 00:09:42,403
Didn't ya miss me?

108
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:44,993
I always think of ya, Mom!
You're always in my head!

109
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,111
Your head's up your ass!

110
00:09:46,236 --> 00:09:48,284
Must be pretty dark in there.

111
00:09:48,405 --> 00:09:51,158
Dark as a black dude's ass
but I still see ya!

112
00:09:51,282 --> 00:09:52,704
Where the fuck's our ride!

113
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:54,794
Ride's gone.
We'll take the bus.

114
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:57,630
You're playing, right? LOL.

115
00:09:58,039 --> 00:10:00,542
LOL alright,
d'ya see the blood here?

116
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:01,793
Who's the motherfucker?

117
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:05,343
Some dumb-ass on Poirier Street.

118
00:10:05,463 --> 00:10:07,056
The car's an effin wreck.

119
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:08,675
Can we sell the parts online?

120
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,474
Fuck no.
Jeez, that foot hurts like a bitch!

121
00:10:11,594 --> 00:10:12,594
Gimme that.

122
00:10:13,471 --> 00:10:16,691
I couldn't stand
them fucking freaks anymore!

123
00:10:16,808 --> 00:10:17,934
Can I bum one?

124
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:19,978
I smoke, here!

125
00:10:20,103 --> 00:10:21,605
Well, time to quit!

126
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:23,357
I'm quitting too. On my birthday.

127
00:10:24,607 --> 00:10:27,201
You listen to me, Stevo!
Listen up!

128
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:29,287
We gotta set some ground rules!

129
00:10:29,404 --> 00:10:31,202
You wanna live with Mom?
Stay outta trouble?

130
00:10:31,322 --> 00:10:32,949
You gotta help.

131
00:10:33,074 --> 00:10:35,042
That starts with mutual respect, bud.

132
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,039
I don't wanna hear no more fuck yous,
am I clear'?

133
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,337
You deaf or what?

134
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:44,510
- Where do we live now?
- St-Hubert, next to the 116.

135
00:10:44,627 --> 00:10:45,627
Sexy.

136
00:10:46,004 --> 00:10:47,221
I got my own room?

137
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:50,850
I still got enough dough
for that, dimwit.

138
00:10:50,967 --> 00:10:52,560
I ain't gonna spoon at 40.

139
00:10:52,677 --> 00:10:54,099
- You're 46!
- Shut up!

140
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,893
Don't look at the deco, eh!

141
00:10:56,014 --> 00:10:58,938
Tenant before, some old lady,
she died two months ago.

142
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:01,027
There's so much tapestry in there

143
00:11:01,144 --> 00:11:02,145
we could start a shop.

144
00:11:02,479 --> 00:11:04,277
- I hate that ugly shit!
- I feel ya!

145
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,942
You can get the last toke.

146
00:11:17,577 --> 00:11:19,329
You didn't even kiss me!

147
00:11:19,454 --> 00:11:20,626
First thing I did.

148
00:11:20,747 --> 00:11:21,747
I don't think so.

149
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:24,293
You little shit.

150
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:25,793
Come on, come on!

151
00:11:26,544 --> 00:11:28,842
You little shit!

152
00:11:28,963 --> 00:11:30,465
You're just like your father!

153
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:50,409
Well, well!

154
00:11:51,069 --> 00:11:52,069
How is she?

155
00:11:52,237 --> 00:11:55,081
Same old! Hanging in there!

156
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:56,866
Don't tell me that's your kid?

157
00:11:56,991 --> 00:11:58,334
You betcha!

158
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:00,579
Just back from boarding school.

159
00:12:00,703 --> 00:12:02,330
- Paul.
- Steve.

160
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:07,295
Great social skills, eh! So proud!

161
00:12:07,418 --> 00:12:09,967
Why don't you guys
come watch some TV?

162
00:12:10,088 --> 00:12:13,183
I'll fix some pine-nut pesto pasta
real quick!

163
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:16,009
I dunno, some other time maybe,

164
00:12:16,678 --> 00:12:18,601
we're just gonna settle in
real smooth, ya know.

165
00:12:19,222 --> 00:12:20,314
Alright. Rain check, then?

166
00:12:24,227 --> 00:12:26,650
We gotta work
on that shit attitude, hon.

167
00:12:26,771 --> 00:12:28,318
<i>"I'll</i> fix some pasta..."

168
00:12:28,439 --> 00:12:30,282
Shut up!

169
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,698
- Yo, who's that homo!
- A neighbour.

170
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:36,373
Bitch, please!
He's obviousingly hitting on ya.

171
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:39,993
"Obviousingly."
That ain't in the dictionary.

172
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:41,410
We there?

173
00:12:43,913 --> 00:12:45,756
Not so five-stary, eh...

174
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:47,842
Is that in the dictionary?

175
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:49,381
This place's perfect, trust me.

176
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:51,095
There's a big yard.
Big yard, big life.

177
00:12:51,212 --> 00:12:52,555
Two bathrooms, right?

178
00:12:52,672 --> 00:12:53,924
Sure!
Waterbeds and jacuzzis, too!

179
00:12:54,048 --> 00:12:55,095
Where's my room?

180
00:12:55,216 --> 00:12:56,638
Down there!

181
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:43,598
Hey, Radio City Hall!

182
00:13:48,353 --> 00:13:51,448
Two radios at once!
Thanks but no thanks!

183
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:54,566
What?

184
00:13:55,318 --> 00:13:58,037
Shut her trap, will ya!

185
00:13:58,863 --> 00:14:02,913
We got both of them playin,
it's a goddamn racket!

186
00:14:06,996 --> 00:14:09,966
Mom, I can't find my shit
in that mess.

187
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,630
Where are dad's pics?

188
00:14:15,505 --> 00:14:17,052
Why d'you need that now?

189
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:20,259
They're...

190
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:26,020
They're in the bedroom!
I'm swimming in boxes, I dunno!

191
00:15:15,273 --> 00:15:16,490
No way...

192
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:19,698
Crazy bitch...

193
00:15:27,452 --> 00:15:29,705
Fucking A!

194
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:09,081
That's your last warning!

195
00:16:09,202 --> 00:16:12,797
That's another thing,
repeating myself again and again!

196
00:16:12,914 --> 00:16:14,211
That ain't in our contract!

197
00:16:14,832 --> 00:16:17,426
We gotta catch the 10h45 bus!
Otherwise we fall on AM shifts

198
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:19,545
and we'll hit lunch traffic.

199
00:16:20,004 --> 00:16:21,004
Come on, get up.

200
00:16:21,089 --> 00:16:22,090
Fuck, man!

201
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:23,432
Nice motel whiff, here...

202
00:16:23,841 --> 00:16:25,514
You're supposed
to knock before, fuck!

203
00:16:25,635 --> 00:16:27,637
You can be such a dumb-ass!

204
00:16:27,762 --> 00:16:28,762
Watch your mouth!
I knocked!

205
00:16:29,013 --> 00:16:31,732
Did not!
You just came in, fuck!

206
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:34,853
24 hours you've been here
and this place is a slum!

207
00:16:34,977 --> 00:16:36,194
Tidy up!

208
00:16:36,312 --> 00:16:38,030
Can I jerk off in peace, before!

209
00:16:38,147 --> 00:16:39,649
Gimme your undies.

210
00:16:39,774 --> 00:16:42,027
The bunched-up tissues,
not so guest-friendly.

211
00:16:42,151 --> 00:16:44,074
So get your jizz together

212
00:16:44,195 --> 00:16:45,242
and we'll be in business.

213
00:16:45,363 --> 00:16:47,036
Gonna hold my dick when I piss too?

214
00:16:47,156 --> 00:16:48,658
If it helps you aim!

215
00:18:54,992 --> 00:18:55,992
Mommy?

216
00:19:12,677 --> 00:19:14,179
What's the matter, sweetie?

217
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,438
"That we did win..."

218
00:19:16,556 --> 00:19:19,184
- Win what?
- The games?

219
00:19:19,767 --> 00:19:23,647
- Plural form.
- So you put?

220
00:19:23,771 --> 00:19:26,194
- An S.
- Very good.

221
00:19:39,287 --> 00:19:41,164
<i>$299.51, please.</i>

222
00:19:42,206 --> 00:19:43,298
Come again?

223
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:44,713
It's $300.

224
00:19:50,881 --> 00:19:51,882
And what's this?

225
00:19:52,675 --> 00:19:53,927
A work of art?

226
00:19:54,302 --> 00:19:56,020
If it was 300 bucks
I wouldn't have rushed

227
00:19:56,137 --> 00:19:58,139
all the way here
to frolic in car jams!

228
00:19:58,264 --> 00:20:01,268
Ma, I gotta get those pens!
They're fucking dope!

229
00:20:01,392 --> 00:20:03,611
It's our Fall issue, come on, now!

230
00:20:03,728 --> 00:20:07,107
Oh really? So a schoolbook's price's
got a season now?

231
00:20:07,648 --> 00:20:09,195
Why of course, dear!

232
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:12,036
"Why of course, dear, why of course!"

233
00:20:12,153 --> 00:20:13,951
How can I be so dumb!

234
00:20:14,071 --> 00:20:16,950
I bet it's written in pink
on every bitch's ass!

235
00:20:17,074 --> 00:20:20,453
Madam, our sales are valid
during the back to school period.

236
00:20:20,578 --> 00:20:22,125
- Afterwards...
- I haven't got a choice...

237
00:20:22,246 --> 00:20:23,793
Smells like fucking strawberries!

238
00:20:23,914 --> 00:20:25,882
I'm writing shit
and it smells like strawberries!

239
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,049
You don't need it, Stevie!
Stop moving things around!

240
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:30,170
Try this one.

241
00:20:30,713 --> 00:20:33,091
Mom, wait up!
There's all this shit, too!

242
00:20:33,215 --> 00:20:34,262
I don't think so.

243
00:20:34,383 --> 00:20:35,383
But I need it!

244
00:20:36,135 --> 00:20:37,887
I'm home-schooling you,
not opening a stickers shop!

245
00:20:38,012 --> 00:20:39,012
Mom!

246
00:20:39,221 --> 00:20:40,894
Come on!
I'll be late for work.

247
00:20:41,015 --> 00:20:42,107
Bitch...

248
00:20:42,725 --> 00:20:45,228
You shouldn't talk to your mother
that way, young man.

249
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:49,608
D'ya dip your bangs
in some ginger's ass or something?

250
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:51,609
I don't buy cars online!

251
00:20:51,734 --> 00:20:54,328
I ain't gonna spend my life
at a mechanic's!

252
00:20:54,445 --> 00:20:57,244
You just gotta check your shit,
lowball the shit out of it!

253
00:20:57,365 --> 00:20:58,833
Look I know the market.

254
00:20:58,949 --> 00:21:00,917
You watch your suspensions, you...

255
00:21:01,035 --> 00:21:03,413
The market! Sure!
And I'm Marilyn Monroe!

256
00:21:03,537 --> 00:21:06,131
Well beats being the metro's bitch

257
00:21:06,248 --> 00:21:08,250
and spending mad cash on cab rides!

258
00:21:08,376 --> 00:21:11,630
Steve, lemme manage the budget
and focus on your beat-off schedule.

259
00:21:11,754 --> 00:21:14,473
Yo, respect me, girl!
Treat me like an adult!

260
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:16,888
Mutual respect! Remember?

261
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:20,388
Yo sir, can you cut the bongos,
it fucking <i>sucks</i> ass!

262
00:21:20,513 --> 00:21:23,141
Let the driver listen to his bongos!
We're almost there.

263
00:21:23,265 --> 00:21:24,312
Where the fuck are we!

264
00:21:24,433 --> 00:21:25,685
Sir, I said don't take that street,

265
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:27,653
we'll get caught up in construction!

266
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:29,488
You never said that.
You say that earlier!

267
00:21:29,605 --> 00:21:33,655
You kidding, right?
I said, "Don't take Ste-Héléne."

268
00:21:33,776 --> 00:21:34,868
That's as clear as it gets!

269
00:21:34,985 --> 00:21:36,703
And you still did, like a boss!

270
00:21:36,821 --> 00:21:38,494
Watch your mouth, boy!

271
00:21:38,614 --> 00:21:40,082
Sir, make a U-turn.

272
00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:41,291
I can't, my friend.

273
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:43,869
- We're not your friends!
- Will you shut up, Steve!

274
00:21:43,994 --> 00:21:45,211
Sir, it ain't my problem.

275
00:21:45,329 --> 00:21:46,501
I told you DON'T go there.

276
00:21:46,622 --> 00:21:48,295
It's like all you want is to boost...

277
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,885
What! You accuse me?
Telling me I'm trying to rip you off?

278
00:21:51,001 --> 00:21:52,001
Chill out!

279
00:21:52,086 --> 00:21:53,087
Look, you tell me I rip you off,

280
00:21:53,212 --> 00:21:55,340
you tell me I'm a crook,
with your son!

281
00:21:55,464 --> 00:21:57,011
- You yell at me!
- Fuck off, Mamadou!

282
00:21:57,133 --> 00:21:58,133
Steve!

283
00:21:58,259 --> 00:22:00,011
What! Get outta my car! Now! Gut!

284
00:22:00,136 --> 00:22:02,480
- You idiots!
- Why don't ya shut your mouth!

285
00:22:02,596 --> 00:22:04,018
Imbeciles!

286
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,142
Piece of shit!
Damn savages!

287
00:22:07,017 --> 00:22:09,896
That's quite a start, Stevo!
You gonna be my good luck charm.

288
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,020
I could call the cops!

289
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:13,157
I'mma call them too, dawg!

290
00:22:13,274 --> 00:22:14,526
I'll smash your face, little fucker!

291
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:16,368
Teach your son some manners!
Bitch!

292
00:22:17,361 --> 00:22:19,614
- What'd you call my mom?
- Back off!

293
00:22:21,824 --> 00:22:24,543
What d'y0u just call my mom,
you big monkey!

294
00:22:24,952 --> 00:22:26,954
I ain't got time for pigs today!

295
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:29,377
Motherfucking nigger!

296
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:31,800
- Stop it!
- You shut your mouth, bitch!

297
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:33,885
Fucking ratface!
Get out and fight me!

298
00:22:34,003 --> 00:22:36,597
Ratface! Nigger!
I think he got your point!

299
00:22:36,714 --> 00:22:38,842
Go back to your jungle
mixing coconut drinks!

300
00:22:38,966 --> 00:22:40,468
Not in my country!

301
00:22:40,593 --> 00:22:42,061
Stop being so racist!

302
00:22:42,178 --> 00:22:44,476
I'm not being racist!
He's a nigger!

303
00:22:44,597 --> 00:22:45,814
Sit your ass down.

304
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:47,308
Hi, Diane. Unfortunately...

305
00:22:57,193 --> 00:22:58,820
Excuse me, Gilles, I'm so sorry.

306
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:00,446
Forty minutes...

307
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:03,832
Yes, Diane.
I'm so happy to see you.

308
00:23:04,241 --> 00:23:06,209
Mr. Gravel's on sick leave.

309
00:23:06,786 --> 00:23:09,335
I know, it's disappointing.
But by all means, sit down.

310
00:23:09,455 --> 00:23:11,753
What favour did you want
to ask my husband?

311
00:23:11,874 --> 00:23:14,969
I'm all ears
and I cannot wait to help you.

312
00:23:39,819 --> 00:23:40,819
Yo, girl!

313
00:23:41,654 --> 00:23:43,873
D'you want me to show ya
some sweet chill-out technique?

314
00:23:46,575 --> 00:23:49,169
I'd like to hear Gilles' opinion.

315
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:52,005
I'm afraid I don't, doll.

316
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,587
Don't call me doll.

317
00:23:55,209 --> 00:23:58,554
Gilles' gone, he can't
run the place and I'm in charge now.

318
00:23:58,671 --> 00:24:01,470
Sure he'd have been very moved
by your charms,

319
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:02,842
but the decision's mine.

320
00:24:06,554 --> 00:24:07,931
You can't do this.

321
00:24:08,055 --> 00:24:09,978
The hell, I can.
You're not permanent.

322
00:24:10,099 --> 00:24:12,443
You'll be compensated.
100% legal.

323
00:24:13,686 --> 00:24:15,188
So no more Dear Abby?

324
00:24:15,521 --> 00:24:18,274
Yeah, only a real journalist
will write it.

325
00:24:22,653 --> 00:24:24,826
I'm talented; Gilles said so.

326
00:24:24,947 --> 00:24:26,119
He said I had great timing.

327
00:24:27,408 --> 00:24:30,958
I'm sure he loved the timing
of your tits in his face!

328
00:24:31,078 --> 00:24:34,878
But for me, your talent here
is to make photocopies

329
00:24:34,999 --> 00:24:36,717
and serve coffee four days a week.

330
00:24:36,834 --> 00:24:39,678
So if you got your son full time
and can't show up anymore,

331
00:24:39,795 --> 00:24:42,093
pack your shit
and sayonara, bitch!

332
00:24:44,633 --> 00:24:47,227
What are you doing in my bag?
Drop it.

333
00:24:47,636 --> 00:24:48,853
That's my stuff...

334
00:24:51,807 --> 00:24:55,653
It ain't our first ride,
Diane, is it?

335
00:24:56,979 --> 00:24:57,979
Look at me.

336
00:24:58,439 --> 00:25:01,443
We gonna be a team.
The two of us!

337
00:25:02,818 --> 00:25:04,161
I'm gonna control myself

338
00:25:04,278 --> 00:25:05,825
and I'll take care of you...

339
00:25:05,946 --> 00:25:06,993
I'mma protect you.

340
00:25:07,448 --> 00:25:10,122
Number one priority, school, ok?

341
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:12,119
I was your age when I dropped out.

342
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:14,338
And look at me now, I'm a wreck!

343
00:25:14,455 --> 00:25:17,004
No diploma, no education, nada!
A fucking loser!

344
00:25:23,964 --> 00:25:25,011
What would Dad say?

345
00:25:25,507 --> 00:25:26,599
What he'd say?

346
00:25:26,717 --> 00:25:28,640
- I dunno.
- You know it.

347
00:25:28,761 --> 00:25:29,761
You know it, come on!

348
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:33,182
Grab the future by the balls...

349
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:38,278
- Fuck the past, in the ass.
- What?

350
00:25:38,854 --> 00:25:39,901
Fuck the past, in the ass.

351
00:25:42,566 --> 00:25:44,660
Yeah! It's fucking brilliant, eh!

352
00:25:45,027 --> 00:25:46,404
Alright, what's the damage...

353
00:25:46,779 --> 00:25:47,779
You're fine.

354
00:25:47,821 --> 00:25:49,164
I dunno 'bout fine!

355
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:52,084
- You look great, promise.
- I look like a panda.

356
00:25:52,493 --> 00:25:54,916
Got shit running down my face.
Fucking hell!

357
00:26:00,626 --> 00:26:02,378
I always did that back at the Centre.

358
00:26:02,503 --> 00:26:06,303
Whenever I'd spazz
I'd hop in a bitching cold shower!

359
00:26:08,926 --> 00:26:11,224
Ma, you listening to me?

360
00:26:15,975 --> 00:26:18,023
What the hell...

361
00:26:52,136 --> 00:26:57,734
Your translator bailed last minute.
So I ended up translating...

362
00:26:59,268 --> 00:27:00,895
that kids' book, it was real cute...

363
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03,398
for a small collection...
Do you remember?

364
00:27:04,398 --> 00:27:08,323
That's it!
Exactly, yes, that's right.

365
00:27:10,863 --> 00:27:13,833
Yeah, so I've been thinking,
what if...

366
00:27:14,324 --> 00:27:15,792
A girl's gotta ask, right...

367
00:27:16,243 --> 00:27:17,620
if you had another...

368
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:21,756
little contract like that for me.

369
00:27:22,166 --> 00:27:24,669
I mean, Marthe,
I know I don't have the resume

370
00:27:24,793 --> 00:27:27,546
or the skills to translate some...

371
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:29,965
2-foot thick Ken Follett!

372
00:27:31,508 --> 00:27:33,761
I know! Ken Follett!

373
00:27:34,178 --> 00:27:36,977
Yeah, <i>as</i> if! So huge!
It's too much for me.

374
00:27:37,097 --> 00:27:40,351
But you know, some kids thingy...

375
00:27:40,476 --> 00:27:44,151
I'm thinking, "Grab the Oxford
and Bob's your uncle."

376
00:27:44,688 --> 00:27:45,905
It's not...

377
00:27:51,361 --> 00:27:53,910
Just as a hobby... time killer...

378
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,242
to kill some time.

379
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:10,931
Of course I understand, Marthe.

380
00:28:11,381 --> 00:28:14,601
No! It's no big deal, of course!

381
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:18,647
Things have been great.

382
00:28:18,764 --> 00:28:22,610
Steve's just moved back in.
We're starting...

383
00:28:23,352 --> 00:28:25,855
One chapter ends, another begins,
as they say.

384
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:57,047
I'm back, baby!

385
00:31:00,259 --> 00:31:01,761
Where you been?

386
00:31:01,885 --> 00:31:03,512
I'm waiting like a fool
to home-school ya!

387
00:31:03,637 --> 00:31:05,014
Save it for tomorrow!

388
00:31:05,138 --> 00:31:06,640
I'm still catching up.

389
00:31:06,765 --> 00:31:08,108
'The hell's that crown?

390
00:31:08,225 --> 00:31:09,226
It's my new cap!

391
00:31:12,104 --> 00:31:13,777
And what's all this?

392
00:31:18,318 --> 00:31:19,661
Damn it...

393
00:31:22,572 --> 00:31:25,576
What's that cart, for God's sake!

394
00:31:25,701 --> 00:31:26,701
It's a cart!

395
00:31:27,327 --> 00:31:29,295
No shit, but why the fuck is it
in my driveway

396
00:31:29,413 --> 00:31:32,542
and why are you loading
my fridge with that stuff!

397
00:31:32,666 --> 00:31:35,840
Look at all the shitzels I got ya!
I'mma pimp this crib.

398
00:31:35,961 --> 00:31:36,961
Don't change the subject!

399
00:31:37,004 --> 00:31:38,051
It's goddamn food!

400
00:31:38,588 --> 00:31:40,431
I ain't gonna shove it under my bed!
But wait up!

401
00:31:45,137 --> 00:31:47,515
Told ya I'd take care of ya.

402
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:55,193
You stupid motherfucking
dumb-ass idiot!

403
00:31:55,314 --> 00:31:57,692
- How much did it cost?
- It ain't your business.

404
00:31:57,816 --> 00:31:59,238
The fuck it is

405
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:01,361
when the pigs show up
'cause my son's a thief!

406
00:32:02,154 --> 00:32:03,497
I didn't steal it, it's a gift.

407
00:32:03,613 --> 00:32:04,613
That's real sweet

408
00:32:05,157 --> 00:32:07,376
but that doesn't mean
you didn't steal it.

409
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:08,584
Where d'ya steal that stuff?

410
00:32:09,077 --> 00:32:10,169
I didn't steal it!

411
00:32:10,912 --> 00:32:14,883
You tell me where you stole it all
and we're gonna bring it...

412
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,425
I didn't steal it!
Are you fucking deaf, hoe?

413
00:32:18,545 --> 00:32:19,797
I didn't steal it!

414
00:32:19,921 --> 00:32:21,923
I ain't gonna repeat it,
stupid bitch!

415
00:32:23,133 --> 00:32:24,976
Calm down, don't throw a fit.

416
00:32:25,093 --> 00:32:27,721
Mommy isn't mad,
but we'll bring everything back...

417
00:32:27,846 --> 00:32:29,848
It's yours!

418
00:32:29,973 --> 00:32:32,067
We're not bringing back anything!

419
00:32:32,184 --> 00:32:35,404
It's yours!
Don't touch any fucking thing!

420
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,649
Touch it, and I beat
the shit outta ya, you cunt!

421
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:42,699
Steve, calm down, honey.
Calm down, honey.

422
00:32:42,819 --> 00:32:46,574
Don't you fucking "honey" me
to make up for things!

423
00:32:47,366 --> 00:32:49,994
Stop taking me for a fucking idiot!

424
00:32:50,118 --> 00:32:51,290
' Got you a gift!

425
00:32:54,331 --> 00:32:57,551
Steve... it's a beautiful gift.

426
00:32:57,959 --> 00:33:00,553
Mommy likes your gift,
Mommy's happy.

427
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:01,842
But now...

428
00:33:03,173 --> 00:33:06,143
you gonna calm down,
breathe nicely...

429
00:33:06,885 --> 00:33:09,638
- ...and you're gonna take your pill...
- Give me that...

430
00:33:09,763 --> 00:33:10,763
Stop!

431
00:33:11,306 --> 00:33:13,274
You gimme that shit
and I'mma fucking end ya!

432
00:33:13,392 --> 00:33:17,695
I'mma kill you all with
your fucking meds!

433
00:33:17,813 --> 00:33:19,781
I'mma flush them meds
down the fucking drain!

434
00:33:19,898 --> 00:33:21,491
Got it?

435
00:33:21,608 --> 00:33:23,155
The meds and your head, girl...

436
00:33:23,276 --> 00:33:24,869
Stop!

437
00:33:29,324 --> 00:33:31,497
Mommy didn't wanna hurt you, baby.

438
00:33:31,618 --> 00:33:33,416
Mommy didn't mean wrong, okay?

439
00:33:33,537 --> 00:33:34,629
But Mommy...

440
00:33:35,288 --> 00:33:36,710
was choking.

441
00:33:36,832 --> 00:33:38,505
You were choking me, Steve.

442
00:33:40,252 --> 00:33:42,220
Show me your head,

443
00:33:42,337 --> 00:33:45,136
I'mma fix it and we gonna
calm down together.

444
00:33:46,341 --> 00:33:48,343
You attack me, you fucking snake?

445
00:33:49,469 --> 00:33:53,349
Mommy didn't do it on purpose!
Mommy was scared, OK?

446
00:33:54,391 --> 00:33:57,190
You wanna low blow,
you fucking whore?

447
00:33:57,686 --> 00:33:59,563
You wanna fight me?
Fine, me too.

448
00:33:59,688 --> 00:34:01,736
- Stop...
- 50-50!

449
00:34:01,857 --> 00:34:03,450
Wait till I get you!

450
00:34:03,567 --> 00:34:04,784
Stop, stop!

451
00:34:04,901 --> 00:34:06,278
Fight me you fucking wimp!

452
00:34:06,403 --> 00:34:07,495
Stop, Steve! Stop!

453
00:34:14,244 --> 00:34:16,497
You fucking cut me, bitch!

454
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:18,715
I'm fucking bleeding!

455
00:34:23,503 --> 00:34:24,925
You gotta calm down,

456
00:34:25,046 --> 00:34:27,299
otherwise Mommy can't help.

457
00:34:27,424 --> 00:34:29,847
You're dangerous, you gotta chill,
you're in a state...

458
00:34:30,302 --> 00:34:32,145
Take your pill, okay?

459
00:34:33,054 --> 00:34:34,556
I'm fucking dizzy!

460
00:34:35,557 --> 00:34:38,902
Stop it, Steve, I swear...

461
00:34:39,728 --> 00:34:41,355
You can't do this to me!

462
00:34:41,771 --> 00:34:44,866
Mommy doesn't know what
to think anymore! I'm freaking out!

463
00:34:45,525 --> 00:34:49,826
You gotta be calm if I come out!
I don't wanna fight anymore!

464
00:34:53,158 --> 00:34:54,956
Answer me, I'm talking to you!

465
00:34:55,076 --> 00:34:56,419
I'm going fucking nuts!

466
00:34:58,955 --> 00:35:00,002
Answer me!

467
00:35:12,802 --> 00:35:13,894
Steve, you there?

468
00:35:14,012 --> 00:35:15,012
Fuck off!

469
00:35:32,197 --> 00:35:33,244
Are you alright?

470
00:35:37,118 --> 00:35:38,665
Feel dizzy?

471
00:35:52,425 --> 00:35:53,802
We should...

472
00:35:55,345 --> 00:35:57,723
We should really
get him to a hospital.

473
00:35:58,139 --> 00:35:59,857
No way, no hospital...

474
00:36:29,045 --> 00:36:32,595
Her ass smells like fucking roses.
It's written in the stars.

475
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:52,776
Don't hurt him.

476
00:36:53,069 --> 00:36:54,696
- Don't try!
- Don't start!

477
00:37:00,327 --> 00:37:01,920
'The hell's that doobie?

478
00:37:02,037 --> 00:37:04,290
They give you that in hospitals
to kill the pain.

479
00:37:04,414 --> 00:37:08,135
Should we make your will?
Gimme that! Give it!

480
00:37:14,883 --> 00:37:15,883
You...

481
00:37:17,177 --> 00:37:18,303
I like you.

482
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:20,597
But you're hurting me.

483
00:37:21,389 --> 00:37:23,187
But I love it when it hurts.

484
00:37:24,392 --> 00:37:26,986
Chill out, you're still my fave,
child-beater.

485
00:37:27,103 --> 00:37:28,229
Motherfuck!

486
00:37:28,355 --> 00:37:30,653
Take it easy, I'm just playing!

487
00:37:42,202 --> 00:37:43,545
What's your name?

488
00:37:55,632 --> 00:37:56,679
Kyla.

489
00:37:57,425 --> 00:37:59,018
Two syllables, better off that way.

490
00:37:59,135 --> 00:38:00,135
I'm kidding.

491
00:38:00,595 --> 00:38:01,595
Want some coffee?

492
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:04,099
Juice? No?

493
00:38:05,308 --> 00:38:07,060
I got one of those kits too,

494
00:38:07,185 --> 00:38:09,563
somewhere in the boxes.
Didn't find it...

495
00:38:10,105 --> 00:38:12,904
I could've put some stitches
or whatever, but...

496
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:15,618
Stupid kit.

497
00:38:16,111 --> 00:38:18,239
"If your child has trouble
with a subject,

498
00:38:18,363 --> 00:38:20,866
how can you take him
a step further?"

499
00:38:21,574 --> 00:38:22,996
As further away, please.

500
00:38:24,244 --> 00:38:27,373
A column matrix is a matrix
consisting of a single column...

501
00:39:28,391 --> 00:39:29,391
Hello.

502
00:39:29,392 --> 00:39:30,439
Hello!

503
00:39:31,144 --> 00:39:33,112
Nice to meet you, Diane Després,
from across the street.

504
00:39:33,229 --> 00:39:35,857
- OK. Hello...
- Hello!

505
00:39:36,691 --> 00:39:38,113
Is Kyla there?

506
00:39:38,234 --> 00:39:39,986
No... Yes...

507
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:43,615
She's asleep.
You have a message for her?

508
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,663
A message in a bottle, yep!

509
00:39:47,619 --> 00:39:49,872
She dropped by this afternoon...

510
00:39:50,538 --> 00:39:52,791
She was real nice.

511
00:39:52,916 --> 00:39:54,088
And I appreciate it.

512
00:39:55,293 --> 00:39:57,216
I wanted to give her this.

513
00:39:57,545 --> 00:39:58,967
What did she do?

514
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:02,090
Nothing...

515
00:40:02,425 --> 00:40:05,019
Nothing... I mean... Anyway...

516
00:40:08,181 --> 00:40:12,186
I've heard it's a good one...

517
00:40:14,896 --> 00:40:15,896
Bye.

518
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:22,450
If you got nothing tonight,
would you join us for a scoff?

519
00:40:26,908 --> 00:40:29,411
This is fucking boring!

520
00:40:31,496 --> 00:40:34,466
No more green veggies, 'ight,
you know I hate it.

521
00:40:34,582 --> 00:40:36,835
You father wasn't tall,
your mom ain't any better...

522
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,679
If you wanna go past 5'7",
veggies are your friends.

523
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:42,005
How are the onions?

524
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:43,967
Brown. Ish.
I'm throwing in the veggies.

525
00:40:44,092 --> 00:40:45,264
That's right.

526
00:40:46,094 --> 00:40:48,267
<i>...at the General Hospital,
in an allegedly critical state.</i>

527
00:40:48,388 --> 00:40:49,935
<i>"A bloodcurdling death toll",</i>

528
00:40:50,265 --> 00:40:53,018
<i>says Maude Lajoie
from Montreal Police.</i>

529
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:58,319
Don't smoke there,
it'll taste like ashes!

530
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:01,660
It'll suck the odour in,
just like bread!

531
00:41:02,068 --> 00:41:04,196
Gimme that, you dork!

532
00:41:04,612 --> 00:41:05,864
<i>Indeed, the campus is,</i>

533
00:41:06,489 --> 00:41:08,241
<i>to say the least,
bathed in fear and distress.</i>

534
00:41:08,658 --> 00:41:09,658
Is it Kyla?

535
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:13,254
<i>...troubled testimonies from
students who knew young Asselin.</i>

536
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:15,627
Where's your man!

537
00:41:15,999 --> 00:41:17,125
The little neighbour was fun,

538
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:18,752
I just wanted to play with her.

539
00:41:18,877 --> 00:41:21,926
- We were still in Laval, then...
- It's my story!

540
00:41:22,046 --> 00:41:24,970
Hun, you gotta give context,
put some meat around the bone!

541
00:41:25,091 --> 00:41:26,468
We're in fucking Laval, jeez!

542
00:41:26,593 --> 00:41:28,561
People speak English in Laval, 'ight?

543
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:33,858
They speak English in Laval?

544
00:41:33,975 --> 00:41:35,272
More than you'd think.

545
00:41:35,393 --> 00:41:38,442
But I don't know a goddamn...

546
00:41:38,563 --> 00:41:40,782
Quit swearing! Goddamn, goddamn...

547
00:41:41,274 --> 00:41:44,153
Not a fucking word of English.
But when Morn and Dad

548
00:41:44,277 --> 00:41:46,200
didn't want me to get
what they were saying,

549
00:41:46,321 --> 00:41:47,368
they'd speak English.

550
00:41:47,864 --> 00:41:51,164
It'd always end with,
"Shut up! Fuck off!"

551
00:41:51,284 --> 00:41:53,286
So I'd tell Barbara
across the street,

552
00:41:53,411 --> 00:41:56,335
"Hey Barbara, come play with me!"

553
00:42:00,627 --> 00:42:02,550
No wonder he played alone.

554
00:42:03,296 --> 00:42:04,843
Great effin social skills!

555
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,387
He always liked to mingle.

556
00:42:08,927 --> 00:42:10,554
D'y0u see that!

557
00:42:10,678 --> 00:42:12,055
You Pig!

558
00:42:13,681 --> 00:42:15,103
Mingle!

559
00:42:25,818 --> 00:42:27,286
Do you like it, Kyla?

560
00:42:27,403 --> 00:42:29,246
Is mingle in the dictionary?

561
00:42:29,614 --> 00:42:30,911
Move on.

562
00:42:31,616 --> 00:42:32,993
Yes, thank you.

563
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:34,117
Besides...

564
00:42:35,703 --> 00:42:39,708
Besides fixing my leg,

565
00:42:39,832 --> 00:42:41,300
what do you do in life?

566
00:42:45,755 --> 00:42:47,382
I'm on sabbatical.

567
00:42:47,799 --> 00:42:48,799
What the hell?

568
00:42:49,092 --> 00:42:50,810
Means time off. A break.

569
00:42:50,927 --> 00:42:52,053
A break.

570
00:42:52,178 --> 00:42:53,555
From what?

571
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:04,281
What do you do, your job?

572
00:43:07,527 --> 00:43:08,528
Teacher.

573
00:43:08,903 --> 00:43:10,997
Yikes. Elementary, high school?

574
00:43:12,031 --> 00:43:13,031
High school.

575
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:17,579
Kids your age.
From grade <i>7</i> to grade 9.

576
00:43:18,538 --> 00:43:19,835
You're getting better!

577
00:43:19,956 --> 00:43:22,004
Making long sentences.

578
00:43:22,125 --> 00:43:23,126
Idiot!

579
00:43:23,251 --> 00:43:24,252
What?

580
00:43:29,799 --> 00:43:30,925
Tough one, eh?

581
00:43:31,259 --> 00:43:34,513
I was always a bit shy, but...

582
00:43:38,516 --> 00:43:41,315
I've had my language problem
for two years.

583
00:43:43,062 --> 00:43:45,110
Seven-year cycle apparently,

584
00:43:45,231 --> 00:43:47,029
it comes and goes...

585
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,698
It'll stop.

586
00:43:50,486 --> 00:43:52,454
I hope it doesn't, it's sexy.

587
00:43:53,281 --> 00:43:54,783
What? It is!

588
00:43:55,908 --> 00:43:57,501
What about you, Steve?

589
00:43:58,411 --> 00:44:00,084
I noticed the skateboard.

590
00:44:00,663 --> 00:44:02,210
It's not a skate, it's a longboard.

591
00:44:03,041 --> 00:44:04,543
You know the diff... No?

592
00:44:04,667 --> 00:44:06,795
The difference is that
the longboard...

593
00:44:06,919 --> 00:44:07,966
It's longer.

594
00:44:08,546 --> 00:44:10,423
Stay outta my story, jeez!
I'm a big boy, okay?

595
00:44:10,548 --> 00:44:11,800
I was talking to her.

596
00:44:12,675 --> 00:44:14,973
You're less mobile.

597
00:44:15,094 --> 00:44:17,597
- But...
- Stop! I'm explaining!

598
00:44:18,514 --> 00:44:20,608
I'm due for seconds! You?

599
00:44:22,018 --> 00:44:23,486
- Another shot?
- Last one...

600
00:44:31,611 --> 00:44:32,703
Cheers.

601
00:44:33,863 --> 00:44:35,035
Cheer.

602
00:44:36,074 --> 00:44:40,420
So you... moved in the 450,

603
00:44:40,536 --> 00:44:42,755
you're on sabbatical...
What about your boyfriend?

604
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:48,252
Computer programming.

605
00:44:49,253 --> 00:44:51,051
Big nerd, eh?

606
00:44:54,425 --> 00:44:56,427
Why did you leave Quebec City?

607
00:44:58,805 --> 00:45:00,398
Can I have one?

608
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:02,646
You smoke?

609
00:45:02,767 --> 00:45:04,144
No, but...

610
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:07,397
We're celebrating!

611
00:45:08,272 --> 00:45:10,070
Damn straight. Here.

612
00:45:10,191 --> 00:45:12,660
No holding back tonight.

613
00:45:12,777 --> 00:45:14,120
Be my effin' guest.

614
00:45:18,825 --> 00:45:22,921
It's my first night out
since we moved here.

615
00:45:26,207 --> 00:45:30,553
We're on transit
between Quebec and...

616
00:45:31,671 --> 00:45:33,264
God knows where.

617
00:45:35,258 --> 00:45:38,011
It depends on Patrick's job.

618
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:41,142
What about your job?

619
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:48,988
<i>I'm...</i>

620
00:45:50,022 --> 00:45:52,992
I'm not ready to work
with kids again, yet.

621
00:45:58,573 --> 00:46:02,419
We're trying something new, too.

622
00:46:06,998 --> 00:46:08,375
Steve has...

623
00:46:10,084 --> 00:46:11,176
ADHD.

624
00:46:11,502 --> 00:46:13,379
Disruptive, provoking...

625
00:46:14,338 --> 00:46:19,686
And apparently some...

626
00:46:20,887 --> 00:46:22,434
attachment disorder,

627
00:46:22,555 --> 00:46:24,478
or whatever it's called.

628
00:46:25,766 --> 00:46:28,565
He was okay when he was little.
We thought it was just...

629
00:46:31,564 --> 00:46:33,817
Hyperactivity.

630
00:46:35,776 --> 00:46:37,699
But his dad died
three years ago...

631
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:40,323
D'you mind,
it reeks of smoke in here.

632
00:46:44,285 --> 00:46:45,832
The odor...

633
00:46:46,913 --> 00:46:49,166
Smells stale.

634
00:46:55,838 --> 00:46:57,260
By the way, Steve...

635
00:47:00,092 --> 00:47:02,140
About this afternoon...

636
00:47:03,888 --> 00:47:05,890
Steve's violent, eh?

637
00:47:07,141 --> 00:47:10,315
He's a sweet boy deep down,
loads of charisma...

638
00:47:11,395 --> 00:47:13,864
When he blows a fuse,
you best scram

639
00:47:14,565 --> 00:47:15,862
'cause it gets ugly.

640
00:47:17,985 --> 00:47:19,532
But I...

641
00:47:21,739 --> 00:47:23,833
...I don't touch my boy.

642
00:47:26,953 --> 00:47:28,170
I know that.

643
00:47:29,455 --> 00:47:32,004
They quickly jump to conclusions
at the hospital.

644
00:47:33,376 --> 00:47:35,253
I know the drill.

645
00:47:35,711 --> 00:47:37,588
Youth Protection, cops...

646
00:47:38,464 --> 00:47:42,514
They'd force him back
to George-Etienne Lemieux...

647
00:47:43,719 --> 00:47:46,142
But it ain't his place.
Right?

648
00:47:48,182 --> 00:47:50,184
You don't know him,
but you saw him.

649
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:56,775
But I'm happy 'cause
it was tough being away from him.

650
00:47:58,901 --> 00:48:00,744
He's all mine now.

651
00:48:01,946 --> 00:48:03,243
And he's quite a number.

652
00:48:03,864 --> 00:48:05,787
You never get bored with Steve.

653
00:48:08,452 --> 00:48:11,797
Not a dull moment with Steve.

654
00:48:18,296 --> 00:48:20,048
There you have it.

655
00:48:20,172 --> 00:48:21,924
Fasten your seatbelt.

656
00:48:26,554 --> 00:48:27,771
Gawd help us all...

657
00:48:46,741 --> 00:48:47,788
You queen!

658
00:48:58,169 --> 00:49:00,718
That's from a mixtape his father
made a few years ago.

659
00:49:00,838 --> 00:49:03,966
All the songs from our
road trip to Cali.

660
00:49:04,091 --> 00:49:06,640
We did the coast,
all the way down to L.A.

661
00:49:07,094 --> 00:49:08,562
He's got them on repeat.

662
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,934
Effin' hell.
Alright, cake time.

663
00:49:16,645 --> 00:49:18,318
You smell like fucking heaven!

664
00:49:18,439 --> 00:49:20,658
Eau Sauvage! Christian Dior.

665
00:49:20,775 --> 00:49:22,823
My uncle gave me his leftovers.

666
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:26,823
And I still wear it. Love the smell.
You know it, Eau Sauvage?

667
00:49:27,365 --> 00:49:28,992
Don't touch that, asshole!

668
00:49:39,001 --> 00:49:40,548
Whatcha doin'?

669
00:49:40,669 --> 00:49:44,219
Drop that shit for a sec,
come dance with your son!

670
00:49:45,383 --> 00:49:46,635
D'ya know the lyrics?

671
00:49:47,802 --> 00:49:48,803
It's rather...

672
00:49:48,928 --> 00:49:50,020
...rather famous.

673
00:49:50,554 --> 00:49:53,433
Come on, sing!
She's our effin' national treasure!

674
00:50:11,742 --> 00:50:14,712
There's our Kyla!
Lettin' her gospel out!

675
00:50:15,788 --> 00:50:17,290
<i>You good, hum!</i>

676
00:51:50,883 --> 00:51:53,227
Jesus H Christ...

677
00:51:54,553 --> 00:51:55,645
Oh boy!

678
00:52:33,884 --> 00:52:36,103
Hey, Kyla! This a bad moment?

679
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:37,517
I just wanted to...

680
00:52:37,638 --> 00:52:38,638
I...

681
00:52:46,188 --> 00:52:49,909
I just wanted to tell you that...
yesterday was fun.

682
00:52:50,025 --> 00:52:52,494
Yeah, yeah, it was.
What a blast.

683
00:52:53,028 --> 00:52:54,028
Listen...

684
00:52:54,947 --> 00:52:57,746
D'ya think you could do me...

685
00:52:57,866 --> 00:52:59,618
a teeny-weeny favour?

686
00:54:04,350 --> 00:54:06,273
So, Die,

687
00:54:06,393 --> 00:54:09,738
I called Marty
right after you rang yesterday.

688
00:54:09,855 --> 00:54:12,779
Our junior section translator's
on leave with a couple gigs.

689
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:14,652
One more, one less, he doesn't care!

690
00:54:15,361 --> 00:54:17,079
So timing-wise...

691
00:54:18,030 --> 00:54:19,247
You're dead on.

692
00:54:19,698 --> 00:54:21,700
Marthe, you're making my day.

693
00:54:21,825 --> 00:54:25,079
Well if it's a "hobby",
like you said...

694
00:54:25,204 --> 00:54:28,003
you were always
such a sweet neighbour!

695
00:54:28,123 --> 00:54:30,296
It's so nice to give back, isn't it!

696
00:54:32,461 --> 00:54:34,429
How's life treating you?

697
00:54:34,546 --> 00:54:35,923
How's Steve?

698
00:54:38,676 --> 00:54:39,973
Yawn!

699
00:54:40,511 --> 00:54:42,513
This shit is useless!

700
00:54:42,638 --> 00:54:44,015
We had an agreement.

701
00:54:46,266 --> 00:54:48,689
Agreement my ass.
That was your idea.

702
00:54:48,811 --> 00:54:49,903
I don't give a shit!

703
00:54:51,063 --> 00:54:53,857
The music... please
turn it down.

704
00:54:59,279 --> 00:55:00,906
Where's the fucking O.J.

705
00:55:01,031 --> 00:55:02,874
in this motherfucking house!

706
00:55:05,369 --> 00:55:07,497
We have ten minutes left
out of our thir...

707
00:55:08,539 --> 00:55:09,540
Thirty!

708
00:55:10,541 --> 00:55:12,464
Thirty! Say it, for fuck sake!
Hang in there; You can do it!

709
00:55:13,877 --> 00:55:15,925
Steve... ten minutes!

710
00:55:16,714 --> 00:55:17,714
And then we dance.

711
00:55:21,051 --> 00:55:22,052
Ten minutes.

712
00:55:22,970 --> 00:55:24,768
And then we... we dance.

713
00:55:26,557 --> 00:55:27,774
Please calm down.

714
00:55:29,268 --> 00:55:31,646
Steve! Steve...

715
00:55:33,313 --> 00:55:36,400
No, Steve... I'm not
gonna take this!

716
00:55:38,402 --> 00:55:40,450
Come on, fight me, fucking pussy!

717
00:55:40,988 --> 00:55:43,241
Smack that face!

718
00:55:44,074 --> 00:55:46,122
I'm doing this to help, okay?

719
00:55:49,371 --> 00:55:51,840
Cute girly necklace...

720
00:55:54,835 --> 00:55:56,508
Get off me, bitch!

721
00:55:56,628 --> 00:55:58,596
Shut your mouth!

722
00:55:58,714 --> 00:56:01,058
Shut your fucking mouth!
Get your hands off me!

723
00:56:01,175 --> 00:56:04,270
And give me that necklace back
before I crush your skull!

724
00:56:04,386 --> 00:56:07,435
You got it? You got it now?!

725
00:56:09,016 --> 00:56:11,018
That's what you want, eh?

726
00:56:12,102 --> 00:56:15,026
You love it that way, right?

727
00:56:30,996 --> 00:56:34,045
Do I bring up your dead father?

728
00:56:35,083 --> 00:56:37,006
Do I fucking bring that up?

729
00:56:40,672 --> 00:56:42,674
So shut it tight,

730
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:46,646
sit your ass on the sofa,
and hold your fucking breath!

731
00:57:55,205 --> 00:57:56,457
Steve...

732
00:57:56,957 --> 00:57:58,709
Just go! I hate you!

733
00:58:17,644 --> 00:58:18,987
<i>Take your time, Diane.</i>

734
00:58:19,688 --> 00:58:20,814
<i>OK.</i>

735
00:58:22,232 --> 00:58:23,232
<i>What?</i>

736
00:58:23,483 --> 00:58:24,609
<i>It's nothing.</i>

737
00:58:25,193 --> 00:58:26,445
Come on, tell me.

738
00:58:26,570 --> 00:58:28,618
No, it's dumb, forget it.

739
00:58:28,739 --> 00:58:29,831
Come on, you tease!

740
00:58:29,948 --> 00:58:31,541
It's dumb...

741
00:58:31,658 --> 00:58:33,035
I'm not at the top of your list...

742
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:34,503
Come on, you tease!

743
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:36,543
You sneaky little tease!

744
00:58:36,663 --> 00:58:38,165
- It's dumb, forget it.
- No, no, no!

745
00:58:38,290 --> 00:58:39,542
It's nothing.

746
00:58:39,666 --> 00:58:40,792
Come on!

747
00:58:40,918 --> 00:58:42,920
It was a pleasure catching up.

748
00:58:43,045 --> 00:58:44,045
Tell me!

749
00:58:44,087 --> 00:58:45,839
You won't be disappointed.

750
00:58:45,964 --> 00:58:47,637
You gotta tell me right away.

751
00:58:48,342 --> 00:58:50,094
Tell me now,
cause I'll go to bed thinking,

752
00:58:50,218 --> 00:58:52,937
"Gee, what did she want?
Was it important, was it not imp..."

753
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:54,648
I need an advance.

754
00:59:03,231 --> 00:59:04,483
$20 bills?

755
00:59:05,317 --> 00:59:08,161
Diane! $20 bills?

756
00:59:10,781 --> 00:59:13,409
Whatever's best for you.
What's it to me...

757
00:59:18,747 --> 00:59:19,999
$20 bills, then.

758
00:59:20,749 --> 00:59:22,217
All in $20 bills, please.

759
01:00:32,988 --> 01:00:34,615
I'm a good lad, ya know.

760
01:01:29,544 --> 01:01:30,921
Diane!

761
01:01:34,341 --> 01:01:35,341
Wait a minute!

762
01:01:41,598 --> 01:01:43,100
Wait up, lemme help!

763
01:01:49,606 --> 01:01:50,983
This isn't your day, eh?

764
01:01:51,441 --> 01:01:56,493
You win some, you lose some,
that's life.

765
01:01:59,908 --> 01:02:01,000
How are you guys?

766
01:02:01,451 --> 01:02:02,451
Us guys?

767
01:02:04,204 --> 01:02:05,421
You and your son.

768
01:02:06,373 --> 01:02:08,626
Same old, same old.

769
01:02:09,709 --> 01:02:12,178
And you? You been busy these days?

770
01:02:13,046 --> 01:02:15,140
There's always something going on
at the municipal court.

771
01:02:15,674 --> 01:02:17,722
You wouldn't believe the cases I get.

772
01:02:17,843 --> 01:02:18,843
I can imagine...

773
01:02:20,804 --> 01:02:22,021
Goddamn...

774
01:02:23,598 --> 01:02:24,941
Can's broken, awesome.

775
01:02:26,643 --> 01:02:27,815
Well, lemme tell ya...

776
01:02:28,603 --> 01:02:29,650
You're one...

777
01:02:30,188 --> 01:02:31,188
pretty...

778
01:02:31,481 --> 01:02:32,653
...pretty gal.

779
01:02:35,819 --> 01:02:39,073
Come on! Dressed up
like a dog's breakfast,

780
01:02:39,197 --> 01:02:41,199
on all fours, middle of the street!

781
01:02:41,324 --> 01:02:42,871
Nah, nah, don't try!

782
01:02:44,411 --> 01:02:46,038
See? That's it!

783
01:02:46,746 --> 01:02:48,214
That's what's sexy!

784
01:02:48,331 --> 01:02:49,628
Is you don't even know it.

785
01:03:00,635 --> 01:03:02,387
You're funny, Paul.

786
01:03:29,456 --> 01:03:31,424
Spic and span, eh!

787
01:03:42,260 --> 01:03:44,308
Fuckin' Last House on the Left,
what the hell...

788
01:04:01,905 --> 01:04:03,327
Are you guys outside?

789
01:04:05,909 --> 01:04:07,331
Surprise!

790
01:04:08,536 --> 01:04:11,836
Holy shit! You goddam crazies!
I almost had a heart attack!

791
01:04:11,957 --> 01:04:14,176
I wanted to piss
so I tied a knot in my dick

792
01:04:14,292 --> 01:04:15,965
just to see your face!

793
01:04:16,586 --> 01:04:19,840
We were done with math and chem
so we fixed a snack.

794
01:04:20,382 --> 01:04:21,759
D'ya notice how her stutter's better?

795
01:04:21,883 --> 01:04:24,352
That's the Steve touch, baby.

796
01:04:25,011 --> 01:04:26,354
They just can't effin resist me.

797
01:04:27,514 --> 01:04:28,561
Forgive him.

798
01:04:33,728 --> 01:04:35,230
Well, can I give a hand?

799
01:04:36,106 --> 01:04:39,280
Table's set, food's served, Jesus!

800
01:04:39,401 --> 01:04:40,618
You can relax.

801
01:04:40,735 --> 01:04:42,237
Relax, breathe!

802
01:04:45,323 --> 01:04:46,415
Can he?

803
01:04:46,533 --> 01:04:49,503
Look... what happens in Vegas...

804
01:04:54,207 --> 01:04:56,175
Well... thank you, Kyla!
Thank you!

805
01:04:57,961 --> 01:04:59,383
And I'm a piece of shit?

806
01:05:06,344 --> 01:05:09,018
You're no piece of shit, hell no...

807
01:05:15,562 --> 01:05:19,032
You're a prince, baby!
That's what you are!

808
01:05:19,524 --> 01:05:22,152
And we fixed you a royal brunch!

809
01:05:22,277 --> 01:05:25,156
We live like goddamn kings!
Is this Versailles or what?

810
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:26,998
Have you seen this?

811
01:05:27,115 --> 01:05:28,662
Versailles!

812
01:05:28,783 --> 01:05:32,083
Those baloney rolls
are screaming my name!

813
01:05:32,871 --> 01:05:34,589
You guys, let's take a pic!
Come on.

814
01:05:34,706 --> 01:05:35,923
Let's do it, guys.

815
01:05:37,208 --> 01:05:39,927
- You come here. Come, Kyla.
- Wait...

816
01:05:40,795 --> 01:05:42,422
But my hair...

817
01:05:42,922 --> 01:05:44,344
Your hair's sick.

818
01:05:44,466 --> 01:05:45,934
But that light's harsh, Stevo...

819
01:05:46,259 --> 01:05:48,227
Let's switch sides, alright...

820
01:06:19,834 --> 01:06:21,677
<i>We found out in March.</i>

821
01:06:22,837 --> 01:06:24,384
<i>End of March 2010.</i>

822
01:06:27,884 --> 01:06:30,182
Three weeks later,
I was signing papers for his casket.

823
01:06:30,303 --> 01:06:31,303
Bingo!

824
01:06:32,430 --> 01:06:33,898
That was something.

825
01:06:34,724 --> 01:06:37,648
First off, we moved.

826
01:06:38,436 --> 01:06:39,983
Left the burbs.

827
01:06:40,855 --> 01:06:43,404
Rich was up to his neck in debt.

828
01:06:43,525 --> 01:06:45,573
I sold the house,

829
01:06:45,693 --> 01:06:48,446
paid the bills,
set the counter straight.

830
01:06:48,905 --> 01:06:51,749
And that's when Steve...

831
01:06:51,866 --> 01:06:55,211
Vandalism, petty theft,
the crying and cursing...

832
01:06:55,328 --> 01:06:57,205
All that bullshit.

833
01:06:59,249 --> 01:07:03,846
Then he got diagnosed
and I placed him.

834
01:07:03,962 --> 01:07:05,134
I mean, I placed him.

835
01:07:08,091 --> 01:07:12,062
And what about you?
I did ask you before, didn't I?

836
01:07:12,762 --> 01:07:16,141
You used to live in Quebec City?
Why did y'all move here?

837
01:07:26,109 --> 01:07:27,361
I know Quebec, you know.

838
01:07:27,861 --> 01:07:30,956
We often went for Richard's job.
I always ended up there.

839
01:07:36,035 --> 01:07:37,878
What did Richard do?

840
01:07:39,831 --> 01:07:43,051
He worked in the inventors business.

841
01:07:43,751 --> 01:07:46,630
He...
He invented...

842
01:07:46,754 --> 01:07:47,971
I never really got it but...

843
01:07:48,089 --> 01:07:49,306
I mean, I did but anyway...

844
01:07:49,424 --> 01:07:52,598
It was a microwave thingy...

845
01:07:54,512 --> 01:07:56,981
He named it the Heater-Waver.

846
01:07:58,558 --> 01:08:00,401
You know it?

847
01:08:00,518 --> 01:08:02,941
The Heater-Waver, yes!

848
01:08:03,062 --> 01:08:05,941
Get outta here!
No effin way!

849
01:08:06,065 --> 01:08:07,817
It did good, yeah, it was a hit!

850
01:08:07,942 --> 01:08:10,741
Everyone had the Heater-Waver!
My sister, my sister-in-law!

851
01:08:10,862 --> 01:08:12,079
Really?

852
01:08:12,197 --> 01:08:13,244
Well, hello!

853
01:08:14,073 --> 01:08:17,247
We made a shitload of money
on that one, but it didn't last...

854
01:08:18,036 --> 01:08:20,755
Richie started thinking big,
next thing, I was thinking big...

855
01:08:20,872 --> 01:08:23,500
Of course... it was big!

856
01:08:23,625 --> 01:08:26,799
We all did, but better think big
than small, am I right or what?!

857
01:08:27,295 --> 01:08:30,174
And then...
the Americans called.

858
01:08:30,298 --> 01:08:33,268
- Americans are never far...
- They know best, don't they...

859
01:08:33,384 --> 01:08:34,761
When there's money to be made!

860
01:08:34,886 --> 01:08:38,390
So they got their hands on it...
and that's that.

861
01:08:38,515 --> 01:08:39,858
Effin bunch of crooks!

862
01:08:41,559 --> 01:08:43,812
Yup.
What's done is done.

863
01:09:00,453 --> 01:09:04,424
Are you looking for a job?

864
01:09:06,793 --> 01:09:10,388
One of my friends gave me
some translation gig.

865
01:09:10,505 --> 01:09:12,883
Not really my job, but...

866
01:09:14,133 --> 01:09:17,057
at least I'll make it
to the holidays, now...

867
01:09:18,721 --> 01:09:21,850
I mean, Christmas' right around
the corner... But then there's...

868
01:09:23,601 --> 01:09:27,231
All that clutter in the basement.
The old furniture.

869
01:09:27,355 --> 01:09:29,574
I've got no room for that here.

870
01:09:30,191 --> 01:09:31,443
And it's from another life...

871
01:09:31,568 --> 01:09:33,161
it's got nothing
to do with me anymore.

872
01:09:34,904 --> 01:09:38,078
I was thinking I could...
you know... sell it.

873
01:09:38,199 --> 01:09:42,579
Like a sort of
garage sale type-a-thing...

874
01:09:43,663 --> 01:09:45,336
I don't know what it's worth but...

875
01:09:47,125 --> 01:09:50,550
Must be worth something, at least.
Fancy dinner or some night out...

876
01:09:50,670 --> 01:09:53,219
Makes a lil' bundle of dough...
Bundle here, bundle there...

877
01:09:53,339 --> 01:09:54,682
We'll end up going somewhere!

878
01:09:58,011 --> 01:09:59,684
That little wine's not bad, eh?

879
01:10:00,722 --> 01:10:04,272
And you... is there anyone?
Anyone special, I mean?

880
01:10:06,227 --> 01:10:07,444
I'm a jingle lady!

881
01:10:10,815 --> 01:10:12,408
Sorry.

882
01:10:12,525 --> 01:10:15,369
I meant single.

883
01:10:15,486 --> 01:10:17,705
I'm surprised.
You're so pretty!

884
01:10:18,698 --> 01:10:19,824
You're pretty, Die.

885
01:10:19,949 --> 01:10:21,576
You're real sweet, but...

886
01:10:22,869 --> 01:10:26,248
<i>Pretty won't geisha any'.!</i>

887
01:10:27,081 --> 01:10:28,298
Life's like poker:

888
01:10:28,875 --> 01:10:30,752
If you ain't got a good pair,
you're in deep shit!

889
01:10:42,889 --> 01:10:44,562
Time to flat call, I guess!

890
01:10:48,394 --> 01:10:50,396
No hooters, no poker!

891
01:10:50,521 --> 01:10:53,274
Might as well play with myself!

892
01:10:56,194 --> 01:10:58,288
Or watch some TV!

893
01:10:58,946 --> 01:11:02,667
I don't even have a TV!
No TV, no candy, sweet fuck all!

894
01:11:03,576 --> 01:11:05,795
No bazookas in my 34A!

895
01:11:05,912 --> 01:11:07,630
But a big one in my mouth!

896
01:11:10,875 --> 01:11:13,219
Tastes good!
They're my favourite!

897
01:11:14,671 --> 01:11:15,888
That one was effin huge!

898
01:11:16,005 --> 01:11:18,508
Quite the mission!

899
01:11:20,385 --> 01:11:22,058
I got cramps in my face!

900
01:11:23,221 --> 01:11:24,973
I'mma help it down the drain!

901
01:11:32,021 --> 01:11:33,273
Stop it, Die!

902
01:11:33,606 --> 01:11:34,698
Sorry!

903
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:37,653
You're gonna kill me, Die!

904
01:11:39,195 --> 01:11:40,788
Do you get it?

905
01:12:16,149 --> 01:12:18,777
Holy fuck!
Should've seen your face!

906
01:12:18,901 --> 01:12:20,528
You scared me...

907
01:12:21,988 --> 01:12:24,036
It's just me.
Don't worry, babe.

908
01:12:27,326 --> 01:12:29,203
Don't call me babe.

909
01:12:29,328 --> 01:12:30,921
'lght. I won't.

910
01:12:34,208 --> 01:12:35,255
It's okay.

911
01:12:38,379 --> 01:12:40,097
Are you done with
your history homework?

912
01:12:40,214 --> 01:12:41,807
I was just about to,

913
01:12:41,924 --> 01:12:44,848
but I can't see shit
'cause of the blackout.

914
01:12:47,805 --> 01:12:48,805
There.

915
01:13:02,612 --> 01:13:04,865
I'm a fucking pro, eh?

916
01:13:06,324 --> 01:13:07,450
Mom?

917
01:13:08,326 --> 01:13:12,502
Dad wants to know where you put
the candles and flashlights.

918
01:13:19,962 --> 01:13:23,307
They're in a box in the basement.
He knows where!

919
01:13:24,509 --> 01:13:25,761
Thank you.

920
01:13:29,347 --> 01:13:30,724
I meant to tell ya...

921
01:13:33,142 --> 01:13:34,268
about earlier...

922
01:13:34,936 --> 01:13:36,938
about this morning.
I wanted to apologize, first.

923
01:13:38,314 --> 01:13:40,032
I'm sorry and...

924
01:13:45,571 --> 01:13:47,539
I like it when you teach me stuff.

925
01:13:49,283 --> 01:13:53,959
And... I get it
when you explain shit to me.

926
01:13:55,331 --> 01:13:57,425
For that reason,

927
01:13:57,542 --> 01:14:00,466
it makes me wanna ask you,
do you wanna keep doing it?

928
01:14:04,715 --> 01:14:07,138
Mom!
Dinner's ready!

929
01:14:13,975 --> 01:14:15,727
Thanks, I'm coming.

930
01:14:17,228 --> 01:14:19,526
That way...

931
01:14:19,647 --> 01:14:22,275
I could pass my exams
at the end of the year, and...

932
01:14:22,775 --> 01:14:24,402
'cause when I'm old enough,

933
01:14:24,527 --> 01:14:28,327
I'll apply to an Art school,
in the States.

934
01:14:28,447 --> 01:14:29,539
Juilliard.

935
01:14:31,909 --> 01:14:34,287
And I think Die likes you.

936
01:14:34,412 --> 01:14:36,756
We like you, we're chill.

937
01:14:37,623 --> 01:14:40,092
You're on sabbatical
so if you stay with me,

938
01:14:40,209 --> 01:14:44,134
she could find a day job
and we'd get it going again.

939
01:14:49,552 --> 01:14:51,975
I don't mean to interrupt
but the food's gonna get cold!

940
01:17:47,313 --> 01:17:48,781
Show me!

941
01:17:57,531 --> 01:17:58,623
Come back here, you dork!

942
01:17:58,741 --> 01:18:00,334
Get your ass here!

943
01:18:02,161 --> 01:18:04,289
Chill out!

944
01:18:05,623 --> 01:18:08,046
You goddamn stupid punk!
I'mma come and getcha!

945
01:18:14,548 --> 01:18:16,141
What the hell are you doing?!

946
01:18:20,805 --> 01:18:22,807
Stop encouraging him!

947
01:18:22,932 --> 01:18:25,276
I'm trying to raise that kid!

948
01:18:32,650 --> 01:18:34,118
I'm free!

949
01:18:34,693 --> 01:18:36,912
I am free!

950
01:18:42,952 --> 01:18:44,920
D'y0u like ital dente?

951
01:18:45,037 --> 01:18:47,506
I'm from a special school of thought.

952
01:18:47,623 --> 01:18:52,254
I like my pasta just a tiny tiny bit
harder than al dente.

953
01:18:52,378 --> 01:18:53,880
Well, it's al dente now!

954
01:18:54,004 --> 01:18:56,427
Strain them, illico pesto!

955
01:18:57,049 --> 01:19:00,019
- Fail! Keep your day job, please!
- Why don't ya shut it!

956
01:19:00,970 --> 01:19:03,473
Says here the mayo
may contain mustard.

957
01:19:03,597 --> 01:19:05,975
Yeah, they always write that BS,
even for cookies!

958
01:19:06,100 --> 01:19:07,100
I hate fucking mustard.

959
01:19:07,226 --> 01:19:10,025
Just put two spoonfuls, just two.

960
01:19:10,855 --> 01:19:11,855
What the...?

961
01:19:12,815 --> 01:19:15,364
Don't put the dressing yet,
it'll make the lettuce soggy.

962
01:19:15,484 --> 01:19:17,657
Kyla, start 'em pine nuts!
On low.

963
01:19:17,778 --> 01:19:19,246
So they don't burn!

964
01:19:23,826 --> 01:19:26,170
You've been served, ma'am.

965
01:19:26,912 --> 01:19:28,129
Good evening.

966
01:19:43,053 --> 01:19:45,431
It may contain traces of mustard.

967
01:19:46,015 --> 01:19:48,438
<i>...your son...</i>

968
01:19:48,559 --> 01:19:52,063
<i>...set fire to the cafeteria...</i>

969
01:19:52,188 --> 01:19:54,156
<i>This fire caused physical
and moral damages...</i>

970
01:19:54,273 --> 01:19:55,820
Pine nuts are ready!

971
01:19:55,941 --> 01:19:58,069
Take 'em out of the pan
so they won't burn!

972
01:19:58,819 --> 01:20:00,071
<i>...to our son Kevin Julien.</i>

973
01:20:00,196 --> 01:20:02,073
Put the lid on, so they stay moist.

974
01:20:05,034 --> 01:20:06,034
<i>75% of his face...</i>

975
01:20:06,118 --> 01:20:07,415
<i>...skin graft...</i>

976
01:20:07,536 --> 01:20:09,004
Can we change the subject?

977
01:20:11,874 --> 01:20:14,297
<i>Please act accordingly.</i>

978
01:20:44,073 --> 01:20:45,450
Pour the dressing.

979
01:20:45,574 --> 01:20:49,624
Stop poking my face with that shit!

980
01:20:49,745 --> 01:20:50,997
I'mma look like a slut!

981
01:20:51,121 --> 01:20:53,044
You already look like one!

982
01:20:53,791 --> 01:20:54,791
Stop it!

983
01:20:55,709 --> 01:20:57,461
That sweater's way too small.

984
01:20:57,586 --> 01:21:00,214
It's got a big spot, like you
slept in a pile of shit.

985
01:21:00,339 --> 01:21:01,716
Pile of shit, yourself!

986
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:03,342
Mind your own, kiss ass!

987
01:21:03,676 --> 01:21:06,304
Is the kid that set the canteen
on fire a pile of shit?

988
01:21:06,428 --> 01:21:08,305
The kid whose mom's
meeting with the neighbour

989
01:21:08,430 --> 01:21:09,852
who's helping for free

990
01:21:10,182 --> 01:21:12,059
so you, don't end up
at George-Etienne Lemieux?

991
01:21:12,184 --> 01:21:14,733
- I'm not going back!
- I know, you dumb-ass!

992
01:21:14,853 --> 01:21:17,072
But for fuck's sake,
we gotta lawyer our asses up.

993
01:21:17,189 --> 01:21:19,112
We can't just sit and wait for God

994
01:21:19,233 --> 01:21:21,702
to come down on an effin cloud!

995
01:21:21,819 --> 01:21:24,413
I have a bird-nest on my head!

996
01:21:24,989 --> 01:21:25,989
I'm not a tumbleweed!

997
01:21:26,073 --> 01:21:27,450
Wait...

998
01:21:28,325 --> 01:21:29,542
I'm getting there.

999
01:21:29,660 --> 01:21:30,660
I know.

1000
01:21:38,627 --> 01:21:41,221
Fucking douche.

1001
01:21:42,756 --> 01:21:45,054
10 max, I'm peacing out.

1002
01:21:45,676 --> 01:21:48,976
No one's pissing till I say so.

1003
01:21:49,096 --> 01:21:51,064
Steve, you have to do it.

1004
01:21:51,181 --> 01:21:54,060
2-3 hours of your precious time,
suck it up.

1005
01:21:54,184 --> 01:21:55,184
Fuck that shit!

1006
01:21:55,936 --> 01:21:58,234
I'm done with that dirty mouth!
Fuck fuck fuck!

1007
01:21:58,355 --> 01:21:59,356
Back off!

1008
01:21:59,481 --> 01:22:01,154
I've had it 'bout up to here!

1009
01:22:01,275 --> 01:22:03,949
We'll make a good impression tonight!

1010
01:22:04,069 --> 01:22:06,367
Are you blind or you just dumb!

1011
01:22:06,488 --> 01:22:10,413
That dick doesn't wanna help us,
he just wants in your panties!

1012
01:22:22,838 --> 01:22:24,215
We'll be right out!

1013
01:22:24,340 --> 01:22:25,592
No problemo!

1014
01:22:28,844 --> 01:22:31,438
As usual...
Thank you.

1015
01:22:36,352 --> 01:22:37,353
Good luck.

1016
01:22:37,478 --> 01:22:38,730
We'll do what we can.

1017
01:22:41,732 --> 01:22:43,609
You coming, cutie?

1018
01:22:47,654 --> 01:22:48,780
You wait!

1019
01:22:49,948 --> 01:22:50,948
Stay here.

1020
01:22:54,536 --> 01:22:56,538
There's no two ways about it.

1021
01:22:57,664 --> 01:22:59,587
Mom's got a couple gigs
here and there

1022
01:22:59,708 --> 01:23:01,426
for bills and groceries.

1023
01:23:02,544 --> 01:23:04,592
Not a lawsuit, not a lawyer.

1024
01:23:05,923 --> 01:23:08,802
If we don't defend ourselves...

1025
01:23:13,013 --> 01:23:14,560
We gotta put some water
in our wine...

1026
01:23:15,599 --> 01:23:16,771
Huh. baby?

1027
01:23:17,351 --> 01:23:20,070
Ever heard that expression?

1028
01:23:22,189 --> 01:23:26,569
We stick together, tonight.
Mom's there for ya, and vice versa.

1029
01:23:30,697 --> 01:23:31,697
We good?

1030
01:23:49,591 --> 01:23:50,717
Wheeeeretoooooo!

1031
01:23:52,719 --> 01:23:53,720
Alrighty!

1032
01:23:54,596 --> 01:23:57,315
It's scary,
how nothing's changed here.

1033
01:23:57,433 --> 01:24:00,653
That secret sauce
is what scares me!

1034
01:24:00,769 --> 01:24:02,362
Those freaking secrets scare me.

1035
01:24:03,272 --> 01:24:05,024
I don't get it.

1036
01:24:05,607 --> 01:24:06,733
I just don't.

1037
01:24:07,568 --> 01:24:09,286
I don't get them burgers!

1038
01:24:09,403 --> 01:24:11,497
Who's into that stuff
except for tourists

1039
01:24:11,613 --> 01:24:13,206
who've never seen flat bread?

1040
01:24:13,699 --> 01:24:17,169
I was surprised
you brought up that place.

1041
01:24:18,287 --> 01:24:22,633
Who'd be into swaggy homemade burgers

1042
01:24:22,749 --> 01:24:24,672
with nice hot sauce

1043
01:24:24,793 --> 01:24:29,139
and melting cheddar
when you got that effin orange cheese

1044
01:24:29,256 --> 01:24:32,726
from some obese-packed
American dive, eh?

1045
01:24:33,677 --> 01:24:36,476
I guess my dad was just
some random tourist.

1046
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:45,281
He sure knows how to liven it up.

1047
01:24:55,199 --> 01:24:57,952
I hope you like karaoke, Steve.

1048
01:24:58,076 --> 01:25:00,920
'Cause I got it all planned out!

1049
01:25:01,038 --> 01:25:02,756
You kidding, we love it!

1050
01:25:02,873 --> 01:25:04,967
I told ya on the phone, he sings!

1051
01:25:05,083 --> 01:25:06,630
I don't sing, I dance!

1052
01:25:08,212 --> 01:25:10,510
You can do both at once,
you're no dummy.

1053
01:25:12,466 --> 01:25:16,721
You gonna smack like a cow
without manners all night, or what?

1054
01:25:20,015 --> 01:25:23,064
Wait until I sing Eye of the Tiger,

1055
01:25:23,185 --> 01:25:25,028
you'll loosen up.

1056
01:25:26,230 --> 01:25:28,733
Freakin' blast from the past!

1057
01:25:29,316 --> 01:25:31,068
I've been hooked since '82.

1058
01:25:32,110 --> 01:25:35,614
I saw it maybe 11 times,

1059
01:25:35,739 --> 01:25:37,616
and I keep forgetting how it ends!

1060
01:25:39,618 --> 01:25:41,996
I have the Scarf ace poster
on my fridge.

1061
01:25:44,915 --> 01:25:47,043
But about...

1062
01:25:47,793 --> 01:25:50,842
about Steve...

1063
01:25:51,713 --> 01:25:54,182
'Cause our Steve here got himself...

1064
01:25:56,176 --> 01:25:58,679
in a fine mess...

1065
01:26:00,556 --> 01:26:01,648
He's a pro.

1066
01:26:02,891 --> 01:26:05,064
It's about time we...

1067
01:26:05,894 --> 01:26:08,773
get to the bottom of things...

1068
01:26:22,869 --> 01:26:27,170
- Whatcha gonna sing tonight, Steve?
- Yeah, what?

1069
01:26:39,970 --> 01:26:44,646
Get the fuck out!
I just can't believe it!

1070
01:26:44,766 --> 01:26:46,814
Eyes like this, jaw-dropped!

1071
01:26:46,935 --> 01:26:48,983
He's standing frozen,
drooling on the floor.

1072
01:26:49,104 --> 01:26:52,153
Poor girl's got her money's worth!

1073
01:26:52,858 --> 01:26:55,281
Her dude shows up,
middle of the night!

1074
01:26:55,402 --> 01:26:57,075
Busts her with the stripper,

1075
01:26:57,195 --> 01:26:59,368
his schlong
sticking outta his speedo!

1076
01:27:00,866 --> 01:27:02,493
One big schlong!

1077
01:27:02,826 --> 01:27:03,952
Steve, buddy?

1078
01:27:04,870 --> 01:27:06,247
What's our song, kiddo!

1079
01:27:07,581 --> 01:27:08,628
You know what?

1080
01:27:08,749 --> 01:27:10,342
Why don't we pick a song,

1081
01:27:10,459 --> 01:27:11,961
and sing your mom some duet,

1082
01:27:12,085 --> 01:27:13,928
a beautiful song
for a beautiful woman.

1083
01:27:18,842 --> 01:27:22,892
Hey Missy! Same thing, here!
Die, seconds?

1084
01:27:23,013 --> 01:27:24,013
Bring it on!

1085
01:27:24,014 --> 01:27:25,937
Make that two!

1086
01:27:26,266 --> 01:27:27,267
Thanks!

1087
01:27:27,392 --> 01:27:29,520
<i>So...</i> my dear Paul...

1088
01:27:32,272 --> 01:27:36,743
About Steve and that whole shebang,

1089
01:27:36,860 --> 01:27:40,581
we better talk it through
before we're too wasted to speak!

1090
01:27:41,198 --> 01:27:42,871
I'm never too wasted.

1091
01:27:43,575 --> 01:27:48,630
Seriously, Paul,
could you direct...

1092
01:27:51,291 --> 01:27:53,669
our direction...

1093
01:27:53,794 --> 01:27:56,843
in this crazy whatchamacallit?

1094
01:27:56,963 --> 01:27:58,681
The only thing you gotta know

1095
01:27:58,799 --> 01:28:00,893
is that when it comes to a lawsuit,

1096
01:28:02,177 --> 01:28:05,977
- it's all about the angle.
- Oh, yeah...

1097
01:28:06,098 --> 01:28:07,850
What's your angle?

1098
01:28:07,974 --> 01:28:09,942
Is it this one?

1099
01:28:10,060 --> 01:28:11,060
Or this one?

1100
01:28:11,103 --> 01:28:12,946
I dunno, you're the boss!

1101
01:28:13,021 --> 01:28:14,021
Or this one?

1102
01:28:14,022 --> 01:28:15,569
That ain't the same!

1103
01:28:16,024 --> 01:28:17,401
That's another one!

1104
01:28:17,526 --> 01:28:19,403
It's fragile, but it's the angle.

1105
01:28:19,528 --> 01:28:23,408
Seriously, drop by my place
tomorrow morning.

1106
01:28:23,532 --> 01:28:26,126
Doesn't feel right talking about it
with Steve around,

1107
01:28:26,243 --> 01:28:28,371
we should be partying,
kicking back a few!

1108
01:28:28,704 --> 01:28:30,297
Are you a cottage kinda girl?

1109
01:28:30,414 --> 01:28:34,885
Well, cottage, just like that, eh?

1110
01:28:35,001 --> 01:28:38,881
My cottage yeah, we could go
for a day, or two, or three

1111
01:28:39,297 --> 01:28:42,847
whenever I don't have my daughter
and you uh... I dunno...

1112
01:28:42,968 --> 01:28:43,968
I dunno...

1113
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:10,750
- Hey, you got Vivo Per Lei?
- Huh?

1114
01:29:10,871 --> 01:29:12,088
Vivo Per Lei, the song.

1115
01:29:12,205 --> 01:29:15,334
Andrea Bocelli, yup, I have it.

1116
01:29:15,459 --> 01:29:19,134
You have the duet version,
the guy and the girl?

1117
01:29:19,254 --> 01:29:21,757
- I do.
- You wouldn't sing it with me, eh?

1118
01:29:21,882 --> 01:29:23,930
Sure! Could be fun!

1119
01:29:24,259 --> 01:29:26,011
- Go on, I'll be right up.
- Thanks.

1120
01:29:44,237 --> 01:29:46,786
Hey, it's our International Steve!

1121
01:29:47,783 --> 01:29:49,535
Steve's the shy type but,

1122
01:29:49,659 --> 01:29:52,503
give him some time
and he's stealing the show!

1123
01:29:53,163 --> 01:29:57,043
Steve's the mingle-type.

1124
01:30:14,476 --> 01:30:18,322
I'm sure that ain't a favorite here!

1125
01:30:20,065 --> 01:30:21,783
Canada's got talent, eh!

1126
01:30:23,610 --> 01:30:25,863
Who's that homo!

1127
01:30:58,645 --> 01:31:00,192
Check this out, guys!

1128
01:31:46,234 --> 01:31:49,829
Sing, faggot, Sing!

1129
01:32:21,978 --> 01:32:25,357
You lemme sing my song
and shut your fucking cunt!

1130
01:32:25,482 --> 01:32:29,157
You lemme sing
or I'mma fucking rip your face!

1131
01:32:29,277 --> 01:32:31,905
- Chill out, man!
- Fuck off, asshole!

1132
01:32:32,030 --> 01:32:33,452
Steve, stop right now!

1133
01:32:33,573 --> 01:32:37,043
Motherfucker!
I'mma fucking kill you, ok!

1134
01:32:39,287 --> 01:32:43,713
You punks get the fuck outta my sight
before I call the pigs!

1135
01:32:43,833 --> 01:32:45,961
Come on, scram!

1136
01:32:47,837 --> 01:32:50,181
- Steve, come here!
- I'm going home!

1137
01:32:50,298 --> 01:32:53,097
Do what you want.
Fuck him, I don't give a shit.

1138
01:32:53,218 --> 01:32:55,892
Listen to your Mom, come here,
we'll talk like adults.

1139
01:32:56,012 --> 01:32:58,481
Adults who chugged 27 beers?
No thanks.

1140
01:32:58,598 --> 01:33:01,272
We're doing this for you, son,
not for me!

1141
01:33:01,393 --> 01:33:03,145
You're the one in trouble
with the law,

1142
01:33:03,269 --> 01:33:04,486
we're looking for solutions here!

1143
01:33:04,604 --> 01:33:06,197
In a Karaoke bar?

1144
01:33:06,314 --> 01:33:08,658
Wake up, Diane,
he just wants to bone you!

1145
01:33:08,775 --> 01:33:11,904
Hey you watch your mouth!
We're older than you!

1146
01:33:12,028 --> 01:33:13,075
Older my ass!

1147
01:33:13,196 --> 01:33:14,243
Stop it, Steve!

1148
01:33:14,906 --> 01:33:18,251
Why? So I can sing while
that gaylord rubs his dick on ya!

1149
01:33:18,368 --> 01:33:20,041
That's enough, you little shit!

1150
01:33:20,161 --> 01:33:21,287
Don't start!

1151
01:33:21,913 --> 01:33:23,711
- Watch your goddam mouth with her!
- We're all drunk...

1152
01:33:23,832 --> 01:33:26,085
D'you even hear yourself?
Who d'you think you are?

1153
01:33:26,209 --> 01:33:30,134
She's going through hell for ya!
Because of ya!

1154
01:33:30,255 --> 01:33:33,475
She gives you everything,
her cash, her time, her whole life!

1155
01:33:33,591 --> 01:33:35,810
And how d'you thank her, tonight?

1156
01:33:35,927 --> 01:33:38,601
Spit in my face and start a brawl!

1157
01:33:38,722 --> 01:33:39,814
Go fuck yourself bitch

1158
01:33:39,931 --> 01:33:42,184
with your lame-ass shitty lawyer job!

1159
01:33:42,308 --> 01:33:44,310
Come on! You just want
my mom to suck your cock...

1160
01:33:45,270 --> 01:33:47,147
Motherfucker!

1161
01:33:52,861 --> 01:33:55,364
Choke on your fucking loser problems.

1162
01:33:55,488 --> 01:33:58,037
Yeah, get the fuck outta here!

1163
01:34:00,618 --> 01:34:02,666
Fuck off!

1164
01:34:10,545 --> 01:34:11,637
<i>That gm!"-</i>

1165
01:34:13,173 --> 01:34:16,894
was gonna help us, you idiot.

1166
01:34:17,427 --> 01:34:18,929
Help you.

1167
01:34:19,054 --> 01:34:21,273
No one can help us.
They're all the same!

1168
01:34:21,389 --> 01:34:24,393
It's just the two of us,
fuck the rest of 'em!

1169
01:34:24,517 --> 01:34:26,861
I don't have any problems, alright?

1170
01:34:26,978 --> 01:34:29,982
You know what my big problem is? You.

1171
01:34:30,106 --> 01:34:33,531
No more job because of you.
No money! No life!

1172
01:34:33,651 --> 01:34:35,870
Meds, bail, correctional centres,

1173
01:34:35,987 --> 01:34:37,284
and now a lawsuit!

1174
01:34:37,405 --> 01:34:40,705
Will someone gimme a fucking break?

1175
01:34:40,825 --> 01:34:44,170
No! Steve-O, ladies and gentlemen!

1176
01:34:44,287 --> 01:34:45,914
A break? What the fuck for!

1177
01:34:46,039 --> 01:34:48,212
Dream on, Die, dream on!

1178
01:34:48,833 --> 01:34:50,710
Daddy dug the grave,
sonny keeps digging!

1179
01:34:50,835 --> 01:34:54,510
And I'm singing in the rain!
And it just goes on and on and on,

1180
01:34:54,631 --> 01:34:57,475
'cause ya always find
a fucking brilliant way

1181
01:34:57,592 --> 01:35:00,516
so it hits the fan full effin blast!

1182
01:35:00,637 --> 01:35:02,810
And I just keep cleaning
the shit off the walls!

1183
01:35:02,931 --> 01:35:07,812
Come on, wipe the retard's ass!
Just wipe that effin retard's ass!

1184
01:35:20,782 --> 01:35:21,999
Now...

1185
01:37:08,848 --> 01:37:10,145
What can I do for you?

1186
01:37:11,184 --> 01:37:12,652
Where were you?

1187
01:37:16,564 --> 01:37:17,564
When?

1188
01:37:19,400 --> 01:37:20,868
When d'ya think?

1189
01:37:22,820 --> 01:37:24,242
I was sleeping.

1190
01:37:58,606 --> 01:38:00,074
Maybe, one day...

1191
01:38:03,403 --> 01:38:05,030
you won't love me anymore.

1192
01:38:07,448 --> 01:38:08,870
It's true.

1193
01:38:09,784 --> 01:38:10,831
It happens.

1194
01:38:15,456 --> 01:38:16,457
Me...

1195
01:38:17,750 --> 01:38:19,548
I'll always be there for you.

1196
01:38:21,129 --> 01:38:22,426
You...

1197
01:38:23,506 --> 01:38:24,758
You're my priority.

1198
01:39:01,836 --> 01:39:04,134
Aisle 2, aisle 3...
Jesus Christ!

1199
01:39:04,255 --> 01:39:06,098
Is it too much
to put fucking signs up!

1200
01:39:06,716 --> 01:39:09,094
Calm down, we'll find it.

1201
01:39:09,594 --> 01:39:14,020
He's on a high. Some bad phase.
That ain't in the budget right now.

1202
01:39:14,891 --> 01:39:16,234
- What?
- Don't touch anything!

1203
01:39:16,768 --> 01:39:18,270
All phases have an end,

1204
01:39:18,853 --> 01:39:20,070
he'll mellow out soon...

1205
01:39:20,188 --> 01:39:23,032
Here, take half my list

1206
01:39:23,149 --> 01:39:24,901
so we can get outta here.

1207
01:39:25,026 --> 01:39:26,026
I'm going that way.

1208
01:39:26,652 --> 01:39:27,744
Don't touch anything!

1209
01:39:28,196 --> 01:39:30,699
I don't know your morn
like you do, but...

1210
01:39:31,157 --> 01:39:33,159
I know what being a mom's like.

1211
01:39:34,077 --> 01:39:36,375
She doesn't mean any harm.

1212
01:39:36,496 --> 01:39:38,590
It's her fear talking.

1213
01:39:39,123 --> 01:39:40,375
Fear drives people.

1214
01:39:40,792 --> 01:39:43,170
I don't give a shit if she don't
want me anymore.

1215
01:39:43,544 --> 01:39:46,798
Doesn't. She does want you with her.
Come on, please.

1216
01:39:47,965 --> 01:39:49,512
You have to refocus.

1217
01:39:50,635 --> 01:39:53,855
We'll focus on grades 10 and 11,
and then...

1218
01:39:54,472 --> 01:39:55,644
when the time comes...

1219
01:39:56,891 --> 01:39:59,144
we'll apply to Juilliard.

1220
01:39:59,769 --> 01:40:03,444
One day we'll get a nice letter

1221
01:40:03,564 --> 01:40:04,986
in a nice envelope,

1222
01:40:05,108 --> 01:40:07,110
and your mom will be so proud.

1223
01:41:17,597 --> 01:41:18,597
You can do it.

1224
01:41:25,354 --> 01:41:27,573
Just say the fucking words.

1225
01:41:33,237 --> 01:41:34,237
What?

1226
01:41:39,785 --> 01:41:41,583
The hell d'you do?

1227
01:41:48,377 --> 01:41:49,424
Come on...

1228
01:41:55,760 --> 01:41:58,309
We still love each other, right?

1229
01:41:58,888 --> 01:42:02,438
That's what we best at, buddy!
Let's go, c'mere!

1230
01:42:02,975 --> 01:42:04,818
Grab the feet, Kyla.

1231
01:45:07,201 --> 01:45:08,418
Are you coming home late?

1232
01:45:11,247 --> 01:45:15,423
Are you cooking
or should I order?

1233
01:45:23,175 --> 01:45:25,394
I'll be home for dinner
but order, yeah.

1234
01:45:25,928 --> 01:45:27,726
I won't be in the mood.

1235
01:45:28,514 --> 01:45:32,519
The box below contains 4 balls...

1236
01:45:34,478 --> 01:45:36,947
Numbered from 1 to 4.

1237
01:45:37,064 --> 01:45:42,662
Successively draw two balls
from the box without replacement.

1238
01:45:43,237 --> 01:45:44,489
Balls...

1239
01:45:46,449 --> 01:45:49,919
You don't return
the first ball in the box

1240
01:45:50,035 --> 01:45:51,958
before drawing the second one.

1241
01:45:52,413 --> 01:45:53,413
Balls...

1242
01:45:56,459 --> 01:45:57,881
Go on.

1243
01:45:58,335 --> 01:45:59,335
The result...

1244
01:46:00,004 --> 01:46:01,722
What's that sexy white car
doing in my driveway?

1245
01:46:14,059 --> 01:46:15,276
D'you like it?

1246
01:46:16,437 --> 01:46:17,814
Where to, miss?

1247
01:46:17,938 --> 01:46:20,532
It's got an ass-heater.

1248
01:46:20,941 --> 01:46:22,113
See the button?

1249
01:46:42,797 --> 01:46:45,846
A mother doesn't wake up one morning
not loving her son.

1250
01:46:46,717 --> 01:46:48,014
Do you get that?

1251
01:46:51,222 --> 01:46:52,314
Yeah, whatev...

1252
01:46:55,851 --> 01:46:57,819
The only thing that's gonna happen...

1253
01:46:59,146 --> 01:47:01,490
is I'll love you more and more.

1254
01:47:04,235 --> 01:47:06,909
And you'll be the one loving me
less and less, but...

1255
01:47:11,534 --> 01:47:13,207
Life works that way.

1256
01:47:14,578 --> 01:47:16,171
We deal with it.

1257
01:47:16,914 --> 01:47:20,589
It's the natural order of things,
you'll get that one day, bud.

1258
01:47:22,336 --> 01:47:24,179
You know what I'm saying?

1259
01:47:24,296 --> 01:47:25,764
D'you understand?

1260
01:47:36,433 --> 01:47:38,481
D'ya pack your bags like I asked?

1261
01:47:44,024 --> 01:47:45,992
D'you pack your shit or what?

1262
01:47:51,282 --> 01:47:52,408
Don't tickle me!

1263
01:47:56,745 --> 01:47:58,418
Don't forget the sandwiches!

1264
01:47:59,582 --> 01:48:01,129
Look what I found in the fridge!

1265
01:48:01,876 --> 01:48:02,876
Look!

1266
01:48:03,502 --> 01:48:05,345
How the fuck is that my problem?

1267
01:48:06,714 --> 01:48:08,307
Back door locked, eh?

1268
01:48:15,681 --> 01:48:17,683
It's gonna be an effin trip!

1269
01:48:17,808 --> 01:48:19,606
Do you want this with you, Die?

1270
01:48:19,727 --> 01:48:21,024
Yeah, not in the trunk.

1271
01:48:27,067 --> 01:48:28,614
We got everything?

1272
01:48:28,944 --> 01:48:30,491
Didn't forget anything?

1273
01:53:26,867 --> 01:53:27,868
It's green.

1274
01:53:29,203 --> 01:53:30,203
You Okay?

1275
01:53:47,012 --> 01:53:48,639
I gotta use the washroom.

1276
01:53:56,605 --> 01:53:57,822
Let's try this place.

1277
01:55:17,811 --> 01:55:19,813
Mom's pissing?

1278
01:55:42,794 --> 01:55:44,387
Am I squishing you?

1279
01:56:58,870 --> 01:57:00,964
You motherfucking bitch from hell!

1280
01:57:01,748 --> 01:57:03,500
Take it easy! Take it easy!

1281
01:57:03,875 --> 01:57:05,468
Back off, asshole!

1282
01:57:06,128 --> 01:57:08,631
- Don't touch me, don't talk to me!
- Chill out, bro!

1283
01:57:20,809 --> 01:57:22,777
- Easy, easy, easy...
- Relax, we're here to help.

1284
01:57:24,521 --> 01:57:26,649
Why you doing this to me,
you bitch!

1285
01:57:26,773 --> 01:57:29,617
It's for you own good, sweetie!

1286
01:57:30,193 --> 01:57:32,161
My own good, you fucking traitor!

1287
01:57:32,988 --> 01:57:35,332
You dump me here like goddamn trash!

1288
01:57:35,449 --> 01:57:37,747
You got sick of me!
You're done with me!

1289
01:57:43,999 --> 01:57:46,172
Don't be violent, Steve.
There's no point.

1290
01:57:46,293 --> 01:57:48,842
Shut up!
You gonna taze my ass, bitch!

1291
01:57:48,962 --> 01:57:51,260
You want 'em
to fucking electrocute me!

1292
01:57:56,636 --> 01:58:00,015
I won't touch you if you come
in the hospital without resisting.

1293
01:58:00,724 --> 01:58:02,351
No! I ain't mad!

1294
01:58:02,476 --> 01:58:04,604
I ain't goin in a hospital!
Do I look fucking crazy?

1295
01:58:04,728 --> 01:58:05,980
No one here's crazy, pal.

1296
01:58:06,313 --> 01:58:09,817
Stop it! No! I won't go! Mom!

1297
01:58:10,567 --> 01:58:12,444
I don't wanna go! I won't!

1298
01:58:13,904 --> 01:58:16,578
Don't leave me here!
Don't do this to me!

1299
01:58:18,617 --> 01:58:19,617
Mom!

1300
01:58:22,871 --> 01:58:25,920
And you, you fucking wimp!
You too?

1301
01:58:26,291 --> 01:58:28,760
You bitches are all against me!
All of you!

1302
01:58:28,877 --> 01:58:30,299
I said back the fuck off!

1303
01:58:32,088 --> 01:58:33,590
Is that fucking necessary!

1304
01:58:33,715 --> 01:58:36,093
Let us do our job!

1305
01:58:36,218 --> 01:58:38,437
- Drop that!
- You gonna fucking hurt me!

1306
01:58:39,387 --> 01:58:40,730
Calm the fuck down, man!

1307
01:58:40,847 --> 01:58:41,847
Calm down!

1308
01:58:43,517 --> 01:58:44,517
Let me fucking go!

1309
01:58:44,559 --> 01:58:45,560
Let him go!

1310
01:58:47,062 --> 01:58:48,359
Son of a bitch!

1311
01:58:50,982 --> 01:58:52,108
Let go of him!

1312
01:58:53,109 --> 01:58:54,235
Son of a bitch!

1313
01:58:54,361 --> 01:58:55,829
I'm just doing my job, ma'am!

1314
01:58:55,946 --> 01:58:58,449
He hit my son!

1315
01:58:58,782 --> 01:59:01,831
He hit him! He hit him!

1316
01:59:01,952 --> 01:59:04,080
You signed the form!

1317
01:59:04,204 --> 01:59:05,877
Let us do our job!
That's enough, ma'am!

1318
01:59:05,997 --> 01:59:08,250
I didn't sign for you
to hit my son!

1319
01:59:08,375 --> 01:59:09,968
Withdrawal clause ends
in 24 hours!

1320
01:59:10,085 --> 01:59:11,587
Fuck your clause!

1321
01:59:11,920 --> 01:59:14,924
- Come back in 24 hours, ma'am!
- Mom, he's hurting me!

1322
01:59:15,257 --> 01:59:17,510
I'm his mother, I decide!

1323
01:59:17,634 --> 01:59:18,634
Not anymore!

1324
01:59:22,305 --> 01:59:25,104
What are they doing to him?
I changed my mind!

1325
01:59:25,225 --> 01:59:26,818
Get out of the fucking way!

1326
01:59:27,811 --> 01:59:28,811
Son of a bitch!

1327
02:01:39,401 --> 02:01:41,449
There goes the forest...

1328
02:01:42,612 --> 02:01:44,865
Forest again...

1329
02:01:47,200 --> 02:01:49,248
And, now the beach, okay...

1330
02:02:24,988 --> 02:02:27,582
<i>Hi, you've reached Diane's voice-mail.</i>

1331
02:02:27,699 --> 02:02:28,700
<i>Leave a message</i>

1332
02:02:29,576 --> 02:02:30,998
<i>and I'll call you back
as soon as possible.</i>

1333
02:02:31,536 --> 02:02:32,958
<i>Thank you, bye, have a nice day.</i>

1334
02:02:34,247 --> 02:02:35,874
Hey, it's me.

1335
02:02:36,541 --> 02:02:39,294
I bet you must be
cleaning up your houses...

1336
02:02:40,503 --> 02:02:42,722
I'm pretty bad-ass high...

1337
02:02:44,090 --> 02:02:46,184
I was calling to say...

1338
02:02:50,847 --> 02:02:53,020
Yo Die,
I'm so fucking ripped, serious...

1339
02:02:54,684 --> 02:02:56,527
If you could see my face...

1340
02:02:56,936 --> 02:02:59,314
You'd laugh your ass off!

1341
02:03:01,858 --> 02:03:03,906
I thought you were gonna answer.

1342
02:03:04,486 --> 02:03:05,988
I wanted to tell you...

1343
02:03:10,283 --> 02:03:12,251
I just wanted to...

1344
02:03:12,368 --> 02:03:14,746
thank you for your patience.

1345
02:03:15,997 --> 02:03:18,967
I know I'm rough.

1346
02:03:19,083 --> 02:03:21,256
Like Grandma used to say
when I was younger,

1347
02:03:21,377 --> 02:03:22,503
that I was rough.

1348
02:03:23,171 --> 02:03:25,549
Now I get it, why she said that.

1349
02:03:26,758 --> 02:03:28,351
So... I'm sorry.

1350
02:03:29,969 --> 02:03:31,186
And...

1351
02:03:35,892 --> 02:03:36,939
And when...

1352
02:03:37,894 --> 02:03:40,067
When I think about the times when...

1353
02:03:42,524 --> 02:03:45,573
When I think about
how much maybe I hurt you...

1354
02:03:47,320 --> 02:03:50,824
After, when I get my shit together...

1355
02:03:53,701 --> 02:03:55,669
I'm so fucking sad because...

1356
02:03:55,787 --> 02:03:58,540
you deserve so much better
than a fucking retard like me!

1357
02:04:03,711 --> 02:04:04,758
So...

1358
02:04:09,133 --> 02:04:13,513
What matters is... I'm thinking
about you here, and I love you.

1359
02:04:17,684 --> 02:04:21,234
Tell Kyla I said hi.

1360
02:04:28,945 --> 02:04:30,788
Was it okay?

1361
02:04:35,159 --> 02:04:37,002
I mean, was it...

1362
02:04:37,829 --> 02:04:39,581
I was okay? 'lght.

1363
02:04:46,337 --> 02:04:47,680
I rang.

1364
02:04:48,423 --> 02:04:50,596
I didn't hear ya,
it must be broken.

1365
02:04:54,178 --> 02:04:57,557
I'm cleaning up that shed,
it's a freakin' pigsty.

1366
02:05:00,351 --> 02:05:01,728
Are you okay?

1367
02:05:02,061 --> 02:05:03,654
Of course!

1368
02:05:03,771 --> 02:05:06,240
You?
Long time no see, stranger!

1369
02:05:07,275 --> 02:05:09,824
You wanna come in, have a beer?

1370
02:05:09,944 --> 02:05:12,914
Watch some TV,
I finally plugged it in.

1371
02:05:13,031 --> 02:05:14,499
It's just about time I did.

1372
02:05:16,200 --> 02:05:17,200
Have a beer!

1373
02:05:17,911 --> 02:05:21,381
We can have dinner too,
I'll fix some pasta...

1374
02:05:22,373 --> 02:05:23,420
Come on!

1375
02:05:24,584 --> 02:05:25,676
There!

1376
02:05:27,837 --> 02:05:29,089
My good glasses...

1377
02:05:43,394 --> 02:05:47,444
I came to tell you
we're moving to Toronto.

1378
02:05:48,107 --> 02:05:49,529
For Patrick's job.

1379
02:05:55,239 --> 02:05:56,786
Get outta here!

1380
02:05:57,533 --> 02:06:00,161
Well, that ain't dull news, Toronto!

1381
02:06:00,912 --> 02:06:02,164
Jeez, I only got beer!

1382
02:06:02,830 --> 02:06:05,834
Had I known, I would have gotten
something more fancy! To party!

1383
02:06:06,626 --> 02:06:08,378
I'll be damned!

1384
02:06:09,212 --> 02:06:11,340
I lived in Toronto, once!

1385
02:06:11,798 --> 02:06:13,596
Ages ago, though, but...

1386
02:06:14,801 --> 02:06:17,224
Just before Steve, actually.

1387
02:06:17,345 --> 02:06:21,395
I'd written down tons of addresses
and places and...

1388
02:06:21,516 --> 02:06:25,737
in that huge, huge address book
I could give you...

1389
02:06:26,521 --> 02:06:28,364
'Cause you can't tell right away,

1390
02:06:29,524 --> 02:06:32,698
but Toronto can be an effin bore
if you dunno your way around.

1391
02:06:33,361 --> 02:06:34,908
All of these places
I spotted, jeez...

1392
02:06:35,238 --> 02:06:39,288
Restaurants, some good ones,
and cute shops, not tourist-traps.

1393
02:06:40,159 --> 02:06:42,753
There's no way I threw that away!
Where the hell is it...

1394
02:06:43,663 --> 02:06:45,210
When are you guys leaving?

1395
02:06:45,748 --> 02:06:48,251
Well, two months from now,
originally,

1396
02:06:50,086 --> 02:06:51,554
but then...

1397
02:06:53,006 --> 02:06:57,056
they moved it
to two week-ends from now.

1398
02:06:59,053 --> 02:07:02,224
But now... finally...

1399
02:07:04,475 --> 02:07:07,228
we're leaving next weekend.

1400
02:07:07,353 --> 02:07:08,980
Shit on a brick!

1401
02:07:09,564 --> 02:07:10,816
Next weekend?!

1402
02:07:11,441 --> 02:07:13,193
WOW!

1403
02:07:17,280 --> 02:07:20,659
Talk about a big project!
Well, that's quite the adventure!

1404
02:07:20,783 --> 02:07:23,753
You're moving to Toronto
next weekend!

1405
02:07:25,121 --> 02:07:26,964
You must be over the effin moon!

1406
02:07:33,129 --> 02:07:35,598
I didn't think you'd react that way.

1407
02:07:38,926 --> 02:07:41,770
What the hell did ya expect!
It's such great news!

1408
02:07:43,389 --> 02:07:46,313
It's awesome!
It's freaking awesome!

1409
02:07:46,434 --> 02:07:47,560
You best write me, girl!

1410
02:07:48,936 --> 02:07:51,985
If you don't, I'll visit you,
I swear I will, want it or not!

1411
02:07:55,151 --> 02:07:57,449
I gotta go back to my boxes...

1412
02:07:57,987 --> 02:08:00,240
Stay, grab a beer!

1413
02:08:00,364 --> 02:08:02,366
Let's have dinner to celebrate!

1414
02:08:02,492 --> 02:08:05,336
By the way,
bugs are eating up my apples,

1415
02:08:05,453 --> 02:08:08,627
I gotta do something with them.
I could bake a pie.

1416
02:08:08,748 --> 02:08:12,548
We'll have some pie. I got some
nice ice cream to put on top!

1417
02:08:14,962 --> 02:08:17,385
I could come back later!

1418
02:08:17,507 --> 02:08:19,851
Come with Patrick!

1419
02:08:19,967 --> 02:08:20,967
And your daughter!

1420
02:08:21,594 --> 02:08:22,594
They never came over!

1421
02:08:37,235 --> 02:08:38,953
I don't want you to think

1422
02:08:39,070 --> 02:08:42,119
these past few months
didn't mean anything to me,

1423
02:08:43,032 --> 02:08:44,409
with you...

1424
02:08:45,576 --> 02:08:46,793
Me too.

1425
02:08:47,411 --> 02:08:49,755
They were important for me too!

1426
02:08:49,872 --> 02:08:51,044
We had fun!

1427
02:08:51,874 --> 02:08:54,423
A shitload of fun!

1428
02:08:55,378 --> 02:08:58,097
You did us good, we loved having ya!

1429
02:08:58,673 --> 02:08:59,890
In my life...

1430
02:09:00,466 --> 02:09:02,389
You more of a pie girl
or crisp girl?

1431
02:09:20,570 --> 02:09:22,698
I can't just abandon...

1432
02:09:27,034 --> 02:09:28,286
...abandon my family...

1433
02:09:41,632 --> 02:09:43,305
That's not what I meant.

1434
02:10:00,276 --> 02:10:01,448
You know, Kyla...

1435
02:10:04,864 --> 02:10:06,537
There's just so many ways to deal.

1436
02:10:08,242 --> 02:10:10,916
You deal with your life,
I deal with mine. That's it.

1437
02:10:17,877 --> 02:10:19,424
I sent him there...

1438
02:10:23,507 --> 02:10:25,009
because I have hope.

1439
02:10:26,969 --> 02:10:29,188
I'm full of hope, okay?

1440
02:10:35,519 --> 02:10:37,647
This world ain't got tons of hope.

1441
02:10:39,273 --> 02:10:40,820
But I like to think...

1442
02:10:42,985 --> 02:10:46,615
that it's full of hopeful people,
hoping all day long.

1443
02:10:50,117 --> 02:10:53,417
Better off that way 'cause us
hopeful people can change things.

1444
02:10:54,413 --> 02:10:56,507
Hopeful world with hopeless people...

1445
02:10:56,624 --> 02:10:58,877
That won't get us far.

1446
02:11:01,212 --> 02:11:02,634
I did what I did...

1447
02:11:07,343 --> 02:11:09,596
so that way, there is hope.

1448
02:11:17,561 --> 02:11:18,778
So I win.

1449
02:11:22,483 --> 02:11:23,735
All the way.

1450
02:11:26,070 --> 02:11:29,415
It's a win-win.
For everybody.

1451
02:11:33,953 --> 02:11:35,125
So...

1452
02:11:35,997 --> 02:11:38,466
pie or crisp?

1453
02:13:23,145 --> 02:13:26,365
Dr. Fawcett will pass by later,
for his meds' eval.

1454
02:13:26,690 --> 02:13:28,613
Hopefully, we can relocate him...

1455
02:13:28,734 --> 02:13:30,486
Nah, Micheline's off tonight.

1456
02:13:31,153 --> 02:13:33,247
She left for St-Paul's
but she's back tonight.

1457
02:13:33,364 --> 02:13:35,617
- It's her Thursday.
- She's done with Thursdays.

1458
02:13:36,033 --> 02:13:38,502
Not anymore.
Don't ask.

1459
02:13:39,495 --> 02:13:40,997
Don't try to understand, bro.

1460
02:13:42,415 --> 02:13:43,883
What can you do?

1461
02:13:44,542 --> 02:13:45,668
She's happy with him.

1462
02:13:46,460 --> 02:13:49,430
He started drinking again...
She's back with him, what can I say?

1463
02:13:49,547 --> 02:13:51,675
Is she dumb,
she'll never understand?

1464
02:13:51,799 --> 02:13:53,142
There's nothing to understand.

1465
02:13:53,259 --> 02:13:55,011
She wants to save him.

1466
02:13:55,636 --> 02:13:57,013
Fucking human nature, bro.
