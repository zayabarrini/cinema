1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:04,750
The only truth
is love beyond reason.

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:10,790
We write about 20, 25 texts a day.

4
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:16,000
I'd go, C'mon, let's hitchhike
to Miami Beach.

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:17,630
He'd answer now!

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,050
In 1 sec he's there.

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,410
But of course

8
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,710
I fall for that fucking
arrogant prick Jean-Marc

9
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,340
who takes forever
to answer my emails.

10
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:28,590
I'm such a dumbass.

11
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:32,330
Sometimes

12
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm at my computer…

13
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:36,840
and I panic.

14
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:38,700
I get all worked up.

15
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:40,550
I go,

16
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:44,250
If somebody died
every time I hit Refresh,

17
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,550
there'd be nobody left alive, fuck.

18
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,450
When you go into a bar,
go for groceries,

19
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:53,090
walk down the street, eat out…

20
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,380
Whose ass do you check out?

21
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:59,080
When you're on the prowl,
is it tits or cocks?

22
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:01,880
Tits, cocks? Cocks, tits?

23
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:03,840
It was my pussy.

24
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,370
Marilyn. The cat was gone.

25
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:11,080
I knew right away because
I didn't hear the tingaling.

26
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:14,130
He'd put this collar on her…

27
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:18,510
You know, for midgets…
for Santa's elves. A tiny bell.

28
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:21,160
He put a bell on,
thought it was cute.

29
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:22,620
You always heard it.

30
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,000
But I came home, she wasn't there.

31
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,880
I went, Marilyn?

32
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,210
No bell.

33
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,500
And the vase…

34
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,380
in terracotta,
that was filled with

35
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,170
pennies and shit, on the buffet.

36
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,920
Gone.

37
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:48,670
So I turn around
and next to the door,

38
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,380
just my boots.

39
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:55,300
No running shoes.
No guy stuff at all.

40
00:01:55,970 --> 00:02:00,290
So naturally I tear through
the place at like 250 mph.

41
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,970
He'd taken everything.

42
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,840
All… all… all his shit.

43
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:11,040
On the kitchen table
there was a sheet of blue notepaper

44
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,210
with, written in German
— cause he was German…

45
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,970
Must still be.

46
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:19,420
"I don't want to waste my life
loving you badly."

47
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,290
You can't be 50-50.

48
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,630
Straight is straight, gay is gay.

49
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,420
And don't bring up
your "mood" crap.

50
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,460
The Humidex
doesn't affect your libido.

51
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,340
Or the moon in Aquarius.

52
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:32,750
Gimme a fucking break!

53
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:34,160
I know everything.

54
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:36,290
Everything.

55
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,760
I know where he works,

56
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,670
the restaurants he eats in.

57
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,130
I walked by his building.

58
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:45,370
Ran into the janitor.

59
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:49,210
So I asked him,
dunno the fuck why,

60
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,210
if he was home.

61
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:54,130
Janitor starts talking about him.

62
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,880
I listen.

63
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,210
I start talking about him,
the little I knew.

64
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,000
As if I knew him
since kindergarten.

65
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:05,250
One point I realize I'm fucked.

66
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:09,130
So I tell him to say
Cindy Rosenberg says hello.

67
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,290
Not to look like a stalker.

68
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,010
If he had any idea…

69
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,210
I am so well informed.

70
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,630
His dad had a stroke in 2002.

71
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,550
His Mom owns a multicolored
wooden flowers stand

72
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,090
at Jocelyne's Treasures…

73
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,710
If he knew,

74
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,050
he'd probably enter
the witness protection program

75
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:30,210
for Mafia stools.

76
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:34,300
Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction.

77
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,170
That's me.

78
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:06,510
Who is that self-satisfied Adonis?

79
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:09,500
The blond?

80
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:13,790
Nicolas.

81
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,630
Country lad. Friend of Sophie's.

82
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,290
Just moved into town.

83
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:09,080
HEARTBEATS

84
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:22,840
- Hello.
- Marie?

85
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:25,790
Guess who we're meeting Saturday?

86
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,790
Seismography.

87
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:16,080
You bore cables and sensors
into the ground.

88
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,710
You blow it all up
and you can make maps.

89
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:21,670
Based on the vibrations

90
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,750
you can see what's underground.

91
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,050
Oil companies pay
$200 mill for 'em.

92
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,300
It's crazy.

93
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:32,370
We work 92-hour weeks
and with overtime

94
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,040
you take home $1300 a week,
plus a fat tax refund,

95
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:39,800
cause I'm studying literature
at McGill.

96
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,580
I only do it for the money

97
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:46,500
and to forget all the shit.

98
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:49,540
At night I read
to exercise my brain.

99
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:52,420
Koltès keeps you in shape.

100
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,080
- Well?
- Well, what?

101
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:03,170
What do you think of Nicolas?

102
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,870
He's nice.

103
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,160
Yeah, he's nice.

104
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:13,210
He's intelligent.

105
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:18,830
Personally he's not my type.

106
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:25,790
Me neither.

107
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,170
Thursday night we enter
a rowdy bar with flashy lights

108
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,330
and order ales and lemonade.

109
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:38,500
- Hello?
- Hi, how are you?

110
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,250
I'm good, you?

111
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,500
Good.

112
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,870
Guess what?

113
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,880
I dunno.

114
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:48,210
But Nico sent me a card.

115
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,340
You got one too?

116
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,840
Yeah, I got it this morning.

117
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:56,340
So, see you Thursday, then?

118
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,200
It'll be fun.

119
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,330
Eating your cherry, Terry?

120
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,010
Cherries are too sweet.

121
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,910
Fudge is 17 times sweeter
than cherries.

122
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:01,050
Ever play hide-and-seek?

123
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,670
Yeah.

124
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,250
Wanna play?

125
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:07,710
Like, on the mountain, maybe?

126
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:08,790
Sure, but,

127
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,380
do you need to change?

128
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,080
Are you gonna wear that dress,
or…?

129
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,710
Cause you…

130
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:25,540
Sporty.

131
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,160
One bottle of wine.

132
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:34,040
Two bottles of wine.
Three bottles of wine…

133
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:23,290
Bunny!

134
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,620
Bunny!

135
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:54,410
You must've sucked at this game
as a kid.

136
00:13:58,590 --> 00:13:59,500
There was…

137
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:02,000
I saw a white rabbit.

138
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,500
A pet rabbit that probably escaped.

139
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,420
Marie!

140
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,120
Marie!

141
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:53,000
His dad knows a stage designer.
Nick asked me to his play.

142
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:56,300
Cool.

143
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,290
OK.

144
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,540
You have a big bed, right?

145
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,920
Yeah, I have a big bed.

146
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:36,340
You can sleep here. We'll just…

147
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,330
We'll just squeeze in.

148
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:41,290
Thanks, man.

149
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:42,670
Shotgun the side.

150
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,120
I hate the middle too!

151
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,090
No sweat, I like the middle.

152
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,420
Good.

153
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,080
Sleeping tight, Marie?

154
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:49,170
Not eating, Marie?

155
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,840
I'm not hungry.

156
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,420
An article on the play
I invited you to.

157
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,960
Francis, want me to try
to get you a ticket?

158
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,590
- It's on Thursday?
- Yeah.

159
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:10,960
No… I'm busy Thursday.

160
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,630
Too bad.

161
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:17,170
The play's surrealistic, but it's
based on an Audrey Hepburn movie.

162
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:19,050
The love of my life.

163
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,250
Thanks. With one sugar.

164
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:19,620
Here you go. That's $2.25 please.

165
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:20,510
Thanks.

166
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:22,080
Keep the change. Bye.

167
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:34,800
Hey!

168
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,840
Hey, how's it going?

169
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:37,670
Fine, you?

170
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,510
Yeah. What are you doing here?

171
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,920
- I live on Jeanne-Mance.
- Really?

172
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:43,840
What's up?

173
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:47,620
I was grabbing a coffee
with a friend. She just left.

174
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,630
Funny, cause I just… Dammit!

175
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,590
I'll just… Fuck, my coffee!

176
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:56,290
Wait, lemme show you.
Shit, I spilled it all over.

177
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,260
Did I get you? Here you go…

178
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:01,420
Lucky! Where'd you find it?

179
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:03,500
It's for you.

180
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:06,630
I bought it for you.

181
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,080
Really, Frank…

182
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:09,500
You're so sweet!

183
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:11,500
- My pleasure.
- Thank you!

184
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:14,000
You said you liked her
so I thought…

185
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,630
I gotta run.
I'm cooking for a girlfriend.

186
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,840
No worries.

187
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:22,090
A girlfriend?

188
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,290
Pesto with pine nuts.

189
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:26,750
There you go.

190
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:30,590
But thanks a lot.
I can't wait to…

191
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,380
to put it up.

192
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:37,340
I'm off.

193
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,590
- I'll call you.
- OK.

194
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,040
- See you!
- Bye.

195
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,710
Don't forget your bags!

196
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,330
Your pesto won't…
without the bags.

197
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,290
- Bye!
- Call me!

198
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:48,880
- Yeah!
- OK!

199
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,910
Was it bad?

200
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,300
No, no.

201
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:15,580
It was very…

202
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:17,460
engrossing.

203
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,790
You have amazing eyes.

204
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:24,660
Hazel?

205
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,540
As banal an iris as they come.

206
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,460
A high IQ is a vital counterpoint
to brown eyes.

207
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:39,630
Do you ever think of movie stars
when you fuck?

208
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,260
No, I don't think of anything.

209
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,710
Do you picture celebrities
during coitus?

210
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,210
Yeah.

211
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,330
But I don't need to with you.

212
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:08,460
Are you in love right now?

213
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,970
Pains, Migraines and Sonatas

214
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,660
Pretty so-so, huh?

215
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:26,380
The dialogue was a mess.

216
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,590
So pompous.

217
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:33,620
I heard the author on the radio.

218
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:36,670
She called it the work
she least understood.

219
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,460
These pseudo borderlines…

220
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:44,760
with their pain fetish as an escape
from existential ennui…

221
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:46,000
Fuck off!

222
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,750
They just need to get laid.

223
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:54,040
The authors have struck again.

224
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:57,660
I was irrevocably scarred by
Wild Berries and Sodomy.

225
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:01,590
The characters were so Manichean.

226
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:03,500
Manichean?

227
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:06,130
Manichean.

228
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,300
You know, good versus evil.

229
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:12,870
All black or all white.

230
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:15,040
Yeah, I know what it means.

231
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:19,210
I just found it charming
you'd use the word Manichean.

232
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,920
Seems out of character?

233
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:26,040
No, not at all. On the contrary.

234
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:37,540
There's a little

235
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,540
Vietnamese place near where I live.

236
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,580
It might be

237
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:44,620
pleasant.

238
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,590
Yeah, totally.

239
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:58,510
Marie, it's Frankie!

240
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:02,460
Frankie!

241
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:04,620
- What's up?
- We just saw the play.

242
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:07,540
Shit, I forgot! It was tonight.

243
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,800
Antony, this is Nico.
Nico, Antony…

244
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,080
Nicolas, this is Jody.

245
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,130
And Clara, Nicolas.

246
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,330
Hi.

247
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:22,760
Didn't hurt too much
when you fell from heaven?

248
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:30,470
How was the play?

249
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:32,040
Disappointing.

250
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:35,700
That's all? What a shame.

251
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,800
It wasn't good?

252
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:38,160
It was awful.

253
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:42,750
But those actors are good.

254
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,660
Well, they were awful.

255
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:49,670
Anyway, it's funny
you came here to eat.

256
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,050
It's measurable.

257
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:13,880
The Kinsey scale has 7 categories,
7 degrees.

258
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:17,090
0) Exclusively heterosexual.

259
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:21,420
1) Predominantly heterosexual,
incidentally homosexual.

260
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:26,330
2) Predominantly heterosexual,
more than incidentally homosexual,

261
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:28,670
- like Jean.
- Go fuck yourself!

262
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,160
3) Bisexual with no preference.

263
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,630
4) Predominantly homosexual,
incidentally heterosexual.

264
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:40,410
5) Predominantly homosexual,
more than incidentally heterosexual.

265
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:44,250
And 6) Exclusively homosexual.

266
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:46,670
Where do you fall on the scale?

267
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:50,660
The Golden Coconut Club.

268
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:54,040
No, Golden Coconut Depot.

269
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:58,630
Yeah. We shared
a little Californian wine.

270
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,260
And we split a

271
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:04,870
fried banana.

272
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:06,460
Then…

273
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,340
we went dutch, because…

274
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,210
well,

275
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,840
I wanted it to be clear.

276
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:16,670
Then I gave her a lift to the metro.

277
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,880
It must've been, what, 11:15?

278
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:23,660
And I went for a beer with friends.

279
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:29,460
Oh, and my ex was there.

280
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,210
The day he moved in,

281
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:34,910
it was over. It was over!

282
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:37,460
No, I mean, it wasn't over, over.

283
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:41,670
I mean, we still lived together
and had sex and all, but…

284
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,540
But those are details, meaningless.

285
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:46,500
It was over.

286
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:49,540
Of course at first

287
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:52,250
we didn't want to admit it

288
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:55,380
cause we felt bad, you know.

289
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,840
The move, all the cargo…

290
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:03,290
All that… all that stuff.

291
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:06,550
That's a shitload of money
out the window.

292
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:09,920
That said, mein Herr
is making Euros,

293
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:12,000
so he can go fuck himself.

294
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:13,880
It's like we were…

295
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,840
"We…" I mean,
I'll speak for myself.

296
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,370
Me…

297
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,290
For me…

298
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,630
I was infatuated
with the kind of love we had.

299
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:29,120
He lived in Berlin,

300
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:31,630
me, on Dorion St, so…

301
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:35,220
I guess I was in love with,

302
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,460
you know, taking the plane and

303
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:40,300
I dunno, landing, the cafés,

304
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:41,920
the cigarettes and…

305
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:44,460
wind from elsewhere,

306
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:46,920
his accent.

307
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:49,370
It doesn't exist.

308
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:52,130
It's the concept you love.

309
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:55,040
You love the concept more than him.

310
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,920
It's the distance you love.

311
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:01,630
But when there's no more distance…

312
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,870
When…

313
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:05,750
when there's no more ocean to cross

314
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,380
and all there's left to cross
is a hallway…

315
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:11,410
Anyway,

316
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,050
it's over now.

317
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:19,790
The letter I got two days after

318
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,420
our evening out.

319
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:29,210
"My dear Julien,

320
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:34,580
I can't stop thinking
about our enchanting tête-à-tête.

321
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:38,170
Your humor and gallantry seduced me.

322
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:42,590
Yesterday I went to
the Northland Mall with the girls.

323
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:45,040
I think I found your perfume.

324
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:51,540
Is it by chance Insurrection

325
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,870
from Colin Arpel, by chance?"

326
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,630
No, it's not.

327
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,090
"My top moment of our night?

328
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:09,460
Definitely when you kissed me
on the cheek at the metro station,

329
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:11,210
almost grazing my cheek.

330
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:15,000
I shut my eyes

331
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:18,920
and felt transported
to the Champs-Élysées."

332
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:21,920
C H A N S

333
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:26,500
É L I S É S.

334
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:28,870
He calls me Miss.

335
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:31,380
Uses "vous" with me.

336
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:35,630
Who are we,
fucking de Musset and Georges Sand?

337
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,380
Pussy-footing. I hate pussy-footing.

338
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:44,670
Now he's ruining
all my favorite places because

339
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:46,580
when he's not there,

340
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,210
having a beer with friends…

341
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:51,040
When he's not there,

342
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:52,910
I'm bored.

343
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:54,590
It's no fun.

344
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:59,540
Yet, the weather's nice, birds
are singing, the wine's good…

345
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,170
I mean: Shut up, bitch!

346
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:03,250
But it's no fun.

347
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:06,540
When he's there, watch out!

348
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:10,170
Like I popped 5 tabs of speed.
I say hi to everyone.

349
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,540
I act like
I'm straight off the farm.

350
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,710
St Donat. Howdy!

351
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,790
Worst, I hardly talk to him.

352
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:21,420
But I know he sees me.

353
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:24,540
You see people
even if you don't look.

354
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:27,630
Like, if you're there.

355
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,960
And I'm looking here.

356
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,250
I see you.

357
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,630
I'm not looking, but I see you.

358
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,500
I know

359
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:38,750
where you're looking. I know

360
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:41,080
you're looking at me.

361
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:43,210
Mother fucker.

362
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,250
OK.

363
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:53,630
You smell good.

364
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:55,540
Thanks.

365
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,710
Oh, God…

366
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:08,120
"Tick-tock goes your biological
clock, but where is Mister Right?

367
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,470
Modern fashionistas,

368
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:12,920
what kind of man makes you drool?

369
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:17,790
1) Describe the looks of the man
of your dreams."

370
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,040
What, now?

371
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:24,660
Yeah.

372
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,750
Brown hai… brown eyes.

373
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:39,550
For sure. Brown hair.

374
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,260
Down to here, about.

375
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,090
Short.

376
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:49,830
No, short… Well, curly.

377
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,870
Below the ears.
Almost shoulder-length.

378
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:55,960
Curly, blond.

379
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:03,920
And green eyes, maybe.

380
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,590
This is so beautiful.

381
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:47,090
"In love when I ask for a look,

382
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:50,870
what is deeply unsatisfying
and always futile,

383
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:53,010
is that you never look at me

384
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:54,550
from where I see you."

385
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,550
Smoke break. I'll wait outside.

386
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:52,550
My friends!

387
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:06,670
My friend!

388
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:15,160
Where do we put the gifts?

389
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:18,000
Shit, I am so wasted.

390
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:21,160
I've never been this drunk
in my life!

391
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:24,080
- What?
- Where do we put the gifts?

392
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:26,710
Oh yeah, right!

393
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:28,720
At the end of the hall,

394
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:32,290
the room to the right
of the dining room.

395
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:38,210
They bought me presents!
That's so cute!

396
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,790
Wow.

397
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:54,050
He's super drunk.

398
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:00,960
A boater.

399
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:04,050
- I bought him a boater.
- Yes!

400
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:05,670
Beautiful, huh?

401
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:07,750
I just hope

402
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:09,800
he doesn't vomit in it.

403
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,830
No, joking.

404
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:15,670
He'll be super happy. It's cool!

405
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:17,420
Yours? Yours?

406
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,040
It's… It's a little…

407
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:23,120
It's not as original.

408
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,380
Just some threads.

409
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:28,460
I wanna see!
You have such great taste!

410
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:36,750
Orange!

411
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,920
Tangerine.

412
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:39,710
It's tangerine.

413
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:42,500
Blond hair and citrus tones…

414
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:44,960
always a victorious partnership.

415
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:47,000
Well, I mean…

416
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:49,290
Maybe, I dunno…

417
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,460
I've heard that orange

418
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,340
is a safe pick for any skin tone.

419
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,870
Dunno about fluorescent orange,
though.

420
00:40:57,050 --> 00:40:58,920
That may be the exception.

421
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:01,960
It'll go with my boater.

422
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,710
You look great.

423
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,120
Thanks, that's sweet. You too.

424
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,250
Bling bling!

425
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:21,000
They're precious.

426
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,220
What a party!

427
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:18,370
"T'as de beaux yeux, tu sais !"

428
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:25,830
Know where that's from?

429
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:27,120
Yeah, sure.

430
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:30,500
So?

431
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:33,460
So what?

432
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:37,080
So what comes next?

433
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:39,840
I dunno.

434
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:36,130
"What a party!"

435
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:41,040
Idiot!

436
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:04,500
Who's that android?

437
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:06,920
His mother.

438
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:09,420
Her name is Désirée.

439
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:14,000
He introduced me to her.

440
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:16,710
She said
I looked like a 50s housewife.

441
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:19,590
Who is she anyway?
Captain Spock's wet-nurse?

442
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:22,830
Or perhaps a prostitute
from Blade Runner?

443
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,840
Your dress is a tad anachronistic.

444
00:44:27,010 --> 00:44:28,040
Sorry?

445
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:30,330
This is vintage, dearie!

446
00:44:32,050 --> 00:44:34,500
Not all vintage should come back.

447
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:28,760
Know what we should do?

448
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:29,920
No, what?

449
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:32,460
Go to my aunt's cottage
for the weekend.

450
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:35,670
She's in Europe.
I know where she hides the keys.

451
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:37,170
But I have to work.

452
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:39,300
Just call in sick.

453
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:41,590
Right.

454
00:47:42,590 --> 00:47:44,910
"Hi, this is Marie,
and I am sick."

455
00:47:45,090 --> 00:47:47,920
"Hi, this is Sick,
and I am Marie."

456
00:47:48,550 --> 00:47:50,010
OK, I'll call.

457
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:53,160
How are we gonna get there?

458
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:55,960
Saddle up a cat?

459
00:47:56,470 --> 00:47:58,460
- Magic carpet.
- No, by car.

460
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:01,840
I'll borrow JP's wheels.
He won't mind.

461
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:04,300
I better go now.

462
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:05,750
Who wants to come?

463
00:48:05,970 --> 00:48:08,750
But someone stays.
My mom's bringing some cash.

464
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:11,080
I need to buy cigarettes.

465
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:15,000
You'll see, Francis.

466
00:48:15,170 --> 00:48:16,750
My mom's cool.

467
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:20,220
Can you zip me up?

468
00:48:23,550 --> 00:48:24,500
You're good?

469
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:26,300
Thanks.

470
00:48:27,470 --> 00:48:29,040
- Shall we?
- Yeah, let's go.

471
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:32,090
- Later, Francis.
- Later.

472
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:03,710
Hello.

473
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:21,540
The party was a fuckin' blast.

474
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,300
Have you known Nick long?

475
00:50:24,050 --> 00:50:26,090
- About two months.
- Two months!

476
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,000
François, right?

477
00:50:28,170 --> 00:50:29,800
Francis, right!

478
00:50:31,470 --> 00:50:33,090
He's talked about you.

479
00:50:34,550 --> 00:50:36,510
It's true, you're a cutie!

480
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,960
Nice place, huh? A friggin' palace!

481
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:49,830
His dad pays for it.

482
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:53,250
That dick thinks
he's King of the World.

483
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:57,870
I love your…

484
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:02,420
What you're wearing, your top.

485
00:51:03,970 --> 00:51:05,670
This? Thanks, sweetie.

486
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:08,250
Got it in New York,
like, 10 years ago.

487
00:51:08,970 --> 00:51:10,960
I'm a dancer, I pack light.

488
00:51:11,130 --> 00:51:13,010
Don't travel much now, but…

489
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:15,000
Ask Nick.

490
00:51:15,170 --> 00:51:17,750
As a kid he loved being backstage.

491
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:21,160
His dad thought it was heavy.

492
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:23,630
Said it was vulgar. "It's vulgar!"

493
00:51:23,970 --> 00:51:26,830
What's a pair of tits to a toddler?
Fuck off.

494
00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:29,630
But ask Nick.

495
00:51:32,550 --> 00:51:34,710
I wonder if he still remembers.

496
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:38,870
The girls were crazy about him,
smothered him with kisses.

497
00:51:39,050 --> 00:51:40,710
He loved it. He was cute.

498
00:51:42,010 --> 00:51:43,170
Yeah.

499
00:51:43,470 --> 00:51:44,840
He must remember.

500
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:46,960
But we lost touch.

501
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:50,300
I mean, Miami,
Fort Lauderdale, Ixtapa…

502
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:52,660
Different time zones.

503
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:54,960
His dad snatched him back, pronto.

504
00:51:57,010 --> 00:51:58,670
Father knows best.

505
00:52:03,010 --> 00:52:04,250
Say that again.

506
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:05,960
He's gotta remember.

507
00:52:06,550 --> 00:52:07,790
The dressing rooms.

508
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:11,460
I brought him this, his allowance.

509
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,830
Grocery, lottery, candy, whatever.

510
00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:17,880
Show him. He's an airhead.

511
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:20,340
He'll toss it out.
Ciao sweet dough!

512
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:22,460
Not home?

513
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:26,330
I hoped to give him a smooch.
Where the fuck is he?

514
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:28,660
He'll be back. He's out with…

515
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:31,000
Marie.

516
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:33,880
You'll tell him, right?

517
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:36,460
Give him a kiss from me,
huh, twinkie?

518
00:52:36,670 --> 00:52:38,300
He'll be glad, I'm sure.

519
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:40,750
- Nice meeting you, Francis.
- Me, too.

520
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,120
You are a cutie.

521
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:47,920
- Bye.
- Have a nice day.

522
00:52:48,090 --> 00:52:51,210
Don't forget to tell him
or he'll toss it out.

523
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:53,970
He's an airhead.

524
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:56,040
- Bye.
- Have a nice day.

525
00:54:34,550 --> 00:54:36,170
The country's so beautiful.

526
00:54:38,550 --> 00:54:39,920
We tend to forget.

527
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:56,220
Audrey Hepburn!

528
00:54:57,970 --> 00:54:59,670
Breakfast at Tiffany's.

529
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:02,840
That's where it's from! I forgot!

530
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:05,130
I adore Audrey Hepburn!

531
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:06,550
Me…

532
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:15,050
Gotta piss. Be right back.

533
00:55:20,470 --> 00:55:21,410
Marie?

534
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:24,840
I love you.

535
00:55:25,470 --> 00:55:26,580
I love you too.

536
00:55:27,470 --> 00:55:29,920
Frankie, too. I love the dude.

537
00:55:30,090 --> 00:55:31,750
I mean, he's so sweet!

538
00:55:32,470 --> 00:55:34,540
- A bit shy, but…
- Over-sensitive?

539
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:36,130
Yeah.

540
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:38,960
In what way, sensitive?

541
00:55:39,130 --> 00:55:40,080
No, nothing.

542
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:47,880
No, it's just he's…

543
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,000
He's a romantic.

544
00:55:52,130 --> 00:55:54,090
He imagines things about people.

545
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:01,210
What do you mean?

546
00:56:05,090 --> 00:56:07,170
It's just he imagines things,

547
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:10,000
about anything, anyone…

548
00:56:10,510 --> 00:56:13,040
If you give him too much affection,

549
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:14,920
or touch him too much…

550
00:56:16,510 --> 00:56:17,710
Like, for him,

551
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:20,000
"I love you" is

552
00:56:20,970 --> 00:56:22,250
"I love you."

553
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,290
You can say it to me.

554
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,800
I understand these kind of things.

555
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:31,460
But him…

556
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:33,960
Anyway…

557
00:56:38,010 --> 00:56:39,880
Lunch is on me.

558
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:00,550
River.

559
00:57:02,550 --> 00:57:04,340
Yeah, it's beautiful.

560
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:05,460
It's crazy.

561
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:20,630
Yeah, the country is beautiful.

562
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:27,290
You forget everything.

563
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:30,790
All the shit that drives you crazy.

564
00:57:31,470 --> 00:57:32,550
You forget.

565
00:58:47,470 --> 00:58:49,040
Next marshmallow?

566
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:50,460
Not me, thanks.

567
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:51,550
Frankie?

568
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:53,160
OK.

569
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:59,920
You don't know how to eat 'em.

570
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:05,040
Why?

571
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:07,800
You eat your marshmallow too fast.

572
00:59:09,130 --> 00:59:11,090
You're not tasting it.

573
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:14,300
A marshmallow's like a striptease.

574
00:59:14,470 --> 00:59:16,130
Step by step.

575
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,210
- Have another…
- No.

576
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:19,500
Man, I'm full, I swear.

577
00:59:20,010 --> 00:59:21,040
Come on.

578
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:27,670
Now do as I say
Start by taking off its coat.

579
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:28,510
Come again?

580
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:31,290
Its coat.
Its little peel, its skin.

581
00:59:31,590 --> 00:59:34,000
The burned, golden layer.

582
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:35,700
Start with that.

583
00:59:36,050 --> 00:59:37,130
OK.

584
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:40,500
Good start. Now,

585
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:45,250
using your palate and incisors,
pull off the second part

586
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:48,290
by applying a teeny
slight pressure.

587
00:59:48,470 --> 00:59:49,960
But you leave…

588
00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:52,370
you leave a thin core.

589
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:56,040
And then…

590
01:00:00,010 --> 01:00:01,500
You're so drunk.

591
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:04,540
OK, I'm going to bed.

592
01:00:05,590 --> 01:00:06,840
You're angry?

593
01:00:07,090 --> 01:00:08,670
No no, just tired.

594
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:12,090
- You OK?
- Yeah, yeah.

595
01:01:24,670 --> 01:01:25,870
Guys?

596
01:02:35,510 --> 01:02:37,460
Whatever! Whatever!

597
01:02:37,970 --> 01:02:39,760
Whatever! Whatever!

598
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:09,540
Yeah, it's me.

599
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:11,700
Yes, on the cliff.

600
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:15,510
Yes. No, I'm going to take the bus.

601
01:03:15,670 --> 01:03:19,170
An emergency. I forgot I had
an emergency in Montréal.

602
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:21,420
I'll take the bus in an hour.

603
01:03:22,220 --> 01:03:24,590
Don't go to any trouble for me.
It's fine.

604
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:26,340
I'll just take the bus.

605
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:27,580
Bye.

606
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:46,660
Marie!

607
01:03:48,380 --> 01:03:49,500
Wait!

608
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:07,090
Marie, fuck!

609
01:04:38,170 --> 01:04:39,920
What's your fucking problem?

610
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:36,420
Hey, guys?

611
01:05:47,050 --> 01:05:48,710
I've had it with the country.

612
01:05:49,010 --> 01:05:50,120
I'm going home.

613
01:05:53,010 --> 01:05:54,250
Love me or leave me.

614
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:28,760
We've been waiting
outside the hotel for

615
01:06:29,420 --> 01:06:30,970
15, even 25 minutes.

616
01:06:31,170 --> 01:06:31,960
Endless!

617
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:34,250
It's raining.

618
01:06:34,420 --> 01:06:37,040
A bitchy little drizzle like,
you know,

619
01:06:37,220 --> 01:06:39,840
someone's goddamn spitting
in your face.

620
01:06:40,550 --> 01:06:43,330
My balls are ice cold,
I'm insanely bored.

621
01:06:43,510 --> 01:06:45,420
Julie's reading some poems by…

622
01:06:45,590 --> 01:06:47,300
Jacques Brault.

623
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:50,790
It's taking forever,
he's late, we're bored.

624
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:54,260
But Julie's gonna shoot herself
if we bail.

625
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:56,460
There's an old doorman
from Colorado.

626
01:06:56,630 --> 01:07:00,840
No idea what he's doing there.
But he's nice so we chat.

627
01:07:01,470 --> 01:07:02,630
Finally he shows up.

628
01:07:04,090 --> 01:07:05,550
That bitch is like…

629
01:07:06,470 --> 01:07:07,460
45 minutes late.

630
01:07:08,260 --> 01:07:09,000
He's wearing

631
01:07:09,170 --> 01:07:11,960
his vintage Navy jacket.

632
01:07:12,380 --> 01:07:14,260
He's cute. He's tall and…

633
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:17,250
We're there so Julie
can make her move.

634
01:07:17,420 --> 01:07:19,580
It's now or never. Problem is,

635
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:21,880
the guy

636
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:23,500
is with someone.

637
01:07:24,590 --> 01:07:25,840
Another guy!

638
01:07:26,260 --> 01:07:29,290
Also cute and tall.
I glance at Julie.

639
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:31,830
Her face looks like shit.

640
01:07:33,510 --> 01:07:34,210
Dude's like,

641
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:37,420
"Sorry, I lost. I late."

642
01:07:38,260 --> 01:07:40,460
You don't call, you don't write,

643
01:07:40,630 --> 01:07:42,170
or talk to her. Over.

644
01:07:43,510 --> 01:07:45,660
If you know she's at
a party or bar,

645
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:47,420
you don't go.

646
01:07:48,970 --> 01:07:51,370
It took me about a year.

647
01:07:53,170 --> 01:07:55,250
The lucky ones get over it

648
01:07:55,420 --> 01:07:57,790
in two weeks, two months,
two days…

649
01:08:00,470 --> 01:08:02,260
Every time I saw her I figured

650
01:08:02,420 --> 01:08:05,510
I'd get cramps,
be jealous of her new BF.

651
01:08:07,260 --> 01:08:08,290
But no.

652
01:08:10,050 --> 01:08:11,590
I got over it.

653
01:08:13,010 --> 01:08:14,800
Autumn leaves fell,

654
01:08:14,970 --> 01:08:17,290
snow came.

655
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:20,590
Christmas, and my cousins
with their dumb girlfriends.

656
01:08:21,670 --> 01:08:24,160
Spring, summer, fall and…

657
01:08:25,420 --> 01:08:26,420
I got over it.

658
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:29,420
Just a bad memory.

659
01:08:31,260 --> 01:08:32,500
A memory like many others.

660
01:08:35,630 --> 01:08:37,170
When I think of what I did,

661
01:08:37,340 --> 01:08:40,130
the money I blew
to get her to love me…

662
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:43,500
I think of it all and

663
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:48,410
I'm so ashamed that…

664
01:08:55,220 --> 01:08:56,540
I start to…

665
01:08:58,550 --> 01:08:59,750
to sing.

666
01:09:00,590 --> 01:09:02,170
To sing, fuck!

667
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:05,340
I sing in the living room,
in the shower,

668
01:09:05,510 --> 01:09:07,080
doing the dishes.

669
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:08,840
I sing.

670
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:13,420
I hit Send.

671
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:16,510
I mean, enough's enough.

672
01:09:17,010 --> 01:09:20,670
Smell the coffee.
Not spend my whole life on Hotmail.

673
01:09:21,970 --> 01:09:24,500
I mean, it's cute at first, but…

674
01:09:27,050 --> 01:09:28,670
It's such a high.

675
01:09:29,590 --> 01:09:31,300
You know, the feeling

676
01:09:31,470 --> 01:09:33,870
when your Inbox has new messages,

677
01:09:34,050 --> 01:09:35,210
in bold.

678
01:09:35,510 --> 01:09:37,710
You have mail!

679
01:09:39,170 --> 01:09:41,170
The nanosecond after you click

680
01:09:42,670 --> 01:09:43,870
and it appears.

681
01:09:45,420 --> 01:09:46,500
He wrote.

682
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:50,710
You're even happier cause twice

683
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:52,870
your Inbox's been in bold.

684
01:09:53,050 --> 01:09:55,670
An email from fucking Amazon.ca!

685
01:09:56,090 --> 01:09:58,380
Or a lampshade warehouse sale.

686
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:02,080
I'm in a café. I'm waiting for him.

687
01:10:03,170 --> 01:10:04,370
And he's late.

688
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:07,550
But only a minute,
so it's not serious.

689
01:10:09,420 --> 01:10:11,050
So, stage one:

690
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:13,840
loving his being late.

691
01:10:14,260 --> 01:10:16,410
You go, It makes him human,

692
01:10:16,590 --> 01:10:18,300
gives him sex appeal.

693
01:10:18,470 --> 01:10:19,380
Stage two:

694
01:10:19,550 --> 01:10:22,040
Checking my agenda. You know,

695
01:10:22,470 --> 01:10:24,260
I question myself.

696
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:27,260
Maybe I got it wrong.
I invent scenarios.

697
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:30,710
I picture myself arriving late
at another café.

698
01:10:31,130 --> 01:10:33,090
So I look where I am and

699
01:10:33,670 --> 01:10:36,050
I'm in the right place.

700
01:10:36,260 --> 01:10:37,920
It's been 32 minutes.

701
01:10:39,470 --> 01:10:40,500
Stage three:

702
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:44,050
I tell myself I don't mind waiting.

703
01:10:45,510 --> 01:10:47,580
I keep myself busy, I read.

704
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:50,800
I pretend to read.
The same fucking paragraph.

705
01:10:50,970 --> 01:10:53,540
I go to the bathroom, order stuff.

706
01:10:54,260 --> 01:10:55,540
Now I hate him.

707
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:57,790
I insult him in my head.

708
01:10:58,090 --> 01:11:02,000
I think of cool quotes that'll be
perfect for when he shows up.

709
01:11:02,170 --> 01:11:04,170
It's been 39 minutes.

710
01:11:07,220 --> 01:11:08,300
He arrives.

711
01:11:08,970 --> 01:11:10,420
All out of breath.

712
01:11:11,510 --> 01:11:12,710
Handsome.

713
01:11:14,380 --> 01:11:16,040
Traffic was bad.

714
01:11:17,050 --> 01:11:18,000
Yeah.

715
01:11:19,170 --> 01:11:21,330
So I excuse him. I say,

716
01:11:21,590 --> 01:11:24,260
of course, only normal
that he's late.

717
01:11:26,050 --> 01:11:27,160
Cause…

718
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:30,160
Cause I'm weak and

719
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:33,580
someone you put on a pedestal
is always right.

720
01:11:37,970 --> 01:11:39,250
Fuck it.

721
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:40,700
Rejection's tough but…

722
01:11:41,420 --> 01:11:42,500
it's over with.

723
01:11:45,340 --> 01:11:46,250
No?

724
01:11:49,380 --> 01:11:51,290
It's like a guillotine.

725
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:54,160
But…

726
01:11:54,420 --> 01:11:56,080
waiting for an answer,

727
01:11:56,920 --> 01:11:59,300
spending weeks thinking I'm shit,

728
01:11:59,470 --> 01:12:01,750
while he goes, Is she crazy?

729
01:12:02,420 --> 01:12:05,460
It's like getting your head
chopped off in slo-mo.

730
01:12:06,130 --> 01:12:08,590
It's like a long, lingering No.

731
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:12,500
But at a certain point,

732
01:12:13,510 --> 01:12:15,080
you get fed up.

733
01:12:15,470 --> 01:12:17,040
You crack.

734
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:19,340
You crack and

735
01:12:19,510 --> 01:12:21,300
everything's filthy.

736
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:23,800
Everything's dark and

737
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:25,340
burned out.

738
01:12:27,050 --> 01:12:29,010
So I hit Send.

739
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:48,090
You're smoking a lot.

740
01:12:48,590 --> 01:12:50,300
Compared to last time.

741
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:54,380
I smoked as much then.

742
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:03,800
I love to smoke.

743
01:13:04,130 --> 01:13:05,710
Smoking a cigarette is like

744
01:13:07,380 --> 01:13:08,300
forgetting.

745
01:13:09,340 --> 01:13:11,380
When I hit rock bottom
it's all I have.

746
01:13:11,550 --> 01:13:14,090
Light up, smoke up,
shut the fuck up.

747
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:17,300
It hides the shit.

748
01:13:19,510 --> 01:13:21,380
The smoke hides

749
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:25,000
the shit.

750
01:13:28,510 --> 01:13:30,420
There's menthol and vanilla.

751
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:32,210
Some people like 'em.

752
01:13:33,170 --> 01:13:34,340
Menthol cigarette.

753
01:13:34,510 --> 01:13:36,000
Vanilla cigarette.

754
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:38,510
Chocolate cigarette.

755
01:13:39,340 --> 01:13:41,050
Cigarette cigarette.

756
01:13:44,380 --> 01:13:46,210
Cigarettes clearly keep me

757
01:13:47,260 --> 01:13:48,460
from going crazy.

758
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:52,090
Keeps me alive.

759
01:13:57,010 --> 01:13:58,500
It keeps me alive

760
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:00,710
until I die.

761
01:14:13,420 --> 01:14:14,460
Are you

762
01:14:15,090 --> 01:14:15,960
all right?

763
01:15:28,090 --> 01:15:29,500
First snowfall!

764
01:15:30,470 --> 01:15:31,580
So,

765
01:15:32,050 --> 01:15:35,710
it's been a while since
we saw each other in the country.

766
01:15:36,470 --> 01:15:38,370
And I was wondering,

767
01:15:38,590 --> 01:15:41,420
if there was some misunderstanding,
or awkwardness?

768
01:15:41,590 --> 01:15:44,000
If you were angry or…

769
01:15:44,170 --> 01:15:47,460
You know, about the episode of our

770
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:48,880
bucolic wrestle.

771
01:15:50,970 --> 01:15:54,550
That's it. Just a little game
between Marie and me.

772
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:56,170
We're old friends.

773
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:58,540
I thought of you because

774
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:01,340
they're showing
My Fair Lady on TV.

775
01:16:01,630 --> 01:16:04,090
I saw it in the TV listings.

776
01:16:05,220 --> 01:16:07,750
My Fair Lady's on tonight.
I called

777
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:10,250
cause I thought
it'd be fun to watch.

778
01:16:11,050 --> 01:16:13,010
It'd be fun to watch together.

779
01:16:13,470 --> 01:16:15,500
If you feel like it. Here.

780
01:16:16,380 --> 01:16:17,760
Or at your place or…

781
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:19,550
Anyway, if you're not busy.

782
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:21,920
So then…

783
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:09,090
Yes, this is Nicolas's voice mail.

784
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:11,000
So leave me a message.

785
01:19:28,550 --> 01:19:32,760
I wait for you in the season
that is ours

786
01:20:30,340 --> 01:20:31,920
We have to talk.

787
01:20:33,380 --> 01:20:35,790
No, you know, I'm someone who…

788
01:20:37,630 --> 01:20:38,710
No, I…

789
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:40,260
I like being with you.

790
01:20:41,220 --> 01:20:42,590
I feel…

791
01:20:44,470 --> 01:20:47,130
I feel good.
Yeah, I like being with you.

792
01:20:48,970 --> 01:20:49,710
OK.

793
01:20:50,010 --> 01:20:51,000
Imagine…

794
01:20:51,970 --> 01:20:53,130
Imagine that

795
01:20:53,550 --> 01:20:55,460
let's say, we have a friend

796
01:20:55,880 --> 01:20:58,370
and he meets a guy.

797
01:20:59,130 --> 01:21:00,960
He meets a nice guy,

798
01:21:01,130 --> 01:21:03,090
funny, charming,

799
01:21:04,010 --> 01:21:05,340
handsome, of course.

800
01:21:05,550 --> 01:21:07,920
He's intelligent. He's…

801
01:21:11,550 --> 01:21:13,040
cultivated.

802
01:21:13,260 --> 01:21:15,960
Very open-minded.
So much that you go,

803
01:21:16,130 --> 01:21:18,670
"Wow, he's so open-minded!"
You're touched.

804
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:21,000
That's what seduces you,
touches you.

805
01:21:21,170 --> 01:21:23,920
He touches you.
He's tender and fun.

806
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:30,710
Let's say you meet this nice guy,
what do you do?

807
01:21:35,340 --> 01:21:36,420
I love you.

808
01:21:44,170 --> 01:21:45,800
I really want to kiss you.

809
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:57,450
I don't know why
I'm telling you this.

810
01:22:01,340 --> 01:22:02,880
No, it's just that,

811
01:22:03,340 --> 01:22:05,000
it's the end of fall.

812
01:22:05,590 --> 01:22:07,880
I'll have to start heating my place.

813
01:22:08,300 --> 01:22:11,210
And it would be simpler
if there were someone…

814
01:22:12,090 --> 01:22:13,710
If there were someone.

815
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:15,960
It's simpler if there is someone.

816
01:22:22,970 --> 01:22:25,920
And also, I haven't told you
about my marks

817
01:22:26,090 --> 01:22:26,870
like…

818
01:22:29,970 --> 01:22:30,910
Christ!

819
01:22:31,510 --> 01:22:34,000
Robinson Crusoe. I put a mark to…

820
01:22:35,260 --> 01:22:36,340
You know, when…

821
01:22:37,340 --> 01:22:39,050
someone tells me, "No, thanks."

822
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:41,420
"No. Thanks,
but I'm not interested."

823
01:22:41,590 --> 01:22:44,870
Whenever that happens
I add another little mark.

824
01:22:45,630 --> 01:22:46,830
But now I'm just

825
01:22:47,630 --> 01:22:51,210
tired of it. They help me
make a clean break.

826
01:22:51,420 --> 01:22:52,830
Know what I mean?

827
01:22:57,720 --> 01:22:58,800
So…

828
01:23:00,260 --> 01:23:01,120
You?

829
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:03,800
Talk to me.

830
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:18,920
How could you think I was gay?

831
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:16,630
Excuse me a sec.

832
01:24:21,090 --> 01:24:22,090
Nico?

833
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:30,000
Hello!

834
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:31,710
Hi!

835
01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:33,670
- How are you?
- Good.

836
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:36,880
It's been so long. I spotted you.
It's been ages.

837
01:24:37,050 --> 01:24:38,920
Sorry, I was completely…

838
01:24:39,090 --> 01:24:41,790
That's OK, it doesn't matter.

839
01:24:41,970 --> 01:24:43,710
We're both busy. It's…

840
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:46,590
I called once
but didn't leave a message.

841
01:24:46,760 --> 01:24:49,210
Wasn't important.
But I had a friend.

842
01:24:49,720 --> 01:24:52,250
From Matane.
She'd just got back from a trip.

843
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:54,550
Évelyne. And she…

844
01:24:55,300 --> 01:24:57,460
Yeah,
she was reading her mail and…

845
01:24:58,170 --> 01:25:00,660
Cause, I'd sent her a letter.

846
01:25:01,050 --> 01:25:03,670
I sent her a letter with an article,

847
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:06,300
an article by Peter Schlag

848
01:25:06,470 --> 01:25:09,300
in the Boston Observer.
I dunno if you…

849
01:25:09,470 --> 01:25:12,550
It's a literary review.

850
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:16,330
It was an article about…

851
01:25:16,550 --> 01:25:20,410
Remains of Fascism
in Modern Literature.

852
01:25:21,170 --> 01:25:23,050
It's amazing!

853
01:25:24,050 --> 01:25:26,460
I'm going on and on.
But what I mean is,

854
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:30,550
it's to you that I wanted to send

855
01:25:30,720 --> 01:25:32,260
the article.

856
01:25:32,420 --> 01:25:35,710
And to her that I wanted to send…
You got the poem?

857
01:25:36,050 --> 01:25:38,720
It's to her I wanted to send
the Miron poem.

858
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:41,920
I sent them the same night.
I mixed up the addresses.

859
01:25:42,420 --> 01:25:45,290
So you ended up with
the poem by Miron.

860
01:25:46,010 --> 01:25:48,540
I could see you reading the poem.

861
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:51,170
It was pretty heavy but it wasn't

862
01:25:51,340 --> 01:25:54,090
the goal of the exercise.

863
01:25:55,880 --> 01:25:58,120
Your friend,

864
01:25:58,300 --> 01:25:59,580
is she your girlfriend?

865
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:00,460
Pardon?

866
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:02,460
The girl,

867
01:26:02,670 --> 01:26:04,710
is she your lover? Your ex? Or…

868
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:06,540
No, not at all.

869
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:08,840
No, it was just her birthday.

870
01:26:09,010 --> 01:26:12,260
She likes Miron and I thought…
I'd sent her…

871
01:26:12,920 --> 01:26:13,960
the poem.

872
01:26:15,340 --> 01:26:18,590
Sorry, I have to run.
I've got something on the stove.

873
01:26:20,130 --> 01:26:21,130
So…

874
01:26:28,340 --> 01:26:30,330
Nico! Nicolas!

875
01:26:38,170 --> 01:26:40,130
What would you say if,

876
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:42,420
if I'd sent the poem to you?

877
01:26:47,300 --> 01:26:48,460
I'd…

878
01:26:49,300 --> 01:26:51,260
still have something on the stove.

879
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:44,840
Sorry.

880
01:28:01,260 --> 01:28:02,120
Fuck!

881
01:29:31,880 --> 01:29:33,080
I know it was him.

882
01:29:34,260 --> 01:29:36,920
I'll never love anyone else
that much. Tough.

883
01:29:37,090 --> 01:29:38,040
I can handle it.

884
01:29:38,920 --> 01:29:40,470
I know it's usually

885
01:29:41,090 --> 01:29:43,960
later in life that you meet
your soul mate.

886
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:46,960
Me, too bad. It happened now,

887
01:29:47,130 --> 01:29:48,300
when I'm 25.

888
01:29:50,010 --> 01:29:52,500
It's not even about sex.
I don't care about sex.

889
01:29:53,300 --> 01:29:55,010
That's not the main thing.

890
01:29:57,220 --> 01:29:58,710
What's important is

891
01:29:59,590 --> 01:30:01,210
to wake up with someone.

892
01:30:02,670 --> 01:30:04,080
To spoon with that person.

893
01:30:06,670 --> 01:30:08,380
That's what matters, the spoon.

894
01:30:12,970 --> 01:30:15,000
Knowing that if a bad guy comes,

895
01:30:15,340 --> 01:30:16,620
someone's there.

896
01:30:18,380 --> 01:30:20,870
That's a metaphor.
Bad guys never come.

897
01:30:26,050 --> 01:30:27,920
You wake up with the wind,

898
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:31,000
a warm belly,
the one who loves you

899
01:30:31,170 --> 01:30:33,000
breathing against your shoulder.

900
01:30:35,220 --> 01:30:36,160
That's it,

901
01:30:37,340 --> 01:30:38,370
the spoon.

902
01:30:40,010 --> 01:30:40,870
Yeah.

903
01:30:42,090 --> 01:30:43,370
I must seem…

904
01:30:44,420 --> 01:30:47,340
Ever met a downer like me
or am I the first?

905
01:30:47,510 --> 01:30:50,380
Oh boy! I've been a hairdresser
20 years,

906
01:30:50,550 --> 01:30:52,750
I've styled single spoons galore.

907
01:31:03,630 --> 01:31:06,550
Hello, Francis Riverëkim,

908
01:31:08,090 --> 01:31:10,130
I went shopping at Beverley's

909
01:31:10,300 --> 01:31:12,130
and bought mismatched cups

910
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:14,340
to serve tea.

911
01:31:14,550 --> 01:31:17,300
So, I don't know if you're free,

912
01:31:17,470 --> 01:31:20,090
but you're invited
for afternoon tea.

913
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:22,170
So call me back.

914
01:31:22,840 --> 01:31:25,880
Oh, I quit smoking. Call me. Bye.

915
01:31:36,470 --> 01:31:37,660
I'm out of madeleines.

916
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:46,080
Love your stubble.

917
01:31:46,760 --> 01:31:47,670
Thanks.

918
01:31:48,510 --> 01:31:50,660
You've joined the club of bears?

919
01:32:00,380 --> 01:32:02,170
Here's that armchair.

920
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:05,330
The armchair I mentioned.

921
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:07,880
Yeah, right.

922
01:32:13,510 --> 01:32:15,050
Have you seen Nico?

923
01:32:17,300 --> 01:32:18,080
Yes.

924
01:32:18,840 --> 01:32:20,380
I saw him in a bar.

925
01:32:21,420 --> 01:32:22,920
Did you go together?

926
01:32:24,300 --> 01:32:25,920
No I was having a drink.

927
01:32:26,090 --> 01:32:28,330
He came in with friends.
I just said hi.

928
01:32:34,720 --> 01:32:36,170
He's going to Asia.

929
01:32:37,720 --> 01:32:38,580
Is he?

930
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:39,870
Eight months.

931
01:32:41,630 --> 01:32:42,630
Long time.

932
01:32:51,260 --> 01:32:52,540
Have you seen him?

933
01:33:01,670 --> 01:33:02,750
More tea?

934
01:33:03,550 --> 01:33:04,660
Sure, good idea.

935
01:34:25,380 --> 01:34:29,420
One year later

936
01:35:26,920 --> 01:35:31,550
That repellent Rockabilly looks like
a foetus-eating queen from Gehenna.

937
01:35:34,050 --> 01:35:35,290
Yuck!

938
01:35:57,720 --> 01:35:58,800
I'm really glad…
