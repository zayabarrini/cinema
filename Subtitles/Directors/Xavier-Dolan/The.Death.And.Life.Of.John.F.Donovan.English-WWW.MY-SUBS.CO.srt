00:00:46,541 --> 00:00:48,083
John, it's me!

4
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:55,375
John, come on! Open the door !
I have your box.

5
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:07,875
Oh my God !

6
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,166
It smells good here!

7
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:17,416
When did you open a window
for the last time ?

8
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:24,541
John, where are you?
I do not have a lot of time.

9
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:28,250
It's dark here.

10
00:01:35,416 --> 00:01:38,916
Did you ask for the place
where Sid Vicious is deceased

11
00:01:40,916 --> 00:01:42,458
John?

12
00:01:45,708 --> 00:01:47,458
John, are you there?

13
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,541
- What was the letter saying?
- Honey, I do not know.

14
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:09,666
What do you mean ?

15
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:12,041
You said to have reported it
at the reception.

16
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:13,500
I did not say I did not know.

17
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:16,250
You just did it.
You said, "I do not know."

18
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:19,291
Rupert
the letter was not for you.

19
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:21,250
The reception made a mistake.

20
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:24,791
And return it without showing it to me
was just irrepressible?

21
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,000
Rupert, that's enough!

22
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:31,791
This is my first opportunity

23
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:33,791
to meet him
after all these years.

24
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:37,666
Honey, I know,
but you have a big day.

25
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:39,875
- Did you open the letter?
- Yes.

26
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:41,625
You saw that it was not for me ...

27
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:43,208
Yes, I already apologized.

28
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:45,625
... and you just brought it back
at the reception ?

29
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,250
- Yes.
- Well...

30
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:49,541
The reception could not have
send me the wrong letter

31
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:51,916
if she did not have one for me.

32
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:54,666
They sent my letter
to the wrong person.

33
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:57,083
So, a letter is waiting for me at the hotel.

34
00:02:58,333 --> 00:02:59,541
Yes.

35
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:01,916
Yes surely.

36
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:05,708
Take something to eat ...

37
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:08,583
what you want,

38
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,291
and I call them right away.

39
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:15,625
Listen, we'll go to the hotel,

40
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:18,583
and I'm sure
that a letter will await you there,

41
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,041
and that you will meet
this afternoon.

42
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:25,416
It was written in green ink?

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,416
What?

44
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:31,375
It was written in green ink?

45
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,458
I do not remember.

46
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:45,750
Honey, everything will be fine, okay?

47
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,958

00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:23,875
Shit.

00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:35,541
Hal, it's me.

56
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:38,791
Do not do this to me.
I have a flight to London at 14:30.

57
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:42,625
My date in Paris
was shifted, right?

58
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:45,750
I got your email this morning.

59
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:48,708
I could not answer,
my router was messing up.

60
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:51,125
Listen to me.

61
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:55,125
I came to greet him because
I am a civilized woman.

62
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:58,000
But you can not force me
to write an article.

63
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:01,416
I do not care,
send another reporter,

64
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:02,541
postpones the interview.

65
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:05,458
Robert Turner of my two
do not go flying!

66
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:08,833
I do not care to scratch his name,
I will not do it.

67
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:14,458
I did not even read his stupid book.

68
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,458
How can I interview someone
if I have not read ...

69
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:22,250
You see me writing
on a trend actor

70
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:26,166
who exhumes his past
only to boost his career?

71
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:28,333
I'm better than that.

72
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:36,375
Okay.

73
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:38,500
Yes, I have nothing more to say to you.

74
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:40,583
I will do it.

75
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:42,291
One o'clock.

76
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:44,958
If this little brat
allow himself the slightest arrogance,

77
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:46,791
I do not answer for anything.

78
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:51,916
Yeah. Hi, Hal.

79
00:06:56,625 --> 00:07:00,708
It's crazy that they still have
public telephones in 2017.

80
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:05,875
It's pretty coherent
with the rest of Eastern Europe.

81

Production gives us
rotten notebooks

82

I call
and I join you for the interview.

84
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:17,916
I'm really looking forward.

85
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:19,750
I will settle down ...

86
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:23,000

We do not feed you, in the <i> Times? </ I>

99

Simple curiosity, of course.
There is no arrogance.

100
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:04,583
The arrogant actor rushes
in the Art Nouveau café,

101
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,750
disheveled, sporting
an old army jacket.

102
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:09,291
I feel it well.

103
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:11,958
I had forgotten
that we could smoke here.

104
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:14,875
It will be forbidden
in a few months, alas.

105
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:16,625
Did you like the book?

106
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:21,625
As you know,
I did not read it.

107
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:24,083
I was not supposed
do this interview.

108
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,208
But since we are here,

109
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:28,666
let's start, I have a plane to take.

110
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:31,416
Yesterday afternoon,
when I was told it would be you,

111
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:32,750
I read some of your articles.

112
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:34,083
Yesterday afternoon ?

113
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,583
You are versatile
for a political journalist.

114
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:40,083
You have co-authored an article
on the ecological apocalypse.

115
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,000
On what, already? The West Coast...

116
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:44,375
- The fault of Juan de Fuca.
- That's it.

117
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:47,000
An earthquake of 9.2
will devastate the West Coast.

118
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:49,125
And is it planned for when, already?

119
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:50,833
We are 50 years behind.

120
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,625
It could be 20 years from now,

121
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:54,750
and we will not have
started the interview.

122
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:56,750
Do not save?

123
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:06,000
Please ?

124
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:08,958
I would like a very big american.

125
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:10,916
Do you take something?

126
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,666
A double espresso, please.

127
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:17,291
A double espresso deca
for this triple idiot.

128
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:18,958
Thank you.

129
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:23,666
She spoke in foreign languages
and he was in his power.

130
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:26,875
I was afraid you were not talking
from you in the third person.

131
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:29,458
Now,
I would like us to start,

132
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:30,958
and I may have my plane.

133
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:34,708
If you miss it,
this device will take you to London.

134
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,041
You want
do I write this article?

135
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,500
Yes ? Well.

136
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,041
We all remember the scandal,

137
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:57,833
how the letters
have been made public, etc.

138
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,541
Can you go back to the beginning,

139
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:03,416
when it all started
with John F. Donovan?

140
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,375
In fact, we know it.

141
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,625
He answered one of your letters.

142
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:11,833
And an unlikely match
followed.

143
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,166
This is the fairy tale version.

144
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,625
We could come back ...

145
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:18,583
At the end of the fairy tale?

146
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,500
If you want.

147
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:23,208
It was in 2006.

148
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:25,458
The summer of my 11 years.

149
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,708
I still smell
of the felt pen he used.

150
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:36,625
I can still hear the pen
scratch the paper.

151
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:39,833
Our letters were handwritten,
no computer, no mails.

152
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:45,125
For John, everything collapsed
when he started to take off.

153
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:48,500
Everybody
noticed the new kid

154
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,416
and said he was going to box.

155
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,166
But for us,

156
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,791
who had followed it since the beginning,

157
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:59,583
it was evident
that he was already carding.

158
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:03,291
Really.

159
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:07,166
MY LIFE WITH JOHN F. DONOVAN

160
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:14,250
No, send me
a recap from our discussion.

161
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:15,250
You've been great.

162
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:17,250
We will choose the photos?

163
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:18,958
You really believe in Santa Claus.

164
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:20,041
What do you mean ?

165
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:21,250
You're at <i> Vanity Fair. </ I>

166
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:24,041
You say that you love
and you stop pissing off.

167
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:26,083
- Rhonda!
- Yes my darling.

168
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:29,000
Great, haystacks.
Thanks beauty.

169
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:31,708
- I have oil everywhere.
- Believe me, it's seller.

170
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:35,208
The minor bottom look a bit slutty,
it works in the Midwest.

171
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:38,875
Prada delivered the costume,
and Mel took it home.

172
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:40,083
Miuccia tells you "shit",

173
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,291
and she gabbled in Italian,
I did not understand anything.

174
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,583
John! The end of the season
was too stylish.

175
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,333
Hidden cameras, and everything.
Very good.

176
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,958
It's nice.

177
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:52,583
Are you going to play Jack Harvest?

178
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,500
It's my favorite superhero!

179
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:57,416
I cross my fingers, it's not sure.

180
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,333
I love you !

181
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:08,750
That's all for today.

182
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:09,791
I love you !

183
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:15,125
I see Chris next week.

184
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:17,750
He knows George wants you
to play Jack Harvest.

185
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,750
It looks good, sweetie.

186
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,166
It's not just for me.

187
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:39,583
Larry would have loved you to come.

188
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,583
- You owe him that.
- I was not here.

189
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:44,541
I love Larry,
but I can not clone myself.

190
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:48,125
All the better, otherwise you would always have
your cock in your mouth.

191
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:49,916
Thank you for this picture.

192
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:51,833
Like you never thought about it.

193
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:29,375
It's the first
of the season of <i> Hellsome High. </ i>

194
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:47,375
I really have a huge chance.

195
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:52,875
Rupert!

196
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:56,166
Rupert?

197
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,291
- Rupert!
- Sorry.

198
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,708
I can not wait to read what you wrote down.

199
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:04,250
I'm sure
that it will be very complete.

200
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:06,375
He was on the gay planet!

201
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:08,791
Cedric, this obsession
for sexuality

202
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:11,125
of your comrade
really worries me.

203
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:12,833
Do not risk.

204
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,333
You will name three enumerations
and four figures of style

205
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,541
in the list
I gave you Tuesday.

206
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:25,333
Please,
I would like to remind you

207
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,708
you need to prepare
your presentations for Monday.

208
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:32,583
Do not forget to choose an object
who has an emotional value

209
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,708
in real life.

210
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:38,208
Do not tell me
your weekend at Hogwarts.

211
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:46,250
<i> School has always
been a refuge for me. </ i>

212
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:50,333
<i> In college, I discovered
the ordinary malice of the guys. </ i>

213
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:52,375
<i> Finally, boys. </ i>

214
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:55,208
<i> To survive in the jungle,
you had to become an animal. </ i>

215
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,333
<i> But I preferred to live in my head
and in front of the TV. </ i>

216
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,833
<i> Another little white guy
who survives the harassment. </ i>

217
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,958
<i> Obviously! </ i>

218
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:06,916
<i> No, for years,
I was only interested in John </ i>

219
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:08,875
<i> and the series
in which he was playing, </ i>

220
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:12,625
my world revolved around that,
at the time.

221
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:17,166
Have you ever confided
this obsession to someone?

222
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:20,875
What kind of interlocutor
you speak ?

223
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,625
I do not know, a professional.

224
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,708
I have not seen...
What is the name of the series?

225
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:27,375
In short ... continue.

226
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,208
What's your name already?

227
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:33,375
- Sorry ?
- I forgot your name.

228
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,791
Audrey Newhouse.

229
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:43,041
Yes sorry.

230
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:47,458
It's not a common name, Audrey.

231
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:51,375
You seem to think
I'm talking about an icon

232
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:53,625
or a very respectable work,

233
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:56,833
or to promote
a cultural event.

234
00:17:57,666 --> 00:18:00,375
But I thought
we were going to talk about influence,

235
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:02,250
identity and TV.

236
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:04,916
If you are looking for
artificial ideas

237
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:07,625
and stupid quotes
to make fun of me,

238
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:08,916
you will be disappointed.

239
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:11,333
It does not talk about the job,
it does not speak of art.

240
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,666
It's about a man
who saved the life of a child.

241
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:18,583
I do not care
that John did not have talent.

242
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:21,708
I do not care
he made shit.

243
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,625
I do not care that his story,

244
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:26,250
today,
you seem appalling.

245
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:29,208
I know
that I do not rebuild Aleppo.

246
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,458
We are in the same camp.

247
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:36,625
And this coffee is a deca, Audrey.

248
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:43,666
Well, we move on.

249
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:48,333
<i> My treasure, </ i>

250
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,708
<i> I could not see you anymore. </ i>

251
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,125
<i> I had to understand. </ i>

252
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:55,416
<i> Mom, I'm 17 years old. </ i>

253
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:58,333
Rather 30.

254
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:07,041
I missed what?
I do not want to miss anything else.

255
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:10,416
Your shoes.
The mother knows.

256
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:13,375
She saw him use
her secret powers, she filmed it.

257
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:14,916
You could say hello.

258
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,333
What? Hello.

259
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,916
Ms. White knows?

260
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:21,375
Of course, hidden cameras
at the end of the season!

261
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:24,875
I can not believe !
Did you see what he did?

262
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:26,833
He shows his powers!

263
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,958
Look! Look at the keys!
The special effects are too good.

264
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:33,083
You received a package.

265
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,125
It must be a poster,
she is on your bed.

266
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:36,375
Okay.

267
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,875
<I> Treasury </ i>

268
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,916
<i> what are you? </ i>

269
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
<i> You were right, mom. </ i>

270
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:44,291
<i> I'm different. </ i>

271
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:46,291
The opening credits arrive.

272
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:47,791
That's it.

273
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,041
I can not believe !

274
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:53,333
It's a new power!

275
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,125
It's downright crazy!

276
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:59,416
Rupert, not so strong.
We have neighbors.

277
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:02,041
I do not believe it, I do not believe it.
The cow !

278
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:04,333
I'm so happy.

279
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:08,750
Mom, are you looking?
Wait, it's <i> Hellsome High! </ I>

280
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,791
I was born to see that.

281
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:13,083
I came out of you for that!

282
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,583
Less strong.

283
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:39,000
<i> My father was gone
when I was 2 years old </ i>

284
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:41,708
<i> and since,
I lived alone with my mother. </ i>

285
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,333
<i> Our departure from the United States
had precipitated </ i>

286
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,750
<i> an impetuous maturity. </ i>

287
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:51,333
<i> My mother and I were barely talking. </ i>

288
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:56,666
<i> But since our arrival here,
I did not go out of my room anymore. </ i>

289
00:20:57,416 --> 00:20:59,166
<i> In college, they made fun of me </ i>

290
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:02,291
<i> because I was the new,
and besides, I was an actor. </ i>

291
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:07,500
<i> But from my point of view,
all my dreams had vanished. </ i>

292
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:12,250
<i> The only one who survived was ... </ i>

293
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:15,000
<I> John. </ I>

294
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,083
It's hard, of course,

295
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,583
he does not have the accent
or the character of an Englishman.

296
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:24,583
So we're looking for roles
American living here,

297
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:28,166
or characters a little apart.

298
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:32,875
I would not tell you it helps him
to digest his arrival here.

299
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:36,208
But he will adapt.

300
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:43,333
<i> I gave up a lot of things
leaving for England, </ i>

301
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,291
<i> but the letters followed. </ i>

302
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:48,333
<i> The night I saw the pilot
of the series in which he was playing, </ i>

303
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,666
<i> I wrote a letter to John. </ i>

304
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:53,291
<i> And to my surprise, he ... </ i>

305
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:55,583
- <i> He replied.
</ i> - <i> Yes. </ i>

306
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:00,166
<i> And what was originally
that a single exchange </ i>

307
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:02,458
<i> continued for years. </ i>

308
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,666
<i> Until his death, actually. </ i>

309
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:20,833
"The style,
it's about who we are. "

310
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,291
<i> Wait a minute. </ i>

311
00:22:22,458 --> 00:22:25,000
<i> And your mother did not know? </ i>

312
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:27,291
<i> How could this
to go unnoticed? </ i>

313
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,625
<i> She has never seen any
of these letters in the mail? </ i>

314
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:34,291
<i> A lot of things have escaped
to my mother's attention at the time. </ i>

315
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:38,041
<i> She was overwhelmed,
she was never home. </ i>

316
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:40,750
<i> I took care of the mail,
anyway. </ i>

317
00:22:40,916 --> 00:22:42,708
<i> You intercepted them. </ i>

318
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:44,708
<I> Yes. </ I>

319
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:47,541
<i> Why? You were not proud? </ I>

320
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:50,708
<i> I was, but more,
I was scared. </ i>

321
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:55,500
<i> Afraid that this so special thing
be removed. </ i>

322
00:22:57,916 --> 00:23:01,041
<i> It was my only link
with the life I dreamed about. </ i>

323
00:23:02,833 --> 00:23:04,541
<i> So, I protected him. </ i>

324
00:23:06,041 --> 00:23:09,833
<i> Until the day I leave
this place to become an actor. </ i>

325
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:13,125
<i> Work with John. </ i>

326
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,666
<i> I knew there was
somewhere a world </ i>

327
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:22,750
<i> where John lived his life. </ i>

328
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,416
<i> Very, very far from mine. </ i>

329
00:23:57,833 --> 00:24:00,375
<i> Amy and John had grown up together. </ i>

330
00:24:01,166 --> 00:24:03,250
<i> They had always been friends. </ i>

331
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,750
<i> Amy was going to New York to realize
her dream of being an actress, </ i>

332
00:24:07,916 --> 00:24:09,583
<i> and he followed it. </ i>

333
00:24:11,541 --> 00:24:15,500
<i> It surprised them that we believe them
together forever, </ i>

334
00:24:15,666 --> 00:24:17,375
<i> but they were playing the game. </ i>

335
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:20,166
<i> And things got chained. </ i>

336
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:24,916
<i> For John, especially. </ i>

337
00:24:27,208 --> 00:24:29,375
<i> He often mentioned loneliness. </ i>

338
00:24:31,375 --> 00:24:34,750
<i> I knew there were relationships
that he could not afford. </ i>

339
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:40,791
<i> How's that, relationships
that he could not </ i>

340
00:24:41,666 --> 00:24:43,166
<i> to afford? </ i>

341
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:46,416
<i> When you have a life like hers, </ i>

342
00:24:46,583 --> 00:24:50,166
<i> everything and everyone
is a risk. </ i>

343
00:24:51,875 --> 00:24:54,416
<i> The attention we so much wanted
becomes ubiquitous </ i>

344
00:24:54,583 --> 00:24:56,416
<i> and we want to run away. </ i>

345
00:25:02,041 --> 00:25:04,250
<i> John often slept in the hotel. </ i>

346
00:25:06,708 --> 00:25:09,708
<i> In one of the first letters,
I asked him why. </ i>

347
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:12,541
<i> He said he felt less lonely. </ i>

348
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:16,625
<i> What's weird,
the hotel being synonymous with loneliness. </ i>

349
00:25:17,125 --> 00:25:22,041
<i> He said that the feeling of loneliness
was relativized by the fact </ i>

350
00:25:22,208 --> 00:25:27,208
<i> that people from neighboring rooms
were often alone too. </ i>

351
00:25:31,208 --> 00:25:33,791
<i> It's pretty big for New York. </ i>

352
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:38,000
<i> You know, it's modest,
it's pretty crappy, </ i>

353
00:25:38,166 --> 00:25:40,333
but it's at home
since a while.

354
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,833
It's not too expensive either.

355
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,291
When Amy and I
have moved into town,

356
00:25:45,458 --> 00:25:47,833
we lived in Queens,
near Flushing.

357
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,458
A real rat hole.

358
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:53,666
We could not afford
electricity the first months,

359
00:25:53,833 --> 00:25:56,375
so we had to light the housing
with candles.

360
00:25:56,541 --> 00:25:58,083
- Shit !
- Yes.

361
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:04,208
One of the neighbors was complaining
that he smelled smoke.

362
00:26:04,375 --> 00:26:05,583
When the firefighters arrived,

363
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:08,541
they had to think
that virgins were sacrificed.

364
00:26:10,958 --> 00:26:13,250
The virgins
have never interested us.

365
00:26:28,666 --> 00:26:31,083
Do you work tomorrow?
Are you shooting?

366
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:33,083
I do not work right now.

367
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:35,958
I must be on the set
from <i> Hellsome </ i> at 7:00.

368
00:26:36,458 --> 00:26:38,416
A crazy day full of waterfalls.

369
00:26:38,583 --> 00:26:40,875
Yes Yes.

370
00:26:41,041 --> 00:26:45,208
I'm taking another beer
and I'm leaving.

371
00:26:45,375 --> 00:26:48,083
I have to start studying,
anyway...

372
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:11,625
I auditioned for <i> Hellsome ... </ i>

373
00:27:11,791 --> 00:27:13,125
I can not.

374
00:27:14,125 --> 00:27:15,041
You can not ?

375
00:27:20,333 --> 00:27:22,083
I have to get up early tomorrow.

376
00:27:25,083 --> 00:27:27,500
Yes, you should rest,
anyway.

377
00:27:27,666 --> 00:27:30,666
7:00 am, it's early.

378
00:27:30,833 --> 00:27:32,250
Yes sorry.

379
00:27:33,375 --> 00:27:36,291
It's good, I'm leaving.

380
00:27:37,666 --> 00:27:38,916
Thank you for the beer.

381
00:27:42,166 --> 00:27:44,833
<i> You know all that
thanks to the letters? </ i>

382
00:27:45,666 --> 00:27:46,916
<i> Not everything. </ i>

383
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:53,166
<i> John never wrote anything
that I can not understand. </ i>

384
00:27:53,333 --> 00:27:55,541
<i> He did not talk much about his private life. </ i>

385
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:58,250
<i> Neither to me nor to others. </ i>

386
00:27:59,958 --> 00:28:04,333
<i> If certain rules were broken,
he said it would destroy him. </ i>

387
00:28:34,291 --> 00:28:36,541
Mom, are you getting up or going to bed?

388
00:28:36,708 --> 00:28:39,791
<i> Faith comes Friday,
if you can free yourself, </ i>

389
00:28:39,958 --> 00:28:43,375
<i> and I make my boeuf bourguignon
that you love. </ i>

390
00:28:43,541 --> 00:28:46,041
I do not love it

391
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:47,083
The 2.

392
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:48,083
I do not hate ...

393
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:51,291
<i> Since when you do not love
the beef bourguignon, Jonathan? </ i>

394
00:28:51,458 --> 00:28:53,208
Since
that you do not listen to people anymore.

395
00:28:53,375 --> 00:28:55,916
And please,
do not call me Jonathan.

396
00:28:56,083 --> 00:28:57,375
<i> I'll do something else for you. </ i>

397
00:28:57,541 --> 00:29:00,666
- The beef, it'll be fine.
- <i> Do not you like "Jonathan"? </ i>

398
00:29:00,833 --> 00:29:03,208
<i> It does not matter,
I can do something else. </ i>

399
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:05,000
I will eat beef.

400
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:13,958
<i> Come on, tell us. Stop your bullshit. </ I>

401
00:30:14,125 --> 00:30:17,750
You did not do 140 km in the middle of the night
to spend some time with me.

402
00:30:24,416 --> 00:30:25,833
His name is Will.

403
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,916
- Oh I see.
- Will Jefford Jr.

404
00:30:28,375 --> 00:30:31,166
I knew him this summer.
We saw each other two or three times.

405
00:30:31,333 --> 00:30:32,541
Okay.

406
00:30:32,708 --> 00:30:34,625
I do not know ... I like him.

407
00:30:37,291 --> 00:30:38,500
He is cute.

408
00:30:40,125 --> 00:30:41,458
What?

409
00:30:41,625 --> 00:30:44,083
I should have said horny?

410
00:30:44,583 --> 00:30:47,833
He is horny.
A guy so horny, it's rare.

411
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,583
Shut your mouth.

412
00:30:51,791 --> 00:30:53,500
What is the plan?

413
00:30:53,666 --> 00:30:55,083
There is no plan.

414
00:30:56,833 --> 00:31:01,666
How many times will you show me
photos with your dreamy smile?

415
00:31:01,833 --> 00:31:04,875
- I do not have a dreamy smile.
- If you do this...

416
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,333
And Amy?

417
00:31:20,291 --> 00:31:21,125
She is used to.

418
00:31:21,291 --> 00:31:23,750
And she continues to play the game?

419
00:31:23,916 --> 00:31:25,291
Yes me too.

420
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:28,458
We're used to it, James.

421
00:31:28,625 --> 00:31:30,291
- It's okay.
- Okay.

422
00:31:51,291 --> 00:31:53,916
You still have not understood.

423
00:32:00,875 --> 00:32:02,000
- No !
- Get out.

424
00:32:02,166 --> 00:32:04,291
Jimmy! Kind of little junk.

425
00:32:04,458 --> 00:32:06,458
Emerges. You know how it ends.

426
00:32:07,166 --> 00:32:08,500
Are you stupid, or what?

427
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:11,041
Will Jefford Jr.

428
00:32:13,708 --> 00:32:16,166
This guy will die
at least 4 minutes after me.

429
00:32:16,583 --> 00:32:17,458
Shut up.

430
00:32:17,625 --> 00:32:20,500
Did you see the seconds he wins
by contracting the words?

431
00:32:20,666 --> 00:32:23,500
It's bluffing. It impresses you?

432
00:32:23,666 --> 00:32:25,750
- He is intelligent.
- It is true ?

433
00:32:26,666 --> 00:32:28,000
I give it back to you, my prince.

434
00:32:28,166 --> 00:32:32,958
Or rather ... "I give it back",
since we contract.

435
00:32:35,666 --> 00:32:39,333
<i> John was going to see Jimmy at his garage
for their ritual for years. </ i>

436
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:41,791
<i> It's Jimmy who told me. </ i>

443

Hello Little Girl.

458
00:34:39,833 --> 00:34:42,125
Rupert! What are you doing here ?

459
00:34:42,291 --> 00:34:43,333
Mom is late.

460
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:45,833
You got hurt ?

461
00:34:46,291 --> 00:34:47,333
I fell.

462
00:34:48,875 --> 00:34:50,041
I see.

463
00:34:53,125 --> 00:34:57,416
"You can only board

465
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:02,375
What cruelty!

466
00:35:02,541 --> 00:35:03,583
But I love !

467
00:35:04,125 --> 00:35:05,833
Here.

00:35:07,166 --> 00:35:08,583
You play well.

469
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:10,541
Stop, I'm bad.

470
00:35:11,333 --> 00:35:12,208
Keep on going.

471
00:35:12,833 --> 00:35:16,041
"I know you do not leave anyone

473
00:35:20,166 --> 00:35:21,333
Sorry, it's gone.

474
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,791
It is not serious.

475
00:35:23,375 --> 00:35:25,333
It's a friendship necklace?

476
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:28,833
I had one.

477
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,333
No, surely not. My mother has the same.

478
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,916
I have the initial of his name,
and she has mine.

479
00:35:36,083 --> 00:35:37,791
How beautiful it is !

480
00:35:38,583 --> 00:35:39,875
Yes.

481
00:35:42,125 --> 00:35:44,000
The party is over.

482
00:35:45,958 --> 00:35:48,083
Where were you ?
I was dead with anxiety.

483
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:50,208
You were late,
Mrs. Kureishi brought me back.

484
00:35:50,375 --> 00:35:53,750
No problem, I stayed
to correct copies.

485
00:35:54,208 --> 00:35:55,458
Thank you, Mrs. Kureishi.

486
00:35:55,958 --> 00:35:58,000
- You got hurt ?
- I fell.

487
00:35:59,083 --> 00:36:00,583
Enter. I'm coming very soon.

488
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:03,583
My turn
to scold me, Rupert!

489
00:36:04,208 --> 00:36:05,750
Not at all.

490
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:11,041
It did not bother me,
I live nearby.

491
00:36:12,166 --> 00:36:15,166
I have Rupert in English class,
the afternoon...

492
00:36:15,333 --> 00:36:17,750
I know who you are, Mrs. Kureishi.

493
00:36:18,041 --> 00:36:21,083
thank you so much
to be busy with Rupert.

494
00:36:25,625 --> 00:36:28,125
<i> I want to know, Rupert.
Who did you do that? </ I>

495
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,208
And stop looking up.

496
00:36:30,375 --> 00:36:33,416
- You do not know what happened.
- I am not blind.

497
00:36:33,583 --> 00:36:35,166
What will it change?

498
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:37,791
Well, it's simple,

499
00:36:37,958 --> 00:36:41,208
if you tell me the names of the kids,
I call their parents.

500
00:36:41,375 --> 00:36:44,083
Mom, it's pathetic!
You disembark.

501
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:47,041
I am small,
I am new, I am an actor.

502
00:36:47,208 --> 00:36:49,583
A tall, who has three girlfriends

503
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:52,083
and who plays in the football team,
Hurt on me.

504
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:54,041
I admire originality.

505
00:36:54,208 --> 00:36:58,291
And Ms. Kureishi says
that scorn is the supreme weapon.

506
00:36:58,458 --> 00:36:59,916
She should write a book.

507
00:37:00,416 --> 00:37:03,958
She likes what she does
and she is a very reliable adult.

508
00:37:05,416 --> 00:37:08,125
If I'm not cool enough
to help you,

509
00:37:08,291 --> 00:37:09,625
make do, okay?

510
00:37:10,125 --> 00:37:13,250
When we have fears,
we must confront them.

511
00:37:13,583 --> 00:37:15,333
Alan Parrish's father said that

512
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,791
and Alan was sucked
by the game Jumanji.

513
00:37:17,958 --> 00:37:19,791
It will be your turn soon.

514
00:37:20,875 --> 00:37:23,541
It is you who say
that you have to face your fears?

515
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:25,166
You are the first to run away.

516
00:37:25,333 --> 00:37:28,083
You fled dad
and your acting profession.

517
00:37:30,708 --> 00:37:34,250
And the thing you put me
on the lips tastes piss!

518
00:37:35,291 --> 00:37:36,500
Dirty kid!

519
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:45,500
That's it! You became a representative?

520
00:37:46,833 --> 00:37:48,416
- I laugh.
- We are late.

521
00:37:48,583 --> 00:37:51,208
What a good surprise !
I did not expect it.

522
00:37:51,375 --> 00:37:53,041
Faith, come!

523
00:37:53,583 --> 00:37:56,250
We had something planned,
but it was canceled.

524
00:37:56,416 --> 00:37:57,916
Mom, not in the neck.

525
00:37:58,083 --> 00:38:00,583
I can not hold back,
you feel so good.

526
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:03,000
I love Swiss Army!

527
00:38:03,541 --> 00:38:06,041
Amy, it's been an eternity!

528
00:38:06,583 --> 00:38:07,958
I changed perfume.

529
00:38:08,125 --> 00:38:09,416
No ! Since when ?

530
00:38:09,583 --> 00:38:10,708
Since puberty.

531
00:38:10,875 --> 00:38:12,750
Stop and kiss me.

532
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:13,916
I already kissed you.

533
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:16,166
I know, but I still want some.

534
00:38:16,333 --> 00:38:17,541
Come here, you.

535
00:38:17,708 --> 00:38:19,166
You feel good too.

536
00:38:19,333 --> 00:38:20,416
You smell good.

537
00:38:20,583 --> 00:38:22,666
What is your perfume tonight?

538
00:38:24,208 --> 00:38:25,666
The Air of Time.

539
00:38:26,291 --> 00:38:28,000
You bought me on Canal Street?

540
00:38:28,166 --> 00:38:29,958
They sell turned perfumes.

541
00:38:30,125 --> 00:38:31,875
We do not care, no one feels it.

542
00:38:33,708 --> 00:38:35,375
My favorite aunt.

543
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,791
- Shit !
- Here, ghosts!

544
00:38:41,333 --> 00:38:42,250
Adam White?

545
00:38:42,416 --> 00:38:45,125
Do not put a spell on me!

546
00:38:50,458 --> 00:38:53,375
Watch out,
he does not like being kissed,

547
00:38:53,541 --> 00:38:54,750
or touch it.

548
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:56,250
Nice to see you, Anne.

549
00:38:56,708 --> 00:38:57,791
Me too darling.

550
00:38:57,958 --> 00:39:00,208
- You smell good !
- Thank you.

551
00:39:00,541 --> 00:39:03,291
Amy, what a beautiful coat!

552
00:39:03,458 --> 00:39:05,458
On the road to success!

553
00:39:06,791 --> 00:39:08,625
You said they were not coming.

554
00:39:08,791 --> 00:39:11,833
I bet he did it on purpose,
to get noticed.

555
00:39:12,208 --> 00:39:13,958
Who has ever seen it arrive on time?

556
00:39:14,125 --> 00:39:16,458
This is the story of his life,
and that of his father.

557
00:39:16,625 --> 00:39:18,666
I will open the wine.

558
00:39:22,833 --> 00:39:24,000
Let's go.

559
00:39:24,166 --> 00:39:26,125
Fee, fi, fo, fum,

560
00:39:26,291 --> 00:39:29,916
I smell the blood
a beef bourguignon!

561
00:39:30,083 --> 00:39:31,875
By popular demand,

562
00:39:32,041 --> 00:39:34,416
Ina Garten's recipe
beef bourguignon

563
00:39:35,166 --> 00:39:36,166
revisited by Grace.

564
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:41,041
John does not eat it,
it's not smart enough for him anymore.

565
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,375
But the others, serve you,

566
00:39:43,541 --> 00:39:46,375
I bring the gratin
potatoes.

567
00:39:46,541 --> 00:39:48,375
And I warm you up a little thing.

568
00:39:48,541 --> 00:39:50,958
I told you to do nothing special.

569
00:39:51,125 --> 00:39:53,208
Do not worry, it's nothing at all.

570
00:39:53,375 --> 00:39:56,458
Just spaghetti bolognese,
with broccoli

571
00:39:56,625 --> 00:39:58,166
and bacon.

572
00:39:58,333 --> 00:40:00,666
I made you
when you played hockey.

573
00:40:01,708 --> 00:40:05,000
Faith? You can tell me
if you have to add salt?

574
00:40:05,166 --> 00:40:06,916
I never get dirty enough

575
00:40:07,083 --> 00:40:10,291
I passed the stadium
from your college the other day.

576
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,291
And I was asking myself...

577
00:40:12,458 --> 00:40:14,833
You still think of hockey,
you have regrets?

578
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Excellent question. Let's examine it.

579
00:40:17,166 --> 00:40:19,500
You regret
to become rich and famous?

580
00:40:19,666 --> 00:40:20,958
I imagine so, yes.

581
00:40:21,125 --> 00:40:23,625
Yes, while you could
have a head trauma.

582
00:40:23,791 --> 00:40:26,333
Pat, we've told you a hundred times,
he hurt himself.

583
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:30,500
You were a great player.
You have a nature of sportsman.

584
00:40:30,666 --> 00:40:32,791
I did not say anything, mom.

585
00:40:32,958 --> 00:40:33,875
Faith?

586
00:40:34,625 --> 00:40:35,916
You need salt.

587
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:38,916
- Just a little bit.
- I was sure of it.

588
00:40:39,083 --> 00:40:41,125
Still need some wine?

589
00:40:41,291 --> 00:40:43,458
It's okay ? No, I'll go get some.

590
00:40:43,625 --> 00:40:45,583
So, the big news?

591
00:40:46,125 --> 00:40:48,875
You will make me miss my sauce.

592
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:52,000
It's not official ...

593
00:40:52,166 --> 00:40:53,541
He will play Jack Harvest.

594
00:40:54,125 --> 00:40:55,041
Jimmy, shit.

595
00:40:55,208 --> 00:40:56,333
Who's interested?

596
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,666
The whole earth.

597
00:40:58,833 --> 00:41:00,666
It brings bad luck to say it.

598
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:02,791
No, damn,
Assure you like a beast!

599
00:41:02,958 --> 00:41:04,791
Jack Harvest, who is it?

600
00:41:04,958 --> 00:41:07,500
I bet
that he is a famous democrat,

601
00:41:07,666 --> 00:41:09,750
they make a documentary
on his life.

602
00:41:09,916 --> 00:41:12,000
It's a comic character,

603
00:41:12,166 --> 00:41:13,750
a kind of superhero.

604
00:41:13,916 --> 00:41:15,000
I see.

605
00:41:15,166 --> 00:41:16,625
It's amazing !

606
00:41:16,791 --> 00:41:19,250
These films work well
right now, no?

607
00:41:19,416 --> 00:41:21,500
But it will not last, if?

608
00:41:22,083 --> 00:41:23,500
And it's going well?

609
00:41:23,666 --> 00:41:26,000
Nothing's happening.
I do not have the role yet.

610
00:41:26,166 --> 00:41:28,333
- The director adores you.
- He chose me.

611
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:31,708
The studio will surely agree.

612
00:41:31,875 --> 00:41:34,166
- We wait...
- The whole earth, serious.

613
00:41:34,708 --> 00:41:36,291
They will negotiate.

614
00:41:37,458 --> 00:41:38,375
Nothing is done.

615
00:41:38,541 --> 00:41:41,041
You will have it,
it's folded, it's good.

616
00:41:43,458 --> 00:41:45,666
I missed the sauce,
it's too liquid.

617
00:41:45,833 --> 00:41:46,708
But it is good.

618
00:41:56,458 --> 00:41:59,500
Don did not know
that Sissy's lover

619
00:41:59,666 --> 00:42:01,333
was hidden in the closet.

620
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,166
He returns early, inflated to the block,

621
00:42:04,333 --> 00:42:06,333
to the idea of ​​going skiing.

622
00:42:06,916 --> 00:42:10,541
He opens the closet door
to take his things

623
00:42:10,958 --> 00:42:12,833
and go skiing.

624
00:42:14,708 --> 00:42:18,250
Sissy still remembers
of the head he made.

625
00:42:18,416 --> 00:42:21,583
And his boyfriend
left in slalom.

626
00:42:22,625 --> 00:42:23,750
The cow !

627
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:27,375
It reminds me
when you got your husband bastard

628
00:42:27,541 --> 00:42:29,291
in the cabin with this girl.

629
00:42:29,458 --> 00:42:31,416
I never trusted him,

630
00:42:31,583 --> 00:42:34,791
but then I thought
that I was really right.

631
00:42:36,291 --> 00:42:37,791
That's crazy.

632
00:42:38,791 --> 00:42:40,958
I'm going to drink a little water.

633
00:42:42,666 --> 00:42:43,958
Good idea.

634
00:42:44,125 --> 00:42:45,541
Mom, if you let go of Jimmy

635
00:42:45,708 --> 00:42:48,291
and that you helped Aunt Faith
to bring water?

636
00:42:49,083 --> 00:42:51,708
Jonathan, do not take me high.

637
00:42:51,875 --> 00:42:55,625
I do not take you high, Grace.

638
00:42:56,416 --> 00:42:57,416
Yes.

639
00:42:57,583 --> 00:42:58,625
Who wants water?

640
00:42:58,791 --> 00:43:00,500
Some water ? Do you believe in church?

641
00:43:01,333 --> 00:43:02,583
Anne, a glass of water?

642
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:03,708
Yes thanks.

643
00:43:04,833 --> 00:43:07,250
You may be the only one
to want to drink.

644
00:43:07,416 --> 00:43:08,958
I think we've been drinking enough.

645
00:43:09,125 --> 00:43:10,500
We are adults.

646
00:43:10,666 --> 00:43:12,041
OK so...

647
00:43:13,458 --> 00:43:16,875
everyone wants whiskey,
except Anne and John.

648
00:43:17,041 --> 00:43:18,666
No. And Amy.

649
00:43:19,125 --> 00:43:19,958
No.

650
00:43:21,416 --> 00:43:24,000
It's better that you do not drink,
with your treatment.

651
00:43:26,791 --> 00:43:27,750
Malin.

652
00:43:27,916 --> 00:43:29,000
We will stop there.

653
00:43:29,166 --> 00:43:30,583
Why ?

654
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:32,583
There is whiskey, Jimmy.

655
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:34,625
Thank you for the support, Patrick.

656
00:43:34,791 --> 00:43:35,708
I fuck you!

657
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,750
I have an idea !
Why do not you stay sleepy?

658
00:43:39,916 --> 00:43:42,875
I have cinnamon rolls
at the freezer for tomorrow.

659
00:43:44,458 --> 00:43:46,333
I think we'll go there.

660
00:43:51,625 --> 00:43:53,500
It's a hotel evening?

661
00:43:55,166 --> 00:43:56,333
You know, Pat,

662
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:59,375
John loves going to the hotel,
sometimes.

663
00:43:59,541 --> 00:44:01,500
You do not come
to buy an apartment

664
00:44:01,666 --> 00:44:02,875
to a billion dollars?

665
00:44:03,041 --> 00:44:07,375
If, but you know, sometimes,
he needs tranquility.

666
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,375
To do what ?

667
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:14,125
Attention, Amy.

668
00:44:14,625 --> 00:44:16,791
Like father, like son.

669
00:44:16,958 --> 00:44:18,083
That's enough, mom.

670
00:44:18,875 --> 00:44:20,833
Grace, I'll go there.

671
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:25,291
Can you pay attention to people?
To your sister, to Jimmy,

672
00:44:25,458 --> 00:44:26,291
to me.

673
00:44:26,458 --> 00:44:28,041
At all but this shitty whiskey!

674
00:44:28,208 --> 00:44:30,333
I am not a kid!

675
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:34,916
I spend my life
to give you my attention.

676
00:44:35,333 --> 00:44:38,333
Apart from you, everyone
love my beef bourguignon.

677
00:44:38,875 --> 00:44:41,583
Everyone loves my coffee.

678
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:45,625
So, stop doing your snobbish
and sit down.

679
00:44:47,166 --> 00:44:48,458
You are ridiculing yourself.

680
00:44:48,625 --> 00:44:50,333
Good, gently.

681
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,208
Relax, Brad Pitt.

682
00:44:52,375 --> 00:44:53,458
Shut your mouth !

683
00:44:54,166 --> 00:44:56,291
It's you who will shut your mouth!

684
00:44:56,458 --> 00:44:59,083
Good God,
how do you talk to your elders?

685
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:01,166
You're not telling me to shut up,

686
00:45:01,333 --> 00:45:03,791
and you do not talk to your mother
on that tone.

687
00:45:03,958 --> 00:45:06,166
After what you did to him.

688
00:45:06,333 --> 00:45:09,875
Stamps, bills,
doctors, psys,

689
00:45:10,041 --> 00:45:11,791
fights at school.

690
00:45:11,958 --> 00:45:13,916
You and your shit hockey,

691
00:45:14,083 --> 00:45:15,875
not to mention your filthy father.

692
00:45:16,041 --> 00:45:17,000
Shut up !

693
00:45:34,625 --> 00:45:37,958
<i> It's not my style
to believe in synchronicity, </ i>

694
00:45:38,125 --> 00:45:41,750

695
00:45:41,916 --> 00:45:42,750

700
00:45:57,541 --> 00:46:00,416

701
00:46:00,583 --> 00:46:02,666
<i> I did not know everything about John's life </ i>

702
00:46:02,833 --> 00:46:07,041

so dramatically. </ i>

704
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:14,875
Damn, this is the keum
of the series that tears!

705
00:49:34,875 --> 00:49:36,833
Oh my God !

706
00:49:43,666 --> 00:49:44,625
A latte coffee?

707
00:49:46,041 --> 00:49:47,666
My heart will explode.

708
00:49:48,833 --> 00:49:50,333
No, I promise you.

709
00:49:52,583 --> 00:49:53,625
Thank you.

710
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:04,583
You do not recognize me, actually?

711
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:09,791
It was a long time ago.
Before last summer.

712
00:50:11,041 --> 00:50:12,000
Long before.

713
00:50:14,708 --> 00:50:18,750
I'm from Pleasant Gap.

714
00:50:20,958 --> 00:50:23,125
Near the University Park campus.

715
00:50:25,333 --> 00:50:26,291
You kidding ?

716
00:50:26,458 --> 00:50:27,875
It was your college, right?

717
00:50:28,458 --> 00:50:31,291
You played with the Raging Badgers.

718
00:50:36,666 --> 00:50:40,458
I followed your exploits.

719
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,708
I was reading stuff about you
in the newspapers.

720
00:50:43,875 --> 00:50:45,583
Until you explode.

721
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:49,583
In fact, it's a bit like you
which made me want to be an actor.

722
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:52,791
I broke with my boyfriend.
Finally, my ex, now.

723
00:50:53,541 --> 00:50:54,958
It went wrong.

724
00:50:59,041 --> 00:51:01,708
I did not think I would see you again one day.

725
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:04,125
It's funny.

726
00:51:04,916 --> 00:51:06,541
Yeah, it's funny.

727
00:51:14,416 --> 00:51:16,041
Why did not you tell me?

728
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,166
I do not know, I thought ...

729
00:51:20,541 --> 00:51:22,541
I dunno...

730
00:51:22,708 --> 00:51:24,083
That you had forgotten me

731
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:26,125
or that you would like
I forgot you.

732
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:27,375
I dunno.

733
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,250
How are you, mother?

734
00:51:30,375 --> 00:51:31,708
She came to see you play.

735
00:51:31,875 --> 00:51:33,791
She was laughing really good.

736
00:51:33,958 --> 00:51:35,333
It was funny.

737
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:36,500
She is fine.

738
00:51:36,666 --> 00:51:38,916
And your brother ? Jimmy, right?

739
00:51:39,875 --> 00:51:40,833
Jimmy?

740
00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:45,500
I can not.

741
00:51:45,916 --> 00:51:48,458
I can not continue there.

742
00:51:55,375 --> 00:51:56,625
Listen, Will ...

743
00:51:57,958 --> 00:51:59,708
You're nice, but ...

744
00:52:01,458 --> 00:52:03,125
You're really nice, but ...

745
00:52:04,833 --> 00:52:06,000
I can not.

746
00:52:10,125 --> 00:52:13,208
It's not good, it's going to end badly.

747
00:52:15,666 --> 00:52:17,583
I can not afford it.

748
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:29,291
You're adorable.

749
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:30,791
You too.

750
00:52:31,333 --> 00:52:32,791
You're nice, but ...

751
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:51,208
Thanks for the coffee.

752
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,166
<i> I did not understand his rules,
but now it's clear. </ i>

753
00:53:20,333 --> 00:53:24,166
<i> How can we live
constantly in the lie? </ i>

754
00:53:24,333 --> 00:53:26,041
You have to escape.

755
00:53:26,708 --> 00:53:28,416
A moment comes when the mask

756
00:53:29,750 --> 00:53:31,333
is cracking, right?

757
00:53:35,208 --> 00:53:37,708
I'm sorry, Mr. Turner ...

758
00:53:37,875 --> 00:53:41,000
I'm coming back from Islamabad.
I will be in Nigeria in eight days.

759
00:53:41,166 --> 00:53:43,791
All this conversation seems to me

760
00:53:44,458 --> 00:53:46,708
very far from my world.

761
00:53:46,875 --> 00:53:48,916
It's hard to bear?

762
00:53:49,083 --> 00:53:51,208
Yes, very hard.

763
00:53:51,375 --> 00:53:54,333
I am...
How to say it nicely?

764
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,708
I have a lot of respect for you,
sincerely,

765
00:53:56,875 --> 00:54:00,666
and I would like so much
to feel sorry for Mr. Donovan.

766
00:54:00,833 --> 00:54:05,416
I find that these are
small problems of the rich.

767
00:54:05,583 --> 00:54:07,291
What are you doing in Prague?

768
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:11,916
I live here and in London.

769
00:54:12,083 --> 00:54:14,333
No, sorry, I meant ...
Where are you from ?

770
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:18,291
You're not coming
Congo, the DRC?

771
00:54:20,041 --> 00:54:21,458
I think I read that yesterday.

772
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:24,166
It's hard to know
who is interviewing who.

773
00:54:24,333 --> 00:54:26,625
I was born in Bukavu.
But we move away from the subject.

774
00:54:26,791 --> 00:54:28,291
No, we stop the pipe.

775
00:54:28,458 --> 00:54:31,250
You think we do not come
of the same planet?

776
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,125
It's wrong.

777
00:54:33,291 --> 00:54:35,875
Why would you fight
for the truth,

778
00:54:36,791 --> 00:54:39,291
and me, what to slab?

779
00:54:39,458 --> 00:54:40,708
I see that you have taken it badly.

780
00:54:40,875 --> 00:54:43,250
You believe that stories
do not travel?

781
00:54:44,875 --> 00:54:46,208
The story of a kid.

782
00:54:46,375 --> 00:54:48,083
You are no longer a kid ...

783
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:50,583
So, do not treat me
like a child.

784
00:54:50,750 --> 00:54:53,625
Its a story
who tells the intolerance

785
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:56,708
an industry
so scared of losing an audience

786
00:54:56,875 --> 00:54:59,291
that she considers ignorant and obtuse,

787
00:54:59,458 --> 00:55:02,166
that she keeps him in this state
for decades.

788
00:55:02,333 --> 00:55:04,041
It's about us

789
00:55:05,583 --> 00:55:07,500
What society do we want?

790
00:55:07,666 --> 00:55:11,666
What do we aspire to?
In what way is it abstract or unworthy?

791
00:55:11,833 --> 00:55:13,416
I did not want to annoy you.

792
00:55:13,875 --> 00:55:16,041
No, you risk
your life for the truth,

793
00:55:16,208 --> 00:55:19,375
and we, we play it
with our rich problems.

794
00:55:20,083 --> 00:55:23,916
The idea that being privileged
determines what can be said,

795
00:55:24,083 --> 00:55:26,708
and that you have to have a rotten life
to be able to sympathize,

796
00:55:27,208 --> 00:55:28,875
it's a plague, damn!

797
00:55:29,583 --> 00:55:31,375
Me, I come from there.

798
00:55:31,541 --> 00:55:32,666
Right here.

799
00:55:33,875 --> 00:55:35,791
You and me,
we want to change things,

800
00:55:36,208 --> 00:55:38,458
to have an impact
about people's fears,

801
00:55:38,625 --> 00:55:40,791
ignorance, sectarianism,

802
00:55:41,791 --> 00:55:43,541
sexism, racism,
homophobia, etc.

803
00:55:43,708 --> 00:55:46,750
You thought you had
the monopoly of these fights?

804
00:56:37,250 --> 00:56:38,541
Where were we now?

805
00:56:44,333 --> 00:56:45,833
Where were we now?

806
00:56:56,291 --> 00:56:57,666
So...

807
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:03,500
Go ahead, Rupert. We are all ears.

808
00:57:05,166 --> 00:57:08,875
I started to document myself
about John F. Donovan five years ago.

809
00:57:09,041 --> 00:57:12,833
And I discovered we had
a lot of things in common.

810
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:13,833
For example,

811
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,375
the fact that we have relationships
complicated with our fathers,

812
00:57:17,541 --> 00:57:19,875
and that we dreamed
to be an actor from childhood.

813
00:57:20,041 --> 00:57:21,583
I wrote him a letter.

814
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:24,125
I was crazy to think
that he would answer me,

815
00:57:24,291 --> 00:57:25,416
but he did it.

816
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:30,958
Because you are
both homos.

817
00:57:32,916 --> 00:57:34,833
Cedric, second warning.

818
00:57:35,833 --> 00:57:36,791
He has answered.

819
00:57:36,958 --> 00:57:39,875
And that's the object
which I chose to speak.

820
00:57:40,916 --> 00:57:42,250
For almost six years,

821
00:57:42,416 --> 00:57:44,791
John F. Donovan and I,
we write ourselves

822
00:57:44,958 --> 00:57:46,708
once or twice a month.

823
00:57:46,875 --> 00:57:50,500
He tells me everything
on his shoots, on the 7th art,

824
00:57:50,666 --> 00:57:52,333
and explain to me its complexity.

825
00:57:53,333 --> 00:57:56,708
He tells his previews,
his "press junkets" ...

826
00:57:56,875 --> 00:58:00,250
It's a press conference
with lots of journalists.

827
00:58:00,416 --> 00:58:01,958
How did he know his wife Amy,

828
00:58:02,125 --> 00:58:03,875
his difficulties with his mother,

829
00:58:04,041 --> 00:58:06,291
and what she thinks of her career.

830
00:58:06,833 --> 00:58:09,333
But it was before
that he is really famous.

831
00:58:10,083 --> 00:58:12,333
He never stopped writing.

832
00:58:12,708 --> 00:58:14,333
I'm only 11,

833
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:18,125
but later, I'll be like him
and we will shoot together.

834
00:58:18,291 --> 00:58:20,333
John, whom I prefer to call "J",

835
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,791
often quotes Gore Vidal,
great author, critic and essayist.

836
00:58:25,333 --> 00:58:27,833
"Style is knowing who we are."

837
00:58:28,708 --> 00:58:31,958
John knows perfectly who he is

838
00:58:32,125 --> 00:58:33,958
and I know who I am.

839
00:58:34,125 --> 00:58:35,291
I'm an actor,

840
00:58:35,791 --> 00:58:37,916
and I am John F. Donovan's friend.

841
00:58:41,208 --> 00:58:42,375
Big bobbins.

842
00:58:44,291 --> 00:58:46,166
That's enough. You leave.

843
00:58:46,333 --> 00:58:48,833
Madam, recognize him,

844
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,750
it's big shit.

845
00:58:50,916 --> 00:58:52,583
It's not dumb, duck.

846
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:55,750
Stop this profanity!

847
00:58:55,916 --> 00:58:57,958
Kind of little liar.

848
00:58:58,125 --> 00:59:00,875
I have his letters here, con head.
You're just jealous.

849
00:59:01,041 --> 00:59:02,833
Shut up, bitch.

850
00:59:04,375 --> 00:59:06,250
Outside, fast.

851
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:09,833
In fact, I think she tells you
to fuck you!

852
00:59:13,666 --> 00:59:15,625
Rupert, you stay here.

853
00:59:15,791 --> 00:59:17,541
Cedric, I'll punish you tomorrow.

854
00:59:17,708 --> 00:59:20,250
I will not tolerate
Incivility in my class.

855
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:24,375
Come on!

856
00:59:29,416 --> 00:59:30,666
We activate.

857
00:59:41,583 --> 00:59:44,041
Rupert, approach. Come.

858
00:59:53,708 --> 00:59:56,333
You know, I'll put you
a bad grade.

859
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:58,625
- It was not good?
- Yes, excellent.

860
00:59:58,791 --> 01:00:01,666
It would have been perfect
for your September writing.

861
01:00:01,833 --> 01:00:03,916
You have a real talent for writing.

862
01:00:04,083 --> 01:00:07,916
But I was very clear
as to the criteria of the exercise.

863
01:00:08,083 --> 01:00:10,541
- A true story.
- John is real.

864
01:00:10,708 --> 01:00:12,458
Yes, you're right.

865
01:00:13,125 --> 01:00:14,833
But you invented this story.

866
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,500
Not at all.

867
01:00:16,666 --> 01:00:18,791
You know that I appreciate your creativity.

868
01:00:18,958 --> 01:00:21,083
Mrs. Kureishi, that's right!

869
01:00:21,708 --> 01:00:23,083
- Rupert.
- I swear !

870
01:00:23,250 --> 01:00:24,625
I have the letters,

871
01:00:24,791 --> 01:00:27,583
but it sounded
and I could not show them.

872
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:29,791
I can see them ?

873
01:00:44,875 --> 01:00:46,000
So ?

874
01:00:47,458 --> 01:00:48,541
Shit.

875
01:00:55,333 --> 01:00:58,541
Too good, the letters!
Thank you so much.

876
01:00:58,958 --> 01:01:00,208
Magnificent !

877
01:01:16,833 --> 01:01:19,041
Dad, are you listening to me, or not?

878
01:01:19,708 --> 01:01:20,875
A moment.

879
01:01:23,833 --> 01:01:24,708
Dad !

880
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:53,375
Jesus, Mary, Joseph!

881
01:01:53,541 --> 01:01:54,833
Who are you ?

882
01:01:58,500 --> 01:01:59,708
Hi, Phil!

883
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:02,791
How is it going ?
Have you had a good weekend?

884
01:02:02,958 --> 01:02:04,250
- Yeah!
- Yeah?

885
01:02:04,416 --> 01:02:05,500
Gil, how are you?

886
01:02:05,666 --> 01:02:06,791
Happy to see you.

887
01:02:14,541 --> 01:02:16,041
I think we're done.

888
01:02:16,208 --> 01:02:17,458
<i> Okay, perfect. </ i>

889
01:02:22,125 --> 01:02:23,583
I do not know what's going on.

890
01:02:23,750 --> 01:02:25,958
They would have met
in a bar.

891
01:02:26,125 --> 01:02:27,875
It's been months
that they are together.

892
01:02:28,041 --> 01:02:28,875
What?

893
01:02:29,041 --> 01:02:30,541
- It's been a long time.
- My God !

894
01:02:30,708 --> 01:02:33,541
You met him! It's blond
who came on the set.

895
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:36,000
It seems
that there is an article online.

896
01:02:36,166 --> 01:02:38,458
- Ah yes ?
- Yes, I have not read it yet ...

897
01:02:39,833 --> 01:02:40,916
That's it, Johnny.

898
01:02:55,458 --> 01:02:58,500
"I am happy.
It's really a great role. "

899
01:02:59,041 --> 01:03:01,750
You do not have the right
to read the letters.

900
01:03:02,375 --> 01:03:03,875
Do not worry, buddy.

901
01:03:04,041 --> 01:03:06,291
We will respect your privacy.

902
01:03:06,833 --> 01:03:09,416
And my fundamental rights. Thank you.

903
01:03:10,541 --> 01:03:12,416
Do you want us to pack them?

904
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:17,541
Sorry sir...

905
01:03:18,791 --> 01:03:21,541
My son was arrested?

906
01:03:29,125 --> 01:03:31,000
Liz, can I talk to you for a second?

907
01:03:31,166 --> 01:03:33,000
I go to the canteen.

908
01:03:33,166 --> 01:03:34,958
Yes, the thing is that ...

909
01:03:35,125 --> 01:03:37,416
Me too, I need a coffee. Come.

910
01:03:43,041 --> 01:03:44,375
What's going on there?

911
01:03:46,958 --> 01:03:48,125
What?

912
01:03:48,875 --> 01:03:50,958
It must be spam.

913
01:03:51,416 --> 01:03:56,125
Besides, you were not
with Will Jefford Jr, this weekend.

914
01:03:59,875 --> 01:04:01,083
Yes ?

915
01:04:20,875 --> 01:04:25,083
You managed to disappoint me so much
in one evening

916
01:04:25,541 --> 01:04:27,791
that it forces admiration,
Rupert Turner.

917
01:04:27,958 --> 01:04:29,083
I am bluffing.

918
01:04:40,208 --> 01:04:42,166
You lie to your teachers.

919
01:04:42,916 --> 01:04:46,416
You make me leave my job
to come to the police station

920
01:04:46,583 --> 01:04:49,458
after you have been arrested
in the act of breaking and entering.

921
01:04:49,625 --> 01:04:51,458
How are you, Rupert?

922
01:04:52,083 --> 01:04:53,000
Sorry mom.

923
01:04:53,166 --> 01:04:55,166
No, it's too easy.

924
01:04:55,333 --> 01:04:57,375
I want an explanation
right now.

925
01:04:57,875 --> 01:05:01,000
I have a correspondence
with John F. Donovan.

926
01:05:01,166 --> 01:05:03,458
The actor of the series?

927
01:05:03,625 --> 01:05:06,916
Yes, I have been writing to him for five years.

928
01:05:07,416 --> 01:05:11,208
He answered the first letter,
the one we wrote together.

929
01:05:11,375 --> 01:05:13,500
- He has answered ?
- Yes.

930
01:05:15,541 --> 01:05:17,333
You never told me!

931
01:05:18,208 --> 01:05:19,541
What was he writing to you?

932
01:05:19,708 --> 01:05:23,291
Nothing, stuff about movies,
his family and his friends.

933
01:05:23,458 --> 01:05:26,541
His game.

934
01:05:27,083 --> 01:05:29,666
- How many letters?
- A lot.

935
01:05:29,833 --> 01:05:32,041
That is to say ? 5, 10, 20, how much?

936
01:05:32,541 --> 01:05:33,625
About a hundred.

937
01:05:33,791 --> 01:05:36,583
What? Damn, it's not true!

938
01:05:36,750 --> 01:05:40,083
What's the matter with you ?
Do you hate me so much?

939
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:51,916
Why you lied to me ?

940
01:05:52,083 --> 01:05:53,583
- I never lied.
- Stopped.

941
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:55,416
You're a liar, like your father.

942
01:05:55,583 --> 01:05:57,125
I said nothing, that's all.

943
01:05:57,291 --> 01:06:00,208
Sorry for my lack
vocabulary.

944
01:06:00,375 --> 01:06:03,500
You have been lying for years.

945
01:06:03,666 --> 01:06:07,125
I refuse to be treated
as a stranger, I am your mother.

946
01:06:07,291 --> 01:06:08,416
You're sure ?

947
01:06:08,833 --> 01:06:10,291
You never asked me anything.

948
01:06:10,458 --> 01:06:14,250
You never ask me anything
on my game or my auditions.

949
01:06:14,416 --> 01:06:17,500
Stop your bullshit, that's shame.

950
01:06:17,666 --> 01:06:20,583
It's the shame we left
America to come here.

951
01:06:20,750 --> 01:06:22,166
Why ? For who ?

952
01:06:22,583 --> 01:06:24,708
Dad does not even have time
to see me.

953
01:06:24,875 --> 01:06:27,666
So, what's the point
to be in England?

954
01:06:27,833 --> 01:06:31,291
Other than lying to yourself
on your new super life

955
01:06:31,458 --> 01:06:36,375
that you impose me far from my friends,
of my life, and of my college.

956
01:06:36,541 --> 01:06:39,875
Because you noticed
that you had missed everything.

957
01:06:40,041 --> 01:06:42,250
So, no,
I never talked about letters

958
01:06:42,416 --> 01:06:45,458
because you would surely have freaked
and you would have forbidden me

959
01:06:45,625 --> 01:06:49,958
to write to the only person
who seems to be interested in me

960
01:06:50,125 --> 01:06:54,625
in this rotten life
from a banality to crying,

961
01:06:54,791 --> 01:06:56,791
and that I can not wait to leave.

962
01:06:56,958 --> 01:07:00,250
Far from you, far from this apartment,

963
01:07:00,416 --> 01:07:03,791
far from your little dreams
and your mediocrity.

964
01:07:07,916 --> 01:07:10,083
You can say goodbye
at your audition in London.

965
01:07:10,250 --> 01:07:12,000
What a surprise!

966
01:07:12,166 --> 01:07:13,708
I must miss everything, like you.

967
01:07:13,875 --> 01:07:16,083
Rupert, shut up!

968
01:07:23,625 --> 01:07:25,625
It is surely Scotland Yard.

969
01:07:29,166 --> 01:07:32,375
Since when did your son
written to John F. Donovan?

970
01:07:33,208 --> 01:07:36,750
He writes often? What is he writing?

971
01:07:41,083 --> 01:07:42,125
Shit !

972
01:07:44,250 --> 01:07:48,291
Tom, it's happening
a very weird story in Harrow.

973
01:07:48,458 --> 01:07:51,875
How a TV star
and an 11 year old

974
01:07:52,041 --> 01:07:54,958
are involved in an incident
forcing the police to intervene?

975
01:07:55,125 --> 01:07:57,041
Can you enlighten us?

976
01:07:57,541 --> 01:08:01,250
Are you sure of the age, Mike?
11 years is bullshit.

977
01:08:01,416 --> 01:08:04,708
Go ahead, Rhys.
It was Richard who wrote it.

978
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:07,750
The cow ! It's bothering me a corner.

979
01:08:07,916 --> 01:08:10,333
I'm 18, I have needs,
I need you.

980
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:12,041
I have visions all the time.

981
01:08:12,208 --> 01:08:14,291
The ones you had
when I healed you?

982
01:08:14,458 --> 01:08:16,916
Sarah ... That's normal.

983
01:08:17,833 --> 01:08:20,000
When I saved you,
our souls have bonded,

984
01:08:20,166 --> 01:08:21,541
I do not know why...

985
01:08:22,208 --> 01:08:23,458
Shit !

986
01:08:23,625 --> 01:08:24,500
What?

987
01:08:24,666 --> 01:08:27,083
You had a busy weekend, Johnny!

988
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,250
Are you all right, huh?

989
01:08:31,416 --> 01:08:32,458
Yeah.

990
01:08:33,375 --> 01:08:35,083
- Billy!
- What's up mate ?

991
01:08:36,375 --> 01:08:37,875
We repeat.

992
01:08:38,833 --> 01:08:40,666
Sorry, Miss Jones.

993
01:08:41,333 --> 01:08:43,750
This guy is really a jerk.

994
01:08:45,083 --> 01:08:46,708
Adam. And Diego?

995
01:08:47,083 --> 01:08:49,208
He asks questions.
He is aware.

996
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:52,583
We'll send Bella to visit her dreams
and erase his memory.

997
01:08:52,750 --> 01:08:54,916
Whore ! Will not it stop?

998
01:08:55,541 --> 01:08:56,833
Are we going to see the doctor on the set?

999
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,500
Let's go to the hosto, it will be discreet.

1000
01:09:01,708 --> 01:09:02,958
You wrote these letters?

1001
01:09:03,125 --> 01:09:05,083
- Speak louder.
- Sorry.

1002
01:09:05,250 --> 01:09:08,166
What's this,
this story of letters?

1003
01:09:08,333 --> 01:09:09,291
Which letters?

1004
01:09:09,458 --> 01:09:11,666
Do you write letters to a kid?

1005
01:09:12,166 --> 01:09:13,166
It's cute...

1006
01:09:18,583 --> 01:09:20,416
Repeat, we have time.

1007
01:09:20,583 --> 01:09:22,541
They make the settings.
You have 20 minutes ...

1008
01:09:22,708 --> 01:09:24,166
Thank you.

1009
01:09:24,541 --> 01:09:26,708

this weekend, asshole?

You think
I want to tell you?

Come on, Brian.
Johnny is farting a cable. Shut up.

1053

No, we are not friends!

We are not friends, damn!

but you do not know who I am.

You know neither my life nor my past,
neither my secrets, damn!

And I have to tell you my weekend

01:12:20,916 --> 01:12:23,166
because if not,
you'll go tell

1060
01:12:23,333 --> 01:12:26,583
that I am a pretentious asshole.

1061
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:32,041
"He's like us, that asshole,
he shits every morning! "

1062
01:12:32,666 --> 01:12:36,333
That's right, Billy.
Obviously he's shitting.

1063
01:12:36,916 --> 01:12:39,375
And he is so grateful,
so nice,

1064
01:12:39,541 --> 01:12:42,208
and most of all, he is so happy

1065
01:12:42,875 --> 01:12:46,875
that he will tell you everything
on his fucking weekend!

1066
01:13:02,583 --> 01:13:03,916
Shit !

1067
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:06,333

hear the question.

Yes, it was not great.

1086
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:03,250
And then, he wrote
to apologize, or explain?

1087
01:15:03,416 --> 01:15:04,458
Yes of course.

1088
01:15:04,625 --> 01:15:08,375
But he ignored me,
it was not the most painful.

1089
01:15:08,541 --> 01:15:11,166
I understood
he had no choice.

1090
01:15:11,333 --> 01:15:12,958
Even if it was painful.

1091
01:15:13,541 --> 01:15:16,833
But the consequences,

1092
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:20,458
with the boys and my teacher,
were going to be horrible.

1093
01:15:25,916 --> 01:15:27,708
Are you going to miss your plane?

1094
01:15:28,291 --> 01:15:30,500
We can finish by mail
if you prefer.

1095
01:15:30,666 --> 01:15:33,250
No, do not worry. It's okay.

1096
01:15:33,416 --> 01:15:36,500
How much do I owe you
for that smile?

1097
01:15:36,666 --> 01:15:38,416
- I piss you off.
- Call an ambulance.

1098
01:15:38,583 --> 01:15:42,166
Sorry, excuse me.
Is there a doctor on the plane?

1099
01:15:42,791 --> 01:15:45,875
This behavior is unusual,
maybe a stroke start.

1100
01:15:46,041 --> 01:15:47,625
Audrey, does it smell like burnt?

1101
01:15:48,458 --> 01:15:49,750
It's okay ?

1102
01:15:52,791 --> 01:15:55,166
- Go to work.
- At work.

1103
01:15:56,291 --> 01:15:58,000
What happened next ?

1104
01:16:19,208 --> 01:16:22,708
You go to the retirement home,
today.

1105
01:16:23,666 --> 01:16:28,000
And I read in your agenda
that you have to wear the uniform.

1106
01:16:31,208 --> 01:16:32,791
So, I'll help you.

1107
01:16:50,791 --> 01:16:52,458
It's gonna be fun.

1108
01:16:55,083 --> 01:16:57,000
Nice and healthy.

1109
01:16:57,166 --> 01:16:59,708
You will do a good action

1110
01:16:59,875 --> 01:17:04,500
and it will change you a little
of all this madness.

1111
01:17:04,666 --> 01:17:05,916
Your feet.

1112
01:17:08,250 --> 01:17:10,583
He said he had not
write the letters.

1113
01:17:11,875 --> 01:17:13,416
They will smash me.

1114
01:17:13,583 --> 01:17:15,666
Everyone will make fun of me.

1115
01:17:16,708 --> 01:17:18,625
I want to stay here with you.

1116
01:17:19,375 --> 01:17:21,291
Please do not do this to me.

1117
01:17:21,666 --> 01:17:23,166
Do not let me down.

1118
01:17:23,333 --> 01:17:26,041
You will never write to this man again.

1119
01:17:26,208 --> 01:17:28,708
It's understood ?
Whether true or not ...

1120
01:17:28,875 --> 01:17:30,333
It is true.

1121
01:17:31,541 --> 01:17:33,250
Do you see what he's doing to you?

1122
01:17:33,750 --> 01:17:37,125
He let you go without hesitation
and he will do it again if necessary.

1123
01:17:38,208 --> 01:17:41,500
It always happens like that
in this place.

1124
01:17:42,541 --> 01:17:44,916
I know you love this job.

1125
01:17:45,791 --> 01:17:48,208
But we have to go back down to earth.

1126
01:17:50,291 --> 01:17:51,958
Think about your notes.

1127
01:17:52,375 --> 01:17:54,958
You can have a girlfriend,
or a friend.

1128
01:17:57,291 --> 01:17:59,458
You must forget all that.

1129
01:18:02,375 --> 01:18:05,166
Today's hearing
could change everything.

1130
01:18:05,583 --> 01:18:08,083
For once,
it was an American movie.

1131
01:18:09,583 --> 01:18:13,500
You will audition
at the end of the year, this summer.

1132
01:18:13,666 --> 01:18:16,958
If you disappear a moment,
you never come back.

1133
01:18:20,458 --> 01:18:21,708
Like you.

1134
01:18:27,375 --> 01:18:28,500
It is true.

1135
01:18:30,208 --> 01:18:32,041
It would be great

1136
01:18:32,208 --> 01:18:35,166
if you did not remind me all the time.

1137
01:18:37,166 --> 01:18:40,625
I know you think
that I have no ambition,

1138
01:18:40,791 --> 01:18:42,750
and that I am not strong.

1139
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,500
You're happy ?

1140
01:18:47,625 --> 01:18:51,541
But if a kid
mocks you or hurts you,

1141
01:18:51,708 --> 01:18:54,458
or if an adult ridicules you,

1142
01:18:54,625 --> 01:18:55,916
me,

1143
01:18:56,083 --> 01:19:00,125
I will be the rabat-joy
service, tiny,

1144
01:19:00,291 --> 01:19:02,583
who will come to protect you, okay?

1145
01:19:03,541 --> 01:19:07,958
I was never afraid to miss
my career or losing your father.

1146
01:19:08,458 --> 01:19:12,333
But I will always be afraid
to hurt you.

1147
01:19:15,875 --> 01:19:18,458
Not today, not tomorrow,

1148
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:23,625
surely not before very long,

1149
01:19:24,166 --> 01:19:25,500
but one day,

1150
01:19:26,625 --> 01:19:28,375
you will understand.

1151
01:19:50,083 --> 01:19:52,250
Hi, Olga. Hello, Catherine. </ I>

1152
01:19:52,416 --> 01:19:54,666
Timothy, Rodrigue, Kamal.

1153
01:19:54,833 --> 01:19:56,583
Celeste, pretty dress.

1154
01:19:57,041 --> 01:19:59,541
Cedric, giant shark.

1155
01:20:04,916 --> 01:20:06,083
Is someone missing?

1156
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:09,541
Where is Rupert?

1157
01:20:11,166 --> 01:20:12,875
Rupert Donovan is gone!

1158
01:20:13,791 --> 01:20:15,750
Cedric! First warning.

1159
01:20:15,916 --> 01:20:16,791
No !

1160
01:20:17,958 --> 01:20:19,000
Sarah!

1161
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:26,041
It's not true...

1162
01:20:28,833 --> 01:20:30,000
What is going on ?

1163
01:20:30,166 --> 01:20:31,708
No. Everything is fine.

1164
01:20:34,208 --> 01:20:35,541
I can enter ?

1165
01:20:37,416 --> 01:20:39,166
Okay, why not?

1166
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,875
Rupert dropped it in college,
this morning.

1167
01:20:49,416 --> 01:20:50,791
What?

1168
01:20:50,958 --> 01:20:55,541
"Ms. Kureishi, do not worry,
I am in London for an audition. "

1169
01:20:57,416 --> 01:21:00,625
I forbade him
to go to this audition.

1170
01:21:02,625 --> 01:21:04,250
Ms. Turner,

1171
01:21:04,916 --> 01:21:08,083
I am certain
that you defended him ...

1172
01:21:08,250 --> 01:21:10,708
I'm fine, I'm not stupid, okay?

1173
01:21:14,541 --> 01:21:17,541
It'll be okay, will not it?
He has a cell phone?

1174
01:21:17,958 --> 01:21:19,833
- Call him.
- He wanted one.

1175
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,625
But it's a little boy.

1176
01:21:23,541 --> 01:21:25,125
On the other hand, he knows London.

1177
01:21:25,291 --> 01:21:28,416
He goes to see his father
every month, all alone.

1178
01:21:28,916 --> 01:21:31,833
Finally, he went there often.

1179
01:21:34,541 --> 01:21:36,833
I have a lecture
in Bracknell this afternoon,

1180
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,750
I will call his father,

1181
01:21:39,916 --> 01:21:43,500
he will put him back on the train
for Harrow.

1182
01:21:43,666 --> 01:21:44,625
Good.

1183
01:21:45,333 --> 01:21:46,875
Thank you, Mrs. Kureishi.

1184
01:21:47,041 --> 01:21:48,250
You're welcome.

1185
01:21:50,125 --> 01:21:52,458
I'll go.

1186
01:21:55,541 --> 01:21:58,041
- Mrs. Turner?
- Yes ?

1187
01:22:00,666 --> 01:22:01,750
Yes ?

1188
01:22:03,125 --> 01:22:04,500
I'm looking at Rupert,

1189
01:22:04,666 --> 01:22:08,625
and he has such a bright future
who is waiting for him.

1190
01:22:08,791 --> 01:22:10,000
You see...

1191
01:22:10,416 --> 01:22:13,708
This is not the case
of the majority of my students.

1192
01:22:14,125 --> 01:22:17,500
Let's say I see a future
for them,

1193
01:22:17,958 --> 01:22:20,666
but I rarely see

1194
01:22:23,041 --> 01:22:24,250
a destiny.

1195
01:22:27,916 --> 01:22:30,833
This is why,
I believe, that I came,

1196
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,458
instead of phoning.

1197
01:22:33,250 --> 01:22:37,625
I know my son is different.
I am not blind.

1198
01:22:48,666 --> 01:22:51,291
Rupert must be so ashamed
of me.

1199
01:22:51,458 --> 01:22:56,375
He must tell
lots of stuff on me,

1200
01:22:57,041 --> 01:22:59,666
fuck me
with all his friends.

1201
01:23:01,375 --> 01:23:04,666
Rupert is a very lonely child.

1202
01:23:05,875 --> 01:23:08,500
He does not trust so much.

1203
01:23:17,958 --> 01:23:19,541
Before, he confided.

1204
01:23:22,458 --> 01:23:25,791
I went through their written homework,
the other night,

1205
01:23:25,958 --> 01:23:29,083
and I saw that you did not have
signed his writing,

1206
01:23:29,250 --> 01:23:31,208
the one on the models.

1207
01:23:31,375 --> 01:23:34,333
Rupert exchanged letters
with a guy of 30 years

1208
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:36,916
for five years without anyone knowing

1209
01:23:38,083 --> 01:23:42,083
I understand that he did not hold
to have me read his writing.

1210
01:23:58,458 --> 01:24:00,375
I do not see why.

1211
01:24:02,166 --> 01:24:03,083
Have a good day.

1212
01:24:13,583 --> 01:24:16,375
<i> Choosing your mother or father
as a model </ i>

1213
01:24:16,541 --> 01:24:18,250
<i> no doubt lacks originality. </ i>

1214
01:24:18,708 --> 01:24:22,458
<i> But the person
whom I know and admire most, </ i>

1215
01:24:22,625 --> 01:24:25,333
<i> it's my mother, Sam Turner. </ i>

1216
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:33,208
<i> In recent years,
we moved away from each other, </ i>

1217
01:24:35,333 --> 01:24:37,500
<i> but you'll tell me, it's life. </ i>

1218
01:24:47,083 --> 01:24:48,666
<i> Sam was pregnant with me, </ i>

1219
01:24:48,833 --> 01:24:51,666
<i> my father left her
for another shortly after </ i>

1220
01:24:51,833 --> 01:24:53,708
<i> and moved to England. </ i>

1221
01:24:53,958 --> 01:24:56,041
<i> So she raised me alone. </ i>

1222
01:24:56,666 --> 01:24:59,833
<i> And for a moment,
it worked well. </ i>

1223
01:25:01,250 --> 01:25:03,916
My son Rupert
had an appointment at 13:30.

1224
01:25:04,625 --> 01:25:08,291
<i> I took care of her
and I even called it "my love", </ i>

1225
01:25:08,916 --> 01:25:11,041
<i> it made me feel
to be an adult. </ i>

1226
01:25:11,708 --> 01:25:13,458
<i> But in truth, </ i>

1227
01:25:14,333 --> 01:25:16,583
<i> it was only
my best friend. </ i>

1228
01:25:19,625 --> 01:25:21,958
<i> She called me Larry
instead of Rupert, </ i>

1229
01:25:22,125 --> 01:25:24,500
<i> and we watched movies together. </ i>

1230
01:25:24,666 --> 01:25:28,000
<i> I think we saw </ i> The Secret Garden
<i> a billion times. </ i>

1231
01:25:29,250 --> 01:25:32,750
<i> She stopped the theater
and I started to audition. </ i>

1232
01:25:34,750 --> 01:25:37,000
<i> I thought she would be proud
that I do one thing </ i>

1233
01:25:37,166 --> 01:25:39,875
<i> to which she had sucked. </ i>

1234
01:25:48,625 --> 01:25:53,208
<i> Over the years, Sam was disappointed
to see his dreams vanish, </ i>

1235
01:25:53,375 --> 01:25:56,708
<i> and we got here
in search of other dreams. </ i>

1236
01:25:58,166 --> 01:25:59,416
Sorry, my son is here ...

1237
01:25:59,583 --> 01:26:00,916
<i> It's hard for me, </ i>

1238
01:26:01,083 --> 01:26:04,333
<i> but I understand why
she wanted to be someone else. </ i>

1239
01:26:06,708 --> 01:26:09,000
<i> It's only hard to admit it. </ i>

1240
01:26:09,833 --> 01:26:12,458
<i> I know that I have instituted
this distance between us. </ i>

1241
01:26:13,083 --> 01:26:15,500
<i> Sometimes I would like
that our problems </ i>

1242
01:26:15,666 --> 01:26:18,625
<i> and the invisible wall between us
disappear. </ i>

1243
01:26:18,791 --> 01:26:21,458
<i> Let's meet each other, </ i>

1244
01:26:21,625 --> 01:26:23,916
<i> without having to worry about anything, </ i>

1245
01:26:24,083 --> 01:26:26,833
<i> without pride and without lies. </ i>

1246
01:26:27,250 --> 01:26:29,250
<i> Then I'll tell him the truth. </ i>

1247
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,416
<i> I'll tell him how much I love him. </ i>

1248
01:26:33,583 --> 01:26:34,916
Mum !

1249
01:27:02,583 --> 01:27:04,208
- Sorry !
- Sorry.

1250
01:27:04,791 --> 01:27:06,458
- I'm dumb !
- Are not you angry?

1251
01:27:06,625 --> 01:27:08,375
- I'm dumb.
- No, you're not stupid.

1252
01:27:08,541 --> 01:27:10,833
Your teacher has come,
I knew I was wrong.

1253
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:12,458
Afterwards, I read your writing.

1254
01:27:12,625 --> 01:27:13,583
It is true ?

1255
01:27:14,125 --> 01:27:16,750
I did not want to hurt you

1256
01:27:16,916 --> 01:27:19,291
and I'm sorry
that you find me limited.

1257
01:27:19,458 --> 01:27:21,833
You're not limited. Sorry.

1258
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,208
We will do it.

1259
01:27:23,375 --> 01:27:25,833
You, my Rupy, you'll be an actor.

1260
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:28,208
I will be there
to support you, okay?

1261
01:27:37,708 --> 01:27:40,083
<i> I guess you expected, right? </ i>

1262
01:27:40,541 --> 01:27:42,583
Barbara, it's a joke.

1263
01:27:44,166 --> 01:27:46,166
We have lived so many things together.

1264
01:27:46,666 --> 01:27:49,541
I need you and ...

1265
01:27:51,583 --> 01:27:52,958
Say it.

1266
01:27:56,666 --> 01:27:58,333
I need you ?

1267
01:28:00,750 --> 01:28:02,583
I need someone.

1268
01:28:03,875 --> 01:28:08,083
I carefully avoid needing
people for 40 years.

1269
01:28:10,958 --> 01:28:12,916
John, my big,

1270
01:28:14,416 --> 01:28:16,041
look around you.

1271
01:28:16,208 --> 01:28:18,833
Look at the paintings on the walls,
the carpet.

1272
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,458
The chair in which you are sitting.

1273
01:28:22,916 --> 01:28:24,625
I chose this life.

1274
01:28:29,291 --> 01:28:31,333
She could have been different,

1275
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:33,458
completely different.

1276
01:28:34,250 --> 01:28:36,458
I could have had everything.

1277
01:28:36,958 --> 01:28:39,500
If you knew how many times
I refused to work

1278
01:28:39,666 --> 01:28:42,333
with extraordinary actors,

1279
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:43,666
artists.

1280
01:28:44,166 --> 01:28:47,666
I could have joined
to prestigious agencies.

1281
01:28:47,833 --> 01:28:49,375
I have no doubt about it.

1282
01:28:49,541 --> 01:28:51,166
I'm not done.

1283
01:28:54,625 --> 01:28:57,041
I chose this life.

1284
01:29:00,500 --> 01:29:02,958
Not for lack of ambition,
I like money

1285
01:29:03,125 --> 01:29:05,833
and everything he brings, I like that.

1286
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:09,666
But I chose this life,
because it's the one I can live,

1287
01:29:10,416 --> 01:29:13,916
the one where I'm proud
to do my job well.

1288
01:29:16,375 --> 01:29:19,291
I could not handle
Careers of businessmen.

1289
01:29:20,375 --> 01:29:22,500
Not for lack of esteem
or respect.

1290
01:29:22,666 --> 01:29:25,125
I can meet them, meet them.

1291
01:29:25,291 --> 01:29:27,791
But I can not be them.

1292
01:29:30,583 --> 01:29:32,208
I am not a liar.

1293
01:29:35,791 --> 01:29:38,458
And if you become someone like that,

1294
01:29:40,208 --> 01:29:45,083
if you hire models
to be seen in restaurants,

1295
01:29:45,250 --> 01:29:47,041
or at charity nights ...

1296
01:29:47,208 --> 01:29:49,958
If you become someone
who despises others,

1297
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:54,666
who says to the kids
that they do not exist,

1298
01:29:56,333 --> 01:29:58,083
I will not follow you in this way.

1299
01:29:58,250 --> 01:30:00,541
It's an impasse, I know it.

1300
01:30:04,708 --> 01:30:06,250
I'm not stupid,

1301
01:30:07,458 --> 01:30:10,208
I know you can do it,
I am sure.

1302
01:30:11,500 --> 01:30:13,000
If that's what you want.

1303
01:30:15,041 --> 01:30:16,916
But I will not do that with you.

1304
01:30:20,083 --> 01:30:24,125
I saw too many friends
get lost in this spiral,

1305
01:30:24,291 --> 01:30:27,041
this black hole of the swagger

1306
01:30:27,208 --> 01:30:30,750
which is only
a waste of talent.

1307
01:30:31,958 --> 01:30:35,416
And time never catches up.

1308
01:30:45,291 --> 01:30:46,708
I'm finished.

1309
01:30:50,375 --> 01:30:53,166
<i> I have Eileen O'Neal on line 1. </ i>

1310
01:30:56,083 --> 01:31:00,208
You will find another agent.
It's better for you.

1311
01:31:00,375 --> 01:31:03,125
I will tell everyone
that you fired me.

1312
01:31:03,291 --> 01:31:04,375
Give it to me, Melanie.

1313
01:31:06,458 --> 01:31:08,208
What if I do not want to change?

1314
01:31:10,666 --> 01:31:12,458
Talk to your therapist.

1315
01:31:13,541 --> 01:31:15,416
Eileen, how are you?

1316
01:31:15,583 --> 01:31:17,458
I know, I wanted to call you.

1317
01:31:17,625 --> 01:31:19,875
I am overwhelmed. I'm very good.

1318
01:31:22,291 --> 01:31:23,833
Children, how are you?

1319
01:31:24,291 --> 01:31:25,833
At Disneyworld?

1320
01:31:28,833 --> 01:31:30,500
No, I'm fine

1321
01:31:37,166 --> 01:31:38,875
No, that's fine.

1322
01:32:14,958 --> 01:32:17,041
Shit, I should have called.

1323
01:32:18,250 --> 01:32:19,500
It is not serious.

1324
01:32:21,541 --> 01:32:23,250
They came by bus,

1325
01:32:23,416 --> 01:32:26,125
I bring them back tomorrow
for my brother's birthday.

1326
01:32:26,750 --> 01:32:28,000
It's great.

1327
01:32:31,083 --> 01:32:32,958
I can go later.

1328
01:32:35,083 --> 01:32:39,208
If they sleep at home,
we can go for a beer.

1329
01:32:43,833 --> 01:32:45,416
I need to talk.

1330
01:32:46,791 --> 01:32:48,000
With me ?

1331
01:32:51,166 --> 01:32:52,750
Yes.

1332
01:32:54,958 --> 01:32:57,250
No, you say nothing.

1333
01:32:57,708 --> 01:33:00,750
Listen, I believe

1334
01:33:02,083 --> 01:33:03,208
that all that ...

1335
01:33:04,041 --> 01:33:05,666
John, I love you,

1336
01:33:05,833 --> 01:33:09,500
but all that, this whole story,

1337
01:33:10,208 --> 01:33:12,583
this stuff pictures,

1338
01:33:13,291 --> 01:33:15,541
it's a little ... I do not know.

1339
01:33:16,125 --> 01:33:18,333
You're ashamed, right?

1340
01:33:18,500 --> 01:33:20,125
No.

1341
01:33:21,333 --> 01:33:22,833
But you, yes.

1342
01:33:26,208 --> 01:33:28,458
I wish you'd call me.

1343
01:33:30,333 --> 01:33:31,750
It was not the moment.

1344
01:33:31,916 --> 01:33:34,958
It is not serious.

1345
01:33:36,291 --> 01:33:37,625
Connor needs you!

1346
01:33:37,791 --> 01:33:39,625
A second, mom.

1347
01:33:39,791 --> 01:33:41,541
Sorry, I'm coming.

1348
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,791
Do what you have to do.

1349
01:33:51,041 --> 01:33:52,291
I am young.

1350
01:33:53,291 --> 01:33:55,958
I know what I want

1351
01:33:56,625 --> 01:33:58,666
and who am I?

1352
01:34:00,166 --> 01:34:02,583
Being the secret lover of someone,

1353
01:34:02,750 --> 01:34:05,333
it's not part of my projects.

1354
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:06,625
Okay ?

1355
01:34:09,041 --> 01:34:11,625
I'll let you in, but ...

1356
01:34:18,166 --> 01:34:19,500
I understand.

1357
01:34:20,666 --> 01:34:21,958
I am sorry.

1358

Sorry, I know
that this is not your name.

1407

No ... it's a high school.

1408
01:38:04,333 --> 01:38:06,375
- My name is...
- John F. Donovan.

I am not so old.

It must annoy you, but ...

1411
01:38:12,125 --> 01:38:14,958
my grandson is
one of your big fans.

1412
01:38:15,416 --> 01:38:18,583
I was with him
in Canal Street the other day,

1413
01:38:18,750 --> 01:38:22,958
he saw the poster of your series,
and he was no longer in place.

1414
01:38:24,625 --> 01:38:27,416
He stayed there
for five minutes.

1415
01:38:28,625 --> 01:38:31,583
He wants to be like you,
when he will be tall.

1416
01:38:32,750 --> 01:38:34,916
Magic powers included, of course.

1417
01:38:36,500 --> 01:38:37,541
Oh?

1418
01:38:38,250 --> 01:38:39,791
I assure you.

1419
01:38:44,083 --> 01:38:45,750
I do not bother you anymore.

1420
01:38:45,916 --> 01:38:48,166
No, you do not bother me. Stay.

1421
01:38:50,958 --> 01:38:52,708
You're really nice.

1422
01:38:53,250 --> 01:38:55,875
You settle there
to be a little quiet

1423
01:38:56,041 --> 01:38:58,708
and an old fool arrives
braying.

1424
01:38:59,541 --> 01:39:02,458
No, really, it's ...

1425
01:39:05,500 --> 01:39:08,625
We are waiting for your next
extraordinary adventure.

1426
01:39:09,541 --> 01:39:11,125
I do not know sir.

1427
01:39:12,625 --> 01:39:13,500
What?

1428
01:39:14,458 --> 01:39:16,041
I do not know anymore.

1429
01:39:23,416 --> 01:39:25,916
I feel ... Sorry ...

1430
01:39:26,083 --> 01:39:27,791
I have the impression ...

1431
01:39:32,333 --> 01:39:33,583
Talk to me.

1432
01:39:36,166 --> 01:39:37,708
I have the impression

1433
01:39:39,083 --> 01:39:42,291
that I ruined everything.

1434
01:39:42,458 --> 01:39:43,708
You understand ?

1435
01:39:45,083 --> 01:39:46,750
I keep telling myself ...

1436
01:39:49,208 --> 01:39:52,125
What if I did not have anything to do there?

1437
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:56,375
If I had stolen another's place?

1438
01:39:58,333 --> 01:40:00,208
Say something.

1439
01:40:00,375 --> 01:40:01,875
Make fun of me.

1440
01:40:02,041 --> 01:40:03,291
Oh dear !

1441
01:40:04,291 --> 01:40:08,875
Who am I to collect
these confessions?

1442
01:40:10,625 --> 01:40:12,166
I know.

1443
01:40:12,916 --> 01:40:17,291
Sorry, you should leave,
I should not have bothered you.

1444
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:20,708
In my opinion,

1445
01:40:22,458 --> 01:40:24,041
things are simple.

1446
01:40:24,791 --> 01:40:26,583
People, however,

1447
01:40:27,750 --> 01:40:30,833
have a mysterious propensity

1448
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,125
to make them complicated.

1449
01:40:35,833 --> 01:40:38,333
You already know
that you were wrong,

1450
01:40:39,458 --> 01:40:42,500
what distinguishes you
from most people.

1451
01:40:44,708 --> 01:40:48,250
Personally, I look at you,

1452
01:40:49,708 --> 01:40:50,958
and all that I see,

1453
01:40:51,125 --> 01:40:55,458
he is a young man whose
my grandson enjoys the job.

1454
01:40:57,916 --> 01:41:00,708
How you chose
to fix your mistakes

1455
01:41:01,166 --> 01:41:03,875
is your business and that of God.

1456
01:41:05,291 --> 01:41:07,666
But the question is ...

1457
01:41:11,333 --> 01:41:13,833
How could you
stealing a place

1458
01:41:16,125 --> 01:41:19,625
who was created specifically for you?

1459
01:41:32,083 --> 01:41:34,708
Sorry,
but I have never seen you here.

1460
01:41:37,041 --> 01:41:38,875
You see me now.

1461
01:41:41,333 --> 01:41:44,708
Damn,
I think I should go.

1462
01:41:47,625 --> 01:41:49,083
Go home.

1463
01:41:50,541 --> 01:41:54,750
You are too young to eat alone
in shabby kitchens.

1464
01:42:14,166 --> 01:42:15,250
Mum !

1465
01:42:23,750 --> 01:42:25,541
What are you doing here ?

1466
01:42:31,125 --> 01:42:33,208
I must say that it's really

1467
01:42:34,125 --> 01:42:35,541
the ideal evening.

1468
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:44,083
So, Amy is fine?

1469
01:42:52,708 --> 01:42:56,083
It's because
did you meet someone?

1470
01:42:57,250 --> 01:42:59,500
Someone else ?

1471
01:43:05,875 --> 01:43:07,000
No !

1472
01:43:07,166 --> 01:43:09,208
You will not do that to me. Stopped.

1473
01:43:09,375 --> 01:43:11,625
- Sorry.
- You're not leaving already!

1474
01:43:11,791 --> 01:43:13,791
In the middle of the game You laugh ?

1475
01:43:13,958 --> 01:43:16,041
I've got to go. Sorry.

1476
01:43:18,916 --> 01:43:19,958
Sorry.

1477
01:43:21,916 --> 01:43:22,916
Sorry.

1478
01:43:27,375 --> 01:43:28,666
I dunno...

1479
01:43:29,958 --> 01:43:32,250
Damn, I'm not good at it.

1480
01:43:34,541 --> 01:43:35,916
You know, John,

1481
01:43:37,958 --> 01:43:40,708
I read a lot of things about you.

1482
01:43:40,875 --> 01:43:43,625
Everyone passes me articles.
I read everything.

1483
01:43:43,791 --> 01:43:45,250
I see everything you do,

1484
01:43:45,416 --> 01:43:47,500
all emissions,
your job, everything.

1485
01:43:47,666 --> 01:43:49,708
I am your career and ...

1486
01:43:50,500 --> 01:43:53,208
There is something you said ...

1487
01:43:53,375 --> 01:43:55,333
Mom, what did you read?

1488
01:43:57,375 --> 01:43:59,375
You said it many times.

1489
01:44:01,708 --> 01:44:02,916
You said that ...

1490
01:44:04,666 --> 01:44:06,041
You said we ...

1491
01:44:07,500 --> 01:44:11,666
we did not come
from the same planet.

1492
01:44:21,166 --> 01:44:23,625
I come from this planet.

1493
01:44:25,083 --> 01:44:26,333
And you,

1494
01:44:27,791 --> 01:44:28,875
you come

1495
01:44:30,708 --> 01:44:33,750
of me.

1496
01:44:35,833 --> 01:44:37,250
And I know that...

1497
01:44:38,083 --> 01:44:43,000
I do not think a mother
is supposed to be the friend of his son,

1498
01:44:48,083 --> 01:44:49,875
but I know you.

1499
01:44:52,708 --> 01:44:55,083
And I was the first.

1500
01:45:01,041 --> 01:45:03,375
So we play cards, okay?

1501
01:45:05,833 --> 01:45:06,916
Mum ?

1502
01:45:10,083 --> 01:45:12,208
You could make me sink a bath

1503
01:45:13,250 --> 01:45:16,708
and ask me to spell words,
like before ?

1504
01:45:17,458 --> 01:45:19,166
If you want.

1505
01:45:21,958 --> 01:45:23,666
Can I sleep here?

1506
01:45:24,583 --> 01:45:27,458
Honey,
you can stay your whole life.

1507
01:45:34,083 --> 01:45:36,000
Really funny !

1508
01:45:36,833 --> 01:45:38,125
Stopped !

1509
01:45:38,291 --> 01:45:39,916
You should try.

1510
01:45:40,083 --> 01:45:41,791
Stop jumping on this bed.

1511
01:45:41,958 --> 01:45:45,166
You'll break it, you'll break everything,
and you will break a bone.

1512
01:45:46,500 --> 01:45:49,875
Who can dry their hair
in this blue light?

1513
01:45:52,500 --> 01:45:54,333
Do you want to go back to England?

1514
01:46:01,291 --> 01:46:02,833
- Mum ?
- Yes ?

1515
01:46:04,125 --> 01:46:06,541
You think John answered
to my letter?

1516
01:46:06,708 --> 01:46:08,625
The reception promised to call.

1517
01:46:09,458 --> 01:46:12,208
See the positive side, darling.

1518
01:46:15,875 --> 01:46:17,791
It's the full moon.

1519
01:46:17,958 --> 01:46:20,375
It is surely a sign.

1520
01:46:25,541 --> 01:46:26,958
I imagine.

1521
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:31,916
It will be hard to avoid the fumette
between mother and son on my Myspace.

1522
01:46:32,083 --> 01:46:33,583
This one looks pretty good.

1523
01:46:33,750 --> 01:46:35,083
Prandrial?

1524
01:46:35,250 --> 01:46:38,083
What is that thing ? Pre-meal.

1525
01:46:38,458 --> 01:46:39,500
It's easy.

1526
01:46:39,666 --> 01:46:44,666
P-R-P-P-R-A-N-D-I-A-L.

1527
01:46:45,500 --> 01:46:47,916
"That occurs before the meal."

1528
01:46:48,083 --> 01:46:49,041
What a nerd!

1529
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:54,125
That's it ?

1530
01:46:55,375 --> 01:46:57,375
Sorry. What?

1531
01:46:57,750 --> 01:47:00,541
It's written like that, is it good?

1532
01:47:11,416 --> 01:47:13,208
Honey, how are you?

1533
01:47:15,875 --> 01:47:17,250
I'm fine.

1534
01:47:17,583 --> 01:47:18,458
You're sure ?

1535
01:47:19,541 --> 01:47:20,833
I'm fine.

1536
01:47:22,625 --> 01:47:25,791
There are some tips
who will change, that's all.

1537
01:47:27,791 --> 01:47:31,708
It's a little scary,
but you know, you only have to ...

1538
01:47:33,708 --> 01:47:35,708
you just have to be yourself.

1539
01:47:37,666 --> 01:47:39,166
The horrible thing!

1540
01:47:40,583 --> 01:47:42,166
Shut up, sweetheart!

1541
01:47:42,333 --> 01:47:45,125
Damn, how are you? Connard!

1542
01:47:46,291 --> 01:47:48,333
- Attention, boys!
- Get louder.

1543
01:47:48,500 --> 01:47:50,000
- Break.
- I love this song.

1544
01:47:50,166 --> 01:47:51,125
- Go ahead.
- Serious?

1545
01:47:51,291 --> 01:47:52,500
I know.

1546
01:47:52,666 --> 01:47:54,750
It's a great song!

1547
01:49:09,666 --> 01:49:10,958
<i> I think that ... </ i>

Yes ?

01:49:50,166 --> 01:49:52,583
Yes, bring it.

1557
01:49:53,375 --> 01:49:54,291
Sorry.

1558
01:49:54,458 --> 01:49:56,083
If my son sees
the letter now,

1559
01:49:56,250 --> 01:49:57,958
it'll make him crazy.

1560
01:49:58,958 --> 01:50:02,708
It's from Mr. Donovan?

1561
01:50:03,291 --> 01:50:05,250
No, I do not think so, Mrs. Turner.

1562
01:50:05,416 --> 01:50:06,625
A young man has filed it

1563
01:50:06,791 --> 01:50:09,750
saying only
to hand it over to Rupert Turner.

1564
01:50:12,916 --> 01:50:14,375
I'm sorry.

1565
01:50:15,875 --> 01:50:16,791
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

<i> "I'll find a way
to join you, promised </ i>.

1600
01:53:04,208 --> 01:53:06,333
<i> "Soon, I will go back to life." </ i>

1601
01:53:08,375 --> 01:53:10,125
John, it's me.

1602
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:15,791
<i> "But for now, </ i>

1603
01:53:18,625 --> 01:53:20,500

1604
01:53:25,916 --> 01:53:29,875

1607
01:54:07,875 --> 01:54:11,500
I will not hide it from you,
after all that,

1608
01:54:11,666 --> 01:54:15,625
I am a little curious
to know if...

1609
01:54:20,250 --> 01:54:21,750
If he committed suicide?

1610
01:54:24,708 --> 01:54:26,583
We will never really know it.

1611
01:54:27,083 --> 01:54:30,916
I do not know anything else
than what he wrote to me.

1612
01:54:31,083 --> 01:54:32,291
Maybe...

1613
01:54:33,291 --> 01:54:35,250
he committed suicide
because he had dipped

1614
01:54:35,416 --> 01:54:38,250
in deep despair, etc.

1615
01:54:40,125 --> 01:54:42,166
It's a bit easy, right?

1616
01:54:43,250 --> 01:54:45,375
Either he really wanted to sleep

1617
01:54:46,750 --> 01:54:49,125
and he made a very serious mistake.

1618
01:54:49,916 --> 01:54:54,208
In his last letter,
he looks hopeful.

1619
01:54:54,791 --> 01:54:58,041
And you will understand
that, for obvious reasons,

1620
01:54:59,916 --> 01:55:03,375
this is the version
that I chose to believe.

1621
01:55:08,208 --> 01:55:09,958
All right, Rupert.

1622
01:55:11,875 --> 01:55:12,958
Thank you.

1623
01:55:13,416 --> 01:55:15,875
I'm sorry for this bad start.

1624
01:55:17,750 --> 01:55:19,875
Do not worry.

1625
01:55:20,041 --> 01:55:21,541
I take care of the bill.

1626
01:55:22,333 --> 01:55:24,458
- They come to get me.
- Go for it.

1627
01:55:33,166 --> 01:55:35,500
- Good luck.
- I just have a scene.

1628
01:55:35,666 --> 01:55:38,041
No, I'm not talking about today.

1629
01:55:38,208 --> 01:55:40,000
I want to say...

1630
01:55:40,750 --> 01:55:42,041
in your career,

1631
01:55:42,208 --> 01:55:43,500
your life.

1632
01:55:44,875 --> 01:55:47,166
I hope you will
what you want.

1633
01:55:47,666 --> 01:55:49,375
I already have what I want.

1634
01:55:50,458 --> 01:55:51,666
All the better.

1635
01:56:03,166 --> 01:56:04,291
See you soon.
