3
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:02,980
So Sarah's not coming?

4
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:04,774
No.

5
00:01:04,899 --> 00:01:09,653
She has a girls' brunch
or a shower or something.

6
00:01:09,779 --> 00:01:11,197
You got in a fight.

7
00:01:11,322 --> 00:01:12,448
Not at all.

8
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:14,825
We're actually in a really good place.

9
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,119
Oh, fuck!

10
00:01:18,162 --> 00:01:22,541
OK, don't freak out, but Rivette's sister
is gonna be there tonight.

11
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:26,212
Fucking hell!
Doesn't he know we hate her?

12
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:30,841
She won't bother us.
She's shooting a film for school.

13
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:34,637
She'll annoy the fuck out of us with that.

14
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:37,431
Rivette said she'd stay out of our way.

15
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:40,059
She'll do her thing.
We'll do ours.

16
00:01:40,184 --> 00:01:41,894
We won't even know she's there.

17
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:08,546
GIVE US OUR DAILY BREAD...

18
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:13,259
SAINT-FAMILY BREAD!

19
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:22,393
OK.

20
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:06,145
<i>What took you so long?
Which way did you take?</i>

21
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:10,065
<i>Look, we got here.
Does it matter how?</i>

22
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:11,775
<i>Take this.</i>

23
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:16,655
<i>Matt, I know you'll be as happy as I am
to learn that my sister's here.</i>

24
00:03:18,032 --> 00:03:22,578
<i>She's off with her friend Matisse.
They're filming trees or some shit.</i>

25
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:29,126
You didn't drive 125 km
to sit on the fucking counter, OK?

26
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:31,587
They just got here!
Give 'em a minute!

27
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,671
What's up?

28
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:33,881
Same old, bruh.

29
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:35,758
OK, let's go.
The sun's gonna set.

30
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:37,551
- Are you shitting me?
- What?

31
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:39,136
I literally just told you.

32
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:40,262
Frank.

33
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,306
At this rate,
I won't make it to dinner.

34
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:43,641
Max?

35
00:03:44,642 --> 00:03:45,643
- Max?
- Brass.

36
00:03:45,768 --> 00:03:47,561
- What?
- Stop it!

37
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:49,521
What? We're still on that?

38
00:03:49,647 --> 00:03:54,526
I know you don't touch the hard stuff,
but it's just weed. I forgot.

39
00:03:54,652 --> 00:03:56,403
You never listen!

40
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:57,655
Do you ever listen?

41
00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:00,741
Well, it's nice to be among friends!

42
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:02,618
Poor Brass needs some love!

43
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:06,538
You guys are always giving me shit.
I'm sick of it.

44
00:04:06,664 --> 00:04:08,707
Go fuck yourselves.
No, let me go!

45
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,085
Don't touch me! Stop it!

46
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:15,256
- OK, guys! Let's go!
- Just go swimming, idiot!

47
00:04:15,381 --> 00:04:17,841
- OK, I'm going.
- I'm down too.

48
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,013
Hey, guys?

49
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:24,932
Here we go.

50
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:29,436
OMG, so, like, my friends
were supposed to drive down

51
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:30,688
to shoot the film,

52
00:04:30,813 --> 00:04:33,107
but, like, last minute,
they ghosted.

53
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:36,402
Come on!
Main menu: proper French.

54
00:04:36,986 --> 00:04:38,779
No, just the stupid bitch version!

55
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:41,282
Are you sure that's not
the bony fag version?

56
00:04:41,407 --> 00:04:43,909
OK, your friends bailed.
Who cares?

57
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:46,578
Well, they were supposed to play
in the film.

58
00:04:46,704 --> 00:04:48,205
- Oh boy!
- Matt!

59
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:53,419
So, like, would two of you guys
be down to play in the film?

60
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:55,004
Me, never.

61
00:04:55,421 --> 00:04:58,549
To <i>act</i> in the film, Erika.
You study film, dipshit!

62
00:04:58,674 --> 00:05:00,134
Get off my back, homo!

63
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:02,845
Look, you told Mom
you'd stay out of our way.

64
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:06,056
- So leave my friends alone!
- Let them fucking decide!

65
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:11,061
I'll do it.

66
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:16,734
I don't mind acting in your film.

67
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:20,070
Oh my God! You're so nice!
Told you Max was the chillest.

68
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:21,322
OK, fuck off.

69
00:05:21,447 --> 00:05:22,698
But I need two people.

70
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:25,200
I'm gonna kill you.
Is that what you want?

71
00:05:26,577 --> 00:05:27,911
No, I can't act for shit.

72
00:05:28,037 --> 00:05:30,873
Ask Brass. No, ask Frank!

73
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:32,124
Yeah, ask Frank!

74
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,043
Good one!

75
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:35,419
All right.

76
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:40,507
But seriously, guys, if you're down,
I'm fucking down. For real.

77
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:48,807
$24,000 a year to talk like a bimbo
and Instagram her breakfast burrito.

78
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:50,851
You're fucking crazy!

79
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:53,312
You were good in <i>Anna Karenina</i>
in high school.

80
00:05:53,437 --> 00:05:57,649
- Shut the fuck up, asswad!
- But you were touching!

81
00:05:57,775 --> 00:05:59,360
The crying felt real!

82
00:05:59,485 --> 00:06:02,654
An illiterate douche crying
with a Parisian accent!

83
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:05,115
Or an elephant trying to floss.

84
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:07,451
Drown him!

85
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:08,786
Let go of me, fuckface!

86
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:11,372
You like it when I touch you, don't you?

87
00:06:11,497 --> 00:06:12,623
Let go!

88
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,209
Just shut your eyes
and think of your teacher!

89
00:06:15,334 --> 00:06:16,293
Fuck off!

90
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:18,462
Think about that old, old man!

91
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:22,925
Yo mama so fat,
her Patronus is a Burger King.

92
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,469
Yo mama so fat,
she <i>ate</i> her Patronus.

93
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:30,474
I don't think I'll come back
for the first Christmas.

94
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:34,645
Really?

95
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,818
So you'll be gone a full year?

96
00:06:40,943 --> 00:06:42,444
Yeah.

97
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:50,577
And...

98
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:54,373
what about your mom?

99
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:58,919
My aunt Ginette is gonna take care of her.

100
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:02,881
Yeah. We went to the notary.

101
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:07,469
She's gonna take over as guardian.

102
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,888
I mean, I'm not the only one
in the family.

103
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:14,226
And it's pretty simple.

104
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:18,230
You pay the bills, buy groceries,
make sure there's no cash lying around.

105
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:20,190
Any idiot can do it.

106
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,136
Yeah, I'm allowed.
It's the Commonwealth.

107
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:50,971
I don't need a visa.

108
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:52,181
Yeah, OK.

109
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:53,724
You gonna bartend, still?

110
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:57,060
You do need some documents.
You can't just waltz in.

111
00:07:57,186 --> 00:08:00,856
That's why I need that
letter of recommendation from your dad.

112
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:03,859
I'm working on it.
It's not my fault he's busy.

113
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:05,903
Wait, I don't get it.

114
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:10,449
You're not volunteering.
You're gonna make some cash, right?

115
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:13,243
No, he's going to a country
that doesn't take Visa.

116
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,833
- Come on, dummy!
- But Max?

117
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:24,296
Yeah, I'll work in a bar at first.

118
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:25,797
It's easy. I know how.

119
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:29,927
You're going all the way to Melbourne
to work the same shitty job?

120
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:33,388
Wire him $200,000,
and he can be your roommate at Cambridge.

121
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:37,809
No, but I'm fine with it.
I'll work in a bar at first.

122
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:42,981
And slowly, I'll start to find my...

123
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:44,858
- Bearings.
- My bearings.

124
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:46,902
Jesus Christ!

125
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:49,821
The art of shoving words
right down people's throats!

126
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:52,407
My bearings.

127
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:53,784
Fuck off!

128
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:56,745
- You've done that since we were kids.
- It's true.

129
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,996
Excuse me?

130
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:00,165
You always do that.
You always have.

131
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,708
I've never done that before.

132
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:03,961
- What?
- Come on!

133
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:06,755
What? Are you crazy, Matt?

134
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:09,007
What are you talking about?

135
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:11,260
I'm talking about your mental illness!

136
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:12,719
You're mental!

137
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:15,722
I've done that two, three,
maybe four times.

138
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:19,351
You did it at Suzie's birthday last month!

139
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:22,854
You corrected some grammar thing
while I was lighting the candles.

140
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,189
Brass got it on video.

141
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:26,400
No. I don't remember it, anyway.

142
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:29,027
It's on Instagram or something.

143
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:32,030
- Wow, aren't you cool! Show me!
- I'm gonna.

144
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:35,742
- Someone's here.
- Must be Shariff.

145
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:37,869
I said I was lighting
the birthday cake.

146
00:09:37,995 --> 00:09:40,372
You were like:
"You light candles, not cake."

147
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:41,540
So pretentious!

148
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:43,375
It's true,
but I never said that.

149
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,585
You did it at the gym.

150
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,378
- What?
- At the gym earlier.

151
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:47,713
What did I say?

152
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:50,591
Well, if it isn't Shariff-with-our-taxes!

153
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:56,388
How are my favorite bitches?

154
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:04,938
He's buying fancy new clothes
with our tax dollars!

155
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:08,066
While you write your bullshit thesis,
we're working real jobs!

156
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,986
I built a car with my bare hands
to get me to school!

157
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:15,324
So, what are the taxpayers conferring on
on this tranquil night in the country?

158
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:17,034
Who are you? Denys Arcand?

159
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:18,327
You high?

160
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:21,455
Depends.
But what were you talking about?

161
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,581
Nothing.

162
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:24,833
No, about Matt's need
to always be right.

163
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,168
That's not even it!

164
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:28,545
He was saying I corrected his grammar
on one fucking word.

165
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:32,299
Oh my God! Matt the grammar Nazi.
Timeless classic.

166
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:33,800
You're winning, Rivette?

167
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:37,971
Is eating like a pig
part of the hipster rocker starter-pack?

168
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:41,350
And get your feet off the table, hobo!

169
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:43,143
Come on, guys!

170
00:10:45,354 --> 00:10:48,815
Warning: I'm getting dangerously close
to the video.

171
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:52,444
Guys, guys! What's that smell?

172
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,571
What?

173
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:56,698
- I don't smell it.
- Oh, never mind.

174
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,992
It's just the smell of Matt losing a bet.

175
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,329
Am I on trial now, here?

176
00:11:02,454 --> 00:11:06,166
Oh, snap! I found it!
Best day of my life.

177
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,293
- If I'm right...
- You get nothing.

178
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,671
No way! You want to be right.

179
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:12,923
You're 100% sure you never said that?

180
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:14,591
100%, but I won't bet.

181
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:16,093
We don't have to bet money.

182
00:11:16,218 --> 00:11:19,471
Wait, why not? Rivette made a mistake,
Matt corrected him?

183
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:20,514
Yeah.

184
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:23,100
Shit, guys!
I have student loans to pay off!

185
00:11:23,225 --> 00:11:25,477
- I know what to bet.
- Fuck off, dickwad.

186
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:27,104
We'll bet your Desponts.

187
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:28,647
It's not "Desponts," it's...

188
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:31,775
Whatever, I'm not betting
the lighter my father gave me.

189
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,528
- You don't even smoke!
- I smoke socially.

190
00:11:34,653 --> 00:11:37,531
Especially while correcting grammar
at birthday parties.

191
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:40,117
OK, bet whatever, fuckface! Do it!

192
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:42,452
I know what we'll bet.

193
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,996
But I can't say it.

194
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:46,790
That's not fair.

195
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:49,960
You won't lose anything
or suffer physically.

196
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:51,586
No jumping in the lake.
Trust me.

197
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:52,921
Tell me, Rivette.

198
00:11:57,634 --> 00:12:00,345
If you're right, you're right.
Isn't that enough?

199
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:19,740
Matt, you have to promise
you'll do it.

200
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,825
Seriously, Matt, it's fine.

201
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:24,870
I know I'll win anyway.
I never said that.

202
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:26,288
Not at that party.

203
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:39,968
<i>- I'm lighting the cake!
- You light candles, not cakes.</i>

204
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,975
That's exactly it, fucker!

205
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:50,395
Fuck! Goddammit!

206
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:56,526
OK, you win.
What's the bet?

207
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,031
You have to be in Erika's film.

208
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:04,743
Well friggin' played!

209
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:07,704
Oh my God!
Did I hear that right?

210
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:10,916
I got fucked.

211
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:15,337
I told you she'd annoy us
with her stupid film, didn't I?

212
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:18,340
Might not be stupid.

213
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:19,591
Come on.

214
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:26,640
Excuse me, guys.

215
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:30,268
Have you two ever kissed before?

216
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:34,689
Never while washing dishes.

217
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:41,112
But seriously.

218
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:42,656
No.

219
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,285
Maybe...

220
00:13:48,954 --> 00:13:50,705
that one time...

221
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:53,041
In high school, I think.

222
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,668
No!

223
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:03,468
So not for a long time, right?

224
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:06,263
'Cause that's the scene.

225
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:12,310
Two guys.

226
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:14,688
Two guys making out.

227
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:22,904
You're such a dick, Marco!
You're being so injust!

228
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:24,656
I'm not being <i>unjust,</i> Erika.

229
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:26,992
You're pissing us off
with your dumb ideas!

230
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:30,287
It's not dumb.
But you should've told us before.

231
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:31,746
You made a fucking bet!

232
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:35,917
- Matt, you can't bitch out!
- That's not the issue.

233
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:41,131
Who the fuck cares?

234
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:43,592
You guys are always
braiding each other's hair

235
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:45,427
and wrestling and shit.

236
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:47,429
Like, Jesus! Chill, guys!

237
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:56,646
Shut the fuck up, assclown!

238
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:58,189
Why didn't you tell us?

239
00:14:58,315 --> 00:14:59,649
Who cares?

240
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:03,403
Stop speaking English,
you wacky hoe!

241
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:06,239
What's the difference? There!

242
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:13,079
It doesn't bother me.
That's not it.

243
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:15,373
It's no problem. It's fine.

244
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:17,417
We've done it before anyway.

245
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:18,460
Stop saying that!

246
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:19,669
- What?
- It's true.

247
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:23,965
Yeah, at Karine Mercier's party,
freshman year, Logan Street!

248
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,010
Frankie, the Stalking Mofo!

249
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:29,930
I took three hits of ecstasy.
It wasn't kicking in.

250
00:15:30,055 --> 00:15:32,641
Anyway, I don't care!
It doesn't bother me.

251
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:52,410
What the fuck?

252
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,351
Dumbass.

253
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,950
Oh my God! It's so beautiful!

254
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:02,582
Do I have to wear this?

255
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:04,876
I think it adds contrast to it.

256
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:10,924
And does Vegeta have to be here?

257
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:13,051
Who's Vegeta?

258
00:18:13,802 --> 00:18:15,595
The asshole on <i>Dragon Ball.</i>

259
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,097
The HBO show?

260
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:20,225
Never mind. Could he...

261
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:25,396
Could you maybe
finish that upstairs?

262
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:27,816
Your creation?

263
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:38,409
So, basically, like,

264
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:43,248
the film is, like,
super impressionistic,

265
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:45,917
but it's also,
like, expressionist.

266
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:47,794
Are you following me?

267
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:53,925
Well, I'm not an expert,

268
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:58,680
but impressionism
and expressionism,

269
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:01,724
can you have both at once?

270
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:05,520
Well, actually,
that brings me to the synopsis.

271
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:08,857
Two women.
You're, like, two women or men.

272
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:12,777
And all of a sudden, bam!
You're kissing.

273
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:18,324
But, I mean... Sorry.

274
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:21,786
Don't wanna kill your vibe, but...

275
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:23,997
we're guys.

276
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:25,999
Oh my God! You're too cute!

277
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:29,377
OK, like, it's kind of tricky, 'cause...

278
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:34,174
for your generation, like, maybe.

279
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:37,635
But I don't, like,
use labels to define myself.

280
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,971
And visually, for sure,

281
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:43,683
but apart from the beard
and all that masculine shit,

282
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:45,643
like, who really knows?

283
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:48,563
Did they really make out
in high school?

284
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:49,772
Yeah, it's a classic.

285
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:52,525
If it was a classic,
Matt would remember.

286
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:55,653
Anyway, I was there,
and I never heard about it.

287
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:57,238
Well...

288
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:01,701
What?

289
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:04,579
Dumbest shit you've ever said.

290
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:07,040
- What?
- You're in psych at Cambridge.

291
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:09,375
You think Matt's gonna
get a tat on his face:

292
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,128
"I made out with Max in high school.
Never forget!"

293
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:16,633
Best day of my life! Thank you!

294
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:21,554
Frank's a university janitor
who solves math problems at night.

295
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,058
Doesn't take a genius
to come up with that. Chill out.

296
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:26,893
Yes. Frank is Will Hunting.

297
00:20:27,018 --> 00:20:29,103
He's read every damn book
in the library.

298
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:31,731
I got anger issues,
but I'm smart as a fox.

299
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:33,399
Smart my ass.

300
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:35,068
Well, it was pretty—

301
00:20:37,946 --> 00:20:40,073
You are <i>not</i> hidden, fuckers!

302
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:44,327
Go.

303
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:50,917
In four, three, two, one.

304
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:52,168
Action.

305
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:58,151
You asleep?

306
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:34,015
Can I help you?

307
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:37,727
The Rivette cottage?

308
00:24:37,852 --> 00:24:39,812
- Rivette?
- Yeah.

309
00:24:40,855 --> 00:24:43,316
Good Lord!
That's not next door, son!

310
00:24:43,441 --> 00:24:45,401
Do you want me to drive you?

311
00:24:59,874 --> 00:25:02,543
What the fuck is he doing
way out there?

312
00:25:32,615 --> 00:25:33,908
Holy shit!

313
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:36,869
I got lost.

314
00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:39,121
What were you doing out there?

315
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:46,879
You OK, Matt?

316
00:25:59,976 --> 00:26:03,980
TWELVE DAYS BEFORE AUSTRALIA

317
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:05,768
<i>You'd make daddy proud!</i>

318
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:09,230
I actually took the liberty
of texting Mr. Ruiz

319
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:13,234
to tell him his boy
was climbing the ladder!

320
00:28:13,818 --> 00:28:17,446
Now, I don't want to
put the cart before the horse,

321
00:28:17,571 --> 00:28:21,367
but you are very impressive.

322
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:23,953
And I think that in...

323
00:28:24,078 --> 00:28:27,832
I can't say when exactly.
Let's keep it vague for now.

324
00:28:27,957 --> 00:28:31,669
But soon, or shall I say,
it won't be long...

325
00:28:31,794 --> 00:28:32,753
That's it.

326
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:37,591
It won't be long before
I give you more responsibility,

327
00:28:37,717 --> 00:28:41,721
or as I like to call it,
a two-window office!

328
00:28:50,104 --> 00:28:52,398
Well?

329
00:28:55,943 --> 00:28:58,487
No, I'm...

330
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:03,451
Obviously, I'm very happy to hear it.

331
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:05,453
You know, Matt...

332
00:29:05,578 --> 00:29:07,204
No, Gilles, it's just that—

333
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:08,873
No, wait, wait!

334
00:29:10,875 --> 00:29:13,961
At your age, it's normal to have...

335
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:16,005
doubts.

336
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:17,214
To doubt.

337
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,259
And try new things.

338
00:29:21,719 --> 00:29:23,637
You wake up one day, and...

339
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:27,308
you're stuck.

340
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:30,186
Yep.

341
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,522
Sometimes, you spend your life
doing one thing,

342
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:36,609
and in the end,
it wasn't <i>your</i> thing.

343
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:44,575
OK, we'll forget about
the promotion, for now!

344
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:48,913
Let's get back to the Thompson case.
Where is it?

345
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:51,749
This morning, I spoke to Mrs...

346
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:56,003
What's her name again?
Names, story of my life...

347
00:30:05,262 --> 00:30:08,933
OK, just hang on a minute.
I'm completely lost.

348
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:19,193
What are you doing?

349
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:24,240
I'm making those noodles you like.

350
00:30:28,702 --> 00:30:30,704
Have you heard from your brother?

351
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:38,003
You still like the noodles, right?
You did last time.

352
00:30:38,128 --> 00:30:39,380
Yeah, yeah.

353
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:44,385
The little shit won't return my calls.

354
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:48,180
What's the deal?

355
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:02,236
You don't have to smoke
the second you get up.

356
00:31:21,672 --> 00:31:23,173
What are you doing?

357
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:42,234
Quit playing.
Give it!

358
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:09,762
I'm seeing Aunt Ginette tomorrow.

359
00:32:09,887 --> 00:32:11,639
Lucky you!

360
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:18,520
She's semi-retired now.
She can take care of you while I'm gone.

361
00:32:18,646 --> 00:32:20,814
I don't need that crazy bitch here.

362
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,816
I'm not in a wheelchair.

363
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:28,530
For the paperwork, groceries, money.
The guardianship.

364
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:31,158
She's gonna do it.

365
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:32,451
Excuse me?

366
00:32:32,576 --> 00:32:35,913
You know you need someone
to take care of you.

367
00:32:36,038 --> 00:32:38,666
I don't need anyone!
Get that through your head!

368
00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:41,669
I don't need you or her or anyone!
I don't need anything!

369
00:32:41,794 --> 00:32:44,338
Calm down.
I don't wanna hear that rant!

370
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:46,715
I'll rant if I want to.
This is my house!

371
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,009
- Well, I pay the bills.
- With my money!

372
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:51,303
You just take it
to come here and shit on me!

373
00:32:51,428 --> 00:32:53,973
And you can be trusted
with money?

374
00:32:54,098 --> 00:32:58,435
You're suffocating me!
Mister-I'm-a-Dictator!

375
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,270
I'm sick of your fucking face!

376
00:33:00,396 --> 00:33:02,022
I'll come back when you're calm.

377
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:04,692
Good thing your brother
can't see you.

378
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:07,569
Does he know what you're doing to me?

379
00:33:07,695 --> 00:33:09,154
Not again, Jesus!

380
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:11,824
- Does he know?
- He's known since the beginning!

381
00:33:11,949 --> 00:33:13,117
Yeah, I'll bet!

382
00:33:13,242 --> 00:33:15,577
I'm sick of having
the same fucking fight!

383
00:33:15,703 --> 00:33:18,205
- You're a fucking liar!
- I'm not fucking lying!

384
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:22,251
Enough already! Fucking hell!
We're trying to help you!

385
00:33:22,376 --> 00:33:27,089
Well, I don't want your help!
I don't want your money!

386
00:33:27,214 --> 00:33:28,340
You fucking need me!

387
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:31,093
You'd be on the street
if it wasn't for me!

388
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:34,805
- You'd be living in a fucking dump!
- Fuck off, you little shit!

389
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:47,693
Go fuck yourself!

390
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:02,499
<i>I missed you this weekend.
Did you miss me?</i>

391
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,209
<i>I wouldn't say "missed."</i>

392
00:34:07,421 --> 00:34:10,049
God! Not the ribs, please!

393
00:34:12,468 --> 00:34:13,844
I love you.

394
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:29,151
Did you pick up the wine?

395
00:34:32,613 --> 00:34:34,114
What wine?

396
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,824
For Martine's.

397
00:34:38,202 --> 00:34:41,038
It totally slipped my mind.
It's tonight?

398
00:34:41,163 --> 00:34:43,248
It's fine.
I'll go while you shower.

399
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:51,298
- Is Max gonna be there?
- I don't know. Ask him.

400
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:55,928
Why? Did you guys fight?

401
00:34:56,053 --> 00:34:58,097
No, I was just wondering.

402
00:34:58,222 --> 00:34:59,556
OK, get in the shower.

403
00:35:11,318 --> 00:35:13,195
Hey, Julien! It's me.
How's it going?

404
00:35:14,655 --> 00:35:16,323
Why are you speaking English?

405
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:26,625
Hey, Julien! It's me.

406
00:35:29,753 --> 00:35:34,007
Nice message.
I don't even recognize your voice.

407
00:35:35,008 --> 00:35:37,177
Listen, I just left Mom's place.

408
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:40,722
I thought you should know

409
00:35:40,848 --> 00:35:44,309
that she's been clean six months.

410
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:45,978
So, that's...

411
00:35:46,395 --> 00:35:50,190
I mean, she's making progress.

412
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:56,280
Anyway, I don't know
if you have plans next weekend,

413
00:35:56,405 --> 00:36:01,201
but I was thinking we'd do a dinner
or go to a restaurant for Mom's birthday.

414
00:36:01,702 --> 00:36:05,706
I'm sure if you came
all the way from New Haven,

415
00:36:05,831 --> 00:36:09,459
she'd be really happy to see you.

416
00:36:10,878 --> 00:36:13,255
Get off the phone, asshole!

417
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:25,679
My God! He's not kidding around, huh?

418
00:38:26,346 --> 00:38:30,142
I bet the Brit kids at school
aren't half as good!

419
00:38:30,267 --> 00:38:32,436
He's in a jazz band.

420
00:38:32,561 --> 00:38:35,689
Well, <i>was.</i>
He didn't like it. Right, Marco?

421
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:38,817
Ma! You nag me to play
and now you won't shut up!

422
00:38:38,942 --> 00:38:42,279
My God! Forgive us, Amadeus!

423
00:38:42,404 --> 00:38:44,906
We'll be as quiet as mice.

424
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:49,953
Mice!

425
00:38:57,711 --> 00:39:00,047
What was he doing in a jazz band?

426
00:39:00,172 --> 00:39:01,131
Beats me!

427
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:02,758
I can hear you!

428
00:39:06,428 --> 00:39:09,264
The latecomers have arrived!

429
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:11,975
The latecomer.
Sarah has nothing to do with it.

430
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,852
Sarah, sweetie! How are you?

431
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:15,562
Here we go again!

432
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:17,230
You were late for 20 years,

433
00:39:17,356 --> 00:39:20,275
and now that I've moved out,
you're early everywhere.

434
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,027
You <i>are</i> always early, Francine!

435
00:39:22,986 --> 00:39:27,491
Colette Kostopoulos, only a traitor
like you could aim so low!

436
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:31,370
Who am I playing for?

437
00:39:34,414 --> 00:39:36,500
Did you have to get it everywhere?

438
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,710
It's part of my new look.

439
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:40,837
Love it.

440
00:39:46,426 --> 00:39:49,221
Why do you check your watch
when there's a clock there?

441
00:39:49,346 --> 00:39:52,349
Why'd you put a white cap
on your bleeding ass?

442
00:39:54,351 --> 00:39:57,104
My head, not my ass.

443
00:39:58,397 --> 00:39:59,523
- Stop it.
- It stings!

444
00:39:59,648 --> 00:40:00,982
It's supposed to.

445
00:40:02,818 --> 00:40:06,279
What are you gonna do when you
fuck up your face in Australia?

446
00:40:06,405 --> 00:40:07,906
Stop it!

447
00:40:09,116 --> 00:40:10,826
I won't fuck up my face.

448
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:14,663
I didn't fuck up my face.
I felled.

449
00:40:15,455 --> 00:40:18,125
Fell. I fell.

450
00:40:22,212 --> 00:40:23,964
What are you gonna do over there?

451
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:30,971
Like, in general or day-to-day?

452
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:32,681
I don't know. Both.

453
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:40,355
I'm gonna find a job. What else?

454
00:40:41,898 --> 00:40:43,483
You have a job here.

455
00:40:44,484 --> 00:40:47,028
Aren't you thriving
in this bar with me?

456
00:40:50,657 --> 00:40:53,702
The bloody sweater looks pretty trashy.

457
00:40:53,827 --> 00:40:56,163
Grab something from Éric's locker.

458
00:41:00,834 --> 00:41:05,630
You got plans on Friday? Night.

459
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:10,760
Depends. I finish Caro's shift.
Bitch has to leave at midnight.

460
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:16,349
'Cause my friend Shariff
is throwing a party.

461
00:41:16,475 --> 00:41:18,727
Everyone's gonna be there.

462
00:41:20,562 --> 00:41:22,856
Would it be, like, a date?

463
00:41:23,899 --> 00:41:25,692
No, I just need a ride.

464
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:27,903
Yes, a date!

465
00:41:32,741 --> 00:41:37,037
So, I'd spend my Friday night
getting punched in the jugs

466
00:41:37,162 --> 00:41:39,831
by a bunch of bros
playing shitty word games?

467
00:41:40,373 --> 00:41:41,958
Pretty much, yeah.

468
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:46,129
- Interested?
- Who wouldn't be?

469
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:50,133
Yeah, I'll be there.

470
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:59,226
<i>- One goddamn stupid cow!
- You couldn't have known!</i>

471
00:41:59,351 --> 00:42:02,187
Jean-Marc told me:
"My new boss is Jamaican.

472
00:42:02,312 --> 00:42:04,022
"We call her Ilsa the She-Wolf,

473
00:42:04,147 --> 00:42:05,440
She dresses like a nun."

474
00:42:05,565 --> 00:42:09,694
So I'm warning the guests and Jocelyn,
who had brought his new girlfriend.

475
00:42:09,819 --> 00:42:11,655
Tall, gorgeous girl.

476
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:12,781
Legs up to here.

477
00:42:12,906 --> 00:42:15,367
And I'm going on and on.

478
00:42:15,492 --> 00:42:20,497
"Jean-Marc's boss dresses like a nun.
She's more Catholic than the pope."

479
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:23,041
- It was her!
- It was her!

480
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:26,086
Get out of here!
Lock her up and throw away the key!

481
00:42:26,211 --> 00:42:27,295
I'm telling you!

482
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:30,549
It wasn't Jocelyn's new girlfriend.
It was the She-Wolf!

483
00:42:30,674 --> 00:42:33,093
- That devil!
- They showed up at the same time.

484
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:34,970
And she just sat there listening!

485
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:42,310
Listen, Jamaican, my ass!
I'm more tanned than she is.

486
00:42:42,435 --> 00:42:43,687
She was white as snow!

487
00:42:43,812 --> 00:42:46,773
- It's true!
- She was! You were there!

488
00:42:53,029 --> 00:42:54,739
It's an assignment.

489
00:42:54,864 --> 00:42:55,824
Really?

490
00:42:55,949 --> 00:43:00,537
Yes! To shoot a short film.
Around the theme "Who am I?"

491
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:07,752
My God, Erika!
You really have a great eye.

492
00:43:07,877 --> 00:43:09,254
Seriously, guys, quiet.

493
00:43:09,379 --> 00:43:11,172
Yeah, we'll miss all the dialogue.

494
00:43:31,192 --> 00:43:33,820
- Are those sunflowers?
- Daisies.

495
00:43:39,326 --> 00:43:41,995
- Are the swings non-binary?
- Die.

496
00:43:42,537 --> 00:43:45,206
I'm serious.
They don't have a penis or vagina?

497
00:43:45,915 --> 00:43:47,292
LIMBO

498
00:43:47,417 --> 00:43:50,086
Well...

499
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:51,630
Very nice!

500
00:43:56,509 --> 00:43:59,429
So, the grading
and sound mixing aren't done,

501
00:43:59,554 --> 00:44:02,682
and Matisse hasn't done
the end credits and shit yet, but...

502
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:06,436
Congrats, Erika!
It was beautiful.

503
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:09,773
It was very captivating.
I was captivated.

504
00:44:09,898 --> 00:44:13,860
Yes, hats off, Erika!
Hell of an assignment you got!

505
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:16,696
I don't know about you guys,
but I was getting hot!

506
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:18,406
I'm so proud of you, sweetie!

507
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:21,326
You have a gift.
You should believe in yourself more.

508
00:44:21,451 --> 00:44:24,454
A gift for using five English words
in a six-word sentence.

509
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:26,289
Shut up, you fucking trash!

510
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:29,459
Erika! Marc-Antoine,
be nice to your sister!

511
00:44:29,584 --> 00:44:32,253
You didn't tell me you were in her film.
That's cool!

512
00:44:32,379 --> 00:44:34,172
I didn't think anyone would see it.

513
00:44:34,297 --> 00:44:35,674
It was great!

514
00:44:38,051 --> 00:44:39,260
- You OK?
- Yeah.

515
00:44:39,386 --> 00:44:41,137
- Did you go smoke?
- Yeah.

516
00:44:41,262 --> 00:44:42,430
It's a metaphor.

517
00:44:42,555 --> 00:44:45,809
- It was very sensual.
- Absolutely.

518
00:44:45,934 --> 00:44:48,395
The color of the shirt,
that, um...

519
00:44:49,145 --> 00:44:50,188
Tomato red!

520
00:44:50,313 --> 00:44:51,564
It was very moving.

521
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:54,734
Very, very Eldomóvar!

522
00:45:02,158 --> 00:45:05,495
OK, who wants a lemon water?
I'll go make some.

523
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:07,706
- I'll have one!
- I can do it!

524
00:45:07,831 --> 00:45:11,418
You stay right there!
It's your night!

525
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,461
If you insist.

526
00:45:14,421 --> 00:45:16,089
Our little boys, all grown up!

527
00:45:16,214 --> 00:45:18,091
Those two have done it all.

528
00:45:18,216 --> 00:45:19,926
Yeah, and our dear Max...

529
00:45:21,094 --> 00:45:23,054
- What a life!
- I know. Shush.

530
00:45:23,179 --> 00:45:25,640
You didn't tell me, Matt!
What a lovely film!

531
00:45:25,765 --> 00:45:27,517
You killed it, Matt, for real.

532
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:30,770
You could have told me!
Why didn't you wait?

533
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:32,313
I couldn't find you.

534
00:45:32,439 --> 00:45:36,776
But it's, like, a minute long.
I can play it again if you want.

535
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:39,696
What, you didn't like it?
It was good!

536
00:45:39,821 --> 00:45:42,532
I just didn't know
we were doing the big premiere!

537
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:46,077
Come on! It's just us.

538
00:45:46,202 --> 00:45:48,621
And Erika's so proud of her film.
Right, sweetie?

539
00:45:48,747 --> 00:45:51,624
- You really killed it, Matt, seriously.
- It was very good!

540
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:53,460
It was good, Erika, but...

541
00:45:53,585 --> 00:45:55,754
You agreed to be in a film.
That's showbiz!

542
00:45:55,879 --> 00:45:59,883
First off, I didn't agree to...
Explain it instead of just sitting there.

543
00:46:00,008 --> 00:46:03,344
Me? You explain it.

544
00:46:03,470 --> 00:46:05,346
There's nothing to explain, babe.

545
00:46:05,472 --> 00:46:08,057
Don't call me "babe."
Sorry, I just...

546
00:46:11,436 --> 00:46:15,732
Colette Kostopoulos!
You better not forget my lemon water!

547
00:46:15,857 --> 00:46:17,525
It's coming!

548
00:46:18,818 --> 00:46:22,447
Martine, what the heck is that kettle?

549
00:46:22,572 --> 00:46:24,157
You got a screw loose or what?

550
00:46:24,949 --> 00:46:25,909
What?

551
00:46:26,034 --> 00:46:28,787
Come on, Colette! That's not a kettle.
It's an air purifier.

552
00:46:31,039 --> 00:46:32,457
That's the kettle!

553
00:46:36,836 --> 00:46:38,588
Mind if I put on some music?

554
00:46:39,088 --> 00:46:41,382
Suits the mood.

555
00:47:22,674 --> 00:47:25,802
Can I come to your girls' night tomorrow?

556
00:47:27,303 --> 00:47:29,097
It's your house too, Matt.

557
00:47:32,475 --> 00:47:35,979
Did you ask your mom
what we should bring Friday?

558
00:47:38,231 --> 00:47:41,192
What we should bring to eat on Friday.

559
00:47:41,901 --> 00:47:43,152
What's on Friday?

560
00:47:45,071 --> 00:47:46,531
Her garden party.

561
00:47:46,656 --> 00:47:49,325
Is there a garden-party festival
and no one told me?

562
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:53,413
A festival of garden parties
you forget about. It's in full swing.

563
00:47:54,247 --> 00:47:55,748
What's it for again?

564
00:47:57,792 --> 00:48:00,044
Hello? What for?

565
00:48:01,129 --> 00:48:03,089
Max's going-away party?

566
00:48:04,132 --> 00:48:05,592
Oh yeah.

567
00:48:05,925 --> 00:48:08,177
Yeah, I knew that.

568
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:12,015
Yeah, yeah.

569
00:48:12,765 --> 00:48:14,225
I'll ask her.

570
00:48:30,283 --> 00:48:33,745
We won't smoke outside like beasts!
I'll open the window.

571
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:35,371
Isn't that nice?

572
00:48:39,792 --> 00:48:42,629
Nervous? The big adventure!

573
00:48:47,675 --> 00:48:49,427
Seeing anyone these days?

574
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:52,555
You?

575
00:48:52,847 --> 00:48:54,474
God!

576
00:48:55,391 --> 00:48:58,478
That train's left the station, hun.

577
00:48:58,603 --> 00:49:00,563
Why? You're pretty!

578
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:03,942
- You are!
- That's nice of you to say.

579
00:49:04,067 --> 00:49:07,070
You've always been nice.
That's your problem. Nice guys...

580
00:49:07,654 --> 00:49:10,698
People don't trust them.
I don't know why.

581
00:49:10,823 --> 00:49:13,034
That's just the way it is! Too bad.

582
00:49:13,701 --> 00:49:16,704
But you'll find someone, I'm sure!

583
00:49:25,088 --> 00:49:26,464
Look...

584
00:49:30,802 --> 00:49:33,054
This is all the paperwork...

585
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:34,472
Yeah.

586
00:49:34,597 --> 00:49:37,225
...for the meeting next week.

587
00:49:37,976 --> 00:49:40,395
We have to go back to the notary

588
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:43,147
to make you the official
subrogate guardian.

589
00:49:43,272 --> 00:49:46,150
Oh my! Subro-what?
Whatchacallit?

590
00:49:46,275 --> 00:49:48,820
Subrogate. Subrogate guardian.

591
00:49:48,945 --> 00:49:51,823
Oh lordy!
We're not messing around!

592
00:49:52,782 --> 00:49:55,159
OK, I got time for another smoke.

593
00:49:55,284 --> 00:49:57,203
Subrogate.

594
00:50:00,123 --> 00:50:01,791
Let me take a look.

595
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:03,835
- No, it's...
- Let's see.

596
00:50:04,252 --> 00:50:08,381
It's just a bunch of papers
with details about the guardianship

597
00:50:08,506 --> 00:50:10,717
and the transfer of property and all that.

598
00:50:11,718 --> 00:50:12,802
Goddammit!

599
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:15,805
Account statements,
bank stuff, you know?

600
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:17,640
There's a shitload, eh...

601
00:50:17,765 --> 00:50:22,937
Basically says you'll be
responsible for her money.

602
00:50:23,521 --> 00:50:25,606
For everything.

603
00:50:26,441 --> 00:50:28,234
You'll be her guardian.

604
00:50:32,405 --> 00:50:34,949
She's not always easy, but...

605
00:50:35,074 --> 00:50:36,576
Yeah.

606
00:50:38,244 --> 00:50:40,038
What's that on your forehead?

607
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:41,914
It's nothing.

608
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:46,294
You should see the other guy!

609
00:50:46,961 --> 00:50:49,422
Small but terrible!
Ya little thug!

610
00:50:52,884 --> 00:50:55,261
Oh my! Lunch break's almost over.

611
00:50:55,386 --> 00:50:58,389
Time flies when you're a subrogate!

612
00:50:58,514 --> 00:51:01,017
Don't wanna be late
on my last day!

613
00:51:01,142 --> 00:51:04,729
OK, what am I forgetting?
There's always something.

614
00:51:04,854 --> 00:51:07,982
- Your smokes.
- Yes. And paperwork's there...

615
00:51:08,733 --> 00:51:10,985
Quick, 'cause I'm late.

616
00:51:11,402 --> 00:51:14,697
OK, Ginette! Back to the office.

617
00:51:15,156 --> 00:51:20,119
A young lawyer from Hartley-Himelstein
will be visiting this week.

618
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:21,788
Yes, from Toronto.

619
00:51:21,913 --> 00:51:24,749
That's right! His name is...

620
00:51:24,874 --> 00:51:27,835
I had it two minutes ago.
On the tip of my tongue.

621
00:51:29,253 --> 00:51:30,254
McAfee.

622
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:33,758
Mr. McAfee.

623
00:51:33,883 --> 00:51:38,179
He's coming Friday
to have a look around,

624
00:51:38,304 --> 00:51:40,973
check out our firm.

625
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:46,395
It's pretty straightforward.
Take him out, woo him.

626
00:51:46,521 --> 00:51:51,317
Pasta at the trattoria,
a single malt downtown.

627
00:51:51,776 --> 00:51:56,405
A cappuccino at McCafé.
And wham!

628
00:51:56,531 --> 00:51:59,826
Make sure he tells his bosses
to come see us next week.

629
00:52:01,244 --> 00:52:03,121
I'll get you the details:

630
00:52:03,246 --> 00:52:06,582
flight number, arrival time, hotel...

631
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:11,671
Let me just find it.

632
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:15,591
I'm counting on you
to show him a good time.

633
00:53:11,814 --> 00:53:13,608
Watch out for the car!

634
00:53:14,525 --> 00:53:15,735
Good thing you're here!

635
00:54:29,558 --> 00:54:32,395
ONE WEEK TO DEPARTURE

636
00:54:48,911 --> 00:54:53,207
Rivette's mom is getting rid of the dryer
at her cottage.

637
00:54:54,083 --> 00:54:58,129
Rivette said she'd come up with a price,
but I think she'll just give it to us.

638
00:55:02,258 --> 00:55:03,759
Fucking hell!

639
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:07,638
Tough noggin you got.
It busted the remote.

640
00:55:08,472 --> 00:55:10,766
I didn't mean to hit your forehead.

641
00:55:12,435 --> 00:55:13,936
Did you eat?

642
00:55:16,939 --> 00:55:18,232
Did you eat this morning?

643
00:55:18,357 --> 00:55:20,776
Yeah, I ate.

644
00:55:22,361 --> 00:55:25,698
Well, answer my question!
I'm not psychic.

645
00:55:26,532 --> 00:55:29,827
I just told you I ate breakfast!
What do you want from me?

646
00:55:32,371 --> 00:55:34,457
You got plans for lunch?

647
00:55:37,418 --> 00:55:39,420
I could make my Swiss Wagon-Wheel pie.

648
00:55:40,755 --> 00:55:43,799
Remember when you and your brother
would get home from school?

649
00:55:43,924 --> 00:55:46,761
- You'd smell it, and—
- I was there. I remember.

650
00:55:56,937 --> 00:56:01,692
You need pie crust to make that.
And ham and broccoli.

651
00:56:01,817 --> 00:56:03,778
I didn't buy any of that stuff.

652
00:56:04,403 --> 00:56:07,406
There's no time to make that.
What's the point anyway?

653
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:10,534
I just want to do something nice for you.
Is that allowed?

654
00:56:14,497 --> 00:56:17,083
Can't we even try anymore?

655
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:26,258
You don't have to make Swiss pie.
Who am I, the Princess of Monaco?

656
00:56:31,055 --> 00:56:32,807
You tell me.

657
00:57:13,347 --> 00:57:14,640
Jesus!

658
00:57:54,513 --> 00:57:55,639
Let's go!

659
00:57:58,517 --> 00:58:00,936
My French is terrible,
but I speak it a little.

660
00:58:24,835 --> 00:58:26,420
Do you like it?

661
00:58:27,004 --> 00:58:28,506
Yeah.

662
00:58:29,548 --> 00:58:31,842
I can't read your mind, you know.

663
00:58:35,554 --> 00:58:36,555
It's good.

664
00:58:43,562 --> 00:58:46,190
Have you... I, uh... Shit!

665
00:58:46,315 --> 00:58:50,653
I left a message,
or tried to leave a message for Julien.

666
00:58:51,654 --> 00:58:53,030
Yesterday.

667
00:58:53,364 --> 00:58:56,700
Have you heard his new
voicemail message?

668
00:58:58,160 --> 00:58:59,662
He just changed it.

669
00:58:59,787 --> 00:59:01,830
You know, the recorded message on the—

670
00:59:01,956 --> 00:59:03,332
Yeah, I know what you mean.

671
00:59:03,457 --> 00:59:04,416
Right.

672
00:59:04,542 --> 00:59:08,504
I haven't called in a while.
He never calls back, so...

673
00:59:15,469 --> 00:59:19,348
Anyway, I think...

674
00:59:19,473 --> 00:59:22,476
I think you might find it funny.

675
00:59:22,601 --> 00:59:24,103
His message.

676
00:59:24,812 --> 00:59:26,855
He's joking around.
It's a prank.

677
00:59:30,359 --> 00:59:31,777
It's ringing.

678
00:59:33,112 --> 00:59:34,697
He won't answer.

679
00:59:41,078 --> 00:59:42,496
I don't understand English.

680
00:59:43,706 --> 00:59:45,833
Listen. You're supposed to...

681
00:59:45,958 --> 00:59:47,710
You kids all speak English now.

682
00:59:47,835 --> 00:59:49,962
Just listen!

683
00:59:52,965 --> 00:59:54,800
Anyways, it's...

684
00:59:55,509 --> 00:59:58,846
The idea is...

685
00:59:59,972 --> 01:00:04,476
You think he answered,
but it's actually just a message.

686
01:00:33,464 --> 01:00:35,299
OK, give me back the money.

687
01:00:39,553 --> 01:00:41,889
Give it back before you go.

688
01:00:42,014 --> 01:00:43,891
I've changed. I'm doing fine.

689
01:00:46,143 --> 01:00:47,645
I'm fine.

690
01:00:51,565 --> 01:00:54,902
What are you doing?

691
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:58,656
- Come on.
- What the fuck am I doing here?

692
01:00:58,781 --> 01:01:02,159
OK, come on. Sit down.

693
01:01:02,284 --> 01:01:05,412
We can talk. We're adults.

694
01:01:05,913 --> 01:01:07,873
Come on! Sit down a minute.

695
01:01:07,998 --> 01:01:09,833
We can't fight like this forever.

696
01:01:09,958 --> 01:01:12,586
It's gonna take
a lot of fucking Swiss pies!

697
01:01:12,711 --> 01:01:14,838
I'm not giving you the money. Got it?

698
01:01:14,963 --> 01:01:16,799
You'll have to kill me first.

699
01:01:20,302 --> 01:01:22,888
- What are you doing here?
- What the fuck?

700
01:01:24,723 --> 01:01:27,267
Calm down!

701
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:34,191
Fucking hell!

702
01:01:35,442 --> 01:01:38,278
That's it, go hide!
I've seen that one before.

703
01:01:38,404 --> 01:01:41,448
Max hiding in the washroom!
Max hiding in the closet!

704
01:01:41,573 --> 01:01:42,908
Shut up!

705
01:01:44,743 --> 01:01:46,328
You shut up!

706
01:01:52,292 --> 01:01:54,378
You OK, little girl?

707
01:01:55,045 --> 01:01:59,258
Is she crying?
Is my little girl crying?

708
01:03:22,341 --> 01:03:24,551
Am I boring you, my friend?

709
01:03:30,599 --> 01:03:33,519
We can speak French if it's easier.

710
01:03:33,644 --> 01:03:37,064
I'm just worried about being late.

711
01:03:37,189 --> 01:03:38,816
Late for what?

712
01:03:45,572 --> 01:03:47,074
You're close?

713
01:04:39,418 --> 01:04:42,254
OK, veggies are in the garage fridge.

714
01:04:42,379 --> 01:04:45,883
Sauce, check. Crab dip, check.

715
01:04:47,801 --> 01:04:50,637
Could you write any smaller,
Francine Lamy?

716
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:59,771
You're always looking for trouble!

717
01:05:03,066 --> 01:05:05,360
I made you sloppy joes, Max!

718
01:05:05,485 --> 01:05:08,071
I know, Francine. Thank you!
You didn't have to!

719
01:05:08,196 --> 01:05:10,657
- Oh, please! Don't be silly!
- No, but...

720
01:05:10,782 --> 01:05:13,660
And you better get 'em while you can!

721
01:05:13,785 --> 01:05:16,538
I'm sure sloppy joes
don't grow on trees in Oceania!

722
01:05:17,623 --> 01:05:20,375
Oceania! Just south of Indochina,
right, Francine?

723
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:22,920
The Rivette-o-thon,
ladies and gents!

724
01:05:23,045 --> 01:05:27,466
Should I pop by the package store,
get a couple barrels of bourbon?

725
01:05:27,591 --> 01:05:29,718
Fuck off, princess!

726
01:05:31,970 --> 01:05:34,264
Come give me a hand, princess!

727
01:05:34,389 --> 01:05:37,017
Life goes on when you stop your babbling!

728
01:05:37,559 --> 01:05:39,061
Come on, get over here!

729
01:05:39,186 --> 01:05:41,146
Give me a minute.

730
01:05:47,903 --> 01:05:49,071
Fuck, I'm beat!

731
01:05:49,196 --> 01:05:51,573
An hour late,
and you're "beat"?

732
01:05:51,698 --> 01:05:55,369
You didn't inherit
your father's gift for excuses!

733
01:05:55,494 --> 01:05:57,537
I texted you!
The matriarch's lament...

734
01:05:57,663 --> 01:06:02,000
The matriarch was slaving away cooking!
Didn't have time for texts and games.

735
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:04,920
Why buy a phone
if you leave it in your room?

736
01:06:05,504 --> 01:06:07,339
Don't start, Internet generation!

737
01:06:07,464 --> 01:06:09,132
You made it!

738
01:06:09,257 --> 01:06:10,926
We had lost hope.

739
01:06:11,051 --> 01:06:13,095
- You OK?
- It was the guy from Toronto.

740
01:06:13,220 --> 01:06:14,805
I had no choice. It went late.

741
01:06:14,930 --> 01:06:18,100
"I had no choice,"
close relative of "It's not my fault."

742
01:06:18,225 --> 01:06:20,936
- When one's around, the other's not far.
- Back off!

743
01:06:21,061 --> 01:06:23,689
Max has been twiddling his thumbs
for an hour.

744
01:06:23,814 --> 01:06:26,817
That's his problem!
He can talk. He has a tongue!

745
01:06:26,942 --> 01:06:28,860
He loosens up when you're there.

746
01:06:28,986 --> 01:06:31,530
Do you have his
letter of recommendation?

747
01:06:31,655 --> 01:06:33,240
- What letter?
- Enough, OK?

748
01:06:33,365 --> 01:06:37,244
Apparently, employers in Sydney
are asking for it.

749
01:06:37,369 --> 01:06:39,079
I know, but it's not my fault.

750
01:06:39,746 --> 01:06:40,831
"Not my fault."

751
01:06:41,415 --> 01:06:42,749
<i>Three delivery attempts.</i>

752
01:06:42,874 --> 01:06:47,838
I went all the way to the warehouse,
and the package is out for delivery.

753
01:06:47,963 --> 01:06:48,964
I was there!

754
01:06:49,089 --> 01:06:52,509
I want all the secret keepers
in the kitchen! Thank you!

755
01:06:52,634 --> 01:06:57,139
Yes! And just to be clear,
we're talking about the book <i>The Secret.</i>

756
01:06:57,264 --> 01:06:59,599
Is there a power switch on this yap?

757
01:06:59,725 --> 01:07:01,268
Nope!

758
01:07:01,393 --> 01:07:02,644
OK, so now...

759
01:07:02,769 --> 01:07:05,313
- What are we doing?
- Come closer, Matthias!

760
01:07:05,439 --> 01:07:07,149
Yay! We're whispering!

761
01:07:07,274 --> 01:07:11,486
So you'll talk first,
give your little speech.

762
01:07:13,864 --> 01:07:15,407
Yes, I'll talk. Then what?

763
01:07:15,532 --> 01:07:19,369
OK, speech,
then give him the hoodie first.

764
01:07:19,494 --> 01:07:23,081
'Cause the iPad is more...
You know.

765
01:07:23,665 --> 01:07:26,084
After the gifts, berry cake!

766
01:07:26,209 --> 01:07:27,627
OK, but what berries?

767
01:07:27,753 --> 01:07:29,755
Strawberries, raspberries, blueberries...

768
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:32,049
Which part of berry is unclear?
OK, go!

769
01:07:37,054 --> 01:07:39,306
- It was broken.
- Come on!

770
01:07:40,515 --> 01:07:42,476
- Excuse me!
- No!

771
01:07:43,477 --> 01:07:45,187
Quiet, little boys!

772
01:07:45,312 --> 01:07:48,732
Well, not so little anymore,
but still my little boys anyway.

773
01:07:48,857 --> 01:07:50,650
And the lovely Sarah.

774
01:07:52,611 --> 01:07:55,197
My dear Maxime!
I know you don't like big speeches.

775
01:07:55,322 --> 01:07:58,366
- No, and yet...
- But you don't have a choice.

776
01:07:58,492 --> 01:08:01,828
You're going away.
You're leaving us.

777
01:08:02,704 --> 01:08:03,830
For two years.

778
01:08:04,915 --> 01:08:08,627
So Matt prepared a little something.

779
01:08:09,795 --> 01:08:10,796
OK!

780
01:08:15,967 --> 01:08:17,636
Well, I don't want to...

781
01:08:18,929 --> 01:08:21,890
I know you don't like...

782
01:08:23,225 --> 01:08:27,813
I know you don't like speeches,
so I'll keep it short and sweet.

783
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:33,401
I...

784
01:08:40,325 --> 01:08:43,453
Probably should have written something.

785
01:08:43,578 --> 01:08:44,579
Well, yeah!

786
01:08:47,958 --> 01:08:50,669
It's gonna be weird not having you around.

787
01:08:52,129 --> 01:08:53,964
But at the same time...

788
01:08:58,426 --> 01:09:00,720
Christ! How should I put this?

789
01:09:03,014 --> 01:09:05,183
It's gonna be weird
not having you around,

790
01:09:06,059 --> 01:09:09,855
but when you come back,
things will be different...

791
01:09:11,022 --> 01:09:13,567
with a new type of energy.

792
01:09:14,359 --> 01:09:16,862
And I'm sure...

793
01:09:18,905 --> 01:09:23,910
I'm sure plenty of great new things
are waiting for you there...

794
01:09:24,744 --> 01:09:27,581
and that it will be very enriching.

795
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:30,375
So, that's it!

796
01:09:33,962 --> 01:09:35,463
And we'll miss you.

797
01:09:35,589 --> 01:09:38,300
I think I speak for all of us
when I say that.

798
01:09:38,425 --> 01:09:39,718
So, to Max!

799
01:09:40,468 --> 01:09:43,013
Well! Not your most eloquent!

800
01:09:43,805 --> 01:09:44,890
OK, to Max!

801
01:09:45,348 --> 01:09:46,892
To Max!

802
01:09:47,017 --> 01:09:49,102
- Cheers, Max!
- Cheers!

803
01:09:50,145 --> 01:09:51,396
To Max!

804
01:09:52,230 --> 01:09:55,483
OK. Gifts!

805
01:09:56,860 --> 01:10:00,822
- What? No! You know I...
- Shut up, Max!

806
01:10:01,656 --> 01:10:02,741
It's beautiful!

807
01:10:02,866 --> 01:10:04,784
You know I hate gifts!

808
01:10:08,997 --> 01:10:13,668
It was perfect, as usual.
Those sloppy joes...

809
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:19,299
Anyway, I'll see you
before you leave on Wednesday.

810
01:10:19,424 --> 01:10:22,886
No, Friday.
I'll come grab the suitcase before.

811
01:10:23,011 --> 01:10:25,513
- Why did I think it was Wednesday?
- It's fine.

812
01:10:26,514 --> 01:10:27,891
This... It's too much.

813
01:10:28,016 --> 01:10:29,559
- Come on!
- It's too much.

814
01:10:29,684 --> 01:10:33,188
Oh, drop it, you ninny!
It was from all of us, by the way!

815
01:10:33,313 --> 01:10:34,314
Thank you.

816
01:10:35,232 --> 01:10:38,276
Max, can you text me Shariff's address
for the GPS?

817
01:10:38,693 --> 01:10:40,820
I left my phone in your car.

818
01:10:40,946 --> 01:10:44,241
Did I hear that right?
Benjamin Shariff?

819
01:10:44,366 --> 01:10:47,369
No, the late actor Omar Sharif.
We're going to his place.

820
01:10:47,494 --> 01:10:52,749
- Yes, Francine, your handsome Shariff.
- Couldn't be bothered to drop by!

821
01:10:52,874 --> 01:10:55,085
He's throwing the party.
Give him a chance.

822
01:10:55,210 --> 01:10:58,797
Still studying?
He'll end up teaching if he keeps it up!

823
01:10:58,922 --> 01:11:00,173
He's a lecturer, now.

824
01:11:00,298 --> 01:11:03,218
There you go!
I wasn't born yesterday!

825
01:11:03,343 --> 01:11:04,427
What was his thesis?

826
01:11:04,552 --> 01:11:08,431
- Give him a call, all right?
- Don't tempt me! Handsome man like that...

827
01:11:08,556 --> 01:11:12,227
Alain Delon meets Peter Sellers
meets a Moroccan.

828
01:11:12,352 --> 01:11:14,521
I've always had a soft spot
for Basque men.

829
01:11:14,646 --> 01:11:16,856
Matt's father!
Handsome Portuguese man...

830
01:11:16,982 --> 01:11:19,401
Wine connoisseur, loud talker!

831
01:11:19,526 --> 01:11:21,319
OK, guys, I'm gonna say bye.

832
01:11:21,444 --> 01:11:22,696
You're not coming?

833
01:11:23,488 --> 01:11:27,575
- But the handsome Benjamin...
- For real, guys, I'm beat.

834
01:11:28,118 --> 01:11:30,370
- I thought you...
- Could you not?

835
01:11:30,495 --> 01:11:32,205
Well, you know what I think!

836
01:11:32,330 --> 01:11:34,916
But I told Félix
you'd star in his student film.

837
01:11:35,041 --> 01:11:36,209
Fuck off!

838
01:11:36,334 --> 01:11:38,003
It was just a joke! Jesus!

839
01:11:38,128 --> 01:11:40,422
What's the deal?
You've known for a while.

840
01:11:40,547 --> 01:11:42,007
It was a long week.

841
01:11:42,132 --> 01:11:43,800
Matt, can I talk to you, please?

842
01:11:44,718 --> 01:11:47,012
Anyway, Max,
I'll see you before you go?

843
01:11:47,137 --> 01:11:48,888
- Yeah, no worries.
- We'll text?

844
01:11:55,729 --> 01:11:58,732
Look, I'll drive you.
Just figure out a way home.

845
01:11:58,857 --> 01:12:00,317
That's not the issue, Sarah.

846
01:12:00,442 --> 01:12:02,736
I'm just not up for it. I'm beat.

847
01:12:02,861 --> 01:12:05,030
Matt, just shut up for two minutes.

848
01:12:05,447 --> 01:12:07,866
It's 7:30!
You're not 100 years old.

849
01:12:07,991 --> 01:12:11,661
You took a lawyer out for pasta.
You didn't translate <i>War and Peace.</i>

850
01:12:16,166 --> 01:12:17,667
I'll go.

851
01:12:18,418 --> 01:12:19,919
I'll wait in the car.

852
01:12:51,868 --> 01:12:54,329
Bordeaux? I'm on the fucking South Shore!

853
01:12:54,454 --> 01:12:57,123
What the hell are you doing, bozo?

854
01:12:57,248 --> 01:12:59,751
I'm taking off these fancy clothes.

855
01:12:59,876 --> 01:13:03,046
Can't stand it.
I just wanted to please Francine.

856
01:13:03,171 --> 01:13:06,091
Tell that to the guy
with little dudes on his shirt.

857
01:13:06,216 --> 01:13:09,594
Fuck off! At least I don't dress
like a minigolf faggot.

858
01:13:10,387 --> 01:13:11,805
A minigolf faggot?

859
01:13:11,930 --> 01:13:13,431
Frank, go back!

860
01:13:13,556 --> 01:13:16,267
- What, me?
- You're Frank, aren't you?

861
01:13:16,393 --> 01:13:18,019
Go back, man! Back.

862
01:13:18,436 --> 01:13:22,023
- Back. That's forward, booby!
- The one that goes...

863
01:13:23,108 --> 01:13:25,693
- Jesus! It's one station!
- Fuck off, Brass!

864
01:13:25,819 --> 01:13:26,861
One station!

865
01:13:26,986 --> 01:13:30,198
It's the song from the time... Sorry.

866
01:13:30,323 --> 01:13:33,952
When we were caked on shrooms
and watched <i>The Barbarian Invasions.</i>

867
01:13:34,077 --> 01:13:38,039
Oh yeah! Off to the cottage
for a formal yak on dick-sucking.

868
01:13:38,164 --> 01:13:41,126
12-letter adjective battles and all!

869
01:13:41,835 --> 01:13:44,087
- I'm trying!
- We're gonna miss it!

870
01:13:44,212 --> 01:13:45,922
That's the one!

871
01:14:01,604 --> 01:14:03,356
Bridge, bridge, bridge!

872
01:14:39,476 --> 01:14:42,145
<i>At a certain point,
you outgrow the jokes and songs.</i>

873
01:14:43,104 --> 01:14:47,775
I'll go tonight, but I just want
to spend more time with you,

874
01:14:47,901 --> 01:14:50,278
take some distance from those guys.

875
01:14:51,279 --> 01:14:54,491
Not everyone, but one or two.

876
01:14:56,159 --> 01:14:58,161
That's the plan, clearly!

877
01:14:59,204 --> 01:15:01,873
Should happen pretty naturally.

878
01:15:04,542 --> 01:15:05,710
OK, but...

879
01:15:05,835 --> 01:15:10,548
I know you were with the lawyer,
but an hour and 15 minutes?

880
01:15:11,174 --> 01:15:15,386
And I know your mom can be difficult,
but you have to understand, Matt.

881
01:15:15,512 --> 01:15:17,972
I don't know if...
Norbert is the next one, right?

882
01:15:18,097 --> 01:15:20,850
- Yeah, but it's—
- Let me finish, Matt!

883
01:15:21,643 --> 01:15:24,354
That speech you just gave for Max...

884
01:15:24,729 --> 01:15:27,482
Do you think it made anyone happy?

885
01:15:29,442 --> 01:15:30,902
And did it ever occur to you

886
01:15:31,027 --> 01:15:34,405
that Max may have been hurt
you didn't want to go tonight?

887
01:15:36,824 --> 01:15:39,369
And I don't...
Left on Jean-Béliveau?

888
01:15:39,494 --> 01:15:42,080
- Yeah, but—
- It's not just me, myself and I.

889
01:15:42,205 --> 01:15:44,832
But it's not always
me, myself and Max, motherfuck!

890
01:15:44,958 --> 01:15:48,586
Why are you saying this now?
Am I on trial or something?

891
01:15:54,008 --> 01:15:55,843
It's because of the film, isn't it?

892
01:15:57,762 --> 01:15:59,973
It's because of the fucking film!

893
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:02,267
That's it, isn't it?

894
01:16:05,436 --> 01:16:07,772
What are you even talking about?

895
01:16:07,897 --> 01:16:10,692
Come on!
Erika's piece-of-shit film.

896
01:16:10,817 --> 01:16:13,069
Sarah, it meant nothing to me!

897
01:16:13,194 --> 01:16:16,406
It was just a bet!
I didn't even wanna do it!

898
01:16:16,531 --> 01:16:17,907
OK?

899
01:16:20,493 --> 01:16:22,579
So just forget about it, and...

900
01:16:23,246 --> 01:16:24,956
Let's just forget about it.

901
01:16:27,917 --> 01:16:30,461
- Right on Notre-Dame?
- Yeah.

902
01:16:58,698 --> 01:17:00,241
Have fun tonight.

903
01:17:25,725 --> 01:17:27,226
Fuck!

904
01:17:32,357 --> 01:17:35,234
<i>OK, fuckers!
Shut up while I explain the rules.</i>

905
01:17:36,653 --> 01:17:38,988
Shariff, it's your house,
but shut up anyway.

906
01:17:39,113 --> 01:17:40,907
- 10 years of friendship.
- Don't care.

907
01:17:41,032 --> 01:17:44,869
Round one: Say anything you want,
but no words from the same family.

908
01:17:44,994 --> 01:17:46,412
By "same family,"

909
01:17:46,537 --> 01:17:50,875
I mean "house" and "household,"
"love" and "lover" and so on.

910
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,001
Round two, one word.

911
01:17:52,919 --> 01:17:54,962
- Brass, you're dead, bitch!
- What?

912
01:17:55,088 --> 01:17:56,255
Round three, mime.

913
01:17:56,381 --> 01:17:58,675
No noise, no sounds.
Right, Brass?

914
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:01,469
Mime! Should we do 30 or 45 seconds?

915
01:18:01,594 --> 01:18:03,638
- 30, right?
- 45!

916
01:18:03,763 --> 01:18:05,390
45! Calm your nipples!

917
01:18:05,515 --> 01:18:09,227
Ladies and gentlemen,
let the games begin!

918
01:20:07,136 --> 01:20:08,346
Runner.

919
01:20:13,726 --> 01:20:14,811
Usain Bolt?

920
01:20:14,936 --> 01:20:16,896
Oh my God, Max!
I feel bad for you.

921
01:20:17,021 --> 01:20:19,649
Shut the fuck up!
It's my turn!

922
01:20:22,819 --> 01:20:25,321
Rivette! Turn around!

923
01:20:25,446 --> 01:20:26,906
He's talking!

924
01:20:28,324 --> 01:20:29,617
He's talking!

925
01:20:29,742 --> 01:20:32,453
It's my turn!
You're making me lose focus!

926
01:20:32,578 --> 01:20:35,122
- Shut up, goddammit!
- I'm allowed to talk!

927
01:20:36,541 --> 01:20:38,167
- He gave his clue.
- I didn't hear.

928
01:20:38,292 --> 01:20:40,294
I know there's another one. Sorry.

929
01:20:41,003 --> 01:20:43,047
- You won't get it.
- Owens. Jess—

930
01:20:43,172 --> 01:20:44,382
Time's up!

931
01:20:47,844 --> 01:20:49,804
It's good! What are you talking about?

932
01:20:49,929 --> 01:20:51,889
Put it back! Too bad!

933
01:20:52,014 --> 01:20:53,349
You didn't say Jesse.

934
01:20:53,474 --> 01:20:55,101
I said Jesse Owens!

935
01:20:56,936 --> 01:20:58,938
- Owens isn't enough of a legend?
- Yes!

936
01:20:59,063 --> 01:21:00,731
Rivette, the timer.

937
01:21:01,566 --> 01:21:02,900
Gimme a sec, Jesus.

938
01:21:05,862 --> 01:21:08,197
- Concentrate.
- Three, two, one, go!

939
01:21:10,867 --> 01:21:12,618
- Throne.
<i>- Game of Thrones.</i>

940
01:21:12,743 --> 01:21:13,995
No talking!

941
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:15,997
- Jon Snow!
- Yes!

942
01:21:16,414 --> 01:21:20,751
Pause it! Rivette, pause it!

943
01:21:22,378 --> 01:21:24,213
What were you telling him, Max?

944
01:21:25,590 --> 01:21:27,800
Me? To Rivette?

945
01:21:27,925 --> 01:21:31,053
Don't play dumb. You were whispering
in his ear for ten seconds.

946
01:21:31,178 --> 01:21:33,222
I'm sure you didn't just forget.

947
01:21:33,723 --> 01:21:36,183
He was talking about Jesse Owens.

948
01:21:36,309 --> 01:21:37,727
Yeah? What about him?

949
01:21:37,852 --> 01:21:40,021
Who cares? Our turn is over.

950
01:21:40,146 --> 01:21:43,107
- Guys, we're here to have fun.
- I'm not talking to you.

951
01:21:43,232 --> 01:21:44,942
Can I just finish my fucking turn?

952
01:21:45,067 --> 01:21:48,237
Fuck off! Sit down and count to ten. Max?

953
01:21:48,362 --> 01:21:49,614
Jesus!

954
01:21:55,995 --> 01:21:57,330
You OK, Matt?

955
01:21:58,164 --> 01:21:59,749
I'm doing great!

956
01:21:59,874 --> 01:22:00,791
You too, right?

957
01:22:00,917 --> 01:22:04,545
Telling Rivette which word
you're gonna use next.

958
01:22:04,670 --> 01:22:06,088
What's your deal?

959
01:22:06,672 --> 01:22:07,673
Go fuck yourself!

960
01:22:09,258 --> 01:22:11,969
- It's fine.
- Shit's getting heavy, man!

961
01:22:12,094 --> 01:22:13,888
Your <i>shirt</i> is heavy.

962
01:22:15,056 --> 01:22:16,182
If you'll allow me,

963
01:22:16,307 --> 01:22:20,269
I'm just gonna add ten points
to make up for the cheating.

964
01:22:20,394 --> 01:22:23,522
Can we all agree on that?
Ten points?

965
01:22:24,857 --> 01:22:25,942
Relax.

966
01:22:26,484 --> 01:22:27,652
I'm very relaxed!

967
01:22:27,777 --> 01:22:31,656
Is ten points too much?
Should we do five?

968
01:22:31,781 --> 01:22:33,157
At least three.

969
01:22:33,282 --> 01:22:35,534
What's your fucking problem?

970
01:22:35,660 --> 01:22:38,329
I don't have one!
I just don't like cheaters.

971
01:22:38,454 --> 01:22:40,831
Stop! I wasn't cheating, OK?

972
01:22:40,957 --> 01:22:42,750
Drop it! You're acting crazy.

973
01:22:42,875 --> 01:22:47,463
Oh, I'm acting crazy?
That's weird, 'cause I feel great!

974
01:22:47,588 --> 01:22:50,841
If you're gonna be like that,
go home and deal with your shit.

975
01:22:50,967 --> 01:22:54,220
I'm sorry you don't understand
the concept of cheating, Frank.

976
01:22:54,345 --> 01:22:56,389
It's out of your range,
intellectually.

977
01:22:57,306 --> 01:23:00,810
Guys, it's a fucking game!
Calm down.

978
01:23:04,522 --> 01:23:06,107
Let it go, Frank.

979
01:23:12,071 --> 01:23:13,572
Guys, seriously.

980
01:23:16,617 --> 01:23:18,995
You're making a fool of yourself, Matt.

981
01:23:19,370 --> 01:23:20,705
Just go home.

982
01:23:37,221 --> 01:23:39,265
Look at me! Stop it!

983
01:23:39,390 --> 01:23:40,683
Let go of him!

984
01:23:41,183 --> 01:23:42,935
Fuck off, ink stain.

985
01:24:13,174 --> 01:24:15,176
Fucking game!

986
01:25:47,101 --> 01:25:51,564
- He can go.
- Yeah, but is it worth it?

987
01:25:51,689 --> 01:25:54,942
Everyone on the planet went but you.

988
01:25:55,734 --> 01:25:57,403
Jesus! He wants to...

989
01:26:01,448 --> 01:26:04,034
- Who's number one?
- Me, fucker!

990
01:26:07,621 --> 01:26:09,748
Where's the frigging lighter?

991
01:26:15,588 --> 01:26:18,507
I don't know, Matt.
Is that lighter in my range?

992
01:26:18,632 --> 01:26:20,050
Intellectually?

993
01:26:21,969 --> 01:26:23,345
Frank, for real...

994
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:26,223
I'm sorry.

995
01:26:27,850 --> 01:26:30,519
For real, I'm sorry.

996
01:26:32,521 --> 01:26:34,899
I'm just fucking with you.
Come here! Relax!

997
01:26:35,024 --> 01:26:36,567
It's so touching!

998
01:26:36,692 --> 01:26:39,361
They fight, but they love each other.

999
01:26:39,486 --> 01:26:41,488
You jealous?
You want a piece of me, babe?

1000
01:26:41,614 --> 01:26:43,699
He's jealous! He told me earlier.

1001
01:26:47,203 --> 01:26:49,121
Stop it! Let go of me!

1002
01:26:49,246 --> 01:26:51,624
- Let go of me, who?
- Let go of me, dickhead!

1003
01:26:52,625 --> 01:26:53,918
Let go, douchebag!

1004
01:26:55,127 --> 01:26:56,754
Let go, Mr. Francis.

1005
01:26:56,879 --> 01:26:58,589
But that's the right answer!

1006
01:27:32,498 --> 01:27:35,459
- It's...
- Whose turn is it?

1007
01:27:36,377 --> 01:27:37,962
Brass, it's your go.

1008
01:27:38,087 --> 01:27:40,756
- Come on!
- He's hiding jokers in his hand!

1009
01:27:42,299 --> 01:27:43,968
- Go, Rivette.
- That's good.

1010
01:27:45,552 --> 01:27:47,304
Your card is good.

1011
01:27:49,139 --> 01:27:50,724
Rivette, come on!

1012
01:27:52,559 --> 01:27:54,645
- It's good, 'cause after—
- Just go.

1013
01:27:54,770 --> 01:27:57,398
Go watch TV in the living room
or something.

1014
01:27:57,523 --> 01:28:00,359
I can't focus
with you breathing down my neck.

1015
01:28:00,484 --> 01:28:02,820
- Rivette, drop it.
- Go, Matt.

1016
01:28:03,487 --> 01:28:06,657
- No. Well, yes and no.
- Go! Play!

1017
01:28:06,782 --> 01:28:08,158
Fucking idiot! Go, man!

1018
01:28:08,284 --> 01:28:11,078
- It's a seven. Not that hard.
- Go, goddammit!

1019
01:28:40,899 --> 01:28:42,401
What?

1020
01:28:43,027 --> 01:28:44,528
Nothing.

1021
01:28:47,531 --> 01:28:49,033
Stop it!

1022
01:29:56,016 --> 01:29:57,101
...your mother's sauce.

1023
01:29:57,226 --> 01:29:59,645
Don't talk about my mother's sauce
in that tone.

1024
01:29:59,770 --> 01:30:01,397
But it's so good.

1025
01:30:01,522 --> 01:30:03,649
I knew it!

1026
01:30:10,364 --> 01:30:13,534
Friends should never discuss
religion, money or their mothers,

1027
01:30:13,659 --> 01:30:15,035
especially not their sauce.

1028
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:16,578
- Whose turn is it?
- Don't laugh!

1029
01:30:16,703 --> 01:30:20,040
You wouldn't like it
if I talked about your mother's sauce.

1030
01:30:24,878 --> 01:30:26,880
Your mother's sauce is so good!

1031
01:35:04,116 --> 01:35:05,867
Stop!

1032
01:35:09,955 --> 01:35:11,248
I don't get it.

1033
01:35:11,540 --> 01:35:13,208
This isn't us.

1034
01:35:20,465 --> 01:35:21,967
Fuck!

1035
01:35:23,510 --> 01:35:25,303
I won't go on Friday.

1036
01:35:25,637 --> 01:35:29,558
I was supposed to leave Friday,
but I'll leave on Sunday.

1037
01:35:30,767 --> 01:35:32,561
Fuck Boston!

1038
01:35:37,566 --> 01:35:39,985
I want us to spend the weekend together.

1039
01:35:40,569 --> 01:35:43,864
I want us to talk.
We have to talk.

1040
01:35:48,785 --> 01:35:50,328
I want to understand.

1041
01:42:35,900 --> 01:42:40,029
ONE DAY TO DEPARTURE

1042
01:42:53,251 --> 01:42:55,128
- Hi, Max!
- Hi!

1043
01:42:55,253 --> 01:42:57,797
You're wearing the nice sweater I got you!

1044
01:43:02,260 --> 01:43:04,762
- Look at all this junk!
- The one at the top?

1045
01:43:04,888 --> 01:43:06,306
Yeah, hang on.

1046
01:43:09,684 --> 01:43:11,936
Good Lord! Hang on a minute.

1047
01:43:14,898 --> 01:43:17,192
I'll just put this back.

1048
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:22,822
OK! We got our workout for the day.

1049
01:43:23,948 --> 01:43:28,578
It's perfect, Francine.
Thank you so much.

1050
01:43:28,703 --> 01:43:31,831
Of course! Don't be silly!

1051
01:43:34,209 --> 01:43:36,211
OK, well, listen...

1052
01:43:36,336 --> 01:43:38,046
- Well...
- I...

1053
01:43:39,255 --> 01:43:42,842
Stay a bit? For some iced tea.

1054
01:43:43,384 --> 01:43:45,637
Although it's not really
the season anymore.

1055
01:43:46,387 --> 01:43:48,348
- It's getting cooler!
- Yeah.

1056
01:43:48,473 --> 01:43:50,808
I have to work later, so...

1057
01:43:55,855 --> 01:43:57,941
How about a nice glass of water?

1058
01:43:58,066 --> 01:43:59,901
Do you drink enough water, Max?

1059
01:44:00,318 --> 01:44:01,778
Do you like water?

1060
01:44:04,197 --> 01:44:05,865
Of course you do!

1061
01:44:12,538 --> 01:44:18,169
Francine, would you mind
giving me the...

1062
01:44:18,294 --> 01:44:23,091
Thank you. The number for your ex?
Ronaldo's number?

1063
01:44:23,549 --> 01:44:27,720
I need a letter of recommendation.

1064
01:44:27,845 --> 01:44:28,888
Of course!

1065
01:44:29,013 --> 01:44:34,102
I asked Matt to ask Mr. Ruiz
to write me a letter of recommendation

1066
01:44:34,227 --> 01:44:36,145
for the summer I worked for him.

1067
01:44:36,271 --> 01:44:37,730
Yes. And Matt...

1068
01:44:38,314 --> 01:44:40,400
He asked his father, didn't he?

1069
01:44:43,027 --> 01:44:44,279
Yes.

1070
01:44:44,570 --> 01:44:48,324
Well, I reminded him a couple times,
but it didn't seem to...

1071
01:44:48,449 --> 01:44:52,996
I know he asked him,
and he was waiting for the letter.

1072
01:44:55,748 --> 01:44:57,542
I'll find it for you.

1073
01:45:00,378 --> 01:45:01,629
Should be in here.

1074
01:45:07,260 --> 01:45:10,680
Hang on a minute. Ronaldo!

1075
01:45:11,806 --> 01:45:13,558
OK, hang on.

1076
01:45:15,476 --> 01:45:17,520
Me and my small writing!

1077
01:45:21,065 --> 01:45:23,526
Did you ask Matt again?

1078
01:45:34,454 --> 01:45:36,873
Must be downstairs.
Hang on a minute.

1079
01:45:42,003 --> 01:45:43,504
Thanks, Francine!

1080
01:46:32,220 --> 01:46:35,390
M AND M'S FARM

1081
01:46:55,493 --> 01:46:59,997
MATT AND MAX'S FARM
MATTHIAS, 7 YEARS OLD

1082
01:47:20,268 --> 01:47:21,602
Goddammit.

1083
01:47:22,603 --> 01:47:25,648
<i>The condo association
never consulted my client...</i>

1084
01:49:04,622 --> 01:49:07,250
You're going to Australia?

1085
01:49:08,376 --> 01:49:09,502
Yeah.

1086
01:49:10,044 --> 01:49:11,337
Jesus Christ!

1087
01:49:12,171 --> 01:49:17,051
Nice beaches, but they won't understand
an effing word you're saying!

1088
01:49:25,226 --> 01:49:26,519
Look...

1089
01:51:15,586 --> 01:51:17,046
You don't know that.

1090
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:23,594
Yep. I finished the cleaning.

1091
01:51:25,554 --> 01:51:27,890
Just gotta zip up my suitcase.

1092
01:51:30,351 --> 01:51:35,106
I'll run out for some coffees,
then we'll head to the airport?

1093
01:54:28,237 --> 01:54:29,738
Jesus!
