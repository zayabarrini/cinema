1
00:02:51,236 --> 00:02:54,576
Ivan and I moved here
a few months ago.

2
00:02:54,656 --> 00:02:56,911
The world was falling apart...

3
00:02:56,992 --> 00:03:00,791
and I wanted to save it
and save myself.

4
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,959
I felt like Noah.

5
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,919
In the coop on my terrace...

6
00:03:05,001 --> 00:03:08,299
I wanted to save
a couple of each species.

7
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,217
Anyway...

8
00:03:11,299 --> 00:03:14,513
I couldn't save
the couple I cared about most--

9
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:16,097
Ivan and me.

10
00:03:16,179 --> 00:03:18,224
Pepa, darling...

11
00:03:18,306 --> 00:03:21,729
I never want to hear you say,
"I'm unhappy. "

12
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,021
Yours, Ivan.

13
00:03:54,177 --> 00:03:56,640
Life means nothing without you.

14
00:03:57,721 --> 00:04:00,018
Will you marry me?

15
00:04:03,353 --> 00:04:06,526
1 ,001 nights
wouldn't be enough.

16
00:04:08,274 --> 00:04:10,654
I can't live without you.

17
00:04:10,735 --> 00:04:13,699
I love you,
desire you, need you.

18
00:04:13,781 --> 00:04:17,246
That night in the jungle
was heaven.

19
00:04:17,284 --> 00:04:20,290
Let's get married again.

20
00:04:20,371 --> 00:04:23,460
You're the geisha of my life.
Sayonara.

21
00:04:25,209 --> 00:04:28,048
With you by my side,
I don't need success.

22
00:04:28,087 --> 00:04:30,884
I'm willing
to accept you as you are.

23
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,640
Baby, some things
are unmistakably American.

24
00:04:38,597 --> 00:04:40,894
I'm all yours.

25
00:04:42,476 --> 00:04:45,649
- I accept you as you are.
- Great.

26
00:04:54,824 --> 00:04:57,495
How many men
have you had to forget?

27
00:04:59,452 --> 00:05:00,914
Say something nice.

28
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:05,878
Lie.

29
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,673
Tell me you've been
waiting for me...

30
00:05:11,382 --> 00:05:13,762
and you'd die
if I didn't return.

31
00:05:16,805 --> 00:05:18,725
Say you still love me
as I love you.

32
00:05:26,982 --> 00:05:28,276
Thanks.

33
00:05:29,359 --> 00:05:31,113
Thanks a lot.

34
00:05:54,177 --> 00:05:56,306
Call these two numbers.

35
00:05:58,139 --> 00:05:59,308
First, I'll call one...

36
00:05:59,349 --> 00:06:01,436
then the other.

37
00:06:08,483 --> 00:06:10,153
Pepa.

38
00:06:10,235 --> 00:06:13,699
Pepa, sweetheart,
did you oversleep?

39
00:06:13,738 --> 00:06:15,952
We started without you.

40
00:06:16,867 --> 00:06:19,832
Listen. Pack all my stuff
in a suitcase.

41
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:22,166
I'm going on a trip tomorrow.

42
00:06:22,206 --> 00:06:24,710
I'll come and pick it up
and say good-bye...

43
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,711
but I'll call you before.

44
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:29,968
If you don't want to see me,
just leave it downstairs.

45
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:33,719
Thanks for being so understanding.

46
00:06:33,802 --> 00:06:35,471
I don't deserve it.

47
00:06:37,806 --> 00:06:39,392
I'll call later, darling.

48
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,814
Ivan?

49
00:06:55,157 --> 00:06:56,617
"EXA." Hello.

50
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,080
Is Ivan there?

51
00:06:59,161 --> 00:07:00,621
He just called me.

52
00:07:00,704 --> 00:07:02,917
Sorry. He just left.

53
00:07:02,999 --> 00:07:07,549
But your director is here
having a fit 'cause you're not here.

54
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:09,631
Yes. Here he is.

55
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,554
I'm sorry, German.

56
00:07:15,595 --> 00:07:19,394
I couldn't sleep,
so I took a pill.

57
00:07:19,474 --> 00:07:23,106
Don't worry. Just come now.

58
00:07:23,186 --> 00:07:24,688
I'll be right there.

59
00:07:24,771 --> 00:07:28,946
I have to stop by
for some test results on my way.

60
00:07:29,026 --> 00:07:31,363
Okay, but make it quick.

61
00:07:32,779 --> 00:07:36,036
Some people are lucky.
I'll call your cab now.

62
00:07:38,535 --> 00:07:40,539
Who wanted a taxi?

63
00:07:41,955 --> 00:07:46,005
Whoever asked for a taxi,
come to the front desk.

64
00:07:46,085 --> 00:07:48,006
Don't smoke...

65
00:07:48,087 --> 00:07:50,801
eat properly,
and you'll be fine.

66
00:08:03,771 --> 00:08:07,694
Mr. Salcedo,
please pick up the telephone.

67
00:08:08,608 --> 00:08:10,529
It's about time. Studio seven.

68
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:12,030
Did Ivan call again?

69
00:08:12,112 --> 00:08:14,492
No. Forget him, honey.

70
00:08:14,572 --> 00:08:16,701
I'm working on it.

71
00:08:16,784 --> 00:08:18,245
Just give me time.

72
00:08:18,327 --> 00:08:20,081
And cut the microphone.

73
00:08:20,162 --> 00:08:23,710
Give me that paper!
Give me that!

74
00:08:40,308 --> 00:08:43,106
- I'm really sorry, guys.
- Okay, let's go.

75
00:08:46,606 --> 00:08:49,070
Arturo, do you take...

76
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,736
Eugenia as your wife...

77
00:08:50,819 --> 00:08:53,740
and promise to be faithful,
for richer or for poorer...

78
00:08:53,823 --> 00:08:56,244
in sickness and in health,
until death do you part?

79
00:08:56,324 --> 00:08:58,579
Yeah, I think so.

80
00:09:01,413 --> 00:09:04,043
And you, Eugenia. Eugenia?

81
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:05,879
Yes, Father?

82
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,797
Do you take Arturo
as your husband?

83
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:10,091
Sure. Of course I do.

84
00:09:11,841 --> 00:09:15,055
What God has united,
let no man tear asunder.

85
00:09:15,136 --> 00:09:17,515
Can we kiss now, Father?

86
00:09:17,597 --> 00:09:20,686
My child, you mustn't trust any man.

87
00:09:20,767 --> 00:09:22,395
Not even my husband?

88
00:09:22,477 --> 00:09:25,232
You can't be too careful.

89
00:09:25,981 --> 00:09:28,486
Fine. We'll check it later.

90
00:09:28,566 --> 00:09:30,320
Roll it.

91
00:09:30,402 --> 00:09:33,033
- You start rehearsing.
- Thank you.

92
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:01,061
Here. Drink.

93
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:02,686
I'm not thirsty.

94
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:04,564
It'll help you to sleep.

95
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:08,612
I already tried it,
and it didn't help.

96
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:11,072
How many men
have you had to forget?

97
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:14,243
As many as the women
you remember.

98
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,784
Don't go.

99
00:10:15,825 --> 00:10:17,244
I haven't moved.

100
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:19,288
Say something nice.

101
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:23,459
What shall I say?

102
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:27,173
Lie. Tell me you've
waited for me forever.

103
00:10:28,254 --> 00:10:30,591
I've waited for you
all these years.

104
00:10:30,673 --> 00:10:33,095
Say you'd die
if I didn't return.

105
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:36,557
I'd have died
if you hadn't returned.

106
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:40,228
Say you still love me
as I love you.

107
00:10:40,308 --> 00:10:43,231
I still love you as you love me.

108
00:10:43,311 --> 00:10:45,691
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

109
00:10:52,028 --> 00:10:54,032
Pepa, are you okay?

110
00:10:55,783 --> 00:10:59,206
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'll be right back.

111
00:11:17,013 --> 00:11:19,142
You've got some nerve.

112
00:11:19,223 --> 00:11:21,436
Call this number, please.

113
00:11:21,517 --> 00:11:23,772
You have no right, Pepa.

114
00:11:23,854 --> 00:11:25,273
Just dial the number.

115
00:11:25,354 --> 00:11:26,774
You're making a fool of yourself.

116
00:11:26,857 --> 00:11:29,487
Well, a little more won't hurt.

117
00:11:29,567 --> 00:11:31,446
- Were you crying?
- Yes.

118
00:11:31,528 --> 00:11:34,994
There! You see? I knew it, Pepa.

119
00:11:35,073 --> 00:11:38,789
Dial! They won't like
you holding up our work.

120
00:11:38,869 --> 00:11:43,461
Yes, right away.
Excuse me! At your service!

121
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,960
My coffee can wait.

122
00:11:45,043 --> 00:11:47,840
I've had enough breakfasts
in my time.

123
00:11:47,921 --> 00:11:49,883
The other woman's number.

124
00:11:49,923 --> 00:11:53,179
She'll never learn. Not her.

125
00:11:53,259 --> 00:11:57,142
She should have by now.
Not her.

126
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:00,142
No way.

127
00:12:02,393 --> 00:12:05,984
- Who's this?
- Pepa Marcos. Is Ivan there?

128
00:12:07,732 --> 00:12:11,365
- Forgive my bothering you.
- I won't forgive you.

129
00:12:11,444 --> 00:12:13,240
I must speak to him. It's urgent.

130
00:12:13,321 --> 00:12:14,740
How dare you call here?

131
00:12:14,824 --> 00:12:18,121
Don't yell at me.
I just had a fainting spell.

132
00:12:18,202 --> 00:12:20,289
I don't care if you drop dead!

133
00:12:20,371 --> 00:12:23,001
Look, Ivan and I are finished.

134
00:12:23,082 --> 00:12:25,419
- Fuck off!
- Fuck off yourself!

135
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:28,881
Just tell him to call me.

136
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,971
Pepa, I didn't know
you had fainted.

137
00:12:34,052 --> 00:12:35,471
Poor thing.

138
00:12:35,553 --> 00:12:37,306
This is too much!

139
00:12:37,388 --> 00:12:39,100
Don't you dare defend her!

140
00:12:39,182 --> 00:12:40,769
- Mom.
- Yes?

141
00:12:40,851 --> 00:12:42,270
We should talk.

142
00:12:42,352 --> 00:12:46,443
Not now. I'm doing my eye lines,
and you make me nervous.

143
00:12:46,523 --> 00:12:48,485
Okay. Then later?

144
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:51,114
Later. Later.

145
00:12:54,197 --> 00:12:55,575
What's wrong?

146
00:12:55,657 --> 00:12:59,875
That bitch Ivan sleeps with
had the nerve to call me.

147
00:12:59,954 --> 00:13:03,127
He should be more discreet.

148
00:13:03,207 --> 00:13:05,712
Why haven't I thrown those out?

149
00:13:05,793 --> 00:13:07,671
Dad wouldn't let you.

150
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:10,466
I could sell them at the store,
you know?

151
00:13:10,548 --> 00:13:12,468
I like wearing them.

152
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:14,470
It's as if time stood still.

153
00:13:14,552 --> 00:13:17,767
Well, it hasn't stood still.

154
00:13:18,765 --> 00:13:22,439
Don't be rude.
Let her wear what she wants.

155
00:13:22,476 --> 00:13:25,441
Go on. Humor her.
She'll never get well.

156
00:13:25,479 --> 00:13:27,442
Let me help you.

157
00:13:27,481 --> 00:13:30,321
- Hold that.
- Let's see. There.

158
00:13:35,574 --> 00:13:37,495
Like it?

159
00:13:37,576 --> 00:13:39,497
You look terrific.

160
00:13:39,578 --> 00:13:43,169
You're a great liar, Dad.
That's why I love you.

161
00:13:45,167 --> 00:13:47,129
You think it's too dark?

162
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:50,343
- No.
- Neither do l.

163
00:13:57,347 --> 00:14:00,394
- Am I interrupting something?
- No. How are you?

164
00:14:00,475 --> 00:14:02,813
- Fine.
- How's the penthouse?

165
00:14:02,853 --> 00:14:06,443
- Are you enjoying it?
- It's great, but I'm here to sublet it.

166
00:14:06,523 --> 00:14:08,652
We'll get a good price for it.

167
00:14:08,691 --> 00:14:12,074
Good. I'll want to rent an apartment.

168
00:14:12,154 --> 00:14:15,077
Can I make a call?
I've been out all day.

169
00:14:15,157 --> 00:14:17,078
What type of apartment?

170
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:20,290
With a terrace, but not so big.

171
00:14:21,872 --> 00:14:24,920
- Yours is number seven Montalban?
- Yes, seventh floor.

172
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,758
220 square yards
including the terrace.

173
00:14:32,843 --> 00:14:36,432
Everybody just loved your scale model.

174
00:14:36,512 --> 00:14:37,932
It turned out well.

175
00:14:38,014 --> 00:14:39,725
The jerk hasn't called.

176
00:14:39,808 --> 00:14:42,814
- How much is that?
- 200 pesetas.

177
00:14:46,857 --> 00:14:50,363
- Is Isabel here?
- She's busy. Can I help you?

178
00:14:50,443 --> 00:14:53,032
- I have to see her.
- One moment.

179
00:14:56,993 --> 00:14:58,120
Hi.

180
00:14:59,036 --> 00:15:01,457
You want to try a facial?

181
00:15:01,538 --> 00:15:04,252
- I can't now.
- It's free.

182
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,629
They're giving a demonstration.

183
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:09,549
I need sleeping pills.

184
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,301
I've run out.

185
00:15:11,382 --> 00:15:15,557
- You have the prescription?
- No. I'll bring it later or tomorrow.

186
00:15:15,636 --> 00:15:17,933
I can't sleep without them.

187
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:20,728
- Okay.
- Thanks.

188
00:15:26,231 --> 00:15:29,696
- She's not much in person.
- She's skinnier than on TV.

189
00:15:48,504 --> 00:15:52,763
Pepa, honey, are you there?

190
00:15:52,842 --> 00:15:55,722
If I can't reach you,
I'm going to get worried.

191
00:15:55,803 --> 00:15:57,223
So am l.

192
00:15:57,305 --> 00:16:01,271
I've had no luck
reaching you today, so--

193
00:16:01,351 --> 00:16:03,104
Well?

194
00:16:03,186 --> 00:16:05,732
I feel you're avoiding me.

195
00:16:06,815 --> 00:16:08,235
Such bullshit.

196
00:16:08,316 --> 00:16:11,072
I'll keep trying until I get you.

197
00:16:11,153 --> 00:16:13,491
- I may get lucky.
- Sure.

198
00:16:13,571 --> 00:16:16,244
I really want to talk to you.

199
00:16:16,325 --> 00:16:19,248
- I miss you.
- I noticed.

200
00:16:19,328 --> 00:16:21,582
Well, take care.

201
00:16:21,664 --> 00:16:23,584
See you later.

202
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,628
Asshole.

203
00:16:58,077 --> 00:17:00,123
This is Juan
at the real estate agency.

204
00:17:00,204 --> 00:17:03,502
Tomorrow I'm sending a couple
to see your apartment.

205
00:17:03,582 --> 00:17:06,129
Try to be there in the morning.
Thank you.

206
00:17:31,069 --> 00:17:32,572
I'm sick of being good.

207
00:18:05,605 --> 00:18:07,609
I shouldn't smoke.

208
00:19:19,975 --> 00:19:22,730
I'm finally getting rid of this shit!

209
00:19:23,812 --> 00:19:26,776
And this dumb flower!

210
00:19:28,317 --> 00:19:31,573
Who'd think of giving a duck
as a present?

211
00:19:31,652 --> 00:19:33,072
Only you.

212
00:19:33,155 --> 00:19:37,330
But now I'll get rid of it all.
And of you!

213
00:20:59,661 --> 00:21:03,169
"Something's come up
that concerns both of us.

214
00:21:03,249 --> 00:21:07,716
I must talk to you before you leave."

215
00:21:39,996 --> 00:21:42,125
Follow that cab!

216
00:21:42,206 --> 00:21:46,130
I thought this only happened
in the movies.

217
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,009
WELCOME TO MAMBO TAXI

218
00:21:52,133 --> 00:21:54,054
MAGAZINES FOR RENT

219
00:21:54,718 --> 00:21:57,516
Help yourself.
It's on the house.

220
00:21:57,597 --> 00:22:00,311
Thanks. Just follow that cab.

221
00:22:00,391 --> 00:22:03,231
Don't worry. It's under control.

222
00:22:04,229 --> 00:22:06,107
Do you mind the Mambo?

223
00:22:06,189 --> 00:22:09,403
I've got everything.
Heavy metal, rock, soul...

224
00:22:09,484 --> 00:22:12,532
cumbias, even sevillanas.

225
00:22:12,612 --> 00:22:15,076
Salsa, techno-pop...

226
00:22:15,157 --> 00:22:16,701
whatever you like.

227
00:22:16,784 --> 00:22:19,288
- You really like Mambo?
- I love Mambo.

228
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:21,624
Yes, the Mambo...

229
00:22:21,705 --> 00:22:24,378
goes best with this decor.

230
00:22:27,086 --> 00:22:29,048
You're that TV actress.

231
00:22:29,088 --> 00:22:33,680
You play the killer's mother.

232
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,431
How about an autograph?

233
00:22:37,596 --> 00:22:40,602
It's for my girlfriend.
Could you make it personal?

234
00:22:40,683 --> 00:22:43,438
- What's her name?
- Azucena.

235
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:48,194
THANK YOU FOR SMOKING

236
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:58,998
- It stopped.
- What's the address?

237
00:22:59,078 --> 00:23:02,710
Thirty-eight Almagro,
but I don't know what floor.

238
00:23:03,748 --> 00:23:05,210
She waved.

239
00:23:06,168 --> 00:23:08,089
She knows we're here.

240
00:23:08,171 --> 00:23:10,091
I don't care.

241
00:23:10,173 --> 00:23:12,260
Where to now?

242
00:23:12,341 --> 00:23:14,554
Montalban, and thank you.

243
00:23:58,389 --> 00:24:01,479
Ladies, there's something
for you to lean on.

244
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:06,194
Hope it does you more good
than it did me.

245
00:24:06,272 --> 00:24:09,445
Here's your food,
and that's to sleep on.

246
00:24:09,484 --> 00:24:12,198
You can shit on it all you like.

247
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:14,952
Hey. Jump here. Jump!

248
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:17,788
She won't jump. She hates it.

249
00:24:17,826 --> 00:24:20,665
Well, back to my waiting.

250
00:24:41,184 --> 00:24:43,355
Number 38 Almagro.

251
00:24:52,029 --> 00:24:54,325
Number 38... Almagro.
Let's see.

252
00:24:54,364 --> 00:24:57,453
Almagro... Almagro...
Almagro.

253
00:24:57,534 --> 00:25:01,041
31 , 32, 33, 34, 35, 38.

254
00:25:02,123 --> 00:25:04,127
410-0430.

255
00:25:05,167 --> 00:25:07,630
Of course!

256
00:25:08,838 --> 00:25:12,888
Of course. It's the same one
who insulted me this morning.

257
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:18,600
Hello.

258
00:25:18,681 --> 00:25:22,940
I'm the mother
of the notorious "Crossroads Killer."

259
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:26,944
When my son comes home
after one of his famous crimes...

260
00:25:27,024 --> 00:25:29,403
his clothes are just filthy.

261
00:25:31,403 --> 00:25:33,616
Where are the clothes
your son wore...

262
00:25:33,697 --> 00:25:35,869
at the time of the murder?

263
00:25:37,201 --> 00:25:40,875
Right here. Sparkling clean.

264
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,629
- No trace of blood.
- Or guts.

265
00:25:45,709 --> 00:25:48,131
Unbelievable.

266
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,801
Ecce Homo. It's unbelievable.

267
00:26:17,785 --> 00:26:21,834
A group of armed Shiites
was captured here in Madrid today....

268
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:25,212
according to police sources.

269
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:30,260
A local Shiite spokesman
living in Madrid...

270
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:35,099
stated that the commando group
was acting on its own...

271
00:26:35,178 --> 00:26:39,520
without any connection
to the Shiite community.

272
00:26:41,351 --> 00:26:43,605
The same police sources...

273
00:26:43,687 --> 00:26:45,942
promise to release
additional information...

274
00:26:46,022 --> 00:26:47,943
within a few hours...

275
00:26:48,024 --> 00:26:51,197
after the interrogations
are completed.

276
00:26:53,196 --> 00:26:55,701
Oh, my book!

277
00:27:22,352 --> 00:27:27,112
Ivan, I have to speak to you.
It's urgent.

278
00:27:27,191 --> 00:27:30,781
Leave a message
telling me where and when.

279
00:27:31,862 --> 00:27:35,035
I'm going out to look for you now. Bye.

280
00:27:38,118 --> 00:27:40,748
It's me-- Candela.
I've got to see you.

281
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:43,668
I'm going out. Call me later.

282
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:47,673
- I'm in trouble.
- So am l. Good-bye.

283
00:27:48,796 --> 00:27:51,718
Pepa! Damn it, I need you!

284
00:29:50,006 --> 00:29:52,344
- Pepa, it's me.
- That woman!

285
00:29:52,425 --> 00:29:54,137
Pepa, answer.

286
00:29:55,887 --> 00:29:58,391
I'm in big trouble.

287
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:05,484
"From your dad,
who doesn't deserve you. Ivan."

288
00:30:08,984 --> 00:30:11,155
- What are you doing?
- Making a phone call.

289
00:30:11,195 --> 00:30:13,199
Well, make it!

290
00:30:14,198 --> 00:30:17,663
- Your mother's too much.
- I'm sorry, Marisa.

291
00:30:17,701 --> 00:30:20,792
- And that slut in the window!
- What slut? Where?

292
00:30:20,871 --> 00:30:24,169
Weren't you going to use the phone?
Why don't you use it?

293
00:30:24,208 --> 00:30:25,753
Let's go.

294
00:30:25,835 --> 00:30:28,549
Gather everything and let's go.

295
00:31:04,375 --> 00:31:06,964
"Something's come up
that concerns us both.

296
00:31:07,044 --> 00:31:11,011
I must talk to you
before you leave."

297
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:13,052
Throw that away!

298
00:31:41,288 --> 00:31:43,584
God, I hope he called.

299
00:31:51,257 --> 00:31:53,678
Pepa, it's 5.:00A.M.

300
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,431
I'm across from your place,
and you're still not home.

301
00:31:59,307 --> 00:32:02,355
I don't know which end is up
anymore!

302
00:32:04,939 --> 00:32:07,318
I can't explain over the phone.

303
00:32:07,398 --> 00:32:08,818
What a pest!

304
00:32:08,901 --> 00:32:11,113
I'll tell you one thing--

305
00:32:11,862 --> 00:32:16,412
I don't understand,
because if you had a problem--

306
00:32:16,492 --> 00:32:19,414
You'll feel guilty about this!

307
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:33,136
- It's you.
- I called a million times.

308
00:32:33,218 --> 00:32:35,138
You're a drag!

309
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:37,266
Don't say that, or I'll leave.

310
00:32:37,347 --> 00:32:39,268
Come on in.

311
00:32:39,349 --> 00:32:41,813
I've been out all night.

312
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:43,312
So have l.

313
00:32:43,395 --> 00:32:44,815
Let's have some coffee.

314
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:48,319
- Going somewhere?
- No. Ivan's leaving me.

315
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,322
- We're doing great.
- My life's a mess.

316
00:32:51,403 --> 00:32:52,823
Mine too.

317
00:32:52,905 --> 00:32:56,287
- Problems at work?
- No. I couldn't tell you on the phone.

318
00:32:56,366 --> 00:32:59,289
The phone! I just ripped it out!

319
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:01,708
Damn! I'll have to call
the phone company.

320
00:33:01,789 --> 00:33:04,460
Can I stay here?

321
00:33:04,542 --> 00:33:06,462
I'm in big trouble, Pepa!

322
00:33:06,544 --> 00:33:10,510
Fix the coffee, then we'll talk.
You're a pain today!

323
00:33:11,674 --> 00:33:13,344
What?

324
00:33:13,426 --> 00:33:16,850
Don't call me a pain!
I'm feeling very vulnerable.

325
00:33:21,894 --> 00:33:23,354
My God.

326
00:33:26,565 --> 00:33:29,613
Looks like the work of terrorists.

327
00:33:30,611 --> 00:33:32,364
Oh, the phone--

328
00:33:34,573 --> 00:33:36,828
This just isn't normal.

329
00:33:38,327 --> 00:33:40,874
God, the cops. I'm dead.

330
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:52,052
Hello.

331
00:33:52,926 --> 00:33:55,180
Open up.
We know you're in there.

332
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:58,184
- What do you want?
- To see the apartment.

333
00:33:58,223 --> 00:33:59,683
- Which one?
- This one.

334
00:33:59,767 --> 00:34:02,521
- Why?
- To rent it.

335
00:34:02,602 --> 00:34:04,941
The real estate agency sent us.

336
00:34:05,022 --> 00:34:06,608
In that case--

337
00:34:08,192 --> 00:34:12,367
Come in. The owner
will be back in a minute.

338
00:34:16,534 --> 00:34:18,454
- Carlos.
- Yes, honey?

339
00:34:18,536 --> 00:34:20,791
It's too high.

340
00:34:20,872 --> 00:34:22,793
Darling, it's a penthouse.

341
00:34:22,874 --> 00:34:25,629
- And expensive.
- Super-expensive.

342
00:34:25,709 --> 00:34:28,423
But it's a great location.

343
00:34:28,462 --> 00:34:32,303
I want a real house,
and this is not a real house.

344
00:34:32,383 --> 00:34:33,970
The girl is right.

345
00:34:34,052 --> 00:34:36,306
Don't call me a girl.

346
00:34:40,392 --> 00:34:42,312
Carlos.

347
00:34:42,394 --> 00:34:43,981
Yes, my love?

348
00:34:44,062 --> 00:34:45,983
You call this great too?

349
00:34:46,064 --> 00:34:47,483
Christ.

350
00:34:51,403 --> 00:34:53,490
Pepa is really something.

351
00:34:53,572 --> 00:34:56,411
Let's go. Come on.

352
00:35:00,413 --> 00:35:03,669
Drop that! You're a cop, right?

353
00:35:03,748 --> 00:35:05,753
My Carlos a cop?
Very funny!

354
00:35:05,835 --> 00:35:07,296
I'm no cop.

355
00:35:07,336 --> 00:35:08,923
Isn't that your father?

356
00:35:09,005 --> 00:35:11,802
Nice people don't touch
what is not theirs.

357
00:35:11,842 --> 00:35:13,303
Why is this here?

358
00:35:13,342 --> 00:35:14,804
I don't know.

359
00:35:14,845 --> 00:35:18,310
- Do you know her?
- That's Pepa.

360
00:35:18,347 --> 00:35:20,143
You know Pepa?

361
00:35:20,183 --> 00:35:22,271
Not personally, no.

362
00:35:22,311 --> 00:35:23,814
Well, here I am.

363
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,985
You know who I am?

364
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:31,155
Did you see the bed?

365
00:35:31,194 --> 00:35:33,825
I think so, ma'am.
You know who I am?

366
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:37,538
Since last night.
But don't call me ma'am.

367
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:40,331
Ivan sent you for his bag?

368
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:43,460
- No, the realtor sent us.
- What a coincidence.

369
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:46,839
I'm glad to meet you anyway.

370
00:35:46,878 --> 00:35:49,341
- This is Marisa.
- Who?

371
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,842
Oh, hello.

372
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:52,384
I'm his fiancée.

373
00:35:52,467 --> 00:35:55,348
Very nice.
I'm his father's ex-lover.

374
00:35:55,386 --> 00:35:56,848
Pepa, listen--

375
00:35:56,889 --> 00:35:58,350
This is Candela.

376
00:35:58,389 --> 00:36:00,185
Pleased to meet you.

377
00:36:00,225 --> 00:36:01,310
Carlos, please.

378
00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:04,357
Pardon the mess.
My life's been hectic lately.

379
00:36:06,522 --> 00:36:08,443
Can you fix telephones?

380
00:36:08,524 --> 00:36:10,612
I... can try.

381
00:36:10,693 --> 00:36:12,823
Come with me.

382
00:36:14,365 --> 00:36:15,993
This one's out of order...

383
00:36:16,075 --> 00:36:18,997
and I'm expecting a call
from your dad.

384
00:36:19,078 --> 00:36:20,998
Candela, make some coffee.

385
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,332
We have to go.

386
00:36:22,373 --> 00:36:24,335
Yeah. Good idea.

387
00:36:24,375 --> 00:36:26,462
Don't be rude.
This is my house.

388
00:36:26,544 --> 00:36:28,631
We've got to talk.

389
00:36:28,712 --> 00:36:30,299
It can't be that urgent!

390
00:36:30,381 --> 00:36:32,301
- Have you any tools?
- Yes, in the kitchen.

391
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:34,221
I'll go get them.

392
00:36:35,553 --> 00:36:37,766
Is this any time for repairs?

393
00:36:39,057 --> 00:36:41,980
Don't you recognize her?

394
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:45,233
She was in the phone booth
last night.

395
00:36:46,481 --> 00:36:47,985
I hadn't noticed.

396
00:36:50,069 --> 00:36:52,490
If you don't want me here, say so.

397
00:36:52,571 --> 00:36:54,533
Who says I don't?

398
00:36:54,614 --> 00:36:57,872
I just learned
that my ex-lover has a son.

399
00:36:57,952 --> 00:36:59,705
And he's here.

400
00:36:59,787 --> 00:37:01,498
Shouldn't he come first?

401
00:37:01,581 --> 00:37:03,543
But I've got a big problem.

402
00:37:03,624 --> 00:37:05,838
Okay, we'll talk.

403
00:37:08,045 --> 00:37:10,592
Let me know when we're leaving.

404
00:37:10,673 --> 00:37:12,260
It won't take long.

405
00:37:12,341 --> 00:37:13,845
Here.

406
00:37:14,845 --> 00:37:16,932
Where's Ivan?

407
00:37:17,014 --> 00:37:18,433
I don't know.

408
00:37:18,514 --> 00:37:21,604
Why doesn't he call?
I need to talk to him.

409
00:37:21,684 --> 00:37:23,605
I don't see him very much.

410
00:37:23,686 --> 00:37:27,611
Don't lie.
He's taking a trip with your mom.

411
00:37:27,691 --> 00:37:32,367
My mother thinks
he's going with you.

412
00:37:32,446 --> 00:37:34,868
Then it's someone else.

413
00:37:34,949 --> 00:37:38,874
So that's why
he didn't sleep at his studio!

414
00:37:38,953 --> 00:37:43,838
- How do you know?
- I spent all night keeping watch.

415
00:37:43,917 --> 00:37:45,336
You must think I'm crazy.

416
00:37:45,418 --> 00:37:49,928
No. You're just nervous
from a lack of sleep.

417
00:37:50,006 --> 00:37:51,801
You didn't know about me?

418
00:37:51,883 --> 00:37:54,137
Never. I had no idea.

419
00:37:54,219 --> 00:37:56,306
Ivan never tells me anything.

420
00:37:56,387 --> 00:37:58,308
I just find things out.

421
00:37:58,389 --> 00:38:02,648
Last night,
when I saw your picture--

422
00:38:02,727 --> 00:38:05,149
"From your dad,
who doesn't deserve you. Ivan."

423
00:38:05,189 --> 00:38:07,193
That's how I knew.

424
00:38:08,108 --> 00:38:11,281
He never says anything,
never admits anything...

425
00:38:11,362 --> 00:38:13,616
never criticizes.

426
00:38:13,655 --> 00:38:17,120
Do you think I didn't know
he was cheating?

427
00:38:17,201 --> 00:38:20,123
Sure, but I put up with it.

428
00:38:20,204 --> 00:38:24,128
I tried talking to him civilly,
but it didn't work.

429
00:38:25,209 --> 00:38:29,133
So I begged him not to lie
about important things...

430
00:38:29,214 --> 00:38:32,805
and to tell me
if he stopped loving me.

431
00:38:33,843 --> 00:38:37,517
Last week, I finally got him
to admit he didn't love me.

432
00:38:38,473 --> 00:38:40,519
It was like pulling teeth.

433
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:45,068
Thanks for listening,
since your father wouldn't.

434
00:38:46,147 --> 00:38:48,903
Waiting for his call
had me ready to choke myself...

435
00:38:48,985 --> 00:38:51,114
with the telephone cord.

436
00:38:51,195 --> 00:38:54,660
- So I ripped out the phone.
- You did right.

437
00:38:54,739 --> 00:38:58,038
She's gonna jump!

438
00:38:58,077 --> 00:38:59,831
Your friend's jumping!

439
00:39:02,248 --> 00:39:04,210
She jumped!

440
00:39:05,167 --> 00:39:06,295
Help!

441
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:08,464
Carlos, be careful!

442
00:39:12,675 --> 00:39:15,598
Don't let go of me, Pepa!

443
00:39:15,678 --> 00:39:19,603
Oh, my God! I can't do it.

444
00:39:19,682 --> 00:39:21,686
Come on! Pull!

445
00:39:35,365 --> 00:39:37,453
You could have killed yourself!

446
00:39:37,534 --> 00:39:39,873
That was the idea!

447
00:39:41,622 --> 00:39:43,125
I'm desperate.

448
00:39:43,208 --> 00:39:46,924
So am l, and I don't go
jumping off terraces.

449
00:39:46,961 --> 00:39:50,802
Young people don't know
how to fight for things.

450
00:39:50,882 --> 00:39:53,804
You think life is all pleasure.

451
00:39:53,885 --> 00:39:55,471
Well, it isn't.

452
00:39:55,553 --> 00:39:58,434
You have to suffer a lot.

453
00:39:58,473 --> 00:40:02,481
Pepa, please.
This isn't the right time.

454
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,941
Yes. I'm sorry.

455
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,608
It's because you scared me.

456
00:40:06,689 --> 00:40:09,362
- Ivan--
- Yes?

457
00:40:09,443 --> 00:40:13,076
I mean Carlos. Bring me
my tranquilizers from the kitchen.

458
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,167
I'm in big trouble.

459
00:40:23,249 --> 00:40:25,336
I can see that.

460
00:40:25,417 --> 00:40:27,839
Carlos, do you love me?

461
00:40:27,921 --> 00:40:30,008
Please, not now.

462
00:40:33,634 --> 00:40:35,847
Okay, what's wrong?

463
00:40:35,929 --> 00:40:40,020
Three months ago,
I spent a weekend with a guy.

464
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:45,026
I didn't know his name or anything,
but after he left...

465
00:40:45,105 --> 00:40:47,693
I couldn't get him out of my mind.

466
00:40:47,775 --> 00:40:49,361
What happened that weekend?

467
00:40:49,442 --> 00:40:53,367
Nothing special.
We fucked the whole weekend.

468
00:40:53,446 --> 00:40:57,872
Just thinking about it
gives me goose bumps.

469
00:40:57,952 --> 00:41:01,041
It was like a revelation.

470
00:41:01,122 --> 00:41:04,420
Like making love
for the first time.

471
00:41:07,169 --> 00:41:08,589
I loved it.

472
00:41:08,671 --> 00:41:11,635
Sex means a lot at your age.

473
00:41:13,217 --> 00:41:15,806
Because his life
is always in danger...

474
00:41:15,888 --> 00:41:18,852
he's more intense
than other guys.

475
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:22,646
I knew he'd be back,
and I'd agree to anything.

476
00:41:22,685 --> 00:41:24,689
He came back?

477
00:41:24,729 --> 00:41:27,651
Two weeks ago...
with two more guys.

478
00:41:27,691 --> 00:41:31,490
- You let them all stay?
- They were with him.

479
00:41:32,487 --> 00:41:35,368
- They took advantage.
- Wait, wait.

480
00:41:35,407 --> 00:41:38,371
I noticed something weird about them...

481
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:41,374
and he confessed
that they were Shiite terrorists.

482
00:41:41,413 --> 00:41:43,877
I flipped. I really did.

483
00:41:43,917 --> 00:41:47,381
I knew it could be dangerous,
but I didn't think about it.

484
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:50,218
What's worse, they had weapons...

485
00:41:50,256 --> 00:41:52,344
and were planning
to attack somewhere.

486
00:41:52,425 --> 00:41:54,221
Then I said to him...

487
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:57,350
"You should have
told me about this."

488
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:59,517
That's when I realized it was a ploy.

489
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:02,521
He didn't love me. He used me.

490
00:42:04,395 --> 00:42:06,233
Gazpacho.

491
00:42:08,566 --> 00:42:10,487
You didn't call the cops?

492
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:11,948
Delicious.

493
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:16,120
How could l?
I was a hostage in my own house.

494
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,579
- They were arrested yesterday?
- Yes.

495
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:23,504
- The ones on TV?
- I threw out all their stuff...

496
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:25,503
but if they confess
where they were living--

497
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:27,965
If they're tortured,
they might tell.

498
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:30,760
They probably won't tell.

499
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:34,347
But if they do, the cops will
want me for collaborating...

500
00:42:34,427 --> 00:42:36,808
and you for not alerting them.

501
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:40,061
In my house,
I collaborate with whomever I want.

502
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:42,187
I didn't know where to go.

503
00:42:42,269 --> 00:42:45,024
I couldn't face my folks.

504
00:42:45,105 --> 00:42:47,609
It's bad enough
that I became a model.

505
00:42:47,691 --> 00:42:50,530
You need to see a lawyer.

506
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:54,034
I'll arrange for that.
You can't leave now.

507
00:42:54,115 --> 00:42:56,494
- Go to Paulina Morales.
- The feminist?

508
00:42:56,575 --> 00:42:58,620
A feminist?

509
00:42:58,702 --> 00:43:02,042
As a woman,
she'll take a personal interest.

510
00:43:02,123 --> 00:43:05,504
I'll go change.
Then give me her address.

511
00:43:11,049 --> 00:43:13,554
Why are men like that?

512
00:43:18,056 --> 00:43:19,977
I really don't understand.

513
00:43:20,058 --> 00:43:23,481
I couldn't stand to be
with a man right now.

514
00:43:23,562 --> 00:43:25,482
That's all I needed!

515
00:43:37,911 --> 00:43:39,330
Help me!

516
00:43:39,411 --> 00:43:42,167
- What happened?
- Nothing. She fell asleep.

517
00:43:42,248 --> 00:43:43,667
So suddenly?

518
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:47,715
The strangest things
can happen suddenly.

519
00:43:47,795 --> 00:43:50,175
You should know, Candela.

520
00:43:50,256 --> 00:43:52,177
It's true.

521
00:43:52,258 --> 00:43:53,677
But a minute ago--

522
00:43:53,761 --> 00:43:57,184
A minute ago
she wanted to go home...

523
00:43:57,263 --> 00:43:59,517
but since you ignored her...

524
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:01,771
she got depressed
and had some gazpacho.

525
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:05,149
That made her fall asleep?

526
00:44:05,189 --> 00:44:08,780
Yes. It was spiked with barbiturates.

527
00:44:11,862 --> 00:44:13,740
Sorry.

528
00:44:13,822 --> 00:44:15,659
We could call a doctor.

529
00:44:17,743 --> 00:44:20,833
- What kind of barbiturates?
- Morphidal.

530
00:44:20,872 --> 00:44:23,543
- How many?
- Twenty-five or thirty.

531
00:44:23,624 --> 00:44:26,380
She'll have a good sleep.

532
00:44:38,056 --> 00:44:42,022
Why did you do that?
Were you trying to kill yourself too?

533
00:44:43,061 --> 00:44:46,860
It was for your dad.
He loves gazpacho.

534
00:44:46,899 --> 00:44:49,362
It's no excuse...

535
00:44:49,401 --> 00:44:54,035
but after waiting for hours,
I just lost control.

536
00:44:54,073 --> 00:44:56,035
That's what happened to me.

537
00:44:56,075 --> 00:44:58,079
It could happen to anyone.

538
00:45:02,081 --> 00:45:04,377
Don't get me wrong.

539
00:45:04,417 --> 00:45:09,135
I didn't want to kill him--
just to make him stay.

540
00:45:09,213 --> 00:45:12,469
I meant to throw it, but--

541
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:14,470
I understand perfectly.

542
00:45:14,552 --> 00:45:17,308
Thanks. The lawyer's address?

543
00:45:17,389 --> 00:45:19,310
Thirty-one Castellana.

544
00:45:19,391 --> 00:45:21,312
Do you mind staying?

545
00:45:21,393 --> 00:45:23,815
The house is so full of women.

546
00:45:23,896 --> 00:45:27,485
- I'll stay as long as you like.
- Thanks. And fix the phone?

547
00:45:27,566 --> 00:45:30,990
- Are you okay?
- A bit shaken, but--

548
00:45:31,069 --> 00:45:33,324
Don't let her near the ledge.
See you later.

549
00:45:33,405 --> 00:45:35,242
Forget it.

550
00:45:47,086 --> 00:45:48,924
Hi, Ana.

551
00:45:53,928 --> 00:45:56,682
Look what fell down from the sky.

552
00:45:56,764 --> 00:45:59,518
It's mine. Thanks.

553
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:01,311
It seemed strange--Just one.

554
00:46:02,978 --> 00:46:04,481
Be more careful!

555
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:07,109
Ana was arguing with her boyfriend...

556
00:46:07,191 --> 00:46:09,905
and it almost hit her head.

557
00:46:18,870 --> 00:46:21,166
- You again!
- Hope you don't mind.

558
00:46:21,205 --> 00:46:22,833
Thirty-one Castellana.

559
00:46:23,917 --> 00:46:26,338
I'm glad to see you.

560
00:46:26,377 --> 00:46:28,840
My girlfriend loved the autograph.

561
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:33,055
When I tell her I saw you again,
she'll think we--

562
00:46:55,908 --> 00:46:57,536
Do you have eye drops?

563
00:46:57,617 --> 00:47:00,081
No. Sorry.

564
00:47:01,706 --> 00:47:03,626
We could buy some.

565
00:47:03,708 --> 00:47:05,044
That's okay.

566
00:47:05,126 --> 00:47:08,173
Why didn't I think of eyedrops?

567
00:47:08,212 --> 00:47:10,216
What a dope!

568
00:47:18,891 --> 00:47:20,853
It's working.

569
00:47:22,227 --> 00:47:24,148
Forget about them.

570
00:47:24,229 --> 00:47:28,654
But they're hijacking
the 10:00 P.M. Stockholm flight...

571
00:47:28,734 --> 00:47:31,824
and taking it to Beirut
to free some Shiite prisoners.

572
00:47:31,905 --> 00:47:36,163
That flight will be fully booked.
We must report it.

573
00:47:36,241 --> 00:47:38,162
Then the cops will get me too!

574
00:47:39,245 --> 00:47:42,335
I'll talk fast
so they can't trace the call.

575
00:47:42,415 --> 00:47:44,962
Yeah. You have a way with words.

576
00:47:52,592 --> 00:47:54,554
Police precinct. Hello.

577
00:47:55,930 --> 00:47:58,351
Tonight's 10:00 P.M. flight...

578
00:47:58,431 --> 00:48:00,518
to Stockholm...

579
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:03,189
will be hijacked by Shiite terrorists.

580
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:04,522
Thanks.

581
00:48:23,707 --> 00:48:25,628
Here we are.

582
00:48:25,709 --> 00:48:27,630
Don't tell anyone I cried.

583
00:48:27,711 --> 00:48:29,632
It'll be our secret.

584
00:48:29,713 --> 00:48:31,217
Good.

585
00:48:36,429 --> 00:48:39,727
- Here?
- Where it says "sign."

586
00:48:41,643 --> 00:48:43,647
Is Paulina Morales in?

587
00:48:43,728 --> 00:48:46,150
She's not seeing anyone this afternoon.

588
00:48:46,231 --> 00:48:49,487
It's urgent. It won't take long.

589
00:48:49,568 --> 00:48:52,073
Come on. You can arrange it.

590
00:48:53,239 --> 00:48:55,577
- Okay. Come on.
- Thanks.

591
00:48:56,242 --> 00:48:57,912
See you later.

592
00:49:02,915 --> 00:49:04,334
Wait here.

593
00:49:08,170 --> 00:49:09,631
I'm coming.

594
00:49:09,672 --> 00:49:11,134
Can I use the phone?

595
00:49:11,174 --> 00:49:12,677
Okay.

596
00:49:21,518 --> 00:49:24,149
Is Paulina there?

597
00:49:24,187 --> 00:49:25,858
Ivan?

598
00:49:28,191 --> 00:49:30,195
I'm going crazy.

599
00:49:42,539 --> 00:49:44,251
"Stockholm."

600
00:49:52,550 --> 00:49:54,554
You can go in.

601
00:50:03,603 --> 00:50:06,944
- Of all the nerve!
- She said I could come in.

602
00:50:07,024 --> 00:50:09,278
I'm in a hurry.

603
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:13,368
Don't worry.
This won't take long.

604
00:50:14,573 --> 00:50:16,535
May I sit down?

605
00:50:16,575 --> 00:50:18,537
Go ahead.

606
00:50:18,577 --> 00:50:20,539
What's the problem?

607
00:50:20,579 --> 00:50:23,710
A friend of mine is in trouble.

608
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:24,877
A "friend."

609
00:50:25,752 --> 00:50:29,092
She got involved
with a Shiite terrorist.

610
00:50:30,589 --> 00:50:33,262
I'm dying to smoke. May l?

611
00:50:36,930 --> 00:50:38,934
The shoe is hers.

612
00:50:39,975 --> 00:50:43,983
Anyway, he showed up
with two more Shiites.

613
00:50:44,063 --> 00:50:45,274
Three Shiites.

614
00:50:45,313 --> 00:50:48,236
All three just moved in.

615
00:50:48,275 --> 00:50:50,237
Now they've been arrested...

616
00:50:50,278 --> 00:50:52,908
and she's scared shitless.

617
00:50:53,613 --> 00:50:55,576
So she needs a lawyer.

618
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:57,744
Why come to me?

619
00:50:57,785 --> 00:51:00,498
- You're a feminist.
- So?

620
00:51:01,747 --> 00:51:03,794
This is clear-cut chauvinism.

621
00:51:03,875 --> 00:51:07,299
I'm going on a trip.
I'll recommend a colleague.

622
00:51:07,336 --> 00:51:09,632
There's not much to be done.

623
00:51:09,672 --> 00:51:12,762
She must turn herself in,
go to jail...

624
00:51:12,843 --> 00:51:16,266
and let the jury decide her case.

625
00:51:17,264 --> 00:51:21,022
- I don't understand.
- She's committed a crime.

626
00:51:21,101 --> 00:51:25,735
Her only crime was falling in love
and being afraid.

627
00:51:25,815 --> 00:51:27,777
I'd do the same.

628
00:51:27,817 --> 00:51:29,528
I'm sure.

629
00:51:30,694 --> 00:51:32,782
I don't believe this!

630
00:51:32,864 --> 00:51:36,329
And whom were you crying for?
Your friend?

631
00:51:37,451 --> 00:51:39,455
Not over her.

632
00:51:39,536 --> 00:51:41,332
You see?

633
00:51:41,372 --> 00:51:43,168
Aren't you the victim?

634
00:51:43,207 --> 00:51:45,712
Yes. I've also been cheated on.

635
00:51:45,793 --> 00:51:47,171
By a terrorist?

636
00:51:48,171 --> 00:51:50,091
You could say that.

637
00:51:50,173 --> 00:51:52,552
But not a Shiite. He's from Madrid.

638
00:51:52,634 --> 00:51:56,141
I don't give advice to the lovelorn.

639
00:51:56,220 --> 00:51:59,310
You're certainly no lawyer,
you bitch!

640
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:01,854
Leave, or I'll call the police!

641
00:52:09,692 --> 00:52:11,154
Was it helpful?

642
00:52:11,195 --> 00:52:13,157
Yes. I feel much better.

643
00:52:13,197 --> 00:52:14,658
Good.

644
00:52:19,370 --> 00:52:20,957
What's this doing here?

645
00:52:21,039 --> 00:52:24,295
A kid brought it
and said it's for Mr. Ivan.

646
00:52:24,375 --> 00:52:28,968
If he wants it, let him come upstairs
and show his face!

647
00:52:29,047 --> 00:52:31,803
Fine. Do you need some help?

648
00:52:31,883 --> 00:52:34,346
No, I don't!

649
00:52:36,471 --> 00:52:39,979
Pepa, I'm here in Madrid with you.
That's all I need.

650
00:52:40,058 --> 00:52:45,235
I'm also with you, and I'm so happy
to see you write this card. Pepa.

651
00:52:51,404 --> 00:52:53,074
He called?

652
00:52:56,909 --> 00:52:58,830
Yeah. I answered.

653
00:52:58,911 --> 00:53:00,330
Well? Give me that!

654
00:53:00,413 --> 00:53:04,755
- I shouldn't read your postcards.
- Never mind. What did he say?

655
00:53:04,835 --> 00:53:08,300
He's too embarrassed to see you,
because...

656
00:53:08,379 --> 00:53:10,300
you know who I am.

657
00:53:10,381 --> 00:53:11,926
How sensitive of him!

658
00:53:12,009 --> 00:53:13,929
I don't want to see him either...

659
00:53:14,011 --> 00:53:17,601
but if he wants his damn suitcase...

660
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:19,977
he'll have to come and get it!

661
00:53:20,058 --> 00:53:22,939
- How are the girls?
- Fine.

662
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:24,439
Where's Candela?

663
00:53:24,521 --> 00:53:26,275
In your room.

664
00:53:26,356 --> 00:53:27,776
Did anything happen?

665
00:53:27,859 --> 00:53:31,282
No, no. Did you see the lawyer?

666
00:53:31,361 --> 00:53:34,451
Yes. I'll tell you about it later.

667
00:53:41,538 --> 00:53:44,127
You mind my wearing your dress?

668
00:53:44,208 --> 00:53:47,298
Keep it. It looks nicer on you.

669
00:53:47,378 --> 00:53:50,802
Don't lose it again.
My shoes don't fit you.

670
00:53:50,883 --> 00:53:53,596
- You saw the lawyer?
- Yes.

671
00:53:54,636 --> 00:53:56,598
We're taking a trip.

672
00:53:57,722 --> 00:54:01,355
Running from the law
like two fugitives?

673
00:54:01,434 --> 00:54:05,692
It's best if we take a vacation
away from Madrid.

674
00:54:05,773 --> 00:54:07,692
I sure need one.

675
00:54:07,775 --> 00:54:10,279
I knew they'd lock me up...

676
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:12,281
and get you for hiding me.

677
00:54:12,321 --> 00:54:14,283
Nothing will happen.

678
00:54:14,323 --> 00:54:16,452
We'll come back in a week.

679
00:54:16,492 --> 00:54:19,623
You'll go to court
and tell everything...

680
00:54:19,662 --> 00:54:22,292
except for the fucking,
and that'll be that.

681
00:54:22,331 --> 00:54:26,464
Really? Don't lie to me.
You know I'm naive.

682
00:54:26,502 --> 00:54:29,132
The lawyer said not to worry....

683
00:54:29,172 --> 00:54:32,972
just to stay in touch with her.

684
00:54:33,009 --> 00:54:34,972
I'm causing so much trouble...

685
00:54:35,011 --> 00:54:38,142
as if you don't have
enough of your own.

686
00:54:38,181 --> 00:54:40,812
Let's water the plants now.

687
00:54:40,851 --> 00:54:42,981
Then we'll pack our bags.

688
00:54:46,983 --> 00:54:48,903
"Dr. J. Pardo.

689
00:54:48,985 --> 00:54:52,658
Test results on patient Pepa Marcos. "

690
00:54:52,696 --> 00:54:54,324
Christ!

691
00:54:59,704 --> 00:55:02,501
- What about the animals?
- I don't know.

692
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:06,423
Your stepson was
snooping around all day, spying.

693
00:55:06,502 --> 00:55:09,425
It's quite natural,
but he won't find much.

694
00:55:09,505 --> 00:55:11,593
Relax. Let me do that.

695
00:55:11,674 --> 00:55:12,927
Why?

696
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:15,431
- You feel okay?
- Sure.

697
00:55:15,511 --> 00:55:19,352
You two clean the cage
while I water.

698
00:55:23,604 --> 00:55:26,610
Poor things.
You're going to miss me.

699
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:28,611
You're depressed.

700
00:55:28,692 --> 00:55:31,448
Just like me.

701
00:55:31,528 --> 00:55:34,117
But you'll come along when I move.

702
00:55:34,198 --> 00:55:36,119
I won't leave you alone.

703
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:39,707
I'd be a fine one to abandon you.

704
00:55:41,622 --> 00:55:44,377
She's out cold. Let's see.

705
00:55:45,710 --> 00:55:49,886
Anyway, who cares?
Too bad for her.

706
00:55:52,383 --> 00:55:53,970
Poor bunnies!

707
00:55:54,053 --> 00:55:55,806
Look. Totally dry.

708
00:55:55,888 --> 00:55:58,142
Pepa just has too much on her mind.

709
00:55:58,223 --> 00:56:01,146
Did you ever have rabbits?

710
00:56:01,226 --> 00:56:04,232
Back home I had many.

711
00:56:04,313 --> 00:56:06,275
I know lots about them.

712
00:56:07,816 --> 00:56:11,281
Look how they love turnips.

713
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:15,788
Carlos, I'm sorry I teased you
about your stuttering.

714
00:56:15,825 --> 00:56:18,622
- Sometimes I'm so dumb.
- Forget it.

715
00:56:18,661 --> 00:56:20,748
But you went a little too far.

716
00:56:20,830 --> 00:56:23,418
You didn't behave properly.

717
00:56:23,499 --> 00:56:26,965
Men keep taking advantage of me.

718
00:56:27,003 --> 00:56:30,468
I always realize it when it's too late.

719
00:56:30,507 --> 00:56:35,810
Look how the Arab world treated me.

720
00:56:35,845 --> 00:56:38,392
I sure didn't deserve that.

721
00:56:46,648 --> 00:56:49,487
This is Lucia.
I need to see you.

722
00:56:49,567 --> 00:56:52,156
I can't. I'm leaving town.

723
00:56:52,238 --> 00:56:53,908
We have to talk.

724
00:56:53,990 --> 00:56:56,829
About something
that concerns us both.

725
00:56:56,867 --> 00:57:00,207
If you mean Ivan,
I'm not interested.

726
00:57:00,288 --> 00:57:02,793
Then why are you
going away with him?

727
00:57:02,833 --> 00:57:04,544
Lady, you're nuts!

728
00:57:04,625 --> 00:57:08,133
Between Ivan and me,
there's nothing but pain.

729
00:57:08,171 --> 00:57:11,636
I'm coming anyway.
I know where you live.

730
00:57:11,716 --> 00:57:15,307
For two days everyone
has been saying "no" to me.

731
00:57:15,345 --> 00:57:17,725
Now it's my turn to say "no."

732
00:57:17,806 --> 00:57:22,315
I must see Ivan
before he leaves.

733
00:57:22,394 --> 00:57:25,734
Look somewhere else
and leave me alone!

734
00:57:25,815 --> 00:57:27,151
- That was Mom?
- Yes.

735
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:28,986
Don't be too hard on her.

736
00:57:29,027 --> 00:57:30,947
The way she talks--

737
00:57:31,029 --> 00:57:33,408
She's mentally ill.

738
00:57:33,488 --> 00:57:35,701
She threatened to come here.

739
00:57:35,741 --> 00:57:38,330
- She shouldn't see you.
- And me?

740
00:57:38,369 --> 00:57:42,252
Fix Marisa some coffee.
We need to talk.

741
00:57:42,332 --> 00:57:45,421
The lawyer didn't work out.
We got into a fight.

742
00:57:45,501 --> 00:57:47,172
She won't defend her?

743
00:57:47,211 --> 00:57:50,134
She'd rather prosecute her.
How'd you meet her?

744
00:57:50,214 --> 00:57:51,550
She was Mom's lawyer.

745
00:57:51,633 --> 00:57:54,388
I'm not surprised
your mother is sick.

746
00:57:55,470 --> 00:57:58,267
They split up before I was born.

747
00:57:58,348 --> 00:58:00,310
After my birth, she went crazy...

748
00:58:00,391 --> 00:58:02,228
and was placed
in a mental institution.

749
00:58:02,269 --> 00:58:04,065
My grandparents raised me.

750
00:58:05,064 --> 00:58:08,362
They wouldn't let Ivan see me.

751
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,029
You can look now.

752
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:15,786
Mom was released a year ago.

753
00:58:15,867 --> 00:58:20,084
When she got out,
she wanted to go back to Ivan...

754
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:22,542
but he was with you.

755
00:58:22,581 --> 00:58:24,627
Can you zip me up?

756
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:28,758
So she sued him for millions...

757
00:58:28,797 --> 00:58:32,262
for all the time
she'd been locked up.

758
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:34,054
Paulina was her lawyer.

759
00:58:34,094 --> 00:58:36,056
Your mother doesn't mess around.

760
00:58:36,096 --> 00:58:39,937
Paulina tried to sue Ivan,
but it didn't work.

761
00:58:40,017 --> 00:58:41,938
What an insane story.

762
00:58:41,978 --> 00:58:43,815
Mom hates me.

763
00:58:43,896 --> 00:58:47,569
I represent all her years
without Ivan.

764
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:49,528
Well, I love you.

765
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:52,866
You're the only good thing
Ivan ever did.

766
00:58:55,825 --> 00:58:59,623
- Oh, it's you.
- I didn't want to interrupt.

767
00:58:59,704 --> 00:59:02,961
- Why so dressed up?
- I'm going out.

768
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,877
Don't mention the lawyer.

769
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:07,924
- What?
- See if you can wake up Marisa.

770
00:59:07,963 --> 00:59:10,718
- And if not?
- It's up to you.

771
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:13,637
- Anyway, we're leaving.
- What?

772
00:59:13,718 --> 00:59:15,054
- On a trip.
- Where?

773
00:59:15,137 --> 00:59:17,057
- It's a secret.
- We're fugitives.

774
00:59:17,139 --> 00:59:19,769
It's better if you don't know.

775
00:59:19,850 --> 00:59:22,646
- But he knows everything.
- Come on.

776
00:59:29,902 --> 00:59:31,447
What if Ivan calls?

777
00:59:32,696 --> 00:59:35,577
Tell him I expect nothing
from him.

778
00:59:35,657 --> 00:59:38,455
All I have left from him
is the suitcase...

779
00:59:38,493 --> 00:59:40,414
and I'm getting rid of it now.

780
00:59:41,663 --> 00:59:45,338
No. Don't say anything.

781
00:59:45,418 --> 00:59:47,172
Don't get the phone...

782
00:59:47,253 --> 00:59:48,297
or the door.

783
00:59:48,379 --> 00:59:49,632
Fine.

784
00:59:50,841 --> 00:59:52,594
I'll be right back.

785
00:59:59,016 --> 01:00:03,274
I overheard about your mom,
and I'm really sorry.

786
01:00:05,356 --> 01:00:07,234
You're a kissing fanatic!

787
01:00:07,316 --> 01:00:10,155
Let's give her some coffee.

788
01:00:22,373 --> 01:00:24,043
What's wrong?

789
01:00:24,125 --> 01:00:26,505
Nothing. She's having fun.

790
01:00:28,505 --> 01:00:30,550
I've never seen her like this.

791
01:00:30,632 --> 01:00:33,638
Don't wake her.
She's having a great time.

792
01:00:33,718 --> 01:00:35,514
See her face?

793
01:00:35,553 --> 01:00:37,683
She's having a ball.

794
01:00:39,016 --> 01:00:40,269
Her face!

795
01:00:42,519 --> 01:00:44,106
Look at her lip!

796
01:00:53,197 --> 01:00:56,704
Hi. I've come for my bag.
Pepa said it was here.

797
01:00:56,742 --> 01:01:01,837
That's strange.
A kid brought it down earlier...

798
01:01:01,915 --> 01:01:04,879
but when Pepa saw it,
she threw a fit.

799
01:01:04,918 --> 01:01:09,552
- So where's the bag?
- She took it and she said...

800
01:01:09,630 --> 01:01:12,261
"If he wants it,
let him come and get it...

801
01:01:12,342 --> 01:01:13,929
and show his face!"

802
01:01:14,011 --> 01:01:16,098
That's what she said.

803
01:01:16,179 --> 01:01:17,682
She's upstairs now.

804
01:01:17,764 --> 01:01:19,977
I'm in a hurry.

805
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:23,857
She's probably calmed down...

806
01:01:23,937 --> 01:01:25,774
but you never know.

807
01:01:25,815 --> 01:01:28,486
I'll be back tomorrow.
Don't tell her I was here.

808
01:01:28,567 --> 01:01:33,243
Sir, I'm a Jehovah's Witness
and cannot tell lies.

809
01:01:33,281 --> 01:01:36,913
Only the truth,
and nothing but the truth.

810
01:01:36,993 --> 01:01:38,370
But if she doesn't ask--

811
01:01:38,453 --> 01:01:41,334
If she asks,
I have to tell the gospel truth.

812
01:01:41,414 --> 01:01:43,043
Good-bye.

813
01:01:43,124 --> 01:01:44,501
I'd like to lie!

814
01:01:44,584 --> 01:01:47,758
The bad thing
about my religion is...

815
01:01:47,838 --> 01:01:49,926
that we can't.

816
01:01:56,805 --> 01:02:02,066
I love the sound of the trumpets
on Judgment Day

817
01:02:04,104 --> 01:02:08,112
Ivan, I have to speak
to you immediately.

818
01:02:08,192 --> 01:02:11,698
Leave a message
and tell me when and where.

819
01:02:13,656 --> 01:02:15,493
I can't pick up my bag.

820
01:02:15,574 --> 01:02:17,996
I wanted to talk to you...

821
01:02:18,036 --> 01:02:21,292
but I see you're avoiding me.

822
01:02:21,330 --> 01:02:24,544
I'll try again in a few days...

823
01:02:24,625 --> 01:02:27,005
when you're a bit calmer.

824
01:02:27,045 --> 01:02:30,468
I want you to know
that our years together...

825
01:02:30,507 --> 01:02:33,973
were the best of my life.

826
01:02:35,345 --> 01:02:37,976
I'm not going away
with any woman.

827
01:02:40,183 --> 01:02:42,521
Good-bye, sweetheart.

828
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:45,776
I wish you the best
with all my heart.

829
01:02:45,856 --> 01:02:50,992
I'm so unhappy

830
01:02:51,028 --> 01:02:54,451
Because you no longer love me

831
01:02:54,532 --> 01:02:58,373
Why should I try
to change your mind

832
01:03:00,371 --> 01:03:05,172
Be happy, my love

833
01:03:05,209 --> 01:03:12,682
For I'll never forget
the love you gave me

834
01:03:14,386 --> 01:03:17,935
I'm so unhappy

835
01:03:20,726 --> 01:03:23,648
Look at him!

836
01:03:23,729 --> 01:03:25,316
He's nuts!

837
01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:40,372
I'll show her, all right!

838
01:03:40,413 --> 01:03:43,920
Pepa, you'll pay dearly
for those three Shiites!

839
01:03:45,585 --> 01:03:48,215
I'm not going away
with any women.

840
01:03:48,254 --> 01:03:50,675
Good-bye, sweetheart.
I wish you the best--

841
01:03:50,758 --> 01:03:52,594
Liar!

842
01:03:52,634 --> 01:03:54,179
Maybe it's true.

843
01:03:54,260 --> 01:03:56,640
He can fool me with everything
but his voice.

844
01:03:56,721 --> 01:04:01,314
I know all his intonations.
I worked long enough with him.

845
01:04:01,393 --> 01:04:03,272
Goddamn phone!

846
01:04:04,146 --> 01:04:05,983
What were you doing?

847
01:04:07,483 --> 01:04:09,780
That damn fucking bitch!

848
01:04:09,819 --> 01:04:12,115
What did you see in her?

849
01:04:12,154 --> 01:04:14,408
Let's get your luggage.

850
01:04:14,448 --> 01:04:16,118
- You did it again.
- Forget it.

851
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:19,958
Calm down!
Just look at this place.

852
01:04:21,538 --> 01:04:24,711
- The cops!
- Take it easy. Come on.

853
01:04:24,793 --> 01:04:27,172
It's Ivan.
I knew he's no coward.

854
01:04:27,253 --> 01:04:29,341
It's your mother.

855
01:04:29,422 --> 01:04:30,675
- Let's play.
- I can't!

856
01:04:30,757 --> 01:04:32,761
- Should I let her in?
- Yes.

857
01:04:32,842 --> 01:04:35,807
- Read the instructions!
- "Strategy is--"

858
01:04:35,846 --> 01:04:37,557
Not out loud!

859
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:43,857
What are you doing here,
traitor?

860
01:04:43,938 --> 01:04:46,819
- Well--
- Carlos, who is it?

861
01:04:46,857 --> 01:04:48,360
I don't know.

862
01:04:48,442 --> 01:04:49,821
It's the police.

863
01:04:51,611 --> 01:04:53,073
What do they want?

864
01:04:54,407 --> 01:04:58,081
We understood.

865
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:00,373
- Come on.
- Right.

866
01:05:01,330 --> 01:05:03,794
Shut up or I'll smack you.

867
01:05:10,007 --> 01:05:11,467
Good evening.

868
01:05:11,507 --> 01:05:14,138
Is she with you?

869
01:05:14,177 --> 01:05:16,223
We met in the elevator.

870
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:25,984
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

871
01:05:26,024 --> 01:05:29,781
-Just discussing the lady's dress.
- It's awful.

872
01:05:29,861 --> 01:05:32,490
- It's just a dress.
- But it's awful.

873
01:05:32,529 --> 01:05:34,033
Maybe she likes it.

874
01:05:34,073 --> 01:05:38,665
Stop acting like a kid
in front of the policemen!

875
01:05:41,914 --> 01:05:44,879
"I love you, need you, want you."

876
01:05:46,085 --> 01:05:48,173
"Your Ivan."

877
01:05:48,212 --> 01:05:50,634
May I ask why you're here?

878
01:05:50,715 --> 01:05:53,220
A call was made
from your telephone...

879
01:05:53,301 --> 01:05:54,888
about some terrorists.

880
01:05:54,970 --> 01:05:56,891
Pardon?

881
01:05:56,972 --> 01:06:01,564
Someone called from here
about the Shiite terrorists.

882
01:06:01,643 --> 01:06:03,688
See! I told you!

883
01:06:03,771 --> 01:06:05,900
Those kids!

884
01:06:05,981 --> 01:06:11,033
There's been some mistake. My phone's
been out of order all day.

885
01:06:11,111 --> 01:06:13,157
She just now pulled it out.

886
01:06:13,238 --> 01:06:15,618
I called her 20 minutes ago.

887
01:06:15,699 --> 01:06:17,745
Ignore her. She's a bit crazy.

888
01:06:17,827 --> 01:06:20,917
- What am I charged with?
- Nothing.

889
01:06:20,997 --> 01:06:24,545
We just wanted information
about who called.

890
01:06:24,625 --> 01:06:26,003
Who ripped out the phone?

891
01:06:26,086 --> 01:06:28,298
I did. This morning.

892
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:30,509
So nobody's called
from here today.

893
01:06:30,590 --> 01:06:32,678
Pepa's some talker!

894
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:33,929
Why?

895
01:06:34,010 --> 01:06:37,768
I was expecting a call.
They didn't call, and I got upset.

896
01:06:37,807 --> 01:06:40,395
Who? Ivan? Where is he?

897
01:06:40,433 --> 01:06:43,774
Shut up. I'll ask the questions.
Well... we will.

898
01:06:43,813 --> 01:06:46,651
Go ahead. Ask her who Ivan is.

899
01:06:46,731 --> 01:06:49,612
- Who's Ivan?
- The cause of this mess...

900
01:06:49,693 --> 01:06:52,240
and of the mess
your partner's about to see.

901
01:06:53,948 --> 01:06:55,785
He's going to find Marisa.

902
01:06:55,866 --> 01:06:57,077
All right. Explain.

903
01:06:57,118 --> 01:06:59,247
May I sit down?

904
01:07:00,789 --> 01:07:04,212
If I'm to bare my soul,
I'd rather be comfortable.

905
01:07:04,292 --> 01:07:06,254
I've had a hard day.

906
01:07:06,294 --> 01:07:07,797
Are you comfortable?

907
01:07:07,838 --> 01:07:10,467
I'd be more comfortable
alone with my friends...

908
01:07:10,548 --> 01:07:12,093
playing Strategy.

909
01:07:12,134 --> 01:07:14,764
You can't always
have everything.

910
01:07:14,845 --> 01:07:16,681
We agree on that.

911
01:07:16,763 --> 01:07:19,393
Who is this Ivan?

912
01:07:19,474 --> 01:07:23,608
He was my lover.
Before that he was with her.

913
01:07:23,687 --> 01:07:26,192
He's my son's father.

914
01:07:26,273 --> 01:07:28,652
Him?
What's he doing here?

915
01:07:28,734 --> 01:07:30,905
He came to rent my apartment.

916
01:07:30,987 --> 01:07:32,114
I didn't know.

917
01:07:32,155 --> 01:07:35,453
I get the feeling
you're pulling my leg.

918
01:07:35,490 --> 01:07:38,956
You think I like
baring my soul to strangers?

919
01:07:38,995 --> 01:07:42,126
Well, you're wrong.
It's humiliating.

920
01:07:42,206 --> 01:07:43,960
Damn it, Mom!

921
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,546
- Candela, get me a drink.
- What kind?

922
01:07:46,628 --> 01:07:49,300
- There's gazpacho.
- Right! Gazpacho!

923
01:07:49,339 --> 01:07:50,842
Let's go.

924
01:07:52,634 --> 01:07:55,473
- Where are you going?
- For gazpacho. Want some?

925
01:07:55,511 --> 01:07:58,434
We're on duty,
but we don't want to be rude--

926
01:07:58,514 --> 01:08:00,853
Gazpacho for everyone.

927
01:08:00,893 --> 01:08:03,105
Is she sleeping?

928
01:08:03,187 --> 01:08:05,984
Like a log.
She's Carlos' fiancée.

929
01:08:06,023 --> 01:08:09,363
She was tired.
You want me to wake her up?

930
01:08:09,443 --> 01:08:11,155
Not yet.

931
01:08:11,236 --> 01:08:15,161
Why don't you sit down?
I'm getting a stiff neck.

932
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:25,796
We have nothing against you--

933
01:08:25,877 --> 01:08:27,338
Thanks a lot.

934
01:08:27,420 --> 01:08:30,343
Without being inquisitive...

935
01:08:30,382 --> 01:08:32,971
you must admit
this is a little weird.

936
01:08:33,051 --> 01:08:35,055
A charred bedroom...

937
01:08:35,136 --> 01:08:36,848
a broken phone,
a smashed window--

938
01:08:36,889 --> 01:08:39,477
It's been weird, all right.

939
01:08:39,557 --> 01:08:42,021
Okay. Start at the beginning.

940
01:08:42,061 --> 01:08:44,399
And make it clear,
concise, and fair.

941
01:08:44,479 --> 01:08:45,690
I don't know if I can.

942
01:08:45,730 --> 01:08:48,862
I'm too hurt to be clear,
concise, and fair.

943
01:08:48,901 --> 01:08:49,861
Words!

944
01:08:49,902 --> 01:08:53,117
-Just the facts.
- Okay.

945
01:08:53,197 --> 01:08:55,660
I lived here... with Ivan.

946
01:08:55,741 --> 01:08:59,374
We loved each other.
At least, I loved him.

947
01:08:59,412 --> 01:09:03,336
After months of trying
to keep our love together...

948
01:09:04,417 --> 01:09:06,546
we split up a week ago.

949
01:09:06,585 --> 01:09:11,178
He told me to pack his bags.
He'd be taking a trip...

950
01:09:11,258 --> 01:09:12,928
with another woman.

951
01:09:13,010 --> 01:09:15,849
- He said that?
- He never travels alone.

952
01:09:15,929 --> 01:09:19,770
Remember, these two
for the cops. An extra dose.

953
01:09:19,809 --> 01:09:21,645
Careful.

954
01:09:21,727 --> 01:09:23,647
This is too warm.

955
01:09:26,858 --> 01:09:28,402
Carlos, my God!

956
01:09:28,442 --> 01:09:32,325
In front of your mother,
the cops, your fiancée!

957
01:09:32,404 --> 01:09:33,740
Aren't you afraid?

958
01:09:33,781 --> 01:09:35,952
Go on, please.

959
01:09:36,034 --> 01:09:38,873
So I packed up his stuff
and went to work.

960
01:09:38,953 --> 01:09:41,792
When I came back,
the house was like this.

961
01:09:41,873 --> 01:09:44,586
Except for the phone,
which I did.

962
01:09:44,667 --> 01:09:47,298
The suitcase was gone...

963
01:09:47,378 --> 01:09:50,134
and the bed was all burned.

964
01:09:50,214 --> 01:09:54,932
They're taking very long.
Go. Check.

965
01:09:56,471 --> 01:09:59,310
They're probably kissing.

966
01:09:59,350 --> 01:10:01,813
- What about Marisa?
- She'd better wake up.

967
01:10:01,894 --> 01:10:04,315
Takes after his father.

968
01:10:05,314 --> 01:10:07,819
- Now, who's that?
- Yeah?

969
01:10:07,858 --> 01:10:09,946
- Telephone repair. And you?
- Police.

970
01:10:10,027 --> 01:10:12,783
- Your I.D.?
- And yours?

971
01:10:21,081 --> 01:10:22,960
Are you the lady
who called this morning?

972
01:10:22,999 --> 01:10:26,966
Yes. Here's the phone,
and here's the plug.

973
01:10:27,045 --> 01:10:30,259
I reached her here by phone
20 minutes ago.

974
01:10:30,340 --> 01:10:32,010
There she goes again!

975
01:10:32,092 --> 01:10:34,054
Not on this phone.

976
01:10:34,135 --> 01:10:35,931
Let's get to the point.

977
01:10:36,013 --> 01:10:39,938
Do you know
any Shiite terrorists?

978
01:10:40,017 --> 01:10:42,563
Shut up! He's asking her!

979
01:10:42,644 --> 01:10:45,024
I didn't know Madrid had any.

980
01:10:46,357 --> 01:10:47,902
Do you know them?

981
01:10:47,984 --> 01:10:51,282
Not me. I'm not into politics.

982
01:10:51,362 --> 01:10:53,449
Sure, man.
They were on TV today!

983
01:10:53,531 --> 01:10:56,620
- Shut up!
- You want the TV on?

984
01:10:56,701 --> 01:10:59,581
I'm not interested in Shiites.

985
01:10:59,662 --> 01:11:01,165
Ma'am, what about you?

986
01:11:01,247 --> 01:11:04,838
Pepa and I have
important things to discuss.

987
01:11:04,876 --> 01:11:06,045
Men, right?

988
01:11:06,128 --> 01:11:07,463
What's more important?

989
01:11:07,545 --> 01:11:09,842
Fine. We'll talk about men.

990
01:11:12,675 --> 01:11:15,681
Is Ivan involved
with these terrorists?

991
01:11:17,097 --> 01:11:21,022
- Relax.
- Ivan?

992
01:11:21,059 --> 01:11:23,647
I don't know.
He's hidden so many things from me.

993
01:11:23,729 --> 01:11:25,566
Can you give me his address...

994
01:11:26,941 --> 01:11:28,277
or phone number?

995
01:11:28,358 --> 01:11:32,283
He has no phone.
And he's not home.

996
01:11:32,363 --> 01:11:34,534
I told you he's leaving town.

997
01:11:34,615 --> 01:11:36,201
Try the airport.

998
01:11:37,118 --> 01:11:40,124
The airport? Where's he going?

999
01:12:04,563 --> 01:12:06,192
Where is he going?

1000
01:12:06,273 --> 01:12:10,198
To Stockholm... tonight.
With Paulina Morales.

1001
01:12:10,277 --> 01:12:12,323
Stockholm!

1002
01:12:12,404 --> 01:12:14,826
Why didn't you say so before?

1003
01:12:14,908 --> 01:12:17,579
Because I just figured it out.

1004
01:12:18,577 --> 01:12:21,625
Now I understand it all--

1005
01:12:21,705 --> 01:12:23,334
The phone call.

1006
01:12:23,416 --> 01:12:27,216
What an idiot I am!
Why didn't I see it before?

1007
01:12:28,630 --> 01:12:31,010
Your lawyer
played it beautifully.

1008
01:12:31,091 --> 01:12:34,890
You didn't know
they'd be hijacking that flight?

1009
01:12:37,138 --> 01:12:38,767
The Shiites?

1010
01:12:42,144 --> 01:12:46,111
The whole country knows.
It was on TV.

1011
01:12:46,148 --> 01:12:48,736
But the tip
came from this phone.

1012
01:12:48,818 --> 01:12:51,614
I want to know
who the hell called...

1013
01:12:51,654 --> 01:12:54,118
or I'll haul you all in!

1014
01:12:55,366 --> 01:12:58,163
Why aren't you at the airport?

1015
01:12:58,244 --> 01:13:01,709
There are more cops there
than passengers.

1016
01:13:02,791 --> 01:13:05,379
I don't know what's going on...

1017
01:13:05,459 --> 01:13:07,588
but if you don't start talking--

1018
01:13:07,670 --> 01:13:10,467
Chief, this stuff has been spiked.

1019
01:13:13,051 --> 01:13:15,097
What's in the gazpacho?

1020
01:13:15,178 --> 01:13:18,018
Tomatoes, cucumbers...

1021
01:13:18,098 --> 01:13:21,021
bell pepper, onion...

1022
01:13:21,101 --> 01:13:22,645
one garlic clove...

1023
01:13:24,646 --> 01:13:28,029
oil, salt, vinegar...

1024
01:13:28,067 --> 01:13:30,530
some day-old bread, and water.

1025
01:13:30,611 --> 01:13:33,241
The secret's in mixing it right.

1026
01:13:33,323 --> 01:13:36,078
Ivan loves the way I mix it.

1027
01:13:36,159 --> 01:13:37,494
I made it for him.

1028
01:13:39,203 --> 01:13:40,999
You collect weapons?

1029
01:13:41,039 --> 01:13:42,041
Get back!

1030
01:13:42,833 --> 01:13:46,632
Move back. I don't want
to hurt the kids.

1031
01:13:46,711 --> 01:13:49,425
Is Ivan really going
to Stockholm?

1032
01:13:49,505 --> 01:13:52,345
It's just a hunch,
but I'm pretty sure.

1033
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:54,679
What did you have to tell him?

1034
01:13:54,719 --> 01:13:56,891
Nothing, now.

1035
01:13:56,972 --> 01:13:59,936
I just want to forget him.

1036
01:14:00,017 --> 01:14:02,856
And you should do the same.

1037
01:14:02,895 --> 01:14:05,733
In the hospital,
I had forgotten him.

1038
01:14:05,774 --> 01:14:08,403
I didn't remember anything.

1039
01:14:08,484 --> 01:14:10,112
Until suddenly...

1040
01:14:10,194 --> 01:14:14,410
one night,
I heard his voice on TV.

1041
01:14:14,490 --> 01:14:16,452
I didn't recognize his face...

1042
01:14:16,533 --> 01:14:18,663
just his voice.

1043
01:14:18,744 --> 01:14:20,958
He was telling a woman
he loved her.

1044
01:14:21,039 --> 01:14:24,964
I felt a spasm inside me.

1045
01:14:25,043 --> 01:14:28,591
I remembered all the times
he's said that to me.

1046
01:14:30,548 --> 01:14:33,012
I regained my sanity
and my memory.

1047
01:14:33,093 --> 01:14:34,553
From that moment on...

1048
01:14:34,636 --> 01:14:37,977
I acted as if I had been cured...

1049
01:14:38,057 --> 01:14:40,186
and they released me.

1050
01:14:40,266 --> 01:14:43,064
If you're cured,
stop aiming at me.

1051
01:14:43,104 --> 01:14:47,195
But I'm not cured.

1052
01:14:47,274 --> 01:14:50,489
I faked it, and I fooled them.

1053
01:14:50,569 --> 01:14:54,244
I can only forget him
by killing him.

1054
01:14:54,282 --> 01:14:57,371
How will you do that?

1055
01:14:57,451 --> 01:14:58,997
At the airport.

1056
01:14:59,078 --> 01:15:03,169
The airport is full of cops.
You heard him.

1057
01:15:03,249 --> 01:15:04,836
I'll manage.

1058
01:15:05,584 --> 01:15:07,338
Now that you know--

1059
01:15:08,462 --> 01:15:10,383
Let's drink a toast.

1060
01:15:22,019 --> 01:15:23,856
Drink!

1061
01:15:24,646 --> 01:15:25,690
You too.

1062
01:15:37,493 --> 01:15:39,497
Oh, my eyes!

1063
01:15:48,463 --> 01:15:49,673
My eyes!

1064
01:15:53,676 --> 01:15:55,890
She left the door open!

1065
01:15:55,971 --> 01:15:57,975
The door!

1066
01:16:10,235 --> 01:16:12,698
Take me to the airport,
please.

1067
01:16:12,781 --> 01:16:14,325
Sorry. I have a date.

1068
01:16:14,406 --> 01:16:16,035
Take me!

1069
01:16:16,117 --> 01:16:18,873
- What the hell is that?
- A gun. Let's go.

1070
01:16:18,954 --> 01:16:20,665
My girlfriend will be mad.

1071
01:16:20,746 --> 01:16:25,214
Not as mad as I'll be.
Quick, to Stockholm!

1072
01:16:34,719 --> 01:16:37,183
Right under my nose!

1073
01:16:37,263 --> 01:16:38,641
Did you see that?

1074
01:16:38,723 --> 01:16:40,602
Come on. After them!

1075
01:16:42,186 --> 01:16:43,898
You again! Great!

1076
01:16:43,980 --> 01:16:46,526
We're meant for each other!

1077
01:16:46,606 --> 01:16:48,443
Whom do we follow today?

1078
01:16:48,526 --> 01:16:50,864
- That motorcycle!
- That Harley!

1079
01:16:53,406 --> 01:16:55,285
I'll do my best.

1080
01:16:55,366 --> 01:16:56,869
To the airport!

1081
01:16:56,952 --> 01:16:59,123
Blow on my eyes.

1082
01:16:59,203 --> 01:17:02,877
That lady is crazy,
and she carries two guns.

1083
01:17:02,916 --> 01:17:06,423
- Why did she take Ambite?
- Because she's in a hurry.

1084
01:17:06,502 --> 01:17:09,508
Ah! Eye drops!

1085
01:17:09,588 --> 01:17:11,551
Anything else, ladies?

1086
01:17:11,591 --> 01:17:15,725
No. Just step on it.
That lady is dangerous.

1087
01:17:15,763 --> 01:17:18,811
No lady's dangerous
if you know how to handle her.

1088
01:17:18,891 --> 01:17:21,313
- There they are.
- I've got them.

1089
01:17:21,393 --> 01:17:22,312
I can't see.

1090
01:17:22,394 --> 01:17:25,692
He can never say "no."

1091
01:17:25,773 --> 01:17:28,737
Ana, that lady has two guns,
and she's a nut.

1092
01:17:28,776 --> 01:17:31,281
Look what she did to me!

1093
01:17:31,362 --> 01:17:34,535
You think I go around
like this for fun?

1094
01:17:34,614 --> 01:17:37,329
She's capable of anything!

1095
01:17:38,119 --> 01:17:41,417
My ass is the only one
allowed on that bike.

1096
01:17:41,456 --> 01:17:43,794
I'm fed up.

1097
01:17:43,834 --> 01:17:46,380
I'm gonna get myself
some quick cash...

1098
01:17:46,461 --> 01:17:47,964
buy myself his bike and split.

1099
01:17:48,047 --> 01:17:49,382
With a bike...

1100
01:17:49,464 --> 01:17:51,426
who needs a man?

1101
01:17:51,507 --> 01:17:54,472
Learning mechanics
is easier than learning male psychology.

1102
01:17:55,511 --> 01:17:58,059
You can figure out a bike...

1103
01:17:58,140 --> 01:18:01,104
but you can never
figure out a man.

1104
01:18:02,144 --> 01:18:04,398
She's going for his balls!

1105
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:07,110
I think she's just
trying to hang on.

1106
01:18:07,191 --> 01:18:09,654
Fresh out of the mental ward...

1107
01:18:09,735 --> 01:18:11,572
and she looks
like a professional biker.

1108
01:18:25,709 --> 01:18:28,674
Be careful! She's crazy!

1109
01:18:28,713 --> 01:18:30,092
And she has a gun!

1110
01:18:31,299 --> 01:18:32,761
Bitch!

1111
01:18:32,843 --> 01:18:34,471
Get down!

1112
01:18:42,519 --> 01:18:45,608
Shut up, idiot women!

1113
01:18:52,947 --> 01:18:54,867
Leave my man alone!

1114
01:19:15,053 --> 01:19:17,558
Can't you go any faster?

1115
01:19:17,597 --> 01:19:20,228
Lady, this thing is a relic.

1116
01:19:20,309 --> 01:19:23,315
A relic?
Just remember this gun!

1117
01:19:23,395 --> 01:19:24,857
Okay! Don't shoot!

1118
01:19:33,739 --> 01:19:35,743
Don't you sell guns?

1119
01:19:35,783 --> 01:19:37,494
I don't need them.

1120
01:19:37,577 --> 01:19:39,414
What if you're held up?

1121
01:19:39,454 --> 01:19:41,374
I avoid danger, just like now.

1122
01:19:41,414 --> 01:19:45,213
Sorry, ladies.
The chase is over.

1123
01:19:45,251 --> 01:19:49,509
Please, just take us
to the airport somehow.

1124
01:19:49,589 --> 01:19:52,345
I'm a taxi driver,
not a bounty hunter.

1125
01:19:52,425 --> 01:19:55,139
I warned you
she was a dangerous woman.

1126
01:19:55,220 --> 01:19:57,016
He said he could deal.

1127
01:20:17,743 --> 01:20:19,121
Right here.

1128
01:20:22,748 --> 01:20:24,085
Thanks.

1129
01:20:30,006 --> 01:20:32,052
Stockholm, please?

1130
01:20:32,133 --> 01:20:34,596
International flights
are over there.

1131
01:21:21,685 --> 01:21:24,190
- You're weak, Ivan.
- Yes, sweetheart.

1132
01:21:24,271 --> 01:21:27,903
- Don't agree with me!
- But you're right.

1133
01:21:27,984 --> 01:21:31,157
Sometimes I like to be wrong.

1134
01:22:26,670 --> 01:22:30,887
Take me back to the hospital.
That's my home.

1135
01:22:53,364 --> 01:22:55,326
Are you all right?

1136
01:22:55,408 --> 01:22:57,453
Let go.

1137
01:22:57,535 --> 01:22:59,957
You saved my life, darling.

1138
01:22:59,997 --> 01:23:03,796
Don't worry.
I don't want anything in return.

1139
01:23:03,875 --> 01:23:06,463
Just one thing.
Tell her to go away!

1140
01:23:07,670 --> 01:23:09,173
Go away!

1141
01:23:12,676 --> 01:23:15,265
Pepa, I'm ashamed.

1142
01:23:15,304 --> 01:23:18,601
I've treated you so badly.

1143
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:20,812
All I wanted was to talk to you.

1144
01:23:20,893 --> 01:23:23,315
I've spent two days waiting...

1145
01:23:23,353 --> 01:23:26,192
looking for you,
leaving messages.

1146
01:23:26,274 --> 01:23:28,236
We can talk tonight.

1147
01:23:28,318 --> 01:23:30,363
The trip to Stockholm can wait.

1148
01:23:30,445 --> 01:23:32,867
No. It's too late now.

1149
01:23:32,947 --> 01:23:34,450
Don't hold a grudge.

1150
01:23:34,490 --> 01:23:38,290
Let's have a drink,
now, in the cafeteria.

1151
01:23:40,204 --> 01:23:42,250
Yesterday... this morning,
or even at noon today...

1152
01:23:42,332 --> 01:23:44,169
we could have.

1153
01:23:44,208 --> 01:23:45,962
But now it's too late.

1154
01:23:46,045 --> 01:23:48,549
It's been too late
for the past two hours.

1155
01:23:48,630 --> 01:23:52,805
Then why did you come out here?

1156
01:23:52,885 --> 01:23:56,058
Lucia wanted to kill you...

1157
01:23:56,138 --> 01:24:00,271
and I came to stop her.

1158
01:24:00,351 --> 01:24:03,523
Since you're out of danger,
I'm leaving.

1159
01:24:05,230 --> 01:24:06,942
Good-bye.

1160
01:24:32,092 --> 01:24:33,845
Home at last!

1161
01:24:35,054 --> 01:24:37,058
The visitors...

1162
01:24:37,139 --> 01:24:39,394
are comfortable.

1163
01:24:39,474 --> 01:24:41,896
And the kids?

1164
01:24:41,936 --> 01:24:45,401
Candela really manages
to recover quickly.

1165
01:24:45,481 --> 01:24:48,195
Hope he's luckier for her
than the Shiites were.

1166
01:24:49,318 --> 01:24:51,114
God, what a mess!

1167
01:24:51,195 --> 01:24:53,366
The maid comes tomorrow.

1168
01:24:53,447 --> 01:24:56,370
Better wear shoes
with this mess.

1169
01:24:56,409 --> 01:24:58,746
I wonder which is better...

1170
01:24:58,787 --> 01:25:02,627
slipping on gazpacho,
or cutting myself on the glass.

1171
01:25:02,707 --> 01:25:06,715
The repairman is a doll, but
I'd better save him for Marisa.

1172
01:25:16,179 --> 01:25:18,684
I fell asleep.

1173
01:25:18,766 --> 01:25:20,102
How do you feel?

1174
01:25:20,183 --> 01:25:23,356
Like new. But you don't look so hot.

1175
01:25:23,437 --> 01:25:26,735
Well... I'm going to have a baby.

1176
01:25:26,774 --> 01:25:28,402
I didn't know.

1177
01:25:28,483 --> 01:25:30,654
You're the first person
I've told.

1178
01:25:30,736 --> 01:25:33,742
Congratulations!
You should sit here.

1179
01:25:39,454 --> 01:25:40,748
I'll explain tomorrow.

1180
01:25:40,789 --> 01:25:42,793
- But--
- Sit down.

1181
01:25:42,875 --> 01:25:46,841
You just woke up,
but I haven't slept in two days.

1182
01:25:48,629 --> 01:25:50,968
I won't sublet it.

1183
01:25:51,008 --> 01:25:52,762
I love the view.

1184
01:25:55,304 --> 01:25:57,266
Yeah, it's gorgeous.

1185
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:01,228
How long was I asleep?

1186
01:26:01,310 --> 01:26:03,105
Hours!

1187
01:26:03,145 --> 01:26:05,358
You have beautiful skin.

1188
01:26:07,149 --> 01:26:09,570
I had a dream.

1189
01:26:09,652 --> 01:26:12,282
- A good one?
- I think so.

1190
01:26:14,115 --> 01:26:16,578
I was a virgin this morning...

1191
01:26:16,659 --> 01:26:18,329
but I don't think I am now.

1192
01:26:18,411 --> 01:26:22,378
- Don't tell me one of these jerks--
- No. It was in my dream!

1193
01:26:22,457 --> 01:26:24,461
Great!

1194
01:26:24,501 --> 01:26:26,630
Actually, you've lost...

1195
01:26:26,670 --> 01:26:28,715
that hard look
that virgins have.

1196
01:26:28,798 --> 01:26:29,800
Virgins are awful.

1197
01:26:29,882 --> 01:26:39,025
If you were on stage
faking a cheap pain

1198
01:26:39,100 --> 01:26:42,022
Don't bother to act

1199
01:26:43,020 --> 01:26:46,945
I know that play

1200
01:26:47,024 --> 01:26:49,863
Liar

1201
01:26:49,944 --> 01:26:53,325
How well you fit that part

1202
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:58,540
It would seem after all

1203
01:26:58,619 --> 01:27:03,087
That's the way you are

1204
01:27:03,166 --> 01:27:07,466
I was blinded

1205
01:27:07,546 --> 01:27:12,097
By your passionate kisses

1206
01:27:12,175 --> 01:27:16,350
You lied coldly

1207
01:27:16,388 --> 01:27:20,730
But the curtain
finally came down

1208
01:27:22,394 --> 01:27:25,233
Playacting

1209
01:27:25,314 --> 01:27:29,697
That's what you do best

1210
01:27:29,735 --> 01:27:34,119
A finely rehearsed lie

1211
01:27:34,198 --> 01:27:38,498
A well-turned mockery

1212
01:27:38,578 --> 01:27:43,046
You outdid yourself

1213
01:27:43,082 --> 01:27:46,380
Destroying my heart

1214
01:27:47,420 --> 01:27:51,888
And now that your tears are for real

1215
01:27:51,967 --> 01:27:56,476
I only remember your lies

1216
01:27:56,555 --> 01:28:00,939
Forgive me
if I don't believe you

1217
01:28:01,018 --> 01:28:05,986
But I think
you're putting on a show

1218
01:28:06,065 --> 01:28:09,237
Don't forget that after all

1219
01:28:09,276 --> 01:28:11,489
I'm supposed to be in the wrong

1220
01:28:15,867 --> 01:28:19,248
Playacting

1221
01:28:19,287 --> 01:28:23,755
That's what you do best

1222
01:28:23,833 --> 01:28:27,048
A finely rehearsed lie

1223
01:28:28,129 --> 01:28:32,221
A well-turned mockery

1224
01:28:32,300 --> 01:28:36,768
You outdid yourself

1225
01:28:36,806 --> 01:28:40,939
Destroying my heart
