- Nice watch.
- Thanks.

9
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:36,788
- What's the water resistance?
- 200 meters.

10
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:38,923
- And it's got a date display?
- Yes, it does.

11
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,961
I might have gone for a metal strap
instead of a leather strap.

12
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,170
- Really?
- Yes.

13

I think I'd prefer a metal strap.

14
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:48,679
I've had this one for years.
It's as good as new.

15
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,806
- What's the water resistance?
- 100 meters.

16
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:52,812
- How long have you had it?
- Nine years.

17

A little bored of it, actually.

18
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,977
I've been thinking of getting a new one
for quite a while now.

19

Okay, this is what we'll do.
We'll go to the place where I bought mine.

20

If I tell them you're a colleague,
a friend,

they'll definitely give you a discount.

22

Both the owner and his father have been
patients of mine for some time,

23

Chicken wings or...

Yes, it's exactly what you think.

I'll be very quick.

717

You only have a few days to decide
who to kill. Once stage three kicks in,

you remember what stage three is?

that's stage three.

a matter of hours before they die.

Had you been drinking when you operated

Only a little. That had nothing to do

A surgeon never kills a patient.

An anesthesiologist can kill a patient

My husband told me
about you and your father.

Oh, he did? Did he also tell you

No.

Constantly flirting.

1031

To be honest, she's got feelings
for him, too.

1032

She thinks he has very nice hands.
Truth is, he's... he has beautiful hands.

All doctors have clean, nice,
beautiful hands.

with it if you wanna go ahead."

Dad! Bob's dying!

1390
01:48:51,859 --> 01:48:52,814
Dad.

1391
01:48:54,695 --> 01:48:55,684
Who's your best friend?

1392
01:48:57,489 --> 01:48:58,604
I don't know, Bob.

1393
01:49:05,622 --> 01:49:06,532
I have three.

1394
01:49:08,167 --> 01:49:09,577
Two boys and a girl in my class.

1395
01:49:11,795 --> 01:49:12,830
That's great, Bob.

1396
01:49:15,299 --> 01:49:16,459
It's good to have a lot of friends.

Bob's eyes are bleeding.

1399
01:49:55,589 --> 01:49:56,578
Come to the living room.

1400
01:49:57,841 --> 01:49:59,251
- Now?
- Yes.

1401
01:50:01,011 --> 01:50:01,921
Now.

1402
01:50:04,807 --> 01:50:06,138
Steven, where are the children?

1403
01:50:07,893 --> 01:50:08,882
They're already there.

1404
01:50:20,197 --> 01:50:22,279
I think I'm gonna wear
that black dress that you like.

1405
01:50:24,743 --> 01:50:27,826
Wear whatever you want. Just hurry.
