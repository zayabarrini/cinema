00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:19,436
DOGTOOTH

2
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:32,449
<i>Today the new words are the following:</i>

3
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:35,118
<i>Sea...</i>

4
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:38,372
<i>motorway...</i>

5
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:41,124
<i>excursion...</i>

6
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,044
<i>and carbine.</i>

7
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:53,095
<i>A sea is a leather armchair 
with wooden arms</i>

8
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:55,806
<i>like the one we have
in our living room.</i>

9
00:00:56,765 --> 00:01:01,311
<i>For example:
Don't stand on your feet.</i>

10
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:05,148
<i>Sit on the sea to have
a quiet chat with me.</i>

11
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:11,822
<i>A motorway is a very strong wind.</i>

12
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:20,455
<i>An excursion is a very resistant material...</i>

13
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:23,500
<i>used to construct floors.</i>

14
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:25,961
<i>For example:</i>

15
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:30,132
<i>The chandelier fell violently 
onto the floor...</i>

16
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,968
<i>but no damage was caused to it...</i>

17
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:36,805
<i>because it is made of 100% excursion.</i>

18
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:41,768
<i>Carbine.</i>

19
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:47,316
<i>A carbine is a beautiful white bird.</i>

20
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:58,368
I say we play a game of endurance.

21
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:04,041
By that I mean we run hot water
from the taps...

22
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:07,502
place a finger under the water...

23
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:11,798
and the one who lasts longest wins.

24
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,469
What do you think?

25
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,015
I like it.

26
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,352
- You?
- I like it as well.

27
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:27,022
Shall we use all the taps or just one?

28
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,733
We'll just use one if you like.

29
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,860
How will we time it?

30
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:36,073
With a clock or a stopwatch?

31
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:39,743
No need.
We'll put our fingers in together.

32
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:43,205
Last one to take their finger out wins.

33
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:47,834
So we need all three taps running?

34
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:52,255
We could do it with just one.

35
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:56,593
If we use three, someone might sneak
their finger out for a moment.

36
00:02:56,843 --> 00:03:01,264
We could use the bathtub.
It's bigger.

37
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:05,560
What should we call this game?

38
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:18,115
I don't know...

39
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:30,585
Do you like the music
or should I put something else on?

40
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:33,755
No, it's okay.

41
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:38,719
No need to be shy.
If you don't like it, let me know.

42
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:41,805
No, I do like it.

43
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,725
What's your favorite song?

44
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,148
I have two.

45
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:01,950
Have you taken a bath?

46
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:04,619
Yes.

47
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:06,621
Did you wash your hair?

48
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:12,002
Not my hair.
I washed it yesterday.

49
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:12,562
- Do you feel dizzy?
- No, I'm fine.

50
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:34,709
Are you done?

51
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,547
Christina is here.

52
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,698
- Hello, Christina.
- Hello.

53
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:13,743
You've lost weight.

54
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,246
Yes, a little.

55
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,332
Can I stay, or am I disturbing you?

56
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:22,919
Stay. You're not disturbing me in the least.

57
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:36,057
What are those things on your headband?

58
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,935
Sparkling stones.

59
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:40,937
Sparkling?

60
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:44,441
They shine in the dark,
like little lights.

61
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,027
Without any power?

62
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,362
Sure.

63
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,532
You're lying.

64
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:54,367
No, I'm not.

65
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,454
Where did you get it?

66
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,457
I made it myself.

67
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,375
Well done.

68
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,127
Thanks.

69
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:07,922
Do you have a headband?

70
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:11,134
A brown one.
But I gave it to my little sister.

71
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:15,138
She gave me a pair of socks
and two big rubber erasers.

72
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,640
Are those the socks?

73
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,893
No, another pair.

74
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:23,313
They're nice too.

75
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:24,606
Thanks.

76
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,321
Will you join us for dinner?

77
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:34,324
No, unfortunately I have to go.

78
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:37,619
Too bad. We're having burgers.

79
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:40,663
Burgers are one of my favorite meals.

80
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,086
What are the others?

81
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,174
I like fish soup and cheese pie.

82
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,843
Fish soup and cheese pie are perfect.

83
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:56,930
- I had fish soup yesterday.
- Lovely.

84
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:12,779
There's apple in the juice too.

85
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,364
It's very tasty.

86
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,120
Unfortunately, I have to go.

87
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,832
Shall I shoot a video
with all of us?

88
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,876
Go ahead, we don't have
a video with Christina.

89
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,712
Do you mind if we film us all together?

90
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,172
Not at all.

91
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:48,231
- Dad, can I sit next to Christina?
- Yes, honey.

92
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:59,868
Christina, can you smile a bit more?

93
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:27,770
<i>The sizes of the triangle angles
are 36, 77 and 67 degrees.</i>

94
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:32,108
<i>Side A has a length of 12.8 cm.</i>

95
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:36,279
<i>Side C has a length of 9.7 cm.</i>

96
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:40,283
<i>Find the area of the triangle,
the length of side B...</i>

97
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,951
<i>and the type of triangle.</i>

98
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,536
<i>Good luck.</i>

99
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:48,791
<i>The eyes of a fresh fish are not:</i>

100
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,044
<i>A) Bleary,</i>

101
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,879
<i>B) Big,</i>

102
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,256
<i>C) Red.</i>

103
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:56,966
<i>Good luck.</i>

104
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:05,141
<i>If for any reason
we are still awake at 11:00 p.m.,</i>

105
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,810
<i>what kind of procedure do we follow?</i>

106
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:10,980
<i>Good luck.</i>

107
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,955
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

108
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,708
- Shall I wait for you?
- Yes.

109
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:20,675
- How do I look?
- Just fine.

110
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:22,552
Now?

111
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,722
That's fine, too.

112
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:31,060
I don't think the skirt goes 
with this shirt.

113
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,817
- How many do you have?
- 37.

114
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:41,487
- You'll be caught if you cheat.
- I've got 37. And you?

115
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:42,822
52.

116
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,909
You might be the one with the most.

117
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,077
No way.

118
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:01,591
- More salad?
- No.

119
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:15,938
We're low on iodine 
and the antihistamines have expired.

120
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,232
Also, we need more bandages.

121
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:20,860
I'll give you a list.

122
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:24,697
- Whatever you like.
- And black tint for your eyebrows.

123
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:26,783
Didn't I get you some last week?

124
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:31,746
I used it all. I need more.
I can't use blue.

125
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,790
It would be unnatural.

126
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,463
I'll get you some.

127
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,967
- Do you want lemon?
- No, thanks.

128
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:50,556
We'll be out of meat soon.
You need to bring more.

129
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:55,812
Mom, could you pass me the phone? Please.

130
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:58,564
Thank you.

131
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:02,443
- Did you count your stickers?
- I have 76.

132
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:04,153
I have 52.

133
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,905
37.

134
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:09,492
Girls, you have to try harder.

135
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:12,161
Your brother is the winner again.

136
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:17,667
That means he selects tonight's entertainment.

137
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:20,628
But I have a surprise for you.

138
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:22,421
Something unprecedented.

139
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:26,843
The next prize will be
not one sticker, or two,

140
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,678
but ten.

141
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:31,514
So you must do your best.

142
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:34,350
You see how important it is.

143
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:36,102
Yes, absolutely.

144
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:40,189
The winner tells us
how we spend the evening.

145
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,441
I say video.

146
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,943
We haven't watched one in a long time.

147
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:45,695
It's a good opportunity.

148
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,379
<i>Dad, may I water the plants too?</i>

149
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:05,882
<i>Run!</i>

150
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,551
<i>Be careful, slow down.</i>

151
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,848
<i>Here, Dad, there's a dry herb.</i>

152
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:17,393
<i>This is the problem.
There are more in there.</i>

153
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:18,895
<i>Dad, there's an airplane!</i>

154
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:24,025
<i>Can you bring a wet cloth
from the kitchen?</i>

155
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,402
<i>Mom, where do we keep them?</i>

156
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:29,322
<i>Under the sink, in the cupboard.</i>

157
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:34,869
<i>Careful, don't bring a clean one.</i>

158
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:38,164
<i>Look out, maybe it'll fall.</i>

159
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:42,585
<i>Watch out!</i>

160
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:46,088
<i>Mom, that was great!
Let me take a look.</i>

161
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,546
I wash it much better than you.

162
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:33,094
I also clean the tires and floor mats.

163
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:39,308
And I never forget the air freshener. 
Only once.

164
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:44,897
It smelled nice and I thought
I'd used some...

165
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:46,607
already...

166
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:51,487
You rarely remembered it

167
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,657
and often didn't clean the mats

168
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:58,953
when they had tough stains,
like mud and tar.

169
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,666
I wish you'd see
that I wash it better than you.

170
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,836
You'd have cried if you'd seen that.

171
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,970
He's out at the fence again.

172
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:49,045
He started throwing rocks at me.

173
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,714
Your brother would never throw stones.

174
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,419
Not yet, I'll tell you when.

175
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:39,845
Hold on a while.

176
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:49,939
Now spit it out.

177
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:08,290
I wish it would fall.

178
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:12,253
If it falls, I'll get it.

179
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:17,550
Whoever deserves it will get it.

180
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,950
- Good morning.
- How are you, Christina?

181
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:45,578
Fine. My leg hurts a little.

182
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:48,080
When are you coming again?

183
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:52,293
I'll check the shifts.
Maybe one afternoon next week.

184
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,336
Do you wear the perfume I gave you?

185
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,173
Does it smell good?

186
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:58,591
It does.

187
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,509
Mr. Petrou called for you.

188
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,802
- Did you water the yucca?
- Two weeks ago.

189
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:46,722
- Do it every week.
- Yes, sir. Shall I call him?

190
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:48,891
- No, I'll go.
- Yes, sir.

191
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:01,987
My belly has been aching
since last night.

192
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,323
Where exactly does it hurt?

193
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:12,998
On the upper right side.
Could be an inflamed appendix.

194
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:16,085
The vermiform appendix
is lower down on the right.

195
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:24,760
- Here?
- No.

196
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,889
- Here?
- No.

197
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,600
- Does it hurt here?
- Yes.

198
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:36,522
- Avoid eating fruit and vegetables.
- I drank some milk.

199
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:40,693
It's okay.
You'd better not work out today.

200
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:44,113
- No medication?
- You don't need any.

201
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:48,033
Follow my instructions carefully
and you'll get well.

202
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:52,204
Otherwise your condition will deteriorate.

203
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:56,375
Get up. Can you play with me?

204
00:22:56,584 --> 00:22:58,627
We have about 20 minutes.

205
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:02,548
I have a new anesthetic.
Do you want to try it out?

206
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:03,883
Yes.

207
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:07,595
The one who wakes up first
will be the winner.

208
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:15,269
Don't put more on mine.

209
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:25,321
One, two, three.

210
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:08,989
It's nearly finished.
It needs floor tiles and lights.

211
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:11,825
I can't decide which one I prefer.

212
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:21,669
- I like these.
- I prefer those.

213
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:23,921
Those are nice too.

214
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:26,715
- How's your wife?
- Same.

215
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:29,968
- Do you go out?
- No.

216
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:33,889
I told you, you should.
Even if she's in a wheelchair.

217
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,809
She's unwell.
And she doesn't like visitors.

218
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:40,729
I've told her hundreds of times
to invite you for a beer.

219
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:42,189
I understand.

220
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:44,733
It's tragic what happened to her.

221
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:47,361
It requires great psychological strength.

222
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:50,572
In the picture, she looks energetic.

223
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:52,491
She was a volleyball champion?

224
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,742
Handball.

225
00:24:57,413 --> 00:24:58,706
These you said?

226
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:01,000
Yes. The others are nice too.

227
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:38,287
Hi, honey.

228
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:42,541
I had a meeting. A meeting, yes.

229
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:46,628
Did they go out? Or work out?

230
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:50,632
Why, what's the matter?
Her belly or her stomach?

231
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:52,634
Yes, it's cold outside.

232
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:35,928
I'd like my dog back.

233
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:44,269
Sorry, I can't do that.

234
00:26:44,478 --> 00:26:48,524
He's still on the second stage
of his training.

235
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:52,444
I'll show you.

236
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,956
First stage, second stage-

237
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:05,707
where your dog is-

238
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:08,710
third, fourth, fifth and final stage.

239
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:19,012
Let me explain.

240
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:21,515
Dogs are like clay

241
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:26,145
and our job here is to mold them.

242
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,356
A dog may be energetic,

243
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:34,319
a fighter, cowardly, or gentle.

244
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:41,076
All this requires work, patience
and care from us.

245
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:44,913
Every dog is waiting for us

246
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,541
to show it how it should behave.

247
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,586
Do you understand?

248
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:53,505
So the issue here

249
00:27:53,714 --> 00:27:58,760
is to decide together
how we want your dog to behave.

250
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:04,391
Do we want an animal
or do we want a friend?

251
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:11,106
Do we want a guard
who will respect us as his masters

252
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:15,402
and do unhesitatingly 
whatever we ask of him?

253
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:17,946
You see?

254
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:19,448
Sure.

255
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:30,792
Rex!

256
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:34,546
Rex!

257
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:43,425
1 minute 15 seconds.

258
00:30:56,897 --> 00:30:58,023
2 minutes.

259
00:31:05,072 --> 00:31:06,531
2 minutes 30 seconds.

260
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:11,620
2 minutes 45 seconds.

261
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,089
3 minutes 15 seconds.

262
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,391
3 minutes 45 seconds.

263
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,161
4 minutes 30 seconds.

264
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:03,755
5 minutes 15 seconds.

265
00:32:09,511 --> 00:32:11,346
Five minutes 30 seconds.

266
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:50,570
What do you mean you can't?

267
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,782
I'm sorry.

268
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:58,119
We're doing this for you,
not for me.

269
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:59,704
I'm sorry.

270
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:04,793
Try again but use your tongue.
There's no point otherwise.

271
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:16,471
Don't tell Dad.

272
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:19,224
- Do you feel disgusted?
- No.

273
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:20,976
Then what?

274
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:25,438
I prefer what we did last time.

275
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:42,289
Hello.

276
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,626
What are you doing?

277
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:50,672
Cleaning the carpet to keep germs off it.

278
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:06,521
- Do you want this headband?
- Yes, very much.

279
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:09,024
What are you going to give me?

280
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:17,699
How about this pencil?
It has an eraser on it.

281
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:18,950
No.

282
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:27,125
A tape measure?

283
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:31,212
You press here and it reels in by itself.

284
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:33,048
No.

285
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:48,146
Come closer and lick for a while
and the headband is yours.

286
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,191
Are you disgusted?

287
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:52,650
No.

288
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:21,262
- Do you want to dance?
- I don't feel like it.

289
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:26,434
Besides, we don't have time.
We have to go meet Mom.

290
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:30,772
Mom will be late. 
She's talking to herself again in her room.

291
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:33,566
Are you afraid of Mom talking to herself?

292
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:34,901
Not at all.

293
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,528
- You are afraid.
- I'm not.

294
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:38,446
- You are.
- No.

295
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:42,367
You can't hear her.
She might be talking about you.

296
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:43,952
Stop it.

297
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:53,420
If I give you a present,
will you lick me?

298
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:55,964
- What kind of present?
- A headband.

299
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:57,590
I already have one.

300
00:36:57,799 --> 00:37:00,260
This one sparkles in the dark.

301
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,303
What do you mean by sparkles?

302
00:37:03,096 --> 00:37:04,264
It lights up.

303
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,599
Where did you get it?

304
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:08,309
I can't tell you.

305
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:11,730
Do our parents know
you have a headband like that?

306
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:16,609
So, it could easily be yours.

307
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,572
What do you want me to lick?

308
00:37:22,282 --> 00:37:23,491
My shoulder.

309
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:42,135
Can you get some chocolate
if you pass by the shop?

310
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:45,180
Don't go out of your way.

311
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:49,684
Any kind.

312
00:37:58,151 --> 00:37:59,194
Me too.

313
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:07,220
That isn't yours.

314
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:10,014
Leave me alone.

315
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:25,214
- Does it still hurt?
- Yes.

316
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:32,388
You could ask Dad to get in the car
and fetch it for you.

317
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:35,224
That's what I'd do if I were you.

318
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,018
It's the only way.

319
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:42,690
Dad!

320
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:49,948
The eldest threw the airplane
over the fence.

321
00:40:50,198 --> 00:40:52,617
- Where?
- There, on the road.

322
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:55,119
I'll try.

323
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:23,351
How did it happen?

324
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:26,437
What did you tell them?

325
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:30,066
You did the right thing.

326
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:32,401
I'll tell them as well.

327
00:43:33,361 --> 00:43:36,239
Yes, it's a good opportunity.

328
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:37,740
<i>Yes.</i>

329
00:43:39,492 --> 00:43:43,037
<i>The temperature will rise
and the wind will drop.</i>

330
00:43:45,665 --> 00:43:47,834
<i>Five or six degrees.</i>

331
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:50,545
<i>All right.</i>

332
00:43:52,505 --> 00:43:57,260
<i>No, it's time to put an end to this.
It's exhausting for everyone.</i>

333
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:03,182
<i>I agree. You're absolutely right.</i>

334
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:05,017
<i>Yes.</i>

335
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:31,794
Your brother is dead.

336
00:44:33,588 --> 00:44:36,883
A creature like the one in the garden 
tore him apart.

337
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:39,302
On the one hand,

338
00:44:39,552 --> 00:44:43,931
he made a huge mistake,
venturing out ill-prepared.

339
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:50,104
On the other hand, he was my son 
and I feel sorry for him.

340
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:54,108
The animal that threatens us is a "cat":

341
00:44:54,317 --> 00:44:56,277
the most dangerous animal there is.

342
00:44:56,944 --> 00:45:00,781
It eats meat,
children's flesh in particular.

343
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,951
After lacerating its victim
with its claws,

344
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:05,995
it devours them with sharp teeth.

345
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:08,331
The face and whole body of the victim.

346
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:12,793
If you stay inside, you are protected.

347
00:45:13,753 --> 00:45:16,088
We have to be ready

348
00:45:16,297 --> 00:45:20,301
in case it invades the house or the garden.

349
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,730
Our dear brother...

350
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:21,362
we are all very sorry that you failed 
to exterminate the cat...

351
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:23,823
<i>like I did.</i>

352
00:46:25,074 --> 00:46:26,993
<i>We are going to miss you...</i>

353
00:46:28,536 --> 00:46:30,830
<i>even though you made many mistakes.</i>

354
00:46:38,713 --> 00:46:40,381
<i>It's a real pity</i>

355
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:43,718
<i>that it happened to you</i>

356
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:48,889
<i>and that I couldn't use my knowledge 
to save you.</i>

357
00:46:56,397 --> 00:47:00,735
<i>My brother, I never expected...</i>

358
00:47:01,861 --> 00:47:05,406
<i>that things would turn out this way.</i>

359
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:12,455
<i>I hoped you'd manage to survive
with the supplies I procured.</i>

360
00:47:13,873 --> 00:47:16,250
<i>But the dangers are many.</i>

361
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:19,128
<i>I am very sad.</i>

362
00:47:22,757 --> 00:47:26,052
Push three times on the chest.
Forcefully.

363
00:47:26,594 --> 00:47:27,636
One,

364
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:29,138
two,

365
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:30,431
three.

366
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:33,476
Afterwards you close her nose,

367
00:47:33,726 --> 00:47:36,604
open her mouth and blow.

368
00:48:47,675 --> 00:48:49,218
I'm pregnant.

369
00:48:50,136 --> 00:48:54,181
One boy, one girl. Twins.

370
00:48:54,515 --> 00:48:56,016
Two boys?

371
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:59,061
No, a boy and a girl.

372
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:00,896
Are you sure?

373
00:49:01,147 --> 00:49:02,189
Yes.

374
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:03,732
Triplets?

375
00:49:05,693 --> 00:49:07,570
That's a bit much.

376
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:11,365
You're right, twins.

377
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:16,871
Turn round, do the same thing.

378
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:32,261
Turn round, do the same thing.

379
00:49:42,188 --> 00:49:43,606
Okay.

380
00:49:48,569 --> 00:49:49,737
Dive in.

381
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:58,120
Ready.

382
00:49:59,038 --> 00:50:01,874
One, two, three, go.

383
00:50:18,224 --> 00:50:19,141
<i>In a few months,</i>

384
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:22,603
<i>your mother will give birth
to two children and a dog.</i>

385
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:28,067
<i>Some of you might not like this</i>

386
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:31,237
<i>because they'll be sharing their room,</i>

387
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:33,739
<i>their clothes, or even their toys.</i>

388
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:35,449
<i>However,</i>

389
00:50:35,616 --> 00:50:37,451
<i>look on the bright side:</i>

390
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:39,828
<i>you'll have two more people
to support you,</i>

391
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:41,622
<i>the family will be bigger.</i>

392
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:45,501
<i>Let's all applaud your mother
in anticipation of this gift.</i>

393
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:58,264
I don't want to share my room.

394
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:01,642
If you behave, 
you won't have to share with anyone.

395
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:03,102
I will.

396
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:06,146
I don't want to share my room either.

397
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:11,360
<i>If I see improvements 
in your behavior and performance...</i>

398
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:13,988
<i>I might avoid giving birth.</i>

399
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:18,450
<i>But if things remain the same,
you give me no choice.</i>

400
00:51:19,285 --> 00:51:22,204
<i>As for the dog,
I don't want to hear a thing.</i>

401
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:25,499
<i>I'll give birth as soon as possible.</i>

402
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:37,386
Well done, honey.
I mean well done, everyone.

403
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:40,014
Dry yourself. Come and pick a prize.

404
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:45,519
Don't touch it with wet hands
or it won't stick afterwards.

405
00:51:47,021 --> 00:51:48,355
One more thing.

406
00:51:48,689 --> 00:51:51,567
Your performance was worse
than last time.

407
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:53,193
I need say no more.

408
00:51:55,988 --> 00:51:57,990
Oh, there's an airplane.

409
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:03,495
It fell in the garden.

410
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:46,580
No, not that much. It hurts.

411
00:52:48,916 --> 00:52:50,125
This much?

412
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:51,460
Less.

413
00:52:55,923 --> 00:52:57,466
This much?

414
00:52:59,385 --> 00:53:00,594
That's it.

415
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:12,815
Do you want me to lick you,
then you'll give me a present?

416
00:53:13,065 --> 00:53:14,775
I have nothing to give you.

417
00:53:16,652 --> 00:53:18,112
It doesn't matter.

418
00:53:32,793 --> 00:53:34,586
This is a good spot.

419
00:54:02,948 --> 00:54:03,824
Good morning, Dad.

420
00:54:03,991 --> 00:54:05,993
How many hours did you sleep?

421
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,494
About nine.

422
00:54:25,471 --> 00:54:28,807
<i>I lost you and my spring departed</i>

423
00:54:29,725 --> 00:54:33,187
<i>Filled with sorrow the stars 
and the birds cry</i>

424
00:54:33,854 --> 00:54:38,525
<i>Gray is the dusk and gray my soul</i>

425
00:54:39,193 --> 00:54:43,155
<i>And all is sorrowful
because you are lost</i>

426
00:54:44,656 --> 00:54:52,331
<i>Where are you now, my love</i>

427
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:54,124
Mind the little toe!

428
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:58,462
<i>Where are you roaming</i>

429
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:01,882
<i>For all of this time</i>

430
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:10,891
<i>Where are you now, my love</i>

431
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:15,771
<i>I search and search for you</i>

432
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:19,942
<i>Yet I do not find you</i>

433
00:56:00,941 --> 00:56:02,776
Dad!

434
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:06,905
There are two fish in the pool.

435
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:07,823
What kind?

436
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:11,577
Sea bream, I think.
But I'm not sure.

437
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:13,328
You must come and catch them.

438
00:56:13,579 --> 00:56:16,582
Mom will be happy if I'm right.

439
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:19,459
Give me a minute and I'll come.

440
00:56:41,148 --> 00:56:42,816
There are three.

441
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:47,362
They were two a minute ago.
Probably the other one came later.

442
00:57:12,721 --> 00:57:15,223
The most creative years of a man?

443
00:57:15,474 --> 00:57:17,309
Between 30 and 40.

444
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:19,811
And of a woman?

445
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:21,480
Between 20 and 30.

446
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:25,067
A child is ready to leave the house...

447
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:27,069
When the right dogtooth comes out.

448
00:57:27,319 --> 00:57:29,488
Or the left. No matter.

449
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:31,823
Only then is your body ready

450
00:57:32,032 --> 00:57:33,700
to face the dangers that lurk.

451
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:37,704
To leave the house and be safe outside,

452
00:57:37,913 --> 00:57:39,706
we must take the car.

453
00:57:40,415 --> 00:57:42,542
When are we ready to learn to drive?

454
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:45,379
When the right dogtooth grows again.

455
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:47,714
Or the left, it doesn't matter.

456
00:57:50,509 --> 00:57:52,177
Mom, what's a pussy?

457
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:55,347
Where did you hear that word?

458
00:57:55,722 --> 00:57:58,558
I saw it on a video case,
on top of the VCR.

459
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:03,855
A pussy is a big light.

460
00:58:04,106 --> 00:58:05,774
For example:

461
00:58:06,566 --> 00:58:11,571
The pussy is switched off,
the room plunges into darkness.

462
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:21,206
Do you want to hear
your grandfather sing?

463
00:58:21,415 --> 00:58:22,207
Yes!

464
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:01,788
Dad loves us.

465
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:05,542
Mom loves us.

466
00:59:07,753 --> 00:59:09,629
Do we love them?

467
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:11,423
Yes, we do.

468
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:14,217
I love my brothers and sisters...

469
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:17,596
because they love me as well.

470
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:21,725
The spring is flooding my house...

471
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:25,479
the spring is flooding...

472
00:59:27,147 --> 00:59:28,899
my little heart.

473
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:35,155
My parents are proud of me...

474
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:38,492
because I'm doing just fine.

475
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:45,499
I'm doing just fine,
but I will always try harder.

476
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:51,671
My house, you are beautiful
and I love you...

477
00:59:53,757 --> 00:59:55,300
and I will never...

478
00:59:59,346 --> 01:00:00,347
ever leave you.

479
01:00:46,017 --> 01:00:48,353
I saw you in my dreams the other day.

480
01:00:49,396 --> 01:00:52,148
I was in the woods with your dad.

481
01:00:52,357 --> 01:00:56,570
In the evening we had a fire
and roasted potatoes for dinner.

482
01:00:56,736 --> 01:01:00,031
Suddenly we heard a weird sound
behind a bush.

483
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,909
It was you... and you were a zombie.

484
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:07,163
Your father threw rocks at you.
So did I.

485
01:01:07,372 --> 01:01:10,208
- But we couldn't hit you.
- What was I?

486
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:12,085
A zombie.

487
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:15,422
- Do you know what a zombie is?
- I do.

488
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:18,758
- Do you have dreams?
- I do.

489
01:01:20,051 --> 01:01:22,387
Tell me about one you had lately.

490
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:26,933
Mom fell into the pool.

491
01:01:27,184 --> 01:01:28,602
And then?

492
01:01:29,186 --> 01:01:30,687
Nothing. Just that.

493
01:01:37,611 --> 01:01:40,697
I brought you another present.
Hair gel.

494
01:01:40,906 --> 01:01:43,950
You put it on your hair,
to shape it.

495
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:53,460
I don't like it.

496
01:01:54,419 --> 01:01:55,462
What do you mean?

497
01:01:55,629 --> 01:01:58,924
I don't like this present.
Anyway I don't believe you.

498
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:02,594
You told me your headband sparkled
and it wasn't true.

499
01:02:02,802 --> 01:02:05,138
It was! No way doesn't it sparkle.

500
01:02:05,305 --> 01:02:07,223
Maybe you did something wrong.

501
01:02:07,432 --> 01:02:08,808
I don't believe you.

502
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:10,143
Look.

503
01:02:14,773 --> 01:02:15,941
Look at me.

504
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:20,320
Look.

505
01:02:27,661 --> 01:02:31,498
If you want me to lick you,
I need a better present.

506
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:33,250
I don't have anything else.

507
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:42,676
I want these.

508
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:45,261
I can't give you those.

509
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:48,306
- I want them.
- It isn't possible.

510
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:50,183
In that case, get out.

511
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:52,352
I can't give them to you.

512
01:02:52,519 --> 01:02:55,313
Get out.
I'm not going to lick you again.

513
01:02:56,481 --> 01:03:00,026
And I'll tell my parents
you brought me a sparkling headband.

514
01:03:00,276 --> 01:03:02,195
And that you told me to lick

515
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:05,323
your keyboard down there.

516
01:03:05,824 --> 01:03:09,995
Do you know what Dad will do
if he finds out I lick your keyboard?

517
01:03:27,137 --> 01:03:30,724
Please, you have to give them
back to me next week.

518
01:03:46,573 --> 01:03:48,533
Mom, what's a zombie?

519
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:56,249
Where did you hear that word?

520
01:03:56,416 --> 01:03:58,335
I don't remember. Probably Dad.

521
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:08,678
A zombie is a small yellow flower.

522
01:05:30,802 --> 01:05:32,303
What are you doing here?

523
01:05:32,512 --> 01:05:35,682
I couldn't sleep, Dad.
I felt very tense.

524
01:05:37,475 --> 01:05:38,685
I'm afraid.

525
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:43,022
As long as you don't go 
into the garden alone, you're safe.

526
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:46,317
Would I let you come to any harm?

527
01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:52,824
Dad, I want to learn to fight.

528
01:05:53,533 --> 01:05:55,535
What was that? I can't hear you.

529
01:05:56,786 --> 01:05:58,872
When will I learn how to fight?

530
01:06:00,123 --> 01:06:02,459
Can you turn your robot off?

531
01:06:02,876 --> 01:06:06,212
I fight so you don't have to.

532
01:06:06,713 --> 01:06:10,008
I want you to use your head
for something else...

533
01:06:11,551 --> 01:06:15,013
other than a punching bag, like me.

534
01:06:17,307 --> 01:06:20,018
Your head doesn't look 
like a punching bag.

535
01:06:20,477 --> 01:06:21,728
No.

536
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:24,522
This is good, thanks.

537
01:06:26,524 --> 01:06:28,735
It looks like a baseball glove.

538
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:31,237
You're a smart-ass, aren't you?

539
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:35,909
Mr. Balboa, Mr. Creed on the phone.

540
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:10,068
There are all types of shark.

541
01:07:10,944 --> 01:07:12,570
Hammer shark...

542
01:07:12,779 --> 01:07:15,865
blue, mako and white shark.

543
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:21,621
The chances of the imbeciles
getting the right one...

544
01:07:23,581 --> 01:07:26,626
These types of shark aren't found here.

545
01:07:27,126 --> 01:07:29,254
It's very unlikely.

546
01:07:35,301 --> 01:07:38,721
I don't mean that it isn't 
the shark we're looking for.

547
01:07:39,639 --> 01:07:41,641
It probably is, Martin.

548
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:44,060
It's a man-eater!

549
01:08:01,995 --> 01:08:04,289
It's a man-eater!

550
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:23,683
Its jaws are different
from the bites on the victim.

551
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:27,103
I want to be sure
and you want to be sure.

552
01:08:27,687 --> 01:08:30,189
We want to be sure, don't we?

553
01:08:45,371 --> 01:08:47,123
Anybody else seen them?

554
01:08:47,332 --> 01:08:48,291
No.

555
01:08:51,044 --> 01:08:53,004
Get me the duct tape.

556
01:09:54,941 --> 01:09:57,443
I want you to call me Bruce.

557
01:09:57,944 --> 01:09:59,445
What's Bruce?

558
01:09:59,946 --> 01:10:01,280
It's a name.

559
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:04,575
Every time you say Bruce, I'll turn.

560
01:10:05,118 --> 01:10:07,245
I want a name like that too.

561
01:10:07,954 --> 01:10:12,125
Take your pick.
You can have any name you like.

562
01:10:13,918 --> 01:10:16,087
I want you to call me "back".

563
01:10:16,921 --> 01:10:18,756
You can't be called that.

564
01:10:18,965 --> 01:10:20,717
We call our back, back.

565
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:28,808
Bruce!

566
01:10:31,102 --> 01:10:32,270
Bruce!

567
01:10:42,739 --> 01:10:43,781
Bruce!

568
01:10:46,993 --> 01:10:48,161
Bruce!

569
01:10:55,585 --> 01:11:00,506
It's nice. My wife and I 
thought your house would be like this.

570
01:11:00,673 --> 01:11:01,924
Thanks.

571
01:11:03,342 --> 01:11:05,094
Where's the perfume I got you?

572
01:11:05,303 --> 01:11:06,637
In the bathroom.

573
01:11:07,221 --> 01:11:09,348
It's very good perfume.

574
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:13,519
My wife absolutely insisted
on getting you that one.

575
01:11:13,686 --> 01:11:15,521
We thought of getting you a vase

576
01:11:15,730 --> 01:11:20,067
but we thought it wouldn't match the house, 
so we chose perfume.

577
01:11:22,695 --> 01:11:24,697
Do you live here alone?

578
01:11:24,906 --> 01:11:28,034
Yes. My parents are on the fourth floor.

579
01:12:04,237 --> 01:12:08,908
I hope your kids have bad influences
and develop a bad personality.

580
01:12:09,075 --> 01:12:10,952
I wish this with all my heart.

581
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:14,497
As punishment for the evil
you have caused my family.

582
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:46,320
She hit my leg with a hammer.

583
01:12:46,612 --> 01:12:48,281
He's lying! It wasn't me.

584
01:12:48,447 --> 01:12:52,785
I came in and saw a cat with a hammer
jumping out the window.

585
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:55,121
She did it.

586
01:12:55,329 --> 01:12:57,290
You're hallucinating from the pain.

587
01:12:57,498 --> 01:13:00,167
You'll need analgesics and a plaster.

588
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:02,461
I bet it's broken, Dad.

589
01:13:12,346 --> 01:13:14,181
Did you do what we said?

590
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:16,183
Did you take precautions?

591
01:13:16,475 --> 01:13:18,394
He didn't have time, Dad.

592
01:13:18,644 --> 01:13:21,188
From what I saw, it was very quick.

593
01:13:21,564 --> 01:13:23,065
Really quick.

594
01:13:28,029 --> 01:13:31,991
You devote less time to the kids.

595
01:13:32,199 --> 01:13:35,661
Don't cry.
The kids might see you crying.

596
01:13:36,662 --> 01:13:38,748
Haven't you combed today?

597
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:42,043
I have.

598
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:49,175
I had a tough day.

599
01:13:56,349 --> 01:13:59,852
We have to find someone
to replace Christina.

600
01:14:03,689 --> 01:14:08,027
You can't trust anyone anymore.

601
01:14:09,028 --> 01:14:12,198
Nobody else will enter this house.

602
01:14:12,698 --> 01:14:17,870
I'm considering assigning the task
to the elder one.

603
01:14:18,037 --> 01:14:20,873
Then again he could make 
his own mind up.

604
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:23,292
That's probably better.

605
01:19:08,994 --> 01:19:13,040
Do that again, bitch,
and I'll rip your guts out.

606
01:19:16,043 --> 01:19:18,337
I swear on my daughter's life

607
01:19:18,504 --> 01:19:22,174
that you and your clan

608
01:19:22,383 --> 01:19:25,344
won't last long in this neighborhood.

609
01:19:34,395 --> 01:19:35,521
Mom!

610
01:19:38,107 --> 01:19:40,025
I found two little zombies!

611
01:19:42,695 --> 01:19:44,363
Shall I bring them to you?

612
01:19:48,867 --> 01:19:49,952
Mom!

613
01:19:54,081 --> 01:19:55,249
Mom!

614
01:21:16,789 --> 01:21:18,290
It's our wedding anniversary.

615
01:21:18,499 --> 01:21:21,835
We'll celebrate by eating cakes

616
01:21:22,044 --> 01:21:25,547
and decorating the house
with balloons and lights.

617
01:21:29,968 --> 01:21:31,512
Sit up a bit.

618
01:21:39,144 --> 01:21:41,480
I think my dogtooth is moving.

619
01:21:47,986 --> 01:21:50,989
You're imagining things.
It isn't moving at all.

620
01:21:59,748 --> 01:22:02,418
- Did you sleep well last night?
- Great.

621
01:23:13,447 --> 01:23:16,325
Dad I'm tired. Can I stop?

622
01:23:16,575 --> 01:23:19,119
Sure, honey, if you can't go on.

623
01:24:49,835 --> 01:24:51,169
Enough.

624
01:28:42,901 --> 01:28:45,487
Dad, will you give me the harpoon gun?

625
01:28:47,072 --> 01:28:49,783
I've told you,
the harpoon gun is dangerous.

626
01:28:50,242 --> 01:28:52,118
I can lick your ear if you want.

627
01:30:36,222 --> 01:30:37,265
Bruce!

628
01:30:40,936 --> 01:30:42,270
Bruce!

629
01:31:28,733 --> 01:31:30,568
I'll go get the dog tomorrow.

630
01:31:31,653 --> 01:31:34,572
The fifth level will be finished
by now for sure.

631
01:31:41,996 --> 01:31:46,751
Either drink the orange juice while it's fresh 
or don't drink it at all.
