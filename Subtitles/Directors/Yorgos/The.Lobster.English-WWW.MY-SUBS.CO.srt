2
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:07,572
I'm really sorry.

3
00:02:07,573 --> 00:02:09,884
Does he wear glasses or contact lens?

4
00:02:11,357 --> 00:02:12,657
Glasses.

5
00:02:31,056 --> 00:02:33,495
You would have to hurry up.

6
00:02:48,591 --> 00:02:52,643
<i>He decided his brown leather
shoes were the best pair to wear.</i>

7
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:56,857
<i>His back hurt a little, but not
like some other time in the past...</i>

8
00:02:56,858 --> 00:02:58,507
<i>when the pain was intolerable.</i>

9
00:03:02,526 --> 00:03:06,133
<i>He was thinking his wife doesn't
love him at all anymore.</i>

10
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,348
<i>He didn't burst into tear
and he didn't think...</i>

11
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:11,703
<i>things most people do...</i>

12
00:03:11,704 --> 00:03:15,469
<i>when they realise someone doesn't
love them anymore is cry.</i>

13
00:03:19,993 --> 00:03:22,943
Sir, would you mind take a look
into the camera here for me?

14
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,675
That's ok, thank you.

15
00:03:32,447 --> 00:03:35,922
Have you ever been on your own before?
No, never.

16
00:03:36,332 --> 00:03:38,598
Are you allergic to any food?
No.

17
00:03:39,929 --> 00:03:42,108
Your last relationship last how many years?

18
00:03:42,109 --> 00:03:43,409
Around 12.

19
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:48,181
Do you remember how long exactly sir?
Eleven years and seven months.

20
00:03:49,805 --> 00:03:52,294
Sexual preference?
Women.

21
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:57,317
However I had one homosexual experience...

22
00:03:57,318 --> 00:03:59,749
in the past, in college.

23
00:04:00,438 --> 00:04:03,320
Is there bisexual option available?

24
00:04:03,321 --> 00:04:07,076
No sir, this option is no longer
available since about last summer...

25
00:04:07,077 --> 00:04:09,429
due to several operational problems

26
00:04:09,788 --> 00:04:12,462
I'm afraid you have yo decide right now
if you want to be registered as...

27
00:04:12,463 --> 00:04:14,468
homosexual or heterosexual

28
00:04:24,177 --> 00:04:26,994
I think I should be
registered as heterosexual.

29
00:04:28,006 --> 00:04:30,393
Any children sir?
No.

30
00:04:30,394 --> 00:04:31,694
And dog?

31
00:04:31,695 --> 00:04:34,831
My brother, he was here couple of
years ago, but he didn't make it.

32
00:04:34,832 --> 00:04:36,295
You might remember him.

33
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:40,808
Medium built, 48 years old,
bald patch, blond hair

34
00:04:40,809 --> 00:04:42,754
I'm afraid no sir.

35
00:04:43,577 --> 00:04:46,482
Ok, I like you to write your
name clearly on this form.

36
00:04:46,763 --> 00:04:49,913
In capital letter and sign please.

37
00:04:55,774 --> 00:04:57,827
Very good, thank you very much.

38
00:04:58,813 --> 00:05:02,749
So, you're not allow to use
volley-ball or tennis court.

39
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,584
These are only for the couples.

40
00:05:04,585 --> 00:05:08,853
You can use facility for individual
sports such as squash and golf.

41
00:05:08,854 --> 00:05:11,533
You can stay at hotel for up to 45 days.

42
00:05:11,534 --> 00:05:13,103
You would be staying at the single room.

43
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:16,043
If everything goes well and you make it,
you would be moved to a double room

44
00:05:34,905 --> 00:05:38,225
I'm afraid you can't keep any
of your personal belongings.

45
00:05:38,543 --> 00:05:40,399
We will provide everything
you need as far as...

46
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,186
garments, accessories,
and shoes are concerned.

47
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:47,371
You can keep this
Thank you.

48
00:05:47,372 --> 00:05:50,280
Shoe size please
44 and a half

49
00:05:50,281 --> 00:05:53,263
44 or 45? there's no half sizes

50
00:05:54,912 --> 00:05:56,212
45

51
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:16,956
If you need a hair cut, call reception
one day ahead, smoking is not allowed.

52
00:06:16,957 --> 00:06:20,392
That you would be able to run for longer
during the hunt without getting tired...

53
00:06:20,393 --> 00:06:22,757
and you breath won't smell when you kiss.

54
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,975
Enjoy your stay.

55
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:28,950
Excuse me.

56
00:06:28,951 --> 00:06:32,796
If we need to get hair cut, we must call
reception a day before, is that right?

57
00:06:32,797 --> 00:06:34,491
That's right
Great.

58
00:06:44,898 --> 00:06:47,760
<i>His room number was 101.</i>

59
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:51,591
<i>A tranqulizer gun...</i>

60
00:06:51,592 --> 00:06:53,894
<i>was hanging on the wall above his bed.</i>

61
00:06:56,543 --> 00:06:59,817
<i>On the table were 20 tranquilzer darts...</i>

62
00:06:59,818 --> 00:07:03,880
<i>a black plastic watch, a
pair of sunglasses...</i>

63
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:06,248
<i>and a cologne for man.</i>

64
00:07:08,167 --> 00:07:12,200
<i>Inside the wardrobe were four
identical grey trousers...</i>

65
00:07:12,201 --> 00:07:16,401
<i>four identical button down
shirts in white and blue...</i>

66
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:20,154
<i>a belt, socks, underwear, a blazer...</i>

67
00:07:20,155 --> 00:07:23,444
<i>a striped tie and a white bathrobe.</i>

68
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:32,545
<i>He looked out of window.</i>

69
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,886
<i>The unconscious bodies
of captured loners...</i>

70
00:07:35,887 --> 00:07:38,283
<i>were lying on the wet ground.</i>

71
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:43,320
<i>"Thank God they wear those water
proof ponchos", he thought.</i>

72
00:07:44,176 --> 00:07:46,674
Room 195.

73
00:07:47,576 --> 00:07:50,121
Two loners, two extra days.

74
00:07:52,434 --> 00:07:55,207
Room 272.

75
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:58,770
One loner, one extra day.

76
00:08:12,264 --> 00:08:16,147
Hello, I'm the hotel manager, and
this gentleman is my partner.

77
00:08:16,148 --> 00:08:18,024
We like to welcome you.

78
00:08:18,025 --> 00:08:19,501
You're one of the lucky one.

79
00:08:19,502 --> 00:08:22,127
You have one of our supreme room
which means you have a view.

80
00:08:22,799 --> 00:08:25,023
Did you read the lease list
Yes it is.

81
00:08:25,024 --> 00:08:26,324
Very good.

82
00:08:26,325 --> 00:08:28,105
Now the fact you turning into a animal...

83
00:08:28,106 --> 00:08:30,656
if you fail to fall in love with
someone during your stay here...

84
00:08:30,657 --> 00:08:33,898
is not something should
upset you or get you down.

85
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:35,299
Just think as a animal...

86
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,485
you have a second chance
to find a companion.

87
00:08:37,486 --> 00:08:39,722
But even then you must be careful.

88
00:08:39,723 --> 00:08:42,614
You need to choose a companion
that is similar type animal...

89
00:08:42,615 --> 00:08:43,915
to you.

90
00:08:44,325 --> 00:08:46,987
A wolf and a penguin can
never live together.

91
00:08:46,988 --> 00:08:49,569
Nor a camel and a hippopotamus.

92
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,983
That would be absurd, think about it

93
00:08:54,087 --> 00:08:57,289
I understand this discussion
is a little unpleasant for you.

94
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:59,393
But it is my duty to prepare you...

95
00:08:59,394 --> 00:09:02,043
psychologically for all possible outcomes.

96
00:09:02,756 --> 00:09:05,415
Now have you thought of what animal
you like to be if end up alone?

97
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:07,331
Yes, a lobster.

98
00:09:07,332 --> 00:09:12,123
Why a lobster? Because lobster
live for over one hundred years.

99
00:09:12,979 --> 00:09:16,511
Are blue blood like aristocrat...

100
00:09:17,784 --> 00:09:21,350
and stay fertile all their life

101
00:09:21,351 --> 00:09:25,736
I also like the sea very much

102
00:09:25,737 --> 00:09:29,257
I water ski, swim quite
well since I was a teenager

103
00:09:30,412 --> 00:09:33,660
I must congratulate you, the first
thing most people think of is a dog...

104
00:09:33,661 --> 00:09:36,257
which is why the world is full of dogs.

105
00:09:36,258 --> 00:09:38,139
Very few people choose unusual animal...

106
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,781
which is why they are in danger.

107
00:09:39,782 --> 00:09:41,854
A lobster is a excellent choice.

108
00:09:41,855 --> 00:09:43,705
Could you stand for us please?

109
00:09:49,873 --> 00:09:52,057
This is to show you how easy life is...

110
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:54,313
when there are two of something
rather than just one.

111
00:09:54,314 --> 00:09:56,785
We tend to forget that from time to time.

112
00:09:56,786 --> 00:09:59,514
The handcuff will be removed
the same time tomorrow

113
00:09:59,575 --> 00:10:00,875
I'm sorry bob.

114
00:10:00,876 --> 00:10:02,512
Hope you enjoy staying with us.

115
00:10:02,513 --> 00:10:03,813
Goodbye.

116
00:10:14,805 --> 00:10:16,588
Have a good day.

117
00:11:09,763 --> 00:11:11,063
Good morning.

118
00:11:11,064 --> 00:11:16,290
Room 101, 44 days left.

119
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:18,698
Breakfast is served.

120
00:11:42,133 --> 00:11:45,202
<i>His first day was one he never forget.</i>

121
00:11:49,286 --> 00:11:52,145
<i>Near his table of breakfast
sat a young women...</i>

122
00:11:52,146 --> 00:11:54,075
<i>with her head tilted back.</i>

123
00:11:54,076 --> 00:11:55,645
<i>Later he would learn...</i>

124
00:11:55,646 --> 00:11:57,829
<i>she often got nose bleed.</i>

125
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:00,558
<i>Next to her sat her best friend.</i>

126
00:12:04,343 --> 00:12:07,030
<i>He thanked the waiter who
served his coffee...</i>

127
00:12:07,031 --> 00:12:09,840
<i>and thought about his wife for a moment.</i>

128
00:12:11,195 --> 00:12:13,934
<i>A woman who seems to like butter biscuit...</i>

129
00:12:13,935 --> 00:12:15,716
<i>offered one to a man drinking...</i>

130
00:12:15,717 --> 00:12:17,989
<i>a Compari soda for breakfast.</i>

131
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,684
<i>He then looked behind him saw a woman...</i>

132
00:12:23,685 --> 00:12:27,861
<i>who would later find out
was absolutely heartless.</i>

133
00:12:30,289 --> 00:12:32,634
<i>And some others in the couple's area...</i>

134
00:12:32,635 --> 00:12:35,710
<i>whom he may never meet
druing his stay at the hotel.</i>

135
00:12:38,836 --> 00:12:41,515
<i>That morning he was really hungry.</i>

136
00:12:41,516 --> 00:12:43,919
<i>He could eat a whole chicken...</i>

137
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,149
<i>but ate almost nothing.</i>

138
00:12:46,497 --> 00:12:48,844
Hello
Hello

139
00:12:48,845 --> 00:12:51,777
I decided to go for a walk
ouside with my new friend.

140
00:12:51,778 --> 00:12:53,307
Let me introduce you.

141
00:12:53,308 --> 00:12:57,277
This is Robert, he stay in the
room next to mine had a lisp.

142
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:00,630
Please to meet you, I stay in the room 101

143
00:13:00,631 --> 00:13:04,288
I'm on the same floor, 186.

144
00:13:04,289 --> 00:13:07,058
Would you like to join us?
Why not.

145
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:27,736
One of these days gonna be
me on one of those yachts.

146
00:13:27,737 --> 00:13:29,419
Why those yachts?

147
00:13:30,105 --> 00:13:32,005
The final ordeal before letting you go.

148
00:13:32,006 --> 00:13:33,306
The hardest one

149
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:38,679
15 days of vacation just a couple
alone, didn't you read the leaflet?

150
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,980
I did.

151
00:13:42,031 --> 00:13:44,018
Did you see John's leg?

152
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:45,691
No

153
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:48,916
John, could you show your leg?

154
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,861
Oh yeah.

155
00:13:58,645 --> 00:14:01,504
Room 187, day 2.

156
00:14:05,408 --> 00:14:06,745
Hello everyone.

157
00:14:09,795 --> 00:14:12,313
My mother was left on her own when my
father fell in love with a woman...

158
00:14:12,314 --> 00:14:15,129
who was better at math than she was.

159
00:14:16,341 --> 00:14:18,551
She has postgraduate degree, I think.

160
00:14:18,552 --> 00:14:21,077
While my mother only a graduate

161
00:14:21,993 --> 00:14:23,515
I was 19 at the time.

162
00:14:25,994 --> 00:14:29,954
My mother entered the hotel but didn't
make it and was turning into a wolf

163
00:14:29,955 --> 00:14:32,032
I really miss her

164
00:14:33,465 --> 00:14:35,430
I found out she's been moved to a zoo

165
00:14:35,431 --> 00:14:37,843
I often went there to see her

166
00:14:38,771 --> 00:14:40,755
I give her raw meat

167
00:14:41,189 --> 00:14:43,106
I knew the wolf like raw meat.

168
00:14:43,107 --> 00:14:45,209
But I couldn't figure out which
of the wolves was my mother.

169
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:47,897
So I used to give a little
bit to each of them.

170
00:14:50,206 --> 00:14:52,816
One day I decided to enter the enclosure

171
00:14:54,468 --> 00:14:56,692
I really missed her and I wanted a hug

172
00:14:57,882 --> 00:15:00,119
I climbed the fence and jumped in.

173
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,126
All the wolves charged
at once and attacked me.

174
00:15:03,893 --> 00:15:06,554
All but two stood motionless

175
00:15:06,555 --> 00:15:09,882
I guess one of those two must be my mother.

176
00:15:12,282 --> 00:15:16,321
The zoo guard got to me quite
quickly and took me to the hospital.

177
00:15:16,322 --> 00:15:18,265
Thankfully I didn't lose my leg

178
00:15:18,266 --> 00:15:20,526
I just had this limp.

179
00:15:20,527 --> 00:15:22,609
Which also is my defining characteristic.

180
00:15:23,497 --> 00:15:25,995
My wife died six days ago.

181
00:15:26,543 --> 00:15:29,272
She was very beautiful
and I love her very much.

182
00:15:30,328 --> 00:15:32,672
She had limp too.

183
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,485
Thank you John, you can return to you seat.

184
00:15:48,137 --> 00:15:52,583
Let's move on to our next
guest, room 104, day 2.

185
00:15:59,905 --> 00:16:02,245
Hello everyone.

186
00:16:03,236 --> 00:16:05,691
This is only my second day here.

187
00:16:05,692 --> 00:16:09,103
But already I feel like a
member of wonderful group.

188
00:16:09,104 --> 00:16:13,955
My defining characteristic is
that I have very beautiful smile.

189
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:34,357
<i>Something's gotten hold of my heart.</i>

190
00:16:34,358 --> 00:16:39,619
<i>Keeping my soul and my senses apart.</i>

191
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:43,591
<i>Something's gotten into my life.</i>

192
00:16:43,592 --> 00:16:45,565
Have you ever dance with anybody?

193
00:16:45,566 --> 00:16:46,866
Sorry?

194
00:16:46,867 --> 00:16:49,242
Have you ever dance with anybody?

195
00:16:49,243 --> 00:16:50,543
Yes.

196
00:16:52,917 --> 00:16:54,882
What sort of dancing you should do?

197
00:16:57,084 --> 00:16:59,296
Just depends on the music.

198
00:17:00,081 --> 00:17:01,853
Do you need to sit down?

199
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,971
No, no, I'm getting ready to dance.

200
00:17:09,033 --> 00:17:10,715
Can I sit here?

201
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:14,933
I'm sorry.

202
00:17:22,929 --> 00:17:25,168
Can I sit here?
Of course.

203
00:17:27,763 --> 00:17:30,174
Let me introduce you to my best friend.

204
00:17:32,296 --> 00:17:35,868
That woman you were talking
to have no feeling whatsoever.

205
00:17:35,869 --> 00:17:39,433
She feels nothing at all
She's the best hunter in hotel.

206
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:41,259
Silent and very fast.

207
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,181
She's the women record holder

208
00:17:43,182 --> 00:17:45,063
192 captors.

209
00:17:45,891 --> 00:17:50,383
<i>Changing the grey, changing the blue.</i>

210
00:17:50,384 --> 00:17:52,683
<i>Scarlet for me...</i>

211
00:17:52,684 --> 00:17:56,479
<i>it's scarlet for you</i>

212
00:18:13,111 --> 00:18:16,171
<i>if this is the real thing.</i>

213
00:18:34,971 --> 00:18:36,171
Would you like to dance?

214
00:18:36,562 --> 00:18:39,519
<i>Every day yeah.</i>

215
00:18:39,859 --> 00:18:44,443
<i>You touch me and my mind goes astray yeah.</i>

216
00:18:44,444 --> 00:18:48,846
<i>And baby, and Baby.</i>

217
00:18:48,847 --> 00:18:53,173
<i>And baby, and Baby.</i>

218
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:56,769
<i>Something's gotten hold of my heart.</i>

219
00:18:56,770 --> 00:19:01,673
<i>Dragging my soul to a beautiful land.</i>

220
00:19:02,211 --> 00:19:05,858
<i>Something's gotten into my life</i>

221
00:19:07,123 --> 00:19:09,690
I'm sorry, I got the blood on your shirt.

222
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:12,904
But don't worry, there are many ways
to remove blood stain from clothing.

223
00:19:12,905 --> 00:19:16,924
One way is to wring the clothes to
cold water, then rub in sea salt.

224
00:19:16,925 --> 00:19:20,116
Another way is to srape the stain
with cotton ball dip in ammonia.

225
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:23,167
The third way is to make flour
mold into a paste like toothpaste.

226
00:19:23,168 --> 00:19:25,968
Especially it the clothes are
delicate or bright color.

227
00:19:25,969 --> 00:19:28,768
But juse never use warm
water on blood, ever.

228
00:19:29,505 --> 00:19:30,805
Ok.

229
00:19:32,497 --> 00:19:35,716
<i>But then you, you, you.</i>

230
00:19:35,997 --> 00:19:37,980
<i>You came my way.</i>

231
00:19:37,981 --> 00:19:40,318
<i>But then you came my way.</i>

232
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:43,404
<i>And a feeling unknown shook my heart...</i>

233
00:19:43,405 --> 00:19:45,877
<i>make me want you to stay</i>

234
00:19:45,878 --> 00:19:50,841
<i>all of my nights and all of my days</i>

235
00:19:50,842 --> 00:19:52,783
I think I have to rest for a little bit.

236
00:19:52,897 --> 00:19:54,940
My leg hurts
That's ok.

237
00:19:54,941 --> 00:19:58,360
But let me know when you feel
better, and we can dance again.

238
00:19:58,361 --> 00:20:01,684
<i>Keeping my soul and my senses apart.</i>

239
00:20:02,694 --> 00:20:06,460
<i>Something has invaded my light.</i>

240
00:20:06,461 --> 00:20:10,869
<i>Painting my sleep with
the colours so bright.</i>

241
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:15,123
<i>Changing the gray changing the blue.</i>

242
00:20:15,124 --> 00:20:17,615
<i>Scarlet for me</i>

243
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:23,589
<i>it's scarlet for you.</i>

244
00:20:35,168 --> 00:20:37,161
Leave the building in orderly fashion.

245
00:20:37,505 --> 00:20:39,899
Do hurry up, and please be carefully

246
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,046
no one should get hurt or injured...

247
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,800
and good luck with the hunt

248
00:20:51,694 --> 00:20:53,474
I wish I didn't have this limp

249
00:20:55,117 --> 00:20:57,443
I used to good at running, but not anymore

250
00:20:58,171 --> 00:21:00,429
I'm sure would be slower than them.

251
00:21:00,834 --> 00:21:04,521
If I were you, I think of some trick
that choose element of surprise...

252
00:21:05,187 --> 00:21:06,967
instead of speed.

253
00:21:07,783 --> 00:21:09,083
You're right.

254
00:21:09,959 --> 00:21:11,259
That's what I would do.

255
00:22:25,966 --> 00:22:30,534
<i>Back when you loved me.</i>

256
00:22:30,535 --> 00:22:34,298
<i>You asked me one morning
while we were talking</i>

257
00:22:34,684 --> 00:22:38,269
<i>"what was life about?"</i>

258
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:42,455
<i>I turned and told you
for some it's the wine</i>

259
00:22:42,456 --> 00:22:45,521
<i>for some it's the glory</i>

260
00:22:45,522 --> 00:22:48,777
<i>for some it's being rich</i>

261
00:22:48,935 --> 00:22:53,167
<i>but for me it is only you</i>

262
00:22:53,168 --> 00:22:57,400
<i>for some it's the glory</i>

263
00:22:58,153 --> 00:23:03,615
<i>for some it's being rich</i>

264
00:23:03,616 --> 00:23:09,079
<i>but for me it is only you.</i>

265
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:29,537
<i>Now that your heart has changed.</i>

266
00:23:29,538 --> 00:23:32,388
<i>And you love someone else.</i>

267
00:23:32,527 --> 00:23:35,140
<i>You still wonder what they're saying.</i>

268
00:23:35,141 --> 00:23:39,099
<i>How my own heart beats.</i>

269
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:44,721
<i>Are there perhaps more
people like me exist.</i>

270
00:23:44,722 --> 00:23:48,060
<i>Dead on the inside.</i>

271
00:23:48,061 --> 00:23:51,400
<i>Alive on the outside.</i>

272
00:23:51,702 --> 00:23:57,583
<i>Dead on the inside.</i>

273
00:23:57,584 --> 00:24:03,465
<i>Alive on the outside.</i>

274
00:24:24,946 --> 00:24:26,695
Room 186.

275
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:29,306
One loner, one extra day

276
00:24:29,685 --> 00:24:33,141
38 days left, plus one, 39.

277
00:24:34,953 --> 00:24:37,033
Room 180.

278
00:24:37,485 --> 00:24:40,141
The day of your stay remain unchanged.

279
00:24:41,711 --> 00:24:43,642
Room 290.

280
00:24:45,096 --> 00:24:47,521
Four loners, four extra days

281
00:24:48,269 --> 00:24:53,411
154 days left, plus four, 158.

282
00:24:55,099 --> 00:24:56,973
Room 101.

283
00:24:57,256 --> 00:24:59,878
The day of your stay remain unchanged

284
00:25:01,697 --> 00:25:04,205
32 days left.

285
00:25:04,206 --> 00:25:06,604
Breakfast is served.

286
00:25:14,099 --> 00:25:16,038
Man eats alone.

287
00:25:37,428 --> 00:25:40,441
How many darts did you use yesterday?
12.

288
00:25:46,938 --> 00:25:49,960
Please take off your
trousers and sit on the bed.

289
00:25:50,428 --> 00:25:51,959
Can we not do this today?

290
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,260
It's awful

291
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:57,178
I know, but I'm afraid we have to do it.

292
00:25:57,179 --> 00:26:00,042
And you have no idea how much
it help you psychologically...

293
00:26:00,043 --> 00:26:01,343
in your search for partner.

294
00:26:02,025 --> 00:26:04,046
Man eats with woman

295
00:26:26,196 --> 00:26:29,075
ls your room number 186?
Yes it is

296
00:26:32,499 --> 00:26:35,110
I imagine you know
masturbation is not permitted

297
00:26:35,122 --> 00:26:37,371
in the room or any other
area of the hotel.

298
00:26:37,711 --> 00:26:39,011
Yes.

299
00:26:39,012 --> 00:26:42,274
And yet, it is been brought to my
attention you continue to do it.

300
00:26:45,101 --> 00:26:48,853
Today, you became erect quicker
than other days, that's good.

301
00:26:48,854 --> 00:26:51,306
Please, just a little longer.

302
00:26:51,307 --> 00:26:52,607
Have a good day.

303
00:26:52,608 --> 00:26:55,003
That's awful, just awful.

304
00:26:55,204 --> 00:26:57,897
Are you looking at the photograph
while you masturbating?

305
00:26:57,898 --> 00:26:59,198
Yes.

306
00:26:59,798 --> 00:27:01,595
What does the photograph show?

307
00:27:04,911 --> 00:27:07,559
A naked woman on a horse in the country.

308
00:27:08,287 --> 00:27:11,983
If I were in your shoes I would not be
ogling the naked woman but the horse

309
00:27:12,237 --> 00:27:14,756
I'm sure that horse's once
a weak and cowardly man...

310
00:27:14,757 --> 00:27:16,057
just like you.

311
00:27:16,265 --> 00:27:18,203
Woman walks alone.

312
00:27:26,409 --> 00:27:27,709
Help.

313
00:27:28,011 --> 00:27:29,992
This is not necessary, please...

314
00:27:31,393 --> 00:27:34,455
It was a accident, I just get carry away.

315
00:27:34,456 --> 00:27:36,073
This is not necessary
Please.

316
00:27:36,074 --> 00:27:38,733
Please place your hand on the toaster
This could be a warning

317
00:27:39,673 --> 00:27:42,496
I've been good otherwise, I...

318
00:27:52,677 --> 00:27:53,977
I'm sorry

319
00:27:53,978 --> 00:27:55,622
I'm sorry, please.

320
00:27:55,623 --> 00:27:58,146
Please, please, I'm sorry.

321
00:27:59,076 --> 00:28:00,889
Woman walks with man.

322
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:32,274
What they do as soon as
you enter the room...

323
00:28:32,275 --> 00:28:34,692
is to wash you body and
your head really well.

324
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:36,478
How did you know?

325
00:28:36,893 --> 00:28:39,872
My uncle used to know a
waiter who worked here.

326
00:28:39,873 --> 00:28:41,564
The waiter know the procedure.

327
00:28:41,565 --> 00:28:43,414
They are not allow to inside that room.

328
00:28:43,415 --> 00:28:46,766
Nevertheless, they peel off the skin...

329
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:49,799
which has become soft due
to the watering and soap.

330
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:55,722
Afterward they remove the heart, the eyes
and other vital organs of the body...

331
00:28:55,723 --> 00:28:57,187
with laser or scalpels.

332
00:28:58,713 --> 00:29:02,198
Then the procedure changes according
to the animal one has choosen.

333
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:04,376
That makes total sense

334
00:29:05,032 --> 00:29:09,094
I mean I suppose mammals demand
different kind of work than...

335
00:29:09,435 --> 00:29:12,368
fowl, for example
Exactly.

336
00:29:12,369 --> 00:29:14,813
Afterward they throw
remaining body parts of

337
00:29:14,825 --> 00:29:17,172
the carcass outside the
hotel restaurant...

338
00:29:17,173 --> 00:29:19,898
and distribute the blood to
the hospital in the city.

339
00:29:19,899 --> 00:29:21,600
Why is that.

340
00:29:21,601 --> 00:29:25,215
The blood is used for surgery where
there aren't blood donor available.

341
00:29:30,609 --> 00:29:33,290
New guests arrived yesterday
Yes I saw them

342
00:29:33,291 --> 00:29:34,958
I think I saw a woman with limp.

343
00:29:35,211 --> 00:29:36,626
It is just sprained ankle.

344
00:29:38,214 --> 00:29:40,143
She would be walking normally
again after a few days.

345
00:29:40,367 --> 00:29:41,667
That's a shame.

346
00:29:43,265 --> 00:29:45,363
It's a shame indeed.

347
00:29:50,048 --> 00:29:54,528
<i>One night on the coach, he sat next
to woman who like butter biscuit.</i>

348
00:29:55,163 --> 00:29:59,262
<i>He gazed out of the window, not
looking at anything in particular.</i>

349
00:29:59,263 --> 00:30:02,047
<i>Just trying avoid talking to her.</i>

350
00:30:02,048 --> 00:30:04,847
How is Bob?
He is fine.

351
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:08,605
Give anything to go for a walk
with you and Bob one afternoon.

352
00:30:09,582 --> 00:30:12,233
The dogs are not allow
there's a rule, I'm afraid.

353
00:30:12,484 --> 00:30:16,680
<i>"There are some excuses no one
can't argue with", he thought.</i>

354
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:20,005
<i>Some excuses without a
doubt better than others.</i>

355
00:30:20,006 --> 00:30:22,245
<i>That was really good one.</i>

356
00:30:24,975 --> 00:30:26,846
These biscuits are for Bob

357
00:30:26,847 --> 00:30:30,471
I want you to give them to him whenever
you want to reward him for something.

358
00:30:30,472 --> 00:30:32,799
Tell him it is from me
Thank you.

359
00:30:33,385 --> 00:30:36,083
Can I come to your room sometime for a chat

360
00:30:36,331 --> 00:30:38,096
I could give you a blow job.

361
00:30:38,097 --> 00:30:40,245
Or you could just fuck me

362
00:30:40,584 --> 00:30:42,841
I always swallow after
fellatio and absolutely

363
00:30:42,853 --> 00:30:45,219
have no problem with anal
sex if that's you thing.

364
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,632
My ex-husband always used to said that

365
00:30:47,633 --> 00:30:50,378
I have the most beautiful size he's
ever see, but let's not talk about him.

366
00:30:50,379 --> 00:30:54,385
My room number is 180, so my
telephone extension is 180.

367
00:30:55,773 --> 00:30:57,692
Hope catch some loners tonight.

368
00:30:57,693 --> 00:30:59,942
Haven't caught any the last few nights.

369
00:31:00,821 --> 00:31:02,784
Hope you catch lots too.

370
00:31:02,785 --> 00:31:04,094
Thank you very much.

371
00:31:07,884 --> 00:31:10,151
If I don't find a suitable partner soon

372
00:31:10,152 --> 00:31:13,133
I'm gonna kill myself by throwing
myself out of one of room.

373
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,404
Out the window

374
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,100
I want you to know that.

375
00:31:20,053 --> 00:31:21,677
My room is on the first floor.

376
00:31:21,982 --> 00:31:24,206
<i>"I hope catch some loners today"...</i>

377
00:31:24,207 --> 00:31:25,507
<i>she said.</i>

378
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:27,821
<i>"And I hope you catch lots too".</i>

379
00:31:27,822 --> 00:31:30,171
<i>She then told him that if she didn't...</i>

380
00:31:30,172 --> 00:31:31,769
<i>find suitable partner soon.</i>

381
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:35,923
<i>She was going to kill herself by
jumping from one of room windows</i>

382
00:31:37,121 --> 00:31:39,199
<i>320, maybe.</i>

383
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:44,162
<i>Or one higher up, 480,
that would be even better.</i>

384
00:31:44,163 --> 00:31:46,604
<i>When she stop talking.</i>

385
00:31:46,605 --> 00:31:50,181
<i>He stare at her blankly,
not knowing what to say.</i>

386
00:31:51,232 --> 00:31:54,388
<i>Him then look out of the
woods, thought once more...</i>

387
00:31:54,389 --> 00:31:56,630
<i>how good his excuse's been.</i>

388
00:31:59,056 --> 00:32:01,275
Not bad, a bit higher.

389
00:32:04,437 --> 00:32:08,560
You thought about what animal you
wanna be if you don't make it?

390
00:32:09,202 --> 00:32:10,662
A lobster

391
00:32:18,817 --> 00:32:21,803
I'm gonna be a parrot if I don't make it.

392
00:32:25,177 --> 00:32:29,238
Why don't you become parrot
too, then we all be together?

393
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:30,936
You're complete idiot.

394
00:32:30,937 --> 00:32:32,812
Picking one of few animals that can talk...

395
00:32:32,813 --> 00:32:34,283
when you have a speech impediment.

396
00:32:34,284 --> 00:32:36,143
You're lisp even as a animal.

397
00:32:36,144 --> 00:32:40,139
As for you, they will catch you and put you
in a pot of boiling water until you die.

398
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,745
And then crack open you claws
with a tool by prying it,

399
00:32:42,757 --> 00:32:45,374
then suck up what little flesh
you have with their mouth.

400
00:32:45,375 --> 00:32:47,515
You're pathetic, both of you

401
00:32:49,048 --> 00:32:52,363
I'm not gonna be turning into some
animal, I'll come visit you though...

402
00:32:52,617 --> 00:32:55,591
with my patner, then we walking
together in some park of...

403
00:32:55,592 --> 00:32:59,474
where we swimming in the sea
when we're on one of our trip.

404
00:33:07,067 --> 00:33:08,367
Friends.

405
00:33:15,167 --> 00:33:16,864
Room 187 please.

406
00:33:20,143 --> 00:33:25,266
It's not coincidence that targets are
shape like single people and not couples.

407
00:34:08,744 --> 00:34:10,044
Hello.

408
00:34:11,191 --> 00:34:13,756
Hello
You swimsuit is very nice.

409
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:19,164
Thank you very much
You're welcome.

410
00:34:20,539 --> 00:34:24,343
Do you like to swim breaststroke,
front row, batterfly or backstroke?

411
00:34:24,344 --> 00:34:26,248
I like all sorts equally.

412
00:34:26,249 --> 00:34:28,059
You know I love breaststroke.

413
00:34:28,509 --> 00:34:30,504
Oh really, my friends
often teased me, said...

414
00:34:30,505 --> 00:34:32,266
"stop swimming breaststroke
all the time"...

415
00:34:32,267 --> 00:34:33,567
and they laughed.

416
00:34:34,721 --> 00:34:36,133
Breaststroke is great.

417
00:34:36,134 --> 00:34:38,459
It's excellent exercise for the back.

418
00:35:07,033 --> 00:35:11,194
When swimming breaststroke, men
shouldn't wear swimming shorts...

419
00:35:11,748 --> 00:35:14,389
has really limit movement in the buttocks.

420
00:35:15,141 --> 00:35:16,513
But you know that, didn't you?

421
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:18,164
I think your nose is bleeding.

422
00:35:18,165 --> 00:35:19,465
Really?

423
00:35:21,666 --> 00:35:22,966
Oh no.

424
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,544
This happen to me all the time.

425
00:35:28,455 --> 00:35:30,900
It's really, really annoying

426
00:35:30,901 --> 00:35:33,779
I know, I have nose bleeding problem too

427
00:35:46,902 --> 00:35:49,883
I saw what you did, must have hurt.

428
00:35:58,013 --> 00:35:59,473
Is it coming out.

429
00:36:01,815 --> 00:36:03,115
No.

430
00:36:06,043 --> 00:36:07,343
Yes.

431
00:36:07,344 --> 00:36:09,151
Can I use the tissue
Yes.

432
00:36:12,553 --> 00:36:15,299
Can I ask you a question, I
want you to answer me honestly.

433
00:36:16,526 --> 00:36:20,101
What's worse? To die of cold
and hunger in the woods.

434
00:36:20,102 --> 00:36:23,593
To become a animal would be killed
or eaten by some big animal.

435
00:36:23,594 --> 00:36:26,282
Or have nose bleed from time to time.

436
00:36:28,009 --> 00:36:31,186
To become a animal would be killed
or eaten by some big animal.

437
00:36:31,187 --> 00:36:32,487
Exactly.

438
00:36:32,488 --> 00:36:35,180
She isn't suspect you're lying?
No

439
00:36:43,699 --> 00:36:46,784
I'm very happy because
we have a new couple.

440
00:36:46,785 --> 00:36:48,331
They met just two days ago.

441
00:36:48,332 --> 00:36:51,327
But they very much in
love and perfect suited.

442
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:53,227
They both have same
problem with their noses.

443
00:36:53,228 --> 00:36:55,093
They bleed quite suddenly.

444
00:37:00,021 --> 00:37:02,284
Tomorrow they will be
transfer to a double room...

445
00:37:02,285 --> 00:37:04,819
with larger wardrobe and larger bathroom.

446
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:07,335
They will remain in the
double room for two weeks...

447
00:37:07,336 --> 00:37:10,525
and then been transferred to the
yacht for the further two weeks.

448
00:37:10,526 --> 00:37:14,539
We wish you every success and hope
you return to the city as a couple

449
00:37:18,165 --> 00:37:21,359
I'm very happy
Me too.

450
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,660
Congratulation.

451
00:37:22,661 --> 00:37:25,003
The course of your relationship
will be monitored closely...

452
00:37:25,004 --> 00:37:27,997
by our stuffs and by me personally.

453
00:37:27,998 --> 00:37:31,311
If you encounter any problems,
any tensions, any arguing...

454
00:37:31,312 --> 00:37:33,043
that you can't resolve yourselves.

455
00:37:33,044 --> 00:37:34,344
You would be asign children.

456
00:37:34,345 --> 00:37:36,363
That usually helps a lot.

457
00:37:50,423 --> 00:37:51,723
Good morning.

458
00:37:51,924 --> 00:37:56,593
Room 101, 7 days left.

459
00:37:56,594 --> 00:37:58,863
Breakfast is served.

460
00:38:39,728 --> 00:38:42,550
You have really nice hair

461
00:38:42,551 --> 00:38:43,851
I know.

462
00:38:44,647 --> 00:38:45,947
Look.

463
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:54,854
How do you like mine?

464
00:38:57,208 --> 00:38:59,047
I think yours quite dry hair.

465
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:01,075
Color is ok though.

466
00:39:01,855 --> 00:39:04,266
The most important thing
is that you're not bald.

467
00:39:05,234 --> 00:39:10,483
However when comes to men, bald is
always the possibility you can't avoid

468
00:39:10,484 --> 00:39:12,965
ls your father bald?
No he isn't.

469
00:39:12,966 --> 00:39:15,242
And even if somedays I lose my hair.

470
00:39:15,243 --> 00:39:17,657
There are things I can
do to get my hair back

471
00:39:17,658 --> 00:39:19,217
I can have a hair transplant.

472
00:39:19,218 --> 00:39:21,140
You always can tell someone
had a hair transplant

473
00:39:21,141 --> 00:39:23,836
I know
Nice hair is not something you can get.

474
00:39:23,837 --> 00:39:25,741
It's something you born with.

475
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:30,179
The fact your father isn't
bald shouldn't put you at ease.

476
00:39:32,645 --> 00:39:35,323
Have you decided what you're
going to do in your last day?

477
00:39:39,013 --> 00:39:40,729
I'm still thinking about it.

478
00:39:44,538 --> 00:39:46,281
Morning ladies.

479
00:39:52,727 --> 00:39:56,160
So, today is your last day.

480
00:39:56,161 --> 00:39:58,160
And as the customary, you can choose...

481
00:39:58,161 --> 00:39:59,978
how you like to spend your last night.

482
00:39:59,979 --> 00:40:02,849
What I always said in this
situation is it would

483
00:40:02,861 --> 00:40:05,567
be wise to do something
you can't do as animal.

484
00:40:05,568 --> 00:40:08,299
For example read a work
of classic literature...

485
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,311
or sing a song you really like.

486
00:40:10,312 --> 00:40:12,464
It would be silly to choose...

487
00:40:12,465 --> 00:40:15,347
for example, a walking the ground...

488
00:40:15,931 --> 00:40:18,620
or have sex intercourse
with another person,

489
00:40:18,632 --> 00:40:20,853
those are things you
can do as animal.

490
00:40:21,995 --> 00:40:24,434
But first, your best friend
is reading something...

491
00:40:24,435 --> 00:40:27,656
she like to read you,
it's really very touching.

492
00:40:30,362 --> 00:40:32,503
We always sat together at school...

493
00:40:32,504 --> 00:40:34,044
and whenever I had a problem...

494
00:40:34,045 --> 00:40:37,098
I told you about it because you
always give the best advice.

495
00:40:37,699 --> 00:40:39,484
When we didn't manage to find...

496
00:40:39,485 --> 00:40:40,950
dance partner at the school prom.

497
00:40:40,951 --> 00:40:44,278
The fact we were together at that
difficult moment give me strength

498
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,583
I'm sorry things come to this

499
00:40:47,584 --> 00:40:49,915
I'm sure if you have a few more days.

500
00:40:49,916 --> 00:40:54,267
You would find someone just like I did,
because you're a adorable person...

501
00:40:54,268 --> 00:40:57,358
and you have very beautiful
hair and very nice breath

502
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:59,263
I'm always jealous of your hair...

503
00:40:59,264 --> 00:41:00,264
you know that.

504
00:41:00,265 --> 00:41:03,100
You were, are, and always
will be my best friend.

505
00:41:03,101 --> 00:41:07,630
And I'll think of you often, and I'll
always wear those silver earing...

506
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:09,635
you give me for my birthday

507
00:41:09,636 --> 00:41:11,281
I'll miss you.

508
00:41:11,282 --> 00:41:13,575
And However many new girl
friends I make in a few days...

509
00:41:13,576 --> 00:41:16,122
when I move back into the city

510
00:41:16,123 --> 00:41:18,698
I don't think I'll find another as true...

511
00:41:21,971 --> 00:41:23,946
I like to ask for the ¡Stand By Me¡·...

512
00:41:23,947 --> 00:41:26,324
with River Phoenix, Kiefer Sutherland...

513
00:41:26,325 --> 00:41:28,488
and Richard Dreyfuss, alone.

514
00:41:28,489 --> 00:41:30,074
Excellent choice.

515
00:41:30,075 --> 00:41:31,541
Lovely film.

516
00:41:49,843 --> 00:41:52,636
Please leave a message.

517
00:41:54,196 --> 00:41:55,496
Hello.

518
00:41:55,497 --> 00:41:59,035
You're probably in the bathroom,
that's why you can't hear phone ring.

519
00:41:59,449 --> 00:42:01,834
Nothing like a cold shower in the morning.

520
00:42:02,435 --> 00:42:08,153
Well, I'll call you a little bit
later after you finish your shower.

521
00:42:08,154 --> 00:42:10,008
We'll talk later.

522
00:42:10,875 --> 00:42:12,175
Bye.

523
00:42:19,249 --> 00:42:21,608
<i>One day, as he was playing golf.</i>

524
00:42:21,609 --> 00:42:24,440
<i>He thought that it is
more difficult to pretend</i>

525
00:42:24,452 --> 00:42:26,703
<i>you do have feelings
when you don't...</i>

526
00:42:26,704 --> 00:42:29,745
<i>than to pretend you don't
have feelings when you do.</i>

527
00:42:31,401 --> 00:42:34,291
<i>He also thought that he like her accent</i>

528
00:42:34,292 --> 00:42:37,687
<i>and he always prefer woman with short hair.</i>

529
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:40,677
<i>So he decided she was the one.</i>

530
00:42:41,203 --> 00:42:44,339
<i>During the hunt, he would followed her.</i>

531
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:47,215
<i>And as soon as she shot a
loner, he would said to her:</i>

532
00:42:47,216 --> 00:42:49,225
<i>"I wish we have real gun..."</i>

533
00:42:49,226 --> 00:42:51,765
<i>instead of this silly tranquilizer one...</i>

534
00:42:51,766 --> 00:42:54,801
<i>"why don't you kill him
with your bare hands?"</i>

535
00:42:54,802 --> 00:42:57,938
<i>And the moment she put her
hand around loner's throat.</i>

536
00:42:57,939 --> 00:42:59,239
<i>He would said:</i>

537
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:01,848
<i>"I hope him die right the way".</i>

538
00:43:50,562 --> 00:43:51,862
What happened?

539
00:43:51,863 --> 00:43:55,034
She jumped from the window of room 180.

540
00:43:56,129 --> 00:43:59,652
There are bloods and biscuits everywhere
I hope she die right the way.

541
00:44:00,935 --> 00:44:05,499
On second thought, I hope she
suffers quite a bit before she dies

542
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:07,397
I just hope her pathetic scream...

543
00:44:07,398 --> 00:44:09,053
can't be heard from my room.

544
00:44:09,054 --> 00:44:12,827
Because I was thinking about having a
lie down and I need peace and quiet

545
00:44:13,681 --> 00:44:15,709
I was playing golf and I'm quite tired.

546
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:19,179
The last thing I need is some
woman dying slowly and loudly

547
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:21,121
I can't hear you with all this screaming.

548
00:44:21,122 --> 00:44:23,972
We'll talk some other
time when it's quieter.

549
00:44:26,782 --> 00:44:28,082
Good bye.

550
00:44:32,088 --> 00:44:33,388
Good bye.

551
00:44:41,232 --> 00:44:42,592
One message.

552
00:44:43,161 --> 00:44:44,461
Hello.

553
00:44:44,462 --> 00:44:48,093
You're probably in the bathroom,
that's why you can't hear phone ring.

554
00:44:48,094 --> 00:44:50,793
Nothing like a cold shower in the morning.

555
00:44:51,463 --> 00:44:56,923
Well, I'll call you a little bit
later after you finish your shower.

556
00:44:57,631 --> 00:44:59,174
We'll talk later.

557
00:44:59,811 --> 00:45:01,111
Bye.

558
00:45:04,498 --> 00:45:05,849
Do you mind if I join in.

559
00:45:14,904 --> 00:45:16,204
You like Martini

560
00:46:13,619 --> 00:46:16,794
I think we're a match
Yes, I think so too.

561
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:22,262
The keys to the double room, please

562
00:46:30,489 --> 00:46:33,810
I wish you the best of the luck, we
all wish you the best of the luck.

563
00:46:49,078 --> 00:46:52,315
Do you normally sleep on the left
side of the bed or the right?

564
00:46:52,316 --> 00:46:56,761
The right, you?
The left, perfect.

565
00:46:58,183 --> 00:47:01,027
Should I shut off the light
or would you like to read?

566
00:47:01,028 --> 00:47:04,459
I like to read, does light bother you?
No

567
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:06,893
I'm not bothered by light or noise

568
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,087
I'm deep sleeper.

569
00:47:25,805 --> 00:47:27,937
Hello
Hello.

570
00:47:28,379 --> 00:47:30,592
Congratulation
Thank you.

571
00:47:30,593 --> 00:47:33,231
This is our new daughter,
her name is Elizabeth

572
00:47:33,232 --> 00:47:36,212
Elizabeth, give this nice man a
kiss, he is a friend of mine.

573
00:47:37,171 --> 00:47:40,397
The last thing I want right now
is a kiss from silly little girl.

574
00:47:44,864 --> 00:47:46,787
Come on, you know.

575
00:47:46,788 --> 00:47:48,527
Don't cry, you should thank me, Elizabeth.

576
00:47:48,528 --> 00:47:50,602
Now you have a limp and would
be more like your father.

577
00:48:16,187 --> 00:48:17,487
Good morning.

578
00:48:22,511 --> 00:48:23,811
Good morning

579
00:48:25,282 --> 00:48:26,641
I killed your bother

580
00:48:27,611 --> 00:48:29,881
I left him to die very slowly.

581
00:48:29,882 --> 00:48:32,345
He may not be dead yet as now we speak

582
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:35,107
I was kicking him for ages.

583
00:48:36,013 --> 00:48:37,455
Doesn't matter.

584
00:48:38,691 --> 00:48:43,282
He whined a little the strangest
kind of bark, something like this.

585
00:48:50,472 --> 00:48:52,441
Must have been from pain.

586
00:48:52,442 --> 00:48:54,971
You didn't hear anything?
No.

587
00:48:54,972 --> 00:48:57,438
You really are deep sleeper.

588
00:48:57,439 --> 00:49:01,004
Would you like some coffee?
I love some.

589
00:49:02,178 --> 00:49:05,166
As soon as I wash my
face and brush my teeth

590
00:49:08,852 --> 00:49:12,692
I can't wait to hear that story you
promise to tell me last night...

591
00:49:12,693 --> 00:49:17,624
about that student of yours in the
university, and his awful final project.

592
00:49:35,888 --> 00:49:38,535
It's really very funny story.

593
00:49:39,113 --> 00:49:40,947
His name is Ryess.

594
00:49:40,948 --> 00:49:44,771
R-y-e-s-s, Ryess.

595
00:49:50,321 --> 00:49:52,982
It is not tear, just water,
I just washed my face

596
00:49:54,546 --> 00:49:55,969
I knew you were lying

597
00:49:55,970 --> 00:49:57,575
I can't understand why you did it.

598
00:49:57,576 --> 00:49:58,876
When you know as anyone...

599
00:49:58,877 --> 00:50:01,575
that relationship can
not be built on the lie.

600
00:50:01,576 --> 00:50:05,999
We're going to the hotel manager right now,
and you'll get the punishment you deserve.

601
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,764
What's the punishment for this.

602
00:50:07,765 --> 00:50:10,494
They turn you into animal
no one wants to be

603
00:51:54,443 --> 00:51:56,796
I saw you patner went back that way.

604
00:51:56,797 --> 00:51:58,145
He looked frantic.

605
00:51:58,146 --> 00:51:59,983
Is everything ok?

606
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:28,981
<i>At first he wanted to kill her in
some horrible and painful way...</i>

607
00:52:28,982 --> 00:52:31,945
<i>like the death she
inflicted on his brother.</i>

608
00:52:34,153 --> 00:52:38,225
<i>He thought about kicking her in
the stomach over and over again.</i>

609
00:52:38,226 --> 00:52:42,055
<i>And then stabbing her in the
same spot in the stomach.</i>

610
00:52:47,771 --> 00:52:52,427
<i>Then he thought there wouldn't be much
point because she's already unconscious...</i>

611
00:52:52,428 --> 00:52:55,983
<i>and wouldn't feel any pain
from the kick or the knife.</i>

612
00:52:58,053 --> 00:53:01,349
You have to shoot me, so they
don't suspect I helped you.

613
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:03,280
<i>A hotel maid helped him.</i>

614
00:53:03,281 --> 00:53:05,970
<i>He couldn't understand why she did it.</i>

615
00:53:20,077 --> 00:53:23,190
<i>So he decided to turn her into a animal.</i>

616
00:53:24,092 --> 00:53:27,885
<i>He dragged her to the room
with transformation took place.</i>

617
00:53:28,992 --> 00:53:32,569
<i>I asked him many times what sorts
of animal he turn her into.</i>

618
00:53:32,570 --> 00:53:35,371
<i>But he always give me the same answer.</i>

619
00:53:35,372 --> 00:53:37,287
<i>"That's none of your concern".</i>

620
00:53:45,743 --> 00:53:47,831
<i>That night he left the hotel...</i>

621
00:53:47,832 --> 00:53:49,941
<i>once and for all.</i>

622
00:53:52,890 --> 00:53:56,237
<i>He began to run without
knowing where he was heading.</i>

623
00:53:56,523 --> 00:53:58,993
<i>But he was heading to us.</i>

624
00:54:25,702 --> 00:54:28,275
<i>This was the start of his new life.</i>

625
00:54:29,123 --> 00:54:32,859
<i>Back then, he didn't know how
much it hurts to be alone.</i>

626
00:54:35,923 --> 00:54:39,974
<i>How much it hurts when you can not reach
to rub pain relieve ointment on your back.</i>

627
00:54:39,975 --> 00:54:42,650
<i>And you're constantly in pain.</i>

628
00:55:28,288 --> 00:55:32,011
Find him in the woods,
he escaped from hotel.

629
00:55:32,012 --> 00:55:34,757
Are you a doctor by any chance?

630
00:55:34,758 --> 00:55:36,058
No.

631
00:55:36,059 --> 00:55:37,768
That's a pity.

632
00:55:37,769 --> 00:55:40,221
We need a doctor around.

633
00:55:40,222 --> 00:55:42,910
We had one, but they caught
him a couple of months ago

634
00:55:43,378 --> 00:55:44,805
I'm a achitect.

635
00:55:45,907 --> 00:55:48,896
That's ok, so welcome.

636
00:55:49,397 --> 00:55:52,118
You can stay with us for
as long as you like.

637
00:55:52,119 --> 00:55:55,432
You can be a loner until the day
you die, there is no time limit.

638
00:55:55,593 --> 00:55:56,893
Thank you very much.

639
00:56:11,676 --> 00:56:14,512
Anyway, any romantic or sexual relations...

640
00:56:14,513 --> 00:56:17,098
between loners are not permitted.

641
00:56:17,099 --> 00:56:20,144
And any such acts are
punished, is that clear?

642
00:56:22,782 --> 00:56:24,862
Can I have a converstation with someone?

643
00:56:24,877 --> 00:56:30,168
Of course you can, so long as there
is no flirting or anything like that.

644
00:56:30,169 --> 00:56:33,221
That apply to dance nights as well.

645
00:56:33,222 --> 00:56:35,166
We all dance by ourselves.

646
00:56:35,167 --> 00:56:37,921
That's why we only play electronic music.

647
00:56:48,989 --> 00:56:50,648
What happened to you mouth.

648
00:56:52,413 --> 00:56:55,034
He can't speak, he's getting the red kiss.

649
00:56:56,389 --> 00:56:57,689
What's the red kiss?

650
00:56:57,690 --> 00:56:59,709
We slash his lips with razor

651
00:57:00,175 --> 00:57:03,397
and lips of another loner, then
force them to kiss each other.

652
00:57:03,695 --> 00:57:05,855
That was couple of days ago now.

653
00:57:06,259 --> 00:57:08,838
But the cuts are deep,
so they're still in pain.

654
00:57:08,839 --> 00:57:10,488
They were flirting, you know.

655
00:57:20,550 --> 00:57:23,449
<i>Some punishments are worse
than other punishments.</i>

656
00:57:25,758 --> 00:57:29,209
<i>Having your thumb cut is worse
than having you head shaved.</i>

657
00:57:29,643 --> 00:57:32,523
<i>And having a hot boiled
egg under you arm pit...</i>

658
00:57:32,524 --> 00:57:34,859
<i>is worse than having you leg kicked.</i>

659
00:57:35,947 --> 00:57:39,300
<i>The punishment I'm afraid of isn't
the red kiss but another one.</i>

660
00:57:39,301 --> 00:57:42,568
<i>It is called the red intercourse.</i>

661
00:57:43,213 --> 00:57:45,928
<i>I have never seen it happened.</i>

662
00:57:45,929 --> 00:57:47,889
<i>But it's not difficult to
imagine what it is means.</i>

663
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:51,660
<i>Oh my God, I'm so afraid of it.</i>

664
00:58:00,996 --> 00:58:02,296
Move.

665
00:58:04,178 --> 00:58:05,478
Hide.

666
00:58:08,463 --> 00:58:09,763
Move.

667
00:58:11,657 --> 00:58:12,957
Hide.

668
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:21,211
<i>That was the first time I saw him.</i>

669
00:58:21,212 --> 00:58:24,503
<i>He was hiding behind a tree close to mine.</i>

670
00:58:24,827 --> 00:58:27,322
<i>He seems quite presentable.</i>

671
00:58:27,704 --> 00:58:30,094
<i>The next day, in the city.</i>

672
00:58:30,095 --> 00:58:33,105
<i>He found out that I was shortsighted too.</i>

673
00:58:39,174 --> 00:58:42,205
<i>That night in my sleep, I dreamed...</i>

674
00:58:42,206 --> 00:58:44,522
<i>we lived in a big house
together in the city...</i>

675
00:58:44,523 --> 00:58:46,664
<i>with large and well lit kitchen.</i>

676
00:58:46,665 --> 00:58:48,942
<i>And I was wearing dark blue trousers...</i>

677
00:58:48,943 --> 00:58:50,865
<i>and tight green blouse.</i>

678
00:58:50,866 --> 00:58:54,205
<i>And he took my clothes off
and fuck me up the ass.</i>

679
00:59:00,814 --> 00:59:04,275
<i>And as he was fucking me, a
thug came into the kitchen...</i>

680
00:59:04,276 --> 00:59:07,020
<i>and took the steak knife
from the second drawer...</i>

681
00:59:07,021 --> 00:59:10,074
<i>and attacked us, stabbing
the knife into our belly...</i>

682
00:59:10,075 --> 00:59:11,945
<i>one by one.</i>

683
00:59:11,946 --> 00:59:13,848
<i>I woke up terrified.</i>

684
00:59:24,592 --> 00:59:25,931
Try harder.

685
00:59:27,209 --> 00:59:29,820
Don't give up, you know you
should've been more careful.

686
00:59:31,016 --> 00:59:32,929
Try harder, or they'll find you...

687
00:59:32,930 --> 00:59:35,682
and you would be turning
into a animal, a weak one.

688
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:39,456
We must get to move on now.

689
00:59:39,457 --> 00:59:41,368
It's really too dangerous to stay here.

690
00:59:41,369 --> 00:59:44,762
If you manage to free yourself, run
as fast as you can, and come find us.

691
00:59:44,763 --> 00:59:47,774
If you manage to free yourself, but
think you'll die from bleeding.

692
00:59:47,775 --> 00:59:49,377
Go straight to your grave.

693
00:59:50,112 --> 00:59:51,921
Have you dug your own grave?

694
00:59:51,922 --> 00:59:54,331
¡ªYes
¡ªVery good.

695
00:59:55,116 --> 00:59:56,833
That's enough for now

696
01:00:05,311 --> 01:00:07,592
I'm going to go hunting for truffles.

697
01:00:07,593 --> 01:00:09,670
They are delicious and quite rare.

698
01:00:09,671 --> 01:00:11,403
A kilo can fetch a lot of money.

699
01:00:11,404 --> 01:00:12,704
You're going to need a pig

700
01:00:12,705 --> 01:00:14,405
they are impossible to find out otherwise

701
01:00:14,406 --> 01:00:15,706
I know
Don't be long.

702
01:00:15,707 --> 01:00:17,752
Gonna get them back in 50 minutes.

703
01:00:44,563 --> 01:00:47,301
Hello David
Hello Robert.

704
01:00:50,354 --> 01:00:53,611
What you did to that woman is dreadful
She killed my brother

705
01:00:54,056 --> 01:00:56,806
I would've done the same
thing if she killed you.

706
01:00:56,807 --> 01:00:58,243
You, you're like a brother to me.

707
01:00:58,244 --> 01:00:59,979
Oh you're my best friend of the whole world

708
01:01:00,704 --> 01:01:03,064
I don't think I'm your best
friend of the whole world.

709
01:01:03,512 --> 01:01:05,897
You used to spend much time with John.

710
01:01:05,898 --> 01:01:07,198
Oh, who's John?

711
01:01:08,031 --> 01:01:10,096
John, the limping man
Oh yeah

712
01:01:10,097 --> 01:01:13,600
I didn't even remember
his name, or his face.

713
01:01:13,601 --> 01:01:16,749
You're the one I think of
whenever I need a friend.

714
01:01:18,010 --> 01:01:20,642
Nevertheless, did John make it?

715
01:01:22,359 --> 01:01:24,489
They're getting ready for the yacht.

716
01:01:24,653 --> 01:01:26,442
All begin this week.

717
01:01:26,849 --> 01:01:29,397
Everyone said they're going to
make it as perfect suited...

718
01:01:29,398 --> 01:01:32,182
and a child could help them
pass the fighting and arguing.

719
01:01:32,183 --> 01:01:34,976
That's great
You're not thinking coming back?

720
01:01:35,681 --> 01:01:37,843
You know if you told the hotel
manager about your brother.

721
01:01:37,844 --> 01:01:39,539
She probably forgive you.

722
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:42,123
No, it's really nice to be on your own.

723
01:01:42,124 --> 01:01:43,867
There is no one tying you down.

724
01:01:43,868 --> 01:01:47,797
You listen to music whenever you like,
You masturbate whenever you want.

725
01:01:47,798 --> 01:01:51,815
Go for a walk whenever you like,
have a chat whenever you like

726
01:01:51,816 --> 01:01:53,845
I don't miss companionship at all

727
01:01:54,315 --> 01:01:57,115
I just miss you, because
you're my one true friend.

728
01:01:59,568 --> 01:02:01,200
Are you gonna shoot me?

729
01:02:01,201 --> 01:02:04,555
I'm afraid so, I only have two days left.

730
01:02:04,556 --> 01:02:05,856
What did you said?

731
01:02:05,857 --> 01:02:08,259
I can't understand what you speak

732
01:02:08,260 --> 01:02:10,626
I'm gonna shoot you, I
only have two days left...

733
01:02:10,627 --> 01:02:12,059
and I need more time.

734
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:14,123
Do you actually believe another
day would make a difference?

735
01:02:14,124 --> 01:02:15,565
Have you seen how ugly you are.

736
01:02:15,907 --> 01:02:17,291
You haven't got a chance.

737
01:02:17,292 --> 01:02:18,592
If I was a woman...

738
01:02:24,113 --> 01:02:26,170
Don't tell anyone I helped you.

739
01:02:26,171 --> 01:02:29,248
If you want to repay me, there is a way.

740
01:02:29,249 --> 01:02:30,815
If you kill a rabbit,
bring it to me to eat.

741
01:02:32,223 --> 01:02:34,420
You promise?
Yes.

742
01:02:34,421 --> 01:02:36,259
Bye
Bye.

743
01:03:18,661 --> 01:03:20,387
- Hello.
- Hello.

744
01:03:24,339 --> 01:03:25,980
You brought what I asked for?

745
01:03:25,981 --> 01:03:27,281
Of course.

746
01:03:32,169 --> 01:03:34,919
The gun is in the pocket
with the electronic keys...

747
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:36,220
with the numbers of the double rooms.

748
01:03:37,657 --> 01:03:39,359
Try not to lose the keys

749
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:41,067
I need to return them

750
01:03:42,155 --> 01:03:43,632
I propose we act on Saturday...

751
01:03:43,633 --> 01:03:45,877
after the ball Everyone is tired...

752
01:03:45,878 --> 01:03:48,917
and most employees are
gone on the week-end.

753
01:03:49,691 --> 01:03:50,991
And the shampoo?

754
01:03:51,994 --> 01:03:53,294
I forgot

755
01:03:53,868 --> 01:03:56,220
I'll bring two bottles next time.

756
01:03:56,221 --> 01:03:58,176
Do you know how fantastic you are?

757
01:03:58,961 --> 01:04:01,751
Please make a note for the
shampoo so you don't forget

758
01:04:05,061 --> 01:04:06,739
I need to tell you something.

759
01:04:07,003 --> 01:04:08,303
What?

760
01:04:09,104 --> 01:04:10,874
This is my last mission

761
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:12,924
I can't do it anymore

762
01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:15,946
I can't stand living in
that horrible mansion...

763
01:04:15,947 --> 01:04:17,367
with that fat dentist.

764
01:04:17,872 --> 01:04:20,878
He keeps asking if I've flossed.

765
01:04:20,879 --> 01:04:22,447
He makes me clean my teeth after every meal

766
01:04:22,448 --> 01:04:24,225
no matter how small it is.

767
01:04:24,689 --> 01:04:26,466
After we're finished setting
up for the big night

768
01:04:26,467 --> 01:04:27,767
you can come and live with us

769
01:04:27,768 --> 01:04:29,978
I'll find another mole

770
01:04:30,810 --> 01:04:33,859
I don't think I'll ever find
someone as efficient as you

771
01:04:33,860 --> 01:04:36,545
but I need to respect your wishes.

772
01:04:37,209 --> 01:04:38,907
Be patient just a few more days...

773
01:04:38,908 --> 01:04:41,538
and don't forget to take
your birth control pill. Ok?

774
01:04:41,927 --> 01:04:43,227
Thank you.

775
01:04:43,228 --> 01:04:45,141
No, thank you.

776
01:04:45,580 --> 01:04:47,089
You were fantastic.

777
01:05:14,690 --> 01:05:16,861
<i>He carefully flayed the
rabbit with sharp knife...</i>

778
01:05:16,862 --> 01:05:19,097
<i>and cut off his head.</i>

779
01:05:22,018 --> 01:05:24,531
<i>He then sliced open its belly...</i>

780
01:05:24,532 --> 01:05:27,631
<i>and stuffed with well washed
red and green peppers...</i>

781
01:05:27,632 --> 01:05:31,613
<i>not too spicy, and a
little garlic and mint.</i>

782
01:05:35,733 --> 01:05:40,283
<i>He then soak it to lemon juice and
leave it a while to marinate the flesh.</i>

783
01:05:40,715 --> 01:05:45,987
<i>Before you skewer it on a stick and
roast over the fire for about an hour.</i>

784
01:05:48,151 --> 01:05:50,440
<i>That's my favourite food.</i>

785
01:05:50,858 --> 01:05:52,407
<i>Rabbit.</i>

786
01:08:18,823 --> 01:08:22,449
Woman, brunette, 50 years old.

787
01:08:22,801 --> 01:08:25,441
Marriage certificate
expired two months ago.

788
01:08:25,442 --> 01:08:29,491
My husband went on a bussiness trip
Ok, may I have a look?

789
01:08:37,331 --> 01:08:38,631
Hands.

790
01:08:47,617 --> 01:08:50,500
No dirt under her nails
or mud under her shoes

791
01:08:50,501 --> 01:08:52,708
9, Belsize road.

792
01:08:52,709 --> 01:08:55,189
So your husband does away
Yes.

793
01:08:55,190 --> 01:08:56,723
Where?
Bath.

794
01:08:56,724 --> 01:08:58,024
Good morning, sir.

795
01:08:58,025 --> 01:08:59,601
Are you here alone?

796
01:09:00,369 --> 01:09:01,669
Good morning, officer.

797
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:03,921
No, I'm here with my partner.

798
01:09:03,922 --> 01:09:07,430
She's inside one of the
stores shopping right now.

799
01:09:07,431 --> 01:09:09,503
Can I see you certificate please?

800
01:09:11,053 --> 01:09:13,241
My partner keep it in her purse.

801
01:09:13,574 --> 01:09:17,073
You see, I'm losing it all the time

802
01:09:17,074 --> 01:09:21,408
I see, and what store is she shopping in?

803
01:09:28,096 --> 01:09:30,587
Oh, here she is

804
01:09:31,443 --> 01:09:32,810
I'm sorry, darling.

805
01:09:32,811 --> 01:09:36,306
They have such huge variety
pain relieve ointment

806
01:09:36,307 --> 01:09:39,372
I bought you this one, I hope
it's the one you're looking for.

807
01:09:39,373 --> 01:09:43,937
That's wonderful, dear, can
I have my certificate?

808
01:09:44,716 --> 01:09:48,672
Of course, darling, would you
like to see mine, officer?

809
01:09:48,673 --> 01:09:50,693
No, that's ok.

810
01:09:51,289 --> 01:09:52,794
Thank you, sir.

811
01:09:52,795 --> 01:09:54,095
You have a good day.

812
01:09:54,096 --> 01:09:57,083
Thank you, officer, you have a good day
Madam.

813
01:09:57,415 --> 01:09:58,715
Sir.

814
01:10:03,012 --> 01:10:05,133
If I'm walking too slowly, just say it.

815
01:10:05,134 --> 01:10:06,961
And I'll pick up my pace.

816
01:10:06,962 --> 01:10:09,035
This pace is fine.

817
01:10:09,567 --> 01:10:13,783
Maybe you don't squeeze my hand so tightly,
my palms are getting a little sweety.

818
01:10:13,784 --> 01:10:17,541
Better?
Yes, much better.

819
01:10:18,361 --> 01:10:22,086
Are you planning on buying anything else
nice for yourself while we're here?

820
01:10:22,087 --> 01:10:24,760
Yes, contact len solution...

821
01:10:24,761 --> 01:10:26,684
and Packer rollerball

822
01:10:28,058 --> 01:10:30,398
I didn't know you're short-sighted

823
01:10:31,686 --> 01:10:33,847
I'm short-sighted too.

824
01:10:59,696 --> 01:11:01,604
Will you stay a few days?

825
01:11:02,451 --> 01:11:04,041
I'm afraid not, papa.

826
01:11:04,435 --> 01:11:06,432
We're heading back again today

827
01:11:06,433 --> 01:11:08,997
tomorrow I'm going away
on a bussiness trip.

828
01:11:08,998 --> 01:11:11,587
You know how demanding my job is.

829
01:11:11,588 --> 01:11:15,069
Don't ask if I can stay a
few days everytime I come.

830
01:11:15,886 --> 01:11:18,996
Do you all work for the same company?

831
01:11:20,215 --> 01:11:22,426
Yes
Yes.

832
01:11:22,427 --> 01:11:26,318
My daughter said to me
it's a very fine company.

833
01:11:26,319 --> 01:11:27,995
Do you agree?

834
01:11:28,465 --> 01:11:31,220
It's a rather good company
Yes it is.

835
01:11:31,684 --> 01:11:33,641
One of the best, I would say.

836
01:11:34,725 --> 01:11:38,177
The only problem with job is
that I don't have much time...

837
01:11:38,178 --> 01:11:40,631
for my wife and kids.

838
01:11:44,167 --> 01:11:47,113
We have four beautiful children.

839
01:11:47,468 --> 01:11:49,202
Congratulation.

840
01:11:49,203 --> 01:11:51,206
Thank you
Thank you.

841
01:11:54,842 --> 01:11:57,972
But even if we don't have children

842
01:11:57,973 --> 01:12:00,656
I would never dream of leaving my wife.

843
01:12:00,657 --> 01:12:06,143
Even if it just two of us,
on our own, we go on trips.

844
01:12:06,144 --> 01:12:11,742
We go to Portofino in Italy, and
go to Greek island for the summer.

845
01:12:11,743 --> 01:12:16,792
So our relationship would be as
intense as it was at the start

846
01:12:19,212 --> 01:12:23,395
I love my wife so much...

847
01:12:23,396 --> 01:12:25,619
I could die for her.

848
01:12:28,271 --> 01:12:30,571
That's how much I love her.

849
01:12:42,033 --> 01:12:44,532
We first day in the city did great.

850
01:12:44,533 --> 01:12:50,176
That part about holiday destination in
the Mediterranean was really brilliant.

851
01:12:50,177 --> 01:12:51,676
Thank you very much.

852
01:13:02,406 --> 01:13:04,394
When did you become short-sighted?

853
01:13:05,809 --> 01:13:07,424
When I was 16.

854
01:13:08,114 --> 01:13:10,647
You?
When I was 12.

855
01:13:11,735 --> 01:13:14,476
What was maker of your
first pair of glasses?

856
01:13:15,977 --> 01:13:17,483
I don't remember.

857
01:13:19,012 --> 01:13:21,670
Do you have astigmatism too?
Yes.

858
01:13:29,368 --> 01:13:31,321
Would you like me to rub some balm...

859
01:13:31,322 --> 01:13:32,622
on your back?

860
01:13:33,797 --> 01:13:36,495
On the bits you can't reach on you own?

861
01:13:38,405 --> 01:13:39,906
I like that.

862
01:13:56,114 --> 01:13:58,912
Here?
A little lower please.

863
01:13:58,913 --> 01:14:00,787
Here?
Yes.

864
01:14:30,507 --> 01:14:32,699
Hello everyone, and good luck.

865
01:14:32,700 --> 01:14:35,099
The room numbers are as follows.

866
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:38,632
Room 306, the hotel
manager and her partner.

867
01:14:38,633 --> 01:14:41,432
They both have nice voices.

868
01:14:41,433 --> 01:14:44,726
Room 240, couple who both love to ski.

869
01:14:44,727 --> 01:14:49,716
Room 282, couple who both
studied social science.

870
01:14:49,717 --> 01:14:53,248
Name of the yacht Bliss,
couple prone to nose bleed.

871
01:15:05,050 --> 01:15:06,946
You and you take 306.

872
01:15:06,947 --> 01:15:08,895
You and you take 240.

873
01:15:08,896 --> 01:15:10,644
You take 282.

874
01:15:10,645 --> 01:15:13,509
And you two, take the yacht.

875
01:15:13,510 --> 01:15:15,275
Can I go to the yacht?

876
01:15:15,276 --> 01:15:17,719
Ok then, you take the yacht.

877
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:20,085
And you take 282.

878
01:15:20,086 --> 01:15:24,055
And us three will take the manager room.

879
01:15:24,056 --> 01:15:25,549
We have 40 minutes.

880
01:16:15,593 --> 01:16:16,893
Wake up.

881
01:16:17,847 --> 01:16:19,147
Get up.

882
01:16:21,279 --> 01:16:22,918
Sit down and sit over there.

883
01:16:24,435 --> 01:16:25,853
Put your hands behind your back.

884
01:16:27,701 --> 01:16:31,626
A basketball weights
between 550 and 650 grams.

885
01:16:31,627 --> 01:16:34,093
Did you know that?
No, I didn't know that.

886
01:16:35,281 --> 01:16:36,581
Yes.

887
01:16:38,059 --> 01:16:40,380
The weight is different for
men's and women's game.

888
01:16:40,381 --> 01:16:41,826
That's roughly how much it weights.

889
01:16:42,795 --> 01:16:47,302
Do you know how much volleyball weights?
No, but I like to find out.

890
01:16:48,887 --> 01:16:50,535
Good evening
Good evening

891
01:16:50,536 --> 01:16:52,535
I have something to tell you.

892
01:16:53,010 --> 01:16:55,613
His nose doesn't really bleed on its own.

893
01:16:55,614 --> 01:16:59,781
He bangs it against the wall or piece
of hard wood, or something like that.

894
01:16:59,782 --> 01:17:02,427
Or he cut it with pen knife
when you're not looking.

895
01:17:02,428 --> 01:17:04,253
You two are not suited.

896
01:17:04,849 --> 01:17:06,149
Shut up.

897
01:17:06,150 --> 01:17:08,273
Dad, tell him to leave, I'm sleepy.

898
01:17:08,274 --> 01:17:11,675
And I'm quite sure that stain
on his T-shirt isn't blood...

899
01:17:11,676 --> 01:17:14,930
but cherry juice or tomato ketchup,
or red water color paint...

900
01:17:14,931 --> 01:17:18,573
or something like that, or beetroot juice.

901
01:17:20,901 --> 01:17:22,256
Do you love her?

902
01:17:24,021 --> 01:17:25,774
With all my heart.

903
01:17:26,839 --> 01:17:30,690
How much do you love her?
On the scale of 1 to 15

904
01:17:34,668 --> 01:17:35,968
14

905
01:17:37,394 --> 01:17:39,835
14 is a very impressive score.

906
01:17:39,836 --> 01:17:42,045
He love her very much indeed.

907
01:17:42,828 --> 01:17:44,754
Who do you think we should kill?

908
01:17:44,755 --> 01:17:47,285
Who will be able to live
on their own better.

909
01:17:54,667 --> 01:17:57,083
Here is the knife, mom, kill him.

910
01:17:58,535 --> 01:18:00,219
You better get out before you can.

911
01:18:00,613 --> 01:18:01,913
Ok.

912
01:18:03,411 --> 01:18:05,265
That's all I came to said anyway.

913
01:18:16,163 --> 01:18:17,463
You?

914
01:18:17,821 --> 01:18:21,654
If this woman die, do you
think you manage on you own?

915
01:18:21,655 --> 01:18:23,718
Or will you get involve with someone else?

916
01:18:23,719 --> 01:18:27,132
No, I can live alone, she can't

917
01:18:27,848 --> 01:18:30,802
I'm on my own for hours
when she got out the hotel

918
01:18:31,886 --> 01:18:34,354
I like sitting in the room...

919
01:18:35,072 --> 01:18:38,099
relaxes me, calms me

920
01:18:38,773 --> 01:18:40,690
I like it a lot

921
01:18:42,754 --> 01:18:46,570
I can definitely live on my own.

922
01:18:46,571 --> 01:18:48,213
No!
Be quiet.

923
01:18:56,403 --> 01:18:57,703
Take it.

924
01:19:00,629 --> 01:19:02,027
Shoot her.

925
01:19:14,634 --> 01:19:15,934
No.

926
01:19:16,878 --> 01:19:20,228
No, no, no.

927
01:20:05,666 --> 01:20:07,151
Where were you?

928
01:20:07,152 --> 01:20:09,202
I was looking for you

929
01:20:09,203 --> 01:20:12,723
I was masturbating behind
those trees over there.

930
01:20:14,949 --> 01:20:16,587
Why aren't you dancing?

931
01:20:16,846 --> 01:20:19,133
My legs are little sore.

932
01:20:19,942 --> 01:20:21,755
Did you dig your grave.

933
01:20:21,877 --> 01:20:23,444
Not yet

934
01:20:23,904 --> 01:20:28,394
I don't mean to pressure you, or to
ruin the mood, now we're celebrating.

935
01:20:28,395 --> 01:20:30,548
But at some point you have to do it.

936
01:20:30,549 --> 01:20:34,970
Don't expect anyone else to dig your
grave for you or to carry your corpse.

937
01:20:35,130 --> 01:20:38,399
Or throw some dirts over
you, that's about it

938
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:44,278
tomorrow find a spot you like, well the
ground isn't too rocky to make a start.

939
01:20:45,719 --> 01:20:48,540
Enjoying the rest evening
Thank you.

940
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:05,885
As soon as his last patient left, I
entered his office and I said to him:

941
01:21:05,886 --> 01:21:08,273
"Honey, the dinner is ready..."

942
01:21:08,274 --> 01:21:10,737
however, I'm not sure I
can eat right now...

943
01:21:10,738 --> 01:21:12,595
one of my front teeth hurts a lot...

944
01:21:12,596 --> 01:21:14,353
"can you take a look, please dear?"

945
01:21:15,131 --> 01:21:16,964
"Yes, sure, no problem", he said.

946
01:21:16,965 --> 01:21:18,403
And the minute he turn his head

947
01:21:18,404 --> 01:21:21,631
I took the drill and I shoved to his chest.

948
01:21:24,490 --> 01:21:26,439
That story sounds really interesting...

949
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:27,740
but I have to leave

950
01:21:27,741 --> 01:21:30,674
I just remember I left some batteries
next to tree down there...

951
01:21:30,675 --> 01:21:32,464
and the last thing I want is to lose them.

952
01:21:32,465 --> 01:21:33,765
Sorry.

953
01:21:42,998 --> 01:21:47,428
Did you catch rabbits?
No, someone brought them.

954
01:21:47,429 --> 01:21:49,285
Who?
Friend of mine.

955
01:21:49,286 --> 01:21:51,691
Do you want one?
No.

956
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:56,170
You don't need to accept
rabbits from other people.

957
01:21:56,171 --> 01:21:59,449
If you need more rabbits,
just ask, and I'll bring more.

958
01:22:01,699 --> 01:22:04,475
Catching rabbit is difficult,
but I try to do better.

959
01:22:04,476 --> 01:22:06,495
There is no need for you to
be in debt to the others.

960
01:22:06,923 --> 01:22:08,466
Thank you very much.

961
01:22:09,963 --> 01:22:13,971
The man who brought you
rabbits, is he short-sighted?

962
01:22:13,972 --> 01:22:17,273
I don't know, I don't think so.

963
01:22:17,274 --> 01:22:18,705
Ok.

964
01:22:30,156 --> 01:22:32,268
Is that a sparrow up that tree?

965
01:22:33,985 --> 01:22:37,194
Can't really see that
far, I don't think so.

966
01:22:37,195 --> 01:22:39,614
Are you short-sighted?
No.

967
01:22:39,615 --> 01:22:42,168
You're lying
it's truth.

968
01:22:47,763 --> 01:22:49,876
What does it say here?

969
01:22:50,452 --> 01:22:51,883
YKK

970
01:22:52,173 --> 01:22:53,775
You knew that already.

971
01:22:53,776 --> 01:22:55,584
All zips say the same thing

972
01:22:55,585 --> 01:22:57,019
I'm not short-sighted

973
01:22:57,020 --> 01:22:59,405
I don't understand why
you won't believe me?

974
01:22:59,406 --> 01:23:02,459
I can see you really clearly,
I used to be a pilot.

975
01:23:02,460 --> 01:23:04,125
You wear contact lenses

976
01:23:04,126 --> 01:23:07,716
I don't wear contact lenses,
I'm not short-sighted, I swear.

977
01:23:07,717 --> 01:23:10,578
You're, you think I'm a
idiot and can't tell.

978
01:23:12,622 --> 01:23:13,930
Let me see

979
01:23:17,127 --> 01:23:18,581
I want to see your eyes.

980
01:23:20,098 --> 01:23:21,398
Look up.

981
01:23:21,909 --> 01:23:23,209
Look up.

982
01:23:25,153 --> 01:23:26,735
Up, up,

983
01:23:27,111 --> 01:23:28,701
Look down now.

984
01:23:30,211 --> 01:23:31,663
Look left.

985
01:23:33,451 --> 01:23:34,780
Look right.

986
01:23:35,672 --> 01:23:36,972
Up again

987
01:23:44,465 --> 01:23:45,765
I'm sorry

988
01:23:47,127 --> 01:23:49,398
I thought you try to fool me

989
01:23:50,841 --> 01:23:52,141
I'm sorry.

990
01:23:55,977 --> 01:24:00,235
For this synchronization exercise,
we have to fully concentrate...

991
01:24:00,236 --> 01:24:03,659
as we both have to press play
at the exactly the same time.

992
01:24:04,091 --> 01:24:06,226
Why don't we just use one headset?

993
01:24:07,175 --> 01:24:09,050
Because that's the whole point.

994
01:24:09,051 --> 01:24:11,011
This is the exercise for us.

995
01:24:11,610 --> 01:24:14,049
We have to be totally synchronize.

996
01:24:14,263 --> 01:24:15,563
Ok

997
01:24:21,785 --> 01:24:23,718
I'm ready
Ok

998
01:24:26,347 --> 01:24:27,647
5...

999
01:24:27,648 --> 01:24:28,948
4...

1000
01:24:28,949 --> 01:24:30,249
3...

1001
01:24:30,250 --> 01:24:31,550
2...

1002
01:25:28,231 --> 01:25:31,410
<i>We developed a code that we can
communicate with each other...</i>

1003
01:25:31,411 --> 01:25:35,414
<i>even in front of the others without
them knowing what we're saying.</i>

1004
01:25:35,415 --> 01:25:39,144
<i>When we turn our heads
to the left, it means...</i>

1005
01:25:39,145 --> 01:25:41,763
<i>"I love you more than
anything in the world".</i>

1006
01:25:41,764 --> 01:25:44,573
<i>When we turn our heads to
the right, it means...</i>

1007
01:25:44,574 --> 01:25:46,720
<i>"Watch out, we're in danger".</i>

1008
01:25:48,719 --> 01:25:51,993
<i>We have to be very careful in
the beginning not to mix up.</i>

1009
01:25:51,994 --> 01:25:54,058
<i>"I love you more than
anything in the world"...</i>

1010
01:25:54,059 --> 01:25:56,893
<i>with "watch out, we're in danger".</i>

1011
01:25:58,342 --> 01:26:00,921
<i>When we raise out left arm, it means...</i>

1012
01:26:00,922 --> 01:26:03,465
<i>"I want to dance in you arm".</i>

1013
01:26:03,466 --> 01:26:06,081
<i>When we make a fist and
put it behind our back.</i>

1014
01:26:06,082 --> 01:26:08,449
<i>It means "Let's fuck".</i>

1015
01:26:09,665 --> 01:26:12,830
<i>The code grew, and grew
as the time went by.</i>

1016
01:26:12,831 --> 01:26:16,335
<i>And within a few weeks, we could
talk about almost anything...</i>

1017
01:26:16,336 --> 01:26:18,323
<i>without even opening our mouths.</i>

1018
01:27:49,337 --> 01:27:50,637
Stop it.

1019
01:27:50,638 --> 01:27:53,115
That's enough, show my
parents some respect.

1020
01:27:53,116 --> 01:27:54,761
They're playing you music.

1021
01:27:56,102 --> 01:27:57,402
That's ok.

1022
01:27:57,403 --> 01:28:00,334
No mother, that's not ok.

1023
01:28:00,887 --> 01:28:02,492
Please continue.

1024
01:28:02,493 --> 01:28:05,842
Do you want me to play same
piece or something else.

1025
01:28:06,962 --> 01:28:08,262
Something else.

1026
01:28:32,314 --> 01:28:34,439
Didn't your parents play beautifully?

1027
01:28:37,478 --> 01:28:40,599
Yes they did, it's wonderful.

1028
01:28:47,071 --> 01:28:49,946
<i>We love each other, and we suit each other.</i>

1029
01:28:49,947 --> 01:28:52,784
<i>And that's the reason why we
decide to leave the woods...</i>

1030
01:28:52,785 --> 01:28:55,210
<i>and stay together forever in the city</i>

1031
01:29:04,639 --> 01:29:08,394
<i>tomorrow, during the hunt,
we're going to disappear...</i>

1032
01:29:08,395 --> 01:29:10,879
<i>and everyone would think we been captured.</i>

1033
01:29:11,385 --> 01:29:15,492
<i>And then we're going to turn
into dogs or canary something.</i>

1034
01:29:30,665 --> 01:29:33,807
<i>I think the first thing I'm going
to do when I get into the city...</i>

1035
01:29:33,808 --> 01:29:35,138
<i>is buy a bathrobe.</i>

1036
01:29:35,139 --> 01:29:38,282
<i>And then we're going to a pool
with high diving board...</i>

1037
01:29:38,283 --> 01:29:39,583
<i>perfect for diving.</i>

1038
01:29:39,756 --> 01:29:44,258
And then we do lots of different things
together, serious thing, not silly one...

1039
01:29:44,259 --> 01:29:48,517
like go for a walk in the park
or play the guitar together...

1040
01:29:49,146 --> 01:29:50,459
It stops there.

1041
01:29:50,460 --> 01:29:53,253
There's notes at the back, but
I don't think it's important.

1042
01:29:53,254 --> 01:29:54,554
Read the notes.

1043
01:29:56,414 --> 01:29:58,729
PORTOFINO: Italy fishing village...

1044
01:29:58,730 --> 01:30:02,785
upmarket resort famous for
its picturesque harbour.

1045
01:30:02,786 --> 01:30:05,194
POPULATION: 439

1046
01:30:05,688 --> 01:30:10,794
BEACHS NEARBY: Paraggi
beach, Camogli, Chiavari...

1047
01:30:10,795 --> 01:30:12,095
and Lavagna.

1048
01:30:12,483 --> 01:30:17,262
SERIFOS: Greek island located
in the western Cyclades.

1049
01:30:17,263 --> 01:30:18,563
Where did you find that?

1050
01:30:19,134 --> 01:30:20,622
By the river.

1051
01:30:20,623 --> 01:30:22,936
Someone must've dropped it during the hunt.

1052
01:30:23,634 --> 01:30:24,934
Give it to me

1053
01:30:25,961 --> 01:30:27,447
I'll take care of it.

1054
01:30:37,513 --> 01:30:40,963
Can you imagine why I brought
you to such quiet place today?

1055
01:30:48,095 --> 01:30:49,395
No.

1056
01:30:50,387 --> 01:30:53,414
Because I think it's the
perfect spot for your grave.

1057
01:31:42,074 --> 01:31:44,292
Now cover yourself with soit.

1058
01:31:44,293 --> 01:31:46,249
Use your hands.

1059
01:32:03,687 --> 01:32:04,987
Over your face too.

1060
01:32:04,988 --> 01:32:08,167
You wouldn't want your face to
get eaten by dogs, would you?

1061
01:32:35,317 --> 01:32:40,150
If you die before me, I'll visit
you as often as I can, I promise

1062
01:32:51,653 --> 01:32:54,807
I think we should leave right now.

1063
01:32:56,110 --> 01:32:58,699
The three of us coming here...

1064
01:32:59,201 --> 01:33:02,427
in stead of two or four is very dangerous.

1065
01:33:03,322 --> 01:33:06,099
How didn't we think it early.

1066
01:33:06,873 --> 01:33:10,092
Highly likely the doctor will suspect us

1067
01:33:10,777 --> 01:33:15,066
I suggest that we leave
the first chance we get.

1068
01:33:15,656 --> 01:33:17,819
Right now in the fact.

1069
01:33:18,674 --> 01:33:20,381
Don't be afraid.

1070
01:33:21,299 --> 01:33:23,586
No one will suspect a thing

1071
01:33:24,169 --> 01:33:27,240
I bet you aren't expect the surprise

1072
01:33:28,522 --> 01:33:30,942
isn't it wonderful?
Yes it is.

1073
01:33:32,452 --> 01:33:36,339
Still I like a few days just
to think it over so that...

1074
01:33:36,994 --> 01:33:39,864
I could maybe have the surgery...

1075
01:33:40,604 --> 01:33:43,006
when next time come to the city?

1076
01:33:44,971 --> 01:33:47,039
What is that to think about?

1077
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:51,035
It's better to see clearly, or
to be short-sighted? Is that it?

1078
01:33:52,208 --> 01:33:54,275
That's absurd, you know that.

1079
01:33:54,276 --> 01:33:56,698
Anyway, this doctor is the best as is.

1080
01:33:56,699 --> 01:33:59,789
And it's very difficult
to get a appointment

1081
01:33:59,790 --> 01:34:02,905
I called him months ago to
get him to see you today.

1082
01:34:54,406 --> 01:34:57,770
She's blind
Thank you.

1083
01:35:25,060 --> 01:35:27,477
Throw down your knife and stand up.

1084
01:35:30,851 --> 01:35:33,179
Why did you have to blind me?

1085
01:35:33,180 --> 01:35:35,245
You could blind him?

1086
01:35:35,261 --> 01:35:37,808
I have no idea what you're talking about.

1087
01:35:37,809 --> 01:35:40,496
The drugs are messing with you head.

1088
01:35:40,497 --> 01:35:44,514
If I were you, I would try and be a
little braver about the whole thing.

1089
01:35:44,895 --> 01:35:47,139
And now get up and give me your knife.

1090
01:35:47,582 --> 01:35:50,429
Or I'll hit you and take it by force.

1091
01:35:50,922 --> 01:35:52,222
Here I come

1092
01:35:52,223 --> 01:35:54,688
I swear I'll kill you.

1093
01:36:06,781 --> 01:36:08,149
Let go of my hair.

1094
01:36:08,150 --> 01:36:09,695
You're hurting me.

1095
01:36:29,561 --> 01:36:33,328
Just think that when someone goes blind.

1096
01:36:33,329 --> 01:36:38,549
One of other senses is heightened.

1097
01:37:14,386 --> 01:37:19,214
You could also capture a dog in the
woods, and train him to guide you.

1098
01:37:19,873 --> 01:37:22,012
Dog can do that, you know?

1099
01:37:22,792 --> 01:37:25,182
I'll help you catch a dog myself.

1100
01:37:26,458 --> 01:37:29,811
Now calm down, or I'm going
to leave you here...

1101
01:37:29,812 --> 01:37:33,442
and I don't think you'll manage to
find meeting of two on your own.

1102
01:37:47,276 --> 01:37:48,847
Are you enjoying the view.

1103
01:37:50,457 --> 01:37:51,757
Sure.

1104
01:37:54,600 --> 01:37:56,406
What happened to your hand?

1105
01:37:57,760 --> 01:38:00,441
I was cutting a tree branch with a knife...

1106
01:38:00,442 --> 01:38:02,247
and I cut myself by accident.

1107
01:38:02,248 --> 01:38:05,765
You look handsome today,
did you get you haircut?

1108
01:38:05,766 --> 01:38:08,241
Thank you, no, I didn't get my haircut

1109
01:38:08,534 --> 01:38:10,449
I'm going to get my haircut today.

1110
01:38:11,019 --> 01:38:12,571
Look what I brought you?

1111
01:38:12,572 --> 01:38:16,265
Oh, thank you so much, I'm so
hungry, I'll eat it right away

1112
01:38:16,475 --> 01:38:19,395
it's a big flashlight
Oh, I'm sorry.

1113
01:38:20,378 --> 01:38:22,623
It's so big, I thought it was a rabbit.

1114
01:38:23,039 --> 01:38:25,369
The biggest flashlight I've ever seen.

1115
01:38:27,678 --> 01:38:29,401
Are you ready for today.

1116
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:31,351
Of course I am

1117
01:38:35,296 --> 01:38:36,628
I want to tell you something,..

1118
01:38:36,629 --> 01:38:38,483
But please don't be angry.

1119
01:38:39,611 --> 01:38:41,274
Ok, what's wrong?

1120
01:38:41,900 --> 01:38:43,886
I can't see anything

1121
01:38:44,819 --> 01:38:46,406
I'm blind.

1122
01:38:46,688 --> 01:38:48,071
What do you mean?

1123
01:38:49,333 --> 01:38:51,466
There is no point to lying to you.

1124
01:38:51,467 --> 01:38:53,466
You'll find out soon or later.

1125
01:38:54,508 --> 01:38:57,467
Our leader blinded me in the city.

1126
01:38:58,072 --> 01:39:02,421
She must've realised I
love you, you love me...

1127
01:39:02,422 --> 01:39:06,219
and we're going to run
away to the city together

1128
01:39:08,589 --> 01:39:09,889
I'm sorry.

1129
01:39:12,521 --> 01:39:14,204
You can't see at all?

1130
01:39:15,726 --> 01:39:17,509
No, not at all.

1131
01:39:19,135 --> 01:39:21,786
And why you asked for my haircut?

1132
01:39:24,235 --> 01:39:26,142
I was just saying that...

1133
01:39:27,862 --> 01:39:30,863
so you wouldn't realise I could't see

1134
01:39:33,369 --> 01:39:34,854
I'm sorry.

1135
01:39:35,593 --> 01:39:39,551
Don't cry, cry will make
our eyes hurt more.

1136
01:39:43,082 --> 01:39:44,656
We'll find a way.

1137
01:40:02,050 --> 01:40:03,680
What blood type are you?

1138
01:40:04,862 --> 01:40:06,162
B

1139
01:40:17,763 --> 01:40:21,358
<i>From the first time I saw
her, I knew she was the one.</i>

1140
01:40:21,766 --> 01:40:25,008
<i>As she stared in my eyes and smiled.</i>

1141
01:40:25,430 --> 01:40:28,585
<i>And her lips were the colour of the roses.</i>

1142
01:40:29,034 --> 01:40:33,013
<i>That grew down the river,
all bloody and wild.</i>

1143
01:40:37,282 --> 01:40:40,064
Do you like berries? Blue berries?
Black berries?

1144
01:40:40,065 --> 01:40:42,165
No, no
Oh.

1145
01:40:43,702 --> 01:40:45,263
Can you play the piano?

1146
01:40:45,918 --> 01:40:47,251
No.

1147
01:40:54,869 --> 01:40:56,188
Plastic cup.

1148
01:40:56,189 --> 01:40:59,187
That's right, very good.

1149
01:41:01,459 --> 01:41:03,088
Do you speak German?

1150
01:41:05,997 --> 01:41:07,297
No

1151
01:41:09,055 --> 01:41:10,742
I could teach you German.

1152
01:41:11,895 --> 01:41:15,214
It would take a least a year for you be
able to speak the basic not fluently.

1153
01:41:15,215 --> 01:41:16,731
So there is no point.

1154
01:41:16,732 --> 01:41:20,438
You know, German is one of the most
difficult language in the world to learn.

1155
01:41:20,439 --> 01:41:23,486
Because its grammar is very complicated

1156
01:41:26,949 --> 01:41:28,852
I brought you something.

1157
01:41:30,896 --> 01:41:32,196
Fish.

1158
01:41:36,920 --> 01:41:40,045
<i>On the second day, I brought her a flower.</i>

1159
01:41:40,644 --> 01:41:44,263
<i>She was more beautiful
than any woman I'd seen.</i>

1160
01:41:44,264 --> 01:41:48,211
<i>"And I said," Do you know
where the wild roses grow...</i>

1161
01:41:48,212 --> 01:41:51,603
<i>So sweet and scarlet and free?"</i>

1162
01:41:57,337 --> 01:42:01,590
Kiwi
That's right, 10 out of 10, then again.

1163
01:42:03,650 --> 01:42:05,189
Can I give you a kiss?

1164
01:42:08,859 --> 01:42:11,953
I can't thank you enough for all
the activities and games...

1165
01:42:11,954 --> 01:42:15,174
to keep me company.

1166
01:42:15,175 --> 01:42:17,284
But you know we can't do that anymore.

1167
01:42:20,063 --> 01:42:23,160
Would you like to play another
round of touch, guess thing, win.

1168
01:42:23,161 --> 01:42:25,624
No, that's enough for today.

1169
01:42:27,332 --> 01:42:30,807
In any case, I run out of
things to test you with.

1170
01:42:32,198 --> 01:42:36,033
Maybe tomorrow, or one of these days

1171
01:42:36,034 --> 01:42:37,559
tomorrow morning?

1172
01:42:38,006 --> 01:42:39,419
We'll see.

1173
01:42:44,296 --> 01:42:46,408
Bye
Bye.

1174
01:43:19,272 --> 01:43:20,572
Good afternoon.

1175
01:43:23,256 --> 01:43:24,737
How are you?

1176
01:43:25,216 --> 01:43:26,516
Fine

1177
01:43:27,754 --> 01:43:29,282
I'm hungry.

1178
01:43:30,021 --> 01:43:32,813
You haven't brought me a rabbit for days,..

1179
01:43:33,465 --> 01:43:36,638
Or things for me to touch and guess

1180
01:43:37,829 --> 01:43:39,333
I've got good news

1181
01:43:39,761 --> 01:43:41,498
I had a great idea.

1182
01:43:42,720 --> 01:43:44,151
Have you a minute?

1183
01:43:44,949 --> 01:43:46,702
What kind of idea?

1184
01:43:49,825 --> 01:43:51,850
I raise my left foot

1185
01:43:53,467 --> 01:43:56,995
I bring my elbow to my
knee, and tap it twice

1186
01:43:57,775 --> 01:44:00,863
I bring my foot to my knee,
and tap it three times.

1187
01:44:00,864 --> 01:44:03,724
And I face down, I knee down

1188
01:44:04,295 --> 01:44:08,568
I touch my left cheek,
and then lie face up.

1189
01:44:14,947 --> 01:44:17,552
You're sure you prepare to do that?

1190
01:44:22,921 --> 01:44:24,911
Yes, of course I'm sure

1191
01:44:25,481 --> 01:44:28,074
I wouldn't propose otherwise.

1192
01:44:32,747 --> 01:44:34,255
When?

1193
01:44:35,324 --> 01:44:36,767
Tomorrow.

1194
01:44:43,146 --> 01:44:44,683
Tomorrow.

1195
01:46:36,365 --> 01:46:38,659
We should speed up a little

1196
01:46:41,793 --> 01:46:43,893
I can't go much faster.

1197
01:46:43,894 --> 01:46:46,799
These trousers are too tight, I'm sorry.

1198
01:46:47,785 --> 01:46:50,203
It was dark, I couldn't see clearly.

1199
01:46:50,204 --> 01:46:52,959
And I didn't have time to try them on

1200
01:46:52,960 --> 01:46:54,699
I'm sorry.

1201
01:46:56,850 --> 01:46:58,388
Never mind.

1202
01:47:01,777 --> 01:47:03,487
There is a bus coming.

1203
01:47:28,068 --> 01:47:29,840
It was the hotel coach.

1204
01:47:30,246 --> 01:47:32,193
They didn't see us.

1205
01:47:57,972 --> 01:47:59,272
Profile.

1206
01:48:09,707 --> 01:48:11,007
Fingers.

1207
01:48:18,939 --> 01:48:20,306
Elbows.

1208
01:48:40,386 --> 01:48:42,531
Would you like me to show you my belly?

1209
01:48:42,532 --> 01:48:46,917
No, I remember you belly very well.

1210
01:48:49,806 --> 01:48:51,106
Smile.

1211
01:49:09,837 --> 01:49:11,937
Can I have a knife and fork please?

1212
01:49:11,938 --> 01:49:14,071
Not a butter knife, steak knife.

1213
01:49:14,072 --> 01:49:15,372
Second.

1214
01:49:29,209 --> 01:49:30,509
Thank you

1215
01:49:39,661 --> 01:49:41,771
I'm going to do with the knife.

1216
01:49:41,772 --> 01:49:45,680
Do you want me to come with you?
I rather you didn't.

1217
01:49:46,839 --> 01:49:48,556
Don't worry.

1218
01:49:49,248 --> 01:49:52,742
It's strange at first,
but you get used to it.

1219
01:49:53,491 --> 01:49:55,518
And you other senses are heightened.

1220
01:49:55,519 --> 01:49:58,950
Touch, for example, and hearing

1221
01:49:58,951 --> 01:50:00,402
I know

1222
01:50:11,312 --> 01:50:12,981
I won't be long.

1223
01:51:40,301 --> 01:51:41,601
Thank you very much

1224
