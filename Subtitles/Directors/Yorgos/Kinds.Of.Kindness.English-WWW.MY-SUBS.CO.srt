14
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,653
Come on in.

15
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,156
Yes, he just arrived.

16
00:01:58,034 --> 00:02:01,955
He is wearing beige pants,
brown leather derby lace ups,

17
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:04,666
a white shirt
with what must be
his initials on it.

18
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:05,708
B.M.F.?

19
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:08,336
No, I'm sorry, R.M.F.

20
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,882
No, I'm not short-sighted,
Raymond, it's just that

21
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:15,301
the R is badly embroidered
and it looks like a B.

22
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:21,391
No, his shirt's ironed
just fine.

23
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:22,475
Would you like me
to take a photo

24
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:23,768
and send it for you to see?

25
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:40,577
Yes, I told you, it's fine.

26
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:46,374
Okay. Okay.

27
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:50,503
Raymond,
the note that you left me

28
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:53,006
this morning was perfect.

29
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:56,885
I'm going to water the plants
and then...

30
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:59,637
I think I might practice
playing the song on the piano.

31
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:03,683
It's been so long since I last
practiced playing the piano.

32
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,476
Does it hurt anywhere else?

33
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,354
My arm hurts.

34
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,648
Probably broken.

35
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:35,942
I think you should take me

36
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:38,361
to the nearest hospital
right away.

37
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:41,990
I... I should definitely be
examined by a doctor.

38
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,866
It's probably best
they keep me in

39
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:45,785
for a few days
for observation.

40
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,871
There might be some sort of
internal bleeding

41
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:49,914
or something.

42
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,166
Don't worry,

43
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,751
they'll check you for
everything at the hospital.

44
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,103
Good morning, darling.

45
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:36,521
Good morning.

46
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,189
You got in late last night.

47
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,526
Sorry, I was asleep
before 11:00.

48
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:42,985
It's fine.

49
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:45,655
I got held up at the office,
that's why I was late.

50
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:49,450
Hmm.

51
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,371
What happened
to your forehead?

52
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,665
It's nothing.
There was an accident

53
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:58,376
on the drive home last night,
but it's nothing serious.

54
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,753
What do you mean?
Shouldn't you see a doctor?

55
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:03,089
I went by the hospital
last night,

56
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:06,551
but they assured me
it's nothing that, um...

57
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,136
They just gave me
some tranquilizers.

58
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:09,720
Robert,
you should've called.

59
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,432
You went to the hospital
on your own?

60
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:15,601
It was nothing.
There's no need to worry.

61
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,903
Raymond sent it yesterday.

62
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,238
He is such a sweet man.

63
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,157
I don't know how
we can ever repay him

64
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:31,367
after everything
he's done for us.

65
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:35,037
A genuine smashed
McEnroe racket from 1984.

66
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:37,123
It must have cost him
a fortune.

67
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,458
Isn't it wonderful, Robert?

68
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:39,792
Yes, it's wonderful.

69
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:44,213
Give Raymond a kiss for me.
I'll give him a call, too.

70
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:45,882
I rang him just now,
but he didn't pick up

71
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,133
and I didn't want
to call again right away,

72
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,634
in case I woke him.

73
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:50,011
Sure, I'll do that.

74
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:52,597
Tell him it's the nicest thing
he's ever given us.

75
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:53,973
I'll tell him.

76
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:07,778
"Tomorrow, Wednesday,
wake-up time, 0700 hours.

77
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,614

"No sexual intercourse.

87
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,886
Hello.

88
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,387
Good morning, Robert.

89
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:36,015
Good morning, Louise.

90
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:38,434
Mr. Frischmann wants
to see you in his office.

91
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,228
Three o'clock, in his office.

92
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,397
Uh,
I might need to pass by

93
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:45,107
the construction site
this afternoon.

94
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:46,984
I might not make it
back in time.

95
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,112
If I were you,
I wouldn't pass by

96
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:51,989
the construction site
this afternoon.

97
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,951
Mr. Frischmann wants to
see you in his office at 3:00.

98
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:59,747
All right,
then, Louise.
Thank you. Bye.

99
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:07,547
Hi. Can I go in,
or is he busy?

100
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:09,465
He's just on the phone.
Won't be long.

101
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,103
Have I ever shown you
my son?

102
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,104
No.

103
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,030
He's adorable.

104
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,199
-Isn't he?
-He really is.

105
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:40,371
Aren't you and Sarah
thinking of having children?

106
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,747
Sarah can't have children.

107
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:43,791
She has this issue
with her ovaries.

108
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,418
Sorry, I had no idea.

109
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:46,502
That's all right.

110
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,643
Good afternoon, Robert.

111
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,145
Don't just stand there,
sit down.

112
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:05,396
Were you waiting long?

113
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,897
No, 15 minutes or so.

114
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:09,609
Hey,
your hair's nice like that.

115
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,527
Don't get it cut,
let it grow a little longer.

116
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:14,196
And you've lost more weight,
I think.

117
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:18,784
Skinny men are the most
ridiculous thing there is.

118
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:22,121
We've gone over this before,
you must put on a few pounds.

119
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,956
I told you that last time.

120
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:26,167
-But I have.
-You most certainly have not.

121
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,085
You're even skinnier now.

122
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,671
We'll have to take
another look

123
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,381
at your eating plan
for the week.

124
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,636
Did you read Anna Karenina?

125
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:38,721
I'm just finishing it off.
There's a few pages left.

126
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,306
Sit.

127
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,809
Will you have something
to drink?

128
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,479
I would love a vodka.

129
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,610
I will be joining you
after all,

130
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,696
for, uh, your trip to Munich.

131
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,323
I reckon I can make it.
They won't need me

132
00:10:57,365 --> 00:11:00,534
at the construction site here
next week anyway.

133
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,411
Sarah might be joining us too.

134
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,706
If you don't mind, that is.

135
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,709
Also, maybe
she told you already,

136
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:11,087
but she loved the racket.

137
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:13,798
Said it was the best gift
you've ever given us.

138
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,800
That's great.
You know what?

139
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,220
I didn't pour you a vodka.

140
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:21,722
I think a whiskey now
would be much better.

141
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:25,184
Yes, right,
a whiskey is much better.

142
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,564
Raymond,
I'm sorry about yesterday.

143
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:32,108
Truly sorry.

144
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,119
What did you do today?

145
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,246
I woke up at 7:30, showered,

146
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:47,790
didn't wash my hair,
and then drank my juice.

147
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:50,042
-Orange and lemon?
-Orange and lemon.

148
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:52,294
Did you and Sarah
fuck this morning?

149
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:54,672
At 8:30,
right after breakfast.

150
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,508
Very good.
I spoke with Sarah

151
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,677
an hour ago.

152
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:03,097
And yes, she did say
she liked the gift very much.

153
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,474
Yes, she said
it was the nicest thing

154
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:06,559
you've ever given us.

155
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,602
She liked it
more than Ayrton Senna's

156
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:11,021
-scorched racing helmet?
-Oh, much more.

157
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,608
-Thank you so much.
-Oh, no, thank you.

158
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:18,237
You deserve all these things.
It's the least I can do.

159
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:21,240
Raymond...

160
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:26,871
sorry again about yesterday.
I don't know what went wrong.

161
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,039
I should have
been hospitalized.

162
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,208
The doctor just couldn't
be trusted, he must...

163
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,835
The doctor who saw you
is excellent,

164
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:36,255
he's a friend of mine.
And I spoke with him earlier

165
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:38,799
and he said
that there was really no need

166
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,217
to have you hospitalized

167
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,510
for a scratch
on your forehead.

168
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,596
My back hurts.

169
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,600
Here and here.

170
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:49,518
Robert, listen.
It doesn't matter.

171
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,270
These things happen.

172
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,688
And anyway...

173
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,024
I'm going to give you
a chance to make it up to me.

174
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,526
We're going to
repeat the crash

175
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:58,944
two days from now,

176
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,780
and this time
you can do it right.

177
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:02,823
Same place, same time,

178
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,826
same midnight blue BMW.

179
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:12,041
Ram into him at a higher speed
and everything will be fine.

180
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,419
I can't crash
any faster, Raymond.

181
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,587
Robert...

182
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:17,797
in two days,

183
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,715
it'll be happening again,

184
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:22,051
and you'll see to it
that you're driving faster.

185
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:27,932
-I don't think I can do that.
-Really now, Robert...

186
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,475
I don't have time for this.

187
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:35,314
You have two hours
to think it over.

188
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:37,691
Go to Cheval, sit at the bar.

189
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:40,152
Ask them
to bring you a drink,

190
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,779
something nonalcoholic

191
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,864
so it doesn't
cloud your judgment.

192
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,158
Then come by my house tonight

193
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,369
and let me know
what you've decided.

194
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,870
Good evening, sir.

195
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,205
Good evening.

196
00:13:58,504 --> 00:13:59,922
What can I get you?

197
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,758
I'd like a double
Johnnie Walker Red

198
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,926
on the rocks, please.

199
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:09,098
Just kidding.
A Virgin Mary, please.

200
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:10,307
Right away, sir.

201
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,104
That was quick.

202
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:16,605
Enjoy.

203
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,431
Hey, Robert.

204
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:56,645
Sorry, Robert. Vivian and I
were just having

205
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:59,356
a very interesting
conversation about palm trees,

206
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,150
so I'll be with you
in just a moment.

207
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:04,028
Uh, so,
tell me about that weevil.

208
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,698
Yes. So...

209
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,742
there's this weevil
that's destroying them.

210
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:11,035
It's carried on the wind.

211
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:13,078
So, it has wings?

212
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,205
Or it's very light,
I don't know.

213
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,291
And it only attacks
palm trees.

214
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,709
And so now...

215
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,461
it's illegal to buy or sell
palm trees

216
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:22,880
in various places
across Europe and Africa.

217
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:26,216
Which means that you can't
just walk into a nursery

218
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,509
and buy a palm tree,

219
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:30,596
because they're banned
because of this weevil.

220
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:33,349
So, now they're bought
and sold on the black market.

221
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,518
And this weevil
only attacks palm trees?

222
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,896
Yes. Only palm trees.

223
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:40,773
Okay.

224
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:45,361
That is really amazing.

225
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,242
I'll leave you two
alone now.

226
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:54,954
Amazing, eh?

227
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,664
-Really amazing.
-Huh.

228
00:15:58,332 --> 00:15:59,541
Right then, Robert.

229
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,963
I'm all ears.

230
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:05,673
Yes.

231
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:11,136
Raymond, I've given this
a lot of thought,

232
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:13,847
and I can't do
what you're asking me to do.

233
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:16,183
Again. You come in
and sit down there

234
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,393
before you speak.

235
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:21,814
-Raymond.
-I want you to come in

236
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:24,441
and sit down there
before you speak. Vivian.

237
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,620
I'll leave you two alone now.

238
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,793
-Raymond, I've thought...
-And, actually,

239
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,212
it was better when you said it
standing up, so...

240
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:46,922
go out and come back in.

241
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,966
Do it by yourself.
Without Vivian.

242
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,218
Raymond, please.

243
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,563
Raymond, I can't do

244
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:04,648
what you asked me to do.
I'm sorry.

245
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:09,486
Anything else you want, yes.

246
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,613
But that one thing,
it's just too frightening.

247
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,907
If I crash any faster...

248
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,409
the other driver
might be killed.

249
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,161
Yes.

250
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,288
I know
what might happen, Robert.

251
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,249
And the driver
of the other vehicle

252
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,668
is fine with losing his life,

253
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,462
he's agreed to it in fact,

254
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:28,505
so there's really no

255
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:31,800
need for you
to worry about that. If you...

256
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,803
really don't want to
disappoint me...

257
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:37,306
that is, Robert.

258
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:41,769
If you truly love me, I mean.

259
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,397
What you're asking,

260
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:46,857
it's too much.

261
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,443
I love you, Raymond,
I love you.

262
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,278
But this is too much.

263
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,323
No, no, no.
You don't love me at all.

264
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,285
I can feel it.
This isn't love.

265
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,579
I don't know what it is,

266
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:03,040
but it's clearly not love.
But, no matter.

267
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,919
I knew this day would come.
It's fine.

268
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:10,130
Ten years it lasted.

269
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:13,133
That's not nothing.

270
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:15,010
The truth is...

271
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:18,055
I expected you
to tire of it all far sooner.

272
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:22,434
Can I just
say something?

273
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:23,977
This doesn't have
anything to do with love.

274
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:26,146
Right then, Robert,
you're free now.

275
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,440
You can go on your way.
Tonight,

276
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:32,528
tomorrow, and every day
from now on, you're free to

277
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:35,280
sleep whenever you like,
fuck whenever you like.

278
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:37,783
Have however many children
you like.

279
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,451
Wear whatever socks you like.

280
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,037
Raymond, please.

281
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:45,958
I never denied you anything.

282
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:49,253
Even when you asked me...

283
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,507
told me not to have
any children.

284
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,717
I wasn't happy about it,
but I didn't say a word.

285
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:58,929
Ask me for anything else
you want and I'll do it.

286
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,056
But I can't be responsible

287
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,432
for another man's death.

288
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,478
I'm tired, Robert.

289
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:11,817
You don't have to give me
anything back.

290
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:14,153
You can stay in the house
you've been living in

291
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:15,654
and keep the car of course.

292
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:18,824
Goodbye, Robert.

293
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:42,741
They took the racket.

294
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,285
What did you say?

295
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:48,288
Raymond came in
during the night

296
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,748
while we were sleeping

297
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,166
and took the racket.

298
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,049
That's so strange.

299
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,550
Who could have
taken the racket?

300
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,305
The alarm didn't go off.

301
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:08,558
I'm calling the police.

302
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,728
Raymond knows
the code, darling.

303
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:14,982
To be precise,

304
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:16,525
he picked the code
out himself.

305
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:17,776
You didn't know that.

306
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:22,656
1962. The year he was born.

307
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,158
And there's more.

308
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,870
The two of us are together

309
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:31,581
because that's what
he decided.

310
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:35,752
That night in Cheval,

311
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:38,088
he picked you out for me.

312
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:41,091
He saw you
sitting there on your own

313
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,010
and he told me to go over
and flirt with you.

314
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:45,095
I liked you a lot too...

315
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:48,432
don't get me wrong,
but he made me do it.

316
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:53,145
He suggested I make it
seem like an accident,

317
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:56,732
told me to pretend I'd hurt
my hand to get us talking.

318
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:59,359
The notes in the flowers

319
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,445
I sent you, he wrote those.

320
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,071
He picked out this house,

321
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,364
these stools,

322
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,158
-he picked out this robe...
-Robert,

323
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:07,951
you need to be
heading to the office.

324
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:08,994
I'm not done yet.

325
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:11,913
There's one last thing.

326
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,208
I never told you this before.

327
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,337
And it's terrible...

328
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:20,172
what I'm about to tell you,
I know that...

329
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,343
but you need to hear it.

330
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:27,012
The reason we never
managed to have a child

331
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,221
all these years,

332
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:31,808
is not because you couldn't.

333
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:34,102
It's because...

334
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:38,982
it's because
Raymond was secretly

335
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,985
paying doctors
to mess things up.

336
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:48,492
Those weren't miscarriages,
Sarah, they were abortions.

337
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,349
The wireless
customer you called

338
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,017
is not available at this time.

339
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:52,973
Sarah.

340
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:08,071
Sarah.

341
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:38,143
The wireless customer
you called is not available...

342
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:51,948
Okay, safely.
Safely. Safely.

343
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,409
Remember, it's not a race.

344
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:57,037
All right. Great job.

345
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:58,663
Kick. Don't forget to kick.

346
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:01,917
Very good. Very good.

347
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:04,544
All right.

348
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:06,046
Yeah, get your kickboard
if you need it.

349
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:08,632
Robert, I haven't seen you
in so long.

350
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:09,966
Have you lost weight?

351
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:13,053
Will, is Sarah around?

352
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:16,765
Sarah quit. This morning.
Over the phone too.

353
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:19,434
Ah, she quit.

354
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:21,561
She did tell me
she was planning to,

355
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,980
but I've had so much work
recently, Will,

356
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,066
you can't imagine
how much work,

357
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:27,317
and I forgot all about it.

358
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,944
I did ask
if it was health-related,

359
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:32,322
but she said no.
I just, I hope
it's nothing serious.

360
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,448
No, no, she just

361
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:36,493
tired herself out lately,
that's all.

362
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,828
I'm sure you'll have
a great time in Munich.

363
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,330
Why don't you stay there
a few extra days?

364
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:41,873
I'm sure things will be better
when you get back.

365
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:43,875
When are you flying out?

366
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:45,794
In a couple of days.

367
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:00,058
-Robert.
-Where is my wife?

368
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,145
Raymond isn't here right now,

369
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:05,814
and I'm getting ready
to head out myself.

370
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:08,900
Then I'll wait for him
to get back. Sarah!

371
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:10,026
He left for Germany.

372
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:15,198
Is my wife with him?
Did they go together?

373
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,658
Robert, get out.

374
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,329
Are the three of you
fucking maybe?

375
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:24,165
Get out of my house
right now

376
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:26,126
or I will call Raymond
and you will rue the day

377
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:27,252
that you ever set
foot in here.

378
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:31,006
I suggest,

379
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:32,882
you run back home
to your mom and dad,

380
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,467
while you still can.

381
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:36,386
Because getting fucked

382
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,930
by an old man like Raymond,
you deserve better than that.

383
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:42,225
Getting fucked by an old man
like Raymond

384
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:45,228
is, however,
exactly what you deserve.

385
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,230
You're pathetic.
Get out of my sight.

386
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:05,332
Good evening.

387
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:11,254
This here is
Ayrton Senna's helmet.

388
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,256
The blue and green
stripes symbolized

389
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,008
speed and aggression,

390
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:19,220
whereas the yellow all over
symbolized youth.

391
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,682
Mmm.

392
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:29,314
What was it
the yellow symbolized?

393
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:31,274
Youth.

394
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:38,865
These are the shoes
worn by Michael Jordan,

395
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:42,160
in the game against
the Washington Bullets in '84

396
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:45,955
when he led the Bulls
to a home win by 16 points.

397
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:49,000
Hmm. $10,000.

398
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,085
For what?

399
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:51,836
For everything.

400
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:56,049
You can't be serious.

401
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:58,635
That ping pong ball alone
is worth $5,000.

402
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:05,600
$12,000.

403
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:11,773
$20,000 at least.

404
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:13,525
$12,000.

405
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:20,532
Yes, good morning.

406
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:24,160
Uh, can I speak
with Mr. Smith please?

407
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:26,246
It's Robert Fletcher.
Thank you.

408
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:32,085
Mr. Smith, I would like to
see you if I can.

409
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:33,461
I'd like to speak with you.

410
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:37,173
Yes.

411
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:42,387
No, no, tomorrow's fine.
Should I come by your office?

412
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:46,641
In the afternoon sometime?

413
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:50,353
Yes, that's perfect.

414
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,273
Raymond?

415
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:54,357
Raymond's well.

416
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,861
He's in Germany,
on a business trip.

417
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:00,989
Sarah, I'm worried.

418
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:04,409
Please call to let me know
you're okay.

419
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:06,202
And I have some good news.

420
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:08,329
I'm meeting with
Edward Smith tomorrow.

421
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:10,957
You know how much
he wants me to work for him.

422
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:14,169
He'll go nuts
when I tell him I'm available.

423
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:18,131
Please, Sarah, come home.

424
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:20,675
I miss you.

425
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:22,719
I know you miss me too.

426
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:25,013
I'm sorry if I upset you.

427
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:27,390
I love you very much.

428
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:29,476
Okay. Bye.

429
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:38,985
Excuse me, do you know
if Mr. Smith will be long?

430
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:41,738
I'm not sure, Mr. Fletcher.
I don't imagine so.

431
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:43,823
He's in his office?

432
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:45,158
No, he's out.

433
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:50,455
But he knows I'm here,
right?

434
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:53,583
He's well aware of all
the appointments he has today.

435
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,210
Don't you worry about that.

436
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:01,466
Is that
cute little boy
your son?

437
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:03,426
My grandson.

438
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:07,514
I don't have
any children.

439
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:10,642
My wife had this issue,
you see,

440
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:11,726
but she's all better now

441
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:13,186
and we're thinking
of having one.

442
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:14,312
That's great.

443
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:29,410
Hello.

444
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:32,872
Yes. Of course.

445
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:40,255
Hmm. Mr. Fletcher,
I just spoke with Mr. Smith.

446
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:42,340
And?

447
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:44,884
Unfortunately
something came up

448
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:48,054
and he won't be
coming by the office today.

449
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:50,723
But we will be in touch

450
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:52,767
to arrange a new appointment.

451
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:56,271
Right.
How about I call you tomorrow?

452
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:57,897
We'll be in touch.

453
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:19,002
Are you ready
to order, sir?

454
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:23,923
Um, I don't know.
I can't decide.

455
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,677
I know I'm not hungry.

456
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:30,054
That's fine, sir.
How about something to drink?

457
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:31,681
Yes.

458
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,141
There's a wine list
on the back.

459
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:39,105
I'll have the...

460
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,611
Could you recommend me
a wine?

461
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:46,362
White? Red?

462
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:49,073
Whatever's best.
I mean, whatever you think.

463
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:51,326
I recommend a white Chardonnay
from New Zealand.

464
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:52,368
Perfect.

465
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:22,190
I slipped and hurt my hand.

466
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:24,150
I guess someone must've
spilled water on the floor.

467
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:26,736
It's probably just a sprain.

468
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:10,423
Good morning, Raymond.

469
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:12,842
Can I have just five minutes
of your time, please?

470
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,010
I'm afraid not.

471
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:17,180
Raymond, please.
I want to say I'm sorry.

472
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:19,724
I regret what I did,
it was totally unacceptable,

473
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:21,350
you have every right
to be angry.

474
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:23,102
Please forgive me.
I made a mistake.

475
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:24,353
I... I made a mistake.

476
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:25,938
I'm already running late.

477
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,565
I think the best thing
for you

478
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:29,859
is to go home
and calm yourself down.

479
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,194
I don't want to go home.

480
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:00,348
Good morning, Raymond.

481
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:01,933
Can I have just five minutes
of your time, please?

482
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:03,518
I'm afraid not.

483
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:04,727
Raymond.

484
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,604
Please, I had
a horrible dream
last night

485
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:08,856
and that's all
I've been seeing
in my sleep lately.

486
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,527
I want to say I'm sorry.

487
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:15,446
I regret what I did.
It was totally unacceptable

488
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:17,281
and you have every right
to be angry,

489
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:19,242
but please forgive me.

490
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:20,618
I made a mistake.

491
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,411
I'm already running late.

492
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:25,039
I think it's best you go home
and calm yourself down.

493
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:28,584
I don't want to go home,
Raymond. Can I come up

494
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,128
-to your office, please?
-No, you cannot.

495
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:31,337
I want to go up
to your office.

496
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:32,880
I think I made myself clear
the other day.

497
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:35,883
What you're doing now
is completely ridiculous.

498
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:37,176
Just go.

499
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:38,886
Before you
humiliate yourself

500
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:41,180
any more
than you already have.

501
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:42,849
It's for your own good.

502
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,433
Good morning.

503
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:47,145
Raymond, I'll do
whatever you tell me.

504
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:50,314
I'll never object
to anything ever again.

505
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:51,649
I've even started
gaining weight.

506
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:54,193
You can't imagine
how much I've been eating.

507
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:55,361
I ate two burgers

508
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:56,863
and drank two milkshakes
just now

509
00:35:56,904 --> 00:36:00,241
and I finished reading
Anna Karenina.

510
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:02,243
You were right.
It really was beautiful.

511
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:04,745
There were two moments
where I cried.

512
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:07,331
Go fuck yourself, Robert.

513
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:12,545
Yes, sir.

514
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:13,838
Two double
Johnnie Walker Reds

515
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,006
on the rocks, please.

516
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,337
-Hi.
-Hi, Rita.

517
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:21,382
Thank you so much.

518
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:25,511
No, no,
I wanted to thank you
for everything.

519
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:28,139
How's the foot?

520
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:32,643
Are you all right?

521
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:34,854
Are you hurt?

522
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:36,897
Just a lil...
a little.

523
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:38,482
A little?

524
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:40,943
I missed that step.
I didn't see it.

525
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,862
What step?

526
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:46,699
There's a step
in the men's bathroom.

527
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:48,117
Should I get you some ice?

528
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,661
No, don't worry.
It's nothing.

529
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:52,705
I wouldn't want
to trouble you.

530
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:55,291
Thank you so much, though.
You're very kind.

531
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,792
That doesn't look
like nothing.

532
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:58,836
Are you here with anyone?

533
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,379
No, it's just me.

534
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:05,634
I have this
exact same car.

535
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:07,970
Really?

536
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,182
What are the chances?

537
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:14,435
It hurts more now.

538
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:15,561
Well, hang in there.

539
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:16,979
We're only five minutes away.

540
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:22,360
Have I seen you
somewhere before?

541
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:24,737
Are you at that bar
and restaurant often?

542
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:26,238
No, that was
my first time there.

543
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:33,746
Are you an architect
by any chance?

544
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:36,707
No, I work
at an opticians downtown.

545
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:38,959
I'm Rita Fanning.

546
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:40,252
Robert Fletcher.

547
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:42,296
I know I've got
a lot of nerve,

548
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:44,882
what with you
taking me to the hospital

549
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:47,093
yesterday and all, but I have

550
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:49,220
one more favor to ask.

551
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:52,848
Sure, what is it?

552
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:55,476
I want to take you out
for dinner one night.

553
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:57,061
It's the least I can do

554
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:59,855
and it would make me
very happy.

555
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:03,150
-If it's not a chore.
-I'd like that.

556
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,528
It would be my pleasure.

557
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:06,862
-Really?
-Of course.

558
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,159
Tomorrow evening?

559
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:13,244
Tomorrow evening.

560
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:38,102
Rita, it's Robert.

561
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,313
Um, I hope you're okay.

562
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:43,357
I'm outside your house
right now.

563
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:48,028
I guess you
forgot about tonight.

564
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,405
Call me when you can.

565
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,739
Have a nice night.

566
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:56,388
Come in.

567
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:00,601
Hi, Rita.

568
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:01,644
Hi.

569
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:05,439
What happened?

570
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:07,233
How are you?

571
00:42:07,274 --> 00:42:08,692
I'm a little worse
than you were

572
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:10,194
that day at the restaurant.

573
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:13,405
I'm sorry
about the other night.

574
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:15,199
There's no need to apologize.
What happened?

575
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:17,952
I was driving home
from work and

576
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:21,163
I crashed into
another vehicle at
an intersection and...

577
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:24,500
I don't remember
anything after that.

578
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:25,834
I woke up and I was here.

579
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:29,421
What kind of vehicle was it?

580
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:32,299
A blue BMW I think.

581
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:35,803
What about the other driver?

582
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:37,513
The other driver was a man.

583
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:40,224
I don't know,
after a certain point

584
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:41,559
I don't remember a thing.

585
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:45,354
I mean, is he alive?

586
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:46,730
He's in pretty bad shape

587
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:49,066
from what I've heard,
but yes, he's alive.

588
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,527
That's fortunate.

589
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:56,824
I can't believe
this happened to you.

590
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:58,534
Are you in pain?

591
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,619
My shoulder hurts a little.

592
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:02,955
And to be honest,
my whole body does.

593
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:05,207
Would you like me to
call someone for you or

594
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:08,294
-can I get you anything?
-No, that's fine.

595
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:10,838
Actually, could you help me
use the bathroom?

596
00:43:10,879 --> 00:43:11,880
Of course.

597
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:17,761
Thank you.

598
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:55,341
Gorgeous flowers.

599
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:57,718
Aren't they?

600
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,137
They're from some
friends of mine.

601
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:02,514
They actually left
just before you arrived.

602
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:05,184
I'm so happy to see you.

603
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:07,353
Hmm.

604
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:09,980
I brought you a book

605
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:12,775
to help you pass the time.

606
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:13,984
Thank you so much.

607
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:16,070
Have you read it?

608
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:19,114
Yes.
Just recently, in fact.

609
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:21,408
It's amazing.
I cried half the time.

610
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:22,993
I'll bring you
some other book then.

611
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:25,621
No, leave it with me,
I'll read it again.

612
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,081
No, I'll bring you
another book.

613
00:44:28,957 --> 00:44:30,542
Well, I have to go.

614
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:32,461
They're expecting me
back at the office.

615
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:35,130
Uh, I'll come
visit again tomorrow.

616
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,549
Thanks for coming.

617
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:55,687
Excuse me.

618
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:58,690
Could you do me
a favor, please?

619
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:00,818
Sure.

620
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:02,194
Could you help me
get to the men's room?

621
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:04,321
I banged my foot
and it really hurts.

622
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:09,159
Thank you so much.

623
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:14,790
Easy, easy.

624
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:17,459
Right here, sir.

625
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:16,221
I did it. I did it.

626
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:22,769
I did good.

627
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:40,120
Vivian...

628
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:43,540
didn't I tell you
that this young man here

629
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:45,459
would not disappoint me?

630
00:50:48,086 --> 00:50:49,838

Yes?

646
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,338
I can't hear you.

647
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:53,146
That's a difficult
situation for anybody.

648
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:55,649
I think Daniel just needs
a little bit more time.

649
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:58,610
Listen, Neil,
give me no excuses.

650
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:00,946
I know he needs time.

651
00:54:00,987 --> 00:54:04,157
I was first to say
that he needs time,

652
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:05,659
but there are limits.

653
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:07,869
Look at him.

654
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:09,913
Look how he's acting
with that suspect.

655
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:12,999
As if they just fucked
for the first time

656
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:14,918
and he doesn't know
how to tell him

657
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,378
that he loves him.

658
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:18,171
Help him. He's your friend.

659
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:21,216
Help him snap out of it.

660
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:22,634
-All right?
-Mm.

661
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:23,760
Have a good day, sir.

662
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:24,970
Thank you, sir.
You too.

663
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:35,146
That suspect was
looking at me funny.

664
00:54:35,188 --> 00:54:36,648
Well, everyone looks at us
funny, Daniel.

665
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:38,525
We're the police.

666
00:54:38,566 --> 00:54:40,527
No, he was looking at me
real funny.

667
00:54:42,904 --> 00:54:44,614
Didn't he look
a little like Liz?

668
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:47,909
Around this area, around

669
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:50,704
this part of his face,
around the chin?

670
00:54:50,745 --> 00:54:54,749
That little punk
looked nothing like Liz. No.

671
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:57,544
You're thrown by the fact
that Liz is slimmer.

672
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:01,172
She should have lost
even more weight by now.

673
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:03,883
Trust me, he looked like her.

674
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:08,763
If they are still alive,
what are they eating?

675
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:12,267
Fish, I guess.
Something like that.

676
00:55:13,101 --> 00:55:14,894
Daniel, hear me out.

677
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:18,148
The weather's already
getting better.

678
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:19,899
They haven't called off
the search, you know that.

679
00:55:19,941 --> 00:55:21,109
And I genuinely believe,

680
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:23,069
no matter how much
you think otherwise,

681
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:24,821
that they're doing
a great job out there.

682
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:26,072
I heard this morning,

683
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:28,867
the head of the rescue mission
is hopeful.

684
00:55:28,908 --> 00:55:30,368
It's just a matter of time,
he said,

685
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:31,661
now that
the boat's been found.

686
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:33,705
He said that today?

687
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:35,081
Around two hours ago.

688
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:43,089
Will you come by
the house tonight?

689
00:55:43,131 --> 00:55:45,091
We'll come by
the house tonight.

690
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:48,178
We brought chocolate cake
for dessert.

691
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:50,347
Chocolate will be banned again
in this house,

692
00:55:50,388 --> 00:55:52,015
you know,
once Liz gets back,
so we thought...

693
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:54,017
Would you like me
to cook your meat
a little more?

694
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:55,101
That's okay.

695
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:56,519
It's a little bloody
for my liking

696
00:55:56,561 --> 00:55:57,771
but it's delicious
all the same.

697
00:55:59,064 --> 00:56:02,525
I like mine almost raw...

698
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:05,779
-but I can cook yours...
-No, no. Sit yourself down.

699
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:07,322
Sit yourself down.
It's superb.

700
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:09,949
I had no idea
what a good cook
you are, Daniel.

701
00:56:09,991 --> 00:56:11,743
-Better even than Liz.
-Hmm.

702
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:14,788
But soon she'll be back

703
00:56:14,829 --> 00:56:17,374
making us that wonderful
roast lamb of hers.

704
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:20,418
Well, you're
a wonderful cook,
too, Martha.

705
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:22,337
Not like Liz.

706
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:24,589
I'll never forget the night
the two of you came over

707
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:26,925
and everything went
completely wrong.

708
00:56:26,966 --> 00:56:29,219
Remember that baked salmon?

709
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:31,096
It came out of the oven
almost charred.

710
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:32,222
Completely dry.

711
00:56:32,263 --> 00:56:34,391
You're wrong about that.
It was wonderful.

712
00:56:34,432 --> 00:56:36,267
It was awful.

713
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:37,769
And I made chocolate mousse
for dessert.

714
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:40,021
Completely forgot that
Liz doesn't eat chocolate.

715
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:41,356
She was so polite about it.

716
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:42,816
She said something funny.

717
00:56:42,857 --> 00:56:44,234
I can't quite remember
what it was she said.

718
00:56:44,275 --> 00:56:45,735
Do you remember what it was?

719
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:56,204
Thank you so much.

720
00:56:58,540 --> 00:56:59,582
What for?

721
00:56:59,624 --> 00:57:00,917
For everything.

722
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:05,046
Both of you. Thank you.

723
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:06,381
There's no need for that.

724
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:10,552
Do you mind
if we watched a video?

725
00:57:12,303 --> 00:57:13,471
One of the old ones.

726
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:20,603
I... I, um...

727
00:57:20,645 --> 00:57:23,857
I don't think
that's a good idea, Daniel.

728
00:57:23,898 --> 00:57:26,025
I think we'll all find that
a little awkward.

729
00:57:26,067 --> 00:57:27,235
Hmm.

730
00:57:28,236 --> 00:57:30,238
Just a little.

731
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,906
-Well--
-A minute, no more.

732
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:34,117
To remember her by.

733
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:36,453
I really don't think
we should.

734
00:57:36,494 --> 00:57:37,745
It won't do you any good,

735
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:40,123
and it'll be pretty strange
for us, too.

736
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:44,961
And you already
showed us those...

737
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:48,965
wonderful photos of Liz
on the boat on her travels.

738
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:50,675
I'd never seen those
photos of her

739
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:52,218
with those reefs
she discovered.

740
00:57:53,678 --> 00:57:54,762
Real impressive.

741
00:57:58,224 --> 00:57:59,225
Okay.

742
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:05,732
Are you sure
you don't want
something else to drink?

743
00:58:05,773 --> 00:58:07,192
Oh, no, I'm fine.

744
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:09,569
I'm fine, too.

745
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:36,513
Those photos at the reefs
were great, weren't they?

746
00:58:36,554 --> 00:58:38,306
Really great.

747
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:49,317
-Okay.
-Hmm.

748
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:51,444
Okay.

749
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:55,073
Well, we can watch
a little of that video.

750
00:58:55,114 --> 00:58:57,867
Thank you.

751
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:15,426
Could you turn
the volume down a little?

752
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:18,096
Sure.

753
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:56,342
Hello?

754
00:59:59,971 --> 01:00:00,972
Yes?

755
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:04,267
Yes?

756
01:00:29,584 --> 01:00:30,627
Who's there?

757
01:00:33,171 --> 01:00:35,632
-Is this
Mr. Daniels?
-Yes.

758
01:00:35,673 --> 01:00:36,841
Did I wake you?

759
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:38,968
No, no,
you didn't wake me.

760
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:40,720
I have some good news
for you, sir.

761
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:43,431
At midnight last night,
we located your wife.

762
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:45,141
Really?

763
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:37,735
Oh, God.
Come here.

764
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:45,076
We were worried about you.

765
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:47,954
I missed you so much.

766
01:01:47,995 --> 01:01:49,789
I missed you both
so much.

767
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:52,208
I can't believe I'm back.

768
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:55,044
That I'm okay.

769
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:56,921
I heard that
Carol is still missing.

770
01:01:58,464 --> 01:02:01,592
Jonathan is in the next room,
but he's in pretty bad shape.

771
01:02:01,634 --> 01:02:04,137
-Daniel.
-Yes, my love?

772
01:02:04,178 --> 01:02:05,638
I want you to take me home.

773
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:06,723
Yes, I will.

774
01:02:07,765 --> 01:02:09,392
Be patient.

775
01:02:09,434 --> 01:02:11,894
You've lost weight,
you're still weak.

776
01:02:14,188 --> 01:02:16,315
What did you
all eat out there
for so long?

777
01:02:17,483 --> 01:02:18,484
Fruit.

778
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:21,696
Animals.

779
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:23,322
Fish.

780
01:02:30,121 --> 01:02:32,248
How's Jonathan?

781
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:34,459
Not great, Daniel.

782
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:37,003
He's lost a lot of blood.

783
01:02:37,044 --> 01:02:38,796
And they told me
his leg's infected

784
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:40,798
and they said
there's a chance
he'll lose it.

785
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:45,386
He'll pull through.

786
01:02:46,512 --> 01:02:49,140
I know it.
He's one tough cookie.

787
01:02:49,182 --> 01:02:51,642
They're operating
on him tomorrow morning.

788
01:02:51,684 --> 01:02:52,977
We'll know more
by 12:00 noon,

789
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:55,188
but no one's optimistic
about his chances.

790
01:02:56,230 --> 01:02:58,983
I heard Liz
is doing well, though.

791
01:02:59,025 --> 01:03:01,360
You can't imagine
how happy I am for her.

792
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:06,532
I knew
this would happen someday.

793
01:03:06,574 --> 01:03:09,577
I don't know why,
but I just knew.

794
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:11,621
When we all
get out of
this hospital, Daniel,

795
01:03:11,662 --> 01:03:14,248
I am not letting him
go out
to sea again.

796
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:16,459
No way. No more research,
no more reefs,

797
01:03:16,501 --> 01:03:17,960
no more diving.
That's it.

798
01:03:18,002 --> 01:03:20,546
That's right.
You put a stop
to it, Sharon.

799
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:24,133
Have you told
the children yet?

800
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:27,220
I don't know
what to tell them.

801
01:03:30,681 --> 01:03:32,683
Anything you need,
just give me a call.

802
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:34,685
Thanks so much.

803
01:03:53,204 --> 01:03:54,372
What was that about?

804
01:03:55,957 --> 01:03:56,999
What's gotten into him?

805
01:03:57,041 --> 01:03:58,668
He's never acted
like that before.

806
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:02,922
Are you hungry?

807
01:04:02,964 --> 01:04:04,674
I can fix you
something to eat.

808
01:04:06,968 --> 01:04:09,971
There's eggs.
I could make you an omelet.

809
01:04:12,765 --> 01:04:15,101
There's also some leftover
meat from the other night.

810
01:04:16,352 --> 01:04:18,271
I've missed eating
something sweet.

811
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:21,858
What is that?

812
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:30,992
Oh, chocolate.
That's what I want.

813
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:41,586
Mmm.

814
01:04:46,257 --> 01:04:48,217
You sure you're all right?

815
01:04:48,259 --> 01:04:50,011
I'm totally sure.
Thank you.

816
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:57,310
And when
the weather turned,

817
01:04:57,351 --> 01:04:59,770
they were only
one day away
from heading home.

818
01:04:59,812 --> 01:05:02,148
Liz kept insisting
they drop anchor somewhere

819
01:05:02,189 --> 01:05:04,483
and wait
for the storm to pass,

820
01:05:04,525 --> 01:05:07,695
and the others insisted
that they set out.

821
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:11,157
Happy to hear
that Liz is back
safe and sound, Daniel.

822
01:05:11,198 --> 01:05:12,533
Thank you, Chief.

823
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:14,827
All right.

824
01:05:14,869 --> 01:05:18,080
She told me
from a certain point on

825
01:05:18,122 --> 01:05:20,374
everything happened
real fast,

826
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:23,252
and all she remembers is
trying to swim to shore.

827
01:05:23,294 --> 01:05:25,838
She also said
how strange it was
that even

828
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:27,506
when her life was in danger,

829
01:05:28,215 --> 01:05:30,217
all she could think about

830
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:31,928
was the instruments,
the equipment,

831
01:05:31,969 --> 01:05:35,473
her files and notes
on the boat that
had been lost.

832
01:05:35,514 --> 01:05:36,974
Ever the professional.

833
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:39,560
And so very brave.

834
01:05:40,478 --> 01:05:41,687
Apart from Liz,

835
01:05:41,729 --> 01:05:43,564
one of her colleagues
survived, too,

836
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:45,441
but he's in
critical condition.

837
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:47,860
He lost a lot of blood

838
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:49,862
and I heard
they amputated his leg.

839
01:05:51,322 --> 01:05:53,240
The other three
were all found dead.

840
01:05:53,282 --> 01:05:54,700
That's awful. Look,

841
01:05:54,742 --> 01:05:56,243
let's not dwell
on unpleasant things.

842
01:05:56,285 --> 01:05:59,413
What's important is that Liz
is well and here with us.

843
01:05:59,997 --> 01:06:00,998
Yes.

844
01:06:04,001 --> 01:06:05,878
Really is amazing
she made it.

845
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,468
Are you sure
this outfit is okay?

846
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:16,097
Of course it is.

847
01:06:16,138 --> 01:06:17,974
Besides,
it's your favorite.

848
01:06:18,015 --> 01:06:20,267
Yes. Yes, it is.

849
01:06:37,368 --> 01:06:38,953
I don't think
these heels
go with it.

850
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:40,705
I'll try a different pair.

851
01:06:42,623 --> 01:06:43,833
Your shoes don't fit?

852
01:06:43,874 --> 01:06:45,084
Oh, they fit.

853
01:06:45,584 --> 01:06:46,669
They're fine.

854
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:49,130
I guess my feet
are a little swollen.

855
01:07:00,808 --> 01:07:01,809
They're fine.

856
01:07:02,309 --> 01:07:03,310
It's fine.

857
01:07:05,104 --> 01:07:06,147
They're on.

858
01:07:07,314 --> 01:07:08,816
I think I heard the doorbell.

859
01:07:16,323 --> 01:07:17,491
Can I have a cigarette?

860
01:07:18,659 --> 01:07:19,702
Sure.

861
01:07:22,204 --> 01:07:23,456
I didn't know
you smoked, Liz.

862
01:07:23,956 --> 01:07:25,249
I don't.

863
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:26,542
I've never smoked.

864
01:07:26,584 --> 01:07:28,669
Can you believe that?
I've never even tried.

865
01:07:33,424 --> 01:07:35,051
I just really felt
like a cigarette.

866
01:07:50,983 --> 01:07:53,069
Should we all go upstairs
to the bedroom?

867
01:07:57,198 --> 01:08:00,117
I think it's best
we don't go up
to the bedroom tonight.

868
01:08:02,203 --> 01:08:05,206
So, what,
we're going to fuck
on the table?

869
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:07,124
Come on, Daniel,
that would be weird.

870
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:10,086
Uh,
we'd better be
getting home soon.

871
01:08:10,127 --> 01:08:13,631
Liz, you must be tired
and I have to be up early.

872
01:08:13,672 --> 01:08:16,801
But everything
was wonderful
tonight, though.

873
01:08:16,842 --> 01:08:18,469
I think you're right.
I think we should leave it

874
01:08:18,511 --> 01:08:19,845
for some other time.

875
01:08:19,887 --> 01:08:20,888
Maybe next time.

876
01:08:23,891 --> 01:08:25,351
I'll clean up the plates.

877
01:08:26,727 --> 01:08:28,187
I just can't stand having
food in front of me

878
01:08:28,229 --> 01:08:30,064
when I've finished eating.

879
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:31,273
I will help.

880
01:08:31,315 --> 01:08:33,317
No, Martha, you sit,
I'll be right back.

881
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:34,610
No, I want to, please.

882
01:08:35,694 --> 01:08:36,695
Thank you.

883
01:08:40,991 --> 01:08:43,160
Oh, I've had far
too much to eat tonight,

884
01:08:43,202 --> 01:08:44,829
and when I've had
far too much to eat,

885
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:47,289
I don't sleep well at all.

886
01:08:54,588 --> 01:08:56,215
Neil, I'm going to
tell you a secret.

887
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:58,342
You are my best friend,

888
01:08:58,384 --> 01:09:00,010
and I want to tell you
a secret.

889
01:09:00,052 --> 01:09:03,430
You are.
Aren't you my best friend?

890
01:09:03,472 --> 01:09:05,224
Of course, Daniel.

891
01:09:06,892 --> 01:09:09,854
That woman isn't Liz.
She's not my wife.

892
01:09:11,939 --> 01:09:13,357
What do you mean?

893
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:15,234
I mean,
she's not really Liz.

894
01:09:15,276 --> 01:09:16,527
I don't know
what's going on,

895
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:18,654
I don't know
what's happened to Liz,

896
01:09:18,696 --> 01:09:21,240
but what I do know
is that she's lying.

897
01:09:21,282 --> 01:09:22,616
She's not really my wife.

898
01:09:22,658 --> 01:09:25,619
Daniel, you've had
a lot to drink tonight.

899
01:09:25,661 --> 01:09:27,663
Just listen to me. Listen.

900
01:09:28,581 --> 01:09:29,832
We were out for a drive

901
01:09:29,874 --> 01:09:31,917
and I told her
to put on my favorite song.

902
01:09:31,959 --> 01:09:33,419
Anyone who's
close to me knows

903
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:35,296
which song
is my favorite song.

904
01:09:36,046 --> 01:09:37,423
Holiday.

905
01:09:37,464 --> 01:09:38,757
Right.

906
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:42,094
But when I asked her
to play that song...

907
01:09:43,345 --> 01:09:44,805
that's not what she played.

908
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:48,100
♪ When there's lightning ♪

909
01:09:48,142 --> 01:09:51,020
♪ You know it always
brings me down ♪

910
01:09:51,061 --> 01:09:52,813
You like that one a lot,
too, though.

911
01:09:53,939 --> 01:09:55,107
Yes, a lot.

912
01:09:55,149 --> 01:09:56,567
But that's not
my favorite song.

913
01:09:57,401 --> 01:09:58,777
Daniel...

914
01:09:58,819 --> 01:10:01,488
you know Liz
has been through
a lot lately.

915
01:10:03,365 --> 01:10:06,118
She found the chocolate cake

916
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:09,121
that you brought over
in the refrigerator
and ate it.

917
01:10:09,163 --> 01:10:10,247
All of it.

918
01:10:10,289 --> 01:10:11,498
Daniel...

919
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:14,627
you mustn't forget Liz
was starving for days.

920
01:10:14,668 --> 01:10:16,086
It doesn't surprise me
she had a little chocolate

921
01:10:16,128 --> 01:10:17,713
now that she's back.

922
01:10:20,549 --> 01:10:23,344
I think it's time.

923
01:10:23,385 --> 01:10:24,845
We should be going.

924
01:10:24,887 --> 01:10:28,098
Um, it's pretty late
and I'm really tired.

925
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:29,600
-Thanks for everything.
-Hmm.

926
01:10:30,809 --> 01:10:33,062
Yeah.
Thank you both so much.

927
01:10:43,405 --> 01:10:44,448
Liz!

928
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:47,910
I have to leave for work.
I'm late.

929
01:10:50,037 --> 01:10:51,997
Can you believe
that the whole time
I was lost

930
01:10:52,039 --> 01:10:53,415
in the middle of nowhere,

931
01:10:54,291 --> 01:10:55,542
cold and hungry,

932
01:10:57,253 --> 01:10:59,213
all I could think
about wasn't

933
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:01,090
the hot meals
I was missing,

934
01:11:01,131 --> 01:11:03,300
or the warm blankets
back home.

935
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:06,303
Or even my dad.

936
01:11:06,345 --> 01:11:07,888
All I could think about...

937
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:09,265
-was your cock.
-Liz.

938
01:11:09,306 --> 01:11:12,017
We could fuck
with you wearing
your uniform.

939
01:11:12,851 --> 01:11:13,936
Or I could wear it.

940
01:11:15,521 --> 01:11:16,730
No, you wear it.

941
01:11:18,023 --> 01:11:19,233
Ow!

942
01:11:23,487 --> 01:11:24,947
Have you lost your mind?

943
01:11:25,656 --> 01:11:27,241
That hurt.

944
01:11:27,283 --> 01:11:28,784
I'm sorry, darling.
I thought you liked
a little club play

945
01:11:28,826 --> 01:11:29,868
when we fuck.

946
01:11:31,453 --> 01:11:33,038
Tonight,
we honor Liz

947
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:36,125
who has advanced
our maritime research

948
01:11:36,166 --> 01:11:37,626
with her passion,

949
01:11:37,668 --> 01:11:39,086
her persistence,

950
01:11:39,128 --> 01:11:40,671
her expertise.

951
01:11:47,177 --> 01:11:50,097
And now I have
a little surprise
for you all.

952
01:11:50,139 --> 01:11:52,725
You could at least
try and look happy for Liz.

953
01:11:52,766 --> 01:11:55,561
It's outrageous,
the way you've been behaving.

954
01:11:55,602 --> 01:11:57,938
You haven't said
a single word to her
all evening.

955
01:11:57,980 --> 01:11:59,356
You've been treating her
very badly.

956
01:11:59,398 --> 01:12:01,191
Safe and sound.

957
01:12:01,233 --> 01:12:03,485
The helicopter pilot
that located

958
01:12:03,527 --> 01:12:05,321
and recovered
Liz and Jonathan.

959
01:12:05,362 --> 01:12:09,450
George, I'm tired.
Could you stop talking?

960
01:12:09,491 --> 01:12:10,659
Snap out of it.

961
01:12:16,749 --> 01:12:18,042
George,

962
01:12:18,083 --> 01:12:19,710
open your eyes

963
01:12:19,752 --> 01:12:22,921
and look clearly
at what's going on
around you.

964
01:12:22,963 --> 01:12:24,465
Thank you
all so very much.

965
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:26,925
We might all be in danger.

966
01:12:26,967 --> 01:12:28,302
The most important
thing to me...

967
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:29,511
What, are you drunk?

968
01:12:29,553 --> 01:12:30,929
...are the people
that I love.

969
01:12:35,267 --> 01:12:37,603
Jonathan,
you should know that
you're in our prayers.

970
01:12:38,395 --> 01:12:40,439
In all of our prayers.

971
01:12:40,481 --> 01:12:43,233
You'll feel better soon.
I know it.

972
01:12:43,275 --> 01:12:45,194
You'll be home with your kids
in no time.

973
01:12:47,279 --> 01:12:49,365
Are you a doctor?

974
01:12:49,406 --> 01:12:52,201
No, Jonathan,
it's me. Liz.

975
01:12:52,242 --> 01:12:53,869
It's Liz, my love.

976
01:12:56,413 --> 01:12:57,956
Can I have some Kool-Aid?

977
01:12:58,665 --> 01:12:59,666
Water...

978
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:01,668
no Kool-Aid.

979
01:13:08,092 --> 01:13:09,593
Sharon,

980
01:13:09,635 --> 01:13:11,887
why don't we
step outside and...

981
01:13:11,929 --> 01:13:13,847
leave these two alone
for a minute.

982
01:13:13,889 --> 01:13:15,224
I'm sure they have a lot
to talk about.

983
01:13:20,437 --> 01:13:21,855
Can I ask you something?

984
01:13:25,692 --> 01:13:28,028
Are you sure...

985
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:30,155
that man dying in there
is really your husband?

986
01:13:30,197 --> 01:13:33,325
Are you sure
that's Jonathan?

987
01:13:41,333 --> 01:13:43,544
If I were you...

988
01:13:43,585 --> 01:13:47,798
I'd try putting a pair
of your real husband's
shoes on him

989
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:50,008
and see if they fit.

990
01:13:50,050 --> 01:13:53,595
And I'd tell your kids
to quit crying because

991
01:13:53,637 --> 01:13:55,264
that man in there
isn't their father.

992
01:13:55,305 --> 01:13:56,765
It's just some guy
that looks like him.

993
01:13:57,349 --> 01:13:58,851
A lot.

994
01:13:58,892 --> 01:14:00,769
But it's not him. And,

995
01:14:00,811 --> 01:14:04,898
whoever did this, Sharon,
has done a really good job.

996
01:14:06,108 --> 01:14:07,818
Almost perfect...

997
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:12,030
but not perfect enough.
Their feet are different.

998
01:14:12,072 --> 01:14:14,199
Their feet are bigger

999
01:14:15,325 --> 01:14:17,828
and softer for some reason.

1000
01:14:19,997 --> 01:14:21,999
And there's
other things, too.
Lots of things.

1001
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:24,501
Sharon...

1002
01:14:25,419 --> 01:14:27,504
she asked me

1003
01:14:27,546 --> 01:14:30,966
to fuck her
in my uniform,
then hit me...

1004
01:14:32,217 --> 01:14:34,803
hard with my club.

1005
01:14:35,762 --> 01:14:36,847
Can you believe that?

1006
01:14:37,347 --> 01:14:38,599
She left a mark.

1007
01:14:42,144 --> 01:14:44,688
We didn't, obviously.
Fuck, I mean.

1008
01:14:47,608 --> 01:14:51,653
You know he's in there
right now. With her.

1009
01:14:51,695 --> 01:14:54,823
And they're laughing at us,
Sharon. That's a fact.

1010
01:14:54,865 --> 01:14:58,076
They're laughing at us.
They're playing us for fools.

1011
01:14:58,118 --> 01:14:59,703
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

1012
01:15:00,370 --> 01:15:01,872
I'd like to transfer

1013
01:15:01,914 --> 01:15:04,625
the... the money I have
in a joint account

1014
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:07,336
I share with my wife
to a personal account, please.

1015
01:15:07,377 --> 01:15:09,379
Okay. Can I see
some form of ID?

1016
01:15:12,841 --> 01:15:14,092
Here you are.

1017
01:15:14,134 --> 01:15:15,219
Thank you.

1018
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:17,054
I see you're
a police officer, huh?

1019
01:15:17,095 --> 01:15:18,847
-Yes, ma'am, I am.
-Okay.

1020
01:15:26,980 --> 01:15:29,107
And did you
want to transfer
the entire balance?

1021
01:15:29,149 --> 01:15:30,901
The entire balance. Yes.

1022
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:39,910
Aren't you going
to eat something?

1023
01:15:41,161 --> 01:15:42,496
I'm not hungry.

1024
01:15:44,164 --> 01:15:45,457
Please, darling, eat.

1025
01:15:46,625 --> 01:15:47,960
I'm not hungry.

1026
01:15:50,212 --> 01:15:51,755
Would you like
something else to eat?

1027
01:15:54,007 --> 01:15:56,760
I'm not hungry.

1028
01:16:11,942 --> 01:16:13,944
Hello? Yes?

1029
01:16:16,655 --> 01:16:17,656
Liz?

1030
01:16:19,575 --> 01:16:21,034
Liz, is that you?

1031
01:16:28,292 --> 01:16:30,711
Speak to me,
please, Liz.

1032
01:16:48,604 --> 01:16:51,648
You took my phone,
give it back.

1033
01:16:51,690 --> 01:16:53,025
Darling, don't start
that again.

1034
01:16:53,066 --> 01:16:54,318
Why would I
take your phone?

1035
01:17:03,368 --> 01:17:05,746
Monty probably
knocked it behind
the couch or something.

1036
01:17:06,663 --> 01:17:08,040
It'll be here somewhere.

1037
01:17:09,374 --> 01:17:11,752
We can look for it
when we're finished eating.

1038
01:17:11,793 --> 01:17:12,794
Liz!

1039
01:17:14,755 --> 01:17:15,797
Liz!

1040
01:17:16,590 --> 01:17:18,800
Give it.

1041
01:17:18,842 --> 01:17:22,262
Listen, I have some news
that'll cheer you up.

1042
01:17:23,889 --> 01:17:25,557
It'll bring
your appetite back too.

1043
01:17:30,395 --> 01:17:31,772
Daniel, I'm pregnant.

1044
01:17:35,108 --> 01:17:37,027
I know it sounds impossible

1045
01:17:37,069 --> 01:17:38,737
but the doctor said it's true.

1046
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:40,656
She can't explain it.

1047
01:17:40,697 --> 01:17:43,784
She said it might be
psychological,

1048
01:17:43,825 --> 01:17:45,327
me never being pregnant.

1049
01:17:47,954 --> 01:17:50,791
Are you excited to find out
if it's a boy or girl?

1050
01:17:52,959 --> 01:17:54,461
I know I am.

1051
01:17:54,503 --> 01:17:55,879
Isn't it wonderful?

1052
01:17:57,798 --> 01:17:59,633
I want you out of the house.

1053
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:01,009
What did you say?

1054
01:18:01,051 --> 01:18:04,554
I want you out
of my house.

1055
01:18:06,139 --> 01:18:07,849
-Why?
-You know why.

1056
01:18:09,267 --> 01:18:11,228
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1057
01:18:16,191 --> 01:18:18,026
I know what's going on.

1058
01:18:19,569 --> 01:18:21,363
I know you're lying to me.

1059
01:18:22,989 --> 01:18:24,825
Leave...

1060
01:18:24,866 --> 01:18:27,786
and I promise
no one will ever
come looking for you.

1061
01:18:27,828 --> 01:18:30,038
But if you don't,
I will have you arrested

1062
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:31,915
and you'll go to jail.
Don't touch me.

1063
01:18:33,667 --> 01:18:35,627
Pack your things

1064
01:18:35,669 --> 01:18:38,380
and get out.
Without any fuss. Tonight.

1065
01:18:42,134 --> 01:18:43,510
I'm not leaving, Daniel.

1066
01:18:45,429 --> 01:18:46,471
This is my home.

1067
01:18:56,523 --> 01:18:58,275
Passenger,
show me your hands.

1068
01:18:59,901 --> 01:19:00,902
Fuck it.

1069
01:19:03,739 --> 01:19:05,407
Turn off the vehicle,
please, miss.

1070
01:19:06,283 --> 01:19:07,284
Shut up.

1071
01:19:08,243 --> 01:19:09,619
Sorry, Officer.

1072
01:19:09,661 --> 01:19:11,329
You ran a red light
and you were speeding, miss.

1073
01:19:11,371 --> 01:19:12,539
I'll need you to step out
of your vehicle.

1074
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:14,666
Yeah, you're right. Shut up.

1075
01:19:14,708 --> 01:19:16,918
I didn't see the red light.

1076
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:18,712
It's all right.
Step out, please, miss.

1077
01:19:25,051 --> 01:19:26,470
Place your hands
on the vehicle.

1078
01:19:30,849 --> 01:19:31,933
Spread your legs.

1079
01:19:38,523 --> 01:19:40,150
What's that in
your pocket, miss?

1080
01:19:40,192 --> 01:19:41,860
It's my cell.

1081
01:19:41,902 --> 01:19:43,153
I want you
to take it out slowly

1082
01:19:43,195 --> 01:19:44,279
and place it on the vehicle.

1083
01:19:52,704 --> 01:19:54,831
Where did you get this phone?
Who gave it to you?

1084
01:19:54,873 --> 01:19:56,500
It's my phone.
I bought it.

1085
01:19:56,541 --> 01:19:57,584
Don't lie to me.

1086
01:19:57,626 --> 01:19:59,085
-What?
-Don't lie to me.

1087
01:19:59,127 --> 01:20:00,212
Do you know
a woman named Liz?

1088
01:20:00,253 --> 01:20:01,671
What? No.
No, that's my phone.

1089
01:20:01,713 --> 01:20:03,298
This phone, miss.
Who gave it to you?

1090
01:20:03,340 --> 01:20:05,050
-This is my phone.
-What?

1091
01:20:05,091 --> 01:20:06,802
-This is my phone.
-Are you out of your mind?

1092
01:20:06,843 --> 01:20:07,886
-That's my phone.
-Put the phone down, man.

1093
01:20:07,928 --> 01:20:09,262
Quiet down, sir.

1094
01:20:09,304 --> 01:20:10,430
You've got no right
looking at her phone.

1095
01:20:10,472 --> 01:20:12,015
Passenger,
remain in the vehicle.

1096
01:20:12,057 --> 01:20:14,142
You'll stop right there
if you know
what's good for you.

1097
01:20:14,184 --> 01:20:15,936
-Daniel, take it easy.
-I said, put the fucking...

1098
01:20:15,977 --> 01:20:18,063
-Daniel,
what the fuck?

1099
01:20:19,147 --> 01:20:20,524
What the fuck!

1100
01:20:20,565 --> 01:20:22,192
Bravo Two to headquarters,
shots fired. Subject down.

1101
01:20:22,234 --> 01:20:24,277
I'm sorry, it was an accident.
Here, give me your hand.

1102
01:20:29,950 --> 01:20:31,326
Daniel, are you shitting me?

1103
01:20:31,368 --> 01:20:32,786
What the fuck are you doing?

1104
01:20:33,370 --> 01:20:34,454
I'm sorry.

1105
01:20:36,998 --> 01:20:38,708
I'm sorry.

1106
01:20:45,465 --> 01:20:47,300
Dr. Evans.
Dr. Evans.

1107
01:20:48,134 --> 01:20:49,636
Hi, Neil.

1108
01:20:49,678 --> 01:20:51,137
Dr. Evans,
how did it go?

1109
01:20:51,179 --> 01:20:53,098
He'll be
on medication
for a few months,

1110
01:20:53,139 --> 01:20:54,641
but it's nothing serious.

1111
01:20:54,683 --> 01:20:56,726
At least
it doesn't seem serious.

1112
01:20:57,936 --> 01:21:00,021
In the simplest
possible terms,

1113
01:21:00,063 --> 01:21:03,108
I'd call it a mild form of
persecutory delusion.

1114
01:21:04,192 --> 01:21:06,319
I can't say what caused it,

1115
01:21:06,361 --> 01:21:08,113
but I think he'll be fine.

1116
01:21:08,154 --> 01:21:09,739
He was perfectly cooperative.

1117
01:21:10,740 --> 01:21:11,908
It'll take some time,

1118
01:21:11,950 --> 01:21:14,035
but he'll get over it
in my opinion.

1119
01:21:14,077 --> 01:21:16,621
Can he carry on working?

1120
01:21:16,663 --> 01:21:20,375
It would be better
if he took some time off
from the force.

1121
01:21:20,417 --> 01:21:24,254
Better for him,
and for everyone here.

1122
01:21:24,296 --> 01:21:26,590
And he's not a danger
to himself?

1123
01:21:27,215 --> 01:21:28,592
Or to others?

1124
01:21:28,633 --> 01:21:31,303
No, he's just
a little confused.

1125
01:21:31,344 --> 01:21:34,139
He poses no real danger
to anyone.

1126
01:21:34,180 --> 01:21:36,433
So long as he
keeps taking
his medication,

1127
01:21:36,474 --> 01:21:37,642
I think he'll be fine.

1128
01:21:40,103 --> 01:21:42,439
He really put the fear
in me, Doctor.

1129
01:21:43,565 --> 01:21:44,774
It was like a madman.

1130
01:21:45,775 --> 01:21:47,193
I got scared.

1131
01:21:47,235 --> 01:21:48,194
I thought he was
going to kill
everyone out there.

1132
01:21:48,236 --> 01:21:49,988
Me included.

1133
01:21:50,030 --> 01:21:51,948
There's nothing
to worry about.

1134
01:22:11,009 --> 01:22:12,552
Daniel,
are you going to eat?

1135
01:22:13,845 --> 01:22:15,639
Just answer me.
Yes or no?

1136
01:22:20,602 --> 01:22:22,187
Why are you
doing this to me?

1137
01:22:24,648 --> 01:22:25,982
You'll starve to death.

1138
01:22:27,359 --> 01:22:28,568
Is that what you want?

1139
01:22:34,366 --> 01:22:35,784
What else can I do?

1140
01:22:37,786 --> 01:22:39,287
I don't know
what else to do.

1141
01:22:44,334 --> 01:22:46,002
Talk to me, please.

1142
01:22:49,005 --> 01:22:50,507
You have to eat something.

1143
01:22:52,467 --> 01:22:54,260
I'll make you
whatever you'd like.

1144
01:22:55,553 --> 01:22:57,389
Just tell me
what you want,
and I'll make it.

1145
01:22:58,431 --> 01:22:59,641
Whatever you want.

1146
01:23:06,231 --> 01:23:07,357
Oh...

1147
01:23:15,490 --> 01:23:18,743
Sweetheart,
I don't know
what to say.

1148
01:23:18,785 --> 01:23:22,747
I feel ashamed
to call that monster
your husband.

1149
01:23:23,790 --> 01:23:25,500
I always knew
that there was

1150
01:23:25,542 --> 01:23:27,293
something not quite
right with him,

1151
01:23:27,335 --> 01:23:28,962
but I always hoped
that maybe...

1152
01:23:31,673 --> 01:23:33,883
Don't you dare
speak about Daniel that way.

1153
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:36,886
He's given me everything.

1154
01:23:36,928 --> 01:23:41,182
He loves me like no one else,
and all you do is judge him.

1155
01:23:41,224 --> 01:23:44,144
Don't you dare
speak badly about him
to me ever again.

1156
01:23:45,812 --> 01:23:46,896
You hear me, Dad?

1157
01:23:49,607 --> 01:23:51,359
Apologize for what you said.

1158
01:23:52,152 --> 01:23:53,778
To me. Now.

1159
01:24:03,663 --> 01:24:05,331
Dad, last night
I had a dream.

1160
01:24:06,875 --> 01:24:10,003
I was lying on that beach
where they found me.

1161
01:24:10,045 --> 01:24:12,797
I don't remember
what I was wearing,

1162
01:24:12,839 --> 01:24:15,050
but it was like
I had been there for years.

1163
01:24:15,091 --> 01:24:16,426
And you were there.

1164
01:24:16,468 --> 01:24:19,179
Daniel was there.
We all were.

1165
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:20,597
Funny thing is,
life in that place

1166
01:24:20,638 --> 01:24:22,015
wasn't like it is here.

1167
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:25,477
It took me
a few days to realize,

1168
01:24:25,518 --> 01:24:27,228
but that place went by
different rules.

1169
01:24:28,605 --> 01:24:30,190
There, dogs were in charge.

1170
01:24:32,942 --> 01:24:35,528
People were animals
and animals were people.

1171
01:24:37,989 --> 01:24:40,492
I must admit, Dad, the dogs
treated us pretty well.

1172
01:24:42,494 --> 01:24:44,913
They gave us food...

1173
01:24:44,954 --> 01:24:47,207
and they bandaged our wounds
after licking them,

1174
01:24:47,957 --> 01:24:50,085
and they never bit us,

1175
01:24:50,126 --> 01:24:52,337
even when we tried
to hurt them.

1176
01:24:52,378 --> 01:24:54,631
And every morning
they gave us chocolate to eat.

1177
01:24:54,672 --> 01:24:57,550
Because dogs mustn't eat
chocolate, you know.

1178
01:24:57,592 --> 01:25:00,178
Lamb, which is
my favorite food

1179
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:01,387
was a rare treat,

1180
01:25:01,429 --> 01:25:04,557
and the dogs mostly
kept that for themselves.

1181
01:25:04,599 --> 01:25:07,519
For the first few days,
I refused to eat

1182
01:25:07,560 --> 01:25:09,270
and I waited
for leftover lamb chop,

1183
01:25:09,312 --> 01:25:11,815
but someone else
always got to it first so...

1184
01:25:13,691 --> 01:25:15,110
eventually, I just ate
the chocolate

1185
01:25:15,151 --> 01:25:16,945
because there was
lots of it around.

1186
01:25:18,071 --> 01:25:20,323
And I didn't like it much

1187
01:25:20,365 --> 01:25:22,617
but it was better than going
hungry and so...

1188
01:25:23,743 --> 01:25:26,246
from then on,
I ate chocolate every day.

1189
01:25:28,248 --> 01:25:30,041
And here's the conclusion
I came to.

1190
01:25:32,043 --> 01:25:34,629
It's better
to eat something

1191
01:25:34,671 --> 01:25:36,965
that's always available
when you're hungry

1192
01:25:37,006 --> 01:25:38,216
than to depend on something

1193
01:25:38,258 --> 01:25:40,218
that runs out early
every morning.

1194
01:25:41,803 --> 01:25:43,138
And I mean every morning.

1195
01:25:47,725 --> 01:25:48,768
Daniel isn't perfect,

1196
01:25:48,810 --> 01:25:50,520
but he's always been
there for me.

1197
01:25:51,229 --> 01:25:52,564
Go up and see him now.

1198
01:25:53,815 --> 01:25:55,275
He'll be so happy
to see you.

1199
01:25:56,317 --> 01:25:57,694
I have things to do.
I got to go.

1200
01:25:57,735 --> 01:26:00,905
Go up.
Just for a minute.
Say hello.

1201
01:26:02,907 --> 01:26:05,285
Sorry, I got to go.
Some other time.

1202
01:26:28,725 --> 01:26:29,726
Hi.

1203
01:26:30,852 --> 01:26:32,187
Oh, hi, my darling.

1204
01:26:32,979 --> 01:26:35,440
I just went to the store.

1205
01:26:35,481 --> 01:26:38,568
I got some wonderful tomatoes
and some beef tenderloin.

1206
01:26:40,361 --> 01:26:43,031
I ran into Tammy and Kate.

1207
01:26:43,072 --> 01:26:45,074
Tammy said they're really
missing you at work.

1208
01:26:50,705 --> 01:26:52,040
I'm hungry.

1209
01:26:53,791 --> 01:26:55,668
Yes, my love.
What can I make for you?

1210
01:26:57,212 --> 01:26:59,088
Want the beef fillet
I just bought,

1211
01:26:59,130 --> 01:27:00,798
or some spaghetti?

1212
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:02,133
There's some salmon
in the freezer.

1213
01:27:02,175 --> 01:27:04,302
Is it fish or meat
you want?

1214
01:27:06,512 --> 01:27:07,847
Meat.

1215
01:27:07,889 --> 01:27:08,932
Wonderful.

1216
01:27:13,811 --> 01:27:15,605
-Sweetheart.
-Hmm?

1217
01:27:18,024 --> 01:27:21,152
I want you to chop
one of your fingers off

1218
01:27:21,194 --> 01:27:25,823
cook it with cauliflower,
and bring it to me to eat.

1219
01:27:25,865 --> 01:27:30,078
Or your thumb maybe,
whatever you think is best.

1220
01:27:30,119 --> 01:27:31,955
That's what I want.
Can you do that for me?

1221
01:29:35,078 --> 01:29:36,621
-Hi, Daniel.
-Hi, Doctor.

1222
01:29:37,246 --> 01:29:38,373
Come on in.

1223
01:29:41,918 --> 01:29:44,921
I think we're doing
much better, Daniel.

1224
01:29:44,962 --> 01:29:47,840
I think the medication is
starting to take effect.

1225
01:29:47,882 --> 01:29:49,175
How are you feeling?

1226
01:29:50,343 --> 01:29:52,512
I'm feeling better, Doctor.

1227
01:29:52,553 --> 01:29:53,763
That's great.

1228
01:29:58,309 --> 01:29:59,977
I just worry sometimes.

1229
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:03,523
What about, Daniel?

1230
01:30:06,484 --> 01:30:08,069
I want to tell you something.

1231
01:30:09,153 --> 01:30:11,489
But first...

1232
01:30:11,531 --> 01:30:16,536
I want you to check no one
is listening in. That...

1233
01:30:16,577 --> 01:30:20,206
she's not at the door
or anywhere in the,
in the house.

1234
01:30:22,291 --> 01:30:24,419
No one's at
the door, Daniel.

1235
01:30:24,460 --> 01:30:25,586
Liz is out.

1236
01:30:26,462 --> 01:30:27,672
What's troubling you?

1237
01:30:32,802 --> 01:30:33,886
That woman...

1238
01:30:35,555 --> 01:30:38,307
who says she's Liz...

1239
01:30:38,349 --> 01:30:42,019
chopped off her
finger last night
and served it to me

1240
01:30:42,770 --> 01:30:43,938
to eat.

1241
01:30:44,730 --> 01:30:47,442
I didn't, of course, eat it.

1242
01:30:48,359 --> 01:30:49,819
The cat did.

1243
01:30:49,861 --> 01:30:51,946
And early this morning,

1244
01:30:51,988 --> 01:30:54,240
I woke up
and came downstairs,

1245
01:30:54,282 --> 01:30:58,411
to find her punching herself
in the face and belly.

1246
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,751
How have you
been sleeping, Daniel?

1247
01:31:07,795 --> 01:31:10,548
Not well, Doctor.

1248
01:31:12,592 --> 01:31:14,051
I worry

1249
01:31:14,093 --> 01:31:17,472
that she'll hurt me, too,
at some point.

1250
01:31:17,513 --> 01:31:18,598
You got to get her
out of here,

1251
01:31:18,639 --> 01:31:19,724
I'm telling you.

1252
01:31:20,892 --> 01:31:23,603
All in good time, Daniel.

1253
01:31:23,644 --> 01:31:26,314
Just be patient, okay?
Trust me.

1254
01:31:27,940 --> 01:31:28,941
Okay.

1255
01:31:30,985 --> 01:31:32,236
All right, Doctor.

1256
01:31:34,572 --> 01:31:36,032
Liz,
have you heard of

1257
01:31:36,073 --> 01:31:38,201
doctor-patient
confidentiality?

1258
01:31:38,784 --> 01:31:39,785
Yes.

1259
01:31:42,121 --> 01:31:43,164
So you
know that

1260
01:31:43,206 --> 01:31:45,124
you can tell me
anything, right?

1261
01:31:46,417 --> 01:31:47,585
Yes, I know.

1262
01:31:51,088 --> 01:31:53,799
Did someone hit you, Liz?

1263
01:31:55,551 --> 01:31:56,969
What happened to you?

1264
01:32:01,933 --> 01:32:03,142
I know you've
just been through

1265
01:32:03,184 --> 01:32:05,228
something terribly tragic.

1266
01:32:07,396 --> 01:32:10,316
And I am truly sorry
about the miscarriage.

1267
01:32:12,693 --> 01:32:15,029
But you have to
speak out, Liz.

1268
01:32:18,908 --> 01:32:21,827
If someone is responsible
for all of this...

1269
01:32:23,371 --> 01:32:25,831
well, then you
really should say so.

1270
01:32:27,083 --> 01:32:28,584
For your own sake.

1271
01:32:34,507 --> 01:32:35,758
He hit me.

1272
01:32:38,219 --> 01:32:39,220
Daniel did.

1273
01:32:42,723 --> 01:32:44,308
But it wasn't his fault.

1274
01:32:47,019 --> 01:32:48,312
I talked back.

1275
01:32:49,814 --> 01:32:50,982
And he's on these pills

1276
01:32:51,023 --> 01:32:53,234
that make him aggressive
from time to time.

1277
01:32:55,111 --> 01:32:56,737
He didn't do it on purpose.

1278
01:33:00,032 --> 01:33:01,325
He really was very happy

1279
01:33:01,367 --> 01:33:02,868
when I told him
I was pregnant.

1280
01:33:06,205 --> 01:33:07,290
And you know Daniel...

1281
01:33:08,165 --> 01:33:09,584
he would never hurt anyone.

1282
01:33:14,088 --> 01:33:15,923
Please don't tell anyone
about this.

1283
01:33:18,301 --> 01:33:19,885
I've already put it
behind me.

1284
01:33:21,387 --> 01:33:22,388
You should, too.

1285
01:33:27,226 --> 01:33:30,062
I'm sorry.
I'm just so tired and

1286
01:33:30,104 --> 01:33:32,732
after everything
that's happened...

1287
01:33:32,773 --> 01:33:36,736
I just can't anymore.
So thank you so much.

1288
01:33:36,777 --> 01:33:38,154
Have a nice day.

1289
01:33:38,195 --> 01:33:39,363
Liz...

1290
01:33:40,406 --> 01:33:41,407
Hi, Dad.

1291
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:44,410
I'm just calling to say that

1292
01:33:44,452 --> 01:33:46,495
I won't be able to
make it today.

1293
01:33:48,247 --> 01:33:50,416
I need to go into the office,
there's...

1294
01:33:51,208 --> 01:33:52,918
a meeting I can't miss.

1295
01:33:54,545 --> 01:33:58,257
Tell Uncle Stanley
I'm so sad not to see him,

1296
01:33:58,299 --> 01:34:00,509
and make sure to take
lots of pictures, okay?

1297
01:34:01,802 --> 01:34:04,013
Oh, Dad, I forgot.

1298
01:34:04,055 --> 01:34:05,181
We're thinking of going away

1299
01:34:05,222 --> 01:34:07,391
for a few days
to get some rest.

1300
01:34:08,893 --> 01:34:11,228
I'm going to take
some time off, and...

1301
01:34:12,313 --> 01:34:16,192
it'll do Daniel good too.
Calm him down.

1302
01:34:16,233 --> 01:34:18,277
So don't come around
for a few days, okay?

1303
01:34:20,988 --> 01:34:23,240
I'm not sure
where we're going yet.

1304
01:34:23,282 --> 01:34:25,826
You know Daniel,
he never can decide.

1305
01:34:25,868 --> 01:34:28,120
But it'll probably be
somewhere remote

1306
01:34:28,162 --> 01:34:30,623
with bad reception,
so I'll let you know

1307
01:34:30,665 --> 01:34:32,541
where we are
when we get there.

1308
01:34:33,584 --> 01:34:34,585
Okay, bye.

1309
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:52,019
It's good to see you're up
and about, my love.

1310
01:35:02,488 --> 01:35:04,573
Yesterday, the doctor said

1311
01:35:04,615 --> 01:35:06,492
we need to up
your medication a little

1312
01:35:07,660 --> 01:35:10,913
and get you outdoors
from time to time.

1313
01:35:10,955 --> 01:35:12,498
We can go for a walk,
if you like.

1314
01:35:13,791 --> 01:35:15,376
No, I don't feel like it.

1315
01:35:16,210 --> 01:35:17,378
Whatever you want.

1316
01:35:17,420 --> 01:35:18,587
I'm hungry.

1317
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:21,799
I'll make you something.

1318
01:35:21,841 --> 01:35:23,509
I'll bring it to you.
You go up.

1319
01:35:25,845 --> 01:35:28,472
I'm not just hungry.

1320
01:35:30,015 --> 01:35:31,684
I'm famished.

1321
01:35:36,355 --> 01:35:38,733
But don't go serving me
any fingers today.

1322
01:35:40,276 --> 01:35:44,238
Your fingers are revolting.

1323
01:35:44,280 --> 01:35:48,200
In fact, I didn't even eat it.
I fed it to Monty instead.

1324
01:35:49,785 --> 01:35:51,996
I need something filling.

1325
01:35:52,037 --> 01:35:54,707
Your entire leg, let's say.

1326
01:35:57,168 --> 01:35:58,169
Or...

1327
01:36:00,296 --> 01:36:01,338
your liver.

1328
01:36:03,591 --> 01:36:06,260
It's full of iron, liver.

1329
01:36:06,302 --> 01:36:09,930
Ultra-nutritious.
That's what they say.

1330
01:36:09,972 --> 01:36:11,974
And that's what
I need to eat today

1331
01:36:12,016 --> 01:36:13,809
because I'm feeling weak.

1332

01:38:45,210 --> 01:38:46,712

1339
01:38:54,178 --> 01:38:55,179
Good.

1340
01:38:56,388 --> 01:38:57,514
Stand up straight.

1341
01:39:05,230 --> 01:39:06,273
Turn around.

1342
01:39:19,787 --> 01:39:20,788
Perfect.

1343
01:39:22,957 --> 01:39:24,249
Step off, please.

1344
01:39:33,926 --> 01:39:35,135
Very good.

1345
01:39:54,113 --> 01:39:55,489
You have 10 minutes this time.

1346
01:39:55,531 --> 01:39:56,949
-Fifteen.
-Ten minutes.

1347
01:39:56,991 --> 01:39:58,784
Not a moment more.
It's the best I can do.

1348
01:39:58,826 --> 01:40:00,577
-Ten minutes is fine.
-Okay, follow me.

1349
01:40:01,203 --> 01:40:02,204
Wait here.

1350
01:40:07,835 --> 01:40:09,795
Do you have some preference,
whether it's man or woman?

1351
01:40:09,837 --> 01:40:10,879
No.

1352
01:40:12,339 --> 01:40:14,550
This one got brought in today.
Gunshot wound.

1353
01:40:15,050 --> 01:40:16,051
That'll do fine.

1354
01:40:36,780 --> 01:40:37,906
Anna, you can come in.

1355
01:40:37,948 --> 01:40:39,366
Harold, wait here, please.

1356
01:40:46,081 --> 01:40:47,791
Nine minutes,
I'll be waiting outside.

1357
01:40:47,833 --> 01:40:49,251
He said 10 minutes.

1358
01:40:52,921 --> 01:40:54,715
Anna, this is it.

1359
01:40:54,757 --> 01:40:56,050
The moment of truth.

1360
01:40:56,091 --> 01:40:58,093
Isn't it wonderful?

1361
01:40:58,135 --> 01:41:00,345
As you heard yourself,
there's not much time.

1362
01:41:00,387 --> 01:41:02,681
Can you imagine
what the final test might be?

1363
01:41:03,724 --> 01:41:04,892
Great.

1364
01:41:04,933 --> 01:41:06,769
And do you think
you can do it?

1365
01:41:06,810 --> 01:41:08,896
I think I can. Yes.

1366
01:41:08,937 --> 01:41:11,231
Actually, I'm sure I can,
Ms. Emily.

1367
01:41:11,273 --> 01:41:13,150
I think so too,
my dear, sweet Anna.

1368
01:41:14,401 --> 01:41:15,402
Go ahead.

1369
01:41:38,217 --> 01:41:39,927
What if you say
the dead boy's name?

1370
01:41:41,053 --> 01:41:42,054
What's his name?

1371
01:41:46,767 --> 01:41:47,768
Martin Lowe.

1372
01:41:56,443 --> 01:41:57,778
Dear Martin Lowe,

1373
01:42:00,322 --> 01:42:02,199
take life from these hands.

1374
01:42:07,621 --> 01:42:08,705
Open your eyes.

1375
01:42:15,254 --> 01:42:16,505
I think he moved.

1376
01:42:17,131 --> 01:42:19,466
His leg, it moved.

1377
01:42:19,508 --> 01:42:20,676
I did it.

1378
01:42:23,053 --> 01:42:25,764
Can I try with
some other corpse?

1379
01:42:25,806 --> 01:42:27,224
Focus, my dear.

1380
01:42:28,058 --> 01:42:29,309
Touch him, if you like.

1381
01:42:29,351 --> 01:42:30,811
That might help.

1382
01:42:30,853 --> 01:42:32,354
I don't want to touch him.

1383
01:42:32,396 --> 01:42:33,772
What is that
supposed to mean?

1384
01:42:33,814 --> 01:42:36,567
I think I'm going to be sick.
Is there...

1385
01:42:36,608 --> 01:42:39,111
any special cream
I could put under my nose
for the stench?

1386
01:42:39,153 --> 01:42:40,362
The smell is awful.

1387
01:42:40,404 --> 01:42:41,655
No, there's no...

1388
01:42:42,531 --> 01:42:44,283
special cream.

1389
01:42:44,324 --> 01:42:47,494
Just try again.
Just calm down
and try again.

1390
01:42:48,912 --> 01:42:50,622
Can you not watch me?

1391
01:42:51,206 --> 01:42:52,207
If that's okay.

1392
01:43:16,356 --> 01:43:18,400
Dear Martin Lowe,

1393
01:43:20,360 --> 01:43:22,029
take life from these hands.

1394
01:43:23,447 --> 01:43:24,740
Open your eyes.

1395
01:43:39,254 --> 01:43:40,756
Anna, that's enough.

1396
01:43:40,797 --> 01:43:42,049
There's no point
pressing on.

1397
01:43:42,090 --> 01:43:43,258
Andrew, let's go.

1398
01:43:45,093 --> 01:43:47,095
Thank you very much, Anna.
Such a shame.

1399
01:43:47,137 --> 01:43:49,056
Ms. Emily, can I try
with some other...?

1400
01:43:49,097 --> 01:43:50,307
A woman maybe?

1401
01:43:50,349 --> 01:43:51,934
Hey, hey.
Thank you very much, Anna.

1402
01:43:51,975 --> 01:43:53,268
Please, get up.

1403
01:43:56,647 --> 01:43:59,191
Sadly, no,
it wasn't.

1404
01:44:01,193 --> 01:44:02,194
Right.

1405
01:44:03,862 --> 01:44:06,365
Yes, we're leaving
the morgue now.

1406
01:44:08,325 --> 01:44:10,202
We thought
we'd head back tomorrow,

1407
01:44:10,244 --> 01:44:11,703
so we're not driving
through the night.

1408
01:44:12,579 --> 01:44:13,580
Yes.

1409
01:44:15,165 --> 01:44:17,042
Yes, we think
that's best, too.

1410
01:44:20,295 --> 01:44:22,256
Yes, she's right here
beside me.

1411
01:44:23,882 --> 01:44:25,133
Yes, she's fine.

1412
01:44:25,717 --> 01:44:26,927
We're both fine.

1413
01:44:28,679 --> 01:44:30,639
Um...

1414
01:44:30,681 --> 01:44:33,517
We have water to last till
tomorrow, it'll be enough.

1415
01:44:33,558 --> 01:44:35,560
It's around a half a gallon.

1416
01:44:37,813 --> 01:44:39,022
All right.

1417
01:44:39,064 --> 01:44:40,607
Thank you. Bye, Aka.

1418
01:44:45,570 --> 01:44:47,114
I know
we're going to find her.

1419
01:44:47,155 --> 01:44:49,491
I'm kind of relieved
that wasn't her.

1420
01:44:49,533 --> 01:44:51,034
I didn't like her face.

1421
01:44:51,076 --> 01:44:52,160
No humility.

1422
01:45:11,471 --> 01:45:14,182
I knew she wasn't the one
we were looking for.

1423
01:45:14,224 --> 01:45:15,767
I just didn't want
to tell you.

1424
01:45:17,936 --> 01:45:18,895
I mean it.

1425
01:45:19,896 --> 01:45:21,273
I had a dream last night.

1426
01:45:22,357 --> 01:45:23,483
I didn't want
to tell you before,

1427
01:45:23,525 --> 01:45:24,651
because I didn't want
to upset you

1428
01:45:24,693 --> 01:45:25,819
but I can tell you
about it now.

1429
01:45:29,114 --> 01:45:32,242
I was in a big,
beautiful rectangular pool.

1430
01:45:32,284 --> 01:45:34,328
The pool had a diving board.

1431
01:45:34,369 --> 01:45:36,079
Anyway, that's not important.
What's important is

1432
01:45:36,121 --> 01:45:37,414
I was stuck
at the bottom of the pool.

1433
01:45:39,124 --> 01:45:40,751
My hair was caught
in the filtration pump

1434
01:45:40,792 --> 01:45:42,044
and I couldn't reach
the surface,

1435
01:45:42,085 --> 01:45:43,670
but for some reason
I could hold my breath

1436
01:45:43,712 --> 01:45:45,005
underwater indefinitely.

1437
01:45:46,506 --> 01:45:48,175
I was getting desperate.

1438
01:45:48,216 --> 01:45:50,385
Convinced I would die
of hunger and thirst

1439
01:45:50,427 --> 01:45:51,762
that no one would realize
what had happened

1440
01:45:51,803 --> 01:45:53,638
before it was too late.

1441
01:45:53,680 --> 01:45:55,182
When suddenly
music started playing

1442
01:45:55,223 --> 01:45:56,516
from the pool speakers.

1443
01:45:57,351 --> 01:45:58,602
A few seconds later,

1444
01:45:58,643 --> 01:46:00,395
two figures launched
themselves into the water.

1445
01:46:01,188 --> 01:46:02,522
It was two women.

1446
01:46:02,564 --> 01:46:04,691
Synchronized swimmers
in spectacular swimsuits

1447
01:46:04,733 --> 01:46:06,568
who had just
started their routine.

1448
01:46:06,610 --> 01:46:08,195
They looked a lot alike.

1449
01:46:08,236 --> 01:46:09,738
They may well have been twins.

1450
01:46:09,780 --> 01:46:11,323
Although I couldn't really
tell you for sure

1451
01:46:11,365 --> 01:46:12,491
because it's
one of those sports

1452
01:46:12,532 --> 01:46:14,701
where everyone wears
identical things

1453
01:46:14,743 --> 01:46:15,786
and they have
identical bodies,

1454
01:46:15,827 --> 01:46:17,204
and so they always
look like twins.

1455
01:46:18,538 --> 01:46:20,332
During one of their
underwater tricks,

1456
01:46:20,374 --> 01:46:22,167
one of the two women
spotted me.

1457
01:46:22,209 --> 01:46:23,335
To her credit,

1458
01:46:23,377 --> 01:46:24,878
she stopped
the routine immediately,

1459
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:26,296
swam down to me,

1460
01:46:26,338 --> 01:46:27,839
drawing a knife
from her swimsuit

1461
01:46:27,881 --> 01:46:30,258
and cutting my hair,
setting me free.

1462
01:46:30,300 --> 01:46:31,718
That's the woman, Andrew.

1463
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:33,804
That's the woman
we're looking for.

1464
01:46:33,845 --> 01:46:35,555
She didn't look
anything like Anna,

1465
01:46:35,597 --> 01:46:37,015
so I knew she wasn't the one.

1466
01:46:42,979 --> 01:46:44,147
You want some water?

1467
01:46:44,898 --> 01:46:46,024
No, thank you.

1468
01:46:47,484 --> 01:46:48,944
I'm hungry.

1469
01:46:48,985 --> 01:46:50,028
Do you want to go out to eat,

1470
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:51,405
or do you want to get
food here?

1471
01:46:51,446 --> 01:46:53,698
I'd rather
not go out.

1472
01:46:53,740 --> 01:46:55,325
I'll call the diner
downstairs.

1473
01:46:56,410 --> 01:46:57,577
I'll go pick it up.

1474
01:47:06,211 --> 01:47:08,797
Hello. I'd like to place
an order for takeout, please.

1475
01:47:08,839 --> 01:47:10,298
What do you have available
right now?

1476
01:47:12,300 --> 01:47:13,301
Burger.

1477
01:47:14,136 --> 01:47:15,429
Grilled cheese sandwich.

1478
01:47:16,888 --> 01:47:18,306
No. No fish.
We don't eat fish.

1479
01:47:18,348 --> 01:47:19,516
And if you want my advice,

1480
01:47:19,558 --> 01:47:21,268
you should never
eat fish either. Not ever.

1481
01:47:21,309 --> 01:47:22,727
Uh... Burger for me.

1482
01:47:22,769 --> 01:47:23,895
Grilled cheese.

1483
01:47:23,937 --> 01:47:26,273
And a grilled cheese, please.

1484
01:47:26,314 --> 01:47:28,066
No, nothing to drink.

1485
01:47:28,108 --> 01:47:29,317
All right, I'll be there soon.

1486
01:47:33,822 --> 01:47:35,157
I'm going to take a shower.

1487
01:47:47,586 --> 01:47:48,587
Emily?

1488
01:49:42,242 --> 01:49:44,286
-Sorry, Andrew.
-Where were you?

1489
01:49:44,327 --> 01:49:45,870
We said we'd leave early.

1490
01:49:45,912 --> 01:49:47,789
I got up early and I went
for a drive to clear my head

1491
01:49:47,831 --> 01:49:49,541
and then I lost track of time
and I realized I was late,

1492
01:49:49,583 --> 01:49:50,959
so I came rushing back.

1493
01:49:51,001 --> 01:49:53,211
Emily, I've been waiting here
for an hour now.

1494
01:49:53,253 --> 01:49:56,423
I call you, you don't answer.
I was worried.

1495
01:49:56,464 --> 01:49:58,550
Well, I'm sorry,
I didn't see my phone.

1496
01:49:58,592 --> 01:50:00,093
Did you check out already?

1497
01:50:00,135 --> 01:50:01,344
What about the invoice?

1498
01:50:01,386 --> 01:50:02,512
I got it.

1499
01:50:02,554 --> 01:50:05,015
Is there any water left?
I'm really thirsty.

1500
01:50:15,483 --> 01:50:17,319
You know,
if you want to go see

1501
01:50:17,360 --> 01:50:20,447
your daughter and
your husband, then just go.

1502
01:50:20,488 --> 01:50:22,407
I won't say anything
to anyone, you know that.

1503
01:50:22,449 --> 01:50:23,450
I know, Andrew.

1504
01:50:27,871 --> 01:50:28,997
But I don't want to see them,

1505
01:50:29,039 --> 01:50:31,333
and if I change my mind,
I will let you know.

1506
01:50:31,374 --> 01:50:32,459
Let's make a move.

1507
01:51:21,007 --> 01:51:22,801
-Hey, buddy.
-Hi, Andrew.

1508
01:51:30,392 --> 01:51:31,726
There you are.

1509
01:51:33,812 --> 01:51:34,813
-Hi.
-Mmm.

1510
01:51:34,854 --> 01:51:36,106
Mmm.

1511
01:51:38,108 --> 01:51:39,693
Are you hungry?

1512
01:51:39,734 --> 01:51:41,653
We already ate, Omi.
Thank you.

1513
01:51:41,695 --> 01:51:42,904
Darling,
look who's here.

1514
01:51:42,946 --> 01:51:44,239
-Get up and say hello.
-Please.

1515
01:51:46,116 --> 01:51:47,701
He was afraid
you wouldn't make it back

1516
01:51:47,742 --> 01:51:48,868
before his bedtime.

1517
01:51:48,910 --> 01:51:50,161
You're late.

1518
01:51:50,203 --> 01:51:52,163
Oh, no, it's my fault.
 I overslept.

1519
01:51:54,833 --> 01:51:56,167
Jack,
finish eating your fruit,

1520
01:51:56,209 --> 01:51:58,002
and then you can show
Emily your hedgehog.

1521
01:51:59,671 --> 01:52:01,423
This new candidate

1522
01:52:01,464 --> 01:52:03,508
I'm excited about.

1523
01:52:03,550 --> 01:52:06,636
She's exactly
what we're looking for.

1524
01:52:06,678 --> 01:52:08,012
Hmm.

1525
01:52:08,054 --> 01:52:10,849
Here's her details
and some cash.

1526
01:52:10,890 --> 01:52:12,600
I booked you a room
at the same motel

1527
01:52:12,642 --> 01:52:13,893
you were at last night.

1528
01:52:15,603 --> 01:52:18,648
Uh, that's enough apple
for you, Jack.

1529
01:52:18,690 --> 01:52:19,983
You don't want to overeat.

1530
01:52:22,986 --> 01:52:24,154
Show me your hedgehog.

1531
01:52:33,621 --> 01:52:35,248
Everything all right
with Emily?

1532
01:52:36,416 --> 01:52:39,419
She's a good one, I think.
Clever and keen.

1533
01:52:40,086 --> 01:52:41,254
I adore her.

1534
01:52:42,464 --> 01:52:44,799
Yes, Emily's all right.

1535
01:52:44,841 --> 01:52:48,011
A little strange sometimes,
but okay.

1536
01:52:49,804 --> 01:52:51,097
I'm quite tired
from the journey,

1537
01:52:51,139 --> 01:52:53,892
but still really horny.

1538
01:52:53,933 --> 01:52:55,977
Do you want to have sex
with me or Aka?

1539
01:52:57,854 --> 01:53:00,190
With you.
It was perfect last time.

1540
01:53:01,983 --> 01:53:04,694
Unless you've got
someone else
scheduled for tonight.

1541
01:53:04,736 --> 01:53:06,279
It was good, wasn't it?

1542
01:53:06,613 --> 01:53:08,156
No.

1543
01:53:08,198 --> 01:53:10,909
There's no one else
scheduled in.

1544
01:53:10,950 --> 01:53:14,704
We both left tonight open
for you and Emily.

1545
01:53:26,716 --> 01:53:28,676
I think Andrew
has fallen for Omi.

1546
01:53:28,718 --> 01:53:29,969
-Really?
-Hmm.

1547
01:53:32,680 --> 01:53:35,266
Last night
when he was sleeping,

1548
01:53:35,308 --> 01:53:36,601
I think he was having
a wet dream.

1549
01:53:36,643 --> 01:53:38,478
It was actually
really funny.

1550
01:53:38,520 --> 01:53:39,938
He kept saying the words

1551
01:53:39,979 --> 01:53:44,150
"belly, together, Omi, feet."

1552
01:53:44,943 --> 01:53:46,444
Over and over again.

1553
01:53:46,486 --> 01:53:49,405
Well, today's his lucky day
because I just got my period,

1554
01:53:49,447 --> 01:53:50,865
so he doesn't have a choice.

1555
01:53:54,786 --> 01:53:56,412
I was nine days late.

1556
01:53:56,454 --> 01:53:58,706
I thought I was pregnant.
I even picked out names.

1557
01:54:00,708 --> 01:54:01,835
That's a shame.

1558
01:54:01,876 --> 01:54:03,670
How is everything
going with the boat?

1559
01:54:03,711 --> 01:54:06,506
The boat's almost ready.
Omi will show you tomorrow.

1560
01:54:06,548 --> 01:54:08,383
Oh, that's wonderful news.

1561
01:54:15,765 --> 01:54:16,766
Susan?

1562
01:54:18,560 --> 01:54:19,561
Susan.

1563
01:54:20,520 --> 01:54:22,021
What's happening?

1564
01:54:22,063 --> 01:54:24,399
It seems you fell asleep,
my dear.

1565
01:54:25,733 --> 01:54:28,236
I'm sorry, Omi.

1566
01:54:28,278 --> 01:54:30,822
I was waiting for Aka,
and she didn't come.

1567
01:54:30,864 --> 01:54:32,198
I fell asleep.

1568
01:54:32,949 --> 01:54:34,450
No matter.

1569
01:54:34,492 --> 01:54:37,453
Tomorrow morning,
you'll be tested,

1570
01:54:37,495 --> 01:54:38,913
and if you're clean,
you can sleep

1571
01:54:38,955 --> 01:54:40,456
with either one of us.

1572
01:54:41,457 --> 01:54:42,458
You should go.

1573
01:54:43,710 --> 01:54:45,086
I swear I didn't have sex

1574
01:54:45,128 --> 01:54:46,796
with anyone
other than you two.

1575
01:54:46,838 --> 01:54:49,507
And whoever said that I did,

1576
01:54:49,549 --> 01:54:50,925
and I know who it was,

1577
01:54:50,967 --> 01:54:53,303
he's only saying that
because he doesn't like me.

1578
01:54:53,803 --> 01:54:54,929
I believe you.

1579
01:54:57,640 --> 01:54:58,683
You should go.

1580
01:55:17,911 --> 01:55:19,829
Hello, Andrew.
Emily.

1581
01:55:24,542 --> 01:55:26,044
Andrew, would you like
to go first?

1582
01:55:27,629 --> 01:55:28,922
No, it's fine.

1583
01:56:06,417 --> 01:56:08,252
Oh, you're so
beautiful, Emily.

1584
01:56:11,506 --> 01:56:13,007
So very beautiful.

1585
01:56:14,300 --> 01:56:15,301
Thank you.

1586
01:56:16,761 --> 01:56:17,971
You are too, Omi.

1587
01:58:14,796 --> 01:58:17,799
Omi was right.
Susan is not contaminated.

1588
01:59:51,350 --> 01:59:53,477
This is the largest room
on the boat.

1589
01:59:53,519 --> 01:59:55,521
It serves as a waiting area

1590
01:59:55,563 --> 01:59:57,690
for those seeking
her blessing.

1591
01:59:57,732 --> 01:59:59,066
It's wonderful.

1592
01:59:59,108 --> 02:00:01,944
Here's where we'll store
her sculpted bust.

1593
02:00:01,986 --> 02:00:05,448
It'll be displayed
only for special occasions

1594
02:00:05,489 --> 02:00:07,700
and for limited
periods of time,

1595
02:00:07,742 --> 02:00:11,412
especially in the summer,
for obvious reasons.

1596
02:00:11,454 --> 02:00:14,123
A young artist will carve
her likeness out of ice,

1597
02:00:14,165 --> 02:00:15,917
free of charge, of course.

1598
02:00:15,958 --> 02:00:17,585
This is her bedroom.

1599
02:00:25,384 --> 02:00:26,510
And those?

1600
02:00:26,552 --> 02:00:27,887
Those are guest rooms

1601
02:00:27,929 --> 02:00:30,056
for when someone can't make it
back to shore

1602
02:00:30,097 --> 02:00:31,349
because of bad weather

1603
02:00:31,390 --> 02:00:33,684
and they have to spend
the night or,

1604
02:00:33,726 --> 02:00:36,354
when she wants someone
or other to stay with her

1605
02:00:36,395 --> 02:00:37,563
-at some point.
-Hmm.

1606
02:00:39,023 --> 02:00:41,984
Ah, this is the prayer room

1607
02:00:42,026 --> 02:00:44,028
where she'll spend
most of her time.

1608
02:00:47,740 --> 02:00:49,116
The boat
is much bigger

1609
02:00:49,158 --> 02:00:51,285
than I thought
it would be.
It's fantastic.

1610
02:00:52,411 --> 02:00:53,996
And the name
is really wonderful.

1611
02:00:54,038 --> 02:00:55,998
Jack doesn't think so.

1612
02:00:56,040 --> 02:00:58,042
He says it doesn't
remind him of water,

1613
02:00:58,084 --> 02:01:00,836
he says it reminds him
of Santa.

1614
02:01:00,878 --> 02:01:03,339
It's time for you
to pack up some water

1615
02:01:03,381 --> 02:01:05,091
and be on your way.

1616
02:01:05,132 --> 02:01:06,300
We'll be going soon.

1617
02:01:17,436 --> 02:01:19,814
That woman over there
keeps staring at me.

1618
02:01:23,025 --> 02:01:25,319
-Do you know her?
-No.

1619
02:01:33,244 --> 02:01:34,745
Excuse me.

1620
02:01:34,787 --> 02:01:36,205
Can I have a moment
of your time?

1621
02:01:36,747 --> 02:01:37,748
Sure.

1622
02:01:38,958 --> 02:01:40,126
My name
is Rebecca King.

1623
02:01:40,167 --> 02:01:42,295
I am 29 years old.

1624
02:01:42,336 --> 02:01:44,880
I majored in literature
and now work in

1625
02:01:44,922 --> 02:01:48,342
the human resources department
of a multinational company.

1626
02:01:48,384 --> 02:01:50,303
But that's not important.

1627
02:01:50,344 --> 02:01:53,306
My sister Ruth,
she's a veterinarian.

1628
02:01:53,347 --> 02:01:56,183
Her clinic is on
Kenneth Avenue, Number 18.

1629
02:01:57,059 --> 02:01:58,978
My sister and I are twins.

1630
02:02:00,646 --> 02:02:04,025
I think my sister is the one
that you are looking for.

1631
02:02:04,066 --> 02:02:06,610
There's no need to waste
any more of your time.

1632
02:02:06,652 --> 02:02:09,196
I swear to you, it's her.

1633
02:02:11,365 --> 02:02:14,535
Um, Ms. King, hi.

1634
02:02:14,577 --> 02:02:17,830
Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Mark Ball.

1635
02:02:17,872 --> 02:02:21,083
This is my wife,
Stephanie Ball.

1636
02:02:22,501 --> 02:02:25,671
We're here
visiting her parents.

1637
02:02:25,713 --> 02:02:27,673
Her mother's not very well,
you see.

1638
02:02:27,715 --> 02:02:31,344
And we are looking
for something actually,

1639
02:02:31,385 --> 02:02:34,722
a nice, spacious,
affordable apartment.

1640
02:02:34,764 --> 02:02:37,141
I can't quite understand
what it is

1641
02:02:37,183 --> 02:02:39,894
-you want from us.
-Listen. Emily?

1642
02:02:39,935 --> 02:02:41,145
Here's Ruth's card.

1643
02:02:41,187 --> 02:02:44,065
On the back is my address
and phone number.

1644
02:02:44,106 --> 02:02:45,274
If you met her, you'd know

1645
02:02:45,316 --> 02:02:47,360
exactly what
I'm talking about.

1646
02:02:48,569 --> 02:02:49,570
Thank you.

1647
02:02:56,243 --> 02:02:58,120
I think we should call
Omi and Aka.

1648
02:02:58,162 --> 02:02:59,413
I don't think
that's necessary.

1649
02:02:59,455 --> 02:03:00,790
She's clearly insane.

1650
02:03:00,831 --> 02:03:02,124
How did she know my name?

1651
02:03:03,834 --> 02:03:05,252
Maybe she heard me

1652
02:03:05,294 --> 02:03:07,797
calling out to you earlier.
I don't know.

1653
02:03:07,838 --> 02:03:11,592
Andrew, that woman and her
twin sister, obviously,

1654
02:03:11,634 --> 02:03:13,469
look a lot like
the woman that I saw

1655
02:03:13,511 --> 02:03:15,429
in that dream
that I was telling you about.

1656
02:03:19,308 --> 02:03:22,311
Let me just remind you, Emily,

1657
02:03:22,353 --> 02:03:24,355
in case you forgot,

1658
02:03:24,397 --> 02:03:27,566
that the woman
we're looking for,

1659
02:03:27,608 --> 02:03:30,277
her twin sister
is supposed to be dead

1660
02:03:30,319 --> 02:03:33,030
and Ms. Rebecca King
was very much alive,

1661
02:03:33,072 --> 02:03:37,785
speaking to us, no less
right here in the flesh.

1662
02:03:37,827 --> 02:03:39,954
I don't know what you saw
when you were asleep,

1663
02:03:39,995 --> 02:03:42,665
but I know what I just saw
wide awake

1664
02:03:42,706 --> 02:03:44,792
and it doesn't deserve
any more of our attention.

1665
02:04:34,049 --> 02:04:35,593
Sweetie, go say hi to Mom.

1666
02:04:47,313 --> 02:04:49,398
Sorry, Joseph. I should've
called sometime to explain.

1667
02:04:49,440 --> 02:04:50,816
It's fine.

1668
02:04:50,858 --> 02:04:52,109
Are you doing okay?

1669
02:04:56,906 --> 02:04:58,949
The little one's
starting to look like you.

1670
02:04:59,950 --> 02:05:01,035
Around here.

1671
02:05:04,038 --> 02:05:05,664
Mom, look at my new shoes.

1672
02:05:05,706 --> 02:05:08,125
-Dad just got them for me.
- -Oh, they're really great.

1673
02:05:09,084 --> 02:05:10,294
I have to go now.

1674
02:05:10,336 --> 02:05:11,754
Stay a while.

1675
02:05:11,795 --> 02:05:15,549
We're going to make an omelet.
You want to eat with us?

1676
02:05:15,591 --> 02:05:16,926
I have to go.
I have an appointment.

1677
02:05:16,967 --> 02:05:18,010
But some other time maybe.

1678
02:05:18,052 --> 02:05:20,679
Please don't go.
I'm begging you.

1679
02:05:20,721 --> 02:05:22,556
Come by tonight.

1680
02:05:22,598 --> 02:05:23,807
You don't have to stay long.

1681
02:05:23,849 --> 02:05:26,060
We can just have
dinner together.

1682
02:05:27,394 --> 02:05:29,188
Come even for a bit.

1683
02:05:29,230 --> 02:05:30,814
An hour, that's all.

1684
02:05:31,690 --> 02:05:33,692
We really miss you.

1685
02:05:33,734 --> 02:05:34,735
I'll see.

1686
02:05:36,278 --> 02:05:38,197
We eat at 8:30.

1687
02:05:38,239 --> 02:05:39,573
Oh, that's a bit late.

1688
02:05:42,451 --> 02:05:43,577
Where are you staying?

1689
02:05:43,619 --> 02:05:44,620
I have to go.

1690
02:05:48,916 --> 02:05:50,834
Vanessa Weber.

1691
02:05:50,876 --> 02:05:53,128
She's 29 years old.

1692
02:05:53,170 --> 02:05:54,547
She's a waitress.

1693
02:05:55,297 --> 02:05:57,174
Twin sister,

1694
02:05:57,216 --> 02:05:59,009
died six years ago
in a car accident.

1695
02:05:59,051 --> 02:06:01,095
They were not
identical twins,

1696
02:06:01,136 --> 02:06:04,390
but I think that still
fulfills the requirement.

1697
02:06:04,431 --> 02:06:05,724
Yes, that's not a problem.

1698
02:06:09,603 --> 02:06:12,523
Who do you think
Jack's biological father is?

1699
02:06:12,565 --> 02:06:14,775
What are you talking about?
Omi, of course.

1700
02:06:14,817 --> 02:06:16,610
I don't think so.
They look nothing alike.

1701
02:06:18,445 --> 02:06:19,613
Maybe he's yours.

1702
02:06:19,655 --> 02:06:20,906
Will you cut the crap?

1703
02:06:23,993 --> 02:06:26,662
So, Vanessa...

1704
02:06:26,704 --> 02:06:29,832
lives with her father.
He's 67 years old.

1705
02:06:29,873 --> 02:06:31,709
Can I ask
what year you were born?

1706
02:06:32,710 --> 02:06:36,005
-1955.
-1955.

1707
02:06:36,046 --> 02:06:37,715
And marital status?

1708
02:06:38,591 --> 02:06:39,800
Separated.

1709
02:06:41,385 --> 02:06:42,553
Any children?

1710
02:06:45,097 --> 02:06:46,890
I had two daughters.

1711
02:06:47,933 --> 02:06:49,268
Had?

1712
02:06:49,310 --> 02:06:51,812
They both died sadly.

1713
02:06:51,854 --> 02:06:53,689
Both of them?

1714
02:06:53,731 --> 02:06:57,067
One in
an automobile accident
a while back,

1715
02:06:57,109 --> 02:07:00,154
the other one three weeks ago.

1716
02:07:00,195 --> 02:07:03,324
Heart attack
just out of the blue.

1717
02:07:04,742 --> 02:07:05,951
If you...

1718
02:07:05,993 --> 02:07:08,537
don't mind my asking
one more question,

1719
02:07:08,579 --> 02:07:11,081
and you don't need to answer
if you don't want to...

1720
02:07:12,082 --> 02:07:14,585
how old were they
when they died?

1721
02:07:15,377 --> 02:07:17,296
One was 26.

1722
02:07:17,338 --> 02:07:19,798
The other one was 32.

1723
02:07:19,840 --> 02:07:21,300
They were twins.

1724
02:07:21,342 --> 02:07:23,302
Yes, we know.

1725
02:07:24,428 --> 02:07:26,096
We won't take up
any more of your time.

1726
02:07:26,138 --> 02:07:27,890
You stay strong, Mr. Weber.

1727
02:07:27,931 --> 02:07:30,351
Thank you for the tea,
and for your cooperation.

1728
02:07:30,392 --> 02:07:32,936
They really were
beautiful, Mr. Weber.

1729
02:07:32,978 --> 02:07:34,855
Tall, slim.

1730
02:07:36,315 --> 02:07:38,525
If you don't mind me asking,
how tall were they?

1731
02:07:40,235 --> 02:07:41,779
About 5'9".

1732
02:07:43,030 --> 02:07:44,323
Such a shame.

1733
02:07:46,492 --> 02:07:49,787
And they look around
130 pounds, too?

1734
02:07:50,829 --> 02:07:52,414
Such a shame.
Thank you very much,

1735
02:07:52,456 --> 02:07:53,624
Mr. Weber, for your time.

1736
02:07:53,666 --> 02:07:54,875
You're welcome.

1737
02:07:54,917 --> 02:07:55,918
Thank you.

1738
02:07:57,503 --> 02:07:59,254
Do we head back today?

1739
02:07:59,296 --> 02:08:01,674
Let's leave tomorrow morning.

1740
02:08:01,715 --> 02:08:03,759
I mean, the room's
already been paid for.

1741
02:08:04,885 --> 02:08:06,720
Unless you prefer to

1742
02:08:06,762 --> 02:08:08,722
head back today
for whatever reason?

1743
02:08:08,764 --> 02:08:10,182
No,
tomorrow morning's fine.

1744
02:08:11,266 --> 02:08:12,518
Plus,
I'm quite tired.

1745
02:08:12,559 --> 02:08:14,144
I think I'm coming down
with something.

1746
02:08:15,562 --> 02:08:18,982
I feel like a hot bath
and an early night.

1747
02:08:19,024 --> 02:08:20,150
Yes, me too.

1748
02:08:24,363 --> 02:08:25,739
I think you have a fever.

1749
02:08:26,865 --> 02:08:28,075
I'll swing by the pharmacy

1750
02:08:28,117 --> 02:08:30,244
to get a thermometer
and some pills for you.

1751
02:08:30,285 --> 02:08:31,620
There's no need.

1752
02:08:31,662 --> 02:08:34,206
No, there is. We have to get
your temperature down.

1753
02:08:34,248 --> 02:08:35,666
Cover up.
I'll be back in five.

1754
02:08:52,641 --> 02:08:53,642
Emily.

1755
02:08:58,230 --> 02:08:59,898
You didn't come over
last night.

1756
02:08:59,940 --> 02:09:01,400
I'm sorry.

1757
02:09:01,442 --> 02:09:04,069
I was working
and we finished late.

1758
02:09:04,111 --> 02:09:06,029
What are you doing here?

1759
02:09:06,071 --> 02:09:09,241
I just, uh, I came
to get some painkillers.

1760
02:09:09,283 --> 02:09:11,994
The little one hurt her foot
in ballet class.

1761
02:09:12,035 --> 02:09:14,163
Nothing serious,
but she's in some pain.

1762
02:09:14,204 --> 02:09:15,664
What happened
to her foot?

1763
02:09:15,706 --> 02:09:17,040
Is it broken? Is it swollen?

1764
02:09:17,082 --> 02:09:18,917
It's just a sprain.

1765
02:09:18,959 --> 02:09:21,336
Yeah. We iced her right away.

1766
02:09:21,378 --> 02:09:23,297
She almost didn't cry.

1767
02:09:23,338 --> 02:09:24,631
You would've been so proud.

1768
02:09:25,924 --> 02:09:27,926
Come see her tonight,
whenever you're done.

1769
02:09:28,343 --> 02:09:29,344
I'll try.

1770
02:09:31,638 --> 02:09:33,390
Let me see.

1771
02:09:34,641 --> 02:09:36,351
You really do have a fever.

1772
02:09:36,393 --> 02:09:39,813
101. But I'm sure
you'll be better by tomorrow.

1773
02:09:39,855 --> 02:09:41,064
I spoke to Aka earlier.

1774
02:09:41,106 --> 02:09:42,232
They were worried,
but I told them

1775
02:09:42,274 --> 02:09:43,567
everything is going just fine.

1776
02:09:44,485 --> 02:09:45,569
Here, drink your water.

1777
02:09:46,945 --> 02:09:48,739
We don't want you catching
pneumonia now, do we?

1778
02:09:50,115 --> 02:09:53,285
Emily, I think you're
making too much of this.

1779
02:09:53,327 --> 02:09:54,620
Try to sleep a little.

1780
02:09:54,661 --> 02:09:56,413
You need your sleep.

1781
02:09:56,455 --> 02:09:57,831
I'll be going
to bed soon, too.

1782
02:09:57,873 --> 02:09:59,291
Very tired today myself.

1783
02:10:21,522 --> 02:10:22,564
Sorry I'm late.

1784
02:10:22,606 --> 02:10:24,233
I couldn't get here
any earlier.

1785
02:10:24,274 --> 02:10:25,442
Did she go to bed already?

1786
02:10:25,484 --> 02:10:27,569
Yeah, a while ago.

1787
02:10:27,611 --> 02:10:29,488
She was really looking forward
to seeing you.

1788
02:10:31,365 --> 02:10:32,366
Come in.

1789
02:10:33,450 --> 02:10:34,660
I can't stay long.

1790
02:10:37,579 --> 02:10:38,831
How's her foot?

1791
02:10:39,998 --> 02:10:41,208
It's fine.

1792
02:10:42,251 --> 02:10:43,585
Still hurts a little, I think,

1793
02:10:43,627 --> 02:10:45,587
but she'll be all better
soon enough.

1794
02:10:49,091 --> 02:10:50,259
You hungry?

1795
02:10:51,051 --> 02:10:52,094
No.

1796
02:10:52,135 --> 02:10:53,428
Would you like a drink?

1797
02:10:54,054 --> 02:10:55,472
A cocktail, maybe?

1798
02:10:57,057 --> 02:10:58,642
I came up with one myself.

1799
02:10:58,684 --> 02:11:01,937
I drink it every night
before I go to bed.

1800
02:11:01,979 --> 02:11:06,608
Grand Marnier, whiskey,
and two drops of Angostura.

1801
02:11:06,650 --> 02:11:08,277
It's like an Old Fashioned,

1802
02:11:09,069 --> 02:11:10,404
only it's not.

1803
02:11:11,864 --> 02:11:13,782
I call it Emily's Forehead.

1804
02:11:20,330 --> 02:11:21,582
Wait.

1805
02:11:21,623 --> 02:11:24,793
Oh, uh...

1806
02:11:33,719 --> 02:11:35,929
How's everything
at the office?

1807
02:11:35,971 --> 02:11:37,347
Did you get that promotion?

1808
02:11:38,223 --> 02:11:40,183
Yeah. Um...

1809
02:11:40,225 --> 02:11:41,351
A year ago.

1810
02:11:41,935 --> 02:11:43,353
Finally got it.

1811
02:11:44,062 --> 02:11:45,898
More money, same hours.

1812
02:11:46,940 --> 02:11:49,276
Slightly bigger office.

1813
02:11:49,318 --> 02:11:50,819
It's pretty good.

1814
02:11:52,654 --> 02:11:53,947
It's all good.

1815
02:12:07,377 --> 02:12:08,503
Hey, Em,

1816
02:12:10,130 --> 02:12:11,548
did you know, um,

1817
02:12:11,590 --> 02:12:14,760
your forehead goes perfectly
with a little salmon?

1818
02:12:17,471 --> 02:12:19,014
Shall I bring you some?

1819
02:12:20,891 --> 02:12:22,601
I don't eat fish, Joseph.

1820
02:12:26,063 --> 02:12:27,064
Right.

1821
02:12:30,567 --> 02:12:31,568
So...

1822
02:12:32,694 --> 02:12:35,447
are you seeing someone,

1823
02:12:35,489 --> 02:12:36,615
is there someone else?

1824
02:12:37,574 --> 02:12:39,076
No, there's just me.

1825
02:12:41,995 --> 02:12:43,872
And you didn't say
where you're staying.

1826
02:12:45,999 --> 02:12:47,417
I have to go.

1827
02:12:50,379 --> 02:12:52,381
I'm sorry, okay?

1828
02:12:52,422 --> 02:12:54,466
I won't ask
any more questions,

1829
02:12:55,425 --> 02:12:57,177
just stay a while longer.

1830
02:12:57,928 --> 02:13:00,222
One more drink, hmm?

1831
02:13:11,274 --> 02:13:13,235
Something feels
different with...

1832
02:13:14,987 --> 02:13:17,489
Was that picture there before?

1833
02:13:17,531 --> 02:13:18,865
I haven't touched a thing.

1834
02:13:18,907 --> 02:13:21,034
Everything's
just as you left it.

1835
02:16:03,155 --> 02:16:04,156
Get in.

1836
02:16:32,017 --> 02:16:33,435
Emily,

1837
02:16:33,476 --> 02:16:35,353
I want you to know that
there's a chance those

1838
02:16:35,395 --> 02:16:38,773
contaminating fluids will be
expelled with your sweat.

1839
02:16:38,815 --> 02:16:40,358
It's been known to happen.

1840
02:16:41,359 --> 02:16:43,153
I'm hopeful.

1841
02:16:43,195 --> 02:16:45,238
I need you to be hopeful, too.

1842
02:16:45,280 --> 02:16:47,782
We'll raise the temperature
as high as it will go.

1843
02:16:49,201 --> 02:16:50,202
We'll give it our best shot.

1844
02:18:37,767 --> 02:18:39,394
How unfortunate.

1845
02:18:39,436 --> 02:18:40,979
Still contaminated.

1846
02:18:42,647 --> 02:18:44,774
It's such a shame,
all this.

1847
02:18:44,816 --> 02:18:47,736
You shouldn't have let him
defile you, Emily.

1848
02:18:47,777 --> 02:18:50,530
Here's something from
both of us to tide you over

1849
02:18:51,281 --> 02:18:52,324
until you...

1850
02:18:53,450 --> 02:18:55,035
decide what to do.

1851
02:18:56,411 --> 02:18:57,912
We're going to miss you.

1852
02:18:58,747 --> 02:19:00,248
I'm sorry.

1853
02:19:00,290 --> 02:19:02,751
There's no need
to apologize to us.

1854
02:19:02,792 --> 02:19:04,711
The only person you've hurt
is yourself.

1855
02:19:04,753 --> 02:19:06,713
You're the one
that's contaminated.

1856
02:19:06,755 --> 02:19:08,757
I disappointed you.

1857
02:19:08,798 --> 02:19:11,176
And I don't know
how it happened or why.

1858
02:19:11,217 --> 02:19:12,344
Emily,

1859
02:19:12,385 --> 02:19:14,471
maybe all this happened
for a reason.

1860
02:19:14,512 --> 02:19:15,722
Maybe it's for the best.

1861
02:19:15,764 --> 02:19:18,058
Not everyone's cut out
for everything.

1862
02:19:18,099 --> 02:19:20,060
Maybe you came into this world
to raise a daughter

1863
02:19:20,101 --> 02:19:21,311
and live in a house
with a husband.

1864
02:19:21,353 --> 02:19:23,688
-It's fine. It's no bad thing.
-No. No.

1865
02:19:23,730 --> 02:19:25,023
It's fine.

1866
02:19:25,065 --> 02:19:26,941
I'm very thirsty.
Can I have some water, please?

1867
02:19:28,318 --> 02:19:29,819
Take care, Emily.

1868
02:19:30,236 --> 02:19:31,988
Be well.

1869
02:19:32,030 --> 02:19:35,408
We'll miss you very,
very much.

1870
02:19:35,450 --> 02:19:36,868
No. No, no.

1871
02:19:47,295 --> 02:19:48,755
I have an idea.

1872
02:19:52,717 --> 02:19:54,094
If I sweat some more,

1873
02:19:54,135 --> 02:19:55,470
then my body
will cleanse itself

1874
02:19:55,512 --> 02:19:57,555
and I won't be
contaminated anymore.

1875
02:20:00,558 --> 02:20:01,935
I'm already sweating.

1876
02:20:04,938 --> 02:20:05,939
Aka!

1877
02:20:06,940 --> 02:20:08,650
Come lick me!

1878
02:20:08,691 --> 02:20:10,777
Omi, I'm not
contaminated anymore!

1879
02:20:10,819 --> 02:20:12,529
I'm not kidding! Honest!

1880
02:20:57,824 --> 02:20:58,950
When we were younger

1881
02:20:58,992 --> 02:21:01,619
I was more headstrong,
more mischievous

1882
02:21:01,661 --> 02:21:04,664
and Ruth was more quiet
and conscientious.

1883
02:21:05,832 --> 02:21:07,959
One night when we were both
at home alone,

1884
02:21:08,001 --> 02:21:10,753
our parents had left town
for three days,

1885
02:21:10,795 --> 02:21:13,339
I had this idea to have
a couple of girlfriends over.

1886
02:21:16,301 --> 02:21:19,929
Once we drank almost every
drop of alcohol in the house,

1887
02:21:19,971 --> 02:21:22,765
I convinced them
to go skinny-dipping with me.

1888
02:21:22,807 --> 02:21:24,017
Ruth was the only one

1889
02:21:24,058 --> 02:21:26,227
that hadn't had
anything to drink.

1890
02:21:26,269 --> 02:21:28,563
She said that the pool
had been drained

1891
02:21:28,605 --> 02:21:30,231
and that it was cold out.

1892
02:21:31,274 --> 02:21:33,318
But I pushed her aside,

1893
02:21:33,359 --> 02:21:34,986
took off all my clothes,

1894
02:21:35,028 --> 02:21:37,822
ran to the edge of
the empty pool and dove in.

1895
02:21:41,743 --> 02:21:44,621
My head hit
the bottom of the pool hard.

1896
02:21:45,997 --> 02:21:48,166
All I remember
is the screams of the others

1897
02:21:48,208 --> 02:21:50,376
and my blood
going down into the drain

1898
02:21:50,418 --> 02:21:52,337
before losing consciousness.

1899
02:21:52,378 --> 02:21:56,925
When I came to, I found myself
inside the house.

1900
02:21:56,966 --> 02:21:58,676
Ruth was sitting beside me.

1901
02:21:59,219 --> 02:22:01,387
I got up.

1902
02:22:01,429 --> 02:22:03,306
My back hurt a little.

1903
02:22:03,348 --> 02:22:04,807
I went to the bathroom.

1904
02:22:05,350 --> 02:22:07,185
I was thirsty.

1905
02:22:07,227 --> 02:22:10,855
When I looked at my face
in the mirror, I saw that

1906
02:22:10,897 --> 02:22:12,482
there wasn't even a scratch.

1907
02:22:14,692 --> 02:22:15,777
And then a few seconds later,

1908
02:22:15,818 --> 02:22:18,446
I heard Ruth's voice,
she said,

1909
02:22:18,488 --> 02:22:20,615
"You were very lucky.
You could have died."

1910
02:22:21,366 --> 02:22:23,368
And after that...

1911
02:22:23,409 --> 02:22:24,619
"We need to get
the house cleaned up

1912
02:22:24,661 --> 02:22:26,496
"because Mom and Dad
will be home soon."

1913
02:22:27,372 --> 02:22:29,332
Of course, we never told them

1914
02:22:29,374 --> 02:22:31,167
anything about it
when they got back

1915
02:22:31,209 --> 02:22:32,460
and we didn't speak of

1916
02:22:32,502 --> 02:22:34,337
what happened that night
ever again.

1917
02:22:36,130 --> 02:22:37,632
Can I get you another drink?

1918
02:22:37,674 --> 02:22:39,217
No, I'm fine, thanks.

1919
02:22:41,177 --> 02:22:43,179
You have to go see her, Emily.

1920
02:22:45,098 --> 02:22:46,307
Let's say everything
you're telling me

1921
02:22:46,349 --> 02:22:47,392
is the truth.

1922
02:22:48,726 --> 02:22:50,353
There's still
one major problem.

1923
02:22:50,395 --> 02:22:52,939
I know. I know.

1924
02:22:52,981 --> 02:22:54,524
If all the conditions
are to be met,

1925
02:22:54,566 --> 02:22:57,402
then I ought to be dead.

1926
02:22:57,443 --> 02:22:58,653
That's what you mean, right?

1927
02:23:00,613 --> 02:23:01,906
That's what I'm telling you.

1928
02:23:02,949 --> 02:23:04,492
I really ought to be dead.

1929
02:23:33,354 --> 02:23:34,355
Hey!

1930
02:23:36,482 --> 02:23:38,693
Come here. Stay. Stay.

1931
02:23:39,110 --> 02:23:40,111
Come here.

1932
02:23:45,116 --> 02:23:46,117
Come on.

1933
02:23:46,951 --> 02:23:47,952
Come on.

1934
02:24:01,549 --> 02:24:03,426
Hi. What happened?

1935
02:24:04,761 --> 02:24:06,929
We were out for a walk and...

1936
02:24:06,971 --> 02:24:08,973
two strays attacked her.

1937
02:24:10,224 --> 02:24:11,893
She didn't even have time
to react.

1938
02:24:12,810 --> 02:24:14,020
Come on back.

1939
02:24:21,152 --> 02:24:22,445
How old is she?

1940
02:24:23,363 --> 02:24:24,364
Five.

1941
02:24:25,448 --> 02:24:27,200
She looks older than five.

1942
02:24:27,241 --> 02:24:28,451
I mean six.

1943
02:24:28,493 --> 02:24:29,994
Sorry, I'm really shaken up.

1944
02:24:32,789 --> 02:24:34,165
And what's her name?

1945
02:24:35,375 --> 02:24:36,376
Linda.

1946
02:24:39,253 --> 02:24:41,506
Who's a brave girl, Linda?

1947
02:24:42,256 --> 02:24:43,800
Who's a brave girl?

1948
02:24:44,676 --> 02:24:46,719
This dog is like my family.

1949
02:24:46,761 --> 02:24:47,929
She's all I have.

1950
02:24:49,138 --> 02:24:50,431
I'm not sure
if you can relate.

1951
02:24:52,600 --> 02:24:54,227
If you don't mind my asking,
are you married?

1952
02:24:54,268 --> 02:24:55,520
Do you have children?

1953
02:24:55,561 --> 02:24:56,688
No.

1954
02:24:56,729 --> 02:24:57,897
No children.

1955
02:24:58,648 --> 02:25:00,400
Her wound goes deep.

1956
02:25:00,441 --> 02:25:02,735
Those dogs that attacked her
must have been vicious.

1957
02:25:02,777 --> 02:25:03,903
They really were.

1958
02:25:05,571 --> 02:25:06,989
Is she on any medication?

1959
02:25:07,031 --> 02:25:08,658
Does she have
any other health issues?

1960
02:25:09,200 --> 02:25:10,201
No.

1961
02:25:13,162 --> 02:25:15,623
So this is what you use
to weigh the animals?

1962
02:25:15,665 --> 02:25:17,750
Yes.

1963
02:25:17,792 --> 02:25:20,878
Twice daily with food,
and this is for the pain.

1964
02:25:22,714 --> 02:25:25,133
I don't know how to thank you.

1965
02:25:25,174 --> 02:25:27,051
I just hope
everything turns out okay.

1966
02:25:43,234 --> 02:25:44,235
Go.

1967
02:26:03,171 --> 02:26:04,714
What are you doing here?

1968
02:26:04,756 --> 02:26:06,424
Have you been following me?

1969
02:26:06,466 --> 02:26:07,884
Have you completely
lost your mind?

1970
02:26:07,925 --> 02:26:09,552
Emily, I'm sorry about
what happened the other night.

1971
02:26:09,594 --> 02:26:12,096
Please, Joseph, just leave.
I never want to see you.

1972
02:26:12,138 --> 02:26:14,682
I came here to apologize.

1973
02:26:14,724 --> 02:26:16,350
We both had a lot to drink.

1974
02:26:17,351 --> 02:26:18,853
I really missed you.

1975
02:26:19,771 --> 02:26:21,063
Please, just...

1976
02:26:21,105 --> 02:26:22,774
just come say hi
to the little one.

1977
02:26:23,941 --> 02:26:25,318
You brought the little one?

1978
02:26:28,404 --> 02:26:29,405
Okay, fine.

1979
02:26:29,906 --> 02:26:31,449
Let's go.

1980
02:26:36,370 --> 02:26:37,789
Hi, darling.

1981
02:26:38,581 --> 02:26:40,666
Hi, I'm so happy to see you.

1982
02:26:43,085 --> 02:26:45,004
I have some wonderful news.

1983
02:26:45,046 --> 02:26:47,381
Do you remember the woman
that I was looking for?

1984
02:26:47,924 --> 02:26:49,509
I found her.

1985
02:26:49,550 --> 02:26:50,802
Mommy found her.

1986
02:26:52,053 --> 02:26:53,054
How's your foot?

1987
02:26:53,805 --> 02:26:54,972
My foot?

1988
02:26:55,807 --> 02:26:57,600
It's fine.

1989
02:26:58,643 --> 02:27:00,478
That's good to hear.

1990
02:27:00,520 --> 02:27:03,022
Now, do you know
how much of your body

1991
02:27:03,064 --> 02:27:04,857
is actually water?

1992
02:27:06,442 --> 02:27:08,820
Around 70% water.

1993
02:27:08,861 --> 02:27:10,071
Isn't that amazing?

1994
02:27:11,072 --> 02:27:12,406
And what about a potato?

1995
02:27:13,449 --> 02:27:15,743
76%.

1996
02:27:15,785 --> 02:27:19,580
And a bell pepper
is 93.4% water.

1997
02:27:21,916 --> 02:27:23,876
And what about a man's sperm?

1998
02:27:25,461 --> 02:27:27,255
Why don't I just tell you?

1999
02:27:27,296 --> 02:27:29,340
It's around 90% water.

2000
02:27:29,382 --> 02:27:31,133
And that's why...

2001
02:27:31,175 --> 02:27:32,802
as your mother,

2002
02:27:32,844 --> 02:27:35,388
I'd like to give you
a piece of advice.

2003
02:27:35,429 --> 02:27:38,516
And I want you to promise me
that you'll follow it.

2004
02:27:38,558 --> 02:27:43,521
I want you to stay as far away
from Daddy as possible.

2005
02:27:44,647 --> 02:27:47,149
He's contaminated, sadly.

2006
02:27:47,191 --> 02:27:50,278
His sweat, his sperm,

2007
02:27:50,319 --> 02:27:52,405
his genitals,

2008
02:27:52,446 --> 02:27:56,742
all the water that's inside
of him is contaminated.

2009
02:27:56,784 --> 02:27:59,287
And I don't want him
contaminating you, too.

2010
02:28:15,678 --> 02:28:16,888
Hello?

2011
02:28:16,929 --> 02:28:17,930
Emily?

2012
02:28:19,307 --> 02:28:20,933
-Yes?
-Hello.

2013
02:28:20,975 --> 02:28:23,060
I heard you met Ruth.
I'm so glad.

2014
02:28:23,102 --> 02:28:24,520
Listen, Emily,
I'm calling because

2015
02:28:24,562 --> 02:28:27,231
I wanted to give you
some really good news.

2016
02:28:27,273 --> 02:28:29,525
Remember that problem of ours?

2017
02:28:29,567 --> 02:28:30,610
It's all been sorted out.

2018
02:28:33,279 --> 02:28:34,697
Emily, are you still there?

2019
02:28:34,739 --> 02:28:35,740
Yes.

2020
02:28:36,991 --> 02:28:39,493
How has it been
sorted out exactly?

2021
02:29:00,806 --> 02:29:02,433
Emily, welcome.

2022
02:29:02,475 --> 02:29:04,644
Did you find it okay?
I hope it wasn't any trouble.

2023
02:29:04,685 --> 02:29:05,686
No trouble.

2024
02:29:06,020 --> 02:29:06,979
Come in.

2025
02:29:10,441 --> 02:29:12,109
Would you like
some tea?

2026
02:29:12,151 --> 02:29:13,319
No, thank you.

2027
02:29:15,154 --> 02:29:17,782
I'm all ears, Rebecca.

2028
02:29:17,823 --> 02:29:19,325
Just two more minutes
and you'll know

2029
02:29:19,367 --> 02:29:21,243
exactly how it's all
been sorted out.

2030
02:29:22,453 --> 02:29:23,955
At least try
one of the cookies.

2031
02:29:23,996 --> 02:29:25,122
They're still warm.

2032
02:30:09,542 --> 02:30:11,377
Hi. Remember me?

2033
02:30:11,419 --> 02:30:13,295
I came to you the other day
with an injured dog.

2034
02:30:13,337 --> 02:30:15,673
-Of course, I remember you.
-Her name was Mary.

2035
02:30:15,715 --> 02:30:16,716
I thought it was Linda.

2036
02:30:17,633 --> 02:30:18,801
I call her Mary.

2037
02:30:18,843 --> 02:30:20,344
My husband calls her Linda.

2038
02:30:21,929 --> 02:30:23,014
I'm sorry
to show up unannounced.

2039
02:30:23,055 --> 02:30:24,932
I'm just leaving town shortly

2040
02:30:24,974 --> 02:30:26,976
and I wanted to give you
a gift before I go

2041
02:30:27,018 --> 02:30:29,687
just to thank you for
everything you did for Mary.

2042
02:30:29,729 --> 02:30:30,813
She's fine now.

2043
02:30:30,855 --> 02:30:33,149
I'm so glad. Thank you.

2044
02:30:33,190 --> 02:30:34,525
You really shouldn't have.

2045
02:30:40,698 --> 02:30:42,033
Would you like to come in?

2046
02:30:43,284 --> 02:30:45,369
I don't know
if you wear scarves

2047
02:30:45,411 --> 02:30:47,246
but I picked this one out
because it's silk

2048
02:30:47,288 --> 02:30:49,415
and it has various
animals on it,

2049
02:30:49,457 --> 02:30:51,459
you know,
like your profession.

2050
02:30:52,793 --> 02:30:54,253
I love scarves.

2051
02:30:54,295 --> 02:30:55,588
Thank you so much.

2052
02:30:58,007 --> 02:31:00,634
I'm going to get that coffee.
It must be ready by now.

2053
02:31:15,858 --> 02:31:17,109
Oh, thank you so much.

2054
02:31:23,115 --> 02:31:24,241
Will you do me a favor?

2055
02:31:24,283 --> 02:31:26,744
Will you just try
this scarf on?

2056
02:31:26,786 --> 02:31:28,454
It took me ages
to pick it out.

2057
02:31:28,496 --> 02:31:30,081
There were actually
four that I liked

2058
02:31:30,122 --> 02:31:32,374
and I'm just curious to see
if I made the right choice.

2059
02:31:32,416 --> 02:31:33,626
Wow.

2060
02:31:33,667 --> 02:31:35,920
It's beautiful. I love it.

2061
02:31:37,463 --> 02:31:38,589
I don't think
it really goes with

2062
02:31:38,631 --> 02:31:39,882
what I'm wearing today though.

2063
02:31:39,924 --> 02:31:41,801
Oh, I think it goes perfectly.

2064
02:31:42,635 --> 02:31:44,136
Do you mind if I just...?

2065
02:31:45,221 --> 02:31:47,139
Just to see
how it looks on you.

2066
02:31:48,140 --> 02:31:49,141
Okay.

2067
02:31:57,858 --> 02:31:59,693
Ah! Ow.

2068
02:32:00,611 --> 02:32:02,738
What the heck was that?

2069
02:33:29,366 --> 02:33:30,367
There he is.

2070
02:33:46,800 --> 02:33:48,052
Ruth, wake up.

2071
02:33:49,386 --> 02:33:50,387
Wake up.

2072
02:33:52,932 --> 02:33:53,933
Ruth.

2073
02:33:54,975 --> 02:33:56,227
Put your hand on him.

2074
02:33:57,144 --> 02:33:58,145
Touch him.

2075
02:34:03,400 --> 02:34:06,278
Say, "Take life from my hands,
and open your eyes."

2076
02:34:07,571 --> 02:34:09,865
Say it, Ruth. Ruth, wake up.

2077
02:34:09,907 --> 02:34:12,076
Wake up. Please wake up.

2078
02:34:16,163 --> 02:34:17,164
Ruth.

2079
02:34:17,957 --> 02:34:19,667
Put your hand on him.

2080
02:34:22,461 --> 02:34:23,462
Touch him.

2081
02:34:33,722 --> 02:34:35,057
What is his name?

2082
02:34:37,810 --> 02:34:39,687
I told you his name.
Touch him.

2083
02:34:41,730 --> 02:34:42,731
Say it.

2084
02:34:45,609 --> 02:34:47,569
Say his fucking name, Ruth!

2085
02:34:49,530 --> 02:34:50,531
Say it.
