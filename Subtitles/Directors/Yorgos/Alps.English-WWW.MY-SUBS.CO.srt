1
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,994
What's the problem?

2
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:43,873
You know what the problem is.

3
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:47,001
It's great. It's got rhythm.

4
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:50,337
I don't like it.

5
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,092
I can't focus.

6
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,890
Why can't we use a pop song?

7
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,395
You're not ready for pop.

8
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:16,447
If you want to know what the problem is,
I'll tell you what the problem is.

9
00:03:17,323 --> 00:03:20,034
The problem is that you don't trust me.

10
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:26,498
The problem is you think
I'm not ready for pop, when I am.

11
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:30,878
Raise your voice at me again,

12
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,673
and I'll take a club
and crack your head open.

13
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:38,260
And then I'll break your arms
and your legs.

14
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:42,348
And then you really won't be able
to perform to pop.

15
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:46,477
In fact, you won't be able
to perform to anything.

16
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:51,732
Not rock, not fox-trot, not Latin,
not anything.

17
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:55,027
I know damn well
when someone's ready for pop.

18
00:04:03,953 --> 00:04:05,788
I'm sorry.

19
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:14,213
You know very well
when someone's ready for pop.

20
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:24,139
What's your name?

21
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,227
Mary.

22
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:32,690
Mary or Maria?
What do people usually call you?

23
00:04:33,274 --> 00:04:34,942
Mary.

24
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:36,860
I'm going to call you Maria.

25
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:39,738
Do you have any siblings?

26
00:04:39,822 --> 00:04:40,990
No.

27
00:04:43,242 --> 00:04:45,786
Maria, you're hurt very badly.

28
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:48,622
There's a big chance you could die.

29
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:54,211
If I asked you to pick an actor,
who would it be?

30
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:58,090
Who's your favorite?

31
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:03,637
Look, I'll list some names.

32
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:07,224
If I hit on your favorite, make me a sign.

33
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:12,438
Brad Pitt.

34
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:15,316
No?

35
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:18,944
Johnny Depp.

36
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:22,865
What? Not Johnny Depp?

37
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:32,041
We brought in a girl, around 16 years old.

38
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:36,045
Car accident.
Internal bleeding, broken ribs.

39
00:05:36,462 --> 00:05:38,088
Plays tennis.

40
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:46,680
Must have played for years.
Her racquet's pretty light.

41
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:51,727
Did they take her in for surgery?

42
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:52,770
Yes.

43
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,356
And her family?

44
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:57,649
Her parents have been notified.

45
00:05:57,733 --> 00:05:59,234
Where are they taking her?

46
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,570
Room 205.

47
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:02,613
Okay.

48
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,620
She has no brothers or sisters.

49
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:13,165
Her favorite actor is Jude Law.

50
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:15,959
Okay.

51
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:19,421
Brunette? Blonde? Darker?

52
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:23,092
Brunette, dark brown.

53
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:27,262
Her head was covered in blood,
but I think dark brown.

54
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:31,475
- Coffee?
- Yes.

55
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:32,893
There's some in the kitchen.

56
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:35,396
Can I use your mug?

57
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:37,731
Just for today.
Tomorrow I'll bring my own.

58
00:06:37,815 --> 00:06:39,691
What's yours like?

59
00:06:39,817 --> 00:06:43,654
I'm asking in case there's another one
like it and there's a mix-up.

60
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:47,241
Blue with red writing.

61
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,243
What does it say?

62
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:51,286
"Los Angeles."

63
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,747
No, there isn't another one like it.

64
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,319
You must stay calm
in this sort of situation,

65
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:26,071
however difficult this may sound.

66
00:07:26,155 --> 00:07:27,197
Yes.

67
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:29,450
- Do you have any other children?
- No.

68
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:32,035
Everything'll be fine. She'll make it.

69
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:33,787
She seems tough.

70
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:36,999
She's an athlete. She plays tennis.

71
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:38,667
That's excellent.

72
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,169
I play tennis too.

73
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:43,755
An injury set me back a little,

74
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:46,508
but I've been much better
the last two years.

75
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:51,430
My wife is a former tennis champion.

76
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:53,640
I don't want you to worry.

77
00:07:53,724 --> 00:07:55,642
We're doing everything we can.

78
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:57,019
Your daughter will be fine.

79
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:59,271
She'll be back on the tennis court
before you know it.

80
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:01,231
You'll forget all this ever happened.

81
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:04,443
I'd like a favor.

82
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:10,991
This is her favorite wristband.

83
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,911
She wore it at every match.

84
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:18,123
I'd like you to give it to her.

85
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:19,917
It'll give her strength.

86
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:22,252
I don't know if she's allowed to wear it.

87
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:25,964
That won't be a problem.

88
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:29,635
You can give it to her yourself
when you see her.

89
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:34,223
Thank you.

90
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:55,786
Hello, Dad.

91
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:57,454
You're late.

92
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,748
It's five to ten.

93
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,417
It's ten past ten.

94
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:05,045
- There was traffic.
- I was worried.

95
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:06,672
I'm sorry.

96
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:09,841
I don't mind if you're late.
Just let me know.

97
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:12,302
I'm sorry.

98
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,838
I'm going to bed. Is there anything else?

99
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:52,759
It's going to rain tomorrow.
Take a jacket.

100
00:09:54,136 --> 00:09:55,262
All right.

101
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:01,810
Good night.

102
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:03,061
Good night.

103
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,935
Today is a special day.

104
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:52,444
As you know, we've been searching
for a good-sounding...

105
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:56,490
suitable name for our group
for a long time.

106
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,826
After much thought, I've decided on...

107
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:03,413
- "Alps."
- Alps?

108
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,290
Yes, Alps.

109
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:07,376
Why Alps?

110
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,380
Alps for two important reasons.

111
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:16,385
First, the name in no way reveals
what it is we do.

112
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:20,097
The second reason is purely symbolic.

113
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:25,894
The mountains of the Alps
cannot be replaced by any other mountain.

114
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:33,985
Anything else would be smaller,
less imposing,

115
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,237
and thus...

116
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:40,742
a poor substitute.

117
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:45,455
But what's fantastic is that while
the mountains of the Alps

118
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:48,917
cannot be replaced,

119
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,962
they could replace any other mountain.

120
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:57,592
Who could mind seeing,
in place of Mt. Ararat or Mt. McKinley...

121
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:00,262
one of the Alps?

122
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:07,853
Would you mind?

123
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:10,105
I wouldn't mind.

124
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:16,903
I'll take the name
of the highest mountain, Mont Blanc.

125
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:22,033
What about us?

126
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:27,831
You can choose from any
of the smaller mountains.

127
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,461
Do you know them?

128
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:40,594
Monte Rosa, Dom, Weisshorn, Matterhorn,

129
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:47,142
Finsteraarhorn, Aletschhorn,
Barre des Écrins,

130
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:52,939
Gran Paradiso, Piz Bernina, and one more,

131
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:55,650
Weissmies.

132
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:58,904
I made you photocopies.

133
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:26,973
I want the name Matterhorn.

134
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:30,060
Good.

135
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:33,271
Why?

136
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:35,857
It reminds me of my father.

137
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:39,027
When I was very little,
we took a trip there.

138
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:40,403
Where?

139
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,948
- To Matterhorn.
- In Switzerland?

140
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:45,450
At the foot of the mountain.

141
00:13:46,243 --> 00:13:47,786
Good afternoon.

142
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:51,039
Good afternoon. Just a minute.

143
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:02,300
- Hello.
- Hello.

144
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:09,307
- Please sit.
- Thanks.

145
00:14:12,978 --> 00:14:18,108
I brought the list you asked for
and the photograph.

146
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:24,197
Very good.

147
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:32,747
- You don't have a closer shot?
- I'm afraid not.

148
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:36,835
- A captain.
- A merchant navy captain.

149
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,296
He's wearing the insignia of a lieutenant.

150
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:41,715
It's an old photograph.

151
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:45,302
I couldn't find a more recent one.

152
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:48,263
He wore glasses.

153
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,932
I couldn't find them.

154
00:14:51,016 --> 00:14:52,642
But you must.

155
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,603
I'll look for them again.

156
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:58,607
We can't use any old glasses.
It won't look right.

157
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,317
I'll look again.

158
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:05,697
His name is Zachos.

159
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:08,116
That's right.

160
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:14,539
Anything in common
with that grill bar in Varkiza?

161
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:17,584
No, no. They just shared the same name.

162
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:21,546
Did you know him many years?

163
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:24,925
We were friends around 20 years.

164
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:26,635
Since college.

165
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,555
Cause of death?

166
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:32,641
Heart attack.

167
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,983
Favorite food?

168
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:44,736
Nothing in particular.

169
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,781
He maybe had a slight preference
for pasta.

170
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:49,866
Served plain?

171
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,243
- With red sauce.
- Napolitaine.

172
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:54,913
Yes, Napolitaine.

173
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:10,637
Don't worry.

174
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:18,561
He often used the word "anyway"
to start a sentence.

175
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:22,816
Like, he'd say,
"Anyway, it's very windy today."

176
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:25,735
Or, "Anyway, we'll talk later."

177
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:30,490
Or, "Anyway, it's very cold today."

178
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:32,867
I see.

179
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,583
Favorite foreign actor?

180
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:42,627
Morgan Freeman.

181
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:45,380
He liked to go to the movies on his own.

182
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:47,173
He'd go see all his films.

183
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,635
He usually went alone.

184
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:41,728
Is it too small?

185
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,230
- Yes.
- I think so too.

186
00:17:44,606 --> 00:17:46,649
We'll get it adjusted.

187
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:49,903
Maybe your hair's too thick?

188
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:52,447
No, it's not that.

189
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,365
My friend had no hair.

190
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:58,661
- Is that a problem for you?
- No.

191
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:01,247
I don't think so. No.

192
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:11,841
Great.

193
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:19,933
If he were wearing the glasses,
it would be completely different.

194
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:24,187
I'll look again. I'll find them.

195
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:26,981
- You have to.
- I will.

196
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:52,924
Hello.

197
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:58,012
Darling, Anna's come to visit.

198
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:00,056
My best friend.

199
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:03,268
Come here, sit down.

200
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:11,109
What a pleasant surprise.
I wasn't expecting you.

201
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:13,403
- I've missed you.
- Me too.

202
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,280
Would you like something to drink? Tea?

203
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:16,865
- Tea.
- Lovely.

204
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:31,337
Here you are.

205
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:33,464
Thank you.

206
00:19:35,425 --> 00:19:36,718
How are you?

207
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:40,722
- I'm fine.
- I'm glad.

208
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:44,934
Hello.

209
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:52,734
How are you, Anna?

210
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:54,861
We haven't seen you in ages.

211
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:57,030
I must say we've missed you.

212
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:00,074
I'm fine.

213
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:03,203
The weather's beautiful today, isn't it?

214
00:20:03,286 --> 00:20:04,454
Very.

215
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:06,873
I'm going to the office.

216
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:09,083
I have some important business to tend to.

217
00:20:09,167 --> 00:20:10,251
Will you be home late?

218
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:12,170
Yes. I'll be back late tonight.

219
00:20:12,295 --> 00:20:15,131
Fine. I'll make you your favorite dinner.

220
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:17,717
Schnitzel with mashed potatoes? Perfect.

221
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:28,603
I don't know what I'd do without him.

222
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:30,313
You're very lucky.

223
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:34,651
- Would you like me to read to you?
- Yes, I'd like that.

224
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:36,611
From a book or a magazine?

225
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,488
A magazine.

226
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:47,747
"What's Hot to Wear This Summer
and What's Not."

227
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:50,833
"Gianfranco Ferré: The King is Naked."

228
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:53,127
"A Trip to Guatemala:
Exotic and Mysterious."

229
00:20:53,211 --> 00:20:56,047
- "An Interview with Winona Ryder."
- That one.

230
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:09,060
"'Tell me, how do you start your day?'"

231
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:12,897
"'If I'm not working, I get up around ten
and make myself a cup of tea.

232
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:15,858
Then I sit and read the <i>New York Times.</i>

233
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:17,443
The rest of the morning,

234
00:21:17,527 --> 00:21:19,862
I make a few phone calls
and set up appointments.

235
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:21,614
When I'm in Los Angeles,

236
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:25,076
sometimes I take a long walk
around my house

237
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:29,872
either to revitalize myself,
or during the night, just to relax.'"

238
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:56,733
I've got a surprise for you.

239
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:00,820
Close your eyes.

240
00:22:11,414 --> 00:22:12,790
Do you like it?

241
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:47,575
Isn't it great?

242
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:52,330
Sorry.

243
00:23:16,771 --> 00:23:19,148
Isn't it great we've become friends?

244
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:23,694
Would you like me to sit with you
for a while? To talk?

245
00:23:27,782 --> 00:23:29,951
I want you to know
that whatever you tell me,

246
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:32,954
I won't say a thing to your parents.
It'll stay between us.

247
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:39,168
Are you pregnant?

248
00:23:43,214 --> 00:23:44,757
Don't be sad.

249
00:23:45,258 --> 00:23:47,218
You're too young to have a baby anyway.

250
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:49,762
There's lots of time for that
in the future.

251
00:23:49,804 --> 00:23:53,307
For now, you need to concentrate
on your schoolwork and your tennis.

252
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:59,439
Also you should know if you're pregnant,

253
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:02,859
you shouldn't be dyeing your hair.
It's really dangerous.

254
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:11,617
Anyway, your natural color is beautiful.

255
00:24:13,703 --> 00:24:15,580
It's dark brown, isn't it?

256
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:30,970
What happened?

257
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:34,682
Nothing.

258
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:38,019
What happened?

259
00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:43,816
I couldn't say something
I was supposed to say.

260
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:46,777
What couldn't you say?

261
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:52,325
"Grandpa, look, a beautiful mug
for your coffee or tea."

262
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:55,953
What did the old man do?

263
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:00,416
He got sad.

264
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:03,961
And what did you do?

265
00:25:06,756 --> 00:25:08,132
Nothing.

266
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:10,343
I left.

267
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:19,810
Don't tell Mont Blanc.

268
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:22,438
Please.

269
00:25:25,775 --> 00:25:29,487
He won't give me the car accident girl
if you tell him.

270
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:47,630
You're the king of coaches.

271
00:25:53,261 --> 00:25:55,137
You're the best...

272
00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:03,104
You're the best coach in the world.

273
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:13,948
I can't not tell him.

274
00:26:16,534 --> 00:26:17,910
I'm sorry.

275
00:27:42,536 --> 00:27:44,246
It's wonderful.

276
00:27:44,789 --> 00:27:46,248
Is it cold?

277
00:27:46,624 --> 00:27:49,251
No. Not at all.

278
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:16,362
Come out now. It's getting late.

279
00:28:16,696 --> 00:28:18,364
We have to leave.

280
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:24,120
Just a little longer.
Please, a little longer.

281
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:25,413
All right.

282
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:02,658
Cold is a word...

283
00:29:03,743 --> 00:29:07,121
that winter swimmers don't know.

284
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:15,963
It's so unfair
that you can't eat ice cream

285
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:18,090
because of your diabetes.

286
00:29:21,469 --> 00:29:23,387
But you hate chocolate anyway.

287
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:27,808
I would have a different flavor,
like strawberry, which is my favorite.

288
00:29:29,185 --> 00:29:31,479
There's no point talking about it.

289
00:29:31,562 --> 00:29:33,439
The doctor was quite clear about it.

290
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:35,065
You're right.

291
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:40,154
How about a walk along the beach?

292
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:42,448
That's a wonderful idea.

293
00:29:53,918 --> 00:29:57,755
Light fittings fall into three
main categories:

294
00:29:58,547 --> 00:30:03,052
domestic interior, domestic exterior,
and professional.

295
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:06,889
Then there are various sub-categories,

296
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:09,433
such as ceiling lamps,

297
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:12,144
table lamps, wall lamps,

298
00:30:12,228 --> 00:30:15,689
modern chandeliers, classic chandeliers,

299
00:30:15,773 --> 00:30:18,442
track lighting, uplighters,

300
00:30:18,484 --> 00:30:21,862
spotlights, pendant lamps,
and floor lamps.

301
00:30:21,946 --> 00:30:23,280
Repeat them back to me.

302
00:30:24,824 --> 00:30:26,492
Wall lamps, ceiling lamps,

303
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:29,995
classic chandeliers,
modern chandeliers, uplighters...

304
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:34,083
floor lamps, table lamps...

305
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:37,670
And pendant lamps.

306
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:40,172
And pendant lamps.

307
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:49,431
...and uplighters.

308
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:25,134
Again tonight.

309
00:31:34,602 --> 00:31:36,729
This afternoon there's going to be a ball.

310
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:37,813
What do you dance?

311
00:31:37,938 --> 00:31:42,610
Everything. Blues, tango, waltz.

312
00:31:43,736 --> 00:31:44,945
And Latin?

313
00:31:47,156 --> 00:31:48,365
And Latin.

314
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:50,743
- That's nice.
- Will you come?

315
00:31:52,453 --> 00:31:53,746
I'll be there.

316
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,801
Ready? And...

317
00:33:57,286 --> 00:34:00,414
Your daughter lost the most important...

318
00:34:07,046 --> 00:34:09,339
the most important match of her life.

319
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:11,425
I'm very sorry.

320
00:34:13,427 --> 00:34:14,928
My condolences.

321
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:22,895
But you must remember
that death is not the end.

322
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:24,146
On the contrary,

323
00:34:25,064 --> 00:34:29,443
it can be a new
and often better beginning.

324
00:34:32,905 --> 00:34:35,157
Your daughter fought hard,

325
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,534
but her opponent was too tough.

326
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:42,915
She was a truly remarkable person.
We'll all remember her.

327
00:34:43,457 --> 00:34:44,958
I'm sure of it.

328
00:35:04,103 --> 00:35:06,563
And now I have something wonderful
to tell you.

329
00:35:07,731 --> 00:35:10,275
I can substitute for her, if you like.

330
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:15,781
It will help ease your grief,
until after a while,

331
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:17,866
it disappears completely.

332
00:35:21,078 --> 00:35:24,248
Two or three two-hour visits
a week would be enough.

333
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:29,837
The end can be a new and better beginning.

334
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:33,715
It all depends on you.

335
00:35:39,388 --> 00:35:42,349
The first four visits are free.

336
00:35:44,518 --> 00:35:49,398
"Grandpa, look, a beautiful mug
for your coffee or tea.

337
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:53,527
Grandma'll be so jealous when she sees it,

338
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:56,780
but that's okay,
I bought her a present too--

339
00:35:56,864 --> 00:36:02,077
a wallet with pockets
for photographs and coins."

340
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:07,124
"Grandpa, look, a beautiful mug
for your coffee or tea."

341
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:11,962
The car accident girl's condition
is improving,

342
00:36:12,045 --> 00:36:14,423
and the doctors say she's out of danger.

343
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:16,633
They're calling it a miracle.

344
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:20,971
That's a shame.

345
00:36:21,471 --> 00:36:22,723
Yes, it is.

346
00:36:24,474 --> 00:36:25,642
Again.

347
00:36:27,436 --> 00:36:32,441
"Grandpa, look, a beautiful mug
for your coffee or tea.

348
00:36:33,025 --> 00:36:35,944
Grandma'll be so jealous when she sees it,

349
00:36:36,904 --> 00:36:40,032
but that's okay,
I bought her a present too--

350
00:36:40,115 --> 00:36:44,786
a wallet with pockets
for photographs and coins.

351
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:47,915
You sure missed out not coming with us.

352
00:36:47,998 --> 00:36:51,793
The view was wonderful
and the room was fantastic."

353
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:54,922
You won't be paid this month.

354
00:36:55,631 --> 00:36:57,299
I'm going to keep the money.

355
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:02,179
Again. Clearer.

356
00:37:07,601 --> 00:37:12,814
"Grandpa, look, a beautiful mug
for your coffee or tea."

357
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:20,906
What happened?

358
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:23,533
She made a mistake.

359
00:37:24,243 --> 00:37:25,911
Has it happened before?

360
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:28,121
This was the second time.

361
00:37:28,872 --> 00:37:30,666
Again with the old man.

362
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:12,207
Yesterday the barber who cut my hair
for the last 12 years died.

363
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,085
He had no family.

364
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:19,840
I went to the barbershop today,
and he wasn't there.

365
00:38:22,342 --> 00:38:25,887
Only he ever cut my hair, no one else.

366
00:38:28,557 --> 00:38:32,728
He always made sure my sideburns
were exactly the same length.

367
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:34,563
Both of them.

368
00:38:37,107 --> 00:38:38,734
Are they the same length now?

369
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:40,027
I don't know.

370
00:38:42,321 --> 00:38:43,363
They're not.

371
00:38:43,447 --> 00:38:45,073
I hadn't been in a while.

372
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:50,329
If he wasn't there,
I wouldn't book an appointment.

373
00:38:51,788 --> 00:38:54,207
I always arranged to go when he was there.

374
00:38:57,711 --> 00:38:59,713
Are you going to the funeral?

375
00:38:59,796 --> 00:39:00,839
No.

376
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:03,425
- Why not?
- I don't go to funerals.

377
00:39:06,762 --> 00:39:07,888
How did he die?

378
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:09,473
Heart attack.

379
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:22,397
You danced beautifully.

380
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:24,566
Thank you very much.

381
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,569
And your dance partner was wonderful.

382
00:41:28,278 --> 00:41:30,238
We always dance together.

383
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:33,283
Have you known each other long?

384
00:41:34,201 --> 00:41:36,119
About five months.

385
00:41:36,703 --> 00:41:38,163
Are you fond of her?

386
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,957
She's very nice.

387
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,878
What time is it?

388
00:42:11,571 --> 00:42:14,115
I didn't know you were such a good dancer.

389
00:42:17,827 --> 00:42:20,830
I used to dance with your mother
all the time.

390
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,875
Everything except Latin.

391
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:26,586
She hated Latin.

392
00:42:42,602 --> 00:42:45,355
You must always wear your hair up.

393
00:42:45,689 --> 00:42:47,607
And those aren't tennis shoes.

394
00:42:47,691 --> 00:42:48,858
Of course.

395
00:42:49,442 --> 00:42:51,945
What size shoe do you wear?

396
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:54,239
Thirty-eight or 39. It depends.

397
00:44:08,313 --> 00:44:10,690
It's amazing. They fit me perfectly.

398
00:44:10,774 --> 00:44:12,150
Amazing.

399
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:18,073
This is her perfume. "Eternity."

400
00:44:20,367 --> 00:44:22,702
It was a gift from her boyfriend.

401
00:44:23,745 --> 00:44:26,081
You'll have to meet him at some point.

402
00:44:39,302 --> 00:44:41,721
I was sure I'd beat her.

403
00:44:41,805 --> 00:44:43,181
I knew it.

404
00:44:44,224 --> 00:44:45,725
Her backhand was pathetic,

405
00:44:45,809 --> 00:44:48,436
and I knew right away
she didn't have a chance.

406
00:44:52,691 --> 00:44:54,359
Would you like some more water?

407
00:44:54,776 --> 00:44:56,444
No, thanks, Dad.

408
00:44:57,529 --> 00:44:59,823
You usually drink lots of water
after a match.

409
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,950
Okay, then, thanks.

410
00:45:34,941 --> 00:45:36,776
Bite your nails a little.

411
00:45:53,793 --> 00:45:55,044
That's enough.

412
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:20,779
I really like the latest substitution.

413
00:46:20,862 --> 00:46:21,946
The blind woman?

414
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:23,156
Yes.

415
00:46:23,865 --> 00:46:27,911
She lost her sight in her old age.
She's never told me how.

416
00:46:29,788 --> 00:46:32,749
She's a beautiful woman.
Her colors are intense.

417
00:46:33,124 --> 00:46:35,126
What do you mean, her colors are intense?

418
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:38,338
Green eyes, honey-colored hair.

419
00:46:38,421 --> 00:46:40,256
A strange combination.

420
00:46:41,216 --> 00:46:44,302
I go to her house in the center of Athens,

421
00:46:44,385 --> 00:46:46,221
a maisonette with a yard.

422
00:46:46,763 --> 00:46:50,183
She doesn't have much furniture.
Less things for her to trip over.

423
00:46:56,856 --> 00:46:58,733
We sit and I pretend to be her husband.

424
00:46:58,858 --> 00:47:00,026
Yes, I know.

425
00:47:00,527 --> 00:47:03,029
And I tell her stories for hours.

426
00:47:03,112 --> 00:47:04,781
She likes them a lot.

427
00:47:04,864 --> 00:47:06,950
Whatever pops into my head.

428
00:47:10,203 --> 00:47:12,664
She asks me to kiss her from time to time.

429
00:47:13,122 --> 00:47:14,874
And we kiss.

430
00:47:18,086 --> 00:47:19,504
Do you like it?

431
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:21,339
I like it a lot.

432
00:47:21,422 --> 00:47:23,132
I have a good time.

433
00:47:23,925 --> 00:47:26,177
I mean, do you like it when you kiss?

434
00:47:27,345 --> 00:47:30,598
I like it, yes. She's an active woman.

435
00:47:39,482 --> 00:47:41,901
Imagine if you were blind.

436
00:47:41,985 --> 00:47:44,821
You wouldn't be able to do
rhythmic gymnastics.

437
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,913
Get out of here.
Collect your things from home and leave.

438
00:48:34,996 --> 00:48:37,373
Go back to Toronto, go wherever you like,

439
00:48:37,457 --> 00:48:39,167
so long as I never see you again.

440
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:42,003
Fuck you. You're so controlling,
you make me miserable.

441
00:48:42,086 --> 00:48:45,131
I'm only thinking of your health, idiot.

442
00:48:45,214 --> 00:48:46,466
But I don't care anymore.

443
00:48:46,549 --> 00:48:49,302
Leave and then eat all the cakes
and desserts you like.

444
00:48:49,385 --> 00:48:50,637
I will leave.

445
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:53,348
Get out of my sight.

446
00:48:53,848 --> 00:48:55,850
I don't want to see you again.

447
00:49:25,755 --> 00:49:29,550
Get out of here.
Collect your things from home and leave.

448
00:49:29,634 --> 00:49:32,387
Go back to Toronto, go wherever you like,

449
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:34,180
so long as I never see you again.

450
00:49:34,263 --> 00:49:37,767
Fuck you. You're so controlling,
you make me miserable.

451
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:40,853
I'm only thinking of your health, idiot.

452
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:43,189
But I don't care anymore.

453
00:49:43,272 --> 00:49:47,235
Leave and then eat all the cakes
and desserts you like.

454
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:48,820
I will leave.

455
00:49:55,118 --> 00:49:56,703
Get out of my sight.

456
00:49:56,786 --> 00:49:58,579
I don't want to see you again.

457
00:50:03,751 --> 00:50:05,753
I'm sorry. I love you.

458
00:50:07,255 --> 00:50:08,756
I love you too.

459
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:11,551
I'm only hard on you for your own good.

460
00:50:13,428 --> 00:50:14,679
I know.

461
00:51:33,549 --> 00:51:36,552
If Mont Blanc finds out about this,
there'll be trouble.

462
00:51:37,303 --> 00:51:39,722
We may have to end our arrangement.

463
00:51:40,932 --> 00:51:42,517
He won't find out.

464
00:51:43,518 --> 00:51:45,645
Not from me anyway.

465
00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:54,779
Leave your blouse on. Take off your skirt.

466
00:51:59,283 --> 00:52:00,368
And my tights?

467
00:52:00,993 --> 00:52:02,703
Take them off too.

468
00:52:03,121 --> 00:52:07,291
Try not to talk too loudly.

469
00:52:07,375 --> 00:52:09,502
I should barely be able to hear you.

470
00:52:10,378 --> 00:52:12,338
At some point you'll say:

471
00:52:12,421 --> 00:52:13,840
"Please...

472
00:52:14,507 --> 00:52:16,676
Please, don't you stop.

473
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:19,762
It feels like heaven."

474
00:52:20,513 --> 00:52:21,764
And that's it.

475
00:53:09,729 --> 00:53:11,731
Please, don't you stop.

476
00:53:11,814 --> 00:53:14,150
It feels like paradise.

477
00:53:15,610 --> 00:53:16,944
"Heaven."

478
00:53:25,745 --> 00:53:26,913
Please...

479
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,500
don't you stop. It feels like heaven.

480
00:53:45,306 --> 00:53:47,475
Please, don't you stop.

481
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:49,894
It feels like heaven.

482
00:55:17,106 --> 00:55:20,526
He said I'd never get to perform to pop.

483
00:55:20,609 --> 00:55:21,736
Why?

484
00:55:23,112 --> 00:55:24,363
I don't know.

485
00:55:26,657 --> 00:55:28,367
But I can't take it anymore.

486
00:55:28,784 --> 00:55:31,495
What you just tried to do
was very immature.

487
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:36,083
You're a very good gymnast.
It would be a terrible shame if you died.

488
00:55:37,335 --> 00:55:39,670
I'll talk to him.

489
00:55:42,214 --> 00:55:44,091
Thank you, Monte Rosa.

490
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:50,890
You know it'll be very difficult
to change his mind.

491
00:55:50,973 --> 00:55:53,309
But there's no harm in trying.

492
00:55:54,894 --> 00:55:57,104
Is there a particular song you want?

493
00:56:01,484 --> 00:56:03,361
I'm between two of them.

494
00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:12,620
I'll do anything you want.

495
00:56:13,454 --> 00:56:16,999
Let her train with a pop song,
and I'll do anything you want.

496
00:56:17,833 --> 00:56:18,834
Anything I want?

497
00:56:18,918 --> 00:56:20,211
Anything you want.

498
00:56:26,217 --> 00:56:27,385
Think about it.

499
00:56:46,153 --> 00:56:47,530
I've thought of something.

500
00:57:05,131 --> 00:57:06,924
- Tell me where.
- Further in.

501
00:57:07,007 --> 00:57:09,218
- Come on. All right?
- Yes.

502
00:59:26,063 --> 00:59:28,148
How could you? With my husband?

503
00:59:28,232 --> 00:59:30,025
You're my best friend.

504
00:59:30,776 --> 00:59:32,528
I hate you both!

505
00:59:48,335 --> 00:59:51,505
Shame on you. Get out of my sight.

506
01:00:13,944 --> 01:00:15,779
You've got a nice body.

507
01:00:17,197 --> 01:00:18,616
So do you.

508
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:21,368
Are you cold?

509
01:00:21,452 --> 01:00:22,578
No, not at all.

510
01:00:22,661 --> 01:00:25,789
I turned the heat on,
but it takes a while to warm up.

511
01:00:26,165 --> 01:00:27,625
It doesn't matter.

512
01:01:36,568 --> 01:01:38,612
Dad, would you like to dance with me?

513
01:01:38,696 --> 01:01:41,532
Not now. Some other time.

514
01:01:43,867 --> 01:01:45,244
Tonight?

515
01:01:45,703 --> 01:01:47,037
Tonight.

516
01:01:48,288 --> 01:01:49,748
Promise?

517
01:02:37,004 --> 01:02:38,505
I have to go.

518
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:43,385
Please stay a little longer.

519
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:47,973
Okay.

520
01:03:16,251 --> 01:03:20,130
Let's not wait for her any longer.
It looks like she isn't coming.

521
01:03:21,590 --> 01:03:23,801
I agree, she's very late.

522
01:03:24,301 --> 01:03:25,511
Who's up first?

523
01:03:25,594 --> 01:03:27,221
Can I go first?

524
01:03:50,828 --> 01:03:52,579
Are you a man or woman?

525
01:03:53,038 --> 01:03:54,248
A man.

526
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:15,185
I'll give you a little longer.

527
01:04:19,106 --> 01:04:20,941
- I don't know.
- Me either.

528
01:04:24,987 --> 01:04:26,196
I'm Prince.

529
01:04:26,822 --> 01:04:27,781
Who?

530
01:04:29,491 --> 01:04:30,576
Prince.

531
01:04:32,452 --> 01:04:34,580
You can't substitute for Prince.

532
01:04:34,663 --> 01:04:35,664
Why?

533
01:04:36,290 --> 01:04:38,125
Prince isn't dead.

534
01:04:39,126 --> 01:04:40,586
Prince is dead.

535
01:04:40,961 --> 01:04:42,671
Prince is alive.

536
01:04:49,177 --> 01:04:50,429
Sorry.

537
01:05:34,848 --> 01:05:37,225
You missed our meeting yesterday.

538
01:05:37,559 --> 01:05:39,353
I know.

539
01:05:39,895 --> 01:05:44,232
It's just that I had to cover
a colleague's shift. They were busy.

540
01:05:44,316 --> 01:05:45,525
Here.

541
01:05:49,446 --> 01:05:51,239
So you were here.

542
01:05:55,869 --> 01:05:59,039
Your mug is clean.
You didn't drink any coffee all night?

543
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:08,215
I used it. I hope you don't mind.

544
01:06:08,340 --> 01:06:10,926
No, I don't mind at all.

545
01:06:13,553 --> 01:06:15,639
I couldn't find mine.

546
01:06:19,685 --> 01:06:22,270
Well, it's a shame
you didn't come yesterday.

547
01:06:22,312 --> 01:06:26,400
It was fun.
The little one stood in for Prince.

548
01:06:26,483 --> 01:06:28,276
But Prince isn't dead.

549
01:06:28,652 --> 01:06:30,487
Prince isn't dead?

550
01:06:33,031 --> 01:06:34,116
No.

551
01:06:37,035 --> 01:06:38,370
He isn't dead.

552
01:06:48,755 --> 01:06:53,135
Have you seen anyone drinking from my mug?

553
01:06:53,677 --> 01:06:57,347
The one with red writing
that says "Los Angeles"?

554
01:06:57,431 --> 01:06:59,266
Not that I remember.

555
01:07:02,894 --> 01:07:04,396
Strange.

556
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:07,858
You can use mine anytime you want.

557
01:09:33,211 --> 01:09:35,505
Thanks a lot. I don't smoke.

558
01:09:35,589 --> 01:09:37,841
You'd be better off if you gave it up.

559
01:09:44,222 --> 01:09:46,641
- Nice shoes.
- Thanks.

560
01:09:49,603 --> 01:09:52,105
Yesterday I saw a movie
about an old soldier,

561
01:09:52,189 --> 01:09:54,941
called for one final mission.

562
01:09:55,025 --> 01:09:58,028
At first he refuses,
but then he gets armored up and goes.

563
01:09:58,111 --> 01:09:59,779
I think I've seen it.

564
01:10:37,734 --> 01:10:41,780
Mom, Dad,
I didn't expect you home so soon.

565
01:10:41,863 --> 01:10:45,283
Vassilis is a friend from school.
We were just dancing.

566
01:11:02,717 --> 01:11:05,220
- Want to go back to my place?
- Sure.

567
01:11:25,407 --> 01:11:26,741
Hello, Dad.

568
01:11:27,325 --> 01:11:30,954
This is Vassilis.
Vassilis, this is my dad.

569
01:11:31,329 --> 01:11:32,956
- Hello.
- Hello.

570
01:11:33,039 --> 01:11:36,167
We're going to my room
to sit and listen to music.

571
01:11:36,251 --> 01:11:39,212
- If you need anything, let me know.
- Okay.

572
01:11:39,296 --> 01:11:42,173
If the music is too loud,
tell me and I'll turn it down.

573
01:11:42,257 --> 01:11:43,591
- All right?
- All right.

574
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:57,684
It's too loud. Turn it down.

575
01:14:36,222 --> 01:14:39,225
If you're cold,
just say and I'll turn the heating on.

576
01:14:40,101 --> 01:14:41,478
I'm not cold.

577
01:14:49,694 --> 01:14:53,031
Vassilis is younger than I am,
but we're a good match.

578
01:14:55,158 --> 01:14:56,784
In many ways.

579
01:14:57,911 --> 01:14:59,871
We share many common interests.

580
01:15:01,289 --> 01:15:02,916
Music, sport...

581
01:15:05,793 --> 01:15:08,046
We met at the hospital.

582
01:15:08,922 --> 01:15:14,010
He's a track athlete, 110-meter hurdles.

583
01:15:15,303 --> 01:15:17,931
He fell during a race...

584
01:15:19,599 --> 01:15:21,893
jumping over one of the hurdles...

585
01:15:23,561 --> 01:15:26,356
and fractured his wrist.

586
01:15:32,445 --> 01:15:34,364
I helped with his splint.

587
01:15:34,447 --> 01:15:36,324
And I gave him a painkiller.

588
01:15:41,788 --> 01:15:45,667
Also... he's very creative.

589
01:15:47,877 --> 01:15:49,420
He plays the guitar.

590
01:15:52,674 --> 01:15:56,844
He covers songs with his band at school.

591
01:15:59,639 --> 01:16:01,516
He sings and...

592
01:16:36,175 --> 01:16:37,135
Hi.

593
01:16:37,218 --> 01:16:38,720
Who is it, darling?

594
01:16:39,387 --> 01:16:40,847
A friend from school, Mom.

595
01:16:42,473 --> 01:16:47,145
I'm sorry, I can't come out with you
because I've got homework to do,

596
01:16:47,228 --> 01:16:51,566
and then I have to attend
a very important tennis tournament.

597
01:16:52,066 --> 01:16:54,027
I'll see you tomorrow at school.

598
01:17:35,443 --> 01:17:37,070
We're going to do a test.

599
01:17:39,030 --> 01:17:41,324
I'm going to use this object.

600
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:45,411
If it doesn't change color
and stays white...

601
01:17:46,746 --> 01:17:49,499
then it automatically means
that you are competent and reliable,

602
01:17:49,582 --> 01:17:52,001
and can stay in our group.

603
01:17:52,794 --> 01:17:54,337
If it changes color,

604
01:17:54,837 --> 01:17:56,798
there are two possibilities.

605
01:17:58,424 --> 01:17:59,634
First,

606
01:18:00,176 --> 01:18:01,761
it can turn blue.

607
01:18:01,844 --> 01:18:03,179
If it turns blue,

608
01:18:03,763 --> 01:18:05,723
then it automatically means...

609
01:18:07,183 --> 01:18:08,685
that you are competent...

610
01:18:09,852 --> 01:18:11,604
but unreliable.

611
01:18:12,146 --> 01:18:13,356
Therefore?

612
01:18:15,441 --> 01:18:18,695
There's no therefore.
It doesn't really matter if it turns blue.

613
01:18:19,070 --> 01:18:20,530
It's just something I said.

614
01:18:23,032 --> 01:18:25,535
The second and worst possible outcome...

615
01:18:26,536 --> 01:18:28,162
is for this club

616
01:18:28,913 --> 01:18:30,331
to turn red...

617
01:18:32,250 --> 01:18:34,127
which means automatically...

618
01:18:35,378 --> 01:18:37,714
that you are too unreliable

619
01:18:37,797 --> 01:18:40,800
and too incompetent to stay with us.

620
01:18:51,561 --> 01:18:52,979
Let's see.

621
01:19:18,296 --> 01:19:19,881
It changed.

622
01:19:19,964 --> 01:19:21,132
It turned red.

623
01:19:23,092 --> 01:19:25,344
I'm afraid you'll have to go.

624
01:21:53,910 --> 01:21:56,621
Drink it now, before the ice melts.

625
01:22:01,459 --> 01:22:02,752
It's very good.

626
01:22:09,675 --> 01:22:12,345
Who was Mom's favorite actor?

627
01:22:14,764 --> 01:22:16,432
Robert Redford.

628
01:22:17,642 --> 01:22:19,101
Mine too.

629
01:22:20,394 --> 01:22:22,188
And her favorite singer?

630
01:22:24,982 --> 01:22:26,859
Harry Belafonte.

631
01:22:28,486 --> 01:22:29,779
And yours?

632
01:22:33,074 --> 01:22:34,659
Elvis Presley.

633
01:22:35,368 --> 01:22:36,619
Mine too.

634
01:28:03,821 --> 01:28:05,823
Nice shoes. Thanks.

635
01:28:05,906 --> 01:28:08,033
Yesterday I saw a movie

636

01:28:12,913 --> 01:28:14,206

639
01:28:14,290 --> 01:28:16,709
Mom, Dad,
I didn't expect you home so soon.

640
01:28:16,792 --> 01:28:19,378
Vassilis is a friend from school.

641
01:28:19,461 --> 01:28:20,963

642
01:28:21,046 --> 01:28:23,549
Yesterday I saw a movie

643
01:28:23,632 --> 01:28:25,634

01:28:28,804 --> 01:28:30,389

646
01:28:30,472 --> 01:28:33,600
Mom, Dad,
I didn't expect you home so soon.

647
01:28:42,818 --> 01:28:44,945
Dad, can you bring me some water, please?

648
01:29:06,550 --> 01:29:07,760
Dad?

649
01:29:08,844 --> 01:29:10,346
I'm home.

650
01:29:13,098 --> 01:29:15,142
Can you open the door, please?

651
01:29:16,810 --> 01:29:18,812
I was really good today.

652
01:29:19,605 --> 01:29:21,315
4-2 in the set.

653
01:31:36,408 --> 01:31:39,870
You're the best coach in the world.
