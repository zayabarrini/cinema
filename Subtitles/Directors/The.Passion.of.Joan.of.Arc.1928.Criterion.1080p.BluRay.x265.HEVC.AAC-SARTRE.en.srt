00:00:53,846 --> 00:01:00,018
THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC

2
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:53,613
In Paris, the library
of the Chamber of Deputies

3
00:01:53,698 --> 00:01:59,619
holds one of the most extraordinary
documents in the history of the world:

4
00:01:59,704 --> 00:02:02,872
the minutes of the trial
of Joan of Arc,

5
00:02:02,957 --> 00:02:06,793
a trial which ended
in her sentencing and death.

6
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:27,897
In it, the judges' questions and Joan's
answers are meticulously recorded.

7
00:02:30,026 --> 00:02:33,361
Reading it, we discover Joan
as she really was.

8
00:02:33,446 --> 00:02:37,032
Not the Joan in helmet and armor,
but simple and human.

9
00:02:37,116 --> 00:02:39,909
A young woman who died for her country.

10
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:46,291
We witness an astounding drama:

11
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,877
a young, deeply religious woman

12
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:53,048
attacked by a horde of blinded
theologians and experienced lawyers.

13
00:04:26,559 --> 00:04:29,811
I swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth...

14
00:04:31,814 --> 00:04:34,232
nothing but the truth.

15
00:04:56,589 --> 00:04:59,799
In France, they call me Joan.

16
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:11,978
In my village,
they called me Joanie.

17
00:05:17,193 --> 00:05:19,194
How old are you?

18
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:32,457
Nineteen. I think.

19
00:05:40,925 --> 00:05:43,343
Do you know the Lord's Prayer?

20
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:51,142
Who taught it to you?

21
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:13,748
My mother.

22
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:24,259
Would you recite the Lord's Prayer?

23
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:43,861
You claim to have been sent by God?

24
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,542
To save France.

25
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,968
That's why I was born.

26
00:07:16,604 --> 00:07:19,439
So you think
God hates the English?

27
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:39,042
I know nothing of God's love or hatred
for the English...

28
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:49,052
but I know the English will
all soon be driven out of France...

29
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:12,992
except those who die here!

30
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:49,278
You said Saint Michael appeared to you.
What did he look like?

31
00:08:54,702 --> 00:08:56,703
Did he have wings?

32
00:09:00,082 --> 00:09:02,500
Was he wearing a crown?

33
00:09:10,134 --> 00:09:12,552
How was he dressed?

34
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:33,656
How could you know
if it was a man or a woman?

35
00:09:39,455 --> 00:09:41,456
Was he naked?

36
00:09:53,469 --> 00:09:57,138
Do you think
God is unable to clothe him?

37
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:07,064
Did he have long hair?

38
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:17,408
Why would he have cut it?

39
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:28,336
Why do you wear men's clothes?

40
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:37,512
If we give you women's clothes,
will you wear them?

41
00:10:54,947 --> 00:10:58,074
When the mission God gave me
is finished,

42
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,701
I will wear women's clothes again.

43
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:46,789
So it was God who commanded you
to wear men's clothes?

44
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:02,138
And what reward do you hope
to gain from Our Lord?

45
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:16,944
The salvation of my soul.

46
00:12:25,913 --> 00:12:27,914
You blaspheme God.

47
00:12:56,068 --> 00:12:57,652
This is disgraceful.

48
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,533
To me, she is a saint.

49
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:45,111
Did God promise you anything?

50
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:06,215
That has nothing to do
with your trial.

51
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:18,394
Shouldn't we let
the judges decide that?

52
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:27,069
Would you like
to put it to a vote?

53
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:56,807
Well, then!
What did God promise you?

54
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:02,605
Perhaps he told you
you'd be freed from prison?

55
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:13,073
When?

56
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,841
I know neither the day...

57
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:37,765
nor the hour.

58
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:17,846
She doesn't want to make a confession,
so we must use wiles to get it.

59
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:33,028
Fetch a letter bearing
King Charles's signature.

60
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:45,291
I will dictate the letter.

61
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:34,042
I have such compassion for you!

62
00:22:02,405 --> 00:22:06,492
Can you recognize
your king's signature?

63
00:22:20,882 --> 00:22:23,717
I have a letter from him
for you.

64
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:44,446
I don't know how to read.

65
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:51,954
"To our dear, beloved Joan...

66
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:04,508
I make ready to march upon Rouen
with a great army.

67
00:23:08,388 --> 00:23:12,891
I send you this devoted priest.
Trust him."

68
00:24:01,232 --> 00:24:06,153
As Jesus is God's son,
do you consider yourself God's daughter?

69
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:14,578
Now will you recite
the Lord's Prayer?

70
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:57,788
Did God tell you
you'd be freed from prison?

71
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:16,139
Yes, through a great victory!

72
00:25:58,015 --> 00:26:01,685
Did God promise
you'd go to heaven?

73
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:22,748
So you are certain
of your salvation?

74
00:26:39,557 --> 00:26:42,809
Be careful,
that's a dangerous answer.

75
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:14,758
So if you are sure of your salvation,
you have no need of the Church?

76
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:41,117
Are you in a state of grace?

77
00:28:19,657 --> 00:28:22,909
Well, now! Answer!
Are you in a state of grace?

78
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:46,141
If I am,
may God keep me there.

79
00:28:53,316 --> 00:28:56,568
If I am not,
may God bestow His grace upon me!

80
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:24,095
Sir...

81
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:35,231
allow me to hear Mass.

82
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:16,982
Joan, if we allow you
to hear Mass...

83
00:30:20,695 --> 00:30:23,947
will you lay aside
your men's clothes?

84
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:54,936
So you prefer your men's clothes
to hearing Mass?

85
00:30:59,984 --> 00:31:01,985
That immodest garb...

86
00:31:08,034 --> 00:31:10,035
abominable to God.

87
00:31:26,927 --> 00:31:29,345
You are no daughter of God.

88
00:31:32,141 --> 00:31:34,976
You are a servant of Satan!

89
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:43,068
Prepare the torture.

90
00:33:38,976 --> 00:33:41,811
She sure looks
like a daughter of God.

91
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:32,153
In the torture chamber.

92
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:10,024
Look at your judges.

93
00:35:18,909 --> 00:35:23,830
Are not these learned doctors
of the Church wiser than you?

94
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:34,048
But God is wiser still!

95
00:35:44,393 --> 00:35:49,314
Listen, Joan, we know your revelations
do not come from God...

96
00:35:53,444 --> 00:35:55,445
but from the devil.

97
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:11,002
How do you tell a good angel
from a bad angel?

98
00:36:19,553 --> 00:36:24,766
You kneeled before Satan,
not Saint Michael!

99
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:39,447
Don't you see it's the devil
who has confused you...

100
00:36:43,494 --> 00:36:45,495
tricked you...

101
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:50,750
and betrayed you?

102
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:08,643
I think she's ready to sign
the letter of abjuration!

103
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:03,614
The Church opens its arms to you.

104
00:38:09,955 --> 00:38:14,876
If you refuse, the Church will abandon you
and you will be alone.

105
00:38:18,547 --> 00:38:20,131
Alone!

106
00:38:22,926 --> 00:38:24,927
Yes, alone.

107
00:38:29,475 --> 00:38:31,893
Alone with God!

108
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:57,770
Even if you tear my soul from my body,
I will renounce nothing.

109
00:40:02,276 --> 00:40:08,447
And if I do say anything, afterward,
I'll say you forced it out of me!

110
00:41:24,858 --> 00:41:28,944
She must not die
a natural death.

111
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:38,829
She is very weak.

112
00:41:44,503 --> 00:41:47,755
She is feverish.
She must be bled.

113
00:41:52,511 --> 00:41:57,014
Be careful, she could kill herself.
She's very cunning.

114
00:42:51,987 --> 00:42:54,405
Get the Sacraments.

115
00:43:48,251 --> 00:43:50,669
You have nothing to say to us?

116
00:44:02,766 --> 00:44:06,018
I fear I'm in great danger of dying...

117
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:17,822
and if I do,
I ask to be buried in holy ground.

118
00:44:29,876 --> 00:44:32,711
The Church is merciful.

119
00:44:39,678 --> 00:44:42,930
It always welcomes its lost sheep.

120
00:45:02,242 --> 00:45:04,618
Joan, we all want to help you.

121
00:45:04,703 --> 00:45:07,997
You see,
I've sent for the Holy Sacrament.

122
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:50,915
I am a good Christian.

123
00:46:50,433 --> 00:46:54,937
Don't you know that what you refuse
is the Body of Christ?

124
00:47:01,945 --> 00:47:06,865
Can't you see that you offend God
with your stubbornness?

125
00:47:57,917 --> 00:48:01,128
I love and honor God
with all my heart.

126
00:48:39,084 --> 00:48:42,795
You say that I am sent by the devil.

127
00:48:52,222 --> 00:48:54,223
That is not true.

128
00:48:57,852 --> 00:49:02,356
It is you who are sent by the devil
to make me suffer.

129
00:49:06,361 --> 00:49:07,945
And you.

130
00:49:10,865 --> 00:49:12,491
And you.

131
00:49:15,078 --> 00:49:16,662
And you.

132
00:49:30,468 --> 00:49:34,555
There's nothing left to do.
Summon the executioner!

133
00:51:09,108 --> 00:51:13,612
For the last time,
let us try to save this lost soul.

134
00:51:38,304 --> 00:51:41,139
I'm speaking to you, Joan.

135
00:51:45,228 --> 00:51:48,897
And I tell you
your king is a heretic!

136
00:51:52,986 --> 00:51:57,072
My king is the most noble
of all Christians.

137
00:52:09,711 --> 00:52:12,963
This woman's arrogance is outrageous.

138
00:53:19,989 --> 00:53:23,658
Never has France seen
such a monster.

139
00:53:35,588 --> 00:53:38,840
I never hurt anyone.

140
00:53:51,813 --> 00:53:55,482
If you don't sign,
you'll be burned alive.

141
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:01,655
Look, the executioner awaits.

142
00:54:15,253 --> 00:54:19,756
You don't have the right to die.
Your king still needs your help.

143
00:54:37,942 --> 00:54:41,194
Joan, sign...
and save your life!

144
00:54:48,202 --> 00:54:51,455
Joan, we have such pity for you.

145
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,921
Sign, Joan!

146
00:56:35,017 --> 00:56:37,852
In the Lord's name.
Amen.

147
00:56:45,736 --> 00:56:51,491
As you have admitted your errors, we free
you from the bonds of excommunication.

148
00:56:58,749 --> 00:57:03,253
But because you have rashly sinned,
we condemn you...

149
00:57:11,554 --> 00:57:16,891
to perpetual imprisonment with the bread
of sorrow and the water of affliction.

150
00:57:26,736 --> 00:57:32,073
You have done well this day:
You have saved your life and your soul.

151
00:58:05,232 --> 00:58:08,443
She made fools of you!

152
00:58:14,158 --> 00:58:16,159
Long live Joan!

153
01:00:08,189 --> 01:00:10,607
Fetch the judges!

154
01:00:13,527 --> 01:00:16,362
I repent. I lied.

155
01:00:19,158 --> 01:00:21,159
Hurry!

156
01:01:06,038 --> 01:01:08,414
I've done something very bad.

157
01:01:31,522 --> 01:01:34,357
I betrayed God to save my life.

158
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:42,323
But, Joan, before the people

159
01:01:42,408 --> 01:01:45,785
you admitted
you'd been led by the devil.

160
01:01:59,717 --> 01:02:03,803
So you still believe
you are God's chosen one?

161
01:02:21,906 --> 01:02:24,741
That answer is her death sentence.

162
01:02:59,735 --> 01:03:02,987
I only confessed
out of fear of the flames.

163
01:03:12,790 --> 01:03:15,208
Do you have anything else
to tell us?

164
01:04:36,582 --> 01:04:40,251
We have come
to prepare you for death.

165
01:04:54,558 --> 01:04:56,976
Is it time... already?

166
01:05:07,112 --> 01:05:08,696
How am I to die?

167
01:05:13,744 --> 01:05:15,745
At the stake.

168
01:05:26,882 --> 01:05:29,300
I'll get the viaticum.

169
01:05:37,643 --> 01:05:42,980
Tell me, how can you still believe
you were sent by God?

170
01:05:47,861 --> 01:05:50,696
God moves in mysterious ways.

171
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:04,168
Yes, I am His child.

172
01:06:15,097 --> 01:06:17,515
And the great victory?

173
01:06:26,483 --> 01:06:28,484
My martyrdom!

174
01:06:33,782 --> 01:06:35,783
And your freedom?

175
01:06:56,054 --> 01:06:57,638
Death!

176
01:07:20,662 --> 01:07:22,663
Do you wish to make confession?

177
01:07:38,138 --> 01:07:42,767
RELAPSED HERETIC,
APOSTATE, IDOLATER

178
01:10:02,991 --> 01:10:07,495
Joan, be brave.
Your last hour is near.

179
01:11:30,662 --> 01:11:34,748
Sweet God,
I accept death gladly...

180
01:11:52,976 --> 01:11:56,645
but don't let me suffer too long.

181
01:12:01,526 --> 01:12:05,196
Will I be with You
tonight in paradise?

182
01:17:04,496 --> 01:17:06,497
Jesus!

183
01:17:14,589 --> 01:17:17,007
You have burned a saint!

184
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:21,066
The protective flames surrounded
Joan's soul as she rose to heaven.

185
01:20:21,150 --> 01:20:27,447
Joan, whose heart
has become the heart of France.

186
01:20:27,532 --> 01:20:34,496
Joan, whose memory
will be honored by the French forever.

187
01:20:40,795 --> 01:20:44,464
THE END

188
01:20:44,549 --> 01:20:46,633
This film was restored in 2015 by Gaumont

189
01:20:46,718 --> 01:20:49,886
with funding from the Centre national
du cinéma et de l'image animée.

190
01:20:49,971 --> 01:20:53,432
The restoration was based on a copy
printed by the Cinémathèque Française

191
01:20:53,516 --> 01:20:55,517
for reconstruction of the film in 1985.

192
01:20:55,601 --> 01:20:57,602
As the original negative was lost,

193
01:20:57,687 --> 01:21:01,189
it was printed from a nitrate copy
conserved at the Danish Film Institute.

194
01:21:01,274 --> 01:21:04,568
The Danish intertitles were translated
into French by Maurice Drouzy.
