1
00:03:19,017 --> 00:03:20,225
What's it made of?

2
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:22,392
Bull's horn

3
00:03:22,558 --> 00:03:23,558
I'll take them

4
00:03:23,725 --> 00:03:24,933
Thank you

5
00:03:25,225 --> 00:03:27,475
Buy the small ones for me, Mum?

6
00:03:27,642 --> 00:03:29,183
Of course, my darling

7
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,809
You want them all!

8
00:03:31,017 --> 00:03:33,350
Put them on me, Mum?

9
00:03:39,434 --> 00:03:40,642
You are beautiful!

10
00:03:40,809 --> 00:03:41,767
You like me?

11
00:03:41,934 --> 00:03:43,892
You are ravishing.

12
00:03:44,684 --> 00:03:45,434
Really?

13
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,517
Honestly. Hey, careful with the hat!

14
00:03:52,642 --> 00:03:54,767
Buy one?

15
00:03:56,975 --> 00:03:57,725
You like it?

16
00:03:57,934 --> 00:03:59,642
I find it obscene.

17
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:03,767
Obscene? When one can hear Yemaya,

18
00:04:03,975 --> 00:04:06,225
The goddess of the oceans

19
00:04:18,767 --> 00:04:21,225
You want to buy a hat?

20
00:04:21,475 --> 00:04:22,184
Mum!

21
00:04:22,392 --> 00:04:23,850
Oh, what a pretty blonde!

22
00:04:24,059 --> 00:04:26,017
You play dice?

23
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:27,892
Play with us!

24
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,142
Where's my little girl?

25
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:34,309
She's having fun over there.

26
00:04:34,517 --> 00:04:35,767
Rebecca!

27
00:04:44,725 --> 00:04:46,184
What happened?

28
00:04:46,392 --> 00:04:47,642
I lost an earring

29
00:04:48,434 --> 00:04:49,600
You are the father?

30
00:04:49,809 --> 00:04:51,059
The
father-in-law.

31
00:04:51,225 --> 00:04:55,059
A pretty girl. Can I buy her from you?

32
00:04:55,892 --> 00:04:58,184
Interesting idea. How much?

33
00:04:58,392 --> 00:04:59,392
A thousand coconuts!

34
00:04:59,725 --> 00:05:01,100
A thousand coconuts?

35
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:03,225
She is worth much more!

36
00:05:03,392 --> 00:05:08,600
Look at this hair, these eyes,
these teeth. She is healthy.

37
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:10,975
And wild like you

38
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:13,225
A thousand coconuts

39
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:15,392
Fifteen hundred

40
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:19,642
- Two thousand coconuts minimum
- don't play the fool!

41
00:05:19,809 --> 00:05:22,892
Two thousand coconuts minimum

42
00:05:25,017 --> 00:05:26,434
Who'll give them?

43
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,767
She's gone! You always torment her!

44
00:06:18,517 --> 00:06:21,184
B. del Pramo, who does
not sing any more..

45
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:24,725
since her 2nd marriage to Mr. Ocana...

46
00:06:24,892 --> 00:06:27,809
has had an interesting offer of...

47
00:06:27,975 --> 00:06:29,975
a role in Mexico.

48
00:06:30,225 --> 00:06:32,934
To work? You have the house

49
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,434
and your daughter to
look after she needs it..

50
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,559
Don't involve Rebecca in this...

51
00:06:38,725 --> 00:06:41,434
I am an artist, not a housewife!

52
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,934
I did not have to get married

53
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:47,559
I am not the only married actress

54
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,892
We'll talk about it on my return

55
00:06:51,059 --> 00:06:55,100
I do not want to argue,
I'm going to accept

56
00:06:55,267 --> 00:06:56,267
No chance

57
00:06:56,434 --> 00:06:57,267
What?

58
00:06:57,475 --> 00:07:01,475
As long as you are my wife,
you will remain here...

59
00:07:01,642 --> 00:07:02,309
me...

60
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,142
I am not modern like your ex-husband.

61
00:07:05,309 --> 00:07:07,267
That, I know.

62
00:07:11,642 --> 00:07:13,642
Valium...

63
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:16,100
Ponderil...

64
00:07:23,184 --> 00:07:24,642
Rebecca, are you in there?

65
00:07:24,809 --> 00:07:26,934
Yes, I'm here

66
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,017
Are you insane?

67
00:07:29,184 --> 00:07:32,017
No need to be rude, I'm going

68
00:07:39,017 --> 00:07:43,100
I'll say it again, it is my bathroom

69
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:45,975
And mother's

70
00:07:49,559 --> 00:07:50,850
Are you off?

71
00:07:51,017 --> 00:07:52,100
Yes

72
00:07:52,309 --> 00:07:55,267
On my return, we will discuss...

73
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:57,559
evesdropping

74
00:07:57,725 --> 00:07:59,184
OK

75
00:07:59,767 --> 00:08:00,892
Ok mum?

76
00:08:01,475 --> 00:08:04,142
M. Ocana was buried...

77
00:08:04,309 --> 00:08:05,100
this morning...

78
00:08:05,267 --> 00:08:07,225
What a family!

79
00:08:07,392 --> 00:08:09,350
Dad must be happy

80
00:08:09,517 --> 00:08:10,767
Why?

81
00:08:11,475 --> 00:08:14,142
He did not love Alberto either

82
00:08:14,309 --> 00:08:16,350
The very idea!

83
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:21,600
After the crash, Mr.
Ocana's car caught fire.

84
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:25,017
The driver fell asleep...

85
00:08:25,184 --> 00:08:30,184
the car left the road and struck a tree

86
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:34,975
The health of the Prime
Minister is excellent and...

87
00:08:35,434 --> 00:08:37,850
Why go to Mexico?

88
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:42,975
To work, it is most important now

89
00:08:43,142 --> 00:08:44,559
And the photographs?

90
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:48,434
Let us speak about
filming, not photographs

91
00:08:48,892 --> 00:08:51,225
My husband has just died

92
00:08:51,392 --> 00:08:54,975
I cannot sell these things. Sorry

93
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,309
And if I went to Mexico.

94
00:08:57,684 --> 00:09:01,309
to make a report on filming?

95
00:09:01,475 --> 00:09:03,934
I do not see a problem

96
00:09:06,142 --> 00:09:08,142
You could join me there

97
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,600
Right, fine

98
00:09:12,017 --> 00:09:16,142
If it's an exclusive,
my newspaper will send me

99
00:09:16,309 --> 00:09:17,142
It is

100
00:09:17,309 --> 00:09:18,850
See you in Mexico?

101
00:09:22,725 --> 00:09:26,309
Dad says you're going
without me, you promised

102
00:09:27,017 --> 00:09:28,184
Impossible, darling

103
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:29,350
Why?

104
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,434
Because...

105
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,600
Children do not travel so well

106
00:09:33,767 --> 00:09:35,934
It is necessary to study too

107
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,975
There are schools in Mexico

108
00:09:39,142 --> 00:09:40,184
Right, listen.

109
00:09:40,767 --> 00:09:41,725
You're confusing me!

110
00:09:41,892 --> 00:09:42,934
Sorry, treasure

111
00:09:43,225 --> 00:09:48,142
Let's agree that I go to make
a beautiful film in Mexico.

112
00:09:48,309 --> 00:09:51,809
and afterwards, we'll be
together always, promise

113
00:09:51,975 --> 00:09:53,267
I do not believe you!

114
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,309
Do not promise the impossible

115
00:09:56,475 --> 00:09:58,767
That's it! Deal with it!

116
00:09:58,975 --> 00:10:00,892
But you promised

117
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:06,059
Yes, dear...if Mum doesn't
go, she will be miserable

118
00:10:06,225 --> 00:10:08,017
You don't want that?

119
00:10:10,017 --> 00:10:13,225
Good, leave us, I must speak to Papa

120
00:10:13,392 --> 00:10:15,350
What will I do with her!

121
00:10:15,517 --> 00:10:17,642
You've done enough, leave it to me

122
00:10:31,434 --> 00:10:34,184
Margarita, the guitar!

123
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:35,851
Pardon...

124
00:10:36,059 --> 00:10:37,017
Mother

125
00:10:37,226 --> 00:10:39,184
It is me, Rebecca...

126
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:53,101
Let me look at you

127
00:10:54,642 --> 00:10:56,434
You've become a woman!

128
00:10:56,601 --> 00:10:58,476
Mum, I'm 27

129
00:10:58,684 --> 00:11:03,059
I know, Chanel suits you

130
00:11:03,226 --> 00:11:06,642
It is you who is... ravishing

131
00:11:06,851 --> 00:11:10,434
Wait until I have
rested. And your husband?

132
00:11:10,642 --> 00:11:11,601
He had to go

133
00:11:13,434 --> 00:11:14,309
You will see him

134
00:11:14,517 --> 00:11:18,517
This dumpling who hustled
you, is Margarita, my secretary

135
00:11:19,434 --> 00:11:22,767
Delighted. Your mother's
told me lots about you

136
00:11:22,976 --> 00:11:24,517
- Has she?
- Of course

137
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:30,267
She is a Catalan, daughter of the
famous Dr. Forner, exiled during the war

138
00:11:30,517 --> 00:11:33,601
And my guardian angel for 10 years

139
00:11:33,767 --> 00:11:35,642
What luck!

140
00:11:35,934 --> 00:11:39,934
I'm missing 2 bags, I
leave you the caddie...

141
00:11:42,267 --> 00:11:43,517
Come on, let's get away from the crowd

142
00:11:43,726 --> 00:11:47,559
That's me: always in a crowd!

143
00:11:49,684 --> 00:11:52,517
There's a lot of journalists outside?

144
00:11:52,684 --> 00:11:56,809
Not one, I did not
reveal your date of return

145
00:11:57,184 --> 00:11:59,017
Why? I don't have scabies!

146
00:11:59,851 --> 00:12:01,892
I wanted to avoid the scuffle

147
00:12:02,809 --> 00:12:06,684
It's just
- I'm back after so many years!

148
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,726
I don't often wear this hat!

149
00:12:10,059 --> 00:12:11,684
I expected more interest

150
00:12:12,601 --> 00:12:14,434
I awaited you with much interest

151
00:12:15,517 --> 00:12:17,892
That's true darling, forgive me!

152
00:12:18,476 --> 00:12:20,142
It is the time-lag!

153
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:32,351
Hotel Miguel Angel...

154
00:12:32,517 --> 00:12:33,684
Not our place?

155
00:12:33,851 --> 00:12:38,934
No, I am independent, and
I do not want to disturb you

156
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:41,392
But we'll see a lot of each other?

157
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:43,726
Of course!

158
00:12:44,476 --> 00:12:47,017
My God, how it's changed!

159
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:48,892
You will not recognize...

160
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:53,309
It doesn't matter, as long
as the city recognizes me

161
00:12:53,892 --> 00:12:56,434
Marga, do not take notes

162
00:13:00,351 --> 00:13:01,934
Why was she writing?

163
00:13:02,142 --> 00:13:05,517
Apart from everything else,
she's writing my autobiography.

164
00:13:06,684 --> 00:13:07,892
Am I in it?

165
00:13:08,059 --> 00:13:12,101
Of course, you are my little girl! Why?

166
00:13:12,267 --> 00:13:15,434
I do not like my life read about

167
00:13:16,017 --> 00:13:17,809
Is Manuel in it too?

168
00:13:19,517 --> 00:13:21,142
Let's talk about... Manuel

169
00:13:23,476 --> 00:13:24,976
You married him

170
00:13:25,601 --> 00:13:27,559
and I heard about it by chance

171
00:13:27,726 --> 00:13:29,017
Let us forget that...

172
00:13:31,142 --> 00:13:32,101
You did not tell me

173
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:35,934
I spoke to you about my
marriage on the telephone

174
00:13:36,517 --> 00:13:38,351
Yes, but not with Manuel

175
00:13:38,934 --> 00:13:40,601
I could not!

176
00:13:40,851 --> 00:13:43,851
You told me you were very busy and...

177
00:13:44,017 --> 00:13:45,392
had no time...

178
00:13:47,476 --> 00:13:50,184
I didn't tell you any lies

179
00:13:52,142 --> 00:13:53,642
True, but...

180
00:13:53,976 --> 00:13:55,559
you should have told me

181
00:13:56,892 --> 00:13:57,684
Still!

182
00:14:00,601 --> 00:14:04,684
You can take us along Alamillo Place?

183
00:14:25,642 --> 00:14:27,851
Oh, a turd. It is nothing.

184
00:14:28,017 --> 00:14:29,142
Through the windows...

185
00:14:30,267 --> 00:14:32,809
one could see people's feet

186
00:14:32,976 --> 00:14:35,767
Sometimes that frightened me

187
00:14:36,267 --> 00:14:39,934
I was 5 years old, you
had not been born of course

188
00:14:40,642 --> 00:14:42,809
I bought it, you know?

189
00:14:43,101 --> 00:14:45,642
You thinking of staying in Madrid?

190
00:14:45,809 --> 00:14:48,642
Yes, I will move as soon as possible

191
00:14:48,809 --> 00:14:52,101
Becky, look, it is you!

192
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:53,559
What did she say?

193
00:14:58,642 --> 00:15:01,726
It hardly looks like
me, the photograph here!

194
00:15:01,892 --> 00:15:06,059
I have one with the
same feathers, same pose

195
00:15:06,267 --> 00:15:09,226
"Letal Woman": the true
Becky. Aren't I the true Becky?

196
00:15:09,392 --> 00:15:10,559
Of course!

197
00:15:10,726 --> 00:15:13,392
That's an imposter who imitates you

198
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:16,101
And you thought you were forgotten

199
00:15:16,267 --> 00:15:17,142
You've seen him?

200
00:15:17,309 --> 00:15:22,726
Yes, he's a friend... if I
missed you, I was going to see him

201
00:15:23,226 --> 00:15:25,059
I'll await you over there

202
00:15:25,226 --> 00:15:27,392
Forgive my absence

203
00:15:27,892 --> 00:15:30,642
I do not have an excuse, but...

204
00:15:30,809 --> 00:15:33,351
your father did not help...

205
00:15:33,976 --> 00:15:36,642
I know, Mum, quite the contrary

206
00:15:38,309 --> 00:15:39,309
You...

207
00:15:40,392 --> 00:15:42,101
like me still a little bit?

208
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:46,142
I love you very much

209
00:15:47,851 --> 00:15:49,809
I was afraid that you'd hate me

210
00:15:50,351 --> 00:15:51,559
I did hate you...

211
00:15:52,726 --> 00:15:53,934
but even then...

212
00:15:54,101 --> 00:15:55,809
I still loved you

213
00:16:06,434 --> 00:16:09,226
Ah, I've caught my earring

214
00:16:10,351 --> 00:16:11,851
At last!

215
00:16:19,517 --> 00:16:20,767
You will not believe me!

216
00:16:20,934 --> 00:16:24,601
I had earrings like those

217
00:16:24,767 --> 00:16:28,059
Alberto was alive. I
bought them on an island.

218
00:16:28,809 --> 00:16:30,476
Margarita Island.

219
00:16:30,642 --> 00:16:31,851
You knew?

220
00:16:32,017 --> 00:16:36,059
You bought me these
earrings there the same day

221
00:16:36,267 --> 00:16:40,267
Oh, but of course, what a head I have!

222
00:16:40,434 --> 00:16:42,642
Mum, stop your acting

223
00:16:42,976 --> 00:16:46,726
if not you'll constantly
drop clangers...

224
00:16:46,892 --> 00:16:50,142
The important thing is, we're together

225
00:16:50,351 --> 00:16:52,184
You are right, darling

226
00:16:53,267 --> 00:16:55,059
How grown-up!

227
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:02,517
I am happy, Rebecca is marvellous

228
00:17:02,726 --> 00:17:04,309
I am relieved

229
00:17:04,517 --> 00:17:07,267
Wait, it's still the
hardest thing for you

230
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:09,184
Let me come

231
00:17:09,642 --> 00:17:13,559
I'll go alone. It's 15
years since I saw them

232
00:17:13,767 --> 00:17:14,476
Don't be...

233
00:17:14,684 --> 00:17:16,559
a martyr, Becky

234
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:20,142
I'll try to be kind to her

235
00:17:21,892 --> 00:17:22,809
Look...

236
00:17:23,392 --> 00:17:24,851
She is presenting the news

237
00:17:25,017 --> 00:17:25,851
Let me see...

238
00:17:28,142 --> 00:17:29,309
2 attacks...

239
00:17:29,518 --> 00:17:33,393
were perpetrated this morning by ETA

240
00:17:33,601 --> 00:17:37,809
The 1st led to the death
of Roberto Agalburu...

241
00:17:39,518 --> 00:17:42,518
when a bomb exploded..

242
00:17:42,726 --> 00:17:44,018
under its car

243
00:17:45,393 --> 00:17:48,976
He was a travelling garlic salesman

244
00:17:49,893 --> 00:17:51,268
He was thought to be involved..

245
00:17:51,893 --> 00:17:54,559
with drug trafficking

246
00:17:54,726 --> 00:17:57,476
The attack could have been terrible...

247
00:17:58,393 --> 00:18:00,601
How can she laugh?

248
00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:03,601
...as nearby a creche...

249
00:18:03,976 --> 00:18:05,601
Why am I watching this?

250
00:18:06,393 --> 00:18:07,851
What can I say this evening?

251
00:18:29,518 --> 00:18:30,768
You can go, Lola

252
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:32,059
It's lovely!

253
00:18:32,476 --> 00:18:35,184
Hang on, you saw the news?

254
00:18:35,351 --> 00:18:37,059
Sorry, I forgot

255
00:18:37,226 --> 00:18:42,268
Too bad... I messed it all up
thinking you were looking...

256
00:18:57,059 --> 00:18:58,726
Hi, Manuel?

257
00:19:00,768 --> 00:19:02,434
Beautiful, isn't she?

258
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,726
She's fantastic

259
00:19:11,393 --> 00:19:13,726
Excuse me one moment.

260
00:19:16,601 --> 00:19:20,726
You're happy directing a TV show?

261
00:19:20,934 --> 00:19:23,268
I can't complain

262
00:19:23,643 --> 00:19:26,976
I knew you'd do well

263
00:19:32,101 --> 00:19:34,518
Why didn't you tell
me you'd married her?

264
00:19:34,684 --> 00:19:37,018
She didn't tell me she was your daughter

265
00:19:37,184 --> 00:19:41,018
And you never asked
her about her family?

266
00:19:41,184 --> 00:19:46,268
She told me her father
had died 2 years ago

267
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:47,309
And her mother?

268
00:19:47,934 --> 00:19:51,184
That she might as well be, since she...

269
00:19:51,351 --> 00:19:53,809
lived abroad

270
00:19:53,976 --> 00:19:56,184
You've no excuses

271
00:19:56,351 --> 00:19:57,601
You less than she

272
00:19:58,934 --> 00:20:02,851
But I am not on the
warpath... on the contrary

273
00:20:03,018 --> 00:20:05,559
I want to find my daughter,
to try to make her happy

274
00:20:06,518 --> 00:20:09,351
But that depends on both of us

275
00:20:09,851 --> 00:20:10,934
You love her don't you?

276
00:20:13,476 --> 00:20:14,559
Listen...

277
00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:15,934
Why?

278
00:20:16,684 --> 00:20:17,893
She adores you

279
00:20:18,309 --> 00:20:19,559
She is difficult

280
00:20:19,934 --> 00:20:21,351
Don't I know it!

281
00:20:22,184 --> 00:20:25,559
But you did not answer. Do you love her?

282
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:29,434
When are you performing?

283
00:20:29,809 --> 00:20:31,268
In one month

284
00:20:31,434 --> 00:20:32,684
Of course, TV7

285
00:20:32,851 --> 00:20:34,184
is with you

286
00:20:34,351 --> 00:20:36,434
Thank you, I will need some

287
00:20:37,393 --> 00:20:41,684
This evening is Letal's
last... Are you going?

288
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:44,101
It is late?

289
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:45,809
No, in 1 hour.

290
00:20:45,893 --> 00:20:46,684
A tosser

291
00:20:46,851 --> 00:20:47,934
drag queen?

292
00:20:48,309 --> 00:20:49,601
What a liberal!

293
00:20:49,976 --> 00:20:52,976
I don't like it that
my wife's best friend

294
00:20:53,143 --> 00:20:54,768
is a transvestite...

295
00:20:55,309 --> 00:20:59,976
He is right. It's one
thing is to be modern but...

296
00:21:00,143 --> 00:21:02,476
They live such a sordid life.

297
00:21:02,643 --> 00:21:03,851
Letal is different

298
00:21:04,018 --> 00:21:06,351
Your husband will get jealous

299
00:21:06,726 --> 00:21:08,601
Me? Definately not!

300
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:11,518
It's up to me to be jealous!

301
00:21:15,768 --> 00:21:16,559
Very well...

302
00:21:16,726 --> 00:21:18,184
and very relaxed

303
00:21:18,434 --> 00:21:20,518
No tension

304
00:21:21,726 --> 00:21:23,893
One hour, I think

305
00:21:24,476 --> 00:21:26,976
I am very well, Margarita

306
00:21:32,226 --> 00:21:33,434
A weapon in a show?

307
00:21:35,143 --> 00:21:37,101
Madrid is dangerous

308
00:21:37,309 --> 00:21:42,184
Recently, a transvestite
was killed where we are going

309
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:45,976
Can I go in such a place?

310
00:21:47,018 --> 00:21:47,934
What?

311
00:21:48,101 --> 00:21:51,726
The Rosa Villa is not
a place for your mother

312
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,518
Shall we stay here?

313
00:21:55,351 --> 00:21:58,226
You stay. Me, I'm going!

314
00:21:58,643 --> 00:22:00,101
Let us not discuss it any more!

315
00:22:00,351 --> 00:22:02,476
I've seen a lot worse!

316
00:22:02,643 --> 00:22:04,434
You too, Manuel...

317
00:22:04,601 --> 00:22:05,726
Let's go!

318
00:22:05,934 --> 00:22:07,434
You changed your mind?

319
00:22:07,601 --> 00:22:08,976
I like to change it

320
00:22:25,434 --> 00:22:27,643
Our story is finishing...

321
00:22:29,059 --> 00:22:32,059
and you will regret...

322
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:36,018
ending...

323
00:22:36,643 --> 00:22:39,434
a year of love...

324
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,726
If you go away...

325
00:22:44,101 --> 00:22:47,434
you will soon discover...

326
00:22:48,143 --> 00:22:50,893
that the days are long...

327
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:54,393
and empty without me...

328
00:22:56,351 --> 00:22:58,893
And so the night,

329
00:23:04,268 --> 00:23:07,893
won't feel so lonely...

330
00:23:09,018 --> 00:23:11,851
you will remember...

331
00:23:12,518 --> 00:23:15,768
our happy times together...

332
00:23:16,643 --> 00:23:19,226
you will remember...

333
00:23:20,268 --> 00:23:23,809
the taste of my kisses...

334
00:23:24,143 --> 00:23:27,101
And you will understand...

335
00:23:27,851 --> 00:23:30,726
all at once...

336
00:23:32,268 --> 00:23:35,101
the meaning...

337
00:23:35,851 --> 00:23:38,601
of a year of love...

338
00:23:39,893 --> 00:23:42,393
the meaning...

339
00:23:43,768 --> 00:23:45,768
of a year of love.

340
00:23:49,059 --> 00:23:52,101
You must think about...

341
00:23:52,893 --> 00:23:55,393
what would happen...

342
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:59,809
what you would lose...

343
00:24:00,434 --> 00:24:03,518
how much you would suffer...

344
00:24:04,393 --> 00:24:06,184
If you left now...

345
00:24:07,976 --> 00:24:11,143
you would never find again..

346
00:24:11,518 --> 00:24:14,934
the happy times...

347
00:24:15,143 --> 00:24:18,559
I brought to your life...

348
00:24:20,393 --> 00:24:22,518
And so the night,

349
00:24:28,226 --> 00:24:31,643
won't feel so lonely...

350
00:24:33,018 --> 00:24:35,685
you will remember...

351
00:24:36,685 --> 00:24:40,101
our happy days together...

352
00:24:40,601 --> 00:24:43,143
you will remember...

353
00:24:44,101 --> 00:24:47,685
the taste of my kisses...

354
00:24:48,143 --> 00:24:51,018
And you will understand...

355
00:24:51,851 --> 00:24:54,810
all at once...

356
00:24:56,185 --> 00:24:59,143
the meaning...

357
00:24:59,685 --> 00:25:02,393
of a year of love.

358
00:25:03,393 --> 00:25:06,310
And you will understand...

359
00:25:07,476 --> 00:25:10,226
all at once...

360
00:25:11,435 --> 00:25:14,226
the meaning...

361
00:25:15,018 --> 00:25:18,226
of a year of love...

362
00:25:38,768 --> 00:25:41,060
Did I annoy you?

363
00:25:41,226 --> 00:25:42,226
Why?

364
00:25:42,393 --> 00:25:43,726
The imitation...

365
00:25:43,893 --> 00:25:47,143
It flatters me and makes me feel young

366
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:49,476
Let me look at you

367
00:25:49,726 --> 00:25:52,935
Close up, you don't look like
me, but they are my gestures

368
00:25:53,101 --> 00:25:56,726
I have copied your style,
what makes you unique

369
00:25:56,893 --> 00:25:59,185
I used to be like that but I changed

370
00:25:59,351 --> 00:26:01,976
I cannot sing pop any more

371
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:05,351
I became a lady of song

372
00:26:06,018 --> 00:26:08,185
I know, but I like the old stuff:

373
00:26:08,351 --> 00:26:12,935
the twist, the miniskirt,
your spirit, your style

374
00:26:13,101 --> 00:26:16,810
I don't know whether to
be charmed or insulted

375
00:26:16,976 --> 00:26:17,768
Charmed!

376
00:26:17,851 --> 00:26:19,351
Wonderful!

377
00:26:19,518 --> 00:26:20,851
Forget it, Manuel!

378
00:26:21,851 --> 00:26:25,018
By the way, Letal, this is my husband.

379
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,976
Ah, it is you.

380
00:26:29,393 --> 00:26:30,560
Enchanted

381
00:26:31,518 --> 00:26:33,726
So what is your real name?

382
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:38,643
As the song says...

383
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:42,976
Call me what you like.
My friends call me Letal

384
00:26:45,351 --> 00:26:47,893
Is that male or female?

385
00:26:48,851 --> 00:26:49,976
That depends...

386
00:26:50,518 --> 00:26:52,476
For you, I am a guy

387
00:26:54,185 --> 00:26:55,226
Drink?

388
00:26:55,393 --> 00:26:59,268
No thank you, I've things I must do

389
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:02,810
But I would like a souvenir

390
00:27:02,976 --> 00:27:04,185
An autograph?

391
00:27:04,393 --> 00:27:08,185
No, more personal, your
earrings for example

392
00:27:08,351 --> 00:27:09,726
But, I will be naked!

393
00:27:09,893 --> 00:27:11,476
Mum, give them to him

394
00:27:13,268 --> 00:27:16,018
OK, but give me something...

395
00:27:16,185 --> 00:27:17,601
What you want...

396
00:27:17,768 --> 00:27:19,226
Ask for a falsie

397
00:27:19,643 --> 00:27:21,601
That's it, a falsie...

398
00:27:22,101 --> 00:27:23,435
Which one?

399
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:26,685
The right one, that of the heart...

400
00:27:26,935 --> 00:27:28,351
That's the left

401
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:35,435
Thank you for the earrings, Becky

402
00:27:35,601 --> 00:27:38,393
Thank you for the tit, now I have 3!

403
00:27:39,601 --> 00:27:40,643
Will you help me?

404
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:42,101
Of course

405
00:27:43,351 --> 00:27:44,810
May I?

406
00:27:48,851 --> 00:27:50,935
Help with what?

407
00:27:52,018 --> 00:27:54,476
Manuel, this guy is harmless!

408
00:27:54,643 --> 00:27:58,643
Rebecca never misses an
chance to humiliate me

409
00:27:59,185 --> 00:28:03,393
She recons she has reasons
to be jealous, doesn't she?

410
00:28:04,018 --> 00:28:05,976
You know me.

411
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:08,310
You haven't changed!

412
00:28:08,976 --> 00:28:10,226
You neither

413
00:28:11,476 --> 00:28:13,810
And I'm delighted

414
00:28:13,976 --> 00:28:14,976
I've changed

415
00:28:15,643 --> 00:28:18,310
It doesn't show, but I've matured

416
00:28:18,893 --> 00:28:22,310
Does it remind you of
anything, this song?

417
00:28:22,768 --> 00:28:24,268
Too many things...

418
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:28,143
We didn't finish either of them, eh?

419
00:28:28,476 --> 00:28:32,185
How dare you, Manuel? You insult me!

420
00:28:32,351 --> 00:28:35,310
You never were a conventional woman

421
00:28:35,476 --> 00:28:37,601
What sort of woman was I?

422
00:28:37,768 --> 00:28:40,685
A marvellous woman

423
00:28:42,226 --> 00:28:45,726
For 50 years, I have
been a marvellous woman

424
00:28:45,893 --> 00:28:49,018
I want to be a marvellous person

425
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:51,351
Who says different?

426
00:28:51,518 --> 00:28:54,101
I am the mother of your wife

427
00:28:54,268 --> 00:28:55,768
Not for a long time

428
00:28:57,018 --> 00:28:59,185
I will divorce Rebecca

429
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:02,726
Does she know?

430
00:29:04,435 --> 00:29:06,351
But she doesn't show it

431
00:29:07,851 --> 00:29:08,893
Pass the lip gloss

432
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,518
Anything else?

433
00:29:10,851 --> 00:29:12,518
Yes, the combs

434
00:29:15,185 --> 00:29:16,768
Put them in the bag

435
00:29:19,935 --> 00:29:22,810
Help me with my zip?

436
00:29:27,893 --> 00:29:29,810
You must struggle with that

437
00:29:30,726 --> 00:29:32,893
To be beautiful, one must suffer!

438
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:36,518
I suffer as much
without being beautiful!

439
00:29:37,018 --> 00:29:38,268
It disgusts you...

440
00:29:38,685 --> 00:29:40,393
that I imitate women?

441
00:29:41,018 --> 00:29:45,268
No, I adore that you
imitate my mother...

442
00:29:46,143 --> 00:29:49,060
I would like to be more
than a mother to you

443
00:29:50,893 --> 00:29:52,726
Smooth talker!

444
00:29:56,726 --> 00:29:59,685
Ah, what a cheat...

445
00:29:59,851 --> 00:30:00,976
These hips...

446
00:30:01,185 --> 00:30:03,143
Help me with my stockings?

447
00:30:16,226 --> 00:30:17,268
Hold on...

448
00:30:17,643 --> 00:30:19,685
A beauty spot on your nipple!

449
00:30:19,893 --> 00:30:21,768
It's a birthmark...

450
00:30:29,143 --> 00:30:31,268
My dress!

451
00:30:31,726 --> 00:30:33,101
Let go

452
00:30:43,643 --> 00:30:46,893
Help me, with my heels
I could break my ankle

453
00:30:47,518 --> 00:30:49,226
Open your legs and...

454
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,101
you'll get down easier

455
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:53,893
Leave me alone!

456
00:30:54,393 --> 00:30:55,310
What?

457
00:30:55,476 --> 00:30:57,518
- Open up
- What?

458
00:30:58,601 --> 00:31:01,685
Letal, what are you saying?

459
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,727
Don't tempt me...

460
00:31:36,268 --> 00:31:41,477
because it's four months since I...

461
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,310
Why is she late?

462
00:32:19,727 --> 00:32:21,477
She is unpredictable

463
00:32:21,643 --> 00:32:23,560
She takes after me...

464
00:32:25,977 --> 00:32:27,643
Ah, what a cow!

465
00:32:27,893 --> 00:32:29,393
It was a dream...

466
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,935
Thank you, it is true
that I needed it...

467
00:32:33,435 --> 00:32:35,352
But it will not be repeated

468
00:32:35,518 --> 00:32:36,310
Why?

469
00:32:36,477 --> 00:32:39,018
Because I love my husband

470
00:32:39,185 --> 00:32:40,185
That monster?

471
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,518
Yes,

472
00:32:41,768 --> 00:32:43,435
that monster

473
00:32:43,893 --> 00:32:47,143
I do not know your
name, nor your address

474
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:48,893
That can be arranged

475
00:32:49,143 --> 00:32:51,143
Here is my address

476
00:32:52,602 --> 00:32:54,852
Things are good this way...

477
00:32:55,602 --> 00:32:58,393
Really, don't complicate matters

478
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,143
Shall we meet again?

479
00:33:00,393 --> 00:33:01,477
Who knows?

480
00:33:01,852 --> 00:33:02,685
I'll call you?

481
00:33:03,102 --> 00:33:05,435
No, I prefer to contact you

482
00:33:05,602 --> 00:33:06,393
Where?

483
00:33:06,977 --> 00:33:07,768
Here

484
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:08,935
I will not be here any more

485
00:33:10,518 --> 00:33:12,935
Then, good luck

486
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,643
Are you deaf or what?

487
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:16,768
I am in a hurry

488
00:33:16,935 --> 00:33:21,560
I'm the one in a hurry,
I'm a "working girl", me...

489
00:33:21,727 --> 00:33:23,227
You spoil her

490
00:33:23,685 --> 00:33:25,477
Poor bulls

491
00:33:25,643 --> 00:33:30,643
The notices, nothing interests
me, the weather comes and goes...

492
00:33:30,893 --> 00:33:34,060
Ah, there it is...

493
00:33:34,643 --> 00:33:36,143
Pass the album...

494
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:38,018
on Becky del P ramo...

495
00:33:38,185 --> 00:33:39,143
Yes, mum

496
00:33:39,727 --> 00:33:42,268
"Her first night in Madrid..."

497
00:33:45,935 --> 00:33:47,810
Are we talking about
Bardot or Mother Teresa?

498
00:33:47,977 --> 00:33:49,893
No, only of Becky

499
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:56,060
Thanks... you look pale,
you wouldn't be sick too?

500
00:33:56,227 --> 00:33:58,727
We're both fine

501
00:33:58,893 --> 00:34:00,143
Who knows?

502
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:04,768
With your careless attitude,
you can fool anyone!

503
00:34:05,435 --> 00:34:06,935
Have you had an AIDS test?

504
00:34:07,685 --> 00:34:09,018
Do not start

505
00:34:09,477 --> 00:34:12,852
If you do not do it,
I will... I am tired

506
00:34:13,018 --> 00:34:15,102
Give me those scissors...

507
00:34:15,268 --> 00:34:16,268
darling

508
00:34:18,893 --> 00:34:21,810
First you had leprosy, now AIDS!

509
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:24,393
Do you know what gives you away?

510
00:34:25,102 --> 00:34:27,768
I know that I am burned out

511
00:34:27,935 --> 00:34:29,393
You do not move!

512
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:32,185
Precisely, I need to get well

513
00:34:32,352 --> 00:34:36,685
Come on, give me the glue,
don't look at me that way

514
00:34:36,852 --> 00:34:40,268
I have the right to
know if I am HIV positive

515
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,310
You, I don't know, but me,
I cannot live without knowing

516
00:34:44,518 --> 00:34:46,518
Mum, where is it?

517
00:34:46,685 --> 00:34:49,685
On the tele, give it to me, go on...

518
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,852
The test is at the hospital,

519
00:34:53,018 --> 00:34:56,602
you will have to get up,
then you will find out

520
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:00,477
One day you will regret your cruelty...

521
00:35:00,727 --> 00:35:03,185
and that day will come soon

522
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:05,102
Becky has aged...

523
00:35:06,102 --> 00:35:07,852
Her daughter looks spooky

524
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:46,435
Sancho Manuel's corpse is
stretched out on the bed...

525
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:49,102
showing signs of rigour mortis

526
00:35:49,518 --> 00:35:51,727
Hair dark chestnut

527
00:35:51,893 --> 00:35:53,602
Light chestnut

528
00:35:53,768 --> 00:35:56,102
Light chestnut

529
00:35:56,268 --> 00:35:58,935
He's about about 1.80 m...

530
00:35:59,102 --> 00:36:00,727
A little less, 1,78 m...

531
00:36:00,893 --> 00:36:01,685
More

532
00:36:01,852 --> 00:36:03,227
OK, 1.80 m

533
00:36:03,393 --> 00:36:06,102
Dressed in red silk pyjamas

534
00:36:06,268 --> 00:36:07,352
Satin

535
00:36:07,518 --> 00:36:08,935
Garnet-red satin

536
00:36:09,935 --> 00:36:14,893
He has two holes in the
chest, made by a firearm...

537
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,727
causing death

538
00:36:16,893 --> 00:36:21,560
According to the coroner,
he died between 9 and 11 pm

539
00:36:21,727 --> 00:36:24,435
3 women visited him

540
00:36:24,935 --> 00:36:26,852
One made love to him,

541
00:36:28,018 --> 00:36:30,768
One quarreled with him,

542
00:36:31,893 --> 00:36:34,602
The third found him dead

543
00:36:35,768 --> 00:36:38,185
Did one of you kill him?

544
00:36:44,935 --> 00:36:45,852
Not me

545
00:36:47,727 --> 00:36:48,977
Right, none of you

546
00:36:49,393 --> 00:36:51,018
I want to reverify...

547
00:36:51,227 --> 00:36:54,435
your times of arrival... You, first...

548
00:36:54,643 --> 00:36:55,435
Yes

549
00:36:55,685 --> 00:36:56,810
At what time?

550
00:36:57,602 --> 00:37:00,935
At 8:30, and I left a little after 9

551
00:37:01,143 --> 00:37:02,310
When, precisely?

552
00:37:02,893 --> 00:37:05,227
I don't record these things!

553
00:37:05,685 --> 00:37:06,435
You went there?

554
00:37:07,352 --> 00:37:11,393
Before the news, Manuel
called me to ask me to drop in

555
00:37:11,893 --> 00:37:13,268
And you left?

556
00:37:13,477 --> 00:37:14,310
Yes

557
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:17,977
He promised me a speaking part

558
00:37:18,977 --> 00:37:21,352
I'd had enough of deaf-mutes

559
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,518
People think I'm like
that, but as you see...

560
00:37:25,143 --> 00:37:27,018
What did you do?

561
00:37:27,768 --> 00:37:30,310
I said, we made love

562
00:37:30,977 --> 00:37:33,893
But Manual received a phone call...

563
00:37:34,102 --> 00:37:36,393
and asked me to leave...

564
00:37:36,602 --> 00:37:39,435
I don't like to be treated like that

565
00:37:40,143 --> 00:37:41,768
It was the 1st time?

566
00:37:42,477 --> 00:37:43,227
No...

567
00:37:43,393 --> 00:37:44,768
we did it... err...

568
00:37:46,018 --> 00:37:47,518
We won't listen...

569
00:37:47,685 --> 00:37:49,810
to the sexual exploits
of this young lady

570
00:37:49,977 --> 00:37:52,810
We aren't talking about
someone's love life,

571
00:37:53,518 --> 00:37:57,643
but of a man murdered a
little after having made love

572
00:37:59,268 --> 00:38:03,852
Anyone else? Did you
see anyone else around?

573
00:38:04,477 --> 00:38:08,935
We didn't speak... nor finish

574
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:11,393
Very well

575
00:38:12,143 --> 00:38:12,935
You may go

576
00:38:14,227 --> 00:38:15,477
I'm going...

577
00:38:15,768 --> 00:38:18,102
This is bad publicity for me

578
00:38:19,477 --> 00:38:21,268
There will be no publicity

579
00:38:21,935 --> 00:38:26,227
Because I sing, I dance and I do jazz...

580
00:38:26,518 --> 00:38:30,352
to sleep with a man is one
thing, to kill him is another...

581
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:33,060
I will not trouble you any further

582
00:38:34,019 --> 00:38:37,769
You can, but understand that...

583
00:38:37,935 --> 00:38:40,269
I understand, goodbye

584
00:38:54,185 --> 00:38:57,144
It was you who called him to see him

585
00:38:57,394 --> 00:38:58,435
Yes

586
00:38:58,685 --> 00:39:00,769
I arrived just before 9:30

587
00:39:01,019 --> 00:39:04,310
Why did you stop your rehearsal?

588
00:39:04,769 --> 00:39:05,935
I had to

589
00:39:06,102 --> 00:39:07,394
Why?

590
00:39:09,769 --> 00:39:13,144
It is hard to speak about it
in front of my daughter, judge

591
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:16,352
What I have to say is not new

592
00:39:19,269 --> 00:39:20,727
I did not kill him

593
00:39:22,644 --> 00:39:26,269
One does not kill one's
son-in-law before a premiere!

594
00:39:26,769 --> 00:39:28,727
You believe me, Rebecca?

595
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:31,894
You must convince the judge, not me

596
00:39:32,602 --> 00:39:35,519
Tell me what you spoke about

597
00:39:37,894 --> 00:39:39,352
I wanted us to break up

598
00:39:39,727 --> 00:39:41,602
You were lovers?

599
00:39:42,935 --> 00:39:43,894
Yes

600
00:39:45,144 --> 00:39:48,102
I wanted to put an end to that madness

601
00:39:48,269 --> 00:39:49,769
You knew?

602
00:39:52,685 --> 00:39:56,769
Do not lie! You knew
it or you guessed it

603
00:39:56,935 --> 00:40:01,435
You said nothing to me and I
do not like to imagine things

604
00:40:02,352 --> 00:40:04,727
I've nothing to do with
the failure of your marriage

605
00:40:04,894 --> 00:40:09,269
Nobody's accusing you,
now talk to the judge

606
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:10,810
He's asking the questions

607
00:40:15,935 --> 00:40:18,644
Manuel seduced me, I let it happen

608
00:40:19,019 --> 00:40:22,560
Alas, I was always weak with men

609
00:40:22,894 --> 00:40:25,060
With some, anyway

610
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:29,185
When I found out he was
cheating on me too...

611
00:40:29,352 --> 00:40:32,935
I went to see him to break...

612
00:40:33,435 --> 00:40:34,435
Until when?

613
00:40:36,644 --> 00:40:38,685
I do not know any more...

614
00:40:38,935 --> 00:40:40,519
10 perhaps

615
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:44,352
The taxi will be able to confirm it

616
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:48,310
He told us that you were upset

617
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:53,394
Yes, Manuel had destroyed my
life and that of my daughter!

618
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,519
I would like to leave

619
00:41:01,685 --> 00:41:02,685
OK

620
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:04,560
You can go

621
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:08,435
You can call me at home...

622
00:41:13,352 --> 00:41:16,644
If it wasn't Becky,
it happened afterwards

623
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:18,435
Between 10 and 11

624
00:41:18,602 --> 00:41:19,519
It wasn't her

625
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:21,394
You are sure?

626
00:41:22,269 --> 00:41:26,769
Before a premiere, it would
be bad business to kill someone

627
00:41:26,935 --> 00:41:31,519
Especially one's son-in-law...
it's a good argument

628
00:41:31,685 --> 00:41:35,227
You said you arrived at 11

629
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,560
The sprinkler doesn't
operate before then

630
00:41:39,977 --> 00:41:44,435
Your husband was alone in the house

631
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:45,560
No-one else

632
00:41:45,727 --> 00:41:46,769
Why?

633
00:41:47,644 --> 00:41:50,519
There was a violent
argument, in the morning

634
00:41:51,185 --> 00:41:54,644
He wanted a divorce and I had refused

635
00:41:55,727 --> 00:41:58,935
He threatened to leave
me, and I to commit suicide

636
00:41:59,644 --> 00:42:00,602
He left?

637
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:03,394
Yes, he wanted to be alone

638
00:42:03,727 --> 00:42:05,852
I promised to leave him

639
00:42:06,019 --> 00:42:07,977
- You went there?
- Of course

640
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:13,060
I returned after the news

641
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,769
I was after my tranquillizers

642
00:42:17,935 --> 00:42:20,644
They were not in their place

643
00:42:21,644 --> 00:42:25,394
I supposed that Manuel
had removed them...

644
00:42:25,727 --> 00:42:27,894
fearing I'd do something stupid

645
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:31,602
Under this pretext, I went to see him

646
00:42:33,477 --> 00:42:34,644
Try...

647
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:38,602
to describe accurately your arrival

648
00:42:39,227 --> 00:42:41,019
Remember...

649
00:42:41,894 --> 00:42:44,977
all that you saw, heard

650
00:42:46,019 --> 00:42:47,602
There was wind...

651
00:42:48,519 --> 00:42:51,060
in the leaves of the trees

652
00:42:52,477 --> 00:42:54,852
I can still hear the noise

653
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,560
When I entered...

654
00:43:00,394 --> 00:43:05,519
it was dark, I did not want
to show my tears to Manuel

655
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:08,894
I sat in an armchair

656
00:43:09,935 --> 00:43:12,019
Manuel had his back to me

657
00:43:12,852 --> 00:43:15,519
I could not see well

658
00:43:16,769 --> 00:43:21,894
I asked him for forgiveness
for the argument in the morning

659
00:43:22,727 --> 00:43:26,560
I said that I would
grant him a divorce...

660
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:30,019
that I would manage

661
00:43:31,352 --> 00:43:33,060
He did not answer

662
00:43:36,269 --> 00:43:38,519
I thought that he was angry

663
00:43:39,227 --> 00:43:43,519
I had decided to take
my pills on the table

664
00:43:43,894 --> 00:43:46,560
I approached the bed

665
00:43:47,519 --> 00:43:50,602
I must have been blind not to see...

666
00:43:51,102 --> 00:43:53,852
I just thought he was angry...

667
00:43:54,144 --> 00:43:56,977
I cried because of his hardness

668
00:43:58,435 --> 00:44:02,352
I took the pills and
I was going to leave...

669
00:44:03,977 --> 00:44:05,685
but I returned...

670
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:09,644
I could not leave like that...

671
00:44:11,685 --> 00:44:13,894
Once on the bed,

672
00:44:14,102 --> 00:44:16,144
I rubbed myself against him,

673
00:44:16,977 --> 00:44:18,935
I cuddled him...

674
00:44:21,227 --> 00:44:23,435
but he did not react

675
00:44:24,727 --> 00:44:27,810
And then I realized...

676
00:44:28,019 --> 00:44:32,144
that my hands and dress
were covered with blood

677
00:44:32,977 --> 00:44:35,852
Why wait until this morning?

678
00:44:37,894 --> 00:44:40,019
I really do not know

679
00:44:40,519 --> 00:44:41,894
What did you do?

680
00:44:42,852 --> 00:44:45,310
I went back to the house...

681
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:49,185
I could not reconcile
myself with his death

682
00:44:49,894 --> 00:44:52,894
And I don't give a damn about dying

683
00:44:53,727 --> 00:44:56,185
I swallowed a stomachful of pills...

684
00:44:56,602 --> 00:45:00,185
but I brought them up again at once...

685
00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:04,852
The morning, I called the police

686
00:45:56,394 --> 00:45:58,811
- for the photographs?
- Yes

687
00:46:03,977 --> 00:46:07,477
Let us see, these are yours

688
00:46:08,186 --> 00:46:08,977
And these

689
00:46:14,769 --> 00:46:15,602
An armchair

690
00:46:18,186 --> 00:46:20,061
It is your armchair?

691
00:46:20,227 --> 00:46:21,019
Yes

692
00:46:22,186 --> 00:46:26,061
They are mine, they were mixed up

693
00:46:26,227 --> 00:46:28,061
This face looks familiar

694
00:46:29,352 --> 00:46:31,852
He was my fiance

695
00:46:32,436 --> 00:46:34,977
He disappeared, did you know him?

696
00:46:36,727 --> 00:46:37,936
You know where he is?

697
00:47:19,811 --> 00:47:21,602
Good evening

698
00:47:33,811 --> 00:47:36,311
Rebecca, my condolences

699
00:47:36,477 --> 00:47:37,269
Thank you

700
00:47:37,436 --> 00:47:38,811
Mine too

701
00:47:38,977 --> 00:47:39,936
Thank you

702
00:47:40,102 --> 00:47:40,852
We thought you'd take

703
00:47:41,019 --> 00:47:42,936
a holiday

704
00:47:43,102 --> 00:47:45,144
Work will distract me

705
00:47:45,311 --> 00:47:46,311
Of course...

706
00:47:49,394 --> 00:47:50,852
Rebecca!

707
00:47:51,227 --> 00:47:52,352
You are here!

708
00:47:52,936 --> 00:47:55,394
Eh yes, as you see

709
00:48:00,727 --> 00:48:02,727
The usual?

710
00:48:03,769 --> 00:48:05,602
No, more

711
00:48:14,394 --> 00:48:17,769
If you need anything, Rebecca

712
00:48:19,852 --> 00:48:22,019
Rebeca, I feel bad

713
00:48:22,186 --> 00:48:23,686
Don't

714
00:48:23,852 --> 00:48:25,644
I'm sorry and...

715
00:48:25,811 --> 00:48:29,394
It's not your problem...
You don't have to worry

716
00:48:29,561 --> 00:48:32,144
OK, but I wanted to say it

717
00:48:32,644 --> 00:48:34,311
Be prepared

718
00:48:34,477 --> 00:48:36,477
What's she doing?

719
00:48:36,977 --> 00:48:38,811
Are you testing the sound?

720
00:48:39,269 --> 00:48:40,102
Yes

721
00:48:43,477 --> 00:48:45,811
Good evening. The
Agricultural Demonstrations

722
00:48:45,977 --> 00:48:49,227
A great quantity of corn was thrown...

723
00:48:49,811 --> 00:48:54,561
by the farmers in front
of the U.S. embassy

724
00:48:55,852 --> 00:48:59,644
It is the agricultural
organization "PIENSO" that...

725
00:48:59,811 --> 00:49:03,394
organised this demonstration. Yes?

726
00:49:23,269 --> 00:49:26,019
Good evening... The
Agricultural Demonstrations...

727
00:49:26,186 --> 00:49:27,644
Corn...

728
00:49:27,811 --> 00:49:29,852
this morning was thrown...

729
00:49:30,019 --> 00:49:32,686
How can she work?

730
00:49:34,186 --> 00:49:38,561
The agricultural
organization "PIENSO"...

731
00:49:38,727 --> 00:49:43,852
demonstrates thus against
American corn importation,

732
00:49:44,019 --> 00:49:46,936
because Spain is increasing its quotas

733
00:49:49,852 --> 00:49:54,811
This afternoon, Manuel
Sancho Bermejo was buried,

734
00:49:55,019 --> 00:49:57,144
assassinated 3 days ago...

735
00:49:57,519 --> 00:50:01,977
between 9 and 11 in the
evening, in his country house

736
00:50:04,144 --> 00:50:08,102
Dedicated as always to communication,

737
00:50:08,269 --> 00:50:12,144
he was directing TV7
at the time of its death

738
00:50:12,311 --> 00:50:15,852
Various celebrities from the show...

739
00:50:16,019 --> 00:50:21,352
as well as family and friends
rendered a last homage to Manuel

740
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:25,394
Forgive my familiarity...

741
00:50:25,561 --> 00:50:28,186
he directed this series and...

742
00:50:28,352 --> 00:50:30,519
was also my husband

743
00:50:30,811 --> 00:50:31,686
Cut, if...

744
00:50:31,852 --> 00:50:32,644
Manuel...

745
00:50:32,936 --> 00:50:36,227
had lately received death threats

746
00:50:36,852 --> 00:50:40,769
Unfortunately, he took no notice

747
00:50:40,936 --> 00:50:42,394
Prepare the next

748
00:50:42,561 --> 00:50:44,394
One day he asked me:

749
00:50:45,644 --> 00:50:49,769
If he gave me something,
would I say it on TV7?

750
00:50:51,019 --> 00:50:53,602
I answered no

751
00:50:54,977 --> 00:50:57,394
Well Manual, here I am...

752
00:50:58,602 --> 00:51:00,144
I'm tryimg to do it

753
00:51:05,019 --> 00:51:08,394
Judge Dominguez is running
the investigation...

754
00:51:08,561 --> 00:51:12,352
and is right off track at the moment

755
00:51:12,602 --> 00:51:16,061
According to the autopsy, the victim...

756
00:51:16,644 --> 00:51:19,227
had just made love...

757
00:51:20,561 --> 00:51:22,977
But it was not with me

758
00:51:23,144 --> 00:51:25,102
If you continue, I'm leaving

759
00:51:27,477 --> 00:51:30,686
At 11, this Thursday,
I went over there...

760
00:51:31,102 --> 00:51:33,102
I found his corpse

761
00:51:34,144 --> 00:51:35,686
Wait!

762
00:51:35,852 --> 00:51:36,644
Do not cut!

763
00:51:36,811 --> 00:51:39,477
And I know who committed the crime

764
00:51:43,311 --> 00:51:44,686
It is I

765
00:51:44,852 --> 00:51:46,144
I killed him

766
00:51:47,352 --> 00:51:48,977
She killed him!

767
00:51:49,352 --> 00:51:50,311
Rebecca...

768
00:51:50,602 --> 00:51:52,186
Judge Dominguez...

769
00:51:52,936 --> 00:51:57,311
Go immediately to TV7
and arrest Rebecca Giner

770
00:51:59,602 --> 00:52:01,811
As for the gun...

771
00:52:02,644 --> 00:52:04,436
I had to throw it

772
00:52:04,727 --> 00:52:07,602
I do not remember too well

773
00:52:09,019 --> 00:52:11,227
Yes, I returned...

774
00:52:11,602 --> 00:52:14,436
and I was overcome

775
00:52:15,269 --> 00:52:18,019
I could not call anybody,

776
00:52:18,186 --> 00:52:19,852
nor knew what to do

777
00:52:20,186 --> 00:52:23,102
I was never going to see Manuel again...

778
00:52:23,311 --> 00:52:26,394
and that made me suffer dreadfully

779
00:52:29,644 --> 00:52:32,269
I don't know why,

780
00:52:32,853 --> 00:52:35,353
to fight this anguish,

781
00:52:35,853 --> 00:52:39,019
I started to photograph...

782
00:52:39,353 --> 00:52:41,811
our common memories:

783
00:52:46,853 --> 00:52:49,519
his office...

784
00:52:50,103 --> 00:52:53,436
with his papers, neatly arranged,

785
00:52:54,894 --> 00:52:56,936
his sports bag,

786
00:53:00,769 --> 00:53:01,853
His bed,

787
00:53:04,103 --> 00:53:05,353
His dressing gown,

788
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:11,644
His cupboard with his costumes,

789
00:53:16,561 --> 00:53:19,894
His armchair from where
he watched me on the TV...

790
00:53:22,644 --> 00:53:25,894
I even photographed
some ravishing clothes

791
00:53:26,269 --> 00:53:28,811
that I had just bought...

792
00:53:30,978 --> 00:53:33,644
and now useless

793
00:53:34,811 --> 00:53:38,436
Then I realized that I was alone...

794
00:53:39,186 --> 00:53:42,894
and that while I had killedManuel,
I had not killed my love for him

795
00:53:44,519 --> 00:53:45,728
Madam...

796
00:53:47,144 --> 00:53:48,519
Come with us!

797
00:53:52,769 --> 00:53:55,728
Wait, I haven't finished

798
00:53:58,769 --> 00:54:00,228
That is all

799
00:54:02,061 --> 00:54:02,978
Remember...

800
00:54:03,144 --> 00:54:05,019
that at 20:30...

801
00:54:05,228 --> 00:54:08,519
in the 2nd edition of
the News, you will see...

802
00:54:08,686 --> 00:54:12,228
the latest news in draft form

803
00:54:13,353 --> 00:54:17,478
As always, thank you for watching...

804
00:54:19,019 --> 00:54:20,144
and goodbye

805
00:54:26,603 --> 00:54:28,353
Sorry, Xavier...

806
00:54:36,436 --> 00:54:38,394
You have the right to remain silent...

807
00:54:38,561 --> 00:54:42,269
and not to incriminate yourself

808
00:54:42,436 --> 00:54:43,728
You have the right...

809
00:54:43,894 --> 00:54:48,894
to a lawyer

810
00:54:49,061 --> 00:54:52,853
You may inform whoever...

811
00:54:53,019 --> 00:54:57,103
of the fact and of the
place of your detention

812
00:55:27,728 --> 00:55:28,769
Enter

813
00:55:31,519 --> 00:55:34,769
The next time, pay
attention to the weapon

814
00:55:35,103 --> 00:55:36,394
Sit down

815
00:55:37,644 --> 00:55:39,394
Why not tell me?

816
00:55:39,561 --> 00:55:42,853
Why on television?

817
00:55:43,311 --> 00:55:44,228
So what?

818
00:55:44,394 --> 00:55:45,811
I admitted it, didn't I?

819
00:55:45,978 --> 00:55:47,644
That is not enough...

820
00:55:47,811 --> 00:55:49,769
It is not so easy to be guilty

821
00:55:49,936 --> 00:55:51,644
Proof is required

822
00:55:52,519 --> 00:55:53,353
Look for it!

823
00:55:55,186 --> 00:55:57,269
And you will help us

824
00:55:57,478 --> 00:56:00,728
If you decide to tell the truth!

825
00:56:01,478 --> 00:56:02,853
I have just done it

826
00:56:03,061 --> 00:56:04,353
When?

827
00:56:06,853 --> 00:56:09,519
You have two versions

828
00:56:09,686 --> 00:56:13,186
One here this morning,
and one on television

829
00:56:13,894 --> 00:56:15,769
Which should I believe?

830
00:56:16,186 --> 00:56:18,061
Which is true?

831
00:56:18,269 --> 00:56:19,269
Both

832
00:56:20,978 --> 00:56:22,103
Both?

833
00:56:25,478 --> 00:56:26,769
This morning, you...

834
00:56:27,353 --> 00:56:29,186
were looking for pills...

835
00:56:29,353 --> 00:56:31,186
without mentioning the revolver...

836
00:56:31,478 --> 00:56:33,394
and that is significant

837
00:56:33,561 --> 00:56:36,894
The revolver was beside the pills,

838
00:56:37,186 --> 00:56:38,186
it was Manuel's

839
00:56:38,769 --> 00:56:40,436
What did you do with it?

840
00:56:44,061 --> 00:56:45,269
Come!

841
00:56:49,894 --> 00:56:51,603
Take off her handcuffs

842
00:57:01,644 --> 00:57:05,061
To help you, I need you

843
00:57:05,686 --> 00:57:06,603
To help me? Why?

844
00:57:06,769 --> 00:57:09,686
You had no need to kill him

845
00:57:10,311 --> 00:57:13,394
You had to only divorce...

846
00:57:14,686 --> 00:57:18,311
OK, let us suppose
that you did not do it

847
00:57:19,478 --> 00:57:21,436
And these death threats?

848
00:57:21,603 --> 00:57:23,811
These anonymous messages?

849
00:57:24,478 --> 00:57:26,061
Manuel couldn't give a fuck

850
00:57:26,644 --> 00:57:28,186
Who was the author?

851
00:57:28,936 --> 00:57:30,519
Yes... Me

852
00:57:30,978 --> 00:57:32,103
Shit!

853
00:57:33,353 --> 00:57:35,603
Let us suppose that it was not you...

854
00:57:36,811 --> 00:57:39,436
Who could want his death?

855
00:57:41,436 --> 00:57:42,728
I do not see...

856
00:57:44,019 --> 00:57:45,353
Forgive me...

857
00:57:45,519 --> 00:57:47,061
you have a lover?

858
00:57:47,561 --> 00:57:48,561
Does that concern you?

859
00:57:49,103 --> 00:57:51,061
Yes, it is my inquiry

860
00:57:51,936 --> 00:57:53,603
No, I do not have one

861
00:57:54,686 --> 00:57:56,186
Never unfaithful?

862
00:57:57,978 --> 00:57:59,436
Never once?

863
00:58:00,061 --> 00:58:01,186
No!

864
00:58:03,103 --> 00:58:04,311
That's a lie

865
00:58:04,811 --> 00:58:05,644
Oh yeah?

866
00:58:07,978 --> 00:58:11,061
When your mother returned,
to the Villa Rosa,

867
00:58:11,561 --> 00:58:14,978
you misled your husband
right under his nose

868
00:58:17,394 --> 00:58:18,436
How do you know?

869
00:58:18,853 --> 00:58:21,728
Who are you trying to protect?

870
00:58:22,061 --> 00:58:22,978
Nobody

871
00:58:23,644 --> 00:58:25,103
Anything to add?

872
00:58:28,561 --> 00:58:29,603
OK,

873
00:58:30,019 --> 00:58:32,019
then, it is prison

874
00:58:33,644 --> 00:58:36,644
You can telephone

875
00:58:36,853 --> 00:58:39,311
You need clothes and...

876
00:58:39,686 --> 00:58:41,686
a lawyer... apart from anything else

877
01:00:37,145 --> 01:00:39,186
Good evening, Madrid

878
01:00:40,395 --> 01:00:42,770
It was hard to get here...

879
01:00:43,603 --> 01:00:45,353
but I am happy

880
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:49,520
This evening,

881
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:53,395
my only daughter sleeps in prison

882
01:00:54,353 --> 01:00:56,853
It little matters what she did,

883
01:00:57,770 --> 01:01:01,145
like all mothers, my heart is broken

884
01:01:03,811 --> 01:01:07,520
Allow me to dedicate
to her my first song

885
01:01:37,436 --> 01:01:41,811
If your sorrow is heavy,

886
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:45,020
think of me,

887
01:01:48,853 --> 01:01:52,770
if you want to cry,

888
01:01:53,936 --> 01:01:56,520
think of me

889
01:02:00,270 --> 01:02:02,270
You can clearly see...

890
01:02:02,853 --> 01:02:07,686
that I adore your divine face,

891
01:02:10,395 --> 01:02:13,145
your child's mouth...

892
01:02:13,311 --> 01:02:18,853
that taught me to sin...

893
01:02:23,020 --> 01:02:25,645
Think of me...

894
01:02:29,020 --> 01:02:32,353
when you suffer,

895
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:38,270
when you cry,

896
01:02:38,936 --> 01:02:43,103
also think of me

897
01:02:49,853 --> 01:02:52,311
That's your mother, it
is beautiful, isn't it?

898
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:53,520
Stop

899
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:54,811
Why?

900
01:02:56,645 --> 01:02:57,478
I cannot

901
01:02:57,686 --> 01:02:58,770
The poor thing

902
01:02:58,936 --> 01:03:01,145
Close your ears!

903
01:03:01,811 --> 01:03:02,603
Luisa!

904
01:03:03,978 --> 01:03:05,270
I'll buy it from you

905
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:06,603
10,000 pesetos

906
01:03:06,978 --> 01:03:08,686
It cost me 15000!

907
01:03:09,936 --> 01:03:11,186
17,000, sorry

908
01:03:12,020 --> 01:03:16,186
I've just been robbed, I
will give them to you tomorrow

909
01:03:16,895 --> 01:03:19,270
We will see tomorrow, then

910
01:03:19,853 --> 01:03:22,520
Sorry, but it is her's

911
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:30,061
When you cry

912
01:03:31,186 --> 01:03:32,561
why...

913
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:36,186
think of me

914
01:03:39,978 --> 01:03:42,061
When you want...

915
01:03:42,936 --> 01:03:48,145
to capture my life

916
01:03:51,853 --> 01:03:54,061
I do not want to any more

917
01:03:54,645 --> 01:03:56,520
It's nothing...

918
01:03:57,645 --> 01:04:02,353
it's no good for me...

919
01:04:03,436 --> 01:04:05,520
without you

920
01:05:34,770 --> 01:05:39,436
Hello, Paula will
take you to the nursery

921
01:05:39,603 --> 01:05:42,145
Clotilde is sick

922
01:05:42,311 --> 01:05:43,770
Hello, Myriam

923
01:05:51,978 --> 01:05:55,895
My name is Paula, I
am a welfare officer,

924
01:05:56,061 --> 01:05:58,645
I am here to help you

925
01:05:59,603 --> 01:06:01,145
We know each other...

926
01:06:01,770 --> 01:06:02,895
you remember?

927
01:06:04,436 --> 01:06:05,686
At the photographer's...

928
01:06:07,686 --> 01:06:12,395
I was moved when you showed
photographs on the tele

929
01:06:12,686 --> 01:06:16,520
I photograph things too...
I understood you so well

930
01:06:16,853 --> 01:06:20,478
When you took them out of your bag...

931
01:06:20,645 --> 01:06:24,603
commenting on them, I started to cry

932
01:06:24,770 --> 01:06:25,561
Me too

933
01:06:25,728 --> 01:06:27,353
Yes, I saw

934
01:06:28,020 --> 01:06:32,937
Listen, I'm pressed for time
here, I cannot speak, but...

935
01:06:33,103 --> 01:06:34,812
if I can help you...

936
01:06:34,978 --> 01:06:37,728
I need sleeping pills...

937
01:06:38,478 --> 01:06:40,020
- sleeping pills?
- Yes

938
01:06:41,103 --> 01:06:43,562
We'll see...

939
01:06:47,645 --> 01:06:49,937
You're concerned about Rebecca...

940
01:06:50,187 --> 01:06:51,895
so, I made inquires

941
01:06:52,062 --> 01:06:53,937
No point, mum

942
01:06:54,145 --> 01:06:55,937
I will speak to her mother

943
01:06:56,145 --> 01:06:57,770
She is hiding something

944
01:06:57,978 --> 01:07:00,187
That, I well know

945
01:07:00,353 --> 01:07:01,520
Look at that

946
01:07:02,978 --> 01:07:04,020
You recognize him?

947
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:06,145
It's the dead man

948
01:07:06,812 --> 01:07:09,270
Formerly, he was the mother's lover

949
01:07:09,478 --> 01:07:12,020
Look, there...

950
01:07:31,978 --> 01:07:32,895
Who is that?

951
01:07:33,145 --> 01:07:34,478
Judge Dominguez

952
01:07:34,645 --> 01:07:35,478
Enter

953
01:07:46,937 --> 01:07:49,520
Astonished that I live in a basement?

954
01:07:49,687 --> 01:07:51,437
To tell the truth, yes

955
01:07:51,728 --> 01:07:53,812
My parents were in digs

956
01:07:53,978 --> 01:07:55,437
I was born here

957
01:07:55,603 --> 01:07:57,728
Why return so much later?

958
01:07:58,103 --> 01:07:59,937
It is difficult to say

959
01:08:00,187 --> 01:08:01,728
Thank you, put that there

960
01:08:02,145 --> 01:08:04,978
I ran out of time the 1st year

961
01:08:05,145 --> 01:08:08,645
And then 15 years
passed... A little tea?

962
01:08:08,812 --> 01:08:13,478
Thank you... my mother knows
the same type of inertia

963
01:08:13,645 --> 01:08:14,895
She's an artist?

964
01:08:15,062 --> 01:08:17,062
Something like that

965
01:08:17,395 --> 01:08:20,520
She is sorry about your
daughter and your son-in-law

966
01:08:25,062 --> 01:08:25,937
When did you meet him?

967
01:08:26,853 --> 01:08:27,645
Who?

968
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:30,603
Manuel... on your return?

969
01:08:31,312 --> 01:08:32,228
Yes

970
01:08:32,853 --> 01:08:36,770
I was invited to the
wedding but I could not go

971
01:08:41,228 --> 01:08:41,978
Recognize anyone?

972
01:08:45,270 --> 01:08:46,728
That's despicable!

973
01:08:47,270 --> 01:08:49,062
Answer me

974
01:08:49,437 --> 01:08:50,353
Yes...

975
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:51,687
I recognize us

976
01:08:52,312 --> 01:08:53,937
It's been a long time...

977
01:08:54,103 --> 01:08:58,312
Manuel made a living from
the artists he interviewed...

978
01:08:58,562 --> 01:08:59,437
Me included

979
01:09:01,937 --> 01:09:02,895
You lied?

980
01:09:04,645 --> 01:09:06,478
I have the right to forget

981
01:09:06,812 --> 01:09:08,978
You speak like a guilty person

982
01:09:09,187 --> 01:09:10,437
I am not one

983
01:09:10,937 --> 01:09:12,437
You are thinking of your daughter?

984
01:09:12,937 --> 01:09:14,603
I am not thinking of anything

985
01:09:14,853 --> 01:09:16,937
I am suffering too much to think

986
01:09:17,687 --> 01:09:18,937
This will astonish you...

987
01:09:19,103 --> 01:09:20,270
I want to help you

988
01:09:21,312 --> 01:09:22,937
Help who?

989
01:09:23,145 --> 01:09:24,145
Not me...

990
01:09:24,312 --> 01:09:25,145
You are free

991
01:09:26,020 --> 01:09:28,353
Prison would not be worse...

992
01:09:29,145 --> 01:09:32,187
And if you want to help Rebecca...

993
01:09:32,937 --> 01:09:35,937
remember that she confessed

994
01:09:37,728 --> 01:09:41,187
I do not believe that
she told everything

995
01:09:41,353 --> 01:09:43,353
She said enough!

996
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:45,603
You could speak to her

997
01:09:47,478 --> 01:09:49,187
She will not lie you

998
01:09:49,353 --> 01:09:50,395
You're dreaming!

999
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:53,895
You are not anxious for her?

1000
01:09:54,353 --> 01:09:56,437
Of course I am!

1001
01:09:56,603 --> 01:09:57,812
Why do you not want to see her?

1002
01:09:57,978 --> 01:10:02,103
I neither want to speak to
her, nor to reopen my wounds

1003
01:10:02,895 --> 01:10:06,770
I could help you avoid bureaucracy...

1004
01:10:06,937 --> 01:10:08,978
and go to the prison

1005
01:10:10,728 --> 01:10:11,853
Thank you

1006
01:10:13,478 --> 01:10:15,603
But I am afraid of Rebecca

1007
01:10:16,478 --> 01:10:19,062
Fear of having to face her

1008
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:22,728
Every morning...

1009
01:10:23,103 --> 01:10:26,020
my only desire is to
get through to evening

1010
01:10:26,353 --> 01:10:28,770
to do what I know how to do:

1011
01:10:29,478 --> 01:10:30,562
to perform...

1012
01:10:33,228 --> 01:10:35,520
I cannot do more

1013
01:10:37,353 --> 01:10:39,562
OK, leave me alone

1014
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:45,812
I would like to keep the clipping

1015
01:10:46,978 --> 01:10:48,770
I must return it...

1016
01:10:49,187 --> 01:10:50,103
Leave!

1017
01:12:16,770 --> 01:12:17,978
She is beautiful!

1018
01:12:18,145 --> 01:12:19,187
She was arrested with me...

1019
01:12:19,770 --> 01:12:20,770
She is a whore

1020
01:12:20,937 --> 01:12:24,103
She tossed a brick at a
cop to join her girlfriend

1021
01:12:24,270 --> 01:12:26,020
She's got guts...

1022
01:12:26,187 --> 01:12:29,687
Hang on, sleeping pills...

1023
01:13:29,229 --> 01:13:31,270
You are stoned!

1024
01:13:31,437 --> 01:13:33,270
Useless to shout it!

1025
01:13:34,645 --> 01:13:37,270
I told you not to sell to her! Bitch!

1026
01:13:38,062 --> 01:13:39,604
Shit, stop!

1027
01:13:40,187 --> 01:13:41,479
I will kill you!

1028
01:13:45,729 --> 01:13:48,770
Why did I almost kill this guy?

1029
01:13:48,937 --> 01:13:50,479
Just to see you!

1030
01:13:57,354 --> 01:13:58,770
Who's is this blouson?

1031
01:13:58,937 --> 01:14:00,395
Mine of course

1032
01:14:00,562 --> 01:14:03,145
Can I see something?

1033
01:14:03,770 --> 01:14:04,729
Let go!

1034
01:14:04,895 --> 01:14:08,937
You're lying I bought
this for my boyfriend

1035
01:14:09,312 --> 01:14:10,687
- It is mine
- Yours?

1036
01:14:10,854 --> 01:14:13,729
Ok, you can keep it...
but where did you get it?

1037
01:14:13,895 --> 01:14:17,395
On a stiff, we shared out his stuff

1038
01:14:17,562 --> 01:14:19,729
A dead man? Are you sure?

1039
01:14:19,895 --> 01:14:23,354
The person I'm talking
about, was a grass

1040
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:25,104
Hugo, a grass?

1041
01:14:26,604 --> 01:14:30,312
He was a dealer, you weren't
friendly with this son of whore?

1042
01:14:30,479 --> 01:14:33,604
He was not a son of
whore, leave me alone!

1043
01:14:38,020 --> 01:14:39,187
Cool it

1044
01:14:40,270 --> 01:14:41,895
Listen, look at this

1045
01:14:45,812 --> 01:14:46,895
It is him?

1046
01:14:47,395 --> 01:14:48,229
Yes

1047
01:14:48,437 --> 01:14:49,520
- Sure?
- He's bad news...

1048
01:14:49,729 --> 01:14:52,020
- So?
- Let me go

1049
01:14:53,604 --> 01:14:54,812
What's happening?

1050
01:14:57,854 --> 01:14:59,812
My boyfriend is dead

1051
01:14:59,979 --> 01:15:01,937
I am sorry

1052
01:15:03,562 --> 01:15:04,687
Is this him?

1053
01:15:06,979 --> 01:15:08,270
She told you that?

1054
01:15:09,104 --> 01:15:11,729
I bought him the red blouson

1055
01:15:12,020 --> 01:15:15,687
If I were you, I would
get more information

1056
01:15:15,854 --> 01:15:19,687
We lived together just a few months

1057
01:15:19,937 --> 01:15:22,979
He left time and again, like all junkies

1058
01:15:23,145 --> 01:15:24,020
He was one?

1059
01:15:24,187 --> 01:15:25,479
Yes

1060
01:15:25,979 --> 01:15:28,520
I tried to help him

1061
01:15:29,312 --> 01:15:32,937
Although I loved him, I
wouldn't let him lie to me

1062
01:15:33,395 --> 01:15:36,770
One day, I said to him: "just go!"

1063
01:15:37,354 --> 01:15:39,187
He never returned

1064
01:15:40,062 --> 01:15:41,104
And these photographs?

1065
01:15:41,270 --> 01:15:42,604
From then on

1066
01:15:43,270 --> 01:15:48,020
When I'm blue, I photograph
what he left behind:

1067
01:15:48,187 --> 01:15:50,520
The photographs... look, his cock

1068
01:15:51,020 --> 01:15:53,020
A beauty spot on the nipple?

1069
01:15:55,687 --> 01:15:57,437
Do not study his head...

1070
01:15:57,604 --> 01:16:00,020
What counts, is the tail...

1071
01:16:01,604 --> 01:16:04,895
And she told me he was a grass

1072
01:16:05,062 --> 01:16:06,020
You believe it?

1073
01:16:06,187 --> 01:16:09,604
Many junkies are, you know...

1074
01:16:10,354 --> 01:16:12,062
And I remember...

1075
01:16:12,229 --> 01:16:16,020
Hugo questioned me a
lot about the prison

1076
01:16:16,187 --> 01:16:19,770
Rebecca Giner, come to the gates

1077
01:16:20,062 --> 01:16:21,354
Go ahead, Rebecca!

1078
01:17:09,645 --> 01:17:11,437
Remove her handcuffs

1079
01:17:13,687 --> 01:17:15,062
How is that?

1080
01:17:18,437 --> 01:17:19,645
Ready to talk?

1081
01:17:19,812 --> 01:17:20,562
About what?

1082
01:17:20,729 --> 01:17:23,062
Letal, I must find him

1083
01:17:23,229 --> 01:17:25,062
More jokes, Judge!

1084
01:17:25,687 --> 01:17:26,812
He's your grass

1085
01:17:26,979 --> 01:17:28,020
Untrue

1086
01:17:28,187 --> 01:17:32,312
Who told you we'd fucked? Nobody else

1087
01:17:32,479 --> 01:17:35,229
Tell me where he lives lives

1088
01:17:35,395 --> 01:17:36,520
I've no idea

1089
01:17:36,687 --> 01:17:38,770
I saw him at the Villa Rosa

1090
01:17:40,104 --> 01:17:43,312
He never gave me his address

1091
01:17:43,479 --> 01:17:44,604
One moment

1092
01:17:44,854 --> 01:17:48,479
Go over there, I have a surprise for you

1093
01:17:53,604 --> 01:17:54,854
Close the door

1094
01:18:19,479 --> 01:18:21,854
The judge wanted us to talk

1095
01:18:25,604 --> 01:18:26,687
Where are you going?

1096
01:18:27,854 --> 01:18:29,645
I'm putting out my cigarette

1097
01:18:31,937 --> 01:18:32,937
Why did you do itt?

1098
01:18:34,062 --> 01:18:35,145
I did not kill him!

1099
01:18:36,229 --> 01:18:39,062
But you admitted it yourself

1100
01:18:39,229 --> 01:18:43,437
To kill would have been
reasonable, but it was impossible

1101
01:18:43,604 --> 01:18:47,437
I was avenged by this false confession

1102
01:18:48,895 --> 01:18:51,187
Why do I torture you?

1103
01:18:53,479 --> 01:18:55,604
Because I slept with him?

1104
01:18:58,020 --> 01:18:58,770
Exactly!

1105
01:18:58,937 --> 01:19:00,770
Don't be stupid

1106
01:19:00,937 --> 01:19:02,812
You were not the only one

1107
01:19:03,145 --> 01:19:04,479
What?

1108
01:19:05,020 --> 01:19:06,104
In The Autumn Sonata,

1109
01:19:08,062 --> 01:19:10,895
a pianist has an untalented daughter

1110
01:19:11,062 --> 01:19:12,979
Rather like us...

1111
01:19:13,645 --> 01:19:16,145
The mother comes to see her daughter...

1112
01:19:16,354 --> 01:19:18,562
who also plays the piano

1113
01:19:18,770 --> 01:19:21,979
She asks her to play for her

1114
01:19:22,187 --> 01:19:24,270
The girl is embarrrased,

1115
01:19:24,437 --> 01:19:26,812
but ends up accepting

1116
01:19:26,979 --> 01:19:29,729
and nervously plays some Chopin

1117
01:19:30,312 --> 01:19:32,479
Her mother congratulates
her for her performance,

1118
01:19:32,645 --> 01:19:37,812
but cannot resist criticising

1119
01:19:38,020 --> 01:19:41,437
Nothing could be more
humiliating for the girl

1120
01:19:41,604 --> 01:19:44,604
For her mother says
to her: you are lousy!

1121
01:19:44,770 --> 01:19:48,187
How dare you play this sublime score?

1122
01:19:48,354 --> 01:19:51,354
You think I would put up with this?

1123
01:19:51,562 --> 01:19:55,729
You are too crude to copy my stlye

1124
01:19:56,020 --> 01:19:58,354
Even if you wanted to

1125
01:19:58,520 --> 01:20:02,270
you could not even be my understudy

1126
01:20:03,104 --> 01:20:06,479
Your imitation is not
a homage but an insult!

1127
01:20:06,645 --> 01:20:08,520
What are you talking about?

1128
01:20:08,687 --> 01:20:10,604
I always imitated you

1129
01:20:10,770 --> 01:20:13,812
I always wanted to beat you

1130
01:20:13,979 --> 01:20:18,104
Without ever succeeding, except once!

1131
01:20:18,270 --> 01:20:19,687
With Manuel!

1132
01:20:19,937 --> 01:20:23,645
- We were both losers there
- Yes, but he married me, me!

1133
01:20:23,812 --> 01:20:27,354
You wanted to prove to
me that you could have him

1134
01:20:27,521 --> 01:20:30,854
I knew it, but it was
necessary that you knew it!

1135
01:20:34,854 --> 01:20:36,812
Forgive Me, Rebecca

1136
01:20:39,562 --> 01:20:41,771
I acted badly

1137
01:20:42,312 --> 01:20:44,354
What can I do?

1138
01:20:44,562 --> 01:20:46,729
You can listen to me

1139
01:20:51,562 --> 01:20:52,479
Alright

1140
01:20:54,646 --> 01:20:57,104
I've weighed you down from childhood...

1141
01:20:57,271 --> 01:21:00,979
However, I tried to be useful...

1142
01:21:01,146 --> 01:21:02,771
because I adored you

1143
01:21:03,646 --> 01:21:05,146
The day when Alberto died...

1144
01:21:06,229 --> 01:21:07,104
Yes...

1145
01:21:07,271 --> 01:21:09,479
I heard you talking

1146
01:21:10,521 --> 01:21:12,396
You were trapped,

1147
01:21:12,687 --> 01:21:15,146
there was only one solution

1148
01:21:15,729 --> 01:21:19,229
He took downers and uppers

1149
01:21:19,396 --> 01:21:21,562
I swapped the tablets

1150
01:21:23,187 --> 01:21:24,396
Yes, a moment

1151
01:21:25,187 --> 01:21:27,354
He fell asleep at the wheel

1152
01:21:27,562 --> 01:21:30,271
If I had not killed him, he would
have refused you a divorce...

1153
01:21:30,437 --> 01:21:34,062
and you would not have sung,
nor made films, nor loved

1154
01:21:56,687 --> 01:21:59,187
I wanted to set you free...

1155
01:21:59,396 --> 01:22:02,146
You had promised me
to share everything...

1156
01:22:02,312 --> 01:22:05,771
but you did not keep your promise...

1157
01:22:06,104 --> 01:22:09,104
I will never forgive you...

1158
01:22:40,604 --> 01:22:42,021
Here, Miss

1159
01:23:21,312 --> 01:23:22,104
Who is it?

1160
01:23:23,146 --> 01:23:24,146
Rebecca, listen

1161
01:23:24,312 --> 01:23:26,687
That's it, she is throwing up...

1162
01:23:27,354 --> 01:23:28,687
She's eaten nothing

1163
01:23:30,646 --> 01:23:31,979
Alright?

1164
01:23:33,812 --> 01:23:36,354
Shall we take her to the infirmary?

1165
01:23:36,521 --> 01:23:38,229
Let's take her...

1166
01:23:38,396 --> 01:23:40,521
Come, Rebecca...

1167
01:23:43,604 --> 01:23:46,479
It is nothing, you are pregnant...

1168
01:23:47,312 --> 01:23:49,437
Pregnant? Impossible!

1169
01:23:49,604 --> 01:23:52,562
Yes, the tests prove it...

1170
01:23:53,854 --> 01:23:56,937
You'll have to take
better care of yourself,

1171
01:23:57,104 --> 01:23:58,479
to eat more,

1172
01:23:58,937 --> 01:24:00,354
not to smoke,

1173
01:24:00,521 --> 01:24:03,354
to live a healthy life, without drugs...

1174
01:24:03,521 --> 01:24:04,521
and without drink

1175
01:24:04,687 --> 01:24:08,604
For the rest, be happy, all is well

1176
01:24:11,062 --> 01:24:11,937
What now?

1177
01:24:12,104 --> 01:24:14,479
Lead a healthy life and wait...

1178
01:24:15,021 --> 01:24:17,146
Attention...

1179
01:24:17,396 --> 01:24:21,771
Rebecca Giner please
go to the visiting room

1180
01:24:21,937 --> 01:24:23,062
I repeat

1181
01:24:23,229 --> 01:24:27,771
Rebecca Giner is awaited
in the visiting room

1182
01:24:31,562 --> 01:24:33,937
Well, Rebecca!

1183
01:24:34,104 --> 01:24:38,146
It is you being called
on the loudspeaker!

1184
01:24:38,687 --> 01:24:39,896
Go!

1185
01:24:45,646 --> 01:24:46,396
Who are you?

1186
01:24:46,562 --> 01:24:48,104
A legal agent

1187
01:24:48,271 --> 01:24:50,937
I have your release

1188
01:24:52,604 --> 01:24:54,896
Certificate of release

1189
01:24:55,062 --> 01:24:56,937
Then I am free?

1190
01:24:57,146 --> 01:24:57,937
Yes

1191
01:25:00,146 --> 01:25:01,937
I do not have a pen

1192
01:25:02,354 --> 01:25:04,729
Here, sign

1193
01:25:11,187 --> 01:25:12,562
What do I have to do?

1194
01:25:12,729 --> 01:25:17,146
The govenor has signed,
get your things... Good luck

1195
01:25:17,312 --> 01:25:18,312
Thank you

1196
01:27:29,771 --> 01:27:32,646
- Yes?
- It is Judge Dominguez

1197
01:27:32,813 --> 01:27:36,771
I have just rung you at
home, without success...

1198
01:27:37,438 --> 01:27:39,354
The bell frightened me

1199
01:27:39,938 --> 01:27:44,313
In the prison, I was
told that you are pregnant

1200
01:27:46,063 --> 01:27:48,188
On the level, eh?

1201
01:27:48,354 --> 01:27:50,229
It's true, OK?

1202
01:27:50,854 --> 01:27:51,979
I'll come up

1203
01:27:52,146 --> 01:27:54,479
No, not now... Tomorrow

1204
01:27:54,646 --> 01:27:58,188
I'll come up immediately, just a moment

1205
01:28:32,271 --> 01:28:34,688
Sorry, I have to shake you down

1206
01:28:34,854 --> 01:28:36,771
I thought you would

1207
01:28:37,021 --> 01:28:39,896
You're not here to guard me?

1208
01:28:42,604 --> 01:28:46,104
I'm after Letal... He's
at Villa Rosa this evening

1209
01:28:46,688 --> 01:28:47,854
Who told you?

1210
01:28:48,771 --> 01:28:50,646
He telephoned me at the office

1211
01:28:50,854 --> 01:28:52,563
What a stroke of luck!

1212
01:28:52,896 --> 01:28:55,104
I get out, he shows up

1213
01:28:55,271 --> 01:28:57,063
Being pregnant

1214
01:28:57,438 --> 01:29:00,438
Sometimes things happen like this

1215
01:29:01,438 --> 01:29:02,563
Shall we sit?

1216
01:29:02,771 --> 01:29:04,146
With pleasure

1217
01:29:07,979 --> 01:29:08,771
Why?

1218
01:29:08,979 --> 01:29:10,854
It was his armchair

1219
01:29:12,438 --> 01:29:13,646
Here, can I?

1220
01:29:18,188 --> 01:29:21,021
Letal wants to see you this evening

1221
01:29:21,229 --> 01:29:22,271
Why?

1222
01:29:22,854 --> 01:29:25,104
He must want to speak to you

1223
01:29:25,271 --> 01:29:27,438
You too I imagine

1224
01:29:27,604 --> 01:29:29,188
You imagine wrongly

1225
01:29:29,604 --> 01:29:31,479
I have nothing to say to him

1226
01:29:31,646 --> 01:29:33,729
And nothing he has to
say, could interest me

1227
01:29:34,729 --> 01:29:35,646
Will you go?

1228
01:29:38,688 --> 01:29:39,813
Me, I'm going

1229
01:29:39,979 --> 01:29:41,938
It interests me to listen to him

1230
01:29:43,313 --> 01:29:45,604
And you deny he's your grass?

1231
01:29:46,063 --> 01:29:47,688
How aggressive you are!

1232
01:29:49,896 --> 01:29:51,771
Without me, you'd be rotting in prison!

1233
01:29:52,271 --> 01:29:54,188
Perhaps I should thank you?

1234
01:29:54,354 --> 01:29:59,604
I believed that you had released
me because you thought me innocent

1235
01:30:01,188 --> 01:30:02,771
Sometimes I doubt it

1236
01:30:02,938 --> 01:30:05,646
You've never told me you are

1237
01:30:06,313 --> 01:30:07,229
I am innocent

1238
01:30:07,396 --> 01:30:08,688
Why the TV business?

1239
01:30:11,104 --> 01:30:12,813
I was desperate...

1240
01:30:13,688 --> 01:30:15,063
I felt guilty...

1241
01:30:16,021 --> 01:30:20,063
That might convince
a psychiatrist, not me

1242
01:30:20,729 --> 01:30:24,146
One can feel guilty without
being it... Understand?

1243
01:30:24,313 --> 01:30:27,271
Yes, but you I do not understand

1244
01:30:27,438 --> 01:30:29,563
Me neither

1245
01:30:29,813 --> 01:30:31,979
That makes two of us!

1246
01:30:32,729 --> 01:30:35,104
Why help me?

1247
01:30:35,354 --> 01:30:37,813
Why, if you doubt so much?

1248
01:30:37,979 --> 01:30:39,771
Not your innocence

1249
01:30:40,479 --> 01:30:42,188
That should be enough

1250
01:30:42,354 --> 01:30:43,771
Well it isn't

1251
01:30:44,938 --> 01:30:48,813
I would like to ask
you so many questions

1252
01:30:49,563 --> 01:30:52,229
But I do not have the
right, even if I am the Judge

1253
01:30:52,396 --> 01:30:54,063
We agree on that

1254
01:30:54,229 --> 01:30:55,188
Yes

1255
01:30:56,771 --> 01:30:58,563
I must go

1256
01:30:59,646 --> 01:31:00,604
Goodbye

1257
01:31:05,104 --> 01:31:06,104
Judge...

1258
01:31:09,271 --> 01:31:11,146
You have a cigarette?

1259
01:31:11,604 --> 01:31:12,813
It's bad to smoke

1260
01:31:12,979 --> 01:31:15,688
True... you have a light?

1261
01:31:16,938 --> 01:31:19,438
Excuse my...

1262
01:31:20,438 --> 01:31:23,063
welcome, I was nervous

1263
01:31:25,771 --> 01:31:26,771
Goodbye

1264
01:31:32,271 --> 01:31:33,896
Mum, I am free

1265
01:31:34,063 --> 01:31:36,021
Sorry about yesterday's scence

1266
01:31:36,229 --> 01:31:40,104
I would like to see you tomorrow...

1267
01:31:40,313 --> 01:31:44,521
to kiss you and tell you I love you

1268
01:31:44,688 --> 01:31:47,938
I adore you as always...
Your little Rebecca

1269
01:31:51,229 --> 01:31:52,604
My child...

1270
01:32:12,188 --> 01:32:17,146
If your sorrow is heavy,

1271
01:32:17,313 --> 01:32:19,729
think of me

1272
01:32:23,646 --> 01:32:27,979
If you want to cry,

1273
01:32:28,771 --> 01:32:31,354
think of me

1274
01:32:35,063 --> 01:32:37,104
You can easily see...

1275
01:32:37,604 --> 01:32:42,813
that I worship your divine face...

1276
01:32:45,021 --> 01:32:50,563
your child's mouth...

1277
01:32:51,229 --> 01:32:54,646
that taught me to sin

1278
01:33:00,063 --> 01:33:01,146
Letal!

1279
01:33:01,771 --> 01:33:04,063
I'm just coming!

1280
01:33:40,313 --> 01:33:42,188
Thank you for coming

1281
01:33:43,688 --> 01:33:44,604
You!

1282
01:33:45,646 --> 01:33:47,229
The Judge too?

1283
01:33:47,521 --> 01:33:48,313
Yes

1284
01:33:48,979 --> 01:33:51,729
Can you explain all this?

1285
01:33:52,646 --> 01:33:54,354
That's what I'm here for...

1286
01:33:54,604 --> 01:33:57,188
and to ask you to marry me

1287
01:33:57,354 --> 01:34:01,354
Marry whom? Hugo, Letal, the Judge, who?

1288
01:34:02,146 --> 01:34:03,188
All 3

1289
01:34:08,063 --> 01:34:10,271
The police are investigating, but...

1290
01:34:10,438 --> 01:34:15,771
I have created a character
to unravel one of my cases

1291
01:34:15,938 --> 01:34:18,479
That's gone, I started again

1292
01:34:19,354 --> 01:34:22,271
I invented my clean...

1293
01:34:22,438 --> 01:34:23,438
informers...

1294
01:34:23,813 --> 01:34:24,813
It is true?

1295
01:34:25,480 --> 01:34:28,646
Yes... also true that
you're expecting my child

1296
01:34:29,855 --> 01:34:30,771
Ah yes?

1297
01:34:31,480 --> 01:34:33,855
You did not screw Manuel

1298
01:34:34,438 --> 01:34:36,980
I was able to lie to you, I too can lie

1299
01:34:37,771 --> 01:34:39,230
I know

1300
01:34:39,438 --> 01:34:43,730
If the child were not mine, you'd
have gone to see your mother, not me

1301
01:34:46,646 --> 01:34:48,271
- Give me
- Hold

1302
01:34:51,605 --> 01:34:53,355
What was Letal after?

1303
01:34:53,563 --> 01:34:56,938
He worked on the assassination
of a transvestite,

1304
01:34:57,146 --> 01:34:59,355
but I did not find anything

1305
01:34:59,646 --> 01:35:02,271
In short yes, you

1306
01:35:25,271 --> 01:35:28,688
My mother's warehouse: my den

1307
01:35:29,646 --> 01:35:30,896
What a brothel!

1308
01:35:33,521 --> 01:35:37,521
You are the 1st person
I've brought here...

1309
01:35:41,271 --> 01:35:42,563
Oh, Rebecca

1310
01:35:43,146 --> 01:35:45,480
Do we fight or do I put on my beard?

1311
01:35:45,646 --> 01:35:49,063
Put on your beard... The
state my head is in...

1312
01:35:49,230 --> 01:35:50,188
Relax...

1313
01:35:50,355 --> 01:35:52,271
Don't

1314
01:35:53,105 --> 01:35:55,771
I'm taking off my sweater
to put on the beard...

1315
01:35:59,855 --> 01:36:01,730
You put it on at your mother's?

1316
01:36:02,438 --> 01:36:03,605
Of course

1317
01:36:04,521 --> 01:36:05,521
She suspects?

1318
01:36:06,396 --> 01:36:10,313
No, she is insane and
never leaves her room

1319
01:36:12,188 --> 01:36:13,605
What a family!

1320
01:36:14,688 --> 01:36:18,271
How can you lie to everyone?

1321
01:36:19,896 --> 01:36:22,980
Everyone, except you and me

1322
01:36:23,730 --> 01:36:26,355
And those you leave behind...?

1323
01:36:26,521 --> 01:36:28,980
Paula, who fell in
love with your character

1324
01:36:30,521 --> 01:36:32,313
Now, there's just me

1325
01:36:32,605 --> 01:36:36,730
Letal has explained
everything to you today

1326
01:36:36,896 --> 01:36:38,355
How can I believe you?

1327
01:36:38,521 --> 01:36:40,605
How do I know you're not a murderer?

1328
01:36:40,771 --> 01:36:43,605
And you, that you are
not a queer or a junkie?

1329
01:36:44,355 --> 01:36:47,771
Let's not complicate life with that

1330
01:36:48,105 --> 01:36:49,855
We are imperfect

1331
01:36:50,021 --> 01:36:54,605
With this confession,
you could destroy me

1332
01:36:54,771 --> 01:36:56,146
I do not want to

1333
01:36:56,313 --> 01:36:57,396
Marry me, then!

1334
01:36:57,563 --> 01:36:59,396
You're crazy!

1335
01:36:59,563 --> 01:37:04,146
It must be settled now,
we have started a family

1336
01:37:05,313 --> 01:37:07,688
Letal, don't confuse me more

1337
01:37:07,896 --> 01:37:09,396
I am called Eduardo

1338
01:37:09,896 --> 01:37:13,146
I have to get married and I
have only just learned your name

1339
01:37:13,313 --> 01:37:14,480
Oh yes

1340
01:37:27,730 --> 01:37:30,813
This song always makes me cry

1341
01:37:31,188 --> 01:37:32,480
It is beautiful

1342
01:37:38,896 --> 01:37:43,438
Becky del Paramo has just
been rushed to hospital,

1343
01:37:43,646 --> 01:37:46,646
following an infarction...

1344
01:37:46,855 --> 01:37:50,146
at the theatre where she
was playing successfully...

1345
01:37:50,355 --> 01:37:53,938
According to Dr. Tavora,
the artist suffers...

1346
01:37:54,105 --> 01:37:57,938
with angina that she hid...

1347
01:38:24,021 --> 01:38:25,313
Rebecca, at last...

1348
01:38:25,813 --> 01:38:26,605
What?

1349
01:38:26,771 --> 01:38:29,230
She's unwell, she asked for you

1350
01:38:29,896 --> 01:38:33,146
Do not speak to her too much

1351
01:38:33,438 --> 01:38:34,855
I am the Judge

1352
01:38:37,605 --> 01:38:39,230
Sit down

1353
01:38:44,688 --> 01:38:46,271
Rebecca, come her

1354
01:38:53,063 --> 01:38:54,313
My daughter

1355
01:38:54,480 --> 01:38:56,605
At last you are free!

1356
01:38:56,938 --> 01:38:58,396
For lack of evidence

1357
01:38:58,563 --> 01:39:00,563
Protect yourself!

1358
01:39:01,021 --> 01:39:03,896
But to me, you owe the truth

1359
01:39:07,605 --> 01:39:09,730
Tell me the truth

1360
01:39:09,980 --> 01:39:12,688
I do not want to die in ignorance

1361
01:39:17,021 --> 01:39:18,480
I killed him

1362
01:39:19,521 --> 01:39:21,980
You are not the only culprit

1363
01:39:22,146 --> 01:39:23,980
Do not say that

1364
01:39:24,355 --> 01:39:26,980
Why keep your illness hidden?

1365
01:39:27,146 --> 01:39:29,813
That would have been blackmail

1366
01:39:29,980 --> 01:39:33,063
It is as if I had killed you too

1367
01:39:33,688 --> 01:39:37,021
Don't feel more guilty, one is enough

1368
01:39:40,438 --> 01:39:41,605
Listen...

1369
01:39:41,771 --> 01:39:44,021
Tell the Judge to come in

1370
01:39:44,521 --> 01:39:45,355
Why?

1371
01:39:45,521 --> 01:39:48,646
I must speak to him

1372
01:39:57,146 --> 01:39:58,021
She wants...

1373
01:39:58,188 --> 01:39:59,813
Forgive me, I was called

1374
01:39:59,980 --> 01:40:01,855
Yes, Father

1375
01:40:02,313 --> 01:40:04,188
Enter, please

1376
01:40:06,396 --> 01:40:08,688
Come closer, Judge

1377
01:40:10,396 --> 01:40:12,605
There is little time

1378
01:40:13,771 --> 01:40:15,646
I wanted to tell you

1379
01:40:15,813 --> 01:40:17,938
You were right

1380
01:40:19,146 --> 01:40:20,521
I killed Manuel

1381
01:40:23,271 --> 01:40:25,938
Rebecca confessed to protect me

1382
01:40:27,230 --> 01:40:28,688
But it was me

1383
01:40:28,855 --> 01:40:30,396
I knew it

1384
01:40:30,855 --> 01:40:32,396
And how?

1385
01:40:33,063 --> 01:40:35,146
With his revolver

1386
01:40:36,313 --> 01:40:39,230
But no more details

1387
01:40:39,938 --> 01:40:41,146
There is no time

1388
01:40:41,313 --> 01:40:43,355
I need proof

1389
01:40:43,605 --> 01:40:47,605
What more proof do you need?...

1390
01:40:49,688 --> 01:40:53,063
I am square with human justice,

1391
01:40:54,021 --> 01:40:56,605
there remains that of God

1392
01:40:58,480 --> 01:41:01,271
Rebecca, call the priest

1393
01:41:01,438 --> 01:41:02,646
Yes, mum

1394
01:41:02,813 --> 01:41:05,480
Do not cry any more, daughter

1395
01:41:11,063 --> 01:41:13,105
She wants to confess

1396
01:41:13,563 --> 01:41:15,521
It is madness!

1397
01:41:15,688 --> 01:41:19,271
It is natural to want to confess

1398
01:41:31,730 --> 01:41:36,772
What can I say? My last
confession was a long time ago

1399
01:41:37,313 --> 01:41:41,563
The introduction is
a little long, in fact

1400
01:41:41,730 --> 01:41:44,188
I believe that this will be enough

1401
01:41:44,688 --> 01:41:47,730
No confession since when?

1402
01:41:48,938 --> 01:41:50,272
I was a child

1403
01:41:50,438 --> 01:41:55,022
Let's do it like when you were child

1404
01:41:57,313 --> 01:41:58,522
Holy Mary...

1405
01:41:58,688 --> 01:42:00,813
Conceived without sin

1406
01:42:01,897 --> 01:42:05,022
I confess to all that I have lied

1407
01:42:05,480 --> 01:42:09,897
I admited I killed my
son-in-law and that is false

1408
01:42:10,313 --> 01:42:11,272
It was not me

1409
01:42:11,438 --> 01:42:12,730
Why lie?

1410
01:42:14,272 --> 01:42:16,022
To save my daughter

1411
01:42:16,605 --> 01:42:20,272
If your daughter committed
so serious a crime...

1412
01:42:20,438 --> 01:42:24,522
it is up to God to save her, not you

1413
01:42:25,938 --> 01:42:29,063
I am her mother, God will understand

1414
01:42:29,730 --> 01:42:31,897
My life was no use to her

1415
01:42:32,313 --> 01:42:35,272
My death will do her some good

1416
01:42:36,480 --> 01:42:39,105
You repent your lie?

1417
01:42:39,897 --> 01:42:40,980
No

1418
01:42:41,563 --> 01:42:44,438
I am glad to have done it

1419
01:42:44,605 --> 01:42:46,563
Your intention is good...

1420
01:42:46,730 --> 01:42:51,105
but for God to exonerate
you, you must repent

1421
01:42:55,272 --> 01:43:00,480
I repent all the misfortune
that I have caused

1422
01:43:20,480 --> 01:43:22,980
Tell me all

1423
01:43:23,147 --> 01:43:25,188
Don't be morbid

1424
01:43:25,355 --> 01:43:27,897
No, my daughter...

1425
01:43:28,563 --> 01:43:32,105
but the Judge is not very convinced,

1426
01:43:33,230 --> 01:43:36,188
I fear he will question me

1427
01:43:37,355 --> 01:43:38,230
Ok

1428
01:43:39,688 --> 01:43:41,313
Let us see

1429
01:43:42,313 --> 01:43:45,855
When I arrived, Manuel was sleeping

1430
01:43:46,438 --> 01:43:50,272
How could he sleep after my visit?

1431
01:43:50,438 --> 01:43:52,522
Nevertheless, he slept

1432
01:43:54,147 --> 01:43:58,563
My pills were beside his revolver

1433
01:43:58,897 --> 01:44:01,438
The noise of the drawer awoke him

1434
01:44:01,980 --> 01:44:04,730
I asked him how he
preferred I commit suicide...

1435
01:44:04,897 --> 01:44:07,938
A bullet or an overdose?

1436
01:44:08,105 --> 01:44:09,272
And then?

1437
01:44:09,438 --> 01:44:12,730
He said he couldn't give a fuck

1438
01:44:12,897 --> 01:44:14,147
Ah, men!

1439
01:44:14,355 --> 01:44:16,272
We started to argue

1440
01:44:17,480 --> 01:44:21,938
Tell me the worst, he will ask

1441
01:44:24,355 --> 01:44:27,772
The distance when you fired...

1442
01:44:28,022 --> 01:44:32,772
on which side of the bed he fell...

1443
01:44:32,980 --> 01:44:34,855
I do not want to be short on detail

1444
01:44:35,063 --> 01:44:37,897
Do not worry, I will tell you all

1445
01:44:38,063 --> 01:44:39,605
Do not tire yourself

1446
01:44:40,147 --> 01:44:41,313
Listen...

1447
01:44:41,688 --> 01:44:44,522
I decided to kill myself,

1448
01:44:44,772 --> 01:44:47,272
when Manuel dared me...

1449
01:44:47,522 --> 01:44:49,772
Then, I lost my temper and I fired

1450
01:44:50,022 --> 01:44:52,522
not at me but at him

1451
01:44:53,105 --> 01:44:54,730
He fell...

1452
01:44:54,897 --> 01:44:58,230
but I could not look at,
his surprised expression...

1453
01:44:58,813 --> 01:45:02,563
and I turned him over towards the right

1454
01:45:03,938 --> 01:45:08,397
But, in spite of his
bad treatment of us...

1455
01:45:08,563 --> 01:45:10,605
I was sad...

1456
01:45:10,772 --> 01:45:13,522
because nobody deserves to die like that

1457
01:45:16,730 --> 01:45:21,480
You must learn how to manage
your problems with men better

1458
01:45:22,063 --> 01:45:24,188
Yes, mum

1459
01:45:24,772 --> 01:45:26,688
Teach me

1460
01:45:53,772 --> 01:45:55,563
Never mind, I'll go

1461
01:46:04,563 --> 01:46:06,355
- Well?
- The same

1462
01:46:10,188 --> 01:46:11,438
Rebecca

1463
01:46:12,230 --> 01:46:14,355
I must speak to you

1464
01:46:14,522 --> 01:46:17,230
First, I must see her

1465
01:46:18,480 --> 01:46:19,397
She's waiting for you

1466
01:46:19,563 --> 01:46:22,272
Put the bag in her room

1467
01:46:23,688 --> 01:46:25,313
I am leaving the case

1468
01:46:25,480 --> 01:46:28,147
I will ask for another

1469
01:46:28,313 --> 01:46:30,355
But it is solved!

1470
01:46:30,522 --> 01:46:32,688
I am too involved...

1471
01:46:32,855 --> 01:46:35,480
This nightmare will never end

1472
01:46:35,647 --> 01:46:39,438
I do not have any evidence against
her... And now is not the time

1473
01:46:39,605 --> 01:46:41,855
I will give you, evidence, myself

1474
01:47:03,897 --> 01:47:06,730
Mum, I brought my things

1475
01:47:06,897 --> 01:47:08,272
That's good

1476
01:47:09,647 --> 01:47:13,688
We're living together again

1477
01:47:17,313 --> 01:47:18,397
And the revolver?

1478
01:47:18,605 --> 01:47:20,230
I have it there

1479
01:47:20,397 --> 01:47:21,188
Give it to me

1480
01:47:21,355 --> 01:47:24,855
Mum, are you sure you want to do this?

1481
01:47:25,313 --> 01:47:26,022
Yes

1482
01:47:47,230 --> 01:47:48,813
Not like this

1483
01:47:49,563 --> 01:47:51,522
I did it like this

1484
01:48:15,480 --> 01:48:16,855
Thank you

1485
01:48:20,272 --> 01:48:22,480
Open the windows

1486
01:48:23,855 --> 01:48:25,897
I want to see the street

1487
01:48:48,939 --> 01:48:51,439
As a child, when we lived together...

1488
01:48:52,314 --> 01:48:56,064
I could not get to sleep
without hearing your heels...

1489
01:48:56,689 --> 01:48:58,397
far away...

1490
01:48:59,064 --> 01:49:03,647
fading away in the corridor,
after you had passed to see me

1491
01:49:19,314 --> 01:49:22,022
It didn't matter how late...

1492
01:49:23,522 --> 01:49:26,189
I stayed awake...

1493
01:49:26,647 --> 01:49:29,397
for the sound of your heels...
