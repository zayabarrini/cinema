1
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,418
"This isn't a tale of heroic feats.

2
00:00:31,503 --> 00:00:36,006
It's about two lives running parallel for a while,

3
00:00:36,132 --> 00:00:40,679
with common aspirations and similar dreams."
Ernesto Guevara de la Serna, 1952

4
00:00:51,941 --> 00:00:55,152
Goodbye boys, life-long companions

5
00:00:55,278 --> 00:00:58,321
Dear old-time gang

6
00:01:11,543 --> 00:01:12,877
The plan:

7
00:01:13,003 --> 00:01:16,423
8000 kilometres in four months.

8
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:18,799
The method:

9
00:01:19,094 --> 00:01:20,509
improvisation.

10
00:01:24,223 --> 00:01:26,100
We've got to be ready for certain things in life...

11
00:01:27,226 --> 00:01:28,227
The goal:

12
00:01:28,645 --> 00:01:32,312
to explore a continent
we had only known in books.

13
00:01:32,438 --> 00:01:36,945
the motorcycle diaries

14
00:01:37,654 --> 00:01:38,653
Good night, Granado.

15
00:01:39,821 --> 00:01:41,156
The equipment:

16
00:01:41,657 --> 00:01:43,241
"The Mighty One,"

17
00:01:43,995 --> 00:01:47,037
an aged, leaky 1 939 Norton 500.

18
00:01:55,171 --> 00:01:56,213
The pilot:

19
00:01:56,298 --> 00:01:57,716
Alberto Granado,

20
00:01:57,842 --> 00:02:00,549
chubby, 29, friend and biochemist,

21
00:02:00,633 --> 00:02:02,594
self-proclaimed "wandering scientist".

22
00:02:03,013 --> 00:02:04,723
Alberto's dream:

23
00:02:04,849 --> 00:02:06,848
to finish the journey on his 30th birthday.

24
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:15,274
Co-pilot: me, Ernesto Guevara de la Serna.
"El Fuser", 23.

25
00:02:15,358 --> 00:02:17,276
Is Ernesto really going?

26
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,359
No, Ernesto is staying.

27
00:02:18,444 --> 00:02:21,529
Ernesto, will you take me with you?
Let's go together!

28
00:02:21,614 --> 00:02:23,698
Sorry Dad but the more you tell me...

29
00:02:23,782 --> 00:02:26,827
You're only one semester away
from becoming a doctor.

30
00:02:26,912 --> 00:02:28,286
That can wait.

31
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:34,460
Medical student, specialising in leprosy,

32
00:02:34,544 --> 00:02:36,126
Here comes furious Serna!

33
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,547
...amateur rugby player,

34
00:02:38,632 --> 00:02:39,631
Kick it!

35
00:02:40,218 --> 00:02:42,217
Nice shot, Fuser!

36
00:02:42,301 --> 00:02:44,636
...and occasional asthmatic.

37
00:02:56,649 --> 00:02:57,816
Date of departure, January 4th.

38
00:02:57,901 --> 00:02:58,900
The route:

39
00:02:58,984 --> 00:03:02,404
Buenos Aires to Patagonia, and then into Chile...

40
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:07,869
then north, 6000 metres up
the rugged spine of the Andes to Machu Picchu.

41
00:03:08,746 --> 00:03:12,997
Then, the San Pablo Leper Colony
in the Peruvian Amazon.

42
00:03:14,376 --> 00:03:19,837
The final destination:
the Guajira Peninsula in Venezuela.

43
00:03:20,174 --> 00:03:22,259
We land on the Guajira Peninsula.

44
00:03:22,343 --> 00:03:24,342
The tip of this grand continent.

45
00:03:24,843 --> 00:03:28,264
Bellies full of wine and two
tropical beauties, hopefully sisters...

46
00:03:28,348 --> 00:03:29,391
That beer's good, huh?

47
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:33,102
ByJanuary 4th you'll have
finished your exams, right?

48
00:03:34,522 --> 00:03:40,067
If you'd like, I'll agree to make a little detour,
go by Miramar, see your girlfriend.

49
00:03:40,193 --> 00:03:41,611
My girlfriend...

50
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,695
A couple of days.

51
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,535
Check out that guy over there.

52
00:03:48,619 --> 00:03:49,702
Yeah?

53
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:51,787
Do you want to end up like that?

54
00:03:52,955 --> 00:03:55,667
You don't wanna end up like that, Fuser.

55
00:03:56,543 --> 00:03:59,545
All you want is to get laid
in every country in South America.

56
00:04:00,004 --> 00:04:03,968
In every town too, if we're lucky.
Adds a little spice.

57
00:04:04,802 --> 00:04:06,051
What we had in common:

58
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:09,639
our restlessness, our impassioned spirits,

59
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:13,434
and a love for the open road.

60
00:04:16,062 --> 00:04:19,107
Come on Ernestito, we don't have all day.

61
00:04:19,191 --> 00:04:21,274
-Isn't this too much stuff?
-Just enough.

62
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,403
Norton 500. A real motorcycle.

63
00:04:24,571 --> 00:04:27,323
Don't worry about your son,
he'll be well taken care of.

64
00:04:27,407 --> 00:04:28,406
Son...

65
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:35,079
Tough times are ahead.

66
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:39,420
To tell the truth, I've always dreamt
of doing something like this.

67
00:04:39,504 --> 00:04:41,587
I confess that if I were a few years younger

68
00:04:42,129 --> 00:04:44,549
I'd climb on that motorcycle with you.

69
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:46,218
Imagine I'm doing it for both of us.

70
00:04:46,303 --> 00:04:48,260
Ten years, planning this trip, Uncle.

71
00:04:48,345 --> 00:04:49,637
You were a kid...

72
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:53,850
Meanwhile, I trust you.

73
00:04:56,186 --> 00:04:57,728
So, when's the revolution coming?

74
00:04:57,896 --> 00:04:59,105
Here?

75
00:04:59,357 --> 00:05:02,858
-In about a century.
-We should learn from the Russians.

76
00:05:02,942 --> 00:05:05,737
-Leaving already?
-Yes. I'm off.

77
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:13,661
The only thing you need to worry about
is taking your medicine...

78
00:05:13,829 --> 00:05:15,455
and writing to me.

79
00:05:15,998 --> 00:05:18,665
The most beautiful letters you'll ever read, Mum.

80
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:20,543
-Goodbye, my darling.
-You'll see.

81
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:29,928
Bye, sis! Take care!

82
00:05:32,014 --> 00:05:32,888
Bye!

83
00:05:32,972 --> 00:05:34,599
-No.
-Juan Martín!

84
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,309
-Bye!
-Write to me.

85
00:05:36,477 --> 00:05:37,559
Okay?

86
00:05:41,857 --> 00:05:43,067
Send me postcards.

87
00:05:43,151 --> 00:05:46,194
Enough sentimentality,
you're gonna make me cry.

88
00:05:47,112 --> 00:05:48,113
Take care.

89
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:53,243
So, just like Don Quixote had Rocinante,
San Martín had his mule,

90
00:05:53,327 --> 00:05:55,787
-we have "The Mighty One."
-Yeah, which pees oil.

91
00:05:55,871 --> 00:05:59,874
Yeah, she pees oil. What I'm trying
to say is that in this very instant,

92
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:02,169
young Fuser and your servant here,

93
00:06:02,253 --> 00:06:05,338
embark on a journey to
the farthest reaches of the human spirit,

94
00:06:05,673 --> 00:06:09,676
where we will encounter new lands,
hear new anthems, eat new fruits...

95
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:13,095
Granado, I'm holding you responsible.
Anything that happens to Ernesto,

96
00:06:13,179 --> 00:06:16,100
I'm going to burn you down.
Put on the scarf, honey.

97
00:06:16,184 --> 00:06:20,436
Don't worry, ma'am. He'll come back
and be the doctor we all want him to be.

98
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,857
It's time to go!

99
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,693
That bike is a good excuse for walking.

100
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,700
So long!

101
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:43,001
Watch out!

102
00:06:43,085 --> 00:06:44,086
He's crazy!

103
00:06:44,588 --> 00:06:45,589
Animal!

104
00:06:50,717 --> 00:06:52,679
Careful with that bike!

105
00:07:07,402 --> 00:07:08,568
Dear Mum,

106
00:07:08,986 --> 00:07:10,529
Buenos Aires is behind us.

107
00:07:11,238 --> 00:07:17,453
Gone is "this wretched life," the uninspiring
lectures, the papers and medical exams.

108
00:07:17,621 --> 00:07:20,624
All of Latin America is ahead of us.

109
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:24,041
From now on, we only trust in "The Mighty One."

110
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:52,321
I wish you could see us! We look like outlaws,
commanding attention everywhere we go...

111
00:08:05,834 --> 00:08:09,839
Open it up, Mial! Put her into orbit!

112
00:08:11,132 --> 00:08:14,384
-Don't quit on me, Mighty One!
-Come on!

113
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,722
-What happened, Mial?
-Fucking shit!

114
00:08:24,689 --> 00:08:30,359
I am glad we've left "civilization" behind
and are now a bit closer to the land.

115
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:34,195
What's going on?

116
00:08:34,364 --> 00:08:35,572
We're losing our bags!

117
00:08:35,656 --> 00:08:37,408
Problems! Problems!

118
00:08:39,703 --> 00:08:41,202
Damn! Fucking shit!

119
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:45,458
-Fuser, are you all right?
-Yeah, you?

120
00:08:47,668 --> 00:08:49,587
What's up, little one?

121
00:08:54,508 --> 00:08:56,510
Are you okay?

122
00:08:57,513 --> 00:09:00,472
-What the fuck is that?
-What the fuck does it look like?

123
00:09:00,599 --> 00:09:04,100
-A fucking dog!
-You're a fucking shitty driver!

124
00:09:04,186 --> 00:09:06,438
Fuck you! What's that fucking dog
doing on my bike?

125
00:09:06,522 --> 00:09:08,771
It's for Chichina. His name is "Come-back".

126
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,486
Go on, pick up the bike.

127
00:09:34,634 --> 00:09:36,883
Where the fuck are we, in Switzerland?

128
00:09:41,599 --> 00:09:43,349
-Good day.
-Good day.

129
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:47,020
-Chichina?
-She's at the beach with the family.

130
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:50,522
The bike's not doing so well.

131
00:09:53,611 --> 00:09:56,571
So, Esteban, tell us about your trip.

132
00:09:56,739 --> 00:09:58,196
It was fantastic, Don Horacio.

133
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,659
I had the opportunity
to take a seminar in Cambridge

134
00:10:02,245 --> 00:10:05,411
and spend a couple of weeks in London,
a fascinating city.

135
00:10:05,496 --> 00:10:07,916
-Oh, what a privilege.
-Yes. A privilege.

136
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,377
Esteban is about to get his doctorate...

137
00:10:13,214 --> 00:10:14,254
In medicine?

138
00:10:14,424 --> 00:10:15,465
No. In law.

139
00:10:16,551 --> 00:10:17,926
Oh, law...

140
00:11:18,113 --> 00:11:20,697
One, two, three, four. Tango, Fuser!

141
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:22,867
It's your turn now...

142
00:11:23,284 --> 00:11:26,412
I've never seen a pig who liked to dance. Ever.

143
00:11:27,872 --> 00:11:30,832
-Yeah.
-Fuck off.

144
00:11:33,127 --> 00:11:36,378
With this foot, one... back, back...

145
00:11:36,546 --> 00:11:38,089
What are you laughing at?

146
00:11:39,425 --> 00:11:41,343
-What are you laughing at?
-You.

147
00:11:48,518 --> 00:11:49,768
Tonight?

148
00:11:50,018 --> 00:11:53,355
Dad asked Aunt Rosana
not to let me out of her sight.

149
00:11:53,814 --> 00:11:57,232
And Mum promised the Virgin
that she'd walk to her sanctuary...

150
00:11:57,317 --> 00:11:59,068
if we break up.

151
00:11:59,863 --> 00:12:03,615
Don't your parents realise
that the deeper you bury the diamonds,

152
00:12:03,699 --> 00:12:06,034
the more determined the pirate is, to take them?

153
00:12:07,245 --> 00:12:08,411
Believe me,

154
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:11,371
this diamond wouldn't mind being taken.

155
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,128
Dance.

156
00:12:24,386 --> 00:12:25,719
Look at them.

157
00:12:27,431 --> 00:12:29,390
Check out La Negra!

158
00:12:37,692 --> 00:12:39,234
Let's check out the bathroom.

159
00:12:43,489 --> 00:12:44,824
Good night.

160
00:12:44,908 --> 00:12:47,409
-Good night, girls.
-Good night.

161
00:12:50,748 --> 00:12:53,331
-Good night.
-Good night.

162
00:12:53,915 --> 00:12:56,585
So, Aunt Rosana,

163
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:58,921
which room do I get?

164
00:13:09,765 --> 00:13:11,726
Get out, Come-back. Scat!

165
00:13:20,776 --> 00:13:22,987
What happened there...?

166
00:13:24,115 --> 00:13:26,533
-Come here.
-Don't tickle me!

167
00:13:57,939 --> 00:14:00,691
How long did you say we'd be here?

168
00:14:01,027 --> 00:14:02,026
You know how long.

169
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:03,110
Two days.

170
00:14:03,569 --> 00:14:05,446
And how long has it been?

171
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:07,656
Are you gonna use wire
in the operating room, too?

172
00:14:07,782 --> 00:14:09,450
Six days, Fuser!

173
00:14:14,122 --> 00:14:16,165
They're going to kill us!

174
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,645
If you stayed we could do many things,
Ernesto, but only if you stayed.

175
00:14:42,275 --> 00:14:45,069
-That didn't sound so good.
-What do you want to hear?

176
00:14:46,572 --> 00:14:48,071
That I'll wait for you?

177
00:14:48,282 --> 00:14:50,533
I told you I'm coming back.

178
00:14:51,868 --> 00:14:53,409
I have the dog to prove it.

179
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,455
Don't you like him?

180
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:59,333
What do you want, Ernesto?

181
00:15:00,753 --> 00:15:01,835
What do you want to hear?

182
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,382
That I'll wait forever, that I'll
wait months on end for you to return?

183
00:15:11,223 --> 00:15:13,180
-What's up with you?
-What do you want?

184
00:15:15,183 --> 00:15:16,183
What?

185
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:23,023
I'd like for you to stay like this, silent.

186
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,989
I want to look at you.
I won't see you for a long time.

187
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:42,333
I will wait for you, but don't take forever.

188
00:15:48,009 --> 00:15:49,718
Define "forever."

189
00:15:49,969 --> 00:15:52,721
Thin ice, mister!

190
00:15:59,145 --> 00:16:00,813
I won't touch you again.

191
00:16:06,569 --> 00:16:10,611
Oh, no, I hurt you. Did I hurt you?

192
00:16:12,032 --> 00:16:15,161
It's a trick. A really bad one.

193
00:16:16,703 --> 00:16:19,874
Okay, lovebirds, it's time to go.

194
00:16:19,957 --> 00:16:20,999
Fuser...

195
00:16:23,835 --> 00:16:25,295
Take care, Miss Ferreyra.

196
00:16:27,298 --> 00:16:28,632
Thanks for everything.

197
00:16:48,861 --> 00:16:51,904
On the boat I heard
the moist slap of bare feet

198
00:16:51,988 --> 00:16:54,656
and foresaw faces
dark with hunger.

199
00:16:55,576 --> 00:16:58,495
My heart was a pendulum
between her and the street.

200
00:16:59,662 --> 00:17:03,834
I don't know what strength broke me
free from her eyes, loose from her arms.

201
00:17:04,669 --> 00:17:08,712
She remained clouded by tears,
her anguish hidden by the rain.

202
00:17:09,132 --> 00:17:10,883
-Is that Lorca?
-No.

203
00:17:11,842 --> 00:17:13,300
-Neruda?
-No.

204
00:17:13,843 --> 00:17:14,928
Who?

205
00:17:15,806 --> 00:17:17,013
I don't remember.

206
00:17:45,376 --> 00:17:46,710
Goodbye!

207
00:17:51,216 --> 00:17:52,215
Wait, wait... there.

208
00:17:52,299 --> 00:17:54,135
I'm getting snot all over this...

209
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:59,055
So with Chichina - nothing?

210
00:18:01,642 --> 00:18:05,104
Even after you gave her
a purebred German shepherd, nothing?

211
00:18:06,899 --> 00:18:09,731
At least tell me you saw one tit. One little tit.

212
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:18,074
Ah, so you saw her titties then. All right, my man!

213
00:18:18,284 --> 00:18:21,371
Scalpel.

214
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:25,039
American dollars.

215
00:18:25,749 --> 00:18:26,917
Fifteen.

216
00:18:27,418 --> 00:18:28,420
Chichina?

217
00:18:28,503 --> 00:18:29,503
Yup.

218
00:18:29,588 --> 00:18:31,589
That girl's perfect for you. I've always said so:

219
00:18:31,673 --> 00:18:34,008
that is Ernesto's girlfriend.
No we'll be able to eat like kings.

220
00:18:34,092 --> 00:18:35,593
-No.
-A succulent protein-filled meal.

221
00:18:35,719 --> 00:18:38,429
She gave me this money in case
we make it to the United States.

222
00:18:38,805 --> 00:18:40,806
She asked me to buy her a bathing suit.

223
00:18:42,934 --> 00:18:44,058
I said I would.

224
00:18:45,395 --> 00:18:46,352
What?

225
00:18:46,437 --> 00:18:49,566
Pretend this money doesn't exist. It's off-limits.

226
00:18:49,816 --> 00:18:52,776
He's testing me... I'm gonna kill him.

227
00:18:52,861 --> 00:18:54,279
Are you talking to the bike again?

228
00:18:54,363 --> 00:18:58,781
What the hell are you thinking?
This girl's got you by the balls!

229
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,366
-No...
-Fuser!

230
00:19:00,451 --> 00:19:02,161
Don't get all worked up, fatty.

231
00:19:03,414 --> 00:19:04,538
-Hello.
-Good afternoon.

232
00:19:23,642 --> 00:19:25,018
How's the bike feel?

233
00:19:25,268 --> 00:19:26,726
It's amazing, you can fix anything with wire.

234
00:19:26,852 --> 00:19:28,811
It's riding better than ever.

235
00:19:34,945 --> 00:19:37,696
Damn it! Fucking shit!

236
00:19:39,699 --> 00:19:40,990
You all right, Fuser?

237
00:19:43,287 --> 00:19:45,163
Damn curve.

238
00:19:52,089 --> 00:19:55,004
Look at the exhaust pipe!
Damn it to hell and back!

239
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:58,550
Get more pegs! I've run out!

240
00:19:58,635 --> 00:19:59,678
Don't bust my balls!

241
00:19:59,762 --> 00:20:02,095
-Just grab it!
-You had to choose this spot, asshole!

242
00:20:02,179 --> 00:20:05,100
-You're the one that chose it!
-Hold on to that side!

243
00:20:05,183 --> 00:20:07,851
-You hold on to your side first!
-Come on!

244
00:20:07,936 --> 00:20:10,562
-I just can't!
-Come on!

245
00:20:10,647 --> 00:20:13,650
The ground is wet!
What the fuck do you want me to do?

246
00:20:14,567 --> 00:20:16,695
Fucking shit!

247
00:20:18,029 --> 00:20:20,199
No, the river took it!

248
00:20:20,449 --> 00:20:21,865
Get it, get it!

249
00:20:23,367 --> 00:20:25,035
It's gone!

250
00:20:27,623 --> 00:20:29,206
Just take it...

251
00:20:36,881 --> 00:20:39,174
Why don't we go up to that ranch?

252
00:20:39,259 --> 00:20:40,592
With those snobs?

253
00:20:41,221 --> 00:20:43,178
We'll find help down here,
among the people, don't you think?

254
00:20:43,263 --> 00:20:44,262
Yeah.

255
00:20:48,312 --> 00:20:50,978
-Should we do the broken headlight thing?
-Red October.

256
00:20:51,312 --> 00:20:53,355
-What's Red October?
-You have your medical ID, right?

257
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,815
Oh, yeah, yeah.

258
00:20:58,779 --> 00:21:00,154
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

259
00:21:01,282 --> 00:21:02,450
What do you want?

260
00:21:02,534 --> 00:21:06,952
It may not look like it,
but, well, we're both doctors...

261
00:21:07,412 --> 00:21:10,165
from Buenos Aires and Córdoba, respectively.

262
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:12,959
We are travelling the length
and breadth of the country...

263
00:21:13,252 --> 00:21:14,836
Well, he's got one, too.

264
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:19,924
We're travelling all over doing some
research with the hope of curing

265
00:21:20,092 --> 00:21:23,637
some of the most terrifying diseases
of the 20th century.

266
00:21:23,722 --> 00:21:25,596
Plagues that not only consume our energies

267
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:29,726
but also keep Argentina under total dependence.

268
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:34,397
As a matter of fact, if you read
the medical literature, you'll note, as we have...

269
00:21:34,482 --> 00:21:37,693
What the fuck do you bums want?

270
00:21:39,986 --> 00:21:45,492
Look, sir. The wind took our tent.
We're starving and need a place to sleep.

271
00:21:46,369 --> 00:21:52,749
There's a shed out there with a good floor.
You can sleep with the migrants.

272
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:56,168
But we're doctors...

273
00:21:57,963 --> 00:21:59,506
I like your face very much.

274
00:21:59,924 --> 00:22:01,881
Yours, fatty, I don't like.

275
00:22:05,137 --> 00:22:07,721
-It's cool.
-It's okay.

276
00:22:22,112 --> 00:22:23,238
Dear Mum.

277
00:22:23,322 --> 00:22:29,451
We're still going strong, though
"The Mighty One" isn't so mighty any more.

278
00:22:42,007 --> 00:22:48,389
Money and food are scarce but we've
managed to scrounge some free food,

279
00:22:50,974 --> 00:22:52,641
thanks to our secret weapon,

280
00:22:52,767 --> 00:22:55,146
Alberto's impeccable bullshitting.

281
00:22:55,439 --> 00:22:58,648
...trying to wipe out some of the most
terrifying diseases of the 20th...

282
00:22:58,732 --> 00:23:02,027
-So you two are doctors?
-Well, no...

283
00:23:02,487 --> 00:23:05,197
Alberto is a biochemist and I'm in medical school.

284
00:23:05,365 --> 00:23:08,785
He practically has a degree.
We're as good as doctors.

285
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:12,745
Then I'd like you to look at this lump on my neck.

286
00:23:14,666 --> 00:23:16,709
-Mister...
-Von Puttkamer.

287
00:23:22,214 --> 00:23:23,424
Does it hurt?

288
00:23:27,052 --> 00:23:28,387
It's a tumour.

289
00:23:28,638 --> 00:23:29,637
What so you mean, a tumour?

290
00:23:29,724 --> 00:23:30,848
Yes.

291
00:23:32,057 --> 00:23:33,933
-You think so?
-Yeah.

292
00:23:37,898 --> 00:23:39,813
-I don't know, Fuser.
-I do.

293
00:23:39,898 --> 00:23:42,193
It looks like an adipose deposit,
it could be a cyst.

294
00:23:42,569 --> 00:23:44,237
No. It's a tumour.

295
00:23:44,696 --> 00:23:48,698
It's a tumour in the occipital zone,
probably of hydatid origin.

296
00:23:49,576 --> 00:23:53,077
Schatzie, these gentlemen say I have a tumour!

297
00:23:53,245 --> 00:23:55,538
No... Good day, ma'am.

298
00:23:55,623 --> 00:23:59,084
Honestly, I don't think it's a tumour,
it's a sebaceous cyst.

299
00:23:59,252 --> 00:24:02,420
If you'll give us some food and a place
to crash, we may be able to treat you.

300
00:24:02,505 --> 00:24:04,340
No, look, we can't treat you.

301
00:24:04,967 --> 00:24:06,883
Don't worry, you just need to go to Buenos Aires,

302
00:24:06,967 --> 00:24:09,011
I can recommend you to a specialist, but...

303
00:24:09,095 --> 00:24:10,804
We could try to help him.

304
00:24:12,308 --> 00:24:15,684
How? With a couple of herbs
from their garden? With prayers?

305
00:24:15,769 --> 00:24:18,354
I see, there's nothing you can do for me.

306
00:24:18,438 --> 00:24:21,022
Yes, we can. If you give us food
and a place to sleep...

307
00:24:21,106 --> 00:24:23,858
There's a lake full of fish and a tool shed nearby.

308
00:24:23,943 --> 00:24:25,611
Sir, it's a very premature diagnosis.

309
00:24:25,694 --> 00:24:27,780
This conversation is over, doctors.

310
00:24:29,533 --> 00:24:30,865
Let's go, Schatzie.

311
00:24:35,955 --> 00:24:38,958
Work with me next time, okay?

312
00:24:39,543 --> 00:24:42,627
Sure, I'll work with you
but not at the expense of a man's health.

313
00:24:42,711 --> 00:24:45,839
Let's suppose you were right,
the geezer had a tumour,

314
00:24:46,007 --> 00:24:48,217
how the fuck can you just tell him
like that? Unbelievable!

315
00:24:48,301 --> 00:24:51,262
It's the truth.
If he can't take it, that's his problem.

316
00:24:51,346 --> 00:24:54,641
You made him shit his pants,
you can't treat a patient like that.

317
00:24:54,725 --> 00:24:57,810
The guy has a tumour,
the sooner he deals with it, the better.

318
00:24:58,144 --> 00:25:01,648
It's the proper treatment,
or didn't you learn that in pharmacy school?

319
00:25:04,108 --> 00:25:07,444
Look, you idiot, don't talk to me
about proper medicine.

320
00:25:08,239 --> 00:25:10,697
You little nurse. Get your degree, then we'll talk.

321
00:25:10,823 --> 00:25:12,907
Fucking know-it-all.

322
00:25:13,033 --> 00:25:14,535
Let's look for food.

323
00:25:15,454 --> 00:25:18,496
Duck, duck, duck.
Give me the gun, man! Come on!

324
00:25:28,092 --> 00:25:29,843
-I got it, man!
-Very good!

325
00:25:30,594 --> 00:25:33,470
-How did you do that?
-Now we're totally fucked.

326
00:25:33,847 --> 00:25:37,434
Well, there is no choice now
but to jump in the lake and get our food.

327
00:25:37,518 --> 00:25:40,561
Fuser, jump in the water and get our food.

328
00:25:40,645 --> 00:25:43,357
You're nuts if you think I'm getting in.
Do you have any idea how cold it is?

329
00:25:43,524 --> 00:25:47,818
Yeah. I know you're allergic to the cold,
the water, the heat and all that...

330
00:25:47,902 --> 00:25:52,489
but you know what? I'm older,
wiser, and I did all the shooting.

331
00:25:52,574 --> 00:25:54,366
It was dumb luck! Besides, I have asthma.

332
00:25:54,451 --> 00:25:57,829
Okay, you're right. If you can't, I'll do it.

333
00:25:57,913 --> 00:26:00,622
-I never said "can't."
-"Can't," "won't"...

334
00:26:00,875 --> 00:26:02,207
-What's the difference?
-I didn't say, "I can't."

335
00:26:02,333 --> 00:26:04,211
Or don't want to, same thing.

336
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:07,004
Otherwise, give me Chichina's dollars,

337
00:26:07,715 --> 00:26:09,131
and we'll feast like kings.

338
00:26:09,508 --> 00:26:12,510
Look, if I get that fucking duck,
I'll eat it by myself.

339
00:26:12,637 --> 00:26:15,387
Like a duck to water, quack, quack, quack!

340
00:26:16,891 --> 00:26:18,476
I'm freezing my balls off!

341
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,559
So what? You're not using them.

342
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,561
Come on.

343
00:26:25,065 --> 00:26:28,316
Good, Fuser! Good! Bring that ducky with fries...

344
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,693
Is it cold out there?

345
00:26:29,819 --> 00:26:31,738
Hey! You cold?

346
00:26:31,988 --> 00:26:33,406
I'm not.

347
00:26:36,202 --> 00:26:37,242
Duck?

348
00:26:41,414 --> 00:26:42,580
Are you feeling shitty?

349
00:26:44,042 --> 00:26:45,835
No, I feel wonderful.

350
00:26:56,889 --> 00:26:57,930
Here.

351
00:27:03,186 --> 00:27:04,187
Fuser...

352
00:27:22,082 --> 00:27:23,123
Okay...

353
00:27:25,459 --> 00:27:27,460
Fuser, listen to me.

354
00:27:28,378 --> 00:27:31,963
Give me Chichina's fifteen dollars
and we'll go to a real hospital.

355
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:36,429
Ask again and I'll vomit on you.

356
00:28:22,099 --> 00:28:26,352
Dear Mum, what do we leave behind
when we cross a frontier?

357
00:28:27,104 --> 00:28:29,522
Each moment seems split in two:

358
00:28:30,066 --> 00:28:37,031
melancholy for what is left behind,
and the excitement of entering a new land.

359
00:28:40,534 --> 00:28:41,742
Look, Mial!

360
00:28:42,579 --> 00:28:43,620
Chile.

361
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:44,997
Chile!

362
00:28:45,414 --> 00:28:47,291
Long live Chile!

363
00:28:50,127 --> 00:28:53,672
-Is it the first time you've left the country?
-Yes.

364
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:55,465
You're practically a man.

365
00:28:57,718 --> 00:29:00,513
Listen, when we're old and tired of travelling,

366
00:29:01,514 --> 00:29:05,434
we should come back
and set up a clinic on this lake.

367
00:29:06,435 --> 00:29:09,229
-Huh?
-Not a bad idea.

368
00:29:09,522 --> 00:29:13,067
We'd treat everybody.
If anybody comes out here...

369
00:29:13,276 --> 00:29:14,902
Count me in, brother.

370
00:29:16,779 --> 00:29:18,905
Things are looking up, Fuser.

371
00:29:21,035 --> 00:29:25,370
-Is that snow piling up?
-Nah, that's just a little frost, man.

372
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:50,771
One, two, three...

373
00:29:53,149 --> 00:29:54,442
That's it!

374
00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:57,611
I hope the chain doesn't freeze up
because we'll be screwed...

375
00:29:58,696 --> 00:29:59,738
Come on!

376
00:30:03,327 --> 00:30:05,077
Come on! Come on! Come on!

377
00:30:06,036 --> 00:30:07,037
There you go...

378
00:30:11,585 --> 00:30:13,669
Fuck, it's cold.

379
00:30:14,628 --> 00:30:16,171
Nice little summer we're having...

380
00:30:34,315 --> 00:30:36,902
Hey, you said we'd enter Chile like conquerors,

381
00:30:36,986 --> 00:30:40,487
-not like a pair of assholes.
-If you don't like it, go fuck yourself, Ernesto.

382
00:30:40,863 --> 00:30:43,742
Why don't we dump this thing?
It's nothing but trouble.

383
00:30:43,826 --> 00:30:46,827
Oh, yeah? And travel the whole continent
on foot, genius?

384
00:30:46,912 --> 00:30:51,373
Yes. We'd see more, meet more people...

385
00:30:51,458 --> 00:30:53,251
you could lose a few pounds.

386
00:30:53,336 --> 00:30:56,962
Come on, you queer, with a couple of
Chichina's dollars, this is history.

387
00:30:57,046 --> 00:30:59,507
Same old song! Forget the money!

388
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,260
If that's your answer,
you go to Venezuela on foot,

389
00:31:03,345 --> 00:31:06,307
just leave me the hell alone
and take your boss's money.

390
00:31:06,391 --> 00:31:10,351
I could probably make it there in half
the time if you'd mind your own business.

391
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:12,103
You motherfucker!

392
00:31:15,898 --> 00:31:19,860
Ooh, Ernestito, bring me
those Yankee panties, from Miami...

393
00:31:20,489 --> 00:31:22,279
Don't you realise you'll never
see her wearing them,

394
00:31:22,364 --> 00:31:24,865
and she'll never take them off for you, asshole!

395
00:31:27,454 --> 00:31:28,453
Fuser!

396
00:31:33,209 --> 00:31:37,627
You know what your problem is, Fuser?
Your fucking honesty.

397
00:31:39,214 --> 00:31:42,092
You could help out
with a little lie once in a while.

398
00:31:43,551 --> 00:31:45,303
AUSTRAL NEWSPAPER

399
00:31:45,387 --> 00:31:47,472
Just hold it.

400
00:31:49,225 --> 00:31:50,224
Hey!

401
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:52,268
What are you doing?

402
00:31:53,186 --> 00:31:54,187
What's up?

403
00:31:54,313 --> 00:31:55,940
Come in!

404
00:32:03,531 --> 00:32:04,989
Thank you.

405
00:32:05,489 --> 00:32:06,907
-Maté?
-Yes.

406
00:32:07,158 --> 00:32:09,201
-Thank you very much.
-No sugar.

407
00:32:09,285 --> 00:32:10,912
-What is your name?
-Teresa.

408
00:32:10,997 --> 00:32:13,747
-Teresa. Ernesto.
-Nice to meet you.

409
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:17,293
There, hold it up.

410
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,003
It'll make a nice souvenir.

411
00:32:19,087 --> 00:32:21,882
A souvenir, huh?
I'll take it back to Argentina with me.

412
00:32:21,966 --> 00:32:24,176
-Are you travelling?
-Yeah, we are.

413
00:32:24,261 --> 00:32:25,926
We're the ones with that beat-up bike out there.

414
00:32:26,052 --> 00:32:27,554
-Oh, that big one over there?
-Yeah.

415
00:32:27,638 --> 00:32:30,264
-And what is this?
-Mussels.

416
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:32,267
-And these? These are clams, no?
-They're clams.

417
00:32:32,393 --> 00:32:35,686
-Just normal clams?
-Clams are always clams.

418
00:32:36,772 --> 00:32:37,940
Maybe next time.

419
00:32:43,195 --> 00:32:48,450
The Austral News!
The Austral News for only 3 pesos!

420
00:32:48,534 --> 00:32:52,954
News of Chile and the world, the Austral News!

421
00:32:53,164 --> 00:32:54,663
Just 3 pesos!

422
00:32:54,997 --> 00:32:57,625
News of Chile and the world, the Austral News!

423
00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:00,462
Yesterday afternoon,
Temuco was honoured by the arrival

424
00:33:00,546 --> 00:33:03,630
of two of the most prestigious leprosy experts
in South America.

425
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:06,926
Dr Alberto Granados from Córdoba...

426
00:33:07,011 --> 00:33:09,429
-What do you mean, "Granados?"
-Yeah, that's what it says.

427
00:33:09,513 --> 00:33:14,601
And Dr Ernesto Guevara de la Serna
from Buenos Aires,

428
00:33:14,685 --> 00:33:19,189
have embarked on an epic journey from their
native soil to the northern tip of Venezuela.

429
00:33:19,356 --> 00:33:23,318
The charismatic scientists-adventurers,
experts in their field,

430
00:33:23,444 --> 00:33:26,321
have treated 3000 patients across the continent.

431
00:33:26,489 --> 00:33:27,615
All right!

432
00:33:28,949 --> 00:33:30,867
They expect to complete their marathon-trek

433
00:33:30,951 --> 00:33:32,827
in a record-setting five months,

434
00:33:32,912 --> 00:33:37,208
just in time to celebrate the youthful,
Dr Granados' 30th birthday.

435
00:33:37,334 --> 00:33:41,003
-It says "youthful."
-Yeah, they lied a bit too.

436
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:42,837
Think it'll work?

437
00:33:55,685 --> 00:33:58,185
Hello. Good afternoon.

438
00:33:59,605 --> 00:34:02,149
My friend and I are having problems
with our bike.

439
00:34:02,234 --> 00:34:05,319
The steering is broken, the brakes are shot...

440
00:34:05,403 --> 00:34:09,323
-and the gears are all messed up.
-My ass is killing me.

441
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:13,284
Well, the steering, brakes and gears I can fix...

442
00:34:13,869 --> 00:34:17,164
but I'm afraid your ass is out of luck.

443
00:34:18,415 --> 00:34:20,083
And we're broke.

444
00:34:22,253 --> 00:34:25,630
What? You don't have a penny?

445
00:34:25,713 --> 00:34:28,259
We're getting some money in Valparaíso,

446
00:34:28,343 --> 00:34:29,717
we'll send it to you then.

447
00:34:29,802 --> 00:34:31,761
I have no disrespect in my heart...

448
00:34:31,846 --> 00:34:34,806
but if you have no money,
you have no business being here.

449
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:38,644
Forgive me for interrupting, sir,
but if you help us out now,

450
00:34:38,727 --> 00:34:42,314
you'd be doing incalculable service to
bilateral relations among our countries.

451
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:46,901
-You expect me to fix it for free?
-I don't think we're being clear.

452
00:34:46,985 --> 00:34:51,575
We can't assume everyone will know who's
who in the Latin American medical field.

453
00:34:51,658 --> 00:34:54,660
-Doctor, if you will.
-Yes, of course...as it so happens...

454
00:34:54,744 --> 00:35:01,625
an article came out just today
in The Austral...the newspaper.

455
00:35:08,423 --> 00:35:09,757
Allow me.

456
00:35:15,346 --> 00:35:16,431
Look, Piedad.

457
00:35:19,395 --> 00:35:20,561
Tulio!

458
00:35:21,437 --> 00:35:24,732
-The picture isn't very good.
-Yeah, it's not very flattering.

459
00:35:25,775 --> 00:35:26,902
It's them.

460
00:35:29,779 --> 00:35:32,615
Gentlemen, it would be an honour
to fix your motorcycle.

461
00:35:32,866 --> 00:35:33,742
Thank you very much.

462
00:35:33,826 --> 00:35:35,783
After I finish playing this card game
with my wife, of course.

463
00:35:35,868 --> 00:35:37,203
Of course.

464
00:35:37,454 --> 00:35:39,288
Priority number one!

465
00:35:40,917 --> 00:35:43,124
You know, there's a dance
at the City Hall tonight...

466
00:35:43,292 --> 00:35:45,920
and God willing, all the young girls
in town will be there.

467
00:35:46,087 --> 00:35:48,006
That's too bad!

468
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:49,964
Should I bring the bike in later?

469
00:35:50,049 --> 00:35:52,385
Leave it right here, we'll fix it up for you.

470
00:36:00,518 --> 00:36:08,194
My love, I'm gonna buy...
a little plane for us to fly

471
00:36:08,861 --> 00:36:09,985
Allow me...

472
00:36:10,111 --> 00:36:13,279
during our sweet honeymoon, my love

473
00:36:13,364 --> 00:36:20,161
My love, I'm gonna buy...
a little train to take a ride

474
00:36:20,831 --> 00:36:24,500
during our sweet honeymoon

475
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,379
Listen to his voice as he walks on

476
00:36:29,005 --> 00:36:31,839
he sings us Chipi Chipi
to dance along!

477
00:36:32,927 --> 00:36:37,305
-Chipi Chipi...
-Hey...

478
00:36:37,515 --> 00:36:40,432
Learn to dance the rhythm
of the Chipi Chipi...

479
00:37:07,168 --> 00:37:10,380
You know, I was just thinking about you...

480
00:37:11,633 --> 00:37:13,049
Yeah? Why?

481
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:17,512
You made a strong impression on me
from the start.

482
00:37:21,934 --> 00:37:23,058
Thanks.

483
00:37:28,689 --> 00:37:29,940
Do you want to dance?

484
00:37:32,904 --> 00:37:34,903
No...I don't dance.

485
00:37:35,738 --> 00:37:39,283
My husband's fallen asleep. He's drunk.

486
00:37:39,786 --> 00:37:41,744
I have no one to dance with.

487
00:37:42,828 --> 00:37:45,915
Well, if you teach me.

488
00:37:46,374 --> 00:37:47,417
Yes?

489
00:38:06,063 --> 00:38:08,439
You finally remembered you're a man, huh?

490
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,439
Oh, had you forgotten?

491
00:38:11,609 --> 00:38:13,443
I haven't danced for a long time...

492
00:38:14,821 --> 00:38:17,071
but it's all coming back.

493
00:38:29,752 --> 00:38:31,502
I can't dance any more.

494
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:38,342
Do you want to keep dancing?

495
00:38:40,137 --> 00:38:41,721
Wouldn't you like to step out?

496
00:38:44,183 --> 00:38:47,476
-I'd love to.
-Yes.

497
00:38:47,685 --> 00:38:49,731
-Yeah, let's go.
-Okay, let's go then.

498
00:38:53,651 --> 00:38:55,777
-What's wrong?
-Not now!

499
00:38:58,197 --> 00:38:59,905
-Come on, it's okay.
-Let me go!

500
00:39:00,866 --> 00:39:03,159
Hey, asshole, the Argentinian
is hitting on your wife!

501
00:39:03,577 --> 00:39:04,912
Let me go!

502
00:39:04,996 --> 00:39:06,662
I'm sorry, excuse me!

503
00:39:06,788 --> 00:39:08,872
You motherfucking Argentinian!

504
00:39:10,042 --> 00:39:11,127
Fuser!

505
00:39:12,003 --> 00:39:14,671
I'm gonna get you,
you Argentinian son-of-a-bitch!

506
00:39:22,471 --> 00:39:24,639
You Argentinian bastards!

507
00:39:28,353 --> 00:39:29,893
Let's get them!

508
00:39:32,816 --> 00:39:35,065
-Fucking shit!
-The chain!

509
00:39:36,527 --> 00:39:38,194
Hit it, hit it!

510
00:39:39,531 --> 00:39:41,197
-Yeah!
-Yes!

511
00:39:41,323 --> 00:39:42,949
Faster, faster!

512
00:39:59,886 --> 00:40:01,093
Are you tired?

513
00:40:01,553 --> 00:40:02,719
No.

514
00:40:02,969 --> 00:40:04,429
Do you want to switch?

515
00:40:04,513 --> 00:40:05,473
No.

516
00:40:05,557 --> 00:40:07,017
Are you sure?

517
00:40:24,951 --> 00:40:27,244
Cows!

518
00:40:27,537 --> 00:40:29,371
-Hit the brakes!
-What brakes?

519
00:40:29,915 --> 00:40:31,957
-What do you mean?
-The brakes are gone!

520
00:40:32,416 --> 00:40:33,792
Fucking mechanic!

521
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,476
You all right?

522
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,103
I'm great! What do you want me to say, Fuser?

523
00:40:59,694 --> 00:41:01,446
Goddamn mechanic!

524
00:41:33,852 --> 00:41:35,020
Is he your dad?

525
00:41:36,774 --> 00:41:37,773
Yes.

526
00:41:45,242 --> 00:41:46,824
That cow's going blind.

527
00:41:50,705 --> 00:41:52,622
All she's going to see is shit.

528
00:42:13,728 --> 00:42:16,561
We are 25 days behind schedule.

529
00:42:26,906 --> 00:42:28,074
Hello...

530
00:42:28,993 --> 00:42:31,744
It is rumoured that Chilean girls are
the most daring in the continent.

531
00:42:31,828 --> 00:42:36,957
Rumours have no scientific value,
Dr Granado. Time to do some research.

532
00:42:38,877 --> 00:42:40,086
-Don't you like him?
-No.

533
00:42:40,171 --> 00:42:42,047
You don't like either of them?

534
00:42:42,715 --> 00:42:43,881
Here they come.

535
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:49,804
Hi, girls.

536
00:42:50,555 --> 00:42:52,557
Excuse us, but this place is packed.

537
00:42:52,641 --> 00:42:54,934
-Can we join you?
-Yes.

538
00:42:55,018 --> 00:42:57,062
-You don't mind?
-Thank you.

539
00:42:57,188 --> 00:42:58,228
Hello.

540
00:42:58,646 --> 00:43:01,232
-Ernesto.
-He's Alberto.

541
00:43:02,026 --> 00:43:03,693
-Miss?
-Jazmin.

542
00:43:03,778 --> 00:43:05,652
-Daniela.
-A pleasure.

543
00:43:05,736 --> 00:43:06,945
A real pleasure.

544
00:43:07,656 --> 00:43:11,201
-Are you two Argentinian?
-How'd you know?

545
00:43:11,576 --> 00:43:15,413
Well, because of your accent,
because Argentinians always say "che"...

546
00:43:15,539 --> 00:43:18,333
-Had you noticed, che?
-Not at all, che.

547
00:43:21,544 --> 00:43:23,589
Do you know what day it is?

548
00:43:23,799 --> 00:43:28,300
February 26.

549
00:43:28,426 --> 00:43:31,596
Sounds unbelievable, but it's been a year.

550
00:43:31,889 --> 00:43:36,060
-A year since what?
-One year since we started this trip.

551
00:43:37,813 --> 00:43:42,272
One year, and we're flat broke,
we can't even celebrate. What a shame.

552
00:43:42,357 --> 00:43:44,860
Why don't you let us treat you
to a bottle of wine?

553
00:43:44,945 --> 00:43:46,444
-Wine?
-Wine...

554
00:43:46,779 --> 00:43:47,945
Lucho!

555
00:43:48,698 --> 00:43:53,827
A bottle of wine for our
courageous, Argentine visitors.

556
00:43:55,204 --> 00:43:59,375
Girls, don't be offended, but I can't drink wine.

557
00:44:00,126 --> 00:44:01,583
Why couldn't you drink just a bit?

558
00:44:01,668 --> 00:44:05,463
Exactly... There's an old custom in Argentina...

559
00:44:05,548 --> 00:44:07,132
No, please don't.

560
00:44:07,425 --> 00:44:08,465
What is it?

561
00:44:08,675 --> 00:44:13,848
-I think they deserve an explanation.
-They do.

562
00:44:13,932 --> 00:44:15,264
Thank you, Lucho.

563
00:44:15,765 --> 00:44:22,479
An old custom in Argentina doesn't
allow us to drink on an empty stomach.

564
00:44:22,939 --> 00:44:26,276
Since we're flat broke, we can't buy food

565
00:44:27,237 --> 00:44:32,575
and must reject your generous offer. That's it.

566
00:44:32,659 --> 00:44:35,452
Come on, lighten up.

567
00:44:35,536 --> 00:44:36,827
Lucho.

568
00:44:38,955 --> 00:44:40,917
Lucho, could you bring us some empanadas?

569
00:44:41,002 --> 00:44:44,126
-Do you like Chilean empanadas?
-I've never tasted Chilean empanadas.

570
00:44:44,210 --> 00:44:45,253
Four? Eight?

571
00:44:45,337 --> 00:44:46,547
Well...they do look hungry.

572
00:44:46,631 --> 00:44:47,714
Twelve.

573
00:44:47,842 --> 00:44:50,549
What a nice number.
I've always liked that number.

574
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:55,015
-Wish we could stay!
-Too bad we have nowhere to crash.

575
00:44:55,099 --> 00:44:56,681
We'll sleep out in the park.

576
00:44:56,766 --> 00:45:00,770
Listen...my dad's fond of Argentinians.

577
00:45:01,187 --> 00:45:04,272
-No joke!
-Honest. He might be able to help you.

578
00:45:05,023 --> 00:45:07,401
Since Dad's chief of the fire brigade,
he knows lots of people.

579
00:45:07,486 --> 00:45:09,653
What? You two are sisters?

580
00:45:10,738 --> 00:45:11,987
Of course.

581
00:45:13,365 --> 00:45:14,450
Look.

582
00:45:14,534 --> 00:45:16,286
Can't you tell?

583
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:20,538
The mechanic won't be in until tomorrow,
but the bike can stay right here.

584
00:45:20,664 --> 00:45:21,791
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you very much, Sir.

585
00:45:21,875 --> 00:45:23,709
Guys! Cañaco! Come!

586
00:45:23,835 --> 00:45:26,962
I'm going to introduce you
to two Argentinian volunteers

587
00:45:27,047 --> 00:45:28,714
that will be spending the night here with you.

588
00:45:28,799 --> 00:45:33,091
This is Doctor skinny Che,
and this is Doctor chubby Che.

589
00:45:33,176 --> 00:45:34,677
-Pleasure.
-Good to meet you.

590
00:45:34,762 --> 00:45:39,057
-Why don't we go take in the town?
-Good idea, but...

591
00:45:39,683 --> 00:45:41,726
Don't you worry, sir.

592
00:45:42,604 --> 00:45:44,731
Excuse me. Sorry!

593
00:45:45,732 --> 00:45:46,731
Hello.

594
00:45:48,068 --> 00:45:51,446
I don't want to bother you,
but are you really doctors?

595
00:45:51,531 --> 00:45:52,613
-No.
-Yes.

596
00:45:53,405 --> 00:45:54,990
Actually, I'm a biochemist.

597
00:45:55,075 --> 00:45:56,826
Could you come see a sick woman?

598
00:45:56,952 --> 00:46:00,620
-Yes. Whenever you say, just...
-Could we do it now?

599
00:46:00,746 --> 00:46:03,916
It's been a long time since she's
seen a doctor, she's really in bad shape.

600
00:46:04,042 --> 00:46:07,086
Sure. Let me get my things.

601
00:46:07,586 --> 00:46:11,090
Well, one has to remain faithful
to the Hippocratic oath...

602
00:46:11,966 --> 00:46:13,926
-Ernesto.
-Moncho.

603
00:46:14,135 --> 00:46:15,928
-Poncho?
-Moncho.

604
00:46:17,096 --> 00:46:18,264
Excuse me.

605
00:46:25,188 --> 00:46:26,398
Look me in the eye.

606
00:46:34,739 --> 00:46:36,655
I'm going to touch your neck.

607
00:46:45,332 --> 00:46:46,625
Has she eaten?

608
00:46:48,503 --> 00:46:49,878
I don't know.

609
00:47:18,826 --> 00:47:21,702
Look, Mrs Rosa,
I'm going to leave these little pills.

610
00:47:23,748 --> 00:47:28,084
Take one with each meal
and one before sleeping.

611
00:47:29,754 --> 00:47:31,837
This will help you feel better.

612
00:47:40,014 --> 00:47:45,142
I knew I was powerless to help her, Mum...

613
00:47:46,019 --> 00:47:50,022
This poor old woman who only a month ago
waited tables, wheezing like I do,

614
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,691
trying to live with dignity.

615
00:47:54,028 --> 00:47:57,948
In her dying eyes there was
a plea for forgiveness

616
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:03,161
and for solace, now vanished,

617
00:48:04,539 --> 00:48:09,918
just as her body will soon be lost,
in the great mystery that surrounds us.

618
00:48:17,593 --> 00:48:22,763
Fuser, you still haven't asked about
the research I did on our Chilean sisters.

619
00:48:23,723 --> 00:48:25,518
You can't imagine how depressed I am

620
00:48:25,602 --> 00:48:28,227
that you're the sexual ambassador of Argentina!

621
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:29,479
It's true.

622
00:48:29,563 --> 00:48:32,147
Are you the clowns that ride
that crippled piece of shit?

623
00:48:33,859 --> 00:48:35,733
Her name is "The Mighty One."

624
00:48:35,901 --> 00:48:36,902
Her name was "The Mighty One."

625
00:48:37,070 --> 00:48:40,490
Now she can be baptized "The Deceased,"
"The Dearly Departed," "The Paraplegic"...

626
00:48:40,574 --> 00:48:43,743
-Really? And why's that?
-Why?

627
00:48:43,869 --> 00:48:45,370
Because I am the mechanic.

628
00:48:45,579 --> 00:48:50,959
You could make a buck selling her
for scrap. Chile is her last stop.

629
00:49:07,517 --> 00:49:09,269
Gonna miss you, girl.

630
00:49:18,571 --> 00:49:21,114
I'll carry yours today. Come on.

631
00:49:27,788 --> 00:49:29,707
What'll we do? Go on?

632
00:49:30,291 --> 00:49:31,540
Of course.

633
00:49:31,708 --> 00:49:34,211
A man turns 30 only once, right?

634
00:49:42,344 --> 00:49:45,013
You're something else, Ernesto de la Serna...

635
00:49:45,847 --> 00:49:50,519
-I mean, if we spend Chichina's...
-Nope! Don't even think it.

636
00:49:59,819 --> 00:50:01,987
Hey! Hey!

637
00:50:03,491 --> 00:50:04,909
He stopped! Come on!

638
00:50:31,979 --> 00:50:33,728
There she is, Valparaíso.

639
00:50:34,771 --> 00:50:36,481
"I love Valparaíso,

640
00:50:37,107 --> 00:50:43,113
all you encompass, all you radiate,
lover of the ocean, far from..."

641
00:50:43,197 --> 00:50:45,949
-Federico García Lorca.
-No!

642
00:50:46,077 --> 00:50:47,284
Neruda!

643
00:51:07,265 --> 00:51:08,681
Thank you.

644
00:51:09,473 --> 00:51:12,100
-From Chichina?
-From Chichina. And the money?

645
00:51:14,105 --> 00:51:16,020
-Should I open it?
-Go ahead.

646
00:51:17,230 --> 00:51:19,567
I'll leave you lovebirds alone.

647
00:51:29,161 --> 00:51:31,286
I love you so much, Celia de la Serna.

648
00:51:38,962 --> 00:51:40,044
What happened?

649
00:51:45,176 --> 00:51:46,260
Fuser?

650
00:52:42,192 --> 00:52:44,526
-Hey, you ready?
-Me?

651
00:52:44,653 --> 00:52:47,238
-Yup.
-Of course...

652
00:52:47,322 --> 00:52:48,446
Right away!

653
00:53:30,656 --> 00:53:31,865
You know what?

654
00:53:31,950 --> 00:53:33,827
I liked my plan better, Fuser!

655
00:53:37,205 --> 00:53:40,333
You are such an arrogant bastard.
You could at least answer me!

656
00:53:42,545 --> 00:53:43,877
What do you wanna do? Go back?

657
00:53:44,545 --> 00:53:45,879
Go on, go back!

658
00:53:46,131 --> 00:53:49,218
I'll get to the mine and tell you all about it.

659
00:53:49,468 --> 00:53:51,843
Are you saying I can't make it?

660
00:53:53,471 --> 00:53:56,808
If you can, little asthmatic doctor, then I can.

661
00:53:56,892 --> 00:53:59,519
-Just shut up and walk!
-Pain in the ass!

662
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:01,354
Now you wanna beat me?

663
00:54:07,819 --> 00:54:09,905
Stop, goddamn it!

664
00:54:19,913 --> 00:54:21,874
Good afternoon, hi.

665
00:54:23,754 --> 00:54:25,961
I'm Ernesto, good to meet you.

666
00:54:37,224 --> 00:54:38,225
Yes.

667
00:54:38,893 --> 00:54:39,934
Right there.

668
00:54:41,354 --> 00:54:42,603
Home.

669
00:54:45,192 --> 00:54:48,025
We didn't have much, just some tough, dry land.

670
00:54:49,111 --> 00:54:50,737
It belonged to his grandpa.

671
00:54:51,907 --> 00:54:55,784
It was ours. Until a land speculator forced us off.

672
00:54:56,701 --> 00:54:58,620
That's what they call progress.

673
00:54:58,955 --> 00:55:02,791
So we had to leave our son
with our family and hit the road,

674
00:55:02,875 --> 00:55:04,709
looking for work,

675
00:55:04,794 --> 00:55:08,629
trying to escape from the police
who want to throw us in jail,

676
00:55:09,507 --> 00:55:10,507
Why?

677
00:55:11,718 --> 00:55:13,469
Because we are communists.

678
00:55:14,553 --> 00:55:15,761
Now we're going to a mine.

679
00:55:15,929 --> 00:55:18,224
If we're lucky, I'll find some work.

680
00:55:19,683 --> 00:55:23,143
It's so dangerous, they don't
care what party you belong to.

681
00:55:26,315 --> 00:55:28,650
Are you two looking for work?

682
00:55:28,901 --> 00:55:31,152
No, we're not looking for work.

683
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:32,822
No?

684
00:55:34,449 --> 00:55:36,324
Then why are you travelling?

685
00:55:40,915 --> 00:55:43,039
We traveljust to travel.

686
00:55:50,256 --> 00:55:51,757
Bless you...

687
00:55:54,385 --> 00:55:56,678
Blessed be your travels.

688
00:56:02,686 --> 00:56:05,102
-Here.
-Thank you.

689
00:56:07,691 --> 00:56:10,234
-Have a maté.
-Thank you.

690
00:56:12,068 --> 00:56:15,197
Their faces were tragic and haunting.

691
00:56:17,534 --> 00:56:21,620
They told us of comrades who had
mysteriously disappeared,

692
00:56:22,414 --> 00:56:25,790
and were said to be somewhere
at the bottom of the sea.

693
00:56:29,504 --> 00:56:32,630
It was one of the coldest nights of my life,

694
00:56:33,842 --> 00:56:40,723
but also one which made me feel closer
to this strange, for me anyway, human race.

695
00:56:51,903 --> 00:56:52,902
You!

696
00:56:53,861 --> 00:56:55,154
You, too.

697
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:57,823
You, over there.

698
00:56:58,534 --> 00:56:59,533
You.

699
00:57:05,541 --> 00:57:07,665
Not you! The one next to you!

700
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:11,378
Move it, move it! Get a move on, guys!

701
00:57:15,759 --> 00:57:19,596
You there, you too. Up there!

702
00:57:21,097 --> 00:57:22,555
Move along!

703
00:57:29,647 --> 00:57:31,566
The one in the back. You, too.

704
00:57:34,528 --> 00:57:36,611
The one up there, you.

705
00:57:37,155 --> 00:57:42,076
Hurry up. Get on the truck.

706
00:57:42,577 --> 00:57:44,036
The rest of you, go home!

707
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:46,997
Hurry up, move it!

708
00:57:48,292 --> 00:57:49,500
This truck is full...

709
00:58:03,598 --> 00:58:04,764
Hey, come on!

710
00:58:08,646 --> 00:58:11,312
You two! What are you doing here?

711
00:58:11,689 --> 00:58:14,317
-Nothing, just looking.
-Looking at what, asshole?

712
00:58:14,485 --> 00:58:16,695
This is not a tourist attraction, get lost!

713
00:58:16,903 --> 00:58:19,030
Don't you see these people are thirsty?

714
00:58:19,489 --> 00:58:21,324
Why don't you give them some water, damn it?

715
00:58:21,492 --> 00:58:24,702
Get out before I call security
and have you locked up, asshole.

716
00:58:24,786 --> 00:58:26,704
-What would they?
-Why?

717
00:58:26,788 --> 00:58:30,625
Trespassing. This is property
of the Anaconda Mining Company.

718
00:58:32,293 --> 00:58:33,460
Watch the door.

719
00:58:38,341 --> 00:58:39,549
You son-of-a-bitch!

720
00:59:06,370 --> 00:59:10,165
As we left Chuquicamata
we could feel the world changing

721
00:59:10,249 --> 00:59:11,876
or was it us?

722
00:59:14,419 --> 00:59:19,507
The deeper we go in the Andes,
the more indigenous people we encounter,

723
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:23,469
who are homeless in their own land.

724
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:31,770
We finally entered Peru,

725
00:59:31,854 --> 00:59:35,022
thanks to a half-blind trucker named Félix.

726
00:59:36,359 --> 00:59:42,655
And guess what? Alberto turned 30,
but not in Venezuela as he had planned.

727
00:59:44,491 --> 00:59:48,745
We were so tired, Mum, we couldn't celebrate.

728
00:59:53,417 --> 00:59:54,418
Fuser...

729
00:59:58,214 --> 01:00:00,090
This is not humanly possible.

730
01:00:26,492 --> 01:00:30,161
We finally arrived in Cuzco,
"the heart of America."

731
01:00:35,835 --> 01:00:39,128
Our first day in the city we met Don Néstor,

732
01:00:39,755 --> 01:00:43,259
an old soul, Mum, and our official guide.

733
01:00:43,343 --> 01:00:46,343
Sir, I wonder, which of these walls is Incan?

734
01:00:46,430 --> 01:00:49,097
This one here is Incan and that one is Spanish.

735
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:52,975
As a joke we say this wall was made by the Inca,

736
01:00:53,059 --> 01:00:56,646
and that wall was made by the In-capables.
That's what we call the Spanish.

737
01:00:58,066 --> 01:01:02,319
Curing the Inca period, Cuzco was the capital.

738
01:01:02,404 --> 01:01:05,905
When the Spanish came
they started to trash it all,

739
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:09,074
-and made Lima the capital.
-Lima?

740
01:01:09,159 --> 01:01:10,577
Yes.

741
01:01:12,830 --> 01:01:14,582
This belongs to Jesus Christ Inc.

742
01:01:14,666 --> 01:01:16,667
-Are they still in business?
-Yes.

743
01:01:18,296 --> 01:01:19,878
Are they still in business...?

744
01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:32,808
She says she never went to school

745
01:01:32,893 --> 01:01:37,938
because she was always with the livestock,

746
01:01:38,023 --> 01:01:41,775
and that's why she doesn't speak Spanish,
only Quechua.

747
01:01:41,984 --> 01:01:44,904
When I was little there was enough,
at least I think so,

748
01:01:44,988 --> 01:01:48,448
there was enough money to afford everything.

749
01:01:48,616 --> 01:01:54,163
But now I think there is little money,
there is no work.

750
01:01:55,122 --> 01:01:59,210
And this is all affecting us, more and more.

751
01:01:59,669 --> 01:02:03,545
From the time I was little
I've worked with handicrafts, and,

752
01:02:03,630 --> 01:02:11,013
that's why I'm not doing too bad,
not too good, just okay.

753
01:02:50,971 --> 01:02:53,013
With both hands.

754
01:02:56,059 --> 01:02:58,269
With both hands, Néstor.

755
01:03:01,146 --> 01:03:02,523
Thank you.

756
01:03:12,701 --> 01:03:13,700
Hello.

757
01:03:17,707 --> 01:03:18,789
Good afternoon.

758
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:24,754
I was working for a time...

759
01:03:25,172 --> 01:03:26,255
on some land.

760
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:30,302
And the landlord... kicked me off the land.

761
01:03:31,303 --> 01:03:34,888
I was doing my work and he threw me out.

762
01:03:34,974 --> 01:03:37,183
How'd he throw you out? Did he bring the police?

763
01:03:37,268 --> 01:03:39,686
Yes, he brought the police.

764
01:03:39,770 --> 01:03:42,563
Because he's rich, he's got lots of money.

765
01:03:42,647 --> 01:03:45,651
He wants me to vacate his land, to get out.

766
01:03:45,902 --> 01:03:47,484
Once it was already productive.

767
01:03:47,569 --> 01:03:53,158
Yes, it was producing wheat,
corn, potato...all that.

768
01:03:53,242 --> 01:03:55,408
And he kept most of it.

769
01:03:55,492 --> 01:04:00,373
So, I can't live in the past.
I have to move on...work,

770
01:04:00,458 --> 01:04:05,128
find the money to bring up my kids...

771
01:04:05,212 --> 01:04:07,714
-How many kids do you have?
-I've got five.

772
01:04:07,798 --> 01:04:10,425
Have you got organised with other farm workers...

773
01:04:10,509 --> 01:04:11,927
-Yes.
-In order to fight back?

774
01:04:12,011 --> 01:04:18,140
Yes. We are organised, we help
each other, work our land,

775
01:04:18,224 --> 01:04:21,811
we help each other. Very unified.

776
01:05:30,131 --> 01:05:32,048
Ready for the photo, Fuser?

777
01:05:32,842 --> 01:05:34,133
That's it, that's it...

778
01:05:36,011 --> 01:05:37,303
This one's for posterity.

779
01:05:41,976 --> 01:05:48,188
The Incas knew about astronomy, medicine,
mathematics among other things,

780
01:05:48,273 --> 01:05:51,151
but the Spanish invaders had gunpowder.

781
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:56,448
What would America look like today
if things had been different?

782
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:58,993
Fuser, here's my idea:

783
01:06:00,202 --> 01:06:02,455
I'll marry an Inca descendant.

784
01:06:02,538 --> 01:06:05,290
We'll start an indigenous party
under these conditions:

785
01:06:05,750 --> 01:06:08,001
we'd encourage the people to vote,

786
01:06:08,626 --> 01:06:12,505
reactivate Tupac Amaru's revolution,
the Indo-American revolution, Fuser.

787
01:06:12,967 --> 01:06:14,424
How's that sound?

788
01:06:15,675 --> 01:06:17,260
A revolution without guns?

789
01:06:18,638 --> 01:06:20,514
It would never work, Mial.

790
01:06:35,072 --> 01:06:39,032
How is it possible to feel nostalgia
for a world I never knew?

791
01:06:41,162 --> 01:06:44,830
How can a civilisation that built this...

792
01:06:45,831 --> 01:06:47,999
be destroyed to build...

793
01:06:48,585 --> 01:06:49,793
this...?

794
01:07:10,857 --> 01:07:12,858
-This isn't it.
-No?

795
01:07:13,859 --> 01:07:16,027
Wrong street ?

796
01:07:20,866 --> 01:07:22,034
Mercaderes 52.

797
01:07:22,494 --> 01:07:23,745
Let's ask.

798
01:07:23,830 --> 01:07:26,370
-Calle Mercaderes?
-Mercaderes?

799
01:07:26,454 --> 01:07:30,752
Straight ahead for two blocks,
turn right and go another six, seven blocks.

800
01:07:31,002 --> 01:07:32,544
This has got to be Mercaderes.

801
01:07:33,713 --> 01:07:35,130
That one is, too.

802
01:07:35,508 --> 01:07:36,965
-Is this Mercaderes?
-Yes.

803
01:07:37,049 --> 01:07:38,676
-And that one?
-Yes.

804
01:07:40,971 --> 01:07:43,430
We have to count backwards.

805
01:07:43,723 --> 01:07:45,641
-Fuser?
-Backwards is 2, 4,...

806
01:07:45,725 --> 01:07:47,768
What? Yeah...

807
01:07:52,274 --> 01:07:54,232
Can I help you?

808
01:07:57,362 --> 01:08:01,114
This is Mariátegui's book.
And you must also read César Vallejo.

809
01:08:01,365 --> 01:08:04,118
The best thing about Lima was Dr Hugo Pesce,

810
01:08:04,494 --> 01:08:07,329
Director of Peru's leper treatment programme

811
01:08:07,414 --> 01:08:10,290
who Alberto contacted
before we started out journey.

812
01:08:10,585 --> 01:08:15,420
He gave us clothes, food, money and ideas.

813
01:08:17,214 --> 01:08:21,051
Mariátegui speaks of the revolutionary potential

814
01:08:21,136 --> 01:08:23,762
of the natives and farm workers of Latin America.

815
01:08:24,388 --> 01:08:27,766
He says the problem of the Indian
is the problem of the land,

816
01:08:28,018 --> 01:08:31,519
and that the revolution
should not be an imitation.

817
01:08:31,604 --> 01:08:33,773
It should be original and indigenous.

818
01:08:59,465 --> 01:09:02,302
"There are too few of us to be divided," he said,

819
01:09:02,803 --> 01:09:04,302
"Everything unites us...

820
01:09:05,597 --> 01:09:06,932
"nothing separates us."

821
01:09:07,016 --> 01:09:08,768
Most of the patients are over here.

822
01:09:11,602 --> 01:09:13,980
Pesce got us a couple of beds
in the Guia Hospital,

823
01:09:14,065 --> 01:09:17,691
where patients suffering from
the early stages of leprosy are treated.

824
01:09:18,734 --> 01:09:22,907
The most critical cases are sent
to the San Pablo Leper Colony, in the Amazon.

825
01:09:22,990 --> 01:09:25,615
Zoraida, this is Alberto and Ernesto.

826
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:28,453
I think we know each other pretty well now...

827
01:09:28,537 --> 01:09:30,538
Let me tell you something.

828
01:09:30,957 --> 01:09:35,252
I look at you, Ernesto, and you, Alberto...

829
01:09:35,336 --> 01:09:39,380
and I see great idealism and many doubts.

830
01:09:40,258 --> 01:09:42,550
That's why I'm glad you're going to San Pablo.

831
01:09:42,843 --> 01:09:45,386
I think you will find something important there.

832
01:09:45,804 --> 01:09:47,597
For each of you.

833
01:09:48,848 --> 01:09:50,516
Thank you, Doctor.

834
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:53,685
If you'll excuse me, I will show you something.

835
01:09:54,605 --> 01:09:57,481
Another surprise? So many surprises...

836
01:09:58,193 --> 01:10:00,401
-What's he getting, squirt?
-A book.

837
01:10:00,485 --> 01:10:02,569
-A book...
-You have quite an appetite, Lito.

838
01:10:04,364 --> 01:10:09,368
This is the great love of my life,
after my wife, of course.

839
01:10:10,538 --> 01:10:12,164
It's my novel.

840
01:10:12,665 --> 01:10:15,039
"Latitudes of Silence"

841
01:10:15,876 --> 01:10:18,169
I hope you'll do me the honour of reading it.

842
01:10:18,254 --> 01:10:20,963
-Of course.
-Of course, Doctor.

843
01:10:21,047 --> 01:10:22,046
The honour is ours.

844
01:10:22,131 --> 01:10:24,093
You can give me your opinion in Ucayali.

845
01:10:24,177 --> 01:10:26,429
-Of course. May I?
-Of course.

846
01:10:26,513 --> 01:10:28,053
Who dares go first?

847
01:10:29,179 --> 01:10:30,139
Both of us.

848
01:10:30,223 --> 01:10:34,686
He reads much faster than me.
He's really a fast reader.

849
01:10:37,397 --> 01:10:40,234
Well, boys, that's the ship, "La Cenepa."

850
01:10:40,694 --> 01:10:42,651
You'll be in San Pablo in 5 days.

851
01:10:42,777 --> 01:10:44,237
All aboard!

852
01:10:44,904 --> 01:10:46,197
Maestro...

853
01:10:47,992 --> 01:10:52,121
Thank you for your hospitality,
for the tickets, for the clothes.

854
01:10:52,205 --> 01:10:54,540
Thank you for everything. It's been an honour.

855
01:10:54,624 --> 01:10:55,915
Don't mention it.

856
01:10:56,207 --> 01:10:59,627
Thank you. Thank you very much.

857
01:10:59,754 --> 01:11:03,464
One more thing, haven't
you forgotten something?

858
01:11:04,090 --> 01:11:06,260
You haven't said anything about my novel.

859
01:11:09,430 --> 01:11:11,096
-You've read it?
-Of course.

860
01:11:11,181 --> 01:11:13,434
-And?
-What can I say?

861
01:11:14,602 --> 01:11:17,478
I can say, without exaggeration, that no one...

862
01:11:17,562 --> 01:11:19,356
can tell a story like you do.

863
01:11:20,858 --> 01:11:23,027
It took me a lot of work.

864
01:11:23,111 --> 01:11:24,443
Ernesto, your opinion?

865
01:11:24,569 --> 01:11:25,779
He loved it.

866
01:11:25,863 --> 01:11:28,782
If he loved it, I'd like to hear him tell me.

867
01:11:32,285 --> 01:11:35,538
Look, Doctor, I think your book is a bit trite,

868
01:11:35,956 --> 01:11:41,295
there are too many clichés, and I...

869
01:11:41,963 --> 01:11:44,006
Well, that's not so bad...

870
01:11:44,091 --> 01:11:47,634
No...the writing is basically - bad.

871
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:50,222
Basically unreadable.

872
01:11:52,806 --> 01:11:57,062
It's a worthy attempt, Doctor, but I think
you should stick to what you know best.

873
01:11:59,979 --> 01:12:02,983
I'm sorry, Maestro,
you asked my opinion and that's it.

874
01:12:06,654 --> 01:12:08,113
Damn you, boy...

875
01:12:08,322 --> 01:12:10,657
Nobody's been this honest with me.

876
01:12:11,033 --> 01:12:13,076
You're the only one.

877
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:15,286
The only one.

878
01:12:17,332 --> 01:12:19,999
Well, I won't keep you any longer.

879
01:12:20,251 --> 01:12:23,712
So long, we're forever grateful. Thank you.

880
01:12:24,339 --> 01:12:25,632
Take care!

881
01:14:21,957 --> 01:14:23,707
Have you seen...

882
01:14:23,792 --> 01:14:24,960
a bag that was just here?

883
01:14:25,086 --> 01:14:27,835
-No.
-A small brown one.

884
01:14:28,421 --> 01:14:29,629
I'll bring it over if I do.

885
01:14:43,311 --> 01:14:44,937
What's wrong with him?

886
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:47,439
Call for help!

887
01:14:54,698 --> 01:14:55,697
The pillow!

888
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:58,785
Hand me the pillow!

889
01:15:06,251 --> 01:15:08,253
Take it easy, Fuser.

890
01:15:14,844 --> 01:15:17,345
Take it easy, Fuser. Adrenaline on the way...

891
01:15:33,030 --> 01:15:36,448
Okay, Fuser. It's over...

892
01:15:43,706 --> 01:15:47,250
Fuser, Fuser, quiet. It's all over now.

893
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:07,561
Miss...

894
01:16:09,148 --> 01:16:12,983
I want to thank you for helping out my friend.

895
01:16:13,068 --> 01:16:15,027
No problem. He was in really bad shape.

896
01:16:15,111 --> 01:16:16,154
Fuck, yeah.

897
01:16:16,322 --> 01:16:18,156
-He scared me a lot.
-Me too.

898
01:16:18,449 --> 01:16:20,408
Thank you very much, Miss.

899
01:16:22,204 --> 01:16:24,747
You know, a little while ago
there was a bufeo out there.

900
01:16:24,831 --> 01:16:25,830
A bufeo?

901
01:16:25,915 --> 01:16:28,749
They're river dolphins but we call them bufeos.

902
01:16:29,211 --> 01:16:30,335
Have you ever seen one?

903
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:33,213
Never. I've heard of them,
but I've never seen one.

904
01:16:34,924 --> 01:16:37,717
I'm going to tell you a secret.

905
01:16:38,762 --> 01:16:42,930
The bufeo's sex organs
are like that of a woman's...

906
01:16:43,014 --> 01:16:47,018
and the Indians use them to...
comfort themselves.

907
01:16:47,394 --> 01:16:49,604
But there's a little problem.

908
01:16:49,689 --> 01:16:52,525
As soon as they're done,
they have to kill the animal...

909
01:16:52,609 --> 01:16:55,819
because they suffer contractions
that won't release them.

910
01:17:01,783 --> 01:17:04,034
-Miss, if I may, can I ask you a question?
-Shoot.

911
01:17:04,119 --> 01:17:05,203
Shoot.

912
01:17:05,287 --> 01:17:08,081
What brings you to these inhospitable waters?

913
01:17:08,165 --> 01:17:09,456
I work on the boat.

914
01:17:09,626 --> 01:17:11,961
I come and go between Pucallpa and Leticia.

915
01:17:12,045 --> 01:17:13,130
I'm from Pucallpa.

916
01:17:13,297 --> 01:17:14,838
-Pucallpan.
-Pucallpian.

917
01:17:14,922 --> 01:17:16,881
-Pucallpian, got it.
-Have you been there?

918
01:17:17,007 --> 01:17:19,176
Yes, it's full of beautiful women,
but you are the loveliest.

919
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:21,262
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

920
01:17:21,762 --> 01:17:23,137
And how do you pay for your passage?

921
01:17:23,346 --> 01:17:25,641
I give the captain part of my earnings.

922
01:17:26,559 --> 01:17:30,646
And...how do you earn your earnings, Miss?

923
01:17:33,316 --> 01:17:38,194
Let's just say...if we go to your cabin,
I can show you.

924
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:43,991
The name's Luz, in case you want to
know who you're doing business with.

925
01:17:45,578 --> 01:17:49,956
My little Luz, for a night with you
I'd pay enough gold to equal the Aconcagua.

926
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:53,836
But, honey, I've run out of cash.

927
01:17:53,962 --> 01:17:56,338
Well, my friend, in that case
you'll have to excuse me.

928
01:17:56,506 --> 01:17:59,008
-Hey...
-I've gotta go earn a living.

929
01:17:59,092 --> 01:18:00,968
You're not going to leave me like this, are you?

930
01:18:12,687 --> 01:18:14,857
-I need the fifteen dollars, Fuser.
-What?

931
01:18:15,025 --> 01:18:16,191
Her name is Luz.

932
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:19,401
She told me a story of a fish
the Indians fuck and kissed me,

933
01:18:19,527 --> 01:18:20,904
I'm so horny I could explode.

934
01:18:21,865 --> 01:18:23,366
I spent them.

935
01:18:23,701 --> 01:18:24,700
No, Fuser.

936
01:18:25,076 --> 01:18:27,536
Don't bust my balls.

937
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:31,540
We crossed a desert together,
we starved, froze, had accidents...

938
01:18:32,125 --> 01:18:34,460
My needs come before Chichina's bathing suit.

939
01:18:34,544 --> 01:18:36,045
I don't have them.

940
01:18:38,049 --> 01:18:40,173
I gave them to the mining couple.

941
01:18:48,891 --> 01:18:50,518
Woo her.

942
01:18:52,230 --> 01:18:54,395
Fuck you, Fuser.

943
01:18:58,986 --> 01:19:01,236
The house wins, gentlemen.

944
01:19:02,614 --> 01:19:03,907
Mr Lloyds is leaving our table.

945
01:19:03,991 --> 01:19:06,243
-Good evening.
-Good evening, sir.

946
01:19:06,369 --> 01:19:07,826
-Miss...
-Place your bets, gentlemen.

947
01:19:07,910 --> 01:19:09,954
-Eight soles.
-Ten soles.

948
01:19:10,663 --> 01:19:11,956
One sol.

949
01:19:14,292 --> 01:19:15,834
Sir, this is for men, not schoolchildren.

950
01:19:15,917 --> 01:19:19,088
I didn't know that in Peru a man's balls
are measured in soles.

951
01:19:20,966 --> 01:19:22,841
Very well. Let's play.

952
01:19:22,925 --> 01:19:24,175
Cards, sirs.

953
01:19:25,428 --> 01:19:26,428
Open.

954
01:19:26,764 --> 01:19:28,097
-Card?
-One.

955
01:19:28,557 --> 01:19:30,016
-Sir?
-No.

956
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:31,768
-Sir?
-One.

957
01:19:33,938 --> 01:19:35,437
I'll stay put.

958
01:19:35,605 --> 01:19:37,398
-Card.
-Sure.

959
01:19:39,151 --> 01:19:40,276
Thank you.

960
01:19:41,445 --> 01:19:44,989
Gentlemen, the house pays 2 1 .

961
01:19:45,447 --> 01:19:46,615
Sir, 1 7...

962
01:19:47,325 --> 01:19:48,951
I'm sorry, gentlemen.

963
01:19:49,452 --> 01:19:52,162
-Young man?
-Pay up. 2 1 .

964
01:19:55,126 --> 01:19:56,292
-How much did you bet?
-One sol.

965
01:19:57,209 --> 01:19:59,544
There we go, the first one.

966
01:20:02,049 --> 01:20:04,883
Well, gentlemen, let's continue. Place your bets.

967
01:20:04,967 --> 01:20:06,010
Two soles.

968
01:20:24,487 --> 01:20:27,281
Gentlemen, don't fall asleep on me,
let's see those bets.

969
01:20:27,616 --> 01:20:30,201
-Thirty soles.
-Ten soles.

970
01:20:32,454 --> 01:20:34,663
Gentlemen, once again! Blackjack!

971
01:20:35,124 --> 01:20:36,792
That's impossible!

972
01:20:37,044 --> 01:20:38,792
-How much do I owe you?
-Thirty soles.

973
01:20:38,919 --> 01:20:39,918
The house pays up.

974
01:20:40,127 --> 01:20:41,670
See you later. Thank you.

975
01:20:42,340 --> 01:20:43,464
I'll be retiring.

976
01:20:43,590 --> 01:20:47,344
I think we know who's got
the biggest balls at this table.

977
01:20:47,428 --> 01:20:48,844
Excuse me, gentlemen.

978
01:20:49,180 --> 01:20:50,596
Son-of-a-bitch!

979
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:53,557
Hey, now that we're millionaires, let's go eat.

980
01:20:53,642 --> 01:20:55,267
Precisely, check out that morsel right there.

981
01:20:55,435 --> 01:20:57,103
What a lucky night.

982
01:20:57,856 --> 01:21:00,689
Ernesto... This is Luz, which means "light."

983
01:21:00,774 --> 01:21:01,775
At your service.

984
01:21:01,859 --> 01:21:03,693
"Electrifying light that dazzles my dreams.

985
01:21:03,778 --> 01:21:05,946
Get ready, you've no clue what's coming to you."

986
01:21:06,030 --> 01:21:07,029
Neruda?

987
01:21:07,113 --> 01:21:08,154
Granado.

988
01:22:06,256 --> 01:22:07,298
Are you Doctor Bresciani?

989
01:22:07,425 --> 01:22:09,176
How are you, boys? Good trip?

990
01:22:09,343 --> 01:22:11,093
-Yes.
-Long, but good.

991
01:22:11,177 --> 01:22:12,178
A bit long, huh?

992
01:22:12,263 --> 01:22:15,474
-Alberto, Ernesto?
-No, the other way round.

993
01:22:16,308 --> 01:22:20,521
-A pleasure, I'm Bresciani.
-The pleasure is ours, Doctor.

994
01:22:20,605 --> 01:22:23,481
Dr Pesce has spoken enthusiastically
of you, so welcome to San Pablo.

995
01:22:23,607 --> 01:22:26,234
Oh, by the way, I have a letter from him.

996
01:22:26,318 --> 01:22:28,778
-Do you want it now?
-Later on.

997
01:22:30,407 --> 01:22:34,452
Well, since we're already here,
I can tell you about the colony.

998
01:22:34,536 --> 01:22:36,787
The Amazon cuts the colony in half.

999
01:22:37,122 --> 01:22:40,331
The patients live on the South side,

1000
01:22:40,624 --> 01:22:44,295
and the staff, doctors and nurses
are here on the North...

1001
01:22:44,546 --> 01:22:47,630
as well as a group of nuns
who do things with great efficiency.

1002
01:22:48,214 --> 01:22:49,924
Here's your room.

1003
01:22:53,344 --> 01:22:56,639
The beds are a bit hard,
but it's good for the spine.

1004
01:23:01,312 --> 01:23:07,191
You can see the hospital from here,
and the lab is over there.

1005
01:23:08,194 --> 01:23:13,448
Dr Souza Lima, these are
our Argentinian volunteers, Mr Granado,

1006
01:23:13,532 --> 01:23:14,992
Mr Ernesto Guevara.

1007
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:17,744
Alberto, I believe you have
experience in the laboratory, right?

1008
01:23:17,828 --> 01:23:18,871
That's correct.

1009
01:23:19,039 --> 01:23:22,916
I think he'll be able to help.
Why don't you show him the research lab?

1010
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:26,545
Ernesto, you're going to help me
at the hospital with consultations.

1011
01:23:29,007 --> 01:23:33,052
We transfer the seriously ill over here,
we bring them in from the South side.

1012
01:23:34,345 --> 01:23:35,846
Hello, Doctor.

1013
01:23:36,348 --> 01:23:41,726
-Do you also operate on this side?
-Yes, we have an OR over there.

1014
01:23:44,981 --> 01:23:48,608
That's Elvia, she's the daughter
of a patient. A very good nurse.

1015
01:23:53,030 --> 01:23:54,198
How is he?

1016
01:23:54,366 --> 01:23:55,406
-Is he okay?
-He's much better.

1017
01:23:56,825 --> 01:24:00,203
-Continue the same treatment then.
-Okay.

1018
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:05,583
Doctor, how many patients
live on the South side?

1019
01:24:05,753 --> 01:24:07,879
-Almost 600.
-All Peruvian?

1020
01:24:08,047 --> 01:24:10,879
No, most are, but we have some from Colombia,

1021
01:24:11,007 --> 01:24:13,843
Venezuela, and other South American countries.

1022
01:24:19,515 --> 01:24:22,310
I suggest you wear these gloves.

1023
01:24:22,894 --> 01:24:25,646
Although leprosy is not contagious
under treatment,

1024
01:24:25,730 --> 01:24:28,567
the nuns are quite insistent on this point.

1025
01:24:32,654 --> 01:24:35,281
If it's not contagious,
then it's just symbolic, right?

1026
01:24:35,489 --> 01:24:38,825
Yes, I'm just telling you
so you don't make any mortal enemies.

1027
01:24:38,950 --> 01:24:42,413
You know what, Doctor, you'll excuse us,
but we're not going to wear them.

1028
01:24:42,582 --> 01:24:43,747
Thank you, Doctor.

1029
01:24:45,499 --> 01:24:47,919
-Don't say I didn't warn you.
-All right.

1030
01:24:54,425 --> 01:24:55,801
Get the boxes out.

1031
01:24:55,886 --> 01:24:57,262
Right this way, boys.

1032
01:25:04,020 --> 01:25:07,563
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.

1033
01:25:07,772 --> 01:25:11,109
-Welcome to San Pablo.
-Thank you.

1034
01:25:11,235 --> 01:25:13,109
Papá Carlito at your service.

1035
01:25:13,277 --> 01:25:15,446
-Nemesio Reyna.
-I'm Ernesto Guevara.

1036
01:25:15,529 --> 01:25:17,281
I'm Alberto Granado, a pleasure to meet you.

1037
01:25:21,828 --> 01:25:24,832
Doctor, haven't you explained the rules?

1038
01:25:30,129 --> 01:25:31,295
A pleasure.

1039
01:25:32,298 --> 01:25:35,342
-How are you, Nemesio?
-Well.

1040
01:25:36,969 --> 01:25:40,679
Papá Carlito is the community leader.
They are Argentinian doctors.

1041
01:25:41,472 --> 01:25:44,142
A pleasure. See you later.

1042
01:25:45,227 --> 01:25:47,062
Those guys are real gents.

1043
01:25:47,146 --> 01:25:50,814
Doctor, these gentlemen just show up
and think they can do what they want?

1044
01:25:51,901 --> 01:25:52,902
Mother Sor Alberto,

1045
01:25:52,986 --> 01:25:55,985
these gentlemen have medical experience
in Córdoba and Buenos Aires.

1046
01:25:56,322 --> 01:25:59,573
That doesn't give them the right
to break the rules.

1047
01:25:59,658 --> 01:26:02,201
Why don't we talk about this later?

1048
01:26:02,494 --> 01:26:04,119
Thank you, Mother, you are very understanding.

1049
01:26:04,204 --> 01:26:05,747
Excuse us.

1050
01:26:06,164 --> 01:26:07,707
She's the Mother Superior.

1051
01:26:08,667 --> 01:26:11,502
-I think she wants me.
-I think she does.

1052
01:26:15,174 --> 01:26:16,173
Hello.

1053
01:26:19,512 --> 01:26:21,097
This is the dining hall.

1054
01:26:21,181 --> 01:26:23,722
The nuns provide lunch here on Sundays.

1055
01:26:24,265 --> 01:26:26,726
But only for those who come to Mass.

1056
01:26:29,105 --> 01:26:33,316
Most of the patients were sent
here by their families

1057
01:26:33,401 --> 01:26:35,319
or fired from their jobs.

1058
01:26:35,612 --> 01:26:38,697
So they adapt the their new lives,
by building their own houses...

1059
01:26:38,823 --> 01:26:40,907
farming and raising animals.

1060
01:26:41,533 --> 01:26:42,535
-Doctor.
-Good day.

1061
01:26:42,661 --> 01:26:45,704
-How's Silvia?
-She doesn't want the surgery.

1062
01:26:46,371 --> 01:26:48,081
Thank you.

1063
01:26:49,543 --> 01:26:52,375
Silvia is a somewhat rebellious patient.

1064
01:26:52,461 --> 01:26:55,547
Surgery is the last chance to save her arm.

1065
01:26:58,675 --> 01:27:00,051
Hello, Silvia.

1066
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:04,723
She's young.

1067
01:27:08,562 --> 01:27:10,313
May I go talk to her?

1068
01:27:31,168 --> 01:27:33,168
Can I sit?

1069
01:27:40,759 --> 01:27:42,344
Does your arm hurt?

1070
01:27:54,939 --> 01:27:56,608
What's wrong?

1071
01:27:57,903 --> 01:28:00,112
I was born with shitty lungs.

1072
01:28:03,115 --> 01:28:04,450
Pity.

1073
01:28:05,326 --> 01:28:06,702
It's not so bad.

1074
01:28:08,454 --> 01:28:10,872
Thanks to that, I got out of military service.

1075
01:28:12,125 --> 01:28:14,793
I didn't have to clean anybody's boots.

1076
01:28:16,336 --> 01:28:18,420
Is that why you became a doctor,

1077
01:28:20,132 --> 01:28:22,092
because you're sick?

1078
01:28:23,134 --> 01:28:24,386
Maybe...

1079
01:28:26,348 --> 01:28:29,224
The first word I learned was injection.

1080
01:28:32,813 --> 01:28:35,022
I want to be useful, somehow.

1081
01:28:38,151 --> 01:28:40,236
You're wasting your time.

1082
01:28:40,861 --> 01:28:41,987
Why?

1083
01:28:46,785 --> 01:28:48,243
Life is pain.

1084
01:28:50,246 --> 01:28:52,248
Yeah, it's pretty screwed up.

1085
01:28:54,167 --> 01:29:00,130
You gotta fight for every breath,
and tell death to go to hell.

1086
01:29:46,470 --> 01:29:47,677
Fuser...

1087
01:29:48,555 --> 01:29:51,516
Bresciani's going to write me a letter
of recommendation for a residency

1088
01:29:51,601 --> 01:29:53,850
in Caracas at the Cabo Blanco Hospital.

1089
01:29:54,810 --> 01:29:56,144
How's that sound?

1090
01:29:58,356 --> 01:30:00,191
That's good, isn't it?

1091
01:30:00,567 --> 01:30:01,608
Good?

1092
01:30:03,777 --> 01:30:05,404
What's wrong, Fuser?

1093
01:30:08,908 --> 01:30:10,533
Have you seen the river?

1094
01:30:11,204 --> 01:30:12,577
Of course.

1095
01:30:15,206 --> 01:30:17,457
It segregates the ill from the healthy.

1096
01:30:22,004 --> 01:30:23,004
Yes.

1097
01:30:55,289 --> 01:30:57,539
Look at this hand.

1098
01:30:57,623 --> 01:30:59,250
Right here.

1099
01:31:16,103 --> 01:31:17,810
Wipe.

1100
01:31:21,649 --> 01:31:22,817
Are you all right?

1101
01:31:24,568 --> 01:31:25,609
Scalpel.

1102
01:31:26,987 --> 01:31:28,738
It's all right.

1103
01:31:28,990 --> 01:31:31,324
Look at me, look me in the eye.

1104
01:31:31,616 --> 01:31:32,824
Are you all right?

1105
01:31:37,165 --> 01:31:41,292
The nerve is coming out, it's thick.

1106
01:31:44,839 --> 01:31:46,505
I have four siblings,

1107
01:31:48,009 --> 01:31:51,845
Celia, Ana María, Roberto and Juan Martín.

1108
01:31:53,680 --> 01:31:57,808
Honestly, they're what I miss most.

1109
01:31:58,353 --> 01:32:00,102
And also my Mum.

1110
01:32:12,200 --> 01:32:14,366
You have to let me know sooner.

1111
01:32:20,708 --> 01:32:22,584
Have you been playing football lately?

1112
01:32:23,377 --> 01:32:24,961
Not lately.

1113
01:32:25,046 --> 01:32:28,172
I'd appreciate it if you wore sneakers next time,

1114
01:32:29,592 --> 01:32:32,552
-and don't forget to invite me.
-My pleasure.

1115
01:33:47,670 --> 01:33:49,338
All right, Northerners!

1116
01:34:00,724 --> 01:34:05,771
Come on, Northerners, mark that one there!

1117
01:34:06,355 --> 01:34:07,982
Come on, Southerners!

1118
01:34:10,318 --> 01:34:12,611
All right, Southerners!

1119
01:34:12,738 --> 01:34:14,112
Get out there!

1120
01:34:18,159 --> 01:34:20,577
Mark that one!

1121
01:34:24,207 --> 01:34:25,331
Goal!

1122
01:34:32,006 --> 01:34:33,174
What happened?

1123
01:34:33,592 --> 01:34:36,427
What happened, Chubby? We nailed you!

1124
01:34:38,054 --> 01:34:39,681
Fuck you!

1125
01:34:44,729 --> 01:34:47,480
Some rice...corn, onion.

1126
01:34:48,064 --> 01:34:49,272
Excuse me.

1127
01:34:50,192 --> 01:34:52,818
Sister, why won't you serve us, what's wrong?

1128
01:34:53,821 --> 01:34:56,446
Mother Sor Alberto's rules are very clear.

1129
01:34:56,530 --> 01:34:59,200
food is served only to those
who attend Holy Mass.

1130
01:35:00,035 --> 01:35:02,244
They won't serve us
because we didn't go to Mass?

1131
01:35:02,412 --> 01:35:04,872
-Says who?
-Sor Alberto.

1132
01:35:06,374 --> 01:35:07,373
Mother...

1133
01:35:07,710 --> 01:35:08,751
Yes, sons?

1134
01:35:08,877 --> 01:35:11,962
-We'd like to eat, if possible.
-We deserve to eat like everybody else.

1135
01:35:12,046 --> 01:35:14,006
-But you didn't go to Mass.
-No.

1136
01:35:14,340 --> 01:35:19,552
So, how do you expect to feed the body
if you haven't first fed the soul?

1137
01:35:19,720 --> 01:35:22,890
Ma'am, it's unchristian to deny us food!

1138
01:35:23,099 --> 01:35:26,895
We have rules in this house,
and they have to be followed.

1139
01:35:27,562 --> 01:35:29,189
I didn't see any rulebook.

1140
01:35:29,315 --> 01:35:32,274
Neither did I. I think if I find it, I'll eat it.

1141
01:35:40,075 --> 01:35:41,117
Your lunch.

1142
01:35:42,745 --> 01:35:46,413
-You stole it?
-Yes.

1143
01:35:46,873 --> 01:35:47,999
Thank you.

1144
01:35:52,878 --> 01:35:55,673
-You stole it from Sor Alberto?
-Yes.

1145
01:35:55,882 --> 01:35:57,425
Thanks.

1146
01:36:13,233 --> 01:36:15,526
-Deep?
-Yeah.

1147
01:36:29,457 --> 01:36:32,086
-Do you want maté?
-No, thanks.

1148
01:36:46,226 --> 01:36:47,267
What?

1149
01:36:50,478 --> 01:36:53,190
-From Caracas?
-Caracas.

1150
01:37:01,990 --> 01:37:03,281
This is great.

1151
01:37:04,659 --> 01:37:05,785
Great, isn't it?

1152
01:37:07,705 --> 01:37:09,246
Should I take it?

1153
01:37:09,623 --> 01:37:11,790
What do you wanna do?

1154
01:37:16,296 --> 01:37:18,756
Maybe it's time to settle down, huh?

1155
01:37:20,051 --> 01:37:23,177
Get a steady job, a girlfriend.

1156
01:37:24,261 --> 01:37:25,638
Grow a gut.

1157
01:37:27,891 --> 01:37:32,145
And you? Are you going back to school,
to Buenos Aires?

1158
01:37:32,270 --> 01:37:35,691
I don't know. If I find a way of getting back, yes.

1159
01:37:37,776 --> 01:37:40,737
You'll be 24 next week, Fuser.

1160
01:37:42,699 --> 01:37:44,823
I should be thinking ahead, huh?

1161
01:38:10,058 --> 01:38:13,102
He dances pretty well. Have you seen the nun?

1162
01:38:16,565 --> 01:38:18,109
Check this out.

1163
01:38:31,915 --> 01:38:33,747
Come on, dance.

1164
01:38:45,136 --> 01:38:46,220
Bravo!

1165
01:38:47,471 --> 01:38:49,931
Thank you. Very nice.

1166
01:38:56,397 --> 01:38:58,481
-Good party, huh?
-Fantastic!

1167
01:38:58,607 --> 01:39:02,026
Listen, it's the Tango you danced in Miramar.

1168
01:39:02,402 --> 01:39:03,361
I like it.

1169
01:39:03,446 --> 01:39:04,697
Did you notice? You know how to dance this one.

1170
01:39:04,823 --> 01:39:07,949
-This one's a bit fast, isn't it?
-You dance it perfectly,

1171
01:39:08,284 --> 01:39:11,787
and I think there's a young lady
interested in dancing with you.

1172
01:39:12,788 --> 01:39:13,873
I should ask her, right?

1173
01:39:13,999 --> 01:39:17,417
The bird of youth flies away and
doesn't come back. Fly, man, fly!

1174
01:39:17,918 --> 01:39:19,295
Would you like to dance?

1175
01:39:20,548 --> 01:39:22,505
-Do you know this dance?
-Yes.

1176
01:39:26,886 --> 01:39:28,971
This version is a bit faster than the one I know.

1177
01:39:34,437 --> 01:39:35,436
Mambo.

1178
01:39:38,981 --> 01:39:40,566
Let Ernesto dance!

1179
01:39:41,819 --> 01:39:43,401
Did you think it was a Tango?

1180
01:39:43,486 --> 01:39:45,321
It's a Mambo, Fuser!

1181
01:40:03,007 --> 01:40:04,340
Make three wishes!

1182
01:40:05,174 --> 01:40:06,509
All right!

1183
01:40:13,141 --> 01:40:16,267
My dear friends, a moment, please.

1184
01:40:16,352 --> 01:40:21,439
I think it's the perfect time
to let Ernesto and Alberto know...

1185
01:40:21,524 --> 01:40:25,652
how grateful we are to them.
Not only for having come here,

1186
01:40:26,112 --> 01:40:29,406
but also for the enthusiasm and dedication...

1187
01:40:29,491 --> 01:40:34,453
they have shown towards San Pablo's
patients during their three weeks with us.

1188
01:40:35,371 --> 01:40:39,667
To show our appreciation,
we have a little surprise for you.

1189
01:40:39,750 --> 01:40:43,879
Tomorrow we're going to give you a raft
so that you can continue your trip.

1190
01:40:44,047 --> 01:40:48,090
This raft will be named after tonight's
newly invented dance:

1191
01:40:48,176 --> 01:40:49,886
the Mambo-Tango.

1192
01:40:50,804 --> 01:40:53,972
-Nice one!
-Thank you, Doctor!

1193
01:40:57,353 --> 01:41:02,146
Speech! Speech!

1194
01:41:06,487 --> 01:41:11,032
Well...it's my duty to thank you for this toast

1195
01:41:11,117 --> 01:41:13,326
with something more than the usual conventions.

1196
01:41:14,119 --> 01:41:17,495
But, in view of the shabby conditions
in which we travel,

1197
01:41:17,580 --> 01:41:20,125
all we have to offer you are words.

1198
01:41:21,126 --> 01:41:24,669
Employing them, I'd like
to express my sincere thanks,

1199
01:41:24,753 --> 01:41:31,593
to the entire staff of the colony,
who, although they barely know us,

1200
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:34,222
have shown their affection
by celebrating my birthday

1201
01:41:34,348 --> 01:41:36,598
as if it were an intimate celebration
of one of their own.

1202
01:41:37,767 --> 01:41:41,104
Tomorrow we leave for Peru,

1203
01:41:42,647 --> 01:41:45,899
so these words are also our farewell,

1204
01:41:47,152 --> 01:41:52,781
in which I'd like to say how grateful
I am to the people of this country

1205
01:41:54,451 --> 01:41:58,286
who have generously looked after us
again and again.

1206
01:42:00,875 --> 01:42:04,168
I'd like to add something else,
completely unrelated to this toast...

1207
01:42:04,919 --> 01:42:07,003
Don't worry, I won't dance.

1208
01:42:12,595 --> 01:42:19,390
Even though we are too insignificant
to be spokesmen for such a noble cause,

1209
01:42:21,312 --> 01:42:22,686
we believe,

1210
01:42:22,981 --> 01:42:25,897
and this journey has only confirmed this belief,

1211
01:42:27,192 --> 01:42:30,154
that the division of America into unstable

1212
01:42:30,489 --> 01:42:33,404
and illusory nations, is a complete fiction.

1213
01:42:35,158 --> 01:42:40,872
We are one single mestizo race
from Mexico to the Magellan Straits.

1214
01:42:42,123 --> 01:42:45,794
And so, in an attempt to free ourselves
from narrow-minded provincialism,

1215
01:42:47,127 --> 01:42:48,921
I propose a toast to Peru

1216
01:42:50,216 --> 01:42:52,425
and to a United America.

1217
01:42:58,809 --> 01:43:01,141
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

1218
01:43:01,392 --> 01:43:02,851
Cheers!

1219
01:43:10,987 --> 01:43:12,321
Bravo!

1220
01:44:00,578 --> 01:44:02,495
What... What's wrong?

1221
01:44:04,748 --> 01:44:07,001
Do you know where the boat is?

1222
01:44:08,085 --> 01:44:09,836
No, can't see it.

1223
01:44:14,550 --> 01:44:17,594
I'm going to celebrate my birthday
on the other side.

1224
01:44:18,762 --> 01:44:22,098
Sure, tomorrow, when we find the boat
you'll go across and celebrate.

1225
01:44:22,352 --> 01:44:23,351
-No. Now.
-No, not now.

1226
01:44:23,435 --> 01:44:24,434
My birthday is today, not tomorrow.

1227
01:44:24,602 --> 01:44:26,020
Yeah, I know, Fuser, but you're not going to...

1228
01:44:26,103 --> 01:44:29,441
Are you nuts? At night? The animals
in there will eat you alive!

1229
01:44:29,649 --> 01:44:32,399
How many times did we
think we wouldn't make it...?

1230
01:44:32,692 --> 01:44:34,443
-And look, here we are.
-But this is different, Fuser.

1231
01:44:34,654 --> 01:44:36,615
-Why?
-Because I won't be there to help you.

1232
01:44:36,698 --> 01:44:39,865
-I'm not going in there...
-You're always gonna be with me, Mial.

1233
01:44:39,951 --> 01:44:42,453
Come here you little shit! Come here!

1234
01:44:42,537 --> 01:44:44,497
Your mother's gonna kill me!

1235
01:44:44,915 --> 01:44:46,205
Fuser! Come here!

1236
01:44:46,456 --> 01:44:49,251
Ernesto, listen to me!

1237
01:44:50,837 --> 01:44:52,462
Ernesto, come back!

1238
01:44:53,254 --> 01:44:54,672
Fuck you!

1239
01:44:55,299 --> 01:44:56,384
Ernesto, come back!

1240
01:45:00,595 --> 01:45:02,222
Fuck, come back!

1241
01:45:02,306 --> 01:45:03,432
What's wrong?

1242
01:45:03,517 --> 01:45:05,518
The crazy idiot wants to swim across the river!

1243
01:45:05,602 --> 01:45:06,393
What?

1244
01:45:06,477 --> 01:45:08,229
Please tell me someone has
already crossed this river.

1245
01:45:08,313 --> 01:45:09,980
In all the years I've been here, no one.

1246
01:45:10,065 --> 01:45:11,900
Ernesto, come back here, damn it.

1247
01:45:12,150 --> 01:45:14,733
Son, listen to your friend!

1248
01:45:14,859 --> 01:45:15,860
He won't listen.

1249
01:45:15,945 --> 01:45:17,987
-Come here, kid!
-Come back, Ernesto!

1250
01:45:18,991 --> 01:45:21,740
Come back! It's dangerous!

1251
01:45:25,371 --> 01:45:26,539
Ernesto!

1252
01:45:29,834 --> 01:45:36,674
-Ernesto, come back!
-Come on, come back!

1253
01:45:37,633 --> 01:45:40,469
The river is very strong!

1254
01:45:44,765 --> 01:45:45,766
What is it?

1255
01:45:45,851 --> 01:45:47,518
I don't know, something's going on.

1256
01:45:52,232 --> 01:45:55,942
Ernesto! Do what I say for once in your life.

1257
01:45:56,026 --> 01:45:57,778
The current is even stronger now.

1258
01:45:57,904 --> 01:45:58,947
What is he doing?

1259
01:45:59,031 --> 01:46:01,283
This idiot wants to swim across the river!

1260
01:46:01,367 --> 01:46:02,700
Come back, damn it!

1261
01:46:03,242 --> 01:46:04,368
Ernesto!

1262
01:46:09,207 --> 01:46:10,415
He's swimming...

1263
01:46:11,960 --> 01:46:16,088
-Is that Ernesto?
-Yes, he's swimming towards us...

1264
01:46:16,173 --> 01:46:17,464
He's over there!

1265
01:46:20,927 --> 01:46:22,512
Boy, get back here!

1266
01:46:24,889 --> 01:46:27,058
-He's tired.
-You can do it, Ernesto!

1267
01:46:34,858 --> 01:46:36,026
He's over there!

1268
01:46:43,743 --> 01:46:45,742
Go! Go! Go, Ernesto!

1269
01:46:50,583 --> 01:46:53,709
Come on!

1270
01:47:14,607 --> 01:47:15,813
Just a bit more!

1271
01:47:38,338 --> 01:47:42,340
He made it! The motherfucker made it!

1272
01:47:42,843 --> 01:47:44,678
He made it!

1273
01:47:52,686 --> 01:47:55,271
All right, Ernesto!

1274
01:48:04,322 --> 01:48:05,865
I always knew he'd make it.

1275
01:48:06,908 --> 01:48:08,285
I always knew...

1276
01:48:09,411 --> 01:48:10,662
Son-of-a-bitch.

1277
01:48:44,362 --> 01:48:46,072
I'm going to miss you so much.

1278
01:48:46,198 --> 01:48:47,617
Take good care.

1279
01:48:48,451 --> 01:48:51,410
See you, Nemesio.

1280
01:48:53,539 --> 01:48:56,751
Papá Carlito is feeling real sad...

1281
01:48:56,835 --> 01:48:57,834
Take care of yourself.

1282
01:48:58,252 --> 01:48:59,335
Bye, Bin.

1283
01:49:00,171 --> 01:49:02,839
-We're gonna miss you.
-Me too.

1284
01:49:03,383 --> 01:49:06,760
Thanks for everything.

1285
01:49:07,886 --> 01:49:09,220
Don't forget us.

1286
01:49:09,388 --> 01:49:11,681
-Take good care of yourself.
-You too, Silvia.

1287
01:49:14,060 --> 01:49:15,392
Thank you, thanks.

1288
01:49:17,731 --> 01:49:18,730
Bye, Ernesto.

1289
01:49:18,898 --> 01:49:20,022
Take care.

1290
01:49:21,067 --> 01:49:23,360
Take good care of your family.

1291
01:49:31,202 --> 01:49:33,203
Take care of yourselves, you guys.

1292
01:49:37,042 --> 01:49:41,585
-Goodbye, Mauro.
-Safe travels.

1293
01:51:54,512 --> 01:51:58,015
I'd prepared a speech full of
anecdotes and grandiose phrases,

1294
01:51:58,099 --> 01:52:00,142
I can't remember shit now.

1295
01:52:00,310 --> 01:52:01,559
That's how it goes.

1296
01:52:02,186 --> 01:52:03,187
Che...

1297
01:52:03,521 --> 01:52:04,523
What?

1298
01:52:06,943 --> 01:52:09,860
It's not too late to come work
with me in Cabo Blanco.

1299
01:52:11,572 --> 01:52:13,907
You could come back after you graduate.
I'll wait for you.

1300
01:52:14,658 --> 01:52:15,657
I don't know.

1301
01:52:18,371 --> 01:52:19,620
I just don't know.

1302
01:52:22,373 --> 01:52:25,083
You know, Mial, all this time
we spent on the road,

1303
01:52:28,005 --> 01:52:29,754
something happened.

1304
01:52:32,426 --> 01:52:35,220
Something I'll have to think about
for a long time.

1305
01:52:45,730 --> 01:52:47,065
So much injustice...

1306
01:52:52,612 --> 01:52:54,738
Come on, the plane's taking off!

1307
01:52:54,865 --> 01:52:55,949
Well, I should go...

1308
01:52:56,242 --> 01:52:58,577
Wait, take this, it may help.

1309
01:53:01,205 --> 01:53:03,664
-You kept it?
-It's yours.

1310
01:53:05,291 --> 01:53:06,876
-I'd better go.
-Yes.

1311
01:53:18,054 --> 01:53:19,429
I'll write, okay?

1312
01:53:29,566 --> 01:53:30,610
Fuser!

1313
01:53:37,326 --> 01:53:39,783
I have something very important to tell you...

1314
01:53:41,120 --> 01:53:43,996
My birthday is not on April 2nd,
it's on August 8th.

1315
01:53:44,166 --> 01:53:46,040
-I just said that to motivate us.
-I know.

1316
01:53:46,124 --> 01:53:47,082
-You knew it?
-Yeah.

1317
01:53:47,167 --> 01:53:48,168
Son-of-a-bitch!

1318
01:54:03,141 --> 01:54:05,770
-So long, Mial!
-Bye, my friend.

1319
01:54:40,389 --> 01:54:43,347
This isn't a tale of heroic feats.

1320
01:54:44,392 --> 01:54:49,646
It's about two lives running parallel for a while,

1321
01:54:49,854 --> 01:54:53,067
with common aspirations and similar dreams.

1322
01:54:54,444 --> 01:54:59,907
Was our view too narrow, too biased, too hasty?

1323
01:55:00,574 --> 01:55:03,326
Were our conclusions too rigid?

1324
01:55:04,411 --> 01:55:05,578
Maybe.

1325
01:55:07,540 --> 01:55:10,667
Wandering around our America

1326
01:55:10,751 --> 01:55:12,877
has changed me more than I thought.

1327
01:55:14,089 --> 01:55:16,881
I am not me any more.

1328
01:55:17,550 --> 01:55:20,260
at least I'm not the same me I was.

1329
01:56:54,815 --> 01:56:59,860
It took eight years for Ernesto
and Alberto to meet again.

1330
01:57:01,239 --> 01:57:05,241
In 1 960 Granado was invited
to live and work in Cuba.

1331
01:57:05,407 --> 01:57:09,495
The invitation came from his old friend Fuser,
now "Comandante" Ernesto Che Guevara,

1332
01:57:09,704 --> 01:57:13,416
one of the most prominent and inspiring
leaders of the Cuban Revolution.

1333
01:57:14,543 --> 01:57:18,921
Che went on to fight for his ideals in
the Congo and Bolivia where he was captured,

1334
01:57:19,005 --> 01:57:22,967
and with the support of the CIA,
murdered in October, 1 967.

1335
01:57:23,969 --> 01:57:26,220
Forever faithful to his friend Fuser,

1336
01:57:26,346 --> 01:57:30,474
Granado remained in Cuba where
he founded the Santiago School of Medicine.

1337
01:57:30,600 --> 01:57:34,688
He lives in Havana with his wife Delia,
their children and grandchildren.
