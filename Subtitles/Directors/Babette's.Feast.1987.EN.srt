00:01:30,313 --> 00:01:35,114
- In this remote spot
there once lived two sisters... -

4
00:01:35,185 --> 00:01:38,712
- who were both past
the first flush of youth. -

5
00:01:38,788 --> 00:01:41,689
- They had been christened
Martina and Philippa... -

6
00:01:41,758 --> 00:01:45,922
- after Martin Luther
and his friend Philipp Melanchton. -

7
00:01:48,565 --> 00:01:50,624
- They spent all their time... -

8
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,137
- and almost all their small income
on good works. -

9
00:02:08,551 --> 00:02:10,041
Thank you.

10
00:02:14,658 --> 00:02:16,148
Thank you.

11
00:02:24,567 --> 00:02:27,968
- Their father had been
a priest and a prophet... -

12
00:02:28,038 --> 00:02:30,404
- the founder of a religious sect... -

13
00:02:30,473 --> 00:02:34,967
- who was well-respected,
and perhaps also a little feared. -

14
00:02:37,047 --> 00:02:42,952
- The minister had married late
and by now had long been dead. -

15
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:46,284
- Every year his disciples
became fewer in number. -

16
00:02:46,356 --> 00:02:51,020
- But they continued meeting
to read and interpret the Word... -

17
00:02:51,094 --> 00:02:54,188
- and to honor
the spirit of their master... -

18
00:02:54,264 --> 00:02:57,358
- whose presence they felt
was among them. -

19
00:02:57,434 --> 00:03:03,532
Jerusalem
my heart's true home

20
00:03:03,606 --> 00:03:08,771
Your name
is forever dear to me

21
00:03:10,146 --> 00:03:16,710
Your kindness
is second to none

22
00:03:16,786 --> 00:03:22,122
You keep us clothed and fed

23
00:03:22,192 --> 00:03:26,629
Never would you give a stone

24
00:03:28,298 --> 00:03:33,668
To the child
who begs for bread

25
00:03:41,211 --> 00:03:44,908
- The two sisters
had a French servant. -

26
00:03:44,981 --> 00:03:47,609
- Her name was Babette. -

27
00:03:47,684 --> 00:03:51,950
- This may seem strange
for two puritan ladies... -

28
00:03:52,021 --> 00:03:55,115
- living in such a remote,
desolate place... -

29
00:03:55,191 --> 00:03:57,250
- and it deserves an explanation. -

30
00:03:58,261 --> 00:04:01,753
- Babettes presence in the house
of the two sisters... -

31
00:04:01,831 --> 00:04:06,928
- can only be explained through
the hidden regions of the heart. -

32
00:04:08,071 --> 00:04:11,438
- As young girls, the beauty
of Martina and Philippa... -

33
00:04:11,508 --> 00:04:15,501
- had been extraordinary,
akin to flowering fruit trees. -

34
00:04:23,553 --> 00:04:27,489
- They were never to be seen
at balls or parties. -

35
00:04:27,557 --> 00:04:32,153
- The young men went to church
in the hope of seeing them. -

36
00:05:04,461 --> 00:05:09,091
Oh, Lord, allow thy kingdom

37
00:05:09,165 --> 00:05:12,396
To descend upon us here

38
00:05:12,469 --> 00:05:16,667
So that the spirit of mercy

39
00:05:16,739 --> 00:05:20,869
May wipe out all trace of sin

40
00:05:20,944 --> 00:05:24,846
Then we shall know
in our hearts

41
00:05:24,914 --> 00:05:29,044
That God lives here with us

42
00:05:29,118 --> 00:05:34,112
And that Thou art dwelling

43
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:38,957
With those that trust in Thee

44
00:05:46,536 --> 00:05:51,337
- In the minister's flock,
earthly love and marriage... -

45
00:05:51,407 --> 00:05:55,571
- were considered to be of scant worth
and merely empty illusion. -

46
00:05:55,645 --> 00:05:57,442
In this calling of mine... 

47
00:05:57,514 --> 00:06:02,508
my two daughters
are my right hand and my left.

48
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,454
Would you rob me of them?

49
00:06:05,522 --> 00:06:09,720
- Never the less,
these two beauties... -

50
00:06:09,792 --> 00:06:14,229
- had upset the peace of heart
and the destinies... -

51
00:06:14,297 --> 00:06:17,528
- of two young gentlemen
from the great world outside. -

52
00:06:32,582 --> 00:06:37,679
- One was a young officer
by the name of Lorens Lowenhielm. -

53
00:06:37,754 --> 00:06:41,349
- He had led a merry life
in his garrison town... -

54
00:06:41,424 --> 00:06:43,415
- and had fallen into debt. -

55
00:06:46,996 --> 00:06:48,987
Attention!

56
00:06:52,368 --> 00:06:55,360
Captain, sir!
Twenty men accounted for!

57
00:07:17,527 --> 00:07:21,019
Lorens!
Get a grip on yourself.

58
00:07:40,717 --> 00:07:44,448
You will spend three months
at your aunt's house.

59
00:07:45,188 --> 00:07:47,748
- The old lady?
- Yes.

60
00:07:49,158 --> 00:07:50,648
At Norre Vossborg?

61
00:07:52,495 --> 00:07:54,053
Injutland?

62
00:07:55,732 --> 00:07:59,168
At Norre Vossborg Manor
you'll have time to think...

63
00:07:59,235 --> 00:08:01,669
about your conduct...

64
00:08:01,738 --> 00:08:04,229
and to set about
improving it.

65
00:08:49,118 --> 00:08:51,143
Welcome to Norre Vossborg.

66
00:08:58,061 --> 00:09:01,622
Come along.
I will show you your room.

67
00:10:25,882 --> 00:10:29,784
- At this very moment
he had a mighty vision... -

68
00:10:29,852 --> 00:10:31,820
- of a higher and purer life... -

69
00:10:31,888 --> 00:10:35,722
- without creditor's letters
or parental lectures... -

70
00:10:35,792 --> 00:10:38,852
- and with a gentle angel
at his side. -

71
00:10:42,231 --> 00:10:45,166
- With the help of his pious aunt... -

72
00:10:45,234 --> 00:10:48,670
- he gained admission
to the minister's house. -

73
00:11:04,654 --> 00:11:08,146
Don't just stand there, Martha!
Fetch a cloth!

74
00:11:39,222 --> 00:11:43,215
Mercy and truth are met together...

75
00:11:43,292 --> 00:11:45,760
my dear brothers and sisters.

76
00:11:45,828 --> 00:11:50,765
Righteousness and peace
shall kiss one another.

77
00:11:52,468 --> 00:11:56,131
- He repeated his visits,
but it seemed to him... -

78
00:11:56,205 --> 00:11:59,766
- that each time he grew
more insignificant. -

79
00:12:02,912 --> 00:12:04,174
Excuse me.

80
00:12:13,222 --> 00:12:17,556
God's paths
run beyond the seas...

81
00:12:17,627 --> 00:12:20,528
and the snowy mountain peaks...

82
00:12:20,596 --> 00:12:23,861
where the human eye
sees no tracks.

83
00:12:24,867 --> 00:12:26,596
Amen.

84
00:13:06,709 --> 00:13:08,700
I am going away forever...

85
00:13:09,745 --> 00:13:12,737
and I shall never,
never see you again.

86
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:19,219
For I have learned here
that life is hard and cruel...

87
00:13:21,324 --> 00:13:24,657
and that in this world
there are things that are...

88
00:13:25,661 --> 00:13:26,855
impossible.

89
00:13:52,788 --> 00:13:57,282
- Where the other young officers
spoke of their loves... -

90
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,454
- he was silent about his. -

91
00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:03,157
- For, reliving it now,
in the officers' mess... -

92
00:14:03,232 --> 00:14:06,759
- and seeing it
through others' eyes... -

93
00:14:06,836 --> 00:14:09,828
- it appeared to him
a pitiful affair. -

94
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:13,865
Lorens.

95
00:14:15,745 --> 00:14:18,578
How can a lieutenant
of the Hussars...

96
00:14:18,647 --> 00:14:21,946
allow himself to be
defeated and frustrated--

97
00:14:22,018 --> 00:14:23,952
By some pious "melancholics"...

98
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:27,012
who can't even afford
the salt for their soup?

99
00:14:28,224 --> 00:14:31,625
I cannot forget the picture
of that lovely maiden.

100
00:14:31,694 --> 00:14:34,185
You are a dreamer, Lorens.

101
00:14:35,398 --> 00:14:38,390
I would prefer to be like you.

102
00:14:39,035 --> 00:14:42,994
I will forget what happened
on the jutland coast.

103
00:14:43,072 --> 00:14:46,235
From now I shall look forward,
not backward.

104
00:14:46,308 --> 00:14:50,802
I will think of nothing
but my career, and some day...

105
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,338
I will cut a brilliant figure
in the world of prestige.

106
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,698
- He married a lady-in-waiting
to Queen Sophia. -

107
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:25,514
- At that time piety
was fashionable at the court. -

108
00:15:25,581 --> 00:15:29,347
- He knew how to apply words
and phrases from the parsonage... -

109
00:15:29,418 --> 00:15:31,818
- that were engraved in his memory. -

110
00:15:31,887 --> 00:15:35,084
We implore God's mercy.

111
00:15:39,195 --> 00:15:42,824
We must carry out
the Lord's tasks with love.

112
00:15:58,681 --> 00:16:01,741
Do you remember
that silent young man...

113
00:16:01,817 --> 00:16:04,809
who appeared so suddenly,
and vanished just as suddenly?

114
00:16:11,894 --> 00:16:14,124
Yes.

115
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:28,970
- A year later, an even more
distinguished person arrived. -

116
00:16:29,044 --> 00:16:31,274
- The famous singer from Paris,
Achille Papin... -

117
00:16:31,347 --> 00:16:35,340
- who had been performing
at the Royal Opera in Stockholm. -

118
00:16:56,138 --> 00:17:00,131
Thank you, dear lady.
You are so kind, dear lady.

119
00:17:01,911 --> 00:17:04,243
Stockholm is
a very beautiful town.

120
00:17:05,948 --> 00:17:09,213
Scandinavia has
a wealth of beautiful cities.

121
00:17:11,921 --> 00:17:13,548
I travel much...

122
00:17:13,622 --> 00:17:17,080
but what I yearn for most
is to be alone.

123
00:17:17,893 --> 00:17:19,884
I love silence.

124
00:17:21,564 --> 00:17:24,397
Silence,
and the sound of waves.

125
00:17:24,466 --> 00:17:29,233
Then you should visit
the coast of jutland.

126
00:17:29,305 --> 00:17:31,170
It is magnificent...

127
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,731
and totally unspoiled.

128
00:17:33,809 --> 00:17:37,074
There you could get
your fill of fresh air...

129
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,071
and you could rest.

130
00:17:42,985 --> 00:17:44,782
I know a place.

131
00:17:45,788 --> 00:17:48,814
You could stay
with the grocer.

132
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:54,155
- But Achille Papin
fell into a kind of melancholy. -

133
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:56,858
- He suddenly saw himself
as an old man... -

134
00:17:56,932 --> 00:18:01,392
- at the end of his career. -

135
00:18:04,206 --> 00:18:08,973
Lord, our God
Thy name and glory

136
00:18:09,044 --> 00:18:15,415
Should be sung
throughout the world

137
00:18:15,484 --> 00:18:19,648
And every soul
Thy humble subjects

138
00:18:19,722 --> 00:18:24,659
And every wayfarer
shall sing aloud

139
00:18:24,727 --> 00:18:29,289
Thy praises

140
00:18:30,132 --> 00:18:35,399
God is God
even if all lands be deserts

141
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:43,909
God is God
even if all life were ended

142
00:18:43,979 --> 00:18:48,939
If the people should vanish
and you, divine heavens

143
00:18:49,018 --> 00:18:56,550
Will reign over the countless
and play the harp so beautifully

144
00:18:58,594 --> 00:19:05,898
Highest mountain
and deepest vale shall vanish

145
00:19:05,968 --> 00:19:12,066
Heaven and earth as well
will perish

146
00:19:12,141 --> 00:19:17,169
Each height and peak
shall be no longer

147
00:19:17,246 --> 00:19:21,683
But the Lord's glory
shall rise again

148
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:25,049
In a thousand hearts

149
00:19:25,888 --> 00:19:27,822
Almighty God...

150
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:29,881
Thy mercy
ascends to the heavens...

151
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:33,485
and Thy righteousness
reaches to the ocean's depths.

152
00:19:33,562 --> 00:19:35,996
Here is a diva.

153
00:19:36,065 --> 00:19:39,057
She will have Paris
at her feet.

154
00:20:28,283 --> 00:20:30,513
Good day, sir.

155
00:20:30,586 --> 00:20:32,451
Good day.

156
00:20:32,521 --> 00:20:36,389
I've come to your country
for reasons of health.

157
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:38,449
I'm staying at the grocer's.

158
00:20:40,195 --> 00:20:43,255
I'd be happy
to give singing lessons...

159
00:20:43,332 --> 00:20:45,823
to the young lady who lives here.

160
00:20:45,901 --> 00:20:49,564
She has a lovely voice,
and with some training...

161
00:20:49,638 --> 00:20:51,663
she will sing like an angel.

162
00:20:54,777 --> 00:20:58,110
That's important
when one sings God's praises.

163
00:20:59,615 --> 00:21:01,674
Are you a Papist?

164
00:21:02,785 --> 00:21:06,346
Yes, Roman Catholic.
Papist.

165
00:21:10,259 --> 00:21:12,124
Come in, Monsieur...

166
00:21:13,128 --> 00:21:16,120
Monsieur Achille Papin.

167
00:21:34,516 --> 00:21:39,180
I spoke with my daughter,
and I give my consent.

168
00:21:39,254 --> 00:21:42,246
I am delighted. Thank you.
Good-bye, sir.

169
00:21:42,324 --> 00:21:44,315
Good-bye, Monsieur Papin.

170
00:21:45,894 --> 00:21:47,452
Good-bye, ladies.

171
00:21:47,529 --> 00:21:49,019
Good-bye, Monsieur.

172
00:21:50,199 --> 00:21:52,190
- See you soon?
- Yes.

173
00:22:02,744 --> 00:22:04,735
Ah, thank you.

174
00:22:35,711 --> 00:22:37,201
Very good.

175
00:22:53,161 --> 00:22:56,153
You will be like a star
in the heavens.

176
00:23:04,406 --> 00:23:08,809
No one ever sang as well
as you will sing.

177
00:23:08,877 --> 00:23:10,868
You will be the only star.

178
00:23:10,946 --> 00:23:14,143
The others will fade out
by themselves.

179
00:23:14,216 --> 00:23:16,650
The Emperor
will come to hear you...

180
00:23:16,718 --> 00:23:18,845
and so will
the modest seamstress.

181
00:23:18,921 --> 00:23:21,219
You have enough talent...

182
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:23,918
to distract the rich...

183
00:23:23,992 --> 00:23:26,460
and to comfort the poor.

184
00:23:36,104 --> 00:23:40,200
Well, Philippa, are you making
progress with Mr. Papin?

185
00:23:41,343 --> 00:23:42,833
Yes, Father.

186
00:23:45,147 --> 00:23:50,312
A voice with in me calls you

187
00:23:50,385 --> 00:23:54,845
It calls you from my heart

188
00:23:54,923 --> 00:23:59,417
Come now
don't fight against it

189
00:23:59,494 --> 00:24:03,794
It is the voice of joy

190
00:24:04,666 --> 00:24:09,262
I tremble, yet I listen

191
00:24:09,338 --> 00:24:14,435
I'm fearful of my joy

192
00:24:14,509 --> 00:24:19,503
Desire, love and doubting

193
00:24:19,581 --> 00:24:24,917
Are battling in my heart

194
00:24:30,425 --> 00:24:35,522
Come, then, with me
my beauty

195
00:24:35,597 --> 00:24:39,931
Masetto still loves me

196
00:24:40,936 --> 00:24:45,669
I'll make you a great lady

197
00:24:45,741 --> 00:24:50,041
My soul weakens already

198
00:24:55,317 --> 00:24:59,515
Come on, come on

199
00:24:59,588 --> 00:25:04,287
Come with thy hand
in mine, dear

200
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:09,922
I would, and yet I would not

201
00:25:09,998 --> 00:25:14,799
Don't fight
It will be fine, dear

202
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:18,636
I'm afraid of my own joy

203
00:25:18,707 --> 00:25:21,835
Let us leave, my beauty

204
00:25:26,415 --> 00:25:30,715
Come, then, with me
my beauty

205
00:25:30,786 --> 00:25:33,653
Masetto still loves me

206
00:25:33,722 --> 00:25:35,656
You will be a great lady

207
00:25:35,724 --> 00:25:38,716
My soul weakens already

208
00:25:44,766 --> 00:25:47,394
Oh, come

209
00:25:47,469 --> 00:25:51,098
Oh, come

210
00:25:51,173 --> 00:25:56,270
Let us go

211
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:01,181
Yes, hand and heart uniting

212
00:26:01,249 --> 00:26:04,776
Each other's love requiting

213
00:26:04,853 --> 00:26:09,483
Love will unite us

214
00:26:51,733 --> 00:26:53,997
Love will unite us...

215
00:27:02,477 --> 00:27:05,002
Love will unite us.

216
00:27:16,658 --> 00:27:20,719
Good day, Madame!
Good day, Madame! La-la-la!

217
00:27:34,276 --> 00:27:37,211
I do not wish to continue
my singing lessons.

218
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,407
Please, Father,
let Monsieur Papin know my decision.

219
00:27:42,651 --> 00:27:47,679
The Lord's paths also run
across the rivers, my child.

220
00:28:16,718 --> 00:28:19,050
Kindly give this to your guest.

221
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,610
Yes, sir.

222
00:28:39,741 --> 00:28:44,576
Good-bye, my life
Good-bye, my heart

223
00:28:47,549 --> 00:28:49,540
Good-bye, my hopes.

224
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,816
- Achille Papin took the first boat
from Frederikshavn... -

225
00:29:22,884 --> 00:29:24,943
- back to Paris. -

226
00:29:51,546 --> 00:29:53,707
That's the house over there.

227
00:30:13,668 --> 00:30:16,569
- Many years later... -

228
00:30:16,638 --> 00:30:21,507
- one September night in 1871. -

229
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:53,464
Come inside.

230
00:32:17,692 --> 00:32:19,182
" Dear ladies...

231
00:32:33,641 --> 00:32:35,131
- Do you remember me? -

232
00:32:38,246 --> 00:32:39,679
- When I think of you... -

233
00:32:39,747 --> 00:32:42,716
- I recall the perfume
of wild lilies of the valley. -

234
00:32:43,651 --> 00:32:47,883
- Could the memory of a Frenchman
who is forever devoted to you... -

235
00:32:47,956 --> 00:32:51,153
- move your hearts to save
the life of a French woman? -

236
00:32:59,234 --> 00:33:03,398
- The unfortunate bearer of this letter,
Madame Babette Hersant -

237
00:33:03,471 --> 00:33:06,338
- like my beautiful Empress herself -

238
00:33:06,407 --> 00:33:08,034
- had to flee from Paris. -

239
00:33:11,346 --> 00:33:14,372
- Civil war has been raging
in our streets. -

240
00:33:14,449 --> 00:33:18,943
- Madame Hersant's husband and son
were killed like rats. -

241
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,052
- She, herself, narrowly escaped... -

242
00:33:24,125 --> 00:33:26,685
- the blood-stained hands
of General Galliffet. -

243
00:33:30,165 --> 00:33:33,362
- She has lost everything
and dares not to remain in France. -

244
00:33:34,836 --> 00:33:38,966
- A nephew of hers works aboard
a ship bound for Frederikshavn. -

245
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,508
- He has arranged
a passage for her. -

246
00:33:41,576 --> 00:33:46,070
- She asked whether I knew
any generous people in Denmark. -

247
00:33:46,147 --> 00:33:50,880
- This evoked my memories of you
that I have cherished. -

248
00:33:54,489 --> 00:33:57,424
- For 35 years, Miss Philippa... -

249
00:34:05,266 --> 00:34:08,394
- I have deplored the fate
that kept your voice... -

250
00:34:08,469 --> 00:34:11,461
- from filling
the Grand Opera House in Paris. -

251
00:34:17,412 --> 00:34:20,347
- When I think of you honored,
respected and surrounded... -

252
00:34:20,415 --> 00:34:24,215
- by a warm and happy swarm
of children... -

253
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:30,123
- and when I think of myself
a lonely, graying old man... -

254
00:34:30,191 --> 00:34:34,628
- forgotten by those
who once applauded and adored me -

255
00:34:34,696 --> 00:34:38,962
- I feel that it is you who
chose the better path in life. -

256
00:34:40,401 --> 00:34:45,600
- What is fame?
The grave that awaits us all. -

257
00:34:45,673 --> 00:34:47,937
- And yet, my beautiful soprano
of the snows... -

258
00:34:48,009 --> 00:34:52,946
- as I write this
I feel the grave is not the end. -

259
00:34:53,014 --> 00:34:56,381
- In Paradise I shall
hear your voice again. -

260
00:34:58,419 --> 00:35:01,479
- There you will forever be
the great artist... -

261
00:35:01,556 --> 00:35:04,719
- God intended you to be. -

262
00:35:04,792 --> 00:35:08,091
- Oh, how you will enchant
the angels. -

263
00:35:08,162 --> 00:35:10,096
- Babette knows how to cook. -

264
00:35:10,565 --> 00:35:14,331
- Ladies, please accept
the humble homage of a friend... -

265
00:35:14,402 --> 00:35:17,394
- who was once Achille Papin. -

266
00:35:19,974 --> 00:35:21,305
Madame...

267
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:26,178
I am afraid
that we cannot employ you.

268
00:35:27,415 --> 00:35:30,873
We do not have
sufficient income...

269
00:35:30,952 --> 00:35:34,046
to allow us to engage...

270
00:35:34,122 --> 00:35:36,955
such an experienced housekeeper.

271
00:35:37,859 --> 00:35:42,319
But I only want to work
for Monsieur Papin's friends.

272
00:35:42,964 --> 00:35:45,558
I will work without wages.

273
00:35:47,368 --> 00:35:50,360
If you won't let me serve you...

274
00:35:50,438 --> 00:35:52,372
I will simply die.

275
00:36:00,014 --> 00:36:02,175
No. Stay with us.

276
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:03,581
Stay.

277
00:36:29,711 --> 00:36:32,373
- Let it soak.
- Yes.

278
00:36:41,089 --> 00:36:43,523
You must soak it.

279
00:36:43,591 --> 00:36:45,491
Yes.

280
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,993
Let it soak.

281
00:36:47,061 --> 00:36:49,359
Let it soak.

282
00:36:59,974 --> 00:37:01,498
Cut slices.

283
00:37:28,102 --> 00:37:29,262
Bread.

284
00:37:30,071 --> 00:37:32,096
Bread.

285
00:37:32,707 --> 00:37:34,368
Let it soak.

286
00:37:40,681 --> 00:37:43,013
A little ale.

287
00:37:43,084 --> 00:37:46,485
- A little ale.
- Ale.

288
00:37:50,324 --> 00:37:52,258
Through a sieve...

289
00:37:52,326 --> 00:37:55,762
like this.

290
00:37:59,767 --> 00:38:02,930
- Ale-bread.
- Ale-bread.

291
00:38:04,005 --> 00:38:06,974
That's right.
Then it cooks for one hour.

292
00:38:07,975 --> 00:38:11,843
- It must be cooked for one hour.
- Cooked.

293
00:38:59,694 --> 00:39:02,686
- Good morning, Mr. Larsen.
- Good morning, Madame Babette.

294
00:39:08,102 --> 00:39:10,093
- Onion.
- Two onions.

295
00:39:10,171 --> 00:39:11,866
Two onions.

296
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,031
- Sugar.
- Sugar.

297
00:39:16,477 --> 00:39:18,672
- 20 skillings.
- 20 skillings?

298
00:39:19,714 --> 00:39:20,840
Twenty.

299
00:39:20,915 --> 00:39:22,815
20 skillings.

300
00:39:24,819 --> 00:39:26,446
Thank you.
Good day, Mr. Larsen.

301
00:39:26,521 --> 00:39:27,920
Good-bye, Madame Babette.

302
00:39:27,989 --> 00:39:29,479
Good-bye.

303
00:39:46,541 --> 00:39:47,974
Here you are.

304
00:39:48,042 --> 00:39:50,033
Thank you, Babette.

305
00:40:17,738 --> 00:40:22,641
Amazing. Since Babette came,
we have more money than before.

306
00:40:27,949 --> 00:40:31,817
- Babette had now worked
for the minister's daughters... -

307
00:40:31,886 --> 00:40:33,877
- for fourteen years. -

308
00:41:11,726 --> 00:41:13,887
- Not fresh.
- Not fresh?

309
00:41:13,961 --> 00:41:15,929
My fish are not fresh?

310
00:41:15,997 --> 00:41:18,363
They were swimming
two minutes ago!

311
00:41:18,432 --> 00:41:20,923
- How much?
- 30 skillings.

312
00:41:21,002 --> 00:41:22,993
- Twenty.
- Thirty.

313
00:41:26,841 --> 00:41:29,275
- Thirty.
- Forty.

314
00:41:29,343 --> 00:41:30,833
Thirty.

315
00:41:32,179 --> 00:41:35,239
All right. Give us your basket
and take them away.

316
00:41:35,316 --> 00:41:36,806
Many thanks!

317
00:41:40,254 --> 00:41:41,949
Those two for 30?

318
00:41:42,023 --> 00:41:43,456
No! That's enough!

319
00:41:43,524 --> 00:41:46,516
These cost 50, and that's that.

320
00:42:06,247 --> 00:42:09,410
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Madame Babette.

321
00:42:09,483 --> 00:42:12,475
I'd like a small piece
of bacon.

322
00:42:13,988 --> 00:42:16,320
The last one I had was rancid.

323
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:17,880
I can't understand that.

324
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,666
In the land where I was born

325
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:33,101
Don't you miss France?

326
00:42:34,108 --> 00:42:38,101
My only link with France
is a lottery ticket...

327
00:42:39,246 --> 00:42:42,875
that a faithful friend in Paris
renews for me every year.

328
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:44,884
Not much of a link.

329
00:42:44,952 --> 00:42:46,943
Thank you very much.
Good-bye.

330
00:42:47,021 --> 00:42:48,750
Good-bye, Madame Babette.

331
00:42:52,793 --> 00:42:54,522
She's a clever one.

332
00:42:54,595 --> 00:42:55,926
Yes.

333
00:42:58,833 --> 00:43:03,133
These sins of your youth
will be forgiven, Christopher.

334
00:43:03,204 --> 00:43:07,698
Christ loved us and cleansed us
of our sins with His blood.

335
00:43:11,445 --> 00:43:12,912
Hallelujah.

336
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:15,972
You who seek Christ...

337
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:19,042
turn your eyes
on the vault of heaven.

338
00:43:20,921 --> 00:43:24,914
There you will see the signs
of His infinite kingdom...

339
00:43:26,193 --> 00:43:28,661
the eternal light.

340
00:43:30,531 --> 00:43:34,592
" For Thine is the kingdom,
the power and the glory...

341
00:43:34,668 --> 00:43:37,364
forever and ever. Amen."

342
00:43:38,372 --> 00:43:43,071
And thank You, Lord,
for sending Babette to us.

343
00:43:44,211 --> 00:43:48,671
She helps our little sisters
so they can devote themselves...

344
00:43:48,749 --> 00:43:52,913
to those most wretched
in Thy little flock.

345
00:44:05,132 --> 00:44:08,863
- As the years went by
the minister's disciples... -

346
00:44:08,936 --> 00:44:10,528
- became somewhat testy
and querulous. -

347
00:44:10,604 --> 00:44:15,166
- Sometimes small schisms
would erupt among the congregation. -

348
00:44:15,242 --> 00:44:19,076
Even though it was
a long time ago, Solveig...

349
00:44:19,146 --> 00:44:25,051
I remember very well
how badly you once treated me.

350
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:28,247
You remember that
I treated you badly.

351
00:44:28,322 --> 00:44:31,052
Well, I remember
how jealous you were.

352
00:44:31,125 --> 00:44:34,185
You were anything but nice
to my poor mother.

353
00:44:35,396 --> 00:44:40,060
Now let us all sing
"Thy kingdom come, O Lord."

354
00:44:48,142 --> 00:44:52,511
My good Paul, you cheated me that time;
I've always known it.

355
00:44:54,448 --> 00:44:57,349
"Always known it." Ha!

356
00:44:57,418 --> 00:45:02,355
You can't even remember
what you had for supper yesterday.

357
00:45:02,857 --> 00:45:07,385
I remember perfectly well.
I always knew you robbed me.

358
00:45:08,195 --> 00:45:11,289
Well, now! May we have
some peace and quiet?

359
00:45:31,485 --> 00:45:35,421
Do you think my dear husband
will forgive me for deceiving him?

360
00:45:35,489 --> 00:45:37,320
Yes.

361
00:45:37,391 --> 00:45:39,859
We were so young.

362
00:45:39,927 --> 00:45:41,554
That's no excuse.

363
00:45:43,163 --> 00:45:46,098
I was married to him.
You made me do it.

364
00:45:46,166 --> 00:45:47,497
Yes.

365
00:45:48,669 --> 00:45:51,502
- But you wanted to yourself.
- You tempted me.

366
00:45:52,539 --> 00:45:54,564
Will God forgive me?

367
00:45:55,075 --> 00:45:59,068
Or will my soul be tormented
for what we did?

368
00:46:00,114 --> 00:46:05,017
Of course not.
God forgives everything.

369
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:07,510
Doesn't He, Martina?

370
00:46:08,489 --> 00:46:11,253
My dear brothers and sisters.

371
00:46:11,325 --> 00:46:15,819
You know that December 15th
is the hundredth anniversary...

372
00:46:15,896 --> 00:46:17,830
of the birth of our dear father.

373
00:46:17,898 --> 00:46:21,493
Philippa and I have long
looked forward to this day.

374
00:46:21,568 --> 00:46:24,594
We wish to celebrate it...

375
00:46:24,672 --> 00:46:28,130
as if our father
we're still with us.

376
00:46:29,376 --> 00:46:32,106
My sister and I
are much grieved...

377
00:46:32,179 --> 00:46:37,276
over the intolerance
and disagreements among us.

378
00:46:40,087 --> 00:46:41,554
Please remember...

379
00:46:41,622 --> 00:46:45,149
that peace and brotherhood
should reign here.

380
00:46:45,225 --> 00:46:49,924
I've seen through you, Christopher.
You are a sly one.

381
00:46:51,298 --> 00:46:52,560
Hallelujah!

382
00:46:52,633 --> 00:46:55,158
That is all for today.

383
00:47:03,711 --> 00:47:05,201
It's from France.

384
00:47:34,341 --> 00:47:35,831
Come in.

385
00:47:43,817 --> 00:47:46,752
It's for Madame Babette Hersant.

386
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:49,345
- Thank you.
- It's from France.

387
00:47:49,423 --> 00:47:50,913
Yes. Thank you.

388
00:47:56,063 --> 00:47:57,860
It's for Babette.

389
00:48:05,439 --> 00:48:07,430
There's a letter for you,
Babette.

390
00:48:09,276 --> 00:48:10,766
Thank you.

391
00:48:57,091 --> 00:48:58,581
Dear God!

392
00:49:01,495 --> 00:49:03,486
I've won in the lottery!

393
00:49:06,633 --> 00:49:08,498
10,000 francs!

394
00:49:20,747 --> 00:49:22,237
Congratulations.

395
00:49:22,316 --> 00:49:24,113
Congratulations, Babette.

396
00:49:24,184 --> 00:49:25,674
Thank you.

397
00:49:37,931 --> 00:49:39,922
Well, it had to happen.

398
00:49:41,368 --> 00:49:42,960
The Lord gave and...

399
00:49:43,036 --> 00:49:44,697
the Lord took away.

400
00:50:14,134 --> 00:50:16,625
- Thank you for helping me.
- You're welcome.

401
00:51:42,623 --> 00:51:44,614
May I ask a favor, ladies?

402
00:51:47,694 --> 00:51:49,218
Of course, Babette.

403
00:51:49,296 --> 00:51:50,729
Sit down, Babette.

404
00:52:00,841 --> 00:52:04,504
I would like to prepare
the celebration dinner...

405
00:52:04,578 --> 00:52:06,068
for the minister's birthday
by myself.

406
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:11,380
But dear Babette, we didn't
intend to give a dinner party.

407
00:52:11,451 --> 00:52:15,285
My sister and I were thinking
of a modest supper...

408
00:52:15,355 --> 00:52:17,789
followed by a cup of coffee.

409
00:52:17,858 --> 00:52:22,352
You know we never offered our guests
anything more than that.

410
00:52:23,664 --> 00:52:25,598
I'd like to prepare
a French dinner.

411
00:52:27,801 --> 00:52:29,098
A French dinner?

412
00:52:31,238 --> 00:52:34,867
Just this once, I beg you.
A real French dinner.

413
00:52:36,410 --> 00:52:38,401
A real French dinner.

414
00:52:40,747 --> 00:52:42,374
All right, Babette.

415
00:52:43,016 --> 00:52:44,483
We agree, Babette.

416
00:52:48,355 --> 00:52:52,883
I would like to pay for the dinner
with my own money.

417
00:52:52,959 --> 00:52:56,554
No, Babette. No.
That's out of the question.

418
00:52:57,831 --> 00:53:01,699
- We could not accept that.
- No, Babette. We couldn't allow that.

419
00:53:04,638 --> 00:53:07,129
Ladies...

420
00:53:07,207 --> 00:53:10,199
have I ever asked you
for anything?

421
00:53:11,211 --> 00:53:13,145
Hear my prayer today.

422
00:53:13,213 --> 00:53:15,204
It comes from my heart.

423
00:53:16,783 --> 00:53:18,375
Babette is right.

424
00:53:18,452 --> 00:53:22,513
It's the first time
she asks us for anything...

425
00:53:24,091 --> 00:53:26,082
and it's probably the last.

426
00:53:27,227 --> 00:53:29,161
So be it, Babette.

427
00:53:29,229 --> 00:53:31,595
- We agree, Babette.
- Thank you.

428
00:53:35,369 --> 00:53:38,304
I'll have to ask for
a few days off...

429
00:53:38,372 --> 00:53:40,602
to give my nephew
some instructions...

430
00:53:40,674 --> 00:53:42,301
concerning the dinner.

431
00:53:42,376 --> 00:53:44,310
Ah, yes, your nephew.

432
00:53:44,378 --> 00:53:49,281
It was his boat that brought you
from France to Frederikshavn.

433
00:53:50,384 --> 00:53:53,842
- Take some time off.
- Of course, Babette.

434
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,911
I thank you, ladies.

435
00:54:10,203 --> 00:54:11,932
She'll be leaving us soon.

436
00:54:12,005 --> 00:54:16,840
Her heart is already in France.

437
00:54:16,910 --> 00:54:19,606
We mustn't neglect
our old people...

438
00:54:19,679 --> 00:54:21,613
when we'll have to manage
by ourselves.

439
00:54:21,681 --> 00:54:25,674
- She'll be back in a week.
- Yes, but for how long?

440
00:55:29,015 --> 00:55:30,505
Thank you, johannes.

441
00:55:38,024 --> 00:55:41,516
Welcome back, Babette.
Did you have a good journey?

442
00:55:42,395 --> 00:55:44,192
Very good, thank you.

443
00:55:44,264 --> 00:55:47,700
Did you make your arrangements
and meet your nephew?

444
00:55:47,767 --> 00:55:50,258
Yes. Everything went well.

445
00:55:50,337 --> 00:55:52,931
I gave my nephew
a list of the goods...

446
00:55:53,006 --> 00:55:56,032
he is to bring me from France.

447
00:56:04,050 --> 00:56:05,483
Careful!

448
00:56:06,253 --> 00:56:08,244
All right.

449
00:56:08,321 --> 00:56:11,654
Martina, I am rather worried
about this.

450
00:56:11,725 --> 00:56:14,922
I am not too happy about
this French dinner either.

451
00:56:32,779 --> 00:56:34,610
My little quails!

452
00:56:38,752 --> 00:56:40,344
There she is.

453
00:57:30,937 --> 00:57:32,404
Praise the Lord!

454
00:57:32,472 --> 00:57:35,066
All the goods arrived safely.

455
00:57:36,610 --> 00:57:38,100
What goods, Babette?

456
00:57:38,178 --> 00:57:42,444
The ingredients for the dinner.
For the French dinner.

457
00:57:44,117 --> 00:57:46,051
Surely that's not wine?

458
00:57:46,119 --> 00:57:49,748
It's Clos de Vougeot 1 845...

459
00:57:51,391 --> 00:57:53,484
from Chez Philippe,
Rue Montorgeuil.

460
00:59:46,540 --> 00:59:49,031
We had no bad intentions.

461
00:59:50,177 --> 00:59:53,840
Philippa and I merely wanted
to grant Babette's wish.

462
00:59:53,914 --> 00:59:58,783
We had no idea
where it might lead.

463
01:00:00,254 --> 01:00:01,653
And now...

464
01:00:02,656 --> 01:00:04,590
we have exposed ourselves...

465
01:00:04,658 --> 01:00:09,118
to dangerous,
or maybe even evil, powers.

466
01:00:10,364 --> 01:00:15,165
I cannot even tell you what you
may be served to eat and drink.

467
01:00:15,235 --> 01:00:17,203
What will happen to us?

468
01:00:17,271 --> 01:00:20,638
Lord, grant us Thy mercy.

469
01:00:20,708 --> 01:00:22,573
Oh. Forgive me.

470
01:00:22,643 --> 01:00:24,634
Don't cry, Martina.

471
01:00:24,712 --> 01:00:27,306
If you only knew how often...

472
01:00:28,449 --> 01:00:30,747
I think of my father now.

473
01:00:30,818 --> 01:00:32,911
I feel he's looking down at me
and is seeing his daughters...

474
01:00:32,986 --> 01:00:38,014
use his home
for a witches' sabbath!

475
01:00:38,092 --> 01:00:43,792
We shall not say a word
about either food or drink.

476
01:00:43,864 --> 01:00:45,889
Hallelujah.

477
01:00:45,966 --> 01:00:49,402
For the love
of our little sisters...

478
01:00:49,470 --> 01:00:52,701
we promise,
no matter what happens...

479
01:00:52,773 --> 01:00:56,937
not to say a single word
about the food or the drinks.

480
01:00:57,010 --> 01:01:00,411
Not one comment
will pass our lips.

481
01:01:00,481 --> 01:01:02,506
The tongue.

482
01:01:02,583 --> 01:01:06,144
The tongue,
this strange little muscle...

483
01:01:06,220 --> 01:01:11,715
has accomplished great
and glorious deeds for man.

484
01:01:11,792 --> 01:01:16,559
But it is also the source
of unleashed evil and deadly poison.

485
01:01:17,998 --> 01:01:22,094
On the day when we solemnly
pay homage to our great master...

486
01:01:22,169 --> 01:01:24,933
we shall use our tongues
for prayer...

487
01:01:26,006 --> 01:01:29,339
in gratitude
for all he meant to us.

488
01:01:29,910 --> 01:01:31,275
The Lord be praised.

489
01:01:31,345 --> 01:01:33,108
Grant us Thy salvation.

490
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:41,082
It will be as if we never
had the sense of taste.

491
01:01:42,189 --> 01:01:47,149
Jerusalem
my heart's true home

492
01:01:47,227 --> 01:01:52,028
Your name
is forever dear to me

493
01:01:52,099 --> 01:01:56,126
Your kindness
is second to none

494
01:01:56,203 --> 01:02:01,197
You keep us clothed and fed

495
01:02:01,275 --> 01:02:05,541
Never would you give a stone

496
01:02:05,612 --> 01:02:09,446
To the child
who begs for bread

497
01:02:27,134 --> 01:02:29,068
Here is a letter
from Mrs. Lowenhielm.

498
01:02:29,136 --> 01:02:34,665
Thank you. Get yourself
some refreshments in the kitchen.

499
01:02:38,245 --> 01:02:41,078
This is from Mrs. Lowenhielm.

500
01:02:47,621 --> 01:02:50,590
She writes that she has
an unexpected visit...

501
01:02:50,657 --> 01:02:53,990
from her nephew,
General Lorens Lowenhielm.

502
01:02:56,530 --> 01:03:00,022
He has spoken of our father
with admiration.

503
01:03:01,468 --> 01:03:04,960
She asks if she may bring him
with her this evening.

504
01:03:09,142 --> 01:03:11,372
We have had a message
from Mrs. Lowenhielm.

505
01:03:11,445 --> 01:03:15,905
Her nephew, General Lorens Lowenhielm,
will accompany her.

506
01:03:15,983 --> 01:03:19,612
So we shall be twelve for dinner,
not eleven.

507
01:03:19,686 --> 01:03:22,655
The general is with
the Royal Swedish Court.

508
01:03:22,723 --> 01:03:25,556
During his youth
he lived in Paris.

509
01:03:25,626 --> 01:03:27,116
A general.

510
01:03:28,395 --> 01:03:32,058
Do not worry.
There will be plenty for everyone.

511
01:04:17,844 --> 01:04:20,574
This is for the turtle soup.

512
01:04:20,647 --> 01:04:22,137
It is?

513
01:04:30,257 --> 01:04:31,747
Hold that end.

514
01:04:48,141 --> 01:04:50,575
Is there anything you need,
Babette?

515
01:04:50,644 --> 01:04:53,636
No. Everything is ready.

516
01:05:05,292 --> 01:05:06,725
The candles.

517
01:05:41,995 --> 01:05:43,485
Vanity.

518
01:05:47,134 --> 01:05:49,125
Vanity.

519
01:05:51,338 --> 01:05:52,828
All...

520
01:05:54,207 --> 01:05:56,198
is vanity.

521
01:06:16,963 --> 01:06:19,955
I have found everything
you dreamed of...

522
01:06:21,201 --> 01:06:23,795
and satisfied your ambition.

523
01:06:25,405 --> 01:06:27,396
But to what purpose?

524
01:06:28,508 --> 01:06:31,841
Tonight we two
shall settle our score.

525
01:06:32,779 --> 01:06:37,182
You must prove to me that
the choice I made was the right one.

526
01:07:01,708 --> 01:07:04,074
God's will be done.

527
01:07:39,246 --> 01:07:42,215
Good evening.
Thank you, Philippa.

528
01:07:42,282 --> 01:07:45,046
Come inside where it's warm.

529
01:08:08,675 --> 01:08:10,165
They're here.

530
01:08:17,284 --> 01:08:23,223
Jerusalem
my heart's true home

531
01:08:23,290 --> 01:08:28,284
Your name
is forever dear to me

532
01:08:29,830 --> 01:08:34,699
Your kindness
is second to none

533
01:08:34,768 --> 01:08:41,640
You keep us clothed and fed

534
01:08:41,708 --> 01:08:47,044
Never would you give a stone

535
01:08:47,113 --> 01:08:54,144
To the child
who begs for bread

536
01:09:49,209 --> 01:09:53,908
Could many years of victories...

537
01:09:53,980 --> 01:09:55,971
result in defeat?

538
01:10:17,971 --> 01:10:21,805
Well!
Here comes the general.

539
01:10:21,875 --> 01:10:24,105
And our dear old
Mrs. Lowenhielm.

540
01:10:24,177 --> 01:10:27,169
She is one of the faithful.

541
01:10:33,820 --> 01:10:36,812
Welcome to you all.

542
01:10:39,159 --> 01:10:41,457
It was so good of you
to invite us.

543
01:10:41,528 --> 01:10:43,393
Thank you for inviting me.

544
01:10:43,463 --> 01:10:46,455
Thank you for coming
such a long way.

545
01:10:53,006 --> 01:10:54,701
Good evening, Mrs. Lowenhielm.

546
01:11:01,247 --> 01:11:04,842
Good evening, dear sisters.
Good evening, dear brothers.

547
01:11:08,088 --> 01:11:09,817
Please sit down.

548
01:11:13,727 --> 01:11:15,058
Good evening.

549
01:11:39,586 --> 01:11:41,952
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

550
01:11:45,191 --> 01:11:47,853
Come inside where it's warm.

551
01:11:47,927 --> 01:11:49,224
Thanks.

552
01:11:49,295 --> 01:11:51,695
Now we're ready to serve.

553
01:12:00,507 --> 01:12:02,532
Babette says dinner is served.

554
01:12:03,209 --> 01:12:07,202
Let us take our places
at the table.

555
01:13:14,447 --> 01:13:17,473
Remember, we have lost
our sense of taste.

556
01:13:18,384 --> 01:13:21,353
Let us pray,
using the minister's own words.

557
01:13:22,355 --> 01:13:26,052
May the bread
nourish my body.

558
01:13:26,126 --> 01:13:29,857
May my body
do my soul's bidding.

559
01:13:29,929 --> 01:13:33,763
May my soul rise up
to serve God eternally.

560
01:13:33,833 --> 01:13:35,596
Amen.

561
01:13:45,745 --> 01:13:49,306
- Not a word about the food.
- Not a word.

562
01:13:50,650 --> 01:13:52,584
Like the wedding at Cana...

563
01:13:52,652 --> 01:13:55,212
the food is of no importance.

564
01:13:55,288 --> 01:13:57,279
We won't even think about it.

565
01:14:11,938 --> 01:14:13,599
Amazing!

566
01:14:16,910 --> 01:14:18,901
An amontillado!

567
01:14:23,583 --> 01:14:26,984
And the finest amontillado
I have ever tasted!

568
01:14:34,060 --> 01:14:37,552
This is quite definitely
real turtle soup.

569
01:14:48,708 --> 01:14:51,074
And what a turtle soup!

570
01:15:13,132 --> 01:15:17,125
Now, Erik, the champagne.
One glass per person.

571
01:15:17,203 --> 01:15:21,037
And fill the general's glass
whenever it is empty.

572
01:15:30,416 --> 01:15:33,214
It must be some kind
of lemonade.

573
01:15:49,335 --> 01:15:50,825
This is good.

574
01:16:26,572 --> 01:16:28,563
- Here you are, sir.
- Thank you.

575
01:16:36,082 --> 01:16:38,676
But that's Blinis Demidoff!.

576
01:16:51,097 --> 01:16:54,965
And this most certainly is
Veuve Clicquot 1 860!

577
01:16:56,202 --> 01:17:01,572
Uh, yes, uh-- I am quite sure
it will snow all day tomorrow.

578
01:17:19,192 --> 01:17:22,992
I shall never forget
my first meeting with the minister...

579
01:17:23,763 --> 01:17:26,823
and the sermon he preached.

580
01:17:26,899 --> 01:17:30,335
I was a depraved
and quarrelsome person.

581
01:17:32,972 --> 01:17:37,432
I have tried to become
a good Christian.

582
01:17:37,510 --> 01:17:39,808
Do you remember
what he taught us?

583
01:17:39,879 --> 01:17:43,280
" Little children,
love one another."

584
01:17:44,384 --> 01:17:47,842
Little children,
love one another.

585
01:17:48,855 --> 01:17:53,053
Friends, I can assure you
the minister's collected sermons...

586
01:17:53,126 --> 01:17:57,119
are among the favorite reading
of Her Majesty, the Queen.

587
01:18:41,307 --> 01:18:44,299
In the large glasses.

588
01:18:44,377 --> 01:18:45,867
Carefully!

589
01:18:50,249 --> 01:18:51,773
This is good.

590
01:18:51,851 --> 01:18:53,341
This is good.

591
01:18:58,291 --> 01:18:59,724
Remember the time--

592
01:18:59,792 --> 01:19:03,125
indeed, it was almost
a miracle--

593
01:19:03,196 --> 01:19:06,427
when our minister had promised
to conduct a Christmas sermon...

594
01:19:06,499 --> 01:19:08,490
at the church across the fjord?

595
01:19:10,303 --> 01:19:13,067
For two weeks the weather
had been so bad...

596
01:19:13,139 --> 01:19:16,302
that no captain or fisherman
would risk the crossing.

597
01:19:17,543 --> 01:19:20,671
The villagers
had given up all hope.

598
01:19:20,746 --> 01:19:25,740
The minister told them
if no boat would take him...

599
01:19:25,818 --> 01:19:28,582
he would walk across to them
on the waves.

600
01:19:28,654 --> 01:19:33,148
And behold, three days before Christmas
the storm abated.

601
01:19:33,226 --> 01:19:39,131
A cold spell set in and the fjord
froze from shore to shore.

602
01:19:39,198 --> 01:19:43,225
And this had never happened before
in any man's memory.

603
01:20:23,376 --> 01:20:27,506
One day in Paris, after I had
won a riding competition...

604
01:20:28,047 --> 01:20:33,144
my French fellow officers
invited me out to dine...

605
01:20:33,219 --> 01:20:38,282
at one of the finest restaurants,
the Cafe Anglais.

606
01:20:38,357 --> 01:20:42,418
The chef, surprisingly enough,
was a woman.

607
01:20:44,297 --> 01:20:46,891
We were served
Cailles en Sarcophage...

608
01:20:48,367 --> 01:20:50,358
a dish of her own creation.

609
01:20:51,904 --> 01:20:55,533
General Galliffet,
who was our host for the evening...

610
01:20:55,608 --> 01:20:58,736
explained that this woman,
this head chef...

611
01:20:59,178 --> 01:21:00,611
had the ability...

612
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:05,708
to transform a dinner
into a kind of love affair.

613
01:21:05,785 --> 01:21:09,516
A love affair
that made no distinction...

614
01:21:09,589 --> 01:21:13,923
between bodily appetite
and spiritual appetite.

615
01:21:14,994 --> 01:21:18,054
General Galliffet said
that in the past...

616
01:21:18,130 --> 01:21:22,362
he had fought a duel
for the love of a beautiful woman.

617
01:21:22,435 --> 01:21:25,029
But now there was
no woman in Paris...

618
01:21:25,104 --> 01:21:30,770
for whom he would shed his blood--
except for this chef.

619
01:21:31,811 --> 01:21:35,907
She was considered
the greatest culinary genius.

620
01:21:37,416 --> 01:21:39,941
What we are now eating...

621
01:21:40,019 --> 01:21:43,011
is nothing less than
Cailles en Sarcophage.

622
01:21:44,023 --> 01:21:45,581
Hallelujah.

623
01:21:46,258 --> 01:21:48,522
But this really is
a Caille en Sarcophage!

624
01:21:49,428 --> 01:21:51,988
Yes. That it is.

625
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:17,582
Man shall not merely
refrain from...

626
01:22:17,657 --> 01:22:21,650
but also reject any thought
of food and drink.

627
01:22:21,727 --> 01:22:25,891
Only then can he eat and drink
in the proper spirit.

628
01:22:50,623 --> 01:22:52,818
As our minister always said:

629
01:22:52,892 --> 01:22:54,416
" Dear brothers and sisters...

630
01:22:55,428 --> 01:22:59,194
the only things we can take away
from this Earthly life...

631
01:22:59,265 --> 01:23:01,358
are those we have given away."

632
01:23:02,368 --> 01:23:05,963
Our dear sisters
will be rich in the next life.

633
01:23:18,050 --> 01:23:19,540
Erik!

634
01:23:22,922 --> 01:23:24,412
No, no, no.

635
01:24:37,797 --> 01:24:39,287
A good meal, eh, Aunt?

636
01:24:40,299 --> 01:24:42,790
Yes.
The gale has died down.

637
01:25:22,908 --> 01:25:25,001
Water in the small glasses.

638
01:26:25,871 --> 01:26:27,361
Here you are, sir.

639
01:26:29,909 --> 01:26:32,469
Did you see
these beautiful grapes?

640
01:26:33,579 --> 01:26:36,412
"And they came unto
the valley of Eshcol...

641
01:26:36,482 --> 01:26:40,942
and cut down a branch
with a cluster of raisins.

642
01:26:41,020 --> 01:26:44,114
And two of them
bore it upon a staff."

643
01:26:54,566 --> 01:26:58,627
Mercy and truth
have met together.

644
01:26:59,672 --> 01:27:02,664
Righteousness and bliss
shall kiss one another.

645
01:27:04,677 --> 01:27:08,306
Man, in his weakness
and shortsightedness...

646
01:27:08,380 --> 01:27:12,441
believes he must make
choices in this life.

647
01:27:13,619 --> 01:27:17,248
He trembles
at the risks he takes.

648
01:27:19,458 --> 01:27:23,394
We do know fear.

649
01:27:27,099 --> 01:27:28,999
But no.

650
01:27:29,068 --> 01:27:32,765
Our choice
is of no importance.

651
01:27:35,307 --> 01:27:39,209
There comes a time
when your eyes are opened.

652
01:27:39,278 --> 01:27:42,372
And we come to realize...

653
01:27:42,448 --> 01:27:45,849
that mercy is infinite.

654
01:27:47,319 --> 01:27:50,447
We need only await it
with confidence...

655
01:27:51,457 --> 01:27:54,858
and receive it with gratitude.

656
01:27:57,696 --> 01:28:01,223
Mercy imposes no conditions.

657
01:28:04,603 --> 01:28:06,161
And, lo!

658
01:28:06,972 --> 01:28:08,633
Everything we have chosen...

659
01:28:09,641 --> 01:28:12,235
has been granted to us.

660
01:28:13,045 --> 01:28:14,535
And everything...

661
01:28:16,615 --> 01:28:17,912
we rejected...

662
01:28:20,052 --> 01:28:21,485
has also been granted.

663
01:28:21,553 --> 01:28:26,923
Yes, we even get back
what we rejected.

664
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:32,824
For mercy and truth
are met together.

665
01:28:34,867 --> 01:28:37,131
And righteousness and bliss...

666
01:28:38,871 --> 01:28:40,862
shall kiss one another.

667
01:28:52,818 --> 01:28:54,308
Here you are, sir.

668
01:29:18,877 --> 01:29:23,746
You rascal! You did cheat me
with that timber you sold me!

669
01:29:23,816 --> 01:29:28,480
Yes, dear brother. I cheated you
more than you realized.

670
01:29:31,723 --> 01:29:33,156
I knew.

671
01:29:33,225 --> 01:29:37,286
But I played a trick on you,
and you never knew.

672
01:29:37,362 --> 01:29:39,830
Then I deserved it.

673
01:30:20,239 --> 01:30:23,231
Is there more of the
Clos de Vougeot, my lad?

674
01:30:26,712 --> 01:30:29,840
Can the general have
more Clojouvo?

675
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:37,512
Erik, leave the bottle in there.

676
01:31:19,164 --> 01:31:22,224
After the coffee,
in the small glasses.

677
01:31:22,301 --> 01:31:25,236
And light the candles
in the sitting room.

678
01:31:25,304 --> 01:31:28,796
"Vie... ux... marc...
fine... champagne."

679
01:31:30,976 --> 01:31:32,910
May this meal have pleased you.

680
01:31:32,978 --> 01:31:34,969
Thank you. Thank you.

681
01:32:20,092 --> 01:32:22,754
God bless you, dear Solveig.

682
01:32:22,828 --> 01:32:25,820
God bless you too, dear Anna.

683
01:32:27,266 --> 01:32:29,461
God bless you, Christopher.

684
01:32:31,503 --> 01:32:33,528
My brother!

685
01:32:36,742 --> 01:32:43,011
Oh, watch the day
once again hurry off

686
01:32:43,081 --> 01:32:50,146
And the sunbathe itself
in water

687
01:32:50,222 --> 01:32:57,390
The time for us to rest
approaches

688
01:32:57,462 --> 01:33:04,095
O God, Who dwelleth
in heavenly light

689
01:33:04,169 --> 01:33:11,075
Who reigns above
in heaven' shall

690
01:33:11,143 --> 01:33:18,777
Be for us our infinite Light
in the valley of night

691
01:33:19,685 --> 01:33:26,454
The sand in our hour glass
will soon run out

692
01:33:26,525 --> 01:33:33,158
The day is conquered
by the night

693
01:33:33,231 --> 01:33:40,160
The glories of the world
are ending

694
01:33:40,238 --> 01:33:45,676
So brief their day
So swift their flight

695
01:33:47,346 --> 01:33:54,275
God, let Thy brightness
ever shine

696
01:33:54,353 --> 01:34:01,691
Admit us Thy mercy divine

697
01:34:19,811 --> 01:34:21,301
Lorens.

698
01:34:22,447 --> 01:34:25,541
It is time for us to go home.

699
01:34:25,617 --> 01:34:28,609
The general and his aunt
are about to leave.

700
01:34:34,159 --> 01:34:37,651
- Thank you for the nice evening.
- Thanks for your help.

701
01:34:39,798 --> 01:34:41,288
I thank you.

702
01:34:54,112 --> 01:34:56,103
I have been with you...

703
01:34:57,449 --> 01:34:59,474
every day of my life.

704
01:35:02,487 --> 01:35:05,183
Tell me you know that.

705
01:35:05,257 --> 01:35:08,749
Yes, I know it.

706
01:35:08,827 --> 01:35:13,423
You must also know
that I shall be with you...

707
01:35:13,498 --> 01:35:16,990
every day that is granted to me
from now on.

708
01:35:18,503 --> 01:35:22,803
Every evening I shall sit down
to dine with you.

709
01:35:24,342 --> 01:35:29,905
Not with my body,
which is of no importance...

710
01:35:31,683 --> 01:35:33,674
but with my soul.

711
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:38,853
Because this evening
I have learned, my dear...

712
01:35:40,025 --> 01:35:42,960
that in this beautiful
world of ours...

713
01:35:43,028 --> 01:35:45,826
all things are possible.

714
01:37:11,950 --> 01:37:17,252
The clock strikes
and time goes by

715
01:37:17,322 --> 01:37:23,158
Eternity is nigh

716
01:37:23,228 --> 01:37:28,632
Let us use this time to try

717
01:37:28,700 --> 01:37:34,161
To serve the Lord
with heart and mind

718
01:37:34,673 --> 01:37:39,838
So that our true home
we shall find

719
01:37:39,911 --> 01:37:45,178
So that our true home
we shall find

720
01:37:48,486 --> 01:37:51,887
The stars have moved closer.

721
01:37:51,957 --> 01:37:54,949
Perhaps they move closer
every night.

722
01:37:56,227 --> 01:37:59,719
Perhaps there will be
no snow this year.

723
01:38:01,399 --> 01:38:03,492
Hallelujah.

724
01:38:09,240 --> 01:38:12,732
Oh, that was indeed
a very good dinner.

725
01:38:14,479 --> 01:38:17,573
They all thought
it was a very good dinner.

726
01:38:19,284 --> 01:38:23,846
At one time I was the head chef
at the Cafe Anglais.

727
01:38:25,557 --> 01:38:27,491
We shall all remember
this evening...

728
01:38:27,559 --> 01:38:29,857
when you are back in Paris.

729
01:38:32,931 --> 01:38:35,491
I'm not going back to Paris.

730
01:38:45,877 --> 01:38:48,710
You're not going back to Paris?

731
01:38:48,780 --> 01:38:51,681
There's no one
waiting for me there.

732
01:38:51,750 --> 01:38:53,877
They're all dead.

733
01:38:58,156 --> 01:38:59,589
And I have no money.

734
01:39:00,992 --> 01:39:02,482
No money?

735
01:39:04,129 --> 01:39:06,097
But the 10,000 francs?

736
01:39:06,164 --> 01:39:08,257
All spent.

737
01:39:09,868 --> 01:39:12,496
10,000 francs?

738
01:39:14,039 --> 01:39:18,533
Dinner for twelve at the Cafe Anglais
costs 10,000 francs.

739
01:39:19,544 --> 01:39:20,977
But dear Babette...

740
01:39:21,046 --> 01:39:24,482
you should not have given
all you owned for us.

741
01:39:29,421 --> 01:39:32,822
It was not just for you.

742
01:39:33,324 --> 01:39:36,816
Now you'll be poor
the rest of your life.

743
01:39:40,098 --> 01:39:42,692
An artist is never poor.

744
01:39:52,243 --> 01:39:55,770
Did you prepare that sort of dinner
at the Cafe Anglais?

745
01:40:00,085 --> 01:40:02,815
I was able to make them happy.

746
01:40:02,887 --> 01:40:07,290
When I gave of my very best.
Papin knew that.

747
01:40:09,194 --> 01:40:12,925
Achille Papin?

748
01:40:12,997 --> 01:40:14,589
Yes.

749
01:40:14,666 --> 01:40:16,930
He said:

750
01:40:17,001 --> 01:40:21,734
"Throughout the world sounds one
long cry from the heart of the artist:

751
01:40:21,806 --> 01:40:25,742
Give me the chance
to do my very best."

752
01:40:26,811 --> 01:40:29,803
But this is not the end,
Babette.

753
01:40:30,815 --> 01:40:33,784
I'm certain it is not.

754
01:40:34,786 --> 01:40:35,810
In Paradise...

755
01:40:36,721 --> 01:40:40,157
you will be the great artist...

756
01:40:40,225 --> 01:40:42,921
that God meant you to be.

757
01:40:53,938 --> 01:40:59,604
Ah, how you will delight
the angels!

758
01:43:00,632 --> 01:43:05,467
