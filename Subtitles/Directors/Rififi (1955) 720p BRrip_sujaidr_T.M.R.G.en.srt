1
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,560
RIFIFI

2
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:20,130
Full house.

3
00:02:33,051 --> 00:02:33,691
Paulo...

4
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:36,611
Stake me.

5
00:02:36,731 --> 00:02:39,571
Impossible, Tony.
Not during a game.

6
00:02:43,212 --> 00:02:46,292
OK, I'll call for cash.

7
00:02:58,253 --> 00:03:01,253
Who's trying to hang
me in the closet?

8
00:03:06,614 --> 00:03:08,134
Hey, mister, watch the cuff!

9
00:03:09,214 --> 00:03:12,014
Tonio, will you leave
your father in peace!

10
00:03:12,254 --> 00:03:13,614
You're spoiling him rotten, Jo.

11
00:03:27,335 --> 00:03:29,135
Yes, he's here.

12
00:03:29,535 --> 00:03:30,216
It's Tony.

13
00:03:37,376 --> 00:03:38,576
Cut it out, Tonio!

14
00:03:39,256 --> 00:03:42,137
No, not you. It's your
godson crushing my toes.

15
00:03:46,137 --> 00:03:46,737
Sure thing.

16
00:03:48,217 --> 00:03:49,057
Be right over.

17
00:03:58,818 --> 00:04:00,658
- How about me?
- We don't bet promises here.

18
00:04:01,098 --> 00:04:03,138
No cash, no cards.

19
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,500
Hi, Jo.
So you're the back-up.

20
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,020
Someone's gotta be.

21
00:04:38,701 --> 00:04:39,741
You waiting for me?

22
00:04:40,221 --> 00:04:43,102
Yeah. Their faith is touching.

23
00:04:44,262 --> 00:04:47,702
But you all know him,
he's Tony the Stephanois!

24
00:04:48,062 --> 00:04:50,182
Tony or no Tony,
only one thing counts...

25
00:04:50,382 --> 00:04:51,342
Hard cash.

26
00:04:54,263 --> 00:04:55,343
Forget these lugs.

27
00:04:57,183 --> 00:04:58,663
Hey, you!

28
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:06,184
- You're not polite.
- That bug you?

29
00:05:08,264 --> 00:05:09,784
Relax. He's still green.

30
00:05:16,624 --> 00:05:17,504
Let's go.

31
00:05:24,185 --> 00:05:25,105
Hello, Suzanne.

32
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:31,186
Poor Tony's not a pretty sight.

33
00:05:32,626 --> 00:05:34,146
Five years in the pen
marks a man.

34
00:05:34,786 --> 00:05:38,786
Poker all night in a smoke-filled
room! Just what you need!

35
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:43,547
Get out to the country.
Get some air in your lungs.

36
00:05:44,027 --> 00:05:45,987
You see me milking cows?

37
00:05:47,667 --> 00:05:49,187
It's a bit late for that now.

38
00:05:50,067 --> 00:05:52,667
We'll talk about it tonight
at the house over some grub.

39
00:05:53,307 --> 00:05:56,268
Louise keeps busting my chops
about your damned health.

40
00:05:59,788 --> 00:06:03,628
OK, doc. Drop me off
at my place. I'm beat.

41
00:06:03,748 --> 00:06:06,509
I wanna show you something first.

42
00:06:31,271 --> 00:06:32,631
- What'll you have?
- Coffee.

43
00:06:33,151 --> 00:06:34,791
- Three coffees.
- Three?

44
00:06:37,031 --> 00:06:38,111
Mario's coming.

45
00:06:45,192 --> 00:06:47,632
- Thanks.
- Shut up! Thanks for what?

46
00:06:48,552 --> 00:06:52,072
If you'd squawked 5 years ago,
you'd be slipping me a roll now.

47
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:54,152
And I'd be thanking you.

48
00:06:55,033 --> 00:06:57,793
You took the rap
because I was just a kid then.

49
00:07:00,393 --> 00:07:03,313
Tony... I hear Mado's back.

50
00:07:04,313 --> 00:07:05,193
You sure?

51
00:07:06,633 --> 00:07:10,034
I've been waiting 5 years for this.
Where is she?

52
00:07:10,634 --> 00:07:12,714
Dunno yet, but we'll find her.

53
00:07:13,714 --> 00:07:14,754
Thanks, waiter.

54
00:07:17,154 --> 00:07:19,115
You make me feel young again.

55
00:07:19,675 --> 00:07:23,195
- Good, we need a young man.
- Let's hear it.

56
00:07:32,276 --> 00:07:33,156
So?

57
00:07:33,276 --> 00:07:35,596
Aren't you fed up
with cheap poker games?

58
00:07:35,796 --> 00:07:37,236
Let's hear it, I said.

59
00:07:42,236 --> 00:07:45,557
"Webb"? You're nuts!
Why not the Bank of France?

60
00:07:46,237 --> 00:07:49,117
- Time was you'd jump at it.
- Time was, Mario.

61
00:07:50,597 --> 00:07:54,037
The place has more alarms
than a firehouse.

62
00:07:54,197 --> 00:07:55,558
We don't have to go in.

63
00:07:55,838 --> 00:07:59,278
The 3 rocks in the window alone
are worth a fortune.

64
00:08:00,318 --> 00:08:02,478
Remember the Bond Street job.

65
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:07,038
I remember. They cut out
the glass in broad daylight.

66
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,719
- And cleaned up in 17 seconds.
- A piece of cake.

67
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:13,119
We've timed it at least 20 times.

68
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:18,199
We attack at 1:06.
The street's not too busy then.

69
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:20,800
You're parked over there.

70
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,720
The light at the intersection
goes red. Traffic stops.

71
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:30,040
You pull up, we start, we cut.

72
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,281
When the light's green,
we drive off with the rocks.

73
00:08:35,161 --> 00:08:37,281
- Yeah, you gotta be young.
- You in?

74
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:45,042
Sorry, guys.
I don't run so fast anymore.

75
00:08:56,163 --> 00:08:57,563
- Wind it up.
- Again?

76
00:08:58,723 --> 00:09:02,163
Come here.
It's you I'm gonna wind up.

77
00:09:05,563 --> 00:09:07,243
The penguin's cry...

78
00:09:09,684 --> 00:09:10,644
Time for bed.

79
00:09:12,404 --> 00:09:14,284
Your penguin has to go beddy-bye.

80
00:09:16,644 --> 00:09:17,644
Good night, junior.

81
00:09:23,325 --> 00:09:25,205
How's it going, Mario?

82
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,125
Thanks for the penguin,
Uncle Tony.

83
00:09:29,365 --> 00:09:33,166
I'll see.

84
00:09:34,526 --> 00:09:36,246
I hit the bull's-eye
with that penguin.

85
00:09:38,766 --> 00:09:41,206
Ever heard of the "L'Age d'Or"
in Montmartre?

86
00:09:41,606 --> 00:09:42,286
Why?

87
00:09:45,607 --> 00:09:49,207
Mado works there.
She looks after the girls.

88
00:09:50,687 --> 00:09:54,247
She's shacked up with the boss,
Pierre Grutter. Know him?

89
00:09:55,848 --> 00:09:59,848
Vaguely. His kid brother's
a junkie, I think.

90
00:10:00,528 --> 00:10:02,248
Yeah, he's hooked bad.

91
00:10:02,728 --> 00:10:06,168
And they say Grutter is
too friendly with the cops.

92
00:10:13,209 --> 00:10:15,169
Kiss Louise for me.
I'm turning in.

93
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:27,090
Don't go there alone.
They're tough customers.

94
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:30,610
Hear what I said?

95
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:32,451
I'm not deaf.

96
00:10:35,651 --> 00:10:39,131
The show's about to begin!

97
00:10:53,092 --> 00:10:54,212
Check your hat, sir?

98
00:11:10,174 --> 00:11:11,774
This one's not empty yet!

99
00:11:12,094 --> 00:11:14,254
So what?
You got moths in your wallet?

100
00:11:15,094 --> 00:11:16,254
Oh, all right.

101
00:11:18,734 --> 00:11:20,815
That's a good one,
"Moths in your wallet"!

102
00:11:29,775 --> 00:11:31,135
Beat it, chump!

103
00:11:32,095 --> 00:11:32,656
Scram!

104
00:11:33,216 --> 00:11:34,216
Do as he says.

105
00:11:35,256 --> 00:11:36,496
- Check!
- I'll get it.

106
00:11:43,816 --> 00:11:44,657
Coming, Mado?

107
00:11:45,177 --> 00:11:47,577
Tony, I thought you were still...

108
00:11:47,697 --> 00:11:50,657
As you can see, they let me out.

109
00:11:52,137 --> 00:11:53,777
For good behavior.

110
00:12:10,059 --> 00:12:10,819
Go on in.

111
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,260
Have a seat.

112
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:30,580
Not very fancy, eh?
When a man's alone...

113
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,861
Nothing like our old place.
You fixed it up nice.

114
00:12:37,061 --> 00:12:39,101
How much did you unload it
for while I was inside?

115
00:12:41,341 --> 00:12:43,501
You never had a head
for figures.

116
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:46,862
I got busted in May.

117
00:12:48,342 --> 00:12:50,862
In June you were on the Riviera
with a gigolo.

118
00:12:51,222 --> 00:12:52,702
You didn't lose any time.

119
00:12:53,142 --> 00:12:54,142
I thought I loved him.

120
00:12:54,622 --> 00:12:56,062
Stop it, you're making me cry.

121
00:12:56,623 --> 00:12:57,583
It's true, Tony.

122
00:13:02,263 --> 00:13:05,823
And now it's the likes
of Pierre Grutter.

123
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:10,424
I had Jo on my tail.
He could've gotten nasty.

124
00:13:10,544 --> 00:13:13,744
I knew it, so I left.
I met Grutter in Morocco.

125
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:16,624
It was him or someone else.

126
00:13:20,544 --> 00:13:21,585
Nice sparkler.

127
00:13:23,185 --> 00:13:25,705
- Did he...?
- No. I earned it.

128
00:13:26,585 --> 00:13:27,825
You always did manage.

129
00:13:28,385 --> 00:13:29,305
Do what you want.

130
00:13:35,546 --> 00:13:36,586
I'd like to help you.

131
00:13:38,266 --> 00:13:40,266
No kidding.

132
00:13:42,786 --> 00:13:44,586
Put the ring on the table.

133
00:13:51,267 --> 00:13:52,267
The bracelet.

134
00:14:05,668 --> 00:14:06,588
Fine.

135
00:14:08,188 --> 00:14:09,469
Now the coat.

136
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,149
Come here.

137
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,110
The rest of it.

138
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:44,791
All of it.

139
00:14:56,072 --> 00:14:57,593
Believe me, Tony,
I never forgot you!

140
00:14:58,633 --> 00:14:59,793
Please, Tony!

141
00:15:10,514 --> 00:15:11,474
Get dressed.

142
00:15:35,276 --> 00:15:36,396
Beat it!

143
00:15:36,596 --> 00:15:38,156
- Let me dress!
- Out!

144
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:22,120
Hello, Jo... it's Tony.

145
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,200
Meet me at Mario's right away.

146
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,760
The job interests me after all.

147
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,080
A man's gotta live.

148
00:16:42,761 --> 00:16:44,801
Not so hard.

149
00:16:45,121 --> 00:16:46,162
Go easy.

150
00:17:07,643 --> 00:17:09,443
Hi, Ida, taking a bath?

151
00:17:09,763 --> 00:17:11,084
Not me. Mario.

152
00:17:16,324 --> 00:17:19,284
Knock first! A little decency!

153
00:17:20,724 --> 00:17:23,605
Tony's thought it over.
He's in.

154
00:17:24,725 --> 00:17:25,525
No kidding.

155
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:27,605
Is it true?

156
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:34,286
This is a cause for celebration!

157
00:17:41,206 --> 00:17:43,286
- It's gonna be sheer genius!
- Mario, my carpet!

158
00:17:46,167 --> 00:17:48,447
Go to bed, pet.
We have to talk.

159
00:17:49,127 --> 00:17:51,087
Warm up my side.

160
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,127
Good night.

161
00:18:00,808 --> 00:18:02,448
Don't get excited.
I've got conditions.

162
00:18:04,288 --> 00:18:06,288
None of these.
It's too risky.

163
00:18:07,168 --> 00:18:10,609
Get caught with a rod,
and it's the slammer for life.

164
00:18:11,209 --> 00:18:14,209
Maybe I should go back
to my soap bubbles.

165
00:18:14,569 --> 00:18:16,089
Maybe you should.

166
00:18:16,249 --> 00:18:17,289
He in or what?

167
00:18:17,649 --> 00:18:22,250
For me, the rocks in the
window are chicken feed.

168
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:27,250
We gotta go for the real thing.
The jackpot. The safe!

169
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:32,650
Sure, it's gonna mean
careful preparation:

170
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:35,491
Knocking out their alarms,

171
00:18:35,651 --> 00:18:37,851
and, most of all,
getting a safecracker.

172
00:18:38,131 --> 00:18:39,651
Ever heard of Cesar the Milanese?

173
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:51,892
What's the wait for Milan,
please?

174
00:18:53,252 --> 00:18:55,652
For a job with you, he'll come.

175
00:18:56,812 --> 00:19:01,453
They say there's not a safe
that can resist Cesar,

176
00:19:01,813 --> 00:19:04,053
and not a woman that
Cesar can resist.

177
00:19:05,173 --> 00:19:06,853
How long?

178
00:19:07,293 --> 00:19:08,693
Right away.

179
00:19:09,693 --> 00:19:12,694
Get me 868-861.

180
00:19:16,254 --> 00:19:18,694
But first we make sure
we can fence the goods.

181
00:19:19,214 --> 00:19:21,734
I know just the guy:
Teddy the Levantine in London.

182
00:19:22,615 --> 00:19:23,575
I'm sure he'll go for it.

183
00:19:24,655 --> 00:19:27,295
You have a spare passport,
so you go see him.

184
00:19:28,215 --> 00:19:30,175
Book a flight the day before.

185
00:19:38,256 --> 00:19:40,216
I've got a great job.

186
00:19:41,216 --> 00:19:44,176
Right up your alley.

187
00:19:44,536 --> 00:19:46,697
With a friend. He's the best.

188
00:19:47,577 --> 00:19:49,537
Can you come?

189
00:19:50,497 --> 00:19:52,897
Great! I'll be at the airport.

190
00:19:56,577 --> 00:19:59,698
- Who lives upstairs?
- Webb himself. He's always home.

191
00:20:00,258 --> 00:20:04,578
Except weekends.
He goes hunting every Saturday.

192
00:20:05,138 --> 00:20:10,819
Jo, let's test your memory.
You name each store as we pass.

193
00:20:11,699 --> 00:20:13,659
Without looking up, OK?

194
00:20:14,779 --> 00:20:16,659
I can do it with my eyes shut.

195
00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:18,099
And Cesar?

196
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:31,820
"Ferrugia," pricey custom-made
boots for the missus.

197
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,540
- It opens when?
- Late.

198
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:38,141
"Tecla," cultured pearls,
costume junk. Opens at 10.

199
00:20:38,741 --> 00:20:41,301
Florist. Salesgirl has
the biggest boobs in town.

200
00:20:42,181 --> 00:20:45,581
Careful, it opens at 6 a.m.
Even earlier.

201
00:20:46,661 --> 00:20:48,742
So we gotta be out
no later than 5.

202
00:20:48,902 --> 00:20:49,862
That's for sure.

203
00:20:51,822 --> 00:20:55,462
"Henri Maupiou,"
silks for evening gowns.

204
00:20:55,782 --> 00:20:58,582
Branch stores in London and NY
for emergency repairs.

205
00:21:00,183 --> 00:21:01,183
Swell.

206
00:21:01,303 --> 00:21:03,823
- The other sidewalk now?
- No, I trust you.

207
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:06,823
We have to case it by night.
Things change then.

208
00:21:07,863 --> 00:21:09,183
Sure. Tonight?

209
00:21:10,183 --> 00:21:11,104
Tonight...

210
00:21:11,904 --> 00:21:16,104
I was at the "L'Age d'Or"
last night.

211
00:21:16,224 --> 00:21:17,584
You saw her?

212
00:21:17,744 --> 00:21:19,504
- I took her to my place.
- And Grutter?

213
00:21:20,304 --> 00:21:23,905
He wasn't in. He won't have
to look for me. I go back tonight.

214
00:21:24,185 --> 00:21:26,465
- You're nuts!
- Expect me to hide?

215
00:21:27,305 --> 00:21:29,185
Then I'm coming with you.

216
00:21:29,865 --> 00:21:33,185
No way. I don't need
my friends to settle this.

217
00:21:33,505 --> 00:21:34,585
Keep away.

218
00:21:36,186 --> 00:21:38,546
It's my business.
I'll handle this Grutter alone.

219
00:21:42,786 --> 00:21:43,746
Pierre, please!

220
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:50,267
I'm fed up with your big shot act.
You'll get yours some day.

221
00:21:50,467 --> 00:21:52,827
Take a look at yourself,
you little punk.

222
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:58,147
You're a pretty picture. Dope's
gonna land you in the nuthouse.

223
00:21:59,187 --> 00:22:00,668
Please!

224
00:22:02,868 --> 00:22:04,668
- Give me a little.
- Put that down.

225
00:22:14,189 --> 00:22:15,189
Just a bit.

226
00:22:23,109 --> 00:22:23,910
When I feel like it.

227
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:26,470
Got that?
We all just happened to be here.

228
00:22:43,151 --> 00:22:43,751
Hello, you.

229
00:22:44,311 --> 00:22:47,111
Hello, kid.
Sit your moneymaker down.

230
00:22:47,912 --> 00:22:48,912
Champagne.

231
00:22:49,512 --> 00:22:50,552
What's your tag?

232
00:22:52,472 --> 00:22:53,512
Maximilian.

233
00:23:06,633 --> 00:23:07,553
Viviane!

234
00:23:13,194 --> 00:23:18,234
<i>I got a guy who knows what's what
He ain't the kind to bust a gut</i>

235
00:23:18,714 --> 00:23:21,754
<i>He's got lotsa philosophy
Only he's too sweet on "rififi"</i>

236
00:23:24,275 --> 00:23:29,435
<i>If another guy just gives me a nod
Right away he goes for his rod</i>

237
00:23:29,795 --> 00:23:33,235
<i>He tips his hat and yessiree!
It's time for some "rififi"</i>

238
00:23:34,235 --> 00:23:39,156
<i>I step in, but he don't give a damn
He points me out and says: Scram!</i>

239
00:23:39,636 --> 00:23:42,836
<i>And when he's back after a while
He's got this nasty little smile</i>

240
00:23:43,196 --> 00:23:49,717
<i>And sure as sure can be
I'm next in line for "rififi"</i>

241
00:23:51,637 --> 00:23:56,557
<i>You look like
you don't have a clue</i>

242
00:23:56,917 --> 00:24:00,758
<i>Like no one ever spoke to you</i>

243
00:24:01,118 --> 00:24:03,518
<i>'Bout "rififi"</i>

244
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:10,438
<i>It's not a word that people use</i>

245
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:14,119

00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:17,199

247
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:27,840

248
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,680
<i>"Rififi"</i>

249
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:41,521
<i>So don't fry your brain and grumble
All it means is "rough n' tumble"</i>

250
00:24:41,761 --> 00:24:47,521
<i>"Rififi"</i>

251
00:24:48,442 --> 00:24:53,282
<i>When I'm done workin' the beat
He takes me to the movies as a treat</i>

252
00:24:53,882 --> 00:24:56,922
<i>He don't care what flick we see
So long as it's got "rififi"</i>

253
00:24:59,722 --> 00:25:04,643
<i>In love, he can be kinda rough
He don't go for sentimental stuff</i>

254
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:08,123
<i>A chick, he keeps telling me,
Gets her kicks on "rififi"</i>

255
00:25:09,483 --> 00:25:14,484
<i>And when he really lets himself go
I get a cuff just for the show</i>

256
00:25:14,884 --> 00:25:18,164
<i>And when I'm lying by his side
I'm nothing, I got no pride</i>

257
00:25:19,164 --> 00:25:23,284
<i>In paradise I wanna be
I'll pay the price in "rififi"</i>

Champagne, sir?

268
00:26:50,452 --> 00:26:52,852
- What are you doing here?
- What a surprise!

269
00:26:53,652 --> 00:26:56,172
That's perfect. This is Cesar...
The Stephanois.

270
00:26:58,612 --> 00:27:01,253
That's your Cesar?
You cut him out of a catalogue?

271
00:27:11,133 --> 00:27:12,613
He says you look like a tramp.

272
00:27:17,694 --> 00:27:18,614
Glad to meet you.

273
00:27:19,294 --> 00:27:20,454
Why'd you bring him here?

274
00:27:20,814 --> 00:27:24,734
He insisted. He says we should
stick together on everything.

275
00:27:25,135 --> 00:27:26,175
A Saint Bernard.

276
00:27:49,137 --> 00:27:51,537
So you quit the "RÃªve Bleu"?

277
00:27:51,697 --> 00:27:52,697
Three weeks ago.

278
00:27:53,257 --> 00:27:56,897
Mr Cesar... He's sorry
but he don't yack in French.

279
00:27:57,577 --> 00:27:59,897
But I understand everything.

280
00:28:48,621 --> 00:28:49,582
Don't recognize me?

281
00:28:50,502 --> 00:28:51,262
Should I?

282
00:28:51,942 --> 00:28:53,182
Tony the Stephanois.

283
00:28:56,182 --> 00:28:57,142
Nothing to say to me?

284
00:28:57,822 --> 00:29:01,783
I thought you were still doing
time. You're out, congrats.

285
00:29:01,943 --> 00:29:03,503
I know Mado was with you.

286
00:29:04,183 --> 00:29:06,863
But now she's with me. That's life.

287
00:29:07,943 --> 00:29:11,903
So don't try anything. You lay off
me and I'll lay off you.

288
00:29:12,543 --> 00:29:13,263
Okay?

289
00:29:20,144 --> 00:29:22,224
I don't believe it!
Mado didn't tell him.

290
00:29:23,264 --> 00:29:26,465
She didn't have to.
It's stamped across her back.

291
00:29:26,745 --> 00:29:28,625
Hey, Maximilian,
I'm running on empty.

292
00:29:28,945 --> 00:29:31,185
Then back to the garage.
By the way...

293
00:29:32,305 --> 00:29:34,145
- You know Mado?
- Sure, I do.

294
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:36,745
- Where is she?
- She's taking a trip.

295
00:29:37,185 --> 00:29:37,866
When was this?

296
00:29:38,266 --> 00:29:41,586
Last night. She took off,
then phoned Viviane later.

297
00:29:42,186 --> 00:29:43,626
- Is that all?
- That's all.

298
00:29:48,146 --> 00:29:49,787
Go play with boys your own age.

299
00:29:52,267 --> 00:29:55,427
- Well?
- Tell you later. What about Cesar?

300
00:30:08,788 --> 00:30:10,828
Thanks a lot!

301
00:30:11,188 --> 00:30:14,269
Don't cry. He just learned
some women have guts.

302
00:30:14,869 --> 00:30:20,949
<i>Proposition interesting. Certain can
handle in London. Teddy Levantine.</i>

303
00:30:54,912 --> 00:30:59,672
"Florist delivery.
5:50 a.m."

304
00:35:27,254 --> 00:35:28,775
- Ready?
- Just about.

305
00:35:32,735 --> 00:35:33,615
"Sure-Alarm."

306
00:35:35,935 --> 00:35:36,735
What's it say?

307
00:35:37,175 --> 00:35:39,936
It's no pushover.
It's the latest model.

308
00:35:41,296 --> 00:35:42,936
It's getting harder to make
a living.

309
00:35:44,416 --> 00:35:45,416
After you!

310
00:35:51,617 --> 00:35:52,617
Turn it on.

311
00:36:16,499 --> 00:36:19,859
"Severing any wire
causes a power cut

312
00:36:20,179 --> 00:36:22,619
"and activates the alarm system."

313
00:36:22,899 --> 00:36:24,539
Now we know.

314
00:36:27,219 --> 00:36:28,380
Hook it up.

315
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:32,940
Ready?

316
00:36:40,221 --> 00:36:42,741
The bastards thought of everything.

317
00:36:44,181 --> 00:36:46,421
They're clever, but
maybe not clever enough.

318
00:36:47,901 --> 00:36:48,901
Contact!

319
00:36:49,221 --> 00:36:50,261
You ain't seen nothin' yet.

320
00:36:58,822 --> 00:36:59,862
This little box...

321
00:37:01,262 --> 00:37:02,542
this is our deadly enemy.

322
00:37:03,542 --> 00:37:05,663
In every door, every window.

323
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:27,944
"Any vibration in a wall
or a floor

324
00:37:28,265 --> 00:37:30,705
"momentarily causes a power cut

325
00:37:30,865 --> 00:37:34,985
"which activates the alarm
by way of a relay system."

326
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:51,146
- Vibrations... And the floor?
- Depends on the touch.

327
00:38:25,509 --> 00:38:26,469
A little harder.

328
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:41,431
We have some leeway.

329
00:38:43,991 --> 00:38:45,191
Once more.

330
00:38:48,231 --> 00:38:50,911
- It's chancy.
- You'll have to go easy.

331
00:38:51,511 --> 00:38:53,792
The ceiling will take 2 hours,
at least.

332
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:56,912
And we can figure on
3 hours in the store, easy.

333
00:38:57,552 --> 00:39:01,752
But down there we can't even breathe
if we don't muzzle this thing.

334
00:39:01,992 --> 00:39:02,952
That's why we're here.

335
00:39:06,433 --> 00:39:07,513
Now let's see...

336
00:39:16,874 --> 00:39:17,874
That, too.

337
00:39:25,474 --> 00:39:28,915
The alarm system is
battery- and circuit-powered.

338
00:39:29,515 --> 00:39:31,515
If the battery runs down...

339
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:35,915
<i>Morning bells are ringing
Ding ding dong!</i>

340
00:40:07,638 --> 00:40:08,958
But when the box is shut...

341
00:40:10,598 --> 00:40:11,558
Through here?

342
00:40:11,718 --> 00:40:14,398
Why don't we just pour
in hot wax with a funnel?

343
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:19,519
Why not spaghetti?

344
00:40:19,999 --> 00:40:21,199
With parmesan.

345
00:40:55,642 --> 00:40:56,642
Out of the way!

346
00:41:16,203 --> 00:41:17,404
We're all set, guys!

347
01:13:14,442 --> 01:13:17,403
Excuse me, I heard singing.
Hello there!

348
01:13:19,443 --> 01:13:20,363
Who wants coffee?

349
01:13:21,123 --> 01:13:23,363
Nobody. Go back to bed, pet.

350
01:13:24,163 --> 01:13:25,163
You all right?

351
01:13:25,483 --> 01:13:28,164
In the pink.

352
01:13:30,524 --> 01:13:31,484
Run along now.

353
01:13:40,205 --> 01:13:41,205
So, Tony...

354
01:13:42,925 --> 01:13:47,685
Never in my whole crummy life...
200 million, at least.

355
01:13:48,445 --> 01:13:51,526
Even with the Levantine's take,
it was worth the risk.

356
01:13:54,446 --> 01:13:58,286
Now Ida and me can try out beds
in all the chic hotels.

357
01:13:59,486 --> 01:14:00,326
How about you?

358
01:14:01,326 --> 01:14:04,447
Four sisters.

359
01:14:05,367 --> 01:14:08,367
Nice girls.

360
01:14:09,407 --> 01:14:11,367
But no beauties.

361
01:14:14,247 --> 01:14:15,488
Gonna buy them husbands?

362
01:14:16,008 --> 01:14:17,168
Exactly.

363
01:14:22,368 --> 01:14:23,488
My kid.

364
01:14:27,489 --> 01:14:30,609
What about you?

365
01:14:32,049 --> 01:14:33,289
What do I want?

366
01:14:36,409 --> 01:14:37,489
Dunno.

367
01:14:40,410 --> 01:14:42,290
Let's not start spending it yet.

368
01:14:42,570 --> 01:14:45,450
There's still the fence to deal
with. Could be a hitch.

369
01:14:46,410 --> 01:14:49,930
And the cops will be hot
on our tails.

370
01:14:50,090 --> 01:14:51,490
We're not out of the woods yet.

371
01:14:52,371 --> 01:14:53,491
Still have your stash?

372
01:14:54,971 --> 01:14:56,931
Keep the goods here.

373
01:14:58,011 --> 01:15:00,971
Jo, your flight's in an hour.

374
01:15:01,451 --> 01:15:02,971
And you look grounded.

375
01:15:03,411 --> 01:15:06,372
I'll have Louise take care of you
while I'm away.

376
01:15:08,212 --> 01:15:11,892
You sleep here at Mario's.
No hotel registers.

377
01:15:12,252 --> 01:15:14,972
And no runnin' around Montmartre.

378
01:15:23,093 --> 01:15:24,493
Heard what I told your paisano?

379
01:15:26,413 --> 01:15:27,373
No problem.

380
01:15:33,374 --> 01:15:37,934
Read all about it! 240 million!
Biggest take since the Sabine women!

381
01:15:48,335 --> 01:15:50,135
London on the line. Booth 3.

382
01:15:59,456 --> 01:16:00,896
How's it going?

383
01:16:01,216 --> 01:16:02,456
He drives a hard bargain.

384
01:16:03,536 --> 01:16:06,457
But we've clinched it.
I'll be home tomorrow.

385
01:16:06,977 --> 01:16:11,257
Great. Listen, remember that
rubber clown Jimmy got in London?

386
01:16:12,057 --> 01:16:13,737
Yeah, the one that bounces back.

387
01:16:14,497 --> 01:16:17,258
Get me one for your kid.
He'll go for that.

388
01:16:17,498 --> 01:16:18,418
Sure thing.

389
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:44,700
It's beautiful.

390
01:16:46,980 --> 01:16:48,420
You're sweet.

391
01:16:52,381 --> 01:16:56,541
I can tell you since you don't
understand: I know it's a fake.

392
01:17:03,461 --> 01:17:07,382
Mado! Where you been?
Pierre sent RÃ©mi out to find you.

393
01:17:07,702 --> 01:17:10,502
I'll explain later.
Please don't tell him I'm here.

394
01:17:11,382 --> 01:17:13,182
As you like.

395
01:17:22,583 --> 01:17:24,503
I understand.
Goodnight, Inspector.

396
01:17:32,104 --> 01:17:32,984
What'd he want?

397
01:17:33,384 --> 01:17:35,464
They're offering 10 million
for a lead on the jewelry job.

398
01:17:36,944 --> 01:17:39,384
- Meaning they're in the dark.
- It's our play.

399
01:17:40,144 --> 01:17:42,185
You've got a visitor.

400
01:18:02,146 --> 01:18:03,186
Hello there.

401
01:18:17,188 --> 01:18:18,268
So, your trip...

402
01:18:20,308 --> 01:18:21,228
Let's hear it.

403
01:18:21,388 --> 01:18:22,508
Hello, Pierre.

404
01:18:28,989 --> 01:18:29,669
Did you trip?

405
01:18:33,269 --> 01:18:35,949
And how'd you get this?

406
01:18:37,309 --> 01:18:39,349
Answer me. Who did it?

407
01:18:45,510 --> 01:18:47,950
I can't stay with you.

408
01:18:51,990 --> 01:18:53,031
You can't hold me.

409
01:18:56,231 --> 01:18:57,151
You can't.

410
01:19:13,552 --> 01:19:15,672
I suppose you don't know
the Stephanois is back.

411
01:20:18,078 --> 01:20:19,038
One...

412
01:20:20,278 --> 01:20:21,318
Two...

413
01:20:29,038 --> 01:20:34,319
I want you to take out
the Stephanois. He's in my way.

414
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:44,680
- He don't weigh much.
- Go on, RÃ©mi.

415
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:51,480
Hold on a sec!
Close the door.

416
01:20:54,201 --> 01:20:55,161
Look at this!

417
01:20:58,161 --> 01:21:00,361
Nice ring.
Where'd you get it?

418
01:21:01,081 --> 01:21:03,961
Some crazy little Italian
gave it to Viviane.

419
01:21:04,361 --> 01:21:06,402
All this fuss over some cheap stone!

420
01:21:09,362 --> 01:21:11,642
- How'd you meet him?
- Through his pal Mario.

421
01:21:11,962 --> 01:21:12,922
Which Mario?

422
01:21:13,082 --> 01:21:16,402
Some hood. You must know him.
Remember, Ida's man...

423
01:21:17,202 --> 01:21:18,683
Ex-"RÃªve bleu" dancer!

424
01:21:19,723 --> 01:21:23,323
Mario Ferrati.
He works with the Stephanois.

425
01:21:29,523 --> 01:21:33,004
I'm on in 5 minutes and
my Italian's waiting backstage.

426
01:21:33,204 --> 01:21:34,524
He can wait. You stay put.

427
01:21:38,164 --> 01:21:39,724
- Let's go.
- My ring!

428
01:21:42,125 --> 01:21:43,365
Relax. It's a fake.

429
01:21:47,165 --> 01:21:48,685
- A fake worth a million.
- No kidding!

430
01:21:49,285 --> 01:21:52,285
This changes everything.
We need Tony alive now.

431
01:21:53,085 --> 01:21:57,326
It adds up. The Italian's got the
hots for Viviane. He's Mario's pal.

432
01:21:57,966 --> 01:22:02,926
Mario's in with Tony, who's just
done a stretch... for a jewel heist!

433
01:22:03,366 --> 01:22:07,767
This morning, the Webb
job... and now this!

434
01:22:08,367 --> 01:22:10,407
It adds up, I tell you.

435
01:22:11,367 --> 01:22:13,407
It's like being brought
10 million on a platter.

436
01:22:14,007 --> 01:22:17,047
What did the papers say?
240 million, no?

437
01:22:18,368 --> 01:22:19,408
Let's go get it.

438
01:22:20,368 --> 01:22:21,368
What are you gonna do?

439
01:22:23,408 --> 01:22:25,128
Practice my Italian.

440
01:22:59,211 --> 01:23:00,531
No, this way, Spaghetti!

441
01:23:21,133 --> 01:23:22,453
This comes from Webb's?

442
01:23:57,536 --> 01:24:00,096
Not a sound. Or else...

443
01:24:04,096 --> 01:24:06,096
The ice, and fast!

444
01:24:07,977 --> 01:24:08,777
What ice...

445
01:24:13,337 --> 01:24:17,337
No games! I know
you've got it stashed here.

446
01:24:19,578 --> 01:24:21,378
I don't know what
you're talking about.

447
01:24:23,458 --> 01:24:24,338
You don't?

448
01:24:26,418 --> 01:24:28,378
Your pal Cesar thinks you do.

449
01:24:30,098 --> 01:24:34,299
What's he got to do with this?

450
01:24:35,419 --> 01:24:37,939
So, don't know where they are?

451
01:24:40,739 --> 01:24:41,699
In that case...

452
01:24:48,380 --> 01:24:49,420
The Stephanois...

453
01:24:52,180 --> 01:24:53,180
Maybe he knows.

454
01:24:54,220 --> 01:24:57,421
The Stephanois?
Who's he?

455
01:25:00,381 --> 01:25:01,421
Call him.

456
01:25:02,981 --> 01:25:04,141
Get him here.

457
01:25:09,702 --> 01:25:11,182
I forgot his number.

458
01:25:12,742 --> 01:25:14,102
Hurry up, creep!

459
01:25:18,743 --> 01:25:20,303
Is it coming back to you now?

460
01:25:23,383 --> 01:25:25,383
- No.
- My turn!

461
01:25:28,263 --> 01:25:29,343
I'll call him.

462
01:25:31,424 --> 01:25:32,984
Ida, don't!

463
01:25:35,384 --> 01:25:39,224
They'll kill him!
You know Tony, he'll never talk!

464
01:25:40,064 --> 01:25:43,345
They'll kill him! Don't do it!

465
01:25:45,065 --> 01:25:47,465
Please, Ida, don't!

466
01:25:48,345 --> 01:25:52,345
It's me, Ida.

467
01:25:53,305 --> 01:25:54,986
You gotta get over here now...

468
01:26:05,146 --> 01:26:08,347
Don't come, Tony! The Grutters
are here for the rocks!

469
01:26:14,347 --> 01:26:16,387
You idiot!
Let's get the hell out!

470
01:27:13,712 --> 01:27:15,232
- How'd you find me?
- Skip it.

471
01:27:15,352 --> 01:27:17,072
- I don't want to see you.
- I figured.

472
01:27:18,712 --> 01:27:20,513
Just tell me where
I can find Grutter.

473
01:27:22,313 --> 01:27:25,393
Look, Mado, I know
you left Grutter.

474
01:27:26,113 --> 01:27:28,153
I also know you didn't tell him
about that night.

475
01:27:29,153 --> 01:27:32,434
Maybe we can wipe the slate clean.

476
01:27:32,794 --> 01:27:33,674
Never!

477
01:27:37,154 --> 01:27:41,234
I want Grutter.
He murdered my friends.

478
01:27:41,474 --> 01:27:45,075
So what!
You'll all die, one by one!

479
01:27:45,355 --> 01:27:46,955
The whole rotten bunch of you!

480
01:27:48,355 --> 01:27:49,275
I get it.

481
01:27:51,395 --> 01:27:52,355
Goodbye, Mado.

482
01:29:31,563 --> 01:29:32,684
Grutter!

483
01:30:01,006 --> 01:30:01,686
You alone?

484
01:30:15,407 --> 01:30:16,327
How's Mario?

485
01:30:18,087 --> 01:30:19,087
Not now.

486
01:30:19,407 --> 01:30:20,448
Please, tell me.

487
01:30:22,208 --> 01:30:23,248
How's Mario?

488
01:30:26,168 --> 01:30:27,168
He's dead.

489
01:30:31,128 --> 01:30:32,168
Forgive me.

490
01:30:35,369 --> 01:30:36,329
It was you.

491
01:30:39,289 --> 01:30:40,329
You ratted on him.

492
01:30:42,249 --> 01:30:43,249
Forgive me.

493
01:30:44,450 --> 01:30:45,410
I was afraid.

494
01:30:49,370 --> 01:30:53,090
I liked you.
I really liked you, Macaroni.

495
01:30:57,491 --> 01:30:58,451
But you know the rules.

496
01:31:05,451 --> 01:31:06,651
The rules.

497
01:31:29,293 --> 01:31:30,773
Police?

498
01:31:32,694 --> 01:31:36,014
You'll find two bodies
at 40, rue Fontaine du But.

499
01:31:38,134 --> 01:31:39,494
At Mario Ferrati's.

500
01:32:08,776 --> 01:32:10,017
Hello, Inspector.

501
01:32:11,457 --> 01:32:15,657
Can I ask why you're attending
Mario Ferrati's funeral?

502
01:32:16,017 --> 01:32:17,177
Just an idea.

503
01:32:17,457 --> 01:32:22,298
With all these police, is there
a hood crazy enough to show up?

504
01:32:22,458 --> 01:32:23,458
I doubt it.

505
01:32:24,138 --> 01:32:25,258
There's the procession.

506
01:32:28,138 --> 01:32:30,378
Flowers. Without cards or names.

507
01:32:31,258 --> 01:32:34,779
Not a soul behind the hearse.
I came as a matter of form.

508
01:33:45,705 --> 01:33:47,305
Freeze, for the kid's sake!

509
01:33:55,385 --> 01:33:58,026
Hold your balloon tight.
See what can happen to it?

510
01:34:05,506 --> 01:34:06,426
Is that clear?

511
01:34:08,826 --> 01:34:12,707
Tell Jo, the kid or the gems,
and to wait for our call.

512
01:34:14,267 --> 01:34:16,267
And not a word to the cops.

513
01:34:25,748 --> 01:34:26,668
Mommy's not coming?

514
01:34:28,108 --> 01:34:29,108
Later.

515
01:34:51,230 --> 01:34:53,790
So, tough guys,
is this war games?

516
01:34:57,150 --> 01:34:58,511
Where's my baby, you thug?

517
01:35:00,431 --> 01:35:01,471
Where's my baby?

518
01:35:06,191 --> 01:35:10,632
Let me call the police.
They'll do something. Please, Jo!

519
01:35:12,232 --> 01:35:14,432
- You gotta keep calm!
- Let me call, Jo.

520
01:35:15,312 --> 01:35:18,192
You know if you call the cops
I can't make a move.

521
01:35:19,432 --> 01:35:21,192
Have patience, honey.

522
01:35:23,153 --> 01:35:25,113
They'll call soon.

523
01:35:34,194 --> 01:35:35,074
This way.

524
01:35:35,194 --> 01:35:36,474
- How's it going, Tony?
- In here.

525
01:35:55,275 --> 01:35:56,195
It's all there.

526
01:35:57,035 --> 01:35:58,316
120 million, as agreed.

527
01:35:59,436 --> 01:36:01,156
Amusing.

528
01:36:02,036 --> 01:36:03,796
Your work's done.
Ours is just starting.

529
01:36:04,436 --> 01:36:07,316
The rocks have to be recut.
I'll take a loss.

530
01:36:09,516 --> 01:36:10,757
But that's how the trade goes.

531
01:36:14,197 --> 01:36:15,117
Cute.

532
01:36:19,757 --> 01:36:21,117
I'll be running along.

533
01:36:39,479 --> 01:36:42,039
I'll turn this town inside out,
but I'll find them.

534
01:36:43,399 --> 01:36:45,719
Stay here.
I'll call in every 20 minutes.

535
01:36:46,240 --> 01:36:49,800
If they call,
I'll have to give it to them.

536
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:55,400
Out of the question!

537
01:37:01,441 --> 01:37:03,201
I meant my share.

538
01:37:03,441 --> 01:37:05,081
Not your share, not anyone's!

539
01:37:05,761 --> 01:37:07,481
It's mine!

540
01:37:08,041 --> 01:37:11,642
Don't be a fool! They won't
give you the kid in exchange.

541
01:37:11,802 --> 01:37:16,722
The longer they wait, the better
the kid's chances. They'll kill him!

542
01:37:17,682 --> 01:37:22,483
- A kid's a witness. He remembers.
- He's only 5!

543
01:37:22,803 --> 01:37:25,803
At five, you've got eyes and ears.
And a tongue.

544
01:37:27,283 --> 01:37:28,283
No, take my word for it.

545
01:37:30,323 --> 01:37:33,323
The only chance of getting
the boy back... is this.

546
01:37:35,404 --> 01:37:36,364
The only chance.

547
01:37:39,204 --> 01:37:40,364
You may be right.

548
01:37:42,764 --> 01:37:47,165
Look after Louise. It's rough on
her. I'll send Fredo's wife over.

549
01:38:01,686 --> 01:38:02,486
See you tomorrow.

550
01:38:07,126 --> 01:38:08,406
The bastards!

551
01:38:09,446 --> 01:38:11,367
This kind of thing
doesn't happen here.

552
01:38:14,167 --> 01:38:16,367
Just say the word and
all the guys are behind you.

553
01:38:17,727 --> 01:38:19,687
We can't risk letting the cops
get wind of this.

554
01:38:21,167 --> 01:38:22,607
So what'll you do?

555
01:38:22,768 --> 01:38:24,728
I'll do the rounds of friends
I can count on.

556
01:38:25,488 --> 01:38:28,328
If they hear anything, they'll
call here. I'll keep in touch.

557
01:38:29,248 --> 01:38:30,208
Okay.

558
01:39:45,774 --> 01:39:49,615
Why look at me like that?
He's my kid, too! Why blame me?

559
01:39:53,135 --> 01:39:54,255
I'm not blaming you.

560
01:39:56,095 --> 01:39:58,375
There's something
I always wanted to tell you.

561
01:40:01,256 --> 01:40:02,376
There are kids...

562
01:40:03,256 --> 01:40:06,256
Millions of kids who've
grown up poor. Like you.

563
01:40:07,656 --> 01:40:09,136
How did it happen...

564
01:40:10,136 --> 01:40:12,417
What difference was there
between them and you,

565
01:40:13,497 --> 01:40:17,297
that you became a hood,
a tough guy,

566
01:40:18,457 --> 01:40:19,737
and not them?

567
01:40:21,137 --> 01:40:25,258
Know what I think, Jo?
They're the tough guys, not you.

568
01:40:33,338 --> 01:40:34,778
No, Tony. Still nothing.

569
01:40:42,059 --> 01:40:43,019
Nothing?

570
01:40:44,339 --> 01:40:45,379
How's Jo?

571
01:40:46,219 --> 01:40:47,179
He's thrilled.

572
01:41:04,181 --> 01:41:08,341
Fredo told me about the kid. It's
disgusting. If I can be of help...

573
01:41:08,821 --> 01:41:11,822
Thanks. Tell me where
Grutter and his boys hide out.

574
01:41:13,062 --> 01:41:16,382
I think I know. He's building a villa
near Saint-RÃ©my-lÃ¨s-Chevreuse.

575
01:41:17,222 --> 01:41:20,342
A guy goes out there all the time:
Charlie, the dope dealer.

576
01:41:20,702 --> 01:41:21,622
Know where to find him?

577
01:41:25,303 --> 01:41:26,263
Let's go.

578
01:41:38,344 --> 01:41:40,304
The kid's OK.
Got the ice?

579
01:41:43,224 --> 01:41:46,624
The fence has them.
He's bringing the dough.

580
01:41:47,024 --> 01:41:49,185
- When?
- Any minute now.

581
01:41:49,385 --> 01:41:52,385
I'll call one more time.
It'll be the last.

582
01:42:25,468 --> 01:42:27,108
- In the cleaner's...
- I'll go.

583
01:42:27,268 --> 01:42:30,628
No, let me. The guy knows me.
Have any money?

584
01:43:06,311 --> 01:43:08,791
I'm close.

585
01:43:09,151 --> 01:43:10,591
Pierre just called.

586
01:43:10,791 --> 01:43:12,392
I told him the money's
coming, to wait,

587
01:43:12,632 --> 01:43:14,352
but the bastard means business.

588
01:43:15,312 --> 01:43:16,832
I can't take any more!

589
01:43:17,432 --> 01:43:20,432
This is no time to lose your
head. We'll get 'em.

590
01:43:21,072 --> 01:43:22,832
But the kid, Tony!

591
01:43:23,472 --> 01:43:27,433
Just hold on, Jo! I'll call you
back in a few minutes.

592
01:43:28,113 --> 01:43:29,353
I'll be waiting.

593
01:43:42,434 --> 01:43:43,394
I want to see Charlie.

594
01:43:43,794 --> 01:43:46,834
But I don't know if he...

595
01:43:47,314 --> 01:43:48,835
If it isn't Mado! Come on in.

596
01:43:53,035 --> 01:43:53,675
How's Pierre?

597
01:43:53,835 --> 01:43:55,035
Fine, fine.

598
01:43:56,275 --> 01:43:58,235
- Coffee?
- No, I haven't got time.

599
01:43:58,395 --> 01:44:02,156
It's for RÃ©mi.
He's crying for more dope.

600
01:44:02,396 --> 01:44:04,396
You have to take him
some at the villa.

601
01:44:05,396 --> 01:44:06,756
Oh, him!

602
01:44:08,316 --> 01:44:09,436
Just when my car breaks down.

603
01:44:10,756 --> 01:44:13,397
I'd have to take the Metro.
It's pretty far.

604
01:44:16,757 --> 01:44:17,717
You go.

605
01:44:18,357 --> 01:44:19,717
I can't. Pierre's waiting.

606
01:44:20,157 --> 01:44:22,117
- Why is it always me?
- Be nice.

607
01:44:23,477 --> 01:44:24,317
What about my car?

608
01:44:25,158 --> 01:44:26,318
He's a good customer.

609
01:44:27,358 --> 01:44:28,318
I'll go.

610
01:44:31,638 --> 01:44:33,758
- And quick.
- Where's the fire?

611
01:45:31,123 --> 01:45:32,283
Can I use your phone?

612
01:45:32,483 --> 01:45:34,243
Sorry, pal. It's an inside line.

613
01:46:31,048 --> 01:46:33,208
- What're you doing here?
- I have RÃ©mi's stuff.

614
01:46:33,368 --> 01:46:35,448
Pierre sent you?

615
01:46:35,648 --> 01:46:36,648
No, Mado.

616
01:46:37,809 --> 01:46:40,769
- What's so odd about that?
- Nothing.

617
01:46:41,089 --> 01:46:42,209
Mado paid already.

618
01:46:42,849 --> 01:46:44,809
Okay then. So long.

619
01:47:41,294 --> 01:47:42,294
Uncle Tony!

620
01:47:47,374 --> 01:47:48,734
Isn't it a funny-Iooking house?

621
01:47:49,815 --> 01:47:52,815
- Mommy's not here?
- We're going to meet her.

622
01:47:54,335 --> 01:47:56,215
Go and get into the nice car.

623
01:47:57,055 --> 01:47:58,455
Aren't you coming, Uncle?

624
01:47:58,855 --> 01:48:01,295
Sure, I am. If you're a good boy
I'll let you drive.

625
01:48:18,297 --> 01:48:19,417
On your feet, punk.

626
01:48:22,297 --> 01:48:24,057
Wake up, you bastard.

627
01:48:25,417 --> 01:48:27,578
I don't want you to miss anything.

628
01:48:42,699 --> 01:48:45,219
Come on, Uncle Tony! All aboard!

629
01:48:48,739 --> 01:48:50,740
Let me drive, Uncle Tony!

630
01:48:51,100 --> 01:48:52,100
Later.

631
01:49:01,420 --> 01:49:05,701
No, don't hang up!
The money just arrived.

632
01:49:06,101 --> 01:49:08,141
You know
Saint-RÃ©my-lÃ¨s-Chevreuse?

633
01:49:08,661 --> 01:49:10,621
It's about 200 yards from
the station.

634
01:49:11,341 --> 01:49:14,662
Take a left until you reach
a house under construction.

635
01:49:15,222 --> 01:49:17,382
You can't miss it.
I'll give you 40 minutes.

636
01:49:18,142 --> 01:49:21,142
Make sure you're alone,
and unarmed.

637
01:49:37,303 --> 01:49:38,184
What is it, Jo?

638
01:49:59,425 --> 01:50:02,185
- I need to call.
- The phone's there.

639
01:50:02,346 --> 01:50:03,866
I'm hungry, Uncle Tony.

640
01:50:04,186 --> 01:50:05,786
Wait until we get home.
I'm calling Mommy.

641
01:50:22,187 --> 01:50:23,147
Say hello to Daddy.

642
01:50:25,067 --> 01:50:28,388
I'm okay. Did Daddy go out?

643
01:50:29,788 --> 01:50:34,108
Where's Jo? Sure, I have Tonio.
Where's Jo, goddamit?

644
01:50:34,268 --> 01:50:37,788
I don't know. Someone called.
He ran out with a suitcase.

645
01:50:43,829 --> 01:50:47,269
- Can you make the boy a sandwich?
- Of course, sir.

646
01:50:47,829 --> 01:50:50,189
- Where are you going?
- I'll be right back.

647
01:50:50,349 --> 01:50:52,350
I leave him in your care.

648
01:50:52,510 --> 01:50:53,750
Go right ahead.

649
01:50:54,430 --> 01:50:56,150
So what'll you'll have, little man?

650
01:50:56,390 --> 01:50:58,150
A big, big, big sandwich.

651
01:51:09,431 --> 01:51:10,391
Louis...

652
01:51:11,311 --> 01:51:12,671
What happened?

653
01:51:14,151 --> 01:51:15,232
The Stephanois...

654
01:51:42,674 --> 01:51:44,874
What's your worry?
You have the kid.

655
01:51:45,354 --> 01:51:46,874
- Got it all?
- Come here.

656
01:51:47,754 --> 01:51:48,594
Let's have it.

657
01:51:50,434 --> 01:51:51,595
The kid first.

658
01:51:51,835 --> 01:51:53,395
Okay. Come in.

659
01:51:59,315 --> 01:52:00,275
Come on up.

660
01:52:11,916 --> 01:52:12,756
Where's the kid?

661
01:52:12,876 --> 01:52:15,357
The Stephanois pulled a fast one.
He took him.

662
01:54:37,888 --> 01:54:40,289
Your change!

663
01:54:49,369 --> 01:54:51,409
I'm cold, Uncle Tony!

664
01:54:52,170 --> 01:54:53,290
Put this coat on.

665
01:54:57,810 --> 01:54:59,850
Look at those trees!
