1
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:24,314
The restoration of Roma (1972)
was created from the 35mm version

2
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:26,608
held by Titanus
at the Cineteca di Bologna.

3
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:28,902
In 1972, after the first screening
ofthe film in Rome,

4
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,488
Fellini, along with the producer
and screenwriter Bernardino Zapponi,

5
00:00:31,614 --> 00:00:33,991
decided to shorten some sequences
for the international market.

6
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:36,452
Only traces remain of these shots
in the production documentation

7
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:38,912
and the Deposito Legale's
positive print version,

8
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,748
stored at the
CSC - National Film Archive.

9
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,791
This copy is the version
for the international market.

10
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:44,376
The restoration was carried out

11
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:46,003
at the Immagine Ritrovata lab,
Bologna, in 2010.

12
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,732
- He's written from America.
- What does he say?

13
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,943
They eat everything
out of cans over there.

14
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:18,238
The first image of Rome
was a centuries-old stone

15
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:22,993
rising out ofthe field
just outside my hometown.

16
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:33,545
Later on, at school, we were told
other interesting things about Rome.

17
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:40,093
This is the Rubicon...

18
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:46,767
the river Julius Caesar crossed,
sayin'g, ''Alea iacta est!''

19
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,312
- Take offyour shoes, children.
- Take offyour shoes

20
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:52,856
and we'll cross the river together.

21
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,653
Alea iacta est!

22
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,616
- To Rome.
- To Rome!

23
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:31,061
The fascist shit, his head is split -
half a head, they say

24
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:34,314
Crossed the Rubicon one day
and lost his balls along the way

25
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,907
Now we've got another meanie
by the name of Mussolini

26
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:46,576
Julius Caesar took a chance
and led his army into France

27
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:49,579
in those days, the French were Gauls
and Caesar a man with balls

28
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:56,753
Bring me then Metellus Cimbers'
petition and I shall examine it.

29
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:59,798
And now, hands, speak for me.

30
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,677
You too, Brutus?

31
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,350
My son.

32
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:44,343
Julius Caesar.

33
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:57,147
Sir, if I may say so,
last night you had us all in tears.

34
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:58,690
It was a truly artistic performance.

35
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:03,487
Eternal gratitude
to our humble web-footed friends.

36
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:12,621
To our humble web-footed friends
with their excited quacking.

37
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:16,291
It's always that one, sir.
Always the same one.

38
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:25,133
Woke the soldiers who picked up
their weapons and saved Rome.

39
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,888
And you can hear their descendants
quacking right outside the window.

40
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:33,767
Careful, now. Careful.

41
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:36,269
Return to your seats.

42
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:42,818
I won't tolerate any disorder.
Stop it.

43
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:46,613
You are not out in the streets now.
You're in school!

44
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:50,992
Barbetti! Stacchiotti! Ballazzi!
I'll beat you to death, by God!

45
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:54,454
...in saecula saeculorum, amen.
On your feet.

46
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:57,582
Rings.

47
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,794
Napkins.

48
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,712
Dismissed.

49
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:09,177
Silence. Order.

50
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,140
Order and silence.

51
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,524
The bronze she-wolf
at the Capitol.

52
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:31,616
Santa Maria Maggiore,
one ofthe four Roman basilicas.

53
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:39,374
The tomb of Cecilia Metella
on the Appia Antica.

54
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,171
The Arch of Constantine.

55
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:46,756
The altar ofthe fatherland.

56
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:55,640
St Peter's,
Holy Mother Church's greatest temple.

57
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:04,274
Turn it off!
Turn on the lights, somebody!

58
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,859
The lights!

59
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:10,405
Don't look, children.
Close your eyes. It's the devil.

60
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:15,410
Whoever looks will go to hell.
Keep your eyes closed.

61
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:19,456
- It's the devil! The devil!
- Good Lord! On your feet!

62
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:36,389
But church bells
are the voice of God.

63
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,350
We should turn
on the radio, signora.

64
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:41,895
- There's a blessing from the Pope.
- Just bring the soup here, you idiot!

65
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,523
- Stay where you are!
- But, Severino, it's a papal blessing.

66
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:47,108
So put it on the salad!

67
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:50,111
- Shame on you. You'll go to hell.
- Stay where you are.

68
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:54,491
On your knees. Don't pay attention
to your good-for-nothing father.

69
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:00,664
Drop dead, you old bat!

70
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:22,435
For heaven's sake, folks, there's
no need to push. We've got enough seats.

71
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,729
Three adults, two children
and one maid. What?

72
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:29,484
Full price for a maid?
Well, I'll be damned.

73
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,778
Shut up!
Adele, keep an eye on that kid.

74
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,446
Carmela, the baby!

75
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:37,158
Hang on to my coat and follow me.
Excuse me. Pardon me.

76
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:40,203
Besides, there's three shows today.
Come back later.

77
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,710
May the gods smile upon you,
Pompeo.

78
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:50,255
I have come
to bid you farewell.

79
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:53,425
With what adventures,
Priscilla the Christian?

80
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:58,888
I have a generous nature.
But vengeance is a temptress.

81
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:02,058
- Be on your guard, both ofyou.
- And yet, i love her.

82
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:11,359
No, no, have mercy!

83
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:13,403
I beg you, mercy!
Let me go!

84
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:21,703
There are some seats. Hurry! Adele!
Leonina! You sit over there.

85
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:25,707
- My wife's purse was on that seat.
- Purses don't count.

86
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:33,900
Carmela, the baby!

87
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:38,279
Sir, you are an ill-mannered boor,
that's what you are.

88
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:42,909
And you don't seem to realise who I am.
I'm the school principal, that's who.

89
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:47,455
The principal, understand?

90
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:53,169
Rome: the parade of October 28
was in an atmosphere of enthusiasm.

91
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:56,548
The entire city was there to greet
our leader and proclaim its faith

92
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,967
in the glorious and indomitable
destiny ofthe imperial fatherland.

93
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:03,263
His Excellency S. De Carolis
took part in the jump through the hoop.

94
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,265
What a man.

95
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:09,144
Sons ofthe she-wolf
flocked to the beaches of Rome

96
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:14,107
where Italians and their automobiles
paraded to the songs ofthe revolution

97
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:17,986
followed by a box lunch which included
bread, famous national cheeses

98
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:20,280
and piping red tea.

99
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:22,866
Florence.

100
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,326
The magnificent stone walls
ofthe Pitti Palace

101
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:28,329
seem to smile
beneath the warm spring sunshine.

102
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,670
This lady was the wife
ofthe local chemist.

103
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:38,590
Everyone said
she was worse than Messalina.

104
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:18,713
And no need to play with yourself.
That's what's nice about Rome.

105
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,174
It's big and nobody knows you.
You are free to come and go.

106
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,260
What about the Roman women?
What are they like?

107
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:27,847
The Roman women?
They've got an ass as wide as that.

108
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,424
Quit fucking around
and get out of my way.

109
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,885
Don't worry. I'm going.

110
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,805
Get your lottery tickets here.

111
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:28,551
- Hey there, need a lighter?
- No, thanks. I've already got one.

112
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:31,888
I'll give you, as a present,
a bolt offirst-class English wool.

113
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,015
- Got a place to sleep tonight?
- In via Albalonga.

114
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:36,935
I have a room with your own entrance
and a cute little French girl.

115
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,686
No.

116
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:44,651
Hotel Dragoni.
Hotel Dragoni!

117
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:48,297
veal at eight lire a kilo.
What's this world coming to?

118
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:50,383
There's only two things
you can be sure of.

119
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,760
That's right.
Death and taxes.

120
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:09,110
- I'm looking for the Palletta family.
- Fourth floor.

121
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:11,738
The elevator's broken.

122
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,241
David, I'm going to beat
the hell out ofyou.

123
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:18,953
There, stupid!

124
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,872
You always do it wrong.

125
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,837
Where can I find
the Palletta family?

126
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,425
Thank you.

127
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:37,263
He says to me, ''Are you kidding me,
or are you really stupid?''

128
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:38,806
''What do you mean?''

129
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:42,560
And he says, ''Come on. You must
be kidding.'' I say, ''What do you mean?''

130
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:45,271
- So?
- What do you mean, so?

131
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:50,359
The solemn military and religious rites
at the tomb ofthe unknown...

132
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:54,155
I'm gonna throw the cat
out the window!

133
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,907
His Excellency
Count Racobelli attended

134
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:59,994
and Mons. Troisi Ragusa was there
to represent the Holy Sea.

135
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,915
Hey! Listen.

136
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:07,502
Ciao. Is your mother home?

137
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,342
Hello?

138
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:16,302
Anybody home?

139
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:19,472
Signora?

140
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:23,726
Antonietta! I did it!

141
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:26,020
Stay there a minute.
I'm coming.

142
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:30,483
- There's someone at the door.
- I did it! I did it!

143
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,693
Signora,
that young man is here,

144
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,946
the one whose mother wrote you
from up north.

145
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,697
Shall I let him in?

146
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:44,413
- How do you do?
- I was making pasta. Let me help you.

147
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,582
- Come in. Come in, please.
- Thanks.

148
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,459
Make yourself at home.

149
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:52,421
The signora's not feeling very well.
Come on. This way.

150
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,298
One of her ovaries is inflamed.

151
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:59,053
We'll just set it down here, all right?
Come on. I'll show you the house.

152
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:03,641
Come in, come in.

153
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:07,728
I hope you don't mind children,
because there's a lot ofthem living here.

154
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:12,525
This is the dining room.
Florentine furniture. Nice, eh?

155
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,402
- That's the signora's eldest son.
- Who is it?

156
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:17,196
He's going to work as a clerk.

157
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:20,366
- Why did you have to go to the beach?
- How do you do?

158
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:24,579
- Why shouldn't I have gone?
- Did you have to go at noon?

159
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:25,788
When, then?

160
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:27,498
My poor baby.

161
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:33,462
A bad sunburn, eh?
Do you have a fever?

162
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,382
I think so, yeah.

163
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:40,094
- Nice shirt you've got there.
- Thank you.

164
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:50,521
Are you afraid of Chinamen? He is one
and he's even got kitchen privileges.

165
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:55,818
My God, it stinks in here. Why don't
you open the window when you cook?

166
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:03,326
Bucatini matriciana sauce.
Have some?

167
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,453
- No, thank you.
- very good. Delicious.

168
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:08,372
Let me out of here
before I throw up.

169
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:11,834
Bucatini matriciana.
Yeah, for pigs.

170
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,798
Signora,
shall I show him the kitchen?

171
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:20,801
Yes, honey,
show him the kitchen.

172
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:25,681
Oh, my God! What have I done
to deserve such suffering?

173
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:27,183
The kitchen's this way.

174
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:30,228
- After you.
- No, please, after you.

175
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:35,191
Antonietta, I did it!

176
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,401
I did it! I did it!

177
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:39,737
All right, so you did it.
You don't have to broadcast it.

178
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:41,906
Just a moment.

179
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,161
- Ciao.
- Good afternoon.

180
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:49,580
- What did you bring me?
- Nothing, yet. What do you want?

181
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:56,087
How about you?
Do you think there'll be a war?

182
00:20:56,213 --> 00:21:00,299
- Want to see the little granny?
- Sure. That's why I came.

183
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,468
Follow me.

184
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:05,054
She's littler than us kids.

185
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,893
Little granny!
Look who's here!

186
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:16,941
- Bless you.
- Thank you, and same to you.

187
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:20,069
Bet your granny's not that little.
Bet your granny's not that little.

188
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:25,366
- What's this?
- This is my room.

189
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,493
I haven't tidied up yet.

190
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:30,705
- It's nice and sunny.
- Will you put down those scissors!

191
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:33,958
Good afternoon.
Landi is the name. Marco Landi.

192
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,876
- Remember me?
- I think so.

193
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:39,505
I made my debut with Camerini
and I worked a lot with Gennaro Righelli.

194
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,716
I play the part ofthe bon vivant.

195
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:44,760
- I was the butler in Heartthrob.
- Yes, of course.

196
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:49,098
- But you're much too young to remember.
- No, I do. I really do.

197
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,017
By the way, you're a reporter,
aren't you?

198
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:54,645
- I could give you an interview.
- Sure, except I'm not working yet.

199
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:59,025
My friends, we have a newspaper
reporter among us.

200
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,027
- Hello.
- Hello.

201
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:05,656
- I presume you will be staying here.
- Enjoy your meal.

202
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:20,796
I refuse to believe that the people
of Great Britain, always friends,

203
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:24,342
feel it their duty to lead Europe
into a catastrophe

204
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:28,012
by defending an African nation.

205
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:29,972
The resemblance is frightening.

206
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:33,476
Universally branded and without
the shadow of any kind of civilization

207
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:38,397
against this nation of heroes,
artists, poets, saints, navigators...

208
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:41,859
- Lucrezia!
- What do you want, Ma?

209
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:44,904
Send the young man in here.
I want to have a look.

210
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:48,282
- Antonietta, she wants to see him.
- All right, miss.

211
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:50,451
Shall I take him?

212
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:52,661
Ifthe Mediterranean
is a shortcut for England

213
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:56,374
and a permanent zone for Russia,
for us Italians it is like itself.

214
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:01,337
Keep still for a minute
or you'll knock me over.

215
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:02,713
May I come in?

216
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:08,177
- May I come in?
- Yes, and bring him with you.

217
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:18,145
You're so young
and distinguished-looking too.

218
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:21,107
You'll like it here.

219
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,776
I'm sure your mother wrote me,
you know. Poor woman.

220
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:28,030
- Did you show him the house?
- Of course, and he liked it too.

221
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:32,660
Good. You look like a nice boy.
That's all. You can go now.

222
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,329
One more thing before I forget.

223
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:40,418
Look me in the eyes, boy. There's
to be no fooling around in this house.

224
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:45,631
We're church-going people. We respect
others and want respect in return.

225
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:48,300
I wouldn't come to your house
and do anything dirty.

226
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:52,596
So let's live in peace
and not bust each other's balls.

227
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:56,267
Ma, I don't want to eat today.

228
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:59,895
Poor baby. Not even a teeny bite?
What has the sun done to you?

229
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:02,606
I want to lie next to you, Mama.

230
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:04,984
My God,
why couldn't you stay home?

231
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,430
We brought two chickens with us.

232
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:37,808
Hey, do you want me
to throw you in the oven?

233
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:43,314
And then we want
to eat at Ostia.

234
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:07,004
Hey! Sit down with us.

235
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:10,716
Marcello, give him a chair.
You're family now.

236
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:13,302
- I'll put him with these friends, OK?
- Was it good?

237
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:15,137
That's short pasta.

238
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:19,850
No, you don't.
I'll put the baby here.

239
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:22,102
Go on. Sit down.

240
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:26,440
You know the saying:
''The devil takes whoever eats alone.''

241
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:30,528
...cannolicchi, cheese and pepper,
penne in hot sauce.

242
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:32,071
Let me make up my own mind.

243
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:35,616
- What do you think?
- Take my advice. Cheese and pepper.

244
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:39,411
Cheese and pepper sauce. I had
that for lunch. What else is there?

245
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:41,997
How about rigatoni
in anchovy sauce?

246
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:44,959
All right, spit out that gum.
You're going to eat now.

247
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:47,086
And you keep still.

248
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:50,089
Fettuccine with chicken giblets...
Bucatini in carbonara sauce...

249
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:53,968
And then there's our specialities,
kidneys, tripe...

250
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:58,639
- Maybe the schiaffoni?
- I'll just try a small portion

251
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:03,185
because I've been having trouble
with my stomach all night long.

252
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:07,398
- Take my advice. Have the pajata.
- What's that, pajata?

253
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:10,651
It's calfgut filled with milk.

254
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:13,571
Remo, don't forget
this young gentleman.

255
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:18,158
Here, eat some ofthese.
They're not snails. They're pigeons.

256
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:23,330
- Giggetto, where are the bananas?
- Sorry, we're all out. Just one left.

257
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:26,000
- Then give me that one.
- Do you think I'm crazy?

258
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:31,338
- Who's that, Lallo's daughter?
- Whose do you think, the priest's?

259
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:35,092
Is she that big already? Isn't she cute?
Can't tell her face from her behind.

260
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:39,179
I dreamt about poor Aunt Judy last night
and asked her a winning number.

261
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:41,640
Then she fried this broccoli with
a mint leaf. You should have tasted it.

262
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:45,686
You know what they say:
''The more you eat, the more you shit.''

263
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:53,277
I told you not to let him eat any tripe.
He's had a fever since then.

264
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:56,113
All right, then give him
a couple of snails.

265
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:06,332
- But it almost killed him.
- Then I guess it'll kill me too.

266
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:20,471
Give her something to drink
so she'll shut her trap.

267
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:22,890
- Cheers!
- Go on. Drink up.

268
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:32,274
I want some ice cream!
Where's my ice cream?

269
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:36,904
You got to me once already.

270
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,114
Hey, verna!
Come on down!

271
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:43,619
Come on down! What's
the matter with you, anyway?

272
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:48,874
Come here before I beat
the hell out ofyou. Come on.

273
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:57,216
verna! Come on down!

274
00:27:58,426 --> 00:28:01,470
Tell your sister to get down here
before I throw her offthat balcony.

275
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:03,681
And hurry up.

276
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:09,478
I asked for a half-portion,
but this plate is practically empty.

277
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:18,529
You can always order more.

278
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:22,116
- Enjoy your meal everyone.
- Thanks.

279
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:24,952
- Bon appetite.
- Thank you. Say thank you.

280
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:29,456
Slowly. Don't eat so fast
or you'll choke to death.

281
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:36,422
Nobody's going
to steal your plate.

282
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:41,135
I'm not feeling well. I've had heartburn
since yesterday morning.

283
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:42,970
You have a big heart.

284
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:47,099
Silvano! Silvano! Here she is!
I brought her down.

285
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:49,059
Finally.

286
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:55,274
Here she is, everybody.
''verna the Sulker'' has arrived.

287
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:03,741
What...?
Now what's the matter?

288
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:12,207
- Come on. Let's make up. Come on.
- Just leave me in peace.

289
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:15,586
Open that sweet little mouth ofyours.
Come on. Open it.

290
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:22,760
- You silly, stupid shit.
- You're the stupid shit.

291
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:26,722
- Not me. You. That's who.
- You are both stupid shits.

292
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:31,477
These snails are too full of mint.
I can't taste anything else.

293
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:34,521
- Is that so?
- And not enough peppers.

294
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:38,567
Taste these, one of
our most popular specialities.

295
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:41,445
I'll show you how to eat them.
Watch carefully.

296
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:44,198
Here, take a pin and dig in.

297
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:50,287
You can learn a lot
from snails, young man.

298
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:53,499
Your girlfriend will explain that
to you one day.

299
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:02,549
I never eat snails in restaurants.

300
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:06,303
Only when I cook them myself
because I soak them for four days first.

301
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:09,389
Then you can... suck them clean.

302
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:11,809
But I wouldn't touch these ones!

303
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:13,727
Don't listen to what she says.

304
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:16,605
In Rome we say, ''No matter what
you eat, it all turns to shit.''

305
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:20,317
And what you eat tastes like shit.
Excuse me.

306
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:26,114
Mary had a little sheep
With the sheep she went to sleep

307
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:28,992
The sheep turned out to be a ram
Mary had a little lamb

308
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:34,873
Where'd she learn those?
Will you listen to that!

309
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:39,294
Some mother you are,
teaching her that stuff!

310
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,879
You taught her, not me.

311
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:43,298
What do you mean me?
I didn't teach her anything.

312
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:46,051
Pinocchio's nose was long
As long as Pinocchio's dong

313
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:48,303
Maestro, give me a ''la.''

314
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:07,030
All together now...

315
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:15,581
All right, all right, I'm coming.
Torquato, bring this guy a drink.

316
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:20,836
- Cough up some money for the orphans.
- We gave last year.

317
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:28,218
Give me that. I'll serve them.
How about this, eh?

318
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:32,598
And you'd better eat it all.
We don't believe in leftovers.

319
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:33,807
Will you keep still!

320
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:44,896
What about the Rome oftoday?

321
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:48,150
What impression does it make on
the visitor arriving for the first time?

322
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:50,694
Inevitably, coming offthe motorway

323
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,697
one finds oneself
on the Grande Raccordo Anulare

324
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:57,951
which circles the city
like one of Saturn's rings.

325
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:02,122
Scaratti at midfield?

326
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:05,709
Christ! We'll never win.

327
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:07,878
Five-nil.

328
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:09,838
You bet on the wrong team.

329
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,591
Oh, get lost.

330
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:49,795
- How much longer? It's about to rain.
- Almost ready.

331
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:53,298
Tough life, eh, boys?

332
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:55,258
Hold on tight.

333
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:28,226
Hey, you bloody gypsies, we're going to
stomp the shit out ofyou today.

334
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:31,855
Go get your sister
and we'll bust her cherry for her.

335
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:52,834
Can you hear me?
Raise the boom as high as you can.

336
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:21,501
Move! Move! Move!

337
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:47,086
Let's kick the ruling class
back out on its ass!

338
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:13,089
- Tell me what you see.
- I'm framing Piazza di Siena.

339
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:18,595
There's a tourist bus coming into the shot.
Shall I follow it?

340
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:20,179
Yeah, stay with it.

341
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:07,894
- Do you want a picture? I'll take it for you.
- Oh, thanks.

342
00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:13,608
You'll shine in a photo.

343
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:18,404
There. Don't move. Smile.

344
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:26,746
What are you framing now?

345
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:32,585
- Domes and bell towers.
- It's beautiful. I can see the whole city.

346
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:35,505
The piazzas, the streets,
people on their way to work.

347
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:38,257
Ifyou're seeing people on their way
to work, it ain't Rome.

348
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:39,509
Get lost.

349
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:42,595
You're up so high
you must be seeing another city.

350
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:45,515
That's what they say about Romans,
and here we are sweating blood all day.

351
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:49,811
This isn't Rome anymore. Everyone's
gone crazy. Too much of a hurry.

352
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:53,940
They've become mean.
The true Romans have disappeared.

353
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:56,859
You don't think so?
Just take a look around.

354
00:44:56,985 --> 00:45:00,780
All you see are filthy hippies,
students who don't want to study,

355
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:03,991
transvestites, drug addicts,
trash of every kind.

356
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:07,036
You're forgetting that this film
will be seen abroad.

357
00:45:07,162 --> 00:45:11,999
Ifyou show the perverts,
the street whores, negative aspects,

358
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:14,794
what are they going to think
of our lovely Rome?

359
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,295
What is it?

360
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,924
He wanted to ask you ifyour film
would give a Roman perspective

361
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:25,221
on the important and eternal problems
faced by modern-day society.

362
00:45:25,347 --> 00:45:28,182
And we're not only referring to
the problems in the educational system.

363
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:32,395
And the working world, with problems
in the factories, in housing.

364
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:36,941
We wouldn't want to see the same old
colourful Rome, easygoing, messy.

365
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:39,277
- The usual bland and commercial image.
- That's not the only Rome.

366
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:41,738
But I think a person
should be true to his own nature.

367
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:43,489
Lunch time!

368
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:49,287
- Pino, what do you see now?
- The station and a small dome.

369
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:52,957
Yeah, it must be the dome
ofthe old Barafonda Theatre.

370
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:55,752
That's what I'd like to film,
for example,

371
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:58,671
a variety show
at the Barafonda Theatre,

372
00:45:58,797 --> 00:46:01,382
thirty years ago,
at the beginning ofthe war.

373
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:46,260
Hey, shit-face!
So you're here too, eh?

374
00:46:46,386 --> 00:46:48,805
Will you move your big feet?

375
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:51,140
What do you say, Spino?
How's it going?

376
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:54,060
Give me a light, will you?

377
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:20,253
Sit down! Just cos you ate some glass
don't mean you're a window.

378
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:23,089
He can't help it.
He's never seen one before.

379
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:26,175
Don't look too hard,
you might hurt yourself.

380
00:47:29,638 --> 00:47:31,639
Take 'em away.

381
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:42,108
- Hey, Ciriola, how do you like that?
- She's really good looking, isn't she?

382
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:55,329
Hey, Pericles! Pericles!

383
00:47:57,833 --> 00:48:02,336
- Ding-Dong. What do you want?
- Shove that spotlight up your ass.

384
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:14,390
Here I am, ladies and gentlemen.
Good evening.

385
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:17,977
Most comedians start things off
with a joke or two before their routine.

386
00:48:18,103 --> 00:48:20,021
Hey, get offthe stage.

387
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:25,526
Well, I don't tell jokes
because I'm not very good at it.

388
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:28,779
So ifyou don't mind I'd like
to present a few of my imitations.

389
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:32,909
After my successful tour of Roccasecca,
Frascati, Marino and Zagarolo,

390
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:37,455
I was greatly honoured
to perform for the royal police force.

391
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:41,876
All right, shall we begin?
Just a moment.

392
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:44,921
The first imitation is that
of a man who has eaten too much.

393
00:48:51,219 --> 00:48:53,346
I said get offthe stage.

394
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:02,605
And now, my second imitation.

395
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:05,650
What's the matter, are you deaf?
The man said get off.

396
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:09,403
- Sit down, you big loudmouth.
- Second imitation.

397
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:13,783
A young lady having a shower.
Maestro!

398
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:20,456
Hey, do us all a favour
and go away!

399
00:49:21,249 --> 00:49:23,876
Yeah, go away!

400
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:27,713
Why? I've as much right to make
a living as anyone else, haven't I?

401
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:31,884
- Just disappear.
- All right, ifyou don't go, we will.

402
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:38,557
We'll pretend we enjoyed the act
and you pretend it's over. OK?

403
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:46,482
- I'm what's known as ''stile.''
- Stile, achmile, you stink too.

404
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:50,069
Here you have the modern-day saturnalia,
the variety show.

405
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:52,738
As you can see, it is a combination
of circus maximus and brothel.

406
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:56,117
Listen, ifyou're going to start
talking dirty, I'm leaving.

407
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:57,952
What did I say?
I mentioned a brothel.

408
00:49:58,078 --> 00:49:59,578
Even Proust,
in Remembrance of Things Past,

409
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:01,998
gives us a lengthy description
of a house of ill repute.

410
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:04,333
Oh, you and your damned Proust.

411
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:07,128
But I've got to work
like everyone else.

412
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:09,505
Yes. So go out and find a job.

413
00:50:09,631 --> 00:50:11,590
Hey, Maestro,
strike up the band.

414
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:44,999
That's so funny.

415
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:53,507
Will you shut your trap?
You guys are really making me laugh.

416
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:57,595
I'm laughing so much it hurts.

417
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:19,784
Goddamn bastards. Won't let decent
people enjoy an evening oftheatre.

418
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:22,995
- That man's a real artist, lady.
- Get lost.

419
00:51:23,121 --> 00:51:24,789
I heard a little noise

420
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:28,459
Coming from the audience

421
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:31,712
Get lost!

422
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:33,839
Listen, lady,
what do you want from me?

423
00:51:33,965 --> 00:51:36,842
Certain people
shouldn't be allowed in here.

424
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:41,597
I bought a ticket to enjoy the show.
So just shut up and leave me alone.

425
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:52,691
What are you trying to do?
Ruin everybody's evening?

426
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:54,819
Ifyou're not having fun,
go home and play with yourself.

427
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:56,529
Kiss my ass.

428
00:52:22,597 --> 00:52:25,057
- There.
- Madam, really!

429
00:52:25,183 --> 00:52:27,476
- You ought to be ashamed ofyourself.
- He's only human.

430
00:52:27,602 --> 00:52:30,062
We're all humans,
but we don't go around doing that.

431
00:52:30,188 --> 00:52:31,730
He's going to get my purse
right in his face.

432
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:46,370
What a bastard!

433
00:52:47,622 --> 00:52:51,000
Right, you little shit,
I'm going to smash your head in.

434
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:54,461
Have you lost your mind?
I didn't do it. It wasn't me.

435
00:52:58,758 --> 00:53:03,012
- I saw you throwing those beans at me.
- I keep telling you, it wasn't me.

436
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:05,306
I'm gonna rip your arms off.
Gonna rip 'em both off.

437
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:06,974
Pipe down, baldy.

438
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:10,102
Hey, Maestro,
see ifyou can play this.

439
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:14,732
- Stick it up your ass.
- How about this one?

440
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:18,319
Up your mother's too.

441
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:26,285
And now we come to the main attraction
ofthe evening...

442
00:53:26,411 --> 00:53:28,913
the Amateur Hour.

443
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:32,458
Where did that big bloke go?
The tall one with all those muscles?

444
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:34,376
He was right here a minute ago.

445
00:53:34,502 --> 00:53:36,170
- Did somebody shrink you?
- No.

446
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:37,630
- Born premature?
- Yes.

447
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:40,507
I bet he was born even before
Dad got through with Mother.

448
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:42,051
- What's your name?
- Alvaro.

449
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:44,345
- And what do you do?
- Tap dance.

450
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:46,722
- Yeah, but what do you do besides that?
- I'm an electrician.

451
00:53:46,848 --> 00:53:50,184
An electrician. And you learned
how to dance from all those shocks.

452
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:53,687
OK, ladies and gentlemen,
Alvaro!

453
00:53:55,273 --> 00:53:57,316
An imitation of Fred Astaire.

454
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:17,962
Help!

455
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:19,713
I feel sick!

456
00:54:20,548 --> 00:54:22,258
Help!

457
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:25,010
I feel sick! Help!

458
00:54:27,138 --> 00:54:29,556
Hey, Chiodo, it's here.

459
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,269
Here it is. Here it is.

460
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:36,355
Give me it. Give it here.

461
00:54:39,192 --> 00:54:40,734
Let me have it. Go on.

462
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:49,910
Make yourself a fur coat,
Fred Astaire.

463
00:54:56,835 --> 00:55:00,504
That's what you had for dinner, eh?
Double-time, Maestro.

464
00:55:17,355 --> 00:55:20,399
Ifyou'd thrown it at me,
you would have eaten it for sure.

465
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:24,111
- Your father's moustache!
- At least he wasn't queer like yours.

466
00:55:24,237 --> 00:55:27,281
Same to you.
I'll take care ofyou later.

467
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:29,408
Come here, darlin'.
Come over here.

468
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:32,703
- What's your name?
- Loredana Fiorini.

469
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:34,955
- And what are you going to sing?
- ''You Stole My Heart.''

470
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:37,291
''You Stole My Heart.''

471
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:38,584
Dickhead.

472
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:43,255
Get back in the toilet,
you bag of shit.

473
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:56,393
Have you got a match, young man?
I really don't know why they let her sing.

474
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:59,605
Wouldn't you be better off at home,
doing the dishes, girlie?

475
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:01,231
Thank you.

476
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:04,735
Whatever happened to talent?

477
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:07,279
I feel sorry for the poor girl.

478
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:14,328
Hope I didn't disturb you.

479
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:37,976
- Come with me for a minute.
- What do you wanna talk to me for?

480
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:39,144
Just for two minutes.

481
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:42,231
You must have me mixed up
with someone else.

482
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:44,441
I've not done anything,
you're making a big mistake.

483
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:45,859
Go on. Move.

484
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:11,385
Ladies and gentlemen,
the three Kants.

485
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:16,140
I said Kant and not what your
dirty minds are probably thinking.

486
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:46,378
''Trotta Cavallino''!

487
00:58:06,107 --> 00:58:07,649
Shut up!

488
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:12,821
You'd like to hear
''Trotta Cavallino''?

489
00:58:12,947 --> 00:58:15,532
I like it.
It's a nice song, isn't it?

490
00:58:54,113 --> 00:58:56,031
Hey, Orestes, give me a hand.

491
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:26,728
Your attention, please, everybody.

492
00:59:26,854 --> 00:59:31,108
Attention! We interrupt the show
to give you some good news.

493
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:32,901
After all, our country comes first!

494
00:59:33,319 --> 00:59:35,612
The radio just broadcast
the following war bulletin

495
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:37,906
which I'm proud to read to you.

496
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:42,160
''The attack on Sicily by the enemy
began last night

497
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:46,748
''backed by heavy naval and air support,
including paratroopers,

498
00:59:46,874 --> 00:59:49,960
''has received a setback
from our allied forces

499
00:59:50,086 --> 00:59:53,171
''fighting in south-eastern Italy.

500
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:59,553
''German artillery have downed seven
aircraft and damaged three steamships.

501
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:02,889
''This treacherous attack against our
country's sacred soil will be crushed

502
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:05,225
''and the enemy thrown into the sea.

503
01:00:05,351 --> 01:00:08,312
''For the greater glory
of our fatherland and its Duce.''

504
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:09,896
Long live Italy!

505
01:01:40,446 --> 01:01:43,824
Oh, baby! Baby!

506
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:46,034
Where have you been all my life?

507
01:01:47,495 --> 01:01:49,746
All right, that's enough from you.
Now sit down!

508
01:01:49,872 --> 01:01:52,249
Can I help it if I like women?

509
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:54,710
Watch out how you talk
to my father!

510
01:01:54,836 --> 01:01:58,088
- I'd sit down if I were you!
- There it is!

511
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:16,606
I'm in love with you, angel eyes,
you and your nice little bum!

512
01:02:21,028 --> 01:02:22,863
Hey, isn't that the siren?

513
01:02:23,614 --> 01:02:29,161
It's an air raid!

514
01:02:33,958 --> 01:02:38,587
The audience is requested
to go to the air raid shelter

515
01:02:38,713 --> 01:02:41,631
at number  104,  104.

516
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:45,510
Whose kid is this?
Who gave me this little boy?

517
01:02:45,636 --> 01:02:48,430
Please keep calm.
Please keep calm.

518
01:02:48,556 --> 01:02:50,557
Hey, Romolo! The chorus girls!

519
01:02:50,683 --> 01:02:52,726
Over here! Over here!

520
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:12,329
Put that light out!

521
01:03:31,098 --> 01:03:32,808
What time is it?

522
01:03:33,559 --> 01:03:37,229
There I was, sound asleep,
if it wasn't for that idiot.

523
01:03:37,355 --> 01:03:40,232
Excuse me. What did you say?
''If it wasn't for that idiot''?

524
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:42,025
What did I say? I don't know.

525
01:03:42,151 --> 01:03:44,152
Speak up.
What did you mean by that?

526
01:03:44,278 --> 01:03:47,656
- He didn't mean anything by it.
- I didn't mean anything.

527
01:03:47,782 --> 01:03:50,116
It's unforgivable!

528
01:03:50,243 --> 01:03:52,786
Certain people ought
to be ashamed ofthemselves.

529
01:03:52,912 --> 01:03:56,581
Especially now, with our country
united as never before

530
01:03:56,707 --> 01:03:59,543
on the verge ofvictory,
and you still hear defeatist remarks!

531
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:01,711
Shame on you!

532
01:04:05,132 --> 01:04:07,217
Fascist Italy. The Duce.

533
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:10,011
They're your only hope.

534
01:04:10,137 --> 01:04:11,763
- And we must win.
- Yes.

535
01:04:11,889 --> 01:04:13,974
- And we will win.
- Right.

536
01:04:19,146 --> 01:04:21,648
Do you want a cigarette?

537
01:04:21,774 --> 01:04:24,442
Smoke ruin my voice.
No very good.

538
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:26,778
- Oh, you sing?
- Yes.

539
01:04:26,904 --> 01:04:29,072
I learn in my city, Dusseldorf.

540
01:04:29,198 --> 01:04:30,407
Have you been in Italy long?

541
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:34,286
I been to Roma,
Milano, Bergamo, Como.

542
01:04:34,412 --> 01:04:36,872
This Hans, oldest son.

543
01:04:37,373 --> 01:04:39,124
What do you want?

544
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:43,587
This is my husband in Russia,
Wehrmacht.

545
01:05:18,706 --> 01:05:21,416
You come rest a little with me?

546
01:05:21,542 --> 01:05:23,710
My boarding-house is very near.

547
01:05:23,836 --> 01:05:27,589
They won't bomb us
as long as the Pope's in Rome.

548
01:05:27,715 --> 01:05:29,549
Good night, Anita.

549
01:05:29,675 --> 01:05:31,885
Might as well say good morning.

550
01:05:32,011 --> 01:05:34,763
- What's that booming?
- My God, do you hear that?

551
01:05:34,889 --> 01:05:36,973
Mother of God! They're bombs!

552
01:05:38,851 --> 01:05:40,477
Help! Help!

553
01:05:45,232 --> 01:05:47,233
We're being bombed!

554
01:05:48,069 --> 01:05:49,319
Help!

555
01:05:49,445 --> 01:05:53,740
Alberto's house has gone!
The babies! The babies!

556
01:05:53,866 --> 01:05:55,408
Help! Help!

557
01:06:50,881 --> 01:06:52,632
Can I shoot a bit of it?

558
01:06:52,758 --> 01:06:54,926
Go ahead, ifyou like.

559
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:58,596
A perfectly preserved mammoth's tusk.

560
01:06:58,723 --> 01:07:01,683
We discovered it during construction
ofthe Piazza Re di Roma station.

561
01:07:01,809 --> 01:07:03,810
The Capitoline Museum
has already asked for it.

562
01:07:03,936 --> 01:07:06,396
Shall we go down?
This way, please.

563
01:07:22,246 --> 01:07:26,666
I could've used the subway
trying to cross town this afternoon.

564
01:07:26,792 --> 01:07:28,293
I wish they'd finish it.

565
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:30,295
What was that?

566
01:07:50,649 --> 01:07:53,943
The ground beneath Rome
is unpredictable.

567
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:57,864
Every hundred metres,
we come across some important find.

568
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:04,329
Naturally, this slows up the work.

569
01:08:04,455 --> 01:08:06,915
This is a very difficult contract.

570
01:08:07,041 --> 01:08:10,919
We merely wanted to resolve
the traffic problem

571
01:08:11,045 --> 01:08:14,756
with a subway
like Munich's or Dublin's

572
01:08:14,882 --> 01:08:17,717
but here the ground has eight strata

573
01:08:17,843 --> 01:08:21,638
and we're forced
to become archaeologists.

574
01:08:23,265 --> 01:08:27,894
The first time the necessity
of a subway for Rome

575
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:30,105
was discussed was in 1871.

576
01:08:30,231 --> 01:08:32,857
- You mean 1971.
- No, exactly a hundred years ago.

577
01:08:33,859 --> 01:08:37,403
Roman bureaucracy is even more
unpredictable than Roman soil.

578
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:40,657
The paperwork which has passed
between ourselves

579
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:43,535
and the community of Rome is enough
to fill the entire length of subway.

580
01:08:44,203 --> 01:08:46,996
Right now we're passing
beneath the Appio Quarter.

581
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:51,292
Agenore!
Agenore, what's that?

582
01:08:51,418 --> 01:08:53,753
My God, it's an earthquake!

583
01:08:57,091 --> 01:09:01,094
Agenore!
Oh, my God! My God!

584
01:09:11,438 --> 01:09:13,481
The buildings overhead
began to crack.

585
01:09:13,607 --> 01:09:15,942
- Are we coming to the end?
- I don't think so.

586
01:09:16,068 --> 01:09:17,235
Hey, look at this, will you?

587
01:09:17,361 --> 01:09:21,447
Looks like a big cork
stuck in the end ofthe tunnel.

588
01:09:24,618 --> 01:09:26,619
Where are we now?

589
01:09:26,745 --> 01:09:30,999
Beneath the Appia Antica,
near San Sebastiano Gate.

590
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:35,086
To your left you can hear the roar
of a genuine underground river.

591
01:09:35,212 --> 01:09:37,547
It emerges about
ten kilometres from here

592
01:09:37,673 --> 01:09:40,049
at a place called ''Cessati Spiriti.''

593
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:44,304
- What did he say?
- He said the noise comes from a river.

594
01:09:50,561 --> 01:09:54,063
When will the whole thing
be completed?

595
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:55,940
I don't know.

596
01:10:08,495 --> 01:10:09,746
Michael, look!

597
01:10:18,339 --> 01:10:20,381
How many hours
do they work down here?

598
01:10:20,507 --> 01:10:22,425
Ten hours straight, I think.

599
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:34,562
At this point,
we had to change course again.

600
01:10:34,688 --> 01:10:38,650
On the left you can see
a necropolis with 400 skeletons.

601
01:10:38,776 --> 01:10:40,068
Third strata.

602
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:11,849
Track 22!

603
01:11:14,019 --> 01:11:17,939
Rinaldo, the current
in the right channel has gone down!

604
01:11:18,065 --> 01:11:22,402
Stop!

605
01:11:25,864 --> 01:11:29,409
Sir, I think we've run
into another hollow spot.

606
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:31,494
It's been showing on the gauge
for two days.

607
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:34,414
- Do they sleep down here?
- I think they do.

608
01:11:45,509 --> 01:11:47,885
We've got to suspend
the work again, sir.

609
01:11:48,012 --> 01:11:50,847
- What's happened?
- Come have a look at the gauge.

610
01:12:06,238 --> 01:12:08,948
Take the flame cutter
to number three.

611
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:23,046
We've got a hollow spot
as big as the Alban Hills!

612
01:12:26,508 --> 01:12:28,718
What is it, Amirildo?
Don't you feel well?

613
01:12:28,844 --> 01:12:30,470
I don't know what it is.

614
01:12:37,478 --> 01:12:40,563
Ragu, the right wheel!

615
01:12:40,689 --> 01:12:42,857
The right wheel, Ragu!

616
01:12:42,983 --> 01:12:47,403
Hey! Stop the drill!

617
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:41,707
It goes like this. Now we know
there is an open space on the other side.

618
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:45,670
The archaeologists will make us
suspend work for a couple of months.

619
01:13:45,796 --> 01:13:48,631
It could be a cavern
or some catacombs.

620
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:53,302
We could try testing the wall
very carefully in different spots.

621
01:13:53,762 --> 01:13:55,721
Start up the cutter.

622
01:15:10,547 --> 01:15:13,007
- Stop the cutter.
- Stop the cutter!

623
01:15:17,304 --> 01:15:23,601
Michael, look! There are Roman paintings!
Frescoes! They're fantastic!

624
01:15:26,980 --> 01:15:29,774
Down this way, sir.

625
01:15:34,905 --> 01:15:36,781
A Roman house

626
01:15:36,907 --> 01:15:39,116
from 2,000 years ago.

627
01:17:13,378 --> 01:17:15,171
Michael, look at their faces.

628
01:17:15,297 --> 01:17:17,131
Keep your mask on.

629
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:29,810
It's as ifthey were staring at us.

630
01:17:46,203 --> 01:17:49,038
Look! Aim the light down there!

631
01:17:50,832 --> 01:17:52,124
There!

632
01:18:00,342 --> 01:18:03,469
Hey! Look at this!
What's happening?

633
01:18:10,102 --> 01:18:13,062
The frescoes are fading.

634
01:18:13,188 --> 01:18:16,065
It's the air from outside.

635
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:20,319
The fresh air
is destroying the frescoes.

636
01:18:21,196 --> 01:18:24,115
Oh, no! How awful!

637
01:18:28,412 --> 01:18:32,498
Michael! What can we do?
We've got to do something.

638
01:18:35,877 --> 01:18:37,503
Do something!

639
01:19:55,791 --> 01:20:01,170
For these disenchanted youngsters,
huddled together like puppies,

640
01:20:01,296 --> 01:20:03,005
making love is not a problem.

641
01:20:03,131 --> 01:20:04,757
They might do it,
or they might not.

642
01:20:04,883 --> 01:20:08,385
But it certainly isn't as complicated
as it once was for us

643
01:20:08,512 --> 01:20:12,807
when our amorous yearning
led us to the nearest brothel.

644
01:20:13,767 --> 01:20:15,434
Remember?

645
01:20:38,124 --> 01:20:40,000
Come on, move!

646
01:21:11,908 --> 01:21:16,161
All right, stop messing around like yobs
just out of prison.

647
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:18,539
Go and screw your grandma!

648
01:21:19,207 --> 01:21:22,459
Where are you going? How old are you?
Show me your ID.

649
01:21:38,643 --> 01:21:41,562
Let's go! Move it! Upstairs!

650
01:21:41,688 --> 01:21:44,940
Come on, who's going to be first?

651
01:21:50,155 --> 01:21:53,073
Come on! Come on! Can't you see
the tongue she's got on her?

652
01:21:55,702 --> 01:21:58,746
Come on, boys, make up your minds!
You too, Gramps.

653
01:21:58,872 --> 01:22:01,081
What's the matter?
Are you all asleep on your feet?

654
01:22:03,919 --> 01:22:06,503
All right! Enough ofthis shit!

655
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:10,299
Pretty soon I'm going to turn off
the lights and kick everyone out!

656
01:22:10,425 --> 01:22:13,761
Have you got blood in your veins
or water?

657
01:22:14,971 --> 01:22:17,848
Every one ofthese girls is an artist.
Are you guys blind?

658
01:22:17,974 --> 01:22:21,727
- Now get your asses upstairs.
- All right, let me by. Let me by.

659
01:22:26,900 --> 01:22:29,652
Let's go upstairs, girls.
Come on.

660
01:22:29,778 --> 01:22:33,030
Come on, boys.
The young ladies are all here.

661
01:22:33,156 --> 01:22:35,866
Teresa!
Where the hell's my coffee?

662
01:22:35,992 --> 01:22:38,702
It's coming.
I already ordered it.

663
01:22:39,663 --> 01:22:44,625
You wanna come with me, yes or no?
Come on, come on, soldier boy.

664
01:22:44,751 --> 01:22:47,962
I don't want to sleep by myself.
I don't want to sleep by myself.

665
01:22:52,592 --> 01:22:54,635
Hey, Rita, turn around.

666
01:22:55,095 --> 01:22:57,596
I wouldn't take you
even ifyou gave me food for a month.

667
01:22:57,722 --> 01:23:00,724
Why don't you
go take the next train

668
01:23:00,850 --> 01:23:03,185
back to Naples, fuckface?

669
01:23:03,311 --> 01:23:05,604
Come on, honey!

670
01:23:05,730 --> 01:23:07,898
Ifyou wanna stand there and jerk off,
then go home and do it.

671
01:23:13,363 --> 01:23:15,948
What kind of men are you?

672
01:23:16,074 --> 01:23:18,367
Ifyou keep waiting,
it's going to drop offfrom old age

673
01:23:18,493 --> 01:23:20,703
and not even the cat
will eat it then.

674
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:22,871
It's closing time.

675
01:23:22,998 --> 01:23:25,541
They're all pretty
and they're real artists!

676
01:23:25,667 --> 01:23:30,295
- Is Dolores back?
- She went to have a bite to eat.

677
01:23:30,422 --> 01:23:32,381
Who's going to come upstairs
with the pride of Florence?

678
01:23:32,507 --> 01:23:34,258
That's a good boy.

679
01:23:35,635 --> 01:23:38,345
Look! Those tits
must weigh 40 pounds each.

680
01:23:38,471 --> 01:23:39,930
Shut your fucking trap!

681
01:23:46,521 --> 01:23:48,605
What's an ugly, skinny bitch like you
doing in a nice place like this?

682
01:23:48,732 --> 01:23:51,275
So why'd you go upstairs, then?
Just to make fun of a working girl?

683
01:23:51,401 --> 01:23:54,403
- Two.
- I've got a good mind to call the cops.

684
01:23:56,573 --> 01:23:59,491
I'll throw you down the stairs
three at a time, you bastards.

685
01:24:16,843 --> 01:24:22,181
Come on!
Come on. Come on. Come on.

686
01:24:30,106 --> 01:24:32,983
There she goes again. Every time
it rains, she gets hysterical.

687
01:24:34,861 --> 01:24:39,865
- Marcella. Watch out for her nails.
- All right. Who's my next victim?

688
01:24:39,991 --> 01:24:41,658
You thieving bitch.

689
01:24:41,993 --> 01:24:44,870
Nives, calm down.
Wanna come upstairs, handsome?

690
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:50,959
Let's go. Let's go.

691
01:24:55,006 --> 01:24:58,884
Shut up. Tonight you can
pack up and get out.

692
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:01,845
Two monkeys!

693
01:25:07,602 --> 01:25:10,270
- Let the lady by!
- What is this shit?

694
01:25:10,396 --> 01:25:12,981
Think you're a bloody cop, do you?
Don't shove me around.

695
01:25:13,108 --> 01:25:14,900
Ladies, up to your rooms, please.

696
01:25:15,026 --> 01:25:18,028
All right, gentlemen.
Everybody out, please. Out.

697
01:25:18,154 --> 01:25:19,988
The ladies are going to eat.

698
01:25:20,532 --> 01:25:22,241
We're closing.

699
01:25:22,367 --> 01:25:23,992
Turn offthe lights.
We're closed.

700
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:26,411
Go get some fresh air.
We're closed. Everybody out.

701
01:25:29,374 --> 01:25:31,250
All right! Time to go home.

702
01:25:31,376 --> 01:25:36,213
Everybody out.
Time to go home!

703
01:25:38,299 --> 01:25:41,051
All right, buster! Cut it out.
I'm not your sister.

704
01:25:48,059 --> 01:25:53,230
Who knows why, why we live

705
01:25:53,356 --> 01:25:58,694
And why the fuck we die

706
01:26:01,906 --> 01:26:03,824
But there were also
some very sophisticated houses

707
01:26:03,950 --> 01:26:06,910
which would make your heart beat
in fear and excitement.

708
01:26:24,804 --> 01:26:26,680
Sit down, sit down.

709
01:26:50,663 --> 01:26:55,292
What's the matter? What's everybody
so quiet about? This won't do at all.

710
01:26:55,418 --> 01:26:58,128
Come on, who wants to come up
to my room for a game of chess?

711
01:27:00,298 --> 01:27:02,549
How are you, darlin'?
Don't you love me today?

712
01:27:05,845 --> 01:27:09,932
This morning I woke up feeling aroused.
OK, gents, who's going to be first?

713
01:27:13,353 --> 01:27:14,645
Here I am.

714
01:27:14,771 --> 01:27:17,314
I can't wait to get back to my room.
Let's not waste any time.

715
01:27:21,027 --> 01:27:24,321
Come on!

716
01:27:24,447 --> 01:27:27,491
- Babies, are you afraid of mama?
- Last chance, gents.

717
01:27:27,617 --> 01:27:31,828
I'm off. I'm going up to bed.
Last chance, gentlemen.

718
01:27:32,163 --> 01:27:35,791
I'm all on fire!
I'm all on fire!

719
01:27:39,504 --> 01:27:42,714
Where the hell do you think you are?
It's not your home.

720
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:45,175
All I want is one good man.

721
01:27:45,301 --> 01:27:49,221
Come on! I'm Spanish and hot.

722
01:27:49,347 --> 01:27:50,806
Come on, men, move it!

723
01:27:57,522 --> 01:27:58,605
Come on!

724
01:28:01,901 --> 01:28:03,944
Oh, my babies, shame on you!

725
01:28:04,904 --> 01:28:09,032
Who nailed your feet to the floor?
Dad! See if I've got something in my eye.

726
01:28:09,409 --> 01:28:12,536
Where's my nice little sailor?
Who's going to ride my ship?

727
01:28:12,662 --> 01:28:14,913
Where's my nice little sailor?

728
01:28:42,442 --> 01:28:45,360
I'm so excited,
I can't even think straight!

729
01:28:45,486 --> 01:28:49,698
Take anyone you want.
Come on and quit pretending.

730
01:28:49,824 --> 01:28:52,367
I've seen you here before, stupid.

731
01:28:53,244 --> 01:28:58,332
Gentlemen, shame on you for keeping
all these beautiful ladies waiting.

732
01:28:58,458 --> 01:29:00,792
All clear! All clear!

733
01:29:10,928 --> 01:29:12,054
But I have to leave.

734
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:14,514
No, you don't, not yet.
I'm not losing myjob on account ofyou.

735
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:16,266
Damn it! Some bigwig, I bet.

736
01:29:18,186 --> 01:29:20,812
Gentlemen,
please remain where you are

737
01:29:20,938 --> 01:29:23,482
and don't leave the room
for the next five minutes.

738
01:29:23,608 --> 01:29:25,025
Thank you.

739
01:29:28,696 --> 01:29:29,946
I see.

740
01:29:31,449 --> 01:29:35,202
Ladies, upstairs to your rooms,
please.

741
01:29:37,413 --> 01:29:41,041
Hurry up, please. Thank you.

742
01:29:41,167 --> 01:29:44,503
- Who's arrived, the mayor?
- Who knows? Maybe it is.

743
01:29:44,629 --> 01:29:47,756
Maybe so, l don't know

744
01:29:47,882 --> 01:29:49,883
i don't know, maybe so

745
01:30:03,898 --> 01:30:07,692
Experience, my dear.
That's what counts in life.

746
01:30:07,819 --> 01:30:11,530
Ifyour son's experienced,
he'll never have any problems.

747
01:30:12,657 --> 01:30:15,617
I think that dark guy wants you.

748
01:30:15,743 --> 01:30:17,619
But if he's not experienced

749
01:30:17,745 --> 01:30:22,124
all he'll get is a royal screwing, right?

750
01:30:22,250 --> 01:30:24,418
It's so true.
Dolores is always right.

751
01:30:25,253 --> 01:30:26,753
Not always, no.

752
01:30:51,070 --> 01:30:52,946
You are very beautiful, you know.

753
01:30:54,657 --> 01:30:56,158
Where are you from?

754
01:30:56,284 --> 01:30:57,659
Santa Maria la Bruna.

755
01:30:57,785 --> 01:30:59,578
- Where's that?
- Near Pompeii.

756
01:31:00,955 --> 01:31:03,832
- Is that your son?
- Yes, that's my son.

757
01:31:08,045 --> 01:31:10,797
But you...
How long have you...?

758
01:31:10,923 --> 01:31:12,507
Two years.

759
01:31:13,801 --> 01:31:17,596
Listen, I mean,
how did you happen to...

760
01:31:18,347 --> 01:31:21,850
What the hell. I found myself alone,
and Assuntina said, ''Come with us.

761
01:31:21,976 --> 01:31:24,311
You'll like it, you'll see.
I'll introduce you.''

762
01:31:24,437 --> 01:31:26,229
Lace me up?

763
01:31:28,399 --> 01:31:30,358
To tell the truth,
I can't complain.

764
01:31:30,485 --> 01:31:33,153
The signora likes me
and I've got everything I need.

765
01:31:36,741 --> 01:31:39,868
Does that mean you wouldn't
want to leave this place?

766
01:31:39,994 --> 01:31:41,495
To do what?

767
01:31:42,288 --> 01:31:45,874
Haven't you ever fallen in love?
Haven't you ever met someone...

768
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,668
Sure I have.
And this is the result.

769
01:31:50,588 --> 01:31:53,089
Listen. Couldn't we
see each other sometime?

770
01:31:53,424 --> 01:31:55,467
Do you ever go out?

771
01:31:55,593 --> 01:31:58,053
Some morning, whenever you want,

772
01:31:58,179 --> 01:32:00,680
we could go to the beach for lunch.

773
01:32:02,767 --> 01:32:05,435
Really, I'd like to take you out.

774
01:32:06,479 --> 01:32:08,688
Let's make a date.

775
01:32:08,940 --> 01:32:11,608
Tomorrow, OK?
The day after tomorrow?

776
01:32:20,743 --> 01:32:23,703
Perhaps you have heard
of Princess Domitilla.

777
01:32:24,580 --> 01:32:26,957
Her mother Fabiola,
her grandfather Eugenio

778
01:32:27,083 --> 01:32:29,042
and her ancestors further back

779
01:32:29,168 --> 01:32:32,170
were all born in this palazzo

780
01:32:32,296 --> 01:32:34,839
where today Domitilla lives alone.

781
01:33:20,386 --> 01:33:22,429
Salvatore! Domenico!

782
01:33:23,806 --> 01:33:26,057
Can't you hear the carriage?
He's arrived.

783
01:33:27,393 --> 01:33:28,768
Go.

784
01:33:41,157 --> 01:33:42,324
At last.

785
01:33:55,921 --> 01:33:59,132
Your Eminence! Thank you.
Thank you so much.

786
01:34:00,009 --> 01:34:02,677
Princess Domitilla!
There. There.

787
01:34:02,803 --> 01:34:06,181
How nice it is
to see you all again.

788
01:34:07,516 --> 01:34:09,351
Good evening.

789
01:34:09,477 --> 01:34:13,563
I hope you are all well,
with the grace of God.

790
01:34:16,525 --> 01:34:18,276
You must be Francesca, is that right?

791
01:34:18,402 --> 01:34:20,320
Yes, I'm Francesca,
Your Eminence.

792
01:34:21,989 --> 01:34:23,990
Ah, my eyes
aren't what they used to be.

793
01:34:24,116 --> 01:34:26,242
And is this little rascal
still causing his mother trouble?

794
01:34:26,369 --> 01:34:28,662
It's not true.
How can you say that?

795
01:34:28,788 --> 01:34:32,040
But of course, I was onlyjoking.
Well, isn't it little Filippo!

796
01:34:32,166 --> 01:34:35,835
Remember when you used to drink
the wine out ofthe ampullae?

797
01:34:35,961 --> 01:34:39,506
And who are these little devils?
Augustarello's children, eh?

798
01:34:39,632 --> 01:34:42,509
How do you do? We've already met.

799
01:34:42,635 --> 01:34:44,594
I gave you your first Communion.

800
01:34:44,720 --> 01:34:46,513
This little blond boy
I've never seen.

801
01:34:46,639 --> 01:34:48,181
- What's your name?
- Giulio.

802
01:34:48,307 --> 01:34:51,768
Are you good?
I bet only when you're asleep.

803
01:34:53,145 --> 01:34:55,522
And now offto bed, eh?

804
01:34:55,648 --> 01:34:58,858
Good night, children,
and God bless you.

805
01:34:58,984 --> 01:35:00,443
Good night, Your Eminence.

806
01:35:00,569 --> 01:35:02,779
IfYour Eminence
will come this way.

807
01:35:02,905 --> 01:35:05,156
My friends! Please sit down.

808
01:35:05,282 --> 01:35:09,661
Ah, yes, why, even today
there was an audience with people

809
01:35:09,787 --> 01:35:12,872
who want to tell the Pope
how to run the church.

810
01:35:14,667 --> 01:35:17,001
What can you do?
Be patient, I suppose.

811
01:35:17,128 --> 01:35:19,754
''Fire's for burning
and patience for learning''

812
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:21,381
as we say in Rome.

813
01:35:28,013 --> 01:35:31,975
I remember your grandfather.
He was a good man, Don Eugenio.

814
01:35:33,728 --> 01:35:37,355
My compliments.

815
01:35:37,481 --> 01:35:38,857
Please! Please!

816
01:35:38,983 --> 01:35:40,650
My friends.

817
01:35:40,776 --> 01:35:42,986
- Please sit down.
- Thank you.

818
01:35:47,575 --> 01:35:51,077
Peppino, Gervasio,
you may begin serving.

819
01:35:51,203 --> 01:35:53,288
Ah, you've finally arrived!

820
01:35:53,414 --> 01:35:55,039
What would you like,
Your Eminence?

821
01:35:55,166 --> 01:35:59,002
- A mint to freshen my mouth, thank you.
- Ah, a mint. I knew it.

822
01:35:59,128 --> 01:36:00,795
Here we are.

823
01:36:05,009 --> 01:36:06,926
- Your Excellency.
- Why not?

824
01:36:07,052 --> 01:36:08,595
Thank you. I'd love one.

825
01:36:08,721 --> 01:36:10,764
- What would you like, Monsignor?
- Monsignor.

826
01:36:11,348 --> 01:36:15,643
I must tell you that when I was little,
I was quite a mischief maker.

827
01:36:15,770 --> 01:36:17,312
What did he say?

828
01:36:17,438 --> 01:36:19,022
He said when he was young,
he was a rascal.

829
01:36:19,148 --> 01:36:22,275
Mama used to make a liqueur
just like this for the guests

830
01:36:22,401 --> 01:36:25,987
and she would have
to hide it from me.

831
01:36:26,113 --> 01:36:31,409
The minute she wasn't there, I'd climb
up and drink it out ofthe bottle.

832
01:36:31,911 --> 01:36:34,496
Your Eminence, I can't believe it.

833
01:36:34,622 --> 01:36:37,207
I'm sure that even as a baby,
you were a saint.

834
01:36:39,585 --> 01:36:42,003
A long life to His Eminence.

835
01:36:51,806 --> 01:36:53,890
How much time has passed.

836
01:36:54,016 --> 01:36:57,185
Everything seems so far away,
so different.

837
01:36:57,311 --> 01:37:01,314
i'm sorry to leave this life
in a city which is no longer home.

838
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:03,733
The Rome l knew was different.

839
01:37:03,859 --> 01:37:06,820
People were nicer, more respectful.

840
01:37:06,946 --> 01:37:08,947
Everyone knew everyone else.

841
01:37:09,073 --> 01:37:11,991
Monsignors, cardinals, the Pope.

842
01:37:12,117 --> 01:37:14,619
They were all either friends
or relatives.

843
01:37:17,581 --> 01:37:20,500
Friendship with the church
has been lost.

844
01:37:21,502 --> 01:37:23,378
The marvellous balls

845
01:37:24,505 --> 01:37:26,631
in villas and palazzos

846
01:37:28,175 --> 01:37:32,470
with all those cardinals dressed in red
wandering about the house.

847
01:37:32,596 --> 01:37:37,851
It was like living in a painting
and at Christmas.

848
01:37:37,977 --> 01:37:40,937
Now, why should I suddenly
remember that?

849
01:37:41,063 --> 01:37:43,481
The little presents
Monsignor Altieri would give me.

850
01:37:43,607 --> 01:37:45,525
Wax statuettes,

851
01:37:45,651 --> 01:37:50,572
crosses out ofwoven straw
and a lot ofvelvet for the toy manger.

852
01:37:50,698 --> 01:37:52,991
And all of it gone,
lost over the years.

853
01:37:53,117 --> 01:37:56,911
Who knows where all those
little wax statues have gone?

854
01:38:16,765 --> 01:38:19,392
For the following presentation
of ecclesiastical fashions,

855
01:38:19,518 --> 01:38:22,979
we welcome His Eminence
and our other illustrious guests.

01:39:23,749 --> 01:39:28,086
The same model may be done
in another type offabric

859
01:39:28,212 --> 01:39:31,422
such as silk or wool,
according to the season.

860
01:39:31,548 --> 01:39:34,550
The boots are in leather and suede
in two colours.

861
01:39:34,677 --> 01:39:37,929

Starched cap with flexible wings.

864
01:40:02,454 --> 01:40:05,039
Useful also for interiors
with poor air circulation.

865
01:40:20,848 --> 01:40:24,684
Model No. 3: little sisters
ofthe purgatory's temptation.

866
01:40:38,699 --> 01:40:42,410
The world must follow the church
and not vice versa.

867
01:40:43,078 --> 01:40:44,954
And now for the more casual modes:

868
01:40:45,080 --> 01:40:47,373
quicker to paradise!

869
01:41:25,287 --> 01:41:29,540
Here you have Model No. 6
for country priests.

870
01:41:48,310 --> 01:41:52,230
Sacristan variations
for first-class ceremonies.

871
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:35,815
The sacerdotal vestments
have passed through evolution:

872
01:42:35,941 --> 01:42:38,317
Anitto, viviale

873
01:42:38,443 --> 01:42:40,987
cotta, vianita and casula.

874
01:42:41,113 --> 01:42:44,657
All types ofvestments are made today
ofvery light fabrics

875
01:42:44,783 --> 01:42:47,326
in the most brilliant colours,
which don't fade.

876
01:48:06,521 --> 01:48:08,522
One, two,

877
01:48:08,648 --> 01:48:10,274
three, go!

878
01:48:34,799 --> 01:48:39,220
Balloons! Balloons!
All colours and shapes.

879
01:48:43,725 --> 01:48:46,185
First he has a drink
before he eats an egg,

880
01:48:46,311 --> 01:48:48,771
then he has a drink
while he's eating the egg,

881
01:48:48,897 --> 01:48:51,357
and now he wants a drink
because he's eaten an egg!

882
01:48:51,483 --> 01:48:52,566
Jesus!

883
01:48:52,692 --> 01:48:54,860
Won't he get sick
from all those eggs?

884
01:48:59,533 --> 01:49:03,410
Balloons for you.
For children and for grown-ups too.

885
01:49:07,916 --> 01:49:11,460
- What the hell do you want?
- Go on, it's red!

886
01:49:12,712 --> 01:49:15,714
They're making their movie
all over the place

887
01:49:15,840 --> 01:49:17,508
but not paying anybody.

888
01:49:23,014 --> 01:49:26,267
This pork's from genuine Ariccia pig!
How about a slice?

889
01:49:26,393 --> 01:49:31,438
''Rooky'' here! ''Rooky'' here!
''Leal'' silk! ''Pletty sirk scalf!''

890
01:49:31,565 --> 01:49:33,274
''Pletty sirk scalf.''

891
01:49:33,400 --> 01:49:35,609
Hey, Brit, do they sell
pork sandwiches in Germany?

892
01:49:44,661 --> 01:49:48,497
Leave Grandpa alone!
Let him sleep. Why bring him along?

893
01:50:00,969 --> 01:50:04,054
Hey, Torquato! Some petrol!

894
01:50:04,681 --> 01:50:05,931
Petrol.

895
01:50:13,356 --> 01:50:16,025
Antique paintings.
Fancy frames!

896
01:50:18,361 --> 01:50:20,279
very cheap!

897
01:50:20,405 --> 01:50:23,407
I'm going back to the cemetery tomorrow.
Fancy coming?

898
01:50:23,533 --> 01:50:25,618
They gave him a nice spot.
Really sunny!

899
01:50:44,095 --> 01:50:46,305
Hey, you bystanders,
where are you going?

900
01:50:46,431 --> 01:50:48,349
Why don't you eat here?

901
01:50:48,475 --> 01:50:51,644
Hey, young man,
where are you going to feed her?

902
01:50:51,770 --> 01:50:55,314
Your wife! Well, come on over then
and buy her a decent meal for a change.

903
01:51:27,305 --> 01:51:30,724
Checco! It stinks
like hell over here!

904
01:51:30,850 --> 01:51:33,769
Did you have to give us a table
next to the manhole?

905
01:51:33,895 --> 01:51:36,355
It's not true! That's the smell
of history, honey, centuries.

906
01:51:36,481 --> 01:51:39,316
You shit! You shit!
I'll slit your belly open.

907
01:51:39,442 --> 01:51:42,945
You always believe everything
that dumb bitch tells you?

908
01:51:47,242 --> 01:51:50,911
There! It's Gore vidal,
the American writer. Let's ask him.

909
01:51:51,037 --> 01:51:52,496
Good evening, Mr vidal.

910
01:51:52,622 --> 01:51:54,915
Do you mind ifwe disturb you
forjust two minutes?

911
01:51:59,045 --> 01:52:03,924
Well, you ask me why an American writer
would want to live in Rome.

912
01:52:04,050 --> 01:52:06,635
First of all,
because I like the Romans.

913
01:52:06,761 --> 01:52:09,221
They don't give a damn
whether you're dead or alive.

914
01:52:09,347 --> 01:52:11,807
They're neutral, like the cats!

915
01:52:11,933 --> 01:52:14,101
Rome is the city of illusions.

916
01:52:14,227 --> 01:52:17,938
Not only by chance, you have here
the church, the government, the cinema.

917
01:52:18,064 --> 01:52:21,108
They each produce illusions

918
01:52:21,234 --> 01:52:23,527
like you do and like I do.

919
01:52:23,653 --> 01:52:27,197
As the world dies
from overpopulation...

920
01:52:27,323 --> 01:52:29,575
Yes, by Americans.

921
01:52:29,701 --> 01:52:32,077
...too many cars, poisons.

922
01:52:32,203 --> 01:52:36,373
And what better city than Rome,
which has been reborn so often?

923
01:52:36,499 --> 01:52:38,584
What place could be more peaceful

924
01:52:38,710 --> 01:52:42,421
to wait for the end
from pollution and overpopulation?

925
01:52:42,547 --> 01:52:46,467
It's the ideal city for waiting to see
if it will really come to an end or not.

926
01:52:46,593 --> 01:52:47,968
To the end!

927
01:53:06,529 --> 01:53:08,614
Get out! Clear the piazza!

928
01:53:08,740 --> 01:53:10,574
Why?
We weren't bothering anybody!

929
01:53:10,700 --> 01:53:12,951
Hurry up! Move! Move! Move!

930
01:53:19,667 --> 01:53:22,002
Ifyou don't mind,
I would like to say this -

931
01:53:22,128 --> 01:53:25,464
despite the recent
and incredibly permissive laws

932
01:53:25,590 --> 01:53:29,176
which protect the guilty man
more than the innocent,

933
01:53:29,302 --> 01:53:32,179
the restraining measures of
our police force are successful

934
01:53:32,305 --> 01:53:35,224
in keeping at an acceptable minimum
the outbreak of delinquency

935
01:53:35,350 --> 01:53:40,145
in a city, or in a society,
where protest movements, drugs

936
01:53:40,271 --> 01:53:42,981
and a desire for wealth

937
01:53:43,107 --> 01:53:46,151
are actually regarded
as legitimate goals.

938
01:53:46,486 --> 01:53:49,696
They were minding their own business.
You have no right to beat them!

939
01:53:49,823 --> 01:53:52,032
I'm a witness! Have you gone mad?
I'm a teacher, I'll have you know.

940
01:53:52,158 --> 01:53:55,786
They've turned our piazzas
and monuments into a rubbish dump.

941
01:53:55,912 --> 01:53:59,206
Right!
All they think about is sex.

942
01:53:59,332 --> 01:54:01,750
Don't worry, madam. They're not
really hurting them, believe me.

943
01:54:06,422 --> 01:54:09,716
He's beating the hell out of him!
He's killing him.

944
01:54:22,647 --> 01:54:24,898
- Belt him one!
- You clowns!

945
01:54:26,192 --> 01:54:30,779
Are you fighting or dancing?
I think they're engaged.

946
01:54:58,516 --> 01:55:02,477
You're nobody! You're nobody!

947
01:55:02,604 --> 01:55:05,772
You're just a lucky bastard,
that's all!

948
01:55:05,899 --> 01:55:08,442
He's a champion!
He could kill all ofyou.

949
01:55:08,568 --> 01:55:10,652
He's a real champ!

950
01:55:13,197 --> 01:55:15,949
The camera.
Somebody swiped the camera!

951
01:55:17,535 --> 01:55:19,953
Somebody stole the camera!

952
01:56:06,876 --> 01:56:11,338
This lady you see walking home along
the wall of an old patrician palazzo

953
01:56:11,464 --> 01:56:13,757
is an actress from Rome,
Anna Magnani.

954
01:56:13,883 --> 01:56:16,802
in a way, she's a symbol
ofthe city itself.

955
01:56:16,928 --> 01:56:18,011
What am I?

956
01:56:18,137 --> 01:56:21,682
Rome: she-wolf and vestal virgin,
noblewoman and fishwife,

957
01:56:21,808 --> 01:56:23,058
sombre and festive.

958
01:56:23,184 --> 01:56:25,143
I could go on
until tomorrow morning.

959
01:56:25,269 --> 01:56:27,604
You'd better go home
and get some sleep, Federico!

960
01:56:27,730 --> 01:56:31,692
- Can I ask you a question?
- No, I don't trust you. Ciao!

961
01:56:31,818 --> 01:56:32,943
Good night.
