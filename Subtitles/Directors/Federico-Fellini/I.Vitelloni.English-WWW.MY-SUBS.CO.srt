Silver Lion at the Venice Film Festival

6
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,080
This is our town pier.

7
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,440
And what you see here
is the last party of the season.

8
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,680
The Miss Mermaid contest, 1953.

9
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,280
Nice crowd, right?

10
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,280
Outsiders, tourists, and there's even
an actress who's come from Rome...

11
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,400
to be part of the jury.

12
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,800
Everybody's here.

13
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:15,080
And, of course, we're here too...
the young bucks.

14
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,080
This is Alberto.

15
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,280
This is Leopoldo, the intellectual.

16
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,320
And here's Moraldo,
the youngest member of our group.

17
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,040
Look at the lightning, it's beautiful.

18
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,240
The tenor who's singing is Riccardo.
As always, this is really his night.

19
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,760
And here's Fausto,
our leader and spiritual guide.

20
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,680
Do you believe me now?

21
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:54,200
Do you think I'm stupid?
Give me my shoe.

22
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,120
I will, but give me a kiss.

23
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,680
- Let go.
- Give me a kiss.

24
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,560
I said let go.

25
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,880
- Don't be so...
- Let go, you stupid idiot!

26
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,200
The nerve!

27
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,720
But you promised.

28
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,800
- Promised you what?
- That before you left...

29
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,760
Yes, we all make promises, how many
times have you promised Sandra?

30
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:23,240
- Who cares about Sandra?
- What? Who cares?

31
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:29,680
With four of five votes, Sandra Rubini
is Miss Mermaid, 1953.

32
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,720
My little girl!

33
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,680
You won and you didn't
even want to enter!

34
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,160
Your little sister won!

35
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,200
Well done!

36
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,160
Go, my darling! Go!

37
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,120
Miss Mermaid 1953!

38
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,080
She's thrilled!

39
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,680
Ladies and Gentlemen
may I have your attention.

40
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,120
...a famous actress who's come
all the way from Rome, Lilia Landi.

41
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,200
She places the sash of Miss Mermaid
1953 on our very own beauty queen.

42
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,280
Here it comes!

43
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,720
A few words for your admirers.

44
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,120
- I...
- Wonderful! She said "I"!

45
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,800
Could you fetch my cape?

46
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,960
Claudia!

47
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,680
Look, lightning!

48
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,960
I didn't mean to...

49
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,560
It's just a passing shower, stay in
your seats, the party isn't over!

50
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,840
Your bill, Alberto.

51
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,640
- Everyone's leaving.
- Don't mind them.

52
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,600
It's really windy!

53
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,160
- Introduce me to Landi.
- Now?

54
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,160
Please, introduce me.

55
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,600
- Thank you Madam.
- Not at all!

56
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,160
Allow me to introduce one of our
most esteemed citizens.

57
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,960
The playwright Leopoldo Vannucci.

58
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,240
How do you do?

59
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,960
I've followed your career closely.

60
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,400
He's written a play.

61
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,240
He's also our resident poet.

62
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,840
It's great out here, it feels
like the end of the world!

63
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,160
Congratulations!

64
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,360
Congratulations!

65
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,560
Well done!

66
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,640
You'll be in the movies now!

67
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,040
Thank you!

68
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,560
I want you to meet my little girl.

69
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,920
My god!

70
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,520
Moraldo!

71
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,600
- What's wrong, mum?
- Come here! Your sister's sick!

72
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,360
- Excuse me, please.
- Get a doctor, quickly!

73
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,720
A doctor! A doctor!

74
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,440
Calm down, it's nothing.
Is there a doctor here?

75
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,920
Mancinelli!

76
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,960
Calm down Mummy! It's
nothing to worry about!

77
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,840
What's going on?

78
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,400
Let me through.

79
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,320
My little girl!

80
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,760
Make Way!

81
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,640
Let them through!

82
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,920
Make Way!

83
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,880
It's nothing,
she just needs some air.

84
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,720
Poor Sandra!

85
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,960
It's nothing to worry about, Mum!

86
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,760
Leopoldo, call Fausto,
tell him to come here!

87
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,960
Fausto!

88
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,520
Calm down!

89
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,960
- It's nothing.
- Look at her!

90
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,120
May I?

91
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,000
Let me through.

92
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,880
Make Way!

93
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,520
Please Miss, make way!

94
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,880
- What happened?
- Sandra fainted, she's not well.

95
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,120
Is she better?

96
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,240
-Mum?
-Darling!

97
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,640
Oh my goodness Sandra!

98
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,240
I want to die!

99
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,920
What are you talking about?

100
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,280
You want to die tonight when
they voted you Miss Mermaid?

101
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,720
No, dear, that isn't funny.

102
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,840
Doctor, what's wrong with her?

103
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,320
Please answer!

104
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,840
Come on, everyone out!

105
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,120
Stand back!

106
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,120
I need to go through!

107
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,920
It's you.
Back already?

108
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,000
Because it's raining.

109
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,760
What are you up to?

110
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,120
I have to go away,
I'm leaving now, it's business.

111
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,080
Remember that guy I mentioned
in Milan who might have found me a job?

112
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,840
Well, I've thought about it,
I'm going to take the job.

113
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,960
At this hour?
What have you done?

114
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,040
Nothing, I got a job,
aren't you happy?

115
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,760
- What sort of job?
- It's some business he set up.

116
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,560
It's a serious offer.

117
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,320
Can you lend me 5,000 lira
for the ticket?

118
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,440
I'll pay you back when I get there.

119
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,800
What have you done this time,
you scoundrel?

120
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,040
- What have you done?
- Nothing, I got a job.

121
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,120
Don't you believe me?
I'm taking the one o'clock train.

122
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,120
Fausto!

123
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,680
Stay here, I'll go.

124
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,680
Fausto!

125
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,720
Hello, Mr. Francesco.
How are you?

126
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,080
Hi, Moraldo.
Come in.

127
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,960
Come in, come in.

128
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,680
Come in.

129
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,880
Excuse me, dad, you know...

130
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,200
You see the rain?
Summer's over.

131
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,600
- Want a smoke?
- You've only got one.

132
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,760
It doesn't matter,
I don't smoke.

133
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,680
This will go on for three days
at least.

134
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,800
Smooth, isn't it?

135
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,360
- So you're leaving?
- Yes, I'm going away.

136
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,240
- Will you be gone long?
- I don't know, it depends.

137
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,920
- And Sandra?
- She was elected Miss Mermaid.

138
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,400
She'll be fine.
I bet she's happy now.

139
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,680
Sandra's expecting.

140
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,160
Yes, I know.

141
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,200
That's why I'm leaving.

142
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,440
I'd like to do the right thing,
but how can I?

143
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,200
I'm broke, like you.
That's why I'm going to Milan.

144
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,520
I want to do something with my life.

145
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,640
Of course I'll come straight back
once I get things together.

146
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,960
Don't you believe me?

147
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,080
- I didn't say anything.
- You know what I mean.

148
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,960
I do love Sandra, I swear.
I'll swear on anything you want.

149
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,960
You want me to swear on my mother?
I really do love her.

150
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,000
It was fate.

151
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:29,040
Now be honest, wouldn't you
try to get a job first?

152
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,560
- I don't know.
- Well then?

153
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,000
Why don't you
come with me?

154
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,320
What will you do
here this winter?

155
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,600
If we don't find work in Milan
we'll look somewhere else.

156
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,560
- Didn't we always say we'd leave?
- Now?

157
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,040
I'm telling you,
this is the right time.

158
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,320
Sandra will be thrilled, you'll see.

159
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,600
Let's talk outside.

160
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,680
Quiet.

161
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,800
- Fausto?
- Let's go.

162
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,360
Turn off the light.

163
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,560
Dad?

164
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,160
Excuse me, Moraldo.

165
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,200
Can I get that 5000 lira?

166
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,960
Why do you want 5000 lira?
To do what?

167
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,920
To leave?

168
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,360
First you get into trouble then...
I'll strangle you!

169
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,520
Please...

170
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,880
Shut up!

171
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,120
What are you doing?

172
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,600
I swear I'll...
Out of my way!

173
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,640
Coward!

174
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,080
I swear on your poor mother's
grave this is the last time.

175
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,880
That girl's father is an
honourable man, like me.

176
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,080
He's worked all
his life, like me.

177
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,960
Like the fool I am,
to support his family honestly.

178
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,320
I'll take you to church myself
even if I have to drag you there.

179
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,640
Scoundrel.

180
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,960
What's happening, daddy?

181
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,960
Nothing.

182
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,400
Go back to bed.

183
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,040
You'll marry her.
Mark my words, you'll marry her.

184
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,760
Hi, Fausto.

185
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,640
Yes, go ahead and laugh
while my dad's crying.

186
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:49,160
So they got married, and it was a lovely
wedding, even if a bit hastily arranged.

187
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,080
Riccardo sang Ave Maria
and made everyone cry.

188
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,320
And the parish priest who had
known us since we were children...

189
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,360
gave a very moving speech.

190
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,840
My dear couple...

191
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,960
You've no idea what a joy it is for me
to join you in holy matrimony.

192
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,840
And you, dear Fausto,
and you, dear Sandra...

193
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,720
- You see? It didn't take a second.
- Thanks.

194
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,160
Thanks. Thanks.

195
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,640
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

196
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,560
Dad!

197
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,080
I told you I'd marry her.

198
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,680
My little girl.

199
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,560
My little girl.

200
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,720
Ciao!

201
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,600
Beautiful service!

202
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,800
Just perfect!

203
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,720
Smile for the camera!

204
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,240
Alberto, you're
covering the bride.

205
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,680
Smile please! Thank you.

206
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,760
Don't quarrel!

207
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:26,440
And be careful crossing the
streets in Rome!

208
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,680
Congratulations!

209
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,880
Goodbye!

210
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,960
Bye!

211
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,080
Bye Dad!

212
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,240
Congratulations!

213
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,040
The train is leaving!

214
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,960
Fausto! Fausto!

215
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,080
Ciao!

216
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,280
Oh dear!

217
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,600
Why are you crying?

218
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,800
It was nice, wasn't it?

219
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,960
Ciao!

220
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,800
- Riccardo.
- Coming.

221
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,440
All you do is singing!

222
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,960
Listen, Lina...

223
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,080
- Where to now?
- Let's go to Marina's.

224
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,560
- Thank you so much.
- Bye bye.

225
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:24,120
- Goodbye, Francesco.
- Thank you, Mr. Rubini.

226
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,520
You'll see, Fausto
isn't a bad kid.

227
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,320
I know.

228
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,040
This must be
your little girl.

229
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,360
She's a lovely girl.

230
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,520
Then we're agreed,
Fausto will live with us...

231
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,600
until he can support himself
and his wife.

232
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,280
Good day.

233
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,000
Why does she
treat him like that?

234
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,680
Take us home.

235
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,760
Can we buy you a drink,
Mr. Francesco?

236
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,280
No, thank you, Riccardo.
I'm going home.

237
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Good bye.

238
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,600
- Nine plus two, 11.
- 11 - 20.

239
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,320
You think you've won?

240
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,760
What do you think?

241
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,600
Two points for me,
please, Leopoldo.

242
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,800
Leopoldo?

243
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,960
- Why the long face?
- I'm feeling a bit down.

244
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,640
Forget about those two,
they've gone.

245
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,560
- I wonder if they're in Rome yet.
- What a drag!

246
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,920
Do you think it's that easy?
You've got to know Rome.

247
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,960
If he'd gone with me
it would be a different story.

248
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,400
A couple of phone calls
and we'd have a ball.

249
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,160
And Sandra?

250
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,960
- I mean if he wasn't married.
- If I got married...

251
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,600
I'd go to Africa, like Hemingway.

252
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:49,160
- Free, in the wild, in a jeep.
- That would be good.

253
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,760
On the run in Africa.

254
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,960
- I'd go with Esther Williams.
- Not Franca Marzi?

255
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,680
Franca Marzi, Ginger Rogers.

256
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,800
- Well of course...
- No, no...hang on a second

257
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,040
Remember the surveyor's girlfriend?
The one who burnt her shoulder.

258
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,120
- Ciuffini?
- Ciuffini!

259
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,800
- In Africa with Ciuffini.
- I'd go to India.

260
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:07,840
India, yes.

261
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,080
Antonio.

262
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,240
Antonio.

263
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,520
Come over.

264
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,280
Hurry up when someone calls you.

265
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,760
Antonio

266
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,720
You're always getting in the way.
What do you want?

267
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:25,280
Say what you want
but he's in Rome and we're here.

268
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,800
In this dirty village.

269
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,360
They make a nice couple.
They're good together.

270
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,240
A nice couple? She's pretty,
she's a beautiful girl...

271
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:42,000
- But Fausto, with that face?
- No, he's tall, well built.

272
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,920
- He's got a good voice.
- Voice?

273
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,160
So what?
We've all got a voice.

274
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,680
No?

275
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:54,560
Didn't you ever notice anything
with Fausto and your sister?

276
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,760
Let's be honest now,
Fausto didn't behave properly.

277
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,960
- Fausto's a scoundrel.
- No, I wouldn't call him a scoundrel.

278
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:07,640
He's a passionate creature,
driven by animal instincts.

279
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,320
What are you talking about?
You think you're writing a play?

280
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,160
He's an animal, it would be like
one of you dating my sister.

281
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,280
I'd date your sister any time.

282
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,440
Indeed!

283
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,440
Here!

284
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,760
Me! Me!

285
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,800
Come on, over here!

286
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,920
Pass the ball!

287
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,160
Oscetta

288
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,440
Oscetta

289
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,200
Alberto, leave her alone.

290
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,200
It's not fair!

291
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,520
That's enough, you scoundrels!

292
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,600
Go to bed!

293
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,840
Rascals!

294
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,200
Come on Alberto!

295
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,960
Alberto!

296
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Alberto!

297
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,280
And now what
else can we do?

298
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,320
Another day has come to an end

299
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,640
and all we can do is go home,
like every night.

300
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,280
Alberto lives with his mother
and his sister...

301
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,400
and he knows his mother won't
go to bed until he comes back.

302
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,920
It's Alberto.

303
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:36,840
Riccardo, like every night,
notices he's getting fat.

304
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:48,680
- Coming back at this hour? Rascal!
- Goodnight dad, goodnight mum.

305
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,200
And Leopoldo, after having consumed
the dinner his aunts left for him...

306
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,120
gets to work on his new play.

307
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,240
He puts on his favorite record;
'Fly Into The Night'...

308
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,280
and sits at his table.

309
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,840
Removing the cap of his pen,
he draws a triangle...

310
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,120
and watches his characters
parade across the ceiling.

311
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,840
Caterina.

312
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,800
She's the neighbours' servant.

313
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,760
Hi, Caterina.
How are you?

314
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:42,000
Not well, in this cold.
And you?

315
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,240
- I'm working.
- Yes?

316
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,280
What a lovely moon.

317
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,440
- As lovely as you.
- Liar.

318
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:57,960
- Why do you always play that song?
- It inspires me.

319
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,520
Just like every other night,
only Moraldo walks the empty streets.

320
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,280
What if I left as well?

321
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,920
Hey! Hello!

322
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,120
Hello!

323
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,600
Where are you going at this hour?
You know what time it is? It's 3:00.

324
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,240
- Aren't you going to sleep?
- Sleep? I just got up.

325
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,640
I always get up at 3:00,
every morning.

326
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,800
- Why?
- I go to work.

327
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,720
- Work?
- I work there at the station.

328
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,000
Come here, sit down.
What do you do?

329
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,560
- What kind of work?
- I told you, I work.

330
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,560
- Is this a railwayman's cap?
- Yes.

331
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,840
Tell me, are you happy?

332
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,640
It's okay.

333
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,720
- Want a cigarette? - Yes.

334
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,040
I had one here...

335
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,320
- No, I'm sorry.
- I have to go.

336
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,640
Listen...

337
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,160
- Bye
- Bye

338
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,640
- How's the helmet?
- It's coming along well.

339
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,200
- Will it fly?
- Sooner than my enemies think.

340
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:12,160
And they thought you were crazy.
I'll come and celebrate with you.

341
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,600
Olga.

342
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,760
Can you come down for a moment?

343
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,120
Do me a favour,
I'll pay you back on Sunday.

344
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,280
Give me 1000 lira.

345
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,960
- You'll pay me back?
- Yes.

346
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:39,120
You've been working all night.
He'd better give you a pay rise.

347
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,640
- I'll tell him.
- I've only got 500.

348
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,640
Yes!

349
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,560
Thanks, Olga.

350
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,560
Alberto!

351
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,800
Good morning!

352
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,720
Massimo and Leopoldo are off
to the racetrack in Bologna.

353
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,280
They gave me a sure win.
Why don't we put a bet on it?

354
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,280
1000 would cover it.
I've got 300, how much have you got?

355
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,920
Now, even on Sundays,
the beach is deserted.

356
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,960
But we'd still go there
to look at the sea.

357
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:13,000
If someone offered you 10,000 lira
would you go in?

358
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,080
I would.

359
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,080
Shall we go?

360
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,720
Let's go and watch Giudizio fishing.

361
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,200
Come on, Riccardo.

362
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,760
You know who Leopoldo
looks like? The parish priest.

363
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,320
Alberto.

364
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,880
Alberto.

365
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,760
Don't tell mum you saw me.

366
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,360
You said you were finished with him.

367
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,280
Alberto.

368
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,360
Listen.

369
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,560
Leave me alone!

370
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,280
Quit staring, guys.

371
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:00,360
Well? Shall we go and watch
Giudizio fishing?

372
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,600
Hi, Alberto.

373
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,280
- Listen here.
- You can't stay away.

374
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,960
You made me look like a fool
in front of my friends.

375
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,600
- Like your friends can talk.
- Yes.

376
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,080
You've got to break it off
with that scoundrel.

377
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,120
What do you expect?

378
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,200
Nothing.

379
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,760
- I don't expect anything.
- He's got a wife!

380
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,960
- Don't shout, mum's asleep.
- He's got a wife, he's married.

381
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:44,240
- I know, but they don't live together.
- So what? Will he marry you?

382
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,720
- Will he marry you?
- Stay out of my affairs.

383
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,880
- I can take care of myself.
- No, you can't.

384
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,240
- Because you're my sister.
- Get your hands off me.

385
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,840
If you make mum cry...

386
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,920
Get out of here!

387
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,720
If you make mum cry...

388
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,040
Then, one fine day, when we'd
almost forgotten about him...

389
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,680
- It's Massimo!
- Guys, Fausto's here!

390
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,960
Fausto is back?

391
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,760
He's got a moustache!

392
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,160
Let's go and see.

393
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,280
Here he is!

394
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,520
Fausto!

395
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,600
Hi guys!

396
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,880
- Hello!
- You are back!

397
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,440
- How are you?
- Good, thanks.

398
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,000
How is it going?

399
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:44,600
- Hi, Alberto!
- We've been waiting for you.

400
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,080
I've got something amazing
to show you.

401
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,400
Come over here!

402
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,920
- What's that?
- It's a gramophone.

403
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,200
We saw Wanda Osiris.

404
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:57,760
Yes, she wasn't bad
but let's not go overboard.

405
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:01,120
She came down this really
long staircase...

406
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,360
Quiet!
Just listen to this mambo.

407
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,880
There was a guy who danced like this.

408
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,840
- Can you teach me?
- Yes, it's easy.

409
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,080
- It's good, isn't it?
- Are you happy?

410
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,960
Yes, very.

411
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,920
Things would have gone on as usual...

412
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,440
if Fausto's father-in-law
hadn't come up with a crazy idea.

413
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,440
- Praised the Lord
- May the Lord be praised.

414
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:07,560
My dear friend,
you get younger by the day.

415
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,160
How are you?

416
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,320
This must be your son-in-law.

417
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,800
Yes he is.

418
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:17,120
My congratulations, a bit late
but it's the thought that counts.

419
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,760
You're a lucky man, I tell you.

420
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,720
Very lucky.

421
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,680
- What's your name?
- Fausto Moretti.

422
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,680
Fausto.

423
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:29,120
Listen, Fausto,
let me be absolutely candid.

424
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,400
As you can see,
this is my business.

425
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,400
- Modest, because it's modest.
- You call this modest?

426
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,960
All built through hard work.

427
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:43,880
Frankly, what I really needed was
a shop assistant or an odd-job man...

428
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,800
to do the dusting, unloading, open
and close the shop, climb shelves...

429
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,040
but I'd rather give you the job.

430
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,760
You hear that?
Thank the man.

431
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,920
- Thank you.
- There's no need.

432
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:00,800
I'm pleased to give
a young man a start in life.

433
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,760
Feel right at home.
When can you start?

434
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,400
- Right away!
- Right away?

435
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,200
So you can start learning the ropes.

436
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,960
Giulia, this is Sandra's husband.
He'll be working here now.

437
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,440
- The truck's here.
- I'll be right there.

438
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:18,120
- Shouldn't he buy one of those?
- A work coat?

439
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,560
I'll lend him my spare one for today.

440
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:23,680
It's better to wear a work coat, you know.

441
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,680
Giulia, wait a moment, please.

442
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,720
Try it on.

443
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,200
There you go.

444
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,040
Your mother will make you one.

445
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,120
It fits.

446
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,120
What is it?
It's been washed, it's clean.

447
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,440
There should be a belt.

448
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,920
Yes here it is.

449
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,400
Button it up.

450
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:45,120
Looks like it's tailor-made.
It fits a treat.

451
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,960
Now, young man, to work.

452
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,960
Go outside, a load of crates
have arrived, unload them.

453
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,280
Get the receipt from my wife.

454
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,800
Go!

455
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,240
Go on!

456
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,160
Keep an eye on them, if you're not
careful they'll break everything.

457
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,080
It's very fragile stuff.

458
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,640
- There he is.
- What's he doing?

459
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:59,360
Oh! He's handsome!

460
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,160
Come on, let's go.
You'll make him lose his job.

461
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,680
Bye Pablo!

462
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,160
Sandra, how are you?
Welcome back.

463
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,920
- You look great.
- What a pretty hat.

464
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,960
- When did you get back?
- Yesterday morning.

465
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,920
- How's married life?
- Where's Fausto?

466
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,440
He's got a job.

467
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:36,360
- I'm going to get him.
- You're wise to keep an eye on him.

468
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:40,840
Why? Fausto's a good boy.
He's just a little fickle.

469
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,280
- Do you like your new place?
- We're staying with my mother.

470
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,160
Of course, you had so little time...
Everything was so rushed.

471
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:55,640
You're hardly showing at all.
It's still a long way off, right?

472
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,280
I'm sorry, but I really have to go.

473
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,960
Let's see each other some time
with Fausto.

474
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,600
- I came to get you.
- Great!

475
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,520
Watch this.

476
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,240
- You see that?
- Bravo!

477
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,400
Are you crazy?
People can see us.

478
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,600
You're my wife, aren't you?

479
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,120
Guess what I did today.
I sold a statue this tall.

480
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,800
- Really?
- Yes.

481
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:39,400
- That's great.
- You and me are going to the cinema.

482
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,400
Fantastic!

483
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,200
- Have we got the money?
- Yes, I've got it.

484
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,920
Good girl!

485
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,640
Here! There!

486
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,760
Excuse me. Excuse me.

487
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,080
Excuse me.

488
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,080
Come here.

489
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,160
You like it here?
Can you see okay?

490
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,680
- What a lovely fridge!
- We'll get one as well.

491
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,240
How lovely!

492
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,040
Looking for your cigarettes?

493
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,000
Thanks.
I've got matches.

494
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,640
You know daddy likes you.

495
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,240
This morning mother called me,
she said Sandra, come here.

496
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,080
I went to her and she told me dad
wants to build an extension.

497
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,920
But we have to pretend
we don't know anything.

498
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,840
A light, please.

499
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,600
Thanks.

500
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,960
Welcome.

501
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,760
Then we can all be together.

502
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,960
What?

503
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:01,640
- Then we can all be together.
- Of course.

504
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:14,800
- Please don't listen to him.
- Really? Should I trust you then?

505
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,400
I've always suspected foul play.

506
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,240
- Good, aren't they?
- Yes, very.

507
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,320
Excuse me.

508
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,960
Excuse me for a moment.

509
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,360
- I'll be right back.
- Don't you feel well?

510
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,320
I'm fine, I'll be right back.

511
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,720
Lady.

512
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,960
Excuse me.

513
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,080
Good evening, lady.

514
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,200
- When can I see you?
- What do you want?

515
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,320
- Your phone number.
- Who do you want to call? Go away.

516
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,960
Don't shut the door,
I need to talk to you.

517
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,720
- Are you out of your mind?
- I know you.

518
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,120
You wore a white bathing suit
this summer, remember Alcuza?

519
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:39,120
I know you as well, you were at
the cinema with a young woman.

520
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,360
Me? No.
When will we meet again?

521
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,080
Go away.
What are you thinking? I'm a lady.

522
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,600
My maid's upstairs.

523
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:55,760
- Meet me, tomorrow night?
- No, never again.

524
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,080
- The day after tomorrow?
- No.

525
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,680
- When then?
- Until we meet again.

526
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:06,000
- Let's leave it to fate, farewell.
- No, wait!

527
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,240
I've got something important
to tell you, come here.

528
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:14,160
- I've got to speak to you.
- Go away.

529
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,080
- Sandra, you're here!
- Where have you been?

530
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:02,600
I forgot, a friend was leaving,
I went to the station.

531
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,360
Am I late?
Has the film finished already?

532
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,440
What a pity, damn it.

533
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:11,280
- How did it end? Did she die?
- No, she didn't die.

534
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:14,640
- They got married.
- She's a really good actress.

535
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:18,040
Remember we saw her in that
film in Rome, what was it called?

536
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,240
Sandra, are you crying?

537
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,920
Yes, you are.
What have I done?

538
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,360
I'm scared.

539
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,080
Scared?
Of what?

540
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,760
I don't know, I'm scared.

541
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,240
I'm sorry.

542
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,960
Don't be like that.

543
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,280
Don't worry, I'm being silly.
Something came over me.

544
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,600
No, that's not true.
Why?

545
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,920
I love you so much.

546
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,760
Give me your hand.

547
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,120
I feel better now, darling.

548
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,720
I can't stand to see you cry.

549
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,120
I won't cry anymore,
as long as you're by my side.

550
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,240
I'll always be by your side.

551
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:11,880
- Take me home.
- Yes, let's go home.

552
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,760
In the months that followed,
the most important events were...

553
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:25,960
that Riccardo, imitating Fausto, grew
a moustache and Alberto, sideburns.

554
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,520
Fausto, on the other hand,
had shaved off his moustache.

555
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:42,160
His father and sister would sometimes
pass by the shop to watch him work.

556
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:47,160
Just like every evening, Leopoldo
also worked, he grew a beard.

557
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,320
It's scary.

558
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,960
I thought you'd like it.

559
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:00,840
And, at last, the eagerly awaited
carnival season arrived.

560
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:18,320
It's a good carnival this year.
People want to enjoy themselves more.

561
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,840
- Add a beauty spot on the other side.
- No, one's enough.

562
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,760
Is my dress ready?

563
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,440
Now leave me alone or your
mother will shout at me.

564
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,760
I still have to finish all the sheets.

565
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:32,200
- No, they need to be bigger.
- I put some padding in the front.

566
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,080
Look at the state of him.

567
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,600
- Do you like Alberto?
- Nonsense.

568
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,840
- She's in love with you.
- Yes, mother's noticed as well.

569
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,600
- Is she really rich?
- Why, do you want to marry her?

570
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,280
Elvira, my hat?

571
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,800
- I haven't got your hat.
- Who's got it then?

572
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:59,760
- You're still here? I'm ready to go.
- I'm not coming.

573
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:02,160
Then give me your hat.

574
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,440
- You know I don't wear hats.
- What am I going to do?

575
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,760
You're doing it on purpose, when
someone wants to have fun no one helps.

576
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:15,320
Look in the trunk, you'll find
something, but don't make a mess.

577
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:20,000
What happened?
You're crying and she's...

578
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:24,360
- What's wrong?
- Nothing, just a slight headache.

579
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,520
You and me are going to have it out.

580
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:36,760
- Come and look, it's full of stuff.
- Just don't make a mess.

581
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:40,000
I think I've got it, watch me.

582
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,320
Who's the guy with the beard?

583
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,040
That's my poor old man.

584
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,040
Leopoldo, look at these photos.

585
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:51,440
Here's the hat.
You see? I found it.

586
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,840
Have a look.

587
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,600
Look at Alberto!

588
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,080
- Shall we dance?
- Yes, dear.

589
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,600
- We're going to dance.
- Be careful.

590
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:38,720
Have you ever seen the
rafters in this theatre?

591
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,760
No, and I have no desire to.

592
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,400
Leopoldo, wait!
I'm coming down!

593
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,440
You had the same idea
as well, China.

594
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,160
I love you so much.

595
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,600
Me too, my love.

596
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,040
- Why are you squeezing me?
- It's the Chinese way.

597
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,880
- I'm going to get a drink.
- The bar's that way.

598
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:21,360
You know what I think? One day you'll
be here applauding one of my plays.

599
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,320
I like variety shows.

600
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,680
- What are you drinking?
- An orangeade.

601
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,000
An orangeade, just a second.

602
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,240
Have you ever seen the
rafters in this theatre?

603
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:33,960
- Don't you recognise me?
- Sure!

604
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:38,640
- Are you alone?
- No, I'm with my friends.

605
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:42,600
Your costume's very pretty.

606
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,360
Excuse me.

607
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:48,000
I decided to come at the last minute.
I'll dance with you later.

608
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,360
- Gisella, wait!
- Who's he?

609
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:54,960
A great writer.
He's my neighbour, you know?

610
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:59,960
- Whiskey, darling?
- Whiskey? I want a sandwich, a big one.

611
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:03,720
- Antonio, a sandwich.
- Here you go, freshly made.

612
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:06,720
Isn't this fun?
A glass of milk.

613
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,280
Right away Sir Fausto.

614
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:11,720
A ham sandwich at this hour?

615
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:15,000
- But it's nice.
- You're always eating.

616
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,200
- I'm hungry.
- It doesn't look good!

617
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:30,960
What a nice nose you have!

618
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,000
May I dance with my sister?

619
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,440
Leave that.

620
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,640
I'll show her the rafters.

621
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:48,640
- Cognac, Giulia?
- No, I'm feeling dizzy.

622
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:50,640
Good evening.

623
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:53,240
Good evening.

624
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:59,520
- Having fun?
- Yes, lots! Aren't you?

625
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:03,920
Yes.

626
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:08,200
- They're playing the Sioux Mambo.
- Yes, it's a great song.

627
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,880
May I?

628
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,880
Actually, I'm not alone.

629
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:18,840
Let's go to the other buffet,
it's too crowded here.

630
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:25,160
Two orangeades, Antonio!
What's up with you?

631
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:27,200
- Did you see Michele's wife?
- No, who?

632
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:30,840
My boss' wife, she's a classy one.
She's my type, you know?

633
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,520
Put it on my tab.

634
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,600
No, Michele, I don't think
you're doing it right.

635
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,960
What a pro!

636
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,360
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

637
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:01,720
Where are you taking me?

638
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:09,280
- Check out the view.
- It makes me feel dizzy.

639
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,880
- Then don't look down.
- Now what?

640
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:15,200
Now, nothing.
Tomorrow we'll go for a nice walk.

641
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,600
- Yes? Who's coming?
- You are.

642
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:21,600
Let me kiss your neck.
Go on, just once.

643
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,680
How boring!

644
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:27,840
Stop.

645
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,840
That's enough.

646
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:20,520
Get out of here!
With that trumpet.

647
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:30,120
Come on, my big head.

648
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:35,080
Anita, come on let's go to mass.

649
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:50,440
Why won't you believe me?
It's true.

650
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:57,080
Alberto, what's wrong?
Feeling sick?

651
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:59,200
I'm fine.

652
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:02,680
- I'll take you home.
- I'm fine, go away.

653
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:05,240
- Go away!
- I'll take you home.

654
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:08,080
- Go to Beijing.
- Come on, let's go.

655
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:11,840
- Leave him alone.
- I can't, he's my friend.

656
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,880
- Leave me alone.
- Let's go home.

657
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:25,080
- Let's go swimming.
- Yes, but let's go home first.

658
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:28,440
- Yes, let's go home first.
- Then we'll go swimming.

659
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,760
We'll go together.

660
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,640
- Who are you?
- Moraldo.

661
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:36,680
- Who are you?
- Moraldo.

662
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:42,160
You're a nobody.
You're all nobodies, all of you.

663
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,960
What do you think you're doing?

664
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:52,080
- Nothing, nothing.
- Let go of me, you make me sick.

665
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,320
If I let you go...

666
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:58,560
- Let go, I want to go by myself.
- You'll hurt yourself.

667
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:01,840
I want to go alone, I'll be okay.
You're a nobody!

668
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,880
- You'll fall.
- You make me sick.

669
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:08,880
- Please, let's go.
- I can't just leave him.

670
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:11,840
- Can I come now?
- Then come.

671
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:16,160
- What do you want with me?
- Nothing, let's go home.

672
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:17,320
Nothing.

673
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:19,720
You know what?

674
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,440
Listen, we've got to get married.

675
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,000
Yes.

676
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:28,320
We've got to get married.
Have you seen Fausto?

677
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:32,320
He settled down.
He's happy.

678
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:36,280
He has a house.
We've got to...

679
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,440
You've got to get married, Riccardo.
You've got to get married!

680
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:46,120
- Okay, bye.
- You see? I told him as well.

681
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,960
You know what we'll do instead?
We'll leave.

682
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,280
We'll go to Brazil.

683
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:58,680
Just think, Brazil.
Let's take her as well.

684
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,680
Yes, right.

685
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:04,080
We'll take a steamer.

686
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:08,760
- I won't fall.
- Let's go home.

687
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:13,840
- You're leaving me here?
- I can't leave him, come with us.

688
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:48,840
You're home, do you want me
to take you up?

689
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:51,960
I'm not going home.
What am I going to do there?

690
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:59,920
I've was waiting for you.

691
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:01,960
I wanted to say goodbye.

692
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:05,080
I'm leaving, Alberto.
Forgive me.

693
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,720
But I can't stay here anymore.

694
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:10,280
Take care of mother.

695
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,520
I'll always think of you.

696
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:16,920
Farewell.

697
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:19,840
Farewell, Alberto.

698
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,200
Try to behave.

699
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:36,200
Olga, where are you going?

700
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:38,960
Where's she going?

701
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:12,400
Mother, what's going on?

702
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:15,960
You saw, she's gone.

703
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:19,520
How can my own daughter
do this to me?

704
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:22,440
After all I've sacrificed for her.

705
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,160
Don't cry.

706
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:33,080
I'll stay with you.
I'm not leaving.

707
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:38,120
She'll come back, you'll see.
If she doesn't, fine.

708
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:43,560
What does she think?
That those few pennies she gave us...

709
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:45,640
Good riddance!

710
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:51,240
I'll get a job, I will.

711
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:55,000
Really, Alberto?

712
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:57,920
Have you found something?

713
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:00,280
Have you found something?

714
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:02,080
No.

715
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:18,040
- Good morning.
- See what that lady wants.

716
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,560
- What lady?
- That one.

717
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:25,560
I'd like two candles
like the ones from last year.

718
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,680
I wasn't here last year.

719
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:30,000
She wants two candles
like the ones from last year.

720
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:32,200
Then get them.

721
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,560
Michele.

722
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,200
Excuse me.

723
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:40,640
- Did you enjoy yourself last night?
- Try to get here earlier.

724
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:44,560
- It's 11:00, we open at 9:00.
- Alberto's sister ran away.

725
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:47,640
It happens every morning
and you always have an excuse.

726
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:49,920
- And a toothache...
- Go.

727
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:08,680
Giulia, see what he's gone and done.

728
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,200
Sorry.
Look at the craftsmanship...

729
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:14,040
- What have you done?
- They fell.

730
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:16,800
Leave it, I'll do it.
Sorry.

731
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,840
Just paying you back.

732
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:42,360
But carnival's over, I think.

733
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:51,520
Madam Giulia.

734
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:56,200
You should always dress up
like you did last night.

735
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:17,160
Bring me the receipts in the drawer.

736
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:20,560
- Which drawer?
- The drawer under the counter.

737
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:32,640
- Here are the receipts.
- Thank you.

738
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:36,080
What are you doing?
I didn't sleep a wink.

739
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:39,000
I waltzed with you in my
dreams, all night long.

740
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,840
- Put these away.
- Give me a hand.

741
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,840
Then I'll do it myself.

742
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:47,960
What a temper! Only last night
I realised you're a real woman.

743
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:49,880
You're drunk!

744
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:54,920
Yes, drunk with you,
your flesh, your scent.

745
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:57,280
Enough of that nonsense!

746
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:59,920
Why?
Don't tell me you don't like it.

747
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:01,360
No!

748
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:07,960
Here!

749
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:14,200
Just be quiet.

750
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:17,440
It's sunny outside
but it's cold...

751
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:36,920
Good morning.
Could I see some angels, please?

752
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:49,160
- Goodnight, I'll go out this way.
- No, one moment.

753
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:55,640
Why don't you join us
for a glass of vermouth?

754
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:59,800
It's our wedding anniversary.
It's been fifteen years.

755
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:02,760
Congratulations,
but I wouldn't want to intrude.

756
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,960
No, on the contrary.

757
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:10,280
If I'd known, I would have brought
some flowers or something.

758
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:11,960
There's no need.

759
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:14,960
We live upstairs.
It's very convenient.

760
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:17,360
- Please.
- Thank you, very kind.

761
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:26,280
Allow me.

762
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:29,160
Come in.

763
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:30,920
Please.

764
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:34,520
Giulia, please bring some vermouth.

765
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:38,360
- Giulia, the vermouth.
- Yes, Michele.

766
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:40,000
Have a seat.

767
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:42,080
- It's lovely.
- You like it?

768
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:45,320
- Really lovely.
- Modest, but I like it.

769
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:48,720
- I need to get a place of my own.
- Right.

770
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:51,640
- That's an antique boat, right?
- Yes.

771
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:53,320
Here's the vermouth.

772
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:56,400
Congratulations.
I heard that today's your...

773
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:00,840
- I've got to finish up next door.
- Yes, go ahead.

774
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:03,200
Go.

775
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:08,040
- My wife's a good woman, right?
- Yes, very good and...

776
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:10,680
- And?
- Good.

777
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:12,680
Yes.

778
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:16,280
We're not so young,
but we still get along well.

779
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:21,400
We don't have many friends
so we spend most nights at home.

780
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:23,320
In this room here.

781
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:27,000
We also play cards sometimes.

782
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:32,160
Now you may laugh.
They play cards!

783
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:37,560
Or, I don't know...
I read a good book and my wife knits.

784
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:41,560
And we're not bored.
You know why?

785
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:44,680
Because we love each other.

786
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:50,440
- But you wouldn't understand.
- I understand completely.

787
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:53,160
No, you don't understand.

788
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:55,240
- Yes.
- No, you don't.

789
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:57,960
I really pity you.

790
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:03,040
And I pity your wife even
more, poor thing.

791
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:05,280
What do I mean?

792
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:09,720
Here, your month's wages.
Make up an excuse for your family.

793
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,720
Say you didn't like it, there was
too much work, whatever you want.

794
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:15,560
You're good at making up excuses.

795
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:19,200
- Why are you firing me?
- To teach you how to live.

796
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:24,920
I treated you like a brother
and you behaved like a scoundrel!

797
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:28,960
Now go away before I wring your neck.

798
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:35,920
I never expected this from you.

799
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:38,520
No, leave her out of this.

800
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:44,840
Fausto's leaving, he won't be
working for us any longer, he quit.

801
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:48,080
- Then I don't have to come tomorrow?
- No.

802
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:51,440
Good evening.

803
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,680
Look, I was just fooling around.

804
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:06,920
I lost my job.

805
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:10,080
Yes, because of that idiot
boss of mine.

806
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:11,880
Which idiot?

807
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:14,960
She fell in love with me and
because I wouldn't look at her...

808
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:17,000
Also out of respect for Michele.

809
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,120
Besides, she's an old lady,
you think I'd...

810
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:22,920
So she put me against her husband
and he made up an excuse to fire me.

811
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:24,680
What excuse?

812
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:28,400
- He can't just fire you like that.
- No, he can.

813
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:31,120
Then he said, make up an
excuse for your family.

814
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:34,800
- I have to make up an excuse.
- That's crazy, you shouldn't have left.

815
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:37,680
Didn't he give you any
severance pay or anything?

816
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,680
He should have at least
given you a month's notice.

817
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:42,760
No, he didn't.

818
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:45,320
A month at least,
he can't steal 30,000 lire.

819
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:49,120
You can't just fire someone like that.
You've got a job, a position.

820
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:03,200
Isn't water great?

821
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:09,280
Weren't you thirsty?

822
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:14,400
Listen, can you keep a secret?

823
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:17,680
I don't know.
Why?

824
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:20,880
You said Michele should have
given me notice, right?

825
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:26,080
Well I'm going to get what's mine,
then we'll split it.

826
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:28,440
I don't understand.

827
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:34,720
- You scared to climb a roof with me?
- Which roof?

828
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:36,600
A roof.

829
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:39,840
- I don't know, to do what?
- Are you scared or not?

830
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:42,320
- No.
- Come on then.

831
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:45,760
Let's go.

832
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:05,520
- Quiet.
- Move out of the way.

833
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:10,160
- Where are we?
- Quiet, don't talk.

834
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:14,600
This is the courtyard.

835
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,400
Careful with the matches,
it's all straw here.

836
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:33,800
- Where are you?
- Over here.

837
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:38,120
What are you doing?

838
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:40,800
Isn't it beautiful?

839
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:44,560
- What is it?
- It's an angel and we're taking it.

840
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:49,120
You know how much it's worth?
At least 40,000 lire, I saw the bill.

841
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:51,040
It's antique wood.

842
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:54,280
You want to steal it?
Let's get out of here.

843
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:57,800
It's not theft, no one noticed when
it was unloaded and it got left here.

844
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:00,760
It's been two months.
Didn't you say they owed me?

845
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,320
- We'll take this instead.
- It's stealing.

846
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:12,360
Listen, I have a family now,
I need this money.

847
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:15,240
I've got a lot of things
to take care of.

848
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:18,440
If you're scared, tell me.
I'll do it alone.

849
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:23,000
At least give me some light here.

850
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:31,080
Isn't it beautiful?

851
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:36,680
Beautiful.

852
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:48,320
- Tell him to be quiet.
- Giudizio, cut it out!

853
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:10,840
Good morning, sister,
is Mother Superior in?

854
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,560
What for?

855
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:14,880
I've got something that
might interest her.

856
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:17,160
What is it?
She's in the chapel.

857
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:18,760
Let's go.

858
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:21,800
No, show her.
It's a real beauty.

859
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:23,240
Show her.

860
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:30,160
It's an angel, all solid wood.

861
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:32,760
It's been in our house,
but we're forced to sell.

862
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:36,280
So we thought we'd offer it to the
Ursuline convent, it's a real bargain.

863
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:38,440
Just look at that expression.

864
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:40,720
Beautiful angel, beautiful angel!

865
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:43,840
No, don't be afraid,
he's harmless.

866
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,760
We have enough angels.

867
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:47,280
Sister, listen...

868
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:03,280
A brother, up there!

869
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:08,760
What do you want?

870
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:11,200
How are you?
Care for a cigarette?

871
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:13,440
Wait...
Catch it.

872
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:18,040
Terrific!

873
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:21,080
It's great here.
This is the life.

874
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:23,800
- Sorry, what's your name?
- Father Felice.

875
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:25,800
- Is the abbot here?
- No.

876
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:28,520
- Who's in charge when he's away?
- I am.

877
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:31,800
Great, I've got a real bargain for you.

878
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:34,960
Can I interest you in a truly
magnificent statue?

879
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:37,640
- Colourful, perfect for an altar.
- Do you have it there?

880
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:39,360
Yes.

881
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:43,960
Show him.

882
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:48,360
Beautiful angel, beautiful angel!

883
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:50,720
Isn't it beautiful?
Look at the expression.

884
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:52,840
Where did you get it?

885
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:55,080
We had it at home, we haven't
got anywhere suitable for it...

886
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:57,720
so we thought we'd offer it to you.

887
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:00,960
We don't need anything.

888
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:11,520
They were unable to sell
the statue that day...

889
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:15,280
and when evening came, Fausto and
Moraldo entrusted it to Giudizio...

890
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:17,560
with a thousand instructions.

891
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:09,360
Dad's here.

892
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:12,920
Good evening, daddy.

893
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:17,080
Moraldo, come here.
Don't make me come after you!

894
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:20,720
- What did I do?
- You really have to ask?

895
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:24,920
Out of my way!
Wait till I get hold of you!

896
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:28,440
- I haven't done anything.
- What's the poor boy done?

897
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:31,000
Poorboy?
He's a monster!

898
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:34,040
They've shamed us forever!
All of us!

899
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:36,680
Thieves!
Out of my house, both of you!

900
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:39,280
- What happened?
- They stole a statue!

901
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:42,120
- It's not like that.
- Yes it is! Be quiet.

902
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:44,960
You stole it with that layabout there.

903
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:49,000
I had to beg him not
to call the police.

904
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:52,080
Yes, the police, in my own home.

905
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:57,160
And that animal tried to force
himself on my best friend's wife.

906
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:59,160
The shame!

907
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:12,920
They told you a pack of lies and I'm
shocked someone like you believed them.

908
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:14,640
Don't raise your voice.

909
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:18,440
I will! You treat me like
a five-year old! I'm 30!

910
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:23,160
You can keep your cutlets!
You'll never see me again! Never!

911
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:45,920
Sandra, it wasn't his fault.
Giulia came on to him.

912
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:49,000
Then she lied to her husband.

913
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:54,880
- Are you listening to me?
- Really?

914
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:58,960
Yes, it was her, because Fausto
wasn't interested.

915
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:02,440
Because Fausto wouldn't
even look at her.

916
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:06,840
And they didn't want to pay him.

917
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:11,000
So we thought we'd take the angel.

918
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:16,360
- He really didn't make a pass at her?
- Yes, I swear.

919
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:20,280
Come on, don't cry.

920
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:29,840
- Where has he gone now?
- He's down in the garden.

921
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:42,200
I'm waiting for Moraldo.

922
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:45,720
Tell dad he won't see me again.
I don't want to be a burden.

923
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:49,360
What are you saying?
Moraldo told me everything.

924
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:53,920
- Everything?
- Yes, I'll tell dad.

925
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:57,240
It was that woman who
was being stupid.

926
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:03,600
- Let's not talk about it.
- No, they have to know.

927
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:08,920
Here, your cutlet.
You haven't eaten a thing.

928
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:16,280
Damn it...

929
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:19,600
Why did you take the statue?

930
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:23,600
Did you need money?
You could have told me.

931
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:27,640
Why didn't you?
We should tell each other everything.

932
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:31,920
We need to be close,
all we have is each other.

933
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:34,920
Mother's very kind but...

934
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:39,320
she treats me like a baby,
and daddy's so busy.

935
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:41,440
He doesn't even know me.

936
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:44,920
You're all I've got.
If you leave too...

937
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:55,560
Don't be like that.

938
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:03,120
- Do you still love me?
- Yes.

939
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:08,960
- Do you love our baby?
- My Sandrina, our baby.

940
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:13,720
So you'll stay with me?

941
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:15,200
Yes.

942
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:20,120
Then come on, let's go home.
Let's go see dad, come on.

943
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:29,600
So Fausto was forgiven and slowly
started looking for another job.

944
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:36,800
They didn't pay much attention to him
once the baby was born.

945
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:38,640
So handsome!

946
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:42,760
He looked like mum, dad, his aunts,
grandparents, and even Moraldo.

947
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:46,600
He looks like my maths teacher.
He's ugly! He's a martian.

948
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:51,840
Sandra was happy, and one day,
almost in secret...

949
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:55,600
she paid a visit to her father-in-law
to show him little Moraldino.

950
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:58,080
- The coffee's on the stove.
- Good girl.

951
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:01,400
Moraldino, why are you so fat?

952
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:04,720
Yesterday he said "blue",
I wonder what he meant.

953
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:07,600
Has Fausto found a job?

954
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:12,960
Yes, it looks like it.
It's just a matter of days.

955
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:17,080
Excuse me, dad,
I'll finish off the coffee.

956
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:19,800
- No, I'll go.
- No, I'll do it.

957
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:25,120
- Can I hold him?
- Yes, but be careful, don't drop him.

958
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:29,760
Handsome Moraldino,
give your auntie a kiss.

959
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:34,600
No, dad, you don't know
how to hold him.

960
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,800
Not like that!

961
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:39,960
I don't know that one.

962
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:44,600
- Is that the farthest one?
- Yes, it's called Sirius.

963
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:49,960
- Are there people living there?
- I don't think so.

964
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:52,680
- Would you live there?
- Yes.

965
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:54,920
Yes.

966
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:58,120
- Will you walk with me?
- Sure.

967
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:05,200
The evenings were getting warmer.
Spring was in the air.

968
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:33,880
And now, a man whose heart
is as big as his name.

969
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:36,240
He's brilliant.
Listen.

970
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:39,680
Mr. Sergio Natali.

971
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:52,640
I shall recite The Dreams of Youth.

972
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:54,280
- Is that Natali?
- Yes.

973
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:56,200
He's so ugly.

974
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:58,960
Grandpa, when is daddy coming home?

975
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:03,240
Little boy, your daddy has
already returned.

976
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:06,880
He's here among us,
lost in the crowd.

977
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:09,720
He sees you, he smiles at you,
he brushes past you.

978
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:12,720
And you, little boy,
you don't feel a thing.

979
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:14,800
Why not, grandpa?

980
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:18,280
Because you're innocent.

981
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:24,280
Because daddy left in the spring,
just like your grandpa.

982
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:28,040
As a lieutenant, with flowers...

983
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:32,280
songs and a flag.

984
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:46,200
It's the evening Leopoldo
has been dreaming of.

985
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:48,840
The great actor has read his play...

986
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:51,960
and will see him in his dressing room
after the performance.

987
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:05,640
His big moment has come.

988
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:08,560
Even we grasped
the importance of this meeting...

989
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:11,160
and we were as excited as Leopoldo.

990
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:26,680
I see you've brought company.
Please, come in.

991
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:31,960
- Bring some chairs.
- It's okay, sir, we'll stand.

992
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:34,000
Forgive the candle.

993
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:37,600
But they always steal the light bulbs
in these second-rate theatres.

994
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:40,400
- Don't worry about it.
- May I offer you a cigarette?

995
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:42,760
They're domestic, you know.

996
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:47,400
Because the American ones
are very dangerous.

997
01:18:47,720 --> 01:18:51,280
- I'm a great admirer.
- I saw you in I due Foscari.

998
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:54,960
You know, they cut the best parts out.

999
01:18:55,240 --> 01:18:59,560
Have a seat while I finish
removing my make-up, if I may?

1000
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:05,680
Sir, I've admired you for years.

1001
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:09,600
The first time I saw you was
in Bologna, in 1943.

1002
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:12,200
It was an unforgettable evening.

1003
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:16,360
- You introduced me to Ibsen.
- Ibsen, those were the days.

1004
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:18,440
Feels like yesterday.

1005
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:21,880
My dear friend, it's hard work
being a lead actor.

1006
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:25,880
And they see me here during a break
which I'd like to call a holiday.

1007
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:28,200
It's temporary, of course.

1008
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:33,520
My dear friend, I have some great
ideas for next season.

1009
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:37,040
I want to put together an amazing cast.

1010
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:39,640
A cast that will make history.

1011
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:42,360
I'll have Ferrati and possibly Gassman.

1012
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:44,960
You hear that?
Ferrati and Gassman.

1013
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:47,960
And I want young playwrights,
first of all, for the grants...

1014
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:49,960
and then for the challenge.

1015
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:53,400
Speaking of which,
I've read your work.

1016
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:58,240
Well, I've flicked through it.
You understand, I'm always so busy.

1017
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:00,400
The theater is a tyrant.

1018
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:02,560
But you've got it.

1019
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:05,440
You really liked it?

1020
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:09,920
You've got it here... and here.

1021
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:12,080
Sir.

1022
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:16,400
"I'm a product of my time.
I am, alas, powerless.

1023
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:19,160
Do you understand, Frida,
the writhing agony of my soul?"

1024
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:20,960
Frida laughs.

1025
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:23,080
"I understand, Roberto,
that you are consumed by pride..."

1026
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:26,000
- Salt.
- Roberto laughs.

1027
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:29,880
What more damage can pride do
to a soul already ruined?

1028
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:32,320
Blind man!
Only fear could save you."

1029
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:36,920
Blind man!
Only fear could save you.

1030
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:40,800
Brilliant! But that was Frida's line.
She goes on.

1031
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:43,800
"In the silence of your desert,
don't you hear a voice calling you?"

1032
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:46,000
Robert, sarcastically:
"Your voice, Frida?"

1033
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:48,360
"No... God's."

1034
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:52,040
So ends Act ll.

1035
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:55,640
Great!
Isn't it great?

1036
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:59,280
- Sir, may I start Act Ill?
- Continue.

1037
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:03,960
The door!

1038
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:09,160
- Did you eat well, sir?
- Great, thanks.

1039
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:12,120
- Keep reading.
- Act Ill, scene I...

1040
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:22,240
What's a Roman omelette?
The one with all the fat on top?

1041
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:27,320
Ask Mr. Natali to introduce us.

1042
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:29,400
Why?

1043
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:34,200
They'll be represented
by two figures clad in white...

1044
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:38,880
and the dark lighting will give
the scene a nightmarish quality.

1045
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:41,840
The sound of the wind will lead
into the cry of the seagulls.

1046
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,200
As if shaken by a sudden shiver,
Frida turns, she's tired, aged.

1047
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:47,040
Frida approaches Luca...

1048
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:52,600
I like you, baby, and damn you to hell
if you won't drink with me.

1049
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:57,560
- Can you do Gary Cooper?
- Alberto, do the saw!

1050
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:00,640
I do a good saw.
Close your eyes or it won't work.

1051
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:02,760
Quiet, listen!

1052
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:07,960
I'll do an impression,
my grandma!

1053
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:10,200
Granny, I'll never leave you.

1054
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:14,160
Can't you do impressions?
Why are you so serious?

1055
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:17,600
I like this dark-haired boy.
He's got class.

1056
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:19,520
Yes, it's true.

1057
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:24,880
"Even murder, nothing scares me
anymore, yet I still remember..."

1058
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:31,000
Hey, there's a radio here.
I'll turn it on.

1059
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:34,680
That's a naughty thing to say.

1060
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,120
Leopoldo, where are you going?

1061
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:09,320
I'll tell you later.
I feel poetically inspired.

1062
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:11,320
An idea worthy of a genius!

1063
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:15,320
Ocean breeze, nocturnal wind.

1064
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:19,880
- Sir, my friends...
- Your friends have disappointed me.

1065
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:24,200
He who cares not for art
cares not for life.

1066
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:26,840
Is the beach that way?

1067
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,560
Excellent!

1068
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:33,440
Your Frida is wonderful.
A perfectly sculpted character.

1069
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:36,960
Perfect for Ferrati!
Perfect!

1070
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:41,400
I'll write to her tonight
and I'm sure she'll accept.

1071
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:45,560
If Act IV is anything
like the first two...

1072
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:49,800
I assure we hold all the
cards, my boy!

1073
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:52,400
- What's your name?
- Poldo, sir.

1074
01:23:52,640 --> 01:23:56,280
Leopoldo, in two months
you must come with me to Milan.

1075
01:23:56,600 --> 01:24:00,240
- Really, sir? Are you serious?
- Call me Sergio.

1076
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:03,440
- Are you serious?
- Come, let's read Act IV.

1077
01:24:03,720 --> 01:24:06,840
You've no idea what this
means to me.

1078
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:10,240
I was ready to give up
on all my dreams.

1079
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:12,720
- The beach!
- This way.

1080
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:18,000
Sergio, I can hardly express...
This town is blind to art.

1081
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:19,840
It's hard being so misunderstood.

1082
01:24:19,960 --> 01:24:23,000
My friends don't understand me.
They only care about material things.

1083
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:25,680
They live their sordid lives,
thinking of women and money.

1084
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:29,200
I feel so alone,
and the winter's are awful.

1085
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:32,680
It's endless in this town.
I'm so full of sadness and anguish.

1086
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:36,760
At midnight the town goes dark.
How can an artist feed his demons?

1087
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:38,960
How can he live in this silence?

1088
01:24:39,160 --> 01:24:42,160
The years go by,
then one morning you wake up.

1089
01:24:42,360 --> 01:24:45,040
Yesterday you were a boy
and now you're no longer young.

1090
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:46,640
My hat!

1091
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:02,560
Sergio, where have you gone?

1092
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:15,240
The wind has died down.
Is that the pier?

1093
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:18,200
Come and read me Act IV.

1094
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:24,200
- Where are you going?
- We'll find a spot down there.

1095
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:26,840
But it's dark down there.

1096
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:35,960
Come.

1097
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:39,000
Come.

1098
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:44,040
You aren't afraid of me, are you?

1099
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:53,120
Poldo, where are you going?
I was joking!

1100
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:57,200
What did you think I meant?
Come here, Poldo!

1101
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:19,840
Bye.

1102
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:22,200
Bye,baby.

1103
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:24,960
Cover yourself, it's cold outside.

1104
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:29,760
I'll come to the station
in the morning to see you off.

1105
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:42,840
What are you doing here?

1106
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:47,960
- I was waiting for you.
- Thanks.

1107
01:26:48,160 --> 01:26:50,600
I think it's better
if we go home together.

1108
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:52,040
Sure.

1109
01:26:54,920 --> 01:26:57,200
What a woman!
Extraordinary!

1110
01:26:57,400 --> 01:27:00,960
You know what she told me?
If I could sing, she'd hire me.

1111
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:05,200
She'd take me on tour with her.
It wouldn't be a bad life.

1112
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:09,080
You travel, you're free,
you have fun, no worries.

1113
01:27:09,960 --> 01:27:12,200
Surrounded by women all the time.

1114
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:21,760
What about you?

1115
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:26,600
- Me? Nothing.
- Why? She wasn't bad-looking.

1116
01:27:27,720 --> 01:27:29,360
What's wrong?

1117
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:35,280
- Nothing, I was just thinking...
- About what?

1118
01:27:35,640 --> 01:27:37,280
About Sandra.

1119
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:41,600
What about Sandra?
Are you going to preach to me?

1120
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:45,120
So that's why you waited for me.

1121
01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:48,320
Answer me.

1122
01:27:53,160 --> 01:27:54,640
Goodnight.

1123
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:57,640
Clean yourself,
you're covered in lipstick.

1124
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:59,760
The other side.

1125
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:29,320
Sandra, aren't you asleep yet?

1126
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:32,680
- Look at that little face.
- Don't touch him!

1127
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:34,600
Why?

1128
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:40,960
- Are you crying?
- Go away, get out.

1129
01:28:43,080 --> 01:28:45,320
- Leave me alone.
- You'll wake the baby.

1130
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:48,400
What have I done?

1131
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:34,080
That morning, Sandra left the house at
dawn without saying a word to anyone...

1132
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:37,240
and at noon
she still hadn't come back.

1133
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:41,920
Here comes Riccardo with dad's car.

1134
01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:45,680
- Hi, Riccardo.
- Come on.

1135
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,440
Moraldo went to see Miss Rossi,
Sandra's old teacher.

1136
01:29:49,680 --> 01:29:52,920
- She might have gone to see her.
- That's right, Fausto.

1137
01:29:53,160 --> 01:29:55,400
I think she might be there.

1138
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:58,240
Shall we go to the school first
then her grandmother's?

1139
01:29:58,840 --> 01:30:01,440
How far is her grandmother's
because the petrol...

1140
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:13,960
What happened?
Did you quarrel?

1141
01:30:24,760 --> 01:30:26,160
Well?

1142
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:28,160
She hasn't seen her.

1143
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:32,760
Come on, get in.
Let's check out her grandmother's.

1144
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:35,600
No, you go.
I'll look for her on my own.

1145
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,960
- What happened?
- Nothing, lady.

1146
01:30:42,080 --> 01:30:44,160
Forget about him.
Let's go.

1147
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:59,040
Why don't we grab a bite to eat
before we leave town?

1148
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:01,680
We could grab a bite to eat
before we leave town.

1149
01:31:01,960 --> 01:31:03,200
Shut up!

1150
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:05,960
I've got a feeling we'll find her
at her grandmother's.

1151
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:09,280
It makes sense that she went there,
to show her the baby.

1152
01:31:09,640 --> 01:31:12,560
Yes, I agree, she went to
show her the baby.

1153
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,920
Did you have anything to eat
before you left home?

1154
01:31:18,160 --> 01:31:20,080
- Nothing?
- No, I'm not hungry.

1155
01:31:20,280 --> 01:31:22,000
- A sandwich?
- I'm not hungry.

1156
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:34,960
- Where do we turn around here?
- Let's get out.

1157
01:31:35,680 --> 01:31:39,520
- Let's ask someone.
- There's nobody here.

1158
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:41,920
There's a house down there.

1159
01:31:42,520 --> 01:31:45,320
There's no one there.
This is a wasteland.

1160
01:31:48,760 --> 01:31:50,440
Fausto, where are you going?

1161
01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:54,280
- Watch Leopoldo.
- Go on!

1162
01:31:57,720 --> 01:32:00,600
- You could have hit me.
- It wasn't me, it was him.

1163
01:32:01,560 --> 01:32:03,880
Quiet.
Do you hear the lark?

1164
01:32:04,680 --> 01:32:06,400
- What?
- The lark.

1165
01:32:06,640 --> 01:32:10,160
- That's a robin.
- Robins sound like this...

1166
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:14,840
What sound does it make?

1167
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:16,840
Robins sound like this...

1168
01:32:31,200 --> 01:32:35,040
But Sandra wasn't at her grandmother's
either and Fausto was getting scared.

1169
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:36,960
Riccardo!

1170
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:40,280
- We have to go back right away.
- The car won't start.

1171
01:32:40,440 --> 01:32:42,280
We're out of fuel.

1172
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:47,760
- Can I borrow that bicycle?
- Yes, take it.

1173
01:32:47,960 --> 01:32:50,440
It's Caesar's but he doesn't
need it today, be careful.

1174
01:32:50,680 --> 01:32:53,320
- Would you like something to eat?
- Where are you going?

1175
01:32:53,560 --> 01:32:56,440
- Let me go.
- Listen, Sandra's at home.

1176
01:32:56,680 --> 01:32:59,920
I'll bet you anything that
she's at home.

1177
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:03,720
- Now you're scared, what about before?
- Out of my way, idiot!

1178
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:06,080
Worry about that sister of yours
who never came back!

1179
01:33:06,280 --> 01:33:09,280
Coward!
Asshole!

1180
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:11,400
Animal.

1181
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:16,680
- You mentioned an omelette?
- Yes.

1182
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:18,720
- With bacon?
- Yes.

1183
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:20,640
Leave me alone.

1184
01:33:21,080 --> 01:33:22,560
With bacon?

1185
01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:37,200
Sandra!

1186
01:33:45,240 --> 01:33:48,120
- Where is everyone?
- They've gone to the police station.

1187
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:50,720
They're looking for her in the sea.

1188
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:54,640
Why the sea?

1189
01:33:54,840 --> 01:33:57,920
- Why the sea?
- How do I know?

1190
01:34:02,680 --> 01:34:06,000
What should I do?
Shall I prepare lunch?

1191
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:15,960
You!

1192
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:19,040
You see?
We meet again.

1193
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:21,520
It's fate.

1194
01:34:21,880 --> 01:34:24,400
What's wrong?
Why haven't you shaved?

1195
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:27,080
Where are you going in such
a hurry? The cinema?

1196
01:34:27,280 --> 01:34:29,240
I'm going home.

1197
01:34:29,680 --> 01:34:32,960
Would you be a gentleman
and carry this for me?

1198
01:34:33,160 --> 01:34:36,200
No, I'm sorry, I can't.

1199
01:35:08,200 --> 01:35:09,960
Is she back?

1200
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:15,760
If she doesn't come back
I'll kill myself.

1201
01:35:16,720 --> 01:35:20,440
You'll never kill yourself,
you're a coward.

1202
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:26,520
Moraldo, listen...

1203
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:54,400
Mr. Michele.

1204
01:35:58,680 --> 01:36:00,360
What's wrong?

1205
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:03,640
Sandrina's disappeared.

1206
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:14,760
Workers!

1207
01:36:18,520 --> 01:36:20,840
Stupid workers!

1208
01:36:24,040 --> 01:36:26,960
- What's up with this car?
- Why are you stopping?

1209
01:36:27,200 --> 01:36:29,800
- Open the hood.
- Do something.

1210
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:33,080
Let me out.

1211
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:41,200
They're coming.

1212
01:36:41,800 --> 01:36:43,560
We were joking!

1213
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:49,640
What happened?

1214
01:36:51,880 --> 01:36:53,960
Me?
It was them, I was asleep.

1215
01:36:54,160 --> 01:36:55,880
I'm a socialist.

1216
01:37:08,080 --> 01:37:10,320
- Are you looking for Sandra?
- Yes.

1217
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:13,360
She's here,
she's been with us all day.

1218
01:37:24,640 --> 01:37:25,960
Stop right there!

1219
01:37:29,200 --> 01:37:31,920
Sandra, do me a favour,
take the baby in the other room.

1220
01:37:32,120 --> 01:37:35,240
- Dad, it's alright.
- Please, go next door.

1221
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:43,840
- Go next door with Sandra.
- No, dad, let me stay.

1222
01:37:46,200 --> 01:37:48,200
What a day!

1223
01:37:57,880 --> 01:38:00,120
What are you doing?

1224
01:38:00,360 --> 01:38:02,880
- You hear that?
- No, I can't hear a thing.

1225
01:38:03,160 --> 01:38:07,240
- He's beating him, let me go in!
- No, it's just men talking.

1226
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:09,440
He'll hurt him!

1227
01:38:10,640 --> 01:38:12,960
Leave them be,
they're just playing.

1228
01:38:16,920 --> 01:38:19,240
Let me go in.
Can't you hear them yelling?

1229
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:22,920
- Don't worry, it's nothing.
- Mirellina, he'll kill him!

1230
01:38:28,520 --> 01:38:31,400
- He's beating him to a pulp.
- No, he isn't hurting him.

1231
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:33,800
On the contrary...

1232
01:38:35,040 --> 01:38:38,440
Hold him for a moment,
I have to go in there.

1233
01:38:39,120 --> 01:38:40,880
Daddy, stop!

1234
01:38:59,960 --> 01:39:03,120
May I?
My name's Michele Corti.

1235
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:06,160
It's an honour.

1236
01:39:06,680 --> 01:39:09,640
- You really gave me a scare.
- Did he hurt you?

1237
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:12,160
No.
Are you okay?

1238
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:24,800
Goodnight, dad.

1239
01:39:37,720 --> 01:39:40,920
I was so scared.
Don't you do that again.

1240
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,960
If you make me mad again
I'll beat you like your father.

1241
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:47,040
Even worse.

1242
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:49,760
I'll beat you senseless.

1243
01:39:50,320 --> 01:39:52,200
That's how I like you!

1244
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:55,760
Let me hold him.

1245
01:39:58,200 --> 01:40:01,000
- Don't let him catch a cold.
- Mirella's by the window.

1246
01:40:01,200 --> 01:40:02,800
Bye, Mirella.

1247
01:40:09,960 --> 01:40:13,280
Fausto and Sandra's story
ends here for now.

1248
01:40:14,120 --> 01:40:16,880
As for Leopoldo, Alberto,
Riccardo...

1249
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:21,080
and the rest of us,
you can imagine what happened.

1250
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:23,960
We always talked about leaving...

1251
01:40:24,240 --> 01:40:28,360
but only one of us, one morning,
without saying a word to anyone...

1252
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:30,880
actually left.

1253
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:10,640
- Are you leaving?
- Guido.

1254
01:41:11,160 --> 01:41:13,400
- Yes, I'm leaving.
- Where are you going?

1255
01:41:15,080 --> 01:41:18,560
- I don't know, I'm leaving.
- All aboard!

1256
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:27,080
- What are you going to do?
- I don't know, I have to go.

1257
01:41:27,360 --> 01:41:30,200
- I'm leaving.
- Didn't you like it here?

1258
01:41:32,840 --> 01:41:34,240
Goodbye, Moraldo!

1259
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:39,800
Farewell, Guido.

1260
01:42:39,240 --> 01:42:42,040
The End.

1261
01:42:43,040 --> 01:42:46,960
