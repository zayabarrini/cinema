1
00:03:41,727 --> 00:03:43,896
Counselor, I've got him.

2
00:03:48,442 --> 00:03:50,528
Down. Come down.

3
00:03:57,368 --> 00:03:58,577
Down for good.

4
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:06,460
Forgive the early intrusion.

5
00:04:06,544 --> 00:04:07,962
How are you?

6
00:04:08,045 --> 00:04:11,507
I'm a great fan of yours.
Very pleased to meet you.

7
00:04:12,091 --> 00:04:13,426
May I?

8
00:04:14,051 --> 00:04:17,179
May I use your typewriter, sir?

9
00:04:17,263 --> 00:04:19,432
Your arm, please.

10
00:04:19,974 --> 00:04:21,392
Relax it.

11
00:04:21,892 --> 00:04:24,228
- Your age?
- Forty-three.

12
00:04:24,311 --> 00:04:25,896
Now lean forward.

13
00:04:27,481 --> 00:04:31,986
What are you cooking up for us now?
Another film with no hope?

14
00:04:32,069 --> 00:04:34,697
- First time taking the cure?
- Yes.

15
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:38,826
Take a deep breath.

16
00:04:39,702 --> 00:04:40,703
Come in.

17
00:04:42,663 --> 00:04:44,540
Sorry. I'll come back later.

18
00:04:44,623 --> 00:04:45,791
No, come in.

19
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:47,501
Breathe.

20
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:51,213
Deepen.

21
00:04:53,215 --> 00:04:54,925
Good morning.

22
00:04:55,009 --> 00:04:56,969
Mind if I smoke?

23
00:05:00,514 --> 00:05:02,016
Cough.

24
00:05:03,976 --> 00:05:05,311
Breathe in.

25
00:05:06,979 --> 00:05:09,440
- Did you read it?
- Yes.

26
00:05:10,274 --> 00:05:11,901
Breathe.

27
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,905
So, what do you think?

28
00:05:17,656 --> 00:05:21,535
I made some notes, but we'll talk later.

29
00:05:22,536 --> 00:05:26,457
Your system is a bit overworked.
You may get dressed.

30
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:31,003
Nice-looking girl. American, right?

31
00:05:31,086 --> 00:05:33,130
You've got some fine merchandise here.

32
00:05:33,214 --> 00:05:35,299
This treatment will do you good.
You'll see.

33
00:05:36,175 --> 00:05:40,930
Nurse, 300 milliliters of holy water,

34
00:05:41,013 --> 00:05:44,183
three doses at 15-minute intervals
on an empty stomach.

35
00:05:45,059 --> 00:05:48,812
- A mud bath every other day...
- What time is it?

36
00:05:48,896 --> 00:05:52,900
Followed by ten minutes
in the mineral water as prescribed.

37
00:05:54,026 --> 00:05:57,696
- I'll wait for you at the springs.
- Yes, thank you.

38
00:09:09,263 --> 00:09:10,556
Sir.

39
00:09:11,807 --> 00:09:13,434
Sir, your glass.

40
00:09:24,611 --> 00:09:25,863
Over here.

41
00:09:26,905 --> 00:09:29,324
- You want to talk about the film?
- Yes, of course.

42
00:09:29,408 --> 00:09:34,204
Fine. Just tell me if you'd like
the producer to see my report.

43
00:09:34,288 --> 00:09:37,499
Frankly, I wouldn't want
to cause you any trouble.

44
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:39,668
No, don't worry.
I'm the one who called you in.

45
00:09:40,377 --> 00:09:42,671
On first reading, it's evident

46
00:09:42,755 --> 00:09:47,509
that the film lacks a central conflict,
or philosophical premise, if you will...

47
00:09:47,593 --> 00:09:48,802
Shall we sit down?

48
00:09:48,886 --> 00:09:52,973
Making the film
a series of gratuitous episodes,

49
00:09:53,056 --> 00:09:57,978
perhaps even amusing
due to their ambiguous realism.

50
00:09:58,437 --> 00:10:01,774
One wonders what the author's point is.

51
00:10:01,857 --> 00:10:05,027
To make us think? To scare us?

52
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:10,324
From the start, the action reveals
an impoverished poetic inspiration.

53
00:10:11,158 --> 00:10:15,788
Forgive me, but this might be
the most pathetic demonstration ever

54
00:10:15,871 --> 00:10:20,959
that cinema is irremediably behind
all other arts by 50 years.

55
00:10:21,043 --> 00:10:24,880
The subject matter doesn't even have
the merits of an avant-garde film,

56
00:10:24,963 --> 00:10:27,674
while possessing all its shortcomings.

57
00:10:28,383 --> 00:10:32,721
Here are my notes.
I doubt they will be helpful.

58
00:10:34,515 --> 00:10:38,060
It's still a mystery
that you'd think of me

59
00:10:38,143 --> 00:10:42,981
for a collaboration
that I frankly don't think could work.

60
00:10:43,065 --> 00:10:46,860
No, on the contrary.
You'll be most helpful.

61
00:10:47,319 --> 00:10:51,281
You see, I really want to make this film.

62
00:10:51,365 --> 00:10:55,369
I only postponed the shoot
for two weeks because...

63
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:02,501
Mezzabotta!

64
00:11:03,335 --> 00:11:04,545
Excuse me.

65
00:11:07,548 --> 00:11:10,592
Mezzabotta! Mario! You're here too?

66
00:11:10,676 --> 00:11:12,135
Guido!

67
00:11:12,219 --> 00:11:13,804
Well, Well!

68
00:11:14,805 --> 00:11:17,891
Mario, what's wrong?

69
00:11:19,434 --> 00:11:21,645
Guido, baby, how are you?

70
00:11:21,728 --> 00:11:24,147
You've sprouted quite a few gray hairs,
old Snaporaz!

71
00:11:24,231 --> 00:11:25,357
And you haven't?

72
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,568
Are you drinking that garbage?
It's bad for you.

73
00:11:27,651 --> 00:11:31,405
They said my liver isn't —
And, you, what's your treatment?

74
00:11:33,365 --> 00:11:35,075
Just a second.

75
00:11:35,784 --> 00:11:37,160
Gloria.

76
00:11:37,244 --> 00:11:39,788
Your daughter? She's all grown up.

77
00:11:39,872 --> 00:11:41,874
- No, she's not my daughter.
- How awful.

78
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:47,129
The cruel bee has sucked all the life
from these poor flowers.

79
00:11:47,671 --> 00:11:50,173
Darling, this is my friend...

80
00:11:50,257 --> 00:11:51,383
I'm sorry. My shoes.

81
00:11:52,634 --> 00:11:55,262
- Gloria Morin.
- Nice to meet you.

82
00:11:56,179 --> 00:11:57,180
I'm fine, thank you.

83
00:11:57,264 --> 00:12:01,351
I know all about you.
Pupi always tells me.

84
00:12:01,435 --> 00:12:05,314
We even had a big fight when I was
very critical of your last film.

85
00:12:05,397 --> 00:12:07,816
That's not true. You liked it a lot.

86
00:12:08,984 --> 00:12:11,361
Shall we get something to drink?
Come on.

87
00:12:13,614 --> 00:12:15,824
Are you here alone? And your wife?

88
00:12:15,908 --> 00:12:18,243
- Yes, I'm alone.
- Better that way.

89
00:12:18,327 --> 00:12:20,329
I mean, better in general.

90
00:12:20,829 --> 00:12:23,749
- You heard about Tina and me?
- Tina?

91
00:12:23,832 --> 00:12:25,959
We're waiting for an annulment.

92
00:12:26,627 --> 00:12:29,463
That's why we're here together.
We're engaged.

93
00:12:30,505 --> 00:12:32,090
Congratulations.

94
00:12:32,174 --> 00:12:35,302
So, Guido, baby,
cooking up something good?

95
00:12:35,385 --> 00:12:36,779
Sure is the ideal place
to do some thinking.

96
00:12:36,803 --> 00:12:39,181
This is the writer Daumier. This is Miss —.

97
00:12:39,264 --> 00:12:41,141
Pardon me, but your name again?

98
00:12:42,851 --> 00:12:45,812
Nice to meet you.
I'm a great fan of yours.

99
00:12:45,896 --> 00:12:47,648
I'm flattered.

100
00:12:47,731 --> 00:12:51,151
Are you an actress?
Have I seen your pictures somewhere?

101
00:12:51,234 --> 00:12:52,986
An actress? Yes.

102
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:55,864
I have ambitions along those lines.

103
00:12:55,948 --> 00:12:58,742
Actually, enormous ambitions,

104
00:12:58,825 --> 00:13:00,994
but that's all they are for the moment.

105
00:13:01,078 --> 00:13:04,581
She has a degree in philosophy.
Allow me <i>—</i> Mario Mezzabotta.

106
00:13:04,665 --> 00:13:08,460
I don't have a degree. I'm doing
my thesis. It's a little different.

107
00:13:08,543 --> 00:13:11,630
- And the subject?
- A difficult one.

108
00:13:11,713 --> 00:13:15,801
The solitude of modern man
in contemporary theater.

109
00:13:15,884 --> 00:13:17,636
Interesting subject. Right, Professor?

110
00:13:18,553 --> 00:13:20,889
<i>And what is the meaning
behind the capricious apparitions</i>

111
00:13:20,973 --> 00:13:23,266
<i>of the girl at the springs?</i>

112
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:25,978
<i>An offer of purity,
of warmth to the protagonist?</i>

113
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:31,316
<i>Of all your story's overabundant symbols,
this is the worst, and —.</i>

114
00:14:19,573 --> 00:14:21,992
She didn't come. Just as well.

115
00:14:42,471 --> 00:14:45,849
- Yak! How are you?
- Not too bad.

116
00:14:45,932 --> 00:14:47,493
- Did anybody recognize you?
- I don't think so.

117
00:14:47,517 --> 00:14:48,769
You brought all that luggage?

118
00:14:48,852 --> 00:14:53,023
It's just five suitcases.
Gowns take up so much space.

119
00:14:53,106 --> 00:14:56,443
I brought one... You'll see.
Did you get it all?

120
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:59,863
Carla, people go to bed early here.
There's nothing going on.

121
00:14:59,946 --> 00:15:03,450
But it's a fashionable spa.
There must be some fashion shows.

122
00:15:03,533 --> 00:15:05,994
Our hotel probably has
a little nightclub, right?

123
00:15:06,912 --> 00:15:08,622
- Have you been a good boy?
- Yes.

124
00:15:08,705 --> 00:15:12,709
Listen, I couldn't actually
get you a room in my hotel.

125
00:15:12,793 --> 00:15:14,753
Besides, it's full of people who know me.

126
00:15:14,836 --> 00:15:19,216
So I found some place else.
A wonderful hotel. Very charming.

127
00:15:19,299 --> 00:15:20,801
What do you mean?

128
00:15:21,718 --> 00:15:23,470
And how's this guy?

129
00:15:23,553 --> 00:15:26,306
<i>SEND? Great.</i>

130
00:15:27,057 --> 00:15:29,059
You look a little pale. How come?

131
00:15:29,476 --> 00:15:31,978
See, the hotel's right there.

132
00:15:33,855 --> 00:15:35,899
Signora, guests.

133
00:15:35,982 --> 00:15:40,153
As I said, it's not...
But it's very quiet.

134
00:15:40,237 --> 00:15:42,989
If you're hungry,
I'll have some sandwiches brought up.

135
00:15:43,073 --> 00:15:45,075
It's a little gloomy down here.

136
00:15:45,158 --> 00:15:47,202
No, it's picturesque.

137
00:15:47,285 --> 00:15:49,496
And I'm hungry.
You had lunch, but I didn't.

138
00:15:49,579 --> 00:15:51,206
Hello, sir.

139
00:15:52,999 --> 00:15:54,126
How's the solitaire?

140
00:15:54,209 --> 00:15:56,378
Everything's ready <i>—</i>
The room, the bathroom.

141
00:15:56,461 --> 00:15:58,630
Rest assured. Signora will feel at home.

142
00:15:58,713 --> 00:16:01,299
Thank you.
Would you have anything to eat?

143
00:16:01,383 --> 00:16:03,426
- The bathroom?
- Over there.

144
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:05,554
I'll see to it personally.

145
00:16:06,429 --> 00:16:09,057
The train is horrible.
It leaves your hands so black.

146
00:16:09,891 --> 00:16:12,018
- Happy I'm here?
- Of course.

147
00:16:12,102 --> 00:16:15,564
- Very happy or a little happy?
- Really happy.

148
00:16:17,899 --> 00:16:19,192
What a nice smell!

149
00:16:19,276 --> 00:16:23,113
I was sure this black velvet
was going to wrinkle.

150
00:16:23,196 --> 00:16:24,781
Really? Good.

151
00:16:24,865 --> 00:16:27,951
But not a crease,
even after a three-hour trip.

152
00:16:33,248 --> 00:16:37,085
You didn't even say if you like it.
Don't you like it?

153
00:16:37,169 --> 00:16:38,545
What a beautiful lady.

154
00:16:42,174 --> 00:16:43,550
So elegant.

155
00:16:43,633 --> 00:16:45,719
That thing on her head — <i>Is it "pelushe"</i>?

156
00:16:46,136 --> 00:16:47,596
That's right. Plush.

157
00:16:49,973 --> 00:16:53,727
It took forever to find it.
I was quite desperate.

158
00:16:54,269 --> 00:16:57,063
But you know me.
When Carla sets her mind to something —.

159
00:16:57,147 --> 00:16:58,982
- Snarp!
- Sgulp!

160
00:16:59,858 --> 00:17:03,445
I read a good <i>Donald Duck</i> last week.
There was a dinosaur —.

161
00:17:03,528 --> 00:17:07,115
Here they are, my little sweet buns.

162
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,326
Guido, be good.

163
00:17:09,409 --> 00:17:11,494
What do you have in mind?

164
00:17:11,578 --> 00:17:14,122
- Have you really been a good boy?
- Of course.

165
00:17:14,998 --> 00:17:17,167
Anyway, Sweet-buns is hungry.

166
00:17:18,001 --> 00:17:19,085
Oh, my wedding ring.

167
00:17:19,711 --> 00:17:22,547
Listen, Guido,
about that little thing you promised...

168
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:24,466
What little thing?

169
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:28,595
Just wait.
Now she'll bring up her husband again.

170
00:17:29,137 --> 00:17:32,933
Don't think so? You'll see, old Snaporaz.

171
00:17:34,267 --> 00:17:37,270
Poor Luigi doesn't seem happy at all.

172
00:17:37,354 --> 00:17:40,815
You know, my husband's not the pushy type.

173
00:17:40,899 --> 00:17:43,193
That sort of thing depresses him.

174
00:17:43,276 --> 00:17:46,196
He's not stupid, you know.
He's actually very smart.

175
00:17:46,988 --> 00:17:49,157
It's so hot here.

176
00:17:50,367 --> 00:17:52,661
He knows all of Roman history by heart.

177
00:17:52,744 --> 00:17:55,288
He just needs a push.

178
00:17:55,372 --> 00:17:57,749
He's still working at the fuel company
for the same salary.

179
00:17:57,832 --> 00:17:59,125
Really?

180
00:17:59,209 --> 00:18:01,336
Careful with that purse. You'll break it.

181
00:18:01,419 --> 00:18:05,173
I love that little purse.
He gave it to me.

182
00:18:07,092 --> 00:18:09,344
Why don't you find him a job?

183
00:18:10,345 --> 00:18:13,765
You know so many people.
You've promised so many times.

184
00:18:15,642 --> 00:18:17,727
I even had a dream about it.

185
00:18:17,811 --> 00:18:20,021
I dreamed that you found him a job,

186
00:18:20,105 --> 00:18:23,108
but he lost his mind and killed us both.

187
00:18:23,191 --> 00:18:25,235
- Who?
- You and me.

188
00:18:26,194 --> 00:18:27,779
You know where we were?

189
00:18:29,197 --> 00:18:30,877
That little street behind Via della Croce,

190
00:18:30,949 --> 00:18:35,203
where I bought you
the same tie your wife did, remember?

191
00:18:35,287 --> 00:18:38,915
I never knew
if you were wearing hers or mine.

192
00:18:39,874 --> 00:18:43,753
There we were, on a cot,
in each other's arms, naked...

193
00:18:45,213 --> 00:18:49,050
and he came in
and killed us both with a broom.

194
00:18:53,638 --> 00:18:55,223
Make it a little darker.

195
00:18:56,891 --> 00:18:58,601
That's it.

196
00:18:59,269 --> 00:19:01,479
Now go out in the hallway for a minute,

197
00:19:01,563 --> 00:19:05,483
Then pretend
you've entered a stranger's room.

198
00:19:05,567 --> 00:19:07,736
What fun! We've never done this one.

199
00:19:07,819 --> 00:19:09,821
Hold it there. Let me look at you.

200
00:19:10,613 --> 00:19:13,783
No, your makeup has to be more...

201
00:19:17,078 --> 00:19:18,330
More what?

202
00:19:18,413 --> 00:19:19,789
More slutty.

203
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:23,918
Come here. Give me your eyeliner.

204
00:19:29,299 --> 00:19:31,259
Nice lamp.

205
00:19:31,343 --> 00:19:33,470
- I'd like one for my place.
- Don't move.

206
00:19:33,553 --> 00:19:36,222
- What's this hotel called?
- The Railway Hotel.

207
00:19:36,681 --> 00:19:39,684
I'll write my husband
to send me an express letter right away.

208
00:19:39,768 --> 00:19:42,645
He writes such nice letters.
I'll let you read them.

209
00:19:42,729 --> 00:19:44,522
Fine, but keep still.

210
00:19:45,065 --> 00:19:46,858
Make a slutty face.

211
00:19:50,153 --> 00:19:51,404
Go out in the hallway.

212
00:19:51,488 --> 00:19:55,492
So I'm playing a part now, huh?
Think I'm one of your actresses?

213
00:19:56,201 --> 00:19:59,079
Don't think I could do what they do?

214
00:19:59,162 --> 00:20:02,165
Anyway, I wouldn't want a life like that.

215
00:20:02,499 --> 00:20:04,584
I like staying home.

216
00:20:04,667 --> 00:20:06,669
Go on. I'm sleeping now.

217
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:13,426
Tell me, if I did
something like this for real,

218
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:15,136
would you be jealous?

219
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,639
Why? Would you really?

220
00:20:19,474 --> 00:20:20,850
Who knows?

221
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,522
- Do you need something?
- No, I just stepped outside.

222
00:20:25,605 --> 00:20:28,817
- Shall I run you a bath?
- No, I was just —.

223
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,861
- A glass of water perhaps?
- No, thank you.

224
00:20:34,155 --> 00:20:35,615
What did she want?

225
00:20:36,241 --> 00:20:39,327
The innkeeper wanted
to give me a glass of water.

226
00:20:40,036 --> 00:20:41,538
Come here.

227
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:43,873
Come on.

228
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:47,502
Open up the sheet.

229
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:51,923
Guido, do you love me?

230
00:20:52,006 --> 00:20:53,425
Yes, yes.

231
00:21:21,703 --> 00:21:23,204
Is that you, Mama?

232
00:21:25,915 --> 00:21:28,793
So many tears, my son.

233
00:21:28,877 --> 00:21:31,129
Papa, wait! Don't go.

234
00:21:31,754 --> 00:21:34,257
We've talked so little.

235
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:40,972
Papa, I had so many questions to ask you.

236
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:46,436
I can't answer them yet.

237
00:21:47,145 --> 00:21:50,106
See how low this ceiling is?

238
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:54,736
I would have liked it higher.
It's ugly, my son.

239
00:21:54,819 --> 00:21:56,988
I'd have wanted something different.

240
00:21:57,071 --> 00:22:00,158
Couldn't you take care of it?

241
00:22:00,241 --> 00:22:03,328
You used to draw so well. I'd like —.

242
00:22:03,411 --> 00:22:06,789
Oh, the <i>commendatore</i>.
He shouldn't have taken the trouble.

243
00:22:11,002 --> 00:22:12,253
Hello.

244
00:22:12,337 --> 00:22:15,089
My respects. He has very little time.

245
00:22:18,426 --> 00:22:21,679
How is he doing, this son of mine?

246
00:22:21,763 --> 00:22:25,391
Careful. Don't let him play
on your emotions.

247
00:22:26,768 --> 00:22:29,479
What? He isn't doing well?

248
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:33,566
It's so hard,
realizing that one has been so mistaken.

249
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:34,943
But I —.

250
00:22:39,948 --> 00:22:43,785
Mother prepared
a little something for you.

251
00:22:43,868 --> 00:22:46,371
Some cheese and two peaches.

252
00:22:46,454 --> 00:22:48,414
Don't worry about me.

253
00:22:48,498 --> 00:22:51,167
Sure, this place gets a little lonely,

254
00:22:51,251 --> 00:22:53,545
but your mother comes every day.

255
00:22:53,628 --> 00:22:55,797
She keeps me company, you know.

256
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,049
And she keeps everything in order.

257
00:22:58,132 --> 00:23:02,262
A little decorum is always necessary.
That's how we were brought up.

258
00:23:02,345 --> 00:23:05,890
- Everything fine with your wife?
- Luisa. Yes —.

259
00:23:05,974 --> 00:23:09,644
You two have been my joy.
Goodbye, son.

260
00:23:14,649 --> 00:23:18,778
What is this place?
Why do you like it here?

261
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,948
I haven't figured it out yet.

262
00:23:22,657 --> 00:23:24,367
But it's going better.

263
00:23:25,326 --> 00:23:27,287
Much better.

264
00:23:27,829 --> 00:23:32,542
You know, son, at first...

265
00:23:35,003 --> 00:23:39,507
Guido, I do my best.
What more can I do?

266
00:23:50,184 --> 00:23:53,354
Poor Guido, you must be tired.
Shall we go home?

267
00:23:54,939 --> 00:23:57,108
I'm Luisa, your wife.
Don't you recognize me?

268
00:23:57,191 --> 00:23:58,693
What are you thinking about?

269
00:24:31,726 --> 00:24:32,935
Good day.

270
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:52,330
Good day.

271
00:25:20,149 --> 00:25:22,985
Guido, in a few days,
I'll get you an introduction

272
00:25:23,069 --> 00:25:25,697
so you can get all the advice you need.

273
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,490
Nice mystical figure, right?

274
00:25:27,573 --> 00:25:29,367
I brought you the three old men.

275
00:25:29,784 --> 00:25:31,703
A Russian, a retired general —.

276
00:25:31,786 --> 00:25:34,288
- What old men?
- For the role of the father.

277
00:25:34,372 --> 00:25:36,791
Cover me, Cesarino.

278
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:41,421
Come here, buffoon.

279
00:25:41,504 --> 00:25:45,550
How are you?
So nice to see you, Super Tarzan!

280
00:25:45,633 --> 00:25:49,345
- I've called you six times.
- Yes, about a script for Claudia.

281
00:25:49,429 --> 00:25:51,723
- Well?
- I thought I'd mail it to you.

282
00:25:51,806 --> 00:25:53,975
- In fact, it's practically in the mail.
- Really?

283
00:25:54,058 --> 00:25:56,036
You're as young as ever.
Why aren't you still acting?

284
00:25:56,060 --> 00:26:00,732
I was up all night
with an idea for the spaceship...

285
00:26:00,815 --> 00:26:03,359
Conocchia, don't grab my arm! I hate it!

286
00:26:03,443 --> 00:26:05,319
And put on a jacket!

287
00:26:05,903 --> 00:26:07,989
Now I need tails to talk to you!

288
00:26:08,072 --> 00:26:10,283
How are you? How was your trip?

289
00:26:10,366 --> 00:26:12,910
Fine. It's been an hour.

290
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,414
What a dazzling vision!

291
00:26:16,497 --> 00:26:18,541
<i>Bellissima!</i>

292
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:22,754
- Really?
- Yes.

293
00:26:22,837 --> 00:26:24,839
You're always calling me <i>bellissima</i>,

294
00:26:24,922 --> 00:26:27,425
but you never tell me about my part.

295
00:26:27,508 --> 00:26:31,262
- How was my screen test?
- Wonderful, or you wouldn't be here.

296
00:26:31,345 --> 00:26:32,889
I still don't know anything.

297
00:26:32,972 --> 00:26:37,477
You said to look motherly
and eat a lot of pasta.

298
00:26:39,854 --> 00:26:41,939
I've gained almost seven pounds.
Is that all?

299
00:26:42,023 --> 00:26:44,025
See? You already know more than me.

300
00:26:45,193 --> 00:26:48,112
You're the author.
You might tell me a little more.

301
00:26:48,863 --> 00:26:51,491
- What role does this woman play?
- You mean you don't...

302
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,409
Agostini!

303
00:26:53,493 --> 00:26:54,952
Excuse me.

304
00:26:55,036 --> 00:26:56,829
I don't mean to bother you.

305
00:26:56,913 --> 00:26:59,916
The hotel is grand,
and the whiskey is excellent,

306
00:26:59,999 --> 00:27:01,584
but I have three questions.

307
00:27:01,667 --> 00:27:03,795
We'll discuss them later. What is it?

308
00:27:03,878 --> 00:27:05,838
Ah, yes. Pardon me.

309
00:27:05,922 --> 00:27:07,215
Agostini, we have to...

310
00:27:07,298 --> 00:27:09,842
I just didn't feel like
talking to that guy. What is it?

311
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,304
Claudia has offers
from all over the world.

312
00:27:13,387 --> 00:27:16,265
I can't keep her waiting.
Tell her something.

313
00:27:16,349 --> 00:27:19,310
Do you have a script,
a few pages, an idea?

314
00:27:19,393 --> 00:27:23,981
Does she realize that this might be
the best role she's ever played?

315
00:27:24,065 --> 00:27:25,691
I'll explain.

316
00:27:34,408 --> 00:27:37,119
- You're going to lose her.
- Do you want to see the old men?

317
00:27:37,203 --> 00:27:38,871
Are you crazy? We're ready to go.

318
00:27:38,955 --> 00:27:40,748
- What do you want?
- The old men.

319
00:27:40,832 --> 00:27:42,708
- Where are they?
- Here.

320
00:27:42,792 --> 00:27:45,586
Signora Carla called.
She doesn't want to stay in that hotel.

321
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:48,005
She says it's awful, and she's right.

322
00:27:49,173 --> 00:27:50,925
I'll call the old men.

323
00:27:51,008 --> 00:27:53,928
I'd like to introduce the little woman.

324
00:27:54,011 --> 00:27:55,721
Delighted.

325
00:27:55,805 --> 00:27:57,515
A great pleasure.

326
00:27:57,598 --> 00:27:59,350
She writes too.

327
00:27:59,433 --> 00:28:01,519
She works for some ladies' magazines.

328
00:28:01,602 --> 00:28:04,730
She has a few questions for you too.

329
00:28:04,814 --> 00:28:08,276
My readers go crazy for love stories.

330
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:12,154
Could you tell me something
about your love life?

331
00:28:12,238 --> 00:28:14,991
Here they are. Say hello to the <i>dottore</i>.

332
00:28:15,491 --> 00:28:17,451
Come forward.

333
00:28:17,535 --> 00:28:20,162
You too, General.
Say hello to the <i>dottore</i>.

334
00:28:21,122 --> 00:28:22,748
- How old are you?
- Seventy.

335
00:28:22,832 --> 00:28:24,292
- And you?
- Sixty-four.

336
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:28,254
- And you?
- Sixty-eight.

337
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:33,676
They aren't old enough.

338
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:35,219
What? This one's about to drop dead.

339
00:28:35,303 --> 00:28:37,430
Next time, I'll get three corpses.

340
00:28:37,513 --> 00:28:41,017
You asked for a heartrending type.
One look at him and you wanna cry.

341
00:28:47,148 --> 00:28:48,524
<i>Hello, Commendatore</i>.

342
00:28:51,819 --> 00:28:55,197
If you kneel for me,
what would I have to do for you?

343
00:28:55,281 --> 00:28:57,283
Get up or you'll hurt yourself.

344
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,118
How are you, my little Guido?

345
00:28:59,201 --> 00:29:00,328
<i>Hello, Commendatore</i>.

346
00:29:00,411 --> 00:29:02,830
We took a helicopter.
This one screamed the whole way.

347
00:29:02,914 --> 00:29:06,751
- Where's the swimming pool?
- We just got here. Be quiet.

348
00:29:06,834 --> 00:29:09,086
- Has the treatment helped?
- Yes. What's this?

349
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:11,714
- Just a token.
- You're always giving me presents.

350
00:29:11,797 --> 00:29:13,215
It never needs winding.

351
00:29:13,299 --> 00:29:18,304
Ladies and gentlemen,
observe the little wristwatch.

352
00:29:18,387 --> 00:29:22,767
- So are your ideas any clearer now?
- Yes, I really think so.

353
00:29:23,517 --> 00:29:25,686
We've got the Americans
in the palm of our hand.

354
00:29:53,089 --> 00:29:56,634
I've seen her passport.
She's <i>52</i> years old.

355
00:29:56,717 --> 00:29:58,177
Just a young thing.

356
00:29:58,594 --> 00:30:00,388
Good evening, signora.

357
00:30:00,471 --> 00:30:03,099
And who are you, darling?

358
00:31:09,123 --> 00:31:13,127
Mr. Director,
may I ask another little question?

359
00:31:18,674 --> 00:31:21,886
He wants to know the relationship
between Catholicism and Marxism.

360
00:31:21,969 --> 00:31:23,679
Thank you. I got that.

361
00:31:23,763 --> 00:31:25,806
You want to know
which political party I belong to.

362
00:31:26,223 --> 00:31:30,728
As an honest man —
Which all of you Italians are...

363
00:31:30,811 --> 00:31:33,689
You should be able to answer this.

364
00:31:33,773 --> 00:31:38,194
Is Italy an essentially Catholic country?

365
00:31:38,652 --> 00:31:41,238
Be quiet and eat your ice cream.

366
00:31:42,114 --> 00:31:44,366
It's the estimate for the spaceship.

367
00:31:45,201 --> 00:31:48,954
I'd like to speak to you privately later.

368
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:53,209
I'm at the end of my rope.
This is a madhouse!

369
00:31:53,292 --> 00:31:56,670
Fine. We'll talk later.
What was that about cholesterol?

370
00:32:18,192 --> 00:32:21,695
- Where are our great writers?
- The early Fitzgerald.

371
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:25,783
Then his writing became
an orgy of pragmatism and brutal realism.

372
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:29,662
I mean, what does Left or Right mean?

373
00:32:29,745 --> 00:32:33,749
Are you optimistic enough to believe
that in this confused and chaotic world,

374
00:32:33,833 --> 00:32:36,460
some people's ideas are clear enough

375
00:32:36,544 --> 00:32:39,338
that they belong exclusively
to the Left or the Right?

376
00:32:39,421 --> 00:32:43,425
The Americans have this new theory
about lowering cholesterol...

377
00:32:43,509 --> 00:32:46,512
- ls your asparagus good?
- Very good.

378
00:32:50,015 --> 00:32:52,935
Approximately how many scenes
will there be?

379
00:32:53,018 --> 00:32:54,562
What?

380
00:32:54,645 --> 00:32:56,730
- How many scenes?
- Five.

381
00:32:58,899 --> 00:33:00,151
<i>Just five'?</i>

382
00:33:00,234 --> 00:33:03,154
Perhaps six or even seven.

383
00:33:03,237 --> 00:33:04,697
<i>Good evening, Commendatore</i>.

384
00:33:05,281 --> 00:33:06,490
Hi, Guido.

385
00:33:07,658 --> 00:33:09,827
The ambassador's
giving the signora the eye.

386
00:33:15,374 --> 00:33:16,375
So?

387
00:33:16,458 --> 00:33:18,836
- I thought you'd like to know.
- Fine. Now I know.

388
00:33:18,919 --> 00:33:21,463
- Shall I ask her to dance?
- Yes, do.

389
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:29,597
But I'm so anxious to know,
to understand my character.

390
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:32,349
I need a long time
to live with my character.

391
00:33:32,975 --> 00:33:36,604
The lady says she needs
to get to know her character.

392
00:33:39,315 --> 00:33:43,861
I need to get inside her skin, her ideas,
or I just can't do it.

393
00:33:43,944 --> 00:33:46,655
Hasn't our maestro explained the part yet?

394
00:33:47,531 --> 00:33:49,116
I'm sorry, dear lady.

395
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,953
I don't have such information.
I'm only the producer.

396
00:33:53,287 --> 00:33:56,582
- Guido, isn't that right?
- You mustn't know a thing.

397
00:34:05,216 --> 00:34:07,384
And now three days of rest.

398
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:11,931
They look like glass.

399
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:15,392
The first cherries of spring.

400
00:34:19,438 --> 00:34:21,106
Thanks. And for Guido?

401
00:34:28,489 --> 00:34:31,075
Mario Mezzabotta, all 200 pounds of him.

402
00:34:31,951 --> 00:34:33,953
Shall we take a little walk?

403
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:39,792
I know.

404
00:34:40,417 --> 00:34:44,255
Naturally, you think
I've gone soft in the head.

405
00:34:44,338 --> 00:34:45,339
Yes.

406
00:34:45,422 --> 00:34:47,925
- I'm 30 years her senior. So what?
- That's fine.

407
00:34:48,008 --> 00:34:52,388
I may be the fool, the old imbecile,
the one who foots the bill. So what?

408
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:56,850
Could you create

409
00:34:56,934 --> 00:35:00,145
something real, important
and beautiful on demand?

410
00:35:00,229 --> 00:35:02,648
For instance, if the pope asked you?

411
00:35:03,274 --> 00:35:05,693
Yes, I'll think about it. Excuse me.

412
00:35:07,778 --> 00:35:11,782
Listen, I'm not deluding myself.

413
00:35:11,865 --> 00:35:13,993
Maybe she's just with me for the money.

414
00:35:14,576 --> 00:35:15,953
In fact, I'm sure of it.

415
00:35:16,036 --> 00:35:19,039
But I've never felt closer to anybody
in my life.

416
00:35:20,124 --> 00:35:24,295
Just look at her.
She's pretty, charming, intelligent.

417
00:35:24,378 --> 00:35:27,006
She has it all. Just for the money?

418
00:35:27,089 --> 00:35:29,717
There are loads of rich young men around.

419
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,343
She clearly cares for you.

420
00:35:31,885 --> 00:35:33,220
It's true.

421
00:35:34,054 --> 00:35:36,432
And she hasn't tried to pressure me.

422
00:35:36,515 --> 00:35:38,726
I made up my mind irrationally.

423
00:35:39,184 --> 00:35:43,397
The poor thing has never even mentioned
my wife, my family.

424
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,815
Never a single reproach.

425
00:35:44,898 --> 00:35:46,483
How did you meet her?

426
00:35:47,985 --> 00:35:51,572
In London.
She was in school with my daughter.

427
00:35:52,281 --> 00:35:53,782
How long have you been married?

428
00:35:53,866 --> 00:35:57,369
- Forever. Thirty-one years.
- What does your wife...

429
00:35:58,162 --> 00:36:01,165
My wife took it very badly. She hates her.

430
00:36:01,874 --> 00:36:05,169
Meanwhile, Gloria is fond of her.

431
00:36:07,212 --> 00:36:09,590
Go ahead and say it. I'm an ass.

432
00:36:10,132 --> 00:36:12,509
There must be dates, a shooting schedule.

433
00:36:12,593 --> 00:36:16,305
Otherwise she'll lose a film in Germany.
We have other offers.

434
00:36:16,388 --> 00:36:19,600
Will you leave me in the dark
until the end?

435
00:36:24,021 --> 00:36:26,899
- You look like a <i>lumachina.</i>
- What's that?

436
00:36:26,982 --> 00:36:29,360
<i>Une petite escargot.</i>

437
00:36:34,406 --> 00:36:37,076
Listen to the voice of the springs.

438
00:36:39,787 --> 00:36:42,539
The Romans called them "happy waters."

439
00:36:55,928 --> 00:36:59,723
Maya, let's entertain these bores a bit!

440
00:37:00,224 --> 00:37:02,142
May I, madam?

441
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:08,023
Ready, Maya? What am I holding?

442
00:37:08,732 --> 00:37:11,151
A velvet evening bag.

443
00:37:11,235 --> 00:37:14,071
- And inside?
- A white handkerchief.

444
00:37:14,488 --> 00:37:16,657
A red one.

445
00:37:17,282 --> 00:37:20,452
- No drugs, I hope.
- No, it's aspirin.

446
00:37:21,453 --> 00:37:24,164
- A change purse.
- Ls there any money in it?

447
00:37:24,248 --> 00:37:27,418
<i>2,725</i> lire.

448
00:37:30,379 --> 00:37:32,965
And this lady here, what is she thinking?

449
00:37:33,048 --> 00:37:34,800
Nothing dirty, I hope.

450
00:37:34,883 --> 00:37:37,344
- Think about something.
- Like what?

451
00:37:37,428 --> 00:37:39,596
Whatever you like. What are you thinking?

452
00:37:41,306 --> 00:37:45,185
"I'd like to live another 100 years."

453
00:37:46,186 --> 00:37:48,730
- Was that right?
- Yes!

454
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:53,360
And what does this lovely lady
have in her head?

455
00:37:53,444 --> 00:37:55,070
Leave me alone.

456
00:37:55,154 --> 00:37:57,614
- May I think about a person?
- Yes!

457
00:37:58,157 --> 00:37:59,324
Go ahead.

458
00:37:59,408 --> 00:38:00,576
In that case —.

459
00:38:01,076 --> 00:38:04,538
- No, forget it. I'm too embarrassed.
- What for?

460
00:38:04,621 --> 00:38:06,123
May I really think of a person?

461
00:38:06,206 --> 00:38:08,750
I'd be afraid of having my thoughts read.

462
00:38:08,834 --> 00:38:11,128
Don't worry, darling. No risk there.

463
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:15,215
- A little kiss and a big slap.
- Is that right?

464
00:38:18,635 --> 00:38:22,181
Ladies and gentlemen,
you're thinking, "What a trickster."

465
00:38:22,264 --> 00:38:24,975
Sorry to disappoint you,
but there's no trick,

466
00:38:25,058 --> 00:38:26,727
and it's not just coincidence.

467
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:30,522
It's an exceptional experiment
in magnetic force and telepathy.

468
00:38:30,606 --> 00:38:34,276
I transmit your thoughts
to Mademoiselle Maya.

469
00:38:34,359 --> 00:38:37,488
Do you think you can hide your thoughts?

470
00:38:46,538 --> 00:38:50,334
Please, leave her alone. Don't insist.

471
00:38:50,417 --> 00:38:52,419
Thoughts are sacred.

472
00:38:52,503 --> 00:38:54,505
It's just a game.

473
00:38:54,588 --> 00:38:56,256
Maya, are you ready?

474
00:38:56,924 --> 00:38:59,259
Just a moment, gentlemen.

475
00:38:59,343 --> 00:39:01,970
May we know what you're thinking?

476
00:39:02,054 --> 00:39:05,140
- You, for instance.
- What else? My director.

477
00:39:05,224 --> 00:39:07,226
"My cross and my delight."

478
00:39:07,768 --> 00:39:10,187
- How are you?
- Fine. And you?

479
00:39:10,979 --> 00:39:14,691
- It's been years, hasn't it?
- Yes, sadly, my friend.

480
00:39:15,025 --> 00:39:16,401
I'll be right back.

481
00:39:16,485 --> 00:39:18,904
- You're famous now.
- Cut it out.

482
00:39:18,987 --> 00:39:22,991
But tell me, what's the trick?
How do you transmit —.

483
00:39:23,075 --> 00:39:27,120
It's partly a trick, partly real.
I don't know how, but it happens.

484
00:39:27,204 --> 00:39:28,539
Can you transmit anything?

485
00:39:28,622 --> 00:39:31,333
Anything. Except to tell her to get lost.

486
00:39:31,959 --> 00:39:34,253
- You want to try?
- Yes. Wait.

487
00:39:34,336 --> 00:39:36,505
Watch. With you, I'll mess up.

488
00:39:41,301 --> 00:39:42,970
I don't understand.

489
00:39:44,513 --> 00:39:46,390
I can't repeat it.

490
00:40:12,249 --> 00:40:13,584
Is that right?

491
00:40:17,588 --> 00:40:19,423
Is that it?

492
00:40:20,799 --> 00:40:22,301
But what does it mean?

493
00:40:28,682 --> 00:40:30,684
Guido, come here! Where are you?

494
00:40:31,643 --> 00:40:33,103
Don't be difficult.

495
00:40:33,186 --> 00:40:34,771
I don't want a bath!

496
00:40:34,855 --> 00:40:35,975
Come here. Let me catch you.

497
00:40:36,023 --> 00:40:38,025
I know what this rascal wants.

498
00:40:38,108 --> 00:40:41,194
He wants his sweetheart to carry him,
doesn't he?

499
00:40:41,278 --> 00:40:44,114
Come here.

500
00:40:44,656 --> 00:40:46,676
He never wants to take the wine bath,
the naughty boy.

501
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:49,202
Don't you know it makes you strong
like a man?

502
00:40:49,286 --> 00:40:52,748
Guido's afraid! Guido's afraid!

503
00:41:14,436 --> 00:41:18,065
Hell and tarnation!
The Wood's all wet this year.

504
00:41:18,148 --> 00:41:20,067
That cat is just like your grandfather.

505
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:23,153
Always out on the prowl
and only comes home to eat.

506
00:41:23,904 --> 00:41:25,947
Shame on you! Go to bed!

507
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:30,118
Last time, I slammed the door
in his face

508
00:41:30,994 --> 00:41:32,996
and left him outside for two days.

509
00:41:33,789 --> 00:41:36,583
I could have married again
and found a handsome man

510
00:41:36,667 --> 00:41:41,713
far better than your grandfather,
children.

511
00:41:42,339 --> 00:41:44,341
What an idiot I am.

512
00:41:45,342 --> 00:41:49,346
I thought that if I married again,
my first husband,

513
00:41:49,429 --> 00:41:53,392
whether in heaven or hell,
wouldn't wait for me.

514
00:41:54,017 --> 00:41:57,688
Quiet! Go to bed, children!

515
00:41:57,771 --> 00:41:59,940
To bed!

516
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:08,240
Did you really drink the wine?

517
00:42:26,675 --> 00:42:28,510
Nanny, Claudio wet the bed!

518
00:42:28,593 --> 00:42:31,930
What are you doing?
Go to sleep, all of you.

519
00:42:38,395 --> 00:42:40,522
Little Guido, get under the covers.
It's cold.

520
00:42:40,605 --> 00:42:41,982
Lie Still!

521
00:42:47,279 --> 00:42:49,281
Did you say your prayers?

522
00:42:51,408 --> 00:42:53,577
My beautiful little sticky bun.

523
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:56,455
Give me a kiss too.
Who do you love best?

524
00:42:56,538 --> 00:42:58,123
Me, right?

525
00:43:00,083 --> 00:43:02,544
I'll spank you all! Go to sleep now!

526
00:43:04,379 --> 00:43:06,298
You can't fool me.

527
00:43:07,758 --> 00:43:09,968
I know when you're pretending.

528
00:43:12,846 --> 00:43:15,098
Sleep tight, little ones.

529
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:17,225
Close your eyes!

530
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:36,912
Guido, tonight's the night
the eyes in the painting will move.

531
00:43:36,995 --> 00:43:39,247
You're not scared, are you?
You have to be quiet.

532
00:43:39,331 --> 00:43:42,459
Uncle Agostino will look in a corner,
and the treasure will be there.

533
00:43:42,542 --> 00:43:45,337
Don't be scared. We'll be rich.
Remember the spell?

534
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:48,423
<i>Asa nisi masa. Asa nisi masa.</i>

535
00:44:25,627 --> 00:44:28,505
Sir, you had two or three calls from Rome.

536
00:44:28,588 --> 00:44:30,090
Your wife, I believe.

537
00:44:30,173 --> 00:44:33,343
Really? Fine. Get me the line.

538
00:44:33,426 --> 00:44:36,012
Gino, get the gentleman the line.

539
00:44:36,096 --> 00:44:37,973
This is for you.

540
00:44:38,056 --> 00:44:39,933
Good night, sir.

541
00:44:41,226 --> 00:44:43,854
Marcella, that call from Rome, quickly.

542
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:52,279
Good night, sir.

543
00:44:54,322 --> 00:44:57,325
No, I'm not offended.

544
00:44:57,951 --> 00:45:00,161
There's only one thing that offends me.

545
00:45:01,037 --> 00:45:03,039
Oh, you know me well.

546
00:45:08,795 --> 00:45:11,006
I forgive him for everything.

547
00:45:13,842 --> 00:45:15,552
Everything-

548
00:45:21,683 --> 00:45:23,560
Can we have a little chat?

549
00:45:23,643 --> 00:45:25,312
Come sit beside me.

550
00:45:25,395 --> 00:45:29,399
Sorry, but I'm going to bed.
I'm very tired, and I'm expecting a call.

551
00:45:30,650 --> 00:45:33,194
- Like some?
- No, thanks. I have a bad headache.

552
00:45:34,279 --> 00:45:35,906
Give me your hands.

553
00:45:36,698 --> 00:45:38,283
No. Sit down.

554
00:45:40,076 --> 00:45:43,204
I have a healing fluid in my left hand.

555
00:45:43,288 --> 00:45:46,041
I put it on my tummy when it aches.

556
00:45:46,124 --> 00:45:47,667
Take off your hat.

557
00:45:52,505 --> 00:45:53,840
Better?

558
00:45:58,553 --> 00:45:59,846
Yes, perhaps.

559
00:46:04,726 --> 00:46:07,062
Why do you look at me that way?

560
00:46:07,145 --> 00:46:09,105
And don't call me <i>bellissima</i>.

561
00:46:09,189 --> 00:46:11,816
You make it sound like an insult.

562
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:13,526
What's wrong with you?

563
00:46:15,028 --> 00:46:16,404
I don't know.

564
00:46:18,239 --> 00:46:22,243
I feel like I've made a mess
of everything in my life...

565
00:46:23,536 --> 00:46:25,205
and my work.

566
00:46:29,417 --> 00:46:31,878
Tell me, why do you enjoy torturing me?

567
00:46:32,295 --> 00:46:33,964
Torturing you? Come now.

568
00:46:35,048 --> 00:46:37,801
Talk to me as you would an old friend.

569
00:46:37,884 --> 00:46:41,346
I need to feel close to my director.

570
00:46:46,977 --> 00:46:49,729
Did you see the movie I shot in Belgrade?

571
00:46:49,813 --> 00:46:51,940
I played a woman marked
by the injustices of time,

572
00:46:52,023 --> 00:46:53,817
yet still desirable.

573
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:56,987
A hysterical personality —
Purely fictional, of course.

574
00:46:57,487 --> 00:47:00,865
- Play "Mystification."
- I don't know it.

575
00:47:01,366 --> 00:47:04,869
In this woman I played,

576
00:47:04,953 --> 00:47:08,957
people find protection and love.

577
00:47:11,251 --> 00:47:15,797
I am this character.
I am like her in life and love.

578
00:47:16,172 --> 00:47:18,633
That's why I'm so alone.

579
00:47:19,175 --> 00:47:24,597
I've always forgiven everything
in the man — the men I love.

580
00:47:24,681 --> 00:47:26,933
Sir, Rome's on the line.

581
00:47:27,017 --> 00:47:29,894
I'm very sensual, and wicked too.

582
00:47:29,978 --> 00:47:32,188
You're getting very close.
I'll be right back.

583
00:47:38,153 --> 00:47:39,529
<i>Rome on the line. Go ahead.</i>

584
00:47:39,612 --> 00:47:40,822
Hello?

585
00:47:41,489 --> 00:47:42,949
<i>Do you want Luisa?</i>

586
00:47:43,033 --> 00:47:46,369
<i>Feeling guilty, you monster?
This is Rossella.</i>

587
00:47:46,453 --> 00:47:49,205
Rossella, how are you?
Luisa was looking for me.

588
00:47:49,289 --> 00:47:51,374
<i>Where were you out so late?</i>

589
00:47:51,458 --> 00:47:54,127
<i>A rest cure! Some excuse. Here's Luisa.</i>

590
00:47:54,210 --> 00:47:55,879
Thanks.

591
00:47:56,296 --> 00:47:58,631
<i>Guido, I called twice. Where were you?</i>

592
00:47:58,715 --> 00:48:00,967
I know. I'm sorry.

593
00:48:01,051 --> 00:48:04,345
I was up in the production office.
How are you?

594
00:48:04,429 --> 00:48:07,307
<i>Not bad. How's the rest cure?</i>

595
00:48:08,224 --> 00:48:09,559
<i>Is it helping?</i>

596
00:48:09,642 --> 00:48:13,480
Maybe. I think so.
I can't really rest much.

597
00:48:13,563 --> 00:48:14,814
Are you having fun?

598
00:48:14,898 --> 00:48:17,776
<i>Oh, the usual,
here with Rossella, Tilde and Enrico.</i>

599
00:48:17,859 --> 00:48:19,069
<i>They were just leaving.</i>

600
00:48:19,152 --> 00:48:21,488
<i>But are you having a good time?
Have you met anybody?</i>

601
00:48:21,571 --> 00:48:25,533
Hardly. It's a terrible bore.
But it's better for my work.

602
00:48:27,368 --> 00:48:31,372
<i>You haven't run into anyone you know?
Are you always by yourself?</i>

603
00:48:31,456 --> 00:48:32,999
Of course.

604
00:48:33,083 --> 00:48:34,709
<i>Really?</i>

605
00:48:35,376 --> 00:48:39,798
Luisa, why don't you come visit?
It's a quick trip.

606
00:48:39,881 --> 00:48:42,592
<i>When do you start shooting, you jerk?</i>

607
00:48:42,675 --> 00:48:44,886
I don't know.
Put Luisa back on, please.

608
00:48:44,969 --> 00:48:47,263
<i>So you want me to come?</i>

609
00:48:47,347 --> 00:48:51,101
If you'd like. Maybe even bring a friend.

610
00:48:51,184 --> 00:48:54,938
<i>- But would it make you happy?
- Of course, or</i> I <i>wouldn't ask.</i>

611
00:48:55,021 --> 00:48:57,023
- <i>More time, sir?
- No, thanks.</i>

612
00:48:57,107 --> 00:49:00,151
- <i>When</i> should / come?
- Whenever you'd like.

613
00:49:00,235 --> 00:49:03,696
- <i>Watch out, or I might really do it.
- Darling,</i> I <i>wouldn't have asked.</i>

614
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:06,366
I'd love it. Good night now.

615
00:49:06,449 --> 00:49:08,535
<i>So long, you madman!</i>

616
00:49:09,494 --> 00:49:11,121
<i>Night, Guido.</i>

617
00:49:18,795 --> 00:49:21,464
Monsieur Guido, my agent thought —.

618
00:49:21,548 --> 00:49:24,217
Just a second, madam.
I have to see Agostino.

619
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:26,219
- Shit!
- It's important.

620
00:49:26,302 --> 00:49:29,055
We'll discuss everything
tomorrow morning, all right?

621
00:49:35,395 --> 00:49:39,232
Beams for the central structure, 10,000.

622
00:49:39,315 --> 00:49:42,318
Planks for steps, 260.

623
00:49:42,402 --> 00:49:44,154
- Evening.
- Do you need something?

624
00:49:44,237 --> 00:49:46,197
No, thanks. Go on with your work.

625
00:49:47,198 --> 00:49:50,076
What a production!

626
00:49:53,454 --> 00:49:55,498
Hi, Eleonora.

627
00:49:58,543 --> 00:50:01,087
Listen, <i>Dottore</i>, since you're here,

628
00:50:01,171 --> 00:50:04,507
I called the pensione about
the German girl, but she's gone.

629
00:50:04,591 --> 00:50:06,801
- You must find her.
- She's in Paris with a circus.

630
00:50:06,885 --> 00:50:08,052
Really?

631
00:50:12,891 --> 00:50:14,934
What should I do?

632
00:50:16,477 --> 00:50:20,398
What an honor, <i>Dottore</i>!
You caught me with my pants down!

633
00:50:20,481 --> 00:50:24,861
Listen, Guido. About that farm —.

634
00:50:24,944 --> 00:50:27,864
Ah, here it is. Where's this place?

635
00:50:28,865 --> 00:50:31,117
There's no address or anything.

636
00:50:31,201 --> 00:50:33,077
It's on the prince's estate.

637
00:50:33,161 --> 00:50:36,164
- Who's in there?
- My little nieces.

638
00:50:36,247 --> 00:50:38,041
Eva and Dina.

639
00:50:38,124 --> 00:50:39,876
Evening.

640
00:50:40,877 --> 00:50:42,921
Come out here, silly.

641
00:50:43,004 --> 00:50:45,798
He might give you a little part.

642
00:50:46,883 --> 00:50:49,427
- It's a pleasure.
- The pleasure's mine.

643
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:52,305
- Where are you from?
- Trieste.

644
00:50:52,388 --> 00:50:53,765
Hooray for Italy!

645
00:50:56,851 --> 00:50:59,812
- You've settled in, eh?
- Tell him about my cousin.

646
00:50:59,896 --> 00:51:02,941
Guido, she has a female cousin
six feet tall.

647
00:51:03,358 --> 00:51:05,777
She might be good for the movie.

648
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:07,612
This little minx here —.

649
00:51:07,695 --> 00:51:11,574
It's true. She's as tall as me
when I stand on the bed.

650
00:51:11,658 --> 00:51:13,910
- See?
- She's been Miss Nylon Stockings twice.

651
00:51:13,993 --> 00:51:16,496
Is Guido in there? I'm coming in.

652
00:51:16,579 --> 00:51:18,206
Conocchia, I'll see you tomorrow.

653
00:51:18,706 --> 00:51:21,918
- May I ask a question?
- Go ahead.

654
00:51:22,001 --> 00:51:24,212
My friend here says...

655
00:51:24,796 --> 00:51:28,341
you don't know how to make a love story.

656
00:51:28,424 --> 00:51:29,801
She's right.

657
00:51:30,677 --> 00:51:33,346
- Shall I wake you in the morning?
- No, thanks.

658
00:51:33,429 --> 00:51:35,473
Pipe down, girls.

659
00:51:37,183 --> 00:51:39,435
Our commander
will never catch us unprepared!

660
00:51:39,519 --> 00:51:41,312
This production crew never sleeps!

661
00:51:41,396 --> 00:51:44,274
I've got a splitting headache. Stop that.

662
00:51:44,941 --> 00:51:47,527
They're always horsing around,
but they're good guys.

663
00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:51,948
You need anything, Guido?
Any new ideas to tell me about?

664
00:51:52,031 --> 00:51:55,618
No, Conocchia, I don't need anything.
Go back to bed.

665
00:51:55,702 --> 00:51:57,745
- Anything at all.
- No, thanks. Good night.

666
00:51:58,413 --> 00:52:01,082
Good night, my ass!

667
00:52:01,165 --> 00:52:05,169
Who can get to sleep around here?

668
00:52:05,253 --> 00:52:07,255
Conocchia, don't make a fuss.

669
00:52:07,338 --> 00:52:10,174
Excuse me, but I've worked
in this business for 30 years

670
00:52:10,258 --> 00:52:13,094
on movies none of you could even imagine,

671
00:52:13,177 --> 00:52:14,971
and I've never been afraid of anything!

672
00:52:15,054 --> 00:52:17,056
Why are you shouting, you crazy old man?

673
00:52:17,807 --> 00:52:20,685
Now you've said it. "Old man."

674
00:52:20,768 --> 00:52:24,439
It finally came out.
Conocchia's an old man.

675
00:52:24,522 --> 00:52:27,066
What do you want? Get back inside.

676
00:52:27,942 --> 00:52:30,361
You always keep me in the dark.

677
00:52:30,445 --> 00:52:34,157
I never know what to do,
when to talk or when to shut up.

678
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:37,493
I'm not trying to pester you.
I don't want to know what it's about.

679
00:52:37,577 --> 00:52:41,414
- Want to keep it a secret? Go ahead.
- Please go back to bed.

680
00:52:42,832 --> 00:52:46,419
If I'm to help you,
like you've always appreciated,

681
00:52:46,502 --> 00:52:48,171
you have to tell me something.

682
00:52:48,254 --> 00:52:50,214
"Get rid of the French woman,"

683
00:52:50,298 --> 00:52:53,676
or "This is how I want the spaceship"
or "Go hang yourself!"

684
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,428
But tell me something!

685
00:52:56,596 --> 00:52:58,681
You've changed, my friend.

686
00:53:00,767 --> 00:53:03,311
Now you're crying too?

687
00:53:03,394 --> 00:53:04,979
Aren't you ashamed?

688
00:53:05,063 --> 00:53:07,565
I'm quitting tomorrow.

689
00:53:07,648 --> 00:53:11,027
I don't want to be in your way.
You need some young blood.

690
00:53:11,444 --> 00:53:13,279
But be careful.

691
00:53:13,363 --> 00:53:15,365
You're not the man you used to be either.

692
00:53:40,014 --> 00:53:42,016
A crisis of inspiration?

693
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:45,603
What if it's not temporary,
my dear friend?

694
00:53:46,396 --> 00:53:51,192
What if it's the final downfall
of a big, fat, no-talent impostor?

695
00:53:51,275 --> 00:53:52,318
Sgulp!

696
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:21,472
Let's suppose you're the symbol of purity

697
00:54:22,306 --> 00:54:24,142
and spontaneity.

698
00:54:25,184 --> 00:54:28,020
But what the hell does it mean
to be truly honest?

699
00:54:28,104 --> 00:54:29,856
Didn't you hear what that big hawk said?

700
00:54:29,939 --> 00:54:31,941
"It's time to set all the symbols aside...

701
00:54:32,024 --> 00:54:34,944
The lure of purity, innocence, escape."

702
00:54:37,572 --> 00:54:39,031
What is it you want?

703
00:54:53,671 --> 00:54:56,382
Yes, this could work.

704
00:54:56,466 --> 00:55:01,095
There's a museum in town,
and you're the custodian's daughter,

705
00:55:01,471 --> 00:55:04,974
who grew up among images
of ancient beauty.

706
00:55:20,698 --> 00:55:22,742
You're right.

707
00:55:57,485 --> 00:55:59,987
I've come to stay and never leave.

708
00:56:01,906 --> 00:56:03,616
I want to bring order.

709
00:56:04,617 --> 00:56:06,702
I want to clean.

710
00:56:07,703 --> 00:56:11,290
I want to bring order. I want to —.

711
00:56:23,302 --> 00:56:25,429
<i>A call for you from the Railway Hotel.</i>

712
00:56:25,513 --> 00:56:27,139
Put it through.

713
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:29,016
Hello?

714
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:31,102
Who's there?

715
00:56:31,686 --> 00:56:33,020
Hello!

716
00:56:33,104 --> 00:56:36,023
<i>Guido, I feel awful.
The mineral water made me sick.</i>

717
00:56:36,107 --> 00:56:39,235
<i>I have a fever. Come over right away.</i>

718
00:56:39,318 --> 00:56:41,737
At this time of night? I can't.

719
00:56:41,821 --> 00:56:43,406
- I'll come tomorrow.
<i>- Come.</i>

720
00:56:43,823 --> 00:56:47,368
The poor thing was calling for you.
Here's the ice.

721
00:56:50,371 --> 00:56:53,416
She's burning up.
Her temperature's at least 104.

722
00:56:54,625 --> 00:56:57,712
- Should I bring the peas?
- What peas?

723
00:56:57,795 --> 00:57:01,257
In her delirium, she asked for peas.
A good sign.

724
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:02,925
No, forget about the peas.

725
00:57:03,009 --> 00:57:05,011
If you need anything, let us know.

726
00:57:10,725 --> 00:57:12,310
Carla.

727
00:57:14,562 --> 00:57:17,732
Have you run a sudden high fever
like this before?

728
00:57:21,444 --> 00:57:25,698
Yes. The slightest thing
and it shoots up to 104.

729
00:57:25,781 --> 00:57:28,951
Then it passes. My husband's used to it.

730
00:57:29,035 --> 00:57:30,786
It doesn't scare him.

731
00:57:32,038 --> 00:57:34,540
No, don't get up. Stay under the covers.

732
00:57:34,624 --> 00:57:36,709
I'm so hot. I'm thirsty.

733
00:57:36,792 --> 00:57:38,878
Wait. I'll get it for you. Here.

734
00:57:41,964 --> 00:57:44,425
Drink slowly, or you'll get bloated.

735
00:57:46,510 --> 00:57:48,054
Is it day or night?

736
00:57:48,137 --> 00:57:51,140
Night? It's 4:00 in the afternoon.

737
00:57:51,223 --> 00:57:54,060
We'll wait and see
what the doctor has to say.

738
00:57:54,143 --> 00:57:56,979
It wouldn't be a bad idea
to send your husband a telegram.

739
00:57:57,063 --> 00:58:01,359
We can't take responsibility.
Yes, he ought to know.

740
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:06,030
No, I don't want it to be over.
He'll take me away.

741
00:58:06,113 --> 00:58:08,699
I bought so many pretty little dresses.

742
00:58:08,783 --> 00:58:10,576
Why did you drink all that water?

743
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:12,662
That's for sick people. Are you sick?

744
00:58:12,745 --> 00:58:15,831
Whenever there's something to gorge on,
you always —.

745
00:58:16,582 --> 00:58:19,669
What am I supposed to do?
You leave me alone all the time.

746
00:58:23,756 --> 00:58:27,551
I drew up a will two years ago.

747
00:58:27,635 --> 00:58:30,763
It's not like you die sooner
just because you make a will.

748
00:58:31,430 --> 00:58:35,643
You see, I have a brother and sister...

749
00:58:36,727 --> 00:58:39,689
but I'd like the apartment
to go to my husband.

750
00:58:39,772 --> 00:58:43,818
It's mine, but how would the poor thing
manage without it

751
00:58:43,901 --> 00:58:45,986
even if he does remarry?

752
00:58:46,070 --> 00:58:48,614
Ah, these sheets!

753
00:58:50,991 --> 00:58:54,829
Guido, tell me the truth.

754
00:58:56,247 --> 00:58:57,832
The truth, you hear?

755
00:58:58,457 --> 00:59:00,668
Why are you with me?

756
00:59:02,461 --> 00:59:05,589
<i>What can I say to the cardinal tomorrow?</i>

757
00:59:07,007 --> 00:59:12,012
Yes, I read the brief synopsis
your producer sent us. Very interesting.

758
00:59:12,096 --> 00:59:14,265
However, realistically speaking,

759
00:59:14,348 --> 00:59:18,644
a prince of the church
would never meet your protagonist

760
00:59:18,728 --> 00:59:20,438
during a mud treatment.

761
00:59:20,521 --> 00:59:22,648
I'm sorry, but it's quite impossible.

762
00:59:22,732 --> 00:59:24,900
A high prelate has his own room.

763
00:59:24,984 --> 00:59:27,737
Yes, but I was seeking
an unconventional encounter.

764
00:59:27,820 --> 00:59:28,821
In what sense?

765
00:59:28,904 --> 00:59:31,907
The protagonist
received a Catholic upbringing —.

766
00:59:31,991 --> 00:59:35,202
- Good morning.
- Monsignor, this is Guido Anselmi.

767
00:59:35,286 --> 00:59:37,288
- A pleasure.
- You must be the director.

768
00:59:37,788 --> 00:59:41,041
Is this film of a religious nature?

769
00:59:41,125 --> 00:59:42,293
In a way.

770
00:59:42,376 --> 00:59:45,796
I was explaining that the protagonist
had a Catholic upbringing,

771
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:47,840
like all of us,

772
00:59:47,923 --> 00:59:52,887
so he has certain complexes,
certain needs he can no longer repress.

773
00:59:52,970 --> 00:59:56,056
A prince of the church seems to him
like the guardian of a truth

774
00:59:56,140 --> 00:59:58,421
he can no longer accept,
although it still fascinates him.

775
00:59:58,476 --> 01:00:02,521
So he seeks contact, some help,
perhaps even a revelation.

776
01:00:02,605 --> 01:00:05,775
- Saul in Damascus, right?
- Don't we all harbor such hopes?

777
01:00:05,858 --> 01:00:08,694
I realize it may sound
a bit superficial, even clumsy.

778
01:00:08,778 --> 01:00:10,529
No, that's not it.

779
01:00:10,613 --> 01:00:15,367
I just don't believe cinema
lends itself to certain topics.

780
01:00:15,451 --> 01:00:19,205
You mix sacred and profane love
too casually.

781
01:00:19,288 --> 01:00:21,123
- Don't you think?
- It depends.

782
01:00:21,207 --> 01:00:23,375
Yours is a great responsibility.

783
01:00:23,459 --> 01:00:26,712
You can either educate
or corrupt millions of souls.

784
01:00:26,796 --> 01:00:29,215
In any case,
His Eminence will listen to you.

785
01:00:29,298 --> 01:00:31,509
You may ask him a few questions.

786
01:00:35,763 --> 01:00:38,766
Your Eminence,
allow me to introduce the director.

787
01:00:40,935 --> 01:00:42,853
Please have a seat.

788
01:00:44,230 --> 01:00:47,942
Please pardon the intrusion,
Your Eminence,

789
01:00:48,025 --> 01:00:50,736
but my producer is beset by doubts,

790
01:00:50,820 --> 01:00:52,279
perhaps with good reason,

791
01:00:52,363 --> 01:00:54,365
and he insisted that I —.

792
01:00:54,448 --> 01:00:56,951
- Are you married?
- Yes.

793
01:00:57,743 --> 01:00:59,870
- Any children?
- Yes — I mean, no.

794
01:01:00,746 --> 01:01:02,581
- How old are you?
- Forty-three.

795
01:01:07,419 --> 01:01:10,172
- You hear this singing bird?
- Pardon?

796
01:01:10,256 --> 01:01:12,216
Do you know what it's called?

797
01:01:13,050 --> 01:01:14,802
It's called <i>Diomedeo</i>.

798
01:01:15,511 --> 01:01:19,723
Legend has it that when Diomedes died,

799
01:01:19,807 --> 01:01:23,102
all these little birds gathered

800
01:01:23,185 --> 01:01:27,189
and sang a funeral chorus
as they accompanied him to his grave.

801
01:01:29,316 --> 01:01:31,652
Hear that? It sounds like sobbing.

802
01:02:04,852 --> 01:02:07,938
Guido, let's go see Saraghina!

803
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:17,698
I'm coming.

804
01:02:33,005 --> 01:02:35,007
Saraghina!

805
01:02:51,315 --> 01:02:53,400
Saraghina, dance the rumba.

806
01:02:54,526 --> 01:02:56,028
Come here.

807
01:05:44,947 --> 01:05:47,324
You should be ashamed!

808
01:05:47,699 --> 01:05:50,119
It's a mortal sin. It's a mortal sin.

809
01:05:50,202 --> 01:05:53,455
I don't believe it. It can't be.

810
01:05:55,999 --> 01:05:57,709
Look at your mother!

811
01:05:58,418 --> 01:05:59,586
Stop right there.

812
01:05:59,670 --> 01:06:02,506
Oh, God, the shame!

813
01:06:04,383 --> 01:06:06,885
The shame and anguish!

814
01:06:13,767 --> 01:06:16,019
The shame!

815
01:06:38,250 --> 01:06:40,252
SHAME

816
01:06:43,172 --> 01:06:47,009
"Throughout his whole life,
anywhere he lived,

817
01:06:47,092 --> 01:06:51,555
the pious Luigi abhorred most of all
any contact with women,

818
01:06:52,181 --> 01:06:54,933
whose presence he so avoided

819
01:06:55,017 --> 01:06:59,563
"that everyone thought he had
a natural antipathy toward them."

820
01:06:59,646 --> 01:07:00,647
Get down.

821
01:07:01,231 --> 01:07:02,524
Get down!

822
01:07:02,608 --> 01:07:04,651
"even with his sister, the marquise.

823
01:07:04,735 --> 01:07:08,614
And if it happened
that while he was speaking to her"...

824
01:07:31,595 --> 01:07:34,640
Don't you know
that Saraghina is the devil?

825
01:07:35,140 --> 01:07:37,643
No, I didn't know. I really didn't.

826
01:08:43,166 --> 01:08:44,793
So, what does it mean?

827
01:08:48,672 --> 01:08:51,133
It's a character
based on your childhood memories.

828
01:08:51,717 --> 01:08:54,469
It has no connection
with a true critical conscience.

829
01:08:55,387 --> 01:08:58,307
No, if you really wish
to engage in a polemic

830
01:08:58,390 --> 01:09:02,978
about Catholic consciousness
in Italy, my friend,

831
01:09:03,061 --> 01:09:08,608
you'd need a much higher
degree of culture...

832
01:09:09,484 --> 01:09:12,529
as well as
a rigorously clear-headed logic.

833
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:14,781
Forgive me...

834
01:09:15,615 --> 01:09:19,536
but your naïveté is a serious failing.

835
01:09:20,620 --> 01:09:23,373
Your little nostalgia-bathed memories,

836
01:09:23,457 --> 01:09:27,502
your harmless and essentially
sentimental evocations —.

837
01:09:27,586 --> 01:09:31,048
"What?" said the parish priest.
"With a communist?"

838
01:09:31,131 --> 01:09:32,758
He didn't say "a man," you see?

839
01:09:33,091 --> 01:09:35,802
Catholic consciousness.

840
01:09:38,430 --> 01:09:42,684
Just think what Suetonius was
in the time of the Caesars.

841
01:09:42,768 --> 01:09:46,646
No, you set out to denounce,

842
01:09:47,522 --> 01:09:51,818
but you end up an accomplice.

843
01:09:51,902 --> 01:09:54,988
I'm sure you see
the confusion and ambiguity.

844
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:06,750
My dear doctor,
I'm very angry with you, you know?

845
01:10:06,833 --> 01:10:09,961
- You don't need me anymore.
- That's not true.

846
01:10:10,045 --> 01:10:13,131
127. Showers and mud baths.

847
01:10:13,548 --> 01:10:16,301
129. Massages.

848
01:10:17,094 --> 01:10:20,430
131. Inhalations.

849
01:10:36,822 --> 01:10:38,865
Hello, <i>Commendatore</i>.

850
01:10:40,492 --> 01:10:43,745
I've figured out
what you're trying to get at...

851
01:10:43,829 --> 01:10:47,290
A man's inner confusion.

852
01:10:47,374 --> 01:10:50,127
But you must be clear
and get your point across.

853
01:10:50,210 --> 01:10:52,003
Otherwise, what's the use?

854
01:10:55,924 --> 01:10:57,300
Let's go.

855
01:10:58,385 --> 01:10:59,970
<i>Attention.</i>

856
01:11:00,053 --> 01:11:04,516
<i>Dr. Angelis,
please report to the rest area.</i>

857
01:11:06,726 --> 01:11:10,063
If what you have to say is interesting,
it must be so for everybody.

858
01:11:10,147 --> 01:11:13,775
How can you not care
if audiences understand?

859
01:11:13,859 --> 01:11:17,154
I'm sorry, but that's arrogant
and presumptuous.

860
01:11:17,237 --> 01:11:19,406
<i>Commendatore</i>.

861
01:11:19,948 --> 01:11:22,951
Let's go over there. Breathe deeply.

862
01:11:23,034 --> 01:11:24,286
Hi, Guido.

863
01:11:24,369 --> 01:11:26,371
I've saved you a spot by the steam.

864
01:11:26,455 --> 01:11:31,126
I saw the spaceship this morning.
It's 165 feet tall already.

865
01:11:49,561 --> 01:11:50,770
Mario.

866
01:12:12,709 --> 01:12:15,879
<i>Guido, His Eminence is waiting for you.</i>

867
01:12:17,088 --> 01:12:19,299
<i>We repeat.</i>

868
01:12:19,382 --> 01:12:23,220
<i>His Eminence is waiting.</i>

869
01:12:25,180 --> 01:12:27,641
Get dressed, quickly.

870
01:12:27,724 --> 01:12:29,809
The cardinal is waiting.
Tell him everything.

871
01:12:29,893 --> 01:12:32,103
Confess everything. Don't hide anything.

872
01:12:32,187 --> 01:12:36,399
If you can, put in a good word for me too.

873
01:12:36,483 --> 01:12:39,110
This is a golden opportunity.
The cardinal!

874
01:12:39,194 --> 01:12:42,447
You're so lucky. He can grant anything.

875
01:12:42,531 --> 01:12:46,451
Get me my Mexican divorce.
He won't say no to you.

876
01:12:46,535 --> 01:12:48,537
Above all, be devout.

877
01:12:48,620 --> 01:12:52,582
Fall on your knees, kiss his ring, cry,
say you've repented.

878
01:12:52,666 --> 01:12:58,672
Getting in their good graces means
you can have anything you want in life.

879
01:12:58,755 --> 01:13:02,801
I beg of you, Guido. We're in your hands.

880
01:13:08,306 --> 01:13:10,600
Just five minutes.

881
01:13:25,532 --> 01:13:29,077
Your Eminence, I'm not happy.

882
01:13:31,496 --> 01:13:33,832
Why should you be happy?

883
01:13:33,915 --> 01:13:36,209
That is not your task.

884
01:13:38,295 --> 01:13:41,965
Who told you we come into this world
to be happy?

885
01:13:42,048 --> 01:13:44,884
Origen says in his homilies...

886
01:13:46,052 --> 01:13:49,764
<i>"Extra ecclesiam nulla salus.</i>"

887
01:13:50,890 --> 01:13:54,102
There is no salvation outside the church.

888
01:13:54,185 --> 01:13:58,189
<i>“Extra ecclesiam nemo salavtur.“</i>

889
01:13:59,107 --> 01:14:02,485
No one will find salvation
outside the church.

890
01:14:04,779 --> 01:14:09,159
<i>“Salus extra ecclesiam non est.“</i>

891
01:14:10,535 --> 01:14:14,122
There is no salvation outside the church.

892
01:14:15,498 --> 01:14:17,751
"<i>Civitas dei.</i>"

893
01:14:17,834 --> 01:14:20,754
He who does not belong to the City of God

894
01:14:20,837 --> 01:14:24,674
belongs to the City of the Devil.

895
01:14:48,823 --> 01:14:52,118
Come see this great human phenomenon,
the fakir Shiva,

896
01:14:52,202 --> 01:14:54,704
who's broken all previous records.

897
01:14:54,788 --> 01:15:00,043
Our experiment is monitored daily
by European experts.

898
01:15:23,358 --> 01:15:27,862
20,000... 22,000.. 23,000.
And the lady in the back?

899
01:15:27,946 --> 01:15:30,365
25,000.

900
01:15:30,448 --> 01:15:31,950
The bid is 25,000.

901
01:15:32,033 --> 01:15:33,952
Do I hear 30,000?

902
01:15:34,035 --> 01:15:39,708
35,000... 40,000. Very good.

903
01:15:39,791 --> 01:15:43,420
Any more offers? I have 50,000.

904
01:16:06,317 --> 01:16:08,445
- When did you get here?
- At 5:00.

905
01:16:08,528 --> 01:16:10,739
We went to the hotel,
but you weren't there.

906
01:16:11,281 --> 01:16:12,866
- How are you?
- Fine.

907
01:16:14,617 --> 01:16:18,163
- Who did you come with?
- Rossella, Enrico and Tilde.

908
01:16:18,246 --> 01:16:20,123
- Where's Rossella?
- Over there.

909
01:16:22,959 --> 01:16:24,961
Good girl. You actually came.

910
01:16:25,044 --> 01:16:26,463
You look good, you know?

911
01:16:28,089 --> 01:16:29,257
Hey, Rossa!

912
01:16:29,340 --> 01:16:33,011
The last time we danced together
was a year ago.

913
01:16:35,096 --> 01:16:38,183
Luisa, darling. You're such a sweetheart.

914
01:16:38,266 --> 01:16:40,643
I'm so happy you came.

915
01:16:40,727 --> 01:16:44,564
It's always the same.
Whenever you're far away —.

916
01:16:44,647 --> 01:16:46,232
You feel lonely.

917
01:16:46,316 --> 01:16:48,568
Is that true? Did you miss me?

918
01:16:50,987 --> 01:16:54,157
You didn't have the company
of all these lovely ladies?

919
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:55,909
Ah, so you noticed them.

920
01:16:55,992 --> 01:16:58,328
No flings since you left?

921
01:16:58,411 --> 01:17:01,664
Poor Guido. And your famous virility?

922
01:17:01,748 --> 01:17:03,458
- You smell so nice.
- You like it?

923
01:17:03,541 --> 01:17:05,001
You're so light.

924
01:17:06,836 --> 01:17:09,088
How's your project going? Better?

925
01:17:09,172 --> 01:17:12,926
Well, I don't think I've made
any great progress.

926
01:17:13,009 --> 01:17:16,721
What's it about?
What are you up to this time?

927
01:17:19,265 --> 01:17:20,475
Sorry.

928
01:17:21,351 --> 01:17:24,354
Am I mistaken,
or is Enrico a little in love with you?

929
01:17:30,401 --> 01:17:31,986
Adorable, isn't she?

930
01:17:38,910 --> 01:17:40,537
Wonderful!

931
01:17:40,620 --> 01:17:42,455
Good evening. So nice to have you here.

932
01:17:43,706 --> 01:17:47,377
Maestro, we're at your disposal.
Shall we get going?

933
01:17:47,460 --> 01:17:48,586
I'm coming.

934
01:17:48,670 --> 01:17:50,588
My dear lady, tonight you'll see

935
01:17:50,672 --> 01:17:53,508
the depths of insanity
to which a producer can fall.

936
01:17:54,259 --> 01:17:57,595
Frankly, I'd rather not shake hands
with this lovely lady.

937
01:17:57,679 --> 01:17:59,764
One touch
and she knows what you're thinking.

938
01:18:00,431 --> 01:18:03,685
- I knew it! Who else?
- Your guiding spirit.

939
01:18:04,269 --> 01:18:06,604
Haven't you reached
that stage of intimacy yet?

940
01:18:06,688 --> 01:18:09,482
- May I introduce my sister?
- Ah, the beautiful little sister.

941
01:18:09,566 --> 01:18:12,151
You see the kind of women
your director attracts?

942
01:18:12,235 --> 01:18:13,778
How lucky to meet you, <i>Commendatore</i>.

943
01:18:13,862 --> 01:18:16,823
I just finished a screenplay
about nuclear warfare.

944
01:18:16,906 --> 01:18:19,367
Only a producer of your courage
could get it made.

945
01:18:19,450 --> 01:18:21,953
Is the beautiful sorceress
part of your harem too?

946
01:18:22,036 --> 01:18:25,790
Let's just say
I'm a sort of managing supervisor.

947
01:18:26,708 --> 01:18:30,378
So, are you any better?
Has the solitude helped?

948
01:18:30,962 --> 01:18:32,797
Actually, you do look like a new man.

949
01:18:33,464 --> 01:18:36,259
But really, are you better?
I was a little worried.

950
01:18:36,342 --> 01:18:40,096
It was good of you to invite Luisa.
She was so happy.

951
01:18:40,179 --> 01:18:44,350
I'd rather not go.
You don't really need me.

952
01:18:44,434 --> 01:18:47,979
I insist, my friend.
Get in Conocchia's car.

953
01:18:48,062 --> 01:18:50,106
Sweetie, go ride with the others.

954
01:18:50,189 --> 01:18:52,233
- Guido, where's your wife?
- She was just here.

955
01:18:52,942 --> 01:18:55,486
- Rossella, come with us.
- Sit next to me.

956
01:18:55,570 --> 01:18:58,239
I want to tell you a strange story.

957
01:18:58,323 --> 01:19:00,742
- My sister was a nun who died young.
- Luisa, come on.

958
01:19:00,825 --> 01:19:05,580
One night her portrait
suddenly changes expression...

959
01:19:05,663 --> 01:19:07,665
Rossella, get in...

960
01:19:07,749 --> 01:19:09,918
As if to warn me of some danger.

961
01:19:10,001 --> 01:19:11,628
I'll sit in front.

962
01:19:12,670 --> 01:19:16,883
A few days later, my uncle tells me,
"Come to the market with me, kid."

963
01:19:16,966 --> 01:19:18,760
He drove an Isotta-Fraschini.

964
01:19:18,843 --> 01:19:21,679
I was telling the story of a premonition.

965
01:19:49,832 --> 01:19:53,127
What do you think? You gotta be crazy
to listen to this director.

966
01:19:53,461 --> 01:19:55,213
Bundle up. It's damp.

967
01:19:58,675 --> 01:20:01,260
Renato, where are you?

968
01:20:01,344 --> 01:20:03,513
Here, <i>Commendatore</i>. Good evening.

969
01:20:03,596 --> 01:20:05,515
We've gotta be ready for the 20th.

970
01:20:05,598 --> 01:20:08,977
Follow me. Careful. The ground's uneven.

971
01:20:09,060 --> 01:20:13,272
- It seems we're a bit behind.
- No, we're already up to 230 feet.

972
01:20:13,356 --> 01:20:16,943
What's wrong with Luisa?
She's suddenly so nervous and angry.

973
01:20:17,026 --> 01:20:19,445
I don't know.
She was so happy to come see you.

974
01:20:19,529 --> 01:20:21,572
Maybe you said something that upset her.

975
01:20:21,656 --> 01:20:23,116
What's this?

976
01:20:23,199 --> 01:20:25,535
I find this extraordinarily fascinating.

977
01:20:25,618 --> 01:20:28,371
This model will be superimposed
on the structure

978
01:20:28,454 --> 01:20:31,040
to create the illusion
that the rocket's on the launchpad.

979
01:20:31,124 --> 01:20:34,419
- Am I right?
- Yes, that's right.

980
01:20:34,502 --> 01:20:38,715
And this is the launch ramp,
for the most important scene.

981
01:20:38,798 --> 01:20:40,383
Come on up. It's perfectly safe.

982
01:20:41,342 --> 01:20:44,470
- No pictures.
- Just one, <i>Commendatore</i>.

983
01:20:44,554 --> 01:20:46,389
What's your husband up to?

984
01:20:46,472 --> 01:20:48,057
A science fiction film?

985
01:20:48,141 --> 01:20:50,393
How should I know? Ask him.

986
01:20:50,476 --> 01:20:53,813
Giancarlo wrote him
such a wonderful story about Martians.

987
01:20:55,356 --> 01:20:56,816
What's this amusement park for?

988
01:20:56,899 --> 01:21:01,529
No construction company
wanted to take on this job.

989
01:21:02,447 --> 01:21:04,157
It rests entirely on sand.

990
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:07,076
Cesarino, how many pounds
of concrete did it take?

991
01:21:07,160 --> 01:21:09,871
Pounds? Tons!

992
01:21:09,954 --> 01:21:11,914
400 tons.

993
01:21:11,998 --> 01:21:14,709
If you don't mind,
I'll stop at the first landing.

994
01:21:14,792 --> 01:21:16,335
I have vertigo.

995
01:21:16,419 --> 01:21:19,130
With 80 million,
you could buy a least ten apartments.

996
01:21:19,213 --> 01:21:22,133
It's a pompous shack, just like him.
A self-portrait.

997
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:25,678
The little sister-in-law
isn't exactly tender toward our director.

998
01:21:25,762 --> 01:21:27,430
- Maybe she's in love.
- With him?

999
01:21:27,513 --> 01:21:30,266
I pray day and night
to be spared a husband like him.

1000
01:21:30,349 --> 01:21:33,686
- Still more climbing?
- I'll gladly carry you.

1001
01:21:33,770 --> 01:21:38,357
When I think he spent
80 million on this structure.

1002
01:21:38,441 --> 01:21:41,652
Wouldn't a nice painted backdrop
have been better?

1003
01:21:41,736 --> 01:21:44,697
A backdrop!
That's from your grandfather's day.

1004
01:21:44,781 --> 01:21:46,616
Besides, are they your millions,
Conocchia?

1005
01:21:49,243 --> 01:21:50,328
Luisa.

1006
01:21:51,996 --> 01:21:54,082
Are you cold? Take my jacket.

1007
01:21:54,165 --> 01:21:57,418
No, thank you.
We're going back to the hotel now anyway.

1008
01:22:00,713 --> 01:22:03,925
Is something wrong?
You got sad all of a sudden.

1009
01:22:06,219 --> 01:22:07,887
Didn't you?

1010
01:22:07,970 --> 01:22:11,099
No, I'm not sad at all.

1011
01:22:15,478 --> 01:22:17,897
The sequence opens with an image of Earth

1012
01:22:17,980 --> 01:22:20,900
completely destroyed
by thermonuclear war...

1013
01:22:21,442 --> 01:22:23,820
Guido seemed really happy to see you.

1014
01:22:23,903 --> 01:22:29,158
And the spaceship, our new Noah's Ark,
flees the atomic plague,

1015
01:22:29,242 --> 01:22:32,161
while the rest of humanity
seeks refuge on another planet.

1016
01:22:32,245 --> 01:22:37,458
More than 15,000 extras,
a tragic multitude in search of...

1017
01:22:37,542 --> 01:22:40,670
We're really going to see all that
in your movie?

1018
01:22:40,753 --> 01:22:42,880
<i>Mamma mia!</i> The prophet speaks.

1019
01:22:42,964 --> 01:22:45,466
He's decided to scare everybody.

1020
01:22:45,550 --> 01:22:48,219
You mean you like stories
where nothing happens too?

1021
01:22:49,554 --> 01:22:53,724
I'm putting all kinds of things
in this film.

1022
01:22:54,308 --> 01:22:55,935
Even a tap-dancing sailor.

1023
01:22:56,602 --> 01:22:58,062
Sailor, come here.

1024
01:22:58,813 --> 01:23:00,999
Show us what you learned in America.
No, I don't want water.

1025
01:23:01,023 --> 01:23:02,775
Dance and I'll give you a part.

1026
01:23:04,235 --> 01:23:05,403
Dance.

1027
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:15,746
Guido, what's going on?

1028
01:23:15,830 --> 01:23:19,625
Rossella, cut the big-sister tone.
It puts me off right away.

1029
01:23:21,085 --> 01:23:23,379
Mr. Director, what part do I play?

1030
01:23:29,177 --> 01:23:32,054
What does Luisa think about me?
What does she want?

1031
01:23:32,138 --> 01:23:34,849
- What's my part?
- Go away!

1032
01:23:36,517 --> 01:23:39,937
Luisa doesn't talk much.
Even to me, her best friend.

1033
01:23:40,605 --> 01:23:44,108
I really don't know what she wants.
She's lost.

1034
01:23:44,192 --> 01:23:46,611
One day she says one thing,
the next day something else.

1035
01:23:47,570 --> 01:23:49,947
Unfortunately,
I think the only thing she'd like

1036
01:23:50,031 --> 01:23:51,824
is for you to be different.

1037
01:23:51,908 --> 01:23:53,576
Why?

1038
01:23:53,659 --> 01:23:56,162
It's the mistake we all make.

1039
01:23:58,456 --> 01:24:02,960
Is that gentle fellow courting her?
Is he in love with her?

1040
01:24:03,044 --> 01:24:06,214
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
No more guilty conscience.

1041
01:24:06,881 --> 01:24:09,550
You're such a scoundrel.

1042
01:24:09,634 --> 01:24:11,552
Poor Enrico.

1043
01:24:11,636 --> 01:24:15,223
He's so clumsy at it
that everyone's noticed.

1044
01:24:15,306 --> 01:24:18,392
He hangs around her, listens to her,
keeps her company.

1045
01:24:18,476 --> 01:24:20,228
He's a wonderful friend.

1046
01:24:24,190 --> 01:24:26,150
I thought my ideas were so clear.

1047
01:24:27,485 --> 01:24:30,863
I wanted to make an honest film.
No lies whatsoever.

1048
01:24:31,948 --> 01:24:36,327
I thought I had something
so simple to say.

1049
01:24:37,495 --> 01:24:39,455
Something useful to everybody.

1050
01:24:39,538 --> 01:24:41,540
A film to help bury forever

1051
01:24:41,624 --> 01:24:44,210
all the dead things
we carry around inside.

1052
01:24:47,546 --> 01:24:51,050
Instead, it's me who lacks the courage
to bury anything at all.

1053
01:24:53,010 --> 01:24:56,222
Now I'm utterly confused,

1054
01:24:56,973 --> 01:24:58,474
with this tower on my hands.

1055
01:25:01,602 --> 01:25:03,854
I wonder why things turned out this way.

1056
01:25:06,148 --> 01:25:08,442
Where did I lose my way?

1057
01:25:11,279 --> 01:25:13,406
I really have nothing to say...

1058
01:25:14,448 --> 01:25:16,200
but I want to say it anyway.

1059
01:25:18,536 --> 01:25:21,330
Why don't those spirits of yours
come to my aid?

1060
01:25:22,164 --> 01:25:24,583
Let them get to work.

1061
01:25:24,667 --> 01:25:26,502
Let them get to work.

1062
01:25:26,585 --> 01:25:30,506
I've already told you,
your attitude is all wrong.

1063
01:25:30,589 --> 01:25:33,426
You're curious in a childish way.

1064
01:25:33,509 --> 01:25:35,594
You want too many guarantees.

1065
01:25:35,678 --> 01:25:39,598
- Fine, but what do they say?
- The same as always.

1066
01:25:40,433 --> 01:25:43,853
They're very reasonable.
They know you well.

1067
01:25:43,936 --> 01:25:45,229
Well, then?

1068
01:25:46,981 --> 01:25:51,193
They say you're free,
but you have to choose.

1069
01:25:51,277 --> 01:25:52,737
And you don't have much time.

1070
01:25:53,904 --> 01:25:55,364
You have to hurry.

1071
01:25:57,825 --> 01:25:59,243
Guido!

1072
01:26:01,162 --> 01:26:02,830
Are you two coming up?

1073
01:26:50,378 --> 01:26:53,172
<i>- Room 320, please.
- He is still out.</i>

1074
01:26:53,255 --> 01:26:54,673
I see. Thanks.

1075
01:27:38,092 --> 01:27:39,552
Have you got a headache?

1076
01:27:40,344 --> 01:27:42,430
No, it's a tranquilizer.

1077
01:27:42,513 --> 01:27:44,181
You take them often?

1078
01:27:45,433 --> 01:27:47,184
Sometimes, to help me sleep.

1079
01:27:50,354 --> 01:27:52,064
What's worrying you now?

1080
01:28:16,922 --> 01:28:17,923
What?

1081
01:28:18,007 --> 01:28:20,384
Nothing. If you could only see yourself.

1082
01:28:21,093 --> 01:28:22,636
Why are you laughing?

1083
01:28:22,720 --> 01:28:25,014
I don't think I could ever cheat on you,

1084
01:28:25,097 --> 01:28:27,725
if only because
I couldn't bear the absurdity,

1085
01:28:27,808 --> 01:28:31,687
the effort of having to hide and lie.

1086
01:28:31,770 --> 01:28:33,814
But it's obviously easy for you.

1087
01:28:34,565 --> 01:28:38,360
Listen, Luisa, I'm very happy you're here,

1088
01:28:38,444 --> 01:28:41,655
but I'm very tired and sleepy.

1089
01:28:46,035 --> 01:28:47,119
Then sleep.

1090
01:28:48,662 --> 01:28:49,747
Good night.

1091
01:28:56,045 --> 01:28:59,215
I don't know what you expect
to discover in my life by reducing it all

1092
01:28:59,298 --> 01:29:02,051
to the pettiness of somebody
stealing from a cookie jar.

1093
01:29:02,134 --> 01:29:05,846
What do you know about my life,
what I hate and what I don't?

1094
01:29:05,930 --> 01:29:07,932
I only know what you show me.

1095
01:29:11,936 --> 01:29:13,938
And what do I show you?

1096
01:29:14,772 --> 01:29:16,857
Tell me what you see.

1097
01:29:16,941 --> 01:29:20,027
Where do you hope to get
with your moral judgments?

1098
01:29:20,110 --> 01:29:21,737
Nowhere.

1099
01:29:21,820 --> 01:29:24,532
I know we've been stuck
in the same place for years.

1100
01:29:24,615 --> 01:29:26,343
You're the one who always
asks me to come back,

1101
01:29:26,367 --> 01:29:28,827
who thinks we can always start over.

1102
01:29:29,662 --> 01:29:32,414
Once and for all,
I don't want to start anything over.

1103
01:29:32,498 --> 01:29:34,291
Just what do you want?

1104
01:29:34,375 --> 01:29:37,920
Why did you ask me here?
What good am I to you?

1105
01:29:38,003 --> 01:29:41,006
What are you trying to get from me?
What is it you want?

1106
01:31:01,378 --> 01:31:02,671
Relax.

1107
01:31:02,755 --> 01:31:05,299
I spotted her last night
as soon as I got in.

1108
01:31:14,767 --> 01:31:17,019
I've asked no questions.
I don't want to know.

1109
01:31:17,102 --> 01:31:20,814
Just spare me the embarrassment
of hearing you swear to a lie again.

1110
01:31:25,653 --> 01:31:27,488
She must have been born in March or April.

1111
01:31:27,571 --> 01:31:30,491
She's a real Aries type.

1112
01:31:30,574 --> 01:31:32,743
I'll tell you what type she is.

1113
01:31:34,787 --> 01:31:37,706
Exactly the type to make a good companion

1114
01:31:37,790 --> 01:31:41,752
for feeble, spineless, confused men.

1115
01:31:42,961 --> 01:31:45,464
Luisa, I didn't know.

1116
01:31:45,547 --> 01:31:48,217
I'm seeing her for the first time,
like you.

1117
01:31:49,635 --> 01:31:52,513
Really, everybody comes to this place.

1118
01:31:52,596 --> 01:31:54,932
It's no surprise
to run into the poor thing here.

1119
01:31:57,685 --> 01:32:00,896
So that's why you've been
tormenting me since last night.

1120
01:32:00,979 --> 01:32:02,690
Why didn't you just come out and say it?

1121
01:32:05,150 --> 01:32:07,778
What offends me most
is that people could think

1122
01:32:07,861 --> 01:32:10,447
I'd go around with somebody
who dresses like that.

1123
01:32:10,531 --> 01:32:11,824
Have you seen her getup?

1124
01:32:11,907 --> 01:32:13,701
Let's go for a walk.

1125
01:32:13,784 --> 01:32:15,244
Let's drop this now.

1126
01:32:15,327 --> 01:32:17,746
It's been over for three years.
Finished. Enough.

1127
01:32:21,125 --> 01:32:22,668
He drives me crazy.

1128
01:32:23,669 --> 01:32:26,547
He acts as if he's telling
the God's honest truth.

1129
01:32:26,630 --> 01:32:28,841
Look at him. He thinks he's in the right.

1130
01:32:30,467 --> 01:32:32,761
How can you live this way?

1131
01:32:34,847 --> 01:32:36,348
It's not right to lie all the time,

1132
01:32:36,432 --> 01:32:38,642
never letting others know
what's true or false.

1133
01:32:38,726 --> 01:32:40,811
Is it really all the same to you?

1134
01:32:41,562 --> 01:32:44,898
Forgive me. I know. I'm being a real pain.

1135
01:32:46,150 --> 01:32:49,778
How sad to play the middle-class wife
who doesn't understand.

1136
01:32:50,904 --> 01:32:54,950
Tell me what I should do.
I can't laugh about it like you.

1137
01:32:55,033 --> 01:32:57,327
Sweetie, I'm not laughing.

1138
01:32:59,538 --> 01:33:02,207
What do you talk to her about?

1139
01:33:07,129 --> 01:33:10,507
What disgusts me most
is that you've mixed her up in our life.

1140
01:33:10,591 --> 01:33:12,843
She knows everything about you and me.

1141
01:33:14,261 --> 01:33:15,679
That whore.

1142
01:33:16,513 --> 01:33:17,765
Cow!

1143
01:33:20,809 --> 01:33:23,228
You're the real pain, you know.

1144
01:33:31,236 --> 01:33:32,571
And yet...

1145
01:33:55,803 --> 01:33:58,263
Signora Carla, you sing so beautifully.

1146
01:33:58,847 --> 01:34:00,516
No, I'm just an amateur.

1147
01:34:00,599 --> 01:34:02,226
And how pretty you are.

1148
01:34:03,268 --> 01:34:05,813
- I've wanted to meet you for so long.
- Same here.

1149
01:34:13,028 --> 01:34:14,363
You're so stylish.

1150
01:34:14,446 --> 01:34:16,365
You're the stylish one.

1151
01:34:16,448 --> 01:34:18,450
Frankly, I'm a bit trashy.

1152
01:34:18,534 --> 01:34:20,619
Nonsense! You're very refined.

1153
01:34:20,702 --> 01:34:23,288
You like it?
It's a little outfit I saw in <i>Vogue.</i>

1154
01:34:23,372 --> 01:34:25,249
It took me forever to find it.

1155
01:34:25,332 --> 01:34:28,293
But when Carla gets an idea in her head —.

1156
01:34:42,099 --> 01:34:44,184
Here he comes!

1157
01:34:45,769 --> 01:34:47,229
Guido's here!

1158
01:34:48,272 --> 01:34:52,276
Good evening, ladies.
Close the doors. There's a blizzard.

1159
01:34:53,277 --> 01:34:54,278
How are you? Well?

1160
01:34:54,361 --> 01:34:58,115
Every package has a name on it.
Don't mix them up.

1161
01:34:58,198 --> 01:34:59,867
This is for Caterina.

1162
01:35:00,659 --> 01:35:01,743
He's a darling!

1163
01:35:02,286 --> 01:35:03,954
For my dear sister-in-law,

1164
01:35:04,037 --> 01:35:07,541
who finally likes me
and understands how things should be.

1165
01:35:07,624 --> 01:35:09,376
We'll draw your bath right away.

1166
01:35:09,459 --> 01:35:11,378
Gloria, this is you-know-what.

1167
01:35:11,461 --> 01:35:14,715
Thank you. I must speak to you, Guido.

1168
01:35:15,173 --> 01:35:17,426
I know what she wants to tell you.

1169
01:35:17,509 --> 01:35:20,095
We'll have to send her away now.
She's acting jealous.

1170
01:35:20,178 --> 01:35:22,681
What were you doing upstairs?

1171
01:35:22,764 --> 01:35:24,266
I went to see those poor things.

1172
01:35:24,349 --> 01:35:26,518
They'd be alone all the time
if not for me.

1173
01:35:26,602 --> 01:35:28,562
The role doesn't suit her.

1174
01:35:28,645 --> 01:35:30,564
She's just a middle-class woman
with no style.

1175
01:35:30,647 --> 01:35:34,318
Leave him alone now. He's tired.
He has to take his bath.

1176
01:35:34,401 --> 01:35:37,321
Guido, it's splendid.
I've always wanted one like it.

1177
01:35:37,404 --> 01:35:40,407
Gloria, Carla, Hedy! Get the buckets!

1178
01:35:43,076 --> 01:35:44,828
Guido, my husband wrote.

1179
01:35:44,912 --> 01:35:48,206
He wants me home for New Year's,
just for a day.

1180
01:35:48,290 --> 01:35:50,751
- If you mind, I'll tell him I can't.
- No, that's fine.

1181
01:35:51,585 --> 01:35:52,794
Come on, Carlotta.

1182
01:35:56,757 --> 01:36:00,177
- Who's that little Black girl?
- A surprise from us. From Hawaii.

1183
01:36:00,260 --> 01:36:01,720
Don't you remember her?

1184
01:36:03,472 --> 01:36:05,515
You always talked about her.

1185
01:36:11,021 --> 01:36:13,440
Thank you, Luisa. You're so kind.

1186
01:36:13,523 --> 01:36:15,484
What a sweet thought.

1187
01:36:22,824 --> 01:36:25,953
- That tiara is mine.
- I know. I'll give it back.

1188
01:36:28,622 --> 01:36:29,873
Oh, darling.

1189
01:36:30,582 --> 01:36:32,960
What a thrill to find you here.

1190
01:36:33,043 --> 01:36:35,379
- How are you?
- Fine.

1191
01:36:35,462 --> 01:36:39,383
But tell me, lovely lady, who are you?

1192
01:36:39,466 --> 01:36:42,678
The name doesn't matter.
I'm happy to be here.

1193
01:36:42,761 --> 01:36:45,263
- Don't ask me any questions.
- May I stay?

1194
01:36:45,347 --> 01:36:47,057
Of course, you pretty thing.

1195
01:36:48,308 --> 01:36:49,977
But I'm busy now.

1196
01:36:50,060 --> 01:36:51,311
What about later?

1197
01:36:54,022 --> 01:36:56,274
Rossella? What are you doing here?

1198
01:36:56,358 --> 01:36:58,652
Playing Pinocchio's talking cricket.
You mind?

1199
01:36:58,735 --> 01:37:00,153
No. But why are you laughing?

1200
01:37:00,237 --> 01:37:03,156
No reason.
I just want to see how you manage.

1201
01:37:03,240 --> 01:37:06,743
You finally have your harem, King Solomon.

1202
01:37:06,827 --> 01:37:08,620
- Wasn't it about time?
- Sure.

1203
01:37:12,958 --> 01:37:14,418
Put me in.

1204
01:37:14,876 --> 01:37:18,422
Guido, aren't you a little afraid?

1205
01:37:18,505 --> 01:37:20,841
Of what? Everything's going fine.

1206
01:37:20,924 --> 01:37:23,010
May I stay too? It's such fun.

1207
01:37:23,093 --> 01:37:24,773
I don't want anything.
I'll just watch you.

1208
01:37:24,803 --> 01:37:26,972
Do you know the rule? It must be obeyed.

1209
01:37:27,055 --> 01:37:28,390
Come help me.

1210
01:37:30,642 --> 01:37:34,771
It's a two-piece outfit in busby
with ostrich feathers. Like it?

1211
01:37:34,855 --> 01:37:37,983
Ah, hello, Hedy. It's beautiful.

1212
01:37:38,650 --> 01:37:40,193
What's this rule?

1213
01:37:40,277 --> 01:37:41,486
I don't know.

1214
01:37:41,570 --> 01:37:43,488
He promised me a part in his movie

1215
01:37:43,572 --> 01:37:46,074
and said there'd be
a lot of costume changes.

1216
01:37:50,996 --> 01:37:53,498
That's enough now, girls. Get me out.

1217
01:37:55,459 --> 01:37:58,295
- Gloria, the talcum powder.
- Ah, yes.

1218
01:38:00,505 --> 01:38:03,216
She prepared something
just the way you like it.

1219
01:38:03,300 --> 01:38:05,343
- Really?
- A cake.

1220
01:38:05,427 --> 01:38:08,096
- Are you happy, girls?
- Of course.

1221
01:38:08,180 --> 01:38:09,973
Isn't this just what you've always wanted?

1222
01:38:10,057 --> 01:38:11,183
It certainly is.

1223
01:38:11,266 --> 01:38:13,435
Isn't he the best little boy in the world?

1224
01:38:13,518 --> 01:38:15,479
Nadine, hurry up with the powder.

1225
01:38:15,562 --> 01:38:18,982
Nadine! What was it you used to say
in Copenhagen?

1226
01:38:19,066 --> 01:38:22,194
We're delighted to invite our passengers

1227
01:38:22,277 --> 01:38:24,488
to spend the night in Copenhagen.

1228
01:38:24,821 --> 01:38:27,240
Listen to that voice, girls.

1229
01:38:27,324 --> 01:38:30,619
The company will pay all expenses.

1230
01:38:30,702 --> 01:38:33,538
A wonderful night to all of you.

1231
01:38:39,336 --> 01:38:41,546
Madeleine, come help us.

1232
01:38:41,630 --> 01:38:44,382
- Saraghina.
- Here I am. I'll carry Guido.

1233
01:38:44,466 --> 01:38:47,886
The poor man!
The scalding water turned him all red!

1234
01:38:47,969 --> 01:38:49,513
Such nice thin legs.

1235
01:38:49,596 --> 01:38:52,557
Straight as when he was a boy.

1236
01:38:52,641 --> 01:38:55,477
He acts like a little boy,
but he's really very complex.

1237
01:38:55,560 --> 01:38:57,854
Don't be fooled. He's a hypocrite.

1238
01:38:57,938 --> 01:38:59,314
No, he's not.

1239
01:38:59,397 --> 01:39:02,943
Why should he explain to strangers?
He knows how to protect us.

1240
01:39:03,985 --> 01:39:06,446
Guido, help!

1241
01:39:06,530 --> 01:39:08,782
- Who's screaming like that?
- Jacqueline.

1242
01:39:08,865 --> 01:39:11,451
She refuses to go upstairs
with the older women,

1243
01:39:11,535 --> 01:39:13,078
so we put her in the cellar.

1244
01:39:13,161 --> 01:39:14,704
This is scandalous!

1245
01:39:14,788 --> 01:39:18,291
I don't want to speak to those hags.
They're all older than me.

1246
01:39:18,375 --> 01:39:20,085
I'm 26.

1247
01:39:20,168 --> 01:39:22,337
You can check
with the Paris public registry.

1248
01:39:22,838 --> 01:39:26,007
Jacqueline Bonbon, 26.

1249
01:39:26,091 --> 01:39:29,219
July 4, 1938.

1250
01:39:29,302 --> 01:39:31,972
You have no right to send me upstairs.

1251
01:39:32,055 --> 01:39:33,557
It's not my time yet.

1252
01:39:33,640 --> 01:39:36,601
Look how agile I am. Look at these legs.

1253
01:39:37,227 --> 01:39:39,312
Which of you has
such a firm little bottom?

1254
01:39:39,396 --> 01:39:40,814
Look at this bosom.

1255
01:39:40,897 --> 01:39:44,067
Guido, don't send me upstairs.

1256
01:39:44,151 --> 01:39:46,820
I don't want to go upstairs.

1257
01:39:46,903 --> 01:39:48,280
It's the rule,

1258
01:39:48,363 --> 01:39:50,574
and the rule is the rule.

1259
01:39:51,491 --> 01:39:53,618
Calm down. It's nice upstairs too.

1260
01:39:53,702 --> 01:39:54,744
It's not true!

1261
01:39:54,828 --> 01:39:57,164
Your earring.

1262
01:39:59,791 --> 01:40:01,710
You've always been fond of me.

1263
01:40:01,793 --> 01:40:04,754
Please tell him to give me an extension.

1264
01:40:04,838 --> 01:40:07,507
Guido, couldn't you give
Jacqueline an extension?

1265
01:40:07,591 --> 01:40:10,051
Now you're breaking my balls too?

1266
01:40:10,135 --> 01:40:13,763
I beg you. Just for a year, Guido.

1267
01:40:13,847 --> 01:40:15,140
No extension!

1268
01:40:15,223 --> 01:40:17,392
- I won't go upstairs.
- What's that?

1269
01:40:17,475 --> 01:40:19,269
- I won't go.
- Say that again if you dare.

1270
01:40:19,352 --> 01:40:20,937
I won't go upstairs!

1271
01:40:21,021 --> 01:40:25,066
She's crazy. I told you
we should never have taken her in.

1272
01:40:25,150 --> 01:40:27,277
Learn the rules, sister.

1273
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:30,363
"Whoever exceeds the age limit
shall go to the upper floor,

1274
01:40:30,447 --> 01:40:32,049
where she will be treated equally well"...

1275
01:40:32,073 --> 01:40:33,658
"and bask in her memories."

1276
01:40:33,742 --> 01:40:37,412
- It's disgusting and absurd.
- We should never have agreed to it.

1277
01:40:42,584 --> 01:40:44,628
It's not fair!

1278
01:40:45,086 --> 01:40:48,882
A rule laid down by a man
who fails the test himself.

1279
01:40:48,965 --> 01:40:51,927
A real man loves women
with no regard to their age.

1280
01:40:52,010 --> 01:40:54,804
In France, such a man
would be the shame of the nation.

1281
01:40:54,888 --> 01:40:56,973
Are we lemons to squeeze and toss out?

1282
01:40:57,057 --> 01:41:00,018
- Guido, they're so right.
- You're a monster!

1283
01:41:02,812 --> 01:41:04,689
The hour of liberation has come!

1284
01:41:04,773 --> 01:41:07,692
Hooray for Jacqueline
who showed us the way to freedom!

1285
01:41:07,776 --> 01:41:10,570
Down with the tyrant! Down with Bluebeard!

1286
01:41:10,654 --> 01:41:13,949
We have the right to be loved
until we're 70 years old!

1287
01:41:16,660 --> 01:41:18,411
Down with Guido!

1288
01:41:18,495 --> 01:41:19,955
You think you're a young man?

1289
01:41:20,038 --> 01:41:23,124
Let's make this clear.
He doesn't know how to make love!

1290
01:41:23,208 --> 01:41:25,252
He's all words and caresses.

1291
01:41:25,335 --> 01:41:27,855
- And he falls asleep right away.
- I'm not sleeping. I'm thinking.

1292
01:41:27,879 --> 01:41:30,674
Guido, don't send us upstairs
when we get old.

1293
01:41:30,757 --> 01:41:32,425
That's enough! Down!

1294
01:41:34,761 --> 01:41:37,264
Quick! They're revolting upstairs too!

1295
01:41:41,893 --> 01:41:44,646
Oh, delicious!

1296
01:41:45,689 --> 01:41:46,815
Bastard! Liar!

1297
01:41:46,898 --> 01:41:49,192
I came all the way from Paris. What's my —.

1298
01:41:50,235 --> 01:41:51,778
What's my part?

1299
01:41:52,696 --> 01:41:54,823
What's my role in the film?

1300
01:41:57,617 --> 01:41:59,369
You liked when I danced the conga.

1301
01:41:59,452 --> 01:42:01,329
I don't like it anymore.

1302
01:42:01,413 --> 01:42:03,832
Luisa, help!

1303
01:42:03,915 --> 01:42:06,126
No, my dear.
This is my husband's business.

1304
01:42:06,209 --> 01:42:09,087
If that's his decision,
that's how it is. It's the rule.

1305
01:42:09,170 --> 01:42:11,965
Guido, hurry up. The soup's getting cold.

1306
01:42:12,048 --> 01:42:13,758
Can't you see I'm busy?

1307
01:42:14,801 --> 01:42:16,636
What an extraordinary man.

1308
01:42:17,721 --> 01:42:21,057
He needs to act this way.
He does it almost every night.

1309
01:42:23,435 --> 01:42:26,354
Guido, don't you remember me?

1310
01:42:27,230 --> 01:42:29,816
Darling, you're hurt.
I'll get you some cream.

1311
01:42:29,899 --> 01:42:31,359
- No cream.
- Some balm.

1312
01:42:31,443 --> 01:42:33,028
- No balm.
- Some drops.

1313
01:42:33,111 --> 01:42:35,905
He doesn't toss you out
like squeezed lemons.

1314
01:42:35,989 --> 01:42:37,824
He'd like to keep you all forever.

1315
01:42:37,907 --> 01:42:40,535
The truth is, he's too good, too patient.

1316
01:42:44,372 --> 01:42:46,624
No, Guido...

1317
01:43:05,185 --> 01:43:06,811
He doesn't like you!

1318
01:43:07,479 --> 01:43:08,772
You're old!

1319
01:43:10,690 --> 01:43:14,694
Dear Jacqueline, we're happy
we had the chance to live with you,

1320
01:43:14,778 --> 01:43:18,031
and we wish you the best of luck upstairs.

1321
01:43:18,114 --> 01:43:19,824
We assure you on Guido's behalf

1322
01:43:19,908 --> 01:43:22,369
that you were
the first showgirl in his life.

1323
01:43:23,203 --> 01:43:27,499
You're now entitled to a last song
and dance of your choice,

1324
01:43:27,582 --> 01:43:29,626
with your own spotlight.

1325
01:43:30,668 --> 01:43:33,171
Thank you, girls. You're so good to me.

1326
01:43:33,254 --> 01:43:35,715
Shall I sing a love song?

1327
01:43:35,799 --> 01:43:38,927
No, better something sexy.
That was my specialty.

1328
01:43:39,010 --> 01:43:41,805
Guido, remember
the Apollo Theater in Bologna?

1329
01:43:41,888 --> 01:43:42,972
I remember.

1330
01:43:43,056 --> 01:43:44,766
No, better a happy song!

1331
01:43:52,857 --> 01:43:54,484
I dropped my pearls.

1332
01:44:04,994 --> 01:44:06,579
Again!

1333
01:44:15,255 --> 01:44:17,173
You're not even listening.

1334
01:44:32,689 --> 01:44:33,815
Farewell, Guido.

1335
01:44:47,579 --> 01:44:48,872
Farewell!

1336
01:45:04,554 --> 01:45:07,807
I thought it was
such an amusing situation,

1337
01:45:07,891 --> 01:45:10,894
possibly even
the funniest part of my story.

1338
01:45:11,853 --> 01:45:15,190
I'd even prepared a little speech
to give at the table.

1339
01:45:16,524 --> 01:45:18,318
It went like this.

1340
01:45:18,401 --> 01:45:22,447
"My darlings, happiness consists
in being able to speak the truth

1341
01:45:22,530 --> 01:45:24,574
without ever making anybody suffer."

1342
01:45:25,783 --> 01:45:28,828
Carla would have played the harp,
like every evening,

1343
01:45:28,912 --> 01:45:31,664
and we'd have been happy hidden away here,

1344
01:45:31,748 --> 01:45:33,791
far from the world.

1345
01:45:33,875 --> 01:45:35,460
All of you and me.

1346
01:45:37,253 --> 01:45:38,838
What's wrong?

1347
01:45:40,340 --> 01:45:42,717
Why this sadness?

1348
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:46,095
See? We've made him feel guilty.

1349
01:45:56,439 --> 01:45:59,484
No, Guido, it's been a wonderful evening.

1350
01:45:59,567 --> 01:46:01,194
You mustn't be sad.

1351
01:46:03,112 --> 01:46:04,489
Do you need anything?

1352
01:46:08,576 --> 01:46:10,286
Now they'll all go off to bed...

1353
01:46:11,829 --> 01:46:14,249
while I still have lots to do.

1354
01:46:15,458 --> 01:46:17,752
There's laundry to do,

1355
01:46:17,835 --> 01:46:19,295
the dishes to wash...

1356
01:46:20,296 --> 01:46:22,799
sheets to mend,

1357
01:46:22,882 --> 01:46:24,717
floors to scrub

1358
01:46:24,801 --> 01:46:27,053
and tomorrow's breakfast to prepare.

1359
01:46:34,060 --> 01:46:36,729
We're happy living all together
like this, aren't we?

1360
01:46:38,773 --> 01:46:41,568
At first I didn't understand...

1361
01:46:42,610 --> 01:46:46,239
that this is how things are meant to be.

1362
01:46:46,322 --> 01:46:47,824
But now...

1363
01:46:48,366 --> 01:46:50,410
Aren't I a good girl?

1364
01:46:50,493 --> 01:46:53,121
I don't pester you anymore.
I don't ask questions.

1365
01:46:56,958 --> 01:46:58,668
I was a little dense, wasn't I?

1366
01:46:59,836 --> 01:47:02,046
It took me 20 years to understand.

1367
01:47:02,130 --> 01:47:03,298
Twenty years...

1368
01:47:04,299 --> 01:47:06,259
since the day we got married...

1369
01:47:08,136 --> 01:47:11,222
and you became my husband
and I your wife.

1370
01:47:13,433 --> 01:47:16,352
You remember that day, Guido?

1371
01:47:19,439 --> 01:47:22,609
If you could just be patient
a little longer, Luisa.

1372
01:47:23,776 --> 01:47:25,445
But perhaps you've had it.

1373
01:47:26,237 --> 01:47:29,907
Frankly, I wish I could have
offered a word of advice.

1374
01:47:30,700 --> 01:47:35,663
But now I understand
that you're trying to solve a problem

1375
01:47:35,747 --> 01:47:37,067
for which there is no solution...

1376
01:47:37,415 --> 01:47:41,586
To find clearly defined faces
for a crowd of characters

1377
01:47:41,669 --> 01:47:43,963
who in your script are so rough,

1378
01:47:44,047 --> 01:47:46,174
so vague, so ephemeral.

1379
01:47:46,257 --> 01:47:49,177
- What are we watching?
- I don't know. Screen tests.

1380
01:47:50,637 --> 01:47:53,264
- You're not feeling well.
- I'm perfectly fine.

1381
01:47:59,979 --> 01:48:02,732
Agostini, do a little dance on the ramp.

1382
01:48:02,815 --> 01:48:04,817
I'll accompany you on the piano.

1383
01:48:06,194 --> 01:48:07,820
Listen to this. "The solitary ego

1384
01:48:07,904 --> 01:48:10,698
that revolves around itself
and feeds only upon itself

1385
01:48:10,782 --> 01:48:14,077
finally chokes on a great cry
or a great laugh."

1386
01:48:14,160 --> 01:48:17,997
Stendhal wrote that
during his stay in Italy.

1387
01:48:18,081 --> 01:48:22,627
If we'd only read those sayings
on chocolate wrappers sometimes,

1388
01:48:22,710 --> 01:48:24,921
we'd be spared many an illusion.

1389
01:48:54,701 --> 01:48:56,077
There he is.

1390
01:48:56,160 --> 01:48:59,414
By the exit, always ready to run away, eh?

1391
01:49:02,917 --> 01:49:04,836
Good evening to all. Sorry I'm late.

1392
01:49:05,878 --> 01:49:07,880
What are you doing up there?

1393
01:49:08,423 --> 01:49:09,841
- Guido, where are you?
- Up here.

1394
01:49:09,924 --> 01:49:11,884
- Come down.
- I'd rather stay here.

1395
01:49:11,968 --> 01:49:14,929
Evening, ma'am.
Good, you can help us too.

1396
01:49:15,012 --> 01:49:16,681
- Let's get going.
- Yes, sir.

1397
01:49:16,764 --> 01:49:19,767
They canceled the variety act tonight
just for us.

1398
01:49:21,811 --> 01:49:23,146
Let's go!

1399
01:49:23,813 --> 01:49:26,107
Young man, it's time to make up your mind.

1400
01:49:26,190 --> 01:49:27,942
I brought all the screen tests —.

1401
01:49:28,025 --> 01:49:30,945
Listen, there's no more time
for fooling around.

1402
01:49:31,028 --> 01:49:34,699
He had all the time he wanted
for doubts, second thoughts and whims.

1403
01:49:34,782 --> 01:49:36,993
- Tonight he has to choose.
- That's why we're here.

1404
01:49:37,076 --> 01:49:38,244
Exactly.

1405
01:49:38,327 --> 01:49:41,372
Conocchia got all the screen tests
from Rome,

1406
01:49:41,456 --> 01:49:43,541
even the ones shot five months ago.

1407
01:49:43,624 --> 01:49:45,585
We'll go through them one by one,

1408
01:49:45,668 --> 01:49:48,129
and you'll say, "This is the mistress,
this is the wife,

1409
01:49:48,212 --> 01:49:49,852
this is the cardinal, this is Saraghina."

1410
01:49:49,881 --> 01:49:51,174
Clear?

1411
01:49:51,716 --> 01:49:54,719
I don't want to be the laughingstock
of the Italian film industry,

1412
01:49:54,802 --> 01:49:57,430
and I especially don't want you to be.

1413
01:49:57,513 --> 01:49:59,307
They've all got you in their sights.

1414
01:49:59,390 --> 01:50:02,351
You have few friends left
on the Left or the Right,

1415
01:50:02,435 --> 01:50:05,563
but I'm here to help you every way I can.

1416
01:50:05,646 --> 01:50:08,065
But we must start shooting immediately.

1417
01:50:08,149 --> 01:50:09,317
Roll the screen tests.

1418
01:50:12,987 --> 01:50:14,363
<i>Screen test, Miss Olimpia.</i>

1419
01:50:16,365 --> 01:50:17,575
<i>Come in, Olimpia.</i>

1420
01:50:20,203 --> 01:50:21,788
<i>- Should I shut it?
- Yes.</i>

1421
01:50:21,871 --> 01:50:25,458
<i>Sway your hips as you walk.</i>

1422
01:50:26,042 --> 01:50:27,460
<i>Put your things down there.</i>

1423
01:50:28,795 --> 01:50:30,671
<i>Now go over to the mirror.</i>

1424
01:50:32,298 --> 01:50:33,966
<i>Admire yourself.</i>

1425
01:50:34,634 --> 01:50:36,260
<i>More pleased with yourself.</i>

1426
01:50:37,345 --> 01:50:39,013
<i>Swell out your chest.</i>

1427
01:50:40,097 --> 01:50:43,059
<i>Good. Now go over to the phone slowly.</i>

1428
01:50:44,101 --> 01:50:46,312
- <i>Why are you running?
- / 'm not.</i>

1429
01:50:46,395 --> 01:50:49,315
<i>Go up to that mark on the floor.</i>

1430
01:50:50,942 --> 01:50:53,319
<i>May I have the concierge, please?</i>

1431
01:50:53,402 --> 01:50:54,570
<i>Speaking.</i>

1432
01:50:54,654 --> 01:50:59,075
<i>- I'd like some uncarbonated water.
- Very well. Fiuggi.</i>

1433
01:50:59,158 --> 01:51:02,745
<i>- No, Fiuggi is carbonated.
- No. Look this way.</i>

1434
01:51:02,829 --> 01:51:05,832
<i>- Fiuggi is the least carbonated.
- Fine. Fiuggi then.</i>

1435
01:51:05,915 --> 01:51:07,625
Will this one do, Guido?

1436
01:51:07,708 --> 01:51:10,628
He has to decide.
She leaves for England next week.

1437
01:51:10,711 --> 01:51:12,255
She leaves next week.

1438
01:51:12,338 --> 01:51:13,631
- Who is she?
- Be quiet.

1439
01:51:13,714 --> 01:51:15,216
Or do you prefer this one?

1440
01:51:15,299 --> 01:51:18,302
This is an important character.
You have to like her right away.

1441
01:51:18,386 --> 01:51:19,595
Right, Guido?

1442
01:51:23,140 --> 01:51:25,059
<i>Sit down as if exhausted.</i>

1443
01:51:25,142 --> 01:51:28,855
<i>This is a woman
who has lost her will to fight.</i>

1444
01:51:28,938 --> 01:51:30,606
<i>Say your lines.</i>

1445
01:51:30,690 --> 01:51:33,568
<i>- Without stopping?
- Yes.</i>

1446
01:51:36,904 --> 01:51:39,907
<i>I'm the one who's offering you
total freedom.</i>

1447
01:51:40,741 --> 01:51:43,786
<i>I'm no good to you this way.
I'm just a nuisance.</i>

1448
01:51:44,579 --> 01:51:46,622
<i>Please give it some serious thought.</i>

1449
01:51:48,332 --> 01:51:51,043
Who's she supposed to be?

1450
01:51:51,127 --> 01:51:53,212
Didn't you hear? She's the wife.

1451
01:51:53,296 --> 01:51:57,383
<i>Relax. We're all friends here.
You knew the lines before.</i>

1452
01:51:57,466 --> 01:52:01,721
Still, she's likable, soulful.
Don't you think?

1453
01:52:01,804 --> 01:52:05,224
- Give me a cigarette.
- I'm all out. Enrico, supplies!

1454
01:52:05,892 --> 01:52:07,852
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

1455
01:52:07,935 --> 01:52:09,353
You're welcome.

1456
01:52:10,354 --> 01:52:13,983
<i>- I can't go on like this.
- Now, tell me how I should be.</i>

1457
01:52:14,525 --> 01:52:18,112
<i>Someone who doesn't constantly lie
while swearing he's telling the truth.</i>

1458
01:52:18,195 --> 01:52:21,449
<i>That would be enough.
It's not the actual things that you do.</i>

1459
01:52:21,532 --> 01:52:24,410
<i>It's never knowing the truth,</i>

1460
01:52:24,493 --> 01:52:26,579
<i>even about the smallest things.</i>

1461
01:52:27,455 --> 01:52:29,790
Luisa, I love you.

1462
01:52:30,291 --> 01:52:33,294
<i>- Lying is like breathing to you.
- Repeat that.</i>

1463
01:52:33,377 --> 01:52:34,962
<i>Lying is like breathing to you.</i>

1464
01:52:36,797 --> 01:52:38,299
The nerve!

1465
01:52:41,552 --> 01:52:43,763
- All right out of his life.
- Of course.

1466
01:52:43,846 --> 01:52:47,099
This is the princess. I know her.

1467
01:52:48,184 --> 01:52:49,435
<i>Aren't I alone already?</i>

1468
01:52:49,518 --> 01:52:52,355
<i>What do you give me?
What can I look forward to?</i>

1469
01:52:52,438 --> 01:52:54,815
<i>Look this way. Put on your glasses.</i>

1470
01:52:55,733 --> 01:52:58,569
<i>Repeat the last line.
"Aren't I alone already?"</i>

1471
01:52:58,653 --> 01:53:00,196
<i>Say it aggressively,</i>

1472
01:53:00,279 --> 01:53:03,074
<i>but also with deep bitterness.</i>

1473
01:53:03,157 --> 01:53:06,994
<i>"He said, " You want a separation?</i>

1474
01:53:07,078 --> 01:53:08,621
<i>What would you do all alone?"</i>

1475
01:53:08,704 --> 01:53:12,249
<i>And you answer, "Aren't I alone already?"</i>

1476
01:53:12,667 --> 01:53:14,251
<i>Go ahead.</i>

1477
01:53:14,335 --> 01:53:17,380
Guido, there's no doubt about this one.
She's perfect.

1478
01:53:23,177 --> 01:53:25,763
We've gone on like this for five months.

1479
01:53:26,180 --> 01:53:28,057
They're all so old.

1480
01:53:30,059 --> 01:53:31,268
<i>Fiuggi is carbonated.</i>

1481
01:53:31,352 --> 01:53:34,939
<i>No, it's the least sparkling. Louder.</i>

1482
01:53:35,022 --> 01:53:36,691
<i>Fine. Send up the Fiuggi.</i>

1483
01:53:36,774 --> 01:53:37,942
<i>Hang up the phone.</i>

1484
01:53:38,943 --> 01:53:40,945
<i>Screen test, Miss Olimpia.</i>

1485
01:53:41,821 --> 01:53:44,073
What about this one?

1486
01:53:44,156 --> 01:53:45,825
<i>More seductively.</i>

1487
01:53:45,908 --> 01:53:48,661
<i>It's dangerous leaving me alone.</i>

1488
01:53:49,370 --> 01:53:52,331
<i>- Why? What do you do?
- Should I repeat the line?</i>

1489
01:53:52,415 --> 01:53:54,041
<i>No, put down the phone.</i>

1490
01:53:54,917 --> 01:53:58,546
<i>Turn your head this way. Great. Cut.</i>

1491
01:53:59,463 --> 01:54:01,465
Luisa, where are you going?

1492
01:54:02,717 --> 01:54:05,261
Back to the hotel. I'm sleepy. Good night.

1493
01:54:05,344 --> 01:54:06,721
Wait a second. Listen.

1494
01:54:07,096 --> 01:54:08,514
What's wrong? What happened?

1495
01:54:08,597 --> 01:54:10,307
Nothing happened.

1496
01:54:10,391 --> 01:54:12,476
Nothing ever happens between you and me.

1497
01:54:13,853 --> 01:54:16,814
Did something you saw offend you?
It's just a movie.

1498
01:54:16,897 --> 01:54:19,692
Oh, I know that better than anyone.

1499
01:54:19,775 --> 01:54:22,111
Another fiction, another lie.

1500
01:54:22,194 --> 01:54:24,864
You put all of us in it,
but the way it suits you.

1501
01:54:24,947 --> 01:54:28,242
But the truth is something else entirely,
and only I know the truth.

1502
01:54:28,325 --> 01:54:30,661
You're lucky I'd never have the nerve

1503
01:54:30,745 --> 01:54:33,080
to make it public the way you do.

1504
01:54:33,164 --> 01:54:36,208
- Go on, make your movie!
- No, I won't.

1505
01:54:36,292 --> 01:54:38,753
Indulge yourself. Stroke your ego.

1506
01:54:39,628 --> 01:54:42,173
Make everyone think you're so wonderful.

1507
01:54:42,256 --> 01:54:44,633
But what could you have to say
to strangers

1508
01:54:44,717 --> 01:54:47,136
when you can't tell the truth
to the one closest to you,

1509
01:54:47,219 --> 01:54:48,697
the woman who's grown old at your side?

1510
01:54:48,721 --> 01:54:50,848
Luisa, cut the melodrama.

1511
01:54:53,517 --> 01:54:56,103
You were right to ask me to come.

1512
01:54:56,187 --> 01:54:58,981
We needed an ending.

1513
01:54:59,065 --> 01:55:01,692
I assure you, I won't be coming back.

1514
01:55:01,776 --> 01:55:03,235
You can go to hell!

1515
01:55:16,248 --> 01:55:20,086
<i>That's it. Run! Faster!</i>

1516
01:55:20,169 --> 01:55:22,338
<i>The man said to run!</i>

1517
01:55:22,421 --> 01:55:23,964
<i>You keep quiet!</i>

1518
01:55:25,716 --> 01:55:27,843
<i>Throw that ignoramus out!</i>

1519
01:55:27,927 --> 01:55:29,553
<i>Now sing, ma'am.</i>

1520
01:55:30,096 --> 01:55:34,809
You may say I'm losing my marbles,
but the figures are all right here.

1521
01:55:34,892 --> 01:55:38,395
No, I'll never pay this!
You are losing your marbles.

1522
01:55:38,479 --> 01:55:41,440
<i>Saraghina, look. We've got the money.</i>

1523
01:55:41,941 --> 01:55:44,110
<i>Saraghina, the rumba!</i>

1524
01:55:44,193 --> 01:55:47,571
Guido, would you please say something?

1525
01:55:49,323 --> 01:55:50,908
What about this one?

1526
01:55:51,867 --> 01:55:55,704
Frankly, I preferred the one before.
She's from Naples, isn't she?

1527
01:55:55,788 --> 01:55:59,875
Can't you see that I'm stammering?

1528
01:55:59,959 --> 01:56:03,420
<i>When are you coming? I'm tired of waiting.</i>

1529
01:56:03,504 --> 01:56:04,505
<i>Look at me.</i>

1530
01:56:04,588 --> 01:56:07,133
<i>Don't leave me alone.
You know it's dangerous.</i>

1531
01:56:07,216 --> 01:56:08,300
<i>Turn around.</i>

1532
01:56:08,384 --> 01:56:11,720
<i>Don't leave me alone.
You know it's dangerous, darling.</i>

1533
01:56:11,804 --> 01:56:12,805
<i>Look over here.</i>

1534
01:56:12,888 --> 01:56:16,559
<i>Why don't you come right away?
You're making me wait.</i>

1535
01:56:16,642 --> 01:56:18,769
<i>You know it's dangerous
when I have to wait.</i>

1536
01:56:18,853 --> 01:56:20,646
<i>Louder! Louder!</i>

1537
01:56:21,564 --> 01:56:23,607
<i>Countess, walk.</i>

1538
01:56:23,691 --> 01:56:25,484
<i>I said to walk.</i>

1539
01:56:25,568 --> 01:56:27,528
<i>Don't touch me with your hand.</i>

1540
01:56:29,113 --> 01:56:30,739
EVENING LIGHT

1541
01:56:32,199 --> 01:56:33,742
<i>Screen test one, Miss Grazia.</i>

1542
01:56:33,826 --> 01:56:35,661
<i>Bare your shoulders.</i>

1543
01:56:35,744 --> 01:56:39,248
<i>Saraghina, we've got the money.</i>

1544
01:56:39,790 --> 01:56:42,126
<i>Cut. Was that all right?</i>

1545
01:56:44,003 --> 01:56:46,839
Signora, what do you think?

1546
01:56:46,922 --> 01:56:49,258
Speak up. This is a democracy.

1547
01:56:49,341 --> 01:56:52,845
If he won't speak up, at least
you might say something. <i>Sacrebleu!</i>

1548
01:56:54,096 --> 01:56:57,892
You can't hide. We can find you anywhere.
How are you?

1549
01:56:57,975 --> 01:57:00,895
I'm Coletti, from Claudia's press agency.

1550
01:57:00,978 --> 01:57:04,398
We met 15 years ago. You remember me?

1551
01:57:04,481 --> 01:57:06,150
Look, she's here.

1552
01:57:06,233 --> 01:57:07,610
Where?

1553
01:57:13,449 --> 01:57:14,825
Excuse me.

1554
01:57:23,584 --> 01:57:24,668
Claudia.

1555
01:57:25,336 --> 01:57:27,296
- How are you?
- Fine. And you?

1556
01:57:28,547 --> 01:57:31,550
So you finally came.
Let's go outside, shall we?

1557
01:57:32,218 --> 01:57:34,261
This is Caroline, my secretary.

1558
01:57:36,847 --> 01:57:38,849
I'd like to speak to you alone.

1559
01:57:44,104 --> 01:57:47,066
- When do we start shooting?
- Very soon.

1560
01:57:47,149 --> 01:57:50,486
- What's my part?
- I'll tell you everything later.

1561
01:57:50,569 --> 01:57:52,404
I'm very happy to be working with you.

1562
01:57:52,488 --> 01:57:56,200
I hope I'll be of help.
But I want to know everything.

1563
01:57:57,284 --> 01:57:59,078
Where are we going now?

1564
01:58:08,337 --> 01:58:09,505
Well?

1565
01:58:11,507 --> 01:58:12,883
That way.

1566
01:58:28,941 --> 01:58:31,235
You're so beautiful. I'm tongue-tied.

1567
01:58:31,318 --> 01:58:33,612
You make my heart beat like a schoolboy's.

1568
01:58:34,863 --> 01:58:36,699
You don't believe me, do you?

1569
01:58:37,199 --> 01:58:39,868
You inspire true and deep respect.

1570
01:58:42,204 --> 01:58:44,623
Who do you love? Who do you care about?

1571
01:58:44,707 --> 01:58:45,874
You.

1572
01:58:49,169 --> 01:58:51,171
You've come just in time.

1573
01:58:52,298 --> 01:58:53,716
Why do you smile that way?

1574
01:58:53,799 --> 01:58:57,428
I never know if you're judging me,
forgiving me or mocking me.

1575
01:58:57,511 --> 01:58:58,512
I'm listening.

1576
01:58:58,595 --> 01:59:01,849
You said you'd tell me about the film.
I know nothing.

1577
01:59:08,147 --> 01:59:11,317
Could you leave everything behind
and start life all over again...

1578
01:59:13,235 --> 01:59:16,405
choose one thing only
and be faithful to it,

1579
01:59:16,488 --> 01:59:20,701
make it the reason for your existence,
the one thing that contains everything

1580
01:59:20,784 --> 01:59:22,953
because your dedication to it
makes it infinite?

1581
01:59:23,037 --> 01:59:24,413
Could you?

1582
01:59:26,332 --> 01:59:29,585
If I said to you, "Claudia"...

1583
01:59:32,254 --> 01:59:34,882
Which way are we going?
I don't know the way.

1584
01:59:35,674 --> 01:59:38,260
What about you? Could you?

1585
01:59:38,969 --> 01:59:42,681
The springs must be nearby.
Listen. Turn here.

1586
01:59:45,184 --> 01:59:47,811
No, this guy here couldn't do it.

1587
01:59:47,895 --> 01:59:50,022
He wants to grab everything and devour it.

1588
01:59:50,105 --> 01:59:52,107
He can't give up a single thing.

1589
01:59:52,191 --> 01:59:54,735
He changes direction every day
for fear of missing the path.

1590
01:59:54,818 --> 01:59:57,488
- He's slowly bleeding to death.
- Is this how the film ends?

1591
01:59:57,571 --> 01:59:58,864
No, this is how it starts.

1592
01:59:58,947 --> 02:00:01,033
Then he meets the girl at the springs,

1593
02:00:01,116 --> 02:00:03,535
one of those girls
who pass out the healing water.

1594
02:00:04,953 --> 02:00:06,163
She's beautiful...

1595
02:00:07,539 --> 02:00:09,083
both young and ancient,

1596
02:00:09,958 --> 02:00:12,878
a child and yet already a woman,
authentic and radiant.

1597
02:00:14,171 --> 02:00:16,965
There's no doubt that she's his salvation.

1598
02:00:17,758 --> 02:00:21,095
You'll be all in white,
your hair long, just as it is now.

1599
02:00:31,772 --> 02:00:33,065
Turn off the lights.

1600
02:01:11,937 --> 02:01:13,188
Now what?

1601
02:01:28,787 --> 02:01:30,414
Let's leave this place.

1602
02:01:32,124 --> 02:01:34,001
It makes me uneasy.

1603
02:01:34,084 --> 02:01:35,919
It doesn't seem real.

1604
02:01:36,003 --> 02:01:38,380
I really like it. Isn't that Odd?

1605
02:01:41,800 --> 02:01:45,345
I didn't understand much of your story.

1606
02:01:45,429 --> 02:01:49,600
A guy like your character,
who doesn't love anybody,

1607
02:01:49,683 --> 02:01:51,393
isn't very sympathetic, you know.

1608
02:01:53,395 --> 02:01:55,063
It's his fault.

1609
02:01:55,147 --> 02:01:57,316
What does he expect from other people?

1610
02:01:58,192 --> 02:02:00,486
You think I don't know that?

1611
02:02:01,278 --> 02:02:03,906
You're a pain like the others.

1612
02:02:03,989 --> 02:02:06,992
I see no one can tell you anything!

1613
02:02:07,075 --> 02:02:10,913
You're so funny in that big, ugly hat.
You look like an old man.

1614
02:02:13,624 --> 02:02:15,042
I don't understand.

1615
02:02:15,125 --> 02:02:20,255
He meets a new girl who can give him
new life, and he pushes her away?

1616
02:02:20,339 --> 02:02:22,341
Because he no longer believes in it.

1617
02:02:23,842 --> 02:02:25,761
Because he doesn't know how to love.

1618
02:02:25,844 --> 02:02:28,472
Because it's not true
that a woman can change a man.

1619
02:02:28,555 --> 02:02:29,995
Because he doesn't know how to love.

1620
02:02:30,057 --> 02:02:33,810
Above all, because I don't feel
like telling another pile of lies.

1621
02:02:33,894 --> 02:02:36,230
Because he doesn't know how to love.

1622
02:02:37,481 --> 02:02:40,359
I'm sorry for making you
come all the way here.

1623
02:02:40,442 --> 02:02:41,693
Forgive me.

1624
02:02:42,402 --> 02:02:44,613
You're such a phony.

1625
02:02:44,696 --> 02:02:46,698
So there's no part in the film.

1626
02:02:47,616 --> 02:02:50,911
You're right. There's no part.

1627
02:02:50,994 --> 02:02:53,038
And there's no film.

1628
02:02:53,121 --> 02:02:55,165
There's nothing anywhere.

1629
02:02:55,541 --> 02:02:58,919
And as far as I'm concerned,
it can all end right here.

1630
02:03:04,550 --> 02:03:07,302
Here they are!

1631
02:03:07,386 --> 02:03:10,222
Where did you go?
We're starting next week.

1632
02:03:10,305 --> 02:03:12,474
Your producer had a great idea.

1633
02:03:12,558 --> 02:03:16,436
The greatest cocktail party
to ever launch a movie.

1634
02:03:16,520 --> 02:03:18,647
The launchpad, tomorrow afternoon.

1635
02:03:18,730 --> 02:03:20,041
Radio, television, the foreign press.

1636
02:03:20,065 --> 02:03:22,067
Guido, we're starting for real.

1637
02:03:47,467 --> 02:03:48,844
Grab him!

1638
02:03:55,767 --> 02:03:57,519
Come on, walk!

1639
02:03:57,603 --> 02:03:59,354
I want to go home.

1640
02:03:59,438 --> 02:04:01,023
Come on!

1641
02:04:01,106 --> 02:04:02,899
Here he is!

1642
02:04:09,615 --> 02:04:12,326
Guido, where are you going?
It's over here!

1643
02:04:17,372 --> 02:04:20,334
Mr. Guido, I'm sure today
will be a beautiful...

1644
02:04:26,923 --> 02:04:30,552
I'm very curious
to finally hear the story.

1645
02:04:30,636 --> 02:04:34,264
Don't you take yourself
a bit too seriously, Mr. Anselmo?

1646
02:04:41,313 --> 02:04:44,024
Leave me alone! I can walk by myself!

1647
02:04:48,528 --> 02:04:51,323
Hello, and good luck!

1648
02:04:53,867 --> 02:04:55,702
<i>Commendatore</i>, here he is!

1649
02:04:59,164 --> 02:05:02,459
We've been waiting for you for three days.

1650
02:05:02,542 --> 02:05:05,170
- It's winter already.
- Attention, please.

1651
02:05:11,134 --> 02:05:13,804
Do you think pornography is an art form?

1652
02:05:13,887 --> 02:05:17,432
Is pornography
the most intense form of entertainment?

1653
02:05:19,059 --> 02:05:21,645
Why don't you ever make a film about love?

1654
02:05:33,907 --> 02:05:37,202
-I wish to announce that —
-Tomorrow, tomorrow.

1655
02:05:37,869 --> 02:05:39,371
What do you think you can teach us?

1656
02:05:39,454 --> 02:05:41,599
Do you really think your life
can be of interest to others?

1657
02:05:41,623 --> 02:05:44,751
Can you honestly admit
you have nothing to say?

1658
02:05:51,967 --> 02:05:55,846
He'll now speak to you directly.

1659
02:05:57,806 --> 02:05:59,057
Answer.

1660
02:05:59,141 --> 02:06:00,517
Go on.

1661
02:06:01,351 --> 02:06:03,228
Guido, say something.

1662
02:06:03,311 --> 02:06:06,314
Anything at all. Do it for me.

1663
02:06:09,109 --> 02:06:10,610
I promise you an art film!

1664
02:06:10,694 --> 02:06:14,364
If this film flops, what will you live on?

1665
02:06:14,448 --> 02:06:17,242
Are you for or against divorce?
Tell me honestly.

1666
02:06:22,789 --> 02:06:25,917
Your questions betray a certain hostility.

1667
02:06:26,001 --> 02:06:27,854
I assure you that my director
is in great form...

1668
02:06:27,878 --> 02:06:29,838
What am I supposed to do?

1669
02:06:29,921 --> 02:06:32,758
And should be treated with respect.

1670
02:06:32,841 --> 02:06:35,761
Conocchia, forgive me
if I treated you badly.

1671
02:06:35,844 --> 02:06:38,555
You were wonderful, the best of them all.

1672
02:06:38,638 --> 02:06:41,349
He ponders, considers, reflects.

1673
02:06:41,433 --> 02:06:42,517
Say something.

1674
02:06:42,601 --> 02:06:45,604
I've been paying for your confusion
and crises for months.

1675
02:06:45,687 --> 02:06:48,440
Quit this film and I'll ruin you.

1676
02:06:48,523 --> 02:06:51,443
He'll now be at your disposal.

1677
02:06:51,526 --> 02:06:53,445
Claudia, where are you?

1678
02:06:53,528 --> 02:06:55,614
Rossella, where are your spirits now?

1679
02:06:57,449 --> 02:06:59,701
What should I do? Leave you? Disappear?

1680
02:06:59,785 --> 02:07:02,454
You'll never be what you once were.

1681
02:07:02,537 --> 02:07:05,457
I'll no longer be your wife.
When will you truly marry me?

1682
02:07:05,540 --> 02:07:09,461
Luisa, do you really want a separation?

1683
02:07:09,544 --> 02:07:11,421
How can I go on like this till the end?

1684
02:07:11,505 --> 02:07:13,965
What does your wife think?

1685
02:07:18,220 --> 02:07:20,180
In your right-hand pocket.

1686
02:07:20,931 --> 02:07:22,307
So long, Guido.

1687
02:07:22,390 --> 02:07:24,559
I put it in your right-hand pocket.

1688
02:07:33,610 --> 02:07:36,571
No, nobody gets away with that!

1689
02:07:36,655 --> 02:07:38,240
Buffoon!

1690
02:07:38,323 --> 02:07:39,324
Lunatic!

1691
02:07:39,407 --> 02:07:41,868
Get out here, you coward!

1692
02:07:42,536 --> 02:07:45,747
Just a minute.
I'm thinking of what to say.

1693
02:07:45,831 --> 02:07:47,541
That's it!

1694
02:07:47,624 --> 02:07:49,876
I'm coming. I'm coming.

1695
02:07:52,295 --> 02:07:54,881
He's an incurable romantic.

1696
02:07:59,344 --> 02:08:01,972
Where are you running off to,
you naughty boy?

1697
02:08:19,990 --> 02:08:22,742
Take it all down, boys. This film is off.

1698
02:08:22,826 --> 02:08:26,121
It has to be gone in two days.
Start right away.

1699
02:08:26,204 --> 02:08:28,874
Get going. Tear it all down.
Right, <i>Dottore</i>?

1700
02:08:28,957 --> 02:08:31,585
Yes, thanks. So long, boys.

1701
02:08:31,668 --> 02:08:33,044
See you on another film.

1702
02:08:33,128 --> 02:08:34,671
Let's hope so.

1703
02:08:39,843 --> 02:08:41,428
So long, sailor.

1704
02:08:45,432 --> 02:08:46,808
You did the right thing.

1705
02:08:46,892 --> 02:08:49,352
Believe me, today is a good day for you.

1706
02:08:50,103 --> 02:08:52,647
These are tough decisions, I know.

1707
02:08:52,731 --> 02:08:56,651
But we intellectuals — and I say "we"
because I consider you one...

1708
02:08:56,735 --> 02:08:59,821
Must remain clear-headed right to the end.

1709
02:08:59,905 --> 02:09:02,782
There are so many superfluous things
in the world already.

1710
02:09:02,866 --> 02:09:04,951
No need to add chaos to chaos.

1711
02:09:06,703 --> 02:09:10,248
Besides, losing money
is part of a producer's job.

1712
02:09:11,708 --> 02:09:14,210
I congratulate you. You had no choice.

1713
02:09:14,294 --> 02:09:16,254
He got what he deserved

1714
02:09:16,338 --> 02:09:20,175
for embarking on such a frivolous venture
so lightheartedly.

1715
02:09:22,177 --> 02:09:24,596
No need for nostalgia or remorse.

1716
02:09:24,679 --> 02:09:26,097
Destroying is better than creating

1717
02:09:26,181 --> 02:09:28,516
when we're not creating
those few truly necessary things.

1718
02:09:29,476 --> 02:09:32,687
But is there anything
so just and true in this world

1719
02:09:32,771 --> 02:09:34,856
that it has the right to live?

1720
02:09:35,815 --> 02:09:38,777
For him, a bad film
is merely a financial matter,

1721
02:09:38,860 --> 02:09:42,030
but for you, at this point,
it could have been the end.

1722
02:09:43,073 --> 02:09:45,825
Better to knock it all down
and strew the ground with salt,

1723
02:09:45,909 --> 02:09:49,663
as the ancients did
to purify the battlefields.

1724
02:09:49,746 --> 02:09:51,915
In the end, what we need

1725
02:09:51,998 --> 02:09:55,627
is some hygiene,
cleanliness, disinfection.

1726
02:09:56,127 --> 02:10:00,632
We're smothered
by words, images and sounds

1727
02:10:00,715 --> 02:10:02,801
that have no right to exist,

1728
02:10:02,884 --> 02:10:06,054
that come from the void
and return to the void.

1729
02:10:06,137 --> 02:10:09,015
Of any artist truly deserving of the name,

1730
02:10:09,099 --> 02:10:12,185
we should ask nothing
but this act of faith...

1731
02:10:12,268 --> 02:10:14,229
To learn silence.

1732
02:10:14,312 --> 02:10:16,898
Remember Mallarme's homage
to the white page?

1733
02:10:16,982 --> 02:10:18,817
Guido, wait!

1734
02:10:21,236 --> 02:10:23,780
We're ready to begin. Hello, sir.

1735
02:10:26,783 --> 02:10:28,034
All my best wishes!

1736
02:10:28,118 --> 02:10:32,372
If we can't have everything,
nothingness is true perfection.

1737
02:10:32,455 --> 02:10:35,125
Forgive me
for making all these references,

1738
02:10:35,208 --> 02:10:38,003
but we critics do what we can.

1739
02:10:38,086 --> 02:10:42,716
Our true mission is to sweep away
the thousands of miscarriages

1740
02:10:42,799 --> 02:10:44,843
that try every day, obscenely,

1741
02:10:44,926 --> 02:10:46,594
to come into this world.

1742
02:10:47,429 --> 02:10:52,392
And you would actually leave behind you
a whole film,

1743
02:10:52,475 --> 02:10:56,104
like a cripple leaving behind
his crooked footprint.

1744
02:10:56,771 --> 02:11:00,650
What monstrous presumption
to think that others could benefit

1745
02:11:00,734 --> 02:11:03,737
from the squalid catalog of your mistakes.

1746
02:11:04,446 --> 02:11:06,948
What do you gain by stringing together

1747
02:11:07,032 --> 02:11:09,909
the tattered pieces of your life,
the vague memories,

1748
02:11:09,993 --> 02:11:13,705
the faces of those you could never love?

1749
02:11:22,380 --> 02:11:24,924
<i>What is this sudden happiness
that makes me tremble,</i>

1750
02:11:25,008 --> 02:11:27,594
<i>that gives me strength and life?</i>

1751
02:11:28,178 --> 02:11:30,138
<i>Forgive me, sweet creatures.</i>

1752
02:11:30,221 --> 02:11:32,474
<i>I didn't understand. I didn't know.</i>

1753
02:11:33,016 --> 02:11:35,894
<i>How right it is to accept you,
to love you.</i>

1754
02:11:35,977 --> 02:11:37,645
<i>And how simple.</i>

1755
02:11:38,146 --> 02:11:41,649
<i>Luisa, I feel like I've been set free.</i>

1756
02:11:41,733 --> 02:11:43,777
<i>Everything seems so good, so meaningful.</i>

1757
02:11:43,860 --> 02:11:45,320
<i>Everything is true.</i>

1758
02:11:45,403 --> 02:11:47,947
<i>I wish I could explain,</i>

1759
02:11:48,031 --> 02:11:49,908
<i>but I don't know how.</i>

1760
02:11:50,909 --> 02:11:55,663
<i>Now everything's all confused once again,
like it was before.</i>

1761
02:11:55,747 --> 02:11:58,291
<i>But this confusion is me,</i>

1762
02:11:58,374 --> 02:12:01,044
<i>as I am, not like I'd like to be.</i>

1763
02:12:01,127 --> 02:12:05,090
<i>I'm no longer afraid
of telling the truth —.</i>

1764
02:12:05,173 --> 02:12:08,593
<i>About what I don't know, what
I'm looking for, what I haven't found.</i>

1765
02:12:09,052 --> 02:12:10,804
<i>Only this way do I feel alive.</i>

1766
02:12:10,887 --> 02:12:13,890
<i>Only this way can I look
into your faithful eyes without shame.</i>

1767
02:12:14,349 --> 02:12:17,852
<i>Life is a celebration.
Let's live it together.</i>

1768
02:12:18,770 --> 02:12:21,564
<i>That's all I can say, Luisa,
to you and all the others.</i>

1769
02:12:21,648 --> 02:12:24,025
<i>Accept me for what I am, if you can.</i>

1770
02:12:24,109 --> 02:12:26,694
<i>It's the only way
we might find each other.</i>

1771
02:12:27,946 --> 02:12:30,698
I don't know if what you've said is right,

1772
02:12:30,782 --> 02:12:33,660
but I can try if you help me.

1773
02:12:51,094 --> 02:12:53,888
Welcome back. Follow me.

1774
02:13:33,344 --> 02:13:35,763
Just a minute. I'll give the signal.

1775
02:13:46,024 --> 02:13:47,442
There.

1776
02:13:47,525 --> 02:13:49,444
Now go to the curtain.

1777
02:13:58,661 --> 02:14:00,121
Open it.

1778
02:14:01,915 --> 02:14:03,875
Everyone come down.

1779
02:14:03,958 --> 02:14:06,586
Talk to each other.

1780
02:14:57,845 --> 02:14:59,264
Mama.

1781
02:15:04,352 --> 02:15:05,478
Sgulp!

1782
02:15:06,688 --> 02:15:09,691
I understand what you meant.
You can't do without us.

1783
02:15:10,525 --> 02:15:13,945
- What time will you call tomorrow?
- Fine, fine. Now join the line.

1784
02:15:14,445 --> 02:15:15,571
Maurice!

1785
02:15:19,617 --> 02:15:21,369
Come quickly! Stop fooling around.

1786
02:15:22,328 --> 02:15:25,415
Everybody hold hands!

1787
02:15:25,498 --> 02:15:26,791
Spread out!

1788
02:15:26,874 --> 02:15:29,002
All together!

1789
02:15:31,296 --> 02:15:32,588
Maestro!

1790
02:15:32,672 --> 02:15:34,966
Everyone hold hands!
