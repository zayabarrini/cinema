It was funny, huh?

14
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,557
Yes, but I have to pee.

15
00:02:19,766 --> 00:02:21,841
That'll teach you to excite yourself like this.

16
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:24,633
Stop somewhere if you can.

17
00:02:57,013 --> 00:02:59,586
Honey, you're not at school.
Don't bother poor Elly.

18
00:02:59,808 --> 00:03:02,595
It does not bother me.
I take her to the toilet.

19
00:03:05,897 --> 00:03:06,977
Shall I take this?

20
00:03:07,191 --> 00:03:09,148
- Didn't you tell the others?
- What?

21
00:03:09,442 --> 00:03:10,355
She was there.

22
00:03:10,569 --> 00:03:12,776
I didn't know it myself until last night.

23
00:03:13,154 --> 00:03:14,946
She doesn't even take too much room.

24
00:03:15,698 --> 00:03:17,360
- You okay?
- Yes, thank you.

25
00:03:17,784 --> 00:03:18,484
She's a nice woman.

26
00:03:18,702 --> 00:03:21,489
Wait one day.
and They'll all fall in love with her.

27
00:03:21,706 --> 00:03:22,820
Forget it, I'll do it.

28
00:03:23,081 --> 00:03:25,573
But no, I'm used to.

29
00:03:25,876 --> 00:03:26,789
Peyman!

30
00:03:28,087 --> 00:03:29,497
You drive too fast.

31
00:03:29,714 --> 00:03:31,790
- You drive too slow Amir!
- It's dangerous!

32
00:03:32,842 --> 00:03:33,956
Amir, is there something in the air?

33
00:03:34,176 --> 00:03:36,086
- What?
- That means you don't know?

34
00:03:36,304 --> 00:03:37,632
I swear, I don't know anything.

35
00:03:37,847 --> 00:03:40,635
Sepideh did not tell you
why she brought her?

36
00:03:40,851 --> 00:03:41,430
Not at all.

37
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:51,601
You must promise me not to say anything
when we are together.

38
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,359
Seriously, Ahmad,
it's a good girl.

39
00:03:54,573 --> 00:03:56,067
You really think so?

40
00:03:56,283 --> 00:03:57,564
She will turn your life upside down.

41
00:03:58,411 --> 00:03:59,821
You have seen this all in just 10 minutes?

42
00:04:00,997 --> 00:04:04,162
Sure. You can see it right away.
Not true, Naazy?

43
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:05,539
It is natural.

44
00:04:06,084 --> 00:04:07,876
Already three votes.

45
00:04:08,087 --> 00:04:10,660
I said she was kind
nothing more.

46
00:04:10,882 --> 00:04:14,583
Wait until tomorrow, none of you will dislike her.

47
00:04:14,803 --> 00:04:17,008
Don't you worry about it. Let them do what they like.

48
00:04:17,222 --> 00:04:20,507
If you find any other girl like this, keep her for me.

49
00:04:20,726 --> 00:04:23,180
Could someone slap his head for me please?

50
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:25,596
Manoochehr!

51
00:04:28,025 --> 00:04:29,519
Did you see this, Ahmad?

52
00:04:29,734 --> 00:04:30,647
Well done!

53
00:04:30,861 --> 00:04:32,319
You deserved it.

54
00:04:32,528 --> 00:04:34,569
Oh, really?

55
00:04:35,198 --> 00:04:38,153
Sepideh, does this girl know
that Ahmad was married before?

56
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:39,907
I don't know.

57
00:04:40,121 --> 00:04:41,698
And that she forced him to divorce her?

58
00:04:42,414 --> 00:04:44,573
Well laugh a little.

59
00:04:44,792 --> 00:04:45,741
Stop, Peyman!

60
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,038
What's her name again? Miss Elly!

61
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:50,122
-Miss Elly!
-Peyman ...

62
00:04:50,507 --> 00:04:51,123
Elly!

63
00:04:51,341 --> 00:04:52,585
Stop!

64
00:04:53,383 --> 00:04:55,009
You're going to embarrass her, stop!

65
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,219
Here is the charcoal samovar.

66
00:05:04,605 --> 00:05:07,771
Do you know how many years I haven't drunk
this kinda tea! Poor me!

67
00:05:07,982 --> 00:05:10,734
Ahmad, how did you do in
Germany?

68
00:05:10,944 --> 00:05:12,653
I lost my grip!

69
00:05:13,197 --> 00:05:15,522
That's why
your German wife left you.

70
00:05:16,408 --> 00:05:17,903
She told the judge:

71
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:20,411
"Achtung! Pachtung" This man is mad! "

72
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:21,570
Peyman!

73
00:05:22,206 --> 00:05:23,072
Am I lying?

74
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:25,584
Amir could you help me?

75
00:05:25,793 --> 00:05:26,623
I'm going.

76
00:05:31,216 --> 00:05:32,625
So what?

77
00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:34,502
It's not you that I called ...

78
00:05:35,971 --> 00:05:37,548
- Was there a problem?
- Not at all

79
00:05:37,764 --> 00:05:40,931
You know, they are teasing and kidding a lot.
Please don't get anything wrong.

80
00:05:41,268 --> 00:05:42,050
Is that all?

81
00:05:42,269 --> 00:05:46,646
Builds up the group.
Enjoy a few of these three days.

82
00:05:46,857 --> 00:05:48,399
- Three days?
- Of course!

83
00:06:19,349 --> 00:06:20,677
Madam ...

84
00:06:25,147 --> 00:06:27,139
You see I was right
for the address.

85
00:06:27,358 --> 00:06:29,813
For once it's me
that's wrong ...

86
00:06:30,027 --> 00:06:32,944
Good morning.
Could you hand me the key to the villa?

87
00:06:33,155 --> 00:06:36,738
- The Villa in the forest?
- The same as last year.

88
00:06:37,118 --> 00:06:37,817
Bahri?

89
00:06:38,035 --> 00:06:39,992
You were all together?

90
00:06:40,204 --> 00:06:42,031
Yes, in college.

91
00:06:42,248 --> 00:06:43,707
My sister Naazy.
Here Elly.

92
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:45,114
We already met.

93
00:06:45,334 --> 00:06:47,908
Really? Sure ...

94
00:06:48,129 --> 00:06:49,920
- Is it here?
- No, the key is here.

95
00:06:50,798 --> 00:06:52,756
Accompany them to the villa.

96
00:06:52,968 --> 00:06:56,383
We know the path.
We just need the key.

97
00:06:56,597 --> 00:06:57,925
How are you?

98
00:06:58,515 --> 00:07:00,176
Very well, thank you.

99
00:07:00,392 --> 00:07:02,681
Don't forget about tomorrow evening.

100
00:07:02,979 --> 00:07:04,722
- What?
- To leave earlier.

101
00:07:04,938 --> 00:07:06,480
Because the owner arrives in the afternoon
from Tehran.

102
00:07:07,149 --> 00:07:09,521
so you have to leave in the evening.

103
00:07:09,735 --> 00:07:11,230
But we want to stay three days.

104
00:07:11,445 --> 00:07:12,940
I already told one of on the phone.

105
00:07:13,155 --> 00:07:14,530
It was me.

106
00:07:14,824 --> 00:07:16,022
So we can't do anything about it?

107
00:07:16,242 --> 00:07:18,199
For us, it wouldn't be a problem.

108
00:07:18,412 --> 00:07:19,786
But it is the owner.

109
00:07:19,995 --> 00:07:21,739
He did not know
we wanted to stay for 3 days?

110
00:07:21,956 --> 00:07:24,032
We already told you on the phone.

111
00:07:25,418 --> 00:07:27,161
I thought you had all provided for!

112
00:07:27,462 --> 00:07:31,673
Everything was full. I took it
thinking that we could find something else.

113
00:07:31,883 --> 00:07:34,802
Something else?
At this time of year? That's impossible.

114
00:07:35,011 --> 00:07:36,505
I'm sorry.

115
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:38,002
It's not your fault madam.

116
00:07:38,223 --> 00:07:40,014
Why didn't you tell me?

117
00:07:40,225 --> 00:07:42,846
If I said it, we weren't here now.

118
00:07:46,774 --> 00:07:47,936
It's okay.

119
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:50,274
We will find some other place.

120
00:07:50,778 --> 00:07:54,194
At the phone, you didn't tell me that there is no chance.

121
00:07:54,406 --> 00:07:55,188
But if ...

122
00:07:55,407 --> 00:07:56,819
Can't you do anything?

123
00:07:57,034 --> 00:07:58,232
But what?

124
00:07:58,452 --> 00:08:01,904
If it was just us, we would find
some place to camped.

125
00:08:02,124 --> 00:08:06,167
But we have guests with us,
a pair of newlyweds.

126
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:07,749
May God bless.

127
00:08:07,962 --> 00:08:12,090
The groom is from Germany.
It's something like a honeymoon.

128
00:08:12,301 --> 00:08:13,842
What about the villa of Mr.Mahmoudi?

129
00:08:14,053 --> 00:08:15,332
That is taken.

130
00:08:15,553 --> 00:08:17,096
We would go anywhere.

131
00:08:17,305 --> 00:08:19,595
- And the one at the beach?
- That of Sadeghian?

132
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,935
- It dons' have any good windows or doors.
- you will be very cold at night.

133
00:08:23,146 --> 00:08:23,927
And it is dirty.

134
00:08:24,147 --> 00:08:25,855
We could clean it. Can we see the place?

135
00:08:26,065 --> 00:08:27,345
Go get the key from your uncle.

136
00:08:27,566 --> 00:08:29,143
Thank you very much.

137
00:08:48,171 --> 00:08:49,630
What a beautiful sea!

138
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,382
What else, my mother?

139
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:53,790
Arash.

140
00:09:03,271 --> 00:09:05,940
Are you sure it's the right key?

141
00:09:06,648 --> 00:09:10,017
Attention don't hurt yourself.
Here we go!

142
00:09:10,235 --> 00:09:12,609
Okay, Ahmad! It's open.

143
00:09:13,365 --> 00:09:14,906
How did you get in, you?

144
00:09:17,493 --> 00:09:19,153
Be careful not to fall.

145
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:43,311
How filthy!

146
00:09:50,235 --> 00:09:51,517
Be Careful!

147
00:09:54,657 --> 00:09:57,231
Wow it's so huge.

148
00:09:58,494 --> 00:10:01,116
Be careful there's glass on the floor.

149
00:10:05,586 --> 00:10:07,377
The air conditioning works.

150
00:10:11,299 --> 00:10:12,878
Where are the toilets?

151
00:10:15,471 --> 00:10:17,842
It has no locks. Will you watch?

152
00:10:20,267 --> 00:10:23,055
If you use the toilet,
they won't take it back!

153
00:10:25,273 --> 00:10:26,553
Very funny ...

154
00:10:29,777 --> 00:10:32,944
We will spend our time
to do the housework. Careful!

155
00:10:33,155 --> 00:10:33,903
Do not worry!

156
00:10:36,493 --> 00:10:39,162
Hey little boy, are there gas containers here?

157
00:10:39,371 --> 00:10:42,574
- With a vacuum cleaner, This would go faster.
- You go sit down.

158
00:10:44,793 --> 00:10:46,667
Peyman, It will be cold at night.

159
00:10:46,877 --> 00:10:49,251
Just cover the windows with something.

160
00:10:49,465 --> 00:10:51,256
Wait, you're not alone.

161
00:10:52,092 --> 00:10:54,844
I can make a suggestion?

162
00:10:55,471 --> 00:10:57,877
- Tonight ...
- But it is good here!

163
00:10:58,099 --> 00:10:59,972
Just let me say something?

164
00:11:01,602 --> 00:11:03,144
Go ..

165
00:11:03,646 --> 00:11:07,014
We go into the other house tonight
and come back here tomorrow.

166
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:09,938
We have to moved again then tomorrow!

167
00:11:14,323 --> 00:11:16,649
The toilets are not intimate
but they work!

168
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,818
This is crucial!

169
00:11:21,122 --> 00:11:22,783
It's beautiful here.

170
00:11:22,999 --> 00:11:23,995
Beautiful.

171
00:11:26,753 --> 00:11:29,291
We can't spend
three days just thinking what to do!

172
00:11:29,673 --> 00:11:31,880
- Now what?
- We vote.

173
00:11:32,968 --> 00:11:34,462
Elly, what do you say?

174
00:11:34,678 --> 00:11:36,089
I take care of the cleaning.

175
00:11:36,305 --> 00:11:37,930
And you, Shohreh?

176
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:41,510
I propose
we go look elsewhere.

177
00:11:41,727 --> 00:11:43,886
A vote against.
And you, Naazy?

178
00:11:44,105 --> 00:11:45,302
I am the voice of my master.

179
00:11:46,107 --> 00:11:46,937
Then her master?

180
00:11:47,191 --> 00:11:48,223
We should stay.

181
00:11:48,943 --> 00:11:49,939
And you, Peyman?

182
00:11:50,153 --> 00:11:52,395
I say no,
as my master.

183
00:11:52,613 --> 00:11:53,645
You're stupid!

184
00:11:54,449 --> 00:11:55,279
Two votes against.

185
00:11:55,492 --> 00:11:57,698
Two against five, we stay!

186
00:11:57,911 --> 00:11:59,619
And me, my vote
nobody cares ...

187
00:12:00,038 --> 00:12:02,327
Oh my!

188
00:12:21,227 --> 00:12:23,932
- Where are you going?
- I get a broom.

189
00:12:33,531 --> 00:12:35,025
Fetch the luggage?

190
00:12:35,241 --> 00:12:37,199
Lets clean up first.

191
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:39,320
Once we start it will take a while.

192
00:12:39,746 --> 00:12:40,825
Sepideh?

193
00:12:41,581 --> 00:12:42,696
Do you have the keys?

194
00:12:58,474 --> 00:13:00,930
- Hey boy what is your name?
- Omid.

195
00:13:01,352 --> 00:13:03,641
Omid, are there any shops
around here?

196
00:13:03,855 --> 00:13:05,931
- What do you need Ahmad?
- Cigarettes.

197
00:13:11,195 --> 00:13:12,394
I'll handle this.

198
00:13:12,614 --> 00:13:15,187
Thank you.
Put it down, I'll take it.

199
00:13:15,492 --> 00:13:16,191
Arash!

200
00:13:16,409 --> 00:13:18,568
Come in, darling. You're soaked!

201
00:13:18,787 --> 00:13:20,910
Peyman, call your son.

202
00:13:23,667 --> 00:13:25,707
I will spend the whole weekend
looking after him.

203
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:27,876
Relax! We came
with the whole band.

204
00:13:28,088 --> 00:13:31,957
I can't expect from everyone
not to go  to the sea because of our son.

205
00:13:32,468 --> 00:13:35,219
Come, my darling.

206
00:13:36,096 --> 00:13:38,634
Peyman, look if you find
the water heater.

207
00:13:38,849 --> 00:13:40,131
Isn't it inside?

208
00:13:40,935 --> 00:13:42,678
-No
-Then we have a problem

209
00:13:47,443 --> 00:13:48,687
Cutie!

210
00:14:02,124 --> 00:14:04,117
Yes? What's up?

211
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:23,593
So?

212
00:14:24,271 --> 00:14:24,937
Sorry

213
00:14:25,273 --> 00:14:26,851
- You scared me.
- Sorry!

214
00:14:27,651 --> 00:14:28,682
I'll throw it away.

215
00:14:30,111 --> 00:14:32,898
- Does it fit through?
- Yes, I think so.

216
00:14:34,033 --> 00:14:35,906
Up.

217
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:39,411
- It doesn't fit. Wait.
- No, it's locked.

218
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,152
Give me that.

219
00:14:41,374 --> 00:14:43,579
No it doesn't work!

220
00:14:43,792 --> 00:14:45,535
Bend it a little.

221
00:14:49,047 --> 00:14:50,839
You see, it worked!

222
00:14:51,717 --> 00:14:52,962
I come and help.

223
00:14:54,971 --> 00:14:56,763
Wait, you'll cut yourself!

224
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:01,260
Be careful not to cut yourself.

225
00:15:03,355 --> 00:15:05,229
I'm here, Morvarid.

226
00:15:09,903 --> 00:15:11,100
Sepideh!

227
00:15:12,071 --> 00:15:13,235
Who sleeps where?

228
00:15:13,449 --> 00:15:15,940
Who cares. We do as we can.

229
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,409
Women in the rooms,
and husbands in the living-room.

230
00:15:19,622 --> 00:15:21,198
I am not separating from my wife.

231
00:15:21,415 --> 00:15:22,790
Then you both in the living room.

232
00:15:22,999 --> 00:15:25,159
- Shohreh?
- Yes?

233
00:15:25,627 --> 00:15:26,374
I'm coming.

234
00:15:27,046 --> 00:15:29,334
We will spend a hell of a night!

235
00:15:29,549 --> 00:15:31,125
We'll dance to keep warm.

236
00:15:31,676 --> 00:15:33,254
And those who can not dance?

237
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:34,797
We'll teach you.

238
00:16:21,895 --> 00:16:23,473
Go get her!

239
00:16:24,356 --> 00:16:26,064
- What?
- Go ahead., Run!

240
00:16:27,025 --> 00:16:29,515
Don't let the opportunity pass!

241
00:16:29,736 --> 00:16:31,859
It won't look good!

242
00:16:44,835 --> 00:16:47,623
Ok leave me. I'll go.

243
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:19,575
Arash!

244
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,456
Get out of the water, quick!

245
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:24,533
Go see in the kitchen.

246
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:27,290
Well, Ahmad, your smokes.

247
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,750
Come back here! Hurry!

248
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:31,294
Go get him.

249
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,591
I said come here, you rogue!

250
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,216
You're all wet!

251
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:43,468
Look at that!

252
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:44,933
Elly!

253
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:48,984
- Looking for the lady?
- Yes.

254
00:17:49,278 --> 00:17:50,736
She went to phone.

255
00:17:50,946 --> 00:17:52,737
There 's no mobile phone connection here.

256
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:56,944
Stop screaming.
Hurry.

257
00:17:57,578 --> 00:18:00,781
You have to go buy light bulbs.

258
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:07,995
Ahmad, listen!
Elly went to phone.

259
00:18:08,214 --> 00:18:10,456
Take her for a ride.

260
00:18:10,675 --> 00:18:12,550
Leave her a little peace.

261
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,171
There is still no hot water.

262
00:18:14,388 --> 00:18:16,510
I put the water heater on. It's coming.

263
00:18:16,723 --> 00:18:18,134
The 3 Days will pass soon

264
00:18:18,349 --> 00:18:19,215
and you didn't do a thing.

265
00:18:23,188 --> 00:18:24,137
What are you looking for?

266
00:18:24,356 --> 00:18:26,147
Ahmad goes shopping.

267
00:18:26,358 --> 00:18:28,481
I told him
to fuel the car.

268
00:18:29,653 --> 00:18:31,195
Here, the keys.

269
00:18:32,823 --> 00:18:37,651
I come back tomorrow.
I'll be there around midnight.

270
00:18:39,163 --> 00:18:41,156
By bus, yes.

271
00:18:41,792 --> 00:18:44,282
Do not worry.
I will be with a colleague.

272
00:18:46,587 --> 00:18:47,832
She's fine.

273
00:18:48,047 --> 00:18:52,211
Mom, if someone calls,
don't say that I left town.

274
00:18:52,927 --> 00:18:55,384
Say you don't know where I am.

275
00:18:55,597 --> 00:18:57,636
Do you still have any pain?

276
00:18:58,391 --> 00:18:59,934
Love.

277
00:19:01,436 --> 00:19:05,601
Yes, I am careful.
We're all colleagues, I say.

278
00:19:05,899 --> 00:19:07,014
Okay.

279
00:19:07,567 --> 00:19:10,687
I'll call you.
There 's no connection here.

280
00:19:11,154 --> 00:19:12,946
We talk later.

281
00:19:13,825 --> 00:19:16,196
Love. Goodbye.

282
00:19:17,077 --> 00:19:18,241
Could  you call?

283
00:19:18,537 --> 00:19:19,997
Yes, thank you.

284
00:19:20,748 --> 00:19:21,744
Was she worried?

285
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:26,335
My mom is always worried.
She just had a heart surgery.

286
00:19:26,547 --> 00:19:27,921
Recently?

287
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:32,959
A month ago. The doctor
told her to avoid stress.

288
00:19:33,177 --> 00:19:35,882
If I had called 1 hour later,
she probably would have had a heart attack!

289
00:19:39,517 --> 00:19:43,349
"Hi, Mom.
Yes, I'm fine and you?

290
00:19:43,563 --> 00:19:45,889
"Of course I eat ..."

291
00:19:46,108 --> 00:19:49,642
She thought I was dying of hunger in
Germany.

292
00:19:49,861 --> 00:19:52,317
Once at the airport,
they opened my suitcase.

293
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:55,065
A jar of pickles
broke!

294
00:19:55,284 --> 00:19:58,071
It reeked of vinegar!
I was ashamed of my life!

295
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,951
She must be happy
that you came back.

296
00:20:02,793 --> 00:20:04,416
She died two years ago.

297
00:20:05,336 --> 00:20:06,535
I'm Sorry.

298
00:20:07,255 --> 00:20:10,540
When I was in the midst of a divorce.

299
00:20:11,801 --> 00:20:13,509
She has suffered, poor one.

300
00:20:17,932 --> 00:20:19,806
I can ask a delicate question?

301
00:20:22,229 --> 00:20:24,139
Is it about my honor?

302
00:20:24,899 --> 00:20:25,563
No.

303
00:20:26,818 --> 00:20:27,766
Go ..

304
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,234
Why did you separate?

305
00:20:34,283 --> 00:20:35,278
From which one?

306
00:20:37,077 --> 00:20:38,904
You are not obliged to answer me.

307
00:20:39,331 --> 00:20:40,872
Why are you Interested?

308
00:20:43,293 --> 00:20:45,867
I do not know.
To find out, anyway ...

309
00:20:46,672 --> 00:20:48,129
To find out anyway ...

310
00:20:49,591 --> 00:20:53,210
One morning we woke up,
we took our shower,

311
00:20:53,803 --> 00:20:56,924
and at breakfast, she said:
"Ahmad,

312
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:02,559
"Besser ein Ende mit Schrecken ...

313
00:21:03,772 --> 00:21:05,812
"..als ein Schrecken ohne Ende."

314
00:21:08,861 --> 00:21:09,775
What?

315
00:21:10,153 --> 00:21:11,102
Go ahead. Repeat.

316
00:21:11,322 --> 00:21:12,947
- What?
- Besser ...

317
00:21:14,616 --> 00:21:16,610
ein Ende mit Schrecken ...

318
00:21:19,288 --> 00:21:21,246
I can not, sorry!

319
00:21:22,209 --> 00:21:23,785
You want me to stop?

320
00:21:24,836 --> 00:21:27,291
No, I know who it is.
I call back later.

321
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:30,550
So what does it mean?

322
00:21:31,343 --> 00:21:34,758
A bitter end is much better than
a bitterness without ending.

323
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:40,340
It's true.

324
00:21:43,606 --> 00:21:44,934
A little music.

325
00:22:09,633 --> 00:22:11,875
- You're so late.
- A little, yes.

326
00:22:12,803 --> 00:22:14,297
Did you have fun, Ahmad?

327
00:22:14,513 --> 00:22:15,426
Good morning.

328
00:22:16,974 --> 00:22:21,303
Arash, help bring these inside, little man?

329
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,478
At night it's cold.

330
00:22:26,234 --> 00:22:28,226
Here is the bed for the newlyweds.

331
00:22:28,443 --> 00:22:29,903
We are all newlyweds!

332
00:22:30,113 --> 00:22:31,904
But the all-new

333
00:22:32,155 --> 00:22:33,699
lovebirds ...

334
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:36,573
Where are they? Show them to me.

335
00:22:38,163 --> 00:22:42,457
Congratulations!
I wish you happiness!

336
00:22:51,009 --> 00:22:52,124
What are you doing?

337
00:22:57,308 --> 00:22:58,470
You have dinner with us?

338
00:22:58,684 --> 00:23:02,302
No thank you.
Just keep the doors locked.

339
00:23:02,521 --> 00:23:06,519
And your cars
are not protected here.

340
00:23:06,984 --> 00:23:08,182
Dinner is served.

341
00:23:11,864 --> 00:23:14,818
Go. I shut the door.

342
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:21,455
Eat well, Ahmad.
You will not get this food in Germany.

343
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:23,161
Especially not for free!

344
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:25,876
Children, come!

345
00:23:26,088 --> 00:23:28,709
Why are you standing. Go sit down.

346
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:30,466
Come on, Elly.

347
00:23:30,676 --> 00:23:31,956
Ahmad, make a little room.

348
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:34,804
- It's ok here.
- Go ahead dear.

349
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:37,006
Ahmad is going to be sad.

350
00:23:37,266 --> 00:23:38,808
Manoochehr!

351
00:23:40,562 --> 00:23:41,889
Push yourself a little.

352
00:23:46,651 --> 00:23:48,643
Does anyone need anything?

353
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:50,776
I'm coming.

354
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:53,568
- I get you some salad?
- I will do it, thank you.

355
00:23:53,783 --> 00:23:56,274
- You are shy.
- No, I am ok.

356
00:23:58,538 --> 00:23:59,403
Here.

357
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:03,204
Are you crazy?

358
00:24:04,836 --> 00:24:07,162
Don't use it all. It's for the toilet.

359
00:24:08,298 --> 00:24:09,674
Eh, Amir!

360
00:24:09,883 --> 00:24:11,046
- The toilet?
- We're at the table!

361
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,291
And the salt?

362
00:24:12,803 --> 00:24:14,214
It's in the kitchen.

363
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:15,295
Manoochehr, c'mon.

364
00:24:15,764 --> 00:24:17,046
I forgot the salt?

365
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:22,976
You've washed your hands, my cowboy?

366
00:24:27,234 --> 00:24:28,266
Please take some.

367
00:24:32,073 --> 00:24:33,567
Congratulations.

368
00:24:38,621 --> 00:24:40,745
Long live the newlyweds

369
00:24:52,886 --> 00:24:53,917
Eat, it cools.

370
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:10,192
Elly, dear did you find it?

371
00:25:20,165 --> 00:25:21,826
Thank you, how nice.

372
00:25:22,334 --> 00:25:23,663
Who wants salt?

373
00:25:25,795 --> 00:25:28,713
Enough.
Put this on hold.

374
00:25:29,884 --> 00:25:33,299
Why are you guys out here alone?

375
00:25:33,513 --> 00:25:36,430
Ahmad, what are you doing here?
Stand up!

376
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,175
Why?

377
00:25:37,392 --> 00:25:39,219
- How did it go?
- What?

378
00:25:39,435 --> 00:25:40,930
When you were out.

379
00:25:41,146 --> 00:25:44,229
He is already stiff crazy about her.

380
00:25:45,442 --> 00:25:47,813
I'm in love

381
00:25:48,027 --> 00:25:51,728
Passionately in love

382
00:25:51,949 --> 00:25:53,573
Stop it. Seriously.

383
00:25:54,951 --> 00:25:58,699
At the end of the weekend, we will vote.
If the majority says yes,

384
00:25:58,913 --> 00:26:00,705
I'll ask for her hand.
If not, no.

385
00:26:00,916 --> 00:26:01,996
The majority, is them?

386
00:26:02,208 --> 00:26:04,498
We, we all agree.

387
00:26:04,712 --> 00:26:06,086
And you, Amir?

388
00:26:06,589 --> 00:26:09,341
- It's not my business.
- Give your opinion.

389
00:26:09,883 --> 00:26:11,793
- She is a nice girl.
- Is that all?

390
00:26:12,344 --> 00:26:13,804
Yeah.

391
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:16,632
She is warm, quiet.
I like her.

392
00:26:16,849 --> 00:26:18,344
- Really?
- Yes.

393
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,721
Seriously?

394
00:26:22,313 --> 00:26:24,140
She seems uncomplicated.

395
00:26:24,691 --> 00:26:25,687
And you, Manoochehr?

396
00:26:26,818 --> 00:26:28,062
She is nice.

397
00:26:28,986 --> 00:26:30,482
-Can I say?
- Ok

398
00:26:31,739 --> 00:26:32,985
You laugh at me.

399
00:26:36,285 --> 00:26:37,151
She is great.

400
00:26:37,371 --> 00:26:39,162
- Really?
- I swear.

401
00:26:39,582 --> 00:26:41,573
I'm going, you can talk now.

402
00:26:42,417 --> 00:26:45,122
Can you bring us
two teas please?

403
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:46,832
Come join your families instead!

404
00:26:47,047 --> 00:26:48,542
No, don't touch it!

405
00:26:48,758 --> 00:26:50,002
Fire! Fire!

406
00:26:52,929 --> 00:26:54,387
What did you do to us?

407
00:26:56,558 --> 00:26:57,803
Stop exploiting my girlfriend.

408
00:26:58,016 --> 00:26:59,974
It's your girlfriend she won't stop.

409
00:27:00,186 --> 00:27:02,013
We like you even if you do nothing.

410
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:04,768
- Give this it to me.
- I wanted to make some tea ...

411
00:27:05,066 --> 00:27:06,062
I leave it there.

412
00:27:06,275 --> 00:27:09,526
Come on, girls.
We'll do that tomorrow.

413
00:27:09,862 --> 00:27:12,152
- Come, let's sit.
- We will.

414
00:27:14,993 --> 00:27:17,485
- How do you find her?
- She is nice.

415
00:27:17,705 --> 00:27:19,662
A little too reserved, no?

416
00:27:19,873 --> 00:27:21,332
She is embarrassed, poor one.

417
00:27:23,336 --> 00:27:24,830
Four words.

418
00:27:27,548 --> 00:27:28,544

00:28:07,632 --> 00:28:09,255

434
00:28:17,183 --> 00:28:18,215
Mother?

435
00:28:18,852 --> 00:28:20,595
The mother of the honey bee!

436
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,271
Two words?

437
00:28:28,487 --> 00:28:29,945
Is it two words, my honey?

438
00:28:31,949 --> 00:28:33,988
Mother?
Child?

439
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:35,818

Fifth word.

459
00:29:41,563 --> 00:29:43,555
Summer? Heat?

460
00:29:43,773 --> 00:29:46,859
Is it hot? Fire?

461
00:29:47,194 --> 00:29:48,392

I go inside, folks.

466
00:30:29,112 --> 00:30:30,310
- Why?
- I have to care of something.

467
00:30:30,531 --> 00:30:32,322
We were about to crush them.

468
00:30:36,286 --> 00:30:37,567
Here we go!

469
00:31:03,648 --> 00:31:04,431
Elly!

470
00:31:07,527 --> 00:31:09,520
We go shopping.
Do you need anything?

471
00:31:09,739 --> 00:31:10,818
Two minutes, I come too.

472
00:31:11,031 --> 00:31:13,736
- Tell me what you need.
- Ineed to get my ticket.

473
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:15,822
In your dreams!

474
00:31:16,036 --> 00:31:16,783
Shohreh ...

475
00:31:18,164 --> 00:31:19,622
Sepideh ...

476
00:31:20,624 --> 00:31:21,704
Wait ...

477
00:31:23,587 --> 00:31:24,618
Arash.

478
00:31:26,088 --> 00:31:27,630
No, it's impossible

479
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,339
- Close the door.
- There is nobody, come on.

480
00:31:35,432 --> 00:31:36,926
I really have to go back this afternoon.

481
00:31:37,142 --> 00:31:38,091
No, it's impossible

482
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:40,266
Don't you like it here Elly?

483
00:31:40,478 --> 00:31:42,138
No, Naazy, it was expected.

484
00:31:42,355 --> 00:31:44,563
I said
I would stay just one night.

485
00:31:44,774 --> 00:31:46,270
The guys should clean up.

486
00:31:46,485 --> 00:31:48,146
Arash, you stay beside the water.

487
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,102
What an outfit.

488
00:31:50,322 --> 00:31:52,648
What a short journey for you then.

489
00:31:52,867 --> 00:31:56,069
You won't find a bus.
You'll have to walk home.

490
00:31:56,371 --> 00:31:57,995
- Then I will.
- By foot?

491
00:31:59,124 --> 00:32:00,403
Come on, lady!

492
00:32:01,291 --> 00:32:03,748
My mom is going to argue, my dear.

493
00:32:03,961 --> 00:32:05,337
You come, Shohreh?

494
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:07,088
Sepideh ...

495
00:32:10,218 --> 00:32:11,962
I would stay if I could.

496
00:32:12,178 --> 00:32:14,504
- You must stay.
- My mother will be worried.

497
00:32:14,931 --> 00:32:18,052
- Naazy, you watch the children?
- Yes.

498
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,890
I tell her
that you have been kept by force.

499
00:32:21,604 --> 00:32:25,056
If it's like that
I'll grab a taxi by the side of the road.

500
00:32:25,275 --> 00:32:26,983
I really have to leave.

501
00:32:27,194 --> 00:32:30,527
If she wants to leave
don't force her, Sepideh.

502
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,110
I wish I could stay.
Sepideh knows why.

503
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:37,455
We came together.
And we leave together.

504
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:40,824
- 'Till later

505
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:52,753
Amir ... keys!

506
00:32:54,598 --> 00:32:56,056
Amir, where are the keys?

507
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:57,725
On the terrace, with my mobile phone.

508
00:33:03,983 --> 00:33:05,357
Give it, be nice...

509
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:06,816
Be nice ...

510
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,876
Arash, darling ...

511
00:33:31,094 --> 00:33:32,423
- Don't go further away.
- Okay.

512
00:33:32,637 --> 00:33:35,804
Play a little and go inside.

513
00:33:42,647 --> 00:33:46,017
Naazy, watch him, please.

514
00:33:46,317 --> 00:33:48,027
Don't forget the onions.

515
00:33:52,033 --> 00:33:53,444
What did she say?

516
00:33:53,658 --> 00:33:55,699
To buy onions.

517
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,060
Relax,
we'll make a good soup tonight.

518
00:34:22,439 --> 00:34:23,898
Nice ring.

519
00:34:24,108 --> 00:34:24,808
Thank you.

520
00:34:25,025 --> 00:34:28,442
Elly dear, please watch the children?
I'll clean up a little.

521
00:34:41,584 --> 00:34:43,043
What's up?

522
00:34:43,712 --> 00:34:45,170
Please fix it for me.

523
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:46,578
Ok.

524
00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:43,387
Come hold it.

525
00:35:44,441 --> 00:35:45,640
I have to go now.

526
00:36:08,341 --> 00:36:09,587
Daddy!

527
00:36:21,021 --> 00:36:22,480
Yes, darling?

528
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,767
Daddy! Arash!

529
00:36:25,944 --> 00:36:28,268
Come here.
Let Arash alone.

530
00:36:28,613 --> 00:36:29,645
Arash ...

531
00:36:30,449 --> 00:36:32,524
Itake care of your dad, here!

532
00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:36,241
Daddy! Daddy!

533
00:36:37,664 --> 00:36:39,372
- Dad, Arash!
- Morvarid?

534
00:36:39,792 --> 00:36:42,792
Arash is in the water!

535
00:36:48,174 --> 00:36:49,289
Arash!

536
00:37:02,022 --> 00:37:03,268
Where is Arash?

537
00:37:03,483 --> 00:37:04,230
There!

538
00:37:04,442 --> 00:37:05,107
My God!

539
00:37:05,318 --> 00:37:07,856
He was in the water?
Who watched you?

540
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,060
Go see
if he is inside!

541
00:37:11,575 --> 00:37:13,068
Arash!

542
00:37:13,285 --> 00:37:13,865
Is he here?

543
00:37:16,454 --> 00:37:17,319
He is in the water!

544
00:37:22,794 --> 00:37:23,825
Amir!

545
00:37:28,425 --> 00:37:29,421
His shoes!

546
00:37:32,764 --> 00:37:33,877
Manoochehr!

547
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,551
Manoochehr!

548
00:38:02,837 --> 00:38:04,912
Ahmad! Ahmad!

549
00:38:05,172 --> 00:38:06,204
Ahmad!

550
00:38:13,765 --> 00:38:15,722
On the other side!

551
00:38:15,932 --> 00:38:16,964
To your left!

552
00:38:17,893 --> 00:38:19,803
He is there, Ahmad!

553
00:38:35,953 --> 00:38:36,654
He is here!

554
00:39:11,992 --> 00:39:14,993
Look it breathes.

555
00:39:16,288 --> 00:39:18,197
Look if he breathes!

556
00:39:47,737 --> 00:39:48,935
Put him there.

557
00:39:52,117 --> 00:39:54,240
On the side,
to empty the lungs.

558
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,496
Raise his head.

559
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:09,592
Wake up, my son!

560
00:40:10,011 --> 00:40:10,924
Arash!

561
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:36,861
You've left the Children like that?
Where were their mothers?

562
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,623
Elly was with them.

563
00:41:01,481 --> 00:41:02,512
Ahmad!

564
00:41:07,612 --> 00:41:08,810
Elly!

565
00:41:10,282 --> 00:41:12,358
- Was she in the water?
-Morvarid was playing, she didn't see her.

566
00:41:13,618 --> 00:41:15,777
Morvarid!
Where was Elly?

567
00:41:15,663 --> 00:41:16,742
- Inside?
- No.

568
00:41:16,955 --> 00:41:18,782
And if she was with Arash?

569
00:41:24,129 --> 00:41:24,911
Elly!

570
00:41:26,633 --> 00:41:28,091
What happened?

571
00:41:30,803 --> 00:41:32,049
Naazy?

572
00:41:33,097 --> 00:41:34,128
What ...

573
00:41:39,145 --> 00:41:40,261
Arash!

574
00:41:41,731 --> 00:41:43,523
Was Elly in the water with you?

575
00:41:43,733 --> 00:41:44,765
Why?

576
00:41:44,984 --> 00:41:47,524
- Hey, was she in the water, too?
- She dissappeared!

577
00:42:02,128 --> 00:42:04,500
Young man, help!

578
00:42:04,965 --> 00:42:07,419
Run! Go ahead. "

579
00:42:13,472 --> 00:42:14,468
What a catastrophe!

580
00:42:17,185 --> 00:42:17,849
Peyman?

581
00:42:23,316 --> 00:42:24,183
Arash?

582
00:42:33,202 --> 00:42:34,826
Don't be afraid.
It's Elly.

583
00:42:35,163 --> 00:42:36,158
Oh no!

584
00:42:36,873 --> 00:42:38,200
She wanted to save Arash ...

585
00:42:38,415 --> 00:42:39,412
Where is my son?

586
00:42:39,626 --> 00:42:40,539
Inside.

587
00:42:42,086 --> 00:42:43,118
Sepideh!

588
00:42:43,921 --> 00:42:45,380
Please help!

589
00:42:47,508 --> 00:42:49,002
Who is in the water?

590
00:42:49,218 --> 00:42:50,297
Elly!

591
00:42:51,178 --> 00:42:52,175
Elly?

592
00:42:57,435 --> 00:42:58,051
Sepideh!

593
00:42:59,228 --> 00:43:00,558
Do not go!

594
00:43:07,153 --> 00:43:07,854
Sepideh!

595
00:45:23,797 --> 00:45:24,995
What happened?

596
00:45:27,384 --> 00:45:30,385
- We didn't find her.
- Do not stop!

597
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:37,726
The sea is rough.

598
00:45:37,935 --> 00:45:40,687
You can't just stop like that.

599
00:45:40,939 --> 00:45:43,394
Wait!
Take me.

600
00:45:46,362 --> 00:45:48,983
She may be trapped
between the rocks.

601
00:45:49,949 --> 00:45:51,408
Let us go!

602
00:45:52,243 --> 00:45:55,861
Take me, I beg you!

603
00:45:58,291 --> 00:46:00,663
You didn't look over there.

604
00:46:06,549 --> 00:46:08,459
That's where they found the child.

605
00:46:14,683 --> 00:46:17,055
We can not leave her like that.

606
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:20,178
At daybreak
the sea will calm.

607
00:46:22,274 --> 00:46:26,652
Where are you going? I beg you.
She  may still be alive.

608
00:46:26,862 --> 00:46:29,532
We searched
for over half an hour.

609
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:31,567
Pity! If she is alive ...

610
00:46:31,784 --> 00:46:33,611
She can't be alive anymore.

611
00:46:33,828 --> 00:46:36,401
Did I ask you?

612
00:46:36,622 --> 00:46:39,114
Sepideh! Go inside!

613
00:46:39,334 --> 00:46:40,662
Shohreh, take her!

614
00:46:43,421 --> 00:46:46,340
Peyman, don't let them leave.

615
00:46:46,549 --> 00:46:48,791
The sea will bring back the body.

616
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:52,261
If you browse the beach tonight
you will find her.

617
00:46:53,473 --> 00:46:54,138
Sepideh!

618
00:47:57,749 --> 00:47:59,292
Sepideh.

619
00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:06,123
They want details
Her identity.

620
00:48:40,419 --> 00:48:44,084
She was playing with her kite
and she saw nothing.

621
00:48:44,297 --> 00:48:46,337
You've seen her go into the water?

622
00:48:46,549 --> 00:48:48,709
- No.
- What did you see?

623
00:48:49,052 --> 00:48:50,843
- Arash screaming in the water.
- And then?

624
00:48:51,054 --> 00:48:52,632
This is my son.

625
00:48:52,848 --> 00:48:56,264
I called my father
to come save him.

626
00:48:56,476 --> 00:48:59,681
Okay. Are you sure the woman
went in the water?

627
00:48:59,938 --> 00:49:02,690
I asked her
to watch the children.

628
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:04,358
What was her name?

629
00:49:04,568 --> 00:49:06,312
- Elly.
- Elly?

630
00:49:07,321 --> 00:49:10,026
Elham Elnaz, Elmira ...?
The full name.

631
00:49:11,867 --> 00:49:13,908
Don't you know her?

632
00:49:14,121 --> 00:49:15,318
She called Elly.

633
00:49:15,538 --> 00:49:17,081
What was your relationship with her?

634
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:22,582
It was my daughter's teacher.
My wife invited her.

635
00:49:22,837 --> 00:49:26,005
You don't know the name
of your daughter's teacher?

636
00:49:26,508 --> 00:49:27,884
I will ask.

637
00:49:29,010 --> 00:49:32,345
You bring
someone from Tehran

638
00:49:32,557 --> 00:49:34,513
without knowing anything about her

639
00:49:34,724 --> 00:49:36,802
and we
we have to rely on a child?

640
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:38,264
What's her name?

641
00:49:38,771 --> 00:49:40,479
I don't know.

642
00:49:40,898 --> 00:49:42,607
You don't know her name?

643
00:49:51,033 --> 00:49:52,942
Unfortunately, she does not know.

644
00:49:54,246 --> 00:49:58,160
Have a look in her bag.
She must have any papers.

645
00:49:59,501 --> 00:50:02,621
I would like the identities
of you.

646
00:50:03,087 --> 00:50:05,247
And your papers, please.

647
00:50:06,716 --> 00:50:08,341
Who is the owner of the villa?

648
00:50:29,448 --> 00:50:30,564
Ahmad!

649
00:50:31,868 --> 00:50:33,528
Her bag is not there!

650
00:50:33,911 --> 00:50:35,572
Just search a little better.

651
00:50:35,788 --> 00:50:36,987
I searched, there is nothing!

652
00:50:37,623 --> 00:50:40,162
Naazy, give me Peyman's bag ...

653
00:50:40,502 --> 00:50:42,245
Shohreh, her bag is not there!

654
00:50:43,921 --> 00:50:45,465
It must be in her room.

655
00:50:53,516 --> 00:50:54,714
What if she left?

656
00:51:00,857 --> 00:51:01,972
Didn't you say she was with the kids?

657
00:51:02,859 --> 00:51:04,768
She was ready to go.

658
00:51:05,236 --> 00:51:07,773
She wanted to go by foot.
Not true, Shohreh?

659
00:51:08,031 --> 00:51:09,524
Would she leave
without saying goodbye?

660
00:51:09,741 --> 00:51:10,986
And why is her purse gone?

661
00:51:11,325 --> 00:51:13,070
My God ...

662
00:51:17,207 --> 00:51:18,203
Sepideh!

663
00:51:28,052 --> 00:51:28,834
What's her number?

664
00:51:29,053 --> 00:51:30,381
- Who?
- Elly.

665
00:51:30,596 --> 00:51:31,841
I'll call her cellphone.

666
00:51:32,056 --> 00:51:33,384
What are you talking about?

667
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:34,678
- The bag ...
- What?

668
00:51:34,892 --> 00:51:37,348
It is not there.
Maybe she did really go.

669
00:51:37,562 --> 00:51:39,186
Nobody saw her going in the water.

670
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:47,730
I had to keep it hidden.

671
00:51:59,459 --> 00:52:01,618
I should have let her go.

672
00:52:02,421 --> 00:52:04,877
I should have let her go.

673
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:08,927
My God ...

674
00:52:50,096 --> 00:52:51,294
Mom!

675
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:26,333
God curse you, Sepideh.

676
00:53:29,261 --> 00:53:31,932
We have to notify his family.

677
00:53:33,224 --> 00:53:35,550
Wait and see
if the body shows up tonight.

678
00:53:35,851 --> 00:53:38,260
Maybe she really has left.

679
00:53:38,479 --> 00:53:39,642
Left where?

680
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:41,899
It's over.

681
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:43,809
She died.

682
00:53:44,068 --> 00:53:45,480
We should call them tomorrow.

683
00:53:45,696 --> 00:53:48,862
They will not make the road
at night ...

684
00:53:49,407 --> 00:53:53,986
Today will be a lot of traffic.
It's gonna be hell.

685
00:53:58,418 --> 00:53:59,662
Oh my!

686
00:54:03,882 --> 00:54:04,995
Damn!

687
00:57:25,008 --> 00:57:26,087
Amir ...

688
00:57:31,890 --> 00:57:34,844
If she had drowned
we would have found the body.

689
00:57:35,602 --> 00:57:37,429
Wake up,
we must do something.

690
00:57:39,189 --> 00:57:40,849
You've done enough already.

691
00:57:41,066 --> 00:57:43,557
Wake up, I say.

692
00:57:46,488 --> 00:57:49,573
For what?
Well, I'm awake.

693
00:57:49,784 --> 00:57:52,191
Letfs go look at the bus station.

694
00:57:52,411 --> 00:57:53,574
I don't know what to tell you ...

695
00:57:53,788 --> 00:57:55,330
Damn me.

696
00:57:55,539 --> 00:57:57,117
Yes damn me.

697
00:57:58,711 --> 00:58:02,292
There may be a chance
that she left.

698
00:58:02,839 --> 00:58:04,037
Listen, I'm talking to you.

699
00:58:04,257 --> 00:58:05,882
I don't want you to talk to me!

700
00:58:06,676 --> 00:58:08,254
You fucked up
and you want to talk?

701
00:58:08,470 --> 00:58:10,130
Listen, I'm exhausted, too.

702
00:58:11,222 --> 00:58:12,468
Why did you invite her?

703
00:58:12,974 --> 00:58:14,967
OK, it's my fault.
So what can we do now?

704
00:58:15,186 --> 00:58:17,094
Nothing more.

705
00:58:17,688 --> 00:58:19,265
You didn't need a consulter
for inviting her?

706
00:58:19,481 --> 00:58:21,770
- I thought that Ahmad ...
- Who are you, for Ahmad?

707
00:58:22,943 --> 00:58:24,437
His mother?

708
00:58:24,653 --> 00:58:26,943
His sister? Who are you?

709
00:58:35,665 --> 00:58:36,495
What's up Amir?

710
00:58:43,506 --> 00:58:45,084
Why should it be her fault?

711
00:58:45,301 --> 00:58:45,916
It's not her fault.

712
00:58:46,384 --> 00:58:47,927
Nothing ever is.

713
00:58:50,055 --> 00:58:51,383
I told her to invite Elly.

714
00:58:51,641 --> 00:58:53,348
You shouldn't have!

715
00:58:54,142 --> 00:58:55,802
Why didn't you ask someone else?

716
00:58:56,645 --> 00:58:57,641
You'll wake the children.

717
00:58:58,647 --> 00:59:00,972
For so many years
you don't know this fool?

718
00:59:01,191 --> 00:59:04,192
Who could have predicted
she would come with us ...

719
00:59:04,404 --> 00:59:06,313
She always takes care!

720
00:59:06,655 --> 00:59:08,695
You want to go to sea
Ask Sepideh!

721
00:59:08,909 --> 00:59:10,984
People want to meet:
Ask Sepideh!

722
00:59:11,202 --> 00:59:12,578
You look for a villa:
Sepideh!

723
00:59:12,787 --> 00:59:15,574
You need a ticket:
Sepideh!

724
00:59:16,082 --> 00:59:18,122
You wanna get married;
Sepideh!

725
00:59:21,755 --> 00:59:23,629
Go inside, we find a solution.

726
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:25,548
Solution?

727
00:59:25,884 --> 00:59:28,291
He have to call the parents.

728
00:59:28,511 --> 00:59:31,382
Okay. For now let's go inside.

729
00:59:31,891 --> 00:59:35,509
Kids, the one who tells it the best
will get  a huge gift.

730
00:59:35,894 --> 00:59:39,477
Go ahead and start.
What you did, you?

731
00:59:39,690 --> 00:59:42,181
I was with my kite.

732
00:59:42,401 --> 00:59:43,017
And then?

733
00:59:43,235 --> 00:59:45,312
Arash was in the water.

734
00:59:45,988 --> 00:59:47,945
And where was Elly?

735
00:59:48,158 --> 00:59:49,272
She was up there.

736
00:59:49,575 --> 00:59:50,856
On the terrace.

737
00:59:51,077 --> 00:59:52,072
What were you doing?

738
00:59:52,286 --> 00:59:55,785
I asked her to
set my kite.

739
00:59:55,998 --> 01:00:00,080
She came and played with
the kite. And then I saw Arash.

740
01:00:02,422 --> 01:00:05,838
When your kite was up there

741
01:00:06,092 --> 01:00:07,670
was Elly with you?

742
01:00:07,886 --> 01:00:12,429
Look at me. When you, were there
was Elly staining over there,

743
01:00:12,642 --> 01:00:15,393
where Naazy is standing now?

744
01:00:15,936 --> 01:00:18,687
She was there at the beginning.

745
01:00:19,773 --> 01:00:21,267
And after?

746
01:00:21,985 --> 01:00:27,608
I ran after my kite to
the other side.

747
01:00:28,325 --> 01:00:31,279
And there I saw Arash.

748
01:00:31,493 --> 01:00:32,656
You saw Arash.

749
01:00:34,455 --> 01:00:35,784
Stop it, Arash.

750
01:00:37,166 --> 01:00:40,417
Anita? Have you Elly
leave the villa?

751
01:00:43,339 --> 01:00:45,248
- Look at me.
- I have not seen.

752
01:00:48,554 --> 01:00:50,132
Morvarid, darling,

753
01:00:50,347 --> 01:00:55,139
when your kite
fell into the water,

754
01:00:55,352 --> 01:00:57,012
and Arash was drowning,

755
01:00:57,229 --> 01:01:00,314
was Elly there?
Or was she leaving the house?

756
01:01:00,525 --> 01:01:02,316
- She was there.
- Okay.

757
01:01:03,820 --> 01:01:07,899
When you came to call
and we played volleyball,

758
01:01:08,115 --> 01:01:10,653
you know, when you cried,

759
01:01:10,868 --> 01:01:12,363
Elly was still there?

760
01:01:12,578 --> 01:01:14,487
She was there before that.

761
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:16,998
Before, how long?

762
01:01:17,208 --> 01:01:17,990
A little.

763
01:01:18,209 --> 01:01:19,952
What is a little sweetie?

764
01:01:20,170 --> 01:01:21,914
1 to what?

765
01:01:22,131 --> 01:01:24,966
1 ... 2 ... 3 ... 4 ...?

766
01:01:26,175 --> 01:01:29,296
1 ... 2 ... 3 ...

767
01:01:31,723 --> 01:01:32,839
I don't know.

768
01:01:34,476 --> 01:01:35,639
And you, Arash, darling?

769
01:01:35,853 --> 01:01:39,353
When you were in the water,
Did Elly come to help you?

770
01:01:41,025 --> 01:01:42,436
Raise your head and answered correctly.

771
01:01:42,651 --> 01:01:43,682
I answered a hundred times yesterday.

772
01:01:43,903 --> 01:01:45,943
Sit down and answer well!

773
01:01:46,156 --> 01:01:47,899
- I'm hungry.
- Get out of here then!

774
01:01:48,408 --> 01:01:49,238
Peyman!

775
01:01:49,784 --> 01:01:52,157
What way is that to behave?

776
01:01:52,370 --> 01:01:55,040
- I was in the water, I saw nothing!

777
01:01:55,248 --> 01:01:56,410
What is wrong with you?

778
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:58,870
He answers strangely!

779
01:01:59,085 --> 01:02:02,289
Since yesterday evening
you mistreat this child!

780
01:02:02,506 --> 01:02:04,997
That's it, go away and shut up.

781
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:08,218
I am silent
and take everything?

782
01:02:08,429 --> 01:02:10,754
You let him alone at
the edge of the water!

783
01:02:11,055 --> 01:02:13,927
Has told you not to take
a villa on the beach!

784
01:02:16,604 --> 01:02:18,810
Anita, come.

785
01:02:32,412 --> 01:02:33,693
Any News?

786
01:02:34,747 --> 01:02:35,946
Nothing since yesterday evening.

787
01:02:37,458 --> 01:02:38,918
Why should she gone?

788
01:02:39,544 --> 01:02:41,205
Who knows.

789
01:02:42,256 --> 01:02:44,581
She would have taken her bag.

790
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:46,542
But Sepideh had hidden it ...

791
01:02:48,137 --> 01:02:49,335
Sepideh,

792
01:02:49,763 --> 01:02:51,756
Could Elly have done such a thing?

793
01:02:52,224 --> 01:02:53,220
What thing?

794
01:02:53,893 --> 01:02:55,636
Leaving without saying anything.

795
01:02:56,771 --> 01:02:57,601
I don't know.

796
01:02:57,814 --> 01:03:00,483
Why you did you hide her bag,
then?

797
01:03:00,858 --> 01:03:03,978
You thought that she could
leave like that.

798
01:03:04,237 --> 01:03:08,484
The other night as she disappeared.
He was looking everywhere.

799
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:10,823
It was because of her phone connection.

800
01:03:11,703 --> 01:03:13,197
She wanted to make a call.

801
01:03:13,538 --> 01:03:14,653
Without saying a word.

802
01:03:14,873 --> 01:03:17,031
- It's different.
- What?

803
01:03:17,334 --> 01:03:19,291
- Why should she leave?
- In spite.

804
01:03:19,503 --> 01:03:20,167
What?

805
01:03:20,546 --> 01:03:21,791
She may be upset.

806
01:03:24,133 --> 01:03:25,508
Why?

807
01:03:28,387 --> 01:03:33,014
Did anyone notice anything?
Or say anything upsetting to her?

808
01:03:33,225 --> 01:03:34,850
Dad, I'm hungry.

809
01:03:39,232 --> 01:03:42,683
The other night,
When I served grill

810
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:44,065
and you arrived

811
01:03:44,279 --> 01:03:49,439
the lady brought the beds,
she began to clap and sing.

812
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:51,818
And you, Shohreh,
you made noises.

813
01:03:52,621 --> 01:03:56,239
It seemed Elly was upset.

814
01:03:56,793 --> 01:03:59,544
Noises? It was a joke.

815
01:04:00,003 --> 01:04:01,284
I just thought.

816
01:04:01,505 --> 01:04:02,501
And for dinner?

817
01:04:03,465 --> 01:04:06,252
When she went to get the salt
we all laughed.

818
01:04:08,095 --> 01:04:10,421
But that was just a little fun.

819
01:04:10,639 --> 01:04:11,635
We all laughed.

820
01:04:11,849 --> 01:04:13,427
She too laughed.

821
01:04:13,642 --> 01:04:16,762
All this jokes, the dancing,

822
01:04:16,979 --> 01:04:17,975
Could that have embarrassed her?

823
01:04:18,189 --> 01:04:20,858
Yesterday morning
she insisted on leaving,

824
01:04:21,067 --> 01:04:22,691
as if she was worried about something.

825
01:04:22,902 --> 01:04:25,820
I told you not to force her to stay!

826
01:04:26,031 --> 01:04:27,608
She was just over there.

827
01:04:27,825 --> 01:04:29,699
You told her as a joke
she should go by foot

828
01:04:29,909 --> 01:04:31,535
and she said: "Ok I will."

829
01:04:40,003 --> 01:04:41,201
Sepideh?

830
01:04:41,922 --> 01:04:43,831
You who know her

831
01:04:44,049 --> 01:04:46,836
Was she such a person?

832
01:04:47,136 --> 01:04:48,511
To be offended and leave?

833
01:04:48,722 --> 01:04:49,966
Take offended by what?

834
01:04:50,557 --> 01:04:53,806
She doesn't even know her name.
How does she know?

835
01:04:54,018 --> 01:04:57,434
Amir, stop quibbling.
We try to move forward.

836
01:04:58,815 --> 01:05:03,062
When we did the dishes,
Sepideh, you said something,

837
01:05:03,611 --> 01:05:06,696
And Shohreh said:
"We like you even if you do nothing."

838
01:05:06,907 --> 01:05:08,531
I think that offended her.

839
01:05:10,745 --> 01:05:12,867
But I didn't mean any harm.

840
01:05:13,079 --> 01:05:17,540
I know. I say that there
may have been a misunderstanding.

841
01:05:17,793 --> 01:05:19,751
Please don't start
blaming me for that too!

842
01:05:19,963 --> 01:05:21,505
I didn't blame you.

843
01:05:21,714 --> 01:05:25,711
She must be very immature
to be offended by a sentence like that!

844
01:05:25,926 --> 01:05:26,756
Calm down, we are just talking!

845
01:05:26,970 --> 01:05:31,014
Did you see how they all look at
my son since yesterday evening?

846
01:05:31,223 --> 01:05:34,010
Nothing you said offended her.

847
01:05:34,226 --> 01:05:36,220
Ahmad, I talk about that!

848
01:05:36,437 --> 01:05:39,107
Even if she was offended,
that's not a reason to leave.

849
01:05:39,523 --> 01:05:41,267
If she is reasonable.

850
01:05:41,735 --> 01:05:44,357
But if she
really just left like that

851
01:05:44,571 --> 01:05:47,193
without saying anything, she really is a. ..

852
01:05:47,407 --> 01:05:48,320
Peyman ...

853
01:05:48,533 --> 01:05:52,662
We were told this place is open
to everybody. And if someone ...

854
01:05:52,871 --> 01:05:54,151
What are you talking here?

855
01:05:54,789 --> 01:05:57,246
Call Tehran,
see if she returned.

856
01:05:57,834 --> 01:06:00,586
It's too early. It's 7:30.

857
01:06:00,797 --> 01:06:03,880
So it is 7:30 !
I can't take it anymore.

858
01:06:04,091 --> 01:06:06,334
Ahmad, come, we'll call.

859
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:09,252
No, you don't move.
Ahmad, you go alone.

860
01:06:09,638 --> 01:06:10,920
- Why?
- You stay here.

861
01:06:11,140 --> 01:06:13,097
- But how ...
- Don't make it worse!

862
01:06:13,309 --> 01:06:15,182
It is better a woman calls.

863
01:06:15,395 --> 01:06:17,222
Sepideh is the only woman here?

864
01:06:18,606 --> 01:06:20,397
I could go too.

865
01:06:21,317 --> 01:06:23,108
But if they say she's not back ...

866
01:06:24,278 --> 01:06:26,105
Just thinking about it, makes me shake.

867
01:06:26,323 --> 01:06:28,648
- Amir, let me ...
- I said no!

868
01:06:29,534 --> 01:06:30,780
Ahmad, let's go.

869
01:06:31,369 --> 01:06:32,070
I come with you.

870
01:06:32,537 --> 01:06:33,367
It's Okay, I'm going.

871
01:06:33,581 --> 01:06:34,908
Come Manoochehr.

872
01:06:36,209 --> 01:06:37,122
Ahmad ...

873
01:06:38,169 --> 01:06:40,374
Sepideh, you give me her home number?

874
01:06:44,341 --> 01:06:45,587
You want me to go with them?

875
01:06:45,802 --> 01:06:47,344
Ahmad is going.

876
01:06:48,179 --> 01:06:50,302
Go get a breakfast
for the children.

877
01:06:50,514 --> 01:06:52,840
They may stay one day
without breakfast.

878
01:06:53,059 --> 01:06:55,051
For one day, they will not die!

879
01:06:55,269 --> 01:06:56,515
Keys.

880
01:06:57,606 --> 01:06:58,684
What a weekend!

881
01:07:06,490 --> 01:07:08,897
Go ..
No, wait.

882
01:07:09,118 --> 01:07:10,493
The other wheel is also stuck.

883
01:07:12,955 --> 01:07:13,785
Ahmad!

884
01:07:13,998 --> 01:07:16,406
It's stuck in sand.

885
01:07:18,294 --> 01:07:20,417
Come down, we'll make it.

886
01:07:28,138 --> 01:07:30,889
If her mother answers, say nothing.

887
01:07:31,557 --> 01:07:32,553
Why?

888
01:07:33,350 --> 01:07:36,186
The other day she told me
she has heart problems.

889
01:07:36,396 --> 01:07:38,519
I don't wanna shock her.

890
01:07:42,194 --> 01:07:47,104
A foreign person drowned because of
our child. You understand that?

891
01:07:47,324 --> 01:07:50,278
And your only problem,
is to go on my nerves?

892
01:07:50,494 --> 01:07:52,286
Do not talk like that.

893
01:07:53,956 --> 01:07:56,626
I told you  a 100 times not
to talk to me like that in public.

894
01:07:56,834 --> 01:07:58,412
Like what?

895
01:07:58,795 --> 01:08:02,460
I have no other concern now?
How am I talking?

896
01:08:02,672 --> 01:08:04,049
Like you did before.

897
01:08:04,259 --> 01:08:06,631
I have always been the same
since college.

898
01:08:06,845 --> 01:08:09,762
And in twenty years,
I will still be the same shit I am now.

899
01:08:10,223 --> 01:08:11,421
I want to go to Tehran.

900
01:08:11,724 --> 01:08:13,801
- You can not ...
- I want to go.

901
01:08:19,733 --> 01:08:20,646
Shohreh ...

902
01:08:20,858 --> 01:08:22,685
I want to go.

903
01:08:22,986 --> 01:08:26,153
The sound of the sea
drives me crazy.

904
01:08:26,364 --> 01:08:28,571
My son peed his bed.

905
01:08:28,867 --> 01:08:30,943
Everyone disrespects him.

906
01:08:31,162 --> 01:08:32,620
Am more worse than you all.

907
01:08:32,997 --> 01:08:35,618
The image of this girl
does not leave me ...

908
01:08:35,833 --> 01:08:38,205
Sepideh, you have an aspirin?

909
01:08:38,419 --> 01:08:40,578
Take paracetamol in my bag.

910
01:08:47,804 --> 01:08:48,800
Aain her  mother.

911
01:08:49,013 --> 01:08:50,342
Do not hang up this time.

912
01:08:51,307 --> 01:08:52,553
You say it is her heart ...

913
01:08:52,767 --> 01:08:53,716
Just say that you are

914
01:08:53,935 --> 01:08:57,185
a student's parent
and you want to talk with her.

915
01:08:57,396 --> 01:09:00,232
At this hour?

916
01:09:01,193 --> 01:09:02,735
What if this province number shows up?

917
01:09:03,111 --> 01:09:04,736
Say you're the husband of a girlfriend.

918
01:09:04,947 --> 01:09:06,322
Sepideh should have come.

919
01:09:13,789 --> 01:09:16,363
What a honeymoon
I am so sorry ...

920
01:09:17,209 --> 01:09:18,953
Thank you, my boy.

921
01:09:20,963 --> 01:09:22,623
Honk.

922
01:09:25,885 --> 01:09:27,048
Where you going?

923
01:09:27,262 --> 01:09:28,672
I was worried.

924
01:09:28,888 --> 01:09:30,218
- Was she in Tehran?

925
01:09:30,432 --> 01:09:31,179
Get in.

926
01:09:33,685 --> 01:09:34,965
What happened?

927
01:09:35,353 --> 01:09:37,476
Did she have family problems?

928
01:09:37,689 --> 01:09:38,804
Why?

929
01:09:39,191 --> 01:09:40,851
Her mother was very evasive.

930
01:09:41,068 --> 01:09:42,645
She was not back then?

931
01:09:42,987 --> 01:09:44,814
She said she went out for a minute.

932
01:09:45,322 --> 01:09:47,565
Thank you, my God.

933
01:09:47,783 --> 01:09:48,898
No, wait.

934
01:09:49,118 --> 01:09:51,988
At first she said that
I asked if she returned from the trip.

935
01:09:52,204 --> 01:09:53,997
She said: "What trip?"

936
01:09:54,206 --> 01:09:56,199
- What?
- She lied to me.

937
01:09:56,710 --> 01:10:00,541
In addition, she said
that Elly left her mobile phone at home.

938
01:10:00,755 --> 01:10:02,415
But she had it with her.

939
01:10:03,383 --> 01:10:05,091
She asked me ten times
who I was.

940
01:10:05,551 --> 01:10:07,592
Did her family know
she came with us?

941
01:10:08,304 --> 01:10:11,424
Didn't she call her mother,
the other night?

942
01:10:11,641 --> 01:10:14,476
Yes, but her mother ...

943
01:10:15,021 --> 01:10:15,886
His mother ...

944
01:10:16,146 --> 01:10:19,516
She answered really suspicious.

945
01:10:19,733 --> 01:10:22,817
Maybe because we hung up
several times before Éshe was suspicious.

946
01:10:23,028 --> 01:10:27,275
But if she had confidence in her daughter
why be suspecious?

947
01:10:28,283 --> 01:10:29,742
How long do you know her?

948
01:10:31,078 --> 01:10:32,572
Not long.

949
01:10:53,018 --> 01:10:54,181
What happened?

950
01:10:57,899 --> 01:10:59,607
Nobody piked up the phone.

951
01:10:59,816 --> 01:11:02,355
Damn what a bummer!

952
01:11:04,322 --> 01:11:06,278
You should've tried again.

953
01:11:06,532 --> 01:11:07,314
Ahmad ...

954
01:11:07,533 --> 01:11:10,238
We tried ten times.

955
01:11:16,001 --> 01:11:17,080
Sepideh.

956
01:11:17,460 --> 01:11:18,373
Come here.

957
01:11:24,592 --> 01:11:25,837
What's up?

958
01:11:30,724 --> 01:11:32,099
Where is her phone?

959
01:11:32,309 --> 01:11:33,424
Why?

960
01:11:33,643 --> 01:11:36,894
Let's call a number in
her phone.

961
01:11:37,106 --> 01:11:39,015
She's took it with her.

962
01:11:39,776 --> 01:11:40,807
Where's That?

963
01:11:41,026 --> 01:11:44,110
I don't know.
Why are you asking me this?

964
01:11:44,322 --> 01:11:45,519
Come here.

965
01:11:45,739 --> 01:11:48,361
- What is it?
- Tell me what you know about her.

966
01:11:48,575 --> 01:11:50,367
What I know about her?

967
01:11:52,747 --> 01:11:55,582
Whose is that?
It's hers, right?

968
01:11:55,875 --> 01:11:58,201
- Where was it?
- In your bag.

969
01:11:58,586 --> 01:12:00,544
Why is her mobile phone in your bag?

970
01:12:01,339 --> 01:12:02,252
I forgot.

971
01:12:02,466 --> 01:12:06,510
I found it yesterday
by the windows.

972
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:08,879
Don't lie to me!

973
01:12:09,098 --> 01:12:10,295
What is wrong with you?

974
01:12:10,515 --> 01:12:11,844
Leave me alone.

975
01:12:12,058 --> 01:12:14,301
Stop! Asshole!

976
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:18,387
What's the matter?
Why don't you speak?

977
01:12:18,858 --> 01:12:19,521
Bitch!

978
01:12:19,734 --> 01:12:22,354
Amir, are you not ashamed?
Get off!

979
01:12:22,820 --> 01:12:24,363
Don't you meddle with it!

980
01:12:24,572 --> 01:12:26,150
Don't you meddle with it, Shohreh.

981
01:12:26,698 --> 01:12:28,407
Get in the car.

982
01:12:29,368 --> 01:12:30,530
You should be ashamed!

983
01:12:30,745 --> 01:12:32,537
Get in the car.

984
01:12:32,747 --> 01:12:34,372
Peyman, lets return to Tehran.

985
01:12:34,832 --> 01:12:36,457
She is dead!

986
01:12:36,667 --> 01:12:38,412
Now you want
to kill us, too?

987
01:12:39,129 --> 01:12:40,326
I'm not staying here.

988
01:12:40,546 --> 01:12:43,216
- What did you do?
- She lies to me.

989
01:12:43,425 --> 01:12:44,883
I want to know ...

990
01:12:45,093 --> 01:12:47,666
Why is her phone
in your bag?

991
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:49,426
What the hell?

992
01:12:49,639 --> 01:12:52,974
You'd better
shut up Ahmad.

993
01:12:53,978 --> 01:12:55,353
Leave it Ahmad.

994
01:12:55,563 --> 01:12:58,054
Nobody said anything here?

995
01:12:58,482 --> 01:13:01,104
You do as you like.
Me, I'm leaving!

996
01:13:01,318 --> 01:13:03,644
You go, Sepideh.

997
01:13:08,201 --> 01:13:09,316
Ahmad!

998
01:13:09,535 --> 01:13:10,864
Go back, please.

999
01:13:11,079 --> 01:13:13,367
Morvarid, go inside, my dear.

1000
01:13:13,582 --> 01:13:14,530
Peyman ...

1001
01:13:17,751 --> 01:13:19,791
It makes me crazy.

1002
01:13:25,469 --> 01:13:30,131
We will send the women
and children in Tehran.

1003
01:13:34,687 --> 01:13:36,928
She forced me
to raise my hands on it.

1004
01:13:39,483 --> 01:13:41,522
We can't just leave.

1005
01:13:41,819 --> 01:13:43,443
Everybody wants to go.

1006
01:13:43,655 --> 01:13:45,363
Let's go, Mom.

1007
01:13:45,573 --> 01:13:47,281
It's hard for the kids.

1008
01:13:47,492 --> 01:13:49,780
You go ..
I've got to stay.

1009
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:53,571
Sepideh,
your presence will not change anything.

1010
01:13:53,790 --> 01:13:55,498
I can not, Peyman.

1011
01:13:55,709 --> 01:13:57,286
Naazy ...

1012
01:13:57,502 --> 01:13:58,747
She's hurt.

1013
01:14:00,464 --> 01:14:02,789
Sepideh, listen to me a bit ...

1014
01:14:03,008 --> 01:14:05,214
No, Ahmad.

1015
01:14:05,427 --> 01:14:09,176
If this girl really just left
silently,

1016
01:14:09,390 --> 01:14:11,928
is it worth
you give yourself all this trouble?

1017
01:14:12,142 --> 01:14:14,383
For a girl you don't know nothing about?

1018
01:14:14,603 --> 01:14:16,395
- Peyman ...
- No, really?

1019
01:14:16,605 --> 01:14:17,471
Peyman.

1020
01:14:17,690 --> 01:14:21,308
And if she drowned because of Arash,
isn't she worth it?

1021
01:14:21,527 --> 01:14:25,311
Who says she drowned
for my Arash?

1022
01:14:25,531 --> 01:14:29,197
And I didn't even said
she should watch my child that ...

1023
01:14:29,661 --> 01:14:31,238
Let her, if she wants to stay.

1024
01:14:31,454 --> 01:14:33,246
We are discussing, Peyman.

1025
01:14:33,456 --> 01:14:35,330
Why bother?

1026
01:14:38,295 --> 01:14:43,669
Was it me who invited her to the sea
and who kept her from leaving?

1027
01:14:43,884 --> 01:14:46,292
No, it was me.

1028
01:14:46,595 --> 01:14:49,003
You leave and leave me alone.

1029
01:14:59,442 --> 01:15:01,600
Get Ellyfs phone from Amir.

1030
01:15:03,321 --> 01:15:04,519
Amir ...

1031
01:15:06,074 --> 01:15:07,698
Give me Ellyfs phone please.

1032
01:15:11,538 --> 01:15:12,533
Thank you.

1033
01:15:18,795 --> 01:15:20,752
How can I unlock it?

1034
01:15:20,964 --> 01:15:24,001
Call one of the numbers.

1035
01:15:24,218 --> 01:15:27,468
What time did I go out
with her the other night?

1036
01:15:28,472 --> 01:15:30,512
About ten o'clock I think.

1037
01:15:31,267 --> 01:15:34,684
She received a call, she rejected
saying she would call back.

1038
01:15:34,895 --> 01:15:37,896
Call this number then
and tell the truth.

1039
01:15:38,107 --> 01:15:40,231
I think we should stay, too

1040
01:15:40,776 --> 01:15:44,442
If her family comes here and sees 4 guys,
isn't it weird?

1041
01:15:44,655 --> 01:15:46,897
Her mother was already very suspicious.

1042
01:15:47,116 --> 01:15:50,070
I thought no one answered?

1043
01:15:50,870 --> 01:15:53,326
Wait for me. I'll call.

1044
01:15:53,540 --> 01:15:55,248
We'll see what happens.

1045
01:15:56,793 --> 01:15:59,201
Have you spoken to her mother?

1046
01:15:59,963 --> 01:16:02,632
She didn't even know Elly
came on this trip.

1047
01:16:05,385 --> 01:16:06,299
Come Manoochehr.

1048
01:16:06,512 --> 01:16:09,003
- Where are the keys?
- On the car.

1049
01:16:10,516 --> 01:16:12,343
The car.

1050
01:16:15,062 --> 01:16:16,806
What a strange girl.

1051
01:16:17,022 --> 01:16:18,896
How did we find her phone?

1052
01:16:19,108 --> 01:16:20,567
In Sepideh's bag.

1053
01:16:20,985 --> 01:16:25,612
Naazy was looking for pills
and  found it.

1054
01:16:34,041 --> 01:16:35,534
Wait, Ahmad.

1055
01:16:43,425 --> 01:16:44,540
Where are you going?

1056
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:46,753
- Making a phone call.
- Who?

1057
01:16:46,970 --> 01:16:48,844
The Number that
called the other night.

1058
01:16:49,056 --> 01:16:51,725
- I come with you.
- You know your husband ...

1059
01:16:51,934 --> 01:16:52,716
I come.

1060
01:16:52,935 --> 01:16:54,809
I call and I'll be back.

1061
01:16:55,063 --> 01:16:56,260
Mom, I'm coming too.

1062
01:16:57,022 --> 01:16:57,854
Ahmad ...

1063
01:16:58,692 --> 01:17:00,066
Go alone.

1064
01:17:10,245 --> 01:17:12,452
Shohreh told me to watch
the Children.

1065
01:17:16,002 --> 01:17:18,623
Do you remember the pantomime game?

1066
01:17:20,172 --> 01:17:22,249
At one time, Elly said:''Gladiolus.''

1067
01:17:23,050 --> 01:17:27,427
Like a premonition. She felt
what would happen to her.

1068
01:17:29,348 --> 01:17:33,642
All this was written.
Nobody is responsible.

1069
01:17:33,852 --> 01:17:35,846
I had a dream.

1070
01:17:36,064 --> 01:17:37,013
What dream?

1071
01:17:37,481 --> 01:17:38,977
A nightmare.

1072
01:17:40,527 --> 01:17:43,314
I can't forget it.

1073
01:17:45,365 --> 01:17:46,563
Shall we turn around?

1074
01:17:47,450 --> 01:17:49,491
No. Drive a little more.

1075
01:18:21,737 --> 01:18:23,195
- She hasn't returned?
- No.

1076
01:18:25,199 --> 01:18:26,444
Who did you talk to?

1077
01:18:26,950 --> 01:18:29,192
- Her brother.
- You told her?

1078
01:18:29,494 --> 01:18:31,784
I described Elly.

1079
01:18:31,996 --> 01:18:35,911
I said
I found his number on her Phone.

1080
01:18:36,127 --> 01:18:40,041
If he knows where
she is.

1081
01:18:40,255 --> 01:18:41,715
He was surprised that
I have her phone.

1082
01:18:41,924 --> 01:18:46,421
I asked what their relationship was.
He said he was her brother.

1083
01:18:46,637 --> 01:18:49,591
But he doesn't know where she is.

1084
01:18:50,349 --> 01:18:52,010
I had to tell him the truth.

1085
01:18:52,644 --> 01:18:55,100
- You said that she drowned?
- No, I couldn't.

1086
01:18:57,773 --> 01:18:59,481
I said we had an
accident here in the north.

1087
01:18:59,693 --> 01:19:01,269
and that she was in the hospital.

1088
01:19:01,778 --> 01:19:03,984
He was surprised
that she is in the north.

1089
01:19:04,364 --> 01:19:05,609
She didn't tell her family.

1090
01:19:07,742 --> 01:19:10,411
That's why
she wanted to return so eagerly.

1091
01:19:10,704 --> 01:19:12,496
And now he comes here?

1092
01:19:12,706 --> 01:19:14,200
Yes, he will.

1093
01:19:14,416 --> 01:19:17,287
He arrives around 16h to Chalous.

1094
01:19:19,046 --> 01:19:20,790
How are we gonna tell him?

1095
01:19:22,049 --> 01:19:24,088
We have to somehow.

1096
01:19:25,303 --> 01:19:27,296
One woman has to come with us.

1097
01:19:28,515 --> 01:19:31,053
- A women has to come.
- What?

1098
01:19:31,601 --> 01:19:33,510
One of you must go.

1099
01:19:44,406 --> 01:19:47,324
Stop, Ahmad. I feel bad.

1100
01:19:49,870 --> 01:19:51,412
You haven't eaten anything.

1101
01:19:56,210 --> 01:19:58,001
Do you need anything?

1102
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:15,559
Should I take Naazy instead?

1103
01:20:20,235 --> 01:20:21,694
It's not his brother.

1104
01:20:23,446 --> 01:20:24,727
Who?

1105
01:20:25,699 --> 01:20:28,071
One who is coming.

1106
01:20:30,579 --> 01:20:34,624
She told me
she was an only child.

1107
01:20:37,420 --> 01:20:39,128
So who is this guy?

1108
01:20:44,469 --> 01:20:46,710
I think ... her fianc?.

1109
01:20:51,392 --> 01:20:52,721
Who's fianc??

1110
01:20:54,562 --> 01:20:55,677
Elly's.

1111
01:21:01,445 --> 01:21:03,983
What you're saying, Sepideh?

1112
01:21:05,866 --> 01:21:07,029
She was engaged?

1113
01:21:11,455 --> 01:21:13,615
What have you done?

1114
01:21:15,460 --> 01:21:17,037
What have you done?

1115
01:21:20,631 --> 01:21:24,759
If you knew she was engaged,
why did you introduce her to me?

1116
01:21:25,094 --> 01:21:28,713
She wanted to break up.
She tried for 6 months.

1117
01:21:29,933 --> 01:21:31,759
The guy won't leave her.

1118
01:21:33,144 --> 01:21:34,556
Oh God ...

1119
01:21:36,940 --> 01:21:38,269
Oh God ...

1120
01:21:39,235 --> 01:21:42,520
I had hidden her phone
so no one could call him.

1121
01:22:12,435 --> 01:22:13,633
Is that him?

1122
01:22:14,020 --> 01:22:15,514
The one with the bag?

1123
01:22:16,773 --> 01:22:17,804
I don't know.

1124
01:22:24,866 --> 01:22:26,609
Hello, how are you?

1125
01:22:26,950 --> 01:22:28,529
You've arrived?

1126
01:22:29,703 --> 01:22:32,195
We are on the spot.

1127
01:22:32,539 --> 01:22:36,240
In front of the surgical clinic.

1128
01:22:36,460 --> 01:22:37,326
Imam Reza.

1129
01:22:37,546 --> 01:22:39,538
The Clinique Imam Reza.

1130
01:22:41,007 --> 01:22:43,711
Where? A green sedan?

1131
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:46,796
I don't see it.

1132
01:22:50,267 --> 01:22:53,682
On the other side of the bridge?
At the entrance to the ring ...

1133
01:22:54,021 --> 01:22:56,892
Yes, very well.
I'll be right there.

1134
01:22:57,107 --> 01:23:00,642
We have a Patrol.
Well, see you soon.

1135
01:23:00,902 --> 01:23:02,979
- He came by car?
- Yes.

1136
01:23:04,866 --> 01:23:06,905
- You drive back with him.
- No.

1137
01:23:07,117 --> 01:23:08,577
We have no choice.

1138
01:23:08,786 --> 01:23:11,573
I have to drive ahead
and warn the others.

1139
01:23:23,051 --> 01:23:25,721
He doesn't know, that we
know he is her fianc?.

1140
01:23:25,929 --> 01:23:26,594
Okay.

1141
01:23:26,805 --> 01:23:29,046
I drive and tell the others.
You drive with him.

1142
01:23:29,265 --> 01:23:31,555
- Be very careful.
- I know.

1143
01:23:39,025 --> 01:23:39,855
Good day.

1144
01:23:40,528 --> 01:23:41,689
- Are you Ali Reza?
- Yes.

1145
01:23:41,903 --> 01:23:43,860
Ahmad. Delighted.

1146
01:23:44,073 --> 01:23:46,030
Have you been here long?

1147
01:23:46,242 --> 01:23:47,784
Did you have the accident?

1148
01:23:48,410 --> 01:23:50,201
No, one of our friends.

1149
01:23:50,413 --> 01:23:52,322
In which hospital is she?

1150
01:23:52,540 --> 01:23:54,367
- Wefll take you there.
- How is she?

1151
01:23:54,583 --> 01:23:57,704
- We better hurry.
- Go ..

1152
01:23:58,128 --> 01:23:59,327
Could you give me her phone?

1153
01:23:59,548 --> 01:24:00,957
It is at the villa.

1154
01:24:01,173 --> 01:24:02,206
Tell me about ...

1155
01:24:02,426 --> 01:24:05,380
I'll tell you.
Ahmad, you go.

1156
01:24:05,595 --> 01:24:06,924
I tell you.

1157
01:24:08,222 --> 01:24:09,337
Where do we go?

1158
01:24:10,933 --> 01:24:12,891
We take the bypass.

1159
01:24:13,103 --> 01:24:14,727
Please talk to me.

1160
01:24:16,273 --> 01:24:17,222
We told you on the phone.

1161
01:24:18,358 --> 01:24:19,557
Is she alive?

1162
01:24:22,530 --> 01:24:25,981
Yes, but she's not doing good.

1163
01:24:28,953 --> 01:24:30,495
She is in a coma.

1164
01:24:30,789 --> 01:24:32,746
Oh, my God!

1165
01:24:33,166 --> 01:24:37,294
She was not supposed to come here.
When was the accident?

1166
01:24:37,671 --> 01:24:39,213
We talk on the road.

1167
01:24:39,421 --> 01:24:42,507
Madam, stop confusing me.

1168
01:24:42,801 --> 01:24:44,379
You've seen her papers.

1169
01:24:45,053 --> 01:24:46,630
What is her name?

1170
01:24:47,806 --> 01:24:49,051
Elly.

1171
01:24:52,143 --> 01:24:54,017
Elly appears
on her papers?

1172
01:24:56,399 --> 01:24:59,565
Elly is the teacher of my daughter.

1173
01:25:00,111 --> 01:25:02,149
We did not want to scare you.

1174
01:25:02,363 --> 01:25:04,936
She came with us
for the weekend and...

1175
01:25:05,616 --> 01:25:06,565
What are you waiting here?

1176
01:25:06,783 --> 01:25:08,444
And the story of the accident?

1177
01:25:08,661 --> 01:25:11,366
I'm sorry. Let's go.

1178
01:25:11,581 --> 01:25:14,416
What is it?

1179
01:25:15,502 --> 01:25:16,699
I'm not on my plate ...

1180
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:19,328
- Me neither.
- Keep your donkey mouth shut.

1181
01:25:20,339 --> 01:25:23,756
- Go away mister!
- Shut up!

1182
01:25:29,349 --> 01:25:32,185
Hi, Ahmad!

1183
01:25:38,275 --> 01:25:39,900
Good morning.

1184
01:25:44,490 --> 01:25:45,404
Amir!

1185
01:25:45,742 --> 01:25:47,152
Peyman, Shohreh!

1186
01:25:47,368 --> 01:25:48,447
Where is Amir?

1187
01:25:48,660 --> 01:25:49,824
Come Naazy, quickly.

1188
01:25:51,331 --> 01:25:53,205
Peyman, come.

1189
01:25:56,044 --> 01:25:57,159
So, Ahmad?

1190
01:25:57,712 --> 01:25:59,123
Hurry, Amir.

1191
01:25:59,339 --> 01:26:00,288
Come all.

1192
01:26:03,885 --> 01:26:06,008
Hurry. he is coming.

1193
01:26:06,221 --> 01:26:07,550
You told him?

1194
01:26:07,806 --> 01:26:09,550
He is not her brother.

1195
01:26:09,933 --> 01:26:10,965
It is her fianc?.

1196
01:26:12,436 --> 01:26:14,014
She has a fianc??

1197
01:26:14,231 --> 01:26:15,309
Damn!

1198
01:26:15,523 --> 01:26:16,518
What does that mean?

1199
01:26:16,732 --> 01:26:20,944
The bottom line is that he believes
we are not aware.

1200
01:26:21,821 --> 01:26:24,526
She came here
she dragged with you,

1201
01:26:24,740 --> 01:26:26,448
and is engaged?

1202
01:26:26,659 --> 01:26:28,284
Pity, Peyman, now is not the time.

1203
01:26:29,329 --> 01:26:30,360
How did you know?

1204
01:26:30,580 --> 01:26:32,869
One of her girlfriends
called on her cellphone.

1205
01:26:33,458 --> 01:26:36,827
I told her about the accident

1206
01:26:37,046 --> 01:26:38,623
and the arrival of her brother.

1207
01:26:40,340 --> 01:26:42,333
She told me Elly
was an only daughter.

1208
01:26:42,552 --> 01:26:44,923
I asked who this man was.

1209
01:26:45,387 --> 01:26:47,676
gProbably her fianc?,h
she said.

1210
01:26:47,931 --> 01:26:50,885
Why did she come with us
if she is engaged?

1211
01:26:51,435 --> 01:26:53,641
She didn't look like
such a person.

1212
01:26:53,854 --> 01:26:56,392
She did.
It's just us who are ...

1213
01:26:57,233 --> 01:26:58,513
naive.

1214
01:26:59,610 --> 01:27:03,940
So, if it is,
she did not drown.

1215
01:27:04,156 --> 01:27:05,699
Maybe she really just left.

1216
01:27:05,908 --> 01:27:09,824
If this guys finds out
why we brought his bride here,

1217
01:27:10,038 --> 01:27:11,699
we are in big trouble.

1218
01:27:11,915 --> 01:27:13,458
Now what?

1219
01:27:13,666 --> 01:27:16,371
We pretend to know nothing.

1220
01:27:16,795 --> 01:27:21,836
He is the brother.
Elly is the teacher of Morvarid.

1221
01:27:22,050 --> 01:27:23,794
The childs wanted Elly
to come with us.

1222
01:27:24,010 --> 01:27:25,422
She agreed. That's it.

1223
01:27:25,762 --> 01:27:28,929
I beg you
get a grip of yourself.

1224
01:27:29,142 --> 01:27:31,893
What if Elly hasn't drowned?

1225
01:27:32,436 --> 01:27:33,552
I don't know ...

1226
01:27:33,771 --> 01:27:35,181
Where is Sepideh?

1227
01:27:37,107 --> 01:27:38,057
They drive together.

1228
01:27:38,359 --> 01:27:39,818
She is aware of everything?

1229
01:27:40,028 --> 01:27:42,020
Yes, I told her.

1230
01:27:42,656 --> 01:27:45,361
She is supposed to
tell him about the drowning.

1231
01:27:45,576 --> 01:27:48,659
What an actresses makes us all
going crazy!

1232
01:27:49,913 --> 01:27:52,320
I have to warn the children.

1233
01:27:52,540 --> 01:27:54,165
Where are they?

1234
01:27:54,668 --> 01:27:56,245
Arash ... Morvarid ...

1235
01:28:03,969 --> 01:28:07,669
Children, come here.
Listen to me.

1236
01:28:08,724 --> 01:28:10,883
You know why Elly
came here with us?

1237
01:28:11,102 --> 01:28:14,850
To watch me
not to go in the water.

1238
01:28:15,064 --> 01:28:17,390
- Bravo that's good.
- But no.

1239
01:28:17,608 --> 01:28:19,187
- Why then?
- Can I say?

1240
01:28:19,401 --> 01:28:21,894
She came to fall in love with you.

1241
01:28:23,197 --> 01:28:24,360
Me?

1242
01:28:24,991 --> 01:28:26,271
Who told you that?

1243
01:28:26,493 --> 01:28:27,655
I saw myself.

1244
01:28:27,869 --> 01:28:30,656
No, you're wrong.
It was a joke, all that.

1245
01:28:30,872 --> 01:28:32,035
Did you hear that, honey?

1246
01:28:32,248 --> 01:28:36,032
That's why she was sad
and she left.

1247
01:28:36,252 --> 01:28:38,460
No, my heart,
she was not sad.

1248
01:28:38,672 --> 01:28:41,876
She wanted to save Arash
and she drowned.

1249
01:28:42,093 --> 01:28:43,467
She is still in the water?

1250
01:28:43,678 --> 01:28:46,084
Morvarid listen. You too.

1251
01:28:46,472 --> 01:28:49,093
Elly's brother is coming here, ok?

1252
01:28:50,977 --> 01:28:53,931
It is a very serious
and is angry man.

1253
01:28:54,146 --> 01:28:55,772
You have to promise me.

1254
01:28:56,566 --> 01:28:58,724
Kids you have to promise...

1255
01:28:58,943 --> 01:29:04,364
not to tell about
our jokes.

1256
01:29:04,616 --> 01:29:07,023
- What jokes?
- Those mentioned by Arash.

1257
01:29:07,243 --> 01:29:09,569
When we played,
we danced, we laughed.

1258
01:29:09,787 --> 01:29:11,413
We used to play pantomime.

1259
01:29:11,622 --> 01:29:14,660
Don't say anything.

1260
01:29:14,877 --> 01:29:18,709
If he asks a questions,
you say:''We do not know.''

1261
01:29:18,922 --> 01:29:20,417
-''We do not know.''
- Bravo.

1262
01:29:20,632 --> 01:29:22,506
Can you say that too Anita?
Good.

1263
01:30:06,013 --> 01:30:07,722
Did she tell him?

1264
01:30:12,145 --> 01:30:13,260
Don't go out.

1265
01:30:13,687 --> 01:30:16,060
Wait on a sign of Sepideh.

1266
01:30:52,687 --> 01:30:54,229
Come in.

1267
01:30:55,190 --> 01:30:55,972
No, okay.

1268
01:31:07,202 --> 01:31:08,661
Where did it happen?

1269
01:31:12,583 --> 01:31:13,957
There.

1270
01:31:53,792 --> 01:31:56,829
- Come, go.
- I want to be alone for a moment.

1271
01:32:33,208 --> 01:32:35,367
What a quiet guy.

1272
01:32:36,378 --> 01:32:39,000
I swear he knows.

1273
01:32:39,590 --> 01:32:42,211
There must be
a reason for everything.

1274
01:32:43,219 --> 01:32:44,630
Shhh! Here he comes.

1275
01:33:20,591 --> 01:33:22,050
Do you a sedative?

1276
01:33:22,259 --> 01:33:23,718
No. Toilets?

1277
01:33:25,972 --> 01:33:26,754
This way.

1278
01:33:45,410 --> 01:33:46,986
- Thank you.
- I beg you.

1279
01:34:20,528 --> 01:34:22,153
Did he tell her parents?

1280
01:34:24,784 --> 01:34:26,111
Not yet.

1281
01:34:27,537 --> 01:34:29,245
Elly didn't tell you about him?

1282
01:34:31,582 --> 01:34:32,495
Amir!

1283
01:34:58,194 --> 01:35:00,186
Shohreh, you have a towel?

1284
01:35:00,404 --> 01:35:03,904
No, thank you.
Can I be alone somewhere?

1285
01:35:04,115 --> 01:35:05,527
This way.

1286
01:35:06,452 --> 01:35:07,993
Go ahead. I beg you.

1287
01:35:12,167 --> 01:35:14,289
Could you bring him a clean bedcover?

1288
01:36:09,184 --> 01:36:10,975
There is no connection here.

1289
01:36:14,690 --> 01:36:17,644
But I talked to her the other night.

1290
01:36:18,444 --> 01:36:20,567
Must have been
when she was out.

1291
01:36:27,036 --> 01:36:28,115
Excuse me ...

1292
01:36:29,747 --> 01:36:31,076
just a second.

1293
01:36:36,755 --> 01:36:38,794
Did she talk about me?

1294
01:36:41,008 --> 01:36:45,422
Yes, she talked a lot about you
and her parents.

1295
01:36:45,639 --> 01:36:47,181
What did she say?

1296
01:36:48,016 --> 01:36:51,101
That she misses you very much.

1297
01:36:51,562 --> 01:36:53,719
She spoke well of you.

1298
01:36:53,981 --> 01:36:55,808
She was worried for her mother.

1299
01:36:56,025 --> 01:37:00,187
I think her mother ... your mother
is a heart patient?

1300
01:37:12,542 --> 01:37:13,621
Naazy ...

1301
01:37:14,711 --> 01:37:16,419
- Sorry.
- Are you coming?

1302
01:37:31,770 --> 01:37:35,139
It's not his brother. Why do
you she missed him?

1303
01:37:35,524 --> 01:37:36,899
She spoke well of him?

1304
01:37:37,234 --> 01:37:38,728
I didn't know what to say.

1305
01:37:39,195 --> 01:37:40,475
Did he suspect anything?

1306
01:37:40,696 --> 01:37:42,321
No ... I do not know.

1307
01:38:04,513 --> 01:38:06,173
Don't you want to eat anything?

1308
01:38:09,059 --> 01:38:12,309
I just have to make a
call to Tehran.

1309
01:38:12,521 --> 01:38:14,978
- I accompany you.
- Okay.

1310
01:38:40,383 --> 01:38:45,211
You can leave the bed of the
newlyweds, I'll take it.

1311
01:38:45,680 --> 01:38:46,962
Thank you.

1312
01:38:51,061 --> 01:38:54,976
Her poor husband was there this morning
but I did not want to bother him.

1313
01:38:55,733 --> 01:38:58,224
- The husband of who?
- From the drowned.

1314
01:39:00,196 --> 01:39:01,904
Her husband was here this morning?

1315
01:39:10,164 --> 01:39:12,074
Madam, could you come here please?

1316
01:39:15,254 --> 01:39:16,203
Peyman!

1317
01:39:17,589 --> 01:39:18,371
He knows!

1318
01:39:21,217 --> 01:39:23,295
The old woman told him.

1319
01:39:23,929 --> 01:39:26,336
She said that the bed
was for Elly and her husband.

1320
01:39:26,556 --> 01:39:27,838
Damn!

1321
01:39:28,726 --> 01:39:30,101
Damn!

1322
01:39:31,437 --> 01:39:32,266
Where is he?

1323
01:39:32,605 --> 01:39:33,802
I guess he is coming.

1324
01:39:37,318 --> 01:39:39,109
Do something.

1325
01:39:39,320 --> 01:39:40,566
There's nothing more to do.

1326
01:39:40,822 --> 01:39:42,066
We have to say the truth.

1327
01:39:42,281 --> 01:39:43,611
We wanted to pair his wife
with someone?

1328
01:39:43,824 --> 01:39:45,154
We didn't know.

1329
01:39:45,618 --> 01:39:48,157
It is true that we knew nothing.

1330
01:39:48,496 --> 01:39:50,739
The best thing is to tell the truth.

1331
01:39:52,291 --> 01:39:53,157
But say what?

1332
01:39:53,377 --> 01:39:55,204
She didn't tell us
she was engaged.

1333
01:39:55,421 --> 01:39:58,587
Otherwise, we would never
present her to Ahmad.

1334
01:39:58,799 --> 01:40:00,542
Don't tell about Ahmad.

1335
01:40:00,801 --> 01:40:01,963
What else should we say then?

1336
01:40:02,428 --> 01:40:04,716
Among the cops
we'll have to confess everything.

1337
01:40:04,930 --> 01:40:06,970
Does he know she came
for Ahmad?

1338
01:40:07,682 --> 01:40:09,675
He is not stupid. He understood.

1339
01:40:09,894 --> 01:40:12,978
He was suspicious before coming.

1340
01:40:13,690 --> 01:40:16,359
Why does he pretend
to be her brother?

1341
01:40:17,693 --> 01:40:19,401
- We tell him everything.
- No, I beg you.

1342
01:40:19,612 --> 01:40:21,901
So what, Sepideh, lying?

1343
01:40:23,032 --> 01:40:24,610
We can't.

1344
01:40:24,825 --> 01:40:26,070
He knows anyway.

1345
01:40:26,370 --> 01:40:28,741
We have no choice, Sepideh.

1346
01:40:29,122 --> 01:40:32,122
- He will find out.
- Elly will be dishonored.

1347
01:40:32,333 --> 01:40:33,793
We dishonor her?

1348
01:40:34,002 --> 01:40:34,784
I respect the dead

1349
01:40:35,003 --> 01:40:37,624
but an engaged woman
looking for a husband.

1350
01:40:37,839 --> 01:40:38,788
This means:

1351
01:40:39,008 --> 01:40:40,631
1, she fooled us all,

1352
01:40:40,843 --> 01:40:42,586
2, she fooled her fianc?.

1353
01:40:43,136 --> 01:40:44,215
Fooled?

1354
01:40:44,430 --> 01:40:47,596
Obviously.
If you, you have a boyfriend

1355
01:40:47,808 --> 01:40:50,300
and your boyfriend
finds a girl better than you

1356
01:40:50,519 --> 01:40:52,097
for the weekend,
to play volleyball ...

1357
01:40:52,312 --> 01:40:53,594
Where's the harm?

1358
01:40:53,815 --> 01:40:54,893
You don't understand.

1359
01:40:55,107 --> 01:40:57,599
From our point of view,
there is no harm.

1360
01:40:57,860 --> 01:41:00,612
Put yourself in the position of the boy,
and everything is evil.

1361
01:41:01,031 --> 01:41:02,691
From the money she has given

1362
01:41:03,157 --> 01:41:04,783
to cleaning and staying here!

1363
01:41:05,285 --> 01:41:07,492
That was all a show she played for us!

1364
01:41:07,703 --> 01:41:09,364
We must decide now.

1365
01:41:11,208 --> 01:41:13,117
She gave up that nice boy.

1366
01:41:13,334 --> 01:41:15,743
I was ashamed of myself
when I saw him.

1367
01:41:16,547 --> 01:41:18,586
The the noise I made the other night ...

1368
01:41:18,798 --> 01:41:19,747
Hurry.

1369
01:41:19,967 --> 01:41:22,754
Ahmad, tell him
we thought she was single.

1370
01:41:22,970 --> 01:41:24,512
She lied to us.

1371
01:41:24,889 --> 01:41:26,597
- We say the truth.
- Please don't.

1372
01:41:26,932 --> 01:41:29,305
We lie to him
to save the honor of Elly?

1373
01:41:29,519 --> 01:41:31,641
The dead have no need of honor.

1374
01:41:32,521 --> 01:41:33,933
- I won't let it happen.
- Too late.

1375
01:41:35,107 --> 01:41:37,681
- Ahmad, don't let them ...
- Peyman come here.

1376
01:41:58,465 --> 01:42:00,837
I knew it.

1377
01:42:01,052 --> 01:42:02,083
She had told me.

1378
01:42:03,930 --> 01:42:06,301
I swear.
I'm not lying this time.

1379
01:42:06,891 --> 01:42:08,302
On the head of my daughter.

1380
01:42:08,684 --> 01:42:11,851
I told Ahmad
he was her fianc?.

1381
01:42:14,524 --> 01:42:16,314
Ahmad, why don't you tell them?

1382
01:42:16,651 --> 01:42:18,644
There is nothing more to say.

1383
01:42:19,654 --> 01:42:20,899
I told her

1384
01:42:21,114 --> 01:42:24,399
a friend arrived from Germany
and I was asked ...

1385
01:42:26,327 --> 01:42:28,819
to submit a woman.

1386
01:42:29,790 --> 01:42:32,577
She said she doesn't want
to get married.

1387
01:42:32,793 --> 01:42:36,743
That she has a fianc? for 2 years
and wants to break up.

1388
01:42:36,964 --> 01:42:39,585
She didn't love him.
He made her suffer.

1389
01:42:39,800 --> 01:42:44,877
Her family are against it,
and he also wouldn't let her go.

1390
01:42:46,057 --> 01:42:50,518
I offered her to meet our
friend Ahmad during his brief stay.

1391
01:42:50,728 --> 01:42:53,398
She said no,  not
until I haven't broken up.

1392
01:42:53,606 --> 01:42:57,651
I sent Ahmad a photo of her,
and he liked her.

1393
01:42:57,861 --> 01:43:00,530
So, I insisted her to come.

1394
01:43:05,202 --> 01:43:09,663
And she said ...?
She was determined to break.

1395
01:43:10,374 --> 01:43:14,418
I told her, if my friend
won't return to Iran anytime soon.

1396
01:43:14,878 --> 01:43:17,548
You should meet him just once.

1397
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:19,215
She still refused.

1398
01:43:19,425 --> 01:43:23,588
Finally, she agreed
provided that it remains a secret

1399
01:43:23,971 --> 01:43:25,880
and just for one night.

1400
01:43:26,349 --> 01:43:28,057
She had told me.

1401
01:43:34,065 --> 01:43:36,022
You insisted her to come.

1402
01:43:36,609 --> 01:43:38,354
But she wasn't forced to come?

1403
01:43:38,570 --> 01:43:43,196
I begged.
I said that I had everything planned.

1404
01:43:44,367 --> 01:43:45,149
My God!

1405
01:43:47,746 --> 01:43:49,786
We can at least save her honor.

1406
01:43:51,416 --> 01:43:55,960
If we say we really didn't know
she had a fianc?

1407
01:43:56,171 --> 01:43:57,251
would he believe that?

1408
01:43:57,464 --> 01:43:58,544
Who would believe that?

1409
01:43:58,757 --> 01:44:01,427
What does it change
if he believes it?

1410
01:44:01,760 --> 01:44:05,426
Anyway,
she did wrong by coming here.

1411
01:44:05,890 --> 01:44:07,170
But I insisted.

1412
01:44:08,017 --> 01:44:08,799
It's not a reason.

1413
01:44:09,060 --> 01:44:12,393
Tell the truth.
You say you didn't know.

1414
01:44:12,605 --> 01:44:14,848
Me, I say that I knew.

1415
01:44:15,191 --> 01:44:19,271
Everything is my fault.
Come what may.

1416
01:44:19,654 --> 01:44:22,441
You're unconscious!
He'll lynch you!

1417
01:44:22,824 --> 01:44:23,606
Too bad.

1418
01:44:23,825 --> 01:44:27,159
And then he sees us as a whole.

1419
01:44:27,370 --> 01:44:30,326
To him we are all acomplices.

1420
01:44:30,582 --> 01:44:33,583
Amir, do something.
I can't take it anymore.

1421
01:44:33,794 --> 01:44:36,119
Sepideh, just listen
for once in your life.

1422
01:44:36,338 --> 01:44:40,206
It is more than you and me.
We should all be together.

1423
01:44:41,177 --> 01:44:42,007
Ahmad

1424
01:44:42,553 --> 01:44:44,013
What do you think?

1425
01:44:47,183 --> 01:44:48,345
We tell him.

1426
01:44:48,976 --> 01:44:50,257
We say the truth.

1427
01:44:50,479 --> 01:44:51,676
Ok.

1428
01:44:52,231 --> 01:44:53,772
And you, Manoochehr?

1429
01:44:54,482 --> 01:44:56,641
We really didn't know
she was engaged.

1430
01:44:56,861 --> 01:44:58,983
Now we learned too late.

1431
01:45:03,617 --> 01:45:04,898
And you, Shohreh?

1432
01:45:05,535 --> 01:45:08,951
I have not the heart
to lie to this poor boy.

1433
01:45:09,915 --> 01:45:11,458
And you, Naazy?

1434
01:45:13,169 --> 01:45:14,497
I bow to the majority.

1435
01:45:14,711 --> 01:45:17,333
The majority seems to go
for the truth.

1436
01:45:17,799 --> 01:45:19,590
We were not aware.

1437
01:45:19,800 --> 01:45:20,963
Me, I was.

1438
01:45:21,176 --> 01:45:23,928
But you're alone.
And you just told us a minute ago!

1439
01:45:24,472 --> 01:45:25,385
He is coming.

1440
01:45:27,350 --> 01:45:30,019
Come, let's go together.

1441
01:45:30,853 --> 01:45:32,098
Peyman, watch out.

1442
01:45:32,980 --> 01:45:34,558
And the children? Arash?

1443
01:45:35,234 --> 01:45:38,021
Stay here, Sepideh.
Come Naazy.

1444
01:45:39,154 --> 01:45:42,155
Please don't make the
situation any worse.

1445
01:45:43,492 --> 01:45:45,531
What will he think about Elly?

1446
01:45:46,245 --> 01:45:48,533
Arash, Anita,

1447
01:45:49,666 --> 01:45:51,242
Morvarid, come quickly.

1448
01:46:14,065 --> 01:46:14,930
Ahmad!

1449
01:46:20,196 --> 01:46:21,275
Let me see, Ahmad!

1450
01:46:24,535 --> 01:46:25,365
Asshole!

1451
01:46:25,577 --> 01:46:27,238
Raise your head.

1452
01:46:28,206 --> 01:46:29,319
You are bleeding ...

1453
01:46:34,295 --> 01:46:37,996
I can put my hand on the Quran

1454
01:46:38,216 --> 01:46:41,299
to swear that we are telling the truth!

1455
01:46:42,344 --> 01:46:44,088
On the life of my children!

1456
01:46:44,306 --> 01:46:45,468
Dear Sir

1457
01:46:45,681 --> 01:46:47,390
there was no reason to lie to you.

1458
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:49,926
We came here with our families.

1459
01:46:50,145 --> 01:46:51,639
We did not organize
a meeting

1460
01:46:51,855 --> 01:46:54,311
between your fianc? and our friend.

1461
01:46:54,525 --> 01:46:56,102
We're not crazy!

1462
01:46:56,318 --> 01:46:59,651
If we had had the slightest suspicion,
we would not permit.

1463
01:46:59,864 --> 01:47:01,903
What is this discussion?

1464
01:47:02,115 --> 01:47:03,396
- Lets go sit down.
- You shut up!

1465
01:47:03,617 --> 01:47:04,780
Shut up, asshole!

1466
01:47:05,035 --> 01:47:07,112
- Stop!
- Go back, Ahmad!

1467
01:47:07,371 --> 01:47:08,533
That's enough!

1468
01:47:09,874 --> 01:47:12,162
We suffer for
two days!

1469
01:47:12,794 --> 01:47:14,418
No one has eaten for 2 days!

1470
01:47:15,170 --> 01:47:16,250
I ask!

1471
01:47:17,382 --> 01:47:19,256
I just want to
be told the truth!

1472
01:47:19,466 --> 01:47:22,836
I proposed to call the police.
You will see the report.

1473
01:47:23,054 --> 01:47:25,129
To hell with the police.

1474
01:47:25,474 --> 01:47:29,341
We can not lie to the police.
This will be a proof.

1475
01:47:29,560 --> 01:47:30,806
I don't want it!

1476
01:47:31,021 --> 01:47:32,479
It's the law, sir!

1477
01:47:32,689 --> 01:47:34,896
- Am I talking to you?
- Do you mind!

1478
01:47:35,108 --> 01:47:37,434
Come here, Shohreh, come.

1479
01:47:45,118 --> 01:47:47,112
Who brought Elly here?

1480
01:47:49,832 --> 01:47:50,995
My wife.

1481
01:47:51,876 --> 01:47:54,450
- She know her from the kids school.
- Where is she?

1482
01:47:55,338 --> 01:47:56,119
Inside.

1483
01:47:56,464 --> 01:47:58,089
I want to talk to her.

1484
01:47:59,592 --> 01:48:01,584
She is very ill.

1485
01:48:01,803 --> 01:48:03,594
Worse than me?

1486
01:48:04,890 --> 01:48:05,755
She sleeps.

1487
01:48:05,974 --> 01:48:08,050
We told you already.

1488
01:48:08,268 --> 01:48:10,842
I have a question to ask.

1489
01:48:11,146 --> 01:48:12,309
We go to the police ...

1490
01:48:12,521 --> 01:48:14,313
We'll go, okay.

1491
01:48:14,650 --> 01:48:17,770
- I want to talk ...
- She just fell asleep.

1492
01:48:17,986 --> 01:48:21,819
Do not be afraid.
I won't get any worse than this!

1493
01:48:27,955 --> 01:48:29,200
Where is she?

1494
01:48:29,916 --> 01:48:31,030
Madam!

1495
01:48:33,419 --> 01:48:34,414
Wait here.

1496
01:48:34,921 --> 01:48:35,952
I'm going.

1497
01:48:36,255 --> 01:48:39,541
Shohreh, call Sepideh.

1498
01:48:42,554 --> 01:48:45,045
I wanna talk to her alone.

1499
01:48:47,017 --> 01:48:47,966
Shohreh!

1500
01:49:01,282 --> 01:49:03,654
He is not guy you
can tell anything to.

1501
01:49:06,996 --> 01:49:09,404
He bashed Ahmad.

1502
01:49:11,042 --> 01:49:12,916
I say this for your own good.

1503
01:49:17,841 --> 01:49:19,418
Please, Sepideh,

1504
01:49:21,594 --> 01:49:22,460
Get up.

1505
01:49:23,930 --> 01:49:26,468
Go wash your face,
I call him in.

1506
01:49:27,310 --> 01:49:28,259
Get up, darling.

1507
01:50:22,408 --> 01:50:24,484
It was you who invited her?

1508
01:50:26,287 --> 01:50:27,995
Yes, it's me.

1509
01:50:33,169 --> 01:50:34,367
Can I sit down?

1510
01:50:34,587 --> 01:50:37,921
When you told her to
come and meet your friend,

1511
01:50:38,132 --> 01:50:39,212
she said nothing?

1512
01:50:44,891 --> 01:50:47,595
Can I say something,
before?

1513
01:50:48,685 --> 01:50:50,927
- Elly ...
- Listen to me.

1514
01:50:52,648 --> 01:50:55,852
I just want to know something ...

1515
01:50:56,360 --> 01:50:57,356
Sit.

1516
01:51:02,449 --> 01:51:04,111
It's yes or no.

1517
01:51:05,411 --> 01:51:07,238
- When she knew ...
- But ...

1518
01:51:08,414 --> 01:51:10,289
... Didn't she say no?

1519
01:51:10,542 --> 01:51:14,325
Didn't she say no?
I can't come, I have a fianc??

1520
01:51:14,545 --> 01:51:15,709
Did she?

1521
01:51:17,256 --> 01:51:19,130
Listen, really ...

1522
01:51:20,594 --> 01:51:22,966
Really, it ...

1523
01:51:23,180 --> 01:51:26,264
For me, it's important.

1524
01:51:26,474 --> 01:51:30,390
I gave her three years of my life.

1525
01:51:30,605 --> 01:51:33,274
You can sit too?

1526
01:51:41,491 --> 01:51:43,199
Didn't she refuse?

1527
01:51:48,122 --> 01:51:49,748
Yes or no?

1528
01:51:52,710 --> 01:51:55,333
No, she did not refuse.

1529
01:52:48,686 --> 01:52:49,884
Alireza,

1530
01:52:50,688 --> 01:52:53,226
the police called.

1531
01:52:53,691 --> 01:52:55,980
They have now found

1532
01:52:57,653 --> 01:53:00,192
the body of a woman in water.

1533
01:53:01,281 --> 01:53:03,406
You have to go identify her.

1534
01:53:06,872 --> 01:53:08,579
They called the house.

1535
01:53:12,084 --> 01:53:13,116
Amir!

1536
01:53:24,223 --> 01:53:25,421
Mr. ...

1537
01:53:27,393 --> 01:53:30,014
Wait, we all come with you.

1538
01:53:39,864 --> 01:53:41,240
You recognize her?

1539
01:54:20,698 --> 01:54:22,276
My condolences.

1540
01:54:33,462 --> 01:54:35,170
I would like my keys.

1541
01:54:37,383 --> 01:54:41,215
Will you
tell the family?

1542
01:54:41,428 --> 01:54:42,673
Do it yourself.

1543
01:54:43,889 --> 01:54:46,262
It would be better if you told them?

1544
01:54:47,305 --> 01:54:53,526
