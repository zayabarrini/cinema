MY LIFE TO LIVE

A CAFÉ - NANA WANTS TO GIVE UP -
PAUL - THE PINBALL MACHINE

10
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:14,694
Do you really like the guy?

11
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:18,031
I don't know.

12
00:03:18,491 --> 00:03:20,533
I wonder
what I was even thinking.

13
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:22,619
Does he have more money
than me?

14
00:03:22,787 --> 00:03:24,704
What do you care?

15
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:27,749
What do you care?

16
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:35,965
Something bothering you?

17
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:40,136
No, I just wanted to deliver
that line a specific way.

18
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:43,932
I didn't know
the best way to say it.

19
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:48,144
Or I did know,
but I don't anymore.

20
00:03:48,646 --> 00:03:52,982
Just when I should know, too.
Doesn't that ever happen to you?

21
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:56,403
Don't you ever talk
about anything but yourself?

22
00:03:56,946 --> 00:03:58,738
You're horrible.

23
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:03,868
I'm not horrible, Nana.
I'm sad.

24
00:04:04,787 --> 00:04:08,248
I'm not sad, Paul.
I'm horrible.

25
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:11,751
Don't talk nonsense.
This isn't a stage.

26
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:18,258
You never do as I ask, but you
always want me to do what you want.

27
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:21,761
Anyway, I'm fed up.
I want to die.

28
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:24,514
- Is that so?
- Yes, that's so.

29
00:04:24,682 --> 00:04:26,683
More nonsense.

30
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:32,188
It's exhausting loving you.
I always have to beg.

31
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:34,941
I exist too.

32
00:04:35,109 --> 00:04:38,111
You say I'm cruel,
but you're the cruel one.

33
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:53,001
Why do you say that? It isn't true.
You mean Sunday evening?

34
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:55,545
You know very well when.

35
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:58,506
I begged you
to introduce me to that man.

36
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,967
You did it on purpose.

37
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:02,677
Yes, I did.

38
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:05,013
You're pathetic.

39
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:10,310
If we started over,
I'd just cheat on you again.

40
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:12,145
Don't say that.

41
00:05:17,318 --> 00:05:18,735
Don't say that.

42
00:05:18,903 --> 00:05:20,153
It's true.

43
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:24,824
I thought it was important
we should meet, but I don't any more.

44
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:28,661
We might have
got together again.

45
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:31,915
But the more we talk,
the less the words mean.

46
00:05:33,209 --> 00:05:37,337
Anyway, if I make it on the stage,
it won't be thanks to you.

47
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:39,881
Acting isn't everything.

48
00:05:40,049 --> 00:05:42,258
Not you too!
Why do you say that?

49
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:45,178
If it's what I want,
why should you mind?

50
00:05:45,346 --> 00:05:48,014
I might be discovered
someday.

51
00:05:58,192 --> 00:06:00,401
Yes, you mustn't give up.

52
00:06:00,653 --> 00:06:03,029
I haven't given up music.

53
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:06,991
Not like your English lessons.
You were never really interested.

54
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:09,035
I'm not giving up.

55
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:11,871
In fact, that guy's going
to take pictures of me.

56
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:15,083
Maybe I'll get into the movies.

57
00:06:15,543 --> 00:06:17,502
That'll be the day.

58
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:20,213
You're horrible, Paul.

59
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,723
You're horrible, Paul.

60
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:35,311
You really are.
It's always the same.

61
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:40,692
You say you love me,
but you don't consider me special.

62
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:46,906
I hardly love you any more,
but I still consider you special.

63
00:06:47,408 --> 00:06:51,536
Why do you say things like that?
I think we're all the same.

64
00:06:52,288 --> 00:06:55,248
You don't approve of me
looking for work?

65
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:58,960
It suits you even less
than all the rest.

66
00:06:59,128 --> 00:07:02,422
Anyway, you're leaving me
because I'm poor.

67
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:05,049
When all's said and done, maybe.

68
00:07:06,427 --> 00:07:09,220
Have you got the pictures
you mentioned on the phone?

69
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,809
I forgot them. They'll be ready
at the end of the week.

70
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,980
Is he all right?
ls he eating well?

71
00:07:19,148 --> 00:07:22,525
He had an earache,
but the doctor said it was nothing.

72
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:25,153
What's your job at Pathé-Marconi?

73
00:07:25,321 --> 00:07:27,280
I sell records.

74
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:31,242
Can you lend me 2,000 francs?

75
00:07:32,036 --> 00:07:33,953
Out of the question.

76
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:39,167
Your parents
must be glad I'm gone.

77
00:07:39,335 --> 00:07:40,918
No, they liked you.

78
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:42,670
I'll bet.

79
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:46,382
What's that look for?

80
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:54,223
What's that look for?

81
00:07:54,475 --> 00:07:56,059
Nothing.

82
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,687
Let's not start quarreling again.

83
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:02,815
How about a game?

84
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:04,484
Sure.

85
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:11,199
Got a coin?
I only have one.

86
00:08:11,367 --> 00:08:12,992
Yes, I do.

87
00:08:34,223 --> 00:08:36,099
You go first.

88
00:08:57,079 --> 00:09:00,957
I'm suddenly thinking of those essays
my dad's students write.

89
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,542
What about them?

90
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:06,713
He read us some great ones
last night over dinner.

91
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:11,342
They're just kids. They had
to describe their favorite animals.

92
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:14,846
One little girl of eight
chose a bird.

93
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:17,724
How did it go?

94
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:21,018
"A bird is an animal
with an inside and an outside.

95
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:23,521
Take away the outside
and the inside is left.

96
00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:27,275
Take away the inside
and you see its soul."

97
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:45,126
THE RECORD SHOP - 2,000 FRANCS -
NANA LIVES HER LIFE

98
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:56,596
No, we're out of that, sir.

99
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:03,895
What about Judy Garland?

100
00:10:05,773 --> 00:10:07,940
We don't have her either.

101
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:15,615
Do you have a guitar recording
by Roméo...

102
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:19,494
What's his name?
Rafael Romero.

103
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:22,538
I'll ask.

104
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:28,044
Rafael Romero on guitar.

105
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,546
In the bins in back.

106
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,699
Is Rita still sick?

107
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:01,494
Yes. I think she'll be back
Thursday.

108
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:03,996
What a drag.
She owes me 2,000 francs.

109
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:11,963
- Can you lend me 2,000?
- You crazy? I'm broke.

110
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:16,092
Why? Anything wrong?
- No, nothing.

111
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,677
Here it is.

112
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:20,388
I'll take this too.

113
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:41,409
This way, sir.

114
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:25,036
That looks great.

115
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:28,956
The story's stupid,
but it's very well written.

116
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:33,461
"He gazed at the turquoise,
star-laden sky

117
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:35,588
and then turned to me.

118
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:39,050
'You live your life intensely,
so logically... '

119
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:40,718
I interrupted him.

120
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:43,930
'You attach
too much importance to logic.'

121
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:49,143
For a few seconds I was filled
with a bitter sense of triumph.

122
00:12:49,311 --> 00:12:52,939
No more broken heart,
no more struggle to live again.

123
00:12:53,065 --> 00:12:56,984
No probing questions to face
while masking one's defeat.

124
00:12:57,152 --> 00:13:00,863
Yes, a truly elegant way
of breaking this deadlock."

THE CONCIERGE - PAUL -

126
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:16,420
THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC -
A JOURNALIST

127
00:13:42,531 --> 00:13:44,573
Please give me my key.

128
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:47,702
All right, then.

129
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:54,000
Arthur! Get her!

130
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:00,381
Come on, give me the key.

131
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,680
Here, honey.

132
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:13,686
Hi.

133
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:16,105
Where are you headed?

134
00:14:16,273 --> 00:14:18,274
Want to see the pictures?

135
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:30,536
He doesn't look like me at all.
He looks more like you.

136
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:33,039
Come have dinner?

137
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:37,585
- Where are you going?
- Boulevard Saint-Michel.

138
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:40,337
- Come have dinner.
- I'm not hungry.

139
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:43,174
I want to see a movie.
Bye.

140
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,263
JOAN OF ARC

141
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:23,714
We have come
to prepare you for death!

142
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,438
Now... already?

143
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:51,283
How am I to die?

144
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:57,832
At the stake!

145
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:15,975
How can you still believe
you were sent by God?

146
00:16:20,856 --> 00:16:26,694
God knows our path, but we understand it
only at the end of the road!

147
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:40,040
Yes, I am his child!

148
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,011
And the great victory?

149
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:01,562
It will be my martyrdom!

150
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:03,856
And your deliverance?

151
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:15,367
Death!

152
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:32,259
Death.

153
00:17:41,478 --> 00:17:43,479
I said good-bye already.

154
00:17:43,647 --> 00:17:45,439
I paid for your movie ticket.

155
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:47,274
Too bad.

156
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:58,744
Evening. How are you?

157
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:00,579
Evening. How are things?

158
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:03,832
- Didn't we have a date tonight?
- Yes.

159
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:07,670
I wondered if you were coming.
- Why? Am I late?

160
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:11,590
Just a bit.
But that's not why I wondered.

161
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:14,760
I'm usually very punctual.

162
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:18,639
11:00 p.m. is very late.

163
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:25,896
I thought you'd forgotten too.

164
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:28,649
What will you have?

165
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:31,318
- Any rolls left?
- Sorry, no.

166
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:33,279
A coffee, then.

167
00:18:35,907 --> 00:18:38,742
Was that a friend outside?

168
00:18:38,994 --> 00:18:41,120
No, it was my brother.

169
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,872
You have lots
of brothers and sisters?

170
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,917
Five brothers and three sisters.

171
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:50,254
Surprised? It's true.

172
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:55,301
What's new since Wednesday?

173
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:58,012
Nothing much.

174
00:18:59,014 --> 00:19:01,724
Is that red car outside yours?

175
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,810
What is it? A Jaguar?

176
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:09,481
No, an Alfa Romeo.
Are you interested in cars?

177
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:12,818
No, I don't know
a thing about them.

178
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:17,823
When shall we take
those pictures?

179
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:21,994
You tell me.
I already told you I'm ready.

180
00:19:22,537 --> 00:19:24,747
But I'm only free on Sundays.

181
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:28,625
I'm off to London on Sunday.

182
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,045
Well then, I don't know.

183
00:19:33,548 --> 00:19:36,842
How about now?
Are you tired?

184
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:41,388
If I say no,
you won't think I'm awful?

185
00:19:41,556 --> 00:19:43,599
Not at all.

186
00:19:45,477 --> 00:19:48,604
Do you really think
I could get into films?

187
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:50,230
I think so.

188
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:53,525
Look, I brought you
a composite sheet.

189
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:05,788
I'd like to do
something like that.

190
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:09,208
What's this for?

191
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:12,920
You send it out
to people in films,

192
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:16,882
and a few days later
maybe they call you.

193
00:20:19,177 --> 00:20:21,845
I'm a bit shy
about undressing.

194
00:20:22,013 --> 00:20:24,598
Just a little.
What can it hurt?

195
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:29,603
Could you lend me 2,000 francs?

196
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:32,064
I would, but I haven't got it.

197
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,526
I'm tired.

198
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,533
What about my pictures?

199
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:45,536
You'll come with me then?

200
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:08,934
THE POLICE -
NANA IS QUESTIONED

201
00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:15,357
Nana Klein-what?

202
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:21,321
K-L-E-I-N...

203
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:28,495
F-R-A-N-K-E-N...

204
00:21:28,663 --> 00:21:31,623
H-E-I-M.

205
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:38,338
Born April 15th, 1940,
at Flexburg, Moselle.

206
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:41,216
No fixed address.
ls that right?

207
00:21:41,676 --> 00:21:43,135
Yes.

208
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:45,804
All right. What happened?

209
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:49,975
Well, I was walking
down the street,

210
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:53,061
and I saw a woman
buying a magazine.

211
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:58,567
Then... she took some money
out of her bag.

212
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:02,988
She didn't notice
she'd dropped 1,000 francs.

213
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:09,661
So then... I pretended
to buy a magazine too,

214
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:13,499
and I put my foot
on her 1,000 francs.

215
00:22:15,585 --> 00:22:18,337
She left and...

216
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:27,221
And she realized it?

217
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:40,526
She walked back toward me...

218
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:44,363
and stared into my eyes
for a long time.

219
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:50,410
So I gave her back her money.

220
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:01,380
Then why did she bring charges?

221
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:05,676
I don't know.
I think it was very mean of her.

222
00:23:14,352 --> 00:23:17,312
Don't you have anyone
you can stay with in Paris?

223
00:23:18,356 --> 00:23:20,440
Friends, sometimes.

224
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:23,277
Boys?

225
00:23:26,281 --> 00:23:28,031
Sometimes.

226
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:34,705
Why not ask
for an advance at work?

227
00:23:35,832 --> 00:23:38,417
I already have, too many times.

228
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:43,380
What are you going to do?

229
00:23:43,715 --> 00:23:45,382
I don't know.

230
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:47,301
I...

231
00:23:48,428 --> 00:23:50,846
I... is someone else.

232
00:23:56,060 --> 00:24:02,941
THE BOULEVARDS -
THE FIRST MAN - THE ROOM

233
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:10,717
How about it?

234
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:24,481
Is this the place?

235
00:25:25,108 --> 00:25:27,234
You've been here before?

236
00:25:28,069 --> 00:25:29,903
Yes, it is.

237
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:47,587
Anyone there?

238
00:25:47,797 --> 00:25:49,881
You want Room 27 or 28?

239
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:53,552
Room 27.

240
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,462
- Do you smoke?
- No, thanks.

241
00:27:15,927 --> 00:27:17,928
There's never an ashtray.

242
00:27:19,931 --> 00:27:21,723
Here's one.

243
00:27:33,945 --> 00:27:35,862
How much do you want?

244
00:27:37,448 --> 00:27:40,158
I don't know.
It's up to you.

245
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:44,871
I don't know.

246
00:27:46,249 --> 00:27:47,999
Four thousand francs?

247
00:28:05,977 --> 00:28:07,853
You owe me 1,000.

248
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,813
I have no change.

249
00:28:10,731 --> 00:28:13,441
Keep it.
It doesn't matter.

250
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:16,570
It's true.
I'm not just trying to get more.

251
00:28:17,363 --> 00:28:19,739
But you have
to take everything off.

252
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:30,750
Why not on the mouth?

253
00:28:41,304 --> 00:28:44,598
MEETING YVETTE -
A CAFÉ IN THE SUBURBS -

254
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:48,226
RAOUL -
GUNSHOTS IN THE STREET

255
00:29:04,452 --> 00:29:06,494
Yvette! How are you?

256
00:29:06,621 --> 00:29:09,497
Is that you? You cut your hair!
- A long time ago.

257
00:29:09,624 --> 00:29:11,082
- How are you?
- And you?

258
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,543
- Oh, I'm getting by.
- Me too.

259
00:29:13,711 --> 00:29:14,753
Good for you.

260
00:29:14,921 --> 00:29:17,672
- Why?
- I thought that...

261
00:29:18,215 --> 00:29:21,176
What are you doing here?

262
00:29:21,344 --> 00:29:23,386
I'm thirsty.
Shall we get a drink?

263
00:29:23,554 --> 00:29:25,013
I'd love to.

264
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:28,058
How's Raymond?

265
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:30,769
Oh, I'll tell you all about it.

266
00:29:30,937 --> 00:29:33,229
What happened?

267
00:29:34,357 --> 00:29:36,191
Life is cruel.

268
00:29:36,317 --> 00:29:41,446
I'd like to get away,
escape to the tropics.

269
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:44,282
- Escape is a pipe dream.
- Why?

270
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:46,368
It just is.

271
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:50,246
This is it.

272
00:29:55,962 --> 00:29:58,088
Shall we sit over there?

273
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:09,641
I'll be back in a minute.

274
00:30:27,785 --> 00:30:29,494
So tell me.

275
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:32,205
One evening, Raymond...

276
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,336
came home
with train tickets to Brest.

277
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:42,173
He said he had a job,
so we took the kids and moved

278
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:46,094
and went to live
in a hotel by the harbor.

279
00:30:47,513 --> 00:30:50,724
He'd disappear
for the entire day.

280
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:53,184
He was "working."

281
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:57,188
I'd take the children out,
buy them ice cream.

282
00:30:58,024 --> 00:31:00,984
I was worried,

283
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:04,696
because I couldn't figure out
how he earned his money.

284
00:31:04,864 --> 00:31:09,284
One evening,
after three weeks of that,

285
00:31:10,244 --> 00:31:12,620
he just never came back.

286
00:31:13,122 --> 00:31:15,707
I had to manage on my own...

287
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:19,919
with the children that
my mother-in-law wouldn't look after

288
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:22,213
because she didn't like me.

289
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:27,886
I gradually became a prostitute.
It was the easiest way.

290
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:36,102
Then, two years later,
I went to the movies one night...

291
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:41,483
and saw him acting
in an American movie.

292
00:31:43,069 --> 00:31:44,652
And things are fine now?

293
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,404
Everything's fine.

294
00:31:46,572 --> 00:31:48,239
What would you like?

295
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:50,700
- White wine.
- Rosé.

296
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:55,080
Still, it doesn't sound
like much fun.

297
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:58,541
No, it's depressing,
but it's not my fault.

298
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:06,424
I think we're always responsible
for our actions. We're free.

299
00:32:07,218 --> 00:32:10,178
I raise my hand -
I'm responsible.

300
00:32:11,097 --> 00:32:14,974
I turn my head to the right -
I'm responsible.

301
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:20,313
I'm unhappy -
I'm responsible.

302
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,943
I smoke a cigarette -
I'm responsible.

303
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:30,031
I shut my eyes -
I'm responsible.

304
00:32:32,118 --> 00:32:35,245
I forget that I'm responsible,
but I am.

305
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:39,916
I told you
escape is a pipe dream.

306
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:43,128
After all,
everything is beautiful.

307
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:47,090
You only have to take an interest
in things, see their beauty.

308
00:32:50,094 --> 00:32:51,678
It's true.

309
00:32:51,846 --> 00:32:54,973
After all,
things are just what they are.

310
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:58,143
A face is a face.

311
00:32:58,978 --> 00:33:00,979
Plates are plates.

312
00:33:01,147 --> 00:33:03,148
Men are men.

313
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:07,068
And life... is life.

314
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:17,537
The guy I said hello to by the door
wants to meet you.

315
00:33:17,663 --> 00:33:18,913
Would you mind?

316
00:33:19,081 --> 00:33:20,582
Not at all.

317
00:33:38,475 --> 00:33:41,019
My girl's not the kind
to be seen

318
00:33:41,187 --> 00:33:43,396
In a chic magazine

319
00:33:43,564 --> 00:33:45,440
That's plain to see

320
00:33:45,608 --> 00:33:48,234
No starlet's
sunglasses or gowns

321
00:33:48,402 --> 00:33:50,612
She works across town

322
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:52,530
In a factory

323
00:33:52,698 --> 00:33:55,366
Some plain furnished rooms
are our home

324
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:57,619
We live there alone

325
00:33:57,912 --> 00:33:59,746
She and I

326
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:02,582
A warehouse
and rooftops below

327
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:05,293
From our little window

328
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:07,337
Meet the eye

329
00:34:07,588 --> 00:34:09,964
Vacations we spend
close at hand

330
00:34:10,132 --> 00:34:12,425
The Riviera's too grand

331
00:34:12,593 --> 00:34:14,219
For our pay

332
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:17,055
Loved ones are distant and few

333
00:34:17,223 --> 00:34:19,641
I've a godmother who

334
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:22,143
Lives far away

335
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:24,562
But my girl, though just 25

336
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:26,981
ls the sweetest that I've

337
00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:29,067
Ever seen

338
00:34:29,235 --> 00:34:31,819
No saint in any church
you could find

339
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:34,280
ls as sweet or as kind

340
00:34:34,448 --> 00:34:36,199
At least to me

341
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:39,285
When the town dozes off
in the blaze

342
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:41,746
Of the sun's summer rays

343
00:34:41,914 --> 00:34:43,706
Burning bright

344
00:34:43,874 --> 00:34:46,417
With my baby girl
wrapped in my arms

345
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:49,003
I drink in her charms

346
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:50,880
And hold her tight

347
00:34:51,048 --> 00:34:53,675
We whisper our thoughts, she and I

348
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:56,344
As light fades from the sky

349
00:34:56,512 --> 00:34:58,263
Up above

350
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,932
In the secrecy of our four walls

351
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,476
As night slowly falls

352
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:05,061
We make love

353
00:35:13,112 --> 00:35:15,363
ls she a lady or a tramp?

354
00:35:17,908 --> 00:35:20,910
Insult her. if she's a tramp,
she'll get angry.

355
00:35:21,078 --> 00:35:23,121
If she smiles, she's a lady.

356
00:35:23,289 --> 00:35:24,789
Raoul.

357
00:35:31,297 --> 00:35:32,964
A hot toddy.

358
00:35:37,136 --> 00:35:38,845
We'll find out.

359
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:49,480
You're a friend of Yvette's?

360
00:35:50,107 --> 00:35:51,482
That's right.

361
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:54,652
I know you very well.

362
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:57,530
- You're lying.
- I saw you three months ago.

363
00:35:57,698 --> 00:35:58,865
You're lying.

364
00:35:59,158 --> 00:36:03,161
A guy was showing you pictures
on Boulevard Saint-Germain.

365
00:36:03,329 --> 00:36:04,829
That's true.

366
00:36:05,456 --> 00:36:09,334
Then why did you deny it?
You say any old nonsense.

367
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:12,170
You're pathetic.

368
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:15,548
Why do you look at me like that?

369
00:36:15,966 --> 00:36:19,510
You look stupid,
and your hair looks awful.

370
00:36:25,601 --> 00:36:28,186
Wait here.
I need to talk to you.

371
00:37:10,229 --> 00:37:11,229
You okay?

372
00:37:11,397 --> 00:37:12,897
My eyes!

373
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:28,204
THE LETTER - RAOUL AGAIN -
THE CHAMPS-ELYSÉES

374
00:38:07,286 --> 00:38:13,916
Dear Madame, a friend who worked
for you gave me your address.

375
00:38:53,665 --> 00:39:00,505
I would like to come
and work for you.

376
00:39:12,392 --> 00:39:16,854
I am 22 years old.

377
00:39:31,745 --> 00:39:37,542
I think I am pretty.

378
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:49,387
My height is...

379
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:14,370
5'6...

380
00:40:25,257 --> 00:40:30,970
I have short hair...

381
00:40:53,619 --> 00:40:59,123
but it grows very quickly.

382
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:20,478
Enclosed is a picture and...

383
00:41:24,483 --> 00:41:26,192
Oh, it's you.

384
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:30,279
The classic letter.

385
00:41:32,658 --> 00:41:34,158
Yes, it's me.

386
00:41:36,536 --> 00:41:38,663
How did you know I was here?

387
00:41:38,789 --> 00:41:40,456
I followed you.

388
00:41:41,083 --> 00:41:44,960
I was in my car,
and I saw you come in here.

389
00:41:45,796 --> 00:41:48,339
You've got some nerve.

390
00:41:48,507 --> 00:41:51,217
No, you're very beautiful.

391
00:42:00,477 --> 00:42:03,062
You really skipped out quickly
the other day.

392
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:04,772
When?

393
00:42:04,898 --> 00:42:07,692
When that crook was shot
outside the café.

394
00:42:07,818 --> 00:42:10,152
You just vanished.

395
00:42:12,781 --> 00:42:16,784
I don't think they were crooks.
It was some political stuff.

396
00:42:17,994 --> 00:42:20,538
Really? I didn't know.

397
00:42:20,997 --> 00:42:24,834
In any case,
I didn't mean you aren't brave.

398
00:42:25,502 --> 00:42:28,045
I was just making conversation.

399
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:42,560
What do you think of me?

400
00:42:42,978 --> 00:42:44,228
Me?

401
00:42:44,396 --> 00:42:45,896
Yes, you.

402
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:50,526
I think there's
a lot of goodness inside you.

403
00:42:50,694 --> 00:42:52,862
What? A lot of what?

404
00:42:53,029 --> 00:42:57,324
There's a lot of goodness
in your eyes.

405
00:42:58,326 --> 00:43:01,412
Really?
I didn't understand.

406
00:43:01,747 --> 00:43:04,039
Anyway,
that's an odd thing to say.

407
00:43:04,207 --> 00:43:05,750
Why?

408
00:43:13,383 --> 00:43:19,346
I wasn't expecting a Catholic response.
What I meant was:

409
00:43:19,514 --> 00:43:22,767
Do you place me
in a special category of women?

410
00:43:31,193 --> 00:43:33,277
You like being special?

411
00:43:35,655 --> 00:43:37,156
Why?

412
00:43:38,116 --> 00:43:39,825
No reason.

413
00:43:40,494 --> 00:43:43,454
For me, there are
three types of girls:

414
00:43:47,042 --> 00:43:51,045
those with one expression,
those with two, and those with three.

415
00:43:57,969 --> 00:44:00,554
Did Yvette give you this address?

416
00:44:07,354 --> 00:44:09,480
Are you really serious about it?

417
00:44:09,648 --> 00:44:11,148
Why?

418
00:44:12,442 --> 00:44:14,985
I'd like to earn more money.

419
00:44:16,071 --> 00:44:18,823
I can help you earn
even more here in Paris.

420
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:21,659
Really? Fine with me.

421
00:44:34,714 --> 00:44:38,175
Why not try to get into movies?
You're a pretty girl.

422
00:44:38,343 --> 00:44:40,427
I did try.

423
00:44:40,846 --> 00:44:43,764
Two years ago,
I wanted to make it on the stage.

424
00:44:44,432 --> 00:44:47,518
I was in Pacifico
at the Châtelet.

425
00:44:48,353 --> 00:44:51,564
And I was in a film once
with Eddie Constantine.

426
00:44:52,482 --> 00:44:56,026
I'm telling you my life story.
How awful.

427
00:44:58,488 --> 00:45:01,699
No, it's not. I'm a friend.

428
00:45:03,618 --> 00:45:05,202
Give me a smile.

429
00:45:05,328 --> 00:45:07,705
No, I don't feel like it.

430
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,913
Shall I come with you?

431
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,716
When do I start?

432
00:46:01,301 --> 00:46:06,138
"When the city lights go on, the
streetwalkers' desperate rounds begin."

433
00:46:13,063 --> 00:46:19,944
AFTERNOONS - MONEY - SINKS -
PLEASURE - HOTELS

434
00:46:22,113 --> 00:46:24,281
What exactly do I do?

435
00:46:24,407 --> 00:46:28,160
The prostitute earns all she can
by trading on her charms

436
00:46:28,328 --> 00:46:32,498
to build up a good clientele and
establish the best working conditions.

437
00:46:35,126 --> 00:46:37,378
Does she have
to be beautiful?

438
00:46:37,545 --> 00:46:42,424
No, although beauty is an important
factor in a prostitute's career.

439
00:46:42,592 --> 00:46:47,846
It establishes her place in the hierarchy
and attracts the attention of the pimp,

440
00:46:48,014 --> 00:46:52,309
since her physical allure can be
a source of great profit.

441
00:46:53,061 --> 00:46:55,521
Does she have
to register somewhere?

442
00:46:55,647 --> 00:46:58,899
Before the law
of April 13th, 1946,

443
00:46:59,025 --> 00:47:01,777
prostitutes were subject to medical
and police surveillance.

444
00:47:01,945 --> 00:47:04,905
Under the new law,
only medical surveillance

445
00:47:05,031 --> 00:47:06,824
is now required.

446
00:47:06,992 --> 00:47:12,246
The 1946 law and Decree 2253
of November 5th, 1947,

447
00:47:12,372 --> 00:47:17,167
established the National Sanitary
Register for all women

448
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:20,295
shown by conclusive evidence

449
00:47:20,422 --> 00:47:23,799
to be engaged in prostitution.

450
00:47:24,509 --> 00:47:27,011
But what do I do?

451
00:47:27,178 --> 00:47:31,015
Regardless of the neighborhood,
the procedure is the same.

452
00:47:31,182 --> 00:47:34,101
By her dress,
attitude, and makeup,

453
00:47:34,227 --> 00:47:36,770
the prostitute indicates
her trade.

454
00:47:36,938 --> 00:47:38,939
Sometimes,
in defiance of the law,

455
00:47:39,107 --> 00:47:43,193
she gestures to the client
or propositions him outright.

456
00:47:44,237 --> 00:47:46,363
What do I charge?

457
00:47:46,531 --> 00:47:48,991
It can vary greatly,

458
00:47:49,117 --> 00:47:51,160
from 300 to 15,000 francs

459
00:47:51,327 --> 00:47:54,204
for an encounter lasting
from a few minutes to an hour

460
00:47:54,372 --> 00:47:56,081
called a "trick."

461
00:47:56,249 --> 00:48:00,210
An "overnight" ranges
from 5,000 to 50,000 francs.

462
00:48:00,712 --> 00:48:03,338
Can I go anywhere I like?

463
00:48:03,506 --> 00:48:07,217
Controls have been attempted.
In Paris, for instance

464
00:48:07,385 --> 00:48:10,179
a police regulation
of August 25th, 1958,

465
00:48:10,346 --> 00:48:15,267
forbids loitering
with intent to solicit

466
00:48:15,435 --> 00:48:19,188
during certain hours
in the Bois de Boulogne

467
00:48:19,314 --> 00:48:21,398
and around the Champs-Elysées.

468
00:48:21,566 --> 00:48:23,776
Do I keep a percentage?

469
00:48:23,985 --> 00:48:28,238
A daily "quota"
is agreed upon in advance.

470
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:31,075
Around the Champs-Elysées
and the Madeleine,

471
00:48:31,242 --> 00:48:33,243
it's 20,000
to 30,000 francs a day,

472
00:48:33,411 --> 00:48:35,621
paid at the end of the week.

473
00:48:36,081 --> 00:48:38,290
Do I have my own room?

474
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:43,212
Usually only the towels are changed
between tricks, not the sheets.

475
00:48:43,338 --> 00:48:46,882
Some hotels provide no blankets,
only a bottom sheet.

476
00:48:48,009 --> 00:48:49,593
What about the police?

477
00:48:49,761 --> 00:48:52,888
They conduct raids
and interrogations.

478
00:48:53,014 --> 00:48:56,183
Any woman in violation
of regulations

479
00:48:56,351 --> 00:48:59,853
can be detained in a clinic
as long as necessary

480
00:48:59,979 --> 00:49:01,897
for extensive testing.

481
00:49:03,608 --> 00:49:05,859
Can I have a drink
in a café?

482
00:49:06,027 --> 00:49:09,238
A prostitute who drinks heavily
earns very little.

483
00:49:09,405 --> 00:49:12,783
She's undesirable
because she creates a scene.

484
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:17,121
What if I get pregnant?

485
00:49:17,247 --> 00:49:20,791
One might think a prostitute
would seek an abortion at any cost.

486
00:49:20,959 --> 00:49:22,751
That's not the case.

487
00:49:22,919 --> 00:49:29,925
They do try to avoid pregnancy,
by chemical means or any other.

488
00:49:30,051 --> 00:49:33,804
But once pregnancy is confirmed,
abortions are rare.

489
00:49:35,557 --> 00:49:37,307
Must I accept anyone?

490
00:49:37,475 --> 00:49:42,980
The prostitute must always be
at the client's disposal.

491
00:49:43,106 --> 00:49:45,649
She must accept anyone
who pays.

492
00:49:45,817 --> 00:49:47,442
That man...

493
00:49:48,027 --> 00:49:50,154
that man...

494
00:49:54,868 --> 00:49:56,994
Are there clients every day?

495
00:49:57,162 --> 00:49:59,955
Lower-grade prostitutes

496
00:50:00,081 --> 00:50:03,167
average
five to eight clients a day,

497
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:06,044
earning 4,000 to 8,000 a day.

498
00:50:06,212 --> 00:50:09,506
However, some manage
exceptional turnover.

499
00:50:09,674 --> 00:50:14,178
Sixty clients is not unheard of
on Saturdays or holidays.

500
00:50:14,762 --> 00:50:21,685
A YOUNG MAN -- LUIGI -- NANA
WONDERS WHETHER SHE'S HAPPY

501
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:23,770
Do I get days off?

502
00:50:23,897 --> 00:50:27,149
Usually after the medical check.

503
00:50:27,317 --> 00:50:31,236
Her man usually takes her out,

504
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:34,448
often to see her child
in the country.

505
00:50:34,574 --> 00:50:37,534
Afterwards, they go out
to a restaurant or a movie.

506
00:50:41,706 --> 00:50:43,957
- Is Luigi here?
- Upstairs.

507
00:50:46,878 --> 00:50:48,378
I'll be five minutes.

508
00:50:48,546 --> 00:50:50,881
The movie already started anyway.

509
00:50:53,384 --> 00:50:55,010
A white wine.

510
00:51:07,899 --> 00:51:09,608
Got any Gauloises?

511
00:51:28,169 --> 00:51:30,921
- You have cigarettes?
- Yes. What kind?

512
00:51:31,089 --> 00:51:33,090
I was just wondering.

513
00:52:22,181 --> 00:52:25,392
- Got any cigarettes?
- They've got some downstairs.

514
00:52:33,901 --> 00:52:36,320
- How are you?
- So-so.

515
00:52:36,946 --> 00:52:38,488
What's wrong with her?

516
00:52:38,656 --> 00:52:40,824
We were supposed
to see a movie.

517
00:52:40,992 --> 00:52:42,826
I'll cheer you up.

518
00:52:52,462 --> 00:52:55,714
I'll do the kid
blowing up a balloon.

519
00:53:05,016 --> 00:53:08,518
He's got a balloon,
and he blows it up.

520
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:55,315
You ought to be my man.

521
00:53:55,566 --> 00:53:57,943
Happy now?
Will you let us talk?

522
00:57:31,949 --> 00:57:40,832
THE STREETS - A GUY -
HAPPINESS IS NO FUN

523
00:58:21,832 --> 00:58:25,085
Did you see inspector Fleytoux?
He bought a BMW.

524
00:58:57,576 --> 00:58:59,786
They could have provided chairs.

525
00:58:59,954 --> 00:59:02,038
It's always like that.

526
00:59:09,422 --> 00:59:10,755
How much?

527
00:59:10,923 --> 00:59:13,675
3,000.
5,000 if I undress.

528
00:59:15,636 --> 00:59:19,514
Can't you give me one more?
- I have to keep some.

529
00:59:20,641 --> 00:59:22,559
- One of these, then?
- It's all I've got.

530
00:59:22,727 --> 00:59:25,645
A little one.
It would be so nice.

531
00:59:28,733 --> 00:59:30,525
You come here often?

532
00:59:32,903 --> 00:59:35,113
But I've seen you before,
haven't I?

533
00:59:35,322 --> 00:59:36,823
Maybe.

534
00:59:40,077 --> 00:59:42,036
What's your name?

535
00:59:42,204 --> 00:59:43,830
Dimitri.

536
00:59:45,082 --> 00:59:46,708
Nice name.

537
00:59:49,128 --> 00:59:51,463
Yes, I'm fond of it.

538
00:59:52,089 --> 00:59:54,090
What line of work are you in?

539
00:59:54,258 --> 00:59:57,093
I shoot pictures for ads.

540
00:59:57,261 --> 00:59:59,137
You mean like in the movies?

541
00:59:59,305 --> 01:00:01,264
No, still pictures.

542
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:05,059
I was in a movie with
Eddie Constantine two months ago.

543
01:00:05,269 --> 01:00:08,146
No Pity.
Did you see it?

544
01:00:12,526 --> 01:00:16,446
You don't say much.
Are you the romantic type?

545
01:00:22,369 --> 01:00:25,288
If you give me more,
you can stay.

546
01:00:30,669 --> 01:00:32,879
That's what you want?

547
01:00:34,089 --> 01:00:35,715
I'll go see.

548
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:45,600
Never mind.

549
01:00:54,610 --> 01:00:56,653
- Are you leaving?
- Yes.

550
01:00:58,614 --> 01:01:02,492
- Can you spare five minutes?
- Ask Monique. She's in 41.

551
01:01:15,047 --> 01:01:17,799
- What's up?
- Nothing.

552
01:01:20,803 --> 01:01:23,012
The elevators never work.

553
01:01:24,473 --> 01:01:27,016
See you Tuesday
at the Olympia.

554
01:01:42,032 --> 01:01:43,825
- What are you doing?
- Going downstairs.

555
01:01:43,993 --> 01:01:46,870
- Can you spare a moment?
- How much?

556
01:01:47,037 --> 01:01:49,664
I don't know.
We can discuss it.

557
01:01:49,874 --> 01:01:51,332
All right.

558
01:01:51,458 --> 01:01:53,501
Room 45.

559
01:02:14,899 --> 01:02:17,191
Work it out with her.

560
01:02:23,657 --> 01:02:26,159
- All right?
- Yes.

561
01:02:32,082 --> 01:02:35,668
- What's your name?
- Elizabeth. Like the Queen of England.

562
01:02:38,631 --> 01:02:40,882
Shall I strip too?

563
01:02:41,050 --> 01:02:42,800
Actually, don't bother.

564
01:02:42,968 --> 01:02:45,219
So you don't need me any more?

565
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:47,347
I don't know.

566
01:02:56,565 --> 01:02:58,274
Like that.

567
01:03:12,289 --> 01:03:19,295
PLACE DU CHÂTELET - A STRANGER -
NANA, THE UNWITTING PHILOSOPHER

568
01:04:30,951 --> 01:04:33,369
Do you mind me looking?

569
01:04:36,707 --> 01:04:38,541
You look bored.

570
01:04:38,709 --> 01:04:40,168
Not at all.

571
01:04:42,504 --> 01:04:45,173
- What are you doing?
- Reading.

572
01:04:54,850 --> 01:04:56,809
Will you buy me a drink?

573
01:04:57,561 --> 01:04:59,270
If you like.

574
01:05:06,111 --> 01:05:07,987
Do you come here often?

575
01:05:08,155 --> 01:05:11,157
Occasionally.
Today I just happened by.

576
01:05:12,993 --> 01:05:14,994
Why are you reading?

577
01:05:15,162 --> 01:05:16,829
It's my job.

578
01:05:22,961 --> 01:05:24,921
It's funny.

579
01:05:25,047 --> 01:05:27,090
Suddenly I don't know what to say.

580
01:05:27,966 --> 01:05:30,009
It happens to me a lot.

581
01:05:30,469 --> 01:05:32,512
I know what I want to say.

582
01:05:32,679 --> 01:05:36,891
I think first about whether
they're the right words.

583
01:05:37,351 --> 01:05:42,230
But when the moment comes
to speak, I can't say it.

584
01:05:42,397 --> 01:05:44,774
Yes, of course.

585
01:05:45,442 --> 01:05:47,777
Have you read
The Three Musketeers?

586
01:05:47,945 --> 01:05:51,197
No, but I saw the movie. Why?

587
01:05:53,075 --> 01:05:57,286
Because in it, Porthos...

588
01:05:58,288 --> 01:06:01,499
Actually, this is from
Twenty Years Later.

589
01:06:01,667 --> 01:06:05,586
Porthos is tall, strong,
and a little dense.

590
01:06:06,588 --> 01:06:09,590
He's never had a thought in his life.

591
01:06:10,509 --> 01:06:15,805
He has to place a bomb
in a cellar to blow it up.

592
01:06:15,973 --> 01:06:17,890
He does it.

593
01:06:18,058 --> 01:06:22,478
He places the bomb, lights the fuse,
and starts to run away.

594
01:06:23,188 --> 01:06:26,107
But just then he begins to think.

595
01:06:27,317 --> 01:06:29,235
About what?

596
01:06:29,403 --> 01:06:33,489
How it's possible to put
one foot in front of the other.

597
01:06:33,657 --> 01:06:36,325
I'm sure that's happened to you.

598
01:06:37,995 --> 01:06:42,415
So he stops running.
He can't move forward.

599
01:06:45,669 --> 01:06:49,172
The bomb explodes,
and the cellar caves in around him.

600
01:06:49,339 --> 01:06:52,508
He holds it up
with his strong shoulders.

601
01:06:52,676 --> 01:06:57,430
But after a day or two,
he's crushed to death.

602
01:06:58,015 --> 01:07:00,600
So the first time he thought,
it killed him.

603
01:07:00,726 --> 01:07:03,477
Why do you tell me
things like that?

604
01:07:04,313 --> 01:07:07,231
No reason. Just to talk.

605
01:07:07,399 --> 01:07:09,901
Why must one always talk?

606
01:07:10,569 --> 01:07:14,780
I think one should often
just keep quiet, live in silence.

607
01:07:16,074 --> 01:07:19,410
The more one talks,
the less the words mean.

608
01:07:19,578 --> 01:07:22,705
Perhaps,
but can one do that?

609
01:07:24,374 --> 01:07:25,374
I don't know.

610
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:29,295
It's always struck me,
the fact we can't live without speaking.

611
01:07:34,051 --> 01:07:36,802
But it would be nice.

612
01:07:37,387 --> 01:07:40,723
Yes, it would be nice, wouldn't it?

613
01:07:41,725 --> 01:07:44,435
Sort of like we loved
one another more.

614
01:07:44,603 --> 01:07:47,730
But it's impossible.
No one's been able to.

615
01:07:47,856 --> 01:07:49,398
But why?

616
01:07:49,566 --> 01:07:52,735
Words should express
just what one wants to say.

617
01:07:53,403 --> 01:07:55,071
Do they betray us?

618
01:07:56,907 --> 01:07:59,075
Yes, but we betray them too.

619
01:07:59,243 --> 01:08:01,410
One should be able
to express oneself.

620
01:08:01,578 --> 01:08:03,955
We manage
to write things quite well.

621
01:08:04,122 --> 01:08:08,000
It's extraordinary
that someone like Plato

622
01:08:08,168 --> 01:08:12,088
can still be understood.
People really do understand him.

623
01:08:12,256 --> 01:08:16,133
Yet he wrote in Greek
2,500 years ago.

624
01:08:16,301 --> 01:08:21,472
No one really knows
the language, not exactly.

625
01:08:21,807 --> 01:08:26,185
Yet something gets through, so we
should be able to express ourselves.

626
01:08:27,729 --> 01:08:29,772
And we have to.

627
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:33,943
Why do we have to?
To understand each other?

628
01:08:38,615 --> 01:08:40,616
We must think,

629
01:08:41,118 --> 01:08:43,744
and for thought we need words.

630
01:08:43,912 --> 01:08:46,122
There's no other way to think.

631
01:08:46,290 --> 01:08:49,750
To communicate, one must speak.
That's our life.

632
01:08:49,918 --> 01:08:52,503
Yes, but at the same time,
it's very hard.

633
01:08:56,383 --> 01:08:59,635
Whereas I think
life should be easy.

634
01:09:03,307 --> 01:09:07,810
Your tale about the Three Musketeers
may be a very nice story,

635
01:09:08,186 --> 01:09:09,854
but it's terrible.

636
01:09:10,022 --> 01:09:12,773
Yes, but it's a pointer.

637
01:09:14,067 --> 01:09:15,818
I believe

638
01:09:16,737 --> 01:09:22,325
one learns to speak well only when
one has renounced life for a while.

639
01:09:22,492 --> 01:09:25,494
That's the price.
- So to speak is fatal?

640
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:29,999
Speaking is almost
a resurrection in relation to life.

641
01:09:30,167 --> 01:09:34,337
Speaking is a different life
from when one does not speak.

642
01:09:34,504 --> 01:09:37,798
So to live speaking,

643
01:09:38,342 --> 01:09:41,969
one must pass through
the death of life without speaking.

644
01:09:42,095 --> 01:09:44,972
I don't know if I'm being clear...

645
01:09:46,516 --> 01:09:51,187
but there's a kind of ascetic rule
that stops one from speaking well

646
01:09:51,813 --> 01:09:55,024
until one sees life with detachment.

647
01:09:57,361 --> 01:10:03,115
But one can't live everyday life
with... I don't know...

648
01:10:04,159 --> 01:10:05,910
Detachment?

649
01:10:06,078 --> 01:10:10,664
We go back and forth. That's why
we pass from silence to words.

650
01:10:11,249 --> 01:10:16,212
We swing between the two,
because it's the movement of life.

651
01:10:16,630 --> 01:10:20,716
From everyday life
one rises to a life...

652
01:10:20,884 --> 01:10:25,429
Let's call it superior... why not?
It's the thinking life.

653
01:10:25,597 --> 01:10:29,517
But the thinking life presupposes
that one has killed off

654
01:10:29,684 --> 01:10:32,812
a life that's too mundane,
too rudimentary.

655
01:10:34,648 --> 01:10:38,442
Then thinking and speaking
are the same thing?

656
01:10:38,735 --> 01:10:40,528
I believe so.

657
01:10:40,695 --> 01:10:44,281
It's in Plato, you know.
It's an old idea.

658
01:10:44,449 --> 01:10:48,244
I don't think
one can distinguish a thought

659
01:10:48,412 --> 01:10:50,871
from the words that express it.

660
01:10:50,997 --> 01:10:57,086
A moment of thought can only
be grasped through words.

661
01:10:57,254 --> 01:10:59,880
So to speak is to risk lying?

662
01:11:00,048 --> 01:11:02,967
Lies too are part of our quest.

663
01:11:03,135 --> 01:11:06,429
There's little difference
between an error and a lie.

664
01:11:06,596 --> 01:11:11,183
I don't mean ordinary lies,
like promising,

665
01:11:11,351 --> 01:11:15,771
"I'll be here tomorrow at 5:00,"
and then not showing up.

666
01:11:15,939 --> 01:11:17,982
Those are just ploys.

667
01:11:18,150 --> 01:11:24,488
But a subtle lie
often differs little from an error.

668
01:11:24,656 --> 01:11:28,617
One's searching for something
and can't find the right word.

669
01:11:28,785 --> 01:11:33,080
That's why you didn't know
what to say before.

670
01:11:33,248 --> 01:11:37,126
I think you were afraid
of not finding the right word.

671
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:43,382
How can one be sure
of having found the right word?

672
01:11:45,844 --> 01:11:49,555
One must work at it.
It only comes with effort.

673
01:11:49,723 --> 01:11:54,268
To say what must be said
in the appropriate way,

674
01:11:54,394 --> 01:11:56,520
that is, that doesn't hurt,

675
01:11:56,646 --> 01:12:00,107
that says what must be said,
does what must be done,

676
01:12:00,233 --> 01:12:02,776
without hurting
or wounding anyone.

677
01:12:04,321 --> 01:12:07,615
One must try to act in good faith.

678
01:12:09,075 --> 01:12:10,993
Someone once told me,

679
01:12:11,161 --> 01:12:14,997
"There's truth in everything,
even in error."

680
01:12:15,957 --> 01:12:17,249
It's true.

681
01:12:17,417 --> 01:12:21,337
That's what France didn't see
in the 17th century.

682
01:12:21,505 --> 01:12:26,133
They thought one could
avoid errors and lies,

683
01:12:26,301 --> 01:12:29,470
that one could live
directly in the truth.

684
01:12:29,638 --> 01:12:31,347
I don't think it's possible.

685
01:12:31,515 --> 01:12:34,642
Hence Kant, Hegel,
German philosophy:

686
01:12:34,809 --> 01:12:37,603
to bring us back to life

687
01:12:37,771 --> 01:12:42,983
and make us see that we must pass
through error to arrive at truth.

688
01:12:46,530 --> 01:12:48,864
What do you think about love?

689
01:12:51,576 --> 01:12:55,246
The body had to come into it,

690
01:12:55,413 --> 01:12:58,165
and indeed,
Leibniz introduced the contingent.

691
01:12:58,333 --> 01:13:02,711
Contingent truths
and necessary truths make up life.

692
01:13:02,879 --> 01:13:06,882
German philosophy
showed us that in life,

693
01:13:07,050 --> 01:13:11,095
one thinks with the constraints
and errors of life.

694
01:13:11,263 --> 01:13:14,557
One must manage with that.
It's true.

695
01:13:16,685 --> 01:13:20,312
Shouldn't love be the only truth?

696
01:13:22,232 --> 01:13:26,026
But for that,
love would always have to be true.

697
01:13:26,194 --> 01:13:30,239
Do you know anyone who knows
right off what he loves?

698
01:13:31,366 --> 01:13:34,326
No. When you're 20,
you don't know.

699
01:13:34,494 --> 01:13:38,581
All you know are bits and pieces.
You grasp at experience.

700
01:13:38,748 --> 01:13:42,334
At that age, "I love"
is a mixture of many things.

701
01:13:42,502 --> 01:13:48,549
To be completely at one
with what you love takes maturity.

702
01:13:48,717 --> 01:13:50,884
That means searching.

703
01:13:51,052 --> 01:13:53,137
That's the truth of life.

704
01:13:54,723 --> 01:13:57,266
That's why love is a solution,

705
01:13:57,434 --> 01:14:00,644
but on the condition that it be true.

706
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:10,321
THE YOUNG MAN AGAIN -- THE OVAL
PORTRAIT -- RAOUL TRADES NANA

707
01:14:20,415 --> 01:14:22,291
What shall we do today?

708
01:14:23,084 --> 01:14:24,376
I don't know.

709
01:14:24,502 --> 01:14:26,795
Shall we go
to the Luxembourg Garden?

710
01:14:29,591 --> 01:14:32,468
I think it's going to rain.

711
01:14:34,512 --> 01:14:38,766
"I thus saw in vivid light
a picture all unnoticed before.

712
01:14:39,726 --> 01:14:43,937
It was the portrait of a young girl
just ripening into womanhood.

713
01:14:44,147 --> 01:14:48,609
I glanced at the painting hurriedly,
and then closed my eyes.

714
01:14:57,494 --> 01:15:01,372
It was an impulsive movement
to gain time for thought,

715
01:15:02,165 --> 01:15:05,209
to make sure that my vision
had not deceived me,

716
01:15:05,377 --> 01:15:10,339
to calm and subdue my fancy
for a more sober and more certain gaze.

717
01:15:11,007 --> 01:15:15,511
In a very few moments
I again looked fixedly at the painting.

718
01:15:21,726 --> 01:15:25,938
The portrait, I have already said,
was that of a young girl.

719
01:15:27,065 --> 01:15:29,942
It was a mere head and shoulders,

720
01:15:30,110 --> 01:15:34,238
done in what is technically
termed a vignette manner,

721
01:15:34,864 --> 01:15:38,701
much in the style
of the favorite heads of Sully.

722
01:15:38,993 --> 01:15:43,205
The arms, the bosom,
and even the ends of the radiant hair

723
01:15:43,373 --> 01:15:47,459
melted imperceptibly
into the vague yet deep shadow

724
01:15:47,627 --> 01:15:49,920
which formed
the background of the whole.

725
01:15:51,089 --> 01:15:54,174
As a thing of art,
nothing could be more admirable

726
01:15:54,342 --> 01:15:56,593
than the painting itself.

727
01:15:57,262 --> 01:16:00,639
But it could have been
neither the execution of the work,

728
01:16:00,807 --> 01:16:02,891
nor the immortal beauty
of the countenance,

729
01:16:03,059 --> 01:16:06,520
which had so suddenly
and so vehemently moved me.

730
01:16:06,688 --> 01:16:11,066
Least of all could it have been that
my fancy, shaken from its half slumber,

731
01:16:11,234 --> 01:16:14,361
had mistaken the head
for that of a living person.

732
01:16:18,241 --> 01:16:22,327
At length, satisfied
with the true secret of its effect,

733
01:16:22,495 --> 01:16:25,080
I fell back within the bed.

734
01:16:25,248 --> 01:16:28,083
I had found the spell of the picture

735
01:16:28,251 --> 01:16:33,422
in an absolute life-likeliness
of expression."

736
01:16:33,757 --> 01:16:35,466
ls that your book?

737
01:16:35,633 --> 01:16:37,634
No, I found it here.

738
01:16:43,808 --> 01:16:45,642
Can I have one?

739
01:16:54,778 --> 01:16:59,364
It's our story:
a painter portraying his love.

740
01:17:00,074 --> 01:17:01,742
Shall I go on?

741
01:17:04,788 --> 01:17:08,999
"And in sooth
some who beheld the portrait

742
01:17:09,125 --> 01:17:12,961
spoke of its resemblance
in low words as of a mighty marvel,

743
01:17:13,129 --> 01:17:16,298
and a proof not less
of the power of the painter

744
01:17:16,466 --> 01:17:20,969
than of his deep love for her
whom he depicted so surpassingly well.

745
01:17:21,221 --> 01:17:25,474
But at length, as the labor drew
nearer to its conclusion,

746
01:17:25,642 --> 01:17:28,143
there were admitted none
into the turret.

747
01:17:28,311 --> 01:17:31,396
For the painter had grown wild
with the ardor of his work,

748
01:17:31,564 --> 01:17:37,027
and turned his eyes from the canvas
rarely, even to regard his wife.

749
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:41,114
And he would not see that the tints
which he spread upon the canvas

750
01:17:41,282 --> 01:17:45,369
were drawn from the cheeks of her
who sat beside him.

751
01:17:45,829 --> 01:17:50,916
And when many weeks had passed,
and but little remained to do,

752
01:17:51,167 --> 01:17:55,128
save one brush upon the mouth
and one tint upon the eye,

753
01:17:55,296 --> 01:17:59,550
the spirit of the lady again flickered up
as the flame within a lamp.

754
01:18:00,009 --> 01:18:04,388
And then the brush was given,
and then the tint was placed.

755
01:18:05,098 --> 01:18:08,100
And, for one moment,
the painter stood entranced

756
01:18:08,268 --> 01:18:10,769
before the work he had wrought.

757
01:18:10,937 --> 01:18:14,106
But in the next, while he yet gazed,

758
01:18:14,274 --> 01:18:16,984
he grew tremulous and aghast,

759
01:18:17,110 --> 01:18:21,363
and crying with a loud voice,
"This is indeed Life itself!"

760
01:18:21,531 --> 01:18:24,867
turned suddenly to regard his beloved:

761
01:18:25,410 --> 01:18:27,035
She was dead!"

762
01:18:36,170 --> 01:18:38,547
I'd like to go to the Louvre.

763
01:18:38,882 --> 01:18:41,800
No, I don't like looking at pictures.

764
01:18:45,096 --> 01:18:48,473
Why? Art and beauty are life!

765
01:18:52,228 --> 01:18:53,645
I adore you.

766
01:18:54,063 --> 01:18:55,439
And I love you.

767
01:19:03,698 --> 01:19:06,074
Why not come and live with me?

768
01:19:06,534 --> 01:19:08,911
Yes. I'll tell Raoul it's all over.

769
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:20,213
Let me at least put my coat on
or I'll catch cold!

770
01:19:20,340 --> 01:19:22,299
Stop acting hysterical.

771
01:19:29,682 --> 01:19:31,058
No, Raoul, not now!

772
01:19:31,225 --> 01:19:33,185
Stop acting hysterical!

773
01:19:33,645 --> 01:19:35,562
You know each other?

774
01:19:51,955 --> 01:19:53,956
What did I do wrong?

775
01:19:55,083 --> 01:19:57,167
You must take anyone who pays.

776
01:19:57,335 --> 01:20:00,879
Not anyone.
Sometimes it's degrading.

777
01:20:01,673 --> 01:20:03,799
See? That's where you're wrong.

778
01:20:11,224 --> 01:20:15,477
The movies are a drag.
Weekdays we're too busy,

779
01:20:15,645 --> 01:20:18,146
and on Sundays
there's always a line.

780
01:20:21,234 --> 01:20:24,653
- Where are you going?
- Taking them back to their car.

781
01:20:24,821 --> 01:20:27,322
Why did you make me come?

782
01:20:27,865 --> 01:20:29,866
You're going with them.

783
01:20:31,327 --> 01:20:34,329
HADES AND SONS

784
01:21:37,518 --> 01:21:39,352
Well, are you going?

785
01:21:54,827 --> 01:21:56,578
First the girl.

786
01:22:06,255 --> 01:22:07,756
First the money.

787
01:22:12,386 --> 01:22:14,221
Get the money.

788
01:22:47,296 --> 01:22:49,339
There's 100,000 missing.

789
01:22:49,674 --> 01:22:51,258
Don't move.

790
01:22:51,425 --> 01:22:53,718
Don't think I won't shoot
just because of the girl.

791
01:22:53,886 --> 01:22:55,679
No, don't shoot me!

792
01:22:58,641 --> 01:23:01,434
You shoot.
I forgot to load.

793
01:23:02,305 --> 01:23:08,644
