DIGITALLY RESTORED IN 2015

3
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:54,173
SHAME

4
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,922
You know...

5
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:46,508
I had the strangest dream
last night.

6
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,600
Know what I dreamed?

7
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:52,688
We were back with the philharmonic,
sitting side by side,

8
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:56,059
rehearsing the fourth
Brandenburg Concerto, the Largo.

9
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:01,360
And everything happening now
was behind us, like a bad dream.

10
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,701
I woke up crying.

11
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:08,906
I'd started crying
while we were playing.

12
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,666
It was the slow movement.

13
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:13,747
You know the one...

14
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:24,087
Aren't you going
to shave today either?

15
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,963
If you insist.

16
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:33,388
- Why are you in a bad mood?
- I'm not.

17
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:36,357
You're always
in a foul mood these days.

18
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:39,148
Go get dressed
or we'll miss the ferry.

19
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,192
We have to be
at the mayor's by 9:00.

20
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:47,077
That's hardly my fault.
I didn't start this damned war.

21
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,791
Listen...

22
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:58,747
maybe we could afford
a bottle of wine?

23
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:01,962
What do you say, Eva?

24
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,472
You're so silly.

25
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:11,933
Go get dressed.

26
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:14,596
I think I'm getting a wisdom tooth.

27
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:19,020
Is that dentist still around?
- We'll find out.

28
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,812
Wisdom teeth can be nasty.

29
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:24,480
I had one up here on the right.

30
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:27,321
The dentist had to extract it
piece by piece.

31
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:29,318
Took a whole day.

32
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,495
No anesthetic either.

33
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,498
I had a fever
for weeks afterwards.

34
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:39,878
I hope this one isn't as bad.
That would be nice.

35
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,298
Can you see anything?

36
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:46,423
No, not a thing.

37
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:49,176
Feel here. It feels swollen.

38
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:51,173
And there's a lump.

39
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:01,435
I guess we'd better hurry.

40
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,730
Did you pay the phone bill?

41
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:07,653
Shit! I forgot.

42
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:12,278
But why pay for something
that never works anyway?

43
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:15,206
They'd better fix the darn thing...

44
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,043
or I shouldn't have to pay.

45
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:22,580
- We have to have a phone.
- Of course.

46
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,670
But we don't get a lot of orders.

47
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:29,261
With no phone
we might as well pack it all in.

48
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:33,224
People could call the Olssons,
and we could pay them.

49
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:40,101
You hear the church bells?

50
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,143
Is it a holiday?

51
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,778
No, just an ordinary Friday.

52
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:50,362
What could it mean?
- Nothing. Hurry up, now.

53
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:53,820
It's ominous hearing church bells
on an ordinary day.

54
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,206
What time is it?
- Five past 6:00.

55
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:59,515
I think it's going to rain.
Go get your leather jacket.

56
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:39,141
Oh, for God's sake!

57
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:45,689
Jan?

58
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,735
What is it now?

59
00:08:57,579 --> 00:08:59,536
You mustn't be so sensitive.

60
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,530
I can't take it.

61
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:06,878
Try to control yourself. I do.

62
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,880
Can't you ever shut up?

63
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,886
I'm sorry.

64
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:24,937
I forgot my jacket after all.

65
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:43,201
There sure have been
a lot of transports lately.

66
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:47,668
I didn't mean to be nasty.
It just happened.

67
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:50,584
Don't worry.
I give as good as I get.

68
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,889
You know what?

69
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:14,566
Tomorrow it will be four years
since we moved to this island.

70
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:18,065
And Grandpa died
a year ago yesterday.

71
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:21,698
We mustn't forget
to go put flowers on his grave.

72
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,469
Hi there, Filip!

73
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,853
What were you talking about?

74
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:40,231
He said the radio warned
of an impending invasion.

75
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,949
They've been saying that
for years.

76
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:47,033
- Our radio's always acting up!
- Not to mention the car.

77
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:50,954
If you didn't insist
on fixing things yourself...

78
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:58,249
It's better not to know anything.

79
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,876
God, your escapism drives me mad!

80
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,885
But I wasn't going to nag.

81
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:12,054
I got us some fish for dinner.
- That's good.

82
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:20,483
As you stood talking to Filip,
I felt really in love with you.

83
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:22,572
You looked so beautiful.

84
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,487
From a distance, right?

85
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,130
Good morning.

86
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:31,472
We were just coming to see you!

87
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:33,389
Really? Nice to see you.

88
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,934
We have some berries for you.

89
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,181
Morning.

90
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:41,311
We have lingonberries for you.
- Hello, Mrs. Rosenberg.

91
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:46,152
We just went out to check
on the summer cottage.

92
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:50,824
I was just telling the mayor we have
delicious lingonberries for you.

93
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:54,699
I'm afraid we're not
headed home just now...

94
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:59,044
- We'll drop them at your place.
- Sure it's no bother?

95
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:00,913
No bother at all.

96
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:04,338
- Is anyone at home?
- Miss Almberg should be there.

97
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:09,346
Why don't we get together for dinner
and make some music together

98
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,802
like in the old days?

99
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:14,510
I've missed our soirees.

100
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,511
We both have.

101
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:21,024
Ever since our conductor,
Mr. Kreisler, was drafted.

102
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:23,527
Mayor, may I ask you something?

103
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:27,364
Are these troop movements
significant?

104
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,401
The situation has become
more critical lately.

105
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,949
You hear so much on the radio...

106
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:35,289
Our radio's always broken!

107
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,909
I think you have
to hope for the best.

108
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:42,629
You never know what's in store.

109
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:46,046
My sister was evacuated
to a transit camp,

110
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,802
and they're bombed almost daily.

111
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:52,219
I think we're almost there.
We better say good-bye.

112
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:57,391
It would be great to see you.
- Give us a call.

113
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:59,309
Good-bye.

114
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:03,400
Give our best to your son.
- Thank you. We will.

115
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:57,538
- Can we go in the main entrance?
- Of course.

116
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,453
They gave us an extra ten kronor!

117
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:02,622
Let's get some wine at Fredrik's.

118
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,804
I guess he's out.

119
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:58,890
He never goes out.

120
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:02,060
Hi!

121
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,521
Have you been drafted too?

122
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:07,353
Yeah, just look at this getup.

123
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:11,229
And I haven't handled
a weapon in over 20 years.

124
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:13,397
Have a seat.

125
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:16,992
And I have no one
to look after the shop either.

126
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,452
Not that it makes
much difference.

127
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,948
How can I help you?
- We'd like a bottle of wine.

128
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:26,043
I have a few bottles left.

129
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:28,955
Listen, I want
to show you something.

130
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,714
You have to see this.

131
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:41,307
- Look at that!
- The finest piece I own.

132
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:45,726
- An antique, right?
- Meissen, 18th century.

133
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:50,310
- Where did you get it?
- My mother left it to me.

134
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:52,648
I'll never sell it.

135
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:55,731
Listen to that.

136
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:57,858
I'll be right back.

137
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:39,817
- Do you listen to the radio?
- No, ours never works.

138
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,786
I can't seem to fix it.

139
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:46,327
Yesterday our side
threatened to take

140
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,826
the most atrocious measures.

141
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,749
And today
the other side congratulated us

142
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:54,123
on our imminent destruction.

143
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,504
We've heard it all before.

144
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:59,344
I suspect we needn't
take it too seriously.

145
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,634
Wait a minute!

146
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,804
Taste this. It's quite good.

147
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,262
But we came to buy a bottle.

148
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:10,980
It's not bad at all.

149
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:13,809
Cheers.

150
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:24,244
- That's delicious.
- It really is.

151
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,454
May I have a look?

152
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:29,700
- I have just five bottles left.
- Look at that.

153
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:32,040
From 1959.

154
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:35,293
- Could we really afford a bottle?
- Sure.

155
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,008
Cheers.

156
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:53,315
You know, sometimes
when I sit here all alone

157
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,354
among my things...

158
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,944
I start feeling so miserable.

159
00:19:58,072 --> 00:20:00,029
I'm not sure why.

160
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:04,447
Maybe because no one
would miss me if I were gone.

161
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,912
Not even Mrs. Prins.
- Mrs. Prins?

162
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,157
The lady who cleans for me.

163
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:14,252
Once a week she cleans the place
and makes coffee...

164
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:17,122
and we sleep together.

165
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:22,636
No, Mrs. Prins
won't particularly miss me.

166
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,548
You'll be back before you know it.

167
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:29,013
How much for a bottle?

168
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:33,560
For you, ten kronor.
I'd give it to you...

169
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,357
but I need the money.

170
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:39,061
To pay Mrs. Prins, in fact.

171
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:43,740
She's going to look
after my things while I'm gone.

172
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:50,956
Well, we have to catch the ferry.

173
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:55,915
You know, I have a bad foot.

174
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,796
You think they'll take that
into account

175
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:02,042
and give me
an administrative job?

176
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:04,044
Of course they will.

177
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:07,423
They didn't want me at all!
- Enough about you.

178
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,683
You have to show good faith

179
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:13,144
and not hide behind
a doctor's certificate.

180
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:17,812
But you have to tell them.
Maybe they'll send you home.

181
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,560
Thanks so much.

182
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:23,313
- See you soon.
- I hope so.

183
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:27,074
Well, good-bye.

184
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:29,695
Thank you. Good-bye.

185
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:42,500
I think we should drink
to Filip and his fish.

186
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:47,300
- And my cooking.
- And your cooking.

187
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:08,984
By the way,
the radio's working again.

188
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:12,074
- You fixed it?
- Yes, finally.

189
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:14,163
- Aren't you clever!
- I am, huh?

190
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:17,326
- When you want to be.
- I'm always clever.

191
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:20,954
Know what I'm going to do?
I'm pretty clever too.

192
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,831
I know you are.

193
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:26,297
- Take up Italian again.
- Finally!

194
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:29,136
- Starting tonight.
- You've talked about it for ages.

195
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:31,131
But I need your help.

196
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:34,305
You have to tell me
every night to study.

197
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:38,430
I'll time you and quiz you,
and I'll be very strict.

198
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:41,517
You know what else
we should do every morning?

199
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:45,654
Right after feeding the chickens,
we should practice our instruments.

200
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:48,865
You, that early?
This I'll have to see!

201
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:52,527
I swear I will!
A half hour every day.

202
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:55,989
We have our instruments
and tons of sheet music.

203
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:58,242
We have to keep up our skills.

204
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,369
Jan, I want children.

205
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:04,043
I really want to have children.
- Right now?

206
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:08,176
- No, not quite yet.
- Why?

207
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,421
It's not something
one can explain.

208
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:13,139
Try.

209
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:16,681
It's this feeling that...

210
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:19,850
Let's wait until things calm down.

211
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:22,232
No, I think this is important.

212
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:25,269
A lot of the problems
between us

213
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:28,067
might be because
we don't have kids.

214
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:31,362
Me being a woman
and not having kids.

215
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:34,995
I'd like to have kids before I'm 30.

216
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:37,785
You can wait till 40.

217
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:40,250
No, the younger, the better.

218
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:44,208
By 40 I want three kids.
We'll be a family.

219
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:47,962
Listen, this is serious,
what I have to say.

220
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:52,132
You mustn't get upset.
- I won't.

221
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,803
The next time we go into town,

222
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:59,102
I want us to go to a doctor...

223
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,762
Why?

224
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:05,313
...and get a checkup,
since I never seem to get pregnant.

225
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,561
I'm perfectly healthy.

226
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:10,564
So am I. We both are.

227
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:13,734
It's probably just your nerves.
- I mean it.

228
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:17,783
I want us to go
so you can get a checkup.

229
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:20,452
Don't take it personally.

230
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:24,411
That time we separated
for a while...

231
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:27,622
You were up to all sorts of stuff.

232
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,336
I didn't do anything.

233
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:32,711
That could be
why we don't get pregnant.

234
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:35,259
Because you had
lots of other women.

235
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:38,475
I did not.
Why bring that up?

236
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:42,183
It meant nothing.
You're the one I've always loved.

237
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:45,603
- What about that opera singer?
- She meant nothing.

238
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:49,398
It was just that one time.
I've always loved you.

239
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:53,149
I've always loved you.
I love you right now.

240
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:56,785
I'm not sure
you know what love is.

241
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:58,528
I certainly do.

242
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,078
Self-love.
You know a lot about that.

243
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:05,877
I'm not as selfish as you think.

244
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:08,213
I think you're very selfish.

245
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:11,587
I'll be a better man next year.
Next week!

246
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:14,336
- Is that right?
- I promise.

247
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:18,348
I believe one can change
completely if one wants to.

248
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:21,010
- You?
- Yes.

249
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:23,679
I'm not a determinist, you know.

250
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,932
- A what?
- A determinist.

251
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,400
What's a determinist?

252
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:34,572
A determinist is a person who...

253
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:41,576
Never mind.
Just so you fix the sink tomorrow.

254
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,246
Let's not do the dishes now.

255
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:50,247
No? What should we do instead?

256
00:27:20,097 --> 00:27:23,306
- Where are you going?
- He'll die hanging up there!

257
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:25,846
- It could be the enemy.
- You coward!

258
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:29,142
- Stay here. You're not going.
- He's caught in the trees!

259
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,146
You're not going...

260
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:34,688
Then go!

261
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:04,847
I'll go call an ambulance!

262
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:33,202
- Did one or two men bail out?
- We only saw one. Right?

263
00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:36,375
- Did you shoot the pilot?
- Was I supposed to?

264
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:39,629
No, I guess it wasn't you.

265
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:41,919
I suggest you clear out.

266
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:45,551
They dropped paratroopers
just half a mile from here.

267
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:20,131
I know what we'll do.

268
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:24,720
I'll put it in gear, and you push.
It's downhill anyway.

269
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:26,633
What are you doing?

270
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:37,189
Hurry up! Come on!

271
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:21,017
- You shot the pilot, didn't you?
- No, I didn't!

272
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:25,153
Lying will only make it worse.

273
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:27,657
He was dying when we got there.

274
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:30,819
Isn't that right?
- Yes!

275
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:33,079
Have other soldiers been here?

276
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:36,074
Yes, about 30 minutes ago.

277
00:30:36,293 --> 00:30:39,001
They warned us
that you'd landed nearby.

278
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:42,539
They were in two jeeps,
about 14 of them.

279
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:46,585
They told us to clear out
and headed for the shore.

280
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,677
Just calm down.

281
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:51,635
Breathe! Don't be afraid.

282
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:55,347
Is that mic and camera ready?
Come on.

283
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:59,314
We'll just chat a bit
for the folks at home.

284
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:01,725
Why are you resisting?

285
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:07,356
We want to show the folks
what sort of people we've liberated.

286
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,192
Camera.

287
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:16,414
"Voices of the Liberation 78."
Hand me the mic.

288
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,537
Your name?

289
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,500
Speak up. Don't be afraid.

290
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:25,707
Eva Rosenberg.

291
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,876
Tell us about yourself.

292
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:31,213
I'm 28.

293
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:37,056
I'm first violinist
in the philharmonic.

294
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,684
Jan and I have been married
for seven years.

295
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:44,560
We've lived here
since the orchestra was disbanded.

296
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:48,396
Tell us more.

297
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:50,444
There isn't any more.

298
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:54,614
What's your political affiliation?

299
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:58,577
- I don't have one.
- No political affiliation?

300
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,458
I don't really have the time,

301
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:04,078
and our radio's broken.

302
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:09,001
Don't you care
what political regime governs you?

303
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:11,128
It's not that.

304
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:16,133
It's just that the war has gone on
so long that it's hard to...

305
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:18,385
- So you're not indifferent?
- No!

306
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,603
- You've taken a stand?
- Yes.

307
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,889
Good. Excellent.

308
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:24,898
And your name?

309
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:28,269
I'm not feeling well.
I have a weak heart.

310
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:32,274
He isn't well.
Jan, wait a minute.

311
00:32:33,994 --> 00:32:36,361
Keep rolling!
Get him passing out.

312
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:51,672
Come on.

313
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:55,964
Quick, Jan.

314
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:58,303
Let's get inside.

315
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:02,599
Help me out here.

316
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:06,808
Please help me, Jan.

317
00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:59,406
You know what I was thinking
the whole time?

318
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:00,870
No.

319
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,372
It's good we don't have kids.

320
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:10,921
We'll have kids when peace comes.

321
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:14,543
We'll never have kids.

322
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:44,622
Jan, grab your boots and let's go!

323
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,741
We have to hurry.

324
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:48,913
Come on!

325
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:09,647
- We'll head for the shore.
- Fine. As long as you drive.

326
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,061
Hurry!

327
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:15,231
- What about food?
- I didn't have time to cook!

328
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:18,192
Let's take the chickens.

329
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:21,238
- Who's going to wring their necks?
- Not me!

330
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:22,780
We'll shoot them.

331
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,820
You ever hear
of shooting chickens?

332
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:28,040
- I refuse to wring their necks.
- Fine, shoot them!

333
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:30,535
Do whatever you want.

334
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:37,174
Not me!

335
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:41,970
It's still standing there.

336
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:44,806
Shoot the damned thing!
- I can't do it.

337
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:47,138
I'm so sick of you!

338
00:37:39,883 --> 00:37:40,883
Eva, come!

339
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:17,160
We have to head back!

340
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:20,458
Jan, drive us home!

341
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,258
Pull yourself together!

342
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:24,184
It sounds like...

343
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:28,860
It's sounds like
they're at the crossroads.

344
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:37,706
This god-awful noise!
I can't stand it!

345
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:40,042
I can't take it anymore!

346
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:10,231
Maybe we'd be safer
in the basement.

347
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,900
I won't be trapped like a rat!

348
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:51,567
Did I ever tell you about Pampini?

349
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:53,102
No.

350
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,567
He was a contemporary
of Beethoven's.

351
00:42:56,866 --> 00:42:58,983
He made instruments in Vienna.

352
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:01,235
Trained in the Italian school.

353
00:43:03,206 --> 00:43:07,371
He served in the Russian army
and fought Napoleon for many years.

354
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:11,628
Then he lost a leg
and went back to making violins.

355
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:15,040
This one was made in 1814,

356
00:43:15,176 --> 00:43:17,418
same year
as the Congress of Vienna.

357
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:20,213
He died of cholera.

358
00:43:20,348 --> 00:43:22,180
I forget what year.

359
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:34,438
My hand is ruined.

360
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:37,901
You want to try?

361
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,008
Do you care for me a little?

362
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:03,297
Yes, I care for you a little.

363
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:07,638
Do you love me?

364
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:14,315
Do you?

365
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:17,778
Sure, I love you.

366
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:23,650
What is it?

367
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:27,370
What's wrong?
- I got a cramp.

368
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:35,287
There.

369
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:38,957
It's letting up.

370
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:45,631
Hang on.

371
00:45:02,158 --> 00:45:03,569
Jan.

372
00:45:04,911 --> 00:45:06,447
Get over here.

373
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:15,053
Stop right there.

374
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:19,107
- I have to close up the store.
- Hurry up!

375
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,232
I'm Filip Olsson.

376
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:47,604
Take them inside.

377
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:49,231
Move it!

378
00:47:53,621 --> 00:47:55,533
Everyone inside!

379
00:48:08,636 --> 00:48:10,468
Sit them down over there.

380
00:48:24,777 --> 00:48:27,190
Would you like to sit together?

381
00:48:33,369 --> 00:48:36,112
- My name's Oswald.
- Rosenberg.

382
00:48:36,247 --> 00:48:40,412
We've met, actually.
The charity concert a few years back.

383
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:42,416
Of course.

384
00:48:42,837 --> 00:48:45,329
I'm a teacher... or I was.

385
00:48:47,675 --> 00:48:49,257
It doesn't look good.

386
00:49:01,814 --> 00:49:03,430
You know...

387
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:06,938
sometimes this is all like a dream.

388
00:49:07,278 --> 00:49:08,894
Not my own.

389
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:12,147
Someone else's dream
that I'm forced to be in.

390
00:49:12,283 --> 00:49:16,197
What happens when they wake up
and feel ashamed about all this?

391
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:18,945
Jan and Eva Rosenberg.

392
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:40,975
I see.

393
00:49:53,491 --> 00:49:56,279
We have reason to believe
you've collaborated

394
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:58,447
with the other side.

395
00:49:58,579 --> 00:50:02,118
The most serious evidence
is Mrs. Rosenberg's TV interview

396
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:06,243
in which she endorses
the political views of the enemy.

397
00:50:06,378 --> 00:50:09,337
- That's not true.
- Not true?

398
00:50:09,632 --> 00:50:12,670
We happen to have
a copy of the interview.

399
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:14,838
Would you care to see it?

400
00:50:15,638 --> 00:50:17,129
Lights out.

401
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:22,472
<i>We've been oppressed
for far too long.</i>

402
00:50:23,187 --> 00:50:27,022
<i>We've longed for liberation
like those thirsting in the desert.</i>

403
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:30,108
<i>I wish your troops victory.</i>

404
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:35,022
That wasn't my voice!
I never said that.

405
00:50:36,534 --> 00:50:38,400
Tell the truth now,

406
00:50:38,536 --> 00:50:40,994
or you and your husband will pay!

407
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:43,450
We never collaborated.

408
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:48,494
How do you explain the fact
that paratroopers liquidated

409
00:50:48,629 --> 00:50:51,622
every civilian
within almost two square miles

410
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:54,420
yet spared the two of you?

411
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,342
I don't know.

412
00:50:56,554 --> 00:50:58,716
I don't understand any of this.

413
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:03,387
Take her out.
I want to speak to him alone.

414
00:51:08,232 --> 00:51:10,565
No! Let me go!

415
00:51:37,261 --> 00:51:39,878
Hello again, Mrs. Rosenberg.

416
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:52,269
Sit down.

417
00:51:52,401 --> 00:51:54,518
What did they do to you?

418
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:57,437
Let me see.

419
00:52:00,284 --> 00:52:02,822
Doctor, please.

420
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:10,082
Can you stand up?

421
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:16,832
Nothing wrong with you.
Your limbs are intact.

422
00:52:22,765 --> 00:52:25,257
You look dreadful. Stand up.

423
00:52:30,064 --> 00:52:32,602
He'll have to go to the hospital.

424
00:52:39,907 --> 00:52:43,150
What about you?
How are you doing?

425
00:52:44,662 --> 00:52:46,745
Your shoulder's been dislocated.

426
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:50,365
Give me a hand.
We'll pop it back in place.

427
00:52:51,043 --> 00:52:53,000
No, don't!

428
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:07,261
No tennis for a few weeks.

429
00:53:10,938 --> 00:53:13,601
What do we have here?
Is he asleep?

430
00:53:14,775 --> 00:53:17,859
Take him away.
He can't lie here rotting.

431
00:53:25,786 --> 00:53:28,119
Have they fed you at all?
- No.

432
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:33,200
Sorry about that.
We're not yet properly organized.

433
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,702
I'll have them send in some food.

434
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:38,462
And the lady?
Is anything ailing her?

435
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:40,707
Nothing? Good.

436
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:42,633
Cigarette?

437
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:46,008
Good evening.

438
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:52,556
Was the man they carried out dead?
Who was that?

439
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:56,890
- The editor of the local paper.
- Really?

440
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:03,188
A false rumor went around saying
the invasion had been a success.

441
00:54:04,742 --> 00:54:07,576
So they made up a front page
welcoming the liberation forces.

442
00:54:08,996 --> 00:54:12,364
- What about you, Vicar?
- They treated me humanely.

443
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:15,082
They let me go
once I started screaming.

444
00:54:15,294 --> 00:54:17,536
Almost as if
they were embarrassed.

445
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:20,505
Well, they certainly beat me!

446
00:54:20,632 --> 00:54:25,423
They hit me on the head.
- Where? I don't see anything.

447
00:54:25,596 --> 00:54:27,838
The gray-haired guy said...

448
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:31,053
"This is for that TV segment."

449
00:54:32,144 --> 00:54:34,386
<i>How many are in here?</i>

450
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:38,022
Oh, there are three of you.

451
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:45,108
I'll be back with one more.

452
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:09,504
- Need some help?
- No, I'm fine.

453
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,472
I'll hold it.

454
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:15,598
- I'm just a bit stiff.
- I can imagine.

455
00:55:15,896 --> 00:55:17,853
That's fine, thanks.

456
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:20,310
It looked painful.

457
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:23,309
I'm fine.

458
00:55:23,904 --> 00:55:25,395
Does it hurt?

459
00:55:25,614 --> 00:55:28,197
It's more of a throbbing now.

460
00:55:29,243 --> 00:55:31,155
Report to the courtyard!

461
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:31,173
Fall in!

462
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:34,214
Order arms!

463
00:56:34,725 --> 00:56:36,387
Fall in!

464
00:56:36,727 --> 00:56:38,218
Hurry up!

465
00:57:05,589 --> 00:57:08,206
This man collaborated
with the enemy

466
00:57:08,342 --> 00:57:10,425
and caused us heavy losses.

467
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:13,594
But the government
has pardoned him

468
00:57:13,764 --> 00:57:17,508
and commuted his death sentence
to life at hard labor.

469
00:57:26,026 --> 00:57:30,896
The rest of you will also receive
more leniency than you deserve.

470
00:57:31,615 --> 00:57:34,073
Some of you
will be freed immediately

471
00:57:34,201 --> 00:57:36,318
and transported home.

472
00:58:09,778 --> 00:58:11,986
Take these two to my office.

473
00:58:32,551 --> 00:58:34,713
May we please sit down?

474
00:58:34,845 --> 00:58:36,052
Hell no.

475
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:39,172
If Jacobi saw you,
he'd have my hide.

476
00:58:47,691 --> 00:58:49,774
What will happen now?

477
00:59:07,753 --> 00:59:09,415
Come inside.

478
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:17,460
Have a seat.

479
00:59:18,055 --> 00:59:20,547
I heard about
the infamous interview.

480
00:59:20,724 --> 00:59:23,057
We knew it was a complete fake...

481
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:27,891
but they needed someone
to make an example of.

482
00:59:28,023 --> 00:59:30,766
Are you all right?
No serious injuries?

483
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:33,647
I gave orders not to touch you.

484
00:59:33,779 --> 00:59:37,398
- They behaved... almost correctly.
- That's something at least.

485
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:46,364
I hope we'll meet again soon
and have a chance to talk.

486
00:59:47,334 --> 00:59:49,667
Where the hell are those drivers?

487
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:52,453
I assume
you're anxious to get home.

488
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:57,425
Things better shape up
around here come Monday!

489
00:59:59,471 --> 01:00:02,805
I'm trying to get a car
to spare you the jeep.

490
01:00:02,933 --> 01:00:07,303
Jacobi here.
Please send a car here at once.

491
01:00:08,355 --> 01:00:11,974
Peters, make sure they get home
as quickly as possible.

492
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:14,442
Good-bye.

493
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:29,012
I'm sick of this.
You keep on if you want.

494
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:33,972
Playing the martyr, huh?

495
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:37,316
All sanctimonious
and full of hate.

496
01:01:38,862 --> 01:01:41,855
It's funny.
As long as there was a war,

497
01:01:42,032 --> 01:01:44,399
we were relatively decent
to each other.

498
01:01:45,577 --> 01:01:47,819
I'm going in to hear the news.

499
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:51,038
You do that.
It'll be a relief not to see you.

500
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:54,705
Jacobi gave us that radio
and said it was important...

501
01:01:54,878 --> 01:01:58,542
Then go listen to the damn thing
if it's so important!

502
01:02:04,054 --> 01:02:05,761
Just the other day...

503
01:02:05,889 --> 01:02:09,553
you said it was good
we had Jacobi as a friend.

504
01:02:09,684 --> 01:02:12,222
- I said no such thing.
- You did too.

505
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:15,729
You were just too drunk
to remember it.

506
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:21,319
I'm going to ask Jacobi
to stop coming here.

507
01:02:21,446 --> 01:02:24,405
Filip says it could
make things worse for us.

508
01:02:24,532 --> 01:02:28,071
It's none of Filip's damn business
who comes here!

509
01:02:28,203 --> 01:02:31,116
- Well, you're such a suck-up!
- You should talk.

510
01:02:31,248 --> 01:02:32,830
I don't suck up.

511
01:02:32,958 --> 01:02:35,245
You do too.
You're a suck-up.

512
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:38,081
Don't you dare call me that!

513
01:02:38,922 --> 01:02:41,915
Suck-up, suck-up, suck-up!

514
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:48,133
When peace comes,
we're going our separate ways.

515
01:02:48,265 --> 01:02:52,600
It will be heaven to get away
from you and your childishness.

516
01:02:54,104 --> 01:02:57,438
You're not the only one
whose life has been ruined.

517
01:02:57,607 --> 01:03:00,020
There are other people
in this world!

518
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:02,435
Stop grinning like that!

519
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:05,062
You're not as remarkable
as you think!

520
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:19,376
I'm sorry.

521
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:24,624
You say that,
but you don't mean it.

522
01:03:24,843 --> 01:03:27,802
The words just fall
out of your mouth.

523
01:03:31,016 --> 01:03:33,053
Can't we be friends?

524
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:47,605
- What day of the week is it?
- I don't know.

525
01:03:47,741 --> 01:03:50,484
It's Saturday.
No, that was yesterday.

526
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:52,572
Today must be Sunday.

527
01:03:53,955 --> 01:03:55,662
What time is it?

528
01:03:59,002 --> 01:04:00,959
Must be that damned Jacobi.

529
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:16,346
Am I disturbing you?

530
01:04:17,312 --> 01:04:19,019
Not at all.

531
01:04:19,731 --> 01:04:22,644
I was on my way home
after a walk.

532
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:25,818
I thought I'd stop in,
if I'm not disturbing you.

533
01:04:25,945 --> 01:04:28,312
No, we're just listening
to the radio.

534
01:04:28,448 --> 01:04:30,110
My shoes are muddy.

535
01:04:30,241 --> 01:04:33,279
Might Jan have some slippers
I could borrow?

536
01:04:33,578 --> 01:04:37,572
These are soaking wet.
They should go by the fire.

537
01:04:38,166 --> 01:04:39,623
Jan!

538
01:04:39,834 --> 01:04:43,373
Jan Rosenberg,
where the hell are you?

539
01:04:44,172 --> 01:04:48,041
I brought you a present, Jan,
a damn fine one:

540
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:51,919
Dvorak's Trio in E-flat Major.

541
01:04:52,055 --> 01:04:56,220
An uncle left it to me.
- Thank you!

542
01:04:56,393 --> 01:04:59,306
Perhaps we'll play it
together one day.

543
01:04:59,437 --> 01:05:01,929
I have something
for you too, Eva.

544
01:05:03,108 --> 01:05:07,148
I hope it's the right size.
It's an old family heirloom.

545
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:10,900
You really mustn't give us so much!

546
01:05:20,417 --> 01:05:21,999
<i>Hello, Jan.</i>

547
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:23,951
Eva...

548
01:05:25,088 --> 01:05:26,670
talk to me.

549
01:05:27,632 --> 01:05:29,248
Say something.

550
01:05:30,718 --> 01:05:33,882
My dear Eva, don't be sad.

551
01:05:34,556 --> 01:05:36,092
Who was that?

552
01:05:36,266 --> 01:05:39,304
A neighbor who gives us fish
now and then.

553
01:05:39,436 --> 01:05:42,770
But I got the feeling...
- He's just a good friend.

554
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:44,931
He needed some kerosene.

555
01:05:45,108 --> 01:05:47,771
Thanks for that whole drum,
by the way.

556
01:05:48,069 --> 01:05:50,982
Those men are driven
by a terrible idealism.

557
01:05:51,114 --> 01:05:52,901
And you're not?

558
01:05:53,324 --> 01:05:55,611
Eva doesn't like me this evening.

559
01:05:55,743 --> 01:05:59,703
If I asked her for a kiss,
she'd claim it would bother you.

560
01:05:59,831 --> 01:06:01,743
But it wouldn't, would it?

561
01:06:01,875 --> 01:06:03,832
You'll have to ask her.

562
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:10,380
How about a kiss?

563
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:20,800
You're so nice.

564
01:06:22,729 --> 01:06:25,938
But you know you put us
in a difficult situation

565
01:06:26,065 --> 01:06:28,148
by coming here so often?

566
01:06:30,153 --> 01:06:31,644
I see.

567
01:06:33,114 --> 01:06:35,652
You're telling me
you don't want me here.

568
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:39,193
Don't get Eva wrong.
All she meant was...

569
01:06:39,329 --> 01:06:41,616
Too bad I happen
to like you two,

570
01:06:41,748 --> 01:06:44,365
that we became friends
in spite of everything.

571
01:06:44,501 --> 01:06:47,665
Otherwise I could have
sent you to a labor camp.

572
01:06:48,755 --> 01:06:52,169
Jan Rosenberg, are you afraid?
- No.

573
01:06:52,342 --> 01:06:56,131
- Are you an artist or a mouse?
- Oh, I'm a mouse...

574
01:07:03,144 --> 01:07:05,181
The sacred freedom of art.

575
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:07,680
The sacred gutlessness of art.

576
01:07:18,535 --> 01:07:20,652
I'm going out to take a piss.

577
01:07:29,754 --> 01:07:32,292
God, I wish I could sober up!

578
01:07:33,174 --> 01:07:35,131
That was too much.

579
01:07:37,845 --> 01:07:40,178
We have to get rid of him.

580
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:43,390
That was
a nasty moment with Filip.

581
01:07:45,478 --> 01:07:48,812
Did you know
that the woods are full of people?

582
01:07:59,242 --> 01:08:02,030
I've often wondered
what they'll do to me.

583
01:08:02,829 --> 01:08:05,367
The thought frightens me, I admit.

584
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:11,206
They have no reason to torture me.
I have no secret information.

585
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:15,297
But perhaps they just feel
like making me suffer.

586
01:08:15,592 --> 01:08:17,925
Don't worry. I'm just kidding.

587
01:08:18,052 --> 01:08:20,635
This part of the island
has been pacified.

588
01:08:25,268 --> 01:08:26,634
Eva...

589
01:08:27,353 --> 01:08:28,889
touch me.

590
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:30,771
No.

591
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:32,476
Touch my head.

592
01:08:35,153 --> 01:08:36,610
There.

593
01:08:36,821 --> 01:08:39,029
Can you feel that I'm here?

594
01:08:39,657 --> 01:08:41,273
Touch my eyes.

595
01:08:50,251 --> 01:08:51,708
Here.

596
01:08:52,170 --> 01:08:53,832
Put your hand here.

597
01:08:56,591 --> 01:08:58,833
Can you feel who I am?
- No.

598
01:08:59,761 --> 01:09:01,798
Jan, take my hands.

599
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:07,633
You feel who I am?
- Of course, but...

600
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:09,642
It's odd, you see.

601
01:09:10,021 --> 01:09:13,139
I've only felt close
to others a few times.

602
01:09:13,274 --> 01:09:15,266
Always in connection with pain.

603
01:09:15,943 --> 01:09:20,483
Is it the same for you two?
- No, it's not.

604
01:09:21,115 --> 01:09:23,653
It's not something
you can talk about.

605
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:27,494
There's nothing to say,
nowhere to hide.

606
01:09:28,539 --> 01:09:30,747
No excuses, no evasions.

607
01:09:32,043 --> 01:09:34,330
Just great guilt, great pain...

608
01:09:36,130 --> 01:09:37,792
and great fear.

609
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:43,469
Damn, it's cold.
- I think it's time you go home.

610
01:09:46,641 --> 01:09:50,009
I feel the change in weather
in my bad leg.

611
01:09:51,938 --> 01:09:54,305
Eva, come here.

612
01:09:55,441 --> 01:09:57,307
I have something for you.

613
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:11,280
Here's 23,000 kronor.
I want you to have my life savings.

614
01:10:11,416 --> 01:10:14,534
- I don't want your money.
- Don't be silly.

615
01:10:15,461 --> 01:10:17,703
We'll consider it an inheritance.

616
01:10:22,218 --> 01:10:23,880
My dear Eva...

617
01:10:24,595 --> 01:10:26,587
can I talk to you?

618
01:10:30,309 --> 01:10:34,178
I was at my son's place
a few days ago.

619
01:10:35,022 --> 01:10:36,934
He's on leave...

620
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:40,643
and he has
a little boy of 19 months.

621
01:10:40,987 --> 01:10:43,229
It was the boy's bedtime,

622
01:10:43,614 --> 01:10:47,233
and his daddy was feeding him
pap from a big cup.

623
01:10:47,994 --> 01:10:50,737
There he sat,
like a baby monkey,

624
01:10:50,997 --> 01:10:53,865
cuddled up
in his father's great big body.

625
01:10:56,043 --> 01:10:59,127
By the time he was full,
he was practically asleep.

626
01:11:00,298 --> 01:11:01,789
Eva?

627
01:11:03,426 --> 01:11:05,543
May I tell you something else?

628
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:11,882
My mother died a few years back.

629
01:11:12,435 --> 01:11:15,018
She was old and had a bad heart.

630
01:11:15,313 --> 01:11:18,897
I got a call one Sunday
saying she was very ill...

631
01:11:19,025 --> 01:11:20,937
so I went to see her.

632
01:11:22,236 --> 01:11:25,445
When I entered the living room,
the doctor approached me.

633
01:11:25,698 --> 01:11:29,487
I asked him,
"May I go in to see my mother?"

634
01:11:30,495 --> 01:11:32,111
He replied...

635
01:11:33,623 --> 01:11:35,831
"Your mother just passed away."

636
01:11:37,668 --> 01:11:42,629
I sat at her side for an hour,
looking at her.

637
01:11:46,093 --> 01:11:48,756
She had a bandage
on her index finger.

638
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:52,885
At times I thought
I could hear her breathing.

639
01:12:01,609 --> 01:12:04,226
There isn't much
that gets through.

640
01:12:06,489 --> 01:12:08,902
You know why I took this job?

641
01:12:09,116 --> 01:12:10,607
No.

642
01:12:10,910 --> 01:12:12,822
I was given a choice...

643
01:12:13,830 --> 01:12:16,868
and I was afraid
of going to the front.

644
01:12:18,292 --> 01:12:20,830
Do you regret your decision?

645
01:12:21,003 --> 01:12:22,494
No.

646
01:12:23,673 --> 01:12:26,416
I've never been unfaithful
to Jan before.

647
01:12:28,845 --> 01:12:31,508
Sometimes it frightens me
to think about it...

648
01:12:31,681 --> 01:12:33,843
so I don't.

649
01:12:35,726 --> 01:12:37,809
No, not here.

650
01:12:38,145 --> 01:12:39,636
Come with me.

651
01:12:47,113 --> 01:12:48,695
He's asleep.

652
01:16:35,549 --> 01:16:37,586
I'll get your cane.

653
01:16:53,109 --> 01:16:55,351
Cry if you think it will help.

654
01:17:18,134 --> 01:17:20,467
Where did that money come from?

655
01:17:36,277 --> 01:17:38,439
The yard's full of people.

656
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:08,969
We're going to have a talk.

657
01:18:13,063 --> 01:18:14,804
All right!

658
01:18:52,102 --> 01:18:53,889
Come in here a minute.

659
01:19:09,745 --> 01:19:12,533
We've talked things over.

660
01:19:13,457 --> 01:19:15,790
Filip says I can buy my freedom

661
01:19:15,918 --> 01:19:19,082
because their organization
needs cash.

662
01:19:20,339 --> 01:19:24,333
So I'm asking you, dear Eva:
Lend me the money I gave you.

663
01:19:25,594 --> 01:19:27,210
Jan has it.

664
01:19:27,429 --> 01:19:29,921
I don't know anything
about any money.

665
01:19:34,144 --> 01:19:37,603
- You didn't take it?
- I don't know what you mean.

666
01:19:37,982 --> 01:19:40,315
Tell your husband to hand it over.

667
01:19:40,442 --> 01:19:43,480
Go get the money if you hid it.

668
01:19:43,612 --> 01:19:45,695
It's not yours anyway.

669
01:19:46,365 --> 01:19:48,857
I don't know what you're talking about.

670
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:52,861
We'll have to search the place.

671
01:21:13,786 --> 01:21:15,402
Where's the money?

672
01:21:15,537 --> 01:21:18,200
I don't know
what you're talking about!

673
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:43,058
Let's blow the joint sky-high!

674
01:21:50,572 --> 01:21:52,029
Well?

675
01:25:01,346 --> 01:25:04,259
- Where did you hide the money?
- I didn't.

676
01:25:05,017 --> 01:25:06,178
Where is it?

677
01:26:02,032 --> 01:26:04,775
Why didn't you hand over
the money?

678
01:26:04,993 --> 01:26:07,906
- They'd have shot him anyway.
- That's not true.

679
01:26:10,957 --> 01:26:12,949
Stop it.

680
01:26:16,296 --> 01:26:17,503
Stop it!

681
01:27:04,970 --> 01:27:08,680
Don't shoot. We're not armed.

682
01:27:10,392 --> 01:27:12,179
Are you hungry?

683
01:27:13,228 --> 01:27:15,311
We'll feed you.

684
01:27:17,232 --> 01:27:18,723
Wait.

685
01:27:31,997 --> 01:27:33,738
Did you desert?

686
01:27:37,335 --> 01:27:39,418
Did you hurt your hand?

687
01:27:39,755 --> 01:27:41,542
A dog bit me.

688
01:27:41,923 --> 01:27:43,960
Shall I have a look?

689
01:27:49,931 --> 01:27:52,719
Come sit down. I'll bandage it up.

690
01:27:58,148 --> 01:28:00,811
Hang on.
I'll get you something to eat.

691
01:28:02,235 --> 01:28:03,817
Want some?

692
01:28:04,696 --> 01:28:06,779
Aren't you hungry?

693
01:28:17,751 --> 01:28:20,209
- What's your name?
- Johan.

694
01:28:22,756 --> 01:28:25,920
- Have you been hiding out long?
- A few weeks.

695
01:28:27,636 --> 01:28:30,629
- You have a bandage on you?
- In my pocket.

696
01:28:30,764 --> 01:28:32,426
I'll get it.

697
01:28:36,436 --> 01:28:38,143
Is Hammars far from here?

698
01:28:39,231 --> 01:28:42,599
- What will you do there?
- None of your business.

699
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:45,692
Are you tired?

700
01:28:45,821 --> 01:28:47,813
Want to get some sleep?

701
01:28:50,075 --> 01:28:51,987
Why did you run away?

702
01:28:52,786 --> 01:28:54,994
A bunch of us ran off together.

703
01:28:55,580 --> 01:28:58,163
I don't know
where the others went.

704
01:29:01,711 --> 01:29:03,668
Have something to drink.

705
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:17,217
I haven't slept in days.

706
01:29:25,277 --> 01:29:27,815
Tell us why
you're going to Hammars.

707
01:29:57,893 --> 01:29:59,429
Leave him alone.

708
01:29:59,561 --> 01:30:01,974
Let him sleep.

709
01:30:06,776 --> 01:30:08,893
No, leave me alone!

710
01:30:09,070 --> 01:30:10,902
Get up!

711
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:16,651
Get up!

712
01:30:16,870 --> 01:30:18,486
Leave me alone.

713
01:30:22,250 --> 01:30:23,707
Get up!

714
01:30:25,921 --> 01:30:28,664
Leave me alone!
Just let me go!

715
01:30:28,965 --> 01:30:30,831
Don't shoot!

716
01:30:32,344 --> 01:30:35,928
Just let me go!
You can have my shoes!

717
01:31:58,513 --> 01:32:00,345
What did you do with him?

718
01:32:02,851 --> 01:32:06,515
There's a fishing boat leaving
from Hammars tomorrow.

719
01:32:07,022 --> 01:32:11,312
A friend who'd paid to be on it
told him about it.

720
01:32:12,527 --> 01:32:15,110
That friend was shot
that same day.

721
01:32:16,114 --> 01:32:17,980
What did you do to him?

722
01:32:18,116 --> 01:32:21,700
These shoes will come in handy.
Mine are worn out.

723
01:32:24,873 --> 01:32:28,867
What did you do to him?

724
01:32:50,231 --> 01:32:52,063
I'm not going with you.

725
01:32:52,233 --> 01:32:54,020
Easier that way.

726
01:33:06,331 --> 01:33:09,415
Maybe we should bring some food.

727
01:33:54,504 --> 01:33:56,211
Jan?

728
01:34:03,847 --> 01:34:07,716
What will happen if we can never
talk to one another again?

729
01:34:08,768 --> 01:34:11,101
The boat's here.

730
01:34:47,724 --> 01:34:50,057
Is there room for me and Eva?

731
01:34:50,351 --> 01:34:52,058
It'll cost you.

732
01:34:52,729 --> 01:34:54,391
Will this do?

733
01:41:47,268 --> 01:41:49,260
I had a dream.

734
01:41:51,606 --> 01:41:54,599
I was walking
down a very beautiful street.

735
01:41:56,902 --> 01:42:00,987
On one side were white houses

736
01:42:01,115 --> 01:42:03,778
with towering arches and pillars.

737
01:42:05,494 --> 01:42:10,205
On the other side was a leafy park.

738
01:42:14,503 --> 01:42:19,498
Dark green water flowed
beneath the trees lining the street.

739
01:42:23,262 --> 01:42:25,720
I came to a high wall...

740
01:42:26,557 --> 01:42:29,265
overgrown with roses.

741
01:42:33,939 --> 01:42:37,808
Then an airplane came
and set the roses on fire.

742
01:42:39,820 --> 01:42:44,485
But it wasn't all that terrible,
because it was so beautiful.

743
01:42:46,452 --> 01:42:48,944
I looked down into the water

744
01:42:49,413 --> 01:42:51,996
and watched the roses burn.

745
01:42:55,127 --> 01:42:57,915
I held a baby in my arms.

746
01:42:58,464 --> 01:43:00,376
It was our daughter.

747
01:43:03,594 --> 01:43:06,007
She snuggled up to me...

748
01:43:07,473 --> 01:43:11,057
and I could feel her mouth...

749
01:43:12,061 --> 01:43:14,678
against my cheek.

750
01:43:17,274 --> 01:43:19,516
And the whole time I knew

751
01:43:19,902 --> 01:43:22,645
there was something
I should remember...

752
01:43:24,532 --> 01:43:26,899
something someone had said.

753
01:43:29,328 --> 01:43:31,866
But I'd forgotten what it was...

753
01:43:32,305 --> 01:44:32,528
