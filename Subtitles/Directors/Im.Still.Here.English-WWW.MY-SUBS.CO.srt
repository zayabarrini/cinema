00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:41,985
I'M STILL HERE

3
00:00:49,037 --> 00:00:54,460
DURING THE MILITARY DICTATORSHIP

4
00:01:16,518 --> 00:01:19,188
Go, Marcelo! Go.
It's doing well!

5
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:27,084
Great, Eliana!

6
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:32,358
Go, go!

7
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:38,806
Yeah!

8
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:41,307
That's great!

9
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:44,036
Let's go! Yes!
That's good, team!

10
00:01:48,117 --> 00:01:49,493
Whose cur is this?

11
00:01:50,311 --> 00:01:51,795
Guys, take him away.
Take the dog.

12
00:01:57,518 --> 00:01:58,685
Is he yours?

13
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:03,062
Marcelo!

14
00:02:05,275 --> 00:02:06,902
Hold him.
He's messing up the game.

15
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,355
- He is cute.
- Beautiful.

16
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,846
- You should stay with him.
- I cannot.

17
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:13,633
Hold on.

18
00:02:14,618 --> 00:02:17,579
Do you know what that 
boy’s name is? Ah, Marcelo!

19
00:02:19,164 --> 00:02:20,832
Look how cute our new puppy is.

20
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:23,544
Mom will not let him stay.
He's a flea-ridden.

21
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,869
- Where's she?
- I don't know.

22
00:02:26,213 --> 00:02:27,589
Give me some.

23
00:02:28,423 --> 00:02:31,176
She'll kill us if we get tanned
at the ballet, isn't, Nalu?

24
00:02:31,343 --> 00:02:33,053
That's why rice poweder is for.

25
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,560
Let's go, come on!

26
00:02:47,442 --> 00:02:49,236
Be careful on the street, Marcelo!

27
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,743
Let's go, let's go!

28
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,693
Excuse me, excuse me.

29
00:03:06,628 --> 00:03:08,088
Oh, no, guys.
Please, clean your feet.

30
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,230
I just swept the floor
of the house.

31
00:03:09,881 --> 00:03:11,883
He's cute. Let me hold it.

32
00:03:12,384 --> 00:03:14,052
- What does that mean, boy?
- Our new puppy.

33
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:17,744
A filhty dog, Marcelo.
Does your mom know about that?

34
00:03:18,265 --> 00:03:19,349
Is my Dad here?

35
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:22,991
In the office with Mr. Bocayuva.
Don't bother him, Marcelo.

36
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,520
- It's urgent.
- Wait... Don't go, Marcelo!

37
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:33,363
It was crazy that we accepted a
project of the size.

38
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:35,365
If it was easy we wouldn't
take it, would you?

39
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:38,432
- You would take it, I know you.
- Ah, I would take it.

40
00:03:39,202 --> 00:03:40,579
- Dad?
- Come in.

41
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:44,541
No, no, no.
Dog in the house, no.

42
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:48,128
- No, no way.
- Can we stay with him, please?

43
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,963
- What did your mother say?
- She said to ask you.

44
00:03:51,173 --> 00:03:53,116
What's this got to do with me?
Look at this.

45
00:03:54,593 --> 00:03:57,220
Can you take it with you?

46
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,362
Me? No way.

47
00:03:58,647 --> 00:04:01,241
I have a tunnel to build.
And Dalal will kick me out of house.

48
00:04:03,435 --> 00:04:06,240
I think this little rascal here.

49
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:09,233
Will be called...

50
00:04:10,525 --> 00:04:12,319
- Pimpão!
- Let me see it.

51
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:13,654
I know how do it.

52
00:05:16,925 --> 00:05:18,427
Wait, guys.

53
00:05:19,177 --> 00:05:20,178
What is this?

54
00:05:20,679 --> 00:05:21,680
Drop it. Hide it.

55
00:05:52,043 --> 00:05:56,381
- <i>Lean against the wall, I command.</i>
- <i>I've already given you my IDs.</i>

56
00:05:56,673 --> 00:05:58,266
- <i>What more do you want?</i>
- <i>Shut up!</i>

57
00:05:59,843 --> 00:06:01,803
You in the yellow car!

58
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,363
Park here.

59
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:06,725
Stop here, here.

60
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:10,819
<i>To wall, fuck!
Hand in the wall!</i>

61
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:13,315
Turn off the engine.

62
00:06:15,025 --> 00:06:16,651
Put that fucking camera down.

63
00:06:16,985 --> 00:06:20,030
Come on, get out of the car.

64
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:23,757
To the wall.

65
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,053
Put your hand on the hood.

66
00:06:26,077 --> 00:06:28,580
Let's go, hairy one, to the wall.

67
00:06:29,498 --> 00:06:32,292
- Shit, man! That's not necessary.
- Be quiet there, girl.

68
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:36,254
Turn around.

69
00:06:42,677 --> 00:06:44,638
Where are your IDs?

70
00:06:45,555 --> 00:06:47,599
- Wait, no need to push him.
- Be quiet!

71
00:06:48,058 --> 00:06:50,352
I'll get them, they're in the car.
Can I take them?

72
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:52,020
Move! Move!

73
00:07:11,456 --> 00:07:12,707
Get your hair out your face.

74
00:07:14,084 --> 00:07:15,627
Get your hair out your face.

75
00:07:27,222 --> 00:07:31,434
TERRORIST KILLERS
WANTED

76
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:46,116
Twice, yes.
Babiu, the first is silver.

77
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:51,246
What time will Veroca arrive
from cinema?

78
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:56,124
Calm down, she's coming. They went
to drop the kids off at home, ok?

79
00:08:01,172 --> 00:08:02,632
Cuchimbas, turn up the sound.

80
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:08,096
<i>Giovanni Bucher has his car
intercepted on the way to the embassy</i>

81
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:10,974
<i>shorty before 9am today.</i>

82
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:16,533
<i>The kidnappers captured the diplomat
after injuring his security guard,</i>

83
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:21,841
<i>who was shot in the back of the head
and is hospitalized in serious condition.</i>

84
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,168
<i>In a quick and violent action,</i>

85
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,882
<i>eight men and one woman used
a Willys Aero model car</i>

86
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,152
<i>to block his car in the Laranjeira
neighborhood, in the South Zone...</i>

87
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:38,057
- Didn't they let this guy go away?
- No, darling, that was the German.

88
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:40,168
- This one's Swiss.
- <i>...People nearby said,</i>

89
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:45,965
<i>after they heard gunshots, they saw a
two-door Volkswagen passing very fast</i>

90
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,165
<i>heading towards Flamengo.</i>

91
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:52,515
<i>Pamphlets were left at the
scene of the action, signed</i>

92
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:55,774
<i>by responsible organization
for the kidnapping,</i>

93
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:59,127
<i>that calls itself
"National Liberation Alliance".</i>

94
00:08:59,898 --> 00:09:02,108
- Ah, he's cute.
- But you won't take care of him.

95
00:09:06,237 --> 00:09:10,283
- What is this?
- I'm still shaking. It was fucked up.

96
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,705
What happened, girl?

97
00:09:11,993 --> 00:09:13,877
Watch your mouth, Veroca.
Where were you?

98
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:18,333
I went to drop Helena off at home
and we were stopped by the police.

99
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:21,667
The cops were agressive,
searching everyone.

100
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,185
It was awful.

101
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,898
Another ambassador
was kidnapped.

102
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,920
- Another?
- Yes. We saw on TV now.

103
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,399
Oh, Mother of God.

104
00:09:28,503 --> 00:09:30,588
Luckily, Pimpão has his
father's BBA card in the car.

105
00:09:30,664 --> 00:09:32,332
What is BBA mean?

106
00:09:32,356 --> 00:09:34,356
That's why is good to have a
lawyer in the family.

107
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:37,928
- I wish I had that luck.
- It's Brazilian Bar Association, honey.

108
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:41,815
- Want me to fix your dinner?
- No Zezé, I'm not hungry, thank you.

109
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,951
- Mrs. Eunice, this girl is not eating.
- You're screwed.

110
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:48,832
Listen, go to talk to your
dad, he was worried.

111
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:49,922
Gimme.

112
00:09:50,624 --> 00:09:52,057
This ambassador situation is crazy.

113
00:09:53,643 --> 00:09:54,643
Veroca, Veroca.

114
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,545
Look! Dad call him Pimpão.

115
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,652
- Don't tell him.
- Did he leave already?

116
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:02,043
He promised me a
ride in the Dodge.

117
00:10:02,293 --> 00:10:04,379
- Another day.
- Oh, Wallaby. No.

118
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:07,048
You're not going to be riding
in that playboy's car, no.

119
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:13,972
Funny, I thought playboys drank
whiskey and smoked cigars all day...

120
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:17,475
No, sweetie, I'm the guy who
pays for your mid-afternoon film.

121
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,798
What did you go to see?

122
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,786
<i>Blow-Up.</i>
The sound was shitty.

123
00:10:23,876 --> 00:10:26,044
Your mom got nervous when
you disappeared like that.

124
00:10:26,061 --> 00:10:28,287
Dad, what do you intend to do?
Lock me inside the house?

125
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:28,990
Notify us.

126
00:10:29,072 --> 00:10:31,398
It's not my fault if many
soldiers is catching...

127
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,422
Who want coffee?

128
00:10:35,236 --> 00:10:36,988
Dad, how many prisoners
did they ask for now?

129
00:10:37,014 --> 00:10:40,247
- I don't know.
- Everyone go to bed. Now.

130
00:10:40,271 --> 00:10:42,271
No, I wanna finish
watching the news.

131
00:10:42,295 --> 00:10:44,295
No, no, no. To bed.

132
00:10:44,319 --> 00:10:46,519
Marcelo, the dog goes in the garage.

133
00:10:50,843 --> 00:10:56,743
I'll call Dalva to see if Helena
arraved well. Sounds like it wasn't pretty.

134
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:27,478
Today, Dalva insisted again that
we go to London with them.

135
00:11:29,102 --> 00:11:31,302
But then she offered to
take only Veroca.

136
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:34,826
It's good ideia.

137
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:36,550
- Do you think?
- I do.

138
00:11:36,574 --> 00:11:38,574
Next year, she'll start college. So...

139
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:40,598
What?

140
00:11:40,622 --> 00:11:44,422
Do you think there is no chance that
Veroca won't get involved in trouble?

141
00:11:44,446 --> 00:11:46,446
The way she is.

142
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:51,270
Let's wait. Let them settle down first.

143
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:55,588
Then we'll see. No rush.

144
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,917
No rush?
Why are Gaspa and Dalva leaving?

145
00:11:59,941 --> 00:12:03,041
Gaspa's paranoid.
Thinks he's being watched.

146
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:10,257
Let's send her to there.
At least until this phase is over.

147
00:12:11,819 --> 00:12:13,119
It'll pass soon.

148
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:18,493
Do you remember her in
the macrobiotic phase?

149
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,215
Lasted two weeks.

150
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:24,622
Yeah, but no one gets arrested
for being macrobiotic, Rubens.

151
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,640
You're right.

152
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,640
I will talk to Gaspa.

153
00:12:30,769 --> 00:12:32,769
- Yeah?
- Yes, it's gonna be okay.

154
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:39,136
- Hello?
- <i>Hello. It's Rubens Paiva?</i>

155
00:12:39,323 --> 00:12:41,790
- Yes.
- <i>I came to deliver a delivery.</i>

156
00:12:42,213 --> 00:12:46,329
Work, I'll go pick it up in my office.
Do you hang up for me, please?

157
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:10,997
...Belfim Moreira, 80.

158
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,166
Exactly.

159
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,061
No, you can leave this at the office.

160
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,132
Exactly, in the Downtown.
Do you know the address?

161
00:13:21,156 --> 00:13:23,156
<i>I know, you'll want know a lot...</i>

162
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:28,277
Alright, I'm turning off.

163
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,495
What is this squirrel doing awake?

164
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:38,161
- I smelled your cigar.
- A better nose than Pimpão.

165
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,264
What is this for?

166
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,312
This is for doing math,
measuring a liar's nose.

167
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,759
Who were you talking to?

168
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,886
Dad's on a secret mission.
Do you know what it is?

169
00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:00,926
I conclude that you have no chance
of winning against me at Foosball.

170
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,229
Your chances are zero.

171
00:14:03,777 --> 00:14:04,977
Can I prove that you're wrong?

172
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:07,336
- Do you want to try it now?
- Come.

173
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,760
Won't cry so as not to
wake all in the house.

174
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,983
- Wallaby, come please.
- I will.

175
00:14:12,132 --> 00:14:13,632
If you're going to cry,
cry quietly.

176
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:16,195
- Cry? I will not.
- Keep voice down.

177
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,537
- 1 vs 1. Dad?
- Let's go!

178
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,133
It's Brazil. Brazil knows.

179
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:24,178
Fuck, Marcelo!
Go to sleep!

180
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,769
It's the beginning of the
turning point. Come on.

181
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:31,481
Wash him properly, Marcelo.
Wow, it's easy, guys.

182
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,968
Now he'll smell good.

183
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:38,673
You didn't answer me, eh?
Under your bed it's disgusting.

184
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,111
Because you slept with him dirty.

185
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,680
So, you slept...

186
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,752
You can meet an English boy.
Fall in love with the next John Lennon.

187
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,050
Guys, I'm going back
to study Sociology.

188
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,596
But you don't have to decide now,
do you, sweetie?

189
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,446
Travel, enjoy it and when
you come back, decide.

190
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:15,375
I've already made up
my mind, Mom.

191
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:19,017
Rum raisin for my
Mediterranean.

192
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:23,288
Very good.
What did you call Mom?

193
00:16:23,474 --> 00:16:26,174
Son, it's a mix of Italian,
Spanish, Greek, and Turkish.

194
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:28,874
Your mother, the most beautiful
woman in the world.

195
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,238
Me.

196
00:16:31,883 --> 00:16:35,383
Veroca, Veroca.
Find me an English boyfriend.

197
00:16:35,762 --> 00:16:37,582
- You can't date yet.
- Of course, I can date.

198
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:39,844
Veroca, will you miss me?

199
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,358
Of course I'll miss you, my love.

200
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:44,664
- And me?
- No.

201
00:16:47,793 --> 00:16:50,253
Oh, dear. Veroca.
Poor boy.

202
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,293
I will, I will.

203
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,840
- This one is for you.
- Thank you, Dalva.

204
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,510
Veroca promised not to give
you any trouble.

205
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:12,104
She'll be no trouble at all.

206
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:14,590
I can always go in her place.

207
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:18,754
It's easier for me to take
the whole family there.

208
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:22,956
When our house is almost renovated,
we will travel there.

209
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:28,215
Oh, please, Eunice. Once you move into
that house, you'll never leave Rio.

210
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:31,823
- Is this one for Babiu?
- Yeah, for Babiu.

211
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:34,109
And this one, I chose for you.

212
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:36,346
Wow.

213
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,056
It's getting too
dangerous here, Rubens.

214
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:44,717
I won't wait to see it.
You should do the same and come with us.

215
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:48,578
I'm sending Veroca first to
see if it's not a scam.

216
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:52,249
Offering shelter to an entire
family in London?

217
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:54,989
Hey, what is this?
You are all my family, too.

218
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:03,760
You'll be back soon. To reopen the
bookshop and publishing house.

219
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:08,310
It won't be long, you'll see.

220
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:12,797
Son of bitch.

221
00:18:17,088 --> 00:18:19,155
- I love you, man.
- I love you.

222
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:46,095
Are you taking that all?

223
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:47,871
Just this one.

224
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:52,601
- Take it.
- Seriously?

225
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,616
Just don't let Eliana touch it.

226
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:00,472
Vera?

227
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:02,599
Yay.

228
00:19:05,086 --> 00:19:06,766
Don't spend on disks, ok?

229
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:11,671
There you can buy a boot, as good
boots are essential for the cold.

230
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:12,984
Thank you.

231
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:16,145
Mom, do you still have
that brown coat?

232
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,256
- Which one?
- The fur-lined one.

233
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:26,009
- This one.
- This one.

234
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,410
- But it's so old.
- It's new yet.

235
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,440
A gift from your dad.
Honeymoon in Bariloche.

236
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,539
Can I borrow it?

237
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:52,464
You'd better behave there.
Dalva has enough on her mind.

238
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:55,134
I can take care of myself, Mom.

239
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:59,946
All right. Take cara of my coat,
then, I'll want it back.

240
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:01,491
I promise.

241
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:08,238
Don't run off right away.
I'll make a soufflé for you, young lady.

242
00:20:09,892 --> 00:20:10,892
Nalu!

243
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:14,155
Come on! Come on!

244
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:20,176
Goal!

245
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:23,471
It's a goal!

246
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:26,725
Look at him.

247
00:21:08,442 --> 00:21:10,878
Do you know if someone's
interested in this house?

248
00:21:10,945 --> 00:21:11,945
You, right?

249
00:21:12,005 --> 00:21:15,461
I'm looking for a place like
this, here, in South Zone.

250
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:21,484
Rubens hasn't even started the new house.
But I can introduce you to a great realtor.

251
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:25,551
I want to. Our townhouse can't
handle the new students.

252
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:29,130
I don't know how Dalal manages
to run a school alone.

253
00:21:29,547 --> 00:21:31,647
I don't have five
children, right, Eunice?

254
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:34,257
- She has six if we count...
- Rubens.

255
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:40,157
What a delicious smell. How do
you keep it from sticking to the pan?

256
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:46,462
Beatriz I told you. You run a knife around
the edge, put it in a very hot ove and

257
00:21:47,365 --> 00:21:49,045
don't open it, that's it.

258
00:21:49,133 --> 00:21:50,833
- I can't believe.
- It's true.

259
00:21:51,027 --> 00:21:55,635
Look how sweet the girls are dancing.
It's good they don't understand French.

260
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:06,089
- Did you see your sister?
- Isn't she in her room?

261
00:22:06,117 --> 00:22:08,337
- Take your hand off your mouth.
- It's already falling.

262
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:10,470
Let it fall on its own.
Is anyone up there?

263
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:12,121
No.

264
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,300
Brasília is a ticking time bomb.

265
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,969
The military will hit hard.

266
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:22,670
Seventy prisoners for an
ambassador, they're playing with fire.

267
00:22:23,693 --> 00:22:25,493
How are the things at
the newspaper?

268
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,280
Worse by the day.

269
00:22:27,663 --> 00:22:30,743
I've never see a lot of people
exchanged for an embassador.

270
00:22:30,901 --> 00:22:33,321
If they let these people go,
are they going to kill him?

271
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:37,522
No, honey.

272
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:41,610
I bet right now the
ambassador is comfortable.

273
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:46,346
- And he is.
- With a Moët & Chandon.

274
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:53,495
Soufflé's in the oven.
Who's hungry?

275
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,649
Soufflé with Swiss cheese.

276
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:02,595
Eliana, wet bikini in the couch?
Go change.

277
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:04,399
- It's too hot.
- No.

278
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:06,948
- I told her. She don't listen.
- Veroca is not here.

279
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:07,911
Never mind.

280
00:23:08,156 --> 00:23:10,289
Yesterday I nearly broke my arm.
When I was playing with them.

281
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:15,058
- I fell on my arm.
- Son, your stories are long and confusing.

282
00:23:15,753 --> 00:23:18,486
Tell this story for your father's honour.

283
00:23:18,765 --> 00:23:19,765
I'll ask for a blessing.

284
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:25,518
This girl is calmer, but
this one I will...

285
00:23:28,216 --> 00:23:29,896
Have you ever repeated.

286
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:36,471
Maybe I'll have to ask
my old man to go.

287
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:51,244
Dad, isn't this my party?
I get to pick the music.

288
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:54,822
What is this peace and love
girl complaining about?

289
00:23:55,968 --> 00:23:58,235
You'll get tired of foreign
music. Shall we dance?

290
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:00,539
Can I dance with this young lady?

291
00:24:00,631 --> 00:24:03,187
- Why are you asking him?
- I'm asking. Shall we dance?

292
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:04,776
No way.

293
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:17,021
Can you believe our Veroca's
going away, alone?

294
00:25:17,975 --> 00:25:19,975
Soon it'll be just you and me.

295
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:26,922
My tooth fell out!

296
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:37,366
Babiu! Babiu!

297
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,750
Dad, what if someone finds it?

298
00:25:44,843 --> 00:25:47,143
Baby, not a chance. Look at
the size of the beach.

299
00:25:48,006 --> 00:25:49,686
What if we don't find it?

300
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:53,359
We will. I counted the steps
from home to here.

301
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:05,828
Get ready, let's take a photo.
Babiu! Babiu!

302
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:10,792
C’me, let's take a photo.
Come here, Rubens.

303
00:26:10,904 --> 00:26:12,837
Get closer. Closer.

304
00:26:13,431 --> 00:26:14,531
Go, Rubens.

305
00:26:15,833 --> 00:26:18,713
Let's go, let's go.
C’me here, c’me here.

306
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:24,315
Eunice, no, no.
Let me do it.

307
00:26:24,467 --> 00:26:25,834
You have to be in the photo.

308
00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:27,156
- Really?
- Sure.

309
00:26:27,878 --> 00:26:28,878
Let's go.

310
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:32,019
Attention, get ready.

311
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,908
Nobody serious, okay? Go.

312
00:26:36,053 --> 00:26:38,319
Attention. "Ditch the Ditchtators"!

313
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:41,528
One, two, three, and...

314
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:04,433
I'll take it, Zezé.

315
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:07,917
Hello?

316
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:10,529
He's not at home.

317
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:12,630
Who is it?

318
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:17,969
Hello?

319
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:44,969
Rubens, someone left this for you.

320
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:48,262
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

321
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,307
TO RUBENS PAIVA
FROM VERA LENNON

322
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:13,126
"Guys, this is not just a letter, is a sensory
experience like the <i>Mutantes</i> concert."

323
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:21,470
"This is our street, it's very funny
like <i>Blow-Up</i>. All the houses are similar."

324
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,118
Me and the chimney.

325
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:30,610
"Just the doors are different. It's kind
weird to spend Christmans without a beach."

326
00:28:31,269 --> 00:28:34,837
"But we discovered that there
are how to have fun in the cold."

327
00:28:35,089 --> 00:28:36,169
"We even made a snowman."

328
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:40,722
- Look, it's Dalva!
- "Remind you of someone?"

329
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:48,850
"And how about this street?
It was so exciting."

330
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:56,588
"Nalu. Can you believe my feet touched
the same ground as John Lennon?"

331
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:00,339
"Hard to believe the Beatles
ever recorded here..."

332
00:29:00,731 --> 00:29:01,851
The bus, watch out!

333
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,956
- Look, my English boyfriend!
- You don't speak English, right?

334
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:15,048
"Look at this musical shop.
I could camp out here."

335
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:21,362
"We stayed until closing.
I only bought one single, okay, Mom?"

336
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:25,570
"It's not for me. It's for...

337
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:26,847
Pimpão".

338
00:29:26,916 --> 00:29:30,756
- If it's any consolation.
- "He will enjoy this glam rock stoff".

339
00:29:31,789 --> 00:29:38,689
"I hope you're all well. Kisses,
miss you all, Vera 'Lennon'."

340
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,517
- Put it on again.
- Again?

341
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:50,128
Wait, I'll rewind the tape.

342
00:29:50,415 --> 00:29:51,615
It's rewinding.

343
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:54,846
Wait. Okay. It's done.

344
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,763
- Can I read this time, Dad?
- Yes, darling. Sure.

345
00:29:58,272 --> 00:29:59,392
- Ready?
- Can I go?

346
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,590
- Wait, I'll turn it off here.
- Can I start?

347
00:30:03,894 --> 00:30:07,494
"This is our house, it is very funny
because it's the same as others."

348
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:14,790
"Really similar, like that ones in
<i>Blow-Up</i>. Just the doors are different."

349
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,840
Wait, just a second.

350
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:20,837
Get out of the way.

351
00:30:21,996 --> 00:30:24,396
"It's kind weird to spend
Christmas without the beach."

352
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:27,803
"But snow is cool, too.
We even made our first snowman."

353
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:30,244
"Remind you of someone?"

354
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:33,772
"And how about this street?"

355
00:30:49,323 --> 00:30:53,291
If I don't organize these photos
I'll end up confusing myself.

356
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:59,227
Love, can't we put air conditioning
in the kids' room?

357
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:01,875
No. The house will be breezy.

358
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:06,245
There's a cobogó wall, a big varanda.

359
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,967
- Pick it up, honey.
- I'm playing.

360
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,126
Hello?

361
00:31:21,922 --> 00:31:25,122
That's right, at the corner of
Almirante Guimarães.

362
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:30,076
We'll be here all afternoon.
Thanks.

363
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:36,134
Is there a good movie at the Pax?

364
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:38,781
No. We have dinner at Dalal's.
Boca didn't say it?

365
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,780
We can go to the movies afterward.

366
00:31:43,652 --> 00:31:46,452
- Ready for backgammon?
- I'm always ready.

367
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:53,359
- Where are you going?
- I'll prepare lunch.

368
00:31:54,613 --> 00:31:55,613
Mr. Rubens?

369
00:31:55,989 --> 00:31:57,722
There are some men here...

370
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,240
What's going on?

371
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:03,558
Congressman Rubens Paiva?

372
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:06,914
There must be some mistake, I haven't
been in Congress for years now.

373
00:32:07,109 --> 00:32:09,509
There's no mistake, sir,
you're coming with us.

374
00:32:09,611 --> 00:32:11,744
- Where to?
- To give a deposition.

375
00:32:12,489 --> 00:32:13,489
It's routine.

376
00:32:13,658 --> 00:32:15,791
A deposition about what, Rubens?

377
00:32:15,819 --> 00:32:17,019
It's all right.

378
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:20,310
- I just need to change.
- Of course.

379
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:21,564
Go with him.

380
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:25,834
Anyone else at home?

381
00:32:28,155 --> 00:32:33,187
Just my children. They're upstairs.
There's no need for weapons.

382
00:32:58,827 --> 00:33:00,807
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, honey.

383
00:33:01,231 --> 00:33:02,231
Where's Daddy?

384
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,414
He's in the bedroom.

385
00:33:04,484 --> 00:33:06,384
I'll get a glass of water
in the kitchen.

386
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,560
I'll get it for you, Cristina.

387
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:09,654
Good morning.

388
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:14,825
- Dad?
- Hi.

389
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:17,036
- Dad?
- Here.

390
00:33:19,932 --> 00:33:21,372
Can I borrow this?

391
00:33:22,384 --> 00:33:24,984
Sure. Take it.

392
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:29,248
Give me a kiss.

393
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,746
Where you going all dressed up?

394
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,652
Up to the office for a bit.

395
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:44,291
But it's a holiday.

396
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:50,047
I'm just going to help these
gentlemen. I'll back soon, sweetie.

397
00:33:50,788 --> 00:33:51,788
Okay.

398
00:34:18,766 --> 00:34:22,542
Honey, I changed my mind. Sleep
at Cris's house and tomorrow

399
00:34:22,936 --> 00:34:25,203
you can go to ballet
together, right?

400
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:26,647
Thank you.

401
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:29,866
Cristina, tell to
Sebastião show up later.

402
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:31,010
I will.

403
00:34:31,695 --> 00:34:34,895
- Can I go with him?
- Your husband will be home soon.

404
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,583
I'll be back in time
for the soufflé.

405
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,191
Where's the deposition?

406
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,680
I don't have that information.

407
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:29,222
And what about you all?

408
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:31,919
We'll keep you company, ma'am.

409
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:52,656
- Mom?
- Hi, son. Did you sleep well?

410
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:55,922
Who are these guys?

411
00:35:56,196 --> 00:35:58,929
They're from pest control.
Are you hungry?

412
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:01,629
C'mere, eat something.

413
00:36:04,371 --> 00:36:05,371
Chocolate?

414
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:07,761
Is my Dad at the beach?

415
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:11,375
He went out for a bit.
He will back soon.

416
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:24,997
Mrs. Eunice, I'm a bundle of nerves.

417
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,119
Where's the extension?

418
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:36,183
One in the office and another upstairs.

419
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:48,614
If it's for your husband,
say that he's out of town.

420
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:54,128
Hello?

421
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:56,672
Hi, Dalal.

422
00:36:58,508 --> 00:37:02,668
Yes, but today won't work. Cuz' 
Rubens has to travel at the last minute.

423
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:09,939
No, it's not serious. It's a family
matter, he'll be back tomorrow.

424
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,620
Okay. Give Boca my best.

425
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:24,682
We haven't been introduced yet.

426
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:27,661
I am Eunice.

427
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:30,289
Schneider.

428
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,017
Are you gentlemen staying for lunch?

429
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:36,936
No need to bother.

430
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:38,797
I insist.

431
00:37:43,608 --> 00:37:47,192
<i>...This wave of car thefts that's
taking over the city.</i>

432
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:50,943
<i>A car with an open door is
an invitation to crime.</i>

433
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:01,315
Babiu, eat it.

434
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:18,202
What exactly do you do,
Mr. Schneider?

435
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:22,353
I'm a parapsychologist.

436
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,740
A parapsychologist?

437
00:38:30,784 --> 00:38:33,117
Mom, why's the house all closed up?

438
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:35,070
Eliena, go take a shower,
and then have lunch.

439
00:38:35,223 --> 00:38:37,823
After the game.
I came to get the ball.

440
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:39,663
No, not now, sweetie.

441
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:43,693
- What is this?
- No one leaves til your dad comes back.

442
00:38:44,449 --> 00:38:45,929
Where did Dad go, Mom?

443
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:47,866
Let's go to your room.

444
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:49,709
But Mom, they're waiting
for me at the net.

445
00:38:49,729 --> 00:38:52,009
- You can play later.
- Mom, I literally have the ball.

446
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,039
No, Eliana.

447
00:38:54,608 --> 00:38:57,884
Mom, what is going on?
Who are these guys?

448
00:38:57,970 --> 00:39:00,262
- Why can't I go out?
- Eliana, they took your father.

449
00:39:00,722 --> 00:39:03,055
- Where to?
- I don't know, sweetie.

450
00:39:03,183 --> 00:39:06,415
They said he had to answer a
few questions. I don't know where.

451
00:39:06,661 --> 00:39:09,261
- Are they policemen?
- I think they're from the army.

452
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:14,419
Calm down, honey.

453
00:39:17,489 --> 00:39:18,808
Do you know if
he's okay or not?

454
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:25,803
It'll be okay.
Just don't tell the little ones.

455
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:41,368
Babiu. Can you help me
here in the kitchen?

456
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:42,838
Yeah.

457
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:16,259
That's enough, Marcelo.

458
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:18,165
I'm going.

459
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:21,817
Go to room, your sister
is already in bed. Go.

460
00:40:22,621 --> 00:40:26,653
- Tomorrow we'll finish.
- Tomorrow, these gentlemen won't be here.

461
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:29,801
You won.

462
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:34,880
Is there anything else I
can do for you gentlemen?

463
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:37,458
There' food in the fridge,
if you're hungry.

464
00:40:39,062 --> 00:40:41,328
We'll get by all right, thank you.

465
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:47,142
Could you call and check when
Rubens will be back?

466
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:50,129
It's getting late and I'm worried.

467
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:52,757
I can't do that, unfortunately.

468
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:00,278
Let's go up to sleep.

469
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,201
- Mom, they're armed.
- I know, darling.

470
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:15,237
- Can I sleep in your bed?
- Best stay with your siblings.

471
00:41:15,515 --> 00:41:16,515
Please.

472
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:24,623
Just a shift change, Mrs. Eunice.
You can go back to bed.

473
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:27,998
I'm not tired.

474
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:37,531
Eliana?

475
00:43:38,491 --> 00:43:39,491
Sweetie.

476
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:41,701
Is Dad back?

477
00:43:42,179 --> 00:43:46,079
No, honey. We will make
a deposition, too. Okay?

478
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:48,959
Me too?

479
00:43:49,544 --> 00:43:52,944
Yes, honey. Wear this clothes.
Don't worry, we'll be back soon.

480
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:15,142
Stay with the children
for me, please.

481
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:27,698
Put this on, please.

482
00:46:03,445 --> 00:46:04,825
Where is my daughter?

483
00:46:06,398 --> 00:46:09,265
Eliana's outside.
Sorry about the hood, Mrs. Eunice.

484
00:46:10,268 --> 00:46:11,788
Do you accept this?

485
00:46:13,104 --> 00:46:14,704
Where is my husband?

486
00:46:18,177 --> 00:46:21,165
CONFIDENTIAL SUBJECT
MARIA L. EUNICE FACCIOLLA PAIVA

487
00:46:21,237 --> 00:46:22,737
How long have you
been married?

488
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:24,470
I want to see him.

489
00:46:24,641 --> 00:46:26,508
Here it says eighteen years.

490
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:31,073
Was your husband already an ally
of the communists when you two met?

491
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,266
My husband was in the Labor Party.

492
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:39,178
I'd like to call my lawyer.

493
00:46:41,082 --> 00:46:43,382
No need. These are just
routine questions.

494
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:47,766
I'll only answer after I've seen
my daughter and my husband.

495
00:46:52,112 --> 00:46:56,932
He's upstairs. He's already told us
 everything he knows.

496
00:46:57,115 --> 00:47:00,059
- He's waiting for you to confirm.
- To confirm, what?

497
00:47:00,735 --> 00:47:03,651
That he left the country in '64 for
conspiring against the revolution.

498
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:16,431
Rubens was a congressman.
He was ousted and had to go into exile.

499
00:47:16,626 --> 00:47:20,106
But since he came back to Brazil, he
hasn't been involved in politics.

500
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:23,679
So why is he still fraternizing
with terrorists?

501
00:47:24,167 --> 00:47:25,167
He's not...

502
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:32,239
<i>Motherfucks, you're gonna kill me!</i>

503
00:47:41,801 --> 00:47:44,341
We've been keeping an eye on
comings and goings at your house

504
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:46,667
for a while, Mrs. Eunice.

505
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:49,740
We like to receive friends at home.

506
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:05,522
And are any of those friends here?

507
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:34,869
No.

508
00:48:42,211 --> 00:48:48,983
Mrs. Eunice, I'm trying to make sure
you can keep taking care of your home.

509
00:48:50,386 --> 00:48:54,162
Driving your children to school
and playing your backgammon.

510
00:48:55,808 --> 00:48:56,928
That's my job.

511
00:49:04,593 --> 00:49:06,393
How's Vera doing in London?

512
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:09,486
Did you do something
to my daughter?

513
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:11,372
- Did she do something wrong?
- No.

514
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:13,299
So, there's no need to worry.

515
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:26,148
Shall we try again?

516
00:49:31,594 --> 00:49:32,874
Who is this here?

517
00:49:35,306 --> 00:49:36,306
Rubens.

518
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:39,780
See? It's not difficult.

519
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:42,741
Who else do you know?

520
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:47,308
Look carefully.

521
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:56,791
Martha, my daughters' teacher.

522
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:59,744
I don't know what she's doing there.

523
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:05,470
Martha was intercepted
at the airport, yesterday.

524
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:09,574
Her son provides logistics for the
subversives fleeing to Chile.

525
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:14,260
It can't be the same person.

526
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:17,095
She brought letters to Rubens.

527
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:21,457
I want to know how he gets
those letters to the terrorists.

528
00:50:25,231 --> 00:50:28,943
I already told you. Rubens
has no connection to terrorists.

529
00:50:29,485 --> 00:50:32,557
Mrs. Eunice, you need to
rethink your behaviour.

530
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:43,680
Am I going to see my
daughter now?

531
00:50:44,885 --> 00:50:46,952
- What is this?
- It's protocol.

532
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:50,987
But you said that if I answered
I'd see my family...

533
00:50:51,924 --> 00:50:53,024
We're not done yet.

534
00:50:59,515 --> 00:51:01,115
Is my daughter here?

535
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:03,926
- Is my daughter here?
- Mom?

536
00:51:04,103 --> 00:51:05,303
- Eliana!
- What's going on?

537
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:09,772
- Sit down. Be quiet.
- They'll ask you a few questions.

538
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:11,867
- Then we'll return to home.
- Ma'am.

539
00:51:12,987 --> 00:51:14,427
She's my daughter!

540
00:51:16,991 --> 00:51:18,111
She's just a child.

541
00:51:19,243 --> 00:51:20,283
Just a child.

542
00:51:45,628 --> 00:51:47,628
Don't let them do anything
to my daughter.

543
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:51,614
Be quiet. Otherwise you'll
annoy them more.

544
00:52:27,436 --> 00:52:28,876
Eliana, your turn.

545
00:52:56,465 --> 00:52:57,465
Name?

546
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:00,743
How long have I been here?

547
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:02,006
Say your name.

548
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:04,595
Eunice Paiva.

549
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:06,182
Full name.

550
00:53:07,518 --> 00:53:10,051
Maria Lucrécia Eunice
Facciolla Paiva.

551
00:53:11,814 --> 00:53:13,747
I want to talk to my husband.

552
00:53:19,697 --> 00:53:21,217
Look one more time.

553
00:53:34,495 --> 00:53:36,175
I told you, I don't know.

554
00:53:36,497 --> 00:53:38,764
I just wanted to
change my clothes.

555
00:53:39,425 --> 00:53:40,545
One more time.

556
00:53:58,603 --> 00:53:59,603
My daughter.

557
00:54:00,605 --> 00:54:01,645
Where is she?

558
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:04,239
I don't have that information.

559
00:54:06,702 --> 00:54:08,635
Do you recognize anyone else?

560
00:54:25,012 --> 00:54:27,145
- Eliana?
- Don't talk, be quiet.

561
00:54:27,499 --> 00:54:28,499
Eliana?

562
00:54:29,892 --> 00:54:32,158
Your daughter is not
here anymore.

563
00:54:37,859 --> 00:54:39,592
She only stayed one night.

564
00:54:39,669 --> 00:54:41,669
And how long have I been here?

565
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:43,620
- Five days.
- My husband...

566
00:54:44,499 --> 00:54:46,832
His name is Rubens.
Did you see him?

567
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:51,999
<i>Shut the fuck up!</i>

568
00:56:04,987 --> 00:56:05,987
<i>A doctor.</i>

569
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:08,425
<i>They need a doctor.</i>

570
00:56:14,538 --> 00:56:18,574
<i>Stop. For God's sake.
I don't know anything!</i>

571
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:22,211
<i>I'm afraid!</i>

572
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:48,738
Full name.

573
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:51,639
Maria Lucrécia Eunice
Facciolla Paiva.

574
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:25,759
Where am I going?

575
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:28,885
I just want you to know, ma'am,
that I don't agree with it.

576
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:00,030
Sweetie.

577
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:03,200
Come here.

578
01:01:10,292 --> 01:01:11,492
Where were you?

579
01:01:17,257 --> 01:01:18,257
Calm down.

580
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:24,404
Do you want to eat something?

581
01:01:28,977 --> 01:01:32,410
Your mom, just need to sleep a bit.

582
01:01:35,734 --> 01:01:38,634
Okay? Tomorrow we'll wake up
and eat together.

583
01:01:43,617 --> 01:01:45,297
Mom, what's happening?

584
01:02:04,763 --> 01:02:05,763
Eliana?

585
01:02:08,183 --> 01:02:09,183
Eliana?

586
01:02:12,938 --> 01:02:14,538
- What?
- Mom is back.

587
01:02:16,274 --> 01:02:18,474
- And Daddy?
- No.

588
01:02:21,321 --> 01:02:22,841
Is she in her room?

589
01:02:23,490 --> 01:02:25,356
She asked no one to come in.

590
01:02:32,123 --> 01:02:33,803
Can I sleep with you?

591
01:02:36,378 --> 01:02:37,378
Yes.

592
01:03:15,292 --> 01:03:18,876
I wanted to wait for you there,
but they wouldn't let me.

593
01:03:19,421 --> 01:03:20,421
Sorry.

594
01:03:27,595 --> 01:03:29,529
Did they do something to you?

595
01:03:33,268 --> 01:03:36,664
They asked a lot of questions,
but I said I didn't know anything.

596
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:43,117
Did you see your dad there?

597
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:49,291
It's in the paper that he escaped.

598
01:03:50,243 --> 01:03:51,243
Escaped?

599
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:53,311
But Lino said it was a lie.

600
01:03:54,205 --> 01:03:56,841
- Was Lino here?
- No, I heard it at Boca's house.

601
01:03:57,542 --> 01:04:01,446
I go there every day after school,
we were trying to find you.

602
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:05,090
Don't, Mom.

603
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:08,788
It's better not to use the telephone.
Let's go, I'm gonna with you.

604
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:11,113
No, Eliana. You will go to school.

605
01:04:11,890 --> 01:04:14,714
- But Mom, I want to know what...
- Eliana, you will go to the school.

606
01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:19,790
- Mom, I'm already helping them.
- Your mom is taking care of this now.

607
01:04:20,648 --> 01:04:21,768
- Mom!
- Mommy!

608
01:04:22,317 --> 01:04:23,317
My babies.

609
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:28,984
Where's Daddy?

610
01:04:30,776 --> 01:04:31,909
TERRORISTS RESCUE PRISONER

611
01:04:32,327 --> 01:04:36,293
This headline was created, Eunice. At least
 now they can't deny that he was arrested.

612
01:04:36,915 --> 01:04:39,015
Did they deny Rubens' arrest?

613
01:04:39,751 --> 01:04:41,451
They said has nothing to
do with the army.

614
01:04:42,128 --> 01:04:44,476
Same thing happened to the
<i>Pasquim</i> guys, and they're fine.

615
01:04:44,756 --> 01:04:47,564
Exactly. Vanished for two
months, then released.

616
01:04:49,094 --> 01:04:51,402
The international community is
watching closely.

617
01:04:52,055 --> 01:04:54,747
What about a photo?
Of the family without the father?

618
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:57,258
It's good, sure.
Put it on the cover.

619
01:04:58,228 --> 01:05:00,161
- We can't do that.
- Why not?

620
01:05:00,372 --> 01:05:03,980
The newspaper is getting worse, guys.
Only what the military wants comes out.

621
01:05:04,192 --> 01:05:08,032
I'm thinking <i>The New York Times</i>,
<i>Le Monde</i>. How's your French?

622
01:05:08,696 --> 01:05:11,476
- I don't know what to say.
- Tell them about your arrest.

623
01:05:12,117 --> 01:05:14,117
- Eliana, too.
- Didn't she want to come today?

624
01:05:14,235 --> 01:05:19,651
- No, I send her to school. Is she fine?
- Yes. She's fine. A little scared.

625
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:27,453
Calm. Rubens is a former congressman.
Nothing will happen to him. Okay?

626
01:05:27,791 --> 01:05:30,863
We need to keep showing
that we're watching them.

627
01:05:31,386 --> 01:05:32,906
We need to do more.

628
01:05:33,304 --> 01:05:37,144
Yeah, but without any concrete
evidence that he was arrested

629
01:05:37,809 --> 01:05:39,942
there's not much
else we can do.

630
01:05:41,388 --> 01:05:43,068
- And his car?
- What?

631
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:47,082
His car is parked in the army lot. 
I saw it yesterday.

632
01:05:58,288 --> 01:06:02,064
Mrs. Eunice, Mr. Lino arrived.
Should I put some coffee on?

633
01:06:02,876 --> 01:06:04,556
No, I'm already leaving.

634
01:06:04,878 --> 01:06:09,038
I'll pick the kids up at school.
Just take care of lunch, please.

635
01:06:09,933 --> 01:06:12,400
- What would you like me to make?
- Whatever there is.

636
01:06:22,437 --> 01:06:25,381
<i>...Shoot some tear gas
in the middle of the mob</i>

637
01:06:25,724 --> 01:06:28,024
<i>Ain't be no oxygen
folks are gonna drop</i>

638
01:06:28,309 --> 01:06:30,309
<i>An incendiary grenade
a fire-thrower flashes</i>

639
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:35,501
<i>That troublemaking mob
gonna trample on its ashes...</i>

640
01:06:41,706 --> 01:06:46,826
This is a change of clothes and medicine.
My husband is diabetic, he needs this.

641
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:49,753
I told you, there's no Rubens here.

642
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:52,790
Can you tell us where
he's been taken?

643
01:06:52,884 --> 01:06:55,616
For that, you've got to put in
a request to the federal police.

644
01:06:55,696 --> 01:06:58,696
Okay, thank you.
Can we have the receipt, please?

645
01:07:10,735 --> 01:07:12,735
Where do we make that request?

646
01:07:13,321 --> 01:07:16,881
No use, they'll just deny it. We'll
have to go through the courts.

647
01:07:17,534 --> 01:07:21,054
At least now, with this,
I can file the habeas corpus.

648
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:24,696
I would like to read it.
Can I keep it?

649
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:28,692
It's worse than Greek.
Are you sure?

650
01:07:29,629 --> 01:07:30,629
Yes.

651
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:38,402
I'll pick up the children at school,
then I'll stop to the office to return it.

652
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:41,402
No need, I have a copy.

653
01:07:42,225 --> 01:07:45,125
If there's any news,
I'll let you know. Okay?

654
01:07:51,693 --> 01:07:53,959
I didn't know Rubens was diabetic.

655
01:07:54,589 --> 01:07:55,589
He is not.

656
01:08:40,602 --> 01:08:44,062
I only found out who the letters
were for when I met your husband.

657
01:08:44,579 --> 01:08:46,512
So. Did you see Rubens there?

658
01:08:46,906 --> 01:08:48,773
We were put in the same car.

659
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:51,817
- Where did they take you?
- I don't know.

660
01:08:52,504 --> 01:08:56,792
- They covered our heads with a...
- A hood. They did it to me, too.

661
01:08:59,594 --> 01:09:03,370
What's so hard about putting them
back where they came from?

662
01:09:03,381 --> 01:09:06,573
Martha, you've got to make
a statement to the police.

663
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:08,810
But it was the policemen
who arrested us.

664
01:09:08,878 --> 01:09:10,878
I know, but now they're
saying they didn't.

665
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:16,374
Look Eunice, I'm sorry.
I can't get involved in this.

666
01:09:16,903 --> 01:09:19,911
You're the only person who
saw Rubens there.

667
01:09:20,790 --> 01:09:22,470
You've got to help me.

668
01:09:23,293 --> 01:09:25,293
If I don't prove that
I was arrested...

669
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:32,992
You've got to leave, please.

670
01:09:33,895 --> 01:09:35,575
My husband's in danger, Martha.

671
01:09:37,715 --> 01:09:39,649
Everyone's in danger, Eunice.

672
01:09:57,694 --> 01:10:00,530
- I can walk there, Mom.
- No, that's enough, Ana Lúcia.

673
01:10:00,655 --> 01:10:02,555
Why did Daddy's car 
come back, but he didn’t?

674
01:10:02,857 --> 01:10:05,890
- 'Cause he's still on a trip, my love.
- Isn't this his bag?

675
01:10:05,894 --> 01:10:07,594
Leave that bag there, Marcelo.

676
01:10:07,821 --> 01:10:09,688
I've been missing ballet
for two weeks now.

677
01:10:09,848 --> 01:10:11,315
- Cris said I can go with her.
- No.

678
01:10:11,332 --> 01:10:13,604
From now on, you come straight
home from school.

679
01:10:13,719 --> 01:10:15,386
And nobody goes out on
their own anymore.

680
01:10:16,263 --> 01:10:18,363
- What about Eliana's volleyball?
- I quit the team.

681
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:20,215
Why?

682
01:10:20,967 --> 01:10:22,900
I don't feel like practicing.

683
01:10:23,803 --> 01:10:27,063
<i>...The search for the terrorists
who carried out the kidnapping...</i>

684
01:10:27,134 --> 01:10:29,134
Mom. They're talking
about the ambassador.

685
01:10:29,684 --> 01:10:31,517
That's not for children's ears, honey.

686
01:11:08,639 --> 01:11:09,999
Zezé, get inside.

687
01:11:12,518 --> 01:11:14,618
Do you know where
the key to this gate is?

688
01:11:15,229 --> 01:11:18,096
Does it have a key?
Let me see if it's here.

689
01:11:28,894 --> 01:11:31,561
Pimpão, come here.
Come here, you rascal.

690
01:11:35,308 --> 01:11:37,308
You rascal, you cannot leave.

691
01:11:37,352 --> 01:11:39,652
Don't. Huh.

692
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:46,683
Zezé, what about that car
with those men in it?

693
01:11:47,386 --> 01:11:49,920
It's been there for days, Mrs. Eunice.

694
01:11:50,264 --> 01:11:51,944
But do they do anything?

695
01:11:52,350 --> 01:11:55,358
They just sit there.
Staring over here all day.

696
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:03,644
Your apron's frayed. I told you
should buy a new one.

697
01:12:04,445 --> 01:12:08,081
The cash ran out. I had to use it to
buy groceries while you were away.

698
01:12:08,699 --> 01:12:10,466
There wasn't enough for a new one.

699
01:12:11,077 --> 01:12:15,685
Of course. I will go to the bank and
withdraw some money and replace it.

700
01:12:16,415 --> 01:12:17,415
Mrs. Eunice?

701
01:12:18,126 --> 01:12:19,759
Could you see about my pay, too?

702
01:12:19,945 --> 01:12:22,689
I know you've got
an awful lot on your plate,

703
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:24,740
but Mr. Paiva only paid
me through December.

704
01:12:26,117 --> 01:12:29,689
- I'm sorry, Zezé. I'll sort it out.
- Thank you.

705
01:12:43,985 --> 01:12:45,665
- Thank you.
- Have a sit.

706
01:12:50,208 --> 01:12:52,608
Rubens can call to authorize
the withdrawal.

707
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:55,694
There's no telephone
in the mountains.

708
01:12:56,289 --> 01:12:59,629
He had to stay longer to
monitor the works.

709
01:13:00,293 --> 01:13:03,237
Is there really no way that
you can help me, Ritor?

710
01:13:03,796 --> 01:13:07,892
I understand, but without his
signature there's nothing I can do.

711
01:13:11,930 --> 01:13:13,850
How's Miriam doing?

712
01:13:15,308 --> 01:13:16,768
She's doing well.

713
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:20,337
We need to arrange
to see each other sometime.

714
01:13:20,497 --> 01:13:21,497
Let's arrange it, yes.

715
01:13:24,066 --> 01:13:28,958
Well, I brought some dollars and
pounds I had at home.

716
01:13:31,365 --> 01:13:33,765
Can you exchange them
for me, Ritor?

717
01:13:34,493 --> 01:13:37,481
For sure, Eunice. Just a minute.
I'm gonna call someone to help you.

718
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:39,760
- Thanks.
- Excuse me.

719
01:13:56,641 --> 01:13:57,641
Mom?

720
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:55,240
- Hi.
- Hi.

721
01:14:58,119 --> 01:15:00,252
- Do you know where Mom is?
- No.

722
01:15:03,457 --> 01:15:04,457
Can I have a drag?

723
01:15:06,752 --> 01:15:07,872
- No.
- Please.

724
01:15:08,462 --> 01:15:09,462
No.

725
01:15:12,591 --> 01:15:13,591
You meddler.

726
01:15:18,055 --> 01:15:19,735
Gilda called again today.

727
01:15:19,974 --> 01:15:23,562
She managed to get Vera on the
waiting list for a flight next week.

728
01:15:24,462 --> 01:15:26,662
By the way, a letter from Veroca.

729
01:15:28,816 --> 01:15:32,080
I think it'd be better if she
stayed a while longer.

730
01:15:34,363 --> 01:15:36,696
Do you know how much the ticket is?

731
01:15:36,907 --> 01:15:41,579
I'll deal with Rubens later. He'd
better come back soon, to fix this mess.

732
01:15:46,259 --> 01:15:47,619
Ah, son of bitch.

733
01:15:52,307 --> 01:15:53,307
Ok.

734
01:15:59,764 --> 01:16:03,972
Everyone in my house
doesn't see their friends.

735
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:09,196
Why did they arrest Rubens?

736
01:16:09,774 --> 01:16:10,814
I don't know.

737
01:16:13,778 --> 01:16:16,544
The politicians have no chance.
They're chasing anyone.

738
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:24,110
You're not going to do
that to me, are you?

739
01:16:25,281 --> 01:16:28,081
I've been to that place.
I saw it.

740
01:16:31,796 --> 01:16:34,896
I deserve to know what
Rubens was doing.

741
01:16:37,093 --> 01:16:38,373
Don't you think?

742
01:16:40,346 --> 01:16:41,346
I do.

743
01:16:47,186 --> 01:16:51,553
Eunice, there's no way
to just stand by.

744
01:16:54,068 --> 01:16:56,401
Especially us. We know many people.

745
01:16:57,947 --> 01:17:00,613
Who has the means to
help those in need.

746
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:08,119
So me, Rubens, Gaspa, Raul...

747
01:17:08,433 --> 01:17:14,381
One talks to the foreign press, another
one provides shelter to people on the run,

748
01:17:15,256 --> 01:17:18,156
and deliver letters to
families without news.

749
01:17:19,510 --> 01:17:21,377
Everyone does what they can.

750
01:17:22,763 --> 01:17:26,731
But we're not involved in the armed
struggle. Much less Rubens.

751
01:17:30,146 --> 01:17:35,422
So you decided not to say a word
to me, to Dalal, to Dalva.

752
01:17:37,820 --> 01:17:40,387
- To protect us.
- Of course.

753
01:17:49,248 --> 01:17:51,115
And do you think Rubens 
will be released?

754
01:17:51,876 --> 01:17:54,256
I do. He'll be back soon.

755
01:17:59,008 --> 01:18:02,144
Come have dinner in my house.
Dalal will be glad.

756
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:06,943
I'm not really in the mood.
Too many kids to raise.

757
01:18:09,518 --> 01:18:10,518
Thank you.

758
01:18:15,733 --> 01:18:20,213
"These photos are on the subway.
One out front, one inside the train."

759
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:27,016
"On the day I was going to
a party at the Arraes' house..."

760
01:18:27,194 --> 01:18:28,194
Pass it on, Marcelo.

761
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:30,971
"You won't believe who was there."

762
01:18:32,082 --> 01:18:33,242
- Who, Mom?
- Guess who?

763
01:18:35,628 --> 01:18:36,628
Caetano?

764
01:18:37,796 --> 01:18:38,796
Gil.

765
01:18:39,006 --> 01:18:40,046
Gilberto Gil!

766
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:44,400
"He was wearing polkadot velvet pants."

767
01:18:45,095 --> 01:18:49,063
"A Bob Marley song started playing,
and he asked me to dance."

768
01:18:50,142 --> 01:18:51,422
- No way.
- Such a liar.

769
01:18:51,661 --> 01:18:52,761
"It was amazing."

770
01:18:53,687 --> 01:19:01,303
"I miss the beach, the soufflé, and
you all. I miss everything, Vera."

771
01:19:03,989 --> 01:19:05,669
- Is that it?
- That's it.

772
01:19:06,450 --> 01:19:07,490
Can I see it?

773
01:19:14,333 --> 01:19:15,853
Everyone stay here.

774
01:19:17,419 --> 01:19:18,419
Marcelo!

775
01:19:45,406 --> 01:19:46,406
Pimpão!

776
01:19:56,083 --> 01:19:58,083
What are you looking at?

777
01:20:00,587 --> 01:20:01,947
What do you want?

778
01:20:04,008 --> 01:20:05,988
Where is my husband?!

779
01:20:06,218 --> 01:20:09,098
Go away! Get out of here!
Go away!

780
01:20:09,930 --> 01:20:10,930
Get out!

781
01:20:38,976 --> 01:20:42,276
Zezé, get me a blanket.
Please.

782
01:21:21,585 --> 01:21:27,053
"The Brazilian exiles were asking
about Dad, Mom, and Eliana."

783
01:21:27,841 --> 01:21:31,297
"I didn't know what to say.
I got this awful feeling."

784
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:34,087
"Why don't you tell me anything?"

785
01:21:34,681 --> 01:21:38,905
"I found out about your arrests
from the papers. What's going on?"

786
01:21:39,621 --> 01:21:41,621
"I want to go home soon."

787
01:21:43,607 --> 01:21:45,874
Why didn't you read the rest, Mom?

788
01:21:46,026 --> 01:21:47,959
Give me that letter, sweetie.

789
01:21:48,612 --> 01:21:51,412
No. You skipped the part
about Dad and me.

790
01:21:52,224 --> 01:21:55,024
Everyone's talking about us.
Vera doesn't know what's going on.

791
01:21:55,119 --> 01:21:58,311
- Give me that letter!
- You are lying to us!

792
01:22:00,416 --> 01:22:01,696
Go to your room.

793
01:22:29,595 --> 01:22:31,995
SUPERIOR MILITARY COURT
HABEAS CORPUS

794
01:22:35,394 --> 01:22:38,618
EUNICE PAIVA IS RELEASED AND LAWYER
ASKS SPECIAL PRISON FOR RUBENS PAIVA

795
01:23:03,283 --> 01:23:06,783
HE IS NOT AT THE
DESIGNATED LOCATION

796
01:24:02,246 --> 01:24:06,406
"I still can't describe the excruciating
hours I spent in prison,

797
01:24:07,042 --> 01:24:10,882
but I can guarantee you that
I was there with your husband."

798
01:24:12,506 --> 01:24:16,922
"Although I couldn't see him, I heard
him say: Rubens Beyrodt Paiva."

799
01:24:19,304 --> 01:24:24,296
"Before I was transferred, I heard
his voice one last time, asking for water."

800
01:24:27,729 --> 01:24:30,801
"I pray that the family
will be reunited soon."

801
01:24:32,192 --> 01:24:36,352
"Give my best to my former students
Vera, Eliana, and Ana Lúcia."

802
01:24:52,079 --> 01:24:53,079
- Lino?
- <i>Who is it?</i>

803
01:24:53,572 --> 01:24:56,705
It's me, Lino. I'm sorry
about I'm calling late.

804
01:24:58,844 --> 01:25:02,236
We have proof that 
Rubens was arrested.

805
01:25:07,769 --> 01:25:10,669
I think there's still time for a swim.
Anyone?

806
01:25:11,148 --> 01:25:13,148
It's kind of late. I'm hungry.

807
01:25:13,191 --> 01:25:16,727
Zezé, no need to cook.
We're going for ice cream.

808
01:25:17,779 --> 01:25:18,946
- Look at this.
- Any chocolate?

809
01:25:19,065 --> 01:25:20,665
- C'mon, Marcelo.
- I want French fries.

810
01:25:21,567 --> 01:25:23,034
 I want a strawberry sundae.

811
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:51,520
Mom!

812
01:25:54,483 --> 01:25:55,483
Mom!

813
01:26:00,322 --> 01:26:03,055
"Died in combat", Médici said.
That's all.

814
01:26:12,834 --> 01:26:14,434
Can you publish that?

815
01:26:17,130 --> 01:26:18,130
No. Not yet.

816
01:26:19,283 --> 01:26:21,750
They won't admit it officially.

817
01:26:25,055 --> 01:26:29,163
We have to talk to Lino.
He'll know what to do.

818
01:26:31,228 --> 01:26:33,761
There's nothing we can do now, Eunice.

819
01:26:34,356 --> 01:26:35,716
What do you mean?

820
01:26:37,442 --> 01:26:43,258
We have to force them to admit it publicly.
A subpoena, a court order.

821
01:26:43,865 --> 01:26:47,385
We think we need to continue
to ask for Rubens' release.

822
01:26:49,413 --> 01:26:51,946
As if we didn't know
nothing about him.

823
01:26:52,332 --> 01:26:53,332
What?

824
01:26:55,377 --> 01:26:58,769
To have someone parked outside
my house all day long?

825
01:27:00,882 --> 01:27:03,416
So my phone will keep on
being tapped?

826
01:27:10,809 --> 01:27:12,169
You're not alone.

827
01:27:21,462 --> 01:27:22,502
What about the body?

828
01:27:26,533 --> 01:27:28,400
I have nothing more to say.

829
01:27:30,078 --> 01:27:32,145
But what do you think they did?

830
01:27:37,002 --> 01:27:38,302
Say it.

831
01:27:38,503 --> 01:27:39,937
I've heard it all, Eunice.

832
01:27:40,547 --> 01:27:45,475
They bury in the forest, dropped into
the sea from a helicopter, mass graves.

833
01:27:47,554 --> 01:27:51,714
It's all rumors. There's no way
to know, 'cause nobody will talk.

834
01:27:51,909 --> 01:27:54,009
They're afraid of disappearing, too.

835
01:28:03,028 --> 01:28:05,428
Do you mind if I don't
walk you out?

836
01:28:10,827 --> 01:28:15,091
I'm sorry, I wish I were
the bearer of better news.

837
01:28:15,707 --> 01:28:16,707
I know.

838
01:28:30,514 --> 01:28:31,714
Bye, bye, guys.

839
01:28:33,300 --> 01:28:34,300
What were you talking about?

840
01:28:35,685 --> 01:28:37,977
I came to bring something for
your mother, that's all.

841
01:28:38,205 --> 01:28:39,905
Did you find out where
my Dad is?

842
01:28:40,273 --> 01:28:42,607
Not yet. Take care, okay?

843
01:28:50,158 --> 01:28:51,198
So boring.

844
01:28:51,702 --> 01:28:53,935
You're boring, go play
with your doll.

845
01:28:54,329 --> 01:28:56,129
- You stupid.
- Oh, Marcelo?

846
01:28:59,709 --> 01:29:00,709
Mom?

847
01:29:02,212 --> 01:29:03,212
What, sweetie?

848
01:29:03,839 --> 01:29:05,772
Mommy, Marcelo broke my doll.

849
01:29:06,049 --> 01:29:07,169
Sit down here.

850
01:29:16,601 --> 01:29:17,881
Were you crying?

851
01:29:19,854 --> 01:29:20,854
No.

852
01:29:24,985 --> 01:29:25,985
I fixed.

853
01:29:28,872 --> 01:29:30,672
Shall we have some ice cream?

854
01:29:30,782 --> 01:29:33,515
- Yeah.
- Tell your siblings to get ready.

855
01:29:39,332 --> 01:29:40,332
- You?
- P.

856
01:29:44,713 --> 01:29:45,713
G.

857
01:29:53,597 --> 01:29:54,597
- S?
- No.

858
01:29:56,933 --> 01:29:58,933
- Say, Babiu.
- R?

859
01:31:36,533 --> 01:31:37,573
Are you sure?

860
01:31:41,663 --> 01:31:46,143
If you wait till the deed is in order,
we can get a much better price.

861
01:31:46,751 --> 01:31:50,595
I've got too much to do.
I prefer it this way.

862
01:31:51,339 --> 01:31:53,239
I can loan you money,
that's no trouble.

863
01:31:54,467 --> 01:31:58,883
That piece of land is a gem, and
you can still build the house there.

864
01:32:05,645 --> 01:32:09,165
Thanks for managing to sell it
without the proper papers

865
01:32:15,155 --> 01:32:16,155
I'm sorry.

866
01:32:20,910 --> 01:32:22,777
I wish I could've done more.

867
01:32:28,543 --> 01:32:30,223
It wasn't your fault.

868
01:32:31,546 --> 01:32:38,474
If you need anything, anything at all,
for you or for the kids, just tell me.

869
01:32:42,766 --> 01:32:43,766
Of course.

870
01:32:48,146 --> 01:32:50,679
- Is that a deposit?
- It's withdrawal.

871
01:33:06,706 --> 01:33:07,706
Thanks.

872
01:33:31,356 --> 01:33:32,556
- Hi Zezé.
- Hi.

873
01:33:33,608 --> 01:33:35,475
- Can I come in?
- Of course.

874
01:34:23,074 --> 01:34:24,074
Lass?

875
01:34:48,766 --> 01:34:52,300
I missed you.
You've grown up.

876
01:34:53,855 --> 01:34:56,799
- Hi, honey. I missed you.
- Me, too. So much.

877
01:34:59,777 --> 01:35:01,911
Do you know that
Pimpão has died?

878
01:35:02,280 --> 01:35:03,960
- What?
- The dog.

879
01:35:04,574 --> 01:35:05,774
Ah, poor puppy.

880
01:35:06,367 --> 01:35:10,015
- Can I keep the brooch?
- Of course. As many as you want.

881
01:35:10,355 --> 01:35:12,088
Where are Nalu and Eliana?

882
01:35:12,665 --> 01:35:15,213
They stayed home to wait for
the reporters from <i>Manchete</i>.

883
01:35:15,510 --> 01:35:17,682
What do the staff of this
magazine want at home?

884
01:35:17,763 --> 01:35:20,863
They'll take a family photo
for the next edition, honey.

885
01:35:28,306 --> 01:35:31,039
Look, I'll work some magic.
Pay attention.

886
01:35:33,603 --> 01:35:34,603
Mom.

887
01:35:35,939 --> 01:35:36,939
What, honey?

888
01:35:38,483 --> 01:35:40,283
I left your coat in London.

889
01:35:40,485 --> 01:35:43,877
Helena insisted on keeping it.
So, I left it with her.

890
01:35:45,073 --> 01:35:46,073
All right.

891
01:35:47,242 --> 01:35:49,222
- Really?
- Yeah.

892
01:35:50,995 --> 01:35:53,862
She'll need the coat more
than me in London.

893
01:35:55,959 --> 01:35:57,639
Are you all right, Mom?

894
01:35:59,087 --> 01:36:00,820
I am, honey.
I'm all right.

895
01:36:03,049 --> 01:36:04,329
Have you heard any news?

896
01:36:04,676 --> 01:36:05,676
Verinha.

897
01:36:07,671 --> 01:36:10,551
In London, it's in all the papers.
Hasn't this been published anywhere?

898
01:36:10,590 --> 01:36:11,590
Sweetie!

899
01:36:17,563 --> 01:36:19,571
Get be closer, get closer
to each other, please.

900
01:36:20,275 --> 01:36:24,243
- Is everyone in the picture?
- Yes. Get closer to each other.

901
01:36:24,562 --> 01:36:25,562
Closer. Yeah.

902
01:36:26,306 --> 01:36:27,306
Ready?

903
01:36:27,907 --> 01:36:30,207
Let's go.
Three, two, one…

904
01:36:31,536 --> 01:36:32,716
You don't have to smile.

905
01:36:33,329 --> 01:36:34,329
Why not?

906
01:36:34,914 --> 01:36:37,281
- The editor asked for it.
- For what?

907
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:39,833
He asked for a photo that's more...

908
01:36:40,878 --> 01:36:42,398
A photo less happy.

909
01:36:43,548 --> 01:36:45,068
He wants a sad one?

910
01:36:46,759 --> 01:36:49,891
No, he doesn't want a sad one.
He wants a photo without smiling.

911
01:36:50,471 --> 01:36:51,991
He wants a sad one.

912
01:36:52,682 --> 01:36:54,122
We going to smile.

913
01:36:55,601 --> 01:36:56,601
Smile.

914
01:36:56,954 --> 01:36:59,126
How about serious?
Can we get serious for a second?

915
01:37:00,390 --> 01:37:01,390
Smile.

916
01:37:01,566 --> 01:37:03,006
Look here, please.

917
01:37:03,651 --> 01:37:04,651
Smile!

918
01:37:05,111 --> 01:37:06,111
Three, two, one.

919
01:37:08,072 --> 01:37:09,072
Another one.

920
01:37:14,495 --> 01:37:16,229
<i>I really don't understand,</i>

921
01:37:17,582 --> 01:37:24,278
<i>how in a country with a allegedly
functioning justice system,</i>

922
01:37:24,881 --> 01:37:32,277
<i>someone break into my house, take my
husband, a family father, an engineer away.</i>

923
01:37:32,555 --> 01:37:35,755
Throw him in jail, and
then simply say "he's gone".

924
01:37:36,976 --> 01:37:39,709
<i>The inquiry was recently
archived, right?</i>

925
01:37:41,731 --> 01:37:44,598
My lawyer has filed a request
to reopen it.

926
01:37:46,819 --> 01:37:50,183
<i>It is unacceptable for the State
to act in this way,</i>

927
01:37:50,365 --> 01:37:52,665
<i>which is protected by a
system of false news</i>

928
01:37:53,367 --> 01:37:58,791
<i>designed to cover up the unlawful
acts committed by its own agents.</i>

929
01:38:02,936 --> 01:38:03,976
Is Zezé off today?

930
01:38:04,296 --> 01:38:06,296
She doesn't work here anymore.

931
01:38:06,714 --> 01:38:09,048
- Why?
- We can't afford to pay her.

932
01:38:10,218 --> 01:38:12,351
She works at Dalal's school now.

933
01:38:13,096 --> 01:38:14,776
Let me help you, then.

934
01:38:15,431 --> 01:38:18,503
No need. Tomorrow you can
start on the rotation.

935
01:38:21,437 --> 01:38:23,704
Let me get the dishes for you
today, Eliana.

936
01:38:24,357 --> 01:38:25,477
If you insist.

937
01:38:28,361 --> 01:38:29,361
How are you?

938
01:38:33,809 --> 01:38:37,009
I heard that they took
you along with Mom.

939
01:38:37,912 --> 01:38:39,948
Eliana, what's going on?
Nobody tells me anything.

940
01:38:40,540 --> 01:38:42,740
We can't talk about that at home.

941
01:38:43,067 --> 01:38:46,459
I wish I could've made a
welcome-home soufflé, honey.

942
01:38:47,213 --> 01:38:48,213
No need.

943
01:38:48,673 --> 01:38:51,473
But there was no time.
Shall we have lunch?

944
01:38:52,260 --> 01:38:55,620
What are we going to do that
Veroca is back, now? I'm in her room.

945
01:38:56,097 --> 01:38:57,137
I don't care.

946
01:38:57,473 --> 01:39:00,207
Eliana can stay with
Marcelo and Babiu...

947
01:39:00,977 --> 01:39:03,377
- No way.
- But you're already there.

948
01:39:04,939 --> 01:39:08,331
There's stuff in another room,
I can't put it in mine.

949
01:39:08,484 --> 01:39:10,684
Hey, there's no point in arguing.

950
01:39:12,029 --> 01:39:14,541
Nobody's going to have a
room of their own anymore.

951
01:39:14,699 --> 01:39:15,739
- Why?
- What?

952
01:39:17,952 --> 01:39:19,952
We're going back to São Paulo.

953
01:39:20,621 --> 01:39:22,301
- What?
- Are you serious?

954
01:39:22,582 --> 01:39:23,582
Yes, I am.

955
01:39:24,750 --> 01:39:28,750
Grandma and Grandpa
are there, and your cousins.

956
01:39:29,881 --> 01:39:32,547
And you can stay with them now and then.

957
01:39:33,217 --> 01:39:35,484
Because I'm going back to college.

958
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:37,400
- What?
- I'm not going.

959
01:39:37,972 --> 01:39:39,652
- Eliana.
- I'm not going.

960
01:39:40,308 --> 01:39:41,988
What about the new house?

961
01:39:42,643 --> 01:39:44,443
It'll have to wait a little,
sweetie.

962
01:39:45,062 --> 01:39:46,262
What about Dad?

963
01:39:48,483 --> 01:39:51,216
Your Dad is a long process
to understand.

964
01:39:53,146 --> 01:39:56,370
I know it's hard to understand, but
you'll just have to be patient.

965
01:39:56,449 --> 01:39:59,497
And what if he comes back and
we're not here anymore, Mom?

966
01:40:00,036 --> 01:40:04,324
This house is already rented out.
It's going to become a restaurant.

967
01:40:06,375 --> 01:40:10,067
I want each of you to pack your
things, and on Friday,

968
01:40:10,671 --> 01:40:13,205
a moving truck
will pull up out front.

969
01:40:13,799 --> 01:40:15,399
We're going back to São Paulo.

970
01:40:24,936 --> 01:40:26,669
Marcelo, hand me the salt.

971
01:41:55,451 --> 01:41:56,731
- Bye, Wooden leg.
- Bye, João.

972
01:41:59,155 --> 01:42:00,355
Bye, Luquinhas.

973
01:42:06,579 --> 01:42:09,479
- Keep this for me?
- You'll be back, rascal?

974
01:43:01,517 --> 01:43:06,084
How did you find it?
Only Daddy knew.

975
01:43:07,765 --> 01:43:11,098
I know a lot of things, too.

976
01:43:12,103 --> 01:43:13,103
Let's go.

977
01:43:15,022 --> 01:43:16,822
Nalu, have you seen Eliana?

978
01:43:16,941 --> 01:43:17,941
No.

979
01:43:24,865 --> 01:43:25,865
Eliana?

980
01:43:29,704 --> 01:43:30,704
Eliana?

981
01:43:36,419 --> 01:43:37,419
Eliana!

982
01:43:45,177 --> 01:43:46,177
Eliana?

983
01:43:53,227 --> 01:43:54,227
Sweetie?

984
01:46:00,980 --> 01:46:03,300
25 YEARS LATER

985
01:47:39,536 --> 01:47:40,576
CLASS OF 1977

986
01:47:53,634 --> 01:47:54,994
You got in early.

987
01:47:55,736 --> 01:47:58,969
Hi, honey. I rescheduled my flight.

988
01:47:59,848 --> 01:48:00,848
That's good.

989
01:48:02,059 --> 01:48:05,067
I'm going to eat out with Daniel.
Do you want to come?

990
01:48:05,270 --> 01:48:08,726
I can't, Babiu. I'll just heat
something up. Thank you.

991
01:48:14,488 --> 01:48:15,768
Was that recent?

992
01:48:18,492 --> 01:48:20,692
I can't handle you in those little
airplanes.

993
01:48:20,911 --> 01:48:21,911
By land, it's impossible.

994
01:48:23,247 --> 01:48:27,343
It takes three days and the area
is swarming with land grabbers.

995
01:48:27,960 --> 01:48:30,626
I thought you kicked
them out last time.

996
01:48:31,213 --> 01:48:32,213
Me, too.

997
01:48:35,660 --> 01:48:37,460
When do you leave tomorrow?

998
01:48:38,078 --> 01:48:40,345
Manuela will pick me up at six-forty.

999
01:48:40,565 --> 01:48:42,532
I haven't even started
 preparing my speech.

1000
01:48:43,100 --> 01:48:45,592
I'll wake up early so we can
have breakfast together.

1001
01:48:55,446 --> 01:49:00,502
The legal tools we have to try to prevent
the illegal occupation of these areas,

1002
01:49:01,368 --> 01:49:05,144
and the entire region affected by
the Transamazonian highway, are:

1003
01:49:06,540 --> 01:49:11,520
First, file for the annulment of fraudulent
contracts by land grabbers,

1004
01:49:13,088 --> 01:49:15,755
which Manuela and I did for the Pataxós.

1005
01:49:17,092 --> 01:49:19,626
Second, enforce the 1988's Constitution,

1006
01:49:21,055 --> 01:49:25,919
it requires the State to guarantee
 Indigenous peoples' rights to their land.

1007
01:49:26,727 --> 01:49:28,494
There's an urgent phone call for you.

1008
01:49:31,648 --> 01:49:32,648
Hello?

1009
01:49:54,338 --> 01:49:56,804
Couldn't you comb your hair, Marcelo?

1010
01:49:57,090 --> 01:49:58,957
I already put on a tie, Mom.

1011
01:50:02,638 --> 01:50:04,771
Do you have the documents there?

1012
01:50:04,890 --> 01:50:05,890
Yes.

1013
01:50:09,561 --> 01:50:11,361
- Good morning, Marlon.
- Excuse me.

1014
01:50:12,715 --> 01:50:15,915
Let me introduce you my
children. Marcelo and Beatriz.

1015
01:50:17,402 --> 01:50:19,202
And your little one?
Is he fine?

1016
01:50:19,446 --> 01:50:21,446
- He's fine and back at school.
- That's great.

1017
01:50:21,557 --> 01:50:23,024
- Give Ivone my best.
- Sure.

1018
01:50:23,242 --> 01:50:25,108
And ma'am, congratulations.

1019
01:50:28,956 --> 01:50:30,156
C'mon, Marcelo.

1020
01:50:31,283 --> 01:50:32,963
- So is it really here?
- Yes, ma'am.

1021
01:50:33,877 --> 01:50:36,449
Cristiane, can you get
Mrs. Eunice file, please?

1022
01:50:37,005 --> 01:50:38,685
- Yes, I can.
- Thank you.

1023
01:50:45,615 --> 01:50:48,631
Marcelo, sorry to bother, but when
your mom said you'd be coming in...

1024
01:50:49,268 --> 01:50:52,068
- Do you mind signing it?
- Yeah, of course.

1025
01:50:52,813 --> 01:50:55,013
- It's Carla, right?
- Yes, Carla.

1026
01:50:55,983 --> 01:50:58,249
- Did you like it?
- I cried a lot.

1027
01:50:58,386 --> 01:50:59,386
Really?

1028
01:51:00,404 --> 01:51:02,270
It was supposed to be funny.

1029
01:51:02,823 --> 01:51:05,223
The story of your accident moved me.

1030
01:51:06,027 --> 01:51:07,047
<i>HAPPY OLD YEAR</i>

1031
01:51:07,661 --> 01:51:09,528
Was there too much swearing?

1032
01:51:10,330 --> 01:51:11,330
- No?
- No.

1033
01:51:11,907 --> 01:51:15,811
See? She's the only one who gets on
my case about my language.

1034
01:51:26,538 --> 01:51:28,905
DEATH CERTIFICATE
RUBENS BEYRODT PAIVA

1035
01:51:41,361 --> 01:51:44,561
The press is here, Mrs. Eunice.
Can I let them up?

1036
01:51:45,824 --> 01:51:46,824
Yes.

1037
01:51:48,735 --> 01:51:53,503
It's weird to feel relief
with a death certificate.

1038
01:51:54,708 --> 01:51:58,036
How did you deal with the void
left by your husband?

1039
01:51:59,796 --> 01:52:03,936
Forced disappearances were one of
the regime's cruelest acts.

1040
01:52:05,636 --> 01:52:10,884
A person is killed, and this condemn all
the rest to eternal psychological torture.

1041
01:52:11,475 --> 01:52:14,739
Don't you think that after
the return of democracy,

1042
01:52:15,020 --> 01:52:18,860
the government have more
urgent issues than fixing the past?

1043
01:52:19,650 --> 01:52:23,742
No. I think it's necessary
to compensate the families.

1044
01:52:24,404 --> 01:52:26,208
And do the most important thing:

1045
01:52:26,823 --> 01:52:30,609
Clarify and judge all crimes
committed during the dictatorship.

1046
01:52:31,161 --> 01:52:34,937
Otherwise, they will continue to be
committed with impunity.

1047
01:52:38,085 --> 01:52:39,085
A picture!

1048
01:52:49,179 --> 01:52:50,479
Mom, not the cheap stuff, eh?

1049
01:52:52,516 --> 01:52:53,556
Is this good?

1050
01:52:53,934 --> 01:52:56,334
After the third round,
who can notices it?

1051
01:53:00,315 --> 01:53:02,715
Now that this is finally over, how
about you get retirement?

1052
01:53:02,943 --> 01:53:04,843
- Retirement, Marcelo?
- Take a break.

1053
01:53:05,570 --> 01:53:08,070
Come visit me and Daniel
in Bern, take a little rest.

1054
01:53:08,949 --> 01:53:11,082
The rest I want is on the beach.

1055
01:53:11,493 --> 01:53:12,693
Then go for it.

1056
01:53:15,622 --> 01:53:16,902
Mom, you did it.

1057
01:53:28,252 --> 01:53:29,532
The rum is good.

1058
01:53:29,820 --> 01:53:31,500
- It's good.
- I told you.

1059
01:53:33,131 --> 01:53:35,498
- You're not opening that now.
- I'm already opening it.

1060
01:53:35,726 --> 01:53:40,018
- No, I still have to organize this mess.
- The paper asked for a photo of Dad.

1061
01:53:41,940 --> 01:53:45,140
I'll call Vera. The kids
must be back from school.

1062
01:53:45,152 --> 01:53:47,685
- Send my love.
- And my best to Jorge.

1063
01:53:53,452 --> 01:53:55,132
Look, Pimpão and Zezé.

1064
01:53:58,040 --> 01:54:00,040
Do you remember when that was?

1065
01:54:02,294 --> 01:54:04,294
Was the on... Nalu's birthday?

1066
01:54:05,964 --> 01:54:08,164
No, Dalva and Gaspa aren't in it.

1067
01:54:12,813 --> 01:54:14,493
You, me and Daddy.

1068
01:54:28,528 --> 01:54:30,208
When did you bury him?

1069
01:54:32,892 --> 01:54:34,252
What do you mean?

1070
01:54:38,246 --> 01:54:41,113
The day you realized he
wasn't coming back?

1071
01:54:49,257 --> 01:54:52,521
I think it was when I saw Mom
donating his clothes.

1072
01:54:54,012 --> 01:54:56,012
About a year and a half later.

1073
01:54:56,848 --> 01:54:57,848
Really?

1074
01:55:02,062 --> 01:55:03,262
What about you?

1075
01:55:06,274 --> 01:55:08,408
I think it was when we left Rio.

1076
01:55:09,486 --> 01:55:10,486
That soon?

1077
01:55:12,781 --> 01:55:13,781
I think so.

1078
01:55:15,909 --> 01:55:17,709
Seeing the house all empty.

1079
01:55:26,086 --> 01:55:27,686
Vera sends her love.

1080
01:55:29,464 --> 01:55:31,364
Shall we take a photo
for your sisters?

1081
01:55:32,008 --> 01:55:33,008
Yup.

1082
01:55:33,160 --> 01:55:34,280
- When was that?
- That?

1083
01:55:40,058 --> 01:55:42,125
I think it was Vera's birthday.

1084
01:55:48,542 --> 01:55:50,075
Did you teach her how
to use the timer?

1085
01:55:50,485 --> 01:55:51,485
We're about to find out.

1086
01:55:58,034 --> 01:55:59,034
Smile.

1087
01:56:26,771 --> 01:56:28,451
Do you need help, Mom?

1088
01:56:30,775 --> 01:56:33,175
Check it, I think it's all in order.

1089
01:56:35,030 --> 01:56:37,574
As soon as I get the grant,
I'll pay you back.

1090
01:56:37,908 --> 01:56:39,588
It's all set out here.

1091
01:56:41,161 --> 01:56:44,494
Let's go, I don't want to
get stuck in traffic.

1092
01:56:45,582 --> 01:56:47,582
Mom, you really don't need to.

1093
01:56:49,144 --> 01:56:51,144
- Daniel's coming to pick me up.
- Oh, okay.

1094
01:57:05,018 --> 01:57:06,018
Call me when you get in?

1095
01:57:07,463 --> 01:57:08,463
I will.

1096
01:57:09,281 --> 01:57:11,181
Are you going to see the doctor?

1097
01:57:11,258 --> 01:57:12,558
No.

1098
01:57:16,279 --> 01:57:17,399
I'll miss you.

1099
01:57:20,825 --> 01:57:21,945
Me too, honey.

1100
01:57:24,955 --> 01:57:25,995
Go get ready.

Blow a kiss to Daddy.

You not.
Joaquim.

1108
02:02:16,313 --> 02:02:19,481
Marcelo, I have the one
from <i>Manchete</i>, the one at the beach...

1109
02:02:20,458 --> 02:02:22,525
I think I have the ones from college.

1110
02:02:22,669 --> 02:02:25,202
And from Brasília, are there any left?

1111
02:02:25,463 --> 02:02:28,407
I don't think so. None survived.

1112
02:02:29,300 --> 02:02:33,948
- But there’s the one with the pigeons.
- That one it's great for the cover.

1113
02:02:33,972 --> 02:02:35,272
That's up to the publisher.

1114
02:02:35,682 --> 02:02:38,454
I'll check what I have, scan
and send it to you.

1115
02:02:38,810 --> 02:02:41,418
Eliana, put them on a
pen drive for me, please.

1116

The soufflé!

1117
02:02:46,192 --> 02:02:50,800
Guys, a total failure, it deflated.
Watch out, it's hot. No jokes, okay?

1118
02:02:56,536 --> 02:02:58,603
A sorry sight, eh, Mrs. Eunice?

1119
02:02:58,755 --> 02:03:01,387
- If Mrs. Eunice had left the recipe...
- It's Mom's fault now.

1120
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:06,300
Are you satisfied? Babiu brought
your chocolate ice cream.

1121
02:03:08,640 --> 02:03:09,840
Chico? Do you want to, right?

1122
02:03:11,593 --> 02:03:13,526
- I want it.
- I want it, too.

1123
02:03:14,637 --> 02:03:15,637
Joca.

1124
02:03:22,562 --> 02:03:26,722
- ...In the holiday, we've talked about it.
- When is the holiday?

1125
02:04:28,878 --> 02:04:31,745
- Raquel, can you bring Mom? Please.
- Okay.

1126
02:04:38,096 --> 02:04:39,096
It's here.

1127
02:04:41,015 --> 02:04:42,615
You'll get me drunk.

1128
02:04:44,344 --> 02:04:45,344
Thank you.

1129
02:04:45,979 --> 02:04:49,307
Mom seems less irritated,
doesn't she? She's calmer.

1130
02:04:50,274 --> 02:04:53,741
Yeah. I think so.
Joaquim does her good.

1131
02:04:54,638 --> 02:04:57,718
We've been together for four months,
but I don't know if we're dating.

1132
02:04:57,866 --> 02:05:00,066
Juca said she has the
best kiss in the town.

1133
02:05:00,827 --> 02:05:02,893
- What, Juca?
- It's a criteria.

1134
02:05:06,040 --> 02:05:08,752
- What do you mean, man?
- Did you have a date with this girl?

1135
02:05:08,935 --> 02:05:11,002
No. I'm joking.
It was just him.

1136
02:05:11,629 --> 02:05:13,362
Tell me how she spent
this week.

1137
02:05:14,006 --> 02:05:18,422
There are days when she's fine.
There are days when she's out of mind.

1138
02:05:26,703 --> 02:05:32,307
<i>...Twenty one years of military regime

1140
02:05:35,403 --> 02:05:38,603

<i>Such as Marambaia, in Rio de Janeiro.</i>

1147
02:06:09,145 --> 02:06:14,637
<i>Some of these victims became icons of
resistance against the military regime,</i>

1148

Joaquim, where are you?

1157
02:07:42,488 --> 02:07:44,221
Okay, get ready, everyone.
