1
00:04:37,186 --> 00:04:39,552
Lucy, what is it?

2
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:44,023
Look, it's Jesus!
Where are they going?

3
00:04:45,629 --> 00:04:47,995
Look, look. It's coming down.

4
00:05:13,224 --> 00:05:16,785
What's going on with that statue?
Where are you taking it?

5
00:05:21,034 --> 00:05:25,402
- What?
- Where are you taking it?

6
00:05:29,277 --> 00:05:30,471
To the pope,

7
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,404
They're taking it to the pope!

8
00:05:37,252 --> 00:05:39,880
They want the phone number. No!

9
00:06:36,884 --> 00:06:39,512
Hey, kid, come here.

10
00:06:40,421 --> 00:06:43,048
Listen, what did they eat
at table 16?

11
00:06:43,424 --> 00:06:45,688
The prince ate snails.

12
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,358
- What kind of wine did they have?
- Soave.

13
00:06:48,563 --> 00:06:53,091
Excuse me, Mr. Giulio, I saw them
myself. They had Valpolicella.

14
00:06:53,301 --> 00:06:55,565
- Hi, Marcello.
- Hi, Pierone.

15
00:06:55,772 --> 00:06:58,969
So snails and Valpolicella.
Giulio, let me take a picture.

16
00:06:59,175 --> 00:07:00,904
It's not possible, my friend.

17
00:07:01,111 --> 00:07:05,479
Why do you give him all that money?
If you want information, I'm always here.

18
00:07:24,704 --> 00:07:28,470
Manager!
Manager, stop that photographer!

19
00:07:31,178 --> 00:07:34,044
- Give me the film!
- Oh, come on. The camera is empty.

20
00:07:34,247 --> 00:07:36,909
Everyone has a right
to their own image.

21
00:07:38,651 --> 00:07:40,846
Can you give me a light?

22
00:07:51,999 --> 00:07:54,967
- Listen, darling, come here.
- Me?

23
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:56,762
- Yes.
- What's the matter?

24
00:07:56,972 --> 00:07:58,530
I must talk to you. Come.

25
00:08:01,644 --> 00:08:03,578
Good evening, how are you?

26
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,477
- Well?
- Sit down.

27
00:08:06,682 --> 00:08:09,947
- Where? There's no chair.
- Squat down.

28
00:08:10,788 --> 00:08:14,018
- Sorry.
- Naughty boy.

29
00:08:14,491 --> 00:08:17,289
- Why?
- Because you're a naughty boy.

30
00:08:17,795 --> 00:08:20,730
And you know what I'll do?
I'll break your little face.

31
00:08:22,067 --> 00:08:26,594
I have to inform the public, it's my job.
After all, it's just a little publicity.

32
00:08:26,805 --> 00:08:30,104
You call that publicity? You got her
in trouble with her husband.

33
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:34,040
Do I worry about your being cuckolded?

34
00:08:34,245 --> 00:08:37,305
- You're not a journalist.
- Great journalism.

35
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:42,677
- Shut up. Don't overdo it.
- You'll kill me.

36
00:08:54,769 --> 00:08:57,203
- Has he arrived?
- No, miss, he didn't show up yet.

37
00:08:57,405 --> 00:09:01,398
When he arrives, tell him he's an idiot.
Give me a whiskey.

38
00:09:04,078 --> 00:09:07,377
I can't believe this place is still open.
It's unbearable!

39
00:09:53,935 --> 00:09:56,528
Good evening, Maddalena.
How are you? Alone?

40
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:59,538
- Would you like to dance?
- No.

41
00:10:01,275 --> 00:10:02,765
Shall we have some vodka?

42
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:06,439
No. Everything's going wrong tonight.
I'm leaving.

43
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:09,514
- May I accompany you?
- Why not.

44
00:10:35,479 --> 00:10:39,415
- Your friends are ready to attack.
- Marcello, where are you going?

45
00:10:39,817 --> 00:10:42,479
- Miss Maddalena!
- Please, leave me alone tonight.

46
00:10:42,854 --> 00:10:46,448
Welcome back. Here she is.
More photogenic than a star!

47
00:10:46,924 --> 00:10:50,189
Every night the same story.
Don't they ever get bored?

48
00:10:50,396 --> 00:10:52,091
Paparazzo, enough!

49
00:10:52,298 --> 00:10:55,289
You should be used to it by now.
You're a public figure.

50
00:10:55,501 --> 00:10:58,834
Marcello, where are you going?
Tell us where you're taking her.

51
00:11:06,647 --> 00:11:06,669
I

52
00:11:13,087 --> 00:11:15,782
I'd like to live in a new city.
Where I don't know anyone.

53
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:17,855
Personally, I like Rome very much.

54
00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:23,361
It's sort of a moderate, tranquil jungle
where one can hide well.

55
00:11:26,201 --> 00:11:29,830
I'd like to hide too, but I can't.
I can't.

56
00:11:33,778 --> 00:11:37,076
- What are we going to do now?
- Take a ride. Stay here.

57
00:11:43,654 --> 00:11:47,214
I'm fed up even with Rome.
I'd like an island.

58
00:11:47,425 --> 00:11:48,824
Buy one.

59
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,388
I thought about it.

60
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:54,421
But then, would I really go there?

61
00:11:55,967 --> 00:11:59,061
You know what your problem is?
You have too much money.

62
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:01,602
And your problem
is you don't have enough.

63
00:12:04,377 --> 00:12:06,401
Meanwhile, here we are,
the two of us.

64
00:12:07,347 --> 00:12:12,250
That's not a problem. We're among
the few people left to be unhappy.

65
00:12:12,453 --> 00:12:15,183
- What happened to you there?
- Nothing.

66
00:12:15,422 --> 00:12:20,086
You shouldn't worry. You're so rich,
if you fall, you'll land on your feet.

67
00:12:20,295 --> 00:12:22,092
- You really think so?
- Oh, yes.

68
00:12:22,898 --> 00:12:25,559
I can't even stand on my feet.

69
00:12:26,101 --> 00:12:29,764
I'd need a sort of charge to stand
on my own that I don't have.

70
00:12:30,439 --> 00:12:34,432
When I make love...
Yes, with love there is this tension.

71
00:12:34,645 --> 00:12:38,205
- Only love gives me strength.
- Long live love, then!

72
00:12:39,815 --> 00:12:42,010
Annamaria, come and look!

73
00:12:42,518 --> 00:12:44,816
That's not a car, it's an apartment.

74
00:12:45,022 --> 00:12:48,752
- Who are you? Liliana?
- No, I'm not Liliana.

75
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,928
- And who are you?
- Good evening.

76
00:12:52,562 --> 00:12:55,395
- Good evening.
- Who are you talking to?

77
00:12:56,232 --> 00:12:57,597
Who's there?

78
00:12:58,101 --> 00:13:01,332
Liliana's not here anymore.
She went to Milan.

79
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,807
Do you want to take a ride with us?

80
00:13:04,009 --> 00:13:06,374
- Me?
- Yes.

81
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:08,245
Come along.

82
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:14,145
This lady is asking if I can go
for a ride with her. Should I?

83
00:13:15,755 --> 00:13:17,814
Let's take a ride with this girl.

84
00:13:18,391 --> 00:13:20,723
What exactly do you want to do?

85
00:13:20,928 --> 00:13:25,331
Nothing. We'll go for a ride and then
we'll take her home. You know her?

86
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,566
No.

87
00:13:28,036 --> 00:13:30,004
At least, I don't think so.

88
00:13:31,473 --> 00:13:33,941
I'm going to eat.
I'll see you there.

89
00:13:34,242 --> 00:13:37,870
- Here they are.
- Turn off the lights, you fanatic!

90
00:13:40,949 --> 00:13:44,009
Get some good money.
These guys are richer than Onassis.

91
00:13:47,289 --> 00:13:48,620
Are you coming with us?

92
00:13:48,825 --> 00:13:52,124
If you could take me home,
I'd appreciate it.

93
00:13:52,662 --> 00:13:55,790
- Are you coming?
- Nope.

94
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:59,165
But I live kind of far.

95
00:14:01,105 --> 00:14:04,302
- Sit in the back. Can you fit?
- Yes. Thanks.

96
00:14:05,643 --> 00:14:07,337
- Are you okay there?
- Yes, yes.

97
00:14:07,544 --> 00:14:09,705
- Bye, hon!
- Bye, Annamaria.

98
00:14:09,913 --> 00:14:12,245
- Where do you live?
- At Cessati Spiriti.

99
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:27,226
- Whose car is this? Is it yours?
- Yes.

100
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:30,994
- Did you buy it for her?
- Her father.

101
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:34,974
My goodness! All my father
gave me were beatings.

102
00:14:35,176 --> 00:14:38,372
- Do you know my father?
- You introduced him to me once.

103
00:14:39,247 --> 00:14:42,148
And where do your parents live?

104
00:14:42,551 --> 00:14:44,212
- In Cesena.
- By the sea?

105
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,478
No.

106
00:14:47,289 --> 00:14:49,348
Well, how's it going?

107
00:14:49,758 --> 00:14:52,420
How's it going?
It's going.

108
00:14:54,064 --> 00:14:55,929
Things didn't go well tonight?

109
00:14:56,133 --> 00:15:00,569
Some hypocrite gave me 1000 lira
and a pack of smokes.

110
00:15:01,336 --> 00:15:02,860
Was he young or old?

111
00:15:03,073 --> 00:15:05,769
Who knows?
I didn't look him in the face.

112
00:15:10,848 --> 00:15:13,078
Would you go with a woman
like this one?

113
00:15:13,284 --> 00:15:14,615
No.

114
00:15:15,019 --> 00:15:18,317
Why?
She's not worse than many others.

115
00:15:18,756 --> 00:15:20,849
You don't go with these
kind of women?

116
00:15:21,058 --> 00:15:22,423
Yes, sometimes.

117
00:15:24,897 --> 00:15:28,855
Listen here, Gregory Peck,
I'm not getting any of this stuff.

118
00:15:29,067 --> 00:15:30,625
What are we doing?

119
00:15:30,837 --> 00:15:33,931
- Didn't you say you wanted to go home?
- Yes.

120
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,608
So we're taking you home.

121
00:15:37,343 --> 00:15:42,975
- Why? What did you think?
- Me? Nothing. I wasn't thinking a thing.

122
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:55,188
Let's be quiet. Everyone's
sleeping here. Turn off that radio.

123
00:15:55,398 --> 00:15:56,695
We're leaving anyway.

124
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:59,293
Who do you live with?
Is someone home?

125
00:15:59,503 --> 00:16:02,666
- What's she saying?
- Lf someone is home.

126
00:16:02,873 --> 00:16:06,036
No, my cousin's in Velletri
for a checkup and...

127
00:16:06,342 --> 00:16:08,741
So will you offer us a cup of coffee?

128
00:16:09,778 --> 00:16:12,440
Sure. I can make good coffee.

129
00:16:19,622 --> 00:16:22,523
I hope you're not expecting
to find a palace.

130
00:16:23,427 --> 00:16:25,258
I'll show you the way.

131
00:16:54,696 --> 00:16:56,323
The coffee.

132
00:17:00,067 --> 00:17:04,094
Watch out for the stairs.
The other evening this kind man...

133
00:17:04,306 --> 00:17:10,437
Oh, what a mess. It's flooded again.
This is no way to live. Damn it!

134
00:17:11,314 --> 00:17:12,975
Wait there a moment.

135
00:17:13,182 --> 00:17:17,278
The engineer!
He should have been a gravedigger!

136
00:17:17,486 --> 00:17:23,288
That'll be the day.
I've been paying for all the devil's sins!

137
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,625
Come on!

138
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:33,668
Hold on, I'll have you go in the bedroom.
Good God.

139
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:38,732
It's flooded here too. Have a seat
in the bedroom, I'll make you coffee.

140
00:17:38,943 --> 00:17:41,707
I need to know someone important.
That's what I need.

141
00:17:42,214 --> 00:17:45,581
I'm so sorry.
I put in a request two years ago, but...

142
00:17:45,784 --> 00:17:47,842
Don't worry about it.

143
00:17:49,788 --> 00:17:52,780
In the meantime,
I'll make some coffee, okay?

144
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:04,800
Would you close the door?

145
00:18:21,991 --> 00:18:23,754
You want to make love here?

146
00:18:25,329 --> 00:18:26,421
No?

147
00:18:54,126 --> 00:18:56,356
I'll leave your coffee here.

148
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:06,198
You didn't agree on the terms before?
Are you crazy?

149
00:19:06,407 --> 00:19:09,000
Hey, I don't know.
They did everything on their own!

150
00:19:09,209 --> 00:19:10,506
Was I supposed to kick them out?

151
00:19:10,712 --> 00:19:15,376
- Hopefully they'll give me 2000 lira.
- 2000 lira? I set the price around here!

152
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:19,040
- Are they husband and wife?
- Yeah, right.

153
00:19:53,524 --> 00:19:54,957
Here. Many thanks.

154
00:19:55,159 --> 00:19:57,753
Must I back up,
or is there room to turn around?

155
00:19:57,963 --> 00:20:00,726
No. It's easier if you turn right
at the end.

156
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:03,925
Can I give you a little kiss?
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

157
00:20:04,137 --> 00:20:06,799
- Come back when you want!
- Bye.

158
00:20:07,474 --> 00:20:09,373
Don't go speeding with that car, now!

159
00:20:34,002 --> 00:20:36,835
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God!

160
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,106
Emma.

161
00:21:11,809 --> 00:21:13,834
Emma! Emma!

162
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:17,975
Emma, what's wrong?
Answer me, what happened?

163
00:21:26,227 --> 00:21:30,322
What did you do?
What did you do, you crazy fool?

164
00:21:45,081 --> 00:21:46,548
Emma!

165
00:21:47,483 --> 00:21:52,545
It's nothing. Stay calm!
I'll take you to the hospital.

166
00:21:52,822 --> 00:21:55,290
Why, I ask?
Why are you so crazy?

167
00:21:55,826 --> 00:21:59,193
Do you...
Do you want to ruin me, huh?

168
00:21:59,396 --> 00:22:03,389
One of these days I'll just let you die.
I'll let you die!

169
00:22:06,504 --> 00:22:09,904
Emma, answer me.
Stop it now.

170
00:22:19,717 --> 00:22:22,413
Emma, honey...

171
00:22:23,155 --> 00:22:25,919
My love. Emma.

172
00:22:31,431 --> 00:22:32,830
Hurry!

173
00:22:44,178 --> 00:22:47,375
Rubini! Did you bring that woman
who poisoned herself?

174
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:50,346
Giannelli, do me a favor,
don't write anything.

175
00:22:50,551 --> 00:22:52,815
I'll be in trouble with the police.

176
00:22:53,054 --> 00:22:54,783
- What happened?
- Nothing.

177
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:58,756
- What is her name?
- I can't tell you. Leave me alone, please.

178
00:22:59,562 --> 00:23:01,085
You can come in.

179
00:23:01,831 --> 00:23:03,230
Yes.

180
00:23:13,278 --> 00:23:17,681
- Emma.
- Don't tire her. She needs to rest.

181
00:23:20,418 --> 00:23:22,283
You can take her home
in a couple of hours.

182
00:23:22,487 --> 00:23:25,684
In the meantime, see the brigadier
for the report. It's mandatory.

183
00:23:25,891 --> 00:23:27,756
Emma.

184
00:23:35,969 --> 00:23:41,770
Emma, why did you do it?
Tell me. Why?

185
00:23:53,454 --> 00:23:55,251
The brigadier is waiting for you.

186
00:24:00,161 --> 00:24:01,958
I'll be right back.

187
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:15,469
Wait there, please,
he'll be right with you.

188
00:24:28,361 --> 00:24:31,625
- Sister, can I use the phone?
- Sure, go ahead.

189
00:25:25,622 --> 00:25:29,422
- You come here. Come down!
- I just want to take one picture!

190
00:25:29,627 --> 00:25:30,594
Get your hands off me!

191
00:25:31,461 --> 00:25:34,828
Sylvia! Sylvia!

192
00:25:43,075 --> 00:25:45,976
Your glasses! Your glasses!

193
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:54,019
Take your glasses off!

194
00:25:54,821 --> 00:25:56,550
No! Go! Go back.

195
00:26:13,941 --> 00:26:15,966
Sylvia, take your glasses off!

196
00:26:29,592 --> 00:26:31,286
Come on, smile!

197
00:26:36,233 --> 00:26:38,167
Do we give her the flowers first
or the pizza?

198
00:26:38,369 --> 00:26:40,769
- The pizza!
- Be careful not to drop it!

199
00:26:41,505 --> 00:26:43,803
Please bring your luggage
to customs,

200
00:26:44,542 --> 00:26:47,272
Hurry up with this pizza,
you morons!

201
00:26:48,582 --> 00:26:51,312
Stand back, stand back.

202
00:26:52,885 --> 00:26:54,443
He's here...

203
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:57,350
The producer Toto Scalise
has just arrived.

204
00:26:57,557 --> 00:27:02,357
He's cast the star for a historic joint
production which will be shot in color...

205
00:27:02,561 --> 00:27:03,926
Is that the Swedish woman?

206
00:27:04,129 --> 00:27:07,326
Oh, man, I better not see her
or I'll have to kill my wife tonight!

207
00:27:07,533 --> 00:27:09,091
Long live Sweden!

208
00:27:09,602 --> 00:27:12,092
- Offered to the gorgeous
Swedish actress.

209
00:27:12,304 --> 00:27:13,965
Showing her wonderful teeth...

210
00:27:14,173 --> 00:27:17,574
...the beautiful Sylvia bites
into a typical Italian product...

211
00:27:17,778 --> 00:27:22,077
...which, with its colors and its aroma,
is as joyful as our country.

212
00:27:22,617 --> 00:27:25,552
Hi, Marcello.
Great piece of meat, huh?

213
00:27:25,987 --> 00:27:31,118
Toto Scalise is leading the star through
customs. A crowd of fans awaits...

214
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,164
Such a long trip and she's
as fresh as a rose.

215
00:27:43,239 --> 00:27:45,799
Clementelli, go over to customs,
immediately.

216
00:27:58,089 --> 00:28:01,422
- Did you have a good trip?
- Yes, thank you.

217
00:28:01,762 --> 00:28:03,422
What a confusion!

218
00:28:10,603 --> 00:28:10,625
I

219
00:28:20,714 --> 00:28:25,241
- Come on, Marcello, pass him!
- Quit it! There's nowhere to go!

220
00:28:25,452 --> 00:28:27,647
Come on, pass him.
Run him over!

221
00:28:36,231 --> 00:28:39,325
Is it true that every morning
you bathe in ice?

222
00:28:42,939 --> 00:28:45,339
Do you ever practice yoga?

223
00:28:54,384 --> 00:28:58,115
Ask her which Italian historical figure
she would like to play.

224
00:28:58,323 --> 00:29:00,723
Do you like bearded men?

225
00:29:01,326 --> 00:29:05,022
Would you like something to drink?

226
00:29:05,964 --> 00:29:08,797
Ma'am, what do you think
about Italian actresses?

227
00:29:37,297 --> 00:29:40,960
For Cinema Nuovo, do you think
Italian neorealism is dead or alive?

228
00:29:42,103 --> 00:29:44,297
Do you believe in friendship
among peoples?

229
00:30:05,295 --> 00:30:06,887
Come on, with this phone!

230
00:30:07,198 --> 00:30:10,861
No, no. It's that I couldn't
call you before. Thanks.

231
00:30:14,807 --> 00:30:17,503
What do you think I'm doing?
I'm working.

232
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:19,302
Did you take your drops?

233
00:30:19,878 --> 00:30:21,368
Are you alone with her?

234
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:24,377
There are at least 50 people in here!

235
00:30:25,585 --> 00:30:28,418
Swear on your mother's life!
Go on, swear it!

236
00:30:28,621 --> 00:30:30,612
Yes, I swear on my mother.

237
00:30:33,258 --> 00:30:36,694
Beautiful? Well, yes,
if you like American beauty.

238
00:30:36,896 --> 00:30:39,956
She's like a doll, like a big doll.

239
00:31:05,895 --> 00:31:06,884
Yes.

240
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:11,560
Marcello, I'll come over there
and rip your eyes out!

241
00:31:11,936 --> 00:31:15,302
Marcello, why don't you
come here right now?

242
00:31:15,507 --> 00:31:16,906
No, I can't.

243
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:19,670
- I want to make love.
- What?

244
00:31:19,944 --> 00:31:21,309
I want to make love!

245
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:26,516
- Yes, hold on a second.
- Where shall we take her?

246
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:29,243
First to St. Peter's,
then to the Quirinale.

247
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:30,711
Not a bad idea.

248
00:31:34,692 --> 00:31:37,991
Here's our Robert!
Our actress' boyfriend.

249
00:31:47,708 --> 00:31:51,405
- Marcello?
- What is it? Are you going out?

250
00:31:51,612 --> 00:31:55,308
No, no. I'll wait for you here.
I'll stay home all day long.

251
00:31:56,651 --> 00:31:59,745
What would you like to eat?
Something light.

252
00:31:59,955 --> 00:32:02,219
You want a nice plate of ravioli?

253
00:32:02,691 --> 00:32:06,353
I've got everything.
I'll just go downstairs for vegetables.

254
00:32:06,996 --> 00:32:09,965
Then we'll go to the movies,
or we can stay in. As you like.

255
00:32:10,533 --> 00:32:12,933
Marcello, do you love me?

256
00:32:34,692 --> 00:32:36,717
Don't leave her alone!

257
00:33:08,496 --> 00:33:11,056
Wonderful! Let's do another one.
Stop!

258
00:33:15,637 --> 00:33:17,571
She never stops for a minute!

259
00:33:32,823 --> 00:33:36,019
I finished the film.
I'll be right back, okay?

260
00:33:43,302 --> 00:33:47,533
- Hey, where did she go?
- She's an elevator, that one!

261
00:35:37,526 --> 00:35:41,622
You're everything, Sylvia.
You know that you're everything?

262
00:35:45,736 --> 00:35:49,263
You're the first woman of creation.

263
00:35:50,174 --> 00:35:53,371
You're the mother, the sister,
the lover, the friend...

264
00:35:53,577 --> 00:35:56,204
...the angel, the devil,
the Earth, the home.

265
00:35:56,413 --> 00:35:59,746
That's what you are: The home!

266
00:36:02,388 --> 00:36:03,912
Sylvia...

267
00:36:05,757 --> 00:36:08,692
Why did you come here?

268
00:36:08,994 --> 00:36:14,330
Go back to America, please.
What am I supposed to do now?

269
00:36:30,385 --> 00:36:33,377
Oh, our Robert is also a painter.
Bravo!

270
00:36:34,523 --> 00:36:37,389
I must see you.
I must talk to you at all costs.

271
00:36:57,747 --> 00:37:01,581
- Who's that madman?
- Frankie Stout, a divine actor!

272
00:37:54,845 --> 00:37:58,974
- Will you excuse me a moment?
- Go, sweetheart, go!

273
00:38:00,317 --> 00:38:02,717
He's dancing with the lady!

274
00:39:36,956 --> 00:39:38,548
Hi, darling.

275
00:39:48,735 --> 00:39:51,067
- He's a good dancer.
- Sweet as sugar.

276
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:52,1000
Very... Very good, yes.

277
00:39:54,042 --> 00:39:56,567
- You're having banana flambe, huh?
- What else?

278
00:39:56,911 --> 00:39:59,778
- The lady's shoes.
- I'll take them, I'll take them.

279
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:02,779
- I found them...
- That's fine, thank you.

280
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:06,348
Excuse me. One moment.

281
00:40:31,181 --> 00:40:32,307
What do you want?

282
00:42:54,373 --> 00:42:57,171
Bravo! Bravo, Frankie!
You were great!

283
00:42:57,376 --> 00:43:02,312
Bravo! Very good!
Look, you made me cry. Bravo!

284
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:08,886
What class, madam.
You're divine!

285
00:43:09,088 --> 00:43:11,784
Dangerous stuff, but very beautiful.

286
00:43:11,991 --> 00:43:13,754
Thank you, sir!

287
00:43:17,232 --> 00:43:19,756
Marcello, give me the champagne!

288
00:44:11,656 --> 00:44:15,353
I don't know.
I'll bring her back immediately.

289
00:44:15,562 --> 00:44:18,326
Give me the shoes. Let go.
I'll be right back.

290
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:21,897
- Why did she get upset?
- Stay here. I'll take care of it.

291
00:44:22,602 --> 00:44:23,830
Here she is!

292
00:44:25,139 --> 00:44:27,369
- Sylvia, the shoes!
- Marcello, what happened?

293
00:44:27,576 --> 00:44:29,475
Nothing happened.
Go away!

294
00:44:29,677 --> 00:44:31,042
Let's take your scooter.

295
00:44:31,246 --> 00:44:32,645
Marcello, wait for us!

296
00:44:34,749 --> 00:44:36,546
Great idea, Marcello!

297
00:44:37,753 --> 00:44:39,344
Let's take her to Ostia.

298
00:44:44,761 --> 00:44:47,355
Paparazzo, I'm not kidding,
get out of the car!

299
00:44:47,564 --> 00:44:50,589
It'll be an incredible scoop.
I'll give you 50 percent.

300
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,394
I don't give a damn about 50 percent.
Go away!

301
00:44:53,603 --> 00:44:55,127
I'll give you 30 percent.

302
00:44:58,108 --> 00:45:01,565
- Get lost!
- Marcello, tell me where you're going!

303
00:45:03,647 --> 00:45:06,616
He didn't tell me where he's going.
Hurry!

304
00:45:25,939 --> 00:45:27,566
We lost them.

305
00:45:35,583 --> 00:45:37,551
Yes... No... Of course!

306
00:46:46,793 --> 00:46:48,260
What?

307
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:18,055
...it's full of holes there.

308
00:47:36,316 --> 00:47:38,147
We'd better leave now.

309
00:47:41,186 --> 00:47:42,312
Maybe some other time.

310
00:47:47,293 --> 00:47:51,251
Sergio will be back on the 12th.
I'm his mother.

311
00:47:51,464 --> 00:47:55,662
- Do you have the key?
- No, he takes the studio key with him.

312
00:47:55,869 --> 00:47:58,303
I'm his mother. Was this for work?

313
00:47:58,672 --> 00:48:01,538
Yes, madam, it was about a job.

314
00:48:01,742 --> 00:48:03,209
But I'll call...

315
00:48:03,410 --> 00:48:06,106
I'll call back on the 12th.
It doesn't matter.

316
00:48:06,315 --> 00:48:08,749
Sorry to disturb, madam.
Good night.

317
00:48:12,255 --> 00:48:15,418
Excuse me, isn't she
that American actress?

318
00:48:15,625 --> 00:48:17,354
- Yes.
- She's so beautiful!

319
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:18,857
Good night.

320
00:48:29,474 --> 00:48:34,877
I can't bring you home.
That madwoman wouldn't understand.

321
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:37,105
Understand?

322
00:48:37,916 --> 00:48:40,941
Wait a minute.
I've got an idea that maybe...

323
00:48:43,656 --> 00:48:48,719
- Miss, a phone call for you.
- Yes?

324
00:48:49,729 --> 00:48:53,528
Marcello! Are you sure
you didn't dial the wrong number?

325
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:56,762
Listen, Maddalena,
can I come with someone?

326
00:48:57,070 --> 00:49:00,335
- Someone? Who?
- Who calls her at this hour?

327
00:49:01,074 --> 00:49:03,565
Someone... Someone.

328
00:49:04,378 --> 00:49:09,042
- Why, you're not alone?
- I'm playing cards with my father.

329
00:49:11,184 --> 00:49:12,879
Oh, your father's there.

330
00:49:13,354 --> 00:49:14,878
Tell me.

331
00:49:16,190 --> 00:49:17,919
What is it that you want?

332
00:49:18,461 --> 00:49:21,918
Nothing. I'll call you soon.
I apologize. Good night.

333
00:49:36,981 --> 00:49:39,711
Sylvia, what are you doing?

334
00:49:48,695 --> 00:49:51,629
No, dear. Where am I going
to find milk at this hour?

335
00:49:55,602 --> 00:49:58,594
Sylvia!
Where are you going with that cat?

336
00:49:58,805 --> 00:50:00,897
Rome is full of cats, if we start...

337
00:50:01,239 --> 00:50:02,536
Come here! Stop!

338
00:50:05,411 --> 00:50:08,938
You don't know. Wait in the car.
I'll go get it.

339
00:50:11,016 --> 00:50:14,543
I'm going. Get in the car.

340
00:50:23,831 --> 00:50:27,323
Excuse me. Do you know where
I can I buy some milk? Some...

341
00:50:27,536 --> 00:50:29,299
All right, all right. Thanks.

342
00:52:05,277 --> 00:52:08,269
Yes, Sylvia, I'm coming too.

343
00:52:09,315 --> 00:52:10,839
I'm coming too.

344
00:52:15,455 --> 00:52:18,891
Yes, I guess she's right.
I'm making a mistake.

345
00:52:19,093 --> 00:52:21,288
We're all making a mistake!

346
00:52:34,908 --> 00:52:37,638
Sylvia, who are you?

347
00:53:14,553 --> 00:53:15,577
Turn him.

348
00:53:15,789 --> 00:53:20,692
Stay right there. Good.
Don't you move.

349
00:53:20,893 --> 00:53:25,295
- And to think this guy did Tarzan,
- Put him back.

350
00:53:31,304 --> 00:53:33,794
I'll take this one from the mirror.

351
00:53:34,441 --> 00:53:37,706
Stay there. I'll take one while
you're photographing him.

352
00:53:39,647 --> 00:53:41,638
Here they are. Here's Marcello.

353
00:53:44,118 --> 00:53:46,712
- Mr. Robert.
- Not again, guys. Go away.

354
00:53:46,921 --> 00:53:48,149
Hey, wake up!

355
00:53:48,522 --> 00:53:52,617
Mr. Robert. Sylvia! Look!

356
00:53:57,266 --> 00:53:59,791
Marcello, you've got to
give us the details.

357
00:54:00,604 --> 00:54:04,095
- Do me a favor. Leave!
- But I've got to work!

358
00:54:04,307 --> 00:54:06,605
- Enough.
- Get lost, will you?

359
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:09,074
- Enough, please!
- Why is her dress wet?

360
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,544
- Why is it wet, Marcello?
- I don't know!

361
00:54:17,856 --> 00:54:20,120
This will end up in a fight.

362
00:54:46,854 --> 00:54:48,344
Go after her, Mr. Robert.

363
00:54:48,556 --> 00:54:52,754
- How do you say "Go after her"?
- Hurry, it's not over yet.

364
00:55:00,002 --> 00:55:02,732
Marcello, can you fight in English?

365
00:55:09,746 --> 00:55:14,011
- Nice!
- Marcello, hit him too, no?

366
00:55:14,217 --> 00:55:18,176
- Marcello, raise your head a bit.
- Is he leaving already? Mr. Robert.

367
00:55:18,388 --> 00:55:19,753
Marcello, what happened?

368
00:55:25,731 --> 00:55:29,326
Marcello! This one is done.
Now what do I do?

369
00:55:30,401 --> 00:55:33,392
Put the horse on the table
and her on the ground.

370
00:55:40,947 --> 00:55:42,141
I'll be right back.

371
00:55:42,349 --> 00:55:45,283
Do I pick you up at 8 tonight?
Yes or no?

372
00:55:45,485 --> 00:55:49,979
- Boy, you sure are vain.
- I'm not vain, dear. I work.

373
00:56:03,370 --> 00:56:04,564
Steiner.

374
00:56:05,974 --> 00:56:07,771
I thought I saw you come in.

375
00:56:07,976 --> 00:56:10,274
How are you?
What are you doing here?

376
00:56:10,479 --> 00:56:13,606
And you?
I'm so happy to see you again.

377
00:56:15,717 --> 00:56:17,981
Well, I'm kind of at home here.

378
00:56:18,754 --> 00:56:22,451
Father Franz found this book for me.

379
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:26,117
It's an old Sanskrit grammar book.

380
00:56:28,599 --> 00:56:32,763
It's been so long!
How's your book going?

381
00:56:32,970 --> 00:56:36,427
It's going. I'm gathering material.
Actually, I just finished.

382
00:56:36,641 --> 00:56:40,236
I thought I'd let you read it.
And you?

383
00:56:40,445 --> 00:56:44,346
I read one of your recent articles.
I liked it very much.

384
00:56:44,549 --> 00:56:49,043
- No.
- Why? It was fine.

385
00:56:50,290 --> 00:56:53,020
It was vivid, passionate...

386
00:56:53,725 --> 00:56:55,249
...the best of you.

387
00:56:55,460 --> 00:56:59,419
Qualities you insist on hiding
which nonetheless belong to you.

388
00:57:00,133 --> 00:57:02,1000
- I don't think I know how to write.
- I live around here.

389
00:57:03,205 --> 00:57:06,298
Why don't you come
to see me one evening?

390
00:57:07,042 --> 00:57:10,603
- Can you stay another five minutes?
- Sure.

391
00:57:12,915 --> 00:57:15,781
- Father, can I come up with a friend?
- Yes. Sure.

392
00:57:15,984 --> 00:57:18,817
- Are you sure we're not disturbing?
- Not at all. Come on.

393
00:57:19,088 --> 00:57:22,615
As you see, these priests
don't fear the devil.

394
00:57:22,825 --> 00:57:24,189
On the contrary.

395
00:57:25,061 --> 00:57:27,791
They even let me play the organ.

396
00:57:28,798 --> 00:57:31,198
Okay, Steiner, don't be too noisy.

397
00:57:31,401 --> 00:57:34,494
Don't worry.
You'll hear some jazz at the most.

398
00:57:34,705 --> 00:57:38,539
- Couldn't we close the church?
- Lf it's jazz, I like it.

399
00:57:40,676 --> 00:57:43,839
Sorry, I promise I won't do it again.

400
00:57:44,814 --> 00:57:46,406
You want to try, Marcello?

401
00:57:54,392 --> 00:57:56,622
We're not used to hearing
these sounds anymore.

402
00:57:57,729 --> 00:58:00,994
Such a mysterious voice.
It seems to come from inside the Earth.

403
00:58:02,102 --> 00:58:05,400
- What would you like to hear?
- You choose. I trust you.

404
00:59:22,456 --> 00:59:25,856
Where did they say it was?
At the end of a wall?

405
00:59:26,059 --> 00:59:30,257
- Hey, Paparazzo!
- They told me at the 47th kilometer.

406
00:59:33,635 --> 00:59:36,194
- I don't want an egg at this hour!
- Eat it.

407
00:59:36,405 --> 00:59:38,270
- I don't want it!
- Eat it.

408
00:59:40,777 --> 00:59:42,768
- And chew slowly.
- Yes.

409
00:59:42,979 --> 00:59:47,711
We should've come yesterday.
It'll be packed with photographers.

410
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:52,878
- Do you have some coffee?
- Not much, and Marcello needs it.

411
00:59:54,391 --> 00:59:56,358
I don't want a banana.

412
00:59:56,861 --> 00:59:59,955
- I don't want it, Emma!
- Eat it. Eat it.

413
01:00:03,201 --> 01:00:05,031
- And chew slowly.
- Yes.

414
01:00:14,047 --> 01:00:17,072
- The Madonna's children?
- Yes!

415
01:00:17,282 --> 01:00:22,242
- Where is the miracle field?
- That way!

416
01:00:41,377 --> 01:00:44,244
It's better if you stay here.
There's too much confusion.

417
01:00:48,418 --> 01:00:51,182
Norman! Norman!

418
01:00:51,388 --> 01:00:53,856
Here. Don't go anywhere.
Norman!

419
01:00:57,993 --> 01:01:00,223
Hi, Norman.
Where are the children?

420
01:01:00,429 --> 01:01:03,421
They're locked up
in police headquarters.

421
01:01:03,632 --> 01:01:06,862
Take me with you. I'll tell you
all about the Communists.

422
01:01:07,069 --> 01:01:09,333
- Is that the miracle tree?
- It's down there.

423
01:01:13,211 --> 01:01:17,544
Damn you! Damn you! Damn you!

424
01:01:27,994 --> 01:01:32,192
You can't keep those two children
in there. It's an abuse!

425
01:01:32,666 --> 01:01:35,691
- They say everyone's upstairs.
- Let's go in. Come on.

426
01:01:45,914 --> 01:01:47,472
- Where?
- This way!

427
01:01:49,017 --> 01:01:51,508
- Where are the children?
- I don't know.

428
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:53,847
- And where is the marshal?
- Who knows?

429
01:01:59,162 --> 01:02:03,826
What about the 500 lira that
that journalist gave you?

430
01:02:04,033 --> 01:02:06,125
Can I go home?

431
01:02:06,334 --> 01:02:10,168
- Brigadier, sir...
- The lady gave you 1000 lira...

432
01:02:10,373 --> 01:02:13,342
I feel a bad pain in my waist.
I'm catching a cold.

433
01:02:13,544 --> 01:02:15,603
You're right.
It feels like winter already.

434
01:02:15,812 --> 01:02:18,644
If you're going to give me some
money, don't tell my husband.

435
01:02:18,849 --> 01:02:21,909
- I won't give you any. Look over there.
- Where? That way?

436
01:02:28,059 --> 01:02:32,155
- Now over here. Like this.
- The grandfather's here too!

437
01:02:32,364 --> 01:02:35,265
What are the children's names?

438
01:02:35,468 --> 01:02:36,434
- Dario.
- What?

439
01:02:36,635 --> 01:02:39,263
- Dario and Maria.
- Dario and Maria. Nice!

440
01:02:39,539 --> 01:02:40,836
Good! Yes, cry!

441
01:02:41,074 --> 01:02:44,908
It's a real miracle.
The Madonna remembers everyone!

442
01:02:45,111 --> 01:02:48,011
- Do I look good like this?
- You're perfect!

443
01:02:49,683 --> 01:02:52,743
- The cigar?
- I'll give it to you. Sing first.

444
01:02:56,824 --> 01:02:59,691
- Then it's not a miracle?
- I don't believe it.

445
01:02:59,895 --> 01:03:04,298
The Lord can do it anywhere, they
often occur for the less fortunate...

446
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:07,263
...but they are very rare events.
- Couldn't this be one?

447
01:03:07,469 --> 01:03:09,733
No, those youngsters
aren't being honest.

448
01:03:09,939 --> 01:03:15,002
Whoever sees the Madonna is changed.
They don't make money on her!

449
01:03:15,212 --> 01:03:21,480
Miracles are born out of silence,
not in this confusion!

450
01:03:21,919 --> 01:03:24,012
So, kids, while you
were going to school,,,

451
01:03:24,221 --> 01:03:26,018
,,, who did you see next to that tree?

452
01:03:26,224 --> 01:03:29,021
- The Madonna,
- And who saw her first?

453
01:03:29,226 --> 01:03:30,193
- I did!
- I did!

454
01:03:30,394 --> 01:03:34,023
- You saw her together, then?
- No, he saw her first!

455
01:03:34,231 --> 01:03:36,790
- Then what happened?
- They're my niece and nephew.

456
01:03:37,002 --> 01:03:40,665
We got on our knees,
The Madonna looked at us and smiled,

457
01:03:40,872 --> 01:03:42,840
Her feet didn 't touch the ground,

458
01:03:43,075 --> 01:03:45,737
Did she tell you
she was the Madonna?

459
01:03:46,412 --> 01:03:48,902
They really don't want to believe it.

460
01:03:49,516 --> 01:03:51,711
Could it really have been
the Madonna?

461
01:03:51,918 --> 01:03:54,148
It doesn't matter if it is or not.

462
01:03:54,889 --> 01:03:58,585
What do you mean, it doesn't matter?
Why do you say that?

463
01:03:58,792 --> 01:04:00,282
Of course it doesn't matter.

464
01:04:00,495 --> 01:04:05,626
Your Italy is an ancient land filled
with natural and supernatural forces.

465
01:04:06,102 --> 01:04:10,003
Therefore,
everyone feels their influence.

466
01:04:10,205 --> 01:04:12,196
He who looks for God
finds him where he wants.

467
01:04:12,409 --> 01:04:16,742
- Did you come for a miracle too?
- No, I'm here with my boyfriend.

468
01:04:17,279 --> 01:04:20,271
He's a journalist. He's here for work.

469
01:04:21,384 --> 01:04:25,912
All this yelling, these people,
frighten me.

470
01:04:26,122 --> 01:04:30,615
You three stay in that spot.
And don't laugh! Bring up the crane.

471
01:04:31,161 --> 01:04:33,925
Higher. Keep going.

472
01:04:34,298 --> 01:04:38,063
Sorry, I made a mistake!
Come down! Come back down.

473
01:04:38,268 --> 01:04:40,634
Let's try the children's scene!

474
01:04:40,838 --> 01:04:45,901
Remember, the children are smaller.
Am I in the shot? Can you see me?

475
01:04:46,211 --> 01:04:48,144
Come on! Quickly!

476
01:04:48,347 --> 01:04:51,009
Quickly! Hurry, please.

477
01:04:51,951 --> 01:04:55,250
- Here's my boyfriend.
- Good. Go to him.

478
01:04:55,455 --> 01:04:57,581
Excuse me for a moment.

479
01:04:58,124 --> 01:04:59,921
Ready? Go!

480
01:05:00,727 --> 01:05:05,630
Speak up! Why aren't you praying?
Everyone has to yell!

481
01:05:06,201 --> 01:05:08,532
Pray more! Pray more!

482
01:05:09,904 --> 01:05:13,533
Now, it's 7:00.
We'll meet in a couple of hours.

483
01:05:13,808 --> 01:05:18,005
Grab a bite to eat. Thank you. See you
this evening. Have a good meal!

484
01:05:18,213 --> 01:05:24,550
Alessi Emilio, Alessi Stefania.
Bertolucci Eugenio.

485
01:05:25,621 --> 01:05:29,818
Bertone Mario, Bertone Letizia,,,,

486
01:05:30,025 --> 01:05:34,655
Holy Madonna,
make this child of mine get well.

487
01:05:34,865 --> 01:05:38,664
Grant me this wish.
I ask you with all my soul.

488
01:05:45,676 --> 01:05:47,370
Marcello...

489
01:05:51,115 --> 01:05:56,849
Don't worry, honey.
The Madonna hears us. She's good.

490
01:06:30,859 --> 01:06:35,558
A large crowd has gathered in this
once deserted and unknown area.

491
01:06:35,998 --> 01:06:38,625
Many are believers, many are curious.

492
01:06:38,835 --> 01:06:43,169
Among the curious there are journalists,
photo reporters and correspondents...

493
01:06:43,373 --> 01:06:45,534
...from papers all over the world.

494
01:06:46,077 --> 01:06:49,045
There is an innumerable number
of cars piled up.

495
01:06:49,247 --> 01:06:51,340
The night is humid but full of stars.

496
01:06:51,549 --> 01:06:53,983
The weather has improved
after all the rain.

497
01:06:54,185 --> 01:06:57,484
We just found out that the two children
are still held by the police.

498
01:06:57,689 --> 01:07:00,657
We await further word from Rome.

499
01:07:00,859 --> 01:07:04,022
We're now interviewing
the two children's uncle.

500
01:07:04,229 --> 01:07:08,688
We want to ask him, when was
the first time they saw the...

501
01:07:09,167 --> 01:07:11,158
The miracle.

502
01:07:11,369 --> 01:07:17,501
My niece and nephew first saw the holy
image of the Madonna on March 15 of...

503
01:07:19,012 --> 01:07:20,070
...the next year.

504
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:22,646
- You mean the current year.
- The current year. And...

505
01:07:23,384 --> 01:07:24,715
The children are coming.

506
01:07:24,919 --> 01:07:26,819
- Permission from Rome has arrived.
- Really?

507
01:07:27,021 --> 01:07:29,818
- Yes, they are coming.
- The children are coming!

508
01:07:32,326 --> 01:07:35,887
Emma, you stay here. Good evening.
I'll be right back.

509
01:07:36,131 --> 01:07:38,394
- Where are you going?
- I'm going up there to see something.

510
01:07:38,599 --> 01:07:42,262
- I'm coming too.
- No, honey, stay here with the lady.

511
01:07:42,472 --> 01:07:43,837
Come on.

512
01:07:47,310 --> 01:07:48,674
Wait here.

513
01:08:03,895 --> 01:08:05,829
Marcello, come down.

514
01:08:06,031 --> 01:08:08,464
But I just came up. Don't worry.

515
01:08:12,971 --> 01:08:14,097
Should I come up?

516
01:08:18,410 --> 01:08:22,642
Amilcare, tell the generator operator
to move down a bit more,

517
01:08:22,848 --> 01:08:26,477
Try the channel hoses and keep them
at minimum capacity,

518
01:08:26,888 --> 01:08:30,482
Try the channel hoses and keep them
at minimum capacity,

519
01:08:33,995 --> 01:08:37,362
Marcello, why did you change so much?

520
01:08:38,631 --> 01:08:40,792
Why don't you love me anymore?

521
01:08:45,573 --> 01:08:48,632
Holy Madonna, if only he married me...

522
01:08:48,843 --> 01:08:52,779
...I'd come here on foot every day
and thank you.

523
01:08:52,981 --> 01:08:55,108
But I'm not asking you that.

524
01:08:55,585 --> 01:08:58,781
I'd just like him to be mine
as he was once.

525
01:08:58,989 --> 01:09:01,890
- Here they are!
- The children!

526
01:09:02,626 --> 01:09:04,355
Here they are!
Go as high as you can.

527
01:09:04,562 --> 01:09:07,759
As soon as they get to the tree,
get a nice dolly shot.

528
01:09:43,202 --> 01:09:46,330
Wait, don't start yet.
I'll give you the signal!

529
01:09:46,707 --> 01:09:48,231
Hi, beautiful, how are you?

530
01:09:48,442 --> 01:09:53,174
Put the 5000 on them and then
on the crowd. It's dark over here.

531
01:10:02,992 --> 01:10:05,290
My wife is there too.

532
01:10:06,730 --> 01:10:09,789
Sometimes she makes me so upset
and other times...

533
01:10:14,639 --> 01:10:16,869
Heal me!

534
01:10:25,818 --> 01:10:28,048
Calm down, keep calm.

535
01:10:29,388 --> 01:10:31,288
One at a time.

536
01:10:37,931 --> 01:10:40,694
- It's raining.
- This is going to get dangerous.

537
01:10:48,875 --> 01:10:53,004
Massimo, the water makes
the lights explode. Shut everything off!

538
01:10:53,647 --> 01:10:56,172
Turn all generators off!

539
01:10:56,383 --> 01:10:59,147
Turn all generators off!

540
01:11:12,467 --> 01:11:16,961
We had to take shelter in the bus
because it started to rain again.

541
01:11:17,573 --> 01:11:21,099
Mario! Mario!

542
01:11:21,311 --> 01:11:23,779
Mario, where are you?

543
01:11:33,491 --> 01:11:35,584
The Madonna is over there.

544
01:11:51,545 --> 01:11:54,446
The children are getting up again.

545
01:11:54,648 --> 01:11:57,173
Now they're running
in the opposite direction.

546
01:11:57,384 --> 01:11:59,443
They cry out that they see
the Madonna.

547
01:11:59,753 --> 01:12:02,346
The crowd is following them,
going wild.

548
01:12:17,306 --> 01:12:21,207
They changed direction once again,
they're headed to another area.

549
01:12:39,165 --> 01:12:40,688
There she is!

550
01:12:54,347 --> 01:12:57,111
Let me through,
this is going to kill them.

551
01:12:57,317 --> 01:12:59,182
They'll catch pneumonia!

552
01:13:03,189 --> 01:13:05,180
The Madonna said that
if you don't build a church here...

553
01:13:05,391 --> 01:13:07,723
...she won't come anymore.
- Quiet!

554
01:13:07,928 --> 01:13:10,418
The Madonna said
that if you don't build a church here...

555
01:13:10,630 --> 01:13:15,329
...she won't come anymore.
Good night. Go home! Get some sleep!

556
01:14:27,148 --> 01:14:29,742
Let me go! Let me go!

557
01:14:29,986 --> 01:14:33,512
- Paparazzo, give me a break.
- But it's a nice shot!

558
01:14:33,722 --> 01:14:37,920
Let me go! How can you be this way?
It's not possible to be like you!

559
01:14:38,127 --> 01:14:43,291
Hyenas! You're worse than hyenas!
You don't respect anyone!

560
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:47,334
You make me sick! Cowards!

561
01:14:56,814 --> 01:15:00,215
Why are you crying now?!
Where did you leave her?

562
01:15:00,420 --> 01:15:02,751
I don't remember!
I don't remember!

563
01:15:10,896 --> 01:15:12,556
He's dead.

564
01:15:17,037 --> 01:15:19,437
He's dead!

565
01:15:20,007 --> 01:15:22,270
He's dead.

566
01:15:22,475 --> 01:15:27,139
Out of the depths I cry to thee, O Lord.
Lord, hear my voice.

567
01:15:27,347 --> 01:15:30,783
Let thy ears be attentive
to the voice of my supplications.

568
01:15:30,985 --> 01:15:33,475
If thou, O Lord,
shouldst mark iniquities...

569
01:15:38,192 --> 01:15:41,991
...to thou, O Lord, we present
the humble soul of thy son, Aloisio...

570
01:15:42,197 --> 01:15:44,563
...who will live with thou
forever and ever.

571
01:15:48,871 --> 01:15:53,807
Grant him eternal rest, O Lord,
and may perpetual light shine on him.

572
01:16:01,985 --> 01:16:02,119
Good evening, I'm Steiner's wife.
We were waiting for you.

573
01:16:02,119 --> 01:16:06,579
Good evening, I'm Steiner's wife.
We were waiting for you.

574
01:16:21,940 --> 01:16:24,067
Good evening, Marcello.
How are you?

575
01:16:24,275 --> 01:16:26,800
Good. What a lovely home.

576
01:16:27,013 --> 01:16:30,676
Is this Emma?
I've been wanting to meet you.

577
01:16:31,785 --> 01:16:34,345
- Thanks for coming.
- Pardon me.

578
01:16:34,554 --> 01:16:35,782
Come here.

579
01:16:36,423 --> 01:16:39,085
- Hi, Anna, how are you?
- Did you finish your book?

580
01:16:39,494 --> 01:16:41,655
This is Margherita.
You know her paintings.

581
01:16:41,862 --> 01:16:43,090
- Of course.
- Sure!

582
01:16:43,297 --> 01:16:45,993
- You didn't even come to my exhibition.
- What a beautiful hand.

583
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:47,792
She's a big fan of yours...

584
01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:51,369
...but it's not true, because she
doesn't speak a word of Italian.

585
01:16:51,573 --> 01:16:53,938
She only said that
you're very decorative.

586
01:16:54,144 --> 01:16:55,577
She's right.

587
01:16:57,680 --> 01:17:00,672
It might sound strange,
but I think I know you well.

588
01:17:01,118 --> 01:17:05,451
The day you understand that you love
Marcello more than he does...

589
01:17:07,157 --> 01:17:09,182
...you'll be happy.

590
01:17:13,831 --> 01:17:17,961
I always said it. The only real woman
is the Oriental one.

591
01:17:18,170 --> 01:17:22,038
After all, where was Eve?
In the Garden of Eden.

592
01:17:22,273 --> 01:17:25,106
And where was the Garden of Eden?
In the Orient!

593
01:17:25,310 --> 01:17:28,905
- Over there, love is really...
- Why did you marry me, then?

594
01:17:29,115 --> 01:17:31,379
I know, I made a big mistake.

595
01:17:31,684 --> 01:17:35,744
Mysterious, motherly,
both lover and daughter.

596
01:17:35,955 --> 01:17:40,915
The Oriental woman huddles
at your feet like a little tiger in love.

597
01:17:41,196 --> 01:17:44,062
This guy's been talking
about the Orient for 15 years.

598
01:17:44,265 --> 01:17:45,630
Why doesn't he stay there?

599
01:17:46,034 --> 01:17:48,468
- Will you introduce Emma to me?
- Of course.

600
01:17:48,670 --> 01:17:51,400
What a lovely face!
Can I say something?

601
01:17:51,607 --> 01:17:53,267
Don't lose hold of this man.

602
01:17:53,474 --> 01:17:57,706
I'm saying this in his best interest,
not yours, otherwise...

603
01:17:57,912 --> 01:18:01,143
The Oriental submits both
her spirit and her flesh...

604
01:18:01,350 --> 01:18:02,714
...entirely!

605
01:18:02,917 --> 01:18:07,445
May I introduce my friend Marcello
and his girlfriend Emma?

606
01:18:07,657 --> 01:18:08,817
Good evening, everyone.

607
01:18:09,025 --> 01:18:11,084
I agree with your concept on women.

608
01:18:11,361 --> 01:18:14,158
We have much to learn
from these Oriental women.

609
01:18:14,364 --> 01:18:16,992
Because they've remained
close to nature...

610
01:18:17,234 --> 01:18:20,829
...the nature they conquered
after many centuries of civilization.

611
01:18:21,039 --> 01:18:24,098
- What use is civilization to you?
- Say what?

612
01:18:24,309 --> 01:18:27,972
I'll tell you. You don't know
how to make love anymore!

613
01:18:28,179 --> 01:18:30,272
Speak for yourself, Leonida.

614
01:18:30,849 --> 01:18:32,316
- Would you like a drink?
- Yes, thanks.

615
01:18:32,517 --> 01:18:34,347
I envy you very much.

616
01:18:34,552 --> 01:18:37,680
You know, I've read all your stories
from around the world.

617
01:18:37,890 --> 01:18:40,984
I'd like to travel myself.
You get the chance...

618
01:18:41,228 --> 01:18:43,718
...to meet exceptional people,
women of all races.

619
01:18:43,930 --> 01:18:46,455
I'd like to have children of all colors:
Red, yellow...

620
01:18:46,666 --> 01:18:49,726
Imagine the satisfaction.
Like a bouquet of country flowers.

621
01:18:49,969 --> 01:18:51,596
Can't you say anything else?

622
01:18:51,805 --> 01:18:54,102
You must have an incredible
gallery of memories.

623
01:18:54,308 --> 01:18:55,109
Memories? You think someone my age
can be happy with memories?

624
01:18:55,109 --> 01:18:57,543
Memories? You think someone my age
can be happy with memories?

625
01:18:57,746 --> 01:18:59,543
Most of all, I have projects.

626
01:18:59,748 --> 01:19:02,944
What a splendid creature.
You're our friend's girlfriend?

627
01:19:03,217 --> 01:19:05,515
- Yes.
- You must be from the South.

628
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:07,620
What an extraordinary guy.

629
01:19:07,822 --> 01:19:13,691
He's written dozens of important books
and has maintained a childish candor.

630
01:19:13,895 --> 01:19:17,194
I wonder where he finds so much
optimism, so much faith.

631
01:19:18,134 --> 01:19:21,433
I'm happy that he comes and
I always watch him with awe.

632
01:19:21,639 --> 01:19:24,038
At times, I wonder if I envy him.

633
01:19:24,541 --> 01:19:28,033
Listen, I see that you have
a wonderful Morandi.

634
01:19:28,246 --> 01:19:31,238
Oh, yes, he's my favorite painter.

635
01:19:31,449 --> 01:19:34,042
The objects are flooded
with a wistful light...

636
01:19:34,252 --> 01:19:38,188
...and yet painted with such
a detachment, precision, rigor...

637
01:19:39,223 --> 01:19:42,420
...that makes them almost tangible.
You can say that it's an art...

638
01:19:42,627 --> 01:19:44,787
...where nothing is coincidental.

639
01:19:44,996 --> 01:19:47,362
Steiner said that you have two loves...

640
01:19:48,233 --> 01:19:50,861
...and you don't know
which one to choose.

641
01:19:51,071 --> 01:19:55,769
Journalism and literature.
Watch out for prisons.

642
01:19:55,975 --> 01:19:59,433
Stay free, available, like me.

643
01:19:59,646 --> 01:20:03,013
Never get married. Never choose.

644
01:20:03,551 --> 01:20:06,111
Even in love, it's better to be chosen.

645
01:20:10,559 --> 01:20:13,789
I read your poetry a few years ago,
when I thought about writing poetry.

646
01:20:13,995 --> 01:20:16,190
I like it. It's strong, sharp.

647
01:20:16,398 --> 01:20:20,892
- It doesn't seem like a woman's writing.
- What do you know about women?

648
01:20:21,104 --> 01:20:25,039
This is the art I prefer.
The one I think we'll need tomorrow.

649
01:20:25,241 --> 01:20:27,300
A clear, precise art...

650
01:20:27,510 --> 01:20:31,674
...without rhetoric, that doesn't lie,
that isn't flattering.

651
01:20:31,882 --> 01:20:36,545
Now I have a job that I don't like,
but I often think about tomorrow.

652
01:20:36,754 --> 01:20:41,214
We must all think about tomorrow,
but without forgetting to live today.

653
01:20:41,625 --> 01:20:44,991
I think if one lives intensely...

654
01:20:45,195 --> 01:20:49,564
...in fullness of spirit,
every instant will count as a year...

655
01:20:49,768 --> 01:20:53,760
...and every year one
will be five years younger!

656
01:20:57,009 --> 01:21:03,039
- Iris, you're an oracle tonight.
- An alcoholic oracle!

657
01:21:04,251 --> 01:21:07,220
Oh, friends, you think too much
about the future.

658
01:21:07,421 --> 01:21:11,824
But you seem so different.
What do you do with your days?

659
01:21:12,026 --> 01:21:15,791
I mean, what do you like to do most?

660
01:21:16,865 --> 01:21:19,356
Well, I don't know. And you?

661
01:21:19,568 --> 01:21:23,129
I know it exactly.
I like the three big escapes:

662
01:21:23,338 --> 01:21:28,240
- Drinking, smoking and going to bed.
- And this is your wisdom.

663
01:21:28,444 --> 01:21:31,470
You read my poems,
but you never understood me.

664
01:21:31,714 --> 01:21:36,946
You are the true primitive,
as primitive as a Gothic spire.

665
01:21:37,153 --> 01:21:42,455
You're so tall that you can't hear
any more voices up there.

666
01:21:42,660 --> 01:21:46,925
If you could see my real height,
you'll see I'm not much taller than this:

667
01:21:57,041 --> 01:21:59,100
- As primitive as a Gothic spire,

668
01:21:59,312 --> 01:22:05,216
You're so tall that you can 't hear
any more voices up there,

669
01:22:05,418 --> 01:22:10,151
If you could see my real height,
you'll see I'm not much taller than this:

670
01:22:14,794 --> 01:22:18,457
Oh, this is an old recording.
I'm sorry, I'll shut it off.

671
01:22:18,665 --> 01:22:21,896
What is it? Why can't we hear it?

672
01:22:22,103 --> 01:22:24,935
I don't want to bore you.
They're just sounds.

673
01:22:25,205 --> 01:22:27,935
They're nature sounds he's recorded.

674
01:22:28,143 --> 01:22:30,509
- Tell him to play them, please.
- No, it's not worth it.

675
01:22:30,713 --> 01:22:31,839
Come on.

676
01:22:32,047 --> 01:22:34,537
If they don't interest you,
why did you record them?

677
01:22:34,750 --> 01:22:38,777
Because I thought they were beautiful.
Do you really want to hear them?

678
01:22:38,989 --> 01:22:41,822
I already know them,
they're extremely stimulating.

679
01:22:42,025 --> 01:22:43,322
As you wish.

680
01:23:09,554 --> 01:23:11,215
Birds.

681
01:23:14,093 --> 01:23:16,026
That's exactly how they sound.

682
01:23:23,304 --> 01:23:24,532
This is a forest.

683
01:23:35,684 --> 01:23:37,879
What are you guys doing here?

684
01:23:38,787 --> 01:23:42,086
- Why did you get out of bed?
- Excuse me a moment.

685
01:23:42,292 --> 01:23:45,454
You'll get a cold with those bare feet!

686
01:23:45,695 --> 01:23:48,220
He heard your storm and he woke up.

687
01:23:51,735 --> 01:23:55,534
- You just wanted one more kiss!
- Daddy hardhead.

688
01:23:55,737 --> 01:23:59,833
Daddy hardhead?
All right, everyone knows now!

689
01:24:00,042 --> 01:24:03,534
- Daddy's hardheaded.
- What lovely children!

690
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:08,577
- Such intelligent eyes he has.
- Yes, it's true.

691
01:24:08,785 --> 01:24:10,878
When one says something
that strikes him...

692
01:24:11,089 --> 01:24:16,492
...first he thinks about it with a serious
little face and then he laughs cheerfully.

693
01:24:17,862 --> 01:24:21,559
If you give him a flower,
first he looks at every part...

694
01:24:21,767 --> 01:24:24,827
...then he laughs because
he understands that it's beautiful.

695
01:24:25,037 --> 01:24:28,063
The same way you smile when
you listen to some good music.

696
01:24:29,209 --> 01:24:31,905
Well, now, be good
and go back to sleep.

697
01:24:32,113 --> 01:24:34,707
Then, I promise,
I'll come say good night.

698
01:24:34,915 --> 01:24:37,382
- Now, say good night to everyone.
- Good night.

699
01:24:38,352 --> 01:24:44,313
The girl is completely different.
She loves combinations of words.

700
01:24:44,526 --> 01:24:46,459
A new phrase enchants her.

701
01:24:47,228 --> 01:24:50,857
At times she invents beautiful ones
herself. I noted some of them.

702
01:24:51,166 --> 01:24:55,864
For example:
"Who is the mother of the sun?"

703
01:24:57,440 --> 01:25:01,467
It's really beautiful.
It's like a poet's phrase.

704
01:25:02,211 --> 01:25:06,977
- And do they sleep with you?
- They'd like to, but we don't allow it.

705
01:25:07,517 --> 01:25:11,146
At times, though, the little one
sneaks into our room...

706
01:25:11,355 --> 01:25:14,813
...and jumps in bed
between his mother and I.

707
01:25:15,025 --> 01:25:17,925
He takes her finger
and squeezes it really hard.

708
01:25:18,929 --> 01:25:25,129
You can't imagine how sweet it is
to fall asleep with a child next to you.

709
01:25:36,548 --> 01:25:39,449
Have you known Steiner
for a long time?

710
01:25:39,653 --> 01:25:44,818
Yes, but we've only seen each other
three or four times. But...

711
01:26:05,914 --> 01:26:09,816
Marcello, one day you too
will have a house like this.

712
01:26:19,296 --> 01:26:24,165
We get on well together, don't we?
We're made for each other.

713
01:26:50,164 --> 01:26:54,567
- Let me come here more often.
- I told you, you can come anytime.

714
01:26:55,503 --> 01:26:57,333
What is it, Marcello?

715
01:26:58,173 --> 01:27:02,610
I should change environment.
I should change many things.

716
01:27:04,748 --> 01:27:06,510
Your house is a real refuge.

717
01:27:06,715 --> 01:27:10,674
Your children, your wife, your books,
your extraordinary friends...

718
01:27:10,886 --> 01:27:14,287
Me, I'm wasting time.
I won't manage anything anymore.

719
01:27:14,490 --> 01:27:18,789
Once I had ambitions,
but maybe I'm losing everything.

720
01:27:19,128 --> 01:27:20,857
I forgot everything.

721
01:27:21,498 --> 01:27:25,798
Don't think that safety is being locked
up in one's home. Don't do what I did.

722
01:27:26,837 --> 01:27:32,537
I'm too serious to be an amateur, but
not enough to be a professional. There.

723
01:27:34,011 --> 01:27:37,468
A more miserable life
is better, believe me...

724
01:27:37,682 --> 01:27:42,244
...than an existence protected
by an organized society...

725
01:27:42,453 --> 01:27:45,684
...where everything is calculated,
everything is perfect.

726
01:27:48,060 --> 01:27:52,963
Marcello, I can only be your friend,
therefore I can't give you any advice.

727
01:27:53,166 --> 01:27:54,599
But if you want my help...

728
01:27:54,802 --> 01:27:58,237
...I can have you meet an editor
who can give you a decent job...

729
01:27:58,438 --> 01:28:02,636
...and give you the chance to focus
on what interests you more.

730
01:28:03,144 --> 01:28:06,909
It's always better than writing
for those half-fascist papers, no?

731
01:28:07,114 --> 01:28:10,481
Do you want to think about it
and discuss it later?

732
01:28:10,851 --> 01:28:11,909
Yes.

733
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:19,727
Come.

734
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:36,472
Sometimes at night this darkness,
this silence, weighs on me.

735
01:29:38,247 --> 01:29:40,442
Peace frightens me.

736
01:29:40,750 --> 01:29:44,186
I'm afraid of peace more than
anything else. To me it seems...

737
01:29:44,389 --> 01:29:49,257
...that it's only an outer shell
and that hell is hiding behind it.

738
01:29:49,460 --> 01:29:52,554
I think of what my children
will see tomorrow.

739
01:29:53,198 --> 01:29:55,496
"The world will be wonderful," they say.

740
01:29:55,700 --> 01:29:58,668
From what point of view?
When a phone call...

741
01:29:58,870 --> 01:30:01,566
...can announce the end of the world.

742
01:30:02,307 --> 01:30:05,834
One should live outside of passions,
beyond emotions...

743
01:30:06,045 --> 01:30:09,480
...in that harmony you find
in completed artworks...

744
01:30:09,681 --> 01:30:12,445
...in that enchanted order.

745
01:30:13,987 --> 01:30:17,115
We should learn to love each other
so much...

746
01:30:17,325 --> 01:30:21,124
...to live outside of time, detached...

747
01:30:24,165 --> 01:30:26,360
Detached.

748
01:30:29,035 --> 01:30:29,057
I

749
01:30:34,741 --> 01:30:38,107
I can't spend my life calling you
on the phone!

750
01:30:38,978 --> 01:30:42,175
I want to work in peace!
I don't know!

751
01:30:42,382 --> 01:30:45,215
Miss, could you please
shut off that music?

752
01:30:47,721 --> 01:30:50,349
No, I won't tell you where I am.
I don't know when I'll be back!

753
01:30:50,558 --> 01:30:54,153
Go to hell!
Wretched madwoman.

754
01:31:14,485 --> 01:31:17,181
Quit it with that little voice,
will you?

755
01:31:18,656 --> 01:31:21,955
- Paola, this is broken.
- Go get another one, then.

756
01:31:22,159 --> 01:31:26,391
- Are you having anything to eat?
- No. Yes... I don't know.

757
01:31:27,066 --> 01:31:28,896
The food is good, you know.

758
01:31:34,940 --> 01:31:39,433
- Is it difficult to type?
- Do you want to be a typist?

759
01:31:39,777 --> 01:31:41,608
I'd like to.

760
01:31:41,981 --> 01:31:45,747
- You're a pretty girl, you know?
- Pretty, you're exaggerating!

761
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:49,317
Come on, you know very well
that you're pretty.

762
01:31:49,522 --> 01:31:52,218
- Okay.
- Paola, this one's broken too.

763
01:31:52,493 --> 01:31:55,656
You're not from Rome.
Where are you from?

764
01:31:56,264 --> 01:31:59,926
- I'm from Umbria, near Perugia.
- Why did you come here?

765
01:32:00,135 --> 01:32:02,603
My father works in Anzio,
that's why I came here.

766
01:32:02,804 --> 01:32:06,399
After Christmas, though, I'm either
going to Ostia or to Rome.

767
01:32:07,943 --> 01:32:10,740
- Who is he? Your brother?
- No, he's my helper.

768
01:32:10,947 --> 01:32:13,211
Wow, they treat you well here.

769
01:32:13,416 --> 01:32:17,113
Well, yes, they treat me well,
but I don't like it much.

770
01:32:17,321 --> 01:32:19,311
I can't wait to go home.

771
01:32:19,589 --> 01:32:22,057
Sunday I saw a car
with Perugia license plates...

772
01:32:22,259 --> 01:32:25,922
...and I felt so homesick
that I could've cried.

773
01:32:28,732 --> 01:32:29,994
Let's see your profile.

774
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:31,799
- Why?
- Let's see it.

775
01:32:32,003 --> 01:32:34,403
- But why?
- Come on, one second.

776
01:32:35,339 --> 01:32:37,603
You look like one of those little angels...

777
01:32:37,809 --> 01:32:39,708
...from the paintings
of an Umbrian church.

778
01:32:39,911 --> 01:32:42,277
- They've already told you, huh?
- No.

779
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:43,879
Why are you laughing?

780
01:32:44,082 --> 01:32:45,344
No reason.

781
01:32:46,985 --> 01:32:50,886
- Do you have a boyfriend?
- Yeah, right, a boyfriend.

782
01:32:58,299 --> 01:32:59,629
You're not writing anymore?

783
01:33:02,102 --> 01:33:05,299
- Then can I turn the music back on?
- Yes, sure.

784
01:33:06,875 --> 01:33:09,342
You want to throw out
this piece of paper too?

785
01:33:50,455 --> 01:33:52,013
What do you want?

786
01:33:57,530 --> 01:34:00,692
- Marcello, your father is here.
- My father?

787
01:34:00,899 --> 01:34:04,699
- Over there. He said he was your father.
- Come on, don't joke around.

788
01:34:04,903 --> 01:34:10,033
He's over there, eating at that table.
He's been looking for you for two hours.

789
01:34:10,277 --> 01:34:12,302
Didn't he say he was his father?

790
01:34:15,416 --> 01:34:18,317
Marcello, it's true,
he's at that table over there.

791
01:34:18,519 --> 01:34:21,043
- Where?
- Next to the black man.

792
01:34:34,405 --> 01:34:37,340
Dad. Dad!

793
01:34:38,910 --> 01:34:42,470
Marcello! Finally.

794
01:34:42,681 --> 01:34:45,013
I arrived in Rome this morning.

795
01:34:45,216 --> 01:34:48,117
I looked for you everywhere:
At home, at work.

796
01:34:48,421 --> 01:34:52,151
I was about to leave when a friend
of yours told me to wait for you here.

797
01:34:52,356 --> 01:34:53,584
Yes, Paparazzo.

798
01:34:53,791 --> 01:34:58,592
With my line of work, I run around
all day, Dad. I only go home to sleep.

799
01:34:58,830 --> 01:35:00,126
How come you're in Rome?

800
01:35:00,331 --> 01:35:03,892
To solicit that damn case
at the Ministry.

801
01:35:04,103 --> 01:35:07,436
Everything gets shelved here.
Anyway, you look well.

802
01:35:07,740 --> 01:35:09,173
- You look well too.
- I'm okay.

803
01:35:09,374 --> 01:35:11,103
And how's Mother?

804
01:35:11,310 --> 01:35:13,301
She gave me a letter for you.

805
01:35:13,512 --> 01:35:17,039
She's well, but always worrying,
you know. She's always been that way.

806
01:35:17,250 --> 01:35:20,980
And with age, these things get worse.
Here it is.

807
01:35:22,223 --> 01:35:23,451
Poor Mother.

808
01:35:23,658 --> 01:35:27,150
But really, you could
write more often, son...

809
01:35:27,363 --> 01:35:29,354
...and even come once in a while.

810
01:35:29,564 --> 01:35:32,089
- You haven't been home in a long time.
- I know, but here...

811
01:35:32,301 --> 01:35:34,326
- Hi, Marcello.
- Hi.

812
01:35:35,038 --> 01:35:36,835
- She said hello.
- Yes.

813
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:38,871
- Is she an actress?
- What?

814
01:35:39,076 --> 01:35:43,034
She wishes. She's a two-bit extra.
An actress!

815
01:35:44,381 --> 01:35:46,679
Do you want a drink, Dad?
You want a gin-fizz?

816
01:35:46,883 --> 01:35:50,409
What? A "gin-fritz"?
No, my beer is just fine.

817
01:35:52,690 --> 01:35:56,888
Hell of a hustle here at night!
Is it like this every night?

818
01:35:57,094 --> 01:36:02,463
- Yes.
- In our town, it's pretty sad at this hour.

819
01:36:02,833 --> 01:36:07,497
- Are you well here? Have you adjusted?
- Well, yes. It's been a while now.

820
01:36:07,939 --> 01:36:10,099
How's work going? Is it fruitful?

821
01:36:10,408 --> 01:36:14,674
If you're a good journalist, it can be
pretty fruitful. I've been lucky.

822
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:18,976
- Now I know everyone, I can get around.
- Really?

823
01:36:19,186 --> 01:36:21,585
I have a car, that one over there,
an apartment...

824
01:36:21,788 --> 01:36:22,777
By the way...

825
01:36:22,990 --> 01:36:25,584
...every time I called, some woman
answered the phone.

826
01:36:25,793 --> 01:36:26,987
- Who's she?
- What?

827
01:36:27,194 --> 01:36:28,923
I won't say anything,
you're a man now...

828
01:36:29,130 --> 01:36:33,031
...just don't do anything foolish.
Having fun is fine, we're not saints...

829
01:36:33,234 --> 01:36:36,499
...but marriage is something serious.
When someone lives with you...

830
01:36:36,704 --> 01:36:41,538
No, no, Dad, I understand.
You spoke with the cleaning lady.

831
01:36:43,011 --> 01:36:45,809
- Good evening. You finally found him.
- Yes, thanks.

832
01:36:46,116 --> 01:36:49,108
- You've already met my father, right?
- Sure. We're friends.

833
01:36:49,319 --> 01:36:51,786
Yes, he's the one who told me
to wait for you here.

834
01:36:51,988 --> 01:36:54,718
Are you a photographer?
A photo reporter!

835
01:36:55,025 --> 01:36:59,086
Interesting work.
Artistic work, in some ways.

836
01:36:59,297 --> 01:37:00,820
Do you work with my son?

837
01:37:01,032 --> 01:37:03,626
- Unfortunately, yes, I got gypped.
- That's a good one!

838
01:37:03,835 --> 01:37:06,065
Do you have any idea
where the prince is?

839
01:37:06,270 --> 01:37:08,761
I was about to bust him,
but he got away.

840
01:37:09,041 --> 01:37:12,339
- I'm going to take a look around. Bye.
- Maybe you guys are busy.

841
01:37:12,543 --> 01:37:16,604
- No, we're not, Dad.
- You can tell me if you have to go.

842
01:37:16,915 --> 01:37:19,577
- There's work here too.
- Really?

843
01:37:20,220 --> 01:37:24,212
You know, important people come here,
they make news, we take pictures...

844
01:37:24,423 --> 01:37:26,618
- My paper is up there.
- I see.

845
01:37:27,025 --> 01:37:30,085
Well, you just sit here, then?

846
01:37:31,598 --> 01:37:33,031
Shall we go to the cinema?

847
01:37:33,233 --> 01:37:37,1000
No, I always go to the cinema.
At home, there's nothing else to do.

848
01:37:38,205 --> 01:37:43,141
It doesn't matter. No, I'll leave you
alone now. You guys are young...

849
01:37:43,345 --> 01:37:45,836
No, Dad, we don't have a thing to do.

850
01:37:46,181 --> 01:37:51,948
Why, what can we do? I mean, just for
a couple of hours before going to bed.

851
01:37:52,220 --> 01:37:54,381
There are only nightclubs at this hour.

852
01:37:54,590 --> 01:37:57,650
By the way, a friend of mine
who was here told me...

853
01:37:57,861 --> 01:38:01,694
...about a place that's not too bad.
Some sort of cabaret...

854
01:38:02,032 --> 01:38:04,364
The Chit Chat... The Ca Ca...

855
01:38:04,568 --> 01:38:06,798
The Cha Cha!
That's an old club.

856
01:38:07,004 --> 01:38:09,700
- The Cha Cha, right!
- Do you want to go there?

857
01:38:09,907 --> 01:38:15,401
I mean, just to take a look.
Since I'm not here that often.

858
01:38:15,613 --> 01:38:19,242
- Paparazzo!
- Good. Invite your friend too.

859
01:38:19,450 --> 01:38:24,409
- No, no, no. I'm paying here.
- No, Dad, come on... Okay.

860
01:38:24,622 --> 01:38:27,113
- Antonio, come here.
- Waiter!

861
01:38:28,027 --> 01:38:29,654
Paparazzo!

862
01:38:31,029 --> 01:38:32,929
- Come on, let's go with my father!
- Where?

863
01:38:33,132 --> 01:38:36,226
- Let's go!
- Hey, what about the prince?

864
01:38:36,435 --> 01:38:40,962
Oh, I see. You pay everything
together here. That's okay.

865
01:38:41,273 --> 01:38:44,709
Paparazzo, hurry, get in the car.
This way, Dad.

866
01:38:44,912 --> 01:38:46,743
- Let's go!
- Where are we going?

867
01:38:46,948 --> 01:38:50,906
- We're going to the Cha Cha Cha.
- Marcello, but...

868
01:38:51,118 --> 01:38:53,348
- Take yours, then.
- I'll do the scoop myself.

869
01:38:53,554 --> 01:38:56,022
Tell the editor-in-chief
I'll call him at home.

870
01:38:56,225 --> 01:39:01,184
- Get busy, boys! Bye, Mariella.
- Paparazzo, see you at the morgue!

871
01:39:22,719 --> 01:39:25,381
- Is this table okay, gentlemen?
- Nothing has changed.

872
01:39:25,590 --> 01:39:28,354
It's just like I remember it.
Unbelievable.

873
01:39:28,793 --> 01:39:33,559
- Were you here in 1922?
- No, I was in Turin.

874
01:39:33,765 --> 01:39:36,734
- I've been here for a couple of years.
- Oh, good.

875
01:39:46,278 --> 01:39:48,143
Would you like something
to drink, Dad?

876
01:39:48,348 --> 01:39:49,747
Of course I want to drink!

877
01:39:49,950 --> 01:39:51,814
- Do you want a whiskey?
- Yes.

878
01:39:52,019 --> 01:39:54,510
Fine. Bring us three glasses
of whiskey, please.

879
01:39:54,722 --> 01:39:57,589
- Sure. Which brand?
- Black & White.

880
01:39:58,026 --> 01:40:01,392
Why don't we do a nice report for
the paper in here? It's like a cemetery.

881
01:40:01,595 --> 01:40:05,122
She's beautiful.
She's got those long legs.

882
01:40:05,333 --> 01:40:08,131
- What?
- He said she has long legs.

883
01:40:08,336 --> 01:40:10,201
- Have you been to Paris?
- No.

884
01:40:10,407 --> 01:40:12,203
I went there a couple of times.

885
01:40:12,408 --> 01:40:16,538
Once, in a cabaret like this one,
there was a beautiful girl...

886
01:40:16,746 --> 01:40:19,112
...she had long legs like that one.

887
01:40:19,314 --> 01:40:24,842
She stripped, and once naked,
we discovered she was a guy!

888
01:40:26,357 --> 01:40:29,121
- Do you have a father?
- Yes, I do.

889
01:40:29,326 --> 01:40:32,624
He must be young, you're just a kid.
What does he do?

890
01:40:32,830 --> 01:40:37,893
Nothing, he's a drifter. He does nothing
all day. He just gives my mother grief.

891
01:40:38,104 --> 01:40:42,437
He sings, he whistles, he'd like to go
to the cinema but has no money.

892
01:40:42,641 --> 01:40:44,973
- No, it's not true, Dad.
- Well, it could be.

893
01:41:18,247 --> 01:41:20,579
Hey, Paparazzo. Isn't that Fanny?

894
01:41:31,928 --> 01:41:35,385
- Lilly, look who's here.
- He's something!

895
01:41:43,707 --> 01:41:46,699
I'm still waiting for the picture
in your paper. You jerk.

896
01:41:46,911 --> 01:41:48,811
And you're just beautiful!

897
01:41:49,013 --> 01:41:51,004
- What's her name?
- Fanny.

898
01:41:51,217 --> 01:41:53,776
- You know her well?
- He sure does!

899
01:41:53,986 --> 01:41:56,887
- She's French.
- Pleasant girl.

900
01:41:57,223 --> 01:41:58,918
So she's French.

901
01:42:09,236 --> 01:42:10,828
Liar.

902
01:42:11,038 --> 01:42:13,870
Joker. Swindler.

903
01:42:14,074 --> 01:42:16,269
How can you go out
with friends like him?

904
01:42:16,477 --> 01:42:18,536
- He's my father.
- Yeah, sure!

905
01:42:18,746 --> 01:42:21,237
- She doesn't believe it, Dad.
- No?

906
01:42:22,084 --> 01:42:24,244
- Really?
- Yes.

907
01:42:24,452 --> 01:42:27,910
- Good evening, miss.
- Good evening, sir.

908
01:42:30,926 --> 01:42:34,520
- Good job.
- It's because I promised her a photo...

909
01:42:34,729 --> 01:42:38,028
...but she's a nice girl.
- I don't doubt it.

910
01:42:38,234 --> 01:42:40,464
- Shall we invite her to the table?
- Why not?

911
01:42:40,670 --> 01:42:46,039
Let's invite her. In that case, boys,
let's order a bottle of champagne.

912
01:42:46,242 --> 01:42:49,769
- What? An orange juice will be fine.
- No, champagne is fine.

913
01:42:49,981 --> 01:42:52,676
- Champagne is okay, Dad.
- Let's order the best!

914
01:42:52,884 --> 01:42:55,944
I know what I'm talking about.
I am a connoisseur.

915
01:42:56,354 --> 01:42:58,879
I sold champagne to half of Italy!

916
01:42:59,225 --> 01:43:01,693
Meanwhile, have a drop of whiskey.

917
01:43:24,251 --> 01:43:26,116
Cheers to you.

918
01:43:28,723 --> 01:43:30,918
- Cheers to you, Dad.
- Thanks.

919
01:43:36,330 --> 01:43:38,764
- Good!
- Yes, it's good.

920
01:43:46,174 --> 01:43:48,301
- Did you order the champagne?
- Of course.

921
01:43:48,511 --> 01:43:52,106
Here. It comes with the waitress!
What more do you want?

922
01:43:52,449 --> 01:43:54,814
- Fanny. No, don't bother.
- My pleasure.

923
01:43:55,019 --> 01:43:57,817
I'm not saying hello to you.
You either.

924
01:43:58,022 --> 01:44:01,958
- See how your son works? Nice job!
- I see, I see.

925
01:44:02,328 --> 01:44:05,728
Send him back to his hometown!

926
01:44:05,931 --> 01:44:08,525
- Tell me, you're not his father, are you?
- Sure, I am!

927
01:44:08,734 --> 01:44:10,292
It's not possible.
You're too young!

928
01:44:10,503 --> 01:44:13,938
Oh, please, miss,
let's not talk about age.

929
01:44:14,139 --> 01:44:19,304
"Don't awaken desperate sorrow,
because my heart would suffer!"

930
01:44:19,646 --> 01:44:22,672
I'll tell you, it's boredom that ages us.

931
01:44:22,883 --> 01:44:25,476
I traveled a lot for business
as a young man.

932
01:44:25,686 --> 01:44:27,881
When I was on the road,
I felt like a lion.

933
01:44:28,088 --> 01:44:33,423
Even now, when I travel, I can keep up
with any of these young men...

934
01:44:33,627 --> 01:44:37,393
...but at home, it's as though I were 80.

935
01:44:37,598 --> 01:44:41,864
What are you doing? You can use
your abilities to open a bottle of Coke.

936
01:44:42,070 --> 01:44:44,560
But I'll take care of the champagne.

937
01:44:47,977 --> 01:44:49,410
Quiet. Look.

938
01:44:55,484 --> 01:44:59,750
It's so beautiful.
It always makes me cry.

939
01:45:00,524 --> 01:45:03,458
Yes, it makes me cry.

940
01:45:33,528 --> 01:45:36,223
Miss, your champagne.

941
01:45:38,433 --> 01:45:44,166
To your beautiful legs,
which I greatly admire. Cheers.

942
01:46:40,401 --> 01:46:42,426
Good, very good.

943
01:46:42,637 --> 01:46:47,096
But we have to drink another drop.
Yes, we do.

944
01:46:48,809 --> 01:46:52,336
First I toasted to your beautiful legs...

945
01:46:52,746 --> 01:46:55,043
...now we must toast...

946
01:47:00,154 --> 01:47:03,055
I wasn't going to say
anything scandalous.

947
01:47:03,458 --> 01:47:05,891
Your father is much funnier
than you are.

948
01:47:06,093 --> 01:47:08,425
- Much, much funnier!
- Come on.

949
01:47:08,630 --> 01:47:11,758
Oh, please, miss. Don't be silly.

950
01:47:12,235 --> 01:47:17,228
I want to teach you a difficult game.
Let's see if you can do it as well.

951
01:47:17,640 --> 01:47:21,736
Pay attention.
You put a coin on your forehead...

952
01:47:21,945 --> 01:47:24,311
...and you make it fall
without touching your nose.

953
01:47:24,516 --> 01:47:28,384
- But this is easy. A baby could do it.
- Want to try?

954
01:47:28,586 --> 01:47:32,682
Let's take a coin
and put it on your forehead.

955
01:47:32,892 --> 01:47:36,327
There. Let's see.
Let's see you do it.

956
01:47:37,162 --> 01:47:39,528
- Wait, wait.
- I'm waiting.

957
01:47:42,135 --> 01:47:43,966
Wait, perhaps...

958
01:47:47,374 --> 01:47:52,778
You got me!
Now I tell you a joke...

959
01:47:52,980 --> 01:47:55,846
...a nice little story.

960
01:47:57,617 --> 01:48:02,520
Look, it's a story about a woman who
sends her husband to the market...

961
01:48:02,723 --> 01:48:08,422
...to buy three shirts,
six pairs of handkerchiefs and...

962
01:48:08,663 --> 01:48:12,064
...what do you call this for women?

963
01:48:12,434 --> 01:48:14,095
Brassiere.

964
01:48:15,504 --> 01:48:21,807
So along the way, the man drinks
some wine and forgets everything.

965
01:48:22,011 --> 01:48:25,502
- When he gets home, the teacher says...
- The teacher?

966
01:48:25,715 --> 01:48:28,081
- The wife.
- The wife, come on, Paparazzo.

967
01:48:28,284 --> 01:48:30,912
"Well, did you take care
of my business?"

968
01:48:31,120 --> 01:48:34,317
"I got everything," he answers and takes
out his handkerchief and she says:

969
01:48:34,525 --> 01:48:37,254
"Where are the handkerchiefs?"
"Here they are!"

970
01:48:37,462 --> 01:48:41,592
"One, two, three, four, five, six."

971
01:48:41,800 --> 01:48:47,169
"Where are the shirts?" she asks.
"Here they are, dear. One, two."

972
01:48:47,372 --> 01:48:50,034
Then she says,
"And where is the brassiere?"

973
01:48:50,243 --> 01:48:52,074
"Wait, I bought a brassiere.
It's here.

974
01:48:52,279 --> 01:48:54,304
I got it, I got it.

975
01:48:54,515 --> 01:48:56,106
Here it is!"

976
01:48:58,518 --> 01:49:02,181
- But you don't need one.
- Dad!

977
01:49:02,390 --> 01:49:04,358
Well, she's so beautiful!

978
01:49:05,458 --> 01:49:08,985
Hey, there is no more champagne.
We have to order some more.

979
01:49:09,197 --> 01:49:11,165
Waiter!

980
01:49:17,905 --> 01:49:19,805
This is a waltz.

981
01:49:20,008 --> 01:49:21,600
I've half a mind to...

982
01:49:21,809 --> 01:49:24,642
- Miss, may I have this dance?
- Here I am.

983
01:49:24,847 --> 01:49:26,905
I'm ready too.

984
01:49:28,917 --> 01:49:31,545
What's wrong?
I can manage. I can manage.

985
01:49:42,600 --> 01:49:44,830
You know that when I was a boy...

986
01:49:45,036 --> 01:49:46,900
Paparazzo. Here you go.

987
01:49:47,538 --> 01:49:49,733
When I was a boy,
my father was never at home.

988
01:49:49,941 --> 01:49:53,604
He'd stay away one week, 20 days.
He never came back.

989
01:49:55,315 --> 01:49:57,908
How my mother cried.

990
01:49:58,351 --> 01:50:03,050
I almost never saw him.
I don't really know him.

991
01:50:05,293 --> 01:50:08,284
But I was glad to see him
again tonight.

992
01:50:09,028 --> 01:50:11,121
- He's fun, huh?
- Yes, very.

993
01:50:11,331 --> 01:50:14,391
You have to show him
a good time tonight.

994
01:50:15,536 --> 01:50:16,502
Yes, but...

995
01:50:19,107 --> 01:50:21,575
Maybe this isn't the way
you dance this.

996
01:50:21,776 --> 01:50:24,074
No, don't worry.
I like it better this way.

997
01:50:24,279 --> 01:50:27,839
Oh, yeah? Then let's dance!

998
01:50:28,650 --> 01:50:31,244
- What extraordinary eyes.
- Oh, yeah?

999
01:50:31,454 --> 01:50:35,618
- I'm not sure how to take this.
- It's a sign of my infinite admiration.

1000
01:50:35,824 --> 01:50:38,850
I'm afraid you're just like your son.

1001
01:50:39,061 --> 01:50:41,154
- How am I? Like my son?
- Yes!

1002
01:50:41,364 --> 01:50:43,798
We must be of the same breed, then.

1003
01:50:48,840 --> 01:50:52,571
No, no, no.
You, daddy, come with me!

1004
01:50:52,844 --> 01:50:54,971
Marcello, follow me!

1005
01:50:56,047 --> 01:51:00,484
Be careful, I go very quickly,
even if I don't have an English car.

1006
01:51:01,219 --> 01:51:04,450
You really want to go to her place
to eat spaghetti?

1007
01:51:04,657 --> 01:51:09,252
Yes, yes, he wants to eat spaghetti
Bolognese with me. Go away.

1008
01:51:09,461 --> 01:51:10,485
Here I am!

1009
01:51:10,697 --> 01:51:13,427
Are you comfortable on my carriage?

1010
01:51:13,633 --> 01:51:15,658
- Listen, Dad...
- What is it?

1011
01:51:16,135 --> 01:51:18,797
...is everything all right?
- Yes, I'm in great company.

1012
01:51:19,005 --> 01:51:20,836
- Leave me alone.
- Say, can you drive?

1013
01:51:21,040 --> 01:51:24,168
If you made love the way I drive,
you'd be very happy.

1014
01:51:25,780 --> 01:51:28,771
- Be quiet! Be a good girl.
- You'll wake everybody up!

1015
01:51:30,785 --> 01:51:32,514
Don't go too fast!

1016
01:51:44,101 --> 01:51:44,123
I

1017
01:51:58,648 --> 01:52:01,845
My father is still a good-looking man,
isn't he?

1018
01:52:10,228 --> 01:52:12,162
Gloria, wake up. We're here.

1019
01:52:13,365 --> 01:52:17,528
You took the longest way, you know.
Oh, my foot!

1020
01:52:17,904 --> 01:52:20,668
Why did it take so long?

1021
01:52:21,073 --> 01:52:24,099
- Well, you're not getting out?
- No, I'm not coming.

1022
01:52:24,311 --> 01:52:25,903
Why? What are you, busy?

1023
01:52:26,112 --> 01:52:29,638
I'm tired. Actually, Paparazzo,
you know what?

1024
01:52:29,951 --> 01:52:32,442
I'll leave you the car.
Take my father home.

1025
01:52:32,653 --> 01:52:34,120
Come on, now.

1026
01:52:34,322 --> 01:52:39,691
Listen, tell him I had to stop by
the printing house...

1027
01:52:39,894 --> 01:52:42,419
...and to call me in the morning
before he leaves.

1028
01:52:43,164 --> 01:52:44,859
Come on, why don't you come?

1029
01:52:45,067 --> 01:52:49,935
I don't feel like it. I want to take a walk
in this area. I don't know it very well.

1030
01:52:56,845 --> 01:52:59,643
Where have you been?
I got here half an hour ago!

1031
01:53:03,921 --> 01:53:06,719
- Marcello, your father is sick!
- What?

1032
01:53:07,757 --> 01:53:09,918
He got sick.
Maybe he drank too much.

1033
01:53:10,127 --> 01:53:12,823
- I was going to the pharmacy.
- You left him alone?

1034
01:53:13,031 --> 01:53:15,261
He wants these drops
he wrote down.

1035
01:53:15,902 --> 01:53:18,665
Paparazzo, run to the pharmacy
and get these drops!

1036
01:53:18,870 --> 01:53:20,838
- What?
- Hurry!

1037
01:53:27,813 --> 01:53:30,008
- What floor?
- Third.

1038
01:53:42,195 --> 01:53:43,958
Which door? What's the number?

1039
01:53:44,165 --> 01:53:47,156
Don't scream.
It's a respectable building.

1040
01:53:57,313 --> 01:53:58,507
Father.

1041
01:54:00,216 --> 01:54:02,241
- Turn off the light.
- Yes.

1042
01:54:03,119 --> 01:54:04,950
- Where's the light?
- Over there.

1043
01:54:09,426 --> 01:54:10,950
Wait there.

1044
01:54:11,996 --> 01:54:15,363
My friend went to the pharmacy.
He'll be right back.

1045
01:54:16,300 --> 01:54:20,030
It's nothing. Maybe I drank
a little too much.

1046
01:54:20,237 --> 01:54:22,535
Of course it's nothing.

1047
01:54:26,378 --> 01:54:29,505
You want a glass of water?

1048
01:54:29,982 --> 01:54:32,644
No, no. It'll pass, it'll pass.

1049
01:54:43,796 --> 01:54:46,765
- What happened?
- I don't know. He got sick.

1050
01:54:46,967 --> 01:54:50,333
I was really scared.
Marcello is here now.

1051
01:54:54,743 --> 01:54:59,202
- Can I go in to make some coffee?
- No, he said to wait here.

1052
01:55:11,695 --> 01:55:15,062
What neighborhood is this?
Where are we?

1053
01:55:15,465 --> 01:55:17,262
It is the Italian neighborhood.

1054
01:55:17,833 --> 01:55:20,859
I've never heard of it.
Is it far?

1055
01:55:22,739 --> 01:55:24,798
When I used to come to Rome...

1056
01:55:25,009 --> 01:55:29,604
...I always went to a hotel
close to Piazza Fiume.

1057
01:55:35,688 --> 01:55:37,519
What time is it?

1058
01:55:38,523 --> 01:55:39,990
Almost 4 a.m.

1059
01:55:40,191 --> 01:55:42,751
There's a train at 5:30 a.m.

1060
01:55:43,128 --> 01:55:45,062
I'll have to take that one.

1061
01:55:45,264 --> 01:55:48,494
I can make it.
Yes, I can make it.

1062
01:55:48,701 --> 01:55:52,899
Listen, Dad, why don't you come
to my place. You can rest a bit.

1063
01:55:53,107 --> 01:55:57,669
No, no, no. I'd rather leave.
So I'll be home by 10 a.m.

1064
01:55:57,878 --> 01:56:00,141
- Oh, my watch.
- You can leave later.

1065
01:56:00,347 --> 01:56:01,644
No, no.

1066
01:56:03,217 --> 01:56:05,947
I feel better. I feel a lot better.

1067
01:56:06,153 --> 01:56:10,486
Why don't you stay tomorrow
as well, Dad? Please, stay.

1068
01:56:10,692 --> 01:56:14,924
If you don't want to stay at my place,
maybe you'd prefer your hotel.

1069
01:56:15,131 --> 01:56:16,758
What's the name of it?

1070
01:56:17,834 --> 01:56:21,826
I'll skip work tomorrow and
we can be together all day.

1071
01:56:22,272 --> 01:56:23,967
We can talk, we can...

1072
01:56:26,143 --> 01:56:28,235
We never see each other.

1073
01:56:32,050 --> 01:56:34,917
I have to go. I have to go.

1074
01:56:38,023 --> 01:56:40,081
That's the taxi.

1075
01:56:44,696 --> 01:56:47,597
- Marcello, the taxi is here.
- Which taxi?

1076
01:56:47,799 --> 01:56:51,928
I called it. Where's my hat?

1077
01:56:52,872 --> 01:56:57,639
We could send the taxi away.
Please, go downstairs one moment.

1078
01:56:59,310 --> 01:57:03,508
- Don't leave.
- I want to leave, I want to go home.

1079
01:57:09,089 --> 01:57:13,150
- Good evening, miss.
- Goodbye and lots of luck. Goodbye.

1080
01:57:13,361 --> 01:57:14,828
Bye, Marcello.

1081
01:57:15,029 --> 01:57:18,930
Well, son, I'm happy to have seen you.
Write to us.

1082
01:57:20,402 --> 01:57:25,465
No, don't accompany me.
I prefer going alone, please.

1083
01:57:56,473 --> 01:57:57,667
I'll break your face!

1084
01:58:01,912 --> 01:58:05,712
Think everyone's like her husband, who
gets cuckolded and doesn't complain?!

1085
01:58:05,918 --> 01:58:08,386
He's showing off because
there are women around.

1086
01:58:08,589 --> 01:58:10,613
- What did you say?
- What's going on?

1087
01:58:10,823 --> 01:58:13,348
I don't know, but it was great.
I'll find out.

1088
01:58:13,559 --> 01:58:14,583
Good, find out.

1089
01:58:14,795 --> 01:58:17,093
The fact remains that
what he wrote is true.

1090
01:58:17,297 --> 01:58:21,357
- Come back here, you ugly bastard!
- My mother has lots of money!

1091
01:58:21,569 --> 01:58:23,696
- Nico.
- Marcellino!

1092
01:58:23,905 --> 01:58:26,840
- Bad boy Marcellino!
- How are you?

1093
01:58:27,042 --> 01:58:28,975
- Where are you going?
- To my fiance's castle...

1094
01:58:29,177 --> 01:58:33,614
...in Bassano di Sutri.
- Why don't you take me?

1095
01:58:33,817 --> 01:58:35,648
- Sure.
- Paparazzo was looking for you...

1096
01:58:35,852 --> 01:58:37,820
...he wanted to do a shoot
for Jardin de Mode.

1097
01:58:38,021 --> 01:58:41,217
I haven't taken fashion pictures
in a year. I've had it.

1098
01:58:41,423 --> 01:58:44,415
- Nicolina!
- There they are!

1099
01:58:46,763 --> 01:58:48,788
Nicolina, we're here!

1100
01:58:49,001 --> 01:58:50,991
Is there room for my friend and I?

1101
01:58:51,202 --> 01:58:53,534
- No, try in the other car.
- What a shame.

1102
01:58:54,839 --> 01:58:56,272
See you there. Bye.

1103
01:58:58,142 --> 01:59:01,599
Stop. Is there room
for two unhappy creatures?

1104
01:59:02,847 --> 01:59:06,783
- There is a bigger car behind us.
- Oh, my God.

1105
01:59:08,954 --> 01:59:12,150
Stop, Oliviero.
Can my friend come too?

1106
01:59:12,357 --> 01:59:15,190
- The usual pimps you fall in love with.
- Come, come.

1107
01:59:15,394 --> 01:59:17,692
As soon as we're out of Rome,
you're driving.

1108
01:59:17,898 --> 01:59:20,331
After Capranica,
the olive grove shortcut.

1109
01:59:20,533 --> 01:59:22,899
Follow us!

1110
01:59:31,512 --> 01:59:33,605
Will there still be people
at your father's house?

1111
01:59:33,915 --> 01:59:36,383
Let's hope not,
so we can go to bed early.

1112
01:59:36,584 --> 01:59:39,018
Anyway, only the fossils
must be left at this hour.

1113
01:59:39,221 --> 01:59:44,749
The parties at our house are famous
for being first-class funerals.

1114
01:59:45,796 --> 01:59:47,457
Is your brother hunting?

1115
01:59:47,664 --> 01:59:51,997
- Irene, take this dog-looking thing back.
- Give it to me.

1116
01:59:53,437 --> 01:59:56,497
I woke up and my bed started to shake,

1117
01:59:57,241 --> 01:59:59,539
- What town are we going to?
- Maybe I was just being nervous,

1118
02:00:00,711 --> 02:00:05,080
- What town are we going to?
- Anyway, Bassano di Sutri,

1119
02:00:07,519 --> 02:00:09,384
I am probably going
to be visited by more ghosts,

1120
02:00:09,588 --> 02:00:12,750
Why are you crying? What language
is that? Where are you from?

1121
02:00:12,958 --> 02:00:14,926
Eskimo!

1122
02:00:31,378 --> 02:00:31,400
I

1123
02:00:36,250 --> 02:00:38,980
Beautiful night to all of you!

1124
02:00:45,994 --> 02:00:48,963
What are you doing?
Where are you going with that?

1125
02:00:49,732 --> 02:00:54,759
Careful not to spill everything.
I don't get the meaning of this walk.

1126
02:00:54,971 --> 02:00:58,270
- Hi, Clemente.
- Giulio, look who I brought.

1127
02:01:02,379 --> 02:01:04,347
You big slut.

1128
02:01:08,385 --> 02:01:10,443
Who told you to come here?

1129
02:01:23,735 --> 02:01:25,999
They came from all regions of Italy.

1130
02:01:26,205 --> 02:01:30,334
We were all there. It was a beautiful,
touching ceremony.

1131
02:01:30,575 --> 02:01:35,410
The people bringing flowers
to the tomb of their beloved leader.

1132
02:01:35,614 --> 02:01:37,582
Excuse me. I haven't had
the pleasure of meeting you.

1133
02:01:37,784 --> 02:01:39,081
- I'm the youngest son.
- Rubini, my pleasure.

1134
02:01:39,386 --> 02:01:41,353
The least important, of course.

1135
02:01:42,589 --> 02:01:46,821
You want to meet someone else from
the family? Or have you had enough?

1136
02:01:47,028 --> 02:01:50,428
- Grandma. Grandma!
- No, don't bother.

1137
02:01:50,631 --> 02:01:52,155
Grandma!

1138
02:01:53,568 --> 02:01:56,935
- I'd like you to meet Mr...
- Rubini, pleased to meet you.

1139
02:01:57,307 --> 02:01:58,399
Good, good.

1140
02:01:58,608 --> 02:02:01,303
She's pretending to be asleep
so she doesn't have to talk.

1141
02:02:01,510 --> 02:02:04,035
Let's continue the genealogical tree.

1142
02:02:04,246 --> 02:02:09,206
Father, meet Mr. Rubini, someone
who looks like he has a real job.

1143
02:02:09,419 --> 02:02:12,046
Really? How are you?

1144
02:02:12,322 --> 02:02:18,227
Allow me to introduce you
to one of my son's friends.

1145
02:02:18,429 --> 02:02:21,693
- What a nice-looking young man!
- Are you a journalist?

1146
02:02:21,898 --> 02:02:24,366
I'm beat. I would need a nanny
to take me to bed.

1147
02:02:24,568 --> 02:02:26,502
Do you want to do it, Jane?

1148
02:02:27,372 --> 02:02:30,807
- Will you be my nanny tonight?
- No!

1149
02:02:31,276 --> 02:02:33,972
Lady Rodd, do you ever wash
these dogs? They stink.

1150
02:02:34,347 --> 02:02:37,407
They have a wonderful odor.

1151
02:02:38,384 --> 02:02:42,080
And this is the historic Irene, this year's
debutante. Who I really want to marry...

1152
02:02:42,321 --> 02:02:46,280
- Thanks, I already know who he is.
- Excuse me.

1153
02:02:48,595 --> 02:02:52,291
Come on. I'd like to dance.

1154
02:02:53,132 --> 02:02:55,566
Which of the two was making
advances, you or him?

1155
02:02:55,836 --> 02:02:57,463
Me, of course.

1156
02:03:02,010 --> 02:03:04,945
You really want to see your name
in the papers, huh?

1157
02:03:06,080 --> 02:03:11,210
- Why don't we go somewhere quiet?
- And where would that be?

1158
02:03:15,358 --> 02:03:19,692
My first husband was a journalist.
His news was always exaggerated.

1159
02:03:19,896 --> 02:03:24,423
Poor me, I only realized it
at the end of our honeymoon.

1160
02:03:27,271 --> 02:03:30,604
It's better to have exaggerated news
than no news at all.

1161
02:03:30,809 --> 02:03:33,470
My husband feels the same.

1162
02:03:34,612 --> 02:03:37,911
Often, the public demands
these augmentations.

1163
02:03:38,117 --> 02:03:40,244
Personally, if you allow me...

1164
02:03:40,453 --> 02:03:43,819
...I could give you some news
that isn't so exaggerated.

1165
02:03:48,928 --> 02:03:50,520
I know this perfume.

1166
02:03:50,730 --> 02:03:52,128
Maddalena!

1167
02:03:52,331 --> 02:03:54,891
Where did they find you?

1168
02:03:55,835 --> 02:03:59,066
I'm fine, I'm just drunk.
Did you know Jane?

1169
02:03:59,273 --> 02:04:00,240
No.

1170
02:04:00,441 --> 02:04:04,672
She's an American painter
who lives in Rome.

1171
02:04:04,878 --> 02:04:06,436
- Really?
- Everyone invites her...

1172
02:04:06,647 --> 02:04:11,413
...to hear the dirty things she says.
You'll see, she's very funny.

1173
02:04:12,721 --> 02:04:14,882
Those are the Montalbanos.

1174
02:04:15,658 --> 02:04:19,185
Federica, the wolf.
She likes to milk the young ones.

1175
02:04:19,395 --> 02:04:20,362
The Confalonieris:

1176
02:04:20,563 --> 02:04:23,463
They own half of Calabria and
the nicest flats in Rome.

1177
02:04:24,367 --> 02:04:29,134
Little Eleonora: 80,000 hectares,
two attempted suicides.

1178
02:04:29,373 --> 02:04:31,932
The Sanseverinos:
Magnificent castle in Tuscany.

1179
02:04:32,141 --> 02:04:35,508
And that's Don Giulio and Nico,
his Swedish friend.

1180
02:04:35,711 --> 02:04:38,407
Next year she'll be a princess,
you'll see.

1181
02:04:38,616 --> 02:04:43,109
Don't make that face.
Do you think we're any better?

1182
02:04:43,320 --> 02:04:46,619
At least they do certain things
with elegance.

1183
02:04:52,665 --> 02:04:56,931
- That villa in the park, who lives there?
- Nobody. It's vacant.

1184
02:04:57,737 --> 02:05:00,103
It's the nicest, as far as style goes.

1185
02:05:02,575 --> 02:05:06,136
I'm vacant too, you know?

1186
02:05:09,950 --> 02:05:12,349
And what is this gynaeceum?

1187
02:05:13,154 --> 02:05:15,816
Great-grandmothers,
great-great-grandmothers.

1188
02:05:18,327 --> 02:05:22,558
Beautiful women. They all have
the same eyes, did you notice?

1189
02:05:26,001 --> 02:05:29,061
You know, Maddalena,
I thought of you often.

1190
02:05:29,271 --> 02:05:32,239
- I don't understand you.
- Really?

1191
02:05:36,379 --> 02:05:37,744
Neither do I.

1192
02:05:40,250 --> 02:05:42,240
It doesn't matter.

1193
02:05:44,354 --> 02:05:48,017
If you're trying to talk seriously,
I don't want to hear it.

1194
02:05:50,195 --> 02:05:51,924
How is your friend?

1195
02:05:53,198 --> 02:05:56,599
- Are you afraid of serious talks?
- No!

1196
02:05:57,236 --> 02:06:00,034
You don't know how to talk seriously,
do you?

1197
02:06:00,673 --> 02:06:02,606
Where are you taking me?

1198
02:06:04,177 --> 02:06:07,669
Here. This is the room
for serious talks.

1199
02:06:08,583 --> 02:06:11,643
- Have a seat.
- What are we doing?

1200
02:06:13,253 --> 02:06:14,845
Where are you going?

1201
02:06:36,244 --> 02:06:37,609
Marcello?

1202
02:06:38,647 --> 02:06:40,342
Marcello, can you hear me?

1203
02:06:41,417 --> 02:06:44,408
Did you ever feel me so close?

1204
02:06:45,587 --> 02:06:47,054
Where are you?

1205
02:06:47,958 --> 02:06:50,051
- Can you hear me?
- Yes.

1206
02:06:50,261 --> 02:06:51,523
Where are you talking from?

1207
02:06:51,729 --> 02:06:54,788
From a faraway place,
very far away.

1208
02:06:54,999 --> 02:06:59,026
It'd be as if I didn't exist anymore,
if I were not to speak.

1209
02:07:03,442 --> 02:07:07,811
Maddalena. Maddalena!

1210
02:07:14,486 --> 02:07:17,455
Yes, I'm still here. Don't move.

1211
02:07:20,961 --> 02:07:22,791
Would you marry me?

1212
02:07:25,432 --> 02:07:30,529
- And you?
- Yes, I'm in love with you, Marcello.

1213
02:07:31,673 --> 02:07:32,764
Since when?

1214
02:07:34,542 --> 02:07:36,100
Listen.

1215
02:07:36,845 --> 02:07:39,746
- You know what this noise is?
- I don't know.

1216
02:07:40,648 --> 02:07:42,639
And now? Guess.

1217
02:07:45,354 --> 02:07:48,517
- A kiss?
- For you, Marcello.

1218
02:07:48,724 --> 02:07:52,660
So will you marry me?
Or are you afraid to answer?

1219
02:07:54,530 --> 02:07:57,556
Why this question?
Are you a bit drunk?

1220
02:07:57,900 --> 02:07:59,629
Yes, a little.

1221
02:08:00,937 --> 02:08:02,802
I love you, Marcello.

1222
02:08:07,945 --> 02:08:11,142
You know, I'd like to be your wife,
be faithful.

1223
02:08:11,349 --> 02:08:16,718
I'd like everything. I'd like to be your
wife and to have fun like a whore.

1224
02:08:17,289 --> 02:08:21,487
Tonight, I don't know why, I feel like
I love you a lot, like I need you.

1225
02:08:21,961 --> 02:08:24,656
- Is that true?
- Yes, it's true.

1226
02:08:25,064 --> 02:08:28,591
I don't know if you're just playing,
but it doesn't matter.

1227
02:08:28,802 --> 02:08:31,999
I love you.
I only want to be with you.

1228
02:08:32,207 --> 02:08:33,935
You'd hate me after a month.

1229
02:08:35,176 --> 02:08:36,837
Why should I hate you?

1230
02:08:37,946 --> 02:08:40,813
Because one can't have everything.
You can have one thing or the other.

1231
02:08:41,017 --> 02:08:45,350
For me, it's too late to choose. And
I've never wanted to make a choice.

1232
02:08:45,553 --> 02:08:50,547
I'm a whore, you know.
It's hopeless, I'll always be a whore.

1233
02:08:50,958 --> 02:08:53,517
- And I don't want to be anything else!
- No, it's not true.

1234
02:08:54,361 --> 02:08:57,228
You're an extraordinary girl, Maddalena.
I know this.

1235
02:08:58,701 --> 02:09:01,636
Your courage, your sincerity...

1236
02:09:01,837 --> 02:09:04,134
Really, I need you.

1237
02:09:05,374 --> 02:09:10,334
Your desperation gives me strength.
You'd be a marvelous companion.

1238
02:09:10,547 --> 02:09:14,846
Because I could tell you everything.
You know everything.

1239
02:09:16,220 --> 02:09:20,020
Maddalena, are you listening?
Answer me.

1240
02:09:20,960 --> 02:09:25,919
Maddalena, enough playing.
Come back. I want to talk to you more.

1241
02:09:46,153 --> 02:09:48,087
We're going on a ghost hunt
at the old villa.

1242
02:09:48,289 --> 02:09:50,484
Is Maddalena with you?

1243
02:10:06,241 --> 02:10:10,701
Giulio, tell everyone to be careful.
You know that the bridge is rotted.

1244
02:10:17,688 --> 02:10:19,451
Once in '22, when I came to Rome...

1245
02:10:19,657 --> 02:10:22,785
...I spent a night in a castle
like this near Genzano.

1246
02:10:22,994 --> 02:10:27,259
You know, once, in my sister-in-law's
castle, we saw a little girl with a candle.

1247
02:10:27,465 --> 02:10:30,525
- Then we found out it wasn't a little girl.
- What do you mean?

1248
02:10:30,735 --> 02:10:34,795
- Nor was it a candle.
- Oh, please! Don't be silly, now.

1249
02:10:55,796 --> 02:11:00,699
- I'm ready to bet that when I'm dead...
- Listen to the silence!

1250
02:11:00,902 --> 02:11:03,928
- Look, there's a light!
- It's the reflection of the candles.

1251
02:11:04,138 --> 02:11:06,766
You have such lack of fantasy.

1252
02:11:06,974 --> 02:11:10,774
Don't you all remember the story that
the farmers tell about the hunchback?

1253
02:11:10,979 --> 02:11:16,507
- Giulio, don't you have electricity here?
- Watch out for the bats, Jane.

1254
02:11:16,719 --> 02:11:20,018
Bats? They're my favorite subjects.

1255
02:11:20,322 --> 02:11:23,553
Nicolina, be careful, the honorable
is going to jump you in there!

1256
02:11:23,760 --> 02:11:26,694
Honey, the door is closed.
There is no key.

1257
02:11:26,896 --> 02:11:29,865
It must be here on the floor.
Give me some light.

1258
02:11:30,901 --> 02:11:32,562
You know, I can't find it.

1259
02:11:34,738 --> 02:11:36,399
- It's not here.
- So?

1260
02:11:36,607 --> 02:11:38,302
- So we'll go back.
- Let's break it down.

1261
02:11:38,510 --> 02:11:41,479
- Here's the key!
- Give it here.

1262
02:11:41,681 --> 02:11:44,377
- Good job, Nicolina.
- Who found it? Nicolina?

1263
02:11:45,117 --> 02:11:47,551
When was the last time
you came here?

1264
02:11:47,754 --> 02:11:49,244
It's been more than two years.

1265
02:11:49,455 --> 02:11:52,219
- What do you use it for?
- I'd make it into a great flat...

1266
02:11:52,426 --> 02:11:55,758
...but Father didn't want to hear it.
- So, what's next for the great journalist?

1267
02:11:55,963 --> 02:11:58,761
A nice third-page article on the stupid
and corrupted aristocracy?

1268
02:11:58,967 --> 02:12:02,903
First of all, I write other things, and then,
you're really not that interesting.

1269
02:12:03,103 --> 02:12:06,367
- Who did Maddalena come with?
- Who's Maddalena?

1270
02:12:07,208 --> 02:12:09,472
Be careful,
this place must be full of rats...

1271
02:12:09,677 --> 02:12:11,474
...cockroaches, snakes and vampires.

1272
02:12:11,679 --> 02:12:15,239
- And now even full of sluts.
- Thanks a lot.

1273
02:12:17,952 --> 02:12:20,819
I'll go first and light the way
for everyone.

1274
02:12:21,857 --> 02:12:25,519
- Giulio, when was this house built?
- Five centuries ago. In 1500.

1275
02:12:25,727 --> 02:12:28,355
- Who built it?
- Pope Giulio II.

1276
02:12:28,564 --> 02:12:31,055
- You had a pope in the family?
- We had two of them!

1277
02:12:31,267 --> 02:12:34,361
- Countess Cristina!
- Irene, if you are scared, come to me.

1278
02:12:34,571 --> 02:12:37,061
Two popes, my love.

1279
02:12:37,407 --> 02:12:41,901
Come, I'll be your guide.
This way. Come, this way.

1280
02:12:42,246 --> 02:12:44,806
Giulio, we're sweeping the floor
with our gowns here.

1281
02:12:45,016 --> 02:12:49,146
- Oh, Irene, I could love you up here.
- You clown!

1282
02:12:52,258 --> 02:12:55,249
Allow me to say that you're
an incredible vision.

1283
02:12:55,461 --> 02:12:57,986
You look like you stepped out
of a painting.

1284
02:13:09,509 --> 02:13:12,307
What a disaster.

1285
02:13:13,514 --> 02:13:16,744
This place is falling apart.

1286
02:13:22,023 --> 02:13:26,083
Giulio, it's such a shame to see
everything's crumbling here.

1287
02:13:26,695 --> 02:13:31,928
But you're never around. You're always
in Rome and you don't take care of it.

1288
02:13:32,235 --> 02:13:37,467
- What should I do, Father?
- This place will be yours someday.

1289
02:13:38,541 --> 02:13:42,477
- Giulio, I'm your ancestor.
- Get lost, you idiot.

1290
02:13:47,718 --> 02:13:51,779
Irene, please, if you see a ghost,
throw yourself into my arms.

1291
02:13:59,430 --> 02:14:03,764
Eugenio, enough! Try to be serious,
otherwise go away!

1292
02:14:03,970 --> 02:14:06,597
- Is your aunt a medium?
- Didn't you know?

1293
02:14:06,805 --> 02:14:10,707
Her husband left her because
he always found some ghost in bed.

1294
02:14:10,911 --> 02:14:12,640
Yes, I remember.

1295
02:14:13,512 --> 02:14:17,140
And yet I've met you someplace before.
You don't forget a face like yours.

1296
02:14:17,350 --> 02:14:20,251
Perhaps, I work. You might've
seen me in some office.

1297
02:14:20,454 --> 02:14:22,581
- You work?
- Yes.

1298
02:14:23,824 --> 02:14:26,257
Who are we trying to summon?

1299
02:14:28,529 --> 02:14:30,929
- You're such a jerk.
- Cristina's making me laugh!

1300
02:14:31,133 --> 02:14:33,328
- It's not true!
- Cristina!

1301
02:14:34,270 --> 02:14:35,237
Who are you?

1302
02:14:37,707 --> 02:14:39,800
Who do you want
to communicate with?

1303
02:14:40,043 --> 02:14:42,170
I feel some energy...

1304
02:14:42,378 --> 02:14:45,142
Countess, keep the contact.
Don't laugh!

1305
02:14:45,348 --> 02:14:46,314
I'm not laughing.

1306
02:14:46,515 --> 02:14:51,418
Do you have a message for one of us?
Give me an answer.

1307
02:14:51,621 --> 02:14:56,887
What is that light down there that's
blinking always in the same place?

1308
02:14:57,093 --> 02:15:01,223
Don't be frightened. It's a tractor.
In the summer, they also work at night.

1309
02:15:04,536 --> 02:15:06,696
- Call Sister Edvige!
- Who is she?

1310
02:15:06,905 --> 02:15:09,430
It's a nun that in the summer,
walks around here...

1311
02:15:09,641 --> 02:15:12,405
...carrying her head on a dish.
- Yeah, right.

1312
02:15:13,279 --> 02:15:18,113
Is it still you?
Why don't you leave me alone?

1313
02:15:18,317 --> 02:15:21,445
- Go away, I beg you!
- Extraordinary.

1314
02:15:21,787 --> 02:15:24,051
Ask if it's the same person
as last time.

1315
02:15:24,257 --> 02:15:29,159
I feel your breath inside my lungs.
Your blood inside my veins!

1316
02:15:32,867 --> 02:15:34,960
She's just drunk. She's drunk.

1317
02:15:41,042 --> 02:15:43,533
- Why is she doing that?
- Easy, easy...

1318
02:15:43,745 --> 02:15:47,441
- Blow out the candles!
- Mommy, I want life.

1319
02:15:47,649 --> 02:15:49,879
Blow them out. Blow them out.

1320
02:15:51,621 --> 02:15:54,886
I want love. I want life.
I want to...

1321
02:15:55,091 --> 02:15:59,117
- Who are you? Tell me who you are.
- I want truth!

1322
02:16:02,166 --> 02:16:03,861
Who do you
want to communicate with?

1323
02:16:04,068 --> 02:16:06,797
- Giulio.
- With Giulio?

1324
02:16:07,138 --> 02:16:10,107
Giulio, there's a message for you.

1325
02:16:10,941 --> 02:16:14,069
That sleaze is in love with you.

1326
02:16:15,248 --> 02:16:17,841
Giulio, you can't escape my love.

1327
02:16:19,318 --> 02:16:23,448
- That's enough, now. Turn on the lights!
- Irene, don't be stupid. We're joking.

1328
02:16:23,655 --> 02:16:26,714
Irene. Irene, come here.

1329
02:16:31,230 --> 02:16:33,721
Who are you, poor soul?

1330
02:16:33,1000 --> 02:16:35,831
Why are you crying?

1331
02:16:39,405 --> 02:16:41,270
Why are you crying?

1332
02:16:51,019 --> 02:16:53,715
Wait, I'll make some light.

1333
02:17:13,945 --> 02:17:15,412
No, not here.

1334
02:17:15,613 --> 02:17:21,448
No, love. What are you doing?
Crazy! You're crazy, darling!

1335
02:17:37,368 --> 02:17:40,633
Do you know this is the first time
I've seen the dawn?

1336
02:17:57,259 --> 02:17:59,693
Marcello, have you met my son?

1337
02:18:07,003 --> 02:18:10,665
Shall we go eat some spaghetti?

1338
02:18:16,380 --> 02:18:19,177
He's nothing but a thief.
Eggs at 45 lira each!

1339
02:18:19,383 --> 02:18:22,875
Forget it. From now on,
we'll buy them in Capranica.

1340
02:18:24,756 --> 02:18:26,053
Hello, Mom.

1341
02:18:26,257 --> 02:18:28,247
You're still running around
at this hour?

1342
02:18:28,860 --> 02:18:31,351
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1343
02:18:32,430 --> 02:18:34,227
I'll go with you.

1344
02:18:34,933 --> 02:18:39,028
- Did you sleep well, Mother?
- Do you still feel like a kid or what?

1345
02:18:39,604 --> 02:18:41,936
We were at the old villa.

1346
02:18:42,141 --> 02:18:45,042
Is that crazy Francesca there too?
Tell her to come to mass.

1347
02:18:45,277 --> 02:18:48,712
- Who is she?
- She's the princess mother.

1348
02:19:00,260 --> 02:19:00,282
I

1349
02:19:01,861 --> 02:19:05,319
What have I done
to be treated this way?

1350
02:19:05,766 --> 02:19:10,566
Not even a dog gets treated like this.
Who do you think you are?

1351
02:19:12,975 --> 02:19:15,808
If you loved me half as much
as I love you...

1352
02:19:16,012 --> 02:19:18,605
...you'd understand some things.
- Yes.

1353
02:19:18,981 --> 02:19:21,575
But you can't. Because
you don't love anyone.

1354
02:19:21,784 --> 02:19:23,809
- Don't scream.
- You can't even fathom...

1355
02:19:24,021 --> 02:19:26,489
...what it means to love someone!
- But you do, right?

1356
02:19:26,691 --> 02:19:31,525
You're selfish, that's what you are.
Your heart is locked, empty.

1357
02:19:31,730 --> 02:19:35,427
You only care about women,
you think that's love.

1358
02:19:35,634 --> 02:19:39,831
Yes, I know. You've been saying it
for four hours. I can't take it anymore!

1359
02:19:40,038 --> 02:19:42,199
- I want to go home!
- Not all men are like you.

1360
02:19:42,407 --> 02:19:45,808
Some men are happy to find
someone who loves them...

1361
02:19:46,011 --> 02:19:48,478
...and they don't go looking
for other women!

1362
02:19:48,712 --> 02:19:53,979
It's you. You're the only one like this.
It's a disgrace. A disgrace.

1363
02:19:54,186 --> 02:20:00,351
No, I'm a disgrace.
And my disgrace is having met you!

1364
02:20:00,559 --> 02:20:02,925
I can't stand
having you around anymore!

1365
02:20:03,129 --> 02:20:07,361
Go away!
Go away once and forever!

1366
02:20:13,374 --> 02:20:15,001
Where're you going, stupid?
Come here.

1367
02:20:15,476 --> 02:20:19,138
No. Leave me alone! Let me live!

1368
02:20:27,291 --> 02:20:29,884
Come on, you fool, get in.

1369
02:20:30,260 --> 02:20:31,488
No!

1370
02:20:31,695 --> 02:20:33,492
Look, Emma, I'll...

1371
02:20:40,338 --> 02:20:41,498
Come on, get in.

1372
02:20:42,440 --> 02:20:45,876
What do you want from me?
What are you looking for?

1373
02:20:46,877 --> 02:20:49,572
You're a slime. You're pitiful.

1374
02:20:49,780 --> 02:20:52,112
You'll end up alone like a dog!

1375
02:20:54,652 --> 02:20:56,415
You'll see.

1376
02:20:56,621 --> 02:21:00,488
Who's going to stay with you
if I leave you?

1377
02:21:02,394 --> 02:21:07,889
What are you going to do with your life?
Who could love you like I do?

1378
02:21:08,102 --> 02:21:10,968
I can't spend my life loving you.

1379
02:21:11,738 --> 02:21:17,608
You always say that I'm the crazy one,
that I live in a dream, outside reality.

1380
02:21:18,513 --> 02:21:21,710
But you're the one who's off the road.

1381
02:21:22,250 --> 02:21:26,084
Don't you see that you've already found
the most important thing in life?

1382
02:21:26,288 --> 02:21:29,450
A woman who really loves you,
who'd give her life for you.

1383
02:21:29,657 --> 02:21:31,852
As if you were the only one
in the world.

1384
02:21:33,329 --> 02:21:35,456
You ruin everything.

1385
02:21:35,732 --> 02:21:39,599
You're always cross, always unhappy.

1386
02:21:43,306 --> 02:21:44,898
Marcello...

1387
02:21:46,344 --> 02:21:50,336
...when two people love each other,
nothing else matters.

1388
02:21:50,915 --> 02:21:53,611
What are you afraid of?

1389
02:21:54,385 --> 02:21:59,219
Of you. Of your selfishness, of the
miserable bleakness of your ideals.

1390
02:21:59,424 --> 02:22:02,325
Don't you see that you offer me
the life of a spineless worm?

1391
02:22:02,527 --> 02:22:04,927
You can only talk of cooking and bed.

1392
02:22:05,130 --> 02:22:06,927
A man who accepts to live like this...

1393
02:22:07,132 --> 02:22:10,623
...is a finished man,
he's nothing but a worm!

1394
02:22:11,236 --> 02:22:15,366
I don't believe in your aggressive,
sticky, maternal love!

1395
02:22:15,575 --> 02:22:18,066
I don't want it! I have no use for it!

1396
02:22:18,579 --> 02:22:21,445
This isn't love, it's brutalization!

1397
02:22:21,681 --> 02:22:23,911
When will you understand
that I can't live like this?!

1398
02:22:24,117 --> 02:22:27,314
That I don't want to be with
you anymore?! I want to be alone!

1399
02:22:27,688 --> 02:22:29,985
- Get out of this car!
- No!

1400
02:22:30,190 --> 02:22:33,125
You're a beast, a coward.
I feel sorry for you.

1401
02:22:33,528 --> 02:22:36,463
Yeah, well, and you make me sick.
Get out!

1402
02:22:36,665 --> 02:22:39,633
No, I'm not going.
I'm staying with you!

1403
02:22:39,901 --> 02:22:42,802
No, Emma, you're not staying
with me any longer. Get out.

1404
02:22:43,005 --> 02:22:44,267
No!

1405
02:22:52,316 --> 02:22:53,908
- Get out of the car.
- No!

1406
02:22:54,118 --> 02:22:56,882
Get out of the car!
It's over, don't you get...

1407
02:22:58,922 --> 02:23:03,051
- It's over. Get lost! Go away!
- Scoundrel!

1408
02:23:03,261 --> 02:23:07,197
That's what you are, a scoundrel.
Bastard!

1409
02:23:08,400 --> 02:23:11,300
- Damn you!
- I never want to see you again.

1410
02:23:12,737 --> 02:23:17,140
- Get a truck driver to pick you up, slut!
- Go, go with your whores!

1411
02:24:25,151 --> 02:24:26,482
Hello?

1412
02:24:30,856 --> 02:24:32,289
Where?

1413
02:24:41,067 --> 02:24:43,262
Where are you going?
You can't go through here.

1414
02:24:43,471 --> 02:24:44,961
Go ahead.

1415
02:24:45,807 --> 02:24:48,935
Clear the way!
Let him through!

1416
02:24:52,647 --> 02:24:55,775
- A real monstrosity, Marcello.
- What happened?

1417
02:24:58,153 --> 02:24:59,142
Tiziano!

1418
02:24:59,589 --> 02:25:02,921
He killed his two children,
then he killed himself!

1419
02:25:10,666 --> 02:25:13,328
Marcello, let me in.
Tell them I'm your photographer.

1420
02:25:13,536 --> 02:25:16,130
I'll give the pictures
to your paper for cheap.

1421
02:25:16,340 --> 02:25:19,036
Let me go in with you.
Come on, Marcello, let me in.

1422
02:25:19,243 --> 02:25:22,075
- I'm a friend. I must get in.
- Just a moment.

1423
02:25:24,115 --> 02:25:27,312
There's a young man who says
he's Mr. Steiner's friend.

1424
02:25:27,520 --> 02:25:28,851
Let him in.

1425
02:25:37,563 --> 02:25:39,155
Come in.

1426
02:25:42,368 --> 02:25:46,304
Distance between the floor
and the bullet hole: 1.5 meters.

1427
02:25:48,307 --> 02:25:52,265
Distance between the left wall
and the bullet hole: 4 meters.

1428
02:25:52,879 --> 02:25:54,073
Did you write it down?

1429
02:25:55,316 --> 02:25:59,150
No, the wife doesn't know anything.
She's not here. She'll be back at 1:00.

1430
02:26:00,755 --> 02:26:03,553
Apparently, before the killings...

1431
02:26:03,758 --> 02:26:07,387
...he called a close friend,
begging her to go and meet his wife.

1432
02:26:07,596 --> 02:26:12,828
Distance between the back wall
and the bullet hole: 5 meters.

1433
02:26:15,337 --> 02:26:17,999
Let's listen to that again.
Rewind.

1434
02:26:23,715 --> 02:26:28,550
You are the true primitive,
as primitive as a Gothic spire,

1435
02:26:28,754 --> 02:26:33,349
You're so tall that you can 't hear
any more voices up there,

1436
02:26:33,558 --> 02:26:39,121
If you could see my real height,
you'll see I'm not much taller than this:

1437
02:26:42,267 --> 02:26:44,735
Were you a friend of the Steiner family?

1438
02:26:45,270 --> 02:26:47,204
I was a friend of Steiner's.

1439
02:26:47,640 --> 02:26:51,439
- Since when? Were you a close friend?
- Did you see him lately?

1440
02:26:51,644 --> 02:26:53,339
Can you tell us about it?

1441
02:26:54,614 --> 02:26:58,914
No. I was his friend,
but we didn't see each other often.

1442
02:26:59,120 --> 02:27:01,019
I don't know anything.

1443
02:27:03,357 --> 02:27:04,756
Anything at all.

1444
02:27:06,127 --> 02:27:08,687
- 3. 10 meters.
- 3. 10 meters.

1445
02:27:09,098 --> 02:27:10,395
Foggia!

1446
02:27:16,439 --> 02:27:20,341
Did you notice if there was
something strange in his life?

1447
02:27:21,009 --> 02:27:26,037
- I don't know, financial problems?
- No, I don't think so.

1448
02:27:26,249 --> 02:27:28,877
Had he ever shown suicidal behavior?

1449
02:27:30,686 --> 02:27:32,152
- I don't know.
- Well...

1450
02:27:32,355 --> 02:27:34,983
...please stay available,
we may need you later.

1451
02:27:35,391 --> 02:27:37,416
Mondini, get the gun.

1452
02:27:37,629 --> 02:27:42,725
- A cheerful person, full of love
and attention for the family he adored.

1453
02:27:42,934 --> 02:27:46,301
His was almost a morbid adulation.

1454
02:27:47,338 --> 02:27:47,360
I

1455
02:27:51,510 --> 02:27:56,140
The weapon used, a brand-new
revolver, type Browning.675...

1456
02:27:56,349 --> 02:28:01,718
...was found near his body, which lies
in an armchair next to the fireplace...

1457
02:28:01,922 --> 02:28:04,618
...in a peculiar position.

1458
02:28:12,567 --> 02:28:15,502
I'm done. I'll see him later
at the morgue with the children.

1459
02:28:15,703 --> 02:28:17,796
Fine. Thanks.

1460
02:28:18,172 --> 02:28:21,107
- Can we cover him again, doctor?
- Yes.

1461
02:28:22,044 --> 02:28:23,102
De Angelis.

1462
02:28:30,352 --> 02:28:32,512
Are they done
with the pictures in there?

1463
02:28:32,720 --> 02:28:35,052
Do you want to go
into the children's room?

1464
02:28:35,258 --> 02:28:36,725
This way.

1465
02:28:38,963 --> 02:28:43,695
Doctor, it's 12:15. I must go to
the bus stop and meet his wife.

1466
02:28:43,900 --> 02:28:47,461
I'll take someone from the building,
because I don't know her.

1467
02:28:48,105 --> 02:28:50,369
- I'll come.
- Thank you.

1468
02:28:51,476 --> 02:28:52,773
- Let's go right away.
- Yes.

1469
02:28:52,978 --> 02:28:55,640
Polacci, when you're done,
meet me at the bus stop.

1470
02:28:55,848 --> 02:28:59,147
If someone comes here from the station,
call me at the office.

1471
02:29:27,849 --> 02:29:31,580
Guys, some compassion, please.
At least this one time.

1472
02:29:31,919 --> 02:29:36,356
Try to talk to your colleagues,
they're really exaggerating now!

1473
02:29:46,670 --> 02:29:49,195
Maybe he was just afraid.

1474
02:29:50,174 --> 02:29:54,132
You're talking about Steiner?
Had he been threatened?

1475
02:29:54,345 --> 02:29:57,007
No, not in the way you mean.

1476
02:29:58,249 --> 02:30:01,582
Maybe he was afraid of himself...

1477
02:30:01,787 --> 02:30:03,515
...of us all.

1478
02:30:05,190 --> 02:30:07,681
When is she coming?

1479
02:30:32,954 --> 02:30:34,717
That's her.

1480
02:30:35,657 --> 02:30:37,818
- Please come with me.
- Yes.

1481
02:30:46,535 --> 02:30:49,868
What? Did you mistake me
for an actress?

1482
02:30:50,473 --> 02:30:52,906
What are you doing?
What do you want?

1483
02:30:53,108 --> 02:30:55,167
Enough, guys. Get lost!

1484
02:30:55,378 --> 02:30:58,040
- Hi, Marcello. What is it?
- Good morning. I'm Mr. Lucenti.

1485
02:30:58,247 --> 02:31:02,115
- We must speak with you alone.
- Alone? Did something happen?

1486
02:31:02,320 --> 02:31:05,584
No. Be so kind as to follow us, please.
My car is right here.

1487
02:31:05,790 --> 02:31:07,280
- Why?
- There's been a tragedy.

1488
02:31:07,492 --> 02:31:10,086
- What happened?
- Don't be scared, ma'am.

1489
02:31:11,062 --> 02:31:13,791
- The children!
- Follow us, please. Get lost, guys!

1490
02:31:13,999 --> 02:31:16,331
What happened?
Marcello, you have to tell me!

1491
02:31:16,535 --> 02:31:20,767
You'll see them later. They're hurt.
They're just hurt. But I promise you...

1492
02:31:20,974 --> 02:31:23,737
- Enough!
- What do you mean, hurt? Tell me!

1493
02:31:23,943 --> 02:31:25,205
Get out of here!

1494
02:32:09,460 --> 02:32:12,190
Marcello!

1495
02:32:20,573 --> 02:32:23,234
- Stop, will you?
- What do we do about the key?

1496
02:32:24,309 --> 02:32:27,107
You guys didn't want to wait.

1497
02:32:33,452 --> 02:32:36,944
Go in with the car.
Break the gate open, come on!

1498
02:32:37,157 --> 02:32:39,352
Hey, get out of there!

1499
02:32:52,373 --> 02:32:53,999
Go ahead. It's open.

1500
02:32:54,208 --> 02:32:58,770
Oh, look at the colors! How wonderful.
What are you doing? Are you playing?

1501
02:33:01,183 --> 02:33:04,015
Carlo, come and see.
Marcello is going to break the glass!

1502
02:33:04,219 --> 02:33:05,686
One, two, three!

1503
02:33:07,556 --> 02:33:11,048
To Nadia's health and her
newfound freedom!

1504
02:33:11,262 --> 02:33:13,320
To the annulment of her marriage!

1505
02:33:13,530 --> 02:33:16,556
To the annulment of her husband
and of everything else!

1506
02:33:16,767 --> 02:33:19,065
Thanks! Thanks to everyone!

1507
02:33:19,570 --> 02:33:25,769
This marriage experience brings me
back to my old friends filled with desire.

1508
02:33:25,976 --> 02:33:30,743
- Kind of like being a virgin again.
- It's a wonderful sensation.

1509
02:33:30,949 --> 02:33:34,975
You have to be married first
to appreciate it. Right, my love?

1510
02:33:35,187 --> 02:33:38,054
- Be quiet. I'm confessing Lucia.
- I want to hear too.

1511
02:33:39,259 --> 02:33:40,658
Put on "Jingle Bells"!

1512
02:33:40,961 --> 02:33:42,758
Hey, are you two done confessing?

1513
02:33:42,963 --> 02:33:45,487
Today, making love
privately is insulting!

1514
02:33:46,800 --> 02:33:48,290
Here they are!

1515
02:33:50,438 --> 02:33:53,736
Don't make fun of them, because
one of them is the senator's lover.

1516
02:33:55,310 --> 02:33:57,039
Great! Beautiful!

1517
02:34:01,183 --> 02:34:03,151
Who brought these guys?

1518
02:34:04,619 --> 02:34:07,611
These two will be dead
before Christmas.

1519
02:34:11,460 --> 02:34:16,055
Say, weren't you a writer once,
a man of letters, am I right?

1520
02:34:16,264 --> 02:34:18,892
I announce that I left literature
and journalism.

1521
02:34:19,101 --> 02:34:22,832
I'm a publicity agent.
And with great satisfaction.

1522
02:34:24,140 --> 02:34:28,076
It's true that to survive one has to write
anything, but this is pretty bleak.

1523
02:34:28,278 --> 02:34:29,506
Listen, everyone:

1524
02:34:29,780 --> 02:34:33,648
"He has a Greek profile,
but the modernity of his expression...

1525
02:34:33,850 --> 02:34:38,583
...brings him next to the most modern
actor of our time, Paul Newman."

1526
02:34:38,790 --> 02:34:40,815
- Marcello, you're a slime!
- Listen...

1527
02:34:41,594 --> 02:34:45,689
...why don't you tell us what you'd
be capable of doing for an interview.

1528
02:34:46,032 --> 02:34:51,026
- You wish I'd write that for you, huh?
- Oh, how awful. You'd ruin my career.

1529
02:34:51,237 --> 02:34:53,797
Lf, instead of 250,
I gave you 300,000 lira a month...

1530
02:34:54,008 --> 02:34:55,908
...what would you write about me?

1531
02:34:56,277 --> 02:35:00,304
- That you're Marlon Brando.
- And if I gave you 400,000?

1532
02:35:00,681 --> 02:35:03,149
- John Barrymore.
- And a million lira?

1533
02:35:04,083 --> 02:35:05,573
First give me the million.

1534
02:35:09,691 --> 02:35:12,057
You don't know anything!
Go to school!

1535
02:35:14,596 --> 02:35:18,032
What kind of joke is that?
If he's hurt, you'll have to support him.

1536
02:35:18,233 --> 02:35:20,167
I saw you trip him!

1537
02:35:27,243 --> 02:35:30,235
You're a real asshole, though.
You people invited us here.

1538
02:35:30,446 --> 02:35:34,041
Now we're taking our things and
we're leaving. Great party you'll have!

1539
02:35:46,197 --> 02:35:49,564
I've never seen such boring people.

1540
02:35:49,768 --> 02:35:52,862
Our guest of honor is bored,
she needs to have a good time.

1541
02:35:53,073 --> 02:35:55,632
For once, you're right.
Why don't you strip.

1542
02:35:55,841 --> 02:35:58,309
Oh, yeah, your intellectual chest
isn't sexy.

1543
02:35:58,577 --> 02:36:02,513
If you put some Middle Eastern
music on, I can do a great striptease.

1544
02:36:02,849 --> 02:36:05,339
No, give me a break,
we've all seen you naked.

1545
02:36:05,552 --> 02:36:07,281
Come on, let me do it.

1546
02:36:07,554 --> 02:36:11,991
I didn't see you.
But I propose the panther do it.

1547
02:36:12,460 --> 02:36:15,189
Here's Caterina,
who's going to strip for us.

1548
02:36:15,428 --> 02:36:17,988
No, too much technique.
She's a professional.

1549
02:36:18,199 --> 02:36:20,895
- I'll go back to eating my chicken, then.
- No.

1550
02:36:21,103 --> 02:36:24,129
If the guest of honor is bored,
why doesn't she do it?

1551
02:36:24,340 --> 02:36:26,136
With great pleasure.

1552
02:36:26,341 --> 02:36:28,366
Now we're talking!

1553
02:36:28,611 --> 02:36:32,047
Nadia, if you really do it,
I swear I'll stop smoking!

1554
02:36:32,248 --> 02:36:34,715
Put on "Patricia."
I'll turn off the lights.

1555
02:36:34,917 --> 02:36:37,886
- Come on, put on "Patricia."
- Great, "Patricia" it is.

1556
02:36:38,087 --> 02:36:40,647
An inaugural
and commemorative striptease...

1557
02:36:40,858 --> 02:36:44,725
...performed by our Nadia,
to baptize her new life.

1558
02:36:44,927 --> 02:36:47,418
- One always has to set a good example.
- It's idiotic.

1559
02:36:47,630 --> 02:36:50,565
- That's why I'm doing it.
- Nadia, your mink stole!

1560
02:37:11,490 --> 02:37:15,653
That guy will be at your place with
the money ready in no time. Believe me.

1561
02:37:30,612 --> 02:37:32,204
At least, I don't remember.

1562
02:37:34,717 --> 02:37:37,412
What did the lady say?
I didn't understand.

1563
02:37:37,619 --> 02:37:40,452
She asked you if you like me.

1564
02:37:53,370 --> 02:37:57,430
That's mine, Nadia! You owe it to me.
I want that.

1565
02:37:58,976 --> 02:38:02,639
Really, Marcello, you got
a great deal with this car.

1566
02:38:02,848 --> 02:38:05,975
It's a wonderful car, you'll see.
It's a beautiful thing.

1567
02:38:06,184 --> 02:38:07,776
Give me a hand.

1568
02:38:27,874 --> 02:38:31,310
Isn't that enough? Can't you see
you're not entertaining anyone?

1569
02:38:31,512 --> 02:38:34,709
You starting already?
I'm entertaining myself.

1570
02:38:34,916 --> 02:38:38,214
You don't have the guts
to go all the way. You're scared.

1571
02:38:38,419 --> 02:38:42,879
- Might as well stop now.
- Oh, no? You'll see. You'll see!

1572
02:38:59,676 --> 02:39:02,110
Nadia, you shouldn't have
taken off your bra yet.

1573
02:39:02,313 --> 02:39:05,907
The bra, it's the second to last item.
Am I right?

1574
02:39:08,753 --> 02:39:10,948
Good! Congratulations!

1575
02:39:14,761 --> 02:39:19,493
Don't take off the slip. Cover yourself
with the stole and then pull it off.

1576
02:39:23,602 --> 02:39:25,570
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

1577
02:39:34,682 --> 02:39:38,674
- She's not kidding, then.
- Good girl.

1578
02:39:50,532 --> 02:39:54,298
Ruggero!
Ruggero, are you serious?

1579
02:39:54,503 --> 02:39:57,903
You're not a sport.
You don't deserve a woman like this.

1580
02:40:01,178 --> 02:40:03,476
And now, Nadia, take off the stole!

1581
02:40:04,415 --> 02:40:08,441
Come on, Nadia. This is it.
We want to see.

1582
02:40:10,821 --> 02:40:14,222
How did her husband
let her divorce him?

1583
02:40:14,425 --> 02:40:19,623
- She's remarkable, isn't she?
- She's marvelous. She's really hot.

1584
02:40:22,700 --> 02:40:24,634
Oh, God, Riccardo is here!

1585
02:40:25,504 --> 02:40:27,937
Hey, the host is here.

1586
02:40:30,241 --> 02:40:32,402
- Hey, sons of bitches!
- Hi, Riccardo!

1587
02:40:32,611 --> 02:40:34,738
When someone like Nadia
gets rid of a rich husband...

1588
02:40:34,947 --> 02:40:36,277
...this is the least we can do.

1589
02:40:36,515 --> 02:40:40,349
What do I care about her annulment?
I have enough trouble on my own.

1590
02:40:40,887 --> 02:40:43,378
And I don't want photos,
I don't want publicity.

1591
02:40:43,591 --> 02:40:46,957
But on the phone,
you said we could come. Kiss.

1592
02:40:48,696 --> 02:40:52,757
- Who's the idiot that broke the glass?
- Hi, Riccardo.

1593
02:40:52,967 --> 02:40:55,561
Tomorrow morning at 6:00
I'm leaving for Nice.

1594
02:40:55,772 --> 02:40:59,935
So everybody out in half an hour
or I will kick you out.

1595
02:41:02,611 --> 02:41:04,806
- I met her in Spoleto.
- Did you call that person?

1596
02:41:05,014 --> 02:41:08,346
No, I didn't. Guys, I'm serious,
out in half an hour.

1597
02:41:08,550 --> 02:41:12,350
Who cares if you're leaving?
We're not going anywhere.

1598
02:41:12,556 --> 02:41:15,423
We're all friends,
you can go if you want.

1599
02:41:15,627 --> 02:41:19,585
Intellectual man, why don't you
amuse us. I'll raise your salary.

1600
02:41:19,797 --> 02:41:24,734
Nadia was a good sport, but her
striptease didn't warm up the room.

1601
02:41:25,437 --> 02:41:27,904
Come on, come up with something!

1602
02:41:28,873 --> 02:41:32,309
I have 1000, 2000 ideas.

1603
02:41:32,509 --> 02:41:37,741
I could keep you a week without getting
bored, but you have to do what I say.

1604
02:41:37,948 --> 02:41:41,907
- We'll do anything you want.
- First of all, let's close the curtains.

1605
02:41:42,121 --> 02:41:46,421
Let's stay in here.
Let's keep this nice intimacy.

1606
02:41:46,660 --> 02:41:50,595
So I propose that our American
dancer makes love with someone.

1607
02:41:50,796 --> 02:41:52,627
Oh, yes, that's good!

1608
02:41:52,832 --> 02:41:57,325
I bet you never made love. Did you
ever have a man all to yourself?

1609
02:41:57,637 --> 02:42:02,506
Yes? No?
A man who holds you in his arms?

1610
02:42:05,213 --> 02:42:08,773
- What does he want?
- Nothing, he's drunk.

1611
02:42:08,984 --> 02:42:11,919
- Happy about your exploit?
- What time is it?

1612
02:42:12,322 --> 02:42:17,224
After all, it's a duty of hospitality
towards a foreigner, a tourist duty.

1613
02:42:17,426 --> 02:42:19,417
So I'll choose for you.

1614
02:42:19,629 --> 02:42:23,463
It'll be Tito the Brute who'll give you
the delight of the first screwing!

1615
02:42:23,802 --> 02:42:28,761
We didn't do anything. We're lacking
courage. You take care of the music.

1616
02:42:28,973 --> 02:42:30,201
Tito, take your shirt off.

1617
02:42:30,408 --> 02:42:32,069
- Come on!
- You think he's a man?

1618
02:42:32,277 --> 02:42:36,304
I made a good choice. Now, when I turn
off the light, make a woman out of her.

1619
02:42:36,516 --> 02:42:39,109
At the same time, the Tunisian girl
will approach the lawyer...

1620
02:42:39,316 --> 02:42:42,717
...who's been living on his memories...
- Speak for yourself!

1621
02:42:42,920 --> 02:42:44,854
All known means are accepted.

1622
02:42:45,089 --> 02:42:48,649
We're leaving.
Thank you for the beautiful evening.

1623
02:42:48,959 --> 02:42:52,622
No, nobody's getting out of here,
there's plenty of time till dawn.

1624
02:42:52,832 --> 02:42:56,996
You, half-impotent as a man
and as an artist...

1625
02:42:57,235 --> 02:43:00,033
...when I turn off the light,
be brave, make the leap!

1626
02:43:00,239 --> 02:43:02,434
- All right.
- Tonight...

1627
02:43:03,944 --> 02:43:06,674
...you'll couple with Mariuccio.

1628
02:43:06,948 --> 02:43:09,438
Then, Lisa...

1629
02:43:09,651 --> 02:43:14,350
...who paints only to take
her models to bed...

1630
02:43:14,590 --> 02:43:17,150
...you know what I got for you?

1631
02:43:17,358 --> 02:43:21,192
Now you've really bored us.
What are you trying to do?

1632
02:43:21,398 --> 02:43:23,662
Who are you trying to hurt?
I'll kick your ass out of here!

1633
02:43:24,201 --> 02:43:26,101
Who invited you?
Why are you breaking things?

1634
02:43:26,304 --> 02:43:30,569
Riccardino, you'll have a good time
now. This party must never end.

1635
02:43:30,841 --> 02:43:33,275
We'll all stay here.
Someone could come at anytime.

1636
02:43:33,476 --> 02:43:36,968
That's a great line! New, especially.

1637
02:43:39,016 --> 02:43:41,041
And you...

1638
02:43:42,353 --> 02:43:45,379
You're dying to make love with me...

1639
02:43:45,590 --> 02:43:48,353
...because you can't find anyone
who'd come under your sheets.

1640
02:43:48,559 --> 02:43:53,019
You release your tension by singing
on those lousy records...

1641
02:43:53,231 --> 02:43:55,165
God, Marcello, I pity you.

1642
02:44:02,841 --> 02:44:06,572
No, not even in Neapolitan dramas!
No!

1643
02:44:06,914 --> 02:44:09,643
You're a real pig. I don't allow
this sort of behavior.

1644
02:44:09,849 --> 02:44:11,976
Apologize to the lady!

1645
02:44:12,519 --> 02:44:14,111
Leave him alone.

1646
02:44:14,555 --> 02:44:18,581
I wanted to give a thank-you speech
to all my friends...

1647
02:44:18,793 --> 02:44:23,230
...for the beautiful career they gave me.
- Don't go. Stay with me!

1648
02:44:24,065 --> 02:44:26,898
I wanted to give a speech to thank...

1649
02:44:27,102 --> 02:44:29,592
Why? Who did you want to thank?

1650
02:44:30,872 --> 02:44:36,504
Beautiful, chubby, mountain farm girl!
I'll bet you're from my parts.

1651
02:44:36,880 --> 02:44:39,507
- Come here.
- Where are you from?

1652
02:44:39,716 --> 02:44:44,983
Let's show this bunch of impotents
how strong you are.

1653
02:44:46,557 --> 02:44:49,150
You came to Rome to try your luck,
didn't you?

1654
02:44:49,359 --> 02:44:53,921
But I'm so unlucky.
If you only knew how unlucky I am.

1655
02:44:55,633 --> 02:45:00,695
What's the matter? What is it?
Are you sick? Wake up!

1656
02:45:05,077 --> 02:45:06,476
Get her some water, she's sick.

1657
02:45:06,645 --> 02:45:06,712
I

1658
02:45:06,712 --> 02:45:10,579
Andrea! Start turning off the lights.

1659
02:45:11,250 --> 02:45:14,310
- What about these guarantees?
- I'm not signing anything.

1660
02:45:14,520 --> 02:45:17,614
- I'm working on a movie.
- And you're already broke.

1661
02:45:17,824 --> 02:45:20,018
- It's not true.
- I said I'm not signing anything.

1662
02:45:20,226 --> 02:45:22,524
The case has been postponed
to the 15th.

1663
02:45:27,735 --> 02:45:29,292
What is this music?

1664
02:45:32,841 --> 02:45:35,708
What are you laughing at?
Who turned off the lights?

1665
02:45:36,512 --> 02:45:39,002
- Will you give me a ride?
- No, I'm not going to Rome.

1666
02:45:39,214 --> 02:45:41,614
You, come on, get dressed. Out!

1667
02:45:48,059 --> 02:45:51,516
Darling, don't worry.
This will help you.

1668
02:45:51,729 --> 02:45:54,630
This medicine will make
your headache go away.

1669
02:45:54,832 --> 02:45:57,995
So, what about your first husband?
I haven't seen him in a while.

1670
02:45:58,203 --> 02:46:02,969
To solve the garage problem, I had to
put the pool at the bottom of the stairs.

1671
02:46:03,174 --> 02:46:08,907
This girl is sick. Take her outside to get
some air. Then, thank God I found...

1672
02:46:09,113 --> 02:46:13,482
- Stand up!
- But I'm sick!

1673
02:46:15,588 --> 02:46:20,581
- Let's pretend you're a nice chicken.
- No, I don't feel like it.

1674
02:46:20,793 --> 02:46:23,284
- I bet you're from Fano.
- No, close to Fano.

1675
02:46:23,496 --> 02:46:26,590
What are you doing to that girl?

1676
02:46:26,800 --> 02:46:29,290
I really don't care.

1677
02:46:29,503 --> 02:46:32,495
You really don't care?

1678
02:46:34,042 --> 02:46:36,567
No, really, I don't care.

1679
02:46:36,778 --> 02:46:40,975
- I don't. If you don't write an article...
- Come here. Come here.

1680
02:46:41,182 --> 02:46:44,515
You sure tell a lot of lies
here in Rome.

1681
02:46:44,721 --> 02:46:49,180
I'm not finished with you.
Come here. Raise your head.

1682
02:46:50,627 --> 02:46:52,458
Raise your head!

1683
02:46:59,602 --> 02:47:03,231
- You fool.
- Do you know Commendatore Angelini?

1684
02:47:03,673 --> 02:47:09,542
What are you doing? Will you write it
in the paper that I wanted to strip?

1685
02:47:10,980 --> 02:47:12,709
- Do you want to dance?
- Yes.

1686
02:47:14,252 --> 02:47:16,083
These are really jokes for men.

1687
02:47:16,288 --> 02:47:18,756
- Let's go say hi to the painter.
- He's not there.

1688
02:47:18,958 --> 02:47:22,290
- He went to Riccione with his wife.
- Let's hitchhike.

1689
02:47:22,494 --> 02:47:24,325
No, I want to be alone.

1690
02:47:24,530 --> 02:47:27,522
- I'm really sad tonight.
- Me too.

1691
02:47:28,535 --> 02:47:30,900
- How do I look?
- You look like a hooker.

1692
02:47:38,378 --> 02:47:41,540
- You were very mean to Odette.
- You knew Odette?

1693
02:47:41,748 --> 02:47:43,545
But I left her the apartment.

1694
02:47:43,751 --> 02:47:47,653
- Who is that poor girl?
- My tummy hurts now.

1695
02:47:50,023 --> 02:47:51,251
It's daytime, people!

1696
02:47:52,994 --> 02:47:56,486
- My watch says 2 a.m.
- It must've stopped.

1697
02:47:56,699 --> 02:47:58,132
What time is it?

1698
02:47:58,335 --> 02:48:02,327
- It's 5:15.
- I have to be in court at 9:00.

1699
02:48:02,973 --> 02:48:06,534
- Can you give me a ride into Rome?
- I'm not going to Rome.

1700
02:48:06,742 --> 02:48:11,178
It was a nice party,
but that's enough.

1701
02:48:12,516 --> 02:48:14,984
Enough, enough, enough.

1702
02:48:17,321 --> 02:48:20,016
Where are my shoes?

1703
02:48:22,693 --> 02:48:25,287
Caterina!

1704
02:48:30,335 --> 02:48:34,032
Sondra and Daniela!

1705
02:48:41,079 --> 02:48:43,206
Paul Newman!

1706
02:48:46,686 --> 02:48:51,588
- Have a nice trip, Riccardo.
- Bye. Sorry, but I really couldn't.

1707
02:49:01,803 --> 02:49:05,569
- And now the beautiful Nadia.
- Shall we go?

1708
02:49:08,878 --> 02:49:12,313
- Bye, I'll call you tomorrow.
- No, I'll call you when I get back.

1709
02:49:12,515 --> 02:49:15,507
- Bye, Nadia. Congratulations.
- Thanks, bye.

1710
02:49:15,718 --> 02:49:18,209
- Good luck to both of you!
- Thank you! Thank you!

1711
02:49:19,956 --> 02:49:22,686
And now it's the lawyer's turn!

1712
02:49:22,893 --> 02:49:27,227
- Grand finale with the lawyer!
- Why don't you do a striptease?

1713
02:49:27,432 --> 02:49:29,627
Well done, Mr. Lawyer.

1714
02:50:08,611 --> 02:50:12,046
- What's down there?
- Where?

1715
02:50:32,635 --> 02:50:34,603
Nature.

1716
02:50:34,804 --> 02:50:38,831
Dawn always makes me emotional.
So emotional.

1717
02:50:39,044 --> 02:50:43,537
I looked so good last night
with makeup. Now I feel all sticky.

1718
02:50:43,848 --> 02:50:48,148
But who cares anymore? It's time
for me to retire anyway. I feel that...

1719
02:51:12,946 --> 02:51:15,813
More retire and more come out.

1720
02:51:18,519 --> 02:51:21,282
If two retire, 10 more appear.

1721
02:51:22,191 --> 02:51:25,888
By 1965, it will be total perversion.

1722
02:51:26,328 --> 02:51:28,694
You'll see how disgusting.

1723
02:51:31,032 --> 02:51:33,865
- Back! Stand back!
- Easy. Easy!

1724
02:51:39,577 --> 02:51:42,545
You'll make a fortune with this fish.
It's worth millions.

1725
02:51:43,080 --> 02:51:45,378
Hey, guys, look! It's a monster!

1726
02:51:56,662 --> 02:51:58,892
Oh, my God.

1727
02:52:02,167 --> 02:52:06,467
- But it's alive.
- It's been dead for three days.

1728
02:52:10,043 --> 02:52:13,603
- Is it male or female?
- What's it looking at?

1729
02:52:21,588 --> 02:52:23,783
Why don't we buy it?
Would you sell it?

1730
02:52:28,997 --> 02:52:32,932
- I wonder where it comes from.
- Maybe it comes from Australia.

1731
02:52:33,134 --> 02:52:36,467
- Why Australia?
- Where's the head, where's the tail?

1732
02:52:37,239 --> 02:52:39,070
Poor thing.

1733
02:52:42,912 --> 02:52:44,971
And it insists on looking.

1734
02:53:30,633 --> 02:53:32,930
I don't understand.
I can't hear you!

1735
02:53:45,714 --> 02:53:47,705
I don't understand,

1736
02:53:54,357 --> 02:53:56,757
I can't hear!

1737
02:54:06,804 --> 02:54:09,068
- Let's go!
- I'm coming.
