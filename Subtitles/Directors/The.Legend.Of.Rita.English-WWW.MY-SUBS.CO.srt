00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Invest in www.caseway.ai 
to change the legal industry!

2
00:00:31,298 --> 00:00:32,600
Hi, everybody!

3
00:00:32,601 --> 00:00:34,135
We are robbers!

4
00:00:34,136 --> 00:00:35,422
Come on! Put your arms up!

5
00:00:35,423 --> 00:00:37,223
You've seen us in the newspapers!

6
00:00:40,536 --> 00:00:41,560
Don't do anything stupid!

7
00:00:41,561 --> 00:00:44,437
This is our way to help the economy.

8
00:00:44,438 --> 00:00:46,345
This is an expropriation
proceeding.

9
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:47,799
Pack everything up!

10
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,383
Possession is a crime!

11
00:00:50,142 --> 00:00:51,219
Take what you need.

12
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:52,519
After that, put your hands up!

13
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,304
We are bringing down capitalism!

14
00:00:54,305 --> 00:00:55,305
Pack it in!

15
00:00:58,585 --> 00:01:00,265
Faster!

16
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:06,166
Come on, Granny!
There's a robbery in progress.

17
00:01:06,745 --> 00:01:07,905
Ah?

18
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:34,092
Spare a buck, young lady?

19
00:01:44,303 --> 00:01:46,543
You should live forever!
Good luck!

20
00:01:47,792 --> 00:01:49,176
Those were the happy years.

21
00:01:49,977 --> 00:01:52,112
We thought we were
the best, Tatjana.

22
00:01:52,826 --> 00:01:54,915
Somehow,
we tried to abolish injustice,

23
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:56,583
and then the government.

24
00:01:57,094 --> 00:01:58,218
or the other way round.

25
00:01:58,555 --> 00:01:59,786
Both were connected.

26
00:02:00,507 --> 00:02:03,307
Politics were at war,
all around the world.

27
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:11,298
She has a .765 Walther.

28
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:14,034
How do you know that?

29
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:18,307
It's hidden.

30
00:02:51,286 --> 00:02:52,606
Please open the bag.

31
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:55,543
I'm travelling in transit.

32
00:02:55,544 --> 00:02:56,555
Please, open the bag.

33
00:03:09,182 --> 00:03:10,334
Take a seat, please.

34
00:03:20,518 --> 00:03:21,902
Your name is Marianna Berg.

35
00:03:22,282 --> 00:03:23,284
Yes.

36
00:03:25,054 --> 00:03:26,963
But you are Rita Vogt.

37
00:03:26,964 --> 00:03:28,689
As you can see, I am Marianna Berg.

38
00:03:31,684 --> 00:03:33,667
As far as I know
you are Rita Vogt.

39
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:40,988
You are not allowed
to come in with a weapon.

40
00:03:41,423 --> 00:03:43,423
I'm only passing by to West Berlin.

41
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,029
You are not allowed
to pass by with a weapon either.

42
00:03:49,584 --> 00:03:52,505
My friends in Beirut
recommended Schönefeld.

43
00:03:58,211 --> 00:04:00,611
Sometimes you have friends in common.

44
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:12,986
In case you ever come back here,

45
00:04:14,701 --> 00:04:16,056
take this phone number.

46
00:04:16,642 --> 00:04:18,158
I can pass through then?

47
00:04:19,026 --> 00:04:20,160
When I am informed.

48
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:22,296
Can I take my friends?

49
00:04:24,105 --> 00:04:25,432
I just need to be informed in advance.

50
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:41,284
My name is Erwin.

51
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:46,486
THE LEGEND OF RITA

52
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,232
It's so generous
that you want to help us.

53
00:06:04,233 --> 00:06:07,889
I would love to ride horses,
play tennis or guzzle down salmon.

54
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:10,940
Here is your passport.

55
00:06:15,103 --> 00:06:16,877
One has to hate
the world's crudeness

56
00:06:17,592 --> 00:06:19,446
in order to appreciate it.

57
00:06:19,726 --> 00:06:21,674
It was different for me,
cause I was in love.

58
00:06:21,675 --> 00:06:22,698
With Andy?

59
00:06:26,171 --> 00:06:27,516
Do you know how to use it?

60
00:06:29,072 --> 00:06:30,712
She can hit trees,
but only wide ones.

61
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,721
Gruber defends him.

62
00:06:34,722 --> 00:06:36,319
Isn't it the best solution?

63
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:39,480
No way.
He'd be in prison for 10 more years.

64
00:06:45,747 --> 00:06:47,707
Gruber won't be
involved in anything.

65
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:15,435
Someone is here to see Mr. Klein.

66
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,160
This is my trainee,
Mrs. Adebach.

67
00:07:29,712 --> 00:07:33,253
A police officer shoots
someone who's fleeing.

68
00:07:33,771 --> 00:07:36,290
Does he want to kill him,
or just thwart the getaway?

69
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,325
A guy who flees shoots...

70
00:07:38,721 --> 00:07:40,861
the police officer who follows him...

71
00:07:41,436 --> 00:07:44,464
Does he want to kill him
or just continue his getaway?

72
00:07:45,112 --> 00:07:46,897
That could be possible.
What do you think?

73
00:07:46,898 --> 00:07:48,968
It's also a question of effort.

74
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,798
I'm glad that you are willing to try.

75
00:07:59,401 --> 00:08:00,450
- Hello.
- Hello.

76
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,315
I'd like to ask something.

77
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,819
Please, go ahead.

78
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,221
Last Christmas,
an amnesty was granted.

79
00:08:07,852 --> 00:08:11,012
My brother got out then.
Now he's in again.

80
00:08:12,016 --> 00:08:14,561
Will there be another
amnesty this Christmas?

81
00:08:15,314 --> 00:08:18,832
I don't want to be rude,
but I don't think so.

82
00:08:19,903 --> 00:08:22,122
Yes, but it's Christmas.

83
00:08:24,035 --> 00:08:25,195
Andreas Klein.

84
00:08:28,566 --> 00:08:31,214
My name is Gruber.
This is Ms. Adebach.

85
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:34,870
We've got one hour.

86
00:08:48,473 --> 00:08:50,358
Are you insane?

87
00:08:58,202 --> 00:08:59,381
Open the door, please.

88
00:09:06,443 --> 00:09:07,683
Venceremos!

89
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:28,069
Where is she?
Where's Fredericke?

90
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,704
She didn't make it.

91
00:09:30,085 --> 00:09:31,214
Move!

92
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,480
This coat is so freaking
light-coloured!

93
00:09:51,481 --> 00:09:52,760
Why did you shoot?

94
00:09:52,761 --> 00:09:54,662
You didn't have to!

95
00:09:54,663 --> 00:09:56,095
What happened?

96
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:57,894
Give me your jacket,
this won't work!

97
00:09:57,895 --> 00:09:59,602
Why did you shoot?

98
00:09:59,603 --> 00:10:01,689
Stop yelling!
Nothing went wrong!

99
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,986
Where are we going?

100
00:10:04,987 --> 00:10:06,107
Across the border.

101
00:10:06,108 --> 00:10:07,255
Are you crazy?

102
00:10:16,127 --> 00:10:19,319
Berlin, capital of the GDR.

103
00:10:19,842 --> 00:10:21,855
Train station Friedrichstraße.

104
00:10:23,421 --> 00:10:26,894
Passengers from West Germany
Go to counters 1 - 5.

105
00:10:28,249 --> 00:10:32,466
Passengers from GDR, go to counter 7.

106
00:10:41,334 --> 00:10:43,129
Red cops are cops, too.

107
00:10:46,121 --> 00:10:48,849
It's not possible that
only Erwin is travelling.

108
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,284
That's probably not
even his real name.

109
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,198
In Germany,

110
00:11:05,511 --> 00:11:07,434
aggression has always come
from the right wing.

111
00:11:08,207 --> 00:11:10,530
But we are also against
terrorism from the left.

112
00:11:13,384 --> 00:11:14,975
It doesn't lead anywhere.

113
00:11:15,764 --> 00:11:16,845
It scares the public,

114
00:11:16,846 --> 00:11:18,513
and causes problems
in the administration.

115
00:11:18,514 --> 00:11:21,114
Even Lenin,
his brother was a terrorist.

116
00:11:21,813 --> 00:11:22,973
He was executed.

117
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:26,019
Sit down!

118
00:11:26,529 --> 00:11:27,534
Thank you.

119
00:11:30,591 --> 00:11:33,293
On the other hand, I sympathise

120
00:11:33,994 --> 00:11:36,309
with young, romantic people.

121
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:38,120
We are also romantics.

122
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:42,979
I'm 70.

123
00:11:45,044 --> 00:11:46,644
And I'm still dreaming.

124
00:11:47,697 --> 00:11:49,177
Nothing's ever completed.

125
00:11:50,631 --> 00:11:52,546
How, in plain daylight,

126
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:55,249
can they break a guy out of prison?

127
00:11:56,285 --> 00:11:58,111
Up to now,
we've never known their plans.

128
00:11:58,112 --> 00:11:59,627
But we're supposed
to know everything!

129
00:11:59,628 --> 00:12:01,996
Wherever possible.
You have to look at it that way.

130
00:12:01,997 --> 00:12:03,543
It's exactly my point
of view, General.

131
00:12:03,544 --> 00:12:05,591
What are you up to?

132
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:07,729
Trust has to be established through
common experiences.

133
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:08,763
Correct.

134
00:12:08,764 --> 00:12:10,998
I thought we would
barbecue sausages.

135
00:12:15,415 --> 00:12:16,737
I believe the plane is gone.

136
00:12:16,738 --> 00:12:18,396
Maybe it's a trap?

137
00:12:18,397 --> 00:12:19,975
He gave a good impression.

138
00:12:26,702 --> 00:12:28,594
EXIT

139
00:12:33,338 --> 00:12:34,338
Here I am.

140
00:12:36,694 --> 00:12:37,759
So, we meet again so soon.

141
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,534
I didn't see that coming, either.

142
00:12:40,194 --> 00:12:41,526
Your weapon, please.

143
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:42,864
But we're just passing through!

144
00:12:42,865 --> 00:12:44,164
That's what I thought, too.

145
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:46,560
You still have to see a doctor.

146
00:12:54,888 --> 00:12:56,543
I don't have a weapon.

147
00:13:28,572 --> 00:13:29,667
He looked at me.

148
00:13:33,695 --> 00:13:35,249
He understood what was going on.

149
00:13:35,675 --> 00:13:37,525
Maybe he isn't injured so badly.

150
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,257
- Can I help you?
- You are our guests.

151
00:13:46,031 --> 00:13:48,311
- Does anyone want something to eat?
- I do.

152
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,984
This sausage tastes good.

153
00:13:51,985 --> 00:13:53,507
Cause it's Thüringer sausage.

154
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:58,105
- The beer is Radeberger.
- It's tasty as well.

155
00:14:09,071 --> 00:14:11,285
A toast to my release from
the capitalist prison.

156
00:14:11,691 --> 00:14:13,120
As a free man in a free country.

157
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:15,289
Cheers!

158
00:14:15,835 --> 00:14:16,880
Cheers!

159
00:14:20,161 --> 00:14:21,161
Okay. This place is cosy.

160
00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:23,597
But what are we doing here?

161
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:26,774
Exchange of thoughts.

162
00:14:26,775 --> 00:14:28,535
Which thoughts would
you like to exchange?

163
00:14:29,754 --> 00:14:33,796
For example, that the revolution
moves in different directions.

164
00:14:33,797 --> 00:14:36,178
Mainly in the office?
From 8:00 to 17:00?

165
00:14:39,608 --> 00:14:41,281
You guys have such
a sense for violence.

166
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:45,052
At our place, the government
is the organized form of violence.

167
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:48,388
You can only break law,
but we create it!

168
00:14:48,989 --> 00:14:50,724
From the outside,
you only see the wall.

169
00:14:51,211 --> 00:14:52,451
Sandwich or bread?

170
00:14:53,717 --> 00:14:55,334
You see the wall from the inside, too.

171
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,932
Does the GDR have to
extradite criminals

172
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:01,736
who are wanted in West Germany?

173
00:15:01,737 --> 00:15:03,501
I'm not responsible for this.

174
00:15:05,107 --> 00:15:07,508
But both parts are not really friends.

175
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:11,979
We just want nothing
bad to happen here.

176
00:15:13,362 --> 00:15:15,569
No actions on GDR territory!

177
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:17,251
Nobody wants that.

178
00:15:18,211 --> 00:15:19,354
Therefore, you could pass through.

179
00:15:19,355 --> 00:15:22,055
We fight independently
against imperialism.

180
00:15:23,087 --> 00:15:24,892
But we have a common enemy,
as you pointed out.

181
00:15:25,395 --> 00:15:26,894
Sometimes it's difficult to define.

182
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:29,605
We frighten the right people.

183
00:15:30,974 --> 00:15:33,500
The counsellor died on the scene.

184
00:15:34,306 --> 00:15:38,238
Lawyer Dr. Gruber haven't worked on
cases concerning terrorism before.

185
00:15:38,766 --> 00:15:41,208
He leaves a wife
and two little kids.

186
00:15:41,852 --> 00:15:44,518
His employee, Fredericke Adebach

187
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:47,714
helped Andreas Klein to
get a weapon through.

188
00:15:48,542 --> 00:15:52,579
A large-scale manhunt
has been initiated.

189
00:15:52,859 --> 00:15:54,556
Apart from Andreas Klein,

190
00:15:54,557 --> 00:15:56,590
the following people are wanted:

191
00:15:57,474 --> 00:15:59,760
Detlev Bergmann, Joachim Klatte,

192
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:03,172
Hans Jürgen Dost,
Martina Lubitz,

193
00:16:03,477 --> 00:16:05,199
Rita Vogt.

194
00:16:05,774 --> 00:16:08,917
Rita Vogt has a visible
scar on her elbow.

195
00:16:09,369 --> 00:16:12,639
Caution:
These people are armed.

196
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:16,510
The police is sure that they
are still in West Berlin.

197
00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:19,178
However, the search
has been expanded

198
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:21,215
to cover the entire
federal territory.

199
00:16:21,851 --> 00:16:23,283
Did you really have to shoot?

200
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:25,786
He was holding me.

201
00:16:26,797 --> 00:16:28,244
Why did he do that?

202
00:16:43,004 --> 00:16:44,872
I can't hit a human being.

203
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:48,310
Then the cop came and shot.
So did I.

204
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:50,709
He was in the way.

205
00:16:52,634 --> 00:16:54,345
Should we separate
for a while, Andi?

206
00:16:57,358 --> 00:16:59,204
Will imperialism go down by itself?

207
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,079
And the history develops itself?

208
00:17:03,315 --> 00:17:04,809
The injustice vanishes by itself?

209
00:17:05,783 --> 00:17:07,194
I don't want to argue with you,

210
00:17:08,161 --> 00:17:09,602
I simply want to be with you!

211
00:17:24,768 --> 00:17:25,774
Well...

212
00:17:34,191 --> 00:17:35,907
Excuse me, comrades.

213
00:17:53,577 --> 00:17:54,675
I'm cracking up,

214
00:17:55,843 --> 00:17:57,211
they are having sex.

215
00:17:57,694 --> 00:17:59,000
Here, in the East.

216
00:18:01,907 --> 00:18:03,202
What are we doing?

217
00:18:03,203 --> 00:18:04,727
We are not having sex.

218
00:18:05,772 --> 00:18:07,387
Both are nice girls.

219
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:10,090
Plus, they have
stable employment.

220
00:18:11,111 --> 00:18:12,860
You won't find anything like them.

221
00:18:13,547 --> 00:18:15,828
I think that they are demotivated.

222
00:18:20,601 --> 00:18:22,536
We tried to
accomplish the impossible,

223
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,206
at least once in our lives.

224
00:18:26,463 --> 00:18:29,543
We felt like we were part
of the international fight.

225
00:18:30,249 --> 00:18:33,047
And then we experienced
how in Beirut,

226
00:18:33,048 --> 00:18:35,916
a right cause led to
a murderous civil war.

227
00:18:36,932 --> 00:18:39,486
We wanted to bring the war
into the capitals of the world.

228
00:18:41,107 --> 00:18:42,957
There was never ending discussion,

229
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:44,625
successful and failed actions.

230
00:18:45,263 --> 00:18:46,759
Victims on both sides.

231
00:18:48,417 --> 00:18:50,665
A couple of years later,
we were in Paris.

232
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:52,332
And we were in jail.

233
00:18:53,295 --> 00:18:56,370
I know how it will end in jail.

234
00:18:59,124 --> 00:19:02,660
We just sit in these countries
wasting our lives...

235
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,145
...and for what?

236
00:19:05,576 --> 00:19:07,234
The poor people around the world?

237
00:19:09,049 --> 00:19:10,672
Let's go there!

238
00:19:10,673 --> 00:19:11,773
To those who starve.

239
00:19:11,774 --> 00:19:13,356
Because the culprits live here.

240
00:19:14,838 --> 00:19:17,090
Right, the system is run by people.

241
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:21,395
We just say everything
within our limits.

242
00:19:22,323 --> 00:19:23,992
Those are Andi's texts,

243
00:19:23,993 --> 00:19:25,666
Andi has started everything.

244
00:19:25,667 --> 00:19:27,468
He has started everything by himself.

245
00:19:28,211 --> 00:19:30,767
You don't want to ride or play tennis
and that can't be.

246
00:19:30,768 --> 00:19:32,455
And so on, and so on...

247
00:19:46,154 --> 00:19:48,642
If they trap me,
I don't know how to deal with that.

248
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,202
Do you see those guys there?

249
00:20:06,203 --> 00:20:07,875
They will kill us.

250
00:20:08,178 --> 00:20:11,738
You are going crazy,
we'll shoot them first.

251
00:20:11,739 --> 00:20:13,738
There are no doubts.

252
00:20:13,739 --> 00:20:16,718
Imperialism is an illegal war

253
00:20:16,719 --> 00:20:20,255
the only way to force that....

254
00:20:20,256 --> 00:20:22,390
Yes, that's the problem,
human or pigs.

255
00:20:22,391 --> 00:20:24,357
We need money for our next steps.

256
00:20:24,358 --> 00:20:26,077
The solution is the guns.

257
00:20:27,222 --> 00:20:31,164
Theoretically, we can put two barrels
of beer in front of the door.

258
00:20:32,417 --> 00:20:34,468
We did it a lot of times,
then we can go out.

259
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:37,136
He considered it.

260
00:20:37,137 --> 00:20:39,406
I think it's ridiculous
to build a wall.

261
00:20:39,831 --> 00:20:41,208
Can you please explain?

262
00:20:41,641 --> 00:20:44,862
Yes, before we went to people
and said, this is a robbery.

263
00:20:44,863 --> 00:20:46,797
An anticapitalist action.

264
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:48,383
How do you want to do it?
In which language?

265
00:20:48,384 --> 00:20:50,794
- Frederike speaks French.
- And what should she say?

266
00:20:51,053 --> 00:20:52,952
Hello, French friend,
we want your money,

267
00:20:52,953 --> 00:20:54,655
here starts
the German revolution?

268
00:20:55,061 --> 00:20:56,823
You can't go with a gun
to the people...

269
00:20:56,824 --> 00:20:59,681
Just be practical, show your gun,
hand to the air, no panic.

270
00:20:59,682 --> 00:21:02,387
I want that everyone goes inside,
like we always did.

271
00:21:02,388 --> 00:21:05,132
- I don't want to!
- You have a problem!

272
00:21:05,611 --> 00:21:08,745
But if you go with our money,
and you spend it in a Honda...

273
00:21:08,746 --> 00:21:11,280
and you go around Paris,
then you will give us in.

274
00:21:11,281 --> 00:21:13,627
Then you go to the pigs,
and you'll betray me.

275
00:21:13,628 --> 00:21:15,215
- Is that what you think?
- Yes

276
00:21:15,216 --> 00:21:17,712
You are looking for a fight,
why are you choosing me?

277
00:21:18,934 --> 00:21:20,414
Leave Rita alone.

278
00:21:20,857 --> 00:21:22,450
You live your life
and use expensive brands.

279
00:21:22,451 --> 00:21:25,286
And you are an idiot!

280
00:21:25,287 --> 00:21:27,756
Hey! Calm down!
Don't take it personal.

281
00:21:28,555 --> 00:21:29,924
What's happening to that pig?!

282
00:21:29,925 --> 00:21:31,524
What are you?
Problem or solution?

283
00:21:31,525 --> 00:21:32,926
Person or a pig?

284
00:21:33,274 --> 00:21:34,494
This should be clear.

285
00:21:35,045 --> 00:21:37,431
Fight against the pigs,
so we can free people.

286
00:21:38,305 --> 00:21:41,725
Each shooting breaks
the connections

287
00:21:41,726 --> 00:21:43,137
and brings results.

288
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,305
It's crystal clear, isn't it?

289
00:22:20,484 --> 00:22:22,283
Why are you without helmets, ladies?

290
00:22:22,284 --> 00:22:23,344
We forgot our helmets.

291
00:22:23,345 --> 00:22:24,946
It's required by law.

292
00:22:24,947 --> 00:22:26,614
Please, forgive us, sir.

293
00:22:26,615 --> 00:22:29,075
Oh, you are not from here.
Show me your documents, please.

294
00:24:36,143 --> 00:24:37,378
Early in the morning,

295
00:24:37,379 --> 00:24:38,685
it's cold in the East.

296
00:24:41,741 --> 00:24:43,083
There is everything.

297
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:45,519
Even Radeberger.

298
00:24:46,253 --> 00:24:48,388
With pleasure. That's what
we used to have back then.

299
00:24:49,581 --> 00:24:51,758
If it's already good,
I don't have to change it.

300
00:24:53,883 --> 00:24:55,696
Some comrades don't
want to carry on.

301
00:24:56,049 --> 00:24:57,726
We haven't finished yet.

302
00:24:57,727 --> 00:24:59,071
Not with the emperor.

303
00:25:00,127 --> 00:25:01,681
As for now, we are in a deep trouble.

304
00:25:01,682 --> 00:25:05,126
Those comrades cost us money
and are unreliable.

305
00:25:05,127 --> 00:25:06,739
Wait a second, I am reliable,

306
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,760
but I don't want
to sit around anymore.

307
00:25:08,761 --> 00:25:12,079
We were to fight around the world.
That's what you said.

308
00:25:12,601 --> 00:25:14,025
And, where is it?

309
00:25:15,567 --> 00:25:19,257
Somewhere in this world,
people like us have to be in demand!

310
00:25:23,666 --> 00:25:24,726
Vase.

311
00:25:24,727 --> 00:25:26,393
Angola would be a destination.

312
00:25:27,181 --> 00:25:29,697
Or Mozambique,
if that's possible.

313
00:25:29,698 --> 00:25:31,808
You have connections there,
don't you?

314
00:25:38,898 --> 00:25:40,774
Now it looks much friendlier.

315
00:25:41,847 --> 00:25:43,573
We have to get out of France, too.

316
00:25:45,242 --> 00:25:46,252
I know.

317
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:50,226
To whom did that happen,
with the cop?

318
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:53,808
To me.

319
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,629
It happened to me.

320
00:25:58,755 --> 00:26:00,562
Do you want to quit, too?

321
00:26:00,563 --> 00:26:01,575
No!

322
00:26:06,363 --> 00:26:07,919
There are ten people.

323
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,670
They want to go anywhere.

324
00:26:10,167 --> 00:26:13,540
Preferably Angola
or Mozambique.

325
00:26:14,075 --> 00:26:15,609
So what do they want here?

326
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,578
We are supposed to get them in

327
00:26:17,887 --> 00:26:20,566
and have them accommodated.

328
00:26:20,567 --> 00:26:22,483
People are black there.
They are white.

329
00:26:23,602 --> 00:26:25,933
How do they plan to disappear?

330
00:26:27,341 --> 00:26:28,678
I'll leave that to you.

331
00:26:41,146 --> 00:26:42,780
Let's get back to the topic.

332
00:26:43,851 --> 00:26:45,639
No mistakes are allowed.

333
00:26:46,169 --> 00:26:47,841
That's how I see it, comrade general.

334
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:50,132
That's how one has to see it.

335
00:27:21,763 --> 00:27:25,613
- Do we talk without any witnesses?
- And off the record.

336
00:27:25,614 --> 00:27:27,706
- Where can we sit down and talk?
- Inside.

337
00:27:29,716 --> 00:27:31,053
Maybe under a tree.

338
00:27:35,517 --> 00:27:36,586
Good idea.

339
00:27:44,137 --> 00:27:47,311
Let's assume that you
are wanted worldwide,

340
00:27:47,312 --> 00:27:49,118
even the ones who want to quit.

341
00:27:50,938 --> 00:27:52,773
We won't send any of you...

342
00:27:54,541 --> 00:27:56,343
to Africa,

343
00:27:56,437 --> 00:27:58,879
nor Angola, nor Mozambique.

344
00:27:59,645 --> 00:28:01,624
The political situation is fragile.

345
00:28:01,625 --> 00:28:04,384
Secret agents are
all over the place.

346
00:28:05,452 --> 00:28:07,387
And the people are black.

347
00:28:08,522 --> 00:28:09,556
You are white.

348
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:13,160
You can be traced back to us.

349
00:28:14,261 --> 00:28:16,096
We propose a different offer.

350
00:28:16,802 --> 00:28:18,132
Your people can stay here.

351
00:28:20,227 --> 00:28:21,251
In the GDR.

352
00:28:23,534 --> 00:28:24,818
Separated, not as a group.

353
00:28:24,819 --> 00:28:27,609
No contacts are allowed,

354
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:29,844
neither connections
to your previous life.

355
00:28:29,845 --> 00:28:31,745
Everybody has to agree,
so we can start.

356
00:28:32,366 --> 00:28:33,614
You will have...

357
00:28:34,114 --> 00:28:35,215
new names,

358
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:38,285
and you would be different people.

359
00:28:38,793 --> 00:28:39,987
For a long time.

360
00:28:40,721 --> 00:28:41,977
Maybe forever.

361
00:28:43,109 --> 00:28:45,259
Given that you lead an utterly

362
00:28:45,748 --> 00:28:49,029
normal, ordinary life.

363
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:53,567
The life of the working class.

364
00:29:01,738 --> 00:29:02,979
And one more thing:

365
00:29:05,525 --> 00:29:09,183
We should have regular
meetings and talks.

366
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:15,756
You don't have to inform
us about your plans.

367
00:29:15,757 --> 00:29:17,750
We just want you
to listen to us.

368
00:29:17,751 --> 00:29:19,256
Before you plan anything.

369
00:29:20,896 --> 00:29:22,429
Is it possible to get any
military support?

370
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:25,098
You can do sports here.

371
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:27,135
Is shooting considered as a sport?

372
00:29:28,571 --> 00:29:29,935
We can define it like that.

373
00:29:29,936 --> 00:29:32,772
The RPG-7
is an anti-armour weapon.

374
00:29:32,773 --> 00:29:33,773
Who shoots?

375
00:29:35,801 --> 00:29:36,895
I do.

376
00:29:41,014 --> 00:29:42,586
20 meters safety clearance!

377
00:29:43,614 --> 00:29:46,253
They know the drill.
They have already practised.

378
00:29:52,061 --> 00:29:53,959
They couldn't train this dog
to be a fighter.

379
00:29:54,991 --> 00:29:56,453
What's going on here?

380
00:29:56,454 --> 00:29:58,932
It's required by personal security.
We have to obey.

381
00:29:59,723 --> 00:30:02,230
We also have important
people driving in cars.

382
00:30:02,231 --> 00:30:04,304
Is the dog supposed
to be in the car?

383
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:07,987
Every round has to be accounted for.
The personal security pays for it.

384
00:30:07,988 --> 00:30:09,635
It's a different department.

385
00:30:52,549 --> 00:30:54,268
These songs were ours.

386
00:30:55,422 --> 00:30:57,491
That's how we started
over after the war.

387
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,819
They were always with us.

388
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:01,956
And rock 'n' roll?

389
00:31:03,292 --> 00:31:04,752
Much less.

390
00:31:06,208 --> 00:31:08,426
Vodka is the soldier's friend.

391
00:31:15,466 --> 00:31:16,622
Hey, Andi...

392
00:31:18,155 --> 00:31:19,748
You used to be my
big love once.

393
00:31:20,891 --> 00:31:22,568
I don't understand this now.

394
00:31:40,204 --> 00:31:41,402
Is this here

395
00:31:41,928 --> 00:31:44,104
the life of the working class?

396
00:31:46,167 --> 00:31:48,263
I'd rather drink my beer
somewhere else.

397
00:31:55,816 --> 00:31:56,893
Good morning!

398
00:31:59,608 --> 00:32:00,674
Four to Beirut.

399
00:32:02,361 --> 00:32:03,490
For you,

400
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:07,749
and for you,

401
00:32:09,282 --> 00:32:11,098
and for you.
And you.

402
00:32:11,647 --> 00:32:13,670
You don't have to pay!

403
00:32:14,865 --> 00:32:16,187
We insist to.

404
00:32:17,579 --> 00:32:19,181
There is one spare ticket.

405
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:24,395
Rita!

406
00:32:38,214 --> 00:32:40,190
It's brave of you
to have stayed here.

407
00:32:41,959 --> 00:32:44,365
You are going to see
socialism for what it is.

408
00:32:46,667 --> 00:32:49,136
You are going to see that sometimes
we have to force people to be happy.

409
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:52,606
Probably you have
understood it already.

410
00:32:54,092 --> 00:32:57,211
We are here for people.
And therefore, we are against them.

411
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:03,083
And my mother didn't
get along with herself.

412
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:06,854
She didn't have a lot of money.

413
00:33:09,016 --> 00:33:11,674
At an age of 42, she suddenly died.
I can't wrap my head around it.

414
00:33:18,966 --> 00:33:22,443
- We will start with your story.
- What's my story?

415
00:33:25,906 --> 00:33:28,356
Your made-up life,
which now becomes your real one.

416
00:33:31,639 --> 00:33:33,348
When do you want your birthday to be?

417
00:33:36,088 --> 00:33:38,419
During summertime,
when it's warm.

418
00:33:40,207 --> 00:33:41,539
Which name do you want to have?

419
00:33:45,171 --> 00:33:46,226
For example,

420
00:33:47,288 --> 00:33:48,314
Schmidt?

421
00:33:48,315 --> 00:33:49,830
Schmidt is silly.

422
00:33:50,289 --> 00:33:51,810
Do you have other ideas?

423
00:33:51,811 --> 00:33:53,733
No, Schmidt is okay.

424
00:33:54,926 --> 00:33:55,944
And a name?

425
00:33:57,198 --> 00:33:58,999
You can create it.

426
00:34:00,604 --> 00:34:02,651
We'll make suggestions
for your parents' data.

427
00:34:02,652 --> 00:34:04,401
I don't need parents.

428
00:34:04,402 --> 00:34:05,680
We let them be dead then.

429
00:34:05,681 --> 00:34:08,616
You don't have them anymore anyway.

430
00:34:08,617 --> 00:34:10,351
Otherwise, you'll be asked
about them all the time.

431
00:34:10,352 --> 00:34:12,386
The best lie is the truth.

432
00:35:11,845 --> 00:35:16,044
You know you need to carry
your ID at all times.

433
00:35:16,045 --> 00:35:18,572
I just have another jacket on,
but you know me.

434
00:35:18,573 --> 00:35:21,144
It's not my job
to know everybody.

435
00:35:21,145 --> 00:35:22,823
I'm in fashion
print department.

436
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:28,529
- Name?
- Susanne Schmidt.

437
00:36:06,144 --> 00:36:10,104
Ouch, damn! Damn! Damn!

438
00:36:10,105 --> 00:36:12,539
Something like this never happened
before you started here.

439
00:36:13,775 --> 00:36:15,176
Everybody makes mistakes.

440
00:36:15,177 --> 00:36:17,777
No wonder that
your hands are shaking!

441
00:36:17,778 --> 00:36:18,913
We'll teach you!

442
00:36:18,914 --> 00:36:21,115
Teach Elfriede,
so she takes a shower.

443
00:36:21,785 --> 00:36:24,241
She even has a theory of why
she doesn't take a shower.

444
00:36:24,242 --> 00:36:25,618
I don't use soap.

445
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:28,503
Soap destroys the natural
protective layer of the skin.

446
00:36:28,504 --> 00:36:30,118
We can smell that.

447
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:32,092
I don't care what an alcoholic
has to say about me, anyway.

448
00:36:32,978 --> 00:36:35,364
It's always a fight
with you guys!

449
00:36:35,365 --> 00:36:37,893
Why are you so mean
with Tatjana?

450
00:36:37,894 --> 00:36:39,599
She's the mean one!

451
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,736
And you are cows, stupid cows!

452
00:36:43,955 --> 00:36:45,038
Ready?

453
00:36:45,749 --> 00:36:47,117
I love you all!

454
00:36:52,746 --> 00:36:54,248
Have you never been married?

455
00:36:54,839 --> 00:36:56,083
Unfortunately, no.

456
00:36:56,684 --> 00:36:58,752
There was someone,
when my parents had the accident.

457
00:36:59,764 --> 00:37:01,555
As you know,
they had a fatal accident.

458
00:37:02,789 --> 00:37:04,057
I didn't know that.

459
00:37:04,897 --> 00:37:06,560
Don't you regret coming here?

460
00:37:07,314 --> 00:37:09,430
I've always been left politically.

461
00:37:09,431 --> 00:37:12,666
I didn't have a lot of options.
I used to be a waitress.

462
00:37:14,229 --> 00:37:15,434
Funny.

463
00:37:15,435 --> 00:37:18,735
You come here voluntarily,
the only thing I want is to get away.

464
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:21,275
That's the way it is.
Here and there.

465
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:24,578
I'd like to see that myself.

466
00:37:25,458 --> 00:37:26,914
Maybe I would come back.

467
00:37:27,581 --> 00:37:29,283
Then I'd be here on my own will.

468
00:37:30,553 --> 00:37:31,952
Here's the list...

469
00:37:33,053 --> 00:37:34,122
for Nicaragua.

470
00:37:34,123 --> 00:37:36,156
Again already?

471
00:37:40,027 --> 00:37:41,275
Do you have a pen?

472
00:37:52,015 --> 00:37:53,474
Are you messing with us?

473
00:38:27,801 --> 00:38:28,818
Thank you!

474
00:38:29,883 --> 00:38:31,445
What's going on today?

475
00:38:32,887 --> 00:38:35,382
- You don't dance?
- Neither do you.

476
00:38:37,017 --> 00:38:38,366
Red wine, please.

477
00:38:46,839 --> 00:38:49,663
What I don't get is why
you donate 10 Marks?

478
00:38:50,831 --> 00:38:53,133
I didn't think about it that much.

479
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,413
Do you really think
they get the money?

480
00:38:56,414 --> 00:38:57,522
Don't you think so?

481
00:39:06,647 --> 00:39:07,839
Dear colleagues!

482
00:39:10,644 --> 00:39:12,118
Do you still have
access to West Marks?

483
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:13,254
No.

484
00:39:13,255 --> 00:39:16,191
I spent it on a Trabant.

485
00:39:16,192 --> 00:39:17,657
You can buy everything
with West Marks.

486
00:39:17,658 --> 00:39:19,626
I didn't have much.

487
00:39:21,562 --> 00:39:23,045
Why didn't you rob a bank?

488
00:39:24,965 --> 00:39:28,368
- Oh, I did.
- Cheers to that.

489
00:39:37,882 --> 00:39:39,650
Günnel, Sigrid.

490
00:39:42,382 --> 00:39:44,204
Janzen, Andrea.

491
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,536
And Blechschmidt, Klaus.

492
00:40:06,773 --> 00:40:08,764
''Life is Life... ''

493
00:41:27,123 --> 00:41:28,311
Tatjana!

494
00:41:34,699 --> 00:41:35,746
Tatjana!

495
00:41:57,618 --> 00:41:59,103
Tatjana!

496
00:42:01,788 --> 00:42:04,427
- Where were you today?
- I overslept.

497
00:42:05,778 --> 00:42:07,229
We were worried.

498
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,746
I doubt that.

499
00:42:13,634 --> 00:42:16,403
- What's the time?
- Half past three.

500
00:42:18,822 --> 00:42:19,827
Damn.

501
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:28,382
Do you want some coffee?
If you have some, too.

502
00:42:38,727 --> 00:42:40,440
I can do that.

503
00:42:40,441 --> 00:42:41,870
I don't feel well.

504
00:42:47,615 --> 00:42:49,122
Why is it already boiling?

505
00:42:50,162 --> 00:42:51,872
The current goes
directly into the water.

506
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:54,782
You can't stick a spoon in there.
Or you're dead.

507
00:42:58,845 --> 00:43:00,480
Are you crazy to use
anything like that?

508
00:43:02,182 --> 00:43:04,351
My ex-husband built it for me.

509
00:43:05,233 --> 00:43:07,754
Probably he
wanted to kill you!

510
00:43:11,457 --> 00:43:12,793
Thanks!

511
00:43:13,245 --> 00:43:15,003
Don't use that thing anymore!

512
00:43:16,789 --> 00:43:18,003
I am immortal.

513
00:43:33,838 --> 00:43:35,161
- Hello!
- Hello.

514
00:43:39,713 --> 00:43:42,352
My place?
I live around the corner.

515
00:43:46,683 --> 00:43:47,707
- Bye.
- Bye.

516
00:43:50,627 --> 00:43:51,999
Admit it, you didn't notice!

517
00:43:52,805 --> 00:43:55,082
Did you steal these?

518
00:43:55,083 --> 00:43:56,975
I wanted to get
ourselves a little treat.

519
00:44:32,058 --> 00:44:33,607
What else have you done?

520
00:44:34,148 --> 00:44:35,973
Danced in a bar.

521
00:44:37,054 --> 00:44:38,240
Really?

522
00:44:38,241 --> 00:44:40,189
Yes. First, I did pole dancing.

523
00:44:40,190 --> 00:44:43,770
Then I bent over, and everyone
could see into my butt.

524
00:44:46,257 --> 00:44:47,654
And what do you expect here?

525
00:44:48,485 --> 00:44:52,594
In the past, when a sailing ship
got into a dead calm,

526
00:44:52,595 --> 00:44:56,330
when no one brought up wind,
it was bad times.

527
00:44:56,870 --> 00:45:00,234
Then you spent Easter
off the Christmas islands...

528
00:45:04,318 --> 00:45:06,667
Strange, out of big glasses

529
00:45:06,668 --> 00:45:09,176
one can drink more
without getting drunk.

530
00:45:30,594 --> 00:45:31,817
You can stay here.

531
00:45:54,922 --> 00:45:56,857
I'm falling asleep.

532
00:47:19,174 --> 00:47:20,639
There was still
some left in there.

533
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:21,826
It's empty.

534
00:47:23,402 --> 00:47:26,065
You poured out the booze!

535
00:47:26,066 --> 00:47:27,203
Don't lie about it!

536
00:47:27,204 --> 00:47:28,910
You have thrown it away!

537
00:47:34,021 --> 00:47:35,433
Let me go!

538
00:47:37,598 --> 00:47:38,981
Give me the key!

539
00:47:40,998 --> 00:47:42,330
You think I can't climb?

540
00:47:49,287 --> 00:47:50,358
Tatjana!

541
00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:52,839
Tatjana!

542
00:47:56,647 --> 00:47:59,832
Do you know how much one bottle
costs, stupid western cow?

543
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:20,584
Step on the gas!

544
00:48:21,756 --> 00:48:23,436
And now, shift into second gear!

545
00:48:28,983 --> 00:48:31,515
Careful! What are you doing?

546
00:48:31,516 --> 00:48:33,280
Stay on the road!

547
00:48:35,208 --> 00:48:37,524
Clutch, take out the gear,
and now, break!

548
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:42,891
- How am I?
- The best!

549
00:48:42,892 --> 00:48:45,192
Turn around!
Drive down that path in reverse!

550
00:48:45,859 --> 00:48:48,829
How do I do that?
Push down on it, move it downwards.

551
00:48:49,246 --> 00:48:50,640
Accelerate, and steer.

552
00:49:10,299 --> 00:49:11,418
Damn!

553
00:49:11,850 --> 00:49:13,922
This is a new car!

554
00:49:13,923 --> 00:49:15,656
No worries.
It's Sunday.

555
00:49:23,218 --> 00:49:25,732
Lieutenant Knorz.
Who was driving?

556
00:49:26,099 --> 00:49:27,135
I did.

557
00:49:27,136 --> 00:49:29,462
License and registration, please!

558
00:49:37,477 --> 00:49:38,756
What have we done wrong?

559
00:49:42,286 --> 00:49:44,016
We drove against a tree
in reverse.

560
00:49:45,537 --> 00:49:47,867
Exactly.
And that's what you've done wrong.

561
00:49:49,693 --> 00:49:51,324
Have you had any alcohol?

562
00:49:51,325 --> 00:49:53,026
- No.
- Me neither.

563
00:50:07,903 --> 00:50:09,476
Follow me to the garage.

564
00:50:13,031 --> 00:50:14,611
- Please!
- Thanks.

565
00:50:32,232 --> 00:50:36,391
This is a friend from school.
She should've chosen him.

566
00:50:39,122 --> 00:50:41,408
She had bad luck with her marriage.

567
00:50:42,075 --> 00:50:43,809
Do you know that maybe...?

568
00:50:44,845 --> 00:50:47,046
She was too young

569
00:50:47,047 --> 00:50:49,349
and the husband
wasn't mature either.

570
00:50:51,752 --> 00:50:54,321
After the divorce, she dyed her hair.

571
00:50:56,126 --> 00:50:58,412
- Is your name Susanne?
- Susanne Schmidt.

572
00:50:59,893 --> 00:51:02,157
Nice to meet you. Margarethe.

573
00:51:05,781 --> 00:51:09,342
Cheers people,
all the best!

574
00:51:34,556 --> 00:51:36,914
Bloody incident at
the German-French border.

575
00:51:36,915 --> 00:51:40,718
Two men died when they
tried to skip border controls.

576
00:51:41,927 --> 00:51:46,907
One of them is alleged
terrorist Andreas Klein.

577
00:51:47,805 --> 00:51:50,310
His companion is
yet to be identified.

578
00:51:51,551 --> 00:51:55,115
The following people
are wanted:

579
00:51:55,768 --> 00:51:59,385
Fredericke Adebach, Joachim Klatte,

580
00:51:59,386 --> 00:52:02,289
Bernd Ruppel, Rita Vogt.

581
00:52:03,588 --> 00:52:05,993
She has a scar on the left elbow.

582
00:52:06,702 --> 00:52:11,365
Caution: Those people are armed.

583
00:52:18,963 --> 00:52:20,263
Let's go dancing!

584
00:52:55,342 --> 00:52:56,944
Susanne has been to Paris!

585
00:52:57,852 --> 00:53:00,579
She moved back here, nonetheless.

586
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:01,783
That's a rare case.

587
00:53:01,784 --> 00:53:05,686
The concept is better:
Less poverty, less richness.

588
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:10,257
Many people died for it,
all around the world.

589
00:53:13,861 --> 00:53:15,863
I've seen the Great Wall.

590
00:53:16,488 --> 00:53:18,644
They drove us there.

591
00:53:18,645 --> 00:53:20,833
But, especially the people!

592
00:53:20,834 --> 00:53:23,904
That's disappointing, all look alike.

593
00:53:26,039 --> 00:53:27,873
My father always
talks about China.

594
00:53:30,581 --> 00:53:32,034
Do you want some wine?

595
00:53:33,547 --> 00:53:34,671
Homemade.

596
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:39,613
My mother warned me about men.

597
00:54:40,932 --> 00:54:42,182
But never about women.

598
00:54:59,285 --> 00:55:00,836
I gotta leave.

599
00:55:28,315 --> 00:55:30,229
There are tomatoes from Bulgaria!

600
00:55:30,230 --> 00:55:31,899
Look, the colour!

601
00:55:33,818 --> 00:55:37,445
- I'll get some for us.
- I'll then cook Ratatouille.

602
00:55:37,446 --> 00:55:39,134
What?

603
00:55:39,135 --> 00:55:40,642
Ratatouille.

604
00:55:48,758 --> 00:55:50,651
Do you have a scar on your arm?

605
00:55:51,822 --> 00:55:52,831
Why?

606
00:55:55,396 --> 00:55:57,757
Ask her if she has a scar on her arm!

607
00:55:57,758 --> 00:55:59,560
It doesn't bother me.

608
00:56:00,846 --> 00:56:03,130
How is it to live with
such past life?

609
00:56:07,768 --> 00:56:10,204
- Hello!
- A call to Berlin.

610
00:56:15,685 --> 00:56:18,095
Please step into the phone booth!
I'm connecting.

611
00:56:24,505 --> 00:56:25,752
Someone recognized me.

612
00:56:27,694 --> 00:56:29,156
Can I go back to my house?

613
00:57:07,861 --> 00:57:09,730
- She saw you on the news?
- I think so.

614
00:57:10,187 --> 00:57:11,656
- Did you see it, too?
- Yes.

615
00:57:11,657 --> 00:57:13,179
Where?

616
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:14,819
At a birthday party.

617
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:16,069
Who's birthday?

618
00:57:16,782 --> 00:57:18,772
My colleague
Tatjana's father's.

619
00:57:20,037 --> 00:57:21,475
So, everybody has seen it?

620
00:57:21,933 --> 00:57:23,438
I was alone in the room.

621
00:57:26,649 --> 00:57:28,666
- I want to be entirely truthful.
- You should be.

622
00:57:29,781 --> 00:57:31,492
Tatjana stood in the door.

623
00:57:32,752 --> 00:57:34,198
But not from the very beginning.

624
00:57:35,454 --> 00:57:36,990
I don't know since when.

625
00:57:37,393 --> 00:57:39,618
But she hasn't
said anything yet.

626
00:57:40,243 --> 00:57:41,428
You stay here for now.

627
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:48,869
- I'm working early shift tomorrow.
- We'll take care of that.

628
00:57:49,307 --> 00:57:50,838
Someone will miss me too.

629
00:57:51,702 --> 00:57:54,308
You have many friends,
this we already know.

630
00:57:56,442 --> 00:57:58,045
She bought tomatoes
for dinner.

631
00:57:59,843 --> 00:58:01,647
She won't get it.
Rumours are spread.

632
00:58:01,648 --> 00:58:03,450
I don't want to behave this way.

633
00:58:05,193 --> 00:58:06,820
Write a letter.

634
00:58:08,332 --> 00:58:10,057
You'll be back in a couple of days.

635
00:58:13,666 --> 00:58:15,229
We'll deliver it immediately.

636
00:58:20,110 --> 00:58:21,602
- When shall I come back?
- Soon.

637
00:58:30,658 --> 00:58:33,805
Dear Tatjana, I'm in a big hurry,
I need to help a friend.

638
00:58:33,806 --> 00:58:35,983
It won't take long.

639
00:58:36,469 --> 00:58:38,228
Don't overthink it.
It is how it is.

640
00:58:50,139 --> 00:58:51,847
Sad story, the thing with Andi.

641
00:58:53,341 --> 00:58:54,347
Very sad.

642
00:58:55,802 --> 00:58:57,044
He didn't stand a chance.

643
00:59:01,648 --> 00:59:02,661
You can't go back.

644
00:59:04,858 --> 00:59:06,381
What do you mean?

645
00:59:06,382 --> 00:59:07,581
What I said.

646
00:59:08,589 --> 00:59:10,184
Why did you allow me
to write the letter then?

647
00:59:11,683 --> 00:59:13,206
Because we needed time.

648
00:59:18,162 --> 00:59:19,965
But I want to
go back to Tatjana.

649
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:23,730
- How's that supposed to work?
- That's my condition.

650
00:59:25,626 --> 00:59:27,366
Since when are you giving conditions?

651
00:59:28,417 --> 00:59:30,704
Do you know what would happen
if your cover was blown?

652
00:59:31,825 --> 00:59:35,142
The GDR has signed international
anti-terrorism treaties.

653
00:59:35,670 --> 00:59:40,480
Lives can be easily ruined through
something like that, not only yours.

654
00:59:46,543 --> 00:59:48,779
Are you actually interested in people?

655
00:59:51,656 --> 00:59:53,195
This is our job.

656
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:09,148
We usually deal with male comrades.

657
01:00:10,829 --> 01:00:14,882
My husband was a lieutenant,
until he retired.

658
01:00:16,805 --> 01:00:18,952
Anyway,
we always lived in the suburb.

659
01:00:30,697 --> 01:00:31,932
20:12

660
01:00:34,635 --> 01:00:35,803
21:12

661
01:00:38,572 --> 01:00:41,207
Hold on. Rematch!

662
01:00:49,252 --> 01:00:52,398
- How did you carry these things?
- I'll show you.

663
01:01:02,829 --> 01:01:03,897
You walk differently.

664
01:01:04,598 --> 01:01:06,834
Your body centre
and movements are altered.

665
01:01:08,505 --> 01:01:10,037
Doesn't the skin get cold?

666
01:01:10,838 --> 01:01:12,477
The gun gets warm.

667
01:01:14,541 --> 01:01:16,044
Are you insane?

668
01:01:16,045 --> 01:01:17,210
Why wasn't the safety engaged?

669
01:01:17,211 --> 01:01:19,180
- It was!
- No!

670
01:01:19,181 --> 01:01:22,049
I'm not stupid!
You've already shot someone before!

671
01:01:27,129 --> 01:01:31,158
I helped him with accounting.
He died at the age of 32.

672
01:01:31,612 --> 01:01:33,696
I didn't want to be a widow.
Please, come in.

673
01:01:37,684 --> 01:01:39,437
You aren't asleep yet.

674
01:01:39,438 --> 01:01:41,135
I'm practising
for my third life.

675
01:01:43,348 --> 01:01:46,440
Sabine Walter.
Too young to live a widow's life.

676
01:01:48,609 --> 01:01:52,012
This time, you're from the East.
There will be less questions.

677
01:01:55,649 --> 01:01:57,444
Maybe you should...

678
01:01:59,609 --> 01:02:00,988
..wear glasses.

679
01:02:03,825 --> 01:02:05,359
You're pretty anyway.

680
01:02:12,144 --> 01:02:13,534
A cat has seven lives.

681
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:16,637
Are you married?

682
01:02:17,790 --> 01:02:18,805
Yes.

683
01:02:21,702 --> 01:02:23,076
It's important to be married.

684
01:02:34,696 --> 01:02:38,358
You should visit your colleague.
I think it would be possible.

685
01:02:39,591 --> 01:02:41,399
The story needs a closing.

686
01:03:08,821 --> 01:03:11,057
- Who's there?
- Susanne.

687
01:03:28,252 --> 01:03:29,710
You look different.

688
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:31,355
You too.

689
01:03:34,748 --> 01:03:38,752
I knew you'd get in touch
as soon as you can.

690
01:03:39,241 --> 01:03:40,755
I often checked
if your Trabbi was here.

691
01:03:40,756 --> 01:03:42,590
I didn't want to
abandon you.

692
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:44,390
I think it's great that I know you.

693
01:03:44,391 --> 01:03:48,362
You are so important, compared to me.

694
01:04:06,467 --> 01:04:07,873
I wanted to
say goodbye.

695
01:04:10,317 --> 01:04:11,819
I'm going back
to West Germany.

696
01:04:12,431 --> 01:04:13,975
Because of my family.

697
01:04:15,489 --> 01:04:17,171
But your parents are dead.

698
01:04:17,172 --> 01:04:18,425
I have siblings.

699
01:04:28,268 --> 01:04:29,803
Don't use that hellish
device anymore!

700
01:04:29,985 --> 01:04:31,873
- What?
- That thing you use to make coffee.

701
01:04:31,874 --> 01:04:35,042
People say you are a wanted
terrorist in West Germany.

702
01:04:36,677 --> 01:04:39,246
If that was true,
I couldn't return there.

703
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:42,482
When they mentioned
the scar, I knew.

704
01:04:42,904 --> 01:04:46,220
I'm your friend.
Talk to me!

705
01:04:50,359 --> 01:04:51,819
You are mistaken, Tatjana.

706
01:04:53,665 --> 01:04:55,679
I beg you to believe me!

707
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:15,180
Are you going to write?

708
01:05:16,390 --> 01:05:17,391
Sure!

709
01:05:20,313 --> 01:05:21,655
Yes, sure.

710
01:05:22,263 --> 01:05:24,803
Stop messing with me!

711
01:05:27,327 --> 01:05:28,602
I'll come with you.

712
01:06:03,261 --> 01:06:04,665
I'll be back soon.

713
01:06:11,962 --> 01:06:13,330
I'll be gone then.

714
01:06:24,952 --> 01:06:27,398
- Can I sit in the back?
- Go ahead.

715
01:06:29,467 --> 01:06:31,491
That was quick.
What did she say?

716
01:06:31,935 --> 01:06:34,261
That she's my girlfriend.

717
01:06:52,585 --> 01:06:53,890
Excuse me.

718
01:06:55,603 --> 01:06:57,070
The kitchen.

719
01:07:14,575 --> 01:07:17,004
A couple of lamps will
be delivered soon.

720
01:07:21,412 --> 01:07:24,311
We've unpacked everything.
Except for the books.

721
01:07:27,281 --> 01:07:28,749
Call if there's any problem.

722
01:07:29,455 --> 01:07:31,186
I would like to join the party.

723
01:07:31,187 --> 01:07:33,020
You always need to be
truthful with the party.

724
01:07:33,853 --> 01:07:35,030
Always.

725
01:07:35,989 --> 01:07:37,124
Can you do that?

726
01:08:01,515 --> 01:08:03,092
Good morning!

727
01:08:05,256 --> 01:08:06,820
This is your workplace.

728
01:08:07,554 --> 01:08:10,524
Mrs. Walter is going to prepare
the children's summer vacation.

729
01:08:11,091 --> 01:08:14,360
She used to work
in her husband's shop.

730
01:08:14,361 --> 01:08:15,396
- Yes.

731
01:08:15,397 --> 01:08:17,246
- Tea?
- No, thank you.

732
01:08:18,765 --> 01:08:21,068
Your new colleagues
will show you around.

733
01:08:43,770 --> 01:08:45,859
- Are those the old ones?
- Yes.

734
01:09:02,209 --> 01:09:05,811
I'm Christa.
These are Beate and Monika.

735
01:09:05,812 --> 01:09:07,215
We call each other by names.

736
01:09:07,216 --> 01:09:08,401
My name is Sabine.

737
01:09:37,182 --> 01:09:38,223
Morning!

738
01:09:46,431 --> 01:09:49,247
I've written down
whom we need:

739
01:09:49,248 --> 01:09:50,790
Trade union,
trade union committee,

740
01:09:50,791 --> 01:09:53,228
official youth organization,
the mayor,

741
01:09:53,229 --> 01:09:56,495
the Hygiene, the youth's welfare,
railroad, German Red Cross,

742
01:09:56,496 --> 01:09:59,154
public administration, canteen,
construction management,

743
01:09:59,155 --> 01:10:01,168
and the children's commission.
All at the same table!

744
01:10:06,703 --> 01:10:08,040
Can you swim?

745
01:10:28,215 --> 01:10:29,863
Don't go that far!

746
01:10:40,414 --> 01:10:43,344
Are you keeping an eye
on the children?

747
01:10:43,345 --> 01:10:44,678
Yes.

748
01:10:51,047 --> 01:10:52,772
Then I am going to
keep an eye on you.

749
01:10:54,588 --> 01:10:55,889
My name is Jochen Pettka.

750
01:11:16,001 --> 01:11:18,979
- Good night!
- Good night, Sabine!

751
01:11:29,286 --> 01:11:30,456
What are you reading?

752
01:11:30,457 --> 01:11:32,826
"The Physics
of the Next Millennium".

753
01:11:34,615 --> 01:11:38,932
Here's a nice sentence:
"Innovation is what you cannot see."

754
01:11:39,668 --> 01:11:43,722
Seeing something new from time
to time is what's beautiful in life.

755
01:11:44,543 --> 01:11:46,539
Does that mean things never play
out as you would expect them to?

756
01:11:46,540 --> 01:11:47,540
Yes.

757
01:11:49,385 --> 01:11:50,844
Thanks God, not always.

758
01:11:58,835 --> 01:12:01,588
This is my third summer here,
as a lifeguard.

759
01:12:02,157 --> 01:12:04,790
You've already been
here a couple of times?

760
01:12:04,791 --> 01:12:07,461
Yes, I know a lot of people.

761
01:12:17,739 --> 01:12:19,938
There are beautiful eyes
hidden behind your glasses.

762
01:12:52,478 --> 01:12:54,882
You were killing it!

763
01:12:57,233 --> 01:12:58,545
Do you think so?

764
01:13:24,905 --> 01:13:26,105
Ouch!

765
01:13:26,106 --> 01:13:29,376
- Am I hurting you?
- No, it's just my sunburn.

766
01:13:35,115 --> 01:13:37,985
Noon rest till 3pm!

767
01:13:56,003 --> 01:13:58,516
- What's that ship?
- Ferry to Sweden.

768
01:14:00,103 --> 01:14:01,908
Why do so many people
want to leave?

769
01:14:06,754 --> 01:14:08,780
I've never been on a vacation
at the Baltic Sea!

770
01:15:19,624 --> 01:15:21,355
We are going soon.

771
01:15:21,828 --> 01:15:24,925
- Let me introduce my husband.
- Sabine Walter.

772
01:15:25,037 --> 01:15:28,462
We've met while travelling.

773
01:15:30,387 --> 01:15:32,166
See you in a minute, in the bus!
Excuse me.

774
01:15:36,807 --> 01:15:38,792
Let's just sit down for a second!

775
01:15:42,396 --> 01:15:44,644
It's a pity that we don't have time.

776
01:15:44,645 --> 01:15:45,645
Yes.

777
01:15:57,658 --> 01:15:59,693
This is my son, Eric.

778
01:16:03,252 --> 01:16:05,399
- Glad to hear you're well.
- Why do you think that?

779
01:16:09,784 --> 01:16:10,790
I'm coming.

780
01:16:35,889 --> 01:16:40,033
This is our gratitude for your
commitment to the summer vacation.

781
01:16:40,934 --> 01:16:44,805
As they say: Children are our
most valuable good.

782
01:16:45,939 --> 01:16:48,075
The documents are in the files.

783
01:16:52,580 --> 01:16:53,771
Thank you.

784
01:16:55,467 --> 01:16:57,267
Thank you very much!

785
01:17:05,465 --> 01:17:07,770
Is that really an award
for your sleeping around?

786
01:17:07,771 --> 01:17:10,464
- You shouldn't say things like that!
- I have nothing against it.

787
01:17:11,274 --> 01:17:13,543
But if I do this, I need to have
emotions involved.

788
01:17:36,390 --> 01:17:37,720
Come in!

789
01:17:48,192 --> 01:17:49,666
Hang up your coat!

790
01:17:51,171 --> 01:17:52,939
Are you from Berlin?

791
01:17:54,053 --> 01:17:55,056
Thank you!

792
01:18:01,248 --> 01:18:03,383
Why haven't you got
in touch sooner?

793
01:18:11,308 --> 01:18:13,093
I want to marry you.

794
01:18:15,314 --> 01:18:16,964
I want you to marry me.

795
01:18:19,699 --> 01:18:21,002
It's a big opportunity for me.

796
01:18:21,003 --> 01:18:23,272
Five years,
one in a million gets this.

797
01:18:26,392 --> 01:18:29,411
It's situated in the woods,
But they have everything:

798
01:18:29,412 --> 01:18:33,515
Swimming pool, horse riding,
cinema, theatre.

799
01:18:33,516 --> 01:18:35,023
And Moscow isn't that far away.

800
01:18:35,261 --> 01:18:37,395
And you can come with your wife.

801
01:18:38,252 --> 01:18:40,221
And I thought: maybe I have one.

802
01:18:40,222 --> 01:18:42,824
- And I am going to ask her.
- And what am I going to do there?

803
01:18:42,825 --> 01:18:44,857
You will be my wife.

804
01:18:44,858 --> 01:18:47,095
What will I be doing as your wife?

805
01:18:47,096 --> 01:18:48,829
You will be the mother of my children.

806
01:18:49,882 --> 01:18:51,365
It sounds a little stupid, I know.

807
01:18:52,065 --> 01:18:54,065
I'll be the mother of your children?

808
01:18:55,502 --> 01:18:57,504
You don't take it seriously, do you?

809
01:18:58,589 --> 01:18:59,636
I do.

810
01:19:10,751 --> 01:19:12,219
Put it away!

811
01:19:22,495 --> 01:19:24,098
Why are you wearing glasses?

812
01:19:25,167 --> 01:19:26,174
For fun!

813
01:19:27,290 --> 01:19:29,203
- Why didn't you tell me?
- What for?

814
01:19:30,425 --> 01:19:33,440
I thought, I knew you,
but glasses made of plain glass!

815
01:19:34,208 --> 01:19:35,976
Glasses without a purpose?

816
01:19:36,734 --> 01:19:38,306
Can we just change the topic?

817
01:19:45,325 --> 01:19:47,187
Please, you don't need the be angry!

818
01:19:47,805 --> 01:19:51,058
Maybe somebody once told you were
more beautiful with glasses.

819
01:20:35,936 --> 01:20:38,668
- Are you taking the pill?
- Do I have to?

820
01:20:47,281 --> 01:20:50,917
Hello. Here I am.

821
01:20:50,918 --> 01:20:52,052
I am glad.

822
01:20:58,597 --> 01:20:59,993
We thought about it.

823
01:21:02,095 --> 01:21:03,330
It is out of question.

824
01:21:04,050 --> 01:21:06,200
We can't keep your identity
a secret from the Russians.

825
01:21:07,501 --> 01:21:10,504
We don't want to tell them.
Cause it'd be too messy.

826
01:21:11,474 --> 01:21:13,397
Do you think that you
can control everything?!

827
01:21:15,395 --> 01:21:17,745
No, but that's the way it is.

828
01:21:19,913 --> 01:21:21,366
But I want to go there, with him!

829
01:21:22,504 --> 01:21:25,786
We love each other and we
are going to have a child!

830
01:21:30,143 --> 01:21:31,993
You don't have to have a child.

831
01:21:35,987 --> 01:21:38,088
And if I have one anyway?

832
01:21:40,089 --> 01:21:41,368
Are you watching West German TV?

833
01:21:42,703 --> 01:21:43,738
Why?

834
01:21:43,739 --> 01:21:47,609
They show GDR women
holding up their children,

835
01:21:47,610 --> 01:21:51,111
when they climb into the West German
embassy in Prague.

836
01:21:53,354 --> 01:21:55,282
Do you see something like
that on GDR television?

837
01:21:57,794 --> 01:21:58,862
Do you see?

838
01:22:00,536 --> 01:22:02,523
Some people in this
country are asleep.

839
01:22:03,255 --> 01:22:04,925
Those are my worries
at the moment.

840
01:22:05,946 --> 01:22:08,128
So I am asking for your understanding.

841
01:22:18,107 --> 01:22:20,074
If I don't go to Moscow,

842
01:22:20,933 --> 01:22:22,345
would you stay here?

843
01:22:24,757 --> 01:22:25,780
Why?

844
01:22:26,780 --> 01:22:28,780
If I can't go.

845
01:22:33,586 --> 01:22:35,121
But that's why we are
going to get married!

846
01:22:35,122 --> 01:22:36,961
Even if I won't come with you?

847
01:22:36,962 --> 01:22:38,225
What do you mean?

848
01:22:38,861 --> 01:22:40,494
I don't understand.

849
01:22:46,052 --> 01:22:48,068
I'll tell you who the mother
of your children really is.

850
01:22:51,673 --> 01:22:53,512
I live here under a false name,

851
01:22:53,513 --> 01:22:55,442
with the consent
of the concerned agencies,

852
01:22:58,316 --> 01:23:00,314
because in the West,
I'm wanted as a terrorist.

853
01:23:09,710 --> 01:23:12,426
Are you a terrorist?

854
01:23:13,910 --> 01:23:14,965
Yes.

855
01:23:16,740 --> 01:23:18,176
I used to be.

856
01:23:30,177 --> 01:23:32,980
But terrorists are idiots
who kill innocent people.

857
01:23:34,708 --> 01:23:36,444
Yes, that's what I used to do.

858
01:23:38,299 --> 01:23:40,451
But you can't tell me this!

859
01:23:41,499 --> 01:23:43,156
I am not allowed to know this!

860
01:23:46,995 --> 01:23:50,063
I have to go there now, though.

861
01:24:01,808 --> 01:24:03,986
No. 15, please step forward!

862
01:24:32,551 --> 01:24:33,804
Please, take a seat.

863
01:24:43,634 --> 01:24:44,729
Cigarette?

864
01:24:54,521 --> 01:24:55,606
I came from Berlin.

865
01:24:57,831 --> 01:24:59,023
Whatever.

866
01:25:01,349 --> 01:25:03,871
This concerns
an ex-colleague of yours.

867
01:25:05,339 --> 01:25:07,187
Maybe a girlfriend.

868
01:25:10,289 --> 01:25:12,980
- She's not here anymore.
- We know that.

869
01:25:18,385 --> 01:25:19,953
I'll tell you what I know.

870
01:25:21,747 --> 01:25:25,426
She immigrated into the GDR
a long time ago, from the West.

871
01:25:25,427 --> 01:25:27,137
- I didn't believe it at first.
- Why not?

872
01:25:28,473 --> 01:25:30,764
I had never heard
of anything like that before.

873
01:25:31,503 --> 01:25:33,893
But she was left, politically.

874
01:25:34,968 --> 01:25:38,323
Her parents were killed
in an accident in Amsterdam.

875
01:25:40,374 --> 01:25:44,411
She found out that she has siblings
in the West, so she moved back.

876
01:25:45,967 --> 01:25:46,972
Unfortunately.

877
01:25:47,980 --> 01:25:49,883
She was different
from all the others in the factory.

878
01:25:52,619 --> 01:25:55,422
She was a strong supporter of the GDR,
something not everyone is.

879
01:25:57,045 --> 01:25:58,926
I can't say anything bad
about her in this context.

880
01:26:01,518 --> 01:26:04,231
Have others talked about her?

881
01:26:07,825 --> 01:26:09,019
No, not really.
I don't think so.

882
01:26:10,842 --> 01:26:13,173
But I want to know,
why have I been arrested?

883
01:26:20,053 --> 01:26:22,253
I'm offering you a deal.

884
01:26:23,417 --> 01:26:26,120
You agree, informally,
that we stay in touch.

885
01:26:30,293 --> 01:26:31,725
Then you can go home.

886
01:26:32,482 --> 01:26:35,763
It's a sign that you are
loyal to the republic.

887
01:26:45,114 --> 01:26:47,206
Tatjana...

888
01:26:47,207 --> 01:26:49,710
the wall is gone now,

889
01:26:50,711 --> 01:26:52,579
and the border is open.

890
01:26:53,796 --> 01:26:56,817
It's just like how
you always wanted it to be.

891
01:26:58,764 --> 01:27:00,227
But you are in prison,

892
01:27:01,291 --> 01:27:03,457
because you were in touch
with a terrorist.

893
01:27:04,065 --> 01:27:07,594
And this didn't happen to you
in the West, but in the East.

894
01:27:07,960 --> 01:27:09,227
That's crazy.

895
01:27:10,619 --> 01:27:12,065
It is certain

896
01:27:13,233 --> 01:27:17,272
that nothing in the other
part of Germany,

897
01:27:17,804 --> 01:27:20,741
is ever going to be
the same as it used to be.

898
01:27:22,107 --> 01:27:25,112
I'm writing down what
I'd say if you were here.

899
01:27:26,718 --> 01:27:30,117
I imagined a life without
lies and deception, as you did.

900
01:27:30,807 --> 01:27:32,152
And a different one.

901
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:35,823
It was clear to me, we are trapped
in an unjust, wrong system.

902
01:27:36,256 --> 01:27:39,893
The guerilla couldn't achieve liberty,
because no one understood us.

903
01:27:41,036 --> 01:27:42,262
When I arrived here,

904
01:27:42,943 --> 01:27:44,598
I didn't want to hide.

905
01:27:45,195 --> 01:27:47,468
I was looking for another world.

906
01:27:48,014 --> 01:27:50,390
I wanted to move forwards,
not backwards.

907
01:27:51,498 --> 01:27:53,040
I hope you'll
manage to get out soon.

908
01:27:54,187 --> 01:27:55,463
You may come in.

909
01:28:03,374 --> 01:28:05,753
The Federal Republic of Germany

910
01:28:05,754 --> 01:28:08,222
demands the extradition
of these people.

911
01:28:11,977 --> 01:28:13,560
How do they know
they are here?

912
01:28:14,210 --> 01:28:15,562
They've always known.

913
01:28:17,045 --> 01:28:19,066
- From whom?
- Maybe from us.

914
01:28:35,078 --> 01:28:37,129
Why did we hide them then?

915
01:28:40,213 --> 01:28:41,922
Twice, even!

916
01:28:42,809 --> 01:28:45,018
We worked our butts off
to hide them.

917
01:28:46,784 --> 01:28:48,462
Excuse me, comrade general.

918
01:28:49,799 --> 01:28:52,641
I've arrested people,
because they might have known.

919
01:28:55,191 --> 01:28:58,505
I can't believe, it was just a game!
Like in a secret agent movie scene!

920
01:28:58,778 --> 01:29:01,909
If you don't explain the world to me,
I won't explain it to you either.

921
01:29:02,487 --> 01:29:03,744
Do you have the address?

922
01:29:04,636 --> 01:29:06,647
This is not an easy task.

923
01:29:07,445 --> 01:29:09,716
You have to manipulate a lot here...

924
01:29:13,506 --> 01:29:16,190
We've done something for them,
not the other way round.

925
01:29:18,384 --> 01:29:20,588
They didn't tell us much
about their secrets.

926
01:29:22,732 --> 01:29:26,066
Maybe they were criminals.
You can look at it like that.

927
01:29:27,734 --> 01:29:30,471
But I'm disappointed
that we abandon them like this.

928
01:29:30,472 --> 01:29:32,540
Why don't you go home and cry?

929
01:29:32,541 --> 01:29:34,374
Your weapons, please!

930
01:29:53,312 --> 01:29:54,994
That's how accidents happen, girl!

931
01:29:54,995 --> 01:29:56,897
I'm sorry!

932
01:29:57,846 --> 01:29:59,933
Look!
Unbelievable!

933
01:30:00,777 --> 01:30:03,571
"Terrorist hidden by StaSi."

934
01:30:03,572 --> 01:30:04,872
What do you think about it?

935
01:30:05,343 --> 01:30:08,013
There you spend your time
with robbers and murders.

936
01:30:08,342 --> 01:30:09,610
Anything for peace!

937
01:30:10,528 --> 01:30:14,148
She was part of a choir.
They had money for things like that!

938
01:30:14,648 --> 01:30:16,618
But we couldn't get decent Jeans.

939
01:30:16,619 --> 01:30:18,819
She didn't do anything
to or against YOU,

940
01:30:19,486 --> 01:30:20,654
I mean, US.

941
01:30:21,066 --> 01:30:22,655
She didn't do anything against us.

942
01:30:22,656 --> 01:30:25,893
One cannot live next to
a murderer, though!

943
01:30:26,379 --> 01:30:27,561
This isn't my government anymore.

944
01:30:28,278 --> 01:30:30,431
Maybe you'll never be
better off than now and here!

945
01:30:30,964 --> 01:30:34,735
Here, you cannot lose your job
or be kicked out of your apartment.

946
01:30:35,564 --> 01:30:37,271
You have no idea,
what's going to happen.

947
01:30:37,624 --> 01:30:38,939
You have no idea what you are losing.

948
01:30:39,476 --> 01:30:41,376
Maybe you'll be able
to afford decent trousers,

949
01:30:41,377 --> 01:30:44,411
but not the butt
in those trousers.

950
01:30:44,906 --> 01:30:46,742
I assume, you lost your mind.

951
01:30:48,172 --> 01:30:49,718
This here was a great attempt,

952
01:30:50,317 --> 01:30:51,718
a revolution.

953
01:30:52,271 --> 01:30:54,288
Despite all the crap,
you were part of it.

954
01:30:55,128 --> 01:30:57,991
It's supposed to be a world
that isn't ruled by money.

955
01:30:58,956 --> 01:31:00,260
Why don't you believe in that anymore?

956
01:31:01,128 --> 01:31:02,863
In yourselves anymore?

957
01:31:36,716 --> 01:31:38,204
We can't do anything for you anymore.

958
01:31:39,446 --> 01:31:40,492
What happened to Friederike?

959
01:31:41,193 --> 01:31:42,385
You don't know?

960
01:31:42,386 --> 01:31:44,532
I do.
But what happened?

961
01:31:45,870 --> 01:31:47,307
They are going to get you, too.

962
01:31:47,824 --> 01:31:49,511
This is still the GDR, though!

963
01:31:49,512 --> 01:31:53,247
And in the GDR, you are going to be
arrested, through the people's police.

964
01:31:54,873 --> 01:31:56,540
What a messed-up ending.

965
01:32:01,175 --> 01:32:04,792
East is over there,
West over there.

966
01:32:07,528 --> 01:32:08,862
You are wanted everywhere.

967
01:32:09,662 --> 01:32:12,146
If they cannot find you today,
they are going to hunt you down.

968
01:32:13,432 --> 01:32:15,608
Avoid airports and big train stations.

969
01:32:18,125 --> 01:32:20,287
If you can, forget
we've ever known each other.

970
01:32:22,761 --> 01:32:24,232
I will also forget it.

971
01:32:30,160 --> 01:32:32,478
I can at least give you a ride.

972
01:32:36,408 --> 01:32:38,549
Why have you arrested Tatjana?

973
01:33:15,824 --> 01:33:19,251
Susanne!
Open up, it's me!

974
01:33:30,511 --> 01:33:31,745
Hands up!

975
01:33:34,566 --> 01:33:35,699
Against the wall!

976
01:33:38,385 --> 01:33:39,434
Are you Rita Vogt?

977
01:33:46,098 --> 01:33:47,440
Go faster!

978
01:34:01,128 --> 01:34:02,348
I need to go to the toilet.

979
01:34:06,312 --> 01:34:09,550
Actually, I cannot take
you with me without a helmet.

980
01:34:10,554 --> 01:34:12,453
You don't know that
as an Eastern broad.

981
01:34:13,368 --> 01:34:15,322
You were pretty much cut off.

982
01:34:16,225 --> 01:34:18,826
But I don't have any prejudices.

983
01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:20,227
Thanks.

984
01:34:20,228 --> 01:34:23,730
It not any individual's fault.
Excuse me, I need to pee.

985
01:34:54,795 --> 01:34:56,132
This is the East.

986
01:34:57,233 --> 01:35:01,602
- She has killed several people.
- Here or in the West?

987
01:35:02,269 --> 01:35:04,036
Doesn't matter,

988
01:35:04,037 --> 01:35:06,741
order and security
are equal everywhere.

989
01:35:06,742 --> 01:35:07,975
I won't shoot.

990
01:35:11,359 --> 01:35:12,405
Documents, please.

991
01:36:17,681 --> 01:36:21,915
THINGS WERE LIKE THIS
BUT NOT EXACTLY.

992
01:36:22,305 --> 01:37:22,743
