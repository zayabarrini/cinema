1
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:40,280
DIGITALLY RESTORED IN 2015

2
00:00:55,681 --> 00:01:00,016
THROUGH A GLASS DARKLY

3
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:58,738
TO KÃ„BI
MY WIFE

4
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:42,944
I was first up on the jetty!

5
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,621
That was refreshing.

6
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:48,871
If Papa and Martin put out the nets,
Minus and I will get the milk.

7
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:53,170
No, David and Minus can put out the nets
so I can take my wife for a walk.

8
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:57,216
Can't Karin and I put out the nets,
while Minus and Martin get the milk?

9
00:02:57,302 --> 00:03:01,888
I won't do either.
I'll decide for myself what I want to do.

10
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:04,966
I haven't seen you all day, Minus.
Let's go.

11
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,017
Why should women always decide?

12
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:12,816
I say we do as Karin says.
That way we won't lose our dignity.

13
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:16,315
Think of the time we'd have saved
if Papa had decided that right off.

14
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:22,742
Should we get dressed
before we put out the nets?

15
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:24,285
What do you think?

16
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,579
- Isn't it rather chilly?
- You think?

17
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:28,327
My bathrobe is thinner than yours.

18
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:31,376
- If you're cold...
- Me cold? Not a bit. Are you?

19
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:36,126
You're the one who said it was chilly.
There is a bit of a breeze, though.

20
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,709
We'll harden ourselves.
Virility overrules health, right?

21
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:43,592
If Hemingway could do it, so can we.
Forward march.

22
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:10,456
Think there'll be a thunderstorm?

23
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:11,908
No, not tonight.

24
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:14,585
I don't know. Look at those clouds.

25
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:16,834
Are you afraid of thunder?

26
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,666
You have no idea how terrified I am of it.

27
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,594
When it would roll through the Alps,
God help us.

28
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,592
- Did you like it there otherwise?
- I was homesick.

29
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:29,426
But I wasn't coming home
until I'd finished the novel.

30
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,101
And now it's finished?

31
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:33,475
Yes, pretty much.

32
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:35,602
- How's your ulcer?
- So-so.

33
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:39,185
Can you prescribe something?
It hurts due to the climate change.

34
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:43,114
We'll go to the pharmacy tomorrow.
I have errands to run anyway.

35
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:49,450
Did you get my last letter?
I sent it on Monday.

36
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:52,532
I was in Basel visiting the Waldsteins.
They send their regards.

37
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,083
Then you didn't get it.

38
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:56,957
- I flew here on Wednesday.
- Then you didn't get it.

39
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:00,923
- Was it important?
- It was about Karin.

40
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:07,255
I felt I had to write,
even if it disturbed your writing.

41
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:22,191
- A cuckoo. Didn't you hear it?
- No.

42
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:25,531
- Surely you hear it now.
- Where?

43
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:26,617
There.

44
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,527
When did you wash your ears out last?

45
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:31,533
Stop it. Yours are too sensitive.

46
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:35,367
It's strange, but since my illness,
my hearing has become so acute.

47
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,702
Maybe it's the electric-shock therapy.

48
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:42,568
How did Papa look to you yesterday
when he arrived from Switzerland?

49
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,675
- How do you mean?
- I thought he looked gray.

50
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:47,219
- Tired from the journey, I suppose.
- Probably.

51
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:49,217
But he doesn't seem happy.

52
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:53,642
- Is Marianne coming here?
- Martin said they broke up.

53
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,720
Poor Papa. Alone again.

54
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:57,771
I never liked Marianne.

55
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:00,066
She put on such airs,

56
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:02,313
and poor Papa looked so ordinary
next to her.

57
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:04,817
And then she sneered at his books.

58
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:08,115
Papa has to get good reviews on this book.

59
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,942
But everybody reads his books.

60
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,904
He doesn't care about the sales.

61
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:15,035
He wants to be a writer.

62
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,577
What are you laughing at?

63
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,122
You're so tall and so serious.

64
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,674
"He wants to be a writer."

65
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:31,590
Don't look so hurt.
I love you, little Minus.

66
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,310
You've grown so tall.
- Stop being so silly.

67
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:40,355
Seventeen and nearly ten feet tall.

68
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:44,568
Where's your girlfriend?
- Who'd want to be with me?

69
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:47,067
Don't be mad because I laughed at you.

70
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,468
Edgar is the only psychiatrist I trust.

71
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,341
He's treated her all along.

72
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,098
And?

73
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:18,845
When Karin came home
from the hospital last month,

74
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,559
he and I had a good talk.

75
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,146
He couldn't guarantee
a permanent recovery.

76
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:28,197
And now?

77
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:31,945
She seems unusually well.

78
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,739
She hasn't been sleeping well.

79
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:38,326
Her hearing has become very acute.
That's about it.

80
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:41,792
How much does she know?

81
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:45,963
She actually knows the whole truth
about her illness,

82
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:47,915
but not that it's relatively incurable.

83
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,420
You say "relatively"?

84
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:55,390
Edgar has had cases of full recovery,
so there is hope.

85
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:59,802
How are things between you?

86
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,432
Fine, thank you.

87
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,932
The days pass by as usual.

88
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:10,397
I've given my lectures all spring
and examined numerous students.

89
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,906
I've come to realize that I love her

90
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:21,116
and that I'm helplessly bound to her,
whatever happens.

91
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:26,253
I've become the anchor of her existence,

92
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,082
perhaps her only security.

93
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:31,588
I see.

94
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:36,422
Well, shall we put out the nets?

95
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,054
Yes, let's.

96
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:09,755
Hey.

97
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,166
Be careful now.

98
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,710
Keep away from me.

99
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,887
Stop hugging and kissing me.

100
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:19,340
Stop sunbathing half-naked.
You disgust me.

101
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:24,011
You know very well what I mean.
Women are horrible.

102
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:27,565
How they smell and move around,
how they stick out their stomachs,

103
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,733
how they comb their hair and talk.

104
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:33,278
Makes me feel like a skinned rabbit.
- Poor boy.

105
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:38,530
Thanks.
I can give myself all the pity I want.

106
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:42,955
What's wrong?
I've never seen you like this.

107
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:48,078
Please don't tell Martin or Papa.

108
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,038
Don't be silly.

109
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,842
I wish I could talk to Papa, just once.

110
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,262
He's so wrapped up in himself.

111
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:01,640
Him too.

112
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:03,888
Let's go home.

113
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:09,144
- I spilled the milk.
- Careless boy.

114
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:19,151
Damn! I hate it when I hurt my finger.

115
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:20,655
Put a bandage on it.

116
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,407
Hello.

117
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:25,489
- Martin cut his finger.
- Let's have a look.

118
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,874
I'll put the milk in the cellar.

119
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:31,625
- It looks deep. Put a bandage on it.
- So much fuss over a little finger.

120
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:35,208
Isn't it beautiful...
supper by lantern and moonlight?

121
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:44,179
- You're a master chef, Papa.
- It smells wonderful.

122
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:45,805
Smell it, Minus.

123
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:50,932
You should write cookbooks
instead of novels.

124
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:56,691
How shall we sit?
Karin there, and you over there.

125
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,898
Minus over there, and me here.

126
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:04,199
How I've longed for this moment.
- Why?

127
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:05,996
I was homesick the whole time.

128
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:09,075
- For us?
- Yes, even for you.

129
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,669
Are you staying?

130
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,712
For this month, at least.

131
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,290
Are you going away again?

132
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:20,298
I'm in charge of a tour to Yugoslavia.

133
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:22,050
In charge of a tour? Why?

134
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,177
It's a very flattering offer.

135
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:26,884
A cultural delegation.

136
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:29,265
Since I know the country, why not?

137
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:34,225
Well, cheers, David. Welcome home.

138
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:35,400
Thank you.

139
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:39,313
Cheers, Karin. Cheers, Minus.

140
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:46,528
What about your book?

141
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,824
It'll be finished by then.

142
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:53,377
I spoke to the publishers.
I'll turn in the manuscript next week.

143
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:56,876
- Will you be away long?
- I'm not sure.

144
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:00,547
I may stay a while in Dubrovnik
after the others go home.

145
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:13,013
I feel like a criminal for some reason.

146
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:18,565
You promised to stay home
after Switzerland, didn't you?

147
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:22,903
I vaguely remember discussing it,
but as for promising...

148
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,608
Yes, Papa, you promised.

149
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,705
How unfortunate.

150
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,657
Yes, it is.

151
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:44,553
This was to be a nice evening,

152
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,506
and instead we're on the verge of tears.

153
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:52,724
I've got presents for you all
from Switzerland.

154
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,023
Karin.

155
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,193
And Martin.

156
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,737
Thanks. You shouldn't have.

157
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,904
Minus.

158
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:05,449
- Can we open them now?
- Yes, do.

159
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:13,074
Excuse me. I'm going to get my tobacco.

160
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:21,131
These won't even fit my thumbs.

161
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,958
I have one just like this.

162
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:27,387
I bet he didn't think of them
till he got to Stockholm.

163
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,884
It was a kind thought.

164
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:38,250
- Thank you so much, David.
- Thanks for the lovely gloves.

165
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,504
We've got a surprise for you too.

166
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:45,712
- We have to blindfold you.
- Don't peek.

167
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:48,215
I'll take care of this. You go ahead.

168
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,170
I can't see a thing.

169
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:58,771
It's like walking on clouds.
Whose idea was this?

170
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:00,097
Minus's.

171
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:01,853
Karin and I helped.

172
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,575
Wait and see.

173
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:16,072
This is almost like Shakespeare.

174
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,378
Are you ready?

175
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:35,800
Our play is called <i>The Artistic Haunting</i>

176
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:38,101
or <i>The Tomb of Illusions.</i>

177
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,728
Let the play begin.

178
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:44,938
It's midnight in Saint Teresa's Chapel.

179
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:48,361
Here I shall meet my heart's desire.

180
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:52,362
Here, by this tomb
redolent with the smell of death.

181
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:56,825
Someone moved inside. Could it be her?

182
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,372
I'll hide so as not to frighten her.

183
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:05,120
Who are you?

184
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,046
I am the princess of Castile

185
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,216
who died in childbirth in her 13th year.

186
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:14,763
My husband and beloved master,
who was my playmate as a child,

187
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:17,466
has turned to other women.

188
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,018
Princess, I love you.

189
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,766
Who are you?

190
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:25,645
I cannot speak to just anybody,
even though I am dead.

191
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:27,852
Fear not, fair lady.

192
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:32,531
I am ruler of my own kingdom,
small and poor though it may be.

193
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:33,824
I am an artist.

194
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,776
An artist?

195
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:39,159
Yes, Princess.
An artist of the purest kind.

196
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:42,332
A poet without poems,
a painter without paintings...

197
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:48,505
- Musician.
- A musician without notes.

198
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:53,552
I scorn ready-made art,
the banal result of vulgar effort.

199
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:57,507
My life is my work,
and it is dedicated to my love for you.

200
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,013
Beautiful words, but hard to believe.

201
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,310
I beg of you, put me to the test.

202
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:06,015
Listen carefully.
In a moment, I will leave you.

203
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:09,393
When the convent clock strikes 2:00,

204
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:14,403
you shall enter the tomb
and blow out the three candles inside.

205
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:18,573
At that instant,
the doors will close forever

206
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:21,155
and you shall join me in death.

207
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:23,741
An easy sacrifice, my princess.

208
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:26,872
For what is life to a true artist?

209
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:37,713
You thus perfect your work of art
and crown your love.

210
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:42,097
You ennoble your life
and show the skeptics

211
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,515
what a true artist can do.

212
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,515
Farewell, my friend.

213
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,983
Do not fail me.

214
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:58,032
I face the moment of ultimate perfection.

215
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:00,031
I tremble with anticipation.

216
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:03,659
Oblivion shall own me

217
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,583
and death alone shall love me.

218
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,287
I will go. Nothing can stop me.

219
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:13,127
I am waiting.

220
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:15,300
Ye devils, what am I about to do?

221
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:17,924
Sacrifice my life? For what?

222
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:19,596
For eternity?

223
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:22,800
For the perfect work of art? For love?

224
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:25,761
Have I gone mad?
- I am waiting.

225
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:28,347
Who shall see my sacrifice? Death.

226
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:31,900
Who shall gauge the depth of my love?
A ghost.

227
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:34,979
And who shall thank me? Eternity.

228
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,438
I am waiting.

229
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,826
My knees turn to clay,
my whole body trembles,

230
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:43,028
and my insides run like water.

231
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,159
I cannot enter eternity with...

232
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,081
I shall wait no longer.

233
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:54,290
Well... such is life.

234
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:59,010
I could, of course, write a poem
about my meeting with the princess.

235
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:01,588
Or paint a picture or compose an opera,

236
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:05,050
although it would need
a more heroic ending.

237
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:09,972
Oblivion shall own me...

238
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:14,359
and death alone shall love me.

239
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,357
Not bad.

240
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:22,318
The cock heralds the dawn.

241
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:26,867
I shall go home to bed.

242
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,539
That's all.

243
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:35,873
Author! Author!

244
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:38,584
You were fantastic.

245
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:43,638
And you were excellent.
- It was all Minus's doing.

246
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:46,467
- But I forgot my lines.
- I never noticed.

247
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:02,741
Let's clear the table and clean up.

248
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:05,069
No, I'll do it. It's too early for bed.

249
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,199
Not on your life.

250
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:10,908
I like puttering around.
You'd actually be doing me a service.

251
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:14,745
- Well, in that case...
- It's settled, then.

252
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:17,126
I'll get cracking right away.

253
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,590
Are you going to bed now?
- Yes.

254
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:22,127
There's hot water in the kitchen.

255
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,554
You were smart to think ahead.

256
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,099
- The thunderstorm has passed.
- I told you so.

257
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:31,599
We left the window open.
We'll have mosquitoes in the bedroom.

258
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:33,430
A few mosquitoes won't hurt you.

259
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:35,106
Good night, Papa.

260
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:36,808
Good night, Karin. Sleep well.

261
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,855
Good night, everybody.

262
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:43,364
- Can you manage?
- I'm fine.

263
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:45,408
- I'll help you.
- I'm fine.

264
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,493
Could you help me?

265
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:47,512
How black they get from your gardening.

266
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:49,840
It won't come off.

267
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:53,973
You have such kind fingers.

268
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:58,598
But your thumb looks rather stubborn.

269
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:04,067
- Are you sad, Karin?
- Not really.

270
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:06,564
What are you thinking about?

271
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,367
Sometimes we're so defenseless.

272
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,863
No, I don't know.

273
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:18,118
Like children cast out
into the wilderness at night.

274
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:22,547
The owls fly past,
watching you with their yellow eyes.

275
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:27,924
You hear the pitter-patter and rustling,
the soughing and sighing,

276
00:22:28,389 --> 00:22:30,881
all the damp noses sniffing at you.

277
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:34,885
The wolves bare their teeth.

278
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:37,437
Don't worry. You and I have each other.

279
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,940
You look worried.
I'm not so sure about that.

280
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,234
I'm not worried at all.

281
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:46,404
You say, "There are no wolves.

282
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,652
I see nothing, and there's no owl either.

283
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:52,736
I don't hear a sound,
and the wolf is only your imagination."

284
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,787
You have to trust me, Karin.

285
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:56,991
Little Kajsa.

286
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,667
"Little Kajsa."

287
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:01,915
You always say that.

288
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:08,510
Am I so little,
or has the illness made a child of me?

289
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:10,883
Do I seem strange to you?

290
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:18,266
- Do you think I speak the truth?
- I don't know.

291
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:24,442
- Don't you think I love you?
- Yes, I do.

292
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:27,271
Isn't that enough?

293
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:29,151
Of course it's enough.

294
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:32,780
Leave it, or you'll start bleeding.
- I'll be all right.

295
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:41,459
I have to do some washing tomorrow.

296
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:44,336
Come to bed, Karin.

297
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:47,791
Did you notice that Papa
took Minus's play as a personal affront?

298
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:51,169
He was terribly hurt
but tried not to let on.

299
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,848
And that upset Minus, of course.

300
00:24:05,736 --> 00:24:07,477
Shall we put out the light?

301
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:13,984
I'm sorry if I upset you.

302
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:15,569
Dearest child.

303
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:16,949
Forgive me.

304
00:24:17,498 --> 00:24:19,330
Dearest beloved.

305
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,327
My dear, dear girl.

306
00:24:24,338 --> 00:24:26,751
Sweetheart, I love you.

307
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:31,126
You couldn't upset me.

308
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:34,675
You're so kind, and I'm so horrid.

309
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:39,347
Good night.

310
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:19,985
"She came towards him,
panting with anticipation...

311
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:23,738
cheeks rosy from the blustering wind."

312
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:28,126
My God.

313
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:01,706
They met...

314
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:06,127
on the beach.

315
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:16,094
Hello, little Kajsa.

316
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:19,643
Are you up already?
It can't be later than 4:00.

317
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:23,230
- Hello, Papa.
- What is it?

318
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:26,358
Having trouble?

319
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:30,651
I'm adding the finishing
touches to my book,

320
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,981
which is never much fun.

321
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:35,822
- Read to me.
- Later, when I get the proofs.

322
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:39,534
How come you're not asleep?

323
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:42,617
Some birds made frightening noises
right at sunrise.

324
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:44,668
They woke me up,

325
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:46,871
and then I didn't dare go back to sleep.

326
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,257
Just a moment.

327
00:33:04,274 --> 00:33:06,140
Just like when I was little.

328
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:08,100
Now you'll sleep. You'll see.

329
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:31,131
"They met on the beach.

330
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:34,085
It was a clear day.

331
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:37,133
Autumn was in the air."

332
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:42,434
Karin just fell asleep.

333
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:47,060
Want to come and pull in the nets?

334
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,732
I'll be right there.

335
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:20,264
Last summer I was as good
at walking on my hands as on my feet.

336
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:22,933
Now I'm so tall, I've lost all balance.

337
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:24,601
Same here.

338
00:34:24,688 --> 00:34:26,771
You mean spiritually. I get it.

339
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:29,348
- Do you write these days?
- Plays.

340
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:31,525
- May I read some of it?
- No.

341
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:35,230
Sorry. Nothing personal,
but they're not very good.

342
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:36,939
Have you written a lot?

343
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:39,446
Thirteen plays and an opera this summer.

344
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:40,697
My goodness.

345
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:44,030
It comes gushing out of me.
Isn't it the same for you?

346
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:45,865
No.

347
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:49,707
What did you think of our play last night?
Honestly.

348
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:51,207
It was nice.

349
00:34:51,298 --> 00:34:53,039
I thought it was crap.

350
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:45,405
"Her illness is incurable...

351
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:49,789
with periods of temporary improvement.

352
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,372
I have long suspected it,

353
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:58,251
but the certainty is nevertheless
almost unbearable.

354
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:04,424
I'm horrified by my curiosity...

355
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:09,429
by my urge to record its course...

356
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:15,648
to make an accurate description
of her gradual disintegration...

357
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,859
to use her."

358
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:08,818
Martin, wake up.
How long are you going to sleep?

359
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:11,996
Time for a swim. Get up now.

360
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:15,449
- What time is it?
- Almost 10:00.

361
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:18,251
Heavens, have I slept that long?

362
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:26,169
- You little imp. It's only 5:00.
- So what?

363
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:29,630
I've been up for ages
and had all kinds of odd experiences,

364
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,511
while you just slept.

365
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:35,720
- Come over here.
- No, get up. We're going for a swim.

366
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:38,181
Papa and Minus are doing the nets.

367
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:39,560
Come here.

368
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:46,314
You sleep too much.

369
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,820
That's what makes you such a know-it-all.

370
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:58,909
My little one, what's wrong?

371
00:39:01,923 --> 00:39:03,459
Nothing.

372
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:06,342
What is it, Karin?

373
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:08,134
I have a confession.

374
00:39:08,221 --> 00:39:10,053
Out with it, then.

375
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:16,970
When Papa went out just now,
I rummaged through his desk.

376
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:21,437
I don't know why. I just felt I had to.

377
00:39:21,943 --> 00:39:23,024
And?

378
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:28,318
- I found his diary.
- And?

379
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:34,279
- He'd written things in it.
- Like what?

380
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:37,448
About me.

381
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:40,162
What had he written?

382
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:42,374
I can't tell you.

383
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:45,585
About your illness?

384
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,803
Is it true it's incurable?

385
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:54,257
Dearest Karin, listen to me.

386
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,885
Listen to me now.

387
00:39:57,979 --> 00:39:59,811
Look at me.

388
00:40:01,274 --> 00:40:05,439
I told David there's a chance
you'll have a relapse.

389
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:07,645
It's possible he misunderstood me.

390
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:11,232
No one can say your illness is incurable.

391
00:40:13,286 --> 00:40:14,652
Word of honor?

392
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:15,987
Word of honor.

393
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:19,869
There now.

394
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:23,202
There was more.

395
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:25,083
Well?

396
00:40:25,173 --> 00:40:26,584
I can't tell you.

397
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:29,257
- Please.
- I couldn't possibly.

398
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:32,715
Ask him yourself.

399
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:38,596
Karin, little Karin.

400
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,177
Martin?

401
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:45,686
You must be patient with me.

402
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:50,195
I'm sure my desire will come back.

403
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:53,277
Don't you think?
- Oh, yes.

404
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:56,406
- Does it worry you?
- Not in the least.

405
00:40:58,206 --> 00:41:01,040
Listen, I'm terribly tired...

406
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:05,203
but I still think we should go for a swim.

407
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:07,538
It's not cold at all.

408
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:22,060
Imagine having a stable wife
who gave you children and coffee in bed...

409
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:26,565
who was big and soft
and warm and beautiful.

410
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,727
Wouldn't that be nice after all?

411
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:34,573
- It's you I love.
- Of course, but all the same...

412
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:36,867
I don't want anyone else.

413
00:41:44,544 --> 00:41:48,914
It's funny. Even though you always
say and do the right thing,

414
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:50,498
it turns out wrong.

415
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:55,256
If I do, it's out of love.

416
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:59,010
He that loves for real
always does right by his loved one.

417
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,592
In that case, you don't love me.

418
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,611
Bye, Minus.

419
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:15,314
Bye.

420
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:36,127
Make sure poor Minus
doesn't fall asleep over his Latin.

421
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:39,759
- I said I'd test him on his grammar.
- Bye, my girl.

422
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:44,639
Don't forget your brandy,
and get a bottle of white wine.

423
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:45,810
My very thought.

424
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:48,480
- Bye, darling.
- We'll be back for dinner.

425
00:43:29,649 --> 00:43:31,481
What the hell are you laughing at?

426
00:43:34,654 --> 00:43:35,770
Eh?

427
00:43:38,241 --> 00:43:39,698
Say something.

428
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:44,445
Have a look, if it's so amusing.

429
00:43:45,498 --> 00:43:47,615
Which are your favorites?

430
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:51,290
Don't be such an old maid.
Come and show me.

431
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:59,919
You like her best? Why?

432
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:01,548
She's so soft.

433
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:04,723
I think she's pretty too.
But isn't she a bit fat?

434
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:09,144
- And her hair is so long...
- She doesn't look too deep.

435
00:44:11,816 --> 00:44:14,604
But it doesn't help me a damn bit.

436
00:44:21,284 --> 00:44:23,321
Are you going to hit me?

437
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:30,995
It was my fault. Forgive me.

438
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:33,584
Easy now, Minus.

439
00:44:34,422 --> 00:44:36,835
It doesn't matter. Don't worry.

440
00:44:39,177 --> 00:44:41,294
I was silly and curious. Forgive me.

441
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:45,681
I don't mean to. It just happens.

442
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:53,931
- Did you study?
- More or less.

443
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:56,517
- Shall I test you?
- If you'd like.

444
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:02,690
- I wonder if everyone is caged in.
- What?

445
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:04,900
You in your cage, I in mine.

446
00:45:04,994 --> 00:45:08,328
Each in his own little cube. Everybody.

447
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:10,655
I don't feel caged in at all.

448
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:13,333
Then I'm wrong, as usual.

449
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:16,628
<i>Constructio ad sensum.</i>
What does that mean?

450
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:17,921
Oh, no, you don't.

451
00:45:18,007 --> 00:45:21,421
It means that
a grammatically correct construction

452
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:24,218
is changed to suit the context.

453
00:45:24,764 --> 00:45:26,630
For example?

454
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:31,094
<i>Nobilitas rem publicam deseru...</i>

455
00:45:31,187 --> 00:45:32,894
<i>Deseruerant.</i>

456
00:45:34,315 --> 00:45:35,977
It's so hot.

457
00:45:36,067 --> 00:45:37,808
And I've been up since 4:30.

458
00:45:37,902 --> 00:45:40,269
Let's have a cigarette. Got any?

459
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:52,163
If you look long enough
with your head tilted to one side,

460
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:53,957
it gives you the creeps.

461
00:45:54,043 --> 00:45:55,784
The creeps?

462
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:59,754
Though it's fascinating.

463
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:03,754
I don't talk to Papa or Martin about it.
They don't understand.

464
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:08,596
Particularly not Martin. He's too anxious
and has enough worries as it is.

465
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:14,887
They don't understand.
They just think I'm sick.

466
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,807
Do you think so too?
- No.

467
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,777
I knew you didn't.

468
00:46:27,827 --> 00:46:29,284
You're stronger.

469
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:34,080
I've so often wanted to talk to you
about it all. It's like a...

470
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:36,032
You can trust me.

471
00:46:37,545 --> 00:46:41,004
It's hard not to talk about something
that's constantly on your mind.

472
00:46:41,966 --> 00:46:44,879
But I don't think the others
would mind my telling you.

473
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:46,380
The others?

474
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:50,054
Don't fluster me
with a lot of stupid questions.

475
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:53,009
Either I tell you all I dare,
or it's over.

476
00:46:53,102 --> 00:46:55,810
- I'm curious.
- That's fine for you.

477
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:06,146
Let me show you something.

478
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:50,778
I walk through the wall, you see.

479
00:47:51,744 --> 00:47:55,863
Early in the morning, I'm woken
by someone calling me in a firm voice.

480
00:47:57,917 --> 00:48:00,455
I rise and come to this room.

481
00:48:01,337 --> 00:48:04,876
One day, someone called me
from behind the wallpaper.

482
00:48:08,511 --> 00:48:12,551
I looked in the closet,
but there was no one there.

483
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,808
But the voice kept calling me,

484
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:21,855
so I pressed myself against the wall,
and it gave way, like foliage...

485
00:48:23,109 --> 00:48:24,645
and I was inside.

486
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:31,151
You think I'm making it up?

487
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:39,868
I enter a large room.

488
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:43,960
It's bright and peaceful.

489
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:48,711
People are moving back and forth.

490
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:53,011
Some of them talk to me,
and I understand them.

491
00:48:55,391 --> 00:48:58,099
It's so nice, and I feel safe.

492
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:04,227
In some of their faces,
there's a shining light.

493
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,852
Everyone is waiting for <i>him</i> to come,

494
00:49:09,572 --> 00:49:11,438
but no one is anxious.

495
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:16,989
They say that I can be there
when it happens.

496
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:21,823
Why are you crying?

497
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:24,455
It's nothing.

498
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:28,163
Nothing to worry about.

499
00:49:31,719 --> 00:49:36,009
But... sometimes I have
this intense yearning.

500
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,926
I long for that moment...

501
00:49:42,605 --> 00:49:44,597
when the door will open...

502
00:49:45,608 --> 00:49:49,147
and all the faces will turn to him.

503
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,436
Who is coming?

504
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:59,077
No one has said for certain.

505
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:06,126
But I think it's God
who will reveal himself to us.

506
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:11,836
That it will be him coming into the room

507
00:50:11,926 --> 00:50:13,758
through that door.

508
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:25,021
Minus.

509
00:50:28,651 --> 00:50:31,394
I have something difficult to tell you.

510
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:34,479
- What's that?
- I turn away from Martin.

511
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:38,525
He stands there calling me,
but I can't help him.

512
00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:40,451
It all becomes like a game.

513
00:50:41,497 --> 00:50:44,535
- Does he notice anything?
- I'm not sure.

514
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:47,625
I must choose between him and the others.

515
00:50:48,504 --> 00:50:50,040
I've made up my mind.

516
00:50:50,673 --> 00:50:52,881
I've sacrificed Martin.

517
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:56,042
Is all this for real?

518
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:58,378
I don't know.

519
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:01,719
I'm caught in the middle,
and sometimes I'm uncertain.

520
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:06,265
I know I've been ill
and that my illness was like a dream.

521
00:51:06,355 --> 00:51:08,142
But these are no dreams.

522
00:51:08,232 --> 00:51:11,066
They must be real. They must be real.

523
00:51:11,944 --> 00:51:15,153
They're not real for me, not in the least.

524
00:51:17,408 --> 00:51:18,819
Karin.

525
00:51:19,702 --> 00:51:22,570
They're not real for me.
- Oh, yes.

526
00:51:28,252 --> 00:51:30,539
A god steps down from the mountain.

527
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:35,044
He walks through the dark forest.

528
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:40,299
There are wild beasts everywhere
in the silent darkness.

529
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:46,142
It must be real.

530
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:50,305
I'm not dreaming. I'm telling the truth.

531
00:51:51,025 --> 00:51:54,018
Now I'm in one world, now in the other.

532
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:56,769
I can't stop it.

533
00:52:08,292 --> 00:52:10,204
Shall we go for a swim?

534
00:52:13,631 --> 00:52:15,543
I'll go alone, then.

535
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:19,130
I'm sleepy.

536
00:52:20,429 --> 00:52:22,512
I'm going to sleep a bit.

537
00:52:23,641 --> 00:52:25,758
Close the door when you leave.

538
00:52:35,694 --> 00:52:39,028
Stop that. Get out.

539
00:52:53,379 --> 00:52:55,541
What the hell am I to do?

540
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:10,768
Well, have you prepared your Latin?

541
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:15,185
Let's continue.

542
00:53:16,819 --> 00:53:19,106
But first we'll have some tea.

543
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:22,321
Minus.

544
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:26,443
Will you tell Papa and Martin?

545
00:53:26,537 --> 00:53:28,620
Tell them what?

546
00:53:28,706 --> 00:53:31,119
Clever answer, but you don't fool me.

547
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:34,083
Tonight you'll take Martin aside and say,

548
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:38,129
"I have to talk to you about Karin."
And then you'll tell him everything.

549
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:41,799
- Can't you tell him?
- Promise not to say anything.

550
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:43,501
I promise.

551
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:45,632
You're the only one who understands.

552
00:53:45,723 --> 00:53:48,966
Say one word and you've betrayed me.

553
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:50,721
I promise.

554
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,732
- It looks like rain.
- Do you think so?

555
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:09,153
- What's with you?
- What do you mean?

556
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:11,329
You're so quiet, almost hostile.

557
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:14,950
- It's not worth talking about.
- Please.

558
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:17,835
It's about Karin.

559
00:54:19,757 --> 00:54:22,921
She rummaged through your desk
and found your diary.

560
00:54:23,844 --> 00:54:25,801
And she read it, of course.

561
00:54:26,764 --> 00:54:28,255
Oh, no.

562
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:33,134
What did you write?

563
00:54:35,189 --> 00:54:37,272
Karin wanted me to ask you.

564
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:44,149
I wrote that her illness is incurable...

565
00:54:45,324 --> 00:54:49,443
that I felt a horrible urge
to record its course.

566
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:51,986
There's no one else to blame.

567
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:54,572
I've no excuse.

568
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:59,707
It's always about you and yours.

569
00:55:02,049 --> 00:55:05,292
Your callousness is perverse.

570
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:08,253
"Record its course." That's so typical.

571
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:13,007
You don't understand.

572
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:15,434
No, I don't.

573
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:17,728
But one thing I do understand.

574
00:55:17,815 --> 00:55:20,057
You're always on the hunt for subjects.

575
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:22,016
Your daughter's insanity.

576
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:24,318
What a great idea.

577
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,731
I love her, Martin.

578
00:55:27,825 --> 00:55:31,535
Love her? You're void of all feeling.

579
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:33,612
You lack common decency.

580
00:55:34,665 --> 00:55:38,830
You know how to express yourself.
You always have just the right words.

581
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:43,083
There's just one thing you haven't
the slightest clue about...

582
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:44,664
life itself.

583
00:55:45,259 --> 00:55:47,592
You're a craven coward,

584
00:55:48,095 --> 00:55:52,510
but a genius at evasions and excuses.

585
00:55:54,643 --> 00:55:56,384
What do you want me to do?

586
00:55:56,478 --> 00:55:57,844
Write your book.

587
00:55:59,106 --> 00:56:01,564
Maybe it will give you
your heart's desire...

588
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:03,482
your big breakthrough as a writer.

589
00:56:04,111 --> 00:56:08,025
Then you won't have sacrificed
your daughter in vain, and...

590
00:56:09,867 --> 00:56:11,859
Go ahead, say it.

591
00:56:20,544 --> 00:56:23,287
In your novels,
you're always courting some god.

592
00:56:23,964 --> 00:56:25,626
But let me tell you,

593
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:29,050
your faith and your doubt
are very unconvincing.

594
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:33,179
All that's apparent is your ingenuity.

595
00:56:33,974 --> 00:56:36,307
Don't you think I know that?

596
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:37,929
Then why go on?

597
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:40,353
Why not do something respectable instead?

598
00:56:40,439 --> 00:56:41,725
Such as?

599
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:47,269
Have you written one word of truth
in your life as an author?

600
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:49,479
- I don't know.
- See?

601
00:56:50,032 --> 00:56:54,527
Your half-lies are so refined
that they look like truth.

602
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:57,203
- I do my best.
- Maybe you do.

603
00:56:57,789 --> 00:56:59,906
But you fall short.

604
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:03,246
I know.

605
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:07,918
You're empty but clever.

606
00:57:08,926 --> 00:57:12,545
Now you're trying to fill your void
with Karin's extinction.

607
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:17,549
But I don't see
how you'll bring God into that.

608
00:57:17,643 --> 00:57:19,885
It'll make him more inscrutable than ever.

609
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:22,265
- Can I ask you something?
- Of course.

610
00:57:22,356 --> 00:57:25,099
Can you always control
your innermost thoughts?

611
00:57:25,192 --> 00:57:28,560
Fortunately I'm not very complex.

612
00:57:29,029 --> 00:57:33,399
My world is very simple.
Quite clear and human.

613
00:57:33,492 --> 00:57:35,199
Still you've wished Karin would die?

614
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:37,743
Absolutely not.

615
00:57:39,331 --> 00:57:41,197
Only you could think such a thing.

616
00:57:42,042 --> 00:57:44,375
Can you swear you've never thought of it?

617
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:46,744
It would be logical.

618
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:49,080
You know that her case is hopeless

619
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:52,633
and that both your suffering is pointless.

620
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,382
She might as well be dead.

621
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:56,804
You are grotesque.

622
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:58,802
That depends entirely
on your point of view.

623
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,511
I love her.

624
00:58:04,856 --> 00:58:06,597
I'm powerless.

625
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:09,896
I can only stand by and watch...

626
00:58:10,946 --> 00:58:14,860
as she is transformed
into a poor, tormented animal.

627
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:20,073
Let me tell you something.

628
00:58:23,959 --> 00:58:26,667
When I was in Switzerland,
I decided to kill myself.

629
00:58:27,713 --> 00:58:31,127
I hired a car and found a cliff.

630
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:34,376
I set out calmly.

631
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:37,007
It was afternoon.
The valley was already in darkness.

632
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:42,975
I was empty.
No fear, no regrets, no expectations.

633
00:58:44,563 --> 00:58:47,351
I aimed the car at the cliff,
stepped on the gas...

634
00:58:47,441 --> 00:58:49,933
and stalled, stopping dead.

635
00:58:50,027 --> 00:58:51,859
The transmission went out, you see.

636
00:58:52,863 --> 00:58:55,822
The car slid on the gravel
and came to a halt,

637
00:58:55,907 --> 00:58:58,320
front wheels over the edge.

638
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:01,653
I crawled out of the car, trembling.

639
00:59:03,582 --> 00:59:06,245
I leaned against a rock across the road.

640
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:09,960
I sat gasping for breath for hours.

641
00:59:12,758 --> 00:59:14,294
Why are you telling me this?

642
00:59:16,344 --> 00:59:20,179
To tell you
I no longer have any pretense to keep up.

643
00:59:20,932 --> 00:59:23,766
The truth won't bring catastrophe.

644
00:59:24,269 --> 00:59:26,135
This has nothing to do with Karin.

645
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:27,970
I think it does.

646
00:59:29,107 --> 00:59:30,348
I don't understand.

647
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:33,017
From the void within me,

648
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:36,400
something was born
that I can't touch or name.

649
00:59:39,743 --> 00:59:41,609
A love.

650
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:44,658
For Karin and Minus.

651
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:48,123
And you.

652
00:59:51,088 --> 00:59:53,296
One day, I may tell you about it.

653
00:59:54,174 --> 00:59:56,131
I dare not do it now.

654
00:59:56,218 --> 00:59:57,709
But if...

655
00:59:58,261 --> 01:00:00,924
But if it's the way I'm hoping...

656
01:00:05,894 --> 01:00:07,977
Let's leave it for now.

657
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:29,661
The rain is coming.

658
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:33,710
No.

659
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:37,749
Yes.

660
01:00:39,386 --> 01:00:40,843
The rain is coming.

661
01:03:10,078 --> 01:03:11,694
Karin, is that you?

662
01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:34,842
It's me, Karin.

663
01:04:22,067 --> 01:04:24,684
Can't you hear me, Karin?

664
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:28,312
I'm not well.

665
01:04:28,406 --> 01:04:29,613
Let's go home.

666
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:32,692
- You have to help me.
- How can I help you?

667
01:04:35,413 --> 01:04:37,405
You have to help me.

668
01:04:43,254 --> 01:04:45,086
I'm so thirsty.

669
01:04:45,173 --> 01:04:46,505
I'll get some water.

670
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:47,019
God.

671
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:54,981
What time is it?

672
01:07:57,699 --> 01:07:59,031
5:00, I think.

673
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:03,072
I've been very sick,

674
01:08:03,705 --> 01:08:05,742
but I feel better now.

675
01:08:05,832 --> 01:08:06,913
Poor Minus.

676
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,957
Karin, my darling.

677
01:08:09,043 --> 01:08:12,081
- I want to talk to Papa alone.
- Let's go home.

678
01:08:12,171 --> 01:08:14,754
I must talk to Papa
before it starts again.

679
01:08:14,841 --> 01:08:17,675
- Karin, dear.
- Please.

680
01:08:27,061 --> 01:08:29,348
I'll go and call an ambulance.

681
01:08:38,239 --> 01:08:40,606
Please go and get my medicine bag.

682
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:43,443
I'll have to give her a shot.

683
01:08:54,839 --> 01:08:59,425
I want to stay at the hospital now.
I don't want any more treatments.

684
01:09:01,304 --> 01:09:03,762
Can you tell them no more of those?

685
01:09:03,848 --> 01:09:05,339
I don't know.

686
01:09:06,267 --> 01:09:09,977
I can't live in two worlds.
I have to choose.

687
01:09:11,397 --> 01:09:14,356
I can't keep going back and forth
between one and the other.

688
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:29,196
It can't go on.

689
01:09:29,791 --> 01:09:31,032
What?

690
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:33,576
The hatred.

691
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:35,206
What hatred?

692
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:45,137
I didn't do it of my own free will.

693
01:09:46,766 --> 01:09:49,975
A voice told me what to do.

694
01:09:52,230 --> 01:09:54,768
The voice told you to read my diary.

695
01:09:56,818 --> 01:09:59,982
It also told you
to tell Martin what you read.

696
01:10:06,494 --> 01:10:08,486
I've done worse than that.

697
01:10:13,292 --> 01:10:14,703
Much worse.

698
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:24,715
I tried to resist,
but I couldn't get away.

699
01:10:27,765 --> 01:10:29,631
I was forced to do it.

700
01:10:31,936 --> 01:10:33,472
When was this?

701
01:10:35,606 --> 01:10:37,188
Just now.

702
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:42,269
Poor little Minus.

703
01:10:46,826 --> 01:10:49,489
I just don't understand!

704
01:10:50,163 --> 01:10:52,155
Try to stay calm, Karin.

705
01:10:57,211 --> 01:10:59,749
And then the room with the people waiting.

706
01:11:03,885 --> 01:11:07,049
Those good, bright-faced people
waiting for the door to open...

707
01:11:08,389 --> 01:11:10,551
for God to come to them.

708
01:11:12,977 --> 01:11:14,593
Then the voices start...

709
01:11:15,855 --> 01:11:19,565
and I have to do as they say.

710
01:11:21,319 --> 01:11:23,811
I can't make sense of it all.

711
01:11:24,655 --> 01:11:26,863
Is it really just my illness?

712
01:11:31,078 --> 01:11:35,038
It's so horrible to see your own confusion
and understand it.

713
01:11:51,933 --> 01:11:54,050
I want to apologize to you.

714
01:11:56,979 --> 01:12:00,347
I've always had a guilty conscience
about you, so I turned away.

715
01:12:03,861 --> 01:12:07,696
It makes me sick to think of the life
I sacrificed to my so-called art.

716
01:12:09,617 --> 01:12:12,155
I first became successful
around the time your mother died.

717
01:12:12,245 --> 01:12:14,328
It meant more to me than her death.

718
01:12:15,248 --> 01:12:19,333
I was secretly rejoicing, yet I loved
your mother in my own confused way.

719
01:12:20,378 --> 01:12:23,121
When I fell ill, you went to Switzerland.

720
01:12:23,214 --> 01:12:27,424
I couldn't bear that you had inherited
your mother's illness, so I fled.

721
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:29,593
I had to finish my novel.

722
01:12:30,471 --> 01:12:32,337
Is it any good?

723
01:12:38,312 --> 01:12:39,974
You see, Karin...

724
01:12:41,482 --> 01:12:43,849
one draws a magic circle around oneself

725
01:12:44,527 --> 01:12:48,692
to keep everything out
that doesn't fit one's secret games.

726
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:52,737
Each time life breaks through the circle,

727
01:12:52,827 --> 01:12:55,069
the games become puny and ridiculous.

728
01:12:56,914 --> 01:13:00,373
So one draws a new circle
and builds new defenses.

729
01:13:04,755 --> 01:13:05,996
Poor little Papa.

730
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:10,255
Yes, poor little Papa,
forced to live in reality.

731
01:13:27,778 --> 01:13:29,394
Let's go home now.

732
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:32,147
I have to pack.

733
01:13:46,589 --> 01:13:49,798
- When will the ambulance be here?
- About an hour.

734
01:13:52,053 --> 01:13:54,215
I just want to get changed and pack.

735
01:14:01,854 --> 01:14:03,561
Thanks. I can manage.

736
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:12,191
The light is so strong.

737
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:25,621
You must help Minus with his Latin, Papa.

738
01:14:25,711 --> 01:14:26,711
I already thought of it.

739
01:14:29,215 --> 01:14:31,252
We mustn't forget
the keys to our place in town.

740
01:14:31,342 --> 01:14:32,878
The doorman's on vacation.

741
01:14:32,969 --> 01:14:36,462
- Aren't you coming back here?
- No, I'll stay in town.

742
01:14:37,556 --> 01:14:39,013
I think that's best.

743
01:14:41,936 --> 01:14:44,349
We didn't get to pick any mushrooms.

744
01:14:46,899 --> 01:14:50,313
Will you help me pack, Martin?
- Of course.

745
01:14:56,617 --> 01:14:58,233
I want to talk to you.

746
01:15:00,871 --> 01:15:01,952
Come here now, Minus.

747
01:15:18,014 --> 01:15:20,427
Your shirts are washed but not ironed.

748
01:15:23,978 --> 01:15:26,937
I'll wear this.
I've got shirts in town anyway.

749
01:15:27,023 --> 01:15:28,935
Can you help me close this, please?

750
01:15:39,702 --> 01:15:43,195
It's the shoes. I'll leave them here.

751
01:15:43,289 --> 01:15:46,032
Wear these instead and leave those.

752
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:48,537
I'm taking them to the shoemaker's.

753
01:15:51,630 --> 01:15:53,462
Have you got something for a headache?

754
01:15:55,217 --> 01:15:59,131
- I thought I put my bag in here.
- No, it's in the kitchen.

755
01:15:59,722 --> 01:16:01,304
So it is.

756
01:16:54,777 --> 01:16:56,643
Have you seen Karin?

757
01:16:58,948 --> 01:16:59,948
No.

758
01:17:15,548 --> 01:17:18,336
I came as quickly as I could,
but it wasn't easy.

759
01:17:20,094 --> 01:17:23,633
There are many who would stop me.

760
01:17:26,392 --> 01:17:28,133
I'm so happy.

761
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:35,686
Yes, I understand.

762
01:17:40,072 --> 01:17:41,938
I understand.

763
01:17:44,034 --> 01:17:45,150
Yes.

764
01:17:45,953 --> 01:17:47,239
That's good.

765
01:17:48,664 --> 01:17:50,326
Yes, I understand.

766
01:17:54,336 --> 01:17:56,043
Yes, I understand.

767
01:17:57,173 --> 01:17:59,335
I know it won't be long now.

768
01:18:02,636 --> 01:18:04,798
It's a great comfort to know that.

769
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:09,007
But our waiting has been a time of joy.

770
01:18:11,145 --> 01:18:13,353
Martin, walk quietly.

771
01:18:13,856 --> 01:18:16,269
They say he'll be here any moment now.

772
01:18:16,358 --> 01:18:18,600
We must be ready.

773
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:20,606
We're going to town.

774
01:18:20,696 --> 01:18:22,528
I can't go now. Don't you see?

775
01:18:22,615 --> 01:18:24,948
You're mistaken, Karin.

776
01:18:27,286 --> 01:18:29,573
Nothing is happening in there.

777
01:18:33,334 --> 01:18:36,122
No god is going to walk through that door.

778
01:18:36,212 --> 01:18:40,627
He'll be here any moment now,
and I must be here.

779
01:18:40,716 --> 01:18:43,333
Dearest Karin, it's not true.

780
01:18:43,844 --> 01:18:47,337
If you can't be quiet, you'd best leave.

781
01:18:47,431 --> 01:18:49,093
Come now.

782
01:18:49,183 --> 01:18:51,015
Why must you spoil it?

783
01:18:51,101 --> 01:18:53,718
Go away and let me have this moment alone.

784
01:19:25,427 --> 01:19:27,168
Dearest Martin...

785
01:19:28,514 --> 01:19:30,756
I'm sorry I was so mean just now.

786
01:19:32,977 --> 01:19:37,517
Couldn't you kneel down next to me
and put your hands together?

787
01:19:39,066 --> 01:19:42,650
You look so funny
and conspicuous sitting there.

788
01:19:44,571 --> 01:19:46,688
I know you don't believe...

789
01:19:47,908 --> 01:19:49,945
but for my sake, Martin.

790
01:20:00,921 --> 01:20:02,457
My love.

791
01:20:04,133 --> 01:20:05,795
My love.

792
01:21:25,047 --> 01:21:26,709
Hold her legs.

793
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:48,692
Calm down, Karin.

794
01:22:30,863 --> 01:22:32,479
I was frightened.

795
01:22:35,784 --> 01:22:37,571
The door opened.

796
01:22:39,580 --> 01:22:42,493
But the god that came out was a spider.

797
01:22:46,753 --> 01:22:48,665
He came towards me...

798
01:22:49,798 --> 01:22:51,835
and I saw his face.

799
01:22:53,218 --> 01:22:55,961
It was a terrible, stony face.

800
01:22:59,975 --> 01:23:02,843
He crawled up
and tried to force himself into me,

801
01:23:03,353 --> 01:23:05,219
but I defended myself.

802
01:23:07,524 --> 01:23:10,187
The whole time, I saw his eyes.

803
01:23:11,695 --> 01:23:14,312
They were cold and calm.

804
01:23:16,492 --> 01:23:18,825
When he couldn't penetrate me...

805
01:23:20,787 --> 01:23:23,029
he continued up my chest...

806
01:23:25,209 --> 01:23:28,498
up onto my face and on up the wall.

807
01:23:37,930 --> 01:23:40,422
I have seen God.

808
01:24:01,912 --> 01:24:04,746
Wait by the jetty.
We'll be there as soon as we can.

809
01:24:12,506 --> 01:24:14,213
They'll be waiting by the jetty.

810
01:27:30,954 --> 01:27:32,240
I'm scared, Papa.

811
01:27:34,833 --> 01:27:37,871
When I sat holding Karin
down in the wreck,

812
01:27:37,961 --> 01:27:39,702
reality burst open.

813
01:27:39,796 --> 01:27:41,958
Do you understand what I mean?

814
01:27:42,048 --> 01:27:43,209
Yes, I understand.

815
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:45,417
Reality burst open,

816
01:27:46,136 --> 01:27:47,343
and I tumbled out.

817
01:27:48,138 --> 01:27:50,380
It's like in a dream.

818
01:27:50,474 --> 01:27:52,306
Anything can happen.

819
01:27:52,976 --> 01:27:54,342
Anything.

820
01:27:55,771 --> 01:27:57,433
I know.

821
01:27:58,315 --> 01:28:00,227
I can't live in this new world.

822
01:28:00,317 --> 01:28:02,149
Yes, you can,

823
01:28:02,235 --> 01:28:04,602
but you must have something to hold onto.

824
01:28:04,696 --> 01:28:06,779
What would that be?

825
01:28:06,865 --> 01:28:08,072
A god?

826
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:12,197
Give me some proof of God.

827
01:28:14,748 --> 01:28:16,865
You can't.
- Yes, I can.

828
01:28:16,958 --> 01:28:19,496
But you have to listen carefully.

829
01:28:20,504 --> 01:28:23,338
Yes, I need to listen.

830
01:28:23,924 --> 01:28:27,338
I can only give you a hint of my own hope.

831
01:28:28,053 --> 01:28:32,593
It's knowing that love exists for real
in the human world.

832
01:28:32,682 --> 01:28:35,846
- A special kind of love, I suppose?
- All kinds, Minus.

833
01:28:35,936 --> 01:28:39,805
The highest and the lowest,
the most absurd and the most sublime.

834
01:28:40,899 --> 01:28:42,811
All kinds of love.

835
01:28:42,901 --> 01:28:45,109
The longing for love?

836
01:28:45,195 --> 01:28:47,107
Longing and denial.

837
01:28:47,197 --> 01:28:49,189
Trust and distrust.

838
01:28:50,492 --> 01:28:53,860
So love is the proof?

839
01:28:55,205 --> 01:28:58,369
I don't know if love
is proof of God's existence

840
01:28:58,458 --> 01:29:00,575
or if love is God himself.

841
01:29:01,962 --> 01:29:05,626
For you, love and God are the same.

842
01:29:06,633 --> 01:29:10,718
That thought helps me
in my emptiness and my dirty despair.

843
01:29:12,389 --> 01:29:14,176
Tell me more, Papa.

844
01:29:14,933 --> 01:29:17,971
Suddenly the emptiness
turns into abundance,

845
01:29:18,061 --> 01:29:19,802
and despair into life.

846
01:29:20,605 --> 01:29:22,767
It's like a reprieve, Minus...

847
01:29:24,109 --> 01:29:26,101
from a death sentence.

848
01:29:27,362 --> 01:29:30,480
Papa, if it is as you say,

849
01:29:30,574 --> 01:29:34,739
then Karin is surrounded by God,
since we love her.

850
01:29:35,203 --> 01:29:36,203
Yes.

851
01:29:36,246 --> 01:29:37,908
Can that help her?

852
01:29:40,917 --> 01:29:42,533
I believe so.

853
01:29:47,424 --> 01:29:49,256
Would you mind if I go for a run?

854
01:29:49,342 --> 01:29:52,085
Off you go. I'll make dinner.

855
01:29:52,178 --> 01:29:53,589
See you in an hour.

856
01:30:01,688 --> 01:30:03,850
Papa spoke to me.
