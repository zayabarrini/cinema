THE VIRGIN SPRING

2
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:53,669
Adapted from a 13th-century Ballad by
ULLA ISAKSSON

3
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:12,612
Cinematography by
SVEN NYKVIST

4
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:37,007
Directed by
INGMAR BERGMAN

5
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,117
Odin, come!

6
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,962
Odin, come!

7
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,980
Come to my aid.

8
00:03:57,404 --> 00:04:02,240
<i>Heavenly Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
with all your hosts of angels,</i>

9
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:06,403
guard us this day and always
from the devil's snares.

10
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:09,285
Lord, let not temptation, shame...

11
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,459
nor danger befall
thy servants this day.

12
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:26,256
It's Friday,
the day of our Lord's agony.

13
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:50,780
So help me God,

14
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:54,576
I nearly stepped on them
out there in the dark.

15
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:59,205
You poor thing...

16
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,167
live out your wretched little life,

17
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:05,466
the way God allows all of us to live.

18
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,977
Where were you all night?

19
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:25,318
If you don't care where you sleep,

20
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:27,825
you could at least
come back for the milking.

21
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,782
I had to run around
on these poor legs.

22
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:35,583
Jesus and Mary, you're a sight!
What's wrong?

23
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,378
What's wrong?
Nothing more than the usual...

24
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:41,665
that bastards beget bastards.

25
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:45,256
Serves you right,
the way you behave,

26
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:48,921
spitting and snarling
like a wildcat.

27
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:52,178
You should thank God
on your bare knees for his mercy.

28
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:55,186
To come to a farm like this
and stay in this house

29
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,846
like a child of the family.

30
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,481
But you are, and always will be,
a savage child.

31
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,192
The milk is still on the porch!

32
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:45,986
You'll have to ride to church
with the candles for the Virgin.

33
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,231
- Me?
- Yes.

34
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,239
- Isn't Karin to take them?
- Karin's not well today.

35
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:56,201
She'll sleep through morning mass
and then feel just fine.

36
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:59,583
I think she has a fever.
Her skin was so warm.

37
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,412
She certainly burned with fever
at the dance last night.

38
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,421
Watch your tongue!

39
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:07,917
I'm not afraid my daughter
will walk in your filthy footsteps.

40
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:11,762
You two have always been
as different as rose and thorn.

41
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:14,015
You've always pricked others
and made them suffer!

42
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:15,800
You can't help yourself.

43
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:18,515
We should throw you out, after
the mess you've gotten yourself into.

44
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:17,411
Lord, bless this,
our daily bread. Amen.

45
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,584
Where's Karin?

46
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:27,672
Shouldn't she be leaving
for church with the candles?

47
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,833
Karin's not feeling well today.

48
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:34,838
She didn't seem sick last night.
She's fond of sleeping away the morning.

49
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:37,348
Nevertheless, she's sick now.

50
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:41,136
She can't suddenly be so sick
that she can't ride to church.

51
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:43,725
Frida will have to take the candles.

52
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:47,817
You know tradition says
a virgin must take the candles.

53
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,027
You're always so concerned
with discipline and duty

54
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,858
when it comes to Karin.

55
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:55,654
And you're always so soft and weak
when it comes to her.

56
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,704
She's the only child I have left.

57
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:03,457
All the more reason
to raise her properly.

58
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:07,370
I had bad dreams last night.

59
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:15,135
You shouldn't practice
such harsh penance at night.

60
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:20,057
Now send Ingeri to wake Karin.

61
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,888
I'll go myself.

62
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:29,066
Yes, go and put some life
into that loafer.

63
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,936
Ingeri will have to prepare
a lunch for her.

64
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:35,072
Put some cheese
in the wheat cakes.

65
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,073
And some mutton too.

66
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:50,871
Are you sick, Karin?

67
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,706
No, not sick.

68
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:54,913
Just sleepy.

69
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:59,216
Can't I have
breakfast in bed today?

70
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:03,842
Father says you're to get up at once
and take the candles to church.

71
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:05,847
No.

72
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:09,343
If you're not well enough,
Frida has to go.

73
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:12,597
- I'm not sick.
- Then you have to go.

74
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,061
Then I want to wear
the yellow shift.

75
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:17,522
My child,
it's the middle of the week.

76
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,065
Then I won't go.

77
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:23,490
You're behaving like a little child.

78
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:32,746
If I'd used that tone of voice
with my parents at your age,

79
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:35,707
I'd have gotten a good thrashing
and nothing to eat.

80
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:38,923
Then give me a thrashing
and nothing to eat.

81
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:42,423
Give me berries with my bread
instead of butter.

82
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:47,265
You know very well I can't be
hard on you, though I ought to be.

83
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,220
You laugh...

84
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,176
but Father's angry...

85
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:53,687
and one day
you'll bring shame down upon me.

86
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:55,772
Get out my yellow silk shift,

87
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:58,275
and my Sunday skirt
and blue cape.

88
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,901
Then I'll be happy,

89
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:03,064
and you'll be happy,
and Father as well.

90
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:07,235
Mother, I'll ride to church
with such dignity,

91
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:10,120
and Blackie will raise
his hooves gently,

92
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:12,615
like in a pilgrim's procession.

93
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:17,461
I'll look neither right nor left
but straight ahead,

94
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:22,132
thinking of the candles
and of God's holy mother.

95
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:30,974
The white stockings too,

96
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:34,269
and the blue shoes
with the pearls.

97
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:57,331
This is certainly no everyday shift!

98
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:02,332
Fifteen maidens sewed this.

99
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:12,433
Calm down!

100
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:19,890
Was it really 15,
all at one time?

101
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:21,688
Yes.

102
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:29,859
Come sit down
and I'll comb your hair.

103
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,808
No, I'll wear my hair down,

104
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,310
since I have these fine clothes on.

105
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:02,357
If you always get your way,
you'll give the devil such joy

106
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:05,561
that the saints will punish you
with boils and toothaches.

107
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,230
Why are you always talking
about the devil?

108
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:10,198
Father never does.

109
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:14,528
Because the devil
seduces the innocent

110
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:19,451
and seeks to destroy goodness
before it can blossom.

111
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:22,335
I always say my prayers, Mother.

112
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,207
Who did you dance with
last night?

113
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,423
I danced

114
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,921
with him...

115
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:33,134
him...

116
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:35,056
and him.

117
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:38,386
Why do you want to know?

118
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:41,101
I had such wicked dreams last night.

119
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,061
What did you dream, Mother?

120
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:50,029
I wish I had dreams too.

121
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:53,617
Big, wonderful dreams.

122
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,279
But I never do.

123
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:01,950
Now the skirts, Mother.

124
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:05,417
The blue one, and the bright one
with gold thread.

125
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,566
Pull harder,

126
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:37,361
or it won't puff out
the way it should.

127
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,739
You forgot the necklace.

128
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:43,660
Leave the necklace for Sunday.
This is quite enough already.

129
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:50,173
You're in my light.

130
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:54,504
That's your father.
Now he's angry.

131
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:02,019
Sick, are you?
Mother said some such thing.

132
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:07,023
Do I look sick to you?

133
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:10,561
Pale and frail and ill?

134
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:13,151
Is this proper,
sleeping past sunrise?

135
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:16,533
Father, when I get to church,
I'll kiss Father Erik's hand

136
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:20,241
and beg forgiveness
for not arriving in time for matins.

137
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:23,331
"Mother was sick," I'll say.

138
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:25,618
"And Father was sick,
and Frida was sick,

139
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:27,502
so they didn't wake me.

140
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:29,880
And the candles weren't yet dipped,

141
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:32,716
and Blackie wasn't yet shod."

142
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:44,394
I'll ride into the mountains
with this naughty girl,

143
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,392
and I'll say...

144
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:49,559
"I won't have such a daughter.

145
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,861
Imprison her in the mountains
for seven years

146
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:55,447
until she's been tamed.

147
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:58,450
Then I'll come
take her home again...

148
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,406
maybe."

149
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:08,081
Let Ingeri come too, Father.
She never gets away from the farm.

150
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:16,753
It's a shame
it's such a long way to church.

151
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:21,344
A woman like you no doubt needs
a confessional closer at hand.

152
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:26,479
Says the man who had to flee
the country to save his hide.

153
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:29,435
I know all about you, Professor.

154
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,191
Now, now.

155
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,445
A bird on the wing finds something,
while those who sit still find only death.

156
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:37,940
I've seen
both women and churches.

157
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:42,031
- What were the churches like?
- Tall as the sky.

158
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,200
And big.

159
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:47,081
Not of wood,
but of mortar and stone.

160
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,624
With windows
in every color of the rainbow.

161
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,298
You get to come too, Ingeri.

162
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,175
Father promised.

163
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:05,134
Now be on your way,
or you won't get there until nightfall.

164
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:07,936
Hurry up, Ingeri.

165
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,312
Drink some warm ale.

166
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:15,102
It's a long journey,
and you've eaten nothing.

167
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:18,568
I don't want it. Give it to Ingeri.
She's coming along.

168
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:21,905
- When was that decided?
- Father said so just now.

169
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,328
You could at least give me
a farewell kiss.

170
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:42,755
Christ our Lord,
bless this young life.

171
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:55,230
These cheese cakes and candles

172
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:58,312
are for Father Erik from me.

173
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:00,856
Give him my best wishes

174
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,571
and tell him they're for
"you know what."

175
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:08,535
And he should say
five Our Fathers and 15 Hail Marys.

176
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:52,992
<i>So lovely an apple orchard I know</i>

177
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:57,921
<i>A maiden with virtues so dear</i>

178
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:03,214
<i>Her hair like spun gold does flow</i>

179
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:08,299
<i>Her eyes like the heavens so clear</i>

180
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:13,058
<i>The streams flow so merrily</i>

181
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:17,641
<i>All under the verdant trees</i>

182
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:22,817
<i>In springtime's breeze</i>

183
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:10,990
<i>The little bird, he soars so high</i>

184
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:14,873
<i>And rides the wind on his wing</i>

185
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:19,336
<i>It is such work, such work to fly</i>

186
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:23,416
<i>And over high mountains to spring</i>

187
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:27,343
<i>The streams flow so merrily</i>

188
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:31,177
<i>All under the verdant trees</i>

189
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:36,186
<i>In springtime's breeze</i>

190
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:57,491
Does the baby hurt you, Ingeri?
What's the matter?

191
00:22:57,668 --> 00:22:59,876
You'll learn for yourself one day.

192
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:04,419
Then I'll be married,
and mistress of my house with honor.

193
00:23:04,592 --> 00:23:06,458
We'll see about your honor

194
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:09,469
when a man takes your waist
or strokes your neck.

195
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:12,551
No man will get me to bed
without marriage.

196
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:16,643
And if he meets you in the pasture
and pulls you down behind a bush?

197
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,553
I'll fight my way free.

198
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:21,606
But he's stronger than you.

199
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,071
You're too late for matins,
you know.

200
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:39,332
But better to bloom on the road
than wither in church.

201
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,417
I'm taking candles to church.

202
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:43,749
I see.
In the Holy Virgin's honor,

203
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:45,835
you've bedecked
and bejeweled yourself

204
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,798
like a bride for her groom.

205
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:51,302
No, because it's such nice weather,
and because Mother was against it.

206
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,922
Not because I expected
to meet you.

207
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,223
Thank you for last night.

208
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:58,514
- There's nothing to thank me for.
- Really?

209
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:01,897
No, and you know that
just as well as I.

210
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:15,243
What is it, Ingeri?

211
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:17,950
I saw you two
in the barn last night.

212
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,285
I wanted to speak to him about you,

213
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,792
about help for you and the child.

214
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:26,580
He probably said there'd be help
if you offered him your mouth,

215
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:29,503
and even more if you rolled
with him in the hay!

216
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:34,838
You smiled at him...

217
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:37,598
and took his hand in the dance.

218
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:40,560
I danced with anyone
who offered me his hand.

219
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:46,607
Forgive me for slapping you.

220
00:24:47,111 --> 00:24:49,478
Don't ask <i>me</i> for forgiveness!

221
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:54,209
- Let's turn back.
- Why? We must get to church.

222
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:56,631
I'll take the candles
and explain to Father.

223
00:25:56,764 --> 00:25:59,381
Why? Mother and Father
wouldn't like that.

224
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:02,972
The forest is so dark!
I can't go on!

225
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:08,356
Don't cry so hard.
You could hurt the child.

226
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,564
Are the young maidens
frightened of the forest?

227
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:15,989
I'm not frightened.
I'm going to church.

228
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:19,572
May she rest in your cottage
until I come back?

229
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:22,996
Look here.
This is enough for both of you.

230
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:29,044
Did you think
I was going to slap you again?

231
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:42,678
Are you in labor?

232
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,602
Worse than that.

233
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:53,105
Come, I can help.

234
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:31,355
Sit down.

235
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:35,815
It's been so long since anyone sat
with me in the seat of honor.

236
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,664
What's your name?

237
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:51,872
Nowadays I have no name.

238
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:58,508
This is a quiet, lonely place.

239
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:01,586
You're a long way from neighbors.

240
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:04,297
I hear what I want to hear

241
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:07,054
and see what I want to see.

242
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:11,183
I hear what men whisper in secret

243
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:15,525
and see what they think
no one sees.

244
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:20,022
You can hear it yourself,
if you wish.

245
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:22,365
Just listen.

246
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:27,617
What's that pounding outside?

247
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:31,951
Three dead men riding north.

248
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:46,302
It's been a long time since a woman
made my chair narrower for me.

249
00:29:01,615 --> 00:29:05,734
Here is a cure for your anguish.

250
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:13,742
Here is a cure for your woe.

251
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:22,713
Blood, course no more.

252
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:31,513
Fish, stop still in the brook...

253
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:37,140
and you, eagle, in the sky.

254
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,949
Here is the power.

255
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:54,123
You've taken human blood.

256
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,827
You've made an offering to Odin.

257
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:03,129
I recognized you
at once on the path

258
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:07,971
by your eyes,
your mouth, your hands.

259
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:10,214
But you're afraid.

260
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:12,763
You mustn't be.

261
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:15,728
I will give you strength.

262
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:55,963
What a funny little mouth harp!

263
00:32:56,475 --> 00:33:00,515
I inherited it from my father,
who inherited it from his,

264
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,352
who inherited it from his.

265
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:04,138
May I please see?

266
00:33:08,445 --> 00:33:09,981
Who are you?

267
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:14,445
Three brothers who lost
both father and mother too early.

268
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:16,655
Who takes care of you?

269
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:20,830
We drink from the creek
and eat roots from the earth.

270
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:23,325
Mother gave me a lunch sack.

271
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:28,830
- My brother says...
- Is your brother mute?

272
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,624
Evil men cut his tongue
out of his throat.

273
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,671
No!

274
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:35,594
But I understand him.

275
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:39,261
He says only if the proud maiden
will keep us company

276
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,175
can we accept such a gift.

277
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:44,770
I must ride to church
with the Holy Mother's candles.

278
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:48,896
- For matins?
- I'm too late for that.

279
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,689
I overslept.

280
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,813
But if matins are over,
there's no great hurry.

281
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:56,949
And if your dear mother made
a lunch for her proud maiden,

282
00:33:57,077 --> 00:33:59,034
she meant for her to eat.

283
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:03,240
My brother says there's
a nice glade warmed by the sun,

284
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:06,033
if only the proud maiden
would join us there.

285
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:26,364
O blessed Jesus,
God the Father's son,

286
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:29,579
you are the living bread
that from heaven comes.

287
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:38,342
You bless me
with this bodily bread

288
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:41,720
and save my soul
from eternal death.

289
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:05,490
My brother's very curious:
Where is the proud maiden's farm?

290
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:08,702
It's east of the mountain
and west of the forest,

291
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:12,744
and so large that you must press
your neck hard against your back

292
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,996
to see the battlements.

293
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:18,170
The proud maiden
must be a king's daughter.

294
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:21,882
Father wears silk garments every day,
and a golden helmet,

295
00:36:22,055 --> 00:36:24,843
and his lance flashes
like gold in the sun.

296
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:29,135
And Mother's key ring is so heavy,
she can't wear it on her belt.

297
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:33,765
A little maid follows behind her all day,
carrying it on a pillow.

298
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:38,061
And you three could be
enchanted princes

299
00:36:38,238 --> 00:36:40,480
under a wood nymph's spell.

300
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:46,153
And the goats could be bears
and wolves that she has transformed.

301
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:11,435
My brother says the proud maiden
has such white hands.

302
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:16,728
Because princesses needn't do
the washing or make fires.

303
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:27,277
My brother says the proud maiden
has such a pretty neck.

304
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:31,906
To make a princess's gold necklace
shine all the brighter.

305
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:42,793
My brother says the proud maiden
has such a narrow waist.

306
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:48,763
Cut this up
and we can all have some.

307
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:52,055
But perhaps you have no knife?

308
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:08,283
These look like
Simon of Snollsta's marks.

309
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:48,149
I'm on my way to church
with the Virgin's candles.

310
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:41,108
Watch the goats
till we come back.

311
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:43,948
Do as I say,
or you know what will happen.

312
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:58,083
If you have something to say,
speak up.

313
00:45:58,965 --> 00:46:01,298
We have nothing
to say except that...

314
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:04,752
the night is cold and the road long.

315
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:07,212
Where are you from?

316
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:10,591
The north. The northwest.

317
00:46:12,687 --> 00:46:14,428
How's the winter been there?

318
00:46:14,981 --> 00:46:18,520
It's been hard,
and there's been much sickness.

319
00:46:18,943 --> 00:46:22,607
The people are faint with hunger
and can hardly leave their cottages,

320
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,772
while the cows sink down
in their stalls.

321
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:27,779
So I've heard.

322
00:46:28,244 --> 00:46:30,861
You've had a crippling winter.

323
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:38,043
Where are you headed?
- We seek work further south.

324
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:42,214
You may sleep in the manor hall.
There will be frost tonight.

325
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:35,767
Good evening.

326
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:41,019
We met the master in the yard,
and he invited us in.

327
00:47:41,192 --> 00:47:43,275
Sit there until he comes.

328
00:48:13,766 --> 00:48:16,304
Those shoes
have been through a lot.

329
00:48:22,108 --> 00:48:26,899
A day can start out beautifully
yet end in misery.

330
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:31,690
Rarely have I seen a morning
so full of promise as this morning.

331
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:38,330
The sun shone in all its fairness
and made you forget winter's rages.

332
00:48:41,502 --> 00:48:44,336
My legs wanted to dance for joy...

333
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:49,007
but before nightfall she lay dead.

334
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:54,254
I saw the May Queen herself
ride into the sun...

335
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:57,512
but she never returned.

336
00:50:21,894 --> 00:50:25,387
O blessed Jesus,
God the Father's son...

337
00:50:26,065 --> 00:50:27,806
you are the living bread

338
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:30,358
that from heaven comes.

339
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:35,189
You bless me
with this bodily bread

340
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:38,780
and save my soul
from eternal death.

341
00:52:07,458 --> 00:52:10,201
- Did you finish?
- Yes.

342
00:52:10,336 --> 00:52:12,919
The northern pasture
has been fertilized and plowed.

343
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:17,958
My father used to say,
"Feed the clay heavy, the sand light."

344
00:52:25,768 --> 00:52:28,306
Please forgive
my poor little brother.

345
00:52:28,646 --> 00:52:30,228
Is he like this often?

346
00:52:30,606 --> 00:52:33,223
Only when we've starved
for a long time.

347
00:52:33,901 --> 00:52:37,315
Rub his temples and hands
with salt and vinegar,

348
00:52:37,488 --> 00:52:40,356
and place a warm wooden lid
on his belly.

349
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:42,649
Thank you kindly,
but there's no need.

350
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:45,409
The less fuss made,
the quicker it passes.

351
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:08,016
There'll be work here on the farm.

352
00:53:09,103 --> 00:53:11,186
But we can discuss that tomorrow.

353
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:20,149
You can keep the fire burning.
It'll be bitterly cold.

354
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:34,746
Good night.

355
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:41,586
Come.

356
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:44,715
Come on.

357
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:02,858
Good night.

358
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:12,118
You say your prayers, don't you,

359
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:14,411
even if no one keeps after you?

360
00:54:15,878 --> 00:54:18,086
You poor thing.

361
00:54:18,881 --> 00:54:21,749
But God is merciful,

362
00:54:22,301 --> 00:54:24,918
more merciful than you think.

363
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:28,137
Say your prayers properly tonight,

364
00:54:28,557 --> 00:54:30,844
and don't forget them from now on.

365
00:55:29,368 --> 00:55:33,908
See how the smoke trembles
in the roof hole?

366
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:38,533
As if whimpering and afraid.

367
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:43,500
Yet it's only going out
into the open air,

368
00:55:43,924 --> 00:55:47,463
where it has the whole sky
to tumble about in.

369
00:55:48,262 --> 00:55:50,345
But it doesn't know that.

370
00:55:51,515 --> 00:55:57,261
So it cowers and trembles
under the sooty ridge of the roof.

371
00:55:59,857 --> 00:56:02,270
People are the same way.

372
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:07,069
They worry and tremble
like leaves in a storm...

373
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:10,190
because of what they know...

374
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:13,409
and what they don't know.

375
00:56:15,289 --> 00:56:16,450
You...

376
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:21,201
shall cross a narrow plank...

377
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:26,581
so narrow you can't find your footing.

378
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:30,839
Below you roars a great river.

379
00:56:31,972 --> 00:56:33,679
It's black...

380
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:35,890
and wants to swallow you up.

381
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:38,927
But you pass over it unharmed.

382
00:56:40,898 --> 00:56:43,390
Before you lies a chasm...

383
00:56:44,735 --> 00:56:47,899
so deep you can't see the bottom.

384
00:56:48,947 --> 00:56:51,405
Hands grope for you...

385
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:54,116
but they can't reach you.

386
00:56:57,998 --> 00:57:02,834
At last you stand
before a mountain of terror.

387
00:57:03,921 --> 00:57:06,584
It spews fire like a furnace,

388
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:10,333
and a vast abyss opens at its feet.

389
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:14,091
A thousand colors blaze there:

390
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:15,926
copper and iron,

391
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:18,762
blue vitriol and yellow sulfur.

392
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:24,356
Flames dazzle and flash
and lash at the rocks.

393
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:28,606
And all about, men leap and writhe...

394
00:57:28,946 --> 00:57:30,903
small as ants...

395
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:34,357
for this is the furnace

396
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:39,074
that swallows up
murderers and evildoers.

397
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:46,244
But the very moment
you think you're doomed,

398
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:51,296
a hand shall grasp you
and an arm circle around you,

399
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:54,461
and you'll be taken far away...

400
00:57:56,056 --> 00:57:59,800
where evil no longer
has power over you.

401
00:58:17,536 --> 00:58:20,199
If Karin doesn't come home tonight...

402
00:58:21,248 --> 00:58:23,831
she'll surely return tomorrow.

403
00:58:28,797 --> 00:58:31,210
Calm down, Märeta.

404
00:58:32,384 --> 00:58:34,967
How can you tell me to calm down?

405
00:58:35,387 --> 00:58:37,754
That's all you ever say.

406
00:58:38,682 --> 00:58:42,847
What would have become of us
if I'd always done like you?

407
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:48,348
Never troubled or worried,
never praying to God.

408
00:58:51,695 --> 00:58:53,812
Open your fists, Märeta.

409
00:58:53,989 --> 00:58:55,696
Open your fists!

410
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:05,368
I know you're worried about Karin.

411
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:07,784
She's all I have!

412
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:14,924
But she's stayed in the village
overnight without permission before.

413
00:59:15,052 --> 00:59:17,089
She's all I have.

414
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,743
She's the only one I have left.

415
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:11,889
They struck the boy.

416
01:00:31,795 --> 01:00:34,333
I thought I heard the boy scream.

417
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:39,133
It was just an owl in the forest.
We've heard it all night.

418
01:01:39,738 --> 01:01:41,695
This silk shift...

419
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:46,280
and what's in this bag
is all we have left of our sister.

420
01:01:46,411 --> 01:01:48,528
She died at Candlemas.

421
01:01:50,415 --> 01:01:52,782
It's a precious keepsake...

422
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:57,370
but need knows no law,

423
01:01:57,547 --> 01:02:00,506
and we thought
we would offer it to you.

424
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:03,543
We see you are a lady

425
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:06,216
who understands
the value of beautiful things...

426
01:02:07,098 --> 01:02:10,387
and this is what
our sister treasured most.

427
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:20,438
It's a bit torn and spotted...

428
01:02:21,071 --> 01:02:23,358
but look at the embroidery.

429
01:02:23,531 --> 01:02:26,274
It's surely the work
of nine young maidens.

430
01:02:32,249 --> 01:02:36,664
Skillful hands like yours will know
how to make it like new again.

431
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:45,418
I must ask my husband...

432
01:02:46,263 --> 01:02:52,009
what a fitting reward would be
for such a valuable garment.

433
01:02:58,275 --> 01:03:03,816
Now see that you get some rest too.

434
01:04:41,336 --> 01:04:43,328
What's the matter, Märeta?

435
01:04:45,256 --> 01:04:47,919
The herdsmen offered it to me for sale.

436
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:52,549
It's Karin's.

437
01:04:57,018 --> 01:04:58,884
There's blood on it.

438
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:17,702
What are you going to do?

439
01:05:18,456 --> 01:05:20,914
First I'll put the crossbar
on the outer door.

440
01:05:21,042 --> 01:05:22,783
It's already done.

441
01:05:53,116 --> 01:05:55,733
Will you take the farmhands with you?

442
01:06:07,297 --> 01:06:09,004
Be careful!

443
01:06:47,879 --> 01:06:49,916
Tell me what you know.

444
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:52,339
Kill me first.

445
01:06:54,802 --> 01:06:57,089
My guilt is greater than theirs.

446
01:06:57,388 --> 01:06:59,345
I willed it to happen.

447
01:06:59,557 --> 01:07:02,550
Ever since I became with child,
I've hated her.

448
01:07:05,772 --> 01:07:09,607
The very day I prayed for it,
he did it.

449
01:07:10,652 --> 01:07:13,565
It was him and me,
not the herdsmen.

450
01:07:13,821 --> 01:07:15,778
He possessed them,

451
01:07:15,949 --> 01:07:19,033
and they threw themselves
on her like devils, all at once.

452
01:07:19,202 --> 01:07:22,286
They fell upon her and held her down...

453
01:07:23,581 --> 01:07:25,538
and they took her.

454
01:07:26,209 --> 01:07:28,292
You saw it?

455
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:31,127
I was in the forest.

456
01:07:31,381 --> 01:07:33,043
I saw it...

457
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:36,007
and willed it to happen.

458
01:07:38,263 --> 01:07:41,427
I picked up a rock to throw at them,

459
01:07:41,849 --> 01:07:44,091
but I let it fall.

460
01:07:44,978 --> 01:07:46,970
And when it was over,

461
01:07:47,355 --> 01:07:49,517
they beat her to death with a club.

462
01:07:51,526 --> 01:07:53,609
I saw that too!

463
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:04,987
Heat up the bath.

464
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:08,411
I'll get some birch branches.

465
01:10:30,852 --> 01:10:33,469
Bring me the butcher's knife.

466
01:18:32,291 --> 01:18:33,873
No!

467
01:20:19,231 --> 01:20:21,644
God forgive me
for what I've done.

468
01:20:59,688 --> 01:21:01,725
We must find Karin.

469
01:22:28,777 --> 01:22:32,270
I loved her too much, Töre,
more than God himself.

470
01:22:32,448 --> 01:22:36,283
When I saw how she favored you,
I began to hate you.

471
01:22:36,410 --> 01:22:39,903
It's me God meant to punish.
I bear the guilt.

472
01:22:40,914 --> 01:22:45,409
You're not alone, Märeta,
and God alone knows where guilt lies.

473
01:25:13,942 --> 01:25:15,729
You saw it.

474
01:25:16,737 --> 01:25:18,899
God, you saw it!

475
01:25:21,783 --> 01:25:25,572
An innocent child's death,
and my vengeance.

476
01:25:28,665 --> 01:25:30,657
You allowed it to happen!

477
01:25:36,048 --> 01:25:38,005
I don't understand you!

478
01:25:43,805 --> 01:25:46,218
I don't understand you!

479
01:25:56,735 --> 01:25:59,603
Yet still I ask your forgiveness.

480
01:26:04,242 --> 01:26:07,326
I know no other way
to make peace with myself

481
01:26:07,454 --> 01:26:09,491
than with my own hands.

482
01:26:11,416 --> 01:26:14,124
I know no other way to live.

483
01:26:25,806 --> 01:26:27,889
I promise you, God...

484
01:26:29,434 --> 01:26:33,553
here, by the dead body
of my only child,

485
01:26:34,022 --> 01:26:38,312
I promise
that as penance for my sin,

486
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:41,193
I shall build you a church.

487
01:26:41,863 --> 01:26:44,150
On this spot I shall build it.

488
01:26:45,033 --> 01:26:47,195
Out of mortar and stone...

489
01:26:51,373 --> 01:26:53,535
and with these very hands!

490
01:29:11,054 --> 01:29:17,016
<i>O Lord, receive my soul</i>

491
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:26,894
<i>And grant me everlasting peace</i>

492
01:29:27,362 --> 01:29:35,452
<i>Grant me everlasting peace</i>

493
01:29:35,912 --> 01:29:44,412
<i>At your side, O Lord</i>
