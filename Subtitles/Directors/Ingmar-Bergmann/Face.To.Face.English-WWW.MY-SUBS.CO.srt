Hi, grandma. It's Jenny.
How are you?

3
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,486
The weather's so beautiful.

4
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,092
Yes, they just took the last of the furniture.
It looks so empty.

5
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,610
No, dinner's impossible.
I must be at the clinic first.

6
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,934
Yes, I'll be there at eight.
Give grandpa my love.

7
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:44,688
I think you'd feel a lot better
if you got up and washed and dressed.

8
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,406
In any case we should open the curtains.
It's quite warm in here.

9
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,216
Last time I saw you we had a good talk.

10
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,535
What's happened now?

11
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,371
You know that I know
you're putting on an act.

12
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,295
What good is that?

13
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,089
Forehead...

14
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,530
Cheek...

15
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,135
Eye...

16
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,528
Mouth...

17
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,448
You mustn't.

18
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,771
Poor Jenny.

19
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,816
Poor Jenny.

20
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,571
Poor Jenny...

21
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,648
- Jenny!
- Grandma!

22
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,086
Come in.

23
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:23,407
- Lovely! If you knew how happy I am...
- Lovely, I know.

24
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:28,654
- Grandpa and I looked forward to this.
- Where is grandpa?

25
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,572
Grandpa, how are you?

26
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:45,496
Here I am and I'm staying for two months.
Eric is in Chicago at a congress.

27
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,767
We just talked on the telephone. He says there'll
be so much to tell you when he's home again.

28
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,177
Come along now and I'll show
you to your room. I'll put you

29
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:01,448
in your old room. It's quiet, you won't be disturbed
at all. There's no noise from the street in the summer.

30
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:06,250
- Oh grandma, you didn't have to...
- You know the furniture you had as a girl?

31
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,887
It's been brought down for you. Do you
recognize it?

32
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,255
And your old desk...

33
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:21,886
You must tell me if there's anything you need.
Grandpa and I have so looked

34
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,126
- forward to you coming.
- So have I.

35
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,336
We'd better go and have some tea
with grandpa.

36
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,326
He gets so impatient if he
has to wait.

37
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,733
Can you help grandpa?

38
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,373
And how's my little Anna?

39
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,340
Anna's gone off to riding camp.
She's in love

40
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:58,573
with a three year older boy, who's been
telling her all about the world revolution.

41
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:04,172
- Is he also at riding camp?
- Anna is 14 years old

42
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,013
- and can take care of herself.
- Sugar in your tea?

43
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,214
Yes, please. Three lumps.

44
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,694
Oh grandma, you've made scones. And
I've been considering a diet...

45
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,048
That's nonsense.

46
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,410
Well, after riding camp, Anna will
be staying with a friend.

47
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,806
And she won't be home until
school begins.

48
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:35,337
- And when will the new house be ready?
- In August, I hope.

49
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:39,532
The construction man has promised,
but you never know.

50
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:44,096
- And you work at the hospital all summer?
- Yes.

51
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,894
Does that mean you'll have
no time to rest?

52
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,416
Eric and I thought about going to Italy
in October, but we'll see.

53
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,852
- What sort of substitute is it?
- I'm filling in as senior physician.

54
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:04,213
- I hope you're well paid.
- Thank you grandma, I'm very well paid.

55
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,568
Are you happy at work?

56
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,490
I'm happy wherever I am.

57
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,728
- How is it?
- With me? Just fine.

58
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:31,530
- Something wrong between you and Eric?
- Not at all!

59
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:37,614
- Well, something's wrong.
- I'm just a little tired.

60
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,326
I haven't recovered from the flu I had in
spring. I must take vitamins.

61
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,607
Let's go and say goodnight to grandpa.

62
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:59,736
Grandpa loves to look at these
old pictures.

63
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,486
He looks at them for hours.

64
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,294
That could be the summer of 1948.

65
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,572
It must be, because Greta
has a big belly

66
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:17,691
and Ragnar was born in September.

67
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,092
There were so many of us.

68
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,772
And that damned boat that always
broke down when we needed it.

69
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,726
How I hated that boat.

70
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:36,335
- You were daddy's little girl.
- There were reasons for it.

71
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,308
Goodnight. Sleep well.

72
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,776
Don't look at the pictures too long
or your eyes will start to hurt.

73
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,654
20 years ago I realised the unfathomable
brutality in our methods

74
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:50,455
and the total meltdown of psychoanalysis.
I don't think we can cure one person.

75
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,849
One or two will be cured
despite our efforts.

76
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:58,047
I think you'll get to keep Maria for a
while, if you don't mind it.

77
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,574
You're the boss.
At least for now.

78
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,773
I'm going. I'm having lunch
with the interior minister,

79
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:10,574
an incurably normal neurotic.

80
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,206
Goodbye.

81
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:19,288
And leave Maria to me when you've had it.
Ideally before Erneman comes back from Australia.

82
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:25,131
He's understood that this is a factory where ends
must meet and likes the lunatics to be rotated.

83
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:30,453
That's why the politicians love him so much and
let him travel around the world, spreading the gospel.

84
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:36,571
By the way, are you coming
to my wife's party?

85
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,732
- Are you?
- No. She's revealing her new lover.

86
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,969
Young Mr. Strömberg.

87
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,493
- The actor?
- The very same.

88
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:51,690
He is exactly 26 years younger than my wife.
It's all very touching.

89
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,975
- I mean it, without irony.
- Isn't Strömberg...

90
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,006
Yes, but Elisabeth loves his friends too.
She's like a mother to them.

91
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,090
I think I'm going.

92
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:09,936
Tell her that my prognosis for young
Mr. Strömberg is bad and that I,

93
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,326
despite everything, love her.

94
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:20,611
Dear Jenny!
Are you showing up already!

95
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:24,776
- I thought it was at five?
- No, it was at two.

96
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,811
Almost everyone has left.

97
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,688
Come in. It's so good to see you!

98
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:39,456
What a nice costume you have.
Let me see... it's completely wonderful.

99
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,609
You are so beautiful. Ah,
to be looking like that!

100
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,730
How lovely to see you.
Come in.

101
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,048
Where's your husband? Oh, right,
he's in America.

102
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,089
This is Michael.

103
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:05,368
I'm very much in love with him.
Actually.

104
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,451
He's so good to me.

105
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:17,087
And this is his best friend,
Ludvig.

106
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:23,335
We're going to Bahamas, the
three of us.

107
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:27,696
And this is Tomas. I'm sure you've
heard about him.

108
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,811
He travels to developing countries,
teaching girls to use contraceptives.

109
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,615
And he's the cutest doctor in the world
if you have heart problems,

110
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,806
if you know what I mean...

111
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,414
And this...

112
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,726
Who is this? Michael, do you
remember who this is?

113
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,133
Let's not bother him. He's taken
a little nap and he deserves it

114
00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:00,788
after telling us all off a
while ago. My, what a

115
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:05,773
speech that was. And this is
a pair of sweet girls.

116
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:11,092
And capable.
They've opened a little store at the corner.

117
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:17,134
I think we should offer the
boys some strawberries.

118
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:22,936
Aren't they fantastic, with
their transparent dresses.

119
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:29,008
Imagine us in those clothes...

120
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,529
Imagine that.

121
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,928
Are you happy now?

122
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,411
I'm only telling this to you,
because you understand.

123
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,089
- Of course there are problems.
- Really?

124
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,766
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

125
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:05,172
Michael is very complicated. I almost
get scared of him sometimes.

126
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,376
And Ludvig is a bad seed.

127
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:19,409
But generally, you could say that
I am somewhat happy.

128
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,413
Are you alright, Elisabeth?

129
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,246
I'm grateful.

130
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:38,932
Humbly grateful. Not only because
of Michael.

131
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,853
But because I have
myself safe and sound.

132
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:54,327
And because I know that it's my feelings.
There is no distance between...

133
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,650
Never mind, I'm drivelling.

134
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,487
I almost envy you.

135
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,536
We have to leave.
We're going to the countryside.

136
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,940
Sorry that you have to go now, but
thank you for coming.

137
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,213
Oh, it was lovely.

138
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,456
- How are you?
- Fine, how are you?

139
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,849
Always fine.

140
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,209
- What do we talk about now?
- We have an...

141
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,614
Sorry.

142
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,855
-... an excellent topic.
- Really?

143
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:44,568
- A patient who happens to be my half-sister.
- Oh, Maria.

144
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,406
Exactly.

145
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,856
It feels inappropriate to talk about a
patient in this environment.

146
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,215
- It's not necessary.
- How do you mean?

147
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,848
We could have dinner together.

148
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,893
There's a great fish restaurant
nearby.

149
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,367
- I...
- Of course. We can do it another time.

150
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,332
I'm in town until the end of August.

151
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:28,248
Shouldn't we go to the restaurant?
I'm just going to make a call.

152
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,536
If the offer stands, of course.

153
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:21,366
Hi, Martin. Thank God I got ahold
of you. I can't see you tonight.

154
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,452
What? Yes, a patient.

155
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:31,447
Have I met someone who is funnier?
You're so silly.

156
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:38,653
There's no point in having jealousy
between us.

157
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,975
Goodbye.

158
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,252
Oh, lord!

159
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:05,807
Shall we, or do you cling to
your impulse of escaping?

160
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,207
- They serve an excellent sole.
- I'm quite hungry.

161
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,776
Let's eat then, and see what happens
next. Is that fine?

162
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,894
The house is crumbling.

163
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:40,486
Sometimes I consider getting
something more modern.

164
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:45,006
When there was a woman in the house,
the garden was nice but now it's...

165
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,015
- What would you like to drink?
- I'm fine.

166
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,812
- How are you?
- How are you?

167
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:56,410
- I'm fine. As always, I must say.
- Congratulations.

168
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:01,050
- Coffee?
- Maybe later. Do you play?

169
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:05,051
- No, my wife did.
- Is she dead?

170
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:10,055
- We divorced a couple of years ago.
- Was it as successful as everything else?

171
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,971
The divorce was the most successful
thing we did.

172
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:19,900
- Imagine that my husband is gone for three months.
- I know, you hinted at it during dinner.

173
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,455
- I actually miss him.
- Of course.

174
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:28,126
I've got myself a lover who isn't half
as nice. Can you understand that?

175
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:34,334
Sort of. What other cures do you
have for your anxiety?

176
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,851
We're moving to a new house
this autumn.

177
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,010
- How nice.
- Are you bored?

178
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:46,852
Not at all. I'm just wondering if your
breasts aren't tremendously beautiful.

179
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:51,607
To still your curiosity, I can tell
you that they are very beautiful.

180
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:56,130
- You'll have to do with that explanation.
- You misread me, but that's fine.

181
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,488
- A cigarette?
- I don't smoke.

182
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,256
Wise.

183
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,456
Anyway, I'm going home.
Will you call for a taxi?

184
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,808
Wait a moment.

185
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:12,414
- I'm very tired.
- Just listen for a moment.

186
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,166
Go on.

187
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:22,086
Can't we be friends?
Don't look so ironic, I mean it.

188
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,494
Are you listening?

189
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,330
Sure.

190
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:38,889
I just want to know how you've imagined
us getting from here to your bedroom.

191
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:46,894
How you've figured out overwinning
the awkwardness of getting undressed.

192
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:55,288
What amazing techniques you'll use to
satisfy me, and yourself.

193
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:02,296
What demands you place
on my performance.

194
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:12,051
How advanced and impulsive you
allow me to be.

195
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:17,454
- You're very funny.
- Too bad, because I'm serious.

196
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:24,948
I also want to know how you've envisioned
the termination of the sex.

197
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,108
Tenderly and quietly?

198
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,090
A cigarette glowing in the morning light?

199
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:39,287
Nervous talk about the next time and
exchanging of phone numbers?

200
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:45,970
- I can at least drive you home.
- No thanks. I'll take a taxi.

201
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,687
A taxi for Söderhamnsvägen 9, please.

202
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,930
Thank you.

203
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,617
Goodbye then, Jenny.

204
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:22,532
Thank you for a pleasant afternoon.
Hope we'll meet again.

205
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:29,254
- Maybe we could go to the movies.
- Or a concert.

206
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,890
That would be nice.

207
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:36,173
- I'll call you.
- Maybe I'll call you.

208
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:39,934
- That would surprise me.
- Maybe I'll call just because of that.

209
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,567
- It's so light.
- It's almost two o'clock.

210
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,486
- Are you running around again?
- The clock.

211
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:54,416
- We wound it up properly last night.
- It stops.

212
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,766
- It doesn't.
- It's lagging.

213
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,816
It's just like all the other
clocks.

214
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:06,610
But if you keep fooling with it, I'm
sure it will break.

215
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:19,534
I'm not placing you in a nursing home.

216
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:23,772
It's all in your head, do you hear me?

217
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,228
Old age is hell.

218
00:31:54,200 --> 00:32:00,207
There, there. You always have me.
I'm always by your side.

219
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:06,613
- Don't be so nervous.
- I'm sorry.

220
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,894
Come and lie in my bed.

221
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:15,650
Then you'll sleep better and
feel calm.

222
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:19,813
Then I'll just snore.

223
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:24,086
I've already slept enough.

224
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,850
Come now.

225
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,007
We'll have it comfortable.

226
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,572
- Where are my slippers?
- What slippers?

227
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:39,447
- The other ones.
- They're in the closet.

228
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,812
- No, I looked there.
- Yes, my dear, I put them there.

229
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,656
You never find anything.

230
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:51,851
- Don't be so stubborn. They're not there.
- I know that they are there.

231
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,936
Who is it?

232
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,655
Who are you calling?

233
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:02,611
I must get Maria to the hospital.

234
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,376
- Is it such a hurry?
- She's unconscious.

235
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,768
Are you sure that we drugged her?

236
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,975
- In any case she must get to the hospital.
- Wait a minute.

237
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,413
No need for an ambulance.

238
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,176
Don't be afraid. I won't do anything.

239
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:26,651
I have a proposition: you get out of here
immediately, then I'll take Maria with me.

240
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,889
- Listen to me.
- I'm not interested.

241
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:37,367
Whether you want to know or not, the
situation is this:

242
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,733
Maria called us yesterday and wanted to go
out, so we picked her up.

243
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:47,092
At night she got ill and started yelling
for you and that we must take her to you.

244
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,774
We looked you up in the phone book and
drove her here.

245
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:55,693
Nobody opened, so we crawled in through
the cellar window.

246
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:00,927
When we saw it was all empty, we called
the hospital and got

247
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,373
your current number.

248
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:49,092
She's too tight.

249
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,492
Some have to pay for a fuck, did
you know that?

250
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,086
Call the fucking ambulance.

251
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:06,294
This is Dr. Isaksson at the
psychiatric clinic.

252
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:12,932
I'd like an ambulance for Dennavägen 35.
Yes, right away.

253
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,772
- Let's not talk too much this evening.
- It's completely up to you.

254
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:29,488
- You don't understand.
- No, not really.

255
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:33,413
There are certain moments in life
you just have to get through.

256
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:38,336
- So?
- Certain hours, minutes.

257
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,766
- Is it like that now?
- Maybe.

258
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:47,089
- Anyway, I am grateful that we're together.
- You need a drink.

259
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:55,300
- Our last time was ridiculous. Don't you think?
- I never think it's ridiculous.

260
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:00,380
- Do you have sleeping pills?
- Of course. Want one?

261
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:07,327
Most of all I'd like you to give me
a double dose of those sleeping pills.

262
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:11,487
- Maybe I'll sleep twice as well.
- And then?

263
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:17,252
Then I'd like to sleep here in your bed,
without making love.

264
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,054
You'd hold my hand if needed...

265
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,933
Can you do that?

266
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:54,252
Don't drink if you'll take the
sleeping pills.

267
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:01,729
0,5 mg Valium and two Mogadons.
A good combination.

268
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:05,374
I use it myself without after-
effects.

269
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,695
Drink strong coffee in the morning.

270
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:16,780
- When do you want to be woken?
- Just before 7.

271
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,369
I must be at the hospital by 8:30.

272
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,887
- Come.
- Tomas...

273
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:33,930
If you force things to be as usual,
they'll be as usual. Don't you think?

274
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,335
That's how it is for me.

275
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,973
Something very peculiar
happened to me.

276
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:29,006
When I came to pick Maria up
the other day

277
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:35,568
there were two men in the house.
One of them tried to rape me.

278
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:47,094
At first I got scared, then I
thought it was silly.

279
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,689
Then...

280
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,371
Then?

281
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:04,246
He had his face pushed
against my breast.

282
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:14,975
He was red in the face and tried
to enter me.

283
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:29,966
And suddenly, I wanted him so badly
to make it.

284
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:35,170
Is that so strange?

285
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:45,207
No. What was strange was that even though
I wanted, he couldn't get inside me.

286
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:56,292
Everything was shut...

287
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,135
and dry.

288
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:36,776
I'm sorry.

289
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:39,894
I don't know...

290
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,016
Sit up.

291
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,175
Try...

292
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:09,854
- I don't understand.
- Breathe slowly. Take a deep breath.

293
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:54,732
There, there.

294
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:06,772
I don'twant to!

295
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:40,369
I want to go home. You're getting me a taxi.
I don't want you to drive me home.

296
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:11,735
There, there.

297
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:18,406
Should I call the doctor?

298
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:24,290
There are doctors here
already...

299
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:33,376
I'm just tired.
I want to go home.

300
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:41,295
There's nothing wrong with me.
I want to go home and go to bed.

301
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:57,529
How are you now?

302
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:00,376
Better.

303
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:06,296
Say what you want. I'm driving
you home.

304
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:16,655
- Sorry for being so stupid.
- You should rest.

305
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,288
Tomorrow I'll feel great.
Then I'm free

306
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,972
for two days.

307
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,649
Next time we'll talk only
about you.

308
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:55,973
You slept all day yesterday.

309
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,450
- I started to worry.
- What day is it?

310
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:03,254
It's Saturday, 9 am. I called
the hospital and told them

311
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,572
- that you were ill.
- God, I've slept an entire day.

312
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:10,446
I've made you some breakfast.

313
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,169
Thank you.

314
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:17,852
You should drink some coffee
and eat a sandwich.

315
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:30,609
Unfortunately I can't stay home with you.
Grandpa and I are invited to the Egermans.

316
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:34,646
I can't call it off.

317
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:40,171
Grandpa is so happy to go
to the countryside

318
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:43,848
- for a couple of days.
- I can take care of myself.

319
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:45,976
Are you sure?

320
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,846
It must be Sunday...

321
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:47,008
I should get up and eat.

322
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:54,887
It feels strange.

323
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,615
At least the anxiety is gone.

324
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:21,168
One thing at a time.

325
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:28,648
A bit of food.

326
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:36,168
A walk.

327
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,408
A book...

328
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:46,572
maybe a film.

329
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:51,126
Hi Tomas, it's Jenny.

330
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:56,453
I just wanted to apologise
for last time.

331
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:59,573
It's great.

332
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:06,127
I thought you could take me to the movies?
What do you think?

333
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:48,133
I'm not afraid...

334
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:53,054
not lonely.

335
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:59,168
Not even sad.

336
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,216
It feels quite nice.

337
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:15,580
- Who are these people?
- Never mind.

338
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:20,091
Sit down with me so we
can read on.

339
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:24,008
"ln the castle there lived
an evil old woman...

340
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:28,773
and an even more evil
old man.

341
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:34,533
Before the lord of the castle
went out into war... "

342
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:36,888
What's happening?

343
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:41,574
"They promised to
do so... "

344
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:47,810
- Why am I so afraid?
- "When the knight went... "

345
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:52,250
- It's so hard to breathe.
- Grandma?

346
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:58,366
Why does it smell so bad here?
And it's so hot.

347
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:06,813
- It's so hard to breathe.
- Be quiet now.

348
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:11,536
The temperature is exactly right
and it doesn't smell bad.

349
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:16,768
Old people smell so bad.

350
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:23,373
Grandma and grandpa smell bad.

351
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:33,772
Old people are disgusting.
They always smell so bad.

352
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:40,446
They make it hard to breathe.

353
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:54,214
I hate it when grandma puts her hand
on my shoulder and wants me to kiss it.

354
01:03:55,040 --> 01:04:00,694
- I get scared when you read.
- Be quiet!

355
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:04,416
Quiet!

356
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:22,735
I would advise you not to open the door.

357
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:29,255
- You're just trying to scare me.
- Suit yourself. I've warned you.

358
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:34,530
- If I open the door, I'll wake up.
- You can't wake up.

359
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:38,847
- If I try hard...
- Go on.

360
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:53,772
There's something that I suddenly remember.
My suicide attempt was unsuccessful.

361
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:57,649
- Not entirely.
- What do you mean?

362
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:02,736
Brain damage due to lack of oxygen.
Have you never heard of such fatality?

363
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:07,212
- Is it that decent?
- Yes, dear Jenny.

364
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:09,688
Exactly that decent.

365
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:14,406
- Will I always live like this?
- Be calm.

366
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:20,976
At the hospital, they'll keep you alive,
awake or unconscious.

367
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:26,334
- How long?
- Until you die, properly.

368
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:29,370
And it'll take long?

369
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:33,127
Seconds, minutes, years.
What do I know?

370
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:39,508
- It mustn't be like that.
- Yes, Jenny. It must be exactly like that.

371
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:56,370
- Opening this door makes no difference.
- Your logic is impeccable.

372
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:01,611
- Do you know what's in there?
- How would I?

373
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:05,308
Why did you warn me then?

374
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:08,928
You become grateful for the
horrors you're familiar with.

375
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:12,574
The unknown horrors are worse.

376
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:22,448
- I'm opening it anyway.
- Do so. You have your free will.

377
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:29,011
- Are you leaving?
- Dear Jenny.

378
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:35,300
I don't want to get into more trouble than
I already have. So if you'll excuse me...

379
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:37,490
Don't go.

380
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:43,731
I'm leaving your dream and entering my own.
Don't try to make me stay.

381
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:46,649
Don't go!

382
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:01,213
Alone...

383
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:32,650
Grandma...

384
01:07:57,320 --> 01:07:59,766
If only I could wake up.

385
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:27,131
- Are you cold?
- Yes.

386
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:33,413
- Borrow my scarf.
- Thank you.

387
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:41,052
- You're not afraid any longer?
- I don't think so.

388
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:56,091
I don't want to... I don't want to.

389
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:02,028
Leave me alone...

390
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:11,046
My legs aren't there.

391
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:20,690
Could someone get them over there in
the corner and put them back on?

392
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:23,890
Hello...

393
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:36,975
Are you here...

394
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:41,886
You said we'd go to the movies.
Remember?

395
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:49,370
Then you got quiet and hung up.

396
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:53,975
I didn't know what to think.
It seemed strange.

397
01:09:55,080 --> 01:10:00,291
So I called back and nobody answered.
I thought you had been robbed or something.

398
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:07,173
I really didn't know what to think.
It was just unpleasant.

399
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:12,976
Water?

400
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:15,856
Yes please.

401
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:20,489
There.

402
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:23,651
Careful.

403
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:33,530
I appreciate it.

404
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:38,607
Finally I got so worried that
I came over and rang your doorbell.

405
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:41,286
I asked the doorman to open.

406
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:46,487
I'm falling asleep.

407
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:57,811
- Your patients have been waiting for hours.
- Here?

408
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:02,417
Yes. According to the new contract.
Don't you remember?

409
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,776
Oh, right. How awkward.

410
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:36,535
Help me. They have cut me
in the head. They operated on me.

411
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:46,169
But when they put me together they forgot
the daily fright.

412
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,173
Come back next month.

413
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:13,847
Don't forget your pills.

414
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:27,533
Anna! What are you doing here?
Don't be afraid of me!

415
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:57,295
It smells awful.

416
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:04,490
I'm sweaty and dirty.

417
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:11,967
- Your husband is here.
- Not now...

418
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:34,606
You have a knack for coming
with surprises.

419
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:42,732
I just got off the plane.

420
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:48,255
- It must be horrible.
- Not at all.

421
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,412
- Will you sit down?
- Of course.

422
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:06,733
- I smell so bad.
- Please.

423
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:18,852
Shouldn't you come back tomorrow?
After we've got ourselves together.

424
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:22,647
Sure, but...

425
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:31,210
I must fly back tomorrow. It's hopeless.
I'm being the chairman...

426
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:33,409
Poor you.

427
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:35,929
Don't feel sorry for me.

428
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:41,886
How messed up it is.

429
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:47,212
I've been very wondering.

430
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:51,487
I have never...

431
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:54,932
- Never been so...
- Sorry.

432
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:06,487
- Why did you do it?
- Forgive me.

433
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:12,970
Forgive me...

434
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:20,168
I know that I have a large
part of the blame.

435
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:27,288
But I don't know what it consists of.
I've tried thinking through this...

436
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:31,775
Another time.

437
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:41,772
- Can you rest now?
- Yes, I can. Don't worry.

438
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:48,976
What do you want me to tell grandma?

439
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:52,847
- If she asks...
- You can tell the truth.

440
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:00,211
And Anna?

441
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:07,260
I want to talk her. Can't you
call her at the camp

442
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:10,529
- and ask how she is?
- Of course.

443
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:19,689
Goodbye then.

444
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:23,572
We're going to stay in touch.

445
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:49,334
Take care.

446
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:34,886
Mom, where are you?

447
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:42,296
Dad, I'm home.

448
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:48,416
Why are you hiding?

449
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:53,852
Come forth.
You're just scaring me.

450
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:12,576
Mom, it's me.

451
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:17,929
Dad, it's me!

452
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:23,686
Don't you recognize me?

453
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:35,617
Dad, I like you so much.
You were so kind to me.

454
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:42,017
It was so strange when you
just disappeared.

455
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:47,568
I saw you when you were dead.
You were lying at the mortuary.

456
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:54,532
Dear mom, don't be so afraid.
It's alright.

457
01:18:55,960 --> 01:19:01,171
I'm not nine years old. I'm grown
and have taken sleeping pills

458
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:04,228
but apparently I failed.

459
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:24,692
Dad? Mom? You can't help that you
were always so afraid.

460
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:30,726
Mom, dear little mom.

461
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:37,815
Everything would be so real and
right and precise.

462
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:49,214
Dad, you were so fond of hugging and being
tender. You were so sad and nervous...

463
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:58,613
Then we hurt each other without
meaning it.

464
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:06,089
All life, all the days, all the words
and all the petty things.

465
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:12,576
Dad? Mom?

466
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:22,854
We also had such good times together, no?
I was just a child, I didn't understand...

467
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:34,653
But still, still you shut the door, and
I stood there and burned with guilt!

468
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:39,728
I stood there always at fault and guilty!

469
01:20:55,240 --> 01:20:58,129
Mom! Dad!

470
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:19,931
Go away and never come back!

471
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:27,170
I hate you! I hate you so completely!
And I never want to see

472
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:32,696
your frightened eyes and your frightened
gestures.

473
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:21,016
Tomas...

474
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:30,015
- Why are you looking after me?
- I have my reasons.

475
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:36,851
- By the way, I'm your doctor.
- I didn't know that.

476
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:40,932
- But now you do.
- Is there coffee in that thermos?

477
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:43,686
- Yes.
- Can I have some?

478
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:47,572
No, I think it would make you
feel nauseous.

479
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:50,856
- But you can have lemonade.
- No thanks.

480
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:53,488
You'd better drink.

481
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:02,253
- How can you manage your job?
- I'm on vacation.

482
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:11,733
With nothing better to do than overlooking
a confused suicide attack?

483
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:16,092
- No.
- Tell me a story.

484
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:24,807
When I was nine, I learned to burp.
My older brother educated me.

485
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:31,526
At dinner, I found it suitable to demonstrate
my newly acquired skills

486
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:36,608
for the family. I found a gap
between the meatballs

487
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:42,148
and the apple tart.
There was no success.

488
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:49,047
I was so nervous that I happened
to fart at the same time.

489
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:53,496
- How sad.
- I created some stir, but what a flop.

490
01:23:54,920 --> 01:23:59,095
I was denied the apple tart and the custard
and was told to leave the table at once.

491
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:05,810
- My upbringing was dogmatic.
- Tell me more. Something nice.

492
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:12,491
- I don't know what.
- Anything.

493
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:20,328
Maybe you've read a book or met
an interesting person...

494
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:24,497
Or been to a movie, or on a trip?

495
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:31,768
- Honestly, nothing's happened to me for a year.
- What happened then?

496
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:37,810
- I was abandoned.
- Oh right, you're divorced.

497
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:43,691
There was no wife in the picture.
I was abandoned by my friend.

498
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:49,488
I Iiked him very much.

499
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:54,406
That's not true. I loved him.

500
01:24:57,120 --> 01:24:59,736
We had lived together for five years.

501
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:05,016
You met him at that silly party
at Dr. Wankel's wife's.

502
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:09,928
I suppose you know who I mean?

503
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:13,135
- The actor, Strömberg?
- That's right.

504
01:25:15,640 --> 01:25:21,055
- Now we're just friends.
- Why did you separate?

505
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:31,926
In our cruel market, the unfaithfulness is
total and the competition terrible.

506
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:37,934
Wankel's wife gave much better terms.

507
01:25:38,240 --> 01:25:42,609
She accepted his new friend and
agreed to support them.

508
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:47,092
- She's wealthy, as you know.
- Wasn't he very fond of you?

509
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:49,209
I think he was.

510
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:56,212
But he is beautiful, talented and a little spoilt
and I suppose he needed something different.

511
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:02,256
So I was too painful with my feelings
and my jealousy.

512
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:07,735
Sleep a while?

513
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:17,491
- What time is it?
- 01:30. Almost break of dawn.

514
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:20,051
Mom! Dad! Help!

515
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:26,974
When I was young, I knew that death
frightened me.

516
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:36,493
It was always present.
It surrounded me.

517
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:46,966
My dog was run over. That was
nearly the worst.

518
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:55,773
Mom and dad died in a car crash.
Well, I've already told you.

519
01:29:57,680 --> 01:30:01,172
A cousin died of polio. I was 14.

520
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:06,496
We had been kissing at the dinner
table on a Saturday.

521
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:09,816
Next Friday, he was dead.

522
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:14,815
You've always been considered
a miracle of mental health.

523
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:25,211
Before I got married, I lived a
long while with a crazy artist.

524
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:30,729
When he got very upset, he said:

525
01:30:31,480 --> 01:30:36,406
"Your frigidity is so total that
it interests me".

526
01:30:37,680 --> 01:30:42,606
I said: "I'm only frigid with you.
Everyone else makes me come."

527
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:51,380
I was at a party not so long ago,

528
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:56,734
where someone read out a poem
about death and love,

529
01:30:57,280 --> 01:31:02,491
and how they sink into each other.
And surround each other.

530
01:31:07,640 --> 01:31:12,009
I remember mocking that poem.

531
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:19,856
- Quite childish, don't you think?
- Maybe.

532
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:26,286
Dad was so kind.
He was an alcoholic.

533
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:33,211
He would always hug me.
We had it so good.

534
01:31:34,680 --> 01:31:38,571
Mom passed by and said "That's enough
of that mushiness". And grandma said:

535
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:44,207
"Your dad may be nice, but he's a
real lazy bum".

536
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:50,411
Mom agreed with grandma, they helped
despising dad. And got me to join them.

537
01:31:51,480 --> 01:31:57,328
That's how easy it was. Suddenly I was
embarrassed when dad kissed and hugged me.

538
01:31:58,320 --> 01:32:04,088
I was so concerned about
making grandma satisfied.

539
01:32:08,160 --> 01:32:15,726
Then I had my own child.
Anna had a strange scream.

540
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:21,055
It was different from the other kids.
She didn't scream out of anger

541
01:32:21,680 --> 01:32:26,731
or being hungry. It was more
like a real cry.

542
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:34,810
It was heartwrenching. Sometimes I
wanted to hit her because of it.

543
01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:41,970
And sometimes I was lost with tenderness.
But always with myself in my way.

544
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:50,493
A strange, strange, selfish fear. One
shouldn't give oneself away.

545
01:33:02,240 --> 01:33:04,572
And the happiness faded.

546
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:14,174
I remember the first
time I heard mom cry.

547
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:19,213
I was in the bedroom and heard
mom and grandma talking.

548
01:33:19,640 --> 01:33:24,088
Grandma had such a low, strange voice,

549
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:28,252
and suddenly mom screamed. I didn't
know what it was about.

550
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:34,127
I was terribly scared. Mostly because
grandma's voice was so creepy.

551
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:41,491
And I walked into the living room and saw
mom sitting on a chair by the window

552
01:33:42,640 --> 01:33:47,851
and grandma stood in the middle of the room.
When I came in, she turned to me

553
01:33:48,280 --> 01:33:55,368
and stared. It was grandma's
face, yet it wasn't.

554
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:05,332
She looked like an angry dog getting ready
to bite. And I ran into the bedroom

555
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:10,572
and prayed that grandma would get
her old face back

556
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:16,375
and that mom wouldn't cry.
And it's so horrible when

557
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:21,811
faces change so that you
don't recognize them.

558
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:30,334
I can't talk aboutthis.

559
01:34:45,120 --> 01:34:46,815
I don't want to.

560
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:57,813
Give me a shot.
I can't stand it anymore!

561
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:08,655
I feel sick.

562
01:35:17,400 --> 01:35:20,096
I can't go on living with this.

563
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:39,460
Relax now.

564
01:35:41,680 --> 01:35:45,855
You can't wear that dress today!
That's your Sunday dress!

565
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:50,454
You can't manage that.
Let me help you.

566
01:35:53,080 --> 01:35:55,731
Eat what's on your plate.

567
01:35:56,320 --> 01:36:00,256
Painting your lips?
That's not appropriate in this house.

568
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:07,773
You're late again. Can you never
learn to be in time?

569
01:36:08,160 --> 01:36:15,134
You're lazy and spoiled. If you don't behave,
we'll send you to boarding school.

570
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:18,933
There you'll learn to follow rules.

571
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:26,128
You'll be learning from decent people.
People who have tried to live their

572
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:32,374
lives in order and cleanliness. If you
intend to continue your life with

573
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:36,975
me and grandpa, you must
change your behaviour.

574
01:36:38,040 --> 01:36:42,170
You should be grateful! Can't you for
once in your life show some gratitude?

575
01:36:47,200 --> 01:36:52,092
Don't hit me like that!
Don't hit me in the face!

576
01:36:52,920 --> 01:36:57,653
I'll teach you to behave like people.
Stop your crying.

577
01:36:58,080 --> 01:37:00,810
I don't like those tears.

578
01:37:01,240 --> 01:37:05,495
I do as I please! You can't control me!

579
01:37:06,080 --> 01:37:10,494
I hate you, you fucking witch!

580
01:37:19,960 --> 01:37:23,214
I think it's best that
you're in command.

581
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:30,246
I know that you love me and think
you want my best.

582
01:37:30,720 --> 01:37:33,848
I know that I must do as
you say.

583
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:43,613
Why must I always have a
guilty conscience?

584
01:37:55,200 --> 01:38:01,696
I'll ask for your forgiveness.
Forgive me.

585
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:07,296
I know that I've done wrong.
I'm always wrong.

586
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:27,768
Grandma's little girl.

587
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:33,367
We can talk about everything.

588
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:37,856
Everything is safe and
sound with grandma.

589
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:05,616
I'll die if I must
sit in the closet.

590
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:19,693
I'll do whatever you want if I
don't have to sit in the closet.

591
01:39:21,400 --> 01:39:24,494
Please, grandma, please.

592
01:39:26,320 --> 01:39:31,087
I ask you for forgiveness. I can't
live if I must sit in the closet.

593
01:40:25,120 --> 01:40:32,652
How can you lock a child who's
afraid of the dark in a closet?

594
01:40:34,400 --> 01:40:37,972
- lsn't it surprising?
- Yes, it is.

595
01:40:52,080 --> 01:40:56,892
Do you think I'm emotionally
crippled for life?

596
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:02,413
Do you think we're a one million army
of emotionally crippled people,

597
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:07,852
wretches who wander around,
shouting to each others

598
01:41:08,280 --> 01:41:13,331
with words we don't understand and
that make us even more scared?

599
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:17,053
I don't know.

600
01:41:20,640 --> 01:41:24,497
- There is an invocation for us who don't believe.
- What do you mean?

601
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:29,854
- Sometimes I say it to myself quietly.
- Can you tell it to me?

602
01:41:34,360 --> 01:41:37,932
I wish that someone or
something will strike me,

603
01:41:38,240 --> 01:41:40,652
so I can become real.

604
01:41:41,400 --> 01:41:45,769
I repeat over and over,
may I some day be real.

605
01:41:47,800 --> 01:41:50,086
What do you mean by "real"?

606
01:41:53,440 --> 01:42:00,050
To hear a human voice and trust that it
comes from a human who is made like me...

607
01:42:02,360 --> 01:42:09,368
to touch a pair of lips and at the same
time know that it is a pair of lips.

608
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:17,690
- Sorry to disturb you...
- It's the middle of the night.

609
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:21,128
- The middle of the night?
- My clock shows 04:05.

610
01:42:21,720 --> 01:42:24,086
In the infirmary, it's 08:05.

611
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:27,292
- But it's Tuesday?
- That's right.

612
01:42:28,440 --> 01:42:32,968
Dr. Isaksson's daughter is out there.
She wants to see her mother.

613
01:42:34,400 --> 01:42:39,736
I want to talk to her, but not here.
Could we sit in the visitor's room?

614
01:42:40,320 --> 01:42:45,371
Of course. Some old major's wife has been making
herself at home there, but she's gone for a walk.

615
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:47,854
I must clean up a little.

616
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:53,460
I think we can send Mrs. Isaksson
home today, if she wants to.

617
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:57,856
- Shouldn't we contact Dr. Wankel?
- Not necessary.

618
01:43:02,480 --> 01:43:08,897
Maybe you'd like a breakfast tray in the waiting
room? Your daughter might want a cup of coffee.

619
01:43:09,720 --> 01:43:11,130
Thank you.

620
01:43:22,720 --> 01:43:24,335
Will I see you?

621
01:43:24,640 --> 01:43:27,211
That would be nice. But
it might take some time.

622
01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:30,250
- Why is that?
- I'm going to Jamaica.

623
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:34,646
- You didn't say a word.
- I forgot to tell you.

624
01:43:35,640 --> 01:43:40,851
- I'll have to take care of myself...
- I'm the one who will take care of myself.

625
01:43:43,320 --> 01:43:45,686
I might come with you.

626
01:43:46,680 --> 01:43:50,411
- No thanks.
- What will you do in Jamaica?

627
01:43:51,200 --> 01:43:54,727
I've heard that you can
live amorally in Jamaica.

628
01:43:57,680 --> 01:44:01,696
- Will you come back?
- I can't promise you that.

629
01:44:06,320 --> 01:44:09,050
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

630
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:13,374
Take care of yourself...

631
01:44:14,400 --> 01:44:17,210
and the people who like you.

632
01:44:36,400 --> 01:44:37,526
Hi, mom.

633
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:48,212
Dad called and said you were ill,
so I thought I'd come and visit you

634
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:52,656
- though he said I shouldn't.
- Did he say why I'm here?

635
01:44:53,200 --> 01:44:57,216
He said that you were ill and taken
to the hospital by ambulance.

636
01:44:57,760 --> 01:44:59,887
- Not the reason?
- No.

637
01:45:02,560 --> 01:45:04,414
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

638
01:45:04,720 --> 01:45:08,087
- Should I close the door?
- Yes. Let's sit down.

639
01:45:09,240 --> 01:45:11,606
- Would you like some?
- No.

640
01:45:12,760 --> 01:45:14,091
No thanks.

641
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:23,766
This won't be easy...
Not for you nor for me.

642
01:45:30,720 --> 01:45:33,530
I did something very stupid.

643
01:45:40,400 --> 01:45:42,732
I tried to kill myself.

644
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:52,252
It's difficult to explain.

645
01:45:54,880 --> 01:46:00,409
You might get the idea that
I don't like you, or dad.

646
01:46:02,360 --> 01:46:04,248
But you mustn't.

647
01:46:08,240 --> 01:46:11,129
I like you most of all people.

648
01:46:12,320 --> 01:46:15,608
You and grandma. And dad.

649
01:46:24,320 --> 01:46:27,926
Have you never done
anything suddenly

650
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:32,246
- without knowing why?
- I guess.

651
01:46:37,280 --> 01:46:41,046
- You must try to forgive me.
- I don't understand.

652
01:46:55,040 --> 01:46:58,771
- Are you going back to the riding camp?
- The train leaves in an hour.

653
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:03,128
- Do you have money?
- Yes.

654
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:06,330
- Are you having a good time?
- Kind of.

655
01:47:06,840 --> 01:47:09,047
Say hello to Lena and Karin.

656
01:47:12,120 --> 01:47:15,772
- Are you coming home on Friday?
- Yes.

657
01:47:19,760 --> 01:47:22,615
Couldn't we have dinner together?

658
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:28,689
You pass by here on the way to Skåne.
You come in to town

659
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:33,534
and then the train doesn't leave
until ten.

660
01:47:34,400 --> 01:47:39,690
We could have dinner and go to the movies.
Wouldn't that be nice?

661
01:47:42,840 --> 01:47:44,250
Mom...

662
01:47:45,880 --> 01:47:47,609
Will you do this again?

663
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:52,168
- No.
- How do I know?

664
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:57,047
- You'll have to trust what I say.
- But do you know what you're saying?

665
01:47:58,360 --> 01:48:02,296
- Yes. I think so.
- But you're not sure?

666
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:10,968
What do you really want?
Don't you understand anything?

667
01:48:15,320 --> 01:48:17,129
You never liked me anyway.

668
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:25,376
And that's true.

669
01:48:27,120 --> 01:48:28,735
I have to go now.

670
01:48:32,920 --> 01:48:35,730
Don't worry. I can
take care of myself.

671
01:49:08,920 --> 01:49:12,333
- Are you feeling better?
- Much better.

672
01:49:13,760 --> 01:49:17,696
- Why didn't you say anything?
- There was nothing to say.

673
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:26,769
I asked Dr. Jacobi and he said
that you were stressed out.

674
01:49:27,200 --> 01:49:30,727
- Yes.
- And Eric who rushed home.

675
01:49:31,200 --> 01:49:34,328
- But he went back just as fast.
- Yes, of course.

676
01:49:34,880 --> 01:49:38,088
When he understood that
it wasn't dangerous.

677
01:49:39,320 --> 01:49:41,686
That you were just stressed out.

678
01:49:44,760 --> 01:49:47,729
You're tired.
Shall I make the bed

679
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,776
- so that you can rest?
- No thanks.

680
01:49:51,320 --> 01:49:54,972
But if you're stressed out you
should go away for a while.

681
01:49:55,440 --> 01:50:00,651
It's impossible now. Erneman isn't
coming home for two months.

682
01:50:01,600 --> 01:50:04,660
Then Eric and I might go on vacation.

683
01:50:15,920 --> 01:50:19,253
How are you, grandma?

684
01:50:22,040 --> 01:50:24,531
In some way...

685
01:50:25,240 --> 01:50:29,176
I sense that grandpa won't
be walking again.

686
01:50:37,040 --> 01:50:39,053
That's the way it is.

687
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:46,130
We have waited for this
for several years.

688
01:50:52,280 --> 01:50:54,976
Yet it feels strange...

689
01:50:56,440 --> 01:50:58,488
when it finally happens.

690
01:51:02,800 --> 01:51:05,007
That's the way it is...

691
01:51:13,600 --> 01:51:15,249
I'll go in to see him now.

692
01:51:39,200 --> 01:51:42,488
I stood at the door
for a long time...

693
01:51:43,040 --> 01:51:47,249
looking at the old couple and
their connection...

694
01:51:50,520 --> 01:51:57,528
I saw their slow movements towards the secretive
and horiffic point where they must part.

695
01:52:03,640 --> 01:52:07,929
I saw their dignity.
Their humility.

696
01:52:11,840 --> 01:52:17,460
For a short moment I realised
that love surrounds everything.

697
01:52:19,920 --> 01:52:21,649
Even death.

698
01:53:07,960 --> 01:53:11,452
Give me infirmary 11,
sister Gunnel.

699
01:53:15,360 --> 01:53:18,011
Good day, it's Dr. Isaksson.

700
01:53:19,680 --> 01:53:23,093
Yes, thank you. Tell Dr.
Wankel that I'll be in

701
01:53:23,480 --> 01:53:26,176
at 7:30 tomorrow as usual.

702
01:53:27,680 --> 01:53:29,375
Thank you.
