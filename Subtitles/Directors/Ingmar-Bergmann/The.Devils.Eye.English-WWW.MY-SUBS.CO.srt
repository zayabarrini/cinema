DIGITALLY RESTORED IN 2016

2
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:03,979
"A woman's chastity is a sty
in the Devil's eye"

3
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,521
IRISH PROVERB

4
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:22,497
THE DEVIL'S EYE

5
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:27,661
A Rondo Capriccioso by

6
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:14,875
Ladies and gentlemen,

7
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:20,134
I apologize,
but we must briefly discuss hell.

8
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:23,508
Hell is shaped like a funnel.

9
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:28,347
At the bottom are the first sinners
whose torments are perhaps finished.

10
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,920
Then the other levels of hell,
layered one on top of the other.

11
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,601
And at the top, closest to earth,
lies our own inferno,

12
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:39,032
constructed by Christendom's
brightest and most pompous minds.

13
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:42,110
This inverted parish is run by Satan,

14
00:02:42,204 --> 00:02:45,038
who has taken shape
in all stages of human development,

15
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:47,456
constantly recreated,
constantly renewed, rejuvenated,

16
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,249
and more and more human...

17
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:51,828
I almost said spiritualized.

18
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:56,417
Here begins our comedy.

19
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:04,136
<i>Satan has a pain in his eye.</i>

20
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:06,263
<i>Maybe it's a sty.</i>

21
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:08,436
<i>There are only two possibilities.</i>

22
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:13,483
<i>Either he was sitting in a draft,
which is virtually impossible in hell,</i>

23
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:16,811
<i>or something alarming
has happened on earth.</i>

24
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:21,275
<i>For that reason,
he sends for his main advisers,</i>

25
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:23,109
<i>Count Armand de Rochefoucauld,</i>

26
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:26,446
<i>and Marquis Giuseppe Maria
de Macopanza.</i>

27
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,449
<i>It should also be mentioned</i>

28
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:32,957
<i>that in his time, the Count
was a prominent politician and poisoner</i>

29
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:36,756
<i>with deep insight into Gregorian chant.</i>

30
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:39,300
<i>The Marquis was ofsuch noble blood</i>

31
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:44,097
<i>that his perversions sent sensual shivers
all the way up to the archangel's quills</i>

32
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:47,641
<i>and all the way down
into hell's finest districts.</i>

33
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:58,855
If the matter weren't so serious,
I'd be inclined to find it stimulating.

34
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:03,362
We must get to the root of the evil,
the sty in our master's eye.

35
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:06,115
Certainly, my dear Marquis.

36
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,287
And it is?

37
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:10,490
A young woman's innocence, Master.

38
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,871
A tremendous challenge for hell.

39
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:15,499
Twenty years old.
Beautiful as a spring day.

40
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:18,798
Healthy, intelligent,
good physique and beautiful teeth.

41
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:20,341
Engaged.

42
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,544
And still a virgin.

43
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:24,299
Still.

44
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,303
The situation is more than precarious.

45
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:30,009
If this woman enters
her marriage undefiled

46
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,811
it will have unforeseeable consequences.

47
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:36,687
Heaven will rejoice.
Archangels will play trumpets.

48
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,484
It'll be a godly racket.

49
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,232
Spare me.

50
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:43,565
I must also emphasize the dangerous
power of setting an example.

51
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,695
The young woman has girlfriends.

52
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:49,279
What happens if one-by-one,
they follow her example?

53
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,488
What happens?

54
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:53,325
Integrity, order, monogamy.

55
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,159
Perhaps happy marriages.

56
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,370
Let's not exaggerate, dear Count.

57
00:04:57,464 --> 00:05:01,504
Marriage is hell's mainstay.

58
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:04,176
Our pièce de résistance.

59
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:08,597
You're right.
What would hell be without marriage?

60
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,549
I'm in pain, gentlemen.

61
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,769
Something must be done.

62
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:17,940
You're absolutely right, Master.
Something must be done.

63
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:21,519
Undoubtedly, something must be done.

64
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:26,115
Satan has his fine moments, gentlemen.

65
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:28,071
Admit it.

66
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:37,331
The greater the innocence,
the closer at hand lurks evil.

67
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,914
Here in hell we have plenty of weapons

68
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:44,717
to aim and fire
at this young woman's breast.

69
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:49,548
To name a few, Francesco da Pisa,
who raped and killed 1,800 nuns.

70
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:52,884
And Count Berthold zum Felsenstein
and Schwarzen Ferkel,

71
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:58,019
whose potency increased the population
of Silesia by several thousand.

72
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,563
And yet

73
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,612
all of this is nothing...

74
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,825
compared to the artist,

75
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,202
the fanatic...

76
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,786
the dreamer...

77
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:19,160
the great...

78
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,582
Don Juan.

79
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,381
Good morning, Master.

80
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,634
How are you doing?

81
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:38,472
Since you've given me my sleep back
I've felt great, thank you.

82
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:41,808
- And the dreams?
- I endure them.

83
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:45,437
- Otherwise, you're satisfied?
- I'm completely satisfied.

84
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,864
My only concern
is that I've become so fragile.

85
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,158
It feels as if my insides
have burned away,

86
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:54,863
and my skin is a thin shell
around utter emptiness.

87
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:58,870
- There's a long way to go, Don Juan.
- Yes, Master. I know.

88
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,872
And your punishment?

89
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:03,045
I don't want to complain, Master.

90
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,544
But I find my punishment boring.

91
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:07,296
Almost unworthy of me.

92
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:11,546
It's painful, like a toothache,
but hardly unbearable.

93
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,178
If you'll excuse me.

94
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,678
Naturally.

95
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,513
Pablo!

96
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,232
Yes!

97
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,811
Coming.

98
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:35,570
- Do you have a cold, Pablo?
- It's the smoke, Master.

99
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:38,327
I've slept and need to powder.
Get my violet robe.

100
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,123
Yes, Master.

101
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:47,836
- Today's first punishment is waiting.
- Did you recognize her?

102
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:51,340
She wore a veil, but I suspect you'll
recognize her if you loosen her skirt.

103
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:54,718
Pablo, you've said the same stupid thing
every day for 300 years.

104
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,515
I beg you, say something different.

105
00:07:56,601 --> 00:08:00,185
You know it's forbidden, Master.
Everything must be as it's always been.

106
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,103
You're right, I forgive you.

107
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,683
Let in the beauty, I'm ready.

108
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:09,612
- Could you tell if she was crying?
- By the devil, she was.

109
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:11,735
Women live in a storm of moisture.

110
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:14,693
If it's not wet in one place,
it's pouring in another.

111
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:18,951
They must have gills.
A man would drown in so much salt water.

112
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,158
By the way, it's amazing
it even happens in this dry air,

113
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,620
but hell has it's caprices,

114
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:30,379
and a woman's tears are more painful
than molten lead in your belly button.

115
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:33,085
There we go. Now you're beautiful, Master.

116
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,546
You're made up like an old prostitute

117
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,428
and ready to enjoy your punishment
with beauty intact.

118
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,975
You...

119
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:50,311
Don Juan, I'm sure you didn't
expect me at such an early hour.

120
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:51,941
Whenever it pleases.

121
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:55,616
I'm amazed you're not in the arms
of some all-too-willing hussy.

122
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,568
Madam, I assure you.

123
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:01,121
Presumably your servant,
that swine in human form,

124
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,995
has already sent your nighttime
companion into a side chamber.

125
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:06,293
My dear, how could you think that?

126
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:10,248
Don Juan, I've come to kill you.

127
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:23,603
You're brave, Don Juan.
And you play your game.

128
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,064
I'll only say that you provide me
with enjoyment, Madam.

129
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:30,484
My chest shall open up
for your little dagger

130
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,436
with the same soft readiness

131
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,864
that your womb opened up
for my love's sharp blade.

132
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:39,322
I beg you.
Grant us this ultimate indulgence.

133
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:42,788
The only pleasure
our bodies have not yet tasted.

134
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:48,120
I give you my death, Madam,
as I gave you my life.

135
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,839
And I command you
to consummate this sacrificial act,

136
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:56,420
which shall forever purify our love
in a river of blood and tears.

137
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,346
My vision fades, Don Juan.

138
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:02,891
Tiny flames of silver emanate
from your mouth and burn me.

139
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,138
Give me your hand.

140
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:11,650
My precious. My beloved.

141
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:14,103
Rest a moment on the bed.

142
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:16,530
No, Don Juan.

143
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:20,656
Drink this wine and regain your hatred.

144
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:23,488
You're breathing so heavily,
your breast must be freed.

145
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:26,494
I want to help you.
Let me kiss your forehead.

146
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,416
No, Don Juan.

147
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:30,335
Don't put away your dagger, my love.

148
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:32,913
Don't forget your humiliation
and your hatred.

149
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:34,873
I'm burning, Don Juan.

150
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:37,005
It's your hatred that's burning.

151
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:40,463
I want to cool you off,
free you from your clothes.

152
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,467
I love you, Don Juan.

153
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:50,815
The show is over, Don Juan.

154
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:57,146
The show is over, Don Juan.

155
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:07,865
In a short while,
the next woman will arrive.

156
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:10,076
And the same scene will repeat again.

157
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,537
The same scene and the same ending.

158
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:16,419
The old demon appears and says,
"The show is over, Don Juan."

159
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:20,382
I have a proposition for you, Don Juan.

160
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:22,383
You may accept or decline.

161
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:26,259
It's hell that truly practices free will.

162
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,309
I'm listening.

163
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:31,647
Look at this photo, Don Juan.

164
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,563
I'm offering you a trip to earth,

165
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:38,771
to rob this young woman of her virginity,

166
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:42,449
of her purity and of her faith in love.

167
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,743
What say the higher powers?

168
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,245
When it comes
to a young woman's innocence,

169
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:53,078
the angels' <i>naïveté</i> is limitless.

170
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,622
You ought to know.

171
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,674
Earth, Don Juan.

172
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:02,253
One evening, one night, one morning.

173
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:06,215
All the power of hell at your back.

174
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:10,974
What is a young woman's virtue
before our combined onslaught?

175
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:17,977
I'll deduct 300 years from your sentence,
Don Juan,

176
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:22,907
and place you in a merciful slumber
without heaven's knowledge.

177
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:30,331
A sleep without dreams, Don Juan.

178
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,499
Can Pablo come along?

179
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:35,290
Pablo can go with you.

180
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:40,375
Pablo, would you like to go to earth
for a short visit?

181
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:43,961
I'll be damned. Are you kidding?

182
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:48,049
The earthly paradise. That's my paradise.

183
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:51,681
I'll enjoy it like a fool
enjoys his own innards.

184
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:55,310
- You understand we'll be alive?
- Exactly, Master.

185
00:12:56,317 --> 00:13:00,027
I'm going to taste life,
smack it between my lips.

186
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:03,322
I'll devour as much as I can.

187
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:04,819
Then it's settled.

188
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:10,161
My eye feels better already.

189
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:33,071
In all humility, the Marquis and I
have researched various methods

190
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:36,328
of seducing young women
in this Nordic land.

191
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:39,910
We found that a sudden attack

192
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:44,339
is more recommendable
than a prolonged siege.

193
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:49,090
The seducer should use affection
paired with relentless determination

194
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:52,469
leaving no room for doubt in the subject.

195
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:53,594
We can manage that.

196
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:57,928
A hint of unexaggerated southern vivacity,

197
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,605
a purity and moderation
in manner and behavior

198
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:04,184
inspires trust in the subject.

199
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,940
We've got that.

200
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:11,116
A romantic, elegiac tone,
a touch of endured pain,

201
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:15,446
awakens and stimulates the imagination
and sympathy in the subject.

202
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,452
We're close to brilliant there.

203
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:22,788
Any comment suggesting
emotional coldness or perversion

204
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,042
is strictly prohibited.

205
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:27,500
Who do they think we are?

206
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,802
However,
cynicism based on a wounded idealism

207
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,722
is to be considered, even recommended.

208
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:35,470
Finally, the young Nordic woman

209
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:39,144
is extremely sensitive
to a loving and refined tone,

210
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,222
preferably with a foreign accent.

211
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:44,058
A manly physique and beauty
is obviously a plus,

212
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:46,860
but strangely enough, not necessary.

213
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,654
The Nordic woman
is unaccustomed to compliments

214
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:54,485
and you should therefore cautiously
praise her physical assets or attire.

215
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:59,074
If the seducer is overly enthusiastic,
the subject will think he's lying

216
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:02,205
and the game is up.

217
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,706
To summarize:

218
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:09,425
The Nordic woman is passionate,
surprising, and independent.

219
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:13,595
She's loyal and romantic,
but ruthless in her passion.

220
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:16,173
She often gets cold feet.

221
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:18,884
To confuse her unabashed
immodesty with frivolity

222
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,186
would be a disastrous underestimation.

223
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:23,355
She is inexperienced, but curious.

224
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:27,185
In summer, she's accessible.
In winter, she wears a lot of clothes.

225
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:30,771
The Nordic woman is
rarely aware of her femininity.

226
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:32,902
Therefore, she's easy prey.

227
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:39,239
Her morals are inscrutable,
therefore she's difficult to keep.

228
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:44,793
There are those who believe
that God is dead,

229
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:46,541
that he perhaps never existed,

230
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:50,291
that Heaven is empty
and eternity is out of reach.

231
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:54,212
They also believe that evil
just functions coldly

232
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:56,217
like the other laws of nature

233
00:16:56,307 --> 00:17:00,221
and that goodness is one of mankind's
most inexplicable perversions.

234
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:05,306
Such opinions undoubtedly make
an excellent foundation for a tragedy,

235
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,561
but this evening
we're performing a comedy,

236
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:10,395
and therefore the world
must be seen differently.

237
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:12,980
Accordingly, hell is in the underworld.

238
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:16,658
God and his angels reside
in the seven heavens.

239
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:20,738
In between these two realms
lies mankind's earth

240
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:23,619
in all its splendor and wealth.

241
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:28,579
<i>Into the sunlit autumn world of our comedy</i>

242
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:32,087
<i>arrives Don Juan with his servant, Pablo.</i>

243
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:34,338
<i>They emerge from a dried-up well,</i>

244
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:40,425
<i>which bottomlessly extends towards
hell's mazes and secret elevators.</i>

245
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:45,513
<i>Dazed and blinded by the sun,
they behold the earthly paradise.</i>

246
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:57,074
Look, Master. Trees. Flowers. And clouds.

247
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,949
More trees.

248
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:04,702
Grass. Water. Birds.

249
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:09,290
Look over there.
More trees, grass and flowers.

250
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:15,171
- What are you doing here?
- That's a good question.

251
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:19,221
I'm supposed to ensure your safety,
my little ones.

252
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:21,845
So you have Satan's trust?

253
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,596
Completely.

254
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:30,024
I'm one of the oldest and cruelest devils
in hell's upper and lower levels.

255
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:34,479
"You're so evil I don't know
what to do with you," he usually says.

256
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:38,566
But he says it lovingly.

257
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,200
What was it I was supposed to say...

258
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,244
Yes, yes.

259
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:47,871
I'm supposed to make sure
you gentlemen carry out your mission.

260
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:50,210
I'll be damned.

261
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:53,880
Satan confided in me...

262
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:57,585
I mean, Satan specifically asked me

263
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:00,921
to take care of little Pablo.

264
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:05,885
"No fun with the ladies," he said.
"I won't tolerate it."

265
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:12,308
My sense of humor is also limited.

266
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:16,403
I'll find some clever way to fool you.

267
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:20,866
Yeah, you can try.

268
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,158
Quiet.

269
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,578
Now we encounter one of those situations

270
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:29,079
humans so casually call
"a stroke of good fortune."

271
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,411
Here comes the vicar in his car.

272
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:35,839
I'll disappear.
I have to see to the engine trouble.

273
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:43,527
It's like I always say,
"The Lord looks after his own."

274
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:45,609
The first time I ever have engine trouble

275
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:49,993
and suddenly two helpful angels appear
as if sent from above.

276
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,539
That's how it always is.

277
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:55,209
My life is just a series
of fortunate accidents.

278
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:58,539
It's like the Devil and his minions
tuck in their tails and run

279
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,840
as soon as I appear.

280
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,883
The vicar is unmarried, I take it?

281
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,632
Quite the opposite.

282
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:08,507
My wife is intelligent and beautiful.

283
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:11,810
Personally, I'm not the brightest,
to tell you the truth,

284
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:16,311
but I have a good heart and I'm gullible,

285
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,517
so it evens out.

286
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:20,898
Does the vicar have any dau...
any children?

287
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:23,571
Just one daughter.

288
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:29,529
But she's the apple of my eye,
a rose of Sharon, if you catch my drift.

289
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:32,326
She's about to be married.

290
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,533
Yes, yes, yes.

291
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:37,495
He's a good lad.
Educated as an agronomist.

292
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:40,706
We couldn't ask for a better son-in-law.

293
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,008
He's going to lease the land
belonging to the church

294
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:45,176
so the young couple will be living nearby.

295
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:47,629
That's a blessing.

296
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,178
You gentlemen must come
to the vicarage for dinner.

297
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:53,385
We'll enjoy a pleasant evening together.

298
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:56,472
We couldn't possibly refuse
such a gracious invitation.

299
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:17,459
A heartfelt welcome, gentlemen.
A heartfelt welcome to the vicarage.

300
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:30,468
Natan, dear.

301
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:32,925
Natan, dear. I have guests.

302
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:41,058
Renata isn't feeling well.

303
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:43,643
Her health has been poor
these last few years.

304
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:46,320
But she'd like you to come in
and say hello.

305
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,274
Come in.

306
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:54,287
These are my friends and benefactors,
dear Renata.

307
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,615
They're staying for dinner.

308
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,792
It should be a pleasant evening.

309
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,582
- Good day.
- Good day.

310
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:03,288
I understand it's not a good time.

311
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,795
On the contrary,
I was just dying of boredom.

312
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:07,922
You've saved me. At least for tonight.

313
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:09,844
There you go.

314
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,671
My poor husband is overjoyed.

315
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:15,759
He worries that our lives here
are boring and dull.

316
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:17,094
My wife writes poetry.

317
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:18,849
Just to pass the time.

318
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:21,810
I hope we get a chance to hear some.

319
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:27,480
No, you definitely won't.

320
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:30,782
You have to take care of your guests.

321
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:33,326
Now let me introduce you to our daughter.

322
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:36,868
I guarantee you'll fall in love with her
right away.

323
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:38,698
I'm sure of it.

324
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:41,455
Good-bye, dear Natan. We'll soon return.

325
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:10,147
One of my predecessors...
He's there on the wall, actually.

326
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:15,152
He was a very original man
with deep insight on most issues.

327
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:17,407
One night,
he was visited by a devil from hell,

328
00:24:17,498 --> 00:24:20,912
who offered his services in exchange
for the usual indemnification.

329
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:23,744
- Do you know what the vicar did?
- I have no idea.

330
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:27,831
He tricked the little devil
into this cabinet and locked it.

331
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,671
You can see for yourself.

332
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:33,128
The door is even burned on the inside.

333
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:35,930
And what do you keep in there?

334
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:48,352
My dear wife doesn't know I drink,
so I have to do it in secret.

335
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:51,989
You're probably wondering
why I'm telling you this.

336
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:56,196
I'd like to have my own devil
in the cabinet.

337
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:59,324
He would certainly have to divulge
what he knew.

338
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:01,990
Cheers.

339
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:10,127
Forgive us, dear Renata.

340
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:12,550
But it's both tasty and cleansing.

341
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,886
Now let's go find Britt-Marie.

342
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:37,613
Come in.

343
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:57,755
If you don't get out of my bed
immediately, I'll call my husband.

344
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:05,265
I beg you.

345
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:07,438
Think of my reputation.

346
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:10,275
The scandal.

347
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:14,237
And what the servants would say.

348
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:43,551
This is my bed, and I won't leave it
just because a clod of a man hops into it.

349
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:55,737
Why are you blowing on my neck?

350
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:59,361
You have the loveliest peach fuzz
on your neck

351
00:27:00,244 --> 00:27:03,203
and I'm trying to blow your hair aside
to see it better.

352
00:27:04,248 --> 00:27:07,082
I'm aroused by its splendor.

353
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:13,130
Are you aware that you have
an unusually ugly and strange nose?

354
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:16,457
Whatever it reminds me of.

355
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:22,176
And you have a very particular mouth,
whatever it reminds me of.

356
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:30,263
Your scent is driving me mad.

357
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:32,557
Did you know that?

358
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:49,245
Let's postpone what we intend to do
for a while, Renata.

359
00:27:49,877 --> 00:27:52,711
Offer some resistance, if it pleases you.

360
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:55,709
It'll increase our pleasure.
No, don't say a word.

361
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,461
I know everything.

362
00:27:57,551 --> 00:27:59,634
I can read it in your eyes.

363
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:04,051
Your wisdom, your strong character,

364
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:08,886
your femininity, your tenderness,
your frail health.

365
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:10,470
Everything.

366
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:16,231
Everything forbids you to let yourself go
in an inevitable embrace.

367
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,320
Really?

368
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:19,396
Everything forbids you, I say.

369
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:23,776
But there is a dark spot in your spirit,
Renata.

370
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:24,905
Really?

371
00:28:24,995 --> 00:28:30,741
A dark spot of uncontrollable sensuality,
pent up for too long.

372
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:34,248
It's only in your dreams
that you give it free rein,

373
00:28:34,338 --> 00:28:36,796
and give in to pleasure.

374
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:39,625
- You're certain of that?
- Hold out a little longer, Renata.

375
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:42,051
Just a short while.

376
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:47,097
- Where was I?
- In my dreams.

377
00:28:47,184 --> 00:28:52,600
That's right. In your dreams
you enjoy limitless pleasure,

378
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:56,683
until it reaches the point
of pain and shame.

379
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:01,028
Where do you get all this from?

380
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:04,152
A thing or two has stuck
throughout the years,

381
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:07,156
and I have great role models.

382
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:12,870
But inspiration is always
the most important,

383
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,124
and now my soul is so inspired
I can barely stand up straight.

384
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:18,296
You're tired.

385
00:29:18,382 --> 00:29:20,795
Yes, I'm tired.

386
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:24,878
The blood in my legs is boiling
and my stomach is full of butterflies.

387
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:26,679
No.

388
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:45,986
Come in, come in.

389
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:48,860
- Hi.
- Hi.

390
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:50,616
Good day.

391
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:55,037
Jonas and I made a bet
that all the doors and windows

392
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:57,164
would be painted when he returns tomorrow.

393
00:29:57,254 --> 00:29:58,870
He doesn't think I'll make it.

394
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:02,503
They wallpapered and painted
everything on their own.

395
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:05,835
- Welcome to my home, I should say.
- A great honor.

396
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:08,592
Look at that. A real hostess in her house.

397
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:11,766
And you're the first guest. A good omen.

398
00:30:11,852 --> 00:30:16,062
Can you believe it, Britt-Marie?
The car broke down and suddenly, as if...

399
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:18,686
Dad, I forgot.
You're supposed to call the Berglunds.

400
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:20,516
They've been waiting for you since 3:00.

401
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,852
Oh, dear God, you've made me forgetful.

402
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:25,609
I better hurry.

403
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:30,068
Farewell, my friends. Take care.

404
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:35,448
Having a dining room is damn conservative,
don't you agree?

405
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:38,080
Jonas thinks we should make
that room a dining room.

406
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:40,753
I want to make it a nursery.
Come take a look.

407
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,628
This room faces southwest.

408
00:30:44,718 --> 00:30:48,712
You can't imagine a better nursery.
Sun all day.

409
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:52,389
- But Jonas wants a dining room.
- And who's winning?

410
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:55,890
Until kids come, he gets what he wants.
Then it's me who decides.

411
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:57,891
Dare I ask how many?

412
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:00,064
Jonas wants at least four.

413
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:02,858
But if it's up to me,
we'll have at least a dozen.

414
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:07,446
Do you have any children?

415
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:10,862
Why are you smiling?

416
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:13,740
I was wondering why
you're observing me with such acuity.

417
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,539
I was comparing you to Jonas.

418
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:19,834
And that comparison fell in his favor?

419
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,128
Of course. Want to see the kitchen?

420
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:24,668
I'll gladly see the kitchen,
if it pleases you.

421
00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:26,750
It's mostly done.

422
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:28,800
Beautiful, isn't it?

423
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,925
Look how these old copper bowls shine.

424
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:35,474
And that old clock with the roses
was from my grandma.

425
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:40,351
The floor has these practical tiles,
but I've forgotten what they're called.

426
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,432
Look at all the cupboard space.

427
00:31:42,526 --> 00:31:46,440
Jonas did all the carpentry on his own.
Not bad, eh?

428
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:47,862
What a guy.

429
00:31:47,948 --> 00:31:50,611
Yes, he's really extraordinary.

430
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:56,617
He's so calm, firm and manly,
even though he's only 25.

431
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:58,948
Almost like a father.

432
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:01,830
- It must be wonderful.
- Yes, it is wonderful.

433
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,128
He's really gifted in mathematics as well.

434
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:06,627
He can figure out anything
on his slide rule.

435
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:08,799
And if he forgets it at home?

436
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:10,842
Jonas never forgets anything.

437
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,795
- And you love him?
- Yes.

438
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:15,848
We've loved each other
since I was 13 and he was 18.

439
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,204
- We got engaged back then.
- And now you're getting married?

440
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:20,140
Yes, we are.

441
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:22,973
It's so reassuring to have
a strong person by your side.

442
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:25,649
You get to be as weak as you want.

443
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:27,226
Don't you ever argue?

444
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,983
Oh, yes. Sometimes I get angry, of course,

445
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:33,157
but then he explains my reactions
and I calm down.

446
00:32:33,243 --> 00:32:35,485
Jonas really understands human nature.

447
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:37,036
He has no faults?

448
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:40,661
Oh, yes. He slurps while eating,
and he doesn't like to wash his feet.

449
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:44,164
But he's extremely clean.
And they're not really character flaws.

450
00:32:44,254 --> 00:32:45,916
Congratulations on such a man.

451
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:48,669
Thank you. I'm very proud of him.

452
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:51,876
- You'll be a happy wife.
- Yes, that's for sure.

453
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,882
And now I get to see the bedroom.

454
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:56,339
No, you don't get to see that.

455
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,560
Close your eyes.

456
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:04,229
Do as I say. Shut your eyes.

457
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:07,975
Now, describe me.

458
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:13,940
Blue eyes, light hair, a graceful nose,
a mouth for kisses,

459
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:17,903
caressing hands, firm breasts, round hips,
and a womb made for love...

460
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,362
No, stop.

461
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:21,038
Are you hurt?

462
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:24,538
We've just met each other,
and you're talking about my womb.

463
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:26,415
It's not really appropriate.

464
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:28,212
Jonas never talks about it?

465
00:33:28,298 --> 00:33:30,540
That's one question too many.

466
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:31,920
Forgive me.

467
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,546
I forgive you.

468
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:39,215
You've never kissed anyone
other than Jonas?

469
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:43,053
Of course I have, who do you think I am?

470
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:44,978
May I kiss you?

471
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:49,938
Gladly.

472
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,270
You're a real Don Juan, you.

473
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:55,398
Isn't that the truth?

474
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,909
That was really innocent.

475
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:07,959
Now I'm going to kiss you.

476
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:23,134
You're the 37th.

477
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:25,265
- The 37th?
- That I've kissed.

478
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:27,938
I'm planning on reaching 50
before I'm married.

479
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:30,266
Are you experienced with women?

480
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,441
By all means.

481
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:34,111
Of course you're experienced.

482
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:38,157
And I get you to turn pale and tremble.
Me, who doesn't know a thing.

483
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:41,118
There's only one thing I know for sure.

484
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,695
And that is?

485
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:44,701
That I love Jonas,

486
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:47,784
and that nothing
can diminish my love for him.

487
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:51,291
- But you kiss other men?
- I just said that to fool with you.

488
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:55,170
- You kissed me.
- Yes, don't you understand?

489
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:58,970
When I saw your lips,
I wanted to kiss them to see how it felt.

490
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:00,466
And it felt?

491
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:02,514
I've felt it all along.

492
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:07,016
Your voice, your way of looking at me,
I've felt it all.

493
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,812
And then the kiss.

494
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:11,857
- But that doesn't change anything.
- It doesn't change anything?

495
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,060
You see, I love Jonas.

496
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:17,397
I love his kisses, the way he moves,

497
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:20,904
the way he touches me, his tone of voice.

498
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:22,986
That's the difference.

499
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:27,031
You play a dangerous game,
don't you think?

500
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:32,833
Yes, dear God, life would be boring
if you didn't lie from time to time.

501
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:35,042
The strange thing is
that people believe what you say.

502
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:36,548
Like me, for example.

503
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,172
Yes, like you.

504
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:41,254
I don't know, perhaps it's sinful to play.

505
00:35:41,348 --> 00:35:45,092
Jonas always says I mustn't do it.
That it's cruel.

506
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:47,518
But it's so tempting. Especially with men.

507
00:35:47,604 --> 00:35:50,688
They almost beg for it.
"Play with me, lie to me,

508
00:35:50,774 --> 00:35:54,438
say what's untrue
and I promise to believe it all."

509
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:58,149
- You, yourself are impervious?
- Impervious?

510
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:02,700
I never lie to Jonas,
if that's what you mean.

511
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:06,370
Jonas would see through you, of course.

512
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:09,369
I've noticed you're very
sarcastic about Jonas.

513
00:36:09,459 --> 00:36:11,542
You really enjoy it.

514
00:36:11,628 --> 00:36:14,746
I understand that you and Jonas
live by principles.

515
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:18,382
And that principles
are holier than life itself.

516
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:20,209
That was both crude and foolish.

517
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:22,386
Quite the opposite. I sympathize with you.

518
00:36:22,472 --> 00:36:24,930
- I don't think so.
- Sure, I do.

519
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:27,133
Lack of principles has been my principle.

520
00:36:27,227 --> 00:36:30,811
Betrayal my morality, vice my virtue,
debauchery my abstinence,

521
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,889
and godlessness my religion.

522
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:36,859
So when all's said and done,
we're pretty similar, you and I.

523
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:45,492
Did I scare you?

524
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:48,412
Yes, I was scared, but not of you.

525
00:36:48,498 --> 00:36:50,490
For yourself.

526
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:52,950
There's only one thing I know for sure.

527
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:55,502
That you're no ordinary man.

528
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:58,922
That you can wound me deeply.

529
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:01,216
That's my greatest wish.

530
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:05,588
It's surprising.

531
00:37:05,682 --> 00:37:07,344
Surprising?

532
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:12,853
That deep down in my heart
I long for that wound.

533
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:16,686
- But it mustn't happen.
- Of course not.

534
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:18,768
You have to think of your man.

535
00:37:18,862 --> 00:37:21,275
I have to guard my love.

536
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:25,825
Your so-called love is only words,
a young woman's boundless self-love.

537
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:29,946
Your conceit, your reticence,
all your meddlesome, so-called sense,

538
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:32,497
appears in the guise
of a make-believe love.

539
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:35,201
Only those who love
can know anything about it.

540
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:41,791
You speak as a believer of God.

541
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:45,128
Only those who believe in God,
believe in God.

542
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:47,508
But you neither believe nor know.

543
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:50,095
Don't be so sure.

544
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:53,643
It's true that I am incapable of love,

545
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:56,897
but I have seen love up close.

546
00:37:57,567 --> 00:38:00,059
And that's a rare gift?

547
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:03,813
It's a rare gift.

548
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:09,785
Those who know great love are few...

549
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,988
and their suffering is boundless.

550
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,538
I have been told
that they are close to God,

551
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:19,837
and that they are mirrors
reflecting his light,

552
00:38:19,923 --> 00:38:23,507
making life bearable for the rest of us
wretches who fumble in the darkness.

553
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,544
Perhaps that's the case.

554
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:28,630
I don't know anything about it.

555
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:34,928
I've chosen a different path,
a path called contempt and indifference.

556
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:36,387
I don't understand.

557
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:40,516
No, you don't understand.

558
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:47,361
- Don't you ever feel longing?
- No, I don't ever feel longing.

559
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:49,820
Don't you have dreams?

560
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:52,570
No, I have no dreams.

561
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:55,534
Then you're dead.

562
00:38:57,877 --> 00:38:59,334
Yes, that's true.

563
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:05,670
What do you want of me?

564
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:08,919
Do you want to harm?

565
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:11,422
Poison?

566
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:15,718
You want to kill?

567
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:19,055
Jonas!

568
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:23,108
How funny. He wasn't supposed
to be back until tomorrow.

569
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:24,856
Jonas!

570
00:39:47,594 --> 00:39:49,756
So ends the first act.

571
00:39:49,846 --> 00:39:51,929
We have met our characters

572
00:39:52,015 --> 00:39:55,850
and allowed them to take their first steps
in this inconsequential contra dance.

573
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:57,426
Ladies and gentlemen...

574
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,136
I'm sorry. I forgot something.

575
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,096
As many of you might have expected,

576
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:04,479
it's the powers of the underworld
that rule the weather.

577
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:07,562
Satan has now unleashed a heavy rainstorm.

578
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,699
<i>The vicar, concerned for his guests,</i>

579
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:15,619
<i>has accordingly asked them
to stay the night.</i>

580
00:40:15,705 --> 00:40:19,324
<i>Something they,
for easily understood reasons, accepted.</i>

581
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,625
<i>Was there something else?</i>

582
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:26,957
<i>Yes, the black cat has been
invited to partake</i>

583
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:30,168
<i>and is feasting on herring
and milk in the kitchen.</i>

584
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:34,255
<i>The vicar now has three snakes
at his bosom.</i>

585
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:36,966
Autumn has come early this year.

586
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:41,391
In the southern country
where I spent most of my life

587
00:40:41,481 --> 00:40:45,316
autumn storms were always
announced by a yellow-violet cloud

588
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:48,235
that sat on the horizon for seven nights.

589
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:52,148
People said it was a wineskin

590
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:56,235
filled to the brim with God's tears
over mankind's sins.

591
00:40:57,497 --> 00:41:00,740
And when the cloud would finally burst
on the seventh evening

592
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:02,950
the rain was always salty and bitter,

593
00:41:03,753 --> 00:41:05,710
and they would ring all the church bells.

594
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:07,789
How very interesting.

595
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:12,041
Maybe we should open the window
and stick out our tongues

596
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:14,052
to see if God's crying on us tonight.

597
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:16,551
- Don't be silly, Jonas.
- Oops.

598
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,341
Can I have some more cream?

599
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:21,597
By the way, we're getting our pigs.

600
00:41:21,688 --> 00:41:24,351
It's important that they marry
as soon as possible.

601
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,352
Yes, dear Jonas, we can...

602
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:28,434
I have instructions
on how it should be done.

603
00:41:28,528 --> 00:41:30,736
- Interesting, I must say.
- Not now, dear.

604
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:34,236
In the spring, we'll have
an astronomical birthrate on the farm.

605
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:36,908
- I worked it out on my slide rule.
- Please, put that away.

606
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:40,783
- Why?
- Because it's not funny.

607
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:42,364
Not funny?

608
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:44,290
You're the one who's funny.

609
00:41:44,377 --> 00:41:46,369
- That's funny.
- First you call me...

610
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:48,579
- Did I call you?
- Didn't you?

611
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:53,088
You called and told me to come home
to discuss an important matter.

612
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,918
Your voice sounded so strange,

613
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:57,130
but then the phone went dead
before we were finished.

614
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:59,984
- Somebody pulled a prank on you.
- A damn stupid prank, in that case.

615
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:01,971
- Really?
- Yes.

616
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:04,144
There, there.
Now the kids are done bickering

617
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:06,472
and everything is just dandy.

618
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,517
Jonas is so awkward at times.

619
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,312
Shall we adjourn from the table?

620
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:20,452
Lord, thank you for this meal. Amen.

621
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,330
You're being ridiculous.

622
00:42:28,171 --> 00:42:29,252
Jonas.

623
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:32,502
- I'm not the one being ridiculous.
- I'll forgive you, if you forgive me.

624
00:42:32,592 --> 00:42:34,504
Really, you'll forgive me?
How kind of you.

625
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:37,257
- Now I'm really mad.
- By all means.

626
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:40,009
You're ill-mannered and awkward.

627
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:43,934
Rude, unpleasant and arrogant.

628
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:46,307
Rude and ill-mannered
without the slightest manners.

629
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:48,935
- You're really ill-mannered.
- You are...

630
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:50,937
Just say it.

631
00:42:51,027 --> 00:42:54,191
- I can't think of anything.
- Spoiled and selfish.

632
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,237
Don't hold back.

633
00:42:57,075 --> 00:42:59,283
You're spoiled and selfish.

634
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:08,826
We've never argued like this before.

635
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,627
I'm leaving anyway.

636
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:13,877
- Do you have to?
- Yes, I don't want to stay any longer.

637
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:16,800
We'll just find more ways
to be unpleasant to one another.

638
00:43:16,886 --> 00:43:19,378
- And also...
- Say what you're thinking.

639
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:23,890
I've been wondering all night
why you didn't want to kiss me.

640
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:27,720
There's no particular reason.

641
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:30,605
It hurt me somehow.

642
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:38,822
Feel better now?

643
00:43:38,908 --> 00:43:41,150
No, not at all.

644
00:43:41,244 --> 00:43:43,031
Then leave, damn it!

645
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:12,848
It was an autumn evening like this one.

646
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:16,902
There was a full moon
and the air was beginning to cool.

647
00:44:16,988 --> 00:44:21,278
Don Juan had climbed over a tall wall
to elude his pursuers,

648
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:24,110
and he discovered
that he was in a cemetery.

649
00:44:25,955 --> 00:44:29,414
Suddenly in front of him
stood the governor's statue.

650
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,624
He was a noble old man
that he had recently killed in a duel.

651
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:39,466
Our guest has just told us
he's working on a biography of Don Juan.

652
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:43,716
Well...

653
00:44:44,724 --> 00:44:48,764
when Don Juan saw the stone colossus,
shining white in the moonlight...

654
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:52,972
he was seized by
an uncontrollable cheerfulness.

655
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:56,980
He invited him for supper
that same evening.

656
00:44:58,988 --> 00:45:02,277
To Don Juan's surprise,
the statue nodded his head

657
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:06,239
as if accepting the invitation.

658
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:10,448
That evening, Don Juan was dining alone.

659
00:45:11,334 --> 00:45:13,371
Pablo served as usual.

660
00:45:16,464 --> 00:45:18,672
<i>Suddenly,
there was a pounding on the door.</i>

661
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:21,545
<i>It echoed throughout the house.</i>

662
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:24,920
<i>He ordered his servant to open.</i>

663
00:46:20,361 --> 00:46:23,320
<i>He thought the statue spoke to him.</i>

664
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:26,155
<i>"Do you regret your life?"</i>

665
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:30,285
<i>He hurled his "No" towards
the stone statue like a weapon.</i>

666
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:34,657
<i>From the horrifying hand,
that would not release its grip,</i>

667
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,457
<i>flowed ice and fire.</i>

668
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:41,121
<i>And Don Juan felt his flesh melt away.</i>

669
00:46:41,966 --> 00:46:47,303
<i>He raised his arms and clung
to the merciless foot against his chest</i>

670
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:53,801
<i>as he was pressed through the floor
down to the bottom of hell.</i>

671
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:07,356
How very, very interesting.

672
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:09,237
Why did you tell that story?

673
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:12,361
You asked me this morning about experience

674
00:47:12,455 --> 00:47:14,572
and I told you about Don Juan's
only experience.

675
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:18,541
Experience? What's that?

676
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:20,459
I don't know anyway.

677
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:23,209
Well, for me, every day
is overflowing with experiences.

678
00:47:23,299 --> 00:47:27,293
Big and small, important and trivial.
All in one big bundle.

679
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:30,970
I can't get a break
from all the things I experience.

680
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:34,387
Renata dear, don't be sad.

681
00:47:34,477 --> 00:47:35,934
Leave me be.

682
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:37,477
Renata, calm down.

683
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:42,058
You don't understand.
God, how silly. It's laughable.

684
00:47:42,151 --> 00:47:44,143
- Can't I help you?
- Mother, dear...

685
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:47,149
No, nobody can help me.

686
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:50,403
It's just a stupid farce anyway.

687
00:47:52,495 --> 00:47:55,784
Renata, dear. Natan, dear.

688
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,252
Dear Lord, thank you for this day. Amen.

689
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:55,805
One more thing, by the way.

690
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:58,634
Help me figure out my wife.

691
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:02,437
It's difficult to see her suffer
and not know how to help.

692
00:49:05,568 --> 00:49:07,935
One more thing, by the way.

693
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:12,235
Dear Lord, give me the vision.

694
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:15,317
Teach me to understand
the dark hearts of men

695
00:49:15,411 --> 00:49:17,698
and their hidden sufferings

696
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:22,749
Take away my childish simplicity

697
00:49:22,835 --> 00:49:25,168
and give me a new perspective

698
00:49:25,254 --> 00:49:29,419
that is crisp and clear, and yet loving.

699
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:31,374
Thank you and amen.

700
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:55,402
Renata.

701
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:00,283
I'm sorry if I frightened you.
Were you sleeping?

702
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:02,455
No, I don't think so.

703
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:08,041
- Are you ill?
- No, I'm not ill.

704
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:10,880
What is it?

705
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:12,923
I don't know.

706
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:15,423
- I just came in...
- For what?

707
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:18,755
Nothing.

708
00:50:20,643 --> 00:50:22,805
To look at you.

709
00:50:22,895 --> 00:50:25,387
Come sit down.

710
00:50:38,202 --> 00:50:40,740
- Thank you.
- Well?

711
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:42,946
Would you be sad if I died?

712
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,908
Dear, Natan. Why do you say that?

713
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:47,242
Answer my question.

714
00:50:47,336 --> 00:50:50,249
I would become stricken in mourning.
Don't you under...

715
00:50:50,339 --> 00:50:52,626
Why?

716
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:56,335
That's a strange question.
Because I love you, of course.

717
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:59,925
But I'm a nuisance to you and Britt-Marie.

718
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:02,428
- How can you love me?
- That's not true, Renata.

719
00:51:02,518 --> 00:51:06,011
There are difficulties in all of us.
In ourselves as well as others.

720
00:51:07,106 --> 00:51:11,350
No, you don't understand what I mean.

721
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:13,105
I don't?

722
00:51:13,946 --> 00:51:16,029
No.

723
00:51:16,115 --> 00:51:17,822
I really want to, Renata.

724
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:21,026
I so fervently want to understand you.

725
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:24,029
It's like the theater.

726
00:51:24,123 --> 00:51:26,456
You see me in one role and think that's me

727
00:51:26,542 --> 00:51:29,034
and others see me in other roles
and think that's me.

728
00:51:30,421 --> 00:51:32,504
Nobody sees me.

729
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:34,923
You have to be honest, Renata.

730
00:51:36,969 --> 00:51:39,302
That's right, Vicar.

731
00:51:39,388 --> 00:51:41,721
Honesty is the best policy.

732
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:43,890
- Did I say something wrong?
- No.

733
00:51:43,976 --> 00:51:46,059
You're absolutely right.

734
00:51:47,271 --> 00:51:49,308
Good night, dear.

735
00:51:49,398 --> 00:51:55,065
Sleep well on that big ear of yours,
and awake tomorrow to your beautiful world

736
00:51:55,154 --> 00:51:58,022
and all the nice people
and all your experiences.

737
00:51:59,742 --> 00:52:01,574
Good night then.

738
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:09,290
What would you do if I cheated on you?

739
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:10,376
What?

740
00:52:11,295 --> 00:52:12,331
Cheated.

741
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:14,839
What?

742
00:52:16,342 --> 00:52:18,675
Went to bed with another man.

743
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:21,844
You sure have some ideas.

744
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:24,384
What would you do?

745
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:27,342
What would I do?

746
00:52:27,436 --> 00:52:29,348
What would I do?

747
00:52:29,438 --> 00:52:30,849
I would...

748
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:32,771
I don't know.

749
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:35,524
Would you throw me out?

750
00:52:35,611 --> 00:52:39,730
What terrible questions, Renata.
I don't understand.

751
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:42,031
Would you still love me?

752
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:45,406
I have to love you no matter what happens.

753
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:50,115
Love doesn't cease. It remains steadfast
no matter how life plays out.

754
00:52:50,209 --> 00:52:51,950
At least that's how it is for me.

755
00:52:53,462 --> 00:52:55,954
Do you know I feel like screaming?

756
00:52:56,048 --> 00:52:58,290
No, I don't.

757
00:53:04,223 --> 00:53:06,636
Good night, my husband.

758
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:09,388
I apologize for frightening you.

759
00:53:09,478 --> 00:53:11,936
I won't do it again.

760
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:15,307
Renata?

761
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:17,941
Yes?

762
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:23,194
I wish something would touch your heart
so you could feel compassion.

763
00:53:25,494 --> 00:53:27,326
You think that would be good?

764
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:29,370
I don't know.

765
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:34,993
I'll think about it. Good night.

766
00:53:35,087 --> 00:53:37,170
Good night, Renata.

767
00:53:37,256 --> 00:53:38,497
And God bless you.

768
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,822
How did you get in?

769
00:54:13,876 --> 00:54:17,210
Through the door, before you locked it.

770
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:20,122
Then I hid here.

771
00:54:20,215 --> 00:54:22,252
Now I've popped up.

772
00:54:23,469 --> 00:54:24,585
Here I am.

773
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:27,796
- Go away.
- Not at all.

774
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:30,883
Our moment is here.
We've waited long enough.

775
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:33,184
You sure can talk,
but when it comes to love,

776
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:36,058
you're probably as much a fraud
as any other man.

777
00:54:36,148 --> 00:54:39,357
I'm a man of passion, Renata.

778
00:54:42,905 --> 00:54:45,989
I beg you, be quiet. Shut up. Go away.

779
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:50,318
I'm volatile, infantile, foolish,
dishonest and ridiculous... An old bat.

780
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:52,028
But don't wake me.

781
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:54,159
Stop tormenting me
with your stupid little tricks.

782
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:58,994
Let me be. Let me sleep.
Go away, I beg you. I'm tired.

783
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:00,749
Go away.

784
00:55:04,468 --> 00:55:07,006
So you don't want to go to bed with me?

785
00:55:07,846 --> 00:55:09,712
No, I don't.

786
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:15,560
For 300 years, I've sat in hell,
longing for women.

787
00:55:16,605 --> 00:55:20,019
For 300 years,
I have, with all senses intact,

788
00:55:20,108 --> 00:55:23,567
had to endure the damnation of abstinence.

789
00:55:24,822 --> 00:55:28,532
It's because I died in the arms
of my servant girl.

790
00:55:28,617 --> 00:55:33,203
For 300 years, I've been storing up.

791
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:36,577
It's not every day
you meet a man that loaded.

792
00:55:37,793 --> 00:55:41,286
Even if he is a bit
tarnished on the exterior.

793
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:43,793
So you're from hell?

794
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:45,874
And you want me to believe that?

795
00:55:45,968 --> 00:55:47,800
Believe it or not.

796
00:55:48,637 --> 00:55:51,471
Heaven, hell. It's all lies.

797
00:55:51,557 --> 00:55:53,389
It doesn't matter.

798
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:55,637
You're not risking anything.

799
00:55:56,478 --> 00:55:58,140
But it just might happen

800
00:55:58,230 --> 00:56:01,394
that you'll experience something
you'll never forget.

801
00:56:01,483 --> 00:56:03,224
Experience?

802
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:06,561
A dream, Renata. It'll be like a dream.

803
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:08,772
Yes, it's a dream.

804
00:56:09,867 --> 00:56:13,406
The only problem is
you can't convince me it's mine.

805
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:17,079
- Pretend, Renata.
- No, I'm too old.

806
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:21,409
- Can't you fake it?
- No, I've done that all along.

807
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:49,153
Can you see me in hell, Renata?

808
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:55,076
Thin, cranky, naked and gray,
breathing dust all day.

809
00:56:55,704 --> 00:57:00,950
Day after day,
I sadly trudge through my chores.

810
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:03,372
Can you see me?

811
00:57:03,462 --> 00:57:07,126
I'm no great villain.
Not one of hell's favorites.

812
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:11,129
I'm just a poor condemned man
without hope or pleasure.

813
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:15,805
When I get to heaven it'll be the same.
Nobody cares about Pablo.

814
00:57:16,934 --> 00:57:21,895
But then I was granted earthly life
for just one day and one night.

815
00:57:22,731 --> 00:57:25,314
And I meet you, Renata.

816
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:30,987
And you're the greatest,
loveliest, most wonderful, finest,

817
00:57:31,073 --> 00:57:35,158
sweetest, nicest, fantastic masterpiece

818
00:57:35,243 --> 00:57:38,031
that Pablo has ever experienced.

819
00:57:40,749 --> 00:57:43,207
I know I'm boring you.

820
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:48,375
No, go on.

821
00:57:49,257 --> 00:57:51,544
You're fairly amusing.

822
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:55,632
No, I have nothing more to say.

823
00:57:57,432 --> 00:58:01,016
I'll return to the underworld
and my tiresome life.

824
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:08,561
Think of Pablo sometime.

825
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:13,859
Even I, in my vileness,
am the child of a woman.

826
00:58:13,949 --> 00:58:17,989
And my mother cried every day for my sins.

827
00:58:18,954 --> 00:58:20,786
And Mother...

828
00:58:20,872 --> 00:58:24,036
She showed me true tenderness.

829
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:28,126
Come here.

830
00:58:35,303 --> 00:58:38,091
You're not ashamed
to appeal to my maternal side?

831
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:40,047
No, I'm not ashamed.

832
00:58:40,726 --> 00:58:43,560
You've managed to do something rare.

833
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:45,557
You've touched my heart.

834
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:48,059
That's a kind thing to say.

835
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:49,982
You've given me an experience.

836
00:58:51,069 --> 00:58:52,150
Thank you.

837
00:58:53,155 --> 00:58:55,898
You've earned a reward.

838
00:58:55,991 --> 00:58:57,653
Thank you.

839
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:02,369
You may kiss me.

840
00:59:05,584 --> 00:59:07,576
- Remember your orders?
- I've forgotten.

841
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:10,127
- You refuse to obey.
- Can't you tell?

842
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:13,251
It'll be bad for you,
and bad for her as well.

843
00:59:39,284 --> 00:59:42,277
- Who are you?
- I'm a demon.

844
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:46,114
A little devil from hell,
if that's easier to comprehend.

845
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:48,291
How very interesting.

846
00:59:49,294 --> 00:59:51,331
I'm dreaming, of course.

847
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:53,708
No, I'm wide awake.

848
00:59:53,799 --> 00:59:54,960
What do you want?

849
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:58,964
Only trouble, Vicar. Only trouble.

850
00:59:59,054 --> 01:00:01,967
I'm not one of those happy devils
who buys souls

851
01:00:02,057 --> 01:00:04,549
and doles out happiness and gold.

852
01:00:04,643 --> 01:00:07,306
I'm a "trouble" devil.

853
01:00:07,395 --> 01:00:09,682
Nonetheless, I'm honored by the visit.

854
01:00:09,773 --> 01:00:13,062
To think this could happen to me.
Praise the Lord.

855
01:00:13,151 --> 01:00:15,313
Stop that!

856
01:00:15,403 --> 01:00:19,317
Aren't consideration and manners in order,
even though I am from hell?

857
01:00:19,407 --> 01:00:22,821
I apologize, my dear man.
It was thoughtless of me.

858
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:25,198
Well, well, let's have a heart-to-heart.

859
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:27,905
I don't have a heart.

860
01:00:28,792 --> 01:00:32,832
But if you want to know,
your wife's about to go to bed

861
01:00:32,921 --> 01:00:35,334
with one of your splendid guests.

862
01:00:35,423 --> 01:00:37,039
What are you saying?

863
01:00:37,134 --> 01:00:39,751
Are you hard of hearing?

864
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:45,427
Your wife Renata is lying with a man.

865
01:00:45,517 --> 01:00:46,553
Understand now?

866
01:00:48,103 --> 01:00:49,435
No.

867
01:00:52,941 --> 01:00:55,354
You mean Renata is about to...

868
01:00:55,443 --> 01:00:58,402
No, dear devil.

869
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:01,606
Come up with something more probable,
if you want to upset me.

870
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:04,408
I'm not asking you to believe me.

871
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:10,035
I'm just asking you to get out of bed,
go to her door.

872
01:01:10,125 --> 01:01:14,916
You'll find it locked,
and open it with this key.

873
01:01:16,798 --> 01:01:18,414
Well?

874
01:01:23,471 --> 01:01:26,384
- And if I don't go?
- Oh, you'll go.

875
01:01:26,474 --> 01:01:31,060
Nothing has greater attraction
than a potentially evil moment.

876
01:01:31,146 --> 01:01:33,138
You're a real devil, you.

877
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:35,097
I take that as a compliment.

878
01:01:48,872 --> 01:01:50,329
Well?

879
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:52,953
Aren't you going to unlock it?

880
01:01:53,585 --> 01:01:55,952
You'll finally become aware,

881
01:01:56,046 --> 01:01:59,790
see clearly, comprehend and understand.

882
01:02:00,592 --> 01:02:04,882
You'll see loathsomeness
and animalistic desire.

883
01:02:05,847 --> 01:02:11,844
Something will finally pierce
your soul and make you a man.

884
01:02:11,937 --> 01:02:15,305
You who have playfully
strolled through life.

885
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:18,812
You close your eyes
and think the best of everyone.

886
01:02:20,028 --> 01:02:21,690
Well?

887
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:23,772
Open the door

888
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:28,656
and behold deceit in full bloom.

889
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:31,237
You and your experiences.

890
01:02:32,123 --> 01:02:36,333
Here's an experience
that'll lodge itself in your throat

891
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:38,957
and leave you gasping for air.

892
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:43,882
I think we need to have ourselves
a drink first.

893
01:02:43,969 --> 01:02:45,676
- A drink?
- Yes.

894
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:47,799
Now, that's an idea.

895
01:02:47,889 --> 01:02:51,007
Come, Vicar. We'll strengthen our hatred.

896
01:02:51,101 --> 01:02:52,387
Yes.

897
01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:04,904
Dear brother,
I'm so excited I can't find it.

898
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:07,653
You're smaller. Can you help me?

899
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:10,075
It's in there.

900
01:03:10,161 --> 01:03:13,325
- No, I don't see it.
- Yes, it's there on the left.

901
01:03:13,415 --> 01:03:15,748
Farther in. Even farther.

902
01:03:15,834 --> 01:03:18,201
Here, use the stool.

903
01:03:19,087 --> 01:03:21,329
There we go. I'm sure you see it now.

904
01:03:21,423 --> 01:03:23,540
Here it is. I've got it.

905
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:26,000
There it is and you've got it.

906
01:03:27,971 --> 01:03:30,179
Please, go ahead and keep it,
little brother.

907
01:03:30,265 --> 01:03:33,349
You could use something to brace you up.

908
01:03:33,435 --> 01:03:36,348
It'll be a while before you return home.

909
01:03:37,188 --> 01:03:39,225
I've got a devil in my cupboard.

910
01:03:39,316 --> 01:03:41,308
I've got a devil in my cupboard.

911
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:50,282
Hey, how are you in there?

912
01:03:50,368 --> 01:03:53,532
All right. Your gin isn't bad.

913
01:03:53,621 --> 01:03:55,704
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

914
01:03:56,791 --> 01:03:59,283
Are you going to check on the wife now?

915
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:03,629
No, old man. I'm not so inclined.

916
01:04:03,715 --> 01:04:06,207
You're a damn wimp.

917
01:04:06,301 --> 01:04:08,213
Tell me more, little brother.

918
01:04:08,303 --> 01:04:11,887
I'll listen to everything you tell me.

919
01:04:11,973 --> 01:04:14,886
I'll take advantage of your knowledge.

920
01:04:14,976 --> 01:04:17,093
But not for evil, for good.

921
01:04:17,187 --> 01:04:18,723
You devil.

922
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:23,148
Don't argue. Don't be sad. Don't fuss.

923
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:29,898
Hey, if you're good, I'll pray for you
and maybe you'll go to heaven one day.

924
01:04:29,991 --> 01:04:33,484
How could you be so wicked?

925
01:04:33,578 --> 01:04:35,820
You're a vicar.

926
01:04:35,914 --> 01:04:38,497
You flatter me, my boy.

927
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:41,291
But rest now,
and we'll speak in the morning.

928
01:04:41,378 --> 01:04:43,085
Good night.

929
01:05:11,199 --> 01:05:16,945
"Journal of the devil in my cupboard."

930
01:05:17,872 --> 01:05:22,116
So ends the second act,
followed shortly by the third.

931
01:05:22,210 --> 01:05:25,499
My ladies and gentlemen,
a moment of your patience.

932
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:29,047
The author has included
a description of nature...

933
01:05:29,134 --> 01:05:33,219
a sort of artistic weather report...

934
01:05:33,304 --> 01:05:36,342
that he wants me to pass on.

935
01:05:36,433 --> 01:05:38,641
Black night.

936
01:05:38,726 --> 01:05:40,467
The night is thus black.

937
01:05:40,562 --> 01:05:43,054
Full moon. Complete silence.

938
01:05:43,148 --> 01:05:45,481
Fragrances. Various kinds.

939
01:05:45,567 --> 01:05:47,809
Here's something about dew.

940
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:50,485
Full moon again, etc.

941
01:05:50,572 --> 01:05:53,690
No, let's skip all this
and get straight to the point.

942
01:07:37,554 --> 01:07:39,841
Do with me as you please.

943
01:07:41,224 --> 01:07:44,592
I can't bear your suffering,
which I do not understand.

944
01:07:45,853 --> 01:07:49,642
But it burns and torments me more
than anything I've ever experienced.

945
01:07:50,358 --> 01:07:53,476
I beg you to free me from your suffering.

946
01:07:54,529 --> 01:07:56,566
My suffering.

947
01:08:00,868 --> 01:08:03,155
I don't love you.

948
01:08:03,246 --> 01:08:05,579
I don't desire your body.

949
01:08:06,541 --> 01:08:09,659
You're frightening and incomprehensible.

950
01:08:11,212 --> 01:08:13,295
But I'm no longer scared of you.

951
01:08:14,215 --> 01:08:17,083
You can't touch my love for Jonas.

952
01:08:18,636 --> 01:08:24,098
The wound you give me,
will only hurt me and you.

953
01:09:17,195 --> 01:09:21,565
- Did you sleep?
- Oh, yes. I slept and dreamt.

954
01:09:22,450 --> 01:09:24,908
So devils have dreams?

955
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:27,862
Only nightmares, Vicar.

956
01:09:27,955 --> 01:09:29,947
For others, that is.

957
01:09:30,625 --> 01:09:32,537
Do you want to hear my dream?

958
01:09:32,627 --> 01:09:34,789
It would be very interesting.

959
01:09:34,879 --> 01:09:36,916
You have a daughter, don't you?

960
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:39,794
A rose of Sharon, the apple of your eye.

961
01:09:39,884 --> 01:09:42,547
A little virgin in the earthly meat stew.

962
01:09:42,637 --> 01:09:44,253
Hey, quiet.

963
01:09:44,347 --> 01:09:48,011
Of course, as the vicar commands.

964
01:09:50,978 --> 01:09:54,062
No, tell me. Tell me your dream.

965
01:09:54,148 --> 01:09:58,142
While one of your guests
lay with your wife,

966
01:09:58,236 --> 01:10:01,900
the other guest
seduced your fair daughter.

967
01:10:01,989 --> 01:10:04,106
And you're actually to blame for it all,

968
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:08,444
because you're the one
who invited them to stay the night.

969
01:10:08,538 --> 01:10:11,076
Well, what do you say to that?

970
01:10:12,834 --> 01:10:14,416
It can't be.

971
01:10:14,502 --> 01:10:16,994
Feel free to keep your "little brother."

972
01:10:18,005 --> 01:10:21,840
Now you see what it's like
to have a devil in your cupboard.

973
01:10:27,473 --> 01:10:29,510
You're too late.

974
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:32,092
You're always too late.

975
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:45,773
- Forgive me, Britt-Marie.
- What's wrong?

976
01:10:45,867 --> 01:10:49,031
I don't know. I've probably gone mad.

977
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:53,239
I have a devil in the cupboard
and he dreamt that you...

978
01:10:53,958 --> 01:10:55,119
That you...

979
01:10:55,209 --> 01:10:59,123
- Are you sleepwalking, Daddy?
- No, not anymore.

980
01:10:59,213 --> 01:11:02,297
I've been sleepwalking all along,
but not anymore.

981
01:11:02,383 --> 01:11:04,545
That's what's so confusing.

982
01:11:05,303 --> 01:11:10,014
You see things in another light, and you...

983
01:11:10,975 --> 01:11:12,637
And you...

984
01:11:13,394 --> 01:11:15,852
Dear child, is everything all right?

985
01:11:17,398 --> 01:11:18,639
Of course.

986
01:11:19,734 --> 01:11:20,850
Were you crying?

987
01:11:27,825 --> 01:11:29,487
Good night, Daddy.

988
01:11:30,912 --> 01:11:33,074
Good night, my little girl.

989
01:12:10,785 --> 01:12:14,495
I'll go out and dig up
the half-finished garden,

990
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:17,197
and then sit down in the grass,

991
01:12:18,042 --> 01:12:20,034
and let it rain on me.

992
01:12:26,133 --> 01:12:28,750
It'll be wonderful to freeze.

993
01:12:29,387 --> 01:12:30,878
And then for breakfast,

994
01:12:30,972 --> 01:12:35,842
I'll have some of those large,
tart apples down by the gate.

995
01:12:36,978 --> 01:12:40,722
After that, I'll return to hell, Renata.

996
01:12:41,566 --> 01:12:45,981
But grateful. Do you understand?

997
01:13:09,176 --> 01:13:10,667
Renata.

998
01:13:13,723 --> 01:13:15,430
What happens now, Renata?

999
01:13:17,184 --> 01:13:18,846
He touched my heart.

1000
01:13:21,606 --> 01:13:23,472
But that wasn't the most difficult.

1001
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:25,440
Then what was?

1002
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:29,812
That I thought of you the whole time.

1003
01:13:31,532 --> 01:13:32,568
Of me?

1004
01:13:33,075 --> 01:13:35,192
And I felt sympathy for you.

1005
01:13:37,121 --> 01:13:38,828
What happens now?

1006
01:13:39,957 --> 01:13:42,165
I don't know.

1007
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:43,287
Nothing.

1008
01:13:44,795 --> 01:13:47,128
So you'll stay with me.

1009
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:50,290
Where would I go?

1010
01:13:52,386 --> 01:13:54,548
Do you think we can make a fresh start?

1011
01:13:55,097 --> 01:13:58,386
No, I don't think so.

1012
01:13:59,894 --> 01:14:01,726
Do you think we can change?

1013
01:14:03,898 --> 01:14:05,730
We can try.

1014
01:14:08,235 --> 01:14:12,275
Go lie down, Renata. You'll catch cold.

1015
01:15:01,539 --> 01:15:05,374
I've been looking for you all morning.
Why are you hiding?

1016
01:15:05,459 --> 01:15:07,371
Jonas will be here shortly.

1017
01:15:07,461 --> 01:15:13,128
I need time alone to gather my thoughts,
so that I can meet him properly.

1018
01:15:13,217 --> 01:15:16,176
There's something I have to say first.

1019
01:15:18,139 --> 01:15:20,222
I love you.

1020
01:15:23,477 --> 01:15:25,389
Yes, I'll leave.

1021
01:15:32,319 --> 01:15:34,561
Have mercy on me.

1022
01:15:35,865 --> 01:15:37,527
I beg you.

1023
01:15:38,242 --> 01:15:41,076
Allow me for one moment to believe

1024
01:15:41,162 --> 01:15:44,576
that you have some feeling for me.

1025
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:48,116
Lie to me.

1026
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:50,661
I'll believe you.

1027
01:15:52,423 --> 01:15:54,506
I'll ardently believe you.

1028
01:15:58,512 --> 01:16:00,174
I beg you.

1029
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:06,097
Can't you see I'm humiliating myself?

1030
01:16:06,687 --> 01:16:08,599
You say that you love me,

1031
01:16:08,689 --> 01:16:12,057
and I believe it to be true,
but it doesn't matter.

1032
01:16:16,030 --> 01:16:17,896
I don't understand.

1033
01:16:22,912 --> 01:16:26,952
Yesterday,
I was a young girl who liked to play.

1034
01:16:27,041 --> 01:16:30,955
I thought your fierceness
and cool demeanor was exciting.

1035
01:16:31,879 --> 01:16:34,587
I wanted you to hurt me.

1036
01:16:35,424 --> 01:16:38,633
I might have been scared, but not much.

1037
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:43,339
I thought my love for Jonas
protected me from all danger.

1038
01:16:44,934 --> 01:16:47,347
Last night I realized I was wrong.

1039
01:16:48,395 --> 01:16:51,604
My love doesn't protect me from anything.

1040
01:16:53,234 --> 01:16:55,692
Your suffering burned me.

1041
01:16:56,946 --> 01:17:01,907
Suddenly, I wanted to hold you close
and give you everything I could.

1042
01:17:03,744 --> 01:17:05,986
But that was also a lie.

1043
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:08,618
I know that. I'm certain of it now.

1044
01:17:09,917 --> 01:17:14,378
What I felt were just dangerous dreams
surrounding my own desire.

1045
01:17:16,090 --> 01:17:18,673
A desire I've never experienced before.

1046
01:17:22,429 --> 01:17:24,512
Last night made me an adult.

1047
01:17:34,608 --> 01:17:37,351
The show is over, Don Juan.

1048
01:17:39,864 --> 01:17:42,607
The higher powers have tricked us.

1049
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:48,196
Our evil has fallen flat against the cold,
calculating goodness of heaven.

1050
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:52,870
I'm tired and bored.

1051
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:55,452
I intend to retire

1052
01:17:55,546 --> 01:17:59,381
and then heaven
will have to manage without hell.

1053
01:17:59,466 --> 01:18:02,675
Then He, up there,
will see how easy it gets.

1054
01:18:03,971 --> 01:18:08,090
A young woman's virginity
convinces us to send our best weapon,

1055
01:18:08,184 --> 01:18:10,050
and what happens?

1056
01:18:10,144 --> 01:18:14,935
The unemotional one returns
madly smitten with love.

1057
01:18:15,524 --> 01:18:18,437
Curtains, gentlemen. Curtains.

1058
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:20,314
But that's not enough.

1059
01:18:20,404 --> 01:18:24,739
A vicar of priceless stupidity,
from hell's point-of-view,

1060
01:18:24,825 --> 01:18:29,286
is suddenly transformed and captures
my most powerful demon in his cupboard.

1061
01:18:29,371 --> 01:18:31,909
He's become aware.

1062
01:18:31,999 --> 01:18:35,458
In short, a power to be reckoned with.

1063
01:18:35,544 --> 01:18:38,833
But not only that,
an unusually competent woman,

1064
01:18:38,923 --> 01:18:43,668
well-qualified for hell,
comes to a self-realization

1065
01:18:43,761 --> 01:18:46,094
and is stricken with compassion
for her husband.

1066
01:18:46,180 --> 01:18:48,888
Now she might become a good wife.

1067
01:18:50,267 --> 01:18:52,509
But that's not enough.

1068
01:18:52,603 --> 01:18:54,720
A little blackguard named Pablo

1069
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:59,524
dared to defy my will and his
already imposed punishments.

1070
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:05,940
Who came up with
this unusually stupid idea

1071
01:19:06,033 --> 01:19:08,696
of sending Don Juan to earth?

1072
01:19:18,545 --> 01:19:20,502
It's true.

1073
01:19:21,298 --> 01:19:22,960
It's true.

1074
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:24,916
It was my idea.

1075
01:19:28,305 --> 01:19:31,514
I'm sickened
by my handling of this matter.

1076
01:19:32,559 --> 01:19:38,726
It's sad, not to mention unartistic,
to have to admit love's victory

1077
01:19:38,816 --> 01:19:41,775
and evil's utter defeat.

1078
01:19:45,072 --> 01:19:47,735
I'm getting old.

1079
01:19:49,076 --> 01:19:50,317
Leave me.

1080
01:19:58,085 --> 01:20:03,626
Don Juan might grace me
with his company for a short while.

1081
01:20:07,594 --> 01:20:10,837
I can't say that I love you, Master.

1082
01:20:10,931 --> 01:20:14,345
And you've had enough of love.

1083
01:20:14,435 --> 01:20:18,179
But life would have been meaningless
without you.

1084
01:20:18,272 --> 01:20:20,855
And you should know
that I'll be faithful to you

1085
01:20:20,941 --> 01:20:24,400
until the very end of damnation.

1086
01:20:27,614 --> 01:20:29,446
That's all.

1087
01:20:37,207 --> 01:20:39,915
- Don Juan.
- Yes, Master.

1088
01:20:40,794 --> 01:20:44,708
One of the worst torments
was your jealousy.

1089
01:20:44,798 --> 01:20:46,630
Yes, Master.

1090
01:20:46,717 --> 01:20:50,301
At least I can give you
a little punishment.

1091
01:20:57,061 --> 01:20:59,974
What's your name again?

1092
01:21:00,481 --> 01:21:02,768
I've forgotten, your grace.

1093
01:21:02,858 --> 01:21:05,396
You're famous for your hearing.

1094
01:21:05,486 --> 01:21:07,443
That's correct.

1095
01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:12,274
Will you see what's currently happening
with the young, innocent woman?

1096
01:21:13,202 --> 01:21:16,786
It might interest our emotional friend.

1097
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:21,663
Wait! I hear something
dreadfully uncomfortable, it's...

1098
01:21:21,752 --> 01:21:23,459
What's it called...

1099
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:26,413
Church bells. Horrible sounding.

1100
01:21:27,049 --> 01:21:30,759
A voice is speaking,
it sounds like an actor.

1101
01:21:30,844 --> 01:21:35,430
"Do you take Britt-Marie
as your beloved..."

1102
01:21:35,516 --> 01:21:38,384
"Do you take Jonas as your..."

1103
01:21:40,187 --> 01:21:42,429
- The young woman said "Yes."
- Continue.

1104
01:21:42,523 --> 01:21:46,392
She said it so loudly, your grace.
Sudden sounds are painful.

1105
01:21:47,236 --> 01:21:50,445
- What else do you hear?
- A big party.

1106
01:21:50,531 --> 01:21:53,444
No, the young woman isn't there.

1107
01:21:53,534 --> 01:21:55,696
Where could she be?

1108
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:00,868
No, she's not there. Now I hear her.

1109
01:22:00,958 --> 01:22:02,790
She's laughing.

1110
01:22:02,876 --> 01:22:05,789
A young man is breathing heavily on her.
Like this:

1111
01:22:10,384 --> 01:22:14,424
She's trying to say something,
but he smothers her words with kisses.

1112
01:22:16,473 --> 01:22:18,886
Well, what do you hear now?

1113
01:22:19,726 --> 01:22:21,638
Now it's quiet, your grace.

1114
01:22:22,479 --> 01:22:25,813
Now I hear a bed that's...

1115
01:22:25,899 --> 01:22:28,141
The rustle of clothing that...

1116
01:22:28,235 --> 01:22:31,319
It could be an auditory illusion,
your grace.

1117
01:22:31,405 --> 01:22:35,820
Now I hear her breathing heavily.
Sort of like this...

1118
01:22:35,909 --> 01:22:37,992
What do you hear?

1119
01:22:38,078 --> 01:22:39,865
She's gasping.

1120
01:22:42,082 --> 01:22:43,914
Now it's quiet.

1121
01:22:50,090 --> 01:22:51,877
Now it's quiet.

1122
01:22:52,759 --> 01:22:56,048
She just screamed,
but not as if from pain exactly.

1123
01:22:56,138 --> 01:22:58,755
I don't know how to describe this scream.

1124
01:22:58,849 --> 01:23:01,387
The gentleman might understand anyway.

1125
01:23:02,519 --> 01:23:05,262
Now she's crying.

1126
01:23:05,355 --> 01:23:08,689
But not from sorrow.
No, I'm convinced it's not.

1127
01:23:08,775 --> 01:23:12,109
- Maybe from happiness?
- What do I know, your grace?

1128
01:23:13,447 --> 01:23:18,283
My eye should be healthy,
but the sty still remains.

1129
01:23:18,368 --> 01:23:20,951
Very strange.

1130
01:23:21,038 --> 01:23:23,530
The young ones are talking to each other.

1131
01:23:23,624 --> 01:23:25,536
I can hear what they're saying.

1132
01:23:25,626 --> 01:23:29,290
She's saying,
"Don't kiss me so forcefully."

1133
01:23:29,379 --> 01:23:32,747
He responds, "Why not?"

1134
01:23:32,841 --> 01:23:37,632
"Well," she says,
"I have a small cut on my lip."

1135
01:23:37,721 --> 01:23:40,464
Then he says, "How did you get that?"

1136
01:23:40,557 --> 01:23:46,394
And then he laughs and says,
"Maybe somebody else kissed you?"

1137
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:50,394
She responds, "What a stupid joke.

1138
01:23:50,484 --> 01:23:54,524
You know I've never kissed another man."

1139
01:23:55,405 --> 01:23:58,022
I can hear that she's lying.

1140
01:24:04,373 --> 01:24:09,334
By all devils,
and my grandmother's toxic tooth,

1141
01:24:09,419 --> 01:24:11,206
the sty is gone.

1142
01:24:13,590 --> 01:24:17,209
So hell still won a victory in the end.

1143
01:24:19,846 --> 01:24:21,553
May I go?

1144
01:24:22,099 --> 01:24:25,183
Of course you may, Don Juan.
Good evening, gentlemen.

1145
01:24:35,362 --> 01:24:36,773
Is it very painful?

1146
01:24:43,453 --> 01:24:45,615
If it gives you pleasure, I'm suffering.

1147
01:24:46,540 --> 01:24:49,954
But I won't fall down
and I have no regrets.

1148
01:24:50,043 --> 01:24:52,456
I find you and your punishments silly.

1149
01:24:53,297 --> 01:24:56,381
You, Mr. Satan, and Him up there.

1150
01:24:56,466 --> 01:24:58,674
I despise you both.

1151
01:25:00,053 --> 01:25:04,172
Never in eternity shall Don Juan bow down.

1152
01:25:05,058 --> 01:25:07,141
You'll have to punish him
with worse horrors

1153
01:25:07,227 --> 01:25:09,310
than those currently
tearing his insides apart.

1154
01:25:10,606 --> 01:25:12,563
I remain Don Juan...

1155
01:25:13,567 --> 01:25:15,934
he who despises both God and Satan.

1156
01:25:17,487 --> 01:25:19,820
I allow myself to spit at your feet.

1157
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:26,737
Good evening, Master.

1158
01:25:26,830 --> 01:25:32,701
I wish you, and Him above,
all success in your paltry business.

1159
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:48,341
Let Don Juan sleep.

1160
01:25:48,435 --> 01:25:51,018
With or without dreams?

1161
01:25:51,104 --> 01:25:53,061
With dreams, of course.

1162
01:25:53,148 --> 01:25:56,141
And what shall we let him dream?

1163
01:25:57,944 --> 01:26:00,106
Of the earthly paradise.

1164
01:26:01,490 --> 01:26:04,324
And above all, of love.

1165
01:26:04,409 --> 01:26:08,278
Isn't that a little too cruel, your grace?

1166
01:26:08,372 --> 01:26:12,992
No punishment is severe enough
for those who love.

1167
01:26:24,054 --> 01:26:28,048
Ladies and gentlemen, so ends our comedy.

1168
01:26:28,141 --> 01:26:30,758
Heaven has won a brilliant victory.

1169
01:26:30,852 --> 01:26:32,593
There's no doubt about it.

1170
01:26:32,688 --> 01:26:35,351
But even hell has scored a victory.

1171
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:40,435
And as the author of our comedy puts it,

1172
01:26:40,529 --> 01:26:43,317
"The smallest victory for hell

1173
01:26:43,407 --> 01:26:48,823
can be considerably more devastating
than a great success for heaven."

1174
01:26:48,912 --> 01:26:52,747
But in order that our esteemed audience
may forget such unpleasant,

1175
01:26:52,833 --> 01:26:54,665
and perhaps doubtful truths,

1176
01:26:54,751 --> 01:26:56,617
we have arranged for a closing scene

1177
01:26:56,712 --> 01:27:00,797
depicting great and true love
in it's purest form.

1178
01:27:01,508 --> 01:27:03,465
You'll now see the young couple

1179
01:27:03,552 --> 01:27:06,716
enveloped by the wedding night's
magical intoxication.

1180
01:27:11,518 --> 01:27:15,558
It's really very interesting,
as the vicar would say.

1181
01:27:21,278 --> 01:27:22,940
I love you.

1182
01:27:23,780 --> 01:27:25,863
I love you.

1183
01:27:27,951 --> 01:27:31,991
I'll love you for all eternity. Amen.

1184
01:27:39,963 --> 01:27:41,829
May I kiss you now?

1185
01:27:41,923 --> 01:27:44,631
Yes, but careful.

1186
01:27:52,726 --> 01:27:54,308
THIS IS THE END
