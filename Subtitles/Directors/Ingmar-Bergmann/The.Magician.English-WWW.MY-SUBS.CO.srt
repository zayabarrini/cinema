1
00:00:48,431 --> 00:00:51,475
THE MAGICIAN

2
00:03:30,093 --> 00:03:33,387
- Well?
- What?

3
00:03:33,555 --> 00:03:37,349
- Find what you were digging for?
- No, not a thing.

4
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,521
You and your mandrake
and your severed fingers...

5
00:03:43,106 --> 00:03:45,274
and other mischief.
- That's right.

6
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,236
Spirits used to howl
so loudly in this forest

7
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:52,781
that no one dared enter
after sundown.

8
00:03:52,907 --> 00:03:54,616
I remember it well.

9
00:03:54,743 --> 00:03:56,785
You and your spirits!

10
00:03:56,911 --> 00:04:00,247
Albert, why do you keep
Tubal on as your assistant?

11
00:04:00,415 --> 00:04:02,499
You should get rid of him.

12
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,793
You hear what
your grandmother's telling you?

13
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:08,213
How would Vogler's
Magnetic Health Theater

14
00:04:08,339 --> 00:04:11,508
manage without Tubal?
I ask you.

15
00:04:11,634 --> 00:04:14,428
Who bailed us out
in Copenhagen at night,

16
00:04:14,596 --> 00:04:16,847
and at risk to his own life,

17
00:04:16,973 --> 00:04:19,892
after our Danish tour
went to hell?

18
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:25,606
I ask,
but no one answers.

19
00:04:25,774 --> 00:04:29,276
And who brews our potions?

20
00:04:29,444 --> 00:04:31,612
You'd have been
strung up long ago

21
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:34,490
if people found out
what you put in them.

22
00:04:34,616 --> 00:04:38,035
"What's good isn't always tasty,"
Mother always said.

23
00:04:38,161 --> 00:04:40,329
In any case,
I take the responsibility.

24
00:04:40,455 --> 00:04:42,372
And the profits.

25
00:04:42,499 --> 00:04:44,374
Careful, Granny.

26
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:47,294
I happen to know something.

27
00:05:10,652 --> 00:05:12,277
You hear that?

28
00:05:12,695 --> 00:05:16,448
It was a scream.
I heard it very clearly.

29
00:05:19,035 --> 00:05:21,078
That's a fox.

30
00:05:21,204 --> 00:05:22,996
A fox?

31
00:05:23,498 --> 00:05:25,791
A fox on two emaciated legs,

32
00:05:25,917 --> 00:05:29,253
covered in blood,
with its head hanging by a few sinews.

33
00:05:29,504 --> 00:05:32,464
A fox with no eyes

34
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:35,509
and a rotten hole for a mouth.

35
00:05:35,677 --> 00:05:38,220
I've seen them,

36
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:41,640
and I know what I know.

37
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:53,402
Damned if I'll sit up there

38
00:05:53,528 --> 00:05:56,989
with ghosts and ghouls
howling around my ears!

39
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:05,914
"Gash in the eye, blood in the mouth,
fingers gone, and broken neck.

40
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,293
He calls you down, he calls you out,
beyond the dead,

41
00:06:09,544 --> 00:06:13,797
beyond the living, the living dead,
with their upraised hands..."

42
00:06:56,257 --> 00:06:58,133
Good day, sir.

43
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:02,012
My name is Johan Spegel.

44
00:07:02,847 --> 00:07:06,808
I am very ill,
as you can see.

45
00:07:08,269 --> 00:07:12,981
Would you alleviate my suffering
with a little brandy?

46
00:07:13,608 --> 00:07:18,278
For brandy is my infirmity
but its remedy too.

47
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:32,793
I am an actor.

48
00:07:33,878 --> 00:07:39,800
In fact, a member
of the famous Stenborg troupe.

49
00:07:41,552 --> 00:07:46,974
But my illness has put
an end to my career.

50
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:56,358
Are you an actor too?

51
00:07:57,527 --> 00:08:00,153
Then why this disguise?

52
00:08:00,655 --> 00:08:05,325
Your beard is fake,
and your eyebrows and hair are dyed.

53
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:11,665
Are you a swindler
who must conceal his true face?

54
00:08:19,549 --> 00:08:21,717
Let us rest a moment...

55
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,177
and breathe.

56
00:08:26,556 --> 00:08:28,557
Twilight is falling...

57
00:08:30,059 --> 00:08:34,313
and this is the last day of life.

58
00:08:38,526 --> 00:08:42,571
I've always longed for a knife...

59
00:08:43,865 --> 00:08:48,493
a blade to lay bare my entrails...

60
00:08:49,537 --> 00:08:52,331
set my brain and heart free...

61
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:56,460
free me from my substance...

62
00:08:57,879 --> 00:09:02,007
and cut away my tongue
and my manhood.

63
00:09:05,303 --> 00:09:07,888
A sharp blade...

64
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:11,892
that would scrape out
all uncleanliness.

65
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:16,897
Then the so-called spirit...

66
00:09:17,982 --> 00:09:22,611
would rise up
from this meaningless carcass.

67
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,337
What are you reading, sir?

68
00:09:40,463 --> 00:09:42,839
A novel about swindlers.

69
00:09:42,965 --> 00:09:46,134
- Colleagues of yours?
- There are no swindlers here.

70
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:47,761
No?

71
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:50,097
An interesting book,
in any case.

72
00:09:50,431 --> 00:09:54,267
"Deception is so prevalent
that those who speak the truth

73
00:09:54,435 --> 00:09:57,437
are usually branded
as the greatest liars."

74
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:02,692
The author presumes there's
a great general thing called truth

75
00:10:02,819 --> 00:10:04,820
somewhere out there.

76
00:10:04,946 --> 00:10:07,114
That theory is pure illusion.

77
00:10:07,281 --> 00:10:09,866
So much for your reading,
Mr. Aman.

78
00:10:09,992 --> 00:10:12,119
Mr. Tubal shouldn't speak
with his mouth full.

79
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:15,956
I find this business about truth
devilishly interesting.

80
00:10:16,124 --> 00:10:18,750
Yes, it's a beautiful passion.

81
00:10:18,876 --> 00:10:23,004
lf I say one's rump is behind
and one's head is on one's neck,

82
00:10:23,131 --> 00:10:26,925
that's an absolute truth,
and I like such truths.

83
00:10:27,051 --> 00:10:30,554
One's rump behind
and one's head on one's neck?

84
00:10:30,972 --> 00:10:34,307
A rather dubious truth.
- I don't follow.

85
00:10:34,475 --> 00:10:37,477
It appears to be
just the opposite in your case.

86
00:10:37,645 --> 00:10:41,314
You're very amusing.
Almost a pity you're dying.

87
00:10:41,482 --> 00:10:43,275
You'll die too.
You just don't believe it.

88
00:10:43,401 --> 00:10:45,527
A matter for the future,

89
00:10:45,653 --> 00:10:48,530
and the future interests me
as little as the past.

90
00:10:48,656 --> 00:10:51,867
Can't you see
I'm a lily of the field?

91
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:54,661
He's dying.

92
00:10:59,167 --> 00:11:04,421
You want to record
the precise moment.

93
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:07,841
Observe carefully.

94
00:11:09,051 --> 00:11:11,887
I will keep my face open

95
00:11:12,013 --> 00:11:14,514
to your curiosity.

96
00:11:17,101 --> 00:11:19,019
What am I feeling?

97
00:11:19,854 --> 00:11:21,771
Fear...

98
00:11:21,939 --> 00:11:24,024
and well-being.

99
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:28,737
Now death has reached my hands...

100
00:11:29,614 --> 00:11:31,364
my arms...

101
00:11:32,617 --> 00:11:34,117
my feet...

102
00:11:35,036 --> 00:11:36,828
my belly.

103
00:11:38,206 --> 00:11:40,415
I can't see anymore.

104
00:11:41,876 --> 00:11:43,293
I'm dead.

105
00:11:45,046 --> 00:11:46,713
You're wondering.

106
00:11:48,382 --> 00:11:50,050
I'll tell you.

107
00:11:50,801 --> 00:11:52,052
Death is --

108
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:04,773
Most interesting and informative.

109
00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:08,318
Ruined financially,
wanted by the police,

110
00:12:08,444 --> 00:12:10,445
and now a corpse in our carriage.

111
00:12:10,571 --> 00:12:14,241
We might have made
a better entrance into the capital.

112
00:12:45,648 --> 00:12:47,357
Get inside.

113
00:13:23,853 --> 00:13:27,230
VOGLER'S MAGNETIC
HEALTH THEATER

114
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:28,893
All of you keep quiet.
I'll do the talking.

115
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:36,025
I must especially ask Granny
to keep her trap shut.

116
00:15:36,152 --> 00:15:39,738
And another thing:
Granny can make things jump around.

117
00:15:39,864 --> 00:15:41,906
Granny knows what I mean.

118
00:15:42,032 --> 00:15:45,660
Tables go flying,
chairs fall over, lights go out.

119
00:15:45,786 --> 00:15:49,539
We all know Granny's tricks.
But be good and behave...

120
00:15:50,124 --> 00:15:51,958
for all our sakes.

121
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:53,960
I understand...

122
00:15:54,295 --> 00:15:55,628
perhaps.

123
00:15:55,755 --> 00:15:58,465
God, this old woman
makes me nervous.

124
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:01,259
Remember what you did
in Ostend?

125
00:16:01,385 --> 00:16:04,304
No, I don't believe I do.

126
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,514
Granny's tricks are out of date.

127
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,225
They're not amusing,
as they can't be explained.

128
00:16:09,351 --> 00:16:11,478
Granny ought to be dead.

129
00:16:11,645 --> 00:16:15,148
Ah, those were merry times
in Ostend.

130
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:18,359
I was thrown in the clink,
Vogler was fined,

131
00:16:18,486 --> 00:16:20,445
and Granny was flogged
in the square.

132
00:16:20,571 --> 00:16:23,448
Yes, those were merry times
in Ostend!

133
00:16:46,222 --> 00:16:48,723
Perhaps we should
introduce ourselves.

134
00:16:48,849 --> 00:16:50,517
Of course.

135
00:16:50,851 --> 00:16:54,687
I am Consul Abraham Egerman.
Welcome to my house.

136
00:16:55,022 --> 00:16:59,442
I, and particularly my wife, have
a great interest in spiritual matters,

137
00:16:59,568 --> 00:17:03,822
so we asked Police Chief Starbeck
to arrange this meeting here.

138
00:17:03,948 --> 00:17:08,159
Frans Starbeck, chief of police.
I arranged this meeting.

139
00:17:08,285 --> 00:17:13,206
I hope my men treated you
with all due respect.

140
00:17:16,377 --> 00:17:19,087
Vergèrus,
Royal Medical Adviser.

141
00:17:24,468 --> 00:17:28,888
It's only proper that
we introduce ourselves as well.

142
00:17:29,056 --> 00:17:31,516
First and foremost,
our leader,

143
00:17:31,642 --> 00:17:33,726
Albert Emanuel Vogler,

144
00:17:33,894 --> 00:17:36,145
a big name on the continent.

145
00:17:36,272 --> 00:17:38,690
Mr. Vogler has ingeniously

146
00:17:38,816 --> 00:17:43,987
developed and perfected
the science of animal magnetism.

147
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:47,532
Most pleased to make
Mr. Vogler's acquaintance.

148
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:54,664
This is Mr. Vogler's young ward
and foremost pupil,

149
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,457
Mr. Aman.

150
00:17:56,584 --> 00:17:59,711
He's displayed
the most remarkable gifts.

151
00:17:59,837 --> 00:18:03,798
This venerable old lady
is Mr. Vogler's grandmother,

152
00:18:03,924 --> 00:18:06,676
once a celebrated opera singer.

153
00:18:08,095 --> 00:18:12,056
Who does not recall
Countess Agata de Macopazza?

154
00:18:15,269 --> 00:18:17,854
I myself count for nothing here.

155
00:18:18,314 --> 00:18:21,608
My humble self
has found its life's work

156
00:18:21,775 --> 00:18:26,487
in serving the great spirit bearing
the name Albert Emanuel Vogler.

157
00:18:26,614 --> 00:18:29,657
Would Dr. Vogler object
to discussing

158
00:18:29,783 --> 00:18:34,037
certain general questions
concerning his activities?

159
00:18:35,664 --> 00:18:37,248
Well then...

160
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,125
kindly be seated.

161
00:18:47,468 --> 00:18:52,555
Dr. Vogler, in our town's chronicles
you advertised

162
00:18:52,681 --> 00:18:55,224
a performance promising
all manner of thrills.

163
00:18:55,643 --> 00:18:59,979
"Sensational marvels
never seen before.

164
00:19:00,147 --> 00:19:04,692
Magical acts derived from
the philosophies of the Orient.

165
00:19:05,903 --> 00:19:09,322
Health-giving magnets,
and spine-tingling thrills

166
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:11,532
for the senses."

167
00:19:11,659 --> 00:19:13,660
Is that your announcement?

168
00:19:13,827 --> 00:19:17,830
Sir, these ostentatious formulations,
offensive to any educated mind,

169
00:19:17,998 --> 00:19:20,166
are not the work
of Dr. Vogler's hand.

170
00:19:21,043 --> 00:19:26,005
We'd be grateful if the doctor
himself would answer the question.

171
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,841
Mr. Vogler is deprived
of the gift of speech.

172
00:19:31,095 --> 00:19:33,012
He is mute, gentlemen.

173
00:19:35,349 --> 00:19:38,810
Is Mr. Aman deprived
of the gift of speech as well?

174
00:19:40,771 --> 00:19:41,604
No.

175
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:43,314
You've said nothing so far.

176
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,485
I haven't been addressed,
Mr. Chief of Police.

177
00:19:48,362 --> 00:19:51,280
So you hold magic sèances?

178
00:19:51,407 --> 00:19:55,201
- We didn't say that.
- Your friend, Mr. Tubal --

179
00:19:55,369 --> 00:19:57,537
We use apparatus,
mirrors, and projections.

180
00:19:57,705 --> 00:19:59,706
It's simple
and perfectly harmless.

181
00:20:00,082 --> 00:20:02,792
Another question:
Does Mr. Vogler heal the sick?

182
00:20:04,378 --> 00:20:06,212
We didn't say that.

183
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:10,008
Mr. Vogler recently toured Denmark
under another name,

184
00:20:10,134 --> 00:20:14,053
posing as a doctor and holding
consultations in local inns.

185
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:17,015
"Patients were placed
in a dim room

186
00:20:17,141 --> 00:20:20,143
and magnetized following
Mesmer's principles.

187
00:20:20,269 --> 00:20:22,645
This led to spasms
and nervous attacks

188
00:20:22,771 --> 00:20:24,480
of various types.

189
00:20:25,024 --> 00:20:27,025
Some lost consciousness."

190
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:30,403
Why ask if you already know?

191
00:20:31,447 --> 00:20:36,576
There seems to be a most remarkable
dichotomy in Mr. Vogler's activities.

192
00:20:36,744 --> 00:20:38,745
What do you mean?

193
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:42,290
There's the idealistic
"Doctor" Vogler,

194
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:46,711
who practices medicine using
Mesmer's dubious methods.

195
00:20:46,837 --> 00:20:50,673
Then there's the rather less savory
Vogler the magician,

196
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:55,511
who performs all sorts
of homemade hocus-pocus.

197
00:20:55,637 --> 00:20:59,682
lf I understand correctly, Vogler's
activities fluctuate unscrupulously

198
00:20:59,808 --> 00:21:03,436
between these two... extremes.

199
00:21:03,812 --> 00:21:08,649
Tell me: Does Mr. Vogler
claim supernatural powers?

200
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:13,571
This pointless interrogation
is degrading to all parties involved.

201
00:21:13,697 --> 00:21:15,782
lf we've acted unlawfully --

202
00:21:15,949 --> 00:21:18,576
That's precisely
what we mean to find out.

203
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,789
Forgive me. I didn't know.

204
00:21:22,915 --> 00:21:25,208
Come sit down, my dear child.

205
00:21:25,959 --> 00:21:27,752
Gentlemen, may I introduce

206
00:21:27,878 --> 00:21:29,629
my wife.

207
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:39,680
Mr. Vogler, I'm sorry to say

208
00:21:39,807 --> 00:21:42,225
that what we've heard so far

209
00:21:42,351 --> 00:21:45,478
hardly inspires confidence.

210
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:53,986
Bring that lamp over here.

211
00:21:55,697 --> 00:21:57,490
Hold it right there.

212
00:21:58,951 --> 00:22:00,993
Look at me, Mr. Vogler.

213
00:22:02,663 --> 00:22:05,123
Why such a furious look?

214
00:22:05,415 --> 00:22:07,750
You have no reason to hate me.

215
00:22:07,876 --> 00:22:12,130
I only wish to ascertain the truth.
That should be your wish as well.

216
00:22:18,846 --> 00:22:20,513
Open your mouth.

217
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:24,016
Stick out your tongue.

218
00:22:39,324 --> 00:22:40,867
I'm sorry, Mr. Vogler,

219
00:22:41,034 --> 00:22:43,536
but I find no reason
for your muteness.

220
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:50,084
Your advertisement
further states that you can

221
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:55,715
"provoke terrifying visions
among your audience."

222
00:22:55,883 --> 00:23:01,429
Sir, that's our magic lantern,
a silly and harmless toy.

223
00:23:01,555 --> 00:23:04,348
I'm not so certain
a toy is the issue here.

224
00:23:07,394 --> 00:23:09,312
Can you provoke visions?

225
00:23:09,438 --> 00:23:11,480
- I protest.
- Why, may I ask?

226
00:23:11,607 --> 00:23:16,861
Dr. Vogler is a great man
and an eminent scientist.

227
00:23:17,321 --> 00:23:19,614
You're treating him
like a charlatan.

228
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:24,076
It's those around him that
make one doubt his scientific merit.

229
00:23:25,078 --> 00:23:27,079
Do you provoke visions?
- I protest --

230
00:23:27,247 --> 00:23:29,874
Silence or I'll ask you to leave!

231
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,667
Well, Mr. Vogler?

232
00:23:32,002 --> 00:23:38,799
Yes or no?

233
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,680
So it's yes.

234
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:48,434
Can you induce this state
in anyone?

235
00:23:51,605 --> 00:23:53,439
Me, perhaps?

236
00:23:57,819 --> 00:24:01,113
Let's conduct an experiment.
I'm at your disposal.

237
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:04,033
No, you mustn't.

238
00:24:04,368 --> 00:24:06,077
Why not, Mrs. Egerman?

239
00:24:06,662 --> 00:24:09,121
Forgive me.

240
00:24:15,837 --> 00:24:18,172
No other arrangements needed?

241
00:24:18,632 --> 00:24:21,217
No magnets?
No mysterious dimmed lights?

242
00:24:22,636 --> 00:24:27,223
No strains from a glass harmonica
hidden behind the curtains?

243
00:24:31,353 --> 00:24:33,729
What would you have me see?

244
00:24:33,855 --> 00:24:36,065
Something frightening or exciting?

245
00:24:39,111 --> 00:24:41,320
They must be weak vessels.

246
00:24:42,322 --> 00:24:44,657
Weak vessels and weak souls.

247
00:24:46,451 --> 00:24:50,121
You're straining.
Careful. Try no more.

248
00:24:51,665 --> 00:24:54,500
You think I hate you.
You're wrong.

249
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:57,670
I'm interested in one thing only:

250
00:24:58,547 --> 00:25:01,299
your physiology, Mr. Vogler.

251
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:04,844
I'd like to perform
an autopsy on you:

252
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:09,098
weigh your brain,
open up your heart,

253
00:25:09,224 --> 00:25:11,225
study your nervous system...

254
00:25:18,108 --> 00:25:20,109
take out your eyes.

255
00:25:27,534 --> 00:25:30,202
Stop before it's too late.

256
00:25:31,538 --> 00:25:33,039
Too late?

257
00:25:33,165 --> 00:25:35,166
Too tedious, you mean.

258
00:25:37,377 --> 00:25:39,962
You failed, Mr. Vogler,

259
00:25:40,088 --> 00:25:43,424
but you should be grateful
for your fiasco. You're harmless.

260
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:46,135
Why are you lying?

261
00:25:46,386 --> 00:25:49,597
- I don't understand.
- We can see you're lying.

262
00:25:49,723 --> 00:25:53,934
Something frightened you terribly,
but you don't dare say what it was.

263
00:25:54,269 --> 00:25:57,104
Sorry, Mrs. Egerman.
I have nothing to hide,

264
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:59,357
no prestige to protect.

265
00:25:59,483 --> 00:26:03,694
Who knows? Perhaps I regret
the fact I felt nothing.

266
00:26:04,154 --> 00:26:06,155
Everything's all right, then?

267
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:10,284
Then you only need my permission

268
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:14,246
to hold your "magnetic entertainment."

269
00:26:14,456 --> 00:26:15,539
But sir --

270
00:26:15,665 --> 00:26:18,501
Mr. Vogler will perform privately

271
00:26:18,627 --> 00:26:21,545
at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow
in Mr. Egerman's drawing room.

272
00:26:21,671 --> 00:26:26,509
Just as a check. In broad daylight.
Any objections, Mr. Tubal?

273
00:26:27,969 --> 00:26:28,969
Splendid.

274
00:26:34,267 --> 00:26:38,062
- Supper will be served in an hour.
- It is a great honor --

275
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:43,526
I'm sorry. Mr. Vogler and company
will eat in the kitchen.

276
00:26:43,652 --> 00:26:45,653
Mrs. Garp will show you
your quarters.

277
00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:48,572
Rustan, show our guests
to the kitchen.

278
00:26:48,698 --> 00:26:51,158
Perhaps we'd prefer
to stay in town.

279
00:26:51,284 --> 00:26:56,038
The police chief insists that Mr. Vogler
and company be our guests.

280
00:27:22,149 --> 00:27:25,568
- Quite an amusing game.
- What do you mean?

281
00:27:25,694 --> 00:27:28,821
lsn't it amusing to humiliate
defenseless people?

282
00:27:28,989 --> 00:27:30,406
You don't understand.

283
00:27:30,532 --> 00:27:34,785
Mr. Vergèrus and I made a wager
on a question of great scientific interest.

284
00:27:34,911 --> 00:27:37,413
- A wager?
- That's right.

285
00:27:37,539 --> 00:27:43,794
Your husband maintains that intangible,
inexplicable forces really do exist.

286
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:45,921
And you deny that possibility?

287
00:27:46,047 --> 00:27:49,425
To accept the inexplicable would be
a catastrophe for science.

288
00:27:49,593 --> 00:27:51,260
A grotesque thought.

289
00:27:51,386 --> 00:27:56,724
By all logic we'd be suddenly
forced to reckon with --

290
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:58,934
- A god.
- lf you like.

291
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,769
How out of date!

292
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:03,522
Science today is
better equipped than ever

293
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:07,359
to penetrate all seeming mysteries.
- Seeming?

294
00:28:07,486 --> 00:28:09,862
- Everything can be explained.
- You're very optimistic.

295
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:12,031
Think of electricity,
steam engines.

296
00:28:12,199 --> 00:28:14,617
Then our wager stands?

297
00:28:14,743 --> 00:28:16,619
We shall see tomorrow.

298
00:28:21,374 --> 00:28:25,669
Your wife seems agitated.
Is the child's death still --

299
00:28:25,795 --> 00:28:28,881
We're going abroad this fall,
and I hope --

300
00:28:29,257 --> 00:28:31,217
Cheers, gentlemen.

301
00:28:31,468 --> 00:28:34,178
To Dr. Vogler
and his magnetic troupe.

302
00:28:34,304 --> 00:28:37,890
A troupe with an exceptionally
troubled conscience!

303
00:28:45,941 --> 00:28:49,693
We must be on our guard.
They look ghastly.

304
00:28:49,819 --> 00:28:52,404
You're too young
to understand, Sanna.

305
00:28:52,531 --> 00:28:55,699
The magician is mute.
He hasn't said a word.

306
00:28:55,825 --> 00:28:57,826
Rustan says he's pretending.

307
00:28:57,953 --> 00:29:00,538
That's even worse.
I'm so frightened.

308
00:29:11,967 --> 00:29:16,262
Anyway, they have no money.
You need only fear the rich.

309
00:29:16,429 --> 00:29:18,556
It's ghastly that they're poor.

310
00:29:18,682 --> 00:29:21,433
What if they kill us
and steal the master's money?

311
00:29:21,768 --> 00:29:23,310
Good evening...

312
00:29:23,436 --> 00:29:25,145
little maids.

313
00:29:26,606 --> 00:29:31,318
My name is simply Tubal,
simple as a folk tune.

314
00:29:31,736 --> 00:29:33,237
Let's see now.

315
00:29:33,363 --> 00:29:36,156
That's Sara and this is Sanna.

316
00:29:36,283 --> 00:29:37,950
Is that so?

317
00:29:38,285 --> 00:29:41,078
Now I know. That's Sanna...

318
00:29:41,204 --> 00:29:42,621
and this is Sara.

319
00:29:42,747 --> 00:29:45,666
- You think so?
- We'll find out.

320
00:29:46,126 --> 00:29:49,378
In a word,
we're invited for supper.

321
00:29:49,504 --> 00:29:52,506
Here are the preparations,
and here are the guests.

322
00:29:52,632 --> 00:29:54,425
Shall we sit down?

323
00:29:57,804 --> 00:29:59,513
My lady.

324
00:29:59,639 --> 00:30:02,141
Sofia Garp, the cook.

325
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:05,603
I am delighted, flattered,
and overwhelmed,

326
00:30:05,729 --> 00:30:08,480
not to mention captivated.

327
00:30:21,328 --> 00:30:22,995
Delighted.

328
00:30:23,705 --> 00:30:25,289
Charmed.

329
00:30:37,761 --> 00:30:39,511
Can Mr. Tubal tell fortunes?

330
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:41,847
Mr. Tubal can indeed.

331
00:30:42,015 --> 00:30:44,058
Read my palm!

332
00:30:44,851 --> 00:30:46,935
My dear child,

333
00:30:47,062 --> 00:30:49,521
you're much too young
and full of hope.

334
00:30:49,689 --> 00:30:51,899
I wouldn't want
to stifle your curiosity,

335
00:30:52,025 --> 00:30:55,611
your joy in life,
your childish faith.

336
00:30:55,737 --> 00:30:59,698
One can sense
Mr. Tubal's supernatural powers.

337
00:30:59,824 --> 00:31:02,159
Yes, indeed.

338
00:31:02,285 --> 00:31:04,370
It's a wonderful gift.

339
00:31:04,537 --> 00:31:07,623
But heavy
and hard to bear, Sofia.

340
00:31:08,124 --> 00:31:10,084
Gracious, Mr. Tubal!

341
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:13,545
It makes one hot
under the corset,

342
00:31:13,713 --> 00:31:15,714
yet cool at the same time.

343
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,467
Dear Mr. Tubal,
do tell my fortune.

344
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:25,724
That's Antonsson, the coachman.

345
00:31:25,892 --> 00:31:28,894
At your service, Antonsson.
We've met.

346
00:31:29,896 --> 00:31:31,063
Evening.

347
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:33,524
Quiet.
He's predicting the future.

348
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:35,859
Quiet, quiet, quiet...

349
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,737
I see a light.

350
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:41,740
Now it's been put out.
It's dark.

351
00:31:41,866 --> 00:31:44,243
I hear sweet words of love.

352
00:31:44,411 --> 00:31:48,914
No, I can't repeat them.
My sense of decency forbids me.

353
00:31:49,124 --> 00:31:53,669
A young man rides
at full gallop. It's beautiful.

354
00:31:54,087 --> 00:31:56,046
Sara, my child...

355
00:31:56,172 --> 00:31:58,924
before you go celebrate
your feast of love,

356
00:31:59,092 --> 00:32:01,468
take a few drops
of our love potion.

357
00:32:01,594 --> 00:32:04,179
Your delight will be
multiplied sevenfold.

358
00:32:04,305 --> 00:32:07,975
It's a gift from Venus Aphrodite.

359
00:32:08,309 --> 00:32:10,561
Tubal is but her humble messenger.

360
00:32:10,687 --> 00:32:12,563
A love potion!

361
00:32:12,689 --> 00:32:15,566
- Is it expensive?
- It is costly,

362
00:32:15,692 --> 00:32:18,485
for it's well-nigh
impossible to procure,

363
00:32:18,611 --> 00:32:21,071
and only then
under the greatest hardship.

364
00:32:21,197 --> 00:32:22,948
And yet you dared!

365
00:32:23,116 --> 00:32:26,118
In the name of science...
and of love.

366
00:32:26,244 --> 00:32:28,662
Might I buy a bottle?

367
00:32:28,788 --> 00:32:30,664
lmpossible.

368
00:32:30,915 --> 00:32:34,084
Your means
are far too modest, Sofia.

369
00:32:34,753 --> 00:32:39,465
These potions are only affordable
for princesses, countesses,

370
00:32:39,591 --> 00:32:42,301
and a leading actress or two.

371
00:32:42,469 --> 00:32:45,679
But for you, Sofia,
because of your beauty,

372
00:32:45,805 --> 00:32:49,975
and your great hospitality
and courtesy,

373
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:53,937
let's say 1 3 shillings,
or two bottles for 20.

374
00:32:57,734 --> 00:33:01,445
It smells so strong!

375
00:33:01,571 --> 00:33:03,906
It is the fluidum itself.

376
00:33:04,032 --> 00:33:08,243
Passion in material form,
to speak scientifically.

377
00:33:08,369 --> 00:33:11,955
- Is it good for men too?
- Not merely good.

378
00:33:12,081 --> 00:33:13,874
Venus Aphrodite

379
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,836
touches their hearts with her fingertips
and sets the devil loose!

380
00:33:17,962 --> 00:33:20,672
Dear God, if Mother was here!

381
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:34,102
We're out of love potion.
What now?

382
00:33:35,522 --> 00:33:38,357
Take this one,
for colic and bunions.

383
00:33:38,942 --> 00:33:41,276
What matters is
how the bottle looks

384
00:33:41,402 --> 00:33:43,570
and how the potion tastes.

385
00:33:46,741 --> 00:33:50,494
- You're a fraud, of course.
- Of course, Sofia.

386
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:54,081
But you must admit
I have a certain something.

387
00:33:54,207 --> 00:33:57,709
I was just thinking that myself.
You'd make a good preacher.

388
00:33:57,877 --> 00:34:00,712
- My faith is shaky.
- Perhaps you're right.

389
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:03,215
This calls for a private discussion.

390
00:34:03,883 --> 00:34:05,676
I'm going to my room.

391
00:34:05,802 --> 00:34:09,221
In a few minutes, go outside,
then around to the right.

392
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:12,307
There's a small door there.
I'll let you in.

393
00:34:12,725 --> 00:34:15,102
You're a real woman, Sofia.

394
00:34:15,228 --> 00:34:16,728
Perhaps.

395
00:34:16,896 --> 00:34:19,273
My husband died eight years ago.

396
00:34:20,567 --> 00:34:22,651
Don't you want your bottles?

397
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:24,862
Keep them.

398
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:27,281
You can sell them again.

399
00:34:30,577 --> 00:34:34,288
Marry Sofia?

400
00:34:35,081 --> 00:34:38,125
Hallelujah,
brothers and sisters.

401
00:34:38,251 --> 00:34:41,795
It's a possibility.
The main thing isn't faith but power.

402
00:34:41,921 --> 00:34:44,089
Sofia felt the power.

403
00:34:45,133 --> 00:34:47,134
What can I get for this shilling?

404
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:50,762
A night of love
you'll never forget, you big dolt.

405
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:54,725
No, that's rat poison.

406
00:34:54,851 --> 00:34:56,852
It won't kill the boy.

407
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:01,064
Drink it in one gulp
and enjoy greater bliss

408
00:35:01,274 --> 00:35:04,651
than Solomon frolicking
with his thousand concubines.

409
00:35:23,379 --> 00:35:26,173
Why do you cry, my little ant?

410
00:35:26,299 --> 00:35:27,966
Are you a witch?

411
00:35:28,092 --> 00:35:30,802
Perhaps I am.

412
00:35:31,346 --> 00:35:33,639
I'm so scared
of all that's happening,

413
00:35:33,765 --> 00:35:35,766
and you're so old and ugly.

414
00:35:35,892 --> 00:35:41,146
You'll be ugly too
when you're almost 200 years old.

415
00:35:41,397 --> 00:35:44,316
- Are you really that old?
- Yes, indeed.

416
00:35:44,484 --> 00:35:47,611
- Can you cast spells too?
- On occasion.

417
00:35:48,488 --> 00:35:51,490
But nowadays
no one believes in my secrets,

418
00:35:51,658 --> 00:35:53,742
so I must be careful.

419
00:35:53,868 --> 00:35:57,120
Tubal says you mustn't
offend the new faith

420
00:35:57,246 --> 00:36:00,374
or you'll end up in a madhouse.

421
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,626
How did you become a witch?

422
00:36:03,127 --> 00:36:05,128
I can't tell you that.

423
00:36:06,881 --> 00:36:08,882
Did you sell your soul?

424
00:36:09,217 --> 00:36:11,718
Yes, perhaps I did.

425
00:36:12,845 --> 00:36:14,680
Now I'm frightened again.

426
00:36:14,806 --> 00:36:18,100
There, there.
Go climb into bed,

427
00:36:18,226 --> 00:36:21,269
and the witch
will bring you a present.

428
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:25,399
Do as I say, little ant.

429
00:36:26,693 --> 00:36:29,695
I only want the best for you.

430
00:36:29,946 --> 00:36:31,363
Go on now.

431
00:36:39,288 --> 00:36:40,914
What are you staring at?

432
00:36:45,294 --> 00:36:49,756
When I passed the laundry room,
I peered into the darkness there.

433
00:36:50,216 --> 00:36:52,217
In the corner hung a body

434
00:36:52,385 --> 00:36:54,553
with a rope around its throat.

435
00:36:54,929 --> 00:36:58,015
I went closer
to see who it was...

436
00:36:58,933 --> 00:37:02,227
and I recognized him.

437
00:37:04,105 --> 00:37:05,772
I'm not scared of you.

438
00:37:05,898 --> 00:37:10,402
It was a murderer
hanging from that hook.

439
00:37:11,863 --> 00:37:14,823
Yes, that's how it is.

440
00:37:15,908 --> 00:37:17,993
One sees what one sees,

441
00:37:18,703 --> 00:37:21,455
and one knows what one knows.

442
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:25,375
It just doesn't pay
to talk about it.

443
00:37:53,279 --> 00:37:55,322
What a life you lead, Mr. Simson.

444
00:37:55,448 --> 00:37:58,200
Travel, performances, parties --

445
00:37:58,326 --> 00:37:59,826
a life of luxury.

446
00:37:59,952 --> 00:38:02,454
And you meet
beautiful woman, of course.

447
00:38:03,456 --> 00:38:06,500
Women are drawn to magic, Sara.

448
00:38:06,626 --> 00:38:10,879
Especially beautiful,
hot-blooded women of instinct.

449
00:38:11,005 --> 00:38:13,757
Sometimes we even have
to fight them off.

450
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:19,262
I remember a Russian princess

451
00:38:19,388 --> 00:38:22,390
with green eyes
and a lily-white bosom.

452
00:38:23,142 --> 00:38:25,352
But let's change the subject.

453
00:38:27,146 --> 00:38:29,272
You come to know women.

454
00:38:29,398 --> 00:38:31,691
Just one glance,
and everything is revealed.

455
00:38:32,151 --> 00:38:34,778
And to think
I'm sitting here with you.

456
00:38:34,904 --> 00:38:36,363
You're cute.

457
00:38:36,489 --> 00:38:40,575
- You think so?
- And I know what I'm talking about.

458
00:38:41,077 --> 00:38:43,036
You have a lovely mouth,

459
00:38:43,162 --> 00:38:45,997
beautiful eyes,
and a very nice figure.

460
00:38:46,374 --> 00:38:48,208
Mother, help me!

461
00:38:48,334 --> 00:38:49,876
Why are you shouting?

462
00:38:50,002 --> 00:38:53,296
I don't know.
I felt a strange feeling.

463
00:38:53,422 --> 00:38:56,508
Especially in my tummy.
Maybe I'm sick.

464
00:38:57,009 --> 00:39:00,303
- It's the love potion.
- You think so?

465
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:04,432
What are you doing?

466
00:39:07,311 --> 00:39:10,188
Let's each take a swallow,

467
00:39:10,439 --> 00:39:14,192
and Venus Aphrodite
will come and touch us.

468
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:18,321
She's the goddess of love.
Then everything will be bliss.

469
00:39:18,573 --> 00:39:22,951
"One does what one does, and one knows
what one knows," as Granny says.

470
00:39:23,077 --> 00:39:26,580
- I think you're teasing me.
- Not at all, my child.

471
00:39:26,706 --> 00:39:30,292
I'm preparing a wonderful
amusement for us both.

472
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:32,878
And the Russian princess?

473
00:39:33,546 --> 00:39:36,339
Is your bosom any less white?

474
00:39:36,549 --> 00:39:38,592
No, I don't think so.

475
00:39:39,302 --> 00:39:41,511
But her eyes were green.

476
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:45,682
She used to close her eyes.
You can do that too.

477
00:39:45,975 --> 00:39:47,726
Then let's drink.

478
00:39:56,611 --> 00:39:58,445
Now what happens?

479
00:39:58,779 --> 00:40:01,406
Now... we just wait.

480
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:03,116
Here?

481
00:40:03,326 --> 00:40:05,869
Well, perhaps not right here.

482
00:40:05,995 --> 00:40:08,872
I know!
Let's go to the laundry room!

483
00:40:08,998 --> 00:40:13,376
There are nice, big baskets there
full of clean linen.

484
00:40:14,086 --> 00:40:17,255
Maybe... we should just wait here.

485
00:40:17,381 --> 00:40:18,965
For what?

486
00:40:19,091 --> 00:40:23,011
Mr. Vogler might want something.
I think he --

487
00:40:23,638 --> 00:40:26,056
You've turned so pale.

488
00:40:27,016 --> 00:40:28,808
Don't you feel well?

489
00:40:28,935 --> 00:40:34,439
I just remembered that this potion
can affect people very differently.

490
00:40:34,607 --> 00:40:38,401
It can turn some men
into raging lions.

491
00:40:39,111 --> 00:40:43,114
At times I've almost
ripped women apart.

492
00:40:43,241 --> 00:40:44,866
How dreadful!

493
00:40:44,992 --> 00:40:47,369
But I don't want to harm you.

494
00:40:47,495 --> 00:40:50,163
- I won't break.
- I see.

495
00:40:50,289 --> 00:40:53,250
Anyway, it affects
people differently, like I said.

496
00:40:54,085 --> 00:40:57,295
It can even make you nauseous.

497
00:40:58,631 --> 00:41:01,925
I've heard of people who've died.

498
00:41:04,428 --> 00:41:09,808
I think Venus Aphrodite
just touched me the right way.

499
00:41:11,227 --> 00:41:14,604
Maybe so,
but I'm a lot more sensitive.

500
00:41:17,149 --> 00:41:19,526
Don't be so afraid, little Simson.

501
00:41:19,902 --> 00:41:22,070
I won't eat you up.

502
00:41:41,882 --> 00:41:45,635
Look at that.
He just trotted off with her.

503
00:41:47,888 --> 00:41:50,098
She's usually so standoffish.

504
00:41:50,224 --> 00:41:52,517
Drink. You'll feel better.

505
00:42:09,035 --> 00:42:11,036
It's so warm in here.

506
00:42:11,954 --> 00:42:14,122
Doesn't it smell nice?

507
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,335
It's the freshly ironed linen

508
00:42:18,461 --> 00:42:21,629
and the apples stored for winter.

509
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:24,215
There's a bird's nest in the window.

510
00:42:25,551 --> 00:42:27,594
Well, it's very warm.

511
00:42:29,472 --> 00:42:31,765
You're trembling.

512
00:42:31,891 --> 00:42:33,808
It's so hot.

513
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:35,977
Then take off your coat.

514
00:42:41,609 --> 00:42:45,403
I see Rustan and Antonsson
still sitting in the kitchen.

515
00:42:45,654 --> 00:42:49,115
And there's a light on
in Mr. Aman and Mr. Vogler's room.

516
00:42:49,241 --> 00:42:50,867
Sara.

517
00:42:51,202 --> 00:42:53,745
Where are you?
I can't see you.

518
00:42:53,913 --> 00:42:58,500
Here, in the laundry basket,
where you said we should be.

519
00:43:01,003 --> 00:43:02,504
Well?

520
00:43:02,797 --> 00:43:06,216
Of course it would be easy
to seduce you.

521
00:43:06,342 --> 00:43:09,010
- You think so?
- Certainly.

522
00:43:09,136 --> 00:43:13,014
But the years make one older
and more considerate, you understand?

523
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:15,725
Yes, if I try really hard.

524
00:43:15,851 --> 00:43:20,939
One learns not to run around
picking every flower by the wayside.

525
00:43:21,107 --> 00:43:23,608
You can at least smell them.

526
00:43:25,111 --> 00:43:29,697
I just bend over the fragile petals
and then move on.

527
00:43:30,408 --> 00:43:32,409
Why do you talk so much?

528
00:43:34,995 --> 00:43:38,790
I'm afraid of thunder!
- Calm down. You have me.

529
00:43:39,834 --> 00:43:42,627
That's very reassuring.

530
00:43:48,217 --> 00:43:51,594
What is it?
- The love potion.

531
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:54,264
Is the effect really strong?

532
00:43:54,807 --> 00:43:56,891
I'm sweating like a camel!

533
00:43:57,643 --> 00:44:00,562
More thunder!
Hold me tight.

534
00:44:08,446 --> 00:44:11,698
This knot is so tight.

535
00:44:12,324 --> 00:44:14,159
I'll help you.

536
00:44:14,535 --> 00:44:16,953
No, don't look.

537
00:44:21,542 --> 00:44:23,918
Another button to undo?

538
00:44:24,044 --> 00:44:26,129
This is a lot of bother.

539
00:44:30,259 --> 00:44:33,470
You don't seem very experienced,
dear Simson.

540
00:44:33,596 --> 00:44:37,599
Well, I've been abroad
most of the time.

541
00:44:51,530 --> 00:44:53,031
Hush now.

542
00:44:53,199 --> 00:44:56,367
You mustn't be sad, little one.

543
00:44:56,535 --> 00:44:59,245
It will soon be your turn.

544
00:44:59,747 --> 00:45:04,792
But first Granny
has a gift to console you.

545
00:45:06,545 --> 00:45:08,463
Is it an ear?

546
00:45:08,589 --> 00:45:10,298
Yes.

547
00:45:10,716 --> 00:45:14,928
Whisper all your wishes into it

548
00:45:15,054 --> 00:45:17,722
and you'll receive
what you ask for,

549
00:45:17,848 --> 00:45:20,892
but on one condition.
- What's that?

550
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:23,978
You must wish
for things that live,

551
00:45:24,313 --> 00:45:26,981
that are alive
or will come to be.

552
00:45:27,566 --> 00:45:29,359
I don't understand.

553
00:45:29,485 --> 00:45:33,404
No, not right now,
but it doesn't matter.

554
00:45:33,614 --> 00:45:36,491
Hush now, little one,

555
00:45:36,617 --> 00:45:39,577
and I'll sing you a song.

556
00:45:40,412 --> 00:45:44,541
The soldier stood with his gun

557
00:45:45,417 --> 00:45:49,587
In the howling wind
and blinding sun

558
00:45:50,756 --> 00:45:55,218
It was war
and by the enemy stalked

559
00:45:55,553 --> 00:46:00,431
On tired legs the soldier walked

560
00:46:00,975 --> 00:46:05,603
The enemy charged
from the woods that day

561
00:46:05,771 --> 00:46:11,734
Our man stood
in the thick of the fray

562
00:46:12,444 --> 00:46:17,824
Knives flashed
and blood was spilled

563
00:46:18,325 --> 00:46:24,080
Many a warrior there was killed

564
00:46:24,748 --> 00:46:29,210
The soldier's face
with victory was bright

565
00:46:30,045 --> 00:46:34,382
Heavy poured the rain that night

566
00:46:35,342 --> 00:46:40,471
The soldier sat
by himself and wrote

567
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:47,604
To his dearest a lengthy note

568
00:46:50,274 --> 00:46:54,110
Love brings solace

569
00:46:54,862 --> 00:46:58,489
Love brings rest

570
00:46:59,325 --> 00:47:02,702
Love brings strength

571
00:47:03,037 --> 00:47:06,998
To the weakest breast

572
00:47:08,292 --> 00:47:11,878
Love is one

573
00:47:13,213 --> 00:47:17,091
Can ne'er be twain

574
00:47:18,594 --> 00:47:21,888
Love is simple

575
00:47:23,349 --> 00:47:28,353
Yet hard to explain

576
00:47:37,404 --> 00:47:40,031
Did you hear that, little ant?

577
00:47:40,366 --> 00:47:42,533
I'm falling asleep.

578
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:44,369
Yes...

579
00:47:47,164 --> 00:47:49,374
It's going to thunder.

580
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:57,131
Far, far away.

581
00:47:58,050 --> 00:48:00,468
I'm not afraid of thunder.

582
00:48:19,571 --> 00:48:23,574
"I call you down, I call you out,
beyond the dead,

583
00:48:23,701 --> 00:48:27,370
beyond the living,
the living dead,

584
00:48:27,621 --> 00:48:29,956
with their upraised hands..."

585
00:48:54,982 --> 00:48:56,941
That Vogler...

586
00:48:57,192 --> 00:49:00,486
People like that
should be flogged.

587
00:49:03,073 --> 00:49:06,451
There's something peculiar
about conjurors.

588
00:49:10,539 --> 00:49:13,624
Their faces set you on edge.

589
00:49:14,543 --> 00:49:17,211
- Their faces?
- That's right.

590
00:49:19,465 --> 00:49:24,135
A face like Vogler's
makes you furious.

591
00:49:25,471 --> 00:49:27,805
You want to bash it in.

592
00:49:29,349 --> 00:49:31,476
Vogler's face...

593
00:49:33,979 --> 00:49:38,816
There's something peculiar
about a face like that.

594
00:49:40,402 --> 00:49:43,154
Know what I mean, Antonsson?

595
00:49:44,323 --> 00:49:46,991
Someone oughta stomp on it.

596
00:49:51,830 --> 00:49:54,123
Faces like that...

597
00:49:55,542 --> 00:49:57,168
Vogler's...

598
00:49:57,878 --> 00:49:59,921
the old lady's...

599
00:50:01,006 --> 00:50:02,924
and Aman's...

600
00:50:14,895 --> 00:50:17,688
- A ghost!
- Or the devil himself!

601
00:50:17,856 --> 00:50:19,857
Where's the brandy?

602
00:50:21,026 --> 00:50:22,944
The jug's gone!

603
00:50:23,070 --> 00:50:24,737
Is it on the floor?

604
00:50:25,364 --> 00:50:27,406
- No.
- Where is it?

605
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:31,244
The ghost took the brandy!

606
00:50:38,168 --> 00:50:39,961
What are you doing?

607
00:50:40,379 --> 00:50:43,381
Getting ready for the performance
in the morning.

608
00:50:45,092 --> 00:50:48,511
One sees what one sees,
and one knows what one knows.

609
00:50:48,637 --> 00:50:50,513
I don't like the smell of this.

610
00:50:51,598 --> 00:50:54,225
You have only yourselves
to blame.

611
00:51:26,425 --> 00:51:29,635
I hope they fed you
properly in the kitchen.

612
00:51:36,810 --> 00:51:38,769
I'll go unpack.

613
00:51:51,992 --> 00:51:55,411
Perhaps you wonder
why I'm dressed in black.

614
00:51:56,163 --> 00:51:58,456
My daughter died this spring.

615
00:52:05,464 --> 00:52:07,131
Mr. Vogler...

616
00:52:08,008 --> 00:52:11,469
you must forgive them
for humiliating you.

617
00:52:11,803 --> 00:52:15,806
They hate you because
they don't understand you, but I do.

618
00:52:18,477 --> 00:52:20,645
Just who are you?

619
00:52:26,985 --> 00:52:30,905
I recognized you the moment I saw you.
It unnerved me terribly.

620
00:52:31,031 --> 00:52:34,408
Forgive me for being so frank,
but I so rarely speak.

621
00:52:37,996 --> 00:52:42,249
No, I won't cry.
We have no time for tears.

622
00:52:44,419 --> 00:52:46,337
I've longed for you.

623
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:50,466
My thoughts have been constantly
with you. I've lived your life.

624
00:52:50,842 --> 00:52:53,886
Yet today's the first time
I've laid eyes on you.

625
00:52:54,888 --> 00:52:57,515
Perhaps you're silently
laughing at me.

626
00:52:57,641 --> 00:52:59,642
It doesn't matter.

627
00:53:00,102 --> 00:53:02,687
My love is strong enough
for both of us.

628
00:53:03,522 --> 00:53:06,357
Now I understand
why you've come.

629
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:09,151
Feel how my heart is beating.

630
00:53:11,697 --> 00:53:14,573
You're here to explain
why my child died.

631
00:53:16,034 --> 00:53:17,952
What God meant.

632
00:53:18,662 --> 00:53:20,830
That's why you've come.

633
00:53:21,039 --> 00:53:22,999
To ease my sorrow...

634
00:53:24,418 --> 00:53:27,294
and lift the burden off my shoulders.

635
00:53:28,714 --> 00:53:31,257
My poor husband
doesn't know anything.

636
00:53:31,383 --> 00:53:33,509
How could he understand?

637
00:53:37,764 --> 00:53:40,725
lsn't it terribly warm tonight?

638
00:53:42,686 --> 00:53:45,146
I've felt such anguish.

639
00:53:47,858 --> 00:53:50,234
My husband
will go to bed in an hour.

640
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:54,864
He's a heavy sleeper, and I put
a sleeping potion in his drink.

641
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:57,575
Come to me at 2:00.

642
00:53:57,909 --> 00:54:01,245
I'm just across the hall
from your room.

643
00:54:04,583 --> 00:54:06,459
Let me kiss your hand.

644
00:54:06,585 --> 00:54:09,920
No... I want to.

645
00:54:10,255 --> 00:54:12,131
Just be still.

646
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:15,468
You hurt yourself.

647
00:54:21,683 --> 00:54:25,352
My husband and I have had separate
bedrooms since our daughter died.

648
00:55:00,305 --> 00:55:02,306
I didn't really die...

649
00:55:03,433 --> 00:55:06,102
yet I've already begun
haunting people.

650
00:55:07,145 --> 00:55:12,149
Actually, I think I make
a better ghost than human being.

651
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:15,528
I'm finally...

652
00:55:16,863 --> 00:55:19,657
convincing.

653
00:55:22,536 --> 00:55:25,538
Something I never was
as an actor.

654
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:35,840
A shadow...

655
00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:38,843
of a shadow.

656
00:55:45,350 --> 00:55:48,352
Don't be concerned
for my sake, sir.

657
00:55:49,521 --> 00:55:52,231
I've already begun to decompose.

658
00:56:01,366 --> 00:56:05,369
I've prayed
for just one thing in my life.

659
00:56:06,663 --> 00:56:09,373
"Use me.
Make me your servant."

660
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:17,923
But God never understood

661
00:56:18,049 --> 00:56:22,219
what a strong
and devoted slave I was.

662
00:56:23,054 --> 00:56:25,181
So I went unused.

663
00:56:32,105 --> 00:56:34,732
That's a lie too, by the way.

664
00:56:40,572 --> 00:56:42,948
One goes step by step

665
00:56:43,074 --> 00:56:45,242
by step by step

666
00:56:45,368 --> 00:56:47,578
into the darkness.

667
00:56:47,787 --> 00:56:52,374
The movement itself
is the only truth.

668
00:57:33,917 --> 00:57:37,461
When I thought I was dead...

669
00:57:38,964 --> 00:57:44,635
I was tormented
by horrible dreams.

670
00:58:51,911 --> 00:58:56,373
You look pale around the gills.
Seen a ghost?

671
00:58:56,499 --> 00:58:59,877
- Just a little tired.
- Of course. I bid you good night.

672
00:59:00,003 --> 00:59:03,088
My respects to Mrs. Egerman.
- Can you find your room?

673
00:59:03,214 --> 00:59:06,050
I've been the Egermans'
honored guest before.

674
00:59:06,176 --> 00:59:09,219
Let's have another drink!
Come sit down!

675
00:59:10,930 --> 00:59:15,059
When the police chief
gives an order, you obey.

676
01:00:04,442 --> 01:00:07,319
What a singular magnetic marvel!

677
01:00:07,612 --> 01:00:10,614
Dr. Vogler's talents
have my greatest esteem.

678
01:00:11,741 --> 01:00:13,283
I'm his wife.

679
01:00:13,451 --> 01:00:15,452
Then why the disguise?

680
01:00:15,745 --> 01:00:18,122
We're wanted.
We mustn't be recognized.

681
01:00:18,289 --> 01:00:20,290
Why not leave
the whole business?

682
01:00:20,458 --> 01:00:22,292
Where would I go?

683
01:00:22,794 --> 01:00:24,753
I'll tell you a secret.

684
01:00:24,879 --> 01:00:28,006
I've struggled all evening
with an inexplicable sympathy

685
01:00:28,133 --> 01:00:29,967
for you and your husband.

686
01:00:30,510 --> 01:00:34,304
- That doesn't sound likely.
- I took an immediate liking to you.

687
01:00:34,848 --> 01:00:38,058
Your faces, your silence,
your natural dignity.

688
01:00:39,185 --> 01:00:42,479
I only admit the deplorable fact
because I'm tipsy.

689
01:00:42,647 --> 01:00:44,440
Then leave us alone.

690
01:00:44,566 --> 01:00:46,483
- I can't.
- Why not?

691
01:00:47,152 --> 01:00:50,487
Because you represent
what I despise most of all.

692
01:00:51,781 --> 01:00:53,615
The inexplicable.

693
01:00:55,869 --> 01:00:58,912
Then you can cease
your persecution.

694
01:00:59,205 --> 01:01:02,332
Our entire act is a fraud
from start to finish.

695
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:04,168
Fraud?

696
01:01:05,086 --> 01:01:09,173
Pretense, false promises,
double bottoms.

697
01:01:10,508 --> 01:01:13,302
A miserable, rotten lie
through and through.

698
01:01:14,262 --> 01:01:17,264
We're the most pathetic rabble
you could find.

699
01:01:17,390 --> 01:01:19,475
Does your husband
share your opinion?

700
01:01:19,601 --> 01:01:22,019
- He doesn't speak.
- Is that true?

701
01:01:22,687 --> 01:01:24,605
Nothing is true.

702
01:01:24,731 --> 01:01:29,151
He has no secret powers?
No, perhaps not.

703
01:01:29,277 --> 01:01:33,572
I felt nothing but a certain
cool excitement. He failed.

704
01:01:34,866 --> 01:01:38,202
- It's meaningless.
- So I can put my mind at ease?

705
01:01:38,369 --> 01:01:40,537
Yes, put your mind at ease.

706
01:01:41,331 --> 01:01:44,333
We can demonstrate our incompetence
as often as you like.

707
01:01:44,459 --> 01:01:47,294
You seem to regret that fact...

708
01:01:49,214 --> 01:01:51,381
and wish it were otherwise.

709
01:01:52,091 --> 01:01:54,218
But there are no miracles.

710
01:01:54,344 --> 01:01:57,971
It's always the props and the patter
that must do the work.

711
01:01:58,097 --> 01:02:02,643
The clergy's in the same sad boat.
God is silent while men babble on.

712
01:02:03,394 --> 01:02:05,145
lf just once...

713
01:02:05,271 --> 01:02:07,856
That's what they all say.
"lf just once..."

714
01:02:07,982 --> 01:02:11,443
For the nonbelievers,
but especially for the believers.

715
01:02:11,903 --> 01:02:13,654
"lf just once..."

716
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:16,406
lf just once... It's true.

717
01:02:18,243 --> 01:02:20,244
You say you're afraid?

718
01:02:21,955 --> 01:02:24,248
Of me too?
- Especially of you.

719
01:02:24,624 --> 01:02:26,375
That's flattering.

720
01:02:26,668 --> 01:02:29,461
One can tolerate
your manner and intelligence.

721
01:02:29,587 --> 01:02:31,380
Then what frightens you?

722
01:02:31,506 --> 01:02:33,590
Your smile. Your kindness.

723
01:02:38,513 --> 01:02:42,099
You're probably the only sensible one
in the whole troupe.

724
01:02:42,267 --> 01:02:46,436
Why continue down this road
to disgrace and prison?

725
01:02:48,648 --> 01:02:50,691
It hasn't always been this way?

726
01:02:50,942 --> 01:02:52,317
No.

727
01:02:52,443 --> 01:02:54,444
Perhaps you once believed...

728
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:58,448
that there was some point,
that it had some meaning?

729
01:02:58,866 --> 01:03:00,867
A long time ago.

730
01:03:01,536 --> 01:03:04,037
Why not stop
while there's still time?

731
01:03:04,163 --> 01:03:05,872
It's no use.

732
01:03:06,457 --> 01:03:09,293
- You mean that your husband --
- I mean it's no use.

733
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:14,965
There's no way back or sideways.
Not for us.

734
01:03:15,091 --> 01:03:17,301
Nevertheless,
I have a proposition.

735
01:03:17,677 --> 01:03:21,305
When you tire of your magnets,
you can look me up.

736
01:03:21,806 --> 01:03:23,807
I promise to help you

737
01:03:24,017 --> 01:03:25,851
one way or another.

738
01:03:26,311 --> 01:03:28,312
And my husband?

739
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:30,981
I'm very grateful.

740
01:03:31,524 --> 01:03:33,400
I'm just leaving.

741
01:03:41,826 --> 01:03:45,412
One last question:
Any more masks to come off,

742
01:03:45,538 --> 01:03:49,499
or has Dr. Vogler's Magical Theater
exhausted its resources?

743
01:04:05,975 --> 01:04:08,852
You do me far too great
an honor, Doctor.

744
01:04:09,437 --> 01:04:11,855
Your wife's faithfulness
borders on madness.

745
01:04:12,023 --> 01:04:13,815
Go now, for God's sake.

746
01:04:14,025 --> 01:04:16,151
You think your husband
wants to kill me?

747
01:04:16,277 --> 01:04:18,528
Do you want to kill me,
Mr. Vogler?

748
01:04:18,863 --> 01:04:22,032
You hate me. I like you.
Quite stimulating.

749
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:24,868
- Won't you kindly leave.
- I shall leave.

750
01:04:25,370 --> 01:04:27,120
Good night, madame.

751
01:04:27,580 --> 01:04:30,374
Good night, Doctor!

752
01:05:55,126 --> 01:05:58,587
Remember in Lyon
when we earned lots of money,

753
01:05:58,713 --> 01:06:02,716
bought a country house,
and intended to stop traveling?

754
01:06:04,302 --> 01:06:08,096
Then we sold the property
and bought the carriage and horses.

755
01:06:08,931 --> 01:06:11,266
That's when
you started acting mute.

756
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:18,356
Remember the grand duke in Köten
who was so taken by me

757
01:06:18,483 --> 01:06:22,486
that he promised to recommend us
to His Majesty in Sweden?

758
01:06:24,697 --> 01:06:28,700
You thought I'd been unfaithful,
and you gave the duke a thrashing.

759
01:06:29,410 --> 01:06:33,455
We sat in prison for two months
until he forgave us.

760
01:06:35,750 --> 01:06:37,751
He was very magnanimous

761
01:06:37,877 --> 01:06:41,213
and promised to recommend us
to the Swedish court anyway.

762
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:43,507
Do you think he did?

763
01:06:44,509 --> 01:06:46,510
No, I don't think so either.

764
01:06:46,636 --> 01:06:48,428
I hate them.

765
01:06:48,679 --> 01:06:51,848
I hate their faces, their bodies,

766
01:06:51,974 --> 01:06:54,351
their movements, their voices.

767
01:06:57,605 --> 01:07:01,399
But I get frightened too,
and then I lose my power.

768
01:07:03,528 --> 01:07:05,529
What if I left you?

769
01:07:06,531 --> 01:07:08,490
Go on, if you want.

770
01:07:08,866 --> 01:07:10,867
It makes no difference.

771
01:07:12,745 --> 01:07:14,287
Albert...

772
01:07:15,373 --> 01:07:16,998
Emanuel...

773
01:07:17,708 --> 01:07:19,209
Vogler.

774
01:07:30,721 --> 01:07:32,347
You came after all.

775
01:07:42,066 --> 01:07:44,067
What are you going to do?

776
01:07:46,529 --> 01:07:48,321
It wasn't my doing.

777
01:07:49,115 --> 01:07:51,533
It was him who seduced me.

778
01:07:55,580 --> 01:07:57,372
Are you going to strike me?

779
01:08:00,501 --> 01:08:04,087
No, you wouldn't dare.
You're a coward.

780
01:08:26,944 --> 01:08:28,612
It's bleeding.

781
01:08:29,238 --> 01:08:32,616
Forgive me. I'm sorry.

782
01:08:32,825 --> 01:08:34,367
No.

783
01:08:34,619 --> 01:08:36,286
Don't go.

784
01:09:22,583 --> 01:09:25,001
We thank you for your applause

785
01:09:25,169 --> 01:09:27,837
and hope you're enjoying
our little tricks.

786
01:09:37,431 --> 01:09:39,849
And now,
for an unprecedented number

787
01:09:39,976 --> 01:09:41,977
that's won worldwide acclaim

788
01:09:42,103 --> 01:09:46,481
wherein Mr. Vogler's extraordinary
powers give even more tangible proof

789
01:09:46,649 --> 01:09:49,359
of the diabolical powers
behind our world order.

790
01:09:49,527 --> 01:09:52,904
Will one of the ladies
step forward?

791
01:09:53,030 --> 01:09:58,159
A woman of pure heart
and beautiful thoughts.

792
01:09:58,452 --> 01:10:00,787
Madame Chief of Police?

793
01:10:12,550 --> 01:10:16,261
This is the absolute

794
01:10:16,387 --> 01:10:20,265
and unprecedented
moment of truth.

795
01:10:20,558 --> 01:10:22,726
Through the power
of these magnets,

796
01:10:22,893 --> 01:10:25,895
Mrs. Starbeck will be freed
of all pretense,

797
01:10:26,063 --> 01:10:30,066
and every word she utters
will be the purest truth.

798
01:10:34,155 --> 01:10:38,033
Mrs. Starbeck, how much pocket money
does your husband give you?

799
01:10:38,159 --> 01:10:40,160
I object to this prank!

800
01:10:40,286 --> 01:10:44,205
Just a moment, sir. Don't forget
this is in the service of science.

801
01:10:44,707 --> 01:10:46,916
What year did you marry?

802
01:10:47,043 --> 01:10:50,295
I'm not married.
How frightful! I'm far too young!

803
01:10:50,421 --> 01:10:53,757
- You're not married?
- Mr. Starbeck is a carrot.

804
01:10:53,883 --> 01:10:56,384
Stop this disgraceful performance!

805
01:10:56,510 --> 01:10:58,553
He goes to a whorehouse
every Saturday.

806
01:10:58,679 --> 01:11:00,680
He eats like a pig
and farts at the table.

807
01:11:00,806 --> 01:11:03,725
Didn't you hear me?
Stop her!

808
01:11:03,851 --> 01:11:07,353
He wears a wig.
He's smelly and repulsive.

809
01:11:07,772 --> 01:11:11,524
Couldn't you at least think
of our poor children?

810
01:11:11,650 --> 01:11:15,028
I've often wondered how many of them
are really Starbeck's,

811
01:11:15,154 --> 01:11:17,614
though a few
are indeed stupid and ugly.

812
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:19,741
Mr. Starbeck is a pig!

813
01:11:26,457 --> 01:11:29,125
I must go home at once.
I have a roast in the oven.

814
01:11:29,293 --> 01:11:30,710
You stay, dear.

815
01:11:30,836 --> 01:11:33,254
You need a little diversion.

816
01:11:39,053 --> 01:11:41,262
I didn't say anything silly, did I?

817
01:11:42,264 --> 01:11:45,058
These magicians are remarkable.

818
01:11:45,184 --> 01:11:47,727
You'll be home for dinner,
won't you?

819
01:11:48,729 --> 01:11:52,857
I'm not a spiteful woman.
You mustn't think that.

820
01:11:59,949 --> 01:12:01,950
I can see myself out.

821
01:12:08,374 --> 01:12:11,417
Our final number is called
the lnvisible Chain.

822
01:12:11,544 --> 01:12:14,295
Would one
of the gentlemen volunteer?

823
01:12:14,421 --> 01:12:16,214
The stronger the better.

824
01:12:19,844 --> 01:12:21,511
Antonsson.

825
01:12:23,722 --> 01:12:26,015
- I'd rather not, sir.
- It's an order.

826
01:12:28,519 --> 01:12:31,020
Bravo, my good man.

827
01:12:31,188 --> 01:12:34,315
Nothing dangerous,
nothing harmful.

828
01:12:34,441 --> 01:12:36,693
Just breathe calmly.

829
01:12:36,902 --> 01:12:39,445
Antonsson is a colossus,

830
01:12:39,572 --> 01:12:42,115
but his physical might is nothing

831
01:12:42,241 --> 01:12:46,911
compared to
Mr. Vogler's spiritual power.

832
01:12:48,038 --> 01:12:53,042
Assistant, bind that man
in the invisible chains.

833
01:13:17,735 --> 01:13:20,612
Your hands are chained together...

834
01:13:21,322 --> 01:13:24,073
and your feet are also bound.

835
01:13:26,994 --> 01:13:30,038
And the chains
are fastened to the wall.

836
01:15:28,490 --> 01:15:30,199
After him!

837
01:16:37,810 --> 01:16:40,478
The man is dead.
No doubt about it.

838
01:16:52,449 --> 01:16:55,993
My report will emphasize
that Antonsson bears

839
01:16:56,120 --> 01:16:58,287
little or no guilt in this matter.

840
01:16:58,414 --> 01:17:02,208
Nor can any penalty be expected,
as no relative has pressed charges.

841
01:17:02,334 --> 01:17:06,254
Should that change, the matter
will be carefully investigated,

842
01:17:06,380 --> 01:17:10,091
with special attention
to any claims against Mr. Vogler

843
01:17:10,217 --> 01:17:12,468
in connection
with his activities here,

844
01:17:12,594 --> 01:17:16,472
claims that could amount
to considerable sums.

845
01:17:17,349 --> 01:17:19,392
Any objections?

846
01:17:22,563 --> 01:17:27,233
lf no one finds cause to challenge
the aforementioned report,

847
01:17:27,359 --> 01:17:29,444
the case will be closed.

848
01:17:29,570 --> 01:17:31,446
May I ask what all that means?

849
01:17:31,572 --> 01:17:33,030
It means

850
01:17:33,157 --> 01:17:37,493
that you can go to hell --
if you so please, Mr. Tubal.

851
01:17:37,661 --> 01:17:40,163
I thank you for your advice, sir.

852
01:17:40,789 --> 01:17:42,665
But what happens to Vogler?

853
01:17:43,459 --> 01:17:48,838
Pursuant to the statute re autopsies
in private and public institutions,

854
01:17:48,964 --> 01:17:52,800
an autopsy will be performed
on the said Vogler

855
01:17:52,926 --> 01:17:55,011
in accordance with the decision

856
01:17:55,179 --> 01:17:57,638
of Medical Adviser Vergèrus
and myself.

857
01:17:57,764 --> 01:18:01,309
Said autopsy will be performed
at once at the city's expense

858
01:18:01,435 --> 01:18:03,478
and in the service of science.

859
01:18:03,604 --> 01:18:05,021
We're very grateful.

860
01:18:05,230 --> 01:18:07,231
I thought you would be.

861
01:18:08,734 --> 01:18:12,403
Then it's time to carry
Mr. Vogler up to the attic,

862
01:18:12,529 --> 01:18:14,572
where the autopsy will take place.

863
01:18:14,865 --> 01:18:19,827
For scientific reasons, Mr. Vergèrus
wishes to begin as soon as possible.

864
01:18:20,329 --> 01:18:22,872
Like at executions?

865
01:18:23,373 --> 01:18:24,916
Perhaps so.

866
01:18:25,167 --> 01:18:29,253
We can take him up
in that black trunk you're sitting on.

867
01:18:32,007 --> 01:18:35,843
Should Mrs. Vogler have difficulty
earning a livelihood,

868
01:18:35,969 --> 01:18:40,014
I can recommend an excellent house
where I enjoy some influence.

869
01:18:40,140 --> 01:18:42,141
I appreciate your concern.

870
01:18:42,434 --> 01:18:45,686
My wife had some amusing ideas,
don't you think?

871
01:19:04,414 --> 01:19:07,291
So we carried the coffin
up to the attic.

872
01:19:07,584 --> 01:19:11,254
The medical adviser
and the police chief came in

873
01:19:11,421 --> 01:19:14,423
and lifted Vogler's body up
onto a big table

874
01:19:14,550 --> 01:19:16,551
and started undressing him.

875
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:18,594
What are they actually doing?

876
01:19:18,762 --> 01:19:21,681
They cut up the body,
pull out the innards,

877
01:19:22,140 --> 01:19:24,559
cut off the head,
and peek into the brain.

878
01:19:25,102 --> 01:19:27,603
Blood gushes everywhere.

879
01:19:28,772 --> 01:19:32,817
Just think if he woke up,
rose up from under the knife,

880
01:19:33,110 --> 01:19:37,029
got off the table,
and came downstairs.

881
01:19:37,739 --> 01:19:41,701
Just think if he came in and looked
at us with bloody eye sockets.

882
01:19:41,827 --> 01:19:44,078
There he is!
- Don't say that!

883
01:19:45,038 --> 01:19:48,416
Don't be afraid, Sanna.
I'll protect you.

884
01:19:48,542 --> 01:19:52,461
The best thing is to sing
a song of trust in the Lord.

885
01:19:52,796 --> 01:19:56,173
You're so right, Sofia.
What shall we sing?

886
01:20:04,725 --> 01:20:07,351
- Having second thoughts?
- Second thoughts?

887
01:20:07,477 --> 01:20:09,895
I made no promises.

888
01:20:10,022 --> 01:20:12,148
You sure seemed eager last night.

889
01:20:12,274 --> 01:20:14,150
You trying to embarrass me?

890
01:20:14,318 --> 01:20:17,570
Yesterday was yesterday,
and today is Sunday.

891
01:20:18,989 --> 01:20:22,491
"...and have not found,
as a result of the autopsy,

892
01:20:22,618 --> 01:20:26,078
any physiological peculiarities
or abnormalities,

893
01:20:26,204 --> 01:20:29,749
and must therefore characterize
the phenomena that occurred

894
01:20:29,875 --> 01:20:32,668
in connection with said Vogler
as incidental and meaningless,

895
01:20:33,003 --> 01:20:35,588
or at any rate
of such little importance

896
01:20:35,714 --> 01:20:38,466
as to merit no further
scientific attention."

897
01:20:38,592 --> 01:20:41,636
Is that all?
Thank you for your help.

898
01:20:42,095 --> 01:20:44,889
I'll send along a copy
as soon as it's ready.

899
01:20:47,976 --> 01:20:51,187
Are you coming?
I'd like your signature on my report.

900
01:20:51,313 --> 01:20:54,065
- I'll stop by tomorrow.
- Good day, then.

901
01:21:01,531 --> 01:21:04,533
Well, what's to become
of old Granny now?

902
01:21:04,785 --> 01:21:08,412
Fat little pigs
shouldn't grunt too loud.

903
01:21:08,705 --> 01:21:10,956
They could become bacon.

904
01:21:11,208 --> 01:21:14,377
I don't bear grudges,
but I do have a good memory,

905
01:21:14,544 --> 01:21:16,629
especially for faces.

906
01:21:16,755 --> 01:21:20,549
"That was the first time the fly farted
without losing its rump" --

907
01:21:20,717 --> 01:21:23,219
so my mother used to say.

908
01:21:25,263 --> 01:21:26,889
Careful.

909
01:21:27,015 --> 01:21:31,018
There are homes and institutions
for riff-raff like you.

910
01:21:31,144 --> 01:21:34,230
You understand what I mean?
- Oh, yes.

911
01:21:34,856 --> 01:21:37,274
My regards to your wife,
by the way.

912
01:22:22,529 --> 01:22:24,613
Would you do me a favor?

913
01:22:28,452 --> 01:22:30,578
Please stop the clock.

914
01:22:52,309 --> 01:22:54,018
Hear how quiet it is?

915
01:22:54,644 --> 01:22:56,145
Yes...

916
01:22:56,688 --> 01:22:58,481
it's very quiet.

917
01:22:59,983 --> 01:23:01,817
Why did you let it happen?

918
01:23:03,153 --> 01:23:04,320
Me?

919
01:23:06,072 --> 01:23:07,740
You wanted revenge.

920
01:23:07,866 --> 01:23:09,617
I don't know
what you're talking about.

921
01:23:09,743 --> 01:23:12,495
Vergèrus surprised me.
I had no say in the matter.

922
01:23:14,122 --> 01:23:16,207
You wanted revenge.

923
01:23:17,042 --> 01:23:19,001
A strange sort of revenge!

924
01:23:19,419 --> 01:23:20,836
Yes...

925
01:23:21,963 --> 01:23:23,839
very strange.

926
01:23:24,090 --> 01:23:25,841
Revenge!

927
01:23:32,390 --> 01:23:35,017
I can't bear it any longer.

928
01:23:38,355 --> 01:23:40,397
Manda?

929
01:23:41,608 --> 01:23:43,609
Don't turn around.

930
01:23:44,361 --> 01:23:47,321
Go and lock the attic door.

931
01:23:47,447 --> 01:23:50,741
Don't ask questions.
Do as I say.

932
01:26:17,347 --> 01:26:19,348
It's hot up here.

933
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:23,185
A momentary nausea.

934
01:27:09,607 --> 01:27:11,608
A tool of some kind...

935
01:28:33,316 --> 01:28:37,027
Either this is a dream
or I'm losing my mind.

936
01:28:37,654 --> 01:28:40,531
Since it's inconceivable
that I've lost all reason,

937
01:28:40,657 --> 01:28:42,783
I'll just wait till I wake up.

938
01:29:13,857 --> 01:29:15,357
Very interesting indeed.

939
01:31:56,728 --> 01:31:58,729
Leave him alone.

940
01:32:13,703 --> 01:32:16,204
You induced
a momentary fear of death.

941
01:32:16,914 --> 01:32:18,582
Nothing more.

942
01:32:19,876 --> 01:32:22,878
Nothing else.
- Leave him alone, I say.

943
01:33:09,425 --> 01:33:12,344
May I have a little money?
We don't have a shilling.

944
01:33:12,470 --> 01:33:14,846
We're broke.

945
01:33:14,972 --> 01:33:17,599
At least a few coins
for our performance.

946
01:33:20,144 --> 01:33:22,604
You stare like
you've never seen me before,

947
01:33:22,772 --> 01:33:24,773
yet we were soul mates.

948
01:33:24,899 --> 01:33:26,900
I've never seen you before.

949
01:33:27,944 --> 01:33:29,611
I don't know you.

950
01:33:29,779 --> 01:33:32,823
I was in disguise.
Does that make any difference?

951
01:33:32,949 --> 01:33:35,951
Ask your husband.
We don't need a lot.

952
01:33:36,119 --> 01:33:37,828
Don't touch me!

953
01:33:41,874 --> 01:33:43,417
Mr. Vergèrus!

954
01:33:44,961 --> 01:33:46,461
Will you help me?

955
01:33:46,629 --> 01:33:49,047
Convince the police chief
to let us leave.

956
01:33:49,173 --> 01:33:51,466
I promise we won't come back.

957
01:33:51,592 --> 01:33:54,094
I'd like to know
just whom I dissected.

958
01:33:54,220 --> 01:33:58,473
A poor actor whose greatest wish
was to be cut open and scraped clean.

959
01:33:58,641 --> 01:34:02,769
So you were never dead --
perhaps not even unconscious.

960
01:34:02,895 --> 01:34:04,729
Yes, it was a cheap trick.

961
01:34:04,856 --> 01:34:07,441
- Are you even sure you're Vogler?
- I think so.

962
01:34:07,567 --> 01:34:10,068
Not some actor
or someone else?

963
01:34:10,194 --> 01:34:13,113
Mock me if you like,
but help me.

964
01:34:13,656 --> 01:34:16,074
You said
you'd taken a liking to us.

965
01:34:16,659 --> 01:34:19,870
I liked his face more
than I like yours.

966
01:34:21,080 --> 01:34:24,416
Put on your disguise again
so I recognize you.

967
01:34:24,542 --> 01:34:27,294
Then perhaps
we can discuss your situation.

968
01:34:28,629 --> 01:34:30,630
You are ungrateful, sir!

969
01:34:33,134 --> 01:34:35,677
Didn't I do
everything in my power

970
01:34:35,803 --> 01:34:37,846
to allow you to feel
something?

971
01:34:38,014 --> 01:34:41,725
It was a miserable performance,
but of course you should be paid.

972
01:34:50,985 --> 01:34:53,028
Take a good look at that man,

973
01:34:53,196 --> 01:34:55,322
then tell me if I won our bet.

974
01:34:56,282 --> 01:34:57,824
You're right.

975
01:34:58,367 --> 01:34:59,868
I lost.

976
01:35:04,040 --> 01:35:07,209
Simson, go hitch up the horses.
We're leaving.

977
01:35:08,586 --> 01:35:10,712
Would you help us pack,
Mr. Tubal?

978
01:35:11,214 --> 01:35:12,714
I'm staying here.

979
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:14,841
My path leads elsewhere.

980
01:35:14,967 --> 01:35:18,428
One should live for the hereafter,
as Sofia says.

981
01:35:18,554 --> 01:35:20,764
A higher goal, you understand.

982
01:35:20,890 --> 01:35:23,975
More meaning
and fewer apparatus.

983
01:35:46,749 --> 01:35:49,292
No, I'm not going with you.

984
01:35:50,461 --> 01:35:52,629
You're looking at my pouches

985
01:35:53,089 --> 01:35:56,800
and wondering, aren't you?
Go ahead and look.

986
01:35:56,926 --> 01:35:59,844
There are 6,000 riksdaler here

987
01:35:59,971 --> 01:36:03,056
that Granny collected
over the years

988
01:36:03,182 --> 01:36:05,642
and buried here and there.

989
01:36:06,769 --> 01:36:09,271
Granny's potions.

990
01:36:09,981 --> 01:36:12,983
People will pay anything for love.

991
01:36:14,277 --> 01:36:16,403
Didn't know that, did you?

992
01:36:17,655 --> 01:36:19,906
Good-bye, Albert. I'm off.

993
01:36:20,032 --> 01:36:23,159
I've always said you were
a foolish and reckless man.

994
01:36:23,786 --> 01:36:27,122
One should know one's limitations.

995
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:30,750
Help me down.

996
01:36:35,214 --> 01:36:37,799
There goes the rabble.
I won't miss them.

997
01:36:37,967 --> 01:36:40,969
- Nor will I.
- Me neither.

998
01:36:41,637 --> 01:36:43,805
- Come along, Tubal.
- What?

999
01:36:44,390 --> 01:36:46,975
Again, Sofia? But --

1000
01:36:50,646 --> 01:36:53,356
I'm coming, Sofia.

1001
01:37:13,294 --> 01:37:15,170
May I please go with you?

1002
01:37:15,338 --> 01:37:18,089
I don't know what's gotten into me.
I must be crazy.

1003
01:37:18,215 --> 01:37:20,091
It must be that love potion.

1004
01:37:20,217 --> 01:37:22,761
I can't think the way
I told myself to.

1005
01:37:22,887 --> 01:37:26,014
Go get your things.
Hurry now!

1006
01:37:26,349 --> 01:37:28,183
Thank you so much!

1007
01:37:28,684 --> 01:37:31,895
Simson, I'm coming with you!
- I'll help you!

1008
01:37:59,340 --> 01:38:01,383
What's taking them so long?

1009
01:38:01,967 --> 01:38:03,802
We have to get away.

1010
01:38:04,470 --> 01:38:06,805
lf we can just get out of town.

1011
01:38:12,728 --> 01:38:14,396
Too late...

1012
01:38:15,106 --> 01:38:16,731
too late.

1013
01:39:06,699 --> 01:39:08,867
You were lucky, Tubal.

1014
01:39:15,124 --> 01:39:17,333
Who are you, sir?

1015
01:39:17,460 --> 01:39:20,128
This is the mesmerizer
Albert Emanuel Vogler,

1016
01:39:20,254 --> 01:39:22,714
whom we thought
we autopsied a few hours ago.

1017
01:39:22,840 --> 01:39:25,717
Mr. Vogler deceived us
in his own special way.

1018
01:39:25,843 --> 01:39:28,803
I can't be sure,
but it's probably Mr. Vogler

1019
01:39:28,929 --> 01:39:31,431
who stands there,
wrapped in a blanket.

1020
01:39:31,557 --> 01:39:33,933
Congratulations.

1021
01:39:35,644 --> 01:39:39,272
"I have the pleasure
to inform you as follows:

1022
01:39:39,398 --> 01:39:41,357
His Majesty the King

1023
01:39:41,567 --> 01:39:44,569
has expressed
his desire to witness

1024
01:39:44,695 --> 01:39:47,822
one of Vogler's
magnetic performances.

1025
01:39:48,282 --> 01:39:52,577
I am hereby ordered to conduct
the said Vogler to the royal palace

1026
01:39:52,703 --> 01:39:56,998
so that arrangements may be made
for the evening's entertainment.

1027
01:39:58,584 --> 01:40:00,835
lssued at the Royal Palace,

1028
01:40:01,003 --> 01:40:04,214
July 14, 1846.
Marshal of the Royal Court."

1029
01:40:06,717 --> 01:40:09,719
I trust you won't mention
a word of what's transpired.

1030
01:40:12,014 --> 01:40:13,848
For your own sake.

1031
01:40:16,685 --> 01:40:19,229
It's high time you be off,
Dr. Vogler.

1032
01:40:20,314 --> 01:40:23,733
Gather my apparatus
and send them to the palace.

1033
01:40:24,360 --> 01:40:27,695
But be careful.
They're very valuable.

1034
01:40:49,718 --> 01:40:51,261
My darling Simson!

1035
01:40:51,387 --> 01:40:53,888
Not now, for God's sake!
Tonight!
