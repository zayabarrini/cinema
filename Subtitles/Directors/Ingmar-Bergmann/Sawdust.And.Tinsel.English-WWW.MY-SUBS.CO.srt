1
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:37,751
SAWDUST AND TINSEL

2
00:00:39,364 --> 00:00:45,496
A BROADSIDE BALLAD ON FILM
FROM INGMAR BERGMAN

3
00:06:02,454 --> 00:06:06,083
I will see my wife and kids tomorrow.
Strange, huh?

4
00:06:06,258 --> 00:06:08,749
Yes, it's been three years.

5
00:06:10,028 --> 00:06:14,362
Did you hear the story about Frost
the clown and his wife, Alma?

6
00:06:14,533 --> 00:06:16,728
We were with Weger back then.

7
00:06:16,902 --> 00:06:18,961
<i>Was that in the next town?</i>

8
00:06:19,137 --> 00:06:22,265
Yes. I was there.
It was a hell of a business.

9
00:06:24,543 --> 00:06:27,137
Tell the story if you want.

10
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:30,311
Poor old Frost.

11
00:06:32,617 --> 00:06:37,680
It was a hot summer's day...
let's see, seven years ago.

12
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:41,383
The regiment had
shooting practice by the shore.

13
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,223
The officers lay on the grass,
hot and sweaty,

14
00:06:45,397 --> 00:06:49,163
drinking out of boredom.

15
00:06:49,334 --> 00:06:55,569
The soldiers slogged away in the quarry
and cursed the awful heat.

16
00:06:55,941 --> 00:06:59,809
Then along came Alma,
an imposing woman.

17
00:06:59,978 --> 00:07:05,883
Carried herself like a queen,
if a bit past her prime.

18
00:08:56,761 --> 00:08:59,525
Yes, I heard that.

19
00:08:59,698 --> 00:09:03,964
I once had the opportunity

20
00:09:04,135 --> 00:09:08,435
to perform for His Majesty...

21
00:09:08,606 --> 00:09:10,699
The captain sends his greetings.

22
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:14,675
The captain has the honor
of presenting me with... what?

23
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:16,575
Your wife Alma...

24
00:09:16,748 --> 00:09:19,945
My wife Alma... go on.

25
00:09:20,118 --> 00:09:23,144
...is swimming naked
with the regiment!

26
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:29,282
- Show you're a man!
- We'll help you give her hell!

27
00:09:29,461 --> 00:09:33,295
We'll help you tan
that saucy hide of hers!

28
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:37,433
You come with me!

29
00:13:07,979 --> 00:13:10,948
Man the cannons!

30
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:57,746
Alma began to shriek
that we'd done her old man in.

31
00:14:57,922 --> 00:15:02,291
We got angry
and told her it was her own fault.

32
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:06,021
But we picked him up
and carried him back anyway.

33
00:15:48,806 --> 00:15:51,570
That's a woman
and love for you.

34
00:18:12,617 --> 00:18:15,643
What are you doing, Guldström?

35
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,913
Are you crazy?

36
00:18:21,592 --> 00:18:22,991
Come here!

37
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,459
In this rain!

38
00:19:30,174 --> 00:19:35,976
None of us has been paid,
and we have nothing to eat.

39
00:19:36,146 --> 00:19:39,707
We had to leave
half the costumes behind.

40
00:19:39,883 --> 00:19:43,375
Many of us have
nothing to perform in.

41
00:19:44,788 --> 00:19:47,780
We understand it's hard for you.

42
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:51,052
You can't do anything
about the weather.

43
00:19:51,829 --> 00:19:55,765
The Ekbergs and Asta
and all the kids have worms,

44
00:19:55,933 --> 00:20:00,597
and all the wagons
are full of fleas.

45
00:20:00,771 --> 00:20:03,604
I could start my own menagerie.

46
00:20:05,142 --> 00:20:07,940
They say bear meat
is a delicacy.

47
00:20:08,112 --> 00:20:12,048
Let's kill the bear
before it starves to death.

48
00:20:12,216 --> 00:20:13,911
Shut up!

49
00:20:14,084 --> 00:20:16,279
We'd kill you
before we'd do that!

50
00:20:16,453 --> 00:20:19,320
I'd rather kill myself!

51
00:20:19,723 --> 00:20:22,886
What do you say, Albert?

52
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,290
You haven't said a word.

53
00:20:26,196 --> 00:20:28,824
You try to do your best,

54
00:20:28,999 --> 00:20:32,025
but you still end up
feeling like a fool.

55
00:20:32,336 --> 00:20:35,897
But in America...
- This isn't America. This is Skane!

56
00:20:36,073 --> 00:20:39,839
In America, circus folk
ride through town,

57
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:42,706
while bands play
and the elephants trumpet.

58
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,542
Everyone puts on
their biggest smile,

59
00:20:45,716 --> 00:20:49,379
and people line the streets
and cheer.

60
00:20:49,553 --> 00:20:52,989
A booming voice announces
the show for that evening.

61
00:20:54,091 --> 00:20:57,151
Why don't we take
the wagons and horses

62
00:20:57,327 --> 00:20:59,352
and put on
our best costumes...

63
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:02,966
- The ones we left behind?
- No, the ones we kept.

64
00:21:03,133 --> 00:21:08,298
We'll make posters, Ekberg will play,
and Anton will announce the program.

65
00:21:08,472 --> 00:21:10,702
Not a bad idea!

66
00:21:10,874 --> 00:21:13,843
I'll wear my green costume
with the feathers.

67
00:21:14,011 --> 00:21:16,241
I won't perform with the dwarf!

68
00:21:16,413 --> 00:21:19,814
<i>I'll shout,
"Here comes the Alberti Circus!"</i>

69
00:21:22,252 --> 00:21:24,846
Listen, I have another idea.

70
00:21:25,022 --> 00:21:27,286
Sjuberg's theater troupe
is in town.

71
00:21:27,457 --> 00:21:33,054
I'll ask them to lend us costumes
for a grand gala tonight!

72
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:37,599
Then we'll throw a big dinner
for them after the show,

73
00:21:37,768 --> 00:21:40,362
with four kinds of liquor,

74
00:21:40,537 --> 00:21:45,099
chateaubriand and caviar!

75
00:21:48,879 --> 00:21:53,248
<i>On the blossom-covered hill
Hjalmar sings</i>

76
00:21:53,417 --> 00:21:57,410
<i>Of battles of long ago</i>

77
00:21:59,523 --> 00:22:02,651
Look! It's clearing up!

78
00:22:03,393 --> 00:22:05,691
Put on your nice yellow dress,

79
00:22:05,862 --> 00:22:08,330
curl your hair
and put on your best makeup.

80
00:22:08,498 --> 00:22:10,830
We're paying a visit.
- On the governor?

81
00:22:11,001 --> 00:22:14,994
- Sjuberg, my girl.
- The theater director? You're mad.

82
00:22:15,439 --> 00:22:18,067
Look what I found!

83
00:22:22,946 --> 00:22:26,040
Wash behind your ears, you pig.

84
00:22:26,283 --> 00:22:29,275
You won't leave me, will you?

85
00:22:30,287 --> 00:22:33,381
- What do you mean?
- If the circus goes bust.

86
00:22:33,557 --> 00:22:34,990
Oh, you!

87
00:22:37,961 --> 00:22:39,895
We'll come up with a plan.

88
00:22:40,063 --> 00:22:42,930
You'll never leave me, will you?
You promised!

89
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,227
Take it easy, child.

90
00:22:45,502 --> 00:22:47,333
You're going to see your wife.

91
00:22:47,504 --> 00:22:50,337
And my boys.
It's been three years.

92
00:22:50,507 --> 00:22:54,443
I'm scared.
You won't go back to them, will you?

93
00:22:54,945 --> 00:22:57,436
Don't worry, little girl.

94
00:23:05,355 --> 00:23:07,220
May I shave now?

95
00:23:10,761 --> 00:23:13,992
Anyway, our luck has to change.
- You think so?

96
00:23:14,164 --> 00:23:17,497
Of course. Some circus owners
are colossally rich,

97
00:23:17,668 --> 00:23:20,296
with houses, diamonds,

98
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:23,667
and automobiles,
or whatever they're called.

99
00:23:24,975 --> 00:23:26,909
Of course...

100
00:23:27,377 --> 00:23:29,504
that's in America.

101
00:24:05,082 --> 00:24:07,915
Of course that costume
wasn't left behind!

102
00:24:08,085 --> 00:24:10,610
Or the parasol either!
You can bet on that!

103
00:25:05,008 --> 00:25:08,375
- What's wrong?
- Wrong? Nothing.

104
00:25:08,545 --> 00:25:10,240
You seem nervous.

105
00:25:10,414 --> 00:25:12,814
Me? Not at all.

106
00:25:12,983 --> 00:25:14,974
Remember: I'll do the talking.

107
00:25:15,152 --> 00:25:18,246
You sit there quietly
with your most charming smile.

108
00:25:18,422 --> 00:25:21,220
Sjuberg's very fond
of pretty girls.

109
00:25:21,391 --> 00:25:25,293
Breathe deeply
to show off your bosom,

110
00:25:25,462 --> 00:25:28,522
and show him your legs
if he asks.

111
00:25:28,698 --> 00:25:33,260
Don't worry... I'll be there.
If he gets fresh, I'll slug him.

112
00:25:33,437 --> 00:25:34,961
Shall we?

113
00:25:36,706 --> 00:25:39,072
<i>NOW PLAYING:
"BETRAYAL"</i>

114
00:25:40,043 --> 00:25:44,503
<i>A pure heart is a woman's
most treasured possession.</i>

00:25:44,681 --> 00:25:48,208
<i>It will withstand

116

<i>Rest assured, Father,</i>

117
00:25:51,455 --> 00:25:54,982
<i>that your words of warning
will bear fruit in my heart.</i>

<i>Dear lady, your mother

00:25:59,062 --> 00:26:00,893
My lord!

120
00:26:01,064 --> 00:26:02,827
Madam...

121
00:26:03,433 --> 00:26:06,493
leave us alone for a while.

122
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:08,533
Mr. Galender!

123
00:26:08,705 --> 00:26:10,070
Yes, sir?

124
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,471
Start over from page 36.

125
00:26:14,578 --> 00:26:16,808
- Who are you here to see?
- The director.

126
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:19,972
- He's in rehearsal!
- May we wait?

127
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:22,516
No, he's very busy.

128
00:26:23,487 --> 00:26:26,945
Who the devil
is Blom blabbering with?

129
00:26:27,724 --> 00:26:30,750
A lady and gentlemen to see you, sir.
I told them...

130
00:26:30,927 --> 00:26:33,725
Tell them to go to hell!

131
00:26:34,064 --> 00:26:37,295
No, wait. Bring them here.

132
00:26:38,034 --> 00:26:40,628
Stop, damn it!
The director will see you.

133
00:26:40,804 --> 00:26:45,241
It's not important.
We'll come back another day...

134
00:26:57,587 --> 00:27:00,055
Good morning, Mr. Sjuberg.

135
00:27:00,657 --> 00:27:02,887
Lovely weather today.

136
00:27:05,328 --> 00:27:08,161
I am Albert Johansson.

137
00:27:08,331 --> 00:27:12,859
I own the Alberti Circus,
which just arrived in town today.

138
00:27:13,036 --> 00:27:16,233
And this is my wife, Anne.

139
00:27:16,406 --> 00:27:18,806
Curtsy to the director.

140
00:27:22,546 --> 00:27:24,946
How may I be of assistance?

141
00:27:25,115 --> 00:27:27,583
We, uh...

142
00:27:27,851 --> 00:27:30,376
A chair for the lady, Mr. Blom.

143
00:27:30,554 --> 00:27:32,522
Allow me, your ladyship.

144
00:27:32,856 --> 00:27:34,380
Please.

145
00:27:36,593 --> 00:27:39,061
Go on, Mr. Alberti.

146
00:27:39,229 --> 00:27:42,198
Well, the thing is that

147
00:27:42,365 --> 00:27:44,731
due to an unfortunate mishap,

148
00:27:44,901 --> 00:27:47,631
half our costumes
were ruined in Askared.

149
00:27:47,804 --> 00:27:52,104
I thought perhaps Mr. Sjuberg
might come to our rescue

150
00:27:52,275 --> 00:27:57,178
and lend us some capes,
trousers, and hats.

151
00:27:57,347 --> 00:27:58,974
Between colleagues.

152
00:27:59,149 --> 00:28:01,879
What if our costumes get infested?

153
00:28:03,086 --> 00:28:06,385
Scabies, lice,
strange diseases.

154
00:28:06,556 --> 00:28:11,255
I've never dealt with a circus before.
Dreadful things could happen.

155
00:28:11,428 --> 00:28:13,658
Mr. Sjuberg, I assure you...

156
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:16,230
How much can you pay?

157
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:19,493
Well, that is, I thought...

158
00:28:20,136 --> 00:28:23,003
We were counting on...

159
00:28:23,173 --> 00:28:26,142
How much do you want?
- More than you can pay.

160
00:28:26,309 --> 00:28:28,300
Why do you insult me?

161
00:28:28,478 --> 00:28:29,843
Why?

162
00:28:30,013 --> 00:28:33,710
Because we belong to the same riffraff,
the same wretched pack,

163
00:28:33,883 --> 00:28:36,283
and because you put up
with my insults.

164
00:28:36,453 --> 00:28:38,683
No, don't hit me.

165
00:28:38,855 --> 00:28:42,621
You live in caravans.
We stay in filthy hotels.

166
00:28:42,792 --> 00:28:45,625
We make art.
You make artifice.

167
00:28:45,795 --> 00:28:50,289
The lowest of us would spit
on the best of you. Why?

168
00:28:50,467 --> 00:28:54,198
You only risk your lives.
We risk our pride.

169
00:28:54,371 --> 00:28:57,898
I think you look
ridiculous and overdressed,

170
00:28:58,074 --> 00:29:02,909
and your little lady
would look better without her finery.

171
00:29:03,747 --> 00:29:06,614
If you dared,
you'd think us even sillier,

172
00:29:06,783 --> 00:29:11,743
with our shabby elegance,
our painted faces, our pretentious speech.

173
00:29:12,622 --> 00:29:15,284
So why shouldn't I insult you?

174
00:29:15,458 --> 00:29:17,289
I don't understand.

175
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,087
That's why you win.

176
00:29:19,262 --> 00:29:20,889
What about the costumes?

177
00:29:21,064 --> 00:29:23,589
You may borrow them.
Take what you need.

178
00:29:23,767 --> 00:29:25,667
What about payment?

179
00:29:25,835 --> 00:29:28,702
Invite us to the circus tonight.

180
00:29:28,872 --> 00:29:31,432
- It will be an honor.
- Quite so.

181
00:29:31,608 --> 00:29:34,406
Blom will show you to the costumes.

182
00:29:34,577 --> 00:29:36,169
Good-bye.

183
00:29:40,583 --> 00:29:44,041
Carry on with rehearsal.
Same scene.

184
00:30:36,506 --> 00:30:38,599
<i>You've driven me half mad,</i>

185
00:30:39,342 --> 00:30:41,367
<i>out of my senses.</i>

186
00:30:41,811 --> 00:30:43,802
<i>Will you marry me?</i>

187
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:46,642
<i>You can't go off
with that old ass!</i>

188
00:30:47,917 --> 00:30:50,408
<i>Do you share his bed?</i>

189
00:30:50,954 --> 00:30:54,890
<i>Do you whisper
sweet nothings in his ear?</i>

190
00:30:55,792 --> 00:30:57,692
Come with me. You must.

191
00:30:57,861 --> 00:31:01,558
Torture me no more.
I love you.

192
00:31:02,332 --> 00:31:04,698
I want you now.

193
00:31:04,868 --> 00:31:08,599
Come, before I take you by force

194
00:31:08,772 --> 00:31:11,673
right in front of your
ridiculous circus director!

195
00:31:11,841 --> 00:31:13,001
Let me go!

196
00:31:13,176 --> 00:31:17,169
Let them do what they want...
I won't let you go.

197
00:31:18,982 --> 00:31:22,110
You can't treat me like this
or speak of my husband that way.

198
00:31:22,285 --> 00:31:24,253
Don't touch me, you...

199
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,479
If we were alone,

200
00:31:26,656 --> 00:31:28,783
I'd strike you down.

201
00:31:28,958 --> 00:31:34,362
I'd crush your resistance
like a piece of dirty paper.

202
00:31:37,467 --> 00:31:39,833
What play is that from?

203
00:31:40,003 --> 00:31:44,337
Don't be ridiculous, snorting like a bull!
I'm not your cow!

204
00:31:44,507 --> 00:31:47,601
Save it for your pale,
flat-chested actresses

205
00:31:47,777 --> 00:31:50,746
who swoon
if you look in their direction!

206
00:31:51,948 --> 00:31:54,280
What is your ladyship's price?

207
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:57,942
Tactless of me
not to mention that.

208
00:31:58,121 --> 00:32:00,817
We should have
discussed price first.

209
00:32:01,791 --> 00:32:06,660
You're too pretty, you poor thing.
You might just as well be a girl.

210
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,168
Know what I think?

211
00:32:12,335 --> 00:32:15,099
You've never
satisfied a woman.

212
00:32:15,271 --> 00:32:19,002
Be careful what you say,
you little ass.

213
00:32:19,175 --> 00:32:22,110
You're not so pretty
with red ears.

214
00:32:22,278 --> 00:32:25,179
Touch me and I'll bite
that mouth to shreds.

215
00:32:26,015 --> 00:32:29,746
I'll make mincemeat of it.

216
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:37,387
No, I'm not pretty,
but you are.

217
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:40,461
Forgive what I said,
I beg of you.

218
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:43,292
You must forgive me.
You must love me.

219
00:32:43,466 --> 00:32:45,331
You must!

220
00:32:45,501 --> 00:32:47,264
I beg you!

221
00:32:49,205 --> 00:32:51,105
On your knees then.

222
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:56,601
Bang your head on the floor.

223
00:32:57,413 --> 00:33:00,576
Do as I say.
Again! Harder!

224
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:12,421
I shall kiss you once...

225
00:33:12,595 --> 00:33:14,893
and only once.

226
00:33:22,472 --> 00:33:24,099
Go away.

227
00:33:24,807 --> 00:33:27,674
Go! You've hurt me too badly!

228
00:33:41,257 --> 00:33:43,384
What costumes!
What a parade!

229
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:48,394
The Alberti Circus
will throw a grand gala tonight!

230
00:33:49,699 --> 00:33:52,259
My little Anne,
Blom's our friend!

231
00:33:52,435 --> 00:33:54,665
He shared his schnapps with me!

232
00:33:55,538 --> 00:33:57,028
Care for some?

233
00:34:23,666 --> 00:34:27,568
Ladies and gentlemen,
listen and marvel!

234
00:34:27,737 --> 00:34:31,798
At great expense and sacrifice,

235
00:34:31,975 --> 00:34:34,910
the Alberti Circus
has come to visit your town

236
00:34:35,078 --> 00:34:38,411
and dazzle you tonight

237
00:34:38,581 --> 00:34:42,950
with a gala performance
the likes of which you've never seen!

238
00:34:45,221 --> 00:34:47,985
Beauty and thrills,

239
00:34:48,157 --> 00:34:51,752
to say nothing of laughter!

240
00:34:57,266 --> 00:34:59,325
The greatest laughs of your life!

241
00:34:59,502 --> 00:35:01,970
Magnificent costumes and sets,

242
00:35:02,138 --> 00:35:09,635
and artists who've gained renown
in the major capitals of the world!

243
00:35:10,346 --> 00:35:11,779
<i>Silence!</i>

244
00:35:12,382 --> 00:35:15,283
Silence! You hear me?

245
00:35:16,152 --> 00:35:19,713
What are these shenanigans?
Don't you know this is illegal?

246
00:35:19,889 --> 00:35:24,292
- We're just promoting our...
- Did you obtain a permit, sir?

247
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:27,759
- A permit? We thought...
- You thought!

248
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:32,094
Climb down from there
and get to the fairground.

249
00:35:32,268 --> 00:35:34,202
You can practice
your damned "art" there.

250
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:38,466
- But...
- Shut up, you impudent circus ape!

251
00:35:38,641 --> 00:35:43,476
Must I pound His Majesty's laws
into that thick skull of yours?

252
00:35:43,646 --> 00:35:47,241
Now get down and clear out.
Let's get them!

253
00:35:48,317 --> 00:35:50,285
Cop, cop, stupid fop!

254
00:36:05,768 --> 00:36:07,895
Unhitch the horses!

255
00:36:10,907 --> 00:36:13,740
We're keeping
your horses until tomorrow.

256
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:16,970
That'll teach you to be impudent!

257
00:36:17,313 --> 00:36:18,610
Go on now!

258
00:36:19,782 --> 00:36:21,215
You too!

259
00:36:25,521 --> 00:36:27,182
Damned carnies!

260
00:36:27,356 --> 00:36:31,156
Go on!
Take the horses away!

261
00:36:54,984 --> 00:36:58,681
<i>You can't play here
when we're playing!</i>

262
00:36:59,522 --> 00:37:02,980
Sit down or we'll shoot you!

263
00:37:03,926 --> 00:37:06,258
No, I didn't mean it like that.

264
00:37:08,297 --> 00:37:11,755
I want to get cleaned up!

265
00:37:36,025 --> 00:37:40,189
- You don't usually clean my boots.
- So she can't say they're dirty.

266
00:37:40,363 --> 00:37:44,265
Oh, to hell with them!
Let her say what she likes!

267
00:37:45,434 --> 00:37:47,527
You shouldn't drink
in the morning.

268
00:37:47,703 --> 00:37:49,967
- When will you be back?
- That's my business.

269
00:37:50,139 --> 00:37:52,607
Or do you plan to stay
the night? How nice!

270
00:37:52,775 --> 00:37:55,573
Can't I visit my boys?
It's been three years.

271
00:37:55,745 --> 00:37:59,545
- Then why all the fuss now?
- You wouldn't understand.

272
00:37:59,715 --> 00:38:02,946
I understand she's waiting
for you to come back

273
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:07,522
and pretend to help in her shop.
That would suit you fine!

274
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:09,590
Shut your trap.

275
00:38:10,259 --> 00:38:14,889
You don't deny it.
You want to put all this behind you.

276
00:38:15,064 --> 00:38:19,592
You old buzzard! You're getting old
and rickety... and scared!

277
00:38:20,603 --> 00:38:23,128
I'll be back for the show.

278
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,198
- Don't go.
- Why?

279
00:38:26,375 --> 00:38:29,902
Don't go, I beg you!

280
00:38:43,459 --> 00:38:45,552
- You're crying.
- I am not.

281
00:38:45,728 --> 00:38:48,561
- Are you jealous?
- Is that so strange?

282
00:38:48,731 --> 00:38:51,029
You're leaving
and might not come back.

283
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,692
You're sick of the circus
and me and everything.

284
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:58,101
What would I do without you?

285
00:38:59,075 --> 00:39:00,702
I love you.

286
00:39:01,444 --> 00:39:03,309
You don't love me,

287
00:39:03,479 --> 00:39:06,505
or you wouldn't
go see your wife.

288
00:39:06,849 --> 00:39:08,476
I really do love you.

289
00:39:08,651 --> 00:39:09,948
No, you don't.

290
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:13,020
All right, damn it, I don't!

291
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:18,626
I won't be here when you get back.
You hear me?

292
00:39:18,794 --> 00:39:20,455
Where will you go?

293
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:22,791
I just won't be here.

294
00:39:25,835 --> 00:39:27,700
Suit yourself.

295
00:39:45,388 --> 00:39:47,754
I won't be here!

296
00:40:09,111 --> 00:40:12,080
<i>- Can I help you?
- Good day.</i>

297
00:40:12,615 --> 00:40:14,344
I'd like...

298
00:40:15,551 --> 00:40:18,247
<i>Don't you recognize me?
- No.</i>

299
00:40:18,421 --> 00:40:19,718
I see.

300
00:40:19,889 --> 00:40:21,754
<i>Can I help you?</i>

301
00:40:21,924 --> 00:40:24,415
<i>- Is your mother here?
- Yes.</i>

302
00:40:24,593 --> 00:40:27,926
<i>- May I speak with her?
- She's fixing lunch.</i>

303
00:40:30,266 --> 00:40:33,326
Perhaps I could
sit down and wait.

304
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:47,613
Nice weather we're having.

305
00:40:47,783 --> 00:40:49,273
Are you my father?

306
00:40:50,886 --> 00:40:52,410
Yes.

307
00:40:56,225 --> 00:40:58,659
- How have you been?
- Fine, thanks.

308
00:40:58,828 --> 00:41:02,320
- And Albert?
- He lost a tooth yesterday.

309
00:41:02,531 --> 00:41:06,365
You help your mother in the shop?
That's a good boy.

310
00:41:06,535 --> 00:41:09,902
I mean... good boy.

311
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:13,104
How old are you?
- Nine.

312
00:41:13,275 --> 00:41:17,109
A big boy! Would you like
to come join the circus?

313
00:41:17,279 --> 00:41:18,678
No!

314
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:21,078
Here comes Mother.

315
00:41:26,956 --> 00:41:28,423
Hello, Agda.

316
00:41:29,191 --> 00:41:33,025
I was in town
and thought I'd drop in.

317
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:37,331
- Would you like lunch?
- Do I look that hungry?

318
00:41:37,666 --> 00:41:39,293
I didn't mean that.

319
00:41:40,369 --> 00:41:41,563
Yes, thanks.

320
00:41:43,072 --> 00:41:44,369
Come in, then.

321
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:50,274
Look after the shop.

322
00:42:02,992 --> 00:42:06,291
All I can offer is pancakes.
Will they do?

323
00:42:06,462 --> 00:42:08,191
They'll do just fine.

324
00:42:16,872 --> 00:42:18,863
Things are going well for you.

325
00:42:19,041 --> 00:42:23,000
Yes, I took over
the other tobacco shop.

326
00:42:23,446 --> 00:42:26,176
We're the only ones in town
selling tobacco now.

327
00:42:26,348 --> 00:42:28,009
It pays well.

328
00:42:28,184 --> 00:42:30,152
You kept the old shop?

329
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:32,617
What do you think?

330
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:38,385
Take off your coat, if you like.
- I'm all right.

331
00:42:39,061 --> 00:42:42,087
Take off your coat.
I'll sew on your button.

332
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:51,501
What have you done
with your shirts?

333
00:42:51,674 --> 00:42:53,642
Mind your own business!

334
00:42:54,243 --> 00:42:57,610
- You might buy one.
- I have no money!

335
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:00,214
- Don't shout at me.
- You always...

336
00:43:00,382 --> 00:43:03,180
If you're going to quarrel,
leave right now.

337
00:43:06,188 --> 00:43:08,850
If you like,
you can borrow from me.

338
00:43:09,024 --> 00:43:11,925
- Keep your damn money!
- What kind of talk is that?

339
00:43:12,094 --> 00:43:15,461
<i>"What kind of talk is that?"
Keep your nose out of my affairs.</i>

340
00:43:15,631 --> 00:43:18,600
I don't need your generosity.

341
00:43:18,767 --> 00:43:23,067
You're always so touchy.
Why can't you act normal for once?

342
00:43:23,239 --> 00:43:26,003
Why shouldn't you
borrow from me?

343
00:43:26,175 --> 00:43:29,303
You've got the upper hand now
and want to get even.

344
00:43:29,478 --> 00:43:33,505
- Why should I?
- Stop it. You're a terrible actress.

345
00:43:34,683 --> 00:43:37,174
You mean
because you left me?

346
00:43:37,586 --> 00:43:40,384
Don't you realize
how grateful I am?

347
00:43:41,357 --> 00:43:44,087
That's right... grateful.

348
00:43:44,727 --> 00:43:48,595
When you left me,
I finally found peace.

349
00:43:48,764 --> 00:43:51,130
My life was my own again.

350
00:43:51,534 --> 00:43:56,164
No more of that dreadful circus
that I always loathed and feared.

351
00:43:56,338 --> 00:43:59,000
All those people
shouting and swearing,

352
00:43:59,174 --> 00:44:04,874
always being on the road,
that world of misery, lice, disease.

353
00:44:05,314 --> 00:44:09,011
No, my dear,
I'm happy now.

354
00:44:09,184 --> 00:44:11,015
And grateful.

355
00:44:12,922 --> 00:44:15,152
Shall we go in the other room?

356
00:44:16,158 --> 00:44:17,921
Of course.

357
00:44:34,176 --> 00:44:38,135
- You're a capable woman, Agda.
- I'm glad you think so.

358
00:44:42,184 --> 00:44:44,914
We had some good times too.

359
00:44:45,087 --> 00:44:49,524
I mean together in the circus,
before you inherited the shop.

360
00:44:49,692 --> 00:44:54,527
I didn't like you training the boys.
I was always freezing and afraid.

361
00:44:54,697 --> 00:44:58,258
No, those were hard years.
- Why did you stay?

362
00:44:58,434 --> 00:45:01,335
- I was in love.
- But it passed?

363
00:45:01,503 --> 00:45:03,733
Need we speak of that?

364
00:45:03,906 --> 00:45:06,636
No, perhaps not.

365
00:45:07,109 --> 00:45:10,567
First it was infatuation.
Then it was love.

366
00:45:10,813 --> 00:45:16,115
But when you left me,
all that died practically overnight.

367
00:45:16,285 --> 00:45:17,650
It was very strange.

368
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:19,583
I didn't leave you.

369
00:45:19,755 --> 00:45:22,622
You stayed here with the shop,
and I moved on.

370
00:45:22,791 --> 00:45:24,782
Let's not talk about it.

371
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:31,263
You're so clear-headed.
I'm always in a muddle.

372
00:45:32,001 --> 00:45:35,198
Are you in trouble?
I mean, financially?

373
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:37,862
Need you ask?

374
00:45:39,308 --> 00:45:42,072
Cheers, Albert.

375
00:45:42,244 --> 00:45:44,872
Cheers, Agda.
Thanks for the meal.

376
00:45:55,758 --> 00:45:57,885
It's so quiet here.

377
00:45:58,494 --> 00:46:01,622
It's always the same,
summer and winter.

378
00:46:03,699 --> 00:46:05,997
Yes, it's a quiet street.

379
00:46:06,835 --> 00:46:09,326
Year in and year out...

380
00:46:09,905 --> 00:46:11,702
everything stands still.

381
00:46:11,874 --> 00:46:14,536
For me it's fulfillment.

382
00:46:17,246 --> 00:46:19,214
For me it's emptiness.

383
00:46:32,261 --> 00:46:35,458
<i>In truth</i>

384
00:46:35,631 --> 00:46:37,690
<i>I am but a poor jester</i>

385
00:46:37,866 --> 00:46:42,565
<i>in this farce of dark shadows.</i>

386
00:46:49,445 --> 00:46:51,709
<i>Her deceitful heart,</i>

387
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,541
<i>her frailty,</i>

388
00:46:53,716 --> 00:46:57,083
<i>even her taunting indifference,</i>

389
00:46:57,252 --> 00:47:00,483
<i>turn my world
upside down every day</i>

390
00:47:00,656 --> 00:47:02,590
<i>and every hour.</i>

391
00:47:03,592 --> 00:47:05,355
I ask myself,

392
00:47:05,527 --> 00:47:08,325
<i>"Art thou Count Badrincourt
of Chamballe,</i>

393
00:47:08,497 --> 00:47:11,796
or the most miserable
of wretches?"

394
00:47:15,404 --> 00:47:17,599
Therefore, dagger,

395
00:47:17,773 --> 00:47:20,173
leap from thy hiding place

396
00:47:20,342 --> 00:47:25,177
and find a place
where thou canst slake thy thirst.

397
00:47:26,749 --> 00:47:31,584
How gladly I greet thee,
sweet mistress,

398
00:47:31,754 --> 00:47:35,190
and press thee to my breast.

399
00:47:36,592 --> 00:47:42,929
Let us celebrate our night of love
here in this quiet park,

400
00:47:43,098 --> 00:47:50,004
where first my cruel goddess
did grant me her favor.

401
00:47:56,411 --> 00:47:58,971
Farewell, O world.

402
00:48:00,949 --> 00:48:04,043
Farewell, my sovereign lady.

403
00:48:05,821 --> 00:48:10,690
May thy tears water
my poor grave.

404
00:48:12,795 --> 00:48:14,990
I die...

405
00:48:47,729 --> 00:48:49,321
<i>Curtain up!</i>

406
00:48:50,732 --> 00:48:52,825
<i>Everyone on stage!</i>

407
00:48:56,705 --> 00:48:59,071
That's it for today.

408
00:48:59,241 --> 00:49:03,143
That was dreadful.
I hope it's better tomorrow.

409
00:49:03,312 --> 00:49:07,339
Blom, you're an idiot.
- Thank you, sir. I know.

410
00:50:42,844 --> 00:50:45,404
I want to leave the circus.

411
00:50:47,249 --> 00:50:49,376
You're laughing at me.

412
00:50:50,085 --> 00:50:53,885
I think you're beautiful.
That's why I'm smiling.

413
00:50:55,290 --> 00:50:59,056
You don't have to marry me.
Just look after me.

414
00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:20,345
You smell of stables,
cheap perfume and sweat.

415
00:51:21,116 --> 00:51:24,017
But I'll lick you clean
like a dog.

416
00:51:25,253 --> 00:51:27,312
What makeup!

417
00:51:27,489 --> 00:51:29,047
Come. I'll teach you.

418
00:51:37,065 --> 00:51:38,589
Let's see that mouth.

419
00:51:38,767 --> 00:51:42,259
- Do I really smell of sweat?
- I was only teasing.

420
00:51:42,437 --> 00:51:44,928
It's true.
My perfume isn't very nice.

421
00:51:45,107 --> 00:51:46,904
Use some of mine.

422
00:51:47,109 --> 00:51:48,440
Here.

423
00:51:48,610 --> 00:51:50,874
You have beautiful hands.

424
00:52:02,491 --> 00:52:04,857
How lovely!
It must be expensive.

425
00:52:05,026 --> 00:52:06,653
It's yours.

426
00:52:07,796 --> 00:52:10,526
I can't help it if my dress
smells of manure.

427
00:52:10,699 --> 00:52:13,827
Everything in our wagon does.

428
00:52:15,070 --> 00:52:17,334
Make me up now.

429
00:52:18,573 --> 00:52:21,041
What do you need makeup for?

430
00:52:22,077 --> 00:52:24,637
- Who gave you this?
- It's for luck.

431
00:52:24,813 --> 00:52:26,781
It's from a woman!

432
00:52:28,884 --> 00:52:31,182
I'll be gone when he gets back.

433
00:52:31,353 --> 00:52:34,720
No more Spanish señorita
to ride his bony nag,

434
00:52:34,890 --> 00:52:39,327
no more damsel in tights
for the drunk conjurer to saw in two.

435
00:52:39,494 --> 00:52:41,428
I won't be there.

436
00:52:41,596 --> 00:52:46,033
- And when you tire of me?
- I'll kill you, of course.

437
00:52:46,201 --> 00:52:48,431
If I don't kill you first.

438
00:52:48,603 --> 00:52:52,164
Oh, I'm very strong.
Feel!

439
00:52:53,175 --> 00:52:54,233
Very strong.

440
00:52:54,409 --> 00:52:58,038
- I can crack nuts with my teeth too.
- Now I'm scared.

441
00:52:58,213 --> 00:53:02,013
I can ride great geldings
bareback at a full gallop,

442
00:53:02,184 --> 00:53:05,711
holding on with just my thighs.
Could you do that?

443
00:53:07,789 --> 00:53:09,723
No, I don't think so.

444
00:53:09,891 --> 00:53:12,257
You're a poor weakling.

445
00:53:14,262 --> 00:53:17,322
You have a very nice body,
but you don't exercise.

446
00:53:17,499 --> 00:53:19,797
You're flabby.
- Watch your tongue!

447
00:53:20,802 --> 00:53:24,033
Shall we arm-wrestle?
I bet I'll win.

448
00:53:24,239 --> 00:53:26,207
You eat too much.

449
00:53:59,774 --> 00:54:01,867
Let me go!

450
00:54:02,043 --> 00:54:04,534
I don't want to!

451
00:54:04,713 --> 00:54:07,238
You want me to let go of you?

452
00:54:07,716 --> 00:54:09,684
I can't!

453
00:54:10,185 --> 00:54:13,313
I don't want to. Let me go.

454
00:54:30,572 --> 00:54:32,267
Give me the key.

455
00:54:32,507 --> 00:54:37,240
You're a circus girl. Tell me:
How do you make the bears dance?

456
00:54:37,479 --> 00:54:40,937
With red-hot irons?
- The key!

457
00:54:41,683 --> 00:54:44,516
- Do you hate me?
- Give me the key!

458
00:54:44,686 --> 00:54:48,349
You do.
I prefer you this way.

459
00:54:48,523 --> 00:54:50,115
The key!

460
00:54:50,692 --> 00:54:53,593
You shall have it... later.

461
00:54:55,931 --> 00:54:58,764
Let's finish our game first,
shall we?

462
00:55:00,502 --> 00:55:04,336
See this amulet?
It's very valuable.

463
00:55:04,506 --> 00:55:07,942
A gift from a grateful lady.

464
00:55:08,410 --> 00:55:11,573
If you're a good girl,
it shall be yours.

465
00:55:11,746 --> 00:55:15,739
You can buy pretty dresses,
live on it for a whole year.

466
00:55:16,351 --> 00:55:20,947
You can leave the circus.
It will bring you good luck.

467
00:55:21,323 --> 00:55:25,384
You can sell it to the goldsmith
around the corner this afternoon.

468
00:55:25,694 --> 00:55:27,719
I can live on it?

469
00:55:27,896 --> 00:55:30,262
For at least a year, Anne.

470
00:55:30,432 --> 00:55:33,299
Real pearls.
See for yourself.

471
00:55:35,337 --> 00:55:39,103
I can go afterwards?
You promise to give me the key?

472
00:55:39,741 --> 00:55:41,538
I promise.

473
00:55:41,977 --> 00:55:43,808
And never tell?

474
00:55:44,179 --> 00:55:46,443
And never tell.

475
00:56:16,878 --> 00:56:19,039
Here you are.

476
00:56:19,214 --> 00:56:21,978
I did what I could,
but you really should...

477
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:23,981
Thanks. Very kind.

478
00:56:34,229 --> 00:56:35,719
Thanks again.

479
00:56:37,966 --> 00:56:39,365
Well...

480
00:56:43,905 --> 00:56:45,338
Hello.

481
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:47,066
What is it?

482
00:56:47,242 --> 00:56:50,837
Mother, there's an old man
with a barrel organ

483
00:56:51,012 --> 00:56:54,106
and a monkey
that does tricks for a nickel.

484
00:56:54,282 --> 00:56:57,843
That's too much.
A nickel is lot of money.

485
00:56:58,019 --> 00:57:00,385
Can't I have one, Mother?

486
00:57:00,555 --> 00:57:02,921
I'll give you a nickel.

487
00:57:18,173 --> 00:57:19,697
Say thank you.

488
00:57:21,309 --> 00:57:23,903
Now off you go.
- Good-bye.

489
00:57:30,185 --> 00:57:31,743
Tired?

490
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:34,115
The brandy and all the food.

491
00:57:35,723 --> 00:57:37,452
Agda.

492
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:42,461
This is hard to say.
I don't know where to start...

493
00:57:42,897 --> 00:57:44,592
Then don't.

494
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:47,791
- You won't get angry?
- I can't promise.

495
00:57:48,103 --> 00:57:50,697
All right. I promise.

496
00:57:52,574 --> 00:57:54,906
I want to stay here with you.

497
00:57:55,076 --> 00:57:59,843
I'm too old for the circus.
I can't go on. I don't want to.

498
00:58:01,349 --> 00:58:06,810
I want to lead a quiet life here with you
and watch my boys grow up.

499
00:58:08,323 --> 00:58:11,224
I could help out in the shop.

500
00:58:11,392 --> 00:58:15,795
I have a pleasant manner
when I try, you know.

501
00:58:17,999 --> 00:58:21,025
Tell me I can stay.
You won't regret it.

502
00:58:21,202 --> 00:58:23,170
I won't let you down again.

503
00:58:23,338 --> 00:58:25,772
Don't stand there
like a beggar.

504
00:58:27,642 --> 00:58:29,872
I am a beggar.

505
00:58:30,044 --> 00:58:33,377
But you're wrong
if you think it's money I'm after.

506
00:58:33,548 --> 00:58:39,043
I'll sell the tent, and costumes,
and my share of the horses

507
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:41,620
and put the money
into the shops.

508
00:58:41,789 --> 00:58:45,418
- You talk so much.
- And you say nothing.

509
00:58:45,593 --> 00:58:48,118
What do you want me to say?

510
00:58:49,097 --> 00:58:50,962
That I can stay.

511
00:58:54,903 --> 00:58:58,100
No, you can't stay.

512
00:58:59,274 --> 00:59:00,866
Is there someone else?

513
00:59:01,042 --> 00:59:03,602
What would that matter?

514
00:59:03,778 --> 00:59:07,236
I'm not the type
to spend my life alone,

515
00:59:07,682 --> 00:59:12,551
but no one's going to take away
my freedom or peace of mind.

516
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:15,186
You hear? No one.

517
01:02:22,810 --> 01:02:25,938
- Where did you go?
- Why do you ask?

518
01:02:26,781 --> 01:02:30,615
- Can't I ask a question?
- You said it so strangely.

519
01:02:30,785 --> 01:02:32,116
I did not.

520
01:02:32,286 --> 01:02:34,618
I went for a stroll in town.

521
01:02:35,289 --> 01:02:37,757
- Alone?
- What of it?

522
01:02:38,793 --> 01:02:41,694
- Is that all?
- And what about you?

523
01:02:41,863 --> 01:02:44,730
That's my business.
Besides, you already know.

524
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:49,433
I don't know what you
and your wife did all day.

525
01:02:49,604 --> 01:02:52,334
- We discussed you.
- Got a guilty conscience?

526
01:02:52,507 --> 01:02:55,067
- No, but I think you have.
- Why?

527
01:02:55,243 --> 01:02:58,110
Can't I go window-shopping?

528
01:03:01,916 --> 01:03:04,077
At the goldsmith's?

529
01:03:06,554 --> 01:03:08,920
- Were you spying on me?
- No.

530
01:03:09,090 --> 01:03:13,720
I happened to see you leave
the theater and go into the goldsmith's.

531
01:03:13,895 --> 01:03:15,590
What if I did?

532
01:03:16,697 --> 01:03:18,892
What business
did you have at the theater?

533
01:03:19,066 --> 01:03:22,467
I watched a rehearsal.
Is that a sin?

534
01:03:22,737 --> 01:03:26,332
- Who was there?
- Lots of people. I didn't know them.

535
01:03:26,507 --> 01:03:29,408
- Frans?
- Quite possibly.

536
01:03:29,577 --> 01:03:31,875
- Did you speak with him?
- No.

537
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:36,179
- Are you sure?
- We didn't speak a word.

538
01:03:36,350 --> 01:03:39,649
Why did you look
so disheveled when you left?

539
01:03:39,821 --> 01:03:41,789
I fell on the stairs
and hurt myself.

540
01:03:41,956 --> 01:03:44,618
Damn it!
It's like a cross-examination!

541
01:03:46,894 --> 01:03:48,555
Were you unfaithful?

542
01:03:48,729 --> 01:03:51,823
You're mad!
You have no right to...

543
01:04:04,078 --> 01:04:07,343
- Why so scared?
- I thought you were going to hit me.

544
01:04:07,515 --> 01:04:11,508
- Not if you tell the truth.
- I did speak to Frans.

545
01:04:11,686 --> 01:04:14,519
- Did you go in his dressing room?
- I just looked in.

546
01:04:14,689 --> 01:04:16,816
- You slept with him.
- No, I swear!

547
01:04:18,493 --> 01:04:20,154
Tell the truth

548
01:04:20,428 --> 01:04:22,794
or I'll smash your face in.

549
01:04:22,964 --> 01:04:24,955
You make me say things
that aren't true.

550
01:04:25,132 --> 01:04:29,068
I make you tell the truth.
I can see in your eyes you're lying!

551
01:04:29,237 --> 01:04:32,934
I went to his room. He gave me
an amulet he said I could sell.

552
01:04:33,107 --> 01:04:35,667
That's why I went
to the goldsmith's.

553
01:04:35,843 --> 01:04:39,006
- Where's this amulet?
- It was worthless!

554
01:04:39,180 --> 01:04:41,808
- And you slept with him for it?
- No!

555
01:04:42,083 --> 01:04:44,142
I can tell you're lying!

556
01:04:44,418 --> 01:04:48,548
Yell all you want!
No one will come running to help.

557
01:04:48,723 --> 01:04:52,591
I wasn't unfaithful to you!
I wasn't!

558
01:04:55,429 --> 01:05:00,423
I could beat the life out of you...
but it's not worth the trouble.

559
01:05:00,601 --> 01:05:03,263
Keep lying
if it makes you happy!

560
01:05:17,118 --> 01:05:19,586
I did sleep with Frans.

561
01:05:21,088 --> 01:05:23,352
But he practically raped me.

562
01:05:24,025 --> 01:05:27,222
He locked me in his room
and wouldn't let me out.

563
01:05:27,395 --> 01:05:30,592
I was afraid I'd be late
for the performance.

564
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:34,595
Then he gave me the amulet.

565
01:05:36,103 --> 01:05:40,563
He threatened me. I was scared
and didn't dare refuse.

566
01:05:42,710 --> 01:05:44,302
Say something!

567
01:05:45,646 --> 01:05:48,706
You want me to say you're lying?

568
01:05:49,684 --> 01:05:54,121
That I overheard him
proposing to you this morning?

569
01:05:54,722 --> 01:05:56,917
Want to know what I think?

570
01:05:57,491 --> 01:06:00,187
I think you went to see him

571
01:06:00,361 --> 01:06:02,659
because you're as sick
of the circus and me

572
01:06:02,830 --> 01:06:05,890
as I am of the circus and you.

573
01:06:15,843 --> 01:06:17,902
Stop laughing like that!

574
01:06:20,548 --> 01:06:23,415
We're all stuck, Anne.

575
01:06:24,318 --> 01:06:26,752
Stuck like hell.

576
01:06:27,121 --> 01:06:30,955
The performance tonight
will be sensational!

577
01:06:31,125 --> 01:06:34,492
No doubt about that.

578
01:06:34,662 --> 01:06:37,222
Not a doubt in the world.

579
01:06:39,066 --> 01:06:42,832
With horn music
for horned cattle,

580
01:06:43,004 --> 01:06:47,737
and tooting brass
for the farting herd!

581
01:07:06,260 --> 01:07:12,563
Well, I'll be damned!

582
01:07:40,795 --> 01:07:45,858
To your health, brother.

583
01:07:46,033 --> 01:07:47,762
Cheers.

584
01:07:55,009 --> 01:07:57,102
When I think about it,

585
01:07:58,045 --> 01:08:00,946
there isn't
a single person I hate.

586
01:08:01,682 --> 01:08:05,174
Not even the policeman
in the square today.

587
01:08:05,853 --> 01:08:08,617
I can't even hate Anne,

588
01:08:08,956 --> 01:08:11,390
even though
she's been unfaithful.

589
01:08:12,059 --> 01:08:14,527
But I know you despise me.

590
01:08:14,695 --> 01:08:17,789
You despise everybody,
yourself most of all!

591
01:08:17,965 --> 01:08:22,902
But I love people!
I wish I could caress them tenderly.

592
01:08:23,070 --> 01:08:25,163
I'm not afraid of them.

593
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:30,602
I don't want to travel
the countryside like an idiot

594
01:08:30,778 --> 01:08:32,769
with this lousy circus.

595
01:08:33,414 --> 01:08:35,746
I want out of the circus!

596
01:08:35,916 --> 01:08:37,975
I want to be an honest citizen

597
01:08:38,152 --> 01:08:42,316
with money in the bank
and a respectable wife.

598
01:08:44,892 --> 01:08:49,693
Anne, you'll never be
a respectable wife.

599
01:08:49,864 --> 01:08:52,264
I can tell you that much.

600
01:08:52,433 --> 01:08:55,027
And I'll never marry you

601
01:08:55,202 --> 01:08:57,363
because you were unfaithful!

602
01:08:58,272 --> 01:09:00,536
Poor little thing!

603
01:09:00,708 --> 01:09:06,476
Isn't it nice to be maudlin
and sentimental?

604
01:09:07,348 --> 01:09:09,043
Poor Anne...

605
01:09:09,216 --> 01:09:11,047
poor Agda...

606
01:09:11,218 --> 01:09:13,550
my poor little boys.

607
01:09:13,721 --> 01:09:15,951
And you, you devil!

608
01:09:16,123 --> 01:09:18,284
And your miserable wife.

609
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:22,256
It's a pity people
must live on this earth.

610
01:09:22,429 --> 01:09:25,125
It's a pity!

611
01:09:27,835 --> 01:09:30,030
They're all so frightened.

612
01:09:30,204 --> 01:09:32,263
So frightened.

613
01:09:32,439 --> 01:09:35,135
Yes, it's a shame.

614
01:09:35,643 --> 01:09:39,044
Yes, it's a shame to be Albert!

615
01:09:39,313 --> 01:09:42,043
It's a shame to be Albert!

616
01:09:42,349 --> 01:09:44,715
A shame!

617
01:09:49,190 --> 01:09:51,658
But now I'm going to rise up

618
01:09:52,326 --> 01:09:54,817
and do something
worthy of a human being.

619
01:09:54,995 --> 01:09:58,522
- You mean kill yourself?
- I didn't say that!

620
01:10:10,678 --> 01:10:14,614
I got this from Timba,
the tiger trainer.

621
01:10:14,782 --> 01:10:17,808
You ought to shoot the bear.

622
01:10:17,985 --> 01:10:21,614
It's in a bad way.

623
01:10:22,122 --> 01:10:25,182
Yes, I ought to shoot the bear.

624
01:10:25,359 --> 01:10:29,489
And don't forget
to shoot my wife too.

625
01:10:29,663 --> 01:10:32,894
It would be
an act of kindness.

626
01:10:35,302 --> 01:10:39,136
We should shoot everyone
we feel sorry for.

627
01:10:39,406 --> 01:10:42,102
Just five or six people.

628
01:10:43,944 --> 01:10:47,380
I should shoot you too,
my dear Frost!

629
01:10:47,548 --> 01:10:50,915
But I have my poor old dad
to care for!

630
01:10:51,685 --> 01:10:54,085
- Are you afraid?
- No.

631
01:10:54,455 --> 01:10:56,082
Yes, I am.

632
01:10:56,257 --> 01:10:59,283
- Afraid to die?
- Yes.

633
01:11:01,829 --> 01:11:03,524
Well...

634
01:11:06,967 --> 01:11:09,162
I'm not afraid of death.

635
01:11:09,336 --> 01:11:11,236
Then kill yourself!

636
01:11:11,405 --> 01:11:12,963
No!

637
01:11:13,374 --> 01:11:14,898
It's hot in here!

638
01:11:15,075 --> 01:11:18,943
Yes, let's get out!
Open the door!

639
01:11:28,489 --> 01:11:33,051
What a life!
Look at life all around us!

640
01:11:36,297 --> 01:11:39,425
I love it!

641
01:11:42,503 --> 01:11:46,803
<i>A soldier rides home
from a faraway land</i>

642
01:11:46,974 --> 01:11:51,070
<i>Leaving the war far behind</i>

643
01:11:51,578 --> 01:11:55,275
<i>The first thing he does
is to ask all he meets</i>

644
01:11:55,449 --> 01:11:59,818
<i>If his beloved
is still alive and well</i>

645
01:12:01,188 --> 01:12:05,022
<i>"She's very much alive
and doing well indeed</i>

646
01:12:05,192 --> 01:12:09,219
<i>For she's to marry
this very day"</i>

647
01:12:09,797 --> 01:12:13,756
<i>He quickens his pace
Like a bird he flies</i>

648
01:12:13,934 --> 01:12:19,304
<i>For to see
his Elin once again</i>

649
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:33,079
Damn it! Why try to wring
the truth out of Anne?

650
01:12:33,454 --> 01:12:36,719
What's it matter if they cheat on you,
as long as you don't know?

651
01:12:36,890 --> 01:12:38,881
So now you're jealous?

652
01:12:40,027 --> 01:12:42,291
I'll crush her
with my own two hands.

653
01:12:42,463 --> 01:12:46,399
I'll beg her forgiveness
and ask her to tell me everything.

654
01:12:46,900 --> 01:12:48,834
Am I going mad?

655
01:12:49,003 --> 01:12:52,996
I'll ask her to tell me
every detail of what they did.

656
01:12:53,173 --> 01:12:55,471
Is that mad?
Do you understand?

657
01:12:55,642 --> 01:12:58,611
No, but I don't give a damn.

658
01:12:59,613 --> 01:13:02,912
Little Anne.
Simple little Anne.

659
01:13:03,083 --> 01:13:05,574
My little sweetheart,
my little girl.

660
01:13:06,553 --> 01:13:09,852
Why should
that blasted hussy leave me?

661
01:13:10,357 --> 01:13:13,758
I'll do the same!
- Got it off your chest now?

662
01:13:14,428 --> 01:13:17,864
- You're cold as an icicle!
- Let's get up!

663
01:13:18,098 --> 01:13:20,293
Come on!

664
01:13:42,389 --> 01:13:47,190
Quiet, everyone!
Start getting ready for the show!

665
01:13:47,761 --> 01:13:51,697
The police have
both our horses!

666
01:13:51,865 --> 01:13:54,129
Albert's drunk!

667
01:13:56,336 --> 01:14:00,170
Hurry up now!
The show starts in an hour!

668
01:14:00,340 --> 01:14:03,776
- Peter, did you fill the lamps?
- Yes, but we're low on fuel.

669
01:14:03,944 --> 01:14:07,778
Then we'll shorten the program!
Now hurry!

670
01:14:08,549 --> 01:14:10,813
And you, you damned dwarf!

671
01:14:10,984 --> 01:14:14,681
I'll either sack you
or kill you right on the spot!

672
01:14:15,322 --> 01:14:20,282
Off with you, and be funny!
We start in one hour!

673
01:14:20,461 --> 01:14:24,261
But no lewdness!
This is a respectable town!

674
01:14:24,431 --> 01:14:26,331
Go on now!

675
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:30,402
You got a good kick!

676
01:14:33,540 --> 01:14:35,269
I have to leave them.

677
01:15:22,256 --> 01:15:24,349
It's my honor...

678
01:15:36,904 --> 01:15:41,000
We have to end this number
and get on with the show.

679
01:15:48,815 --> 01:15:53,343
I'll tell my mommy!

680
01:15:54,454 --> 01:15:57,116
I'll climb up here and...

681
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:02,485
That was scary!

682
01:16:10,704 --> 01:16:14,640
We'll have some schnapps!

683
01:16:18,579 --> 01:16:21,673
Here you go!

684
01:16:22,616 --> 01:16:25,312
<i>The actors are coming!</i>

685
01:16:36,196 --> 01:16:38,664
<i>The actors are here!</i>

686
01:17:27,481 --> 01:17:29,176
Silence!

687
01:17:29,349 --> 01:17:32,978
Ladies and gentlemen,
now for the highlight of the evening!

688
01:17:33,153 --> 01:17:37,351
A fiery Spanish rider astride
an Andalusian thoroughbred!

689
01:17:37,524 --> 01:17:39,651
An act you'll never forget!

690
01:17:39,826 --> 01:17:41,054
Here she comes!

691
01:17:52,039 --> 01:17:54,974
Feel all right after
our adventure, sweetheart?

692
01:18:17,197 --> 01:18:18,994
How about
another ride tonight?

693
01:19:52,125 --> 01:19:54,958
Ladies and gentlemen,
the situation is clear.

694
01:19:55,128 --> 01:19:57,392
These gentlemen
have insulted each other.

695
01:19:57,564 --> 01:20:01,398
Let us be witnesses
to this duel.

696
01:20:01,568 --> 01:20:03,968
Set your whip aside, sir.

697
01:20:04,137 --> 01:20:06,264
- Alfredo!
- Coming!

698
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:09,637
No snuffboxes or knives allowed.

699
01:20:09,810 --> 01:20:11,471
Begin!

700
01:21:08,101 --> 01:21:10,467
That's it, Albert!

701
01:22:10,997 --> 01:22:12,464
I'll get him!

702
01:22:12,832 --> 01:22:14,424
I'll get him!

703
01:22:28,582 --> 01:22:30,345
Where is he?

704
01:22:30,517 --> 01:22:31,984
There!

705
01:22:32,285 --> 01:22:33,752
I'll get him!

706
01:22:52,238 --> 01:22:54,638
Ladies and gentlemen...

707
01:22:55,108 --> 01:22:58,339
the show's over.

708
01:22:59,412 --> 01:23:03,348
Thank you all
for coming this evening.

709
01:24:41,347 --> 01:24:42,837
Dorothy...

710
01:24:43,950 --> 01:24:46,111
Iook what I brought you.

711
01:24:47,153 --> 01:24:49,018
Eat something, Dorothy.

712
01:25:02,135 --> 01:25:04,729
<i>Albert!</i>

713
01:25:05,805 --> 01:25:07,864
<i>Open the door!</i>

714
01:25:09,109 --> 01:25:11,270
<i>Let me in!</i>

715
01:26:42,402 --> 01:26:44,962
Albert, are you dead?

716
01:26:45,538 --> 01:26:48,871
You're not?
Aren't you going to open up?

717
01:26:49,042 --> 01:26:51,442
Go to hell and leave me alone!

718
01:26:51,611 --> 01:26:54,637
All right, we'll go to hell.

719
01:27:07,293 --> 01:27:10,956
No, Albert! No!

720
01:27:43,897 --> 01:27:47,230
- Can we strike the tent?
- Do as you like.

721
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:51,632
- It was a good take tonight.
- Split it between you and shut up!

722
01:29:15,288 --> 01:29:16,755
Jens!

723
01:29:20,893 --> 01:29:24,158
See to Prince's left front shoe
before we go.

724
01:29:24,330 --> 01:29:27,299
- We're going?
- That's right.

725
01:29:59,465 --> 01:30:03,959
I had a dream this afternoon
while I slept off the booze.

726
01:30:04,737 --> 01:30:08,332
I dreamt that Alma
came to me and said,

727
01:30:08,674 --> 01:30:12,633
<i>"Poor Frost,
you look tired and sad.</i>

728
01:30:12,812 --> 01:30:15,508
Wouldn't you like
to rest a while?"

729
01:30:15,681 --> 01:30:17,911
<i>"Yes," I said.</i>

730
01:30:18,084 --> 01:30:22,646
<i>"I'll make you small
as a little unborn child," she said.</i>

731
01:30:22,822 --> 01:30:26,189
<i>"You can climb into my womb</i>

732
01:30:26,359 --> 01:30:29,817
and sleep in peace."

733
01:30:30,430 --> 01:30:35,026
So I did as she said
and crept inside her womb,

734
01:30:35,201 --> 01:30:38,932
and I slept there
so soundly and peacefully,

735
01:30:39,105 --> 01:30:42,905
rocked to sleep
as if in a cradle.

736
01:30:43,076 --> 01:30:45,636
Then I got smaller and smaller,

737
01:30:45,812 --> 01:30:49,339
until at last
I was just a tiny seed,

738
01:30:49,515 --> 01:30:51,346
and then I was gone.

739
01:30:51,517 --> 01:30:55,044
Stop trudging along out there.
Come inside and sleep!

740
01:30:55,221 --> 01:31:00,625
You see? She can't sleep
without me beside her!

741
01:31:03,863 --> 01:31:05,490
Good night.

742
01:32:14,500 --> 01:32:20,496
SAWDUST AND TINSEL
