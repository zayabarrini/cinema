1
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:40,239
DIGITALLY RESTORED IN 2015

2
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,012
THE SILENCE

3
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:36,191
What does that mean?

4
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:39,111
I don't know.

5
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:19,720
- What are you looking at?
- Your feet.

6
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:21,850
Why?

7
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:25,305
They walk you around all the time,
all by themselves.

8
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:35,986
Hadn't we better try
to get hold of a doctor?

9
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:41,116
Are you cold?
- A little.

10
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:43,496
The heat's awful.

11
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,872
If I can rest now, we can leave tomorrow
and be home by Monday.

12
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,372
Thank goodness for that.

13
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,499
I know you're glad.

14
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,717
Is it stuffy in here?

15
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:56,804
So-so.

16
00:09:58,223 --> 00:09:59,839
Open the window, then.

17
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:09,978
- May I shut the door?
- Of course.

18
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:49,514
Johan.

19
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,441
Come here and scrub my back.

20
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:53,938
I'm coming.

21
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,687
That'll do.

22
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,516
Go wait in the other room.

23
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,314
We're going to take a nap.

24
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,563
Take off your shirt and trousers.

25
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:37,958
Come here.

26
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:08,859
Yes?

27
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:47,833
Hand.

28
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:25,573
Mommy.

29
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:37,749
Johan, do be quiet.

30
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,921
I told you I want to sleep.

31
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:36,222
Good day.

32
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:03,295
You're quite tan.

33
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,220
I'm going out.

34
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:09,514
Wait.

35
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:14,932
What is it?

36
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:16,263
Nothing.

37
00:30:17,858 --> 00:30:19,269
All right.

38
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:47,218
This is humiliating. I won't stand for it.

39
00:30:54,478 --> 00:30:56,515
I must keep my head.

40
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:01,724
I'm known as a level-headed person.

41
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:08,402
Dear God, please let me die at home!

42
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:24,205
That's better.

43
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:31,342
I must try and eat something.
My stomach feels empty.

44
00:31:32,933 --> 00:31:37,303
How stupid of me
to drink on an empty stomach.

45
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:25,835
Thank you.

46
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:42,338
Are you hungry?

47
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:46,809
You're welcome to have some of my food.

48
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:02,108
Are you homesick?

49
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:05,243
We'll be home on Monday.

50
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:09,081
- May I go to Granny's then?
- Right away.

51
00:36:11,211 --> 00:36:15,421
- How long will I stay there?
- All summer and next winter, too.

52
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:18,465
You'll go to school there.

53
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:21,840
Will Mommy come visit me?

54
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:23,341
Sure.

55
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:24,842
And Papa?

56
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:27,471
If he has the time.

57
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,768
But he's a busy man.

58
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:31,974
That's true.

59
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:36,267
But there are other nice things. Horses...

60
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:39,604
I'm pretty scared of horses.

61
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:41,485
Is that so?

62
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:46,072
Well, there are rabbits.

63
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:48,620
And you can go sailing with Uncle Persson.

64
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:51,620
The water's lovely and green

65
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:54,453
and so clear you can see the bottom.

66
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,800
Cheer up.

67
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,091
Will you be there?

68
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:13,270
You can go fishing.

69
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:15,356
What do you catch?

70
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:17,191
Perch.

71
00:37:18,111 --> 00:37:19,773
And sometimes dace.

72
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:26,784
I've had enough. Thank you.

73
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,862
Leave the door open please.

74
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:33,783
I'll draw you a nice picture, if you like.

75
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:45,753
Don't worry. Mommy will be back soon.

76
00:37:46,723 --> 00:37:48,305
And I'm here.

77
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:26,958
Are you feeling better?

78
00:47:27,053 --> 00:47:28,715
That's good.

79
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:11,359
- What are you doing?
- Working, as you can see.

80
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:16,903
Then mind your own business
and don't spy on me.

81
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:28,038
To think that I've been afraid of you.

82
00:51:48,314 --> 00:51:49,725
When are we going home?

83
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:53,186
This evening perhaps.

84
00:51:54,695 --> 00:51:56,311
Is Ester going with us?

85
00:51:57,489 --> 00:51:58,900
I don't know.

86
00:52:13,589 --> 00:52:15,581
What's this town called?

87
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:18,545
Timoka, I think.

88
00:52:52,378 --> 00:52:53,789
What is that?

89
00:52:54,505 --> 00:52:55,871
"Music"?

90
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:36,044
Can you give Johan some cigarettes?
I'm all out.

91
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,621
Mine are on the desk.

92
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:42,174
- May I take a couple?
- Sure.

93
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:51,764
Thank you very much.

94
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:57,932
I think the two of you
should leave tonight.

95
00:53:59,278 --> 00:54:01,486
We can't leave you like this.

96
00:54:01,572 --> 00:54:05,691
I'm not up to traveling yet.
In a few days perhaps.

97
00:54:13,292 --> 00:54:16,376
- What's that music?
- Bach.

98
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:25,213
It's nice.

99
00:54:38,901 --> 00:54:40,813
I'm going out for a while.

100
00:54:40,903 --> 00:54:43,190
I can't stand the heat in here.

101
00:54:55,751 --> 00:54:56,992
I'll be back soon.

102
00:54:58,212 --> 00:55:00,078
Why don't you read to Ester?

103
00:55:00,172 --> 00:55:02,835
Go while your conscience lets you.

104
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:25,608
Johan, step outside for a while.
I want to talk to Anna alone.

105
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:29,445
- Aren't I going to read to you?
- Later.

106
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:35,742
I'll go out in the hallway.

107
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:37,369
Don't go too far.

108
00:55:55,644 --> 00:55:57,476
Where have you been?

109
00:55:57,563 --> 00:55:59,145
Out for a walk.

110
00:56:02,276 --> 00:56:03,687
Where did you go?

111
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:05,313
Oh, not far.

112
00:56:05,404 --> 00:56:07,521
That was a long walk.

113
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:09,150
I didn't want to come back here.

114
00:56:09,241 --> 00:56:10,652
Why not?

115
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:12,859
I didn't feel like it.

116
00:56:12,953 --> 00:56:14,410
You're lying.

117
00:56:15,122 --> 00:56:17,159
Do you want to know all the details?

118
00:56:19,668 --> 00:56:21,660
Just answer my questions.

119
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:25,747
Remember that winter ten years ago
when we stayed with Father in Lyons?

120
00:56:27,092 --> 00:56:29,084
I had been out with Claude.

121
00:56:33,265 --> 00:56:36,508
You interrogated me that time, too.

122
00:56:36,602 --> 00:56:40,812
Said you'd tell Father
if I didn't tell you everything.

123
00:56:40,898 --> 00:56:42,355
In detail.

124
00:56:48,947 --> 00:56:52,531
I went to the cinema
and sat in a box at the back.

125
00:56:53,911 --> 00:56:57,450
A man and a woman
made love right in front of me.

126
00:56:58,165 --> 00:56:59,997
When they were finished, they left.

127
00:57:01,877 --> 00:57:04,415
A man came in, someone I'd met at the bar.

128
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:08,252
He sat down next to me
and started stroking my thighs.

129
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:12,627
Then we had intercourse on the floor.

130
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:15,596
That's how my dress got dirty.

131
00:57:21,647 --> 00:57:23,229
Is that true?

132
00:57:24,566 --> 00:57:26,182
Why would I lie?

133
00:57:29,196 --> 00:57:32,064
Right. Why would you?

134
00:57:33,325 --> 00:57:35,658
It so happens that I was lying.

135
00:57:35,744 --> 00:57:37,326
It doesn't matter.

136
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:42,824
I sat and watched that couple make love.

137
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:47,620
Then I went to the bar,

138
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:49,546
and this man left with me.

139
00:57:50,676 --> 00:57:53,510
I didn't know where to go,
so we went into a church.

140
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:58,677
We had intercourse
in a dark corner behind some pillars.

141
00:58:00,686 --> 00:58:02,427
It was cooler there.

142
00:58:06,817 --> 00:58:08,228
I see.

143
00:58:09,861 --> 00:58:12,945
This time I'll make sure
I get my clothes off first.

144
00:58:18,996 --> 00:58:20,988
Shouldn't you go to bed?

145
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:47,138
Sit with me.

146
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:49,815
Here, on the edge of the bed.

147
00:58:50,736 --> 00:58:52,477
Just for a moment.

148
00:59:01,121 --> 00:59:03,033
Are you going to meet him?

149
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:08,543
Please don't.

150
00:59:09,713 --> 00:59:11,295
Not tonight.

151
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:17,836
It's such torment.

152
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:19,215
Why is that?

153
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:21,756
Because...

154
00:59:24,603 --> 00:59:26,765
I feel humiliated.

155
00:59:30,484 --> 00:59:32,771
You mustn't think I'm jealous.

156
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:40,195
I have to go.

157
01:00:48,103 --> 01:00:49,344
No.

158
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:28,167
You were going to read to me.

159
01:05:29,634 --> 01:05:31,546
You look strange.

160
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:41,977
How about reading to me now?

161
01:05:42,814 --> 01:05:45,056
I'll show you my Punch and Judy instead.

162
01:06:05,837 --> 01:06:08,250
Help! I'm dying!

163
01:06:10,341 --> 01:06:11,957
What's he saying?

164
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:13,587
I don't know.

165
01:06:13,678 --> 01:06:16,546
He's scared,
so he speaks in a funny language.

166
01:06:17,432 --> 01:06:19,549
Can't Punch sing instead?

167
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:23,181
Yes, but not while he's still angry.

168
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:45,819
How nice...

169
01:08:50,001 --> 01:08:53,085
How nice that we don't
understand each other.

170
01:09:13,316 --> 01:09:15,854
I wish Ester were dead.

171
01:09:37,548 --> 01:09:38,789
Ester.

172
01:09:40,385 --> 01:09:42,502
Why are you a translator?

173
01:09:43,012 --> 01:09:46,722
So that you can read books
written in a foreign language.

174
01:09:47,892 --> 01:09:49,804
Do you know the language here?

175
01:09:49,894 --> 01:09:52,227
No, but I've learned a few words.

176
01:09:54,774 --> 01:09:57,016
Don't forget to write them down for me.

177
01:09:57,568 --> 01:09:59,104
I won't.

178
01:10:04,951 --> 01:10:07,489
Why doesn't Mommy want to be with us?

179
01:10:07,578 --> 01:10:09,160
Oh, but she does.

180
01:10:09,247 --> 01:10:12,581
No, she leaves whenever she can.

181
01:10:13,543 --> 01:10:15,500
She's just gone out for a walk.

182
01:10:15,586 --> 01:10:17,202
No, she hasn't.

183
01:10:17,839 --> 01:10:19,125
She hasn't?

184
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:22,549
She's with somebody.
They kissed and kissed.

185
01:10:22,635 --> 01:10:24,843
Then they went into a room.

186
01:10:24,929 --> 01:10:26,591
I saw them myself.

187
01:10:28,099 --> 01:10:30,011
Are you sure about that?

188
01:10:30,101 --> 01:10:31,637
I saw them.

189
01:10:46,826 --> 01:10:48,909
Have you washed properly?

190
01:10:48,995 --> 01:10:51,203
No. Do I have to?

191
01:10:54,876 --> 01:10:58,040
We were hoping to enjoy this trip.

192
01:10:58,129 --> 01:10:59,665
But instead...

193
01:10:59,756 --> 01:11:01,622
I've had great fun.

194
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:12,303
Mommy's the only one who may touch you,
isn't she?

195
01:11:17,774 --> 01:11:19,936
We love Mommy, you and I.

196
01:11:30,328 --> 01:11:32,991
Do you know
what "face" is in this language?

197
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:36,247
It's <i>najgo.</i>

198
01:11:36,334 --> 01:11:37,825
And "hand" is <i>kasi.</i>

199
01:11:48,888 --> 01:11:51,596
When she's ill, she wants her own way.

200
01:11:51,682 --> 01:11:53,674
Then I'm the idiot, of course.

201
01:11:58,272 --> 01:12:00,514
"What a glutton you are," she says.

202
01:12:02,401 --> 01:12:04,814
"How fat you've gotten lately.

203
01:12:06,489 --> 01:12:08,321
You need to go on a diet."

204
01:12:17,458 --> 01:12:19,199
I like food.

205
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:25,039
So would she if she didn't drink so much.

206
01:12:30,888 --> 01:12:32,971
I'm a good driver, though.

207
01:12:34,684 --> 01:12:36,846
Even Ester admits that much.

208
01:12:52,618 --> 01:12:54,405
Are you in there?

209
01:12:56,497 --> 01:12:58,329
What do you want?

210
01:13:01,752 --> 01:13:03,789
I need to talk to you.

211
01:13:15,975 --> 01:13:17,762
She's still there.

212
01:13:20,271 --> 01:13:21,887
She's crying.

213
01:14:04,523 --> 01:14:06,014
Where are you?

214
01:15:16,595 --> 01:15:20,054
- What have I done to deserve this?
- Nothing in particular.

215
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:26,979
It's just that you always
harp on your principles

216
01:15:27,606 --> 01:15:30,394
and drone on
about how important everything is.

217
01:15:31,736 --> 01:15:33,773
But it's all just hot air.

218
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:36,237
You know why?

219
01:15:38,576 --> 01:15:40,192
I'll tell you.

220
01:15:41,662 --> 01:15:44,951
Everything centers around your ego.

221
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:49,289
You can't live without feeling superior.
That's the truth.

222
01:15:50,296 --> 01:15:54,540
Everything has to be desperately
important and meaningful

223
01:15:54,633 --> 01:15:56,465
and goodness knows what.

224
01:15:56,552 --> 01:15:58,669
How else are we to live?

225
01:15:58,763 --> 01:16:01,005
I used to think you were right.

226
01:16:01,098 --> 01:16:04,842
I tried to be like you
because I admired you.

227
01:16:06,479 --> 01:16:09,017
I didn't realize you disliked me.

228
01:16:09,106 --> 01:16:11,644
- That's not true.
- Oh, yes, it is.

229
01:16:13,235 --> 01:16:16,945
You always have.
I just never realized it before.

230
01:16:17,031 --> 01:16:18,772
- No.
- Yes.

231
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:22,742
And in some way you're afraid of me.

232
01:16:22,828 --> 01:16:24,615
I'm not afraid of you.

233
01:16:25,956 --> 01:16:27,993
I love you.

234
01:16:28,084 --> 01:16:30,167
You always talk a lot about love.

235
01:16:30,252 --> 01:16:32,960
- You can't say —
- What can't I say?

236
01:16:34,215 --> 01:16:36,081
That Ester feels hatred?

237
01:16:36,842 --> 01:16:39,835
That's just a silly idea of mine, right?

238
01:16:41,472 --> 01:16:45,056
You hate me, just like you hate yourself.

239
01:16:45,142 --> 01:16:46,849
Me and everything that's mine.

240
01:16:47,812 --> 01:16:50,395
You're full of hate.
- That's not true.

241
01:16:53,025 --> 01:16:55,062
With all your education

242
01:16:55,152 --> 01:16:58,896
and all the fancy books you've translated...

243
01:17:00,032 --> 01:17:02,149
can you answer me one thing?

244
01:17:07,915 --> 01:17:11,579
When Father died,
you said, "I don't want to go on living."

245
01:17:14,547 --> 01:17:16,630
So, why are you still around?

246
01:17:19,343 --> 01:17:21,130
Is it for my sake?

247
01:17:22,346 --> 01:17:23,757
For Johan's?

248
01:17:25,349 --> 01:17:27,341
For your work perhaps?

249
01:17:29,186 --> 01:17:31,223
Or for no reason in particular?

250
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:38,269
It's not like you say.
I'm sure you've got it all wrong.

251
01:17:38,362 --> 01:17:40,979
Don't use that tone of voice!

252
01:17:43,367 --> 01:17:46,030
Get out! Leave me alone!

253
01:17:49,582 --> 01:17:51,164
Poor Anna.

254
01:17:52,668 --> 01:17:54,625
Why don't you shut up?

255
01:18:03,262 --> 01:18:05,299
Poor Anna.

256
01:23:34,259 --> 01:23:37,093
Johan and I are going across the street
for a bite to eat.

257
01:23:39,890 --> 01:23:42,473
We're leaving on the 2:00 train.

258
01:23:46,104 --> 01:23:48,061
This heat is awful.

259
01:23:55,113 --> 01:23:56,524
Good-bye.

260
01:23:58,325 --> 01:24:00,032
I'll be back soon.

261
01:24:00,118 --> 01:24:01,450
Good-bye.

262
01:24:28,897 --> 01:24:31,105
Give me my writing things.

263
01:24:49,918 --> 01:24:52,035
TO JOHAN

264
01:24:59,386 --> 01:25:01,594
WORDS IN A FOREIGN...

265
01:26:05,994 --> 01:26:09,829
She's been gone an hour,
and she took the boy with her.

266
01:26:31,478 --> 01:26:33,219
Erectile tissue.

267
01:26:37,025 --> 01:26:40,189
It's all a matter
of erections and secretions.

268
01:26:46,118 --> 01:26:49,282
A confession before extreme unction.

269
01:26:49,371 --> 01:26:51,704
Semen smells nasty to me.

270
01:26:53,208 --> 01:26:55,700
I have a very keen sense of smell,

271
01:26:56,294 --> 01:27:00,004
and I stank like a rotten fish
when I was fertilized.

272
01:27:09,391 --> 01:27:11,053
It's optional.

273
01:27:24,990 --> 01:27:27,824
I didn't want to accept my wretched role.

274
01:27:31,663 --> 01:27:34,076
But now it's too damn lonely.

275
01:27:37,043 --> 01:27:39,205
We try out attitudes

276
01:27:39,963 --> 01:27:42,296
and find them all worthless.

277
01:27:44,342 --> 01:27:46,425
The forces are too strong.

278
01:27:49,598 --> 01:27:51,260
I mean the forces...

279
01:27:52,893 --> 01:27:54,759
the horrible forces.

280
01:27:59,441 --> 01:28:01,558
You need to watch your step

281
01:28:02,110 --> 01:28:04,443
among all the ghosts and memories.

282
01:28:15,832 --> 01:28:17,039
All this talk...

283
01:28:20,128 --> 01:28:23,417
There's no need to discuss loneliness.

284
01:28:24,174 --> 01:28:26,086
It's a waste of time.

285
01:28:28,512 --> 01:28:30,674
Give me my writing things.

286
01:28:49,199 --> 01:28:51,987
I'm feeling much better now,
let me tell you.

287
01:28:55,163 --> 01:28:57,655
Do you know what my condition is called?

288
01:28:58,708 --> 01:29:00,119
Euphoria.

289
01:29:00,669 --> 01:29:05,881
It was the same with Father.
He would laugh and joke.

290
01:29:09,553 --> 01:29:11,419
Then he looked at me.

291
01:29:12,514 --> 01:29:15,177
"Now it's eternity, Ester," he said.

292
01:29:17,310 --> 01:29:18,926
He was so kind.

293
01:29:21,565 --> 01:29:23,898
Though he was such a big, heavy man.

294
01:29:24,985 --> 01:29:27,193
He weighed nearly 440 pounds.

295
01:29:28,613 --> 01:29:31,731
I wish I'd seen the men
who had to lift his coffin.

296
01:29:33,285 --> 01:29:34,992
I'm so tired.

297
01:30:14,367 --> 01:30:17,326
No, I don't want to die like this.

298
01:30:19,539 --> 01:30:21,622
I don't want to suffocate.

299
01:30:21,708 --> 01:30:25,042
Oh, that was horrible. Now I'm frightened.

300
01:30:25,128 --> 01:30:26,915
That scared me.

301
01:30:28,340 --> 01:30:30,252
That mustn't happen again.

302
01:30:40,268 --> 01:30:44,683
Where's the doctor? Must I die all alone?

303
01:31:02,457 --> 01:31:03,573
Mother.

304
01:31:04,334 --> 01:31:05,996
I'm ill.

305
01:31:06,628 --> 01:31:10,372
Mother, come and help me.

306
01:31:12,467 --> 01:31:14,129
I'm so frightened.

307
01:31:20,183 --> 01:31:22,015
I don't want to die.

308
01:31:55,510 --> 01:31:57,376
Don't be afraid.

309
01:31:58,346 --> 01:32:00,087
I'm not going to die.

310
01:32:10,984 --> 01:32:12,941
I'm pulling myself together.

311
01:32:13,987 --> 01:32:15,273
I see.

312
01:32:17,824 --> 01:32:21,113
I've written you a letter,
just like I promised.

313
01:32:23,204 --> 01:32:24,866
It's on the floor...

314
01:32:26,166 --> 01:32:27,873
if you can find it.

315
01:32:36,885 --> 01:32:38,547
It's important.

316
01:32:39,679 --> 01:32:41,466
You'll understand.

317
01:32:41,556 --> 01:32:43,798
We have to hurry.
The train leaves in an hour.

318
01:32:45,435 --> 01:32:46,971
Don't be afraid.

319
01:32:49,439 --> 01:32:51,146
Don't be afraid.

320
01:32:51,232 --> 01:32:53,394
Hurry up, Johan. Do you hear?

321
01:33:11,252 --> 01:33:13,414
It's just as well you're leaving.

322
01:33:14,798 --> 01:33:16,915
I didn't ask for your opinion.

323
01:34:37,338 --> 01:34:38,749
What's that?

324
01:34:39,507 --> 01:34:41,624
Ester wrote me a letter.

325
01:34:41,718 --> 01:34:43,710
A letter? Let me see.

326
01:34:48,183 --> 01:34:51,267
"To Johan. Words in a foreign language."

327
01:34:54,939 --> 01:34:56,680
Nice of her.
