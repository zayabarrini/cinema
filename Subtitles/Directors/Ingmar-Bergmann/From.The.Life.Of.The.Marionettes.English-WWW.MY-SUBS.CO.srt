00:00:06.715 --> 00:00:14.723
From the Life of the Marionettes

2
00:00:14.973 --> 00:00:16.975
Prologue

3
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.529
l'm tired.

4
00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:39.748
Now you will sleep.

5
00:01:11.988 --> 00:01:13.490
No.

6
00:01:41.643 --> 00:01:43.228
Come.

7
00:03:37.092 --> 00:03:41.054
Twenty hours after the murder,
Mogens Jensen...

8
00:03:41.262 --> 00:03:45.183
professor of psychiatry,
speaks to the head of the inquiry.

9
00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:52.273
l think it was around five. l had
just got up to get the morning paper.

10
00:03:52.524 --> 00:03:56.027
Then the phone rang.
l remember being angry...

11
00:03:56.277 --> 00:03:59.531
for having forgotten
to switch the phone off.

12
00:03:59.781 --> 00:04:05.704
Because patients tend to call me
at all hours of the day and night.

13
00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:13.003
First l ignored it, then l answered
it. l didn't want my wife to wake up.

14
00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:18.883
Peter Egermann was on the phone.
He was very calm...

15
00:04:19.134 --> 00:04:22.804
he sounded in complete control.
He asked me...

16
00:04:23.054 --> 00:04:25.932
to go to a certain address.

17
00:04:26.182 --> 00:04:29.728
He told me to enter the house,
cross the courtyard...

18
00:04:29.894 --> 00:04:33.440
and look for a metal door
to the left of the stairs.

19
00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.278
He said he'd found a key and
that he would open the door for me.

20
00:04:38.486 --> 00:04:43.116
lt took me 20 minutes to get there.
lt was around 5:30.

21
00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.704
l opened that door and
went down to the basement.

22
00:04:47.912 --> 00:04:53.960
All the rooms were brightly lit,
a tape recorder was blasting.

23
00:05:10.852 --> 00:05:14.647
The girl was lying
face down on the table.

24
00:05:14.856 --> 00:05:17.650
She was covered
with a brocaded cloth.

25
00:05:17.859 --> 00:05:20.403
Her legs were spread wide apart.

26
00:05:20.612 --> 00:05:25.909
Her face was covered in blood,
swollen, discoloured.

27
00:05:26.117 --> 00:05:30.747
You'll find all the other
details in the autopsy report.

28
00:05:30.955 --> 00:05:37.337
Egermann said he had killed the girl,
and then had anal sex with her.

29
00:05:39.923 --> 00:05:42.509
To be honest...

30
00:05:42.717 --> 00:05:46.888
l am deeply shocked.
l've known Egermann for 20 years.

31
00:05:47.097 --> 00:05:51.017
He is an amiable, talented,
conscientious man...

32
00:05:51.226 --> 00:05:54.562
whom everyone likes,
as far as l know.

33
00:05:54.771 --> 00:05:58.566
He's happily married
to a hardworking career woman.

34
00:05:58.775 --> 00:06:01.361
He has a large circle of friends...

35
00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:04.656
and leads a comfortable,
rather modest life.

36
00:06:04.906 --> 00:06:08.702
A charming mother...
-Cordelia Egermann, the actress.

37
00:06:08.952 --> 00:06:13.832
His father died a while ago.
His family is wealthy.

38
00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:18.712
His brother is a consul; his sister
is married to a businessman.

39
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:23.133
No hereditary depression in his family?
-Not that l know of.

40
00:06:23.341 --> 00:06:27.178
Peter and Katarina
never consulted with you?

41
00:06:27.429 --> 00:06:31.016
lt was never serious.
Nothing Valium couldn't cure.

42
00:06:31.474 --> 00:06:34.310
Fourteen days
before the catastrophe...

43
00:06:34.477 --> 00:06:39.441
Peter Egermann went to see
Prof. Mogens Jensen at his office.

44
00:06:42.152 --> 00:06:46.489
There've been many long nights
and too much drinking recently.

45
00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:52.245
Besides, l am very aware
of the fact that time is passing.

46
00:06:52.454 --> 00:06:53.997
So...

47
00:06:58.585 --> 00:07:03.340
But l'll stop being evasive.
l'll tell you what's troubling me.

48
00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:08.303
l guess everyone is troubled by
something, don't you think?

49
00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:11.639
But my anxiety
is really quite particular.

50
00:07:11.848 --> 00:07:14.309
That's why l've come to you.

51
00:07:15.477 --> 00:07:20.148
You think l'm long-winded,
that l talk too much. You're right.

52
00:07:20.357 --> 00:07:24.361
Perhaps l just hesitate to tell you
what's troubling me.

53
00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:30.450
As long as l don't express my anxiety
in words, it remains a dream.

54
00:07:30.658 --> 00:07:37.665
Once l've said the words,
my anxiety becomes manifest, a fact.

55
00:07:43.004 --> 00:07:46.007
My desire to kill appalls me.

56
00:07:48.843 --> 00:07:52.889
My desire to kill another
human being appalls me.

57
00:07:53.973 --> 00:07:55.809
lt appalls me.

58
00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:02.691
l want to kill my wife.

59
00:08:04.442 --> 00:08:06.653
l want to kill her.

60
00:08:09.197 --> 00:08:14.160
l've been carrying that idea
around with me for two years.

61
00:08:17.414 --> 00:08:21.668
Katarina has been unfaithful,
and so have l. But no matter.

62
00:08:21.876 --> 00:08:26.172
We're great in bed.
Actually, our sex life is fantastic.

63
00:08:26.381 --> 00:08:31.094
We make love - how should l put it?
Without emotions.

64
00:08:31.344 --> 00:08:36.224
l mean, without having to think
about our feelings for each other.

65
00:08:38.393 --> 00:08:42.689
l'm not used to describing
the complicated state of the soul.

66
00:08:42.897 --> 00:08:47.819
Perhaps l don't need to say that.
l have the feeling you understand.

67
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:54.409
We love our pleasure. Or perhaps
the pleasure the other person feels.

68
00:08:55.869 --> 00:09:00.874
Sex was always best after we had
been unfaithful to each other.

69
00:09:03.043 --> 00:09:06.212
But the word "unfaithful"
is the wrong word.

70
00:09:06.463 --> 00:09:11.051
lt has a negative moral connotation.
And we never...

71
00:09:11.259 --> 00:09:14.637
l guess it's called
"mutual sexual freedom".

72
00:09:16.348 --> 00:09:22.354
Yes, l'm going on and on.
Now you see how helpless l am.

73
00:09:23.855 --> 00:09:26.358
Shrinks are interested in dreams.

74
00:09:26.566 --> 00:09:29.778
Mine are banal, meaningless, dull.

75
00:09:37.327 --> 00:09:43.041
l want you to tell me my hormones are
responsible for my urge to kill her.

76
00:09:44.626 --> 00:09:47.545
Maybe l just want you
to hypnotize me.

77
00:09:47.796 --> 00:09:49.881
That could be one solution.

78
00:09:53.218 --> 00:09:57.055
You're not saying anything.
-Why did you come to see me?

79
00:09:57.263 --> 00:10:00.266
You don't believe in your own agony.

80
00:10:00.517 --> 00:10:04.145
You don't believe
in the existence of the soul.

81
00:10:04.396 --> 00:10:06.981
So why did you come?
-Are you angry?

82
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:12.529
Of course l'm angry. Because you
have so little respect for your fear.

83
00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:16.825
Maybe you should prescribe
something for me.

84
00:10:17.075 --> 00:10:23.331
Just take a long walk. That's
the best thing for depression.

85
00:10:23.581 --> 00:10:28.211
Then drink some coffee, a few
cognacs, and you'll feel good as new.

86
00:10:28.461 --> 00:10:31.715
Thank you, Mogens.
You've been a great help.

87
00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:33.466
Good-bye.

88
00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:43.893
l don't want to.

89
00:10:48.023 --> 00:10:49.524
Sit down.

90
00:10:52.277 --> 00:10:54.946
l think l've made quite an effort.

91
00:10:58.116 --> 00:11:01.619
How often do we say
that we hate someone.

92
00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:06.833
Or that we wish our counterpart
were dead. Or we hit each other.

93
00:11:07.083 --> 00:11:10.962
Humiliate, challenge,
threaten the other.

94
00:11:11.212 --> 00:11:16.217
We spit each other in the face, grip
each other's arms, wrestle, yell.

95
00:11:16.468 --> 00:11:21.681
Finally some blood is shed. One of us
triumphs, the other is destroyed...

96
00:11:21.931 --> 00:11:25.935
and stands by the bathroom door
asking for forgiveness.

97
00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:30.148
That's not dangerous?
-Not dangerous at all.

98
00:11:30.398 --> 00:11:32.817
Everything's like a game...

99
00:11:33.068 --> 00:11:38.615
with often repeated answers, pauses,
tantrums. The exits are rehearsed.

100
00:11:40.367 --> 00:11:43.828
Of course it's fatal
we don't have an audience...

101
00:11:44.079 --> 00:11:47.916
but we usually manage
to overcome that inconvenience.

102
00:11:49.584 --> 00:11:52.962
That's all...
-That's all nothing.

103
00:11:53.213 --> 00:11:56.466
Just part and parcel
of our life together.

104
00:11:56.716 --> 00:11:58.134
l think...

105
00:12:02.347 --> 00:12:04.599
No, that's not true either.

106
00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:09.270
Not true?

107
00:12:09.521 --> 00:12:13.817
Doesn't one crazy theory claim
some fools love fighting...

108
00:12:14.067 --> 00:12:16.945
and humiliating each other?

109
00:12:17.195 --> 00:12:21.533
Don't they say it's
some rarefied form of contact?

110
00:12:21.783 --> 00:12:26.663
l get punched in the face. Hurrah,
we finally had physical contact.

111
00:12:29.749 --> 00:12:32.127
Divorce and all that.

112
00:12:34.045 --> 00:12:36.506
How are you going to kill her?

113
00:12:38.466 --> 00:12:41.511
lt's all quiet in the apartment.

114
00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:44.305
And intense sunlight floods in.

115
00:12:46.683 --> 00:12:52.605
We've been left to our own devices
for several days. Perhaps longer.

116
00:12:52.856 --> 00:12:55.608
We haven't quarreled. All is...

117
00:12:55.859 --> 00:13:00.989
quiet. Maybe it's early morning.
The street is empty.

118
00:13:01.239 --> 00:13:04.200
A feeling of peacefulness
overcomes me.

119
00:13:05.368 --> 00:13:08.038
Everything seems very far away.

120
00:13:08.246 --> 00:13:13.960
l mean, work, everyday life,
voices and appointments.

121
00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:17.172
There's no agitation or fear.

122
00:13:20.508 --> 00:13:24.429
l can see her moving
around in the bathroom...

123
00:13:24.637 --> 00:13:28.516
saturated in the intense,
almost unreal sunlight.

124
00:13:30.143 --> 00:13:32.187
She's combing her hair.

125
00:13:33.313 --> 00:13:36.608
l've always loved to watch my wife.

126
00:13:36.816 --> 00:13:41.446
Even when we hated each other.
Or when she was revoltingly drunk...

127
00:13:41.696 --> 00:13:47.494
sick or just angry.
l've always loved the way she moves.

128
00:13:47.744 --> 00:13:50.955
Her scent, her presence.

129
00:13:52.457 --> 00:13:57.212
She has turned toward the mirror.
She watches me in the mirror.

130
00:13:57.462 --> 00:14:01.675
She is lost in her own thoughts,
but she breathes heavily.

131
00:14:01.925 --> 00:14:05.136
l'm standing behind her,
at an angle...

132
00:14:05.387 --> 00:14:08.390
and l'm holding the razor
in my right hand.

133
00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:13.478
She watches me the whole time.
And now she really sees me.

134
00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:19.734
An imperceptible smile
hovers around her lips.

135
00:14:22.779 --> 00:14:27.117
l can feel her slight agitation,
a slight pulse at her throat.

136
00:14:27.367 --> 00:14:32.038
Did you know that a human body
contains a large amount of blood?

137
00:14:32.288 --> 00:14:38.503
lf you cut the jugular vein, you and
the walls would be covered in blood.

138
00:14:38.753 --> 00:14:41.423
Blood reeks and is sticky.

139
00:14:41.631 --> 00:14:47.095
She wouldn't die right away. lt'd
take a few minutes for her to faint.

140
00:14:47.345 --> 00:14:50.890
Both of you would probably have
a lot of time to think.

141
00:14:51.141 --> 00:14:53.184
Perhaps you'd regret it.

142
00:14:53.393 --> 00:14:59.941
Things would turn out differently.
You wouldn't have your experience...

143
00:15:00.191 --> 00:15:06.906
other than seeing Katarina on the
bathroom mat with a severed throat.

144
00:15:07.157 --> 00:15:10.326
You're being ironic, aren't you?
-No.

145
00:15:11.786 --> 00:15:14.664
l can get you admitted to my clinic.

146
00:15:14.914 --> 00:15:18.460
They'll pump you full of drugs
till you don't care...

147
00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:22.088
if you're Peter Egermann
or the emperor of China.

148
00:15:22.339 --> 00:15:28.094
Don't worry. We're great at
obliterating people's identities.

149
00:15:28.345 --> 00:15:32.932
No more self, no more fear.
Fantastic, isn't it?

150
00:15:34.142 --> 00:15:38.063
l've read the newest techniques
of psychiatry are tough.

151
00:15:38.313 --> 00:15:41.858
l told you that
l'm taking this matter seriously.

152
00:15:42.108 --> 00:15:47.238
l'm keeping you from your work.
-Yes, a bit. l'm expecting someone.

153
00:15:47.489 --> 00:15:53.119
l won't waste any more of your time.
-l'd have time for you on Thursday.

154
00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:55.705
After four.
-You're very kind.

155
00:15:55.914 --> 00:15:58.667
Aren't l?
-Should l tell Katarina...

156
00:15:58.917 --> 00:16:03.463
Goodbye, Peter Egermann.
Take care of yourself.

157
00:16:03.713 --> 00:16:05.548
Bye, Mogens.

158
00:16:07.842 --> 00:16:10.053
And take good care of yourself.

159
00:16:10.303 --> 00:16:14.516
What do you mean by that?
-Your guest is waiting.

160
00:16:14.766 --> 00:16:16.351
Do you know the way out?

161
00:16:18.186 --> 00:16:19.688
Of course.

162
00:16:51.553 --> 00:16:55.265
Mrs Egermann? ls Mrs Egermann in?

163
00:16:55.473 --> 00:16:57.475
Yes, it's very urgent.

164
00:16:58.601 --> 00:17:00.770
Professor Jensen.

165
00:17:01.021 --> 00:17:04.024
Yes, that'd be better. l'll hold.

166
00:17:04.441 --> 00:17:06.776
Katarina?

167
00:17:07.027 --> 00:17:09.279
Peter was just here.

168
00:17:09.529 --> 00:17:12.115
No, he just left.

169
00:17:12.365 --> 00:17:16.369
Could you come here?
l'll leave the door open, OK?

170
00:17:17.996 --> 00:17:19.497
Yes.

171
00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:34.095
Sorry that l'm late. l had to park
farther down the street so that...

172
00:17:34.346 --> 00:17:38.058
Then l ran the last little bit.
lt's really cold out.

173
00:17:39.309 --> 00:17:42.395
How are you?
Let me look at you.

174
00:17:42.645 --> 00:17:47.650
You look very well. Have you got
anything drinkable around here?

175
00:17:49.152 --> 00:17:53.198
How's the fashion show going?
-lt'll be great. You coming?

176
00:17:53.406 --> 00:17:59.412
Fanny's going. l can't. l've got
to stay home and work on a speech.

177
00:17:59.621 --> 00:18:02.207
You're going to Tunisia?
-On Friday.

178
00:18:02.415 --> 00:18:04.250
For how long?
-Six weeks.

179
00:18:04.459 --> 00:18:07.045
Alone?
-Of course.

180
00:18:10.256 --> 00:18:12.592
This wine is wonderful.

181
00:18:12.801 --> 00:18:14.511
What about your wife?

182
00:18:14.719 --> 00:18:18.223
We go on vacation separately.
-So you've told me.

183
00:18:18.473 --> 00:18:20.767
Why don't you join me?
-To Tunisia?

184
00:18:20.975 --> 00:18:23.353
Why not?
-What about Peter?

185
00:18:23.561 --> 00:18:27.190
He'd probably consider it
a practical idea.

186
00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:31.152
Why hasn't a clever man like you
realized that l love Peter?

187
00:18:31.361 --> 00:18:33.905
Haven't you ever...
-Often.

188
00:18:34.114 --> 00:18:38.410
Much too often. But that's different.
-l don't understand.

189
00:18:38.618 --> 00:18:43.081
You don't need to understand.
-But now l'm curious.

190
00:18:43.331 --> 00:18:45.750
l find you attractive.

191
00:18:45.959 --> 00:18:50.213
l think it'd be a lot of fun
to have an affair with you.

192
00:18:51.715 --> 00:18:53.800
But a trip's a different thing.

193
00:18:54.968 --> 00:18:56.678
And now?

194
00:18:56.886 --> 00:19:01.766
l didn't come here to sleep with you,
but to talk about Peter.

195
00:19:01.975 --> 00:19:05.937
Besides, l have my period.
-Those are two poor excuses.

196
00:19:10.025 --> 00:19:13.987
At any rate, we can't stay here.
-We can't stay here.

197
00:19:14.195 --> 00:19:16.072
So what do you suggest?

198
00:19:17.532 --> 00:19:21.161
ln there.
-lt's not the first time, is it?

199
00:19:21.411 --> 00:19:26.332
l'm sworn to professional secrecy.
-Where's the bathroom?

200
00:19:34.674 --> 00:19:36.217
Here you go.

201
00:20:30.105 --> 00:20:32.941
l'm sorry, but l can't go
through with it.

202
00:20:34.734 --> 00:20:38.405
We'd probably have
a lot of fun, but l can't.

203
00:20:39.698 --> 00:20:43.493
Because of Peter?
-Yes, because of Peter.

204
00:20:43.702 --> 00:20:45.370
How touching.

205
00:20:46.287 --> 00:20:50.542
Why the irony?
-l wasn't being ironic. l swear.

206
00:21:01.386 --> 00:21:07.434
Peter wanted to talk to me. He claims
he's obsessed by a certain idea.

207
00:21:07.642 --> 00:21:11.521
Obsessed by an idea?
-A recurring thought.

208
00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:13.398
ls it serious?

209
00:21:13.648 --> 00:21:18.236
People inflate their anxieties.
They're afraid, and the fear...

210
00:21:18.445 --> 00:21:22.532
is worse than their obsessions.
-What kind of obsessions?

211
00:21:22.741 --> 00:21:27.203
Death wishes, suicide, murder,
violent acts, violence.

212
00:21:27.412 --> 00:21:32.751
l'm not sure. He's coming back
on Thursday. l'll find out more then.

213
00:21:32.959 --> 00:21:36.212
Could he...
-l don't think it's that serious.

214
00:21:37.297 --> 00:21:39.049
And what can l do?

215
00:21:40.342 --> 00:21:45.764
Maybe you should go away for a while.
-At the busiest time of the year?

216
00:21:45.972 --> 00:21:50.268
And why should l?
lf Peter's really sick, he needs me.

217
00:21:50.518 --> 00:21:57.359
There's a small but definite
possibility that you could get hurt.

218
00:21:57.567 --> 00:22:00.945
What do you mean? Would Peter...
-Yes.

219
00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:05.825
Did he say that...
-He made allusions to that effect.

220
00:22:08.328 --> 00:22:10.872
That seems totally ridiculous.

221
00:22:11.081 --> 00:22:15.251
So you won't take a trip?
-lmpossible. Please understand.

222
00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:20.423
How about taking in a house guest?
-Peter wouldn't tolerate that.

223
00:22:20.632 --> 00:22:26.054
You have two nephews, don't you?
-A 6 and an 8-year-old? lmpossible.

224
00:22:27.847 --> 00:22:30.183
What if Peter took a trip?
-He's busy.

225
00:22:30.392 --> 00:22:33.853
They're negotiating
some complicated deals.

226
00:22:34.062 --> 00:22:36.773
He can take sick leave
for a few months.

227
00:22:36.981 --> 00:22:39.484
That's totally unrealistic.

228
00:22:39.693 --> 00:22:43.029
Well, then l'm stumped.

229
00:22:45.198 --> 00:22:48.243
l wonder if you're
not more worried...

230
00:22:48.451 --> 00:22:49.911
than you say you are.

231
00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:53.832
Rationally speaking,
the risks are pretty minimal.

232
00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:56.751
Then let's remain rational.

233
00:22:57.002 --> 00:23:01.631
l don't know, Katarina. My damn
intuition won't let go of this.

234
00:23:03.133 --> 00:23:06.011
ls your intuition always right?

235
00:23:06.261 --> 00:23:07.762
l think so.

236
00:23:09.222 --> 00:23:12.225
l also have an intuition.

237
00:23:12.475 --> 00:23:14.978
And what's it telling you?

238
00:23:15.228 --> 00:23:18.273
That consciously or unconsciously...

239
00:23:18.523 --> 00:23:23.361
you are trying to figure out
Peter's and my relationship.

240
00:23:23.611 --> 00:23:27.574
For what reason?
-l don't know.

241
00:23:28.783 --> 00:23:31.870
Maybe it's just the
kind of person you are.

242
00:23:32.954 --> 00:23:38.501
Now l'm flabbergasted.
-l've always been afraid of you.

243
00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:42.213
Surely not only afraid?
-Peter's a part of me.

244
00:23:42.422 --> 00:23:45.008
Don't you understand that?

245
00:23:45.216 --> 00:23:49.137
l carry him inside of me,
no matter where l go.

246
00:23:49.346 --> 00:23:50.722
He's inside of me.

247
00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:54.517
l've never felt like that
with anyone else.

248
00:23:54.726 --> 00:23:58.563
lf we had kids, it'd be different.
He's my child, l'm his.

249
00:23:58.772 --> 00:24:01.441
No, that's not true.

250
00:24:01.649 --> 00:24:05.445
We both don't want
to be clever or mature.

251
00:24:05.653 --> 00:24:09.699
That's why we fight
and hit each other and cry.

252
00:24:09.908 --> 00:24:12.202
We don't want to grow up.

253
00:24:13.912 --> 00:24:17.207
But we share the same
blood circulation.

254
00:24:18.458 --> 00:24:23.254
Our nerves have grown together
in some strange, uncanny way.

255
00:24:24.339 --> 00:24:26.633
Can you understand that?

256
00:24:27.842 --> 00:24:32.555
Whenever Peter's not feeling well,
the same happens to me.

257
00:24:32.764 --> 00:24:37.227
l want to run home to Peter
and hold him and say, "Now...

258
00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:43.983
From now on, l'll understand
everything you say or think...

259
00:24:44.192 --> 00:24:46.194
everything you feel."

260
00:24:48.071 --> 00:24:50.782
l want to hold him fast
until he finds me.

261
00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:55.787
Why the hell don't we see each other,
although we live together...

262
00:24:55.995 --> 00:24:57.706
and know each other well.

263
00:24:58.081 --> 00:25:00.208
A week after the murder...

264
00:25:00.375 --> 00:25:05.755
the head of the police inquiry
has a talk with Peter's mother.

265
00:25:10.593 --> 00:25:12.887
l feel so helpless.

266
00:25:14.014 --> 00:25:15.932
What do you want to know?

267
00:25:16.141 --> 00:25:19.310
l'd be grateful for anything
you can tell me.

268
00:25:23.523 --> 00:25:26.109
Peter was the child
l'd always wanted.

269
00:25:26.317 --> 00:25:28.278
We were so happy.

270
00:25:29.362 --> 00:25:34.576
He had a wonderful childhood. Maybe
it was too sheltered, l don't know.

271
00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:39.956
He was a fearful child.
He was afraid of the dark.

272
00:25:40.165 --> 00:25:43.960
He always wanted the light
in the hall to be left on.

273
00:25:44.169 --> 00:25:49.215
He was afraid of all sorts of things:
dogs, horses, large birds.

274
00:25:49.424 --> 00:25:54.763
His siblings were much more robust.
He was more like me.

275
00:25:55.013 --> 00:26:00.101
l was also a sensitive child.
And somewhat sickly.

276
00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:04.064
l had asthma and would get
sudden allergy attacks.

277
00:26:05.148 --> 00:26:10.653
l remember he used to bite
his fingernails. lt looked awful.

278
00:26:11.988 --> 00:26:16.117
He was very close to his sister
who was three years younger.

279
00:26:16.326 --> 00:26:20.955
They'd play with dolls
and put on puppet shows.

280
00:26:22.332 --> 00:26:27.796
He was a quick learner at school.
He always got the highest grades.

281
00:26:28.004 --> 00:26:31.299
He was much more talented
than his siblings.

282
00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:40.183
When he was twenty,
he met a very nice girl.

283
00:26:40.392 --> 00:26:45.480
They got engaged and planned to get
married after finishing college.

284
00:26:45.689 --> 00:26:50.902
And then he met Katarina
and fell madly in love with her.

285
00:26:51.861 --> 00:26:55.990
Katarina had a lot of control
over him. She had the say.

286
00:26:57.075 --> 00:27:01.913
What Peter's parents
said or thought...

287
00:27:02.122 --> 00:27:04.874
wasn't important anymore.

288
00:27:07.252 --> 00:27:10.714
Maybe that's the way
it's supposed to be.

289
00:27:13.508 --> 00:27:18.221
l don't know anything.
l don't understand anything.

290
00:27:20.807 --> 00:27:23.852
And how could l understand?

291
00:27:28.732 --> 00:27:33.611
l was an actress before l married. l
gave it up to look after my children.

292
00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:39.034
My husband didn't want me to continue
working. And l've never regretted it.

293
00:27:39.242 --> 00:27:45.165
l've had a good and happy life.

294
00:27:47.917 --> 00:27:50.253
Peter came to see me a few days ago.

295
00:27:50.462 --> 00:27:56.468
lt was a brief visit. He had a list
of things that needed to be repaired.

296
00:27:56.676 --> 00:28:02.015
We went through the list together.
He was to speak with the architect.

297
00:28:02.807 --> 00:28:06.644
lt's an old, dilapidated house...

298
00:28:06.853 --> 00:28:09.689
with a somewhat unkept garden.

299
00:28:09.898 --> 00:28:15.403
ln one wing, the roof is so badly
insulated that snow seeps through it.

300
00:28:15.653 --> 00:28:21.201
We talked about all these things.
We were both in a bit of a rush.

301
00:28:21.409 --> 00:28:26.956
l was expecting guests for dinner,
and Peter was going to a conference.

302
00:28:27.165 --> 00:28:32.170
l didn't notice anything unusual.
Peter just said he was a bit tired.

303
00:28:32.379 --> 00:28:36.049
That he'd had a cold.
Katarina was to be in Paris...

304
00:28:36.299 --> 00:28:39.135
till the middle of the week.

305
00:28:39.969 --> 00:28:45.558
We laughed about all those repairs
and the architect's report.

306
00:28:45.809 --> 00:28:51.189
lt was really quite funny. Peter said
that l live in a real rat trap.

307
00:28:51.398 --> 00:28:55.193
But l love my old house.

308
00:28:55.443 --> 00:28:58.738
l'll never move out of it.

309
00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:10.041
Five days before the catastrophe...

310
00:29:10.208 --> 00:29:12.877
Katarina and Peter
spend a sleepless night.

311
00:29:24.139 --> 00:29:31.062
Go ahead and turn on the light if you
want to read. lt won't bother me.

312
00:29:32.147 --> 00:29:35.442
l think l'll just get up for a while.

313
00:29:35.650 --> 00:29:39.863
Shall l make you some hot milk?
-No, thank you.

314
00:29:42.657 --> 00:29:47.328
Shall we turn up the heat?
-Not for me.

315
00:29:53.043 --> 00:29:55.086
How's your cold?

316
00:29:58.923 --> 00:30:03.053
l don't have a sore throat anymore.
-Oh, good.

317
00:31:56.374 --> 00:31:58.293
l can't sleep either.

318
00:31:59.377 --> 00:32:04.215
Probably because of the change
in weather or the full moon.

319
00:32:04.424 --> 00:32:09.721
Or that horrible meal
Oscar insisted on making for us.

320
00:32:09.929 --> 00:32:12.390
What are you drinking?
-Cognac.

321
00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:17.437
l'll have something to drink, too.
-Your awful liqueur is to your left.

322
00:32:17.645 --> 00:32:22.817
Are you nuts? A liqueur at three in
the morning? l'll have some whisky.

323
00:32:23.068 --> 00:32:27.155
That'll relax me. And it's healthy.
-Don't drink so much.

324
00:32:27.364 --> 00:32:32.786
l'll drink as much as l want,
my darling. l never go overboard.

325
00:32:32.994 --> 00:32:36.498
You were pretty
insufferable last night.

326
00:32:36.706 --> 00:32:39.209
Don't l know it.

327
00:32:39.417 --> 00:32:42.962
You'd had too much to drink.
That's why.

328
00:32:43.171 --> 00:32:47.258
l was like that on purpose.
-That's the way it is. On purpose.

329
00:32:47.467 --> 00:32:52.514
l enjoy embarrassing Martin.
-You succeeded wonderfully.

330
00:32:53.848 --> 00:32:57.227
He always tries
to fondle me in secret.

331
00:32:57.435 --> 00:33:02.691
So l get tipsy
and fondle him. Openly.

332
00:33:02.899 --> 00:33:07.112
That's a subtle way of getting back
at someone, little Peter.

333
00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:12.617
You start talking nonsense loudly...
-That's your opinion.

334
00:33:12.867 --> 00:33:15.829
Everyone else thinks
l'm terribly nice.

335
00:33:20.291 --> 00:33:24.921
Screw all those dinner parties.
-We've got five next week.

336
00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:27.716
So you actually enjoy them?
-So do you.

337
00:33:27.924 --> 00:33:29.467
Not anymore.

338
00:33:29.676 --> 00:33:32.762
We're having dinner
at your mom's tomorrow.

339
00:33:32.971 --> 00:33:35.265
That's important.
-Not to me.

340
00:33:35.473 --> 00:33:39.352
lt's a business dinner.
-l don't have time.

341
00:33:39.561 --> 00:33:41.730
Katarina, you promised.

342
00:33:41.938 --> 00:33:45.358
Your business friends
consider it an honour...

343
00:33:45.567 --> 00:33:49.154
to eat that grub
your awful old mother prepares.

344
00:33:49.362 --> 00:33:52.532
And in that rat trap to boot.
lt's incredible.

345
00:33:52.741 --> 00:33:56.745
Mama is a monument.
-She's a rotten old monument...

346
00:33:56.953 --> 00:34:00.915
to your father's
ancient imperium of oppression.

347
00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:08.548
Now Katarina's going to bed. l have
to get up at a quarter to seven.

348
00:34:08.757 --> 00:34:11.801
l'll lie down in the study.

349
00:34:12.052 --> 00:34:16.181
Don't you have tennis tomorrow?
-Harry's arm hurts.

350
00:34:16.389 --> 00:34:19.976
He smokes too much.
-His smoking's beside the point.

351
00:34:20.185 --> 00:34:25.190
Smoking 70 cigarettes a day affects
the circulation and muscle tissue.

352
00:34:25.398 --> 00:34:28.526
Yeah, right.
-lt goes without saying.

353
00:34:28.735 --> 00:34:32.405
lt goes without saying
that it goes without saying.

354
00:34:34.449 --> 00:34:37.786
So you don't want me
to wake you before l go?

355
00:34:37.994 --> 00:34:40.997
When are you going?
-Shortly before eight.

356
00:34:41.206 --> 00:34:45.335
Then wake me shortly before eight.
-Good night, darling.

357
00:34:46.461 --> 00:34:47.796
Good night, dear.

358
00:34:50.590 --> 00:34:52.133
Peter?

359
00:34:55.845 --> 00:34:57.430
Yes?

360
00:34:57.639 --> 00:35:00.600
Can't you tell me
why you're so unhappy?

361
00:35:01.309 --> 00:35:06.898
l'm neither unhappy nor happy.
What a crappy word by the way.

362
00:35:07.107 --> 00:35:10.276
Are you having problems?
-On the contrary.

363
00:35:10.485 --> 00:35:14.447
Business is booming.
lf that's what you mean.

364
00:35:14.698 --> 00:35:17.450
No, that's not what l meant.

365
00:35:20.286 --> 00:35:22.872
There's no way out.

366
00:35:25.417 --> 00:35:28.169
lf you understand what l mean.

367
00:35:28.378 --> 00:35:30.296
No.
-No...

368
00:35:31.381 --> 00:35:35.427
You have to give me an example.
-Surfeit.

369
00:35:35.635 --> 00:35:39.222
Surfeit?
l don't even know what that is.

370
00:35:39.431 --> 00:35:43.518
A typical component of "surfeit"...

371
00:35:43.727 --> 00:35:48.189
is that you feel
unbearably surfeited...

372
00:35:48.398 --> 00:35:53.111
when asked to elucidate the reason
for that state of surfeit.

373
00:35:54.738 --> 00:35:58.950
Now l'll tell you what l actually
didn't intend to tell you.

374
00:35:59.159 --> 00:36:01.244
No, it's nothing special.

375
00:36:02.370 --> 00:36:05.832
Just a feeling.
-OK...

376
00:36:06.416 --> 00:36:09.711
lt happened early yesterday morning.

377
00:36:09.919 --> 00:36:15.550
l was in the bathroom, drying myself
with a freshly washed, rough towel...

378
00:36:15.759 --> 00:36:17.719
that smelled good.

379
00:36:19.888 --> 00:36:24.809
Suddenly l had an insight,
or whatever it's called.

380
00:36:25.894 --> 00:36:30.648
l saw all these familiar things
around me and knew...

381
00:36:30.899 --> 00:36:34.486
that they soon wouldn't
belong to me anymore.

382
00:36:35.695 --> 00:36:38.782
That everything would be
taken away from me.

383
00:36:40.575 --> 00:36:44.412
None of the things around me
would belong to me anymore.

384
00:36:47.082 --> 00:36:51.920
That feeling was gone after a minute
or so, but last night it came back.

385
00:36:52.128 --> 00:36:55.256
l'm tired, Katarina.

386
00:36:57.592 --> 00:37:01.680
Do you think you can go to sleep now?
-l took a Nembutal.

387
00:37:06.601 --> 00:37:09.771
Come. Let's go to bed.

388
00:37:18.822 --> 00:37:22.158
What time is it?
-Almost four.

389
00:37:25.912 --> 00:37:29.457
Now l can hear the transport
trucks on the highway.

390
00:37:48.643 --> 00:37:53.815
We have two alternatives. Either
we carry the investment costs...

391
00:37:54.024 --> 00:37:58.903
raising the license fee in accordance
with the usual interest rate...

392
00:37:59.112 --> 00:38:02.198
while taking the
amortization into account.

393
00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:08.288
Or if the other party
carries the investment costs...

394
00:38:08.496 --> 00:38:11.541
the first alternative
seems preferable.

395
00:38:12.625 --> 00:38:18.590
New paragraph. We agreed on
an amortization period of 7 years.

396
00:38:19.674 --> 00:38:26.890
lt's a long time, but in return all
repairs would be free of charge...

397
00:38:27.098 --> 00:38:32.520
dash, that way we could gradually
exchange all used parts over time...

398
00:38:32.771 --> 00:38:34.731
dash...

399
00:38:34.939 --> 00:38:38.485
which would be advantageous
to us in the long run.

400
00:38:38.693 --> 00:38:40.987
New paragraph.

401
00:38:44.824 --> 00:38:46.409
So, new paragraph.

402
00:38:46.618 --> 00:38:51.790
While choosing between a fixed
license fee per machine per year...

403
00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:56.586
or one based on production volume
with a guaranteed minimum fee...

404
00:38:56.795 --> 00:39:00.048
we agreed on the first alternative.

405
00:39:00.256 --> 00:39:03.593
They obviously think
we'd audit their books...

406
00:39:03.802 --> 00:39:07.555
and find out their actual
production figures...

407
00:39:07.764 --> 00:39:10.975
No, write
when auditing their books...

408
00:39:11.184 --> 00:39:13.645
we'd obtain certain information...

409
00:39:13.853 --> 00:39:20.193
which we would use when setting up
offices in the countries in question.

410
00:39:22.237 --> 00:39:26.282
The problem is that a completely
new point was then raised.

411
00:39:26.491 --> 00:39:31.079
l protested by saying that that point
had been raised much too late.

412
00:39:31.287 --> 00:39:36.251
But in fact, they're right. lt'll
be difficult to dismiss their demand.

413
00:39:37.002 --> 00:39:43.466
New paragraph. They said that, as
they had decided on Alternative 1 ...

414
00:39:43.675 --> 00:39:48.013
the license fee would pay
off the equipment in 7 years.

415
00:39:48.221 --> 00:39:53.768
The first extension of the agreement
covers a period of 7 1/2 years...

416
00:39:53.977 --> 00:39:57.856
a further prolongation
would extend it to 10 years.

417
00:39:58.106 --> 00:40:01.526
As the equipment,
which remains our property...

418
00:40:01.735 --> 00:40:06.448
is amortized at the end
of the first prolongation period...

419
00:40:06.656 --> 00:40:11.911
they are of the opinion the license
fee should be reduced after 7 years.

420
00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:15.957
New paragraph. They are
of course right in the long run.

421
00:40:16.207 --> 00:40:21.838
Which means that we have to tell them
how much the equipment costs.

422
00:40:22.047 --> 00:40:27.302
ln our calculations of the two
alternatives, we assumed correctly...

423
00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:34.476
they would choose Alternative 1 .
So we overstated the costs.

424
00:40:34.726 --> 00:40:36.353
Which means that...

425
00:40:36.561 --> 00:40:41.274
if we are to deduct those costs from
the license fees after 7 years...

426
00:40:41.483 --> 00:40:44.903
our income would be less
than we had calculated.

427
00:40:45.153 --> 00:40:48.907
All board members get a copy,
the archive...

428
00:40:49.115 --> 00:40:53.036
you and l, and the main file.
That'll be all, Mrs Anders.

429
00:40:53.453 --> 00:40:57.207
Would you like some coffee?
-No, thank you.

430
00:40:59.542 --> 00:41:03.421
Can l get off at five tomorrow?
-Of course.

431
00:41:05.465 --> 00:41:07.717
Are you all right?

432
00:41:07.926 --> 00:41:10.637
l'm fine, thank you.

433
00:41:10.845 --> 00:41:14.933
Your mother called.
l told her you were in a meeting.

434
00:41:15.183 --> 00:41:19.187
Excellent.
-She wanted to remind of your date.

435
00:41:51.678 --> 00:41:54.431
Four days before the catastrophe,
Katarina prepares her fashion show.

436
00:41:54.639 --> 00:41:57.934
This is the way l want it.
So change it, Tim.

437
00:41:58.184 --> 00:42:00.478
No problem.
Have you called Milan?

438
00:42:00.687 --> 00:42:04.024
l called Ariadna today.
Have you talked to Paul?

439
00:42:04.232 --> 00:42:07.485
Yes, ten minutes ago.
He's at airport customs.

440
00:42:07.694 --> 00:42:12.699
No one's seen our machine.
-Don't send them any money.

441
00:42:12.907 --> 00:42:18.204
ls it time to go? Did you have to
wait long? lt's total chaos in here.

442
00:42:18.413 --> 00:42:22.167
25 % of the collection
didn't arrive. lmagine that.

443
00:42:22.375 --> 00:42:25.420
You're leaving?
-We've got a lunch date.

444
00:42:25.628 --> 00:42:27.422
We're running late.

445
00:42:27.672 --> 00:42:32.135
l'll be back as soon as possible.
Take care, darling. Let's go.

446
00:42:38.141 --> 00:42:41.227
l need a drink.
-We're late as it is.

447
00:42:41.436 --> 00:42:44.814
l need a drink.
-You'll get one when we get there.

448
00:42:45.023 --> 00:42:48.985
l need a strong drink
to be able to stomach your mother.

449
00:42:49.235 --> 00:42:52.405
Let's go to a bar.
lt'll just take two minutes.

450
00:42:56.826 --> 00:43:00.789
Can l get a refill, Jack?
l bet you're terribly irritated.

451
00:43:01.039 --> 00:43:06.836
l'm terribly irritated.
-lt suits you. Your eyes are darker.

452
00:43:07.045 --> 00:43:08.922
l like you when...
-l'm tired.

453
00:43:09.130 --> 00:43:13.718
You accepted this luncheon date.
-But l asked you first.

454
00:43:13.968 --> 00:43:18.640
No, after you'd already accepted it.
-You know how important it is.

455
00:43:18.848 --> 00:43:24.062
You can get as angry as you like,
but l need another drink. Jack...

456
00:43:24.270 --> 00:43:26.940
Then l'll tell Mama
you had no time.

457
00:43:27.148 --> 00:43:29.317
An excellent idea.

458
00:43:44.416 --> 00:43:47.627
Can l get you anything else?
-No, thank you.

459
00:43:57.971 --> 00:44:02.600
You didn't go to Peter's
mother's luncheon?

460
00:44:02.809 --> 00:44:06.730
How's it going up there?
-We're taking a break till four.

461
00:44:06.938 --> 00:44:11.317
l hope you don't mind.
-l don't mind.

462
00:44:16.823 --> 00:44:20.160
Have you had anything to eat?
-l don't think so.

463
00:44:20.368 --> 00:44:24.456
l have a wonderful idea.
Come to my place for a few hours.

464
00:44:24.706 --> 00:44:28.293
You can take a nice long bath,
and l'll make us a salad.

465
00:44:28.501 --> 00:44:31.212
l'm fine where l am.
-Come on, Katarina.

466
00:44:31.421 --> 00:44:34.049
You need to get out for a bit.

467
00:44:34.883 --> 00:44:37.052
l feel so bad.
-Because of Peter?

468
00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:41.973
That's so stupid, isn't it?
-Come on, Katarina.

469
00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:50.899
Martin was truly a decent person.
We were very attached to each other.

470
00:44:51.066 --> 00:44:57.655
But as you know,
fidelity doesn't exist.

471
00:44:57.906 --> 00:45:00.700
Not true fidelity.

472
00:45:00.950 --> 00:45:04.287
When you're gay,
you can't be faithful.

473
00:45:04.537 --> 00:45:08.708
lt's because of the sad fact
that we can't have any children.

474
00:45:08.958 --> 00:45:13.088
We can't even adopt any.
-Peter and l are also childless.

475
00:45:13.296 --> 00:45:19.427
l've always loved children. l think
l would have been a good mother.

476
00:45:19.636 --> 00:45:22.514
Don't you agree?
-Yes.

477
00:45:23.682 --> 00:45:27.727
Martin fell madly
in love with a schoolboy.

478
00:45:27.977 --> 00:45:33.149
His parents were at the end of their
tether. lt was almost scandalous.

479
00:45:33.358 --> 00:45:40.490
Well, naturally l felt rather
abandoned and mourned my loss.

480
00:45:40.699 --> 00:45:44.869
But l got this apartment
as a consolation prize.

481
00:45:45.078 --> 00:45:48.498
Martin would come here often.

482
00:45:48.707 --> 00:45:53.128
He'd sit in the very armchair
in which you're sitting.

483
00:45:53.336 --> 00:45:56.089
Sometimes he'd cry.

484
00:45:56.297 --> 00:46:00.385
lt was hard. Those were hard times.

485
00:46:02.846 --> 00:46:06.182
That boy turned out
to be a real devil.

486
00:46:07.267 --> 00:46:10.895
But it's a lovely apartment.
lt really is.

487
00:46:11.104 --> 00:46:13.148
lt's very lovely.

488
00:46:16.026 --> 00:46:20.447
lt's nice to be with you.
-How long have we known each other?

489
00:46:20.655 --> 00:46:23.742
For 15 years, Tim.
-Oh, my God.

490
00:46:23.992 --> 00:46:28.413
And we've been working
together for 12 years.

491
00:46:28.621 --> 00:46:32.584
Are you unhappy?
-Do l look unhappy?

492
00:46:32.792 --> 00:46:36.880
You're always so friendly
and hardworking...

493
00:46:37.130 --> 00:46:39.591
and self-possessed.

494
00:46:39.799 --> 00:46:44.012
l suddenly had the feeling
that you were terribly unhappy.

495
00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:48.224
l'm sorry, Katarina.
l didn't mean to embarrass you.

496
00:46:48.433 --> 00:46:52.228
Maybe l want to cry.
-You have to cry if you feel like it.

497
00:46:52.437 --> 00:46:59.444
l don't mind at all. On the contrary.
l'd consider it a gesture of trust.

498
00:47:00.570 --> 00:47:03.073
Most gay men like women.

499
00:47:03.281 --> 00:47:07.869
Not because we're particularly
feminine ourselves. No.

500
00:47:08.119 --> 00:47:13.375
But because we're more
in touch with our feelings.

501
00:47:13.625 --> 00:47:18.338
l didn't come up with that. Martin
said that. But it could be true.

502
00:47:18.588 --> 00:47:23.093
lt's immeasurable grief.
Can you understand that? l've ever...

503
00:47:24.552 --> 00:47:28.807
Maybe it isn't grief at all
but some sort of madness.

504
00:47:29.891 --> 00:47:33.770
People like me have never given
the soul much thought.

505
00:47:33.978 --> 00:47:38.525
Then the soul starts acting up,
and you're helpless. You know?

506
00:47:38.733 --> 00:47:40.694
l understand.

507
00:47:41.611 --> 00:47:47.784
Perhaps a few tears are shed
at first. A strange kind of crying...

508
00:47:49.119 --> 00:47:55.583
which then turns into a terrible
howl of grief and hopelessness.

509
00:47:55.792 --> 00:47:58.670
Then it turns into a blind roar.

510
00:47:59.754 --> 00:48:01.506
A roar, a roar.

511
00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:05.093
Everybody breaks down
once in a while.

512
00:48:06.386 --> 00:48:09.889
l've had a couple
of nervous breakdowns myself.

513
00:48:10.098 --> 00:48:15.311
l'm not sure if l'm sorry
that l broke down. l don't think so.

514
00:48:15.562 --> 00:48:18.314
Love was usually at the root of it.

515
00:48:18.523 --> 00:48:23.403
l'm pathologically addicted to
intimacy. And does intimacy exist?

516
00:48:23.611 --> 00:48:28.158
When l say intimacy,
l mean intimacy.

517
00:48:29.242 --> 00:48:34.205
lt's always the same sad story.
The body itself becomes an obstacle.

518
00:48:34.414 --> 00:48:36.416
Then the soul.

519
00:48:36.624 --> 00:48:43.214
Soon you're in a muddle of hopes,
fantasies and compromises.

520
00:48:43.423 --> 00:48:45.633
My God, l'm so theoretical.

521
00:48:47.719 --> 00:48:50.680
l've got a present for you.
-A present?

522
00:48:50.889 --> 00:48:53.892
Wait. You'll get it in a minute.

523
00:48:54.142 --> 00:48:56.895
Here you go.
-But my dear Katarina...

524
00:48:57.103 --> 00:49:02.525
Actually l brought it for Peter, but
he was bad, so now he won't get it.

525
00:49:02.734 --> 00:49:05.403
lt's lovely.
-l bought it in Milan.

526
00:49:05.653 --> 00:49:09.949
l think it'll look good on you.
l've noticed you wear that color.

527
00:49:10.158 --> 00:49:11.701
You see?

528
00:49:14.537 --> 00:49:18.541
Does it make me look older?
-You don't want to get old?

529
00:49:18.750 --> 00:49:24.547
The wrinkles aren't that bad.
lt's the ugliness that distresses me.

530
00:49:24.756 --> 00:49:30.387
The dry skin that's so rough, even
though l put cream on it every night.

531
00:49:32.222 --> 00:49:37.102
And this deep furrow
around the mouth.

532
00:49:37.310 --> 00:49:41.481
One day l woke up
and looked in the mirror.

533
00:49:41.690 --> 00:49:44.401
And there it was. Quite suddenly.

534
00:49:44.609 --> 00:49:47.654
l had the feeling
l'd had a heart attack.

535
00:49:47.862 --> 00:49:52.075
My neck is still fine. No major
catastrophes around the eyes.

536
00:49:52.283 --> 00:49:56.246
But my hands are a disaster.
l've asked three doctors...

537
00:49:56.454 --> 00:50:03.503
what to do. They could remove these
spots, but not the veins and wrinkles.

538
00:50:05.797 --> 00:50:09.884
l look at my mouth and my hands...

539
00:50:10.093 --> 00:50:13.221
and l don't believe my eyes.

540
00:50:13.471 --> 00:50:18.309
l'm still a child. Or perhaps
l'm not a child anymore after all.

541
00:50:18.518 --> 00:50:22.147
l don't understand
all this business about time.

542
00:50:22.355 --> 00:50:27.527
Some experts say it doesn't exist.
And they're right.

543
00:50:27.736 --> 00:50:32.157
When l close my eyes,
l feel like a ten-year-old.

544
00:50:32.365 --> 00:50:36.703
Even physically.
Then l open my eyes again...

545
00:50:37.996 --> 00:50:40.248
and look in the mirror...

546
00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:44.002
and there l see this old fogey.

547
00:50:45.170 --> 00:50:49.924
A childlike old fogey.
lsn't that weird?

548
00:50:50.133 --> 00:50:53.595
A childlike old fogey. That's all.

549
00:50:55.180 --> 00:50:58.308
No, there's something else.

550
00:51:03.063 --> 00:51:05.148
What is it, Tim?

551
00:51:10.779 --> 00:51:14.282
You turn into this.
-l don't understand.

552
00:51:14.491 --> 00:51:16.951
You just turn into this.

553
00:51:28.338 --> 00:51:31.966
That whole business
about intimacy is just a dream.

554
00:51:39.307 --> 00:51:42.394
Brutality and obscenity.

555
00:51:44.312 --> 00:51:48.692
Sometimes l go to certain places
to pick up these awful men.

556
00:51:48.900 --> 00:51:51.361
You wouldn't believe your eyes.

557
00:51:52.487 --> 00:51:56.116
Pleasure and sexuality
and horror and obscenity.

558
00:51:56.324 --> 00:52:01.663
All rolled into one. That's the
kind of sex life your old fogey has.

559
00:52:01.871 --> 00:52:05.500
You can't exactly
call that tender intimacy.

560
00:52:05.709 --> 00:52:10.422
One day someone will kill me. But
that too is a titillating thought.

561
00:52:12.465 --> 00:52:16.553
Certain powers drive me
that l can't control.

562
00:52:16.761 --> 00:52:21.099
Doctors, lovers...

563
00:52:21.307 --> 00:52:25.937
pills, drugs...

564
00:52:26.146 --> 00:52:30.358
alcohol, work.

565
00:52:31.985 --> 00:52:34.237
Nothing helps.

566
00:52:35.572 --> 00:52:42.662
They're secret powers.
Do they have a name? l don't know.

567
00:52:45.331 --> 00:52:49.961
Maybe it's the aging process itself.
The putrefaction.

568
00:52:50.170 --> 00:52:52.130
l don't know.

569
00:52:52.881 --> 00:52:56.217
l have no control over those powers.

570
00:52:58.511 --> 00:53:02.932
l get closer to the mirror
and look into my face...

571
00:53:03.183 --> 00:53:06.102
that has become so familiar.

572
00:53:06.311 --> 00:53:11.107
And l come to the conclusion
that this blend of flesh and blood...

573
00:53:11.316 --> 00:53:17.280
and nerves and pieces of bone
contains two totally incompatible...

574
00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:22.744
l don't know what to call it.

575
00:53:22.952 --> 00:53:26.456
Two incompatible people.

576
00:53:27.749 --> 00:53:33.421
The dream of intimacy,
of tenderness, common interests...

577
00:53:33.672 --> 00:53:38.218
of the ability to forget yourself
and of all that is alive.

578
00:53:38.426 --> 00:53:44.391
And on the other hand, the violence,
the obscenity, the horror and death.

579
00:53:46.559 --> 00:53:52.941
Sometimes l think they all stem
from one and the same origin.

580
00:53:55.694 --> 00:53:57.529
l don't know.

581
00:53:59.239 --> 00:54:02.325
And how could l know anyway?

582
00:54:05.328 --> 00:54:09.416
Perhaps my dreams were
just a bit too beautiful.

583
00:54:09.666 --> 00:54:12.168
And as a punishment...

584
00:54:13.253 --> 00:54:17.424
Life punishes you
when you least expect it.

585
00:54:17.674 --> 00:54:21.678
When you get your orgasm,
your nose is so deep in shit...

586
00:54:21.886 --> 00:54:24.639
that you almost suffocate.

587
00:54:37.527 --> 00:54:39.237
Look at me.

588
00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:49.039
Do me a favour and hold my hand.

589
00:54:51.166 --> 00:54:54.127
Lay it lightly against your cheek.

590
00:55:00.633 --> 00:55:02.469
Can you feel my hand?

591
00:55:06.848 --> 00:55:09.684
Can you feel that it's me?

592
00:55:10.852 --> 00:55:12.687
That it's me?

593
00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:25.700
Three days after the murder,
the head of inquiry speaks to Tim.

594
00:55:39.089 --> 00:55:42.384
Please state your full name.

595
00:55:42.592 --> 00:55:43.927
Tim. T-l-M.

596
00:55:44.135 --> 00:55:47.972
That's your stage name.
Your initials, or whatever.

597
00:55:48.223 --> 00:55:51.935
We'd like to know your full name.
-My name is Tim.

598
00:55:52.143 --> 00:55:57.315
Everyone in Europe calls me Tim.
-According to my files, your name...

599
00:55:57.565 --> 00:56:02.153
is Tomas lsidor Mandelbaum.
-lf you know my name, why ask?

600
00:56:02.362 --> 00:56:07.992
lt's a routine question. We have
to ask so that there's no mix-up.

601
00:56:08.201 --> 00:56:09.536
That's impossible.

602
00:56:10.245 --> 00:56:15.375
This is an informal conversation.
-Then turn off the tape recorder.

603
00:56:15.583 --> 00:56:19.587
Does it bother you?
-Obviously. Or l wouldn't have asked.

604
00:56:20.255 --> 00:56:23.133
Now it's turned off.
-Thank you very much.

605
00:56:24.426 --> 00:56:27.804
Would you like some coffee?
Wine or a cigarette?

606
00:56:28.013 --> 00:56:31.224
No, thank you.
-Maybe some mineral water? Tea?

607
00:56:31.433 --> 00:56:33.852
We don't have too much to offer you.

608
00:56:34.060 --> 00:56:35.770
No, thank you.

609
00:56:36.521 --> 00:56:41.401
Then let's get started, Mr Tim.
-Fine.

610
00:56:41.651 --> 00:56:46.031
This won't hurt. l promise you.
-l don't believe that either.

611
00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:53.079
l asked to speak with you, because
you're a friend of the family.

612
00:56:53.288 --> 00:56:57.542
l've worked closely with Katarina
for 10 years. No, 12 years.

613
00:56:57.792 --> 00:57:02.088
We've been friends for 10 years.
lnitially we were employees.

614
00:57:02.297 --> 00:57:04.883
You know Peter Egermann?
-Of course.

615
00:57:05.091 --> 00:57:08.219
What was their marriage like?
-Good.

616
00:57:09.387 --> 00:57:12.807
Peter's mother was
of a different opinion.

617
00:57:13.016 --> 00:57:16.478
Now you have two
conflicting opinions.

618
00:57:16.686 --> 00:57:19.189
Did you have an affair with Peter?

619
00:57:20.523 --> 00:57:22.067
No.

620
00:57:23.902 --> 00:57:26.863
You seem hesitant.
-We never had an affair.

621
00:57:27.072 --> 00:57:32.494
We never touched each other. Perhaps
we embraced the way good friends...

622
00:57:32.744 --> 00:57:35.497
embrace.
-Please excuse my bluntness.

623
00:57:35.705 --> 00:57:37.499
l'm used to that.

624
00:57:37.957 --> 00:57:40.960
Did you know the murdered girl?
-Yes.

625
00:57:41.211 --> 00:57:42.504
How well?

626
00:57:42.712 --> 00:57:48.426
We were good friends.
-Why were you friends with a whore?

627
00:57:48.635 --> 00:57:52.138
What kind of question
is that, lnspector?

628
00:57:52.347 --> 00:57:56.267
lt's either malicious,
underhanded or naive.

629
00:57:56.476 --> 00:58:00.689
So l'm answering your question
by saying l don't like it.

630
00:58:00.897 --> 00:58:02.941
l didn't mean to insult you.

631
00:58:03.191 --> 00:58:05.068
l'll try to believe that.

632
00:58:07.112 --> 00:58:08.655
Do you live alone?

633
00:58:09.739 --> 00:58:12.367
Yes, l do. l live alone.

634
00:58:13.410 --> 00:58:16.663
Your girlfriend
introduced you to other men?

635
00:58:16.871 --> 00:58:22.043
On occasion.
-You introduced Peter to Ms Krafft...

636
00:58:22.252 --> 00:58:24.838
or "Ka", as she was called?
-Yes.

637
00:58:25.088 --> 00:58:30.343
How did it happen?
-lt happened one Sunday last fall.

638
00:58:30.593 --> 00:58:33.388
At the train station.
-You were taking a trip?

639
00:58:33.638 --> 00:58:39.769
There are foreign men at the station
who go there to earn a bit of money.

640
00:58:39.978 --> 00:58:44.733
Suddenly l ran into Peter Egermann.
He'd bought some foreign papers...

641
00:58:44.941 --> 00:58:49.779
at the international newsstand.
We had a cup...

642
00:58:49.988 --> 00:58:53.658
of coffee together.
For some reason...

643
00:58:53.867 --> 00:58:56.703
l told him why l was at the station.

644
00:58:56.953 --> 00:59:01.374
Peter was interested somehow.
Suddenly he told me...

645
00:59:01.583 --> 00:59:05.211
that he'd never gone
to a prostitute before.

646
00:59:05.462 --> 00:59:09.632
l recommended Katarina Krafft,
gave him her address...

647
00:59:09.883 --> 00:59:14.137
and promised to talk to her about it.
That's the whole story.

648
00:59:15.263 --> 00:59:20.060
That's the reality. But
actually it's not even half of it.

649
00:59:20.268 --> 00:59:22.729
l was furious at Katarina Egermann.

650
00:59:22.979 --> 00:59:28.943
Fact is, l've always been furious
with her, even though l liked her.

651
00:59:29.152 --> 00:59:33.865
l liked the idea that Peter was
cheating on her with a prostitute.

652
00:59:34.074 --> 00:59:37.243
But that's only part of the truth.

653
00:59:37.452 --> 00:59:43.458
Weak people choose strange paths.
You should know that, lnspector.

654
00:59:43.667 --> 00:59:49.172
lt torments me that l was the one who
introduced the killer to the victim.

655
00:59:49.422 --> 00:59:55.261
Please excuse my dramatic turns of
phrase. l just have a bad conscience.

656
00:59:55.512 --> 00:59:58.890
l blame my homosexuality.

657
00:59:59.140 --> 01:00:01.559
That too is just part of the truth.

658
01:00:01.935 --> 01:00:06.314
This is starting to become
interesting, don't you think?

659
01:00:24.124 --> 01:00:28.712
The truth is of course that
l wanted Peter all to myself.

660
01:00:28.962 --> 01:00:31.965
But that wasn't clear to me.

661
01:00:32.173 --> 01:00:35.218
We were to have a mutual secret.

662
01:00:37.470 --> 01:00:43.435
l slowly wanted to take him away
from his wife and make him mine.

663
01:00:43.643 --> 01:00:47.939
l saw that terrible coldness
in his marriage...

664
01:00:48.148 --> 01:00:53.737
and was somewhat obsessed with
the idea that he would turn to me.

665
01:00:53.987 --> 01:00:57.490
That he would
discover me at long last.

666
01:00:57.699 --> 01:01:03.663
That he would realize
that l secretly loved him.

667
01:01:03.872 --> 01:01:08.543
Emotionally,
Peter was a dying man.

668
01:01:08.793 --> 01:01:12.339
The way one can die of hunger,
thirst or loss of blood.

669
01:01:14.549 --> 01:01:17.052
l knew that l could save him.

670
01:01:18.136 --> 01:01:20.930
And l wished l was
the one he was seeking.

671
01:01:22.015 --> 01:01:24.434
Seeking to be close to me.

672
01:01:31.775 --> 01:01:34.611
l don't think l'm wrong.

673
01:01:34.861 --> 01:01:38.990
People like me have
a feeling for such things.

674
01:01:39.199 --> 01:01:44.120
Perhaps everything
l've told you isn't the truth either.

675
01:01:44.329 --> 01:01:48.249
There are certain clever people
who say we're blind.

676
01:01:48.458 --> 01:01:53.463
That our movements are preordained.
That we've been pledged...

677
01:01:53.672 --> 01:01:56.216
or violated since birth.

678
01:01:58.885 --> 01:02:03.473
But that doesn't make
the slightest difference.

679
01:02:03.682 --> 01:02:05.100
Don't you agree?

680
01:02:05.850 --> 01:02:11.398
Peter Egermann wrote a letter to
Professor Jensen. lt was never sent.

681
01:02:11.564 --> 01:02:13.775
Dear Mogens...

682
01:02:13.983 --> 01:02:18.113
what l'm going to describe
isn't a dream in the usual sense.

683
01:02:18.321 --> 01:02:24.619
Although l experienced this under
the influence of pills and alcohol.

684
01:02:24.828 --> 01:02:28.456
This experience seemed
more real and horrible...

685
01:02:28.707 --> 01:02:35.380
than the banal reality of everyday
life. But that's all trivial.

686
01:02:35.588 --> 01:02:37.924
You can throw this letter away.

687
01:02:38.133 --> 01:02:42.303
l'm not writing to amuse you,
but because l must write.

688
01:02:43.388 --> 01:02:45.849
l dreamed that l was sleeping.

689
01:02:47.892 --> 01:02:50.895
l dreamed that l was dreaming.

690
01:02:53.314 --> 01:02:55.692
lt was very sensual.

691
01:02:56.776 --> 01:03:00.488
l mean, in another respect.
Not only erotic.

692
01:03:01.573 --> 01:03:07.454
But somehow there was a direct
link between my lower body...

693
01:03:08.621 --> 01:03:13.293
and the intense and sweet-smelling
moisture of a woman.

694
01:03:14.502 --> 01:03:16.880
Sweat...

695
01:03:17.088 --> 01:03:19.174
saliva...

696
01:03:19.424 --> 01:03:22.469
the fresh scent of thick hair.

697
01:03:24.929 --> 01:03:32.062
l moved over a glittering, spacious
surface with my eyes closed.

698
01:03:33.938 --> 01:03:36.399
And all was very quiet.

699
01:03:38.985 --> 01:03:41.237
My contentment was complete.

700
01:03:41.446 --> 01:03:46.034
l felt a strange urge
to tell a funny story.

701
01:03:46.242 --> 01:03:48.953
But l couldn't speak.

702
01:03:49.162 --> 01:03:51.414
But that didn't distress me.

703
01:03:51.623 --> 01:03:56.920
The feeling of hovering was closely
connected to my muteness...

704
01:03:57.128 --> 01:04:01.007
and my brain was intensely
focused on my hands...

705
01:04:01.216 --> 01:04:04.427
or rather my fingertips.

706
01:04:07.013 --> 01:04:10.850
There was a little eye
on every finger...

707
01:04:12.602 --> 01:04:19.693
that perceived this glittering
whiteness with twinkling delight.

708
01:04:23.196 --> 01:04:25.490
lt felt good like this.

709
01:04:28.618 --> 01:04:30.870
lt could remain this way.

710
01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:37.293
l thought...

711
01:04:40.088 --> 01:04:46.594
or rather l didn't think at all. lt
flowed like a ribbon across my lips:

712
01:04:47.804 --> 01:04:53.476
"lf you are death,
then l welcome you, dear death.

713
01:04:55.645 --> 01:04:57.981
lf you are life...

714
01:04:59.149 --> 01:05:01.735
then l welcome you, dear life."

715
01:05:05.572 --> 01:05:09.868
l am in a closed room
without windows or doors...

716
01:05:10.076 --> 01:05:12.412
but also without a roof or walls.

717
01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:16.082
Perhaps l'm locked
in a sphere or an ellipse.

718
01:05:16.291 --> 01:05:22.297
l'm not sure. lt didn't occur to me
to examine the contours of the room.

719
01:05:22.505 --> 01:05:28.553
l dreamt that l woke
from a deep slumber.

720
01:05:28.762 --> 01:05:32.974
l was lying on the floor,
which was as soft as a thick carpet.

721
01:05:33.183 --> 01:05:36.436
lt was nice and warm,
and l was content.

722
01:05:38.355 --> 01:05:44.361
Katarina lay beside me.
She was still immobile, fast asleep.

723
01:05:44.611 --> 01:05:48.448
l knew right away
that it was all a dream.

724
01:05:49.157 --> 01:05:53.495
l told myself in a low voice
that l shouldn't be afraid...

725
01:05:53.703 --> 01:05:56.956
that it was dangerous
to become afraid...

726
01:05:57.165 --> 01:06:01.878
to start panicking,
to try to find a way out...

727
01:06:02.087 --> 01:06:06.466
to cry or shout or pound the walls.

728
01:06:07.842 --> 01:06:10.887
l decided to remain calm.

729
01:06:13.098 --> 01:06:16.851
Katarina started waking up slowly.

730
01:06:17.936 --> 01:06:20.188
l tried to talk to her...

731
01:06:22.565 --> 01:06:25.527
but l couldn't reach her.

732
01:06:25.735 --> 01:06:29.322
lt seemed as though
she didn't know l was there.

733
01:06:30.407 --> 01:06:36.788
She was soft and indifferent
in a sexually arousing way.

734
01:06:36.996 --> 01:06:39.582
l wanted to make love to her...

735
01:06:39.791 --> 01:06:43.920
but she eluded me.
l never managed to penetrate her.

736
01:06:45.463 --> 01:06:49.009
She watched me,
her lids half-closed, and smiled.

737
01:06:49.217 --> 01:06:53.972
l fell blind rage. l withdrew
to stop myself from killing her.

738
01:06:54.222 --> 01:06:58.184
The feelings of rage and horror
almost suffocated me.

739
01:06:58.393 --> 01:07:00.562
l told myself to remain calm...

740
01:07:00.770 --> 01:07:03.398
unafraid...

741
01:07:03.606 --> 01:07:06.943
self-possessed, not unpredictable.

742
01:07:09.404 --> 01:07:11.865
Everything went awry.

743
01:08:02.707 --> 01:08:06.461
There was even a moment
of tenderness...

744
01:08:06.711 --> 01:08:09.005
of complete silence.

745
01:08:10.674 --> 01:08:14.427
lt is difficult to describe
that particular moment.

746
01:08:15.970 --> 01:08:18.973
The very air l was in
was transformed.

747
01:08:19.224 --> 01:08:22.977
lt became milder
and easier to breathe.

748
01:08:23.186 --> 01:08:26.606
The grey light vanished...

749
01:08:26.815 --> 01:08:32.320
and was replaced by the soft,
subdued light of dawn...

750
01:08:32.529 --> 01:08:37.534
much like gentle hands
that caressed our sore bodies.

751
01:08:37.742 --> 01:08:43.832
We entered into a sudden
spirituality without reservations.

752
01:08:47.252 --> 01:08:49.754
Then disaster struck.

753
01:08:51.423 --> 01:08:57.095
The most unimaginable,
irrevocable thing had happened.

754
01:08:59.889 --> 01:09:02.600
Katarina was suddenly dead.

755
01:09:03.727 --> 01:09:06.271
l knew l'd killed her
in some cruel...

756
01:09:06.479 --> 01:09:08.606
gruesome way.

757
01:09:09.691 --> 01:09:13.653
l woke up again and
found myself sitting on my bed.

758
01:09:13.862 --> 01:09:18.158
The heavy traffic on the highway
down below had started up.

759
01:09:18.366 --> 01:09:20.326
Everything was as usual.

760
01:09:21.494 --> 01:09:25.331
Katarina slept beside me.
Her breathing was calm.

761
01:09:28.752 --> 01:09:30.837
Can you help me?

762
01:09:33.506 --> 01:09:36.176
Can l be helped?

763
01:09:38.219 --> 01:09:40.889
Can l continue living longer?

764
01:09:42.932 --> 01:09:44.976
Am l really alive?

765
01:09:47.062 --> 01:09:52.776
Or was my dream in effect
the only brief moment of life l had?

766
01:09:54.486 --> 01:09:57.947
Of experienced
and vanquished reality?

767
01:10:07.123 --> 01:10:11.878
Two days before the catastrophe,
Peter threatens to kill himself.

768
01:10:12.253 --> 01:10:17.050
Sorry to bother you so early,
but could l speak to Prof. Jensen?

769
01:10:18.843 --> 01:10:20.970
No, thank you. My apologies.

770
01:10:33.983 --> 01:10:38.863
Thank you for coming. l didn't know
what to do. Can you talk to him?

771
01:10:39.072 --> 01:10:42.701
He's outside on the roof.
-Yes.

772
01:10:56.673 --> 01:11:02.554
lt's respectable to want to jump, but
inhumane to torment his fellow men.

773
01:11:09.477 --> 01:11:13.648
Soon someone will see you
and alert the police.

774
01:11:13.857 --> 01:11:15.650
Are you cold?

775
01:11:17.527 --> 01:11:22.532
Can't l at least get your fur coat?
-That would be very nice of you.

776
01:11:28.747 --> 01:11:33.793
Katarina, where's his fur coat?
-l'll get it for you.

777
01:11:53.688 --> 01:11:56.107
Peter.
-Leave me alone.

778
01:11:58.902 --> 01:12:04.324
Martha sends her regards.
-Poor Martha. We disturbed her.

779
01:12:04.532 --> 01:12:08.995
Not at all. She had an early
operation at the children's clinic.

780
01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:12.165
lsn't she priggish?

781
01:12:14.876 --> 01:12:20.298
Come, sit with me.
-l'm fine on the floor.

782
01:12:22.092 --> 01:12:24.803
We had a drink
with Johann and Marianne.

783
01:12:25.011 --> 01:12:30.266
Then we all went out to that new
ltalian restaurant near the theatre.

784
01:12:31.267 --> 01:12:34.104
We ran into Melkers
and his lady friend.

785
01:12:34.312 --> 01:12:37.524
They insisted that
we go back to their house.

786
01:12:38.608 --> 01:12:41.319
Can l have a cigarette?

787
01:12:41.486 --> 01:12:44.989
Thank you.
-What's that on your neck?

788
01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:47.826
Her necklace broke.
-l see.

789
01:12:48.034 --> 01:12:50.662
l got caught in it,
and then it broke.

790
01:12:50.870 --> 01:12:53.832
Make sure it doesn't get infected.
-Oh...

791
01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:58.712
Katarina says she wants to leave me.
l say, Great. What a godsend.

792
01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:01.756
Then she says
she can't live without me.

793
01:13:01.965 --> 01:13:05.927
l say l can live better without her.
She says l'm impotent.

794
01:13:06.136 --> 01:13:10.432
Our fight started at the restaurant.
-l say l'm only impotent with her.

795
01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:14.936
At first he was funny,
but then he started mimicking me.

796
01:13:15.145 --> 01:13:20.066
lt was awkward, and l started to cry.
-She knows exactly when to cry.

797
01:13:20.275 --> 01:13:23.862
Now l'll tell you why we quarreled.
-Now for the aria.

798
01:13:24.070 --> 01:13:27.449
Shut up, Peter.
You've had your performance.

799
01:13:27.741 --> 01:13:30.618
Peter wanted to fuck
when we came home.

800
01:13:30.827 --> 01:13:34.122
l was tired and hoped
it wouldn't take too long.

801
01:13:34.330 --> 01:13:37.334
But Peter wanted
a long, drawn-out fuck.

802
01:13:37.584 --> 01:13:41.880
And l thought l could
still manage that. l always have.

803
01:13:42.213 --> 01:13:47.469
Then he wanted to screw me from
behind but couldn't get his cock in.

804
01:13:48.762 --> 01:13:51.848
He was probably too drunk.

805
01:13:54.601 --> 01:13:56.603
Then l started...

806
01:13:56.811 --> 01:13:59.439
Then l started to laugh.

807
01:13:59.647 --> 01:14:02.692
Then he lost it
and started shouting at me.

808
01:14:02.901 --> 01:14:08.156
But l couldn't stop laughing.
l couldn't control myself.

809
01:14:09.407 --> 01:14:12.827
Then l said l could go down
on him. He likes that.

810
01:14:13.036 --> 01:14:17.290
He grabbed my necklace and
twisted it. l almost suffocated.

811
01:14:17.499 --> 01:14:21.878
l know how to satisfy you. l know
how to give Katarina an orgasm.

812
01:14:22.087 --> 01:14:25.090
Want to know how?
-Over the past 10 years...

813
01:14:25.298 --> 01:14:28.843
l've probably had
832 orgasms with you.

814
01:14:29.260 --> 01:14:33.848
l faked it 513 times and later went
into the bathroom to masturbate.

815
01:14:34.057 --> 01:14:38.687
True, l had a lousy
little twitch on occasion.

816
01:14:39.813 --> 01:14:45.360
l'm terribly grateful
that Peter Egermann taught me...

817
01:14:45.568 --> 01:14:47.320
how to feel like a woman.

818
01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:55.453
Poor Peter,
l feel so damn sorry for you.

819
01:14:56.621 --> 01:15:01.793
l really feel sorry for you.
-Now comes the story of her loyalty.

820
01:15:02.043 --> 01:15:07.924
Let's amuse him with another story.
-At least your big mouth still works.

821
01:15:08.133 --> 01:15:09.718
He's afraid of silence.

822
01:15:11.636 --> 01:15:16.808
Silence harbours the truth. Her
truth, that is. l don't have a truth.

823
01:15:17.017 --> 01:15:23.606
Fact is, Katarina has a life-long
contract with the objective truth.

824
01:15:23.815 --> 01:15:29.738
Partly because she's a woman. As a
woman, she's entitled to such views.

825
01:15:29.946 --> 01:15:35.952
And partly because she is Katarina,
especially chosen and created by God.

826
01:15:37.787 --> 01:15:41.374
l think l should
lie down for a while.

827
01:15:41.583 --> 01:15:44.461
When is Bauer expecting us?
-At ten.

828
01:15:44.669 --> 01:15:49.466
You can sleep for at least an hour.
Take a hot shower later.

829
01:15:51.092 --> 01:15:54.804
Do you need any help?
-How very kind of you.

830
01:15:55.013 --> 01:15:59.476
l can manage by myself.
Thank you for coming, dear Arthur.

831
01:15:59.684 --> 01:16:04.898
You're a real friend. When l see
you and Katarina together...

832
01:16:05.148 --> 01:16:10.362
l suddenly realize what
an extraordinary couple you'd be.

833
01:16:10.570 --> 01:16:14.783
As Christ said on the cross,
"Mother, look at your son.

834
01:16:15.033 --> 01:16:17.827
Son, look at your mother."

835
01:16:24.209 --> 01:16:27.420
l was a hysterical silly goose.

836
01:16:31.549 --> 01:16:33.551
What are you thinking?

837
01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:39.849
That you're playing that old record:
lt was my fault. Forgive me, darling.

838
01:16:40.100 --> 01:16:42.894
Then you end up smelling like a rose.

839
01:16:43.103 --> 01:16:46.648
lf l think l was hysterical,
shouldn't l say so?

840
01:16:46.856 --> 01:16:48.400
No.

841
01:16:51.236 --> 01:16:53.988
Then what should l do?
-Nothing.

842
01:16:55.532 --> 01:17:00.578
Whatever you say, Peter.

843
01:17:00.787 --> 01:17:04.916
l don't mind your lying here,
but keep your trap shut.

844
01:17:05.166 --> 01:17:09.170
Peter.
-Cut it out. That's pointless.

845
01:17:17.137 --> 01:17:21.307
Couldn't we talk to each other?
-No.

846
01:17:22.392 --> 01:17:25.562
Couldn't we at least give it a try?

847
01:17:25.770 --> 01:17:28.648
We've already tried 100,000 times.

848
01:17:28.857 --> 01:17:33.111
The next time we fight we'll use
whatever we said as a weapon.

849
01:17:34.904 --> 01:17:37.949
Do you remember how hard
we tried at first?

850
01:17:38.158 --> 01:17:40.618
We had capital.

851
01:17:41.786 --> 01:17:44.831
Call it love capital, if you will.

852
01:17:45.081 --> 01:17:49.210
We threw it all away needlessly.
Do you know why?

853
01:17:49.419 --> 01:17:53.590
We accepted the rules
but had no knack for the game.

854
01:17:53.798 --> 01:17:56.092
And then we were betrayed.

855
01:17:56.301 --> 01:17:59.054
Do you know
what scares me the most?

856
01:17:59.262 --> 01:18:06.019
That l can't go to work,
read my paper, eat regular meals.

857
01:18:06.227 --> 01:18:11.066
Not being able to sleep, being
constipated, the car breaking down...

858
01:18:11.274 --> 01:18:14.444
getting sick, having a toothache.

859
01:18:14.652 --> 01:18:19.449
The slightest hitch could ruin my
carefully devised security system.

860
01:18:21.409 --> 01:18:24.579
lf that were true,
you wouldn't drink so much.

861
01:18:24.788 --> 01:18:28.249
l drink to have the courage
to switch off my system.

862
01:18:28.458 --> 01:18:29.876
For what purpose?

863
01:18:31.461 --> 01:18:34.005
To blow myself up.

864
01:18:36.758 --> 01:18:38.176
And what remains?

865
01:18:38.635 --> 01:18:42.013
Mincemeat of sorts.
Of blood and nerves.

866
01:18:44.724 --> 01:18:47.143
And that's supposed to be better?

867
01:18:49.437 --> 01:18:53.483
At least l'd be more like
the reality that encases me.

868
01:19:27.350 --> 01:19:32.647
Three weeks after the catastrophe,
Katarina visits Peter's mother.

869
01:19:33.023 --> 01:19:36.860
l'm all alone in this big house...

870
01:19:37.068 --> 01:19:40.613
and don't feel like
seeing a single person.

871
01:19:40.822 --> 01:19:45.160
l don't even want to go out.
-Why not leave for a few months?

872
01:19:45.368 --> 01:19:48.788
Yes, my sister asked me
to visit her in Paris.

873
01:19:48.997 --> 01:19:50.707
You really should take a trip.

874
01:19:52.917 --> 01:19:56.588
What if Peter asks for me?
-Have you seen him?

875
01:19:57.881 --> 01:20:01.176
No. l can't go there.

876
01:20:01.384 --> 01:20:02.927
Not yet.

877
01:20:06.639 --> 01:20:09.934
l went to see him yesterday.
-Yes?

878
01:20:11.102 --> 01:20:14.105
He doesn't seem to be all there.

879
01:20:14.314 --> 01:20:18.526
Do you think he's in distress?
-No, he's getting injections.

880
01:20:18.735 --> 01:20:22.238
l wish an injection could
catapult me out of this hell.

881
01:20:22.822 --> 01:20:25.367
This truly is hell.

882
01:20:25.575 --> 01:20:28.328
l walk around all day by myself.

883
01:20:28.536 --> 01:20:32.248
l put on my coat
to take a walk in the park...

884
01:20:33.041 --> 01:20:37.671
but l can't go out the door.
l don't know what to do.

885
01:20:38.129 --> 01:20:44.594
Maybe l should go to the doctor,
but the old Jacobi is so senile.

886
01:20:44.803 --> 01:20:49.557
l could ask Prof. Jensen
to get in touch with you.

887
01:20:49.766 --> 01:20:53.728
That might be a good idea.
-l'll call him tomorrow.

888
01:20:55.188 --> 01:20:57.816
l'm so lonely, Katarina.

889
01:20:58.024 --> 01:21:00.193
l can come to see you every day.

890
01:21:01.611 --> 01:21:05.198
You've got enough worries as it is.
-Everyone does.

891
01:21:08.076 --> 01:21:13.456
You think it's all my fault.
You've always been very critical...

892
01:21:13.665 --> 01:21:18.712
of Peter's and my relationship.
-You were critical of our marriage.

893
01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:24.467
l'm his mother, Katarina. l'm
closer to him than any other person.

894
01:21:24.676 --> 01:21:30.181
l gave birth to him and raised him.
He's a part of my life.

895
01:21:30.390 --> 01:21:35.437
You don't have any children. You
don't understand a mother's feelings.

896
01:21:37.814 --> 01:21:39.774
The responsibility...

897
01:21:41.735 --> 01:21:43.194
the guilt...

898
01:21:43.403 --> 01:21:47.240
the shame.
-You're right. l don't understand.

899
01:21:47.782 --> 01:21:52.871
l'm sorry. l didn't mean to hurt you.
-You didn't hurt me.

900
01:21:53.079 --> 01:21:56.708
l feel sorry for you.
-l don't believe that.

901
01:21:56.916 --> 01:22:02.213
l've been here for half an hour. All
you've talked about is your feelings.

902
01:22:02.422 --> 01:22:05.425
Your problems,
your guilt, your shame.

903
01:22:05.633 --> 01:22:11.598
Forgive me, Katarina. l thought you'd
come here so that we could talk.

904
01:22:11.806 --> 01:22:14.225
l thought we could talk...

905
01:22:14.434 --> 01:22:16.102
about our feelings.

906
01:22:18.438 --> 01:22:23.026
l don't know what l thought we'd do.
-l also thought of you.

907
01:22:23.234 --> 01:22:25.820
Every hour of the day
l thought of you.

908
01:22:26.029 --> 01:22:28.031
l am also lonely.

909
01:22:30.367 --> 01:22:31.910
Yes.

910
01:22:32.619 --> 01:22:37.040
Full of astonishment
l look back on our lives...

911
01:22:37.248 --> 01:22:41.002
on our former reality
and think it was all a dream.

912
01:22:42.462 --> 01:22:46.383
lt was a game. Lord knows
what the hell we were doing.

913
01:22:47.801 --> 01:22:51.554
This is true reality,
and it's unbearable.

914
01:22:51.805 --> 01:22:55.517
l talk, answer, think,
put on my clothes...

915
01:22:55.725 --> 01:23:01.606
sleep and eat. lt's a daily
compulsion. A strange, hard surface.

916
01:23:01.815 --> 01:23:05.402
But under that surface, l'm crying.

917
01:23:07.445 --> 01:23:10.281
l'm crying for myself...

918
01:23:11.908 --> 01:23:14.994
because l can no longer be
the way l was.

919
01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:22.168
What was, can never be again.
lt's been destroyed. lt's gone...

920
01:23:22.377 --> 01:23:24.087
like a dream.

921
01:23:26.631 --> 01:23:28.675
l cry for Peter.

922
01:23:31.094 --> 01:23:36.516
l've never been able to put myself
in other people's shoes.

923
01:23:36.725 --> 01:23:43.106
But suddenly l think l know
what Peter is feeling and thinking.

924
01:23:43.314 --> 01:23:48.903
l realize that he's unprotected,
frightened and lonely.

925
01:23:49.112 --> 01:23:51.031
So very lonely.

926
01:23:52.949 --> 01:23:58.079
He has turned away, won't return, no
matter how much we call out to him.

927
01:24:01.541 --> 01:24:04.336
But the worst part of it is...

928
01:24:04.544 --> 01:24:08.089
the horrible part,
one l can barely talk about...

929
01:24:08.298 --> 01:24:14.763
is that poor woman. l tell myself she
was only frightened for a moment...

930
01:24:15.263 --> 01:24:19.142
that she didn't realize
what was happening to her.

931
01:24:20.685 --> 01:24:22.479
That doesn't help.

932
01:24:26.149 --> 01:24:27.650
Doesn't help.

933
01:25:22.122 --> 01:25:25.250
50 minutes before the catastrophe...

934
01:25:25.458 --> 01:25:28.670
Peter goes to see the
prostitute Katarina Krafft.

935
01:26:18.011 --> 01:26:20.388
Good evening.
-Evening.

936
01:26:23.183 --> 01:26:27.354
We're closing up for the night.

937
01:26:27.562 --> 01:26:31.775
Pack up. We're closing.

938
01:26:31.983 --> 01:26:34.069
We're closing up.

939
01:26:39.532 --> 01:26:41.743
Bye.

940
01:26:44.162 --> 01:26:47.082
She's willing to stay till six.
-Thanks.

941
01:26:47.290 --> 01:26:52.128
Actually it's against the rules.
Because of the fire insurance.

942
01:26:53.296 --> 01:26:58.259
But you have be gone by six. The
police always pay us an early visit.

943
01:26:58.468 --> 01:27:04.766
The cops from the night shift
drop by for a quickie and a coffee.

944
01:27:04.974 --> 01:27:09.104
Later in the police report
they call it a "routine visit".

945
01:27:11.564 --> 01:27:14.150
Come in. lt'll just take a minute.

946
01:27:30.750 --> 01:27:32.919
Do you want some wine?

947
01:27:54.691 --> 01:27:58.695
l prefer you with your make-up on.
-Fine.

948
01:27:58.903 --> 01:28:01.573
lf it's not too much trouble.
-Oh, no.

949
01:28:01.781 --> 01:28:04.242
But please no false eyelashes.

950
01:28:04.492 --> 01:28:09.289
Of course.
-lt's pretty stuffy in here, huh?

951
01:28:09.497 --> 01:28:11.624
lt's not that bad.

952
01:28:11.833 --> 01:28:16.880
They forgot to put in ventilation
vents when they renovated the rooms.

953
01:28:17.130 --> 01:28:20.342
So we have to leave
the basement door open.

954
01:28:20.550 --> 01:28:25.555
We get some pretty strange guests.
Won't you take your coat off?

955
01:28:25.764 --> 01:28:29.267
Sorry, l forgot my paper.
l've got to take it home.

956
01:28:29.476 --> 01:28:33.271
l bought it this morning,
and now it's already so late.

957
01:28:33.480 --> 01:28:35.023
Don't forget. By six.

958
01:28:38.193 --> 01:28:40.653
Did you like my act?

959
01:28:42.530 --> 01:28:44.616
Not particularly.

960
01:28:47.952 --> 01:28:51.414
Have you been working here long?
-For three years.

961
01:28:51.623 --> 01:28:55.585
When l came, this place
was still brand-new.

962
01:28:55.794 --> 01:28:59.089
How's the money?
-l can't complain.

963
01:29:02.133 --> 01:29:04.469
Got any more wine?

964
01:29:05.679 --> 01:29:09.849
The bottles are in the
bookcase beside the fridge.

965
01:29:13.895 --> 01:29:15.438
You're strange.

966
01:29:23.405 --> 01:29:27.367
There's something weird about you.

967
01:29:28.785 --> 01:29:32.580
Do you have anything up your sleeve?
-l don't think so.

968
01:29:32.789 --> 01:29:36.209
One of the girls wanted
to stay just in case.

969
01:29:36.418 --> 01:29:40.005
Maybe it was stupid of me
to send her away.

970
01:29:40.213 --> 01:29:41.881
Don't worry.

971
01:29:43.174 --> 01:29:45.719
Something doesn't feel right.

972
01:29:46.970 --> 01:29:49.681
Something's not right.

973
01:29:53.852 --> 01:29:56.855
Are you scared?

974
01:29:57.063 --> 01:30:01.026
A good judge of human nature.
-So now you're being ironic?

975
01:30:01.234 --> 01:30:06.614
l'm always ironic.
lt's a disability of sorts.

976
01:30:06.823 --> 01:30:10.326
Oh, man. l can't take this.

977
01:30:11.953 --> 01:30:15.832
Listen, it's pretty
uncomfortable in here.

978
01:30:16.041 --> 01:30:19.836
Don't you think? We could go
to one of the other rooms.

979
01:30:20.920 --> 01:30:22.547
Come on, let's go.

980
01:30:28.595 --> 01:30:29.929
Sylvia's son is so sweet

981
01:30:32.599 --> 01:30:34.142
Go on.

982
01:30:38.480 --> 01:30:42.859
ls this your room?
-l receive my customers in here.

983
01:30:44.486 --> 01:30:47.989
lt's terribly hot.
Can't we open a window?

984
01:30:48.198 --> 01:30:50.658
There are no windows.

985
01:30:52.243 --> 01:30:56.373
l can't stand it in here.
-We can go up on stage.

986
01:30:57.582 --> 01:31:01.544
There's more room up there.
And it's also quite comfy.

987
01:31:01.753 --> 01:31:03.797
Come on, let's go.

988
01:31:30.824 --> 01:31:33.118
What's your name?
-Ka.

989
01:31:33.326 --> 01:31:37.372
But my real name's Katarina.

990
01:31:37.580 --> 01:31:42.335
You have the same name as my wife.
-Now that's pretty weird.

991
01:31:42.585 --> 01:31:46.047
Were you about to say something?

992
01:31:46.256 --> 01:31:48.883
You misunderstood me just now.

993
01:31:49.092 --> 01:31:53.346
l thought your act was
primitive and rather boring.

994
01:31:53.555 --> 01:31:57.142
On the other hand,
l find you enchanting.

995
01:31:57.350 --> 01:31:59.185
Enchanting.

996
01:32:11.656 --> 01:32:16.870
Sit down over there.
l want to look at you.

997
01:32:22.459 --> 01:32:24.002
Like this?

998
01:32:25.295 --> 01:32:27.130
lt'd be better if you got up.

999
01:32:35.638 --> 01:32:37.140
ls this any better?

1000
01:32:38.058 --> 01:32:39.601
Look at me.

1001
01:32:41.061 --> 01:32:42.604
Well?

1002
01:32:44.147 --> 01:32:47.359
Don't other men ask you
to do worse things?

1003
01:32:47.609 --> 01:32:49.444
This is worse.

1004
01:33:00.914 --> 01:33:02.832
There is no way out.

1005
01:33:24.938 --> 01:33:26.773
Are you leaving?

1006
01:33:31.152 --> 01:33:34.656
There is no way out.
-You're talking nonsense.

1007
01:33:34.864 --> 01:33:36.408
Come on...

1008
01:34:19.909 --> 01:34:23.913
l told you that we have
to keep all the doors locked.

1009
01:34:26.291 --> 01:34:28.293
You have to stay.

1010
01:34:35.008 --> 01:34:37.052
Shall l make some coffee?

1011
01:34:44.684 --> 01:34:48.271
lt's too bright in here.
Can't we turn off the light?

1012
01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:53.234
We complained about it, but
no one listens to us around here.

1013
01:35:00.658 --> 01:35:03.745
What kind of smell is that?
-Smell?

1014
01:35:03.953 --> 01:35:08.750
Yes, l smell something.
-lt always reeks of dust, sweat...

1015
01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.878
perfume, cigarette smoke.

1016
01:35:13.546 --> 01:35:17.967
When the toilet is clogged,
it reeks of shit. What do you smell?

1017
01:35:18.176 --> 01:35:23.181
No idea. Maybe l'm imagining it.
-My sense of smell is shot.

1018
01:35:23.390 --> 01:35:26.059
l don't smell anything anymore.

1019
01:35:29.229 --> 01:35:34.901
When l was a kid, my mother'd take
me to see her parents in Denmark.

1020
01:35:35.110 --> 01:35:39.614
l remember how the seasons smelled.
-The seasons?

1021
01:35:39.823 --> 01:35:43.702
Yes. Winter...

1022
01:35:43.910 --> 01:35:48.748
winter smelled like snow,
coal stoves and wet gloves.

1023
01:35:48.998 --> 01:35:54.129
And summer smelled
like seaweed and anthills.

1024
01:35:54.337 --> 01:35:58.425
Spring smelled like melting ice
and snow in deep ditches...

1025
01:35:58.633 --> 01:36:02.846
budding Easter catkins and rain.

1026
01:36:03.096 --> 01:36:06.558
But the autumn was
the most beautiful of all...

1027
01:36:16.067 --> 01:36:17.986
l wasn't asleep.

1028
01:36:18.445 --> 01:36:22.490
Why don't you take off
that stupid coat of yours?

1029
01:36:22.699 --> 01:36:26.202
lt's pretty warm in here, isn't it?

1030
01:36:26.411 --> 01:36:27.996
Yes.

1031
01:36:53.188 --> 01:36:55.398
l'm tired.

1032
01:36:56.149 --> 01:37:00.528
Four weeks later, the psychiatrist
Prof. Mogens Jensen...

1033
01:37:00.737 --> 01:37:07.702
dictates a preliminary evaluation
late in the night.

1034
01:37:11.623 --> 01:37:16.086
Regarding our patient,
the dominant mother...

1035
01:37:16.294 --> 01:37:22.050
and frequent absences of the father
gave rise to latent homosexuality.

1036
01:37:22.258 --> 01:37:25.303
Peter Egermann
was not aware of this...

1037
01:37:25.512 --> 01:37:28.932
but it had a disruptive effect
on his marriage...

1038
01:37:29.182 --> 01:37:32.811
and on his relationships
with other women.

1039
03:19:55.787 --> 04:57:35.605
-

1040
01:37:39.818 --> 01:37:44.906
toward his dominant mother
found no true outlet...

1041
01:37:45.115 --> 01:37:47.367
in his social surroundings...

1042
01:37:47.575 --> 01:37:51.788
since any emotional outburst
would have been considered...

1043
01:37:51.996 --> 01:37:56.292
almost obscene.

1044
01:37:56.501 --> 01:38:02.132
Consequently, he distanced himself
from his feelings early in life.

1045
01:38:02.340 --> 01:38:05.969
lnstead of being himself,
he adopted attitudes.

1046
01:38:06.219 --> 01:38:11.725
He played the role as dictated
by his education and his milieu.

1047
01:38:12.684 --> 01:38:16.813
Excuse me, professor.
l didn't know you were still here.

1048
01:38:17.022 --> 01:38:20.066
l just need a few more minutes.
Good night.

1049
01:38:30.952 --> 01:38:34.372
A highly developed sense of duty...

1050
01:38:34.581 --> 01:38:38.084
self-discipline
practised since childhood...

1051
01:38:38.293 --> 01:38:42.756
and considerable social success
prevented the patient...

1052
01:38:42.964 --> 01:38:46.676
from giving his feelings free rein.

1053
01:38:47.969 --> 01:38:52.849
He was obviously very attached
to his wife who, like his mother...

1054
01:38:53.058 --> 01:38:58.146
is a possessive
and strong-willed person.

1055
01:39:00.231 --> 01:39:03.735
The inexplicable fear
and the fear of this fear...

1056
01:39:03.943 --> 01:39:08.698
were practised in a closed
social ritualistic pattern...

1057
01:39:08.907 --> 01:39:13.828
in which the consumption
of drugs and alcohol...

1058
01:39:14.037 --> 01:39:18.583
is an acceptable, yes,
even recommended outlet.

1059
01:39:18.792 --> 01:39:23.129
Maybe nothing would have happened
if he'd stayed in his milieu.

1060
01:39:23.380 --> 01:39:29.177
The catastrophe occurs the moment
he has contact with the prostitute.

1061
01:39:29.386 --> 01:39:31.137
All becomes possible.

1062
01:39:31.638 --> 01:39:38.645
Anything could have triggered it.
A word, a gesture, a tone of voice.

1063
01:39:38.853 --> 01:39:45.235
He had an emotional blackout,
during which he killed the girl.

1064
01:39:46.778 --> 01:39:50.198
And in a presumably
ecstatic moment...

1065
01:39:50.407 --> 01:39:54.244
Egermann consummates
the sexual act with the dead girl.

1066
01:39:57.372 --> 01:40:01.001
The emotional avalanche
has now been set free.

1067
01:40:02.544 --> 01:40:07.799
You only possess or have control
over the person you have killed.

1068
01:40:08.008 --> 01:40:12.595
The patient broke all social
and emotional taboos...

1069
01:40:12.846 --> 01:40:16.599
and is now a potential
suicide case himself.

1070
01:40:16.808 --> 01:40:20.770
He is subject to the same
rule that l just enumerated:

1071
01:40:22.063 --> 01:40:27.610
Only he who kills himself
has total control over himself.

1072
01:40:35.744 --> 01:40:37.328
Right after he gets up...

1073
01:40:37.537 --> 01:40:40.498
after breakfast
and making his bed -

1074
01:40:40.707 --> 01:40:45.712
he gets up before the others -
he starts up his chess program.

1075
01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:52.927
He chooses a difficult level on the
computer and plays for several days.

1076
01:40:53.136 --> 01:40:58.016
He is very polite to the staff,
but at the same time very reserved.

1077
01:40:58.224 --> 01:41:04.898
He grooms his body meticulously and
cleans his room at least once a day.

1078
01:41:05.148 --> 01:41:08.276
He treats his bedspread
with special care.

1079
01:41:08.485 --> 01:41:13.907
lt takes him 15 minutes to get it
as flat and smooth as he wants it.

1080
01:41:15.033 --> 01:41:17.869
He doesn't read
any books or newspapers.

1081
01:41:18.078 --> 01:41:22.040
He never listens
to the radio or watches TV.

1082
01:41:22.290 --> 01:41:24.501
He has anxiety attacks...

1083
01:41:24.751 --> 01:41:29.339
but refuses all help.
He rejects our attempts to help him.

1084
01:41:31.591 --> 01:41:36.304
At night, he takes a tattered
old teddy bear to bed with him.

1085
01:41:36.513 --> 01:41:39.140
Probably a childhood memento.
