1
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:44,320
The window that once glowed
with light is now darkened,

2
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:52,370
A sign that my beloved is unwell.

3
00:02:54,790 --> 00:03:01,380
Her sister comes to the window
and tells me:

4
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:08,970
"Your beloved is dead and buried."

5
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:16,980
She always lamented
that she slept alone,

6
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:26,280
Now she sleeps in the arms of Death.

7
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,780
- After you, please.
- No, no sir.

8
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,370
No, Mr. Chaucer, after you, please.

9
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,830
It's nothing, sir.

10
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,250
Nothing! You almost knocked me out!

11
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:17,040
You have a nose like a bludgeon.

12
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm joking. I hope I didn't offend you.

13
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:24,510
Ah, but between a jest and a joke,

14
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,970
many a truth can be told.

15
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,150
...I don't mind at all.

16
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:41,070
I'm so skilled in the art of weaving,

17
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:44,530
I can undo all those bitches
in Ypres and Ghent.

18
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:48,950
In all modesty, I say - shit.
Oh! Beg your pardon.

19
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,370
Anyway, there's no-one
better than me, no-one!

20
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,960
for gathering collections in church,
all modesty aside.

21
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:59,380
And if any woman should try
to challenge me,

22
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:02,340
I'll make her rue the day she was born!

23
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:07,130
I'll eat the darling alive!

24
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,560
I went to Jerusalem,

25
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,190
then Rome, Santiago di Compostella

26
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,440
and also Cologne.

27
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:24,780
I'm no spring chicken,
but I know how to have fun

28
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,860
and how to make people laugh.

29
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:33,660
And then I know all sorts of stories
about young love,

30
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:36,500
I can tell you...

31
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:41,460
Because, my darlings,
I know the old dance of Love!

32
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:57,350
Good folks, here are pardons
brought to you hot from Rome!

33
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,940
A piece of the Virgin's veil!

34
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,440
A scrap of Saint Peter's sail,
from when he used to go boating,

35
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:09,240
before Christ taught him
to walk on water.

36
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,660
Radix malorum est cupiditas.
Cupidity is the root of all evil.

37
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:17,910
Don't be miserly. Come, buy.

38
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,830
Buy, buy...

39
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,500
Nowhere in the Gospels
does it say we should remain virgins.

40
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:30,470
What were the genitals made for?
Not to lie there dormant.

41
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:34,100
And don't tell me
they were made just for pissing!

42
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:38,520
I use them for something
quite different!

43
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,100
Ladies and gentlemen...

44
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,440
Quiet, pay attention!

45
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:45,360
Silence, please.

46
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:51,780
Gentle folks, truly I welcome you

47
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:54,910
from the bottom of my heart.

48
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:56,700
I swear,

49
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:01,080
in all these years,
I never saw a finer company.

50
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,630
You take the path to Canterbury.

51
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:09,970
God be with you and may the holy
blessed martyrs reward you,

52
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:14,930
but experience has taught me
that during such a long journey

53
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,470
you may become dreadfully bored,

54
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,770
so here is some friendly advice.

55
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:27,940
To shorten the way, each of you will
tell a tale on the road to Canterbury.

56
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:31,070
I shall be the judge, and your guide.

57
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:35,570
I'll accompany you at my own expense,
until you reach Canterbury.

58
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:37,910
Agreed?

59
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,800
Listen!

60
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,300
I have decided to marry.

61
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,470
No other life is worth a bean.

62
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:01,560
I'm convinced of it. Marriage is paradise.

63
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:07,110
When a man is old,
he should take a fair young wife

64
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,480
to beget an heir,

65
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,320
and live a life of pleasure.

66
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:19,080
All learned men agree on this.

67
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:23,330
Only a few disagree,
of whom Theophrastus was one.

68
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:27,750
But who gives a damn
if he enjoys telling lies?

69
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:33,670
Arrange for my marriage promptly,
for I do not want to wait.

70
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,340
But I tell you, dear friends,

71
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:39,680
on no account will I take an old wife!

72
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,140
What's right

73
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,640
is old fish and young flesh!

74
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:52,280
I'll have no woman of thirty;
that is but straw and fodder!

75
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:57,030
A woman trained in many schools
is half a scholar,

76
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,370
and I don't like scholars.

77
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,670
Fuck off.

78
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:31,440
What pretty figures, pretty faces!

79
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:37,110
By God, what pretty neighbours!

80
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,160
Now all there is to do is choose.

81
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:43,370
Hey, why not?

82
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,870
Perhaps May?

83
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:55,460
No, no, no, better not.

84
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,380
Or...

85
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:03,890
Yes...

86
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:29,710
Brothers, come quickly!

87
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:36,880
No longer need you search
on foot and horseback,

88
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:40,380
I have made my decision,
and I won't turn back.

89
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:44,050
I have found my mate!

90
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:47,350
The firm foundation of my happiness!

91
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,020
I have chosen May.

92
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:52,150
Make a marriage contract!

93
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:55,020
Publish the banns!

94
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,730
My heart needs peace!

95
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,620
My brother, I feel in my heart

96
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:59,000
profound pity that tonight
I must do harm to her!

97
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:04,130
I fear she will not bear my assaults.

98
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,430
God forbid that I should use

99
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,350
all my might.

100
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:15,850
I wish these guests were gone.

101
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,360
Enough eating,
let the dancing commence!

102
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:30,930
Come on, hurry up.

103
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:35,810
Hurry up, Father.

104
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:40,940
Father, let's get a move on.

105
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,040
Go away, all of you!

106
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,540
Away, out!

107
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:07,510
Alas, now I must trespass
against you, my little wife,

108
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:12,720
and make you suffer
before our moment of pleasure.

109
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:19,810
But remember
that no workman in the world

110
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,980
can do his work quickly and well.

111
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:27,190
We have plenty of time to play.

112
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:32,620
All the time we need...
Yes, my little wife.

113
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:37,250
We have the law of God
and man on our side.

114
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:40,290
I am ready!

115
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,620
I did it!

116
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,750
Dearest May,
I love you with all my heart,

117
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,960
and if you don't make love to me
I will die.

118
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:04,980
Best to rest, it's almost day.

119
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:08,600
I'm a little weary - twice in a night!

120
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:09,920
You'll see, my Columbine,
how fair a garden!

121
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:18,010
Not even the author of "Romance of
the Rose" could describe its beauty.

122
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:25,180
Now summer has come again,
and only in this garden

123
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,890
will I pay you my debt as a husband!

124
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:35,690
No-one but I can enter this garden.

125
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:41,490
No-one holds the key,
no-one but myself alone, understand?

126
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:44,490
I carry it with me always.

127
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:22,610
May, come, undress yourself,
lie beside me...

128
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:04,160
Dear Damian,
I too love you with all my heart.

129
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:08,870
I'll steal the key to the garden
and we can make love.

130
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,550
Help!

131
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:26,930
Help me!

132
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,260
I am blind, you imbeciles!

133
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:32,890
- Fetch a doctor!
- I am blind!

134
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:37,440
May, help me, I am blind.

135
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,490
May, where are you?

136
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:01,420
There you are.

137
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:04,340
Where are you going?

138
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:06,430
I've got you now.

139
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,890
I can't see you,
but I'll never let you go.

140
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:45,050
Everyone out! I don't want anybody!

141
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:50,180
Leave me alone with May. Out!

142
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:54,270
Everybody out I said! Go away!

143
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:59,480
Get out! Get out, everyone.
Everyone!

144
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:05,480
Go away, everyone.
Everyone!

145
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:24,800
Lead me to my garden,
my lovely garden

146
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:27,670
which I shall never see again!

147
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,140
Poor January, led off to be deceived.

148
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:44,270
But I forbid it,
for I shall give him back his sight

149
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,940
so that he can see
his wife's treachery.

150
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:52,740
You can if you wish,
but if you give the old man his sight,

151
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:54,700
I'll give her the power of words.

152
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:57,500
Don't be angry, I give up.

153
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:01,040
But I am a king,
and must keep my word.

154
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:06,210
I am a queen, and like you
I will keep my word.

155
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:09,720
So you must not be angry with me.

156
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:30,110
- Are we there, my love?
- Yes, yes.

157
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:35,830
Come now, lie on the grass,
my sweet little wife.

158
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,370
Body sweeter than wine,
doe-eyed delight...

159
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:44,080
I so long to eat those lovely
mulberries up on the tree!

160
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:49,380
Sweet, fruitful wife, there is no boy
here to climb the tree.

161
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:51,630
And I am old and blind.

162
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,090
Never mind, come over here.

163
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:03,440
Careful, my dear. Do not hurt yourself.

164
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,690
Yes, that's it. Very good.

165
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:11,570
I'd give my very blood to help you.

166
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:23,000
Are the mulberries ripe?

167
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,380
Eat your fill, my child!

168
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:38,600
My eyes! I can see!

169
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,980
Help!

170
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,450
What are you doing, whore?

171
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:57,410
You can see!

172
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:00,450
It's a miracle!

173
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,790
I'm so happy!

174
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,670
I saw you!
That man was taking you!

175
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:17,510
I saw it with my own eyes,
up in that tree!

176
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,550
You are confused, sir!

177
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:22,510
Your eyesight never was good.

178
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:26,770
Jealousy made you see phantoms.

179
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:32,650
Husband, your sight is restored.
Let us thank God for this miracle.

180
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:42,160
Yes, little wife,
let's forget everything.

181
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:46,120
And may the Lord forgive me
if ever I thought ill of you.

182
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:59,840
You are even more beautiful
than I remembered, my sweetest May.

183
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,640
Come.

184
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:31,310
Listen! One moment.

185
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:38,100
Virgin Mary.

186
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:40,690
Behind the market, in the fish alley.

187
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:45,530
No, not the old market,
but at the new one,

188
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:47,700
I found two.

189
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:21,940
My friend, for your wife's sake
I'll cross you out of our black book.

190
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:25,690
Don't tremble like that,
you were lucky this time.

191
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:29,950
I am your friend.
How much did we say?

192
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:33,780
Three, four hundred...
Take it all!

193
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:37,660
Just don't denounce my sin,
for the love of God!

194
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:55,600
You swear by Christ
you haven't a copper coin to give me?

195
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,980
It's the truth, my lord, I swear!

196
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,020
Friend, I'm doing this for your sake.

197
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:05,940
But I am a poor man,
have mercy on me.

198
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:10,200
Ask the judge for mercy;
you're fried, my friend.

199
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,860
Fritters!

200
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:38,120
One moment!

201
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,790
Just a minute, we're coming!

202
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:16,900
Excellent, my friend,
you've done yourself much honour.

203
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,740
I have new tasks for you.

204
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:42,550
Good morning, sir, and good health!

205
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:45,970
Welcome. Do you ride far today?

206
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:49,770
No, nearby - to collect rent.

207
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:53,140
So you're a rent collector? So am I.

208
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,900
But I'm a stranger to this country.

209
00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:00,190
I pray you to be my friend and brother.

210
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:03,660
Why not? On my word of honour.

211
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:06,120
Give me your hand.

212
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:17,290
Let us swear to be brothers
until we die.

213
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,090
I swear.

214
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,180
Brother, where is your district,

215
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:27,260
if some day I should come
and need you?

216
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:30,640
Far away, in the northern country.

217
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:34,520
I hope that soon
you will visit me there.

218
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:42,820
As we're rent collectors, teach me
a trick or two to earn more money.

219
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:48,530
Forget conscience or sin,
speak frankly, brother to brother.

220
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:54,080
My wages are so small,
and I have to manage somehow.

221
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:57,000
So I live by extortion and blackmail.

222
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:01,710
So do I.
Without them I couldn't survive.

223
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:05,300
I know neither pity nor conscience.

224
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:10,560
We are made to be together.
Tell me, brother, what is your name?

225
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,530
Brother, do you really want to know?

226
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:27,360
I am a Devil and my home is Hell.

227
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:31,030
I ride around to earn a living,
just as you do.

228
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:35,210
You cheat without scruples,
just as I do.

229
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:40,170
I will keep you good company
until you forsake me.

230
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:43,300
Even if you are the Devil,
I'll keep our bargain.

231
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:45,760
We're both out for profit.

232
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:48,640
We could share what we make.

233
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:54,270
That is, you can take all that men
want to give you.

234
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:57,560
Agreed. You'll take your part,

235
00:37:57,690 --> 00:38:02,270
while I will take everything
that men want to give me.

236
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:17,410
Here lives an old woman who'd rather
break her neck than part with a penny.

237
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:22,250
I'll get twelve pence off her,
by threatening to summon her to court.

238
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,920
Yet God knows she's not guilty
of the slightest sin.

239
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:29,430
Look at how we do things around here
- and learn.

240
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:38,180
What can I do for you gentlemen?

241
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:42,230
I have a letter here:
on pain of excommunication,

242
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:45,360
you must appear
before the archdeacon tomorrow.

243
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,190
Answer to the court
for certain things...

244
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,320
You know what I mean.

245
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:52,740
Twelve pence,
and you'll be acquitted.

246
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:57,120
Where will I find twelve pence,
in the name of Holy Mary?

247
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,750
In all my life I've never had,
even seen, twelve pence.

248
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:05,380
Have pity on me, I'm poor and old.

249
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:09,670
Pay up, or I'll take your new pitcher
to settle our debt.

250
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:13,430
I paid your fine when you cuckolded
your poor husband.

251
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:17,140
Lies! I've never been summoned
to court in my life!

252
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,770
And I've never been wicked
with my body.

253
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:24,980
May the Devil take your body,
and my pitcher, too!

254
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:28,490
Come now, dear mother.

255
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:34,990
Did you really mean what you said?

256
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:41,080
Yes, the Devil take him alive,
and the pitcher, unless he repents!

257
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:45,500
Repent? No, you old witch,
don't bank on it.

258
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:49,800
I won't repent for what I take
from you, no matter what happens.

259
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:29,960
Brother, don't take it ill.

260
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:35,340
This pitcher and your body
are mine by right.

261
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:39,680
This very night
you shall come with me to Hell.

262
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:45,520
There you shall learn more of our
secrets than a Master of Theology.

263
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:43,240
Notes for a Book of Tales of the
Pilgrims on their way to Canterbury.

264
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:46,080
The Cook's Tale.

265
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,750
Get out, you wretched scoundrel!

266
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:53,130
You've finished scrounging around!

267
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:57,590
Don't show your face here again!

268
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:00,180
You bastard!

269
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,660
Stop there!

270
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,400
I'll get you, ugly thief!

271
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,460
You got the sack?

272
00:46:02,590 --> 00:46:05,380
You're a disgrace to your family!

273
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:09,220
I'm sure your mother had you
by an Italian, not by me!

274
00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:13,100
Go to bed at once!
No dinner for you!

275
00:46:31,530 --> 00:46:34,120
Eat, son.
Don't let your father see you.

276
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:38,540
Be a good boy,
find another job tomorrow.

277
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:40,790
Promise me,
in the name of God.

278
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,970
Master, do you have a job for me?

279
00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:56,930
I do need a boy; I'll try you out.

280
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:06,940
Shine the eggs!

281
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:09,820
Shine them! And be careful!

282
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,130
Good.

283
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,510
What have you done?

284
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:34,470
It's nothing, Master.

285
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:47,110
How can it be?

286
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:55,530
It's a miracle! Let me see.

287
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:04,080
What a pity!

288
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:07,460
What an omelette!

289
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:19,720
I must go out for a moment.

290
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:21,730
That is fine, Master.

291
00:48:21,850 --> 00:48:25,770
Stay here and work.
Serve the customers well.

292
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:37,580
Why not come and play with us?

293
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:48,210
Come on!

294
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:07,860
So, I can join your game?

295
00:49:31,090 --> 00:49:33,340
Scoundrel! You're sacked!

296
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:37,640
Better cast away the rotten apple
before it rots all the rest!

297
00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:40,180
You're right.

298
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,730
Evening.

299
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:41,740
Peterkin, come and meet my wife.

300
00:50:43,950 --> 00:50:45,660
She's a whore.

301
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:45,260
Peterkin the Reveller!

302
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:47,770
I declare you under arrest.

303
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:51,390
You'll be tried in London.

304
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:25,400
Geoffrey Chaucer!

305
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:28,780
Yes, my wife.

306
00:53:51,850 --> 00:53:54,310
Robin, let's go, quick!

307
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:40,480
Alison, if I can't have you now,
my passion for you will kill me.

308
00:54:40,730 --> 00:54:42,610
You're crazy, stop!

309
00:54:43,690 --> 00:54:47,280
Love me, or I swear I'll die!

310
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:51,780
Let go of me, Nicholas,
let go or I'll scream!

311
00:54:53,870 --> 00:54:55,660
Keep your hands off me!

312
00:54:56,250 --> 00:55:00,830
Alison, my love,
I desire not only your body,

313
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:03,340
I love you with all my soul.

314
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:07,210
I'll be your servant, your slave,
if only you'll love me a little.

315
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:10,340
In that case, if you swear it...

316
00:55:10,550 --> 00:55:11,930
I swear!

317
00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:15,430
Then I'll give you my love.

318
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:16,600
When?

319
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:22,940
My husband is jealous.
Guard your secret, or I'm dead.

320
00:55:23,270 --> 00:55:24,820
Then do as I say:

321
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:29,450
Bring me a basket of food for 3 days.
I'll be locked in my room.

322
00:55:29,610 --> 00:55:33,200
Then do just as I tell you.
Don't worry.

323
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:37,080
A student wouldn't be worth much
if he couldn't outwit a carpenter.

324
00:55:38,830 --> 00:55:40,370
Once more!

325
00:55:41,370 --> 00:55:45,880
Eggs, meat, fruit...
Enough food for three days.

326
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:13,740
Make pliable that which is rigid,

327
00:56:19,410 --> 00:56:23,290
For everlasting pleasure.

328
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:53,320
Time to go, Martin.

329
00:56:59,450 --> 00:57:00,990
Am I handsome?

330
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:16,390
Oh, Alison, my love!

331
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:32,650
Master Gervase,
don't you ever do anything but work?

332
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:37,490
At your age, I too liked to give
"incense" to all the parish wives.

333
00:57:42,370 --> 00:57:44,410
Come on, Absalom, here we go!

334
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:26,080
Alison, do you hear Absalom
singing under our window?

335
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:29,580
Yes, John, I hear it all.

336
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,460
Is it that peascod
who serves as a sacristan,

337
00:58:32,630 --> 00:58:37,090
and thinks only of decking himself out
and eyeing females?

338
00:58:38,090 --> 00:58:39,680
The very same.

339
00:58:39,930 --> 00:58:44,930
They say he minds his words
and is squeamish about farting.

340
00:58:46,270 --> 00:58:50,100
Sleep, husband. You must be weary
after your journey to Osney.

341
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:54,360
Listen to Absalom,
gurgling like a nightingale.

342
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:11,330
You're sure you haven't seen
our student all day?

343
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:13,380
Yes, I'm sure.

344
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:16,960
I sent Jill to enquire at the door,
but there was no answer.

345
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:19,550
Robin, let's go and see.

346
00:59:33,650 --> 00:59:35,270
Help us, Saint Frideswide.

347
00:59:35,570 --> 00:59:36,980
He seems made of stone.

348
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:41,150
By Saint Thomas,
I feel sorry for our dear Nicholas.

349
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:46,740
I'll go in and shake him
out of his meditations!

350
00:59:46,910 --> 00:59:48,870
Mark my words!

351
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:54,500
May I come in?

352
00:59:58,050 --> 01:00:03,390
Nicholas! What's the matter?
Look down and think of our Lord.

353
01:00:04,550 --> 01:00:09,220
I'll make the sign of the cross to
protect you from spirits and witches.

354
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:13,690
Jesus Christ and Saint Benedict,
protect this house.

355
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:23,610
Shall the whole world vanish so soon?

356
01:00:23,990 --> 01:00:29,120
By my astrology I have found out
that on Monday next

357
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:33,540
a rain will fall so fierce that
Noah's flood was only half as great.

358
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:38,500
Within an hour, the world will be
submerged and mankind will drown.

359
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:43,840
Alas, my wife!
Will my poor Alison drown?

360
01:00:44,050 --> 01:00:46,300
Is there no remedy?

361
01:00:46,550 --> 01:00:50,520
Yes. Follow my advice and I promise:

362
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:53,890
I shall save her, you and myself!

363
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:56,060
There's no time for weeping!

364
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:58,570
Bring me a large tub.

365
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:01,070
We need one for each of us.

366
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:05,950
See they're big enough to fit us.
And bring food for a day.

367
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:10,540
The rain will stop
and retire the next morning.

368
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:13,870
Send away your servants,
Robin and Jill!

369
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:19,210
When you've found the tubs,
hang them high up, on the ceiling.

370
01:01:20,090 --> 01:01:24,550
Put an axe in each, so we can cut
the ropes when the water comes,

371
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:29,850
and float like lords, safe and sound,
as did Noah and his wife.

372
01:01:30,930 --> 01:01:33,640
You and your wife must keep
well apart,

373
01:01:33,810 --> 01:01:38,110
for woe betide any man
who commits carnal sin this night.

374
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:45,360
Go to work now, and God be with you.

375
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:12,810
Quickly, let's get on board.

376
01:03:00,270 --> 01:03:02,770
That's enough. Now shush!

377
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:24,460
Absalom, come here!

378
01:03:26,050 --> 01:03:30,880
The carpenter
hasn't been seen all day.

379
01:03:31,050 --> 01:03:33,050
Your girl's alone in her bed.

380
01:03:33,350 --> 01:03:34,930
Then I'll run there!

381
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:00,580
Let's go!

382
01:04:08,210 --> 01:04:11,970
- Come, let me undress you.
- No, I'll do it; I want to see you!

383
01:04:12,090 --> 01:04:15,800
- You first!
- I want to see you!

384
01:04:17,010 --> 01:04:19,680
Show it to me!

385
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,790
You lucky devil, Absalom!

386
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:02,640
Alison, it's me, Absalom!

387
01:05:07,650 --> 01:05:09,940
What are you doing, my sweet?

388
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:16,240
Alison, my gentle flower, my fair
little bird, wake up, speak to me!

389
01:05:16,530 --> 01:05:18,070
It's Absalom!

390
01:05:19,580 --> 01:05:22,950
He's tried to win me with many gifts.

391
01:05:23,830 --> 01:05:28,630
Sweet wine, hydromel,
beer perfumed with spices,

392
01:05:29,380 --> 01:05:33,880
the freshest fruit,
wafers hot from the stove...

393
01:05:36,220 --> 01:05:39,350
And as I'm a city girl, money, too!

394
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:45,770
My dear, my thirst for love
is so great,

395
01:05:46,060 --> 01:05:49,690
- I am fluttering like a turtle dove!
- You fool! Go away!

396
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:51,900
I love another man better than you!

397
01:05:52,110 --> 01:05:54,610
True love is always ill-fated.

398
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:59,280
If I cannot hope for more,
give me a kiss at least!

399
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:02,290
If I do, will you leave?

400
01:06:02,540 --> 01:06:04,080
Certainly, my love!

401
01:06:05,790 --> 01:06:08,080
Then get ready, I'm coming!

402
01:06:12,630 --> 01:06:14,260
You'll die laughing!

403
01:06:17,130 --> 01:06:19,430
Quick, the neighbours mustn't see!

404
01:06:21,850 --> 01:06:25,810
I am a lord,
for after this I dare hope for more.

405
01:06:39,450 --> 01:06:44,540
What have you done, Alison?
You'll pay for this!

406
01:06:58,220 --> 01:07:00,720
- Master Gervase!
- Absalom!

407
01:07:02,470 --> 01:07:05,850
Has some pretty girl set you
on your toes?

408
01:07:06,180 --> 01:07:09,770
Lend me that poker from the fire,

409
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:12,440
I'll bring it back at once.

410
01:07:12,730 --> 01:07:17,280
- Take it, but why do you want it?
- Stay calm.

411
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:19,650
I'll tell you tomorrow.

412
01:07:42,140 --> 01:07:45,510
Alison, it's me again, your Absalom!

413
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:48,140
- I'm back, my love!
- What now?

414
01:07:48,350 --> 01:07:49,770
I've brought you a gold ring

415
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:53,060
my mother gave me - it's beautiful!

416
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:55,730
It's yours for another kiss!

417
01:07:55,860 --> 01:07:57,530
It's my turn now.

418
01:08:00,740 --> 01:08:02,450
Leave it to me.

419
01:08:02,820 --> 01:08:06,410
Alison, where are you?
Just one more kiss!

420
01:08:10,460 --> 01:08:13,080
Speak, so I know where you are.

421
01:08:15,170 --> 01:08:16,340
There you are!

422
01:08:18,210 --> 01:08:20,590
Water, for the love of God!

423
01:08:22,010 --> 01:08:25,090
My God, it's Noah's flood!

424
01:08:33,940 --> 01:08:36,270
Husband, come on!

425
01:08:37,230 --> 01:08:39,110
You know what we women are like.

426
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:43,660
We have to talk,
because we're so fickle.

427
01:08:43,780 --> 01:08:46,410
The more you deny it,
the more we want it.

428
01:08:46,780 --> 01:08:48,330
Are you finished?

429
01:08:48,490 --> 01:08:51,580
I can't just lie here
at your beck and call!

430
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:00,000
That's good.

431
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:02,920
Well?

432
01:09:09,930 --> 01:09:13,140
Mary, fetch some water
for your master!

433
01:09:33,580 --> 01:09:35,420
What a lovely arse!

434
01:10:03,190 --> 01:10:04,860
What's happening?

435
01:10:18,670 --> 01:10:20,630
Very nice...

436
01:10:47,990 --> 01:10:49,490
- Bitch!
- My turn...

437
01:11:07,260 --> 01:11:09,180
Ah, my dear neighbour.

438
01:11:09,470 --> 01:11:13,220
This is Master Jenkin, my new boarder.
He's a student at Oxford.

439
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:17,520
- Pleased to meet you.
- The pleasure is all mine.

440
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:21,270
I think I've seen you
somewhere before.

441
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:23,560
Who knows where?

442
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,830
What a fine young stud.

443
01:11:42,330 --> 01:11:46,130
But I too, as all my husbands
have said:

444
01:11:47,340 --> 01:11:53,220
I have the best little pussy
to be found in the city of Bath.

445
01:11:53,930 --> 01:11:56,760
But you are married,
if I am not mistaken.

446
01:11:57,060 --> 01:12:02,060
Modesty aside, I'm never short
of a marriage proposal,

447
01:12:02,270 --> 01:12:03,980
or of similar proposals.

448
01:12:04,110 --> 01:12:06,610
If you want to know,
I think it's silly

449
01:12:06,860 --> 01:12:10,190
if a mouse only has
one hole to hide in.

450
01:12:11,780 --> 01:12:13,570
If you really want to,

451
01:12:13,780 --> 01:12:17,080
I've agreed to go to the procession
with him tomorrow.

452
01:12:44,650 --> 01:12:48,270
Oh, my sweet husband,
beloved husband!

453
01:12:49,650 --> 01:12:52,150
Why are you leaving me?

454
01:12:59,580 --> 01:13:01,700
Never again...

455
01:15:01,450 --> 01:15:03,200
I want to speak to you.

456
01:15:05,790 --> 01:15:07,330
Speak, then.

457
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:11,830
You have bewitched me,
I can't deny it.

458
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:18,840
I dreamt of you all night:

459
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:23,930
You tried to kill me
as I was lying on my back,

460
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:27,430
and my bed was covered in blood.

461
01:15:29,690 --> 01:15:31,690
You have bewitched me.

462
01:15:32,110 --> 01:15:33,810
So, you'll have to marry me.

463
01:15:35,860 --> 01:15:38,650
Marry you? But I'm too young.

464
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:43,570
You see, my poor husband
is croaking his last,

465
01:15:43,700 --> 01:15:49,710
and those who know about such things
agree it's a propitious dream.

466
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:54,840
Because blood means gold.

467
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:33,790
Alice, the hat!

468
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:40,800
How do I look?

469
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:48,350
Let's go!

470
01:16:56,270 --> 01:16:59,110
Jenkin, will you take
this woman here present

471
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:03,240
as your wedded wife by the sacred
rite of our Mother Church?

472
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:07,700
Alice, do you take this man here
present to be your wedded husband

473
01:17:07,830 --> 01:17:10,490
by the sacred rite
of our Mother Church?

474
01:17:17,210 --> 01:17:20,630
And this is for the pee
of my darling,

475
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:24,510
beloved fifth husband.

476
01:17:40,860 --> 01:17:42,360
Jenkin

477
01:17:44,070 --> 01:17:48,240
I hope I won't regret giving you
all the land and rents

478
01:17:48,370 --> 01:17:52,870
left me by four husbands before you?

479
01:18:09,140 --> 01:18:10,890
Everything's in this book.

480
01:18:12,180 --> 01:18:15,730
And what might this "everything" be?
What's in this book?

481
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:18,600
For Saint Jodoca's sake!

482
01:18:20,230 --> 01:18:22,940
It tells of Simplicius Gallus,

483
01:18:23,150 --> 01:18:26,570
who left his wife for all time,

484
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:29,160
because once he caught her

485
01:18:29,450 --> 01:18:31,910
spying from behind a door.

486
01:18:32,870 --> 01:18:37,960
Eve, with her perversity,
has led all men to misery,

487
01:18:38,540 --> 01:18:40,670
and Christ to the Cross.

488
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:44,710
Then Xanthippe!

489
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:49,680
Xanthippe, who poured a piss-pot
over Socrates' head,

490
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:54,970
and the saintly man calmly
wiped himself and said:

491
01:18:56,980 --> 01:19:01,060
"Ere thunder stops,
down comes the rain."

492
01:19:01,860 --> 01:19:03,570
Jenkin.

493
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:10,990
I hate people who dare
tell me my faults,

494
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:14,790
like you think you can!

495
01:19:21,330 --> 01:19:23,790
You swine!

496
01:19:30,550 --> 01:19:35,060
You killed me
so you could enjoy in peace

497
01:19:37,310 --> 01:19:40,520
all my land and my money.

498
01:19:40,850 --> 01:19:45,190
But I forgive you, and before I die,

499
01:19:46,860 --> 01:19:50,400
come here, give me one more kiss.

500
01:19:50,740 --> 01:19:53,320
God curse me for what I've done.

501
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:57,370
Forgive me, I beseech you, my dear.

502
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:00,500
I forgive you.

503
01:20:04,590 --> 01:20:07,380
My nose!

504
01:20:21,770 --> 01:20:24,360
Rector, I'm sorry for this illness

505
01:20:24,610 --> 01:20:29,530
that keeps me in bed
like a newborn babe.

506
01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:33,240
Sadly, taking advantage of this,

507
01:20:33,620 --> 01:20:35,370
Simpkin the miller

508
01:20:35,620 --> 01:20:38,660
will steal more corn than ever.

509
01:20:38,790 --> 01:20:40,500
Sir Rector!

510
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:45,080
Since our Manciple is dying,

511
01:20:45,290 --> 01:20:47,540
or looks as if he's about to,

512
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:51,630
will you give us leave to go
and watch the miller grind our corn?

513
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:57,970
Good, you'd like to take on this task.

514
01:20:58,770 --> 01:21:04,190
We bet the miller won't manage
to cheat us by trickery or by force.

515
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:16,320
Alright. Go, gentle students.

516
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:22,750
It seems to be the only solution.
May the good Lord protect you.

517
01:21:39,890 --> 01:21:43,680
How lovely to gad
about with nothing to do!

518
01:21:43,850 --> 01:21:46,810
Why must we be locked in school?

519
01:21:46,940 --> 01:21:49,650
You'd like a good screw, John?

520
01:21:49,770 --> 01:21:53,150
We're worse than monks,
pricks permanently hard...

521
01:21:53,530 --> 01:21:55,490
Freedom! Freedom!

522
01:22:11,300 --> 01:22:13,380
Simpkin, how goes it?

523
01:22:13,510 --> 01:22:16,340
How are your pretty daughter
and your wife?

524
01:22:16,720 --> 01:22:18,430
Not bad, it seems!

525
01:22:21,430 --> 01:22:25,060
What a lovely surprise:
two students instead of the Manciple.

526
01:22:25,390 --> 01:22:27,190
What brings you here?

527
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:30,020
Our Manciple is likely to die.

528
01:22:30,980 --> 01:22:34,610
So we've come to grind our grain.

529
01:22:34,780 --> 01:22:36,950
What will you do while I grind it?

530
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:40,870
I'll stand by the hopper
and watch the corn go in!

531
01:22:41,030 --> 01:22:45,000
I've never seen
the hopper go to and fro!

532
01:22:45,250 --> 01:22:50,880
Do that, John, and I'll watch
how the meal falls into the trough.

533
01:22:52,050 --> 01:22:55,260
For I'm as poor a miller as John!

534
01:22:56,010 --> 01:23:00,050
Right, lads, get your sack off
the horse and bring it here!

535
01:23:00,390 --> 01:23:03,180
- Who'll carry it?
- Give it to me.

536
01:23:09,230 --> 01:23:11,060
Milling's a great trade, lads!

537
01:23:12,070 --> 01:23:15,530
Make yourself at home, get to work!

538
01:23:18,030 --> 01:23:22,240
Start the sails, we're ready!

539
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:26,540
They think they can't be tricked.

540
01:23:26,790 --> 01:23:28,250
What simpletons!

541
01:23:28,580 --> 01:23:31,460
I'll give them bran for flour,
for all their philosophy!

542
01:23:31,790 --> 01:23:34,340
People who study
aren't always the smartest!

543
01:23:34,670 --> 01:23:37,340
The more they think they're clever,
the more I'll rob them!

544
01:24:37,690 --> 01:24:41,450
There you are, lads, done in a trice!

545
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:43,660
The hopper is amusing!

546
01:24:44,620 --> 01:24:47,780
The working of the trough
is interesting!

547
01:25:00,670 --> 01:25:02,420
Where is the horse?

548
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:06,010
Our rector's horse!
Which way did he go?

549
01:25:06,300 --> 01:25:09,930
He's gone down to the marshes,
fast as the wind.

550
01:25:10,390 --> 01:25:12,480
The damned thing can't escape - come!

551
01:25:13,190 --> 01:25:16,060
Why didn't you put him in the stall?

552
01:25:17,900 --> 01:25:20,070
Wife, we'll fill half their sack
with bran.

553
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:21,650
They don't trust me...

554
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:25,700
See them run! Aren't they having fun!

555
01:25:47,260 --> 01:25:49,510
Dobbin, where are you?

556
01:25:56,440 --> 01:25:59,270
Dobbin, leave the mares alone!

557
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:18,210
You idiot!

558
01:26:44,530 --> 01:26:46,360
Good evening.

559
01:26:46,900 --> 01:26:50,660
You're as weary and wet
as two rain-drenched animals!

560
01:26:50,950 --> 01:26:55,620
We've caught the horse, but we beg
for hospitality, for the love of God.

561
01:26:55,910 --> 01:26:58,250
For the love of God,
and for our money.

562
01:26:58,540 --> 01:27:01,340
Small as it is,
share my humble home.

563
01:27:01,590 --> 01:27:05,210
Maybe with your science you can turn
this small house into a mansion!

564
01:27:10,300 --> 01:27:13,390
Have a drink
with your old friend the miller!

565
01:27:38,370 --> 01:27:43,130
Are you asleep, John?
Did you ever hear such a racket?

566
01:27:43,340 --> 01:27:45,340
What a concert!

567
01:27:45,460 --> 01:27:47,800
The miller's snoring like a horse.

568
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:50,760
You could stick a tail
and horns on him.

569
01:27:50,930 --> 01:27:53,510
Who wants to sleep tonight?

570
01:27:55,470 --> 01:27:59,180
I'll be damned
if I don't hump that wench!

571
01:28:00,100 --> 01:28:02,690
I'm entitled to compensation

572
01:28:02,810 --> 01:28:07,070
for all the grain
that's been stolen from us!

573
01:28:07,490 --> 01:28:11,820
Mind the miller doesn't wake up,
or he'll do for us both.

574
01:28:12,240 --> 01:28:14,490
He's worth no more than a flea!

575
01:28:14,830 --> 01:28:18,830
So you get your own back
with his daughter,

576
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:21,870
while I stay here
like a sack of potatoes?

577
01:28:22,250 --> 01:28:26,550
In Cambridge they'll say
I was a sissy or a fool!

578
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,970
Can you feel anything down here?

579
01:28:33,090 --> 01:28:35,220
What about mine?

580
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:45,610
Dammit, the cradle!

581
01:29:30,940 --> 01:29:33,990
I'm dying for a piss!

582
01:29:41,330 --> 01:29:43,710
Damn that cradle!

583
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:28,500
Where is the cradle?

584
01:30:30,840 --> 01:30:34,010
I nearly got in the wrong bed.

585
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:45,520
Husband, it's long since you did
anything like this. What's happening?

586
01:30:45,890 --> 01:30:47,690
Shut up and get on with it!

587
01:30:48,020 --> 01:30:53,440
Molly, my love,
sweet, darling little pussy.

588
01:30:53,990 --> 01:30:57,320
Well done, husband, keep it up!

589
01:31:12,090 --> 01:31:14,840
Farewell, Molly,
it's dawn and I must go,

590
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:17,840
but I'll always be your student.

591
01:31:18,010 --> 01:31:21,800
Farewell. But before you go,
I must tell you one thing:

592
01:31:22,100 --> 01:31:26,100
when you leave the mill,
just behind the door,

593
01:31:26,230 --> 01:31:29,850
you'll find a loaf made
with your stolen flour.

594
01:31:30,520 --> 01:31:32,690
Go, and God protect you, my love.

595
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:51,120
John!

596
01:31:51,330 --> 01:31:54,170
Wake up, listen to this!

597
01:31:55,550 --> 01:32:00,380
Three times I've screwed
the miller's daughter while you lay low!

598
01:32:00,510 --> 01:32:03,890
You filthy devil, you traitor!
I'll murder you!

599
01:32:04,010 --> 01:32:06,060
Help, John!

600
01:32:11,150 --> 01:32:13,360
They're killing each other!

601
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:28,330
Bye-bye, my love!

602
01:32:28,830 --> 01:32:32,420
John, it's baked with our flour!

603
01:33:40,940 --> 01:33:43,030
Why don't you cut it off?

604
01:33:43,280 --> 01:33:45,320
Bitch!

605
01:33:52,750 --> 01:34:02,880
Come on!

606
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:11,970
Whore!

607
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:31,830
You're on double time.

608
01:34:32,830 --> 01:34:34,870
- Just a minute.
- What?

609
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:37,080
Tell me you are my queen.

610
01:34:37,370 --> 01:34:39,080
I'm your queen.

611
01:34:50,180 --> 01:34:55,600
My sweet love, my little dove,
my sweet little flower.

612
01:35:22,750 --> 01:35:24,840
Saint Paul was right:

613
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:29,010
God shall destroy the meat of
the belly, and the belly of the meat.

614
01:35:30,720 --> 01:35:33,050
Cook, two fried eggs.

615
01:35:46,070 --> 01:35:51,360
Take that, you old bag, sent by
the Devil to light the fires of lust

616
01:35:51,490 --> 01:35:54,120
and fan them with your whores.

617
01:35:54,240 --> 01:35:56,700
Why don't you piss wine?

618
01:35:59,710 --> 01:36:02,630
You'll pay for your sin in eternal hellfire!

619
01:36:03,630 --> 01:36:05,630
Wine is a lecherous thing.

620
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:09,720
Drunkenness is the root of evil.
You drunks!

621
01:36:10,010 --> 01:36:14,720
Your face is putrid, your breath
is rancid and your embrace foul!

622
01:36:14,970 --> 01:36:16,760
Do like Samson!

623
01:36:17,020 --> 01:36:21,060
Read the Bible! Samson
never touched a drop of wine.

624
01:36:21,230 --> 01:36:22,770
Cretin!

625
01:36:22,940 --> 01:36:26,230
Rufus, go and piss
on your whore's head!

626
01:36:30,700 --> 01:36:34,990
Now that I've preached against gluttony,
I'll warn you about gambling.

627
01:36:37,490 --> 01:36:40,910
Gambling is the father of lies
and trickery, my friends,

628
01:36:41,080 --> 01:36:45,540
the father of blasphemy
against Christ.

629
01:36:45,710 --> 01:36:49,920
A prince who gambles
loses his prestige as a ruler.

630
01:36:50,050 --> 01:36:53,050
Make a note of it,
you ignorant fools!

631
01:37:22,540 --> 01:37:24,170
Who's dead?

632
01:37:24,460 --> 01:37:27,380
Go and ask whose corpse it is.

633
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:31,210
No need, sirs, for I know already:

634
01:37:31,340 --> 01:37:33,630
he was an old friend of yours.

635
01:37:33,800 --> 01:37:37,390
He was killed this night,
sitting drunk on a bench.

636
01:37:37,680 --> 01:37:42,060
The thief called Death came
and split his heart with a lance.

637
01:37:42,230 --> 01:37:45,440
He left without a word.
That's all I know.

638
01:37:45,560 --> 01:37:49,190
- It's true.
- This Death, is he so dangerous?

639
01:37:49,320 --> 01:37:51,610
I'll search high and low for him.

640
01:37:51,860 --> 01:37:56,450
Let us call ourselves brothers,
and avenge our friend Rufus.

641
01:37:56,570 --> 01:37:59,700
- We are brothers of the flesh!
- Yes!

642
01:38:03,120 --> 01:38:05,250
Get your knives out!

643
01:38:05,370 --> 01:38:08,420
We must find the man
who killed our friend.

644
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:16,030
God be with you, gentle sirs.

645
01:39:16,490 --> 01:39:19,070
Who are you,
wrapped up like a friar?

646
01:39:19,280 --> 01:39:20,820
Why live to be so old?

647
01:39:21,080 --> 01:39:25,620
Though I have travelled the world over,
and even walked to India,

648
01:39:25,750 --> 01:39:29,040
I can find no-one who will agree

649
01:39:29,170 --> 01:39:32,790
to exchange his youth for my old age.

650
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:37,760
So, poor and wretched,
I roam the world

651
01:39:37,970 --> 01:39:41,220
and morning and night
I beat my staff on the ground,

652
01:39:41,350 --> 01:39:45,140
which holds my mother in its belly,
and I say:

653
01:39:45,270 --> 01:39:50,100
"Dear mother, let me in, when shall
my bones have peace at last?"

654
01:39:50,980 --> 01:39:56,190
"Mother, I'd give all my wealth
to have a shroud to wrap myself in."

655
01:39:56,860 --> 01:39:59,950
But she will not yet grant me
that mercy.

656
01:40:00,570 --> 01:40:04,530
Sirs, do not harm an old man,

657
01:40:04,660 --> 01:40:08,540
as you would not want
to be harmed when you are old.

658
01:40:09,330 --> 01:40:13,500
Let me go,
and God be with you on your way.

659
01:40:13,630 --> 01:40:15,800
I must follow my own.

660
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:18,760
You'll not get off so lightly.

661
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:21,720
Just now you talked of this traitor,
Death.

662
01:40:22,090 --> 01:40:24,640
I bet you're both in league.
Tell us where he is,

663
01:40:24,760 --> 01:40:25,930
or you'll pay for it.

664
01:40:26,140 --> 01:40:28,640
You're plotting with him
to kill the young.

665
01:40:32,020 --> 01:40:35,980
If you really want to find Death,

666
01:40:36,360 --> 01:40:39,280
go down that path down there.

667
01:40:39,450 --> 01:40:45,120
I left the man you seek in the grove,
under a tree.

668
01:40:46,790 --> 01:40:51,330
See that oak?
You should seek for him there.

669
01:40:51,790 --> 01:40:56,540
God be with you,
and make you mend your ways.

670
01:41:26,580 --> 01:41:29,120
From now on we can live as rich men!

671
01:41:29,240 --> 01:41:34,080
But we can't take it away in daylight,
we'd be mistaken for thieves.

672
01:41:34,250 --> 01:41:37,170
One of us must fetch bread and wine.

673
01:41:37,290 --> 01:41:41,420
We'll guard it,
then carry it away tonight.

674
01:41:41,550 --> 01:41:43,170
Dick is the youngest.

675
01:42:41,320 --> 01:42:44,990
Master Apothecary, I need poison
to kill rats and a polecat,

676
01:42:45,110 --> 01:42:48,570
They eat through everything,
God damn them.

677
01:42:48,740 --> 01:42:51,870
I will give you a poison so strong

678
01:42:51,990 --> 01:42:56,330
that anyone who takes
but a speck will die at once.

679
01:43:17,480 --> 01:43:19,560
Bread and three flasks of wine!

680
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:22,610
Hop to it, run!

681
01:43:24,570 --> 01:43:26,650
Hurry, you little bastard!

682
01:43:28,570 --> 01:43:32,030
I'm in a hurry. Get a move on!

683
01:43:34,700 --> 01:43:36,290
Here!

684
01:44:22,750 --> 01:44:24,500
Listen, Johnny.

685
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:26,800
We are sworn brothers.

686
01:44:28,420 --> 01:44:31,260
Two men are stronger than one.

687
01:44:31,390 --> 01:44:35,050
You go to him
as if to struggle in jest.

688
01:44:35,180 --> 01:44:37,100
I'll knife him.

689
01:44:37,430 --> 01:44:40,350
We'll kill him
and split the treasure.

690
01:44:41,310 --> 01:44:43,020
Here's the wine!

691
01:44:43,230 --> 01:44:45,610
About time, too!

692
01:44:52,660 --> 01:44:57,490
Dick, my love, I always said
you were my best friend.

693
01:44:58,750 --> 01:45:01,460
What a lovely arse you have!

694
01:45:10,170 --> 01:45:13,970
Let's eat and drink, then bury him.

695
01:45:16,430 --> 01:45:18,390
Wait!

696
01:46:17,700 --> 01:46:19,370
What delicious cake!

697
01:46:22,290 --> 01:46:24,710
Yes, dear Thomas.

698
01:46:34,380 --> 01:46:36,470
May God reward you,

699
01:46:36,760 --> 01:46:40,390
for here I've had many gifts
and many a good meal.

700
01:46:41,010 --> 01:46:45,390
Brother Tom, I hear you've
given things to other friars, too.

701
01:46:46,520 --> 01:46:50,730
Ah Thomas,
you're ill because you're unfaithful!

702
01:46:50,860 --> 01:46:55,570
You gave oats to that convent,
and chicken and geese to another.

703
01:46:57,780 --> 01:47:01,370
No, Thomas, it's all useless!

704
01:47:01,740 --> 01:47:06,410
What is a treasure worth if you cut it
into many parts? Nothing!

705
01:47:07,420 --> 01:47:11,090
I can only give you what I have,
nothing else.

706
01:47:11,210 --> 01:47:16,090
Tell me, you always say
I am your brother and you love me.

707
01:47:16,220 --> 01:47:17,550
Yes!

708
01:47:17,800 --> 01:47:19,640
Of course!

709
01:47:21,390 --> 01:47:26,270
Since I am dying, I will leave
something for your saintly monastery:

710
01:47:26,390 --> 01:47:28,940
the most precious thing I have.

711
01:47:29,100 --> 01:47:30,650
But you must swear

712
01:47:30,980 --> 01:47:34,230
to share it equally
between each friar.

713
01:47:34,860 --> 01:47:38,110
Well then,
run your hand down my back

714
01:47:38,240 --> 01:47:42,490
you'll find something
I have hidden in my bed.

715
01:47:45,540 --> 01:47:47,910
- Courage!
- Where is it?

716
01:47:49,620 --> 01:47:51,460
Right beneath my arse!

717
01:47:53,500 --> 01:47:55,630
- Is your hand there?
- Yes.

718
01:47:55,760 --> 01:47:57,880
Well then!

719
01:48:16,110 --> 01:48:17,190
What is it?

720
01:48:17,440 --> 01:48:20,320
- You must come with me.
- Where to?

721
01:48:20,780 --> 01:48:22,700
We are going to visit Hell.

722
01:48:23,450 --> 01:48:24,950
But why?

723
01:48:25,200 --> 01:48:27,910
It's been decided by those
who do as they like.

724
01:48:28,250 --> 01:48:31,460
- Ask no more.
- My God.

725
01:48:31,790 --> 01:48:35,420
Close your eyes,
and keep them shut tight!

726
01:48:36,500 --> 01:48:38,460
One, two, three!

727
01:49:13,420 --> 01:49:15,330
Hey, Brother Thomas!

728
01:49:15,630 --> 01:49:20,300
Lift your tail, show him
where you keep friars in Hell!

729
01:50:41,380 --> 01:50:44,380
Here finish the Canterbury Tales,

730
01:50:44,510 --> 01:50:47,720
told for the sole pleasure of telling.
