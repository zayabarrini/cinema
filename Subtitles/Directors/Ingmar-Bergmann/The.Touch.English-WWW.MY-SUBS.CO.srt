1
00:00:22,232 --> 00:00:26,236
DIGITALLY RESTORED IN 2017

2
00:01:18,872 --> 00:01:20,373
Dr. Holm.

3
00:01:20,999 --> 00:01:22,500
Good afternoon, Mrs. Vergerus.

4
00:01:22,584 --> 00:01:24,836
Your mother passed away
about 15 minutes ago.

5
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,505
It was all very peaceful.

6
00:01:33,178 --> 00:01:36,097
- May I go in?
- Yes, of course.

7
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:50,148
What about her personal effects?

8
00:03:51,024 --> 00:03:52,525
We...

9
00:03:54,027 --> 00:03:55,987
We'll fetch them tomorrow.

10
00:03:57,655 --> 00:04:00,658
Thank you for all your help and care.

11
00:04:01,576 --> 00:04:03,703
- Mother was...
- Oh, you're welcome.

12
00:04:03,786 --> 00:04:06,581
But perhaps you'd like to have
the wedding rings now?

13
00:05:46,472 --> 00:05:49,350
- Can I do something for you?
- Turn the light out, please.

14
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:03,698
Please leave me alone.

15
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:06,492
Oh, I'm sorry.

16
00:08:57,413 --> 00:08:59,874
We work in the garden every spare minute.

17
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:02,627
Our garden is actually our pride.

18
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:05,546
Oh, you must come here
in the spring or early summer.

19
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,941
- It's so beautiful then.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.

20
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:10,760
We're both very fond of flowers and trees,
as you can see.

21
00:09:10,843 --> 00:09:11,843
Yes.

22
00:09:11,886 --> 00:09:15,223
And in the winter, we dream about
what we're going to do next summer.

23
00:09:15,306 --> 00:09:16,390
Ah, that's very nice.

24
00:09:16,474 --> 00:09:19,769
Maria is also very interested. She has
a little corner of her own down there...

25
00:09:19,852 --> 00:09:21,732
- Dad! Phone call!
- ...which she takes care of.

26
00:09:21,771 --> 00:09:23,356
Excuse me.

27
00:09:34,075 --> 00:09:36,869
I can see why you like it here,
you and Andreas. It's beautiful.

28
00:09:36,953 --> 00:09:38,579
Yes.

29
00:09:38,663 --> 00:09:41,958
This place was left to Andreas
by his parents.

30
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:46,921
Do you know, we couldn't dream of living
right in town or close to the hospital.

31
00:09:47,463 --> 00:09:51,133
Andreas needs this relaxation.
He works much too hard.

32
00:09:51,217 --> 00:09:52,132
Yeah.

33
00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:53,719
The marriage is a happy one?

34
00:09:55,805 --> 00:09:58,099
It's very happy.

35
00:09:58,182 --> 00:10:00,977
We've been married for 15 years.

36
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:03,145
Then everything in the garden's lovely.

37
00:10:04,772 --> 00:10:07,775
You know, it's very difficult
to talk about that kind of thing,

38
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:10,152
especially when you speak
a foreign language.

39
00:10:10,236 --> 00:10:11,821
Please. I don't mean to be tactless.

40
00:10:12,738 --> 00:10:13,739
No?

41
00:10:14,407 --> 00:10:16,742
There's nothing to worry about.

42
00:10:18,119 --> 00:10:19,870
Here.

43
00:10:19,954 --> 00:10:21,872
- Thank you.
<i>- Sk√•l.</i>

44
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:24,542
Dr. Brun agrees.

45
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,669
I want to tell you something.

46
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:30,089
The first time we met,
you were sitting in the cloakroom...

47
00:10:30,548 --> 00:10:33,843
David, will you please excuse me.
It's a consultation. It's somewhat touchy.

48
00:10:33,926 --> 00:10:36,762
I'll be with you in a second.
Make yourself comfortable.

49
00:10:37,555 --> 00:10:38,764
Yes?

50
00:10:39,223 --> 00:10:44,228
You were sitting in the cloakroom
of the hospital crying.

51
00:10:44,979 --> 00:10:48,441
I suppose it's hardly the thing
to tell you, but I fell in love with you.

52
00:10:48,524 --> 00:10:50,985
Which wineglasses, Mama?

53
00:10:52,278 --> 00:10:54,739
- We're having white wine.
- Where are they?

54
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,826
- Second shelf to the right.
- Okay.

55
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:10,421
I didn't mean for you ever to know.

56
00:11:11,047 --> 00:11:14,800
But as chance or whatever it is has
made us friends, I can't help telling you.

57
00:11:14,884 --> 00:11:17,094
I'm in love with you, Karin.

58
00:11:20,973 --> 00:11:26,187
I don't want you to worry or to be upset
with this confession of mine.

59
00:11:28,356 --> 00:11:31,192
But I'm in love with you,
and I want you to know it.

60
00:11:33,069 --> 00:11:34,653
Please have some more raspberries.

61
00:11:34,737 --> 00:11:37,114
No, no. I couldn't eat anything more.
I'm stuffed.

62
00:11:37,198 --> 00:11:40,326
It was delicious.
I must say Maria is a fantastic cook.

63
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:43,371
Tell us about the sculpture now, please.

64
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:48,334
Well, they stumbled on her while
restoring a church a few miles from here,

65
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:50,252
right near the dig where I'm working.

66
00:11:50,336 --> 00:11:52,088
Eh, what church is it, actually?

67
00:11:52,171 --> 00:11:54,423
The old medieval church of Hammar.
Do you know it?

68
00:11:54,924 --> 00:11:57,301
Hammar, yes, we do. We know it.

69
00:11:58,219 --> 00:12:00,679
At any rate, they were taking a wall down,

70
00:12:00,763 --> 00:12:03,516
and about halfway through
discovered a cavity in it.

71
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:07,228
So they proceeded very carefully
to continue taking the wall down.

72
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:10,689
Shall we have coffee in there?
Would you like?

73
00:12:14,485 --> 00:12:17,363
Suddenly,
there in the darkness of the cavity,

74
00:12:17,446 --> 00:12:19,907
they began to faintly see something.

75
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,617
A woman's face.

76
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:26,247
A magnificent, well-preserved wooden
sculpture representing the Holy Virgin.

77
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:29,792
Now as far as we know,
this is something extremely rare.

78
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:33,087
But the curious thing is,
how did it come to your country?

79
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:36,048
How did it get to this remote church?

80
00:12:36,132 --> 00:12:37,883
- Would you like some whiskey?
- Please.

81
00:12:37,967 --> 00:12:40,094
- Some ice with it?
- No.

82
00:12:42,513 --> 00:12:44,390
And here is... This is, uh...

83
00:12:44,473 --> 00:12:46,725
One day, Anders fell overboard.

84
00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:49,019
He's soaking wet.
It doesn't show really, but...

85
00:12:49,103 --> 00:12:51,147
Um, I think there is another...

86
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:53,023
No. This is not it either...

87
00:12:53,107 --> 00:12:56,444
I have a beautiful orchid somewhere, uh,
which is called...

88
00:12:57,194 --> 00:13:00,030
No. No. Who has been using these slides?

89
00:13:00,489 --> 00:13:01,699
Oh, this is it!

90
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:04,118
Oh, this is one of my favorites.
It's an orchid.

91
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:06,328
It's called <i>Ophrys insectifera.</i>

92
00:13:06,412 --> 00:13:10,583
Um, eh, because it looks like an insect,
like a fly.

93
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:13,752
- Uh, it attracts the interest of the fly.
- Andreas.

94
00:13:13,836 --> 00:13:16,005
Andreas,
are you sure David is interested in...

95
00:13:16,088 --> 00:13:19,758
Oh, no. No, no.
I am enjoying these slides, Andreas.

96
00:13:19,842 --> 00:13:22,845
I am fascinated by the flowers.
They're wonderful.

97
00:13:22,928 --> 00:13:23,971
Well-Well, uh...

98
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:26,682
Well, there are a few other pictures.
I think this...

99
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:28,851
No. Well, this is a donkey.

100
00:13:28,934 --> 00:13:31,979
It's, uh... It's Anders's donkey.
It's called Johnny.

101
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:34,732
It-It died after two weeks.

102
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:37,318
Uh, and this is my mother-in-law.

103
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:41,071
Uh, she's also... dead.
Uh, they're... Oh, this!

104
00:13:41,155 --> 00:13:44,909
- Haven't you a picture of your wife nude?
- In the nude?

105
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:47,870
I would like to see
a picture of Karin nude.

106
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:49,580
No. I...

107
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:52,333
I'm sorry, David.
I have to disappoint you there.

108
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:54,543
You'll have to content yourself
with my orchids.

109
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:02,676
- I'll drive you home, David.
- No, no, no, no. I'm-I'm fine.

110
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,554
Wait a minute. So...
Well, do you want me to call a taxi?

111
00:14:05,638 --> 00:14:08,224
- No, no. I can manage, Andreas. Thank you.
- All right.

112
00:14:08,307 --> 00:14:09,850
Thank you very much.

113
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:12,603
- Don't worry. There won't be a scandal.
- Mm-hmm.

114
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:14,438
Bye.

115
00:14:15,981 --> 00:14:18,359
- I'd love to see the church.
- Yeah.

116
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:32,831
- Are you all done?
- Mm-hmm.

117
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:44,718
It's cold.

118
00:14:57,398 --> 00:15:01,110
I'll go upstairs
and say good night to Maria.

119
00:15:01,193 --> 00:15:02,820
Mm-mmm.

120
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:07,324
- We ought to have a place for that.
- Yes.

121
00:15:09,368 --> 00:15:11,495
- I'll take Bobby out for a walk.
- Yes, you do that.

122
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:13,038
Bobby, come on.

123
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:18,877
I'm glad he didn't stay too long.

124
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,213
When are you due
at the hospital tomorrow?

125
00:15:21,297 --> 00:15:23,757
At 7:00. I have surgery at 7:30.

126
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,761
- How did you like him?
- A damned nice fellow, I thought.

127
00:15:27,845 --> 00:15:29,597
But he drank a bit too much, didn't he?

128
00:15:30,222 --> 00:15:33,058
Did he? I didn't notice, actually.

129
00:15:33,142 --> 00:15:35,477
Foreigners, you know.

130
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:37,730
How did you actually meet?

131
00:15:39,732 --> 00:15:44,069
Jakobi at the museum called me
and asked me to take care of him.

132
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:47,072
He had a kidney stone attack.

133
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:49,825
Is that right?

134
00:15:55,247 --> 00:15:57,291
I'm too tired to read tonight, I think.

135
00:15:57,374 --> 00:15:59,585
No, please, no reading tonight.

136
00:16:00,753 --> 00:16:02,004
Mmm.

137
00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:03,964
Hold me.

138
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:08,594
Mmm.

139
00:16:12,306 --> 00:16:15,851
You know, already during dessert,
I decided to seduce you tonight.

140
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:18,604
- Mm-hmm?
- But now I'm just too sleepy.

141
00:16:20,272 --> 00:16:23,233
It's all right. I'm sleepy, too.

142
00:16:24,193 --> 00:16:26,987
- Then we'll go to sleep.
- Mmm.

143
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:30,908
- Good night.
- Mmm.

144
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:35,329
Mmm.

145
00:16:38,207 --> 00:16:40,751
- Give me your hand.
- Mmm.

146
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:41,960
There.

147
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:45,839
It's good to hold your hand.

148
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:48,592
Mmm.

149
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:53,597
Hey.

150
00:16:53,681 --> 00:16:55,683
Did you take your pill?

151
00:16:57,017 --> 00:17:01,271
It doesn't matter tonight, does it?
Don't worry.

152
00:17:01,897 --> 00:17:04,566
"Don't worry"?

153
00:17:33,095 --> 00:17:35,013
Good morning, sleepyhead.

154
00:17:35,431 --> 00:17:36,432
Hey.

155
00:17:36,515 --> 00:17:37,725
There you are.

156
00:18:20,976 --> 00:18:22,978
- Bye then.
- Bye.

157
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:24,938
- Bye.
- Bye, Dad.

158
00:18:25,022 --> 00:18:28,025
See you at dinner.
You all have a nice day.

159
00:18:29,985 --> 00:18:31,236
Let's get a move on.

160
00:18:32,154 --> 00:18:33,447
Take the apple.

161
00:18:35,032 --> 00:18:37,159
Oh, I forgot.

162
00:19:54,403 --> 00:19:55,904
Look.

163
00:19:56,321 --> 00:19:57,948
Wait a minute.

164
00:20:11,295 --> 00:20:13,505
Karin. Come have a look.

165
00:20:20,345 --> 00:20:22,681
- Can you see her?
- Yes.

166
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:33,775
Can you see the smile?

167
00:20:34,568 --> 00:20:36,695
Yes, I do.

168
00:21:50,644 --> 00:21:52,354
Oh, no.

169
00:22:01,446 --> 00:22:02,739
When do I see you again?

170
00:22:02,823 --> 00:22:04,241
Tomorrow is Sunday.

171
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:05,867
Uh, Monday we have the housecleaning,

172
00:22:05,951 --> 00:22:09,121
but on Tuesday
I can come to your place at 2:30.

173
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:29,141
Yes. I think so, too.

174
00:22:30,684 --> 00:22:34,229
But the symptoms are kind of vague,
don't you think?

175
00:22:34,813 --> 00:22:36,732
Why don't you take one more X-ray?

176
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:40,569
If only she wasn't so damned hysterical.
It might be just nerves.

177
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:44,990
Yes.
We might bring her in for observation.

178
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:47,993
You send her right in.
I'll reserve a bed at the hospital.

179
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:03,759
Hi.

180
00:23:06,553 --> 00:23:08,430
Let's have lunch together.

181
00:23:10,307 --> 00:23:12,350
Yes. Come up to my office, won't you?

182
00:23:12,434 --> 00:23:15,479
I'll be there from... 12:30 on.

183
00:23:15,562 --> 00:23:18,106
Right. Bye.

184
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:22,861
- Did you have a nice drive?
- Yes, it was very interesting.

185
00:23:25,405 --> 00:23:27,824
You might have asked David home
for dinner.

186
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:31,328
I did ask, but he didn't want to.

187
00:23:32,245 --> 00:23:33,288
It's Vergerus.

188
00:23:35,624 --> 00:23:38,001
Let me speak to Sister Gunnel
in Ward 3, please.

189
00:23:38,085 --> 00:23:39,294
Yes. I'll wait.

190
00:23:39,377 --> 00:23:42,172
I'll go to the kitchen and help Maria.

191
00:23:42,255 --> 00:23:45,634
- She's going out with some friends tonight.
- Mind that she's home by midnight.

192
00:23:45,717 --> 00:23:47,302
Yes. We'll talk about that.

193
00:23:48,136 --> 00:23:51,431
Yes. Have her call me
as soon as she's free, will you?

194
00:23:51,515 --> 00:23:55,060
I'll be home for another 20 minutes.
Or she can call my secretary.

195
00:23:55,143 --> 00:23:56,478
Thank you.

196
00:24:03,318 --> 00:24:04,903
I need to tell you something.

197
00:24:05,654 --> 00:24:07,531
Really? That sounds intriguing.

198
00:24:19,668 --> 00:24:22,754
I don't think I'll be wanting
a housemaid after all.

199
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:26,424
Much better to do everything yourself.
Less fuss that way.

200
00:24:26,508 --> 00:24:28,718
Is that what you wanted to tell me?

201
00:24:28,802 --> 00:24:30,303
Yes. Why?

202
00:24:30,387 --> 00:24:33,890
You started off so seriously.
I thought it was something important.

203
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:35,684
No.

204
00:24:38,854 --> 00:24:39,854
Bye, then.

205
00:24:40,522 --> 00:24:41,522
Bye.

206
00:27:01,371 --> 00:27:03,790
No.

207
00:27:47,459 --> 00:27:48,374
- Ooh!
- Oh.

208
00:27:48,376 --> 00:27:49,753
Hello. I'm sorry I'm late.

209
00:27:49,836 --> 00:27:53,214
Oh, no, no, no, no. I have, uh... It's fine.
Uh, there's a lot of things that...

210
00:27:53,298 --> 00:27:54,900
- Can I come in?
- Oh, of course. Come on.

211
00:27:54,924 --> 00:27:55,924
Thank you.

212
00:27:56,092 --> 00:27:58,803
I'm really sorry,
because it was difficult finding the way.

213
00:27:58,887 --> 00:28:01,157
- You know, this whole part of town is...
- It's very complicated.

214
00:28:01,181 --> 00:28:03,350
It's one-way streets
all the way from where we are.

215
00:28:03,433 --> 00:28:04,934
- Yeah.
- I'm very sorry.

216
00:28:05,018 --> 00:28:09,773
Oh, no, no, no. I have a lot of things
that I had to look at.

217
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:13,485
Oh, I'm sorry. It's, uh... I have them
when I drive. They're very ugly.

218
00:28:13,568 --> 00:28:16,237
- No, no. Come inside, please.
- Okay.

219
00:28:30,335 --> 00:28:32,379
Oh, poor flowers.

220
00:28:32,462 --> 00:28:35,048
I think I'll cut them
and see if they'll revive.

221
00:28:35,131 --> 00:28:37,801
- Where's your kitchen?
- Oh, it's inside here.

222
00:28:40,595 --> 00:28:41,930
Thank you.

223
00:28:43,098 --> 00:28:45,600
- Do you have a knife?
- Oh, sure.

224
00:28:46,893 --> 00:28:48,645
- Here.
- Thank you.

225
00:28:49,396 --> 00:28:50,897
How did you find this place?

226
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:56,403
A professor at the university was
taking his leave of absence for a few...

227
00:28:56,486 --> 00:28:58,530
- A friend.
- Hmm.

228
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:02,700
It's a terrible place. Very depressing.
Don't you think?

229
00:29:03,701 --> 00:29:06,621
Well, uh, I hadn't noticed.

230
00:29:06,704 --> 00:29:09,290
It's, uh...
It's nicer than staying in a hotel.

231
00:29:09,374 --> 00:29:12,085
- Yeah. Especially now.
- Yeah.

232
00:29:17,841 --> 00:29:20,343
Oh, would you like some, uh, sherry?

233
00:29:20,427 --> 00:29:23,138
What I would like is a cup of tea.
Do you have any tea?

234
00:29:23,221 --> 00:29:25,140
- I'll see if I can find some.
- I, um...

235
00:29:25,223 --> 00:29:29,185
I-I think I'm out of tea,
but I'll just run down and pick some up.

236
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:30,437
It won't take too long.

237
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,523
Oh, no! Don't do that. Please.

238
00:29:33,606 --> 00:29:35,608
Let's have your sherry.

239
00:29:35,692 --> 00:29:36,860
Okay.

240
00:29:42,157 --> 00:29:43,741
Yeah.

241
00:29:51,666 --> 00:29:54,836
- You nervous, David?
- Uh, yes, I'm nervous.

242
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:58,047
My pulse must be 690. Aren't you nervous?

243
00:29:58,131 --> 00:30:00,467
Well, I-I'm almost fainting.

244
00:30:01,593 --> 00:30:03,428
<i>- Sk√•l.
- Sk√•l.</i>

245
00:30:06,222 --> 00:30:08,433
That looks very warm and comfortable.

246
00:30:08,516 --> 00:30:10,643
Thank you. You must excuse.

247
00:30:10,727 --> 00:30:14,397
It's an old sweater, and I'm...
I'm having pants on.

248
00:30:14,814 --> 00:30:18,651
I wanted to wear something very beautiful
when I came to you for the first time,

249
00:30:18,735 --> 00:30:21,863
but it suddenly turned so cold.

250
00:30:21,946 --> 00:30:24,782
I noticed some flakes of snow in the rain.

251
00:30:24,866 --> 00:30:28,161
- Yes. I hate it when it's cold.
- Yeah.

252
00:30:28,244 --> 00:30:31,080
It's a terrible climate here on the coast.

253
00:30:31,164 --> 00:30:32,749
Spring is always late.

254
00:30:32,832 --> 00:30:35,585
But I understand
this has been quite a mild autumn.

255
00:30:35,668 --> 00:30:39,130
Oh, no. No more for me, thank you.
It's already gone to my head.

256
00:30:46,638 --> 00:30:49,474
What should we talk about now?

257
00:30:52,185 --> 00:30:53,686
What should we do now?

258
00:30:56,606 --> 00:31:00,276
Shall we take our clothes off
and go to bed and see what happens?

259
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,778
Yeah.

260
00:31:04,197 --> 00:31:06,574
But we must draw the curtains.
I'm very shy.

261
00:31:06,658 --> 00:31:08,451
Oh, so am I.

262
00:31:09,452 --> 00:31:10,452
Okay.

263
00:31:38,982 --> 00:31:40,358
No, wait.

264
00:31:40,817 --> 00:31:42,277
Wait a little.

265
00:31:45,363 --> 00:31:47,824
I want you to look at me first.

266
00:31:49,867 --> 00:31:52,328
I'm 34.

267
00:31:53,121 --> 00:31:56,499
You can see that in my face,
especially around the eyes.

268
00:31:57,917 --> 00:32:02,547
I have... I have a scar here on my stomach.

269
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:05,842
I've borne two children,
and Anders was very big, you know.

270
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:09,554
My breasts were nicer before.

271
00:32:14,892 --> 00:32:15,893
I'm...

272
00:32:17,145 --> 00:32:19,981
I'm not a very experienced mistress.

273
00:32:21,316 --> 00:32:24,861
Andreas and I
always had it good together in bed,

274
00:32:24,944 --> 00:32:27,447
even if it wasn't so passionate.

275
00:32:29,782 --> 00:32:33,494
My legs are on the short side.

276
00:32:33,578 --> 00:32:36,664
And my bottom is a bit too big.

277
00:32:36,748 --> 00:32:39,751
It used to worry me a lot
when I was a girl.

278
00:32:46,382 --> 00:32:48,593
You don't... You...

279
00:32:49,344 --> 00:32:55,266
You don't have to act in any special way
in order to satisfy me,

280
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:56,768
if you see what I mean.

281
00:32:56,851 --> 00:33:01,939
I've no idea why I've come here to you
today, or why I'm going to bed with you.

282
00:33:02,982 --> 00:33:05,735
I don't even know if I'm in love with you.

283
00:33:05,818 --> 00:33:07,695
Forgive me.
Forgive me for saying all that.

284
00:33:07,779 --> 00:33:09,155
Oh, I understand.

285
00:33:09,238 --> 00:33:12,617
I suppose it's not a very good way
to start an affair.

286
00:33:13,368 --> 00:33:15,328
You see, I've never...

287
00:33:15,912 --> 00:33:18,247
I've never been in this situation before.

288
00:33:19,415 --> 00:33:23,586
David, forgive me for talking so much.

289
00:33:25,421 --> 00:33:29,509
I just wanted you to know
with whom you're going to bed.

290
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:36,724
Maybe it doesn't mean anything much
to you, maybe I'm making a lot of fuss,

291
00:33:36,808 --> 00:33:38,935
but this little affair, well,

292
00:33:39,018 --> 00:33:41,396
for me it isn't a little affair.

293
00:33:45,066 --> 00:33:50,154
Please, come into bed.
I feel terribly cold.

294
00:33:50,822 --> 00:33:51,864
Warm me up.

295
00:34:22,937 --> 00:34:25,314
I'm afraid I can't today.

296
00:34:25,898 --> 00:34:29,819
Oh. My long speech frightened you.

297
00:34:31,946 --> 00:34:34,073
It doesn't matter.

298
00:34:35,366 --> 00:34:39,078
It's good as it is,
as long as we're here with one another.

299
00:34:48,546 --> 00:34:51,215
- David?
- Mm-hmm?

300
00:34:52,717 --> 00:34:55,094
I think I must go now.

301
00:34:55,178 --> 00:34:57,013
Oh, no.

302
00:34:57,555 --> 00:35:01,642
I promised to meet Andreas at the airport.
He's been to Stockholm today.

303
00:35:29,212 --> 00:35:31,714
- Mmm.
- Are you disappointed with me?

304
00:35:31,798 --> 00:35:33,716
Oh, no.

305
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:37,470
No, no, no, no, no, no.

306
00:35:55,822 --> 00:35:57,865
My keys and my gloves.

307
00:36:14,298 --> 00:36:16,592
Oh, no. Not now.

308
00:36:17,468 --> 00:36:21,222
Not now. I'll... I'll come back another day.

309
00:36:21,305 --> 00:36:22,890
Soon.

310
00:36:23,558 --> 00:36:25,393
I'll call you tomorrow morning.

311
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,051
Yeah?

312
00:36:59,135 --> 00:37:01,137
<i>Hello. It's Karin.</i>

313
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:04,140
Hello. How-How are you?

314
00:37:04,223 --> 00:37:06,225
I'm fine. Have you been waiting?

315
00:37:06,309 --> 00:37:08,603
Uh, incidentally, I'm not quite sober.

316
00:37:08,686 --> 00:37:10,438
I, uh...

317
00:37:10,521 --> 00:37:13,900
I took a sleeping pill, but, uh...

318
00:37:13,983 --> 00:37:17,862
I couldn't fall asleep,
so I had a drink

319
00:37:18,487 --> 00:37:20,114
and another pill.

320
00:37:24,368 --> 00:37:27,246
No, if you want to sleep,
I can call you a little later.

321
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:28,789
No, no, no.

322
00:37:28,873 --> 00:37:31,876
You mustn't mind my being a bit... stoned.

323
00:37:31,959 --> 00:37:33,961
I'm not in the habit of it.

324
00:37:34,045 --> 00:37:37,298
I just didn't think you'd ring. I didn't
think... I didn't think we'd meet again.

325
00:37:37,381 --> 00:37:41,469
But why do you think that?
I told you I was going to ring.

326
00:37:49,435 --> 00:37:51,520
It's funny.

327
00:37:55,441 --> 00:37:58,319
There's something important
I'd like to tell you.

328
00:38:03,491 --> 00:38:05,660
- Something I've never told anyone.
<i>- Yes?</i>

329
00:38:07,787 --> 00:38:09,747
<i>What is it, David?</i>

330
00:38:14,001 --> 00:38:16,045
I'd like to tell you.

331
00:38:20,591 --> 00:38:23,260
But I have no words.
I'm mentally illiterate.

332
00:38:24,595 --> 00:38:27,974
Can't you come to me now, this instant?
I'm longing for you.

333
00:38:30,893 --> 00:38:32,311
What are you doing?

334
00:38:33,187 --> 00:38:34,522
Huh?

335
00:38:34,605 --> 00:38:38,359
What, are you going to make the beds
and tidy up? What are you going to do?

336
00:38:38,442 --> 00:38:40,879
You're going out to do the shopping
and buy a roast for dinner?

337
00:38:40,903 --> 00:38:44,699
Or what are you going to do?
Are you a domestic service agency?

338
00:38:44,782 --> 00:38:45,908
Or what the hell are you?

339
00:38:45,992 --> 00:38:48,160
Can't you come to me now? Can't you come?

340
00:38:48,244 --> 00:38:50,287
But I can't come now.

341
00:38:50,871 --> 00:38:54,917
David, you must understand.
I can't just drop everything.

342
00:38:58,713 --> 00:39:00,923
David, are you there?

343
00:39:03,009 --> 00:39:05,136
Why don't you answer?

344
00:39:06,345 --> 00:39:07,388
<i>Okay.</i>

345
00:39:10,391 --> 00:39:11,434
Well, I'll come then.

346
00:39:34,582 --> 00:39:37,043
David, I can't stay very long.

347
00:39:44,258 --> 00:39:45,468
Wait!

348
00:40:26,801 --> 00:40:28,177
David.

349
00:40:30,596 --> 00:40:32,264
What is it? What just happened?

350
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,520
I don't understand you. Please.

351
00:40:39,855 --> 00:40:42,566
Don't you think you're very childish now?

352
00:40:44,652 --> 00:40:45,861
Hmm?

353
00:41:03,879 --> 00:41:05,965
No! No!

354
00:41:10,511 --> 00:41:12,638
I can take my clothes off myself.

355
00:42:18,329 --> 00:42:19,955
Don't look at me!

356
00:42:39,558 --> 00:42:41,268
Oh! Oh!

357
00:43:17,554 --> 00:43:20,849
I called you several times
this morning, but there was no answer.

358
00:43:20,933 --> 00:43:23,352
No. I was up in the attic,
cleaning it out a bit.

359
00:43:23,435 --> 00:43:25,155
We have all these old clothes
hanging there.

360
00:43:25,187 --> 00:43:27,457
I thought I'd sort them out
and send them to the Red Cross.

361
00:43:27,481 --> 00:43:30,150
- Good idea.
- I thought so.

362
00:43:32,069 --> 00:43:34,363
Is something bothering you?

363
00:43:34,446 --> 00:43:35,739
No.

364
00:43:36,282 --> 00:43:40,077
My period is starting,
and that always makes me moody.

365
00:43:40,869 --> 00:43:42,288
Nothing else?

366
00:43:44,415 --> 00:43:46,542
No, I don't think so.

367
00:43:59,513 --> 00:44:01,348
<i>Non.</i>

368
00:44:23,787 --> 00:44:25,831
Did I fall asleep?

369
00:44:25,914 --> 00:44:27,791
Yes, you did.

370
00:44:34,631 --> 00:44:35,758
Mmm.

371
00:44:37,009 --> 00:44:39,136
- Sleep well.
- Mmm.

372
00:45:15,339 --> 00:45:16,548
David.

373
00:45:31,063 --> 00:45:33,148
Why haven't you been in touch?

374
00:45:34,149 --> 00:45:36,568
I tried to call you several times.

375
00:45:39,113 --> 00:45:40,913
Yesterday,
I even went and rang your doorbell.

376
00:45:40,989 --> 00:45:43,909
I could hear you were in,
but you didn't open.

377
00:45:44,535 --> 00:45:46,161
Come with me.

378
00:45:59,591 --> 00:46:01,593
Why do you go on like this?

379
00:46:02,928 --> 00:46:05,472
I can't bear your silence.

380
00:46:05,556 --> 00:46:07,391
That's the only thing I can't bear.

381
00:46:10,185 --> 00:46:12,187
Why do you go on like this?

382
00:46:13,772 --> 00:46:16,525
If only you'll have patience with me.

383
00:46:18,402 --> 00:46:21,113
I'll have all the patience in the world.

384
00:46:21,613 --> 00:46:24,950
I've no demands.
Don't think I'm making any demands.

385
00:46:26,452 --> 00:46:29,872
I don't know what to do
with all these churned-up feelings.

386
00:46:29,955 --> 00:46:33,459
David, as long as we don't
lose each other. That's all that matters.

387
00:46:33,542 --> 00:46:37,254
That's why it's so important
that you don't leave me outside.

388
00:46:37,337 --> 00:46:39,840
I'd be so powerless then.

389
00:46:51,101 --> 00:46:53,770
All my relatives are dead.

390
00:46:56,857 --> 00:47:00,152
We lived in Berlin, just outside the city.

391
00:47:01,403 --> 00:47:06,492
My father was...
head of a private medical clinic.

392
00:47:11,455 --> 00:47:17,878
I was four when he suddenly sent Mother
and me and my sister to New York.

393
00:47:19,922 --> 00:47:24,468
Six months later, we lost contact
with our relatives in Germany.

394
00:47:25,511 --> 00:47:28,555
They were wiped out in various camps.

395
00:47:32,392 --> 00:47:37,231
After Mother died,
I went to Israel where I was trained.

396
00:47:40,734 --> 00:47:44,655
I think I keep the album
for Mother's sake.

397
00:47:49,826 --> 00:47:52,621
Here she is as a young girl, just engaged.

398
00:47:52,704 --> 00:47:55,457
- Don't you think she's pretty?
- Very.

399
00:47:56,458 --> 00:47:59,545
Sometimes it feels so lonely
without Mother.

400
00:47:59,962 --> 00:48:02,631
Isn't it absurd? After all, I'm grown up.

401
00:48:07,928 --> 00:48:11,431
Then, of course,
the very special surprise

402
00:48:11,515 --> 00:48:12,933
today at the end of the congress

403
00:48:13,016 --> 00:48:16,645
that we had the chance to meet
your charming wife, Karin.

404
00:48:16,728 --> 00:48:20,274
And thank you
for giving this wonderful luncheon.

405
00:48:20,357 --> 00:48:22,734
Thank you, both of you.
And, as you do in Sweden...

406
00:48:22,818 --> 00:48:24,570
<i>Sk√•l.</i>
Thank you very much.

407
00:48:24,653 --> 00:48:25,654
Thank you.

408
00:48:25,737 --> 00:48:27,406
<i>Sk√•l. Sk√•l.</i>

409
00:48:27,489 --> 00:48:29,616
I hope you all will be back very soon.

410
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:31,243
Thank you. Surely.

411
00:48:31,326 --> 00:48:33,203
As guests, not as patients.

412
00:48:35,247 --> 00:48:38,458
Would you like some coffee?
We'll have it in here.

413
00:50:59,641 --> 00:51:00,976
Hello.

414
00:51:01,059 --> 00:51:02,745
Where have you been?
I've been waiting for you.

415
00:51:02,769 --> 00:51:06,732
Oh, no, you can't be.
I told you I was going to be late.

416
00:51:06,815 --> 00:51:09,001
You said you'd be here at three o'clock
and now it's 4:00.

417
00:51:09,025 --> 00:51:12,571
No, I didn't say that.
I remember very well I didn't say a time.

418
00:51:12,654 --> 00:51:14,823
I knew I couldn't be punctual.

419
00:51:16,283 --> 00:51:18,243
Oh, it's dark in here.

420
00:51:19,870 --> 00:51:22,748
How could I know how long
the lunch was going to last?

421
00:51:26,251 --> 00:51:28,628
I didn't say a time.

422
00:51:29,838 --> 00:51:32,924
You were so persistent, I promised
to come anyway, even if it was only...

423
00:51:33,008 --> 00:51:37,679
...for... a short while.

424
00:51:41,933 --> 00:51:43,769
Am I right?

425
00:51:46,938 --> 00:51:48,732
You've been smoking?

426
00:51:48,815 --> 00:51:50,901
Mm-hmm. I have.

427
00:51:52,027 --> 00:51:54,070
But we promised each other to give it up.

428
00:51:54,613 --> 00:51:57,115
But I couldn't resist
after all that good food.

429
00:51:57,199 --> 00:51:59,534
I smoked five cigarettes.

430
00:52:00,619 --> 00:52:03,789
- Oh, aren't you cross now?
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

431
00:52:03,872 --> 00:52:06,792
Just we had an agreement.
And you've been drinking a lot too.

432
00:52:06,875 --> 00:52:08,794
Mm-hmm.

433
00:52:08,877 --> 00:52:11,254
I think I'm a little tipsy.

434
00:52:14,341 --> 00:52:16,968
Oh, I-I really am tipsy.

435
00:52:17,594 --> 00:52:19,554
I'm almost drunk.

436
00:52:24,309 --> 00:52:27,354
Come. Come and help me.

437
00:52:28,772 --> 00:52:30,857
I'm in a hurry.

438
00:52:31,691 --> 00:52:34,194
Come and give me a kiss
and say you forgive me.

439
00:52:44,287 --> 00:52:45,789
No one has ever struck me.

440
00:52:45,872 --> 00:52:47,374
I hate it when you're like that!

441
00:52:47,457 --> 00:52:48,917
I was merely gay.

442
00:52:49,376 --> 00:52:52,295
You're not sober, and you've been smoking!

443
00:52:52,379 --> 00:52:55,423
Andreas wondered very much
why I was in such a hurry.

444
00:52:56,049 --> 00:52:58,260
It was very difficult for me
to come here today,

445
00:52:58,385 --> 00:53:00,053
but I came because you kept on at me.

446
00:53:00,136 --> 00:53:03,682
I hate that goddamn Andreas,
that fucking hypocritical idiot!

447
00:53:03,765 --> 00:53:05,934
- He can go to hell!
- Stop shouting!

448
00:53:09,813 --> 00:53:11,481
You're crazy.

449
00:53:19,865 --> 00:53:22,242
You do look angry.

450
00:53:26,913 --> 00:53:28,206
Get out.

451
00:53:49,144 --> 00:53:50,729
Go to hell.

452
00:53:51,605 --> 00:53:56,318
Go back to your mediocre bourgeois.
That's where you belong.

453
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:02,991
There's no point
in our going on like this.

454
00:54:05,243 --> 00:54:08,538
Do you hear what I say?
Go to hell and leave me in peace.

455
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:12,250
You're being very silly.

456
00:54:25,931 --> 00:54:27,349
Poor David.

457
00:54:28,224 --> 00:54:31,853
Poor David, poor Karin.
What a hard time we're going to have.

458
00:54:34,898 --> 00:54:37,525
It's best for us to break it off now,
straightaway.

459
00:54:39,778 --> 00:54:42,197
If it only were that simple.

460
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:50,455
If you want me for anything, you can
call me tomorrow morning as usual.

461
00:58:05,150 --> 00:58:07,402
How was Maria?

462
00:58:07,485 --> 00:58:09,779
She was out dancing, you know.

463
00:58:09,863 --> 00:58:12,157
But she had this terrible cold.

464
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:15,410
- No, not tonight.
- Indeed?

465
00:58:16,244 --> 00:58:19,038
When was Maria ever sick on a Saturday?

466
00:58:19,122 --> 00:58:20,874
- Hi.
- Hi.

467
00:58:22,667 --> 00:58:25,003
- How's the movie?
- Not very good.

468
00:58:25,086 --> 00:58:27,505
- What do you mean?
- Just a lot of romance.

469
00:58:27,589 --> 00:58:29,174
Aha.

470
00:58:29,257 --> 00:58:30,675
Are you hungry?

471
00:58:30,758 --> 00:58:33,386
I already had a sandwich in the kitchen.
Good night.

472
00:58:33,469 --> 00:58:35,889
Good night.
I'll be up later to turn the lights out.

473
00:58:35,972 --> 00:58:37,807
Yes. All right.

474
00:58:37,891 --> 00:58:40,476
Good night. Sleep well.

475
00:58:53,990 --> 00:58:56,242
What's that sore on your lip?

476
00:58:56,326 --> 00:58:58,077
I don't know.

477
00:58:58,161 --> 00:58:59,829
I only just noticed it myself.

478
00:59:01,206 --> 00:59:05,210
- Could it maybe be vitamin deficiency?
- No. I hardly think so.

479
00:59:19,432 --> 00:59:22,644
I'm attending a conference in Rome
in April. Do you want to come?

480
00:59:24,103 --> 00:59:27,774
I don't think I can.
I need to get someone to watch the kids.

481
00:59:28,358 --> 00:59:29,984
That's already been taken care of.

482
00:59:30,526 --> 00:59:32,320
I phoned Eva today.

483
00:59:32,403 --> 00:59:34,489
She said it would suit her fine.

484
00:59:34,572 --> 00:59:37,200
She's even looking forward to it.

485
00:59:37,575 --> 00:59:39,869
She's alone after the divorce, poor thing.

486
00:59:40,161 --> 00:59:42,664
Sure. We'll talk about it.

487
00:59:42,747 --> 00:59:44,999
You don't sound overly enthusiastic.

488
00:59:45,083 --> 00:59:47,752
It's just my way, you know. I'm sorry.

489
00:59:50,505 --> 00:59:52,006
Sure, I know you.

490
00:59:53,007 --> 00:59:54,509
Now, let's go to bed.

491
00:59:54,884 --> 00:59:57,387
You'll beat me anyway.

492
00:59:58,221 --> 00:59:59,639
I'll just take Bobby for a walk.

493
01:00:27,250 --> 01:00:28,459
Karin.

494
01:00:29,919 --> 01:00:31,129
Come here, will you?

495
01:02:10,686 --> 01:02:14,732
Oh, this is a Swedish poet
whom I love very much.

496
01:02:14,816 --> 01:02:16,317
I think he's the best.

497
01:02:16,401 --> 01:02:17,944
I think I read him in Swedish first,

498
01:02:18,027 --> 01:02:20,363
and then I translate so you can just hear.

499
01:02:37,255 --> 01:02:40,758
"Wake me to sleep in you...

500
01:02:42,927 --> 01:02:45,680
wake my words to you...

501
01:02:47,390 --> 01:02:50,935
light my dead stars nearer you."

502
01:03:08,119 --> 01:03:10,913
"Dream me out of my world...

503
01:03:12,498 --> 01:03:15,293
home to the"... Mm.

504
01:03:16,002 --> 01:03:18,129
"to the home of the flames.

505
01:03:21,174 --> 01:03:23,509
Give birth to me, leave me.

506
01:03:25,052 --> 01:03:26,596
Kill me nearer you."

507
01:03:41,402 --> 01:03:43,988
"Nearer me to you,

508
01:03:44,071 --> 01:03:47,283
nearer the"... Mm.

509
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:49,869
What do you call fireplace?

510
01:03:52,121 --> 01:03:54,290
Something they had in...

511
01:03:55,666 --> 01:03:56,876
long ago.

512
01:03:56,959 --> 01:03:59,128
- A hearth?
- Hearth.

513
01:03:59,921 --> 01:04:02,632
"Nearer the hearth of birth.

514
01:04:05,885 --> 01:04:08,888
Take me warmer, take me nearer you."

515
01:04:20,107 --> 01:04:21,484
When do you leave?

516
01:04:21,567 --> 01:04:23,194
Tomorrow, early.

517
01:04:24,487 --> 01:04:25,821
When will you be back?

518
01:04:25,905 --> 01:04:28,324
About six months... September, October.

519
01:04:30,868 --> 01:04:32,954
How long do you stay then?

520
01:04:33,037 --> 01:04:35,039
About the same amount of time.

521
01:04:37,208 --> 01:04:39,752
What will you do
when you get back to London?

522
01:04:39,835 --> 01:04:42,713
Oh, I'll prepare a series of lectures,
18 of them.

523
01:04:42,797 --> 01:04:44,298
In the summer.

524
01:04:44,382 --> 01:04:46,133
Yes, in the summer.

525
01:04:52,557 --> 01:04:56,352
We've been together for... six months now.

526
01:04:58,521 --> 01:05:00,606
It's going to be very hard.

527
01:05:02,608 --> 01:05:04,777
It's going to be very hard.

528
01:05:21,544 --> 01:05:23,379
What's that music?

529
01:05:24,547 --> 01:05:26,299
I think they're practicing something

530
01:05:26,382 --> 01:05:29,343
for the reconsecration of the church
on Sunday.

531
01:05:31,887 --> 01:05:34,765
I think it's better
we say good-bye here and now.

532
01:05:42,732 --> 01:05:47,069
Andreas wanted you to come to dinner,
but I said I thought you were engaged.

533
01:05:50,489 --> 01:05:53,951
It's much better we say good-bye now
when we're by ourselves.

534
01:05:56,245 --> 01:05:59,832
<i>‚ô™ Alleluia ‚ô™</i>

535
01:05:59,915 --> 01:06:02,001
<i>‚ô™ Alleluia... ‚ô™</i>

536
01:06:02,084 --> 01:06:04,170
To think it should be so hard.

537
01:06:08,090 --> 01:06:11,677
I don't think we realize
how painful it's going to be later.

538
01:06:15,681 --> 01:06:17,475
I must go.

539
01:06:17,558 --> 01:06:18,643
No.

540
01:06:19,644 --> 01:06:20,978
Yes, I'll go.

541
01:06:21,979 --> 01:06:23,522
I must go now.

542
01:06:24,482 --> 01:06:26,817
I must go before it gets too difficult.

543
01:06:52,385 --> 01:06:54,470
David, dearest.

544
01:06:55,179 --> 01:06:58,432
I didn't know it was going to hurt so much
being without you.

545
01:06:58,516 --> 01:07:01,143
<i>Karin, my darling Karin.</i>

546
01:07:03,145 --> 01:07:05,439
It feels odd to be back in the world.

547
01:07:06,023 --> 01:07:08,109
It's getting cold again.

548
01:07:08,192 --> 01:07:10,986
Almost like autumn
although we're well into May.

549
01:07:12,446 --> 01:07:16,200
We've all had bad colds.
I was absolutely streaming.

550
01:07:17,493 --> 01:07:20,830
Which was a good thing, really,
since I cried so often to myself.

551
01:07:21,372 --> 01:07:25,626
I mean, I could go round legitimately
with a red nose and red-rimmed eyes.

552
01:07:25,710 --> 01:07:29,004
We've been separated now for six weeks,

553
01:07:29,088 --> 01:07:31,298
and we've written to each other
nearly every day.

554
01:07:31,382 --> 01:07:34,218
And I,
who am such a terrible letter writer.

555
01:07:34,301 --> 01:07:37,513
David, dearest friend I have in the world...

556
01:07:38,597 --> 01:07:42,017
can you forgive me
for not writing to you for several days?

557
01:07:42,101 --> 01:07:43,686
We've had spring cleaning.

558
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:47,773
I suppose you think
it's a very trivial reason not to write.

559
01:07:48,858 --> 01:07:50,293
But the house has been full of people.

560
01:07:50,317 --> 01:07:53,237
I haven't had a minute to myself
from morning till night.

561
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:56,449
One day, I stopped dead in my tracks

562
01:07:56,532 --> 01:07:58,367
and said aloud to myself...

563
01:07:59,785 --> 01:08:01,245
"We're painfully united."

564
01:08:01,328 --> 01:08:05,207
Otherwise,
I spend a lot of time consoling Maria,

565
01:08:05,291 --> 01:08:07,418
who's had her first broken romance.

566
01:08:08,794 --> 01:08:10,713
The heartache and the tears.

567
01:08:10,796 --> 01:08:13,048
<i>Karin dearest,</i>

568
01:08:13,132 --> 01:08:17,928
<i>I'm now in the south of France at a sort
of summer congress for archaeologists.</i>

569
01:08:18,012 --> 01:08:19,597
<i>It's very hot.</i>

570
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:21,432
<i>Dear, dear David.</i>

571
01:08:22,266 --> 01:08:25,603
<i>We're back from the country.
I must say I'm glad.</i>

572
01:08:25,686 --> 01:08:27,062
<i>Karin, just a quick note.</i>

573
01:08:27,146 --> 01:08:30,107
<i>I've been able to rent our dingy,
ugly old apartment.</i>

574
01:08:30,191 --> 01:08:32,193
<i>Am arriving Thursday by air.</i>

575
01:08:32,276 --> 01:08:34,403
<i>I'll ring you Friday morning
at eight o'clock.</i>

576
01:08:34,487 --> 01:08:36,197
<i>Eight o'clock, Friday morning.</i>

577
01:09:26,497 --> 01:09:28,165
Imagine, I forgot my briefcase.

578
01:09:28,249 --> 01:09:29,875
It's the first time, surely.

579
01:09:29,959 --> 01:09:31,836
- Will you be on time?
- Oh, yes.

580
01:09:31,919 --> 01:09:34,296
- Any tea left?
- I don't know.

581
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:36,924
It's still hot.
Will you have a cup with me?

582
01:09:37,007 --> 01:09:39,301
No, thanks. I already had coffee.

583
01:09:44,390 --> 01:09:46,016
What are you doing, dear?

584
01:09:46,934 --> 01:09:49,144
I'm just paying some bills.

585
01:09:53,065 --> 01:09:55,067
You're not in any hurry today?

586
01:09:56,235 --> 01:09:57,862
It's not even half past.

587
01:10:02,533 --> 01:10:04,159
Drive carefully.

588
01:11:11,101 --> 01:11:12,978
<i>At last! I thought I'd never get through.</i>

589
01:11:13,062 --> 01:11:15,397
<i>Look, I'm-I'm in a caf√© round the corner.</i>

590
01:11:15,481 --> 01:11:18,442
<i>I didn't know
that that goddamn phone was cut off.</i>

591
01:11:20,194 --> 01:11:21,612
<i>How are you?</i>

592
01:11:22,655 --> 01:11:25,282
Fine. Just fine.

593
01:11:25,366 --> 01:11:27,409
<i>Well, here I am anyway.</i>

594
01:11:27,493 --> 01:11:29,119
Maybe we could meet?

595
01:11:30,079 --> 01:11:32,414
<i>Not at all a bad idea.
What about this afternoon?</i>

596
01:11:32,498 --> 01:11:35,751
<i>I have to meet a couple of idiots
at two o'clock, but I'll be free by 4:30.</i>

597
01:11:35,834 --> 01:11:37,836
Can't you make it earlier?

598
01:11:38,504 --> 01:11:40,714
It'll be so short.
I must be home for dinner.

599
01:11:41,215 --> 01:11:42,424
<i>Okay, but...</i>

600
01:11:43,676 --> 01:11:46,387
<i>Fine. Or let's wait till tomorrow.</i>

601
01:11:47,137 --> 01:11:49,223
No! No, I didn't mean that.

602
01:11:49,306 --> 01:11:51,892
<i>- What are you doing now?</i>
- Now?

603
01:11:51,976 --> 01:11:53,769
I just switched on the washing machine.

604
01:11:53,852 --> 01:11:55,896
And I have to see Anders's teacher
at ten o'clock.

605
01:11:55,980 --> 01:11:56,980
<i>Come now.</i>

606
01:11:57,022 --> 01:12:00,317
But I can't. It's impossible.
I can't just drop everything.

607
01:12:00,401 --> 01:12:03,988
<i>Oh, come just for a little while.
Then we can meet properly tomorrow.</i>

608
01:12:04,822 --> 01:12:06,949
Okay, I'll come then. I'll come.

609
01:12:07,032 --> 01:12:09,451
<i>Look, it's filthy as hell
up in the apartment.</i>

610
01:12:09,535 --> 01:12:11,695
<i>I don't think anybody has cleaned there
for six months.</i>

611
01:12:11,745 --> 01:12:14,331
It doesn't matter. I'll come right now.

612
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:19,730
You look thinner.

613
01:13:20,773 --> 01:13:22,733
I've been ill recently,

614
01:13:22,816 --> 01:13:24,234
but I'm all better now.

615
01:13:24,860 --> 01:13:27,279
I haven't smoked one cigarette
since you left.

616
01:13:28,947 --> 01:13:31,116
That's why you're even more pretty now.

617
01:13:32,576 --> 01:13:35,204
I put on weight. That's not good at all.

618
01:14:57,911 --> 01:14:59,121
Come.

619
01:15:07,671 --> 01:15:09,089
Mmm.

620
01:15:29,276 --> 01:15:31,278
It's worth everything.

621
01:15:46,835 --> 01:15:49,338
I should be home by 4:00 today.

622
01:15:49,421 --> 01:15:50,839
All right.

623
01:15:50,923 --> 01:15:54,009
- Would you like some tea then?
- Yes, please.

624
01:17:12,671 --> 01:17:14,965
Damn it.
It's a delivery from the museum.

625
01:17:15,048 --> 01:17:16,550
I'll just be a sec.

626
01:17:23,390 --> 01:17:24,808
May I come in?

627
01:17:50,167 --> 01:17:51,918
Can we have a light on?

628
01:17:56,673 --> 01:17:59,301
Do you mind if I sit down for a moment?
I won't be long.

629
01:18:15,859 --> 01:18:18,070
I received some letters.

630
01:18:18,153 --> 01:18:19,780
It's a small town, you see.

631
01:18:20,781 --> 01:18:22,783
Everyone knows everyone else.

632
01:18:26,036 --> 01:18:27,913
Some people are so <i>thoughtful.</i>

633
01:18:28,330 --> 01:18:29,414
Ah!

634
01:18:30,582 --> 01:18:32,042
Anonymous of course.

635
01:18:34,878 --> 01:18:37,589
Naturally, I wouldn't take any notice
of those poison pens

636
01:18:37,672 --> 01:18:40,092
if I didn't believe
that they were telling the truth.

637
01:18:58,235 --> 01:19:00,445
Well, I don't really know why I came here.

638
01:19:01,488 --> 01:19:03,407
It was on the spur of the moment, I admit.

639
01:19:03,490 --> 01:19:06,576
But I felt that it was necessary.

640
01:19:09,037 --> 01:19:10,664
I have nothing to say.

641
01:19:10,747 --> 01:19:14,835
Karin says she feels a strong loyalty
to you and your marriage.

642
01:19:16,336 --> 01:19:19,172
I think you ought to be grateful
for that loyalty

643
01:19:19,256 --> 01:19:22,217
and hope that it'll survive
this affair of Karin's and mine.

644
01:19:24,761 --> 01:19:26,430
I think you better talk to Karin.

645
01:19:26,513 --> 01:19:28,974
I think you should take advantage
of her loyalty.

646
01:19:29,975 --> 01:19:32,727
I think you should make yourself touching
and helpless...

647
01:19:33,895 --> 01:19:35,439
talk about the children,

648
01:19:36,022 --> 01:19:37,899
about all your years together.

649
01:19:39,359 --> 01:19:42,696
You have the upper hand, Andreas.
Don't worry.

650
01:19:43,405 --> 01:19:46,950
I didn't come here to talk about myself,
David. I'm quite sure of that.

651
01:19:49,703 --> 01:19:53,748
I think I came here
to talk to you about Karin because I...

652
01:19:58,753 --> 01:20:00,672
But it may be a rationalization.

653
01:20:00,755 --> 01:20:02,841
That's all so very touching.

654
01:20:02,924 --> 01:20:06,428
What are you going to tell me about Karin
that I don't already know?

655
01:20:06,511 --> 01:20:08,305
Go now, Andreas.

656
01:20:08,388 --> 01:20:12,184
You've humiliated us both long enough
with this ridiculous visit.

657
01:20:18,023 --> 01:20:20,442
I don't understand
why you're so aggressive, David.

658
01:20:21,902 --> 01:20:23,320
I like you.

659
01:20:24,571 --> 01:20:26,740
I liked you at the beginning already

660
01:20:27,491 --> 01:20:29,784
when I took care of you
after your attempted suicide.

661
01:20:29,868 --> 01:20:31,411
It wasn't an attempted suicide.

662
01:20:31,495 --> 01:20:34,039
It was an accident
with that ridiculous gas stove.

663
01:20:38,585 --> 01:20:40,837
I don't think my memory's at fault.

664
01:20:42,589 --> 01:20:44,591
During our conversation
on that Tuesday night,

665
01:20:44,674 --> 01:20:48,094
you yourself described your accident
as an attempted suicide.

666
01:20:48,178 --> 01:20:49,596
Am I wrong?

667
01:20:53,391 --> 01:20:55,018
No, but we were never to speak of it.

668
01:20:58,438 --> 01:20:59,648
That's right. I'm sorry.

669
01:20:59,731 --> 01:21:01,608
Forgive me.

670
01:21:02,567 --> 01:21:04,903
I didn't mean to be offensive
or indiscreet.

671
01:21:07,572 --> 01:21:10,408
Have you anything else,
anything else you want to say?

672
01:21:11,076 --> 01:21:12,285
No.

673
01:21:21,044 --> 01:21:23,755
I don't believe that habit,
marriage, and children

674
01:21:23,838 --> 01:21:26,341
are any firm shield
against the outside world.

675
01:21:26,424 --> 01:21:29,344
- The outside world.
- Call it whatever you like.

676
01:21:31,388 --> 01:21:33,139
It was stupid of me to come.

677
01:21:34,224 --> 01:21:37,018
If you think that I'm putting pressure
on Karin, you're wrong.

678
01:21:38,478 --> 01:21:41,231
I don't intend
any emotional blackmail either.

679
01:21:41,314 --> 01:21:43,608
As a matter of fact,
I don't intend to do anything.

680
01:21:44,776 --> 01:21:47,028
She has to make up her mind for herself.

681
01:21:47,112 --> 01:21:48,989
That will be difficult enough.

682
01:21:49,906 --> 01:21:52,200
She hates any form of decision.

683
01:22:34,159 --> 01:22:36,161
Wasn't that touching?

684
01:22:36,244 --> 01:22:38,496
That was just too goddamn touching.

685
01:22:38,580 --> 01:22:40,206
That was touching as hell.

686
01:22:43,918 --> 01:22:45,920
Do you think he knew I was here?

687
01:22:46,004 --> 01:22:48,590
Of course he knew. He's not such a fool.

688
01:22:51,259 --> 01:22:53,261
Will you call me tomorrow as usual?

689
01:22:53,928 --> 01:22:55,930
- I don't know.
- Do as you like.

690
01:23:32,967 --> 01:23:34,511
Are you working?

691
01:23:36,388 --> 01:23:37,597
No.

692
01:23:39,849 --> 01:23:41,476
I'm just sitting, really.

693
01:24:17,971 --> 01:24:19,723
Let's go for a walk.

694
01:25:40,220 --> 01:25:41,346
Hey.

695
01:26:03,284 --> 01:26:05,954
<i>God dag, Maria</i>. How are you?

696
01:26:06,037 --> 01:26:09,332
I thought that green coat was very nice.
Why didn't you get it?

697
01:26:09,415 --> 01:26:11,918
Do you mind if I talk to your mother
for a minute?

698
01:26:14,796 --> 01:26:16,673
We can't just walk away like this.

699
01:26:16,756 --> 01:26:18,842
I know. I can see that. I must see you.

700
01:26:18,925 --> 01:26:21,386
- When can we meet and talk?
- I don't know.

701
01:26:23,012 --> 01:26:25,849
We can meet at the church tomorrow
at three o'clock.

702
01:26:29,227 --> 01:26:31,229
Please, let me go now.

703
01:27:16,316 --> 01:27:18,818
I'm sorry I'm late.
This weather is terrible for my car.

704
01:27:18,902 --> 01:27:21,279
- It stalls, and it's very cold outside.
- It's all right.

705
01:27:24,365 --> 01:27:26,200
Yesterday was a funny experience, hey?

706
01:27:26,284 --> 01:27:28,912
- Mm. I don't know if it was so funny.
- Hmm.

707
01:27:42,008 --> 01:27:44,510
- Have you heard about the Madonna?
- No.

708
01:27:45,678 --> 01:27:49,307
Something peculiar's happened,
something no one can explain.

709
01:27:51,267 --> 01:27:56,814
Before she was walled up, she was
the home of some insect not known today.

710
01:27:58,608 --> 01:28:02,654
The larvae have been sleeping inside there
in the darkness for 500 years.

711
01:28:03,655 --> 01:28:05,323
And now they've awakened.

712
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:08,493
And they're eating the image away
from within.

713
01:28:12,038 --> 01:28:13,748
Here on the child.

714
01:28:13,831 --> 01:28:18,252
Oh, a whole nest of them hibernating.

715
01:28:20,129 --> 01:28:22,090
They're not sure whether she can be saved.

716
01:28:23,758 --> 01:28:25,385
Actually, they're beautiful.

717
01:28:27,345 --> 01:28:29,305
At any rate,
as beautiful as the image itself.

718
01:28:29,389 --> 01:28:30,807
Don't you think, Karin?

719
01:28:39,524 --> 01:28:40,775
What is it, Karin?

720
01:28:40,858 --> 01:28:44,654
I've lost my... footing... whatever it is.

721
01:28:46,739 --> 01:28:48,908
I used to be fairly secure in my world,

722
01:28:48,992 --> 01:28:52,078
and now I'm insecure at home,
insecure with you.

723
01:28:52,161 --> 01:28:53,913
That's too bad.

724
01:28:53,997 --> 01:28:55,415
Yes, it is.

725
01:28:59,002 --> 01:29:01,004
I can't be without you.

726
01:29:02,255 --> 01:29:04,465
Everything circles around you.

727
01:29:04,966 --> 01:29:06,801
You're there the whole time.

728
01:29:08,136 --> 01:29:10,888
You're like my newborn child.

729
01:29:15,101 --> 01:29:17,812
I understand how you think.

730
01:29:17,895 --> 01:29:20,857
I understand what it is that torments you.

731
01:29:20,940 --> 01:29:24,360
I understand why you're forcing me,
and it makes me furious.

732
01:29:25,862 --> 01:29:28,656
But it only binds me to you
all the more firmly.

733
01:29:30,700 --> 01:29:33,953
I wonder if something is wrong with me
because I feel like this.

734
01:29:35,955 --> 01:29:38,207
Yes. Laugh if you want.

735
01:29:38,291 --> 01:29:40,043
But let me tell you something.

736
01:29:42,253 --> 01:29:44,255
I know that you are going to leave me.

737
01:29:46,758 --> 01:29:48,593
I can see it quite clearly,

738
01:29:48,676 --> 01:29:51,262
and it's getting closer and closer.

739
01:29:53,890 --> 01:29:57,310
I know that you're fond of me
almost the same way as I'm fond of you.

740
01:29:58,978 --> 01:30:01,147
But even so, you're going to leave me.

741
01:30:02,982 --> 01:30:04,609
And I know why.

742
01:30:08,696 --> 01:30:12,158
You hate yourself.
Therefore, you hate me somewhere.

743
01:30:13,993 --> 01:30:15,995
I'm trying to reach you.

744
01:30:16,829 --> 01:30:19,957
I'm trying the whole time to reach you,
but...

745
01:30:20,625 --> 01:30:24,045
I feel that you're getting further
and further away from me, and...

746
01:30:25,088 --> 01:30:29,634
I just want to scream and weep
because I know you're going to leave me.

747
01:30:36,224 --> 01:30:38,226
It is hard to live two lives.

748
01:30:40,561 --> 01:30:42,313
It's hard to live with two men.

749
01:30:42,396 --> 01:30:44,899
Sometimes I find it almost impossible.

750
01:30:48,152 --> 01:30:51,781
But I know it can be done.
I even think Andreas would accept it.

751
01:30:52,990 --> 01:30:55,576
It is possible to live two lives,

752
01:30:56,160 --> 01:31:01,958
maybe slowly combine them
into one wise and good life

753
01:31:02,041 --> 01:31:05,670
that could benefit other people
and make them happy.

754
01:31:07,630 --> 01:31:10,675
But there's no living
with your self-hatred, David.

755
01:31:11,634 --> 01:31:14,220
I can't do anything about it
however much I like you,

756
01:31:14,303 --> 01:31:15,930
however much I try.

757
01:31:17,348 --> 01:31:19,183
Do you understand?

758
01:31:29,610 --> 01:31:31,195
It's cold.

759
01:31:38,536 --> 01:31:40,746
Can't you put your arms around me?

760
01:31:46,502 --> 01:31:49,463
Say something, something kind.

761
01:31:53,259 --> 01:31:55,511
Say that you like me all the same.

762
01:31:59,265 --> 01:32:03,060
Be angry with me, if you like,
as long as you don't leave me.

763
01:32:04,312 --> 01:32:06,689
I don't know what to do
if I haven't got you.

764
01:32:08,691 --> 01:32:10,109
Let's go.

765
01:32:47,688 --> 01:32:48,814
Karin?

766
01:32:53,986 --> 01:32:55,029
Karin.

767
01:32:56,864 --> 01:32:58,074
Yes?

768
01:33:01,953 --> 01:33:03,579
Karin, forgive me.

769
01:33:08,834 --> 01:33:10,253
Forgive me.

770
01:33:15,716 --> 01:33:17,218
Forgive me, Karin.

771
01:33:27,228 --> 01:33:29,480
We're with each other now, aren't we?

772
01:33:33,651 --> 01:33:35,194
Now at this moment.

773
01:33:36,570 --> 01:33:37,613
Yes.

774
01:33:39,865 --> 01:33:41,701
Now we're with each other.

775
01:35:57,294 --> 01:35:58,712
No.

776
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:02,920
The professor will be here any moment.

777
01:38:03,003 --> 01:38:04,213
I see.

778
01:38:04,838 --> 01:38:06,924
Then I'll wait.

779
01:38:07,883 --> 01:38:10,594
- Please excuse me.
- But of course.

780
01:38:18,060 --> 01:38:19,436
Is the letter done?

781
01:38:20,437 --> 01:38:22,898
Just one moment, please.

782
01:38:29,029 --> 01:38:31,657
Please ask Jakobi to come this afternoon
instead.

783
01:38:31,740 --> 01:38:33,784
Then we can talk undisturbed.

784
01:38:33,867 --> 01:38:35,244
Besides, I'm tired as hell.

785
01:38:35,327 --> 01:38:38,205
Jakobi at 5:30. Will that do?

786
01:38:38,289 --> 01:38:39,790
That will be just fine.

787
01:38:40,708 --> 01:38:41,917
Okay.

788
01:38:49,049 --> 01:38:51,594
Excuse me if I lie down while we talk.

789
01:38:51,677 --> 01:38:53,679
I've got a splitting headache.

790
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:04,732
All right. What was it you wanted to say?

791
01:39:05,441 --> 01:39:07,109
Something unpleasant, no doubt.

792
01:39:09,194 --> 01:39:10,821
David has gone.

793
01:39:11,238 --> 01:39:13,907
I must go to London and try to find him.

794
01:39:15,034 --> 01:39:19,496
I must speak to him.
He has to tell me why he left me.

795
01:39:19,580 --> 01:39:21,332
Please try to understand.

796
01:39:22,958 --> 01:39:25,336
If you go, you needn't come back again.

797
01:39:27,171 --> 01:39:29,673
But if you stay
and try to get rid of your panic,

798
01:39:29,757 --> 01:39:31,759
I promise to help you in every way.

799
01:39:31,842 --> 01:39:33,761
I'd only be gone for a few days.

800
01:39:34,094 --> 01:39:37,264
If you go, there's no way back.
Do you hear? It's that simple.

801
01:39:37,348 --> 01:39:39,767
Just one day, Andreas. I beg you.

802
01:39:39,850 --> 01:39:41,185
Please be fair.

803
01:39:42,019 --> 01:39:43,437
You should talk about fairness!

804
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:45,731
Don't come crying for consideration
or sympathy.

805
01:39:45,814 --> 01:39:47,983
Take responsibility. Own up to it.

806
01:39:48,651 --> 01:39:52,237
For once, Karin, make a decision
and accept the consequences.

807
01:39:55,282 --> 01:39:58,327
This drama has been going on
for almost two years. Now I'm tired.

808
01:39:58,410 --> 01:40:00,412
I don't want to be in another act.

809
01:40:01,664 --> 01:40:04,750
Suffering must have an end.
It can't go indefinitely.

810
01:40:04,833 --> 01:40:07,920
I don't want to be poisoned
by hatred and spite.

811
01:40:08,003 --> 01:40:09,630
I don't want to hate you.

812
01:40:11,924 --> 01:40:13,676
I have to go.

813
01:40:24,019 --> 01:40:26,355
Will you tell the children? Or shall I?

814
01:40:26,980 --> 01:40:28,607
It's better that you do it.

815
01:40:38,325 --> 01:40:39,993
I'd prefer that you leave now.

816
01:40:58,303 --> 01:41:00,389
What are you going to do in England?

817
01:41:00,472 --> 01:41:01,807
I don't know.

818
01:41:02,766 --> 01:41:05,144
I'm going to see some people.

819
01:41:05,227 --> 01:41:07,312
What sort of people?

820
01:41:08,605 --> 01:41:10,232
- Friends?
- Yes.

821
01:41:12,192 --> 01:41:13,694
I'm here as a tourist.

822
01:41:13,777 --> 01:41:15,446
A tourist visit.

823
01:41:15,529 --> 01:41:18,240
Why didn't you say so to start with?

824
01:41:40,721 --> 01:41:42,222
Does David live here?

825
01:41:42,306 --> 01:41:45,017
Yes, he lives here, but he's not at home.

826
01:41:46,935 --> 01:41:49,938
- Can I wait for him?
- I don't think he'll be home today.

827
01:41:57,321 --> 01:41:59,281
Won't you come in
and sit down for a while?

828
01:41:59,364 --> 01:42:00,783
Thank you.

829
01:42:07,998 --> 01:42:09,666
My name's Sara.

830
01:42:09,750 --> 01:42:11,418
You're Karin. I know.

831
01:42:12,628 --> 01:42:15,255
It's a bit strange in here
with the furniture all gone.

832
01:42:16,131 --> 01:42:17,549
We're moving.

833
01:42:18,592 --> 01:42:20,177
You'd like some brandy?

834
01:42:20,260 --> 01:42:21,762
Yes, thank you.

835
01:42:25,557 --> 01:42:27,226
Are you his wife?

836
01:42:31,021 --> 01:42:32,439
I'm his sister.

837
01:42:34,316 --> 01:42:35,984
I keep house for him.

838
01:42:36,693 --> 01:42:39,071
He told me he didn't have any relations.

839
01:42:39,822 --> 01:42:41,031
Did he?

840
01:42:49,540 --> 01:42:51,083
Would you like something to eat?

841
01:42:51,166 --> 01:42:52,852
I have some sausage
or some cheese in the house.

842
01:42:52,876 --> 01:42:55,128
I could make you some sandwiches
if you're hungry.

843
01:42:55,212 --> 01:42:58,131
No, thank you. Thank you.
It's very kind of you, but I'm not hungry.

844
01:43:16,275 --> 01:43:18,277
Are you going to have a baby?

845
01:43:21,071 --> 01:43:23,657
- Is it David's child or your husband's?
- Does it matter?

846
01:43:24,783 --> 01:43:26,743
Why are you pregnant?

847
01:43:26,827 --> 01:43:28,453
I don't know.

848
01:43:29,037 --> 01:43:31,874
- Seems funny, doesn't it?
- Not to me.

849
01:43:38,338 --> 01:43:40,507
You're looking at my hands, aren't you?

850
01:43:40,591 --> 01:43:43,093
It's muscular paralysis. Atrophy.

851
01:43:43,176 --> 01:43:46,889
It runs in the family. Apparently,
it can't be explained scientifically.

852
01:43:46,972 --> 01:43:48,807
David suffers from it too.

853
01:44:35,228 --> 01:44:36,980
Well, what shall we do now?

854
01:44:37,981 --> 01:44:39,691
Shall we talk about David?

855
01:44:39,775 --> 01:44:42,903
- Why don't we talk about you?
- I don't think that can interest you.

856
01:44:42,986 --> 01:44:45,113
- You're his sister.
- Yes.

857
01:44:45,906 --> 01:44:47,324
Exactly.

858
01:44:49,034 --> 01:44:51,119
We have everything in common.

859
01:44:52,245 --> 01:44:54,998
We're inseparable.
He says he's never going to leave me.

860
01:44:56,833 --> 01:44:58,335
You understand?

861
01:45:01,838 --> 01:45:03,048
Yes.

862
01:45:10,180 --> 01:45:11,264
I think I'll go now.

863
01:45:12,224 --> 01:45:13,392
You'll come back tomorrow?

864
01:45:14,101 --> 01:45:15,102
No.

865
01:45:16,728 --> 01:45:18,730
I don't think I'll come back.

866
01:47:20,602 --> 01:47:21,853
Andreas?

867
01:47:25,440 --> 01:47:26,900
Andreas?

868
01:49:22,307 --> 01:49:23,516
David.

869
01:49:25,185 --> 01:49:27,604
Why do we have to meet
at this idiotic place?

870
01:49:28,772 --> 01:49:30,357
Let's go to my hotel.

871
01:49:30,440 --> 01:49:33,777
No. I can only spare five minutes.

872
01:49:33,860 --> 01:49:37,322
I'm on my way to my Italian lesson.
It starts at four o'clock.

873
01:49:37,405 --> 01:49:40,700
I think we can meet here
without anyone seeing us.

874
01:49:40,784 --> 01:49:42,369
I've had enough scandal.

875
01:49:43,536 --> 01:49:45,956
It never occurred to you
that this is a small town.

876
01:49:46,039 --> 01:49:48,124
Nor to you.

877
01:49:48,208 --> 01:49:50,210
I thought of it. I didn't care.

878
01:49:53,129 --> 01:49:55,298
- Are you feeling well?
- I feel...

879
01:49:56,466 --> 01:49:58,301
Can we sit down somewhere?

880
01:50:12,357 --> 01:50:14,025
You wanted to talk to me.

881
01:50:14,109 --> 01:50:16,528
"You wanted to talk to me."

882
01:50:17,195 --> 01:50:20,073
Just what do you expect?

883
01:50:20,156 --> 01:50:22,450
You suddenly turn up God knows where from.

884
01:50:22,534 --> 01:50:25,054
You call me up in the middle of dinner
and say you must talk to me.

885
01:50:25,078 --> 01:50:28,039
It's terribly important.
I must come to your hotel at once.

886
01:50:29,124 --> 01:50:30,959
You must be out of your mind!

887
01:50:32,252 --> 01:50:34,754
You've no right to come here
and make any demands.

888
01:50:37,173 --> 01:50:39,134
I have nothing more to talk about.

889
01:50:39,217 --> 01:50:40,552
Good-bye, David.

890
01:50:59,112 --> 01:51:01,114
I thought I could live without you.

891
01:51:02,949 --> 01:51:04,951
I thought it would be possible.

892
01:51:05,952 --> 01:51:08,538
I thought I could go back to my old life.

893
01:51:09,831 --> 01:51:11,041
I can't.

894
01:51:13,418 --> 01:51:15,920
It hurts, physically, being without you.

895
01:51:17,255 --> 01:51:19,883
It's like a constant ache.

896
01:51:20,592 --> 01:51:23,053
Whatever I do, I can't get away from it.

897
01:51:24,888 --> 01:51:27,390
I didn't know it was gonna be like this.

898
01:51:29,392 --> 01:51:32,354
I didn't know
I was so terribly tied to you.

899
01:51:34,814 --> 01:51:36,066
I thought I'd get over it.

900
01:51:36,858 --> 01:51:38,860
When I left you,

901
01:51:38,943 --> 01:51:42,030
it was to be spared more feelings,

902
01:51:42,906 --> 01:51:45,075
tears, pain.

903
01:51:48,036 --> 01:51:50,080
I wanted to make a clean break.

904
01:51:51,790 --> 01:51:53,917
I wanted to have peace at last.

905
01:51:55,001 --> 01:51:56,753
But it didn't turn out that way.

906
01:51:58,213 --> 01:51:59,839
It only got worse.

907
01:52:04,052 --> 01:52:06,054
I can't live without you.

908
01:52:08,598 --> 01:52:13,019
It sounds so utterly ridiculous to hear
myself say I can't live without you.

909
01:52:13,103 --> 01:52:16,481
But it's true.
I can't express it any better way.

910
01:52:17,690 --> 01:52:19,901
Everything's changed, Karin.

911
01:52:20,944 --> 01:52:22,904
I don't know what it is.
I can't understand it.

912
01:52:22,987 --> 01:52:25,198
I'm no longer the same person.

913
01:52:25,281 --> 01:52:29,411
I think and feel and react differently.

914
01:52:30,745 --> 01:52:34,833
In the old days, before I met you,
I could live without living.

915
01:52:34,916 --> 01:52:37,168
I didn't care. Nothing mattered anyway.

916
01:52:38,211 --> 01:52:39,963
Don't say anything more.

917
01:52:41,631 --> 01:52:43,258
It just makes it more difficult.

918
01:52:46,052 --> 01:52:47,637
Listen now, Karin.

919
01:52:49,764 --> 01:52:53,726
I've been offered an associate
professorship at the University of Aarhus.

920
01:52:54,644 --> 01:52:57,522
We could live a settled life
on your conditions.

921
01:52:57,605 --> 01:53:00,150
You can bring the children.
Everything will be the way you want.

922
01:53:00,233 --> 01:53:01,526
You'll have your security.

923
01:53:01,609 --> 01:53:02,902
- David...
- No, no, no.

924
01:53:02,986 --> 01:53:04,320
Karin. Karin.

925
01:53:04,654 --> 01:53:06,531
Look, I'm-I'm not going to rush you.

926
01:53:06,614 --> 01:53:10,452
I don't mean that you have to make up
your mind right away, this moment.

927
01:53:10,535 --> 01:53:12,245
I can wait. I'll be patient.

928
01:53:12,328 --> 01:53:14,038
Please let me go now.

929
01:53:14,122 --> 01:53:15,874
There's no point in this.

930
01:53:16,916 --> 01:53:19,169
We have nothing more to talk about.

931
01:53:20,170 --> 01:53:22,380
You can't just leave me like this.

932
01:53:25,133 --> 01:53:26,342
Please don't go.

933
01:53:29,387 --> 01:53:30,638
Poor David.

934
01:53:32,307 --> 01:53:33,558
I love you so much.

935
01:53:34,476 --> 01:53:35,560
It's not true.

936
01:53:35,643 --> 01:53:38,188
That's true. That's the truth.

937
01:53:40,273 --> 01:53:42,901
No one has done me so much good as you.

938
01:53:42,984 --> 01:53:45,487
No one has done me so much harm as you.

939
01:53:46,905 --> 01:53:48,573
Even so, I'm not coming with you.

940
01:53:51,034 --> 01:53:54,204
You must have strong reasons...
if it's as you say.

941
01:53:54,287 --> 01:53:56,289
For me, they are strong reasons.

942
01:53:57,415 --> 01:54:00,251
For you,
they're perhaps no reasons at all.

943
01:54:00,335 --> 01:54:03,171
I feel it's my duty to stay where I am.

944
01:54:05,965 --> 01:54:08,259
I don't know.

945
01:54:08,343 --> 01:54:11,304
I feel it's my duty to stay here,
so I will.

946
01:54:11,387 --> 01:54:14,599
I know you're lying.
You don't mean what you say.

947
01:54:14,682 --> 01:54:15,934
I know the real reasons.

948
01:54:16,017 --> 01:54:18,770
They're so goddamn rotten
