1
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:40,455
DIGITALLY RESTORED IN 2017

2
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:04,687
TO JOY

3
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:22,803
Whom do you wish to speak to?
Stig Ericsson?

4
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,385
He's in rehearsal at the moment.

5
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:28,304
My goodness!

6
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:31,316
Wait a moment.
I'll go call him.

7
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,247
Grandmother sent me.
She couldn't make the trip.

8
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:39,584
I tried calling you at work, but I...

9
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:41,802
What's happened?

10
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,056
The kerosene stove exploded.

11
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:55,232
Marta and the little girl
were badly burned.

12
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:58,482
Marta's dead.

13
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:03,817
They said at the hospital
that the girl is okay.

14
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:08,910
They called just before I left
to say she was out of danger.

15
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,292
The kerosene stove exploded.

16
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,083
We heard it go off
and came running.

17
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:20,917
Marta died on the way
to the hospital.

18
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:33,100
Grandmother said she
and Grandfather are coming tomorrow.

19
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,185
They'll call you.

20
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:47,569
Lasse and I will go buy
a mourning band.

21
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:07,343
THE STORY OF
STIG AND MARTA'S MARRIAGE

22
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:11,677
BEGINS ON AN AUTUMN DAY
SEVEN YEARS EARLIER...

23
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,340
We're beginning a new season.

24
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:50,257
I think it'll be good.
I don't know how you feel.

25
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:56,016
We welcome two new members
to our orchestra.

26
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,649
This is Stig Ericsson.

27
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,943
He's replacing Sunkarn,
who died last summer.

28
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,108
God rest his soul.

29
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,153
Then we have a woman
in the orchestra.

30
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:11,869
It's sort of silly,
and totally against nature,

31
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,705
but she's reasonably talented.

32
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:18,039
She's right there,
if you haven't noticed her.

33
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:21,872
Her name is Marta.
Welcome to you both.

34
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,299
All right.

35
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:27,043
Let's get started.

36
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,116
Gentlemen!

37
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:47,035
Let's have the winds.
From the fortissimo.

38
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:17,990
Give me all you've got!

39
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,788
Well, you sounded awful today,

40
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,911
but that's to be expected.

41
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,629
Good afternoon, gentlemen...

42
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,165
and young lady.

43
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:38,006
Cortot is coming on Thursday.
Then we'll have some music!

44
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:47,015
Hi, Stig.
Imagine us ending up here.

45
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,809
How was your summer?

46
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,900
I was abroad with my brother
and heard lots of music.

47
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:54,943
And you?

48
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,313
- Summer orchestra.
- Poor thing!

49
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,699
I never want to play
"Gold and Silver" again.

50
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:05,034
- Did you work?
- I studied Mendelssohn and others...

51
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:08,449
- Why are you so angry?
- I'm not angry!

52
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:12,995
Did you find a place to stay?
- Yes. And you?

53
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:15,171
It's a nightmare, but cheap.

54
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,589
There's a party tonight
for my birthday. Care to come?

55
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:22,846
- I don't feel like it. Who'll be there?
- You'll see if you come.

56
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,965
Can you lend me a tenner?

57
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:28,807
It's awkward asking for an advance,
and I don't know anyone here.

58
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,394
If you could spare it, great.
- If you come tonight.

59
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:35,393
That's blackmail!
I'll come for 20.

60
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,396
- Get a haircut too.
- Why?

61
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:41,865
And buy me a present.
Nothing over 1.50.

62
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:46,245
And try to be pleasant,
not your usual grumpy self.

63
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,908
See you.

64
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:06,215
- What's going on?
- I'm cursing my fate.

65
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:11,346
You look unbelievably comical
all clipped and combed.

66
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,225
Is that Marta's doing?

67
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:15,645
- You know her?
- Sure do.

68
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:18,565
We had a thing
together all summer. You?

69
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,525
Just from the academy.

70
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:23,650
She has a great personality,
and she's hot to trot.

71
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:27,779
Ripe for love, if you get me.
- I didn't ask for a full report!

72
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:31,449
The way she left me
almost made me ask for her hand.

73
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:33,083
And?

74
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:36,162
Caught myself just in time,
but it was damn close.

75
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:39,836
- Well, I'm not interested.
- So you're not coming tonight?

76
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,925
No time or interest.

77
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,257
Of course you'll come.

78
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,798
Bring your violin.
We'll play before we get drunk.

79
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,633
See you.

80
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,867
I'd like something for 1.50.

81
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,040
That bear there.

82
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,212
This?

83
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:25,298
It costs 4.80.

84
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:27,588
I'll take it anyway.

85
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:30,182
- Shall I wrap it?
- No, thanks.

86
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,309
He's very cute.

87
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:36,517
Yes, those bears are very popular.

88
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:39,725
Thanks.

89
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,487
Stop that damned nonsense!

90
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,522
He pounded his fist and said...

91
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,492
"Stop that damned nonsense!"

92
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,320
It's quite a funny story.

93
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:55,332
I'll tell you next time,
when we have time.

94
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:49,462
Stop being silly and let me go!

95
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:03,650
- What are you grinning at?
- You, of course.

96
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,153
Well, stop it, damn it!

97
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:08,905
You're drunk, so I won't hurt you.

98
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:19,329
I'm magnificent when I'm on stage.

99
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,165
Have you heard me play the violin?

100
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:25,752
The big-name players
are all charlatans.

101
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:30,511
They get by on cheap tricks,
but I see through their charade.

102
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:33,847
I'll tell you the secret of real art.

103
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:36,592
It's created when you're unhappy.

104
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:39,561
I prefer being unhappy.

105
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:43,481
God knows it's the state
I usually find myself in.

106
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:48,479
I'll show you bastards
what the violin is all about!

107
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:52,992
I know you all feel guilty.
I know what you're thinking.

108
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,781
Are we artists...

109
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:58,155
when all we think about
is drinking, women, and retirement?

110
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,283
I'm drunk, I admit it.

111
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,168
I wouldn't dare say a thing
if I weren't.

112
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:07,001
But I see through you,
and through myself too!

113
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:10,634
And I say take it all away!
It's worth nothing!

114
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:13,846
I'll die and come back to life,

115
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,511
and then you'll hear
real violin playing!

116
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:20,268
Because it all comes down
to humility!

117
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,434
Remember that,
you despicable loafers,

118
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:28,402
as you wallow and slobber
and burp in your stained ties!

119
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:34,991
- Are you okay?
- Go to hell!

120
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:38,320
You're making a fool of yourself.

121
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:41,957
Did you get a haircut?
You look like a greased cat.

122
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:44,664
And it's your fault.

123
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:59,637
I can't figure out who I am.

124
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:03,145
Why can't I act
like a respectable person,

125
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,979
with all my talent?

126
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:09,063
Because I really am talented,
even if I'm drunk.

127
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:29,584
Have you met my wife Nelly?

128
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:33,542
I assure you she's worth knowing.

129
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:37,550
She's a fun little creature,

130
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:41,850
with a mouth like a red flower.

131
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:46,267
I'm thinking of giving you to her.

132
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:49,142
She'd appreciate that.

133
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:06,621
Why are you screaming?

134
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:11,046
The roof fell in... though I could see
it was just the curtain.

135
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,831
I have to lie down.

136
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:14,754
I feel awful.

137
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,419
You overdid it a bit last night.

138
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,885
I need to sit up.

139
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:27,642
What time is it? Where am I?
- 5:00. And you're at my place.

140
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:30,558
- Why?
- There was no moving you.

141
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:35,779
Stig, cut it out. Don't argue.

142
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,814
You're the one making a fuss.

143
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,863
If you can't settle down,
you'll have to go.

144
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,029
I'm awfully silly.

145
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:45,872
Yes, you are.

146
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,992
People like me shouldn't be alive.

147
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:49,910
You're harmless.

148
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:54,206
But couldn't you have bought me
that birthday present?

149
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:58,172
- I did!
- But of course you forgot it.

150
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:01,430
No, you'll see.
Where's my coat?

151
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,568
You probably think it's really stupid.

152
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:18,689
It was all I could come up with.

153
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:23,451
Thanks so much, Stig.

154
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:26,326
It's a very nice present.

155
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:31,789
We should get some sleep.

156
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:34,163
We have rehearsal at 9:00.

157
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:48,184
A person might act
crazy and stupid at times.

158
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:53,353
What's important is that he aspire
to be a real person and artist.

159
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,191
Hey.

160
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,898
You must agree with that.

161
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:01,198
Yes, I do. Good night.

162
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,651
Night.

163
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:16,998
AUTUMN HAS SET IN

164
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:29,055
- Sönderby is nice.
- He's a little boring.

165
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,681
Doesn't matter.

166
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:34,724
- You want to be like him?
- He's done good. I'd like to too.

167
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,266
You've got time.

168
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:38,106
I'm 25.

169
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:42,322
By then you should be
someone with responsibility.

170
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:51,073
I'd like to start
a brilliant string quartet

171
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,575
and tour the world.

172
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:56,169
We'd be the best!
- Of course.

173
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:59,627
I don't like
that odd grin on your face.

174
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,876
Just feeling friendly.

175
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:06,506
What about you?
What do you want?

176
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:08,598
Nothing.

177
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:12,728
I'd like to bury myself so deep
that nothing got to me.

178
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,430
But you're not unhappy.

179
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:18,934
Some people have
an unnaturally happy air.

180
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:23,606
We always talk about me
whenever we meet.

181
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:25,740
I know nothing about you.

182
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:29,657
- Perhaps that's best for both of us.
- Don't talk nonsense.

183
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,495
Hey, Stig?

184
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,833
Do you care for me a little?

185
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,672
What do you mean?

186
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:45,420
You've wanted to sleep with me,
and I haven't let you.

187
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:49,639
If I did, would you care
for me a little then?

188
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,471
Be honest.

189
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:55,140
Don't be afraid of hurting me.

190
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:59,058
See? You can't answer.

191
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:01,568
I have to think about it.

192
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:06,656
Of course I've wondered
why you've been so difficult

193
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:09,159
and put up so many obstacles.

194
00:22:10,371 --> 00:22:14,035
But we've had fun.
- You didn't answer my question.

195
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:16,916
I know exactly what you're asking.

196
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,912
You want some assurance
that I love you.

197
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:22,752
Otherwise you'll have moral pangs.

198
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:26,342
- God, you're stupid!
- Then don't speak in riddles.

199
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:30,221
I want us to be together.

200
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:36,515
I'm sorry.

201
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:41,434
I go on and on and forget
I'm talking to a real person.

202
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:46,572
There's so much misery,
laziness, and indifference

203
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:48,656
in both body and mind.

204
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:51,697
You end up
not believing in anything.

205
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:54,033
You think that's just how it is.

206
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:57,995
That's the whole meaning.
- There doesn't have to be a meaning.

207
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:00,251
Yes, there does.

208
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,670
Otherwise you make one up,

209
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:05,461
or you can't go on living.

210
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:08,426
I was married. You know that.

211
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:11,847
But it was just lies and deception.

212
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:14,637
I've deceived people
in my work as well.

213
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:17,385
I'm only moderately talented.

214
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:22,308
I've faked my way through
almost everything my whole life.

215
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:26,144
- I don't believe that.
- That's easy to say.

216
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:31,075
What's between us mustn't be fakery.
It either is or it isn't.

217
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:34,152
Are you scared?

218
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:38,331
There's such a thing
as taking things too seriously.

219
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:42,081
This will be just like playing
with words for you.

220
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:45,004
I want to be with you.

221
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:46,839
You've noticed that.

222
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:52,471
But one can't always be talking
about love and marriage either.

223
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:55,595
I promise to be as nice as I can.

224
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:57,888
We won't make any promises.

225
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,762
But we can promise to be honest.

226
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,977
That's absolutely necessary.

227
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,107
- And no insults.
- No.

228
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:08,774
And if we tire of each other,
we'll say so.

229
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,572
It'll be you who tires of me.

230
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:14,780
You don't really believe that.

231
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:17,988
No, we won't delude ourselves.

232
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,456
There'll be many difficult times,

233
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:23,748
more difficult than we can foresee.

234
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,791
- Let's stop now.
- Yes.

235
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:29,712
Let's go move your things
to my place.

236
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:32,210
It'll be practical,
and cheaper too.

237
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:35,927
Good. I hate my room.
I'll get rheumatism there.

238
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:39,509
We'll split the rent
starting next month.

239
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:51,400
I promise you won't have to sleep
on that uncomfortable sofa.

240
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:54,533
Unless you really want to,
of course.

241
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:10,650
Just what did you do
over Christmas break?

242
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:15,071
In this blasted town
where people just eat and eat!

243
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,899
You blobs!

244
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:19,947
This is a difficult part.

245
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:22,196
Not for someone with talent.

246
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:25,365
But some people are
lazybones and blockheads.

247
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:27,743
Once more from the top.

248
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:57,689
I can't listen to any more
of this frightful screeching.

249
00:26:57,825 --> 00:26:59,441
We'll take ten minutes.

250
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:01,112
Break!

251
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,763
We have to ask for time off.

252
00:27:30,107 --> 00:27:31,769
Time off?

253
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:34,643
Are you crazy?

254
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:38,279
You said last week we could leave
by 1:00. It's now 1:30.

255
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:40,986
I didn't realize then
you were so untalented.

256
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,152
In any case, we have to go.

257
00:27:43,287 --> 00:27:46,405
- Really?
- We're getting married at 2:30.

258
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,825
My God!

259
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,662
I completely forgot.

260
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:56,710
I should probably apply
for my pension and retire.

261
00:27:56,884 --> 00:28:00,377
I was supposed to be...
- Our witness.

262
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:03,846
Wonderful.

263
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:08,430
We'll just have to call
the mayor and postpone it.

264
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:11,472
You can't postpone a wedding
without valid reason.

265
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:14,857
But you can cancel a rehearsal?

266
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:17,485
A wedding date is respected
even in wartime.

267
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:19,696
This isn't a military unit.

268
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:22,608
It sometimes seems
like a concentration camp.

269
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:25,743
What impudence!
We'll rehearse all day.

270
00:28:25,913 --> 00:28:28,030
Without Marta and me.

271
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:30,915
Then you can leave my orchestra.

272
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:33,542
We make your orchestra!

273
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:37,046
You weren't given
the strap as a child.

274
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:39,712
And you're turning
into a child again.

275
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:43,511
Go to hell!

276
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,093
No, I don't want
to be where you are.

277
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:57,642
You know I'm not supposed
to get angry.

278
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:00,277
You're ungrateful
and inconsiderate.

279
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:03,068
I could have
a heart attack and die.

280
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,691
Good riddance.

281
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:07,534
Then at least honest folk
could get married.

282
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:11,197
This is what comes
from letting women into orchestras.

283
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:16,077
What's wrong with her?

284
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:21,006
Did you look in the toolbox?

285
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:23,091
Yes, and your jewelry box too.

286
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:25,094
Go buy a new stud.

287
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:28,223
How could it just disappear?

288
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:32,011
Sure you haven't seen it?
- Darling, I don't have time for that.

289
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:35,138
- Where is it?
- I'm coming.

290
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:37,102
Here I am.

291
00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:39,438
What a hurry we're in!

292
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:44,280
Getting married is time-consuming
and nerve-wracking. Admit it.

293
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:46,281
You having regrets?

294
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,943
Terrible regrets, to be honest.

295
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:52,285
Me too.
The ideas we get sometimes!

296
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:54,791
- We'll call and cancel.
- Now?

297
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,452
We made all this fuss to get away.

298
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,586
What would Sönderby say?

299
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:02,628
- You certainly handled him well.
- What do you mean?

300
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,794
The way you fainted
stopped him cold.

301
00:30:06,013 --> 00:30:07,754
That was for real.

302
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:10,973
Don't try that with me.
It was amateur dramatics.

303
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:14,970
- I see.
- Did you really feel faint?

304
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:17,355
- What if I did?
- Why?

305
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:20,983
It's not so unusual.
I happen to be pregnant.

306
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:26,486
You don't seem too enthusiastic.
Well, you don't have to be.

307
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:29,074
- How did this happen?
- In the usual way.

308
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:32,408
- Don't be funny.
- Dumb questions get dumb answers.

309
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:35,665
- Have you known long?
- Almost three months.

310
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:39,123
Hit me if you want.
- Why didn't you say anything?

311
00:30:39,296 --> 00:30:41,959
Because I want this child.
Understand?

312
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:45,674
- Children come, want them or not.
- You're so naïve!

313
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:47,759
- You mean...
- Yes!

314
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:50,763
- You never told me.
- Would it have made a difference?

315
00:30:50,891 --> 00:30:54,976
If you've had one abortion, you can
have another. It's all disgusting!

316
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:56,844
What's disgusting?

317
00:30:57,022 --> 00:31:00,982
Waiting three months to say anything.
How do I know it's mine?

318
00:31:02,152 --> 00:31:04,895
Besides, there's no room.

319
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:07,192
Diapers and pee and childcare

320
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:10,825
and babysitters and cribs
and God knows what else!

321
00:31:11,328 --> 00:31:14,446
All the crying and chaos.
Where will I rehearse?

322
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:16,447
Thanks so much.

323
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,121
How did you think
you'd pull this off?

324
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:21,619
You'd have to tell me sometime.

325
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:24,205
Think you'd come home
one day and say...

326
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:26,466
"Here's a baby for you, Daddy"?

327
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:29,085
Well?
- Should I apologize?

328
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:31,053
You don't understand.

329
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:34,182
I don't want a child.
I hate children!

330
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:38,057
You think this is
a good world to come into?

331
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,267
I prefer extinction.

332
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:43,892
Why don't you say something?

333
00:31:44,194 --> 00:31:45,901
I'm listening to you.

334
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:48,191
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

335
00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:50,948
You're talking nonsense... as usual.

336
00:31:51,118 --> 00:31:53,030
What do you want me to do?

337
00:31:53,203 --> 00:31:56,071
Hug you and say
he'll be prime minister one day?

338
00:31:56,248 --> 00:32:00,117
- I'd like you to act like a man... for once.
- Superman?

339
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:03,127
- A regular man.
- So now I'm not a man!

340
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:05,542
I knew you were neurotic,

341
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:07,961
and you're childish and selfish too.

342
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:10,926
But I didn't know you were cruel.

343
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:12,303
Do tell.

344
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:15,014
It's good I found out
before the wedding,

345
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:18,260
because now there won't be one.

346
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:21,679
We can't cancel now!

347
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:24,933
And they say
women are so conventional!

348
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:29,195
- What will happen now?
- I'm going to the tobacco shop to call.

349
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:31,321
Since you're not interested.

350
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:34,029
You can go on living here.
I don't care.

351
00:32:34,161 --> 00:32:36,869
I've never considered you
more than a lodger.

352
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:39,121
You're absolutely crazy!

353
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,407
Are you crying?

354
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:44,126
I've never seen you cry.
Are you upset?

355
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:45,753
No.

356
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:49,131
I'm just tired. Of you.

357
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:52,794
- Have I spoiled everything?
- What a thing to say!

358
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:56,135
Why are you crying?
You know what I'm like!

359
00:32:56,725 --> 00:33:00,594
I'm only crying because
I'm angry that I'm crying.

360
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:04,438
I wouldn't cry at all
if I weren't completely drained.

361
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:07,566
I guess you thought I'd be happy.

362
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:12,777
Deep down I knew
it would be just like this.

363
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:17,072
But of course
one imagines lots of things.

364
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:19,867
Maybe that's part of it too.

365
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:22,995
Did you do that last time too?

366
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:26,127
Everything was all wrong
last time.

367
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:28,997
It wasn't the time
to be imagining anything.

368
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:32,125
You mean this time...?

369
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,502
I sort of thought

370
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:38,305
things were different between us.

371
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:42,393
I should have known
that nothing ever changes.

372
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:45,309
Everything's always the same...

373
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:48,524
down to the words one speaks.

374
00:33:48,902 --> 00:33:50,939
I love you, damn it!

375
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,865
But sweetheart...

376
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:59,656
you know I've never liked surprises.

377
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:01,536
Even when I was little...

378
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:04,744
I'd get angry and upset
even at a nice surprise.

379
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,619
I think that's what happened
this time too.

380
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:10,209
I must say:

381
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:12,840
Your timing could have been better.

382
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:16,302
Hey, when I think about it,
we'll get child support.

383
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:18,295
That's fantastic!

384
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:20,844
The little guy
will practically support us.

385
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:24,686
And the orchestra can't toss you out
just 'cause you've got a kid.

386
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:27,437
Putte's sister
is always knocked up,

387
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:31,901
and she sits there playing,
her big belly hanging out.

388
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:35,654
And when the violin won't fit
under her neck anymore,

389
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:38,570
she still draws half her salary.

390
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:42,908
And we can always find
a new place if need be.

391
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:47,245
You talk a lot.

392
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:49,536
What I said
about surprises is true.

393
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:52,789
It's also psychologically credible.

394
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,257
I look so awful.

395
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:02,928
My nose grows
twice as big when I cry.

396
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:19,740
Say what you like, this will be
a wedding we'll always remember.

397
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:44,158
Marriage is for the individual's
well being and society's good.

398
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:47,946
You've indicated your willingness
to enter into matrimony.

399
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:53,710
Stig Ericsson, do you take
Marta Olsson to be your lawful wife?

400
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:54,994
I do.

401
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:59,461
Marta Olsson, do you take Stig Ericsson
to be your lawful husband?

402
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:00,875
I do.

403
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:04,045
You may place the ring
on the lady's finger.

404
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:14,559
By the power vested in me,
I pronounce you man and wife.

405
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:18,358
Never forget the promise of fidelity
that you've made.

406
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:21,066
Live together in mutual love

407
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:24,736
and safeguard the future generation.

408
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:29,488
May harmony and happiness reign
in your marriage and in your home.

409
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:21,588
Maybe he <i>will</i> be prime minister.

410
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:23,958
If he takes after you, that is.

411
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,262
The stud.

412
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:32,592
We'll keep it as a souvenir.

413
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:44,649
Well, we've got two weeks.

414
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:47,899
You and I have gone
through the concert twice.

415
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:52,445
You'll handle it adequately enough.
- Sure.

416
00:38:52,622 --> 00:38:54,329
"Sure," you say.

417
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:56,494
But I know what you're thinking.

418
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:58,284
What does your wife say?

419
00:38:58,419 --> 00:38:59,830
Nothing.

420
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:02,329
That worries me.

421
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:06,175
You two are trying
to keep me down.

422
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:10,846
If I were honest,
I'd prefer to avoid this high-wire act.

423
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:14,843
But what do you do
when your violin soloist packs it in?

424
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:17,602
You're being very closed-minded.

425
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:19,854
What are you staring at?

426
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:23,600
I'll tell you.

427
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:27,488
I'm staring
at that devil called ambition

428
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:29,607
twinkling in your eyes.

429
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:31,529
Is that so unusual?

430
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,531
No.

431
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:35,738
No, it's not.

432
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:38,244
It's not unusual at all.

433
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:41,456
But you've
only been here six months,

434
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:44,672
and you've yet to learn
that music is a goal,

435
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:46,631
not a means.

436
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:57,893
Well, what did he say?

437
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:00,145
It worked.
I have my chance.

438
00:40:00,273 --> 00:40:02,515
I'll show them
how the violin is played.

439
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:05,484
The sky's the limit now,
my little tubby!

440
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,604
Maybe I'll go
all the way to Stockholm.

441
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:11,027
There's no telling
what could happen.

442
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:15,244
It's a wonderful feeling
to have everything ahead of you.

443
00:40:15,455 --> 00:40:17,572
To know no limits.

444
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:21,705
You must be happy too.
This is for both of us.

445
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:23,619
Of course I'm happy.

446
00:44:45,141 --> 00:44:46,222
Come on.

447
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,842
I'm not going out there.
I'm no clown!

448
00:44:48,978 --> 00:44:52,016
You'll go out there
if it's the last thing you do.

449
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:55,433
It's not about you now.
Come on.

450
00:45:33,648 --> 00:45:36,482
Rehearsal isn't
until 10:00 tomorrow.

451
00:45:36,609 --> 00:45:37,975
You know that.

452
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:41,820
Goddamned bastard!
Now he's happy, of course.

453
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:45,107
Let's go home and have a drink.
We both need it.

454
00:45:45,243 --> 00:45:47,781
Come on.
We can't stay here.

455
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:50,492
Goddamned bastard!

456
00:45:50,623 --> 00:45:52,159
I'm simply mediocre!

457
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:56,251
- That went better than expected.
- Go jump in a lake.

458
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:20,817
It's better if you read it.

459
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:44,924
Read it out loud.

460
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:49,134
- There isn't much.
- Read what's there.

461
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:54,134
"Stig Ericsson
made a premature debut

462
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:56,387
in the Mendelssohn
Violin Concerto.

463
00:46:56,522 --> 00:47:00,232
It's surprising that an experienced
conductor like Sönderby

464
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:04,486
didn't prevent
this rather unnecessary suicide.

465
00:47:05,698 --> 00:47:08,486
Ericsson may well be talented.

466
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:11,618
The concert program indicates

467
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:14,613
he's been to the best schools."

468
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,491
Go on.

469
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:20,160
That's all it says.

470
00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:22,541
That's all...?

471
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:28,676
Was it that bad?

472
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:37,349
You must be happy now,
you and Sönderby.

473
00:47:38,356 --> 00:47:41,019
Just think how everyone will laugh!

474
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:49,363
- Where are you going?
- To make some coffee.

475
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:52,025
- I don't want coffee.
- I do.

476
00:47:54,372 --> 00:47:57,240
Of course
you think this doesn't matter.

477
00:48:09,095 --> 00:48:13,635
- Close the window. I'm freezing.
- I feel ill. I want some fresh air.

478
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:17,054
Why don't you say something?

479
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:22,556
Stig, what should I say?

480
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:24,557
That it went well?

481
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:28,069
That they printed lies?
That the whole world is wrong?

482
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:31,732
Shall I console you
and say it'll be better next time?

483
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:35,235
There'll be no next time.
You know that as well as I do.

484
00:48:39,208 --> 00:48:42,576
- I'd be happy about one thing.
- What's that?

485
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,583
That I can go to rehearsal

486
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:47,588
at 10:00 a.m.,

487
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:51,422
sit in my usual place, and do my job.

488
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:54,171
That shows
how little you understand.

489
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:56,514
I'm going out for a walk... alone.

490
00:48:56,684 --> 00:48:58,471
Can I go with you?

491
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:00,559
Please, Stig.

492
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:04,977
Alone, I said.
I don't want to drag your load too.

493
00:49:07,695 --> 00:49:09,937
Will you go to rehearsal?

494
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:11,688
I don't know.

495
00:49:11,824 --> 00:49:15,363
It's none of your business.
- You shouldn't push me away.

496
00:49:16,454 --> 00:49:18,867
There's a lot I shouldn't do.

497
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:23,458
These things are easier
when someone's beside you.

498
00:49:25,463 --> 00:49:28,581
But no one ever is.
Deep down you're always alone.

499
00:49:28,716 --> 00:49:31,584
What you're saying
is just sentimental jabbering.

500
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:34,211
I'm alone, just like always.

501
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:36,133
That's all there is to it.

502
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:40,221
Why are you so scared of me?

503
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:42,514
Scared?

504
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:45,388
What a laugh!

505
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:48,767
I want to be left alone, that's all.
See you.

506
00:50:08,923 --> 00:50:11,461
Sitting here brooding, are you?

507
00:50:11,759 --> 00:50:14,752
What about you?
You don't look so happy.

508
00:50:14,929 --> 00:50:17,012
Insomnia.

509
00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:19,598
Working on a character?

510
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:21,432
An act of creation?

511
00:50:21,602 --> 00:50:23,184
Not at all.

512
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:26,430
I heard the Mendelssohn yesterday.
It was awful.

513
00:50:26,607 --> 00:50:29,020
I didn't dare sleep after that.

514
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:32,060
Good of you to take it like that.

515
00:50:32,196 --> 00:50:33,812
You understand.

516
00:50:34,198 --> 00:50:37,691
I know it myself.
The great silence.

517
00:50:38,244 --> 00:50:40,406
Why that grin?
Everyone keeps grinning!

518
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:43,030
Am I that funny,
or is it coincidence?

519
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:46,124
Of course you're funny.
You fell on your face.

520
00:50:46,252 --> 00:50:47,914
Come on.

521
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:50,378
We'll have some coffee
at my place.

522
00:50:54,093 --> 00:50:57,427
Lord, what a mess it is in here!

523
00:50:57,763 --> 00:51:00,551
I can't tidy up every day.

524
00:51:00,683 --> 00:51:02,390
You never tidy up, sweetheart.

525
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:06,099
We'll pull the blinds
so we don't have to see it.

526
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:09,598
It was so filthy once that
the health authorities came by.

527
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:12,734
They said we'd have to move
if we didn't do better.

528
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:15,820
We had a dog then, but he died.

529
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:18,824
He had puppies first.
Then he died.

530
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:21,568
Probably from the surprise.

531
00:51:26,292 --> 00:51:28,249
You look so sad.

532
00:51:28,544 --> 00:51:32,754
I'd hoped to catch
the moon in a net.

533
00:51:33,007 --> 00:51:37,923
But just as I was going to pull it up,
it sank deep below me.

534
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:42,172
- Like a fish?
- No, like a big coin.

535
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:44,932
Oh, now I understand.

536
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:46,809
You're a treasure hunter

537
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:50,396
who sets out to sea
and fishes for sunken planets.

538
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:52,561
I've thought of buying a bomb

539
00:51:52,735 --> 00:51:56,445
to blow up a certain building,
with all the vermin inside.

540
00:51:58,157 --> 00:52:01,571
Puppy sickness, my boy.
Verbal diarrhea.

541
00:52:01,744 --> 00:52:03,610
Blow things up...

542
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:07,201
slam your fist down
and curse the heavens!

543
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:09,661
It all ends in a pension

544
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:13,082
and a medal
for loyal service. Cheers!

545
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:15,455
Shut up.
I'm talking to your wife.

546
00:52:15,633 --> 00:52:18,250
It's pointless being married
to an old pig like you.

547
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:20,923
Moving, isn't it?

548
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:26,762
- I'm going home. I have a rehearsal.
- Good day.

549
00:52:26,894 --> 00:52:29,432
Remember:
You're always welcome here,

550
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:32,351
no matter what state you're in.

551
00:52:33,192 --> 00:52:35,559
- Come back soon.
- Never.

552
00:52:35,694 --> 00:52:38,061
- Why not?
- I don't like you.

553
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:42,069
- Doesn't seem that way.
- Besides, this place is filthy.

554
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:43,824
Shame on you.

555
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:46,987
You do have a nice body,
but it ends there.

556
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:50,908
- That's nothing to sneeze at.
- You seem totally mad.

557
00:52:51,085 --> 00:52:54,749
If you think I'd share you
with that old bugger, you're wrong.

558
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,872
I haven't sunk that low yet.

559
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:58,839
Even so, come again sometime.

560
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:01,877
We can always talk
about the moon.

561
00:53:02,805 --> 00:53:04,717
I suppose we could do that.

562
00:53:06,475 --> 00:53:08,057
Cut it out!

563
00:53:38,257 --> 00:53:40,715
I thought I'd take a walk myself,

564
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:44,719
though I was actually hoping
to bump into you.

565
00:53:45,681 --> 00:53:47,547
We can go
in opposite directions.

566
00:53:47,725 --> 00:53:49,887
I was at Mikael Bror's.

567
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,892
Really?

568
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:58,900
- Must we keep talking about it?
- No, we'll never talk about it again.

569
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:03,439
Maybe when we're older,
and it doesn't hurt so much.

570
00:54:03,574 --> 00:54:06,567
- Did you hurt yourself?
- Did I?

571
00:54:07,828 --> 00:54:10,866
- No, it's just lipstick.
- Oh?

572
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:15,576
A strange girl there insisted
on trying to kiss me.

573
00:55:57,062 --> 00:55:58,553
Are you okay?

574
00:55:58,814 --> 00:56:01,022
It's on its way.

575
00:56:01,233 --> 00:56:02,940
Can I help?

576
00:56:03,944 --> 00:56:05,560
Are you scared?

577
00:56:05,696 --> 00:56:08,404
Yes, I am. Are you?

578
00:56:08,699 --> 00:56:11,863
I don't know.
I haven't felt like finding out.

579
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:15,578
In some ways
it'll feel good to finally get it out.

580
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:18,205
I'm glad it's not me doing this.

581
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:19,824
Me too.

582
00:56:22,254 --> 00:56:25,088
I feel awful.

583
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:27,332
Shouldn't we get going?

584
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:29,049
Not yet.

585
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:32,553
It'd look silly
if they just sent us home again.

586
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:34,715
That would be humiliating.

587
00:56:40,898 --> 00:56:42,514
Poor thing.

588
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:45,062
Shall I fix some tea
and sandwiches?

589
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:46,817
Yes, please.

590
00:56:46,987 --> 00:56:50,731
I don't know what's wrong.
Probably something I ate.

591
00:56:51,575 --> 00:56:55,194
Among some tribal peoples,
when the wife goes into labor,

592
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:58,663
the man takes to his bed,
screaming and carrying on.

593
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:01,950
He takes
all the congratulations as well.

594
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:04,077
Only fair, I guess.

595
00:57:04,212 --> 00:57:05,999
Right, Stig?

596
00:57:20,479 --> 00:57:22,766
Mrs. Ericsson, come with me.

597
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:25,273
Please stay here, Mr. Ericsson.

598
00:57:25,901 --> 00:57:27,813
Be brave, darling.

599
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:53,453
AUGUST THREE YEARS LATER

600
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:04,544
Your parents were very poor.

601
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:07,885
They had no food at all.

602
01:02:18,151 --> 01:02:21,315
<i>I'm glad I'm not a writer.</i>

603
01:02:21,988 --> 01:02:26,403
<i>If I were to take it upon myself
to portray Stig and Marta</i>

604
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:29,694
<i>from when we first met
four years ago,</i>

605
01:02:29,871 --> 01:02:34,411
<i>what a dishonest and incomplete
picture I would paint.</i>

606
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:39,125
<i>For example, I'll never forget
the episode last winter,</i>

607
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:42,832
<i>when I stopped by
to drop off a score for Stig.</i>

608
01:02:42,968 --> 01:02:47,178
<i>Maybe to chat a bit too.
I'm getting old and talkative.</i>

609
01:02:47,347 --> 01:02:51,091
<i>One has to watch oneself
so carefully.</i>

610
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:55,640
<i>The doorbell was broken,
so I walked in.</i>

611
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:58,806
<i>I stood in the dark entryway</i>

612
01:02:58,942 --> 01:03:01,605
<i>and peered into the living room.</i>

613
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:06,109
<i>How can I describe
the way they held each other?</i>

614
01:03:06,324 --> 01:03:08,657
<i>So boundlessly tender,</i>

615
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:11,698
<i>but with a profound
erotic sensitivity.</i>

616
01:03:12,247 --> 01:03:15,035
<i>But why was there
so much loneliness</i>

617
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:17,579
<i>and childish fear
in their stillness?</i>

618
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:24,211
<i>I went out again
and knocked on the door.</i>

619
01:03:25,969 --> 01:03:31,135
<i>When Marta came to the door,
it was all still there in her eyes.</i>

620
01:03:32,976 --> 01:03:35,013
<i>Yes, she's a remarkable
little woman.</i>

621
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:39,396
<i>Or the day they'd quarreled.</i>

622
01:03:39,524 --> 01:03:41,686
<i>I picked up on it right away.</i>

623
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:43,684
<i>It hung in the air.</i>

624
01:03:43,862 --> 01:03:45,819
<i>Marta was a little quiet.</i>

625
01:03:45,989 --> 01:03:49,778
<i>She sat huddled on the sofa
and looked at Stig.</i>

626
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,197
<i>He talked to me the whole time,</i>

627
01:03:52,329 --> 01:03:54,571
<i>but it was just nervous chatter.</i>

628
01:03:55,123 --> 01:03:57,740
<i>He got up to get the cognac,</i>

629
01:03:57,876 --> 01:04:00,584
<i>but on the way back
he passed Marta.</i>

630
01:04:00,754 --> 01:04:04,168
<i>He climbed on the sofa,
they looked at one another,</i>

631
01:04:04,341 --> 01:04:07,425
<i>and Stig suddenly said,
"Hey, little girl!"</i>

632
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:10,924
<i>That seemed to break the spell,</i>

633
01:04:11,139 --> 01:04:13,472
<i>because the strained
atmosphere vanished</i>

634
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:16,475
<i>like a puff of wind
over the open sea.</i>

635
01:04:16,811 --> 01:04:20,100
<i>I don't know why.
I can't tell you.</i>

636
01:04:20,732 --> 01:04:25,648
<i>Imagine trying to decipher
the complicated secret language</i>

637
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:29,109
<i>that two lovers develop
and speak, unhindered,</i>

638
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:33,242
<i>to conceal their most secret
and fragile emotions.</i>

639
01:04:34,412 --> 01:04:37,530
<i>Depicting a single day
in their lives</i>

640
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:41,496
<i>would fill many shelves
with large volumes.</i>

641
01:04:41,753 --> 01:04:44,245
<i>Thank God that's not my job.</i>

642
01:04:44,506 --> 01:04:46,543
<i>I have only to reproduce</i>

643
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:51,177
<i>what the great composers
created in truth and spirit.</i>

644
01:04:52,055 --> 01:04:54,092
That's my pleasure...

645
01:04:55,183 --> 01:04:57,766
and no one can take it from me.

646
01:05:09,989 --> 01:05:13,824
- I'm a very rich woman.
- You never told me.

647
01:05:13,993 --> 01:05:16,235
I have you and the kids,

648
01:05:16,413 --> 01:05:19,076
and old Sönderby
snoring over there.

649
01:05:19,249 --> 01:05:22,117
And it's summer,
and the sun is shining...

650
01:05:22,419 --> 01:05:24,251
and we have no worries.

651
01:05:24,421 --> 01:05:26,333
And we're all hale and hearty.

652
01:05:26,548 --> 01:05:29,461
For a moment I thought
you'd won the lottery.

653
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:33,131
This is more than I thought
any person could have.

654
01:05:33,304 --> 01:05:35,921
Of course. You're a woman.

655
01:05:36,099 --> 01:05:37,931
It's different for you.

656
01:05:38,143 --> 01:05:39,930
You think so?

657
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:42,557
I can also worry and think...

658
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:45,643
"Is this what
my whole life will be like?

659
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:48,939
Small concerns, small joys,
small tribulations?

660
01:05:49,112 --> 01:05:52,150
Nothing to sweep me
off my feet?"

661
01:05:52,449 --> 01:05:57,240
But I deserve a spanking
for such a horrible thought, don't I?

662
01:05:57,537 --> 01:05:59,529
I think it's to your credit.

663
01:05:59,706 --> 01:06:04,326
Nowhere is it written that a person
should be content, much less happy.

664
01:06:04,461 --> 01:06:05,952
Stig?

665
01:06:06,129 --> 01:06:08,542
It's time we got going

666
01:06:08,756 --> 01:06:11,590
if we're going
to make that concert.

667
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:16,091
How's the work going
on the Beethoven concerto?

668
01:06:16,264 --> 01:06:19,723
- Not well. Why?
- Yet you keep at it.

669
01:06:19,893 --> 01:06:23,352
- What of it?
- Give up the idea of being a soloist.

670
01:06:23,521 --> 01:06:25,979
Settle for being
a good orchestra player.

671
01:06:26,107 --> 01:06:28,144
I didn't ask for your advice.

672
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:30,142
Fair enough.

673
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:32,562
There's just so little time.

674
01:06:32,739 --> 01:06:37,609
I'm going to take time off
and study with Professor Sabaska.

675
01:06:37,869 --> 01:06:41,203
I've written to him.
- Pride, pure and simple.

676
01:06:41,372 --> 01:06:44,911
Just because you're an old failure
doesn't mean I have to be.

677
01:06:45,168 --> 01:06:47,785
The world
needs us second-raters too.

678
01:06:47,962 --> 01:06:50,875
No worker bees, no beehive.

679
01:06:51,132 --> 01:06:53,294
It's awful hearing you talk.

680
01:06:53,426 --> 01:06:55,588
Like listening
to the already deceased.

681
01:07:52,485 --> 01:07:54,602
I said not to come here.

682
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:57,354
Our relationship
is nothing to advertise.

683
01:07:57,574 --> 01:08:00,237
I've told Mikael I love you.

684
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:06,284
I wish I could leave you,
but I just can't seem to.

685
01:08:07,375 --> 01:08:11,085
Come on.
We can't sit here all night.

686
01:08:17,010 --> 01:08:18,672
Listen to this:

687
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:22,884
"Everything is part
of what is called spiritual science.

688
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:25,682
This may include the self, society,

689
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:28,553
state, morals, or religion.

690
01:08:28,730 --> 01:08:31,814
It's all just an intellectual game

691
01:08:31,983 --> 01:08:36,444
with expressions one uses
as if denoting something real."

692
01:08:36,821 --> 01:08:40,861
He's on the money, this Hägerström.
He has my complete sympathy.

693
01:08:40,992 --> 01:08:43,279
Mine too,
but I don't give a damn.

694
01:08:43,453 --> 01:08:45,445
I think Stig's tired tonight.

695
01:08:45,997 --> 01:08:48,705
- What's that?
- Our lodger.

696
01:08:48,875 --> 01:08:51,868
It's awful,
but we need the money.

697
01:08:53,296 --> 01:08:56,630
Evening!
So you're not in bed yet?

698
01:08:56,883 --> 01:08:59,375
I had a bite to eat at the Grand.

699
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:02,048
Hello there.
I didn't know you lived here.

700
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:05,298
Didn't use to, but I do now.

701
01:09:05,516 --> 01:09:07,178
As of yesterday.

702
01:09:12,273 --> 01:09:16,813
So you move in these circles.

703
01:09:16,944 --> 01:09:18,606
I didn't know that.

704
01:10:25,555 --> 01:10:27,547
<i>...winds variable at first,</i>

705
01:10:27,682 --> 01:10:29,924
<i>and then primarily from the north.</i>

706
01:10:30,059 --> 01:10:33,143
<i>Partly cloudy,
with thundershowers.</i>

707
01:10:33,396 --> 01:10:35,262
<i>Somewhat cooler...</i>

708
01:11:57,188 --> 01:12:00,522
I have to ask you something:
Can we move into town?

709
01:12:00,650 --> 01:12:03,313
Right away.
As soon as possible.

710
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:21,535
Did you and the kids
have to move into town too?

711
01:12:21,671 --> 01:12:24,163
You had it so good
in the country.

712
01:12:25,258 --> 01:12:27,295
Why don't you answer?

713
01:12:39,564 --> 01:12:42,181
Why are you treating me
like a criminal?

714
01:12:43,192 --> 01:12:45,434
Sabaska hasn't replied yet.

715
01:12:45,611 --> 01:12:47,227
You're hurting me.

716
01:12:47,405 --> 01:12:51,024
- Maybe you or Sönderby wrote to him.
- You're mad. Let me go!

717
01:12:53,119 --> 01:12:55,782
Oh, look.
Your teddy bear is torn.

718
01:12:55,955 --> 01:12:58,242
Don't worry.
I'll sew him up tomorrow.

719
01:12:58,416 --> 01:13:00,533
It'll just take a second.

720
01:13:02,378 --> 01:13:05,997
We said no fighting in front of the kids.
Remember that.

721
01:13:06,173 --> 01:13:09,712
Whatever happens,
no fighting in front of the kids.

722
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:37,278
Don't turn the light out.

723
01:13:37,997 --> 01:13:40,705
Mommy, you can't.

724
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:58,465
- What time is it?
- 10:30.

725
01:14:03,648 --> 01:14:06,265
The fog will be awful tonight.

726
01:14:06,901 --> 01:14:08,187
Sounds like it.

727
01:14:08,819 --> 01:14:10,936
Remember what Sönderby said?

728
01:14:11,072 --> 01:14:14,281
"Sounds like a bunch of cows
in a freight car."

729
01:14:38,391 --> 01:14:39,677
What's this?

730
01:14:39,809 --> 01:14:42,472
I don't like you
looking at me like that,

731
01:14:42,812 --> 01:14:44,804
like you're comparing.

732
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:47,267
Maybe I am.

733
01:14:58,077 --> 01:15:00,820
Can't we be nice
to each other again?

734
01:15:01,622 --> 01:15:04,990
Why can't we talk
about anything anymore?

735
01:15:05,626 --> 01:15:07,663
It's not worth the effort.

736
01:15:40,536 --> 01:15:43,449
No, leave me alone.
It's disgusting.

737
01:15:43,622 --> 01:15:47,366
I can't help it.
I think it's revolting!

738
01:15:54,884 --> 01:15:57,467
Stop blubbering.
No one can hear you.

739
01:15:59,930 --> 01:16:01,592
I've tried.

740
01:16:02,933 --> 01:16:05,391
I've done my best.

741
01:16:06,395 --> 01:16:09,638
I've never accused you or blamed you.

742
01:16:11,025 --> 01:16:14,609
I've always tried to understand you.

743
01:16:16,739 --> 01:16:18,731
So it's my fault?

744
01:16:18,908 --> 01:16:20,945
I've never asked questions.

745
01:16:21,118 --> 01:16:23,861
Why ask questions
about what doesn't concern you?

746
01:16:25,206 --> 01:16:28,574
- You and Nelly doesn't concern me?
- Not really.

747
01:16:28,751 --> 01:16:32,495
Keep your moral indignation to yourself.
I'm not interested.

748
01:16:32,671 --> 01:16:33,912
Why?

749
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:38,755
If you're not careful, you step
in dog shit and can't shake it off.

750
01:16:39,929 --> 01:16:41,670
How dare you!

751
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:44,430
You're one to talk.

752
01:16:44,767 --> 01:16:47,225
Before we met,
there were men all around you.

753
01:16:47,394 --> 01:16:50,432
You were even
with that revolting Marcel.

754
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:54,190
That was before the kids.
Don't they mean anything?

755
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:57,444
There were others before them,
but you got rid of them.

756
01:16:57,613 --> 01:17:00,947
Now I'm sorry I insisted
when you didn't want children.

757
01:17:01,117 --> 01:17:03,279
You see?

758
01:17:04,286 --> 01:17:05,902
Yes, I see.

759
01:17:06,122 --> 01:17:08,205
I see what we've become.

760
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:15,037
I know what the problem is.

761
01:17:15,339 --> 01:17:18,002
We both think
life has passed us by.

762
01:17:18,134 --> 01:17:21,093
We've both been struck
by a moment of clarity...

763
01:17:21,220 --> 01:17:23,803
and with clarity comes disgust.

764
01:17:23,973 --> 01:17:25,965
It's a natural consequence.

765
01:17:26,517 --> 01:17:30,136
We've argued and been nasty
to each other before,

766
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:34,439
but we just had to reach out,
and it was fine again.

767
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:36,983
It was a great sense of security.

768
01:17:37,236 --> 01:17:40,695
Now we've discovered
there's no such thing as security.

769
01:17:40,865 --> 01:17:44,859
Remember what you said here
our first night together?

770
01:17:45,327 --> 01:17:49,196
The main thing is
to become a real person.

771
01:17:49,373 --> 01:17:51,535
We said a lot of things back then.

772
01:17:51,709 --> 01:17:54,326
- It was the truth.
- It was all lies.

773
01:17:55,171 --> 01:17:58,414
That morning I came home
with my hand cut,

774
01:17:58,591 --> 01:18:00,753
that's when my clarity began.

775
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:04,799
It was so unbearable that
I put my hand through a window

776
01:18:04,930 --> 01:18:08,139
so I'd give up my dream
of being a soloist.

777
01:18:08,767 --> 01:18:12,636
I stood there with a bloody hand
and thought how stupid I was.

778
01:18:12,813 --> 01:18:15,647
"Why doesn't someone laugh
at this second-rate musician

779
01:18:15,816 --> 01:18:18,354
who won't accept his mediocrity?"

780
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:22,362
Me, me, me!
Can't you hear how pitiful you sound?

781
01:18:22,489 --> 01:18:25,482
My apologies.
We won't talk about it again.

782
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:33,620
I'll go to Grandmother's.
It's better for the kids there too.

783
01:18:33,751 --> 01:18:36,289
- Where will you get the money?
- From you.

784
01:18:36,462 --> 01:18:38,920
- I don't have any.
- That's strange.

785
01:18:39,048 --> 01:18:42,541
- I gave it to you last week.
- For phone and rent.

786
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:45,711
- There was always enough before.
- You want to see receipts?

787
01:18:45,888 --> 01:18:49,882
- You never set anything aside.
- Get an advance like everyone else.

788
01:18:50,059 --> 01:18:51,516
I already did.

789
01:18:51,644 --> 01:18:53,931
You must have other expenses...

790
01:18:54,063 --> 01:18:57,272
- It's my money!
- Not when it's for the household.

791
01:18:57,399 --> 01:19:01,359
In any case, I have no money
for your hastily planned trip.

792
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:05,780
We're poor and can't afford
expenses of an emotional nature.

793
01:19:05,908 --> 01:19:08,742
- And the money you give to Nelly?
- Shut up!

794
01:19:08,911 --> 01:19:11,699
- What kind of tone is that?
- It's just like yours!

795
01:19:11,830 --> 01:19:15,915
- A mistress costs money.
- A fixed rate is more honest.

796
01:19:16,168 --> 01:19:19,457
- You're so crude.
- And you're so sensitive.

797
01:19:19,588 --> 01:19:22,581
Must have been hard
with someone like Marcel.

798
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:24,841
How can you have
a lover anyway?

799
01:19:24,969 --> 01:19:27,256
You perform
the bare minimum required.

800
01:19:27,388 --> 01:19:29,505
- That's your fault.
- Of course.

801
01:19:29,682 --> 01:19:32,470
I was naïve to expect fidelity.
- Stop it, Marta.

802
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:35,344
You need an outlet
for your artistic temperament.

803
01:19:35,479 --> 01:19:38,267
Nelly's better at nurturing
your misunderstood genius.

804
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:40,477
Can't be easy for the poor girl!

805
01:19:50,953 --> 01:19:53,616
Forgive me, Marta.
Forgive me.

806
01:20:02,715 --> 01:20:06,208
The last part was my fault.
I'm to blame.

807
01:20:06,343 --> 01:20:08,255
Forgive me anyway.

808
01:20:09,013 --> 01:20:11,130
But I won't forgive the rest.

809
01:20:12,224 --> 01:20:14,807
I'll find the money for the trip

810
01:20:14,977 --> 01:20:18,436
if I have to beg for it
in the streets.

811
01:20:18,564 --> 01:20:20,521
Don't touch me!

812
01:20:20,941 --> 01:20:24,810
You disgust me so much,
I'd like to spit in your face!

813
01:20:24,987 --> 01:20:26,603
Fine.

814
01:20:26,822 --> 01:20:29,781
If that's how you want it.

815
01:20:30,242 --> 01:20:35,112
I'll ask Sönderby for the money.
It'll be nice to be rid of you.

816
01:20:47,009 --> 01:20:50,218
"The doctor says it's a stroke,

817
01:20:50,471 --> 01:20:53,384
but I know Nelly poisoned me."

818
01:21:09,031 --> 01:21:12,024
- Do you think he's suffering?
- Probably.

819
01:21:12,201 --> 01:21:13,658
Good.

820
01:21:13,786 --> 01:21:16,779
I hope he's in such pain
he can't stop screaming.

821
01:21:16,955 --> 01:21:19,789
He can't scream.
He's paralyzed.

822
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:22,367
That's the best part.

823
01:21:23,170 --> 01:21:25,537
You must hate him.

824
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:28,332
He'll be dead soon.

825
01:21:29,426 --> 01:21:31,884
Sometimes it's like a dream.

826
01:21:33,722 --> 01:21:35,714
I'm scared of him.

827
01:21:36,225 --> 01:21:40,219
Sometimes at night I think
he'll come beat me or strangle me.

828
01:21:40,604 --> 01:21:43,893
I almost believe
you really did poison him.

829
01:21:44,483 --> 01:21:47,226
I often thought I should.

830
01:21:48,153 --> 01:21:50,065
What's he done to you?

831
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:52,231
What's he done to me?

832
01:21:52,366 --> 01:21:56,030
He just exists.
I'm dependent on him.

833
01:21:57,037 --> 01:21:59,825
I don't know.
- You can divorce him.

834
01:22:01,125 --> 01:22:03,162
Where would I go?

835
01:22:03,710 --> 01:22:05,576
No one cares about me.

836
01:22:05,712 --> 01:22:09,672
Because you're so damned nasty
and lack any human emotions.

837
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:16,217
I think it's cold.

838
01:22:17,182 --> 01:22:19,094
It's 13 below.

839
01:22:22,521 --> 01:22:26,265
You go in.
He can't stand the sight of me.

840
01:22:47,254 --> 01:22:49,917
What's wrong with you?
Hung over?

841
01:22:50,048 --> 01:22:52,290
Is there nothing else on
besides organ music?

842
01:22:52,468 --> 01:22:54,255
Mikael likes it.

843
01:22:54,803 --> 01:22:57,466
You shouldn't drink like that.

844
01:22:57,639 --> 01:22:59,631
"You shouldn't drink like that."

845
01:22:59,808 --> 01:23:02,300
If you weren't so stupid,

846
01:23:02,478 --> 01:23:04,970
I might point out
that I'm always smartly dressed.

847
01:23:05,147 --> 01:23:08,857
- And so?
- Take that idiot Stig. How he suffers!

848
01:23:09,026 --> 01:23:11,484
He thinks life is terrible
and you're disgusting.

849
01:23:11,612 --> 01:23:14,855
He's washed up
and can't face his own failure.

850
01:23:15,115 --> 01:23:19,075
That's why he cheats on his wife
and runs around disheveled and dirty.

851
01:23:19,203 --> 01:23:22,571
- He's in there with Mikael.
- So let him hear!

852
01:23:23,248 --> 01:23:24,989
I drink, you say?

853
01:23:25,167 --> 01:23:27,284
I do my job.
I'm handsome and well-behaved.

854
01:23:27,461 --> 01:23:30,920
I'm polite and friendly,
and I live my life!

855
01:23:31,798 --> 01:23:34,506
And in the meantime,
I'm damned happy.

856
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:38,386
I think I'll go in and sleep.

857
01:23:38,514 --> 01:23:41,177
It's all one can do on a Sunday.

858
01:23:43,352 --> 01:23:44,968
You coming?

859
01:23:51,109 --> 01:23:55,228
"I'm a bastard,
and I've gotten what I deserve.

860
01:23:55,364 --> 01:23:58,323
But you better watch out, Stig."

861
01:24:00,327 --> 01:24:04,196
Mikael, I'm leaving now
and never coming back.

862
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:08,409
I'm grateful for everything
you taught me, but I can't stay.

863
01:24:08,544 --> 01:24:11,378
I don't want to be like you three.

864
01:24:12,047 --> 01:24:15,085
Only one person can help me,
and that's Marta.

865
01:24:29,565 --> 01:24:32,524
<i>Dear Marta,
I'm sure you're surprised</i>

866
01:24:32,651 --> 01:24:35,644
<i>after not hearing from me
for three months.</i>

867
01:24:35,779 --> 01:24:39,523
<i>I had to write because things
have happened to me.</i>

868
01:24:39,950 --> 01:24:43,193
<i>It's as if I suddenly understood
what a fool I've been.</i>

869
01:24:43,579 --> 01:24:48,370
<i>I realize how I've squandered
the only thing of value in life.</i>

870
01:24:51,086 --> 01:24:55,547
<i>Dear Stig, when I got your letter,
I was very worried at first.</i>

871
01:24:55,716 --> 01:24:58,379
<i>I could feel how alone you've been,</i>

872
01:24:58,552 --> 01:25:01,169
<i>and how hard it's been
in many ways.</i>

873
01:25:01,430 --> 01:25:04,298
<i>I reread your letter many times,</i>

874
01:25:04,433 --> 01:25:07,471
<i>and I could sense that
something important has happened.</i>

875
01:25:08,020 --> 01:25:10,478
<i>I too have been thinking,</i>

876
01:25:10,606 --> 01:25:13,189
<i>and now I know
we'll never get divorced.</i>

877
01:25:13,317 --> 01:25:15,525
<i>That would be a terrible mistake.</i>

878
01:25:15,652 --> 01:25:19,771
<i>And though I won't be coming home,
I long foryou.</i>

879
01:25:20,282 --> 01:25:22,319
<i>My dearest darling Marta,</i>

880
01:25:22,618 --> 01:25:27,158
<i>your words made me so happy
I almost started to cry.</i>

881
01:25:27,497 --> 01:25:29,614
<i>One hides so many feelings.</i>

882
01:25:29,791 --> 01:25:34,411
<i>I did with you and the kids,
because it hurt too much,</i>

883
01:25:34,838 --> 01:25:39,003
<i>or maybe I didn't understand
how much all of you mean to me.</i>

884
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:42,127
<i>I want you to come get us soon.</i>

885
01:25:42,304 --> 01:25:46,469
<i>There's so much to plan
for the summer, isn't there?</i>

886
01:25:46,808 --> 01:25:49,972
<i>Darling, writing feels
so strange and stupid.</i>

887
01:25:50,145 --> 01:25:52,387
<i>There's so much I'd like to say,</i>

888
01:25:52,522 --> 01:25:54,980
<i>but it looks silly
and sentimental on paper.</i>

889
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:57,233
<i>I've tried, believe me.</i>

890
01:25:57,402 --> 01:26:01,112
<i>By the way, we don't need
to talk when we meet.</i>

891
01:26:01,239 --> 01:26:04,448
<i>I know just how to show you
what you mean to me.</i>

892
01:26:04,576 --> 01:26:06,192
<i>Can you guess?</i>

893
01:26:06,328 --> 01:26:07,944
<i>Come soon...</i>

894
01:26:16,296 --> 01:26:20,757
<i>This train is so slow!
I'd like to jump off and run alongside it.</i>

895
01:26:20,884 --> 01:26:23,843
<i>Maybe I'd help it up the hill.</i>

896
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:28,424
<i>It'll be so strange
to hear her say...</i>

897
01:26:28,725 --> 01:26:31,092
<i>"You can be so silly sometimes,"</i>

898
01:26:31,269 --> 01:26:34,683
<i>or "You sure you washed
your ears properly?"</i>

899
01:26:34,856 --> 01:26:38,896
<i>Or to sit in the kitchen after a concert
and eat right from the cupboard,</i>

900
01:26:39,069 --> 01:26:43,860
<i>drinking vodka and joking
and not saying a serious word.</i>

901
01:26:46,201 --> 01:26:47,863
<i>Quite pretty.</i>

902
01:26:47,994 --> 01:26:49,576
<i>And I'm so tan.</i>

903
01:26:49,746 --> 01:26:53,035
<i>And you can't tell
I didn't sleep last night.</i>

904
01:26:53,375 --> 01:26:56,789
<i>Silly girl!
I'm just going to meet my husband.</i>

905
01:26:56,962 --> 01:26:58,999
<i>We got fed up with each other,</i>

906
01:26:59,131 --> 01:27:01,874
<i>yet now everything is new... new!</i>

907
01:27:02,134 --> 01:27:04,251
<i>Newly cleansed and polished.</i>

908
01:27:04,428 --> 01:27:06,590
<i>How fun it will be to cook again,</i>

909
01:27:06,763 --> 01:27:10,848
<i>to be master of my own kitchen,
to sleep in our own bed.</i>

910
01:27:10,976 --> 01:27:14,390
<i>To feel his warmth
as he sleeps beside me.</i>

911
01:27:14,563 --> 01:27:16,725
<i>Never to be alone again.</i>

912
01:27:16,898 --> 01:27:18,685
<i>Never again.</i>

913
01:27:20,986 --> 01:27:24,525
<i>That mouth of hers,
so delicious and soft to kiss.</i>

914
01:27:24,906 --> 01:27:29,071
<i>I love her body too.
The smooth skin of her shoulders.</i>

915
01:27:29,244 --> 01:27:32,032
<i>Her breasts that never
recovered from the kids</i>

916
01:27:32,205 --> 01:27:35,414
<i>but are so sensitive,
like living beings.</i>

917
01:27:35,709 --> 01:27:37,792
<i>The fine hair on her neck,</i>

918
01:27:37,919 --> 01:27:40,582
<i>the soft curves of her belly,</i>

919
01:27:40,756 --> 01:27:44,875
<i>her waist so narrow
I can wrap my hands around it.</i>

920
01:27:45,594 --> 01:27:49,838
<i>I love her because we've struck
each other and hurt each other,</i>

921
01:27:50,223 --> 01:27:52,465
<i>but also for the thousand nights</i>

922
01:27:52,601 --> 01:27:55,264
<i>of joy and utter pleasure
we've shared.</i>

923
01:28:55,163 --> 01:28:56,904
SOME YEARS LATER

924
01:28:58,041 --> 01:29:01,000
You've been naughty,
so you can't come

925
01:29:01,127 --> 01:29:05,121
when we go see Grandmother.

926
01:29:09,886 --> 01:29:12,754
We'll catch really big fish,

927
01:29:12,889 --> 01:29:18,101
and I'll keep one in the bathtub
and teach it how to talk.

928
01:29:18,353 --> 01:29:20,345
Fish can't talk.

929
01:29:20,522 --> 01:29:22,184
You can teach them.

930
01:29:22,399 --> 01:29:24,686
Mom, Lasse's lying!

931
01:29:24,985 --> 01:29:27,398
Stig, would you call for a taxi?

932
01:29:35,787 --> 01:29:38,325
Dad, Lasse's lying.

933
01:29:38,498 --> 01:29:41,206
No, he's just making things up.

934
01:29:43,169 --> 01:29:47,288
Why shouldn't a fish be able to talk?
You never know.

935
01:29:47,507 --> 01:29:51,547
Could you send a taxi
to Prästgatan 7B?

936
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:54,007
Ericsson.

937
01:29:54,139 --> 01:29:57,257
Miss! It has to be big.

938
01:29:57,392 --> 01:30:01,306
There are four people
and lots of bags and stuff.

939
01:30:01,730 --> 01:30:03,392
That's right.

940
01:30:03,565 --> 01:30:05,306
What do you want?

941
01:30:05,483 --> 01:30:07,566
Ask Sönderby over this evening.

942
01:30:07,694 --> 01:30:09,902
There's mineral water in the fridge.

943
01:30:10,530 --> 01:30:12,396
I'm going to be lonely.

944
01:30:12,532 --> 01:30:14,694
No, you're not.

945
01:30:14,868 --> 01:30:16,530
You'll be just fine.

946
01:30:16,661 --> 01:30:18,402
Thanks very much.

947
01:30:20,957 --> 01:30:24,416
The kids can go on their own.
You should stay with me.

948
01:30:24,586 --> 01:30:27,249
You're silly.
What would Grandmother say?

949
01:30:27,547 --> 01:30:30,961
You're taking enough stuff
to last till Judgment Day.

950
01:30:31,134 --> 01:30:34,798
You needn't come to the station.
I can get a porter.

951
01:30:36,598 --> 01:30:40,888
- What's this? A bomb?
- No, it's a kerosene stove.

952
01:30:41,102 --> 01:30:44,220
- You're taking a stove?
- Yes, it's better that way.

953
01:30:44,397 --> 01:30:46,810
We'll cook our own meals
in the cottage

954
01:30:46,942 --> 01:30:48,808
and not bother the old folks.

955
01:30:50,111 --> 01:30:51,818
Go ahead and sigh,

956
01:30:51,947 --> 01:30:54,940
but you'll approve
when you come join us.

957
01:31:00,914 --> 01:31:04,874
- You need a haircut.
- It's awful. Hair gets all over everything.

958
01:31:05,043 --> 01:31:08,502
- If you came along, I could cut it.
- I'll be along later.

959
01:31:08,630 --> 01:31:11,998
- Strange how I always miss you.
- What's strange about that?

960
01:31:12,175 --> 01:31:14,167
We've been married so long.

961
01:31:14,344 --> 01:31:16,961
Lasse, don't lick the window.
It's dirty.

962
01:31:17,305 --> 01:31:19,297
You'll have nice weather.

963
01:31:19,432 --> 01:31:21,640
Looks like spring's coming.

964
01:31:23,353 --> 01:31:26,846
- Won't this train ever leave?
- Anxious to get rid of us?

965
01:31:26,982 --> 01:31:30,350
It just always feels so silly
standing on the platform.

966
01:31:31,945 --> 01:31:33,811
Good-bye.

967
01:31:38,410 --> 01:31:41,244
We'll catch a fish that can talk!

968
01:32:58,990 --> 01:33:01,277
I heard what happened.

969
01:33:02,035 --> 01:33:04,618
I'm... I mean...

970
01:33:05,413 --> 01:33:06,949
You don't...

971
01:33:07,499 --> 01:33:10,992
You don't have to come to work
if you don't want to.

972
01:33:11,127 --> 01:33:13,414
It's better to keep working.

973
01:33:13,838 --> 01:33:15,249
Very well.

974
01:33:15,882 --> 01:33:17,418
As you like.

975
01:33:17,592 --> 01:33:19,254
Don't touch me.

976
01:33:43,785 --> 01:33:48,780
The cellos and basses
should sing like blazes!

977
01:33:50,250 --> 01:33:53,368
It's about joy, you see.

978
01:33:54,212 --> 01:33:57,296
Not the joy expressed in laughter...

979
01:33:58,007 --> 01:34:01,375
or the joy that says,
"I'm happy."

980
01:34:02,303 --> 01:34:05,512
What I mean is a joy...

981
01:34:05,807 --> 01:34:08,470
so great, so special...

982
01:34:08,977 --> 01:34:13,142
that it lies beyond pain
and boundless despair.

983
01:34:13,273 --> 01:34:14,935
It's a joy...

984
01:34:15,942 --> 01:34:18,355
beyond all understanding.

985
01:34:23,408 --> 01:34:25,650
I can't explain it any better.
