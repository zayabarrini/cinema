2
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:07,444
I hope you have a nice life.

3
00:06:08,344 --> 00:06:09,810
That’s not it.

4
00:06:11,577 --> 00:06:13,210
That’s...Not it!

5
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,944
That’s exactly it.

6
00:08:18,744 --> 00:08:20,710
Mr. Silva...

7
00:08:21,344 --> 00:08:23,377
May I have a word with you please?

8
00:08:23,477 --> 00:08:25,410
Come in, Francisco.

9
00:08:29,177 --> 00:08:30,310
Pardon me...

10
00:08:33,577 --> 00:08:38,944
I’ve come to tell you that
I can’t come to work tomorrow.

11
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:43,410
And you tell me now?

12
00:08:43,844 --> 00:08:46,377
I’m going to have to dock you a day.

13
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:50,177
I know...Thank you very much.

14
00:08:50,644 --> 00:08:53,444
Don’t thank me.
I haven’t agreed yet.

15
00:08:57,444 --> 00:09:01,710
I need you to take some sand
down for me. Everyone else is busy.

16
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:05,177
Mr. Silva, I have something to take
care of, I can’t tomorrow.

17
00:09:05,277 --> 00:09:07,877
And I have five truckload
of sand to deliver.

18
00:09:07,977 --> 00:09:11,310
You’ll do it in two hours
and then you can go.

19
00:09:12,244 --> 00:09:14,810
In the afternoon then.
I can’t in the morning.

20
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:18,677
See if you ease your tone, Francisco.
I just gave you the day off.

21
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:23,644
With five truckloads of sand...

22
00:09:25,177 --> 00:09:28,510
Don’t forget to fill out
the form for the day off.

23
00:10:08,444 --> 00:10:10,377
Will you open?

24
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:26,644
Weren’t you in...?

25
00:10:26,744 --> 00:10:28,177
I returned...

26
00:10:29,244 --> 00:10:31,544
I sent you a postcard,
didn’t you get it?

27
00:10:34,844 --> 00:10:36,777
Don’t you check the mailbox?

28
00:10:37,277 --> 00:10:38,544
What for?

29
00:10:38,944 --> 00:10:41,277
Every time I check it
I only find bills to pay.

30
00:10:41,377 --> 00:10:43,610
Now I only check it at
the end of the month.

31
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,844
If you sent something
it should be there.

32
00:10:48,477 --> 00:10:50,544
What is this supposed to mean?

33
00:10:51,677 --> 00:10:52,977
What?

34
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:56,577
This?

35
00:10:57,777 --> 00:10:59,977
That I just need a drink.

36
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:10,910
It’s getting dark.

37
00:11:14,977 --> 00:11:16,910
It’s getting dark.

38
00:11:23,477 --> 00:11:26,710
You didn’t hear what I said?
It’s getting dark out.

39
00:12:31,377 --> 00:12:34,510
All she ever showed me
was unhappiness.

40
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:40,944
But she must have been happy.

41
00:12:42,244 --> 00:12:44,277
Always happy.

42
00:12:47,944 --> 00:12:51,777
There’re those who limit
themselves to exist, just that.

43
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:56,477
You can choose.

44
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:59,644
Take whatever you’d like.

45
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:03,277
Where to?

46
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:05,444
What do I know.

47
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:08,577
To your life.

48
00:13:10,677 --> 00:13:13,777
Couldn’t you’ve called a moving truck?

49
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:20,344
I liked to look at things over and
over as if it were the first time.

50
00:13:21,277 --> 00:13:25,210
We spend our lives running
from one thing to another.

51
00:13:25,477 --> 00:13:29,577
Always passing by the same objects
and using them.

52
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:33,977
And we are very surprised
that they still exist.

53
00:13:34,644 --> 00:13:37,977
But it would be better
if they were a novelty.

54
00:13:39,844 --> 00:13:41,644
But they aren’t.

55
00:13:43,344 --> 00:13:46,244
We try, but they aren’t.

56
00:13:47,544 --> 00:13:52,610
This is a process that destroys,
tires, weighs…

57
00:13:53,677 --> 00:13:58,477
The best thing to do is to give up,
it’s one way to solve things.

58
00:13:58,577 --> 00:14:01,777
I already said: it’s all yours.

59
00:14:02,977 --> 00:14:05,210
Those people there...

60
00:14:05,877 --> 00:14:08,877
What? They’re my things aren’t they?

61
00:14:08,977 --> 00:14:13,377
They thought they’d already seen everything here,
but they hadn’t seen this yet!

62
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:15,710
Don’t say that, please.

63
00:15:28,944 --> 00:15:31,477
I’ll stay with you.

64
00:15:51,177 --> 00:15:52,877
Are you ok?

65
00:15:52,977 --> 00:15:54,477
Yes.

66
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,977
You don’t have anything
in the fridge.

67
00:15:57,009 --> 00:15:58,609
I don’t need anything.

68
00:15:59,677 --> 00:16:02,644
I’ll go to the supermarket
in the afternoon.

69
00:16:02,744 --> 00:16:04,510
Will you take me?

70
00:16:05,444 --> 00:16:07,277
I can’t.

71
00:16:11,377 --> 00:16:13,544
I’ll go pick you up.

72
00:16:25,377 --> 00:16:29,444
It’s the middle of the week...
It’s a work day.

73
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:32,777
It’s my day off.

74
00:16:33,177 --> 00:16:36,410
I go by there in the afternoon
but I won't take long.

75
00:20:31,277 --> 00:20:33,744
So where were you exactly?

76
00:20:33,877 --> 00:20:35,677
In Acapulco.

76
00:20:36,305 --> 00:21:36,578
