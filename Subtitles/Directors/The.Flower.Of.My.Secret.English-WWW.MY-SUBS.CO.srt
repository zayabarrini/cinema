1
00:00:15,108 --> 00:00:17,108
The Flower of My Secret

2
00:00:34,108 --> 00:00:37,483
We've done everything possible,
but your son Juan is dead.

3
00:00:37,733 --> 00:00:41,150
But I just saw him,
and he was breathing.

4
00:00:41,192 --> 00:00:43,942
You might have made a mistake.

5
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:46,525
- Not this time.
- I want to see him.

6
00:00:46,733 --> 00:00:49,358
You will, but first
we must warn you…

7
00:00:49,567 --> 00:00:52,108
…not to have false hopes.

8
00:00:52,108 --> 00:00:56,150
It'll look like he's breathing,
but he's not.

9
00:00:56,733 --> 00:00:59,150
It's the artificial-respiration machine.

10
00:01:01,192 --> 00:01:04,567
If you don't mind,
I'll take him somewhere else.

11
00:01:04,817 --> 00:01:08,067
I'll get the money somewhere.
If there's hope--

12
00:01:08,108 --> 00:01:10,067
There isn't.

13
00:01:12,942 --> 00:01:16,150
It's hard to grasp cerebral death.

14
00:01:16,192 --> 00:01:19,275
We have him on an artificial
respirator. That's why…

15
00:01:19,442 --> 00:01:21,233
…he seems to be breathing.

16
00:01:21,233 --> 00:01:23,317
But his brain is dead.

17
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,900
But my Juan is so strong.

18
00:01:27,108 --> 00:01:29,108
He's only 16 years old.

19
00:01:29,275 --> 00:01:34,442
If you say he's breathing,
maybe he really is breathing.

20
00:01:34,775 --> 00:01:37,233
Like we told you,
it's the respirator.

21
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,233
Sorry, I don't trust--

22
00:01:39,442 --> 00:01:42,983
Unfortunately, we have
unequivocal proof.

23
00:01:44,733 --> 00:01:47,567
Juan's last brain scan
was completely flat.

24
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:50,483
That means cerebral death.

25
00:01:52,067 --> 00:01:56,442
I don't mind him being a little
retarded as long as he survives.

26
00:01:56,858 --> 00:02:00,192
Madam, your son is dead.

27
00:02:02,525 --> 00:02:04,358
He's dead.

28
00:02:06,858 --> 00:02:08,525
Shall we notify your relatives?

29
00:02:11,775 --> 00:02:15,233
I'm alone.
My husband died two years ago.

30
00:02:16,067 --> 00:02:18,525
I don't want you
to call my mother-in-law.

31
00:02:18,733 --> 00:02:23,150
Why did she buy him
that motorcycle?

32
00:02:23,192 --> 00:02:24,983
That goddamn motorcycle.

33
00:02:25,192 --> 00:02:27,067
I warned him about it

34
00:02:27,275 --> 00:02:30,942
"Remember, you'll ruin my life
if something happens on that bike!"

35
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,650
These things happen every day.

36
00:02:34,275 --> 00:02:35,775
Every day?

37
00:02:35,983 --> 00:02:38,525
I don't lose a son every day.

38
00:02:42,525 --> 00:02:44,442
Swear it.

39
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,358
What?

40
00:02:47,317 --> 00:02:49,733
Swear that my Juan is dead.

41
00:02:50,233 --> 00:02:53,775
No one has ever
asked us to do that.

42
00:02:53,983 --> 00:02:55,692
Don't judge her.

43
00:02:56,525 --> 00:02:58,858
Yes, ma'am, we swear it.

44
00:02:59,025 --> 00:03:01,442
Your son is dead.

45
00:04:23,525 --> 00:04:26,108
<i>--defenseless against
the lurking madness.</i>

46
00:04:55,067 --> 00:04:57,983
<i>Every day I wear something
of yours.</i>

47
00:04:58,192 --> 00:05:00,525
<i>Today I'm wearing
the boots you gave me.</i>

48
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:02,858
<i>Remember how you had
to take them off…</i>

49
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,942
<i>…because I couldn't do it alone?</i>

50
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:09,483
<i>Seeing them reminded me of you,
and I put them on in your honor.</i>

51
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,942
<i>Now they're too tight.</i>

52
00:05:11,983 --> 00:05:14,525
<i>Sometimes the memory of you…</i>

53
00:05:14,733 --> 00:05:17,483
<i>…like these boots,
oppresses my heart.</i>

54
00:05:50,108 --> 00:05:52,567
<i>I can't get them off.</i>

55
00:07:09,525 --> 00:07:11,733
Can you spare 1000 pesetas?

56
00:07:11,983 --> 00:07:14,108
- I don't have--
- Five hundred?

57
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,900
- Please, I need it.
- I don't have change.

58
00:07:18,817 --> 00:07:21,983
I'll give you 5000
if you help me take off my boots.

59
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:24,275
Deal. Sit on the steps.

60
00:07:24,483 --> 00:07:27,150
- Where?
- By the fountain.

61
00:07:27,817 --> 00:07:29,858
Come over here.

62
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,150
Sit here.

63
00:07:33,067 --> 00:07:35,525
- This one?
- That one first.

64
00:07:35,733 --> 00:07:38,817
Here we go. We'll get it off.

65
00:07:40,317 --> 00:07:41,983
It's stuck!

66
00:07:42,233 --> 00:07:43,775
You have to push.

67
00:07:43,983 --> 00:07:47,317
I can't push.
Can't you see I'll fall?

68
00:07:48,567 --> 00:07:50,775
Wait a second.

69
00:07:50,983 --> 00:07:53,067
Give me my leg back!

70
00:07:53,275 --> 00:07:56,442
Hold it here and pull on the heel…

71
00:07:56,608 --> 00:08:00,192
…not on the tip, understand?

72
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,858
- Pull here.
- This way?

73
00:08:02,067 --> 00:08:03,733
It won't budge.

74
00:08:05,275 --> 00:08:07,192
No, please!

75
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,108
Forget it.

76
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,692
Please, don't.

77
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:22,733
We'll get soaked.

78
00:08:23,025 --> 00:08:25,567
- I like rain.
- I don't.

79
00:08:25,733 --> 00:08:28,108
I'll get a friend to help me.

80
00:08:28,358 --> 00:08:30,900
No, no. I'll give you the money.

81
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:39,317
What a day.

82
00:08:39,483 --> 00:08:42,025
Coffee with cognac, please.

83
00:08:42,233 --> 00:08:44,275
Can I use the phone?

84
00:08:56,983 --> 00:08:59,108
<i>National Transplant Organization.</i>

85
00:08:59,317 --> 00:09:00,983
This is Leo, Betty's friend.

86
00:09:01,192 --> 00:09:02,608
Can I talk to her?

87
00:09:02,817 --> 00:09:06,108
<i>She's not here.
She's giving a seminar.</i>

88
00:09:06,317 --> 00:09:08,692
<i>- In Madrid or out of town?
- In Madrid.</i>

89
00:09:08,733 --> 00:09:11,567
<i>In the Community Hotel School.</i>

90
00:09:12,608 --> 00:09:14,567
As usual.

91
00:09:14,817 --> 00:09:17,483
<i>She'll probably finish late.</i>

92
00:09:17,692 --> 00:09:20,442
<i>- Shall I give her a message?
 - No, thanks.</i>

93
00:09:24,358 --> 00:09:27,733
FEELINGS: PAIN, ANGER,
IMPOTENCE, RELIEF

94
00:09:27,983 --> 00:09:31,525
BEHAVIOR: AGGRESSION,
SEARCHING, SADNESS

95
00:09:31,567 --> 00:09:35,192
Was your son concerned
with social problems?

96
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,692
I don't know.

97
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:40,650
He was going to be
a conscientious objector.

98
00:09:40,692 --> 00:09:45,150
He was against violence,
intolerance, war…

99
00:09:45,358 --> 00:09:48,567
- He cared about other people.
- Sure.

100
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:50,150
Did he talk about death?

101
00:09:50,692 --> 00:09:53,567
Why would he do that?
He was only 16 years old.

102
00:09:53,817 --> 00:09:55,608
We're asking because…

103
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:59,608
…some people decide, when they're
alive, to donate their organs…

104
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:03,525
- …and we wanted to know if Juan--
- You can do a transplant?

105
00:10:03,567 --> 00:10:05,817
There's still hope for him?

106
00:10:06,233 --> 00:10:08,817
There is hope, but not for your son.

107
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,525
For other patients.

108
00:10:10,733 --> 00:10:15,150
Your son's organs
could save many lives.

109
00:10:15,358 --> 00:10:17,983
In Juan's case,
where everything can be used…

110
00:10:18,192 --> 00:10:21,858
…given his youth and good health,
it'd save five lives.

111
00:10:22,025 --> 00:10:24,608
We'll need your authorization.

112
00:10:24,775 --> 00:10:27,192
Don't make me suffer even more.

113
00:10:27,442 --> 00:10:29,983
A woman in the waiting room
warned me about this.

114
00:10:30,275 --> 00:10:31,817
You can't mutilate my son.

115
00:10:32,067 --> 00:10:35,567
It's not a mutilation,
it's an operation. He'll look…

116
00:10:35,608 --> 00:10:37,150
…no different afterwards.

117
00:10:37,983 --> 00:10:39,650
I want to see my son.

118
00:10:40,275 --> 00:10:41,733
Think about it.

119
00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:45,525
Eighty percent of the relatives we ask
give their approval…

120
00:10:45,775 --> 00:10:48,192
…and it's a great
consolation for them.

121
00:10:48,358 --> 00:10:49,900
We have experience in this.

122
00:10:52,358 --> 00:10:54,192
Who will you give the organs to?

123
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,817
Whoever needs them most.

124
00:10:56,358 --> 00:10:58,358
You wouldn't give them to an Arab?

125
00:10:59,108 --> 00:11:02,233
To an Arab? We give them
to whoever needs them most…

126
00:11:02,483 --> 00:11:04,817
…regardless of their race or creed.

127
00:11:05,442 --> 00:11:07,650
I've read that some
really rich Arabs…

128
00:11:07,817 --> 00:11:10,608
…buy everything
on the black market.

129
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:13,483
That happens in
Third World countries.

130
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,567
Spain is in the Integrated Pain--

131
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:17,442
- Plan.
- Integrated Pain…

132
00:11:17,608 --> 00:11:20,233
- Integrated Plan.
- Integrated Plan…

133
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,067
…of Organ Donation.

134
00:11:22,275 --> 00:11:25,983
The administration is completely
on the level. Excuse me.

135
00:11:29,567 --> 00:11:31,817
Will they at least stay in Madrid?

136
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:35,483
The law doesn't allow us to say.

137
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:39,567
Well, I don't know.

138
00:11:39,775 --> 00:11:44,525
Give me a few days.
I can't think about it right now.

139
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,733
Just let me see him.

140
00:11:46,983 --> 00:11:48,483
We can't wait.

141
00:11:48,858 --> 00:11:52,483
Unfortunately, there's no time.
You have a few minutes.

142
00:11:54,233 --> 00:11:56,025
Take the time you need.

143
00:11:56,650 --> 00:12:00,567
If there's any way
we can help you, let us know.

144
00:12:00,983 --> 00:12:03,358
We're here for that too.

145
00:12:03,567 --> 00:12:05,942
Sorry, we should have
started with that.

146
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,525
It's never too late.

147
00:12:08,567 --> 00:12:10,608
Let's go.

148
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:14,692
Manuela, you were great.

149
00:12:14,983 --> 00:12:16,900
Wasn't it a bit overacted?

150
00:12:17,067 --> 00:12:20,483
Not at all. You're a
better actress each time.

151
00:12:21,025 --> 00:12:22,775
I'm going to rewind.

152
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:25,858
If you want to say anything,
I'll stop the video.

153
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:30,608
- How did you feel?
- Terrible.

154
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:33,858
Especially when she refused
to understand brain death.

155
00:12:34,067 --> 00:12:37,525
I didn't refuse.
Forget I'm a nurse.

156
00:12:37,567 --> 00:12:39,817
People don't know
what a brain scan is.

157
00:12:40,067 --> 00:12:43,608
Brain death is difficult to explain.

158
00:12:43,858 --> 00:12:46,817
The relative will be in a crisis…

159
00:12:47,275 --> 00:12:51,108
…willing to grasp at any chance
of hope, however absurd.

160
00:12:52,067 --> 00:12:54,483
You can't talk about donation until…

161
00:12:54,692 --> 00:12:57,608
…they've understood
and accepted the death.

162
00:12:58,275 --> 00:13:01,567
That's why you must explain it
clearly and respectfully.

163
00:13:01,817 --> 00:13:03,192
ORGAN DONATION PROGRAM

164
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,192
I admit that the Arab thing…

165
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,358
I lost all respect for her.
I got so angry.

166
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:12,483
- You judged Manuela's reaction.
- Not mine, Betty, the mother's.

167
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:14,400
- I'm not a racist.
- Right.

168
00:13:14,608 --> 00:13:16,775
Your rejection was reasonable.

169
00:13:17,025 --> 00:13:21,525
When I mixed up "pain" and "plan,"
I just wanted to die.

170
00:13:22,192 --> 00:13:25,650
- I almost pissed my pants.
- Manuela! I understand.

171
00:13:26,067 --> 00:13:29,608
But you can't judge the relative.
That's essential.

172
00:13:29,817 --> 00:13:32,650
Pain and fear justify any reaction.

173
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,567
Even the rudest one.

174
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,983
We'll talk later, okay?

175
00:13:56,025 --> 00:13:57,567
What are you doing here?

176
00:13:57,775 --> 00:14:00,608
I need to see you for a minute.

177
00:14:00,858 --> 00:14:03,900
- Is there anything wrong?
- No. It was raining.

178
00:14:04,108 --> 00:14:07,233
- It's about time.
- I'll see you in the cafeteria.

179
00:14:12,358 --> 00:14:14,067
What's up?

180
00:14:14,275 --> 00:14:17,692
I need help getting my boots off.
I can't do it alone.

181
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:19,442
But, Leo…

182
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:22,983
Don't look at me like that.
I don't have anyone else.

183
00:14:23,775 --> 00:14:25,775
It's my maid's day off.

184
00:14:26,108 --> 00:14:28,442
I called. I couldn't find her.

185
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,317
Come on.

186
00:14:31,442 --> 00:14:32,775
You're soaking wet.

187
00:14:33,025 --> 00:14:35,400
- I've had a terrible day.
- Sit down.

188
00:14:38,483 --> 00:14:40,192
Give me your foot.

189
00:14:44,442 --> 00:14:46,400
It's really tight.

190
00:14:47,983 --> 00:14:50,608
Paco gave them to me
two years ago.

191
00:14:50,817 --> 00:14:54,900
At night in the hotel,
he had to take them off for me.

192
00:14:56,233 --> 00:14:57,775
The other one.

193
00:15:03,817 --> 00:15:06,275
- That's better!
- You can't go on like this.

194
00:15:06,608 --> 00:15:08,233
Like what?

195
00:15:08,817 --> 00:15:10,317
Boots again?

196
00:15:10,358 --> 00:15:12,775
Don't worry, these fit better.

197
00:15:12,983 --> 00:15:14,983
You can't be so fragile.

198
00:15:15,442 --> 00:15:18,275
What do you want me to do, Betty?

199
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,858
Shall we have dinner together?

200
00:15:25,067 --> 00:15:26,692
I'd love to, if you can.

201
00:15:28,025 --> 00:15:31,067
Don't worry about me,
I'm not doing so badly.

202
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:41,358
If I keep drinking like this,
I'll end up in A.A.

203
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:46,358
<i>- Have you seen my friend at El País?
 - Not yet</i>

204
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,358
- You don't want to?
- I feel awkward just showing up there.

205
00:15:49,567 --> 00:15:52,192
Don't be silly. Angel is charming.

206
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,108
- Promise me you'll go tomorrow.
- All right.

207
00:15:55,317 --> 00:15:56,900
Did you tell him who I am?

208
00:15:58,692 --> 00:16:00,483
You tell him, if you want.

209
00:16:01,067 --> 00:16:04,275
Except for drinking,
everything's difficult for me.

210
00:16:04,317 --> 00:16:08,775
Leo, you have to get out more.
You can't just wait for Paco to call.

211
00:16:09,025 --> 00:16:11,108
I can't help it.

212
00:16:11,317 --> 00:16:13,733
Then we'll get you
some professional help.

213
00:16:14,025 --> 00:16:17,192
I don't need professional help.
I need Paco.

214
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:21,317
You're not the only woman
in the world with marital problems.

215
00:16:21,817 --> 00:16:23,650
That's no consolation.

216
00:16:30,608 --> 00:16:33,692
Blanca, I had to tell you something,
but I forgot what.

217
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:37,775
Take your phosphorous pill.

218
00:16:39,067 --> 00:16:42,358
It doesn't help my memory,
but, God, it makes me horny.

219
00:16:42,608 --> 00:16:44,858
Phosphorous is an aphrodisiac.

220
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,775
What's that mean?

221
00:16:49,192 --> 00:16:50,608
Now I remember.

222
00:16:50,817 --> 00:16:54,025
If Paco calls,
tell him to call me tonight.

223
00:16:54,192 --> 00:16:57,442
If he asks how I am,
lie and say I'm great.

224
00:16:59,942 --> 00:17:01,233
That's my son.

225
00:17:01,442 --> 00:17:03,900
He's brought the bottles.

226
00:17:04,108 --> 00:17:06,692
Good. I'm going to be late.

227
00:17:13,275 --> 00:17:15,317
- Have you told her yet?

228
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:16,942
What are you waiting for?

229
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:19,775
I can't leave her now,
when she needs me most.

230
00:17:20,275 --> 00:17:22,192
We can't miss this opportunity.

231
00:17:22,358 --> 00:17:24,983
- When will we have another?
- Some opportunity!

232
00:17:25,192 --> 00:17:27,567
I'll believe it when I see the contract.

233
00:17:27,817 --> 00:17:30,108
I'll take care of that.

234
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,983
That's what worries me.

235
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:35,733
How's a producer going to give you
2 million without seeing the show?

236
00:17:37,233 --> 00:17:39,233
Take the garbage down.

237
00:17:43,192 --> 00:17:45,442
Is he asking for…

238
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:48,567
…something in exchange?

239
00:17:48,858 --> 00:17:50,400
Come on!

240
00:17:51,483 --> 00:17:55,150
Can't you find someone else?
I haven't danced for so long…

241
00:17:55,192 --> 00:17:57,525
…my kidneys are in bad shape.

242
00:17:57,733 --> 00:17:59,942
Don't start. You're the best.

243
00:18:00,192 --> 00:18:01,525
I was the best.

244
00:18:02,233 --> 00:18:04,275
That was a long time ago.

245
00:18:26,858 --> 00:18:28,983
This is my favorite place.

246
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:31,983
I love it. It's like
the heart and arteries.

247
00:18:32,192 --> 00:18:33,983
<i>This makes El País work.</i>

248
00:18:34,192 --> 00:18:36,983
- When it works.
- Excuse me.

249
00:18:37,192 --> 00:18:38,733
- Angel?
- That's me.

250
00:18:39,983 --> 00:18:41,567
- I'm Leo.
- What Leo?

251
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:44,150
Leo Macнas, Betty's friend.

252
00:18:44,317 --> 00:18:48,025
Oh, Betty called to say
you'd come. What's up?

253
00:18:48,275 --> 00:18:51,150
Well, actually,
I'm being rather bold…

254
00:18:51,192 --> 00:18:54,192
…but I'd like to write about
literature for your paper.

255
00:18:55,775 --> 00:18:58,192
I told you I was being bold.

256
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,775
A little boldness would be good
for the literary supplement.

257
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:05,650
- I don't know if I've read your work.
- You haven't.

258
00:19:05,858 --> 00:19:09,025
- Why? Do I look uncultured?
- I haven't been published.

259
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:13,775
I don't expect to get a job
for being Betty's friend.

260
00:19:14,275 --> 00:19:17,567
I've brought some of my work
for you to read.

261
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,025
A novel…

262
00:19:20,983 --> 00:19:22,317
…and two essays.

263
00:19:24,442 --> 00:19:27,358
I don't want to steal
any more of your time.

264
00:19:27,567 --> 00:19:30,108
You're not. Let's go to my office.

265
00:19:30,983 --> 00:19:34,733
- I need to go to the bathroom.
- It's the first door.

266
00:20:05,025 --> 00:20:07,733
<i>Is this novel,
The Cold-Storage Room, yours?</i>

267
00:20:08,067 --> 00:20:10,608
- Of course.
- Your name's not on it

268
00:20:10,817 --> 00:20:12,067
I forgot.

269
00:20:13,067 --> 00:20:15,067
Coffee?

270
00:20:16,733 --> 00:20:18,525
When did you start writing?

271
00:20:19,108 --> 00:20:20,858
When I was about 10.

272
00:20:21,275 --> 00:20:24,192
My family emigrated to Extremadura.

273
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,483
Everyone on my street was illiterate.

274
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:32,025
The neighbors paid me to
write letters for them…

275
00:20:32,067 --> 00:20:34,192
…and to read the ones
they'd received.

276
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:36,525
I haven't stopped writing since.

277
00:20:36,733 --> 00:20:38,650
Wonderful.

278
00:20:38,858 --> 00:20:40,525
Would you like some?

279
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:44,983
Do you specialize in a genre?

280
00:20:45,192 --> 00:20:47,858
No, I'd prefer to write
about what I like…

281
00:20:48,067 --> 00:20:51,442
…and avoid Spanish literature.
And one more thing.

282
00:20:51,858 --> 00:20:53,233
Another condition?

283
00:20:55,233 --> 00:20:57,150
I'd like to use a pseudonym.

284
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:58,900
No problem.

285
00:20:58,942 --> 00:21:00,942
What writers do you like?

286
00:21:01,233 --> 00:21:02,900
Mainly women.

287
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:07,317
Adventurous, suicidal lunatics
like Djuna Barnes, Jane Bowles…

288
00:21:07,567 --> 00:21:10,942
…Dorothy Parker, Jean Rhys,
Flannery O'Connor, Virginia Woolf…

289
00:21:10,983 --> 00:21:13,358
…Edith Wharton,
Isak Dinesen, Janet Frame.

290
00:21:13,525 --> 00:21:16,442
I write about them in
my article "Pain and Life."

291
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,275
That's how I could give
such a complete list.

292
00:21:19,442 --> 00:21:21,525
I like women's literature too.

293
00:21:21,733 --> 00:21:23,317
I'm glad.

294
00:21:23,858 --> 00:21:25,942
Do you like Amanda Gris?

295
00:21:25,983 --> 00:21:28,150
How do you know she's a woman?

296
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:32,067
Nobody knows who Amanda Gris is.

297
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:35,317
Now that you mention it, that's true.

298
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,858
But her genre is typically feminine.

299
00:21:38,067 --> 00:21:41,400
It ranges from Barbara Cartland
to Venezuelan soap operas.

300
00:21:46,692 --> 00:21:49,025
You don't like sentimental literature.

301
00:21:49,567 --> 00:21:52,942
I do, but I don't think
the literature you refer to…

302
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:55,442
…is really about people's feelings.

303
00:21:55,942 --> 00:21:57,817
There's no pain or grief.

304
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:01,192
Just routine, self-indulgent
sentimentality.

305
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,858
I respect your opinion,
but I don't agree.

306
00:22:04,817 --> 00:22:08,775
Could you develop what you
just said in 1500 words?

307
00:22:08,817 --> 00:22:11,025
I'm not the right person for that.

308
00:22:11,233 --> 00:22:12,983
I can't bear Amanda Gris.

309
00:22:13,192 --> 00:22:18,233
Great. We publish one column
in favor and one against.

310
00:22:18,567 --> 00:22:20,483
The latter will be yours.

311
00:22:21,817 --> 00:22:23,775
I don't want to write against.

312
00:22:24,358 --> 00:22:26,858
I have enough negative
things in my life.

313
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:28,775
I don't want to add more…

314
00:22:28,817 --> 00:22:31,067
…especially if you pay me for it.

315
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:43,233
I'm such an asshole!

316
00:23:30,858 --> 00:23:34,942
<i>- Rosa, it's Leo.
- Leo! Come in.</i>

317
00:23:41,692 --> 00:23:43,692
- What's that?
- Clothes.

318
00:23:43,858 --> 00:23:45,983
If you can't use them--

319
00:23:46,192 --> 00:23:50,067
We can use whatever we get
our hands on. They're brand new!

320
00:23:51,025 --> 00:23:53,775
My little girl is here!

321
00:23:53,983 --> 00:23:57,275
- How are you, Mom?
- So-so. What do you expect?

322
00:23:57,442 --> 00:23:59,483
- Why?
- She's been depressed.

323
00:23:59,692 --> 00:24:01,192
The weather. And Madrid!

324
00:24:01,692 --> 00:24:04,275
And her nerves.

325
00:24:04,483 --> 00:24:06,108
She gets so upset.

326
00:24:06,275 --> 00:24:08,025
Shut up, crabface!

327
00:24:08,233 --> 00:24:11,692
Your sister thinks it's all
my nerves and my imagination.

328
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:14,900
Don't fight. It must be the weather.
I feel bad too.

329
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:17,692
My legs feel like
they're made of lead.

330
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:20,858
You should go out more.
You'll end up paralyzed.

331
00:24:20,858 --> 00:24:22,233
I already am.

332
00:24:22,483 --> 00:24:23,817
You should take her out.

333
00:24:24,067 --> 00:24:25,983
She doesn't want to go out.

334
00:24:26,192 --> 00:24:28,817
Why should I?
To be killed by a skinhead…

335
00:24:29,025 --> 00:24:31,067
…or run over by a car?

336
00:24:31,275 --> 00:24:34,483
Those skinheads always stare at me.
I don't know why.

337
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:38,108
It's because she calls them
hippies and dirtbags to their face.

338
00:24:38,317 --> 00:24:39,692
There's only two around here.

339
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:43,025
I can't even see if they're
skinheads or yuppies.

340
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:47,108
- As she won't go to the eye doctor.
- Look. This is Amanda Gris' latest book.

341
00:24:47,358 --> 00:24:50,900
I can't read.
I can't even knit anymore.

342
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:54,567
Give it to me, I'll read it.
What a pretty anthology!

343
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:01,317
Let's sit on the sofa,
this chair hurts my coccyx.

344
00:25:01,525 --> 00:25:03,317
Your sister loves those chairs.

345
00:25:03,608 --> 00:25:06,233
With all that gold.
She's like a gypsy.

346
00:25:06,692 --> 00:25:09,608
I sit here all day doing nothing.

347
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:10,983
Since I'm almost blind.

348
00:25:11,192 --> 00:25:14,692
The doctor told me that he can
fix her eyes with an operation.

349
00:25:14,733 --> 00:25:17,692
Your sister wants me
in an operating room.

350
00:25:17,733 --> 00:25:19,442
] refuse!

351
00:25:19,692 --> 00:25:22,067
I won't be operated on
while I'm alive.

352
00:25:22,317 --> 00:25:24,858
When I'm dead,
do what you want with me.

353
00:25:25,067 --> 00:25:26,858
For God's sake, don't say that.

354
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:29,442
I won't be bothering you
much longer.

355
00:25:29,733 --> 00:25:32,275
All this just because
I mentioned the doctor!

356
00:25:32,525 --> 00:25:35,733
Leo, an operation is like a melon.

357
00:25:35,775 --> 00:25:38,525
You have to open it
to see if it's good…

358
00:25:38,733 --> 00:25:40,400
…or if it's rotten.

359
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:43,650
- You're right.
- Now she's a philosopher.

360
00:25:43,817 --> 00:25:47,275
The philosopher is constipated
and going to the bathroom.

361
00:25:47,817 --> 00:25:51,900
If I don't use a glycerin suppository,
I don't shit.

362
00:25:52,108 --> 00:25:55,275
You expect me
to pole-vault over you?

363
00:25:57,483 --> 00:26:00,108
- See how she is?
- She's terrible.

364
00:26:00,358 --> 00:26:05,483
She wants to be shitting constantly,
so she uses a suppository every day.

365
00:26:05,942 --> 00:26:08,025
I haven't offered you anything!

366
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,025
Where's my head at?

367
00:26:10,233 --> 00:26:11,650
I made you something.

368
00:26:11,858 --> 00:26:14,108
Do you want some coffee?

369
00:26:15,733 --> 00:26:18,067
If you contradict her,
she jumps on you.

370
00:26:18,275 --> 00:26:20,858
- She's like an animal.
- It's her age.

371
00:26:21,067 --> 00:26:22,692
She's used to the village.

372
00:26:22,692 --> 00:26:27,525
She'll end up like her sister Petra
and Grandmother: crazy!

373
00:26:27,692 --> 00:26:29,692
It's in her blood.

374
00:26:30,192 --> 00:26:32,108
Here, have some calamari.

375
00:26:32,317 --> 00:26:33,817
No, I'll just have coffee.

376
00:26:34,317 --> 00:26:37,650
I don't know how we'll end up,
we have the same blood.

377
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:41,692
When she goes out,
she dresses like a bag lady.

378
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:43,025
A little flan?

379
00:26:43,275 --> 00:26:46,150
You can't say no,
it's just milk and eggs.

380
00:26:47,733 --> 00:26:50,525
- I've brought you something.
- No, Leo, I can't.

381
00:26:50,733 --> 00:26:52,483
Don't start, Rosa.

382
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,733
I'll pay you back
when Santiago finds work.

383
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,650
- How is he?
- Bad.

384
00:26:59,692 --> 00:27:02,067
He does odd jobs
and drinks too much.

385
00:27:02,317 --> 00:27:05,733
With him and Mom,
I'm caught between two fires.

386
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:09,442
Maybe she should
come live with me.

387
00:27:09,608 --> 00:27:10,900
You can't do that!

388
00:27:11,108 --> 00:27:13,817
- You work too much.
- I'm used to it.

389
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:18,150
Criticizing me, are you?

390
00:27:18,358 --> 00:27:20,525
Don't listen to her, I'm fine.

391
00:27:20,817 --> 00:27:23,150
I wish my legs were
as good as my head.

392
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,608
- Cold hands.
- Don't you wear the robe I gave you?

393
00:27:26,817 --> 00:27:29,317
No, it's too beautiful to wear.

394
00:27:29,525 --> 00:27:32,608
- You should wear it.
- It's better in the closet.

395
00:27:33,442 --> 00:27:36,233
I'm ashamed to go out with her.

396
00:27:36,442 --> 00:27:38,483
I can't please your sister.

397
00:27:38,733 --> 00:27:41,817
She's as weird as
my late sister Petra.

398
00:27:42,025 --> 00:27:45,358
- The same.
- You're like her. And your aunt!

399
00:27:45,567 --> 00:27:47,442
- And Grandmother!
- And who else?

400
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:49,358
Leave our genes alone.

401
00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:52,858
I'm going back to the village,
where I won't be a nuisance.

402
00:27:53,067 --> 00:27:54,483
You're not a nuisance.

403
00:27:54,692 --> 00:27:59,067
If I fall asleep after lunch,
she wakes me up like a drill sergeant.

404
00:27:59,317 --> 00:28:02,025
- So she can sleep at night.
- She tells me to move.

405
00:28:02,275 --> 00:28:04,525
Damn! She wants me
to do aerobics?

406
00:28:04,733 --> 00:28:08,650
I hope I die soon so that
I won't bother anybody.

407
00:28:09,608 --> 00:28:11,442
Where did she put them?

408
00:28:11,483 --> 00:28:13,650
She hides things like a magpie!

409
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,442
- What do you want?
- The peppers.

410
00:28:15,692 --> 00:28:18,567
They're right behind you.

411
00:28:20,025 --> 00:28:22,108
See what I mean?

412
00:28:22,358 --> 00:28:23,942
I can't see a thing.

413
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:28,483
Blind as she is,
she wants to go to the village!

414
00:28:28,525 --> 00:28:29,733
I hate Madrid.

415
00:28:30,317 --> 00:28:32,442
You can't be alone in the village.

416
00:28:32,442 --> 00:28:36,275
We need to find someone to
help you with the housework.

417
00:28:37,317 --> 00:28:41,900
To snoop through the closets
and eat the sausages. No.

418
00:28:42,108 --> 00:28:43,817
I roasted some peppers.

419
00:28:44,067 --> 00:28:46,442
You shouldn't have. I have a cook.

420
00:28:46,483 --> 00:28:49,567
- How does that gypsy cook?
- Racist.

421
00:28:49,608 --> 00:28:51,483
Wonderfully. And she irons.

422
00:28:51,525 --> 00:28:55,025
Paco says no one irons his shirts
as well as she does.

423
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:57,192
I don't think in the war…

424
00:28:57,483 --> 00:29:00,233
…he's better taken care of
than at home. Right?

425
00:29:00,442 --> 00:29:02,358
More flan?

426
00:29:02,567 --> 00:29:04,650
I'll wrap it up for you.

427
00:29:04,817 --> 00:29:06,525
You look withered, Leo.

428
00:29:06,692 --> 00:29:08,483
I'll put in the calamari too.

429
00:29:08,692 --> 00:29:10,567
Going off to war.

430
00:29:10,567 --> 00:29:13,275
As if we didn't have
enough worries.

431
00:29:13,442 --> 00:29:15,233
And the omelet.

432
00:29:15,442 --> 00:29:18,608
Every day I pray
nothing happens to him.

433
00:29:19,442 --> 00:29:21,275
Pray for me too.

434
00:29:21,525 --> 00:29:23,692
Of course. I pray for you first.

435
00:29:23,942 --> 00:29:26,525
- She doesn't pray for me.
- You're an atheist.

436
00:29:26,567 --> 00:29:29,900
So what?
You pray, that's your thing.

437
00:29:30,108 --> 00:29:31,900
A cookie?

438
00:29:32,067 --> 00:29:35,233
By the way, could you
give me a little money…

439
00:29:35,442 --> 00:29:36,733
…for the village taxes?

440
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:38,442
Sure.

441
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:40,108
Here you are.

442
00:29:40,525 --> 00:29:44,233
And don't forget it's your
nephew's birthday next week.

443
00:29:44,483 --> 00:29:46,483
He doesn't need anything.

444
00:29:46,692 --> 00:29:48,608
He could use some jeans.

445
00:29:48,775 --> 00:29:51,733
He always wears the same ones.
And he's growing.

446
00:29:52,025 --> 00:29:54,733
He's turned out to be
serious and studious…

447
00:29:54,983 --> 00:29:58,900
…not like his crazy sister, who's not
even capable of washing her panties.

448
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:01,775
They're the same age,
grandmother and granddaughter.

449
00:30:01,983 --> 00:30:03,483
The calamari!

450
00:30:03,525 --> 00:30:07,650
Leocadia,
what a cross I have to bear.

451
00:30:10,525 --> 00:30:12,650
<i>"You have before you…</i>

452
00:30:12,858 --> 00:30:15,525
<i>…a woman created for anxiety."</i>

453
00:30:17,358 --> 00:30:19,358
<i>Djuna Barnes.</i>

454
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,483
<i>Leo, this is Angel.</i>

455
00:30:30,858 --> 00:30:34,192
<i>- What Angel?
- Angel from El País.</i>

456
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,358
I couldn't wait untijjomorrow.

457
00:30:36,567 --> 00:30:40,108
I read your essays and novel,
and I think they're wonderful.

458
00:30:40,358 --> 00:30:43,317
- You mean you liked them?
- Very much.

459
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:47,275
- You're not pulling my leg?
- Me?

460
00:30:47,442 --> 00:30:51,275
- Are you drunk?
- Yes, and when I drink, I don't lie.

461
00:30:51,525 --> 00:30:54,067
So think of a pseudonym,
because I want…

462
00:30:54,275 --> 00:30:56,358
<i>…"Pain and Life"
in the next supplement.</i>

463
00:30:56,775 --> 00:30:58,442
Am I being too familiar?

464
00:30:59,025 --> 00:31:01,442
No, of course not.

465
00:31:03,275 --> 00:31:07,192
- I love the title "Pain and Life."
- It's from a Bola de Nieve song.

466
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,108
I know.
"If I only have pain and life left…

467
00:31:10,317 --> 00:31:13,358
…oh, my love, don't let me live!"

468
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,275
Relating Djuna Barnes with
the "Cuban feeling" is new…

469
00:31:16,442 --> 00:31:18,567
…but it makes sense.

470
00:31:18,775 --> 00:31:21,400
That's just what I wanted to say.

471
00:31:21,442 --> 00:31:24,858
Do you have an editor
for the novel? I can help.

472
00:31:25,067 --> 00:31:28,150
Well, actually,
I didn't think I'd publish it.

473
00:31:28,483 --> 00:31:31,525
Really? Then why did you write it?

474
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,317
For pleasure. I told you I like writing.

475
00:31:37,108 --> 00:31:40,525
Well, come see me,
and we'll talk about the article.

476
00:31:40,775 --> 00:31:43,317
And sorry about this morning.

477
00:31:43,567 --> 00:31:45,275
I'm not a bad guy, really.

478
00:31:45,525 --> 00:31:47,358
But sometimes I act like a fool.

479
00:31:47,733 --> 00:31:51,067
Well, good night. Goodbye.

480
00:32:05,983 --> 00:32:07,525
Paco, it's me.

481
00:32:08,025 --> 00:32:10,483
<i>Leo? What time is it?</i>

482
00:32:10,733 --> 00:32:14,942
<i>- Early.
- Early? It's almost midnight.</i>

483
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,775
<i>I was asleep.
Has something happened?</i>

484
00:32:17,942 --> 00:32:19,692
Yes, I'm really happy…

485
00:32:19,858 --> 00:32:22,192
…and I wanted to share it with you.

486
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:24,775
<i>I went to El País to ask for work--</i>

487
00:32:24,983 --> 00:32:27,358
<i>Leo, are you drinking?</i>

488
00:32:29,317 --> 00:32:31,275
No, why?

489
00:32:31,317 --> 00:32:33,525
<i>You sound too lively…</i>

490
00:32:33,733 --> 00:32:36,275
<i>…considering the time.</i>

491
00:32:36,692 --> 00:32:38,900
It's not late for Madrid.

492
00:32:39,108 --> 00:32:43,192
<i>It's never late in Madrid,
but you forget I'm in Brussels.</i>

493
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,067
Oh, sure.

494
00:32:45,275 --> 00:32:48,275
I'll tell you about it tomorrow, okay?

495
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:50,150
<i>Are you all right?</i>

496
00:32:53,775 --> 00:32:56,817
Yes, my love. Kisses.

497
00:32:57,525 --> 00:32:59,442
Talk to you tomorrow.

498
00:33:15,983 --> 00:33:18,108
May I speak…

499
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:22,233
…to Lieutenant Colonel
Francisco Arcos?

500
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:24,983
<i>He's not here. Who's calling?</i>

501
00:33:26,192 --> 00:33:27,983
His wife, from Madrid.

502
00:33:29,192 --> 00:33:33,025
Tell him I called
and ask him to call me, please.

503
00:33:33,192 --> 00:33:34,900
<i>Anything else?</i>

504
00:33:35,067 --> 00:33:38,150
No, just have him call me.

505
00:33:38,192 --> 00:33:40,358
<i>All right. Goodbye.</i>

506
00:33:58,483 --> 00:34:00,733
Leo, at last.

507
00:34:00,942 --> 00:34:04,900
- Look, the second edition already.
- Great.

508
00:34:05,108 --> 00:34:07,192
- We've been expecting you.
- I've been busy.

509
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,817
Did you receive
the novel I sent you?

510
00:34:10,025 --> 00:34:12,150
- Of course.
- Well?

511
00:34:12,775 --> 00:34:15,525
Leo, it isn't
an Amanda Gris novel.

512
00:34:15,817 --> 00:34:17,108
Why the change?

513
00:34:17,317 --> 00:34:19,567
- I guess I'm evolving.
- Why?

514
00:34:19,775 --> 00:34:21,150
Maybe because I'm alive.

515
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:24,358
No, I mean, why change
if sales are good?

516
00:34:24,608 --> 00:34:28,233
Leo, sweetie, you forget our
collection is called "True Love."

517
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:32,442
A novel about a mother
who discovers her daughter's killed…

518
00:34:32,608 --> 00:34:35,608
…her father
who had tried to rape her.

519
00:34:35,817 --> 00:34:37,400
And so that no one finds out…

520
00:34:37,692 --> 00:34:42,233
…hides the body in the cold-storage
room of a neighbor's restaurant.

521
00:34:42,233 --> 00:34:44,317
It's hard to get rid of a corpse…

522
00:34:44,525 --> 00:34:46,983
…and the mother wants
to save her child.

523
00:34:47,192 --> 00:34:49,275
Wouldn't you do anything
for your son?

524
00:34:49,483 --> 00:34:52,233
We're talking about novels,
not children.

525
00:34:52,442 --> 00:34:54,983
Children only take away your life.

526
00:34:55,192 --> 00:34:57,275
Novels give you illusion to live.

527
00:34:57,567 --> 00:35:01,192
People buy our books to forget
the sordidness of their lives…

528
00:35:01,233 --> 00:35:03,650
…to dream, even if it's a lie.

529
00:35:03,817 --> 00:35:05,692
Coffee?

530
00:35:06,108 --> 00:35:07,733
Who'll dream of people…

531
00:35:07,942 --> 00:35:12,150
…who live in a seedy slum
like the living dead?

532
00:35:12,358 --> 00:35:14,983
Who'll identify with a protagonist…

533
00:35:15,192 --> 00:35:17,942
…who works emptying shit
out of hospital bedpans…

534
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:21,025
…who's got a junkie mother-in-law
and faggot son…

535
00:35:21,233 --> 00:35:23,275
…who's into black men?

536
00:35:23,733 --> 00:35:25,317
Have you gone nuts, Leo?

537
00:35:25,525 --> 00:35:28,900
Maybe. But reality's like that, Alicia.

538
00:35:29,108 --> 00:35:30,317
Reality.

539
00:35:30,525 --> 00:35:33,608
We all have enough reality
in our homes.

540
00:35:33,858 --> 00:35:36,358
Reality is for newspapers and TV.

541
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:37,900
Look at the result.

542
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:41,983
With so much reality,
the country's ready to explode.

543
00:35:42,025 --> 00:35:43,983
Reality should be banned.

544
00:35:44,192 --> 00:35:46,400
Don't pee out of the pot, Alicia.

545
00:35:46,608 --> 00:35:48,775
It's nobody's fault
your son's a junkie.

546
00:35:49,025 --> 00:35:51,108
Mind your own business!

547
00:35:51,942 --> 00:35:55,983
By the way, did you give 5000 pesetas
to my son the other day?

548
00:35:56,192 --> 00:35:58,108
Me? I don't even know him.

549
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:02,692
Well, he says he knows you
from seeing you here.

550
00:36:04,233 --> 00:36:05,650
That's bitter.

551
00:36:05,858 --> 00:36:07,733
He must have stolen it.

552
00:36:07,942 --> 00:36:11,567
Incredible. He swore he met you,
and you gave it to him…

553
00:36:11,775 --> 00:36:14,150
…for helping you take off your boots.

554
00:36:14,442 --> 00:36:16,942
He'll drive me crazy with his stories.

555
00:36:16,942 --> 00:36:20,108
That was your son?
Well, it's true.

556
00:36:20,233 --> 00:36:21,608
Really?

557
00:36:21,817 --> 00:36:24,942
- It was so absurd.
- Let's get focused.

558
00:36:25,192 --> 00:36:29,025
If Alicia starts talking about drugs,
she'll never stop.

559
00:36:31,733 --> 00:36:33,983
Leo, we hired you…

560
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,942
…to write love stories.

561
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:39,358
There's a love story in the novel.

562
00:36:39,608 --> 00:36:42,192
Where? I couldn't find it anywhere.

563
00:36:42,358 --> 00:36:46,817
The restaurant owner
who can't forget his ex-wife.

564
00:36:47,025 --> 00:36:50,317
The one who hires a hit man
to kill his mother-in-law…

565
00:36:50,525 --> 00:36:52,442
…so he can go to the funeral…

566
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:55,942
…see his ex-wife and convince her
to come back to him?

567
00:36:55,942 --> 00:36:57,525
Yes. That one.

568
00:36:57,817 --> 00:37:01,358
Is the best way to find a woman
to kill her mother?

569
00:37:01,983 --> 00:37:05,900
It was based on a real story.
It happened in Puerto Rico.

570
00:37:06,942 --> 00:37:08,525
You're kidding me.

571
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:13,358
Sorry you didn't like the novel.

572
00:37:13,608 --> 00:37:16,233
Wait a second. We have a problem.

573
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:18,025
A very big one.

574
00:37:18,733 --> 00:37:23,567
Your contract specifies
five romance novels a year…

575
00:37:23,775 --> 00:37:26,067
…for the next three years.

576
00:37:26,233 --> 00:37:28,442
I'll remind you:

577
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:31,150
"Novels of love in
cosmopolitan settings.

578
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,942
Sex, suggestive but only suggested.
Winter sports…

579
00:37:34,942 --> 00:37:39,733
…radiant sunlight, suburbs,
ministers, yuppies.

580
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,775
Absolutely no politics.

581
00:37:41,983 --> 00:37:45,733
Absence of social conscience.

582
00:37:45,942 --> 00:37:50,150
Illegitimate children, okay.
And of course, happy endings."

583
00:37:50,358 --> 00:37:54,650
The contract also specifies
the millions we advanced you.

584
00:37:54,858 --> 00:37:57,942
And your conditions:
We can't use your real name…

585
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:03,983
…nor reveal it, nor publish your photo.
No interviews.

586
00:38:04,358 --> 00:38:08,525
We agreed to everything, and,
until now, we've kept our part.

587
00:38:08,942 --> 00:38:11,108
But you haven't. That's the problem.

588
00:38:11,317 --> 00:38:12,942
The problem is the color.

589
00:38:13,108 --> 00:38:15,858
Leo, be clear and don't act
enigmatic with me.

590
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,900
I can't write a pink novel.
It comes out black.

591
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:21,608
I try, but each page
comes out darker.

592
00:38:21,817 --> 00:38:25,108
Come on. You've been writing
romance novels for 20 years.

593
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,483
You can't forget overnight.

594
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:31,775
The whole world can
change overnight. I'm leaving.

595
00:38:31,983 --> 00:38:34,025
Can't you at least try again…

596
00:38:34,233 --> 00:38:37,400
…before Tomбs sues you
for breach of contract?

597
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:40,983
Think about your house,
your trips to the Caribbean…

598
00:38:41,192 --> 00:38:45,942
…your collagen, your liposuctions,
your family, your anonymity.

599
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:47,817
Goodbye, Alicia.

600
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,858
Don't try to play dirty with us.

601
00:38:51,067 --> 00:38:52,483
Dirty?

602
00:38:52,692 --> 00:38:54,983
I just want to be clear and sincere…

603
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:57,400
…even if that isn't in the contract.

604
00:38:58,942 --> 00:39:02,358
Talk to your lawyer,
he'll tell you what'll happen.

605
00:39:02,983 --> 00:39:04,442
You can't do this.

606
00:39:04,775 --> 00:39:08,233
If we sue you, everyone will
find out you're Amanda Gris.

607
00:39:10,192 --> 00:39:11,608
On second thought…

608
00:39:11,817 --> 00:39:14,817
…it'd be good publicity
for another anthology.

609
00:39:14,858 --> 00:39:18,608
A juicy scandal. Knowing who she is,
who she's married to.

610
00:39:19,733 --> 00:39:21,525
We have to sue her, Tomбs.

611
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:32,775
<i>The only virtue
I can find in Amanda Gris…</i>

612
00:39:32,817 --> 00:39:35,567
<i>…is hiding herself in the
shadow of a pseudonym.</i>

613
00:39:35,983 --> 00:39:39,400
<i>Little is known about
her method of writing.</i>

614
00:39:39,608 --> 00:39:41,567
<i>Does she use a typewriter?</i>

615
00:39:41,775 --> 00:39:45,733
<i>Truman Capote distinguished
between writers and typists.</i>

616
00:39:45,775 --> 00:39:49,733
<i>We don't even know if
Amanda Gris is a good typist.</i>

617
00:39:49,775 --> 00:39:51,775
<i>Her work is fiction…</i>

618
00:39:51,817 --> 00:39:54,858
<i>…but this should not be
mistaken for literature.</i>

619
00:39:55,442 --> 00:39:58,858
<i>When I say "fiction," I mean lies.</i>

620
00:40:00,067 --> 00:40:01,608
My God.

621
00:40:07,733 --> 00:40:09,775
<i>- Who is it?
- It's Leo.</i>

622
00:40:09,983 --> 00:40:11,942
<i>Leo, I was just leaving.</i>

623
00:40:12,108 --> 00:40:14,067
<i>Why didn't you call?</i>

624
00:40:14,275 --> 00:40:15,900
I did, but your line was busy.

625
00:40:16,067 --> 00:40:17,900
<i>And it couldn't wait?</i>

626
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:20,275
No, but if you won't let me in, I'll go.

627
00:40:20,483 --> 00:40:21,942
<i>Come in.</i>

628
00:40:33,525 --> 00:40:36,692
I wouldn't bother you
if I didn't have a big problem.

629
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,942
I have problems too.

630
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:41,275
We can exchange them
like trading cards.

631
00:40:41,442 --> 00:40:43,858
Thanks, I thought
you were my friend.

632
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,067
Then ask me what's wrong.

633
00:40:46,233 --> 00:40:47,775
I just got here!

634
00:40:47,817 --> 00:40:51,067
You're the only person
who knows I'm Amanda Gris.

635
00:40:51,775 --> 00:40:54,567
Now that you mention it,
you do seem upset.

636
00:40:54,775 --> 00:40:58,775
What's wrong?
Come on, sit down, tell me about it.

637
00:40:58,942 --> 00:41:01,733
- I can't.
- You can't?

638
00:41:02,775 --> 00:41:05,567
No. Professional problems.

639
00:41:05,692 --> 00:41:07,317
Aren't we doing great.

640
00:41:07,692 --> 00:41:09,317
Let's have a drink.

641
00:41:12,358 --> 00:41:14,275
- The telephone.
- What?

642
00:41:14,483 --> 00:41:16,858
Someone's calling.
Can't you hear it?

643
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:20,067
Yes, but I'd rather fix the drinks.

644
00:41:20,275 --> 00:41:23,567
- Should I get it?
- No. Don't bother. I'll get it.

645
00:41:23,775 --> 00:41:25,192
All right.

646
00:41:27,692 --> 00:41:31,067
Yes? What a surprise.

647
00:41:31,275 --> 00:41:32,900
She just arrived.

648
00:41:33,067 --> 00:41:34,358
I'll put her on.

649
00:41:34,983 --> 00:41:36,525
Leo, it's for you.

650
00:41:43,858 --> 00:41:45,817
<i>- Who is it?
- Leo?</i>

651
00:41:46,025 --> 00:41:48,858
Paco! How did you know I was here?

652
00:41:49,067 --> 00:41:52,858
<i>You weren't at home,
and I thought you might be there.</i>

653
00:41:53,067 --> 00:41:54,692
What intuition.

654
00:41:54,733 --> 00:41:57,108
<i>You said if you weren't at home…</i>

655
00:41:57,317 --> 00:41:58,817
<i>…I should track you down.</i>

656
00:41:59,025 --> 00:42:00,692
That's my boy.

657
00:42:00,733 --> 00:42:02,775
<i>Is anything wrong?</i>

658
00:42:02,983 --> 00:42:05,650
Yes, I'll tell you about it later.

659
00:42:05,858 --> 00:42:08,150
But first, are there any rocks there?

660
00:42:08,358 --> 00:42:09,983
<i>Yes. Yes, of course.</i>

661
00:42:10,192 --> 00:42:13,483
A lot of rocks?
It's like the Grand Canyon here.

662
00:42:13,692 --> 00:42:16,692
<i>Yes. What's happened?</i>

663
00:42:16,733 --> 00:42:18,692
I've broken with Fascination.

664
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:21,692
I won't go into details,
it's complicated…

665
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,900
…and I suppose you're busy.

666
00:42:24,108 --> 00:42:28,192
<i>I am today. But in three days,
you can tell me in person.</i>

667
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:33,067
<i>- What?
- I was able to get a 24-hour leave.</i>

668
00:42:33,983 --> 00:42:35,775
Really?

669
00:42:36,067 --> 00:42:38,442
I need to see you so much.

670
00:42:38,733 --> 00:42:40,983
It'll be great this time, I swear.

671
00:42:41,233 --> 00:42:42,900
Not like my trip to Brussels.

672
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:46,400
<i>I hope so.
But Leo, my love, don't cry.</i>

673
00:42:46,692 --> 00:42:49,775
It's the emotion.
I'm crying from happiness.

674
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:54,567
There, I'm not crying anymore.
See what self-control?

675
00:42:54,775 --> 00:42:57,775
<i>I do. Say hi to Betty for me.</i>

676
00:42:58,108 --> 00:42:59,608
Paco says hi.

677
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:02,775
- So do I.
- She says hi too.

678
00:43:02,942 --> 00:43:05,567
<i>- How is she?
- She has problems.</i>

679
00:43:05,567 --> 00:43:08,608
<i>- What's wrong?
- I don't know. She can't tell me.</i>

680
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:11,025
- What's wrong?
- I'm fed up.

681
00:43:11,233 --> 00:43:14,025
She's fed up.
And has professional problems.

682
00:43:14,275 --> 00:43:16,567
<i>- Really?
- So it seems.</i>

683
00:43:16,775 --> 00:43:20,608
<i>I have to hang up, my love. Kisses.</i>

684
00:43:20,817 --> 00:43:24,192
For you too, darling.
And lots of rocks.

685
00:43:25,192 --> 00:43:27,400
It's strange he called here.

686
00:43:27,692 --> 00:43:30,650
I wasn't home,
and you're my only friend.

687
00:43:30,692 --> 00:43:34,775
- Is he coming?
- Yes. In three days.

688
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,150
I hope you'll clear up your situation.

689
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,567
Don't shout, listen to him.
Don't whine.

690
00:43:42,775 --> 00:43:44,483
Behave like an adult.

691
00:43:45,567 --> 00:43:47,608
We won't fight this time, I swear!

692
00:43:48,817 --> 00:43:51,567
Listen, what does
that "rock" thing mean?

693
00:43:52,358 --> 00:43:54,775
You asked if there
were rocks in Brussels.

694
00:43:55,108 --> 00:43:58,525
It's our way of saying
"I love you" in code.

695
00:43:58,692 --> 00:44:00,983
When we were just married…

696
00:44:01,192 --> 00:44:03,108
…we were taking a walk…

697
00:44:03,275 --> 00:44:06,150
…and we saw an ad for Rock Toilets.

698
00:44:06,317 --> 00:44:09,692
The slogan was, "I love you, Rock."

699
00:44:11,817 --> 00:44:14,317
Since then, when we
talk on the phone…

700
00:44:14,525 --> 00:44:18,108
…and we don't want people to
understand, we say "rock."

701
00:44:18,317 --> 00:44:20,775
Thatmeans we love each other a lot.

702
00:44:35,567 --> 00:44:36,900
I'm up here, Blanca.

703
00:44:37,108 --> 00:44:39,192
- I found it.
- At last!

704
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:42,317
You took it to the dry-cleaner's
two weeks ago.

705
00:44:42,525 --> 00:44:45,567
I can't remember anything.
I'm not well, Blanca.

706
00:44:45,817 --> 00:44:49,108
Now I can't find my onyx earrings.

707
00:44:49,275 --> 00:44:50,942
They should be on the dresser.

708
00:44:51,108 --> 00:44:53,358
I can't find them. You look.

709
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:56,900
I don't like jewelry missing here.

710
00:44:57,108 --> 00:44:58,400
Me neither.

711
00:44:58,442 --> 00:45:00,942
No one comes in here except me.

712
00:45:04,733 --> 00:45:06,650
<i>Leo, this is Angel.</i>

713
00:45:06,858 --> 00:45:10,025
<i>- What a pity.
- Are you coming?</i>

714
00:45:10,233 --> 00:45:12,525
Where's the cordless phone?

715
00:45:13,108 --> 00:45:16,608
<i>I just read in an interview
we're publishing…</i>

716
00:45:16,817 --> 00:45:21,317
<i>…that Bigas Luna's making a film
with a story that's very similar…</i>

717
00:45:21,483 --> 00:45:22,900
<i>…to your Cold-Storage Room.</i>

718
00:45:23,108 --> 00:45:25,858
- Here I am.
- You sound strange.

719
00:45:26,192 --> 00:45:27,817
I'm on the speakerphone.

720
00:45:29,108 --> 00:45:32,900
Do you know a scriptwriter
named Juan Josй Burйs?

721
00:45:33,233 --> 00:45:34,400
No, I don't.

722
00:45:34,608 --> 00:45:37,900
He's got a script that's
suspiciously similar to your novel.

723
00:45:38,108 --> 00:45:41,692
- Bigas Luna is directing it.
- Really? What a coincidence.

724
00:45:41,858 --> 00:45:43,775
Maybe it's plagiarism.

725
00:45:44,025 --> 00:45:47,525
I don't think so.
You're the only one who's read it.

726
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,025
<i>I suppose you've copyrighted it.</i>

727
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:54,400
- No.
- You haven't?

728
00:45:55,317 --> 00:45:57,567
I wasn't planning on publishing it.

729
00:45:57,858 --> 00:46:00,692
Really, Leo, I don't understand you.

730
00:46:01,442 --> 00:46:04,233
- You're not the plagiarist?
- Me?

731
00:46:04,442 --> 00:46:07,525
Plagiarism only bothers me
if they copy you or me.

732
00:46:07,567 --> 00:46:11,067
- I'm coming over now.
- You didn't answer my question.

733
00:46:11,525 --> 00:46:15,358
Now that you mention it, no.
I'll be right there.

734
00:46:16,025 --> 00:46:18,442
I can't find those earrings anywhere.

735
00:46:34,483 --> 00:46:38,233
Good morning.
Miguel Yuste, 40, please.

736
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:47,442
He published it!

737
00:46:47,733 --> 00:46:51,692
'"Amanda Gris: A Good Typist?'
by Paz Sufrategui."

738
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:54,900
'"Amanda Gris: the Alexandre
Dumas of Romance Novels. '

739
00:46:55,358 --> 00:46:56,775
By Paki Derm."

740
00:46:57,483 --> 00:46:58,650
Who's Paki Derm?

741
00:47:04,317 --> 00:47:06,233
Welcome, Paz Sufrategui.

742
00:47:06,358 --> 00:47:08,358
I don't want them to know it's me.

743
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:12,442
Thanks for publishing my article.
It's great seeing myself in print.

744
00:47:12,608 --> 00:47:15,733
By the way, who's the writer
who wrote in favor?

745
00:47:15,983 --> 00:47:18,150
Paki Derm? Yours truly.

746
00:47:18,442 --> 00:47:19,733
It can't be.

747
00:47:19,942 --> 00:47:23,233
Did I exaggerate with the
pachyderm thing? Am I that fat?

748
00:47:23,358 --> 00:47:26,775
Listen, Angel, writing is serious.
Even for Amanda Gris.

749
00:47:26,983 --> 00:47:28,942
You weren't very kind to her.

750
00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:32,525
Tomorrow there's a screaming
contest in Colmenar de Oreja.

751
00:47:32,733 --> 00:47:35,442
You must come. It's incredible.

752
00:47:35,483 --> 00:47:37,525
- It's lots of fun.
- I can't.

753
00:47:37,733 --> 00:47:41,150
A demonstration? The med students
are having a great one.

754
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,108
You can write about it.

755
00:47:43,358 --> 00:47:46,275
I'm busy tomorrow.
My husband's coming in.

756
00:47:46,733 --> 00:47:49,275
- There's a husband?
- Yes.

757
00:47:50,275 --> 00:47:52,358
I knew something separated us.

758
00:47:52,692 --> 00:47:55,317
"An abyss between us,"
as Amanda Gris says.

759
00:47:56,108 --> 00:47:58,317
<i>This is like the film The Apartment.</i>

760
00:47:58,317 --> 00:47:59,733
Yes, it is.

761
00:47:59,942 --> 00:48:02,692
In that film, Shirley MacLaine
falls in love…

762
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:07,358
…with someone who isn't the person
she's really in love with.

763
00:48:07,567 --> 00:48:09,733
Angel, I'm in love
with the person…

764
00:48:09,942 --> 00:48:11,692
…I think I'm in love with.

765
00:48:17,567 --> 00:48:19,400
How do I look, Blanca?

766
00:48:20,067 --> 00:48:21,567
Very sexy, ma'am.

767
00:48:22,067 --> 00:48:23,358
Really?

768
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,900
I don't know.

769
00:48:27,275 --> 00:48:30,108
- Paco!
- It's my Antonio.

770
00:48:31,317 --> 00:48:32,900
You can go when Paco arrives.

771
00:48:33,108 --> 00:48:37,233
- Come back tomorrow evening.
- I rehearse in the evenings.

772
00:48:37,275 --> 00:48:41,233
Then the next day.
I want to be alone with my husband.

773
00:48:41,233 --> 00:48:44,483
Of course. Enjoy yourself.

774
00:48:50,983 --> 00:48:53,358
Everyone's waiting for you.

775
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,525
Let them wait. I'm working.

776
00:48:57,358 --> 00:49:00,942
Shit! Who do you think you are,
making everyone wait?

777
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:03,192
This house comes first.

778
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,858
This house?
Your son should come first.

779
00:49:06,108 --> 00:49:08,525
What's going on? I heard a bang.

780
00:49:08,733 --> 00:49:10,692
I want to ask you a favor.

781
00:49:11,067 --> 00:49:12,650
I'll do whatever you want.

782
00:49:12,858 --> 00:49:15,150
- Ignore him.
- You shut up!

783
00:49:15,317 --> 00:49:18,900
- Don't say that to your mother.
- Sorry.

784
00:49:19,108 --> 00:49:22,983
You're making me more nervous
than I was. I need a drink.

785
00:49:23,192 --> 00:49:25,317
- Do you want one?
- Yes, please.

786
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:27,317
What is it?

787
00:49:27,358 --> 00:49:29,317
Everyone's waiting for her.

788
00:49:29,358 --> 00:49:32,775
An important producer
is coming to see us.

789
00:49:32,983 --> 00:49:35,817
Don't tell her about our problems.
She has her own.

790
00:49:35,983 --> 00:49:40,150
You want to take her to the studio?

791
00:49:40,192 --> 00:49:42,525
What are you waiting for?

792
00:49:42,733 --> 00:49:45,108
She's afraid. It's been so long.

793
00:49:45,317 --> 00:49:48,192
- The paella isn't ready.
- I'll finish it myself.

794
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:52,067
- I don't trust you. You're distracted.
- You're too much.

795
00:49:52,275 --> 00:49:55,608
Go on. I only need
to add the rice, right?

796
00:49:55,817 --> 00:50:00,317
If he comes before you finish it,
cover it with tinfoil.

797
00:50:00,317 --> 00:50:01,817
Mr. Paco likes it hot.

798
00:50:02,025 --> 00:50:04,192
- All right. Good luck.
- You too.

799
00:50:04,358 --> 00:50:06,192
Thanks, may God hear you.

800
00:50:09,567 --> 00:50:11,150
I won't drink anymore.

801
00:50:35,942 --> 00:50:38,275
Let me close the door.

802
00:50:50,192 --> 00:50:54,067
I could stay here all 24 hours
you're on leave.

803
00:51:01,608 --> 00:51:04,817
- Is Blanca here?
- No, we're all alone.

804
00:51:05,067 --> 00:51:07,525
Blanca's gone.
Where are you going?

805
00:51:07,733 --> 00:51:10,733
To the kitchen. I have shirts to iron.

806
00:51:11,983 --> 00:51:13,525
I can iron them if you want.

807
00:51:13,942 --> 00:51:16,192
She does it better, but…

808
00:51:16,733 --> 00:51:19,108
You're going to iron
with such little time?

809
00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:21,108
That's what I'm saying.

810
00:51:21,275 --> 00:51:23,525
Look what I made for you.

811
00:51:23,733 --> 00:51:25,608
Paella.

812
00:51:31,942 --> 00:51:33,817
I made it.

813
00:51:37,192 --> 00:51:40,983
Well, actually Blanca made it.
I just added the rice.

814
00:51:44,358 --> 00:51:46,317
It's cold.

815
00:51:46,817 --> 00:51:48,567
I'm not.

816
00:51:51,317 --> 00:51:54,983
- Nothing. I'll microwave it.
- Don't like it reheated.

817
00:51:55,483 --> 00:51:57,483
I'm sorry!

818
00:51:58,317 --> 00:52:00,567
I didn't know when
you would come…

819
00:52:00,775 --> 00:52:04,692
…because you didn't have
the decency to call and tell me.

820
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:07,275
Sorry, don't get so upset.
It's no big deal.

821
00:52:07,525 --> 00:52:08,942
Then kiss me.

822
00:52:18,442 --> 00:52:22,150
I want to shower.
I haven't changed all day.

823
00:52:23,150 --> 00:52:25,150
Afterwards, we have to talk.

824
00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:29,817
I have lots of news to tell you.

825
00:52:30,025 --> 00:52:31,525
But it can wait.

826
00:52:31,775 --> 00:52:35,025
First shower,
since you want to so much.

827
00:52:35,067 --> 00:52:37,358
Then we'll fuck.

828
00:52:37,525 --> 00:52:39,317
Then we'll rest.

829
00:52:39,483 --> 00:52:42,108
Then fuck again.

830
00:52:42,317 --> 00:52:44,400
And then, who knows?

831
00:53:22,317 --> 00:53:23,817
Come on, I'll help you.

832
00:53:43,733 --> 00:53:45,400
Calm down.

833
00:53:45,608 --> 00:53:47,983
We'll get to bed soon enough.

834
00:53:48,942 --> 00:53:50,733
We have to catch up.

835
00:53:51,025 --> 00:53:53,567
If not, I'll jump the first man I see.

836
00:53:53,817 --> 00:53:56,025
It's the phosphorous, you know.

837
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:58,567
- What?
- You don't remember?

838
00:53:58,775 --> 00:54:02,108
My memory pills.
They're aphrodisiacs.

839
00:54:02,275 --> 00:54:06,567
With you gone, I'm going
to end up an erotic writer.

840
00:54:08,650 --> 00:54:10,233
Paco, what's wrong?

841
00:54:10,942 --> 00:54:12,983
Nothing.

842
00:54:12,983 --> 00:54:15,733
I have the feeling
you're avoiding me.

843
00:54:15,942 --> 00:54:17,400
I'm not.

844
00:54:17,608 --> 00:54:20,025
But I have to tell you something.

845
00:54:20,067 --> 00:54:22,775
- Something? What?
- Calm down.

846
00:54:23,025 --> 00:54:25,025
- I'm very calm.
- You're not.

847
00:54:25,275 --> 00:54:28,608
What the hell do you
want to tell me?

848
00:54:28,817 --> 00:54:31,067
First, promise you'll be reasonable.

849
00:54:31,275 --> 00:54:33,983
- Who's not reasonable?
- You.

850
00:54:34,025 --> 00:54:36,358
I don't want yelling or tears.

851
00:54:36,525 --> 00:54:39,525
Who's yelling? Who's crying?

852
00:54:39,733 --> 00:54:41,483
Say it!

853
00:54:43,192 --> 00:54:45,067
I don't have a 24-hour leave.

854
00:54:46,775 --> 00:54:49,067
In two hours,
I have to be in Torrejуn.

855
00:54:49,233 --> 00:54:51,858
I'm catching a plane for Split.

856
00:54:52,025 --> 00:54:55,608
- Two hours?
- They've changed the schedule.

857
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:58,858
It's not possible.

858
00:54:59,275 --> 00:55:03,108
- The conflict has worsened.
- You're telling me!

859
00:55:05,025 --> 00:55:06,942
Don't act like a child.

860
00:55:08,567 --> 00:55:10,567
I'm a soldier, and I have my duty.

861
00:55:10,775 --> 00:55:14,650
You're my husband.
What about your duty to me?

862
00:55:14,858 --> 00:55:17,650
We said we'd park our problems
during the war!

863
00:55:17,858 --> 00:55:20,733
I'm sorry, I'm not made of steel!

864
00:55:20,942 --> 00:55:23,233
You can't park me like a car!

865
00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:27,067
Can't you try to understand
the situation?

866
00:55:29,608 --> 00:55:31,775
What's there to understand?

867
00:55:31,817 --> 00:55:34,608
Between me and your work,
your work wins.

868
00:55:34,817 --> 00:55:37,483
I'm trying to save many lives!

869
00:55:37,942 --> 00:55:39,692
Why not save mine?

870
00:55:39,983 --> 00:55:42,275
I'm talking about innocent people.

871
00:55:42,483 --> 00:55:45,775
People who get killed
lining up for bread…

872
00:55:45,817 --> 00:55:48,983
…who have neither electricity
nor medicine nor hope.

873
00:55:49,567 --> 00:55:51,442
You're talking about me.

874
00:55:51,817 --> 00:55:54,817
You're the height of selfishness.

875
00:55:56,233 --> 00:55:58,942
Can't you think about anyone
but yourself?

876
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:01,775
No!

877
00:56:01,817 --> 00:56:04,358
You're a son of a bitch…

878
00:56:04,608 --> 00:56:07,567
…for using those poor
Bosnians as a pretext!

879
00:56:19,192 --> 00:56:22,233
You volunteered
for the peacekeeping mission…

880
00:56:22,442 --> 00:56:25,442
…to run away from the war
you had here.

881
00:56:27,608 --> 00:56:30,067
A war where I'm the only victim.

882
00:56:32,233 --> 00:56:36,525
Since the day you decided to join
the NATO international forces…

883
00:56:36,775 --> 00:56:38,733
…you've been separating from me.

884
00:56:41,775 --> 00:56:46,275
You could have stayed in the
Ministry of Defense if you wanted to.

885
00:56:47,608 --> 00:56:52,900
At least until we solved
our problems.

886
00:56:57,858 --> 00:57:00,067
But you just ran away from me.

887
00:57:01,358 --> 00:57:03,775
Why can't you at least admit it?

888
00:57:06,233 --> 00:57:08,233
Answer me!

889
00:57:35,817 --> 00:57:37,358
<i>I hate you.</i>

890
00:57:37,567 --> 00:57:40,817
<i>I wish I could keep
hating you like I do now.</i>

891
00:57:41,025 --> 00:57:43,900
<i>The hatred would let me
tear him from my life.</i>

892
00:57:44,108 --> 00:57:47,608
<i>God, I don't believe in you,
but help me.</i>

893
00:57:49,775 --> 00:57:51,525
You're going?

894
00:57:52,775 --> 00:57:54,775
Paco, I'm talking to you.

895
00:57:58,692 --> 00:58:00,275
What?

896
00:58:00,775 --> 00:58:02,567
You're not going to eat?

897
00:58:05,817 --> 00:58:07,567
Anything else?

898
00:58:10,650 --> 00:58:14,233
You still owe me 30 minutes
of my two hours.

899
00:58:21,858 --> 00:58:25,858
Paco, I beg you,
give me at least 24 hours.

900
00:58:26,233 --> 00:58:29,275
Wherever, whenever.
As soon as possible.

901
00:58:29,525 --> 00:58:32,775
I couldn't stand 24 hours
like this last one.

902
00:58:33,233 --> 00:58:37,483
Don't you think we could
speak calmly, like two adults?

903
00:58:39,567 --> 00:58:42,358
Before you go,
tell me where we stand.

904
00:58:42,692 --> 00:58:43,858
I don't know.

905
00:58:44,692 --> 00:58:48,483
I need to know if you
want to save our marriage.

906
00:58:48,733 --> 00:58:51,608
In spite of everything, I do.

907
00:58:56,067 --> 00:59:00,692
Should I interpret your silence
as a negative?

908
00:59:01,192 --> 00:59:03,275
Stop pressuring me.

909
00:59:03,483 --> 00:59:05,483
I'm blocked, I can't speak.

910
00:59:06,692 --> 00:59:08,817
The great strategist.

911
00:59:09,025 --> 00:59:11,608
The specialist in major conflicts.

912
00:59:11,650 --> 00:59:15,608
There's no war
that compares to you.

913
00:59:26,650 --> 00:59:29,692
I'm slow, and I don't take hints…

914
00:59:29,733 --> 00:59:33,067
…so answer me
this one fucking time!

915
00:59:34,608 --> 00:59:38,067
Is there any chance,
however small it may be…

916
00:59:39,150 --> 00:59:40,858
…of saving our marriage?

917
00:59:45,150 --> 00:59:46,775
None.

918
01:00:56,442 --> 01:00:58,775
<i>Leo, sweetie, are you home?</i>

919
01:00:58,942 --> 01:01:00,483
<i>Or are you busy?</i>

920
01:01:00,525 --> 01:01:02,775
I'd like to talk to you.

921
01:01:03,233 --> 01:01:06,525
<i>It'll just be a second, okay?
Call me. </i>

922
01:01:06,525 --> 01:01:08,900
<i>Are you sure you're not home?</i>

923
01:01:43,442 --> 01:01:45,858
<i>Leo, honey, aren't you home?</i>

924
01:01:46,067 --> 01:01:50,192
<i>I'll keep talking.
See if you answer.</i>

925
01:02:00,442 --> 01:02:03,608
<i>I argued with Rosa,
and I'm going to the village.</i>

926
01:02:03,817 --> 01:02:06,108
<i>I called to say goodbye.</i>

927
01:02:06,275 --> 01:02:09,275
<i>I'm so depressed, my child.</i>

928
01:02:10,233 --> 01:02:13,567
<i>My blood pressure is so high.</i>

929
01:02:13,608 --> 01:02:15,317
<i>Call me.</i>

930
01:02:15,525 --> 01:02:18,817
<i>And don't believe
anything your sister says.</i>

931
01:02:18,983 --> 01:02:23,025
<i>You're not there? I would've
liked so much to talk to you.</i>

932
01:02:23,233 --> 01:02:25,650
<i>I can't see anything, honey.</i>

933
01:02:25,817 --> 01:02:27,692
<i>Your mother.</i>

934
01:03:29,483 --> 01:03:31,275
You want me to change it?

935
01:03:32,025 --> 01:03:33,400
Please.

936
01:03:42,650 --> 01:03:48,275
<i>Drink this bottle with me</i>

937
01:03:49,317 --> 01:03:52,483
<i>After we finish it</i>

938
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:55,233
<i>We'll go</i>

939
01:03:56,317 --> 01:04:02,275
<i>I want to know the taste</i>

940
01:04:02,483 --> 01:04:09,067
<i>Of your indifference</i>

941
01:04:10,067 --> 01:04:16,067
<i>Tonight I'm not going to plead</i>

942
01:04:16,858 --> 01:04:22,817
<i>Tonight you're going for good</i>

943
01:04:23,733 --> 01:04:29,567
<i>It's so difficult to leave you</i>

944
01:04:29,775 --> 01:04:35,525
<i>Though I know you don't
Love me anymore</i>

945
01:04:37,275 --> 01:04:42,442
<i>The years haven't
Taught me anything</i>

946
01:04:43,233 --> 01:04:48,817
<i>I always keep making
The same mistakes</i>

947
01:04:49,942 --> 01:04:56,067
<i>Once again
I'll drink with strangers</i>

948
01:04:56,567 --> 01:05:02,400
<i>And cry from the same pain</i>

949
01:05:30,942 --> 01:05:35,733
<i>Now, the flu, Felipe cures it too!</i>

950
01:05:42,275 --> 01:05:46,275
<i>Felipe, the jerk, has dissected
all our work!</i>

951
01:06:07,442 --> 01:06:11,150
I LOVE YOU, ROCK

952
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:17,858
What's wrong?

953
01:06:23,983 --> 01:06:27,733
<i>All of us students
want to have the luck…</i>

954
01:06:27,942 --> 01:06:31,233
<i>…of finding a job
without us getting fucked!</i>

955
01:06:31,442 --> 01:06:34,817
<i>Getting fucked over here,
fucked over there…</i>

956
01:06:35,067 --> 01:06:38,358
<i>…fucked forward, fucked back!</i>

957
01:07:19,358 --> 01:07:22,567
<i>My love, I know you want</i>

958
01:07:22,775 --> 01:07:26,817
<i>To take away my illusion</i>

959
01:07:27,025 --> 01:07:31,025
<i>My love, I know you could also</i>

960
01:07:32,358 --> 01:07:35,275
<i>Take away my soul</i>

961
01:07:35,483 --> 01:07:38,608
<i>But, oh, my love</i>

962
01:07:40,067 --> 01:07:43,067
<i>If you take away my soul</i>

963
01:07:43,108 --> 01:07:46,192
<i>Take away</i>

964
01:07:46,442 --> 01:07:49,900
<i>The pain as well</i>

965
01:07:50,108 --> 01:07:55,233
<i>Take with you all my despair</i>

966
01:07:55,275 --> 01:07:58,567
<i>And also my song</i>

967
01:07:58,775 --> 01:08:00,692
<i>Of suffering</i>

968
01:08:02,650 --> 01:08:08,067
<i>Oh, my love,
If you leave me, my life</i>

969
01:08:08,233 --> 01:08:13,692
<i>Let me feel my soul as well</i>

970
01:08:14,942 --> 01:08:19,483
<i>If all that is left in me
Is pain and life</i>

971
01:08:19,733 --> 01:08:26,025
<i>Oh, my love
Don't let me live</i>

972
01:08:38,775 --> 01:08:40,775
Good morning.

973
01:08:40,983 --> 01:08:43,192
How are you?

974
01:08:43,192 --> 01:08:45,025
Very bad.

975
01:08:45,067 --> 01:08:46,567
What are we doing here?

976
01:08:46,817 --> 01:08:49,442
We're in my new place.
It's breakfast time.

977
01:08:49,692 --> 01:08:52,025
<i>- I don't remember anything.
- I do.</i>

978
01:08:52,067 --> 01:08:56,108
And I'm going to blackmail you.

979
01:08:57,233 --> 01:08:59,108
Blackmail?

980
01:08:59,150 --> 01:09:01,025
Look out the window.

981
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:13,025
I must have drunk too much.

982
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:17,817
And you revealed "the flower of your
secret," as Amanda Gris might say.

983
01:09:22,608 --> 01:09:23,900
Forget I'm a journalist.

984
01:09:24,150 --> 01:09:26,233
I won't do anything,
on one condition.

985
01:09:27,108 --> 01:09:28,650
What?

986
01:09:29,025 --> 01:09:32,108
Don't pull yesterday's stunt again.

987
01:09:32,817 --> 01:09:34,983
And share your secret with me.

988
01:09:46,317 --> 01:09:47,983
All right?

989
01:09:52,025 --> 01:09:53,525
All right.

990
01:09:59,067 --> 01:10:00,608
Betty, you scared me.

991
01:10:00,817 --> 01:10:02,733
I scared you. You're too much.

992
01:10:02,942 --> 01:10:04,900
Why are you here?

993
01:10:05,108 --> 01:10:08,400
I've been looking for you all night.
Why didn't you call?

994
01:10:08,608 --> 01:10:12,525
- Me?
- I called the hospitals and the police.

995
01:10:12,733 --> 01:10:14,525
Don't shout, my head hurts.

996
01:10:14,733 --> 01:10:16,650
Do you want a beer? It'll help.

997
01:10:16,858 --> 01:10:21,025
- I've stopped drinking.
- And you?

998
01:10:21,067 --> 01:10:23,775
- Take a tranquilizer.
- There aren't any.

999
01:10:23,983 --> 01:10:25,775
I took them all last night.

1000
01:10:25,983 --> 01:10:29,900
So as I thought, you took
a whole bottle of Trankimazin.

1001
01:10:30,150 --> 01:10:33,650
Half a bottle.
But I'd rather not talk about it.

1002
01:10:33,858 --> 01:10:38,025
You never want to talk about it,
and you don't let us do it either.

1003
01:10:40,483 --> 01:10:43,733
Is there something
I haven't let you say?

1004
01:10:44,608 --> 01:10:47,108
Is there something?

1005
01:10:47,317 --> 01:10:50,983
Don't you wonder how I got in here,
who gave me the keys?

1006
01:10:52,817 --> 01:10:54,483
Paco!

1007
01:10:54,692 --> 01:10:58,400
Weren't you surprised
he called me the other day?

1008
01:10:58,817 --> 01:11:01,858
- Wasn't it me he called?
- No!

1009
01:11:02,108 --> 01:11:05,608
What must be done
for you to face reality?

1010
01:11:06,150 --> 01:11:09,567
What must we do
for you to accept reality?

1011
01:11:10,233 --> 01:11:12,025
Not hide it from me.

1012
01:11:12,233 --> 01:11:16,650
How, if your whole world can fall apart
because your boots are too tight?

1013
01:11:16,858 --> 01:11:18,567
What are you doing?

1014
01:11:24,192 --> 01:11:27,108
Paco's been trying
to talk to you for years.

1015
01:11:27,317 --> 01:11:30,942
But you always start screaming
like a madwoman.

1016
01:11:31,108 --> 01:11:33,650
And Paco's not cruel.

1017
01:11:33,900 --> 01:11:37,192
Why didn't you tell me?
You're an expert.

1018
01:11:37,442 --> 01:11:38,900
An expert? In what?

1019
01:11:39,150 --> 01:11:40,858
In giving bad news.

1020
01:11:41,067 --> 01:11:43,358
You even give seminars to doctors.

1021
01:11:43,567 --> 01:11:46,442
- I'm telling you now.
- Great.

1022
01:11:46,650 --> 01:11:48,317
So now you've told me.

1023
01:11:48,525 --> 01:11:50,067
Please go.

1024
01:11:52,608 --> 01:11:53,900
I'm not going.

1025
01:11:56,025 --> 01:11:58,692
I've broken up with Paco too.

1026
01:11:59,150 --> 01:12:00,900
I did it for you.

1027
01:12:02,858 --> 01:12:06,442
Last night, when he told me
what had happened…

1028
01:12:06,650 --> 01:12:10,817
…I asked him how he could
leave you in such a state.

1029
01:12:13,525 --> 01:12:17,275
He insisted that it was
your natural state…

1030
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:22,108
…but since I know you better,
I knew how you must have felt.

1031
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:26,358
So I asked for his keys…

1032
01:12:27,067 --> 01:12:30,317
…and I came here
so you wouldn't be alone.

1033
01:12:31,942 --> 01:12:34,858
When I saw the vomit
and the empty pill bottle…

1034
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:37,067
…l feared the worst.

1035
01:12:39,067 --> 01:12:42,025
You don't know
how anxious I've been.

1036
01:12:44,775 --> 01:12:46,692
Does he know?

1037
01:12:51,692 --> 01:12:54,775
He called from the airport today…

1038
01:12:54,817 --> 01:12:56,817
…before getting on the plane.

1039
01:12:56,817 --> 01:12:58,567
Is he really going to Split?

1040
01:13:03,108 --> 01:13:04,733
He should be there by now.

1041
01:13:07,733 --> 01:13:09,817
How long have you been lovers?

1042
01:13:10,025 --> 01:13:13,942
Since a few months before
he went to Brussels.

1043
01:13:14,942 --> 01:13:16,692
Paco came to see me.

1044
01:13:18,317 --> 01:13:19,858
You were having a crisis…

1045
01:13:20,108 --> 01:13:23,192
…and Paco couldn't stand
to see you suffer.

1046
01:13:25,942 --> 01:13:29,942
He didn't love you anymore,
but he didn't know how to tell you.

1047
01:13:31,525 --> 01:13:36,275
He came to me as your friend
and a psychologist.

1048
01:13:36,483 --> 01:13:40,858
I said that as your friend,
I couldn't accept him as a patient.

1049
01:13:41,067 --> 01:13:44,025
I recommended a colleague.

1050
01:13:44,233 --> 01:13:47,025
But he never saw him.

1051
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:51,817
Paco continued to visit me.

1052
01:13:52,858 --> 01:13:56,483
He liked to talk about it with me,
as a friend.

1053
01:13:58,317 --> 01:14:00,900
And one day, don't ask me how…

1054
01:14:02,108 --> 01:14:06,233
…we ended up in each other's arms.

1055
01:14:08,858 --> 01:14:10,775
Telephone.

1056
01:14:11,108 --> 01:14:12,692
I hear it.

1057
01:14:14,733 --> 01:14:16,733
Aren't you going to answer it?

1058
01:14:18,942 --> 01:14:21,692
You answer it. It's for you.

1059
01:14:22,983 --> 01:14:25,317
Tell him I know everything…

1060
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:28,483
…but wait until I've left.

1061
01:14:36,317 --> 01:14:39,108
<i>Is that you, Leo?</i>

1062
01:14:39,317 --> 01:14:41,942
<i>- No, it's not.
- This is her mother.</i>

1063
01:14:42,150 --> 01:14:44,775
<i>Tell her I want to talk to her.</i>

1064
01:14:44,983 --> 01:14:46,775
She's coming.

1065
01:14:50,567 --> 01:14:51,692
It's your mother.

1066
01:14:58,817 --> 01:15:02,317
Hello, Mom, I was about to call you.

1067
01:15:02,525 --> 01:15:05,733
I'm so sad. If your father were alive--

1068
01:15:05,942 --> 01:15:08,150
Shut up, crabface!

1069
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:10,650
Honey, I'm going to the village.

1070
01:15:10,858 --> 01:15:12,733
I can only be comfortable there.

1071
01:15:13,192 --> 01:15:16,483
Well, Mom, I'm coming with you.

1072
01:15:16,692 --> 01:15:18,983
I'll come pick you up now.

1073
01:15:19,275 --> 01:15:21,275
You're coming too? Wonderful!

1074
01:15:21,442 --> 01:15:23,650
Leo, listen.
No one's thrown her out.

1075
01:15:23,858 --> 01:15:25,483
- Your husband.
- Santiago?

1076
01:15:25,692 --> 01:15:26,858
He didn't throw her out.

1077
01:15:27,067 --> 01:15:30,442
He just said he doesn't need
her permission to drink.

1078
01:15:30,692 --> 01:15:33,483
<i>- She called him a drunkard!
- He is!</i>

1079
01:15:33,733 --> 01:15:35,775
<i>You have no common sense.</i>

1080
01:15:35,817 --> 01:15:37,608
You're the one who doesn't have it.

1081
01:15:37,817 --> 01:15:42,358
What do you want?
To sit around with my mouth shut?

1082
01:15:42,567 --> 01:15:44,692
She treats me like a dog!

1083
01:15:44,692 --> 01:15:47,192
Rosa, Mom, please don't shout.

1084
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:49,233
<i>Don't shout, Rosa!</i>

1085
01:15:49,442 --> 01:15:53,275
- I'm on my way.
- Give me the phone! Leo?

1086
01:15:53,442 --> 01:15:55,108
She hung up.

1087
01:15:55,733 --> 01:15:57,942
What's wrong with her?

1088
01:15:58,150 --> 01:16:00,067
I'm a little worried.

1089
01:16:00,275 --> 01:16:02,483
Me too. You're going to kill me.

1090
01:16:02,733 --> 01:16:06,275
- Why don't you come to the village?
- Me? Give me a break.

1091
01:16:06,525 --> 01:16:09,775
I don't want to leave you here
with so many problems.

1092
01:16:10,775 --> 01:16:12,567
You're going to drive me nuts.

1093
01:16:13,567 --> 01:16:16,733
You know who you remind me of?

1094
01:16:16,900 --> 01:16:20,733
Of my sister Petra.
You're the spitting image of her…

1095
01:16:20,733 --> 01:16:22,358
…may she rest in peace.

1096
01:16:22,692 --> 01:16:25,650
Those same beautiful lunatic eyes.

1097
01:16:47,150 --> 01:16:49,692
Omelet?

1098
01:16:50,567 --> 01:16:52,275
How about some pork?

1099
01:16:52,775 --> 01:16:54,608
No, Mother. I can't.

1100
01:16:54,817 --> 01:16:58,608
Since you started with
that weight-loss nonsense…

1101
01:16:58,817 --> 01:17:01,525
…you've really gone downhill.

1102
01:17:02,150 --> 01:17:04,983
Angel, don't ever go on a diet.

1103
01:17:05,317 --> 01:17:07,400
Don't worry, I love to eat.

1104
01:17:07,608 --> 01:17:09,567
And you're handsome that way.

1105
01:17:10,608 --> 01:17:12,650
She was a chubby little girl.

1106
01:17:13,108 --> 01:17:16,567
She weighed 10 pounds
when she was born…

1107
01:17:16,775 --> 01:17:21,608
…after two days of labor. She wasn't
breathing when she came out.

1108
01:17:21,650 --> 01:17:25,650
Thank God my late mother-in-law
was like a sergeant and said:

1109
01:17:25,692 --> 01:17:29,442
"Take her outside."
I said, "It's freezing.

1110
01:17:29,650 --> 01:17:32,733
You don't know how cold
it gets here during winter."

1111
01:17:32,983 --> 01:17:36,983
But she was like a sergeant.
We took the baby outside…

1112
01:17:37,275 --> 01:17:40,608
…she reacted, and she made it.

1113
01:17:44,317 --> 01:17:45,650
Remember, Leocadia?

1114
01:17:46,608 --> 01:17:48,483
How would I remember that?

1115
01:17:48,817 --> 01:17:53,358
No, I mean the poem
I wrote about the village:

1116
01:17:53,525 --> 01:17:55,567
<i>Beautiful is the morning, Leo.</i>

1117
01:17:55,775 --> 01:17:58,150
<i>The sun sparkles…</i>

1118
01:17:58,317 --> 01:18:00,608
<i>…the flowers offer their perfumes…</i>

1119
01:18:00,817 --> 01:18:03,358
<i>…the orchard is rustling.</i>

1120
01:18:03,567 --> 01:18:06,150
<i>From branch to branch,
without stopping…</i>

1121
01:18:06,317 --> 01:18:08,900
<i>…the joyous birdies flutter and sing…</i>

1122
01:18:09,108 --> 01:18:11,192
<i>…and their chirping enchants me.</i>

1123
01:18:11,525 --> 01:18:13,650
<i>You can hear the soft bleating…</i>

1124
01:18:13,900 --> 01:18:15,525
<i>…of the flocks of sheep…</i>

1125
01:18:15,817 --> 01:18:19,567
<i>…that stand out against the pasture
like snowflakes.</i>

1126
01:18:19,775 --> 01:18:21,650
<i>Here stands a small hut…</i>

1127
01:18:21,817 --> 01:18:24,025
<i>…home for shepherds…</i>

1128
01:18:24,233 --> 01:18:26,608
<i>…there, a white cottage…</i>

1129
01:18:26,775 --> 01:18:29,275
<i>…whiter than a lily.</i>

1130
01:18:29,483 --> 01:18:31,900
<i>Afterwards, we come to a farm.</i>

1131
01:18:32,108 --> 01:18:34,067
<i>Next to the farm, there's a garden.</i>

1132
01:18:34,275 --> 01:18:35,983
<i>Next to the garden, a house.</i>

1133
01:18:36,192 --> 01:18:38,983
<i>And next to the house, a church.</i>

1134
01:18:39,192 --> 01:18:42,108
<i>The hill is covered with oaks…</i>

1135
01:18:42,275 --> 01:18:44,733
<i>…the valley with fruit…</i>

1136
01:18:44,942 --> 01:18:48,400
<i>…and the river with many trees.</i>

1137
01:18:48,442 --> 01:18:50,192
<i>Do you know what it is?</i>

1138
01:18:50,442 --> 01:18:52,400
<i>It's my village.</i>

1139
01:19:04,525 --> 01:19:07,900
It's Jacinta! It's Jacinta!

1140
01:19:09,025 --> 01:19:13,442
I heard a car, and I said to myself,
"That's Jacinta."

1141
01:19:16,358 --> 01:19:19,233
How are you?
What are you doing here?

1142
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:22,358
- And Leo?
- I came with her.

1143
01:19:22,608 --> 01:19:25,150
There she is. What happened?

1144
01:19:27,775 --> 01:19:30,900
She must have tripped on the curb.

1145
01:19:31,067 --> 01:19:33,942
Don't worry, Jacinta, she's all right.

1146
01:19:34,150 --> 01:19:36,275
Open the door.

1147
01:19:37,025 --> 01:19:38,692
Open it.

1148
01:19:41,942 --> 01:19:44,025
Don't worry, she's all right.

1149
01:19:46,275 --> 01:19:47,942
This way.

1150
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:16,358
You haven't touched the broth.

1151
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:20,233
What's wrong, Leo?

1152
01:20:20,442 --> 01:20:22,525
I'm going crazy, Mom.

1153
01:20:22,733 --> 01:20:25,650
You? Your sister is, but you're not.

1154
01:20:25,858 --> 01:20:28,442
Yes, like Aunt Petra…

1155
01:20:28,650 --> 01:20:32,150
…like Grandmother, crazy.

1156
01:20:32,358 --> 01:20:34,692
It's Paco, isn't it?

1157
01:20:36,067 --> 01:20:40,233
I was imagining it. Yes, I was.

1158
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:42,275
My poor child.

1159
01:20:42,317 --> 01:20:46,567
So young and already like a cow
without a cowbell.

1160
01:20:47,608 --> 01:20:49,733
Like a cow without a cowbell?

1161
01:20:49,942 --> 01:20:51,733
Yes, lost…

1162
01:20:51,942 --> 01:20:56,150
…with no direction, drifting, like me.

1163
01:20:56,358 --> 01:20:58,025
Like you?

1164
01:20:58,233 --> 01:21:00,900
I'm like a cow without a cowbell too.

1165
01:21:01,150 --> 01:21:04,483
But at my age, that's more normal.

1166
01:21:05,733 --> 01:21:08,983
That's why I want to live here
in the village.

1167
01:21:09,483 --> 01:21:12,067
When we women
lose our husband…

1168
01:21:12,442 --> 01:21:17,150
…because he's died or left with
another woman, it's the same.

1169
01:21:17,358 --> 01:21:21,733
We have to return to the place
where we were born…

1170
01:21:21,942 --> 01:21:24,275
…visit the village chapel…

1171
01:21:24,483 --> 01:21:28,733
…sit outside with the neighbors
and pray novenas with them…

1172
01:21:28,942 --> 01:21:31,275
…even if you're not believers.

1173
01:21:31,858 --> 01:21:37,442
Because if we don't, we get lost
like a cow without a cowbell.

1174
01:21:40,525 --> 01:21:42,692
My child.

1175
01:21:42,858 --> 01:21:45,983
With the effort it took me
to raise you.

1176
01:21:57,733 --> 01:22:01,192
- And the ones with the big head?
- Pins.

1177
01:22:01,358 --> 01:22:03,275
- And the others?
- Needles.

1178
01:22:03,483 --> 01:22:04,817
Of course.

1179
01:22:05,025 --> 01:22:07,233
- Do you know the saying?
- Which one?

1180
01:22:07,275 --> 01:22:11,900
"Jealousy is a needle
that keeps me from living.

1181
01:22:12,108 --> 01:22:16,317
If you want to know about jealousy,
ask me."

1182
01:22:16,358 --> 01:22:18,983
And me.

1183
01:22:19,192 --> 01:22:20,817
How's Aunt Valentina?

1184
01:22:21,025 --> 01:22:22,692
- She jumped into the well.
- Where?

1185
01:22:22,858 --> 01:22:24,650
- Into the well.
- She killed herself?

1186
01:22:24,858 --> 01:22:28,983
Yes. She was there a long time
until some workmen saw her…

1187
01:22:29,192 --> 01:22:31,650
…and called her son,
who came to see her…

1188
01:22:31,858 --> 01:22:34,733
…and they pulled her out,
just like that.

1189
01:22:34,942 --> 01:22:36,608
I didn't know you had an aunt.

1190
01:22:36,817 --> 01:22:41,150
She was great. She used to tell me
fantastic stories.

1191
01:22:41,192 --> 01:22:43,817
She was a good woman,
but so lonely.

1192
01:22:44,108 --> 01:22:49,983
She was lonely and very tall,
and very…You know.

1193
01:22:50,150 --> 01:22:52,275
Why don't you sing me a song?

1194
01:22:52,483 --> 01:22:56,483
- A song? Well…
- Yes, a song, before I get depressed.

1195
01:22:58,150 --> 01:23:01,900
What about the one called
"I'm from Almagro"?

1196
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:03,858
Come on.

1197
01:23:04,067 --> 01:23:07,025
<i>I'm from Almagro
I'm from AImagro</i>

1198
01:23:07,233 --> 01:23:10,650
<i>I'm from the rich riverside</i>

1199
01:23:10,858 --> 01:23:14,233
<i>Where embroidery is made</i>

1200
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:18,567
<i>Where eggplant is cooked</i>

1201
01:23:18,817 --> 01:23:21,650
<i>Eggplant is cooked</i>

1202
01:23:21,858 --> 01:23:25,150
<i>Eggplant is cooked</i>

1203
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:28,858
<i>I'm from Almagro
I'm from Almagro</i>

1204
01:23:29,067 --> 01:23:33,275
<i>I'm from the rich riverside</i>

1205
01:23:33,317 --> 01:23:36,233
- Leocadia, phone call.
- For me?

1206
01:23:36,442 --> 01:23:38,608
Isn't your name Leocadia?

1207
01:23:42,192 --> 01:23:44,025
- Who is it?
- Who knows?

1208
01:23:44,192 --> 01:23:46,608
- Man or woman?
- Woman, sweetie, woman.

1209
01:23:52,275 --> 01:23:54,900
<i>Leo? It's Alicia.</i>

1210
01:23:55,150 --> 01:23:57,817
Alicia. How did you get
my phone number?

1211
01:23:58,067 --> 01:24:00,483
You sent it with your last package.

1212
01:24:01,192 --> 01:24:02,858
My last package.

1213
01:24:03,067 --> 01:24:06,483
We love these last two novels,
sweetheart.

1214
01:24:06,775 --> 01:24:09,483
It's the best you've written
in a long time.

1215
01:24:09,900 --> 01:24:11,192
I'm glad.

1216
01:24:11,233 --> 01:24:14,900
<i>Listen, I read they're making
a film with a plot…</i>

1217
01:24:15,067 --> 01:24:17,692
<i>…identical to your
Cold-Storage Room.</i>

1218
01:24:17,942 --> 01:24:19,442
I've read that too.

1219
01:24:19,650 --> 01:24:21,650
Quite a coincidence, isn't it?

1220
01:24:22,233 --> 01:24:23,358
I don't know.

1221
01:24:24,650 --> 01:24:27,567
You know, Tomбs is paranoid,
and I don't believe it…

1222
01:24:27,775 --> 01:24:31,233
…but you haven't sold it
with another name, have you?

1223
01:24:31,275 --> 01:24:34,900
Me? When you rejected it,
I stuck it in a drawer.

1224
01:24:35,108 --> 01:24:37,025
No one would have stolen it?

1225
01:24:39,025 --> 01:24:42,233
Could it have been
stolen from you, Alicia?

1226
01:24:42,233 --> 01:24:44,108
You have the only copy.

1227
01:24:44,108 --> 01:24:46,108
Who would steal it from me?

1228
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:47,817
Your son, the junkie.

1229
01:24:48,025 --> 01:24:49,567
<i>He's stolen things before.</i>

1230
01:24:49,775 --> 01:24:52,025
<i>He could photocopy it in an hour.</i>

1231
01:24:52,233 --> 01:24:55,025
And since it was so bad,
I didn't copyright it.

1232
01:24:55,525 --> 01:24:57,067
You didn't?

1233
01:24:57,233 --> 01:24:59,775
Why copyright garbage like that?

1234
01:24:59,942 --> 01:25:02,400
Leo, garbage should
be copyrighted too.

1235
01:25:03,233 --> 01:25:05,692
I'll ask my son.

1236
01:25:05,983 --> 01:25:09,525
Anyway, I think it's better to forget it.

1237
01:25:10,192 --> 01:25:13,108
The main thing is that
Amanda Gris is back.

1238
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:16,108
Yes, that's the important thing.

1239
01:25:22,067 --> 01:25:23,900
Leo, what a pleasure.

1240
01:25:24,108 --> 01:25:27,775
Did you give my phone number
to my publishers? Alicia called me.

1241
01:25:28,025 --> 01:25:30,025
Yes, I did. Why?

1242
01:25:30,483 --> 01:25:32,983
They've received
two Amanda Gris novels…

1243
01:25:33,025 --> 01:25:35,442
…and I didn't write or send them.

1244
01:25:35,650 --> 01:25:38,067
- You didn't tell her?
- Of course not.

1245
01:25:38,983 --> 01:25:40,150
Thank God.

1246
01:25:40,692 --> 01:25:42,608
Did you happen to write them?

1247
01:25:43,067 --> 01:25:46,900
Don't tell me they noticed
and have rejected them?

1248
01:25:46,983 --> 01:25:49,233
No, they're ecstatic.

1249
01:25:49,608 --> 01:25:51,817
But why didn't you tell me?

1250
01:25:52,067 --> 01:25:53,858
I was afraid you'd say no.

1251
01:25:54,067 --> 01:25:56,692
I'm sorry. But cheer up.
You're free now.

1252
01:25:56,900 --> 01:25:58,358
<i>When do you come back?</i>

1253
01:25:58,567 --> 01:26:00,275
Soon, I'm afraid.

1254
01:26:00,483 --> 01:26:02,775
Paco's started
the divorce procedures.

1255
01:26:03,025 --> 01:26:05,650
Call me. I live to see you again.

1256
01:26:05,942 --> 01:26:07,275
I'll call you.

1257
01:26:07,650 --> 01:26:10,650
But I don't like you doing that
without telling me.

1258
01:26:12,317 --> 01:26:13,942
Not even Prince.

1259
01:26:14,108 --> 01:26:17,025
- I'm dead tired.
- I'm not surprised…

1260
01:26:18,108 --> 01:26:20,025
…considering your weight.

1261
01:26:37,692 --> 01:26:40,275
Angel, I'm grateful,
but I'm taking advantage of you.

1262
01:26:40,525 --> 01:26:42,942
I've done ghostwriting before.

1263
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:45,942
I've never had a ghostwriter before.

1264
01:26:46,108 --> 01:26:47,817
You'll get used to it.

1265
01:26:49,442 --> 01:26:50,733
What about you?

1266
01:26:50,942 --> 01:26:53,608
I always wanted to be
a romance writer.

1267
01:26:53,817 --> 01:26:55,275
You're so frivolous.

1268
01:26:55,483 --> 01:26:57,483
How long will your fun last?

1269
01:26:57,692 --> 01:26:59,775
Until the end of your contract.

1270
01:27:00,025 --> 01:27:02,108
What do you want in exchange?

1271
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:04,650
I wasn't thinking.

1272
01:27:04,858 --> 01:27:06,067
Think.

1273
01:27:06,608 --> 01:27:09,692
You keep 20 percent of the royalties,
like an agent.

1274
01:27:09,942 --> 01:27:13,025
And I'll take 80 percent.
Are you happy now?

1275
01:27:13,067 --> 01:27:15,650
Yes. Are you?

1276
01:27:15,900 --> 01:27:17,275
Me? If you are.

1277
01:30:05,442 --> 01:30:09,650
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming?

1278
01:30:09,858 --> 01:30:12,442
Why didn't you tell me
you were such a great artist?

1279
01:30:12,650 --> 01:30:14,900
I've been taking advantage of you.

1280
01:30:14,900 --> 01:30:17,733
- You've helped us very much.
- Me?

1281
01:30:17,733 --> 01:30:19,817
More than you think.

1282
01:30:23,483 --> 01:30:25,108
Excuse me.

1283
01:30:25,858 --> 01:30:27,650
You know each other?

1284
01:30:27,733 --> 01:30:29,858
- From the telephone.
- Really?

1285
01:30:30,192 --> 01:30:32,108
She keeps me informed.

1286
01:30:32,317 --> 01:30:34,483
- When did you get here?
- Just now.

1287
01:30:34,733 --> 01:30:36,317
I came here directly.

1288
01:30:36,483 --> 01:30:39,358
Blanca, you were amazing.
Simply amazing.

1289
01:30:39,567 --> 01:30:41,775
Amazing, amazing, amazing.

1290
01:30:41,983 --> 01:30:45,858
- You're so exaggerated. Antonio.
- And your son!

1291
01:30:46,275 --> 01:30:49,692
- My son?
- Amazing, amazing, amazing.

1292
01:30:49,733 --> 01:30:52,483
Antonio, come here.
Look who's here.

1293
01:31:09,942 --> 01:31:11,358
Anything wrong?

1294
01:31:11,775 --> 01:31:12,983
Nothing.

1295
01:31:13,483 --> 01:31:16,067
Nothing, no.

1296
01:31:16,608 --> 01:31:18,567
You were ecstatic in the theater.

1297
01:31:18,692 --> 01:31:20,775
And now you're about to cry.

1298
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:23,733
Is my company so unpleasant?

1299
01:31:24,817 --> 01:31:26,692
You reminded me of Paco.

1300
01:31:27,108 --> 01:31:29,275
We went to Athens three years ago.

1301
01:31:29,733 --> 01:31:32,900
It's not like Madrid.
There aren't many bars.

1302
01:31:33,817 --> 01:31:36,942
We were walking down the street,
and Paco began to play soccer…

1303
01:31:37,192 --> 01:31:39,775
…with some cardboard boxes.

1304
01:31:40,150 --> 01:31:42,400
He was like a little boy.

1305
01:31:42,942 --> 01:31:45,692
The only pleasant memory
I have from that trip.

1306
01:31:46,817 --> 01:31:50,983
Playing soccer is strictly forbidden.

1307
01:31:51,192 --> 01:31:53,650
From now on, only ballet.

1308
01:31:54,525 --> 01:31:56,775
If a top can spin…

1309
01:31:57,608 --> 01:32:00,025
…I can dance.

1310
01:32:46,025 --> 01:32:47,567
Did you hurt yourself?

1311
01:32:47,733 --> 01:32:51,817
- I've broken everything.
- Come on, please don't be silly.

1312
01:32:51,983 --> 01:32:54,983
Come on, help me. Up you go.

1313
01:33:03,192 --> 01:33:04,692
Better?

1314
01:33:04,900 --> 01:33:07,400
<i>Do you remember Casablanca?</i>

1315
01:33:08,567 --> 01:33:11,692
The first time Ingrid Bergman
enters Rick's?

1316
01:33:11,733 --> 01:33:15,192
They both sit down
at the same table.

1317
01:33:15,400 --> 01:33:19,442
Bogart is rigid,
speechless from emotion.

1318
01:33:19,692 --> 01:33:21,400
Ingrid asks him…

1319
01:33:21,608 --> 01:33:24,733
…if he remembers the last
time they'd been together.

1320
01:33:24,942 --> 01:33:27,192
It was in Paris.

1321
01:33:27,400 --> 01:33:29,733
He answers, stone-faced:

1322
01:33:29,942 --> 01:33:32,650
"I'll never forget that day."

1323
01:33:32,692 --> 01:33:35,858
The day the Germans
occupied Paris.

1324
01:33:36,025 --> 01:33:40,400
"The Germans wore gray,
and you wore blue."

1325
01:33:45,733 --> 01:33:50,692
You wore blue the day you fled
from your life and ran into mine.

1326
01:33:55,650 --> 01:33:57,608
I don't want to remember it.

1327
01:33:57,650 --> 01:33:59,567
I'll always remember it.

1328
01:34:01,733 --> 01:34:04,567
I'll take you home. You're drunk.

1329
01:34:05,150 --> 01:34:06,483
Stay with me.

1330
01:34:06,692 --> 01:34:09,192
No. I have to go home.

1331
01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:10,900
Alone?

1332
01:34:12,025 --> 01:34:14,483
You've become so strong.

1333
01:34:14,525 --> 01:34:16,567
I liked you better fragile.

1334
01:34:17,108 --> 01:34:18,775
I still am fragile.

1335
01:34:19,150 --> 01:34:21,233
My suitcases are still in the car.

1336
01:34:21,483 --> 01:34:23,525
I don't dare take them up.

1337
01:34:23,650 --> 01:34:26,067
I'm not strong at all.

1338
01:34:26,275 --> 01:34:29,233
But I have to learn to live there
without Paco.

1339
01:34:29,608 --> 01:34:31,650
Let's have a drink then.

1340
01:34:31,858 --> 01:34:33,525
It'll give you strength.

1341
01:34:35,233 --> 01:34:37,650
I also have to learn to live
without alcohol.

1342
01:34:38,150 --> 01:34:39,817
No Paco and no alcohol.

1343
01:34:40,650 --> 01:34:43,400
The sooner I start, the better.

1344
01:35:37,817 --> 01:35:39,775
I'm not going to answer.

1345
01:35:42,483 --> 01:35:44,483
<i>It's Antonio.</i>

1346
01:35:44,858 --> 01:35:47,858
<i>- Can I come up?
- Yes, Antonio.</i>

1347
01:35:51,858 --> 01:35:53,442
What's the matter?

1348
01:35:53,525 --> 01:35:55,567
My mother told me
to bring you this.

1349
01:35:55,775 --> 01:35:58,400
- At this hour?
- You know what she's like.

1350
01:35:58,442 --> 01:36:01,400
Whiskey! I've stopped drinking.

1351
01:36:01,650 --> 01:36:04,275
But I can start again if you join me.

1352
01:36:04,525 --> 01:36:06,108
Do you want a drink? Say yes.

1353
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:07,817
Yes, of course.

1354
01:36:08,067 --> 01:36:10,025
There's no ice. Do you mind?

1355
01:36:12,275 --> 01:36:13,983
Are you sleeping here tonight?

1356
01:36:14,192 --> 01:36:16,942
Yes. At least I'm going to try.

1357
01:36:17,150 --> 01:36:19,150
Alone?

1358
01:36:19,358 --> 01:36:21,567
Yes. Why?

1359
01:36:21,733 --> 01:36:24,317
Do you want me to stay?

1360
01:36:24,525 --> 01:36:28,567
Don't test me.
Drink up and go. Cheers.

1361
01:36:33,442 --> 01:36:36,525
I have to confess something to you.

1362
01:36:37,192 --> 01:36:38,400
Go ahead.

1363
01:36:38,983 --> 01:36:40,775
I stole some things from you.

1364
01:36:41,608 --> 01:36:45,108
- What?
- Some jewelry. Nothing important.

1365
01:36:45,400 --> 01:36:46,858
While I was away?

1366
01:36:47,067 --> 01:36:49,233
No, when you were here.

1367
01:36:49,442 --> 01:36:52,608
Taking advantage of your amnesia,
I took what I could.

1368
01:36:52,858 --> 01:36:56,233
I also took that novel
from the garbage can.

1369
01:36:56,442 --> 01:37:02,317
<i>The Cold-Storage one. I gave it to a
friend, who sold it to a movie producer.</i>

1370
01:37:02,358 --> 01:37:03,858
They're making a movie.

1371
01:37:05,650 --> 01:37:07,442
I read about it.

1372
01:37:09,233 --> 01:37:10,650
So it was you.

1373
01:37:10,942 --> 01:37:13,733
- But I'm not a thief.
- Of course not.

1374
01:37:13,942 --> 01:37:15,608
The money went to the show.

1375
01:37:16,275 --> 01:37:18,317
It was the only way
I could finance it.

1376
01:37:18,483 --> 01:37:20,317
I needed that chance.

1377
01:37:21,233 --> 01:37:23,608
Did your mother steal from me too?

1378
01:37:23,817 --> 01:37:26,025
My mother? She's anti-theft.

1379
01:37:26,692 --> 01:37:29,317
She got so angry
when she found out.

1380
01:37:30,233 --> 01:37:32,817
The day Mr. Paco came…

1381
01:37:32,983 --> 01:37:34,275
You found us arguing.

1382
01:37:34,858 --> 01:37:36,233
The day of the paella.

1383
01:37:36,442 --> 01:37:38,400
It was because she'd caught me.

1384
01:37:39,442 --> 01:37:41,650
She didn't even want to dance,

1385
01:37:42,108 --> 01:37:44,025
She loves you a hell of a lot.

1386
01:37:46,442 --> 01:37:47,567
I love her too.

1387
01:37:47,775 --> 01:37:51,067
She always reminds me
how much we owe you.

1388
01:37:52,817 --> 01:37:54,608
And you've come to pay?

1389
01:37:58,733 --> 01:38:02,067
How many fucks
will clear up the debt?

1390
01:38:02,608 --> 01:38:04,483
How much am I worth?

1391
01:38:04,692 --> 01:38:07,775
Please don't say
those things, ma'am.

1392
01:38:10,275 --> 01:38:12,733
I'll pay back every last peseta.

1393
01:38:12,942 --> 01:38:14,525
Don't worry about it.

1394
01:38:14,775 --> 01:38:18,817
You couldn't have invested better
than in that wonder I saw tonight.

1395
01:38:19,067 --> 01:38:21,108
You mean that?

1396
01:38:21,358 --> 01:38:23,233
Life is so incredible.

1397
01:38:23,275 --> 01:38:26,358
So cruel and so paradoxical.

1398
01:38:26,817 --> 01:38:29,525
So unpredictable
and sometimes so fair.

1399
01:38:30,317 --> 01:38:32,525
If you say it is.

1400
01:38:32,733 --> 01:38:35,900
Should I stay or should I go?

1401
01:38:36,108 --> 01:38:41,233
Go before I lose control and forget
that I'm a marvelous lady.

1402
01:38:47,317 --> 01:38:49,025
And thank you, Antonio.

1403
01:38:49,275 --> 01:38:50,442
Thank you? For what?

1404
01:38:50,692 --> 01:38:53,900
For giving meaning
to the darkest months in my life.

1405
01:38:54,108 --> 01:38:56,358
And for helping me forget Paco.

1406
01:38:56,567 --> 01:38:58,900
I haven't thought of him
for 15 minutes.

1407
01:39:30,067 --> 01:39:31,275
May I come in?

1408
01:39:32,275 --> 01:39:34,567
The things you ask.

1409
01:39:44,442 --> 01:39:47,275
<i>This reminds me of the end
of Rich and Famous.</i>

1410
01:39:48,108 --> 01:39:50,525
The two friends, writers…

1411
01:39:50,733 --> 01:39:53,275
…making a toast, alone…

1412
01:39:53,442 --> 01:39:55,900
…far from the world in front of afire.

1413
01:39:56,150 --> 01:39:58,650
But you don't drink…

1414
01:39:58,900 --> 01:40:02,733
…and it was New Year's Eve.
That's why they toasted.

1415
01:40:03,775 --> 01:40:07,275
Give me a drink,
and I'll make it New Year's Eve.

1416
01:40:25,483 --> 01:40:26,817
Kiss me.

1417
01:40:27,275 --> 01:40:31,192
If it's New Year's Eve,
I want contact with human flesh.

1418
01:40:32,067 --> 01:40:35,358
And you're the only flesh
around here.
