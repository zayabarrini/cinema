12
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:21,475
Hello.

13
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:24,019
<i>Hello, is this Ha-tau? This is Auntie.</i>

14
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:27,481
<i>You still asleep? I'll call you later.</i>

15
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,066
Okay.

16
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,253
<i>It's Auntie again.</i>

17
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:53,382
<i>You're still not up?
All right. I'll call you later.</i>

18
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:57,177
No, it's okay.
Go ahead.

19
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:02,307
<i>Your young cousin isn't feeling well
and has to see a doctor.</i>

20
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:04,142
<i>Instead of having her
travel back and forth,</i>

21
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:06,436
<i>I'm sending her to stay with you
for a few days, okay?</i>

22
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,272
I have a younger cousin?

23
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:12,651
<i>She's your second uncle's daughter,
Ah-Ngor.</i>

24
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:23,995
Who could that be?

25
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:39,511
I thought you were out.
I'm Ah-Ngor.

26
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:41,596
You're my cousin, right?

27
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,724
Come in. Make yourself at home.

28
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:45,767
There's the kitchen and bathroom.

29
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:49,938
Listen, if anyone calls,
tell them to call back later.

30
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:07,622
<i>Hello. Can I speak to Brother Wah?</i>

31
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,375
He's sleeping. Who's calling?

32
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:13,336
<i>Ha! You don't even know me,
so you must be new.</i>

33
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,963
<i>I'm Fly. Who are you?</i>

34
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,256
I'm his cousin.

35
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,717
<i>Cousin? Never mind.</i>

36
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,428
<i>Tell him I'm waiting
to do business with Fat Carl.</i>

37
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,638
<i>- Have him call me when he gets up.</i>
- Okay.

38
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,663
<i>Hello, cousin. Isn't Brother Wah up yet?</i>

39
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:34,417
Not yet. Is it urgent?
Want me to wake him up?

40
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,670
<i>No. When he gets up,</i>

41
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:39,256
<i>tell him I'm still waiting for Fat Carl.
Have him call me.</i>

42
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,799
Okay.

43
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,120
Go sleep in the bedroom if you're tired.

44
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:35,664
I'll sleep in the living room tonight.

45
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:45,363
Why do you wear that mask?

46
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:46,865
So I don't infect other people.

47
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:51,573
What kind of disease is it?

48
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,830
The doctor said
my lungs are malfunctioning

49
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,373
and told me to see a specialist.

50
00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:00,003
Don't worry. You're not gonna die.

51
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,591
Just eat more oranges and you'll be fine.

52
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,347
Tastes strange.

53
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:23,068
A guy named Fly
called a couple times for you.

54
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:27,614
Really? What did he say?

55
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,120
<i>Hello, little cousin. Is he up yet?</i>

56
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,081
Hello.

57
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,084
<i>I'm at Fat Carl's place,
collecting what he owes.</i>

58
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:41,044
You're kidding! What's taking you so long?

59
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,630
He's jerking you around.
Stay there. I'll be right over.

60
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:59,646
I can't have dinner with you tonight.
You'll have to go out on your own.

61
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,567
Here, get yourself something to eat.

62
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,152
The key's under the mat.

63
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,823
And take that thing off. It's ugly.

64
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:23,837
Have a cup of tea first.

65
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:30,969
Fat Carl, I'm telling you,

66
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:34,139
I'm doing you a favor
talking with you this long.

67
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:39,144
If I'm not well-known,
it's not 'cause I'm a weakling.

68
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:41,771
My big brother tells me
to keep a low profile.

69
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:43,815
You know Airplane?

70
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:47,444
He ran up $1,600 in debt
and was just two days late in paying.

71
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,988
Now he can't fly,
and he has to use a wheelchair.

72
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:52,991
I did that with my own two hands.

73
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:56,119
You trying to scare me?

74
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:59,330
Airplane's a nobody!
You can't compare him to me!

75
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:00,999
Let me tell you something!

76
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,918
Fat Carl doesn't pay debts!

77
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:07,589
You know that guy called Tubby?
He was a lot tougher than you.

78
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,257
Now they call him Skinny.

79
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,967
You know why?

80
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,927
He tried to collect too,

81
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:14,596
and I beat him half to death.

82
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,431
He's only got one eye left now.

83
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:21,311
You been at this just two years
and you have the nerve to come to me?

84
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,731
I got more knife scars
than you have hairs on your legs!

85
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:28,234
Scars? My big brother's only got one,
so I'll cut myself if you have any!

86
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,612
Then start cutting!

87
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,615
Aren't you guys finished yet?

88
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,492
We're just getting started.

89
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,994
Just getting started after this long?

90
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:40,955
Nobody move!

91
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:43,416
You gonna pay what you owe?

92
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:46,669
Yeah!

93
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:47,754
I never said I wouldn't!

94
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:52,342
I can't believe it was that easy.

95
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:55,178
I could tell he was
a sheep in wolf's clothing.

96
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,847
If they had any guts,
they would have jumped you.

97
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:58,932
You're right.

98
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,934
- Here.
- Thank you.

99
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:13,738
Hey, Brother Wah.

100
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,658
Here to see Mabel?

101
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:19,702
- She's not here yet.
- I'll wait for her downstairs.

102
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:46,729
Mabel!

103
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,191
Come here.

104
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:54,237
I haven't eaten yet. Will you join me?

105
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,659
It's okay if you don't want to.

106
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,208
- Why were you so late for work?
- I just got out of the hospital.

107
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:11,337
The hospital? Why?
Did they pump your stomach again?

108
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:13,256
I had an abortion!

109
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:19,679
Is this a joke?

110
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:21,431
Take it that way if you want.

111
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:27,770
Why didn't you tell me you were pregnant?

112
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:29,647
Did you ever give me a chance?

113
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:31,858
Three days I waited, but you never called!

114
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:35,737
You could have called me.

115
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:39,199
Call you? To say what?

116
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:41,618
That you should marry me?
That I'm getting an abortion?

117
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,537
We were together six years,
and what did I get in the end?

118
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:48,458
You're still not mine,
and I'm not even better off for it.

119
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,544
I'm so poor I had to borrow
from my mother for the abortion.

120
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:54,088
- And what for?
- Are you done?

121
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:00,178
You knew what kind of guy I was
from the day we met!

122
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:05,433
Don't stay with me
if it's marriage and money you're after!

123
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,771
Don't think I'll feel sorry forever
'cause you got an abortion.

124
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,481
I won't.

125
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,441
You say that now, but I know you will!

126
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:18,488
So you don't give a damn about me?
Fine!

127
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:19,989
I destroyed your baby!

128
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,284
And I'm gonna tell everyone
that I had your baby aborted,

129
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:25,248
so you'll feel guilty
for the rest of your life!

130
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,542
Congratulations.

131
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,628
You win!

132
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,003
Cousin.

133
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:19,590
Are you all right?

134
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:45,408
Cousin.

135
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,748
What's the matter, cousin?

136
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,043
Did you break up with someone?

137
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:01,674
What did you say?

138
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:07,722
What did you say?

139
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,607
I'm warning you...

140
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:20,443
never say those words again...

141
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:22,987
or I'll throw you out.

142
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,480
Did you see the doctor?

143
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:41,441
I just came back from the hospital.

144
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,153
What did he say?

145
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,363
I get the results tomorrow.

146
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,251
Have you eaten yet?
Let's go get something.

147
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:03,504
I cooked.

148
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,892
Fly called for you again this morning.

149
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,479
What did that rat say?

150
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:23,441
Nothing special.
Just small talk.

151
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:26,736
Didn't he ask anything about me?

152
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,446
Like what?

153
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,492
Like what happened last night.

154
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:38,581
He just asked one question.

155
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:43,836
One question?
What was it?

156
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:46,631
I'm afraid to tell you.

157
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:50,218
Just tell me what he said.

158
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,261
You sure?

159
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,265
He asked, if you broke up.

160
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:12,406
You've been in all day.
Why don't you go out?

161
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:15,493
No place to go.

162
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:18,287
I've got no friends in Kowloon.

163
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:26,337
Finish up
and I'll take you out.

164
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:40,476
Are you in school, or do you work?

165
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:43,521
I'm working already.

166
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:44,981
What kind of job?

167
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:47,400
In a friend's restaurant.

168
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:49,986
Is he your boyfriend?

169
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,283
Not really.

170
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:57,034
Everybody calls him Uncle Tang.

171
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:03,499
Hey, let's go see a movie later.

172
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:06,502
If you're free.
Don't feel you have to keep me company.

173
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,990
Are you the backup?

174
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,161
Ah-Site, how much did you lose?

175
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,079
Five hundred.

176
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:47,501
I won't play for that little.

177
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:51,297
Let's settle this with one game...
for a grand.

178
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,507
You in?

179
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:55,426
A grand?

180
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:57,470
What do you say, Snooker King?

181
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:00,931
I should show you my stuff
for a grand?

182
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:03,809
I'll play you one-handed for two grand.

183
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,686
One-handed?

184
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:07,813
You're on!

185
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:10,733
Ah-Site.

186
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,654
Piece of cake.

187
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,338
Another ball in the pocket.
How about that?

188
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,268
Snooker King is really great!

189
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:57,321
Ah-Site, how many points am I behind?

190
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:03,494
No need to count.
He's 30 points ahead.

191
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:06,122
He'll still be five ahead
even if you knock all the rest in.

192
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,581
What do you say?

193
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,626
This calls for a special cue.

194
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:15,339
Ah-Site,
my special cue.

195
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,644
Come on.

196
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,273
"This little piggie went to market"...

197
00:20:33,274 --> 00:20:34,859
Step aside.

198
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:37,236
"This little piggie stayed home"...

199
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,406
Give us some room.

200
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,200
"This little piggie had roast beef"...

201
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:46,245
We need to set up this shot.

202
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:54,920
Too easy. Let's make it harder for him.

203
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:59,425
Watch out.
You just lost seven points.

204
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:00,634
Take your shot.

205
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:05,014
Shoot!

206
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,391
You take me for a fool?

207
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:12,229
Watch out!

208
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:14,648
- You okay?
- Run!

209
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,050
Come on, you idiot!

210
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,928
Stop!

211
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:45,805
Stop!

212
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:55,397
Out of the way, damn it!

213
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:02,112
What the hell!

214
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:17,962
Die!

215
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:34,603
To hell with you!

216
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:53,539
Big Brother!

217
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:57,668
Big Brother!

218
00:22:58,627 --> 00:22:59,837
Big Brother!

219
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:24,445
Ready?

220
00:23:26,697 --> 00:23:27,698
Yeah.

221
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,183
Shut up!

222
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:11,088
Are you all right?

223
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:13,382
Yeah, I'm okay.

224
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,481
Why don't you go to sleep? It's late.

225
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:14,651
<i>Cousin, the report said my health is fine.</i>

226
00:28:15,152 --> 00:28:17,446
<i>I wanted to stay and celebrate with you,</i>

227
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:20,574
<i>but Auntie said the weather's nice,
so the restaurant's busy.</i>

228
00:28:21,325 --> 00:28:23,285
<i>Uncle Tang wanted me to get back earlier.</i>

229
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:26,496
<i>I called your name twice,
but you didn't answer.</i>

230
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,457
<i>You must have been very tired.</i>

231
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,042
<i>Summer's coming,</i>

232
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,586
<i>and lots of people
will vacation on Lantau Island.</i>

233
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:34,922
<i>Do you get vacations in your line of work?</i>

234
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:37,841
<i>I made a meal for you in the kitchen.</i>

235
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:40,469
<i>I also bought a few more glasses.</i>

236
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:43,680
<i>I knew they'd all get broken
sooner or later,</i>

237
00:28:43,764 --> 00:28:45,224
<i>so I hid one of them.</i>

238
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:47,726
<i>One day, when you need that glass,</i>

239
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:51,230
<i>give me a call,
and I'll tell you where it's hidden.</i>

240
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:52,898
<i>Bye-bye. Ah-Ngor</i>

241
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:31,812
Hey, everybody!

242
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:37,359
Turn that down!

243
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:47,244
Honored relatives and guests,

244
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:50,080
today is my brother Ah-Site's wedding day.

245
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:53,166
We've prepared
some modest food to serve you.

246
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,334
So drink up.

247
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:55,711
To my brother!

248
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:01,800
See, I told you $200 was too much!

249
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:03,885
Who knew he was so cheap
he'd have it on the roof?

250
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:05,971
Please help yourselves.

251
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:08,056
After you.

252
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,689
Stop acting like that. After you.

253
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:17,190
Look this way.

254
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:21,153
One more!

255
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:22,362
That's enough!

256
00:30:22,446 --> 00:30:26,033
Go get your in-laws
for a picture.

257
00:30:26,116 --> 00:30:28,160
Hurry up. Go!

258
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,918
- Father, will you join us for a picture?
- No.

259
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:39,087
- Come on, Father.
- No.

260
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:44,468
Don't be like that.
Come have your picture taken.

261
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:46,678
No. What's the point?

262
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:48,221
This is a disgrace!

263
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:52,267
Hurry up and finish
before I pass out from the heat.

264
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:54,227
Don't be like that.

265
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:56,980
You don't hold a reception
if you don't have the money.

266
00:30:57,064 --> 00:31:00,108
Unheard of,
having it on the roof!

267
00:31:05,906 --> 00:31:07,407
I just can't get through to you.

268
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:10,577
Can't you ever do anything right?

269
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:15,248
This is your brother's big day.
Why did you make it so shabby?

270
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:18,502
Think I didn't want to do it up big?

271
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:20,629
But I've got no money. What could I do?

272
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:25,842
He complains too much.

273
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:41,983
Shithead.

274
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:44,444
What did you say?

275
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,863
What did I say?

276
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:49,157
I said you're a shithead!

277
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:51,660
I served you shark's fin
and abalone, didn't I?

278
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:54,389
So what if there's no air conditioning?
Why complain so much?

279
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:57,999
If you ask me,
this good food is wasted on you!

280
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:01,628
I only served abalone
'cause your son-in-law said you loved it.

281
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:03,880
Had I known you were such a jerk,

282
00:32:03,964 --> 00:32:07,050
I'd have served you shit instead!

283
00:32:07,134 --> 00:32:09,928
You want to die?
Don't you dare throw things at me!

284
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,805
Let me go! I'll kill him!

285
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:14,683
- You wanna fight?
- Big Brother, don't!

286
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,560
Wanna fight, do you?

287
00:32:17,227 --> 00:32:19,813
What are you doing? Get out of here!

288
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:22,816
And you keep quiet!

289
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:25,569
Get lost!

290
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:27,779
Sit down! Sit!

291
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:31,908
Was I right or what?
A real shithead, isn't he?

292
00:32:31,992 --> 00:32:34,536
- You arguing with your big brother?
- Isn't he a bastard?

293
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,997
Go on talking, I dare you!

294
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:43,587
After all, he is Ah-Site's father-in-law.

295
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:48,091
You're making things hard
for your little brother.

296
00:32:48,175 --> 00:32:52,220
All right, it's my fault.
I'm in the wrong.

297
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:00,145
Younger brother...

298
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:04,191
I've done you wrong.

299
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:07,819
Someday when I strike it rich...

300
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,740
I'll throw you another banquet.

301
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,923
<i>I knew it was our turn,</i>

302
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,758
<i>but it all happened so quickly.</i>

303
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,968
<i>The cops arrested our guys last night.</i>

304
00:33:32,052 --> 00:33:34,596
If it had just been the small-fries,
then no big deal,

305
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,556
but Big-Mouth Kay handles the money.

306
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:48,443
They say the cops
are making a deal with him.

307
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:51,404
They'll help him out if he squeals on us.

308
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:54,449
It could be really serious.

309
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:56,743
So Godfather sent me to tell you

310
00:33:56,826 --> 00:34:00,205
not to make any unnecessary trouble
these days.

311
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:05,001
Hey, the police are outside.

312
00:34:05,085 --> 00:34:07,212
Any of you bastards got drugs and weapons,

313
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:09,256
go take care of them, quick.

314
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:13,343
Ah-Wah, you've got a visitor outside.

315
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:14,553
Thanks.

316
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:22,602
- What brings you here?
- I gotta talk to you.

317
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:25,272
Your brother Fly owes us.

318
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:28,733
He's missed a couple payments
and doesn't return our calls.

319
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,528
My big brother sent me to tell you

320
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:35,282
if he doesn't pay by tomorrow,
he gets no more chances.

321
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:40,245
Tell Tony I can take care of my own guys.

322
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:43,123
I'll talk to Fly about the money.

323
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:46,209
If this is true,
I'll bring him to see Tony tomorrow.

324
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:58,179
Did you wanna see me?

325
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:05,395
You been hard up for money recently?

326
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:10,650
I'm always hard up for money.

327
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:16,281
But I'm used to it.
I've got big prospects.

328
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:21,036
A fortune-teller told me
I'd strike it rich by 30.

329
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,871
Everything's gonna be great.

330
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:25,373
I'll be sitting pretty.

331
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:27,083
Won't need to hang around here.

332
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:32,797
Did this fortune-teller also mention
you won't make it to 30?

333
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:34,466
No.

334
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:38,053
I heard you borrowed money from Tony.

335
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:43,767
What are you saying?

336
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,435
That's English.

337
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:47,646
You know I don't understand English,
so why speak it?

338
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:52,484
I'll ask you again.
Did you borrow money from Tony?

339
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:53,943
No.

340
00:35:55,195 --> 00:35:57,656
Then why are they looking for you?

341
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:00,241
They're eating around the corner.

342
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:02,243
- Want me to have 'em come over?
- Fine.

343
00:36:09,459 --> 00:36:10,960
Who are you winking at?

344
00:36:12,379 --> 00:36:13,880
How much did you borrow?

345
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:16,299
How much?

346
00:36:17,384 --> 00:36:19,552
Not much. Take it easy.

347
00:36:19,636 --> 00:36:21,262
"Not much" is still money.

348
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:22,764
How much?

349
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:26,393
Couple hundred bucks. No big deal.
Don't listen to them.

350
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:28,770
They wouldn't come to me
for a couple hundred bucks.

351
00:36:31,231 --> 00:36:32,732
You gonna tell me?

352
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:40,323
A wedding banquet
and a gift for the bride.

353
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:41,825
You figure it out.

354
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,551
There's 8,000.

355
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:04,389
Eight thousand?

356
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:07,934
You counting every dollar of that as two?

357
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:12,355
That's what he said he owed.

358
00:37:13,523 --> 00:37:16,443
Eight thousand was the principal.
What about the rest?

359
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:19,070
He's missed four payments.

360
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:23,408
He owed us 13,500 and change.

361
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:24,743
I'm doing you a favor.

362
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:26,202
Why don't you go rob a bank?

363
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:32,292
Who do you think you are,
talking to me like that?

364
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:33,752
You're awful fond of talking.

365
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:36,713
Ah-Kwong, take him in there
and have a nice long chat with him.

366
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:39,048
- We'll talk about your mother!
- Shut up!

367
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:41,092
Get out of here!

368
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:43,786
Get out!

369
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:58,193
Your brother's lucky
he's working under you.

370
00:37:59,027 --> 00:38:00,945
Anyone else and he'd be dead by now.

371
00:38:02,155 --> 00:38:03,656
Let's cut the small talk.

372
00:38:04,574 --> 00:38:06,326
Enough beating around the bush.

373
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:10,163
Well?

374
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:11,831
First, I've paid off the principal,

375
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:14,501
but he really doesn't have the interest.

376
00:38:14,584 --> 00:38:16,544
We'll have to postpone two more payments.

377
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:19,631
Two more? Why not just wait till I'm dead
and burn it as an offering?

378
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:24,594
If you don't trust him, trust me.
I'm good for it.

379
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:27,889
But I don't have the money now.

380
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,808
I'll give it to you in a couple days.

381
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:35,647
How can you be a big brother
if you don't even have that much?

382
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,649
Better go be a farmer or something.

383
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:41,110
I thought you had money,
so I agreed to talk to you.

384
00:38:41,945 --> 00:38:44,572
You're a sorry excuse for a big brother.

385
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,998
You really want it now?

386
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:59,212
- What? You're crazy.
- What?

387
00:38:59,629 --> 00:39:01,506
Sure, I'll take it if you have it now.

388
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:06,845
Okay. Let me make a call first.

389
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,399
Why are you just sitting there?

390
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:21,818
Your boss told you to talk with me,
so talk!

391
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:23,963
What's your father's name?
What's your mother called?

392
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:25,738
Stop joking around, Fly.

393
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:28,491
Why don't you talk to me?
Don't you have any parents?

394
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:36,291
Are you the boss?

395
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:41,004
Stay back!

396
00:39:42,005 --> 00:39:46,134
I have a little problem.
Could you lend me some money?

397
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,510
Yes, I could.

398
00:39:47,594 --> 00:39:48,928
Fly.

399
00:39:51,598 --> 00:39:53,933
I'm borrowing the money from your boss.

400
00:39:54,017 --> 00:39:55,852
You can take it or leave it,

401
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:58,438
but there's no debt between us
from now on.

402
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:02,483
If I get rich someday,
I'll pay you back.

403
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:05,862
You were wrong to help this guy
rip us off at high interest! Right?

404
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:06,946
Right!

405
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:09,115
What are you waiting for?
Give Tony the money.

406
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:10,700
We're even now.

407
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:16,664
And here's a little extra,
my gift to you.

408
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:24,839
Think you're tough, huh?
Shafting me in my own place!

409
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:29,677
You're something yourself,
taking us for fools.

410
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:31,888
Come here a minute.

411
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:34,182
Let's go.

412
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:46,694
Tony, I pay you to guard this place,

413
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:49,530
not to bring in hoodlums to rob me!

414
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:51,366
What's the meaning of this?

415
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,952
Boss, he just lost his temper.

416
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:12,303
Things are heating up on the street,

417
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:14,472
and you two are still at each other!

418
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:16,432
Don't you have any respect for me?

419
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:19,018
He started it.

420
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:22,021
First he refuses to pay his debt,

421
00:41:22,105 --> 00:41:24,524
then he causes trouble in my place
and robs my boss.

422
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:28,152
He's been wrong all the way
down the line, Godfather.

423
00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:31,739
You knew he was crazy.
You shouldn't have bugged him!

424
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:35,952
And you've gone too far,
taking advantage of him.

425
00:41:37,704 --> 00:41:39,956
You knew that was his turf.

426
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:44,085
Godfather, I was just trying
to pay him back.

427
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:48,673
He wanted the money back, so I gave it.
It was a fair exchange.

428
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:51,843
- Fair?
- What are you doing?

429
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:54,554
I'm still the one
who makes the decisions around here!

430
00:41:54,637 --> 00:42:00,727
Damn it! Just make your payment every month,
and that settles that!

431
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:02,270
Now shake on it!

432
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:08,693
Well? I told you to shake on it.

433
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:10,111
Do it!

434
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:12,113
Shake!

435
00:42:17,827 --> 00:42:20,329
That traitor Ah-Kay is a snitch.

436
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:22,874
We can't let him live.

437
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:26,085
You gotta kill him
before he goes to court.

438
00:42:26,169 --> 00:42:27,420
What do you say?

439
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:31,382
It's a tough job.
Who should we send?

440
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:35,720
I don't want an outsider handling this.
Here's what we'll do.

441
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:40,892
You two find some smart boys
to draw lots day after tomorrow.

442
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:47,315
This guy's perfect.
He acts all tough and brave.

443
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,984
Send your younger brother,
if he wants to do it.

444
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:51,444
I'll cancel his debt,

445
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:54,489
and we'll look after his family,
if he dies.

446
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:55,740
You got the guts?

447
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:58,034
What? You trying to scare me?

448
00:42:58,618 --> 00:43:00,036
Shut up.

449
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:05,541
Don't pick on the little guys.
You and me are the best here.

450
00:43:06,042 --> 00:43:08,336
It's either you or me.

451
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:10,463
I'll do it if you won't.

452
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:12,298
Just say the word and I'll take it.

453
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:17,678
You'll have to do it,
if you don't speak up.

454
00:43:18,221 --> 00:43:20,431
Say you don't want to
and admit you're a coward.

455
00:43:20,515 --> 00:43:22,308
Then I'll take it on!

456
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:24,352
Stop dreaming!

457
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:27,271
You two ganging up on me?

458
00:43:27,355 --> 00:43:30,024
Fine! I'll kill you two first!

459
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:32,026
Not again! Stop arguing!

460
00:43:32,652 --> 00:43:35,988
I have my own idea how to handle this.
Now get out of here, all of you.

461
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,366
Good-bye, Godfather.

462
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:42,161
<i>Ah-Wah, come back here.</i>

463
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:45,540
What is it?

464
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:49,043
I know you and your brother
are good friends.

465
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:50,878
But he's too crazy.

466
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:54,757
Straighten him out.
He's like a time bomb.

467
00:43:54,841 --> 00:43:56,843
One of these days he'll get you killed.

468
00:43:56,926 --> 00:43:58,261
I know.

469
00:43:59,262 --> 00:44:00,638
I've thought about that.

470
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:02,849
I want to find him a normal job.

471
00:44:02,932 --> 00:44:04,142
Good idea.

472
00:44:04,267 --> 00:44:07,395
Fish balls!

473
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:12,775
That's it for today. Time to go home!

474
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:15,486
Brother Wah is here.

475
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:21,450
Help me out here.

476
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:31,043
Fish balls!
Get your fish balls!

477
00:44:33,254 --> 00:44:35,840
- Hey, Big Brother.
- Give me one. How's it going?

478
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:38,384
How do you think?

479
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:40,928
Think I can't handle a food cart?

480
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:43,723
You know who you're talking to.

481
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:50,479
Take it slow.
You'll move up into the big time.

482
00:44:50,563 --> 00:44:53,399
Right. Fish balls here today,

483
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:56,360
bombs in the Middle East tomorrow.

484
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:58,654
- You jerk!
- Police!

485
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:02,700
Stop!

486
00:45:03,993 --> 00:45:05,203
The police are coming!

487
00:45:05,286 --> 00:45:07,038
Who gives a shit?

488
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:09,415
Hey, fish ball man! Is this your cart?

489
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:11,209
- What did you call me?
- Fish ball man.

490
00:45:11,292 --> 00:45:12,501
What?

491
00:45:12,585 --> 00:45:15,254
If you don't sell fish balls,
what's with those scissors?

492
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:18,341
Scissors mean I sell fish balls?
Are you crazy?

493
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:19,967
I'm just trimming my nose hairs.

494
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:25,181
- So it's not your cart. Take it away!
- Fine! Take it!

495
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:28,684
Hey, what are you doing?
That cart cost money!

496
00:45:28,768 --> 00:45:30,978
Saving face is what matters, not money.

497
00:45:31,062 --> 00:45:33,564
I may not be famous,
but people here know me.

498
00:45:33,648 --> 00:45:35,524
I don't want to sell fish balls!

499
00:45:35,608 --> 00:45:36,901
I have to live around here!

500
00:45:39,195 --> 00:45:42,448
Out of my way!
You don't own the sidewalk!

501
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:46,285
It's just a job! No need to be ashamed!

502
00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:47,995
I don't like selling fish balls!

503
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:50,122
Then what do you want to sell?

504
00:45:50,206 --> 00:45:52,833
You can't just hang around
doing nothing.

505
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:54,460
You're not cut out for the gang!

506
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:57,922
Yeah, I know!
I'm Mr. Fish Balls!

507
00:45:59,215 --> 00:46:01,050
Fine! I'll do it 'cause you say so,

508
00:46:01,801 --> 00:46:04,929
but when I can't stand it anymore,
I'm gonna poison the fish balls!

509
00:46:09,058 --> 00:46:10,601
It's for your own good!

510
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:32,748
What a coincidence.

511
00:46:32,832 --> 00:46:34,250
Yeah.

512
00:46:37,837 --> 00:46:39,171
How are you?

513
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,215
Fine.

514
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:48,306
I got married.

515
00:46:55,688 --> 00:46:57,023
Good for you.

516
00:46:58,107 --> 00:46:59,608
Does your husband treat you well?

517
00:47:00,443 --> 00:47:01,777
Very well.

518
00:47:07,033 --> 00:47:08,993
It's really pouring.
No telling when it'll stop.

519
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:11,912
I'm waiting for my husband.

520
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:16,751
Want a cigarette?

521
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:18,127
I don't smoke anymore.

522
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:33,309
It's not yours.

523
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:39,106
Well, gotta go.

524
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:58,125
<i>Hello, may I help you?</i>

525
00:47:58,209 --> 00:47:59,335
Is Ah-Ngor there?

526
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:01,670
<i>No, she's not. Who's calling?</i>

527
00:48:03,631 --> 00:48:05,758
That's all right. Thanks.

528
00:48:21,524 --> 00:48:27,279
<i>Longing for you like
The never ending ocean waves</i>

529
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:44,922
<i>Longing for you like
The never ending ocean waves</i>

530
00:48:48,717 --> 00:48:55,349
<i>A passion in my heart
That can no longer be contained</i>

531
00:48:58,477 --> 00:49:05,109
<i>Though I'm still alone
I hesitate to give my heart away</i>

532
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:14,702
<i>Your seductive gaze, like flame
Ignites the embers of love</i>

533
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:20,875
<i>Take my breath away</i>

534
00:49:26,547 --> 00:49:30,009
<i>Take my breath away</i>

535
00:49:40,436 --> 00:49:42,188
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

536
00:49:42,271 --> 00:49:43,564
Is Ah-Ngor here?

537
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:46,275
She went to Kowloon and isn't back yet.

538
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:48,861
- Kowloon?
- Yes.

539
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:52,823
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

540
00:49:56,744 --> 00:50:02,750
<i>Awaiting you in darkness

00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:15,054

543
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:18,766

544
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:30,152

545
00:50:30,236 --> 00:50:34,281

00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:39,828

00:50:39,912 --> 00:50:43,916
<i>Whether we have a future or not</i>

548
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:46,377
When did you get here?

549
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:49,505
Just now.

550
00:50:54,927 --> 00:50:56,428
You've put on a little weight.

551
00:50:59,557 --> 00:51:00,891
A little.

552
00:51:01,517 --> 00:51:02,851
So have you.

553
00:51:03,978 --> 00:51:06,897
It's all because of him.
He's my doctor.

554
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:14,238
You staying out here tonight?

555
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:16,907
No.

556
00:51:17,825 --> 00:51:19,368
I'm heading back now.

557
00:51:27,668 --> 00:51:29,086
Ah-Ngor.

558
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:33,299
I just wanted to say...

559
00:51:34,717 --> 00:51:36,176
I found that glass.

560
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:40,222
<i>Take my breath away</i>

561
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:49,106

566
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:34,568
<i>Miss Cheung called for you just now.</i>

567
00:52:34,652 --> 00:52:37,655
<i>She's going to the wharf.
You should wait for her there.</i>

568
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:49,333

It's just like a moth to the flame</i>

578
00:53:53,689 --> 00:54:00,529
<i>Awaiting you in darkness

579

<i>Take my breath away</i>

582
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:45,282
Go get some sleep.
I'll check you in tomorrow.

583
00:54:46,909 --> 00:54:48,076
Okay.

584
00:55:07,095 --> 00:55:08,764
When do you start work in the morning?

585
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:12,267
Very early.
I'll make breakfast for you.

586
00:55:13,894 --> 00:55:15,312
Okay.

587
00:55:19,525 --> 00:55:21,026
How long are you staying?

588
00:55:23,195 --> 00:55:24,530
I'm not sure.

589
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:42,965
I should go.

590
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:46,468
I'll walk you home.

591
00:55:46,552 --> 00:55:48,554
That's okay. It's not far.

592
00:55:50,973 --> 00:55:52,683
Could you maybe not go home tonight?

593
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:58,146
Why didn't you visit me until now?

594
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:04,152
I know myself and my work.

595
00:56:06,113 --> 00:56:07,948
I can't promise you anything.

596
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:12,536
When you're not on my mind...

597
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:18,000
you won't see me.

598
00:56:20,252 --> 00:56:21,962
If you had waited any longer,

599
00:56:22,588 --> 00:56:24,381
I'd probably have married that doctor.

600
00:57:29,613 --> 00:57:32,658
Mr. Fish Balls, give me
a dollar's worth with extra sauce.

601
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:41,083
Well?

602
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:44,544
Why don't you take it?
You said you wanted extra sauce!

603
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:47,506
Take it or I'm gonna get pissed!

604
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,387
"Mr. Fish Balls"!

605
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:54,721
Bastard!

606
00:57:56,181 --> 00:58:00,644
That can't be Fly, can it?
What's happened?

607
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:02,688
You haven't sunk
to selling fish balls, have you?

608
00:58:02,771 --> 00:58:03,981
Poor guy.

609
00:58:04,398 --> 00:58:06,066
What a loser.

610
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:09,111
Your big brother
must have put you up to this.

611
00:58:09,695 --> 00:58:11,863
You should leave him.

612
00:58:11,947 --> 00:58:13,365
Look at my guys.

613
00:58:13,824 --> 00:58:15,904
All dressed up and suave,
with their own cell phones.

614
00:58:15,951 --> 00:58:17,744
They don't have to do this.

615
00:58:17,828 --> 00:58:19,329
Poor bastard.

616
00:58:19,413 --> 00:58:21,773
Your big brother's got you selling
fish balls in the street.

617
00:58:21,832 --> 00:58:23,500
Working for me is better.

618
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:24,876
Police!

619
00:58:29,256 --> 00:58:31,008
What are you running for?
You're a gangster!

620
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:32,777
Your brothers are here.
No need to be afraid.

621
00:58:32,801 --> 00:58:34,177
Take him!

622
00:58:36,263 --> 00:58:38,932
Don't worry,
you'll be okay in jail.

623
00:58:39,016 --> 00:58:41,435
Fight back if they beat you.
Don't let us lose face!

624
00:58:42,144 --> 00:58:43,478
Bastard!

625
00:58:43,979 --> 00:58:46,189
Take it easy. It's okay.

626
00:58:46,273 --> 00:58:49,026
You weren't selling drugs,
just fish balls!

627
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:52,738
- Let's watch the show!
- Asshole!

628
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:40,869
Stop, you bastard!

629
00:59:42,454 --> 00:59:43,914
Hold it there!

630
01:00:02,182 --> 01:00:04,351
Bring him here!

631
01:00:09,648 --> 01:00:11,066
I'm gonna kill you!

632
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:15,529
Hey, leave some for me.

633
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:20,158
How many chicken wings in two boxes?

634
01:00:21,576 --> 01:00:23,120
About 300.

635
01:00:24,538 --> 01:00:25,956
About 300?

636
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:30,085
- And you used to carry this?
- Yeah.

637
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:35,006
You let your boss know
he had better watch out.

638
01:00:35,799 --> 01:00:39,427
He shouldn't have you lifting heavy stuff,

639
01:00:39,511 --> 01:00:42,848
or he'll get a knuckle sandwich
for every wing in the box!

640
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,684
- You're crazy.
- I'm crazy?

641
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:53,650
- Don't you want my help?
- It's okay. I'm quitting anyway.

642
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:55,026
Quitting?

643
01:00:57,445 --> 01:00:58,697
Why?

644
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:01,825
I want to find a job in Kowloon.

645
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:06,079
That's fine with me. You can move in.

646
01:01:08,456 --> 01:01:09,916
Better not say that again.

647
01:01:10,792 --> 01:01:12,878
Once you've said it twice,
you can't take it back.

648
01:01:14,254 --> 01:01:15,589
I'm not kidding.

649
01:01:17,174 --> 01:01:18,758
If I leave, I'm never coming back.

650
01:01:30,228 --> 01:01:31,730
Hey, what do you want to eat?

651
01:01:40,947 --> 01:01:43,408
Tell him I'll be there on time.

652
01:01:43,992 --> 01:01:46,703
If he hurts Fly, he'll pay for it.
That's all.

653
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:50,290
What's the matter?

654
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:52,792
Nothing special.
Fly's in trouble and I've gotta go.

655
01:01:52,876 --> 01:01:54,169
Is it dangerous?

656
01:01:54,252 --> 01:01:57,297
No, it's all right.
I'll be back tonight. Don't worry.

657
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:09,202
Why are all these people here, Uncle Kwan?

658
01:03:09,286 --> 01:03:12,497
Fly's in the wrong this time.

659
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:15,458
But let's not make a big deal of it.
We're all friends here.

660
01:03:16,251 --> 01:03:18,461
Apologize to Tony and it'll all be over.

661
01:03:18,545 --> 01:03:20,422
Go on now.

662
01:03:29,055 --> 01:03:32,642
Tony,
whatever Fly did,

663
01:03:32,726 --> 01:03:34,269
I'll punish him my way.

664
01:03:34,853 --> 01:03:36,493
So please give me back my little brother.

665
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:39,649
Your little brother?
Which one?

666
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:42,986
That one?
You like to protect your "little brother"?

667
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:44,946
Then protect it!

668
01:03:45,697 --> 01:03:49,409
You think I'm a fool?
I'd understand if he were worth it!

669
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:50,744
But he's a piece of shit!

670
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:52,746
How can you be a big brother?

671
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:55,707
Tony, he tried to set things right.
Let it go.

672
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:57,334
Save it, Uncle Kwan.

673
01:03:57,417 --> 01:03:59,210
I'm helping him grow up.

674
01:04:00,003 --> 01:04:02,172
If his guy can treat me like this,

675
01:04:02,881 --> 01:04:04,549
then where do you stand in the future?

676
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:07,761
Sure, I'll let him go.

677
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:11,389
But humor me.
I don't ask much.

678
01:04:11,473 --> 01:04:14,559
Just say one thing to make me happy
and I'll let him go.

679
01:04:20,231 --> 01:04:22,734
Satisfied now?
Wanna keep your "little brother"?

680
01:04:44,255 --> 01:04:45,673
Big Brother.

681
01:04:51,054 --> 01:04:52,472
Bastard!

682
01:04:55,058 --> 01:04:55,958
Can you walk?

683
01:04:58,228 --> 01:04:59,646
Yeah.

684
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:12,325
Tell your guys to help him up. Do it!

685
01:05:12,409 --> 01:05:13,952
Help him up.

686
01:05:15,078 --> 01:05:16,329
No!

687
01:05:17,122 --> 01:05:18,623
I can get up myself.

688
01:05:47,694 --> 01:05:49,112
I can walk on my own.

689
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:03,418
Stay back!

690
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:18,850
I'm telling you two
there's no settling this now!

691
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:33,573
Fly.

692
01:06:35,450 --> 01:06:36,993
This isn't over yet.

693
01:06:37,076 --> 01:06:40,830
Take this and go back home
until it all blows over.

694
01:06:40,914 --> 01:06:42,790
No, I won't.

695
01:06:42,874 --> 01:06:45,752
I swore I'd never return to see my mother
until I made it big.

696
01:06:47,879 --> 01:06:50,798
Okay, I'll take you to Lantau Island then.

697
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:54,719
- Why are you driving me off?
- Why?

698
01:06:56,054 --> 01:06:58,431
I don't want you killed tomorrow
when you step outside.

699
01:06:59,933 --> 01:07:01,142
You know he's a mad dog.

700
01:07:01,226 --> 01:07:03,478
Why didn't you listen to me
and stop pushing him?

701
01:07:03,561 --> 01:07:06,814
He's the one who pushed me.
I didn't do a thing to him!

702
01:07:06,898 --> 01:07:09,484
You don't think I can handle him?

703
01:07:10,818 --> 01:07:12,320
You think you can?

704
01:07:13,238 --> 01:07:15,657
Your head wouldn't be the size of a watermelon
if you could!

705
01:07:19,244 --> 01:07:21,996
Fine!
I got beaten to a pulp!

706
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:24,207
If you think I'm dragging you down,
then just drop me!

707
01:07:29,504 --> 01:07:31,256
Those are your words, not mine.

708
01:07:33,174 --> 01:07:34,634
Don't use them lightly.

709
01:07:36,261 --> 01:07:37,762
If I leave you now,

710
01:07:38,221 --> 01:07:40,848
and you last one day out there,
I'll call you big brother!

711
01:08:24,017 --> 01:08:25,935
None of us knows
what's gonna happen tomorrow.

712
01:08:27,061 --> 01:08:28,396
Right?

713
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:40,533
Let's go eat.

714
01:08:43,703 --> 01:08:45,121
Come on.

715
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:19,364
Get him!

716
01:09:23,117 --> 01:09:25,119
We're gonna kill you!

717
01:09:29,123 --> 01:09:31,250
Did you think I'd never get you?

718
01:09:32,502 --> 01:09:35,505
Leave him alone!
It's not his fault!

719
01:09:35,588 --> 01:09:36,964
Beat me up instead!

720
01:09:37,048 --> 01:09:38,841
Haven't you had enough?

721
01:09:38,925 --> 01:09:41,469
When I'm done with him,
you'll look like twins!

722
01:09:41,552 --> 01:09:44,972
Watch me cripple
your big brother, shithead!

723
01:09:49,602 --> 01:09:51,270
Let's see you fight back now!

724
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:57,235
I'm a fair man.

725
01:09:57,735 --> 01:09:59,862
What you do to me,

726
01:09:59,946 --> 01:10:01,364
I do to you!

727
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:09,622
Better keep still.
Trigger's real sensitive.

728
01:10:10,123 --> 01:10:12,125
No telling what'll get hit, if you move!

729
01:10:19,132 --> 01:10:20,675
What do you know?

730
01:10:21,259 --> 01:10:23,177
You got lucky that time.

731
01:10:23,261 --> 01:10:26,806
Will you be so lucky next time?

732
01:10:30,601 --> 01:10:33,771
Gettin' excited, huh?
Wanna join our little party?

733
01:10:33,855 --> 01:10:35,398
Come join the fun!

734
01:10:38,776 --> 01:10:40,528
Better keep real still.

735
01:10:41,154 --> 01:10:43,531
You might shoot your little brother

736
01:10:43,614 --> 01:10:45,199
or your "little brother".

737
01:10:49,704 --> 01:10:51,372
Fly!

738
01:10:52,123 --> 01:10:55,543
Be strong.

739
01:10:56,919 --> 01:10:59,338
If I don't make it out of here today,

740
01:11:00,047 --> 01:11:01,716
go back home,

741
01:11:02,216 --> 01:11:04,010
and never come back to these streets!

742
01:11:04,093 --> 01:11:05,511
You understand?

743
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:11,267
Tough guy, eh?

744
01:11:11,809 --> 01:11:13,853
We'll see who's tougher,
you or this bat here.

745
01:11:14,979 --> 01:11:18,691
It's real tough too.

746
01:11:18,775 --> 01:11:21,319
Real hard,
isn't it?

747
01:11:41,339 --> 01:11:42,799
Look at you now, asshole!

748
01:11:54,977 --> 01:11:56,813
Another one hits the dirt!

749
01:11:57,563 --> 01:12:00,858
Damn,
you pissed your pants!

750
01:12:00,942 --> 01:12:04,445
Put a diaper on this guy
before you take him out!

751
01:12:04,529 --> 01:12:07,156
What kind of big brother are you?

752
01:12:09,116 --> 01:12:10,868
That's right.

753
01:12:10,952 --> 01:12:15,206
Look at your reflection
in your own piss!

754
01:12:16,249 --> 01:12:18,584
See, what a pathetic failure you are!

755
01:12:20,503 --> 01:12:24,131
Then go back home and be a farmer
with your great big brother.

756
01:12:25,716 --> 01:12:28,511
These city streets aren't for you.

757
01:12:28,594 --> 01:12:29,929
Got it?

758
01:12:53,703 --> 01:12:56,038
It's all right.

759
01:13:03,337 --> 01:13:06,173
Where are you going?

760
01:13:14,682 --> 01:13:16,362
I don't deserve to be your little brother.

761
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:19,520
Just act like you never met me.

762
01:13:21,314 --> 01:13:23,399
From now on, have nothing to do with me.

763
01:13:23,983 --> 01:13:25,985
I'll live or die on my own.

764
01:13:35,286 --> 01:13:36,495
Fly!

765
01:14:34,887 --> 01:14:37,556
Cousin!

766
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:44,438
Open the door!

767
01:14:45,690 --> 01:14:47,066
Open up!

768
01:14:50,111 --> 01:14:52,738
- Hurry and open up.
- What's the matter?

769
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:54,740
My cousin fell and hurt himself.

770
01:15:00,079 --> 01:15:02,081
He's all right. Just let him rest.

771
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:11,298
Where were you last night?

772
01:15:13,467 --> 01:15:14,885
I stayed with my cousin.

773
01:15:23,894 --> 01:15:25,688
Lock the door when you leave.

774
01:15:26,939 --> 01:15:28,858
Call me if anything happens.

775
01:16:31,879 --> 01:16:35,382
You don't get the death penalty
for shooting someone in a police station.

776
01:16:35,466 --> 01:16:38,844
A few years in the can
and you'll have earned your stripes.

777
01:16:38,928 --> 01:16:41,222
Today, people call you a boy,

778
01:16:41,305 --> 01:16:42,932
but tomorrow, they'll call you sir.

779
01:16:43,432 --> 01:16:46,685
It's your chance to make a name
for yourself, understand?

780
01:16:46,769 --> 01:16:48,437
Godfather, I'm afraid.

781
01:16:48,521 --> 01:16:52,525
Afraid? You drew lots
and now you say you're afraid?

782
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:56,195
The other guys will kill you,
even if I let you off.

783
01:16:56,821 --> 01:16:59,698
Enough talk now!
Do it!

784
01:16:59,782 --> 01:17:02,034
Godfather, I'm really afraid.

785
01:17:02,118 --> 01:17:03,702
Chickenshit!

786
01:17:04,912 --> 01:17:06,372
Godfather.

787
01:17:07,873 --> 01:17:09,166
I gotta talk to you.

788
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:12,586
- That's $23.50.
- Here's $30. Keep the change.

789
01:17:16,966 --> 01:17:18,092
Ah-Site.

790
01:17:19,009 --> 01:17:20,344
Brother!

791
01:17:23,013 --> 01:17:25,057
You're a different person
now that you're a father.

792
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:30,938
I have no choice with a wife and baby.

793
01:17:31,021 --> 01:17:33,315
I'll do whatever it takes
to earn a living.

794
01:17:33,399 --> 01:17:34,859
Right.

795
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:38,070
Take this money.
Go on.

796
01:17:38,154 --> 01:17:39,530
Why?

797
01:17:39,613 --> 01:17:41,073
I promised you.

798
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:44,201
Sorry about last time.

799
01:17:45,077 --> 01:17:48,789
Find yourself
a fancy restaurant this time.

800
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,544
And use the rest
to celebrate your son's birth.

801
01:17:55,087 --> 01:17:58,174
Remember: Don't let your wife's family
look down on you.

802
01:17:58,257 --> 01:18:00,217
Stick up for yourself. Understand?

803
01:18:00,301 --> 01:18:03,637
- Where'd you get it?
- That's not your concern!

804
01:18:13,856 --> 01:18:15,357
I'm not always gonna be around.

805
01:18:16,650 --> 01:18:18,277
Call Brother Wah, if you get in trouble.

806
01:18:20,321 --> 01:18:21,822
Brother?

807
01:18:21,906 --> 01:18:24,116
All these years
and we still never amounted to anything.

808
01:18:24,825 --> 01:18:26,619
I've been a pathetic big brother to you.

809
01:18:27,328 --> 01:18:29,163
- Don't say that--
- Let me finish!

810
01:18:37,004 --> 01:18:38,505
I know...

811
01:18:42,635 --> 01:18:46,805
you might have despised me
in the past.

812
01:18:51,185 --> 01:18:53,604
Fine!

813
01:18:54,647 --> 01:18:56,232
I deserved it.

814
01:18:57,650 --> 01:18:59,151
But in a couple days...

815
01:19:03,447 --> 01:19:06,992
when you read the papers and watch TV...

816
01:19:08,577 --> 01:19:12,456
you'll realize I'm not
a gutless coward after all.

817
01:19:16,418 --> 01:19:18,337
That I can be your big brother!

818
01:19:30,557 --> 01:19:33,018
Remember to tell everyone

819
01:19:33,894 --> 01:19:35,562
you've got a great big brother.

820
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:44,280
Don't forget.

821
01:20:08,804 --> 01:20:10,306
Will these clothes do?

822
01:20:12,016 --> 01:20:14,059
You didn't sleep all night. Take a rest.

823
01:20:15,894 --> 01:20:17,313
I can't sleep.

824
01:20:27,489 --> 01:20:28,866
Don't worry.

825
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:31,744
They're minor injuries. It's all right.

826
01:20:32,619 --> 01:20:35,372
You were lucky this time,
but what about next time?

827
01:20:36,999 --> 01:20:39,001
I've never thought about the next time.

828
01:20:40,377 --> 01:20:41,795
There's just one thing.

829
01:20:43,881 --> 01:20:45,591
When I go back to Hong Kong...

830
01:20:47,301 --> 01:20:49,219
I want you to go with me.

831
01:20:51,555 --> 01:20:56,185
Now that I've said it twice,
I can't take it back.

832
01:20:57,061 --> 01:20:58,854
What do you say?

833
01:21:07,946 --> 01:21:09,323
Come on.

834
01:21:12,743 --> 01:21:13,994
Come here.

835
01:21:17,122 --> 01:21:18,499
Stop it!

836
01:21:20,918 --> 01:21:22,503
I'll hit you!

837
01:22:06,588 --> 01:22:09,174
<i>Brother Wah, Fly gave me
a lot of money last night...</i>

838
01:22:10,509 --> 01:22:12,261
and told me to hold another banquet.

839
01:22:12,344 --> 01:22:15,556
He said I'd soon see
he wasn't a coward.

840
01:22:15,639 --> 01:22:17,141
Could you come right away?

841
01:22:18,767 --> 01:22:21,228
If you don't look out for him,
no one will.

842
01:22:31,989 --> 01:22:33,657
I'm on my way.

843
01:22:39,413 --> 01:22:40,539
Leaving again?

844
01:22:41,665 --> 01:22:44,460
It's nothing.
Just a friend who needs to talk.

845
01:22:45,210 --> 01:22:48,714
Oh, and I'll pick up
some medicine too.

846
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:11,820
Anything you want me to get?

847
01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:16,158
I'll be back soon.

848
01:24:41,702 --> 01:24:42,744
Double eight.

849
01:24:42,828 --> 01:24:44,329
<i>Miss Cheung called.</i>

850
01:24:44,413 --> 01:24:45,998
<i>She said forget about the medicine.</i>

851
01:24:46,081 --> 01:24:49,585
<i>Just be careful
and come back as soon as you can.</i>

852
01:25:20,324 --> 01:25:22,034
I win again.

853
01:25:22,117 --> 01:25:23,785
Give me the money.

854
01:25:26,121 --> 01:25:27,539
Another game.

855
01:25:40,677 --> 01:25:43,597
Why didn't you tell me
you changed location, Tony?

856
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:46,433
Get up.

857
01:25:46,516 --> 01:25:49,019
You sure you know the stakes here?

858
01:25:50,937 --> 01:25:52,689
Aren't I welcome here?

859
01:25:55,192 --> 01:25:58,111
Don't go losing
all your blood money to me.

860
01:25:58,987 --> 01:26:00,781
The guilt would drive me crazy.

861
01:26:03,075 --> 01:26:04,368
<i>You?</i>

862
01:26:05,077 --> 01:26:09,122
You're already crazy!
Why feel guilty now, you sorry bastard?

863
01:26:09,206 --> 01:26:10,415
- What are you saying?
- What?

864
01:26:10,499 --> 01:26:11,875
Huh?

865
01:26:11,958 --> 01:26:13,835
Let him be a big man for a few days.

866
01:26:13,919 --> 01:26:17,214
He's risking his life
for the chance.

867
01:26:17,297 --> 01:26:18,715
It's just a couple days.

868
01:26:18,799 --> 01:26:20,008
Right, Brother Fly?

869
01:26:24,513 --> 01:26:26,056
Come on.

870
01:26:26,515 --> 01:26:27,557
Mix up the tiles.

871
01:26:37,526 --> 01:26:38,777
Don't you know the rules?

872
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:40,821
Do it again.

873
01:26:46,118 --> 01:26:47,077
Eight.

874
01:26:55,127 --> 01:26:56,586
Sorry about that.

875
01:26:57,170 --> 01:26:59,256
It just happened.

876
01:26:59,339 --> 01:27:00,966
Come on, let's play.

877
01:27:03,552 --> 01:27:05,345
- Stop messing around!
- Leave him alone!

878
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:08,515
Let him be a two-day hero.

879
01:27:10,642 --> 01:27:12,894
A man of patience, eh?

880
01:27:12,978 --> 01:27:14,438
Well, fuck you!

881
01:27:23,822 --> 01:27:27,534
Think I won't dare
beat the crap out of you?

882
01:27:27,617 --> 01:27:29,077
Go ahead!

883
01:27:29,578 --> 01:27:30,996
Beat the crap out of me!

884
01:27:31,997 --> 01:27:35,333
Put me out of commission,

885
01:27:35,417 --> 01:27:37,544
and you'll have to take care of Big-Mouth Kay!

886
01:27:37,627 --> 01:27:39,379
Come on!

887
01:27:41,506 --> 01:27:42,883
Let me have it!

888
01:27:43,842 --> 01:27:45,093
Goddamn you!

889
01:27:45,635 --> 01:27:47,220
You little shit!

890
01:27:47,304 --> 01:27:49,097
Come on!

891
01:27:49,181 --> 01:27:51,099
One move and I'll blast him!

892
01:27:52,976 --> 01:27:55,187
Shoot me, if you dare!

893
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:57,189
You daring me?

894
01:27:57,606 --> 01:27:59,608
Pull the trigger! Do it!

895
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:06,740
No, don't shoot!

896
01:28:07,908 --> 01:28:10,076
No!

897
01:28:18,502 --> 01:28:20,128
Scared?

898
01:28:20,212 --> 01:28:21,713
Scared to death?

899
01:28:21,797 --> 01:28:23,381
Asshole!

900
01:28:23,465 --> 01:28:25,133
- I'll blow your head off!
- No!

901
01:28:26,468 --> 01:28:27,761
Don't shoot, Big Brother!

902
01:28:28,261 --> 01:28:32,557
I'd like to shoot you,
but you're not even worth the bullet.

903
01:28:35,602 --> 01:28:37,270
Here's the money I owe you.

904
01:28:38,313 --> 01:28:39,731
Pick it up.

905
01:28:41,191 --> 01:28:44,361
Pick it up.
This is your last chance.

906
01:28:44,444 --> 01:28:46,613
Pick it up or I'll shoot!

907
01:28:52,327 --> 01:28:53,703
"Thank you, Big Brother."

908
01:28:56,498 --> 01:28:58,917
Thank you, Big Brother.

909
01:29:03,505 --> 01:29:07,133
You've got your fancy suits and cell phones,
but so what?

910
01:29:08,426 --> 01:29:09,928
Look at your big brother now.

911
01:29:12,764 --> 01:29:13,974
You can go to hell!

912
01:29:26,111 --> 01:29:27,904
We're in this for the money, right?

913
01:29:27,988 --> 01:29:30,782
Why not take what he owes me?

914
01:29:30,866 --> 01:29:32,450
Take it and go dancing.

915
01:29:37,122 --> 01:29:40,375
Is this how you treat
your big brother?

916
01:29:53,597 --> 01:29:57,475
<i>Mom, I'm at the store.
Will you come meet me?</i>

917
01:29:58,018 --> 01:29:59,394
<i>What is it?</i>

918
01:29:59,477 --> 01:30:01,605
<i>Nothing. I know you don't like the heat,</i>

919
01:30:01,688 --> 01:30:03,356
<i>so I bought you an air conditioner.</i>

920
01:30:04,274 --> 01:30:07,569
<i>We've already got AC here.
You keep it.</i>

921
01:30:08,862 --> 01:30:11,406
<i>I can't come meet you. Your father's here.</i>

922
01:30:12,407 --> 01:30:14,743
He's your husband, not my father.

923
01:30:50,695 --> 01:30:52,697
When will you calm down and stop running?

924
01:30:53,198 --> 01:30:55,158
Why did you come out of hiding to see me?

925
01:30:55,909 --> 01:30:57,535
Why don't you leave me alone?

926
01:30:59,287 --> 01:31:02,415
Who's gonna look out for you
if I don't?

927
01:31:09,255 --> 01:31:11,549
Don't think this little stunt's
gonna make you a hotshot!

928
01:31:14,010 --> 01:31:15,178
Sure...

929
01:31:16,346 --> 01:31:19,265
everyone will say you've got guts
when you've done it.

930
01:31:21,184 --> 01:31:23,019
But no one will remember you next week!

931
01:31:24,688 --> 01:31:26,481
What'll become of you then?

932
01:31:26,564 --> 01:31:28,525
No one will even recognize you!

933
01:31:41,121 --> 01:31:43,081
I did a lot of things
for our godfather too.

934
01:31:46,167 --> 01:31:47,585
By the age of 14...

935
01:31:49,004 --> 01:31:50,797
I was already getting paid to kill.

936
01:31:54,342 --> 01:31:56,219
I've got more guts than most guys, right?

937
01:31:56,970 --> 01:31:59,514
But look at me now.
I'm just an ordinary guy!

938
01:32:00,098 --> 01:32:03,643
At least you were a hotshot
for a while!

939
01:32:04,894 --> 01:32:06,187
But what about me?

940
01:32:06,604 --> 01:32:08,106
What about me?

941
01:32:10,734 --> 01:32:13,695
Everyone looks down on me.
Does that make you happy?

942
01:32:14,446 --> 01:32:16,072
People think I'm nothing,

943
01:32:16,656 --> 01:32:19,617
like some stray dog
just following you around!

944
01:32:19,701 --> 01:32:21,077
Did you know that?

945
01:32:24,748 --> 01:32:27,709
I'd rather be a hero for one day,

946
01:32:27,792 --> 01:32:29,586
than go on being a fly all my life!

947
01:32:32,130 --> 01:32:34,549
Let me pull this off on my own, would you?

948
01:32:35,467 --> 01:32:36,885
Just this once!

949
01:32:51,524 --> 01:32:52,859
Okay.

950
01:32:55,528 --> 01:32:57,238
If you've already made up your mind...

951
01:32:58,573 --> 01:33:00,075
I'm going with you.

952
01:33:01,534 --> 01:33:03,179
If they shoot you down,
I'll finish the job.

953
01:33:03,203 --> 01:33:06,081
Stop being so good to me!

954
01:33:10,376 --> 01:33:12,128
I can't pay you back.

955
01:33:13,838 --> 01:33:15,799
Let's not talk about that now.

956
01:33:15,882 --> 01:33:17,967
If you're going, I'm going!

957
01:33:19,761 --> 01:33:23,306
But if you don't, I'll take you
back to Lantau Island with me.

958
01:33:26,935 --> 01:33:28,561
I'll take care of whatever comes up.

959
01:33:36,027 --> 01:33:38,655
Okay, okay.

960
01:33:40,031 --> 01:33:41,449
I'll go back with you.

961
01:33:57,715 --> 01:34:00,718
Hey, why you looking so ragged?

962
01:34:01,219 --> 01:34:03,304
Say hi to my big brother.

963
01:34:04,931 --> 01:34:08,393
Don't be so stingy.
Give the dog some.
