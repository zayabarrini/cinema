00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:37,742
<i>In the year 2046,
a vast rail network spans the globe.</i>

19
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:43,247
<i>A mysterious train leaves for 2046
every once in a while.</i>

00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:48,044
<i>Every passenger going to 2046
has the same intention.</i>

21
00:02:48,753 --> 00:02:50,796
<i>They want to recapture lost memories.</i>

22
00:02:51,881 --> 00:02:55,760
<i>Because nothing ever changes in 2046.</i>

23
00:02:57,178 --> 00:02:59,221
<i>Nobody really knows if that's true,</i>

24
00:02:59,305 --> 00:03:02,350
<i>because nobody's ever come back.</i>

25

<i>Except me.</i>

<i>how long will it take?</i>

30
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:25,956
<i>Some people get away fairly easily.</i>

31
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:30,586
<i>Others find that it takes them
much longer.</i>

32
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:35,174
<i>I forget how long I've been on this train.</i>

33
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:38,386
<i>I'm starting to feel very lonely.</i>

34
00:03:43,766 --> 00:03:47,812
<i>As I recall, many have gone to 2046.</i>

35
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:50,856
<i>You're the first to come back.</i>

36
00:03:52,525 --> 00:03:56,112
May I ask why you left 2046?

37
00:04:02,118 --> 00:04:06,831
<i>Whenever anyone asked why I left 2046,</i>

38
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:09,542
<i>I gave them some vague answer.</i>

39
00:04:12,795 --> 00:04:13,796
<i>Before...</i>

40
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:18,134
<i>when people had secrets
they didn't want to share,</i>

41
00:04:18,217 --> 00:04:19,301
<i>they'd climb a mountain.</i>

42
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:23,347
<i>They'd find a tree
and carve a hole in it...</i>

43
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:28,853
<i>and whisper the secret into the hole...</i>

44
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:32,273
<i>then cover it over with mud.</i>

45
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:40,614
<i>That way,
nobody else would ever discover it.</i>

46
00:04:42,825 --> 00:04:44,660
<i>I once fell in love with someone.</i>

47
00:04:46,704 --> 00:04:48,706
<i>After a while, she wasn't there.</i>

48
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,668
<i>I went to 2046.</i>

49
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:58,048
<i>I thought she might be
waiting for me there.</i>

50
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,927
<i>But I couldn't find her.</i>

51
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:09,268
<i>I can't stop wondering
if she loved me or not.</i>

52
00:05:12,605 --> 00:05:15,065
<i>But I never found out.</i>

53
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:18,903
<i>Maybe her answer was like a secret...</i>

54
00:05:20,905 --> 00:05:24,492
<i>that no one else would ever know.</i>

55
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:30,539
<i>ALL MEMORIES ARE TRACES OF TEARS.</i>

56
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:49,725
Didn't you promise not to come back?

57
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:53,437
I came to see you.

58
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,441
Why?

59
00:05:59,944 --> 00:06:01,904
I have no prospects here

60
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:05,157
so I'll see how things are in Hong Kong.

61
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:12,248
When are you leaving?

62
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,126
The ship sails in two days.

63
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:25,803
Why are you telling me?

64
00:06:35,771 --> 00:06:37,398
I thought we might go together.

65
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:50,995
You know nothing about my past, do you?

66
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:58,168
If you'd rather not tell me, I don't mind.

67
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:15,311
If you win, I'll join you.

68
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,433
<i>She found an indirect way of rejecting me.</i>

69
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:59,355
<i>As I recall, that was the very last time
we saw each other.</i>

70
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,899
<i>Right after that, I left Singapore.</i>

71
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:29,385
<i>I got back to Hong Kong
at the end of 1966.</i>

72
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,679
<i>It was the time of the riots.</i>

73
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:36,308
<i>I wasn't sure how long I'd be staying.</i>

74
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:39,228
<i>So I took a room in a small hotel
in Wan Chai.</i>

75
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:40,729
<i>I wrote columns for the newspapers.</i>

76
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:44,775
<i>They paid ten dollars per thousand words.</i>

77
00:08:45,818 --> 00:08:47,986
<i>It was pretty tough at first.</i>

78
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,878
<i>As long as I could make ends meet,</i>

79
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:08,006
<i>it made no difference
what kind of stuff I wrote.</i>

80
00:09:08,716 --> 00:09:10,092
"Diary of the Bazooka Hero."

81
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:13,429
The new star at Club Luk Kwok is Fei Fei!

82
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:15,931
A knockout beauty with amazing bazookas!

83
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:17,933
A smash hit with tit lovers!

84
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:23,480
Hang on. Of course I'm exaggerating.
I can't say her tits are fake, can I?

85
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:36,034
<i>I soon got used to this kind of life.</i>

86
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:37,745
<i>I became an expert ladies' man.</i>

87
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:40,330
<i>Lots of one-night-stands.</i>

88
00:09:40,956 --> 00:09:44,042
<i>But nothing lasts forever anyway.</i>

89
00:09:59,475 --> 00:10:03,312
<i>DECEMBER 24, 1966</i>

90
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:12,613
Is that really true?

91
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:14,865
Why would I lie to you?

92
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:17,493
You really know me?

93
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:20,871
Weren't you in a show in Singapore in '64?

94
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:22,873
Yes.

95
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,208
You're Lulu.

96
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:38,263
I was then.

97
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:40,307
Not anymore.

98
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:42,476
What's your name now?

99
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:47,523
Why should I tell you?

100
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,568
<i>On Christmas Eve, 1966,</i>

101
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:55,405
<i>I ran into a friend from Singapore
in a nightclub.</i>

102
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:57,282
<i>We'd been rather close.</i>

103
00:10:57,908 --> 00:11:01,411
<i>But that night,
she'd apparently forgotten me.</i>

104
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:07,292
Have we really met before?

105
00:11:09,962 --> 00:11:11,839
How could you forget?

106
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:15,634
You said I looked
like your late boyfriend.

107
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:17,344
You taught me the cha-cha.

108
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:30,190
Go on.

109
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,782
You were always dragging me to the casino.

110
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:43,745
You'd hit a losing streak.
You owed a fortune.

111
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,916
My friends and I
paid for your passage to Hong Kong.

112
00:11:50,586 --> 00:11:52,546
You talked a lot
about your late boyfriend...

113
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:58,427
a Chinese Filipino from a rich family.

114
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:03,557
You planned to marry him,
but he died young.

115
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:07,269
You said he was the love of your life.

116
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:16,153
I shouldn't call up sad memories
at this time of year.

117
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:19,823
But do you remember that Christmas night?

118
00:12:22,034 --> 00:12:23,493
We went drinking.

119
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,216
<i>We talked a lot.</i>

120
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:43,221
<i>Was she just pretending
she'd forgotten me?</i>

121
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:48,185
<i>I took her back to her hotel.
She was dead to the world.</i>

122
00:13:07,496 --> 00:13:08,914
<i>She'd had too much to drink.</i>

123
00:13:09,915 --> 00:13:11,667
<i>So I left quickly.</i>

124
00:13:41,196 --> 00:13:44,658
<i>On my way out,
I noticed a very familiar number.</i>

125
00:13:47,411 --> 00:13:50,205
<i>If I hadn't run into her that night,
I wouldn't have seen that number.</i>

126
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:53,959
<i>And I wouldn't have written 2046.</i>

127
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,722
Can I help you?

128
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:08,598
Is Miss Lulu in?

129
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:12,185
Lulu? There's no Miss Lulu here.

130
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:15,063
There was a Mimi, but she's moved out.

131
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:19,985
But I was here two days ago.
Do you know where she's gone?

132
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:23,905
No! What do you want with her?

133
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:25,532
Nothing really.

134
00:14:26,575 --> 00:14:28,869
I have her key. I wanted to return it.

135
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:31,038
You can give it to me.

136
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:32,873
Thanks.

137
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,421
You want to rent the room?

138
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,590
I'm just back from abroad.

139
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:43,133
I don't have my own place yet.

140
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:45,135
If the room's vacant, I could take a look.

141
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:47,888
This is just a small hotel,

142
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:50,724
but our residents are all decent people.

143
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:52,684
What's your line of work?

144
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:53,977
I write for newspapers.

145
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:57,689
Great! A fellow artist!

146
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:01,485
I haven't always done this.

147
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:04,237
- I used to be an artist too.
- Really?

148
00:15:04,863 --> 00:15:07,574
I took singing lessons in Harbin.

149
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:09,993
Back then, I was a tenor.

150
00:15:10,786 --> 00:15:13,663
It'll be a pleasure to have you here.

151
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:16,208
- When will you move in?
- As soon as possible.

152
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:19,336
But you can't.

153
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:23,340
Room 2046 has to be renovated.
2047 is vacant.

154
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:25,092
Take a look at it.

155
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:33,850
Never mind.

156
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:35,894
I'll come back when it's ready.

157
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:39,064
Why that particular room?

158
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:41,983
Maybe it's the number.

159
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:45,237
It has some significance for you?

160
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,321
I'm joking.

161
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:48,365
Tell you what.

162
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,325
Take a quick look at 2047.

163
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:53,036
If it's okay, you can move in.

164
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,207
Then switch to 2046 when it's ready.

165
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,542
How about it?

166
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:03,130
Can I see the room?

167
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:05,298
Of course! Please.

168
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:24,234
<i>Once I moved in...</i>

169
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:27,088
<i>I found out what had happened
the night before.</i>

170
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:29,781
<i>Lulu was stabbed by a jealous boyfriend...</i>

171
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:33,326
<i>a drummer from the club.</i>

172
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:35,704
<i>She'd really liked him</i>

173
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:38,790
<i>and compared him
with a bird that could never land.</i>

174
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,501
<i>For all these years...</i>

175
00:16:42,586 --> 00:16:45,046
<i>Lulu has been looking
for her legless bird.</i>

176
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,426
<i>Most of her affairs ended badly,
but she didn't mind sad endings.</i>

177
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:52,596
<i>No matter what happened,</i>

178
00:16:53,305 --> 00:16:55,390
<i>at least she was always the leading lady.</i>

179
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:43,897
Good!

180
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:47,067
Sure!

181
00:17:48,443 --> 00:17:49,819
Go!

182
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:53,406
Let's go!

183
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:56,910
Let's go!

184
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:58,119
I'll go with you!

185
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:01,248
Good. I'll go with you!

186
00:18:01,665 --> 00:18:02,707
Sure!

187
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,003
I understand!

188
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:13,009
You know what I mean?
I know. I understand.

189
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:15,428
I sot it!

190
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:20,850
Can I go?

191
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:24,187
I can go!

192
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:26,147
Sure!

193
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:28,858
I understand!

194
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:32,445
Got it!

195
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:40,787
<i>It didn't take long
to finish re-decorating 2046.</i>

196
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,498
<i>But by then, I was used to 2047.</i>

197
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:45,959
Sure!

198
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:48,461
<i>I started hearing a strange voice
through the wall.</i>

199
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:50,714
<i>I thought someone had moved in.</i>

200
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:54,467
<i>But it was the daughter
of the hotel owner, Mr. Wang.</i>

201
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:57,887
Definitely!

202
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,348
I'm definitely going!

203
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:05,687
Okay, let's go!

204
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:26,041
<i>I had no idea what she was saying.</i>

205
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:32,047
<i>The bellhop told me it was Japanese.</i>

206
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:37,052
<i>It seems she had a Japanese boyfriend.</i>

207
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:41,765
Tell the driver 220 Granville Road.

208
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:45,435
- Ga... ran... wai.
- 220 Granville Road.

209
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:47,270
Turn from Humphreys Avenue.

210
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:49,105
- Near Kimberley Road.
- Can you say again?

211
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:51,775
- Don't turn down Salisbury Road.
- Slowly, please.

212
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:52,859
I'll draw you a map.

213
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:54,402
That's my pen!

214
00:19:54,486 --> 00:19:55,820
I'll repeat it once more.

215
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:57,614
Turn from Humphreys Avenue.

216
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,157
Near Kimberley Road.

217
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,618
But don't turn down Salisbury Road.

218
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:02,702
Understand?

219
00:20:03,286 --> 00:20:04,454
I'll draw you a map.

220
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:06,998
Granville Road.

221
00:20:07,082 --> 00:20:09,000
Turn from Humphreys Avenue.

222
00:20:09,084 --> 00:20:10,960
Don't turn down Salisbury Road.

223
00:20:12,587 --> 00:20:14,714
Remember, don't turn down Salisbury Road.

224
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,351
<i>His company in Japan
had sent him to Hong Kong.</i>

225
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:30,605
<i>When he got here,
he checked into this hotel.</i>

226
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:33,942
The world is full of men!

227
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:36,653
Why do you have to choose a Japanese?

228
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:38,363
Get rid of him!

229
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:40,448
I will never meet him!

230
00:20:41,116 --> 00:20:42,909
You want my blessing?

231
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:45,120
Not while I'm alive!

232
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:49,374
<i>It had been going on for ages.</i>

233
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:51,644
<i>Mr. Wang's family suffered
under the Japanese in the war,</i>

234
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:52,919
<i>so they had to break up.</i>

235
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:32,709
Can you tell me what you feel?

236
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:39,757
Do you love me...

237
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:44,387
or not?

238
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:52,020
I'm scared to hear your answer.

239
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:02,739
But I have to ask anyway.

240
00:22:25,762 --> 00:22:26,971
Come away with me.

241
00:23:08,388 --> 00:23:09,389
Goodbye.

242
00:23:28,825 --> 00:23:30,660
<i>The man finally went back to Japan.</i>

243
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:36,958
<i>That's when Miss Wang
began talking to herself.</i>

244
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:07,780
Hey, ask your boss to turn it down a bit!

245
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:11,326
Mr. Chow, you'd better ask him yourself.

246
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:15,955
Mr. Chow.

247
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:17,790
Hasn't he left already?

248
00:24:17,874 --> 00:24:19,459
Why is he back?

249
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:21,461
I will not see him!

250
00:24:21,544 --> 00:24:24,547
If you won't give him up, get out!

251
00:24:24,631 --> 00:24:26,549
Go away with him!

252
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:34,015
<i>I assumed that Mr. Wang played it so loud
because he loved opera.</i>

253
00:24:34,515 --> 00:24:37,977
<i>Actually he didn't want anyone
to overhear the family argument.</i>

254
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:44,293
Come back for me
when you're a little older.

255
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:48,673
I said wait till you grow up.

256
00:25:53,136 --> 00:25:54,137
I like it.

257
00:25:56,222 --> 00:25:59,809
<i>Mr. Wang thought about very little
besides his two daughters.</i>

258
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:02,437
<i>The older one was crazy
about her Japanese man.</i>

259
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,313
<i>The younger one
was precocious for her age.</i>

260
00:26:04,397 --> 00:26:05,998
<i>She kept coming into my room for drinks.</i>

261
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:09,610
<i>Then she ran off with some man,</i>

262
00:26:10,445 --> 00:26:13,030
<i>another drummer from a club band, I heard.</i>

263
00:26:13,948 --> 00:26:16,743
<i>After she left,
her older sister got into trouble too.</i>

264
00:26:16,826 --> 00:26:18,494
Hey, have a word with your boss for me.

265
00:26:18,578 --> 00:26:20,204
I'm a bit late with the rent.

266
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,789
Anyway, he has my deposit.

267
00:26:22,707 --> 00:26:24,751
Mr. Chow, tell him yourself.

268
00:26:24,834 --> 00:26:26,669
He's in a foul mood these days.

269
00:26:26,753 --> 00:26:28,463
What's eating him?

270
00:26:28,546 --> 00:26:30,256
First, one daughter ran away.

271
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:31,780
Now the other one's in the hospital.

272
00:26:31,841 --> 00:26:34,469
- That's why he's so angry.
- Why is she in the hospital?

273
00:26:34,552 --> 00:26:37,388
He wouldn't say. He was quite strange.

274
00:26:37,472 --> 00:26:38,973
Steer clear of him.

275
00:26:39,056 --> 00:26:40,224
So, that's it?

276
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:44,061
Anyhow, give him my invitation.
It's my father's birthday banquet.

277
00:26:44,145 --> 00:26:46,647
He can deduct his gift
from the rent I owe.

278
00:26:48,566 --> 00:26:52,612
<i>On May 22, 1967,
they imposed a curfew in Hong Kong.</i>

279
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:54,697
<i>Homemade bombs caused panic.</i>

280
00:26:55,323 --> 00:26:57,658
<i>The economy stopped dead.</i>

281
00:26:59,202 --> 00:27:00,703
<i>I stopped going out.</i>

282
00:27:01,704 --> 00:27:03,414
<i>Some thought I was a reformed character.</i>

283
00:27:03,831 --> 00:27:05,500
<i>Actually, I was writing —</i>

284
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:08,002
<i>a story called 2046...</i>

285
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:10,755
<i>all about men and women looking for love,</i>

286
00:27:10,838 --> 00:27:13,424
<i>risking everything
to get to a place called 2046.</i>

287
00:27:13,508 --> 00:27:14,717
What's that?

288
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:19,388
Let's go to 2046.

289
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:23,067
<i>I made it as bizarre and erotic
as possible without crossing the line.</i>

290
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,353
<i>The readers liked it.</i>

291
00:27:26,646 --> 00:27:29,982
<i>Some didn't take
to the science fiction angle.</i>

292
00:27:30,525 --> 00:27:34,153
<i>But all 2046 meant to me
was the number of a hotel room.</i>

293
00:27:37,657 --> 00:27:39,575
<i>I made up the whole thing,</i>

294
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:42,495
<i>but some of my own experiences
found their way into it.</i>

295
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:08,224
<i>People I ran into
in the normal course of things</i>

296
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:09,433
<i>turned up in my stories.</i>

297
00:30:10,393 --> 00:30:12,436
<i>I felt more and more at ease
in my fictional World.</i>

298
00:30:23,572 --> 00:30:26,534
<i>Around that time,
Mr. Wang's music got loud again.</i>

299
00:30:27,785 --> 00:30:29,226
<i>More trouble with his two daughters.</i>

300
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,998
<i>But also, because of the bad state
of the economy,</i>

301
00:30:32,081 --> 00:30:33,582
<i>a lot of the rooms were empty.</i>

302
00:30:34,792 --> 00:30:37,503
<i>Then in September, the rioting ended.</i>

303
00:30:38,087 --> 00:30:39,880
<i>Life went back to normal.</i>

304
00:30:46,262 --> 00:30:49,640
<i>Soon someone moved into 2046.</i>

305
00:30:57,648 --> 00:30:59,025
Have you nearly finished?

306
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:01,610
It's too early in the day for that!

307
00:31:01,694 --> 00:31:03,863
Some of us are trying to sleep!

308
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:01,545
Peeking?

309
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,424
The woman next door is quite a dish!
What are my chances?

310
00:32:05,508 --> 00:32:06,967
You're out of your head.

311
00:32:07,051 --> 00:32:09,512
A father-to-be
shouldn't have that on his mind.

312
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:12,306
Now that she's pregnant,
my wife won't let me touch her.

313
00:32:12,389 --> 00:32:14,183
Put in a good word for me.

314
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:18,312
Come on.

315
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:19,897
Okay.

316
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,398
How much?

317
00:32:22,108 --> 00:32:23,359
How much have you got?

318
00:32:25,194 --> 00:32:26,195
$100.

319
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:27,571
Wait for my call.

320
00:32:27,655 --> 00:32:30,366
Mr. Chow! Mr. Chow!

321
00:32:31,534 --> 00:32:32,910
Mr. Chow, a call for you!

322
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:34,912
Bright and early, huh?

323
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:37,206
She's not up yet.

324
00:32:39,041 --> 00:32:40,459
Why come over?

325
00:32:40,543 --> 00:32:42,211
I told you. It has to be arranged.

326
00:32:43,129 --> 00:32:45,923
She's not some streetwalker.

327
00:32:47,091 --> 00:32:48,926
A fellow artist like you.

328
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:50,761
Show her a little respect, will you?

329
00:32:52,012 --> 00:32:54,306
Yes, I'll tell you right away.

330
00:32:56,225 --> 00:32:58,060
Miss Bai, your key.

331
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,646
You're back, Miss Bai.

332
00:33:11,365 --> 00:33:12,366
Who is it?

333
00:33:14,368 --> 00:33:17,538
- Who are you looking for?
- Mr. Chow suggested I come by.

334
00:33:18,956 --> 00:33:20,166
You're back, Mr. Chow.

335
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:22,501
Did you win on the dogs?

336
00:33:22,585 --> 00:33:25,212
- I lost!
- I won a little.

337
00:33:35,139 --> 00:33:36,140
Hey.

338
00:33:46,984 --> 00:33:48,319
Looking for me?

339
00:33:52,948 --> 00:33:54,950
I think you know this person.

340
00:33:56,702 --> 00:33:58,162
What are doing in that room?

341
00:33:58,245 --> 00:34:01,248
You said you'd arrange it! I paid you!

342
00:34:01,332 --> 00:34:02,750
When did I say it was this room?

343
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:05,211
- I said that room.
- I said this one.

344
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:07,129
Your girl's in that room.

345
00:34:07,213 --> 00:34:08,964
How embarrassing! Please excuse him.

346
00:34:09,048 --> 00:34:11,175
I told you the room on the left!

347
00:34:11,258 --> 00:34:13,594
- I said I wanted that one!
- Shut up!

348
00:34:15,471 --> 00:34:16,472
Who is it?

349
00:34:22,436 --> 00:34:24,313
Oh, you again.

350
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:27,399
I just wanted to apologize for last night.

351
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,068
Forget it.

352
00:34:29,151 --> 00:34:30,194
Go away.

353
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:39,703
Ping, my editor, was out of line.

354
00:34:39,787 --> 00:34:41,622
But he's not really so bad.

355
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:44,833
Just a bit stingy. Never pays his way.

356
00:34:45,501 --> 00:34:47,711
Always says he's broke
when the check arrives.

357
00:34:47,795 --> 00:34:49,588
So I thought I'd play a trick on him.

358
00:34:51,215 --> 00:34:54,843
At my expense? Didn't you go a bit far?

359
00:34:56,762 --> 00:34:58,722
He only fell for it
because you're so beautiful.

360
00:34:58,806 --> 00:35:01,767
You're quite a flirt.

361
00:35:03,185 --> 00:35:04,853
Just stating a fact.

362
00:35:06,272 --> 00:35:07,856
A small token of apology.

363
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,278
Please accept it.

364
00:35:12,945 --> 00:35:14,071
I don't want it.

365
00:35:14,822 --> 00:35:18,117
You're still cross, aren't you?

366
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,452
- Please accept it.
- No.

367
00:35:20,536 --> 00:35:21,745
- Come on.
- No.

368
00:35:21,829 --> 00:35:23,330
It's just a small token. Accept it.

369
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,253
Don't make fun of me. I mean what I say.

370
00:35:29,336 --> 00:35:30,337
Now get out.

371
00:35:34,967 --> 00:35:37,511
That's good. Let it all out.

372
00:35:38,595 --> 00:35:41,056
How can I make you feel better?
Slap me again.

373
00:35:41,849 --> 00:35:42,975
Think I wouldn't dare?

374
00:35:44,018 --> 00:35:45,227
Come closer.

375
00:35:50,858 --> 00:35:51,859
Bastard.

376
00:36:00,826 --> 00:36:02,411
Don't be so petty.

377
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:03,954
That's enough.

378
00:36:04,872 --> 00:36:08,083
I'm gracious enough
not to slap you again.

379
00:36:08,167 --> 00:36:10,127
That doesn't mean you can take advantage.

380
00:36:12,129 --> 00:36:15,090
This time, I'll let you save face.

381
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:19,386
If there's ever a next time,
I'll be less polite.

382
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:21,555
It won't happen again.

383
00:36:21,638 --> 00:36:24,099
My face is still numb.

384
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:26,685
- Accept it.
- No.

385
00:36:28,479 --> 00:36:30,230
They're just a token of my regard.

386
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:32,816
I chose them myself.

387
00:36:34,068 --> 00:36:35,819
See if you like them.

388
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:38,364
If you don't, just throw them away.

389
00:36:40,991 --> 00:36:41,992
There.

390
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,750
Good.

391
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,926
I'll leave now.

392
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:19,696
Calm down.

393
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:25,411
It's none of your business
who I dated last night.

394
00:37:28,205 --> 00:37:29,248
Who?

395
00:37:31,208 --> 00:37:32,459
Dabao.

396
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:36,588
Which Dabao?

397
00:37:37,214 --> 00:37:39,883
The fat one or the skinny one?

398
00:37:39,967 --> 00:37:42,094
From Shanghai or from Shandong?

399
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:46,723
The trouble is,
I know so many men named Dabao.

400
00:37:46,807 --> 00:37:49,518
How should I know which one you mean?

401
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:53,397
Yes, I did.

402
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,357
What are you going to do about it?

403
00:37:58,026 --> 00:37:59,027
Fine.

404
00:37:59,445 --> 00:38:01,196
I'll be waiting.

405
00:38:05,701 --> 00:38:06,952
Let me just say.

406
00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:09,580
Get out!

407
00:38:10,414 --> 00:38:12,708
You think I'll stand for this?

408
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:14,918
It's either her or me.

409
00:38:15,002 --> 00:38:16,545
You'd better choose.

410
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:17,629
Now get out!

411
00:38:53,624 --> 00:38:57,461
<i>DECEMBER 24, 1967</i>

412
00:39:25,948 --> 00:39:27,533
You're back early.

413
00:39:27,616 --> 00:39:28,951
It's Christmas.

414
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:31,245
Shouldn't you be having dinner
with your boyfriend?

415
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:33,205
What boyfriend?

416
00:39:37,334 --> 00:39:38,835
Then let's have supper.

417
00:39:39,545 --> 00:39:40,546
Come on.

418
00:39:41,463 --> 00:39:45,217
You have so many girlfriends.
You need company?

419
00:39:45,926 --> 00:39:47,094
Go out with them.

420
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:51,890
They all want to be with me,
but I can't choose.

421
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:54,351
The fairest thing is to see none of them.

422
00:39:55,477 --> 00:39:58,897
Come on. No point
in staying cooped up in your room.

423
00:39:58,981 --> 00:40:00,732
I'm not in a good mood tonight.

424
00:40:02,234 --> 00:40:06,446
I might get drunk and slap you again.

425
00:40:08,865 --> 00:40:10,367
That's okay.

426
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:11,994
I'm used to it.

427
00:40:12,828 --> 00:40:16,039
If slapping me makes you happy,
take that as my Christmas present.

428
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:20,711
Come on.

429
00:40:21,378 --> 00:40:22,504
Come with me.

430
00:40:23,255 --> 00:40:24,756
Let go of me.

431
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:52,034
I didn't expect
to spend Christmas like this.

432
00:40:53,702 --> 00:40:54,911
What were you expecting?

433
00:40:58,165 --> 00:40:59,708
We'd made plans.

434
00:41:01,043 --> 00:41:02,711
He was taking me to Singapore.

435
00:41:04,838 --> 00:41:07,174
He says it's warm there at Christmas.

436
00:41:13,513 --> 00:41:16,099
So I didn't even pack winter clothes.

437
00:41:17,893 --> 00:41:22,064
What I'm wearing now is for summer.

438
00:41:30,364 --> 00:41:31,657
Have you been to Singapore?

439
00:41:34,701 --> 00:41:36,203
I worked there for several years.

440
00:41:40,957 --> 00:41:41,958
What kind of work?

441
00:41:43,085 --> 00:41:44,336
On a newspaper.

442
00:41:47,589 --> 00:41:48,965
Is it fun there?

443
00:41:50,676 --> 00:41:51,843
It's okay.

444
00:41:56,765 --> 00:41:58,475
Tell me more.

445
00:41:59,893 --> 00:42:01,395
I won't be going.

446
00:42:02,604 --> 00:42:04,439
So I'll just have to imagine it.

447
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:11,738
What do you want to know?

448
00:42:18,704 --> 00:42:20,122
How's the climate?

449
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:25,919
Pretty warm...

450
00:42:26,962 --> 00:42:28,380
all year round.

451
00:42:29,631 --> 00:42:32,050
Sometimes you can't
tell what season it is.

452
00:42:35,095 --> 00:42:36,596
The food stalls are great.

453
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:39,808
Ping and I ate there after work.

454
00:42:41,226 --> 00:42:43,395
We'd eat and drink till dawn.

455
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:51,611
Our landlord was a funny man.

456
00:42:52,404 --> 00:42:54,698
Short and fat, and he always wore a skirt.

457
00:42:56,116 --> 00:42:58,785
What the Malays call a sarong.

458
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,749
But when you're away from home...

459
00:43:05,459 --> 00:43:06,793
it sometimes gets boring.

460
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:20,056
That was a dull meal.

461
00:43:20,974 --> 00:43:22,476
Another drink somewhere else?

462
00:43:24,144 --> 00:43:25,729
You really like to drink.

463
00:43:27,063 --> 00:43:28,857
It makes things easy.

464
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:31,276
When I'm drunk, I have no worries.

465
00:43:33,153 --> 00:43:37,532
Won't your girlfriends
be missing you tonight?

466
00:43:37,991 --> 00:43:41,411
They're not stuck to me.
They see other men too.

467
00:43:42,037 --> 00:43:44,331
We just have fun together.

468
00:43:44,414 --> 00:43:46,166
They still need to make a living.

469
00:43:48,335 --> 00:43:49,836
I don't get it.

470
00:43:50,504 --> 00:43:52,881
Where does all that fun get you?

471
00:43:53,507 --> 00:43:57,052
If you find the right person,
why waste time on anyone else?

472
00:43:57,344 --> 00:43:58,887
If I find the right person.

473
00:43:59,721 --> 00:44:02,682
A man like me has nothing much
except free time.

474
00:44:03,517 --> 00:44:05,602
That's why I need company.

475
00:44:07,062 --> 00:44:09,189
So people are just time killers to you?

476
00:44:09,272 --> 00:44:10,774
I wouldn't say that.

477
00:44:12,025 --> 00:44:13,985
Other people can borrow my time too.

478
00:44:16,738 --> 00:44:18,657
And this evening?

479
00:44:19,115 --> 00:44:21,493
Are you borrowing me,
or am I borrowing you?

480
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:23,036
No difference.

481
00:44:23,745 --> 00:44:27,457
Maybe I borrowed you earlier
and now you're borrowing me.

482
00:44:27,916 --> 00:44:28,917
Ridiculous.

483
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:35,298
Don't get me wrong.

484
00:44:36,842 --> 00:44:39,135
I don't intend to take advantage of you.

485
00:44:40,554 --> 00:44:43,348
If that was what I wanted,
I had plenty of options.

486
00:44:44,558 --> 00:44:46,309
I just want us to be drinking pals.

487
00:44:48,353 --> 00:44:49,855
Is that okay?

488
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:55,151
It's hard. But I'll give it a try.

489
00:44:58,363 --> 00:44:59,364
Okay.

490
00:45:00,782 --> 00:45:02,200
Let's try.

491
00:45:06,621 --> 00:45:08,456
- Where to?
- Let's drink.

492
00:46:39,214 --> 00:46:41,967
Mr. Chow, you seem happy tonight.

493
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:44,803
I certainly am.
My friends are buying me dinner.

494
00:46:45,095 --> 00:46:46,304
This way, please.

495
00:46:49,432 --> 00:46:51,601
Ping. Is it someone's birthday?

496
00:46:51,685 --> 00:46:55,355
Better than that.
Chow has a new girlfriend.

497
00:46:56,106 --> 00:46:57,774
Definitely worth celebrating.

498
00:46:57,857 --> 00:46:59,776
Mr. Chow, what would you like
to eat tonight?

499
00:46:59,859 --> 00:47:02,278
Something expensive.

500
00:47:03,071 --> 00:47:05,240
- Snake?
- Yes, snake would be good.

501
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:06,804
Snake isn't cheap. Can you afford it?

502
00:47:06,866 --> 00:47:08,326
Sure you'll win the bet?

503
00:47:08,410 --> 00:47:10,495
Shut up. Don't mind him.

504
00:47:10,578 --> 00:47:12,956
- What'll it be, Mr. Chow?
- Snake.

505
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:14,499
And a lamb casserole too.

506
00:47:15,291 --> 00:47:16,376
And bring Hoi's whiskey.

507
00:47:16,459 --> 00:47:17,544
Yes. Good.

508
00:47:34,102 --> 00:47:36,980
Can't let this go to waste.
It's delicious.

509
00:47:37,063 --> 00:47:38,982
Where's your girl, Chow?

510
00:47:39,065 --> 00:47:41,443
It's already 2:00 a.m. Is she coming?

511
00:47:41,526 --> 00:47:45,030
She can't be coming.

512
00:47:45,113 --> 00:47:47,198
I don't think she's coming.

513
00:47:47,282 --> 00:47:48,783
It's all your fault.

514
00:47:48,867 --> 00:47:50,302
It's because of you that this happened.

515
00:47:50,326 --> 00:47:51,453
Why blame me?

516
00:47:51,536 --> 00:47:53,413
You brought this on yourself.

517
00:47:53,496 --> 00:47:56,416
You said she was gentle and obedient.

518
00:47:56,499 --> 00:47:58,043
Now we know the truth.

519
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:03,214
I said she was sometimes obedient
and sometimes gentle.

520
00:48:04,007 --> 00:48:06,885
But she's full of surprises.
That's part of the fun.

521
00:48:06,968 --> 00:48:10,597
- So, what next?
- Yes, what now?

522
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,557
Whatever you feel like doing.

523
00:48:17,395 --> 00:48:18,813
And then what happened?

524
00:48:19,939 --> 00:48:21,441
Tell me.

525
00:48:26,696 --> 00:48:28,490
How are you going to thank me?

526
00:48:33,411 --> 00:48:35,455
Pervert.

527
00:48:43,379 --> 00:48:44,964
Open up.

528
00:48:45,048 --> 00:48:47,383
- Who is it?
- Open the door.

529
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:51,679
It's late.

530
00:48:53,014 --> 00:48:55,100
You played a fine joke on me tonight.

531
00:48:55,892 --> 00:48:57,852
I finished work late,

532
00:48:57,936 --> 00:49:00,647
too late to get there.

533
00:49:01,106 --> 00:49:02,732
So I didn't come.

534
00:49:06,111 --> 00:49:07,237
Where is your mustache?

535
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:10,115
That's your fault too.

536
00:49:11,449 --> 00:49:13,535
How could I know you'd stand me up?

537
00:49:14,619 --> 00:49:17,831
I thought I'd win a few hundred.

538
00:49:17,914 --> 00:49:19,457
Instead I lost my mustache.

539
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:21,584
This is all your fault.

540
00:49:23,169 --> 00:49:25,421
You deserved it.

541
00:49:26,172 --> 00:49:27,841
Who pushed you into the bet?

542
00:49:29,926 --> 00:49:31,594
I'll tell you something.

543
00:49:31,678 --> 00:49:33,680
Ping asked me not to show up.

544
00:49:35,056 --> 00:49:38,434
Anyhow,
I wasn't that fond of the mustache.

545
00:49:40,770 --> 00:49:42,605
You look younger now.

546
00:49:44,023 --> 00:49:45,316
Don't you like it?

547
00:49:47,152 --> 00:49:48,945
You're making fun of me.

548
00:49:49,946 --> 00:49:51,489
You tricked me.

549
00:49:55,368 --> 00:49:57,620
I'll get you for this.

550
00:50:00,206 --> 00:50:01,875
How will you make it up to me?

551
00:50:01,958 --> 00:50:03,501
At least give me a kiss.

552
00:50:05,545 --> 00:50:07,630
You bit me.

553
00:50:08,298 --> 00:50:10,008
Come and get me.

554
00:50:12,093 --> 00:50:14,470
You're in for it when I catch you.

555
00:50:17,849 --> 00:50:18,933
Don't touch me there.

556
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:41,414
Bastard. You've bruised me.

557
00:50:41,915 --> 00:50:43,875
Think you were any better?

558
00:50:44,334 --> 00:50:46,377
Look, I'm bleeding.

559
00:50:47,629 --> 00:50:49,714
Maybe it's because winter's coming.

560
00:50:49,797 --> 00:50:54,135
See what happens when I eat lamb?

561
00:50:56,387 --> 00:50:58,640
Brings out the beast in me.

562
00:51:02,101 --> 00:51:03,978
- What?
- Don't move.

563
00:51:06,231 --> 00:51:07,398
What are you doing?

564
00:51:07,482 --> 00:51:10,235
- Shaving you.
- Don't.

565
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:13,571
Who knows where that razor's been?

566
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:15,823
It could bring me bad luck.

567
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:24,624
Let's go for round two.

568
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:26,668
No way.

569
00:51:52,193 --> 00:51:53,736
Why are you dressed?

570
00:51:58,074 --> 00:51:59,867
I'm going back to my room.

571
00:51:59,951 --> 00:52:01,286
I'm exhausted.

572
00:52:06,541 --> 00:52:08,459
This is all I have

573
00:52:09,252 --> 00:52:11,629
aside from loose change for the bus.

574
00:52:11,713 --> 00:52:14,215
Here's $200.

575
00:52:15,675 --> 00:52:17,051
Please take it.

576
00:52:17,135 --> 00:52:18,303
I don't want it.

577
00:52:19,345 --> 00:52:20,930
I wasn't selling.

578
00:52:21,472 --> 00:52:23,266
That's not how I meant it.

579
00:52:23,808 --> 00:52:27,228
I want to pay for your torn dress.

580
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:29,022
Please take it.

581
00:52:32,358 --> 00:52:33,526
I see.

582
00:52:34,777 --> 00:52:37,155
You're afraid I'll cling to you.
Is that it?

583
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:43,661
Fine.

584
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:45,496
I'll take ten dollars.

585
00:52:46,497 --> 00:52:48,499
Think of it as a discount rate.

586
00:52:52,211 --> 00:52:54,630
If you ever want to come over again,

587
00:52:54,714 --> 00:52:55,965
I'll charge the same.

588
00:55:33,706 --> 00:55:35,082
I'm going back to my room.

589
00:56:03,945 --> 00:56:05,279
Come here.

590
00:56:35,977 --> 00:56:37,144
Not tonight.

591
00:56:38,312 --> 00:56:39,313
Why not?

592
00:56:40,731 --> 00:56:42,942
Not in the mood?

593
00:56:44,443 --> 00:56:46,862
Can't take the strain tonight.

594
00:56:48,614 --> 00:56:51,534
Anyhow, I'm a bit short of cash.

595
00:56:51,993 --> 00:56:56,163
Never mind. You can owe me.

596
00:56:58,749 --> 00:57:02,211
I don't like being in debt.

597
00:57:23,649 --> 00:57:25,359
The reception's at 6:00.
Dinner's at 8:00.

598
00:57:25,443 --> 00:57:28,112
I don't mind if you can't make it.
Just send your gift.

599
00:57:28,821 --> 00:57:30,114
No more than you do.

600
00:57:30,197 --> 00:57:31,616
You hold banquets all year round.

601
00:57:31,699 --> 00:57:34,243
I've had four birthday invitations
from you this year.

602
00:57:34,327 --> 00:57:36,579
I'll send over
some more invitation cards later.

603
00:57:36,662 --> 00:57:37,830
Think of people with money.

604
00:57:37,913 --> 00:57:39,874
Write in their names
and send them invitations.

605
00:57:39,957 --> 00:57:41,375
Okay, that's settled.

606
00:57:41,459 --> 00:57:43,711
Mr. Chow, holding another banquet?

607
00:57:43,794 --> 00:57:46,547
You know that we have birthdays
in different calendars.

608
00:57:46,631 --> 00:57:48,215
Another of mine has come around.

609
00:57:48,299 --> 00:57:49,467
No doubt.

610
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:52,845
- Here's one for your boss.
- All right.

611
00:57:52,928 --> 00:57:54,472
Tell him that, since we're so close,

612
00:57:54,555 --> 00:57:57,516
he can deduct his gift
from the rent I owe.

613
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,977
- Make sure he gets it.
- Okay.

614
00:58:04,482 --> 00:58:05,983
It's late. What's so urgent?

615
00:58:06,067 --> 00:58:07,777
I just got back from Macau.

616
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:10,196
Chow asked me to bring you a present.

617
00:58:12,198 --> 00:58:13,532
You two went to Macau?

618
00:58:13,616 --> 00:58:17,453
Yes, we had some days off.
So we went to the casino.

619
00:58:24,126 --> 00:58:25,211
Oh, it's beautiful.

620
00:58:26,253 --> 00:58:30,758
He says he found some money in his pocket.

621
00:58:30,841 --> 00:58:33,886
So before losing it all at the tables,

622
00:58:34,428 --> 00:58:35,846
he bought you a present.

623
00:58:37,723 --> 00:58:38,724
Where is he?

624
00:58:38,808 --> 00:58:42,395
Not back yet. You know what he's like.

625
00:58:42,478 --> 00:58:46,023
Extravagant at the start of the month
and broke well before the end.

626
00:58:46,107 --> 00:58:48,734
He made several thousand
hosting that party.

627
00:58:48,818 --> 00:58:50,653
So now he's really enjoying himself.

628
00:58:51,278 --> 00:58:52,571
Is he there alone?

629
00:58:52,655 --> 00:58:55,116
Of course not. There's a gang of them.

630
00:58:55,199 --> 00:58:57,284
He likes company.

631
00:58:58,661 --> 00:58:59,954
Was he always like this?

632
00:59:00,037 --> 00:59:02,248
Let's not talk about him.
Let's have a drink.

633
00:59:07,586 --> 00:59:10,089
But I should warn you.

634
00:59:10,172 --> 00:59:12,049
I know you like Chow a lot.

635
00:59:12,133 --> 00:59:14,593
Don't waste your time on him.

636
00:59:14,677 --> 00:59:16,262
He's not serious.

637
00:59:36,115 --> 00:59:37,616
Guess who.

638
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:40,786
There's only one possibility.

639
00:59:41,704 --> 00:59:43,080
Let me have a bite first.

640
00:59:51,672 --> 00:59:52,965
What are you doing here?

641
00:59:56,469 --> 00:59:57,970
What am I doing here?

642
00:59:59,263 --> 01:00:01,056
What do you think?

643
01:00:32,087 --> 01:00:34,465
I thought I was pretty wild,

644
01:00:35,049 --> 01:00:36,634
but you're much wilder.

645
01:00:38,469 --> 01:00:39,512
Pay up.

646
01:00:40,930 --> 01:00:43,307
I haven't seen you for ages.

647
01:00:44,433 --> 01:00:46,727
I've been busy.

648
01:00:46,811 --> 01:00:48,395
Liar.

649
01:00:49,021 --> 01:00:50,856
Tell me the truth.

650
01:00:52,358 --> 01:00:53,818
I am.

651
01:00:57,613 --> 01:00:59,782
Who was that woman the other day?

652
01:01:01,951 --> 01:01:03,244
What woman?

653
01:01:04,245 --> 01:01:05,538
Don't pretend.

654
01:01:07,790 --> 01:01:10,543
I saw her leaving your room.

655
01:01:11,544 --> 01:01:12,920
Who is she?

656
01:01:14,088 --> 01:01:16,715
- A friend.
- A friend?

657
01:01:19,844 --> 01:01:21,929
What was she doing in your room?

658
01:01:23,264 --> 01:01:25,266
Don't be nosy, all right?

659
01:01:25,724 --> 01:01:27,142
Go back to your room.

660
01:01:27,601 --> 01:01:29,019
I have work to do.

661
01:01:33,649 --> 01:01:34,900
I won't.

662
01:01:37,027 --> 01:01:38,988
I'm sleeping here tonight.

663
01:01:40,114 --> 01:01:41,657
An overnight stay is expensive.

664
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:43,367
No problem.

665
01:01:43,450 --> 01:01:45,494
Name your price.

666
01:01:46,453 --> 01:01:50,165
I'd pay anything to be with you,
every day.

667
01:01:51,709 --> 01:01:53,210
Retail is fine.

668
01:01:53,669 --> 01:01:55,129
Wholesale is out of the question.

669
01:01:55,212 --> 01:01:56,380
Why?

670
01:01:57,214 --> 01:01:58,591
I just don't like it.

671
01:02:01,135 --> 01:02:03,137
Could you make an exception for me?

672
01:02:03,679 --> 01:02:04,763
No.

673
01:02:07,850 --> 01:02:09,894
You treat all women like this?

674
01:02:11,353 --> 01:02:12,521
Except one.

675
01:02:13,022 --> 01:02:14,982
- Who?
- My mother.

676
01:02:15,065 --> 01:02:16,942
I'm serious.

677
01:02:20,738 --> 01:02:22,907
I don't mind you having other women.

678
01:02:23,949 --> 01:02:26,243
But I won't be treated the same as them.

679
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:33,542
I don't care if you love me or not.

680
01:02:34,668 --> 01:02:36,462
I'll love you anyway.

681
01:02:39,757 --> 01:02:43,218
Since we got together,
I haven't brought other men back.

682
01:02:44,261 --> 01:02:46,764
I hoped you'd think the same way.

683
01:02:48,933 --> 01:02:50,267
Will you promise me that?

684
01:02:50,351 --> 01:02:51,560
No.

685
01:03:04,782 --> 01:03:06,033
I see.

686
01:03:08,077 --> 01:03:09,703
Then we're through.

687
01:03:15,459 --> 01:03:17,044
I'll never bother you.

688
01:03:17,586 --> 01:03:19,838
And I don't ever want you
in my room again.

689
01:03:24,301 --> 01:03:25,844
Here. Ten dollars.

690
01:03:26,679 --> 01:03:27,972
Tonight, I'm paying.

691
01:03:33,936 --> 01:03:35,104
Thank you.

692
01:03:36,605 --> 01:03:39,441
If you're ever in the mood,
feel free to come over.

693
01:03:40,442 --> 01:03:42,069
I'll charge you the same.

694
01:03:58,877 --> 01:04:00,462
Having fun?

695
01:04:01,714 --> 01:04:03,173
What do you care?

696
01:04:32,369 --> 01:04:34,038
You were rather loud last night.

697
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:36,540
I meant to be.

698
01:04:37,583 --> 01:04:40,461
You bring back women.
Why shouldn't I have men?

699
01:04:41,628 --> 01:04:43,881
I want to see if you really don't mind.

700
01:05:03,150 --> 01:05:06,570
I won't go.
Why don't you come here instead?

701
01:05:14,161 --> 01:05:15,537
Forget it. Don't come!

702
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:39,788
<i>After Bai Ling moved out,
she started dating Dabao.</i>

703
01:06:40,372 --> 01:06:42,124
<i>And I saw other women too.</i>

704
01:06:42,583 --> 01:06:45,252
<i>If our paths ever crossed,
we'd pretend not to see each other.</i>

705
01:06:45,335 --> 01:06:47,129
<i>Rather pathetic, I know.</i>

706
01:06:47,212 --> 01:06:49,715
<i>But it was better for us
to end it this way.</i>

707
01:06:49,798 --> 01:06:51,884
<i>I've never seen her since.</i>

708
01:06:51,967 --> 01:06:53,427
<i>But sometimes...</i>

709
01:06:54,344 --> 01:06:56,263
<i>she pops up in my stories.</i>

710
01:07:05,731 --> 01:07:07,900
Your change. Please check it.

711
01:07:08,483 --> 01:07:09,484
Thank you.

712
01:07:10,694 --> 01:07:11,987
Are you going out later?

713
01:07:12,946 --> 01:07:13,947
Why?

714
01:07:15,657 --> 01:07:18,243
Could you mail this letter for me?

715
01:07:24,625 --> 01:07:25,626
Sure.

716
01:07:27,502 --> 01:07:29,254
<i>Then Miss Wang came back.</i>

717
01:07:29,338 --> 01:07:32,341
<i>I knew it from the familiar sound
coming through the wall.</i>

718
01:07:34,676 --> 01:07:36,136
Please take me with you.

719
01:07:37,804 --> 01:07:38,805
Good.

720
01:07:40,224 --> 01:07:41,433
What are you doing?

721
01:07:41,516 --> 01:07:43,393
Wasn't I clear?

722
01:07:43,477 --> 01:07:45,437
Don't contact that Japanese man.

723
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:47,856
Why are you writing to him in secret?

724
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:49,399
Aren't you ashamed?

725
01:07:50,150 --> 01:07:51,818
Return his letter.

726
01:07:53,737 --> 01:07:54,821
No?

727
01:08:20,681 --> 01:08:22,057
What are you reading?

728
01:08:23,225 --> 01:08:24,434
A martial-arts novel.

729
01:08:25,143 --> 01:08:26,561
You like them?

730
01:08:35,612 --> 01:08:37,698
If your friend wants
to send you more letters

731
01:08:37,781 --> 01:08:39,992
and you don't want your dad to know,

732
01:08:40,075 --> 01:08:41,994
tell him to send them to my room.

733
01:08:42,077 --> 01:08:43,578
I'll pass them on to you.

734
01:08:52,671 --> 01:08:56,383
<i>She looked happier
when she came back this time.</i>

735
01:08:56,466 --> 01:08:59,469
<i>We talked more often.</i>

736
01:08:59,553 --> 01:09:02,139
Mr. Chow, another letter for you.

737
01:09:05,434 --> 01:09:07,269
Another one.

738
01:09:08,270 --> 01:09:10,480
Those Japanese girls get so carried away.

739
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:38,091
<i>Let's see each other again.</i>

740
01:09:40,677 --> 01:09:46,016
<i>Then, if you still think
we shouldn't be together...</i>

741
01:09:47,392 --> 01:09:49,478
<i>tell me so frankly.</i>

742
01:09:52,773 --> 01:09:54,608
<i>That day, six years ago...</i>

743
01:09:56,193 --> 01:09:59,821
<i>a rainbow appeared in my heart.</i>

744
01:09:59,905 --> 01:10:03,575
<i>It is still there,
like a flame burning inside me.</i>

745
01:10:06,620 --> 01:10:09,581
<i>But what are your real feelings for me?</i>

746
01:10:12,376 --> 01:10:18,673
<i>Are they like a rainbow after the rain?</i>

747
01:10:21,301 --> 01:10:22,386
Or...

748
01:10:25,847 --> 01:10:29,518
<i>did that rainbow fade away long ago?</i>

749
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:36,691
<i>I'm waiting for your answer.</i>

750
01:10:49,746 --> 01:10:52,165
Why do you write all that stuff about sex?

751
01:10:52,874 --> 01:10:54,334
So I won't starve.

752
01:10:55,710 --> 01:10:58,213
Don't you worry about your reputation?

753
01:11:01,049 --> 01:11:02,884
Maybe I'm not such a nice guy.

754
01:11:04,136 --> 01:11:05,846
Why not try writing something else?

755
01:11:05,929 --> 01:11:07,305
Who'd read it?

756
01:11:07,931 --> 01:11:09,599
How about a martial-arts novel?

757
01:11:09,683 --> 01:11:11,184
People love them.

758
01:11:12,185 --> 01:11:13,812
That's too hard.

759
01:11:14,438 --> 01:11:17,858
I tried co-writing one with someone once.

760
01:11:18,316 --> 01:11:20,610
We locked ourselves away for months.

761
01:11:21,611 --> 01:11:23,071
Just got sore heads.

762
01:11:24,656 --> 01:11:25,907
Those were good times.

763
01:11:29,161 --> 01:11:30,912
I like writing too.

764
01:11:30,996 --> 01:11:33,665
It's hard to make a living by writing.

765
01:11:34,749 --> 01:11:37,252
I just do it for fun.

766
01:11:38,170 --> 01:11:39,588
I'll show you some of my stuff.

767
01:11:39,671 --> 01:11:40,672
Please do.

768
01:11:50,223 --> 01:11:52,726
Here you are. Read this first.

769
01:11:58,773 --> 01:12:01,234
Wow, you're prolific.

770
01:12:01,902 --> 01:12:03,695
When you've read it,
tell me what you think.

771
01:12:03,778 --> 01:12:05,322
Don't forget to give it back.

772
01:12:05,405 --> 01:12:06,531
Of course.

773
01:12:28,845 --> 01:12:30,222
Have you read my story yet?

774
01:12:30,305 --> 01:12:31,348
I have.

775
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:33,350
What did you think?

776
01:12:37,354 --> 01:12:39,523
I think you should never
write another word.

777
01:12:41,316 --> 01:12:42,442
Why not?

778
01:12:46,279 --> 01:12:49,449
You're so good,
you could put me out of work.

779
01:12:56,540 --> 01:12:58,625
The Spider Sage
thrusts out his right fist.

780
01:12:58,708 --> 01:13:02,045
Two chopsticks take off like rockets.

781
01:13:02,128 --> 01:13:03,505
They land with explosive force.

782
01:13:03,588 --> 01:13:05,465
Kaboom. The mountain splits apart.

783
01:13:05,549 --> 01:13:08,468
Slow down. I can't keep up.

784
01:13:08,552 --> 01:13:10,387
Come on, they're waiting for it.

785
01:13:10,470 --> 01:13:11,471
All right, all right.

786
01:13:12,430 --> 01:13:13,557
Caught up?

787
01:13:14,349 --> 01:13:15,684
Go on.

788
01:13:16,601 --> 01:13:17,894
Where was I?

789
01:13:18,353 --> 01:13:19,980
"The mountain splits apart."

790
01:13:20,063 --> 01:13:22,065
Right. The mountain splits apart,

791
01:13:22,816 --> 01:13:24,734
smashing Iron Abacus to the ground.

792
01:13:24,818 --> 01:13:26,152
Iron Abacus?

793
01:13:26,820 --> 01:13:28,446
Isn't he dead?

794
01:13:31,491 --> 01:13:32,659
Is he?

795
01:13:33,785 --> 01:13:35,203
Then make it Iron Head.

796
01:13:35,287 --> 01:13:37,747
Where did Iron Head come from
all of a sudden?

797
01:13:37,831 --> 01:13:40,917
Hey, anything goes in martial-arts novels.

798
01:13:42,711 --> 01:13:45,338
Why don't you get some rest?
I'll finish it for you.

799
01:13:46,673 --> 01:13:47,674
Okay.

800
01:13:56,975 --> 01:13:58,643
<i>It felt like having an assistant.</i>

801
01:13:59,853 --> 01:14:03,481
<i>When I was late with my copy,
I asked her to ghostwrite it for me.</i>

802
01:14:04,816 --> 01:14:06,318
<i>She was just a girl,</i>

803
01:14:06,943 --> 01:14:09,988
<i>but she could write as raunchily
as the best of us.</i>

804
01:14:11,489 --> 01:14:13,283
<i>We got along very well.</i>

805
01:14:14,826 --> 01:14:17,704
<i>That was my happiest summer ever.</i>

806
01:14:20,582 --> 01:14:21,916
<i>But it didn't last.</i>

807
01:14:39,476 --> 01:14:41,811
<i>I encouraged her
to stand up to her father,</i>

808
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:44,105
<i>but she didn't dare.</i>

809
01:14:45,106 --> 01:14:46,858
<i>She wanted to pay her own way.</i>

810
01:14:47,776 --> 01:14:50,695
<i>So I got her a job
in the cloakroom at a club.</i>

811
01:14:51,905 --> 01:14:52,906
Thanks.

812
01:14:55,033 --> 01:14:57,077
<i>She told her father...</i>

813
01:14:58,411 --> 01:15:00,080
<i>she was going out with me.</i>

814
01:15:08,588 --> 01:15:12,342
<i>Sometimes I found an excuse
to pick her up after work.</i>

815
01:15:12,425 --> 01:15:14,010
You're here late.

816
01:15:14,094 --> 01:15:17,597
If you're ready to go,
I have a taxi waiting.

817
01:15:17,681 --> 01:15:19,391
I can give you a lift back.

818
01:15:24,896 --> 01:15:26,231
No, thanks.

819
01:15:30,694 --> 01:15:31,903
Then I won't wait.

820
01:15:56,136 --> 01:15:58,680
<i>Feelings can creep up on you unawares.</i>

821
01:16:00,849 --> 01:16:02,684
<i>I knew that, but did she?</i>

822
01:16:08,064 --> 01:16:09,816
<i>She was always asking</i>

823
01:16:09,899 --> 01:16:12,318
<i>if there was anything at all
that never changed.</i>

824
01:16:13,319 --> 01:16:15,155
<i>I could see what was on her mind.</i>

825
01:16:16,531 --> 01:16:20,118
<i>I promised to write a story for her
based on my observations,</i>

826
01:16:20,201 --> 01:16:22,787
<i>something to show her
what her boyfriend was thinking.</i>

827
01:16:23,580 --> 01:16:25,039
<i>Kind of a joke.</i>

828
01:16:25,582 --> 01:16:27,667
<i>We thought of calling it 2047.</i>

829
01:16:35,133 --> 01:16:37,093
<i>But maybe I was being too oblique.</i>

830
01:16:37,677 --> 01:16:40,221
<i>I'd begun to feel that it wasn't
about her boyfriend at all.</i>

831
01:16:41,848 --> 01:16:43,349
<i>Rather, it was more about me.</i>

832
01:17:13,338 --> 01:17:15,965
<i>So I began imagining myself
as a Japanese man...</i>

833
01:17:17,634 --> 01:17:19,969
<i>On a train headed for 2046...</i>

834
01:17:21,054 --> 01:17:23,473
<i>falling for an android
with delayed reactions.</i>

835
01:17:33,775 --> 01:17:37,445
<i>If someone wants to leave 2046,
how long will it take?</i>

836
01:17:37,529 --> 01:17:38,822
<i>No one can say.</i>

837
01:17:39,739 --> 01:17:41,991
<i>Some people get away fairly easily.</i>

838
01:17:42,742 --> 01:17:46,204
<i>Others find that it takes them
much longer.</i>

839
01:17:47,539 --> 01:17:51,125
<i>It takes great strength,
and it can hurt terribly.</i>

840
01:17:52,252 --> 01:17:54,879
<i>He forgets how long
he's been on this train.</i>

841
01:17:54,963 --> 01:17:56,714
<i>He starts to feel very lonely.</i>

842
01:17:56,798 --> 01:18:00,260
<i>It's rather boring at first,</i>

843
01:18:00,343 --> 01:18:02,387
<i>but you gradually get used to it.</i>

844
01:18:02,470 --> 01:18:04,889
We have a range of cabin attendants.

845
01:18:04,973 --> 01:18:07,308
They can satisfy your every need.

846
01:18:07,392 --> 01:18:10,979
They will serve you devotedly,
like an intimate friend.

847
01:18:11,771 --> 01:18:16,860
But you must never fall in love with them.

848
01:18:17,277 --> 01:18:19,279
Who'd ever fall for an android?

849
01:18:20,405 --> 01:18:21,781
Who can say?

850
01:18:21,865 --> 01:18:26,202
Events can creep up on you
without you even noticing.

851
01:18:26,786 --> 01:18:28,872
It happens all the time.

852
01:19:16,628 --> 01:19:18,796
<i>Paragraph 201 in the passengers' guide...</i>

853
01:19:19,797 --> 01:19:24,469
<i>warns that Zone 1224-1225
is especially cold.</i>

854
01:19:25,803 --> 01:19:28,514
<i>The train won't be able
to generate enough heat.</i>

855
01:19:28,598 --> 01:19:31,225
<i>Passengers are advised to hug each other
to keep warm.</i>

856
01:19:32,977 --> 01:19:35,021
<i>Since he's the only passenger,</i>

857
01:19:35,104 --> 01:19:37,273
<i>he hugs his android cabin attendant.</i>

858
01:19:42,195 --> 01:19:45,406
<i>He wonders if it's her mechanism
or just his imagination...</i>

859
01:19:47,158 --> 01:19:49,827
<i>but he senses some responsive warmth
in her artificial body.</i>

860
01:19:58,544 --> 01:19:59,837
That hurts.

861
01:20:02,215 --> 01:20:04,676
Why do you want to leave 2046?

862
01:20:11,224 --> 01:20:12,475
Do you know...

863
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:19,315
what people did in the old days when they
had secrets they didn't want to share?

864
01:20:26,030 --> 01:20:27,657
They'd climb a mountain...

865
01:20:28,825 --> 01:20:30,451
find a tree...

866
01:20:31,828 --> 01:20:34,038
carve a hole in it,

867
01:20:34,664 --> 01:20:40,878
whisper the secret into the hole...

868
01:20:43,006 --> 01:20:47,552
and cover it up with mud.

869
01:20:50,096 --> 01:20:51,690
That way,

870
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:56,685
nobody else would ever learn the secret.

871
01:21:08,823 --> 01:21:10,783
I'll be your tree.

872
01:21:12,201 --> 01:21:15,455
Tell me, and nobody else will ever know.

873
01:21:21,044 --> 01:21:22,211
I always...

874
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:26,966
I always...

875
01:21:29,010 --> 01:21:30,470
I always...

876
01:21:35,975 --> 01:21:38,186
Very funny. I always...

877
01:21:43,024 --> 01:21:44,442
I always...

878
01:21:46,194 --> 01:21:48,696
<i>Whenever anyone asked why he left 2046...</i>

879
01:21:48,780 --> 01:21:50,156
I always...

880
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:52,700
<i>...he gave them some vague answer.</i>

881
01:21:53,242 --> 01:21:54,577
I always...

882
01:21:59,749 --> 01:22:01,709
<i>He once fell in love with someone.</i>

883
01:22:03,169 --> 01:22:05,880
<i>He couldn't stop wondering
whether she loved him or not.</i>

884
01:22:08,591 --> 01:22:10,968
<i>He found an android
that looked just like her.</i>

885
01:22:12,595 --> 01:22:15,014
<i>He thought the android
might give him the answer.</i>

886
01:23:42,226 --> 01:23:45,438
<i>10 HOURS LATER</i>

887
01:24:16,177 --> 01:24:18,429
I have a secret to tell you.

888
01:24:22,350 --> 01:24:24,143
Leave with me.

889
01:24:32,568 --> 01:24:34,487
I have a secret to tell you.

890
01:24:37,114 --> 01:24:38,950
Leave with me.

891
01:24:45,331 --> 01:24:46,958
<i>He kept on asking...</i>

892
01:24:48,793 --> 01:24:50,628
<i>but she never answered.</i>

893
01:24:53,714 --> 01:24:55,883
<i>He began dreaming up excuses
for her silence.</i>

894
01:24:57,343 --> 01:25:00,763
Do you know the Buddhist canon?

895
01:25:00,846 --> 01:25:02,640
The five signs of decay
in celestial beings?

896
01:25:02,723 --> 01:25:04,443
The five signs of decay
in celestial beings.

897
01:25:05,685 --> 01:25:11,190
<i>It's all about the gods
and how they go through this process too.</i>

898
01:25:11,774 --> 01:25:16,612
<i>Our cabin attendants
are superbly designed...</i>

899
01:25:17,613 --> 01:25:20,533
<i>but there's one problem.</i>

900
01:25:21,117 --> 01:25:24,078
<i>After they've served
on so many long journeys,</i>

901
01:25:24,161 --> 01:25:26,664
<i>fatigue begins to set in.</i>

902
01:25:26,747 --> 01:25:30,668
<i>They might want to laugh,</i>

903
01:25:31,168 --> 01:25:33,671
<i>but the smile would be slow to come.</i>

904
01:25:34,755 --> 01:25:36,674
<i>They might want to cry,</i>

905
01:25:36,757 --> 01:25:40,594
<i>but the tears
wouldn't well up till next day.</i>

906
01:25:42,305 --> 01:25:45,808
<i>This one is failing fast.</i>

907
01:26:03,826 --> 01:26:06,704
<i>I think you'd better give up.</i>

908
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:24,347
<i>He grew desperate.</i>

909
01:26:25,639 --> 01:26:27,308
<i>He felt like giving up.</i>

910
01:26:29,810 --> 01:26:31,562
<i>But he was soon trying again.</i>

911
01:26:42,740 --> 01:26:45,826
<i>I have a secret to tell you.</i>

912
01:26:46,911 --> 01:26:48,871
<i>Will you leave with me?</i>

913
01:26:58,130 --> 01:27:02,385
I have a secret to tell you.

914
01:27:16,190 --> 01:27:18,067
Will you leave with me?

915
01:27:44,802 --> 01:27:47,847
Do you know what people
did in the old days

916
01:27:47,930 --> 01:27:49,348
when they had secrets?

917
01:28:01,527 --> 01:28:04,655
They'd climb a mountain, find a tree...

918
01:28:05,656 --> 01:28:07,241
carve a hole in it...

919
01:28:40,149 --> 01:28:41,984
990...

920
01:28:43,027 --> 01:28:45,446
991...

921
01:28:46,655 --> 01:28:48,991
992,

922
01:28:49,450 --> 01:28:51,952
993...

923
01:28:53,245 --> 01:28:55,956
994,

924
01:28:56,749 --> 01:28:58,584
995...

925
01:28:58,667 --> 01:29:01,545
<i>He slowly began to doubt himself.</i>

926
01:29:04,715 --> 01:29:06,342
<i>The reason she didn't answer...</i>

927
01:29:07,343 --> 01:29:09,720
<i>was not simply that
her reactions were delayed.</i>

928
01:29:09,803 --> 01:29:12,473
<i>It's simply that she didn't love him.</i>

929
01:29:14,099 --> 01:29:15,851
<i>So at last he got it.</i>

930
01:29:16,727 --> 01:29:19,438
<i>It's entirely beyond his control.</i>

931
01:29:19,522 --> 01:29:21,315
<i>The only thing left for him...</i>

932
01:29:22,816 --> 01:29:24,401
<i>was to give up.</i>

933
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:03,357
<i>DECEMBER 24, 1968</i>

934
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:20,476
Why did you invite me
to Christmas dinner?

935
01:31:20,559 --> 01:31:23,437
You know how much I'll lose in tips
by not working?

936
01:31:24,730 --> 01:31:28,859
Wouldn't it be awful to be alone tonight?

937
01:31:29,693 --> 01:31:31,445
I need company.

938
01:31:33,197 --> 01:31:34,448
That means me?

939
01:31:40,913 --> 01:31:42,998
Your boyfriend hasn't written in a while.

940
01:31:47,544 --> 01:31:49,338
I told him not to.

941
01:31:51,173 --> 01:31:52,966
Anyway, it's hopeless.

942
01:31:54,593 --> 01:31:56,387
No point waiting for me.

943
01:31:59,264 --> 01:32:02,476
Why is it hopeless? Go and look for him.

944
01:32:03,227 --> 01:32:06,021
If you don't, it really will be hopeless.

945
01:32:10,025 --> 01:32:11,944
My dad will never give his consent.

946
01:32:25,457 --> 01:32:29,670
If you were him,
what would you be doing tonight?

947
01:32:33,257 --> 01:32:35,050
Why don't you ask him?

948
01:32:35,134 --> 01:32:36,677
Have you got his phone number?

949
01:32:55,446 --> 01:32:56,447
Hello?

950
01:32:56,989 --> 01:32:59,032
I can't hear you.

951
01:32:59,533 --> 01:33:01,618
Can you speak louder?

952
01:33:04,163 --> 01:33:06,957
I'm already shouting!

953
01:33:08,167 --> 01:33:11,128
<i>I felt like Santa Claus that night.</i>

954
01:33:12,546 --> 01:33:14,465
<i>I took her to the newspaper office</i>

955
01:33:14,548 --> 01:33:17,259
<i>and let her make a long-distance call
to her boyfriend.</i>

956
01:33:18,218 --> 01:33:22,181
<i>I was happy to see her so happy.</i>

957
01:33:23,557 --> 01:33:25,976
<i>In fact, Zone 1224-1225</i>

958
01:33:26,602 --> 01:33:29,563
<i>meant Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.</i>

959
01:33:30,814 --> 01:33:32,483
<i>On the night before Christmas,</i>

960
01:33:32,566 --> 01:33:34,818
<i>many people need a bit more warmth
than usual.</i>

961
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:39,156
<i>That night, I didn't get that.</i>

962
01:33:41,283 --> 01:33:42,951
<i>Maybe that was for the best.</i>

963
01:34:31,750 --> 01:34:35,671
<i>10 HOURS LATER</i>

964
01:34:36,255 --> 01:34:40,926
<i>I realized that the reason
the android didn't answer</i>

965
01:34:41,009 --> 01:34:43,303
<i>had nothing to do
with her mechanism wearing out,</i>

966
01:34:43,804 --> 01:34:45,347
<i>nor that she didn't like him.</i>

967
01:34:46,139 --> 01:34:49,726
<i>More likely,
she already loved someone else.</i>

968
01:34:53,522 --> 01:34:55,440
<i>Soon after that, she went to Japan.</i>

969
01:34:57,609 --> 01:35:01,864
<i>I gave her a copy of my story 2047.</i>

970
01:35:02,531 --> 01:35:04,283
<i>I hope she read it.</i>

971
01:35:07,077 --> 01:35:11,039
<i>100 HOURS LATER</i>

972
01:35:15,544 --> 01:35:19,548
<i>1,000 HOURS LATER</i>

973
01:35:40,819 --> 01:35:42,905
<i>Love is all a matter of timing.</i>

974
01:35:44,489 --> 01:35:48,619
<i>It's no good meeting the right person
too soon or too late.</i>

975
01:36:00,756 --> 01:36:03,592
<i>If I'd lived in another time or place...</i>

976
01:36:04,927 --> 01:36:07,137
<i>My story might have had
a very different ending.</i>

977
01:36:56,853 --> 01:36:58,563
I have something to tell you.

978
01:36:58,647 --> 01:36:59,648
Yes?

979
01:37:00,190 --> 01:37:01,733
I'll be away for a couple of days.

980
01:37:01,817 --> 01:37:05,070
Please pay this month's rent
to my daughter.

981
01:37:05,153 --> 01:37:06,655
She's back?

982
01:37:06,738 --> 01:37:10,575
Not Jing-Wen.
I mean pay my younger girl, Jie-Wen.

983
01:37:12,452 --> 01:37:14,955
So your worries are over.
Going on holiday?

984
01:37:15,414 --> 01:37:17,708
No, I have to go to Japan.

985
01:37:18,458 --> 01:37:20,752
But you hate the Japanese.
Why go to Japan?

986
01:37:21,420 --> 01:37:23,505
Jing-Wen is getting married.

987
01:37:27,384 --> 01:37:28,635
Congratulations.

988
01:37:29,845 --> 01:37:32,681
I wasn't sure whether to go or not.

989
01:37:32,764 --> 01:37:36,393
Now I've decided.
I just want her to be happy.

990
01:37:38,145 --> 01:37:40,647
When do you leave?
Can you help me choose a present?

991
01:37:41,273 --> 01:37:42,315
No need for that.

992
01:37:45,736 --> 01:37:48,196
She wanted me to ask you something.

993
01:37:48,280 --> 01:37:49,281
What is it?

994
01:37:49,364 --> 01:37:53,201
She read your story <i>2047.</i>
She likes it a lot.

995
01:37:53,285 --> 01:37:56,246
But she finds the ending too sad.

996
01:37:56,329 --> 01:37:58,832
She wonders if you could change it.

997
01:38:02,044 --> 01:38:03,253
I'll see.

998
01:38:18,727 --> 01:38:22,647
<i>1 HOUR LATER</i>

999
01:38:35,702 --> 01:38:39,623
<i>10 HOURS LATER</i>

1000
01:38:47,631 --> 01:38:51,551
<i>100 HOURS LATER</i>

1001
01:39:17,077 --> 01:39:18,203
Taxi!

1002
01:39:18,620 --> 01:39:21,164
<i>I'd also like the story
to have a happy ending,</i>

1003
01:39:21,790 --> 01:39:23,667
<i>but I don't know how to write it.</i>

1004
01:39:24,626 --> 01:39:27,879
<i>Some years back,
I had a happy ending in my grasp...</i>

1005
01:39:29,005 --> 01:39:30,715
<i>but I let it slip away.</i>

1006
01:39:45,438 --> 01:39:46,898
Don't turn your back on me!

1007
01:39:47,983 --> 01:39:49,651
- Has he been here?
- What's it to you?

1008
01:39:49,734 --> 01:39:52,237
<i>While I was depressed,
I ran into Lulu again.</i>

1009
01:39:52,863 --> 01:39:54,507
<i>She hadn't changed —
still intensely jealous.</i>

1010
01:39:54,531 --> 01:39:57,117
You think he's yours?
I thought you knew him.

1011
01:39:57,200 --> 01:39:59,035
That's the way he is.

1012
01:39:59,119 --> 01:40:00,912
We've just been amusing ourselves.

1013
01:40:00,996 --> 01:40:03,415
So control yourself, Missy.

1014
01:40:31,902 --> 01:40:34,279
<i>Watching her taught me something.</i>

1015
01:40:36,156 --> 01:40:38,158
<i>When you don't take no for an answer,</i>

1016
01:40:38,241 --> 01:40:40,202
<i>there is still a chance
you'll get what you want.</i>

1017
01:40:57,844 --> 01:41:01,765
<i>18 MONTHS LATER</i>

1018
01:41:10,398 --> 01:41:13,777
Hello. Is Mr. Chow there?

1019
01:41:16,988 --> 01:41:20,992
I know I have no right to ask...

1020
01:41:21,993 --> 01:41:24,371
but they say I need a guarantor.

1021
01:41:26,915 --> 01:41:32,629
The man who recruits girls
for the nightclub says he knows you.

1022
01:41:34,464 --> 01:41:36,132
Can you talk to him for me?

1023
01:41:41,137 --> 01:41:42,305
No problem.

1024
01:41:43,765 --> 01:41:45,433
I know the man you mean.

1025
01:41:47,978 --> 01:41:49,562
I'll see him in a day or two.

1026
01:41:51,189 --> 01:41:52,941
Why did you choose Singapore?

1027
01:41:54,651 --> 01:41:56,861
I don't want to stay here any longer.

1028
01:41:58,154 --> 01:42:01,700
I've been thinking about it for some time.

1029
01:42:01,783 --> 01:42:03,827
I want to take a look at the place.

1030
01:42:07,330 --> 01:42:08,832
Don't drink too much.

1031
01:42:09,916 --> 01:42:11,251
You don't look well.

1032
01:42:14,838 --> 01:42:18,091
Don't worry. It won't kill me.

1033
01:42:24,764 --> 01:42:26,016
You know what?

1034
01:42:27,851 --> 01:42:30,520
I came by here at Christmas.

1035
01:42:33,732 --> 01:42:35,358
I thought I might run into you.

1036
01:42:36,609 --> 01:42:38,236
Why didn't you call me first?

1037
01:42:39,904 --> 01:42:41,281
I don't know.

1038
01:42:43,616 --> 01:42:45,035
I came on impulse.

1039
01:42:55,253 --> 01:42:56,880
I don't know why.

1040
01:43:00,342 --> 01:43:02,552
That night,
I suddenly missed you so much.

1041
01:43:08,558 --> 01:43:11,019
We're drinking pals.

1042
01:43:11,644 --> 01:43:13,271
Of course you'd miss me.

1043
01:43:20,695 --> 01:43:22,030
You're right.

1044
01:43:26,618 --> 01:43:28,536
We're drinking pals.

1045
01:43:39,923 --> 01:43:41,132
Let's go.

1046
01:43:43,468 --> 01:43:44,719
- Waiter.
- Yes.

1047
01:43:44,803 --> 01:43:46,388
- The check.
- Yes.

1048
01:43:49,599 --> 01:43:50,892
Where are you staying?

1049
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:56,356
I rent a apartment, a rather small place.

1050
01:43:57,899 --> 01:43:59,150
But it's not too bad.

1051
01:44:00,318 --> 01:44:01,444
I'll see you back.

1052
01:44:02,904 --> 01:44:04,239
No, thanks.

1053
01:44:05,198 --> 01:44:07,534
I've just moved in. It's a mess.

1054
01:44:09,661 --> 01:44:11,579
I'll invite you over once it's cleaned up.

1055
01:44:14,249 --> 01:44:15,250
I'll go first.

1056
01:44:33,143 --> 01:44:35,311
<i>Seeing how much Bai Ling had changed,</i>

1057
01:44:35,395 --> 01:44:37,856
<i>I was suddenly overcome
by a feeling of grief.</i>

1058
01:44:37,939 --> 01:44:41,401
<i>Indeed, last Christmas,
I wasn't in Hong Kong.</i>

1059
01:44:42,610 --> 01:44:46,448
<i>DECEMBER 24, 1969</i>

1060
01:45:06,634 --> 01:45:08,845
Have you seen Miss Su?

1061
01:45:08,928 --> 01:45:12,307
Miss Su? Not for some time.

1062
01:45:12,765 --> 01:45:14,225
Any idea where she might be?

1063
01:45:14,309 --> 01:45:16,144
Probably back in Phnom Penh.

1064
01:45:17,479 --> 01:45:20,857
<i>I didn't want to spend Christmas 1969
in Hong Kong,</i>

1065
01:45:21,399 --> 01:45:24,944
<i>so I visited Singapore
and went back to the casino.</i>

1066
01:45:26,404 --> 01:45:29,324
<i>I waited for several days,
but Black Spider never turned up.</i>

1067
01:45:29,866 --> 01:45:31,326
<i>No one knew where she was.</i>

1068
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:34,370
<i>Some thought
she'd gone back to Phnom Penh.</i>

1069
01:45:34,454 --> 01:45:36,372
<i>Others thought she was dead.</i>

1070
01:45:40,710 --> 01:45:43,546
<i>Ping and I
began working in Singapore in 1963...</i>

1071
01:45:45,215 --> 01:45:47,258
<i>when my life lost most of its meaning.</i>

1072
01:45:49,385 --> 01:45:51,387
<i>I started gambling every day.</i>

1073
01:45:56,518 --> 01:45:58,061
<i>Those were hard times for me.</i>

1074
01:45:58,144 --> 01:46:02,065
<i>Only one person came to my rescue,
a professional gambler.</i>

1075
01:46:02,524 --> 01:46:04,484
<i>Some said she was a cheat.</i>

1076
01:46:05,777 --> 01:46:08,738
<i>She always wore black.
They called her Black Spider.</i>

1077
01:46:09,948 --> 01:46:12,492
<i>She kept her black glove on
365 days of the year.</i>

1078
01:46:13,660 --> 01:46:15,370
<i>Nobody knew why for sure.</i>

1079
01:46:16,704 --> 01:46:19,832
<i>Had her hand been chopped off
for cheating?</i>

1080
01:46:19,916 --> 01:46:22,418
<i>Did the glove cover up a fake hand?</i>

1081
01:46:23,461 --> 01:46:25,046
<i>Nobody really knew.</i>

1082
01:46:45,441 --> 01:46:47,360
Why do you wear that black glove?

1083
01:46:49,612 --> 01:46:50,863
It's a habit.

1084
01:46:52,991 --> 01:46:54,325
You're not from here.

1085
01:46:56,286 --> 01:46:57,704
I'm from Phnom Penh.

1086
01:46:59,747 --> 01:47:04,085
What a coincidence.
I was just in Cambodia.

1087
01:47:08,339 --> 01:47:11,009
The place is in chaos.
What were you doing there?

1088
01:47:13,011 --> 01:47:14,596
The newspaper sent me.

1089
01:47:17,807 --> 01:47:19,225
You're a journalist?

1090
01:47:20,560 --> 01:47:21,853
Not anymore.

1091
01:47:23,980 --> 01:47:25,148
Why's that?

1092
01:47:28,901 --> 01:47:33,281
They made some changes,
and now I'm a consultant —

1093
01:47:33,364 --> 01:47:36,492
on half-pay, with next to nothing to do.

1094
01:47:42,582 --> 01:47:45,043
So why are you spending your time
in the casino?

1095
01:47:47,420 --> 01:47:49,541
I tried to win enough
to pay my way back to Hong Kong.

1096
01:47:54,469 --> 01:47:56,137
You lost a lot?

1097
01:47:56,596 --> 01:47:58,264
A few thousand dollars.

1098
01:48:03,978 --> 01:48:06,648
You should never set foot in a casino
in a bad mood.

1099
01:48:07,482 --> 01:48:09,067
You won't win.

1100
01:48:12,528 --> 01:48:14,155
I didn't expect to win.

1101
01:48:14,238 --> 01:48:16,115
I just hoped to get back my stake.

1102
01:48:22,914 --> 01:48:24,582
If you have anything left...

1103
01:48:27,126 --> 01:48:28,670
I can help you.

1104
01:48:30,046 --> 01:48:31,673
On one condition.

1105
01:48:31,756 --> 01:48:35,343
When you've got your money back,
you stop gambling.

1106
01:48:43,351 --> 01:48:44,852
Why are you helping me?

1107
01:48:46,562 --> 01:48:47,980
I take a commission.

1108
01:48:49,357 --> 01:48:52,568
Ten percent of whatever I win for you.

1109
01:48:58,199 --> 01:48:59,742
Think it over.

1110
01:49:06,416 --> 01:49:09,293
<i>What good to her
was her tiny commission on my winnings?</i>

1111
01:49:10,962 --> 01:49:13,673
<i>After that, we went back to the casino
night after night.</i>

1112
01:49:13,756 --> 01:49:16,759
<i>We'd eat at the stall
next to the railway station.</i>

1113
01:49:17,802 --> 01:49:21,139
<i>She won back all the money I'd lost.</i>

1114
01:49:29,731 --> 01:49:30,732
Thank you.

1115
01:49:32,525 --> 01:49:34,193
Don't thank me. It's yours.

1116
01:49:39,115 --> 01:49:41,159
If you need me again tomorrow,

1117
01:49:41,242 --> 01:49:43,161
I'll be waiting here after dinner.

1118
01:49:47,874 --> 01:49:49,667
I still don't know your name.

1119
01:49:55,798 --> 01:49:58,593
My family name is Su.
My full name is Su Li-Zhen.

1120
01:50:04,390 --> 01:50:08,060
<i>A few years ago,
I fell in love with another man's wife.</i>

1121
01:50:08,144 --> 01:50:10,229
<i>Her name was also Su Li-Zhen.</i>

1122
01:50:14,567 --> 01:50:17,570
<i>It was because of her
that I moved to Singapore.</i>

1123
01:50:19,322 --> 01:50:22,950
<i>I never dreamed
I'd meet another Su Li-Zhen.</i>

1124
01:50:28,873 --> 01:50:32,251
<i>I told her a lot
about the other Su Li-Zhen.</i>

1125
01:50:33,044 --> 01:50:35,171
At first, we kept it secret,

1126
01:50:35,713 --> 01:50:37,340
but gossip soon spread.

1127
01:50:38,591 --> 01:50:40,426
Later we moved into a hotel.

1128
01:50:41,093 --> 01:50:43,137
We had Room 2046.

1129
01:50:46,432 --> 01:50:48,893
When I think back,
the whole thing was like a dream.

1130
01:50:50,436 --> 01:50:52,104
You loved her deeply?

1131
01:50:58,444 --> 01:50:59,612
It's history.

1132
01:51:02,281 --> 01:51:03,908
Let's change the subject.

1133
01:51:04,534 --> 01:51:06,994
You, what did you do before?

1134
01:51:13,709 --> 01:51:15,711
You want to know about me?

1135
01:51:24,804 --> 01:51:26,806
Come on, we'll play high-low.

1136
01:51:26,889 --> 01:51:29,225
If you win, I'll tell you everything.

1137
01:51:47,660 --> 01:51:51,956
<i>It struck me that her past was like
the hand she always kept gloved —</i>

1138
01:51:52,039 --> 01:51:53,249
<i>a mystery with no solution.</i>

1139
01:52:10,182 --> 01:52:15,271
Of all the men I've known,
you've been the best to me.

1140
01:52:20,026 --> 01:52:22,236
I'm already missing you.

1141
01:52:30,411 --> 01:52:31,871
Why won't you come with me?

1142
01:52:37,919 --> 01:52:39,045
Didn't you...

1143
01:52:41,380 --> 01:52:42,798
promise not to ask?

1144
01:52:48,429 --> 01:52:50,765
Hold me.

1145
01:52:53,559 --> 01:52:55,686
It may be years before we meet again.

1146
01:53:43,401 --> 01:53:45,319
<i>That night, we saw each other
for the last time.</i>

1147
01:53:45,403 --> 01:53:46,654
<i>I told her...</i>

1148
01:53:47,196 --> 01:53:48,572
Take care.

1149
01:53:51,200 --> 01:53:53,536
Maybe one day you'll escape your past.

1150
01:53:55,287 --> 01:53:57,039
If you do, look for me.

1151
01:55:20,998 --> 01:55:25,211
<i>Now it strikes me that what I told her
was actually meant for myself.</i>

1152
01:55:27,421 --> 01:55:29,799
<i>In love, you can't bring on a substitute.</i>

1153
01:55:30,674 --> 01:55:34,470
<i>I was looking for what I'd felt
with the other Su Li-Zhen.</i>

1154
01:55:35,846 --> 01:55:37,681
<i>I didn't realize that myself...</i>

1155
01:55:38,849 --> 01:55:40,810
<i>but I'm sure she did.</i>

1156
01:55:57,118 --> 01:55:59,662
<i>WHEN THE PEONY BLOOMS,</i>

1157
01:55:59,745 --> 01:56:02,456
<i>SHE STANDS TALL AND THEN GOES AWAY.</i>

1158
01:56:02,540 --> 01:56:05,042
<i>DOES SHE MEAN NO OR YES?</i>

1159
01:56:05,793 --> 01:56:08,129
All for me? You want to get me drunk?

1160
01:56:08,212 --> 01:56:10,214
I know you're a good drinker.

1161
01:56:10,297 --> 01:56:12,133
Let's drink —

1162
01:56:12,216 --> 01:56:14,093
as much as we can.

1163
01:56:15,177 --> 01:56:17,346
If there's any left over,

1164
01:56:17,930 --> 01:56:20,599
finish it next time you're here.

1165
01:56:30,151 --> 01:56:32,403
There's one small thing
I have to ask of you.

1166
01:56:32,486 --> 01:56:34,697
Here's some money. Please take it.

1167
01:56:35,156 --> 01:56:36,282
What for?

1168
01:56:37,533 --> 01:56:41,245
I know you borrowed money from a friend
for my plane ticket.

1169
01:56:42,288 --> 01:56:43,622
Pay him back.

1170
01:56:44,290 --> 01:56:47,543
If there's any left, pay my rent for me.

1171
01:56:50,379 --> 01:56:52,006
Where did you get so much money?

1172
01:56:54,884 --> 01:56:56,427
An old customer.

1173
01:56:58,179 --> 01:57:00,639
He's always been fond of me.

1174
01:57:00,723 --> 01:57:02,516
He treats me well.

1175
01:57:03,142 --> 01:57:06,979
But he's too old for me,
so I never paid him much attention.

1176
01:57:10,649 --> 01:57:13,027
I ran into him yesterday
while I was shopping.

1177
01:57:13,736 --> 01:57:16,155
He insisted on buying me dinner.

1178
01:57:19,283 --> 01:57:22,953
I needed money, so I went.

1179
01:57:25,748 --> 01:57:29,418
After dinner, I told him I needed money.

1180
01:57:31,420 --> 01:57:35,341
He said I could have as much as I wanted.

1181
01:57:39,970 --> 01:57:42,056
I told him I needed $5,000.

1182
01:57:45,559 --> 01:57:48,229
At first,
I planned to save it for Singapore.

1183
01:57:50,856 --> 01:57:52,900
But I'm using it now.

1184
01:57:58,364 --> 01:57:59,823
Don't be silly.

1185
01:58:00,449 --> 01:58:04,411
You're still young.
You have great prospects.

1186
01:58:05,829 --> 01:58:08,332
I borrowed the money from my friends.

1187
01:58:08,415 --> 01:58:10,209
They don't need it back yet.

1188
01:58:11,585 --> 01:58:13,003
Keep this for yourself.

1189
01:58:18,217 --> 01:58:20,219
Pay me back later. There's no rush.

1190
01:58:24,848 --> 01:58:26,642
Why are you so kind to me?

1191
01:58:28,519 --> 01:58:30,312
Perhaps it's fate.

1192
01:58:39,446 --> 01:58:41,323
Too bad it didn't last.

1193
01:58:43,575 --> 01:58:45,619
I wish it could have gone on longer.

1194
01:58:48,664 --> 01:58:50,624
Don't be like this.

1195
01:58:50,708 --> 01:58:52,334
Let me buy you dinner tonight.

1196
01:58:53,335 --> 01:58:55,379
- Waiter, the check.
- Coming.

1197
01:58:55,921 --> 01:58:57,298
No, let me.

1198
01:58:58,799 --> 01:59:00,968
You're too kind.

1199
01:59:02,136 --> 01:59:05,514
You've spent enough time and money
on me already.

1200
01:59:06,473 --> 01:59:08,434
I don't want to owe you too much.

1201
01:59:15,399 --> 01:59:17,067
I need to make a phone call.

1202
01:59:18,193 --> 01:59:21,196
Please settle the check. I'll be outside.

1203
02:00:22,549 --> 02:00:24,259
Will you come in?

1204
02:00:25,386 --> 02:00:27,221
No, thanks.

1205
02:00:27,304 --> 02:00:28,806
Get some rest.

1206
02:00:29,556 --> 02:00:31,558
I'll see you to the airport tomorrow.

1207
02:00:32,810 --> 02:00:33,977
Please don't.

1208
02:00:35,145 --> 02:00:37,106
I'll be terribly sad if you're there.

1209
02:00:41,568 --> 02:00:43,278
Take good care of yourself.

1210
02:00:59,086 --> 02:01:01,588
Why can't it be like it was before?

1211
02:01:05,050 --> 02:01:06,260
Please don't go.

1212
02:01:08,512 --> 02:01:10,472
Stay with me tonight.

1213
02:01:14,810 --> 02:01:16,186
Let me borrow you.

1214
02:01:17,563 --> 02:01:19,481
Do you remember?

1215
02:01:20,858 --> 02:01:24,736
You once asked me
if there was anything I wouldn't lend.

1216
02:01:27,072 --> 02:01:29,158
I've given it a lot of thought.

1217
02:01:31,118 --> 02:01:32,703
And now I know.

1218
02:01:34,997 --> 02:01:36,999
There is one thing...

1219
02:01:39,751 --> 02:01:41,795
I'll never lend to anyone.

1220
02:02:27,341 --> 02:02:31,637
<i>As I recall, that was the very last time
we saw each other.</i>

1221
02:02:33,055 --> 02:02:35,724
<i>I haven't seen her since that night.</i>

1222
02:02:48,487 --> 02:02:50,864
<i>Why can't it be like it was before?</i>

1223
02:02:59,873 --> 02:03:02,042
<i>HE DIDN'T TURN BACK.</i>

1224
02:03:02,125 --> 02:03:04,503
<i>IT WAS AS IF HE'D BOARDED

1227

<i>Everyone who goes to 2046
has the same intention.</i>

1228
02:03:18,267 --> 02:03:20,519
<i>They want to recapture lost memories.</i>

1229
02:03:21,478 --> 02:03:25,774
<i>Because in 2046, nothing ever changes.</i>

1230
02:03:27,025 --> 02:03:29,611
<i>But nobody really knows
if that's true or not...</i>

1231
02:03:30,612 --> 02:03:33,574
<i>because nobody has ever come back.</i>
