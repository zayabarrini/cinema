Are we still partners?

3
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:40,624
<i>We've been business partners
for 155 weeks now</i>

4
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:43,293
<i>We're sitting next to each other
for the first time today,</i>

5
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:45,754
<i>We seldom see each other.</i>

6
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:49,132
<i>I know too well that man
can hardly control his passion.</i>

7
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,802
<i>Partners should never get
emotionally involved with each other.</i>

FALLEN ANGELS

9
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:34,232
<i>A message for 3662.</i>

10
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,443
<i>I'm meeting his friends tomorrow</i>

11
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,696
<i>Ask him to let me know where.</i>

12
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:58,799
<i>Most people work from 9..00 to 5..00.</i>

13
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,551
<i>I'm just the opposite.</i>

14
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:04,679
<i>My job is simple.</i>

15
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:08,141
<i>I visit some "friends"
once in a while.</i>

16
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:11,019
<i>I don't know any of them.</i>

17
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:13,897
<i>And I'm not interested
in them either.</i>

18
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:16,650
<i>Because they'll soon be gone forever.</i>

19
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:02,297
Going out?

20
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,673
Yes.

21
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:11,806
<i>One's profession is very often
determined by one's personality,</i>

22
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,352
<i>The best thing about my profession</i>

23
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,312
<i>is there's no need
to make any decisions.</i>

24
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,231
<i>Who's to die, when, where-</i>

25
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:22,150
<i>it's all been planned by others.</i>

26
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,902
<i>I'm a lazy person.</i>

27
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:27,197
<i>I like people to arrange things for me.</i>

28
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:29,824
<i>That's why I need a partner.</i>

29
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,149
Ming?

30
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:11,528
Ming!

31
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,864
You're Ming, aren't you?

32
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,408
Remember me?
My name's Hoi.

33
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:21,371
Don't you remember me?
I was always number one in grade school.

34
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:22,831
- Remember?
- Yeah.

35
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,165
What a coincidence!

36
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,836
If my Mercedes hadn't broken down,
I wouldn't have run into you here.

37
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:31,047
<i>Every person has his own past.</i>

38
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:32,757
<i>Even if you're a killer,</i>

39
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:35,218
<i>you still have classmates
from grade school around</i>

40
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:36,970
<i>Every time I run into them,</i>

41
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:39,764
<i>they ask me the same questions.</i>

42
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,309
What kind of work do you do?

43
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,729
Give me your card
so we can keep in touch.

44
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:48,773
Maybe we could work together.

45
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:51,609
That would be great.
Always lookin' to make a buck.

46
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,991
Your own business?
That's worth breaking your back for!

47
00:10:58,116 --> 00:10:59,909
You married?

48
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,745
Don't tell me you can't find a girl!

49
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:05,748
What? A son!

50
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,876
Looks exactly like you!

51
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:11,421
What's this-your wife's black?

52
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:15,341
I mean... smart move!
Black grows on you.

53
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:17,594
Your skin color's different,

54
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,804
but you make a nice couple.

55
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:22,265
Hey, are you insured?

56
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:24,100
Maybe you can help me out.

57
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,227
I've been in the business
over ten years.

58
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:27,604
You might not know,

59
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:32,567
but I'm rated the top insurance broker
in all Southeast Asia.

60
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:36,571
I'm being interviewed
by the newspaper in a <i>few</i> days.

61
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,865
For old time's sake,

62
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:44,412
I'll work out the best plan for you.
You never can tell.

63
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,081
God forbid, but what if
something should happen?

64
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,958
It's not just for you.

65
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,628
I see you travel a lot for work.

66
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:54,714
If not for yourself,
think about your wife and little boy.

67
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:59,510
<i>I often wonder if any insurance company
would insure a professional killer.</i>

68
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:01,596
<i>I'd really like to help him out,</i>

69
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,932
<i>but I wouldn't know
whom to name as beneficiary.</i>

70
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:07,644
Remember that girl with the big boobs?
The one we were both after years ago?

71
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,980
We're getting married next week.
Here's an invitation.

72
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,068
Sorry-just write your own name on it.

73
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:18,488
Come a little early.
I'll write up the policy for you.

74
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:20,406
And bring your wife.
Bye-bye.

75
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,329
<i>A few years back, I paid a black woman
$30 to have her picture taken with me,</i>

76
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:29,666
<i>so that if people asked,
I could say she was my wife.</i>

77
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:33,211
<i>And the kid in the picture-
I just bought him an ice-cream cone.</i>

78
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,340
<i>I've always wanted to go
to a wedding,</i>

79
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:42,011
<i>but I know very well
it's not my kind of scene.</i>

80
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:40,546
<i>Going through a person's trash</i>

81
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:43,758
<i>can tell you a lot about them.</i>

82
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:48,221
<i>He comes to this bar a lot.</i>

83
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:51,015
<i>Maybe 'cause it's quiet.</i>

84
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,813
<i>Sometimes I sit in his usual seat.</i>

85
00:14:58,106 --> 00:15:00,900
<i>Lets me feel close to him.</i>

86
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:10,993
<i>Some people you really don't want
to get too close to.</i>

87
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:16,374
<i>Find out too much about a person
and you lose interest.</i>

88
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:22,713
<i>I'm the practical kind</i>

89
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:26,050
<i>I know how to make myself happy,</i>

90
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:04,620
No, he hasn't come back yet.

91
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,080
You telling the truth?

92
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,666
Why should I lie?

93
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:14,088
- You live here?
- Something wrong with that?

94
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,881
Have you seen this person around?

95
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:17,466
No.

96
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:31,439
Don't come out yet.

97
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:33,566
The cops are still here.

98
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:48,998
You know where he is. Tell us.

99
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:52,042
<i>You rub elbows
with a lot of people everyday,</i>

100
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:56,005
<i>Some strangers might become
your friends or even confidants.</i>

101
00:20:57,047 --> 00:21:01,135
<i>But I know very well these cops
will never be my confidants.</i>

102
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:03,721
<i>My name is Ho Chi Moo.</i>

103
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:05,806
<i>I was prisoner number 223.</i>

104
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:09,810
I haven't seen him in days.
I'll let you know when he comes back.

105
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:13,689
I saw him come in.
You'd better tell the truth.

106
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:19,737
Stop making faces!
Stand still!

107
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:41,217
<i>I'm a happy man.</i>

108
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,385
<i>I was very talkative when I was small.</i>

109
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:47,556
<i>But at age five, I ate
a can of pineapple that had expired,</i>

110
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:50,893
<i>and I stopped talking.</i>

111
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:54,438
<i>For that reason,
I have very few friends.</i>

112
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:57,858
<i>I found it very hard
to find work too.</i>

113
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,778
<i>I finally decided to be my own boss.</i>

114
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:21,882
<i>Having no capital,
the only thing I can do</i>

115
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,134
<i>is sneak into
other people's shops after hours</i>

116
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,554
<i>and run my own business.</i>

117
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:28,889
<i>I'm not a freeloader.</i>

118
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:32,810
<i>I just think it makes sense,
since the rent's already been paid,</i>

119
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:34,812
<i>to run the business around the clock.</i>

120
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:37,565
<i>Who says nobody
buys pork at 3.-00 a.m.?</i>

121
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,775
<i>I came yesterday
to buy some, didn't I?</i>

122
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:41,819
<i>If you want to do business,</i>

123
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:44,113
<i>you have to take
each customer's needs into account.</i>

124
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:49,159
<i>Buddha said,
"If I don't descend into hell, who will?"</i>

125
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:51,120
<i>When you're the boss,
you have to be kind,</i>

126
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:52,705
<i>caring and tolerant.</i>

127
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,957
<i>You can't just look to your own gain.</i>

128
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:58,377
<i>I know very well
there's no such thing as a free lunch,</i>

129
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:02,172
<i>so I always work very hard
until the wee hours.</i>

130
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:05,843
<i>I don't make a lot of money,
but I'm happy,</i>

131
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,863
Are you nuts? Why should I let you
wash my clothes?

132
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:27,948
I'm a beggar.
I don't need laundry done!

133
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,326
I don't need it!

134
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,661
Leave me alone!

135
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:35,748
Are you nuts?
Keep your hands off my clothes!

136
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:38,208
Give me back my clothes!

137
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:40,753
Hands off!
I'll beat you up!

138
00:23:40,878 --> 00:23:42,504
Okay, I'll pay!

139
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:46,550
I'll pay you,
if it's money you want.

140
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,177
You're a lunatic!

141
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:53,349
Don't push me!
I don't want any eggplant!

142
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,434
You can't make me buy it!

143
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:59,229
I'm single.
What would people think?

144
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:00,689
Not even if they're free!

145
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:02,691
I'll take some melon.

146
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:06,654
Here!

147
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:15,371
This is huge!
Are you out of your mind?

148
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:19,583
Stop that!

149
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:24,046
I washed my hair yesterday.

150
00:24:30,678 --> 00:24:32,262
Ouch! Easy!

151
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:36,392
My head doesn't itch-
stop scratching it!

152
00:24:38,394 --> 00:24:40,688
I just came down for a late snack.

153
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:42,940
I don't need a shampoo.

154
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:49,405
I give up.
Do whatever you want.

155
00:24:54,702 --> 00:24:56,245
No!

156
00:24:58,414 --> 00:25:00,833
I don't want a shave!

157
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,633
Hands off!

158
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:18,017
Listen, I'm no regular guy.
I have underworld connections.

159
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:24,857
I really don't want a shave.
How about-

160
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:27,443
I'll pay you, okay?

161
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:33,198
A double cone, please.

162
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:36,952
Oh, no, it's you!

163
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:38,871
Sorry.

164
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:52,676
Stop pulling my hair.

165
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:55,304
I'll climb in myself.

166
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:59,308
Sorry!

167
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:04,146
I'm coming in.

168
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:14,114
Hello? It's me.
What are you doing?

169
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:19,328
Go to bed. Don't wait for me.

170
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:23,332
I'm having some ice cream.

171
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:28,128
Uh, no, it's more than a scoop or two.

172
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:32,007
I don't know how much more
I'll have to eat.

173
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:37,054
No, it's not an eating contest.
Of course I'll have to pay!

174
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:44,269
Yeah, but this guy won't let me...

175
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:47,856
I don't know how to explain,
but it's the truth.

176
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:51,944
Come see for yourself
if you don't believe me.

177
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:53,612
Hello?

178
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:01,286
No, I can't eat that!

179
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:07,292
What if my mustache catches on fire?

180
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:10,629
This isn't funny anymore.

181
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:16,385
Why are you doing this?

182
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,221
I said to come by yourself.

183
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:21,557
I didn't tell you
to bring the whole family.

184
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:24,977
Dad's too old for all this ice cream.

185
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:27,396
What if something happens?

186
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:31,441
The kids have to go to school tomorrow.

187
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:34,069
Think about that.

188
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:44,246
Has anyone in Hong Kong ever died
from too much ice cream?

189
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:47,457
I don't want to be the first.

190
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,794
I'll pay you, okay?

191
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:55,549
Name a price.
I'll buy it all. Please.

192
00:27:58,594 --> 00:28:01,597
<i>My ice cream may be
a bit more expensive,</i>

193
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:04,516
<i>but I think this family
is having a great time.</i>

194
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:08,270
<i>I love ice cream.</i>

195
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:12,357
<i>When I was little, an ice cream truck
would stop by my house every day,</i>

196
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:15,611
<i>I was always happy to see it.</i>

197
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:20,282
<i>Once I asked my dad
why he didn't drive an ice cream truck.</i>

198
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:22,993
<i>He didn't answer.</i>

199
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,661
<i>I later found out</i>

200
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:27,456
<i>my mother had been run over
by an ice cream truck.</i>

201
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:31,668
<i>I was born in Taiwan.</i>

202
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:34,546
<i>I came to Hong Kong
with my dad when I was five.</i>

203
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:37,716
<i>He worked as an assistant
at the Chungking Mansions Hotel.</i>

204
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:42,304
<i>He's rarely talked
since my mother died</i>

205
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:44,348
<i>No more ice cream, of course.</i>

206
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,894
<i>Maybe the fact
we're both so quiet</i>

207
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:51,563
<i>explains why we've always been close.</i>

208
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:56,985
Why are you being so nice to me?

209
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,987
You even bought me ice cream.

210
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:02,366
You should know
I don't like ice cream.

211
00:29:18,382 --> 00:29:21,927
It's too cold!

212
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:24,680
It's bad for my health.
Gives me the runs.

213
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:39,528
Are you nuts?

214
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:57,504
Hey, open up!
What game are you playing now?

215
00:29:58,213 --> 00:29:59,715
Open this door!

216
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,759
What are you doing?

217
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:05,178
I'll kill you!

218
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:08,056
Open this door!
Stop playing around!

219
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:24,740
<i>9090.</i>

220
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,576
<i>I'd like to leave a message.</i>

221
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:30,078
<i>I'm meeting his friends tomorrow</i>

222
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:32,664
<i>He should let me know where.</i>

223
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:19,646
I get it. It's clear.

224
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:25,026
I just wanna make sure
the address was correct.

225
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:28,113
It was a fast-food store,
not a barber shop.

226
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:31,867
<i>You may think
we must be making a lot of money,</i>

227
00:32:31,992 --> 00:32:34,494
<i>But how much is a human life worth?</i>

228
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,329
<i>Demand comes and goes.</i>

229
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:39,040
<i>It's not unusual to have
no business for months.</i>

230
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:41,001
<i>So, once in a while</i>

231
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:43,670
<i>I moonlight in the financial field</i>

232
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:46,047
<i>Like debt collection.</i>

233
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:47,257
Thanks.

234
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:53,805
Hold on.
I'll get you the money.

235
00:32:58,393 --> 00:32:59,144
Here.

236
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:38,326
<i>I don't know why,
but I've been injured a lot lately</i>

237
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:42,372
<i>I hate digging bullets
out of my own body</i>

238
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:45,041
<i>It's exhausting.</i>

239
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:53,049
<i>I turned in early that night,</i>

240
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:56,720
<i>knowing when I woke up the next day,
I'd have to make a decision.</i>

241
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:12,694
Lady, we're closed.

242
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:17,949
<i>Two weeks after I was injured,
I asked to see her.</i>

243
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:20,535
<i>I wanted to tell her my decision.</i>

244
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:24,873
<i>But I didn't show up.</i>

245
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:52,442
<i>I'm sure she'll look for me here
in the next couple days.</i>

246
00:35:52,734 --> 00:35:56,446
<i>I know that because
we've been partners for so long.</i>

247
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:04,871
<i>As her partner, it's not enough
for me to understand her.</i>

248
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:07,999
<i>I have to let her understand me too.</i>

249
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:12,253
<i>So sometimes I leave clues</i>

250
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:16,007
<i>so she can trace
my actions and whereabouts.</i>

251
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:21,554
<i>She's become part of my life
these past years.</i>

252
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:30,438
<i>But things always change.</i>

253
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:34,901
<i>I desperately want to tell her
that I want to quit,</i>

254
00:36:35,485 --> 00:36:37,362
<i>but I don't know how to start.</i>

255
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:42,117
<i>So I've devised another way,</i>

256
00:36:47,247 --> 00:36:50,166
A woman may come asking for me
in the next few days.

257
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:51,918
Please give her this coin.

258
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:54,629
Tell her 1818 is my lucky number.

259
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:08,393
<i>1818.</i>

260
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:11,187
<i>The number of one
of the songs in this jukebox</i>

261
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:14,190
<i>When she hears the song,</i>

262
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:16,276
<i>she'll understand my message.</i>

263
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:39,466
<i>Forget him</i>

264
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:44,637
<i>And it's like forgetting everything</i>

265
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:50,018
<i>It's like losing all direction</i>

266
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:54,022
<i>Losing oneself</i>

267
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:59,319
<i>Forget him</i>

268
00:37:59,903 --> 00:38:04,115
<i>And it's like forgetting
the joy of life</i>

269
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:09,662
<i>It's like a knife in the heart</i>

270
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:13,249
<i>Bleeding in pain</i>

271
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:29,015
May I sit here?

272
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,756
It's raining!

273
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:05,760
Let's have some fun!

274
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:07,637
It feels great!

275
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:10,265
Cover me too!

276
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:14,102
Come on!

277
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:29,868
What?

278
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:32,579
I'm all nervous.

279
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:34,122
Why?

280
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:36,499
Come on up.

281
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,835
No?

282
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:41,838
Okay.

283
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:47,719
Sure you don't wanna come up?

284
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:50,388
Positive?

285
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,307
Forget it.

286
00:39:57,854 --> 00:40:00,857
Come and get it.

287
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:16,998
It won't dry out tonight.
You'll have to stay.

288
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:21,836
I'll take it to the cleaners
for you tomorrow.

289
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:23,212
Okay?

290
00:40:25,882 --> 00:40:28,217
Hey, I'm talking to you.

291
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:31,763
Why are you ignoring me?

292
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:36,517
Open the door!

293
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:46,527
Looks nice.
Still fits you well.

294
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:49,530
Whose is this?

295
00:40:51,324 --> 00:40:52,784
Why all the questions?

296
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:55,203
Are <i>we</i> that close?

297
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,038
Better be careful!

298
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:04,545
What are you doing?

299
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:13,930
Help!

300
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:17,475
Hey!

301
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,061
What do you want from me?

302
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:38,413
What are you doing?

303
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,917
I'm so happy!

304
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:45,420
Don't let me stop you.

305
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:09,861
Guess why I dyed my hair blond.

306
00:42:11,404 --> 00:42:12,447
I don't know.

307
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:16,868
To make myself unforgettable.

308
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,328
It's pretty special.

309
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:20,955
You're making fun of me.

310
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:23,791
I mean it.
You're very special.

311
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:26,753
- Someone told me that once before.
- Who?

312
00:42:30,423 --> 00:42:31,674
You!

313
00:42:31,841 --> 00:42:34,469
We were together for some time.

314
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:37,096
I had long hair then.

315
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:41,142
You called me "baby."

316
00:42:41,768 --> 00:42:43,019
Really?

317
00:42:45,438 --> 00:42:46,314
Yes.

318
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:51,444
But let's let bygones be bygones.

319
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:54,030
If you like me now, it's fine.

320
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:00,787
I didn't say that.

321
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:03,706
I just wanted some company.

322
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:06,209
Fine.

323
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:08,461
Just for the night.

324
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:12,548
Maybe you'll like me better tomorrow.

325
00:46:44,385 --> 00:46:45,594
No!

326
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,263
Get out!

327
00:46:48,681 --> 00:46:50,057
Get the hell out of here!

328
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:53,060
Get out or I'll clobber you!

329
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,405
Hello?

330
00:47:06,157 --> 00:47:08,576
What did you want to tell me?

331
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:11,746
You want to have kids?

332
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:14,415
Why are you telling me this?

333
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:19,837
You wanna get married?
Sure! I'll marry you.

334
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:23,716
Give me time
to send out invitations.

335
00:47:24,175 --> 00:47:25,926
You already did?

336
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,262
How come I'm the last to know?

337
00:47:28,429 --> 00:47:30,973
You're a sly one!

338
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:34,643
You sent me an invitation?

339
00:47:34,769 --> 00:47:36,520
Why?

340
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:46,530
I see.
Congratulations!

341
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:48,741
Who's the lucky girl?

342
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:51,410
Blondie?

343
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:54,872
What a perfect couple!

344
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:58,667
She wants me to be her bridesmaid?

345
00:47:59,752 --> 00:48:01,796
What should I wear?

346
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:03,297
Chinese style?

347
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:06,550
A lady-in-waiting?
How interesting!

348
00:48:07,218 --> 00:48:09,804
Sure! That's great!

349
00:48:10,638 --> 00:48:12,765
Where's Blondie now?

350
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:15,434
I want to call and congratulate her.

351
00:48:16,811 --> 00:48:18,771
Okay, thanks. Bye-bye.

352
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:26,529
Give me a dime.
You got a dime?

353
00:48:38,958 --> 00:48:40,918
Hello? Blondie?

354
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:44,255
I know you're there.
Stop pretending you're the machine.

355
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:47,341
You know what?
If you don't talk to me,

356
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:50,177
you'll regret it
the rest of your life!

357
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:52,179
You're marrying him?

358
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:54,181
I shouldn't have asked you
to pay his electricity bill.

359
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:55,933
Now you're getting married?

360
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:59,353
You filthy bitch!
He doesn't love you.

361
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:03,524
He just wants a son born
in the Year of the Pig-this year!

362
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:05,401
But it's already April!

363
00:49:05,526 --> 00:49:08,487
There's not enough time!
It'll be premature.

364
00:49:09,864 --> 00:49:10,948
I've got it!

365
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:14,368
You got pregnant by another guy
and told him it's his child.

366
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:18,497
I'm warning you: Next time I see you,
I'm gonna push you down the stairs!

367
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:19,957
You got that?

368
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:23,210
Hello? Hello?
I'm not finished yet!

369
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:24,837
Hello?

370
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,047
Gimme another dime!

371
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:38,851
That bitch!
She took the phone off the hook!

372
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:46,525
I don't want any!

373
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:50,779
Let me cry on your shoulder.

374
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,750
<i>The night's full of weirdos.</i>

375
00:50:03,751 --> 00:50:07,254
<i>This girl seems to turn up
wherever I go.</i>

376
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:12,009
I'm fine now.
I'll pay you back next time.

377
00:50:12,885 --> 00:50:14,553
<i>But every time we meet,
it's the same story.</i>

378
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:27,274
<i>I wish I could tell her some problems
can't be solved over the phone.</i>

379
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:29,610
<i>You meet the guy face to face
and talk it out,</i>

380
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:31,779
<i>or, if that fails,
you punch him in the nose.</i>

381
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,615
<i>Too bad I couldn't put it into words.</i>

382
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:39,036
<i>But she seemed to somehow
understand anyway,</i>

383
00:50:41,205 --> 00:50:42,915
I think you're right.

384
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:44,667
Let's go.

385
00:51:03,811 --> 00:51:05,479
Blondie, I know you're in there!

386
00:51:05,646 --> 00:51:08,357
Come out if you've got the guts!

387
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:11,235
I'm gonna burn this place down
on the count of three!

388
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:13,988
One... two... three!

389
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:16,657
I think we got the wrong floor.

390
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:20,828
Blondie, come on out!
I know you're in there!

391
00:51:20,995 --> 00:51:23,163
I'm gonna burn this place down
if you don't!

392
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:25,332
One... two... three!

393
00:51:27,585 --> 00:51:29,587
Let's try the next floor.

394
00:51:31,714 --> 00:51:33,382
Are those gray hairs real?

395
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:35,384
At my age? Of course they are!

396
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:39,054
Looks like a faded blond dye job to me!
How are you related to Blondie?

397
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:40,514
I don't know any Blondie.

398
00:51:40,681 --> 00:51:42,600
Her real name's Situ Hui Ling.
Ring a bell?

399
00:51:42,725 --> 00:51:44,518
Never heard of her.

400
00:51:44,685 --> 00:51:45,811
Is she your chick?

401
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:48,647
Leave me alone, you loony!

402
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:50,566
I'm sure they've got a thing together.

403
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:52,359
Follow him!

404
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:54,612
Do you have a daughter
named Blondie?

405
00:51:54,737 --> 00:51:58,490
Or Situ Hui Ling? You look a lot alike.
Have you forgotten?

406
00:51:58,616 --> 00:52:00,326
- Think hard.
- I don't know her.

407
00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:02,620
<i>We searched high and low all night.</i>

408
00:52:02,745 --> 00:52:06,415
<i>After a while, I started to wonder
if she even knew where Blondie lived</i>

409
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,500
I'm tired of this game.

410
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:12,796
Why is everyone covering for you?
Where the hell are you?

411
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:14,923
I'm a nice person.
Why doesn't anyone help me?

412
00:52:15,049 --> 00:52:16,884
You're a slut,
and everyone helps you!

413
00:52:17,051 --> 00:52:19,553
It's not fair.
What kind of world is this?

414
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,722
I don't wanna play this game anymore.

415
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:24,767
You must be sleeping with everyone.
You must have slept with her too.

416
00:52:24,892 --> 00:52:27,895
I bet you have,
but you won't admit it. Right?

417
00:52:28,062 --> 00:52:31,106
What a crazy world.
How am I gonna find you?

418
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:33,984
Bitch! You've got
the whole world on your side.

419
00:52:45,746 --> 00:52:47,414
Blondie!

420
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:51,377
You slut! How dare you show your face!
You're finished!

421
00:52:51,502 --> 00:52:56,006
Bitch! Slut! Tramp!

422
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:59,009
I'll mop you to death!

423
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:00,678
Bitch!

424
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:06,475
How can you be so cruel!

425
00:53:12,773 --> 00:53:15,943
Hey, get your face out of the food
and watch the door!

426
00:53:16,068 --> 00:53:17,695
Blondie could walk in any minute.

427
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:20,572
She used to come here
for dim sum with her pop.

428
00:53:23,701 --> 00:53:27,037
How do you spell "inadequate"?

429
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:34,586
Never mind.
I'll just spell it like this.

430
00:53:37,381 --> 00:53:38,465
Listen to this.

431
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:42,970
"I, Situ Hui Ling, aka Blondie,
am ugly and inadequate.

432
00:53:43,137 --> 00:53:46,181
I hereby return Mr. Johnny Kwong
to his rightful girlfriend, Charlie Young.

433
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:48,308
I will have no more relationship with him.

434
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:51,186
This will serve as proof.
Our signatures are binding unto death."

435
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:53,814
This is great, right?

436
00:53:54,982 --> 00:53:57,401
I'll make Blondie sign this today.

437
00:53:57,526 --> 00:54:00,070
I gotta get her fingerprints
and ID number.

438
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:03,657
Her old man can serve as witness.
I'll get a picture of them together.

439
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:04,533
Blondie!

440
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:07,202
- Your name is Blondie too?
- Shut up!

441
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:08,954
I'll fucking chop you to pieces!

442
00:54:10,289 --> 00:54:12,082
This is Blondie!

443
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:13,959
Your name is Blondie too?

444
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:15,627
What if it is?

445
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:20,424
Is your name really Blondie?

446
00:54:20,549 --> 00:54:21,633
What of it?

447
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:12,309
<i>They say women are made of water.</i>

448
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:14,895
<i>So are some men.</i>

449
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:18,774
<i>Most people fall in love
for the first time as teenagers.</i>

450
00:55:19,107 --> 00:55:21,068
<i>I guess I'm a late bloomer.</i>

451
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:23,862
<i>Maybe I'm too picky,</i>

452
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:26,198
<i>On May 30, 1995,</i>

453
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:28,534
<i>I finally fell in love
for the first time.</i>

454
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:32,329
<i>It was raining that night.</i>

455
00:55:32,788 --> 00:55:37,459
<i>When I looked at her,
I suddenly felt like I was a store.</i>

456
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:39,878
<i>And she was me.</i>

457
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:43,882
<i>Without any warning,
she suddenly enters the store.</i>

458
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:46,218
<i>I don't know how long she'll stay,</i>

459
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:48,762
<i>The longer the better, of course.</i>

460
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:42,376
You never wash
your feet or socks or hair.

461
00:57:43,377 --> 00:57:45,295
You stink all over.

462
00:57:47,047 --> 00:57:50,217
When did you dye your hair blond?

463
00:57:53,804 --> 00:57:56,223
<i>They say love can change a man.</i>

464
00:57:56,473 --> 00:58:00,018
<i>I started to find myself
more handsome and charming.</i>

465
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:03,689
<i>And suddenly I discovered
I was turning blond</i>

466
00:58:03,939 --> 00:58:06,358
<i>Maybe because my mom was Russian.</i>

467
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:09,820
<i>A lot of people don't understand
when my father speaks Taiwanese.</i>

468
00:58:09,945 --> 00:58:11,738
<i>And rightly so.</i>

469
00:58:11,863 --> 00:58:14,658
<i>It's actually Taiwanese
with the infamous Russian accent.</i>

470
00:58:15,826 --> 00:58:18,412
Hello?
Chungking Mansions Hotel.

471
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:20,163
Who's this?

472
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:21,164
Blondie!

473
00:58:37,681 --> 00:58:40,100
<i>On June 22, 1995,</i>

474
00:58:40,475 --> 00:58:44,021
<i>the Italian team Sampdoria
came to play in Hong Kong.</i>

475
00:58:44,271 --> 00:58:46,148
<i>I went to the game with Charlie.</i>

476
00:58:46,565 --> 00:58:48,233
<i>She wanted to see Ruud Gullit.</i>

477
00:58:49,818 --> 00:58:52,154
<i>She was ecstatic that night.</i>

478
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:55,949
<i>She insisted on staying after the game.</i>

479
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:58,660
This is no fun!

480
00:58:59,745 --> 00:59:01,955
What's the point in playing them?

481
00:59:02,456 --> 00:59:06,626
They're all blond and superior.
Our players are no match.

482
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:11,882
Did they really expect a miracle?
Fools!

483
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:17,804
You know why I came?

484
00:59:19,765 --> 00:59:23,769
I was the one hoping for a miracle.

485
00:59:23,894 --> 00:59:27,230
Johnny is a huge fan of Gullit.

486
00:59:27,355 --> 00:59:29,149
I thought I might see him here.

487
00:59:29,316 --> 00:59:32,694
But how could he come?
He's getting married tomorrow.

488
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:37,783
You know why I was yelling
and waving like crazy earlier?

489
00:59:37,908 --> 00:59:41,036
I was hoping he'd see me on TV.

490
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:50,837
He promised me he'd come!

491
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:53,131
So why didn't he?

492
00:59:55,342 --> 00:59:57,844
<i>I realized that she still missed Johnny,</i>

493
00:59:58,011 --> 01:00:00,013
<i>It made me feel bad</i>

494
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:02,474
<i>But I'm an optimist.</i>

495
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:06,478
<i>I've heard people say
everything has its expiration date.</i>

496
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:09,815
<i>I wasn't sure this would apply
to her and Johnny,</i>

497
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:12,818
<i>but I thought it might soon.</i>

498
01:00:26,957 --> 01:00:29,543
<i>I guess I might have been
a little too optimistic.</i>

499
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:33,004
<i>A few days later,
I asked her to go to a second match.</i>

500
01:00:34,214 --> 01:00:36,091
<i>She didn't show up.</i>

501
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:40,887
<i>I thought what she had
with Johnny would expire soon.</i>

502
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:42,889
<i>But as it turned out,</i>

503
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:45,517
<i>my expiration date came up first.</i>

504
01:00:49,354 --> 01:00:51,982
<i>I got there early
and stayed till everyone was gone.</i>

505
01:00:52,107 --> 01:00:54,317
<i>As the lights of the stadium went dark,</i>

506
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:56,194
<i>I realized she wasn't gonna show</i>

507
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:58,989
<i>I was heartbroken.
This couldn't be.</i>

508
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:09,666
<i>People say breaking up hurts.</i>

509
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:12,043
<i>That wasn't true for me.</i>

510
01:01:14,045 --> 01:01:15,714
<i>But something strange did happen.</i>

511
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:19,426
<i>After that day, my blond hair
suddenly disappeared</i>

512
01:01:19,593 --> 01:01:21,761
<i>Just like my first love.</i>

513
01:01:22,762 --> 01:01:26,683
<i>I also began to realize my past behavior
had been very irresponsible.</i>

514
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:29,686
<i>I shouldn't have taken over
other people's shops,</i>

515
01:01:29,811 --> 01:01:32,272
<i>coming and going as I pleased</i>

516
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:36,026
<i>Every shop has its own feelings.</i>

517
01:01:36,776 --> 01:01:39,362
<i>This realization
had a profound effect on me.</i>

518
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:42,449
<i>It prompted me to change my ways.</i>

519
01:01:57,714 --> 01:01:59,174
Welcome.

520
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:01,509
One person.

521
01:02:02,636 --> 01:02:07,140
Look for our <i>new</i> menu next time.

522
01:02:07,265 --> 01:02:09,017
Am I making you stay overtime?

523
01:02:11,019 --> 01:02:13,104
Get a glass for yourself.
Be my guest.

524
01:02:23,323 --> 01:02:24,449
How's business?

525
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:40,715
What's it cost
to open a place like this?

526
01:02:57,691 --> 01:02:59,359
Good evening.

527
01:03:01,403 --> 01:03:03,363
You have money?

528
01:03:04,364 --> 01:03:07,784
I was just wondering
what it costs to open a place like this.

529
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:09,953
Do you have a million?

530
01:03:10,078 --> 01:03:12,956
<i>I had never thought
about going into business before.</i>

531
01:03:13,373 --> 01:03:16,543
<i>When you live in a suitcase,
you don't need a place of your own.</i>

532
01:03:17,377 --> 01:03:19,379
<i>But things had changed</i>

533
01:03:19,504 --> 01:03:21,423
<i>I had to start planning
for the future.</i>

534
01:03:22,882 --> 01:03:25,844
<i>That night,
I had a nice chat with the manager.</i>

535
01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:29,389
<i>He even offered a helping hand</i>

536
01:03:30,432 --> 01:03:32,600
<i>should I ever open my own shop.</i>

537
01:03:33,727 --> 01:03:36,021
- Another beer?
- Sure, one more.

538
01:03:54,372 --> 01:03:56,750
How much money do you have?

539
01:04:12,015 --> 01:04:14,601
<i>I stayed away from that bar
for some time,</i>

540
01:04:16,144 --> 01:04:18,813
<i>partly because I didn't want
to hear song number 1818.</i>

541
01:04:20,106 --> 01:04:23,109
<i>But there are some things
you can't escape.</i>

542
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:27,822
<i>I've never returned
to that restaurant since that night.</i>

543
01:05:00,397 --> 01:05:04,943
<i>Wishing you good fortune
and long life to reach the heavens</i>

544
01:05:05,193 --> 01:05:09,197
<i>Wishing you a happy birthday</i>

545
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:13,993
<i>May this day be joyous
for you every year</i>

546
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:18,498
<i>Best wishes to you</i>

547
01:05:56,703 --> 01:06:00,123
<i>How are you, my boy?</i>

548
01:06:02,917 --> 01:06:05,378
<i>Your dad's fine.
Don't worry about me.</i>

549
01:06:09,549 --> 01:06:11,384
<i>Soon it'll be your birthday,</i>

550
01:06:12,552 --> 01:06:14,929
<i>I'm sorry I can't come home.</i>

551
01:06:16,264 --> 01:06:19,184
<i>Is your mother feeling better?</i>

552
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:24,898
<i>Is your sister behaving herself?</i>

553
01:06:31,362 --> 01:06:33,907
<i>Sato-san is a real family man.</i>

554
01:06:35,158 --> 01:06:39,245
<i>He was a film director
before he opened this place.</i>

555
01:06:40,163 --> 01:06:45,627
<i>So he always communicates
with his family by making a videotape.</i>

556
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:51,424
<i>I'm sure his son must be very happy
to receive his videotapes.</i>

557
01:06:53,051 --> 01:06:55,428
<i>Sometimes I want
to try the same thing.</i>

558
01:06:55,595 --> 01:06:58,932
<i>But I don't know
who I'd send my tapes to.</i>

559
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:02,644
<i>I don't want to end up
sending them to myself</i>

560
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:21,120
<i>You whom I hold in my heart</i>

561
01:07:23,581 --> 01:07:31,256
<i>Why did you leave my side</i>

562
01:07:34,092 --> 01:07:37,804
<i>Because of you</i>

563
01:07:38,638 --> 01:07:42,850
<i>I'm sad all the time</i>

564
01:07:43,643 --> 01:07:48,565
<i>I miss you with all my heart</i>

565
01:07:53,653 --> 01:07:57,198
<i>My beloved</i>

566
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:02,078
<i>Come back to me</i>

567
01:08:03,746 --> 01:08:09,168
<i>Hurry back to my side</i>

568
01:08:10,461 --> 01:08:12,839
<i>Though I'm not like Sato-san,</i>

569
01:08:12,964 --> 01:08:16,050
<i>I can feel the same happiness as his son
on receiving his father's tape.</i>

570
01:09:10,855 --> 01:09:13,399
Get out of here!

571
01:09:32,293 --> 01:09:35,838
I've got nothing to say.
I want to go to sleep.

572
01:09:43,012 --> 01:09:46,766
Are you crazy?

573
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:49,560
Get out of here!

574
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:01,948
Go away!

575
01:10:50,413 --> 01:10:55,710
<i>Later that night, I discovered Dad
secretly watching the tape.</i>

576
01:10:56,669 --> 01:10:58,504
<i>He really enjoyed it.</i>

577
01:10:59,338 --> 01:11:01,799
<i>I'm usually very bad at details,</i>

578
01:11:02,383 --> 01:11:06,679
<i>but I remember very well
that it was his 60th birthday,</i>

579
01:11:07,847 --> 01:11:11,934
<i>He kept laughing as he watched it.
Who knows what he found so funny,</i>

580
01:11:12,059 --> 01:11:14,270
<i>But I know he was happy,</i>

581
01:11:16,147 --> 01:11:18,191
Stupid kid!

582
01:11:42,632 --> 01:11:44,634
<i>When you've worked
with someone for a long time,</i>

583
01:11:44,759 --> 01:11:47,887
<i>he can have a certain effect on you.</i>

584
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:51,098
<i>I knew that fragrance very well.</i>

585
01:11:51,891 --> 01:11:55,311
<i>I just wasn't used
to smelling it on another woman.</i>

586
01:12:01,526 --> 01:12:04,111
This suit fits me well.

587
01:12:04,529 --> 01:12:06,656
But I think it's shrunk a little.

588
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:14,997
I never liked this fragrance
all that much.

589
01:12:17,208 --> 01:12:19,919
This afternoon
I smelled it on another woman.

590
01:12:21,879 --> 01:12:23,881
She wants to see you very much.

591
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:26,425
I set up a meeting for you with her.

592
01:12:28,094 --> 01:12:29,762
You're not gonna go, right?

593
01:12:34,225 --> 01:12:37,436
You should go.
That way you could clear things up.

594
01:12:40,731 --> 01:12:43,943
Then again,
it's even better if you don't go.

595
01:12:49,866 --> 01:12:51,701
I know you'll go.

596
01:12:53,244 --> 01:12:54,954
You can have this back.

597
01:13:48,007 --> 01:13:50,092
I want...

598
01:13:51,302 --> 01:13:52,762
a bag of chips.

599
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:55,848
The yellow ones, not the red.

600
01:14:33,386 --> 01:14:36,597
<i>They sat there together
for a long time that day,</i>

601
01:14:36,931 --> 01:14:39,058
<i>I wonder what they said
to each other.</i>

602
01:14:39,892 --> 01:14:42,103
<i>It rained the whole time.</i>

603
01:14:42,228 --> 01:14:43,729
<i>I started to think,</i>

604
01:14:43,896 --> 01:14:46,732
<i>"It's raining so hard
How will I get home by myself?"</i>

605
01:15:03,249 --> 01:15:05,292
<i>Just when I really needed a raincoat,</i>

606
01:15:06,419 --> 01:15:08,254
<i>he returned to my side.</i>

607
01:15:12,091 --> 01:15:14,135
<i>It would be so great</i>

608
01:15:15,052 --> 01:15:16,679
<i>if it could rain forever.</i>

609
01:15:21,434 --> 01:15:22,977
I'm not coming up.

610
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:29,608
Then why'd you walk me home?

611
01:15:31,402 --> 01:15:34,113
You should have let me
come back alone!

612
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:36,365
I was thinking of coming back
by myself anyway.

613
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:39,660
Why did you do that?
Think it'd be easier on me this way?

614
01:15:40,327 --> 01:15:41,746
You're crazy!

615
01:15:41,871 --> 01:15:45,124
Fuck off!
I never want to see you again!

616
01:15:47,835 --> 01:15:49,670
I thought we had agreed on this.

617
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:52,548
Not me!
I never agreed to anything!

618
01:15:52,673 --> 01:15:56,802
I asked you not to see her, but you did.
Now what do you want from me?

619
01:15:57,970 --> 01:16:00,306
You think I'm a fool?

620
01:16:00,431 --> 01:16:02,475
Get lost!

621
01:16:04,018 --> 01:16:06,771
Liar!

622
01:16:12,485 --> 01:16:13,444
Give me your arm.

623
01:16:19,325 --> 01:16:20,993
Why'd you do that?

624
01:16:24,163 --> 01:16:26,165
Can't I leave you a memento?

625
01:16:26,832 --> 01:16:30,377
You might forget my face,
but not my bite.

626
01:16:34,048 --> 01:16:38,177
But my face is easy to remember.
I have a mole.

627
01:16:38,344 --> 01:16:43,516
If a woman with a mole on her face
comes up to you on the street,

628
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:48,521
it could be me.

629
01:16:52,399 --> 01:16:54,527
You won't remember me.

630
01:16:58,489 --> 01:16:59,824
Yes, I will.

631
01:17:29,103 --> 01:17:30,855
<i>Do I remember her?</i>

632
01:17:31,105 --> 01:17:33,315
<i>Actually it's not that important.</i>

633
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:34,859
<i>For her,</i>

634
01:17:35,317 --> 01:17:37,862
<i>I'm just a stopover
on the journey of her life.</i>

635
01:17:37,987 --> 01:17:40,447
<i>I hope she reaches
her destination soon</i>

636
01:17:40,573 --> 01:17:43,200
<i>and finds a man who really loves her.</i>

637
01:17:43,993 --> 01:17:46,537
<i>We all need a partner.</i>

638
01:17:47,872 --> 01:17:50,749
<i>When will I find mine?</i>

639
01:17:57,965 --> 01:18:00,134
Are we still partners?

640
01:18:22,031 --> 01:18:24,700
<i>I didn't know
how to answer that question.</i>

641
01:18:25,159 --> 01:18:28,287
<i>I had come to look at partners
from a new angle.</i>

642
01:18:29,121 --> 01:18:31,957
<i>As a business partner,
she was perfect.</i>

643
01:18:32,791 --> 01:18:36,045
<i>But she wasn't the kind of partner
you could spend your life with.</i>

644
01:18:37,963 --> 01:18:40,257
I'd like to terminate
our business relationship.

645
01:18:54,063 --> 01:18:55,814
Do me one last favor, will you?

646
01:19:05,824 --> 01:19:07,826
<i>I don't know why I agreed</i>

647
01:19:10,829 --> 01:19:12,748
<i>Maybe because
it was the last time.</i>

648
01:19:35,521 --> 01:19:38,107
I want to place
an advertisement for my friend.

649
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:43,362
On the front page.

650
01:23:11,862 --> 01:23:13,530
<i>The best thing about my profession</i>

651
01:23:13,655 --> 01:23:16,116
<i>is there's no need
to make any decisions.</i>

652
01:23:16,241 --> 01:23:18,243
<i>Who's to die, when, where-</i>

653
01:23:18,410 --> 01:23:20,412
<i>it's all been planned by others.</i>

654
01:23:21,663 --> 01:23:23,457
<i>I'm a lazy person.</i>

655
01:23:24,249 --> 01:23:26,877
<i>I like people to arrange things for me.</i>

656
01:23:27,252 --> 01:23:29,213
<i>It's been a bit different lately</i>

657
01:23:29,755 --> 01:23:31,924
<i>I want to change this habit.</i>

658
01:23:32,758 --> 01:23:35,010
<i>I don't know
if it's a good decision or not,</i>

659
01:23:35,594 --> 01:23:38,472
<i>but at least it's mine.</i>

660
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:31,733
<i>Old people say taking someone's picture
shortens that person's life.</i>

661
01:24:31,984 --> 01:24:34,069
<i>I'm not sure it's true.</i>

662
01:24:35,529 --> 01:24:37,948
<i>One evening, Dad wasn't feeling well.</i>

663
01:24:38,407 --> 01:24:40,158
<i>I took him to the hospital.</i>

664
01:24:41,868 --> 01:24:44,955
<i>He passed away a while later.</i>

665
01:24:47,416 --> 01:24:52,087
<i>All these years, I've always felt
like a little boy because of him.</i>

666
01:24:53,338 --> 01:24:56,800
<i>He was someone I could always turn to,
someone to solve all my problems.</i>

667
01:24:58,427 --> 01:25:01,763
<i>Packing up his stuff that evening,</i>

668
01:25:02,180 --> 01:25:04,433
<i>I felt like a grown-up
for the first time.</i>

669
01:25:07,936 --> 01:25:09,938
<i>But I don't wanna be a grown-up.</i>

670
01:25:12,065 --> 01:25:14,610
<i>I sure wish Dad
could always be with me!</i>

671
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:33,211
<i>When I left the hotel,
the videotape was all I took with me.</i>

672
01:25:34,379 --> 01:25:36,590
<i>I watched it over and over
before I left.</i>

673
01:27:22,362 --> 01:27:25,574
<i>Watching Dad cook in the kitchen,
I feel very happy,</i>

674
01:27:26,992 --> 01:27:30,162
<i>Though I know
I'll never taste his steaks again,</i>

675
01:27:31,663 --> 01:27:34,583
<i>I'll never forget how they tasted</i>

676
01:27:40,839 --> 01:27:43,467
<i>You again?
I'll be damned!</i>

677
01:27:43,592 --> 01:27:45,510
<i>Stop pulling my hair!
You promised!</i>

678
01:27:45,677 --> 01:27:48,263
You should know not to touch it.

679
01:27:48,388 --> 01:27:50,515
I'd love to be your customer.

680
01:27:50,682 --> 01:27:52,601
Did I ever say no?

681
01:27:53,059 --> 01:27:54,853
Did I?

682
01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:58,523
Look at me! How do I look?
Don't touch me!

683
01:27:58,690 --> 01:28:00,275
My wife has gone to China.

684
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:03,820
I have some business to take care of.

685
01:28:03,945 --> 01:28:06,698
Give me three hours.
I promise I'll be back on time.

686
01:28:06,823 --> 01:28:09,284
Three hours, okay?
Three hours.

687
01:28:11,286 --> 01:28:12,829
Two hours?

688
01:28:12,954 --> 01:28:15,707
It's a deal.
Two hours and I'll be back.

689
01:28:16,708 --> 01:28:19,211
Come on, trust me.
We're old friends now, aren't we?

690
01:28:19,377 --> 01:28:22,714
It's a small world. We keep running
into each other. <i>Two</i> hours.

691
01:28:22,839 --> 01:28:24,758
Trust me, please!

692
01:28:24,883 --> 01:28:27,719
You have my word.
We're brothers, right?

693
01:28:31,223 --> 01:28:33,183
<i>You want it written in blood?</i>

694
01:28:34,059 --> 01:28:35,644
<i>You gotta be kidding!</i>

695
01:28:36,728 --> 01:28:37,979
<i>That's my bone!</i>

696
01:28:38,855 --> 01:28:40,106
<i>Just one, okay?</i>

697
01:28:40,357 --> 01:28:44,069
<i>If you cut them all off,
I won't be able to go out in public!</i>

698
01:28:48,114 --> 01:28:50,742
Could I have some change, please?

699
01:28:58,667 --> 01:28:59,584
Thanks.

700
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:06,007
I'm downstairs already.

701
01:29:06,758 --> 01:29:08,552
Hurry and come down.

702
01:29:08,802 --> 01:29:09,928
Bye-bye.

703
01:29:18,603 --> 01:29:20,939
<i>It must have just been bad luck.</i>

704
01:29:21,356 --> 01:29:25,151
<i>Soon after Dad died,
Sato-san returned to Japan.</i>

705
01:29:26,570 --> 01:29:28,697
<i>Since I didn't have much in savings,</i>

706
01:29:28,822 --> 01:29:30,782
<i>I could only do what I'm best at..</i>

707
01:29:30,907 --> 01:29:32,576
<i>Being my own boss.</i>

708
01:29:33,118 --> 01:29:35,704
<i>But I was very cautious this time.</i>

709
01:29:35,829 --> 01:29:38,498
<i>I tried to pick the stronger shops.</i>

710
01:29:38,623 --> 01:29:41,376
<i>Ones that wouldn't get hurt easily</i>

711
01:29:41,626 --> 01:29:44,629
<i>Like this one.
Its equipment was mostly steel.</i>

712
01:29:44,796 --> 01:29:46,715
<i>It saves a lot of trouble.</i>

713
01:29:47,507 --> 01:29:49,718
<i>At times I'd run into acquaintances.</i>

714
01:29:49,968 --> 01:29:52,637
<i>Some hadn't changed much.</i>

715
01:29:53,597 --> 01:29:55,724
<i>Others I hardly recognized</i>

716
01:29:56,850 --> 01:29:59,269
<i>I was always glad when I saw them,</i>

717
01:29:59,519 --> 01:30:02,606
<i>even though
they might not remember me.</i>

718
01:30:03,815 --> 01:30:06,735
<i>Of course, there were exceptions.</i>

719
01:30:08,069 --> 01:30:10,405
<i>On August 29, 1995,</i>

720
01:30:10,822 --> 01:30:12,949
<i>I ran into my first love again.</i>

721
01:30:13,950 --> 01:30:15,994
<i>But she seemed to have forgotten me.</i>

722
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:20,874
<i>I guess I'd gotten too handsome.</i>

723
01:30:29,174 --> 01:30:31,676
- How come you're so late?
- I was busy.

724
01:30:31,843 --> 01:30:32,969
What's he doing?

725
01:30:33,428 --> 01:30:34,846
Who knows?

726
01:30:52,364 --> 01:30:55,325
<i>It was cold that evening.</i>

727
01:30:56,326 --> 01:30:59,579
<i>I hadn't expected winter
to come so soon.</i>

728
01:31:05,543 --> 01:31:08,171
<i>I'm less and less used
to this kind of weather.</i>

729
01:31:09,965 --> 01:31:13,093
<i>Winter seems so long this year.</i>

730
01:31:14,386 --> 01:31:16,638
<i>Though I eat a lot every day,</i>

731
01:31:18,390 --> 01:31:19,975
<i>I still feel cold</i>

732
01:31:22,769 --> 01:31:26,064
<i>I've gotten used to life
without a partner.</i>

733
01:31:27,857 --> 01:31:31,319
<i>Though I work with others at times,</i>

734
01:31:31,444 --> 01:31:34,072
<i>I don't usually have fixed partners.</i>

735
01:31:35,865 --> 01:31:37,993
<i>I've grown more cautious.</i>

736
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:43,081
<i>I won't make their beds anymore,
for example.</i>

737
01:31:43,581 --> 01:31:46,251
<i>I don't inspect their trash,</i>

738
01:31:48,086 --> 01:31:50,255
<i>'cause I believe
even more strongly now</i>

739
01:31:50,380 --> 01:31:53,675
<i>that the best partners
don't get emotionally involved</i>

740
01:32:52,734 --> 01:32:55,862
<i>You rub elbows
with a lot of people everyday,</i>

741
01:32:56,196 --> 01:32:59,991
<i>Some strangers might become
your friends or even confidants.</i>

742
01:33:00,408 --> 01:33:03,661
<i>So I never turn my back
on a chance to rub elbows.</i>

743
01:33:04,621 --> 01:33:06,748
<i>Sometimes I rub till I bleed</i>

744
01:33:07,082 --> 01:33:09,667
<i>No big deal,
as long as I'm happy,</i>

745
01:33:14,923 --> 01:33:18,134
<i>That night,
I ran into that woman again.</i>

746
01:33:18,802 --> 01:33:21,846
<i>I knew very well we'd never be
friends or confidants.</i>

747
01:33:22,013 --> 01:33:25,183
<i>We'd had too many chances
to rub elbows in the past.</i>

748
01:33:25,683 --> 01:33:28,686
<i>We had rubbed elbows
till our clothes tore, but still no sparks.</i>

749
01:33:29,938 --> 01:33:32,190
<i>Maybe it was the weather,</i>

750
01:33:32,482 --> 01:33:35,944
<i>but that evening I felt a spark.</i>

751
01:34:12,230 --> 01:34:15,567
<i>As I was leaving,
I asked if he'd give me a ride home.</i>

752
01:34:18,069 --> 01:34:20,905
<i>I hadn't ridden
on a motorcycle in a long time.</i>

753
01:34:21,406 --> 01:34:24,409
<i>Actually I hadn't been
that close to a man for a while.</i>

754
01:34:26,452 --> 01:34:28,663
<i>The road wasn't that long,</i>

755
01:34:28,997 --> 01:34:30,999
<i>and I knew I'd be getting off soon.</i>

756
01:34:32,333 --> 01:34:35,753
<i>But at that moment
I felt such warmth.</i>

757
01:36:13,685 --> 01:36:16,688
