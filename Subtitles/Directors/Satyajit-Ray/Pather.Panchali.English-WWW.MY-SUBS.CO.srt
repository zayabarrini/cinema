00:02:52,841 --> 00:02:54,342
Who's there?

23
00:02:55,176 --> 00:02:56,970
Look at that!

24
00:02:58,346 --> 00:02:59,764
Hey!

25
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,394
That girl won't leave
any fruit on the trees!

26
00:05:33,376 --> 00:05:35,545
That orchard wasn't free.

27
00:05:36,504 --> 00:05:39,424
We paid good money for it.

28
00:05:39,549 --> 00:05:41,092
I've said all along,

29
00:05:41,217 --> 00:05:44,679
"If we want any fruit left,
we'll have to fence it in."

30
00:05:45,346 --> 00:05:49,475
So many thieves in this village!
<i>- What happened?</i>

31
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,728
It's Harihar's little brat!

32
00:05:53,354 --> 00:05:56,399
She doesn't leave
a single piece of fruit!

33
00:05:56,691 --> 00:05:59,986
The moment I turn my back,
she steals it!

34
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:03,072
- What did she take?
- I saw her take a guava.

35
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:06,492
Who knows what else?
I can't watch every tree!

36
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:10,121
- Why don't you talk to them?
- Talk to whom?

37
00:06:12,457 --> 00:06:14,709
Who would listen to me anyway?

38
00:06:15,043 --> 00:06:17,670
She's not <i>my</i> daughter.

39
00:06:17,795 --> 00:06:20,048
If her own mother doesn't care,

40
00:06:20,173 --> 00:06:22,592
what's it matter
what you or I say?

41
00:06:23,092 --> 00:06:25,386
Her mother will learn

42
00:06:25,511 --> 00:06:28,264
when the whole village
turns against her.

43
00:06:28,473 --> 00:06:30,516
It's just bad upbringing.

44
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:32,894
Children learn
what they're taught.

45
00:06:33,728 --> 00:06:35,897
Shall I carry that for you?

46
00:06:36,731 --> 00:06:38,274
No, thank you.

47
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:43,863
Why not let me help?
Can you manage?

48
00:06:43,988 --> 00:06:45,573
Yes.

49
00:07:38,543 --> 00:07:42,004
Oh, dear.
I forgot to save some for you.

50
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:43,798
Wait.

51
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:00,648
Durga.

52
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:08,531
Come along.

53
00:08:08,656 --> 00:08:12,160
She's doing no harm.
Let her stay.

54
00:08:12,535 --> 00:08:15,705
Why should she watch you eat?
Come here!

55
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,499
Go on. She's calling you.

56
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:21,169
Run along to your mother.

57
00:08:21,294 --> 00:08:23,171
Right now!

58
00:08:26,799 --> 00:08:30,511
What did you take
from Mrs. Mukherjee's orchard?

59
00:08:30,845 --> 00:08:32,305
Tell me.

60
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:34,432
What are you hiding?

61
00:08:35,016 --> 00:08:36,601
Show me!

62
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,362
Take it back.

63
00:08:49,697 --> 00:08:52,825
And sweep the yard
when you come back.

64
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:43,084
Auntie.

65
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:48,130
You realize the harm
you're doing the girl?

66
00:09:48,631 --> 00:09:51,342
- What do you mean?
- Need I tell you?

67
00:09:51,676 --> 00:09:53,386
Who eats that fruit?

68
00:09:53,761 --> 00:09:55,096
What fruit?

69
00:09:55,263 --> 00:09:57,932
The fruit Durga brings you.

70
00:09:58,683 --> 00:10:02,436
- She's just a child —
- But you're not.

71
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:06,983
Have you no sense?
Who do you think you are?

72
00:10:07,233 --> 00:10:10,778
Think you can do as you please
because we put you up?

73
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:16,951
I know you too well.
- What a lot of nonsense!

74
00:10:17,118 --> 00:10:18,953
Must I spell it out?

75
00:10:19,078 --> 00:10:21,622
Haven't you been stealing
from my kitchen?

76
00:10:22,081 --> 00:10:24,041
Oil, salt, chilies?

77
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,627
Shall I look in your box?

78
00:10:26,794 --> 00:10:28,337
Well?

79
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:30,256
Why don't you answer?

80
00:10:31,007 --> 00:10:33,968
You can't stay here
and carry on like this.

81
00:10:34,135 --> 00:10:36,429
Maybe you should go
somewhere else.

82
00:10:39,515 --> 00:10:41,142
I'm fed up.

83
00:10:41,309 --> 00:10:43,311
It's been eight years,

84
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:46,147
and I won't take any more.

85
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:50,693
You corrupt my daughter,
and I get the blame.

86
00:10:50,818 --> 00:10:53,362
I won't allow it.

87
00:11:30,024 --> 00:11:32,818
I don't need this bother
at my age.

88
00:11:36,364 --> 00:11:37,823
Out of the way!

89
00:11:38,366 --> 00:11:40,868
Auntie, where are you going?

90
00:12:03,391 --> 00:12:04,600
Auntie!

91
00:12:11,357 --> 00:12:13,776
Durga, come here.

92
00:12:18,406 --> 00:12:19,907
Let go!

93
00:12:23,035 --> 00:12:25,079
Durga, come here!

94
00:12:41,804 --> 00:12:43,764
Did you give it back?

95
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:48,269
What else did I tell you to do?

96
00:14:42,424 --> 00:14:45,135
Where have you been,
Auntie Indir?

97
00:14:45,261 --> 00:14:47,221
At Raju's.

98
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:52,351
This morning Shaila told me
about Hari's new son.

99
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:56,897
I was on my way
when this child came to get me.

100
00:14:57,231 --> 00:14:59,275
We met on the road.

101
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:03,404
Go in and see
your beautiful little nephew.

102
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:06,907
Where's the little darling?

103
00:15:13,998 --> 00:15:16,917
Auntie, you're back at last.

104
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:29,221
Take the blanket off

105
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:31,265
so I can have a good look.

106
00:15:36,979 --> 00:15:38,689
The little darling!

107
00:15:39,607 --> 00:15:42,026
What a little darling!

108
00:15:50,618 --> 00:15:53,370
<i>Bulbuls have eaten the rice</i>

109
00:15:53,537 --> 00:15:56,123
<i>How shall I pay the tax?</i>

110
00:15:56,582 --> 00:15:59,293
<i>Baby shall ride in a boat</i>

111
00:15:59,543 --> 00:16:02,379
<i>And wear red shoes</i>

112
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,424
<i>Who dares say his skin is dark?</i>

113
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:08,302
Ten...

114
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:12,181
11, 12...

115
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,683
13...

116
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:17,436
<i>Sleep, golden one</i>

117
00:16:18,562 --> 00:16:21,649
<i>I'll send for the goldsmith</i>

118
00:16:21,774 --> 00:16:24,318
<i>To make you a gold chain</i>

119
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:31,367
- What are you cooking?
- Can't you see?

120
00:16:33,369 --> 00:16:35,371
A sumptuous feast.
What else?

121
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:39,917
You should one day.
Or have you forgotten how?

122
00:16:40,334 --> 00:16:42,294
I have.

123
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:43,712
Too bad.

124
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:48,050
I thought we might celebrate
our son's first mouthful of rice.

125
00:16:50,803 --> 00:16:52,513
With what money?

126
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:56,141
I start work
for Mr. Ray next month.

127
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:57,768
Really?

128
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:02,147
I saw Nilmoni today.
He said Mr. Ray gave his word.

129
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:05,693
- Did you ask about the pay?
- I'm not worried.

130
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:08,862
Besides, I'm not going
to collect his rents forever.

131
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:12,658
He can't make me
his bonded slave.

132
00:17:12,908 --> 00:17:16,537
That money and the fees
for my services as a priest

133
00:17:16,704 --> 00:17:19,832
will keep the family
going for now.

134
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:23,168
Besides, there are always
good times and bad.

135
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:26,338
Things are going well.

136
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,135
The boy was born in January,
and you found work in the spring.

137
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:34,972
That's why
we should spend a little

138
00:17:35,556 --> 00:17:37,808
to celebrate in style

139
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:40,185
and save face
with the neighbors.

140
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:45,649
Besides,
they'll all praise your cooking.

141
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:48,026
That's something, isn't it?

142
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:53,240
Will he pay regularly?

143
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:56,243
Why wouldn't he?
Ray's a good man.

144
00:17:57,286 --> 00:18:01,498
Who's to say
who's good and who's not?

145
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,917
People are always cheating you.

146
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:05,836
Like when?

147
00:18:05,961 --> 00:18:08,797
Didn't they steal the orchard
from right under our noses?

148
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:13,802
They said my brother owed them
money when he was alive.

149
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:16,305
The orchard satisfied that debt.

150
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:19,933
We'd have no worries
if we still had that orchard.

151
00:18:20,893 --> 00:18:23,270
Mangoes, rose apples, coconuts.

152
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:25,981
They pick sackfuls of our fruit,

153
00:18:26,607 --> 00:18:29,610
but if Durga takes
a single guava —

154
00:18:29,985 --> 00:18:32,070
Why worry about them?

155
00:18:32,237 --> 00:18:34,490
They're moneylenders,
and I'm a scholar.

156
00:18:34,615 --> 00:18:37,910
Who cares about that
in this godforsaken village?

157
00:18:38,035 --> 00:18:41,246
Listen to what I'm writing now:

158
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:44,166
new and original plays
and poems.

159
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,752
When word gets around,

160
00:18:46,877 --> 00:18:50,214
the traveling troupes
will come in droves.

161
00:18:50,339 --> 00:18:53,175
Where else can they get
new material?

162
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,761
Original plays don't grow on trees.

163
00:18:55,886 --> 00:18:59,223
Other writers just rehash

164
00:18:59,348 --> 00:19:01,266
the same old stuff.

165
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:03,101
If that's acceptable,

166
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:06,855
won't the original works
of Harihar Ray be as well?

167
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,774
Of course.

168
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:12,986
And as a scholar,
you'll be respected in the village.

169
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:15,113
What could be better?

170
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,452
You'll educate the boy...

171
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:25,415
give him his sacred thread,
teach him to worship the gods.

172
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:29,670
Durga will find a good husband.

173
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:34,716
Two good meals a day,
new clothes twice a year —

174
00:19:34,842 --> 00:19:36,969
what more could we want?

175
00:19:37,386 --> 00:19:39,680
We'll have all that and more.

176
00:19:39,847 --> 00:19:43,308
My ancestors were writers,
after all.

177
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:46,311
They left a legacy
that can't be ignored.

178
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,480
Just wait two years.

179
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:50,607
My debts will be paid off

180
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:52,985
and the house repaired,

181
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:56,488
and you won't have to fix
spinach and rice every day!

182
00:19:56,697 --> 00:19:58,448
How about that?

183
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:39,031
Apu! Aren't you up yet?

184
00:20:39,323 --> 00:20:42,743
Apu, aren't you going
to school?

185
00:20:43,118 --> 00:20:44,745
Wake up.

186
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:49,875
Durga.

187
00:20:51,585 --> 00:20:54,421
Durga, get Apu up.

188
00:20:54,588 --> 00:20:57,841
He has to get ready for school.
He's still snoring away.

189
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:03,764
Only half a pot, ma'am.

190
00:21:04,556 --> 00:21:07,100
Are you feeding the cow enough?

191
00:21:27,245 --> 00:21:29,247
Apu, get up.

192
00:22:53,415 --> 00:22:57,669
"Deep in the heart of Janasthan..."

193
00:23:05,802 --> 00:23:08,055
Hey!

194
00:23:08,513 --> 00:23:11,141
Why are you getting up again?

195
00:23:11,725 --> 00:23:15,062
How many more times
must you dampen your eraser?

196
00:23:16,063 --> 00:23:17,564
Sit down.

197
00:23:17,898 --> 00:23:22,027
"Deep in the heart of Janasthan..."

198
00:23:23,737 --> 00:23:26,615
Puti, what do you want?

199
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,575
One paisa of puffed rice.

200
00:23:28,742 --> 00:23:31,036
Hand over the money.

201
00:23:33,747 --> 00:23:38,502
"...stands the mighty
mountain Prasravan...

202
00:23:39,336 --> 00:23:42,172
its lofty summit...

203
00:23:46,218 --> 00:23:48,929
crowned
by ever drifting clouds...

204
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:58,980
that ceaseless gales...

205
00:24:06,571 --> 00:24:10,408
urge along
the pathways of the sky..."

206
00:24:13,912 --> 00:24:15,914
How are you, Prasanna?

207
00:24:16,123 --> 00:24:19,167
Welcome, Mr. Majumdar!

208
00:24:19,501 --> 00:24:22,170
Dear me!
It's a trap to kill people!

209
00:24:25,507 --> 00:24:28,802
- Hello there.
- How's everything?

210
00:24:28,969 --> 00:24:30,428
Just fine.

211
00:24:31,138 --> 00:24:32,973
Come in, come in.

212
00:24:33,306 --> 00:24:35,809
You've spread quite a net, eh?

213
00:24:35,934 --> 00:24:38,812
How many little fish
have you caught now?

214
00:24:39,146 --> 00:24:41,231
There were eight.

215
00:24:41,356 --> 00:24:43,191
A new boy just arrived.

216
00:24:43,316 --> 00:24:46,486
The proverbial nine jewels!

217
00:24:48,822 --> 00:24:50,907
Apu, what are you smiling about?

218
00:24:51,158 --> 00:24:53,076
Is this a theater?

219
00:24:53,493 --> 00:24:56,997
My grandson will end up
behind a plow too.

220
00:24:58,123 --> 00:24:59,875
You were saying, sir?

221
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,003
Seen any good
traveling troupes lately?

222
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:07,257
I did see
the Trailokyatarini company.

223
00:25:07,841 --> 00:25:10,135
Gupe, what are you doing?

224
00:25:11,178 --> 00:25:14,389
The next village over

225
00:25:14,514 --> 00:25:17,142
booked a very good company.

226
00:25:17,309 --> 00:25:18,727
I'll thrash you!

227
00:25:18,894 --> 00:25:22,355
They thought
they could score one on us,

228
00:25:22,522 --> 00:25:26,610
but they didn't reckon
with Badyi Majumdar!

229
00:25:26,735 --> 00:25:30,989
I've booked
the finest troupe ever seen.

230
00:25:31,156 --> 00:25:32,991
Mr. Chakravarti!

231
00:25:33,158 --> 00:25:35,493
Let me have a little oil.

232
00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:37,162
Just a bit.

233
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:43,585
I haven't put you down
for a contribution yet,

234
00:25:43,752 --> 00:25:47,130
but in times of need
one can expect a favor, right?

235
00:25:47,255 --> 00:25:48,673
Of course.

236
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:52,761
Don't forget your friend
Badyi Majumdar.

237
00:25:54,262 --> 00:25:56,097
Mr. Chakravarti, wait!

238
00:25:56,389 --> 00:25:57,974
Here.

239
00:25:59,976 --> 00:26:03,939
When this troupe's
drummer plays,

240
00:26:04,064 --> 00:26:06,024
it sounds like thunder.

241
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:07,442
You don't say.

242
00:26:07,651 --> 00:26:11,404
Mr. Chakravarti, about
your subscription for the festival...

243
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:17,827
Sote!

244
00:26:18,078 --> 00:26:20,664
Show me your slate!

245
00:26:20,914 --> 00:26:23,124
Bring me his slate!

246
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:24,793
Bring it here!

247
00:26:29,923 --> 00:26:32,592
What's this?

248
00:26:32,884 --> 00:26:35,262
This is what you do
during dictation?

249
00:26:35,387 --> 00:26:38,932
Come here,
you little scoundrel!

250
00:26:46,064 --> 00:26:49,442
Hold out your hand!

251
00:27:28,023 --> 00:27:30,275
What are you doing?

252
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:33,111
What did you take?

253
00:27:36,823 --> 00:27:40,201
What were you doing in the kitchen?
- Nothing.

254
00:27:40,493 --> 00:27:44,331
Nothing? I saw you take
something from the shelf.

255
00:27:44,497 --> 00:27:48,335
I'm out of chilies.
I just thought I'd take a few.

256
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,003
Show me.

257
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,424
You should have asked.

258
00:27:55,342 --> 00:27:59,554
I've told you I don't like anyone
puttering in my kitchen.

259
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:19,824
When you're free, come here.

260
00:28:20,158 --> 00:28:22,202
I need you
to chop the greens.

261
00:28:29,042 --> 00:28:30,543
Sit down.

262
00:28:33,713 --> 00:28:37,050
At your age, other girls
are helping around the house,

263
00:28:37,217 --> 00:28:40,512
cooking, chopping vegetables,
scrubbing pots.

264
00:28:41,471 --> 00:28:45,058
They even help
with the religious rites.

265
00:28:47,936 --> 00:28:51,398
You think it's right
to be running around all day?

266
00:28:53,066 --> 00:28:56,820
If you admire Ranu so much,
why not learn from her?

267
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:12,544
Have you got
a fever again today?

268
00:29:12,752 --> 00:29:14,337
Let me see.

269
00:29:16,756 --> 00:29:19,134
Remember to drink
your basil tea.

270
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:25,473
Run and tell your mother
we were at Puti's house.

271
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,267
You're back?

272
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:38,987
Don't touch!
Now you've done it.

273
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,281
Mommy, I'm hungry.

274
00:29:41,406 --> 00:29:44,284
Didn't you have some rice?

275
00:29:44,409 --> 00:29:46,286
- Yes.
- Well, then?

276
00:29:46,453 --> 00:29:48,705
Apu! Come here!

277
00:29:50,081 --> 00:29:53,877
There's rice in the big bowl.
Ask Durga for some.

278
00:30:01,468 --> 00:30:02,927
Hari!

279
00:30:03,344 --> 00:30:05,180
Help me up.

280
00:30:05,472 --> 00:30:07,015
What's wrong?

281
00:30:10,727 --> 00:30:12,812
My back's gotten so stiff.

282
00:30:12,979 --> 00:30:14,981
How are you these days?

283
00:30:15,148 --> 00:30:18,651
Oh, no one cares
about an old woman.

284
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:22,197
- What's happened now?
- Just look at this.

285
00:30:26,493 --> 00:30:27,952
What's that?

286
00:30:28,077 --> 00:30:29,829
My shawl.

287
00:30:29,996 --> 00:30:32,999
I wear it in the evenings.

288
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:36,669
I'll buy you a new one
for the <i>puja</i> festival.

289
00:30:36,794 --> 00:30:39,464
- Really?
- Yes.

290
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,512
Can I have some live coals?

291
00:30:50,016 --> 00:30:53,603
How can I supply you
with coals all the time?

292
00:30:53,728 --> 00:30:56,231
Did you bring in some firewood?

293
00:31:07,033 --> 00:31:10,703
Did you ask for your pay today?
How long will you keep quiet?

294
00:31:10,828 --> 00:31:14,290
- Mr. Ray has problems with his land.
- So what?

295
00:31:14,415 --> 00:31:17,752
I could lose my job
if I ask now.

296
00:31:17,877 --> 00:31:21,548
So be it. I'm sure there are
other jobs in town.

297
00:31:21,673 --> 00:31:24,884
Eight rupees,
and no pay in three months.

298
00:31:25,009 --> 00:31:28,054
Some job!
- This has never happened before.

299
00:31:28,221 --> 00:31:31,933
So you sit and do nothing?
Have you seen the house

300
00:31:32,267 --> 00:31:35,353
and what the children
are eating and wearing?

301
00:31:36,396 --> 00:31:38,690
Durga has had a fever for days.

302
00:31:38,856 --> 00:31:41,192
There's no medicine
or even proper food.

303
00:31:41,317 --> 00:31:44,279
The boy goes to school in rags.
Is that right?

304
00:31:47,615 --> 00:31:49,701
Here.

305
00:31:56,916 --> 00:32:00,795
We can set aside repairs,
but debts must be repaid.

306
00:32:01,087 --> 00:32:04,090
I borrowed five rupees from
Mrs. Mukherjee six months ago,

307
00:32:04,257 --> 00:32:07,051
and she's quick
with the cutting remarks.

308
00:32:08,011 --> 00:32:10,013
Do something,
for goodness' sake!

309
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,685
Sit down.

310
00:32:28,197 --> 00:32:30,241
You won't tell Mother?

311
00:32:35,622 --> 00:32:39,000
Idiot! She'll hear you!

312
00:33:16,496 --> 00:33:18,164
The sweets seller.

313
00:33:26,047 --> 00:33:27,882
Do you want anything?

314
00:33:28,174 --> 00:33:31,511
Delicious fried cream,
sweet lentil balls,

315
00:33:31,678 --> 00:33:34,138
coconut candies,
<i>chandrapuli,</i>

316
00:33:34,347 --> 00:33:36,265
sweet cheese balls.

317
00:33:36,474 --> 00:33:39,727
- Go ask Father for money.
- You go.

318
00:33:40,186 --> 00:33:41,813
Go on!

319
00:34:01,165 --> 00:34:03,418
I suppose
he's asking for money.

320
00:34:04,085 --> 00:34:06,879
Don't give him any.
It's a bad habit.

321
00:34:09,882 --> 00:34:11,050
Nothing?

322
00:34:16,222 --> 00:34:18,891
He's headed for Tunu's house.

323
00:35:43,768 --> 00:35:46,604
Chinibas is here!

324
00:35:52,735 --> 00:35:55,738
What's going on?
Off with you.

325
00:35:56,072 --> 00:35:58,241
What do you have today?

326
00:35:58,449 --> 00:36:01,911
Mother wants two <i>annas'</i> worth.

327
00:36:02,036 --> 00:36:03,955
Durga, come and play.

328
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:07,250
Durga's on our team!
- Apu, come play!

329
00:36:07,416 --> 00:36:09,752
Want to come play?

330
00:36:10,086 --> 00:36:12,880
Then go home.
I'll be there soon.

331
00:36:14,841 --> 00:36:17,343
Apu's left out...

332
00:36:22,974 --> 00:36:25,476
Durga, would you like
some sweets?

333
00:36:25,685 --> 00:36:28,062
I said not to offer them any.

334
00:36:28,187 --> 00:36:30,356
They can buy their own!

335
00:36:30,481 --> 00:36:32,692
I can't stand
such shameless greed!

336
00:36:32,984 --> 00:36:34,068
Show me.

337
00:36:39,615 --> 00:36:41,993
Tunu, you coming to play?

338
00:36:43,578 --> 00:36:45,162
Tunu?

339
00:36:47,915 --> 00:36:49,876
What are you doing?

340
00:36:52,378 --> 00:36:54,046
How pretty.

341
00:36:56,507 --> 00:36:58,968
Who gave them to you?
- My father.

342
00:37:00,636 --> 00:37:02,555
Let me help you.

343
00:37:03,139 --> 00:37:04,599
Come on.

344
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,186
Open up.

345
00:37:10,354 --> 00:37:13,399
Come get your candy, Sunil.

346
00:37:15,401 --> 00:37:17,153
Come, Khuku.

347
00:38:51,247 --> 00:38:54,959
How many times
have I asked for a new shawl?

348
00:38:55,126 --> 00:38:57,628
I need it for the evenings.

349
00:38:58,838 --> 00:39:01,173
Durga, come here.

350
00:39:14,603 --> 00:39:16,981
What about your hair?
Sit down.

351
00:39:35,583 --> 00:39:38,919
Mother, can you braid it
in four strands?

352
00:39:39,211 --> 00:39:41,213
Keep your head still.

353
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:45,051
Ranu knows how.

354
00:39:46,093 --> 00:39:48,054
Look at your hair.

355
00:39:48,387 --> 00:39:50,431
Not a drop of oil,

356
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:53,142
and you want four strands!

357
00:39:54,894 --> 00:39:56,729
Mother, did you know

358
00:39:56,854 --> 00:39:59,857
that a prospective match
is coming to visit Ranu?

359
00:40:00,024 --> 00:40:01,692
Who's coming?

360
00:40:35,726 --> 00:40:38,729
Didi, have you ever seen a train?

361
00:40:39,105 --> 00:40:41,107
- Sure.
- Don't lie.

362
00:40:41,607 --> 00:40:43,901
You know where the tracks are?

363
00:40:44,068 --> 00:40:45,152
Where?

364
00:40:45,444 --> 00:40:49,740
Past the big meadow
and beyond the rice fields.

365
00:40:50,116 --> 00:40:53,494
- Shall we go one day?
- Let's see what you wrote.

366
00:40:57,832 --> 00:41:00,251
Very good!

367
00:41:00,584 --> 00:41:02,920
Now write...

368
00:41:03,462 --> 00:41:05,548
"Yikes! A ghost!"

369
00:41:37,371 --> 00:41:38,539
Here.

370
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:48,549
Did you do well
at school today?

371
00:42:01,187 --> 00:42:06,984
You're so young.
Don't the other boys tease you?

372
00:42:13,616 --> 00:42:15,951
Apu, come here.

373
00:42:21,916 --> 00:42:24,710
Be a good boy and eat.

374
00:42:25,711 --> 00:42:27,630
You mustn't waste it.

375
00:42:28,172 --> 00:42:30,841
Apu, come here.

376
00:42:32,635 --> 00:42:34,720
Don't you want it?

377
00:42:39,934 --> 00:42:42,228
Fine, then. Don't eat.

378
00:42:43,562 --> 00:42:47,107
Nothing sweet to go with it.
Just plain rice.

379
00:42:48,734 --> 00:42:51,237
No wonder he runs off.

380
00:42:51,612 --> 00:42:53,572
How will he survive?

381
00:42:53,697 --> 00:42:56,033
Was he even born to survive?

382
00:42:57,326 --> 00:42:59,411
Go rinse your mouth.

383
00:43:07,753 --> 00:43:09,922
Where's Durga?

384
00:43:10,422 --> 00:43:13,425
- Shall I go get her toy box?
- Yes.

385
00:43:14,843 --> 00:43:17,429
A fine way
to bring up your daughter!

386
00:43:19,223 --> 00:43:20,891
What's happened?

387
00:43:21,225 --> 00:43:24,228
Thievery, that's what!
Your daughter stole

388
00:43:24,353 --> 00:43:26,605
Tunu's bead necklace.

389
00:43:28,315 --> 00:43:30,567
She stole it?

390
00:43:30,693 --> 00:43:34,947
Don't look so surprised.
She's a thief through and through.

391
00:43:38,951 --> 00:43:41,912
Her father brought it
for her from town.

392
00:43:42,204 --> 00:43:45,541
Tunu showed it to your daughter.

393
00:43:45,833 --> 00:43:48,294
Then this morning it vanished

394
00:43:48,419 --> 00:43:49,920
in broad daylight!

395
00:43:52,756 --> 00:43:55,009
She's had her eye on it all along,

396
00:43:55,134 --> 00:43:57,594
asking to see it every day.

397
00:43:57,803 --> 00:44:01,181
You won't find it in there,
and Durga isn't home.

398
00:44:01,307 --> 00:44:03,434
How do you know
she took it anyway?

399
00:44:03,642 --> 00:44:05,602
- Durga said —
- Quiet!

400
00:44:05,769 --> 00:44:08,272
Are you suggesting
we hid it somewhere?

401
00:44:08,647 --> 00:44:12,693
- No, but it might have fallen off —
- It didn't.

402
00:44:12,985 --> 00:44:15,446
We searched high and low.

403
00:44:15,571 --> 00:44:17,448
I wouldn't be here otherwise.

404
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:30,544
Did you take Tunu's necklace?

405
00:44:32,171 --> 00:44:34,173
Didn't you?

406
00:44:34,298 --> 00:44:36,175
Take your hands off her!

407
00:44:36,342 --> 00:44:39,011
- She's a liar.
- Let me see.

408
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:42,765
I suppose that fruit
is from your own orchard?

409
00:44:43,307 --> 00:44:45,267
What's going on?

410
00:44:52,316 --> 00:44:56,528
What's going on here? Huh?

411
00:45:00,449 --> 00:45:02,326
What's the matter?

412
00:45:07,414 --> 00:45:09,208
What's going on?

413
00:45:09,917 --> 00:45:12,544
Sarbajaya, what is it?

414
00:45:21,887 --> 00:45:24,223
You know we have no orchard,

415
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:27,726
and I know it's wrong
to take other people's fruit.

416
00:45:27,893 --> 00:45:32,773
But how can you accuse her
of stealing something of value?

417
00:45:33,107 --> 00:45:36,402
Fruit has no name on it.
If a child happens to —

418
00:45:36,777 --> 00:45:41,031
Well! The rupees I lent you
had no name on them either,

419
00:45:41,156 --> 00:45:42,783
and you took them
eagerly enough!

420
00:45:43,409 --> 00:45:46,703
You've had them long enough.
I'd like them back.

421
00:45:46,829 --> 00:45:48,163
Come along.

422
00:45:50,707 --> 00:45:54,253
Should you find that necklace,
kindly return it.

423
00:46:02,261 --> 00:46:03,929
What's going on?

424
00:46:04,096 --> 00:46:07,474
Our fruit vanishes
the moment it hits the ground.

425
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:10,310
When I complain,
the mother is insolent to me!

426
00:46:10,602 --> 00:46:12,688
"Fruit has no name on it.

427
00:46:12,813 --> 00:46:15,274
So what if a child takes some?"

428
00:46:15,399 --> 00:46:17,484
Like mother, like daughter!

429
00:46:17,609 --> 00:46:19,695
A pair of thieves!

430
00:46:27,244 --> 00:46:28,287
Come here.

431
00:46:30,747 --> 00:46:32,708
I said come here.

432
00:46:34,293 --> 00:46:36,086
You won't come?

433
00:47:24,009 --> 00:47:25,177
Get out!

434
00:48:21,441 --> 00:48:24,987
"...and that measure
is called a <i>maund.</i>

435
00:48:25,153 --> 00:48:30,409
A rupee is divided into <i>annas,
gondas,</i> and cowries..."

436
00:48:51,388 --> 00:48:52,598
Apu.

437
00:48:53,056 --> 00:48:56,560
Durga's meal is waiting.
Go get her.

438
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:19,833
<i>Just then...</i>

439
00:49:19,958 --> 00:49:22,961
<i>a demoness appeared.</i>

440
00:49:23,462 --> 00:49:27,966
"Krik, krak, krud,
I smell human blood.

441
00:49:28,133 --> 00:49:30,969
Who lies awake in my temple?"

442
00:49:31,345 --> 00:49:33,430
The blue prince slept

443
00:49:33,555 --> 00:49:36,391
while the red prince kept watch.

444
00:49:37,934 --> 00:49:41,146
In the second watch of the night,

445
00:49:41,313 --> 00:49:43,273
the demoness appeared again.

446
00:49:43,398 --> 00:49:47,653
"Krik, krak, krud,
I smell human blood.

447
00:49:47,903 --> 00:49:50,989
Who lies awake in my temple?"

448
00:49:51,114 --> 00:49:55,077
<i>- Durga, open the door.</i>
- I'll be right back.

449
00:49:57,913 --> 00:50:01,667
<i>Give this to your mother
and ask her to come here.</i>

450
00:50:08,006 --> 00:50:09,675
Set it down.

451
00:50:15,305 --> 00:50:19,101
- Are you asleep in there?
- What is it?

452
00:50:19,226 --> 00:50:21,978
Come here.
I have a lot to tell you.

453
00:50:24,231 --> 00:50:26,983
Durga, watch the milk.

454
00:50:36,785 --> 00:50:38,370
What?

455
00:50:44,084 --> 00:50:46,420
No matter what people say...

456
00:50:48,046 --> 00:50:50,340
Mr. Ray is a good man.

457
00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:56,179
Here you are.

458
00:50:57,222 --> 00:51:00,559
Three months' wages — 24 rupees.
Count it.

459
00:51:00,726 --> 00:51:03,019
I'll quickly say
my evening prayers.

460
00:51:03,145 --> 00:51:05,564
I have lots more to tell you.

461
00:51:21,413 --> 00:51:23,874
I was collecting rents today

462
00:51:24,082 --> 00:51:27,919
when I met
a distinguished-looking fellow.

463
00:51:28,211 --> 00:51:31,089
He suddenly bowed deeply
and said,

464
00:51:31,256 --> 00:51:35,135
"Sir, you don't know me,
but I knew your father well.

465
00:51:36,011 --> 00:51:39,389
He often officiated
as a priest at my house."

466
00:51:39,598 --> 00:51:42,726
"What's your name?"
"Mahesh Biswas."

467
00:51:42,893 --> 00:51:45,270
"What do you want?"

468
00:51:45,437 --> 00:51:48,356
"I have something to ask of you."
"What?"

469
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:53,028
"My whole family would like
to be initiated next month.

470
00:51:53,153 --> 00:51:56,448
It would be wonderful
if you could officiate."

471
00:51:58,617 --> 00:52:02,078
Quite wealthy people.
- Did you say you'd do it?

472
00:52:02,829 --> 00:52:05,832
Are you crazy?
Accept right off?

473
00:52:05,957 --> 00:52:08,168
They'd think I was hard up.

474
00:52:08,293 --> 00:52:11,463
Let them.
We <i>are</i> hard up.

475
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:16,259
There could be a scandal
if people found out his caste.

476
00:52:16,384 --> 00:52:18,762
- Who would tell them?
- You never know.

477
00:52:18,929 --> 00:52:22,307
Maybe you.
I know how you women are.

478
00:52:23,016 --> 00:52:27,479
I'm busy enough without running
around telling your business.

479
00:52:27,687 --> 00:52:31,650
Don't be angry.
The job's not going anywhere.

480
00:52:32,234 --> 00:52:35,111
I told him we'd discuss it
after the festival.

481
00:52:35,278 --> 00:52:37,322
I mustn't seem overeager.

482
00:52:37,489 --> 00:52:40,242
Try to manage till then
on what I gave you.

483
00:52:40,367 --> 00:52:44,579
That should cover clothes for the kids
and a shawl for Auntie.

484
00:52:44,871 --> 00:52:47,040
We must pay
Mrs. Mukherjee tomorrow.

485
00:52:47,165 --> 00:52:51,545
Fine. Our other debts
can wait two months.

486
00:52:53,421 --> 00:52:55,382
And the repairs?

487
00:52:55,507 --> 00:52:58,969
They'll wait too.
The house survived the rains.

488
00:52:59,177 --> 00:53:03,014
I'll get an estimate
from the carpenter this month.

489
00:53:03,139 --> 00:53:06,309
You have to do something
about the kitchen.

490
00:53:06,434 --> 00:53:10,856
Kitchen, cowshed, walls, roof —

491
00:53:10,981 --> 00:53:14,192
it will all be done.
Don't worry.

492
00:53:19,489 --> 00:53:22,284
How many more days
till the <i>puja</i> festival?

493
00:53:24,369 --> 00:53:26,037
Twenty-one.

494
00:53:37,382 --> 00:53:38,925
Didi.

495
00:53:43,013 --> 00:53:45,557
Did you take Tunu's necklace?

496
00:53:45,724 --> 00:53:47,309
Don't be silly.

497
00:53:49,352 --> 00:53:52,439
- Who did?
- I don't know. Go to sleep.

498
00:53:54,691 --> 00:53:57,402
I have an idea for a new play

499
00:53:58,153 --> 00:54:00,238
about Babhruvahana.

500
00:54:00,906 --> 00:54:03,658
I'll write it
when I find some time.

501
00:54:13,877 --> 00:54:15,545
Listen...

502
00:54:16,087 --> 00:54:18,757
you lived in Benares a long time.

503
00:54:19,758 --> 00:54:22,510
Do people know you there?

504
00:54:23,428 --> 00:54:25,555
Some certainly do.

505
00:54:26,264 --> 00:54:29,267
Isn't there a ghat by the river

506
00:54:29,601 --> 00:54:33,730
where priests sing
and recite from the scriptures?

507
00:54:34,356 --> 00:54:37,943
It's called
Dashashamedh Ghat.

508
00:54:38,443 --> 00:54:42,155
- They earn a lot there, right?
- I suppose.

509
00:54:42,405 --> 00:54:44,407
Then let's go.

510
00:54:45,241 --> 00:54:47,619
- We can't do that.
- Why not?

511
00:54:48,119 --> 00:54:49,955
How can we?

512
00:54:50,288 --> 00:54:54,042
I left there to return here
to my ancestral home.

513
00:54:54,334 --> 00:54:57,170
I can't go
the other direction now.

514
00:54:57,462 --> 00:55:00,966
Why not? You were away
eight years before.

515
00:55:01,132 --> 00:55:04,511
You left me at my father's
and never even wrote.

516
00:55:04,636 --> 00:55:07,305
I didn't really know you then.

517
00:55:07,597 --> 00:55:10,976
Think I'd have left if I did?
- A lot of difference it's made!

518
00:55:11,726 --> 00:55:14,813
This is my home now too.

519
00:55:17,649 --> 00:55:19,651
But just look at it.

520
00:55:19,985 --> 00:55:22,237
It's like living in the jungle.

521
00:55:23,363 --> 00:55:27,200
Jackals prowling around
as soon as night falls.

522
00:55:28,952 --> 00:55:33,164
No neighbors to sit and talk to.

523
00:55:34,249 --> 00:55:36,334
When you're not here,

524
00:55:36,835 --> 00:55:40,380
I'm terribly uneasy.

525
00:55:42,674 --> 00:55:44,968
But you wouldn't understand.

526
00:55:46,386 --> 00:55:49,180
You eat and sleep
and go about your work,

527
00:55:49,305 --> 00:55:52,308
unconcerned
whether you're paid or not.

528
00:55:55,228 --> 00:55:57,522
I had lots of dreams too.

529
00:55:57,981 --> 00:56:00,734
All the things I wanted to do...

530
00:56:05,155 --> 00:56:09,909
<i>Those who came before
have passed on</i>

531
00:56:10,118 --> 00:56:13,204
<i>And I'm left behind</i>

532
00:56:13,705 --> 00:56:19,335
<i>A penniless beggar</i>

533
00:56:19,502 --> 00:56:21,713
<i>Not a cowrie to my name</i>

534
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:24,966
<i>Look, my purse is empty</i>

535
00:56:41,441 --> 00:56:46,112
<i>Lord, the day is done
and evening falls</i>

536
00:56:46,446 --> 00:56:49,741
<i>Ferry me across
to the other shore</i>

537
00:57:13,139 --> 00:57:17,393
Apu, hurry with the wood.
The fire's not taking.

538
00:57:19,354 --> 00:57:21,981
Is that washed?
Set it down.

539
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:23,983
This blade!

540
00:57:35,662 --> 00:57:39,415
- Granny, are you getting married?
- Where's your mother?

541
00:57:39,582 --> 00:57:41,334
At the pond.

542
00:57:45,296 --> 00:57:47,215
Umi, come join us.

543
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:49,509
We're having a picnic.

544
00:57:53,471 --> 00:57:55,807
All that? Set it down.

545
00:57:59,018 --> 00:58:01,855
Where's Nera?
- Up there.

546
00:58:02,230 --> 00:58:04,149
Get down here!

547
00:58:04,941 --> 00:58:08,528
Wash the banana leaf plates.
Sitting in the tree!

548
00:58:10,029 --> 00:58:12,490
Where'd you get
that shawl, Auntie?

549
00:58:12,824 --> 00:58:14,993
Raju gave it to me.

550
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:19,956
It cost him 9 1/2 <i>annas.</i>
- It's very nice.

551
00:58:23,501 --> 00:58:25,670
Here comes my sister!

552
00:58:26,713 --> 00:58:30,091
How'd you get away?
Isn't your mother home?

553
00:58:30,216 --> 00:58:33,428
- What are you making?
<i>- Khichuri.</i>

554
00:58:33,553 --> 00:58:36,848
Rice, lentils,
potatoes, eggplant,

555
00:58:37,015 --> 00:58:40,018
cumin, chilies,
bay leaves, oil —

556
00:58:44,981 --> 00:58:47,609
Tepi, didn't you bring salt?

557
00:58:48,026 --> 00:58:50,236
You only said oil!

558
00:58:50,361 --> 00:58:53,198
You said you'd bring it!

559
00:59:04,334 --> 00:59:05,627
Wait!

560
00:59:28,566 --> 00:59:30,068
Auntie.

561
00:59:32,779 --> 00:59:33,863
Listen.

562
00:59:34,239 --> 00:59:35,907
Come here.

563
00:59:45,291 --> 00:59:47,126
What's the matter?

564
00:59:54,384 --> 00:59:56,219
Where'd you get that shawl?

565
00:59:56,761 --> 00:59:59,264
Uh...

566
00:59:59,389 --> 01:00:03,017
Raju gave it to me.

567
01:00:03,142 --> 01:00:05,645
Gave it to you?
Listen to me.

568
01:00:08,439 --> 01:00:11,276
You didn't ask him for it?
- Why would I?

569
01:00:12,735 --> 01:00:17,615
I simply said that at my age
I get chilly in the evening —

570
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:20,243
Fine.
Then they can feed you too!

571
01:00:20,868 --> 01:00:22,453
Come now.

572
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:26,374
I did ask Harihar for a shawl.

573
01:00:26,749 --> 01:00:28,209
Did he say no?

574
01:00:28,376 --> 01:00:31,254
Did you have to go begging?
You should be ashamed!

575
01:00:31,379 --> 01:00:33,965
What must Raju think?

576
01:00:34,132 --> 01:00:36,384
Can't an old woman
have wishes too?

577
01:00:37,176 --> 01:00:40,638
So you have wishes now —
while you eat our food!

578
01:00:40,763 --> 01:00:43,474
You realize the children
often go hungry?

579
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:45,601
What about their wishes?

580
01:00:45,727 --> 01:00:48,229
Will you feed and clothe them?

581
01:00:48,354 --> 01:00:50,857
As long as you're
dependent on me,

582
01:00:50,982 --> 01:00:53,151
don't go around begging.

583
01:00:53,651 --> 01:00:56,237
Otherwise
make other arrangements.

584
01:00:56,612 --> 01:00:59,657
Put me up or don't.

585
01:01:00,533 --> 01:01:05,204
Think I have nowhere to go?
- Fine! Then leave at once!

586
01:01:22,305 --> 01:01:23,931
What's wrong?

587
01:01:32,815 --> 01:01:34,692
What's the matter?

588
01:01:37,195 --> 01:01:38,738
There, there.

589
01:01:41,407 --> 01:01:43,409
Go wherever you like.

590
01:01:44,285 --> 01:01:46,662
I can't keep you here any longer.

591
01:01:51,959 --> 01:01:53,628
It's delicious.

592
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:57,715
Your husband will love your cooking.
- Hush!

593
01:02:01,552 --> 01:02:04,430
- How long until your wedding?
- I don't know.

594
01:02:04,722 --> 01:02:07,433
- I know. Shall I tell you?
- All right.

595
01:02:07,892 --> 01:02:11,521
Two months and ten days, right?

596
01:02:13,815 --> 01:02:17,276
How's it feel?
- Same as for everyone.

597
01:02:17,402 --> 01:02:18,736
Tell me.

598
01:02:18,903 --> 01:02:20,196
You'll find out.

599
01:02:20,405 --> 01:02:22,240
It won't happen to me.

600
01:02:22,407 --> 01:02:23,699
Sure it will.

601
01:02:23,825 --> 01:02:26,452
- I just know it won't.
- It will.

602
01:02:26,619 --> 01:02:29,455
Your mother's looking
for a suitable match.

603
01:02:29,622 --> 01:02:31,916
It's true. Ask her.

604
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:54,147
Raju...

605
01:02:55,773 --> 01:02:57,692
are you home?

606
01:02:57,817 --> 01:02:59,318
<i>Who's that?</i>

607
01:02:59,444 --> 01:03:02,822
- I've come to see...
<i>- Auntie?</i>

608
01:03:03,656 --> 01:03:06,325
if you could take me in

609
01:03:06,451 --> 01:03:09,412
for a day or two.

610
01:03:09,537 --> 01:03:12,957
<i>- To stay?</i>
- Just a day or two.

611
01:03:13,124 --> 01:03:15,585
I get no peace at home.

612
01:03:15,710 --> 01:03:18,296
Nothing but nagging
day and night.

613
01:03:20,339 --> 01:03:21,966
<i>Listen...</i>

614
01:03:23,050 --> 01:03:27,138
<i>go tell your mother
Auntie has come to stay.</i>

615
01:03:27,305 --> 01:03:30,183
<i>And bring Auntie
water for her feet.</i>

616
01:03:30,308 --> 01:03:34,270
Where else can
this old woman go?

617
01:03:34,437 --> 01:03:36,856
So I thought I'd come see you.

618
01:03:40,902 --> 01:03:42,487
My child...

619
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:47,700
if you don't look after me,
who will?

620
01:04:45,091 --> 01:04:48,094
Beware, O evil Serpent King!

621
01:04:48,386 --> 01:04:50,638
Utter such words again

622
01:04:50,805 --> 01:04:53,516
and I shall cut your tongue out

623
01:04:53,641 --> 01:04:57,979
and cast it to the jackals and dogs
for the good of the world!

624
01:04:58,145 --> 01:05:01,941
And for the good of the world
I shall destroy you!

625
01:05:02,149 --> 01:05:05,361
No, Father, I beseech you!

626
01:05:05,528 --> 01:05:08,030
Do not make
your own daughter a widow.

627
01:05:08,197 --> 01:05:10,408
Away, dissolute serpent woman!

628
01:05:10,575 --> 01:05:12,410
Sujata!

629
01:05:12,535 --> 01:05:14,495
Why do you forget your place?

630
01:05:14,829 --> 01:05:17,415
No longer are you
the Serpent King's daughter!

631
01:05:17,623 --> 01:05:21,210
You are the wife of one
descended from the mighty sun!

632
01:05:21,419 --> 01:05:23,921
Why, for the sake
of my humble life,

633
01:05:24,088 --> 01:05:27,592
do you prostrate
before a despicable serpent?

634
01:05:27,717 --> 01:05:31,095
No, I would not even
imagine your death.

635
01:05:31,304 --> 01:05:34,140
Father, trample me all you will,

636
01:05:34,265 --> 01:05:37,768
only grant me
the vermilion mark of marriage!

637
01:05:37,893 --> 01:05:42,315
A human can ask
for nothing from a serpent!

638
01:05:42,481 --> 01:05:46,819
Away from me,
you shameless hussy!

639
01:05:46,944 --> 01:05:49,447
Sujata, arise!

640
01:05:49,614 --> 01:05:52,491
Heed your husband's words!

641
01:05:52,617 --> 01:05:54,577
No!

642
01:05:54,994 --> 01:05:58,664
Kill me first, Father,
and then do as you propose.

643
01:05:58,789 --> 01:06:02,084
Let me go!

644
01:06:02,293 --> 01:06:05,212
Let him go!
If there is indeed a god,

645
01:06:05,379 --> 01:06:08,257
the serpent's pride
will be destroyed!

646
01:06:08,382 --> 01:06:11,344
No, your pride
will be destroyed first!

647
01:06:11,469 --> 01:06:12,928
Mahakal...

648
01:06:13,054 --> 01:06:15,306
see how my daughter
holds me back!

649
01:06:15,473 --> 01:06:17,141
Slay him!

650
01:06:17,308 --> 01:06:20,311
Be merciless in your revenge!

651
01:06:20,436 --> 01:06:22,521
Do you remember, Kusha,

652
01:06:22,647 --> 01:06:25,149
how I swore on the battlefield

653
01:06:25,316 --> 01:06:27,985
to crush your skull
beneath my boot?

654
01:06:28,110 --> 01:06:31,155
Today is my chance!
- No, Mahakal.

655
01:06:31,322 --> 01:06:33,574
My brother! My friend!

656
01:06:33,699 --> 01:06:36,994
I beseech you, spare his life!

657
01:06:37,536 --> 01:06:39,955
Pay her no heed!

658
01:06:40,289 --> 01:06:42,500
Slay the evil Kusha!

659
01:06:42,667 --> 01:06:44,669
I will deal with my daughter!

660
01:06:44,835 --> 01:06:47,129
Come, you wicked woman!

661
01:06:47,296 --> 01:06:49,465
Let me go, Father!

662
01:06:51,926 --> 01:06:54,804
Today I shall slake
my thirst for revenge!

663
01:06:54,929 --> 01:06:57,973
Take this, my husband,
and protect yourself!

664
01:06:58,099 --> 01:07:00,434
See now, you demon!

665
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:03,854
Now the victorious trumpet
will sound!

666
01:07:04,271 --> 01:07:09,652
Will someone here
give me a weapon

667
01:07:09,777 --> 01:07:14,156
that I may spill his blood?

668
01:07:14,365 --> 01:07:17,618
Take this, O King...

669
01:07:17,827 --> 01:07:20,621
and join the battle!

670
01:07:20,788 --> 01:07:22,998
Take this weapon, sister...

671
01:07:23,124 --> 01:07:25,751
and save your husband!

672
01:07:49,942 --> 01:07:53,446
Durga,
go see where the calf went.

673
01:07:53,612 --> 01:07:56,907
- Mommy, would you tie this on me?
- Wait.

674
01:07:57,074 --> 01:07:59,076
Am I your servant now?

675
01:07:59,243 --> 01:08:02,621
Apu, let's go look for Auntie.

676
01:08:03,038 --> 01:08:05,833
No, go find the calf first.

677
01:08:06,751 --> 01:08:08,461
What's that?

678
01:08:11,422 --> 01:08:13,716
Where did you get that foil?

679
01:08:51,086 --> 01:08:53,047
How dare you!

680
01:08:54,256 --> 01:08:56,550
What's this? Durga!

681
01:08:57,343 --> 01:08:59,512
What's going on?

682
01:08:59,637 --> 01:09:02,723
Are you hitting him again?
- He was in my toy box.

683
01:09:02,890 --> 01:09:06,477
So what? What use
is your precious toy box?

684
01:09:07,144 --> 01:09:09,355
- He took all my foil.
- Enough!

685
01:09:09,522 --> 01:09:11,649
Go find the calf.

686
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:18,447
Idiot!

687
01:09:18,739 --> 01:09:21,075
Dressing up as a prince!

688
01:10:42,948 --> 01:10:46,911
Sarbajaya, are you home?

689
01:10:47,119 --> 01:10:49,079
What brings you back?

690
01:10:51,916 --> 01:10:54,543
I'm not feeling very well.

691
01:10:54,710 --> 01:10:59,882
I thought I'd spend
my last days in the old home.

692
01:11:00,049 --> 01:11:03,719
Don't use that excuse.
A lot you care about the old home!

693
01:11:03,886 --> 01:11:06,472
You'd better leave
or there'll be trouble.

694
01:11:06,764 --> 01:11:08,766
Just give me a minute.

695
01:11:34,959 --> 01:11:36,961
Sitting down, are you?

696
01:11:37,962 --> 01:11:41,215
Let me catch my breath.

697
01:12:07,157 --> 01:12:08,826
Auntie?

698
01:12:09,159 --> 01:12:11,662
Did you fall asleep?

699
01:12:13,163 --> 01:12:15,958
Would you give me
some water?

700
01:12:16,291 --> 01:12:19,169
The pitcher's right there.
Help yourself.

701
01:16:39,221 --> 01:16:40,806
Didi!

702
01:16:59,283 --> 01:17:00,325
Sit down.

703
01:17:04,454 --> 01:17:05,747
Eat it.

704
01:17:11,795 --> 01:17:13,797
Where are we?

705
01:17:14,464 --> 01:17:16,341
What are those?

706
01:17:20,470 --> 01:17:22,180
If Mommy —

707
01:20:08,180 --> 01:20:09,890
Auntie?

708
01:21:02,776 --> 01:21:07,906
<i>Lord, the day is done
and evening falls</i>

709
01:21:08,073 --> 01:21:11,201
<i>Ferry me across
to the other shore</i>

710
01:21:12,118 --> 01:21:15,914
<i>They say you are
the lord of the crossing</i>

711
01:21:16,081 --> 01:21:20,418
<i>I call out to you</i>

712
01:21:30,095 --> 01:21:35,141
<i>Lord, the day is done
and evening falls</i>

713
01:21:35,350 --> 01:21:38,895
<i>Ferry me across
to the other shore</i>

714
01:21:48,196 --> 01:21:52,075
<i>You take those across</i>

715
01:21:52,659 --> 01:21:57,747
<i>Who haven't a cowrie
to their name</i>

716
01:22:06,548 --> 01:22:09,092
<i>I'm a poor beggar</i>

717
01:22:09,259 --> 01:22:13,096
<i>Without a cowrie to my name</i>

718
01:22:17,976 --> 01:22:20,812
Come see Delhi!

719
01:22:20,937 --> 01:22:22,772
See the Qutub Tower...

720
01:22:23,773 --> 01:22:26,443
the Taj Mahal in Agra...

721
01:22:26,568 --> 01:22:30,280
the temples of Mathura,
the harbor of Bombay!

722
01:22:37,495 --> 01:22:41,082
- When will you be back?
- In a week or so.

723
01:22:41,249 --> 01:22:44,002
I'll stop in Bishnupur
on the way back.

724
01:22:44,127 --> 01:22:46,129
It's a market town.

725
01:22:46,296 --> 01:22:50,592
If I got a monthly account,
we could relax.

726
01:22:51,968 --> 01:22:54,095
Where'd I put that thing?

727
01:23:10,445 --> 01:23:12,364
I'm off.

728
01:23:16,117 --> 01:23:17,702
Good-bye.

729
01:23:46,690 --> 01:23:49,317
Apu, there's Father.

730
01:23:52,654 --> 01:23:55,156
Go ask him for some money.

731
01:24:29,149 --> 01:24:30,567
<i>Durga...</i>

732
01:24:31,025 --> 01:24:32,652
<i>come here.</i>

733
01:24:35,363 --> 01:24:38,908
- I want to make some <i>bodi.</i>
- Do something for me first.

734
01:24:39,701 --> 01:24:41,995
Go buy some molasses.

735
01:24:43,705 --> 01:24:46,374
I'll make rice pudding for Apu.
- Go now?

736
01:24:46,583 --> 01:24:47,959
Yes.

737
01:24:48,084 --> 01:24:50,670
He's been asking for it for days.

738
01:24:58,553 --> 01:25:01,264
A letter!

739
01:25:07,312 --> 01:25:09,105
Who's it from?

740
01:25:09,606 --> 01:25:11,232
Let me see.

741
01:25:13,443 --> 01:25:15,028
Give it here.

742
01:25:25,580 --> 01:25:28,291
<i>I arrived
in Dasghara yesterday</i>

743
01:25:28,416 --> 01:25:31,461
<i>and met with Mahesh Biswas.</i>

744
01:25:31,669 --> 01:25:35,632
<i>The poor man recently lost
two of his children,</i>

745
01:25:35,882 --> 01:25:39,636
<i>so it was no time to mention
the initiation ceremony.</i>

746
01:25:39,803 --> 01:25:41,971
<i>I'm leaving for Bishnupur today.</i>

747
01:25:42,096 --> 01:25:43,765
<i>Don't worry.</i>

748
01:25:43,932 --> 01:25:47,936
<i>I'll earn money for the repairs
and return home soon.</i>

749
01:25:48,061 --> 01:25:49,938
<i>Don't be anxious.</i>

750
01:25:54,067 --> 01:25:56,611
<i>Whatever God ordains
is for the best.</i>

751
01:25:56,778 --> 01:25:59,322
<i>Love and blessings
to Durga and Apu.</i>

752
01:25:59,572 --> 01:26:02,909
<i>Be charitable
from the goodness of your heart</i>

753
01:26:03,034 --> 01:26:05,954
<i>If I can reach
the Mother's blessed feet</i>

754
01:26:06,079 --> 01:26:09,749
<i>I shall place them
on the lotus seat of my heart</i>

755
01:26:09,874 --> 01:26:13,878
<i>What do I care
for worldly wealth?</i>

756
01:26:14,671 --> 01:26:16,840
Alms, good mother.

757
01:26:29,644 --> 01:26:32,897
Bless you.
May you be a queen one day.

758
01:32:45,228 --> 01:32:47,563
Just what were you thinking?

759
01:32:49,232 --> 01:32:51,901
How long would this
have gone on?

760
01:32:52,068 --> 01:32:55,863
We see each other every day.
You could have said something.

761
01:32:55,988 --> 01:32:58,074
Are we such strangers?

762
01:32:58,449 --> 01:33:00,201
What can I do?

763
01:33:00,701 --> 01:33:04,872
Every day
I think there'll be news.

764
01:33:07,375 --> 01:33:09,627
It's never been like this before.

765
01:33:10,086 --> 01:33:12,171
It's been five months.

766
01:33:12,463 --> 01:33:14,966
Not a letter, not a word.

767
01:33:15,591 --> 01:33:17,510
Send Durga with me.

768
01:33:17,635 --> 01:33:20,513
I'll give her something
to tide you over.

769
01:33:20,638 --> 01:33:22,265
Take this.

770
01:33:24,225 --> 01:33:27,103
Don't be childish.
- I can't.

771
01:33:27,395 --> 01:33:29,855
Then I'll leave it there.

772
01:33:31,065 --> 01:33:32,608
Let go!

773
01:33:32,775 --> 01:33:36,070
I still have the brass vessels
from my wedding!

774
01:33:59,093 --> 01:34:01,804
<i>A letter!</i>

775
01:34:17,778 --> 01:34:20,114
"To Mrs. Sarbajaya Devi."

776
01:34:22,700 --> 01:34:26,078
<i>I haven't been able to write
for four months.</i>

777
01:34:26,203 --> 01:34:30,333
<i>You must be worried.
In any case, I have good news.</i>

778
01:34:30,499 --> 01:34:33,002
<i>I found a way
to earn some money.</i>

779
01:34:33,127 --> 01:34:35,338
<i>I'll return home soon.</i>

780
01:34:35,546 --> 01:34:38,174
<i>It seems our luck has turned.</i>

781
01:34:38,341 --> 01:34:41,135
<i>Whatever God ordains
is for the best.</i>

782
01:37:33,015 --> 01:37:35,100
Holy pond and flower garland,

783
01:37:35,226 --> 01:37:37,645
who worships here
in the noonday sun?

784
01:37:38,604 --> 01:37:42,566
It is I, Leelavati, a maiden pure,
sister of my brothers.

785
01:38:08,050 --> 01:38:10,261
May my sons be numberless,

786
01:38:10,386 --> 01:38:12,846
and may I die
by the holy Ganges.

787
01:38:17,977 --> 01:38:20,729
Mother Goddess, counsel me.

788
01:38:20,854 --> 01:38:24,191
I know not how to pray.

789
01:38:24,316 --> 01:38:27,111
Grant me this blessing.

790
01:41:03,016 --> 01:41:05,102
By leaf of lime

791
01:41:05,227 --> 01:41:07,020
and <i>karamcha</i> tree,

792
01:41:07,187 --> 01:41:09,898
rain, rain, away with thee!

793
01:41:48,562 --> 01:41:52,483
Rain, rain, away with thee!

794
01:42:06,663 --> 01:42:08,665
Show me your tongue.

795
01:42:17,883 --> 01:42:19,885
Any word from Harihar?

796
01:42:20,344 --> 01:42:23,931
He wrote
that he'd be back this month.

797
01:42:24,473 --> 01:42:26,517
Why does he wander so much?

798
01:42:26,642 --> 01:42:29,186
You have any sago?

799
01:42:30,270 --> 01:42:33,315
I can give you some.
Just send Apu over.

800
01:42:33,649 --> 01:42:37,444
Give her that,
and if her fever goes up,

801
01:42:37,569 --> 01:42:39,613
place a damp cloth
on her forehead.

802
01:42:40,280 --> 01:42:42,324
No cause for alarm.

803
01:42:42,783 --> 01:42:44,952
Just don't let her catch a chill.

804
01:42:45,118 --> 01:42:47,204
Nilmoni, let's go.

805
01:42:50,332 --> 01:42:52,543
<i>What do you think, Doctor?</i>

806
01:42:52,668 --> 01:42:54,253
Come close.

807
01:42:55,128 --> 01:42:56,672
What?

808
01:42:56,797 --> 01:43:01,051
We'll go see the train
when I'm better, all right?

809
01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:04,847
We'll get there early
and have a good look.

810
01:43:04,972 --> 01:43:06,932
You want to?

811
01:47:56,304 --> 01:47:59,474
Hush. Don't be afraid.

812
01:48:20,912 --> 01:48:22,455
<i>I'm coming!</i>

813
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:26,209
What is it?

814
01:48:26,334 --> 01:48:28,920
Didi is worse.
Mommy says to come.

815
01:48:30,630 --> 01:48:31,965
I see.

816
01:48:32,841 --> 01:48:36,553
Bini, sweep the yard.
I'll be back soon.

817
01:48:36,678 --> 01:48:37,971
Let's go.

818
01:49:20,764 --> 01:49:23,308
Go get my husband, will you?

819
01:49:23,600 --> 01:49:25,727
Tell him I said to come.

820
01:49:28,104 --> 01:49:31,233
- Is Didi asleep?
- Yes. Now run along.

821
01:49:31,358 --> 01:49:33,485
That's a good boy.

822
01:52:26,574 --> 01:52:28,076
<i>Auntie?</i>

823
01:52:40,296 --> 01:52:42,048
Auntie?

824
01:52:44,759 --> 01:52:47,220
Mother sent these for you.

825
01:52:47,846 --> 01:52:49,806
I'll set them here.

826
01:53:38,730 --> 01:53:42,984
Couldn't it have waited
a bit longer?

827
01:54:48,675 --> 01:54:50,343
Khoka!

828
01:54:50,843 --> 01:54:52,387
Durga!

829
01:54:54,889 --> 01:54:57,058
Ah, you're home.

830
01:54:57,392 --> 01:54:58,977
Come.

831
01:55:15,910 --> 01:55:17,745
How are you?

832
01:55:26,879 --> 01:55:30,758
I take it the children
are out running around?

833
01:55:51,154 --> 01:55:53,364
Where are you going?

834
01:55:54,949 --> 01:55:57,577
Come see
the presents I brought.

835
01:55:57,702 --> 01:56:00,580
I'd have come home earlier
if I could.

836
01:56:00,913 --> 01:56:03,791
My luck finally turned
at Ranaghat.

837
01:56:03,958 --> 01:56:07,462
Made all the running around
worth it.

838
01:56:07,629 --> 01:56:09,881
This is from the <i>chadak</i> festival.

839
01:56:10,006 --> 01:56:12,008
Made out of jackfruit wood.

840
01:56:15,011 --> 01:56:18,222
And you wanted an image
of the goddess Lakshmi.

841
01:56:18,348 --> 01:56:20,767
I had it framed in glass.

842
01:56:21,643 --> 01:56:24,145
And this is for Durga.

843
01:56:24,395 --> 01:56:27,398
A new sari. Look.

844
01:56:28,775 --> 01:56:31,319
No need to worry anymore.
I'm back now.

845
01:58:09,584 --> 01:58:12,754
Khoka, take the things
off the shelves and put them

846
01:58:12,879 --> 01:58:14,630
on the bench.

847
01:58:14,756 --> 01:58:17,508
You know, this past year

848
01:58:17,633 --> 01:58:21,053
I've lost all attachment
to this ancestral home.

849
01:58:21,596 --> 01:58:25,600
If it weren't for you
and your husband,

850
01:58:26,142 --> 01:58:28,352
I don't know
what we'd have done.

851
01:58:28,478 --> 01:58:30,271
Not at all.

852
01:58:30,396 --> 01:58:34,150
How much good was our help
if we couldn't keep you here?

853
01:58:34,275 --> 01:58:37,236
That's not your fault.
It's our fate.

854
01:58:37,445 --> 01:58:42,283
Other people live
happy and peaceful lives here.

855
01:58:42,658 --> 01:58:47,121
Well, I hope you're happy
in your new home.

856
01:58:47,246 --> 01:58:48,831
<i>Sarbajaya?</i>

857
01:58:48,956 --> 01:58:50,458
Come in.

858
01:58:52,460 --> 01:58:55,797
You can sit on this.
- No need for that.

859
01:58:56,631 --> 01:58:59,050
These mangoes fell down
in the storm.

860
01:58:59,175 --> 01:59:01,969
I thought you could use them
for your trip.

861
01:59:02,094 --> 01:59:05,097
- You went to all that trouble?
- It's nothing.

862
01:59:05,264 --> 01:59:07,809
I've never given you anything.

863
01:59:07,975 --> 01:59:12,855
What are a few mangoes?
So you're really leaving tomorrow?

864
01:59:13,189 --> 01:59:14,315
Yes.

865
01:59:14,649 --> 01:59:17,819
You're probably angry
I didn't mention it before.

866
01:59:17,944 --> 01:59:20,029
Why should I be angry?

867
01:59:20,196 --> 01:59:23,866
I was very happy for you
when I heard.

868
01:59:24,951 --> 01:59:29,997
Rotting away in one place
year after year

869
01:59:30,122 --> 01:59:32,500
does no one any good.

870
01:59:33,251 --> 01:59:35,837
It makes a person
petty and mean.

871
01:59:36,003 --> 01:59:38,631
That's what it's done to me.

872
01:59:41,342 --> 01:59:44,846
Perhaps I'll go
on a pilgrimage to Chandranath.

873
01:59:44,971 --> 01:59:47,181
I'll see what my husband says.

874
01:59:47,431 --> 01:59:49,016
Khoka!

875
01:59:59,151 --> 02:00:02,446
Don't trouble yourself
on our account.

876
02:00:02,613 --> 02:00:04,824
Please sit down.

877
02:00:16,711 --> 02:00:19,380
I've been confined to bed

878
02:00:19,505 --> 02:00:22,341
for a month and a half
from indigestion,

879
02:00:22,717 --> 02:00:26,053
so I couldn't come see you.

880
02:00:27,054 --> 02:00:29,765
Chakravarti tells me...

881
02:00:31,058 --> 02:00:34,270
you're moving to Benares.
- That's right.

882
02:00:34,562 --> 02:00:37,356
We're leaving tomorrow at dawn.

883
02:00:40,151 --> 02:00:42,486
You're leaving tomorrow?

884
02:00:46,657 --> 02:00:48,451
Harihar...

885
02:00:49,201 --> 02:00:51,621
are you doing the right thing?

886
02:00:52,121 --> 02:00:54,832
You're Rajkeshto's son,

887
02:00:55,166 --> 02:00:57,752
Tarkalankar's grandson.

888
02:00:58,127 --> 02:01:01,422
Your family has lived here
for three generations.

889
02:01:01,756 --> 02:01:04,550
We village elders
are still around.

890
02:01:04,717 --> 02:01:08,346
You could have
discussed it with us.

891
02:01:08,471 --> 02:01:10,932
What good
would that have done?

892
02:01:11,307 --> 02:01:13,267
Look at the house.

893
02:01:13,434 --> 02:01:16,187
I have no means to repair it.

894
02:01:16,437 --> 02:01:20,274
Perhaps with your help
I'd have raised some money,

895
02:01:20,858 --> 02:01:23,319
but how long can this go on?

896
02:01:23,444 --> 02:01:27,073
It's been a long time —
almost 15 years —

897
02:01:27,448 --> 02:01:30,368
and I still haven't
paid back your loans.

898
02:01:30,493 --> 02:01:34,664
Maybe I can pay them off
by selling a few of these things.

899
02:01:34,789 --> 02:01:37,291
All my plans came to nothing.

900
02:01:38,626 --> 02:01:40,753
I wanted to be a writer.

901
02:01:41,170 --> 02:01:43,464
Look at these.
Eaten up by woodworms.

902
02:01:43,756 --> 02:01:46,884
I hoped to educate my boy.
That came to nothing.

903
02:01:47,009 --> 02:01:50,429
And my little girl slipped away.

904
02:01:53,057 --> 02:01:57,687
It's best to go. Sometimes one
must leave one's ancestral home.

905
02:01:57,812 --> 02:02:00,731
At least in the city
I can scrape by

906
02:02:01,190 --> 02:02:04,193
reciting scriptures and narrating tales.

907
02:02:04,902 --> 02:02:09,073
But you'll be back sometime, right?

908
02:04:49,775 --> 02:04:54,530
THE END
