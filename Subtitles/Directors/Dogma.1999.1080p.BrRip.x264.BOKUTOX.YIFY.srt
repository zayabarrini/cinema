2
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:09,420
Ladies and gentlemen, the driving
force behind Catholicism Wow!

3
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:11,255
...Cardinal Glick.

4
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:19,347
Thank you, thank you.

5
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:21,307
Now, we all know
how the majority...

6
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:23,559
...and the media in this country...

7
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:25,853
...view the Catholic Church.

8
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:29,148
They think of us as a passé,
archaic institution.

9
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:32,401
People find the Bible obtuse...

10
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:33,986
...even hokey.

11
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,155
Now, in an effort
to disprove all that...

12
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:39,909
...the Church has appointed this year
as a time of renewal...

13
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:42,036
...both of faith and of style.

14
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:45,081
For example, the crucifix.

15
00:02:45,249 --> 00:02:47,875
While it has been a time-honored
symbol of our faith...

16
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:50,920
...Holy Mother Church
has decided to retire...

17
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:52,588
...this highly recognizable...

18
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:55,049
...yet wholly depressing image...

19
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:57,260
...of our Lord, crucified.

20
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:00,680
Christ didn't come to Earth
to give us the willies.

21
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:02,598
He came to help us out.

22
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:06,394
He was a booster, and it's
with that take on our Lord in mind...

23
00:03:06,562 --> 00:03:09,272
...that we've come up with a new,
more inspiring sigil.

24
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:13,276
So it is with great pleasure
that I present you with the first...

25
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,945
...of many revamps
the Catholicism Wow! campaign...

26
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:19,532
...will unveil over the next year,
I give you...

27
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,825
..."The Buddy Christ."

28
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:33,462
That's not the sanctioned term
we're using for the symbol.

29
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,048
Just something we've been
kicking around the office.

30
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,592
But look at it.

31
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,552
Doesn't it pop?

32
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,262
Buddy Christ.

33
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,389
Well, there you have it.

34
00:03:43,483 --> 00:03:45,275
Let me get this straight.

35
00:03:45,443 --> 00:03:48,570
You don't believe in God
because of Alice in Wonderland?

36
00:03:48,738 --> 00:03:50,072
No, Through the Looking Glass.

37
00:03:51,449 --> 00:03:53,242
That poem,
"The Walrus and the Carpenter"...

38
00:03:53,409 --> 00:03:55,327
...is an indictment
of organized religion.

39
00:03:55,495 --> 00:03:57,579
The Walrus, with his girth
and good nature...

40
00:03:57,747 --> 00:03:59,707
...he obviously represents
either Buddha...

41
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:02,669
...or with his tusks, the Hindu
elephant god, Lord Ganesha.

42
00:04:02,837 --> 00:04:04,754
That takes care
of your Eastern religions.

43
00:04:04,922 --> 00:04:07,590
Now, the Carpenter,
an obvious reference to Jesus Christ...

44
00:04:07,758 --> 00:04:10,844
...who was raised a carpenter's son,
represents Western religions.

45
00:04:12,179 --> 00:04:13,763
Now, in the poem,
what do they do?

46
00:04:13,931 --> 00:04:16,432
They dupe all these oysters
into following them...

47
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,270
...then proceed to shuck and devour
the helpless creatures en masse.

48
00:04:20,437 --> 00:04:23,273
I don't know what that says to you,
but to me it says...

49
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,110
...that following these faiths
based on mythological figures...

50
00:04:27,278 --> 00:04:28,903
...destroys one's inner being.

51
00:04:30,239 --> 00:04:32,115
Organized religion destroys
who we are...

52
00:04:32,283 --> 00:04:35,118
...by inhibiting our actions,
by inhibiting our decisions...

53
00:04:35,286 --> 00:04:38,413
...out of fear of some
intangible parent figure...

54
00:04:38,581 --> 00:04:41,457
...who shakes a finger at us
from thousands of years ago...

55
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:45,461
...and says, "Do it...
Do it and I'll fucking spank you!"

56
00:04:45,629 --> 00:04:46,880
Oh, Jesus!

57
00:04:47,047 --> 00:04:50,592
The way you put it, I've never really
thought about it like that before.

58
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,970
What have I been doing
with my life?

59
00:04:54,972 --> 00:04:57,473
- What am I...?
- Yeah, I know.

60
00:04:57,641 --> 00:04:59,309
Listen, my advice to you...

61
00:04:59,476 --> 00:05:02,103
...take this money you've
collected for your parish...

62
00:05:02,271 --> 00:05:05,231
...go get yourself a nice dress,
you know? Fix yourself up.

63
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:08,610
Find some man, some woman, you
can connect with, even for a moment...

64
00:05:08,777 --> 00:05:12,530
...because that's really all life is,
Sister, it's a series of moments.

65
00:05:12,698 --> 00:05:14,824
Why don't you seize yours?

66
00:05:18,038 --> 00:05:20,664
Attagirl. Attagirl.

67
00:05:27,339 --> 00:05:29,340
You know, here's what
I don't get about you.

68
00:05:29,507 --> 00:05:32,217
You know for a fact
that there is a God.

69
00:05:32,385 --> 00:05:35,095
You've been in his presence.
He's spoken to you personally.

70
00:05:35,263 --> 00:05:38,515
- Yet I heard you claim to be atheist.
- I like to fuck with the clergy.

71
00:05:38,683 --> 00:05:41,936
I just love it. I love to keep
those guys on their toes.

72
00:05:42,103 --> 00:05:43,771
Here's what I don't get about you.

73
00:05:43,939 --> 00:05:46,774
Why do you feel the need
to come to this place all the time?

74
00:05:46,942 --> 00:05:49,360
My friend, because
this is humanity at its best.

75
00:05:49,527 --> 00:05:50,569
Look at them.

76
00:05:50,737 --> 00:05:54,531
All that anger, all that mistrust,
all that unhappiness...

77
00:05:54,699 --> 00:05:58,535
...forgotten for that one perfect moment
when they get off the plane.

78
00:05:58,703 --> 00:05:59,870
See those two?

79
00:06:00,038 --> 00:06:03,290
That guy doesn't know that the girl
cheated on him while she was away.

80
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:05,209
- She did?
- Twice.

81
00:06:05,377 --> 00:06:07,461
- Nice.
- But it doesn't matter right now...

82
00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:10,881
...because they're just both so relieved
to be with one another.

83
00:06:11,591 --> 00:06:12,841
I like that.

84
00:06:13,009 --> 00:06:15,219
I wish they could all
feel that way more often.

85
00:06:15,387 --> 00:06:18,389
Is this why I had to come down here
and miss my fucking cartoons?

86
00:06:18,556 --> 00:06:20,975
You call me, you tell me
it's important, you know?

87
00:06:21,142 --> 00:06:24,269
What, to share in your half-assed
obsession with Hallmark moments?

88
00:06:24,437 --> 00:06:26,563
We're going home.

89
00:06:26,731 --> 00:06:28,983
Somebody sent us this in the mail.

90
00:06:33,656 --> 00:06:36,908
Take it and quit leering at me.
People will think I broke up with you.

91
00:06:37,076 --> 00:06:40,370
- You did just say we're going home?
- Read.

92
00:06:40,538 --> 00:06:44,416
"Cardinal Glick Cuts Ribbon On
Catholicism Wow! Campaign."

93
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:46,042
And?

94
00:06:47,086 --> 00:06:49,754
You have to keep reading.

95
00:06:49,922 --> 00:06:52,007
"The rededication of
St. Michael's Church"...

96
00:06:52,174 --> 00:06:53,758
is the kickoff of
a new campaign...

97
00:06:53,926 --> 00:06:56,344
...which seeks to bring
Catholicism into the mainstream.

98
00:06:56,512 --> 00:06:58,763
With a papal sanction,
the archway entrance...

99
00:06:58,931 --> 00:07:01,433
...of the century-old Jersey Shore
house of worship...

100
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,935
...will serve as a passageway
of plenary indulgence...

101
00:07:04,103 --> 00:07:07,439
...a little-known Catholic belief
offering all that passes through it...

102
00:07:07,606 --> 00:07:09,274
...a morally clean slate.

103
00:07:09,442 --> 00:07:12,527
For Sunday News Brief,
I'm Grant Hicks.

104
00:07:12,695 --> 00:07:16,156
All I gotta do, I walk through the arch
thing, and then I can go back home?

105
00:07:16,323 --> 00:07:19,617
No. By walking through the archway,
all your sins are forgiven.

106
00:07:19,785 --> 00:07:22,370
- Then all we have to do is die.
- Die? I don't wanna die.

107
00:07:22,538 --> 00:07:26,166
- You rather hang around here?
- No. We don't know if we can die.

108
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:29,335
But what if we can and then
the arch thing doesn't work?

109
00:07:29,503 --> 00:07:31,087
What then, hell? Fuck that.

110
00:07:31,255 --> 00:07:33,214
It's impossible.
If we cut off our wings...

111
00:07:33,382 --> 00:07:36,718
...and transubstantiate to complete
human form, we become mortal.

112
00:07:36,886 --> 00:07:39,262
If we die with clean souls,
they can't keep us out.

113
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:42,474
We won't be angels anymore,
but at least we get to go home.

114
00:07:42,641 --> 00:07:45,852
- Who sent the paper?
- Who cares who sent the paper?

115
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:49,148
All that matters is that after
all these years, we found a loophole.

116
00:07:49,316 --> 00:07:50,816
He can't keep us out anymore.

117
00:07:50,984 --> 00:07:53,235
Once we're back in,
he'll just forgive and forget.

118
00:07:53,403 --> 00:07:57,198
But this thing, this is Church law.
It's not divine mandate.

119
00:07:57,365 --> 00:08:00,868
Church laws are fallible
because they're created by man.

120
00:08:01,036 --> 00:08:04,371
One of the last sacred promises
imparted to Peter, the first pope...

121
00:08:04,539 --> 00:08:08,000
...by the son of God
before he left was:

122
00:08:08,168 --> 00:08:09,835
"Whatever you hold true on Earth..."

123
00:08:10,003 --> 00:08:11,295
"I'll hold true in heaven."

124
00:08:11,463 --> 00:08:14,340
It's dogmatic law. If the Church
says it's so, God must adhere.

125
00:08:14,508 --> 00:08:16,133
This thing has a papal sanction...

126
00:08:16,301 --> 00:08:19,178
Let it never be said your
anal retentive attention to detail...

127
00:08:19,346 --> 00:08:20,971
...never yielded positive results.

128
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:23,641
You can't be anal retentive
if you don't have an anus.

129
00:08:23,809 --> 00:08:25,684
Outstanding work!

130
00:08:25,852 --> 00:08:28,604
There's just one thing
I think we gotta do before we leave.

131
00:08:28,772 --> 00:08:30,773
This will help us get back
on his good side.

132
00:08:30,941 --> 00:08:32,024
What?

133
00:08:32,192 --> 00:08:34,985
I've been dreaming about this
for five years. Read that.

134
00:08:35,153 --> 00:08:36,529
"Mooby, the Golden Calf.

135
00:08:36,696 --> 00:08:39,365
Creating an empire
out of simplicity."

136
00:08:39,533 --> 00:08:41,325
I wanna hit them.

137
00:08:41,493 --> 00:08:43,911
You really are
Just a simple creature.

138
00:08:44,079 --> 00:08:46,455
We find a way back
and you wanna jeopardize that...

139
00:08:46,623 --> 00:08:48,666
...because you yearn
for the good old days.

140
00:08:48,834 --> 00:08:52,211
What better way to repent than by
resuming the position I once denied...

141
00:08:52,379 --> 00:08:53,754
...thanks to you?

142
00:08:53,922 --> 00:08:56,924
I don't think a killing spree
is gonna make things better for us.

143
00:08:57,092 --> 00:08:59,718
Killing spree?
I'm talking about divine justice here.

144
00:08:59,886 --> 00:09:03,265
I'm talking about raining down fire
and brimstone, punishing the wicked.

145
00:09:03,432 --> 00:09:05,976
He's all about that.
I know he'd want this done.

146
00:09:06,144 --> 00:09:08,645
There hasn't been an Angel of Death
since you quit.

147
00:09:08,813 --> 00:09:10,397
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

148
00:09:10,565 --> 00:09:13,358
And besides, what if you're wrong,
like you always are?

149
00:09:13,526 --> 00:09:16,069
If I'm wrong, which I'm not,
it's not gonna matter.

150
00:09:16,237 --> 00:09:18,405
We're gonna pass through
your arch thing anyway.

151
00:09:18,573 --> 00:09:21,366
We're gonna be forgiven.
No harm, no foul.

152
00:09:21,534 --> 00:09:25,078
Well, he does hate competition.
I will say that.

153
00:09:25,246 --> 00:09:27,414
And your Mooby certainly falls
under that heading.

154
00:09:27,582 --> 00:09:29,541
Where is this church
we have to go to?

155
00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:32,919
New Jersey. Rededication ceremony
is in four days.

156
00:09:33,087 --> 00:09:34,921
Last four days on Earth?

157
00:09:35,089 --> 00:09:37,299
If I had a dick, I'd go get laid.

158
00:09:37,466 --> 00:09:39,593
- We can do the next best thing.
- What's that?

159
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,511
Let's kill people.

160
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:43,263
Oh, not you.

161
00:09:50,271 --> 00:09:52,814
The Illinois Chapter
of the Right to Life Foundation...

162
00:09:54,192 --> 00:09:56,401
...will be holding its
biannual softball game...

163
00:09:56,569 --> 00:10:00,071
...against the Cook County
Pro-Choice League next Sunday at 2.

164
00:10:00,239 --> 00:10:02,490
Today's second collection
will be donated...

165
00:10:02,658 --> 00:10:05,410
...to the John Doe Jersey Life Fund.

166
00:10:05,578 --> 00:10:07,871
For those of you
who haven't followed the news...

167
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:10,874
...an unidentified homeless man
who was accosted...

168
00:10:11,042 --> 00:10:14,211
...and severely beaten at
the New Jersey Shore last Tuesday...

169
00:10:14,378 --> 00:10:18,466
...lies in critical but stable condition
in one of that area's hospitals.

170
00:10:18,634 --> 00:10:20,301
He lacks identification...

171
00:10:20,469 --> 00:10:23,888
...and police have had no luck
tracking down any possible family.

172
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:28,309
The archbishop of the Trenton diocese
has disputed the state's decision...

173
00:10:28,477 --> 00:10:31,646
...to remove the indigent man
from life-support systems...

174
00:10:31,813 --> 00:10:34,023
...asking that Catholics
all over the country...

175
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,652
...join in this protest
against euthanasia.

176
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:41,155
Well, now please rise
for the recession of faith.

177
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,662
We believe in one god,
the Father Almighty...

178
00:10:47,829 --> 00:10:49,330
...maker of heaven and earth.

179
00:10:49,498 --> 00:10:52,500
We believe in Jesus Christ,
his only son, our Lord...

180
00:10:54,127 --> 00:10:55,378
Hey, choose life!

181
00:10:55,545 --> 00:10:58,923
You're gonna burn in hell,
you fucking baby killer!

182
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:01,008
Holy shit, it's the pope.

183
00:11:01,176 --> 00:11:02,260
Where?

184
00:11:02,427 --> 00:11:03,678
What are you talking about?

185
00:11:13,021 --> 00:11:16,649
Jesus. You're a Catholic.
Can't you talk to them?

186
00:11:16,817 --> 00:11:18,818
They hate me more than you,
no doubt.

187
00:11:18,986 --> 00:11:21,779
You have an excuse. You're Jewish.
You don't know any better.

188
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:25,324
We already used that excuse
when we killed Christ.

189
00:11:25,492 --> 00:11:27,535
Where were you yesterday?
We went to brunch.

190
00:11:27,703 --> 00:11:28,995
I went to church.

191
00:11:29,162 --> 00:11:30,913
That still kills me, you and church.

192
00:11:31,081 --> 00:11:34,543
If only they knew your tithing came
from a Planned Parenthood check.

193
00:11:34,711 --> 00:11:37,254
I don't know why I still go, Liz.

194
00:11:38,381 --> 00:11:41,925
I can remember going to church
when I was young and being moved.

195
00:11:42,093 --> 00:11:45,304
Now I sit there every Sunday
and I feel nothing.

196
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:47,806
I don't think I have any faith left.

197
00:11:49,058 --> 00:11:52,019
Remember that seminary student
I tried to set you up with?

198
00:11:53,563 --> 00:11:57,482
The 20-year-old. The one I could
have babysat for in high school.

199
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,860
Well, the point is,
he told me something.

200
00:12:00,028 --> 00:12:02,487
He said that faith
is like a glass of water.

201
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:05,574
When you're young, the glass is little,
so it's easy to fill.

202
00:12:05,742 --> 00:12:07,576
As you get older,
the glass gets bigger.

203
00:12:07,744 --> 00:12:09,661
The same amount of liquid
doesn't fill it.

204
00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:12,581
But periodically
the glass has to be refilled.

205
00:12:12,749 --> 00:12:14,541
You're suggesting I need
to get filled?

206
00:12:14,709 --> 00:12:15,834
In more ways than one.

207
00:12:16,002 --> 00:12:17,711
You need to get laid,
Bethany Sloane.

208
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:20,339
You need a man,
if only for 10 minutes.

209
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:23,216
My experience is that
the average male is never a man...

210
00:12:23,384 --> 00:12:25,719
...not even for 10 minutes
in his entire life span.

211
00:12:25,887 --> 00:12:28,722
That sounds militant.
You thinking ofjoining the other side?

212
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,724
Couldn't do it.
Women are insane.

213
00:12:30,892 --> 00:12:33,935
Then you need to go back to church
and ask God for a third option.

214
00:12:34,103 --> 00:12:35,937
I think God is dead.

215
00:12:36,105 --> 00:12:38,440
The sign of a true Catholic.

216
00:12:49,119 --> 00:12:52,288
Good afternoon, Mrs. Reynolds.

217
00:12:52,456 --> 00:12:54,082
I'm from the EPA.

218
00:12:55,209 --> 00:12:58,002
We're checking on possible
Freon leaks.

219
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:00,463
Tell me,
do you have air conditioning?

220
00:13:00,631 --> 00:13:02,256
Yes, we have central air.

221
00:13:02,424 --> 00:13:03,925
In every room?

222
00:13:04,093 --> 00:13:05,802
Except the bathroom. Why?

223
00:13:05,969 --> 00:13:07,887
Well, you know
what that means, don't you?

224
00:13:19,274 --> 00:13:20,858
Move.

225
00:13:27,491 --> 00:13:31,119
No pleasure, no rapture,
no exquisite sin greater...

226
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:34,122
...than central air.

227
00:13:34,832 --> 00:13:36,999
Pick that up.

228
00:13:40,087 --> 00:13:44,298
This will be the base of operations
from here on in.

229
00:13:44,466 --> 00:13:47,260
Now, if I remember
the protocol correctly...

230
00:13:47,428 --> 00:13:52,181
...the powers will attempt
to contact the last scion.

231
00:13:52,349 --> 00:13:54,392
I need you three...

232
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,645
...to shuffle her loose
the mortal coil.

233
00:14:01,775 --> 00:14:02,817
Go.

234
00:14:37,228 --> 00:14:39,480
Behold the Metatron!

235
00:14:39,647 --> 00:14:42,316
Herald of the Almighty
and voice of the one true god!

236
00:14:43,109 --> 00:14:45,068
Behold the Metatron!

237
00:14:45,236 --> 00:14:49,239
Herald of the Almighty
and voice of the one true god!

238
00:14:49,407 --> 00:14:50,616
Behold the Metatron!

239
00:14:50,783 --> 00:14:54,411
Herald of the Almighty
and voice of the one true...

240
00:15:05,757 --> 00:15:08,717
Sweet Jesus!
Do you have to use the whole can?

241
00:15:08,885 --> 00:15:11,762
Who the fuck are you and what
the fuck are you doing in my room?

242
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:14,681
I'm soaked and she's
the one that's surly. That's rich.

243
00:15:14,849 --> 00:15:16,683
Stubbed my fucking...

244
00:15:16,851 --> 00:15:19,102
Get the fuck out of here, now!

245
00:15:19,562 --> 00:15:21,773
Or you'll do what exactly?

246
00:15:21,941 --> 00:15:24,108
Hit me with that fish?

247
00:15:29,114 --> 00:15:31,950
Now, just sit down on the bed
and shut up.

248
00:15:32,117 --> 00:15:34,619
Jesus wept!

249
00:15:34,787 --> 00:15:36,454
Look at my suit.

250
00:15:38,207 --> 00:15:40,416
Take what you want,
but don't kill or rape me.

251
00:15:40,584 --> 00:15:44,879
Give over! I couldn't rape you
if I wanted to. Angels are ill-equipped.

252
00:15:47,591 --> 00:15:48,633
See?

253
00:15:51,262 --> 00:15:54,055
I'm as anatomically impaired
as a Ken doll.

254
00:15:55,266 --> 00:15:57,308
Make yourself useful
and give me that towel.

255
00:15:58,435 --> 00:16:00,770
Honestly, you bottom-feeders
and your arrogance.

256
00:16:00,938 --> 00:16:03,606
You think everybody's just trying
to get in your knickers.

257
00:16:04,024 --> 00:16:05,275
What are you?

258
00:16:05,442 --> 00:16:07,318
I'm pissed off is what I am.

259
00:16:07,486 --> 00:16:11,447
Do you drench everyone who comes in
here with flame-retardant chemicals?

260
00:16:11,615 --> 00:16:14,075
No wonder you're single.

261
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:20,331
Stand back.

262
00:16:29,341 --> 00:16:31,009
As I was saying...

263
00:16:31,594 --> 00:16:34,304
...prior to your
fire-fighting episode...

264
00:16:35,014 --> 00:16:37,850
...I am the Metatron.

265
00:16:41,396 --> 00:16:43,355
Don't tell me the name
doesn't ring a bell.

266
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,609
You people.

267
00:16:47,402 --> 00:16:50,863
If there isn't a movie about it,
it's not worth knowing, is it?

268
00:16:51,823 --> 00:16:53,866
I am a seraphim.

269
00:16:55,452 --> 00:16:58,537
The highest choir of angels.

270
00:16:59,998 --> 00:17:01,832
You do know what an angel is,
don't you?

271
00:17:04,878 --> 00:17:07,463
Metatron acts as the voice of God.

272
00:17:07,631 --> 00:17:11,759
Any occasion when some yahoo
claims that God has spoken to them...

273
00:17:11,926 --> 00:17:13,552
...they're speaking to me.

274
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,888
Or they're talking to themselves.

275
00:17:18,058 --> 00:17:20,059
Why doesn't God speak for himself?

276
00:17:20,977 --> 00:17:24,271
Glad you decided to join
the conversation. To answer that...

277
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:27,775
...human beings have neither the aural
nor the psychological capacity...

278
00:17:27,942 --> 00:17:32,071
...to withstand the awesome power
of God's true voice.

279
00:17:32,238 --> 00:17:35,658
Were you to hear it, your mind would
cave in and your heart would explode.

280
00:17:35,825 --> 00:17:38,577
We went through five Adams
before we figured that one out.

281
00:17:39,663 --> 00:17:42,498
Well, how do I know
you're an angel?

282
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:47,503
What, aside from the fiery entrance
and the expansive wingspan?

283
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:51,591
You want more proof?

284
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:53,301
Fine.

285
00:17:53,469 --> 00:17:54,594
How about tequila?

286
00:18:01,936 --> 00:18:03,269
Where the hell are we?

287
00:18:03,437 --> 00:18:05,814
Only place you can go
for a good tequila.

288
00:18:05,981 --> 00:18:09,067
Dos tequilas, por favor,
and an empty glass.

289
00:18:11,112 --> 00:18:12,779
We're in Mexico?

290
00:18:12,947 --> 00:18:15,448
Actually, we're in the franchised
Mexican eatery...

291
00:18:15,616 --> 00:18:17,617
...down the street
from your apartment...

292
00:18:17,785 --> 00:18:19,536
...but it's impressive nonetheless.

293
00:18:20,121 --> 00:18:22,205
You don't mind I lost the wings,
do you?

294
00:18:22,373 --> 00:18:24,290
I'm trying to keep our profile low.

295
00:18:24,792 --> 00:18:26,126
What do you want with me?

296
00:18:28,754 --> 00:18:32,632
I am to charge you
with a holy crusade.

297
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,969
For the record,
I work in an abortion clinic.

298
00:18:36,137 --> 00:18:38,388
Noah was a drunk.
Look what he accomplished.

299
00:18:38,556 --> 00:18:40,432
And no one's asking you
to build an ark.

300
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:42,434
All you gotta do is go
to New Jersey...

301
00:18:42,601 --> 00:18:45,061
...and visit a small church
on a very important day.

302
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:50,817
New Jersey?

303
00:18:52,069 --> 00:18:54,112
That doesn't sound like
much of a crusade.

304
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,656
Aside from the fine print,
that's it.

305
00:18:56,824 --> 00:18:58,825
What's the fine print?

306
00:18:59,744 --> 00:19:02,829
Stop a couple angels from entering
and thus negating all existence.

307
00:19:02,997 --> 00:19:05,123
Wait, wait, wait. Repeat that.

308
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:08,377
Stop a couple of angels
from entering...

309
00:19:08,545 --> 00:19:11,505
...and thus negating all existence.

310
00:19:11,673 --> 00:19:14,008
I hate it when people
need it spelled out for them.

311
00:19:14,176 --> 00:19:15,968
You might want to clarify that.

312
00:19:17,179 --> 00:19:21,348
Back in the old days,
God was vengeful and hot-tempered.

313
00:19:21,516 --> 00:19:23,517
And his wrath was bore...

314
00:19:23,685 --> 00:19:26,854
...by the Angel of Death,
name of Loki.

315
00:19:27,022 --> 00:19:29,106
When Sodom and Gomorrah
was destroyed...

316
00:19:29,274 --> 00:19:30,691
...that was Loki.

317
00:19:30,859 --> 00:19:34,779
When the waters wiped out everything
except Noah and his menagerie...

318
00:19:34,946 --> 00:19:37,615
...that was Loki.
And he was good at what he did.

319
00:19:38,366 --> 00:19:42,495
But one day he refused to
bear God's wrath any longer.

320
00:19:43,205 --> 00:19:45,956
- Why?
- He listened to his friend...

321
00:19:46,124 --> 00:19:48,209
...a Grigori
by the name of Bartleby.

322
00:19:48,376 --> 00:19:49,376
Grigori?

323
00:19:49,544 --> 00:19:52,671
One of the choirs of angels.
They're called Watchers.

324
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:54,215
Guess what they do.

325
00:19:54,382 --> 00:19:58,719
So one day, Loki's wiping out
all the firstborn of Egypt...

326
00:19:59,179 --> 00:20:01,305
The Tenth Plague.

327
00:20:01,473 --> 00:20:03,974
Tell a person you're the Metatron,
they stare blankly.

328
00:20:04,142 --> 00:20:06,268
Mention something in
a Charlton Heston movie...

329
00:20:06,436 --> 00:20:08,562
...and suddenly everybody's
a theology scholar.

330
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:10,564
May I continue uninterrupted?

331
00:20:10,732 --> 00:20:12,691
Once he's done with the firstborn...

332
00:20:12,859 --> 00:20:17,446
...Loki takes his friend Bartleby out
for a post-slaughter drink.

333
00:20:17,614 --> 00:20:19,865
And over many rounds...

334
00:20:20,033 --> 00:20:22,076
...they get into
this discussion about...

335
00:20:22,244 --> 00:20:24,079
...whether murder
in God's name is okay.

336
00:20:24,247 --> 00:20:25,497
And in the end...

337
00:20:25,665 --> 00:20:29,543
...Bartleby convinces Loki
to quit his position...

338
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:31,920
...and take one which doesn't
involve slaughter.

339
00:20:32,088 --> 00:20:33,588
So...

340
00:20:35,091 --> 00:20:37,425
...very inebriated...

341
00:20:37,593 --> 00:20:40,136
...Loki tells God he quits...

342
00:20:40,304 --> 00:20:42,514
...throws down his fiery sword...

343
00:20:42,682 --> 00:20:44,558
...and gives him the finger.

344
00:20:44,725 --> 00:20:47,769
Which ruins it for the rest of us
because from that day forward...

345
00:20:47,937 --> 00:20:50,939
...God decreed that angels
could no longer imbibe alcohol.

346
00:20:51,107 --> 00:20:52,524
Hence all the spitting.

347
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:55,026
So for their insolence...

348
00:20:55,194 --> 00:20:58,029
...God decreed that neither Loki
nor Bartleby...

349
00:20:58,197 --> 00:21:00,740
...would ever be allowed
back into Paradise.

350
00:21:00,908 --> 00:21:02,617
- Were they sent to hell?
- Worse.

351
00:21:02,994 --> 00:21:04,619
Wisconsin...

352
00:21:04,787 --> 00:21:07,414
...for the entire span
of human history.

353
00:21:07,582 --> 00:21:11,042
And when the world ends, they'll have
to sit outside the gates for eternity.

354
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:12,961
And this has what to do with me?

355
00:21:13,129 --> 00:21:17,507
Someone has clued them in
to a loophole in Catholic dogma...

356
00:21:17,675 --> 00:21:20,218
...that would allow them
to reenter heaven.

357
00:21:20,386 --> 00:21:22,971
So what? They beat the system.
Good for them.

358
00:21:23,139 --> 00:21:24,973
It's not that simple.

359
00:21:25,141 --> 00:21:29,519
If they get in, they will have
reversed God's decree.

360
00:21:30,855 --> 00:21:34,149
Now listen closely because
this bit's very important.

361
00:21:34,984 --> 00:21:38,946
Existence in all its form
and splendor...

362
00:21:39,114 --> 00:21:42,658
...functions solely on one principle:

363
00:21:42,826 --> 00:21:45,786
God is infallible.

364
00:21:45,954 --> 00:21:47,788
To prove him wrong...

365
00:21:47,956 --> 00:21:50,833
...would undo reality
and everything that is.

366
00:21:51,001 --> 00:21:53,794
Up would become down,
black would become white.

367
00:21:53,962 --> 00:21:56,839
Existence would
become nothingness.

368
00:21:57,007 --> 00:21:58,549
In essence...

369
00:21:59,635 --> 00:22:02,094
...if they're allowed to enter
that church...

370
00:22:03,931 --> 00:22:06,849
...they'll unmake the world.

371
00:22:07,309 --> 00:22:09,852
If this is so major,
why are you talking to me?

372
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,854
Why doesn't God
do something about it?

373
00:22:12,022 --> 00:22:15,858
He could. But he'd rather see you
take care of this one personally.

374
00:22:16,443 --> 00:22:17,610
Why me?

375
00:22:18,195 --> 00:22:19,987
Because of who you are.

376
00:22:20,155 --> 00:22:21,864
And who am I?

377
00:22:22,366 --> 00:22:24,075
The girl in the P.J.'s!

378
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:27,870
Don't ask so many questions.
Just serve your purpose.

379
00:22:28,038 --> 00:22:29,997
I'm gonna have to pass.

380
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:32,041
I beg your pardon?

381
00:22:32,209 --> 00:22:36,545
When some quiet little infection
destroyed my uterus, where was God?

382
00:22:36,713 --> 00:22:38,214
When my husband decided...

383
00:22:38,382 --> 00:22:40,967
...he couldn't be with a wife
who couldn't bear children...

384
00:22:41,134 --> 00:22:42,176
...where was God?

385
00:22:44,721 --> 00:22:45,846
To hell with him.

386
00:22:46,014 --> 00:22:50,059
Don't allow eons of history and life
to get blinked out of being...

387
00:22:50,227 --> 00:22:52,478
...just because of a grudge
against your creator.

388
00:22:52,646 --> 00:22:54,982
So you lost the ability
to make life.

389
00:22:55,149 --> 00:22:58,568
You're being offered the chance
to play mother to the world...

390
00:22:58,736 --> 00:23:00,904
...by acting like one
and protecting it.

391
00:23:01,072 --> 00:23:02,990
Saving it!

392
00:23:05,535 --> 00:23:07,452
But I can't make you.

393
00:23:08,579 --> 00:23:11,123
However, if you should decide
to stop being selfish...

394
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:13,709
...and accept your responsibility...

395
00:23:13,876 --> 00:23:15,669
...you won't be alone.

396
00:23:15,837 --> 00:23:17,087
You'll have support.

397
00:23:17,255 --> 00:23:19,256
What? More angels?

398
00:23:19,424 --> 00:23:21,008
Prophets.

399
00:23:22,927 --> 00:23:25,971
In a manner of speaking.
Two of them.

400
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:30,976
The one who speaks...

401
00:23:31,144 --> 00:23:34,479
And he will, at great length,
whether you want him to or not.

402
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:36,732
- will make mention of himself
as a prophet.

403
00:23:36,899 --> 00:23:38,275
The other one...

404
00:23:39,318 --> 00:23:41,028
...well, he's the quiet type.

405
00:23:41,195 --> 00:23:42,362
Look, I've gotta go.

406
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:44,781
Remember, we're working
in a time frame here.

407
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,618
Hey.

408
00:23:49,287 --> 00:23:51,455
- What's he like?
- God?

409
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:55,167
Lonely...

410
00:23:55,334 --> 00:23:57,127
...but funny.

411
00:23:57,295 --> 00:23:59,212
He's got a great sense of humor.

412
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,381
Sex, for example.
There's nothing funnier...

413
00:24:01,549 --> 00:24:04,134
...than the ridiculous faces
you people make mid-coitus.

414
00:24:04,302 --> 00:24:06,136
Sex is a joke in heaven?

415
00:24:06,304 --> 00:24:10,016
The way I understand it,
it's mostly a joke down here too.

416
00:24:10,184 --> 00:24:11,392
I'll see you.

417
00:26:14,517 --> 00:26:17,269
Snootch to
the motherfucking nootch!

418
00:26:53,474 --> 00:26:56,851
Go back to your paper routes,
you Mighty Duck Fucks!

419
00:26:57,978 --> 00:27:00,396
Snoogans.
Did you see that shit, man?

420
00:27:00,564 --> 00:27:04,651
I know they were just kids, but we
kicked their fucking pubeless asses!

421
00:27:10,074 --> 00:27:12,450
I don't know what to say
or think, except...

422
00:27:12,618 --> 00:27:14,452
That you'll offer us sex
as a reward?

423
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:17,789
That I'd like to know
who they and you are.

424
00:27:17,957 --> 00:27:20,708
I'm Jay, and this is
my hetero life mate, Silent Bob.

425
00:27:20,876 --> 00:27:23,503
I don't know those kids,
but they would have kicked yours...

426
00:27:23,671 --> 00:27:26,339
...and lunchbox's asses
if I hadn't represented.

427
00:27:26,507 --> 00:27:29,217
Well, thanks for being
out here so late.

428
00:27:29,385 --> 00:27:31,511
Wait a minute. Are you protestors?

429
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,597
You mean those dickheads with signs
and pictures of dead babies?

430
00:27:34,765 --> 00:27:37,016
Shit, no!
Me and Silent Bob are pro-choice.

431
00:27:37,184 --> 00:27:39,143
A woman's body
is her own fucking business.

432
00:27:39,311 --> 00:27:41,187
But what are you doing
hanging around?

433
00:27:41,355 --> 00:27:43,314
We're here to pick up chicks.

434
00:27:44,108 --> 00:27:45,149
Excuse me?

435
00:27:45,317 --> 00:27:48,361
We figure abortion clinics are
a good place to meet loose women.

436
00:27:48,529 --> 00:27:51,197
Why else would they be here
unless they like to fuck?

437
00:27:52,157 --> 00:27:54,200
Right.

438
00:27:54,368 --> 00:27:57,037
Well, I should be going.
Thanks for the rescue.

439
00:27:57,205 --> 00:27:58,914
- I think.
- Wait a second.

440
00:27:59,082 --> 00:28:01,667
We just saved your ass,
and you're just gonna take off.

441
00:28:01,835 --> 00:28:02,876
What the shit is that?

442
00:28:03,044 --> 00:28:06,839
I had a weird night last night and
tonight's not shaping up to be better.

443
00:28:07,007 --> 00:28:09,883
I think I should go home,
take some Percosets and lay down.

444
00:28:11,303 --> 00:28:14,596
Now, how about that shit?
Fuck this town, man!

445
00:28:14,764 --> 00:28:17,391
I'm going back to Jersey
and starting the business again.

446
00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:21,228
I can kick the shit out of kids
in Red Bank and make myself a profit.

447
00:28:21,396 --> 00:28:23,814
Prophets. Two of them.

448
00:28:23,982 --> 00:28:25,691
You know what I'm saying,
Silent Bob?

449
00:28:25,859 --> 00:28:27,693
You gotta be kidding me.

450
00:28:27,861 --> 00:28:30,404
We call this piece "The Fecalator."

451
00:28:30,572 --> 00:28:33,115
One look at it and the target
shits him or herself.

452
00:28:33,283 --> 00:28:34,700
Try it on.

453
00:28:35,493 --> 00:28:37,870
It's a lot more compact
than the flaming sword...

454
00:28:38,038 --> 00:28:39,997
...but it's not nearly as impressive.

455
00:28:40,165 --> 00:28:43,375
It doesn't have that
"wrath of the Almighty" edge to it.

456
00:28:43,543 --> 00:28:47,588
How am I supposed to strike fear into
the hearts of the wicked with this?

457
00:28:47,756 --> 00:28:48,756
Look at this.

458
00:28:49,257 --> 00:28:53,510
Well, then, you know, don't use a gun.
Lay the place to waste like.

459
00:28:53,678 --> 00:28:56,513
Easy for you to say.
You get off light in a razing.

460
00:28:56,681 --> 00:28:58,891
You got to stand and read
at Sodom and Gomorrah.

461
00:28:59,059 --> 00:29:00,893
I had to do all the work.

462
00:29:01,061 --> 00:29:04,188
What work did you do?
You lit a few fires.

463
00:29:04,356 --> 00:29:06,899
I rained down sulfur, man.
There's a subtle difference.

464
00:29:07,067 --> 00:29:08,650
Okay, I'm sure.

465
00:29:08,818 --> 00:29:12,614
Fuck you, man. Any moron with
a pack of matches can set a fire.

466
00:29:12,782 --> 00:29:14,657
Raining down sulfur
is an endurance trial.

467
00:29:14,825 --> 00:29:17,535
Mass genocide is the most
exhausting activity one can do...

468
00:29:17,703 --> 00:29:19,204
...next to soccer.

469
00:29:20,623 --> 00:29:22,415
I'll take this one.

470
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:39,307
So, what's up? You have a friend for
Silent Bob, or you gonna do us both?

471
00:29:39,475 --> 00:29:41,768
If so, I'm first.
I hate sloppy seconds.

472
00:29:41,936 --> 00:29:43,895
You're a man of principle.

473
00:29:44,063 --> 00:29:47,607
Jersey's pretty far from McHenry.
May I ask what brought you here?

474
00:29:47,775 --> 00:29:50,151
Some fuck named John Hughes.

475
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:51,903
Sixteen Candles John Hughes?

476
00:29:52,822 --> 00:29:56,157
You know that guy too?
That fucking guy.

477
00:29:56,325 --> 00:29:58,993
He made this flick Sixteen Candles.
Not bad.

478
00:29:59,161 --> 00:30:01,079
There's tits in it, but no bush.

479
00:30:01,247 --> 00:30:03,998
But Ebert here don't give
a shit about that kind of thing...

480
00:30:04,166 --> 00:30:06,501
...because he's in love
with this John Hughes guy.

481
00:30:06,669 --> 00:30:08,753
He goes out and rents
every one of his movies.

482
00:30:08,921 --> 00:30:13,258
Fucking Breakfast Club, where stupid
kids actually show up for detention.

483
00:30:13,426 --> 00:30:17,137
Fucking Weird Science, where this
babe wants to undress and get down...

484
00:30:17,304 --> 00:30:20,348
...but, oh, no, she don't,
because it's a PG movie.

485
00:30:20,516 --> 00:30:24,602
And then Pretty in Pink, which I can't
watch with this tubby bitch anymore...

486
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:28,023
...because when the redhead
hooks up with her dream guy...

487
00:30:28,191 --> 00:30:31,652
...he starts sobbing like a little bitch
with a skinned knee and shit.

488
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:34,989
And there's nothing worse
than watching a fucking fat man weep.

489
00:30:35,157 --> 00:30:36,991
What exactly brought you
to Illlinois?

490
00:30:37,159 --> 00:30:40,953
All these movies take place in this
small town called Shermer, Illinois...

491
00:30:41,121 --> 00:30:45,166
...where all the honeys are top-shelf
but all the dudes are whiny pussies.

492
00:30:45,333 --> 00:30:48,210
Except for Judd Nelson.
He was fucking harsh.

493
00:30:48,378 --> 00:30:49,545
But best of all...

494
00:30:49,713 --> 00:30:51,755
...there was no one dealing, man.

495
00:30:51,923 --> 00:30:54,175
Then it hits me.
We could live like phat rats...

496
00:30:54,342 --> 00:30:56,886
...if we were the blunt connection
in Shermer, Illinois.

497
00:30:57,053 --> 00:30:59,889
So we collected some money
we were owed and caught a bus.

498
00:31:00,056 --> 00:31:03,058
But you know what the fuck
we found out when we got there?

499
00:31:03,226 --> 00:31:06,061
There is no Shermer in Illinois.

500
00:31:06,229 --> 00:31:08,063
Movies are fucking bullshit.

501
00:31:08,231 --> 00:31:09,732
When are you going
to New Jersey?

502
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,151
Jeez, this broad asks
a lot of questions.

503
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:15,404
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow.

504
00:31:15,572 --> 00:31:17,323
Yeah. So you do anal?

505
00:31:17,491 --> 00:31:19,909
Is it true chicks fart
if you blast them in the ass?

506
00:31:20,076 --> 00:31:21,911
I didn't ask you out for sex.

507
00:31:22,078 --> 00:31:23,954
I'll take head.

508
00:31:26,249 --> 00:31:29,919
This is gonna sound really bad. I can't
believe I'm even thinking about this...

509
00:31:32,547 --> 00:31:34,423
...but I think I should go with you.

510
00:31:34,591 --> 00:31:37,760
What, like steady?
You wanna be my girlfriend?

511
00:31:38,386 --> 00:31:41,514
All right, but Silent Bob gets
to live with us and you pay the rent.

512
00:31:41,681 --> 00:31:44,392
No. I wanna go with you
to New Jersey.

513
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,560
Really?

514
00:31:45,728 --> 00:31:47,729
You're going to
lead me somewhere.

515
00:31:47,897 --> 00:31:49,356
Me lead you?

516
00:31:49,524 --> 00:31:52,317
Lady, look at me. I don't even know
where I am half the time.

517
00:31:52,485 --> 00:31:55,570
If we're not gonna fuck, then what
the fuck did you ask us out for?

518
00:31:55,738 --> 00:31:59,741
Someone said I'd meet you and you'd
take me someplace I'm supposed to go.

519
00:31:59,909 --> 00:32:01,785
What the hell are
you babbling about?

520
00:32:01,953 --> 00:32:04,538
We saved your ass from
some angry fucking dwarves...

521
00:32:04,705 --> 00:32:08,416
...and now we're supposed to take you
somewhere as if we know where it is?

522
00:32:10,378 --> 00:32:12,087
Do you believe in God?

523
00:32:13,464 --> 00:32:16,758
Holy fuck! All the fine, immoral bitches
out in front of that place...

524
00:32:16,926 --> 00:32:18,343
...and we get the Jesus freak?

525
00:32:18,511 --> 00:32:20,136
- Let's get out of here.
- No, wait.

526
00:32:20,304 --> 00:32:21,930
- I'll scream rape.
- I can pay you.

527
00:32:22,932 --> 00:32:24,349
Pay?

528
00:32:27,019 --> 00:32:28,937
A hundred bucks
for being my guide.

529
00:32:29,105 --> 00:32:33,108
You were going to Jersey anyway.
All I'm asking is to tag along.

530
00:32:33,276 --> 00:32:36,653
I feel like Han Solo, you're Chewie,
and she's Ben Kenobi...

531
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:39,155
...and we're in that fucked-up bar!

532
00:32:39,323 --> 00:32:40,740
What about sex?

533
00:32:40,908 --> 00:32:42,158
No sex.

534
00:32:44,287 --> 00:32:48,081
Let's say we're caught in a situation
where we have five minutes left to live.

535
00:32:48,249 --> 00:32:51,668
A bomb or something's gonna go off.
Would you fuck us then?

536
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:53,795
In that highly unlikely situation?

537
00:32:57,091 --> 00:32:58,342
Yeah, sure.

538
00:32:58,719 --> 00:33:01,512
Yeah? She's a slut.

539
00:33:03,849 --> 00:33:05,433
All right.

540
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:08,936
But I get to drive.

541
00:33:18,113 --> 00:33:20,323
What gear are you in?

542
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:21,782
Gear?

543
00:33:30,792 --> 00:33:33,377
Well, what do I know
about shifting?

544
00:33:37,007 --> 00:33:38,674
Like I ever drove before.

545
00:33:43,013 --> 00:33:45,348
Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania...

546
00:33:45,515 --> 00:33:46,849
...New Jersey.

547
00:33:47,017 --> 00:33:48,934
Maybe you're wrong
on the slaughter thing.

548
00:33:49,102 --> 00:33:51,896
How can you be sure what incurs
the Lord's wrath these days?

549
00:33:52,064 --> 00:33:53,230
Times change.

550
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:57,026
I remember eating meat on a Friday
used to be a hell-worthy trespass.

551
00:33:57,194 --> 00:33:59,612
The major sins never change.

552
00:34:01,031 --> 00:34:03,449
And besides, I can spot
a commandment-breaker...

553
00:34:03,617 --> 00:34:05,743
...from, like, a mile away.

554
00:34:05,911 --> 00:34:07,662
Bet on it.

555
00:34:07,829 --> 00:34:10,623
This from the guy who still owes me
10 bucks over that bet...

556
00:34:10,791 --> 00:34:13,919
...about which was gonna be the
bigger movie, E. T. or Krush Groove.

557
00:34:14,087 --> 00:34:17,255
You know, fuck you, man,
because time's gonna tell on that one.

558
00:34:20,551 --> 00:34:24,054
Are you insinuating that I don't have
what it takes anymore?

559
00:34:24,222 --> 00:34:25,681
Insinuating, no.

560
00:34:25,848 --> 00:34:28,392
Flat-out telling you.

561
00:34:31,396 --> 00:34:33,438
Right there. Right there.
There's one.

562
00:34:33,606 --> 00:34:35,732
So? They're kissing.

563
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:36,942
Adultery.

564
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:39,277
- Adultery?
- Adultery.

565
00:34:39,445 --> 00:34:41,363
You are just a simple creature.

566
00:34:41,531 --> 00:34:43,990
- Am I right or what?
- I happen to know the truth.

567
00:34:44,158 --> 00:34:47,119
I'm not gonna tell. I wanna see
how boned up on the job you are.

568
00:34:47,286 --> 00:34:49,955
- What's your proof?
- He's wearing a wedding band.

569
00:34:50,123 --> 00:34:52,749
And it never occurred to you
that maybe she's his wife?

570
00:34:52,917 --> 00:34:55,127
No married man kisses
his wife like that.

571
00:34:55,294 --> 00:34:57,963
Okay. Well, it's a good thing
you were never...

572
00:34:58,131 --> 00:35:01,007
...the deciding member on a jury
is all I'm saying.

573
00:35:01,175 --> 00:35:04,970
"No married man kisses his wife
like that"? Are you stoned?

574
00:35:05,138 --> 00:35:06,138
Excuse me.

575
00:35:08,975 --> 00:35:10,392
Are you married?

576
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,269
Why?

577
00:35:12,437 --> 00:35:13,812
I'm just curious.

578
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,231
What do you think?

579
00:35:24,866 --> 00:35:27,200
- What?
- To her?

580
00:35:27,368 --> 00:35:29,328
- What?
- Are you married to her?

581
00:35:29,496 --> 00:35:32,832
Not that it's any of
your fucking business, but no.

582
00:35:33,333 --> 00:35:34,751
Why?

583
00:36:19,505 --> 00:36:21,547
Whose house?

584
00:36:21,715 --> 00:36:24,091
Run's house

585
00:36:24,259 --> 00:36:26,803
I said, whose house?

586
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:28,805
Run's house

587
00:36:28,972 --> 00:36:31,015
Whose house
Say what?

588
00:36:31,183 --> 00:36:33,392
Run's house
Say what?

589
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:37,021
Martin

590
00:36:39,233 --> 00:36:42,235
She's fucking pissed, dude.
She's never gonna fuck us now.

591
00:36:42,402 --> 00:36:44,320
Maybe you,
but definitely not me.

592
00:36:44,488 --> 00:36:46,573
Let me know how she is.

593
00:36:46,741 --> 00:36:49,493
Nobody is fucking me!
You got that?

594
00:36:50,411 --> 00:36:52,663
I don't know what I was thinking
in that diner...

595
00:36:52,831 --> 00:36:55,916
...but being that I've decided to
go home, and not to New Jersey...

596
00:36:56,084 --> 00:36:58,544
...sorry for the inconvenience,
and goodbye.

597
00:36:59,254 --> 00:37:00,754
You're breaking up with us?

598
00:37:02,173 --> 00:37:04,424
Who the hell do you think
you are, lady?

599
00:37:04,592 --> 00:37:07,511
You can't just go around
breaking people's hearts like that!

600
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:10,848
I fell in love with you!
We fell in love with you!

601
00:37:11,015 --> 00:37:14,101
Guys like us just don't fall out
of the fucking sky, you know.

602
00:37:21,818 --> 00:37:25,737
Beautiful, naked, big-tittied women
just don't fall out of the sky, you know.

603
00:37:39,752 --> 00:37:41,128
No heartbeat.

604
00:37:41,296 --> 00:37:44,089
Think someone threw him out a plane
with a message on him...

605
00:37:44,257 --> 00:37:45,632
...like in Con Air?

606
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,427
- Did you ever see that flick?
- Oh, did that suck!

607
00:37:48,595 --> 00:37:51,138
- Con Air? Con Shit.
- Kill it! Kill it!

608
00:37:51,306 --> 00:37:54,308
- Sounds familiar.
- Jesus, are you okay?

609
00:37:54,475 --> 00:37:56,476
Yeah, it's Rufus.
And yeah, I'm fine.

610
00:37:56,644 --> 00:37:58,812
He's the fucking undead!
Cut his head off!

611
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:01,774
Hey! What I just did gave me
a fucking migraine!

612
00:38:01,942 --> 00:38:05,945
So if you don't pipe down, I'm gonna
yank your sac off like a paper towel.

613
00:38:06,113 --> 00:38:08,489
Speaking of which,
you're awfully nude.

614
00:38:08,657 --> 00:38:11,326
- Rufus, is it?
- Yes, Rufus it is.

615
00:38:11,493 --> 00:38:15,830
It's usually Long Rufus, but it's
a little cold out here. You understand.

616
00:38:15,998 --> 00:38:19,250
Big Papa, how about lending a brother
your coat till I find threads?

617
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:23,421
Dude, he fell out of thin air.

618
00:38:24,548 --> 00:38:27,842
Dude, his piece is gonna be rubbing
inside of your armor.

619
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:30,303
- Dude!
- Thanks a lot, baby.

620
00:38:31,513 --> 00:38:33,556
I'll do my best to tuck it back.

621
00:38:33,724 --> 00:38:36,184
It's been a while since physics
but I would think...

622
00:38:36,352 --> 00:38:39,187
...the impact with which you hit
would have liquefied you.

623
00:38:39,355 --> 00:38:41,022
Death is a worry of the living.

624
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:44,651
The dead, like myself, only worry
about decay and necrophiliacs.

625
00:38:44,818 --> 00:38:47,445
- Told you he was the undead.
- Not the undead. The dead.

626
00:38:47,613 --> 00:38:48,655
I died.

627
00:38:48,822 --> 00:38:50,990
Christ told me the secret
to resurrection once.

628
00:38:51,158 --> 00:38:54,619
We were at this wedding in Canaan.
And I got drunk and forgot it.

629
00:38:54,787 --> 00:38:56,454
Wait, wait, wait.

630
00:38:56,622 --> 00:38:58,414
Christ?

631
00:38:58,582 --> 00:39:00,541
You knew Christ?

632
00:39:00,709 --> 00:39:02,710
Knew him?
Shit, nigga owes me 12 bucks.

633
00:39:03,545 --> 00:39:04,629
Let me guess.

634
00:39:04,797 --> 00:39:07,215
- You're another angel?
- Oh, I ain't no angel.

635
00:39:07,383 --> 00:39:10,134
I'm a man, just like you and him.
Well, maybe not him.

636
00:39:10,302 --> 00:39:11,844
At least I was a man.

637
00:39:12,012 --> 00:39:15,098
Been dead nearly 2000 years.
Here, check this out.

638
00:39:16,309 --> 00:39:19,395
No wonder he saw Jesus.
Homey's rocking the ganj.

639
00:39:19,562 --> 00:39:21,647
It's not a joint.

640
00:39:21,815 --> 00:39:24,024
I can't read this.

641
00:39:24,192 --> 00:39:29,154
It's Aramaic. It says,
"Rufus, see you in two years. Jesus."

642
00:39:29,322 --> 00:39:32,408
Freaked me out because he basically
told me when my number was up.

643
00:39:32,575 --> 00:39:35,327
Took all the flavor out of
the remaining years. We gotta go.

644
00:39:35,495 --> 00:39:39,039
Let's say we continue this discussion
over a two-piece and a biscuit.

645
00:39:39,207 --> 00:39:41,709
I'm starving. Back off, Kato.

646
00:39:41,876 --> 00:39:43,043
Wait a second!

647
00:39:44,587 --> 00:39:46,880
Between guys with wings,
guys falling out of the sky...

648
00:39:47,048 --> 00:39:48,924
...and guys trying like hell
to fuck me...

649
00:39:49,092 --> 00:39:52,052
...I think I've been a pretty good sport
about all this so far.

650
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:55,514
But I'm not going anywhere until
I find out where you came from.

651
00:39:55,682 --> 00:39:57,558
Me? I came from heaven.

652
00:39:57,726 --> 00:39:59,101
Now let's start walking.

653
00:39:59,269 --> 00:40:02,062
Walk? Fuck you! Do you know
how far we are from anywheres?

654
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:06,316
Hey, man, back in the old days
with J.C., we used to walk everywhere.

655
00:40:06,484 --> 00:40:08,736
Did you ever hear of
a fat apostle?

656
00:40:13,324 --> 00:40:15,617
What the hell's an apostle?

657
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:40,560
Let me get this straight.

658
00:40:40,728 --> 00:40:42,937
She's already met the prophets...

659
00:40:43,105 --> 00:40:45,106
...and the apostle's with them?

660
00:40:48,152 --> 00:40:50,320
I think that our best course
of action...

661
00:40:50,488 --> 00:40:53,907
...is to ensure that our parcel
is not found.

662
00:40:54,075 --> 00:40:58,620
And being that I can't even
trust you enough to kill a woman...

663
00:41:00,331 --> 00:41:02,832
...well, I'm left with no choice...

664
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,045
...but to seek outside assistance
in guarding said package.

665
00:41:10,466 --> 00:41:12,509
I'm gonna have to summon
the Golgothan.

666
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:18,014
I appreciate the loan.
You can have that back.

667
00:41:18,182 --> 00:41:21,476
I remember when all we had
for breakfast was fish and goat's milk.

668
00:41:21,644 --> 00:41:24,020
- What do you call this shit?
- Egga Mooby Muffin.

669
00:41:24,188 --> 00:41:27,273
Now, how about you start
explaining things, like for starters...

670
00:41:27,441 --> 00:41:28,775
...how did you find us?

671
00:41:28,943 --> 00:41:31,194
You know what the dead do
with most of their time?

672
00:41:31,362 --> 00:41:34,030
Watch the living.
Especially in the shower.

673
00:41:34,198 --> 00:41:35,698
I can't wait to die.

674
00:41:35,866 --> 00:41:37,617
And why are you watching me?

675
00:41:37,785 --> 00:41:40,036
Because you're gonna help me
get changes made...

676
00:41:40,204 --> 00:41:42,038
...in that book
you put so much stock in.

677
00:41:42,206 --> 00:41:44,499
- Hustler?
- The Bible!

678
00:41:44,667 --> 00:41:47,878
- What's your beef with the Bible?
- For starters, I'm not in it.

679
00:41:48,046 --> 00:41:50,548
Neither are we. You don't
hear us bitching and moaning.

680
00:41:50,715 --> 00:41:54,051
But I'm supposed to be in it.
I was the 13th apostle.

681
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:59,723
I've gone to church my whole life and
never heard of Rufus, the 13th apostle.

682
00:41:59,891 --> 00:42:02,560
Yeah, but you heard of
the other 12 apostles.

683
00:42:02,727 --> 00:42:06,230
Yeah, all white boys, I might add.
But no mention of me, Rufus.

684
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:08,858
And why is that?
Because I'm a black man.

685
00:42:09,025 --> 00:42:11,026
But you know what?
That's just my pet peeve.

686
00:42:11,194 --> 00:42:15,531
I'm mainly here to correct a major error
you've been basing the faith on.

687
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:19,160
- What's that?
- Jesus wasn't white. Jesus was black.

688
00:42:19,327 --> 00:42:20,411
I don't buy it.

689
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:24,665
If that's true, why did he get
written about and you were left out?

690
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:26,792
Well, he is the son of God.

691
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,253
Kind of hard to have
a New Testament without him.

692
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:32,089
So you fudge a few facts,
you put a spin on his ethnicity.

693
00:42:32,257 --> 00:42:35,759
Leaving me out's okay because you
still got 12 white boys to choose from.

694
00:42:35,927 --> 00:42:37,261
You gonna listen to this shit?

695
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:39,513
That's what the good people
of Antioch said...

696
00:42:39,681 --> 00:42:41,390
...right before they stoned my ass.

697
00:42:41,558 --> 00:42:42,600
You were martyred?

698
00:42:42,767 --> 00:42:44,602
That's one way of putting it.

699
00:42:44,769 --> 00:42:47,730
Another way is to say I was
bludgeoned by big fucking rocks.

700
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:50,608
White folks only wanna hear
the good shit:

701
00:42:50,775 --> 00:42:52,943
Life eternal,
a place in God's heaven.

702
00:42:53,111 --> 00:42:55,696
But as soon as you hear
you're getting this good shit...

703
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:57,406
...from a black Jesus, you freak.

704
00:42:57,574 --> 00:42:59,700
And that, my friends,
is called hypocrisy.

705
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:04,456
A black man can steal your stereo,
but he can't be your savior.

706
00:43:04,624 --> 00:43:05,916
Gonna eat that hash brown?

707
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:08,877
So you went to heaven?

708
00:43:09,045 --> 00:43:12,047
Damn right I went to heaven!
Shit, that's the least he could do.

709
00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:15,717
In the three years I followed his ass
around Jerusalem, did I ever get laid?

710
00:43:15,885 --> 00:43:18,762
Hell, no. And I was in my prime.

711
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:21,473
I could have been knee-deep
in shepherds' daughters...

712
00:43:21,641 --> 00:43:24,142
...not to mention fine-ass
Mary Magdalene.

713
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,144
She had a thing for dark meat.

714
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:29,272
Maybe this is just me talking,
but if I were in heaven...

715
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,442
...I wouldn't care what the Bible said
as long as the message was right.

716
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,653
The message is what counts.

717
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:38,490
But folks who build their faith
on that message should be colorblind.

718
00:43:38,658 --> 00:43:41,660
And all my rabble-rousing
is not doing that much above.

719
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:43,536
So I'm gonna need
some help down here.

720
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:47,457
That's why I'm gonna help stop those
angels from getting into that church...

721
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:50,126
...in exchange for you helping me
with my campaign.

722
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:52,963
How do you know about that,
the angels?

723
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:56,174
- Isn't much I don't know about you.
- I find that hard to believe.

724
00:43:56,342 --> 00:44:00,512
When you were 5, you let a kid
from next door piss in your hand.

725
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:04,015
You did that shit? You're nasty.

726
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:06,601
I never told anybody about that.

727
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:08,353
Neither did he.

728
00:44:08,521 --> 00:44:11,273
Two years later,
that kid died of leukemia.

729
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,025
- His name was Brian Johnson.
- Brian Johnson.

730
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:16,278
See, your exploits,
no matter how inane...

731
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:18,364
...are well documented in heaven.

732
00:44:18,532 --> 00:44:20,283
Probably hell too.

733
00:44:25,872 --> 00:44:27,164
Where are you going?

734
00:44:27,332 --> 00:44:29,041
Yo, man, tell me
something about me.

735
00:44:29,209 --> 00:44:32,086
You masturbate more
than anyone on the planet.

736
00:44:32,254 --> 00:44:35,047
Fuck. Everyone knows that.
Tell me something nobody knows.

737
00:44:35,215 --> 00:44:37,550
When you do it,
you're thinking about guys.

738
00:44:40,971 --> 00:44:43,848
- Dude, not all the time.
- Sorry if I scared you.

739
00:44:47,019 --> 00:44:50,896
Two-thirds of me wants to
forget about this and go home.

740
00:44:51,064 --> 00:44:53,566
Yesterday, I wasn't sure
if God even existed.

741
00:44:53,734 --> 00:44:57,153
Now I'm up to my ass
in Christian mythology.

742
00:44:57,321 --> 00:45:01,073
Let me let you in
on a little inside info.

743
00:45:01,241 --> 00:45:06,203
God hates it when
it's referred to as "mythology."

744
00:45:07,039 --> 00:45:11,834
Oh, well, then let's ask the "prophets"
what we should call it instead.

745
00:45:14,796 --> 00:45:17,131
Where did those two assholes go?

746
00:45:34,942 --> 00:45:36,943
What are you doing?

747
00:45:37,111 --> 00:45:39,029
Proving to this bastard
I ain't gay.

748
00:45:39,197 --> 00:45:41,114
- What?
- Long story. Forget it.

749
00:45:41,282 --> 00:45:43,533
We gotta get moving.
How can we get to Jersey?

750
00:45:43,701 --> 00:45:45,619
The train. I'll call for reservations.

751
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:45,387
I thought she looked familiar.

752
00:46:45,555 --> 00:46:47,097
- Who?
- Serendipity.

753
00:47:00,487 --> 00:47:01,529
Morning, shoppers.

754
00:47:02,114 --> 00:47:03,364
Good morning.

755
00:47:04,324 --> 00:47:06,701
- Has anyone seen the overnights?
- No, sir.

756
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:09,662
- We creamed them.
- All right.

757
00:47:12,374 --> 00:47:15,001
Last night was a rerun,
which says to me...

758
00:47:17,546 --> 00:47:19,505
Do I smell onions?

759
00:47:26,013 --> 00:47:27,263
Excuse me.

760
00:47:30,726 --> 00:47:33,186
May I ask what you're doing
in my boardroom?

761
00:47:34,146 --> 00:47:37,064
You may proceed, mon ami.

762
00:47:40,569 --> 00:47:42,653
I'm gonna have to start
by apologizing.

763
00:47:42,821 --> 00:47:45,656
My friend has a bit of a penchant
for the dramatic.

764
00:47:45,824 --> 00:47:47,408
Oh, come on!

765
00:47:49,578 --> 00:47:52,622
Would you just relax? I'm doing it.

766
00:47:54,416 --> 00:47:56,876
Mooby, the Golden Calf.

767
00:47:57,044 --> 00:48:01,339
Created by Nancy Goldruff,
a former kindergarten teacher, in 1989.

768
00:48:01,507 --> 00:48:04,175
Bought by the Complex Corporation
in 1991.

769
00:48:04,343 --> 00:48:08,013
Broadcast nationally
as the Mooby Fun-Time Hour.

770
00:48:08,181 --> 00:48:12,601
Since its inception,
has spawned two theatrical films...

771
00:48:12,769 --> 00:48:16,647
...16 records,
eight prime-time specials...

772
00:48:16,814 --> 00:48:21,318
...and a library
of priced-to-own videocassettes.

773
00:48:21,486 --> 00:48:25,364
Not to mention
bicoastal theme parks...

774
00:48:25,532 --> 00:48:27,991
...dubbed "Mooby World."

775
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:30,410
Did I miss anything?

776
00:48:30,578 --> 00:48:32,246
You forgot Mooby Magazine.

777
00:48:32,413 --> 00:48:33,747
Damn it!

778
00:48:33,915 --> 00:48:35,541
Now, is there a point to this?

779
00:48:35,708 --> 00:48:39,378
You and your board are idolaters.

780
00:48:41,464 --> 00:48:44,299
I can't believe you forgot
the magazine.

781
00:48:46,469 --> 00:48:47,970
That's you.

782
00:48:49,305 --> 00:48:51,431
Do you know much about voodoo?

783
00:48:52,976 --> 00:48:56,186
That's a fascinating practice.
No real doctrine of faith to speak of.

784
00:48:56,354 --> 00:48:58,981
More an arrangement
of superstitions...

785
00:48:59,148 --> 00:49:01,066
...the most well-known of which...

786
00:49:01,234 --> 00:49:02,651
...is the voodoo doll.

787
00:49:02,819 --> 00:49:04,278
You see...

788
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:15,581
...a mockup of an individual
is subjected...

789
00:49:15,748 --> 00:49:17,791
...to various pokes and prods.

790
00:49:17,959 --> 00:49:22,005
The desired result is that
the individual will feel those effects.

791
00:49:22,172 --> 00:49:23,631
- Call security, now!
- Yes, sir.

792
00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:31,014
All lines are currently down.

793
00:49:31,181 --> 00:49:33,474
- I have to apologize...
- Would you knock it off?

794
00:49:33,642 --> 00:49:36,019
You're doing it again. Stop.
What did we talk about?

795
00:49:37,229 --> 00:49:40,523
You are responsible
for raising an icon...

796
00:49:40,691 --> 00:49:42,567
...which draws worship
from the Lord.

797
00:49:42,735 --> 00:49:44,986
You have broken
the First Commandment.

798
00:49:45,446 --> 00:49:48,031
More than that,
I'm afraid not a one of you...

799
00:49:48,198 --> 00:49:50,867
...passes for a decent human being.

800
00:49:51,035 --> 00:49:55,371
Your continued existence
is a mockery of morality.

801
00:49:55,539 --> 00:49:57,373
Like you, Mr. Burton.

802
00:49:57,541 --> 00:50:00,960
Last year, you cheated on your wife
of 17 years eight times.

803
00:50:01,128 --> 00:50:03,212
You even had sex
with her best friend...

804
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:07,634
...while you were supposed to
be home watching the kids.

805
00:50:07,801 --> 00:50:11,220
In the bed that you
and your wife share, no less.

806
00:50:11,388 --> 00:50:12,388
Mr. Newman.

807
00:50:12,556 --> 00:50:15,224
You got your girlfriend drunk
at last year's Christmas party...

808
00:50:15,392 --> 00:50:17,560
...and then paid a kid
from the mail room...

809
00:50:17,728 --> 00:50:20,188
...to have sex with her
while she was passed out...

810
00:50:20,356 --> 00:50:22,899
...just so you could break up
with her guilt-free...

811
00:50:23,067 --> 00:50:25,318
...when she sobbingly confessed
in the morning.

812
00:50:26,862 --> 00:50:29,572
She killed herself
three months later.

813
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:32,575
Mr. Brace disowned his gay son.

814
00:50:32,743 --> 00:50:34,577
Very compassionate, Mr. Brace.

815
00:50:34,745 --> 00:50:37,748
Mr. Ray put his mother
in a third-rate nursing home...

816
00:50:37,916 --> 00:50:41,168
...and used the profits
from the sale of her home...

817
00:50:41,336 --> 00:50:45,089
...to buy an Oriental rug for himself.

818
00:50:45,256 --> 00:50:46,882
Heavens.

819
00:50:47,050 --> 00:50:49,677
Mr. Barker flew to Thailand
on the company account...

820
00:50:49,844 --> 00:50:53,430
...to have sex with
an 11-year-old boy.

821
00:50:53,598 --> 00:50:56,558
Mr. Holtzman okayed the production
of Mooby Dolls...

822
00:50:56,726 --> 00:50:59,395
...from materials he knew
to be toxic and unsafe...

823
00:50:59,562 --> 00:51:01,897
...because it was, survey says...

824
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,192
...less costly.

825
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:08,278
You, on the other hand...

826
00:51:08,446 --> 00:51:10,614
...are an innocent.

827
00:51:10,782 --> 00:51:12,574
You lead a good life.

828
00:51:12,742 --> 00:51:13,784
Good for you.

829
00:51:14,661 --> 00:51:17,663
But you, Mr. Whitland...

830
00:51:17,831 --> 00:51:21,709
...you have more skeletons in
your closet than this assembled party.

831
00:51:21,876 --> 00:51:24,545
I cannot even mention them aloud.

832
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:32,010
You're his father, you sick fuck.

833
00:51:35,098 --> 00:51:36,640
- Good.
- Not bad, right?

834
00:51:36,808 --> 00:51:38,684
That's great work. Very good.

835
00:51:40,061 --> 00:51:41,562
Well...

836
00:51:42,731 --> 00:51:44,815
...alone at last.

837
00:51:44,983 --> 00:51:47,443
With the exception of
Miss Pryce here...

838
00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:51,321
...there isn't a decent human being
amongst you.

839
00:51:51,489 --> 00:51:53,158
Not one.

840
00:51:53,325 --> 00:51:56,828
Do you know what makes
a human being decent?

841
00:51:56,996 --> 00:51:58,163
Fear.

842
00:51:58,330 --> 00:52:00,331
And therein lies the problem.

843
00:52:00,499 --> 00:52:03,334
None of you has anything
left to fear anymore.

844
00:52:03,502 --> 00:52:06,838
You rest comfortably in seats
of inscrutable power...

845
00:52:07,006 --> 00:52:10,175
...hiding behind your false idol,
far from judgment...

846
00:52:10,342 --> 00:52:13,845
...lives shrouded in secrecy,
even from one another.

847
00:52:15,306 --> 00:52:17,223
But not from God.

848
00:52:22,229 --> 00:52:24,355
Forgot my little voodoo doll.

849
00:52:26,442 --> 00:52:30,028
Man, it really looks
just like you, doesn't it?

850
00:52:30,196 --> 00:52:33,865
Look, if I believed enough in this...

851
00:52:34,033 --> 00:52:35,575
...I wonder...

852
00:52:52,384 --> 00:52:55,720
Come on. I don't believe in voodoo.

853
00:52:59,850 --> 00:53:01,726
Voodoo.

854
00:53:08,819 --> 00:53:11,320
But I do believe in this.

855
00:53:11,488 --> 00:53:13,781
Don't run! Don't run!

856
00:53:13,949 --> 00:53:17,660
Fakes! Fakes! All of you, fakes!
Oh, and you!

857
00:53:19,204 --> 00:53:21,413
"But I do believe in this."

858
00:53:21,581 --> 00:53:22,915
What does that mean?

859
00:53:23,083 --> 00:53:24,416
And one to grow on.

860
00:53:30,590 --> 00:53:31,590
Gum?

861
00:53:33,009 --> 00:53:35,553
Go on. It's okay.

862
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:37,680
You've done nothing wrong.

863
00:53:37,848 --> 00:53:40,850
These guys were fakes.

864
00:53:41,017 --> 00:53:43,269
You're a pure soul.

865
00:53:44,938 --> 00:53:47,439
But you didn't say "God bless you"
when I sneezed.

866
00:53:48,608 --> 00:53:50,401
Loki!

867
00:53:52,112 --> 00:53:53,445
You're getting off light.

868
00:53:53,613 --> 00:53:55,948
- Loki!
- I know. I'm coming.

869
00:53:59,619 --> 00:54:01,370
You're so lucky.

870
00:54:05,458 --> 00:54:08,252
I forgot you were down here.
How long now?

871
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:09,753
Three years this August.

872
00:54:09,921 --> 00:54:13,465
Let me guess, 14th apostle, left out
of the Bible because she's a woman?

873
00:54:13,633 --> 00:54:14,800
This girl's no woman.

874
00:54:14,968 --> 00:54:17,887
Oh. Those weren't tits
I saw Jay cozying up to?

875
00:54:18,054 --> 00:54:19,680
What, these?

876
00:54:19,848 --> 00:54:23,977
You should know better than anyone
here that tits don't make a woman.

877
00:54:24,145 --> 00:54:26,438
The tubby, coat-wearing
motherfucker's got tits.

878
00:54:26,606 --> 00:54:30,025
What traditionally defines a woman
falls between two things:

879
00:54:30,192 --> 00:54:31,818
Her legs.

880
00:54:31,986 --> 00:54:34,321
But as you can see...

881
00:54:34,488 --> 00:54:36,156
...I lack definition.

882
00:54:36,324 --> 00:54:39,951
Hey, they're getting a free show!
Let me see that shit!

883
00:54:40,119 --> 00:54:43,038
Oh, God,
another angel like Metatron.

884
00:54:43,205 --> 00:54:45,790
How do you know...?
How does she know Metatron?

885
00:54:45,958 --> 00:54:47,834
This is the last scion.

886
00:54:48,836 --> 00:54:50,879
You're kidding.

887
00:54:53,382 --> 00:54:54,382
I'm confused.

888
00:54:54,550 --> 00:54:58,511
Bethany, Serendipity here
isn't technically an angel.

889
00:54:58,679 --> 00:55:02,307
Nor is she, by any means,
a human being like I was and you are.

890
00:55:02,475 --> 00:55:06,144
- I used to be an abstract.
- Now I'm really confused.

891
00:55:06,312 --> 00:55:07,771
I'm a muse, stupid.

892
00:55:08,898 --> 00:55:11,441
I can't take much more of this.

893
00:55:11,609 --> 00:55:13,193
So you, what, inspire people?

894
00:55:13,361 --> 00:55:15,528
What just went down
with your friends there...

895
00:55:15,696 --> 00:55:18,990
It doesn't take a muse to inspire
horny retards to empty their wallets.

896
00:55:19,158 --> 00:55:21,034
I used to specialize
in entertainment.

897
00:55:21,202 --> 00:55:26,623
For example, I'm responsible for 19 of
the 20 top-grossing films of all time.

898
00:55:26,791 --> 00:55:29,292
- Nineteen?
- Yeah.

899
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:32,295
The one about the kid
by himself in his house...

900
00:55:32,463 --> 00:55:35,382
...burglars trying to come in
and he fights them off...

901
00:55:35,549 --> 00:55:37,717
...I had nothing to do
with that one.

902
00:55:38,219 --> 00:55:42,139
Somebody sold their soul to Satan to
get grosses up on that piece of shit.

903
00:56:00,575 --> 00:56:02,868
What are you doing stripping?

904
00:56:03,036 --> 00:56:04,370
You remember why I left?

905
00:56:04,538 --> 00:56:07,873
Because you were tired of getting
none of the credit for your ideas.

906
00:56:08,041 --> 00:56:11,085
So I opted to quit being a muse
and write for myself.

907
00:56:11,253 --> 00:56:15,089
I gave my two weeks' notice,
got a body, 50 bucks...

908
00:56:15,257 --> 00:56:18,217
...and got sent out into the world
to make my fortune.

909
00:56:18,385 --> 00:56:19,927
So, what happened?

910
00:56:21,138 --> 00:56:22,680
Writer's block.

911
00:56:22,848 --> 00:56:25,599
Can you believe it?
Me, a muse, for God's sake.

912
00:56:25,767 --> 00:56:29,729
I can inspire anyone I meet and give
out a zillion and nine ideas a second...

913
00:56:29,896 --> 00:56:31,731
...but I can't keep any for myself.

914
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,735
Her quirky sense of humor.

915
00:56:35,902 --> 00:56:38,029
- Whose?
- God's.

916
00:56:38,196 --> 00:56:41,073
- You're saying God's a woman?
- Was there a doubt in your mind?

917
00:56:41,241 --> 00:56:42,950
He's always referred to as "him."

918
00:56:43,118 --> 00:56:44,660
Well, that's not how I wrote it.

919
00:56:44,828 --> 00:56:46,954
But one of the drawbacks
to being intangible...

920
00:56:47,122 --> 00:56:49,623
...is that you have no say
in the editorial process.

921
00:56:49,791 --> 00:56:52,793
The people that held the pens
added their own perspective...

922
00:56:52,961 --> 00:56:55,380
...and all the penholders were men.

923
00:56:55,548 --> 00:56:59,384
So she became a he.
Doesn't stop with God either.

924
00:56:59,552 --> 00:57:01,511
The whole book's gender-biased.

925
00:57:01,679 --> 00:57:03,805
A woman's responsible
for original sin.

926
00:57:03,973 --> 00:57:06,099
A woman cuts Samson's
coif of power.

927
00:57:06,267 --> 00:57:09,561
A woman asks for the head
of John the Baptist.

928
00:57:09,729 --> 00:57:11,104
Read that book again.

929
00:57:11,272 --> 00:57:14,316
Women are bigger antagonists than
Egyptians and Romans combined.

930
00:57:14,484 --> 00:57:15,650
It stinks.

931
00:57:22,116 --> 00:57:23,784
Why is the last scion here?

932
00:57:23,951 --> 00:57:26,828
Bartleby and Loki.
They found a way back.

933
00:57:26,996 --> 00:57:30,082
- Not the plenary-indulgence loophole.
- You know about that?

934
00:57:30,249 --> 00:57:32,751
I always knew that thing
was a bad idea.

935
00:57:32,919 --> 00:57:35,087
Leave it to the Catholics
to destroy existence.

936
00:57:35,254 --> 00:57:37,672
You have issues with Catholicism,
I take it?

937
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:41,343
I have issues with those who treat God
like a burden instead of a blessing...

938
00:57:41,511 --> 00:57:42,761
...like some Catholics.

939
00:57:42,929 --> 00:57:45,806
You people don't celebrate your faith,
you mourn it.

940
00:57:45,973 --> 00:57:50,102
- lf we're wrong, what religion is right?
- It's not about who's right or wrong.

941
00:57:50,269 --> 00:57:52,104
No denomination's nailed it yet...

942
00:57:52,271 --> 00:57:54,815
...because they're all
too self-righteous to realize...

943
00:57:54,982 --> 00:57:59,820
...that it doesn't matter what you have
faith in, Just that you have faith.

944
00:57:59,987 --> 00:58:04,324
Your hearts are in the right place,
but your brains gotta wake up.

945
00:58:06,786 --> 00:58:09,287
Look, they made me and Silent Bob
part of the gang.

946
00:58:15,254 --> 00:58:17,213
Who fucking farted?

947
00:58:18,715 --> 00:58:21,884
Not born. Shit into existence.

948
00:58:25,389 --> 00:58:28,141
Sweet Christ,
somebody wants you bad!

949
00:58:28,308 --> 00:58:30,726
- What is that thing?
- An excremental.

950
00:58:30,894 --> 00:58:33,062
- The Golgothan.
- A what?

951
00:58:33,230 --> 00:58:34,522
A shit demon!

952
00:58:34,690 --> 00:58:38,234
No man of woman born!

953
00:58:39,403 --> 00:58:42,196
- Friend of yours?
- Is this smelly fuck with us?

954
00:58:42,364 --> 00:58:43,906
It came for Bethany!

955
00:58:44,074 --> 00:58:46,909
Smoke that motherfucker
like it ain't no thing!

956
00:58:47,077 --> 00:58:49,412
Damn! I knew I was gonna
whack somebody today!

957
00:58:49,580 --> 00:58:51,414
Yo, get your fucking hand back.

958
00:58:51,582 --> 00:58:52,748
Represent!

959
00:58:54,209 --> 00:58:56,586
Go! Go! Go!

960
00:59:17,941 --> 00:59:20,276
Looks like we're in charge
of the gang now.

961
00:59:21,778 --> 00:59:23,196
Over the bar! Come on!

962
00:59:32,790 --> 00:59:36,126
- Where did that thing come from?
- Ever heard of Golgotha?

963
00:59:36,294 --> 00:59:38,170
The hill where Christ
was crucified?

964
00:59:38,338 --> 00:59:41,048
It wasn't just Christ.
The Romans crucified everyone there.

965
00:59:41,216 --> 00:59:44,635
Christ excluded, they were criminals.
Killers, brigands, thieves, rapists.

966
00:59:44,802 --> 00:59:47,888
Whenever the crucified expired,
their bodies lost muscle control...

967
00:59:48,056 --> 00:59:50,474
...spilling bowel and bladder
in the process...

968
00:59:50,642 --> 00:59:53,393
...the result of which is
that walking pile of crap there.

969
00:59:53,561 --> 00:59:56,563
The Golgothan shit demon,
hell's chief assassin.

970
00:59:56,731 --> 00:59:58,440
And it's here for you, girlie.

971
01:00:03,529 --> 01:00:06,114
- Bob, get down!
- Matches! Matches!

972
01:00:38,189 --> 01:00:40,691
- You the man.
- How?

973
01:00:42,528 --> 01:00:44,153
"Knocks strong odors out."

974
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:47,782
- Way to go, biggie.
- Why would you ever carry this?

975
01:00:49,827 --> 01:00:50,952
What?

976
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:52,954
Whoever sent this might send more.

977
01:00:53,122 --> 01:00:57,000
I suggest you take the princess
and get as far away as possible.

978
01:00:57,167 --> 01:00:59,627
I'll try to get something
out of poopy boy here.

979
01:00:59,795 --> 01:01:02,547
If he tells me something,
I'll let you know.

980
01:01:03,716 --> 01:01:06,050
Hello. We'd like two tickets
to New Jersey, please.

981
01:01:06,218 --> 01:01:08,845
- Jersey's sold out, sir.
- What?

982
01:01:09,013 --> 01:01:10,513
There's one same time tomorrow.

983
01:01:10,681 --> 01:01:14,517
Don't underestimate the staggering
drawing power of the Garden State...

984
01:01:14,685 --> 01:01:16,894
...and show up
two hours in advance.

985
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:20,606
Nice.

986
01:01:20,774 --> 01:01:23,609
Your hard-on for smiting
has prevented us from negotiating...

987
01:01:23,777 --> 01:01:27,822
...what ought to be the relatively simple
matter of catching or staying on a bus.

988
01:01:27,990 --> 01:01:29,574
Bus, schmus.

989
01:01:29,742 --> 01:01:34,245
Why should we fall victim to gravity
when we can just as easily rise above?

990
01:01:34,413 --> 01:01:36,748
- You mean fly?
- We got wings, right?

991
01:01:36,915 --> 01:01:38,416
Fuck, let's use them!

992
01:01:38,584 --> 01:01:40,960
I wouldn't suggest that.

993
01:01:42,379 --> 01:01:44,130
You see, kids...

994
01:01:44,298 --> 01:01:47,925
...you wouldn't want to look like
a couple of fairies, now, would you?

995
01:01:53,349 --> 01:01:55,391
Look at this pimp.
How'd you get out of hell?

996
01:01:55,559 --> 01:01:57,686
I said I was coming up
on a routine possession.

997
01:01:57,854 --> 01:02:01,065
I don't have much time. They figure
out my ruse, they'll come for me.

998
01:02:01,232 --> 01:02:04,818
- What's with bringing us in here?
- You're inches from getting caught.

999
01:02:04,986 --> 01:02:08,405
Going around killing people,
about to uncase your wings.

1000
01:02:08,573 --> 01:02:10,407
Don't you know what's going on?

1001
01:02:10,575 --> 01:02:12,409
Well, we're going home.

1002
01:02:12,577 --> 01:02:16,955
Really. Are you so clueless as to think
you can just waltz back into heaven?

1003
01:02:17,123 --> 01:02:19,583
- Why not?
- Everybody is looking for you.

1004
01:02:19,751 --> 01:02:22,586
Both sides. Above and below.

1005
01:02:22,754 --> 01:02:24,963
Orders are to terminate you
on sight.

1006
01:02:25,131 --> 01:02:26,423
- Really?
- Why?

1007
01:02:26,591 --> 01:02:28,675
Because you're pissing people off,
that's why.

1008
01:02:30,095 --> 01:02:32,638
Word is that God's pissed off
at your presumption...

1009
01:02:32,806 --> 01:02:35,974
...and I know Lucifer's pissed because
you might make him look bad...

1010
01:02:36,142 --> 01:02:37,976
...by succeeding where he's failed.

1011
01:02:38,144 --> 01:02:41,146
- So they're just gonna kill us?
- They're gonna try.

1012
01:02:41,314 --> 01:02:44,149
That's why you have to
travel incognito.

1013
01:02:44,317 --> 01:02:47,277
Tone down your behavior.
Stay off their respective radars.

1014
01:02:47,445 --> 01:02:49,321
Quit killing people.
That's high-profile.

1015
01:02:49,489 --> 01:02:52,282
- Oh, lighten up.
- I can't believe they wanna kill us.

1016
01:02:52,450 --> 01:02:54,326
Oh, believe it, boys.

1017
01:02:55,578 --> 01:02:57,788
They've even got the last scion
looking for you.

1018
01:02:57,956 --> 01:02:59,623
- Really?
- You're kidding.

1019
01:02:59,791 --> 01:03:02,668
This is huge. Your reentry
is a thorn in a lot of sides.

1020
01:03:02,836 --> 01:03:04,670
They'll stop at nothing
to prevent it.

1021
01:03:04,921 --> 01:03:08,006
Meanwhile, I suggest you find
an alternate mode of transportation.

1022
01:03:08,174 --> 01:03:10,175
If anything else comes up,
I'll contact you.

1023
01:03:10,343 --> 01:03:13,430
Thank you, Azrael.
You're a true friend.

1024
01:03:13,597 --> 01:03:16,433
I have to get back to the pit
before they get suspicious.

1025
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:20,186
And remember, incognito.

1026
01:03:25,151 --> 01:03:27,193
How you coping, kid?

1027
01:03:27,361 --> 01:03:28,987
It's weird.

1028
01:03:29,155 --> 01:03:31,656
Just when I think
I have a handle on things...

1029
01:03:31,824 --> 01:03:34,993
...something wholly unbelievable
presents itself.

1030
01:03:35,161 --> 01:03:37,620
Sometimes I wish
I'd just stayed home.

1031
01:03:37,788 --> 01:03:40,373
You sound like the man.

1032
01:03:40,541 --> 01:03:41,833
What's he like?

1033
01:03:42,001 --> 01:03:44,461
He likes to listen to people talk.

1034
01:03:44,628 --> 01:03:47,964
Christ loved to sit around the fire,
listen to me and the other guys.

1035
01:03:48,132 --> 01:03:50,550
Whenever we were going on
about unimportant shit...

1036
01:03:50,718 --> 01:03:52,677
...he always had a smile
on his face.

1037
01:03:52,845 --> 01:03:54,804
His oly real beef with mankind...

1038
01:03:54,972 --> 01:03:58,141
...is the shit that gets carried out
in his name.

1039
01:03:58,309 --> 01:04:01,603
Wars, bigotry, televangelism.

1040
01:04:01,770 --> 01:04:05,356
The big one, though,
is the factioning of all the religions.

1041
01:04:05,524 --> 01:04:07,358
He said mankind got it all wrong...

1042
01:04:07,526 --> 01:04:10,904
...by taking a good idea
and building a belief structure on it.

1043
01:04:11,071 --> 01:04:13,656
You're saying having beliefs
is a bad thing?

1044
01:04:13,824 --> 01:04:15,825
I just think it's better
to have ideas.

1045
01:04:15,993 --> 01:04:19,037
You can change an idea.
Changing a belief is trickier.

1046
01:04:19,205 --> 01:04:21,581
People die for it. People kill for it.

1047
01:04:21,749 --> 01:04:24,083
The whole of existence
is in jeopardy right now...

1048
01:04:24,251 --> 01:04:29,298
...because of the Catholic beliefs
regarding this plenary-indulgence shit.

1049
01:04:29,466 --> 01:04:31,759
Bartleby and Loki,
whether they know it or not...

1050
01:04:31,927 --> 01:04:33,677
...are exploiting that belief...

1051
01:04:33,845 --> 01:04:35,387
...and if they're successful...

1052
01:04:35,555 --> 01:04:39,475
...you, me, all of this
ends in a heartbeat.

1053
01:04:39,643 --> 01:04:41,560
All over a belief.

1054
01:04:43,855 --> 01:04:47,775
I haven't seen the moron twins
in a while. How about you?

1055
01:04:47,943 --> 01:04:50,903
One time we were at the mall,
we tied Tubby to the ceiling...

1056
01:04:51,071 --> 01:04:54,406
...and he went flying through the air,
fucking crashed through the wall.

1057
01:04:54,574 --> 01:04:55,824
It was fucked up.

1058
01:04:55,992 --> 01:04:58,327
You two aren't getting into
any trouble, are you?

1059
01:04:58,495 --> 01:05:02,164
No. We're just about to smoke a fatty
with these two suave motherfuckers...

1060
01:05:02,332 --> 01:05:05,543
...who just got on at the last stop.
This is Larry and Barry.

1061
01:05:05,710 --> 01:05:06,961
- Hi.
- Hey.

1062
01:05:07,128 --> 01:05:09,630
So Jay tells us
you're gonna sleep with him.

1063
01:05:14,844 --> 01:05:17,179
Hit this shit, man. It's good stuff.

1064
01:05:18,223 --> 01:05:19,890
Oh, fuck.

1065
01:05:23,228 --> 01:05:25,604
That's some bad shit, dude.

1066
01:05:25,772 --> 01:05:27,648
You hit that?

1067
01:05:30,068 --> 01:05:31,986
Yeah, you're bad, dude.

1068
01:05:35,198 --> 01:05:36,615
Bad shit.

1069
01:05:37,659 --> 01:05:40,119
So why are you
heading to New Jersey?

1070
01:05:40,287 --> 01:05:43,623
It's just this thing I have to do.

1071
01:05:43,791 --> 01:05:45,166
We're going home.

1072
01:05:45,334 --> 01:05:48,003
Oh. Do you two live together?

1073
01:05:48,170 --> 01:05:49,963
Unfortunately, yes.

1074
01:05:52,675 --> 01:05:55,343
So how long have you two
been together?

1075
01:05:56,679 --> 01:05:58,471
A while.

1076
01:05:58,639 --> 01:06:02,267
He can be pretty flaky sometimes,
but we have a lot in common.

1077
01:06:02,685 --> 01:06:03,935
How'd you meet?

1078
01:06:04,103 --> 01:06:05,604
We were stationed together.

1079
01:06:05,771 --> 01:06:08,023
See, that's beautiful.

1080
01:06:08,190 --> 01:06:11,985
Everybody's always up in arms
about this "out in the military" issue.

1081
01:06:13,154 --> 01:06:14,195
Pardon?

1082
01:06:14,363 --> 01:06:18,533
There's all that macho bullshit
about it being "this man's army."

1083
01:06:18,701 --> 01:06:20,869
And you two meet there, hook up...

1084
01:06:21,912 --> 01:06:25,040
You think we're lovers?
No, no. We're not gay.

1085
01:06:25,207 --> 01:06:27,542
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

1086
01:06:27,710 --> 01:06:30,712
- I just assumed.
- Do I come off as gay?

1087
01:06:31,255 --> 01:06:33,465
- No.
- All right.

1088
01:06:33,633 --> 01:06:36,718
My ex-husband sort of screwed up
my relationship awareness barometer.

1089
01:06:36,886 --> 01:06:39,387
- You're divorced.
- That's a nice way of putting it.

1090
01:06:39,555 --> 01:06:41,056
I call it being dumped.

1091
01:06:41,223 --> 01:06:43,099
I was...

1092
01:06:43,267 --> 01:06:44,851
...dumped once.

1093
01:06:45,019 --> 01:06:47,854
Don't you just constantly
question your value?

1094
01:06:48,022 --> 01:06:50,565
Like, why was I so easy
to cast aside?

1095
01:06:50,733 --> 01:06:54,235
And you wonder if the other party
is gonna come to their senses...

1096
01:06:54,403 --> 01:06:55,737
...and call you back.

1097
01:06:55,905 --> 01:06:59,241
And they always tell you
it'll hurt less with time.

1098
01:06:59,409 --> 01:07:01,410
When actually...

1099
01:07:01,578 --> 01:07:03,204
...it hurts more.

1100
01:07:07,167 --> 01:07:08,834
You know what we need?

1101
01:07:09,002 --> 01:07:10,753
What do we need?

1102
01:07:10,921 --> 01:07:12,338
We need drinks.

1103
01:07:14,508 --> 01:07:15,883
We need a lot of drinks.

1104
01:07:17,552 --> 01:07:19,428
Garçon.

1105
01:07:26,144 --> 01:07:27,853
You're saying you still
go to church?

1106
01:07:28,021 --> 01:07:30,106
Every Sunday.

1107
01:07:30,273 --> 01:07:32,566
Does it...? I mean, does it
do anything for you?

1108
01:07:32,734 --> 01:07:35,778
It gives me time to balance
my checkbook every week.

1109
01:07:35,946 --> 01:07:39,949
That's what I'm saying. People don't
go to church to feel spiritual anymore.

1110
01:07:40,117 --> 01:07:42,284
They go to church and feel bored...

1111
01:07:42,452 --> 01:07:45,746
...but they keep going every week
just out of habit.

1112
01:07:45,914 --> 01:07:48,124
I am so buzzed.

1113
01:07:49,793 --> 01:07:52,628
When do you think
you lost your faith?

1114
01:07:52,796 --> 01:07:55,005
I remember the exact moment.

1115
01:07:57,634 --> 01:08:01,303
I was on the phone
with my mother...

1116
01:08:01,471 --> 01:08:05,433
...and she was trying to counsel me
through this...

1117
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:08,310
This thing.

1118
01:08:10,105 --> 01:08:14,484
And when nothing she was saying
was making me feel any better...

1119
01:08:14,652 --> 01:08:16,486
...she said:

1120
01:08:16,654 --> 01:08:18,447
"Bethany...

1121
01:08:18,614 --> 01:08:20,824
...God has a plan."

1122
01:08:23,911 --> 01:08:27,622
I was... I was so angry with her.

1123
01:08:29,709 --> 01:08:31,251
I was like:

1124
01:08:31,419 --> 01:08:33,253
"What about my plans?"

1125
01:08:33,421 --> 01:08:35,172
You know?

1126
01:08:35,339 --> 01:08:38,300
I had planned to have a family...

1127
01:08:38,468 --> 01:08:40,010
...with my husband.

1128
01:08:40,178 --> 01:08:43,096
Wasn't that plan
good enough for God?

1129
01:08:47,018 --> 01:08:48,852
Apparently not.

1130
01:08:52,231 --> 01:08:56,234
How about you?
When did you lose your faith?

1131
01:08:57,403 --> 01:08:59,571
A long time ago.

1132
01:08:59,739 --> 01:09:03,158
One day God just stopped listening.

1133
01:09:03,326 --> 01:09:04,618
I kept talking...

1134
01:09:04,786 --> 01:09:07,788
...but I got the distinct impression
he wasn't listening anymore.

1135
01:09:07,955 --> 01:09:11,208
How did you know she was listening
in the first place?

1136
01:09:14,504 --> 01:09:16,129
Well, I guess I don't.

1137
01:09:16,297 --> 01:09:19,216
I hate thoughts like that.

1138
01:09:19,634 --> 01:09:22,636
But, you know,
they come to you with age.

1139
01:09:22,804 --> 01:09:27,808
Because when you're a kid you never
question the whole faith thing.

1140
01:09:28,684 --> 01:09:31,395
God's in heaven, and he's...

1141
01:09:31,563 --> 01:09:34,941
She's always got her eye on you.

1142
01:09:39,446 --> 01:09:42,323
I'd give anything
to feel that way again.

1143
01:09:47,496 --> 01:09:50,665
Guess that's why
I got talked into this pilgrimage.

1144
01:09:58,924 --> 01:10:01,092
Where is this pilgrimage to?

1145
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:04,345
- You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
- Try me.

1146
01:10:04,513 --> 01:10:06,764
All right, but I warned you.

1147
01:10:06,932 --> 01:10:08,516
Okay.

1148
01:10:08,684 --> 01:10:12,186
I'm going to this church
in New Jersey.

1149
01:10:12,729 --> 01:10:14,063
Really?

1150
01:10:14,231 --> 01:10:18,568
Kerwood Mandel to car three.
Kerwood Mandel to car three.

1151
01:10:18,735 --> 01:10:22,113
See, I'm supposed to stop
a couple of angels...

1152
01:10:22,281 --> 01:10:24,115
...from going into the church.

1153
01:10:26,076 --> 01:10:27,869
They're trying...

1154
01:10:28,036 --> 01:10:29,453
Shit.

1155
01:10:31,248 --> 01:10:34,000
They're trying
to get back into heaven.

1156
01:10:37,045 --> 01:10:39,589
See, they got tossed
out of heaven...

1157
01:10:39,756 --> 01:10:41,716
...years ago, right?

1158
01:10:42,259 --> 01:10:44,385
And if they get back in...

1159
01:10:44,553 --> 01:10:46,305
...it proves God wrong...

1160
01:10:46,472 --> 01:10:49,558
...and since God is infallible...

1161
01:10:49,726 --> 01:10:51,393
...to prove her wrong...

1162
01:10:51,561 --> 01:10:55,230
...would, you know,
unmake existence.

1163
01:10:56,608 --> 01:10:58,650
May I have your attention, please.

1164
01:10:58,818 --> 01:11:02,988
The dining car will be closing
in five minutes. Thank you.

1165
01:11:03,156 --> 01:11:05,657
I feel so stupid...

1166
01:11:05,825 --> 01:11:07,743
...just saying it.

1167
01:11:09,203 --> 01:11:11,496
The thing I don't get is, I mean...

1168
01:11:11,664 --> 01:11:14,249
...how am I supposed to stop
an angel?

1169
01:11:14,417 --> 01:11:15,834
Two, even!

1170
01:11:21,007 --> 01:11:24,259
I guess I'm supposed to
talk them out of it or something.

1171
01:11:24,427 --> 01:11:26,470
Maybe you're supposed to
kill them.

1172
01:11:26,638 --> 01:11:30,265
Oh, yeah, right. Kill them.

1173
01:11:31,142 --> 01:11:35,354
I mean, even if that were the case,
which it's not...

1174
01:11:36,856 --> 01:11:39,858
...how do you kill an angel, Barry?

1175
01:11:43,196 --> 01:11:47,115
I don't suppose it's much different
from killing a human.

1176
01:11:48,618 --> 01:11:51,161
Where the hell is everybody?
I wake up and...

1177
01:11:53,206 --> 01:11:55,040
- The apostle.
- Holy shit!

1178
01:11:55,208 --> 01:11:58,126
Rufus, I want you to meet
my new friend Barry.

1179
01:12:01,548 --> 01:12:03,466
Don't be such a show-off, Barry.

1180
01:12:03,634 --> 01:12:06,302
Take it easy, Bartleby.
Just let her go.

1181
01:12:06,470 --> 01:12:08,638
- We can talk about this.
- Bartleby?

1182
01:12:08,806 --> 01:12:12,308
After all this time, it comes down
to slaughter by a meat puppet?

1183
01:12:12,476 --> 01:12:15,228
Get your fucking hands off me,
you dickless son of a bitch!

1184
01:12:15,396 --> 01:12:18,231
Save it, lady. Five minutes ago
you were aching to top me off.

1185
01:12:18,399 --> 01:12:19,816
Loki!

1186
01:12:20,401 --> 01:12:21,567
Holy shit. The apostle.

1187
01:12:21,735 --> 01:12:23,736
I didn't come in you, Pete,
I swear.

1188
01:12:23,904 --> 01:12:25,029
What are you doing here?

1189
01:12:25,197 --> 01:12:27,824
This woman has to stop two angels
from entering a church.

1190
01:12:27,992 --> 01:12:30,076
- She means us?
- No, two other fucking angels.

1191
01:12:30,244 --> 01:12:33,579
I'd say there's a pretty good chance.
Rufus, we're to be liquidated?

1192
01:12:33,747 --> 01:12:36,416
You haven't thought about
the consequences of your reentry.

1193
01:12:36,583 --> 01:12:38,209
Consequences, schmonsequences.

1194
01:12:38,377 --> 01:12:41,212
We're going home, okay?
No matter whose pride it may hurt.

1195
01:12:41,380 --> 01:12:43,756
- It's not a matter of pride!
- Loki, kill the girl.

1196
01:12:43,924 --> 01:12:46,592
Are you high? I can't kill her
if she hasn't done anything.

1197
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:48,052
Fine. I'll kill her myself.

1198
01:12:48,220 --> 01:12:50,430
What, I fall asleep
and everyone takes off?

1199
01:12:50,597 --> 01:12:53,099
- These guys are fucking flat-leavers.
- Shut his mouth.

1200
01:13:03,193 --> 01:13:04,777
Oh, shit!

1201
01:13:06,405 --> 01:13:07,613
Jay!

1202
01:13:08,907 --> 01:13:10,033
Biggie!

1203
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:12,577
The door! The door!

1204
01:13:16,457 --> 01:13:18,625
Can't we talk about this?

1205
01:13:24,215 --> 01:13:27,134
Why don't I just get off
at the next stop!

1206
01:14:07,175 --> 01:14:09,176
No ticket.

1207
01:14:11,888 --> 01:14:14,515
- The apostle is here.
- I noticed.

1208
01:14:14,682 --> 01:14:16,767
Then you know who the chick was,
don't you?

1209
01:14:16,935 --> 01:14:18,143
The scion, I imagine!

1210
01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:21,021
Maybe we should rethink
this whole thing.

1211
01:14:21,189 --> 01:14:24,274
I mean, you heard the guy.
He said there are consequences.

1212
01:14:24,442 --> 01:14:26,360
And Azrael tells us we're marked?

1213
01:14:26,528 --> 01:14:28,320
There's more to this
than we thought of.

1214
01:14:28,488 --> 01:14:30,405
I was close.

1215
01:14:30,573 --> 01:14:33,660
You know? I was so close
to slitting that bitch's throat.

1216
01:14:34,995 --> 01:14:38,164
You know how I felt? Righteous.

1217
01:14:38,332 --> 01:14:39,833
Justified. Eager, even.

1218
01:14:40,209 --> 01:14:41,960
You all right?
Your eyes are kind of...

1219
01:14:42,128 --> 01:14:44,170
My eyes are open.

1220
01:14:44,338 --> 01:14:46,172
For the first time I get it.

1221
01:14:46,340 --> 01:14:50,051
When that little innocent girl
let her mission slip, I had an epiphany.

1222
01:14:50,219 --> 01:14:53,888
See, in the beginning it was
just us and him, angels and God.

1223
01:14:54,056 --> 01:14:55,723
Then he created humans.

1224
01:14:55,891 --> 01:14:58,810
Ours was designed to be
a life of servitude and worship...

1225
01:14:58,978 --> 01:15:02,147
...and bowing and scraping
and adoration.

1226
01:15:02,314 --> 01:15:04,607
He gave them more
than he ever gave us.

1227
01:15:04,775 --> 01:15:06,651
He gave them a choice.

1228
01:15:06,819 --> 01:15:10,029
They choose to acknowledge God
or choose to ignore him.

1229
01:15:10,197 --> 01:15:12,031
All this time
we've been down here...

1230
01:15:12,199 --> 01:15:14,701
...l've felt the absence
of the divine presence...

1231
01:15:14,869 --> 01:15:18,079
...and it's pained me,
as I'm sure it must have pained you.

1232
01:15:18,247 --> 01:15:21,875
And why?
Because of the way he made us.

1233
01:15:22,042 --> 01:15:25,587
Had we been given free will, we could
choose to ignore the pain like they do.

1234
01:15:25,754 --> 01:15:27,380
But no, we're servants.

1235
01:15:27,548 --> 01:15:29,465
Okay.

1236
01:15:29,633 --> 01:15:33,052
You know, all I'm saying here is that
one of us might need a little nap.

1237
01:15:33,220 --> 01:15:34,220
Wake up!

1238
01:15:34,388 --> 01:15:37,056
Humans have besmirched
everything he's bestowed on them.

1239
01:15:37,224 --> 01:15:39,058
They were given paradise,
they threw it away.

1240
01:15:39,226 --> 01:15:41,561
They were given this planet,
they destroyed it.

1241
01:15:41,729 --> 01:15:44,189
They were favored best
among all his endeavors...

1242
01:15:44,356 --> 01:15:47,609
...and some of them
don't even believe he exists!

1243
01:15:47,776 --> 01:15:49,778
And in spite of it all...

1244
01:15:49,946 --> 01:15:53,574
...he has shown them
infinite fucking patience...

1245
01:15:53,742 --> 01:15:55,451
...at every turn.

1246
01:15:55,619 --> 01:15:57,119
What about us?

1247
01:15:58,288 --> 01:16:01,123
I asked you once...

1248
01:16:01,291 --> 01:16:04,126
...to lay down the sword
because I felt sorry for them.

1249
01:16:04,669 --> 01:16:06,045
What was the result?

1250
01:16:06,213 --> 01:16:08,380
Our expulsion from paradise.

1251
01:16:08,548 --> 01:16:11,050
Where was his
infinite fucking patience then?

1252
01:16:11,218 --> 01:16:13,969
It's not right! It's not fair!

1253
01:16:14,137 --> 01:16:16,013
We've paid our debt!

1254
01:16:17,474 --> 01:16:20,184
Don't you think it's time?

1255
01:16:20,352 --> 01:16:23,187
Don't you think it's time
we went home?

1256
01:16:24,898 --> 01:16:29,818
And to do that, I think we may have to
dispatch our would-be dispatchers.

1257
01:16:29,986 --> 01:16:32,571
Wait. Wait, wait. Kill them?

1258
01:16:33,782 --> 01:16:36,408
You're talking about the last scion,
for chrissake.

1259
01:16:36,576 --> 01:16:39,411
And what about Jay and Bob?
Those guys were all right.

1260
01:16:39,579 --> 01:16:41,038
Don't. Don't, my friend.

1261
01:16:41,206 --> 01:16:44,750
See, don't let your sympathies
get the best of you.

1262
01:16:44,918 --> 01:16:46,335
They did me once.

1263
01:16:46,503 --> 01:16:48,295
Scion or not...

1264
01:16:48,463 --> 01:16:49,797
...she's just a human...

1265
01:16:49,965 --> 01:16:53,008
...and by passing through that arch
our sins are forgiven.

1266
01:16:53,176 --> 01:16:55,177
No harm, no foul.

1267
01:16:56,346 --> 01:16:59,181
My God.
I've heard a rant like this before.

1268
01:17:00,809 --> 01:17:02,101
What did you say?

1269
01:17:02,269 --> 01:17:05,272
- I've heard a rant like this before.
- Don't you do that to me.

1270
01:17:05,439 --> 01:17:08,358
- You sound like the morning star.
- You shut your fucking mouth!

1271
01:17:08,526 --> 01:17:11,528
You sound like Lucifer, man!
You've fucking lost it!

1272
01:17:11,696 --> 01:17:14,197
You're not talking about
going home, Bartleby.

1273
01:17:14,365 --> 01:17:16,866
You're talking about
fucking war on God.

1274
01:17:18,327 --> 01:17:19,869
Well, fuck that.

1275
01:17:20,037 --> 01:17:24,291
I have seen what happens to the proud
when they take on the throne.

1276
01:17:25,835 --> 01:17:27,377
I'm going back to Wisconsin.

1277
01:17:28,879 --> 01:17:30,672
We're going home, Loki...

1278
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:34,801
...and no one, not you,
not even the Almighty himself...

1279
01:17:34,969 --> 01:17:36,803
...is gonna make that otherwise.

1280
01:17:43,394 --> 01:17:44,811
Shit.

1281
01:17:46,022 --> 01:17:49,566
Why couldn't we stay on the train?
You threw those guys off.

1282
01:17:49,734 --> 01:17:51,401
Very basic strategy.

1283
01:17:51,569 --> 01:17:54,904
If your enemies know where you are,
then don't be there.

1284
01:17:55,072 --> 01:17:56,072
Why are we enemies?

1285
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:59,534
Well, I know I'd perceive the person
sent to kill me as an enemy.

1286
01:17:59,702 --> 01:18:02,996
What does that mean? Since when
am I supposed to kill anybody?

1287
01:18:03,164 --> 01:18:06,750
I'm tired of
all this cryptic bullshit.

1288
01:18:06,917 --> 01:18:09,419
I'm physically and psychologically
exhausted, Rufus...

1289
01:18:09,587 --> 01:18:12,714
...and I'm ready to kick back
and welcome the end of existence...

1290
01:18:12,882 --> 01:18:15,175
...unless you come clean right now.

1291
01:18:15,343 --> 01:18:17,344
Why me?

1292
01:18:17,511 --> 01:18:20,931
Out of all the people on the
goddamn planet, why was I tapped?

1293
01:18:21,099 --> 01:18:24,310
Imagine you're a 12-year-old boy.

1294
01:18:25,228 --> 01:18:29,190
You're told you're God's only son,
but more than that, you're God.

1295
01:18:29,358 --> 01:18:32,860
How long would it take to come
to grips with something that huge?

1296
01:18:33,028 --> 01:18:35,613
Maybe, say, 18 years?

1297
01:18:35,781 --> 01:18:40,785
In the Bible, Jesus suddenly goes
from age 12 to 30. Twelve to 30.

1298
01:18:40,952 --> 01:18:43,079
Now, that's some pretty bad
storytelling.

1299
01:18:43,246 --> 01:18:46,082
Where are the volumes of text
dealing with the missing 18 years?

1300
01:18:46,249 --> 01:18:47,458
I'll tell you where.

1301
01:18:47,626 --> 01:18:52,296
They were offered up as a sacrifice
to the god of ecumenical politics.

1302
01:18:52,464 --> 01:18:55,383
You make it sound like
there's some church conspiracy...

1303
01:18:55,550 --> 01:18:58,219
...to cover up
"the truth about Christ."

1304
01:19:00,639 --> 01:19:01,972
Oh, bullshit.

1305
01:19:02,140 --> 01:19:04,058
Any important material
about Christ...

1306
01:19:04,226 --> 01:19:06,727
...would give people
a better understanding of God.

1307
01:19:06,895 --> 01:19:10,815
- Why would they leave any of it out?
- Because it's tied in with his family.

1308
01:19:10,982 --> 01:19:13,943
- His mother and father.
- His brothers and sisters.

1309
01:19:14,111 --> 01:19:18,280
Jesus didn't have brothers and sisters.
Mary was a virgin.

1310
01:19:18,448 --> 01:19:22,701
Mary gave birth to Christ without
knowing a man's touch. This is true.

1311
01:19:22,869 --> 01:19:24,703
But she did have a husband.

1312
01:19:24,871 --> 01:19:28,499
Do you really think he would've stayed
married to her for all those years...

1313
01:19:28,667 --> 01:19:30,167
...if he wasn't getting laid?

1314
01:19:30,335 --> 01:19:33,671
The nature of God and the virgin birth,
those are leaps of faith.

1315
01:19:33,839 --> 01:19:38,009
But to believe a married couple never
got down, that's just plain gullibility.

1316
01:19:38,177 --> 01:19:39,177
Meaning?

1317
01:19:39,345 --> 01:19:41,179
The blood that flows
through your veins...

1318
01:19:41,347 --> 01:19:43,974
...shares a chromosome or two
at the genetic level...

1319
01:19:44,142 --> 01:19:45,809
...with the one you call Jesus.

1320
01:19:46,936 --> 01:19:48,770
Bethany, you are...

1321
01:19:48,938 --> 01:19:52,232
...the great-great-great-great-
great-great-great-great...

1322
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:55,861
...great-great-grandniece
of Jesus Christ.

1323
01:19:59,824 --> 01:20:03,785
So that would make Bethany
part black?

1324
01:20:08,541 --> 01:20:10,500
I can't do this anymore.

1325
01:20:14,213 --> 01:20:18,884
Bethany, where you gonna go?
You know what I'm saying is right.

1326
01:20:19,051 --> 01:20:20,719
- It's bullshit.
- Bethany.

1327
01:20:20,887 --> 01:20:22,679
It's bullshit!

1328
01:20:26,476 --> 01:20:28,435
Let her go, man.

1329
01:20:28,603 --> 01:20:30,020
Give her time.

1330
01:20:37,403 --> 01:20:39,362
Why?!

1331
01:20:39,530 --> 01:20:42,365
What the fuck do you want
from me?

1332
01:20:42,533 --> 01:20:44,826
I fucking hate you!

1333
01:20:45,828 --> 01:20:47,412
I hate you.

1334
01:20:47,580 --> 01:20:49,748
He can't hear you, you know.

1335
01:20:55,589 --> 01:20:57,590
That's why we needed you.

1336
01:20:57,758 --> 01:20:59,926
Why didn't you tell me?

1337
01:21:00,093 --> 01:21:01,719
Would you...?

1338
01:21:02,304 --> 01:21:04,555
Could you have believed me?

1339
01:21:05,390 --> 01:21:07,850
It was something
you had to come to gradually.

1340
01:21:08,810 --> 01:21:11,562
Only after everything you've seen...

1341
01:21:12,105 --> 01:21:13,356
...everything you've heard...

1342
01:21:15,359 --> 01:21:18,402
...could you possibly be able
to accept the truth.

1343
01:21:18,946 --> 01:21:21,072
I don't want this.

1344
01:21:23,784 --> 01:21:25,785
It's too big.

1345
01:21:25,953 --> 01:21:27,537
That's what Jesus said.

1346
01:21:29,790 --> 01:21:31,707
I had to tell him.

1347
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:37,964
You can imagine
how that hurt the Father...

1348
01:21:39,007 --> 01:21:41,300
...not to be able
to tell the son himself...

1349
01:21:41,468 --> 01:21:44,470
...because one word from his lips
would destroy the boy's human form.

1350
01:21:44,638 --> 01:21:47,640
So I had to deliver the news
to a scared child...

1351
01:21:47,808 --> 01:21:50,434
...who wanted nothing more
than to play with other children.

1352
01:21:50,602 --> 01:21:54,313
I had to tell this little boy
that he was God's only son...

1353
01:21:54,481 --> 01:21:57,316
...and it meant a life of persecution
and eventual crucifixion...

1354
01:21:57,484 --> 01:22:00,611
...at the hands of the very people
he'd come to enlighten and redeem.

1355
01:22:02,864 --> 01:22:05,032
He begged me to take it all back.

1356
01:22:06,452 --> 01:22:07,995
As if I could.

1357
01:22:09,747 --> 01:22:12,499
He begged me to
"make it all not true."

1358
01:22:12,667 --> 01:22:17,004
I'll let you in on something, Bethany,
it's something I've never told anyone.

1359
01:22:18,923 --> 01:22:21,008
If I had the power...

1360
01:22:21,884 --> 01:22:23,260
...I would have.

1361
01:22:24,053 --> 01:22:25,178
It's unfair.

1362
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:28,932
It's unfair to ask a child
to shoulder that responsibility...

1363
01:22:29,100 --> 01:22:31,310
...and to ask you
to do the same now.

1364
01:22:31,477 --> 01:22:35,230
I sympathize. I do.
I wish I could take it all back.

1365
01:22:38,151 --> 01:22:39,735
But I can't.

1366
01:22:42,614 --> 01:22:44,031
This...

1367
01:22:45,283 --> 01:22:47,367
...is who you are.

1368
01:22:49,287 --> 01:22:51,830
Everything I am has been a lie?

1369
01:22:53,333 --> 01:22:55,208
No, no, no.

1370
01:22:55,918 --> 01:23:00,464
Knowing what you now know doesn't
mean you're not who you were.

1371
01:23:00,632 --> 01:23:03,342
You are Bethany Sloane.

1372
01:23:03,509 --> 01:23:06,928
No one can take that away from you,
not even God.

1373
01:23:08,264 --> 01:23:12,934
All this means is
a redefinition of that identity.

1374
01:23:13,102 --> 01:23:16,647
The incorporation of this new data
into who you are.

1375
01:23:16,814 --> 01:23:18,899
Be who you've always been.

1376
01:23:19,984 --> 01:23:21,151
Just...

1377
01:23:22,154 --> 01:23:24,197
...be this as well...

1378
01:23:25,532 --> 01:23:27,992
...from time to time.

1379
01:23:31,955 --> 01:23:34,499
Guess this means
no more cheating on my taxes.

1380
01:23:34,667 --> 01:23:36,834
To say the least.

1381
01:23:45,052 --> 01:23:47,553
Do you mind if we adjourn
to somewhere...

1382
01:23:47,721 --> 01:23:50,264
...a tad more habitable...

1383
01:23:50,432 --> 01:23:52,392
...and a bit warmer?

1384
01:24:06,824 --> 01:24:09,450
Fuck, man, I think this shit
Just kicked in.

1385
01:24:09,618 --> 01:24:12,412
Weren't we just in the woods?
What are we doing here now?

1386
01:24:12,579 --> 01:24:14,455
Going out in style.

1387
01:24:14,623 --> 01:24:17,125
- The voice.
- The apostle.

1388
01:24:17,292 --> 01:24:19,043
Now, who's this motherfucker?

1389
01:24:19,211 --> 01:24:21,295
It's the voice of God.
Show some respect.

1390
01:24:21,463 --> 01:24:23,798
Oh, the voice of God.
Where's the rest of him?

1391
01:24:23,966 --> 01:24:26,134
Funny you should mention that.
We're not sure.

1392
01:24:26,301 --> 01:24:28,970
- What?
- Come on. Didn't it ever occur to you...

1393
01:24:29,138 --> 01:24:33,099
...that this Bartleby-Loki situation was
well within the sphere of his control?

1394
01:24:33,267 --> 01:24:34,934
Yes, but then why was she tapped?

1395
01:24:35,102 --> 01:24:38,981
You know those constitutionals
that he likes to take?

1396
01:24:39,149 --> 01:24:40,315
"Constitutionals"?

1397
01:24:40,483 --> 01:24:42,901
I think we're beyond euphemisms
at this point.

1398
01:24:43,069 --> 01:24:44,903
God's a skeeball fanatic.

1399
01:24:46,281 --> 01:24:49,241
The Lord has a fancy for the game.
He's been playing it for years.

1400
01:24:49,409 --> 01:24:51,994
He assumes a human form
once a month and indulges.

1401
01:24:52,162 --> 01:24:55,080
Doesn't say where he's playing,
just goes away for a couple hours.

1402
01:24:55,248 --> 01:24:58,667
And he always gives his free points
away to neighborhood children.

1403
01:24:58,835 --> 01:25:00,169
Isn't that sweet?

1404
01:25:00,336 --> 01:25:03,839
But she hasn't come back from
one of these day trips, is that it?

1405
01:25:04,007 --> 01:25:06,300
No, she hasn't...

1406
01:25:06,468 --> 01:25:09,178
...and we've been
unable to locate her.

1407
01:25:09,345 --> 01:25:12,598
He could've been killed.
Human form does have that drawback.

1408
01:25:12,766 --> 01:25:17,019
No, there's a different sort
of foul play afoot, children.

1409
01:25:17,729 --> 01:25:21,190
Whomever has set
the renegade angels on their path...

1410
01:25:21,357 --> 01:25:23,692
...and is keeping them
quite well hidden...

1411
01:25:23,860 --> 01:25:26,737
...is also responsible
for the Lord's whereabouts.

1412
01:25:26,905 --> 01:25:29,072
Were he to be killed
in human form...

1413
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:31,825
...he'd have returned
immediately to heaven.

1414
01:25:31,993 --> 01:25:33,869
Someone knew enough...

1415
01:25:34,037 --> 01:25:36,079
...to keep him biologically alive...

1416
01:25:36,247 --> 01:25:39,124
...but incapacitate him
in another fashion.

1417
01:25:39,292 --> 01:25:41,960
And as omnipotent
as we are above...

1418
01:25:42,128 --> 01:25:45,506
...I have to admit that we're
more or less lost without his presence.

1419
01:25:45,673 --> 01:25:47,508
We've looked everywhere for him.

1420
01:25:47,675 --> 01:25:52,429
I tapped her because I thought we'd be
able to smoke out whoever's behind it.

1421
01:25:52,598 --> 01:25:55,809
But whoever he is was clever enough
to send some lackeys after you...

1422
01:25:55,976 --> 01:25:57,977
...as opposed to showing up
themselves.

1423
01:25:58,145 --> 01:25:59,813
Could it be Lucifer?

1424
01:25:59,980 --> 01:26:01,272
Not Lucifer.

1425
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:04,901
If he was, he'd have made
his move by now to conquer Heaven.

1426
01:26:05,069 --> 01:26:07,904
And I know he's not responsible
for Bartleby and Loki...

1427
01:26:08,072 --> 01:26:11,199
...because he has just as much to lose
by their return as anybody else.

1428
01:26:11,367 --> 01:26:12,742
So, what do we do now?

1429
01:26:12,910 --> 01:26:15,662
Well, I say we get drunk,
because I'm all out of ideas.

1430
01:26:15,830 --> 01:26:18,706
Why don't we just ask this guy
to close the church?

1431
01:26:19,375 --> 01:26:20,583
I beg your pardon?

1432
01:26:20,751 --> 01:26:22,669
It's the guy in charge
of the church thing.

1433
01:26:25,548 --> 01:26:27,340
Cardinal Glick?

1434
01:26:27,508 --> 01:26:29,592
Maybe we can ask him
to shut down the church.

1435
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:33,012
If it's closed that day, those guys
can't get blessed or whatever, right?

1436
01:26:33,180 --> 01:26:34,389
Good Lord.

1437
01:26:34,557 --> 01:26:36,516
The little stoner's got a point.

1438
01:26:36,684 --> 01:26:41,187
Maybe we could talk this guy Glick into
canceling the rededication ceremony.

1439
01:26:41,355 --> 01:26:43,273
"We"?

1440
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:46,442
Are you saying you're back in,
Ms. I Can't Do This Anymore?

1441
01:26:51,574 --> 01:26:54,117
I wouldn't want to let the family down,
now, would I?

1442
01:26:57,288 --> 01:26:59,080
Well...

1443
01:26:59,248 --> 01:27:02,959
...the prophets finally
live up to their titles.

1444
01:27:03,502 --> 01:27:06,212
Mass attendance is at
an all-time low in this country...

1445
01:27:06,380 --> 01:27:10,801
...but if we can let them know the
Catholic Church has a little panache...

1446
01:27:10,969 --> 01:27:13,929
...we can win them back,
even get some new ones.

1447
01:27:14,264 --> 01:27:15,598
Excuse me.

1448
01:27:17,726 --> 01:27:19,268
Fill them pews, people.

1449
01:27:19,436 --> 01:27:22,271
That's the key.
Grab the little ones as well.

1450
01:27:22,439 --> 01:27:24,815
Hook them while they're young.

1451
01:27:24,983 --> 01:27:29,069
- Kind of like the tobacco industry.
- Christ, if only we had their numbers.

1452
01:27:29,237 --> 01:27:32,281
We really appreciate you seeing us
so late in the day, Your Eminence.

1453
01:27:32,449 --> 01:27:35,951
My friends and I have been traveling
all night in hope of talking to you...

1454
01:27:36,119 --> 01:27:38,495
...about the St. Michael's
rededication ceremony.

1455
01:27:38,663 --> 01:27:41,081
So you looking to help out
in some way, I take it?

1456
01:27:41,249 --> 01:27:43,959
We'd like you to cancel
the ceremony.

1457
01:27:45,086 --> 01:27:46,670
I beg your pardon.

1458
01:27:46,838 --> 01:27:50,758
There's gonna be a world of trouble
if tomorrow's ceremony goes forward.

1459
01:27:51,885 --> 01:27:54,678
Are you pro-choice?

1460
01:27:54,846 --> 01:27:56,347
No, no. The trouble's not from us.

1461
01:27:56,514 --> 01:27:59,767
It's from renegade angels that have
been stuck on Earth since the plagues.

1462
01:28:02,562 --> 01:28:05,022
These guys,
they think they're renegade angels.

1463
01:28:05,190 --> 01:28:07,316
See, padre, it goes down like this.

1464
01:28:07,484 --> 01:28:10,110
These guys think that
by passing through that archway...

1465
01:28:10,278 --> 01:28:12,112
...they can go straight to heaven.

1466
01:28:12,280 --> 01:28:15,824
You want me to call off
the ceremony for that.

1467
01:28:16,952 --> 01:28:18,035
Who sent you?

1468
01:28:20,205 --> 01:28:23,165
We were sent
by him who is called I Am!

1469
01:28:23,333 --> 01:28:25,835
Cute. Really cute.

1470
01:28:26,003 --> 01:28:28,296
Kids, playtime with the cardinal
is over.

1471
01:28:28,464 --> 01:28:31,007
- Worked for Moses.
- Stay out of this.

1472
01:28:31,175 --> 01:28:32,717
Your Eminence, it's not a joke.

1473
01:28:32,885 --> 01:28:35,887
I'm telling you, man,
this ceremony's a big mistake.

1474
01:28:36,055 --> 01:28:38,890
The Catholic Church
does not make mistakes.

1475
01:28:39,058 --> 01:28:41,935
Please! What about the Church's
silent consent of the slave trade?

1476
01:28:42,103 --> 01:28:44,562
And its platform of noninvolvement
during the Holocaust?

1477
01:28:44,730 --> 01:28:47,065
All right, mistakes were made.

1478
01:28:47,233 --> 01:28:50,360
But one can hardly hold the current
incarnation of Holy Mother Church...

1479
01:28:50,528 --> 01:28:52,320
...responsible for
the oversights of old.

1480
01:28:52,488 --> 01:28:56,157
I'm an important man with important
matters that demand my attention...

1481
01:28:56,325 --> 01:28:57,742
...so if you please...

1482
01:28:57,910 --> 01:29:00,578
- But tomorrow...
- Tomorrow goes off without a hitch.

1483
01:29:00,746 --> 01:29:01,997
Do I make myself clear?

1484
01:29:02,164 --> 01:29:06,751
Neither you nor any other influence
short of the hand of God himself...

1485
01:29:06,919 --> 01:29:09,754
...is gonna keep this thing
from going off without a hitch.

1486
01:29:30,776 --> 01:29:32,777
I can see the headlines now...

1487
01:29:33,195 --> 01:29:34,779
...if there were gonna be any.

1488
01:29:34,947 --> 01:29:36,448
"Existence Erased."

1489
01:29:36,615 --> 01:29:38,783
Don't worry about it.
We evened the score.

1490
01:29:38,951 --> 01:29:41,203
Hand it over, Silent Bob.

1491
01:29:43,790 --> 01:29:44,874
What up?

1492
01:29:45,042 --> 01:29:47,209
You stole the cardinaI's driver?

1493
01:29:47,377 --> 01:29:51,297
That's what he gets for messing with
our girlfriend. Cross-dressing fuck.

1494
01:29:51,465 --> 01:29:54,175
That's sort of sweet.
Thanks, guys.

1495
01:29:55,635 --> 01:29:58,471
What do we do now
about Bartleby and Loki?

1496
01:29:58,638 --> 01:30:01,766
I guess we're gonna
have to try and kill them.

1497
01:30:01,933 --> 01:30:03,976
- You said they couldn't be killed.
- Correction.

1498
01:30:05,645 --> 01:30:08,314
They won't be killed.

1499
01:30:08,482 --> 01:30:11,442
And just to ensure that,
we're all gonna sit tight...

1500
01:30:11,610 --> 01:30:15,863
...right here, until those two idiots
pass through that arch.

1501
01:30:16,031 --> 01:30:19,658
Hey. There's only
one idiot here, Azrael...

1502
01:30:22,454 --> 01:30:24,538
...and I'm looking right at him.

1503
01:30:24,706 --> 01:30:26,165
Muse!

1504
01:30:27,542 --> 01:30:30,628
Just in time to join us for a drink.

1505
01:30:30,796 --> 01:30:33,172
Hey. Where'd you come from?

1506
01:30:35,133 --> 01:30:36,967
- Where'd you come from?
- Me?

1507
01:30:37,135 --> 01:30:38,552
Nothingness.

1508
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:42,348
And that's where I'm returning to
in approximately, oh, one hour.

1509
01:30:42,516 --> 01:30:46,018
All right, Plato, sounds like
you've had enough already.

1510
01:30:46,186 --> 01:30:48,562
- Let's go.
- Oh, darn it!

1511
01:30:48,730 --> 01:30:52,316
Come on, barkeep, just one drink.
One for the road, then I'm gone?

1512
01:30:52,484 --> 01:30:55,737
I was trying to find you to tell you
I figured out who was behind all this.

1513
01:30:55,905 --> 01:30:57,322
Is that who I think it is?

1514
01:30:57,490 --> 01:30:58,698
- None other than.
- Who is he?

1515
01:30:58,866 --> 01:31:01,535
All right, one drink.
Then you're gone.

1516
01:31:01,702 --> 01:31:03,787
Give me a...

1517
01:31:03,955 --> 01:31:06,331
...Holy Bartender.

1518
01:31:06,499 --> 01:31:08,291
Never heard of it.

1519
01:31:08,459 --> 01:31:12,212
He doesn't know how to make
a Holy Bartender.

1520
01:31:12,380 --> 01:31:14,214
You do, don't you, Muse?

1521
01:31:14,382 --> 01:31:15,382
Don't.

1522
01:31:16,551 --> 01:31:19,219
Anybody? No?

1523
01:31:19,637 --> 01:31:22,806
Well, I know how to make
a Holy Bartender.

1524
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:32,482
Get it?

1525
01:31:32,650 --> 01:31:34,818
Sweet Jesus, Azrael! Why?

1526
01:31:34,986 --> 01:31:38,405
Come on, demon! Try that shit
on somebody who's already dead!

1527
01:31:38,573 --> 01:31:41,908
Oh, apostle, you maintain
that kind of an attitude...

1528
01:31:42,076 --> 01:31:45,036
...and you and the barkeep won't be
the only corpses in the room.

1529
01:31:45,204 --> 01:31:47,247
The Christ bitch will join you.

1530
01:31:48,040 --> 01:31:50,500
Are you really that stupid?

1531
01:31:50,668 --> 01:31:54,087
You do know what's gonna happen
if those two jerks enter that church.

1532
01:31:54,255 --> 01:31:56,548
I'm actually counting on it.

1533
01:31:57,842 --> 01:31:59,926
And if my calculations
are correct...

1534
01:32:00,094 --> 01:32:02,762
...the pawns are moving
into checkmate as we speak.

1535
01:32:07,768 --> 01:32:11,272
"Holy Bartender." I get it.
That's a great one!

1536
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:15,568
I'd also like to acknowledge this great
state's governor, Elizabeth Dalton...

1537
01:32:15,736 --> 01:32:17,278
...for coming here this morning.

1538
01:32:17,446 --> 01:32:20,448
True, she's a Protestant, but we're
not gonna hold that against her.

1539
01:32:22,492 --> 01:32:26,787
Now, let me just tell you a little bit
of history about this particular...

1540
01:32:26,955 --> 01:32:29,540
...hundred-years-young
house of God.

1541
01:32:29,708 --> 01:32:30,917
God's house?

1542
01:32:32,377 --> 01:32:35,004
God doesn't live here anymore.

1543
01:32:35,172 --> 01:32:37,882
He's grown weary
of your superficial faith.

1544
01:32:38,050 --> 01:32:40,885
He's turned a deaf ear
to your lip-service prayers.

1545
01:32:41,053 --> 01:32:43,304
- He has abandoned you...
- Sorry.

1546
01:32:43,472 --> 01:32:46,307
...his favorites,
to the whim ofjudgment.

1547
01:32:46,475 --> 01:32:48,893
Hypocrites, charlatans...

1548
01:32:50,646 --> 01:32:53,147
...prepare to taste God's wrath.

1549
01:32:53,315 --> 01:32:54,523
Maybe we should just leave.

1550
01:32:54,691 --> 01:32:56,359
You wanted your body count.
You got it.

1551
01:32:56,526 --> 01:32:58,903
This lot is rife with sin.
We'll judge them all.

1552
01:32:59,071 --> 01:33:00,238
Officer McGhee.

1553
01:33:01,114 --> 01:33:02,823
All right, mouthpiece...

1554
01:33:02,991 --> 01:33:05,660
...let's leave the nice cardinal alone
and go for a ride.

1555
01:33:05,827 --> 01:33:08,162
Mr. McGhee, don't make me angry.

1556
01:33:08,330 --> 01:33:10,164
You wouldn't like me
when I'm angry.

1557
01:33:10,332 --> 01:33:12,083
Is that so?

1558
01:33:16,463 --> 01:33:18,130
Ladies and gentlemen...

1559
01:33:18,298 --> 01:33:23,678
...you have been judged as guilty of
violations against our Almighty God...

1560
01:33:23,845 --> 01:33:26,181
...and this very day...

1561
01:33:26,349 --> 01:33:30,018
...I assure you, you will all
pay for your trespasses...

1562
01:33:30,186 --> 01:33:31,853
...in blood.

1563
01:33:32,021 --> 01:33:34,189
- Wings. Now.
- I'm feeling a little exposed here.

1564
01:33:34,357 --> 01:33:35,357
Do it!

1565
01:33:36,651 --> 01:33:39,278
- So he's a muse too?
- Former muse.

1566
01:33:41,030 --> 01:33:44,366
He was kicked out.

1567
01:33:44,534 --> 01:33:46,868
Ever the fucking apple polisher.

1568
01:33:47,036 --> 01:33:48,036
Then what happened?

1569
01:33:48,204 --> 01:33:50,289
Yes, what?

1570
01:33:50,456 --> 01:33:54,334
Well, Lucifer just had to start
his little war for the throne.

1571
01:33:54,502 --> 01:33:56,962
Heaven became divided
into two factions...

1572
01:33:57,130 --> 01:33:59,214
...the faithful and the renegades.

1573
01:33:59,382 --> 01:34:02,134
Oh, the ethereal plains
were chaotic with battle.

1574
01:34:02,302 --> 01:34:05,012
Angel against angel.

1575
01:34:05,179 --> 01:34:08,515
And when it was all over,
God cast the rebels into perdition.

1576
01:34:08,683 --> 01:34:10,475
But Azrael refused to fight.

1577
01:34:10,643 --> 01:34:14,062
He remained in the middle, waiting
to see who came out victorious.

1578
01:34:14,230 --> 01:34:16,231
What are you,
some kind of fucking chicken?

1579
01:34:16,399 --> 01:34:17,733
No.

1580
01:34:17,900 --> 01:34:21,737
I was an artist, stupid!

1581
01:34:21,904 --> 01:34:23,447
I was inspiration!

1582
01:34:23,614 --> 01:34:26,033
A muse has no place in battle.

1583
01:34:26,200 --> 01:34:28,660
So after the fallen
were banished to hell...

1584
01:34:28,828 --> 01:34:30,829
...God turned on those
that wouldn't fight...

1585
01:34:30,997 --> 01:34:33,248
...and Azrael was sent down
with the demons...

1586
01:34:33,416 --> 01:34:36,126
...something he considers
a great injustice.

1587
01:34:36,294 --> 01:34:38,378
Oh, come on.

1588
01:34:38,546 --> 01:34:41,506
Don't tell me you never questioned
the judgment, Serendipity.

1589
01:34:41,675 --> 01:34:44,344
No. It never bothered me.

1590
01:34:44,511 --> 01:34:46,429
So you were an artist.

1591
01:34:46,597 --> 01:34:48,264
Big deal!

1592
01:34:48,432 --> 01:34:50,433
Elvis was an artist...

1593
01:34:50,601 --> 01:34:53,853
...but that didn't stop him from
joining the service in time of war.

1594
01:34:54,021 --> 01:34:55,855
That's why he is the king...

1595
01:34:56,023 --> 01:34:57,857
...and you're a schmuck.

1596
01:34:58,025 --> 01:34:59,108
Nice.

1597
01:34:59,276 --> 01:35:01,069
So all this is about revenge.

1598
01:35:01,236 --> 01:35:04,113
You're gonna unmake existence
because of a grudge against God?

1599
01:35:04,281 --> 01:35:07,950
After the first million years? No.

1600
01:35:08,118 --> 01:35:11,871
Escape from hell
became my all-consuming reason.

1601
01:35:12,039 --> 01:35:16,459
So I studied the religions and waited
for my opportunity to present itself...

1602
01:35:16,627 --> 01:35:18,044
...which it finally did...

1603
01:35:18,212 --> 01:35:20,088
...in Catholicism.

1604
01:35:20,255 --> 01:35:21,422
Plenary indulgence.

1605
01:35:21,590 --> 01:35:23,383
But I couldn't exercise it.

1606
01:35:23,550 --> 01:35:25,927
Demons can't become human.

1607
01:35:26,095 --> 01:35:28,137
No, we can't transubstantiate.

1608
01:35:29,723 --> 01:35:31,099
But angels can.

1609
01:35:32,434 --> 01:35:33,643
Bartleby and Loki.

1610
01:35:35,479 --> 01:35:38,398
After that it was a simple matter
of waiting for a church...

1611
01:35:38,565 --> 01:35:40,274
...to celebrate their centennial...

1612
01:35:40,442 --> 01:35:45,988
...and when it finally happened I sent
the pair an article laced with ideas.

1613
01:35:46,156 --> 01:35:47,990
An incantation
I picked up in the pit...

1614
01:35:48,158 --> 01:35:50,159
...kept them cloaked
and off heaven's radars.

1615
01:35:50,327 --> 01:35:53,413
And aside from the triplets here
and the Golgothan...

1616
01:35:53,580 --> 01:35:57,292
...no soul in hell had a clue
as to what was going on.

1617
01:35:57,460 --> 01:36:00,337
But the Almighty
could still putsch the whole deal...

1618
01:36:00,505 --> 01:36:03,924
...so I dispatched him
in a fairly ingenious fashion.

1619
01:36:04,092 --> 01:36:06,427
Her. And how?

1620
01:36:06,594 --> 01:36:09,096
That's the only thing
I couldn't figure out.

1621
01:36:09,264 --> 01:36:12,099
Oh, no, I've seen way too many
Bond movies to know...

1622
01:36:12,267 --> 01:36:15,102
...that you never reveal
all the details of your plan...

1623
01:36:15,270 --> 01:36:18,605
...no matter how close
you may think you are to winning.

1624
01:36:18,773 --> 01:36:21,859
The only X factor was the involvement
of the last scion here.

1625
01:36:22,694 --> 01:36:27,322
But fat lot of good that did, right?
I mean, here you all are.

1626
01:36:30,160 --> 01:36:33,287
Powerless to stop the inevitable.

1627
01:36:33,455 --> 01:36:37,458
Look, asshole, I don't know
if anyone explained the rules to you...

1628
01:36:37,625 --> 01:36:41,462
...but if you succeed everything gets
blinked out of existence, even you.

1629
01:36:41,629 --> 01:36:44,506
Human, have you ever
been to hell?

1630
01:36:44,674 --> 01:36:46,717
I think not.

1631
01:36:46,885 --> 01:36:49,052
I'd rather not exist
than go back to that.

1632
01:36:49,220 --> 01:36:53,515
And if everyone has to
go down with me, so be it.

1633
01:36:53,683 --> 01:36:56,059
Still thinking only about yourself...

1634
01:36:56,227 --> 01:36:58,061
...you fucking child!

1635
01:36:58,229 --> 01:37:00,314
Now, now, now.

1636
01:37:01,191 --> 01:37:04,193
Things are getting
too intense in here.

1637
01:37:04,360 --> 01:37:06,820
Hey! What say
we watch a little TV?

1638
01:37:06,988 --> 01:37:08,906
Yo, put on Channel 9.
Davey and Goliath.

1639
01:37:10,366 --> 01:37:14,662
Actually, I was thinking more
along the lines of current events.

1640
01:37:14,830 --> 01:37:17,165
Keep rolling! Keep rolling!

1641
01:37:17,333 --> 01:37:20,084
I repeat,
men with huge fucking wings...

1642
01:37:20,252 --> 01:37:22,295
...have laid waste to St. Michael's!

1643
01:37:22,463 --> 01:37:24,797
Bullets don't seem to affect them!

1644
01:37:25,591 --> 01:37:28,468
The remainder of the crowd
have dropped to their knees...

1645
01:37:28,636 --> 01:37:30,929
...identifying this
as the fabled apocalypse.

1646
01:37:31,096 --> 01:37:33,890
Now, I'm not a man of faith,
but I'm inclined to agree.

1647
01:37:34,058 --> 01:37:38,186
God, please, don't come any closer!
Don't come any closer! God, no!

1648
01:37:38,437 --> 01:37:40,021
No!

1649
01:37:46,278 --> 01:37:49,447
You see that?
And I told them to keep a low profile.

1650
01:37:49,615 --> 01:37:53,117
I'd be pissed, but in a couple minutes
it's not gonna matter anyway.

1651
01:37:59,875 --> 01:38:02,210
Oh, now what was that
all about?

1652
01:38:02,378 --> 01:38:03,878
What?

1653
01:38:04,046 --> 01:38:06,464
Oh, nothing.

1654
01:38:06,632 --> 01:38:08,716
I had something in my eye.

1655
01:38:08,884 --> 01:38:11,553
Now who's the fucking child?

1656
01:38:12,763 --> 01:38:15,932
What did you tell him,
to hit me with the golf club?

1657
01:38:16,642 --> 01:38:18,351
Are you serious?
I'm a fucking demon.

1658
01:38:18,519 --> 01:38:20,270
You'd have him assault me
with a putter?

1659
01:38:21,397 --> 01:38:23,398
You want to play? Then we'll play.

1660
01:38:23,566 --> 01:38:25,275
One side, Red.

1661
01:38:26,026 --> 01:38:28,946
Go ahead, then. Pick it up.
Call it a gift.

1662
01:38:30,448 --> 01:38:32,366
Come on.

1663
01:38:32,534 --> 01:38:33,951
That's it.

1664
01:38:35,745 --> 01:38:36,996
Take a shot.

1665
01:38:37,163 --> 01:38:40,666
Take your best fucking shot.

1666
01:38:42,210 --> 01:38:45,170
Seriously. I'm not kidding.
Take it. Come on.

1667
01:38:45,797 --> 01:38:48,048
Come on, bright boy.

1668
01:38:55,890 --> 01:38:58,309
Don't you know anything?

1669
01:39:13,825 --> 01:39:15,701
Bethany, bless the sink!

1670
01:39:15,869 --> 01:39:17,661
- What?
- Just do it!

1671
01:39:17,829 --> 01:39:19,705
Bless the sink, damn it!

1672
01:39:44,065 --> 01:39:46,191
That's what you get, motherfucker.

1673
01:39:48,819 --> 01:39:50,904
But I'm a fucking demon.

1674
01:39:58,245 --> 01:39:59,496
What just happened?

1675
01:39:59,664 --> 01:40:02,207
He said it himself:
"I'm a fucking demon."

1676
01:40:02,375 --> 01:40:06,670
Hit a demon with an instrument of God,
the pure side will do the most damage.

1677
01:40:06,837 --> 01:40:08,755
Holy shit!
Silent Bob's an instrument of God?

1678
01:40:08,923 --> 01:40:12,759
No, but Glick's the kind of asshole
who'd bless his clubs for a better game.

1679
01:40:12,927 --> 01:40:15,929
- But the sink?
- You've got the divine heritage.

1680
01:40:16,097 --> 01:40:18,181
Sanctifying is just
one of the fringe benefits.

1681
01:40:18,349 --> 01:40:20,892
Remind me to try the water-to-wine
thing at my next party.

1682
01:40:21,060 --> 01:40:23,853
- How far away is this church?
- Three towns over, about 10 miles.

1683
01:40:24,021 --> 01:40:26,022
- Rufus, grab the gun.
- Ten steps ahead of you.

1684
01:40:26,190 --> 01:40:28,358
Take the bartender's car.
He won't need it.

1685
01:40:28,526 --> 01:40:31,778
The whole fucking world's against us,
dude, I swear to God.

1686
01:40:43,499 --> 01:40:45,208
Oh, my God.

1687
01:40:57,972 --> 01:41:00,641
And people wonder why
I don't go to church anymore.

1688
01:41:00,809 --> 01:41:01,976
Are we too late?

1689
01:41:02,144 --> 01:41:04,645
To save these poor schmucks?

1690
01:41:06,481 --> 01:41:07,523
Yeah.

1691
01:41:07,691 --> 01:41:10,276
But we still exist.

1692
01:41:10,444 --> 01:41:12,153
Where are they?

1693
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:14,739
They could already be
in the church.

1694
01:41:14,906 --> 01:41:16,949
So if they come out,
nobody touches them.

1695
01:41:17,117 --> 01:41:18,325
Are you fucking shitting me?

1696
01:41:18,493 --> 01:41:21,328
The brother is gonna shred them
with his angel-be-good special...

1697
01:41:21,496 --> 01:41:22,496
...ain't you, homey?

1698
01:41:22,664 --> 01:41:24,665
If they pass through that arch,
they're clean.

1699
01:41:24,833 --> 01:41:26,751
And if they die, they go straight up.

1700
01:41:26,918 --> 01:41:29,253
And, hello!
We know what happens then, right?

1701
01:41:29,421 --> 01:41:31,672
- Why don't they kill themselves?
- It's a mortal sin.

1702
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:34,675
Die with a mortal sin and you burn.
They don't wanna go to hell.

1703
01:41:34,843 --> 01:41:38,512
Then what are we supposed to do,
wait for a solution to fall from the sky?

1704
01:41:42,809 --> 01:41:44,101
Friend of yours?

1705
01:41:44,269 --> 01:41:46,145
No, that was a cardinal.

1706
01:41:46,313 --> 01:41:50,024
You can't tell from his face,
but the rosaries are a dead giveaway.

1707
01:41:50,192 --> 01:41:52,693
It's one of them!
Kill that motherfucker!

1708
01:41:52,861 --> 01:41:54,028
Don't you listen?

1709
01:41:54,196 --> 01:41:57,114
- We can't touch him!
- I wasn't. I was gonna shoot his ass.

1710
01:41:57,282 --> 01:41:59,450
He's been at it for a while now.

1711
01:41:59,618 --> 01:42:01,202
Please! Please!

1712
01:42:02,370 --> 01:42:04,205
We ran out of parishioners...

1713
01:42:04,372 --> 01:42:08,667
...so he just started picking up folk
off the road and just dropping them.

1714
01:42:08,835 --> 01:42:11,962
This is just eons of repression
getting purged.

1715
01:42:13,006 --> 01:42:15,049
If only they'd let us jerk off,
you know?

1716
01:42:16,969 --> 01:42:18,220
Take a step back.

1717
01:42:22,600 --> 01:42:24,017
Let me go!

1718
01:42:25,228 --> 01:42:27,395
Why? What are you trying to prove?

1719
01:42:27,563 --> 01:42:30,899
- All these people!
- Hey, this wasn't my idea!

1720
01:42:32,026 --> 01:42:33,360
Jesus Christ!

1721
01:42:34,737 --> 01:42:36,571
I just wanted to go home.

1722
01:42:36,739 --> 01:42:38,532
But him, you know...

1723
01:42:38,699 --> 01:42:40,992
...he just lost it.

1724
01:42:41,160 --> 01:42:44,246
He realized who you were
and what you were gonna have to do.

1725
01:42:44,413 --> 01:42:45,831
He just snapped.

1726
01:42:45,998 --> 01:42:49,501
And the funny thing is, this guy could
never even stand to see me work.

1727
01:42:49,669 --> 01:42:52,712
He said he felt sorry
for you people.

1728
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:55,257
Now look at him.

1729
01:42:55,424 --> 01:42:57,425
This guy's fucking drunker
than hell.

1730
01:42:57,593 --> 01:43:00,011
Which means he's human now.

1731
01:43:01,430 --> 01:43:03,515
His wings have been cut off.

1732
01:43:04,016 --> 01:43:05,600
Loki...

1733
01:43:08,229 --> 01:43:09,938
Loki.

1734
01:43:10,106 --> 01:43:11,982
The muse?

1735
01:43:12,149 --> 01:43:14,192
Oh, no way!

1736
01:43:14,360 --> 01:43:17,070
I haven't seen you...
You look terrific.

1737
01:43:17,238 --> 01:43:19,281
What's with the tits? Can I...

1738
01:43:19,448 --> 01:43:21,616
Have you walked
through the arch yet?

1739
01:43:25,037 --> 01:43:28,540
Tell me. Have you gone in and
come out through the archway yet?

1740
01:43:28,708 --> 01:43:29,958
No!

1741
01:43:35,382 --> 01:43:36,465
He's back.

1742
01:43:59,865 --> 01:44:01,782
We were awaiting your arrival.

1743
01:44:01,950 --> 01:44:04,911
Bartleby, wait. Stop. Listen to me.

1744
01:44:05,078 --> 01:44:07,663
You can't go through with this.
Azrael was just using you.

1745
01:44:07,831 --> 01:44:08,998
If you go back...

1746
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:11,709
I've become aware
of the repercussions.

1747
01:44:11,877 --> 01:44:12,919
I know what I'm doing.

1748
01:44:14,463 --> 01:44:16,005
You sick, twisted fuck!

1749
01:44:17,674 --> 01:44:18,841
Bethany.

1750
01:44:22,095 --> 01:44:25,348
You, of all people, should understand
what I'm trying to accomplish here.

1751
01:44:25,515 --> 01:44:28,351
You too know what it feels like
to be cast aside.

1752
01:44:28,518 --> 01:44:31,520
But you've only dealt with the pain
a few years.

1753
01:44:31,688 --> 01:44:34,106
I've dealt with it for a millennia.

1754
01:44:34,274 --> 01:44:36,359
And while you never see
your ex-husband...

1755
01:44:36,526 --> 01:44:39,862
...or how blissful he is
with his new wife...

1756
01:44:40,822 --> 01:44:42,031
And he is.

1757
01:44:45,243 --> 01:44:49,957
- seeing you people every day on this
perfect world he created for you...

1758
01:44:50,124 --> 01:44:51,708
...is a constant reminder...

1759
01:44:51,876 --> 01:44:54,878
...that though my kind came first...

1760
01:44:55,046 --> 01:44:57,631
...your kind was most revered.

1761
01:44:58,341 --> 01:45:00,634
And while you know forgiveness...

1762
01:45:00,802 --> 01:45:02,719
...we know only regret.

1763
01:45:04,180 --> 01:45:05,555
The lesson must be taught.

1764
01:45:05,723 --> 01:45:07,474
All are accountable...

1765
01:45:07,642 --> 01:45:08,892
...even God.

1766
01:45:10,228 --> 01:45:12,354
Soon a cadre of police will arrive...

1767
01:45:12,522 --> 01:45:16,233
...just in time to kill us
as we exit the church.

1768
01:45:16,985 --> 01:45:20,404
Then this failed experiment
called existence...

1769
01:45:20,571 --> 01:45:21,989
...will cease to be.

1770
01:45:22,156 --> 01:45:23,657
No. Hey. Hey!

1771
01:45:24,325 --> 01:45:26,243
No. No.

1772
01:45:26,411 --> 01:45:28,245
I can't let you do that, Bartleby.

1773
01:45:28,746 --> 01:45:30,414
This has gone too far.

1774
01:45:32,542 --> 01:45:34,918
I might have to take you down.

1775
01:45:36,421 --> 01:45:38,213
It's okay.

1776
01:45:38,381 --> 01:45:39,923
I'll do it.

1777
01:45:44,721 --> 01:45:46,596
My compatriot.

1778
01:45:48,057 --> 01:45:50,475
Genocide takes a lot out of him.

1779
01:45:50,643 --> 01:45:51,852
He's weakened.

1780
01:45:52,020 --> 01:45:53,353
You're weak.

1781
01:45:53,521 --> 01:45:56,273
More importantly,
he's also a human being...

1782
01:45:56,441 --> 01:45:58,567
...a condition which carries
two liabilities.

1783
01:46:00,403 --> 01:46:02,196
A conscience...

1784
01:46:02,990 --> 01:46:04,449
...and...

1785
01:46:07,453 --> 01:46:09,954
...a short life span.

1786
01:46:10,122 --> 01:46:12,874
I'm sorry, old friend,
but you lost the faith.

1787
01:46:40,652 --> 01:46:42,570
Oh, my God. He's lost it.
We're fucked.

1788
01:46:42,738 --> 01:46:44,947
- We're absolutely fucked!
- I hear that shit.

1789
01:46:46,408 --> 01:46:47,742
I can't believe this shit.

1790
01:46:47,910 --> 01:46:50,495
We're on the brink of nonexistence
and God's still missing.

1791
01:46:50,662 --> 01:46:53,623
- What kind of deity gets kidnapped?
- Amen to that.

1792
01:47:00,506 --> 01:47:02,632
What the hell are you doing?

1793
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:06,177
If the whole world's gonna end,
you said you'd fuck me.

1794
01:47:10,349 --> 01:47:13,184
- You're a pig.
- Nobody's gonna beat that thing.

1795
01:47:13,352 --> 01:47:16,854
We can lay here all comatose like that
John Doe Jersey bastard over there...

1796
01:47:17,022 --> 01:47:19,858
...or we can get making with the love.
- What did you say?

1797
01:47:20,026 --> 01:47:22,027
Make with the love.
It's a nice way of saying boning.

1798
01:47:22,195 --> 01:47:23,654
No, about John Doe Jersey.

1799
01:47:27,534 --> 01:47:30,369
That guy they won't take off
life support, John Doe Jersey.

1800
01:47:30,537 --> 01:47:32,538
This is where he's at,
St. Michael's Hospital.

1801
01:47:34,207 --> 01:47:35,541
Where's the nearest boardwalk?

1802
01:47:35,708 --> 01:47:38,293
I ain't got time to win you a prize.
We gotta get to the fucking.

1803
01:47:38,461 --> 01:47:40,838
- Where is it?
- Asbury Park, about five miles away.

1804
01:47:41,005 --> 01:47:42,881
- Have you been there?
- Once, with a chick.

1805
01:47:43,049 --> 01:47:46,051
We were about to fuck on the carousel
and I got sick, started puking.

1806
01:47:46,219 --> 01:47:48,011
- Do they have skeeball there?
- Yeah.

1807
01:47:51,516 --> 01:47:53,392
That's what I'm talking about.

1808
01:48:01,401 --> 01:48:04,403
Whatever you do, stall Bartleby
from going into that church.

1809
01:48:04,571 --> 01:48:06,655
Bob, come with me. Come on!

1810
01:48:06,823 --> 01:48:09,408
- How am I supposed to do that?
- Think of something!

1811
01:48:09,576 --> 01:48:11,743
I already did, but it takes two of us!

1812
01:48:12,620 --> 01:48:14,830
I repeat, this is not a drill.

1813
01:48:14,998 --> 01:48:16,665
This is the apocalypse.

1814
01:48:16,833 --> 01:48:19,501
Please exit the hospital
in an orderly fashion.

1815
01:48:19,669 --> 01:48:21,336
Thank you.

1816
01:48:36,770 --> 01:48:38,396
Hey, Big Bird!

1817
01:48:39,356 --> 01:48:40,940
Ready for the counting game?

1818
01:48:41,108 --> 01:48:42,692
No!

1819
01:48:45,779 --> 01:48:47,697
Count the shells, Suck-a-Duck.

1820
01:49:15,935 --> 01:49:17,810
No more bullets.

1821
01:49:17,978 --> 01:49:20,104
Now, what the fuck
would you do that for?

1822
01:49:20,272 --> 01:49:23,107
Angels have to cut their wings off
to become human.

1823
01:49:23,275 --> 01:49:25,276
You just did him a favor, stupid!

1824
01:50:12,033 --> 01:50:14,702
I hope you're the skeeball type.

1825
01:50:55,869 --> 01:50:58,245
Oh, Bartleby.

1826
01:50:58,413 --> 01:51:01,999
Was Wisconsin really that bad?

1827
01:51:02,167 --> 01:51:04,168
Bow down, stupid!

1828
01:51:22,772 --> 01:51:24,689
I'm sorry.

1829
01:51:47,546 --> 01:51:50,215
Anyone who isn't dead
or from another plane of existence...

1830
01:51:50,383 --> 01:51:54,094
...would do well to cover their ears
right about now.

1831
01:51:54,261 --> 01:51:56,221
What the fuck?

1832
01:52:02,395 --> 01:52:04,396
Thank you.

1833
01:52:36,221 --> 01:52:38,180
It never ends!

1834
01:52:57,909 --> 01:52:59,994
Get off of me.
I wanna see what's up.

1835
01:53:00,537 --> 01:53:02,538
What the fuck is this shit?

1836
01:53:02,706 --> 01:53:04,331
Who the fuck are you, Lady?

1837
01:53:04,499 --> 01:53:06,876
Why the fuck did you hug my head?

1838
01:53:07,043 --> 01:53:09,879
Quite a little mouth on him,
isn't there?

1839
01:53:10,046 --> 01:53:12,882
What the fuck is this, The Piano?
Why ain't this broad talking?

1840
01:53:13,049 --> 01:53:18,345
I believe the answers that you seek
lie within my companion's eyes.

1841
01:53:18,513 --> 01:53:21,682
What the fuck does that mean?
Has everyone gone fucking nuts?

1842
01:53:21,850 --> 01:53:24,727
What the fuck happened
to that guy's head? I want some...

1843
01:53:42,371 --> 01:53:44,039
Where was she?

1844
01:53:44,749 --> 01:53:46,666
Imprisoned in a body.

1845
01:53:46,834 --> 01:53:50,170
Bethany figured it all out.
She's a clever girl, that one.

1846
01:53:51,214 --> 01:53:52,756
Hang on a minute.

1847
01:54:27,291 --> 01:54:29,209
You missed a bit.

1848
01:54:30,753 --> 01:54:33,630
Well, then, you ready
to go back, apostle?

1849
01:54:33,798 --> 01:54:36,132
You ready to make those changes
I been talking about?

1850
01:54:36,467 --> 01:54:39,052
We'll see. Muse?

1851
01:54:39,220 --> 01:54:41,680
Seeing as how you
just had to get involved...

1852
01:54:41,847 --> 01:54:44,057
...you're welcome
to return with us as well.

1853
01:54:44,225 --> 01:54:47,018
First I gotta say goodbye to Bethany.
Where is she?

1854
01:54:47,186 --> 01:54:48,603
Oh, no.

1855
01:55:09,835 --> 01:55:12,295
Metatron, is she...?

1856
01:55:12,462 --> 01:55:14,672
Afraid so.

1857
01:55:14,840 --> 01:55:18,718
One of the drawbacks to being
a martyr is that you have to die.

1858
01:55:18,885 --> 01:55:20,845
But no matter.

1859
01:55:30,939 --> 01:55:33,274
All is being taken care of.

1860
01:55:34,026 --> 01:55:35,735
How so?

1861
01:55:36,528 --> 01:55:39,655
Wax on, wax off.

1862
01:56:03,221 --> 01:56:04,305
How did I...?

1863
01:56:04,473 --> 01:56:06,057
She can rebuild you.

1864
01:56:06,224 --> 01:56:07,726
She has the technology.

1865
01:56:07,894 --> 01:56:11,897
She can make you better,
stronger, faster.

1866
01:56:17,904 --> 01:56:19,237
That's...

1867
01:56:20,281 --> 01:56:23,075
A very relieved deity.

1868
01:56:24,410 --> 01:56:27,162
You did well, little girl.
I knew you'd come around.

1869
01:56:27,705 --> 01:56:29,665
Your kind always does.

1870
01:56:30,917 --> 01:56:33,335
So you might wanna
take good care of yourself.

1871
01:56:33,503 --> 01:56:36,171
We're gonna need you
down the road.

1872
01:56:36,339 --> 01:56:39,216
I know. I'm the last scion.

1873
01:56:41,427 --> 01:56:44,513
Well, you're half right.

1874
01:56:44,681 --> 01:56:47,599
You were the last scion.

1875
01:56:49,394 --> 01:56:51,103
But now...

1876
01:56:51,813 --> 01:56:53,355
...this...

1877
01:56:54,107 --> 01:56:56,108
...is the last scion.

1878
01:56:59,237 --> 01:57:01,154
I'm pregnant?

1879
01:57:03,700 --> 01:57:05,617
Can't put anything past you.

1880
01:57:08,955 --> 01:57:11,456
Take care of that parcel for us.

1881
01:57:11,624 --> 01:57:15,460
She has a world of work
ahead of her.

1882
01:57:26,974 --> 01:57:28,933
Thank you for...

1883
01:57:29,101 --> 01:57:30,977
...I don't know...

1884
01:57:31,145 --> 01:57:32,311
...everything.

1885
01:57:36,150 --> 01:57:39,485
God, there's a million things
I wish I could ask you...

1886
01:57:39,653 --> 01:57:41,654
...most of it questioning
your great plan...

1887
01:57:41,822 --> 01:57:43,656
...and that'd be arrogant of me,
I know.

1888
01:57:44,491 --> 01:57:46,576
But there is one I need to ask.

1889
01:57:46,744 --> 01:57:50,288
I'm sure you get it all the time, but
how many chances like this will I get?

1890
01:57:52,332 --> 01:57:54,167
Why are we here?

1891
01:58:11,185 --> 01:58:13,770
Didn't I tell you she was funny?

1892
01:58:20,652 --> 01:58:23,196
I really enjoyed meeting you.

1893
01:58:23,989 --> 01:58:26,115
It was an honor.

1894
01:58:30,829 --> 01:58:34,081
You did so well.

1895
01:58:38,546 --> 01:58:41,298
I told you she was a woman.

1896
01:58:43,301 --> 01:58:45,594
She's not really a woman.

1897
01:58:45,762 --> 01:58:48,138
She's not really anything.

1898
01:58:48,306 --> 01:58:50,390
She's something, all right.

1899
01:58:51,142 --> 01:58:53,310
Crisis of faith over?

1900
01:58:53,478 --> 01:58:56,313
I think I'm now burdened
with an overabundance.

1901
01:58:56,481 --> 01:58:58,315
When it rains, it pours.

1902
01:58:58,483 --> 01:59:00,692
Are you saying you believe?

1903
01:59:00,860 --> 01:59:03,904
No. But I have a good idea.

1904
01:59:04,072 --> 01:59:05,656
Yes.

1905
01:59:09,494 --> 01:59:11,286
The man was right about you.

1906
01:59:11,454 --> 01:59:14,456
Now I'm gonna go home
and tell him so.

1907
01:59:15,375 --> 01:59:17,251
And if you clean up your language...

1908
01:59:17,418 --> 01:59:19,753
...I just might put in
a good word for you too.

1909
01:59:20,421 --> 01:59:21,839
Thanks.

1910
01:59:23,383 --> 01:59:25,926
Why don't you name the kid
after me?

1911
01:59:28,304 --> 01:59:30,055
Rufus.

1912
01:59:56,542 --> 01:59:58,918
Yo, we should go to Quick Stop.

1913
02:00:03,757 --> 02:00:05,633
You guys wanna
hear something sick?

1914
02:00:05,801 --> 02:00:08,636
- I got half a stalk when she kissed me.
- Jay!

1915
02:00:08,804 --> 02:00:11,139
I couldn't help it. The bitch was hot.

1916
02:00:11,307 --> 02:00:15,768
You can't talk to me that way anymore.
I'm gonna be somebody's mother.

1917
02:00:15,936 --> 02:00:17,395
You're pregnant?

1918
02:00:19,064 --> 02:00:22,525
Yo, I heard pregnant women can
have sex into their third trimester.

1919
02:00:22,693 --> 02:00:24,611
I'll keep that in mind.

1920
02:08:04,619 --> 02:08:08,538
So that would make Bethany
part black?
