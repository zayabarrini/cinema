12
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,316
Hello, Mrs. MacGruder.

13
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,484
Oh, hello,
Miss Daniels.

14
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:34,654
Have you ever seen
so many gulls?
What do you suppose it is?

15
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:38,783
There must be a storm
at sea. That can drive
them inland, you know.

16
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:42,370
I was hoping you'd be
a little late. You see,
he hasn't arrived yet.

17
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:44,413
Oh, but you said 3:00.
Oh, I know.

18
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:47,291
I know. I've been
calling all morning.

19
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:49,627
Oh, Miss Daniels,
you have no idea.

20
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:52,463
They are so
difficult to get.
Really, they are.

21
00:02:52,548 --> 00:02:53,756
We have to get them
from India,

22
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:55,341
when they're just
baby chicks, and then...

23
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,385
This one won't be
a chick, will he?

24
00:02:57,553 --> 00:02:59,887
Certainly not.
Oh, no, certainly not.

25
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:01,806
This will be
a full-grown mynah bird.
Full-grown.

26
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:03,516
And he'll talk?

27
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,768
Well, yes,
of course he'll...

28
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:09,230
Well, no, you'll have
to teach him to talk.

29
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:13,401
I guess maybe
I'd better phone.
They said 3:00.

30
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:16,237
Maybe it's the traffic.
I'll call.

31
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:17,613
Would you mind waiting?

32
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:19,824
Well, maybe you'd
better deliver him.

33
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,868
Let me give you my address.

Yes. What is it
you're looking for, sir?

42
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:02,909
Lovebirds.

43
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:04,493
Lovebirds, sir?

44
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,537
Yes. I understand there
are different varieties.

45
00:04:06,622 --> 00:04:07,622
Is that true?

46
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:08,915
Well, yes, there are.

47
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:11,876
Well, these are for my sister
for her birthday, you see,

48
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,836
and as she's
only gonna be 11,

49
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:15,087
I wouldn't want
a pair of birds

50
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:17,798
that were
too demonstrative.

51
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:19,175
I understand completely.

52
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,011
At the same time,
I wouldn't want them
to be too aloof, either.

53
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,763
No, of course not.

54
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:27,016
Do you happen to have
a pair of birds
that are just friendly?

55
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:31,896
Oh, I think so.
Now, then, let me see.

56
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:38,319
Aren't those lovebirds?

57
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:42,073
No. Those are red birds.

58
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:44,575
I thought they were
strawberry finches.

59
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,203
Yes. We call them that, too.

60
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:51,290
Here we are. Lovebirds.

61
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:54,877
Those are canaries.

62
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:57,296
Doesn't this
make you feel awful?

63
00:04:57,381 --> 00:04:58,798
Doesn't what
make me feel...

64
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:02,093
Having all these poor,
little innocent creatures
caged up like this?

65
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:04,971
Well, we can't just let them
fly around the shop,
you know.

66
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:06,180
(CHUCKLING)
No, I suppose not.

67
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,307
Is there
an ornithological reason

68
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:10,476
for keeping them
in separate cages?

69
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,812
Well, certainly.
It's to protect
the species.

70
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:15,481
Yes, that's important,
especially during
the molting season.

71
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:18,234
That's a particularly
dangerous time.

72
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,194
Are they molting now?

73
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,737
Oh, some of them are.

74
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:23,322
How can you tell?

75
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:28,995
Well, they get a sort
of hangdog expression.

76
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:34,667
Yes, I see.
Well, what about
the lovebirds?

77
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,003
Are you sure
you wouldn't like to see
a canary instead?

78
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:39,505

nice canaries this week.

79

a parallel, Miss Daniels.

know my name?

We never met in court
or anyplace else.

97

99

Don't you remember
one of your practical jokes

100
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,917
that resulted in the smashing
of a plate-glass window?

101
00:06:58,001 --> 00:06:59,919
I didn't break
that window.

102
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:01,545
Yes, but your
little prank did.

103
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,422

put you behind bars.

105
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,968

the law, Miss Daniels.

106

on practical jokers.

108

Oh, I really wanted
the lovebirds.

00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:16,644
Well, you knew
I didn't work here.
You deliberately...

110
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:18,771
Right. I recognized
you when I came in.

111
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,523
I just thought you
might like to know

112
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,233
what it's like to be on
the other end of a gag.

113

think of that?

Why, Charlie, darling,
would I try to pressure you?

133
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:51,030
Would you call the Department
of Motor Vehicles for me?

143
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:25,064

you want them?

145
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,734

probably have them here

Yes.

leave them in the hall,
do you?

348
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:58,593
Oh, you mean,
you came all this way
to bring me those birds?

349
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:00,678
To bring your
sister those birds.

350
00:28:00,763 --> 00:28:02,388
You said it was
her birthday.

351
00:28:02,473 --> 00:28:03,931
Besides,
I was coming up anyway.

352
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:06,517
What for?

353
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:09,687
To see a friend
of mine. Careful.

354
00:28:09,772 --> 00:28:13,816
Oh, sorry.
Who's your friend?

355
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:17,695
Annie Hayworth,
the schoolteacher.

356
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,322
Annie Hayworth.

357
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:22,658
Well, small world.

358
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:24,702
Yes.

359
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:28,581
How do you know Annie?

360
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:32,668
We went to school
together, college.

361
00:28:32,753 --> 00:28:37,298
Did you? Lmagine that.
How long are you
staying up here?

362
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:39,967
The weekend.

363
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:45,139
Well, I think
the bleeding's almost stopped.
Why don't you hold that on?

364
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:55,483
So you came up
to see Annie, huh?

365
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,402
Yes.

366
00:28:57,486 --> 00:28:58,694
I think you
came up to see me.

367
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:01,531
Now, why would I want
to see you of all people?

368
00:29:01,615 --> 00:29:04,242
I don't know,
but you must've gone
to a lot of trouble

369
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:06,369
to find out who I was
and where I lived.

370
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:09,372
It was no trouble at all.
I simply called my
father's newspaper.

371
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:13,126
Besides,
I was coming up anyway.
I've already told you that.

372
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,293
You really like me, huh?

373
00:29:14,378 --> 00:29:16,170
I loathe you.

374
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:19,882
You have no manners.
You're arrogant,
and conceited, and...

375
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:23,136
I wrote you a letter
about it, in fact,
but I tore it up.

376
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,303
What did it say?

377
00:29:24,388 --> 00:29:26,389
None of your business.

378
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:29,308
I can't say I like your
seagulls much, either.

379
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:30,435
I come all
the way up here to...

380
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:32,019
But you were coming
up anyway, remember?

381
00:29:37,234 --> 00:29:38,568
Mitch?

382
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:41,737
I thought I saw your car.
What are you doing in town?

383
00:29:41,822 --> 00:29:43,239
I had to
acknowledge a delivery.

384
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:44,407
Of what?

385
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:47,577
Mother, I'd like you
to meet Melanie Daniels.
Miss Daniels, my mother.

386
00:29:47,661 --> 00:29:49,036
How do you do?

387
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:53,458
How do you do, Miss Daniels?
Acknowledge a what?

388
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:56,919
A delivery.
Miss Daniels brought us
some birds from San Francisco.

389
00:29:57,004 --> 00:29:59,589
For Cathy
for her birthday.
Where is she?

390
00:29:59,673 --> 00:30:01,174
Across at Brinkmeyer's.

391
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:03,551
As a matter of fact,
Miss Daniels is staying
up here for the weekend,

392
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:06,220
so I've already invited
her for dinner tonight.

393
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,310
Well,
you did go to the trouble
of bringing those birds.

394
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:14,020
MELANIE: Oh,
I couldn't possibly.

395
00:30:14,104 --> 00:30:15,730
You did say birds?

396
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:18,107
Yes, lovebirds.

397
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:20,193
Oh, I see.

398
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:25,781
MITCH: So we couldn't
let you get away

399
00:30:25,866 --> 00:30:27,325
without thanking you
in some small way.

400
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:29,619
And you haven't met
Cathy, and you are
staying the weekend.

401
00:30:29,703 --> 00:30:30,786
Well, yes, but...

402
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:32,121
Well, you are,
aren't you?

403
00:30:32,206 --> 00:30:33,331
Certainly, but...

404
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:34,457
MITCH: Then
it's all settled.

405
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:36,167
What time is
dinner, Mother?

406
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,668
7:00, the same as usual.

407
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:39,337
I'll pick you up.
Where are you staying?

408
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:40,713
With Annie, of course.

409
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:44,800
Oh, of course.
How stupid of me. 6:45?

410
00:30:44,885 --> 00:30:47,637
Annie may have
made other plans.
I'll have to see.

411
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:50,223
Besides,
I can find my own way.

412
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:52,099
You're sure now?
You won't hire
a boat or anything?

413
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:53,851
I'm sure.

414
00:30:53,936 --> 00:30:54,936
MITCH: 7:00, then.

415
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:56,771
Maybe.

416
00:30:57,814 --> 00:31:00,149
We'll be waiting for you.
How's your head?

417
00:31:00,234 --> 00:31:02,193
Much better, thank you.

418
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:05,363
A gull hit me,
Mrs. Brenner, that's all.

419
00:31:11,453 --> 00:31:12,745
(RINGING)

420
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,920
Oh, hi. Did you
find her all right?

421
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:22,547
Yes, I did.

422
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:24,882
I was wondering...

423
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:26,384
That sign there.

424
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:31,430
Do you suppose
I could have the room
for just a single night?

425
00:31:31,515 --> 00:31:33,391
I was planning
on renting it
for a longer time...

426
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:34,517
I would appreciate it.

427
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:36,644
I've tried
everywhere in town.
They're all full.

428
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:41,148
Well, all right.
Got your bags
in the car?

429
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:45,444
(CHUCKLES)
Well, it's utilitarian,
I'll say that.

430
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:48,447
I just picked up some
things for the night
at the general store.

431
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:50,324
You see, I hadn't planned
on staying very long.

432
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:55,454
Yes, I know.
Did something
unexpected come up?

433
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:00,376
Yes. May I use your phone?
I'd like to call home.

434
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:03,671
I just put some
coffee on the stove.

435
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:05,548
(SEAGULLS CAWING)

436
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,925
Don't they ever
stop migrating?

437
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:09,343
(CAWING)

438
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:52,553
(RINGS)

439
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:08,486
Hi!

440
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,821
Miss Daniels?

441
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:11,989
Yes.

442
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:15,493
Oh, they're beautiful!

443
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:18,537
They're just what I wanted.
Is there a man and a woman?

444
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:21,165
I can't tell
which is which.

445
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:22,583
MELANIE: Well,
I suppose so.

446
00:33:22,668 --> 00:33:24,168
MITCH: Hello there.
Annie had no plans, huh?

447
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:25,252
MELANIE: No.

448
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:27,213
Fine. We're very glad
you could come.
You hungry?

449
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:29,590
Reasonably.
Dinner's just
about ready.

450
00:33:29,675 --> 00:33:30,716
We've been out back
looking at the chickens.

451
00:33:30,801 --> 00:33:32,009
Something seems to
be wrong with them.

452
00:33:32,094 --> 00:33:34,011
There's nothing
wrong with those
chickens, Mitch.

453
00:33:34,096 --> 00:33:35,680
I'm going to call
Fred Brinkmeyer
right now.

454
00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:36,764
What good's
that gonna do?

455
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,766
The chickens won't eat.

456
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,185
He sold the feed
to me, didn't he?

457
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,312
Caveat emptor, Mother.
"Let the buyer beware."

458
00:33:43,397 --> 00:33:44,897
Whose side are you on?

459
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:46,524
Merely quoting
the law, dear.

460
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:48,275
Never mind the law.

461
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:59,662
This won't take long,
Miss... Hello, Fred?
Lydia Brenner.

462
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:01,539
I didn't interrupt
your dinner, did I?
How about a drink?

463
00:34:01,623 --> 00:34:02,665
Thank you,
I'd love one.

464
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:05,960
Fred, that feed
you sold me
is no good.

465
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,837
The chicken feed.

466
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:11,298
Well, it's just no good.
The chickens won't eat it.

467
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,634
They're always hungry.

468
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,136
I opened a sack for
them when I got home,

469
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,554
and they just
wouldn't touch it.

470
00:34:16,722 --> 00:34:18,889
You know chickens
as well as I do,
and when they won't eat,

471
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:22,226
there's something wrong
with what they're being fed.
That's all.

472
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,979
No, they're not
fussy chickens.

473
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:29,483
Who? What's he
got to do with it?

474
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:30,735
Is that your father?

475
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:32,319
Mmm-hmm.
Please sit down.

476
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:35,322
Fred, I don't care
how many sacks
of feed you sold him.

477
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:36,657
My chicken...

478
00:34:38,452 --> 00:34:40,327
Oh, I see.

479
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:43,414
Dan Fawcett.

480
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,124
This afternoon?

481
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:48,252
Well, that just proves
what I'm saying!
The feed you sold us...

482
00:34:50,464 --> 00:34:51,505
Oh.

483
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:57,261
Well, maybe I'd better
go over and see him.

484
00:34:57,345 --> 00:35:00,222
You don't think
there's something
going around, do you?

485
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:02,683
No, never!

486
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:07,354
No, Fred, they don't
seem sick at all.
They just won't eat.

487
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:09,523
Uh-huh.

488
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:15,362
Well, I'll try to
go over and see him.
Maybe he...

489
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:17,531
Uh-huh.

490
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:20,075
All right. Thanks.

491
00:35:23,997 --> 00:35:26,457
He had a call
from Dan Fawcett
a while ago.

492
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,459
His chickens
won't eat either.

493
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:31,962
It's what you said, Mom.
Mr. Brinkmeyer's feed
is no good.

494
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:35,716
No, Cathy.
He sold Mr. Fawcett
a different brand.

495
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:38,552
You don't think
they're getting sick,
do you, Mitch?

496
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:48,103
I still don't understand
how you knew
I wanted lovebirds.

497
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:49,980
Your brother told me.

498
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:53,901
Then you knew Mitch
in San Francisco?
Is that right?

499
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,986
No, not exactly.

500
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:58,989
Mitch knows
a lot of people
in San Francisco.

501
00:35:59,074 --> 00:36:00,908
Of course,
they're mostly hoods.

502
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:02,535
Cathy!

503
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:04,912
Well, Mom,
he's the first
to admit it.

504
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:08,666
He spends half his day
in the detention cells
at the Hall of Justice.

505
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:12,044
In a democracy, Cathy,
everyone is entitled
to a fair trial.

506
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:13,337
Your brother's practice...

507
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:14,880
Oh, Mom, please!

508
00:36:14,965 --> 00:36:18,175
I know all that
democracy jazz.
They're still hoods.

509
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:24,473
He has a client now
who shot his wife
in the head six times.

510
00:36:24,558 --> 00:36:27,643
Six times!
Can you imagine it?

511
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:31,772
I mean, even twice
would be overdoing it,
don't you think?

512
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:33,482
Why did he shoot her?

513
00:36:33,567 --> 00:36:35,359
He was watching
a ball game
on television.

514
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:36,569
What?

515
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:38,445
His wife changed
the channel.

516
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,533
Are you coming to
my party tomorrow?

517
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:43,868
I don't think so.

518
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:46,412
I have to get back
to San Francisco.

519
00:36:47,497 --> 00:36:48,497
Don't you like us?

520
00:36:48,582 --> 00:36:50,958
Oh, darling,
of course I do.

521
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,626
Don't you like
Bodega Bay?

522
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:53,878
I don't know yet.

523
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:57,464
Mitch likes it very much.
He comes up every weekend,
you know,

524
00:36:57,549 --> 00:37:00,467
even though he has
his own apartment
in the city.

525
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:03,888
He says San Francisco's
like an anthill at
the foot of a bridge.

526
00:37:03,972 --> 00:37:06,473
I suppose it does get
a little hectic at times.

527
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:10,853
Well, if you do decide
to come, don't say
I told you about it.

528
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:13,105
It's supposed to
be a surprise party.

529
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:16,317
You see, they've got this
whole complicated thing
figured out,

530
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:18,819
where I'm going
over to Michele's
for the afternoon,

531
00:37:18,904 --> 00:37:20,821
and Michele's mother
will say that
she has a headache.

532
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:22,990
Would I mind very much
if she took me home?

533
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:26,118
Then when I get home here,
all the kids will jump out!

534
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:32,124
Oh, won't you come?
Won't you please come?

535
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:36,921
I don't think so.

536
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:41,008
She's a charming girl,
isn't she, Mitch?

537
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,718
MITCH: Hmm? Yes.

538
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:43,928
Certainly pretty.

539
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:45,137
Mmm-hmm.

540
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:46,430
How long have
you known her?

541
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:49,266
Now, I told you, dear,
we met yesterday.

542
00:37:49,351 --> 00:37:51,518
In a bird shop.

543
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:53,520
She was selling birds?

544
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:57,816
No, no. I just led her into
believing that I believed
she was, and then...

545
00:37:57,901 --> 00:37:59,109
Well, it's all
very complicated.

546
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:00,527
But she did buy
the lovebirds,

547
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:02,196
and then drove all
the way out here.

548
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,781
Mother.
Yes?

549
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:05,616
Where did you
go to law school?

550
00:38:07,744 --> 00:38:09,244
Forgive me.

551
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:12,873
I suppose I'm just
naturally curious
about a girl like that.

552
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:14,792
She's very rich, isn't she?

553
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:16,126
Yeah, I suppose so.

554
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:18,462
Her father's part owner
of one of the big newspapers
in San Francisco.

555
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:21,674
You'd think he could manage
to keep her name out of print.

556
00:38:21,758 --> 00:38:23,842
She's always mentioned
in the columns, Mitch.

557
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:25,678
Yes, I know.

558
00:38:25,762 --> 00:38:29,264
She is the one who jumped
into a fountain in Rome
last summer, isn't she?

559
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:31,934
Yes.

560
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:34,228
I supposed
I'm old-fashioned.

561
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:37,314
I know it was supposed
to be very warm there,
but...

562
00:38:37,399 --> 00:38:39,900
Well, actually,
the newspapers said
she was naked.

563
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:41,860
Yes, I know, dear.

564
00:38:41,945 --> 00:38:43,362
Of course,
it's none of my business,

565
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:44,780
but when you bring
a girl like that...

566
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:46,031
Darling?

567
00:38:46,116 --> 00:38:47,116
Yes?

568
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,869
I think I can handle
Melanie Daniels by myself.

569
00:38:50,954 --> 00:38:54,915
Well, as long as you know
what you want, Mitch.

570
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,919
I know exactly
what I want.

571
00:39:04,217 --> 00:39:05,676
Be able to find your
way back all right?

572
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,636
Oh, yes.

573
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:11,015
Will I be
seeing you again?

574
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:13,225
San Francisco's
a long way from here.

575
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:14,852
I'm in San Francisco
five days a week

576
00:39:14,936 --> 00:39:15,978
with a lot of
time on my hands.

577
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:17,062
I'd like to see you.

578
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:19,606
Maybe we could go
swimming or something.

579
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:21,275
Mother tells me
you like to swim.

580
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:23,861
How does Mother know
what I like to do?

581
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:26,071
I guess we read
the same gossip column.

582
00:39:26,156 --> 00:39:28,532
Oh, that. Rome.

583
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,451
Yeah, I really like to swim.
I think we might
get along very well.

584
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:32,870
In case you're interested,
I was pushed
into that fountain.

585
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:34,204
Without any clothes on?

586
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:37,207
With all my clothes on.
The newspaper
that ran that story

587
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:38,917
happens to be a rival
of my father's paper.

588
00:39:39,002 --> 00:39:41,045
You were just a poor,
innocent victim
of circumstances?

589
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:42,880
I'm neither poor
nor innocent,

590
00:39:42,964 --> 00:39:44,048
but the truth of
that particular...

591
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:46,550
The truth is, you're running
around with a pretty
wild crowd, isn't it?

592
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:48,469
Yes, that's the truth,
but I was pushed
into that fountain,

593
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:49,720
and that's the truth, too.

594
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,055
Uh-huh.

595
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:53,182
Do you really
know Annie Hayworth?

596
00:39:53,266 --> 00:39:55,684
No. At least I didn't
until I came up here.

597
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,728
So you didn't go
to school together?
No.

598
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:59,271
And you didn't come
up here to see her?
No!

599
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:00,814
You were lying!
Yes, I was lying.

600
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,442
What about
the letter you wrote me?
Is that a lie, too?

601
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:04,568
No, I wrote the letter.

602
00:40:05,487 --> 00:40:06,570
Well, what did it say?

603
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:07,905
It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner.

604
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:10,074
"I think you need
these lovebirds after all.

605
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:11,658
"They may help
your personality."

606
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:13,827
That's what it said.
But you tore it up?

607
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:15,120
Yes.
Why?

608
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,040
Because it seemed
stupid and foolish.

609
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:19,500
Like jumping into
a fountain in Rome.

610
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:20,626
I told you what happened!

611
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:21,794
You don't expect me to
believe that, do you?

612
00:40:21,878 --> 00:40:23,921
Oh, I don't give a damn
what you believe!

613
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:26,465
I'd still like to see you.
Why?

614
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:28,050
I think it might be fun.

615
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:31,512
That might've been
good enough in Rome,
but it's not good enough now.

616
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:33,097
It is for me.
Well, not for me.

617
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:34,264
What do you want?

618
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:35,557
I thought you knew.

619
00:40:35,642 --> 00:40:40,104
I want to go through life
jumping into fountains naked.
Good night.

620
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:51,073
(BIRDS SQUAWKING)

621
00:40:51,825 --> 00:40:53,242
(CHIRPING)

622
00:41:01,251 --> 00:41:02,793
Miss Daniels,
is that you?

623
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:04,002
Yes.

624
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:05,295
Hi.

625
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:09,800
Is something wrong?
Is that cut beginning
to bother you?

626
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:12,177
No, it's not the cut
that's bothering me.

627
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,763
Would you like
some brandy?

628
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:17,516
If you have some,
I'd love it.

629
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,102
I'll get it.
Why don't you sit down,
Miss Daniels?

630
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:23,230
Oh, would you like a sweater
or something, a quilt?

631
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,566
No. No, thank you.

632
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:30,195
Won't you
call me Melanie?

633
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,488
All right.

634
00:41:39,873 --> 00:41:41,165
Thank you.

635
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:43,125
Gets a bit chilly here
at night sometimes,

636
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:45,460
especially if you're
over near the bay.

637
00:41:47,589 --> 00:41:49,756
Well, how did
your evening go?

638
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:53,594
Did you meet Lydia?

639
00:41:54,721 --> 00:41:56,597
Or would you rather
I changed the subject?

640
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:58,724
I think so.

641
00:42:00,602 --> 00:42:02,603
Well, how do you
like our little hamlet?

642
00:42:03,605 --> 00:42:05,189
I despise it.

643
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:06,523
(CHUCKLES)

644
00:42:06,608 --> 00:42:09,526
Well, I suppose
it doesn't offer much
to the casual visitor,

645
00:42:09,611 --> 00:42:12,613
unless you're thrilled
by a collection of shacks
on a hillside.

646
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:14,865
It takes a bit of
getting used to.

647
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:16,533
Where are you from
originally, Annie?

648
00:42:16,618 --> 00:42:17,868
San Francisco.

649
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:20,078
How did you happen
to come up here?

650
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:27,127
A friend invited me
up for a weekend
a long time ago.

651
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:31,048
Look, I see no reason
for being coy about this.

652
00:42:31,132 --> 00:42:33,133
It was Mitch Brenner.
I guess you knew that anyway.

653
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:34,801
I suspected as much.

654
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:38,055
Well, you needn't worry.

655
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:40,265
It's been over
and done with
a long time ago.

656
00:42:40,934 --> 00:42:43,644
Annie, there's nothing
between Mr. Brenner and me.

657
00:42:43,728 --> 00:42:45,187
Isn't there?

658
00:42:46,356 --> 00:42:47,898
Well, maybe
there isn't.

659
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:50,651
Maybe there's never
been anything between
Mitch and any girl.

660
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:53,570
What do you mean?

661
00:42:53,655 --> 00:42:56,740
I think I'll
have some of that.

662
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:59,576
I was seeing a lot of him
in San Francisco.

663
00:42:59,661 --> 00:43:01,912
Then one weekend,
he invited me
up to meet Lydia.

664
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:03,455
When was this?

665
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:07,251
Oh, four years ago,
shortly after
his father died.

666
00:43:07,877 --> 00:43:10,420
Of course, things
may be different now.

667
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:11,588
Different?

668
00:43:12,966 --> 00:43:14,383
With Lydia.

669
00:43:15,176 --> 00:43:17,219
Did she seem
a trifle distant?

670
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:18,512
A trifle.

671
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:21,848
Well, then perhaps things
aren't quite so different.

672
00:43:22,976 --> 00:43:25,435
You know, her attitude
nearly drove me crazy.

673
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,104
When I got back
to San Francisco,

674
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:29,898
I spent days trying to
figure out exactly what
I'd done to displease her.

675
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:31,692
Well, what had you done?

676
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,944
Nothing.

677
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:38,740
I simply existed.
So what's the answer?
A jealous woman, right?

678
00:43:38,825 --> 00:43:40,784
A clinging,
possessive mother?

679
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:42,244
Wrong.

680
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:43,704
With all due
respect to Oedipus,

681
00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:44,871
I don't think
that was the case.

682
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:46,581
Then what was it?

683
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:51,044
Lydia liked me.
That's the strange part.

684
00:43:51,796 --> 00:43:54,047
Now that I'm no
longer a threat,
we're very good friends.

685
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:56,049
Then why did
she object to you?

686
00:43:57,427 --> 00:43:58,552
Because she was afraid.

687
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:00,512
Afraid you'd take Mitch?

688
00:44:01,431 --> 00:44:02,931
Afraid I'd give Mitch.

689
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:04,766
I don't understand.

690
00:44:04,851 --> 00:44:06,310
Afraid of any woman
who would give Mitch

691
00:44:06,394 --> 00:44:09,104
the one thing
Lydia can give him, love.

692
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:11,732
That adds up
to a jealous,
possessive woman.

693
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:14,860
No, I don't think so.

694
00:44:14,944 --> 00:44:18,113
You see, she's not afraid
of losing Mitch.

695
00:44:18,865 --> 00:44:20,490
She's only afraid
of being abandoned.

696
00:44:20,575 --> 00:44:22,909
Someone ought to tell her
she'd be gaining a daughter.

(CHUCKLES)

698
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:27,998
No. She already
has a daughter.

699
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:31,793
Well, what about Mitch?
Didn't he have anything
to say about this?

700
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:35,756
Well, I can understand
his position.

701
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,425
He'd just been through
a lot with Lydia
after his father died.

702
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:40,385
He didn't want to risk
going through it all again.

703
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,054
Oh, I see.

704
00:44:42,138 --> 00:44:44,639
So it ended.
Not right then, of course.

705
00:44:44,724 --> 00:44:48,060
We went back to San Francisco,
saw each other now and then,

706
00:44:48,144 --> 00:44:49,644
but we both knew
it was over.

707
00:44:49,729 --> 00:44:51,772
Then what are you doing
here in Bodega Bay?

708
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:54,274
I wanted to
be near Mitch.

709
00:44:55,276 --> 00:44:57,944
Oh, it was over
and done with,
and I knew it, but...

710
00:44:58,029 --> 00:45:00,030
I still wanted
to be near him.

711
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,741
You see, I still like him
a hell of a lot,

712
00:45:04,202 --> 00:45:07,996
and I don't want to
lose that friendship, ever.

Sure. Hold on.

this is Melanie.

721
00:45:46,953 --> 00:45:49,037
Fine, thank you.

722
00:45:49,122 --> 00:45:52,833
No, no trouble at all.
I simply followed the road.

723
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:57,754
Well... there's no need
to apologize.

724
00:45:57,839 --> 00:45:59,464
I can understand.

725
00:46:01,342 --> 00:46:04,511
That's very kind of you.
No, I'm not angry.

00:46:08,057 --> 00:46:11,435
Well, I couldn't.
I have to get back
to San Francisco.

No, I wouldn't want
to disappoint Cathy, but...

00:46:21,237 --> 00:46:22,362
I see.

729
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:26,950
All right.
Yes, I'll be there.

730
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:29,119
Good night, Mitch.

731
00:46:32,373 --> 00:46:34,749
He wants me to go
to Cathy's party
tomorrow afternoon.

732
00:46:34,834 --> 00:46:36,042
I said I would.

733
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:38,170
It should be fun.

734
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,922
I'll be there,
too, to help.

735

so pointless.

I think I'll go to sleep.
It's been a busy day.

to Lydia, isn't it?

Never mind Lydia.
Do you want to go?

00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:17,209
Yes.

745
00:47:18,044 --> 00:47:19,085

want this coffee?

Hurry up with
yours, Mitch.

00:54:22,843 --> 00:54:25,553
I'm sure Miss Daniels
wants to be on her way.

00:54:25,638 --> 00:54:28,056
I think you ought to
stay the night, Melanie.

We have an extra

and everything.

a pretty bad

If I go across
to Santa Rosa,

860
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:37,440
I'll come out on
the freeway much
earlier, won't I?

861
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:39,442
Yes, and the freeway
is much quicker.

862
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:41,736
But she'll be hitting
all the heavy traffic
going back to San Francisco.

it is, Al.

Did you have a light
burning or something?

872
00:56:28,969 --> 00:56:30,219
Yes, but there
wouldn't have been

873
00:56:30,304 --> 00:56:32,013
that much light
going up the chimney.

invaded the house.

they got in the room

That's all.

I'll admit a bird will panic
in an enclosed room,

882
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:54,494

get in. They came in,
right down the chimney.

in the back seat
of her car once.

some seagulls came
down at the children!

889
00:57:07,007 --> 00:57:09,467
Miss Daniels was attacked
by a gull only yesterday.

bothering the birds
or something?

Those gulls attacked.

is a pretty strong word,
don't you think?

895
00:57:24,024 --> 00:57:26,317
I mean,
birds just don't go
around attacking people

896
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:28,277
without no reason.
You know what I mean?

897
00:57:28,362 --> 00:57:31,155
The kids probably
scared them, that's all.

898
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:33,032
These birds attacked.

understand you at all,

and I want so
much to understand.

01:06:07,547 --> 01:06:08,839
Why, Mrs. Brenner?

996
01:06:11,551 --> 01:06:15,387
Because my son seems
to be very fond of you,

997
01:06:15,472 --> 01:06:17,640
and I don't quite
know how I feel about it.

I don't even know
if I like you or not.

Is that so important,
your liking me?

Well, yes.
I think so.

1001
01:06:32,489 --> 01:06:35,032
Mitch is important to me.

1002
01:06:35,116 --> 01:06:37,701
I want to like
whatever girl he chooses.

1003
01:06:39,663 --> 01:06:41,038
And perhaps if you don't?

1004
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:46,960
Well, then I don't think
it'll matter very much
to anyone but me.

1005
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:49,630
Oh, I think it would
also matter to Mitch.

1006
01:06:51,216 --> 01:06:54,176
Mitch has always done
exactly what he wanted to do.

1007
01:06:59,057 --> 01:07:01,600
But, you see,

1008
01:07:03,103 --> 01:07:04,770
I don't want to be
left alone.

1009
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:07,690
I don't think I could
bear to be left alone!

1010
01:07:07,774 --> 01:07:12,778
Oh, forgive me.

1011
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:15,447
This business
with the birds
has upset me.

1012
01:07:15,532 --> 01:07:18,909
I don't know what I'd do
if Mitch weren't here.

1013
01:07:18,993 --> 01:07:22,246
Why don't you try
to sleep now,
Mrs. Brenner?

1014
01:07:23,331 --> 01:07:25,666

I was stronger.

1015
01:07:29,629 --> 01:07:31,380
Do you think
she's all right?

1016
01:07:31,464 --> 01:07:33,424
Do you think
she's all right
at the school?

1017
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:36,468
Would you like me
to go for her?

1018

01:18:10,353 --> 01:18:12,228
Two Bloody Marys, Deke.

1181
01:18:12,313 --> 01:18:13,730
What actually
happened at the school?

1182
01:18:13,814 --> 01:18:16,274
Bunch of crows
attacked the school kids.

1183
01:18:16,609 --> 01:18:20,111
It's the end of the world.
"Thus saith the Lord God

1184
01:18:20,196 --> 01:18:21,654
"unto the mountains
and the hills,

1185
01:18:21,739 --> 01:18:23,740
"and the rivers
and the valleys.

1186
01:18:23,824 --> 01:18:26,493
"Behold I, even I,

1187
01:18:26,577 --> 01:18:28,495
"shall bring
a sword upon you,

1188
01:18:28,579 --> 01:18:31,414
"and I will devastate
your high places."

1189
01:18:31,499 --> 01:18:33,416
Ezekiel, chapter six.

1190
01:18:33,501 --> 01:18:35,835
WAITRESS: "Woe unto them that
rise up early in the morning,

1191
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:37,462
"that they may
follow strong drink."

1192
01:18:37,546 --> 01:18:41,424
Isaiah, chapter five.
It's the end of the world.

1193
01:18:41,509 --> 01:18:45,470
I hardly think a few birds
are going to bring about
the end of the world.

1194
01:18:45,554 --> 01:18:47,263
These weren't
a few birds.

1195
01:18:47,348 --> 01:18:49,599
I didn't know
there were many crows
in Bodega Bay

1196
01:18:49,683 --> 01:18:50,767
this time of year.

1197
01:18:50,851 --> 01:18:54,396
The crow is
a permanent resident
throughout its range.

1198
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:57,899
In fact, during
our Christmas count,
we recorded...

1199
01:18:57,983 --> 01:19:00,235
How many gulls
did you count,
Mrs. Bundy?

1200
01:19:00,319 --> 01:19:03,488
MRS. BUNDY:
Which gulls, Mr. Sholes?
There are several varieties.

1201
01:19:03,572 --> 01:19:05,740
The ones who've
been playing devil
with my fishing boats.

1202
01:19:05,825 --> 01:19:07,117
Have you had
trouble with gulls?

1203
01:19:07,201 --> 01:19:08,743
One of my boats did,
last week.

1204
01:19:08,828 --> 01:19:11,579
This young lady
was hit by a gull
only Saturday.

1205
01:19:11,664 --> 01:19:13,748
Deke, I'm still waiting
for those Bloody Marys.

1206
01:19:13,833 --> 01:19:15,083
DEKE: Coming right up.

1207
01:19:15,167 --> 01:19:18,128
Could you ask them
to lower their voices,
please?

1208
01:19:18,212 --> 01:19:19,546
They're frightening
the children.

1209
01:19:19,630 --> 01:19:22,298
A whole flock of gulls
nearly capsized
one of my boats.

1210
01:19:22,383 --> 01:19:24,300
Practically tore
the skipper's arm off.

1211
01:19:24,385 --> 01:19:25,802
You're scaring the kids.
Keep it low.

1212
01:19:25,886 --> 01:19:26,970
All right.

1213
01:19:27,054 --> 01:19:29,889
Yeah, well,
he's scaring me, too.

1214
01:19:29,974 --> 01:19:32,392
Are you trying to
say that all these...

1215
01:19:34,395 --> 01:19:36,312
Nah, that sounds
impossible, Sebastian.

1216
01:19:36,397 --> 01:19:38,982
Deke, look, I'm just
telling you what happened
to one of my boats.

1217
01:19:39,066 --> 01:19:41,818
The gulls were after
your fish, Mr. Sholes.

1218
01:19:41,902 --> 01:19:44,279
Really, let's be
logical about this.

1219
01:19:44,363 --> 01:19:46,614
What were the crows
after at the school?

1220
01:19:48,576 --> 01:19:50,743
What do you think
they were after? Miss...

1221
01:19:50,870 --> 01:19:53,663
Daniels. I think
they were after
the children.

1222
01:19:53,747 --> 01:19:55,373
For what purpose?

1223
01:19:57,084 --> 01:19:58,084
To kill them.

1224
01:19:58,169 --> 01:19:59,461
Why?

1225
01:20:00,588 --> 01:20:02,338
I don't know why.

1226
01:20:02,423 --> 01:20:03,756
I thought not.

1227
01:20:03,841 --> 01:20:05,800
Birds have been
on this planet,
Miss Daniels,

1228
01:20:05,885 --> 01:20:09,596
since Archaeopteryx,
140 million years ago.

1229
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:12,724
Doesn't it seem odd that
they'd wait all that time

1230
01:20:12,808 --> 01:20:15,477
to start a war
against humanity?

1231
01:20:15,561 --> 01:20:16,811
No one called it a war.

1232
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:17,937
Scotch, light
on the water.

1233
01:20:18,022 --> 01:20:20,899
You and Mr. Sholes seem
to be implying as much.

1234
01:20:20,983 --> 01:20:23,735
Who said
anything about a war?
All I said, some gulls...

1235
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:25,737
WAITRESS: Want
some more coffee?
No.

1236
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:27,405
...came down on
one of my boats.

1237
01:20:27,490 --> 01:20:30,033
They could have
been after the fish,
just like you said.

1238
01:20:30,117 --> 01:20:32,911
The Captain should
have shot at them.
Huh?

1239
01:20:32,995 --> 01:20:36,498
Gulls are scavengers,
anyway. Most birds are.

1240
01:20:36,582 --> 01:20:39,125
Get yourselves guns
and wipe them off
the face of the Earth!

1241
01:20:40,252 --> 01:20:41,753
(CHUCKLES) That would
hardly be possible.

1242
01:20:41,837 --> 01:20:43,213
Why not,
Mrs. Bundy?

1243
01:20:43,964 --> 01:20:46,674
Because there
are 8,650 species

1244
01:20:46,759 --> 01:20:49,469
of birds in the world
today, Mr. Carter.

1245
01:20:49,553 --> 01:20:53,348
It is estimated that
5,750,000,000 birds

1246
01:20:53,432 --> 01:20:55,350
live in
the United States alone.

1247
01:20:55,434 --> 01:20:57,352
The five continents
of the world...

1248
01:20:57,436 --> 01:21:00,313
Kill them all.
Get rid of
the messy animals.

1249
01:21:00,397 --> 01:21:03,525
...probably contain
more than 100 billion birds.

1250
01:21:03,609 --> 01:21:05,318
It's the end of the world.

1251
01:21:05,402 --> 01:21:07,320
Those gulls must have
been after the fish.

1252
01:21:07,404 --> 01:21:08,571
MRS. BUNDY: Of course!

1253
01:21:08,656 --> 01:21:10,240
Hurry up, children.
Finish your lunch.

1254
01:21:10,324 --> 01:21:13,034
Are the birds
gonna eat us, Mommy?

1255
01:21:13,118 --> 01:21:15,870
Hell, maybe we're
all getting a little
carried away by this.

1256
01:21:15,955 --> 01:21:17,956
Admittedly,
a few birds
did act strange,

1257
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:19,290
but that's no reason
to believe that...

1258
01:21:19,375 --> 01:21:21,834
I keep telling you,
this isn't a few birds.

1259
01:21:21,919 --> 01:21:23,545
These are gulls,
crows, swifts...

1260
01:21:23,629 --> 01:21:26,839
I have never known birds
of different species
to flock together.

1261
01:21:26,924 --> 01:21:29,425
The very concept
is unimaginable.

1262
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:32,720
Why, if that happened,
we wouldn't have a chance!

1263
01:21:32,805 --> 01:21:35,056
How could we possibly
hope to fight them?

1264
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:36,474
We couldn't,
you're right.

1265
01:21:36,559 --> 01:21:38,226
You're right,
Mrs. Bundy.

1266
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:39,477
What's the matter?
Something wrong out here?

1267
01:21:39,562 --> 01:21:41,354
We're fighting
a war, Sam.

1268
01:21:42,189 --> 01:21:43,648
A war? Against who?

1269
01:21:43,732 --> 01:21:44,857
Against birds!

1270
01:21:44,942 --> 01:21:47,235
I'm glad you all think
this is so amusing.

1271
01:21:47,319 --> 01:21:48,987
You've frightened the children
half out of their wits.

1272
01:21:49,071 --> 01:21:50,196
If the young lady said

1273
01:21:50,281 --> 01:21:53,116
she saw
the attack at a school,
why don't you believe her?

1274
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:54,367
What attack?
Who attacked
the school?

1275
01:21:54,451 --> 01:21:56,119
WOMAN: Birds did. Crows.

1276
01:21:56,662 --> 01:21:58,538
You're all sitting
around here debating!

1277
01:21:58,622 --> 01:22:00,915
What do you want
them to do next?
Crash through that window?

1278
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,166
GIRL: Mommy!

1279
01:22:02,251 --> 01:22:03,960
Shh. Put on your coat.

1280
01:22:07,089 --> 01:22:10,383
Why don't you all go home,
lock your doors and windows?

1281
01:22:10,467 --> 01:22:12,135
What's the fastest
way to San Francisco?

1282
01:22:12,219 --> 01:22:13,261
The freeway, ma'am.

1283
01:22:13,345 --> 01:22:14,512
How do I find it?

1284
01:22:14,597 --> 01:22:17,015
I'm going out
that way, lady.
You can follow me.

1285
01:22:17,099 --> 01:22:19,017
WOMAN: Well, then
let's leave now.

1286
01:22:19,101 --> 01:22:21,019
Haven't finished
my drink yet.

1287
01:22:22,855 --> 01:22:24,772
I got here
as fast as I could.
Where's Cathy?

1288
01:22:24,857 --> 01:22:26,399
She's with Annie.
She's all right.

1289
01:22:26,483 --> 01:22:28,860
Al, why aren't you
over at the school,
where the attack was?

1290
01:22:28,944 --> 01:22:31,112
'Cause I just got back
from Dan Fawcett's place,
that's why.

1291
01:22:31,196 --> 01:22:32,864
He was killed
last night by birds.

1292
01:22:32,948 --> 01:22:34,157
What?

1293
01:22:34,241 --> 01:22:36,200
Now, hold it, Mitch.
You don't know that
for a fact.

1294
01:22:36,285 --> 01:22:38,369
What are the facts,
Mr. Malone?

1295
01:22:38,454 --> 01:22:40,830
The Santa Rosa Police
think it's a felony murder.

1296
01:22:40,914 --> 01:22:42,832
They think a burglar broke in,
killed him.

1297
01:22:42,916 --> 01:22:45,043
How do you explain
the dead birds
all over the floor?

1298
01:22:45,127 --> 01:22:48,379
Santa Rosa Police
figure they got in after
the old man was killed.

1299
01:22:48,464 --> 01:22:51,007
Were the Santa Rosa Police
at your school today?

1300
01:22:52,968 --> 01:22:54,218
Are you coming?

1301
01:22:54,303 --> 01:22:55,303
Now take it easy, lady.

1302
01:22:55,387 --> 01:22:57,972
There isn't a bird
anywhere in sight!

1303
01:22:58,057 --> 01:23:01,809
"Look at the birds of the air.
They do not sow or reap.

1304
01:23:01,894 --> 01:23:05,563
"Yet your heavenly Father
feeds them."

1305
01:23:05,648 --> 01:23:08,441
Say, something
like this happened
in Santa Cruz last year.

1306
01:23:08,525 --> 01:23:11,235
The town was just
covered with seagulls.

1307
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:12,820
Will you please
finish your drink?

1308
01:23:12,905 --> 01:23:14,864
That's right, sir.
I recall it.

1309
01:23:14,948 --> 01:23:17,450
A large flock of seagulls
got lost in a fog,

1310
01:23:17,534 --> 01:23:20,161
and headed into the town
where all the lights were.

1311
01:23:20,245 --> 01:23:23,456
They made some mess, too,
smashing into buildings
and everything.

1312
01:23:23,540 --> 01:23:24,791
They always make a mess.

1313
01:23:24,875 --> 01:23:28,002
The point is
that no one seemed
to be upset about it.

1314
01:23:28,087 --> 01:23:29,587
They were all
gone next morning,

1315
01:23:29,672 --> 01:23:31,506
just as though
nothing at all
had happened.

1316
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:32,590
Poor things.

1317
01:23:32,675 --> 01:23:34,842
I'm leaving!
Are you coming?

1318
01:23:34,927 --> 01:23:36,844
All right,
all right!

1319
01:23:39,223 --> 01:23:41,516
Well, hope you folks
figure this thing out!

1320
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:43,309
It's the end
of the world!

1321
01:23:44,561 --> 01:23:47,271
I better get back
to the cannery.
What do I owe you, Deke?

1322
01:23:47,356 --> 01:23:49,065
Sebastian,
hold it a minute.

1323
01:23:49,149 --> 01:23:50,525
I don't want to be
an alarmist about this...

1324
01:23:50,609 --> 01:23:52,026
No one ever said
you were, Mitch.

1325
01:23:52,111 --> 01:23:53,236
I think we're
in real trouble.

1326
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:54,487
I don't know how
this started, or why,

1327
01:23:54,571 --> 01:23:56,781
but I know it's here
and we'd be crazy
to ignore it.

1328
01:23:56,865 --> 01:23:58,700
To ignore what?
The "bird war"?

1329
01:23:58,784 --> 01:23:59,826
Yes, the "bird war."

1330
01:23:59,910 --> 01:24:01,828
The bird attack, plague...
Call it what you like,

1331
01:24:01,912 --> 01:24:03,204
they're massing
out there someplace,

1332
01:24:03,288 --> 01:24:04,706
and they'll be back.
You can count on it.

1333
01:24:04,790 --> 01:24:05,748
Ridiculous.

1334
01:24:05,833 --> 01:24:07,041
Come here.

1335
01:24:07,126 --> 01:24:08,543
Unless we do
something right now,

1336
01:24:08,627 --> 01:24:10,211
unless we get Bodega Bay
on the move, they...

1337
01:24:10,295 --> 01:24:12,255
Look, Mitch.

1338
01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:16,592
Even if this is true,
even if all the birds...

1339
01:24:16,677 --> 01:24:18,219
Don't you believe
it's true?

1340
01:24:18,303 --> 01:24:20,471
No, Mitch,

and antiseptic. Quickly!

1513
01:50:07,810 --> 01:50:10,103
Bandages. It's terrible.

1514
01:50:14,108 --> 01:50:16,067
Cathy, get some brandy.

1515
01:50:27,538 --> 01:50:30,164
No, no, no!
No, no, it's all right.

1516
01:50:30,249 --> 01:50:32,166
No, it's all right,
it's all right,
it's all right.

(SIGHS) We've got to
get her to a hospital.

1521
01:51:22,384 --> 01:51:24,052
We can't, Mitch.
There's no place
we can go.

1522
01:51:24,136 --> 01:51:25,136
There's San Francisco.

1523
01:51:25,262 --> 01:51:26,220
We'd never make it.

1524
01:51:26,305 --> 01:51:27,597
We have to try.

1525
01:51:27,681 --> 01:51:29,182
We'll go by way
of Bay Hill Road.

1526
01:51:29,266 --> 01:51:30,767
Then we don't have
to go through town.

1527
01:51:30,851 --> 01:51:32,769
We can't stay here.
She needs help!

1528
01:51:33,437 --> 01:51:35,688
I'm frightened.
Terribly frightened.

1529
01:51:37,649 --> 01:51:39,400
I don't know
what's outside there.

1530
01:51:40,778 --> 01:51:43,863
We better get started
before another attack comes.

1531
01:51:43,947 --> 01:51:46,699
We'll take Melanie's car.
That'll be faster
than the truck.

1532
01:51:46,784 --> 01:51:48,159
Can you finish
the bandaging?

1533
01:51:48,243 --> 01:51:49,369
I'll try.

1534
01:51:49,453 --> 01:51:50,787
All right.

1535
01:51:57,544 --> 01:52:02,131

See if you can get anything
on the car radio.

ANNOUNCER:
The bird attacks have subsided
for the time being.

1542
01:54:03,962 --> 01:54:05,338
Bodega Bay seems
to be the center,

1543
01:54:05,422 --> 01:54:07,048
though there are
reports of minor attacks

1544
01:54:07,132 --> 01:54:10,176
on Sebastopol and
a few on Santa Rosa.

1545
01:54:10,260 --> 01:54:12,762
Bodega Bay has been
cordoned off by roadblocks.

1546
01:54:12,846 --> 01:54:14,805
Most of the townspeople
have managed to get out,

1547
01:54:14,890 --> 01:54:17,517
but there are still
some isolated
pockets of people.

1548
01:54:17,601 --> 01:54:21,187
No decision has been
arrived at yet as to
what the next step will be,

1549
01:54:21,271 --> 01:54:24,440
but there's been
some discussion as to whether
the military should go in.

1550
01:54:24,525 --> 01:54:26,359
It appears
that the bird attacks
come in waves,

1551
01:54:26,443 --> 01:54:28,194
with long intervals between.

1552
01:54:28,278 --> 01:54:31,322
The reason for this
does not seem clear as yet.

Shh.

Stay there.

1566
01:57:49,730 --> 01:57:52,064
Can I bring the
lovebirds, Mitch?

1567
01:57:52,149 --> 01:57:54,400
They haven't
harmed anyone.

1568
