00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:30,990
THE EXTERMINATING ANGEL

4
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:35,020
PROVIDENCE STREET

5
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:56,618
- Where are you going?
- For a quick walk.

6
00:01:56,783 --> 00:02:00,583
We have 20 guests arriving.
How could you go now?

7
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:03,374
I didn't think of that.
Maybe you're right.

8
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,505
I'll be back as soon as I can.

9
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:06,756
You're not leaving.

10
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:09,137
Please, let me go.

11
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,306
Fine, then. Go.

12
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,679
But never set foot
in this house again.

13
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,002
Lucas just left.

14
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:44,207
What got into him?
Did he quarrel with one of you?

15
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:48,089
Not with us.
He didn't even mention he was leaving.

16
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,092
We got along just fine.

17
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,847
He's a good fellow.

18
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,600
Well, if he didn't like it here,
good riddance.

19
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:58,054
There's plenty of others
like him around.

20
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:00,768
Probably chasing some skirt.
You never know.

21
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,196
- Camila?
- What?

22
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:19,249
- What are we gonna do?
- Whatever you want.

23
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:22,544
But make it soon.
I can't wait to get out of here.

24
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,496
Same here.

25
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:28,425
But where can we go at this hour?

26
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,003
Yes, it's late,
and it's a nasty night out.

27
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,306
A friend would let us stay at her place.

28
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:39,345
I can drop you somewhere.
I'm going quite a ways out by cab.

29
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:41,647
You're staying and waiting for me.

30
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:55,868
Haven't you set out the caviar?

31
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:57,700
No, that comes later.

32
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:00,373
Madam wants the main course
served first.

33
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,997
And she asked me to do it.

34
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,919
'Cause you're such a clown.

35
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,471
That's odd. Lucas isn't here.

36
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,884
They'll take our coats upstairs.
Please go on up.

37
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,195
Hear anything?

38
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:14,277
They must be upstairs by now.

39
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:17,947
Taking off like this
really isn't right.

40
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:21,535
You should have thought of that before.
Stay if you like.

41
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:23,407
Let's go.

42
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,347
That's odd. Lucas isn't here.

43
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,273
They'll take our coats upstairs.

44
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,609
Please go on up.

45
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,526
<i>No, I've never tried it.</i>

46
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:42,115
So the youngest colonel in the army
claims to be neither honorable nor heroic.

47
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:45,743
Blanca, I can't stand
the roar of cannons.

48
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:47,499
What about the fatherland?

49
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:51,708
The fatherland is a string of rivers
that flow into the sea.

50
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,038
Which is death.

51
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:55,340
Yes. Death for the fatherland.

52
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,043
Alvaro, Edmundo
has something to say.

53
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:02,928
To the delightful evening
our friend Silvia provided us,

54
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:06,976
and to her wonderful creation
of the “Virgin Bride of Lammermoor.”

55
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:17,029
“Bride” I can accept.
But virgin?

56
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:21,067
The virgin part would have suited
the Valkyrie better.

57
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,275
The Valkyrie?

58
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:24,657
Yes, Leticia.

59
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,571
I call her that because she's ferocious

60
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:27,952
and a virgin.

61
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,287
A virgin? You think so?

62
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,499
They say she's holding on
to that object.

63
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,876
Perhaps it's some kind of perversion.

64
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:41,469
To the delightful evening
our friend Silvia provided us,

65
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:45,431
and to her wonderful creation
of the “Virgin Bride of Lammermoor.”

66
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:05,281
Forgive me if I change
the usual order of the menu.

67
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,320
We'll start with a Maltese dish

68
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:09,827
traditionally served on the island
as an hors d'oeuvre.

69
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,453
It stimulates the appetite.

70
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:14,753
Liver, honey and almonds
in a very spicy sauce.

71
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,080
It's delicious.

72
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:19,504
I had it in Capri, where I conducted
a concert years ago.

73
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,719
Just like in the theater - right on cue.

74
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:39,315
Delicious, Lucia.

75
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:41,237
And quite unexpected.

76
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,861
Lucia has a style all her own.

77
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:51,448
Not everyone can pull off
a surprise like that.

78
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:54,042
I didn't find it funny in the least.

79
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:24,781
I caught you in time.
Don't let him out, Julio.

80
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,943
Mr. Russel doesn't like jokes.

81
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:29,653
Take him back out to the garden.

82
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,867
I'm relieved to hear that.

83
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:34,574
There are serious matters
that require your urgent attention.

84
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:37,080
- Is something wrong?
- Strange things are going on.

85
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,083
If madam would accompany me.

86
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:42,416
What about the sheep?
- To the garden as well.

87
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,178
Where are you going?

88
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:57,014
What's the meaning of this?
Are you leaving?

89
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:01,310
Yes, ma'am. I have to see my sister.
Poor girl just -

90
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:04,236
Enough! ls she sick or what?

91
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,906
She didn't feel well this morning and -

92
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,654
This is madness! An outrage!

93
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:12,071
How can you leave
just as my guests sit down to dinner?

94
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:15,665
Forgive us, madam,
but everything is ready to serve.

95
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:17,951
God grant me patience.

96
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,745
Are you unhappy here?

97
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:21,834
On the contrary, ma'am.

98
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:25,258
I have only fond memories
of five years in your service.

99
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,676
Well then?

100
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:28,716
Please forgive me.

101
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,843
And where are you going?

102
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:33,766
With Pablo to see his sister,

103
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:36,265
but we'll both be back
first thing in the morning.

104
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:39,564
Don't bother.
Leave now and you're fired.

105
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:43,063
I'd give anything
to make madam happy.

106
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:46,401
Please forgive us.

107
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,659
They planned this together.
But why?

108
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:56,535
Domestic help grows
more impertinent by the day, madam.

109
00:10:56,739 --> 00:11:00,539
I trust you and the two waiters
will manage to serve.

110
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,178
We should take our things.

111
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:17,386
No, we're in a hurry.
We'll come for them tomorrow.

112
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,516
They won't let us set foot
in the house tomorrow.

113
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:22,440
I'll just take a moment to pack.
Wait for me outside.

114
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:42,122
Some Jew passing by.

115
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:45,251
No, it was the Valkyrie.

116
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,509
What an interesting woman.

117
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:56,132
What's your name?

118
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,301
Beatriz. And yours?

119
00:11:58,468 --> 00:11:59,469
Eduardo.

120
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:01,604
- Age?
- Thirty.

121
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:07,526
Profession?

122
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,153
Architect.

123
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,358
Single?

124
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,618
Until Saturday... just like yourself.

125
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,289
Just five more days.

126
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:22,541
I feel wonderful tonight, Doctor.

127
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:24,460
I ate with real relish.

128
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:26,997
Your treatment has worked wonders.

129
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:30,842
I deserve no credit.
Your ailment was really quite minor.

130
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:34,675
- Do you dance, Doctor?
- I've never tried.

131
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:38,307
What a shame.
I hoped you'd take me in your arms.

132
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:41,728
I'm flattered my patient
feels so amiably toward me, but-

133
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:49,311
Transference.

134
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:52,356
I've longed to satisfy that desire
for some time now.

135
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,532
Did you bring your pills?

136
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:55,991
What's wrong?

137
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:57,819
Oh, it's nothing, Doctor.

138
00:12:57,986 --> 00:12:59,078
I told you.

139
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:01,872
You mustn't eat so much, Cristian.
An ulcer is unforgiving.

140
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:07,588
Cristian, permit me to introduce
my good friend, newly arrived in our city.

141
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,706
Leandro Gómez, Cristian Ugalde.

142
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,541
- Pleased to meet you.
- Likewise.

143
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,793
Will you excuse me?
- Of course.

144
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:16,929
Aren't you going in to hear Blanca?

145
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:19,011
In just a moment, Cono.

146
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:20,676
What was that about?

147
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:23,186
Why that passionate kiss?

148
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,688
Poor Leonora.

149
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:28,896
Is there any hope for her cancer?

150
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,651
Unfortunately, none.

151
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:34,072
In three months
she'll be completely bald.

152
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:36,066
She's got a nice head.

153
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,623
- Leandro!
- My dear friend Cristian.

154
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,205
I'm so happy to see you!

155
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:52,382
I thought you two were in New York,
as always.

156
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:55,836
Well, here we are.
You'll have to make the best of it.

157
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,928
We'll have to see a lot of each other.

158
00:13:58,004 --> 00:13:59,176
Absolutely.

159
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:02,509
In fact, come by tomorrow.
I have a little box to give you.

160
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:04,435
Careful. We're not alone.

161
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:07,268
Allow me to introduce you
to Mr. Sergio Russel.

162
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:11,276
Don't bother.
You two continue catching up.

163
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,690
I've got no stomach for mumbo jumbo.

164
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,317
Excuse me.

165
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:20,527
- That Russell is an eccentric.
- A tough cookie. But that's his problem.

166
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:23,284
Let's go and listen to Blanca.

167
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,754
Very nice!

168
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,257
Magnificent, as always.

169
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,009
A delightful performance.

170
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:22,138
Pity there was no harpsichord.
It would have sounded wonderful.

171
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:25,175
Please play some Scarlatti for us.

172
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:28,515
You'll have to forgive me.
lt's late and I'm tired.

173
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:29,850
Late?

174
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:33,312
This is the most intimate and pleasant
hour of the whole evening.

175
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,685
That was marvelous, Blanca.

176
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,611
That was by Paradisi, wasn't it?

177
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:39,189
That was exquisite.

178
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:43,693
Who'd have guessed the world-renowned
orchestral conductor was -

179
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:49,374
I'm very pleased to meet you
under such fraternal circumstances.

180
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:52,077
- What lodge?
- Dawn 21.

181
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,662
Sublime column. Grade.

182
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:58,459
Maestro, I'd love to hear your opinion
of the “pizzicato” we just heard.

183
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:01,044
It was a sonata, sir.

184
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:04,172
Allow me to introduce Mr. Ugalde.

185
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:06,136
And your name is?

186
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,717
Leandro Gómez.
Pleased to meet you.

187
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,849
- Do you plan to stay long in the city?
- Do you?

188
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,771
- You tell me first.
- No, you.

189
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,432
I live here.

190
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:16,017
I expected as much.

191
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,819
- Get the coats ready.
- Yes, sir.

192
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:35,832
Forgive him.

193
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,293
He felt rejuvenated tonight.

194
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:41,717
He hasn't had wine in a while.
Between that and the fatigue...

195
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:44,095
Alberto's stamina is admirable.

196
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,926
You only have to watch him conduct.

197
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,725
How can he endure hours
of such tension and activity?

198
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,521
When we retire to bed
after a concert,

199
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:55,519
he still tries -

200
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,858
I have no complaints
in that department.

201
00:16:57,934 --> 00:17:00,153
On the contrary,
I have to hold him off.

202
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:03,944
Let him rest, then.
We wouldn't want him to try -

203
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,029
Heavens no, Edmundo!

204
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:08,528
I'm sure he wouldn't dare here.

205
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:11,160
No, of course not.

206
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:13,037
I didn't express myself well.

207
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:17,454
She's just a bit tired.
In her condition, it's natural.

208
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:20,715
Rita's sleepiness is a good sign.
Congratulations.

209
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,508
This is the fourth, isn't it?

210
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,927
Actually, I've lost track, ma'am.

211
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,801
Are you sure of the father?
I mean -

212
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,632
You should ask her.

213
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,801
Science will tell.

214
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:38,808
Blanca, I thought you'd already left.

215
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:40,898
I was delayed for a moment.

216
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:42,979
Raul was telling us
that the fauna in Romania -

217
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,863
Due to the climate extremes.

218
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:47,738
But enough talk for now.
I must be leaving.

219
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,451
Where could my shawl be?

220
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:51,154
Just a moment.

221
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:14,677
Why don't they leave?

222
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:16,978
It's almost 4:00.

223
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,601
Any minute now.

224
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:22,564
You can sneak off to my bedroom
during all the good-byes.

225
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,562
What about Edmundo?

226
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:28,399
If he comes in, I'll say
I was showing you the incunabula.

227
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,947
Good idea.

228
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:44,874
Thank you.

229
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:54,304
Everything was perfect, Lucia,
despite -

230
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:57,895
At this hour,
even lipstick begins to fade.

231
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:02,521
The problem now
is how to take care of our friends.

232
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:04,727
They must be uncomfortable.

233
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:14,324
I love the spontaneity of this situation.

234
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,697
If you'd like to spend the night,

235
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:19,910
we'll make up
as many rooms as needed.

236
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:24,922
I'm pleased to see the old spirit
of improvisation is alive and well.

237
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,625
You're the perfect host, Edmundo.

238
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:31,053
But I wouldn't wish
to impose on your kind hospitality.

239
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,844
I'm afraid I have a rehearsal
tomorrow afternoon.

240
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:37,769
And I have an appointment
just four hours from now, so -

241
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,952
This is getting serious.
They're turning out the lights.

242
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:57,284
The moment has come to decide.

243
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,157
We should leave right now.

244
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:02,452
If the others are drunk or crazy,
let them stay.

245
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:06,122
This is outrageous.

246
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:11,716
If it weren't for the respect due our hosts,
I'd like to teach that boor a lesson!

247
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:16,258
These stiff clothes
are for statues, not men.

248
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,308
Especially at 5:00 in the morning.

249
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:30,567
Aren't they going a bit far,
taking off their tuxedo jackets?

250
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:34,234
Don't forget Leandro lives
in the United States.

251
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:38,238
Besides, this is the time
when the body's most relaxed,

252
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,661
and with the pleasant
temperature in here -

253
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:44,669
I'm sure they'll feel ashamed
when they look back on their behavior.

254
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:46,996
I'm sure they will.

255
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:49,712
And I'd like to spare them
that embarrassment.

256
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:53,386
Let's meet them on their level

257
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:56,135
to make their Faux pas less obvious.

258
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:57,738
Please, Lucia, take my spot.

259
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,927
Our first night together.

260
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,725
What are we doing here?

261
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:26,433
Why didn't we leave?

262
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:31,483
Everyone decided to stay.

263
00:22:36,564 --> 00:22:38,362
Does that seem normal to you?

264
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:40,609
Life is amusing...

265
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:42,949
and strange.

266
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,911
I can't stand up another minute.

267
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:52,963
Come.

268
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,291
Let's go to sleep.

269
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:32,809
Good morning, Rita.
Did you sleep well?

270
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:35,687
I didn't wake up even once.

271
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:37,734
I was just the opposite.
What a night!

272
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:42,031
I haven't been in such torment since
the train to Nice went off the tracks.

273
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:44,450
You've gone off the tracks before?

274
00:24:44,525 --> 00:24:45,651
How interesting!

275
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:48,203
You should see yourself in a mirror.

276
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,747
I'm confused.

277
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,583
What's going on here?

278
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:56,787
I don't know
how we got to this point,

279
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,831
but there's a limit to everything.

280
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:02,298
What can I say? For now
we have to offer them breakfast.

281
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:04,678
I'm sure they'll go home after that.

282
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,513
Of course.

283
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:08,678
I trust in their discretion.

284
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:11,560
I ran all over the place,
out of my mind.

285
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:16,561
A third-class car full of village folk
was squashed like an accordion.

286
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:19,102
What a slaughterhouse it was inside!

287
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:23,155
I must be unfeeling. The misery
of those wretches didn't move me.

288
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:24,486
I'm hungry-

289
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:28,744
Unfeeling? You fainted on viewing
the body of Prince Lurca in state.

290
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:30,996
You mustn't compare the two.

291
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:34,079
How could anyone be indifferent
before the majesty

292
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:36,957
of that admirable prince, our friend.

293
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:39,417
That noble profile!

294
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,461
Don't they eat breakfast here?

295
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:46,467
I think the lower classes
are less sensitive to pain.

296
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:49,177
Have you ever seen a wounded bull?

297
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:50,508
Not a trace of emotion.

298
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:53,431
I'm going to freshen up a bit.

299
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:56,013
We all look a fright.

300
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,932
This is so much fun.

301
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,733
Did you sleep well?

302
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:06,824
Why do you look at me like that, sister?
I must look awful.

303
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:09,610
You look more interesting than ever.

304
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,991
The disheveled look suits you.

305
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:29,555
Why do you look at me like that?
I must look awful.

306
00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:32,095
You're more interesting than ever.

307
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:34,472
The disheveled look suits you.

308
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:36,474
What a set of ears.

309
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:51,284
It happened during the night.

310
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,364
He lost consciousness at dawn
but then came to a bit.

311
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:58,417
Why didn't you alert us immediately?
We must put him to bed upstairs.

312
00:26:58,492 --> 00:27:00,460
Best not to move him right now.

313
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:03,793
We'll see what we can do.
Keep him covered up.

314
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:06,421
He looked a bit strange during dinner.

315
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,720
It may be nothing.
He's had a few of these incidents.

316
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:12,006
What do you think, Doctor?

317
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:14,971
Within a few hours
he'll be completely bald.

318
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,848
I don't understand.

319
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,809
I mean he has just a few hours to live.

320
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:23,313
That's awful.
Your predictions are never off.

321
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:26,444
I don't feel very well either.

322
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:28,321
Nonsense.

323
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:39,621
Do what you can to set out
a nice breakfast for our guests.

324
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:43,079
But, ma'am, it's so early.
The groceries haven't even arrived.

325
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:46,169
- Not even the milkman?
- No, and that's strange indeed.

326
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:49,878
Bring out the meat left over from dinner
and some hot coffee.

327
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,179
Lucia, dear,
where could we freshen up a bit?

328
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:03,519
I'm sorry I didn't see to that earlier.

329
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:05,442
Shall we go to my dressing room?

330
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:13,825
I bet they don't leave this room.

331
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:17,329
You see?

332
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:19,531
What do you make of this?

333
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:20,790
I honestly don't know.

334
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:23,998
It seems unreal...
or perhaps too normal.

335
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:27,832
I find it odd
no one but us is concerned.

336
00:28:28,582 --> 00:28:31,131
Why didn't you and your Fiancée
leave last night?

337
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:34,175
I don't know.
Like everyone else.

338
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:35,801
What about you?

339
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,638
I don't know.

340
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:43,226
And that's what worries me.

341
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,107
After last night's party,

342
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:49,653
none of us made
the slightest effort to go home.

343
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:52,397
Why?

344
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:55,735
Was it normal for us to spend
the night in this room,

345
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:58,829
violating the most basic precepts
of good etiquette?

346
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,374
We turned this room
into a gypsy campground.

347
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:06,332
I find it very original.
I love when things deviate from the routine.

348
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:09,335
I saw what was happening,
and I didn't like it.

349
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:11,876
I kept quiet out of courtesy.

350
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:15,884
Come now, gentlemen.
No need to blow things out of proportion.

351
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:18,678
We were all under the spell

352
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:22,519
of the music, the friendly
conversation, the good cheer.

353
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:24,146
Nothing to be surprised at.

354
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:26,227
My feet have swollen.

355
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:31,362
For example, dear Lucia,

356
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,273
why did you have the butler
serve us breakfast here

357
00:29:34,356 --> 00:29:36,279
and not in the dining room?

358
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:37,822
I don't know, Doctor.

359
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:40,654
I thought since
we're already gathered in here -

360
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:43,873
lt's clear the doctor likes
to play Sherlock Holmes.

361
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,952
Don't you think?

362
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,627
I have to get home.

363
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:51,794
My husband and children
must be worried. I'm leaving.

364
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:54,422
We'll go with you. I should say!

365
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:57,345
This is absurd! Let's go.

366
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:06,354
- Are you coming, Rita?
- No, not yet.

367
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,478
What would we do out at this hour?

368
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:12,107
For God's sake, you have children
in school just like me.

369
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:15,064
My children have a tutor at home:
Deacon Sampson.

370
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:17,445
A very cultured man
of great refinement.

371
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:21,578
Forgive me if I exaggerate,
but I think he may well be a saint,

372
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:24,616
though Cristian thinks -
Right, Cristian?

373
00:30:24,698 --> 00:30:28,794
This is no time for talk of deacons.
What do we care about your -

374
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:30,754
Let's go.

375
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:33,791
Excuse me.

376
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,423
You know,
a cup of coffee wouldn't hurt.

377
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:43,767
I can't have my cigarette
on an empty stomach.

378
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,719
I'd like some too.

379
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:47,937
Will you join us, Blanca?

380
00:30:55,145 --> 00:30:59,696
I think they're being hysterical,
getting so alarmed over this.

381
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:03,905
It's not the first time the morning's
found me at a party like this.

382
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:12,253
Excuse me, Lucia,
but there are no spoons for the sugar.

383
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:15,382
Forgive me.
Poor Julio has his hands full.

384
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,634
Julio, bring some small spoons.

385
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:29,556
Wouldn't you gentlemen like
some coffee or cold cuts?

386
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:31,436
Nothing, Julio.

387
00:31:31,515 --> 00:31:33,563
Go do as you were told.

388
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:38,026
I think I'd better wait
to clear the dishes first.

389
00:31:38,105 --> 00:31:41,359
Didn't you hear me?
I asked you to bring spoons.

390
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:45,575
- I took the liberty of asking -
- Enough. Do as I tell you.

391
00:31:55,122 --> 00:31:58,046
What's wrong?
Don't you feel well?

392
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:07,934
Blanca, what's wrong?
Can I help you?

393
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:15,350
What do you think
about what just happened?

394
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:19,856
The butler's strange resistance
to carrying out his orders

395
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:22,574
confirms my observations.

396
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:26,453
Since last night, not one of us,
try as we might,

397
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:29,164
has been able to leave this room.

398
00:32:29,573 --> 00:32:32,167
What's going on here,
Aranda, my friend?

399
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:20,461
There's a very sick man.

400
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:38,188
How is he, Doctor?

401
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:41,695
No use hiding the truth.
He's slipping into a coma.

402
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:45,612
If I only had some Coramine
or oil of camphor.

403
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:51,204
Cristian, out of simple humanity,

404
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:55,163
you must make an effort
to shatter this lethargy.

405
00:33:55,242 --> 00:34:00,464
We must get Russel to where
he can receive appropriate care.

406
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:06,678
Dr. Conde is right.
We have to make an effort.

407
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:08,964
Which of you will try?

408
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:13,302
Why don't you try yourselves?
<i>We'll</i> be right behind you.

409
00:34:13,677 --> 00:34:15,270
It's no use.

410
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,644
We're doomed!

411
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:22,276
Sister, why did you bring me here?

412
00:34:22,936 --> 00:34:26,861
Don't be cruel.
It was you who made me come.

413
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:29,151
Calm down.

414
00:34:54,676 --> 00:34:56,269
There's no more water.

415
00:34:57,512 --> 00:35:00,391
A little coffee?

416
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:02,104
I'm dying of thirst.

417
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:06,022
Forgive me, but there's not
a single drop left.

418
00:35:06,396 --> 00:35:09,024
This water smells a bit,
but it can't be bad.

419
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:12,035
Some lemon will take away
the bad taste.

420
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,863
No, thank you, Eduardo.
I prefer to wait.

421
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:18,955
I just don't get it.

422
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,749
There's got to be a solution.

423
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:25,415
We haven't all gone crazy, have we?

424
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:28,297
We've been here 24 hours,
yet no one's come for us.

425
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:30,094
They've forgotten about us.

426
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:33,970
The attitude of those outside
concerns me more than our situation.

427
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:36,723
What's going on with them?
They should have tried -

428
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:40,726
Unless they've all died
and we're the only survivors.

429
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,523
Why don't they come for us?

430
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:46,020
Calm down.
Don't lose your head.

431
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:48,981
Come now, gentlemen.

432
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:52,694
- Was I talking to you?
- Let's not get hysterical!

433
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:54,323
Shut up!

434
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:57,201
- I'll break a window.
- Don't bother. The door's right there.

435
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,784
This has something to do with the servants
running off. Why did they leave?

436
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:03,245
Gentlemen, I beg of you.

437
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:05,422
There's no need
for alarming hypotheses.

438
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:08,171
I'm sure the servants
had their reasons for leaving.

439
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:13,256
Yes, the same reasons
rats flee a sinking ship.

440
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,298
If you'll allow me,

441
00:36:15,382 --> 00:36:18,181
they didn't even seem to know
why they were leaving.

442
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:21,638
An hour before everyone arrived,
they were fine.

443
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:25,191
So there's no explication for anything.
This is just great!

444
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:27,610
The most important thing
is to keep our heads.

445
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:29,609
There's nothing worse than panic.

446
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:33,113
This situation can't go on indefinitely.

447
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:35,443
We're not under some spell.

448
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:37,992
This isn't some sorcerer's castle.

449
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:40,873
Only by dispassionate analysis

450
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:43,372
can we get to the bottom
of our inaction.

451
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:45,749
Here's what I propose.

452
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:47,964
Let's have a moment of silence

453
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,629
and make a supreme effort,

454
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:55,806
a firm act of will demonstrating
our resolve to leave here -

455
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,382
Shut up, Nóbile.

456
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:59,475
That's the best thing you can do.

457
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:01,724
You led us into this trap.

458
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:04,852
You've made us the butt
of this cruel joke.

459
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:06,228
I have, my friend?

460
00:37:06,975 --> 00:37:09,148
By inviting you to dinner?

461
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,195
By opening my doors to you?

462
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:12,488
Exactly.

463
00:37:12,856 --> 00:37:16,235
You called us one by one
to come for dinner after the opera.

464
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:19,575
Such a cordial invitation.

465
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:21,782
“I'd be honored if you would - ”
Et Cetera.

466
00:37:21,865 --> 00:37:25,836
We could have been sound asleep at home
or in some brothel, instead of here.

467
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:30,249
Tell me, what prompted
that untimely invitation?

468
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:32,421
Untimely? Why?

469
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:34,886
You were all delighted.

470
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:38,511
You yourself expressed pleasure
at such a warm reception.

471
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:40,759
Well, I take it back
and hereby state

472
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:44,312
that the only one responsible
for this degrading situation

473
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:45,559
is you.

474
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:47,056
Me?

475
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:50,355
I think you've lost your mind, Raul.

476
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:53,271
Edmundo's right.
You're a fool.

477
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:55,027
If you weren't a lady -

478
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:05,701
Look at the butler.
The water tastes fine to him.

479
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:07,457
My head aches.

480
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:20,139
What are the men here
doing about this?

481
00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:22,263
Gabbing like streetwalkers.

482
00:38:22,342 --> 00:38:25,141
Silvia, think of something
to get us all out of here.

483
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,555
I'll never set foot in this brothel again.

484
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:29,562
Don't be alarmed by his nervousness.

485
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:32,235
He's as sensitive as a little girl.

486
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:36,861
This is affecting him
more than the rest of us.

487
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,988
Don't upset me more
than I already am!

488
00:38:39,526 --> 00:38:41,324
Can't you see how nervous I am?

489
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:43,951
I don't want to hear or see anyone.

490
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:55,592
I'm happy

491
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:58,762
that I won't see the extermination.

492
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:04,343
I wouldn't mind dying either.

493
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:06,974
But not like this,

494
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:10,690
surrounded by people,
unable to be alone with you.

495
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,392
That's my great torment:

496
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:14,227
the fact we can't be alone.

497
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:18,698
Actually, there is a way
to get away from the others.

498
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:21,614
It can't be. How?

499
00:39:21,943 --> 00:39:24,071
I'll tell you when they're all asleep,

500
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:26,121
if indeed they decide to sleep.

501
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:47,722
When I lifted the lid,

502
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,975
I saw a steep cliff,

503
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:52,311
and a rushing stream far below.

504
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:54,522
And before I sat down,

505
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:56,854
an eagle flew by 40 feet below me.

506
00:39:56,936 --> 00:40:00,611
The wind blew
a gust of dry leaves in my face.

507
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:03,155
I'm cold.

508
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,047
<i>Consummatum est.</i>

509
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:07,381
Really?

510
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:09,638
Just what we needed.

511
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,886
Our bodies should evaporate
when we die.

512
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,605
They'll lose heart
when they see him in the morning.

513
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:17,187
Roco could have gone in his place.

514
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:19,652
After all, what's one less conductor?

515
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:22,401
What shall we do?

516
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:02,858
- Did they see you?
- Yes. I don't know.

517
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:04,777
It doesn't matter.

518
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:46,110
<i>Here it flows into the sea.</i>

519
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:47,944
<i>I can?!</i>

520
00:42:48,024 --> 00:42:49,992
<i>Come further down!</i>

521
00:42:51,444 --> 00:42:55,745
<i>Your Rictus! Horrible!</i>

522
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,958
<i>My love!</i>

523
00:42:58,284 --> 00:43:00,127
<i>MY death!</i>

524
00:43:00,203 --> 00:43:02,126
<i>Back into the fold!</i>

525
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:12,651
- Nothing, sir.
- What would you like us to do?

526
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:15,111
I don't know,
but we can't go on like this forever.

527
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:18,494
Four days ago, the mayor felt
it most important

528
00:44:18,573 --> 00:44:20,826
to establish communication
with those cut off inside.

529
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:24,295
He told me to install loudspeakers
so that those inside - if they're alive -

530
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:26,589
could hear and follow our instructions.

531
00:44:26,956 --> 00:44:30,005
But he gave up the idea
when he realized how absurd it was.

532
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:32,507
Absurd? Why?
Seems very workable to me.

533
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:37,092
It would be even easier
to walk in the front door,

534
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:39,052
since nothing's stopping us,

535
00:44:39,177 --> 00:44:40,850
yet no one has gone in yet.

536
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:42,396
That's absolutely right.

537
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:46,601
We sent in a fully equipped
team of men yesterday afternoon.

538
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:49,187
By 9:00 <i>p.m.,</i>
they were back in the barracks.

539
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:51,739
Not one of them
had gotten in the house.

540
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:54,738
But did they really try to get in?

541
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:57,195
No, that's the worst part.

542
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:06,083
<i>We want to see what's going on inside.
We 're not dogs! Let us by!</i>

543
00:45:23,346 --> 00:45:24,347
One.

544
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:27,270
Two.

545
00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:31,066
Three.

546
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:32,612
<i>Four.</i>

547
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:35,532
Why are you taking so long?
lt's so easy!

548
00:45:35,608 --> 00:45:37,281
What is it?

549
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:42,915
- Let me go ahead. I've got a fever.
- So do I. Wait your turn.

550
00:45:45,201 --> 00:45:46,874
You stepped on my foot!

551
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:50,044
Must people wear
their damned shoes everywhere?

552
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:52,420
Why is it taking so long?

553
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:55,295
Let's hope they haven't cut off
the water from outside.

554
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:59,048
<i>228, 229...</i>

555
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:02,059
Go help them!

556
00:46:03,219 --> 00:46:05,267
Excuse me.

557
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:27,994
Get away! Women first!

558
00:46:30,663 --> 00:46:34,088
Get back!
Let the ladies go first!

559
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:36,089
Didn't you hear him?
Stop pushing!

560
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:40,924
Form a line! One cup to start!
Later you can have all you want!

561
00:46:41,007 --> 00:46:44,728
Drinking too quickly is dangerous,
especially when you're ill.

562
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:46,395
Use moderation.

563
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:50,858
Didn't you hear?
Women first! Get in line!

564
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:52,435
Here. Drink.

565
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:54,895
I won't allow you
to abuse my brother.

566
00:47:00,026 --> 00:47:01,903
It's so nice and cold.

567
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:17,919
I'm hungry-

568
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:20,592
Don't eat.

569
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:22,765
Don't leave me alone!

570
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:36,945
He hasn't spoken in two days,

571
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:39,607
his eyes closed,
cut off from everyone,

572
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,363
including me.

573
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:43,532
And you say it's nothing.

574
00:47:43,611 --> 00:47:45,238
I'll say it again, Alicia.

575
00:47:45,321 --> 00:47:47,198
He's suffering
from the same thing we all are,

576
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:50,911
though perhaps, due to his age,
it's affected him more.

577
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:54,589
<i>My hands are like dry branches.</i>

578
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:57,841
<i>We'd have been
better off not finding water.</i>

579
00:47:57,917 --> 00:48:00,045
We're only prolonging the end.

580
00:48:00,378 --> 00:48:02,472
Then don't drink.

581
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:05,307
What are you eating?

582
00:48:05,383 --> 00:48:06,851
Paper, miss.

583
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:09,853
Not very appetizing,
but it deceives the stomach.

584
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:12,352
If it didn't disgust me -

585
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:15,310
The taste isn't unpleasant,
Miss Beatriz.

586
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:18,609
My friends and I
ate it when we were kids.

587
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:21,315
Maybe 'cause we were bored in class.

588
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:25,244
I went to a Jesuit school.
Good people.

589
00:48:25,653 --> 00:48:28,497
We were bored, like most kids are.

590
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:30,624
Paper is good.

591
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:34,545
They say it's made from leaves
and tender tree bark,

592
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,338
so it can't be harmful.

593
00:48:37,498 --> 00:48:39,250
If you'd like to try -

594
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:42,261
<i>Julio, come here.</i>

595
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:44,009
Excuse me.

596
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:52,430
Hold this rag there.

597
00:48:52,513 --> 00:48:55,392
<i>Don't go! Don't leave me alone!</i>

598
00:48:56,684 --> 00:48:59,733
O prince, save me!

599
00:49:00,396 --> 00:49:01,898
Our pact.

600
00:49:40,561 --> 00:49:42,939
I can't take any more, Ana!

601
00:49:44,899 --> 00:49:47,869
I can't stand seeing that monster
comb half her hair!

602
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:50,120
I hate her.

603
00:49:50,446 --> 00:49:53,575
I prefer hunger and thirst
over putting up with her.

604
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,082
Why don't you comb it the right way?

605
00:50:05,211 --> 00:50:06,713
Like this.

606
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:10,432
All the way down.

607
00:50:11,759 --> 00:50:13,761
We won't put up
with your strange quirks.

608
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:19,104
Excuse me, Beatriz.

609
00:50:20,184 --> 00:50:22,858
Did you happen to see a silver box

610
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:25,857
with some white capsules inside?

611
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:27,487
A box?

612
00:50:28,234 --> 00:50:31,363
No, Rita. I'm sorry.

613
00:50:31,612 --> 00:50:33,660
It's Cristian's medicine.

614
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:36,454
We guarded it like gold,

615
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:40,121
but we're all a bit-

616
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:42,456
I'll look around for it.

617
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:51,181
I'm hungry-

618
00:50:52,258 --> 00:50:54,556
The dinner set on the table -

619
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:57,562
isn't there a lump of sugar left?

620
00:50:57,805 --> 00:50:59,557
I'm sorry, ma'am.

621
00:50:59,807 --> 00:51:02,651
There's been nothing for days.

622
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:12,824
Are you feeling better?

623
00:51:13,112 --> 00:51:15,991
Try to hold on. <i>lt'll</i> turn up.

624
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,914
I'm sure someone found the box

625
00:51:18,993 --> 00:51:21,041
and hid it again so I'd croak.

626
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,713
Don't say that.

627
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:24,999
You know what?

628
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:30,046
I do nothing but wonder,

629
00:51:30,296 --> 00:51:32,219
“What are they doing now?”

630
00:51:32,298 --> 00:51:36,895
I can't forget
my poor children either.

631
00:51:37,386 --> 00:51:40,890
But I'm consoled knowing the deacon
will care for them as we would.

632
00:51:40,973 --> 00:51:42,270
The deacon!

633
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:46,024
That's what bothers me most:
Our children are in that hypocrite's hands!

634
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:47,525
Don't be unfair.

635
00:51:47,688 --> 00:51:49,361
Don't deny he was wooing you,

636
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:51,992
to use a euphemism.

637
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:55,158
But I'd best keep my mouth shut.
- No, speak!

638
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:58,040
Is our conversation that interesting?

639
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:02,495
I don't give a damn about you
and your pathetic marital problems.

640
00:52:04,455 --> 00:52:06,457
You're an insolent boor,

641
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:09,510
and I've treated you as such
since we came here.

642
00:52:09,752 --> 00:52:11,379
I couldn't care less.

643
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:14,048
I've despised you
since long before that.

644
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:17,468
Gentlemen, your attitudes -

645
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:21,393
We're all in the same boat.

646
00:52:21,472 --> 00:52:23,941
It wouldn't hurt
to be polite to each other.

647
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:26,272
You should keep your mouth shut.

648
00:52:26,352 --> 00:52:27,820
I agree.

649
00:52:27,895 --> 00:52:31,775
You have to be a real cynic
to give advice to your victims.

650
00:52:31,857 --> 00:52:33,734
My victims?

651
00:52:34,026 --> 00:52:36,154
Why, Raul?

652
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:37,579
Tell me.

653
00:52:37,655 --> 00:52:39,874
<i>L'll</i> feel better
if you give me a good reason.

654
00:52:40,032 --> 00:52:42,251
I'm tired of explaining.

655
00:52:42,326 --> 00:52:45,330
Edmundo, come with me.
Don't say any more.

656
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:47,255
Don't get them any more worked up.

657
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:55,222
Have a seat.

658
00:52:57,383 --> 00:53:00,102
Please sit with me, Alvaro.

659
00:53:02,763 --> 00:53:05,107
You're my friend.

660
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:07,856
I swear I'd give my life
to put an end to this -

661
00:53:07,935 --> 00:53:09,812
to this situation.

662
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:12,777
Suffering horrifies me.

663
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:15,776
I've always tried to relieve it
wherever I could.

664
00:53:16,944 --> 00:53:19,322
How could they believe that I -

665
00:53:19,405 --> 00:53:20,998
lt's all right.

666
00:53:21,073 --> 00:53:22,746
Calm down.

667
00:53:25,661 --> 00:53:27,880
I'm hungry-

668
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:31,629
Think of a way to get us
out of this nightmare!

669
00:53:31,792 --> 00:53:34,136
Only a miracle will get us out of here.

670
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:37,802
Why don't we organize a rosary?

671
00:53:39,133 --> 00:53:42,228
Edmundo and I have promised
with all our hearts

672
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:44,688
to offer a solemn mass

673
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:48,692
if divine providence delivers us
from this captivity.

674
00:53:52,396 --> 00:53:54,319
That unbearable stench!

675
00:53:54,982 --> 00:53:56,279
It's horrible!

676
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:59,157
We're trying to get rid of it.

677
00:54:06,452 --> 00:54:09,797
<i>Don't go! Don't leave me alone!</i>

678
00:54:28,307 --> 00:54:29,980
<i>I'm cold.</i>

679
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:33,270
<i>I'm cold.</i>

680
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:07,224
Blanca, your hair.

681
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:09,648
Remember what I told you.
- Doctor.

682
00:55:13,101 --> 00:55:15,149
What can we do?

683
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:17,189
The poor thing is suffering terribly.

684
00:55:25,781 --> 00:55:30,036
I can't take it anymore, Doctor.
Why don't you just kill me?

685
00:55:30,202 --> 00:55:31,670
Don't talk nonsense.

686
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:33,918
You got through last night quite well.

687
00:55:35,249 --> 00:55:39,720
Painkillers are as vital now
as food itself.

688
00:55:39,795 --> 00:55:42,719
We don't even have an aspirin!

689
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:44,846
Don't leave me. I'm begging you.

690
00:55:46,468 --> 00:55:49,096
Your presence comforts me.

691
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:55,194
If we get out of here, if I'm cured,

692
00:55:55,269 --> 00:55:57,863
I want to go to Lourdes with you.

693
00:55:57,938 --> 00:56:00,157
Promise me you'll go.

694
00:56:00,232 --> 00:56:01,700
You will, won't you?

695
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:03,527
I promise.

696
00:56:04,945 --> 00:56:08,040
We'll prostrate ourselves
at the feet of the Virgin,

697
00:56:08,282 --> 00:56:12,207
because she's the one
who'll get us out of here.

698
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:14,371
Don't talk too much.
Don't excite yourself.

699
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:16,377
It can do you serious harm.

700
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:20,043
When we get to Lourdes,

701
00:56:20,544 --> 00:56:23,718
I want you to buy me
one of those washable plastic Virgins.

702
00:56:25,132 --> 00:56:27,476
You will, won't you?

703
00:57:02,461 --> 00:57:04,338
Where did you get this?

704
00:57:04,504 --> 00:57:07,303
We used to call this room
our “Theban paradise.”

705
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:10,636
We'd gather some friends
once in a while

706
00:57:11,303 --> 00:57:13,397
and spend a few unforgettable hours.

707
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:16,183
Why didn't you tell me
you had this earlier?

708
00:57:16,475 --> 00:57:18,477
Under the present circumstances,

709
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:21,442
imagine if the others should find out.

710
00:57:21,605 --> 00:57:23,357
What once provided pleasure

711
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:26,201
can now serve to alleviate pain.

712
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:28,658
This contains Laudanine,
codeine and morphine.

713
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:30,493
Morphine? Where?

714
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:47,260
- What was that about?
- What's it to you?

715
00:57:47,631 --> 00:57:48,723
What?

716
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:51,768
What are they hiding?

717
00:57:52,052 --> 00:57:54,555
You'll see when everyone's asleep.

718
00:58:00,102 --> 00:58:02,821
<i>- I'm hungry.
- Quiet.</i>

719
00:58:03,063 --> 00:58:06,237
<i>This is too much.
Have some consideration.</i>

720
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:14,408
You smell like a hyena.

721
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:16,076
What did you say?

722
00:58:16,243 --> 00:58:18,211
I said you smell like a hyena.

723
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:20,914
How dare you!

724
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:22,632
Why do you insult me?

725
00:58:22,791 --> 00:58:25,294
You should be ashamed
to bring up things

726
00:58:25,377 --> 00:58:27,300
the rest of us overlook
out of dignity.

727
00:58:27,379 --> 00:58:29,256
Why are you afraid of the truth?

728
00:58:29,423 --> 00:58:32,893
She smells bad.
So do you, and I and everybody.

729
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:36,351
We're living like pigs in a pigsty.

730
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:39,600
You disgust me, all of you!

731
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:41,352
I hate you!

732
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:49,117
Pay no attention to him.
He's on edge.

733
00:58:54,573 --> 00:58:57,417
This will end very badly, my dear.

734
00:58:57,492 --> 00:59:00,166
Everything I've most hated
since I was a child -

735
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:03,832
rudeness, violence, filth -

736
00:59:04,833 --> 00:59:07,803
are now our inseparable companions.

737
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:14,013
Death is preferable to this anarchy!

738
01:01:30,395 --> 01:01:32,113
What did she do?

739
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:34,608
Don't you see?

740
01:01:34,774 --> 01:01:36,447
We should tie her hands.

741
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:39,951
- Get her out of here this minute!
- Sure, call an ambulance.

742
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:41,498
She's got a high fever.

743
01:01:41,615 --> 01:01:44,869
Use cold compresses
and change them every five minutes.

744
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:47,750
Don't cry, Alicia. lt's over now.

745
01:01:47,913 --> 01:01:51,133
They'll watch so that nothing
like that happens again.

746
01:02:01,051 --> 01:02:02,553
Will it make me nauseous?

747
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:06,064
Yes, but it'll ease your pain.
You'll sleep well tonight.

748
01:02:30,789 --> 01:02:32,416
What day is today?

749
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:34,130
What?

750
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:37,546
How long have we been here?

751
01:02:37,712 --> 01:02:39,931
Over a month, isn't it?

752
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:41,679
Not that long.

753
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:44,928
We couldn't have lasted
that long without food.

754
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:48,102
It feels like we've always been here.

755
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:51,063
I have the same feeling.

756
01:02:51,726 --> 01:02:53,694
And we'll be here forever.

757
01:02:57,357 --> 01:02:58,654
Unless -

758
01:02:58,733 --> 01:02:59,950
What?

759
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:03,196
Unless we escape together,

760
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:06,457
lose ourselves in the shadows.

761
01:03:09,577 --> 01:03:11,295
You don't answer?

762
01:03:13,123 --> 01:03:15,967
Wherever you go,
I'll go too, Eduardo.

763
01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:34,568
Look.

764
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:37,071
Just as we thought.

765
01:03:43,236 --> 01:03:45,079
What's that?

766
01:04:39,084 --> 01:04:41,382
<i>- What is it now?
- Quiet.</i>

767
01:04:41,461 --> 01:04:43,088
<i>Who stepped on my hand?</i>

768
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:46,516
- What happened?
- I don't know. I must've been dreaming.

769
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:48,389
I'm not blind, sir.

770
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:52,932
- What the hell are you saying?
- You're no gentlemen. You're an incubus!

771
01:04:53,014 --> 01:04:55,938
Cristian, please.
You're making a fool of yourself.

772
01:04:56,017 --> 01:04:57,735
You'd better watch your tongue.

773
01:04:57,811 --> 01:04:59,279
Calm down, gentlemen.

774
01:04:59,354 --> 01:05:00,856
What's happened, gentlemen?

775
01:05:00,939 --> 01:05:03,783
The colonel sneaks around
in the dark like a thief.

776
01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:05,075
You swine!

777
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:08,280
Let's settle this once and for all.
I challenge you to a duel.

778
01:05:08,363 --> 01:05:09,580
I accept.

779
01:05:09,656 --> 01:05:12,159
What a madhouse.
No one can get any sleep.

780
01:05:12,325 --> 01:05:16,421
Look at him.
Another mess N6bile's gotten us into.

781
01:05:16,496 --> 01:05:18,544
Don't you understand he has an ulcer?

782
01:05:21,376 --> 01:05:23,424
This is madness!

783
01:05:23,503 --> 01:05:25,346
Calm down first.
Then you can talk.

784
01:05:25,422 --> 01:05:29,393
Just don't come to blows.
This is below us.

785
01:05:29,551 --> 01:05:32,851
Gentlemen, remember your upbringing.

786
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:37,101
I'd like to know
if Nóbile started this.

787
01:05:37,267 --> 01:05:40,692
We have to show him
that he can't mess with us.

788
01:05:40,854 --> 01:05:43,698
I prefer not to answer.

789
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:46,026
Fine - until we run out of patience.

790
01:05:46,109 --> 01:05:48,783
Try to calm him down.
Talk to him.

791
01:05:48,862 --> 01:05:51,661
I can never forgive him for this.
He's shamed me.

792
01:05:51,739 --> 01:05:53,741
Stop fighting
and find us something to eat!

793
01:05:53,825 --> 01:05:55,498
Leave me alone!

794
01:05:56,578 --> 01:05:58,546
Alvaro, how could you?

795
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:02,376
Even the best among us
are losing their heads.

796
01:06:02,459 --> 01:06:04,803
Please have pity on me!

797
01:06:11,259 --> 01:06:14,388
I apologize, to you and everyone.

798
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:18,684
I don't how I could have done that.
I wasn't myself.

799
01:06:19,184 --> 01:06:22,358
Once again, I apologize.

800
01:06:25,356 --> 01:06:27,734
Allow me to make a suggestion

801
01:06:27,901 --> 01:06:30,245
that I hope will be satisfactory.

802
01:06:30,737 --> 01:06:34,583
To avoid unfortunate
incidents like this,

803
01:06:35,533 --> 01:06:37,035
I suggest

804
01:06:37,118 --> 01:06:40,793
the women sleep on one side of the room
and the men on the other.

805
01:06:40,872 --> 01:06:43,341
Excuse me, but you're speaking
to gentlemen.

806
01:06:43,416 --> 01:06:45,760
Forget him. He's a degenerate.

807
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:47,845
He insists on insulting us.

808
01:06:47,921 --> 01:06:49,673
Edmundo's right.

809
01:06:49,923 --> 01:06:51,721
I just thought, for everyone's sake -

810
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:55,303
Don't say any more.
Don't you understand -

811
01:07:59,826 --> 01:08:00,827
There you go.

812
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:03,834
Now, remember:
Keep your wits about you.

813
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:05,415
Let's go.

814
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:09,085
Hey, where are you going?

815
01:08:09,168 --> 01:08:12,263
This is Don Cristian's family
just here for a look,

816
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:15,137
so the children can see the house
where their parents are.

817
01:08:15,216 --> 01:08:17,093
Go ahead.

818
01:08:25,435 --> 01:08:27,233
I know I can go in

819
01:08:27,312 --> 01:08:29,440
and speak to them -
if they're still alive -

820
01:08:29,522 --> 01:08:32,742
then come back out and give
an account of the situation.

821
01:08:32,817 --> 01:08:34,740
Are you sure?

822
01:08:35,028 --> 01:08:37,247
- Try me.
- Over here.

823
01:08:38,656 --> 01:08:41,125
You won't accept my proposal?

824
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:44,545
I'll go to the press,
to the powers that be.

825
01:08:44,621 --> 01:08:46,544
I must be heard.

826
01:08:46,706 --> 01:08:50,301
I'm certain I can solve this problem.

827
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:52,133
Another lunatic.

828
01:08:58,009 --> 01:09:00,728
Go on. Don't just stand there.

829
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:04,148
- Why do you stop?
- Keep walking.

830
01:09:04,223 --> 01:09:06,066
The important thing
is that he keep walking.

831
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:08,190
Go on!
- Go on, boy!

832
01:09:08,269 --> 01:09:10,397
Go in!

833
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:13,112
Why didn't you keep going?

834
01:09:13,191 --> 01:09:16,161
You know how kids are.
- Go on. Try it again.

835
01:09:16,235 --> 01:09:18,738
No. Let's go.

836
01:10:05,952 --> 01:10:09,547
If we don't want to sink
into utter debasement,

837
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:12,250
we must maintain rigorous hygiene

838
01:10:12,333 --> 01:10:14,176
and strict order during our stay here.

839
01:10:15,002 --> 01:10:18,131
Today we'll organize a cleaning team.

840
01:10:20,675 --> 01:10:22,302
How are you feeling?

841
01:10:22,593 --> 01:10:24,061
Fine.

842
01:10:24,137 --> 01:10:26,105
My head's a little -

843
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:27,773
Poor man.

844
01:10:27,932 --> 01:10:30,401
If it weren't for you and Leticia -

845
01:10:30,476 --> 01:10:32,319
They're savages.

846
01:10:32,395 --> 01:10:35,524
I can't thank those two enough
for standing up for you.

847
01:10:44,407 --> 01:10:46,330
It was a premonition.

848
01:10:46,993 --> 01:10:49,371
Before going to the opera that night,

849
01:10:49,454 --> 01:10:52,424
I heard an insistent voice telling me,

850
01:10:52,915 --> 01:10:56,260
“Take the keys with you.”

851
01:10:56,335 --> 01:10:57,962
The keys?

852
01:10:58,421 --> 01:11:00,423
In Kabbalah we use the word “keys”

853
01:11:00,506 --> 01:11:04,306
for the magical objects that can unlock
the doors to the unknown.

854
01:11:05,678 --> 01:11:07,806
Take this, Blanca.

855
01:11:07,889 --> 01:11:09,391
Hold it tight.

856
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:11,851
Like this.

857
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:15,150
And Silvia.

858
01:11:15,855 --> 01:11:17,698
You hold this the opposite way.

859
01:11:17,857 --> 01:11:19,359
Like this.

860
01:11:42,173 --> 01:11:43,925
Victim!

861
01:12:08,199 --> 01:12:09,917
I'm not feeling anything.

862
01:12:10,076 --> 01:12:12,078
I need the blood of an innocent.

863
01:12:12,829 --> 01:12:15,582
We'll have to wait
for the last lamb to be sacrificed.

864
01:12:30,721 --> 01:12:32,223
What is it?

865
01:12:32,431 --> 01:12:33,774
Look!

866
01:12:36,352 --> 01:12:38,104
In the closet.

867
01:13:00,626 --> 01:13:02,970
Friends.

868
01:13:06,966 --> 01:13:08,593
What's wrong?

869
01:13:08,676 --> 01:13:10,178
That's it.

870
01:13:14,307 --> 01:13:16,935
Doctor, in there.

871
01:13:23,691 --> 01:13:25,364
What's going on?

872
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:34,623
Leandro, Colonel, help me.

873
01:13:34,702 --> 01:13:36,375
Keep everyone back.

874
01:13:37,538 --> 01:13:39,916
Alvaro, let me see.

875
01:13:40,499 --> 01:13:42,467
- How did they do it?
- That doesn't matter.

876
01:13:42,543 --> 01:13:44,090
Please stay back.

877
01:14:23,668 --> 01:14:25,136
What's wrong with you?

878
01:14:26,045 --> 01:14:27,547
I was thinking...

879
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:32,810
of the look on your face
if I pushed you

880
01:14:32,885 --> 01:14:34,637
into the salon.

881
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:36,563
Try it and I'll kill you.

882
01:14:51,737 --> 01:14:53,535
What does that mean?

883
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:56,497
They've probably lost
the few wits they had left.

884
01:14:56,575 --> 01:14:58,828
It's the Masonic cry for help.

885
01:14:59,245 --> 01:15:02,624
Any Mason in hearing distance
is supposed to come to his aid.

886
01:15:02,790 --> 01:15:05,168
But in this case,
unless the bear's a Mason...

887
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:17,689
Cristian, the time has come.

888
01:15:18,305 --> 01:15:20,228
The unpronounceable word.

889
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:24,023
<i>H.
- l.</i>

890
01:15:24,729 --> 01:15:27,073
- H.
- H.

891
01:15:27,565 --> 01:15:29,943
- O.
- H.

892
01:16:44,058 --> 01:16:45,401
<i>Help!</i>

893
01:16:45,893 --> 01:16:47,736
<i>Quick, close the windows!</i>

894
01:16:48,854 --> 01:16:50,697
<i>It's every man for himself!?</i>

895
01:16:51,732 --> 01:16:54,326
<i>There'll be millions of people
in the room any minute.</i>

896
01:16:56,153 --> 01:16:59,327
<i>I13 very late, my son.
Come to bed.</i>

897
01:16:59,698 --> 01:17:01,075
<i>I'm not sleepy.</i>

898
01:17:02,535 --> 01:17:04,208
<i>What a multitude!</i>

899
01:17:04,453 --> 01:17:06,501
<i>He died in a state of mortal sin.</i>

900
01:17:39,738 --> 01:17:43,242
<i>My beloved son!</i>

901
01:17:45,244 --> 01:17:49,215
<i>I'll never see you again!</i>

902
01:17:49,582 --> 01:17:52,882
<i>Look there.
Up on the peak! See him?</i>

903
01:17:53,127 --> 01:17:54,470
<i>The pope.</i>

904
01:17:54,545 --> 01:17:56,388
<i>Yes, it's him.</i>

905
01:17:56,463 --> 01:17:58,761
<i>Full of majesty and power,</i>

906
01:17:58,841 --> 01:18:00,138
<i>like a warrior.</i>

907
01:18:14,190 --> 01:18:16,363
<i>I'll adjust the pillow for you.</i>

908
01:18:18,152 --> 01:18:21,622
<i>Good night, son.
- Good night, Mom.</i>

909
01:19:23,634 --> 01:19:25,352
Nothing. Same as before.

910
01:19:25,636 --> 01:19:26,933
Quiet as a tomb.

911
01:19:27,012 --> 01:19:28,639
And that yellow flag?

912
01:19:28,722 --> 01:19:31,350
They've quarantined the house
like in an epidemic.

913
01:19:31,433 --> 01:19:33,276
I'd prefer typhus.

914
01:19:33,394 --> 01:19:34,691
<i>Pablo!</i>

915
01:19:35,229 --> 01:19:37,448
Well, well, what wind
blew you this way?

916
01:19:37,523 --> 01:19:39,776
The same as you, chef.

917
01:19:39,858 --> 01:19:41,326
Any news?

918
01:19:41,402 --> 01:19:44,451
- None. Unless they've all croaked.
- You think so?

919
01:19:44,530 --> 01:19:47,124
They say foul odors
reach as far as the street.

920
01:19:47,283 --> 01:19:50,628
Maybe everything
we left in the kitchen rotted.

921
01:19:58,460 --> 01:19:59,712
Don't shoot!

922
01:19:59,795 --> 01:20:02,139
Don't kill him, please!

923
01:20:02,214 --> 01:20:05,218
He's very tame.
I'm a servant in this house.

924
01:20:07,177 --> 01:20:10,306
Did you tell the cook
and the maids we were coming?

925
01:20:10,472 --> 01:20:11,815
Me? I didn't say a word.

926
01:20:11,890 --> 01:20:13,813
- Then what are they doing here?
- Beats me.

927
01:20:13,892 --> 01:20:17,317
Let's go find out.
Maybe there's some news.

928
01:20:54,391 --> 01:20:58,316
Raul said all this will end
when Nóbile dies.

929
01:20:58,395 --> 01:21:00,818
When the spider dies,
the web unravels.

930
01:21:00,898 --> 01:21:03,526
If he had any decency,
he'd know what to do.

931
01:21:03,609 --> 01:21:05,782
He and Leticia
have hidden themselves away.

932
01:21:06,445 --> 01:21:10,075
I order you to be quiet.
lt's the decent thing to do.

933
01:21:10,741 --> 01:21:13,039
And you gentlemen, speak openly.

934
01:21:13,118 --> 01:21:15,086
Let us all know what you're plotting.

935
01:21:15,245 --> 01:21:17,293
We want to put an end to him.

936
01:21:17,456 --> 01:21:19,049
Put an end to him?

937
01:21:19,208 --> 01:21:20,755
Have you gone mad?

938
01:21:20,918 --> 01:21:23,717
This is absurd.
Completely unreasonable.

939
01:21:23,796 --> 01:21:26,595
We don't want reason.
We want out of here.

940
01:21:26,673 --> 01:21:28,801
If you want a fight, you'll have one!

941
01:21:28,926 --> 01:21:32,726
Alvaro, step aside.
Our quarrel's not with you or the doctor.

942
01:21:32,805 --> 01:21:34,478
Necessity justifies our actions.

943
01:21:34,556 --> 01:21:36,558
- Kill him!
- Once and for all!

944
01:21:38,977 --> 01:21:40,399
First hear me out.

945
01:21:40,479 --> 01:21:44,154
Kill the doctor too.
He stands in our way.

946
01:21:44,983 --> 01:21:48,578
Consider the terrible consequences
of your actions.

947
01:21:49,154 --> 01:21:52,033
This vile act of aggression
does not stand alone.

948
01:21:52,324 --> 01:21:55,168
It means the very end of human dignity

949
01:21:55,494 --> 01:21:57,622
and reverting to savage animals.

950
01:21:57,704 --> 01:21:59,456
Step aside, Doctor,

951
01:21:59,540 --> 01:22:01,713
or I won't be responsible
for my actions.

952
01:22:01,792 --> 01:22:03,635
Enough talking! Get him!

953
01:22:12,302 --> 01:22:13,929
Enough, Raul!

954
01:22:14,012 --> 01:22:15,685
Don't complicate matters more!

955
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:18,438
I told you to stay out of this!

956
01:22:30,237 --> 01:22:31,705
Look, it's Nóbile!

957
01:22:34,158 --> 01:22:36,331
There's no need for violence.

958
01:22:37,161 --> 01:22:40,131
No use fighting over something
so easily achieved.

959
01:22:43,292 --> 01:22:45,386
Thank you, Leticia.

960
01:23:23,081 --> 01:23:25,584
Edmundo, wait.
Stay where you are.

961
01:23:28,629 --> 01:23:30,427
What is it, Leticia?

962
01:23:30,714 --> 01:23:32,387
I don't know.

963
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:34,802
Actually, I do.

964
01:23:36,386 --> 01:23:40,266
It's so... extraordinary.

965
01:23:41,975 --> 01:23:43,852
How long have we been here?

966
01:23:45,312 --> 01:23:47,485
I don't know. I've lost track.

967
01:23:48,273 --> 01:23:52,528
But think how many times
each of us has changed places...

968
01:23:54,571 --> 01:23:57,745
during this horrible eternity here.

969
01:24:02,663 --> 01:24:06,964
Like pieces on a chess board,
moved thousands of times.

970
01:24:08,001 --> 01:24:09,674
Even the furniture.

971
01:24:09,753 --> 01:24:12,256
We've moved it around
a hundred times.

972
01:24:14,925 --> 01:24:16,051
But look now.

973
01:24:16,885 --> 01:24:20,355
Right now all of us -

974
01:24:21,223 --> 01:24:23,442
people and furniture -

975
01:24:24,268 --> 01:24:28,239
are exactly where we were that night.

976
01:24:29,731 --> 01:24:31,779
Or am I hallucinating again?

977
01:24:31,858 --> 01:24:33,531
Tell me, Alvaro.

978
01:24:33,610 --> 01:24:35,157
Tell me, all of you!

979
01:24:36,196 --> 01:24:37,994
It's true.

980
01:24:38,282 --> 01:24:40,080
I was right here.

981
01:24:40,158 --> 01:24:41,910
Weren't you at my side?

982
01:24:42,828 --> 01:24:45,923
And to my left -
- Me, just like I am now.

983
01:24:47,165 --> 01:24:49,213
And we were on this sofa.

984
01:24:49,293 --> 01:24:51,341
I held your hand in mine.

985
01:24:52,588 --> 01:24:53,840
Who can remember?

986
01:24:54,256 --> 01:24:58,602
After dinner, I sat down at the piano,
where I am now.

987
01:24:58,677 --> 01:25:00,179
And you were there.

988
01:25:01,513 --> 01:25:02,605
That's right.

989
01:25:02,681 --> 01:25:04,649
Fine.

990
01:25:05,017 --> 01:25:07,691
But what difference
does any of this make?

991
01:25:14,526 --> 01:25:18,030
Blanca, do you remember
the piece you were playing?

992
01:25:19,197 --> 01:25:20,790
Perfectly well.

993
01:25:21,867 --> 01:25:23,869
The last piece I played

994
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:27,123
was a sonata by Paradisi.

995
01:25:27,205 --> 01:25:28,582
Play it now.

996
01:25:28,665 --> 01:25:30,633
Just the ending.

997
01:25:31,001 --> 01:25:33,845
You hear me? Play it.

998
01:25:34,379 --> 01:25:36,177
Play it.

999
01:25:40,510 --> 01:25:43,309
You were standing behind me.

1000
01:25:43,889 --> 01:25:45,391
Stand up.

1001
01:26:15,921 --> 01:26:17,594
You all applauded.

1002
01:26:19,424 --> 01:26:21,518
You stepped down from the piano.

1003
01:26:21,593 --> 01:26:23,470
Some of your friends approached.

1004
01:26:25,430 --> 01:26:26,932
Who spoke first?

1005
01:26:30,268 --> 01:26:32,646
Try to remember!

1006
01:26:32,729 --> 01:26:34,151
You must remember!

1007
01:26:45,242 --> 01:26:47,336
A delightful performance.

1008
01:26:48,620 --> 01:26:50,247
Answer her, Blanca.

1009
01:26:50,330 --> 01:26:52,173
What would you have said?

1010
01:26:55,127 --> 01:26:58,848
Pity there was no harpsichord.

1011
01:26:59,756 --> 01:27:03,932
It would have sounded perfect.

1012
01:27:05,262 --> 01:27:09,233
Please play some Scarlatti for us.

1013
01:27:09,307 --> 01:27:11,981
It's too late to play
any more, isn't it?

1014
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:14,062
It's 3:00 in the morning.

1015
01:27:14,146 --> 01:27:16,114
You'll have to forgive me.

1016
01:27:16,356 --> 01:27:19,200
It's late, and I'm tired.

1017
01:27:19,276 --> 01:27:21,995
Exactly. We're all tired.

1018
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:24,243
It's very late,
and we must be going.

1019
01:27:32,456 --> 01:27:33,924
Let's go!

1020
01:27:33,999 --> 01:27:36,548
Follow me, everybody!

1021
01:27:37,878 --> 01:27:39,721
Come on! Follow me!

1022
01:27:52,142 --> 01:27:54,315
This way!

1023
01:28:15,165 --> 01:28:17,418
It's good. ls it from inside?

1024
01:28:17,501 --> 01:28:19,174
I've only got two bottles left.

1025
01:28:22,047 --> 01:28:23,720
Look! A light!

1026
01:28:27,010 --> 01:28:28,683
Camila, come here!

1027
01:28:29,846 --> 01:28:31,393
Look, a light!

1028
01:28:31,473 --> 01:28:34,397
It's them.
- Holy Virgin!

1029
01:28:34,976 --> 01:28:37,149
- Let's go in.
- You first.

1030
01:31:09,422 --> 01:31:11,925
Why don't we wait
until after the faithful have left?

1031
01:31:12,008 --> 01:31:14,477
After? Why?

1032
01:31:14,552 --> 01:31:15,895
<i>Well...</i>

1033
01:31:25,981 --> 01:31:27,403
Father.

1034
01:31:30,652 --> 01:31:32,029
Somethings wrong.

1035
01:31:32,112 --> 01:31:34,160
We should let
everyone else leave first.

1036
01:31:34,239 --> 01:31:35,866
That's what I told you.

1037
01:31:35,949 --> 01:31:37,622
I forgot my prayer book.

1038
01:31:39,285 --> 01:31:41,754
- Why don't they leave?
- Let me by.

1039
01:31:42,372 --> 01:31:43,840
Let me explain.

1040
01:31:43,915 --> 01:31:46,384
- You first.
- There's no rush.

1041
01:31:46,459 --> 01:31:48,837
This is too much. Come on.

1041
