1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Do you want subtitles for any video?
-=[ ai.MY-SUBS.com ]=-

2
00:00:22,303 --> 00:00:23,623
Who is it from?

3
00:00:24,273 --> 00:00:26,063
I cant guess from
the handwriting.

4
00:00:27,212 --> 00:00:28,503
M. Mitra

5
00:00:30,093 --> 00:00:31,903
Must be someone on your
mothers side.

6
00:00:33,374 --> 00:00:34,951
I dont know of any
M. Mitra.

7
00:00:50,709 --> 00:00:52,703
They say, therell be no power
cuts during the holidays.

8
00:00:54,836 --> 00:00:56,783
Well? Whos it from?

9
00:01:10,245 --> 00:01:11,783
Whose letter is it, Mummy?

10
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:13,503
- Just a moment.

11
00:01:13,943 --> 00:01:17,319
Ok. Like a massive...

12
00:01:20,765 --> 00:01:21,543
Well?

13
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:30,503
Is it some bad news?

14
00:01:32,303 --> 00:01:33,303
I dont know.

15
00:01:34,472 --> 00:01:35,663
Dont know?

16
00:01:37,702 --> 00:01:39,223
Whos that from, Mummy?

17
00:01:41,303 --> 00:01:42,783
Your great uncle!

18
00:01:44,112 --> 00:01:46,088
The one who ran away from home?

19
00:01:46,165 --> 00:01:47,823
But hes been missing for ages!

20
00:01:49,303 --> 00:01:52,739
35 years! He left in 1955.

21
00:01:53,983 --> 00:01:55,583
I was only two then.

22
00:01:56,259 --> 00:01:57,423
And your uncle?

23
00:01:59,265 --> 00:02:01,263
He left immediately
after graduation.

24
00:02:02,619 --> 00:02:04,263
I dont remember him at all.

25
00:02:06,388 --> 00:02:08,383
Later, my mother told me
everything.

26
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:13,263
Last time we heard from him
was in 1968.

27
00:02:14,035 --> 00:02:17,263
He never wrote to any of his
relatives.

28
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:21,824
Only to Mr. Sital. A post
cover every 6 months or so.

29
00:02:22,106 --> 00:02:24,503
From various places in Europe.

30
00:02:25,834 --> 00:02:28,583
It was not possible to reply
because he gave no address.

31
00:02:29,113 --> 00:02:32,503
This Sital was a family friend,
wasnt he?

32
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,672
Yes.
He was grandpas neighbour.

33
00:02:35,749 --> 00:02:37,423
He has been to see us also.

34
00:02:38,977 --> 00:02:43,903
Oh yes. He was in the
Governors accounts department.

35
00:02:44,308 --> 00:02:46,223
He has retired and is living in
Shanti Niketan, isnt it?

36
00:02:47,902 --> 00:02:49,903
It was from him that
uncle learnt about us.

37
00:02:50,183 --> 00:02:51,263
Where has he written from?

38
00:02:52,518 --> 00:02:53,423
New Delhi.

39
00:02:55,334 --> 00:02:56,663
Qutub Hotel.

40
00:03:05,571 --> 00:03:08,143
Anyway, just read me
the letter, will you?

41
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:13,903
I must say his command of
Bengali is admirable.

42
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,642
My dear Baby.

43
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:19,903
Baby? Who is baby?

44
00:03:20,349 --> 00:03:22,423
Let me read it, will you?

45
00:03:24,559 --> 00:03:26,361
My dear Baby.

46
00:03:26,438 --> 00:03:28,312
I dont know your real name.

47
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,743
Oh! Im addressing you
in this fashion.

48
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,423
I hope you wont mind.

49
00:03:33,194 --> 00:03:34,823
Thats very florid style.

50
00:03:35,893 --> 00:03:39,903
When I left home, you were
no more than a baby.

51
00:03:39,979 --> 00:03:42,717
I have finished my travels
in the West...

52
00:03:42,794 --> 00:03:44,903
and have only just arrived here.

53
00:03:45,133 --> 00:03:48,803
Learnt from
Mr. Sital that...

54
00:03:48,985 --> 00:03:52,423
youre my only
close relation left...

55
00:03:53,278 --> 00:03:57,423
and are settled happily.
Your husband and son...

56
00:03:57,903 --> 00:04:01,903
I shall soon resume
my wanderings.

57
00:04:02,423 --> 00:04:05,732
In the meantime,
I dearly wish...

58
00:04:05,809 --> 00:04:08,415
to spend a week as the
guest of my niece...

59
00:04:08,563 --> 00:04:11,023
in the city of my birth.

60
00:04:11,802 --> 00:04:14,310
You wont know this uncle
of yours by sight...

61
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:16,183
as I wont know you.

62
00:04:16,635 --> 00:04:18,863
I realize that in the
instance my request...

63
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:21,423
amounts to an imposition.

64
00:04:21,741 --> 00:04:25,423
In our country,
in the old days,...

65
00:04:25,701 --> 00:04:28,317
hospitality was extended even...

66
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:31,423
to total strangers.

67
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,329
It is the thought
of this tradition...

68
00:04:34,406 --> 00:04:37,743
that gives me the courage
to make this request.

69
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:39,418
I have decided.

70
00:04:39,495 --> 00:04:42,903
We leave by the Rajdhani
Express on the 16th...

71
00:04:42,979 --> 00:04:45,903
and arrive in Calcutta
on the 17th morning.

72
00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:49,016
I shall then turn up at
your house in a taxi.

73
00:04:49,598 --> 00:04:52,423
It is certainly up to you
to accept me...

74
00:04:52,628 --> 00:04:55,903
as a guest or not.

75
00:04:56,307 --> 00:04:57,370
Let me assure you.

76
00:04:57,447 --> 00:05:02,903
Im used to experiences
both bitter and sweet.

77
00:05:03,338 --> 00:05:04,841
Yours affectionately,...

78
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:07,783
Uncle Manmohan Mitra.

79
00:05:08,903 --> 00:05:11,423
You have no memories
of your uncle.

80
00:05:12,223 --> 00:05:15,423
You even recall whether he is
stout or thin or tall or short.

81
00:05:17,223 --> 00:05:17,903
No.

82
00:05:19,287 --> 00:05:23,423
So there is only one thing.
Send an immediate reply...

83
00:05:23,903 --> 00:05:25,983
by telegram, a letter wont do.

84
00:05:39,147 --> 00:05:41,563
Tell him a bare faced lie?

85
00:05:42,278 --> 00:05:43,722
What do you mean a lie?

86
00:05:43,871 --> 00:05:45,743
That people go on holidays...?

87
00:05:45,903 --> 00:05:47,903
Doesnt know Im an executive...

88
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:49,903
as if I were a professor?

89
00:05:50,223 --> 00:05:52,133
We are enjoying a long holiday
on autumn, wouldnt I?

90
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:54,092
That youre not professor.

91
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,903
How can you be sure that
this man isnt lying?

92
00:05:57,063 --> 00:05:59,183
You know how common fraud
is these days?

93
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,823
Theres a priceless art collection...

94
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:07,326
in that sitting room alone.
Subjects worth a million rupees.

95
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,623
Take just one bronze figurine...

96
00:06:10,183 --> 00:06:12,157
from the top
of the book shelf...

97
00:06:12,233 --> 00:06:13,423
and you can make a fortune...

98
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,823
by selling it to a
foreign tourist.

99
00:06:16,974 --> 00:06:18,903
You mean he is coming
to commit a theft

100
00:06:23,756 --> 00:06:26,143
Uncle was a great
favourite of my mother.

101
00:06:26,637 --> 00:06:28,423
Dad too was very fond of him.

102
00:06:29,493 --> 00:06:30,947
It was not without reason.

103
00:06:31,179 --> 00:06:32,558
Uncle was very gifted.

104
00:06:33,022 --> 00:06:34,903
Never stood second in his life.

105
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:43,119
Here a person can change
beyond recognition.

106
00:06:43,858 --> 00:06:45,623
It doesnt seem so
from the letter.

107
00:06:48,167 --> 00:06:51,139
Ill assume that he is
indeed your uncle...

108
00:06:51,513 --> 00:06:53,103
and a model of virtue.

109
00:06:53,688 --> 00:06:56,063
Wont you give your husband
a little thought?

110
00:06:57,175 --> 00:06:58,423
What do you mean?

111
00:07:03,593 --> 00:07:06,903
Says hes coming on
the 17th, Friday.

112
00:07:07,578 --> 00:07:09,256
That hell stay for a week.

113
00:07:09,332 --> 00:07:12,183
Means, the whole weekend
would be ruined.

114
00:07:12,703 --> 00:07:14,903
The autumn festival
starts on 21st.

115
00:07:15,903 --> 00:07:17,865
I thought Id relax
during the holidays.

116
00:07:18,131 --> 00:07:19,725
Now comes this old man...

117
00:07:20,049 --> 00:07:21,303
claiming to be your uncle.

118
00:07:28,551 --> 00:07:31,423
Come in dear sir. Sit down.
Have a meal dear, sir.

119
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:33,764
Dont like it at all.

120
00:07:33,841 --> 00:07:34,983
What?

121
00:07:35,059 --> 00:07:36,743
Your attitude, what else?

122
00:07:36,903 --> 00:07:38,903
You cant send this telegram
in answer to this letter.

123
00:07:39,063 --> 00:07:41,903
As a thoroughly decent letter!
- I dont deny that.

124
00:07:43,047 --> 00:07:47,423
In fact, its a little too
decent. - Thats the trouble.

125
00:07:47,621 --> 00:07:49,365
How can a man whos been
away from home so long...

126
00:07:49,442 --> 00:07:51,423
write such elegant Bengali?

127
00:07:52,903 --> 00:07:56,696
Maybe he got someone else
to write for him.

128
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:58,423
But the sentiment is
surely his own.

129
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,903
No. Theres a snag in it.

130
00:08:06,004 --> 00:08:07,063
Very well.

131
00:08:12,423 --> 00:08:14,343
Is grand uncle coming, mummy?

132
00:08:16,332 --> 00:08:17,703
Ask Daddy.

133
00:08:22,658 --> 00:08:23,623
What is it now?

134
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,463
Are you cross with me
or something?

135
00:08:43,008 --> 00:08:44,610
A fake uncle is better than
no uncle.

136
00:08:44,687 --> 00:08:48,423
Is that what you wish to say?
- Wish to say only one thing.

137
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,423
Whats the need for a
letter or a telegram?

138
00:08:51,623 --> 00:08:53,743
He says he is coming here
on the 17th.

139
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:54,640
Let him come.

140
00:08:54,717 --> 00:08:56,077
If I find him a fake...

141
00:08:56,153 --> 00:08:57,854
or he’s real, but has come
with an ulterior motive,...

142
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:00,183
then you wont have
to do anything.

143
00:09:00,423 --> 00:09:02,423
I myself will whisk him
away with a broom.

144
00:09:06,605 --> 00:09:10,423
Just think - a fake great uncle!

Madhu, when youve done

bring a flask of cold
and put it on the table.

159

You stay there and call,
but when he comes...

160
00:13:20,063 --> 00:13:21,894
Mummy!

161
00:13:28,611 --> 00:13:30,743
Come down for the luggage,
You there.

162
00:13:47,343 --> 00:13:49,263

Lord Krishnas pupil
or Sudhindra Boses son?

165
00:14:03,581 --> 00:14:05,663
Your name?
- Anila.

166
00:14:08,962 --> 00:14:11,263
Did you get my letter?
- Oh, yes.

167
00:14:12,242 --> 00:14:13,743
I didnt get a reply.

168
00:14:14,176 --> 00:14:15,827
I hope you didnt write
asking me not to come.

169
00:14:15,904 --> 00:14:16,775
No, no.

170
00:14:25,344 --> 00:14:27,743
You think I dont know
Ive put you in a spot?

171
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,263
Asking you to accept someone
youve hardly seen...

172
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,658
as your uncle...

173
00:14:32,982 --> 00:14:34,263
Why do you say that?

174
00:14:34,463 --> 00:14:36,903
Its good to find a thing
one had taken as lost

175
00:14:38,868 --> 00:14:40,172
I presume your husband is...

176
00:14:40,249 --> 00:14:42,743
in the office - Theres no
work tomorrow and day after...

177
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:45,263
and the Durga festival
starts on the 21st.

178
00:14:45,661 --> 00:14:46,663
I see.

179
00:14:47,743 --> 00:14:49,703
Can I get you a cold drink?

180
00:14:49,953 --> 00:14:52,023
A little rest and then
you can have your bath.

181
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,423
Very well, but no ice please.

182
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:13,863
Half a mind to buy some
sweets for you and the boy.

183
00:15:14,023 --> 00:15:17,023
Then I realized I didnt
know where to go for these...

184
00:15:17,398 --> 00:15:20,023
would probably end up
buying inferior stuff.

185
00:15:29,836 --> 00:15:33,543
The old confectioners Ganguram...
still there?

186
00:15:33,619 --> 00:15:36,183
Oh yes, there are many new ones.

187
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,023
Why this tastes a lot
like Coca Cola?

188
00:15:39,517 --> 00:15:41,543
Is this made here?
- Yes.

189
00:15:43,684 --> 00:15:48,023
Good Lord! - This isnt how you
spell Thumbs up, Satyaki?

190
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,165
Oh, no.

191
00:15:52,343 --> 00:15:53,703
Thats better.

192
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,863
You go to school, I suppose?

193
00:15:58,181 --> 00:16:00,743
Yes, now we have a months
holiday for festivals.

194
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:03,543
On the way, I saw some houses
with decorations...

195
00:16:04,165 --> 00:16:06,543
which suggested Id come
during the festival.

196
00:16:06,743 --> 00:16:08,073
Have you watched a Durga festival
in all these years...

197
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:10,543
youve been away?
- No.

198
00:16:10,863 --> 00:16:12,543
But Ive seen
Lord Krishnas Chariot.

199
00:16:12,743 --> 00:16:14,348
Dyou know where?

200
00:16:14,425 --> 00:16:16,743
Madison Avenue in New York

201
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:19,554
Its the same here.

202
00:16:19,631 --> 00:16:22,023
Swarming with white skinned
followers of Krishna.

203
00:16:22,343 --> 00:16:24,943
They are the men that
ring out the Chariot, not us

204
00:16:25,246 --> 00:16:30,663
Do you know the 108 names
of Lord Krishna?

205
00:16:31,263 --> 00:16:32,343
No.

206
00:16:52,623 --> 00:16:54,463
My grandma used to sing it.

207
00:16:54,623 --> 00:16:56,186
Ill teach you.

208
00:16:59,137 --> 00:17:00,543
Youll have a bath, wont you?

209
00:17:03,783 --> 00:17:05,138
If it isnt too much trouble.

210
00:17:05,592 --> 00:17:08,023
Not at all. Your rooms
upstairs.

211
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,743
Satyaki will show you.

212
00:17:10,846 --> 00:17:11,884
You have a lovely house.

213
00:17:11,961 --> 00:17:13,522
My father-in-law built it.

214
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,543
And your husband
has inherited it?

215
00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:17,303
Come, Satyaki

216
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:27,169
By the way, I know nothing
about your taste in food

217
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:31,223
Dear, Im Omnivorous
and a small eater.

218
00:17:31,463 --> 00:17:33,183
So, you have nothing
to worry about.

219
00:17:41,813 --> 00:17:44,463
Has he come?
- Yes, just 10 minutes ago.

220
00:17:46,701 --> 00:17:49,263
What shall I say?
Seems a jovial person.

221
00:17:49,691 --> 00:17:52,183
He uses endearing terms when
talking to me. I quite like it!

222
00:17:52,607 --> 00:17:55,623
But you havent addressed
as dear uncle, already?

223
00:17:57,795 --> 00:17:59,103
Im not so gullible.

224
00:17:59,933 --> 00:18:02,766
Goodness! Does he
resemble your mother?

225
00:18:03,814 --> 00:18:05,623
No, but one thing he
shares with her.

226
00:18:05,973 --> 00:18:07,623
What?
- A singing voice.

227
00:18:08,623 --> 00:18:11,806
Hes already been singing
for you?

228
00:18:12,823 --> 00:18:15,480
Oh, no. Just a couple
of lines.

229
00:18:16,923 --> 00:18:17,823
Hows his Bengali?

230
00:18:18,615 --> 00:18:20,023
Better than yours or mine.

231
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:24,983
What? I find that
very suspicious.

232
00:18:25,495 --> 00:18:27,183
Listen.
- What now?

233
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:29,463
Ask to see his passport.

234
00:18:31,628 --> 00:18:33,995
Theres no sounder proof
of identity than that.

235
00:18:34,337 --> 00:18:36,783
Are you out of your mind?
You think a woman can do that?

236
00:18:37,451 --> 00:18:38,623
You do that when you meet him.

237
00:18:38,823 --> 00:18:40,463
I cant be bothered.
Im hanging up.

238
00:19:01,863 --> 00:19:03,183
Weve come.

239
00:19:04,996 --> 00:19:06,688
Kurta Pyjama. I hope
this dress will do.

240
00:19:06,765 --> 00:19:07,983
Certainly!

241
00:19:08,383 --> 00:19:10,383
I had nothing that
I could wear here.

242
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,383
So I bought these in Delhi.

243
00:19:12,749 --> 00:19:14,063
Come in.

244
00:19:20,383 --> 00:19:21,783
Thats fish.

245
00:19:22,568 --> 00:19:23,863
Sit down, please.

246
00:19:27,183 --> 00:19:30,183
Since youre omnivorous,
you mustnt skip any items.

247
00:19:30,863 --> 00:19:34,863
But I also said small eater,
remember?

248
00:19:38,157 --> 00:19:40,863
I suggest you put aside
the meat for dinner.

249
00:19:41,383 --> 00:19:43,183
Ill have the fish now.

250
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:53,622
Do you know what this is?

251
00:19:53,699 --> 00:19:55,783
I told you how long since I’ve
tasted Bengali dishes.

252
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,317
You wouldnt believe me.

253
00:19:57,514 --> 00:19:58,634
This is curried spinach.

254
00:20:00,181 --> 00:20:02,463
You know Popeye the sailor,
Satyaki?

255
00:20:02,672 --> 00:20:05,383
Oh yes, its spinach that
gives him strength.

256
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:14,383
Heres something new.

257
00:20:14,819 --> 00:20:17,863
Good Lord! What are these?
- Fancy crisps.

258
00:20:18,023 --> 00:20:20,383
The women of Midnapore
prepare them at home.

259
00:20:23,658 --> 00:20:26,253
Edible embroideries.
This could only happen in Bengal.

260
00:20:26,471 --> 00:20:28,183
Give me one, mummy.

261
00:20:31,941 --> 00:20:33,217
Wont you join us, dear?

262
00:20:33,394 --> 00:20:35,065
Ill eat, when youve finished.

263
00:20:35,142 --> 00:20:37,383
That means, you havent
become a Memsahib yet.

264
00:20:45,623 --> 00:20:48,297
You say you havent tasted
Bengali cooking all these years.

265
00:20:48,494 --> 00:20:50,383
But there are any number of
Bengalis in the West.

266
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,703
In New York alone,
we know so many of them.

267
00:20:53,081 --> 00:20:54,863
Havent you had anything
to do with them?

268
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:58,863
Once Ive broken free
of my moorings...

269
00:20:59,506 --> 00:21:01,383
why hobnob with Bengalis
anymore?

270
00:21:02,744 --> 00:21:04,487
But you havent forgotten
the language.

271
00:21:04,564 --> 00:21:06,583
You speak it well,
write it well.

272
00:21:07,196 --> 00:21:09,143
Ill take lentil first
then fish.

273
00:21:09,305 --> 00:21:10,743
So do we.

274
00:21:12,112 --> 00:21:13,383
You know what, dear?

275
00:21:14,545 --> 00:21:17,863
Unless you wish to forget your
mother tongue, you dont forget it.

276
00:21:18,623 --> 00:21:21,383
But if you do, you can
do so in 3 months.

277
00:21:22,491 --> 00:21:24,863
And for that you didnt have
to leave the country.

278
00:21:25,621 --> 00:21:28,863
In Delhi, I find children
addressing their parents...

279
00:21:29,783 --> 00:21:32,863
as Mummy and Daddy.

280
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,863
Do you do the same, Satyaki?

281
00:21:36,383 --> 00:21:37,383
- Certainly not!

282
00:21:38,143 --> 00:21:39,703
The crisps are eaten
with lentil.

283
00:21:39,974 --> 00:21:43,383
Shall I give you one?
- Very well. Fancy Crisps

284
00:21:57,189 --> 00:21:59,383
Why did you leave home?

285
00:22:00,863 --> 00:22:04,294
Mother told me
everyone loved you.

286
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,863
And you were a fine student
with a bright future.

287
00:22:08,485 --> 00:22:10,863
But yet why I left home?
- Yes.

288
00:22:12,143 --> 00:22:15,863
Theres a lovely word in
German, Wanderlust.

289
00:22:17,225 --> 00:22:19,383
It means the irrepressible
urge to travel.

290
00:22:19,863 --> 00:22:21,783
Is that the only reason?

291
00:22:21,943 --> 00:22:23,823
Its true that Ive always
felt that urge.

292
00:22:24,133 --> 00:22:25,783
But there was another reason.

293
00:22:26,748 --> 00:22:27,871
Will you take the fish now?

294
00:22:29,108 --> 00:22:30,783
Id rather have the mutton.

295
00:22:31,145 --> 00:22:33,383
Fish bones will hamper
my speech.

296
00:22:43,865 --> 00:22:45,383
Enough. Enough.

297
00:22:51,023 --> 00:22:53,023
You havent said
what the other reason was.

298
00:22:53,659 --> 00:22:58,581
So you are listening to me,
are you?

299
00:22:59,383 --> 00:23:01,863
Ill tell you.
Itll amuse you!

300
00:23:02,779 --> 00:23:05,110
I used to draw very well
as a small boy

301
00:23:05,243 --> 00:23:07,190
Yes, mother used to say so.

302
00:23:07,329 --> 00:23:10,863
I had decided to join
an art school...

303
00:23:10,939 --> 00:23:13,863
after finishing my studies.

304
00:23:14,383 --> 00:23:17,383
One day, in my first year
at college...

305
00:23:19,005 --> 00:23:22,143
a foreign journal fell
into my hands.

306
00:23:22,825 --> 00:23:27,383
I opened it and found a
full page picture of a bison.

307
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:30,383
Not a photo, but a painting.

308
00:23:31,142 --> 00:23:32,383
You know what a bison is?

309
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,630
Yes, they have horns
on their heads.

310
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:35,676
Yes, this bison was charging...

311
00:23:35,862 --> 00:23:36,945
with head bent and
horns sticking out.

312
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:41,383
You know, dear? It was an
extraordinary painting.

313
00:23:42,383 --> 00:23:45,863
Such poise!
Such a bold stance!

314
00:23:47,014 --> 00:23:49,143
As if it was painted
by Da Vinci.

315
00:23:49,459 --> 00:23:50,863
Who was this painter?

316
00:23:51,743 --> 00:23:53,383
Who was that unique draughtsman?

317
00:23:54,048 --> 00:23:55,863
Then I read the caption
underneath.

318
00:23:56,023 --> 00:23:58,383
It said the bison was painted
2000 years ago...

319
00:23:58,543 --> 00:23:59,863
in the stone age...

320
00:24:00,023 --> 00:24:01,863
in a place called
Altamita Spain...

321
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:04,383
by a cave dwelling
primitive man.

322
00:24:05,503 --> 00:24:08,863
I found it so astonishing
that I said to myself...

323
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:11,383
Salutes to you Mr. Bison.

324
00:24:11,775 --> 00:24:15,380
Whatever else I may become,
I shall never become a painter.

325
00:24:16,065 --> 00:24:17,863
Because there is no art
school in the world...

326
00:24:18,596 --> 00:24:20,703
where you can learn
to draw a bison like this.

327
00:24:22,023 --> 00:24:27,383
This gave me the urge
to explore the question...

328
00:24:27,543 --> 00:24:31,863
of savagery and civilization.

329
00:24:32,863 --> 00:24:35,383
And to this was added
wanderlust.

330
00:24:36,094 --> 00:24:38,383
The two together made me
leave home.

331
00:24:50,142 --> 00:24:51,835
Youve said you were planning
to set off again.

332
00:24:52,161 --> 00:24:54,623
This visit to Australia.

333
00:24:54,783 --> 00:24:55,715
I havent been to
that part at all.

334
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:02,383
This is Greek coin, a Drachma

335
00:25:04,611 --> 00:25:06,083
This is Polish - Zloty.

336
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,547
This is Mexican - Pesito.

337
00:25:16,263 --> 00:25:19,183
This is a Sol - from Peru

338
00:25:21,183 --> 00:25:24,303
Anishs uncle also collects coins,
I know what theyre called.

339
00:25:24,379 --> 00:25:25,197
What?

340
00:25:30,925 --> 00:25:32,863
I dont collect coins.

341
00:25:34,171 --> 00:25:36,183
Its not my hobby.

342
00:25:37,551 --> 00:25:39,183
These were lying with me.

343
00:25:40,147 --> 00:25:44,383
And now they belong to you.
- To me, really?!

344
00:25:44,718 --> 00:25:46,239
You can show these
to your friends.

345
00:25:46,315 --> 00:25:48,783
Ive already told my friends.

346
00:25:49,143 --> 00:25:52,383
Some of them, not all.
- What?

347
00:25:52,609 --> 00:25:54,903
That we now have a guest
in our house,...

348
00:25:55,383 --> 00:25:59,337
who may or may not be
my great uncle.

349
00:26:00,459 --> 00:26:02,583
Theyre going to see you
in a little while.

350
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:09,863
Come along now.
Dont you want him to rest?

351
00:26:10,233 --> 00:26:11,383
Im going.

352
00:26:13,053 --> 00:26:14,063
What?

353
00:26:17,383 --> 00:26:20,383
A German word.
It means, well meet again.

354
00:26:27,383 --> 00:26:33,383
Just think - Andes, the highest
mountain in South America.

355
00:26:34,987 --> 00:26:38,863
On this mountain, at a height
of 8000 feet...

356
00:26:39,438 --> 00:26:41,383
a city built of stone.

357
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,160
For 4000 years the city
had laid hidden...

358
00:26:45,544 --> 00:26:46,863
from human eyes,

359
00:26:47,797 --> 00:26:50,383
Then, in 1911,...

360
00:26:51,038 --> 00:26:52,863
the year Mohun Bagan beat
the British football team...

361
00:26:53,023 --> 00:26:54,863
and won the IFA shield,...

362
00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:00,863
that very year an explorer
called Hiran Bingham,...

363
00:27:00,987 --> 00:27:05,383
suddenly chanced upon this city.

364
00:27:06,237 --> 00:27:09,143
What name did I say?
- Machu Picchu

365
00:27:13,383 --> 00:27:14,398
Here you are.

366
00:27:18,013 --> 00:27:20,212
Have you been to this city?

367
00:27:20,289 --> 00:27:23,383
Of course, the picture
is taken by me.

368
00:27:24,583 --> 00:27:28,383
I went twenty years ago
on mule back.

369
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:30,863
I was struck dumb.

370
00:27:31,863 --> 00:27:33,863
Everything there is
made of stone.

371
00:27:34,383 --> 00:27:36,863
Yet there are no stones
for miles around

372
00:27:37,383 --> 00:27:39,143
Where they found the stone...

373
00:27:39,383 --> 00:27:42,383
and how they carried it
up to the hill side,...

374
00:27:42,583 --> 00:27:44,063
nobody knows.

375
00:27:44,515 --> 00:27:46,903
It was truly wonderful,
the Inca Civilization.

376
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,863
Tell us another story!
- No, not a story.

377
00:27:51,274 --> 00:27:53,383
This time Ill show you a trick.

378
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:02,863
Ill ask you a few questions.

379
00:28:03,855 --> 00:28:05,863
Lets see if you can
answer them correctly.

380
00:28:09,143 --> 00:28:13,383
Tell me, Which is large,
Moon or Sun?

381
00:28:13,675 --> 00:28:14,783
Sun?

382
00:28:15,863 --> 00:28:17,383
How do you know?

383
00:28:18,032 --> 00:28:19,103
Just a moment.

384
00:28:24,863 --> 00:28:26,383
Suppose this is Moon...

385
00:28:27,176 --> 00:28:28,383
.. and this is Sun.

386
00:28:30,143 --> 00:28:33,023
In the sky, they look the
same size, dont they?

387
00:28:33,675 --> 00:28:35,383
Thats because the sun is
much further away?

388
00:28:35,689 --> 00:28:36,543
How much?

389
00:28:37,517 --> 00:28:38,783
Ill tell you.

390
00:28:39,158 --> 00:28:41,863
The sun is 95 million
miles away.

391
00:28:42,863 --> 00:28:45,383
While the moon distance is
only five hundred thousand miles.

392
00:28:46,206 --> 00:28:48,383
Thats why, Sun looks bigger.

393
00:28:48,863 --> 00:28:55,298
Suppose the moon had been
200000 miles away,...

394
00:28:55,583 --> 00:28:57,863
then it would have
looked bigger.

395
00:28:59,553 --> 00:29:01,863
Like this. Isnt that so?
- Yes.

396
00:29:02,583 --> 00:29:06,143
And suppose the moon had been
800000 miles away...

397
00:29:06,383 --> 00:29:08,360
Then it would have looked
smaller.

398
00:29:08,437 --> 00:29:10,863
Somewhat like this, isnt it?

399
00:29:13,863 --> 00:29:15,383
But neither happens.

400
00:29:15,743 --> 00:29:19,167
The moon is just far enough away
that it makes it look the...

401
00:29:22,059 --> 00:29:23,383
the same size as the Sun.

402
00:29:24,719 --> 00:29:27,863
Thats why, when the Moon
takes it position,...

403
00:29:28,753 --> 00:29:30,863
in front of the Sun
and slowly covers it,...

404
00:29:32,165 --> 00:29:35,137
disc matching disc.

405
00:29:35,785 --> 00:29:37,023
Solar Eclipse!

406
00:29:38,756 --> 00:29:40,383
Yes, total eclipse of the Sun.

407
00:29:40,863 --> 00:29:43,823
And when the earths shadow
falls on the Moon...

408
00:29:43,983 --> 00:29:45,783
then also the two
discs match perfectly.

409
00:29:45,943 --> 00:29:47,268
Lunar Eclipse!

410
00:29:47,344 --> 00:29:49,383
Total eclipse of Moon!

411
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,383
What dyou think
made that possible?

412
00:30:00,987 --> 00:30:01,863
You dont know.

413
00:30:02,793 --> 00:30:04,823
Ask the wisest man on earth
and even he will say...

414
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,343
he doesnt know.

415
00:30:06,503 --> 00:30:07,583
Nobody knows.

416
00:30:08,383 --> 00:30:09,863
Its a mystery!

417
00:30:10,383 --> 00:30:13,383
I say its one of the greatest
mysteries of the universe.

418
00:30:14,383 --> 00:30:16,383
Sun and Moon.

419
00:30:16,583 --> 00:30:18,623
King of the day!
Queen of the night!

420
00:30:19,383 --> 00:30:23,863
And the shadow of Earth on the Moon...
all exactly the same size.

421
00:30:25,552 --> 00:30:26,611
Magic!

422
00:30:40,703 --> 00:30:41,703
Listen!

423
00:30:42,436 --> 00:30:43,137
What?

424
00:30:43,214 --> 00:30:44,383
Come here a moment.

425
00:30:48,543 --> 00:30:51,543
Im convinced.
- That hes your uncle?

426
00:30:51,619 --> 00:30:53,543
Yes, and a very nice man.

427
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:57,023
So you are gullible, after all.

428
00:30:58,543 --> 00:31:01,343
In these few hours, you found out
everything about a man?

429
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:03,023
Women are capable of that.

430
00:31:03,543 --> 00:31:05,543
They take people on trust.

431
00:31:06,353 --> 00:31:07,750
And surely you can tell a lot,...

432
00:31:07,827 --> 00:31:10,543
from the way a man acts and
walks and the look in his eyes.

433
00:31:12,343 --> 00:31:14,743
And there is no doubt that
he has been abroad.

434
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,543
He knows German.

435
00:31:17,158 --> 00:31:19,023
And he has given my son
some foreign coins.

436
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,543
Foreign coins?

437
00:31:25,023 --> 00:31:27,023
I suppose you know one can
buy foreign postage stamps.

438
00:31:27,723 --> 00:31:29,543
There are dealers in coins too.

439
00:31:30,543 --> 00:31:34,543
Tell me what coin you want.
Ill get you one tomorrow.

440
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:41,023
Anyway, I only said what I felt.

441
00:31:42,023 --> 00:31:43,943
Has he given any reasons
for leaving home?

442
00:31:44,103 --> 00:31:46,223
It was in that connection that
he used a German word

443
00:31:46,383 --> 00:31:47,703
Which means an urge to travel.

444
00:31:50,543 --> 00:31:51,543
Wanderlust?

445
00:31:52,067 --> 00:31:54,543
Yes, but he pronounced it
differently.

446
00:31:58,024 --> 00:31:58,543
Yes.

447
00:31:58,743 --> 00:32:00,400
The word is used in English too.

448
00:32:00,477 --> 00:32:02,543
And pronounced in the
English way.

449
00:32:03,743 --> 00:32:06,543
I studied German at the Goethe
Institute for a couple of months.

450
00:32:06,784 --> 00:32:08,543
Then lost patience!

451
00:32:09,129 --> 00:32:12,023
I still have a stock of 5
or so German words.

452
00:32:13,883 --> 00:32:14,943
What else did he say?

453
00:32:16,239 --> 00:32:17,143
About what?

454
00:32:18,293 --> 00:32:20,183
Leaving home, what else?

455
00:32:20,383 --> 00:32:22,543
He said a lot. Ill take a long
time to tell you everything.

456
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:25,023
Im interested to know.

457
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:27,543
Bison. Does that mean
anything to you?

458
00:32:36,257 --> 00:32:39,453
Theres a guest in the house.
You are the host.

459
00:32:40,023 --> 00:32:42,503
Do go and say hello to him.
- Wheres he?

460
00:32:42,723 --> 00:32:44,143
Must be in his room.

461
00:32:44,303 --> 00:32:45,943
Hes been out with
Satyakis friends.

462
00:32:46,106 --> 00:32:47,143
Came back a little while ago.

463
00:32:47,543 --> 00:32:50,023
Come on, get up.

464
00:32:52,094 --> 00:32:54,544
Youd better see about
the broom.

465
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:57,543
Listen.
- What is it now?

466
00:32:57,703 --> 00:33:00,543
I have one favour to ask of you.
- What?

467
00:33:00,856 --> 00:33:03,023
Please pay your respects to
him and touch his feet.

468
00:33:19,953 --> 00:33:21,023
Sudhindra Bose.

469
00:33:23,848 --> 00:33:26,023
No. no, most certainly not.

470
00:33:27,709 --> 00:33:34,023
When your mind is free of doubt,
then you can touch my feet.

471
00:33:35,543 --> 00:33:37,023
Not before then.

472
00:33:39,167 --> 00:33:43,023
I have said in my letter
a line telling you how...

473
00:33:47,743 --> 00:33:49,543
I know who you are.

474
00:33:50,785 --> 00:33:53,543
But you dont know who I am.

475
00:33:55,532 --> 00:33:58,136
Unfortunately, theres no
quick way of finding out.

476
00:33:58,213 --> 00:34:06,213
If I am the real person
or a fake one...

477
00:34:08,358 --> 00:34:10,736
only time will tell you.

478
00:34:11,626 --> 00:34:14,943
You decide whether youre
prepared to wait.

479
00:34:15,903 --> 00:34:20,767
But why do you say
there is no quick way to know?

480
00:34:21,622 --> 00:34:23,183
I feel.

481
00:34:29,543 --> 00:34:31,824
Well. It actually bears
your name...

482
00:34:35,543 --> 00:34:37,023
and your picture too

483
00:34:44,703 --> 00:34:48,145
Then its all right.
Why are you...?

484
00:34:49,271 --> 00:34:51,275
What does this prove?

485
00:34:53,171 --> 00:34:57,518
My identity, youll say.
I say, not even that.

486
00:34:59,824 --> 00:35:02,023
In these days of
global corruption,...

487
00:35:03,139 --> 00:35:06,023
do you know how easy it is
to forge a passport?

488
00:35:11,728 --> 00:35:16,543
Therefore, you have every
right to disbelieve me.

489
00:35:18,477 --> 00:35:21,023
I cant say that to your wife.

490
00:35:22,277 --> 00:35:30,277
She is looking after the guest
in an exemplary fashion.

491
00:35:31,543 --> 00:35:33,543
And it is a question of
blood relationship.

492
00:35:34,637 --> 00:35:37,713
It applies to her, not to you.

493
00:35:41,937 --> 00:35:44,288
Look there. I havent opened
my suitcase yet.

494
00:35:48,147 --> 00:35:50,445
If it comes to that, I can be
out in the street in five minutes.

495
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,023
But why do you say that...

496
00:35:54,743 --> 00:35:56,543
my wife likes you

497
00:36:02,741 --> 00:36:04,023
Forget it.

498
00:36:04,633 --> 00:36:07,023
I am curious only about one thing.
- What?

499
00:36:08,294 --> 00:36:13,023
Why did you decide to come
back after so many years?

500
00:36:14,543 --> 00:36:17,023
Well, youre free to believe me
or not.

501
00:36:22,101 --> 00:36:24,220
It wasnt my wish to
come back home.

502
00:36:25,503 --> 00:36:27,223
Ive done my job in the West.

503
00:36:28,139 --> 00:36:30,303
Now I want to travel East.

504
00:36:31,646 --> 00:36:33,743
I have to stop in Delhi anyway.

505
00:36:34,316 --> 00:36:40,513
Till now, I havent felt any ties
of affection for my relatives.

506
00:36:41,703 --> 00:36:46,223
Perhaps of the fact that Im
getting on in years.

507
00:36:48,152 --> 00:36:49,743
Thats all right.
You may rest now.

508
00:36:49,891 --> 00:36:51,543
Ill just go and have a shower.

509
00:36:58,223 --> 00:37:01,223
You win for the time being.

510
00:37:01,576 --> 00:37:04,543
Passport?
- Its okay.

511
00:37:05,355 --> 00:37:09,943
Did he show it to you?
- Yes, almost without my asking.

512
00:37:10,743 --> 00:37:12,743
Then why say for the time being?

513
00:37:13,319 --> 00:37:14,743
He must be the real uncle.

514
00:37:16,421 --> 00:37:19,223
That man can twist me
around his little finger.

515
00:37:20,294 --> 00:37:22,743
Dyou know what he said?
- What?

516
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:26,743
He says that passport
proves nothing.

517
00:37:27,672 --> 00:37:30,223
He says passports are being
forged everyday now.

518
00:37:32,223 --> 00:37:34,743
Ask to see his passport. - Ask
to see his passport now what?

519
00:37:35,363 --> 00:37:39,482
How could I know that
your so called uncle...

520
00:37:40,631 --> 00:37:42,223
was such a shrewd customer?

521
00:37:47,486 --> 00:37:49,223
What it is, I dont know yet.

522
00:37:51,223 --> 00:37:53,743
I think Ill find out...

523
00:37:55,025 --> 00:37:56,743
tomorrow evening.

524
00:37:57,602 --> 00:37:58,663
What do you mean?

525
00:38:00,259 --> 00:38:04,223
I have asked Pritish to
come tomorrow evening.

526
00:38:04,769 --> 00:38:06,743
Why him?

527
00:38:08,496 --> 00:38:10,863
We need someone who can
talk straight.

528
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:13,444
You know very well...

529
00:38:14,002 --> 00:38:15,863
that your husband is not
such a man.

530
00:38:16,785 --> 00:38:22,063
I suffer from a chronic liability
to come out into the open.

531
00:38:22,463 --> 00:38:23,943
Pritish has no such complaints.

532
00:38:24,609 --> 00:38:28,463
I have told him everything
and he is most intrigued.

533
00:38:29,551 --> 00:38:32,503
He has handled such cases
of impersonation before.

534
00:38:33,503 --> 00:38:35,183
Is he going to
cross question him?

535
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,103
He can be very blunt,
this friend of yours.

536
00:38:39,263 --> 00:38:41,183
What dyou mean?
Cross question?

537
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,343
The man claims to be your
great uncle.

538
00:38:45,724 --> 00:38:47,863
Thats why, weve taken him
as a guest.

539
00:38:48,481 --> 00:38:50,343
We have to feed him, dont we?

540
00:38:50,863 --> 00:38:54,343
Itll cost us at least
Rs.5 a day.

541
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:57,343
And yet we know next to
nothing about the man.

542
00:38:58,677 --> 00:39:01,343
There are certain essential things
we must know about him.

543
00:39:01,819 --> 00:39:05,863
Pritish will find out and do it
as decently as possible.

544
00:39:06,863 --> 00:39:08,244
To me it seems
perfectly feasible.

545
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,863
That a man who had left his
home when his niece was two,...

546
00:39:11,063 --> 00:39:13,652
now wants to see her again
after so many years.

547
00:39:13,729 --> 00:39:15,829
I see nothing wrong in that.

548
00:39:16,565 --> 00:39:17,863
Very well.

549
00:39:18,063 --> 00:39:21,075
If he has come for sentimental reason
then I have nothing to say.

550
00:39:22,184 --> 00:39:25,984
But if I find your uncles
up to no good...

551
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,463
and if he turns out not to
be my uncle?

552
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:36,703
Well, you know what to do.

553
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:40,343
Sweep him away with a broom!

554
00:39:55,183 --> 00:39:56,703
Chanda here.

555
00:39:58,638 --> 00:40:00,103
Cant you recognise my voice?

556
00:40:01,703 --> 00:40:03,463
It sounds so different.

557
00:40:04,901 --> 00:40:08,703
Its nothing but excitement.
Has he come?

558
00:40:08,903 --> 00:40:10,383
Yes, he has.

559
00:40:11,217 --> 00:40:12,446
Of course, its true.

560
00:40:12,522 --> 00:40:14,783
Well, how do you find him?

561
00:40:15,183 --> 00:40:17,023
Hes only arrived today.

562
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:23,930
My husband and I are bursting
with curiosity.

563
00:40:24,615 --> 00:40:28,703
Ever since you told us, weve been
able to think of nothing else.

564
00:40:29,503 --> 00:40:31,263
I hope you havent told
any one else.

565
00:40:31,436 --> 00:40:34,903
Believe me.
Weve been itching to...

566
00:40:35,063 --> 00:40:37,183
but we havent said a word.

567
00:40:37,703 --> 00:40:39,383
Well, now that you know,
Goodbye then.

568
00:40:39,745 --> 00:40:41,976
No. no, wait, Mr. husband
wants to talk to you.

569
00:40:42,053 --> 00:40:43,663
Im handing him the phone.

570
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:51,543
I have a request which
you must keep.

571
00:40:52,052 --> 00:40:53,143
What is it?

572
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:57,743
Wed like to drop in
for just half an hour.

573
00:40:58,237 --> 00:41:01,663
I see. But what if he finds
out that...

574
00:41:01,903 --> 00:41:04,023
Listen.
I give you my word.

575
00:41:04,343 --> 00:41:06,343
He wont find out.

576
00:41:06,583 --> 00:41:08,343
Itll be just one of your
usual social calls.

577
00:41:08,821 --> 00:41:12,343
Well go casually.
Have a casual chat

578
00:41:12,906 --> 00:41:14,823
And then come away casually.

579
00:41:15,543 --> 00:41:19,823
All you have to do is tell Sudhin
not to introduce me as an actor

580
00:41:20,452 --> 00:41:23,343
At least he mustnt know
in the early stages.

581
00:41:23,709 --> 00:41:25,343
Do you want to come
this evening?

582
00:41:25,823 --> 00:41:28,503
Weve double shows on the
weekend, dont you see?

583
00:41:29,823 --> 00:41:31,421
All right, then come
this evening.

584
00:41:38,956 --> 00:41:41,823
Listen...

585
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,118
Whats up?

586
00:41:45,195 --> 00:41:46,577
Ranjan and Chanda are coming
in a little while.

587
00:41:46,654 --> 00:41:48,206
They say they wont let him
know theyve come to see him.

588
00:41:48,282 --> 00:41:53,158
Jolly Good. Ring up all your
other friends too.

589
00:41:53,343 --> 00:41:54,338
Dont be silly.
- Why not?

590
00:41:54,502 --> 00:41:56,937
They can share the responsibility
of entertaining the old man.

591
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:58,180
And listen.

592
00:41:58,257 --> 00:42:00,343
Please introduce him
as my uncle.

593
00:42:04,125 --> 00:42:05,343
May I come in?

594
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,343
I hope Im not intruding?

595
00:42:11,543 --> 00:42:13,700
Not at all.
Let me introduce you.

596
00:42:14,082 --> 00:42:16,075
Mr. and Mrs. Rakhit

597
00:42:16,633 --> 00:42:17,823
Manmohan Mitra.

598
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:27,563
I dont think weve...

599
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:29,583
You havent. He is
Anitas maternal uncle.

600
00:42:29,815 --> 00:42:31,063
Maternal...

601
00:42:44,719 --> 00:42:47,344
No. Im making a mistake.

602
00:42:47,711 --> 00:42:49,343
Another friend of ours.

603
00:42:53,929 --> 00:42:55,823
I think it was Manjus uncle.

604
00:42:56,755 --> 00:42:58,343
Manju never had an uncle.

605
00:43:04,085 --> 00:43:06,783
You have three maternal
uncles, dont you?

606
00:43:06,859 --> 00:43:07,943
No, two.

607
00:43:08,761 --> 00:43:10,823
Two. The elder one
is dead.

608
00:43:10,983 --> 00:43:13,502
The younger one left
35 years ago.

609
00:43:25,794 --> 00:43:27,783
Im getting all mixed up.

610
00:43:27,895 --> 00:43:29,823
You mix up things all the time.

611
00:43:32,823 --> 00:43:37,103
Anilas uncle left home
35 years ago.

612
00:43:37,432 --> 00:43:38,663
He came back this morning.

613
00:43:39,823 --> 00:43:40,823
Where from?

614
00:43:41,284 --> 00:43:42,343
The West.

615
00:43:46,508 --> 00:43:49,823
But this is sensational.
Another Bhawal Sanyasi!

616
00:43:51,345 --> 00:43:53,143
Do you know of the
Bhawal Sanyasi great case?

617
00:43:53,347 --> 00:43:55,343
I do.
- World famous case.

618
00:43:55,792 --> 00:43:58,343
Do you know how long it went on?
Ten years.

619
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:00,263
There is no question of
a court case.

620
00:44:00,423 --> 00:44:01,734
No?
- No.

621
00:44:02,457 --> 00:44:06,343
You mean the fact that
hes Mrs. Boses uncle...

622
00:44:06,554 --> 00:44:07,809
is undisputed.

623
00:44:10,077 --> 00:44:12,343
Well, you dont know
the lawyers these days.

624
00:44:12,952 --> 00:44:16,522
Theyd have wrung you dry.

625
00:44:17,345 --> 00:44:18,783
And youd find yourself out...

626
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,823
on the streets again
with a begging bowl.

627
00:44:38,583 --> 00:44:42,063
I see these are your famous
homemade biscuits.

628
00:44:42,656 --> 00:44:44,351
Famous?

629
00:44:45,771 --> 00:44:47,063
Delicious!

630
00:44:48,594 --> 00:44:52,585
Now that he is back, shouldnt
you announce it to the press?

631
00:44:52,819 --> 00:44:53,600
Ill not.
Im not.

632
00:44:53,739 --> 00:44:57,021
And if I find that a single
journalist has got on to the fact...

633
00:44:57,619 --> 00:44:59,583
I think youre at the
bottom of it.

634
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:03,063
They wont get a
single fact out of me.

635
00:45:04,943 --> 00:45:09,063
But I could see a headline
before my eyes.

636
00:45:15,063 --> 00:45:18,063
Do you know that prodigal has
two meanings, Mr. Rakhit?

637
00:45:19,063 --> 00:45:21,063
Two meanings?

638
00:45:21,665 --> 00:45:27,942
One is wasteful.
And the other is repentant.

639
00:45:28,774 --> 00:45:30,383
Im neither.

640
00:45:31,063 --> 00:45:33,583
Im happy to hear this.

641
00:45:34,434 --> 00:45:37,583
May I ask you something?

642
00:45:38,121 --> 00:45:39,223
Certainly.

643
00:45:39,823 --> 00:45:44,218
We didnt know a thing.

644
00:45:45,287 --> 00:45:47,944
Now that we are here, you know?

645
00:45:48,323 --> 00:45:49,823
Are you back here alone?

646
00:45:50,872 --> 00:45:52,103
There is no one else
to keep me company.

647
00:45:54,307 --> 00:45:56,063
You mean you never married?

648
00:45:57,881 --> 00:46:00,063
Wife would mean a family
and a house.

649
00:46:00,259 --> 00:46:03,223
The whole point is, I didnt wish
to be tied down to a home.

650
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:05,583
I see, I get it.

651
00:46:18,419 --> 00:46:21,063
If youve come back to
Calcutta after ages...

652
00:46:22,450 --> 00:46:23,406
did you start your journey
from Calcutta?

653
00:46:23,483 --> 00:46:25,063
Yes.

654
00:46:25,226 --> 00:46:28,063
Well, how dyou find the city
after such a long time?

655
00:46:28,223 --> 00:46:30,063
Mind you, Im in and out
of Calcutta.

656
00:46:30,201 --> 00:46:32,240
But Im used to hearing
the city denounced.

657
00:46:32,506 --> 00:46:35,063
Why? Its certainly a
civilized city!

658
00:46:36,063 --> 00:46:38,583
You think so?
- Why not?

659
00:46:38,982 --> 00:46:41,783
Oh, the people are happier
in the streets.

660
00:46:42,063 --> 00:46:43,983
The high rises ascending
proudly...

661
00:46:44,059 --> 00:46:46,063
and in the midst of these,...

662
00:46:46,644 --> 00:46:51,583
even after 35 years.
I find men pulling rickshaws.

663
00:46:52,609 --> 00:46:55,063
How can you have a civilization
without these contradictions?

664
00:46:55,512 --> 00:46:58,583
You seem rather bitter
about civilization?

665
00:46:59,298 --> 00:47:00,863
What would you say
about a city like New York?

666
00:47:01,023 --> 00:47:02,903
Why, its colossal?

667
00:47:03,063 --> 00:47:05,063
Judging from what we
see in the movies,...

668
00:47:06,418 --> 00:47:12,402
family after family with
long faces squatting on it,...

669
00:47:13,083 --> 00:47:14,503
while a placard says,...

670
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:15,903
we are homeless.

671
00:47:19,831 --> 00:47:21,583
Are you coming straight
from New York?

672
00:47:22,854 --> 00:47:24,583
No. South America.
Brazil.

673
00:47:27,343 --> 00:47:29,983
Brazil. Great heavens!

674
00:47:32,063 --> 00:47:33,063
Whats the matter?

675
00:47:33,583 --> 00:47:36,343
Hes probably thinking of Pele.

676
00:47:37,369 --> 00:47:38,063
Pele?

677
00:47:39,191 --> 00:47:41,063
Youve been in Brazil and
you havent heard of Pele?

678
00:47:42,136 --> 00:47:43,863
Oh yes, footballer, isnt he?

679
00:47:43,939 --> 00:47:46,583
He scored a goal
with a back kick.

680
00:47:47,813 --> 00:47:50,063
Mr. Rakhit my knowledge
of football...

681
00:47:50,223 --> 00:47:52,013
is shockingly limited.
I only know about...

682
00:47:52,611 --> 00:47:55,226
two Bengal teams,
Mohan Bagan and East Bengal.

683
00:48:04,583 --> 00:48:07,063
Football and another thing,...

684
00:48:07,771 --> 00:48:09,983
something you must have
missed in the West.

685
00:48:10,737 --> 00:48:11,583
What?

686
00:48:12,352 --> 00:48:14,063
Something which is the
monopoly of Bengal.

687
00:48:14,583 --> 00:48:16,583
In fact you may call it
an invention of the Bengalis.

688
00:48:17,235 --> 00:48:17,983
The sweetmeat Rasogolla

689
00:48:20,854 --> 00:48:22,063
Talk sessions.

690
00:48:22,754 --> 00:48:29,063
There are simple sessions
on park benches and by the lakes...

691
00:48:29,463 --> 00:48:31,063
and in coffee houses.

692
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:34,063
That which Bengalis thrive on.

693
00:48:34,477 --> 00:48:36,583
Talk sessions made in Bengal.

694
00:48:41,751 --> 00:48:45,063
Dyou know 25 years ago,
in Greece,

695
00:48:46,074 --> 00:48:48,379
there were gymnasiums.

696
00:48:48,539 --> 00:48:51,169
Health gymnasiums, werent they?

697
00:48:51,583 --> 00:48:53,063
Not just looking macho...

698
00:48:53,885 --> 00:48:55,583
and juveniles dictum.

699
00:48:56,263 --> 00:48:58,063
We learnt it at school.

700
00:48:58,992 --> 00:49:01,583
Mens Sana in corpore sano.

701
00:49:06,175 --> 00:49:09,063
The Greek thus exercise both
the mind and the body.

702
00:49:09,797 --> 00:49:13,063
And there was a time when both
took place in the gymnasium.

703
00:49:14,352 --> 00:49:18,063
All these leading much of
Athens.

704
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:27,063
Plato, Socrates, Alicibiades
used to come.

705
00:49:27,802 --> 00:49:29,583
There were discussions...

706
00:49:30,903 --> 00:49:33,983
on Philosophy, Politics,
Mathematics...

707
00:49:34,143 --> 00:49:37,063
Art, Literature.

708
00:49:37,318 --> 00:49:39,583
They were known as Dialogue,
You can still read them.

709
00:49:40,951 --> 00:49:42,183
Now how would you describe
such an activity?

710
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:44,983
Why they sound very much
like our talk sessions?

711
00:49:48,931 --> 00:49:55,470
No gossip no backbiting,
no braggado.

712
00:49:57,452 --> 00:50:00,583
I dont wish to discuss the talk
sessions that the Bengalis indulge in.

713
00:50:01,385 --> 00:50:04,583
There must be some examples
of productive discourse.

714
00:50:06,492 --> 00:50:08,583
But what happens in most cases?

715
00:50:11,063 --> 00:50:13,063
At least what happens
in our time...

716
00:50:13,783 --> 00:50:15,448
and the norms have gone down
these days,...

717
00:50:17,109 --> 00:50:20,583
could only be described as
empty twaddle.

718
00:50:21,943 --> 00:50:24,063
Its discourse was at that
level here.

719
00:50:24,583 --> 00:50:26,143
Then Tegore would have
joined in them too.

720
00:50:27,447 --> 00:50:28,583
True enough.

721
00:50:29,263 --> 00:50:31,023
Tagore may get indulged in
talk sessions.

722
00:50:31,214 --> 00:50:33,543
Did he, Sudhin?

723
00:50:33,725 --> 00:50:35,583
Did Tagore ever indulge
in talk sessions?

724
00:50:36,932 --> 00:50:39,063
I havent really introduced
him to you.

725
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,583
He is a well known actor.

726
00:50:43,075 --> 00:50:45,774
Stage, Screen, TV, everything.

727
00:50:47,985 --> 00:50:50,063
Wont you call that civilized?

728
00:50:51,025 --> 00:50:53,063
Do you find material
for comedy here?

729
00:50:53,682 --> 00:50:56,063
Read nothing but tales of
woe in the paper today.

730
00:50:57,183 --> 00:50:59,869
I think theres room for satire.

731
00:51:00,419 --> 00:51:02,546
As long as our politicians
are there...

732
00:51:03,438 --> 00:51:09,583
- dont mean anything
as classy as Aris... - Aris?

733
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:12,583
Not.

734
00:51:14,398 --> 00:51:15,286
Sorry?

735
00:51:15,363 --> 00:51:16,223
Aristophanes?

736
00:51:16,583 --> 00:51:19,063
Yes. - Well, its not
quite at that level.

737
00:51:19,373 --> 00:51:22,063
More like skits.

738
00:51:24,583 --> 00:51:27,063
For instance, a certain
gentleman.

739
00:51:27,695 --> 00:51:29,063
Im giving you an example.

740
00:51:29,408 --> 00:51:30,983
A Bengali gentleman.

741
00:51:31,442 --> 00:51:33,743
Actually, someone
from East Bengal.

742
00:51:33,943 --> 00:51:35,396
Mind you, Im also East Bengali

743
00:51:35,863 --> 00:51:40,689
Really?
Well, so am I.

744
00:51:41,104 --> 00:51:43,703
So is my wife.

745
00:51:44,114 --> 00:51:44,903
And you?

746
00:51:45,162 --> 00:51:46,063
East.

747
00:51:46,729 --> 00:51:47,903
And you Sudhin?

748
00:51:48,722 --> 00:51:49,988
West with a vengeance.

749
00:51:50,383 --> 00:51:51,903
Sorry. You dont count.

750
00:51:52,063 --> 00:51:53,278
Anyway, this gentleman...

751
00:51:53,355 --> 00:51:55,063
Stand up, stand up.

752
00:51:55,893 --> 00:51:57,503
Very well.

753
00:51:59,558 --> 00:52:03,179
This gentleman has gone
to the Writers Building...

754
00:52:03,256 --> 00:52:05,383
to see the Chief Minister

755
00:52:05,847 --> 00:52:09,064
He feels that on
certain occasions,...

756
00:52:09,489 --> 00:52:12,383
English works are better
than Bengali.

757
00:52:13,309 --> 00:52:15,904
Well, there he is.
In front of the lift...

758
00:52:16,131 --> 00:52:17,138
the police stops him.

759
00:52:17,304 --> 00:52:18,747
The police asked
where do you want to go?

760
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:21,383
The man said Ive come
to see C.M.

761
00:52:22,103 --> 00:52:25,005
CCM? You mean
CPM? (Communist Party Marxist).

762
00:52:33,554 --> 00:52:34,903
Do you have an appointment?

763
00:52:35,103 --> 00:52:39,739
Yes, right now.
4 cm - I mean, pm.

764
00:52:43,773 --> 00:52:44,903
Why sorry?

765
00:52:46,654 --> 00:52:48,382
Whats there to be sorry about?

766
00:52:53,218 --> 00:52:56,383
Left so soon?
- Right.

767
00:53:01,093 --> 00:53:04,383
Well. Mr. Rakhit, can I
ask you something now?

768
00:53:04,546 --> 00:53:07,788
Certainly.
- How do you find me?

769
00:53:13,107 --> 00:53:15,705
Youve come to see me,
havent you?

770
00:53:17,591 --> 00:53:20,441
Whats the use of a new paper
where theres a telephone?

771
00:53:23,318 --> 00:53:25,344
It must be very hard to keep it
to yourself. Isnt that so, Anila?

772
00:53:27,595 --> 00:53:28,970
Its full of the stuff of drama.

773
00:53:30,065 --> 00:53:34,383
Suspense, suspicion, conflict...

774
00:53:38,848 --> 00:53:40,463
I hope you dont mind
my saying so, Mr. Rakhit.

775
00:53:40,595 --> 00:53:46,383
No, no, in fact, it wont be
easy to keep up the pretence.

776
00:53:47,137 --> 00:53:50,303
Now that it is no longer
necessary, I feel...

777
00:53:50,637 --> 00:53:52,995
much relieved, is that it?

778
00:54:38,326 --> 00:54:39,463
Whats the matter?

779
00:54:45,268 --> 00:54:48,143
I cant get it out of my mind.
- What?

780
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:49,903
Ranjans expressions.

781
00:54:51,128 --> 00:54:53,623
Ive never seen him
deflated like that.

782
00:54:57,591 --> 00:55:02,623
I must say Im beginning
to like your uncle.

783
00:55:03,568 --> 00:55:05,228
Theres no doubt hes
a learned man.

784
00:55:05,305 --> 00:55:07,128
One can see he was
a good student.

785
00:55:09,383 --> 00:55:13,783
What I like most about him
is his sense of humour.

786
00:55:14,462 --> 00:55:17,543
He knows how to laugh and
how to make people laugh.

787
00:55:21,623 --> 00:55:25,623
We know next to nothing
about the man.

788
00:55:27,543 --> 00:55:30,143
What hes been doing
all these years?

789
00:55:31,143 --> 00:55:33,623
Where hes been? Why?

790
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:35,143
Nothing.

791
00:55:41,889 --> 00:55:42,965
Very surprising.

792
00:55:46,499 --> 00:55:51,623
Listen, your uncle may be
an early riser.

793
00:55:52,623 --> 00:55:55,870
Im not going to stir
before nine.

794
00:56:12,055 --> 00:56:13,140
Whats the matter?

795
00:56:13,850 --> 00:56:15,060
Whats in your mind?

796
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:40,660
Will you please tell me
whats the matter?

797
00:56:42,765 --> 00:56:46,340
Its wrong to hide anything
from your husband at bed time.

798
00:56:46,832 --> 00:56:48,220
Do you know that?

799
00:56:49,292 --> 00:56:51,140
This is not marriage counsel.

800
00:56:51,846 --> 00:56:53,660
I made it up.

801
00:56:54,876 --> 00:56:56,660
Now come on, out with it.

802
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:58,060
Come on.

803
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:04,140
Why did it come to my mind
Why? Why? Why?

804
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:05,980
What came to your mind?

805
00:57:08,845 --> 00:57:10,020
What?

806
00:57:11,367 --> 00:57:13,059
If a man disappears,...

807
00:57:13,557 --> 00:57:18,420
how much time is given
before hes taken for dead?

808
00:57:19,233 --> 00:57:20,660
7 years.

809
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:25,140
Uncle left in 55.

810
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:29,660
He sent that card to
Mr. Sital till 68.

811
00:57:33,412 --> 00:57:35,660
Grandpa died in 70.

812
00:57:38,175 --> 00:57:40,140
He had made a will.

813
00:57:41,683 --> 00:57:44,660
My mother got a share.
So did my elder uncle.

814
00:57:45,918 --> 00:57:48,660
Grandpa was very fond of
my younger uncle.

815
00:57:49,467 --> 00:57:51,660
Now I see.

816
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:55,140
This surely calls for applause!

817
00:58:01,516 --> 00:58:04,660
Your grandpa must have
provided in his will...

818
00:58:04,736 --> 00:58:08,604
for your younger uncle.
Isnt that what you believe?

819
00:58:08,681 --> 00:58:11,140
Then if he did, how would
uncle know?

820
00:58:11,531 --> 00:58:14,140
We can think of it later.

821
00:58:15,787 --> 00:58:19,860
We have to find out now whether
he did make such provision.

822
00:58:20,561 --> 00:58:21,980
How will you find out?

823
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:23,660
Isnt there anyone, wholl know?

824
00:58:24,504 --> 00:58:28,820
I dont know.
I cant think of anything else.

825
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:29,900
Listen.

826
00:58:30,254 --> 00:58:34,136
That lawyer friend of your grandpas.
He came to our wedding.

827
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:37,980
A bit deaf and stinking rich.

828
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:40,290
Yet he gave us a book of
verse as a present.

829
00:58:40,456 --> 00:58:42,340
Remember what a laugh
we had over it?

830
00:58:43,217 --> 00:58:45,140
Tridib Mukherji?
- Right!

831
00:58:45,811 --> 00:58:47,660
He was 70 or 80 at that time.

832
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:49,980
What makes you think
hes still alive?

833
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:51,613
He may be.

834
00:58:51,690 --> 00:58:53,860
And if he is,
hed certainly know.

835
00:58:55,016 --> 00:58:56,822
Why did I have to think of it?

836
00:58:56,988 --> 00:58:58,860
Why, why?

837
00:58:59,594 --> 00:59:02,660
Are you regretting it?
- Yes, I am. Very much so.

838
00:59:03,589 --> 00:59:06,132
I have no doubt in my mind
any more that he is my uncle...

839
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:08,140
and the only reason
hes come is to see me.

840
00:59:09,131 --> 00:59:11,140
There cant be any other reason.

841
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:13,282
You refer to him as your uncle.

842
00:59:13,359 --> 00:59:15,660
But have you ever
addressed him as uncle?

843
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:17,340
I havent heard you doing so.

844
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:19,946
Do you know, why I havent?
Its because of you.

845
00:59:20,023 --> 00:59:22,660
You put such doubts
in to my mind.

846
00:59:23,402 --> 00:59:25,660
I want so much
to call him uncle.

847
00:59:27,660 --> 00:59:28,726
I try to so hard.

848
00:59:28,803 --> 00:59:31,140
The word comes to the tip
of my tongue, but...

849
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:32,820
good thing it hasnt come out.

850
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:43,660
Listen, you must try
to be strong now.

851
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:48,660
The pill may prove bitter.
And you may have to swallow it.

852
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:50,660
You must be ready for that.

853
00:59:51,922 --> 00:59:54,100
Youre saying he is here
because of ties of blood.

854
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:57,140
What if I say hes come
to fill his pockets?

855
00:59:58,377 --> 01:00:01,660
All these travels cost
a lot these days.

856
01:00:02,862 --> 01:00:04,823
Im convinced hes come
to claim his share.

857
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,941
Thats the only reason.

858
01:00:07,017 --> 01:00:11,060
How can you be so mean?
So ruthless?

859
01:00:14,879 --> 01:00:16,660
Who thought of it first?

860
01:00:17,059 --> 01:00:20,140
This is what put it into
my head - crime fiction-

861
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:22,660
The thought of a will
wouldnt have struck me at all.

862
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:40,140
First, we must make sure that
your uncle had a share. Right?

863
01:00:41,801 --> 01:00:44,100
We must verify that.

864
01:00:45,401 --> 01:00:48,140
Weve to find out the truth,
however bitter it may be.

865
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:50,331
TC, isnt it?

866
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:55,660
Are you out of my mind?
Phoning him at this hour?

867
01:00:56,340 --> 01:00:59,140
Tell me, TC or TR?

868
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:02,140
Address?

869
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:06,860
Ballygunge Circular Road.
I dont know the number.

870
01:01:18,878 --> 01:01:20,660
He hasnt come for his share.

871
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:25,140
I have no doubt about
this any more.

872
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:30,820
Hes come only to...

873
01:01:33,773 --> 01:01:35,660
Is this
Mr. Mukherrjis bungalow?

874
01:01:37,374 --> 01:01:40,140
The lawyer, Mr. Mukherji?

875
01:01:42,394 --> 01:01:43,660
I see.

876
01:01:44,168 --> 01:01:47,660
But hes alive, isnt he?

877
01:01:49,939 --> 01:01:52,140
I see, I see.

878
01:01:53,095 --> 01:01:55,533
All right.

879
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:04,140
What I want to know is...

880
01:02:04,217 --> 01:02:07,540
who were Mr. Mitras
warishan (heirs)?

881
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:10,140
Who went to Washington?

882
01:02:11,028 --> 01:02:13,540
Warishan - heirs!

883
01:02:14,090 --> 01:02:15,620
Oh, air.

884
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:20,140
- H-E-I-R-S -

885
01:02:21,064 --> 01:02:23,580
I see, heirs (Warishan).

886
01:02:23,888 --> 01:02:26,140
Yes, Mr. Mitras heirs.

887
01:02:27,271 --> 01:02:30,140
Were his three children.

888
01:02:31,537 --> 01:02:34,140
Did he provide for
all 3 in his will?

889
01:02:35,272 --> 01:02:36,380
Bromide?

890
01:02:41,218 --> 01:02:42,848
In Mr. Mitras will.

891
01:02:43,211 --> 01:02:46,958
Yes, yes. The elder son
got his share.

892
01:02:47,778 --> 01:02:51,620
The daughter Nila got hers.
Sizeable amount.

893
01:02:52,282 --> 01:02:56,140
You see, he was the
leading ENT specialist then.

894
01:02:58,841 --> 01:03:02,140
I met him in his chamber.

895
01:03:03,968 --> 01:03:06,140
Id been to Delhi.

896
01:03:08,150 --> 01:03:09,620
It was before the time of jets.

897
01:03:11,620 --> 01:03:13,900
At the time of landing,...

898
01:03:15,270 --> 01:03:21,342
my ears got blocked.
They refused to open.

899
01:03:23,646 --> 01:03:25,620
I came back to Calcutta...

900
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:28,900
to meet Mr. Mitra.

901
01:03:30,058 --> 01:03:31,620
He was on the rise then.

902
01:03:35,444 --> 01:03:37,620
He inserted a tube
into the nostrils.

903
01:03:38,941 --> 01:03:40,620
Blew air through it.

904
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:46,940
His youngest son
Mr. Mitra.

905
01:03:47,017 --> 01:03:48,140
Yes, Monu.

906
01:03:49,620 --> 01:03:53,140
Manmohan.
- Did he have a share too?

907
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:55,140
Certainly.

908
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:57,140
But he was missing at the time.

909
01:03:59,024 --> 01:04:01,951
All that we knew was that...

910
01:04:03,020 --> 01:04:05,140
he was still alive.

911
01:04:06,540 --> 01:04:09,848
Dyou know that hes come back?

912
01:04:11,406 --> 01:04:13,140
No, I dont.

913
01:04:14,363 --> 01:04:17,780
Will he get his share now?
- What?

914
01:04:23,361 --> 01:04:26,620
Will he get his share if
he comes back?

915
01:04:27,606 --> 01:04:29,540
Why not?

916
01:04:30,140 --> 01:04:33,540
Money is not camphor
that it will evaporate.

917
01:04:34,745 --> 01:04:36,580
Hell get it if he
stakes his claims.

918
01:04:36,740 --> 01:04:41,576
Of course, hell have to
prove his identity.

919
01:04:43,651 --> 01:04:46,140
Will a passport do?

920
01:04:46,817 --> 01:04:47,620
Oh yes.

921
01:04:50,637 --> 01:04:54,620
Where is the money now?
With whom?

922
01:04:56,900 --> 01:05:00,362
With the executor Mitra
has appointed.

923
01:05:00,620 --> 01:05:04,305
Its in the Bank in his account.

924
01:05:06,143 --> 01:05:09,620
Is he likely to be a
friend of Mohini?

925
01:05:10,969 --> 01:05:15,140
Why French? More likely
to be a Bengali.

926
01:05:16,106 --> 01:05:18,409
When Mitra died,...

927
01:05:19,541 --> 01:05:23,140
I was away in Singapore,
at my son-in-laws.

928
01:05:38,802 --> 01:05:39,980
What is that?

929
01:05:42,155 --> 01:05:44,895
Savage Music.
- How did you come by it?

930
01:05:46,068 --> 01:05:47,140
Magic!

931
01:05:49,378 --> 01:05:51,620
I have found out.
- What?

932
01:05:52,170 --> 01:05:54,543
Who you are?
- Well, who am I?

933
01:05:54,889 --> 01:05:56,140
My great uncle.

934
01:05:57,099 --> 01:05:59,140
Real or fake?
- Real.

935
01:06:00,005 --> 01:06:02,140
How did you know?
The others dont.

936
01:06:05,651 --> 01:06:06,420
Magic.

937
01:06:09,740 --> 01:06:11,740
So Ill call you
great uncle from now?

938
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:14,300
And more than a great uncle.
- What are you?

939
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:16,922
Hopping great uncle
- Hopping great uncle?

940
01:06:17,088 --> 01:06:20,660
Yes, Im always ready to
go hopping.

941
01:06:21,187 --> 01:06:22,740
All my life Ive been hopping
from place to place.

942
01:06:23,191 --> 01:06:25,300
Ill rest here a few days
and then go hopping again.

943
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:27,980
Do you like it here?

944
01:06:28,878 --> 01:06:31,098
Ill stay as long as I do.

945
01:06:31,721 --> 01:06:33,070
Then youll go hopping again?

946
01:06:34,645 --> 01:06:38,885
Wait, Ill teach you a new word.
Very funny word.

947
01:06:40,014 --> 01:06:41,885
Kupa-munduk.

948
01:06:43,325 --> 01:06:45,182
Kupa-munduk?

949
01:06:46,220 --> 01:06:50,205
Kupa is a well and munduk
is a frog.

950
01:06:50,885 --> 01:06:52,458
A frog in the well?

951
01:06:52,535 --> 01:06:55,716
Yes, just this,
how terrible it is!

952
01:06:55,893 --> 01:06:59,204
Dark, Dank, Smelly, Slimy...

953
01:06:59,370 --> 01:07:01,525
and yet the frog never
moves from there.

954
01:07:01,885 --> 01:07:04,030
There are such frogs
among people also.

955
01:07:04,310 --> 01:07:07,885
They are called stay at homes.
Im not one of them.

956
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:09,965
Thats why, I am on the move
so much of the time.

957
01:07:10,247 --> 01:07:12,885
What if I go out too?
- You must.

958
01:07:12,962 --> 01:07:15,405
If you dont, how can
you eat armadillo meat.

959
01:07:15,603 --> 01:07:16,965
What meat?

960
01:07:17,264 --> 01:07:20,085
Meat of the ant eater armadillo.

961
01:07:20,272 --> 01:07:21,746
Who eats such meat?

962
01:07:23,407 --> 01:07:27,184
If I tell you everything Ill
run out of stock of stories.

963
01:07:27,361 --> 01:07:28,525
Wait.

964
01:07:28,959 --> 01:07:31,085
And then youll have
your reward.

965
01:07:40,905 --> 01:07:46,365
God! Both my pharynx and
larynx are gone.

966
01:07:47,309 --> 01:07:51,085
A hearing aid that serves
no function at all.

967
01:07:51,657 --> 01:07:52,885
Share?

968
01:07:54,621 --> 01:07:57,885
He believes your uncle
did have a share.

969
01:07:59,104 --> 01:08:03,285
But he was away in
Singapore at the time...

970
01:08:03,629 --> 01:08:05,405
of your grandpas death,...

971
01:08:06,556 --> 01:08:11,405
in case your grandpa...

972
01:08:11,525 --> 01:08:15,205
thinking his youngest son
wouldnt return,...

973
01:08:15,626 --> 01:08:17,405
has changed his will
at the last moment.

974
01:08:18,210 --> 01:08:21,885
Mr. Mukherji was in
no position to know.

975
01:08:23,119 --> 01:08:24,365
That must have been it.

976
01:08:25,807 --> 01:08:27,405
It didnt strike me
that way at all.

977
01:08:28,474 --> 01:08:30,696
If uncle had a share,...

978
01:08:30,996 --> 01:08:32,645
Mr. Sital would
certainly have known...

979
01:08:32,885 --> 01:08:34,661
and informed uncle...

980
01:08:34,737 --> 01:08:38,490
and uncle wouldnt
hide the good news.

981
01:08:51,017 --> 01:08:51,885
Why not?

982
01:08:55,791 --> 01:08:58,365
A man whose hand is tied,...

983
01:08:58,885 --> 01:09:01,707
is also likely to
have a closed mind.

984
01:09:02,049 --> 01:09:03,405
Tight fisted.

985
01:09:03,824 --> 01:09:07,405
A man who comes to see his
niece after 35 years...

986
01:09:07,525 --> 01:09:08,816
empty handed,...

987
01:09:09,242 --> 01:09:11,045
he is bound to be tight fisted.

988
01:09:11,421 --> 01:09:12,963
Anyway, well surely know...

989
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:16,365
what kind of a man he is
after tonights grilling.

990
01:09:27,944 --> 01:09:29,405
What are you doing?

991
01:09:36,063 --> 01:09:38,365
Whatever else uncle
may be hes no thief.

992
01:09:45,046 --> 01:09:45,801
Beautiful!

993
01:09:48,815 --> 01:09:50,765
Was this here yesterday?

994
01:09:52,005 --> 01:09:54,365
No, it wasnt.

995
01:09:55,515 --> 01:09:56,525
Pal bronze.

996
01:09:58,322 --> 01:09:59,525
Rajput miniatures.

997
01:10:01,118 --> 01:10:02,045
Ivory.

998
01:10:03,261 --> 01:10:05,045
Is it your collection, Sudhin?

999
01:10:05,445 --> 01:10:07,525
No, my fathers.

1000
01:10:08,998 --> 01:10:10,685
I noticed this instrument
yesterday.

1001
01:10:10,761 --> 01:10:13,845
Is that a Sitar or a Tanpura?
- Tanpura.

1002
01:10:13,922 --> 01:10:17,045
So you sing, do you?
- Occasionally.

1003
01:10:17,317 --> 01:10:22,656
She not only sings
but dances too.

1004
01:10:22,872 --> 01:10:24,508
A dance recital would be
too tall an order.

1005
01:10:24,707 --> 01:10:26,534
But it would be nice, if you
could give us a song.

1006
01:10:26,816 --> 01:10:28,253
What about it, dear?

1007
01:10:28,329 --> 01:10:30,725
Havent heard a Bengali song
ever since I left home.

1008
01:10:30,885 --> 01:10:32,653
Ill sing when youve
finished your tea.

1009
01:10:32,837 --> 01:10:34,165
Very well.

1010
01:10:36,847 --> 01:10:38,045
Where is Bablu?

1011
01:10:38,308 --> 01:10:42,525
Hes gone to his friends house.
Where the Durga festival is on.

1012
01:10:42,692 --> 01:10:46,045
By the way, if you wish to smoke,
please go ahead.

1013
01:10:46,525 --> 01:10:48,099
Some people dont smoke
in the presence of elders.

1014
01:10:48,258 --> 01:10:52,045
I dont believe in such
show of respect.

1015
01:10:55,412 --> 01:10:58,445
Is it the Durga Festival that
has brought you at this time?

1016
01:10:58,521 --> 01:11:00,685
I didnt even know the
festival season was on.

1017
01:11:02,864 --> 01:11:05,485
Do you know how many times
the Goddess Durga...

1018
01:11:07,247 --> 01:11:10,045
slew the Buffalo Demon?
- I thought only once.

1019
01:11:13,525 --> 01:11:16,525
Dyou know Ganesh has the
head of an elephant?

1020
01:11:16,945 --> 01:11:19,045
I did, but Ive forgotten.

1021
01:11:19,525 --> 01:11:23,666
I heard all the mythologies
from my grandma.

1022
01:11:24,230 --> 01:11:25,205
I still remember them.

1023
01:11:25,499 --> 01:11:27,405
How do you think our
country is shaping?

1024
01:11:27,824 --> 01:11:29,045
Dyou read the papers?

1025
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:34,525
Caste and religion, which
create serious problems.

1026
01:11:35,084 --> 01:11:36,765
The newspapers bear
testimony to that.

1027
01:11:40,325 --> 01:11:42,485
Do you believe in Dharma?

1028
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:45,485
By Dharma you mean
religion I suppose.

1029
01:11:45,671 --> 01:11:48,525
But in our scriptures, Dharma
means something quite different.

1030
01:11:49,045 --> 01:11:51,045
I mean religion.

1031
01:11:52,525 --> 01:11:54,525
Ill answer your question later.

1032
01:11:54,685 --> 01:11:57,525
Have you finished your tea?
- Yes.

1033
01:11:57,685 --> 01:11:59,315
Ready, dear?
- Yes.

1034
01:11:59,461 --> 01:12:01,045
Silence please.

1035
01:12:04,384 --> 01:12:09,848
Who plays the Veena..

1036
01:12:10,769 --> 01:12:18,769
Who plays the Veena
in such dulcet tones?

1037
01:12:20,848 --> 01:12:25,356
Who plays the Veena..

1038
01:12:25,805 --> 01:12:32,713
Showering melody upon
my secluded life.

1039
01:12:32,937 --> 01:12:40,937
Who plays the Veena
in such dulcet tones?

1040
01:12:43,466 --> 01:12:48,397
Who plays the Veena..

1041
01:12:49,834 --> 01:12:56,443
My heart opens up like
the morning lotus.

1042
01:12:56,634 --> 01:13:03,119
My heart opens up like
the morning lotus.

1043
01:13:03,525 --> 01:13:10,234
And wait for a pair of
damp feet to approach me.

1044
01:13:10,311 --> 01:13:18,311
Who plays the Veena
in such dulcet tones?

1045
01:13:21,135 --> 01:13:26,424
Who plays the Veena..

1046
01:13:27,620 --> 01:13:33,928
Grace and beauty awakens...

1047
01:13:34,318 --> 01:13:40,350
and my heart
fills with joy.

1048
01:13:40,950 --> 01:13:47,045
Grace and beauty awakens...

1049
01:13:47,696 --> 01:13:53,525
and my heart
fills with joy.

1050
01:13:54,636 --> 01:13:57,669
A fresh breeze flows...

1051
01:13:57,896 --> 01:14:01,045
and stirs everything
to a new life.

1052
01:14:01,122 --> 01:14:04,285
A fresh breeze flows...

1053
01:14:04,362 --> 01:14:07,512
and stirs everything
to a new life.

1054
01:14:07,853 --> 01:14:15,045
Reaching the depth
of my being,...

1055
01:14:16,026 --> 01:14:24,026
who plays the Veena
in such dulcet tones?

1056
01:14:25,659 --> 01:14:30,410
Who plays the Veena..

1057
01:14:32,274 --> 01:14:39,525
My heart has known pain.
Both the happiness and sorrow.

1058
01:14:39,685 --> 01:14:47,685
But I have had no song
to express it.

1059
01:14:48,296 --> 01:14:55,560
My heart has known pain.
Both the happiness and sorrow.

1060
01:14:55,901 --> 01:15:03,901
But I have had no song
to express it.

1061
01:15:04,592 --> 01:15:10,965
And all my desire
comes out into the open.

1062
01:15:11,257 --> 01:15:17,525
And all my desire
comes out into the open.

1063
01:15:17,906 --> 01:15:25,235
And the river and forest
trembles in sympathy.

1064
01:15:26,046 --> 01:15:34,046
Who plays the Veena
in such dulcet tones?

1065
01:15:35,516 --> 01:15:40,349
Who plays the Veena..

1066
01:15:48,830 --> 01:15:49,525
Lovely!

1067
01:15:51,245 --> 01:15:52,605
Reminds me of my sister.

1068
01:16:03,565 --> 01:16:05,245
What was the question?

1069
01:16:05,725 --> 01:16:09,245
Whether you believe
in religion or not?

1070
01:16:09,700 --> 01:16:12,445
Oh yes, religion.

1071
01:16:18,485 --> 01:16:23,485
Mr. Sen Gupta. I happen to be
a bit unorthodox in my views.

1072
01:16:24,392 --> 01:16:26,045
Thats all right.

1073
01:16:27,555 --> 01:16:33,205
I dont believe in something which
creates barriers between people.

1074
01:16:34,171 --> 01:16:38,925
Religion does that.
Particularly organised religion.

1075
01:16:39,912 --> 01:16:43,245
For the same reason,
I dont believe in caste.

1076
01:16:47,420 --> 01:16:48,845
What about God?

1077
01:16:56,144 --> 01:17:04,144
Gives light to the blind,
life to the dying.

1078
01:17:14,372 --> 01:17:17,925
Who will give light?

1079
01:17:19,270 --> 01:17:20,925
Who will give life?

1080
01:17:23,485 --> 01:17:28,485
The trouble is, it is
extremely difficult...

1081
01:17:28,968 --> 01:17:33,492
..to believe in a
benevolent God these days.

1082
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:41,925
The daily papers alone make us
question that belief.

1083
01:17:42,427 --> 01:17:43,925
What can you do?

1084
01:17:48,314 --> 01:17:50,925
I am of the same
opinion as you are.

1085
01:17:51,672 --> 01:17:55,485
But, what about science?

1086
01:17:56,131 --> 01:17:59,485
Voyager has sent
pictures of Neptune.

1087
01:17:59,685 --> 01:18:01,485
What do you think of that?

1088
01:18:02,016 --> 01:18:05,146
For a change,
lets hear what you think.

1089
01:18:06,281 --> 01:18:07,546
Nothing special.

1090
01:18:07,623 --> 01:18:11,925
Mine is the opinion of
an average educated person.

1091
01:18:12,152 --> 01:18:13,546
And what is that?

1092
01:18:13,623 --> 01:18:16,485
The advance in technology
has been phenomenal.

1093
01:18:16,562 --> 01:18:20,341
Something we couldnt
dream of a few years back.

1094
01:18:26,666 --> 01:18:28,605
Now look at something else.

1095
01:18:32,016 --> 01:18:34,594
Millions of people mostly
young are injecting...

1096
01:18:34,671 --> 01:18:37,060
the deadliest of drugs...

1097
01:18:37,416 --> 01:18:39,314
into their system by means
of hypodermic needles...

1098
01:18:39,391 --> 01:18:43,925
and signing their
death warrants.

1099
01:18:45,266 --> 01:18:48,245
What technology is there to put
a stop to this, Mr. Sen Gupta?

1100
01:18:51,914 --> 01:18:55,887
Youve been living in the
West, havent you?

1101
01:18:56,179 --> 01:18:57,525
Yes.

1102
01:18:58,692 --> 01:19:01,886
Why? The West is ruled
by technology.

1103
01:19:02,114 --> 01:19:04,254
If it is something
so unsavory to you,...

1104
01:19:04,330 --> 01:19:06,103
why dont you go and
stay with the jungle folk?

1105
01:19:06,179 --> 01:19:08,291
But that is Clairvoyance.

1106
01:19:08,368 --> 01:19:10,605
It certainly doesnt come
under the purview of science.

1107
01:19:13,605 --> 01:19:18,525
You mean, you have actually
lived with these jungle folks?

1108
01:19:21,784 --> 01:19:26,125
After leaving home, I spent 5 years
in the country in tribal areas.

1109
01:19:26,843 --> 01:19:28,448
Starting with the Santhals,...

1110
01:19:28,525 --> 01:19:32,885
I studied the Kols,
Bhils, Nagas, Mundas...

1111
01:19:33,405 --> 01:19:36,248
Murias, Marias, Oraons, Todas...

1112
01:19:36,325 --> 01:19:37,765
Its an endless list...

1113
01:19:37,842 --> 01:19:41,125
You actually spent time
with these tribals?

1114
01:19:41,605 --> 01:19:44,843
Have you ever tasted rat-meat?

1115
01:19:45,524 --> 01:19:48,125
Snake meat?
Bat meat?

1116
01:19:48,394 --> 01:19:52,076
I told you I was omnivorous.
Im not using a figure of speech.

1117
01:19:52,153 --> 01:19:53,605
Its plain truth.

1118
01:19:55,838 --> 01:20:03,605
It doesnt seem likely that in
these 5 years you earned anything.

1119
01:20:04,061 --> 01:20:07,125
On the contrary, I reached
the end of my resources.

1120
01:20:09,444 --> 01:20:12,245
You must be wondering where
the resources came from.

1121
01:20:12,849 --> 01:20:17,147
I dont imagine your father
sponsored your disappearance.

1122
01:20:22,450 --> 01:20:24,125
Ill tell you what happened.

1123
01:20:25,742 --> 01:20:28,805
My grandmother,
the late Giribala Dasi,...

1124
01:20:30,218 --> 01:20:32,125
whom I mentioned
a little while ago,...

1125
01:20:32,359 --> 01:20:34,565
was extremely fond of me.

1126
01:20:34,725 --> 01:20:37,125
Went to the length
of spoiling me.

1127
01:20:37,726 --> 01:20:40,125
I stood first in my
matriculation exam,...

1128
01:20:40,202 --> 01:20:42,104
as well as in my
intermediate exam.

1129
01:20:42,181 --> 01:20:44,485
When I got first class
in B.A.,...

1130
01:20:44,699 --> 01:20:48,137
my grandma made me a gift
of a large sum of money,...

1131
01:20:48,542 --> 01:20:52,970
Saying, youve brought
great honour to our family.

1132
01:20:53,047 --> 01:20:55,645
May God bless you.

1133
01:20:57,104 --> 01:21:01,165
3000 rupees was no joke
in those days.

1134
01:21:01,824 --> 01:21:04,727
So, I left home
with my own resources.

1135
01:21:04,937 --> 01:21:07,885
I didnt have to beg,
borrow or steal.

1136
01:21:09,125 --> 01:21:10,125
I get it.

1137
01:21:10,970 --> 01:21:14,765
But you said you had
run out of your resources.

1138
01:21:15,494 --> 01:21:18,605
Here a question naturally
arises.

1139
01:21:19,841 --> 01:21:21,765
Who paid for your trip abroad...

1140
01:21:29,603 --> 01:21:32,605
and then,
after you arrived in London?

1141
01:21:33,125 --> 01:21:35,605
And the 5 years not
just in London,...

1142
01:21:35,912 --> 01:21:37,325
but in various cities in Europe.

1143
01:21:37,614 --> 01:21:39,525
What did you do there?

1144
01:21:40,177 --> 01:21:42,125
I struggled to make
both ends meet.

1145
01:21:43,177 --> 01:21:46,125
Struggle - a favourite
word with the Bengalis.

1146
01:21:46,890 --> 01:21:49,125
But I dont call it struggle.

1147
01:21:49,825 --> 01:21:53,525
I think of it as nutrition for
the brain and for the muscle...

1148
01:21:55,079 --> 01:21:58,365
and as the first step in
getting to know your fellow beings.

1149
01:21:59,786 --> 01:22:02,692
When did you return
to the jungles?

1150
01:22:03,327 --> 01:22:05,573
All these experiences,
it seems to me,...

1151
01:22:05,649 --> 01:22:07,634
took place in civilized cities.

1152
01:22:24,875 --> 01:22:31,751
Have patience, dear beloved.

1153
01:22:32,010 --> 01:22:35,707
I may go to Mathura soon.

1154
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:45,994
My autobiography wont get you
much nearer the truth my friend.

1155
01:22:47,552 --> 01:22:50,186
Youre trying to reach
the core of the person...

1156
01:22:50,263 --> 01:22:52,125
by peeling the layers
of the onion, arent you?

1157
01:22:53,286 --> 01:22:55,125
The task is not an easy one.

1158
01:22:56,243 --> 01:22:59,125
Even so, for the sake of
the record, let me tell you...

1159
01:22:59,838 --> 01:23:02,605
and by the time I had started
writing for various journals,...

1160
01:23:03,625 --> 01:23:05,485
as a result
I had a bank balance,...

1161
01:23:06,557 --> 01:23:08,925
which again led me to my
second phase of scholarship.

1162
01:23:09,345 --> 01:23:11,125
A degree in anthropology...

1163
01:23:13,185 --> 01:23:14,528
and then on to
the United States.

1164
01:23:15,262 --> 01:23:17,485
United States?
- United States of America.

1165
01:23:18,037 --> 01:23:20,606
Reason?
- Indians.

1166
01:23:20,865 --> 01:23:24,471
Oh, I see - American Indians.

1167
01:23:26,158 --> 01:23:27,645
A cabin boy again?

1168
01:23:28,182 --> 01:23:30,525
No, Sir.
Dont mind.

1169
01:23:30,893 --> 01:23:34,965
I may sound like I am beating
my own drum.

1170
01:23:35,342 --> 01:23:38,645
But there too I stood
first in the examination.

1171
01:23:39,779 --> 01:23:41,805
As a result, I didnt
have to struggle anymore.

1172
01:23:41,965 --> 01:23:46,615
A well known Anthropological Society
paid for my travels in the USA...

1173
01:23:47,704 --> 01:23:48,755
on condition that...

1174
01:23:48,832 --> 01:23:51,965
I regularly send them written
accounts of my experiments...

1175
01:23:52,388 --> 01:23:53,965
along with photographs.

1176
01:23:54,125 --> 01:23:55,965
I fulfilled the condition.

1177
01:23:56,240 --> 01:23:58,125
In North and South Americas,...

1178
01:23:58,420 --> 01:24:02,525
I spent time studying
43 different tribes.

1179
01:24:03,544 --> 01:24:06,965
It was this experience,
which really opened my eyes.

1180
01:24:07,748 --> 01:24:08,798
Very well.

1181
01:24:13,003 --> 01:24:14,445
You sit down.

1182
01:24:14,565 --> 01:24:16,525
Youre beginning
to sound hoarse.

1183
01:24:16,645 --> 01:24:17,645
As you wish.

1184
01:24:19,525 --> 01:24:21,245
You listen while I talk.

1185
01:24:21,538 --> 01:24:22,765
Correct me if I am wrong.

1186
01:24:25,525 --> 01:24:27,885
The upshot is...

1187
01:24:28,585 --> 01:24:32,426
all these experiences
has led you to believe...

1188
01:24:32,602 --> 01:24:35,965
that the so called urban
civilization is an eye wash.

1189
01:24:36,380 --> 01:24:39,405
Real civilization is to be
found among the tribals.

1190
01:24:39,725 --> 01:24:43,525
Let me tell you that although
I am city born and bred,...

1191
01:24:43,769 --> 01:24:45,805
I am not ignorant
about tribal life.

1192
01:24:45,965 --> 01:24:48,125
I have read quite
a few books on the subject.

1193
01:24:48,564 --> 01:24:52,645
I know they have their own
language, their own religion,...

1194
01:24:52,870 --> 01:24:56,585
their art, their culture,
their music, etc., etc.,

1195
01:25:03,923 --> 01:25:04,965
What is etc. etc.?

1196
01:25:05,965 --> 01:25:08,965
You must tell these people what
youre hiding behind that word

1197
01:25:09,125 --> 01:25:10,965
Otherwise how will they know me?

1198
01:25:11,125 --> 01:25:13,245
How will they know about
tribal civilization?

1199
01:25:13,525 --> 01:25:15,525
You tell me what
I have left out!

1200
01:25:15,645 --> 01:25:18,733
My good man, the main things!

1201
01:25:19,525 --> 01:25:22,064
Science, technology

1202
01:25:22,677 --> 01:25:26,205
Youre thinking only of
Neptune and voyager

1203
01:25:26,714 --> 01:25:29,205
Just turn your thoughts to Man

1204
01:25:29,807 --> 01:25:33,242
In the most primitive
barbaric state...

1205
01:25:34,010 --> 01:25:39,323
try to figure out how they
could learn hunting, pottery...

1206
01:25:39,884 --> 01:25:43,216
and everything needed to
lead a decent human existence

1207
01:25:43,704 --> 01:25:45,725
Then theres architecture

1208
01:25:46,610 --> 01:25:49,325
Even a simple mud hut shows
evidence of architecture

1209
01:25:49,605 --> 01:25:52,525
Do you know the igloo?
The dwelling of the Eskimos?

1210
01:25:53,408 --> 01:25:55,525
Do you know that two kinds of
ice are used to build it?

1211
01:25:56,344 --> 01:26:00,277
One is opaque, which
is used in the roofing.

1212
01:26:01,035 --> 01:26:03,319
And the other is transparent.

1213
01:26:03,899 --> 01:26:06,005
Which is used to build
rectangular windows.

1214
01:26:06,463 --> 01:26:08,125
How will you describe
such a kind of activity?

1215
01:26:08,434 --> 01:26:10,885
Isnt this science?
Isnt this technology?

1216
01:26:11,267 --> 01:26:12,285
Nonsense!

1217
01:26:18,418 --> 01:26:22,113
Do you send for a shaman to
treat you when you are unwell?

1218
01:26:24,158 --> 01:26:25,965
I have had recourse to that.

1219
01:26:26,970 --> 01:26:28,125
I had no option.

1220
01:26:29,617 --> 01:26:31,885
Where would you find a
doctor in a jungle?

1221
01:26:33,748 --> 01:26:35,885
But dyou know the kind of
the shaman he is?

1222
01:26:36,426 --> 01:26:40,005
The properties of 500 medicinal
plants are on his finger tips.

1223
01:26:40,525 --> 01:26:41,965
He was able to cure me.

1224
01:26:43,660 --> 01:26:45,725
Normally, I wouldnt
send for a shaman.

1225
01:26:46,566 --> 01:26:50,125
Not when I sit on a sofa
having tea and biscuits with you.

1226
01:26:51,889 --> 01:26:53,645
Why do you insist on twisting
around something,...

1227
01:26:53,805 --> 01:26:55,366
which is basically very simple?

1228
01:26:55,532 --> 01:26:59,205
Why dont you see that
Im not a savage myself?

1229
01:27:00,205 --> 01:27:04,205
Its my greatest regret
that Im not a savage.

1230
01:27:04,725 --> 01:27:07,725
That I cant draw bisons
like a cave hunter.

1231
01:27:09,698 --> 01:27:11,725
But how can I help it?

1232
01:27:12,510 --> 01:27:20,510
Ive Shakespeare and Tagore
Marx Freud in my blood stream.

1233
01:27:22,725 --> 01:27:25,205
Thats why, I cant do
without field notes.

1234
01:27:26,205 --> 01:27:28,502
I wouldnt need them,
if I was a savage, would I?

1235
01:27:34,725 --> 01:27:38,725
You claim to have
studied the Murias.

1236
01:27:39,725 --> 01:27:40,885
I do.

1237
01:27:41,622 --> 01:27:43,725
What do you think of what
goes on in the Ghotuls?

1238
01:27:43,925 --> 01:27:46,769
The sexual freedom that
the young Murias enjoy,...

1239
01:27:47,060 --> 01:27:48,165
Sorry, Nili.

1240
01:27:48,325 --> 01:27:50,205
What do your field notes
say about that?

1241
01:27:50,658 --> 01:27:52,692
Doesnt that amount to
extreme promiscuity?

1242
01:27:52,900 --> 01:27:54,725
Or would you call that
civilized too?

1243
01:27:59,189 --> 01:28:04,365
What you feel in your
heart, I feel in mine.

1244
01:28:05,955 --> 01:28:10,725
What I feel in my heart,
you feel in yours.

1245
01:28:12,365 --> 01:28:14,205
Holy wedlock.

1246
01:28:15,264 --> 01:28:17,350
That is civilized.

1247
01:28:17,766 --> 01:28:23,045
A little while ago you
called yourself omnivorous.

1248
01:28:23,940 --> 01:28:26,565
Have you tasted human flesh?

1249
01:28:27,044 --> 01:28:29,205
No, I havent had
the good fortune.

1250
01:28:29,405 --> 01:28:30,525
Good fortune?

1251
01:28:31,925 --> 01:28:36,285
Ive heard human flesh is tasty!
But I havent eaten it.

1252
01:28:38,107 --> 01:28:42,725
My claim was a fake one
Anila - Im sorry.

1253
01:28:43,306 --> 01:28:45,030
Where in the scale of
civilized behaviour...

1254
01:28:45,106 --> 01:28:47,725
would you place cannibals?

1255
01:28:48,298 --> 01:28:51,325
Civilized?

1256
01:28:52,205 --> 01:28:54,725
Its barbaric!

1257
01:28:55,345 --> 01:28:56,725
Do you know who is
really civilized?

1258
01:28:57,463 --> 01:29:01,288
Its the man who by using his thumb,
presses a button...

1259
01:29:01,365 --> 01:29:05,060
which releases a weapon which
obliterates an entire city...

1260
01:29:05,137 --> 01:29:07,205
with all its inhabitants...

1261
01:29:08,371 --> 01:29:10,205
and you know where,
whos more civilized?

1262
01:29:10,365 --> 01:29:12,725
Its those who take
the decision...

1263
01:29:13,197 --> 01:29:14,925
to use the weapon,
without turning a hair.

1264
01:29:20,205 --> 01:29:22,485
Well, Mr. Sen Gupta.

1265
01:29:23,088 --> 01:29:25,205
The surname doesnt come
easily, does it?

1266
01:29:25,558 --> 01:29:30,645
Still you are so unsure
of my identity.

1267
01:29:31,568 --> 01:29:33,850
May I request something?
I have used a pen name.

1268
01:29:34,027 --> 01:29:38,205
A name very dear to me
in my early years.

1269
01:29:38,635 --> 01:29:39,725
Nemo.

1270
01:29:40,125 --> 01:29:41,654
I suggest that you use that.

1271
01:29:44,805 --> 01:29:49,805
Yes, Latin expression
meaning No One!

1272
01:29:50,809 --> 01:29:52,525
And apt name for me, isnt it?

1273
01:29:52,926 --> 01:29:54,358
Thats exactly what
were trying to decide.

1274
01:29:54,435 --> 01:29:57,205
Whether you are No One
or Some One.

1275
01:29:58,313 --> 01:30:00,685
Do you know what
a serious problem...

1276
01:30:00,885 --> 01:30:03,205
youve set for my friends here?

1277
01:30:04,525 --> 01:30:05,734
Do you know, theyve lost...

1278
01:30:05,811 --> 01:30:07,156
their peace of mind
since you came here?

1279
01:30:08,525 --> 01:30:10,445
Its just because
theyre decent people...

1280
01:30:10,850 --> 01:30:13,285
that they have been too
generous with their hospitality.

1281
01:30:14,140 --> 01:30:16,165
But youve refused to
make it clear to them,...

1282
01:30:16,242 --> 01:30:18,885
whether youre welcome
or unwelcome as a guest.

1283
01:30:19,725 --> 01:30:22,725
Youve said your passport
proves nothing.

1284
01:30:23,387 --> 01:30:26,325
Surely, you yourself know
if its genuine or fake.

1285
01:30:26,563 --> 01:30:29,074
Then why cant you come out
and tell them the truth?

1286
01:31:05,762 --> 01:31:07,994
Ill be off now.

1287
01:31:12,663 --> 01:31:13,725
Listen, listen.

1288
01:31:15,133 --> 01:31:17,485
Did you really have
to be so harsh?

1289
01:31:17,562 --> 01:31:20,045
He is unfit for
civilized society.

1290
01:31:20,510 --> 01:31:22,205
He has no right to encroach
on your hospitality.

1291
01:31:22,440 --> 01:31:24,285
Why talk of encroachment,

1292
01:31:25,283 --> 01:31:27,085
when he is only here
for a short while?

1293
01:31:27,514 --> 01:31:29,898
And you swore not to grill him,
but go about it gently.

1294
01:31:29,975 --> 01:31:32,125
He should know where he stands.

1295
01:31:33,026 --> 01:31:34,525
I know your wife and I know...

1296
01:31:34,697 --> 01:31:36,285
what she is serving him
for lunch or dinner.

1297
01:31:36,362 --> 01:31:39,097
Not field rat meat, surely.

1298
01:31:39,761 --> 01:31:40,968
If I hadnt kicked him off.

1299
01:31:41,045 --> 01:31:43,892
Hed have stuck
to you like a leech.

1300
01:31:44,483 --> 01:31:46,975
You dont know these
parasites, I do.

1301
01:32:06,372 --> 01:32:08,707
I dont know how to...

1302
01:32:16,782 --> 01:32:18,546
I feel miserable.

1303
01:32:20,622 --> 01:32:23,383
Even at dinner,
he didnt say a word.

1304
01:32:31,248 --> 01:32:33,445
If I knew Pritish
would talk like that,...

1305
01:32:34,964 --> 01:32:38,165
Id certainly not
have asked him to come.

1306
01:32:39,053 --> 01:32:42,135
He mentioned traditional
hospitality in his letter.

1307
01:32:43,619 --> 01:32:44,925
Is this a sample of that?

1308
01:32:50,096 --> 01:32:51,925
What we have to do now is...

1309
01:32:52,125 --> 01:32:54,925
to wipe out from his
mind the feeling of hurt...

1310
01:32:55,689 --> 01:32:57,565
that tonights behaviour
has caused him.

1311
01:32:59,633 --> 01:33:03,318
Shall I ask you something?
- What?

1312
01:33:05,570 --> 01:33:07,325
Did you have the least idea
that...

1313
01:33:08,898 --> 01:33:12,445
hes spent half his
life in this fashion?

1314
01:33:15,851 --> 01:33:16,925
None at all.

1315
01:33:19,536 --> 01:33:23,023
Extraordinary life,
full of strange experiences.

1316
01:33:25,628 --> 01:33:27,925
Its certainly been an
education listening to him.

1317
01:33:28,700 --> 01:33:29,925
But at the same time,...

1318
01:33:31,097 --> 01:33:32,925
I felt a distance
growing between us...

1319
01:33:36,182 --> 01:33:39,337
and uncle is someone
you can warm to.

1320
01:33:39,774 --> 01:33:42,365
In this case,

1321
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:48,449
what you feel for him is
reverence and respect.

1322
01:33:50,483 --> 01:33:51,925
The problem is...

1323
01:33:54,490 --> 01:33:57,445
erudition works on the brain,...

1324
01:34:00,250 --> 01:34:02,274
not on the heart.

1325
01:34:05,896 --> 01:34:07,925
You cant bring yourself
to behave like a savage.

1326
01:34:09,808 --> 01:34:11,925
If you could, you could have
easier access to your uncle.

1327
01:34:14,573 --> 01:34:15,925
That can never be.

1328
01:34:17,322 --> 01:34:21,505
But there is no doubt that
we have to make peace with him.

1329
01:34:24,161 --> 01:34:26,445
More than anything else,
he is our guest.

1330
01:34:27,109 --> 01:34:29,144
As such, we have no right
to hurt his feelings.

1331
01:34:31,105 --> 01:34:32,925
You can address him as
uncle if this would help.

1332
01:34:33,803 --> 01:34:34,925
I wont mind...

1333
01:34:38,619 --> 01:34:41,567
that I will,
if it comes from my heart.

1334
01:34:43,269 --> 01:34:45,905
I refuse to be a hypocrite.

1335
01:35:15,348 --> 01:35:17,134
Listen.

1336
01:35:19,989 --> 01:35:21,338
What is it?
- Hes gone.

1337
01:35:21,535 --> 01:35:23,122
His room is empty.
- What?

1338
01:35:23,383 --> 01:35:25,018
Hes gone away with
all his belongings.

1339
01:35:25,095 --> 01:35:26,325
This key was the
only thing left.

1340
01:35:29,703 --> 01:35:31,165
This is just what I feared.

1341
01:35:32,100 --> 01:35:34,445
What shall we do now?
- Wait a minute.

1342
01:35:36,003 --> 01:35:37,860
Let us put two and two together.

1343
01:35:38,846 --> 01:35:40,227
Should we inform the police?

1344
01:35:48,394 --> 01:35:49,702
Give me the directory.

1345
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:52,925
Who do you want me to phone?

1346
01:35:53,967 --> 01:35:58,150
Im working on a hunch.
Give me the book.

1347
01:36:08,735 --> 01:36:09,871
Who is it?

1348
01:36:11,029 --> 01:36:12,350
The main door is open, Sir.

1349
01:36:15,110 --> 01:36:16,270
Since when?

1350
01:36:16,347 --> 01:36:17,485
More than an hour.

1351
01:36:17,672 --> 01:36:19,870
Your door was shut, so I
couldnt come and tell you.

1352
01:36:19,990 --> 01:36:21,350
Its all right.
You may go now.

1353
01:36:21,522 --> 01:36:22,870
Mummy.

1354
01:36:25,456 --> 01:36:27,710
There is no one
in Great-uncles room.

1355
01:36:28,953 --> 01:36:31,951
I know.
- Where has he gone?

1356
01:36:33,095 --> 01:36:33,697
I dont know.

1357
01:36:36,468 --> 01:36:37,951
Whats that?

1358
01:36:39,115 --> 01:36:42,751
Subscriber Trunk Dialing - STD.

1359
01:36:43,473 --> 01:36:45,430
Do you know
Mr. Sitals number?

1360
01:36:48,113 --> 01:36:49,576
Then you tell him.

1361
01:36:49,653 --> 01:36:51,050
Whatll I say?

1362
01:36:51,755 --> 01:36:53,750
Listen carefully.

1363
01:36:54,839 --> 01:36:58,315
Ask him first, if he had
been the executor...

1364
01:36:58,392 --> 01:37:00,691
of your grandfathers will.

1365
01:37:01,905 --> 01:37:05,950
If he says yes, then ask him...

1366
01:37:06,430 --> 01:37:08,950
if your uncle had a share and...

1367
01:37:09,512 --> 01:37:12,554
if the money is still with him.

1368
01:37:14,318 --> 01:37:22,318
Has he informed your uncle
about his share?

1369
01:37:24,950 --> 01:37:28,704
If he says yes, then tell him.

1370
01:37:28,984 --> 01:37:30,322
Well be soon on our way
to Shantiniketan.

1371
01:37:30,728 --> 01:37:32,481
And will arrive around
two in the afternoon.

1372
01:37:33,198 --> 01:37:34,298
Well have lunch on the way.

1373
01:37:34,375 --> 01:37:35,709
So he mustnt
worry on that count.

1374
01:37:36,664 --> 01:37:37,609
Come on, ring him up.

1375
01:38:16,310 --> 01:38:17,929
Come, dear.

1376
01:38:26,698 --> 01:38:28,430
How are you, young man?

1377
01:38:29,304 --> 01:38:31,120
Hasnt he come?
- Oh, yes.

1378
01:38:31,462 --> 01:38:33,216
The train arrived
more than an hour ago.

1379
01:38:33,839 --> 01:38:36,797
Where is he?
- Come, Ill tell you everything.

1380
01:38:37,015 --> 01:38:39,950
You said on the phone that
he is a little temperamental.

1381
01:38:40,253 --> 01:38:43,430
I found him quite
most emphatically so.

1382
01:38:46,013 --> 01:38:48,430
He came here last in 55.

1383
01:38:51,337 --> 01:38:54,751
You know, I had carried him
in my arms to the zoo.

1384
01:38:55,190 --> 01:38:56,950
Where has he gone?

1385
01:38:57,502 --> 01:39:00,376
Hes had nothing to eat
in the morning.

1386
01:39:00,874 --> 01:39:02,773
I asked him, dont you
want lunch?

1387
01:39:03,157 --> 01:39:04,206
He said, no.

1388
01:39:04,372 --> 01:39:06,395
Not even a cup of tea?
No.

1389
01:39:06,831 --> 01:39:08,097
Then what was the point
in coming, I asked him.

1390
01:39:08,346 --> 01:39:09,655
We have met after
such a long time...

1391
01:39:09,819 --> 01:39:11,730
and all you have in mind
is a cold monetary transaction.

1392
01:39:12,113 --> 01:39:13,793
Is that not true?

1393
01:39:14,065 --> 01:39:15,153
What did he say?

1394
01:39:15,508 --> 01:39:17,473
He said, well,
he needed the money.

1395
01:39:18,185 --> 01:39:19,877
But the formalities
can wait because...

1396
01:39:20,178 --> 01:39:21,461
..hes come to stay for
a few days and will go back...

1397
01:39:21,537 --> 01:39:23,953
.. and catch a plane from
Calcutta. So there was no hurry.

1398
01:39:24,273 --> 01:39:26,913
In any case, today is a Sunday.
The bank is closed.

1399
01:39:26,990 --> 01:39:28,873
So hed have to wait
a day any way.

1400
01:39:29,259 --> 01:39:30,793
If you told us where
he is now,...?

1401
01:39:30,953 --> 01:39:34,344
Have you been there before?
- I have.

1402
01:39:34,633 --> 01:39:35,873
Before my marriage, three times.

1403
01:39:36,326 --> 01:39:39,584
Theres a tribal village
on the way called Baner Pukur.

1404
01:39:39,845 --> 01:39:40,873
Thats where he has gone.

1405
01:39:41,744 --> 01:39:44,473
Said before leaving India hed
spend some time in this village.

1406
01:39:45,085 --> 01:39:48,473
Dont ask him what drew him
there in the first place.

1407
01:39:49,206 --> 01:39:50,673
Such a long time since we met.

1408
01:39:50,845 --> 01:39:52,381
One would expect
he would sit down...

1409
01:39:52,458 --> 01:39:55,553
and talk about his experiences.

1410
01:39:56,180 --> 01:39:58,286
And you know the funniest thing?

1411
01:39:58,836 --> 01:40:04,638
Before touching my feet
he held up his passport to prove...

1412
01:40:04,714 --> 01:40:09,473
that he was really
Manmohan Mitra.

1413
01:40:12,593 --> 01:40:14,332
Well, since weve come
around to look for him,...

1414
01:40:14,408 --> 01:40:15,868
perhaps we ought to go and
see if we can hunt him out.

1415
01:40:15,944 --> 01:40:19,433
Very well. And if you find him,
just grab him and bring him here.

1416
01:40:19,553 --> 01:40:21,033
Thats what well do.

1417
01:40:22,613 --> 01:40:23,433
By the way,...

1418
01:40:23,553 --> 01:40:25,234
I hope hes not gone off
his rocker, has he?

1419
01:40:25,311 --> 01:40:27,953
Oh, no.
- Such a lot of money.

1420
01:40:28,233 --> 01:40:30,473
Ive been guarding it like
a treasure for over 2 years.

1421
01:40:30,997 --> 01:40:34,153
5 lakh. You can imagine what
the amount has come to now.

1422
01:40:34,485 --> 01:40:37,473
Dont worry,
he is perfectly sound.

1423
01:41:28,433 --> 01:41:29,433
You there.

1424
01:41:31,902 --> 01:41:34,433
Bring a cot and place
it here, will you?

1425
01:41:35,554 --> 01:41:36,913
Im expecting visitors.

1426
01:41:46,713 --> 01:41:48,913
There. Theres Great uncle.

1427
01:42:21,489 --> 01:42:22,593
Come.

1428
01:42:23,554 --> 01:42:24,593
Sit down.

1429
01:42:29,113 --> 01:42:32,593
Why did you have to do such
a thing without telling us?

1430
01:42:35,593 --> 01:42:37,593
I felt very restless.

1431
01:42:38,107 --> 01:42:43,593
Were extremely sorry for
what happened that night.

1432
01:42:45,330 --> 01:42:46,913
Shall I tell you the truth?

1433
01:42:48,236 --> 01:42:51,513
Im used to the ways of
the jungle folk.

1434
01:42:52,740 --> 01:42:54,593
If I find somebody throwing
his weight around,...

1435
01:42:55,750 --> 01:42:57,338
.. I cant put up
with that.

1436
01:42:57,545 --> 01:42:59,873
Youve had nothing
to eat since morning.

1437
01:43:01,593 --> 01:43:03,593
Weve come to take you back.

1438
01:43:04,375 --> 01:43:05,793
Come.

1439
01:43:06,845 --> 01:43:08,313
Not now.

1440
01:43:09,376 --> 01:43:11,593
It does no harm to fast
for a part of the day.

1441
01:43:13,113 --> 01:43:15,113
Therell be dancing
this afternoon.

1442
01:43:16,113 --> 01:43:17,593
I have arranged it.

1443
01:43:18,593 --> 01:43:20,753
Ill watch the dance
and then go.

1444
01:43:21,872 --> 01:43:23,353
Youll watch it too!

1445
01:43:24,593 --> 01:43:28,113
The kols are the oldest
inhabitants of India.

1446
01:43:29,323 --> 01:43:31,593
The Santals here are
related to this tribe.

1447
01:43:33,113 --> 01:43:35,113
150 years ago,...

1448
01:43:35,965 --> 01:43:38,593
the Santals rose in
rebellion against the British.

1449
01:43:41,268 --> 01:43:44,593
Youll come to Calcutta
to our house?

1450
01:43:46,520 --> 01:43:50,113
Since youve come,
I certainly will.

1451
01:43:51,958 --> 01:43:55,593
But not today, Ill go by
train tomorrow afternoon.

1452
01:43:56,981 --> 01:43:59,113
I have some work here
tomorrow morning.

1453
01:43:59,473 --> 01:44:01,308
Youre coming into some
money, arent you?

1454
01:44:04,593 --> 01:44:06,113
Yes.

1455
01:44:06,954 --> 01:44:10,113
Such good news and you
didnt tell us about it!

1456
01:44:10,273 --> 01:44:11,793
There was a reason for that.

1457
01:44:13,825 --> 01:44:15,273
I felt,

1458
01:44:16,232 --> 01:44:19,793
since I hadnt fulfilled
my obligation to my father,...

1459
01:44:20,113 --> 01:44:23,113
.. I had no claim
to his property.

1460
01:44:24,597 --> 01:44:27,113
Then I thought, such
a large sum of money...

1461
01:44:29,278 --> 01:44:31,113
and since my father had
made it out to me,...

1462
01:44:31,273 --> 01:44:32,753
through sheer affection, then...

1463
01:44:33,113 --> 01:44:34,593
why refuse money?

1464
01:44:37,113 --> 01:44:39,646
Sit down.

1465
01:44:49,173 --> 01:44:52,593
Breath the fresh air.
Theres no more to talk about.

1466
01:47:04,810 --> 01:47:07,113
Do you like it?
- Very much.

1467
01:48:13,599 --> 01:48:15,204
What are you waiting for?

1468
01:48:16,389 --> 01:48:18,193
Shall I?
- By all means.

1469
01:48:44,590 --> 01:48:46,753
You see what your niece
is up to?

1470
01:48:49,730 --> 01:48:53,033
I have often doubted whether
she is really my niece.

1471
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:55,793
Not any more.

1472
01:49:14,193 --> 01:49:17,193
Keep my suitcase as a
memento then.

1473
01:49:18,833 --> 01:49:21,193
I grew very attached to it.

1474
01:49:22,471 --> 01:49:23,979
I didnt know why
you have to,...

1475
01:49:24,056 --> 01:49:26,153
because youre yet to
be civilized in some respects.

1476
01:49:26,574 --> 01:49:29,673
Very well.
Your word is law.

1477
01:49:30,871 --> 01:49:32,995
And these note books,
you need them all?

1478
01:49:33,205 --> 01:49:35,193
But they are my
field notes, dear

1479
01:49:35,673 --> 01:49:38,673
Ive thrown away the ones
Ive no need for.

1480
01:49:39,673 --> 01:49:43,130
Well, Ill leave them then.
You pay excess baggage.

1481
01:49:43,673 --> 01:49:45,416
After all, youre a millionaire.

1482
01:49:45,492 --> 01:49:48,433
Wed all settled on coming
to the airport with you.

1483
01:49:48,673 --> 01:49:50,673
Yes, youd be unsettled
if you found out...

1484
01:49:50,978 --> 01:49:54,464
the plane was eight hours late.

1485
01:49:56,896 --> 01:49:58,879
You can count on the Sun
and Moon to be punctual...

1486
01:49:58,955 --> 01:50:00,433
but not the airlines.

1487
01:50:05,433 --> 01:50:06,873
Take these bags downstairs.

1488
01:50:16,673 --> 01:50:18,673
I told you to wait...

1489
01:50:19,275 --> 01:50:21,193
and heres your reward.

1490
01:50:24,658 --> 01:50:29,193
It was made by the Armadillo
Cater, 1500 years ago.

1491
01:50:29,702 --> 01:50:31,193
Say thank you.
- No.

1492
01:50:33,473 --> 01:50:35,673
Theres no better thanks
than that smile.

1493
01:50:42,919 --> 01:50:45,141
I have forgotten to
tell you one thing.

1494
01:50:45,218 --> 01:50:48,673
Ive written a book.
A sort of travel book.

1495
01:50:49,276 --> 01:50:51,193
An Indian amongst Indians.

1496
01:50:51,610 --> 01:50:53,833
An American publisher
is bringing it out.

1497
01:50:54,351 --> 01:50:57,193
Hes given me an handsome
advance on it.

1498
01:50:57,805 --> 01:51:00,673
Then you are really rich now.
- Indeed, I am.

1499
01:51:05,589 --> 01:51:06,673
Youll write?

1500
01:51:07,081 --> 01:51:10,193
What Ill do...
once Im in my element.

1501
01:51:10,956 --> 01:51:12,384
Just to say
youve arrived safely.

1502
01:51:12,659 --> 01:51:13,833
That Ill do.

1503
01:51:27,189 --> 01:51:29,673
One final duty.

1504
01:51:32,513 --> 01:51:33,993
What is it?

1505
01:51:34,519 --> 01:51:36,513
Have you heard of the
English word...

1506
01:51:37,178 --> 01:51:39,773
Floccinancinihili
Pilification?

1507
01:51:40,616 --> 01:51:43,518
Yes. I learnt it in school.

1508
01:51:46,745 --> 01:51:47,993
Dyou know what it means?

1509
01:51:49,518 --> 01:51:51,188
Not really.

1510
01:51:53,993 --> 01:51:56,183
29 letters to convey
this meaning.

1511
01:51:56,491 --> 01:51:58,513
A sure sign of civilization.

1512
01:52:00,707 --> 01:52:02,993
Not now, let me go first.

1513
01:52:03,545 --> 01:52:05,524
I feel very embarrassed
if someone reads...

1514
01:52:05,848 --> 01:52:08,673
something Ive written,
in my presence.

1515
01:52:09,496 --> 01:52:13,513
Just a few lines to
thank you for your hospitality.

1516
01:52:16,988 --> 01:52:18,513
Well, Satyaki.

1517
01:52:20,994 --> 01:52:23,073
Its time your Great-uncle
started on his trips.

1518
01:52:24,156 --> 01:52:26,113
Wont you ever come back?

1519
01:52:26,361 --> 01:52:28,308
Its your turn to come to me.

1520
01:52:28,600 --> 01:52:30,993
Youve promised never to
become something....

1521
01:52:31,989 --> 01:52:35,513
Kupamunduk.
- Dont forget.

1522
01:52:35,849 --> 01:52:37,353
Well then.

1523
01:52:39,903 --> 01:52:43,941
Ive been most remiss, uncle.
Please forgive me.

1524
01:52:46,513 --> 01:52:47,993
Youve been remiss.

1525
01:52:48,919 --> 01:52:51,993
Didnt I know what a serious
problem I had set for you?

1526
01:52:53,151 --> 01:52:54,993
But there was a reason for that.

1527
01:52:55,649 --> 01:52:57,993
What does a passport tell you?

1528
01:52:59,476 --> 01:53:03,513
The name of the holder
and what he looks like.

1529
01:53:03,993 --> 01:53:06,513
But it doesnt tell you
what the person is like.

1530
01:53:06,993 --> 01:53:08,993
To know this, it takes time.

1531
01:53:09,319 --> 01:53:11,353
That time was needed.

1532
01:53:15,993 --> 01:53:18,753
Is the touching of feet
common among of the savages?

1533
01:53:19,096 --> 01:53:20,513
Not that I know of.

1534
01:53:20,913 --> 01:53:23,513
Then instead of that, if...

1535
01:53:29,879 --> 01:53:31,993
Good bye, then.

1536
01:53:55,338 --> 01:53:58,433
Wait. Lets see
what uncle has to say.

1537
01:54:01,450 --> 01:54:02,993
But this is addressed to you.

1538
01:54:03,353 --> 01:54:04,513
A poem.

1539
01:54:05,699 --> 01:54:07,993
Blood is thicker than water

1540
01:54:08,153 --> 01:54:10,153
So my share goes to one...

1541
01:54:11,959 --> 01:54:13,993
.. whos more than
my daughter.

1542
01:54:17,926 --> 01:54:18,993
Whats that?

1543
01:54:25,143 --> 01:54:26,513
Its made out to me.

1544
01:54:26,975 --> 01:54:28,993
And Sitals signature.

1545
01:54:29,521 --> 01:54:30,993
Dont you see?

1546
01:54:32,513 --> 01:54:37,193
Hes willed his entire
share to you.

1547
01:54:40,581 --> 01:54:42,513
Mr. No one

1547
