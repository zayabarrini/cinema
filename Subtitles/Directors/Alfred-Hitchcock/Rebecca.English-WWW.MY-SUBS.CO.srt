00:01:54,945 --> 00:01:58,406
Last night,
I dreamt I went to Manderley again.

3
00:01:59,366 --> 00:02:02,785
It seemed to me I stood by the iron gate
leading to the drive,

4
00:02:03,704 --> 00:02:07,749
and for a while, I could not enter,
for the way was barred to me.

5
00:02:08,292 --> 00:02:10,293
Then, like all dreamers,

6
00:02:11,045 --> 00:02:14,464
I was possessed of a sudden
with supernatural powers

7
00:02:14,632 --> 00:02:18,134
and passed like a spirit
through the barrier before me.

8
00:02:18,927 --> 00:02:21,554
The drive wound away in front of me,

9
00:02:21,722 --> 00:02:24,641
twisting and turning
as it had always done.

10
00:02:25,142 --> 00:02:26,809
But as I advanced,

11
00:02:26,977 --> 00:02:29,812
I was aware
that a change had come upon it.

12
00:02:30,147 --> 00:02:33,983
Nature had come into her own again,
and little by little

13
00:02:34,151 --> 00:02:38,571
had encroached upon the drive
with long, tenacious fingers.

14
00:02:41,116 --> 00:02:45,578
On and on wound the poor thread
that had once been our drive,

15
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:49,749
and finally, there was Manderley.

16
00:02:50,584 --> 00:02:53,336
Manderley, secretive and silent.

17
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:57,340
Time could not mar
the perfect symmetry of those walls.

18
00:02:58,342 --> 00:03:01,260
Moonlight can play odd tricks
upon the fancy,

19
00:03:01,595 --> 00:03:05,848
and suddenly it seemed to me
that light came from the windows.

20
00:03:09,103 --> 00:03:11,688
And then a cloud came upon the moon

21
00:03:12,064 --> 00:03:15,858
and hovered an instant
like a dark hand before a face.

22
00:03:16,861 --> 00:03:18,862
The illusion went with it.

23
00:03:20,365 --> 00:03:22,741
I looked upon a desolate shell

24
00:03:23,535 --> 00:03:27,413
with no whisper of the past
about its staring walls.

25
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,667
We can never go back to Manderley again.

26
00:03:31,835 --> 00:03:33,544
That much is certain.

27
00:03:33,753 --> 00:03:37,840
But sometimes in my dreams,
I do go back

28
00:03:38,007 --> 00:03:40,092
to the strange days of my life

29
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,387
which began for me
in the South of France.

30
00:04:18,256 --> 00:04:19,548
No! Stop!

31
00:04:20,717 --> 00:04:23,302
What the devil are you shouting about?

32
00:04:25,513 --> 00:04:28,140
Who are you? What are you staring at?

33
00:04:28,933 --> 00:04:31,810
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to stare,
but I... I only thought...

34
00:04:31,978 --> 00:04:34,605
Oh, you did, did you?
Well, what are you doing here?

35
00:04:34,773 --> 00:04:36,315
I was only walking.

36
00:04:36,483 --> 00:04:39,818
Well, get on with your walking.
Don't hang about here screaming.

37
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:08,181
I'll never come to Monte Carlo
out of season again.

38
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:11,643
Not a single well-known personality
in the hotel.

39
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,396
Stone cold. Waiter!

40
00:05:15,564 --> 00:05:18,274
Garcon! Call him.
Tell him to get me some...

41
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,652
Why, it's Max de Winter.

42
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:28,827
How do you do?

43
00:05:28,994 --> 00:05:32,121
I'm Edythe Van Hopper.
It's so nice to run into you here,

44
00:05:32,289 --> 00:05:35,834
just when I was beginning to despair of
finding any old friends here in Monte.

45
00:05:36,001 --> 00:05:37,669
But do sit down and have some coffee.

46
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,170
Mr. De Winter is having
some coffee with me.

47
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:41,798
Go and ask that stupid waiter
for another cup.

48
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:43,842
I'm afraid I must contradict you.

49
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:46,553
You shall both have coffee with me.

50
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,346
Garcon. Coffee, please.

51
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,056
- Cigarette?
- No, thank you.

52
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:52,934
You know,
I recognized you as soon as you came in,

53
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:57,063
though I haven't seen you since that
night at the casino at Palm Beach.

54
00:05:57,356 --> 00:05:59,732
Perhaps you don't remember
an old woman like me.

55
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,734
Are you playing the tables much
here at Monte?

56
00:06:01,902 --> 00:06:04,737
No. I'm afraid that sort of thing
ceased to amuse me years ago.

57
00:06:04,905 --> 00:06:06,364
I can well understand that.

58
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:08,700
As for me, if I had
a home like Manderley,

59
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,702
I should certainly never come to Monte.

60
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,496
I hear it's one of the biggest places
in that part of the country,

61
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:15,373
and you just can't beat it for beauty.

62
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,793
What do you think of Monte Carlo?
Or don't you think of it at all?

63
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:21,212
Well, I think it's rather artificial.

64
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,548
She's spoiled, Mr. De Winter,
that's her trouble.

65
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:26,593
Most girls will give their eyes
for a chance to see Monte.

66
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,305
Wouldn't that rather defeat the purpose?

67
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,808
Now that we've found each other again,
I hope I shall see something of you.

68
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:35,144
You must come and have a drink
in my suite.

69
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,062
I hope they've given you a good room.

70
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,399
The place is empty, so if you're
uncomfortable, mind you make a fuss.

71
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,568
Your valet has unpacked for you,
I suppose?

72
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:45,738
I'm afraid I don't possess one.
Perhaps you would like to do it for me?

73
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:49,742
Well, I... I hardly think...

74
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,952
Perhaps you could make yourself
useful to Mr. De Winter

75
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,412
if he wants anything done.

76
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,414
You're a capable child in many ways.

77
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:58,542
That's a charming suggestion,
but I'm afraid I cling to the old motto,

78
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:02,922
"He travels fastest who travels alone. "
Perhaps you've not heard it. Good night.

79
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:05,841
What do you make of that?

80
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:09,053
Do you suppose that sudden departure
was intended to be funny?

81
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,639
Come, don't sit there gawking,
let's go upstairs.

82
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:13,724
- Have you got the key?
- Yes, Mrs. Van Hopper.

83
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:16,894
I remember, when I was younger,
there was a well-known writer

84
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:20,147
who used to dart down the back way
whenever he saw me coming.

85
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:23,943
I suppose he was in love with me
and wasn't quite sure of himself.

86
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,861
Well, c'est la vie.

87
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:30,115
By the way, my dear,
don't think that I mean to be unkind,

88
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:33,535
but you were just a teeny-weeny bit
forward with Mr. De Winter.

89
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:36,205
Your effort to enter the conversation
quite embarrassed me,

90
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:39,833
and I'm sure it did him.
Men loathe that sort of thing.

91
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:43,879
Oh, come, don't sulk. After all,
I am responsible for your behavior here.

92
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,631
Perhaps he didn't notice it.

93
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:49,176
Poor thing, I suppose he just
can't get over his wife's death.

94
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:53,097
They say he simply adored her.

95
00:08:12,952 --> 00:08:14,661
Oh... How awkward of me.

96
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:19,249
What a stupid thing to do.
Oh, I'm so sorry.

97
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:20,959
Please don't bother.
It doesn't really matter.

98
00:08:21,127 --> 00:08:23,128
No, leave that, leave that.
Go and lay another place at my table.

99
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,922
- Mademoiselle will have lunch with me.
- Oh, but I couldn't possibly.

100
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:28,341
- Why not?
- Oh, well, please don't be polite. I...

101
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:31,011
It's very kind of you but I'll be
all right if they just change the cloth.

102
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:32,095
I wasn't being polite.

103
00:08:32,263 --> 00:08:33,179
I should have asked you
to have lunch with me

104
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:35,015
even if you hadn't upset the vase
so clumsily.

105
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:36,349
Come along.

106
00:08:36,851 --> 00:08:38,935
We needn't talk to each other
if we don't feel like it.

107
00:08:39,103 --> 00:08:40,854
Well, thank you very much.

108
00:08:45,735 --> 00:08:48,361
Oh, I... I'll just have
some scrambled eggs.

109
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:49,863
Oui, mademoiselle.

110
00:08:52,158 --> 00:08:55,952
- What's happened to your friend?
- She's ill in bed with a cold.

111
00:08:56,704 --> 00:08:58,913
I'm sorry I was so
rude to you yesterday.

112
00:08:59,415 --> 00:09:02,876
The only excuse I can offer is that I've
become boorish through living alone.

113
00:09:03,044 --> 00:09:05,587
You weren't really.
You simply wanted to be alone and...

114
00:09:05,755 --> 00:09:09,632
Tell me, is Mrs. Van Hopper
a friend of yours or just a relation?

115
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,886
No, she's my employer.
I'm what is known as "a paid companion. "

116
00:09:13,054 --> 00:09:14,763
I didn't know companionship
could be bought.

117
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,723
I looked at the word "companion"
in the dictionary once.

118
00:09:16,891 --> 00:09:19,267
It said, "a friend of the bosom. "

119
00:09:20,102 --> 00:09:22,020
I don't envy you the privilege.

120
00:09:22,188 --> 00:09:25,231
Well, she's very kind, really,
and I have to earn my living.

121
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,941
Haven't you any family?

122
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:29,527
No. My mother died years and years ago,

123
00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:33,073
and there was only my father,
and he died last summer.

124
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:35,742
And then I took this job.

125
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:37,410
How rotten for you.

126
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:40,747
Yes, it was rather, because, you see,
we got on so well together.

127
00:09:40,915 --> 00:09:42,124
You and your father?

128
00:09:42,292 --> 00:09:45,294
Yes. He was a lovely person,
very unusual.

129
00:09:45,462 --> 00:09:47,213
- What was he?
- A painter.

130
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,756
Ah! Was he a good one?

131
00:09:48,924 --> 00:09:52,343
Well, I thought so,
but people didn't understand him.

132
00:09:52,511 --> 00:09:54,428
Yes, that's often the trouble.

133
00:09:54,596 --> 00:09:58,265
He painted trees.
At least, it was one tree.

134
00:09:58,433 --> 00:10:00,559
You mean, he painted the same tree
over and over again?

135
00:10:00,727 --> 00:10:04,730
Yes. You see, he had a theory that
if you should find one perfect thing

136
00:10:04,898 --> 00:10:06,816
or place or person,
you should stick to it.

137
00:10:06,983 --> 00:10:08,442
Do you think that's really silly?

138
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:11,112
Not at all.
I'm a firm believer in that myself.

139
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,323
And what did you find to do with
yourself while he was painting his tree?

140
00:10:14,491 --> 00:10:18,035
Well, I sat with him and I sketched a
little. I don't do it very well, though.

141
00:10:18,203 --> 00:10:19,578
Were you going sketching
this afternoon?

142
00:10:19,746 --> 00:10:20,746
Yes.

143
00:10:20,914 --> 00:10:22,456
- Where?
- Well, I haven't made up my mind.

144
00:10:22,624 --> 00:10:24,125
I'll drive you somewhere in the car.

145
00:10:24,292 --> 00:10:25,626
Oh, no, please, I didn't mean...

146
00:10:25,794 --> 00:10:28,045
Oh, nonsense. Finish up that mess,
and we'll get along.

147
00:10:28,213 --> 00:10:31,090
Thank you. It's very kind of you,
but I'm not very hungry.

148
00:10:31,258 --> 00:10:33,843
Come on. Eat it up like a good girl.

149
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:46,689
You've taken long enough
for that sketch.

150
00:10:46,857 --> 00:10:48,649
I shall expect a really fine
work of art.

151
00:10:48,817 --> 00:10:50,609
Oh, no, don't look at it.
It's not nearly good enough.

152
00:10:50,777 --> 00:10:52,695
Well, it can't be as bad as all that.
Now don't rub it all out.

153
00:10:52,863 --> 00:10:53,904
Let me see it first.

154
00:10:54,072 --> 00:10:56,115
Well, it's the perspective.
I never can get it right.

155
00:10:56,283 --> 00:10:58,284
Let me see it, let me see it. Oh, dear.

156
00:10:58,451 --> 00:11:01,537
Tell me, is it the perspective
that gives my nose that curious

157
00:11:01,705 --> 00:11:02,705
twist in the middle?

158
00:11:03,331 --> 00:11:05,457
Well, you're not a very easy subject
to sketch. Your...

159
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,168
Your expression keeps changing
all the time.

160
00:11:07,335 --> 00:11:08,335
Does it?

161
00:11:08,503 --> 00:11:11,422
Well, I'd... I'd concentrate on the view
instead, if I were you.

162
00:11:11,923 --> 00:11:13,799
Much more worthwhile.

163
00:11:14,676 --> 00:11:17,928
It rather reminds me of our coastline
at home. Do you know Cornwall at all?

164
00:11:18,096 --> 00:11:21,641
Yes, I went there once with my father
on holiday. I was in a shop once,

165
00:11:21,851 --> 00:11:26,605
and I saw a postcard with a beautiful
house on it, right by the sea.

166
00:11:27,023 --> 00:11:30,609
I asked whose house it was, and
the old lady said, "That's Manderley. "

167
00:11:30,776 --> 00:11:32,444
I felt ashamed for not knowing.

168
00:11:32,612 --> 00:11:34,112
Manderley is beautiful.

169
00:11:34,363 --> 00:11:37,949
But to me,
it's just the place where I was born,

170
00:11:39,202 --> 00:11:41,536
and have lived in all my life.

171
00:11:42,371 --> 00:11:45,248
But now, I don't suppose
I shall ever see it again.

172
00:11:52,006 --> 00:11:56,051
We're lucky not to be home
during the bad weather, aren't we?

173
00:11:57,678 --> 00:12:02,140
I can't ever remember enjoying
swimming in England till June, can you?

174
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:08,146
The water's so warm here
that I could stay in all day.

175
00:12:08,314 --> 00:12:11,942
There's a dangerous undertow and
there was a man drowned here last year.

176
00:12:13,903 --> 00:12:16,780
I never have any fear of drowning.
Have you?

177
00:12:24,205 --> 00:12:26,248
Come, I'll take you home.

178
00:12:40,221 --> 00:12:43,890
Oh, yes, I know Mr. De Winter well.
I knew his wife, too.

179
00:12:44,058 --> 00:12:47,310
Before she married, she was the
beautiful Rebecca Hildreth, you know.

180
00:12:47,478 --> 00:12:50,105
She was drowned, poor dear,
while she was sailing near Manderley.

181
00:12:50,273 --> 00:12:52,899
He never talks about it, of course,
but he's a broken man.

182
00:12:53,067 --> 00:12:54,986
I suppose I'd better have it.

183
00:12:55,153 --> 00:12:56,904
Wretched stuff!
Give me a chocolate, quick!

184
00:12:58,282 --> 00:13:00,449
Oh, there you are. It's about time.

185
00:13:00,617 --> 00:13:03,244
Hurry up. I want to play some rummy.

186
00:13:10,335 --> 00:13:12,712
She was the beautiful
Rebecca Hildreth, you know.

187
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:14,797
They say he simply adored her.

188
00:13:14,965 --> 00:13:17,049
She was the beautiful Rebecca
Hildreth, you know.

189
00:13:17,217 --> 00:13:19,510
I suppose he just can't
get over his wife's death.

190
00:13:19,678 --> 00:13:21,554
She was the beautiful Rebecca
Hildreth, you know.

191
00:13:21,722 --> 00:13:23,597
But he's a broken man.

192
00:13:26,393 --> 00:13:27,393
Bonjour.

193
00:13:27,936 --> 00:13:30,271
- Well, where are you going?
- I thought I'd take a tennis lesson.

194
00:13:30,439 --> 00:13:31,480
I see.

195
00:13:31,648 --> 00:13:35,151
I suppose you've had a look at the pro,
and he's desperately handsome,

196
00:13:35,319 --> 00:13:37,820
and you've conceived
a schoolgirl crush on him.

197
00:13:37,988 --> 00:13:39,697
All right. Go ahead.
Make the most of it.

198
00:13:42,826 --> 00:13:43,951
Off duty?

199
00:13:44,119 --> 00:13:46,537
Well, yes. Mrs. Van Hopper's
cold's turned into flu,

200
00:13:46,705 --> 00:13:47,747
so she's got a trained nurse.

201
00:13:47,914 --> 00:13:49,623
I'm sorry for the nurse.
You keen on tennis?

202
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:53,044
- Well, not particularly.
- That's good. We'll go for a drive.

203
00:14:13,148 --> 00:14:15,524
Good afternoon, Mrs. Van Hopper.
How are you feeling?

204
00:14:15,776 --> 00:14:18,569
You got on rather well
with him, didn't you?

205
00:14:19,321 --> 00:14:22,323
That pro must have been teaching you
other things than tennis.

206
00:14:23,784 --> 00:14:26,077
Hurry up, I want you to make some calls.

207
00:14:26,411 --> 00:14:29,330
I wonder
if Mr. De Winter is still in the hotel.

208
00:15:22,677 --> 00:15:24,136
May I go now?

209
00:15:24,762 --> 00:15:27,764
For the number of lessons you've had,
you ought to be ready for Wimbledon.

210
00:15:27,932 --> 00:15:29,933
But this will be your last,
so make the most of it.

211
00:15:30,101 --> 00:15:32,561
The trouble is, with me laid up like
this, you haven't had enough to do.

212
00:15:32,728 --> 00:15:36,606
I'm getting rid of that nurse today. And
from now on, you'll stick to your job.

213
00:15:37,692 --> 00:15:39,484
Yes, Mrs. Van Hopper.

214
00:15:41,612 --> 00:15:43,655
- Nurse?
- Yes, Mrs. Hopper?

215
00:15:43,823 --> 00:15:47,117
Are you absolutely sure you left
those messages for Mr. De Winter?

216
00:15:47,285 --> 00:15:50,120
- Why, yes, madame.
- I simply can't believe it.

217
00:15:50,371 --> 00:15:52,456
He would most certainly
have called me back.

218
00:15:52,623 --> 00:15:55,709
Oh, well. Poor boy, I simply hate
to see him so alone.

219
00:16:03,468 --> 00:16:06,386
You know, I... I wish there could be
an invention

220
00:16:06,554 --> 00:16:10,641
that bottled up the memory,
like perfume, and it never faded,

221
00:16:10,809 --> 00:16:11,851
never got stale.

222
00:16:12,019 --> 00:16:14,812
Then whenever I wanted to,
I could uncork the bottle

223
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,772
and live the memory all over again.

224
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,567
And what particular moment in your
young life would you want to keep?

225
00:16:19,735 --> 00:16:21,694
All of them. All these last few days.

226
00:16:21,987 --> 00:16:26,491
I feel as though I'd... I'd collected
a whole shelf full of bottles.

227
00:16:28,118 --> 00:16:30,578
Sometimes, you know,
those little bottles contain demons

228
00:16:30,746 --> 00:16:32,163
that have a way of popping out at you,

229
00:16:32,331 --> 00:16:34,916
just as you're trying
most desperately to forget.

230
00:16:46,261 --> 00:16:48,137
Stop biting your nails.

231
00:16:50,098 --> 00:16:54,227
I wish I were a woman of 36, dressed
in black satin with a string of pearls.

232
00:16:54,686 --> 00:16:57,522
You wouldn't be here
with me if you were.

233
00:16:59,441 --> 00:17:03,486
Would you please tell me, Mr. De Winter,
why you asked me to come out with you?

234
00:17:03,654 --> 00:17:08,783
It's obvious you want to be kind, but
why do you choose me for your charity?

235
00:17:15,249 --> 00:17:18,668
I asked you to come out with me
because I wanted your company.

236
00:17:18,835 --> 00:17:20,461
You've blotted out
the past for me more than

237
00:17:20,629 --> 00:17:23,381
all the bright lights
of Monte Carlo.

238
00:17:23,549 --> 00:17:25,841
But if you think I just asked you
out of kindness or charity,

239
00:17:26,009 --> 00:17:28,719
you can leave the car now
and find your own way home.

240
00:17:28,887 --> 00:17:31,222
Go on. Open the door and get out.

241
00:17:39,273 --> 00:17:41,566
- Better blow your nose.
- Thank you.

242
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:45,988
Please don't call me Mr. De Winter.

243
00:17:46,155 --> 00:17:48,699
I have a very impressive array
of first names.

244
00:17:48,866 --> 00:17:50,617
George Fortescue Maximilian.

245
00:17:50,785 --> 00:17:54,413
You needn't bother with them all
at once. My family call me Maxim.

246
00:17:56,165 --> 00:17:57,624
And another thing,

247
00:17:58,042 --> 00:18:01,420
please promise me
never to wear black satin or pearls,

248
00:18:02,171 --> 00:18:04,047
or to be 36 years old.

249
00:18:05,091 --> 00:18:06,758
Yes, Maxim.

250
00:18:42,629 --> 00:18:45,005
For the love of Pete! Come here!

251
00:18:45,632 --> 00:18:48,300
What do you think?
My daughter's engaged to be married.

252
00:18:48,468 --> 00:18:49,468
Oh, really? How nice!

253
00:18:49,636 --> 00:18:52,721
We must leave for New York at once.
Get reservations on the Aquitania,

254
00:18:52,889 --> 00:18:55,307
and we'll take the 12:30 train
for Cherbourg.

255
00:18:55,475 --> 00:18:56,892
Hurry up and get me the maid
to help with the packing.

256
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,811
We've no time to waste.
Go on and don't dawdle.

257
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:05,192
Mr. De Winter, please.

258
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,778
He's gone out riding?

259
00:19:08,321 --> 00:19:09,905
He won't be back till noon?

260
00:19:14,077 --> 00:19:15,952
Give me the porter, please.

261
00:19:24,672 --> 00:19:27,507
I'll go and see
if there's anything left in my room.

262
00:19:34,181 --> 00:19:36,516
Has Mr. De Winter come in yet?

263
00:19:37,017 --> 00:19:39,352
Oh, he has?
Would you connect me, please?

264
00:19:49,405 --> 00:19:53,157
I was looking for my book.
I suppose I've packed it.

265
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:55,702
Well, come on,
the car's waiting at the door.

266
00:20:11,093 --> 00:20:14,721
I'd like to leave a forwarding address,
if they happen to find that book.

267
00:20:17,975 --> 00:20:20,810
- Would you ring Mr. De Winter, please?
- Yes, madame.

268
00:20:31,321 --> 00:20:33,740
- There isn't any answer.
- Thank you.

269
00:20:36,076 --> 00:20:38,453
- Tell her to hurry up!
- Yes, madame.

270
00:20:40,789 --> 00:20:42,248
I was looking for Mr. De Winter.

271
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:45,752
Mr. De Winter just ordered breakfast
in his room, mademoiselle.

272
00:20:51,008 --> 00:20:52,258
Come in.

273
00:21:05,565 --> 00:21:07,900
Hello. What are you doing here?

274
00:21:08,526 --> 00:21:09,818
Anything the matter?

275
00:21:09,986 --> 00:21:12,613
I've come to say goodbye.
We're going away.

276
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:15,073
What on Earth are you talking about?

277
00:21:15,241 --> 00:21:16,867
It's true. We're going now,

278
00:21:17,035 --> 00:21:19,453
and I was afraid
I wouldn't see you again.

279
00:21:26,711 --> 00:21:29,797
- Where's she taking you to?
- New York. I don't want to go.

280
00:21:29,964 --> 00:21:32,633
I shall hate it.
I shall be miserable.

281
00:21:36,888 --> 00:21:38,639
I'll dress in here.

282
00:21:39,224 --> 00:21:40,808
I shan't be long.

283
00:21:43,853 --> 00:21:46,980
Which would you prefer,
New York or Manderley?

284
00:21:47,649 --> 00:21:49,483
Oh, please don't joke about it.

285
00:21:49,692 --> 00:21:53,654
Mrs. Van Hopper's waiting.
I'd better say goodbye now.

286
00:21:54,781 --> 00:21:56,448
I'll repeat what I said.

287
00:21:56,616 --> 00:21:58,659
Either you go to America
with Mrs. Van Hopper,

288
00:21:58,827 --> 00:22:01,078
or you come home to Manderley with me.

289
00:22:01,496 --> 00:22:03,831
You mean you want a secretary
or something?

290
00:22:03,998 --> 00:22:07,084
I'm asking you to marry me,
you little fool.

291
00:22:15,802 --> 00:22:17,010
Come in.

292
00:22:19,138 --> 00:22:22,474
Is that my food? I'm famished.
I didn't have any breakfast.

293
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:40,785
My suggestion didn't seem
to go at all well. Sorry.

294
00:22:40,953 --> 00:22:42,745
Oh, but you don't understand.
It's the...

295
00:22:43,539 --> 00:22:47,375
- I'm not the sort of person men marry.
- What on Earth do you mean?

296
00:22:47,751 --> 00:22:50,545
I don't belong in your sort of world,
for one thing.

297
00:22:50,713 --> 00:22:52,380
Well, what is my sort of world?

298
00:22:52,715 --> 00:22:55,383
Well, Manderley. You know what I mean.

299
00:22:55,593 --> 00:22:58,428
Well, I'm the best judge of whether
you belong there or not.

300
00:22:58,596 --> 00:23:01,306
Of course, if you don't love me,
that's a different thing.

301
00:23:01,473 --> 00:23:03,016
Fine blow to my conceit, that's all.

302
00:23:03,183 --> 00:23:05,351
I do love you.
I love you most dreadfully.

303
00:23:05,769 --> 00:23:09,522
I've been crying all morning because
I thought I'd never see you again.

304
00:23:13,444 --> 00:23:15,194
Bless you for that.

305
00:23:17,072 --> 00:23:21,576
I'll remind you of this one day
and you won't believe me.

306
00:23:22,453 --> 00:23:24,454
It's a pity you have to grow up.

307
00:23:25,831 --> 00:23:28,583
Well, now that's settled.
You may pour me out some coffee.

308
00:23:28,751 --> 00:23:32,337
Two lumps of sugar and some milk,
please. Same with my tea, don't forget.

309
00:23:33,422 --> 00:23:36,174
Who is going to break the news to
Mrs. Van Hopper? Shall you or should I?

310
00:23:36,342 --> 00:23:38,134
You tell her. She'll be so angry.

311
00:23:38,302 --> 00:23:39,761
What's the number of her room?

312
00:23:39,929 --> 00:23:42,889
She's not there.
She's downstairs in the car.

313
00:23:43,182 --> 00:23:45,600
Hello. Give me the desk, please.

314
00:23:48,354 --> 00:23:51,898
Hello. You'll find Mrs. Van Hopper
waiting outside in her car.

315
00:23:52,066 --> 00:23:53,107
Would you ask her,
with my compliments,

316
00:23:53,275 --> 00:23:55,777
if she'd very kindly come up
and see me in my room?

317
00:23:57,071 --> 00:23:58,655
Yes, in my room.

318
00:24:00,282 --> 00:24:03,076
Mr. De Winter says
please for you to come up to his room.

319
00:24:03,243 --> 00:24:04,827
Mr. De Winter?

320
00:24:05,829 --> 00:24:07,372
Why, certainly.

321
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:16,256
This isn't at all
your idea of a proposal, is it?

322
00:24:16,424 --> 00:24:18,217
It should be in a conservatory,

323
00:24:18,385 --> 00:24:21,220
you in a white frock,
with a red rose in your hand,

324
00:24:21,554 --> 00:24:23,722
and a violin playing in the distance,

325
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:27,059
and I should be making violent love
to you behind a palm tree.

326
00:24:27,727 --> 00:24:30,229
Poor darling. Never mind.

327
00:24:30,397 --> 00:24:31,313
I don't mind.

328
00:24:32,565 --> 00:24:35,484
Don't worry. Don't worry.
You won't have to say a word.

329
00:24:37,153 --> 00:24:39,279
I'm so glad you called me,
Mr. De Winter.

330
00:24:39,447 --> 00:24:41,073
I was making a hasty departure.

331
00:24:41,241 --> 00:24:42,908
It was so rude of me
not to let you know.

332
00:24:43,076 --> 00:24:45,327
But a cable came this morning
announcing that my daughter

333
00:24:45,495 --> 00:24:46,620
is engaged to be married.

334
00:24:46,788 --> 00:24:48,455
That's rather a coincidence,
Mrs. Van Hopper.

335
00:24:48,999 --> 00:24:51,208
I asked you up here in order
to tell you of my engagement.

336
00:24:51,376 --> 00:24:54,795
You don't mean it.
How perfectly wonderful.

337
00:24:54,963 --> 00:24:57,673
How romantic. Who is the lucky lady?

338
00:24:58,341 --> 00:25:01,677
I apologize for depriving you
of your companion in this abrupt way.

339
00:25:01,845 --> 00:25:04,138
I do hope it won't inconvenience you
too greatly.

340
00:25:04,305 --> 00:25:06,223
When did all this happen?

341
00:25:07,517 --> 00:25:10,519
Just now, Mrs. Van Hopper.
Just a few minutes ago.

342
00:25:10,687 --> 00:25:12,896
I simply can't believe it.

343
00:25:14,816 --> 00:25:16,066
And I suppose I ought to scold you

344
00:25:16,234 --> 00:25:18,694
for not having breathed a word
of all of this to me.

345
00:25:18,862 --> 00:25:20,237
What am I thinking of?

346
00:25:20,405 --> 00:25:22,865
I should give you both
my congratulations and my blessings.

347
00:25:23,033 --> 00:25:24,825
I'm very happy for you both.

348
00:25:24,993 --> 00:25:28,120
- When and where is the wedding to be?
- Here, as soon as possible.

349
00:25:28,288 --> 00:25:32,750
A whirlwind romance. Splendid! I can
easily postpone my sailing for a week.

350
00:25:32,917 --> 00:25:34,501
This poor child has no mother,

351
00:25:34,669 --> 00:25:37,337
so I shall take responsibility
for all the arrangements.

352
00:25:37,505 --> 00:25:40,090
Trousseau, reception and everything,
and I'll give the bride away.

353
00:25:40,258 --> 00:25:41,258
But our luggage.

354
00:25:41,426 --> 00:25:43,469
Go down and tell the porter
to take everything out of the car.

355
00:25:43,636 --> 00:25:46,055
Just a minute. We're most
grateful, Mrs. Van Hopper,

356
00:25:46,348 --> 00:25:49,642
but I think we'd both prefer to
have it all as quiet as possible.

357
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:51,936
And I couldn't possibly allow you
to change your sailing plans.

358
00:25:52,104 --> 00:25:53,104
- Oh, but...
- No, no, no.

359
00:25:53,564 --> 00:25:55,774
Dear, I'll go down and see that
your luggage is brought back.

360
00:25:55,941 --> 00:25:57,317
Thank you, Maxim.

361
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:02,697
So this is what's been happening
during my illness.

362
00:26:02,865 --> 00:26:04,741
Tennis lessons, my foot.

363
00:26:05,076 --> 00:26:07,285
I suppose I've to hand it to you
for a fast worker.

364
00:26:07,453 --> 00:26:08,661
How did you manage it?

365
00:26:08,829 --> 00:26:11,247
Still waters certainly run deep.

366
00:26:14,835 --> 00:26:18,171
Tell me, have you been doing
anything you shouldn't?

367
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:22,634
- I don't know what you mean.
- Well, never mind.

368
00:26:22,843 --> 00:26:25,929
I always did say that Englishmen
have strange tastes.

369
00:26:26,097 --> 00:26:28,598
You certainly have your work cut out
as mistress of Manderley.

370
00:26:28,766 --> 00:26:31,601
To be perfectly frank with you,
my dear, I can't see you doing it.

371
00:26:31,769 --> 00:26:32,852
You haven't the experience,

372
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:35,939
you haven't the faintest idea
what it means to be a great lady.

373
00:26:38,025 --> 00:26:40,193
Of course you know why
he's marrying you, don't you?

374
00:26:40,361 --> 00:26:42,445
You haven't flattered yourself
that he's in love with you?

375
00:26:42,613 --> 00:26:45,240
Fact is, that empty house got on
his nerves to such an extent,

376
00:26:45,407 --> 00:26:46,616
he nearly went off his head.

377
00:26:46,784 --> 00:26:48,451
He just couldn't go on living alone.

378
00:26:48,619 --> 00:26:51,955
You'd better leave, Mrs. Van Hopper.
You'll miss your train.

379
00:27:00,005 --> 00:27:01,548
Mrs. De Winter.

380
00:27:02,508 --> 00:27:04,968
Goodbye, my dear, and good luck!

381
00:27:32,247 --> 00:27:33,497
Monsieur!

382
00:27:35,834 --> 00:27:36,792
What is he saying?

383
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,711
He says I've forgotten
the proof that we're married.

384
00:27:38,879 --> 00:27:40,296
Good heavens.

385
00:27:49,014 --> 00:27:51,348
Somebody else had the same idea.

386
00:27:57,606 --> 00:27:59,648
- Isn't she sweet?
- Yes.

387
00:28:00,734 --> 00:28:03,694
You'd have liked a bridal veil,
wouldn't you?

388
00:28:04,863 --> 00:28:06,280
Or at least...

389
00:28:13,455 --> 00:28:15,331
Oh, Maxim, how lovely.

390
00:28:16,917 --> 00:28:18,417
How perfectly lovely.

391
00:28:21,671 --> 00:28:23,172
Perfectly lovely.

392
00:28:29,304 --> 00:28:32,264
Welcome home, Mr. De Winter.
Thank you, Smith.

393
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:43,317
- Cold, darling?
- Yes, just a little bit.

394
00:28:45,904 --> 00:28:48,322
There's no need to be frightened,
you know.

395
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:51,283
Just be yourself,
and they'll all adore you.

396
00:28:55,997 --> 00:28:57,665
You don't have to worry
about the house at all.

397
00:28:57,832 --> 00:29:00,669
Mrs. Danvers is the housekeeper.
Just leave it to her.

398
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:10,512
Hello. It's starting to rain.
We'd better hurry up.

399
00:29:13,975 --> 00:29:16,726
Here. Have this. Put it over your head.

400
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:18,603
Thank you.

401
00:29:33,286 --> 00:29:35,495
That's it. That's Manderley.

402
00:30:02,148 --> 00:30:03,982
- Here we are. Frith, everybody well?
- Yes, thank you, sir.

403
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:05,483
Glad to see you home, sir.

404
00:30:05,651 --> 00:30:07,986
- This is Mrs. De Winter, Frith.
- How do you do?

405
00:30:17,371 --> 00:30:19,205
I didn't expect the whole staff
to be in attendance.

406
00:30:19,373 --> 00:30:21,166
Mrs. Danvers' orders, sir.

407
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,002
Oh. Sorry about this.
It won't take long.

408
00:30:33,971 --> 00:30:35,765
This is Mrs. Danvers.

409
00:30:38,435 --> 00:30:43,606
How do you do?

410
00:30:44,024 --> 00:30:45,775
I have everything in readiness for you.

411
00:30:45,942 --> 00:30:49,028
That's very good of you. I...
I didn't expect anything.

412
00:30:54,785 --> 00:30:57,620
- I think we'd like some tea, Frith.
- Ready in the library, sir.

413
00:30:57,996 --> 00:30:59,747
Come along, darling.

414
00:31:13,678 --> 00:31:15,638
Oh, Maxim, come in.

415
00:31:18,058 --> 00:31:19,016
Oh.

416
00:31:19,184 --> 00:31:22,353
- Good evening, Mrs. Danvers.
- Good evening, madam.

417
00:31:30,362 --> 00:31:33,239
- I hope Alice was satisfactory, madam.
- Oh, yes, thank you, perfectly.

418
00:31:33,407 --> 00:31:34,365
She's the parlor maid.

419
00:31:34,533 --> 00:31:36,450
She'll have to look after you
until your own maid arrives.

420
00:31:36,618 --> 00:31:39,620
Oh, but I haven't a maid.
I'm sure Alice will do very nicely.

421
00:31:39,788 --> 00:31:41,914
I'm afraid that would not do
for very long, madam.

422
00:31:42,082 --> 00:31:45,126
It's usual for ladies in your position
to have a personal maid.

423
00:31:46,253 --> 00:31:49,797
I hope you approve the new decoration
of these rooms, madam?

424
00:31:49,965 --> 00:31:52,216
Oh, I didn't know it had been changed.

425
00:31:52,384 --> 00:31:54,009
I hope you haven't been
to too much trouble.

426
00:31:54,177 --> 00:31:56,595
I only followed out
Mr. De Winter's instructions.

427
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,931
Well, what did it look like before?

428
00:31:59,099 --> 00:32:00,558
It had an old paper
and different hangings.

429
00:32:00,725 --> 00:32:03,310
It was never used much
except for occasional visitors.

430
00:32:03,645 --> 00:32:06,105
Oh. Then it wasn't
Mr. De Winter's room originally?

431
00:32:06,273 --> 00:32:09,483
No, madam.
He's never used the east wing before.

432
00:32:10,861 --> 00:32:13,864
Of course, there's no view
of the sea from here.

433
00:32:14,782 --> 00:32:17,117
The only good view of the sea
is from the west wing.

434
00:32:17,285 --> 00:32:20,787
The room's very charming,
and I'm sure I'll be comfortable.

435
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:23,707
If there's anything you want done,
madam, you have only to tell me.

436
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:27,210
I suppose you've been at Manderley
for many years, longer than anyone else.

437
00:32:27,378 --> 00:32:28,712
Not so long as Frith.

438
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,672
He was here when the old gentleman
was living,

439
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,340
when Mr. De Winter was a boy.

440
00:32:32,508 --> 00:32:35,051
Oh, I see.
And you didn't come till after that?

441
00:32:35,636 --> 00:32:38,805
I came here when the first
Mrs. De Winter was a bride.

442
00:32:42,935 --> 00:32:45,979
Mrs. Danvers,
I do hope we'll be friends.

443
00:32:46,856 --> 00:32:48,648
You must be patient with me.

444
00:32:48,816 --> 00:32:52,486
This sort of life is new to me
and I do want to make a success of it,

445
00:32:52,653 --> 00:32:54,362
and make Mr. De Winter happy,

446
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:56,990
so I know I can leave
all the household arrangements to you.

447
00:32:57,158 --> 00:33:00,785
Very well. I hope I shall do everything
to your satisfaction, madam.

448
00:33:00,953 --> 00:33:02,996
I've managed the house
since Mrs. De Winter's death

449
00:33:03,164 --> 00:33:05,540
and Mr. De Winter has never complained.

450
00:33:12,673 --> 00:33:15,008
I think I'll go downstairs now.

451
00:33:50,712 --> 00:33:54,632
That room in the west wing I was telling
you about is there, through that door.

452
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,467
It's not used now.

453
00:33:57,219 --> 00:33:59,887
It's the most beautiful room
in the house,

454
00:34:00,055 --> 00:34:03,182
the only one that looks down
across the lawns to the sea.

455
00:34:05,227 --> 00:34:07,478
It was Mrs. De Winter's room.

456
00:35:26,434 --> 00:35:28,644
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

457
00:35:28,978 --> 00:35:30,979
- You're Mrs. De Winter, aren't you?
- Yes.

458
00:35:31,648 --> 00:35:35,192
My name's Crawley.
I manage the estate for Maxim.

459
00:35:35,777 --> 00:35:37,694
Awfully glad to meet you.

460
00:35:39,572 --> 00:35:42,157
A fearful lot of stuff piled up
while Maxim was away.

461
00:35:42,325 --> 00:35:46,328
Yes, I'm sure there must have been.
I do wish I could help with some of it.

462
00:35:46,663 --> 00:35:49,456
No, no! Frank never allows anybody
to help him.

463
00:35:49,624 --> 00:35:52,250
He's like an old mother hen
with his bills and rents and taxes.

464
00:35:52,418 --> 00:35:54,002
Come on, Frank,
we must go over these estimates.

465
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:55,504
I'll get my papers.

466
00:35:55,672 --> 00:35:57,089
You'll find quantities
of breakfast over there.

467
00:35:57,256 --> 00:35:59,174
But you must eat it all,
or Cook will be mortally offended.

468
00:35:59,342 --> 00:36:00,801
I'll do my best, Maxim.

469
00:36:00,968 --> 00:36:02,427
I have to go over the place
with Frank,

470
00:36:02,595 --> 00:36:04,179
just to make sure that he
hasn't lost any of it.

471
00:36:04,347 --> 00:36:08,058
You'll be all right, won't you?
Getting acquainted with your new home?

472
00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:10,435
Have a look at The Times.
There's a thrilling article

473
00:36:10,603 --> 00:36:12,854
on what's the matter
with English cricket.

474
00:36:13,606 --> 00:36:15,691
Oh, yes...

475
00:36:16,609 --> 00:36:18,652
My sister, Beatrice,
and her husband, Giles Lacy,

476
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:20,195
have invited themselves over for lunch.

477
00:36:20,363 --> 00:36:21,738
- Today?
- Yes.

478
00:36:22,532 --> 00:36:24,908
I suppose the old girl
can't wait to look you over.

479
00:36:25,076 --> 00:36:26,535
You'll find her very direct.

480
00:36:26,703 --> 00:36:29,538
If she doesn't like you, she'll
probably tell you so to your face.

481
00:36:29,914 --> 00:36:32,374
Don't worry, darling, I'll be back
in time to protect you from her.

482
00:36:32,792 --> 00:36:35,210
- Goodbye, darling.
- Goodbye, Maxim.

483
00:36:35,628 --> 00:36:37,212
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

484
00:37:17,296 --> 00:37:19,839
- Good morning, madam.
- Good morning, Frith.

485
00:37:26,013 --> 00:37:28,097
Isn't there anything
I could get for you, madam?

486
00:37:28,265 --> 00:37:31,142
No, thank you, Frith.
I'm really not very hungry.

487
00:37:32,102 --> 00:37:33,436
Thank you.

488
00:37:33,896 --> 00:37:36,773
- The paper, madam.
- Oh, yes. Thank you, Frith.

489
00:37:41,695 --> 00:37:43,029
I slipped.

490
00:37:43,489 --> 00:37:45,114
Thank you, Frith.

491
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,914
- It's big, isn't it?
- Yes, madam, Manderley is a big place.

492
00:37:53,081 --> 00:37:55,208
This was the banquet hall
in the old days.

493
00:37:55,375 --> 00:37:59,128
It's still used on great occasions,
such as a big dinner or a ball.

494
00:37:59,338 --> 00:38:02,131
And the public is admitted here,
you know, once a week.

495
00:38:03,175 --> 00:38:04,592
That's nice.

496
00:38:27,825 --> 00:38:29,075
I beg pardon, madam.

497
00:38:29,243 --> 00:38:32,578
I'm afraid the fire is not usually lit
in the library until the afternoon.

498
00:38:32,746 --> 00:38:34,539
But you'll find one in the morning room.

499
00:38:34,706 --> 00:38:36,833
Of course, if you wish
this fire lit now, madam...

500
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,378
No, Frith, I wouldn't dream of it.

501
00:38:40,755 --> 00:38:42,172
Mrs. De Winter...

502
00:38:43,341 --> 00:38:44,842
I mean, the late Mrs. De Winter

503
00:38:45,009 --> 00:38:47,803
always did her correspondence
and telephoning in the morning room,

504
00:38:47,971 --> 00:38:48,971
after breakfast.

505
00:38:49,138 --> 00:38:50,764
Thank you, Frith.

506
00:38:57,856 --> 00:38:59,481
Is anything wrong, madam?

507
00:38:59,649 --> 00:39:02,025
Oh, no. Which way is the morning room?

508
00:39:02,193 --> 00:39:04,278
Oh, it's that door there, on the left.

509
00:39:04,445 --> 00:39:05,779
Oh, yes, thank you.

510
00:40:00,209 --> 00:40:03,170
Mrs. De Winter?
Oh, I'm afraid you've made a mistake.

511
00:40:03,338 --> 00:40:06,214
Mrs. De Winter's been dead
for over a year.

512
00:40:07,425 --> 00:40:08,800
Oh, I mean...

513
00:40:12,096 --> 00:40:13,096
Oh.

514
00:40:13,973 --> 00:40:15,975
That was the house telephone, madam.

515
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:19,520
Probably the head gardener
wishing instructions.

516
00:40:20,689 --> 00:40:22,899
Did you want to see me, Mrs. Danvers?

517
00:40:23,108 --> 00:40:25,568
Mr. De Winter informed me that
his sister, Mrs. Lacy, and Major Lacy

518
00:40:25,736 --> 00:40:27,278
are expected for luncheon.

519
00:40:27,613 --> 00:40:29,489
I'd like to know
if you approve of the menu.

520
00:40:29,657 --> 00:40:33,493
Oh, well, I'm sure it's very suitable,
very nice indeed.

521
00:40:33,661 --> 00:40:36,412
You will notice, madam, that I've
left a blank space for the sauce.

522
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:39,374
Mrs. De Winter was most particular
about sauces.

523
00:40:39,959 --> 00:40:43,419
Let's have whatever you think
that Mrs. De Winter would have ordered.

524
00:40:43,587 --> 00:40:45,296
Thank you, madam.

525
00:40:45,965 --> 00:40:48,967
When you've finished your letters,
Robert will take them to the post.

526
00:40:49,134 --> 00:40:50,468
My... My letters?

527
00:40:52,304 --> 00:40:54,973
Oh, yes, of course.
Thank you, Mrs. Danvers.

528
00:41:52,782 --> 00:41:54,908
How are you, Frith?
- Good morning, Mrs. Lacy.

529
00:41:55,076 --> 00:41:55,993
Where's Mr. De Winter?

530
00:41:56,161 --> 00:41:58,704
I believe he went down
to the farm with Mr. Crawley.

531
00:41:58,872 --> 00:42:02,416
How tiresome of him not to
be here when we arrive, and how typical.

532
00:42:14,888 --> 00:42:17,514
I must say old Danvers
keeps the house looking lovely.

533
00:42:17,682 --> 00:42:20,559
She's certainly learned that trick
of arranging flowers from Rebecca.

534
00:42:20,727 --> 00:42:22,561
I wonder how she likes it now,

535
00:42:22,729 --> 00:42:24,938
being ordered about
by an ex-chorus girl.

536
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:26,732
Now, where on Earth
did you get the idea

537
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:27,900
she's an ex-chorus girl?

538
00:42:28,068 --> 00:42:30,069
He picked her up in the South of France,
didn't he?

539
00:42:30,236 --> 00:42:31,236
What if he did?

540
00:42:31,738 --> 00:42:34,073
Well, I mean to say, there you are.

541
00:42:40,413 --> 00:42:42,414
How do you do? I'm Maxim's wife.

542
00:42:42,582 --> 00:42:43,916
How do you do?

543
00:42:44,084 --> 00:42:46,668
Well, I must say you're quite different
from what I expected.

544
00:42:46,836 --> 00:42:49,296
Don't be so silly.
She's exactly what I told you she'd be.

545
00:42:49,464 --> 00:42:51,423
Well, how do you like Manderley?

546
00:42:51,591 --> 00:42:52,758
It's very beautiful, isn't it?

547
00:42:52,926 --> 00:42:55,094
And how do you get along
with Mrs. Danvers?

548
00:42:55,261 --> 00:42:56,261
Well, I...

549
00:42:56,429 --> 00:42:58,764
I've never met anyone
quite like her before.

550
00:42:58,932 --> 00:42:59,848
You mean, she scares you.

551
00:43:00,016 --> 00:43:02,101
She's not exactly an oil painting,
is she?

552
00:43:02,477 --> 00:43:05,187
Giles, you're very much in the way here.
Go somewhere else.

553
00:43:05,355 --> 00:43:07,356
Well, I'll try and find Maxim, shall I?

554
00:43:07,649 --> 00:43:08,816
Giles.

555
00:43:10,735 --> 00:43:13,362
I didn't mean to say anything
against Mrs. Danvers.

556
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:15,531
Oh, there's no need for you
to be frightened of her,

557
00:43:15,698 --> 00:43:18,700
but I shouldn't have any more
to do with her than you can help.

558
00:43:18,868 --> 00:43:21,578
- Shall we sit down?
- Yes. Yes, please.

559
00:43:22,664 --> 00:43:25,290
You see, she's bound to be
insanely jealous at first

560
00:43:25,458 --> 00:43:27,710
and she must resent you bitterly.

561
00:43:27,878 --> 00:43:29,087
But why should she?

562
00:43:29,255 --> 00:43:30,755
Don't you know?

563
00:43:30,923 --> 00:43:33,466
I should have thought
Maxim would have told you.

564
00:43:33,634 --> 00:43:35,760
She simply adored Rebecca.

565
00:43:45,855 --> 00:43:47,730
- How are you, Robert?
- Quite well, thank you, madam.

566
00:43:47,898 --> 00:43:50,817
- Still having trouble with your teeth?
- Unfortunately, yes, madam.

567
00:43:50,985 --> 00:43:52,944
You must have them out, all of them.

568
00:43:53,654 --> 00:43:56,030
- Wretched nuisances, teeth.
- Thank you, madam.

569
00:43:56,198 --> 00:43:57,323
What a plateful.

570
00:43:57,491 --> 00:43:58,491
Do you hunt?

571
00:43:58,659 --> 00:44:00,785
No, I don't.
I'm afraid I don't even ride.

572
00:44:00,953 --> 00:44:02,829
You have to ride down here, we all do.

573
00:44:03,497 --> 00:44:06,332
Which do you ride,
sidesaddle or astride?

574
00:44:06,542 --> 00:44:08,334
Well, of course, I forgot.
You don't, do you?

575
00:44:08,836 --> 00:44:11,045
You must.
Nothing else to do around here.

576
00:44:11,213 --> 00:44:13,673
Maxim, when are you going to have
parties here again, like the old days?

577
00:44:13,841 --> 00:44:15,049
I haven't thought about it.

578
00:44:15,217 --> 00:44:18,261
- But everyone's dying to see you and...
- Yes, I bet they are.

579
00:44:18,429 --> 00:44:21,848
Why don't you have
the masquerade ball again this summer?

580
00:44:22,099 --> 00:44:23,892
My dear, are you fond of dancing?

581
00:44:24,059 --> 00:44:26,227
I love it, but I'm not very good at it.

582
00:44:26,395 --> 00:44:27,645
Do you rumba?

583
00:44:27,813 --> 00:44:29,522
- Never tried.
- You must teach me.

584
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:32,483
Actually, I'm trying to find out
exactly what your wife does do.

585
00:44:33,319 --> 00:44:34,444
She sketches a little.

586
00:44:34,612 --> 00:44:35,737
Sketches.

587
00:44:35,905 --> 00:44:38,865
Not this modern stuff, I hope, you know,
portrait of a lampshade upside down

588
00:44:39,033 --> 00:44:40,909
to represent a soul in torment.

589
00:44:41,368 --> 00:44:42,702
Don't sail, do you?

590
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:43,870
No, I don't.

591
00:44:44,038 --> 00:44:45,955
Thank goodness for that.

592
00:44:47,082 --> 00:44:48,124
Huh?

593
00:44:58,719 --> 00:45:01,554
You're very much in love with Maxim,
aren't you?

594
00:45:01,764 --> 00:45:03,432
Yes, I can see you are.

595
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,936
Don't mind my saying so, but why
don't you do something about your hair?

596
00:45:07,103 --> 00:45:10,231
Why don't you have it cut
or sweep it back behind your ears?

597
00:45:12,359 --> 00:45:14,235
Oh, no, that's worse.

598
00:45:14,444 --> 00:45:16,904
What does Maxim say about it?
Does he like it like that?

599
00:45:17,072 --> 00:45:18,614
Well, he never mentions it.

600
00:45:18,782 --> 00:45:20,407
Oh, well, don't go by me.

601
00:45:20,575 --> 00:45:23,327
I can see by the way you dress
you don't care a hoot how you look.

602
00:45:23,495 --> 00:45:27,456
But I wonder Maxim hasn't been at you.
He's so particular about clothes.

603
00:45:27,707 --> 00:45:30,209
I don't think he ever notices
what I wear.

604
00:45:30,377 --> 00:45:32,795
Oh. He must have changed a lot, then.

605
00:45:36,341 --> 00:45:38,842
You mustn't worry
about old Maxim and his moods.

606
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:41,720
One never knows what goes on
in that quiet mind of his.

607
00:45:41,888 --> 00:45:44,598
Often, he gets into a terrible rage,
and when he does...

608
00:45:46,142 --> 00:45:47,685
I don't suppose he'll
lose his temper with you.

609
00:45:47,852 --> 00:45:49,436
You seem such a placid little thing.

610
00:45:49,604 --> 00:45:51,772
Come on, old girl. We've got to go
on the first tee at 3:00.

611
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:53,107
All right, I'm coming.

612
00:45:53,316 --> 00:45:55,276
Well, goodbye, Maxim, old boy.

613
00:45:55,443 --> 00:45:57,695
Goodbye, Giles.
Thanks for coming, old boy.

614
00:45:58,029 --> 00:46:01,156
Goodbye, my dear. Forgive me for asking
you so many rude questions.

615
00:46:01,324 --> 00:46:03,242
We both really hope
you'll be very happy.

616
00:46:03,702 --> 00:46:05,828
Thank you, Beatrice,
thank you very much.

617
00:46:06,162 --> 00:46:08,455
And I must congratulate you
upon the way Maxim looks.

618
00:46:08,623 --> 00:46:10,958
We were very worried about him
this time last year.

619
00:46:11,126 --> 00:46:14,295
But then, of course,
you know the whole story.

620
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:17,965
Goodbye, Beatrice.
- Goodbye, old boy.

621
00:46:23,138 --> 00:46:24,263
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

622
00:46:25,724 --> 00:46:27,141
Well, thank heavens they've gone.

623
00:46:27,309 --> 00:46:28,475
Now we can have a walk about the place.

624
00:46:28,643 --> 00:46:31,145
Looks as though we might have a shower.
But you won't mind that, will you?

625
00:46:31,313 --> 00:46:32,688
No, but wait a minute.
I'll go upstairs and get a coat.

626
00:46:32,856 --> 00:46:35,274
There's a heap of mackintoshes
in the flower room. Robert?

627
00:46:35,483 --> 00:46:38,152
Run and get a coat from the flower room
for Mrs. De Winter, will you?

628
00:46:38,403 --> 00:46:39,653
What do you think of Beatrice?

629
00:46:39,822 --> 00:46:41,781
Oh, I liked her very much,
but she kept saying

630
00:46:41,949 --> 00:46:43,700
that I was quite different
from what she expected.

631
00:46:43,868 --> 00:46:44,909
What the devil did she expect?

632
00:46:45,077 --> 00:46:48,747
Oh, someone smarter
and more sophisticated, I'm afraid.

633
00:46:50,166 --> 00:46:51,916
Do you like my hair?

634
00:46:52,168 --> 00:46:54,794
Your hair? Yes, of course I do.
What's the matter with it?

635
00:46:54,962 --> 00:46:57,005
Oh, I don't know. I just wondered.

636
00:46:57,715 --> 00:46:59,382
How funny you are.

637
00:46:59,717 --> 00:47:00,717
Thank you.

638
00:47:01,844 --> 00:47:03,803
- Do I have to put it on?
- Yes, certainly, certainly, certainly.

639
00:47:03,971 --> 00:47:05,430
You can't be too careful with children.

640
00:47:05,598 --> 00:47:07,932
Come on, Jasper.
Come and take some of that fat off.

641
00:47:17,985 --> 00:47:20,278
Jasper! Here. Not that way! Come here!

642
00:47:22,698 --> 00:47:24,282
Where does that lead to?

643
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:26,993
Oh, it leads to a little cove
where we used to keep a boat.

644
00:47:27,161 --> 00:47:28,203
Oh, let's go down there.

645
00:47:28,371 --> 00:47:30,497
Well, no. It's a perfectly dull,
uninteresting stretch of sand,

646
00:47:30,664 --> 00:47:33,124
- just like any other.
- Oh, please.

647
00:47:33,292 --> 00:47:37,712
Well, all right. We'll walk down
and take a look if you really want to.

648
00:47:45,221 --> 00:47:47,847
That's Jasper.
There must be something wrong.

649
00:47:48,015 --> 00:47:50,100
- Perhaps he's hurt himself.
- No, he's all right, leave him alone.

650
00:47:50,267 --> 00:47:51,226
Don't you think I'd better go and see?

651
00:47:51,394 --> 00:47:53,311
Don't bother about him, I tell you,
he can't come to any harm.

652
00:47:53,479 --> 00:47:55,355
He'll find his own way back!

653
00:48:03,531 --> 00:48:06,199
Jasper! Jasper?

654
00:48:06,909 --> 00:48:08,576
Oh, there you are.

655
00:48:14,875 --> 00:48:17,878
What do you want in there, Jasper?
Come on. Come on home. Let's go home.

656
00:48:18,046 --> 00:48:19,130
Jasper...

657
00:48:30,142 --> 00:48:31,142
Oh.

658
00:48:32,394 --> 00:48:35,104
I didn't know that there was anybody...

659
00:48:35,272 --> 00:48:36,897
I know that dog.

660
00:48:37,065 --> 00:48:38,774
He comes from the house.

661
00:48:38,942 --> 00:48:40,276
He ain't yours.

662
00:48:40,444 --> 00:48:42,611
No. He's Mr. De Winter's dog.

663
00:48:43,947 --> 00:48:46,657
Have you anything I could tie him with?

664
00:49:19,774 --> 00:49:21,066
Come on, Jasper.

665
00:49:21,234 --> 00:49:24,528
You won't tell anyone
you saw me in there, will you?

666
00:49:24,696 --> 00:49:26,489
Don't you belong on the estate?

667
00:49:26,656 --> 00:49:28,365
I weren't doing nothing.

668
00:49:28,533 --> 00:49:30,993
I was just putting me shells away.

669
00:49:31,161 --> 00:49:33,579
She's gone in the sea, ain't she?

670
00:49:34,247 --> 00:49:36,582
She'll never come back no more.

671
00:49:37,334 --> 00:49:39,502
No. She'll never come back.

672
00:49:40,879 --> 00:49:42,505
Come on, Jasper.

673
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:03,735
Maxim! What's the matter?

674
00:50:04,153 --> 00:50:05,320
Maxim!

675
00:50:08,491 --> 00:50:10,951
I'm sorry I was such a time,
but I had to find a rope for Jasper.

676
00:50:11,118 --> 00:50:12,953
Hurry up, Jasper, for heaven's sake.

677
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:16,373
Please wait for me. Maxim, what is it?
You look so angry.

678
00:50:16,541 --> 00:50:18,750
You knew I didn't want you to go there,
but you deliberately went.

679
00:50:18,918 --> 00:50:21,920
Why not? There was only a cottage
down there and a strange man who...

680
00:50:22,088 --> 00:50:24,381
- You didn't go in the cottage, did you?
- Yes, the door was...

681
00:50:24,549 --> 00:50:26,007
- Don't go there again, do you hear?
- Well, why not?

682
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:27,592
Because I hate the place.
And if you had my memories,

683
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,553
you wouldn't go there or talk about it
or even think about it.

684
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:31,846
What's the matter?
Oh, I'm sorry, please.

685
00:50:32,723 --> 00:50:34,432
We should have stayed away.

686
00:50:35,017 --> 00:50:37,936
We should never have come back
to Manderley.

687
00:50:38,938 --> 00:50:40,855
Oh, what a fool I was.

688
00:50:43,025 --> 00:50:45,860
I've made you unhappy.
Somehow, I've hurt you.

689
00:50:46,362 --> 00:50:48,697
Oh, I can't bear to see you like this

690
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:51,366
because I love you so much.

691
00:50:53,035 --> 00:50:57,414
Do you?

692
00:50:59,417 --> 00:51:01,293
I've made you cry.

693
00:51:01,752 --> 00:51:03,086
Forgive me.

694
00:51:06,465 --> 00:51:09,843
I sometimes seem to fly off the handle
for no reason at all.

695
00:51:12,471 --> 00:51:13,722
Don't I?

696
00:51:15,266 --> 00:51:19,519
Come, we'll go home and have some tea
and forget all about it.

697
00:51:19,687 --> 00:51:22,022
Yes, let's forget all about it.

698
00:51:22,481 --> 00:51:24,524
Here, let me have Jasper.

699
00:51:53,930 --> 00:51:56,766
- Hello. Come in.
- Oh, please don't get up, Mr. Crawley.

700
00:51:56,933 --> 00:51:59,310
I was just wondering
if you meant what you said the other day

701
00:51:59,478 --> 00:52:02,605
- about showing me the run of things.
- Of course I did.

702
00:52:03,148 --> 00:52:04,398
What are you doing now?

703
00:52:04,566 --> 00:52:05,483
Notifying all the tenants

704
00:52:05,651 --> 00:52:08,444
that in celebration of Maxim's return
with his bride,

705
00:52:08,612 --> 00:52:09,904
this week's rent will be free.

706
00:52:10,072 --> 00:52:11,030
Oh, is that Maxim's idea?

707
00:52:11,198 --> 00:52:13,824
Oh, yes, all the servants get
an extra week's wages, too.

708
00:52:13,992 --> 00:52:15,660
Oh, he didn't tell me.

709
00:52:16,495 --> 00:52:19,163
Can't I help you?
I could at least lick the stamps.

710
00:52:19,331 --> 00:52:22,124
Well, that's terribly nice of you.
Won't you sit down?

711
00:52:22,292 --> 00:52:23,834
Yes, thank you.

712
00:52:29,341 --> 00:52:32,426
I was down at the cottage on the beach
the other day.

713
00:52:32,803 --> 00:52:35,346
There was a man there,
a queer sort of person.

714
00:52:35,514 --> 00:52:37,014
Jasper kept barking at him.

715
00:52:37,182 --> 00:52:39,016
Oh, yes, it must have been Ben.

716
00:52:39,184 --> 00:52:41,227
Excuse me. He's quite harmless.

717
00:52:41,395 --> 00:52:43,604
We give him odd jobs now and then.

718
00:52:44,022 --> 00:52:46,691
That cottage bay
seemed to be going to rack and ruin.

719
00:52:46,858 --> 00:52:48,984
Why isn't something done about it?

720
00:52:49,152 --> 00:52:52,780
I think if Maxim wanted anything
done about it, he'd tell me.

721
00:52:54,116 --> 00:52:57,034
Are those all Rebecca's things
down there?

722
00:52:58,078 --> 00:52:59,161
Yes.

723
00:52:59,871 --> 00:53:01,372
Yes, they are.

724
00:53:02,374 --> 00:53:04,542
What did she use the cottage for?

725
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:06,586
The boat used to be moored near there.

726
00:53:06,754 --> 00:53:08,672
What boat? What happened to it?

727
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:11,842
Was that the boat she was sailing in
when she was drowned?

728
00:53:13,761 --> 00:53:18,098
Yes. It capsized and sank.
She was washed overboard.

729
00:53:18,266 --> 00:53:20,767
Wasn't she afraid to go out
like that alone?

730
00:53:21,853 --> 00:53:24,146
She wasn't afraid of anything.

731
00:53:27,233 --> 00:53:29,234
Where did they find her?

732
00:53:31,446 --> 00:53:32,696
Near Edgecombe,

733
00:53:32,864 --> 00:53:35,657
about 40 miles up channel
about two months afterwards.

734
00:53:36,325 --> 00:53:38,618
Maxim went up to identify her.

735
00:53:39,328 --> 00:53:41,246
It was horrible for him.

736
00:53:41,581 --> 00:53:43,457
Yes, it must have been.

737
00:53:47,336 --> 00:53:51,256
Mr. Crawley, please don't think me
morbidly curious. It isn't that. It's...

738
00:53:51,424 --> 00:53:54,217
It's just that I feel
at such a disadvantage.

739
00:53:54,427 --> 00:53:58,221
All the time, whenever I meet anyone,
Maxim's sister or even the servants,

740
00:53:58,389 --> 00:54:00,098
I know they're all thinking
the same thing,

741
00:54:00,266 --> 00:54:03,810
that they're all comparing me with her,
with Rebecca.

742
00:54:03,978 --> 00:54:05,771
You mustn't think that.

743
00:54:05,938 --> 00:54:08,398
I can't tell you how glad I am
that you married Maxim.

744
00:54:08,566 --> 00:54:10,776
It's going to make
all the difference to his life.

745
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:13,278
From my point of view,
it's very refreshing

746
00:54:13,446 --> 00:54:14,988
to find someone like yourself,

747
00:54:15,156 --> 00:54:18,450
who's not entirely in tune,
shall we say, with Manderley.

748
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:21,119
That's very sweet of you.

749
00:54:21,454 --> 00:54:23,955
I daresay I've been stupid,

750
00:54:24,248 --> 00:54:28,627
but every day I realize
the things she had that I lack.

751
00:54:29,128 --> 00:54:31,922
Beauty and wit and intelligence,

752
00:54:32,089 --> 00:54:35,258
and all the things
that are so important in a woman.

753
00:54:35,426 --> 00:54:38,053
You have qualities
that are just as important,

754
00:54:38,221 --> 00:54:40,138
more important, if I may say so.

755
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:43,309
Kindliness and sincerity,

756
00:54:43,685 --> 00:54:46,020
and if you'll forgive me, modesty,

757
00:54:46,188 --> 00:54:49,816
mean more to a husband than all
the wit and beauty in the world.

758
00:54:50,317 --> 00:54:52,401
We, none of us want to live in the past,

759
00:54:52,569 --> 00:54:54,320
Maxim least of all.

760
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:58,199
It's up to you, you know,
to lead us away from it.

761
00:54:59,076 --> 00:54:59,992
Right.

762
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:02,870
I promise you I won't
bring this up again,

763
00:55:03,163 --> 00:55:05,331
but before we end this conversation,

764
00:55:05,499 --> 00:55:08,000
would you answer
just one more question?

765
00:55:08,377 --> 00:55:12,505
If it's something I'm able to answer,
I'll do my best.

766
00:55:13,841 --> 00:55:16,592
Tell me, what was Rebecca really like?

767
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:27,937
I suppose...

768
00:55:29,356 --> 00:55:33,067
I suppose she was the most
beautiful creature I ever saw.

769
00:56:05,517 --> 00:56:06,893
Good evening, Maxim.

770
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:09,478
Hello. The films of the honeymoon
have arrived at last.

771
00:56:09,646 --> 00:56:11,939
Do we have time, do you think,
before dinner?

772
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:18,655
What on Earth have you done to yourself?

773
00:56:18,823 --> 00:56:21,241
Oh, nothing. I just ordered a new dress
from London.

774
00:56:21,409 --> 00:56:22,576
I hope you don't mind.

775
00:56:22,744 --> 00:56:26,580
Oh, no, no. Only, do you think
that sort of thing's right for you?

776
00:56:26,748 --> 00:56:30,250
- It doesn't seem your type at all.
- I thought you'd like it.

777
00:56:30,418 --> 00:56:33,045
And what have you done to your hair?

778
00:56:33,588 --> 00:56:34,922
Oh, I see.

779
00:56:35,381 --> 00:56:37,132
Dear, oh, dear. I'm sorry.

780
00:56:37,967 --> 00:56:39,885
You look lovely, lovely.

781
00:56:40,053 --> 00:56:42,304
It's very nice, for a change.

782
00:56:45,183 --> 00:56:48,602
- Shall we see these pictures?
- Yes. I'd love to see them.

783
00:56:57,236 --> 00:56:59,738
Look now, look at that.

784
00:56:59,906 --> 00:57:01,156
Wasn't it wonderful, darling?

785
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:20,000
https://t.me/RickyChannel

786
00:57:01,324 --> 00:57:02,366
Can't we go back there someday?

787
00:57:02,533 --> 00:57:04,743
Yes, of course. Of course.
Look at you.

788
00:57:04,911 --> 00:57:08,372
Won't our grandchildren be delighted
when they see how lovely you were?

789
00:57:08,539 --> 00:57:09,623
Oh, look at you.

790
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:13,794
Oh, I like that.

791
00:57:14,754 --> 00:57:15,754
Look at that.

792
00:57:16,255 --> 00:57:17,464
Yes, very nice.

793
00:57:17,966 --> 00:57:19,257
- Remember that?
Yes.

794
00:57:19,425 --> 00:57:21,677
I wish our honeymoon could have
lasted forever, Maxim.

795
00:57:21,844 --> 00:57:23,595
Dash it, look.

796
00:57:24,973 --> 00:57:26,306
Hang it.

797
00:57:26,808 --> 00:57:29,309
I've threaded it up wrong as usual
or something.

798
00:57:32,981 --> 00:57:33,939
Yes, Frith. What is it?

799
00:57:34,107 --> 00:57:36,316
Excuse me, sir.
May I have a word with you?

800
00:57:37,819 --> 00:57:39,987
Yes. Come in.

801
00:57:40,154 --> 00:57:42,155
It's about Robert, sir.

802
00:57:42,657 --> 00:57:44,783
There's been a slight unpleasantness
between him and Mrs. Danvers.

803
00:57:44,951 --> 00:57:45,909
Oh, dear.

804
00:57:46,077 --> 00:57:48,286
- Robert is very upset.
- This is trouble.

805
00:57:48,454 --> 00:57:49,413
What is it?

806
00:57:49,580 --> 00:57:52,874
It appears that Mrs. Danvers has accused
Robert of stealing a valuable ornament

807
00:57:53,042 --> 00:57:54,001
from the morning room.

808
00:57:54,168 --> 00:57:57,213
Robert denies the accusation
most emphatically, sir.

809
00:57:58,841 --> 00:58:01,342
- What was the thing, anyway?
- China cupid, sir.

810
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:03,511
Oh, dear.
That's one of our treasures, isn't it?

811
00:58:03,887 --> 00:58:06,264
Well, tell Mrs. Danvers
to get to the bottom of it somehow.

812
00:58:06,432 --> 00:58:09,100
- Tell her I'm sure it wasn't Robert.
- Very good, sir.

813
00:58:09,268 --> 00:58:12,478
Why do they come to me with these
things? That's your job, sweetheart.

814
00:58:12,688 --> 00:58:16,024
Maxim, I wanted to tell you,
but I forgot.

815
00:58:18,110 --> 00:58:20,862
The fact is, I broke the china cupid.

816
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:21,946
You broke it?

817
00:58:22,114 --> 00:58:25,199
Now, why on Earth didn't you say
something about it when Frith was here?

818
00:58:25,367 --> 00:58:27,368
I don't know. I didn't like to.

819
00:58:27,536 --> 00:58:29,287
I was afraid he'd think me a fool.

820
00:58:29,455 --> 00:58:31,039
He'll think you much more
of a fool now.

821
00:58:31,206 --> 00:58:33,041
You'll have to explain to him
and Mrs. Danvers.

822
00:58:33,208 --> 00:58:35,001
Oh, no, Maxim.
You do it. I'll go upstairs.

823
00:58:35,169 --> 00:58:36,377
Don't be such a little idiot, darling.

824
00:58:36,545 --> 00:58:38,880
Anybody would think
you were afraid of them.

825
00:58:40,257 --> 00:58:41,257
It's all a mistake, Mrs. Danvers.

826
00:58:41,425 --> 00:58:42,884
Apparently, Mrs. De Winter
broke the cupid herself

827
00:58:43,052 --> 00:58:45,553
and forgot to say anything about it.

828
00:58:45,721 --> 00:58:49,932
I'm so sorry. I never thought
that I'd get Robert into trouble.

829
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:52,435
Is it possible to repair
the ornament, madam?

830
00:58:52,853 --> 00:58:55,772
No, I'm afraid it isn't.
It smashed into pieces.

831
00:58:56,565 --> 00:58:58,983
What did you do with the pieces?

832
00:59:00,110 --> 00:59:03,905
Well, I put them at the back of one
of the drawers in the writing desk.

833
00:59:04,073 --> 00:59:06,032
Well, it looks as though
Mrs. De Winter was afraid

834
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:08,451
you were going to put her in prison,
doesn't it, Mrs. Danvers?

835
00:59:08,619 --> 00:59:10,745
Well, never mind.
Do what you can to find the pieces.

836
00:59:10,913 --> 00:59:14,165
See if they can be mended, and
above all, tell Robert to dry his tears.

837
00:59:14,333 --> 00:59:17,794
I shall apologize to Robert, of course.
Perhaps if such a thing happens again,

838
00:59:17,961 --> 00:59:19,545
Mrs. De Winter will tell me personally.

839
00:59:19,713 --> 00:59:21,506
Yes, yes, all right.
Thank you, Mrs. Danvers.

840
00:59:27,137 --> 00:59:29,847
Well, I suppose that clip
will hold all right. I don't know.

841
00:59:35,271 --> 00:59:38,732
I'm awfully sorry,
darling. It was very careless of me.

842
00:59:39,234 --> 00:59:41,902
- Mrs. Danvers must be furious with me.
- Hang Mrs. Danvers.

843
00:59:42,070 --> 00:59:44,196
Why on Earth
should you be frightened of her?

844
00:59:44,364 --> 00:59:46,740
You behave more like an upstairs maid
or something,

845
00:59:46,908 --> 00:59:50,119
- not the mistress of the house at all.
- Yes, I know I do.

846
00:59:50,703 --> 00:59:52,746
But I feel so uncomfortable.

847
00:59:52,914 --> 00:59:56,875
I try my best every day, but it's very
difficult with people looking me

848
00:59:57,043 --> 01:00:00,045
up and down as if I were a prize cow.

849
01:00:00,213 --> 01:00:01,839
What does it matter if they do?
You must remember

850
01:00:02,006 --> 01:00:06,009
that life at Manderley is the only thing
that interests anybody down here.

851
01:00:06,177 --> 01:00:08,971
What a slap in the eye
I must have been to them, then.

852
01:00:09,389 --> 01:00:11,431
I suppose that's why you married me,

853
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:15,102
because you knew I was dull and gauche
and inexperienced,

854
01:00:15,270 --> 01:00:17,729
and there'd never be
any gossip about me.

855
01:00:17,897 --> 01:00:20,816
Gossip? What do you mean?

856
01:00:21,442 --> 01:00:24,444
I don't know.
I just said it for something to say.

857
01:00:24,612 --> 01:00:27,239
Don't look at me like that. Maxim.

858
01:00:28,366 --> 01:00:30,909
What's the matter? What have I said?

859
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:39,459
Wasn't a very attractive thing
to say, was it?

860
01:00:39,627 --> 01:00:43,213
No. It was rude, hateful.

861
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:51,471
I wonder if I did a very selfish thing
in marrying you.

862
01:00:51,639 --> 01:00:53,182
How do you mean?

863
01:00:53,349 --> 01:00:55,851
I'm not much of a companion
to you, am I?

864
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:59,354
You don't get much fun, do you?

865
01:01:00,190 --> 01:01:03,567
You ought to have married a boy,
someone of your own age.

866
01:01:03,818 --> 01:01:07,029
Maxim, why do you say this?
Of course we're companions.

867
01:01:07,405 --> 01:01:10,742
Are we? I don't know.

868
01:01:12,203 --> 01:01:14,245
- I'm very difficult to live with.
- No, you're not difficult.

869
01:01:14,413 --> 01:01:15,872
You're easy, very easy.

870
01:01:16,582 --> 01:01:19,792
Our marriage is a success,
isn't it, a great success?

871
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:22,712
We're happy, aren't we? Terribly happy?

872
01:01:30,888 --> 01:01:33,264
If you don't think we are happy,

873
01:01:33,891 --> 01:01:36,976
it would be much better
if you didn't pretend.

874
01:01:37,811 --> 01:01:39,270
I'll go away.

875
01:01:42,775 --> 01:01:44,734
Why don't you answer me?

876
01:01:47,071 --> 01:01:48,821
How can I answer you

877
01:01:49,448 --> 01:01:52,075
when I don't know the answer myself?

878
01:01:53,702 --> 01:01:56,871
If you say we're happy,
let's leave it at that.

879
01:01:57,373 --> 01:02:00,375
Happiness is something
I know nothing about.

880
01:02:05,798 --> 01:02:09,259
Oh, look. There's the one
when I left the camera

881
01:02:09,426 --> 01:02:11,761
running on the tripod, remember?

882
01:03:04,316 --> 01:03:07,234
Pardon me, madam.
Is there anything I can do for you?

883
01:03:07,402 --> 01:03:09,570
I'm all right, Hilda.
Thank you very much.

884
01:03:09,904 --> 01:03:12,823
I'll bring the sandwiches
immediately, madam.

885
01:03:37,515 --> 01:03:39,433
- Hilda.
- Yes, madam?

886
01:03:40,018 --> 01:03:44,063
The west wing.
Nobody ever uses it anymore, do they?

887
01:03:44,230 --> 01:03:47,524
No, madam.
Not since the death of Mrs. De Winter.

888
01:04:09,672 --> 01:04:11,590
Come along, Mr. Jack,
or someone may see you.

889
01:04:11,758 --> 01:04:14,551
Well, Danny, old harpy,
it's been good to see you again.

890
01:04:14,886 --> 01:04:17,388
I've been simply breathless
to pick up all the news.

891
01:04:18,723 --> 01:04:20,683
I really don't think it's
wise for you to come here, Mr. Jack.

892
01:04:20,851 --> 01:04:21,768
Jasper, come here.

893
01:04:21,936 --> 01:04:24,437
Oh, nonsense, nonsense.
It's just like coming back home.

894
01:04:24,605 --> 01:04:25,563
Quiet, Mr. Jack.

895
01:04:25,731 --> 01:04:28,233
Yes. We must be careful
not to shock Cinderella, mustn't we?

896
01:04:28,401 --> 01:04:29,901
She's in the morning room.

897
01:04:30,069 --> 01:04:32,070
If you leave through the garden door,
she won't see you.

898
01:04:32,238 --> 01:04:34,239
I must say,
I feel a little like the poor relation,

899
01:04:34,407 --> 01:04:36,574
sneaking around through back doors.

900
01:04:37,326 --> 01:04:38,827
Well, toodle-oo, Danny.

901
01:04:38,994 --> 01:04:41,079
Goodbye, Mr. Jack,
and please be careful.

902
01:04:43,541 --> 01:04:45,166
Jasper, be quiet.

903
01:04:47,753 --> 01:04:49,254
Looking for me?

904
01:04:49,630 --> 01:04:51,464
- I didn't make you jump, did I?
- No.

905
01:04:51,674 --> 01:04:54,592
Of course not.
I didn't quite know who it was.

906
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:59,013
Yes. You're pleased to see me,
aren't you, old boy?

907
01:04:59,181 --> 01:05:02,642
I'm glad there's someone in the family
to welcome me back to Manderley.

908
01:05:04,103 --> 01:05:07,272
And how is dear old Max?

909
01:05:08,274 --> 01:05:10,108
Very well, thank you.

910
01:05:10,609 --> 01:05:13,945
I hear he went up to London,
left his little bride all alone.

911
01:05:14,113 --> 01:05:15,655
It's too bad.

912
01:05:15,948 --> 01:05:19,784
Isn't he rather afraid that somebody
might come down and carry you off?

913
01:05:21,245 --> 01:05:24,456
Danny, all your precautions
were in vain.

914
01:05:24,623 --> 01:05:27,959
The mistress of the house
was hiding behind the door.

915
01:05:30,004 --> 01:05:33,298
Oh. What about presenting me
to the bride?

916
01:05:33,466 --> 01:05:35,592
This is Mr. Favell, madam.

917
01:05:36,343 --> 01:05:40,638
How do you do?

918
01:05:43,309 --> 01:05:46,853
- Won't you have some tea or something?
- Now, isn't that a charming invitation?

919
01:05:47,021 --> 01:05:49,939
I've been asked to tea, Danny,
and I've a good mind to accept.

920
01:05:51,150 --> 01:05:54,819
Oh, well, perhaps you're right. Pity,
just when we were getting on so nicely.

921
01:05:55,154 --> 01:05:58,407
We mustn't lead the young bride astray,
must we, Jasper?

922
01:05:59,284 --> 01:06:01,702
Goodbye. It's been fun meeting you.

923
01:06:01,912 --> 01:06:05,789
Oh, and by the way, it would be
very decent of you if you didn't mention

924
01:06:05,957 --> 01:06:08,167
this little visit
to your revered husband.

925
01:06:08,502 --> 01:06:10,961
He doesn't exactly approve of me.

926
01:06:11,588 --> 01:06:14,256
- Very well.
- That's very sporting of you.

927
01:06:14,758 --> 01:06:17,968
I wish I had a young bride of
three months waiting for me at home.

928
01:06:18,678 --> 01:06:21,472
I'm just a lonely old bachelor.

929
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:23,182
Fare thee well.

930
01:06:24,518 --> 01:06:27,269
Oh, and I know what was wrong
with that introduction.

931
01:06:27,437 --> 01:06:29,188
Danny didn't tell you, did she?

932
01:06:29,856 --> 01:06:32,191
I am Rebecca's favorite cousin.

933
01:06:33,985 --> 01:06:35,319
Toodle-oo!

934
01:08:33,272 --> 01:08:35,398
Do you wish anything, madam?

935
01:08:42,281 --> 01:08:44,491
I didn't expect to see you,
Mrs. Danvers.

936
01:08:44,659 --> 01:08:47,410
I noticed that a window wasn't closed
and I came up to see

937
01:08:47,578 --> 01:08:49,704
- if I could fasten it.
- Why did you say that?

938
01:08:49,872 --> 01:08:54,751
I closed it before I left the room.
You opened it yourself, didn't you?

939
01:08:56,128 --> 01:08:58,838
You've always wanted to see this room,
haven't you, madam?

940
01:08:59,006 --> 01:09:01,174
Why did you never ask me
to show it to you?

941
01:09:01,967 --> 01:09:04,260
I was ready to show it to you every day.

942
01:09:08,891 --> 01:09:11,143
It's a lovely room, isn't it?

943
01:09:11,311 --> 01:09:13,479
Loveliest room you've ever seen.

944
01:09:13,647 --> 01:09:16,107
Everything is kept
just as Mrs. De Winter liked it.

945
01:09:16,274 --> 01:09:18,609
Nothing has been altered
since that last night.

946
01:09:19,194 --> 01:09:21,904
Come. I'll show you her dressing room.

947
01:09:25,325 --> 01:09:27,952
This is where I keep all her clothes.

948
01:09:28,829 --> 01:09:31,664
You would like to see them,
wouldn't you?

949
01:09:42,884 --> 01:09:44,218
Feel this.

950
01:09:46,096 --> 01:09:49,306
It was a Christmas present
from Mr. De Winter.

951
01:09:51,810 --> 01:09:54,895
He was always giving her expensive
gifts, the whole year round.

952
01:09:57,399 --> 01:09:59,900
I keep her underwear on this side.

953
01:10:02,279 --> 01:10:06,073
They were made specially for her by
the nuns in the Convent of St. Claire.

954
01:10:09,995 --> 01:10:13,164
I always used to wait up for her,
no matter how late.

955
01:10:13,331 --> 01:10:17,209
Sometimes she and Mr. De Winter
didn't come home until dawn.

956
01:10:19,254 --> 01:10:22,548
While she was undressing, she'd tell me
about the party she'd been to.

957
01:10:22,716 --> 01:10:24,800
She knew everyone that mattered.

958
01:10:24,968 --> 01:10:26,719
Everyone loved her.

959
01:10:29,389 --> 01:10:31,515
When she finished her bath,

960
01:10:31,933 --> 01:10:34,977
she'd go into the bedroom
and go over to the dressing table.

961
01:10:45,655 --> 01:10:48,950
Oh, you've moved her brush, haven't you?
There. That's better.

962
01:10:49,118 --> 01:10:51,286
Just as she always laid it down.

963
01:10:51,454 --> 01:10:53,622
"Come on, Danny. Hair drill, "
she would say.

964
01:10:53,998 --> 01:10:58,251
And I'd stand behind her like this
and brush away for 20 minutes at a time.

965
01:10:59,295 --> 01:11:02,839
And then she would say,
"Good night, Danny, "

966
01:11:04,133 --> 01:11:06,009
and step into her bed.

967
01:11:13,768 --> 01:11:17,771
I embroidered this case for her myself,
and I keep it here always.

968
01:11:26,614 --> 01:11:29,324
Did you ever see anything so delicate?

969
01:11:42,672 --> 01:11:45,966
Look. You can see my hand through it.

970
01:12:07,947 --> 01:12:11,366
You wouldn't think she'd been gone
so long, would you?

971
01:12:12,076 --> 01:12:14,369
Sometimes when I walk along
the corridor,

972
01:12:14,579 --> 01:12:16,913
I fancy I hear her just behind me.

973
01:12:17,081 --> 01:12:20,584
That quick light step.
I couldn't mistake it anywhere.

974
01:12:21,669 --> 01:12:25,298
Not only in this room,
it's in all the rooms in the house.

975
01:12:26,717 --> 01:12:28,718
I can almost hear it now.

976
01:12:30,888 --> 01:12:33,055
Do you think the dead come back
and watch the living?

977
01:12:33,223 --> 01:12:35,224
No, I don't believe it.

978
01:12:36,268 --> 01:12:40,855
Sometimes I wonder if she doesn't
come back here to Manderley,

979
01:12:41,815 --> 01:12:44,358
and watch you
and Mr. De Winter together.

980
01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:48,362
You look tired.

981
01:12:48,989 --> 01:12:51,908
Why don't you stay here
a while and rest?

982
01:12:52,117 --> 01:12:53,784
And listen to the sea.

983
01:12:56,163 --> 01:12:57,580
So soothing.

984
01:13:00,334 --> 01:13:01,792
Listen to it.

985
01:13:05,923 --> 01:13:07,089
Listen.

986
01:13:10,344 --> 01:13:12,011
Listen to the sea.

987
01:13:40,832 --> 01:13:43,626
Tell Mrs. Danvers
I wish to see her immediately.

988
01:14:10,655 --> 01:14:12,572
You sent for me, madam?

989
01:14:13,825 --> 01:14:15,492
Yes, Mrs. Danvers.

990
01:14:16,327 --> 01:14:18,203
I want you to get rid
of all these things.

991
01:14:18,371 --> 01:14:23,083
- These are Mrs. De Winter's things.
- I am Mrs. De Winter now.

992
01:14:24,961 --> 01:14:26,878
Very well. I'll give the instructions.

993
01:14:30,925 --> 01:14:32,801
Just a moment, please.

994
01:14:35,138 --> 01:14:38,682
Mrs. Danvers, I intend to say nothing
to Mr. De Winter

995
01:14:38,850 --> 01:14:40,767
about Mr. Favell's visit.

996
01:14:40,935 --> 01:14:44,521
In fact, I prefer to forget
everything that happened this afternoon.

997
01:14:53,573 --> 01:14:55,741
Maxim, Maxim, you've been gone all day.

998
01:14:55,908 --> 01:14:57,576
You're choking me.

999
01:14:58,036 --> 01:15:00,120
Well, well, well, what have
you been doing with yourself?

1000
01:15:00,288 --> 01:15:02,789
- I've been thinking.
- What did you want to do that for?

1001
01:15:02,957 --> 01:15:05,000
Come in here and I'll tell you.

1002
01:15:06,961 --> 01:15:11,339
Darling, could we have a costume ball
just as you used to?

1003
01:15:13,051 --> 01:15:15,552
Now what put that into your mind?

1004
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:16,887
Has Beatrice been at you?

1005
01:15:17,055 --> 01:15:19,389
No, no, but I feel
that we ought to do something

1006
01:15:19,557 --> 01:15:23,101
to make people feel that Manderley
is just the same as it always was.

1007
01:15:25,730 --> 01:15:28,065
Oh, please, darling, could we?

1008
01:15:30,693 --> 01:15:32,778
You don't know what it would mean,
you know.

1009
01:15:32,945 --> 01:15:36,282
You'd have to be hostess
to hundreds of people, all the county.

1010
01:15:37,076 --> 01:15:38,993
And a lot of young people
would come up from London,

1011
01:15:39,161 --> 01:15:42,121
- and turn the house into a nightclub.
- Oh, yes. But I want to. Please.

1012
01:15:42,289 --> 01:15:45,083
I've never been to a large party,
but I could learn what to do.

1013
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:48,169
And I promise you,
you wouldn't be ashamed of me.

1014
01:15:57,387 --> 01:15:59,013
All right, if you think you'd enjoy it.

1015
01:15:59,181 --> 01:16:00,932
You'd better get Mrs. Danvers
to help you out, won't you?

1016
01:16:01,100 --> 01:16:04,519
No, no. I don't need Mrs. Danvers
to help me. I can do it myself.

1017
01:16:05,437 --> 01:16:07,063
All right, my sweet.

1018
01:16:07,231 --> 01:16:09,357
Thank you, darling. Thank you.

1019
01:16:11,110 --> 01:16:12,610
- What'll you go as?
- I never dress up.

1020
01:16:12,778 --> 01:16:14,779
That's the one privilege I claim
as the host.

1021
01:16:14,947 --> 01:16:17,323
What will you be? Alice in Wonderland,
with that ribbon around your hair?

1022
01:16:17,491 --> 01:16:18,449
No, I won't tell you.

1023
01:16:18,617 --> 01:16:22,120
I'll design a costume all by myself
and give you the surprise of your life.

1024
01:16:39,596 --> 01:16:40,805
Come in.

1025
01:16:45,310 --> 01:16:47,478
Robert found these sketches
in the library, madam.

1026
01:16:47,646 --> 01:16:50,481
- Did you intend throwing them away?
- Yes, Mrs. Danvers, I did.

1027
01:16:50,649 --> 01:16:53,818
They were just some ideas I was
sketching for my costume for the ball.

1028
01:16:53,986 --> 01:16:55,987
Hasn't Mr. De Winter suggested anything?

1029
01:16:56,155 --> 01:16:59,198
No, I want to surprise him. I don't want
him to know anything about it.

1030
01:16:59,366 --> 01:17:01,993
I merely thought
that you might find a costume

1031
01:17:02,161 --> 01:17:04,328
among the family portraits
that would suit you.

1032
01:17:04,496 --> 01:17:07,707
Oh, you mean those at the top
of the stairs? I'll go and look at them.

1033
01:17:15,049 --> 01:17:18,468
This one, for instance.
Might have been designed for you.

1034
01:17:19,137 --> 01:17:21,555
I'm sure you could have it copied.

1035
01:17:21,764 --> 01:17:25,517
I've heard Mr. De Winter say that this
is his favorite of all the paintings.

1036
01:17:25,810 --> 01:17:28,270
It's Lady Caroline de Winter,
one of his ancestors.

1037
01:17:28,813 --> 01:17:32,858
Oh, well, that's a splendid idea,
Mrs. Danvers. I'm very grateful.

1038
01:18:00,678 --> 01:18:03,722
- Everything under control, Frith?
- Yes, sir, thank you.

1039
01:18:04,057 --> 01:18:06,892
Excuse me, sir, are you supposed to be
a schoolmaster?

1040
01:18:07,101 --> 01:18:09,561
Oh, no. This is just
my old cap and gown.

1041
01:18:09,729 --> 01:18:13,607
It certainly makes a very nice costume,
sir. And economical, too.

1042
01:18:14,901 --> 01:18:16,902
Yes. That was the idea.

1043
01:18:27,247 --> 01:18:29,915
Good evening, Robert.
Not very good weather for the ball.

1044
01:18:30,083 --> 01:18:33,293
- No, sir.
- Very misty on the way and very chilly.

1045
01:18:34,003 --> 01:18:36,922
Oh, this wig's so tight
they ought to send an aspirin with it.

1046
01:18:37,090 --> 01:18:39,967
Hello. What's the idea? Adam and Eve?

1047
01:18:40,134 --> 01:18:41,551
Oh, Maxim, don't be disgusting.

1048
01:18:41,719 --> 01:18:44,680
- Strongman. Where's my weight thing?
- What thing?

1049
01:18:44,847 --> 01:18:46,807
You haven't left it in the car,
have you?

1050
01:18:46,975 --> 01:18:48,434
There it is.

1051
01:18:48,894 --> 01:18:49,978
- You were the first one down?
- Yes.

1052
01:18:50,145 --> 01:18:51,104
Where's the child?

1053
01:18:51,272 --> 01:18:52,438
Well, she's keeping her costume
a terrific secret.

1054
01:18:52,606 --> 01:18:53,773
Wouldn't even let me into her room.

1055
01:18:53,941 --> 01:18:55,316
Oh, lovely.

1056
01:18:56,694 --> 01:18:58,569
I'll go up and give her a hand.

1057
01:18:59,029 --> 01:19:01,698
- I could do with a drink.
- Won't you catch a cold in that thing?

1058
01:19:01,865 --> 01:19:04,158
Don't be silly. Pure wool, old boy.

1059
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:09,372
- Pardon me, sir. You forgot this.
- Thank you.

1060
01:19:14,461 --> 01:19:17,463
Here I am, dear, it's Bea.
I've come to give you a hand.

1061
01:19:17,631 --> 01:19:19,132
Oh, please don't
come in, Beatrice.

1062
01:19:19,300 --> 01:19:20,967
I don't want anyone to see my costume.

1063
01:19:21,135 --> 01:19:23,469
Oh. Oh, you won't be long, will you?

1064
01:19:23,637 --> 01:19:26,764
Because the first people
will be arriving any moment.

1065
01:19:26,932 --> 01:19:28,182
Now, you're sure
that's where that should be?

1066
01:19:28,350 --> 01:19:29,559
Yes, madam, it's just right.

1067
01:19:29,727 --> 01:19:31,936
- Isn't it exciting?
- Indeed it is, madam.

1068
01:19:32,104 --> 01:19:35,231
I've always heard of the Manderley ball,
and now I'm really going to see one.

1069
01:19:35,399 --> 01:19:37,608
I'm sure there will be no one there
to touch you, madam.

1070
01:19:37,776 --> 01:19:40,028
Do you really think so?
Now, where's my fan?

1071
01:19:40,195 --> 01:19:41,195
Here.

1072
01:19:41,655 --> 01:19:45,325
- You're sure I look all right?
- You look ever so beautiful.

1073
01:19:48,078 --> 01:19:49,704
Well, here goes.

1074
01:20:51,142 --> 01:20:53,268
Good evening, Mr. De Winter.

1075
01:20:59,401 --> 01:21:01,443
What the devil do you think
you're doing?

1076
01:21:01,611 --> 01:21:02,861
Rebecca.

1077
01:21:03,905 --> 01:21:07,199
But it's the picture.
The one in the gallery.

1078
01:21:10,662 --> 01:21:13,414
- What is it? What have I done?
- Go and take it off.

1079
01:21:13,581 --> 01:21:16,166
It doesn't matter what you put on.
Anything will do.

1080
01:21:18,002 --> 01:21:20,671
What are you standing there for?
Didn't you hear what I said?

1081
01:21:21,923 --> 01:21:23,674
Sir George and Lady Moore.

1082
01:21:23,842 --> 01:21:26,760
Dudley Tennant.
Admiral and Lady Burbank.

1083
01:21:47,282 --> 01:21:50,784
I watched you go down,
just as I watched her a year ago.

1084
01:21:51,119 --> 01:21:53,454
Even in the same dress,
you couldn't compare.

1085
01:21:53,621 --> 01:21:54,621
You knew it.

1086
01:21:54,789 --> 01:21:58,333
You knew that she wore it, and yet
you deliberately suggested I wear it.

1087
01:21:58,501 --> 01:22:01,629
Why do you hate me? What have I done
to you that you should ever hate me so?

1088
01:22:01,797 --> 01:22:03,882
You tried to take her place,
you let him marry you.

1089
01:22:04,049 --> 01:22:05,675
I've seen his face, his eyes.

1090
01:22:06,302 --> 01:22:08,470
They're the same as those first weeks
after she died.

1091
01:22:08,637 --> 01:22:11,139
I used to listen to him walking
up and down, up and down,

1092
01:22:11,307 --> 01:22:13,016
all night long, night after night,

1093
01:22:13,184 --> 01:22:16,478
thinking of her, suffering torture
because he'd lost her.

1094
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:19,481
I don't want to know.
I don't want to know!

1095
01:22:20,191 --> 01:22:23,526
You thought you could be Mrs. De Winter,
live in her house, walk in her steps,

1096
01:22:23,694 --> 01:22:26,196
take the things that were hers.
But she's too strong for you.

1097
01:22:26,363 --> 01:22:29,908
You can't fight her. No one ever
got the better of her. Never. Never.

1098
01:22:30,451 --> 01:22:33,620
She was beaten in the end,
but it wasn't a man, it wasn't a woman.

1099
01:22:33,787 --> 01:22:34,829
It was the sea.

1100
01:22:34,997 --> 01:22:37,957
Oh, stop it. Stop it. Oh, stop it.

1101
01:22:57,895 --> 01:23:01,439
You're overwrought, madam.
I've opened a window for you.

1102
01:23:02,066 --> 01:23:04,192
A little air will do you good.

1103
01:23:18,082 --> 01:23:21,209
Why don't you go?
Why don't you leave Manderley?

1104
01:23:22,378 --> 01:23:26,172
He doesn't need you.
He's got his memories.

1105
01:23:27,383 --> 01:23:30,969
He doesn't love you.
He wants to be alone again with her.

1106
01:23:32,054 --> 01:23:34,180
You've nothing to stay for.

1107
01:23:35,057 --> 01:23:37,643
You've nothing to live for, really,
have you?

1108
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:41,522
Look down there. It's easy, isn't it?

1109
01:23:43,567 --> 01:23:47,570
Why don't you? Why don't you?

1110
01:23:49,155 --> 01:23:53,409
Go on.

1111
01:23:54,536 --> 01:23:56,120
Don't be afraid.

1112
01:24:07,090 --> 01:24:08,966
Shipwreck.
Ship on the rocks!

1113
01:24:09,134 --> 01:24:11,760
- A ship aground, sending up rockets!
- Shipwreck!

1114
01:24:11,928 --> 01:24:13,470
Come on, everybody,
down to the bay.

1115
01:24:13,638 --> 01:24:15,723
Notify the coast guard.
She's aground.

1116
01:24:15,890 --> 01:24:17,433
Maxim! Maxim!

1117
01:24:17,601 --> 01:24:19,893
Ship ashore.
Come on! Come on, everybody.

1118
01:24:20,061 --> 01:24:22,605
Come on! Come on!
- Maxim! Maxim!

1119
01:24:48,214 --> 01:24:49,214
Oh!

1120
01:24:52,761 --> 01:24:55,554
Ben, have you seen
Mr. De Winter anywhere?

1121
01:24:55,889 --> 01:24:59,350
She won't come back, will she?
You said so.

1122
01:25:00,435 --> 01:25:02,519
Who, Ben? What do you mean?

1123
01:25:03,188 --> 01:25:04,938
The other one.

1124
01:25:18,329 --> 01:25:21,831
- Frank, have you seen Maxim anywhere?
- Not since about half an hour ago.

1125
01:25:21,999 --> 01:25:23,416
I thought he'd gone up to the house.

1126
01:25:23,584 --> 01:25:24,751
No, he hasn't been in the house at all,

1127
01:25:24,919 --> 01:25:27,504
and I'm afraid something
might have happened to him.

1128
01:25:28,714 --> 01:25:31,341
Frank, what's the matter?
Is anything wrong?

1129
01:25:31,884 --> 01:25:34,260
- There is something wrong.
- Well...

1130
01:25:34,970 --> 01:25:37,764
The diver who went down to inspect
the bottom of the ship

1131
01:25:37,932 --> 01:25:41,518
came across the hull of another boat.
A little sailboat.

1132
01:25:42,853 --> 01:25:44,396
- Frank, is it...
- Yes.

1133
01:25:45,272 --> 01:25:46,815
It's Rebecca's.

1134
01:25:48,859 --> 01:25:50,694
How did they recognize it?

1135
01:25:50,861 --> 01:25:53,488
He's a local man. Knew it instantly.

1136
01:25:54,448 --> 01:25:56,783
It'll be so hard on poor Maxim.

1137
01:25:57,034 --> 01:26:01,413
Yes. It's going to bring it all
back again, and worse than before.

1138
01:26:04,166 --> 01:26:06,126
Why did they have to find it?

1139
01:26:06,293 --> 01:26:08,211
Why couldn't they have left it
there in peace

1140
01:26:08,379 --> 01:26:10,338
at the bottom of the sea?

1141
01:26:11,966 --> 01:26:16,052
Well, I'd better get along and arrange
some breakfast for the men.

1142
01:26:16,220 --> 01:26:19,305
All right, Frank.
I'll go and look for Maxim.

1143
01:26:55,218 --> 01:26:57,052
- Hello.
- Maxim.

1144
01:26:58,764 --> 01:27:00,890
You haven't had any sleep.

1145
01:27:02,309 --> 01:27:05,102
- Have you forgiven me?
- Forgiven you?

1146
01:27:05,729 --> 01:27:08,105
What have I got to forgive you for?

1147
01:27:08,273 --> 01:27:11,567
For last night.
My stupidity about the costume.

1148
01:27:12,110 --> 01:27:13,402
Oh, that.

1149
01:27:14,946 --> 01:27:18,032
I'd forgotten.
I was angry with you, wasn't I?

1150
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:19,283
Hmm.

1151
01:27:22,913 --> 01:27:25,498
Maxim, can't we start all over again?

1152
01:27:25,665 --> 01:27:29,460
I don't ask that you should love me.
I won't ask impossible things.

1153
01:27:29,961 --> 01:27:33,839
I'll be your friend, your companion.
I'll be happy with that.

1154
01:27:40,847 --> 01:27:43,098
You love me very much, don't you?

1155
01:27:47,938 --> 01:27:50,147
But it's too late, my darling.

1156
01:27:52,067 --> 01:27:54,318
We've lost our little chance
of happiness.

1157
01:27:54,486 --> 01:27:56,737
- No, Maxim, no.
- Yes.

1158
01:27:57,864 --> 01:27:59,532
It's all over now.

1159
01:28:00,492 --> 01:28:02,493
The thing's happened.

1160
01:28:03,161 --> 01:28:05,663
The thing I have dreaded day after day.

1161
01:28:06,998 --> 01:28:10,292
- Night after night.
- Maxim, what are you trying to tell me?

1162
01:28:12,504 --> 01:28:14,088
Rebecca has won.

1163
01:28:17,801 --> 01:28:22,096
Her shadow has been between us all
the time, keeping us from one another.

1164
01:28:24,057 --> 01:28:26,350
She knew that this would happen.

1165
01:28:27,061 --> 01:28:28,854
What are you saying?

1166
01:28:30,189 --> 01:28:32,190
They sent a diver down.

1167
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:35,318
- He found another boat.
- Yes, I know. Frank told me.

1168
01:28:35,778 --> 01:28:40,031
Rebecca's boat. Oh, it's
terrible for you. I'm so sorry.

1169
01:28:40,908 --> 01:28:43,410
The diver made another discovery.

1170
01:28:43,661 --> 01:28:46,162
Broke one of the ports
and looked into the cabin.

1171
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:49,541
There was a body in there.

1172
01:28:50,751 --> 01:28:53,753
She wasn't alone.
There was someone sailing with her,

1173
01:28:53,921 --> 01:28:57,048
and you have to find out who it was,
that's it, isn't it, Maxim?

1174
01:28:57,216 --> 01:29:01,219
You don't understand.
There was no one with her.

1175
01:29:02,805 --> 01:29:06,057
It's Rebecca's body lying there
on the cabin floor.

1176
01:29:07,393 --> 01:29:08,560
Oh, no.

1177
01:29:09,729 --> 01:29:11,980
The woman that was washed up
at Edgecombe,

1178
01:29:12,815 --> 01:29:15,275
the woman that is now buried
in the family crypt,

1179
01:29:16,402 --> 01:29:18,236
that was not Rebecca.

1180
01:29:19,071 --> 01:29:21,740
That was the body
of some unknown woman,

1181
01:29:21,908 --> 01:29:24,367
unclaimed, belonging nowhere.

1182
01:29:26,329 --> 01:29:29,539
I identified it.
But I knew it wasn't Rebecca.

1183
01:29:30,917 --> 01:29:32,542
It was all a lie.

1184
01:29:34,420 --> 01:29:36,880
I knew where Rebecca's body was,

1185
01:29:38,257 --> 01:29:41,134
lying on that cabin floor
on the bottom of the sea.

1186
01:29:41,594 --> 01:29:43,595
How did you know, Maxim?

1187
01:29:44,221 --> 01:29:47,432
Because I put it there.

1188
01:29:55,942 --> 01:29:59,694
Will you look into my eyes
and tell me that you love me now?

1189
01:30:12,250 --> 01:30:15,002
You see? I was right.

1190
01:30:17,381 --> 01:30:18,839
It's too late.

1191
01:30:25,305 --> 01:30:28,432
No, it's not too late.
You're not to say that.

1192
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:30,810
I love you more than anything
in the world.

1193
01:30:31,061 --> 01:30:33,980
- Oh, please, Maxim, kiss me, please.
- No.

1194
01:30:34,856 --> 01:30:37,483
It's no use. It's too late.

1195
01:30:37,651 --> 01:30:41,195
Oh, we can't lose each other now.
We must be together always.

1196
01:30:41,363 --> 01:30:42,697
No secrets, no shadows.

1197
01:30:42,864 --> 01:30:45,825
We may only have a few days,
a few hours.

1198
01:30:45,993 --> 01:30:47,910
Maxim, why didn't you tell me before?

1199
01:30:48,078 --> 01:30:50,913
I nearly did sometimes,
but you never seemed close enough.

1200
01:30:51,081 --> 01:30:54,458
How could we be close when I knew
you were always thinking of Rebecca?

1201
01:30:55,335 --> 01:30:59,296
How could I even ask you to love me,
when I knew you loved Rebecca still?

1202
01:31:00,632 --> 01:31:02,758
What are you talking about?

1203
01:31:03,802 --> 01:31:05,428
What do you mean?

1204
01:31:06,638 --> 01:31:10,099
Whenever you touched me, I knew
you were comparing me with Rebecca.

1205
01:31:11,560 --> 01:31:15,938
Whenever you looked at me or spoke
to me or walked with me in the garden,

1206
01:31:16,356 --> 01:31:20,693
I knew you were thinking, "This I did
with Rebecca, and this, and this. "

1207
01:31:21,278 --> 01:31:22,653
Oh, it's true, isn't it?

1208
01:31:22,863 --> 01:31:26,240
You thought I loved Rebecca?
You thought that?

1209
01:31:29,703 --> 01:31:31,245
I hated her.

1210
01:31:43,718 --> 01:31:48,180
Oh, I was carried away by her,
enchanted by her as everyone was.

1211
01:31:49,432 --> 01:31:53,560
And when I was married, I was told
I was the luckiest man in the world.

1212
01:31:56,689 --> 01:32:00,108
She was so lovely, so accomplished,

1213
01:32:00,860 --> 01:32:02,235
so amusing.

1214
01:32:03,196 --> 01:32:06,698
"She's got the three things that really
matter in a wife, " everyone said.

1215
01:32:06,908 --> 01:32:09,242
"Breeding, brains and beauty. "

1216
01:32:09,577 --> 01:32:12,162
And I believed them. Completely.

1217
01:32:13,915 --> 01:32:16,958
But I never had
a moment's happiness with her.

1218
01:32:17,210 --> 01:32:19,211
She was incapable of love

1219
01:32:19,587 --> 01:32:21,129
or tenderness

1220
01:32:22,006 --> 01:32:23,381
or decency.

1221
01:32:24,509 --> 01:32:27,010
You didn't love her.
You didn't love her.

1222
01:32:28,513 --> 01:32:31,890
Do you remember that cliff
where you first saw me in Monte Carlo?

1223
01:32:33,476 --> 01:32:36,061
Well, I went there with Rebecca
on our honeymoon.

1224
01:32:36,562 --> 01:32:40,273
That's where I found out about her,
four days after we were married.

1225
01:32:42,193 --> 01:32:46,113
She stood there laughing,
her black hair blowing in the wind

1226
01:32:47,490 --> 01:32:51,368
and told me all about herself.
Everything.

1227
01:32:54,122 --> 01:32:56,706
Things I'll never tell a living soul.

1228
01:32:57,750 --> 01:32:59,543
I wanted to kill her.

1229
01:32:59,836 --> 01:33:02,295
It would have been so easy.
You remember the precipice?

1230
01:33:04,674 --> 01:33:08,301
I frightened you, didn't I?
You thought I was mad.

1231
01:33:09,178 --> 01:33:12,264
Perhaps I was. Perhaps I am mad.

1232
01:33:13,641 --> 01:33:16,602
It wouldn't make for sanity, would it?
Living with the devil?

1233
01:33:20,149 --> 01:33:22,358
"I'll make a bargain with you, "
she said.

1234
01:33:22,526 --> 01:33:24,861
"You'd look rather foolish
trying to divorce me now

1235
01:33:25,028 --> 01:33:26,404
after four days of marriage,

1236
01:33:26,572 --> 01:33:28,197
so I'll play the part
of a devoted wife,

1237
01:33:28,365 --> 01:33:29,907
mistress of your precious Manderley.

1238
01:33:30,075 --> 01:33:33,119
I'll make it the most famous showplace
in England, if you like,

1239
01:33:33,287 --> 01:33:34,912
and people will visit us and envy us,

1240
01:33:35,080 --> 01:33:38,166
and say we're the luckiest,
happiest couple in the country.

1241
01:33:40,544 --> 01:33:43,337
What a grand joke it'll be.
What a triumph. "

1242
01:33:48,427 --> 01:33:52,305
I should never have accepted
her dirty bargain, but I did.

1243
01:33:54,016 --> 01:33:58,144
I was younger then, and tremendously
conscious of the family honor.

1244
01:33:59,980 --> 01:34:01,439
Family honor.

1245
01:34:02,566 --> 01:34:05,526
She knew that I'd sacrifice everything
rather than stand up in a divorce court

1246
01:34:05,694 --> 01:34:08,613
and give her away, admit that
our marriage was a rotten fraud.

1247
01:34:11,533 --> 01:34:13,367
You despise me, don't you?

1248
01:34:14,161 --> 01:34:15,203
As I despise myself.

1249
01:34:15,370 --> 01:34:18,247
You can't understand
what my feelings were,

1250
01:34:19,541 --> 01:34:20,541
can you?

1251
01:34:21,877 --> 01:34:24,295
Of course I can, darling.
Of course I can.

1252
01:34:27,382 --> 01:34:30,885
Well, I kept the bargain
and so did she, apparently.

1253
01:34:31,053 --> 01:34:33,471
Oh, she played the game brilliantly,

1254
01:34:33,722 --> 01:34:36,140
but after a while,
she began to grow careless.

1255
01:34:36,391 --> 01:34:39,560
She took a flat in London,
and she'd stay away for days at a time.

1256
01:34:39,895 --> 01:34:42,396
Then she started
to bring her friends down here.

1257
01:34:42,731 --> 01:34:44,440
I warned her,
but she shrugged her shoulders.

1258
01:34:44,608 --> 01:34:46,817
"What's it got to do with you?"
She said.

1259
01:34:47,402 --> 01:34:49,320
She even started on Frank.

1260
01:34:49,905 --> 01:34:51,530
Poor, faithful Frank.

1261
01:34:52,450 --> 01:34:56,245
Then there was a cousin of hers,
a man named Favell.

1262
01:34:56,704 --> 01:34:59,414
Yes. I know him.
He came the day you went to London.

1263
01:35:00,875 --> 01:35:02,417
Why didn't you tell me?

1264
01:35:02,585 --> 01:35:04,253
I didn't like to.

1265
01:35:04,837 --> 01:35:07,339
I thought it would
remind you of Rebecca.

1266
01:35:08,132 --> 01:35:09,466
Remind me?

1267
01:35:11,344 --> 01:35:13,345
As if I needed reminding.

1268
01:35:14,931 --> 01:35:17,599
Favell used to visit her here
in this cottage.

1269
01:35:17,934 --> 01:35:20,185
I found out about it, and I warned her
that if he came here again,

1270
01:35:20,353 --> 01:35:21,812
I'd shoot them both.

1271
01:35:23,815 --> 01:35:27,359
One night, when I found she had
come back quietly from London,

1272
01:35:27,610 --> 01:35:29,778
I thought that Favell was with her,

1273
01:35:29,988 --> 01:35:32,322
and I knew then
that I couldn't stand

1274
01:35:32,490 --> 01:35:35,701
this life of filth and deceit
any longer.

1275
01:35:35,910 --> 01:35:39,705
I decided to come down here
and have it out with both of them.

1276
01:35:42,333 --> 01:35:43,834
But she was alone.

1277
01:35:44,002 --> 01:35:47,087
She was expecting Favell,
but he hadn't come.

1278
01:35:47,755 --> 01:35:51,675
She was lying on the divan, a large
tray of cigarette stubs beside her.

1279
01:35:53,469 --> 01:35:55,345
She looked ill, queer.

1280
01:35:56,139 --> 01:35:59,558
Suddenly, she got up,
started to walk toward me.

1281
01:36:01,561 --> 01:36:04,313
"When I have a child, " she said,
"neither you nor anyone else

1282
01:36:04,480 --> 01:36:06,440
could ever prove it wasn't yours.

1283
01:36:07,191 --> 01:36:08,483
You would like to have an heir,
wouldn't you, Max,

1284
01:36:08,651 --> 01:36:10,360
for your precious Manderley?"

1285
01:36:11,070 --> 01:36:12,571
Then she started to laugh.

1286
01:36:13,156 --> 01:36:16,116
"How funny.
How supremely, wonderfully funny.

1287
01:36:16,617 --> 01:36:19,745
I'll be the perfect mother,
just as I've been the perfect wife.

1288
01:36:19,912 --> 01:36:21,663
No one will ever know.

1289
01:36:21,956 --> 01:36:24,082
It ought to give you
the thrill of your life, Max,

1290
01:36:24,250 --> 01:36:26,960
to watch my son grow bigger day by day

1291
01:36:27,128 --> 01:36:30,089
and to know that when you die,
Manderley will be his. "

1292
01:36:32,176 --> 01:36:34,427
She was face to face with me.

1293
01:36:34,845 --> 01:36:38,431
One hand in her pocket,
the other holding a cigarette.

1294
01:36:39,850 --> 01:36:41,434
She was smiling.

1295
01:36:42,478 --> 01:36:43,853
"Well, Max?

1296
01:36:44,313 --> 01:36:46,856
What are you going to do about it?

1297
01:36:47,816 --> 01:36:50,026
Aren't you going to kill me?"

1298
01:36:52,529 --> 01:36:55,031
I suppose I went mad for a moment.

1299
01:36:56,241 --> 01:36:58,159
I must have struck her.

1300
01:37:02,289 --> 01:37:04,248
She stood staring at me.

1301
01:37:05,876 --> 01:37:08,086
She looked almost triumphant.

1302
01:37:09,755 --> 01:37:13,257
Then she started toward me again.
Smiling.

1303
01:37:14,468 --> 01:37:16,886
Suddenly, she stumbled and fell.

1304
01:37:22,351 --> 01:37:23,601
When I looked down,

1305
01:37:23,769 --> 01:37:26,687
ages afterwards, it seemed,
she was lying on the floor.

1306
01:37:26,855 --> 01:37:31,234
She had struck her head
on a heavy piece of ship's tackle.

1307
01:37:33,737 --> 01:37:36,823
I remember wondering
why she was still smiling.

1308
01:37:38,409 --> 01:37:40,076
Then I realized she was dead.

1309
01:37:40,244 --> 01:37:43,246
But you didn't kill her.
It was an accident.

1310
01:37:43,831 --> 01:37:45,623
Who would believe me?

1311
01:37:46,333 --> 01:37:47,875
I lost my head.

1312
01:37:48,252 --> 01:37:51,254
I just knew I had to do something.
Anything.

1313
01:37:52,423 --> 01:37:54,757
I carried her out to the boat.

1314
01:37:55,426 --> 01:37:58,010
It was very dark. There was no moon.

1315
01:37:59,096 --> 01:38:00,513
I put her in the cabin.

1316
01:38:01,432 --> 01:38:03,724
When the boat seemed a safe distance
from the shore, I took a spike,

1317
01:38:03,892 --> 01:38:06,770
and drove it again and again
through the planking of the hull.

1318
01:38:06,938 --> 01:38:09,940
I had opened up the seacocks
and the water began to come in fast.

1319
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:12,776
I climbed over into the dinghy
and pulled away.

1320
01:38:14,028 --> 01:38:16,155
I saw the boat heel over

1321
01:38:17,574 --> 01:38:18,824
and sink.

1322
01:38:20,618 --> 01:38:22,786
I pulled back into the cove.

1323
01:38:24,456 --> 01:38:26,165
It started raining.

1324
01:38:26,583 --> 01:38:31,211
- Maxim, does anyone else know of this?
- No. No one except you and me.

1325
01:38:33,548 --> 01:38:35,299
We must explain it.

1326
01:38:35,675 --> 01:38:38,635
It's got to be the body of someone
you've never seen before.

1327
01:38:38,803 --> 01:38:42,806
No, they're bound to know her.
Her rings, bracelets she always wore.

1328
01:38:43,808 --> 01:38:47,978
They'll identify her body,
then they'll remember the other woman.

1329
01:38:49,314 --> 01:38:51,899
The other woman buried in the crypt.

1330
01:38:52,442 --> 01:38:54,234
If they find out it was Rebecca,

1331
01:38:54,402 --> 01:38:57,154
you must simply say you made a mistake
about the other body.

1332
01:38:57,447 --> 01:38:58,864
That the day you went to Edgecombe,
you were ill,

1333
01:38:59,032 --> 01:39:00,491
you didn't know what you were doing.

1334
01:39:00,658 --> 01:39:03,160
Rebecca's dead. That's what
we've got to remember. Rebecca's dead.

1335
01:39:03,328 --> 01:39:06,997
She can't speak. She can't bear witness.
She can't harm you anymore.

1336
01:39:07,165 --> 01:39:10,083
We're the only two people in the world
that know, Maxim, you and I.

1337
01:39:10,251 --> 01:39:13,337
I'd told you once that I'd done
a selfish thing in marrying you.

1338
01:39:14,297 --> 01:39:16,882
You can understand now what I meant.

1339
01:39:17,592 --> 01:39:19,676
I've loved you, my darling.

1340
01:39:20,261 --> 01:39:22,262
I shall always love you,

1341
01:39:22,805 --> 01:39:24,515
but I've known all along

1342
01:39:25,183 --> 01:39:27,184
that Rebecca would win in the end.

1343
01:39:27,352 --> 01:39:29,520
No, no. She hasn't won.

1344
01:39:29,854 --> 01:39:32,648
No matter what happens now,
she hasn't won.

1345
01:39:46,997 --> 01:39:48,373
Hello?

1346
01:39:50,793 --> 01:39:52,252
Hello, Frank.

1347
01:39:52,545 --> 01:39:53,962
Hello, Frank. Yes.

1348
01:39:54,213 --> 01:39:55,964
Who? Colonel Julyan?

1349
01:39:57,591 --> 01:40:01,177
Yes. Tell him I'll meet him there
as soon as I possibly can.

1350
01:40:01,512 --> 01:40:02,595
What?

1351
01:40:04,723 --> 01:40:05,723
Well...

1352
01:40:06,392 --> 01:40:10,019
Say we could talk about that
when we're sure about the matter.

1353
01:40:13,524 --> 01:40:15,233
What's happened?

1354
01:40:16,402 --> 01:40:18,236
Colonel Julyan called.

1355
01:40:18,696 --> 01:40:21,072
He's the chief constable of the county.

1356
01:40:21,240 --> 01:40:23,950
He's been asked by the police
to go to the mortuary.

1357
01:40:24,618 --> 01:40:27,704
He wanted to know if I could possibly
have made a mistake

1358
01:40:28,747 --> 01:40:30,248
about that other body.

1359
01:40:50,769 --> 01:40:54,814
Well, Colonel Julyan, apparently I did
make a mistake about that other body.

1360
01:40:54,982 --> 01:40:57,025
The mistake was natural
under the circumstances.

1361
01:40:57,192 --> 01:41:00,945
- Besides, you weren't well at the time.
- That's nonsense. I was perfectly well.

1362
01:41:01,280 --> 01:41:05,158
Don't let it worry you, Maxim. Nobody
can blame you for making a mistake.

1363
01:41:06,285 --> 01:41:09,370
The pity is, you've got to go through
the same thing all over again.

1364
01:41:09,538 --> 01:41:10,788
What do you mean?

1365
01:41:10,956 --> 01:41:14,709
There'll have to be another inquest,
of course. Same formality and red tape.

1366
01:41:15,628 --> 01:41:19,048
Wish you could be spared the publicity
of it, but I'm afraid that's impossible.

1367
01:41:19,215 --> 01:41:21,383
Oh, yes, publicity.

1368
01:41:21,801 --> 01:41:26,055
I suppose Mrs. De Winter went below
for something and a squall hit the boat

1369
01:41:26,431 --> 01:41:28,140
with nobody at the helm.

1370
01:41:28,308 --> 01:41:30,684
I imagine that's about the solution now,
don't you think so, Crawley?

1371
01:41:30,852 --> 01:41:33,479
Oh, yes. Probably the door jammed,
and she couldn't get on deck again.

1372
01:41:33,647 --> 01:41:34,605
Yeah.

1373
01:41:34,773 --> 01:41:38,651
Tabb, the boat builder, will undoubtedly
come to some such conclusion.

1374
01:41:38,818 --> 01:41:41,028
Why, what would he know about it?

1375
01:41:41,529 --> 01:41:45,407
Well, he's examining the boat now.
Purely as a matter of routine, you know.

1376
01:41:45,950 --> 01:41:49,411
I'll be at the inquest tomorrow, Maxim,
quite unofficially, you know.

1377
01:41:49,704 --> 01:41:52,539
We must get together for a game
of golf when it's all over, eh?

1378
01:41:52,707 --> 01:41:53,707
Bye-bye.

1379
01:42:07,472 --> 01:42:09,890
I have the evening papers, madam.
Would you care to see them?

1380
01:42:10,058 --> 01:42:11,058
Oh, no thank you, Frith,

1381
01:42:11,226 --> 01:42:13,769
and I prefer that Mr. De Winter
weren't troubled with them, either.

1382
01:42:13,937 --> 01:42:17,523
I understand, madam. Permit me to say
that we're all most distressed outside.

1383
01:42:17,691 --> 01:42:18,857
Thank you, Frith.

1384
01:42:19,025 --> 01:42:22,027
I'm afraid the news has been
a great shock to Mrs. Danvers.

1385
01:42:22,195 --> 01:42:24,071
Yes, I rather expected it would be.

1386
01:42:24,239 --> 01:42:27,157
It seems there's to be
a coroner's inquest, madam?

1387
01:42:27,325 --> 01:42:29,785
Yes, Frith. It's purely a formality.

1388
01:42:29,953 --> 01:42:31,578
Of course, madam. I...

1389
01:42:31,746 --> 01:42:35,124
I wanted to say that if any of us
might be required to give evidence,

1390
01:42:35,291 --> 01:42:38,460
I should be only too pleased to do
anything that might help the family.

1391
01:42:38,628 --> 01:42:40,212
Oh, thank you, Frith, why, I...

1392
01:42:40,380 --> 01:42:42,965
I'm sure Mr. De Winter
will be very happy to hear it.

1393
01:42:43,383 --> 01:42:45,884
But I don't think
anything will be necessary.

1394
01:42:58,941 --> 01:43:00,108
Maxim.

1395
01:43:02,319 --> 01:43:03,862
Hello, darling.

1396
01:43:05,156 --> 01:43:08,241
Oh, Maxim, I'm worried about
what you'll do at the inquest tomorrow.

1397
01:43:08,659 --> 01:43:10,285
What do you mean?

1398
01:43:11,036 --> 01:43:12,620
You won't lose your temper, will you?

1399
01:43:12,788 --> 01:43:15,498
Promise me
that they won't make you angry.

1400
01:43:15,666 --> 01:43:18,418
All right, darling. I promise.

1401
01:43:18,586 --> 01:43:22,046
No matter what he asks you,
you won't lose your head?

1402
01:43:22,298 --> 01:43:23,965
Don't worry, dear.

1403
01:43:24,633 --> 01:43:26,760
They can't do anything at once,
can they?

1404
01:43:26,927 --> 01:43:28,636
No.

1405
01:43:29,305 --> 01:43:31,055
Then we've a little time left
to be together.

1406
01:43:31,223 --> 01:43:32,390
Yes.

1407
01:43:33,851 --> 01:43:37,937
- I want to go to the inquest with you.
- I'd rather you didn't, darling.

1408
01:43:38,272 --> 01:43:40,398
But I can't wait here alone.

1409
01:43:40,566 --> 01:43:43,359
I promise you,
I won't be any trouble to you.

1410
01:43:44,445 --> 01:43:46,613
And I must be near you
so that no matter what happens,

1411
01:43:46,781 --> 01:43:49,657
we won't be separated for a moment.

1412
01:43:50,785 --> 01:43:52,410
All right, dear.

1413
01:43:54,288 --> 01:43:57,373
I don't mind this whole thing
except for you.

1414
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,627
I can't forget what it's done to you.

1415
01:44:01,128 --> 01:44:04,547
I've been thinking of nothing else
since it happened.

1416
01:44:08,093 --> 01:44:09,803
It's gone forever,

1417
01:44:10,638 --> 01:44:14,557
that funny, young, lost look I loved.

1418
01:44:15,768 --> 01:44:17,769
It won't ever come back.

1419
01:44:18,646 --> 01:44:21,731
I killed that
when I told you about Rebecca.

1420
01:44:22,525 --> 01:44:23,858
It's gone.

1421
01:44:24,860 --> 01:44:29,239
In a few hours,
you've grown so much older.

1422
01:44:31,701 --> 01:44:33,661
Oh, Maxim, Maxim.

1423
01:45:00,021 --> 01:45:01,939
Black Jack Brady was his name.

1424
01:45:02,107 --> 01:45:04,733
The most important arrest I ever made.

1425
01:45:04,901 --> 01:45:06,902
It must have been
about two years ago now.

1426
01:45:07,070 --> 01:45:10,322
Of course, there was no doubt about it.
He was hung a month after I caught him.

1427
01:45:10,740 --> 01:45:12,366
Hello. Wait a minute.

1428
01:45:13,743 --> 01:45:16,203
They've got old Balmy Ben up now.

1429
01:45:17,038 --> 01:45:18,873
You remember
the late Mrs. De Winter, don't you?

1430
01:45:19,040 --> 01:45:21,125
- She's gone.
- Yes, we know that.

1431
01:45:21,668 --> 01:45:25,504
- She went in the sea. The sea got her.
- That's right. That's right.

1432
01:45:25,672 --> 01:45:28,173
Now we want you to tell us
whether you were on the shore

1433
01:45:28,341 --> 01:45:30,426
- that last night she went sailing.
- Eh?

1434
01:45:30,886 --> 01:45:35,222
Were you on the shore that last night
she went out, when she didn't come back?

1435
01:45:35,807 --> 01:45:40,227
I didn't see nothing.
I don't want to go to the asylum.

1436
01:45:40,395 --> 01:45:42,229
Them cruel folks there.

1437
01:45:42,397 --> 01:45:44,315
Now, nobody's going to send you
to the asylum.

1438
01:45:44,482 --> 01:45:47,401
All we want you to do
is tell us what you saw.

1439
01:45:47,569 --> 01:45:49,236
I didn't see nothing.

1440
01:45:49,446 --> 01:45:50,529
Come, come.

1441
01:45:50,697 --> 01:45:54,491
Did you see Mrs. De Winter
get into her boat that last night?

1442
01:45:54,826 --> 01:45:56,619
I don't know nothing.

1443
01:45:57,037 --> 01:45:59,455
I don't want to go to the asylum.

1444
01:46:02,584 --> 01:46:04,084
Very well. You may go.

1445
01:46:04,252 --> 01:46:05,794
- Eh?
- You may go now.

1446
01:46:08,132 --> 01:46:10,550
- Mr. Tabb, step forward, please.
- Yes?

1447
01:46:15,431 --> 01:46:17,474
The evidence you give
will be the truth, the whole truth

1448
01:46:17,642 --> 01:46:19,184
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

1449
01:46:19,352 --> 01:46:22,103
I do, so help me God.

1450
01:46:22,271 --> 01:46:24,022
The late Mrs. De Winter
used to send her boat

1451
01:46:24,190 --> 01:46:26,942
- to your shipyard for reconditioning.
- That's right, sir.

1452
01:46:27,109 --> 01:46:28,401
Can you remember any occasion

1453
01:46:28,569 --> 01:46:30,445
when she had any sort of accident
with the boat?

1454
01:46:30,613 --> 01:46:33,531
No, sir. I often said
Mrs. De Winter was a born sailor.

1455
01:46:33,699 --> 01:46:36,159
Now, when Mrs. De Winter
went below, as is supposed,

1456
01:46:36,327 --> 01:46:38,328
and a sudden gust of wind came down,

1457
01:46:38,496 --> 01:46:40,830
that would be enough to capsize
the boat, wouldn't it?

1458
01:46:40,998 --> 01:46:44,626
Excuse me, sir. But there's
a little more to it than that.

1459
01:46:45,002 --> 01:46:48,088
- What do you mean, Mr. Tabb?
- I mean, sir, the seacocks.

1460
01:46:48,255 --> 01:46:49,547
What are the seacocks?

1461
01:46:49,715 --> 01:46:50,715
Sea...

1462
01:46:52,176 --> 01:46:55,387
The seacocks are the valves
to drain out the boat.

1463
01:46:55,972 --> 01:46:59,307
They're always kept tight closed
when you're afloat.

1464
01:46:59,725 --> 01:47:00,809
Yes?

1465
01:47:01,310 --> 01:47:04,896
Well, yesterday, when I examined
that boat, I found they'd been opened.

1466
01:47:05,106 --> 01:47:06,773
What could be the reason for that?

1467
01:47:06,941 --> 01:47:10,318
Just this, that's what flooded the boat
and sunk her.

1468
01:47:11,737 --> 01:47:15,448
Are you implying
that boat never capsized at all?

1469
01:47:15,825 --> 01:47:19,411
I know it's a terrible thing to say,
sir, but in my opinion,

1470
01:47:19,578 --> 01:47:20,578
she was scuttled.

1471
01:47:24,208 --> 01:47:27,168
- And there's them holes.
- What holes?

1472
01:47:27,753 --> 01:47:30,380
- In her planking.
- What are you talking about?

1473
01:47:30,840 --> 01:47:34,092
Of course, that boat's been underwater
for over a year,

1474
01:47:34,260 --> 01:47:37,178
and the tide's been knocking her
against the ridge.

1475
01:47:37,346 --> 01:47:41,933
But it seemed to me them holes looked
as if she'd made them from the inside.

1476
01:47:43,352 --> 01:47:45,604
Then you believe
she must have done it deliberately.

1477
01:47:45,772 --> 01:47:49,734
Couldn't have been no accident,
not with her knowledge of boats.

1478
01:47:52,320 --> 01:47:54,155
You knew the former Mrs. De Winter
very well, I believe?

1479
01:47:54,322 --> 01:47:55,239
Oh, yes.

1480
01:47:55,407 --> 01:47:57,533
Would you have believed her
capable of suicide?

1481
01:47:58,243 --> 01:48:01,704
No. Frankly, I would not.
But you never can tell.

1482
01:48:02,873 --> 01:48:05,082
You may stand down, Mr. Tabb.

1483
01:48:06,084 --> 01:48:07,960
Mr. De Winter, please.

1484
01:48:17,054 --> 01:48:19,263
Sorry to drag you back
for further questioning, Mr. De Winter.

1485
01:48:19,431 --> 01:48:20,765
But you've heard
the statement of Mr. Tabb.

1486
01:48:20,932 --> 01:48:22,641
I wonder if you can help us in any way.

1487
01:48:22,809 --> 01:48:23,768
I'm afraid not.

1488
01:48:23,935 --> 01:48:25,561
Can you think of any reason
why there should be holes

1489
01:48:25,729 --> 01:48:27,897
in the planking
of the late Mrs. De Winter's boat?

1490
01:48:28,065 --> 01:48:30,483
Well, of course
I can't think of any reason.

1491
01:48:30,734 --> 01:48:32,860
Has anyone ever discussed
these holes with you before?

1492
01:48:33,028 --> 01:48:34,862
Well, since the boat has been
at the bottom of the ocean,

1493
01:48:35,030 --> 01:48:36,614
I scarcely think that likely.

1494
01:48:37,908 --> 01:48:39,909
Mr. De Winter, I want you
to believe we all feel very deeply

1495
01:48:40,077 --> 01:48:41,077
for you in this matter.

1496
01:48:41,244 --> 01:48:42,953
But you must remember
that I don't conduct this inquiry

1497
01:48:43,121 --> 01:48:44,080
for my own amusement.

1498
01:48:44,247 --> 01:48:46,123
- That's rather obvious, isn't it?
- I hope that it is.

1499
01:48:46,291 --> 01:48:47,833
Well, since she went sailing alone,

1500
01:48:48,001 --> 01:48:49,919
are we to believe
that she drove those holes herself?

1501
01:48:50,087 --> 01:48:51,629
You may believe what you like.

1502
01:48:51,797 --> 01:48:54,632
Can you enlighten us as to
why Mrs. De Winter should have wanted

1503
01:48:54,800 --> 01:48:56,175
to end her own life?

1504
01:48:56,343 --> 01:48:57,802
I know of no reason whatever.

1505
01:48:57,969 --> 01:49:00,721
Mr. De Winter,
however painful it may be,

1506
01:49:00,889 --> 01:49:02,598
I have to ask you
a very personal question.

1507
01:49:03,058 --> 01:49:12,024
Were relations between you and the late
Mrs. De Winter perfectly happy?

1508
01:49:12,192 --> 01:49:15,694
I won't stand this any longer!
You might as well know now...

1509
01:49:17,030 --> 01:49:18,405
We'll adjourn till after lunch.

1510
01:49:18,573 --> 01:49:22,202
Mr. De Winter, I presume
you'll be available for us then?

1511
01:49:23,287 --> 01:49:25,288
I told you,
you should have had some breakfast.

1512
01:49:25,456 --> 01:49:27,874
You're hungry.
That's what's the matter with you.

1513
01:49:32,964 --> 01:49:35,006
Mr. Frith thought you might
like to have some lunch from the house,

1514
01:49:35,174 --> 01:49:36,174
and sent me with it.

1515
01:49:36,342 --> 01:49:37,968
No, that's fine.
Pull around the corner.

1516
01:49:38,136 --> 01:49:39,803
Very good, sir.

1517
01:49:49,313 --> 01:49:51,064
Awfully foolish of me,
fainting like that.

1518
01:49:51,232 --> 01:49:53,984
Nonsense. If you hadn't fainted like
that, I'd have really lost my temper.

1519
01:49:54,152 --> 01:49:55,902
Darling, please be careful.

1520
01:50:03,244 --> 01:50:05,871
Darling, wait here a few moments.
I'll see if I can find old Frank.

1521
01:50:06,038 --> 01:50:07,789
Of course, darling.
Don't worry about me. I'll be all right.

1522
01:50:07,957 --> 01:50:08,957
Sure?

1523
01:50:11,377 --> 01:50:14,713
Here, try a spot of this. Do you good.

1524
01:50:14,881 --> 01:50:16,214
Thank you.

1525
01:50:19,177 --> 01:50:21,678
- Are you all right?
- Yes, of course.

1526
01:50:22,430 --> 01:50:24,764
- I won't be long.
- Right you are.

1527
01:50:28,060 --> 01:50:29,227
Hello.

1528
01:50:30,021 --> 01:50:32,856
And how does the bride
find herself today?

1529
01:50:35,568 --> 01:50:38,653
I say, marriage with Max
is not exactly a bed of roses, is it?

1530
01:50:38,821 --> 01:50:40,697
I think you'd better go
before Maxim gets back.

1531
01:50:40,865 --> 01:50:44,367
Oh, jealous, is he?
Well, I can't say I blame him.

1532
01:50:44,535 --> 01:50:47,245
But you don't think I'm
the big bad wolf, do you?

1533
01:50:47,413 --> 01:50:50,290
I'm not, you know. I'm a perfectly
ordinary, harmless bloke.

1534
01:50:50,583 --> 01:50:54,711
And I think you're behaving splendidly
over all this. Perfectly splendidly.

1535
01:50:55,796 --> 01:50:59,050
You know, you've grown up a bit
since I last saw you. It's no wonder...

1536
01:50:59,218 --> 01:51:00,801
What do you want, Favell?

1537
01:51:00,969 --> 01:51:04,305
Oh, hello, Max. Things are going
pretty well for you, aren't they?

1538
01:51:04,473 --> 01:51:06,057
Better than you ever expected.

1539
01:51:06,225 --> 01:51:09,060
I was rather worried about you at first.
That's why I came down to the inquest.

1540
01:51:09,228 --> 01:51:10,603
Well, I'm touched by your solicitude.

1541
01:51:10,771 --> 01:51:13,397
But if you don't mind,
we'd rather like to have our lunch.

1542
01:51:13,565 --> 01:51:17,568
Lunch? I say, what a jolly idea.
Rather like a picnic, isn't it?

1543
01:51:18,528 --> 01:51:21,405
I'm so sorry.
Do you mind if I put this there?

1544
01:51:21,573 --> 01:51:25,451
You know, Max, old boy, I really think
I ought to talk things over with you.

1545
01:51:25,619 --> 01:51:27,495
Talk what things over?

1546
01:51:27,955 --> 01:51:31,082
Well, those holes in the planking,
for one thing.

1547
01:51:31,291 --> 01:51:33,668
Those holes
that were drilled from the inside.

1548
01:51:33,835 --> 01:51:35,503
- Oh, Mullen?
- Yes, sir?

1549
01:51:36,338 --> 01:51:38,839
Would you, like a good fellow,
have my car filled with petrol?

1550
01:51:39,007 --> 01:51:40,299
- It's almost empty.
- Very good, sir.

1551
01:51:40,467 --> 01:51:42,927
- And, Mullen, close the door, will you?
- Yes, sir.

1552
01:51:44,388 --> 01:51:45,972
Does this bother you?

1553
01:51:53,730 --> 01:51:56,440
You know, old boy, I have a strong
feeling that before the day's out,

1554
01:51:56,608 --> 01:51:59,986
somebody's going to make use
of that rather expressive,

1555
01:52:00,153 --> 01:52:03,281
though somewhat old-fashioned term,
"foul play. "

1556
01:52:04,950 --> 01:52:07,159
Am I boring you with all this?

1557
01:52:08,078 --> 01:52:09,120
No?

1558
01:52:10,831 --> 01:52:14,792
Good. Well, you see, Max, I find
myself in a rather awkward position.

1559
01:52:15,127 --> 01:52:18,796
You've only got to read this note
to understand. It's from Rebecca.

1560
01:52:18,964 --> 01:52:21,924
And, what's more, she had the foresight
to put a date on it.

1561
01:52:23,427 --> 01:52:25,052
She wrote me the day she died.

1562
01:52:25,220 --> 01:52:27,555
Incidentally, I was at a party
on that night

1563
01:52:27,723 --> 01:52:29,307
so I didn't get it until the next day.

1564
01:52:29,474 --> 01:52:31,559
And what makes you think
that note would interest me?

1565
01:52:31,727 --> 01:52:33,395
Oh, I'm not gonna bother you
with the contents now.

1566
01:52:33,563 --> 01:52:35,731
But I can assure you
that it is not the note of a woman

1567
01:52:35,898 --> 01:52:38,817
who intends to drown herself
that same night.

1568
01:52:42,155 --> 01:52:45,991
By the way, what do you do
with old bones? Bury them?

1569
01:52:47,452 --> 01:52:49,745
However, for the time being...

1570
01:52:51,956 --> 01:52:54,791
You know, Max, I'm getting fed up
with my job as a motorcar salesman.

1571
01:52:54,959 --> 01:52:56,710
I don't know if you've
ever experienced the feeling

1572
01:52:56,878 --> 01:52:59,504
of driving an expensive motorcar
which isn't your own?

1573
01:52:59,839 --> 01:53:02,299
But it can be very, very exasperating.

1574
01:53:02,467 --> 01:53:05,135
You know what I mean.
You want to own the car yourself.

1575
01:53:05,303 --> 01:53:08,305
I often wonder what it would be like
to retire to the country.

1576
01:53:08,473 --> 01:53:11,683
Have a nice little place
with a few acres of shooting.

1577
01:53:11,851 --> 01:53:13,477
I've never figured out
what it would cost a year,

1578
01:53:13,644 --> 01:53:15,562
but I'd like to talk about it with you.

1579
01:53:15,730 --> 01:53:19,733
I'd like to have your advice on how
to live comfortably without hard work.

1580
01:53:21,319 --> 01:53:23,945
Hello, Favell.
You looking for me, Maxim?

1581
01:53:24,238 --> 01:53:25,322
Yes.

1582
01:53:26,282 --> 01:53:29,117
Mr. Favell and I have a little
business transaction on hand.

1583
01:53:29,285 --> 01:53:31,828
I think we had better conduct it
over at the inn.

1584
01:53:32,538 --> 01:53:35,082
They may have a private room there.

1585
01:53:36,209 --> 01:53:37,959
Well, see you later.

1586
01:53:39,212 --> 01:53:42,255
Find Colonel Julyan.
Tell him I want to see him immediately.

1587
01:53:42,590 --> 01:53:44,049
Come on, Favell. Let's go.

1588
01:53:49,472 --> 01:53:53,725
- Have you a private room, please?
- Of course, sir. Through there, sir.

1589
01:53:57,438 --> 01:53:59,231
Hope this will do, Mr. De Winter.

1590
01:53:59,399 --> 01:54:01,650
Splendid. Splendid.
Exactly like the Ritz.

1591
01:54:02,068 --> 01:54:03,151
Any orders, gents?

1592
01:54:03,319 --> 01:54:05,320
Yes. You might bring me
a large brandy and soda.

1593
01:54:05,488 --> 01:54:09,074
How about you, Max? Have one on me.
I feel I can afford to play host.

1594
01:54:09,242 --> 01:54:10,410
Thanks. I don't mind if I do.

1595
01:54:10,577 --> 01:54:11,869
Make it two, will you,
like a good fellow?

1596
01:54:12,037 --> 01:54:13,871
- Very good, sir.
Where's Mr. De Winter?

1597
01:54:14,039 --> 01:54:16,332
Through the other door, sir.

1598
01:54:16,500 --> 01:54:18,835
Colonel Julyan, this is Mr. Favell.

1599
01:54:19,962 --> 01:54:22,255
Oh, I know Colonel Julyan.
We're old friends, aren't we?

1600
01:54:22,423 --> 01:54:24,340
Since you're old friends,
I assume you also know

1601
01:54:24,508 --> 01:54:25,800
he's head of the police here.

1602
01:54:25,968 --> 01:54:28,761
He might be interested to hear your
proposition. Tell him all about it.

1603
01:54:28,929 --> 01:54:31,305
I don't know what you mean. I merely
said I hoped to give up selling cars

1604
01:54:31,473 --> 01:54:32,598
and retire into the country.

1605
01:54:32,766 --> 01:54:35,268
Actually, he offered to withhold a vital
piece of evidence from the inquest

1606
01:54:35,436 --> 01:54:37,061
if I made it worth his while.

1607
01:54:37,229 --> 01:54:39,313
I only want to see justice done,
Colonel.

1608
01:54:39,481 --> 01:54:42,233
Now, that boat builder's evidence
suggested certain possible theories

1609
01:54:42,401 --> 01:54:45,236
concerning Rebecca's death.
One of them, of course, is suicide.

1610
01:54:45,404 --> 01:54:47,405
Now I have a little note here
which I consider

1611
01:54:47,573 --> 01:54:50,074
puts that possibility
quite out of court.

1612
01:54:50,409 --> 01:54:52,034
Read it, Colonel.

1613
01:54:52,327 --> 01:54:53,661
"Jack, darling,

1614
01:54:53,829 --> 01:54:56,956
I've just seen the doctor and I'm going
down to Manderley right away.

1615
01:54:57,124 --> 01:54:58,583
I shall be at the cottage
all this evening

1616
01:54:58,750 --> 01:55:00,751
and shall leave
the door open for you.

1617
01:55:00,919 --> 01:55:03,379
I have something terribly
important to tell you.

1618
01:55:03,547 --> 01:55:04,464
Rebecca. "

1619
01:55:04,631 --> 01:55:06,007
Now, does that look
like the note of a woman

1620
01:55:06,175 --> 01:55:08,092
who had made up her mind
to kill herself?

1621
01:55:08,260 --> 01:55:09,635
And apart from that,
do you mean to tell me

1622
01:55:09,803 --> 01:55:11,971
that if you wanted to commit suicide,
you would go to all the trouble

1623
01:55:12,139 --> 01:55:14,640
of putting out to sea in a boat,
and then take a hammer and chisel

1624
01:55:14,808 --> 01:55:17,518
and laboriously knock holes
through the bottom of it?

1625
01:55:17,686 --> 01:55:20,062
Come, Colonel. As an officer of the law,

1626
01:55:20,230 --> 01:55:23,524
don't you feel there are some
slight grounds for suspicion?

1627
01:55:23,692 --> 01:55:25,568
- Of murder?
- What else?

1628
01:55:25,903 --> 01:55:29,155
You've known Max a long time. So
you know he's the old-fashioned type,

1629
01:55:29,323 --> 01:55:32,533
who'd die to defend his honor,
or who'd kill for it.

1630
01:55:32,743 --> 01:55:34,911
It's blackmail, pure and simple.

1631
01:55:35,078 --> 01:55:37,371
Blackmail is not so pure, nor so simple.

1632
01:55:37,539 --> 01:55:39,874
It can bring a lot of trouble
to a great many people.

1633
01:55:40,042 --> 01:55:43,211
And the blackmailer sometimes
finds himself in jail at the end of it.

1634
01:55:43,378 --> 01:55:46,173
Oh, I see. You're going to hold
de Winter's hand through all this.

1635
01:55:46,341 --> 01:55:48,258
Just because
he's the big noise around here

1636
01:55:48,426 --> 01:55:50,177
and he's actually permitted you
to dine with him.

1637
01:55:50,345 --> 01:55:53,138
Be careful, Favell.
You've brought an accusation of murder.

1638
01:55:53,306 --> 01:55:55,682
- Have you any witnesses?
- I do have a witness.

1639
01:55:55,850 --> 01:55:57,184
It's that fellow, Ben.

1640
01:55:57,352 --> 01:55:59,520
If that stupid coroner hadn't been
as much of a snob as you are,

1641
01:55:59,687 --> 01:56:01,688
he'd have seen
that half-wit was hiding something.

1642
01:56:01,856 --> 01:56:02,856
And why should Ben do that?

1643
01:56:03,024 --> 01:56:04,441
Because we caught him once,
Rebecca and I,

1644
01:56:04,609 --> 01:56:06,527
peering at us through
the cottage window.

1645
01:56:06,694 --> 01:56:09,238
Rebecca threatened him with the asylum.
That's why he was afraid to speak.

1646
01:56:09,405 --> 01:56:12,115
But he was always hanging about.
He must have seen this whole thing.

1647
01:56:12,283 --> 01:56:14,993
It's ridiculous,
even listening to all this.

1648
01:56:15,161 --> 01:56:18,038
You're like a little trade union,
all of you, aren't you?

1649
01:56:18,206 --> 01:56:20,249
And if my guess is right, Crawley,

1650
01:56:20,416 --> 01:56:23,502
there's a bit of malice in your soul
toward me, isn't there?

1651
01:56:23,670 --> 01:56:26,213
Crawley didn't have
much success with Rebecca,

1652
01:56:26,381 --> 01:56:29,216
but he ought to have
more luck this time.

1653
01:56:29,384 --> 01:56:32,261
And the bride will be grateful
for your fraternal arm, Crawley,

1654
01:56:32,428 --> 01:56:35,222
in a week or so.
Every time she faints, in fact.

1655
01:56:35,598 --> 01:56:38,016
- De Winter!
- Maxim, please!

1656
01:56:38,726 --> 01:56:40,519
That temper of yours
will do you in yet, Max.

1657
01:56:45,191 --> 01:56:46,984
Excuse me, gentlemen.

1658
01:56:47,860 --> 01:56:50,320
- Now is there anything else?
- Yes.

1659
01:56:51,406 --> 01:56:53,031
You might bring
Mr. De Winter a sedative.

1660
01:56:53,199 --> 01:56:55,576
- No, no. Nothing at all. Just leave us.
- Very good.

1661
01:56:58,955 --> 01:57:00,914
Now, Favell,
let's get this business over.

1662
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:20,000
https://t.me/RickyChannel

1663
01:57:01,082 --> 01:57:03,000
As you seem to have worked out
the whole thing so carefully,

1664
01:57:03,167 --> 01:57:04,668
perhaps you can provide us
also with a motive.

1665
01:57:04,836 --> 01:57:07,296
I knew you were going
to bring that up, Colonel.

1666
01:57:07,463 --> 01:57:11,383
I've read enough detective stories to
know that there must always be a motive.

1667
01:57:11,551 --> 01:57:14,636
And if you'll all excuse me,
I might supply that, too.

1668
01:57:16,264 --> 01:57:18,932
I wish you'd go home. You ought
not to be here through all this.

1669
01:57:19,100 --> 01:57:20,684
Please let me stay, Maxim.

1670
01:57:20,852 --> 01:57:23,062
Surely, Colonel Julyan, you're
not going to allow this fellow to...

1671
01:57:23,230 --> 01:57:26,190
My opinion of Favell
is no higher than yours, Crawley.

1672
01:57:26,358 --> 01:57:28,693
But in my official capacity,
I have no alternative

1673
01:57:28,861 --> 01:57:32,113
but to pursue his accusations.
I entirely agree with you, Colonel.

1674
01:57:32,281 --> 01:57:35,283
In matters as serious as this,
we must make sure of every point

1675
01:57:35,451 --> 01:57:37,452
and explore every avenue.

1676
01:57:37,786 --> 01:57:41,706
And in fact, if I may coin a phrase,
leave no stone unturned.

1677
01:57:42,124 --> 01:57:46,127
Here she is, the missing link, the
witness who will help supply the motive.

1678
01:57:46,587 --> 01:57:49,505
Colonel Julyan, Mrs. Danvers.
I believe you know everyone else.

1679
01:57:49,673 --> 01:57:50,715
Won't you sit down?

1680
01:57:50,883 --> 01:57:53,092
No offense, Colonel,
but I think I'll put this to Danny.

1681
01:57:53,260 --> 01:57:54,302
She'll understand it more easily.

1682
01:57:54,470 --> 01:57:56,804
Danny, who was Rebecca's doctor?

1683
01:57:57,139 --> 01:57:59,515
Mrs. De Winter always had Dr. McClean
from the village.

1684
01:57:59,683 --> 01:58:02,935
Now, you heard.
I said Rebecca's doctor in London.

1685
01:58:05,314 --> 01:58:06,439
I don't know anything about that.

1686
01:58:06,607 --> 01:58:09,025
Oh, don't give me that, Danny.
You knew everything about Rebecca.

1687
01:58:09,193 --> 01:58:11,235
You knew she was in love with me,
didn't you?

1688
01:58:11,403 --> 01:58:13,780
Surely you haven't forgotten
the good times she and I used to have

1689
01:58:13,947 --> 01:58:16,157
down at the cottage on the beach.

1690
01:58:16,325 --> 01:58:18,409
She had a right to amuse herself,
didn't she?

1691
01:58:18,577 --> 01:58:22,330
Love was a game to her. Only a game.
It made her laugh, I tell you.

1692
01:58:22,498 --> 01:58:24,999
She used to sit and rock with laughter
at the lot of you.

1693
01:58:25,167 --> 01:58:29,003
Can you think of why Mrs. De Winter
should have taken her own life?

1694
01:58:29,421 --> 01:58:30,630
No, no. I refuse to believe it.

1695
01:58:30,798 --> 01:58:32,548
I knew everything about her
and I won't believe it.

1696
01:58:32,716 --> 01:58:35,593
There. You see? It's impossible.
She knows that as well as I do.

1697
01:58:35,761 --> 01:58:36,803
Now, listen to me, Danny.

1698
01:58:36,970 --> 01:58:38,471
We know that Rebecca went
to a doctor in London

1699
01:58:38,639 --> 01:58:40,682
on the last day of her life. Who was it?

1700
01:58:40,891 --> 01:58:42,308
I don't know.

1701
01:58:42,685 --> 01:58:44,143
I understand, Danny.

1702
01:58:44,311 --> 01:58:47,146
You think we're asking you
to reveal secrets of Rebecca's life.

1703
01:58:47,314 --> 01:58:49,273
You're trying to defend her.
But that's what I'm doing.

1704
01:58:49,441 --> 01:58:52,026
I'm trying to clear her name
of the suspicion of suicide.

1705
01:58:52,194 --> 01:58:56,489
Mrs. Danvers, it has been suggested

1706
01:58:56,740 --> 01:58:58,533
that Mrs. De Winter
was deliberately murdered.

1707
01:58:58,702 --> 01:59:00,285
There you have it in a nutshell, Danny.

1708
01:59:00,453 --> 01:59:03,122
But there's one more thing you'll want
to know, the name of the murderer.

1709
01:59:03,289 --> 01:59:06,375
It's a lovely name
that rolls off the tongue so easily.

1710
01:59:06,543 --> 01:59:10,045
George Fortescue Maximilian de Winter.

1711
01:59:16,261 --> 01:59:17,886
There was a doctor.

1712
01:59:18,221 --> 01:59:20,222
Mrs. De Winter sometimes
went to him privately.

1713
01:59:20,390 --> 01:59:22,474
She used to go to him
even before she was married.

1714
01:59:22,642 --> 01:59:26,019
We don't want reminiscences, Danny.
What was his name?

1715
01:59:33,903 --> 01:59:36,864
Dr. Baker.
165 Goldhawk Road, Shepherd's Bush.

1716
01:59:37,031 --> 01:59:39,742
There you are, Colonel.
There's where you'll find your motive.

1717
01:59:39,909 --> 01:59:42,911
Go and question Dr. Baker.
He'll tell you why Rebecca went to him.

1718
01:59:43,079 --> 01:59:45,622
To confirm the fact
that she was going to have a child.

1719
01:59:45,790 --> 01:59:47,833
A sweet, curly-headed little child.

1720
01:59:48,001 --> 01:59:50,711
It isn't true. It isn't true.
She would have told me.

1721
01:59:50,920 --> 01:59:53,255
She told Max about it.
Max knew he wasn't the father.

1722
01:59:53,423 --> 01:59:56,884
So, like the gentleman of the old school
that he is, he killed her.

1723
01:59:57,051 --> 01:59:59,678
I'm afraid we shall
have to question this Dr. Baker.

1724
01:59:59,846 --> 02:00:03,515
Hear, hear. But for safety's sake,
I think I'd like to go along, too.

1725
02:00:03,683 --> 02:00:06,643
Yes. Unfortunately, I suppose
you have the right to ask that.

1726
02:00:06,811 --> 02:00:09,062
I'll see the coroner
and have the inquest postponed

1727
02:00:09,230 --> 02:00:10,272
pending further evidence.

1728
02:00:10,440 --> 02:00:14,193
I say, aren't you rather afraid that
the prisoner, shall we say, might bolt?

1729
02:00:14,611 --> 02:00:17,780
You have my word for it
that he will not do that.

1730
02:00:18,948 --> 02:00:20,657
Toodle-oo, Max. Come along, Danny.

1731
02:00:20,825 --> 02:00:25,412
Let's leave the unhappy couple to spend
their last moments together alone.

1732
02:00:35,841 --> 02:00:38,051
Are you sure you don't want me
to go with you, Max?

1733
02:00:38,219 --> 02:00:39,761
No, darling.
It'll be very tiring for you.

1734
02:00:39,929 --> 02:00:42,138
I'll be back the very first
thing in the morning.

1735
02:00:42,306 --> 02:00:45,475
- And I won't even stop to sleep.
- I'll be waiting for you.

1736
02:00:52,525 --> 02:00:54,025
- Ready, Maxim?
- Yes.

1737
02:00:54,193 --> 02:00:57,195
You two go on ahead.
I'll follow with Favell.

1738
02:01:10,876 --> 02:01:12,460
Dr. Baker, you may have seen

1739
02:01:12,628 --> 02:01:15,338
Mr. De Winter's name
in the papers recently.

1740
02:01:15,673 --> 02:01:18,967
Yes. Yes. In connection
with the body that was found in a boat.

1741
02:01:19,176 --> 02:01:22,595
My wife was reading all about it.
A very sad case. My condolences.

1742
02:01:22,763 --> 02:01:24,305
This is going to take hours.
Let me...

1743
02:01:24,473 --> 02:01:27,016
Don't bother, Favell.
I think I can tell Dr. Baker.

1744
02:01:27,184 --> 02:01:29,477
We're trying to discover certain facts

1745
02:01:29,645 --> 02:01:33,314
concerning the late Mrs. De Winter's
activities on the day of her death.

1746
02:01:33,482 --> 02:01:35,191
October the 12th, last year.

1747
02:01:35,359 --> 02:01:37,026
I want you to tell me if you can,

1748
02:01:37,194 --> 02:01:40,238
if anyone of that name
paid you a visit on that date?

1749
02:01:40,573 --> 02:01:42,991
I'm awfully sorry.
I'm afraid I can't help you.

1750
02:01:43,450 --> 02:01:45,869
I should have remembered
the name de Winter.

1751
02:01:46,036 --> 02:01:48,037
I've never attended
a Mrs. De Winter in my life.

1752
02:01:48,205 --> 02:01:51,082
How can you possibly tell
all your patients' names?

1753
02:01:51,250 --> 02:01:54,544
I can look it up in my engagement diary
if you like.

1754
02:01:55,379 --> 02:01:57,672
- Did you say the 12th of October?
Yes.

1755
02:01:58,716 --> 02:02:00,091
Here we are.

1756
02:02:00,384 --> 02:02:02,260
No. No de Winter.

1757
02:02:03,178 --> 02:02:04,429
Are you sure?

1758
02:02:04,597 --> 02:02:07,140
Well, here are all the appointments
for that day.

1759
02:02:07,349 --> 02:02:10,310
Ross, Campbell, Steadall,
Perrino, Danvers...

1760
02:02:10,477 --> 02:02:13,898
- Danny? What the devil?
- Would you read that name again?

1761
02:02:14,566 --> 02:02:16,358
Did you say Danvers?

1762
02:02:16,568 --> 02:02:18,694
Yes. I have a Mrs. Danvers for 3:00.

1763
02:02:18,862 --> 02:02:20,988
What did she look like?
Can you remember?

1764
02:02:21,156 --> 02:02:24,867
Yes, I remember her quite well.
She was a very beautiful woman.

1765
02:02:25,076 --> 02:02:28,412
- Tall, dark, exquisitely dressed.
Rebecca.

1766
02:02:28,705 --> 02:02:31,415
The lady must have used
an assumed name.

1767
02:02:31,583 --> 02:02:32,958
Is that so?

1768
02:02:33,585 --> 02:02:36,587
This is a surprise.
I've known her a long time.

1769
02:02:36,755 --> 02:02:38,923
What was the matter with her?

1770
02:02:39,382 --> 02:02:40,716
Well, there are certain ethics.

1771
02:02:40,884 --> 02:02:44,428
Could you supply a reason, Dr. Baker,
for Mrs. De Winter's suicide?

1772
02:02:44,596 --> 02:02:45,638
For her murder, you mean?

1773
02:02:45,805 --> 02:02:49,016
She was going to have a kid, wasn't she?
Come on. Out with it!

1774
02:02:49,184 --> 02:02:52,102
Tell me, what else would a woman of
her class be doing in a dump like this?

1775
02:02:52,270 --> 02:02:55,230
I take it the official nature of this
visit makes it necessary for me to...

1776
02:02:55,398 --> 02:02:59,360
I assure you we'd not be troubling you
if it were not necessary.

1777
02:02:59,945 --> 02:03:01,946
You want to know
if I can suggest any motive

1778
02:03:02,113 --> 02:03:05,074
as to why Mrs. De Winter
should have taken her life?

1779
02:03:05,241 --> 02:03:06,951
Yes, I think I can.

1780
02:03:10,538 --> 02:03:14,541
The woman who called herself
Mrs. Danvers was very seriously ill.

1781
02:03:15,293 --> 02:03:17,461
She was not going to have a child?

1782
02:03:17,629 --> 02:03:21,048
That was what she thought.
My diagnosis was different.

1783
02:03:21,967 --> 02:03:26,220
I sent her to a well-known specialist
for an examination and x-rays.

1784
02:03:27,263 --> 02:03:30,516
And on this date,
she returned to me for his report.

1785
02:03:30,976 --> 02:03:34,603
I remember her standing here
holding out her hand for the photograph.

1786
02:03:34,771 --> 02:03:36,438
"I want to know the truth, " she said.

1787
02:03:36,606 --> 02:03:39,316
"I don't want soft words
and a bedside manner.

1788
02:03:39,484 --> 02:03:42,444
If I'm for it,
you can tell me right away. "

1789
02:03:42,612 --> 02:03:44,780
I knew she was not the type
to accept a lie.

1790
02:03:44,948 --> 02:03:47,825
She'd asked for the truth,
so I let her have it.

1791
02:03:47,994 --> 02:03:51,454
She thanked me.
I never saw her again, so I assumed...

1792
02:03:52,665 --> 02:03:55,542
- What was wrong with her?
- Cancer.

1793
02:03:57,920 --> 02:04:00,171
Yes, the growth was deep-rooted.

1794
02:04:00,339 --> 02:04:03,133
An operation would have been
no earthly use at all.

1795
02:04:03,300 --> 02:04:05,802
In a short time,
she would have been under morphia.

1796
02:04:05,970 --> 02:04:08,805
There was nothing that could be done
for her, except wait.

1797
02:04:10,057 --> 02:04:13,059
Did she say anything
when you told her?

1798
02:04:14,353 --> 02:04:16,813
She smiled
in a queer sort of way.

1799
02:04:17,106 --> 02:04:20,150
Your wife was a wonderful woman,
Mr. De Winter.

1800
02:04:20,317 --> 02:04:22,318
And, oh, yes, I remember
she said something

1801
02:04:22,486 --> 02:04:25,155
that struck me
as being very peculiar at the time.

1802
02:04:25,698 --> 02:04:27,866
When I told her it was
a matter of months, she said,

1803
02:04:28,034 --> 02:04:30,368
"Oh, no, Doctor, not that long. "

1804
02:04:34,331 --> 02:04:37,542
You've been very kind.
You've told us all we wanted to know.

1805
02:04:37,710 --> 02:04:39,919
We shall need
an official verification.

1806
02:04:40,087 --> 02:04:41,296
- Verification?
- Yes.

1807
02:04:41,464 --> 02:04:44,132
- To confirm the verdict of suicide.
I understand.

1808
02:04:44,467 --> 02:04:46,134
Can I offer you gentlemen
a glass of sherry?

1809
02:04:46,302 --> 02:04:48,762
No, that's very kind.
I think we ought to be going.

1810
02:04:52,516 --> 02:04:54,184
Thank heaven we know the truth.

1811
02:04:54,351 --> 02:04:55,894
Dreadful thing. Dreadful.

1812
02:04:56,062 --> 02:04:59,064
Young and lovely woman like that.
No wonder...

1813
02:04:59,356 --> 02:05:03,568
I never had the remotest idea.
Neither did Danny, I'm sure.

1814
02:05:05,446 --> 02:05:06,529
I wish I had a drink.

1815
02:05:06,697 --> 02:05:08,865
Will we be needed at the inquest
any further, Colonel Julyan?

1816
02:05:09,033 --> 02:05:11,201
No, no. I can see to it
that Maxim's not troubled any further.

1817
02:05:11,368 --> 02:05:13,995
- Thank you, sir.
- You ready to start, Colonel?

1818
02:05:14,163 --> 02:05:16,915
No, thank you.
I'm staying in town tonight.

1819
02:05:17,083 --> 02:05:21,002
And let me tell you, Favell,
blackmail is not much of a profession.

1820
02:05:21,420 --> 02:05:23,296
And we know how to deal with it
in our part of the world,

1821
02:05:23,464 --> 02:05:24,465
strange as it may seem to you.

1822
02:05:24,633 --> 02:05:26,425
I'm sure I don't know
what you're talking about.

1823
02:05:26,593 --> 02:05:29,470
But if you ever need a new car, Colonel,
just let me know.

1824
02:05:30,472 --> 02:05:32,765
It's impossible to thank you for
your kindness to us through all this.

1825
02:05:32,933 --> 02:05:34,433
You know what I feel
without my saying it.

1826
02:05:34,601 --> 02:05:36,519
Not at all.
Put the whole thing behind you.

1827
02:05:36,686 --> 02:05:38,354
But let your wife know.
She'll be getting worried.

1828
02:05:38,522 --> 02:05:39,772
Yes, of course.
I'll phone her at once

1829
02:05:39,940 --> 02:05:41,357
and we'll get straight down
to Manderley.

1830
02:05:41,525 --> 02:05:44,401
Goodbye, Crawley.
Maxim's got a great friend.

1831
02:05:51,618 --> 02:05:53,369
- Frank.
- Yes, Maxim?

1832
02:05:56,164 --> 02:05:59,458
- There's something you don't know.
- Oh, no, there isn't.

1833
02:06:09,636 --> 02:06:11,637
I didn't kill her, Frank.

1834
02:06:12,472 --> 02:06:14,306
But I know now that when
she told me about the child,

1835
02:06:14,474 --> 02:06:16,016
she wanted me to kill her.

1836
02:06:16,184 --> 02:06:19,019
She lied on purpose.
She foresaw the whole thing.

1837
02:06:19,187 --> 02:06:21,814
That's why she stood there laughing
when she...

1838
02:06:21,982 --> 02:06:24,150
Don't think about it anymore.

1839
02:06:26,903 --> 02:06:28,529
Thank you, Frank.

1840
02:06:30,824 --> 02:06:33,993
Hello, Danny.
I just wanted to tell you the news.

1841
02:06:34,995 --> 02:06:38,080
Rebecca held out on both of us.
She had cancer.

1842
02:06:40,208 --> 02:06:41,667
Yes, suicide.

1843
02:06:43,253 --> 02:06:45,796
Now Max and that
dear little bride of his

1844
02:06:45,964 --> 02:06:49,425
will be able to stay on at Manderley
and live happily ever after.

1845
02:06:50,802 --> 02:06:52,344
Bye-bye, Danny.

1846
02:06:55,974 --> 02:06:58,893
- This your car, sir?
- Yes.

1847
02:06:59,186 --> 02:07:01,396
Will you be going soon?
This isn't a parking place, you know.

1848
02:07:01,564 --> 02:07:05,901
Oh, isn't it? Well, people are entitled
to leave cars outside if they want to.

1849
02:07:06,152 --> 02:07:09,738
It's a pity some of you fellows
haven't anything better to do.

1850
02:07:13,034 --> 02:07:15,785
When you phoned,
did she say she'd wait up?

1851
02:07:15,953 --> 02:07:19,039
I asked her to go to bed,
but she wouldn't hear of it.

1852
02:07:20,750 --> 02:07:23,543
I wish I could get some more speed
out of this thing.

1853
02:07:23,711 --> 02:07:25,712
Is something worrying you, Maxim?

1854
02:07:25,880 --> 02:07:28,924
I can't get over the feeling
something's wrong.

1855
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:20,000
https://t.me/RickyChannel

1856
02:08:16,639 --> 02:08:18,682
- Frank.
- What's the matter? Why did we stop?

1857
02:08:18,849 --> 02:08:20,433
What's the time?

1858
02:08:20,601 --> 02:08:23,520
Well, this clock's wrong.
It must be 3:00 or 4:00. Why?

1859
02:08:24,021 --> 02:08:26,147
That can't be
the dawn breaking over there.

1860
02:08:26,315 --> 02:08:29,609
It's in the winter that you see
the northern lights, isn't it?

1861
02:08:30,486 --> 02:08:33,655
That's not the northern lights.
That's Manderley.

1862
02:08:57,431 --> 02:08:58,431
Frith! Frith!

1863
02:08:58,598 --> 02:08:59,890
Mrs. De Winter. Where is she?

1864
02:09:00,058 --> 02:09:01,934
- I thought I saw her, sir.
- Where?

1865
02:09:09,693 --> 02:09:10,860
Maxim!

1866
02:09:12,529 --> 02:09:14,530
Thank heavens you've come back to me!

1867
02:09:14,698 --> 02:09:16,282
- Are you all right, darling?
- Oh, yes, I am.

1868
02:09:16,450 --> 02:09:17,450
Are you all right?

1869
02:09:18,785 --> 02:09:20,661
Mrs. Danvers, she's gone mad.

1870
02:09:20,829 --> 02:09:24,081
She said she'd rather destroy Manderley
than see us happy here.

1871
02:09:24,249 --> 02:09:26,167
Look! The west wing!
