1
00:02:22,415 --> 00:02:24,747
Hello, Mrs.
MacGruder. Hello, Miss Daniels.

2
00:02:24,817 --> 00:02:27,945
Have you ever seen so many
gulls? What do you suppose it is?

3
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:32,013
There must be a storm at sea.
That can drive them inland, you know.

4
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:35,617
I was hoping you'd be a
little late. He hasn't arrived yet.

5
00:02:35,728 --> 00:02:37,821
But you said 3:00. I know.

6
00:02:37,864 --> 00:02:40,560
I know. I've been calling all morning.

7
00:02:40,633 --> 00:02:42,863
Oh, Miss Daniels, you have no idea.

8
00:02:42,969 --> 00:02:45,733
They are so difficult
to get. Really, they are.

9
00:02:45,838 --> 00:02:48,636
We have to get them from India
when they're baby chicks, and then...

10
00:02:48,741 --> 00:02:50,641
This one won't be a chick, will he?

11
00:02:50,743 --> 00:02:54,975
Oh, no, certainly not. This
will be a full-grown mynah bird.

12
00:02:55,014 --> 00:02:58,950
- And he'll talk?
- Well, yes, of course he'll...

13
00:02:58,985 --> 00:03:02,477
Well, no, you'll
have to teach him to talk.

14
00:03:02,588 --> 00:03:06,615
I guess maybe I'd
better phone. They said 3:00.

15
00:03:06,726 --> 00:03:09,490
Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call.

16
00:03:09,595 --> 00:03:13,031
Would you mind waiting? Well,
maybe you'd better deliver him.

17
00:03:13,132 --> 00:03:15,123
Let me give you my address.

18
00:03:15,201 --> 00:03:17,726
Oh, well, all right,

19
00:03:17,804 --> 00:03:20,500
but I'm sure they're on the way.

20
00:03:20,606 --> 00:03:23,234
Would you mind if I called?

21
00:03:23,342 --> 00:03:25,242
No. All right.

22
00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:45,559
I wonder if you could help me. What?

23
00:03:45,631 --> 00:03:48,225
I said, I wonder if you could help me.

24
00:03:52,138 --> 00:03:55,164
Yes. What is it you're looking for, sir?

25
00:03:55,274 --> 00:03:56,764
- Lovebirds

26
00:03:56,876 --> 00:03:58,673
Lovebirds, sir? Yes. I

27
00:03:58,778 --> 00:04:00,405
understand there
are different varieties.

28
00:04:00,513 --> 00:04:02,811
Is that true? Well, yes, there are.

29
00:04:02,915 --> 00:04:05,782
Well, these are for my
sister for her birthday,

30
00:04:05,885 --> 00:04:09,013
and as she's only gonna be 11,
I wouldn't want a pair of birds...

31
00:04:09,121 --> 00:04:11,783
that were... too demonstrative.

32
00:04:11,824 --> 00:04:13,917
I understand completely. At the same

33
00:04:13,993 --> 00:04:15,961
time, I wouldn't
want them to be too aloof.

34
00:04:16,028 --> 00:04:18,019
No, of course not.

35
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:21,031
Do you happen to have a pair of
birds that are... just friendly?

36
00:04:21,133 --> 00:04:25,934
Oh, I think so. Now, then, let me see.

37
00:04:29,141 --> 00:04:31,609
Aren't those lovebirds?

38
00:04:31,644 --> 00:04:35,341
No. Those are, uh... red birds.

39
00:04:35,414 --> 00:04:37,848
I thought they were strawberry finches.

40
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:40,441
Yes. We call them that too.

41
00:04:42,355 --> 00:04:44,619
Here we are. Lovebirds.

42
00:04:46,225 --> 00:04:48,193
Those are canaries.

43
00:04:48,227 --> 00:04:50,627
Doesn't this make you feel awful?

44
00:04:50,663 --> 00:04:53,029
Doesn't what make me
feel... Having all these

45
00:04:53,065 --> 00:04:55,260
poor, innocent
creatures caged up like this?

46
00:04:55,368 --> 00:04:59,361
Well, we can't just let them
fly around the shop. I suppose not.

47
00:04:59,472 --> 00:05:03,704
Is there an ornithological reason
for keeping them in separate cages?

48
00:05:03,776 --> 00:05:06,074
Certainly. It's to protect the species.

49
00:05:06,112 --> 00:05:08,706
Yes, that's important,
especially during the molting season.

50
00:05:08,781 --> 00:05:11,477
That's a particularly dangerous time.

51
00:05:11,584 --> 00:05:14,951
Are they molting
now? Oh, some of them are.

52
00:05:14,987 --> 00:05:17,888
How can you tell?

53
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:22,188
Well, they... get a
sort of hangdog expression.

54
00:05:25,298 --> 00:05:27,892
Yes, I see. Well,
what about the lovebirds?

55
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,230
Are you sure you wouldn't
like to see a canary instead?

56
00:05:30,303 --> 00:05:34,330
We have some very nice
canaries this week. All right.

57
00:05:36,108 --> 00:05:39,009
All right. May I see it, please?

58
00:05:51,624 --> 00:05:53,524
Oh! Oh!

59
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,753
What is it? Oh! Oh!

60
00:05:58,197 --> 00:06:00,757
Oh! Oh! Oh!

61
00:06:01,667 --> 00:06:04,602
Oh! Oh!

62
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:13,078
There we are.

63
00:06:13,112 --> 00:06:15,103
Oh, there. Wonderful.

64
00:06:18,184 --> 00:06:20,675
Back in your gilded
cage, Melanie Daniels.

65
00:06:22,188 --> 00:06:24,486
What did you say?

66
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,888
I was merely drawing a
parallel, Miss Daniels.

67
00:06:26,993 --> 00:06:30,588
How did you know my
name? A little birdie told me.

68
00:06:30,696 --> 00:06:33,130
Good day, Miss Daniels. Madam.

69
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,397
Hey, wait a minute. I don't know you.

70
00:06:37,436 --> 00:06:40,030
Ah, but I know you. How?

71
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:41,629
We met in court.

72
00:06:41,741 --> 00:06:44,232
- We never met in court or anyplace else

73
00:06:44,343 --> 00:06:47,403
That's true. I'll rephrase
it. I saw you in court. When?

74
00:06:47,446 --> 00:06:49,539
Don't you remember one of your practical

75
00:06:49,615 --> 00:06:51,606
jokes that resulted in
the smashing of a window?

76
00:06:51,717 --> 00:06:55,084
- I didn't break that window.
- Yes, but your little prank did.

77
00:06:55,154 --> 00:06:57,884
The judge should've put you behind bars.

78
00:06:57,957 --> 00:06:59,754
- What are you, a policeman

79
00:06:59,792 --> 00:07:03,751
I merely believe in the law. And
I'm not too keen on practical jokers.

80
00:07:03,796 --> 00:07:05,855
What do you call your lovebird story...

81
00:07:05,965 --> 00:07:07,455
- I really wanted the lovebirds

82
00:07:07,566 --> 00:07:09,966
You knew I didn't work here. You

83
00:07:10,069 --> 00:07:12,469
deliberately... I
recognized you when I came in.

84
00:07:12,571 --> 00:07:14,266
I thought you might like to know what

85
00:07:14,373 --> 00:07:16,000
it's like to be on
the other end of a gag.

86
00:07:16,108 --> 00:07:18,975
What do you think of
that? I think you're a louse.

87
00:07:19,078 --> 00:07:22,707
I am. Good day, Miss Daniels. Madam.

88
00:07:23,783 --> 00:07:26,115
And I'm glad you
didn't get your lovebirds.

89
00:07:26,185 --> 00:07:30,087
I'll find something
else. See you in court.

90
00:07:33,192 --> 00:07:36,593
Who was that man? I have no idea.

91
00:08:02,188 --> 00:08:04,679
They said the mynah bird would be here

92
00:08:04,757 --> 00:08:07,157
later this afternoon,
if you care to come back.

93
00:08:07,193 --> 00:08:11,493
No, you'd better send him. May
I use this phone? Why, certainly.

94
00:08:21,474 --> 00:08:25,103
Daily News? It's Melanie
Daniels. Could you get me the City Desk?

95
00:08:25,177 --> 00:08:27,475
Just a minute, Mrs. MacGruder.

96
00:08:27,513 --> 00:08:30,710
Hello, Charlie. Melanie.

97
00:08:30,783 --> 00:08:33,718
I want you to do a favor for me.

98
00:08:33,786 --> 00:08:36,880
No, this is a small one.

99
00:08:36,989 --> 00:08:41,619
Pressure you? Why, Charlie,
darling, would I try to pressure you?

100
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:44,321
Would you call the
Department of Motor Vehicles for me?

101
00:08:44,396 --> 00:08:46,626
Find out who owns this license plate:

102
00:08:46,732 --> 00:08:49,997
W- J-H-0-0-3.

103
00:08:50,035 --> 00:08:52,833
Yes, a California plate.

104
00:08:52,905 --> 00:08:57,535
No. I'll stop off in a little
while. Is Daddy in his office?

105
00:08:57,643 --> 00:09:02,080
No, I don't want to break in on a
meeting. Tell him I'll see him later.

106
00:09:02,148 --> 00:09:04,241
Thank you, Charlie.

107
00:09:08,154 --> 00:09:10,179
Do you have any lovebirds?

108
00:09:10,289 --> 00:09:15,090
Well, no, not in the shop,
but I can order them for you.

109
00:09:15,161 --> 00:09:18,255
How soon? Well... Well,
when would you want them?

110
00:09:18,364 --> 00:09:20,161
Immediately. Well, I could probably

111
00:09:20,199 --> 00:09:21,962
have them here by tomorrow morning.

112
00:09:22,001 --> 00:09:25,960
Would that be all
right? That would be just fine.

113
00:10:15,621 --> 00:10:19,819
Miss, is that for Mitch Brenner? Yes.

114
00:10:19,858 --> 00:10:22,156
He's not home. That's all right.

115
00:10:22,228 --> 00:10:25,425
He won't be back until Monday...
I mean, if those birds are for him.

116
00:10:25,464 --> 00:10:27,432
Monday? Yes.

117
00:10:27,466 --> 00:10:29,627
I don't think you should leave them in

118
00:10:29,668 --> 00:10:31,659
the hall, do you?
Well... Where did he go?

119
00:10:31,737 --> 00:10:33,932
Bodega Bay. He goes there every weekend.

120
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:36,030
Bodega Bay. Where's that?

121
00:10:36,141 --> 00:10:38,439
Up the coast, about
60 miles north of here.

122
00:10:38,544 --> 00:10:40,671
Sixty mi... Oh!

123
00:10:40,779 --> 00:10:45,443
It's an hour and a half by freeway, or
two hours if you take the Coast Highway.

124
00:10:45,551 --> 00:10:48,850
I'd look after them
myself, but I'm going away too.

125
00:10:48,887 --> 00:10:51,856
I'm awfully sorry.

126
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,267
Good morning. Good morning.

127
00:12:43,335 --> 00:12:45,462
I wonder if you could
help me. I'll try my best.

128
00:12:45,571 --> 00:12:48,438
I'm looking for a man
named Mitchell Brenner. Yeah.

129
00:12:48,474 --> 00:12:50,465
Do you know him? Yeah.

130
00:12:50,576 --> 00:12:52,544
Where does he live?
Right here, Bodega Bay.

131
00:12:52,578 --> 00:12:56,605
- Yes, I know, but where?
- Right across the bay there.

132
00:12:56,715 --> 00:12:58,615
Where?

133
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:13,291
Now, see where I'm pointing? Yes.

134
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:15,629
See them two big trees across there?

135
00:13:15,701 --> 00:13:18,693
On the other side of the
bay? Yes. And the white house?

136
00:13:18,737 --> 00:13:20,705
Yes. That's where the Brenners live.

137
00:13:20,739 --> 00:13:23,606
The Brenners? Mr. And Mrs. Brenner?

138
00:13:23,642 --> 00:13:27,203
No. Just Lydia and the
two kids. The two kids?

139
00:13:27,246 --> 00:13:29,441
Yeah, Mitch and the little girl.

140
00:13:29,548 --> 00:13:32,210
Oh, I see. How do I get down there?

141
00:13:32,317 --> 00:13:34,547
You follow the road around the bay,

142
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,815
and that'll take
you to their front door.

143
00:13:36,922 --> 00:13:39,948
The front door. Is
there a back road I can take?

144
00:13:40,025 --> 00:13:43,654
No. That's the only road.
You see, I want to surprise them.

145
00:13:43,762 --> 00:13:45,662
Oh.

146
00:13:45,764 --> 00:13:48,426
I don't want them to see me arrive. Oh.

147
00:13:48,467 --> 00:13:51,163
It's a surprise, you see.

148
00:13:51,236 --> 00:13:53,602
Well, you could get yourself a boat and

149
00:13:53,705 --> 00:13:56,105
cut right across the bay to their dock.

150
00:13:56,175 --> 00:13:58,973
Where would I get a boat?

151
00:13:59,011 --> 00:14:01,605
Down by the Tides Restaurant.

152
00:14:01,713 --> 00:14:05,274
- Did you ever handle an outboard boat?
- Of course.

153
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:10,616
- Want me to order one for you?
- Well, thank you.

154
00:14:10,722 --> 00:14:12,747
What name? Daniels.

155
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:15,191
Okay.

156
00:14:27,606 --> 00:14:32,009
I wonder if you could tell
me... Yeah. Hold it a minute, please.

157
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:35,204
- The little girl's name?
- The little Brenner girl?

158
00:14:35,247 --> 00:14:37,613
Yes. Uh, Alice, I think.

159
00:14:37,649 --> 00:14:40,709
Harry, what's the Brenner girl's name?

160
00:14:40,819 --> 00:14:43,253
- Lois. Alice, isn't it?

161
00:14:43,355 --> 00:14:46,552
No, it's Lois.
- It's Alice.

162
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:51,426
Are you sure? Well, I'm not
positive, if that's what you mean.

163
00:14:51,463 --> 00:14:53,431
I need her exact name.

164
00:14:53,465 --> 00:14:56,798
Oh, uh... Just hold on
one more minute, please.

165
00:14:56,902 --> 00:14:59,370
In that case, I'll tell you what you do.

166
00:14:59,404 --> 00:15:02,703
Go straight through town till
you see a little hotel on your left.

167
00:15:02,774 --> 00:15:06,710
Then you turn right
there. Now, you got that? Yes.

168
00:15:06,778 --> 00:15:09,713
Near the top of the hill,
you'll see the school, and just beyond,

169
00:15:09,781 --> 00:15:12,181
a little house with a red mailbox.

170
00:15:12,217 --> 00:15:15,084
That's where Annie
Hayworth, the schoolteacher, lives.

171
00:15:15,187 --> 00:15:18,520
You ask her about the little
Brenner girl. Well, thank you.

172
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:22,185
Save yourself a lot of
trouble. Name's Alice for sure.

173
00:15:22,227 --> 00:15:25,196
Can I have the boat in about 20 minutes?

174
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:28,131
How much for the phone
calls? Oh, it's nothing.

175
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,395
Thank you.

176
00:16:22,688 --> 00:16:25,714
Who is it? Me.

177
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:27,782
Who's "me"?

178
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,998
Miss Hayworth? Yes.

179
00:16:34,032 --> 00:16:37,001
I'm Melanie Daniels. I'm
sorry to bother you, but... Yes?

180
00:16:37,102 --> 00:16:39,002
The man at the post office sent me.

181
00:16:39,104 --> 00:16:41,299
He said you could tell me
the name of the Brenner girl.

182
00:16:41,406 --> 00:16:43,738
Cathy? The one who lives in
the white house across the bay?

183
00:16:43,809 --> 00:16:47,404
That's the one. Cathy Brenner. He
seemed sure it was either Alice or Lois.

184
00:16:47,512 --> 00:16:49,104
Which is why the mail never gets

185
00:16:49,214 --> 00:16:50,841
delivered to the
right place in this town.

186
00:16:50,949 --> 00:16:53,213
I'm sorry. Smoke? Thank you.

187
00:16:54,186 --> 00:16:58,589
Did, uh... you want to
see Cathy about something?

188
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:00,749
Well, not exactly.

189
00:17:02,861 --> 00:17:05,261
Oh.

190
00:17:05,364 --> 00:17:08,697
Are you a friend of Mitch's?

191
00:17:08,767 --> 00:17:10,701
No, not really.

192
00:17:12,371 --> 00:17:14,805
I've been wanting a
cigarette for the last 20 minutes.

193
00:17:14,906 --> 00:17:17,170
I just couldn't convince myself to stop.

194
00:17:17,275 --> 00:17:19,175
This tilling of the soil can become

195
00:17:19,277 --> 00:17:21,211
compulsive, you know.
It's a very pretty garden.

196
00:17:21,313 --> 00:17:24,874
Oh, thank you. Well, it's
something to do in your spare time.

197
00:17:24,983 --> 00:17:28,214
There's a lot of
spare time in Bodega Bay.

198
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,380
Are, uh, you planning on staying long?

199
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:36,393
No, just a few hours. Then
you're leaving after you see Cathy.

200
00:17:36,428 --> 00:17:38,521
Well, something like that.

201
00:17:38,597 --> 00:17:40,827
I'm sorry. I don't
mean to sound so mysterious.

202
00:17:40,932 --> 00:17:43,526
Actually, it's none of my business.

203
00:17:43,602 --> 00:17:45,832
Well, I better be on my way.

204
00:17:45,937 --> 00:17:48,906
Thank you very much. Not at all.

205
00:17:52,944 --> 00:17:56,436
Did you drive up from San
Francisco by the coast road? Yes.

206
00:17:56,548 --> 00:17:58,982
Nice drive. It's very beautiful.

207
00:17:59,084 --> 00:18:01,279
Is that where you met Mitch?

208
00:18:03,121 --> 00:18:05,385
Yes.

209
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:08,687
I guess that's where
everyone meets Mitch.

210
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,354
Now you sound a bit
mysterious, Miss Hayworth.

211
00:18:11,396 --> 00:18:14,388
Do I?

212
00:18:14,499 --> 00:18:17,662
I don't mean to. Actually,
I'm an open book, I'm afraid.

213
00:18:17,769 --> 00:18:20,704
Or, rather, a closed one.

214
00:18:22,307 --> 00:18:25,606
- Oh, pretty. What are they?
- Lovebirds.

215
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:30,410
I see. Good luck, Miss Daniels.

216
00:18:30,515 --> 00:18:34,713
Thank you. Can I get out this way?

217
00:18:34,786 --> 00:18:37,755
Go right around. It'll
take you back to the main road.

218
00:18:37,789 --> 00:18:39,780
Thank you.

219
00:19:59,104 --> 00:20:02,039
Do you have a boat for
Miss Daniels? Yes, ma'am.

220
00:20:02,107 --> 00:20:04,405
It's the one right below.

221
00:25:34,606 --> 00:25:37,336
Are you all right? Yes, I think so.

222
00:25:37,408 --> 00:25:40,002
What made it do that? That's
the damnedest thing I ever saw.

223
00:25:40,111 --> 00:25:43,547
It seemed to swoop down at you
deliberately. Oh, you're bleeding too.

224
00:25:43,615 --> 00:25:46,550
Let's take care of that. Okay?

225
00:25:46,618 --> 00:25:48,813
That's a girl.

226
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,351
Come on.

227
00:25:59,864 --> 00:26:02,094
What happened, Mitch?

228
00:26:02,167 --> 00:26:04,397
Gull hit her. A gull?

229
00:26:07,272 --> 00:26:10,605
Oh. Let's try up at
the restaurant, all right?

230
00:26:13,478 --> 00:26:18,006
Might need a tetanus shot. I had a
booster before I went abroad last May.

231
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:48,338
What happened? Hello,
Deke. Young lady cut herself.

232
00:26:48,413 --> 00:26:52,509
Shall I call a doctor? I don't
think it's that serious. Let's see.

233
00:26:52,617 --> 00:26:56,075
Helen, get some cotton and antiseptic.

234
00:26:56,154 --> 00:26:58,987
Um, you cut yourself outside, miss?

235
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:01,524
Don't worry, Deke. She did it in a boat.

236
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:03,356
I had a man trip and
fall in the parking lot

237
00:27:03,394 --> 00:27:05,123
once. Sued me before
I could bat an eyelash.

238
00:27:05,163 --> 00:27:08,257
I don't think Miss Daniels
is gonna sue anybody. Here.

239
00:27:08,366 --> 00:27:10,800
Well, you're the lawyer. Thank you.

240
00:27:12,403 --> 00:27:14,871
What's that? Just some peroxide.

241
00:27:14,906 --> 00:27:16,999
I'll clean out the cut.

242
00:27:19,777 --> 00:27:21,711
So you're a lawyer.

243
00:27:21,779 --> 00:27:24,077
That's right. Of course, I usually

244
00:27:24,182 --> 00:27:26,377
defend people, but
if I were prosecuting...

245
00:27:26,417 --> 00:27:30,183
Do you practice here? Uh-uh, San
Francisco. What are you doing up here?

246
00:27:30,288 --> 00:27:32,984
What kind of law? Criminal.

247
00:27:33,024 --> 00:27:37,085
Is that why you want to see
everyone behind bars? Oh, not everyone.

248
00:27:37,195 --> 00:27:40,790
Only violators and
practical jokers. That's right.

249
00:27:40,832 --> 00:27:43,392
Ow! Oh, sorry.

250
00:27:43,501 --> 00:27:47,198
What are you doing up here?
Didn't you see the lovebirds?

251
00:27:48,906 --> 00:27:51,807
You mean, you came all this
way to bring me those birds?

252
00:27:51,843 --> 00:27:55,472
To bring your sister those
birds. You said it was her birthday.

253
00:27:55,546 --> 00:27:59,846
Besides, I was
coming up anyway. What for?

254
00:27:59,951 --> 00:28:02,886
To see a friend of mine. Careful.

255
00:28:02,954 --> 00:28:06,981
Oh, sorry. Uh... who's your friend?

256
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:10,884
Annie Hayworth, the schoolteacher.

257
00:28:10,962 --> 00:28:13,863
Annie Hayworth.

258
00:28:13,965 --> 00:28:15,865
Well, small world.

259
00:28:15,967 --> 00:28:17,867
Yes.

260
00:28:19,671 --> 00:28:21,798
How do you know Annie?

261
00:28:21,873 --> 00:28:25,866
We went to school together... college.

262
00:28:25,977 --> 00:28:30,505
Did you? Imagine that. How
long are you staying up here?

263
00:28:32,116 --> 00:28:34,710
The weekend.

264
00:28:34,786 --> 00:28:38,882
Well, I think the bleeding's almost
stopped. Why don't you hold that on...

265
00:28:47,432 --> 00:28:50,629
So you came up to see Annie, huh? Yes.

266
00:28:50,735 --> 00:28:52,794
I think you came up to see me. Now, why

267
00:28:52,837 --> 00:28:54,737
would I want to see you of all people?

268
00:28:54,772 --> 00:28:57,434
I don't know, but you
must've gone to a lot of trouble...

269
00:28:57,542 --> 00:28:59,533
to find out who I was and where I lived.

270
00:28:59,644 --> 00:29:02,545
It was no trouble at all. I
simply called my father's newspaper.

271
00:29:02,647 --> 00:29:06,344
Besides, I was coming up
anyway. I've already told you that.

272
00:29:06,384 --> 00:29:08,477
You really like me, huh?

273
00:29:08,553 --> 00:29:13,081
I loathe you. You have no
manners. You're arrogant and conceited.

274
00:29:13,157 --> 00:29:16,354
I wrote you a letter about
it, in fact, but I tore it up.

275
00:29:16,394 --> 00:29:19,557
- What did it say?
- None of your business.

276
00:29:19,664 --> 00:29:22,690
I can't say I like
your seagulls much, either.

277
00:29:22,767 --> 00:29:25,565
I come all the way up here to...
You were coming up anyway, remember?

278
00:29:29,874 --> 00:29:31,774
Mitch?

279
00:29:31,876 --> 00:29:34,970
I thought I saw your car.
What are you doing in town?

280
00:29:35,012 --> 00:29:37,606
I had to
acknowledge a delivery. A what?

281
00:29:37,715 --> 00:29:39,307
Mother, I'd like you to meet

282
00:29:39,384 --> 00:29:41,011
Melanie Daniels.
Miss Daniels, my mother.

283
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:43,679
How do you do?

284
00:29:43,788 --> 00:29:46,916
How do you do, Miss
Daniels? Acknowledge a what?

285
00:29:46,991 --> 00:29:50,392
A delivery. Miss Daniels brought
us some birds from San Francisco.

286
00:29:50,428 --> 00:29:53,022
Oh. For Cathy for her
birthday. Where is she?

287
00:29:53,131 --> 00:29:54,826
Across at Brinkmeyer's. Miss Daniels

288
00:29:54,932 --> 00:29:56,593
is staying up here for the weekend.

289
00:29:56,634 --> 00:29:59,626
So I've already
invited her for dinner tonight.

290
00:30:03,408 --> 00:30:05,399
Well, you did go to the trouble of

291
00:30:05,443 --> 00:30:07,343
bringing those birds.
Oh, I couldn't possibly.

292
00:30:07,412 --> 00:30:11,405
You did say birds? Yes, lovebirds.

293
00:30:11,516 --> 00:30:13,416
Oh, I see.

294
00:30:17,054 --> 00:30:20,615
So we couldn't let you get away
without thanking you in some small way.

295
00:30:20,725 --> 00:30:23,057
And you haven't met Cathy,
and you are staying the weekend.

296
00:30:23,161 --> 00:30:25,561
Well, yes, but... You are, aren't you?

297
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:27,928
Certainly, but... Then it's all settled.

298
00:30:28,032 --> 00:30:30,626
What time is dinner,
Mother? 7:00, the same as usual.

299
00:30:30,668 --> 00:30:32,863
I'll pick you up. Where are you staying?

300
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:34,460
- With Annie, of course

301
00:30:34,572 --> 00:30:38,565
Oh, of course. How
stupid of me. A quarter of 7:00?

302
00:30:38,643 --> 00:30:41,441
Annie may have made
other plans. I'll have to see.

303
00:30:41,479 --> 00:30:44,039
Besides, I can find my own way.

304
00:30:44,081 --> 00:30:46,845
You're sure now? You
won't hire a boat or anything?

305
00:30:46,884 --> 00:30:49,478
I'm sure. 7:00, then.

306
00:30:49,587 --> 00:30:51,578
Maybe.

307
00:30:51,656 --> 00:30:53,817
We'll be waiting for
you. How's your head?

308
00:30:53,925 --> 00:30:55,916
Much better, thank you.

309
00:30:55,993 --> 00:30:59,087
A gull hit me, Mrs. Brenner, that's all.

310
00:31:12,143 --> 00:31:15,806
Oh, hi. Did you find
her all right? Yes, I did.

311
00:31:15,913 --> 00:31:18,143
I was wondering...

312
00:31:18,216 --> 00:31:21,014
Uh, that sign there.

313
00:31:21,118 --> 00:31:24,713
Do you suppose I could have
the room for just a single night?

314
00:31:24,822 --> 00:31:27,757
I was planning on renting it for a
longer time... I would appreciate it.

315
00:31:27,825 --> 00:31:31,226
I've tried everywhere
in town. They're all full.

316
00:31:31,262 --> 00:31:34,425
Well, all right. Got
your bags in the car?

317
00:31:35,766 --> 00:31:38,735
Well, it's utilitarian, I'll say that.

318
00:31:38,836 --> 00:31:41,737
I just picked up some things
for the night at the general store.

319
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:44,831
I hadn't planned on staying very long.

320
00:31:44,942 --> 00:31:48,776
Yes, I know. Did
something unexpected come up?

321
00:31:50,448 --> 00:31:53,679
Yes. May I use your
phone? I'd like to call home.

322
00:31:53,784 --> 00:31:56,981
I just put some coffee on the stove.

323
00:31:57,021 --> 00:32:01,185
Don't they ever stop migrating?

324
00:32:56,514 --> 00:32:58,482
Hi!

325
00:33:00,618 --> 00:33:02,950
Hi!

326
00:33:02,987 --> 00:33:05,182
Miss Daniels? Yes.

327
00:33:06,591 --> 00:33:08,718
Oh, they're beautiful!

328
00:33:08,793 --> 00:33:11,785
They're just what I
wanted. Is there a man and a woman?

329
00:33:11,829 --> 00:33:15,788
I can't tell which is
which. Well, I suppose so.

330
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:18,494
Hello there. Annie
had no plans, huh? No.

331
00:33:18,603 --> 00:33:20,503
We're very glad you
could come. Are you hungry?

332
00:33:20,605 --> 00:33:22,835
Reasonably. Dinner's just about ready.

333
00:33:22,907 --> 00:33:25,842
We've been looking at the chickens.
Something seems to be wrong with them.

334
00:33:25,943 --> 00:33:27,911
There's nothing
wrong with those chickens.

335
00:33:28,012 --> 00:33:30,810
I'm going to call Fred Brinkmeyer
right now. What good's that gonna do?

336
00:33:30,915 --> 00:33:32,906
The chickens won't eat.

337
00:33:33,017 --> 00:33:35,212
He sold the feed to me, didn't he?

338
00:33:35,319 --> 00:33:38,914
Caveat emptor, Mother. Let the
buyer beware. Whose side are you on?

339
00:33:39,023 --> 00:33:42,254
Merely quoting the law,
dear. Never mind the law.

340
00:33:48,866 --> 00:33:52,962
This won't take long, Miss
Dan... Hello, Fred? Lydia Brenner.

341
00:33:53,037 --> 00:33:55,267
I didn't interrupt your
dinner, did I? How about a drink?

342
00:33:55,373 --> 00:33:59,400
I'd love one. That
feed you sold me is no good.

343
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:04,777
The chicken feed. Well, it's just
no good. The chickens won't eat it.

344
00:34:04,882 --> 00:34:06,975
They're always hungry.

345
00:34:07,018 --> 00:34:10,112
I opened a sack for them when I got
home, and they just wouldn't touch it.

346
00:34:10,187 --> 00:34:12,587
You know chickens as well as
I do, and when they won't eat,

347
00:34:12,623 --> 00:34:15,888
there's something wrong
with what they're being fed.

348
00:34:15,993 --> 00:34:19,895
No, they're not fussy chickens.

349
00:34:19,997 --> 00:34:23,125
Who? What's he got to do with it?

350
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,998
Is that your father?
Mm-hmm. Please sit down.

351
00:34:26,037 --> 00:34:30,235
I don't care how many sacks of
feed you sold him. My chicken...

352
00:34:31,842 --> 00:34:35,005
Oh, I see.

353
00:34:35,112 --> 00:34:37,410
Dan Fawcett.

354
00:34:37,515 --> 00:34:41,451
This afternoon? That proves what
I'm saying. The feed you sold us...

355
00:34:43,788 --> 00:34:47,019
Oh.

356
00:34:47,124 --> 00:34:50,719
Well, maybe I
better go over and see him.

357
00:34:50,795 --> 00:34:54,492
You don't think there's
something going around, do you?

358
00:34:54,565 --> 00:34:56,999
No, never!

359
00:34:57,068 --> 00:35:01,471
No, they don't seem sick
at all. They just won't eat.

360
00:35:01,505 --> 00:35:04,872
Uh-huh.

361
00:35:04,909 --> 00:35:09,505
Well, I'll try to go
over and see him. Maybe he...

362
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:12,515
Uh-huh. All right.

363
00:35:12,583 --> 00:35:15,074
Thanks.

364
00:35:16,921 --> 00:35:19,788
He had a call from
Dan Fawcett a while ago.

365
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:21,790
His chickens won't eat either.

366
00:35:21,892 --> 00:35:25,328
It's what you said, Mom. Mr.
Brinkmeyer's feed is no good.

367
00:35:25,396 --> 00:35:29,025
No, Cathy. He sold Mr.
Fawcett a different brand.

368
00:35:29,133 --> 00:35:32,591
You don't think they're
getting sick, do you, Mitch?

369
00:35:38,542 --> 00:35:40,942
I still don't understand how you knew I

370
00:35:41,011 --> 00:35:43,343
wanted lovebirds. Your brother told me.

371
00:35:43,414 --> 00:35:47,248
Then you knew Mitch in
San Francisco? Is that right?

372
00:35:47,351 --> 00:35:49,342
No, not exactly.

373
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:51,820
Mitch knows a lot of people in San

374
00:35:51,922 --> 00:35:54,117
Francisco. Of
course, they're mostly hoods.

375
00:35:54,158 --> 00:35:58,151
- Cathy!
- Well, Mom, he's the first to admit it.

376
00:35:58,195 --> 00:36:01,961
He's spends half his day in the
detention cells at the Hall of Justice.

377
00:36:01,999 --> 00:36:05,298
In a democracy, Cathy,
everyone is entitled to a fair trial.

378
00:36:05,369 --> 00:36:08,167
Your brother's
practice... Aw, Mom, please!

379
00:36:08,205 --> 00:36:11,402
I know all that democracy
jazz. They're still hoods.

380
00:36:14,078 --> 00:36:17,707
He has a client now who shot
his wife in the head six times.

381
00:36:17,782 --> 00:36:20,910
Six times! Can you imagine it?

382
00:36:20,985 --> 00:36:25,012
I mean, even twice would be
overdoing it, don't you think?

383
00:36:25,122 --> 00:36:26,612
Why did he shoot her?

384
00:36:26,724 --> 00:36:28,919
- He was watching a
ball game on television

385
00:36:28,993 --> 00:36:31,985
- What?
- His wife changed the channel.

386
00:36:33,731 --> 00:36:37,189
Are you coming to my party
tomorrow? I don't think so.

387
00:36:37,234 --> 00:36:39,702
I have to get back to San Francisco.

388
00:36:39,737 --> 00:36:41,728
Don't you like us?

389
00:36:41,806 --> 00:36:44,240
Oh, darling, of course I do.

390
00:36:44,308 --> 00:36:47,141
Don't you like Bodega
Bay? I don't know yet.

391
00:36:47,211 --> 00:36:50,738
Mitch likes it very much. He
comes up every weekend, you know,

392
00:36:50,815 --> 00:36:53,648
even though he has his
own apartment in the city.

393
00:36:53,751 --> 00:36:57,084
He says San Francisco's like an
anthill at the foot of a bridge.

394
00:36:57,154 --> 00:36:59,679
I suppose it does get hectic at times.

395
00:36:59,757 --> 00:37:04,091
Well, if you do decide to
come, don't say I told you about it.

396
00:37:04,161 --> 00:37:06,356
It's supposed to be a surprise party.

397
00:37:06,397 --> 00:37:09,560
They've got this whole
complicated thing figured out...

398
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,068
where I'm going to
Michele's for the afternoon,

399
00:37:12,169 --> 00:37:14,160
and Michele's mother
will say that she has a

400
00:37:14,271 --> 00:37:16,205
headache, would I
mind if she took me home.

401
00:37:16,307 --> 00:37:19,367
Then when I get home
here, all the kids'll jump out!

402
00:37:21,579 --> 00:37:25,481
Oh, won't you come?
Won't you please come?

403
00:37:28,185 --> 00:37:30,176
I don't think so.

404
00:37:32,423 --> 00:37:35,984
She's a charming girl,
isn't she, Mitch? Hmm? Yes.

405
00:37:36,026 --> 00:37:38,392
Certainly pretty. Mm-hmm.

406
00:37:38,495 --> 00:37:40,190
How long have you known her?

407
00:37:40,231 --> 00:37:42,529
- Now, I told you,
dear, we met yesterday

408
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,795
In a bird shop. In a bird shop.

409
00:37:44,835 --> 00:37:46,803
She was selling birds?

410
00:37:46,904 --> 00:37:48,997
No, no. I just led her into believing

411
00:37:49,106 --> 00:37:51,097
that I believed she was, and then...

412
00:37:51,208 --> 00:37:53,108
It's all very
complicated. But she did buy

413
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:54,939
the lovebirds and then
drove all the way here.

414
00:37:55,045 --> 00:37:56,945
Mother. Yes?

415
00:37:57,047 --> 00:38:00,380
Where did you go to law school?

416
00:38:00,484 --> 00:38:02,384
Forgive me.

417
00:38:02,486 --> 00:38:05,978
I suppose I'm just naturally
curious about a girl like that.

418
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:07,990
She's very rich, isn't she?

419
00:38:08,092 --> 00:38:11,687
Yeah, I suppose so. Her father's
part owner of one of the big newspapers.

420
00:38:11,762 --> 00:38:14,959
You'd think he could manage
to keep her name out of print.

421
00:38:14,999 --> 00:38:18,958
She's always mentioned in
the columns, Mitch. Yes, I know.

422
00:38:19,003 --> 00:38:23,872
She is the one who jumped into a
fountain in Rome last summer, isn't she?

423
00:38:23,974 --> 00:38:25,908
Yes.

424
00:38:25,976 --> 00:38:28,274
I supposed I'm old-fashioned. I know it

425
00:38:28,379 --> 00:38:30,574
was supposed to be
very warm there, but...

426
00:38:30,614 --> 00:38:35,108
Well, actually the newspapers
said she was naked. Yes, I know, dear.

427
00:38:35,185 --> 00:38:38,018
It's none of my business, but
when you bring a girl like that...

428
00:38:38,122 --> 00:38:40,386
Darling? Yes?

429
00:38:40,424 --> 00:38:44,155
I think I can handle
Melanie Daniels by myself.

430
00:38:44,194 --> 00:38:48,187
Well... as long as you
know what you want, Mitch.

431
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,194
I know exactly what I want.

432
00:38:57,341 --> 00:39:00,777
Be able to find your
way back all right? Oh, yes.

433
00:39:02,947 --> 00:39:06,383
Will I be seeing you again? San
Francisco's a long way from here.

434
00:39:06,483 --> 00:39:09,247
I'm in San Francisco five days a
week with a lot of time on my hands.

435
00:39:09,353 --> 00:39:12,948
I'd like to see you. Maybe we
could go swimming or something.

436
00:39:13,057 --> 00:39:15,548
Mother tells me you like to swim.

437
00:39:15,659 --> 00:39:19,356
How does Mother know what I like
to do? We read the same gossip column.

438
00:39:19,463 --> 00:39:23,797
Oh, that... Rome. I really like to
swim. We might get along very well.

439
00:39:23,901 --> 00:39:25,766
In case you're interested, I was pushed

440
00:39:25,803 --> 00:39:27,566
into that fountain.
Without any clothes on?

441
00:39:27,604 --> 00:39:30,573
With all my clothes on. The
newspaper that ran that story...

442
00:39:30,674 --> 00:39:32,767
happens to be a
rival of my father's paper.

443
00:39:32,876 --> 00:39:34,571
You were just a poor, innocent victim of

444
00:39:34,678 --> 00:39:36,475
circumstances? I'm
neither poor nor innocent.

445
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:38,377
The truth of that
particular... The truth is,

446
00:39:38,415 --> 00:39:40,315
you're running around
with a pretty wild crowd.

447
00:39:40,384 --> 00:39:41,976
Yes, that's the truth, but I was pushed

448
00:39:42,086 --> 00:39:43,883
into that fountain,
and that's the truth too.

449
00:39:43,988 --> 00:39:47,389
Uh-huh. Do you
really know Annie Hayworth?

450
00:39:47,424 --> 00:39:49,915
No. At least I
didn't until I came up here.

451
00:39:49,994 --> 00:39:51,928
So you didn't go to school together? No.

452
00:39:51,996 --> 00:39:53,930
And you didn't come here to see her? No!

453
00:39:53,998 --> 00:39:55,989
You were lying! Yes, I was lying.

454
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:59,035
What about the letter you wrote me?
Is that a lie? No, I wrote the letter.

455
00:39:59,136 --> 00:40:02,401
- Well, what did it say?
- It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner.

456
00:40:02,506 --> 00:40:04,337
I think you need these lovebirds after

457
00:40:04,408 --> 00:40:06,205
all. They may help your personality."

458
00:40:06,243 --> 00:40:08,336
That's what it said. But you tore it up?

459
00:40:08,412 --> 00:40:09,936
Yes. Why?

460
00:40:10,014 --> 00:40:12,312
Because it seemed stupid and foolish.

461
00:40:12,416 --> 00:40:15,544
- Like jumping into a fountain in Rome.
- I told you what happened!

462
00:40:15,619 --> 00:40:17,416
You don't expect me
to believe that, do you?

463
00:40:17,454 --> 00:40:19,445
I don't give a damn what you believe!

464
00:40:19,556 --> 00:40:22,024
- I'd still like to see you.
- Why?

465
00:40:22,126 --> 00:40:23,616
I think it might be fun.

466
00:40:23,727 --> 00:40:27,128
That might've been good enough in
Rome, but it's not good enough now.

467
00:40:27,231 --> 00:40:28,721
It is for me. Well, not for me.

468
00:40:28,832 --> 00:40:31,232
- What do you want?
- I thought you knew.

469
00:40:31,268 --> 00:40:33,566
I want to go through life...

470
00:40:33,637 --> 00:40:35,867
jumping into
fountains naked. Good night.

471
00:40:54,425 --> 00:40:57,189
Miss Daniels, is that you? Yes.

472
00:40:57,294 --> 00:40:59,524
Hi.

473
00:40:59,596 --> 00:41:03,123
Is something wrong? Is that
cut beginning to bother you?

474
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,430
No, it's not the
cut that's bothering me.

475
00:41:07,004 --> 00:41:10,804
- Would you like some brandy?
- If you have some, I'd love it.

476
00:41:10,908 --> 00:41:13,399
I'll get it. Why don't you sit down.

477
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:16,536
Oh, would you like a
sweater or something, a quilt?

478
00:41:16,613 --> 00:41:18,911
No. No, thank you.

479
00:41:21,518 --> 00:41:23,611
Won't you call me Melanie?

480
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,654
All right.

481
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:36,461
Thank you. Gets a bit
chilly here at night sometimes,

482
00:41:36,533 --> 00:41:40,128
especially if you're over near the bay.

483
00:41:40,237 --> 00:41:42,831
Well, how did your evening go?

484
00:41:44,341 --> 00:41:46,866
Did you meet Lydia?

485
00:41:46,977 --> 00:41:49,878
Or would you rather
I changed the subject?

486
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,971
I think so.

487
00:41:53,784 --> 00:41:57,185
Well, how do you like our little hamlet?

488
00:41:57,287 --> 00:41:58,777
- I despise it

489
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:02,759
I suppose it doesn't offer
much to the casual visitor,

490
00:42:02,793 --> 00:42:05,785
unless you're thrilled by a
collection of shacks on a hillside.

491
00:42:05,896 --> 00:42:08,091
It takes a bit of getting used to.

492
00:42:08,198 --> 00:42:11,031
Where are you from
originally? San Francisco.

493
00:42:11,135 --> 00:42:14,400
How did you happen to come up here?

494
00:42:15,806 --> 00:42:20,402
A friend invited me up
for a weekend a long time ago.

495
00:42:21,612 --> 00:42:24,308
Look, I see no reason
for being coy about this.

496
00:42:24,414 --> 00:42:28,111
It was Mitch Brenner. I guess you
knew that anyway. I suspected as much.

497
00:42:28,218 --> 00:42:30,550
Well, you needn't worry.

498
00:42:30,621 --> 00:42:33,556
It's been over and
done with a long time ago.

499
00:42:33,624 --> 00:42:38,459
Annie, there's nothing between
Mr. Brenner and me. Isn't there?

500
00:42:38,562 --> 00:42:41,224
Well, maybe there isn't.

501
00:42:41,265 --> 00:42:43,961
Maybe there's never been
anything between Mitch and any girl.

502
00:42:44,034 --> 00:42:46,867
What do you mean?

503
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:50,064
I think I'll have some of that.

504
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:52,938
I was seeing a lot
of him in San Francisco.

505
00:42:52,976 --> 00:42:55,103
One weekend, he
invited me up to meet Lydia.

506
00:42:55,179 --> 00:42:56,703
When was this?

507
00:42:56,780 --> 00:43:00,716
- Oh, four years ago,
shortly after his father died

508
00:43:00,784 --> 00:43:05,016
Of course, things may be
different now. Different?

509
00:43:05,122 --> 00:43:07,818
With Lydia.

510
00:43:07,925 --> 00:43:11,986
Did she seem a trifle
distant? Mm, a trifle.

511
00:43:12,029 --> 00:43:15,328
Well, then perhaps things
aren't quite so different.

512
00:43:15,399 --> 00:43:18,891
You know, her
attitude nearly drove me crazy.

513
00:43:19,002 --> 00:43:21,800
When I got back to San Francisco,
I spent days trying to figure out...

514
00:43:21,838 --> 00:43:23,806
what I'd done to displease her.

515
00:43:23,907 --> 00:43:27,843
- Well, what had you done?
- Nothing.

516
00:43:27,945 --> 00:43:32,609
I simply existed. So what's
the answer? A jealous woman, right?

517
00:43:32,716 --> 00:43:34,650
A clinging, possessive mother?

518
00:43:34,751 --> 00:43:36,742
Wrong. With all due respect to

519
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:38,754
Oedipus, I don't
think that was the case.

520
00:43:38,822 --> 00:43:41,848
Then what was it?

521
00:43:41,959 --> 00:43:44,951
Lydia liked me. That's the strange part.

522
00:43:45,028 --> 00:43:47,963
Now that I'm no longer a
threat, we're very good friends.

523
00:43:48,031 --> 00:43:52,468
- Then why did she object to you?
- Because she was afraid.

524
00:43:52,569 --> 00:43:56,767
- Afraid you'd take Mitch?
- Afraid I'd give Mitch.

525
00:43:56,807 --> 00:43:58,775
I don't understand.

526
00:43:58,809 --> 00:44:00,868
Afraid of any woman who would give Mitch

527
00:44:00,978 --> 00:44:02,912
the one thing Lydia can give him: Love.

528
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:05,505
That adds up to a
jealous, possessive woman.

529
00:44:05,582 --> 00:44:08,710
No, I don't think so.

530
00:44:08,785 --> 00:44:11,982
You see, she's not
afraid of losing Mitch.

531
00:44:12,022 --> 00:44:14,320
She's only afraid of being abandoned.

532
00:44:14,391 --> 00:44:18,828
- Someone ought to tell her
she'd be gaining a daughter.

533
00:44:18,929 --> 00:44:21,921
No. She already has a daughter.

534
00:44:21,999 --> 00:44:26,993
Well, what about Mitch? Didn't
he have anything to say about this?

535
00:44:27,104 --> 00:44:29,698
Well, I can understand his position.

536
00:44:29,806 --> 00:44:32,604
He'd just been through a lot
with Lydia after his father died.

537
00:44:32,643 --> 00:44:35,407
He didn't want to risk
going through it all again.

538
00:44:35,512 --> 00:44:37,002
- Oh, I see

539
00:44:37,114 --> 00:44:39,605
So it ended. Not right then, of course.

540
00:44:39,716 --> 00:44:42,150
We went back to San Francisco, saw each

541
00:44:42,219 --> 00:44:44,619
other now and then, but
we both knew it was over.

542
00:44:44,721 --> 00:44:47,554
Then what are you
doing here in Bodega Bay?

543
00:44:47,624 --> 00:44:49,319
- I wanted to be near Mitch

544
00:44:49,426 --> 00:44:52,953
Oh, it was over and done
with, and I knew it, but...

545
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:55,999
I still wanted to be near him.

546
00:44:56,099 --> 00:44:59,091
I still like him a hell of a lot,

547
00:44:59,169 --> 00:45:02,969
and I don't want to
lose that friendship... ever.

548
00:45:11,114 --> 00:45:15,175
Hello.

549
00:45:15,285 --> 00:45:18,220
No, no, no, I wasn't asleep.

550
00:45:18,322 --> 00:45:21,382
Yes, just a little while ago.

551
00:45:21,491 --> 00:45:23,755
Sure. Hold on.

552
00:45:23,794 --> 00:45:25,785
It's Mitch.

553
00:45:25,829 --> 00:45:27,797
For you.

554
00:45:35,505 --> 00:45:38,838
Hello? Oh, yes, this is Melanie.

555
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:42,303
Fine, thank you.

556
00:45:42,412 --> 00:45:46,143
No, no trouble at all. I
simply followed the road.

557
00:45:47,517 --> 00:45:50,714
Well... There's no need to apologize.

558
00:45:50,821 --> 00:45:53,255
I can understand...

559
00:45:54,558 --> 00:45:57,755
That's very kind of
you. No, I'm not angry.

560
00:46:01,198 --> 00:46:05,362
Well, I couldn't. I have
to get back to San Francisco.

561
00:46:06,903 --> 00:46:09,872
No, I wouldn't want to
disappoint Cathy, but...

562
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:15,610
I see.

563
00:46:17,481 --> 00:46:20,177
All right. Yes, I'll be there.

564
00:46:20,283 --> 00:46:22,376
Good night, Mitch.

565
00:46:24,988 --> 00:46:29,322
He wants me to go to Cathy's party
tomorrow afternoon. I said I would.

566
00:46:29,393 --> 00:46:31,384
It should be fun.

567
00:46:31,495 --> 00:46:34,191
I'll be there, too, to help.

568
00:46:34,231 --> 00:46:37,200
Oh, it seems so pointless.

569
00:46:37,234 --> 00:46:41,193
Well, I think I'll go to
sleep. It's been a busy day.

570
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:48,444
My luggage.

571
00:46:52,015 --> 00:46:54,984
That's pretty. Where'd
you get that? Brinkmeyer's?

572
00:46:55,085 --> 00:46:58,543
Mm-hmm. Do you think I should go?

573
00:46:58,655 --> 00:47:00,885
Well, that's up to you.

574
00:47:00,957 --> 00:47:03,482
No, it's really up to Lydia, isn't it?

575
00:47:05,362 --> 00:47:10,390
- Never mind Lydia. Do you want to go?
- Yes.

576
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:13,958
- Then go.
- Thank you, Annie.

577
00:47:16,072 --> 00:47:18,905
Oh. Wonder who that can be.

578
00:47:18,975 --> 00:47:21,068
Is someone there?

579
00:47:21,178 --> 00:47:24,978
Who is it? Look.

580
00:47:26,483 --> 00:47:31,011
Poor thing. Probably
lost his way in the dark.

581
00:47:31,121 --> 00:47:33,783
But it isn't dark, Annie.

582
00:47:33,890 --> 00:47:35,983
There's a full moon.

583
00:47:44,701 --> 00:47:47,727
Cathy, that's very good. Very good.

584
00:47:49,906 --> 00:47:52,204
Okay. Here we go.

585
00:48:11,761 --> 00:48:15,197
Attagirl. Come on.
Don't let him get you.

586
00:48:31,014 --> 00:48:33,608
No, I really shouldn't
have any more. I'm driving.

587
00:48:33,717 --> 00:48:35,514
Well, actually, I'm trying to get you to

588
00:48:35,585 --> 00:48:37,485
stay for dinner. A lot
of roast beef left over.

589
00:48:37,587 --> 00:48:42,581
No, I couldn't possibly.
I... have to get back. All right.

590
00:48:42,692 --> 00:48:44,683
Cheers. Cheers.

591
00:48:46,796 --> 00:48:50,323
Why do you have to rush off?
What's so important in San Francisco?

592
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,836
Well, I have to get to
work tomorrow, for one thing.

593
00:48:53,937 --> 00:48:56,929
You have a job? I have several jobs.

594
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:00,373
What do you do? I do
different things on different days.

595
00:49:00,477 --> 00:49:02,377
Like what?

596
00:49:02,479 --> 00:49:04,037
Well, on Mondays and Wednesdays, I work

597
00:49:04,147 --> 00:49:05,637
for the Travelers' Aid at the airport.

598
00:49:05,749 --> 00:49:07,683
Helping travelers?

599
00:49:07,751 --> 00:49:10,948
No, misdirecting them. I
thought you could read my character.

600
00:49:10,987 --> 00:49:15,083
On Tuesdays, I take a course in
General Semantics at Berkeley...

601
00:49:15,158 --> 00:49:17,285
finding new four-letter words.

602
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:19,954
- That's not a job, of course...
- You mean, you don't have to...

603
00:49:20,063 --> 00:49:22,793
And on Thursdays, I
have my meeting and lunch.

604
00:49:22,899 --> 00:49:24,594
- In the underworld, I suppose

605
00:49:24,701 --> 00:49:26,862
I shall disappoint you.

606
00:49:26,970 --> 00:49:29,962
We're sending a little
Korean boy through school.

607
00:49:30,073 --> 00:49:32,507
We actually raise money for it.

608
00:49:36,379 --> 00:49:38,711
You see, Rome...

609
00:49:38,782 --> 00:49:42,309
That entire summer, I did nothing but...

610
00:49:42,385 --> 00:49:45,218
Well, it was very
easy to get lost there.

611
00:49:45,322 --> 00:49:48,985
So when I came back, I
thought it was time I began...

612
00:49:49,025 --> 00:49:51,323
I don't know... finding something again.

613
00:49:55,231 --> 00:49:58,428
So, on Mondays and
Thursdays, I keep myself busy.

614
00:49:59,736 --> 00:50:02,432
- What about Fridays?
- Fridays? They're free.

615
00:50:05,108 --> 00:50:08,908
I sometimes go to bird shops on Fridays.

616
00:50:08,945 --> 00:50:11,937
I'm very glad you do.

617
00:50:12,015 --> 00:50:14,040
A nice, innocent, little day.

618
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:16,618
Oh, yes.

619
00:50:19,122 --> 00:50:22,023
I have an Aunt Tessa.
Have you got an Aunt Tessa?

620
00:50:22,125 --> 00:50:23,615
- Mm-mm

621
00:50:23,727 --> 00:50:26,628
Mine is very prim and straight-laced.

622
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:29,631
I'm giving her a mynah bird
when she comes back from Europe.

623
00:50:29,733 --> 00:50:33,669
Mynah birds talk, you know.
Can you see my Aunt Tessa's face...

624
00:50:33,770 --> 00:50:38,366
when this one tells us one or two of
the words I've picked up at Berkeley?

625
00:50:38,441 --> 00:50:41,035
You need a mother's care, my child.

626
00:50:43,179 --> 00:50:46,740
- Not my mother's.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

627
00:50:48,351 --> 00:50:51,445
What have you got to be sorry about?

628
00:50:51,488 --> 00:50:54,116
My mother? Don't waste your time.

629
00:50:54,190 --> 00:50:57,887
She ditched us when I was 11 and
ran off with some hotel man in the East.

630
00:50:57,994 --> 00:51:01,020
You know what a mother's love is?

631
00:51:03,033 --> 00:51:06,628
- Yes, I do.
- You mean it's better to be ditched?

632
00:51:08,405 --> 00:51:13,240
No. I think it's better to be
loved. Don't you ever see her?

633
00:51:18,948 --> 00:51:22,145
I don't know where she is.

634
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:27,815
Well, maybe I ought to
go join the other children.

635
00:51:33,963 --> 00:51:36,727
All right. Here we go. One...

636
00:51:38,134 --> 00:51:40,762
two...

637
00:51:40,837 --> 00:51:43,328
three.

638
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,465
There you go.

639
00:51:54,317 --> 00:51:57,081
Look! Look!

640
00:51:57,187 --> 00:51:59,712
Hey! No touching allowed!

641
00:52:01,424 --> 00:52:04,188
Oh!

642
00:52:29,519 --> 00:52:32,818
Help me get the children into the house.

643
00:53:07,023 --> 00:53:08,991
There you go.

644
00:53:12,796 --> 00:53:16,197
Have they gone, Mitch?

645
00:53:16,232 --> 00:53:18,598
I think so. Is anyone hurt?

646
00:53:18,701 --> 00:53:21,431
Jenny got a scratch down
her cheek, but it's nothing.

647
00:53:21,504 --> 00:53:23,938
That makes three times.

648
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:30,001
Mitch, this isn't usual, is it?

649
00:53:30,046 --> 00:53:31,911
The gull when I was in the boat

650
00:53:32,015 --> 00:53:33,710
yesterday, the one
at Annie's last night...

651
00:53:33,817 --> 00:53:35,717
Last night? What do you mean?

652
00:53:35,819 --> 00:53:40,222
A gull smashed into Annie's
front door. Mitch, what's happening?

653
00:53:40,256 --> 00:53:43,453
L... I don't know. Do you
have to go back to Annie's?

654
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:45,460
No. I have my things in the car.

655
00:53:45,562 --> 00:53:49,828
Stay and have something to eat before
you start back. I'd feel a lot better.

656
00:53:59,876 --> 00:54:03,073
Would you like some
mustard with that? No, thank you.

657
00:54:03,112 --> 00:54:05,205
Why didn't Annie
stay? Said something about

658
00:54:05,315 --> 00:54:07,374
going home to take a
call from her sister.

659
00:54:07,483 --> 00:54:09,474
What's the matter with them?

660
00:54:09,586 --> 00:54:12,783
What's the matter with all the
birds? Where did you want this coffee?

661
00:54:12,889 --> 00:54:15,983
Here on the table, honey.
Hurry up with yours, Mitch.

662
00:54:16,025 --> 00:54:18,789
I'm sure Miss Daniels
wants to be on her way.

663
00:54:18,828 --> 00:54:21,228
I think you ought to
stay the night, Melanie.

664
00:54:21,331 --> 00:54:24,323
We have an extra room
upstairs and everything.

665
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,925
That road can be a
pretty bad one at night.

666
00:54:27,003 --> 00:54:28,834
If I go across to Santa Rosa, I'll come

667
00:54:28,938 --> 00:54:30,633
out on the freeway
much earlier, won't I?

668
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:32,708
Yes, and the freeway is much quicker.

669
00:54:32,742 --> 00:54:36,109
But she'll be hitting all the heavy
traffic going back to San Francisco.

670
00:54:36,145 --> 00:54:39,637
Just listen to those lovebirds.

671
00:54:41,751 --> 00:54:44,117
Mitch.

672
00:54:54,264 --> 00:54:57,199
Cover your faces! Cover your eyes!

673
00:56:16,312 --> 00:56:18,473
That's a sparrow, all right.

674
00:56:18,514 --> 00:56:22,109
We know what it is, Al. Did you
have a light burnin' or somethin'?

675
00:56:22,185 --> 00:56:25,552
Yes, but there wouldn't have been
that much light going up the chimney.

676
00:56:25,588 --> 00:56:29,183
Sometimes birds are attracted
by light. Sure is a peculiar thing.

677
00:56:29,292 --> 00:56:31,886
All right, but we've got
to do something about it!

678
00:56:31,995 --> 00:56:35,192
I don't think I get
you, Mitch. Do about what?

679
00:56:35,298 --> 00:56:38,631
Well, the birds invaded the house.

680
00:56:38,701 --> 00:56:41,636
What's more likely... they
got in the room and just panicked.

681
00:56:41,704 --> 00:56:43,831
I'll admit a bird will
panic in an enclosed room,

682
00:56:43,906 --> 00:56:47,808
but they didn't just get in: :
They came in, right down the chimney.

683
00:56:47,844 --> 00:56:49,903
My wife found a bird in the back seat of

684
00:56:50,013 --> 00:56:52,004
her car once. Tell him about the party.

685
00:56:52,048 --> 00:56:54,778
We had a party here this
afternoon for Cathy, for her birthday.

686
00:56:54,884 --> 00:56:57,478
How old is she? Eleven!
In the middle of the party,

687
00:56:57,553 --> 00:57:00,147
some seagulls came down at the children!

688
00:57:00,189 --> 00:57:02,680
Miss Daniels was
attacked by a gull yesterday.

689
00:57:02,759 --> 00:57:06,195
Yeah. Were the kids
bothering the birds or something?

690
00:57:06,295 --> 00:57:07,853
If you make any kind of a

691
00:57:07,964 --> 00:57:09,761
disturbance near them,
they'll come after you.

692
00:57:09,866 --> 00:57:13,996
Al, the children were
playing a game. Those gulls attacked.

693
00:57:14,103 --> 00:57:17,561
Now, Lydia, "attack" is a
pretty strong word, don't you think?

694
00:57:17,607 --> 00:57:21,873
I mean, birds just don't go around
attacking people without no reason.

695
00:57:21,978 --> 00:57:24,776
The kids probably
scared 'em, that's all.

696
00:57:24,881 --> 00:57:27,611
These birds attacked.

697
00:57:27,717 --> 00:57:31,414
You got quite a mess
here, I'll admit that.

698
00:57:31,521 --> 00:57:34,183
Maybe you ought to put some
screen on top of your chimney.

699
00:57:34,223 --> 00:57:36,487
You want help cleaning
up? No. I can handle it.

700
00:57:36,592 --> 00:57:38,685
It shouldn't be too much of a job.

701
00:57:41,230 --> 00:57:44,495
I'll take Cathy up to bed.

702
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:47,000
I think I should stay, don't you?

703
00:57:47,036 --> 00:57:50,301
It would be nice if you could.

704
00:57:50,406 --> 00:57:53,034
My things are in the car. Do
you want to go with me? All right.

705
00:57:53,142 --> 00:57:55,440
Well, anything else I
can do, Mitch? No thanks, Al.

706
00:57:55,478 --> 00:57:58,072
We'll be all right. Good night, Lydia.

707
00:57:58,147 --> 00:58:00,741
Sure is peculiar.

708
00:58:11,394 --> 00:58:15,558
Mitch. Mitch. Mitch!

709
00:58:15,598 --> 00:58:18,897
Yes, Mother? I'm
going to drop Cathy off now.

710
00:58:18,968 --> 00:58:21,801
I'll probably drive
over to the Fawcett farm.

711
00:58:21,871 --> 00:58:24,169
Okay.

712
00:59:02,805 --> 00:59:04,898
Mornin'.

713
00:59:06,842 --> 00:59:09,310
Good morning, George.
Is Mr. Fawcett around?

714
00:59:09,412 --> 00:59:11,505
I think so, ma'am. Ain't seen him this

715
00:59:11,614 --> 00:59:13,605
morning, but he ought to be in there.

716
00:59:15,117 --> 00:59:17,017
Thanks.

717
00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:40,672
Dan, are you home?

718
01:00:42,904 --> 01:00:44,804
Uh...

719
01:00:48,543 --> 01:00:51,307
Uh...

720
01:01:30,185 --> 01:01:32,449
Mother!

721
01:01:32,537 --> 01:01:36,029
What is it, dear? What's the matter?

722
01:01:37,592 --> 01:01:40,425
Oh!

723
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,935
Al Malone, the deputy, just called.
He wants me over at the Fawcett place.

724
01:01:49,003 --> 01:01:51,096
Some detectives from
Santa Rosa will be there.

725
01:01:51,206 --> 01:01:54,835
Will it be all right? Yes. I was
just taking your mother in some tea.

726
01:01:57,045 --> 01:01:59,741
Oh, be careful, please.

727
01:02:09,591 --> 01:02:11,559
And you be careful?

728
01:02:43,892 --> 01:02:47,828
Mitch?

729
01:02:47,929 --> 01:02:50,193
No, it's me, Mrs. Brenner.

730
01:02:50,231 --> 01:02:54,634
I thought you might
like some tea. Oh. Thank you.

731
01:02:56,471 --> 01:03:00,032
Where's Mitch? Al Malone
wanted him out at the Fawcett farm.

732
01:03:00,141 --> 01:03:03,042
Why? Didn't Al believe my story?

733
01:03:03,144 --> 01:03:05,908
He was calling from the farm.

734
01:03:05,947 --> 01:03:08,745
Then he saw. Oh, he must have.

735
01:03:08,783 --> 01:03:11,081
They sent for the Santa Rosa police.

736
01:03:11,152 --> 01:03:14,588
What good will they do?

737
01:03:16,691 --> 01:03:18,591
Do you think Cathy's
all right at the school?

738
01:03:20,061 --> 01:03:23,292
Yes, I'm sure she's fine.

739
01:03:23,364 --> 01:03:27,266
Do I sound very foolish to you?

740
01:03:27,302 --> 01:03:29,270
Oh, no.

741
01:03:32,373 --> 01:03:34,671
I keep seeing Dan's face.

742
01:03:34,776 --> 01:03:37,074
And they have such
big windows at the school.

743
01:03:37,178 --> 01:03:39,112
All the windows are
broken in Dan's bedroom.

744
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:43,014
All the windows! Try
not to think about that.

745
01:03:44,385 --> 01:03:47,377
I wish I were a stronger person.

746
01:03:51,793 --> 01:03:54,660
I lost my husband
four years ago, you know.

747
01:03:56,664 --> 01:03:58,427
It's terrible how you... you depend on

748
01:03:58,533 --> 01:04:00,228
someone else for strength, and then...

749
01:04:02,337 --> 01:04:05,465
suddenly all the strength
is gone, and you're alone.

750
01:04:10,979 --> 01:04:14,574
I'd love to be able to relax sometime.

751
01:04:14,682 --> 01:04:17,344
I'd love to be able to sleep.

752
01:04:19,854 --> 01:04:23,290
- Do you think Cathy's all right?
- Annie's there.

753
01:04:23,358 --> 01:04:26,088
She'll be all right.

754
01:04:27,762 --> 01:04:31,095
I'm not like this, you know? N
- Not usually.

755
01:04:31,165 --> 01:04:33,963
I don't fuss and fret about my children.

756
01:04:38,306 --> 01:04:41,070
When Frank died...

757
01:04:42,610 --> 01:04:46,706
You see, he understood the
children. He really understood them.

758
01:04:46,781 --> 01:04:50,410
He had the knack of entering into
their world, of becoming part of them.

759
01:04:50,518 --> 01:04:53,919
That's a very rare talent. Yes.

760
01:04:55,556 --> 01:04:59,356
Oh, I wish, I wish... I
wish I could be like that.

761
01:05:03,464 --> 01:05:05,432
I miss him.

762
01:05:07,535 --> 01:05:10,629
Sometimes, even now, I wake
up in the morning and I think,

763
01:05:10,672 --> 01:05:14,938
"I must get Frank's breakfast."

764
01:05:14,976 --> 01:05:18,673
And I get up, and there's a very
good reason for getting out of bed,

765
01:05:18,746 --> 01:05:20,839
until of course...

766
01:05:20,948 --> 01:05:22,848
I remember.

767
01:05:28,389 --> 01:05:31,256
I miss talking to him.

768
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:35,256
Cathy's a child, of course, and Mitch...

769
01:05:37,198 --> 01:05:40,793
Well, Mitch has his own life.

770
01:05:40,902 --> 01:05:43,962
I'm glad he stayed here today.

771
01:05:44,005 --> 01:05:46,769
I- I feel safer with him here.

772
01:05:48,509 --> 01:05:51,342
Would you like to rest now? No.

773
01:05:51,379 --> 01:05:53,677
No, don't go.

774
01:05:55,516 --> 01:05:57,916
I feel as if I don't
understand you at all, and I...

775
01:05:57,952 --> 01:06:00,113
I want so much to understand.

776
01:06:00,221 --> 01:06:03,122
Why, Mrs. Brenner?

777
01:06:04,926 --> 01:06:08,726
Because my son seems
to be very fond of you.

778
01:06:08,830 --> 01:06:10,957
And I don't quite
know how I feel about it.

779
01:06:14,936 --> 01:06:16,870
I don't even know if I like you or not.

780
01:06:19,741 --> 01:06:22,539
Is that so important, your liking me?

781
01:06:22,643 --> 01:06:24,543
Well, yes. I think so.

782
01:06:24,645 --> 01:06:28,376
Mitch is important to me.

783
01:06:28,483 --> 01:06:31,043
I want to like whatever girl he chooses.

784
01:06:32,987 --> 01:06:36,150
And perhaps if you don't?

785
01:06:36,190 --> 01:06:40,354
Well, then I don't think
it'll matter much to anyone but me.

786
01:06:40,394 --> 01:06:42,988
Oh, I think it would
also matter to Mitch.

787
01:06:44,565 --> 01:06:47,557
Mitch has always done
exactly what he wanted to do.

788
01:06:52,507 --> 01:06:58,104
But, you see, I-I
don't want to be left alone.

789
01:06:58,212 --> 01:07:01,045
I don't think I could
bear to be left alone!

790
01:07:01,115 --> 01:07:06,109
Oh, forgive me.

791
01:07:06,154 --> 01:07:08,748
This business with the
birds has upset me, I...

792
01:07:08,856 --> 01:07:12,257
I don't know what I'd
do if Mitch weren't here.

793
01:07:12,326 --> 01:07:15,557
Why don't you try to
sleep now, Mrs. Brenner?

794
01:07:16,931 --> 01:07:19,229
I wish I was stronger.

795
01:07:20,835 --> 01:07:24,737
Do you think she's all right?

796
01:07:24,839 --> 01:07:26,739
Do you think she's
all right at the school?

797
01:07:28,342 --> 01:07:32,779
- Would you like me to go for her?
- Oh, I-I couldn't ask it.

798
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:37,283
- Oh, I don't mind, really.
- Would you?

799
01:07:37,351 --> 01:07:40,878
- I'd feel so much better.
- I'll go right now.

800
01:07:50,865 --> 01:07:53,891
Melanie?

801
01:07:55,002 --> 01:07:56,902
Thanks for the tea.

please put your song books away,

01:11:44,799 --> 01:11:46,733
then stand up alongside your desks.

863
01:11:46,801 --> 01:11:50,032
We'll go out for recess as
soon as everybody gets ready.

864
01:11:51,305 --> 01:11:53,739
We are not going into the playground...

865
01:11:53,774 --> 01:11:56,265
until everybody has quieted down.

866
01:12:02,249 --> 01:12:05,343
Close that door. Quickly. Please. What?

867
01:12:08,556 --> 01:12:11,252
What is it? Look.

868
01:12:14,195 --> 01:12:16,390
We've got to get the
children out of here.

869
01:12:21,702 --> 01:12:24,193
Shh, shh, shh! All
right, children. Now, quiet.

870
01:12:24,305 --> 01:12:27,274
Quiet. Miss Daniels would like to see...

871
01:12:27,374 --> 01:12:29,467
how we conduct
ourselves during a fire drill.

872
01:12:32,146 --> 01:12:35,513
I would like you to show her
how quiet and obedient you can be.

873
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:38,211
Oh, uh, we're going out of school now.

874
01:12:38,319 --> 01:12:39,809
- Leave school

875
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:42,184
We want those of you who
live nearby to go directly home.

876
01:12:42,289 --> 01:12:44,189
Home?

877
01:12:44,291 --> 01:12:45,781
I want the rest of you to go down the

878
01:12:45,893 --> 01:12:47,690
hill all the way to
the hotel. Is that clear?

879
01:12:47,795 --> 01:12:49,786
Yes, Miss Hayworth.

880
01:12:49,830 --> 01:12:52,128
Melanie?

881
01:12:53,300 --> 01:12:55,734
I want you to go as quietly as possible.

882
01:12:55,769 --> 01:12:59,330
Do not make a sound
until I tell you to run.

883
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:02,170
Then run as quickly as you
can. Now, does everybody understand?

884
01:13:02,276 --> 01:13:04,176
Yes, Miss Hayworth.

885
01:13:04,278 --> 01:13:06,371
All right, John, you lead the way.

886
01:14:41,508 --> 01:14:46,002
Cathy! Cathy!

887
01:15:42,369 --> 01:15:45,167
Well, Daddy, there
were hundreds of them.

888
01:15:45,272 --> 01:15:49,470
No, I'm not hysterical. I'm trying to
tell you this as calmly as I know how.

889
01:15:51,178 --> 01:15:53,703
All right, Daddy. Yes, Daddy.

890
01:15:53,747 --> 01:15:56,910
Well, just now. Not 15 minutes ago.

891
01:15:58,519 --> 01:16:00,749
At the school.

892
01:16:00,854 --> 01:16:03,516
No, I don't. Just a minute.
What's the name of the school?

893
01:16:03,557 --> 01:16:07,357
- Just the Bodega Bay School.
- The Bodega Bay School.

894
01:16:09,029 --> 01:16:12,465
Well, I don't know how
many children... 30 or 40.

895
01:16:14,134 --> 01:16:17,262
No, the birds didn't attack until
the children were outside the school.

896
01:16:17,338 --> 01:16:19,829
Help you, Mrs. Bundy? I
need some change, Mr. Carter.

897
01:16:19,873 --> 01:16:22,433
Crows, I think.

898
01:16:22,543 --> 01:16:25,979
Well, I don't know, Daddy. Is there a
difference between crows and blackbirds?

899
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:29,743
There is very definitely a
difference, Miss. Thank you.

900
01:16:29,783 --> 01:16:32,377
They're different, Daddy.

901
01:16:33,854 --> 01:16:36,186
Well, I think these were crows.

902
01:16:36,290 --> 01:16:38,588
Well, yes. Hundreds of them.

903
01:16:38,659 --> 01:16:41,150
Yes, they attacked the
children. Attacked them!

904
01:16:41,261 --> 01:16:43,752
Well, I don't know when,

905
01:16:43,864 --> 01:16:47,163
but I simply can't leave now, Daddy.

906
01:16:47,267 --> 01:16:49,497
All right. Yes. Good-bye.

907
01:16:49,570 --> 01:16:53,301
They're both perching birds, of
course. But quite different species.

908
01:16:53,374 --> 01:16:55,842
The crow is Corvus brachyrhynchos,

909
01:16:55,909 --> 01:16:59,310
and the blackbird is
Euphagus cyanocephalos.

910
01:16:59,413 --> 01:17:01,313
Thank you.

911
01:17:01,415 --> 01:17:04,509
You have the number at the Fawcett
farm? Right here in this book, miss.

912
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:08,613
I can't see that it makes
any difference, Mrs. Bundy.

913
01:17:08,722 --> 01:17:12,317
Crows or blackbirds, if the school
was attacked, that's pretty serious.

914
01:17:12,426 --> 01:17:14,326
I hardly think that either species...

915
01:17:14,428 --> 01:17:17,556
would have sufficient
intelligence to launch a massed attack.

916
01:17:17,664 --> 01:17:20,132
Their brainpans are not big enough to...

917
01:17:20,167 --> 01:17:22,260
I just came from the
school, madam. I don't

918
01:17:22,336 --> 01:17:24,361
know anything about
their brainpans, but...

919
01:17:24,471 --> 01:17:27,963
Well, I do. I do know.

920
01:17:28,075 --> 01:17:30,669
Ornithology happens to be my avocation.

921
01:17:30,744 --> 01:17:33,941
Birds are not
aggressive creatures, miss.

922
01:17:33,981 --> 01:17:36,973
They bring beauty into the
world. It is mankind, rather, who...

923
01:17:37,084 --> 01:17:39,143
Sam! Three southern fried chicken.

924
01:17:39,186 --> 01:17:41,154
Baked potato on all of them.

925
01:17:41,255 --> 01:17:43,746
Yes, may I speak to
Mitch Brenner, please?

926
01:17:43,791 --> 01:17:48,160
Yes, I'll wait. It is
mankind, rather, who insists upon...

927
01:17:48,262 --> 01:17:50,890
making it difficult for
life to exist upon this planet.

928
01:17:50,964 --> 01:17:52,556
Now, if it were not for birds... Mrs.

929
01:17:52,666 --> 01:17:54,099
Bundy, you don't seem to understand.

930
01:17:54,201 --> 01:17:57,534
This young lady said there
was an attack on the school.

931
01:17:57,638 --> 01:17:59,538
Impossible! Oh, Mitch?

932
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:01,505
Oh, I'm glad I caught you. Something

933
01:18:01,542 --> 01:18:03,339
terrible has ha...
It's the end of the world!

934
01:18:03,444 --> 01:18:05,844
Two Bloody Marys, Deke.

935
01:18:05,913 --> 01:18:08,143
What actually happened at
the school? Bunch of crows...

936
01:18:08,248 --> 01:18:10,148
attacked the school kids.

937
01:18:10,250 --> 01:18:13,708
It's the end of the world.
"Thus saith the Lord God...

938
01:18:13,821 --> 01:18:17,348
"unto the mountains and the
hills, and the rivers and the valleys.

939
01:18:17,458 --> 01:18:20,120
"Behold I, even I...

940
01:18:20,160 --> 01:18:22,128
"shall bring a sword upon you.

941
01:18:22,229 --> 01:18:25,130
And I will devastate your high places."

942
01:18:25,165 --> 01:18:27,133
Ezekiel, chapter six.

943
01:18:27,167 --> 01:18:29,135
"Woe unto them that rise up early in the

944
01:18:29,236 --> 01:18:31,136
morning, that they
may follow strong drink."

945
01:18:31,238 --> 01:18:35,140
Isaiah, chapter five.
It's the end of the world.

946
01:18:35,175 --> 01:18:37,143
I hardly think a few birds are going

947
01:18:37,244 --> 01:18:39,144
to bring about the end of the world.

948
01:18:39,246 --> 01:18:42,477
These weren't a few birds. I
didn't know there were many crows...

949
01:18:42,549 --> 01:18:44,483
in Bodega Bay this time of year.

950
01:18:44,551 --> 01:18:48,078
The crow is a permanent
resident throughout its range.

951
01:18:48,155 --> 01:18:51,591
In fact, during our
Christmas count, we recorded...

952
01:18:51,692 --> 01:18:53,887
How many gulls did
you count, Mrs. Bundy?

953
01:18:53,927 --> 01:18:57,090
Which gulls, Mr. Sholes?
There are several varieties.

954
01:18:57,197 --> 01:18:59,495
The ones who've been
playing devil with my fishing boats.

955
01:18:59,533 --> 01:19:02,502
- Have you had trouble with gulls?
- One of my boats did, last week.

956
01:19:02,603 --> 01:19:05,401
This young lady was hit
by a gull only Saturday.

957
01:19:05,506 --> 01:19:08,907
Deke, I'm still waiting for
those Bloody Marys. Comin'right up.

958
01:19:09,009 --> 01:19:11,204
Could you ask them
to lower their voices,

959
01:19:11,311 --> 01:19:13,336
please? They're
frightening the children.

960
01:19:13,447 --> 01:19:16,109
A whole flock of gulls
nearly capsized one of my boats.

961
01:19:16,216 --> 01:19:18,116
Practically tore the skipper's arm off.

962
01:19:18,218 --> 01:19:20,812
You're scaring the
kids. Keep it low. All right.

963
01:19:20,921 --> 01:19:23,719
Yeah, but he's scarin' me, too.

964
01:19:23,757 --> 01:19:26,225
Are you tryin' to say that all these...

965
01:19:27,661 --> 01:19:29,629
Nah, that sounds impossible, Sebastian.

966
01:19:29,663 --> 01:19:32,427
Deke, look, I'm just tellin' you
what happened to one of my boats.

967
01:19:32,533 --> 01:19:35,229
The gulls were after
your fish, Mr. Sholes.

968
01:19:35,269 --> 01:19:37,635
Really, let's be logical about this.

969
01:19:37,738 --> 01:19:39,968
What were the crows after at the school?

970
01:19:41,942 --> 01:19:44,137
What do you think they
were after? Miss, uh...

971
01:19:44,177 --> 01:19:46,975
Daniels. I think they
were after the children.

972
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:51,346
- For what purpose?
- To kill them.

973
01:19:51,385 --> 01:19:55,685
- Why?
- I don't know why.

974
01:19:55,756 --> 01:19:59,157
I thought not. Birds have
been on this planet, Miss Daniels,

975
01:19:59,192 --> 01:20:02,958
Since archeopteryx,
140 million years ago.

976
01:20:02,996 --> 01:20:06,056
Doesn't it seem odd that
they'd wait all that time...

977
01:20:06,166 --> 01:20:08,794
to start a... a war against humanity?

978
01:20:08,902 --> 01:20:11,302
No one called it a war.
Scotch, light on the water.

979
01:20:11,371 --> 01:20:14,272
You and Mr. Sholes
seem to be implying as much.

980
01:20:14,308 --> 01:20:17,106
Who said anything about a
war? All I said, some gulls...

981
01:20:17,177 --> 01:20:19,111
Want some more coffee? No.

982
01:20:19,179 --> 01:20:21,113
...came down on one of my boats.

983
01:20:21,181 --> 01:20:23,376
They could have been after
the fish, just like you said.

984
01:20:23,417 --> 01:20:26,215
- The Captain should have shot at them.
- Huh?

985
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:29,778
Gulls are scavengers,
anyway. Most birds are.

986
01:20:29,890 --> 01:20:32,415
Get yourselves guns and wipe
them off the face of the Earth!

987
01:20:32,526 --> 01:20:36,519
That would hardly be possible.
- Why not, Mrs. Bundy?

988
01:20:36,597 --> 01:20:39,998
Because there are 8,650 species...

989
01:20:40,100 --> 01:20:42,796
of birds in the world today, Mr. Carter.

990
01:20:42,903 --> 01:20:46,737
It is estimated that
5,750,000,000 birds...

991
01:20:46,807 --> 01:20:48,741
live in the United States alone.

992
01:20:48,809 --> 01:20:50,743
The five continents of the world...

993
01:20:50,811 --> 01:20:53,609
Kill 'em all. Get
rid of the messy animals.

994
01:20:53,647 --> 01:20:56,741
...probably contain
more than 100 billion birds.

995
01:20:56,783 --> 01:20:58,307
It's the end of the world.

996
01:20:58,352 --> 01:21:00,547
- Those gulls must
have been after the fish

997
01:21:00,587 --> 01:21:03,488
Of course! Hurry up,
children. Finish your lunch.

998
01:21:03,557 --> 01:21:06,253
Are the birds gonna eat us, Mommy?

999
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:09,090
Hell, maybe we're all getting
a little carried away by this.

1000
01:21:09,162 --> 01:21:10,857
Admittedly, a few birds did act strange,

1001
01:21:10,964 --> 01:21:12,556
but that's no reason to believe that...

1002
01:21:12,599 --> 01:21:16,763
I keep telling you, this isn't a few
birds. These are gulls, crows, swifts...

1003
01:21:16,870 --> 01:21:20,067
I have never known birds of
different species to flock together.

1004
01:21:20,173 --> 01:21:22,664
The very concept is unimaginable.

1005
01:21:22,776 --> 01:21:25,973
Why, if that happened,
we wouldn't have a chance!

1006
01:21:26,079 --> 01:21:28,309
How could we
possibly hope to fight them?

1007
01:21:28,382 --> 01:21:31,476
We couldn't, you're
right. You're right, Mrs. Bundy.

1008
01:21:31,585 --> 01:21:33,416
What's the matter?
Somethin' wrong out here?

1009
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:35,010
- We're fighting a war, Sam

1010
01:21:35,122 --> 01:21:37,386
A war? Against who?

1011
01:21:37,424 --> 01:21:38,982
Against birds!

1012
01:21:39,026 --> 01:21:41,517
- I'm glad you all
think this is so amusing

1013
01:21:41,595 --> 01:21:44,792
You've frightened the children half out
of their wits. If the young lady said...

1014
01:21:44,898 --> 01:21:47,833
she saw the attack at a
school, why don't you believe her?

1015
01:21:47,934 --> 01:21:50,835
What attack? Who attacked
the school? Birds did. Crows.

1016
01:21:50,937 --> 01:21:53,303
You're all sitting around here debating!

1017
01:21:53,407 --> 01:21:55,739
What do you want them to do
next? Crash through that window?

1018
01:21:55,776 --> 01:21:59,872
Mommy! Ssh. Put on your coat.

1019
01:22:00,347 --> 01:22:03,578
Why don't you all go home,
lock your doors and windows?

1020
01:22:03,684 --> 01:22:05,549
What's the fastest way to San Francisco?

1021
01:22:05,652 --> 01:22:07,142
- The freeway, ma'am

1022
01:22:07,254 --> 01:22:08,744
How do I find it?

1023
01:22:08,855 --> 01:22:11,380
- I'm goin'out that
way, lady. You can follow me

1024
01:22:11,491 --> 01:22:15,450
- Well then, let's leave now.
- Haven't finished my drink yet.

1025
01:22:16,063 --> 01:22:18,463
I got here as fast as
I could. Where's Cathy?

1026
01:22:18,498 --> 01:22:21,399
She's with Annie. She's all right.
Al, why aren't you over at the school,

1027
01:22:21,501 --> 01:22:22,991
Where the attack was?

1028
01:22:23,103 --> 01:22:25,298
- 'Cause I just got
back from Dan Fawcett's place

1029
01:22:25,372 --> 01:22:28,603
- He was killed last night by birds.
- What?

1030
01:22:28,709 --> 01:22:30,700
Hold it, you don't know that for a fact.

1031
01:22:30,777 --> 01:22:32,301
What are the facts?

1032
01:22:32,379 --> 01:22:35,576
- The Santa Rosa Police
think it's a felony murder

1033
01:22:35,615 --> 01:22:37,583
They think a burglar
broke in and killed him.

1034
01:22:37,617 --> 01:22:39,778
How do they explain the
dead birds all over the floor?

1035
01:22:39,886 --> 01:22:43,185
Santa Rosa Police figure they
got in after the old man was killed.

1036
01:22:43,223 --> 01:22:45,783
Were the Santa Rosa
Police at your school today?

1037
01:22:45,826 --> 01:22:48,795
- Are you coming?
- Now take it easy, lady.

1038
01:22:48,829 --> 01:22:51,389
There isn't a bird anywhere in sight!

1039
01:22:51,498 --> 01:22:55,127
"Look at the birds of the
air. They do not sow or reap.

1040
01:22:55,235 --> 01:22:58,932
Yet your Heavenly Father feeds them."

1041
01:22:58,972 --> 01:23:01,770
Something like this
happened in Santa Cruz last year.

1042
01:23:01,875 --> 01:23:04,673
The town was just covered with seagulls.

1043
01:23:04,745 --> 01:23:08,340
- Please finish your drink.
- That's right, sir. I recall it.

1044
01:23:08,381 --> 01:23:10,872
A large flock of
seagulls got lost in a fog,

1045
01:23:10,951 --> 01:23:13,579
and headed into the town
where all the lights were.

1046
01:23:13,687 --> 01:23:16,952
They made some mess, too,
smashing into buildings and everything.

1047
01:23:16,990 --> 01:23:21,484
They always make a mess. The point is
that no one seemed to be upset about it.

1048
01:23:21,561 --> 01:23:24,997
They were all gone next morning, just
as though nothing at all had happened.

1049
01:23:25,098 --> 01:23:28,363
- Poor things.
- I'm leaving! Are you coming?

1050
01:23:28,401 --> 01:23:30,369
All right, all right!

1051
01:23:32,506 --> 01:23:34,872
Well, hope you folks
figure this thing out!

1052
01:23:34,975 --> 01:23:37,773
It's the end of the world!

1053
01:23:37,878 --> 01:23:40,574
I better get back to the
cannery. What do I owe you, Deke?

1054
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:41,634
S- Sebastian, hold it a minute. Huh?

1055
01:23:42,491 --> 01:23:43,987
I- I don't want to be an alarmist,

1056
01:23:44,100 --> 01:23:45,596
but... No one ever said you were

1057
01:23:45,708 --> 01:23:48,450
I think we're in real trouble. I
don't know how this started, or why,

1058
01:23:48,557 --> 01:23:50,830
but I know it's here and
we'd be crazy to ignore it.

1059
01:23:50,871 --> 01:23:53,784
To ignore what? The "bird
war"? Yes, the "bird war. "

1060
01:23:53,887 --> 01:23:55,920
The bird attack,
plague... Call it what you like,

1061
01:23:55,999 --> 01:23:58,307
they're massing out there
someplace, and they'll be back.

1062
01:23:58,412 --> 01:24:01,325
Ridiculous. C- Come here.

1063
01:24:01,430 --> 01:24:02,960
Unless we do something right now,

1064
01:24:03,039 --> 01:24:04,843
unless we get Bodega
Bay on the move, they...

1065
01:24:04,950 --> 01:24:06,892
Look, Mitch.

1066
01:24:06,994 --> 01:24:09,976
Even if... Even if this is
true, even if all the birds...

1067
01:24:10,079 --> 01:24:13,896
Don't you believe it's
true? No, Mitch, frankly I don't.

1068
01:24:13,933 --> 01:24:17,109
There's no reason I... Well,
it's happening. Isn't that a reason?

1069
01:24:17,219 --> 01:24:19,755
I like Bodega Bay as well as
the next man... Fine, then help me.

1070
01:24:19,867 --> 01:24:22,140
You're an important man.
If you help, they all will.

1071
01:24:22,179 --> 01:24:24,383
Help how? What do you want to do?

1072
01:24:24,492 --> 01:24:26,468
Mrs. Bundy said
something about Santa Cruz.

1073
01:24:26,571 --> 01:24:29,381
About seagulls getting lost in a
fog and flying in towards the lights.

1074
01:24:29,419 --> 01:24:31,727
We don't have fog this
time of year! Make our own fog!

1075
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:33,398
How do you figure to do that? We can use

1076
01:24:33,510 --> 01:24:35,040
smoke pots, the way the Army uses them.

1077
01:24:35,152 --> 01:24:38,626
Look!

1078
01:24:38,673 --> 01:24:42,490
They're attacking again.
Melanie, you stay in here. Come on, Al!

1079
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:49,096
Look out!

1080
01:25:18,027 --> 01:25:21,134
Look at the gas. That
man's lighting a cigar!

1081
01:25:22,820 --> 01:25:25,802
Hey, you! Watch out!
Don't drop that match!

1082
01:25:25,837 --> 01:25:29,048
- Get out of there!
- Mister, run!

1083
01:26:21,415 --> 01:26:23,791
Hey!

1084
01:28:33,491 --> 01:28:37,399
Why are they doing this?

1085
01:28:37,491 --> 01:28:39,480
Why are they doing this?

1086
01:28:39,592 --> 01:28:43,788
They said when you got
here, the whole thing started!

1087
01:28:46,631 --> 01:28:50,087
Who are you? What are you?

1088
01:28:50,199 --> 01:28:52,392
Where did you come from?

1089
01:28:53,534 --> 01:28:56,729
I think you're the cause of all this.

1090
01:28:56,837 --> 01:28:59,236
I think you're evil! Evil!

1091
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:03,829
Oh, God!

1092
01:29:08,145 --> 01:29:10,976
I think they're going!

1093
01:29:11,048 --> 01:29:13,037
We can get Cathy at Annie's now.

1094
01:29:46,872 --> 01:29:49,169
The crows again. Shh!

1095
01:29:54,076 --> 01:29:56,065
Come on.

1096
01:30:25,898 --> 01:30:29,889
Oh, no. Stay here. S
- Stay here.

1097
01:30:37,605 --> 01:30:40,902
Cathy! Where's Cathy?

1098
01:31:12,664 --> 01:31:14,961
Mitch, don't!

1099
01:31:42,885 --> 01:31:45,681
Oh, don't leave her there, Mitch.

1100
01:31:55,160 --> 01:31:57,525
Oh!

1101
01:32:48,296 --> 01:32:50,262
Come on.

1102
01:32:51,298 --> 01:32:54,163
Shh.

1103
01:33:21,019 --> 01:33:24,453
Wh-When we got back
from taking Michele home...

1104
01:33:27,123 --> 01:33:29,749
we-we heard the explosion and we went...

1105
01:33:29,825 --> 01:33:32,417
we went outside to see what it was.

1106
01:33:32,526 --> 01:33:37,223
All-All at once the...
the birds were everywhere!

1107
01:33:37,262 --> 01:33:40,626
All at once she pushed me inside...

1108
01:33:40,731 --> 01:33:42,629
and they covered her!

1109
01:33:42,733 --> 01:33:46,428
Annie... She pushed me inside!

1110
01:34:01,913 --> 01:34:03,879
Give me another one, darling.

1111
01:34:10,886 --> 01:34:12,784
How long have they been gathering there?

1112
01:34:12,887 --> 01:34:14,785
Oh, about 15 minutes.

1113
01:34:19,625 --> 01:34:21,591
Seems like a pattern, doesn't it?

1114
01:34:23,394 --> 01:34:26,828
They strike, then disappear,
and then start massing again.

1115
01:34:35,236 --> 01:34:37,703
Doesn't look so very different, does it?

1116
01:34:37,804 --> 01:34:40,032
A little smoke hanging
over the town, otherwise...

1117
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:43,599
You want to try your father again?

1118
01:34:43,708 --> 01:34:46,005
No, I tried a little
while ago. The phone's dead.

1119
01:34:46,042 --> 01:34:48,600
Still got power, haven't we? Yes.

1120
01:34:48,712 --> 01:34:51,611
Mitch, I'm getting
something on the radio.

1121
01:34:51,714 --> 01:34:53,737
Come on.

1122
01:34:58,752 --> 01:35:01,947
I can't get any of the local stations.

1123
01:35:01,988 --> 01:35:03,977
I think this is San Francisco.

1124
01:35:04,055 --> 01:35:07,580
"...and the work of a team
of professionals. " End quote.

1125
01:35:07,658 --> 01:35:10,148
In Bodega Bay early this
morning, a large flock of crows...

1126
01:35:10,194 --> 01:35:13,684
attacked a group of children who were
leaving the school during a fire drill.

1127
01:35:13,762 --> 01:35:17,252
One little girl was seriously injured
and taken to the hospital in Santa Rosa,

1128
01:35:17,365 --> 01:35:19,593
but the majority of
children reached safety.

1129
01:35:19,699 --> 01:35:22,098
We understand there was
another attack on the town,

1130
01:35:22,167 --> 01:35:24,360
but this information is rather sketchy.

1131
01:35:24,470 --> 01:35:26,368
So far, no word has come through...

1132
01:35:26,471 --> 01:35:28,961
to show if there
have been further attacks.

1133
01:35:29,072 --> 01:35:31,562
On the national scene
today, in Washington...

1134
01:35:31,607 --> 01:35:35,166
Well, is that all?

1135
01:35:35,211 --> 01:35:38,303
I'll have to get some more
water. Mustn't let this fire go out.

1136
01:35:38,379 --> 01:35:42,676
Did you get the windows in the
attic, Mitch? Yes, I got 'em all, dear.

1137
01:35:42,715 --> 01:35:44,977
When do you think
they'll come? I don't know.

1138
01:35:45,083 --> 01:35:47,516
If there are bigger birds,
Mitch, they'll get into the house.

1139
01:35:47,585 --> 01:35:50,381
Well, it's just a chance we'll
have to take. Maybe we ought to leave.

1140
01:35:50,421 --> 01:35:52,387
No, not now! Not when
they're massing out there.

1141
01:35:52,489 --> 01:35:54,717
When? W
- We'll just see what happens.

1142
01:35:54,758 --> 01:35:56,315
Where will we go? L

1143
01:35:56,358 --> 01:35:58,723
- I don't know. I think
we're safe here for the time being

1144
01:35:58,760 --> 01:36:01,352
Let's get the wood in now. What
happens when you run out of wood?

1145
01:36:01,462 --> 01:36:04,122
I don't know! We'll break up
the furniture. You don't know!

1146
01:36:04,163 --> 01:36:07,130
You don't know! When will
you know? When we're all dead!

1147
01:36:07,166 --> 01:36:10,725
If only your father were here...

1148
01:36:11,168 --> 01:36:15,364
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mitch.

1149
01:36:17,373 --> 01:36:19,532
Make yourself some coffee, won't you?

1150
01:36:23,144 --> 01:36:25,269
"In assuming the
tasks of the presidency,

1151
01:36:25,345 --> 01:36:28,073
I said that few generations..."

1152
01:36:33,951 --> 01:36:37,112
Where are they
heading? Somewhere inland.

1153
01:36:37,153 --> 01:36:40,348
Santa Rosa? Maybe.

1154
01:36:40,388 --> 01:36:42,354
Come on. Let's get the wood.

1155
01:37:20,316 --> 01:37:23,909
Mitch? Can I bring
the lovebirds in here?

1156
01:37:24,018 --> 01:37:25,507
- No

1157
01:37:25,618 --> 01:37:29,143
But, Mom, they're in a
cage. They're birds, aren't they?

1158
01:37:31,123 --> 01:37:33,613
Let's leave them in
the kitchen, huh, honey?

1159
01:38:21,491 --> 01:38:25,720
Mitch, why are they
doing this, the birds?

1160
01:38:25,794 --> 01:38:29,922
We don't know, honey. Why
are they trying to kill people?

1161
01:38:30,031 --> 01:38:32,088
I wish I could say.

1162
01:39:45,781 --> 01:39:51,114
I- I'm sick, Melanie.

1163
01:39:53,088 --> 01:39:56,486
I want to... I'll go with you.

1164
01:44:31,444 --> 01:44:33,410
They're going.

1165
01:45:45,329 --> 01:45:48,228
Mitch?

1166
01:48:47,053 --> 01:48:49,611
Oh, Mitch!

1167
01:49:06,866 --> 01:49:09,560
Melanie! Melanie!

1168
01:49:55,533 --> 01:49:58,897
Oh, poor thing! Poor thing!

1169
01:49:58,935 --> 01:50:01,232
Listen, get some water,
bandages and antiseptic. Quickly!

1170
01:50:01,303 --> 01:50:03,634
Bandages. It's terrible.

1171
01:50:07,709 --> 01:50:09,698
Cathy, get some brandy.

1172
01:50:20,950 --> 01:50:23,610
No, no, no! No, no, it's all right.

1173
01:50:23,720 --> 01:50:25,709
No, it's all right, it's
all right, it's all right.

1174
01:50:25,821 --> 01:50:28,845
It's all right. It's all right. No.

1175
01:50:28,922 --> 01:50:32,913
No. Shh! Shh!

1176
01:50:56,775 --> 01:50:58,673
Cathy, get the lamp.

1177
01:51:13,386 --> 01:51:15,614
We've got to get her to a hospital.

1178
01:51:15,688 --> 01:51:18,587
We can't, Mitch. There's no
place we can go. There's San Francisco.

1179
01:51:18,623 --> 01:51:21,022
We'd never make it. We have to try.

1180
01:51:21,091 --> 01:51:24,183
We'll go by way of Bay Hill Road.
Then we don't have to go through town.

1181
01:51:24,294 --> 01:51:26,192
We can't stay here. She needs help!

1182
01:51:26,296 --> 01:51:30,993
I'm frightened. Terribly frightened.

1183
01:51:31,098 --> 01:51:34,190
I don't know what's outside there.

1184
01:51:34,302 --> 01:51:37,326
We better get started
before another attack comes.

1185
01:51:37,437 --> 01:51:40,495
We'll take Melanie's car.
That'll be faster than the truck.

1186
01:51:40,605 --> 01:51:42,798
Can you finish the bandaging? I'll try.

1187
01:51:42,906 --> 01:51:44,804
All right.

1188
01:51:51,146 --> 01:51:55,671
Mitch? See if you can get
anything on the car radio.

1189
01:53:54,431 --> 01:53:56,989
The bird attacks have
subsided for the time being.

1190
01:53:57,098 --> 01:53:59,588
Bodega Bay seems to be the
center, though there are reports...

1191
01:53:59,633 --> 01:54:03,533
of minor attacks on
Sebastopol and a few on Santa Rosa.

1192
01:54:03,604 --> 01:54:06,094
Bodega Bay has been
cordoned off by roadblocks.

1193
01:54:06,205 --> 01:54:08,137
Most of the townspeople
have managed to get out,

1194
01:54:08,206 --> 01:54:11,105
but there are still some
isolated pockets of people.

1195
01:54:11,208 --> 01:54:14,606
No decision has been arrived at
yet as to what the next step will be,

1196
01:54:14,644 --> 01:54:17,805
but there's been some discussion as
to whether the military should go in.

1197
01:54:17,913 --> 01:54:21,608
It appears that the bird attacks come
in waves, with long intervals between.

1198
01:54:21,649 --> 01:54:25,310
The reason for this
does not seem clear as yet.

1199
01:56:15,660 --> 01:56:17,683
Did you hear anything on the radio?

1200
01:56:17,762 --> 01:56:20,285
It's-lt's all right. Come on.

1201
01:56:58,656 --> 01:57:01,123
No. No!

1202
01:57:01,159 --> 01:57:03,125
Shh. Shh.

1203
01:57:30,278 --> 01:57:33,676
- Mitch?
- Shh!

1204
01:57:33,747 --> 01:57:35,770
Stay there.

1205
01:57:43,153 --> 01:57:45,484
Can I bring the lovebirds, Mitch?

1206
01:57:45,555 --> 01:57:47,783
They haven't harmed anyone.

1207
01:57:47,891 --> 01:57:50,153
A- All right. Bring them.
