- She won't surface. One of our shells got her.
- Are you sure?

Went down like a rock.

Oh, I caught some
wonderful shots on deck.

40

A little knot of people
around one of the lifeboats.

41
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:51,034
They look slow and heavy and fat
with the life belts on, so lonesome.

42
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:54,560
Then a shell hit the lifeboat.
They all jumped overboard.

43

I got a beautiful shot of the gun crew
firing at the submarine.

But the best of all was in the boat,
here, with Joe.

a shell from the U-boat

00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,422
[ Ritt] Easy there.

148
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:25,992
[ MacKenzie] Give me the baby.

149
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:37,644
Are you all right, Joe?

150
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:40,013
I got my feet wet a little bit.

151
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:43,019
[Panting] She was fightin' me
all the time in the water.

152
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:48,086
She tried to drown the baby
and herself with it.

153
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:59,370
Huh, it's all right,
sister. You're safe.

154
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:02,429
<i>The baby's safe
It's all right. The danger's over.</i>

155
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:06,466
<i>You're safe now.
Nothing to worry about.</i>

156
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:23,383
Best let her have it.
We'll wait till she's asleep.

157
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,131
Here.

158
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,927
Hey. That's right.

159
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:40,175
Her name's Higley. She was
bombed out in Bristol.

160
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:45,375
One of them shell shock cases sent to
America. Her child was born in New York.

161
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:50,512
Said to me on the ship, “I'm going home
to show my husband the baby.“

162
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:53,284
<i>[Connie] Here, darling.
You better put this on.</i>

163
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:56,918
<i>Hey, look. Another customer.</i>

164
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:08,536
<i>- [ Ritt ] Where'd he come from?
- [Connie] Is he a crew member?</i>

165
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:11,473
<i>- [Sparks ] I never saw him before.
- [Joej Not off our boat.</i>

166
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,908
<i>[ Panting ] Danke Schon.</i>

167
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:21,947
[Speaking German]

168
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,815
He's very grateful to us
for having saved his life.

169
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,861
Regrets very much the U-boat
was compelled to sink our ship.

170
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,862
Ask him why they shelled our lifeboats.

171
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:36,491
[Speaking German]

172
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:39,627
- Captain's orders.
- If you ask me, he's the captain himself.

173
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,228
Ask him if he's the captain.

174
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:47,209
[Speaking German]

175
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:51,346
He says he's not a captain or
officer, just a crew member.

176
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:53,383
Well, crew member
or skipper, he's German.

177
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,942
A guy can't help bein' German
if he's born a German, can he?

178
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:58,318
Neither can a snake help being
a rattlesnake if he's born a rattlesnake.

179
00:12:58,377 --> 00:13:00,323
That don't make him a nightingale.
Get him outta here.

180
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:03,952
Don't be silly, darling. He can't very well
get off in the middle of the ocean, can he?

181
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:05,962
- Throw him off.
- Have you gone out of your mind?

182
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:07,964
- Throw the Nazi buzzard overboard!
- That's out of the question!

183
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:11,058
- It's against the law.
- Whose law? We're on our own. We can make our own law!

184
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:14,263
Now, just a minute.
He was acting under orders.

185
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:17,102
Our freighter was an enemy ship.
After all, we're at war!

186
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:20,337
Is that woman at war?
Ls her baby at war?

187
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,437
And listen, how come
you know the lingo so well?

188
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:25,846
How come when I climbed into this
life boat you were the only one in it...

189
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:27,851
dressed up like you knew
you were going some place?

190
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:32,014
I was going some place.
I was going into a lifeboat.

191
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:34,523
What is this?
Are you insinuating?

192
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:38,221
- You seem pretty anxious to stand up for your friend here.
- What do you mean, my friend?

193
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:40,355
Now, children,
let's keep our shirts on.

194
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:43,593
I haven't got a shirt
or a mink coat either.

195
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:47,001
Oh, I get it.

196
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:51,098
A fellow traveller.
I thought the Comintern was dissolved.

197
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:55,407
Now, we're all sort of fellow travellers, in
a mighty small boat, on a mighty big ocean.

198
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:58,880
<i>And the more we quarrel and criticise
and misunderstand each other...</i>

199
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:01,612
<i>the bigger the ocean gets,
and the smaller the boat.</i>

200
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,950
The boat's too small
for me and this German.

201
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:06,683
Me, I'm perfectly willing to abide
by the decision of the majority.

202
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:08,691
That's the American way.

203
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:12,524
If we harm this man, we are guilty
of the same tactics you hate him for.

204
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:15,828
On the other hand, if we treat him
with kindness and consideration...

205
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:18,368
we might be able to convert him
to our way of thinking.

206
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:20,836
That's the, uh...
That's the Christian way.

207
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:25,035
Okay. Now, me, I'm American too.
I was born one in Chicago.

208
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:28,306
But my people are from Czechoslovakia.
Ever hear of that place?

209
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,574
I say let's throw him overboard
and watch him drown.

210
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:33,310
When he goes down, I'll dance a jig
like Hitler did when France went down.

211
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,318
Me, too.

212
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:38,378
Just for the record,
I'm an American, myself.

213
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:40,481
I'm in a kind of a spot.

214
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,720
My name is Schmidt,
but I changed it to Smith.

215
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:46,558
That's what I got against these guys
more than anything else.

216
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:49,964
They make me ashamed of
the name I was born with.

217
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:53,936
I got a lot of relatives in Germany.
For all I know this guy may be one of them.

218
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:55,939
I say throw him to the sharks.

219
00:14:55,995 --> 00:15:01,172
No, Gus. I don't say it wouldn't be a pleasure,
mind you, but we haven't got the right.

220
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,235
<i>[Gus] The right?
What do you mean the right?</i>

221
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:06,909
Well, he's a prisoner of war.
Got to be treated as such.

222
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:09,543
The way it's done is to hang on
to him till we're picked up...

223
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:12,214
then turn him over
to proper authorities.

224
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:16,914
Till such time, we represent
the authorities. That's clear, isn't it?

225
00:15:16,915 --> 00:15:16,949
Till such time, we represent
the authorities. That's clear, isn't it?

226
00:15:17,048 --> 00:15:20,427
<i>- You see what I mean miss?
- I don't understand any of it.</i>

227
00:15:20,485 --> 00:15:23,989
I don't understand people hurting
each other and killing each other.

228
00:15:24,055 --> 00:15:26,001
I just don't understand it.

229
00:15:26,057 --> 00:15:30,301
- Then what are you doing in a uniform?
- I'm doing the only thing I can.

230
00:15:30,361 --> 00:15:33,069
Trying to put them together again
when they get hurt.

231
00:15:33,131 --> 00:15:36,305
As far as the German's concerned, I...
I agree with Stanley.

232
00:15:36,367 --> 00:15:39,974
So do I. I'll talk to the man. Maybe
I can get some information from him.

233
00:15:40,038 --> 00:15:42,814
- Material for your book?
- Incidentally.

234
00:15:42,874 --> 00:15:46,014
- George?
- What do you say, Joe?

235
00:15:46,077 --> 00:15:49,854
- Do I get to vote too?
- Why... Why certainly!

236
00:15:51,316 --> 00:15:53,318
Guess I'd rather
stay out of this.

237
00:15:53,384 --> 00:15:55,990
How about you, sister?

238
00:15:56,988 --> 00:16:00,060
My baby's dead.

239
00:16:25,717 --> 00:16:28,357
Does anyone know the service
for burial at sea?

240
00:16:28,419 --> 00:16:31,889
Well, I, uh... I suppose
any prayer would do.

241
00:16:31,956 --> 00:16:34,402
Let me see, now.

242
00:16:34,459 --> 00:16:38,566
The Lord is my shepherd.
Uh, I shall not want.

243
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:43,908
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures. He, uh... He, uh...

244
00:16:43,968 --> 00:16:48,474
<i>[Joe ] He leadeth me beside
the still waters.</i>

245
00:16:48,539 --> 00:16:52,112
He restoreth my soul.

246
00:16:52,176 --> 00:16:58,149
He leadeth me in the paths
of righteousness, for His name's sake.

247
00:16:58,216 --> 00:17:03,757
Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

248
00:17:03,821 --> 00:17:06,199
I will fear no evil.

249
00:17:06,257 --> 00:17:11,969
For thou art with me. Thy rod
and thy staff, they comfort me.

250
00:17:13,564 --> 00:17:18,206
Surely goodness and mercy
shall follow me all the days of my life.

251
00:17:19,537 --> 00:17:21,915
And I will dwell in
the house of the Lord...

252
00:17:23,107 --> 00:17:25,178
<i>forever.</i>

253
00:17:25,243 --> 00:17:27,280
<i>Amen.</i>

254
00:17:36,254 --> 00:17:39,292
<i>[Kovac] Well, I don't know how much
of this stuff is any use to us.</i>

255
00:17:39,357 --> 00:17:42,702
<i>Isn't much we can do with
these food compartments.</i>

256
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,263
<i>[ Ritt ] Well, at any rate, things
are getting shipshape.</i>

257
00:17:45,329 --> 00:17:47,502
<i>None of the buoyancy tanks
seem to have been smashed.</i>

258
00:17:47,565 --> 00:17:52,036
<i>The water breaker's been taped up, and in the
morning we'll rig up a sail and get going.</i>

259
00:17:52,103 --> 00:17:55,209
<i>And in the meantime, I think
we'd all better try and get some sleep.</i>

260
00:17:55,273 --> 00:17:57,879
<i>Uh, Kovac, don't forget
to wake me for my watch.</i>

261
00:17:57,942 --> 00:18:00,445
<i>[Kovac] We'd better send up
another ﬂare soon.</i>

262
00:18:03,181 --> 00:18:06,162
How do you feel, darling?

263
00:18:06,217 --> 00:18:10,825
Better, thank you. Much better.

264
00:18:10,888 --> 00:18:13,869
- Have I been asleep long?
- Not very.

265
00:18:15,726 --> 00:18:19,196
- What's this?
- Mrs. Porter lent you her coat to help keep you warm.

266
00:18:20,598 --> 00:18:23,477
It's a beautiful coat.

267
00:18:23,534 --> 00:18:27,004
- Is it real mink?
- I hope so.

268
00:18:27,071 --> 00:18:29,608
It's lovely.

269
00:18:29,674 --> 00:18:32,052
I've always admired mink.

270
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:37,184
It's the most ladylike fur
there is, I always said.

271
00:18:37,248 --> 00:18:43,062
So warm and comfortable.

272
00:18:43,121 --> 00:18:46,193
Thank you so much
for letting me wear it.

273
00:18:47,658 --> 00:18:50,138
Where's Johnny?

274
00:18:52,563 --> 00:18:54,509
Where's my baby?

275
00:18:57,001 --> 00:18:58,947
<i>[ Higley ]
What have you done with him?</i>

276
00:19:00,505 --> 00:19:02,542
What did you do with my baby?

277
00:19:02,607 --> 00:19:06,111
Your baby's dead.
Don't you remember?

278
00:19:17,455 --> 00:19:20,265
You killed him, didn't you?

279
00:19:24,195 --> 00:19:27,904
Poor little thing.

280
00:19:27,965 --> 00:19:33,813
<i>The sea, so big and terrible.</i>

281
00:19:35,773 --> 00:19:39,243
Johnny, it's Mum.

282
00:19:40,578 --> 00:19:42,524
Where are you?

283
00:19:43,881 --> 00:19:46,293
Where are you, johnny?

284
00:19:47,451 --> 00:19:49,863
Johnny.

285
00:19:49,921 --> 00:19:52,231
Let me go. Let me go to him.

286
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:54,793
Get a rope, somebody.
We've got to tie her down.

287
00:19:55,893 --> 00:19:57,895
Here you are.

288
00:19:59,163 --> 00:20:02,474
Let me go to him.

289
00:20:02,533 --> 00:20:04,479
[Whispering] Let me go.

290
00:20:06,103 --> 00:20:09,607
[Yawns Audibly]

291
00:20:58,522 --> 00:21:01,935
- Good morning, sir.
- <i>Hmm?</i> Oh!

292
00:21:01,993 --> 00:21:06,464
Good morning, Sparks. Asleep on watch. It's
a fine thing. I oughta be court-martialed.

293
00:21:08,132 --> 00:21:12,512
- I wonder how much we've drifted.
- Not very far with that sea-anchor out.

294
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:16,416
Oh, the sea-anchor, of course.
You know, I had no idea what those things looked like.

295
00:21:16,474 --> 00:21:20,081
I thought they were big, heavy iron things
with a hook to hold us onto the sea bottom.

296
00:21:20,144 --> 00:21:24,115
When you threw that thing out, I thought it was
some sort of a toy parachute or something.

297
00:21:24,181 --> 00:21:26,218
They really keep the boat from drifting?

298
00:21:26,284 --> 00:21:30,061
Last time I was adrift, a sea anchor
held us up 48 hours in a storm.

299
00:21:30,121 --> 00:21:33,193
- You've been torpedoed before?
- That's right, twice.

300
00:21:33,257 --> 00:21:36,602
- How long before you were picked up?
- Last time, it was 43 days.

301
00:21:36,661 --> 00:21:39,232
Forty-three...
That must have been awful!

302
00:21:39,297 --> 00:21:41,937
Yeah. We did
get a bit sunburned.

303
00:21:41,999 --> 00:21:45,913
Then, of course, we had a good sound boat,
plenty of food and water. Everything intact.

304
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:51,079
- Well, haven't we plenty too?
- A good deal of our food's been ruined.

305
00:21:51,142 --> 00:21:54,123
Three out of the four water breakers
have been smashed.

306
00:21:54,178 --> 00:21:57,625
A lot of water leaked out of
the fourth one before it was taped.

307
00:21:57,682 --> 00:22:00,219
What worries me is the compass.

308
00:22:00,284 --> 00:22:03,356
Knocked to pieces.
That's a bit awkward.

309
00:22:04,955 --> 00:22:07,993
And, of course, there's Jerry.

310
00:22:08,059 --> 00:22:10,232
Ah, good morning, Mrs. Porter.

311
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:16,409
[Sighs] What's good about it?

312
00:22:16,467 --> 00:22:18,413
How soon do we get picked up?

313
00:22:18,469 --> 00:22:21,712
Good morning, Connie. We were discussing
that. It seems there's no way of telling.

314
00:22:21,772 --> 00:22:24,378
- Did you sleep well?
- Not a wink.

315
00:22:24,442 --> 00:22:26,388
Not only that, I froze.

316
00:22:26,444 --> 00:22:30,119
Only had my fur coat to keep me... warm.

317
00:22:30,181 --> 00:22:32,127
Where's Miss Higley?

318

<i>I'm terribly sorry</i>

320
00:22:54,972 --> 00:22:57,976
it was pitch black
when I relieved you, Kovac.

321
00:22:58,042 --> 00:22:59,988
I couldn't see a thing.

322
00:23:00,044 --> 00:23:02,490
For all I know, it might have happened
during your watch.

326
00:23:41,585 --> 00:23:44,498
Oh, thanks. Kovac.
How's the sail coming along?

327
00:23:44,555 --> 00:23:46,557
- Coming along.
- Light, sir?

328
00:23:46,624 --> 00:23:51,039
Uh, no, thanks. I think I'll hoard
this heater till we get some place.

329
00:23:51,095 --> 00:23:54,975
Well, folks, I've been taking inventory,
and we're in the black.

330
00:23:55,032 --> 00:23:59,674
A going concern. It's no use
lying around waiting to be picked up.

331
00:23:59,737 --> 00:24:03,549
As we might have to wait as long as,
uh... as 43 days.

332
00:24:03,607 --> 00:24:07,384
So we might as well get organized.
The first order of business is department heads.

333
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:09,721
- Uh, Sparks?
- Yes, Mr. Rittenhouse.

334
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:13,728
- Call me Ritt. We're all in the same boat.
- Yes, sir. Ritt.

335
00:24:13,784 --> 00:24:15,730

<i>- Aye, aye, sir.
- Uh, George?</i>

337
00:24:17,788 --> 00:24:19,267
Call me Joe.

338
00:24:19,323 --> 00:24:21,997
- Is your name Joe?
- Yes, sir.

339
00:24:22,059 --> 00:24:25,506
Very well. Joe it is.
You are head of the commissary.

340
00:24:25,563 --> 00:24:29,272
- Yes, sir.
- Connie, will you keep the ship's log, please?

341
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:32,940
Righto, Ritto, providing I control
the copyright and all publication rights.

342
00:24:33,003 --> 00:24:34,949
Including the Scandinavian.

343
00:24:35,005 --> 00:24:37,110
[Chuckles] Yes. Miss MacKenzie.

344
00:24:37,174 --> 00:24:40,348
<i>You are in charge of sick bay.</i>

345
00:24:40,411 --> 00:24:43,824
Don't look now, but
I think we have a skipper.

346
00:24:43,881 --> 00:24:47,658
- Who elected Mr. Rittenhouse?
- Mr. Rittenhouse.

347
00:24:47,718 --> 00:24:50,665
- Ritt, to you.
- You think he's capable?

348
00:24:50,721 --> 00:24:53,031
Sure. Till the sail goes up.

349
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:55,036
We never should've
let him stay on board.

350
00:24:55,092 --> 00:24:57,698
He'll eat our food, drink our water,
and double-cross us, first chance he gets.

351
00:24:57,761 --> 00:24:59,741
What are you afraid of?
He's one against seven.

352
00:24:59,797 --> 00:25:02,607
It was eight yesterday.
Or have you forgotten?

353
00:25:03,667 --> 00:25:05,613
There's a piece in here...

354
00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:08,275
about some people who were adrift
in a lifeboat for 80 days.

355
00:25:08,339 --> 00:25:10,285
Say, maybe
we can beat that record.

356
00:25:10,341 --> 00:25:11,752
Heaven forbid.

357
00:25:11,809 --> 00:25:14,085
We might even get in the newsreels.

358
00:25:14,144 --> 00:25:16,090
Rosie'd get a bang outta that.

359
00:25:16,146 --> 00:25:19,127
It'd remind her of the first cup we won
at the Garden for marathon dancing.

360
00:25:19,183 --> 00:25:21,823
- We danced 80 consecutive hours.
- [Stanley] Consecutive?

361
00:25:21,886 --> 00:25:25,060
Well, 10 minutes off every four hours
for coffee, cake, stuff like that.

362
00:25:25,122 --> 00:25:27,124
So how'd you feel
after 80 hours of dancing?

363
00:25:27,191 --> 00:25:30,035
I had a slight headache,
but Rosie, she was just gettin' wound up.

364
00:25:30,094 --> 00:25:32,301
She grabbed a cab,
went right over to Roseland.

365
00:25:32,363 --> 00:25:34,866
- Does she work there?
- She lives there.

366
00:25:37,368 --> 00:25:40,781
- How does the leg feel now?
- It don't feel at all.

367
00:25:40,838 --> 00:25:45,116
I wish I could walk around. I sure hope
that thing don't leave me gimpy.

368
00:25:45,175 --> 00:25:47,121
- Al'd love that.
- Who's Al?

369
00:25:47,177 --> 00:25:50,784
Al Magaroulian.
He's an Armenian rug-cutter.

370
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:54,295
He knew Rosie before I did.
He's got fallen arches.

371
00:25:54,351 --> 00:25:56,422
Keeps him outta the draft,
but not outta Roseland.

372
00:25:56,487 --> 00:26:00,367
Kovac, you know something
about machinery, don't you?

373
00:26:00,424 --> 00:26:02,563
- A little.
- See if you can fix this clasp.

374
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:09,711
Mrs. Porter, I've read a lot of your stuff.
You wanna know what's the matter with it?

375
00:26:09,767 --> 00:26:11,974
No, do tell me.

376
00:26:12,036 --> 00:26:14,949
You've been all over the world.
You've met all kinds of people.

377
00:26:15,005 --> 00:26:18,043
But you never write about them,
you only write about yourself.

378
00:26:18,108 --> 00:26:22,113
You think this whole war's a show put on
for you to cover, like a Broadway play.

379
00:26:22,179 --> 00:26:26,958
And if enough people die before the last
act, maybe you might give it four stars.

380
00:26:27,017 --> 00:26:29,861
- Come on, Sparks.
- All right, Tovarich. Now, listen to me.

381
00:26:30,487 --> 00:26:33,491
<i>[Sparks] Heads up! Joe, man the tiller
till we 're squared a way!</i>

382
00:26:33,557 --> 00:26:36,868
<i>[ Wind Howling]</i>

383
00:26:38,963 --> 00:26:41,671
Well, folks, we're under way.

384
00:26:41,732 --> 00:26:45,179
- Where to?
- Huh?

385
00:26:45,235 --> 00:26:48,808
- Where are we going?
- First operator said we were headed for Bermuda.

386
00:26:48,872 --> 00:26:51,216
Well, good. Uh, Sparks,
you better take the tiller.

387
00:26:51,275 --> 00:26:55,314
Yes, sir. Uh, what about the course?

388
00:26:55,379 --> 00:26:57,859
<i>[ Ritt ] Does anybody here know
the course to Bermuda?</i>

389
00:26:57,915 --> 00:27:01,886
I was at the wheel when we got punctured.
The course was 115 east-south-east.

390
00:27:01,952 --> 00:27:03,898
Fine, then,
east-south-east it is.

391
00:27:03,954 --> 00:27:08,699
Yes, sir. But, uh,
what is east-south-east?

392
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:11,672
<i>- Without a compass...
- What? The matter with the sun?</i>

393
00:27:11,729 --> 00:27:14,869
With the sun this high, it's pretty hard
to tell the points of the compass.

394
00:27:14,932 --> 00:27:16,878
I think it's out that way.

395
00:27:16,934 --> 00:27:19,938
- You think?
- Doesn't anybody <i>know?</i>

[Speaks German]

398
00:27:27,678 --> 00:27:29,624
He says east-south-east
is that direction.

399
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,626
<i>- [Kovac] How's he know?
- Well, he ought to know.</i>

400
00:27:31,682 --> 00:27:33,923
His U-boat was operating
around here, wasn't it?

401
00:27:33,984 --> 00:27:36,191
Do you suppose he'd lead us
to Bermuda, British territory?

402
00:27:36,253 --> 00:27:40,360
[Speaking German]

[Speaking German]

404
00:27:44,928 --> 00:27:47,875
He says he'd rather be a prisoner of war
in Bermuda than here.

405
00:27:47,931 --> 00:27:49,877
At least he'd have
good food and a bed.

406
00:27:49,933 --> 00:27:51,708
I wouldn't trust anything he says.

407
00:27:51,769 --> 00:27:53,715
Kovac, you're so prejudiced
you can't think straight.

408
00:27:53,771 --> 00:27:57,742
If anybody's in the position to know where
we are and where Bermuda is, he's the one.

409
00:27:57,808 --> 00:28:00,379
- Who says so?
- We'll follow the German's course.

410
00:28:00,444 --> 00:28:01,821
Who elected you skipper?

411
00:28:04,248 --> 00:28:08,128
Well, I... Course, if there's anybody
else you'd prefer...

412
00:28:08,185 --> 00:28:10,495
What do you know about a ship?

413
00:28:10,554 --> 00:28:12,500
He just happens to own
a shipyard, that's all.

414
00:28:12,556 --> 00:28:15,002
<i>- [Kovac] Has he ever been in it?
- He has thousands of employees.</i>

415
00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:17,005
Of course he knows
how to handle men.

416
00:28:17,061 --> 00:28:19,632
Not in a lifeboat. What we need is
an able seaman, and we've got one.

417
00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:22,974
Who, me? I'm a disabled seaman.

418
00:28:23,033 --> 00:28:26,014
Anyhow, I never did have
no executive ability.

419
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:29,108
- I think maybe Sparks there...
- No, not me.

420
00:28:29,173 --> 00:28:33,144
I know a bit about navigation, but when it
comes to taking charge of a boat, well...

421
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:35,156
What about Kovac?

422
00:28:35,212 --> 00:28:39,786
That clunk run this boat?
With what? An oil can?

423
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:43,696
If you're talking about a skipper,
we have a skipper right on this boat.

424
00:28:43,754 --> 00:28:46,598
- He wasn't the captain.
- Wasn't he?

425
00:28:46,657 --> 00:28:48,864
<i>- Herr Kapitan?
- Ja?</i>

426
00:28:48,926 --> 00:28:52,169
Well, I'm a monkey's uncle!

427
00:28:52,229 --> 00:28:54,505
There. You have a man who's
familiar with these waters.

428
00:28:54,565 --> 00:28:57,341
He knows seamanship and navigation.
What about it?

429
00:28:57,401 --> 00:29:00,280
You want to turn the boat over to the man who
sunk our ship and shelled our lifeboats?

430
00:29:00,337 --> 00:29:04,342
I want you to turn the boat over to the man
obviously best qualified to run it.

431
00:29:04,408 --> 00:29:06,354
- You're crazy.
- <i>[ Ritt ] Now, wait a minute.</i>

432
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:10,085
There are two sides to everything.
Let's look at this calmly and reasonably.

433
00:29:10,147 --> 00:29:12,457
The gentleman is just as anxious
to get to safety as we are.

434
00:29:12,516 --> 00:29:15,122
If he's a trained skipper,
why shouldn't he take charge?

435
00:29:15,185 --> 00:29:17,791
- Because I'm taking charge!
- Since when?

436
00:29:17,855 --> 00:29:21,530
As of now, I'm skipper. Anybody who don't

Genus Homo. Male.

732

<i>I didn't mind her prying, really.
I wanted to talk.</i>

745
00:51:15,871 --> 00:51:19,080
Maybe that's why I'm all mixed up,
because I've never told anybody.

746
00:51:21,877 --> 00:51:24,949
I think I'd rather tell you
than anybody.

His name is Stephen.

748
00:51:30,219 --> 00:51:34,463
He's a doctor.
We worked in the same hospital.

749
00:51:34,523 --> 00:51:37,094
All the time,
I knew he was married.

750
00:51:37,159 --> 00:51:41,073
His wife's a fine woman,
and they have two beautiful children.

751
00:51:42,431 --> 00:51:45,878
So, you see, it was hopeless.
It was quite hopeless.

752
00:51:46,869 --> 00:51:49,850
Yes, of course. I-I see.

753
00:51:49,905 --> 00:51:53,352
Well, we both decided
to forget about it.

754
00:51:53,408 --> 00:51:58,687
And when he enlisted
and was sent to London, I was glad.

755
00:51:58,747 --> 00:52:00,954
I was really glad.

756

I tried to forget him,
but I couldn't.

757

He wrote several times.
I never answered.

758
00:52:09,391 --> 00:52:13,100
And then when I was
assigned to London myself...

759

Maybe I better wait till I get home and take
it up with Mr. Whosits on the Goodwill Hour.

762
00:52:26,408 --> 00:52:29,287

Sometimes it isn't a bit.

764

When people are in trouble,
they turn themselves inside-out.

765
00:52:38,453 --> 00:52:41,957

get some sort of an answer.

- That's right. Yes.

772
00:53:08,016 --> 00:53:11,987
He was telling me all about his wife
going to stay with her family in Bermuda.

773
00:53:12,054 --> 00:53:14,000
And how it's changed
since the war.

He told me that...

775
00:53:16,491 --> 00:53:20,496
I remember as he pointed out
our course over the bows...

776
00:53:20,562 --> 00:53:23,338
I saw the planet Mars
low on the horizon.

777

That's Mars over there,

He might have been mistaken.

788
00:54:13,515 --> 00:54:15,688
When I questioned him yesterday,
he didn't want to commit himself.

789
00:54:15,751 --> 00:54:17,697
He said we couldn't be sure
without a compass.

790
00:54:17,753 --> 00:54:19,699
The thing to do is to wake him up

795
00:54:30,866 --> 00:54:34,746
Mrs. Porter, remember yesterday you looked
at your watch and told the German the time?

796
00:54:34,803 --> 00:54:36,749
- Yes.
- Did he ask you the time?

797
00:54:36,805 --> 00:54:38,751
Of course he did.

798
00:54:38,807 --> 00:54:41,219
- That's funny.
- What's funny about it?

799
00:54:41,276 --> 00:54:43,586
- He had a watch of his own.
- Well, what of it?

800
00:54:43,645 --> 00:54:46,717
If he had a watch, why would he
have to ask Mrs. Porter for the time?

801
00:54:46,782 --> 00:54:48,728
That doesn't prove anything.

802
00:54:48,784 --> 00:54:51,526
Lots of times I have my own watch
in my pocket and I ask somebody the time.

803
00:54:51,586 --> 00:54:55,033
Lots of people do that. It, uh...
it just saves time, that's all.

804
00:54:55,090 --> 00:54:57,969
But he looked at his own watch
just before he asked Mrs. Porter.

805
00:54:58,026 --> 00:55:00,404
Perhaps his own watch stopped.

806
00:55:00,462 --> 00:55:03,602
I remember when he asked for the time,
he took a squint at the sun.

807

What are you trying to do, convict a man
because he looks at the sun?

808
00:55:06,068 --> 00:55:08,912
- Is it a crime to ask for the time?
- [Kovac] Certainly not.

00:55:08,970 --> 00:55:12,611

- Ten past 7:00.

01:00:48,009 --> 01:00:51,684
That's one for the book... your book.

877
01:00:51,746 --> 01:00:54,625
Only, when you write it,
they won't believe it.

878
01:00:54,682 --> 01:00:57,356
Our enemy...
our prisoner of war.

879
01:00:57,419 --> 01:01:00,628
Now, we're his prisoners,
and he's gauleiter of the boat...

880
01:01:00,688 --> 01:01:02,668
singin' German lullabies
to us...

881
01:01:02,724 --> 01:01:05,204
while he rows us
to his supply ship...

882
01:01:05,260 --> 01:01:07,934
and a concentration camp.

883

Tell 'em, Willi.
Tell 'em how funny it is.

884
01:01:10,098 --> 01:01:13,238
That isn't funny. It's logical.

885
01:01:13,301 --> 01:01:17,249
Now that we've been blown of four course,
it would take us weeks to get to Bermuda.

886
01:01:17,305 --> 01:01:20,115
Certainly. It's perfectly logical.
The supply ship was our only chance.

887
01:01:20,175 --> 01:01:23,520
You know howl feel about that. I'd rather
take my chances with the sharks.

888
01:01:23,578 --> 01:01:25,888
But he'll never make it.

889
01:01:25,947 --> 01:01:28,427
Without food and water, how long do
you think he can keep on rowing like this?

890
01:01:28,483 --> 01:01:31,692
Long enough, Mr. Kovac,
to reach my objective.

891
01:01:31,753 --> 01:01:33,790
Are you sure, Willi?

892
01:01:33,855 --> 01:01:36,199
Maybe one of us should had better
try to relieve him at the oars.

893
01:01:36,257 --> 01:01:39,466
- That's not necessary.
- Maybe I can take over for a while.

894
01:01:39,527 --> 01:01:41,507
Never mind, I'll row.

895
01:01:41,563 --> 01:01:44,772
How can you keep on rowing,
Willi, hour after hour?

896
01:01:44,833 --> 01:01:46,779
The rest of us
can hardly lift an oar.

897
01:01:46,835 --> 01:01:50,214
It's the master race...
the herrenvolk.

898
01:01:50,271 --> 01:01:54,185

- I'm beginning to believe it.

899

Right living is what does it.
Or, as the French say...

902
01:02:04,552 --> 01:02:08,193
- Yes. I spent some time in Paris.
- Oh, yes.

903
01:02:08,256 --> 01:02:12,136
Tell me, Willi. Why didn't you speak
English when you first got on the boat?

904
01:02:12,193 --> 01:02:16,266
Well, you see, I didn't know then
whether I could trust you or not.

905
01:02:18,399 --> 01:02:21,107
<i>Wie gehts, Herr Schmidt?</i>

906
01:02:21,169 --> 01:02:23,877
- Name is Smith.
- [Chuckles]

907
01:02:23,938 --> 01:02:26,646
All right, Mr. Smith.
How do you feel today?

908
01:02:26,708 --> 01:02:30,520
Same as yesterday- thirsty.

909
01:02:30,578 --> 01:02:35,823
Well, steward, anything
from the commissary yet?

910
01:02:35,884 --> 01:02:39,593
- Not even a nibble.
- Well, keep on trying.

911
01:02:39,654 --> 01:02:43,625
If you catch some fish,
you'll not only have food, but drink.

912
01:02:43,691 --> 01:02:46,604
When you chew raw fish,
there's always a little fresh water.

913
01:02:46,661 --> 01:02:48,766
Water.

914
01:02:50,398 --> 01:02:52,878
There's that cloud.

915
01:02:52,934 --> 01:02:56,438
What a day for a ball game.

916
01:02:56,504 --> 01:02:58,848
St. Louie's the team
to watch this year.

917

If we only had some bait.

918

- Yeah.

922
01:03:10,952 --> 01:03:13,796
If the Dodgers only had a guy like
Ernie Bonham, or even Johnnie Humphries.

923
01:03:13,855 --> 01:03:15,801
Pittsburgh's the team to watch.

924
01:03:15,857 --> 01:03:18,770
Only 17 points below St. Louis.

925
01:03:18,826 --> 01:03:22,330
If we beat the Pirates
and St. Louis loses to Boston...

926
01:03:22,397 --> 01:03:24,502
- Hey, Kovac.
- Yeah.

927

Who do you think'll
pitch for Pittsburgh today?

928
01:03:28,970 --> 01:03:32,008
I don't know. I haven't been
following the games much this season.

929
01:03:32,073 --> 01:03:36,021
Probably Wyatt for the Dodgers,
Sewell for the Pirates.

930
01:03:36,077 --> 01:03:38,990
Yeah. Probably Sewell, Gus.

931
