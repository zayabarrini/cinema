1
00:01:57,972 --> 00:01:59,906
Stall, please.

2
00:02:37,432 --> 00:02:39,127
Ladies and gentlemen...

3
00:02:39,227 --> 00:02:42,450
with your kind attention
and permission...

4
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:45,713
I have the honor
of presenting to you...

5
00:02:45,813 --> 00:02:48,689
one of the most remarkable
men in the world.

6
00:02:48,789 --> 00:02:51,617
- How remarkable?
- He's sweating.

7
00:02:52,994 --> 00:02:55,397
And can you be surprised
at that, gentlemen?

8
00:02:55,497 --> 00:02:58,550
Every day
he commits to memory

9
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,097
50 new facts...

10
00:03:00,197 --> 00:03:02,050
and remembers
every one of them.

11
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:05,840
Facts from history, from
geography, from newspapers...

12
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:09,460
from scientific books,
millions and millions of them.

13
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,796
Think of the strain involved
by his prodigious feat.

14
00:03:13,896 --> 00:03:16,783
His feet ain't half as big
as yours, cully.

15
00:03:17,637 --> 00:03:20,137
I'm referring to his
feats of memory.

16
00:03:21,074 --> 00:03:22,447
Test him, please.

17
00:03:22,547 --> 00:03:25,567
Ladies and gentlemen,
ask him your questions...

18
00:03:25,667 --> 00:03:28,883
and he will answer you,
fully and freely.

19
00:03:28,983 --> 00:03:30,783
Mr. Memory.

20
00:03:33,768 --> 00:03:37,397
I also add, ladies and gentlemen,
before retiring...

21
00:03:37,497 --> 00:03:42,149
that Mr. Memory has left his brain
to the British Museum.

22
00:03:42,249 --> 00:03:44,549
Hurray!

23
00:03:48,001 --> 00:03:50,090
A question, please.
Ladies first.

24
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,460
Where's my old man been
since last Saturday?

25
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,047
- On the booze!
- In quod!

26
00:03:55,147 --> 00:03:56,910
Out with his bit!

27
00:03:58,546 --> 00:04:00,999
A serious question, please.

28
00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:03,646
Um, what won the Derby in 1921?

29
00:04:03,746 --> 00:04:05,993

with Steve Donoghue up.

30
00:04:06,093 --> 00:04:07,840
Won by a length
at odds 6 to 1.

31
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,333
Second and third:
Craig-an-Eran and Lemonora.

32
00:04:10,433 --> 00:04:12,373
- Am I right, sir?
- Right.

33
00:04:12,473 --> 00:04:14,806
What won in 1936?

34
00:04:14,906 --> 00:04:18,539
You come back in 1937,
and I'll tell you, sir.

35
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,905
How far is Winnipeg
from Montreal?

36
00:04:21,005 --> 00:04:23,063
What won the Cup in 1926?

37
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:25,837
Cup? Waterloo,
football or tea, sir?

38
00:04:25,937 --> 00:04:27,570
Football, silly.

39
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:28,950
When did Chelsea win it?

40
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:32,450
63 B.C. in the presence
of the emperor Nero.

41
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:37,476
- What causes pip in poultry?
- Ssh! Don't make yourself so common.

42
00:04:37,576 --> 00:04:40,376
But our fowls have got it,
haven't they now?

43
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:44,449
How many races
did Mick the Miller win?

44
00:04:44,549 --> 00:04:45,896
How old is Mae West?

45
00:04:45,996 --> 00:04:47,889
When was Crippen hanged?

46
00:04:47,989 --> 00:04:51,042
Who was the last British
heavyweight champion of the world?

47
00:04:51,142 --> 00:04:54,142
- Henry VIII!
- My old woman!

48
00:04:56,237 --> 00:04:58,383
Bob Fitzsimmons.
He defeated Jim Corbett...

49
00:04:58,483 --> 00:05:01,335
heavyweight champion of America
at Carson City, Nevada...

50
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:03,630
in October, 1897.

51
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:06,683
He was then 34 years of age.
Am I right, sir?

52
00:05:06,783 --> 00:05:08,482
How old is Mae West?

53
00:05:08,582 --> 00:05:11,282
I know, sir, but I never
tell a lady's age.

54
00:05:13,116 --> 00:05:14,916
Next, please.

55
00:05:16,617 --> 00:05:19,908
What causes pip in poultry?

56
00:05:20,008 --> 00:05:23,241
- How far is Winnipeg from Montreal?
- Miss Winnie Who, sir?

57
00:05:23,341 --> 00:05:25,186
How far is Winnipeg from Montreal?

58
00:05:25,286 --> 00:05:28,586
Uuh, a gentleman from Canada.
You're welcome, sir.

59
00:05:29,844 --> 00:05:33,875
Winnipeg, the third city of Canada and
the capital of the province of Manitoba.

60
00:05:33,975 --> 00:05:38,387
Distance from Montreal:
1,424 miles.

61
00:05:38,487 --> 00:05:40,688
- Am I right, sir?
- Quite right.

62
00:05:44,892 --> 00:05:46,892
How old's Mae West?

63
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:53,392
How old's Mae West?

64
00:06:00,487 --> 00:06:01,989
Hey, you!

65
00:06:03,524 --> 00:06:05,524
How old's Mae West?

66
00:06:06,197 --> 00:06:08,124
Gentlemen, gentlemen!

67
00:06:08,224 --> 00:06:10,724
Please, you're not at home!

68
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:15,441
Hey, you!

69
00:06:17,925 --> 00:06:19,994
What causes pip in...

70
00:06:20,094 --> 00:06:22,894
causes pip in po-po-po...

71
00:06:37,911 --> 00:06:39,435
Hey, come on!

72
00:06:40,571 --> 00:06:44,871
Hey! For God's sake, play something
man and stop this panic!

73
00:07:04,289 --> 00:07:06,089
Well, here we are.

74
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:09,540
May I come home with you?

75
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,733
What's the idea?

76
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:14,028
Well, I'd like to.

77
00:07:14,128 --> 00:07:16,406
Why, it's your funeral.

78
00:07:16,506 --> 00:07:18,406
Go on then, there's a bus.

79
00:07:42,715 --> 00:07:43,849
You don't stay here always?

80
00:07:43,949 --> 00:07:48,623
No, I've taken a furnished flat. I'm only
over here from Canada for a few months.

81
00:07:48,723 --> 00:07:51,323
By the way, am I allowed
to know your name?

82
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,821
Smith?

83
00:07:54,921 --> 00:07:56,521
All right.

84
00:08:03,092 --> 00:08:06,767
Do you want to know more about me?
What do you think I do for a living?

85
00:08:06,867 --> 00:08:08,088
Actress?

86
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:09,700
Not in the way you mean.

87
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,753
- Chorus?
- No.

88
00:08:11,853 --> 00:08:14,293
- I'm sorry.
- I'm a freelance.

89
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:16,679
- Out for adventure, eh?
- That's right. - This way.

90
00:08:16,779 --> 00:08:19,702
I'm afraid you'll find my sitting room
all upset, I had the decorators in.

91
00:08:19,802 --> 00:08:22,539
- Wait till I'll find the switch.
- Not yet.

92
00:08:35,088 --> 00:08:36,788
Now.

93
00:08:45,516 --> 00:08:46,623
Mr. Hannay.

94
00:08:46,723 --> 00:08:51,123
Would you be so very kind and turn
that mirror with its face to the wall?

95
00:09:02,198 --> 00:09:04,525
You'd be happier if there were
curtains over those windows.

96
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:06,825
- Yes.
- I'm sorry.

97
00:09:08,855 --> 00:09:10,555
Hello, there's a telephone.

98
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,855
Just a minute.

99
00:09:13,421 --> 00:09:15,788
Mr. Hannay, don't
answer the telephone.

100
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,174
Why not?

101
00:09:17,274 --> 00:09:20,874
Because I think it's for me.
Please don't answer.

102
00:09:23,051 --> 00:09:24,751
Just as you say, miss.

103
00:09:26,911 --> 00:09:28,397
Won't you sit down?

104
00:09:28,497 --> 00:09:31,697
Thanks, If you'd please kick
that footstool over to me?

105
00:09:51,245 --> 00:09:52,892
You needed that.

106
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:54,589
I did.

107
00:09:54,689 --> 00:09:56,192
Thank you.

108
00:10:00,861 --> 00:10:02,514
I owe you an explanation.

109
00:10:02,614 --> 00:10:05,075
Oh, don't bother about me.
I'm nobody.

110
00:10:06,446 --> 00:10:08,146
We cannot talk here.

111
00:10:10,472 --> 00:10:12,172
All right.

112
00:10:23,329 --> 00:10:25,529
Just a minute.

113
00:10:31,966 --> 00:10:33,900
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

114
00:10:35,929 --> 00:10:38,129
- Cigarette?
- No, thank you.

115
00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:44,909
- Our friend again.
- Take no notice.

116
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:06,477
Would you think me very troublesome
if I asked for something to eat?

117
00:11:06,577 --> 00:11:09,307
- I've had nothing all day.
- Sure.

118
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:16,910
- You like haddock?
- Yes, please.

119
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,534
I suppose your name
isn't really Smith.

120
00:11:19,634 --> 00:11:21,755
Depends on where I am.

121
00:11:21,855 --> 00:11:24,575
- You may call me Annabella.
- Annabella Smith.

122
00:11:24,675 --> 00:11:27,075
A clergyman's daughter, I'd say.

123
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,360
Hello. Nervy?

124
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,460
Upset by those shots tonight?

125
00:11:33,167 --> 00:11:35,274
I fired those shots.

126
00:11:35,374 --> 00:11:38,174
- You what?
- Yes, to create a diversion.

127
00:11:38,752 --> 00:11:41,701
You see, I had to get away
from that theater quickly.

128
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:43,821
There were two men there

129
00:11:43,921 --> 00:11:45,531
who wanted to kill me.

130
00:11:45,631 --> 00:11:48,279
Really, you should be more careful
choosing your gentlemen friends.

131
00:11:48,379 --> 00:11:51,874
- No-no-no, you don't understand.
- You don't make it easy for me, do you?

132
00:11:51,974 --> 00:11:55,174
Beautiful, mysterious woman
pursued by gunmen.

133
00:11:55,274 --> 00:11:57,265
Sounds like a spy story.

134
00:11:57,365 --> 00:11:59,531
It's exactly what it is.

135
00:11:59,631 --> 00:12:02,051
Only I prefer the
word agent better.

136
00:12:02,151 --> 00:12:05,070
- "Agent"? For what country?
- Any country that pays me.

137
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:08,804
- No, what is your country?
- I have no country.

138
00:12:08,904 --> 00:12:12,710
Born in a balloon, rare.
We'll let that go.

139
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:17,276
Now I suppose you've come over here
to dig up some great big state secret.

140
00:12:17,376 --> 00:12:20,828
No, I am here to save a secret
from being dug up.

141
00:12:20,928 --> 00:12:23,508
Very important secret
for this country.

142
00:12:23,608 --> 00:12:26,968
Not because I love England, but because
it will pay me better that way.

143
00:12:27,068 --> 00:12:29,701
- Thank you.
- You see, the very brilliant agent...

144
00:12:29,801 --> 00:12:31,986
of a certain foreign power...

145
00:12:32,086 --> 00:12:34,533
is on the point of
obtaining a secret

146
00:12:34,633 --> 00:12:37,173
vital to your air defense.

147
00:12:37,273 --> 00:12:40,194
I tracked two of his men
to that music hall.

148
00:12:40,294 --> 00:12:42,007
Unfortunately,
they recognized me.

149
00:12:42,107 --> 00:12:45,147
- That's why they're after me now.
- That was too bad.

150
00:12:45,247 --> 00:12:48,559
You ever heard of a thing
called "persecution mania"?

151
00:12:48,659 --> 00:12:51,459
- You don't believe me?
- Frankly, I don't.

152
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:53,959
Go and look down
onto the street then.

153
00:13:24,775 --> 00:13:26,211
You win.

154
00:13:26,311 --> 00:13:28,972
- Are they there?
- Yes.

155
00:13:29,072 --> 00:13:32,508
I hoped I'd shaken them off.

156
00:13:32,608 --> 00:13:36,514
Listen, I'm going to tell you something
which is not very healthy to know.

157
00:13:36,614 --> 00:13:39,354
But now that they have
followed me here...

158
00:13:39,454 --> 00:13:41,718
you are in it
as much as I am.

159
00:13:41,818 --> 00:13:43,682
How do you mean?

160
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:47,882
- Have you ever heard of the 39 Steps?
- No, what's that, a pub?

161
00:13:48,922 --> 00:13:50,642
Never mind.

162
00:13:50,742 --> 00:13:53,942
But what you were laughing at
just now is true.

163
00:13:54,355 --> 00:13:58,352
These men will stick at nothing. I'm
the only person who can stop them.

164
00:13:58,452 --> 00:14:02,022
If they are not stopped, it's only
a matter of days, perhaps hours...

165
00:14:02,122 --> 00:14:03,923
before the secret is
out of the country.

166
00:14:04,023 --> 00:14:06,355
Why don't you phone
the police, or something?

167
00:14:06,455 --> 00:14:09,115
Because they wouldn't believe me
any more than you did.

168
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:13,086
And if they did, how long do you think
it would take to get them going?

169
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,349
These men act quickly.

170
00:14:15,449 --> 00:14:18,236
You don't know
how clever their chief is.

171
00:14:18,336 --> 00:14:22,227
- Clever and ruthless.
- Who is he? What's his name?

172
00:14:22,327 --> 00:14:23,967
He has a dozen names,

173
00:14:24,067 --> 00:14:26,567
and he can look like
a hundred people.

174
00:14:26,667 --> 00:14:29,740
But one thing he
cannot disguise...

175
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,293
this.

176
00:14:31,393 --> 00:14:33,686
Part of his little
finger is missing.

177
00:14:33,786 --> 00:14:36,899
So, If ever you should meet a man
with no top joint there...

178
00:14:36,999 --> 00:14:41,151
- be very careful, my friend.
- Thanks, I'll make a note of it.

179
00:14:41,251 --> 00:14:43,444
Meanwhile, what are
you going to do?

180
00:14:43,544 --> 00:14:45,151
First, I'll eat my haddock...

181
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:46,351
and then,

182
00:14:46,451 --> 00:14:49,257
if you are not going to
turn me out into the street...

183
00:14:49,357 --> 00:14:52,763
- have a good night's rest.
- Oh, you're welcome to my bed.

184
00:14:52,863 --> 00:14:55,776
I'll get a shakedown
on the couch.

185
00:14:55,876 --> 00:14:58,196
Anything else I can get you?

186
00:14:58,296 --> 00:15:01,849
- A map of Scotland.
- Why Scotland?

187
00:15:01,949 --> 00:15:06,549
There's a man in Scotland whom I must
visit next if anything is to be done.

188
00:15:09,423 --> 00:15:13,607
Are the 39 Steps in Scotland,
by any chance?

189
00:15:13,707 --> 00:15:16,007
Perhaps I'll tell you tomorrow.

190
00:15:32,645 --> 00:15:34,356
Clear out, Hannay.

191
00:15:34,456 --> 00:15:36,456
They'll get you next.

192
00:16:24,131 --> 00:16:27,104
What you were
laughing at just now...

193
00:16:27,204 --> 00:16:29,004
is true.

194
00:16:31,058 --> 00:16:34,358
These men will stop at nothing.

195
00:17:09,816 --> 00:17:12,944
There's a man in Scotland...

196
00:17:13,044 --> 00:17:17,346
whom I must visit next
if anything is to be done.

197
00:17:18,739 --> 00:17:23,739
It is only a matter of days,
perhaps hours...

198
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:27,610
before the secret
is out of the country.

199
00:17:28,901 --> 00:17:33,301
The police would not believe me
any more than you did.

200
00:17:35,142 --> 00:17:38,771
I tell you,
these men act quickly.

201
00:17:40,047 --> 00:17:41,547
Quickly.

202
00:17:42,466 --> 00:17:43,967
Quickly.

203
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:35,052
Oh, good morning, sir. You're up
bright and early this morning.

204
00:18:37,271 --> 00:18:39,092
Could you use a
pound note, brother?

205
00:18:39,192 --> 00:18:41,434
- What's the catch?
- I want to borrow your cap and coat.

206
00:18:41,534 --> 00:18:43,434
Wait a minute, what's this?
What's the big idea?

207
00:18:43,534 --> 00:18:46,264
- I want to make a getaway.
- Do a bunk? - Yes.

208
00:18:46,364 --> 00:18:48,470
What have you been up to?

209
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:49,910
I'll have to trust you.

210
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:52,920
There's been a murder committed
up on the first floor.

211
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,616
- By you?
- No, no.

212
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:56,442
By those two men out there.

213
00:18:58,906 --> 00:19:01,618
I see... Now, I suppose they're
waiting there as good as gold...

214
00:19:01,718 --> 00:19:04,084
- for a copper to come and arrest them.
- It's quite true, listen.

215
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:05,762
They're spies, foreigners.

216
00:19:05,862 --> 00:19:08,549
They've murdered a woman in my flat,
and now they're waiting for me.

217
00:19:08,649 --> 00:19:11,229
Oh, come off it. Funny jokes
at 5:00 in the morning.

218
00:19:11,329 --> 00:19:13,055
All right, all right.

219
00:19:13,155 --> 00:19:14,955
I'll tell you the truth.

220
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:18,352
- Are you married?
- Yes, but don't rub it in.

221
00:19:18,452 --> 00:19:20,934
- What's the idea now?
- Well I'm not, you see, I'm a bachelor.

222
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:24,037
- Oh, are you?
- A married woman lives on the first floor.

223
00:19:24,137 --> 00:19:28,537
- Does she?
- Yes and I've just been paying her a call.

224
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:32,943
- And now I want to go home.
- Well, what's preventing you?

225
00:19:33,043 --> 00:19:35,696
One of those men is her brother,
the other's her husband.

226
00:19:35,796 --> 00:19:36,796
Now do you see?

227
00:19:36,896 --> 00:19:40,420
Why didn't you tell me before old
fellow? I only wanted to be told.

228
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,274
Trying to keep me with a lot of tales
about murders and foreigners.

229
00:19:43,374 --> 00:19:45,927
Here, put this on. Put on my
little hat. There you are.

230
00:19:46,027 --> 00:19:47,027
Take the pound.

231
00:19:47,127 --> 00:19:51,693
No-no-no, sir, you're welcome to it.
You'd do the same for me one day.

232
00:19:51,793 --> 00:19:53,893
Leave the pony around the corner.

233
00:19:55,642 --> 00:19:58,042
- So long, old sport.
- Good-bye, thank you.

234
00:20:03,078 --> 00:20:05,078
Oi! The empties!

235
00:20:16,067 --> 00:20:20,567
Papers, magazines,
chocolates, cigarettes.

236
00:20:21,863 --> 00:20:24,263
- Highland Express!
- Mind the gap, please!

237
00:20:36,216 --> 00:20:38,216
Quickly! There he is.

238
00:20:56,561 --> 00:20:59,846
Well, for one thing, they're much
prettier than they were 20 years ago.

239
00:20:59,946 --> 00:21:02,917
- More free. Free and easy.
- You're right there.

240
00:21:03,017 --> 00:21:06,059
I can never understand how people used
to put up with the old-fashioned sort.

241
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:07,799
All bones and no bend.

242
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:10,017
Well I will say for the old-fashioned
it did last longer.

243
00:21:10,117 --> 00:21:12,452
I don't know.
Mine last about a year.

244
00:21:12,552 --> 00:21:14,191
Here, I'll show you.

245
00:21:14,681 --> 00:21:16,876
Big demand for these now.

246
00:21:19,158 --> 00:21:22,167
- The old-fashioned sort.
- Brrr! My wife.

247
00:21:22,267 --> 00:21:24,064
Now take a look at these.

248
00:21:24,164 --> 00:21:27,754
Our new Streamline Model number one.
What I've been talking to you about.

249
00:21:27,854 --> 00:21:30,184
- Anything go with it?
- I should say so.

250
00:21:30,284 --> 00:21:31,290
This.

251
00:21:32,478 --> 00:21:35,647
Put a pretty girl inside those, and she
needn't be ashamed of herself anywhere.

252
00:21:35,747 --> 00:21:37,632
All right. Bring it back
to me when it's filled.

253
00:21:37,732 --> 00:21:38,932
I will.

254
00:21:39,328 --> 00:21:40,568
Well, watch this.

255
00:21:40,668 --> 00:21:43,010
Edinburgh, Waverley.
Hm, we're getting on.

256
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:45,247
I hope you'll pardon us for
talking business, sir.

257
00:21:45,347 --> 00:21:47,449
Oh, certainly. Certainly.

258
00:21:48,421 --> 00:21:50,323
- Good day to you.
- Good day, sir.

259
00:21:50,423 --> 00:21:51,827
Good day.

260
00:21:56,505 --> 00:21:58,803
- Um-um, good day.
- Broad-minded old geezer.

261
00:21:58,903 --> 00:22:01,103
I bet he's very good at charades.

262
00:22:01,734 --> 00:22:05,104
- I wonder what won the 2:00 at Windsor.
- I don't know. Let's get a paper.

263
00:22:08,709 --> 00:22:11,836
- Dispatch.
- Hey, son, speaky the English?

264
00:22:11,936 --> 00:22:13,136
Dispatch.

265
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:21,030
- Hello.
- Well, what won it?

266
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:23,330
There's been another woman
murdered in a West End flat.

267
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:26,343
- What?  - "Woman
 murdered in West End flat."

268
00:22:26,443 --> 00:22:28,663
Ah, these sex dramas don't
appeal to me. What won?

269
00:22:28,763 --> 00:22:29,983
- Um, Bachelor Bud.
- Good.

270
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:32,089
- Seven to four odds.
- Ooh! Not so good.

271
00:22:32,189 --> 00:22:33,809
Portland Mansions,
Portland Place.

272
00:22:33,909 --> 00:22:36,922
By the BBC. That's a nice, quiet
place to put someone to sleep.

273
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,735
"Good night, everybody.
Good night."

274
00:22:39,835 --> 00:22:41,188
That's a good one.

275
00:22:41,288 --> 00:22:43,461
What was she like?
One of the usual?

276
00:22:43,561 --> 00:22:47,153
"A well-dressed woman of about 35
with a knife in her back.

277
00:22:47,253 --> 00:22:48,821
The tenant, Richard
Hannay, is missing."

278
00:22:48,921 --> 00:22:50,914
You surprise me.

279
00:22:52,188 --> 00:22:56,342
"At 7:00 this morning, the
charwoman, Elizabeth Briggs... "

280
00:22:56,442 --> 00:22:57,962
Well, if that isn't
the blasted limit.

281
00:22:58,062 --> 00:23:01,168
- What's the matter now?
- Is there no honesty in this world at all?

282
00:23:01,268 --> 00:23:02,448
I ask you.

283
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:05,117
"The new Bodyline
rubber panty corset.

284
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:10,190
On sale today. McCutcheon Brothers,
Princess Street. Price: 17 and 9.

285
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:14,008
Brassiere to match: 4 and 11."
Do you get that?

286
00:23:14,108 --> 00:23:17,801
The Bodyline. 1 and 3
cheaper than our Streamline.

287
00:23:17,901 --> 00:23:19,399
No use going to Aberdeen now.

288
00:23:19,499 --> 00:23:21,080
Might I have a look
at your paper?

289
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,381
Certainly.

290
00:23:37,811 --> 00:23:40,302
- Thank you.
- Quite all right.

291
00:24:01,949 --> 00:24:04,949
There's enough evidence
there to hang any man.

292
00:24:06,175 --> 00:24:07,968
What can I do for you, sir?

293
00:24:08,068 --> 00:24:11,854
Oh... c-can you tell me what
station the train stops at next?

294
00:24:11,954 --> 00:24:16,265
Who you think I'm a railway porter?
Go and find out for yourself.

295
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:23,974
I can tell a better one
than that first for you.

296
00:24:24,074 --> 00:24:26,734
- You couldn't. That was very funny.
- You liked it, didn't you?

297
00:24:26,834 --> 00:24:28,707
Have you heard the one about
the young lady of Ongar?

298
00:24:28,807 --> 00:24:31,490
- I don't know, I can't remember them all.
- Oh, you must hear that.

299
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:34,194
- There was a young lady of Ongar.
- Yes, we, uh...

300
00:24:55,291 --> 00:24:57,691
- Taking tea, sir?
- Yes. Thank you.

301
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:27,353
Darling, how lovely to see you!

302
00:25:34,975 --> 00:25:37,375
Young man having
a free meal in there.

303
00:25:39,265 --> 00:25:41,838
I was desperate. I'm terribly sorry.
I had to do it, look here.

304
00:25:41,938 --> 00:25:44,425
My name's Hannay, they're after me.
I swear I'm innocent.

305
00:25:44,525 --> 00:25:47,893
You've got to help me. I've got
to keep free for the next few days.

306
00:25:47,993 --> 00:25:50,893
Well, have you seen a man pass
in the last few minutes?

307
00:25:52,572 --> 00:25:54,730
This is the man you want, I think.

308
00:25:56,105 --> 00:25:59,778
- When we passed just now. - Forced his way
in here and told me his name was Hannay.

309
00:25:59,878 --> 00:26:01,144
- Is your name Hannay?
- No.

310
00:26:01,244 --> 00:26:04,250
- Are you coming in to tea, sir?
- I'll be right along.

311
00:26:14,373 --> 00:26:15,873
Pull that cord!

312
00:26:49,968 --> 00:26:51,201
Right down with you.

313
00:26:51,301 --> 00:26:53,502
Go on, men. Go to the
other end, would you?

314
00:26:53,602 --> 00:26:55,632
Get on with it.

315
00:27:01,045 --> 00:27:04,071
Hear! Hear! What for did you
pull the communication cord?

316
00:27:04,171 --> 00:27:05,358
To stop the train, you old fool.

317
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:08,078
It's against all the regulations
to stop the train on a bridge.

318
00:27:08,178 --> 00:27:10,317
But a man jumped down. He's a
murderer, we've got to chase him.

319
00:27:10,417 --> 00:27:12,256
- Which way did he go?
- He must have jumped off here.

320
00:27:12,356 --> 00:27:13,956
I cannot see him.
Are you sure he jumped?

321
00:27:14,056 --> 00:27:16,698
Anyway, I cannot
wait here any longer!

322
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:18,991
- There he is, getting on the train.
- No, that's a passenger.

323
00:27:19,091 --> 00:27:21,591
- It's he, I tell you!
- Come on with you, then.

324
00:27:38,391 --> 00:27:42,104
- Hannay escapes! Paper!
- Hannay escapes! Paper!

325
00:27:42,204 --> 00:27:46,451
Paper! Extra special! Paper!
Sensational escape on Forth Bridge!

326
00:27:46,551 --> 00:27:48,143
Paper!

327
00:27:53,363 --> 00:27:55,636
Extra, extra! Paper!

328
00:27:55,736 --> 00:27:58,965
Correct. Height:
about five foot ten.

329
00:27:59,065 --> 00:28:01,105
Small moustache.

330
00:28:01,205 --> 00:28:04,089
Last seen wearing a dark suit...

331
00:28:04,189 --> 00:28:07,691
but he may have obtained
a change of clothing.

332
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:44,687
- Good day.
- And to you.

333
00:28:46,241 --> 00:28:49,002
- What'll your business be?
- I'm a motor mechanic, looking for a job.

334
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:52,178
- You'll find no work about here.
- Oh, are there no big houses around here?

335
00:28:52,278 --> 00:28:54,178
Only Sir Andrews, and
he won't be wanting you.

336
00:28:54,278 --> 00:28:55,891
He's had the same
chauffeur for 40 years.

337
00:28:55,991 --> 00:28:57,754
I didn't know there'd
been cars that long.

338
00:28:57,854 --> 00:28:59,617
He was coachman besides
when he was a boy.

339
00:28:59,717 --> 00:29:01,117
Oh, I see.

340
00:29:01,743 --> 00:29:03,143
Oh, what's that?

341
00:29:03,543 --> 00:29:06,349
That's the manse. But the
minister hasn't got a motorcar.

342
00:29:06,871 --> 00:29:08,509
Are there no newcomers?

343
00:29:08,609 --> 00:29:11,535
Aye, there's an Englishman,
a kind of professor.

344
00:29:11,635 --> 00:29:13,706
- Professor?
- He lives in Alt-na-Shellach.

345
00:29:13,806 --> 00:29:16,138
- Where?  - Alt-na-Shellach,
on the other side of the loch.

346
00:29:16,238 --> 00:29:18,539
Oh, would that be
near that village?

347
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:19,982
It would.

348
00:29:20,336 --> 00:29:22,148
Thanks.
Thanks, I'll try there.

349
00:29:22,248 --> 00:29:25,075
You won't try tonight.
It's 14 miles.

350
00:29:25,508 --> 00:29:27,008
Maybe get a lift in that van?

351
00:29:27,108 --> 00:29:28,214
No.

352
00:29:28,887 --> 00:29:30,187
Going the other way.

353
00:29:37,953 --> 00:29:39,527
I guess you're right.

354
00:29:39,627 --> 00:29:41,601
Um, could you put me up
for the night somehow?

355
00:29:41,701 --> 00:29:43,896
- Free?
- No, I'll pay.

356
00:29:43,996 --> 00:29:47,599
- All right. Can you eat the herring?
- I could eat half a dozen right now.

357
00:29:47,699 --> 00:29:50,076
- Can you sleep in a box bed?
- I can try.

358
00:29:50,176 --> 00:29:53,202
- Two and six.
- Take it now. Thank you.

359
00:29:55,014 --> 00:29:56,614
Go in with the gentleman.

360
00:29:56,714 --> 00:29:59,364
He'll stay with us
till tomorrow morning.

361
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:00,764
Your daughter?

362
00:30:02,697 --> 00:30:03,998
My wife.

363
00:30:09,681 --> 00:30:12,115
- Will you now come in?
- Thank you.

364
00:30:20,953 --> 00:30:22,775
Here's your bed.

365
00:30:22,875 --> 00:30:24,900
I'll lift these things.

366
00:30:26,713 --> 00:30:30,222
- Could you sleep there, do you think?
- You try and stop me.

367
00:30:30,322 --> 00:30:31,823
You'll be tired.

368
00:30:33,486 --> 00:30:35,221
I'll say I am.

369
00:30:35,321 --> 00:30:37,657
I'm on the tramp,
looking for a job.

370
00:30:37,757 --> 00:30:40,360
Won't you sit down, please
while I go on with our supper?

371
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:41,760
Oh, thank you.

372
00:31:02,472 --> 00:31:04,105
You've been in these parts long?

373
00:31:04,205 --> 00:31:05,239
 No.

374
00:31:05,339 --> 00:31:07,553
I'm from Glasgow.

375
00:31:07,653 --> 00:31:09,722
- Did you ever see it?
- No.

376
00:31:09,822 --> 00:31:13,917
Oh, you should see Sauchiohall
Street with all its fine shops...

377
00:31:14,017 --> 00:31:16,763
and Argyle Street
on a Saturday night...

378
00:31:16,863 --> 00:31:19,098
with the trams
and the lights...

379
00:31:19,198 --> 00:31:22,498
and the cinema palaces
and their crowd.

380
00:31:22,598 --> 00:31:24,370
It's Saturday night tonight.

381
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:26,961
You certainly don't get
those things out here.

382
00:31:27,061 --> 00:31:28,973
No.

383
00:31:32,411 --> 00:31:33,911
You miss them?

384
00:31:35,054 --> 00:31:36,557
Sometimes.

385
00:31:36,883 --> 00:31:41,079
Well I've never been to Glasgow, but I've
been to Edinburgh and Montreal and London.

386
00:31:41,179 --> 00:31:43,667
I'll tell you all about
London at supper.

387
00:31:43,767 --> 00:31:46,959
- John wouldn't approve of that
I doubt.  - Why not?

388
00:31:47,059 --> 00:31:49,472
He says it's best not
to think of such places

389
00:31:49,572 --> 00:31:51,364
and all the wickedness
that goes on there.

390
00:31:51,464 --> 00:31:54,467
Oh, why not listen now
before he comes back?

391
00:31:54,567 --> 00:31:56,592
What do you want to know?

392
00:31:57,904 --> 00:32:01,067
Well, is it true that all the
ladies paint their toenails?

393
00:32:01,167 --> 00:32:02,505
Some of them.

394
00:32:02,605 --> 00:32:04,825
Do London ladies
look beautiful?

395
00:32:04,925 --> 00:32:08,176
They do. But they wouldn't
if you were beside them.

396
00:32:08,276 --> 00:32:12,296
- You ought not say that.
- What ought he not to say?

397
00:32:12,396 --> 00:32:17,489
I was just saying your wife that I
prefer living in town than the country.

398
00:32:17,589 --> 00:32:19,523
God made the country.

399
00:32:24,363 --> 00:32:26,854
- Is the supper ready, woman?
- Aye.

400
00:32:26,954 --> 00:32:28,879
Do you mind if I have
a look at your paper?

401
00:32:28,979 --> 00:32:31,179
- No, I don't mind.
- Thank you.

402
00:32:48,677 --> 00:32:51,677
- You did not tell me your name.
- Oh, Hammond.

403
00:32:52,456 --> 00:32:55,036
Well, Mr. Hammond, if you'll
put down that paper.

404
00:32:55,136 --> 00:32:57,536
- I'll say a blessing.
- Yes, of course.

405
00:33:02,703 --> 00:33:06,903
Sanctify these bounteous masses
to us miserable sinners.

406
00:33:08,074 --> 00:33:10,201
O Lord, make us
truly thankful...

407
00:33:10,301 --> 00:33:14,301
for them and for all
Thy manifold blessings.

408
00:33:14,821 --> 00:33:17,049
And continually turn our hearts...

409
00:33:17,149 --> 00:33:19,083
from wickedness...

410
00:33:20,172 --> 00:33:22,902
and from worldly things...

411
00:33:24,342 --> 00:33:25,845
unto Thee.

412
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,001
Amen.

413
00:33:35,668 --> 00:33:37,874
I mined, I forgot to lock the barn.

414
00:34:59,251 --> 00:35:02,186
There are cars coming. It'll be
the police, you best be going.

415
00:35:02,286 --> 00:35:04,824
- Thanks, I was having such a grand sleep.
- Hurry, don't let them catch you.

416
00:35:04,924 --> 00:35:07,427
I'm ready. I'll never forget you
for doing this for me.

417
00:35:07,527 --> 00:35:09,714
- Which way do I go?
- I'll show you.

418
00:35:09,814 --> 00:35:11,300
Aye.

419
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,000
I might have known.

420
00:35:13,746 --> 00:35:16,246
Making love behind my back.

421
00:35:19,211 --> 00:35:21,498
- Get out. - Just a minute...
- Aye and you too.

422
00:35:21,598 --> 00:35:23,707
- Get out of my house before I...
- Aye, go. Go.

423
00:35:23,807 --> 00:35:25,090
And leave you like this?
No fair.

424
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:28,185
- It's your chance of liberty.
- Look here, you don't understand.

425
00:35:30,479 --> 00:35:32,518
OK, You're all wrong about this.
She's only trying to help me.

426
00:35:32,618 --> 00:35:34,460
Aye, to bring shame and
disgrace upon my house.

427
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,566
She was helping me to
escape from the police.

428
00:35:37,666 --> 00:35:40,859
- The police? - Yes the police, they're
after me for murder. They're here.

429
00:35:40,959 --> 00:35:44,716
She was only trying to warn me.
I had to tell her about it last night.

430
00:35:44,816 --> 00:35:47,945
Don't let them in. Say I'm not here.
I'll make it worth your while.

431
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:49,145
- How much?
- Five pounds.

432
00:35:49,245 --> 00:35:50,358
- Have you got that much?
- Yes.

433
00:35:50,458 --> 00:35:52,858
- Give it to me.
- After they've gone.

434
00:35:53,659 --> 00:35:56,359
Get back into bed.
Shut him in. Hide him.

435
00:35:58,924 --> 00:36:01,506
- No, not there. I do not trust him.
- But he took the money.

436
00:36:01,606 --> 00:36:03,801
He could not resist it. Here.

437
00:36:05,875 --> 00:36:07,818
What is this in the middle of
the night? What do you want?

438
00:36:07,918 --> 00:36:09,722
Have you seen
a stranger about here?

439
00:36:09,822 --> 00:36:12,242
This kind of a stranger,
I want reward...

440
00:36:12,342 --> 00:36:14,253
I was right.

441
00:36:14,353 --> 00:36:17,653
He's asking if there's a
reward if you get catched.

442
00:36:18,333 --> 00:36:20,853
He'll argue about it for a moment
longer before he lets them in.

443
00:36:20,953 --> 00:36:24,186
Now's your time. Oh, your
jacket's terrible light-colored.

444
00:36:24,286 --> 00:36:27,005
I'm a-feared they'll see you.

445
00:36:27,105 --> 00:36:29,438
- You best take this one.
- Is this your husband's coat?

446
00:36:29,538 --> 00:36:32,838
Aye, his Sunday best one, but
never mind. They must not see you.

447
00:36:32,938 --> 00:36:35,148
- What'll happen to you?
- I'll say I couldn't have stopped you.

448
00:36:35,248 --> 00:36:37,837
- He'll not ill treat you?
- No. He'll pray at me, but no more.

449
00:36:37,937 --> 00:36:39,137
- What's your name?
- Margaret.

450
00:36:39,237 --> 00:36:42,112
Good-bye, Margaret.
I'll never forget you for this.

451
00:37:09,408 --> 00:37:10,911
There he goes!

452
00:37:19,191 --> 00:37:20,591
Spread out in a line.

453
00:38:50,976 --> 00:38:53,052
- Is the master in?
- What name should I say, sir?

454
00:38:53,152 --> 00:38:55,654
Well, he wouldn't know my name.
Ask him if he knows Miss Annabella Smith.

455
00:38:55,754 --> 00:38:58,460
- Would you wait here while I inquire?
- Yes. Go on.

456
00:39:06,465 --> 00:39:07,839
We'd better make inquiries here.

457
00:39:07,939 --> 00:39:10,696
Aye, somebody may have seen
him through the windows.

458
00:39:10,796 --> 00:39:13,249
- There's been a couple of motorcars here.
- Aye.

459
00:39:13,349 --> 00:39:16,374
Murderers do not make calls
in motorcars.

460
00:39:16,474 --> 00:39:18,361
- Good day, dear.
- The same to you.

461
00:39:18,461 --> 00:39:20,752
Have you seen any strangers
about this morning?

462
00:39:20,852 --> 00:39:23,747
There's a few callers upstairs now,
but they're no strangers.

463
00:39:23,847 --> 00:39:27,476
You happen to seen any suspicious-looking
bodies outside the windows or...

464
00:39:27,576 --> 00:39:29,655
- calling at the house?
- No, sir.

465
00:39:29,755 --> 00:39:33,691
There hasn't been anybody near
here for the last half hour.

466
00:39:35,094 --> 00:39:37,594
- You're from Annabella Smith?
- Yes.

467
00:39:38,487 --> 00:39:41,600
We're just having a few drinks to
celebrate my daughter Hillary's birthday.

468
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:44,092
Give me five minutes, to get rid
of these people then we can talk.

469
00:39:44,192 --> 00:39:46,678
- Of course. - Come along in and
meet my wife. Louisa, my dear.

470
00:39:46,778 --> 00:39:49,289
I've another guest for you.
This is Mr...

471
00:39:49,389 --> 00:39:52,132
- I forgot to ask your name.
- Hammond.  - Mr. Hammond.

472
00:39:52,232 --> 00:39:54,780
He's come to see me on business,
all the way from London.

473
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,722
There's a police inspector at the
door sir, he wants to speak to you.

474
00:39:57,822 --> 00:39:59,222
At the door?

475
00:40:01,436 --> 00:40:03,563
All right.
All right, I'll deal with it.

476
00:40:03,663 --> 00:40:06,289
- Take him in, my dear, will you please.
- Come and meet my daughters.

477
00:40:06,389 --> 00:40:09,258
- This is Patricia.
- How do you do?

478
00:40:09,358 --> 00:40:11,264
Mrs. Bailey, Mrs. Hutchins.

479
00:40:11,364 --> 00:40:14,840
Oh, Hilary my dear,
this is Mr. Hammond.

480
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:17,307
- He just arrived from London.
- How do you do, Mr. Hammond?

481
00:40:17,407 --> 00:40:20,973
Forgive the orgy. We've been to church and
the sermon lasted 3 quarters of an hour.

482
00:40:21,073 --> 00:40:23,683
- Oh, this is Captain and Mrs. Ogilvey.
- How do you do?

483
00:40:23,783 --> 00:40:27,683
- Have a drink, Mr. Hammond? - Thank you.
- This is Derek. Derek Stewart.

484
00:40:28,344 --> 00:40:31,323
And this is Sheriff Watson.
You've got to be polite to him.

485
00:40:31,423 --> 00:40:34,277
He's our Sheriff Substitute.
Scotch for local Beak.

486
00:40:34,377 --> 00:40:37,187
He'll give you six months hard
as soon as look at you.

487
00:40:39,611 --> 00:40:42,791
It's all right. Don't worry,
I've sent them away.

488
00:40:42,891 --> 00:40:45,691
Come and look at the view from
this window, Mr. Hammond.

489
00:40:48,932 --> 00:40:50,933
We're rather proud of it.

490
00:40:55,217 --> 00:40:57,584
By the way Sheriff... when you
going to catch that murderer?

491
00:40:57,684 --> 00:40:59,672
- Murderer? What murderer?
- My dear, haven't you heard?…

492
00:40:59,772 --> 00:41:03,100
Why, the man that stuck a carving knife
into that woman in Portland Place last week.

493
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,603
- He's here in the district.
- Darling, how exciting. Where?

494
00:41:05,703 --> 00:41:09,305
Oh, somewhere about. He's been on the
moors, Bridge of Lochay or somewhere.

495
00:41:09,405 --> 00:41:11,357
Sheriff Ames, why don't you catch him?

496
00:41:11,457 --> 00:41:13,966
Wouldn't like me to be stuck in the back
 with a carving knife, would you?

497
00:41:14,066 --> 00:41:17,029
It's no business of mine to catch him.
You catch him, and I'll convict him.

498
00:41:17,129 --> 00:41:21,066
- Is there reward?  - Gracious, it's nearly
1:00. Jim, we must get out of here.

499
00:41:21,166 --> 00:41:23,407
- Professor wants his lunch.
- There's no hurry, my dear.

500
00:41:23,507 --> 00:41:25,927
Still, if you must go, Pat!

501
00:41:26,027 --> 00:41:29,027
- Um, ring for Captain Ogilvey's
car, will you.  - Yes, I will.

502
00:41:30,469 --> 00:41:32,211
Dear, are you coming out?

503
00:41:32,311 --> 00:41:34,315
Come take me in your new car.

504
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:38,368
- Come again another time.
- Good-bye my darling. We'd love to.

505
00:41:38,468 --> 00:41:41,701
Well, whenever you do catch him you'll find me
at the Sheriff's Court at 10 every morning.

506
00:41:41,801 --> 00:41:43,975
- So, bring him along.
- Good-bye Sheriff.

507
00:41:46,658 --> 00:41:48,058
Louisa, my dear.

508
00:41:48,324 --> 00:41:52,924
If you'll excuse us Mr. Hammond and
I want to have a chat before lunch.

509
00:42:00,191 --> 00:42:01,658
Now, Mr. Hannay.

510
00:42:01,758 --> 00:42:05,058
I suppose it's safe to call
you by your real name now.

511
00:42:06,765 --> 00:42:08,492
What about our mutual
friend, Annabella?

512
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:10,229
She's been murdered.

513
00:42:10,329 --> 00:42:11,629
"Murdered"?

514
00:42:12,098 --> 00:42:16,031
Oh, the Portland Mansions affair. What our
friends outside are looking for you for.

515
00:42:16,131 --> 00:42:18,281
- I didn't do it.
- Of course you didn't.

516
00:42:19,691 --> 00:42:22,300
But why come all this way to
Scotland to tell me about it?

517
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,000
I believe she was coming to see you
about some Air Ministry secret.

518
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:29,500
She was killed by a foreign agent
who was interested too.

519
00:42:30,307 --> 00:42:32,833
- She'd tell you what the foreign agent
looked like?  - There wasn't time.

520
00:42:32,933 --> 00:42:35,136
Oh, there was one thing, part of
his little finger was missing.

521
00:42:35,236 --> 00:42:37,507
- Which one?
- This one, I think.

522
00:42:37,952 --> 00:42:40,053
Sure it wasn't...
this one?

523
00:43:01,523 --> 00:43:04,723
- Lunch is ready, dear.
- I'm coming right away.

524
00:43:06,698 --> 00:43:08,738
Well Mr. Hannay.

525
00:43:08,838 --> 00:43:12,437
I'm afraid, I've been guilty of
leading you down the garden path.

526
00:43:12,537 --> 00:43:15,444
Or should it be up?
I never can remember.

527
00:43:15,544 --> 00:43:18,044
It seems to be the wrong
garden, all right.

528
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:21,090
Well.

529
00:43:21,816 --> 00:43:24,543
- What we gonna do about it?
- That's just the point.

530
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:27,043
What are we
going to do about it?

531
00:43:27,769 --> 00:43:30,835
You see, I live here
as a respectable citizen,

532
00:43:30,935 --> 00:43:33,966
and you must realize that my whole
existence would be jeopardized...

533
00:43:34,066 --> 00:43:35,888
if it became known that I'm not...

534
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:39,525
um, what shall we say,
not what I seem.

535
00:43:39,625 --> 00:43:42,491
Oh, Mr. Hannay,
why have you come here?

536
00:43:42,591 --> 00:43:45,691
Why have you forced me
into this difficult position?

537
00:43:46,357 --> 00:43:49,437
I can't lock you up in a room
or anything like that.

538
00:43:49,537 --> 00:43:52,137
You see, there's my wife
and daughters to think of.

539
00:43:52,791 --> 00:43:54,491
I don't know what to think.

540
00:43:54,704 --> 00:43:56,010
Really, I don't.

541
00:43:56,955 --> 00:44:00,305
What makes it doubly important
that I shouldn't let you go is...

542
00:44:00,405 --> 00:44:02,565
That I'm just about to, um...

543
00:44:02,665 --> 00:44:06,165
convey some very vital
information out of the country.

544
00:44:06,937 --> 00:44:08,538
Oh, yes, I've got it.

545
00:44:09,268 --> 00:44:13,074
I'm afraid poor Annabella would
have been too late in any case.

546
00:44:16,830 --> 00:44:18,990
- Well, that's fair.
- Yes.

547
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:21,856
- What about it?
- What about what?  - About yourself.

548
00:44:21,956 --> 00:44:24,956
- Seems to me there's only one way out.
- And what's that?

549
00:44:29,071 --> 00:44:31,585
Supposing I left you alone...

550
00:44:31,685 --> 00:44:33,385
with this revolver?

551
00:44:33,747 --> 00:44:35,631
Tomorrow's newspapers
would be able to announce…

552
00:44:35,731 --> 00:44:38,811
that the Portland Place murderer
had taken his own life.

553
00:44:38,911 --> 00:44:42,427
I thought you were coming to lunch
directly, dear. We've all been waiting.

554
00:44:42,527 --> 00:44:45,527
- Will Mr. Hammond be staying?
- I don't think so, dear.

555
00:44:47,505 --> 00:44:48,905
Well...

556
00:44:49,165 --> 00:44:51,165
what do you think, Mr. Hannay?

557
00:44:58,957 --> 00:45:01,857
Well, I'm afraid you
leave me no alternative.

558
00:45:08,994 --> 00:45:10,694
I cannot find my hymn book.

559
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:13,400
Where did you leave it?

560
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:16,500
In the breast pocket of my overcoat.
It was hanging here.

561
00:45:18,142 --> 00:45:19,342
Johnny...

562
00:45:20,256 --> 00:45:24,162
I'm afraid I gave it to that gentleman
who was staying here that night.

563
00:45:30,585 --> 00:45:33,320
Cigarette cases, yes, but I've never
seen it happen to a hymn book before,

564
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:36,488
- except on the movies.  - And this
bullet stuck among the hymns, eh?

565
00:45:36,588 --> 00:45:38,288
Well, I'm not surprised, Mr. Hannay.

566
00:45:38,388 --> 00:45:40,855
Some of those hymns are
terrible hard to get through.

567
00:45:40,955 --> 00:45:43,421
I've stuck at them
myself before now, eh.

568
00:45:43,521 --> 00:45:46,195
I'm not complaining, Sheriff.
"Hymns that have helped me. "

569
00:45:46,295 --> 00:45:49,415
Yes, that's a good one,
Mr. Hannay. That's fine.

570
00:45:49,515 --> 00:45:51,808
And to think that I was
drinking his champagne...

571
00:45:51,908 --> 00:45:53,341
only half an hour before.

572
00:45:53,441 --> 00:45:55,082
Well, It's a lesson
to us all, Mr. Hannay.

573
00:45:55,182 --> 00:45:57,841
not to mix with doubtful
company on the Sabbath.

574
00:45:57,941 --> 00:45:59,690
And, um... how did you escape?

575
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:01,914
Well, if you look through the
window, sir, you'll see.

576
00:46:02,014 --> 00:46:05,464
They put the... well, the
body in the dressing room.

577
00:46:05,564 --> 00:46:07,457
When I came to, I borrowed
this suit in case...

578
00:46:07,557 --> 00:46:10,257
one of his men recognize me
and pinched this car.

579
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:12,982
Sheriff, I don't want to
hurry you or anything, but…

580
00:46:13,082 --> 00:46:15,420
oughtn't it we take steps?
This is serious, you know.

581
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,555
If it weren't, you don't suppose
I'd put myself in your hands…

582
00:46:17,655 --> 00:46:21,436
- with a murder charge hanging over me.
- Never heed the murder, Mr. Hannay.

583
00:46:21,536 --> 00:46:23,140
I don't doubt you'll
be able to convince…

584
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:26,208
Scotland Yard of your innocence
as easily as you've convinced me.

585
00:46:26,308 --> 00:46:28,809
All I'll need...
will be a short statement...

586
00:46:28,909 --> 00:46:30,940
- that I can forward to the
proper authority. - Oh good.

587
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,548
I've someone coming over from the
police station next door to take it down.

588
00:46:33,648 --> 00:46:34,954
Thank you, sir.

589
00:46:37,302 --> 00:46:39,829
- Are you wishing to see me, Sheriff?
- Indeed, I am.

590
00:46:39,929 --> 00:46:43,529
Do you think I enjoy playing
for time with a murderer?

591
00:46:44,075 --> 00:46:45,714
- "Murderer?"
- Certainly.

592
00:46:45,814 --> 00:46:47,461
Hannay, you're under arrest...

593
00:46:47,561 --> 00:46:50,287
on the charge of willful murder...
of a woman unknown

594
00:46:50,387 --> 00:46:53,573
in Portland Mansions, London on Tuesday
last. Take him over to the county jail.

595
00:46:53,673 --> 00:46:56,455
Sheriff, you heard my story, you must believe
it it's true, and in every word of it.

596
00:46:56,555 --> 00:47:00,326
Hannay, we are not so daft in Scotland
as some smart Londoners may think.

597
00:47:00,426 --> 00:47:02,996
Do you think I believed your
cock-and-bull story about the prof.?

598
00:47:03,096 --> 00:47:05,544
Why, he's my best friend in the
district. Get me Prof. Jordan.

599
00:47:05,644 --> 00:47:07,823
If the prof. didn't shoot me,
where did that bullet come from?

600
00:47:07,923 --> 00:47:10,410
That's easy. From one of
your pursuers on the moor.

601
00:47:10,510 --> 00:47:12,916
- Isn't that so, Inspector?
- It is so sir, I had a shot at him myself.

602
00:47:13,016 --> 00:47:15,576
I demand that you allow me to telephone to
the High Commissioner for Canada in London.

603
00:47:15,676 --> 00:47:17,762
You better do that from London.
You'll be there soon enough.

604
00:47:17,862 --> 00:47:20,482
It'll save you the cost
of a trunk call.

605
00:47:28,632 --> 00:47:30,422
That's the professor's
car, all right.

606
00:47:30,522 --> 00:47:32,825
Hannay must be inside
spilling the beans.

607
00:47:35,225 --> 00:47:36,845
Hey, stop him!

608
00:47:36,945 --> 00:47:38,245
My God!

609
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:32,698
How do you do, how do you do?
We're all waiting for you.

610
00:48:32,798 --> 00:48:36,304
Pamela's gone to meet you
at the station. This way. This way.

611
00:48:37,228 --> 00:48:40,528
...leader and standard-bearer himself.

612
00:48:40,628 --> 00:48:44,400
I welcome this opportunity
of discussing with you...

613
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:49,060
another question vital
to the import of our country...

614
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:52,176
at this critical
and momentous hour.

615
00:48:52,276 --> 00:48:55,347
But first of all,
as a preliminary to this...

616
00:48:55,447 --> 00:48:59,591
- I shall occupy your time...
- You've occupied our much already!

617
00:48:59,691 --> 00:49:01,797
We've had enough of you!

618
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:11,660
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm now going
to call upon the speaker of the evening.

619
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:12,760
Speak up!

620
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:15,207
There's no need for me
to tell you who he is or...

621
00:49:15,307 --> 00:49:18,525
or to speak of his brilliant record
as a soldier and a statesman.

622
00:49:18,625 --> 00:49:20,312
- Son of Scotland who's crossed…
- Speak out!

623
00:49:20,412 --> 00:49:22,239
...the border and conquered England.

624
00:49:22,339 --> 00:49:24,332
He's now one of the
foremost figures in the...

625
00:49:24,432 --> 00:49:28,038
diplomatic political world
in the great city of London.

626
00:49:28,138 --> 00:49:30,088
I'm, therefore, going to ask him
to tell you something…

627
00:49:30,188 --> 00:49:32,724
- That's about time too. - We all were
waiting. - How important it is...

628
00:49:32,824 --> 00:49:36,650
to this constituency that at
this crucial by-election...

629
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:40,921
our candidate should be returned
by an adequate majority.

630
00:49:41,021 --> 00:49:44,021
I now ask for Captain Fraser.

631
00:50:01,987 --> 00:50:05,860
Ladies and gentlemen, I apologize
for my hesitation in rising just now...

632
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:09,686
but to tell you the simple truth I'd
entirely failed while listening to the...

633
00:50:09,786 --> 00:50:12,292
chairman's flattering description
of the next speaker...

634
00:50:12,392 --> 00:50:14,997
to realize he was
talking about me.

635
00:50:17,148 --> 00:50:20,135
As for you, may I say
from the bottom of my heart...

636
00:50:20,235 --> 00:50:22,159
and with the utmost sincerity...

637
00:50:22,259 --> 00:50:24,906
how delighted and relieved
I am to find myself...

638
00:50:25,006 --> 00:50:27,106
in your presence at this moment.

639
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:35,914
Delighted, uh because
of your friendly reception...

640
00:50:36,014 --> 00:50:37,787
uh, relieved because...

641
00:50:37,887 --> 00:50:41,294
so long as I stand on
this platform I'm...

642
00:50:41,394 --> 00:50:44,720
delivered from the mom...
from the cares and the anxieties...

643
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:48,202
which must always be the lot
of a man in my position.

644
00:50:48,302 --> 00:50:50,624
When I journeyed up to Scotland
a few days ago...

645
00:50:50,724 --> 00:50:52,502
traveling on the
Highland Express...

646
00:50:52,602 --> 00:50:55,495
over that magnificent structure
the Forth Bridge that...

647
00:50:55,595 --> 00:50:58,695
monument to Scottish engineering
and Scottish muscle...

648
00:51:00,231 --> 00:51:03,145
That is to say, on that journey
I had no idea that in a few days time...

649
00:51:03,245 --> 00:51:06,767
I should find myself addressing an
important political meeting, no idea.

650
00:51:06,867 --> 00:51:09,787
I'd planned a very different
program for myself.

651
00:51:09,887 --> 00:51:12,103
A very different program.

652
00:51:12,203 --> 00:51:14,107
You'd be for the moors
to shoot something.

653
00:51:14,207 --> 00:51:16,607
Yes, or somebody,
I'm a rotten shot.

654
00:51:17,495 --> 00:51:20,031
Anyhow, I little thought
I should be speaking tonight...

655
00:51:20,131 --> 00:51:23,201
in support of that... that-that
brilliant, young statesman.

656
00:51:23,301 --> 00:51:25,004
That-that rising, um...

657
00:51:25,977 --> 00:51:27,623
The-the-the gentleman on my right...

658
00:51:27,723 --> 00:51:30,308
already known among you
as one destined to make...

659
00:51:30,408 --> 00:51:32,477
no uncertain mark in politics.

660
00:51:32,577 --> 00:51:34,704
In other words, your future
member of Parliament...

661
00:51:34,804 --> 00:51:37,507
your candidate, Mr, uh...

662
00:51:39,244 --> 00:51:40,244
McCrocodile.

663
00:51:40,344 --> 00:51:42,822
Doesn't know the
candidate's name.

664
00:51:42,922 --> 00:51:45,682
I know your candidate will
forgive my referring to him...

665
00:51:45,782 --> 00:51:49,068
by the... the friendly nickname
by which he's already known...

666
00:51:49,168 --> 00:51:52,931
in anticipation...
In anticipation, mark you...

667
00:51:53,031 --> 00:51:54,231
at...

668
00:51:54,518 --> 00:51:55,918
Westminster.

669
00:51:56,539 --> 00:51:59,666
Now, ladies and gentlemen, we'll going to
discuss some topic. What shall it be?

670
00:51:59,766 --> 00:52:01,940
- The herring fisheries!
- Unemployment!

671
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:04,080
- What about the idle rich?
- Idle rich?

672
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:05,867
That's a bit of an old-fashioned
topic these days…

673
00:52:05,967 --> 00:52:09,266
especially for me, because I'm not
rich and I've never been idle.

674
00:52:09,366 --> 00:52:12,457
I've been pretty busy all my life, and I
expect to be much busier quite soon.

675
00:52:12,557 --> 00:52:13,958
Have you ever worked
with your hand?

676
00:52:14,058 --> 00:52:16,858
Indeed I have and I've known
what it is to feel lonely and helpless…

677
00:52:16,958 --> 00:52:18,510
and have the whole world
against me

678
00:52:18,610 --> 00:52:21,283
and those are things that no man
or woman ought to feel.

679
00:52:21,383 --> 00:52:22,794
And I ask your candidate...

680
00:52:22,894 --> 00:52:24,796
and all those who love
their fellowmen...

681
00:52:24,896 --> 00:52:28,566
to set themselves resolutely to make
this world a happier place to live in.

682
00:52:28,666 --> 00:52:31,336
A world where no nation
plots against nation...

683
00:52:31,436 --> 00:52:33,204
where no neighbor
plots against neighbor...

684
00:52:33,304 --> 00:52:35,616
where there is no persecution
or hunting down...

685
00:52:35,716 --> 00:52:38,396
where everybody gets a square deal
and a sporting chance...

686
00:52:38,496 --> 00:52:40,591
and where people try to help
and not to hinder.

687
00:52:40,691 --> 00:52:44,031
A world from which suspicion
and cruelty and fear...

688
00:52:44,131 --> 00:52:45,483
have been forever banished.

689
00:52:45,583 --> 00:52:48,690
That is the sort of world I want!
Is that the sort of world you want?

690
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:50,196
Yes!

691
00:52:50,402 --> 00:52:51,802
Fine!

692
00:52:52,163 --> 00:52:54,763
That's all I have to say.
Good night!

693
00:53:09,511 --> 00:53:11,275
I kept them going
as long as I could for you.

694
00:53:11,375 --> 00:53:14,175
Well, you're certainly
a difficult man to follow.

695
00:53:19,714 --> 00:53:21,679
Well, I suppose you think
you've been damn clever.

696
00:53:21,779 --> 00:53:24,687
- Officer, will you tell your prisoner not to
insult me, please. - You, try and stop me.

697
00:53:24,787 --> 00:53:27,257
- You, come along with me.
- Couldn't you realize I was speaking the truth.

698
00:53:27,357 --> 00:53:30,240
In that railway carriage you
must have seen I was genuine.

699
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:32,843
Well, whether you believe me or not,
will you put a telephone call through…

700
00:53:32,943 --> 00:53:34,616
to the High Commissioner
for Canada in London?

701
00:53:34,716 --> 00:53:37,015
- and tell him an enormously important
secret's… - That'll do now.

702
00:53:37,115 --> 00:53:40,442
An enormously important secret's being taken
out of this country by a foreign agent.

703
00:53:40,542 --> 00:53:43,315
I can't do anything myself because
of this fool of a detective.

704
00:53:43,415 --> 00:53:44,468
Has that penetrated?

705
00:53:44,568 --> 00:53:46,855
Right to the funny bone,
now tell me another one.

706
00:53:46,955 --> 00:53:48,655
Haven't you any sense at all?

707
00:53:48,755 --> 00:53:52,268
Put that call through,
I beg of you and refer them to me!

708
00:53:52,368 --> 00:53:53,768
Will you do this?

709
00:53:53,961 --> 00:53:55,720
No. Good night.

710
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:57,983
I beg pardon, miss, but we
should like you to come too.

711
00:53:58,083 --> 00:54:00,525
- Whatever for?
- To identify the prisoner formally.

712
00:54:00,625 --> 00:54:02,252
- Will you come to the police station?
- What?

713
00:54:02,352 --> 00:54:03,476
It's only for a few minutes.

714
00:54:03,576 --> 00:54:06,576
All right, if it's absolutely
necessary, let's get it over.

715
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,201
Not you.

716
00:54:23,301 --> 00:54:25,623
- Must I sit next to this man?
- It's only for a short time, miss.

717
00:54:25,723 --> 00:54:27,623
Be as quick as you can.

718
00:54:30,868 --> 00:54:32,270
All right.

719
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:44,900
Isn't that the police station?
We're running past it. Tell the man.

720
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,938
I'm afraid, you must have
misunderstood me miss.

721
00:54:47,038 --> 00:54:48,893
We're not exactly going
to this police station.

722
00:54:48,993 --> 00:54:51,276
- Where are we going?
- To Inverary.

723
00:54:51,376 --> 00:54:53,478
- Inverary?
- Yes, miss.

724
00:54:53,578 --> 00:54:55,944
This man is to be questioned
by the Sheriff Principal.

725
00:54:56,044 --> 00:54:59,183
- We have orders to take him there direct.
- But you've no orders to take me.

726
00:54:59,283 --> 00:55:01,211
No, miss, but I'm
afraid you must go.

727
00:55:01,311 --> 00:55:03,488
I'll see you're sent back
the earliest possible moment.

728
00:55:03,588 --> 00:55:05,757
- But, how far is it to Inverary?
- Forty miles.

729
00:55:05,857 --> 00:55:07,459
- Will you keep quiet.
- Sorry.

730
00:55:07,559 --> 00:55:09,297
We'll be there in less
than two hours, miss.

731
00:55:09,397 --> 00:55:13,697
- Two hours, do you think I will spend half
of the night with you all? - Looks like it.

732
00:55:51,012 --> 00:55:53,305
Isn't the man going the wrong way?
That's the way down to the south…

733
00:55:53,405 --> 00:55:54,845
Surely that's the
way to Inverary.

734
00:55:54,945 --> 00:55:57,033
There's a bridge fallen
down on that road, miss.

735
00:55:57,133 --> 00:55:59,838
We shall have to go around.
The man knows the way.

736
00:56:02,886 --> 00:56:04,167
Might I see your warrant?

737
00:56:04,267 --> 00:56:07,667
You shut your mouth. You'll see it soon
enough when we get to the station.

738
00:56:12,790 --> 00:56:15,490
Like to have a small
bet with me, Pamela?

739
00:56:17,479 --> 00:56:19,160
All right, I'll have it
with you, Sherlock.

740
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:21,666
I'll lay you 100 to 1 that
your Sheriff Principal...

741
00:56:21,766 --> 00:56:24,766
has the top joint of his
little finger missing.

742
00:56:25,617 --> 00:56:27,119
What about it?

743
00:56:29,807 --> 00:56:31,111
I win.

744
00:56:32,951 --> 00:56:34,712
Hello, what are we stopping for?

745
00:56:34,812 --> 00:56:37,012
Oh, it's a whole flock of detectives.

746
00:56:41,990 --> 00:56:45,234
Scattered all over the road, damn silly
things. Get out Bugsy and clear them away.

747
00:56:45,334 --> 00:56:48,471
- What about him?
- I'll soon fix that.

748
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:50,168
There, miss. Now you're
a special constable.

749
00:56:50,268 --> 00:56:54,268
- Just what's the idea, what's you doing
this for?  - As long as you stay, he stays.

750
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:58,600
Yes, and as long as I go,
you go. Come on.

751
00:56:59,817 --> 00:57:01,620
Stop them! They got away!

752
00:57:04,856 --> 00:57:05,923
Come on, miss, hurry up.

753
00:57:06,023 --> 00:57:07,723
- I won't!
- Won't?

754
00:57:25,783 --> 00:57:27,583
- You're hurting me.
- Shut up.

755
00:57:28,069 --> 00:57:30,270
See if they've gone down that way.

756
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:44,561
Where the devil
could they have gone?

757
00:58:03,446 --> 00:58:05,602
Help! Help! Help!

758
00:58:05,702 --> 00:58:06,802
Please help!

759
00:58:06,902 --> 00:58:08,202
Let me go!

760
00:58:43,787 --> 00:58:47,487
One yip out of you, and I'll shoot you
first and myself after. I mean that.

761
00:59:06,755 --> 00:59:08,401
There's nobody down
here, I tell you.

762
00:59:08,501 --> 00:59:10,664
Come up here, blast you,
and don't waste any more time.

763
00:59:10,764 --> 00:59:12,367
Spread out and find them.

764
00:59:31,015 --> 00:59:32,915
Must be a mile away by now.

765
00:59:33,991 --> 00:59:35,791
Don't do that.

766
00:59:37,904 --> 00:59:39,704
Oh, do stop whistling.

767
00:59:41,242 --> 00:59:43,272
What are you doing all this for,
you can't possibly escape…

768
00:59:43,372 --> 00:59:46,512
- What chance have you got tied to me?
- Keep that question for your husband.

769
00:59:46,612 --> 00:59:48,806
Meanwhile I'll admit you're
the white man's burden.

770
00:59:48,906 --> 00:59:52,116
I know, and I can't tell you what
comfort that thought gives me.

771
00:59:52,216 --> 00:59:55,549
I say what is the use of this those policemen
will get you as soon as it's daylight.

772
00:59:55,649 --> 00:59:57,059
They may get me,
but they're not policemen.

773
00:59:57,159 --> 00:59:59,267
- And when did you find that out?
- You found that out yourself…

774
00:59:59,367 --> 01:00:02,189
I should never have known
that was the wrong road to Inverary.

775
01:00:02,291 --> 01:00:04,526
They were taking us to their boss,
and God help either you or me…

776
01:00:04,626 --> 01:00:06,586
- if they ever catch us again.
- I see.

777
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:09,899
You're still sticking to your
penny novelette spy story.

778
01:00:09,999 --> 01:00:11,138
Oh!

779
01:00:11,238 --> 01:00:15,166
There are 20 million women in this island,
and I've gotto be chained to you.

780
01:00:15,266 --> 01:00:17,718
Now look here miss, once more,
I'm telling you the truth.

781
01:00:17,818 --> 01:00:18,986
I told it to you once in the…

782
01:00:19,086 --> 01:00:21,687
train, last week. I tried to tell you
after the election meeting, this evening.

783
01:00:21,787 --> 01:00:23,741
I'm telling it you now
for the third time.

784
01:00:23,841 --> 01:00:26,090
There's a dangerous conspiracy
against this island and...

785
01:00:26,190 --> 01:00:27,631
we're the only people
who can stop it.

786
01:00:27,731 --> 01:00:30,181
Think what you've seen happen
right under your very nose.

787
01:00:30,281 --> 01:00:32,523
The gallant knight to the rescue.

788
01:00:32,623 --> 01:00:33,709
All right...

789
01:00:33,809 --> 01:00:36,955
then I'm just a plain,
common murderer...

790
01:00:37,588 --> 01:00:41,628
who stabbed an innocent, defenseless
woman in the back not four days ago.

791
01:00:41,728 --> 01:00:44,295
How do you come out over that?
I don't know how innocent you may be…

792
01:00:44,395 --> 01:00:46,548
but you're a woman, and you're
defenseless, and you're alone…

793
01:00:46,648 --> 01:00:49,700
on a desolate moor in the dark,
manacled to a murderer...

794
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:51,647
who'd stop at nothing
to get you off his hands.

795
01:00:51,747 --> 01:00:54,972
If that's the situation you prefer,
have it, my lovely, and welcome.

796
01:00:55,072 --> 01:00:58,342
I'm not afraid of...

797
01:00:58,442 --> 01:01:01,242
For all you know, I may
murder a woman a week.

798
01:01:04,081 --> 01:01:05,807
So listen to a bit of advice.

799
01:01:05,907 --> 01:01:10,108
From now on do every single thing
I tell you to do, and do it quick.

800
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:12,990
Uh, you big bully.

801
01:01:13,090 --> 01:01:15,752
I like your pluck.
Come on.

802
01:01:24,008 --> 01:01:25,375
- We're going in there.
- What for?

803
01:01:25,475 --> 01:01:26,395
- That's my business.
- But…

804
01:01:26,495 --> 01:01:28,802
Now, remember what I said;
the civil tongue or else.

805
01:01:28,902 --> 01:01:31,869
We're going in there, and you'll going
to back me up in every single thing…

806
01:01:31,969 --> 01:01:35,479
- I say or do. Has that penetrated
the ivory dome? - Only just.

807
01:01:35,579 --> 01:01:37,899
All right, pull yourself together now.
Put your hand in my pocket and…

808
01:01:37,999 --> 01:01:40,499
look as though you're in a hurry.
Come along.

809
01:01:46,178 --> 01:01:48,337
Oh, come away in, then,
come away in, sir.

810
01:01:48,437 --> 01:01:50,007
Oh, the young lady's
terrible wet.

811
01:01:50,107 --> 01:01:52,893
Oh, yes we had an accident
with our car a few miles back.

812
01:01:52,993 --> 01:01:54,872
- You'll be staying the night?
- Yes.

813
01:01:54,972 --> 01:01:57,967
We've just one room left
with one bed in it.

814
01:01:58,067 --> 01:02:01,915
- But you'll not be minding that.
- Oh no-no-no, quite the reverse.

815
01:02:02,015 --> 01:02:04,535
- You're man and wife, I suppose?
- Oh, yes.

816
01:02:04,635 --> 01:02:06,155
Um... yes.

817
01:02:06,255 --> 01:02:09,255
- Have you any luggage?
- No, we left that behind in the car.

818
01:02:09,355 --> 01:02:12,016
Oh, maybe I could lend the
young lady a nightgown.

819
01:02:12,116 --> 01:02:13,569
Will you please to register?

820
01:02:13,669 --> 01:02:15,756
- Um, James, the book.
- Aye, aye.

821
01:02:15,856 --> 01:02:19,109
I'll away up and light the fire for you.
Will you be needing your supper?

822
01:02:19,209 --> 01:02:22,269
Oh, thank you, just send up a large
whiskey and soda and a few sandwiches.

823
01:02:22,369 --> 01:02:25,530
- Oh, and a glass of milk.
- Oh, very well, sir.

824
01:02:25,630 --> 01:02:28,176
Can't write with my left hand,
my dear, but I can shoot with it.

825
01:02:28,276 --> 01:02:30,670
You can guess what's
in this pocket, come on.

826
01:02:30,770 --> 01:02:32,050
Uh, you should sign, darling...

827
01:02:32,150 --> 01:02:35,750
the sooner you get used to writing
your new name, the better.

828
01:02:35,850 --> 01:02:41,450
Off we go. "Mr. and Mrs. Henry Hopkinson,
The Hollyhocks, Hammersmith."

829
01:02:47,554 --> 01:02:50,154
I'll be back in a minute, chaps.

830
01:03:44,696 --> 01:03:48,213
Now deary, off with that wet skirt of yours
and I'll have it dried in the kitchen.

831
01:03:48,313 --> 01:03:50,994
Oh, don't bother it'll… It'll dry
in front of the fire just as well,

832
01:03:51,094 --> 01:03:52,594
thanks all the same.

833
01:03:52,936 --> 01:03:55,649
No doubt the gentleman
will take care of you.

834
01:03:55,749 --> 01:03:57,889
Good night, sir.
Good night, ma'am.

835
01:03:57,989 --> 01:03:59,489
Good night.

836
01:04:01,404 --> 01:04:02,909
Good night.

837
01:04:04,929 --> 01:04:08,399
- Is he married to her, do you think?
- I do not can, and I do not care.

838
01:04:08,499 --> 01:04:10,736
They are so terrible in love
with each other.

839
01:04:10,836 --> 01:04:13,241
I tell you, I can't stand it any longer.
I'm gonna tell them the whole story.

840
01:04:13,341 --> 01:04:14,798
Want to hang me for a murder
I never committed? Go on.

841
01:04:14,898 --> 01:04:17,040
Long as they hang you, I don't
care if you committed it or not.

842
01:04:17,140 --> 01:04:19,220
Let me go! Do you think I'm going to spend
the whole night with you in this room?

843
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:21,807
Of course you are. What else
 can you do? Come on.

844
01:04:21,907 --> 01:04:23,213
Can I come in, sir?

845
01:04:23,313 --> 01:04:24,807
Come here.

846
01:04:27,518 --> 01:04:29,020
Come in.

847
01:04:32,884 --> 01:04:35,444
Oh... We were just getting
warm before the fire.

848
01:04:35,544 --> 01:04:38,670
I can see that. I thought maybe
you'd like this in your bed, sir.

849
01:04:38,770 --> 01:04:41,150
Oh, thank you very much. You'd like a hot
water bottle, wouldn't you, my sweet?

850
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:42,450
Say yes, darling.

851
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:44,440
Yes, darling.

852
01:04:44,540 --> 01:04:47,147
- Very well.
- I say, please don't go.

853
01:04:47,247 --> 01:04:48,939
Why not?

854
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:51,526
Is anything wrong?

855
01:04:51,626 --> 01:04:52,760
Of course there's nothing wrong…

856
01:04:52,860 --> 01:04:55,800
she wants to tell you something,
that's all. We're a runaway couple.

857
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:59,283
I canned it all the time.
And they're after you?

858
01:04:59,383 --> 01:05:01,336
You won't give us away,
will you? Please.

859
01:05:01,436 --> 01:05:03,967
Of course we will
not give you up.

860
01:05:04,067 --> 01:05:06,214
And good night to you both.

861
01:05:06,314 --> 01:05:08,984
- You'll no be disturbed.
- But...

862
01:05:18,743 --> 01:05:21,709
Thank God for a bite to eat.
Come along.

863
01:05:21,809 --> 01:05:23,309
There you are.

864
01:05:27,464 --> 01:05:29,411
Now, what's the next item
on the program?

865
01:05:29,511 --> 01:05:33,011
- Get these things off.
- Right. How we gonna set about it?

866
01:05:33,377 --> 01:05:35,590
Anything in that bag of
yours that will help?

867
01:05:35,690 --> 01:05:38,350
A pair of scissors or
hairpin or something?

868
01:05:38,450 --> 01:05:40,176
There's a nail file here.
Do you think that'd help?

869
01:05:40,276 --> 01:05:42,398
Hm, easily. It'll take about
ten years, but we can try.

870
01:05:42,498 --> 01:05:44,239
Now, let's make ourselves
as comfortable as possible.

871
01:05:44,339 --> 01:05:47,525
What about that skirt of yours?
It's still pretty damp, you know.

872
01:05:47,625 --> 01:05:50,554
I don't want to be tied to a pneumonia
case on top of everything else.

873
01:05:50,654 --> 01:05:53,161
- Take it off, I don't mind.
- I should keep it on, thank you.

874
01:05:53,261 --> 01:05:55,557
And that... is that.

875
01:05:55,657 --> 01:05:57,989
My shoes and stockings are soaked
so I think I'll take them off.

876
01:05:58,089 --> 01:06:00,698
It's the first sensible thing
I've heard you say.

877
01:06:00,798 --> 01:06:03,371
- Can I be of any assistance?
- No, thank you.

878
01:06:03,471 --> 01:06:04,971
Sorry.

879
01:06:13,123 --> 01:06:15,123
- Here, hold this.
- Oh, yes.

880
01:06:26,056 --> 01:06:27,556
Half a minute.

881
01:06:36,749 --> 01:06:38,271
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

882
01:06:38,371 --> 01:06:41,059
- Would you like your milk now?
- No, thank you, I'll wait a little.

883
01:06:41,159 --> 01:06:42,665
All right.

884
01:06:43,340 --> 01:06:44,840
Cheerio.

885
01:06:47,070 --> 01:06:48,518
That's better.

886
01:06:48,618 --> 01:06:50,541
- Are your feet quite warm again?
- Yes, thanks.

887
01:06:50,641 --> 01:06:52,141
Then, come on.

888
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:57,981
Now, will you kindly place yourself
on the operating table?

889
01:06:58,081 --> 01:07:01,255
All right, all right, nobody's gonna
hurt you. This is Armistice Day.

890
01:07:01,355 --> 01:07:03,848
- Let's get some rest while we can.
- I'm not going to lie on this bed.

891
01:07:03,948 --> 01:07:05,808
So long as you're chained to me,
you'll lie wherever I lie.

892
01:07:05,908 --> 01:07:08,266
- We're the Siamese twins.
- Oh, don't gloat.

893
01:07:08,366 --> 01:07:10,612
Gloat? Do you think I'm looking forward
to waking up in the morning…

894
01:07:10,712 --> 01:07:14,118
and seeing your face beside me,
unwashed and shiny?

895
01:07:14,218 --> 01:07:16,171
What a sight you'll be.

896
01:07:16,271 --> 01:07:18,671
Give me that nail file.
Let's have a go at this.

897
01:07:19,229 --> 01:07:20,729
Thank you.

898
01:07:22,421 --> 01:07:25,064
There I go again. I wish I could get
that damn tune out of my head.

899
01:07:25,164 --> 01:07:27,064
I wonder where I heard it.

900
01:07:29,333 --> 01:07:32,667
- You sound very sleepy.
- Sleepy? I'll say so.

901
01:07:32,767 --> 01:07:34,701
Do you know when
I last slept in a bed?

902
01:07:34,801 --> 01:07:38,195
Saturday night, whenever that was.
Then I only got a couple of hours.

903
01:07:38,295 --> 01:07:41,835
- What made you wake so soon? Dreams?
- What do you mean "dreams"?

904
01:07:41,935 --> 01:07:45,282
I've always been told
murderers have terrible dreams.

905
01:07:45,382 --> 01:07:48,529
Oh, but only at first.
Got over that a long time ago.

906
01:07:48,629 --> 01:07:50,954
When I first took to crime,
I was quite squeamish about it.

907
01:07:51,054 --> 01:07:53,254
- I was a most sensitive child.
- You surprised me.

908
01:07:53,354 --> 01:07:55,193
Used to wake up in the middle
of the night screaming,

909
01:07:55,293 --> 01:07:58,796
thinking the police were after me.
But one gets hardened.

910
01:07:58,896 --> 01:08:01,902
- How did you start?
- Oh, quite a small way, like most of us.

911
01:08:02,002 --> 01:08:04,775
Pilfering pennies from other
children's lockers at school.

912
01:08:04,875 --> 01:08:07,575
Then a little pocket picking,
then a spot of car pinching...

913
01:08:07,675 --> 01:08:10,447
then smash and grab and
so on to plain burglary.

914
01:08:10,547 --> 01:08:12,747
Killed my first man
when I was 19.

915
01:08:15,539 --> 01:08:18,192
Then in years to come, you'll be able
to take your grandchildren...

916
01:08:18,292 --> 01:08:20,501
to Madame Tussaud's
and point me out.

917
01:08:20,601 --> 01:08:21,605
Which section?

918
01:08:21,705 --> 01:08:24,534
Oh, it's early to say.
I'm still young.

919
01:08:24,634 --> 01:08:27,410
But I'll be there, all right,
in one department or another.

920
01:08:27,510 --> 01:08:30,661
Yes, you'll point me out and say,
"Chicks, if I were to tell you...

921
01:08:30,761 --> 01:08:34,781
how matey I once was with that gentleman,
you'd be s..." What's the matter?

922
01:08:34,881 --> 01:08:36,920
You're... pinching my wrist
with these handcuffs.

923
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:38,796
Oh, sorry.

924
01:08:38,896 --> 01:08:40,982
Talking of Madame Tussaud's,
that's how it all began.

925
01:08:41,082 --> 01:08:43,426
- What began?
- My career of crime.

926
01:08:43,526 --> 01:08:46,216
All hereditary.
Great Uncle Penruddock.

927
01:08:46,316 --> 01:08:47,383
Who was he?

928
01:08:47,483 --> 01:08:49,413
My good girl, where
were you brought up?

929
01:08:49,513 --> 01:08:51,460
Never heard of my
Great Uncle Penruddock,

930
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:53,853
Cornish Bluebeard?
Got it all from him.

931
01:08:53,953 --> 01:08:56,159
I thought your family
came from Canada.

932
01:08:56,259 --> 01:08:59,356
No, that's where they went.
After the Penruddock incident.

933
01:08:59,456 --> 01:09:01,809
Yes, he murdered three wives
and got away with it,

934
01:09:01,909 --> 01:09:05,808
but his third mother-in-law got the goods
on him and tried to have him arrested.

935
01:09:05,908 --> 01:09:09,599
Did she succeed? No.
He was too quick for her.

936
01:09:09,699 --> 01:09:13,799
Took her for a walk to Land's End and
shoved her over into the Atlantic Ocean.

937
01:09:15,052 --> 01:09:18,925
He's in Madame Tussaud's, all right,
and there's no doubt about his department.

938
01:09:19,025 --> 01:09:20,931
You must go down and
see him sometime.

939
01:09:21,031 --> 01:09:22,384
Can't mistake him.

940
01:09:22,484 --> 01:09:26,084
Third on the left as you go in.
Red whiskers and a harelip.

941
01:09:27,264 --> 01:09:30,764
And that, lady, is the
sad story of my life.

942
01:09:30,994 --> 01:09:33,994
Poor orphan boy
who never had a chance.

943
01:09:34,704 --> 01:09:37,904
Are you still set on
giving me up to the police?

944
01:09:57,648 --> 01:09:59,627
You're sure everything's
going to be quite all right?

945
01:09:59,727 --> 01:10:02,192
Bound to be.
He can't have much time.

946
01:10:02,292 --> 01:10:04,239
As soon as I've picked up...

947
01:10:04,339 --> 01:10:06,657
you know what,
I'll clear out of the country.

948
01:10:06,757 --> 01:10:08,665
Be careful.

949
01:10:08,765 --> 01:10:10,265
Wire to me.

950
01:10:15,972 --> 01:10:18,372
- Good-bye, my dear.
- Good-bye.

951
01:12:44,465 --> 01:12:46,765
Is that Professor
Jordan's house?

952
01:12:47,238 --> 01:12:49,338
Can I speak to Mrs. Jordan then?

953
01:12:51,006 --> 01:12:52,706
Is that Mrs. Jordan?

954
01:12:54,997 --> 01:12:57,044
Oh, he's gone to London
already, has he?

955
01:12:57,144 --> 01:12:59,028
If you can manage it,
I'd like that whiskey hot.

956
01:12:59,128 --> 01:13:00,851
I-I'll away and get
the hot water.

957
01:13:00,951 --> 01:13:03,664
No, he ducked down the side street,
the police went the wrong way.

958
01:13:03,764 --> 01:13:06,937
The girl handed him over to us,
thinking we were detectives.

959
01:13:07,037 --> 01:13:09,937
We had to take her as well
because he told her everything.

960
01:13:11,808 --> 01:13:13,808
Very good, ma'am. I see.

961
01:13:13,908 --> 01:13:15,208
Yes, ma'am.

962
01:13:17,348 --> 01:13:18,448
Well?

963
01:13:18,548 --> 01:13:21,160
The old man's got the wind up.
He's cleared out already.

964
01:13:21,260 --> 01:13:22,354
Whatever for?

965
01:13:22,454 --> 01:13:25,252
He thought it too dangerous
with Hannay on the loose.

966
01:13:25,352 --> 01:13:27,398
He's warning the whole 39 Steps.

967
01:13:27,498 --> 01:13:29,258
Has he got the...

968
01:13:29,358 --> 01:13:30,564
- you know?
- Yes.

969
01:13:30,664 --> 01:13:33,763
He's picking up our friend at the
London Palladium on the way out.

970
01:13:33,863 --> 01:13:35,383
Here's your toddy.

971
01:13:35,483 --> 01:13:37,307
That'll be half a crown.

972
01:13:37,407 --> 01:13:40,407
- And the phone call?
- Uh, we'll say a schilling.

973
01:13:46,290 --> 01:13:47,303
Is...

974
01:13:47,403 --> 01:13:49,616
- Is this a hotel as well?
- Aye.

975
01:13:49,716 --> 01:13:52,649
- I mean, do you have people
staying here?  - Aye.

976
01:13:52,749 --> 01:13:56,455
- I suppose, you get a few odd people
at this time of year?  - Aye.

977
01:13:57,227 --> 01:14:00,447
- You didn't happen to have anyone
in tonight, did you? - Aye.

978
01:14:00,547 --> 01:14:01,647
They...

979
01:14:01,747 --> 01:14:04,134
They weren't by any chance
a young couple, were they?

980
01:14:04,234 --> 01:14:05,701
James!

981
01:14:05,801 --> 01:14:07,534
Mercy me!

982
01:14:07,634 --> 01:14:10,300
What kind of a silly creature
am I married to?

983
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:12,309
Do you want to get us all jailed?

984
01:14:12,409 --> 01:14:15,409
- How much did you take for these?
- Half a crown.

985
01:14:18,843 --> 01:14:20,748
Out, the pair of you!

986
01:14:20,848 --> 01:14:24,340
And do not let on to anybody
that you got to drink here after hours.

987
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:25,740
Ohh!

988
01:14:35,125 --> 01:14:39,925
You old fool, you. You wouldn't have
give away a young couple, would you?

989
01:16:29,157 --> 01:16:30,657
Good morning.

990
01:16:33,590 --> 01:16:34,810
What's the idea?

991
01:16:34,910 --> 01:16:36,152
How did we get out of these?

992
01:16:36,252 --> 01:16:38,938
We didn't at least you didn't.
I slipped out of mine last night and…

993
01:16:39,038 --> 01:16:40,717
came and camped out here.

994
01:16:40,817 --> 01:16:44,117
- Why didn't you run away?
- I did, but just as I was going I...

995
01:16:44,772 --> 01:16:47,257
I discovered that you've
been speaking the truth.

996
01:16:47,357 --> 01:16:49,689
So I decided to stay.

997
01:16:49,789 --> 01:16:52,944
May I ask what earthquake caused
your brain to work at last?

998
01:16:53,044 --> 01:16:55,542
Those two men were in here last night,
I overheard them telephoning.

999
01:16:55,642 --> 01:16:57,622
- What did they say?
- Oh...

1000
01:16:57,722 --> 01:16:59,096
A lot of stuff about...

1001
01:16:59,196 --> 01:17:00,337
about the 39 Steps.

1002
01:17:00,437 --> 01:17:03,073
- The thirty… You really…
- What? - No, go on. Go on.

1003
01:17:03,173 --> 01:17:04,626
Someone's going to warn them.

1004
01:17:04,726 --> 01:17:06,839
- How can you warn steps?
- Never mind. Go on.

1005
01:17:06,939 --> 01:17:08,584
Oh, yes-yes, and there
was another thing.

1006
01:17:08,684 --> 01:17:12,540
Someone got scared
and is clearing out and ehm...

1007
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:13,640
Oh, yes-yes, I know,

1008
01:17:13,740 --> 01:17:15,780
and is picking up someone
at the London Palladium.

1009
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:18,080
London Palladium?
What the devil?

1010
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:20,407
Is that the professor?

1011
01:17:20,507 --> 01:17:22,559
Our friend with the
little finger missing?

1012
01:17:22,659 --> 01:17:24,659
What does he want to
go there for?

1013
01:17:29,091 --> 01:17:31,665
I feel such a fool,
not having believed you.

1014
01:17:31,765 --> 01:17:33,699
Oh, that's all right.

1015
01:17:36,184 --> 01:17:39,449
Well, we... we-we-we
we ought to get a move on.

1016
01:17:39,549 --> 01:17:41,322
What room are those two men in?

1017
01:17:41,422 --> 01:17:44,622
No room, they... they went
as soon as they telephoned.

1018
01:17:45,795 --> 01:17:47,295
They what?

1019
01:17:48,219 --> 01:17:49,219
Didn't I tell you?

1020
01:17:49,319 --> 01:17:51,970
You let them go after hearing
what they said? You...

1021
01:17:52,070 --> 01:17:54,558
- You button-headed little idiot.
- Don't talk to me like that!

1022
01:17:54,658 --> 01:17:57,824
Four or five precious hours wasted!
Why didn't you wake me up at once?

1023
01:17:57,924 --> 01:18:00,177
Even you might have realized that
what they said was important.

1024
01:18:00,277 --> 01:18:02,177
Now they call these men off.
Why not let well alone?

1025
01:18:02,277 --> 01:18:04,981
Let well alone? My good girl,
I'm accused of murder!

1026
01:18:05,081 --> 01:18:08,298
Can't you realize the only way I can
clear myself is to expose these spies?

1027
01:18:08,398 --> 01:18:10,578
You still can. The man's
going to the London Palladium.

1028
01:18:10,678 --> 01:18:13,663
Really? First or second house?
I'll get there five hours late!

1029
01:18:13,763 --> 01:18:15,369
Fine! The show will
just about suit you.

1030
01:18:15,469 --> 01:18:17,769
- What's that?
- Crazy Month!

1031
01:18:38,181 --> 01:18:40,514
You're quite right, madame.

1032
01:18:40,614 --> 01:18:42,948
It's true the Air Ministry
has got a new thing...

1033
01:18:43,048 --> 01:18:45,401
quite a lot of people
are interested in.

1034
01:18:45,501 --> 01:18:48,687
But they are positive that no
papers are missing about it...

1035
01:18:48,787 --> 01:18:50,593
that would be of
any use to a spy.

1036
01:18:50,693 --> 01:18:52,522
But I tell you I'm quite
certain about it.

1037
01:18:52,622 --> 01:18:54,765
There's a man leaving the country
 tonight with something.

1038
01:18:54,865 --> 01:18:57,398
Since you phoned to us
from Scotland this morning...

1039
01:18:57,498 --> 01:19:00,198
we've made the
minutest inquiries.

1040
01:19:06,528 --> 01:19:10,175
- It's obvious I'm wasting my time here.
- Now, just a moment, miss, please.

1041
01:19:10,275 --> 01:19:12,539
Um, there's one thing
you haven't told us.

1042
01:19:13,454 --> 01:19:15,054
Where's Richard Hannay?

1043
01:19:18,133 --> 01:19:20,368
I haven't the faintest idea.

1044
01:19:20,468 --> 01:19:22,289
Now, look here, miss,
you can't...

1045
01:19:22,389 --> 01:19:25,031
- You're in the telephone book,
aren't you?  - Yes.

1046
01:19:25,131 --> 01:19:27,565
Well, if anything crops up,
we'll give you a ring.

1047
01:19:27,665 --> 01:19:28,998
That'll be all now.

1048
01:19:29,098 --> 01:19:30,798
Thank you.

1049
01:19:35,537 --> 01:19:39,267
Tell Archer and Seagrave to get
another taxi and follow that girl.

1050
01:19:39,367 --> 01:19:41,467
She'll lead us to
Hannay, all right.

1051
01:20:08,156 --> 01:20:12,354
Love is a flower that blooms.

1052
01:20:23,838 --> 01:20:24,945
Cover every exit,

1053
01:20:25,045 --> 01:20:27,301
and on no account let
anyone leave the building.

1054
01:20:27,401 --> 01:20:29,347
Now, you two men go
in the orchestra pit.

1055
01:20:29,447 --> 01:20:31,294
Ladies and gentlemen,

1056
01:20:31,394 --> 01:20:32,886
we shall now...

1057
01:20:32,986 --> 01:20:34,486
sing.

1058
01:20:52,716 --> 01:20:55,316
Go on. Move along
there, please.

1059
01:20:55,416 --> 01:20:56,816
Go on, sir.

1060
01:20:58,849 --> 01:21:00,703
Sorry sir, but no one's allowed
to leave the theater.

1061
01:21:00,803 --> 01:21:02,911
What was the great idea, can't a
mate go out and have a drink?

1062
01:21:03,011 --> 01:21:05,551
- Ticket, please. - I got a seat withhold
that I'm just looking for, sir…

1063
01:21:05,651 --> 01:21:08,451
- can I go through, please?
- Oh, very good.

1064
01:21:35,316 --> 01:21:39,416
She's seen him. She's on her way
down to the stalls, perhaps.

1065
01:22:07,692 --> 01:22:10,892
May I borrow your opera glasses,
please? Thank you.

1066
01:22:15,675 --> 01:22:18,575
Excuse me.
May I take your place, please?

1067
01:22:18,964 --> 01:22:21,572
What are you doing here?
Listen, I found him. He's up in that box.

1068
01:22:21,672 --> 01:22:23,996
You can't do anything about it.
I've been to Scotland Yard.

1069
01:22:24,096 --> 01:22:26,750
Nothing had ever's been stolen from the Air
Ministry, they're absolutely certain about it.

1070
01:22:26,850 --> 01:22:29,751
But, you heard those men say
he'd gone and there he is.

1071
01:22:31,664 --> 01:22:34,764
Shall we take him now, sir
or wait till the interval?

1072
01:22:36,203 --> 01:22:39,803
What you going to do? There's
nothing missing. There's an end to it.

1073
01:22:51,713 --> 01:22:52,818
Hear that tune?

1074
01:22:52,918 --> 01:22:55,973
It's that damn thing I couldn't
get out of my head.

1075
01:22:56,073 --> 01:22:59,440
Now I know where I heard it before,
of course, that music hall.

1076
01:22:59,540 --> 01:23:01,140
Annabella's...

1077
01:23:03,171 --> 01:23:05,435
Ladies and gentlemen...

1078
01:23:05,535 --> 01:23:08,282
with your kind attention
and permission...

1079
01:23:08,382 --> 01:23:11,408
I have now the honor
to present to you...

1080
01:23:11,508 --> 01:23:14,321
one of the most remarkable
men in the world.

1081
01:23:14,421 --> 01:23:18,093
- That same little man.
- Every day he commits to memory...

1082
01:23:18,193 --> 01:23:19,880
50 new facts,

1083
01:23:19,980 --> 01:23:22,680
and remembers
every one of them.

1084
01:23:23,046 --> 01:23:25,859
Facts from history,
from geography...

1085
01:23:25,959 --> 01:23:29,552
from newspapers,
from scientific textbooks...

1086
01:23:29,652 --> 01:23:31,732
millions and millions of them...

1087
01:23:31,832 --> 01:23:34,489
down to the smallest detail.

1088
01:23:34,589 --> 01:23:37,728
Test him, ladies and gentlemen.
Ask him any question...

1089
01:23:37,828 --> 01:23:40,368
I've got it! I've got it!
Of course there are no papers missing.

1090
01:23:40,468 --> 01:23:42,730
All the information's
inside Memory's head.

1091
01:23:42,830 --> 01:23:44,776
Mr. Memory.

1092
01:23:44,876 --> 01:23:47,136
- But I still don't understand.
- Don't you see?

1093
01:23:47,236 --> 01:23:49,476
The details of that Air Ministry
secret were borrowed,

1094
01:23:49,576 --> 01:23:51,462
memorized by this little man...

1095
01:23:51,562 --> 01:23:53,408
and then replaced before
anyone could find out.

1096
01:23:53,508 --> 01:23:56,912
That's why he's here tonight: to take
Memory out of the country after the show.

1097
01:23:57,012 --> 01:24:00,758
- But, surely...  - Some gentlemen
here would like to speak to you.

1098
01:24:00,858 --> 01:24:02,578
Question, please.

1099
01:24:02,678 --> 01:24:03,684
Question, please.

1100
01:24:03,784 --> 01:24:06,961
- When's the boat race?
- When did Florence Nightingale die?

1101
01:24:07,061 --> 01:24:09,256
- What is the height of the Empire State?…
- Are you Richard Hannay?

1102
01:24:09,356 --> 01:24:11,381
- Listen, there's something you ought to know.
- …Hannay, come along quietly.

1103
01:24:11,481 --> 01:24:13,694
- Yes, but look here, that man on the stage…
- I don't care. Now you don't wanna cause…

1104
01:24:13,794 --> 01:24:16,908
- any trouble, spoil people's entertainment.
- What was the date on General Gordon's death?

1105
01:24:17,008 --> 01:24:20,008
- Where's the capital of M...
- What are the 39 Steps?

1106
01:24:21,209 --> 01:24:24,811
Come on, answer up!
What are the 39 Steps?

1107
01:24:24,911 --> 01:24:26,364
The 39 Steps...

1108
01:24:26,464 --> 01:24:28,703
is an organization of spies...

1109
01:24:28,803 --> 01:24:32,103
collecting information on behalf
of the foreign office of...

1110
01:24:56,023 --> 01:24:59,658
Please! Keep your seats!
Keep your seats, please!

1111
01:24:59,758 --> 01:25:02,658
There is no need for alarm,
no cause for alarm.

1112
01:25:03,257 --> 01:25:05,271
- Oh, I'm all right, yes.
- Sure you are.

1113
01:25:05,371 --> 01:25:07,031
I don't want a chair, no.
No way.

1114
01:25:07,131 --> 01:25:10,879
- Well, let me rest here. I'm all right.
- Take it easy. Take it easy now.

1115
01:25:10,979 --> 01:25:12,191
Take it easy.

1116
01:25:12,291 --> 01:25:13,707
I'm all right.

1117
01:25:13,807 --> 01:25:16,207
Get the girls on straightaway!

1118
01:25:17,671 --> 01:25:19,437
The girls' introduction right away.

1119
01:25:19,537 --> 01:25:20,737
Mr. Memory,

1120
01:25:20,837 --> 01:25:24,637
what was the secret formula
you were taking out of the country?

1121
01:25:26,193 --> 01:25:28,559
Would it be all right,
me telling you, sir?

1122
01:25:28,659 --> 01:25:30,287
It was a big job to learn it...

1123
01:25:30,387 --> 01:25:32,474
the biggest job I ever tackled...

1124
01:25:32,574 --> 01:25:35,755
- and I don't want to throw it all away.
- It'll be quite all right.

1125
01:25:35,855 --> 01:25:37,660
The first feature
of the new engine is...

1126
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:39,881
its greatly increased ratio
of compression...

1127
01:25:39,981 --> 01:25:43,517
represented by R minus 1 over R
to the power of gamma...

1128
01:25:43,617 --> 01:25:47,724
where R represents the ratio
of compression and gamma...

1129
01:25:47,824 --> 01:25:49,817
seen in end elevation.

1130
01:25:49,917 --> 01:25:52,784
The axis of the two
lines of cylinders...

1131
01:25:52,884 --> 01:25:56,043
angle of 65 degrees.

1132
01:25:56,143 --> 01:25:59,243
Dimensions of cylinders
as follows...

1133
01:26:00,300 --> 01:26:05,099
This device renders the engine
completely silent.

1134
01:26:05,199 --> 01:26:07,052
Am I right, sir?

1135
01:26:07,152 --> 01:26:08,966
Quite right, old chap.

1136
01:26:09,066 --> 01:26:12,297
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

1137
01:26:12,397 --> 01:26:15,087
I'm glad it's off my mind,

1138
01:26:15,187 --> 01:26:16,887
at last.
