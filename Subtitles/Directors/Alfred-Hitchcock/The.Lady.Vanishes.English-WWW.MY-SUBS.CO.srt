- What do you mean?

00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:55,421
- Never mind. Do you talk the lingo?
- No.

481
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:58,048
Well, they probably thought
you were trying to borrow some money.

Come on. Let's knock the idea
out of their stupid heads.

483
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,178
A most unfortunate remark.

I say. Excuse me. I think there's been
a little misunderstanding.

- Yes. I have heard.

- This gentleman has been explaining to me.
- Ah.

489
00:37:18,278 --> 00:37:22,948

- 1934 class.

492
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:32,249
- Ah.
- Sì. And the lady in the corner
is the Baroness Atona.

493
00:37:32,334 --> 00:37:34,251
Oh, yes. I met her husband.

494
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:37,004
He presented prizes at the folk dance festival.
Minister of propaganda.

You may have heard of me.

- Yes. The same.

497
00:37:42,302 --> 00:37:45,679
You flew over to England the other day
and operated on one of our cabinet ministers.

498
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:48,140
- Oh, yes.
- Tell me. Did you find anything?

499
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:51,518
- A slight cerebral contusion.
- Oh, well, that's better than nothing.

500
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:55,773
But I am picking up a similar case at the next
station, but so much more complicated.

501

a cranial fracture with compression.

But that's not true.
She was sitting where you are.

- Can you describe her?
- Well, it's a bit difficult.

513

You see, she was
sort of middle-aged and ordinary.

- Tweeds, oatmeal flecked with brown...

There was an Englishman who passed the sugar.

If we can find someone who saw her,
we'll have the place searched.

- That's the gentleman.

She's back there kicking up a devil of a fuss.

- Well, she hasn't been in here, old man.

- How?

551

I was having tea about an hour ago with
an English lady. You saw her, didn't you?

00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:40,479
- I don't know. I mean, definitely.
I was talking to my friend. Wasn't I?
- Indubitably.

553
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:44,483
But you were sitting at the next table. She turned
and borrowed the sugar. You must remember.

- I recall passing the sugar.
- Then you saw her.

00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:49,154
I repeat. We were deep in conversation.
We were discussing cricket.

00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:52,116
I don't see how a thing like cricket
can make you forget seeing people.

Oh, don't you? If that's your attitude, obviously
there's nothing more to be said. Come, Caldicott.

00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:58,080
- "A thing like cricket."
- Hmm.

we were looking for a lost cricket ball.

There never was a Miss Froy.

- We're going to have the train searched.

634
00:45:32,605 --> 00:45:35,649
- You'll have to think of a fresh theory now, Doctor.
- It is not necessary.

635
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:38,402
My theory was a perfectly good one.
The facts were misleading.

636

I hope you will find your friend.
Excuse me.

- Right you are. Come along.

Eric.

639
00:45:52,208 --> 00:45:55,627
I was only going to mention that I told
that girl I'd seen her friend.

640

What's that?
Have you taken leave of your senses?

- On the contrary, I've come to them.
- What do you mean?

642
00:46:01,509 --> 00:46:03,760
If there's a scandal,
there'd be a divorce.

You couldn't let me down, could you?

644
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:09,307
You'd have to do the decent thing
as reluctantly as only you know how.

You forget one
very important thing, Margaret.

646
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:14,396
Your husband would divorce you.
I've no doubt.

647

my wife will never divorce me.

- Miss Froy.

That isn't Miss Froy.

- No.

I say, it's a silly thing to say,
but are you Miss Froy?

659

But she wasn't the lady I saw.
It was Miss Froy.

Everything's the same, but it isn't her.

00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:18,960
I beg your pardon.
When did you say you first met this Miss Froy?

668
00:47:19,045 --> 00:47:22,547
- Last night at the hotel.
- Oh. And was she wearing a costume like this?

669
00:47:22,632 --> 00:47:24,966
- Yes. I think so.
- Then I must apologize.

670
00:47:25,051 --> 00:47:27,010
- You did meet her after all.
- Then -

671
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:29,554
But not on this train.
In your subconscious mind...

672
00:47:29,639 --> 00:47:32,307
you substituted for the face
of Madame Kummer that of Miss Froy.

673
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:35,227
But I didn't. I couldn't have, I tell you.
I talked to her here.

674
00:47:35,311 --> 00:47:38,230
That's very easily settled.
There's an Englishwoman who said she saw her.

is this the woman you saw?

You only did it to save your own skin.

She was lying. I saw it in her face.
They're all lying, but why? Why?

Now, why don't you sit down
and take it easy?

Do you believe this nonsense about substituting
Miss Froy's face for Madame Kummer's?

Well, I think any change
would be an improvement.

she was, and nothing will convince me otherwise.

I never saw Miss Froy on the train.

- It didn't happen. I know now.
- I'm glad you're gonna take it like that.

- No, wrong. Double scotch.

- A million Mexicans drink it.
- Maybe they do, but Father didn't.

- Packet of what?

a very remarkable man.

- Incessantly.

In fact, he never put it down, unless, uh -
unless it became absolutely necessary.

his love of music.

in the dining car. Mine will be Chartreuse.

Have you ever actually seen your patient?

No, I merely received a message
to pick the case up and operate at Morsken.

- We believe there's been a substitution, Doctor.

963

close to where the accident occurred.

contained a quantity of Hydrocin.

1023

For your benefit, Hydrocin
is a very little-known drug...

1024
01:11:18,858 --> 01:11:22,027
which has the effect, in a small quantity,
of paralyzing the brain...

and rendering the victim unconscious
for a considerable period.
