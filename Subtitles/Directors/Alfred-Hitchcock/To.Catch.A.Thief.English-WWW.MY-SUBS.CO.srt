1
00:01:52,397 --> 00:01:55,065
My jewels! My jewels!

2
00:01:55,149 --> 00:01:58,235
I've been robbed!
Someone stole my jewels!

3
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:01,113
Help! Help! Police!

4
00:02:18,923 --> 00:02:23,802
My diamonds! My diamonds!
They're gone! Help!

5
00:05:39,957 --> 00:05:41,625
- Lepic.
- Mercier.

6
00:05:42,877 --> 00:05:45,295
Monsieur Robie,
we represent the Sûreté.

7
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:46,922
We are making some inquiries

8
00:05:47,006 --> 00:05:49,466
in reference
to a number of jewel robberies.

9
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:52,802
We have reason to believe that
you could provide us with information

10
00:05:52,887 --> 00:05:55,347
that would help us in our investigations.

11
00:05:55,473 --> 00:05:59,309
Would you be good enough
to accompany us to our office in Nice?

12
00:06:08,986 --> 00:06:12,239
All right, but would you mind
if I put on something more formal?

13
00:11:38,732 --> 00:11:40,066
Okay.

14
00:11:40,818 --> 00:11:42,193
You left in a hurry?

15
00:11:42,486 --> 00:11:44,988
- They came for me an hour ago.
- The police?

16
00:11:45,072 --> 00:11:48,491
- Five of them.
- Naturally, you are innocent.

17
00:11:49,201 --> 00:11:52,161
I haven't stolen a piece of jewelry
in 15 years.

18
00:11:52,246 --> 00:11:55,623
- Honesty.
- Well, it has a good feeling.

19
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:59,294
What do you think of my kitchen?
Works like a machine, yes?

20
00:11:59,378 --> 00:12:01,462
- Bertani...
- Just like our little band

21
00:12:01,547 --> 00:12:06,843
in the Underground during the war.
Cutting, slicing, just like the old days.

22
00:12:07,344 --> 00:12:09,679
They think I'm responsible
for these robberies, don't they?

23
00:12:09,763 --> 00:12:12,348
Well, once they were all in prison
with you.

24
00:12:12,433 --> 00:12:15,143
I know. And now if there's
any crime on the Riviera,

25
00:12:15,227 --> 00:12:17,103
we're the first to be suspected
by the police.

26
00:12:17,187 --> 00:12:20,481
But since the war, I have obliged
all these men to be honest.

27
00:12:20,566 --> 00:12:22,734
I have beat honesty into their skulls.

28
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,862
I did not want them to break
their paroles and return to prison.

29
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:28,990
Listen, if my parole is broken,
they'll throw away the key.

30
00:12:29,074 --> 00:12:31,993
I came here for one reason,
to tell these men and you

31
00:12:32,077 --> 00:12:33,995
that I had nothing to do
with the robberies.

32
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,539
Perhaps I believe you,
but your comrades

33
00:12:36,624 --> 00:12:40,501
are very angry with you, Robie.
They think you let them down.

34
00:12:40,586 --> 00:12:42,712
So long, Bertani.
I wouldn't put it past any of them

35
00:12:42,796 --> 00:12:44,839
to be doing the robberies themselves.

36
00:12:44,923 --> 00:12:48,384
Simple men without education?
No, Robie.

37
00:12:49,595 --> 00:12:51,137
Excuse me. Business calls.

38
00:12:51,764 --> 00:12:53,222
Don't go.

39
00:13:49,613 --> 00:13:52,657
But, you know,
coincidence can be terrible.

40
00:13:52,783 --> 00:13:56,953
These robberies all bear your mark,
but you claim to be innocent.

41
00:13:57,037 --> 00:13:59,372
I do more than claim. I insist.

42
00:14:02,584 --> 00:14:06,337
What I can't understand is how
this thief could imitate me so perfectly.

43
00:14:06,463 --> 00:14:10,216
It has to be someone
who knew every detail of my technique.

44
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,301
Maybe somebody in the police.

45
00:14:15,305 --> 00:14:18,433
He picks perfect victims
with only the right stones.

46
00:14:18,517 --> 00:14:21,269
Goes up walls, over the roofs,
down through the skylights,

47
00:14:21,353 --> 00:14:23,771
leaves no clue
and then disappears in the night.

48
00:14:23,856 --> 00:14:25,940
Just like John Robie, the Cat.

49
00:14:26,024 --> 00:14:27,775
You don't believe me
any more than the rest.

50
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:30,153
He's as nervous as a cat.

51
00:14:30,487 --> 00:14:33,823
If somebody caught this imitator,
we'd all be off the hook, wouldn't we?

52
00:14:33,949 --> 00:14:35,658
- Surely.
- Well, no one believes me,

53
00:14:35,784 --> 00:14:38,077
but the police
are chasing the wrong man.

54
00:14:38,162 --> 00:14:40,204
Someone's got to start
chasing the right one.

55
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:42,331
One day he'll make a mistake.

56
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:45,501
Bertani, there's only one answer,
and I should have seen it sooner.

57
00:14:45,627 --> 00:14:50,339
- I've got to catch this imitator myself.
- You couldn't do more than the police.

58
00:14:50,466 --> 00:14:53,426
But I could,
and I'm the only one who could,

59
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:56,554
because I can anticipate him,
try to figure out his next move,

60
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,139
and then get there ahead of him

61
00:14:58,223 --> 00:15:00,558
and catch him
with his hand right in the jewel case.

62
00:15:00,684 --> 00:15:03,519
If they catch you,
nobody will believe what you say.

63
00:15:03,645 --> 00:15:07,648
Who believes me now?
The biggest problem is time.

64
00:15:07,733 --> 00:15:10,693
I've got to hit this copycat
before he hears I'm after him.

65
00:15:10,819 --> 00:15:13,321
To catch him in the act,
I need better information than he has,

66
00:15:13,405 --> 00:15:14,925
the kind that takes months to dig out.

67
00:15:15,032 --> 00:15:18,868
Like who has jewels
that deserve to be stolen?

68
00:15:18,994 --> 00:15:21,412
Yeah. Where they live,
which room they keep the stones in,

69
00:15:21,538 --> 00:15:23,739
what time they usually go to sleep,
how much they drink,

70
00:15:23,832 --> 00:15:26,375
whether they have dogs,
guns, servants, insurance.

71
00:15:26,502 --> 00:15:29,754
Well, for old times' sakes,
perhaps I can help you.

72
00:15:31,757 --> 00:15:35,343
- Come on, Bertani. What have you got?
- You made me remember something.

73
00:15:35,427 --> 00:15:38,012
Two days ago,
a man came into this restaurant.

74
00:15:38,096 --> 00:15:40,139
- I did not like him.
- Why not?

75
00:15:40,224 --> 00:15:41,641
He called me to his table.

76
00:15:41,725 --> 00:15:44,393
He asked me about crime
and criminals,

77
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,730
me, a respectable, honest restaurateur.

78
00:15:47,856 --> 00:15:49,896
You think he may know something
about the robberies?

79
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:53,736
He asks me strange questions.
I refuse to answer.

80
00:15:54,238 --> 00:15:57,865
Then he asked me
about the jewels my clients wear,

81
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:02,537
and I said to myself, "You have
something to do with this new Cat."

82
00:16:02,913 --> 00:16:05,248
"Maybe you are the new Cat."

83
00:16:35,112 --> 00:16:37,321
Foussard's daughter will take you
out of here by boat.

84
00:16:37,447 --> 00:16:38,614
- Where?
- The beach club in Cannes.

85
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:40,658
Wait for a phone call there.

86
00:17:16,486 --> 00:17:18,112
Okay, Mr. Cat, let's go.

87
00:17:18,196 --> 00:17:21,282
Danielle, do me a favor.
Don't call me a cat.

88
00:17:21,366 --> 00:17:23,492
I only do one favor a day.

89
00:17:25,162 --> 00:17:26,704
Will you do as your father here asks?

90
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:29,498
Did I brush your fur the wrong way?

91
00:18:05,744 --> 00:18:07,370
Hey, you're getting us wet.

92
00:18:07,454 --> 00:18:11,123
It must be true, what they say.
Cats don't like water.

93
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:13,834
I'll thank you
not to mention that word again.

94
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,754
A man should never regret his past.

95
00:18:17,047 --> 00:18:21,425
- I only regret one thing.
- That you never asked me to marry you?

96
00:18:21,551 --> 00:18:24,428
No, that I ever took the time
to teach you English.

97
00:18:24,554 --> 00:18:28,516
You only taught me the nouns.
I learned the adjectives myself.

98
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,019
- The word "cat" is a noun.
- Not the way you use it.

99
00:18:32,104 --> 00:18:36,691
For you it means excitement,
danger, affluence.

100
00:18:36,775 --> 00:18:39,402
What do you think
of that word, "affluence"?

101
00:18:39,486 --> 00:18:41,445
It means wealth.

102
00:18:42,739 --> 00:18:44,573
What's on your mind?

103
00:18:44,658 --> 00:18:47,368
Nothing. I was just thinking about you.

104
00:18:47,452 --> 00:18:51,789
Imagining you in your expensive villa,
enjoying life,

105
00:18:51,915 --> 00:18:54,667
while we work like idiots
for a loaf of bread.

106
00:18:54,751 --> 00:18:57,169
I work for a living, too,
raising grapes and flowers.

107
00:18:57,254 --> 00:19:00,089
And rubies and diamonds and pearls.

108
00:19:02,426 --> 00:19:05,761
School's open again. Professor Robie
will now conduct a class

109
00:19:05,846 --> 00:19:08,472
in bad manners,
or how to get spanked in a hurry.

110
00:19:08,598 --> 00:19:11,600
You can't touch me. I've graduated.

111
00:19:12,019 --> 00:19:16,439
- You going to South America?
- No, just the beach club at Cannes.

112
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:20,067
I've always dreamed
of going to South America.

113
00:19:20,152 --> 00:19:22,778
People say it's a virgin country.

114
00:19:23,613 --> 00:19:27,825
I can cook, sew, keep my mouth shut

115
00:19:28,285 --> 00:19:31,287
and peddle stolen jewels
on the black market.

116
00:19:33,165 --> 00:19:35,624
Now, Danielle,
you don't think I'm responsible

117
00:19:35,709 --> 00:19:37,543
for all those recent robberies?

118
00:19:37,627 --> 00:19:40,004
- I think so, yes.
- Yes.

119
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:43,090
Together with your father
and the rest of my old Resistance pals.

120
00:19:43,175 --> 00:19:45,509
But there's one great difference.

121
00:19:45,635 --> 00:19:48,220
They are furious with you. I am not.

122
00:19:48,305 --> 00:19:51,599
Danielle, listen carefully.
I stole once a long time ago.

123
00:19:51,683 --> 00:19:53,350
- I went to jail.
- I know.

124
00:19:53,477 --> 00:19:55,644
The Germans bombed the prison
and you all escaped,

125
00:19:55,729 --> 00:19:57,772
joined the Underground
and became heroes.

126
00:19:57,856 --> 00:20:01,233
I joined because I wanted to make up
for some of the things I'd done.

127
00:20:01,318 --> 00:20:03,903
- I've never stolen since.
- I don't know what you wanted.

128
00:20:03,987 --> 00:20:07,239
I know what you got.
Pardons that are not worth anything.

129
00:20:07,324 --> 00:20:09,283
They weren't pardons,
they were paroles,

130
00:20:09,367 --> 00:20:11,827
and we fought for six years
to earn them,

131
00:20:11,912 --> 00:20:14,288
those of us who were still around
for the graduation.

132
00:20:14,372 --> 00:20:17,041
Those paroles don't have
much value today?

133
00:20:17,167 --> 00:20:20,127
Well, at least they haven't been
withdrawn from circulation.

134
00:20:20,212 --> 00:20:22,546
No South America?

135
00:20:22,672 --> 00:20:25,966
No, just the beach club
at Cannes, please.

136
00:20:26,051 --> 00:20:29,220
Well, in that case, we should hurry.

137
00:20:29,346 --> 00:20:32,848
That airplane up there,
it probably belongs to the police.

138
00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:39,021
Hey, stupide, the contact.

139
00:20:49,032 --> 00:20:51,033
What's he doing now?

140
00:20:52,369 --> 00:20:53,828
He's coming back over us.

141
00:20:53,912 --> 00:20:56,413
Good. When he comes by again,
wave to him.

142
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:59,166
- Suppose he's not my type?
- Wave to him anyway.

143
00:20:59,251 --> 00:21:02,211
Act as if you're a pretty girl
just out for a ride.

144
00:21:02,295 --> 00:21:03,462
Well...

145
00:21:09,803 --> 00:21:13,389
Hey, hey, not that pretty.
We want to get rid of him.

146
00:21:14,724 --> 00:21:17,768
- How much further to the beach club?
- About 15 minutes.

147
00:21:19,271 --> 00:21:21,313
Well, when you get there,
pull close in shore

148
00:21:21,398 --> 00:21:22,959
and mingle around with the other boats.

149
00:21:22,983 --> 00:21:24,024
And then?

150
00:21:24,109 --> 00:21:26,861
And then I'm getting out.
I'll leave my clothes with you.

151
00:21:26,945 --> 00:21:29,905
And I thought
you hoped to be inconspicuous.

152
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:32,783
Well, nobody will ever recognize me
in these.

153
00:22:39,184 --> 00:22:42,102
- Hello?
- The man I speak with you about,

154
00:22:42,187 --> 00:22:44,980
the man who asked me
the questions about the jewels,

155
00:22:45,065 --> 00:22:48,275
he will wait for you at the entrance
of the flower market in Nice.

156
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:53,530
He will find you. I told him
you would be tossing a coin in the air.

157
00:23:42,038 --> 00:23:43,706
Tails?

158
00:23:50,714 --> 00:23:53,090
H.H. Hughson, Lloyd's of London.

159
00:23:53,216 --> 00:23:55,509
Am I to understand
you're the man who knows everyone

160
00:23:55,593 --> 00:23:58,429
who owns the best jewelry
in this vicinity?

161
00:23:58,555 --> 00:24:00,681
We insure most of the important pieces.

162
00:24:00,765 --> 00:24:03,934
Insurance. That's gambling, isn't it?

163
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:06,103
Well, shall we say betting?

164
00:24:06,229 --> 00:24:09,606
Yes, let's just say betting,
because I have a long shot for you.

165
00:24:09,733 --> 00:24:12,693
A little help
in return for some of your losses.

166
00:24:12,777 --> 00:24:16,071
- So Mr. Bertani told me.
- Are you interested?

167
00:24:16,156 --> 00:24:20,743
Well, the proposition sounds
intriguing, albeit a little unorthodox.

168
00:24:21,745 --> 00:24:23,620
What does that mean? Yes or no?

169
00:24:23,747 --> 00:24:25,873
- My dear Mr. Robie...
- Smith.

170
00:24:25,957 --> 00:24:28,292
I beg your pardon. Ever been married?

171
00:24:28,418 --> 00:24:30,711
No, but what has that to do
with yes or no?

172
00:24:30,795 --> 00:24:33,130
It might help you
to understand my problem.

173
00:24:33,256 --> 00:24:35,841
I have two wives,
Felicity, God bless her,

174
00:24:35,925 --> 00:24:38,677
and the London office.
I must return worthy of both of them.

175
00:24:38,762 --> 00:24:41,347
I see. And you don't think
they'd approve of your giving me

176
00:24:41,431 --> 00:24:43,390
a list of your richest clients.

177
00:24:43,475 --> 00:24:46,935
Officially, you come under
the category of extremely bad risk.

178
00:24:51,316 --> 00:24:52,733
Well, see you later, Hughson.

179
00:24:52,817 --> 00:24:55,027
It's always a pleasure
to meet an insurance agent

180
00:24:55,111 --> 00:24:58,155
who enjoys paying off
such expensive claims.

181
00:25:01,117 --> 00:25:03,744
However, unofficially,
there's hope for you.

182
00:25:03,828 --> 00:25:05,245
I was sure there would be.

183
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:07,289
We're both taking a big chance,
you know.

184
00:25:07,374 --> 00:25:10,459
Really? What happens to you
if I'm caught?

185
00:25:10,543 --> 00:25:13,712
I might be embarrassed,
even censured officially.

186
00:25:13,838 --> 00:25:17,424
- They could put me away for good.
- You made a bad choice of professions.

187
00:25:17,509 --> 00:25:19,593
Well, then let's come
to an understanding.

188
00:25:19,677 --> 00:25:21,595
I'm doing you a favor.

189
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:24,223
I take all the risks,
you get all the jewelry back.

190
00:25:24,307 --> 00:25:28,352
Mr. Smith, it strikes me that only
an honest man would be so foolish.

191
00:25:28,478 --> 00:25:29,895
Thank you.

192
00:25:33,024 --> 00:25:35,624
- How much of a list do you need?
- Only the top half-dozen names.

193
00:25:35,693 --> 00:25:38,112
- Anything else?
- The addresses, habits,

194
00:25:38,196 --> 00:25:41,990
whatever you've got.
Descriptions of the stones and settings.

195
00:25:43,493 --> 00:25:46,013
- Suppose it falls into the wrong hands?
- Perhaps it already has,

196
00:25:46,037 --> 00:25:47,621
unless you've been
pulling the thefts yourself.

197
00:25:47,705 --> 00:25:48,865
I say, that's not a bad idea.

198
00:25:48,915 --> 00:25:50,457
- And where are you staying?
- Carlton, Cannes.

199
00:25:50,542 --> 00:25:51,708
Okay.

200
00:27:05,992 --> 00:27:09,244
No, no, no, my dear fellow,
not in the middle of the day.

201
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:15,834
Bring it to the table with you.

202
00:27:21,424 --> 00:27:22,799
Come along.

203
00:27:31,351 --> 00:27:35,437
Under the present circumstances,
do you think it pays to advertise?

204
00:27:35,605 --> 00:27:37,940
He hasn't left the villa in years.

205
00:27:40,527 --> 00:27:43,195
- Well, how do you like the place?
- Immensely.

206
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,405
It's a kind of travel-folder heaven,

207
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:48,534
where a man dreams he'll go
when he retires.

208
00:27:50,161 --> 00:27:54,039
Now, about that list of your clients
who have jewelry worth stealing.

209
00:27:54,207 --> 00:27:56,083
Look, why don't we
enjoy our lunch first?

210
00:27:56,167 --> 00:27:57,751
There's plenty of time.

211
00:27:57,835 --> 00:27:59,836
Mr. Hughson,
I don't want to seem impatient,

212
00:27:59,963 --> 00:28:02,714
but in 10 days, I have to come up
with something pretty convincing

213
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:04,967
for the examining magistrate.

214
00:28:05,051 --> 00:28:07,761
Now, it's a very nice custom
they have here in France,

215
00:28:07,845 --> 00:28:10,305
provisional liberty
based upon insufficient evidence.

216
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:13,141
But, alas, that may not last long for me.

217
00:28:13,476 --> 00:28:16,895
Bertani said you were something of
a celebrity in the Underground Army.

218
00:28:17,146 --> 00:28:18,939
I was in the Resistance.

219
00:28:19,023 --> 00:28:21,984
- Did you kill many people?
- Seventy-two.

220
00:28:24,487 --> 00:28:26,527
I know what would have pleased you,
though, Hughson.

221
00:28:26,573 --> 00:28:28,824
Not one of them was insured.

222
00:28:29,867 --> 00:28:33,161
You're a man of obvious good taste in...
Well, in everything.

223
00:28:33,246 --> 00:28:35,372
How did you... I mean, why did you...

224
00:28:35,498 --> 00:28:37,499
- You mean, why did I take up stealing?
- Yes.

225
00:28:37,584 --> 00:28:40,085
To live better,
to own things I couldn't afford.

226
00:28:40,169 --> 00:28:42,588
To acquire this good taste
which you now enjoy,

227
00:28:42,672 --> 00:28:45,048
and which I should be
very reluctant to give up.

228
00:28:45,174 --> 00:28:46,967
You mean
you were frankly dishonest?

229
00:28:47,051 --> 00:28:48,594
I tried to be.

230
00:28:49,012 --> 00:28:52,264
You know, I thought you'd have
some defense, some tale of hardship.

231
00:28:52,348 --> 00:28:54,016
Your mother ran off
when you were young,

232
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,310
your father beat you or something.

233
00:28:56,394 --> 00:28:58,895
No, no, no, I was a member
of an American trapeze act

234
00:28:59,022 --> 00:29:00,939
in a circus that traveled in Europe.

235
00:29:01,524 --> 00:29:02,858
It folded and I was stranded,

236
00:29:02,942 --> 00:29:05,694
so I put my agility
to a more rewarding purpose.

237
00:29:05,778 --> 00:29:07,529
You have no other defense?

238
00:29:07,614 --> 00:29:10,699
Well, for what it's worth, I only stole
from people who wouldn't go hungry.

239
00:29:10,783 --> 00:29:12,034
Your plate.

240
00:29:13,536 --> 00:29:15,746
This is a quiche Lorraine.
I think you'll enjoy this.

241
00:29:15,872 --> 00:29:17,914
Quiche... Yes, I've heard of it.
I've never had it, though.

242
00:29:18,041 --> 00:29:20,584
- It looks delicious.
- Yes.

243
00:29:23,046 --> 00:29:26,632
It's wonderful.
And the pastry is as light as air.

244
00:29:26,716 --> 00:29:28,759
Well, Germaine
has very sensitive hands,

245
00:29:28,885 --> 00:29:31,845
- an exceedingly light touch.
- Yes, I can tell.

246
00:29:31,929 --> 00:29:35,390
She strangled a German general once

247
00:29:35,808 --> 00:29:37,476
without a sound.

248
00:29:41,606 --> 00:29:44,900
What an extraordinary woman. I...

249
00:29:45,902 --> 00:29:48,487
I take it
you were a sort of modern Robin Hood.

250
00:29:48,571 --> 00:29:51,990
I mean, you gave away
most of the proceeds of your crimes.

251
00:29:52,408 --> 00:29:54,076
Kept everything myself.

252
00:29:55,787 --> 00:29:59,164
Well, let's face it.
I was an out-and-out thief, like you.

253
00:29:59,457 --> 00:30:02,209
- I say, steady, old man.
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

254
00:30:02,293 --> 00:30:04,961
Did you ever take an ashtray
from a hotel, or a towel?

255
00:30:05,088 --> 00:30:07,089
Souvenirs. They expect that.

256
00:30:07,757 --> 00:30:10,217
You're given an expense allowance
to pay for all the meals

257
00:30:10,301 --> 00:30:13,762
you eat on the job, right?
But this meal is free.

258
00:30:13,846 --> 00:30:16,348
Now, are you going to deduct
the price of a lunch

259
00:30:16,432 --> 00:30:18,642
from your expense account?

260
00:30:18,768 --> 00:30:21,395
But of course you're not.
It would be stupid. Do you agree?

261
00:30:21,479 --> 00:30:23,814
- Yes.
- You're a thief.

262
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,565
Well, only an amateur thief, of course,

263
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:28,402
but it'll help you to sympathize
with us professionals.

264
00:30:28,486 --> 00:30:31,988
- I don't think I understand fully.
- Well, now, let's look at it this way.

265
00:30:32,115 --> 00:30:35,075
You're sorry you took the ashtray
or the towel from the hotel, aren't you?

266
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:37,599
- Well, right now, yes.
- And someday you're going to be sorry

267
00:30:37,662 --> 00:30:39,913
that you didn't deduct this lunch
from your expense account.

268
00:30:39,997 --> 00:30:41,415
My dear fellow, I can't possibly deduct

269
00:30:41,499 --> 00:30:42,958
every little item
from my expense account.

270
00:30:43,042 --> 00:30:46,795
- I frankly couldn't spare the time.
- Well, someday you'll wish you had.

271
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:48,964
Every time an ashtray
is missing from a hotel,

272
00:30:49,048 --> 00:30:50,465
they don't come looking for you.

273
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:52,592
But let a diamond bracelet
disappear in France,

274
00:30:52,677 --> 00:30:55,303
and they shout, "John Robie, the Cat!"

275
00:30:55,805 --> 00:30:57,806
You don't have to spend
every day of your life

276
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:59,975
proving your honesty, but I do.

277
00:31:00,852 --> 00:31:03,562
Well, let's get down to business.
The list.

278
00:31:08,192 --> 00:31:10,068
Is something bothering you?

279
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:13,196
I told the police
what you were going to do.

280
00:31:14,198 --> 00:31:17,200
Well, I didn't expect them
to like my arrangement.

281
00:31:17,326 --> 00:31:19,536
You were wrong.
They thought it a splendid idea,

282
00:31:19,662 --> 00:31:21,182
because they hope
you'll make a mistake

283
00:31:21,205 --> 00:31:23,790
and provide them with the evidence
they need against you.

284
00:31:23,875 --> 00:31:26,710
Yes. it had to be something like that.

285
00:31:30,339 --> 00:31:32,132
Suppose the whole thing goes wrong?

286
00:31:32,216 --> 00:31:34,259
Come on, Hughson,
you're wasting time.

287
00:31:48,566 --> 00:31:52,194
Quite a thorough job.
Have some wine, Hughson.

288
00:31:55,698 --> 00:31:57,449
Yes, I think I will.

289
00:31:58,367 --> 00:32:01,036
My. I wish I'd known
someone in the insurance racket

290
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,122
when I first started
in the burglary business.

291
00:32:05,708 --> 00:32:09,628
Well, let me see.
My first bait will be this Mrs. Stevens,

292
00:32:09,712 --> 00:32:12,589
the American woman with the diamonds
and the daughter.

293
00:32:12,715 --> 00:32:15,509
- Do you know them?
- I'm having dinner with them tomorrow.

294
00:32:15,593 --> 00:32:17,803
I could possibly arrange a meeting.

295
00:32:18,387 --> 00:32:22,015
Hughson, in this business,
you can't do things the honest way.

296
00:32:22,099 --> 00:32:23,558
Remember that.

297
00:32:32,902 --> 00:32:36,279
No, no, what I mean, Mrs. Stevens,
wouldn't it perhaps be better

298
00:32:36,364 --> 00:32:39,199
if you left some of that jewelry
in the hotel safe?

299
00:32:39,283 --> 00:32:40,723
Stop acting like an insurance agent.

300
00:32:40,743 --> 00:32:44,371
I didn't buy these things for my old age.
I bought them to wear.

301
00:32:45,665 --> 00:32:47,249
Put your money away, Hughson.

302
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:49,960
You can cheat a little
on your expense account.

303
00:32:58,094 --> 00:32:59,511
That's France.

304
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:02,039
Yes, and everyone from
the vegetable scrubber to the manager

305
00:33:02,056 --> 00:33:04,933
gets a tip, whether he's earned it or not.
It's the law.

306
00:33:05,017 --> 00:33:07,894
Mother, everywhere you go,
you complain about tipping.

307
00:33:07,979 --> 00:33:11,273
And I shall continue to complain.
I've just paid for the privilege.

308
00:33:13,192 --> 00:33:16,862
Come on. Let's go over to the casino.
I want to hit the tables while they're hot.

309
00:33:16,946 --> 00:33:19,573
Perhaps I should
just mail them the money.

310
00:33:19,657 --> 00:33:22,784
No. No, don't bother, Pierre.
I can't afford it.

311
00:33:27,081 --> 00:33:30,333
Handsome.
I wouldn't mind buying that for you.

312
00:33:30,418 --> 00:33:32,252
- Mother.
- Come along.

313
00:33:32,336 --> 00:33:34,129
Maybe Mr. Hughson
doesn't care for gambling.

314
00:33:34,213 --> 00:33:37,215
Everyone likes to gamble,
one way or another, even you.

315
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,134
I have an intense dislike for it.

316
00:33:39,218 --> 00:33:42,637
Francie, dear,
when the stakes are right, you'll gamble.

317
00:33:43,347 --> 00:33:45,765
It's an imitation? Really?

318
00:33:46,642 --> 00:33:49,644
You mean costume jewelry?
Well, what do you know?

319
00:33:49,729 --> 00:33:51,479
The things they make these days.

320
00:33:51,564 --> 00:33:53,607
Why, you can hardly tell it
from the real thing.

321
00:33:53,691 --> 00:33:56,526
Well, it's better than anything
we have back in Portland, Oregon.

322
00:33:56,611 --> 00:33:58,653
Almost everything is.

323
00:33:59,113 --> 00:34:00,155
Thank you.

324
00:34:10,541 --> 00:34:13,501
I should never have stopped here.
Baccarat's my game.

325
00:34:13,586 --> 00:34:16,922
Why did you let me get so close
to this whirling pickpocket, anyway?

326
00:34:20,217 --> 00:34:21,885
Wouldn't you know?

327
00:34:51,374 --> 00:34:52,958
I'm terribly sorry, madam. I'm...

328
00:35:00,716 --> 00:35:02,842
Yes, but, madam, that...

329
00:35:04,261 --> 00:35:07,013
Well, that was a 10,000 franc plaque.

330
00:35:16,607 --> 00:35:19,025
Well, maybe she doesn't...

331
00:35:19,568 --> 00:35:23,571
Well, of course, madam, if you'd
rather not take my word, it's all right.

332
00:35:26,742 --> 00:35:30,412
Well, thank you. I'll trust you, too.
I won't count it.

333
00:35:43,092 --> 00:35:45,218
If Jeremiah were only here.

334
00:35:45,594 --> 00:35:48,430
But he'd think all this flying around
from Palm Springs

335
00:35:48,514 --> 00:35:51,808
to Saint Moritz to the Riviera...
He'd think it was all foolishness.

336
00:35:51,892 --> 00:35:55,437
He used to say, "I wouldn't be
one of those silly society gadabouts"

337
00:35:55,521 --> 00:35:58,314
"if they promised me
I could live forever."

338
00:35:58,774 --> 00:36:00,650
Well, he got his wish.

339
00:36:01,819 --> 00:36:03,945
Mr. Burns,
where'd you say you were from?

340
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:07,157
- Oregon.
- Jeremiah would have liked you.

341
00:36:07,658 --> 00:36:11,119
A man with both feet on the ground,
that's what he was.

342
00:36:11,203 --> 00:36:13,955
Unfortunately for him,
he never realized how valuable

343
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,124
the ground was he had his feet on.

344
00:36:16,208 --> 00:36:18,460
- We had a ranch, you see. it wasn't...
- Mother, please.

345
00:36:18,544 --> 00:36:20,837
Mr. Burns would be very interested.

346
00:36:20,921 --> 00:36:23,298
We had a ranch.
It wasn't a very big one.

347
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:26,718
No plumbing. Little thing out back.

348
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:29,012
Poor Jeremiah.

349
00:36:29,096 --> 00:36:32,515
He'll never know how close he came
to 20 million barrels of oil.

350
00:36:36,979 --> 00:36:38,605
Bourbon's the only drink.

351
00:36:38,689 --> 00:36:41,691
You can take all that champagne stuff
and pour it down the English Channel.

352
00:36:41,776 --> 00:36:45,028
Well, why wait 80 years
before you can drink the stuff?

353
00:36:45,154 --> 00:36:48,907
Grape vineyards,
huge barrels aging forever,

354
00:36:49,617 --> 00:36:51,659
poor little old monks
running around testing it,

355
00:36:51,744 --> 00:36:55,580
just so some woman in Tulsa,
Oklahoma, can say it tickles her nose.

356
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,708
Mother, I think we ought to go to bed.

357
00:37:00,336 --> 00:37:02,837
Nobody ever calls me Jessie anymore.

358
00:37:06,008 --> 00:37:08,343
Mr. Burns, would you call me Jessie?

359
00:37:08,427 --> 00:37:10,386
- I'd be happy to.
- Good.

360
00:37:13,349 --> 00:37:15,517
Mr. Hughson, would you call me Jessie?

361
00:37:15,601 --> 00:37:17,685
- If you like.
- I like.

362
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:21,856
- Mr. Burns, you said lumber?
- That's right.

363
00:37:21,941 --> 00:37:24,400
How come you haven't made a pass
at my daughter?

364
00:37:24,485 --> 00:37:26,903
And don't say "Mother" to me.

365
00:37:28,572 --> 00:37:30,990
Mr. Burns, I asked you a question.

366
00:37:31,367 --> 00:37:33,785
Very pretty. Quietly attractive.

367
00:37:35,162 --> 00:37:36,871
Yeah, but too nice.

368
00:37:36,956 --> 00:37:38,832
Sorry I ever sent her
to that finishing school.

369
00:37:38,916 --> 00:37:40,708
I think they finished her there.

370
00:37:40,876 --> 00:37:43,795
- Come on, Mother.
- And so to bed,

371
00:37:44,463 --> 00:37:46,965
where I can cuddle up to my jewelry.

372
00:37:47,049 --> 00:37:50,760
You know, Mr. Hughson,
as rare and wonderful as they are,

373
00:37:50,845 --> 00:37:53,721
I think I'd rather have
100,000 Jeremiahs.

374
00:37:53,806 --> 00:37:55,682
Well, I think I'll toddle along to my cot.

375
00:37:55,766 --> 00:37:57,934
I'll be delighted
to escort you to your suite.

376
00:37:58,018 --> 00:38:00,728
That's very thoughtful of you, Mr. Burns.
Come on, Jessie.

377
00:38:00,813 --> 00:38:04,065
Mr. Burns,
do you make much money at lumber?

378
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:06,901
Well, right now building is booming.

379
00:38:07,862 --> 00:38:10,280
Would you mind
if I had you investigated a little?

380
00:38:10,364 --> 00:38:12,699
Not at all. With what object?

381
00:38:13,242 --> 00:38:16,703
Well, if I were Francie's age,
you'd sound too good to be true.

382
00:38:31,093 --> 00:38:32,927
Thank you, Mr. Burns. That...

383
00:38:34,013 --> 00:38:36,973
You know,
there's very little lumber around here.

384
00:38:37,057 --> 00:38:39,350
Just why did you come
to the Riviera, anyway?

385
00:38:39,435 --> 00:38:41,853
To meet someone as charming as you.

386
00:38:42,479 --> 00:38:45,440
Boy, now I am
going to have you investigated.

387
00:38:46,442 --> 00:38:49,527
- Aren't you going in?
- I'm down the other end.

388
00:40:09,191 --> 00:40:11,693
How much did he get away with
last night?

389
00:40:11,777 --> 00:40:15,196
The gems were insured
for 35,000 in dollars.

390
00:40:15,531 --> 00:40:17,323
Somebody wins, somebody loses.

391
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:19,575
Hughson, I sympathize with you.

392
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:22,421
Pretty rough, having to send
bad news like that into your home office.

393
00:40:22,454 --> 00:40:24,372
I insured Madame Leroux personally.

394
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:28,584
Yeah. Well, at least you know that the...
You know, the burglar.

395
00:40:28,669 --> 00:40:31,004
- What do they call him? The...
- The Cat.

396
00:40:31,088 --> 00:40:32,463
Yes.

397
00:40:33,549 --> 00:40:37,302
Well, at least you know he's still around
and getting closer all the time.

398
00:40:37,386 --> 00:40:38,720
That's something, isn't it?

399
00:40:38,804 --> 00:40:43,099
Mrs. Stevens, would you kindly
keep your jewelry in the hotel safe?

400
00:40:43,183 --> 00:40:45,601
And what do I do when I go out,
wear the safe around my neck?

401
00:40:45,686 --> 00:40:49,188
- Well, no, not literally. it's just that...
- It's just that your insurance company

402
00:40:49,273 --> 00:40:51,399
goes into shock
every time something's stolen.

403
00:40:51,483 --> 00:40:53,943
If you haven't any guts,
why, you shouldn't have taken my bet.

404
00:40:54,028 --> 00:40:57,447
Well, that's what it was, a bet.
Now, you want to welsh?

405
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:00,325
If your jewels are stolen,
you will be paid, of course,

406
00:41:00,409 --> 00:41:02,577
but we couldn't replace
the sentiment and affection

407
00:41:02,661 --> 00:41:04,162
you have for those particular pieces.

408
00:41:04,246 --> 00:41:07,373
Mr. Hughson, I have no more affection
for that jewelry

409
00:41:07,458 --> 00:41:10,376
than I have for a train ticket
that gets me somewhere.

410
00:41:10,502 --> 00:41:12,754
They're pretty and they attract attention.

411
00:41:12,921 --> 00:41:14,881
Most of all,
they make it possible for my daughter

412
00:41:14,882 --> 00:41:17,675
to go to the right places
and not be ashamed of me.

413
00:41:17,926 --> 00:41:19,886
That is, too ashamed of me.

414
00:41:20,095 --> 00:41:22,597
- Good morning, Mr. Hughson.
- Good morning, Miss Stevens.

415
00:41:24,016 --> 00:41:26,059
- Mr. Burns.
- You sent for me?

416
00:41:26,143 --> 00:41:30,521
Yes, I thought we might go for a swim,
or, if you're not athletic, sunbathing.

417
00:41:30,606 --> 00:41:33,608
I think I can manage to stay afloat,
thank you.

418
00:41:34,276 --> 00:41:36,477
Mr. Hughson's been telling us
about a robbery last night

419
00:41:36,528 --> 00:41:38,821
- after we went to bed.
- Who?

420
00:41:38,906 --> 00:41:41,282
Madame Leroux,
wife of a high government official.

421
00:41:41,367 --> 00:41:44,535
- $35,000.
- Too bad.

422
00:41:45,079 --> 00:41:47,413
You should find a more happy business.

423
00:41:47,498 --> 00:41:50,583
The famous jewel thief, the Cat,
is loose again, they say.

424
00:41:50,667 --> 00:41:54,420
- Well, Mother, you're next.
- I'm insured.

425
00:41:55,005 --> 00:41:57,632
Well, I'll get my bathing trunks.
Meet you in the lobby.

426
00:41:57,716 --> 00:42:00,036
I'll just slip into something
and be down in a few minutes.

427
00:42:00,052 --> 00:42:01,844
Goodbye, Mrs. Stevens.
Good hunting, Hughson.

428
00:42:01,929 --> 00:42:05,723
Just a minute, Mr. Burns.
Weren't we... Weren't we going to...

429
00:42:06,308 --> 00:42:07,548
Weren't we what? Going to what?

430
00:42:07,601 --> 00:42:09,769
Well, last night we discussed going up.

431
00:42:09,853 --> 00:42:11,437
- Up? Up?
- Up. Up.

432
00:42:11,522 --> 00:42:16,484
- Up the funicular railway.
- I can't even spell funicular.

433
00:42:18,612 --> 00:42:20,363
What are you doing this afternoon?

434
00:42:20,447 --> 00:42:22,323
I went to a real estate agent.

435
00:42:22,408 --> 00:42:24,826
He gave me a list
of furnished villas for rent.

436
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:29,831
- Do you plan that long a vacation?
- I might even retire here.

437
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,500
It says that some of the villas
aren't in very good repair.

438
00:42:32,584 --> 00:42:35,753
Quite a few of the roofs
need careful examination.

439
00:42:36,713 --> 00:42:39,507
Goodbye, Hughson.
Don't let the robbery spoil your day.

440
00:42:39,591 --> 00:42:42,218
It's only money,
and not even yours at that.

441
00:43:01,613 --> 00:43:04,240
Should I ask the social director
to introduce us?

442
00:43:04,324 --> 00:43:08,035
No, no, no. I was just wondering
which was the best way out of here.

443
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:10,538
Well, the Mediterranean
used to be this way.

444
00:43:10,622 --> 00:43:13,166
Well, I'm a gambler. Let's try that.

445
00:43:27,973 --> 00:43:29,765
There's a message for you.

446
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:36,564
Thank you.

447
00:44:56,979 --> 00:45:00,439
You performed a very beautiful robbery
last night.

448
00:45:00,524 --> 00:45:03,484
- Strictly routine.
- You're marvelous.

449
00:45:03,735 --> 00:45:05,528
Last night you steal a small fortune,

450
00:45:05,612 --> 00:45:08,614
and today you lie on the beach
with an American beauty.

451
00:45:08,699 --> 00:45:11,033
Well, that's why one needs
a small fortune.

452
00:45:11,118 --> 00:45:13,160
Is this your next victim?

453
00:45:13,787 --> 00:45:15,955
Well, let's just say she's a useful friend.

454
00:45:17,082 --> 00:45:20,293
You know,
your old friends of the Resistance

455
00:45:20,377 --> 00:45:25,339
who work at the restaurant, they called
the police all sorts of terrible names

456
00:45:25,424 --> 00:45:27,675
when they had to let you go yesterday.

457
00:45:27,759 --> 00:45:30,344
Would it be bad manners to ask
who tipped off the police

458
00:45:30,429 --> 00:45:31,679
at the flower market?

459
00:45:31,763 --> 00:45:33,639
They never say anything
to the flics.

460
00:45:33,724 --> 00:45:35,891
- You know that.
- Well, somebody did.

461
00:45:35,976 --> 00:45:40,521
But still, they would be very happy
if you were caught during your next job.

462
00:45:40,647 --> 00:45:42,773
Well, it's nice to know I have friends.

463
00:45:42,858 --> 00:45:45,443
Perhaps it would be better
if you were caught.

464
00:45:45,527 --> 00:45:47,445
Any particular reason?

465
00:45:47,529 --> 00:45:49,405
I heard some talk in the kitchen.

466
00:45:49,489 --> 00:45:53,034
They say, "What a pity
if they must kill the Cat."

467
00:45:53,201 --> 00:45:55,494
They will do all they can
to avoid the prison.

468
00:45:55,579 --> 00:45:58,205
Well, now, isn't that amazing?
The police want me in jail.

469
00:45:58,290 --> 00:46:01,208
My old friends want me dead.
The Cat wants me out of town.

470
00:46:01,293 --> 00:46:03,586
What do you mean,
the Cat wants you out of town?

471
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:05,129
He sent me a message this morning.

472
00:46:05,213 --> 00:46:07,465
It seems the sky
is about to fall in on me.

473
00:46:07,549 --> 00:46:10,092
Then don't you think
it's foolish to remain here

474
00:46:10,177 --> 00:46:12,720
without knowing
what will happen to you?

475
00:46:12,804 --> 00:46:16,015
But if you were
in South America with me,

476
00:46:16,099 --> 00:46:18,309
you would know
exactly what will happen.

477
00:46:18,393 --> 00:46:21,187
You make it sound dangerous
either way.

478
00:46:21,271 --> 00:46:24,690
It would be so much nicer
to be killed by love, no?

479
00:46:25,192 --> 00:46:27,568
Pardon me
while I get the water out of my ear.

480
00:46:27,653 --> 00:46:31,656
John, you know what sort of men
they are at Bertani's.

481
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:34,283
Another robbery
and they will do something to you.

482
00:46:34,368 --> 00:46:36,952
Yes, yes. Well, I better get back.

483
00:46:38,497 --> 00:46:42,124
But what has she got more than me,
except money?

484
00:46:42,542 --> 00:46:45,086
And you are getting plenty of that.

485
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:49,423
Danielle, you are just a girl.
She is a woman.

486
00:46:50,133 --> 00:46:54,970
Why do you want to buy an old car
if you can get a new one cheaper?

487
00:46:55,138 --> 00:46:58,057
It will run better and last longer.

488
00:47:00,268 --> 00:47:02,812
It looks as if my old car just drove off.

489
00:47:02,896 --> 00:47:05,147
No, it hasn't. it's just turned amphibious.

490
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,776
I thought I'd come out
and see what the big attraction was.

491
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:11,612
- Yes.
- And possibly even rate an introduction.

492
00:47:11,697 --> 00:47:13,948
You didn't tell me your name.

493
00:47:14,032 --> 00:47:17,159
- Danielle Foussard.
- Miss Foussard, Miss Stevens.

494
00:47:17,244 --> 00:47:19,412
How do you do, Miss Foussard?

495
00:47:19,496 --> 00:47:21,997
Mr. Burns has told me
so little about you.

496
00:47:22,874 --> 00:47:24,625
Well, we only met
a couple of minutes ago.

497
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:26,460
That's right. Only a few minutes ago.

498
00:47:26,545 --> 00:47:30,673
Only a few minutes ago,
and you talk like old friends.

499
00:47:31,091 --> 00:47:33,926
Well, that's warm, friendly France
for you.

500
00:47:34,553 --> 00:47:37,012
Well, I was asking
about renting some water skis.

501
00:47:37,097 --> 00:47:39,140
Would you like me
to teach you how to water ski?

502
00:47:39,224 --> 00:47:40,891
Thank you,
but I was women's champion

503
00:47:40,976 --> 00:47:43,227
at Sarasota, Florida, last season.

504
00:47:43,311 --> 00:47:45,187
Well, it was just an idea.

505
00:47:46,189 --> 00:47:48,733
Are you sure
you were talking about water skis?

506
00:47:48,817 --> 00:47:49,859
From where I sat,

507
00:47:49,943 --> 00:47:52,987
it looked as though you were
conjugating some irregular verbs.

508
00:47:54,322 --> 00:47:56,824
Say something nice to her, Danielle.

509
00:47:57,534 --> 00:47:59,785
She looks a lot older up close.

510
00:48:02,789 --> 00:48:06,834
To a mere child,
anything over 20 might seem old.

511
00:48:07,127 --> 00:48:12,089
A child? Shall we stand
in shallower water and discuss that?

512
00:48:15,677 --> 00:48:17,595
Enjoying yourself, Mr. Burns?

513
00:48:17,679 --> 00:48:20,139
It's very nice out here.
You know, the sun and all.

514
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:22,516
Well, it's too much for me.
I'll see you at the hotel.

515
00:48:22,601 --> 00:48:25,519
- I'll come with you.
- But, Mr. Burns, you didn't finish

516
00:48:25,604 --> 00:48:29,190
telling me why French women are
more seductive than American women.

517
00:48:29,274 --> 00:48:31,609
You know what I'd like to tell you,
don't you?

518
00:48:31,693 --> 00:48:33,569
Wait a minute!

519
00:48:34,362 --> 00:48:35,404
For...

520
00:49:19,115 --> 00:49:20,241
Here.

521
00:49:58,113 --> 00:49:59,780
Do you have time for me now?

522
00:49:59,865 --> 00:50:02,032
Well, I'm sorry I was so long
out there at the float.

523
00:50:02,117 --> 00:50:04,869
From what I saw of that girl,
I thought you'd be a lot longer.

524
00:50:04,953 --> 00:50:08,914
Yeah. Well, what about cocktails?
6:00 suit you?

525
00:50:08,999 --> 00:50:11,458
Well, we can talk about that on the way.

526
00:50:11,543 --> 00:50:14,211
- To where?
- To rent you a villa.

527
00:50:15,130 --> 00:50:18,507
Miss Stevens, picking out a villa is...
You know, it's a personal thing.

528
00:50:18,592 --> 00:50:22,136
I have my car, and a basket lunch
with chicken and beer.

529
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:23,762
No, no, no.
It's too much to expect of you.

530
00:50:23,847 --> 00:50:25,973
It'll be a tiring, dusty trip
over mountain roads...

531
00:50:26,057 --> 00:50:27,474
Where you're bound to get lost.

532
00:50:27,559 --> 00:50:30,144
A perfect stranger who doesn't know
a word of the language?

533
00:50:30,228 --> 00:50:32,438
Well, I was going to hire
an English-speaking chauffeur.

534
00:50:32,522 --> 00:50:33,939
You have one.

535
00:50:34,065 --> 00:50:37,151
I'll give you a wholesale rate,
and no tipping.

536
00:50:38,445 --> 00:50:41,030
I must say your terms are generous.

537
00:50:43,533 --> 00:50:46,952
- Too generous to refuse.
- My terms usually are.

538
00:50:47,245 --> 00:50:49,747
- Where's your car?
- It's right there.

539
00:50:49,831 --> 00:50:53,751
Well, I guess I can't seem to
get out of this gracefully, so let's go.

540
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:46,845
I've been waiting all day
for you to mention

541
00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:49,431
that kiss I gave you last night.

542
00:51:50,392 --> 00:51:53,978
You know, back home in Oregon,
we'd call you a headstrong girl.

543
00:51:54,062 --> 00:51:56,438
Where in Oregon, the Rogue River?

544
00:51:57,315 --> 00:51:58,440
Where were you born?

545
00:51:58,525 --> 00:52:02,069
In a taxi,
halfway between home and the hospital.

546
00:52:02,153 --> 00:52:04,321
I've lived in 27 different towns
and cities.

547
00:52:04,406 --> 00:52:06,156
Why? Somebody chasing you?

548
00:52:06,241 --> 00:52:09,118
- Boys.
- Well, you can stop running now.

549
00:52:09,452 --> 00:52:12,621
When I was 10, my father died
and they discovered oil on our land,

550
00:52:12,706 --> 00:52:14,581
and that's when I really started to travel.

551
00:52:14,666 --> 00:52:16,458
You mean the boys' fathers
were chasing you?

552
00:52:16,543 --> 00:52:17,668
Yes.

553
00:52:17,752 --> 00:52:19,503
But I had the funny feeling
that all they wanted

554
00:52:19,587 --> 00:52:21,588
was to get their hands on my money.

555
00:52:21,673 --> 00:52:23,215
I'm impressed.

556
00:52:23,299 --> 00:52:25,175
Well, on second thought,
back home in Oregon,

557
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:27,094
we'd have called you
a rich, headstrong girl.

558
00:52:27,178 --> 00:52:30,681
- That would have made it all right.
- Money handles most people.

559
00:52:30,765 --> 00:52:33,434
- Do you honestly believe that?
- I've proved it.

560
00:52:33,518 --> 00:52:36,395
- You're a singular girl.
- Is that good or bad?

561
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:39,273
It's good. it's quite good.
You know what you want,

562
00:52:39,357 --> 00:52:42,192
you go out after it,
and nothing stops you from getting it.

563
00:52:42,277 --> 00:52:43,986
You make it sound corny.

564
00:52:44,112 --> 00:52:47,531
No, you're a jackpot
of admirable character traits.

565
00:52:47,615 --> 00:52:49,241
I already knew that.

566
00:52:49,325 --> 00:52:51,618
Yes, I will say
you do things with dispatch.

567
00:52:51,703 --> 00:52:52,828
No wasted preliminaries.

568
00:52:52,912 --> 00:52:57,833
Not only did I enjoy that kiss last night,
I was awed by the efficiency behind it.

569
00:52:57,917 --> 00:53:00,711
Well, I'm a great believer
in getting down to essentials.

570
00:53:00,795 --> 00:53:04,631
Yes, inviting me for breakfast,
planning a swim, and now this drive.

571
00:53:04,716 --> 00:53:07,801
Miss Stevens,
I must say you are a girl in a million.

572
00:53:07,886 --> 00:53:10,429
That's a routine compliment,
but I'll accept it.

573
00:53:11,723 --> 00:53:15,976
- May I ask you a personal question?
- I've been hoping you would.

574
00:53:16,061 --> 00:53:19,313
What do you expect to get
out of being so nice to me?

575
00:53:19,397 --> 00:53:21,690
Probably a lot more
than you're willing to offer.

576
00:53:21,775 --> 00:53:23,233
I know.

577
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:26,278
You're here in Europe
to buy a husband?

578
00:53:26,362 --> 00:53:30,282
- The man I want doesn't have a price.
- Well, that eliminates me.

579
00:53:53,681 --> 00:53:56,975
You're absolutely right. Give me
a woman who knows her own mind.

580
00:53:57,060 --> 00:54:00,521
No one gives you a woman like that.
You have to capture her.

581
00:54:00,605 --> 00:54:02,731
- Any particular method?
- Yes.

582
00:54:02,816 --> 00:54:05,984
But it's no good
unless you discover it yourself.

583
00:54:07,529 --> 00:54:09,988
Are you sure this is the right address?

584
00:54:10,073 --> 00:54:12,866
Well, it is a little large,
but it's on the real estate agent's list.

585
00:54:12,951 --> 00:54:15,744
- Let me see.
- Let's look at the gardens first.

586
00:54:15,829 --> 00:54:18,080
No need to bother the people.

587
00:54:19,165 --> 00:54:22,376
- Why don't you own a place like this?
- Palaces are for royalty.

588
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:25,796
We're just common people
with a bank account.

589
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:28,048
That sounds
more like your mother than you.

590
00:54:28,133 --> 00:54:29,842
There's not much difference
between us.

591
00:54:29,926 --> 00:54:31,927
A few years and some grammar.

592
00:54:32,178 --> 00:54:34,388
And jewelry. You never wear any.

593
00:54:34,514 --> 00:54:37,141
I don't like cold things touching my skin.

594
00:54:37,225 --> 00:54:39,351
Why don't you invent
some hot diamonds?

595
00:54:39,435 --> 00:54:41,895
I'd rather spend my money
on more tangible excitement.

596
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:45,065
Tell me,
what do you get a thrill out of most?

597
00:54:45,608 --> 00:54:48,277
I'm still looking for that one.

598
00:54:52,907 --> 00:54:56,076
I thought we were going
to look at the gardens.

599
00:55:00,456 --> 00:55:02,040
I was interested in the architecture.

600
00:55:02,125 --> 00:55:05,419
Mediterranean,
turn of the century, isn't it?

601
00:55:11,092 --> 00:55:15,095
- You never mention your wife.
- Never found the time to get married.

602
00:55:15,221 --> 00:55:17,514
You don't seem to be
pushed for time now.

603
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:20,517
Or did you just come over
to add interesting items to your diary?

604
00:55:20,602 --> 00:55:24,438
Like the name and description of
that French girl you swam out to meet.

605
00:55:24,522 --> 00:55:26,607
You are husband-hunting, after all.

606
00:55:26,691 --> 00:55:28,859
That wasn't jealousy you heard working,

607
00:55:28,943 --> 00:55:32,196
merely disappointment
in your limited imagination.

608
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:34,281
Teenage French girls yet.

609
00:55:34,574 --> 00:55:36,491
I'll bet you snowed her under.

610
00:55:36,618 --> 00:55:39,703
The big, handsome lumberman
from America.

611
00:55:39,787 --> 00:55:42,164
I'll bet you told her
all your trees were sequoias.

612
00:55:42,248 --> 00:55:45,125
Yeah, well, that certainly sounds
like jealousy to me.

613
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:47,294
Don't be ashamed of it. Let it out.

614
00:55:47,545 --> 00:55:51,632
- You're somewhat egotistical.
- Fighting fire with fire.

615
00:55:51,799 --> 00:55:55,052
- Miss Stevens?
- Yes, Mr. Burns?

616
00:55:55,136 --> 00:55:57,179
- You know what I think?
- About what?

617
00:55:57,263 --> 00:56:00,182
- You.
- I don't really care.

618
00:56:02,477 --> 00:56:03,685
Tell me.

619
00:56:04,646 --> 00:56:08,690
You're an insecure, pampered woman
accustomed to attracting men,

620
00:56:09,275 --> 00:56:10,484
but you're not quite sure

621
00:56:10,568 --> 00:56:13,278
whether they're attracted to you
or to your money.

622
00:56:14,113 --> 00:56:17,157
- You may never know.
- Anything else?

623
00:56:17,242 --> 00:56:19,493
What you need is something
I have neither the time

624
00:56:19,577 --> 00:56:21,495
nor the inclination to give you.

625
00:56:21,579 --> 00:56:23,080
And just what is that?

626
00:56:23,164 --> 00:56:26,500
Two weeks with a good man
at Niagara Falls.

627
00:57:05,081 --> 00:57:07,874
I'm hungry.
What about opening that picnic basket?

628
00:57:07,959 --> 00:57:10,877
Not till we get to the picnic grounds.

629
00:57:11,004 --> 00:57:15,048
- Which you've already picked out.
- Which I've already picked out.

630
00:57:15,133 --> 00:57:17,509
- Is it far?
- A few miles.

631
00:57:17,593 --> 00:57:20,679
- Lonely and secluded?
- Naturally.

632
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:32,607
Well, then why are we
dawdling like this?

633
00:57:32,692 --> 00:57:35,736
That's exactly
what was running through my mind.

634
01:00:09,182 --> 01:00:10,724
Hey, slow down.

635
01:00:10,808 --> 01:00:13,935
- And let them catch us?
- Let who catch us?

636
01:00:14,020 --> 01:00:16,688
The police in the black car.
The ones who are following you.

637
01:00:16,772 --> 01:00:19,316
I don't know what you're talking about.
Police following me?

638
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:23,028
Yes, police following you,
John Robie, the Cat.

639
01:00:47,386 --> 01:00:48,803
Lovely day.

640
01:00:48,888 --> 01:00:51,765
Have you ever seen
any place in the world more beautiful?

641
01:00:51,849 --> 01:00:54,643
Just look at the colors
of the sea down there and the sky,

642
01:00:54,727 --> 01:00:58,480
and those little
pink and green buildings on the hill.

643
01:00:58,564 --> 01:01:01,566
Think of all those roofs
you could climb over.

644
01:01:01,984 --> 01:01:04,778
- Who did you call me?
- Robie. John Robie.

645
01:01:04,862 --> 01:01:08,031
One of the world's cleverest
jewel thieves, known as the Cat.

646
01:01:08,115 --> 01:01:09,950
I read all about you in the Paris paper.

647
01:01:10,034 --> 01:01:12,410
You may have read
about somebody called the Cat, but...

648
01:01:12,495 --> 01:01:14,329
- I thought you said you were hungry.
- I am.

649
01:01:14,413 --> 01:01:16,831
Well, the picnic basket's in the trunk.

650
01:01:26,092 --> 01:01:28,051
I hope you try to bluff me, Mr. Robie,

651
01:01:28,135 --> 01:01:31,221
and then I can have the fun
of telling you how clever I was.

652
01:01:31,305 --> 01:01:33,431
Well, since I'm not Mr. Robie
but Mr. Burns,

653
01:01:33,516 --> 01:01:36,184
there would be hardly any point
in trying to bluff you.

654
01:01:36,269 --> 01:01:38,019
Nevertheless,
tell me how clever you were.

655
01:01:38,104 --> 01:01:40,855
Well, the first thing
I noticed about you was...

656
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:43,149
Don't sound so pleased with yourself.

657
01:01:43,234 --> 01:01:45,475
I've never caught a jewel thief before.
It's stimulating.

658
01:01:45,528 --> 01:01:49,489
- It's like... Well, it's like...
- Like sitting in a hot tub?

659
01:01:51,367 --> 01:01:53,410
Here, let me serve.

660
01:01:53,703 --> 01:01:56,288
The first time I saw you
was on the beach at Cannes.

661
01:01:56,372 --> 01:02:00,041
You swam ashore from a motorboat
driven by that little French girl.

662
01:02:00,126 --> 01:02:02,168
You got an opener? Thank you.

663
01:02:02,253 --> 01:02:05,797
- You want a leg or a breast?
- You make the choice.

664
01:02:06,507 --> 01:02:09,050
That was just two days
before you showed up at the hotel

665
01:02:09,135 --> 01:02:12,721
as Mr. Conrad Burns,
just over from America.

666
01:02:12,805 --> 01:02:14,347
Did you swim?

667
01:02:14,432 --> 01:02:15,724
Well, naturally.

668
01:02:15,808 --> 01:02:18,727
Now, don't be disappointing
and sound like Mr. Burns.

669
01:02:18,811 --> 01:02:20,895
Well, I can only be myself,
Miss Stevens.

670
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:23,690
Then be yourself, John.

671
01:02:23,774 --> 01:02:26,943
- I prefer Conrad.
- You can't be serious.

672
01:02:27,069 --> 01:02:30,280
And I think it's about time
you called me Francie.

673
01:02:30,990 --> 01:02:34,075
I have to look out for Mother. They've
tried to steal her jewelry before.

674
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:37,245
So when I read about the...
You in the paper,

675
01:02:37,330 --> 01:02:41,666
just a small item, but I picked it up,
I was sure Mother would catch your eye.

676
01:02:41,751 --> 01:02:43,835
Well, she did, because I liked her.

677
01:02:44,128 --> 01:02:46,755
- And so far, Miss Stevens...
- Francie.

678
01:02:46,922 --> 01:02:49,966
So far you haven't said anything
that sounds even remotely clever.

679
01:02:50,051 --> 01:02:52,218
Well, stick around.
The next thing I noticed about you

680
01:02:52,303 --> 01:02:54,679
- was something remarkable.
- Yeah?

681
01:02:54,764 --> 01:02:58,391
All evening long, you only looked
at my mother, never at me.

682
01:02:58,601 --> 01:03:01,102
- I kissed you, didn't I?
- I kissed you.

683
01:03:01,854 --> 01:03:03,563
I certainly wasn't
looking at your mother then.

684
01:03:03,648 --> 01:03:04,939
You were thinking about her.

685
01:03:05,024 --> 01:03:07,359
Otherwise you never would have
let me say good night so easily.

686
01:03:07,443 --> 01:03:09,027
Well, I'm a gentleman.

687
01:03:09,278 --> 01:03:12,572
A rough lumberman
from the big Northwest?

688
01:03:12,990 --> 01:03:15,950
I must remember
to yell "timber" occasionally.

689
01:03:17,536 --> 01:03:20,288
Now, here comes
some of the clever part.

690
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:23,375
You're just not convincing, John.

691
01:03:23,459 --> 01:03:26,628
You're like an American character
in an English movie.

692
01:03:26,712 --> 01:03:29,798
You just don't talk the way
an American tourist ought to talk.

693
01:03:29,882 --> 01:03:31,424
Don't you know
that all the guidebooks say,

694
01:03:31,509 --> 01:03:33,176
"Don't behave like a tourist"?

695
01:03:33,260 --> 01:03:36,805
Well, it's just that you never mention
business or baseball or television

696
01:03:36,889 --> 01:03:42,352
- or wage freezes or Senate probes.
- All the things I left America to forget.

697
01:03:42,978 --> 01:03:46,022
You're just not American enough
to carry it off.

698
01:03:46,774 --> 01:03:48,983
Tell me, how long has it been?

699
01:03:49,402 --> 01:03:52,737
- How long has what been?
- Since you were in America last?

700
01:03:52,822 --> 01:03:54,656
I don't know, about four or five days.

701
01:03:54,740 --> 01:03:57,575
- And Oregon?
- Two or three days before that.

702
01:03:57,660 --> 01:04:00,870
Name me three deciduous trees
indigenous to the Northwest.

703
01:04:01,288 --> 01:04:05,500
Now, listen, you're a very nice girl,
but you've got too much imagination.

704
01:04:05,584 --> 01:04:07,085
You go around
talking like that about me,

705
01:04:07,169 --> 01:04:09,379
and I'll wind up in a French jail
for something I didn't do.

706
01:04:09,463 --> 01:04:11,589
Are you going to rob Mother first
or somebody else?

707
01:04:11,674 --> 01:04:13,758
Well, under the circumstances,
somebody else.

708
01:04:13,843 --> 01:04:16,344
- That's nice. Mother likes you.
- Well...

709
01:04:16,429 --> 01:04:19,180
I think Lady Kenton
should be our next job.

710
01:04:19,265 --> 01:04:21,850
- Now, listen...
- Isn't she on your list? She ought to be.

711
01:04:21,934 --> 01:04:25,186
The Kenton jewels are famous.
I know every inch of her villa.

712
01:04:25,271 --> 01:04:28,773
- I can already hear your next line.
- The Cat has a new kitten.

713
01:04:28,858 --> 01:04:31,526
- When do we start?
- Don't talk like that.

714
01:04:32,153 --> 01:04:34,195
You're leaving fingerprints on my arm.

715
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:38,116
- I am not John Robie, the Cat.
- Why are the police following you?

716
01:04:38,868 --> 01:04:40,243
Show me that real estate list.

717
01:04:40,327 --> 01:04:42,537
That villa we went to isn't for rent,
and you know it.

718
01:04:42,621 --> 01:04:46,249
The Sanfords have owned it for years,
and I'm going to a party there in a week.

719
01:04:46,333 --> 01:04:49,961
You have a very strong grip,
the kind a burglar needs.

720
01:05:02,516 --> 01:05:05,351
That's why you came up here, isn't it?

721
01:05:06,771 --> 01:05:10,440
We'll have cocktails at 8:00
and dinner at 8:30, all in my suite.

722
01:05:10,608 --> 01:05:13,943
- We'll talk about it there.
- I can't come.

723
01:05:14,028 --> 01:05:17,113
I'm going to the casino
and to watch a firework display.

724
01:05:17,198 --> 01:05:21,785
- You'll get a better view from my place.
- Already got another date.

725
01:05:22,286 --> 01:05:26,164
Everywhere you go, I'll have you paged
as John Robie, the Cat.

726
01:05:27,666 --> 01:05:30,001
8:00, and be on time.

727
01:05:30,461 --> 01:05:34,506
- I haven't got a decent watch.
- Steal one.

728
01:05:36,675 --> 01:05:40,136
Excuse me. I could not speak
with you today, Monsieur Robie.

729
01:05:40,221 --> 01:05:44,224
- I did not know your new name.
- I figured you'd have had a good reason.

730
01:05:44,350 --> 01:05:46,059
What were you doing
at the Sanford villa, anyway?

731
01:05:46,185 --> 01:05:48,645
I supply food and drinks
for the grand gala.

732
01:05:48,729 --> 01:05:50,897
I was inspecting the kitchen.

733
01:05:51,023 --> 01:05:53,983
I do not ask you
what you were doing there.

734
01:05:54,068 --> 01:05:55,902
You prepare also, no?

735
01:05:55,986 --> 01:05:59,656
There will be many women, rich jewels.

736
01:05:59,740 --> 01:06:01,324
Just the bait I need.

737
01:06:01,408 --> 01:06:03,701
Something the Cat can't resist?

738
01:06:03,911 --> 01:06:07,372
- I suppose all your boys will be there?
- Naturally.

739
01:06:07,540 --> 01:06:10,083
That's nice. You know,
they threatened to put me away.

740
01:06:10,167 --> 01:06:14,254
Robie, they'd be much too busy
to do anything like that.

741
01:06:14,421 --> 01:06:17,340
- Well, you keep them busy.
- Goodbye, Robie.

742
01:06:17,675 --> 01:06:20,426
Who was the pretty American girl?

743
01:06:21,178 --> 01:06:23,513
You bring her
to my restaurant for dinner, yes?

744
01:06:23,597 --> 01:06:26,683
Not tonight. She made
some small plans for the two of us.

745
01:06:26,767 --> 01:06:28,059
Well, soon.

746
01:06:36,443 --> 01:06:37,610
Good night.

747
01:06:39,029 --> 01:06:43,700
If you really want to see fireworks,
it's better with the lights out.

748
01:06:43,784 --> 01:06:45,535
I have a feeling that tonight
you're going to see

749
01:06:45,619 --> 01:06:48,580
one of the Riviera's
most fascinating sights.

750
01:06:49,123 --> 01:06:52,584
- I was talking about the fireworks.
- I never doubted it.

751
01:06:53,043 --> 01:06:56,296
The way you looked at my necklace,
I didn't know.

752
01:06:57,047 --> 01:07:00,383
You've been dying to say something
about it all evening. Go ahead.

753
01:07:00,467 --> 01:07:04,762
- Why, have I been staring at it?
- No, you've been trying to avoid it.

754
01:07:05,139 --> 01:07:06,723
- May I have a brandy?
- Please.

755
01:07:06,807 --> 01:07:09,225
- Would you care for one?
- No, thank you.

756
01:07:11,937 --> 01:07:15,064
Some nights,
a person doesn't need to drink.

757
01:07:16,942 --> 01:07:19,569
Doesn't it make you nervous
to be in the same room

758
01:07:19,653 --> 01:07:22,071
with thousands of dollars' worth
of diamonds

759
01:07:22,156 --> 01:07:24,741
- and unable to touch them?
- No.

760
01:07:26,327 --> 01:07:29,829
Like an alcoholic outside of a bar
on election day.

761
01:07:30,623 --> 01:07:32,582
Wouldn't know the feeling.

762
01:07:32,666 --> 01:07:36,502
All right. You've studied the layout,
drawn your plans,

763
01:07:36,629 --> 01:07:39,088
worked out your timetable,
put on your dark clothes

764
01:07:39,173 --> 01:07:41,507
with your crepe-sole shoes
and your rope,

765
01:07:42,259 --> 01:07:43,927
maybe your face blackened.

766
01:07:44,011 --> 01:07:45,762
And you're over the roofs
in the darkness,

767
01:07:45,846 --> 01:07:48,681
down the side wall
to the right apartment,

768
01:07:48,807 --> 01:07:50,767
and the window's locked.

769
01:07:50,851 --> 01:07:55,104
All that elation turned into frustration.
What would you do?

770
01:07:55,814 --> 01:07:58,024
I'd go home, get a good night's sleep.

771
01:07:58,651 --> 01:08:01,027
What would you do?
The thrill is right there in front of you,

772
01:08:01,153 --> 01:08:03,029
but you can't quite get it.

773
01:08:03,113 --> 01:08:07,116
And the gems glistening
on the other side of the window.

774
01:08:07,201 --> 01:08:10,036
And someone asleep, breathing heavily.

775
01:08:10,621 --> 01:08:12,455
I'd go home, get a good night's sleep.

776
01:08:12,539 --> 01:08:15,124
Wouldn't you use a glass cutter,
a brick, your fist,

777
01:08:15,209 --> 01:08:17,126
anything to get what you wanted,

778
01:08:17,211 --> 01:08:20,046
knowing it was just there
waiting for you?

779
01:08:20,297 --> 01:08:23,967
- No, I wouldn't.
- Drinking dulls your senses.

780
01:08:24,051 --> 01:08:26,636
And, if I'm lucky, some of my hearing.

781
01:08:27,221 --> 01:08:31,724
Blue-white, with just
hair-like touches of platinum.

782
01:08:31,809 --> 01:08:33,809
You know, I have about
the same interest in jewelry

783
01:08:33,852 --> 01:08:36,145
that I have in politics,
horse racing, modern poetry

784
01:08:36,230 --> 01:08:37,647
or women who need weird excitement.

785
01:08:37,731 --> 01:08:38,982
None.

786
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:41,150
Hold this necklace in your hand

787
01:08:41,235 --> 01:08:44,195
and tell me
you're not John Robie, the Cat.

788
01:08:45,197 --> 01:08:47,490
John, tell me something.

789
01:08:47,574 --> 01:08:50,743
You're going to rob that villa
we cased this afternoon, aren't you?

790
01:08:50,869 --> 01:08:54,831
I suppose "rob" is archaic.
You'd say "knock over"?

791
01:08:54,915 --> 01:08:57,667
- For...
- Don't worry. I'm very good at secrets.

792
01:08:57,751 --> 01:09:00,253
Tell me, have you ever been
on a psychiatrist's couch?

793
01:09:00,337 --> 01:09:01,838
Don't change the subject.

794
01:09:01,922 --> 01:09:04,173
I know the perfect time to do it.

795
01:09:04,258 --> 01:09:06,509
Next week, the Sanfords
are holding their annual gala.

796
01:09:06,593 --> 01:09:10,596
Everyone who counts will be there.
I'll get you an invitation.

797
01:09:10,681 --> 01:09:12,682
It's an 18th-century costume affair.

798
01:09:12,766 --> 01:09:14,767
There will be thousands
upon thousands of dollars' worth

799
01:09:14,893 --> 01:09:16,853
of the world's most elegant jewelry.

800
01:09:16,937 --> 01:09:19,272
Some of the guests will be staying
for the weekend.

801
01:09:19,398 --> 01:09:22,525
We'll get all the information and we'll
do it together. What do you say?

802
01:09:22,609 --> 01:09:25,778
My only comment
would be highly censurable.

803
01:09:30,367 --> 01:09:33,036
Give up, John. Admit who you are.

804
01:09:35,622 --> 01:09:39,208
Even in this light, I can tell
where your eyes are looking.

805
01:09:50,637 --> 01:09:53,639
Look, John. Hold them.

806
01:09:54,808 --> 01:09:59,604
Diamonds. The only thing
in the world you can't resist.

807
01:10:00,397 --> 01:10:03,816
Then tell me you don't know
what I'm talking about.

808
01:10:17,998 --> 01:10:20,875
Ever had a better offer
in your whole life?

809
01:10:21,001 --> 01:10:23,044
One with everything?

810
01:10:25,339 --> 01:10:27,507
I've never had a crazier one.

811
01:10:28,675 --> 01:10:31,219
Just as long as you're satisfied.

812
01:10:34,306 --> 01:10:37,809
You know as well as I do
this necklace is imitation.

813
01:10:39,144 --> 01:10:40,686
Well, I'm not.

814
01:11:17,516 --> 01:11:19,350
Give them back to me.

815
01:11:20,686 --> 01:11:22,353
What did you have in mind, Francie?

816
01:11:22,437 --> 01:11:25,189
Give them back to me. Mother's jewels.

817
01:11:26,233 --> 01:11:28,025
I don't have them.

818
01:11:32,573 --> 01:11:35,575
Now tell me...
Wait a minute. Whoa. No, no, no.

819
01:11:38,787 --> 01:11:41,455
- When did it happen?
- When I was asleep.

820
01:11:41,582 --> 01:11:42,623
Well, let's look.

821
01:11:42,749 --> 01:11:45,042
There's only one place to look,
and that's obviously here.

822
01:11:45,127 --> 01:11:46,794
Help yourself.

823
01:11:50,757 --> 01:11:53,801
Did you see Francie?
Did she tell you what happened?

824
01:11:53,927 --> 01:11:56,053
Yes. She's downstairs,
searching my room.

825
01:11:56,138 --> 01:11:58,899
Well, that doesn't make sense. She said
she knew where my jewelry was.

826
01:11:58,932 --> 01:12:00,516
Well, she was wrong.
May I look into your bedroom?

827
01:12:00,601 --> 01:12:02,351
If you think it'll do any good.
But don't you think

828
01:12:02,436 --> 01:12:04,061
we ought to call the police
and the hotel manager?

829
01:12:04,146 --> 01:12:05,897
You know, they always like
to get in on these things.

830
01:12:05,981 --> 01:12:08,024
Yes, but would you let me
look around first, Mrs. Stevens?

831
01:12:08,108 --> 01:12:11,235
I don't care. I'd be just as happy
if you didn't find anything.

832
01:12:11,570 --> 01:12:12,862
Why do you say that?

833
01:12:12,946 --> 01:12:15,364
I'm a little tired
of draping those things over me.

834
01:12:15,449 --> 01:12:16,699
It was exciting at first, but, you know,

835
01:12:16,783 --> 01:12:18,783
now I think it's more exciting
to have them stolen.

836
01:12:18,785 --> 01:12:20,244
Yes, and of course
you can't lose financially

837
01:12:20,329 --> 01:12:22,329
as long as Hughson is around
to make out the check.

838
01:12:22,331 --> 01:12:25,249
Well, I'd be crazy
to take this attitude if I did.

839
01:12:25,834 --> 01:12:28,461
Why on earth did Francie
suspect you, Mr. Burns,

840
01:12:28,921 --> 01:12:31,255
a simple woodcutter from Oregon?

841
01:12:31,340 --> 01:12:33,758
I'm anything but that, Mrs. Stevens.

842
01:12:33,926 --> 01:12:38,638
My real name is John Robie. I used
to be a jewel thief several years ago.

843
01:12:39,139 --> 01:12:41,766
Well, what a wonderful surprise.

844
01:12:42,434 --> 01:12:45,019
Somehow, I can't get worked up over it.

845
01:12:45,437 --> 01:12:49,106
- Where did you keep the stuff?
- In the case over there.

846
01:12:50,108 --> 01:12:53,361
- Watch out for fingerprints.
- There won't be any.

847
01:12:55,489 --> 01:12:58,491
- Now, did they get everything?
- Everything.

848
01:12:59,701 --> 01:13:02,161
Francie must have known about you
all along.

849
01:13:02,287 --> 01:13:05,831
She guessed today.
You must sleep soundly.

850
01:13:06,959 --> 01:13:08,459
I do.

851
01:13:11,505 --> 01:13:14,090
He came down through the air shaft.

852
01:13:14,174 --> 01:13:18,261
If you're not Mr. Burns from Oregon,
why do you call yourself that and not...

853
01:13:18,345 --> 01:13:21,347
- What was the other name?
- Robie. John Robie.

854
01:13:21,473 --> 01:13:23,140
- Mrs. Stevens...
- I know the whole story.

855
01:13:23,225 --> 01:13:25,059
You want to go straight,
but the gang won't let you.

856
01:13:25,185 --> 01:13:28,980
- Well, in this case, the gang is the law.
- Mother, don't talk to him.

857
01:13:29,856 --> 01:13:32,441
Don't touch anything.
You're not going to cover up any clues.

858
01:13:32,526 --> 01:13:35,236
But there aren't any clues to cover up.
He came down the air shaft,

859
01:13:35,362 --> 01:13:37,405
took the stones
and went away the same way.

860
01:13:37,531 --> 01:13:39,949
You know how he got in here
as well as I do.

861
01:13:40,033 --> 01:13:42,827
- Did you find anything in my room?
- I certainly did.

862
01:13:43,036 --> 01:13:46,205
- Nothing of your mother's.
- No, you gave those to your accomplice.

863
01:13:46,331 --> 01:13:49,667
But I did find that the clothes
of Mr. Burns, the American,

864
01:13:49,751 --> 01:13:53,379
all had French labels in them,
and I found this.

865
01:13:53,505 --> 01:13:56,340
A list of everyone on the Riviera
with jewelry worth stealing.

866
01:13:56,425 --> 01:13:58,759
Listen to what it says about us.

867
01:13:58,927 --> 01:14:02,763
What good is that going to do you?
You're already caught.

868
01:14:02,889 --> 01:14:05,249
I called the police from your room
and told them who you are

869
01:14:05,350 --> 01:14:06,851
and what you did tonight.

870
01:14:07,060 --> 01:14:11,355
Everything? The boys must have
enjoyed that down at headquarters.

871
01:14:12,607 --> 01:14:13,767
Mother, his name isn't Burns.

872
01:14:13,859 --> 01:14:16,360
He's a notorious jewel thief
called the Cat.

873
01:14:17,112 --> 01:14:21,657
And what's he doing here now, lamb,
if he already has got the junk?

874
01:14:21,742 --> 01:14:24,160
Returning to the scene of his crime.

875
01:14:24,244 --> 01:14:26,245
Since when is love a crime?

876
01:14:27,414 --> 01:14:30,166
His name is Robie,
and for my money he's a real man,

877
01:14:30,250 --> 01:14:32,335
not one of those milksops
you generally take up with.

878
01:14:32,419 --> 01:14:35,254
- Mother, after all...
- After all, my foot.

879
01:14:36,631 --> 01:14:39,383
Why do you think
we moved so many times?

880
01:14:39,593 --> 01:14:43,220
Your father was a swindler, dear,
but a lovable one.

881
01:14:43,305 --> 01:14:46,223
You ask me, this one's
a bigger operator on every level.

882
01:14:46,308 --> 01:14:48,184
- Thank you, madame.
- Mother, this is why

883
01:14:48,268 --> 01:14:51,270
I've had to spend half my life
traveling around the world after you,

884
01:14:51,396 --> 01:14:53,022
to keep men like this away from you.

885
01:14:53,106 --> 01:14:55,026
Well, after this,
let me run my own interference.

886
01:14:55,067 --> 01:14:57,610
Looks like the blockers
are having all the fun.

887
01:14:57,736 --> 01:15:00,404
Well, if she doesn't have
any common sense, I do.

888
01:15:00,489 --> 01:15:01,697
Shut up.

889
01:15:01,782 --> 01:15:03,491
They were my baubles that were stolen.

890
01:15:03,617 --> 01:15:06,452
If I don't care, why should you?
They're insured.

891
01:15:06,912 --> 01:15:09,413
Now, the big question is,
where do we go from here?

892
01:15:12,125 --> 01:15:13,584
To jail.

893
01:15:29,976 --> 01:15:31,477
Where is he?

894
01:15:31,812 --> 01:15:33,896
- Who?
- John Robie.

895
01:15:33,980 --> 01:15:35,689
Never heard of him.

896
01:15:39,986 --> 01:15:42,988
Mother, the book you're reading
is upside down.

897
01:15:54,584 --> 01:15:56,425
We may be in France,
but I'm still an American,

898
01:15:56,503 --> 01:15:58,879
and a man is innocent
until he's proved guilty.

899
01:15:59,005 --> 01:16:00,840
- Proved.
- That won't be hard.

900
01:16:00,924 --> 01:16:02,884
What's bothering you
is John Robie's the first man

901
01:16:03,009 --> 01:16:05,052
who wouldn't fall down
and roll over for you.

902
01:16:05,178 --> 01:16:07,972
Mother, he played us both for fools,
and you know it.

903
01:16:08,056 --> 01:16:09,932
I know you ought to be spanked
with a hairbrush

904
01:16:10,016 --> 01:16:11,809
and sent back to school, public school,

905
01:16:11,893 --> 01:16:14,134
where they could pound some sense
into you during recess.

906
01:16:14,187 --> 01:16:18,399
- He's a low, worthless thief.
- Just what did he steal from you?

907
01:16:18,942 --> 01:16:20,526
Mother!

908
01:16:20,610 --> 01:16:24,280
Sit down while I tell you something
about life and John Robie.

909
01:16:24,364 --> 01:16:26,282
Sit down before I knock you down.

910
01:16:48,972 --> 01:16:51,307
So for three days
you've been doing nothing but fishing.

911
01:16:51,391 --> 01:16:55,978
Keep it down. Do you still believe
I did the Stevens job?

912
01:16:56,229 --> 01:16:58,939
Well, I... Yes, until you sent for me.

913
01:16:59,065 --> 01:17:01,650
If you had done it, you'd hardly
risk my bringing the police with me.

914
01:17:01,735 --> 01:17:02,818
Thank you.

915
01:17:02,986 --> 01:17:05,112
As you've been safely in hiding
for several days,

916
01:17:05,238 --> 01:17:06,559
why did you come out in the open?

917
01:17:06,615 --> 01:17:09,825
- I need your help.
- Perhaps I need yours even more.

918
01:17:09,910 --> 01:17:12,036
You see, my superiors
at the London office...

919
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:15,664
Well, this time I might solve some
of your problems, possibly all of them.

920
01:17:15,749 --> 01:17:17,208
That's too much to hope for.

921
01:17:17,292 --> 01:17:20,085
For three nights, I've been watching
one of the villas on your list.

922
01:17:20,170 --> 01:17:21,462
- Which one?
- The Silvas',

923
01:17:21,588 --> 01:17:22,838
that South American couple.

924
01:17:22,923 --> 01:17:25,466
Somebody else is watching it, too.
I've seen him in the dark,

925
01:17:25,592 --> 01:17:26,884
but I haven't managed
to get close enough

926
01:17:26,968 --> 01:17:28,529
to catch him and to find out who it is.

927
01:17:28,595 --> 01:17:30,763
- Has he seen you?
- Probably.

928
01:17:30,847 --> 01:17:32,973
I want to set a foolproof trap
for him tonight.

929
01:17:33,099 --> 01:17:35,476
To do that, I'm going to need
the assistance of the police.

930
01:17:35,602 --> 01:17:37,603
Naturally, I can't approach them.

931
01:17:37,687 --> 01:17:39,772
Well, how do you know
he'll be there tonight?

932
01:17:39,856 --> 01:17:42,858
Somebody gave this to Germaine,
my housekeeper.

933
01:17:45,153 --> 01:17:46,987
But it's in French. What does it say?

934
01:17:47,113 --> 01:17:50,032
Roughly, it says, "Robie, stay away
from the Silvas' villa tonight."

935
01:17:50,116 --> 01:17:52,201
"it's my night to yowl, not yours."

936
01:17:52,327 --> 01:17:55,454
- Who gave it to Germaine?
- It was left in her shopping basket.

937
01:17:56,623 --> 01:17:59,291
Look, Hughson,
get back to town and convince Lepic

938
01:17:59,376 --> 01:18:02,628
to have the police at the villa
soon after midnight.

939
01:18:02,879 --> 01:18:05,005
- You're actually going there?
- Of course.

940
01:18:05,131 --> 01:18:07,675
But, Robie, that note
is obviously bait for a trap.

941
01:18:07,801 --> 01:18:09,843
Someone wants you
to go to the Silvas' tonight.

942
01:18:09,970 --> 01:18:12,513
- I know it.
- Possibly to kill you.

943
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:16,475
- Will you talk to Lepic?
- All right,

944
01:18:16,810 --> 01:18:20,396
but, look, if this Cat doesn't show up,
the police might get you,

945
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:23,148
and the whole thing
will turn out rather badly.

946
01:18:23,650 --> 01:18:26,527
No, maybe I'd better
go along tonight as your alibi.

947
01:18:26,653 --> 01:18:29,113
Hughson, I know you get
your insurance rates at a discount,

948
01:18:29,197 --> 01:18:31,031
but why be foolhardy?

949
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:36,532
Almost everybody in Philadelphia
reads The Bulletin.

950
01:20:36,616 --> 01:20:38,450
Just a minute, Mother.

951
01:20:46,459 --> 01:20:50,504
- What is it? What's all the excitement?
- The cat burglar's dead.

952
01:20:50,797 --> 01:20:54,341
- John Robie?
- No, a man named Foussard,

953
01:20:54,467 --> 01:20:56,635
a wine steward in a restaurant.

954
01:20:57,137 --> 01:21:01,348
Honey, you better start practicing
your apologies in two languages.

955
01:21:04,519 --> 01:21:07,020
You are positive Foussard was the Cat?

956
01:21:07,147 --> 01:21:10,190
We have no reason to change
the story I gave to the newspaper.

957
01:21:10,275 --> 01:21:12,443
Well, that's hardly
a direct answer, Commissioner.

958
01:21:12,527 --> 01:21:15,779
I cannot give you another.
Now, if you'll excuse me...

959
01:21:15,864 --> 01:21:20,033
One more point, Monsieur Lepic.
This is a check for $280,000.

960
01:21:20,368 --> 01:21:22,661
That's nearly 92 million francs.

961
01:21:22,954 --> 01:21:25,539
Now, since you caught
and unfortunately killed the Cat...

962
01:21:25,623 --> 01:21:28,333
In our opinion, he killed himself
attempting to escape justice.

963
01:21:28,418 --> 01:21:30,586
Yeah, well, either way,
I've been instructed by my company

964
01:21:30,670 --> 01:21:32,629
to pay off the Stevens' claim.

965
01:21:32,714 --> 01:21:36,633
Now, I'm disinclined to do this
if recovery of the jewelry is imminent.

966
01:21:36,801 --> 01:21:37,843
Is it?

967
01:21:37,927 --> 01:21:41,638
- It will take time.
- I'd say several centuries.

968
01:21:43,016 --> 01:21:47,102
I just came in to congratulate you
on your capture, Commissaire.

969
01:21:49,272 --> 01:21:51,106
All's well that ends well?

970
01:21:52,317 --> 01:21:55,944
Yes, newspapers have their headlines,
all the rich tourists can relax,

971
01:21:56,029 --> 01:21:57,654
and you, Lepic, got your publicity

972
01:21:57,739 --> 01:21:59,990
and possibly a commendation
from the Paris office.

973
01:22:00,074 --> 01:22:02,034
Almost everyone
got some good out of it.

974
01:22:02,118 --> 01:22:04,244
Except, of course,
Hughson's company.

975
01:22:04,329 --> 01:22:06,371
But then, they can well afford it,
can't they, Hughson?

976
01:22:06,456 --> 01:22:08,665
Well, it has cut into their assets.

977
01:22:09,542 --> 01:22:12,211
Poor Foussard.
Never guessed it was him.

978
01:22:12,295 --> 01:22:16,590
Ordinary wine waiter.
Family man. Wooden leg.

979
01:22:19,969 --> 01:22:24,014
Didn't you know?
Why, certainly. He lost it during the war.

980
01:22:24,432 --> 01:22:26,016
You know, that's remarkable, isn't it?

981
01:22:26,100 --> 01:22:28,685
A man with a wooden leg
teaching himself to climb up walls

982
01:22:28,770 --> 01:22:32,064
and to run over the roof
with the agility of a four-footed cat.

983
01:22:32,190 --> 01:22:35,651
- Is that true?
- I believe he had a bad leg.

984
01:22:35,777 --> 01:22:39,279
Yes, you showed such good taste
in keeping it out of the newspapers.

985
01:22:40,073 --> 01:22:42,783
Well, I think it only fitting
that I drop into Foussard's funeral,

986
01:22:42,867 --> 01:22:44,201
pay my last respects.

987
01:22:44,285 --> 01:22:46,745
And at the same time
get a look at the real Cat,

988
01:22:46,830 --> 01:22:49,248
who will certainly be there purring.

989
01:22:49,582 --> 01:22:53,252
- You know who the real Cat is?
- In a phrase, I do.

990
01:22:53,336 --> 01:22:56,630
- Well, tell the Commissioner who it is.
- He wouldn't believe me.

991
01:22:56,714 --> 01:23:00,050
- Well, then try me.
- You'd find it hard to believe.

992
01:23:00,510 --> 01:23:03,804
But when I catch the Cat on a rooftop
with a handful of stolen diamonds...

993
01:23:03,888 --> 01:23:07,432
Monsieur Robie, it's because
I gave this story to the newspapers

994
01:23:07,517 --> 01:23:08,767
you're at liberty.

995
01:23:08,852 --> 01:23:13,063
But the day I catch you on a roof,
I'll call the reporters again.

996
01:23:13,189 --> 01:23:15,148
Lepic, that's all I wanted to know.

997
01:23:15,233 --> 01:23:16,650
Good day.

998
01:24:06,826 --> 01:24:09,828
A most unhappy affair, Robie?

999
01:24:10,455 --> 01:24:13,165
Unhappy because it isn't me
down there?

1000
01:24:15,501 --> 01:24:16,919
Poor Danielle.

1001
01:24:17,712 --> 01:24:20,213
I have a great compassion for her.

1002
01:24:21,341 --> 01:24:23,175
I'll look out for her.

1003
01:24:24,469 --> 01:24:27,179
What do you suppose happened
to all the stuff he stole?

1004
01:24:27,347 --> 01:24:29,139
That's a mystery.

1005
01:24:29,515 --> 01:24:32,059
The police have looked in every place.

1006
01:24:32,602 --> 01:24:34,519
Someday it'll turn up.

1007
01:24:34,687 --> 01:24:38,357
- The boys owe you many thanks.
- For what?

1008
01:24:38,691 --> 01:24:42,361
You know, for risking the prison
to capture the Cat.

1009
01:24:43,029 --> 01:24:44,821
That.

1010
01:24:45,406 --> 01:24:49,201
But you, you have no reason
to complain?

1011
01:24:50,161 --> 01:24:52,579
Could you be a little more specific?

1012
01:24:53,081 --> 01:24:55,832
The American girl... What's her name?

1013
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:59,211
Francie Stevens. That the one?

1014
01:25:00,129 --> 01:25:01,463
What luck.

1015
01:25:02,090 --> 01:25:08,387
A beautiful woman with love for you,
rich beyond your dreams.

1016
01:25:08,930 --> 01:25:10,722
I dream pretty rich.

1017
01:25:10,848 --> 01:25:14,726
- When are you going to America?
- I didn't know I was.

1018
01:25:16,312 --> 01:25:20,482
You will make a great mistake
if you don't marry her

1019
01:25:20,650 --> 01:25:23,193
and return to your native country.

1020
01:25:23,987 --> 01:25:28,281
Tell you what. Let's talk about it
at the Sanford gala over the weekend,

1021
01:25:28,366 --> 01:25:30,701
you know, between your catering duties.

1022
01:25:30,785 --> 01:25:33,954
- You are not invited.
- I will be.

1023
01:25:35,873 --> 01:25:38,000
What costume will you wear?

1024
01:25:38,584 --> 01:25:41,253
I'll figure out something to surprise you.

1025
01:25:42,714 --> 01:25:44,214
Good luck.

1026
01:25:57,395 --> 01:25:58,603
Killer!

1027
01:25:59,355 --> 01:26:00,939
It's because of you he's dead.

1028
01:26:07,113 --> 01:26:08,363
Get out!

1029
01:26:09,073 --> 01:26:11,366
Get out of here, killer.

1030
01:26:12,452 --> 01:26:13,785
Murderer!

1031
01:26:40,897 --> 01:26:42,147
John?

1032
01:26:49,322 --> 01:26:50,489
John.

1033
01:27:10,176 --> 01:27:12,803
Are you going to make it hard
for me to apologize?

1034
01:27:12,887 --> 01:27:16,098
- Not at all. I'm sure you're sorry.
- You know I am.

1035
01:27:16,849 --> 01:27:19,810
Till Mother told me, I had no idea
of the things you were up against.

1036
01:27:19,894 --> 01:27:21,269
Yeah, well...

1037
01:27:22,146 --> 01:27:24,147
What are your plans now?

1038
01:27:24,565 --> 01:27:27,359
- Now what?
- That the cat burglar's dead.

1039
01:27:27,443 --> 01:27:29,778
- Foussard isn't the Cat.
- But the newspapers...

1040
01:27:29,862 --> 01:27:31,446
The man had a wooden leg.

1041
01:27:31,531 --> 01:27:33,990
Wasn't he caught at a villa
trying to rob it?

1042
01:27:34,075 --> 01:27:37,160
He wasn't trying to rob it.
He was trying to kill me.

1043
01:27:37,245 --> 01:27:38,328
Why?

1044
01:27:38,412 --> 01:27:40,205
Because I was getting
too close to the Cat.

1045
01:27:40,289 --> 01:27:44,626
- Well, then who killed him?
- If I ever find that out, I'll let you know.

1046
01:27:44,710 --> 01:27:47,963
- Goodbye, Francie.
- John, why bother?

1047
01:27:49,340 --> 01:27:52,008
You know, it's sort of a hobby of mine,
the truth.

1048
01:27:52,385 --> 01:27:54,886
- Let me do something to help you.
- No, thanks.

1049
01:27:54,971 --> 01:27:56,451
Now, you've just made your apologies.

1050
01:27:56,472 --> 01:27:59,641
Let's go back to our mutual disregard
of each other.

1051
01:28:00,268 --> 01:28:03,895
Mr. Robie,
I was wrong about you, I think.

1052
01:28:04,397 --> 01:28:06,940
You might possibly be wrong about me.

1053
01:28:07,900 --> 01:28:10,020
Well, now, that's another thing
that I may never know.

1054
01:28:10,069 --> 01:28:11,153
Now if you'll pardon me,

1055
01:28:11,237 --> 01:28:13,405
- I have a bus to catch.
- I won't pardon you.

1056
01:28:15,658 --> 01:28:17,576
I'm in love with you.

1057
01:28:22,039 --> 01:28:26,376
- Well, that's a ridiculous thing to say.
- Is it?

1058
01:28:27,295 --> 01:28:30,755
You know, to you,
words are just playthings.

1059
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:32,424
Were playthings.

1060
01:28:35,136 --> 01:28:38,013
I'll make you a sporting, exciting offer.

1061
01:28:39,807 --> 01:28:41,933
I don't know if I'm up to it now.

1062
01:28:42,393 --> 01:28:45,770
Get me an invitation
to the Sanford gala. I'll take you there.

1063
01:28:45,855 --> 01:28:48,857
It's costume, you know.
You can't go without a costume.

1064
01:28:48,941 --> 01:28:50,942
- What are you wearing?
- Louis XV.

1065
01:28:51,027 --> 01:28:53,987
Mother and I got them in Paris.

1066
01:28:55,865 --> 01:28:58,116
I'll phone you in a day or two.

1067
01:28:59,118 --> 01:29:02,204
You probably wonder
why I want to go?

1068
01:29:02,455 --> 01:29:03,705
I have an idea.

1069
01:29:03,789 --> 01:29:07,751
I thought you might like to see
a real, live burglar in action.

1070
01:29:08,961 --> 01:29:10,795
Will it be dangerous?

1071
01:29:12,340 --> 01:29:13,965
Not for tourists.

1072
01:32:07,973 --> 01:32:09,724
Well, we're in.

1073
01:32:09,809 --> 01:32:12,769
Any man without a lady on his arm
can only be a policeman.

1074
01:32:13,396 --> 01:32:15,605
My nerves could stand a drink.

1075
01:32:15,898 --> 01:32:18,066
Your nerves and your mother.

1076
01:32:56,814 --> 01:32:57,856
There they are.

1077
01:32:57,940 --> 01:33:00,525
Police Commissioner Lepic
and one of his men.

1078
01:33:00,651 --> 01:33:02,861
Wigs, pantaloons and flat feet.

1079
01:33:03,362 --> 01:33:04,696
Come on.

1080
01:33:10,786 --> 01:33:12,537
My heart pills.

1081
01:33:12,621 --> 01:33:14,122
I can't drink champagne
without my pills.

1082
01:33:14,206 --> 01:33:15,290
It gives me heartburn.

1083
01:33:15,374 --> 01:33:17,208
Where do you think
you left them, Mother?

1084
01:33:17,334 --> 01:33:19,961
Upstairs in our room.
They're in my purse.

1085
01:33:20,045 --> 01:33:22,380
Would you be a sweetie, John,
and go and get them for me?

1086
01:33:22,506 --> 01:33:24,549
Of course. I'd be delighted.

1087
01:33:25,384 --> 01:33:27,969
- Mother.
- Well, all I said was...

1088
01:33:28,053 --> 01:33:30,013
Never mind what you said.

1089
01:34:34,078 --> 01:34:35,787
Thank you, dear.

1090
01:34:39,708 --> 01:34:41,292
Shall we dance?

1091
01:38:19,011 --> 01:38:23,055
Well, I hope the London office
appreciate what I've done for them.

1092
01:38:23,849 --> 01:38:25,725
My feet are killing me.

1093
01:38:26,518 --> 01:38:28,227
Mother was quite a little actress tonight.

1094
01:38:28,353 --> 01:38:31,856
Yes, I thought she played her part
rather well. "Heart pills."

1095
01:38:34,026 --> 01:38:38,029
Frankly, I didn't believe this scheme
of yours would work, Francie, but it has.

1096
01:41:27,699 --> 01:41:29,617
I figured it was you
the night your father died.

1097
01:41:29,701 --> 01:41:30,782
He couldn't climb anything,

1098
01:41:30,869 --> 01:41:32,161
and you always did his legwork for him,

1099
01:41:32,245 --> 01:41:33,871
even during the war
when you were a kid.

1100
01:41:33,997 --> 01:41:35,915
Come down, Robie!

1101
01:41:49,262 --> 01:41:52,181
Come down, Robie,
or we shall be forced to shoot.

1102
01:42:27,092 --> 01:42:28,718
Put that gun down. He's not the Cat.

1103
01:42:28,802 --> 01:42:31,523
- Then what does he do on that roof?
- Your job. That's what he's doing.

1104
01:42:31,596 --> 01:42:34,306
- Madame, I can only believe what I see.
- You shoot him and I'll...

1105
01:42:34,433 --> 01:42:37,101
John Robie is just where
I knew he'd be someday.

1106
01:42:52,701 --> 01:42:54,452
He's not alone up there.

1107
01:43:36,244 --> 01:43:37,495
Pull me up!

1108
01:43:39,706 --> 01:43:42,291
Don't shout. it makes me nervous.
I might drop you.

1109
01:43:42,375 --> 01:43:43,876
- Then drop me.
- Whatever you say.

1110
01:43:44,002 --> 01:43:45,336
No!

1111
01:43:45,420 --> 01:43:47,088
All right, now,
you've got a full house down there.

1112
01:43:47,172 --> 01:43:49,340
- Begin the performance.
- What performance?

1113
01:43:49,424 --> 01:43:50,985
You know,
the one in which you tell them

1114
01:43:51,009 --> 01:43:52,468
what is what and who is really who.

1115
01:43:52,552 --> 01:43:54,762
But, please, John, I might slip.

1116
01:43:54,846 --> 01:43:57,890
I figure I can hold you
for about 30 seconds, no more.

1117
01:43:58,016 --> 01:43:59,809
I did it for my father.

1118
01:43:59,893 --> 01:44:01,602
That's fine, but I already know it.

1119
01:44:01,686 --> 01:44:03,562
We're telling them down there,
remember?

1120
01:44:03,688 --> 01:44:05,856
I'll kill you when I get up there.

1121
01:44:05,941 --> 01:44:08,192
If you get up here. Tell them.

1122
01:44:08,527 --> 01:44:12,071
I was working for my father!
Now, please...

1123
01:44:12,197 --> 01:44:14,990
Your father is conveniently dead.
Who else?

1124
01:44:15,075 --> 01:44:16,117
That's all.

1125
01:44:16,201 --> 01:44:18,452
You know, I'm out of training.
My fingers are beginning to open.

1126
01:44:18,537 --> 01:44:20,621
Tell them who was behind it,
who engineered the whole thing,

1127
01:44:20,705 --> 01:44:22,873
who knew as much about me
as I knew myself.

1128
01:44:23,375 --> 01:44:24,792
Go on! Go on!

1129
01:44:26,086 --> 01:44:28,921
Bertani. Bertani's was behind it.

1130
01:44:29,047 --> 01:44:30,297
We're telling them
down there, remember?

1131
01:44:30,382 --> 01:44:32,383
Bertani's was behind it!

1132
01:44:32,467 --> 01:44:35,052
- That's right.
- No! Please, please.

1133
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,126
- Who brought you up here?
- The police.

1134
01:45:07,252 --> 01:45:09,962
And we would have caught you, too,
if my dress hadn't gotten caught

1135
01:45:10,088 --> 01:45:12,298
all over the steering wheel
and gearshift.

1136
01:45:12,424 --> 01:45:14,133
It was only 20 minutes ago
I said goodbye.

1137
01:45:14,259 --> 01:45:15,676
As quickly as you could.

1138
01:45:15,760 --> 01:45:17,344
- Didn't I thank you?
- Politely.

1139
01:45:17,429 --> 01:45:18,512
Well, then...

1140
01:45:18,597 --> 01:45:21,140
John, you left in such a hurry,
you almost ran.

1141
01:45:21,266 --> 01:45:23,184
I had work to do up here.

1142
01:45:23,310 --> 01:45:27,354
Were you afraid to admit that you just
can't do everything by yourself,

1143
01:45:27,772 --> 01:45:30,608
and that you needed the help
of a good woman,

1144
01:45:31,026 --> 01:45:34,028
and you just aren't the lone wolf
you think you are?

1145
01:45:34,112 --> 01:45:36,780
All right.
Without you, I couldn't have done it.

1146
01:45:36,948 --> 01:45:39,033
I needed the help of a woman.

1147
01:45:39,701 --> 01:45:43,204
I guess I'm not the lone wolf
I thought I was, Francie.

1148
01:45:45,165 --> 01:45:48,083
Well, I just wanted to hear you say that.

1149
01:45:49,294 --> 01:45:50,628
Thank you.

1150
01:45:52,923 --> 01:45:54,965
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1151
01:46:08,813 --> 01:46:11,273
So this is where you live.

1152
01:46:11,358 --> 01:46:14,026
Mother will love it up here.
