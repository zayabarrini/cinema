1
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,411
(Man) When I was a lad,

2
00:02:17,673 --> 00:02:22,747
a journey on the rivers of England
was a truly blithe experience.

3
00:02:23,139 --> 00:02:26,575
"Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive,"

4
00:02:26,894 --> 00:02:28,725
as Wordsworth has it.

5
00:02:28,981 --> 00:02:31,290
Brook lime and flag iris,

6
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:35,641
plantain and marsh marigolds
rioted on the banks.

7
00:02:35,991 --> 00:02:40,189
And kingfishers swooped and darted about,

8
00:02:40,539 --> 00:02:43,178
their shadows racing over the brown trout.

9
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:46,020
<i>Well, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

10
00:02:46,297 --> 00:02:47,650
<i>I'm happy to be able to tell you</i>

11
00:02:47,884 --> 00:02:49,875
that these ravishing sights

12
00:02:50,135 --> 00:02:52,808
will be restored to us again
in the near future,

13
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:55,090
<i>thanks to the diligent efforts
of your government</i>

14
00:02:55,352 --> 00:02:57,343
<i>and your local authority,</i>

15
00:02:57,604 --> 00:03:02,234
all the water above this point
will soon be clear.

16
00:03:02,611 --> 00:03:04,647
Clear of industrial effluent.

17
00:03:04,907 --> 00:03:06,738
<i>Clear of detergents.</i>

18
00:03:06,995 --> 00:03:09,987
Clear of the waste products of our society,

19
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:15,683
with which for so long we have
poisoned our rivers and canals.

20
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:18,750
<i>Let us rejoice</i>

21
00:03:19,012 --> 00:03:23,164
that pollution will soon be banished
from the waters of this river,

22
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,271
and that there will soon be no -

23
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:28,516
- Look!
- What is it?

24
00:03:30,736 --> 00:03:32,294
It's a woman!

25
00:03:41,501 --> 00:03:43,492
What's that 'round her neck?

26
00:03:45,591 --> 00:03:47,104
She's been strangled!

27
00:03:47,343 --> 00:03:50,938
<i>- Looks like a tie.
- Yes, it's a tie, alright.</i>

28
00:03:51,265 --> 00:03:53,381
Another necktie murder.

29
00:03:53,643 --> 00:03:55,634
Come on. Move out of the way.

30
00:03:55,897 --> 00:03:58,365
Please come away from here, Sir George.

31
00:04:01,613 --> 00:04:04,969
- It's another necktie murder.
- What are the police doing about it?

32
00:04:05,284 --> 00:04:07,798
- Why can't they find him?
- He's a regular Jack the Ripper.

33
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,991
Not on your life. He used to carve 'em up.

34
00:04:10,249 --> 00:04:13,639
Sent a bird's kidney to Scotland Yard,
wrapped in writing paper.

35
00:04:13,964 --> 00:04:16,683
That'll do. I'm sure the lady
doesn't want to hear more.

36
00:04:16,968 --> 00:04:18,242
Or was it a bit of her liver?

37
00:04:20,015 --> 00:04:23,132
I say, it's not my club tie, is it?

38
00:04:57,987 --> 00:05:00,182
<i>(Man) Cheers, Squadron Leader.</i>

39
00:05:01,032 --> 00:05:03,592
<i>- Chin, chin.
- Good morning.</i>

40
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,531
It may come as something
of a surprise to you, Blaney,

41
00:05:06,789 --> 00:05:09,701
but in this pub we sell liquor,
we don't give it away.

42
00:05:10,003 --> 00:05:12,278
Still less do we expect
our employees to steal it.

43
00:05:12,547 --> 00:05:13,900
I was going to pay for it.

44
00:05:14,134 --> 00:05:17,251
Yeah, I'm sure you were. Get out.

45
00:05:17,554 --> 00:05:20,705
I told you I was going to pay for it.
I always pay for my drinks.

46
00:05:21,019 --> 00:05:23,010
Even for your watered-down gin.

47
00:05:23,272 --> 00:05:25,740
<i>Don't come the innocent
with me, you bastard!</i>

48
00:05:26,024 --> 00:05:27,582
My stocks have been
well down this past month.

49
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:28,809
Watch what you're saying!

50
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:32,102
- What, you're a thief?
- What's going on?

51
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:35,288
<i>Our friend here says that
I've been pinching his booze.</i>

52
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,889
- Ridiculous! He always pays.
- How would you know?

53
00:05:38,167 --> 00:05:40,476
- I work with him, don't I?
- And what else?

54
00:05:40,756 --> 00:05:44,066
- What's that mean?
- Keep out of this. Blaney, outside.

55
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:46,660
<i>- You're fired.
- He never stole nothing in his life.</i>

56
00:05:46,932 --> 00:05:48,445
He puts the money in the till.
I've seen him.

57
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:52,595
A thief or a boozer,
I don't need either one as a barman,

58
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:56,535
And he's usually pulling your tits
instead of pulling pints.

59
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,249
He can't keep his hands off you,
so the customers say.

60
00:05:59,534 --> 00:06:01,729
What about you? Always fingering me.

61
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:04,383
Keep your lying mouth shut,
Babs, or you can get out as well.

62
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:07,940
I'm off. Keep the change!

63
00:06:14,053 --> 00:06:16,044
I'll send for my things later.

64
00:06:16,305 --> 00:06:17,863
Just a minute!

65
00:06:18,101 --> 00:06:21,218
There's a little matter of ten pounds
I advanced you on your salary.

66
00:06:21,522 --> 00:06:24,719
Are you planning to steal that as well?

67
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:28,291
There you are.

68
00:06:28,532 --> 00:06:30,841
You know what to do with them.

69
00:06:36,501 --> 00:06:39,413
- Don't let him talk to you like that.
- I know.

70
00:06:39,715 --> 00:06:43,185
- What are you gonna do, luv?
- I don't know.

71
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:46,866
- Another pub perhaps.
- Are you alright?

72
00:06:47,182 --> 00:06:50,015
- You just gave him back that tenner.
- I had to.

73
00:06:50,311 --> 00:06:53,542
He didn't think I had it.
Don't worry, I've got a bit left.

74
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,976
This is Covent Garden,
not the garden of love.

75
00:06:56,236 --> 00:06:57,635
How 'bout starting work?

76
00:06:57,864 --> 00:07:01,095
Oh, get stuffed!

77
00:07:02,915 --> 00:07:05,907
- Look after yourself.
- I'll call you.

78
00:07:16,016 --> 00:07:18,007
Thanks, guv.

79
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:03,561
- Hello, Dick.
- Hello, Bob.

80
00:08:03,793 --> 00:08:05,704
I was just coming over for a quick one.

81
00:08:05,963 --> 00:08:08,113
Why aren't you back there polishing
the sausages or watering the gin,

82
00:08:08,382 --> 00:08:11,658
or whatever it is you do there
before opening time?

83
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:15,042
I have just been given the push.

84
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:18,786
What for? You weren't pissing
in the beer again?

85
00:08:19,106 --> 00:08:22,462
- Forsythe and I had a set-to.
- Oh, him.

86
00:08:22,778 --> 00:08:27,374
- You duffed him up I hope.
- He's a bastard.

87
00:08:27,744 --> 00:08:30,178
He was on my back right from the start.

88
00:08:30,456 --> 00:08:33,414
From squadron leader to barman
in one easy lesson!

89
00:08:34,378 --> 00:08:36,289
He's the boss' brother-in-law,
isn't he, Forsythe?

90
00:08:36,547 --> 00:08:37,866
I think so.

91
00:08:38,092 --> 00:08:40,208
Brother-in-laws are the worst.

92
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:42,664
Or should I say, "brothers-in-law"?

93
00:08:45,102 --> 00:08:48,697
- What are you gonna do now?
- I haven't decided yet.

94
00:08:49,022 --> 00:08:52,094
Well, if you're in "schtuk,"
you know where to come.

95
00:08:52,402 --> 00:08:53,721
Thanks.

96
00:08:53,946 --> 00:08:55,743
George!

97
00:08:55,992 --> 00:08:59,871
- That's the last one.
- Thanks, Mr Rusk.

98
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:05,840
Why don't you go and see your ex?
She's doin' alright, isn't she?

99
00:09:06,173 --> 00:09:08,164
I haven't seen her for ages, as you know.

100
00:09:08,427 --> 00:09:11,578
- There's no use reopening all that.
- No, I suppose not.

101
00:09:11,889 --> 00:09:16,440
Well, as I say,
you can always rely on me.

102
00:09:16,813 --> 00:09:19,122
- You're alright for a few quid?
- Yes. Thanks all the same.

103
00:09:19,401 --> 00:09:22,757
- Cos if you're not...
- No, no. Really. I just got paid.

104
00:09:23,071 --> 00:09:25,062
Well... have some grapes.

105
00:09:25,325 --> 00:09:28,044
Here you are. I'll get you a box.

106
00:09:32,377 --> 00:09:35,130
Finest muscats, fresh in this morning.

107
00:09:35,423 --> 00:09:38,062
Take one of these back
to your girlfriend, Babs.

108
00:09:38,346 --> 00:09:41,861
Get her to peel you one.
"Beulah, peel me a grape."

109
00:09:42,183 --> 00:09:44,651
That's what my ol' mum used to say
when I was a kid.

110
00:09:44,937 --> 00:09:47,576
At least you won't starve to death.

111
00:09:49,568 --> 00:09:52,719
- Are you sure you don't need cash?
- No, I'm OK.

112
00:09:53,616 --> 00:09:57,894
Well, you don't look OK.
Anything else the matter?

113
00:09:58,247 --> 00:10:01,478
- No. What should be?
- I don't know.

114
00:10:02,503 --> 00:10:04,778
Remember, anything I can do,
anytime, it's a pleasure.

115
00:10:05,049 --> 00:10:06,368
Ta.

116
00:10:06,592 --> 00:10:08,662
It won't be the same in the Old Globe now.

117
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:11,160
- Well, Babs is still there.
- Yeah, that's true.

118
00:10:11,434 --> 00:10:14,471
- And she's prettier than you.
- A matter of opinion.

119
00:10:14,771 --> 00:10:17,729
- Bye, now.
- Wait a minute. Give us your paper.

120
00:10:18,026 --> 00:10:20,096
Here you are.
This will make you a fortune.

121
00:10:20,361 --> 00:10:23,239
This afternoon in the 3:00, Coming Up.

122
00:10:23,534 --> 00:10:25,684
Never been out before,
but very well-fancied at home.

123
00:10:25,952 --> 00:10:29,024
This is a four-horse race, and the
other three have all won before.

124
00:10:29,334 --> 00:10:32,610
- So she'll start about twenty to one.
- Twenty to one?

125
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,239
Put your wad on it. She can't lose.

126
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,822
A little birdie told me,
and my little birdies are reliable.

127
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:38,414
Thanks again, Bob.

128
00:10:38,637 --> 00:10:41,913
<i>- Don't forget, Bob's your uncle.
- Good morning, Mr Rusk.</i>

129
00:10:43,062 --> 00:10:44,939
<i>Hello, Sergeant. What's new?</i>

130
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:48,421
Not much. But this necktie fellow's
giving them a bit of a headache.

131
00:10:48,737 --> 00:10:50,455
Can't seem to get a line on him.

132
00:10:50,698 --> 00:10:55,294
- Have you tried advertising?
- Funny! You're one for the birds.

133
00:10:55,662 --> 00:10:58,654
<i>Ask 'em all if they've ever had
a near miss with a bloke like that.</i>

134
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,427
- Or if any of their girlfriends have.
- Sure.

135
00:11:01,713 --> 00:11:04,227
Mind you, half of them haven't got
their heads screwed on right,

136
00:11:04,509 --> 00:11:06,739
let alone knowing when
they've been screwed off.

137
00:11:07,012 --> 00:11:08,684
Have you met my friend Dick B...

138
00:11:12,688 --> 00:11:14,679
Funny fella.

139
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:19,058
- Don't worry. I'll ask around.
- Thanks, Mr Rusk.

140
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,781
(Chattering)

141
00:11:30,881 --> 00:11:33,031
A large brandy.

142
00:11:33,674 --> 00:11:36,746
- What're you gonna have, Doctor?
- A pint and some cheese'll do me fine.

143
00:11:37,055 --> 00:11:39,285
Let me order us a hot lunch.
We've plenty of time.

144
00:11:39,558 --> 00:11:42,277
- Hello, Mr Usher.
- What's good today, Maisie?

145
00:11:42,564 --> 00:11:44,555
Stick to the shepherd's, I would.

146
00:11:44,816 --> 00:11:46,488
Right. That's two shepherd's pies, please.

147
00:11:46,736 --> 00:11:48,886
<i>And two pints.</i>

148
00:11:49,156 --> 00:11:52,671
I see our necktie murderer's
been up to it again.

149
00:11:52,995 --> 00:11:56,783
I saw the newspaper headlines
as we came away from the court.

150
00:11:57,124 --> 00:12:00,639
I wouldn't envy any medical man
giving evidence at that trial.

151
00:12:00,964 --> 00:12:04,957
- Why not?
- Surely it's easier in these days of...

152
00:12:05,303 --> 00:12:07,863
legally diminished responsibility.

153
00:12:08,141 --> 00:12:10,211
In many cases you may be right.

154
00:12:10,478 --> 00:12:12,150
But not here.

155
00:12:12,397 --> 00:12:16,595
The man who's killing these women
is a criminal, sexual psychopath.

156
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:19,061
And the legal profession has never
really known how to treat them.

157
00:12:19,824 --> 00:12:23,339
<i>(Doctor) I suppose
you could call them social misfits.</i>

158
00:12:24,081 --> 00:12:26,914
We were just talking about
the tie murderer, Maisie.

159
00:12:27,212 --> 00:12:31,603
<i>- You better watch out.
- He rapes 'em first, doesn't he?</i>

160
00:12:31,967 --> 00:12:33,480
Yes, I believe he does.

161
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:36,313
I suppose it's nice to know
every cloud has a silver lining.

162
00:12:36,599 --> 00:12:39,159
<i>- Oh!
- (Men Chuckle)</i>

163
00:12:39,436 --> 00:12:42,473
On the surface, in casual conversation

164
00:12:42,773 --> 00:12:46,766
they appear as ordinary, likable adult fellows.

165
00:12:47,114 --> 00:12:50,868
But emotionally they remain
as dangerous children,

166
00:12:51,202 --> 00:12:55,957
who may revert to primitive,
subhuman conduct at any moment.

167
00:12:56,334 --> 00:12:59,087
- Large brandy.
- You mean they'll kill at any time,

168
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,655
- just as the mood takes them?
- Exactly.

169
00:13:01,926 --> 00:13:04,121
And, being governed by the pleasure principle,

170
00:13:04,387 --> 00:13:07,504
<i>they're particularly dangerous when
their desires are being frustrated.</i>

171
00:13:09,353 --> 00:13:12,106
- Are you deaf?
- I distinctly said a large brandy.

172
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,719
There's scarcely enough in that
to cover the bottom.

173
00:13:13,943 --> 00:13:16,503
<i>Actually, make it a triple.</i>

174
00:13:16,781 --> 00:13:19,011
<i>I wonder if the police have got
any sort of line on this fellow.</i>

175
00:13:19,285 --> 00:13:21,241
Oh, I shouldn't think so.

176
00:13:21,497 --> 00:13:23,772
With psychopaths there's
usually no linking motive.

177
00:13:24,582 --> 00:13:26,095
Let's hope he slips up soon.

178
00:13:26,337 --> 00:13:29,454
<i>In one way, I rather hope he doesn't.</i>

179
00:13:29,758 --> 00:13:33,876
Well, we haven't had a good, juicy
series of sex murders since Christie.

180
00:13:34,222 --> 00:13:36,861
And they're so good for the tourist trade.

181
00:13:37,144 --> 00:13:40,102
Foreigners expect the squares
of London to be fog-wreathed,

182
00:13:40,398 --> 00:13:44,027
full of hansom cabs and littered
with ripped whores, don't you think?

183
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:51,137
<i>Hey, Dick!</i>

184
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:53,132
What about Coming Up then?

185
00:13:53,376 --> 00:13:55,765
No, I'm afraid I haven't any time.
Thanks all the same.

186
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:58,604
No, Coming Up, the horse.
It won by a mile.

187
00:13:58,882 --> 00:14:03,876
<i>Twenty to one! What did I tell you?</i>

188
00:14:04,265 --> 00:14:07,894
<i>- Made a fortune. Thanks a lot.
- Anytime.</i>

189
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:09,986
Hey, wait a minute!

190
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:14,635
This is my ma. Ma, meet Dick Blaney,

191
00:14:14,948 --> 00:14:16,859
the best pilot
who ever pulled a pint of beer.

192
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:20,652
- Hello, Mrs Rusk.
- Pleased to meet you, I'm sure.

193
00:14:20,955 --> 00:14:23,913
She lives down in Kent,
in the Garden of England!

194
00:14:25,586 --> 00:14:28,896
- Still got the grapes then?
- Oh, yeah. Keep 'em for later.

195
00:14:29,219 --> 00:14:31,858
You tell her to take the pips out.
They're bad for the appendix.

196
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:33,695
<i>- Ta-ta!
- Bye. Thanks again for the tip.</i>

197
00:14:34,475 --> 00:14:36,511
I told you, Bob's your uncle.

198
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,032
Twenty to one!

199
00:14:41,276 --> 00:14:45,474
Twenty to bloody one!
Christ! Dammit to hell!

200
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,191
<i>- (Door Opening)
- Well, my dears,</i>

201
00:15:17,453 --> 00:15:20,206
I'm sure I can say on behalf
of Mrs Blaney as well as myself,

202
00:15:20,498 --> 00:15:23,774
<i>that it's moments like this that make
all our efforts here worthwhile.</i>

203
00:15:24,088 --> 00:15:27,797
You mean, you just don't do it
for the money? (Laughing)

204
00:15:28,134 --> 00:15:31,763
<i>(Woman) Mrs Davisson, this is a business,
and financial considerations prevail.</i>

205
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:36,447
But our ultimate satisfaction is the
making happy of two lonely people.

206
00:15:36,774 --> 00:15:40,562
Nice of you, Miss Barling.
Keep up the good work!

207
00:15:40,904 --> 00:15:42,940
Well, it's up to us now, I guess, eh?

208
00:15:44,075 --> 00:15:45,713
Yes. And good-bye, Mr Salt.

209
00:15:45,952 --> 00:15:47,544
Bye, Miss Barling. Thank you.

210
00:15:48,205 --> 00:15:51,834
It's been our pleasure.
And I know you'll both be very happy.

211
00:15:52,169 --> 00:15:54,160
After all, I know you're
both mad about beekeeping.

212
00:15:54,424 --> 00:15:57,177
<i>- It's good to share an interest.
- I'm sure we will be.</i>

213
00:15:57,467 --> 00:15:59,981
Come on, Neville. Best foot forward.

214
00:16:00,263 --> 00:16:03,858
<i>(Neville) We should go straight and
get the marriage license, my dear.</i>

215
00:16:04,188 --> 00:16:06,144
What's your rush?

216
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,233
Let's go to my place first.

217
00:16:09,528 --> 00:16:11,837
Did you know, Neville,
that my late husband, Mr Davisson,

218
00:16:12,115 --> 00:16:15,107
was up at 5:30 every morning of his life?

219
00:16:15,411 --> 00:16:19,245
By the time he brought me my cup
of tea, which he did at 9:15,

220
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:22,780
he would've cleaned the whole
house; and he was so quiet about it,

221
00:16:23,089 --> 00:16:25,205
<i>that in 14 years, he never woke me once.</i>

222
00:16:25,466 --> 00:16:27,536
Not once!

223
00:16:27,804 --> 00:16:29,999
Oh, a neat man, was he, then?

224
00:16:30,267 --> 00:16:34,146
He liked a tidy place. So do I, come to that.

225
00:16:34,479 --> 00:16:36,834
Dandruff. We'll have
to get you something for that.

226
00:16:44,411 --> 00:16:47,608
Afternoon.

227
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:51,431
You're new here, aren't you?

228
00:16:51,753 --> 00:16:55,109
I've been here for over a year now.
What can I do for you?

229
00:16:55,428 --> 00:16:56,463
You can inform Mrs Blaney

230
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:59,989
that one of her less successful
exercises in matrimony is here.

231
00:17:00,309 --> 00:17:03,426
- And who shall I say is calling?
- Mr Blaney.

232
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:06,325
Or if you preferred it,
ex-Squadron Leader Blaney,

233
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:09,122
late of the RAF
and Mrs Blaney's matrimonial bed.

234
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:12,953
I see. Is Mrs Blaney expecting you?

235
00:17:13,285 --> 00:17:19,201
She must be. Everybody expects a
bad penny to turn up sooner or later.

236
00:17:20,003 --> 00:17:23,200
Mrs Blaney, there's a Mr Blaney to see you.

237
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:26,740
<i>Mr Blaney? Send him in, please, Monica.</i>

238
00:17:33,315 --> 00:17:37,069
- Hello, Brenda.
- Hello, Richard.

239
00:17:37,404 --> 00:17:39,235
What are you doing here?

240
00:17:39,489 --> 00:17:42,526
I just thought I'd call around.

241
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:44,898
<i>- Well, come in. Take a seat.
- Thanks.</i>

242
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:50,541
It's good to see you.

243
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:54,074
You too. You look fine.

244
00:17:54,386 --> 00:18:00,097
I'll be with you in a minute.
I've got to finish writing up a few notes.

245
00:18:00,937 --> 00:18:02,609
How is everything, Brenda?

246
00:18:02,857 --> 00:18:06,088
<i>- You making a fortune?
- Things are going very well.</i>

247
00:18:06,402 --> 00:18:09,599
Streets of London full of lonely
hearts beating a path to your door?

248
00:18:09,909 --> 00:18:11,786
That's it.

249
00:18:12,827 --> 00:18:16,706
I'm amazed that in an age where
we nearly all think marriage is hell

250
00:18:17,043 --> 00:18:20,638
<i>- that you can find any clients.
- If you've just come to insult me -</i>

251
00:18:20,965 --> 00:18:24,878
- I'm not insulting you!
- Please lower your voice.

252
00:18:25,222 --> 00:18:28,931
Why? I don't care if Vinegar Joe
out there does hear me.

253
00:18:29,267 --> 00:18:31,258
<i>Why don't you get her
married off, by the way?</i>

254
00:18:31,523 --> 00:18:34,242
<i>Preferably to a 700-pound Japanese wrestler.</i>

255
00:18:34,527 --> 00:18:37,041
<i>That should iron out some
of her creases a little.</i>

256
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:41,222
Monica, dear, it's nearly 4:30.

257
00:18:41,494 --> 00:18:42,643
Why don't you take
the rest of the afternoon off?

258
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:44,827
<i>I'm sure there's some shopping
you'd like to do.</i>

259
00:18:45,084 --> 00:18:48,315
Well, thank you, Mrs Blaney,
if you're sure you don't need me.

260
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:51,906
I'm quite sure, thank you. Good night.

261
00:18:56,683 --> 00:18:59,561
<i>(Brenda) Why do you always come
to see me when you're drunk?</i>

262
00:18:59,857 --> 00:19:02,451
<i>(Blaney) I don't always come
to see you when I'm drunk.</i>

263
00:19:02,733 --> 00:19:05,884
<i>I don't always come to see you.
I haven't seen you for over a year.</i>

264
00:19:06,198 --> 00:19:09,076
<i>You were half seas over then,
and violent.</i>

265
00:19:09,368 --> 00:19:11,962
<i>- I'm not going through that again.
- Me violent?</i>

266
00:19:12,248 --> 00:19:14,125
Don't be bloody ridiculous.

267
00:19:14,374 --> 00:19:16,171
Would I raise a hand
to the goddess of love?

268
00:19:16,419 --> 00:19:19,775
What Brenda Blaney brings together
let no man put asunder!

269
00:19:21,801 --> 00:19:24,361
<i>I didn't say you were violent to me.</i>

270
00:19:24,641 --> 00:19:29,317
But you certainly acted the fool
and threw the furniture about a bit.

271
00:19:37,115 --> 00:19:39,583
Just look at the state you're in!

272
00:19:39,868 --> 00:19:42,018
- Really!
- Oh, leave me alone.

273
00:19:42,289 --> 00:19:44,280
Bachelors are supposed
to be untidy, aren't they?

274
00:19:44,544 --> 00:19:48,742
Isn't tidiness most women's dowry,
or don't you preach that here?

275
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:51,285
Oh, we are bitter today.

276
00:19:52,595 --> 00:19:55,905
- What's the matter?
- I'm sorry.

277
00:19:56,227 --> 00:19:59,344
I had a bad day, that's all. I lost my job.

278
00:20:00,692 --> 00:20:02,444
How?

279
00:20:02,693 --> 00:20:05,890
I got fired, that's how.
What do you think, I mislaid it?

280
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,031
<i>For pinching a glass of brandy.</i>

281
00:20:09,411 --> 00:20:11,606
My employer thought I wasn't going
to put the money in the till.

282
00:20:11,874 --> 00:20:12,943
Till?

283
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:19,086
I was working,
until this morning, as a barman.

284
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:23,781
And I was given a very good horse
by a friend of mine, one Bob Rusk.

285
00:20:24,141 --> 00:20:28,578
It came in at twenty to one, and
I didn't have enough cash to back it.

286
00:20:28,939 --> 00:20:30,577
I'm sorry.

287
00:20:33,321 --> 00:20:35,277
Well, these things always go in threes.

288
00:20:35,532 --> 00:20:38,569
I wonder what the rest of the day
has in store.

289
00:20:38,872 --> 00:20:41,432
Dinner with me, I hope.

290
00:20:44,503 --> 00:20:46,858
That, of course, would be delightful, but -

291
00:20:47,133 --> 00:20:51,888
I mean, of course, on me. We'll go to my club.

292
00:20:52,265 --> 00:20:54,335
But I must finish these letters first.

293
00:20:54,603 --> 00:20:57,356
Here's the address, in case you've forgotten it.

294
00:20:57,648 --> 00:21:01,197
How will it be if we meet there
'round about 7:30?

295
00:21:01,529 --> 00:21:02,848
Fine.

296
00:21:04,239 --> 00:21:07,436
Thanks for a lovely evening.
It was great. I mean that.

297
00:21:07,746 --> 00:21:09,737
Thanks for joining me.

298
00:21:09,998 --> 00:21:12,671
It was a damn sight better
than the leftovers at The Globe,

299
00:21:12,959 --> 00:21:14,950
not that I'm in for more of those.

300
00:21:15,216 --> 00:21:16,695
You ought to get married again, Richard.

301
00:21:16,924 --> 00:21:21,315
Oh, no. You ought to know I'm no
good at it. How long did we have?

302
00:21:21,684 --> 00:21:24,835
<i>- Nine years, was it?
- Ten.</i>

303
00:21:25,143 --> 00:21:29,136
Ah, ten years. It was a good job
you got out when you did.

304
00:21:29,482 --> 00:21:33,998
I don't know. I suppose I was lucky
the agency worked out for me.

305
00:21:34,368 --> 00:21:37,326
You mean, you're lucky
you haven't had to rely on me.

306
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,497
- I didn't say that.
- But you meant it.

307
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:44,204
I suppose some people are good
at organisation and others aren't.

308
00:21:44,548 --> 00:21:47,381
<i>- That's all I meant.
- And I'm not, I suppose.</i>

309
00:21:47,678 --> 00:21:50,750
Rubbish! You know what filthy luck I had.

310
00:21:51,058 --> 00:21:52,650
Was it my fault that the roadhouse didn't go?

311
00:21:52,893 --> 00:21:55,407
<i>- It was OK before the motorway.
- I know.</i>

312
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,645
Was it my fault the council
tore down the riding stables?

313
00:21:57,899 --> 00:22:01,050
I know. I know life can be very unfair.

314
00:22:01,363 --> 00:22:03,081
But you never used to be sorry for yourself.

315
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:06,201
<i>Where's the Richard Blaney I married?</i>

316
00:22:06,495 --> 00:22:10,204
Richard Blaney, DFC.
Do you remember the citation?

317
00:22:10,543 --> 00:22:12,977
"For inspiring leadership, skill,

318
00:22:13,255 --> 00:22:15,246
<i>and tenacity of purpose. '</i>

319
00:22:15,507 --> 00:22:17,862
You divorced him.
That's what happened to him.

320
00:22:18,137 --> 00:22:20,446
Tell me, what sort of skill do
you need to deal with shopkeepers

321
00:22:20,725 --> 00:22:23,000
<i>- and interfering bureaucrats?
- Shh. Everyone's listening.</i>

322
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:28,719
Let them. I'll bet they've never had
to tear down their own livelihood.

323
00:22:29,112 --> 00:22:31,706
<i>It's alright for you. You just go
and build it up somewhere else.</i>

324
00:22:31,991 --> 00:22:34,346
You're like that. You're good at business.

325
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:36,610
I'll bet they're all good at business here.

326
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:38,349
I'll bet you're making a fortune
out of that agency.

327
00:22:38,584 --> 00:22:41,894
<i>And why not?
If you can't make love, sell it.</i>

328
00:22:42,214 --> 00:22:44,933
<i>The respectable kind, of course.
The married kind!</i>

329
00:22:46,803 --> 00:22:48,202
Now look what you've done.

330
00:22:48,431 --> 00:22:51,548
- Oh, sir. Let me help you.
- Leave me alone!

331
00:22:58,444 --> 00:23:02,073
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

332
00:23:03,285 --> 00:23:05,753
Come on. We'd better go.

333
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:08,030
Will you be alright?

334
00:23:08,291 --> 00:23:11,488
You did say you hadn't
enough money to put on that horse.

335
00:23:11,797 --> 00:23:15,472
Don't worry.
You've done enough for one day.

336
00:23:31,825 --> 00:23:34,623
- You had a coat too, didn't you?
- Yeah. That one there.

337
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:37,223
Mine's the pink one.

338
00:23:37,503 --> 00:23:40,301
No, no, no. That's not allowed.

339
00:23:40,588 --> 00:23:42,579
Rules of the club.

340
00:23:46,724 --> 00:23:48,715
Thank you.

341
00:24:01,284 --> 00:24:04,401
It's alright, Richard.
I've got it here. Thank you.

342
00:24:04,706 --> 00:24:07,504
So, this is it, huh?

343
00:24:07,793 --> 00:24:11,627
Can I come in?
I'd like to see where you live.

344
00:24:11,967 --> 00:24:14,959
Go along now. Run along home. It's late.

345
00:24:15,263 --> 00:24:19,017
- You call this late?
- It's late enough for a working girl.

346
00:24:19,352 --> 00:24:22,788
Come on, Brenda. I won't be long, I promise.

347
00:24:23,106 --> 00:24:26,940
Alright, but only for a few minutes, mind.

348
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,747
OK, thanks. I won't need you.

349
00:24:40,756 --> 00:24:42,747
<i>(Man Coughs)</i>

350
00:25:02,623 --> 00:25:05,217
It just fell out of your pocket
onto the floor.

351
00:25:05,499 --> 00:25:08,650
And I was just putting it back...
when you were asleep.

352
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:12,196
It sort of jerked out like on the floor.

353
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:15,308
I was putting 'em in quiet like
so as not to waken you.

354
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:18,352
Keep your hands out of my pockets,
or I'll break your arms!

355
00:25:18,645 --> 00:25:23,116
Honestly, there's nothing I detest
more than someone taking liberties

356
00:25:23,485 --> 00:25:26,477
<i>with a fine gentleman like yourself.</i>

357
00:25:34,502 --> 00:25:36,493
<i>(Door Opens)</i>

358
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,898
Oh, it's you again, Mr Robinson.

359
00:25:41,134 --> 00:25:43,807
Yes, I'm afraid so.

360
00:25:44,097 --> 00:25:46,327
I'm having my lunch just now.

361
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:50,593
If you want an appointment,
perhaps you'd see my secretary.

362
00:25:50,942 --> 00:25:54,651
<i>- By the way, how did you get in?
- No problem, really.</i>

363
00:25:54,989 --> 00:25:56,945
<i>Just a question of using your head.</i>

364
00:25:59,204 --> 00:26:03,436
I waited in the courtyard
'til I saw her go out to lunch.

365
00:26:03,794 --> 00:26:07,469
<i>- It all seems a bit elaborate.
- Yeah, perhaps, but -</i>

366
00:26:10,052 --> 00:26:12,202
You're the one I wanted to see.

367
00:26:14,056 --> 00:26:16,695
I thought I'd already explained
to you that we cannot help you.

368
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:22,737
Oh, come on now. I know that you
can be most helpful, when you try.

369
00:26:23,154 --> 00:26:27,272
Look, Mr Robinson,
you want women of a specific type.

370
00:26:27,618 --> 00:26:28,733
<i>How shall I put it?</i>

371
00:26:28,954 --> 00:26:31,309
Certain peculiarities appeal to you,

372
00:26:31,583 --> 00:26:35,019
<i>and you need women to submit to them.</i>

373
00:26:35,339 --> 00:26:37,933
Here we have, I'm afraid,
a very normal clientele.

374
00:26:38,216 --> 00:26:39,854
As I say, we can do nothing for you.

375
00:26:40,096 --> 00:26:42,087
<i>Now if you'll kindly let me
get on with my lunch.</i>

376
00:26:42,348 --> 00:26:46,387
I don't think you're really
trying your best for me.

377
00:26:46,731 --> 00:26:50,360
I mean, if you can fix up a lot
of idiots, then why not me? Hmm?

378
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:54,140
I've explained. You're different.

379
00:26:54,739 --> 00:26:56,616
How so?

380
00:26:56,868 --> 00:26:59,257
I have my good points.

381
00:26:59,541 --> 00:27:01,577
I like flowers,

382
00:27:01,833 --> 00:27:05,428
<i>and... fruit.</i>

383
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:07,748
People like me.

384
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,858
I've got things to give.

385
00:27:11,099 --> 00:27:12,817
I'm sorry.

386
00:27:13,811 --> 00:27:16,928
I thought matrimonial agencies were
supposed to bring people together?

387
00:27:17,732 --> 00:27:20,007
Not people like you.

388
00:27:20,278 --> 00:27:22,269
Somehow I don't think
our clients would appreciate

389
00:27:22,531 --> 00:27:24,408
your conception of a loving relationship.

390
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,491
I get on with all sorts of people.

391
00:27:26,744 --> 00:27:28,700
Good. Then you don't need us.

392
00:27:29,916 --> 00:27:33,272
- There are other marriage agencies.
- Then go elsewhere.

393
00:27:33,588 --> 00:27:35,818
<i>Not that any reputable agency
would service you.</i>

394
00:27:36,259 --> 00:27:38,932
I've been elsewhere.

395
00:27:39,221 --> 00:27:43,612
But... this one, for me, is the best...

396
00:27:43,976 --> 00:27:48,572
<i>because... I like you.</i>

397
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,112
You're... my type of woman.

398
00:27:59,291 --> 00:28:02,488
<i>- Don't be ridiculous.
- I'm serious.</i>

399
00:28:04,088 --> 00:28:06,079
I respect a woman like you,

400
00:28:06,342 --> 00:28:08,333
and I know how to treat you as well.

401
00:28:12,602 --> 00:28:16,800
You know, in my trade we have a saying.

402
00:28:17,151 --> 00:28:18,869
<i>We put it on the fruit.</i>

403
00:28:19,821 --> 00:28:22,540
"Don't squeeze the goods 'til they're yours."

404
00:28:23,409 --> 00:28:25,445
<i>Now, that's me.</i>

405
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:29,815
I would never do that.

406
00:28:30,126 --> 00:28:31,320
You know that, don't you?

407
00:28:36,636 --> 00:28:39,389
Excuse me. I've just remembered
a call I've got to make.

408
00:28:40,977 --> 00:28:42,933
There's no need to call the police.

409
00:28:47,861 --> 00:28:50,500
What made you think
I was going to call the police?

410
00:28:51,573 --> 00:28:53,564
Just intuition, I suppose.

411
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:56,903
Oh! English?

412
00:28:57,790 --> 00:28:59,781
Yeah, of course it is.

413
00:29:03,966 --> 00:29:06,958
That's a very frugal lunch
you've got there.

414
00:29:07,262 --> 00:29:09,253
Frugal...

415
00:29:09,516 --> 00:29:11,507
and mean.

416
00:29:11,768 --> 00:29:14,680
Certainly not enough to support
a lady with your opulent figure.

417
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:21,699
Rather too opulent, I'm afraid,
these days; hence the frugality.

418
00:29:22,036 --> 00:29:24,027
Why don't you come out and have
a slap-up lunch with me?

419
00:29:24,287 --> 00:29:26,676
I really can't leave the office just now.

420
00:29:26,958 --> 00:29:31,474
- I'd buy you the best lunch in town.
- No, I c-

421
00:29:33,093 --> 00:29:36,483
Alright. It's a deal.

422
00:29:37,597 --> 00:29:39,667
You mean it?
You'll come and have lunch with me?

423
00:29:39,936 --> 00:29:41,927
Of course.

424
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:45,460
Just let me wash my hands. Aah!

425
00:29:48,239 --> 00:29:51,675
- I thought we were going to lunch.
- Yes, of course we're going to lunch.

426
00:29:51,994 --> 00:29:53,985
Afterwards.

427
00:29:54,245 --> 00:29:56,236
- (Shouts)
- Aah!

428
00:29:57,502 --> 00:30:01,814
Alright. I know what you want, but not here.

429
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:04,769
- Let's go back to my place.
- But this is your place.

430
00:30:05,054 --> 00:30:06,851
You've got nothing to worry about here.

431
00:30:07,099 --> 00:30:10,296
- My secretary may come back soon.
- Really?

432
00:30:10,603 --> 00:30:12,958
How long do you give her
to eat her frugal lunch?

433
00:30:13,231 --> 00:30:16,109
Fifteen minutes. She may be here any minute.

434
00:30:16,404 --> 00:30:18,520
The outside door is locked.

435
00:30:18,782 --> 00:30:20,773
She's got her own key.

436
00:30:23,123 --> 00:30:25,114
I don't believe you.

437
00:30:26,333 --> 00:30:32,090
Do you know what happens
to wicked girls who tell wicked lies?

438
00:30:34,138 --> 00:30:36,129
(Groaning)

439
00:30:40,439 --> 00:30:43,397
Don't worry. Don't worry.

440
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:47,243
You've got nothing to worry about.

441
00:30:51,162 --> 00:30:52,481
Agh!

442
00:31:04,972 --> 00:31:06,769
Leave me alone. Please!

443
00:31:07,015 --> 00:31:09,404
T-Take the money out of my bag,

444
00:31:09,687 --> 00:31:11,803
but please, leave me alone.

445
00:31:15,947 --> 00:31:19,860
In my bag there's enough money to
buy any woman you want. It's yours.

446
00:31:20,202 --> 00:31:22,841
Take it! Just take it!

447
00:31:23,125 --> 00:31:28,040
I don't buy women.
It's you I want. You're my type.

448
00:31:28,424 --> 00:31:31,621
You are. Yes.

449
00:31:31,929 --> 00:31:33,726
You are my type of woman.

450
00:31:33,972 --> 00:31:36,167
<i>(Phone Ringing)</i>

451
00:31:36,435 --> 00:31:38,312
L-Let me answer the telephone.

452
00:31:38,561 --> 00:31:41,519
If you don't,
the caller will come here in person.

453
00:31:41,818 --> 00:31:45,447
I told you, I locked the outer door.
We won't be disturbed.

454
00:31:45,781 --> 00:31:48,341
(Sobbing) Oh, God!

455
00:31:48,619 --> 00:31:50,655
<i>- (Ringing Continues)
- Leave me alone.</i>

456
00:31:51,706 --> 00:31:54,584
Alright. Alright, I won't struggle.

457
00:31:54,877 --> 00:32:00,668
But I like you to struggle.
A lot of women like to struggle.

458
00:32:01,973 --> 00:32:05,727
Please, don't tear my dress.

459
00:32:06,061 --> 00:32:10,259
I'll take it off if you like.

460
00:32:10,607 --> 00:32:12,996
(Gasping, Groaning)

461
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:16,270
Lovely.

462
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:19,002

469
00:32:34,142 --> 00:32:35,131
<i>Lovely!</i>

470
00:32:35,352 --> 00:32:38,071
Nor for the destruction
that wasteth at noonday.

471
00:32:38,356 --> 00:32:39,755
<i>Lovely.</i>

472

He shall give His angels charge over thee,
to guard thee in all thy ways.

<i>Lovely!</i>

474

Lovely!

475

<i>(Shouting) Lovely!</i>

477
00:32:55,798 --> 00:32:57,117
Lovely.

478

You... bitch!

479
00:33:08,565 --> 00:33:12,114
Women! They're all the same.

480
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:18,019
They are.

481
00:33:18,288 --> 00:33:20,279
I'll show you.

482
00:33:34,144 --> 00:33:37,102
My God! The tie!

Hello, Globe?
May I speak to Barbara Milligan?

497
00:37:40,704 --> 00:37:44,140
Is that you, Blaney?
Listen, you've got a bloody nerve

498
00:37:44,459 --> 00:37:46,290
<i>ringin' up here in my busiest time.</i>

499
00:37:46,964 --> 00:37:49,398
I don't know where she is.
She's probably in the other bar.

500
00:37:49,676 --> 00:37:52,634
<i>I most certainly will not nip 'round
and fetch her. She's busy.</i>

501
00:37:52,928 --> 00:37:55,601
- Hello, Dickie. Is that you?
- Hurry up. It's not a singles club.

502
00:37:55,894 --> 00:37:58,044
- Here, guv. Give us a pint.
- Yeah?

503
00:37:58,312 --> 00:37:59,791
I'm fine. How are you?

504
00:38:00,024 --> 00:38:03,096
I'm OK. Look, I need my things,

505
00:38:03,404 --> 00:38:06,794
but I don't particularly fancy
meeting Forsythe.

506
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:11,350
Do you think you could put 'em in
my bag and meet me this afternoon?

507
00:38:11,707 --> 00:38:14,904
Are you sure?
I don't want to mess things up for you.

508
00:38:15,213 --> 00:38:17,852
Don't worry. It's my half day today.
Where shall I meet you?

509
00:38:18,675 --> 00:38:21,587
I'll be opposite the Leicester Square
Odeon, 4:00. OK?

510
00:38:21,888 --> 00:38:25,164
OK, at 4:00. I've gotta run now. Bye.

511
00:38:25,978 --> 00:38:27,536
Don't start lending him money.
You'll never get it back.

512
00:38:27,773 --> 00:38:29,047
Mind your own business.

513
00:38:29,274 --> 00:38:31,390
- He's no good for you, Babs.
- And you are?

514
00:38:31,652 --> 00:38:34,041
Hey, guv! Take a whiff of this!

515
00:38:38,912 --> 00:38:42,188
How far from here was the place
you had lunch, Miss Barling?

516
00:38:42,502 --> 00:38:44,254
About five or ten minutes.

517
00:38:46,091 --> 00:38:48,161
<i>(Police Sergeant) Good afternoon, sir.</i>

518
00:38:48,424 --> 00:38:52,417
Good afternoon, one and all.
This is Miss Barling, sir.

519
00:38:52,765 --> 00:38:55,154
- Would you do the honours?
- Certainly, sir.

520
00:38:55,435 --> 00:38:57,471
The murdered woman is a Mrs Brenda Blaney.

521
00:38:57,730 --> 00:39:02,167
She ran this business, and was found
by her secretary, Miss Barling,

522
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:06,523
on her return from lunch
at approximately 2:00, sir.

523
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:10,976
- Afternoon.
- Afternoon, sir.

524
00:39:13,211 --> 00:39:15,725
- Has Miss Barling any ideas?
- She certainly has.

525
00:39:16,006 --> 00:39:18,122
She says she saw
the murdered woman's ex-husband

526
00:39:18,386 --> 00:39:21,583
leaving the building
just as she came back, sir.

527
00:39:21,892 --> 00:39:23,962
I saw him clear as day.
It was Blaney, alright.

528
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:28,141
<i>He came out of the door downstairs
and walked down the alley.</i>

529
00:39:28,485 --> 00:39:30,715
The beast!

530
00:39:30,988 --> 00:39:32,979
I'm sorry, Miss Barling. I must press you.

531
00:39:33,241 --> 00:39:35,994
Are you sure it was Mr Blaney?

532
00:39:36,286 --> 00:39:38,356
Absolutely! I'd know him anywhere.

533
00:39:38,622 --> 00:39:41,295
He came here yesterday afternoon,
and was perfectly horrid.

534
00:39:41,586 --> 00:39:44,737
He'd been drinking
and insisted on seeing Mrs Blaney.

535
00:39:45,047 --> 00:39:49,325
- And did he see her?
- Yes. She'd never turn anyone away.

536
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:52,147
- What happened?
- Oh, I don't know.

537
00:39:52,434 --> 00:39:54,425
They started having a row
almost immediately.

538
00:39:54,687 --> 00:39:57,076
Mrs Blaney came out and said I might go.

539
00:39:57,358 --> 00:40:00,350
Quite naturally I didn't want
to embarrass her, so I left.

540
00:40:00,655 --> 00:40:05,524
I couldn't help overhearing that
Mr Blaney was becoming very violent,

541
00:40:05,912 --> 00:40:08,790
both in his language and his behaviour.

542
00:40:09,084 --> 00:40:13,043
- Did he strike Mrs Blaney?
- Yes, I think so.

543
00:40:13,382 --> 00:40:17,739
- There was the sound of a blow.
- I see.

544
00:40:18,096 --> 00:40:20,166
Miss Barling, could you
describe Mr Blaney for us?

545
00:40:20,431 --> 00:40:22,945
<i>What he looked like,
what he was wearing and so on.</i>

546
00:40:23,229 --> 00:40:25,060
Yes, I think I can.

547
00:40:25,316 --> 00:40:28,467
He was a man in his thirties,
about an inch or so under six foot tall.

548
00:40:28,777 --> 00:40:31,132
He had dark hair, green eyes and a moustache.

549
00:40:31,408 --> 00:40:33,842
I estimate his weight at about 155 pounds.

550
00:40:34,119 --> 00:40:36,155
<i>He was wearing a rather old-fashioned jacket</i>

551
00:40:36,415 --> 00:40:39,009
with leather patches
on the shoulders and elbows.

552
00:40:39,291 --> 00:40:41,361
In my opinion, it was
quite unsuitable for London.

553
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:43,461
He was also carrying a raincoat.

554
00:40:44,634 --> 00:40:46,750
That's an extraordinarily
precise description, Miss Barling.

555
00:40:47,387 --> 00:40:52,222
In my job I've learned to keep
a sharp eye on men, Inspector.

556
00:40:53,562 --> 00:40:54,551
Excuse me.

557
00:40:54,774 --> 00:40:56,969
I found this handbag on the desk,
and there's no sign of any money.

558
00:40:57,234 --> 00:40:58,633
That doesn't make sense.

559
00:40:58,863 --> 00:41:01,900
I cashed a cheque for 50 pounds
for her yesterday lunchtime.

560
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,634
It makes perfect sense to me.
Where does she put her money in this bag?

561
00:41:04,913 --> 00:41:08,826
- Sometimes she zips it in the pocket.
- Mmm.

562
00:41:09,168 --> 00:41:11,159
Have this face powder identified,
will you, Sergeant?

563
00:41:11,423 --> 00:41:14,062
There might be some on the stolen money.
We might be lucky.

564
00:41:14,342 --> 00:41:16,060
Alright, sir.

565
00:41:16,304 --> 00:41:18,101
What about fingerprints?

566
00:41:18,349 --> 00:41:20,021
With all the clowns who come
in here, there'll be dozens.

567
00:41:35,997 --> 00:41:37,396
<i>Coburg Hotel, Bayswater.</i>

568
00:41:37,626 --> 00:41:40,584
Hey, wait a moment.
How can you afford a hotel?

569
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,678
- I'll tell you later.
- OK.

570
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:47,360
- So, what you been up to, Dick?
- (Sighs) Well, last night

571
00:41:47,681 --> 00:41:51,469
I allowed myself to be pampered
at a Salvation Army hostel.

572
00:41:51,813 --> 00:41:53,804
I tell you, after mixing
with some of the types in there,

573
00:41:54,064 --> 00:41:55,577
one's clothing needs fumigation.

574
00:41:55,818 --> 00:41:58,127
- Smell that.
- Whew!

575
00:41:58,406 --> 00:42:00,874
- You mean you slept there?
- Yeah... spasmodically.

576
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,833
- What? With all the old men?
- Yes, that's it.

577
00:42:04,124 --> 00:42:07,161
We had a high old time.
The conversation was mature,

578
00:42:07,459 --> 00:42:09,017
the Red Biddy flowed down
the odd throats,

579
00:42:09,256 --> 00:42:11,247
and the good fellowship
of the open road prevailed.

580
00:42:11,508 --> 00:42:14,227
- Red Biddy. What's that?
- Blended red wine.

581
00:42:14,512 --> 00:42:16,662
Half vino, half metholated spirits.

582
00:42:16,932 --> 00:42:20,288
- But why, Dick?
- Reasonable terms for bachelors.

583
00:42:20,606 --> 00:42:23,200
- Thirty pence a night, in fact.
- I don't understand.

584
00:42:23,482 --> 00:42:26,315
How can you afford the Coburg?

585
00:42:26,613 --> 00:42:28,968
Well, I managed to get some money.

586
00:42:29,241 --> 00:42:30,754
- Since last night?
- Yeah.

587
00:42:30,994 --> 00:42:35,351
- I, uh, I collected an old debt.
- That was lucky.

588
00:42:35,708 --> 00:42:37,027
Yeah.

589
00:42:38,671 --> 00:42:39,990
OK.

590
00:42:41,132 --> 00:42:42,804
Oooh!

591
00:43:05,169 --> 00:43:07,160
Thank you.

592
00:43:20,856 --> 00:43:23,609
- Double room, please.
- What are you up to? Not here!

593
00:43:23,903 --> 00:43:25,780
- Ssh.
- Would that be with two singles,

594
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:28,669
or the, uh, matrimonial-size bed?

595
00:43:28,951 --> 00:43:30,828
The mat... Double bed.

596
00:43:31,078 --> 00:43:35,594
- Please.
- Yes. I see.

597
00:43:35,961 --> 00:43:39,078
Three-two-two should suit you.
The Cupid Room.

598
00:43:39,383 --> 00:43:42,659
<i>- Really?
- Yes. It's very cozy.</i>

599
00:43:42,972 --> 00:43:47,568
<i>- If you'll just sign the register.
- Yes, of course.</i>

600
00:43:47,937 --> 00:43:51,009
(Sighs) Mr and Mrs Oscar Wilde.

601
00:43:51,316 --> 00:43:53,591
- Now, look here, Dick Blaney!
- Oscar, if you don't mind.

602
00:43:53,862 --> 00:43:57,411
<i>- Will you stop playing games!
- (Clerk) Excuse me.</i>

603
00:43:57,743 --> 00:44:01,622
That'll be ten pounds,
plus service charge of two pounds.

604
00:44:03,251 --> 00:44:05,481
Perhaps you'd care to settle now?

605
00:44:09,884 --> 00:44:11,397
- There we are.
- Thank you.

606
00:44:11,637 --> 00:44:14,435
- Room, please?
- Three-two-two, Bertie.

607
00:44:20,149 --> 00:44:22,140
Follow me, please.

608
00:44:29,621 --> 00:44:31,612
You've got 322. That's nice.

609
00:44:31,874 --> 00:44:34,104
Yes. The Cupid Room, I think she called it.

610
00:44:34,379 --> 00:44:37,416
<i>Love's little arrows have struck quite
a few hearts in there, I can tell you.</i>

611
00:44:37,718 --> 00:44:39,709
Oh, yeah.

612
00:44:39,970 --> 00:44:41,961
Can I get you anything
from the pharmacy, sir?

613
00:44:42,223 --> 00:44:44,020
No, thank you.

614
00:44:53,865 --> 00:44:55,856
- Ta.
- Thank you, sir.

615
00:44:59,832 --> 00:45:01,823
<i>- (Blaney) Hey!
- Sir?</i>

616
00:45:02,086 --> 00:45:04,805
Hang on. Can you send this
to the cleaners for me?

617
00:45:05,090 --> 00:45:08,799
- Certainly, sir.
- And this. Tell them that it's urgent.

618
00:45:09,137 --> 00:45:12,652
And, uh, might as well take
the other half as well.

619
00:45:12,974 --> 00:45:14,965
Tell them that I want them sprayed.

620
00:45:15,229 --> 00:45:17,220
Sprayed, sir? With what?

621
00:45:17,481 --> 00:45:19,790
- DDT, my good man. What else?
- Sir?

622
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:24,427
Death to the lurking roach, porter.
Confusion to the insidious louse.

623
00:45:24,783 --> 00:45:28,332
- Get 'em cleaned and pressed, eh?
- Yes, sir.

624
00:46:22,533 --> 00:46:24,524
Oh, dear!

625
00:46:26,872 --> 00:46:29,306
Hey, Glad, take a look at this.

626
00:46:34,802 --> 00:46:37,680
Oh! Oh, that poor woman.

627
00:46:37,969 --> 00:46:41,359
It's the jacket I'm talkin' about.
The jacket! See what it says?

628
00:46:41,686 --> 00:46:45,281
"The police want to interview a man
seen leaving the matrimonial agency

629
00:46:45,608 --> 00:46:46,802
about the time of the murder."

630
00:46:47,026 --> 00:46:50,257
<i>"When last seen he was wearing
a tweed jacket with leather patches</i>

631
00:46:50,573 --> 00:46:54,043
<i>on the shoulders and elbows
and carrying a raincoat. '</i>

632
00:46:54,370 --> 00:46:58,204
- What an odd way to patch a jacket.
- It's meant to be like that!

633
00:46:58,541 --> 00:47:01,374
The party in 322 was wearin' it.

634
00:47:01,672 --> 00:47:04,709
Do you mean... Do you mean Mr Oscar Wilde?

635
00:47:05,009 --> 00:47:08,638
That's not his real name, silly.
Oscar Wilde, indeed!

636
00:47:08,975 --> 00:47:11,125
He's the fellow the police are looking for.

637
00:47:11,395 --> 00:47:13,113
Don't you see? He's the necktie murderer.

638
00:47:13,355 --> 00:47:16,188
And we've got him upstairs
at this very minute!

639
00:47:16,486 --> 00:47:20,240
Oh, dear! I only hope that girl isn't
wearing a necktie right now.

640
00:47:20,574 --> 00:47:24,044
I can't believe it! Not in the Cupid Room!

641
00:47:24,372 --> 00:47:26,966
You know, Glad, sometimes just
thinkin' about the lusts of men

642
00:47:27,251 --> 00:47:28,969
makes me want to heave.

643
00:47:29,212 --> 00:47:34,764
Hello. Will you give me the police, please?

644
00:47:35,179 --> 00:47:39,730
Hello, police? I'm the porter
of the Coburg Hotel, Bayswater.

645
00:47:40,101 --> 00:47:43,059
Could you come at once?
I've got this fellow you're looking for here.

646
00:47:43,356 --> 00:47:45,233
You know, the necktie murderer?

647
00:47:45,484 --> 00:47:50,877
He came here with a girl.

648
00:47:51,283 --> 00:47:53,843
Come away, Glad.
You're not to do anything suspicious.

649
00:48:18,324 --> 00:48:20,315
(Tyres Screeching)

650
00:48:48,991 --> 00:48:50,982
- (Knocking)
- Open up!

651
00:48:52,498 --> 00:48:54,489
- (Knocking)
- Open up! Police!

652
00:49:09,938 --> 00:49:12,247
They must've gone down the back stairs.

653
00:49:16,489 --> 00:49:18,719
But I ask you, in all conscience,

654
00:49:18,992 --> 00:49:22,302
is it likely I would murder a woman
I'd been married to for ten years?

655
00:49:22,622 --> 00:49:24,021
If it was true, it would be horrible.

656
00:49:24,251 --> 00:49:27,527
And rape her... after ten years of marriage?
Violently rape her?

657
00:49:27,838 --> 00:49:30,910
I don't know. Perhaps you was jealous of her.

658
00:49:31,219 --> 00:49:33,972
- Of Brenda? Oh, come off it.
- I didn't know Brenda. It's possible.

659
00:49:34,265 --> 00:49:35,857
Maybe you wanted to get rid of her.

660
00:49:36,101 --> 00:49:37,454
But I had got rid of her.

661
00:49:37,687 --> 00:49:40,406
We were divorced, remember.
We had been for two years.

662
00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:44,000
There was no question of alimony.
She earned far more than me.

663
00:49:44,322 --> 00:49:47,678
You got that money from her, didn't you?
You never collected a debt.

664
00:49:47,992 --> 00:49:49,710
Well, yes, I did.

665
00:49:49,953 --> 00:49:52,148
But she gave it to me the night
before when we had dinner.

666
00:49:52,416 --> 00:49:55,214
- Twenty pounds.
- Why lie about it, then?

667
00:49:56,796 --> 00:49:58,787
I suppose I was ashamed
to admit it, that's all.

668
00:49:59,050 --> 00:50:01,439
That makes sense, I suppose.

669
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:05,315
But if Brenda gave you that money,
why'd you sleep in the doss house?

670
00:50:05,642 --> 00:50:09,032
You could've afforded a hotel.
I didn't realise that I had it.

671
00:50:09,357 --> 00:50:11,154
She slipped it into the pocket of my raincoat.

672
00:50:11,402 --> 00:50:14,599
Oh, go on, Dick. Why don't you pull
the other one? It's got bells on it.

673
00:50:14,906 --> 00:50:17,943
But it's true! I suppose
she didn't want to embarrass me.

674
00:50:19,162 --> 00:50:21,198
You've got to admit, it is pretty tall.

675
00:50:21,457 --> 00:50:25,416
Not as tall as me sleeping in a doss
house with 20 quid in my pocket!

676
00:50:25,755 --> 00:50:28,110
If I knew I had it,
I'd never have gone there, would I?

677
00:50:28,385 --> 00:50:30,945
- Maybe.
- Maybe! You smelled that jacket!

678
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:32,619
Would you sleep there if you didn't have to?

679
00:50:32,849 --> 00:50:34,965
It wasn't that bad, that jacket.

680
00:50:35,227 --> 00:50:37,616
I still think it's a bit suspicious,
your sending it to the cleaners.

681
00:50:37,897 --> 00:50:38,932
Suspicious of what?

682
00:50:39,149 --> 00:50:41,424
In them sex cases,
they always do a lab test on the clothes.

683
00:50:41,694 --> 00:50:43,685
It stank to high heaven!

684
00:50:43,947 --> 00:50:46,780
That's why. You know it did.

685
00:50:49,164 --> 00:50:52,201
Barbara, I swear I'm telling the truth.

686
00:50:52,502 --> 00:50:55,539
Do I look like a sex murderer to you?

687
00:50:55,839 --> 00:51:00,549
Can you imagine me creeping around,
strangling women with ties?

688
00:51:00,929 --> 00:51:05,525
That's ridiculous. For a start, I only own two.

689
00:51:05,895 --> 00:51:09,046
Well, it's true. That jacket was a bit smelly.

690
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:11,269
And if you had known about the money,

691
00:51:11,528 --> 00:51:14,201
you wouldn't have stayed
with old men like that.

692
00:51:14,491 --> 00:51:16,766
Then you believe me?

693
00:51:17,038 --> 00:51:19,029
Thousands wouldn't.

694
00:51:19,291 --> 00:51:20,849
Thanks.

695
00:51:23,129 --> 00:51:25,563
I must be soft in the head
lettin' a suspected strangler

696
00:51:25,841 --> 00:51:27,832
put his arms around me.

697
00:51:28,096 --> 00:51:30,769
- Shows you trust me.
- I suppose so.

698
00:51:35,396 --> 00:51:38,672
Hey, what we gonna do?
The police will be looking for you!

699
00:51:38,985 --> 00:51:40,577
I don't know. I haven't thought yet.

700
00:51:40,821 --> 00:51:43,619
There's only one thing you can do.
Tell them what happened, like you told me.

701
00:51:43,908 --> 00:51:45,899
- No, I can't do that.
- You've got to!

702
00:51:46,162 --> 00:51:48,676
- They'd never believe me.
- Why not? I did.

703
00:51:48,956 --> 00:51:52,028
You're not the law.
I'm probably their only suspect.

704
00:51:52,337 --> 00:51:55,647
You have to go along and persuade
them to search for someone else.

705
00:51:55,966 --> 00:51:58,878
I mean, one look at you and they'd
know you wasn't a sadistic killer.

706
00:52:01,767 --> 00:52:03,758
<i>- (Man) Blaney!
- Come on!</i>

707
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:07,130
Dicko!

708
00:52:50,002 --> 00:52:53,597
Haven't done any of this
cloak-and-dagger stuff since the Suez business.

709
00:52:53,926 --> 00:52:56,565
That's when I first met Dicko,
in the squadron, you know.

710
00:52:56,844 --> 00:53:00,439
He was a bit of
a split-assed type then too.

711
00:53:06,275 --> 00:53:08,266
# (Whistling)

712
00:53:14,122 --> 00:53:16,078
<i>Hetty, you remember Dicko, don't you?</i>

713
00:53:16,333 --> 00:53:18,005
Of course. Come in.

714
00:53:18,251 --> 00:53:20,321
<i>- This is Miss Milligan.
- Hello, Miss Milligan.</i>

715
00:53:20,588 --> 00:53:23,307
- Pleased to meet you.
- I bumped into them in the park.

716
00:53:23,594 --> 00:53:26,825
How fortunate!
We haven't seen you in ages, Dick.

717
00:53:27,139 --> 00:53:29,972
How's Brenda? Do you still hear from her?

718
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,948
Well, uh, she's dead... I'm afraid.

719
00:53:35,233 --> 00:53:41,183
- Yes... and you killed her!
- Steady on, Hetty. He didn't do it.

720
00:53:41,619 --> 00:53:43,974
<i>- He's just been telling me all about it.
- Has he, now?</i>

721
00:53:47,166 --> 00:53:50,283
See, he was seen near the place
where Brenda was murdered.

722
00:53:50,590 --> 00:53:53,980
So the police think he's the strangler chap.
But he's not, of course.

723
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:57,056
<i>All he wants is a place to hide out.</i>

724
00:53:57,349 --> 00:54:00,341
And you suggested he should stay here.

725
00:54:01,605 --> 00:54:03,163
Well, yes. It seemed a good idea.

726
00:54:03,399 --> 00:54:05,276
<i>Nobody ever knows who's staying here.</i>

727
00:54:05,527 --> 00:54:08,803
You're a bloody fool, Johnny,
getting yourself involved like this.

728
00:54:09,117 --> 00:54:11,995
<i>- But he didn't do it.
- (Hetty) Of course he did it!</i>

729
00:54:12,286 --> 00:54:17,314
- What, old Dicko?
- Yes, Dicko, the chivalrous knight!

730
00:54:17,712 --> 00:54:20,021
<i>(Hetty) He always treated her like a chit!</i>

731
00:54:20,299 --> 00:54:22,335
I think you're absolutely wrong.

732
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:25,824
Don't you remember that
disgusting divorce petition?

733
00:54:26,139 --> 00:54:28,130
<i>The things you did to her!</i>

734
00:54:28,395 --> 00:54:31,273
- Divorce petition?
- Oh, didn't he tell you?

735
00:54:31,562 --> 00:54:35,794
He was divorced from his wife
on the grounds of extreme cruelty.

736
00:54:36,154 --> 00:54:37,906
Thank you very much.

737
00:54:39,575 --> 00:54:42,043
Well, is it true?

738
00:54:42,329 --> 00:54:43,318
Yes!

739
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:47,135
Both extreme mental and physical cruelty.

740
00:54:47,462 --> 00:54:49,453
Depravity was mentioned, I think.

741
00:54:49,716 --> 00:54:52,549
It had to read that way,
but there wasn't a word of truth in it!

742
00:54:52,845 --> 00:54:54,995
The lawyers made it all up.

743
00:54:55,264 --> 00:54:58,973
We didn't want to wait three years
for a divorce based on desertion,

744
00:54:59,312 --> 00:55:01,382
so I allowed her to divorce me
on the grounds of cruelty.

745
00:55:01,649 --> 00:55:04,083
Extreme cruelty.

746
00:55:04,362 --> 00:55:07,832
I wonder if the police have read a copy of it.

747
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:12,174
My God!

748
00:55:12,455 --> 00:55:14,411
<i>(Hetty) Yes, I'm sure they'll be fascinated.</i>

749
00:55:14,667 --> 00:55:18,455
- He's innocent, I know he is.
- You know it? How do you know it?

750
00:55:18,798 --> 00:55:21,790
As you say, they'd been divorced.
He had no call to do her in.

751
00:55:22,095 --> 00:55:25,724
There's no spiteful act
I'd put past old Dicko here,

752
00:55:26,059 --> 00:55:27,777
<i>especially if he were drunk.</i>

753
00:55:28,019 --> 00:55:30,135
Were you drunk when you did it?
Was that it?

754
00:55:30,398 --> 00:55:32,070
I didn't do it, Hetty.

755
00:55:32,317 --> 00:55:34,194
I didn't do it! I swear!

756
00:55:34,447 --> 00:55:38,042
Then why don't you go to the police
instead of involving Johnny?

757
00:55:38,368 --> 00:55:40,598
I didn't want to involve him. He insisted.

758
00:55:40,872 --> 00:55:43,306
That's right, I did.
Can't abandon a chap in trouble.

759
00:55:43,583 --> 00:55:47,053
I still say, why don't you go
to the police and inform them?

760
00:55:47,381 --> 00:55:48,814
They'd never believe him, that's why.

761
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:53,328
He's the only suspect they've got,
and with the evidence against him,

762
00:55:53,681 --> 00:55:56,718
they'd lock him up without
so much as a by-your-leave.

763
00:55:57,019 --> 00:56:00,250
Please hide him, Mrs Porter, just for tonight,

764
00:56:00,567 --> 00:56:02,558
until we can think what's best to do.

765
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:06,529
'Course we'll hide him.
Can't throw an old comrade to the cops.

766
00:56:06,868 --> 00:56:09,826
Well, if you want to be arrested
for harboring a wanted man,

767
00:56:10,122 --> 00:56:12,920
or subverting the course of justice
or whatever,

768
00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:14,928
on your own head be it, Johnny.

769
00:56:15,171 --> 00:56:17,526
But I wash my hands of the matter.

770
00:56:17,799 --> 00:56:20,677
Thank God we're off to Paris tomorrow.
That's all I can say.

771
00:56:20,970 --> 00:56:24,724
That is, if we're not all in jail!
I'm going shopping.

772
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:34,129
- Perhaps I'd better go.
- Nonsense, old chap.

773
00:56:34,406 --> 00:56:37,876
Don't worry about Hetty.
I'll calm her down. Use the sofa tonight.

774
00:56:38,204 --> 00:56:40,035
I must be off. I'm ever so late already.

775
00:56:40,290 --> 00:56:42,326
- What do you do, Miss Milligan?
- I work in a pub.

776
00:56:42,584 --> 00:56:45,018
- Same place he used to be.
- Really?

777
00:56:45,296 --> 00:56:49,050
Why don't both of you slip out of the
country 'til this thing's blown over?

778
00:56:49,386 --> 00:56:51,616
- Give me a hand at the Bulldog.
- Bulldog?

779
00:56:51,890 --> 00:56:55,849
It's an English pub I've opened in Paris.
They're the new thing there.

780
00:56:56,187 --> 00:56:58,496
That's a great idea. Why don't we?

781
00:56:58,775 --> 00:57:00,845
Not likely. I never was any good at French.

782
00:57:01,111 --> 00:57:03,102
You don't have to be. It's an English pub.

783
00:57:03,363 --> 00:57:06,958
As long as you can say "non,"
you'll be alright.

784
00:57:07,286 --> 00:57:09,277
- Well...
- Come on, Babs.

785
00:57:09,539 --> 00:57:11,530
You don't like the Globe
any more than I did.

786
00:57:11,794 --> 00:57:15,423
Meet me at the flower stall at
Victoria Station tomorrow at 11am.

787
00:57:15,757 --> 00:57:20,114
We can get a day trip to France.
You don't need a passport.

788
00:57:20,471 --> 00:57:23,224
- OK.
- Splendid!

789
00:57:23,518 --> 00:57:27,272
Froggies will roll over and die at
the sight of a real English barmaid.

790
00:57:27,607 --> 00:57:30,679
I must go now, really. You know Forsythe.

791
00:57:33,366 --> 00:57:36,358
Mum's the word, eh?
Don't tell a soul I'm here.

792
00:57:36,661 --> 00:57:38,652
Cross me heart and hope to die.

793
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:43,066
Thanks for lookin' after him.
Not at all, my dear.

794
00:57:43,338 --> 00:57:45,329
I'll come see you to the lift.

795
00:58:35,787 --> 00:58:38,585
Enjoying that, are you, sir?

796
00:58:38,877 --> 00:58:42,108
Sergeant, my wife is
currently taking a course

797
00:58:42,423 --> 00:58:44,698
at the Continental School
of Gourmet Cooking.

798
00:58:44,968 --> 00:58:47,528
Apparently they don't know the principle:
To eat well in this country,

799
00:58:47,805 --> 00:58:50,080
one must have breakfast
three times a day.

800
00:58:50,351 --> 00:58:53,343
<i>And an English breakfast at that.
I don't mean your caf complet.</i>

801
00:58:53,647 --> 00:58:56,605
- Beg pardon, sir?
- A cup of coffee half an inch deep,

802
00:58:56,902 --> 00:59:00,099
in floating bits of boiled milk,
and a sweet bun full of air.

803
00:59:00,407 --> 00:59:02,602
- That's what I had this morning.
- I see what you mean, sir.

804
00:59:02,867 --> 00:59:05,665
- I'm a... Quaker Oats man, myself.
- (Chuckles)

805
00:59:05,957 --> 00:59:07,356
<i>(Knock At Door)</i>

806
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:10,220
Excuse me, sir.

807
00:59:10,464 --> 00:59:13,422
This has just come in.
It's the lab report on the ten-pound note

808
00:59:13,717 --> 00:59:16,436
- that Blaney paid the hotel bill with.
- Yes.

809
00:59:16,722 --> 00:59:19,680
As you'll see, the note
bore traces of face powder

810
00:59:19,975 --> 00:59:22,330
identical to that which we found
in Mrs Blaney's handbag.

811
00:59:22,604 --> 00:59:25,277
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

812
00:59:25,568 --> 00:59:27,843
Well, Sergeant, we were in luck after all.

813
00:59:28,114 --> 00:59:31,993
- That just about does it for him.
- Looks very much like it.

814
00:59:32,327 --> 00:59:37,242
I've never run into any of these
jokers before. What are they like?

815
00:59:37,625 --> 00:59:40,014
Oh, they vary, but not a lot.

816
00:59:40,296 --> 00:59:43,129
The thing to remember is they hate
women, and are mostly impotent.

817
00:59:43,425 --> 00:59:48,738
- Impotent?
- Don't mistake rape for potency.

818
00:59:49,143 --> 00:59:50,462
In the latter stage of the disease,

819
00:59:50,686 --> 00:59:53,962
it's the strangling, not the sex,
that brings them on.

820
00:59:54,275 --> 00:59:56,391
Above all, of course, they're sadists.

821
00:59:56,653 --> 00:59:59,008
- You know what they are, I'm sure.
- Oh, yes, sir.

822
00:59:59,281 --> 01:00:03,115
If you don't, read all about it in here:
Mrs Blaney's divorce petition.

823
01:00:03,456 --> 01:00:05,890
It tells you a great deal
about the habits of our hero.

824
01:00:06,168 --> 01:00:08,159
<i>(Phone Ringing)</i>

825
01:00:08,421 --> 01:00:10,252
Yeah?

826
01:00:10,506 --> 01:00:14,055
Right. Put him on.
Yes, Chief Inspector Oxford speaking.

827
01:00:14,386 --> 01:00:17,776
My name is Forsythe, Inspector. Felix Forsythe.

828
01:00:18,102 --> 01:00:20,377
I run the Globe Public House, Covent Garden.

829
01:00:20,644 --> 01:00:23,920
I see from the newspaper you're
in charge of these strangling cases.

830
01:00:24,236 --> 01:00:25,589
Yes, that is so.

831
01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:28,414
Good, because I've got
some information to impart.

832
01:00:28,701 --> 01:00:33,297
Now, this man you're looking for,
the one with the patches on his suit.

833
01:00:33,666 --> 01:00:36,499
I know him. He worked here as a barman.

834
01:00:36,794 --> 01:00:40,150
His name is Richard Blaney.
He's a right bastard.

835
01:00:40,467 --> 01:00:45,018
Are you quite certain it's the same man?

836
01:00:45,391 --> 01:00:48,064
Gone off with your barmaid?
What exactly do you mean by "gone off"?

837
01:00:48,353 --> 01:00:50,503
She's been out all night with him
and hasn't yet returned.

838
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:55,050
I felt it my duty to tell you that
I consider her to be in great danger.

839
01:00:55,405 --> 01:00:56,884
That is, of course,
if she's still alive and kicking.

840
01:00:57,114 --> 01:00:59,105
Thank you for your information, Mr Forsythe.

841
01:00:59,368 --> 01:01:02,758
Tell me, what does this
barmaid of yours look like?

842
01:01:08,297 --> 01:01:12,415
I can set your mind at rest.
She was alive at 8:00 this morning.

843
01:01:12,762 --> 01:01:14,753
8:00 this morning?

844
01:01:15,015 --> 01:01:17,609
Well, where is she now? We opened at 11:00!

845
01:01:17,895 --> 01:01:21,934
But is she coming back here or not?
She's left all her clothes!

846
01:01:22,276 --> 01:01:23,994
I expect she'll turn up.

847
01:01:24,235 --> 01:01:27,352
Today, ladies abandon their honour
more readily than their clothes.

848
01:01:27,657 --> 01:01:31,172
Thank you for your information,
Mr Forsythe. I'll send someone over.

849
01:01:31,497 --> 01:01:35,126
That was Forsythe, manager of
the Globe Pub, Covent Garden.

850
01:01:41,387 --> 01:01:44,026
I tell you what, Jim,
I'm glad I'm not in the potato business.

851
01:01:44,306 --> 01:01:47,696
- Got enough troubles of me own.
- You're not a bad judge, Bob.

852
01:01:48,021 --> 01:01:50,410
The potato business is poison, always was.

853
01:01:50,693 --> 01:01:53,765
It costs a fortune to dig 'em up,
another fortune to transport them.

854
01:01:54,070 --> 01:01:57,346
<i>And what do you have at the end?
Hardly any money for them.</i>

855
01:01:57,662 --> 01:01:59,254
Mostly you can't sell them.

856
01:01:59,495 --> 01:02:02,214
I've got to send a truckload
back up to Lincolnshire tonight.

857
01:02:02,499 --> 01:02:05,935
And what will they do with them?
They'll plow them back in.

858
01:02:06,255 --> 01:02:07,847
<i>(Jim) Can you beat it?</i>

859
01:02:08,091 --> 01:02:09,683
<i>And they say
there's people hungry in this world.</i>

860
01:02:09,928 --> 01:02:12,396
<i>True, Jim.
And there are a few thirsty as well.</i>

861
01:02:12,682 --> 01:02:15,071
<i>Come on, have one with your Uncle Bob.</i>

862
01:02:17,354 --> 01:02:19,151
<i>Good afternoon!</i>

863
01:02:19,399 --> 01:02:23,438
Where do you think you've been?
Your half-day was yesterday!

864
01:02:23,779 --> 01:02:27,215
You took a hell of a chance,
spending the night with a murderer.

865
01:02:27,536 --> 01:02:29,492
- How do you know what I did?
- Now come off it.

866
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:31,702
You took his clothes.
You didn't come home. It stands to reason.

867
01:02:31,958 --> 01:02:35,189
- Mind your own bleeding business!
- Don't talk to me like that!

868
01:02:35,506 --> 01:02:39,260
I was worried you might be next.
I even phoned the police.

869
01:02:39,594 --> 01:02:40,583
- Police?
- Yeah. They wanna talk to you.

870
01:02:40,805 --> 01:02:42,875
- They're sending a fella over.
- Why?

871
01:02:43,141 --> 01:02:44,369
Why? Because they want your lover.

872
01:02:44,602 --> 01:02:47,753
They wanna put him where he can't
strangle any more women!

873
01:02:48,064 --> 01:02:50,624
And you'd better help 'em.
The sooner he's behind bars the better.

874
01:02:50,903 --> 01:02:52,495
Don't you talk about him like that!

875
01:02:52,739 --> 01:02:55,333
You don't realise how lucky
you are to be alive!

876
01:02:55,617 --> 01:02:59,166
Christ Almighty, Babs, if I wasn't
shorthanded, I'd take you myself!

877
01:02:59,498 --> 01:03:02,535
- As it is, right after closing time -
- I won't be here!

878
01:03:02,837 --> 01:03:03,872
<i>You can stuff your rotten job
right up your jacksie!</i>

879
01:03:04,005 --> 01:03:05,154
<i>- Come back, you!
- Oh, balls!</i>

880
01:03:13,518 --> 01:03:15,076
Got a place to stay?

881
01:03:15,312 --> 01:03:18,190
<i>- Oh, it's you, Bob.
- Yeah.</i>

882
01:03:18,485 --> 01:03:21,557
- I heard you argue with Forsythe.
- Oh, he's a right bastard.

883
01:03:21,863 --> 01:03:23,854
Of course he is.

884
01:03:30,625 --> 01:03:34,584
You can stay at my place 'til you get
something sorted out... if you want.

885
01:03:34,923 --> 01:03:37,391
I won't be in your way.
I'm going up north for a few days.

886
01:03:37,677 --> 01:03:40,475
- No strings?
- Do I look like that sort of a bloke?

887
01:03:40,765 --> 01:03:43,996
All blokes are that sort of a bloke.

888
01:03:44,311 --> 01:03:46,871
- Are you really goin' away?
- Sure! Tonight.

889
01:03:47,149 --> 01:03:49,982
You can have the place to yourself.
I'll take you there now.

890
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:52,874
If you like, I'll go back to the Globe
and pick up your stuff for you.

891
01:03:53,158 --> 01:03:55,194
Now, I can't say fairer than that, can I?

892
01:03:55,452 --> 01:03:58,250
Oh, thanks, Bob. I'll just stay
the one night if you don't mind.

893
01:03:58,541 --> 01:04:01,533
- Suit yourself
- Tomorrow, I'm gonna go to, um...

894
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:04,477
I'm going to my sister in Southall.

895
01:04:04,758 --> 01:04:06,555
Leaving your boyfriend
in the lurch a bit, aren't you?

896
01:04:06,803 --> 01:04:08,873
He has to make up
his own mind what to do.

897
01:04:09,138 --> 01:04:12,175
I'd like to help him if I could.
Where's he hiding out?

898
01:04:12,478 --> 01:04:14,514
- Can't tell you, Bob. I promised.
- Ohh!

899
01:04:14,771 --> 01:04:18,081
Come on, Babs. Dick and me have
always been mates. You know that.

900
01:04:18,403 --> 01:04:20,041
I can't.

901
01:04:20,279 --> 01:04:24,067
Alright. Keep your little secret.

902
01:04:24,411 --> 01:04:28,689
Changing jobs can be a blessing in disguise.
It gets you out of a rut.

903
01:04:29,042 --> 01:04:32,079
A girl like you ought to travel,
see the world a bit.

904
01:04:32,381 --> 01:04:35,532
The Cape, California, Jaffa.
Where the fruit comes from,

905
01:04:35,844 --> 01:04:38,119
that's where I'd like to go
if I wasn't tied down here.

906
01:04:38,389 --> 01:04:40,619
But you, you can do as you please!

907
01:04:40,892 --> 01:04:44,009
You've got the whole
of your life ahead of you.

908
01:04:46,693 --> 01:04:49,207
Here we are. I'm on the second floor.

909
01:05:08,724 --> 01:05:11,397
I don't know if you know it, Babs,

910
01:05:11,688 --> 01:05:14,839
<i>but you're my type of woman.</i>

911
01:05:50,909 --> 01:05:52,900
<i>(Footsteps, Cars Passing)</i>

912
01:06:18,491 --> 01:06:21,642
<i>- (Mrs Oxford) Is that you, Tim?
- Hello, dear.</i>

913
01:06:21,952 --> 01:06:24,591
<i>- Hungry?
- Yes!</i>

914
01:06:24,874 --> 01:06:27,547
Good. I'll bring it right in.

915
01:06:30,090 --> 01:06:33,127
It's a soupe de poisson, dear.

916
01:06:33,428 --> 01:06:36,625
<i>- I know you'll enjoy it.
- I have no doubt of it.</i>

917
01:06:37,309 --> 01:06:40,301
Don't wait for me. I'm just going
to see to the next course.

918
01:06:44,069 --> 01:06:48,699
Well... what's new in the case?
Any sensational breaks?

919
01:06:49,075 --> 01:06:53,785
No. I'll be glad when we get
Mr Richard Blaney inside, though.

920
01:06:54,167 --> 01:06:56,840
Any idea where he is?

921
01:06:59,091 --> 01:07:02,163
No, our only lead to him
left her job this morning.

922
01:07:02,468 --> 01:07:06,700
<i>- I don't know where she is either.
- You're certain he's the one?</i>

923
01:07:07,059 --> 01:07:09,448
Oh, yes, he's... the one, alright.

924
01:07:09,730 --> 01:07:11,766
There's not even the complication
of another suspect.

925
01:07:12,023 --> 01:07:14,014
<i>It has to be him.</i>

926
01:07:19,243 --> 01:07:22,076
We have him identified as leaving
the matrimonial agency

927
01:07:22,375 --> 01:07:24,969
at the time his ex was killed.

928
01:07:25,251 --> 01:07:29,403
We have the clothes which he sent
off to the cleaners in a hurry.

929
01:07:29,759 --> 01:07:32,398
And we have the evidence of the face powder

930
01:07:32,679 --> 01:07:33,998
and the Salvation Army hostel.

931
01:07:34,850 --> 01:07:36,647
I don't follow you, my dear.

932
01:07:36,893 --> 01:07:39,691
I didn't think the Salvation Army
girls used makeup.

933
01:07:40,984 --> 01:07:45,421
No, Blaney slept in a Salvation Army
hostel the night before last.

934
01:07:45,781 --> 01:07:47,772
<i>- Did he, dear?
- Yes.</i>

935
01:07:51,038 --> 01:07:53,871
He was incautious enough
to tell them his name.

936
01:07:54,168 --> 01:07:56,557
I don't think an ex-RAF officer
would sleep in such a place

937
01:07:56,839 --> 01:07:59,831
<i>- unless he was broke, do you?
- No, I don't.</i>

938
01:08:00,136 --> 01:08:02,889
So, let's assume he was.

939
01:08:04,181 --> 01:08:07,093
Last night, however, he slept in the...

940
01:08:07,396 --> 01:08:08,829
Coburg Hotel in Bayswater,

941
01:08:09,066 --> 01:08:13,582
and paid for his extremely expensive
room with a ten-pound note.

942
01:08:14,572 --> 01:08:17,564
The note bore traces
of Mrs Blaney's face powder.

943
01:08:17,869 --> 01:08:20,702
I mean, the murderer
not only strangled Mrs Blaney,

944
01:08:20,998 --> 01:08:22,989
he stole money from her handbag as well.

945
01:08:23,254 --> 01:08:28,203
Ergo... Blaney is the thief
and also the murderer.

946
01:08:29,469 --> 01:08:31,221
That ties it up then.

947
01:08:31,471 --> 01:08:33,939
Well, I think so.

948
01:08:35,269 --> 01:08:37,703
And furthermore, there is a waitress

949
01:08:37,980 --> 01:08:40,016
at Mrs Blaney's club who can also testify

950
01:08:40,276 --> 01:08:43,393
to Blaney's aggressive behaviour
towards his wife the previous night.

951
01:08:44,949 --> 01:08:47,463
He doesn't seem to have been
very discreet, does he?

952
01:08:47,746 --> 01:08:51,295
No. Discretion is not traditionally
the strong suit of the psychopath.

953
01:08:51,626 --> 01:08:53,264
Believe me, that's what we're dealing with.

954
01:08:53,502 --> 01:08:56,062
You ought to read his wife's divorce...
petition.

955
01:08:56,342 --> 01:08:58,173
What exactly is in this soup?

956
01:08:58,428 --> 01:09:00,419
Why? Don't you like it?

957
01:09:00,681 --> 01:09:05,152
Mmm! It's delicious.

958
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:06,999
But I find the...

959
01:09:07,231 --> 01:09:10,462
ingredients somewhat mystifying.

960
01:09:10,779 --> 01:09:13,293
They're smelts, ling,

961
01:09:13,573 --> 01:09:15,848
conger eel, John Dory,

962
01:09:16,119 --> 01:09:19,191
pilchards and frog fish.

963
01:09:20,458 --> 01:09:22,733
Now, since that must've been
fairly satisfying,

964
01:09:23,005 --> 01:09:26,884
I thought a simple
roast bird would be enough.

965
01:09:31,432 --> 01:09:33,741
<i>Caille aux raisins.</i>

966
01:09:34,603 --> 01:09:35,592
Hmm?

967
01:09:36,023 --> 01:09:40,096
Quail with... grapes.

968
01:09:40,444 --> 01:09:42,435
Ahh!

969
01:09:46,370 --> 01:09:49,646
- I must say, I'm very worried.
- About Mr Blaney?

970
01:09:49,959 --> 01:09:53,235
<i>Yes. He's gone off with a barmaid
he used to work with.</i>

971
01:09:53,548 --> 01:09:56,665
<i>I think she's in very great danger.</i>

972
01:09:56,970 --> 01:10:00,007
You're wrong, Tim. Absolutely wrong.

973
01:10:00,308 --> 01:10:02,458
<i>It can't be this fellow.</i>

974
01:10:02,727 --> 01:10:04,479
<i>How long did you say he was married?</i>

975
01:10:04,732 --> 01:10:06,609
Ten years.

976
01:10:06,857 --> 01:10:08,734
Well... there you are.

977
01:10:08,988 --> 01:10:12,981
A crime de passion after all that time?

978
01:10:13,325 --> 01:10:16,601
Look at us. We've only been married
eight years,

979

and you can hardly keep
your eyes open at night.

or make you do degrading things.

982
01:10:25,759 --> 01:10:28,068
No, the evidence speaks for itself.

983
01:10:28,347 --> 01:10:32,260
You can't make normal judgments
about psychopathic killers.

It's true, Dicko. It just came over on the radio.

They found her in a potato truck
in Lincolnshire.

The fellow at the pub
where you worked identified her.

He knows where they found her.
He put her there!

It doesn't matter whether
you believe him or not,

1032
01:25:15,029 --> 01:25:17,782
because it said on the radio she had
been dead for at least 12 hours

Yes. Yes, I suppose you can.

There's no supposing. We'll simply
tell the police you were here with us.

now before you go away?

- Of course I would. Delighted.
- You'll do no such thing!

And they have a lot of evidence against him.

1049
01:26:05,934 --> 01:26:09,131
We know he didn't kill her.
We must tell them he was with us.

But we don't know he didn't kill Miss Milligan!

01:26:11,986 --> 01:26:14,580
For all we know the time given
on the radio might've been a trap.

1052
01:26:14,866 --> 01:26:17,539
<i>What is certain, if you go to the police,</i>

1053
01:26:17,829 --> 01:26:20,707
they will probably charge you with
being an accessory after the fact.

1054
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,319
And they certainly
won't allow us to go abroad,

1055
01:26:22,542 --> 01:26:25,102
and they will probably put us in jail.

1056
01:26:32,559 --> 01:26:37,428
Well, Hetty's right, dammit.
You can see that, Dicko, can't you?

1057
01:26:37,815 --> 01:26:39,806
You mean you won't come
to the police with me?

1058
01:26:40,068 --> 01:26:43,378
- How can I? You heard Hetty.
- You're my only alibi!

1059
01:26:43,699 --> 01:26:47,009
I'm sorry. I've got to get to Paris today.
I can't afford to be kept here.

1060
01:26:47,327 --> 01:26:49,522
But you can afford to stand by
and see me go to jail for life!

1061
01:26:49,790 --> 01:26:51,303
<i>- Is that it?
- It's not as bad as that.</i>

1062
01:26:51,544 --> 01:26:53,375
I mean, they'll find this strangler chappie.

1063
01:26:53,629 --> 01:26:55,028
Of all the cowardly shits!

1064
01:26:55,257 --> 01:26:58,055
<i>It's "I'm alright Jack,
and haul up the ladder," isn't it?</i>

1065
01:26:58,344 --> 01:27:00,335
You pair of bastards!

1066
01:27:00,597 --> 01:27:03,589
If that's how you feel after all we've
done for you, you better had go!

1067
01:27:03,895 --> 01:27:05,613
I'll call the manager.

1068
01:27:05,855 --> 01:27:09,165
And involve yourself? Don't worry, I'm going.

1069
01:27:09,484 --> 01:27:13,762
I'm a little choosy with whom
I spend my last hours of freedom.

1070
01:27:14,116 --> 01:27:18,394
Look, I'm sorry. I'd suggest that you
came to Paris and worked in a pub,

1071
01:27:18,749 --> 01:27:21,786
but they're watching all the ports
and stations. It said so on the news.

1072
01:27:22,088 --> 01:27:24,283
Well, that lets you out then, doesn't it?

1073
01:27:24,548 --> 01:27:26,539
Your responsibility for me ends here.

1074
01:27:31,390 --> 01:27:34,462
<i>Clear this area, please. Thank you, madam.
Stand back, please.</i>

1075
01:27:37,484 --> 01:27:39,759
Looks as though we've got half
the law in London in the market.

1076
01:27:40,030 --> 01:27:43,579
Yeah. It makes it very difficult
to give short weight.

1077
01:27:43,909 --> 01:27:44,898
I suppose they're trying to find out

1078
01:27:45,119 --> 01:27:48,475
if anybody saw Blaney put
Babs on that potato truck.

1079
01:27:48,789 --> 01:27:51,701
- You think he did it, do you?
- It stands to reason, doesn't it?

1080
01:27:52,003 --> 01:27:52,992
Why? Don't you?

1081
01:27:53,215 --> 01:27:55,968
I'm not as eager as some
to turn on my old mates.

1082
01:27:56,259 --> 01:27:58,773
What are you talkin' about?
Blaney wasn't a mate of mine.

1083
01:27:59,056 --> 01:28:01,126
- I had to sack him for stealin'.
- Get off.

1084
01:28:01,391 --> 01:28:04,030
Yeah, Blaney was a thief, right bastard.

1085
01:28:04,314 --> 01:28:07,306
I even told that Chief Inspector,
but he didn't believe a word, did he?

1086
01:28:07,609 --> 01:28:09,600
I expect he's laughing
on the other side of his face now.

1087
01:28:09,863 --> 01:28:12,377
- You reckon?
- Yeah, definitely, definitely.

1088
01:28:12,660 --> 01:28:15,777
He wasn't so cocky
when I saw him at 7:00 this morning.

1089
01:28:16,079 --> 01:28:18,673
I've just been down
to Scotland Yard to identify her.

1090
01:28:18,959 --> 01:28:23,635
From photos. They took 'em
and they rushed 'em down special.

1091
01:28:24,008 --> 01:28:27,603
- She wasn't a pretty sight.
- Some people have all the luck.

1092
01:28:27,930 --> 01:28:29,409
Yeah. I better get a move on.

1093
01:28:29,640 --> 01:28:32,837
Business will be pretty brisk today.
You know how morbid people are.

1094
01:28:33,147 --> 01:28:36,378
Absolutely! Jumping up to identify
dead girls at all hours of the night.

1095
01:28:36,694 --> 01:28:38,685
See you later.

1096
01:28:44,161 --> 01:28:46,152
My God, Dick!

1097
01:28:48,879 --> 01:28:50,870
Whatcha doin' here?

1098
01:28:51,130 --> 01:28:53,325
I'm sorry, Bob,
but I had nowhere else to go.

1099
01:28:53,593 --> 01:28:55,948
The people I was staying
with left for Paris this morning.

1100
01:28:56,219 --> 01:28:59,768
I wouldn't have come, but you did
say if I needed anything, anytime...

1101
01:29:00,102 --> 01:29:03,458
Yes, of course! But you took a hell
of a chance coming here today.

1102
01:29:03,774 --> 01:29:07,084
The whole place is teeming with coppers.
Wait a minute.

1103
01:29:11,324 --> 01:29:15,203
You'd better hole up in my place for
a day or two 'til we sort something.

1104
01:29:15,540 --> 01:29:18,338
Yes. I thought maybe if you had the room.

1105
01:29:18,628 --> 01:29:21,301
I know it's a hell of an imposition
getting you involved and everything.

1106
01:29:21,590 --> 01:29:24,821
<i>You've got to believe me.
I haven't murdered anyone!</i>

1107
01:29:25,136 --> 01:29:27,934
This whole business is insane! You know me.

1108
01:29:28,225 --> 01:29:32,423
<i>- I wouldn't do anything like this.
- Of course you wouldn't. No.</i>

1109
01:29:32,773 --> 01:29:37,051
The police, as usual, have got
the whole thing arse about face.

1110
01:29:37,405 --> 01:29:40,283
I mean, these sort of killings
always boggle the mind.

1111
01:29:40,577 --> 01:29:43,853
That man must be a sexual maniac.

1112
01:29:45,206 --> 01:29:49,757
Mind you, there are some women
who ask for everything they get.

1113
01:29:50,131 --> 01:29:53,203
But you? Don't make me laugh.
You're not the type.

1114
01:29:53,510 --> 01:29:55,501
Now... don't worry.

1115
01:29:55,763 --> 01:29:59,551
<i>You've done the right thing
coming to your Uncle Bob.</i>

1116
01:29:59,896 --> 01:30:02,490
Right. Well, let's get over to
my place. You know where it is?

1117
01:30:02,774 --> 01:30:05,083
- Yeah.
- I'll go first, and I'll take the bag.

1118
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:07,351
- Then you'll be less conspicuous.
- OK.

1119
01:30:07,614 --> 01:30:10,208
You follow, but go the long way.
Go down to the Strand, you know.

1120
01:30:10,493 --> 01:30:12,609
And then work your way up
Southampton Street. OK?

1121
01:30:12,872 --> 01:30:14,863
Yeah.

1122
01:31:37,575 --> 01:31:40,248
Well done, boy! Come in.

1123
01:31:40,539 --> 01:31:42,814
Make yourself comfortable.

1124
01:31:43,085 --> 01:31:46,555
- Very cozy.
- Yes, well, it's my little nest.

1125
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:48,871
You know, my home.

1126
01:31:49,135 --> 01:31:51,330
The place where when you have
to go there, they have to take you in.

1127
01:31:51,595 --> 01:31:54,428
That's what my ol' mum used to say.
You met my mum, didn't you?

1128
01:31:54,725 --> 01:31:58,354
<i>- Yes.
- Ah, great old lady.</i>

1129
01:31:58,689 --> 01:32:01,999
<i>- I'm off to the shop. See you later!
- Yeah, sure.</i>

1130
01:32:02,319 --> 01:32:04,310
There's something to eat in the kitchen.
The booze is here.

1131
01:32:04,573 --> 01:32:06,564
<i>So get on with it, right?</i>

1132
01:32:06,825 --> 01:32:10,579
Bob, I'm really grateful for all this.
You know that.

1133
01:32:10,916 --> 01:32:12,986
<i>I told you, think nothing of it.</i>

1134
01:32:13,253 --> 01:32:15,209
Hey, do me a favour, will you?

1135
01:32:15,464 --> 01:32:18,695
<i>- Keep away from the windows.
- Yes, of course. Sorry.</i>

1136
01:32:19,009 --> 01:32:20,727
Ta-ta.

1137
01:32:20,971 --> 01:32:23,041
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

1138
01:32:52,975 --> 01:32:54,966
<i>(Door Opens)</i>

1139
01:32:55,230 --> 01:32:56,822
Are you Richard lan Blaney?

1140
01:32:57,065 --> 01:32:59,056
- Yes. What is this?
- You're under arrest.

1141
01:32:59,317 --> 01:33:00,306
Come quietly, and you won't get hurt.

1142
01:33:00,529 --> 01:33:03,043
- Is this necessary?
- We're careful with you bastards.

1143
01:33:03,324 --> 01:33:04,882
- Is this your bag?
- Yes.

1144
01:33:21,348 --> 01:33:25,341
- Thank you for your help, Mr Rusk.
- Anything to oblige, Sarge.

1145
01:33:25,687 --> 01:33:28,201
No reward, I'm afraid.
Better luck next time, eh?

1146
01:33:28,483 --> 01:33:31,361
You know what they say.
"Virtue is its own reward."

1147
01:33:31,656 --> 01:33:35,569
I... Well, if you want any more help,
I'll be in my shop.

1148
01:33:35,912 --> 01:33:37,664
Alright. We know where you are.

1149
01:33:43,381 --> 01:33:46,851
How's that kid of yours
gettin' on with the violin?

- Richard lan Blaney?
- Yes.

1151
01:33:57,108 --> 01:33:59,861
As the result of my inquiries,
you'll be detained in connection

1152
01:34:00,154 --> 01:34:02,304
with the willful murders
of Brenda Margaret Blaney,

1153
01:34:02,576 --> 01:34:04,931
Barbara Jane Milligan and others.

1154
01:34:05,205 --> 01:34:06,957
You're not obliged to say anything
unless you wish.

1155
01:34:07,206 --> 01:34:09,276
Anything you do say will be
taken down in writing

1156
01:34:09,542 --> 01:34:10,861
and may be used in evidence.

1157
01:34:11,087 --> 01:34:14,363
Mr Oxford, could you
spare a second over here?

Rusk. It's Rusk!

1159
01:34:24,482 --> 01:34:26,791
Hold him back. Where was this found?

1160
01:34:27,068 --> 01:34:30,663
- Over at Henrietta Street.
- Any identification?

1161

"Miss Barbara Milligan, Globe Public House."

We are.

guilty or not guilty of the murder of Brenda...

<i>... lan Blaney,</i>

you have been found guilty
of a terrible crime.

1169
01:35:19,893 --> 01:35:23,329
On its ghastly and wicked
nature I will not dwell.

1170
01:35:23,648 --> 01:35:26,765
I only tell you that you must
entertain no expectation or hope

that you will escape the consequences of it.

01:37:20,650 --> 01:37:22,049
(Monica) Yes, Inspector, I remember him well.

1196
01:37:22,275 --> 01:37:24,266
He came here on two or three occasions.

1197
01:37:24,530 --> 01:37:27,840
Every business has its own
special cross to bear, I suppose.

1198
01:37:28,200 --> 01:37:30,839
- And yours is men like this?
- That is so.

1199
01:37:31,124 --> 01:37:34,321
Most of them are easy enough to get
rid of, but Mr Robinson here

1200
01:37:34,628 --> 01:37:36,107
<i>was particularly insistent.</i>

1201
01:37:36,338 --> 01:37:39,171
<i>- He wouldn't take no for an answer.
- Mr Robinson?</i>

1202
01:37:39,468 --> 01:37:41,459
Yes, that is the man's name.

1203
01:37:48,941 --> 01:37:50,135
<i>Here we are.</i>

1204
01:37:50,358 --> 01:37:53,395
Mr William Robinson.

1205
01:37:53,696 --> 01:37:58,087
You see, Inspector, he wanted us to
find women for him who enjoyed,

1206
01:37:58,453 --> 01:38:01,365
well... certain peculiarities.

1207
01:38:01,667 --> 01:38:05,057
Who were sexual masochists?
Who enjoyed being hurt?

1208
01:38:05,380 --> 01:38:07,814
<i>- That sort of thing?
- Quite.</i>

1209
01:38:08,093 --> 01:38:10,243
Perhaps you'd better see it for yourself.

1210
01:38:10,511 --> 01:38:15,141
Naturally we told him we couldn't oblige,
but he kept coming back.

1211
01:38:15,519 --> 01:38:16,588
Is it likely, do you think,

1212
01:38:16,812 --> 01:38:20,202
that if Mr Robinson couldn't get
what he wanted from your agency,

1213
01:38:20,527 --> 01:38:23,644
<i>- he would go to others?
- Oh, yes, very likely.</i>

1214
01:38:23,949 --> 01:38:26,224
Men like this leave no stone unturned

1215
01:38:26,494 --> 01:38:29,008
in their search for their
disgusting gratifications.

1216
01:38:33,714 --> 01:38:35,386
Excuse me, Inspector.

1217
01:38:35,632 --> 01:38:38,783
Do you have any special reason
for seeing Mr Robinson?

1218
01:38:39,095 --> 01:38:43,805
Yes, Miss Barling. And I'd like you
to keep my visit confidential.

1219
01:38:44,185 --> 01:38:46,176
Of course.

1220
01:39:03,838 --> 01:39:07,194
<i>(Guard) Get the doctor quick.
Looks like an ambulance job.</i>

1221
01:39:07,511 --> 01:39:09,502
(Sirens Wailing)

1222
01:39:33,214 --> 01:39:36,490
I told you it wasn't Blaney, didn't I?

1223
01:39:36,802 --> 01:39:39,760
I told you you were on the wrong track.

1224
01:39:40,057 --> 01:39:43,811
A woman's intuition is worth more
than all those laboratories.

1225
01:39:44,147 --> 01:39:46,900
I can't think why you don't
teach it in police colleges.

1226
01:39:47,191 --> 01:39:49,830
So you think it's Rusk, do you?
You think he's our man?

1227
01:39:50,113 --> 01:39:52,502
Well, of course. Anyone can see that.

1228
01:39:52,783 --> 01:39:55,013
He knew both Mrs Blaney

1229
01:39:55,288 --> 01:39:57,927
- and that Barbara what's-her-name.
- Yes.

1230
01:39:58,207 --> 01:40:00,198
Well, there you are.

1231
01:40:00,460 --> 01:40:02,610
You told me the man's a sexual pervert.

1232
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:06,031
That's why he kept the clothes
and put them in Mr Blaney's case.

1233
01:40:06,344 --> 01:40:08,335
We have no proof of that.

1234
01:40:08,598 --> 01:40:10,953
It stands to reason.

1235
01:40:11,229 --> 01:40:13,220
Don't you mean intuition?

1236
01:40:14,647 --> 01:40:17,764
What does your intuition tell you
I want for dinner tonight?

1237
01:40:18,071 --> 01:40:20,460
Steak and a baked potato.

1238
01:40:20,738 --> 01:40:25,892
But you're getting
pied de porc  la mode de Caens.

1239
01:40:27,332 --> 01:40:29,766
<i>- (Oxford) It looks like a pig's foot!
- That's what it is.</i>

1240
01:40:30,045 --> 01:40:33,958
I put it in the same sauce
the French use for tripe.

1241
01:40:34,301 --> 01:40:36,292
That's comforting.

1242
01:40:36,554 --> 01:40:38,670
Well, when are you going to arrest

1243
01:40:38,932 --> 01:40:42,129
this Mr Robinson, or Rusk,
or whatever he's called?

1244
01:40:42,438 --> 01:40:44,030
<i>When I have the proof I need.</i>

1245
01:40:44,274 --> 01:40:49,109
<i>- It takes longer than intuition.
- When will you have it?</i>

1246
01:40:49,989 --> 01:40:52,059
In a few minutes I hope, dear.

1247
01:40:52,325 --> 01:40:54,475
Really?

1248
01:40:54,746 --> 01:40:57,499
You old slyboots. Tell.

1249
01:40:59,628 --> 01:41:01,937
Well...

1250
01:41:07,599 --> 01:41:10,636
we know that if Rusk is the murderer,

1251
01:41:10,937 --> 01:41:13,531
he traveled up in a potato truck
with his victim.

1252
01:41:13,815 --> 01:41:15,567
How do we know that?

1253
01:41:15,819 --> 01:41:19,494
Did you ever hear of a corpse
that cut itself out of a tied sack?

1254
01:41:19,824 --> 01:41:23,339
<i>What would he want to take
the corpse out of the sack for?</i>

1255
01:41:23,663 --> 01:41:25,654
Obviously he was looking for something.

1256
01:41:25,915 --> 01:41:28,145
How do we know that?

1257
01:41:28,419 --> 01:41:30,535
The corpse was deep in rigor mortis.

1258
01:41:30,798 --> 01:41:34,268
He had to break the fingers of the
right hand to obtain what they held.

1259
01:41:34,595 --> 01:41:36,586
(Cracking)

1260
01:41:38,725 --> 01:41:41,558
It would be so nice to get back
to plain bread in this house.

1261
01:41:41,856 --> 01:41:44,051
What do you think they held?

1262
01:41:44,317 --> 01:41:47,468
A locket? A broach? A cross!

1263
01:41:47,780 --> 01:41:50,613
It had to be something
that would incriminate him.

1264
01:41:50,909 --> 01:41:53,707
Something that he missed
when he put the body on the truck.

1265
01:41:53,999 --> 01:41:56,388
A monogrammed handkerchief, perhaps.

1266
01:41:56,671 --> 01:41:58,662
Not a cross, I think.

1267
01:41:58,922 --> 01:42:01,356
Well...

1268
01:42:01,635 --> 01:42:03,830
I don't see why not.

1269
01:42:04,096 --> 01:42:09,124
Religious and sexual mania are closely linked.

1270
01:42:10,563 --> 01:42:13,953
Anyway, whatever it was, he found it,

1271
01:42:14,278 --> 01:42:16,508
which was unlucky for us.

1272
01:42:16,781 --> 01:42:20,660
But we did have one piece of good fortune.

1273
01:42:20,994 --> 01:42:25,545
The truck driver told us that he
stopped at one place on his journey,

1274
01:42:25,918 --> 01:42:29,069
and that was at a pull-in
somewhere out of London.

1275
01:42:29,381 --> 01:42:30,939
- A pull-in?
- Hmm.

1276
01:42:32,262 --> 01:42:36,699
It's a... cafe frequented by truck drivers, dear.

1277
01:42:37,060 --> 01:42:40,450
They serve humble foods
like bacon and egg sandwiches,

1278
01:42:40,771 --> 01:42:45,242
sausages and mashed potatoes
and cups of tea and coffee.

1279
01:42:46,825 --> 01:42:49,385
How is it so fortunate
that this driver stopped there?

1280
01:42:51,206 --> 01:42:52,844
It's not so much that he stopped,

1281
01:42:53,083 --> 01:42:56,314
but that he stopped
only once that is important.

1282
01:42:56,628 --> 01:42:59,586
The only place our man could've
got out of the truck was at that cafe.

1283
01:42:59,883 --> 01:43:01,475
I sent Sergeant Spearman to see

1284
01:43:01,719 --> 01:43:04,711
if he could find anyone who
could remember Rusk being there.

1285
01:43:05,016 --> 01:43:07,735
I'm expecting him back at any minute.

1286
01:43:08,019 --> 01:43:11,170
Well, eat up, dear. You'll want
to be finished by the time he arrives.

1287
01:43:12,275 --> 01:43:14,709
Tasty, very tasty.

1288
01:43:14,988 --> 01:43:17,343
Not a lot of meat on it, mind.

1289
01:43:17,618 --> 01:43:19,176
No sense in gorging, dear.

1290
01:43:19,412 --> 01:43:23,769
I'll take mine and eat it while I'm
beating my eggs for the souffl.

1291
01:43:24,127 --> 01:43:26,118
<i>(Doorbell Rings)</i>

1292
01:43:29,718 --> 01:43:31,037
- Good evening, Sergeant.
- Good evening, sir.

1293
01:43:31,261 --> 01:43:33,729
- Am I interrupting your dinner?
- No, not at all. Come in.

1294
01:43:34,017 --> 01:43:36,531
- Thank you, sir.
- Put your hat and coat on the sofa.

1295
01:43:39,399 --> 01:43:43,028
Good evening, Sergeant Spearman.
What would you like to drink?

1296
01:43:43,363 --> 01:43:45,638
Good evening, madam. I don't know that I...

1297
01:43:45,907 --> 01:43:47,545
Oh, that's alright. You're off duty.

1298
01:43:47,786 --> 01:43:52,018
How about a Margarita? It's delicious.

1299
01:43:52,376 --> 01:43:54,412
Tequila, triple sec,

1300
01:43:54,668 --> 01:43:59,901
<i>fresh lemon juice and... salt
pressed 'round the rim of the glass.</i>

1301
01:44:00,302 --> 01:44:02,657
<i>- You'll love it.
- Thank you, madam.</i>

1302
01:44:06,813 --> 01:44:09,885
Sergeant Spearman, you are positively
glutinous with self-approbation.

1303
01:44:10,193 --> 01:44:12,343
- You might as well speak out.
- Yes, sir.

1304
01:44:12,613 --> 01:44:14,604
The woman behind the counter at the cafe

1305
01:44:14,867 --> 01:44:17,540
positively identified Rusk
from the photo I showed her

1306
01:44:17,828 --> 01:44:20,820
as being a man who was at the cafe
the night the body was discovered.

1307
01:44:21,125 --> 01:44:22,843
And that's not all.

1308
01:44:23,085 --> 01:44:27,283
- Are you waiting for a drumroll?
- No, sir. Sorry, sir.

1309
01:44:27,635 --> 01:44:30,707
The woman also said that Rusk was
dishevelled and very dusty,

1310
01:44:31,014 --> 01:44:34,165
and asked to borrow a clothes brush.

1311
01:44:41,781 --> 01:44:43,931
This is the brush she lent him, sir.

1312
01:44:44,200 --> 01:44:48,398
- You see there?
- (Sniffs)

1313
01:44:48,750 --> 01:44:51,901
What do you say, Spearman? Potato dust?

1314
01:44:53,254 --> 01:44:55,688
Here you are, Sergeant.

1315
01:44:57,009 --> 01:44:58,522
Cheers.

1316
01:44:58,761 --> 01:45:01,992
- Cheers, madam.
- Did you hear all that?

1317
01:45:02,310 --> 01:45:06,542
<i>- Yes, I told you. I knew all the time.
- (Oxford) Quite.</i>

1318
01:45:06,897 --> 01:45:10,207
- Get this down to the lab quickly.
- Very good, sir.

1319
01:45:11,404 --> 01:45:14,077
It rather looks like we put
the wrong man away this time.

1320
01:45:14,366 --> 01:45:18,075
What do you mean "we"? You put him away.

1321
01:45:18,414 --> 01:45:21,133
- All right, Spearman, you can go.
- Good night, madam.

1322
01:45:21,420 --> 01:45:22,739
You haven't finished your drink.

1323
01:45:22,962 --> 01:45:26,034
I'm sorry. I have to get
down to the lab in a hurry.

1324
01:45:26,343 --> 01:45:28,334
Good night, Spearman. Good work.

1325
01:45:28,596 --> 01:45:30,587
- Very good work.
- Thank you, sir.

1326
01:45:36,314 --> 01:45:40,865
Poor Mr Blaney. You've got
to get him out, Tim, immediately.

1327
01:45:41,240 --> 01:45:43,356
He's in hospital at the moment.

1328
01:45:43,617 --> 01:45:46,131
I'll talk to the assistant
commissioner in the morning

1329
01:45:46,413 --> 01:45:47,732
and get the case reopened.

1330
01:45:47,957 --> 01:45:51,313
He won't like it, but there's
quite enough evidence for a pardon.

1331
01:45:51,629 --> 01:45:53,938
Will they give him any compensation?

1332
01:45:54,215 --> 01:45:55,250
I expect they'll give him some money,

1333
01:45:55,468 --> 01:45:59,381
but there's no real way
to compensate in cases like these.

1334
01:45:59,724 --> 01:46:01,715
Poor man.

1335
01:46:03,188 --> 01:46:07,704
I think the least you can do is ask
him 'round for a really good dinner.

1336
01:46:08,696 --> 01:46:10,015
<i>Let's see.</i>

1337
01:46:10,236 --> 01:46:13,273
<i>It will obviously have
to be something substantial.</i>

1338
01:46:14,204 --> 01:46:19,119
I think a Caneton aux cerises.

1339
01:46:20,338 --> 01:46:22,215
<i>- What's that?
- Duckling...</i>

1340
01:46:22,465 --> 01:46:25,423
with heavy sweet cherry sauce.

1341
01:46:27,180 --> 01:46:31,412
After that jail food he's been having,
I expect he'll eat anything.

1342
01:46:38,236 --> 01:46:39,715
Excuse me.

1343
01:46:39,946 --> 01:46:43,063
I must see if my souffl's started to rise.

1344
01:47:11,742 --> 01:47:14,620
Hey! Are the pills working?

1345
01:47:23,719 --> 01:47:26,233
- He's sleeping like a baby.
- Do you think we gave him enough?

1346
01:47:27,640 --> 01:47:29,073
Christ, mate, he's had half a dozen.

1347
01:47:30,771 --> 01:47:33,365
Good. Now I'm off to get that bastard Rusk!

1348
01:47:33,650 --> 01:47:35,606
Alright, alright. Let's make sure.

1349
01:47:35,861 --> 01:47:38,694
It's now or never!
I'm due back inside tomorrow.

1350
01:47:39,532 --> 01:47:40,601
George? George!

1351
01:47:40,826 --> 01:47:43,135
<i>Alright, George?</i>

1352
01:48:10,411 --> 01:48:13,642
Right, son, better be going.
Mind you do him up good.

1353
01:48:13,958 --> 01:48:15,789
Here, take this strip of mica.

1354
01:48:16,043 --> 01:48:18,921
You may need it to open his door.

1355
01:48:22,843 --> 01:48:24,834
(Knocking)

1356
01:48:37,532 --> 01:48:39,204
Doctor? Sister?

1357
01:48:52,305 --> 01:48:53,863
Get a trolley, nurse.

1358
01:49:01,358 --> 01:49:04,395
(Doctor) Sister, there seems to be
no evidence of a cerebral accident.

1359
01:49:04,905 --> 01:49:07,100
<i>We'll have to admit him for observation
and then sort him out.</i>

1360
01:49:07,533 --> 01:49:09,444
<i>(Nurse) Could he be an epileptic or diabetic?</i>

1361
01:49:09,705 --> 01:49:11,855
<i>(Doctor) Not very likely in his sort of job.</i>

1362
01:49:12,125 --> 01:49:14,798
<i>We're certainly going to need blood samples.</i>

1363
01:49:22,721 --> 01:49:26,031
<i>Sleeping pills!
They've given him all their sleeping pills.</i>

1364
01:49:35,408 --> 01:49:37,046
- Good night.
- Good night, sir.

1365
01:50:24,018 --> 01:50:26,009
<i>(Alarm Ringing)</i>

1366
01:50:29,568 --> 01:50:31,559
<i>(Alarm Continues)</i>

1367
01:50:45,966 --> 01:50:47,957
(Engine Revving)

1368
01:50:56,147 --> 01:50:58,138
<i>(Phone Ringing)</i>

1369
01:50:59,360 --> 01:51:01,112
Hello?

1370
01:51:01,821 --> 01:51:03,698
Good God! When was this?

1371
01:51:03,950 --> 01:51:05,827
Right. What's that?

1372
01:51:06,536 --> 01:51:08,925
Yes. Five minutes. I'll wait outside.

1373
01:51:09,835 --> 01:51:13,066
I'm off! Blaney's escaped,
and I bet I know where he's gone.

1374
01:51:16,510 --> 01:51:19,263
I often wondered whether Blaney
threw himself down those stairs

1375
01:51:19,555 --> 01:51:21,830
in a suicide attempt,
or just as a means to get into the hospital.

1376
01:51:22,100 --> 01:51:23,818
Now, of course, we have our answer.

1377
01:54:18,896 --> 01:54:20,648
No. No!

1378
01:54:20,900 --> 01:54:24,495
<i>- It's not -
- (Thumping Noise)</i>

1379
01:54:28,825 --> 01:54:31,293
<i>(Thumping Continues)</i>

1380
01:54:54,111 --> 01:54:56,261
Mr Rusk.

1381
01:54:56,949 --> 01:54:59,907
You're not wearing your tie.

1382
01:55:01,080 --> 01:55:03,071
I -
