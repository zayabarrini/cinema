1
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,812
Daddy, you're sure
I've never been to Africa before?

2
00:03:24,979 --> 00:03:27,523
It looks familiar.

3
00:03:27,648 --> 00:03:31,069
You saw the same scenery last summer
driving to Las Vegas.

4
00:03:31,194 --> 00:03:34,405
Oh, sure. Where Daddy lost all
that money at the crap -

5
00:03:34,531 --> 00:03:37,409
- Hank!
- Table.

6
00:03:37,534 --> 00:03:40,704
Hey, look! A camel!

7
00:03:43,999 --> 00:03:47,461
Uh-huh. Course this isn't really Africa.
It's the French Morocco.

8
00:03:47,628 --> 00:03:49,463
Well, it's Northern Africa.

9
00:03:49,588 --> 00:03:51,424
Still seems like Las Vegas.

10
00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:55,094
We're just a hundred miles
north of the Sahara Desert.

11
00:03:55,219 --> 00:03:58,890
I don't know. In school they
call this the Dark Continent.

12
00:03:59,015 --> 00:04:01,309
This is twice as bright as Indianapolis.

13
00:04:01,476 --> 00:04:03,603
You just wait till we get to Marrakech.

14
00:04:03,728 --> 00:04:08,734
- Marrakech? Sounds like a drink.
- Mmm. It sure does.

15
00:04:41,644 --> 00:04:44,147
Wait a minute. Hold on there.
What's the matter?

16
00:05:05,419 --> 00:05:07,755
Well, I sure want to thank you.

17
00:05:07,922 --> 00:05:10,216
Without your help,
anything might have happened here.

18
00:05:10,383 --> 00:05:12,218
My pleasure, monsieur.

19
00:05:12,343 --> 00:05:14,929
There are moments in life
when we all need a little help.

20
00:05:15,096 --> 00:05:18,058
Yeah. Just what was the trouble?

21
00:05:18,183 --> 00:05:21,520
Uh... your little boy accidentally
pulled off his wife's veil.

22
00:05:21,645 --> 00:05:23,689
- Oh. Yeah.
- Hank!

23
00:05:23,814 --> 00:05:25,649
I want to introduce my wife,
Mrs McKenna.

24
00:05:25,774 --> 00:05:27,443
- How do you do?
- How do you do, madame?

25
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:29,069
My name is Louis Bernard.

26
00:05:29,236 --> 00:05:31,614
We thank you very much, Mr Bernard.

27
00:05:31,781 --> 00:05:33,991
- That's our son, Hank.
- Hello, Hank.

28
00:05:34,116 --> 00:05:36,160
Hello. You talk Arab talk.

29
00:05:36,285 --> 00:05:38,121
A few words.

30
00:05:38,288 --> 00:05:40,457
Why was he angry? It was an accident.

31
00:05:40,623 --> 00:05:44,753
But the Muslim religion
allows for few accidents.

32
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:46,755
- Yeah, I suppose so.
- Oh.

33
00:05:46,922 --> 00:05:49,758
- May I?
- Yeah, sit down right in front of Jo.

34
00:05:50,592 --> 00:05:53,345
Oh, I thought his name was Hank.

35
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:55,431
Oh, it's my wife's name.

36
00:05:55,556 --> 00:05:57,725
- J-O. No E.
- How different.

37
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:59,685
Short for Josephine.

38
00:05:59,811 --> 00:06:02,939
I've called her that so long
nobody knows her by any other name.

39
00:06:03,106 --> 00:06:05,066
- I do. Mommy.
- Oh, yeah.

40
00:06:05,233 --> 00:06:07,736
Now, about the accident.

41
00:06:07,861 --> 00:06:12,157
A Muslim woman never takes off her veil
in public under any circumstances.

42
00:06:12,324 --> 00:06:14,243
They feed her intravenously?

43
00:06:14,368 --> 00:06:17,788
- No, Hank.
- What a big word for such a small boy.

44
00:06:17,955 --> 00:06:19,790
I'm a doctor.

45
00:06:19,957 --> 00:06:22,585
Oh. Well, he sounds like one.

46
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:24,754
He can spell haemoglobin.

47
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:27,840
He has a little trouble
with words like dog and cat.

48
00:06:29,801 --> 00:06:31,761
Where do you practise, doctor?

49
00:06:31,928 --> 00:06:34,931
Indianapolis, Indiana.
Good Samaritan Hospital out there.

50
00:06:35,057 --> 00:06:37,059
What brings you to Marrakech?

51
00:06:37,184 --> 00:06:39,186
We were attending
a medical convention in Paris

52
00:06:39,353 --> 00:06:41,313
and I thought,
inasmuch as we were in Europe,

53
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,899
I'd come and see Morocco again.

54
00:06:44,024 --> 00:06:47,320
Daddy liberated Africa.

55
00:06:47,486 --> 00:06:49,447
I was stationed up in Casablanca

56
00:06:49,614 --> 00:06:52,450
at an army field hospital during the war.

57
00:06:52,575 --> 00:06:55,495
- Do you live in Morocco, Mr Bernard?
- No.

58
00:06:56,162 --> 00:06:58,415
I suppose you came directly from Paris.

59
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,709
No, we looked in on Lisbon and Rome.

60
00:07:00,834 --> 00:07:03,545
- And Casablanca.
- And Casablanca.

61
00:07:04,713 --> 00:07:07,383
I hope you will have time
to truly enjoy Marrakech.

62
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:10,261
Let's see.
We'll have, at the most, three days.

63
00:07:11,053 --> 00:07:15,266
You will, naturally, be stopping
at the Hotel Mamounia or Le Menara?

64
00:07:15,391 --> 00:07:16,935
Why do you ask?

65
00:07:18,019 --> 00:07:21,064
Because they are hotels
for tourists of good taste.

66
00:07:21,231 --> 00:07:24,526
Oh. Do you live in France, Mr Bernard?

67
00:07:24,651 --> 00:07:26,695
- Sometimes.
- Do you eat snails?

68
00:07:26,862 --> 00:07:28,947
When I'm lucky enough.

69
00:07:29,072 --> 00:07:31,909
If you ever get hungry,
our garden back home is full of snails.

70
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:34,036
Thank you for the invitation.

71
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:37,164
That's alright.
We tried everything to get rid of them.

72
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,625
We never thought of a Frenchman.

73
00:08:37,187 --> 00:08:39,189
Here we go.

74
00:08:39,981 --> 00:08:42,526
Say, do you want to
share a taxi with us to the hotel?

75
00:08:42,651 --> 00:08:46,155
That's kind of you, Doctor, but
unfortunately I have some business first.

76
00:08:46,322 --> 00:08:48,741
- Oh. OK.
- What business are you in, Mr Bernard?

77
00:08:48,866 --> 00:08:52,161
I'll be there later and perhaps
we might have a drink together.

78
00:08:52,328 --> 00:08:54,288
Come up to our suite.
We'll have a drink up there.

79
00:08:54,455 --> 00:08:58,042
- In that case, I will take you to dinner.
- No, no. That's not fair.

80
00:08:58,168 --> 00:09:00,962
I know Marrakech.
I can show you an Arab restaurant

81
00:09:01,087 --> 00:09:03,715
where the food is different
and the manner of eating exotic.

82
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,842
That's what we came here for.

83
00:09:05,968 --> 00:09:08,637
- How about one of those Arabian nights?
- I'd love it.

84
00:09:09,555 --> 00:09:13,184
How would you prefer to travel
to the hotel, by taxi?

85
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:16,479
- Gee, I don't know.
- A wagon! I wanna ride in a wagon!

86
00:09:17,396 --> 00:09:20,108
I guess it's a wagon. See you later.

87
00:09:20,233 --> 00:09:22,569
Au revoir. I look forward to the cocktails.

88
00:09:22,694 --> 00:09:25,155
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

89
00:09:26,531 --> 00:09:28,658
Hank, you sit up with the driver.

90
00:09:29,618 --> 00:09:32,830
How do you like this?
A horse-drawn convertible.

91
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:49,222
Well, I just saw Louis Bernard
talking to that Arab.

92
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:51,349
- What Arab?
- The one that was shouting at Hank.

93
00:09:51,516 --> 00:09:53,769
They were talking like
they were dear friends.

94
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:55,896
Well, he probably knew him before.

95
00:09:56,021 --> 00:09:57,773
What does that mean?

96
00:09:57,898 --> 00:10:00,943
It means that Mr Bernard
is a very mysterious man.

97
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:04,780
What? He seemed perfectly normal to me.

98
00:10:04,905 --> 00:10:06,908
Now, what do you
really know about him?

99
00:10:07,033 --> 00:10:10,286
What do I - I know his name.
We were sitting there, we were talking.

100
00:10:10,411 --> 00:10:15,041
You don't know anything about this man,
and he knows everything about you.

101
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:16,668
Oh, wait.

102
00:10:16,835 --> 00:10:18,837
He knows that you live
in Indianapolis, Indiana.

103
00:10:18,962 --> 00:10:21,381
He knows you're a doctor
at the Good Samaritan Hospital.

104
00:10:21,548 --> 00:10:25,219
He knows that you attended
a medical convention in Paris,

105
00:10:25,386 --> 00:10:28,347
and that you stopped off
in Rome, Lisbon and Casablanca.

106
00:10:28,514 --> 00:10:30,182
Alright.

107
00:10:30,308 --> 00:10:34,979
He knows that you served
in North Africa in an army field hospital.

108
00:10:35,104 --> 00:10:38,191
Honey, it was just a casual conversation,
that's all.

109
00:10:38,316 --> 00:10:40,402
Darling, you weren't just talking casually.

110
00:10:40,569 --> 00:10:43,363
He was asking all kinds of questions,
and you were answering them.

111
00:10:43,488 --> 00:10:45,657
You might as well have
handed him your passport.

112
00:10:45,782 --> 00:10:49,828
We just had a conversation.
I've got nothing to hide.

113
00:10:49,954 --> 00:10:54,125
But I have a feeling that Mr Bernard has.

114
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,335
I know this is mysterious Morocco,

115
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:59,255
but we're not
gonna lose our head, are we?

116
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:02,217
- I know. I know what it is.
- What?

117
00:11:02,342 --> 00:11:05,887
You're sore because this fella
didn't ask you any questions.

118
00:11:06,054 --> 00:11:08,598
- Oh, hardy-har-har.
- Hardy-har.

119
00:11:51,102 --> 00:11:54,314
- Well, this eases the pain.
- What pain, Mommy?

120
00:11:54,439 --> 00:11:56,942
- It's just an expression.
- Hey, can you take care of the driver?

121
00:11:57,067 --> 00:11:59,903
- My name is Dr McKenna.
- I'll take care of everything.

122
00:12:05,993 --> 00:12:07,953
- Come on.
- We're being watched.

123
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,039
What? Oh, come on!

124
00:12:25,264 --> 00:12:29,059
# Que sera, sera

125
00:12:29,184 --> 00:12:32,438
# What will be will be

126
00:12:32,563 --> 00:12:36,734
# When I was just a little boy

127
00:12:36,901 --> 00:12:39,070
# I asked my mother

128
00:12:39,195 --> 00:12:41,239
What will I be

129
00:12:41,364 --> 00:12:45,869
- He'll make a fine doctor.
- # Will I be handsome

130
00:12:46,036 --> 00:12:48,372
# Will I be rich

131
00:12:48,538 --> 00:12:52,167
- # Here's what she said to me
- Come on, darling.

132
00:12:52,292 --> 00:12:56,338
# Que sera, sera

133
00:12:56,505 --> 00:13:00,718
# Whatever will be will be

134
00:13:00,885 --> 00:13:04,722
# The future's not ours to see

135
00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:09,227
# Que sera, sera

136
00:13:09,394 --> 00:13:12,564
# What will be will be.

137
00:13:12,731 --> 00:13:14,399
Second verse.

138
00:13:14,524 --> 00:13:18,904
# When I was just a child in school

139
00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:21,407
# I asked my teacher

140
00:13:21,532 --> 00:13:23,451
# What should I try

141
00:13:23,576 --> 00:13:25,286
Catch.

142
00:13:25,411 --> 00:13:27,413
# Should I paint pictures

143
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,749
# Should I sing songs

144
00:13:29,874 --> 00:13:33,461
# This was her wise reply

145
00:13:33,586 --> 00:13:37,549
# Que sera, sera

146
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:41,970
# Whatever will be will be

147
00:13:42,137 --> 00:13:46,142
# The future's not ours to see

148
00:13:46,267 --> 00:13:48,602
# Que sera, sera.

149
00:13:48,769 --> 00:13:50,605
Oops.

150
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:53,566
# What will be will be

151
00:13:53,691 --> 00:13:55,527
May I have this next dance?

152
00:13:55,652 --> 00:13:57,487
- Yes.
- Alright.

153
00:13:57,612 --> 00:14:01,533
# Dum, dee, dum-da-dum

154
00:14:01,658 --> 00:14:03,493
# Da-da-da-da #º

155
00:14:03,619 --> 00:14:05,621
Oh, you're divine.

156
00:14:11,502 --> 00:14:14,714
- Dinner for the boy.
- Yeah, come in.

157
00:14:18,635 --> 00:14:21,262
I can't tell you how beautifully
your wife sings.

158
00:14:21,387 --> 00:14:24,140
- Pretty good, isn't she?
- Oh, she's marvellous.

159
00:14:24,266 --> 00:14:26,268
Too bad it was interrupted.

160
00:14:26,393 --> 00:14:28,854
I've had that same feeling
myself many times.

161
00:14:29,021 --> 00:14:31,315
Well, everything's fine.
The manager has a babysitter for us.

162
00:14:31,482 --> 00:14:33,150
Good.

163
00:14:33,275 --> 00:14:35,361
Permit me the pleasure of
serving you a drink.

164
00:14:35,486 --> 00:14:37,488
I would love it. Thank you.

165
00:14:37,655 --> 00:14:39,699
Were you on the American stage,
Mrs McKenna?

166
00:14:43,953 --> 00:14:46,247
Yes, Mr Bernard,
I was on the American stage

167
00:14:46,372 --> 00:14:48,375
and the London stage
and the Paris stage.

168
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,168
Oh?

169
00:14:50,293 --> 00:14:52,462
I thought perhaps you had
seen me in Paris, being French.

170
00:14:52,587 --> 00:14:55,716
The theatre requires time,

171
00:14:55,841 --> 00:14:58,177
and for me time is often a luxury.

172
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,889
Have you ever been to Paris, Mr Bernard?

173
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:04,767
I was born there.

174
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,812
Oh.

175
00:15:12,776 --> 00:15:17,698
- What business are you in?
- I buy... and sell.

176
00:15:18,615 --> 00:15:21,452
- What?
- Whatever gives the best profit.

177
00:15:25,706 --> 00:15:28,459
Now that you're in Marrakech,
what are you buying and selling?

178
00:15:28,584 --> 00:15:32,880
You know, I would much rather
talk about the stage.

179
00:15:33,047 --> 00:15:35,175
If you tell me what shows you are in -

180
00:15:35,341 --> 00:15:39,429
Would you excuse me? I'll get it.

181
00:15:39,554 --> 00:15:41,556
- No, I'll get it.
- No, I will.

182
00:15:59,742 --> 00:16:02,120
I'm inquiring for the room
of Mr Montgomery.

183
00:16:02,287 --> 00:16:04,372
He asked me for a drink, and I -

184
00:16:04,498 --> 00:16:06,541
I'm sorry. There's no Montgomery here.

185
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:09,044
Pardon me, monsieur.
I regret disturbing you.

186
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:10,838
OK.

187
00:16:21,224 --> 00:16:23,142
- May I use your telephone, please?
- Sure.

188
00:16:23,309 --> 00:16:25,270
- Mommy!
- Yes?

189
00:16:25,437 --> 00:16:28,523
- I can't cut this meat.
- I'll do it for you.

190
00:16:34,488 --> 00:16:36,323
Merci.

191
00:16:37,157 --> 00:16:38,993
Allô?

192
00:16:46,459 --> 00:16:48,294
D'accord.

193
00:16:53,258 --> 00:16:56,219
I'm terribly sorry, but I cannot go
to dinner with you tonight.

194
00:16:56,345 --> 00:16:58,889
- Oh?
- I have neglected an important matter

195
00:16:59,014 --> 00:17:01,850
- which now requires my attention.
- Oh, I see.

196
00:17:01,976 --> 00:17:06,230
- Perhaps another night?
- Oh, sure, sure.

197
00:17:06,355 --> 00:17:08,357
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

198
00:17:10,193 --> 00:17:12,153
- Bye.
- Good night.

199
00:17:13,404 --> 00:17:15,407
Good night.

200
00:17:30,965 --> 00:17:33,467
- Bonsoir, madame, monsieur.
- My name's McKenna.

201
00:17:33,593 --> 00:17:36,763
Of course. The hotel phoned.
Follow me, please.

202
00:17:39,432 --> 00:17:42,936
- I'm certain you'll find this comfortable.
- Thank you.

203
00:18:15,721 --> 00:18:17,806
Honey, move over here.

204
00:18:26,733 --> 00:18:28,776
You're on my dress.

205
00:18:42,499 --> 00:18:44,335
Whoop.

206
00:18:55,764 --> 00:18:59,309
Yeah.

207
00:18:59,476 --> 00:19:01,603
We always wash
the hands before eating.

208
00:19:10,029 --> 00:19:12,031
Thank you.

209
00:19:21,917 --> 00:19:24,127
- Those people are staring at us.
- What people?

210
00:19:24,294 --> 00:19:26,254
- Right in back of us.
- What?

211
00:19:26,421 --> 00:19:28,382
- Yes.
- Here.

212
00:19:28,507 --> 00:19:30,509
They were staring at us
in front of the hotel too.

213
00:19:30,634 --> 00:19:32,887
Jo, will you please stop imagining things.

214
00:19:33,012 --> 00:19:34,805
I'm not.

215
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:37,683
Good evening.
You must think me awfully rude.

216
00:19:37,808 --> 00:19:40,353
I've been staring at you
since I saw you at the hotel.

217
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:45,191
- You are Jo Conway, the Jo Conway?
- Yes, I am.

218
00:19:45,316 --> 00:19:49,321
I knew I was right.
I'm Lucy Drayton, and this is my husband.

219
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:52,282
- How do you do?
- We're Dr and Mrs McKenna.

220
00:19:52,407 --> 00:19:55,744
My wife tells me Mrs McKenna
appeared at the London Palladium.

221
00:19:55,869 --> 00:19:57,705
We hardly ever see a show now.

222
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,832
Edward is such an old stick-in-the-mud

223
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:02,335
so I have to
console myself with your records.

224
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:07,465
I must admit I love 'em.
I'm not one for this terrible be-bop.

225
00:20:07,632 --> 00:20:10,468
- Thank you very much.
- When are you coming back to London?

226
00:20:10,593 --> 00:20:12,929
- Possibly never again, professionally.
- Oh.

227
00:20:13,054 --> 00:20:15,724
- Don't say you're giving up the stage.
- Well, temporarily I am.

228
00:20:15,849 --> 00:20:19,311
It's just that I'm a doctor,
and a doctor's wife never has much time.

229
00:20:19,436 --> 00:20:21,772
What my husband is trying to
say is Broadway musical shows

230
00:20:21,897 --> 00:20:24,066
are not produced in Indianapolis, Indiana.

231
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:28,488
We could live in New York. I hear
that doctors aren't starving there either.

232
00:20:28,613 --> 00:20:31,616
It's not that I have any objection
to working in New York.

233
00:20:31,741 --> 00:20:35,620
It's just that it'd be hard for my patients
to come from Indianapolis for treatment.

234
00:20:35,745 --> 00:20:38,039
I'm always
saying the wrong thing. I'm sorry.

235
00:20:38,165 --> 00:20:40,042
Not in the least.

236
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:42,169
Dr McKenna, do you -

237
00:20:42,336 --> 00:20:46,757
Why don't all of you sort of
turn around here, or something.

238
00:20:46,882 --> 00:20:49,218
It's kind of - kind of hard on the neck.

239
00:20:49,927 --> 00:20:51,929
It's in one of our English counties.

240
00:20:52,054 --> 00:20:55,099
It's not what you'd call a farm.
It's more of a smallholding.

241
00:20:55,224 --> 00:20:57,393
Here we are.

242
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,396
- Oh.
- Isn't that fascinating?

243
00:20:59,521 --> 00:21:01,106
Yes.

244
00:21:01,231 --> 00:21:03,567
- There we are.
- Uhh.

245
00:21:06,403 --> 00:21:08,405
- Hey, they look good.
- Surprise.

246
00:21:08,572 --> 00:21:10,532
Oh, they look wonderful.

247
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:13,452
Ah, looks like bread.

248
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:17,123
- We're not going to eat all that, are we?
- No.

249
00:21:17,248 --> 00:21:19,542
Is that the way you do it?

250
00:21:19,667 --> 00:21:22,504
Yes, just break it, just like this.

251
00:21:23,379 --> 00:21:25,757
It won't break. Oh, no.

252
00:21:25,882 --> 00:21:28,593
Well, I'm gonna - There.

253
00:21:28,718 --> 00:21:32,097
- Is that the way you do it?
- That's quite alright.

254
00:21:32,222 --> 00:21:34,808
That was a tough one.

255
00:21:34,933 --> 00:21:37,561
Does it chew any better than it tears?

256
00:21:39,397 --> 00:21:43,276
- Is it fattening?
- I imagine it must be.

257
00:21:43,443 --> 00:21:45,403
No, it's pretty good, hon.

258
00:21:46,237 --> 00:21:47,739
- Well, I -
- No plate.

259
00:21:47,864 --> 00:21:49,866
- No?
- No. No knives and forks either.

260
00:21:49,991 --> 00:21:51,993
I understand you're supposed to dig in.

261
00:21:52,118 --> 00:21:54,454
Oh, allow me to show you, will you?

262
00:21:54,621 --> 00:21:57,583
You use only the first two fingers
and thumb of the right hand.

263
00:21:57,708 --> 00:22:00,878
You don't use the other two fingers,
and always the left hand in the lap.

264
00:22:01,003 --> 00:22:03,672
- Oh, I see.
- May I show you?

265
00:22:03,798 --> 00:22:07,301
- Ju-Just these two fingers, huh?
- I'll hold it for you.

266
00:22:16,311 --> 00:22:18,480
- See.
- There we are.

267
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:22,192
Well, I, uh... uh...

268
00:22:22,317 --> 00:22:24,737
Boy, could I use this hand.

269
00:22:24,862 --> 00:22:28,324
- I can't, uh...
- It's alright.

270
00:22:28,491 --> 00:22:30,993
- It's good stuff.
- No one minds.

271
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:34,497
- It's messy, but worth it.
- I'll practise on an olive.

272
00:22:34,622 --> 00:22:37,459
Oh, honey, it's wonderful.
Here. Take a bite.

273
00:22:37,584 --> 00:22:39,586
- Good?
- Yeah.

274
00:22:39,711 --> 00:22:42,506
Tell me - does this way of eating
have to do with religion, or something?

275
00:22:42,672 --> 00:22:44,800
I think it's more social than religious.

276
00:22:44,967 --> 00:22:46,844
I don't know.

277
00:22:46,969 --> 00:22:49,430
It seems like if you have
four good fingers and a thumb

278
00:22:49,555 --> 00:22:51,765
you oughta be able to use all of 'em.

279
00:22:51,891 --> 00:22:53,893
- It's very good.
- Very good.

280
00:22:54,685 --> 00:22:56,646
Well, as I was saying,

281
00:22:56,812 --> 00:22:59,816
I was quite happy farming my bit of land

282
00:22:59,941 --> 00:23:02,861
when these United Nations fellows
started worrying me.

283
00:23:03,027 --> 00:23:05,697
Edward was a big noise
in the Ministry of Food during the war.

284
00:23:05,864 --> 00:23:09,576
So we pulled ourselves up at the roots,
and here we are, United Nations Relief.

285
00:23:10,243 --> 00:23:12,246
Sounds like interesting work.

286
00:23:12,371 --> 00:23:15,791
I'm preparing a report
on soil erosion at the moment.

287
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:19,211
Parts of this country are not unlike
your dustbowl formation.

288
00:23:19,378 --> 00:23:21,339
A thin layer of topsoil,

289
00:23:21,506 --> 00:23:23,216
and underneath, so...

290
00:23:31,224 --> 00:23:34,269
How do you like that?
First he promises to take us to dinner -

291
00:23:34,394 --> 00:23:37,898
Yeah.
Well, we just met him today, honey.

292
00:23:38,065 --> 00:23:40,401
You can't expect him
to change his whole life.

293
00:23:40,568 --> 00:23:42,528
Ben, what's the matter with you?

294
00:23:42,695 --> 00:23:44,947
Nothing. What's the matter with you?

295
00:23:45,072 --> 00:23:47,492
I just don't want to be insulted.

296
00:23:47,617 --> 00:23:49,577
Oh, you're not being insulted.

297
00:23:49,702 --> 00:23:53,873
You can't blame him for turning
down an old married couple like us.

298
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:57,419
- We're not an old married couple!
- Alright.

299
00:23:57,586 --> 00:23:59,087
Alright, he's a heel.

300
00:23:59,254 --> 00:24:00,881
I don't understand him,

301
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:03,008
but I'm beginning not to like
what he's doing to our whole night.

302
00:24:03,133 --> 00:24:05,135
I must do some
shopping in the market tomorrow.

303
00:24:05,261 --> 00:24:06,804
I do hope it will be fine.

304
00:24:07,596 --> 00:24:09,557
Well, not too fine.

305
00:24:09,724 --> 00:24:12,810
I know our English weather
is pretty awful, but sometimes,

306
00:24:12,935 --> 00:24:14,938
we don't realise when we're lucky.

307
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:19,943
All this sunshine day after day,
well, it doesn't seem natural somehow.

308
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:22,195
- I want to get up.
- Ben, don't.

309
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,366
I know you. Once you get
worked up, you start a fight.

310
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:29,078
Will you come to the market
with us tomorrow?

311
00:24:29,244 --> 00:24:32,081
As a matter of fact, Louis Bernard,
the big buyer from Paris,

312
00:24:32,206 --> 00:24:34,583
was going to take us
to the marketplace tomorrow.

313
00:24:34,709 --> 00:24:39,464
- Yeah. I think I'll cancel out.
- Sit down and eat your dinner.

314
00:24:39,631 --> 00:24:42,467
- We - We'd love to go.
- Oh, we'd be delighted.

315
00:24:43,134 --> 00:24:46,805
I don't know why he gets so worked up
over unimportant things.

316
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:54,980
Non, Monsieur! Monsieur.

317
00:25:17,379 --> 00:25:20,090
# Ho! Ho! Ho!

318
00:25:20,216 --> 00:25:22,510
# Ho, ho, ho, ho!

319
00:25:57,756 --> 00:25:59,549
What's he saying, Mrs Drayton?

320
00:25:59,674 --> 00:26:01,384
He's the teller of tales, Hank.

321
00:26:04,846 --> 00:26:06,849
Isn't this exciting?

322
00:26:06,974 --> 00:26:08,976
Just like the county fair
when I was a kid.

323
00:26:09,101 --> 00:26:11,854
They got everything
but the balloon ascension.

324
00:26:14,273 --> 00:26:17,235
What's so funny?
Did you ever see a balloon ascension?

325
00:26:17,402 --> 00:26:20,572
I was thinking. You know what's paying
for these three days in Marrakech?

326
00:26:20,738 --> 00:26:22,824
- Me.
- Mrs Campbell's gallstones.

327
00:26:22,949 --> 00:26:24,784
Oh.

328
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:26,912
- You know the purse I bought in Paris?
- Yeah.

329
00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:29,039
Bill Edward's tonsils.

330
00:26:29,206 --> 00:26:30,916
Mommy! Daddy!

331
00:26:31,083 --> 00:26:35,045
Daddy, come with us!
We're gonna see the medicine man.

332
00:26:35,212 --> 00:26:38,174
- Maybe you can learn something, Daddy.
- I wouldn't be surprised.

333
00:26:38,299 --> 00:26:40,301
Anytime he starts wearing you out -

334
00:26:40,426 --> 00:26:43,096
I haven't enjoyed the market so much.

335
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:47,392
- I never thought of it that way before.
- What?

336
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:50,562
I'm wearing
Johnny Matthews's appendix.

337
00:26:50,729 --> 00:26:52,731
What about the boat trip?

338
00:26:52,856 --> 00:26:55,734
It took two boys, one girl,
and two sets of twins, didn't it?

339
00:26:55,859 --> 00:26:58,862
And Mrs Morgan's hives.

340
00:27:05,328 --> 00:27:07,622
- How are the acrobats today?
- Wonderful.

341
00:27:07,747 --> 00:27:10,083
Watch that kid that goes
clear to the top there.

342
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:12,585
- I'll see you later.
- Yes.

343
00:27:15,422 --> 00:27:18,800
All the way home we'll be riding on
Herbie Taylor's ulcers.

344
00:27:18,967 --> 00:27:21,303
And Allida Markle's asthma.

345
00:27:21,428 --> 00:27:24,974
Now if we could just get four cases
of seven-year-itch we could retire.

346
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,268
Or if Mrs Yarrow's really
gonna have triplets,

347
00:27:27,435 --> 00:27:30,188
we could completely
redecorate the house.

348
00:27:30,313 --> 00:27:32,482
What would they say if they heard us?

349
00:27:32,649 --> 00:27:34,943
One of the reasons
I came to a place like Marrakech

350
00:27:35,068 --> 00:27:38,488
is so we could say things like that
without everybody hearing us.

351
00:27:40,657 --> 00:27:43,285
I'd like to say something
where nobody could hear us.

352
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:45,412
This is the safest place.

353
00:27:45,537 --> 00:27:48,207
When are we
going to have another baby?

354
00:27:49,208 --> 00:27:51,460
You're the doctor.
You have all the answers.

355
00:27:51,585 --> 00:27:54,505
Yeah, but this is the first time
I've ever heard the question.

356
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:56,799
Mommy, look! Come here!

357
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:04,933
Look. Sewing machines.
Looks like a television commercial.

358
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:08,270
- Having a good time, Hank?
- I guess so.

359
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:10,230
He's delighted with everything.

360
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:20,992
Hank! Hank, come back here!

361
00:28:21,117 --> 00:28:23,036
- Hank!
- Hank!

362
00:28:23,995 --> 00:28:26,498
- It's best to keep out of trouble, Hank.
- What's going on?

363
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,376
Looks like the police
are chasing somebody.

364
00:29:04,371 --> 00:29:05,873
Aaah!

365
00:29:30,024 --> 00:29:32,777
Hey. Hey, look there.

366
00:29:35,822 --> 00:29:37,824
You better stand back.
Go on. Stand back.

367
00:29:53,966 --> 00:29:55,801
Monsieur McKenna.

368
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:00,515
I'm Louis Bernard.

369
00:30:06,813 --> 00:30:10,650
A man, a statesman,

370
00:30:10,776 --> 00:30:13,278
he is to be killed,

371
00:30:13,403 --> 00:30:15,572
assassinated,

372
00:30:15,697 --> 00:30:17,866
in London

373
00:30:17,992 --> 00:30:20,995
soon, very soon.

374
00:30:22,705 --> 00:30:26,042
Tell them in London

375
00:30:28,211 --> 00:30:31,047
Ambrose Chappell.

376
00:30:32,632 --> 00:30:34,634
Chappell.

377
00:31:01,246 --> 00:31:03,248
- Ben, who is he?
- Louis Bernard.

378
00:31:03,373 --> 00:31:05,417
- You got something to write on?
- Louis Bernard!

379
00:31:05,542 --> 00:31:07,544
He's dead.

380
00:31:33,906 --> 00:31:36,033
He says, "Do you know this man?"

381
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,287
Yes, we do know him.
He's Louis Bernard, the French...

382
00:31:39,412 --> 00:31:42,582
Louis Bernard?

383
00:31:42,749 --> 00:31:44,876
Monsieur and Madame McKenna.

384
00:31:48,588 --> 00:31:51,174
He wants you to go to
police headquarters to make a statement.

385
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:54,636
- OK.
- Our friends have to go to the station.

386
00:31:54,762 --> 00:31:56,639
- I'd better go with them.
- Yes, of course.

387
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:06,983
You don't want your
little boy to go, do you?

388
00:32:07,108 --> 00:32:10,028
But I want to go to the police station.

389
00:32:10,153 --> 00:32:12,489
I think it's better
if I take him back to the hotel.

390
00:32:12,614 --> 00:32:14,616
- Would you, please.
- Certainly.

391
00:32:14,783 --> 00:32:16,910
Thank you. Be good, Hank.

392
00:32:17,077 --> 00:32:20,622
We're to be going.

393
00:32:20,789 --> 00:32:23,042
Heaven knows when we shall be back.

394
00:32:28,631 --> 00:32:32,343
Why do you suppose he turned up
in an Arab outfit and wearing make-up?

395
00:32:32,468 --> 00:32:34,596
What's more important:
why was he killed?

396
00:32:34,763 --> 00:32:36,765
I bet he was a spy or something.

397
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:39,017
What were you writing down?
What was he telling you?

398
00:32:39,142 --> 00:32:41,019
I'll tell you later.

399
00:32:41,144 --> 00:32:43,814
What is it?

400
00:32:43,981 --> 00:32:47,484
I-I just feel kinda funny.

401
00:32:47,651 --> 00:32:50,696
Why should he pick me out to tell?

402
00:32:50,821 --> 00:32:53,783
After what we said about him last night.

403
00:33:06,713 --> 00:33:10,134
When we get in with the inspector,
I'll do my best to cut the red tape.

404
00:33:10,259 --> 00:33:14,889
- Fine. Fine.
- I'm going to stretch a bit.

405
00:33:15,014 --> 00:33:19,268
I'm afraid the questions will go till
doomsday if you admit you knew him.

406
00:33:19,394 --> 00:33:21,896
I don't know him at all.
We met yesterday on a bus.

407
00:33:22,021 --> 00:33:26,359
They're a cynical lot, these French.
They might refuse to believe that.

408
00:33:26,526 --> 00:33:29,321
Well, they've got to believe it.

409
00:33:29,446 --> 00:33:31,448
Look at it from their point of view.

410
00:33:31,573 --> 00:33:33,867
They saw this poor fellow
whispering to you,

411
00:33:33,992 --> 00:33:36,287
and then they saw you
write something down.

412
00:33:36,412 --> 00:33:38,914
Are you gonna show them
what you wrote?

413
00:33:58,769 --> 00:34:02,356
Thank you, Mr Drayton,
but a translator will not be necessary.

414
00:34:02,481 --> 00:34:05,151
Won't you come inside,
madame, monsieur?

415
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:11,157
Do me the kindness to wait.
I might have questions for you later.

416
00:34:22,753 --> 00:34:24,755
Passports, please.

417
00:34:39,396 --> 00:34:41,565
You came to French Morocco
four days ago?

418
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:43,692
That's right.

419
00:34:43,817 --> 00:34:45,944
You are a doctor, sir?

420
00:34:46,111 --> 00:34:50,741
Yes, I'm a surgeon,
a tourist and American citizen.

421
00:34:50,908 --> 00:34:53,911
Three good reasons why you should have
nothing in common with Louis Bernard.

422
00:34:54,036 --> 00:34:56,455
I didn't have.

423
00:34:56,622 --> 00:34:58,583
You were in Paris recently?

424
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:00,919
Yes, I was attending
a medical convention.

425
00:35:01,044 --> 00:35:03,296
You came to Marrakech in the same bus.

426
00:35:03,463 --> 00:35:05,298
You had an aperitif with him
in your hotel room.

427
00:35:05,423 --> 00:35:07,175
You ate at the same restaurant last night.

428
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,302
Yes, but at different tables.

429
00:35:14,266 --> 00:35:16,352
So Louis Bernard is a stranger to you?

430
00:35:16,477 --> 00:35:19,939
I met him for the first time
yesterday on a bus.

431
00:35:21,232 --> 00:35:23,985
And yet, out of 5,000 people

432
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:25,945
in a great marketplace,

433
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:28,073
he comes to you
when he is about to die.

434
00:35:29,574 --> 00:35:32,744
Is that the action
of a casual acquaintance?

435
00:35:32,869 --> 00:35:35,497
I know absolutely nothing
about Louis Bernard.

436
00:35:35,664 --> 00:35:39,376
Not even, I suppose, that he was
an agent of the Deuxieme Bureau.

437
00:35:39,835 --> 00:35:41,837
The - What's that?

438
00:35:43,214 --> 00:35:46,175
Perhaps you have also
never heard of the American FBI?

439
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,802
Now, wait. I -

440
00:35:47,927 --> 00:35:49,679
It would be so much easier
for both of us

441
00:35:49,804 --> 00:35:51,347
if you would cease to pretend.

442
00:35:51,514 --> 00:35:52,974
Look here -

443
00:35:53,141 --> 00:35:56,019
The dead man found out what
he had been sent here to discover.

444
00:35:56,186 --> 00:35:57,687
That's why he was killed.

445
00:35:57,854 --> 00:36:00,774
He told you what he had discovered.

446
00:36:01,525 --> 00:36:06,655
Why? Because he placed
complete confidence in you.

447
00:36:06,822 --> 00:36:09,867
You not only ask the questions,
you answer 'em too, don't you?

448
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:12,495
Let me ask you a question.

449
00:36:12,662 --> 00:36:16,875
Assuming that Bernard trusted me
as implicitly as you say,

450
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:19,544
then I'd never reveal
anything he said to me.

451
00:36:20,462 --> 00:36:22,464
Even Americans, I suppose,

452
00:36:22,589 --> 00:36:27,094
find it sometimes desirable
to betray a confidence.

453
00:36:27,219 --> 00:36:29,388
Let's get some things straight here.

454
00:36:29,555 --> 00:36:31,807
I'm a tourist. I'm travelling for pleasure.

455
00:36:31,932 --> 00:36:34,185
I somehow got involved in this
very unfortunate incident,

456
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:36,312
and I came here to make
a simple statement of fact

457
00:36:36,437 --> 00:36:38,439
and not be subjected to a police grilling.

458
00:36:38,564 --> 00:36:40,567
- I would like you -
- No, you let me finish.

459
00:36:40,733 --> 00:36:42,902
Entrez.

460
00:36:45,947 --> 00:36:48,283
Wait a minute. Did he say
I was wanted on the telephone?

461
00:36:48,408 --> 00:36:50,410
I'll take that call now.

462
00:36:50,577 --> 00:36:52,830
- But, sir -
- You just take it easy.

463
00:37:04,133 --> 00:37:06,094
- Hello.
- Dr McKenna?

464
00:37:06,261 --> 00:37:08,096
This is Dr McKenna. Who's this?

465
00:37:08,263 --> 00:37:10,473
If you tell even one word

466
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:14,436
of what Louis Bernard whispered to you

467
00:37:14,561 --> 00:37:17,022
your little boy will be in serious danger.

468
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:20,943
Remember, say nothing.

469
00:37:25,907 --> 00:37:27,909
Hello?

470
00:37:35,166 --> 00:37:36,835
Drayton?

471
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:43,217
Didn't you tell me your wife was going
to take Hank back to the hotel?

472
00:37:43,342 --> 00:37:45,511
- I thought so, yes.
- Call her up.

473
00:37:45,636 --> 00:37:47,763
Somebody just called me,
threatened me about Hank.

474
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:49,932
Call her up, see if he's alright.

475
00:38:00,151 --> 00:38:02,487
Hotel Mamounia?

476
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:17,253
Bien. Merci.

477
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:21,216
My wife doesn't answer.

478
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:28,598
Concierge?

479
00:38:40,862 --> 00:38:43,990
Oh. Bien. Merci.

480
00:38:45,158 --> 00:38:47,327
Oh, ye - Uh...

481
00:38:47,452 --> 00:38:50,372
What's your room number?

482
00:38:50,497 --> 00:38:52,499
414.

483
00:39:04,595 --> 00:39:06,264
Bien. Merci.

484
00:39:06,389 --> 00:39:08,016
I can't believe it.

485
00:39:08,891 --> 00:39:12,562
- She hasn't come back yet, huh?
- At least, nobody's seen her.

486
00:39:14,856 --> 00:39:17,567
Alright, now you go back to the hotel.

487
00:39:17,693 --> 00:39:22,072
You - And...
see if you can find out what's going on.

488
00:39:22,197 --> 00:39:24,116
It's so unlike my wife.

489
00:39:24,241 --> 00:39:27,036
I'll take care of the police
and join you as soon as I can.

490
00:39:27,161 --> 00:39:28,829
Look here. Don't worry.

491
00:39:28,955 --> 00:39:31,416
It's probably some
stupid misunderstanding.

492
00:39:31,541 --> 00:39:34,794
If I find anything out before you get back,
I'll telephone you here.

493
00:39:34,919 --> 00:39:37,255
- Don't waste any time.
- Goodbye.

494
00:39:44,096 --> 00:39:45,931
Who was it, Ben?

495
00:39:47,099 --> 00:39:49,268
It was the, uh...

496
00:39:49,435 --> 00:39:53,189
the, uh... concierge at the hotel.

497
00:39:53,689 --> 00:39:55,858
He found out we were
being held by the police.

498
00:39:55,983 --> 00:39:58,528
He just called to see
if there was anything he could do.

499
00:39:58,653 --> 00:40:02,073
- That's very nice of him.
- Yes, I thought so.

500
00:40:02,198 --> 00:40:04,618
I told him if we weren't
back there in 15 minutes,

501
00:40:04,784 --> 00:40:08,246
for him to call the American Consulate
at Casablanca.

502
00:40:10,457 --> 00:40:13,752
But, monsieur,
if you had only told me in the first place

503
00:40:13,877 --> 00:40:15,880
that you wished
to consult with your consul.

504
00:40:16,005 --> 00:40:18,007
Yeah, yeah. Come on, Jo.

505
00:40:18,132 --> 00:40:20,384
There is just one small formality.

506
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:23,012
I must request you to sign a statement.

507
00:40:23,137 --> 00:40:25,306
If it doesn't take too long, of course.

508
00:40:25,473 --> 00:40:28,435
Wait a moment. I will send for a typist.

509
00:40:35,984 --> 00:40:37,945
Ben?

510
00:40:38,112 --> 00:40:40,030
Yeah?

511
00:40:40,156 --> 00:40:43,200
Aren't you going to
let me see the message?

512
00:40:43,326 --> 00:40:45,661
I don't - I...

513
00:40:46,871 --> 00:40:49,207
I don't think I should.

514
00:40:49,332 --> 00:40:51,334
Darling, I'm not the police inspector.

515
00:40:51,501 --> 00:40:53,962
I think that I should see it.

516
00:41:05,349 --> 00:41:07,351
Ben, why didn't you
give this to the police?

517
00:41:07,518 --> 00:41:09,478
- Because I didn't want to.
- But, Ben, a man's life -

518
00:41:09,645 --> 00:41:11,647
Is at stake, yeah I know.

519
00:41:11,773 --> 00:41:14,567
I just - I-I don't know
what's the right thing to do.

520
00:41:18,863 --> 00:41:22,784
We should go back to the hotel,
pick up Hank and get out of here.

521
00:41:22,909 --> 00:41:24,912
- Maybe.
- Think about Hank.

522
00:41:25,037 --> 00:41:27,289
What a terrible thing this is for him,

523
00:41:27,414 --> 00:41:29,500
seeing a man murdered
right before his eyes.

524
00:41:29,667 --> 00:41:32,628
- It's a horrible shock to a little boy.
- I know.

525
00:41:32,753 --> 00:41:35,423
Why don't you take that note,
give it to the American Consulate,

526
00:41:35,548 --> 00:41:38,092
and let's not
get any more involved, please.

527
00:41:51,565 --> 00:41:53,692
Why don't you get the key?
I'll take care of the driver.

528
00:41:53,817 --> 00:41:55,361
Alright.

529
00:42:02,577 --> 00:42:05,079
Say, uh... you know a Mrs Drayton?

530
00:42:05,246 --> 00:42:07,207
- English lady.
- That's right.

531
00:42:07,374 --> 00:42:11,211
Did you see her coming
from the marketplace in the last hour?

532
00:42:11,336 --> 00:42:15,090
- No, sir.
- Wait a minute. This is very important.

533
00:42:15,215 --> 00:42:19,637
- She had my little boy with her.
- No, sir.

534
00:42:19,762 --> 00:42:23,266
- What about Mr Drayton?
- Mr Drayton checked out.

535
00:42:24,767 --> 00:42:26,686
- He what?
- Checked out.

536
00:42:26,811 --> 00:42:28,771
- But he couldn't have.
- Yes, sir, he did.

537
00:42:28,897 --> 00:42:31,816
Mr Drayton, the Englishman
with the horn-rimmed glasses.

538
00:42:31,941 --> 00:42:33,944
Yes, sir. He checked out.

539
00:42:40,951 --> 00:42:44,413
I don't know about you,
but I'm exhausted.

540
00:42:46,999 --> 00:42:49,585
I'll call Mrs Drayton,
tell her she can bring Hank back.

541
00:42:49,752 --> 00:42:52,171
- Just hold that call a minute, Jo.
- Why?

542
00:42:52,297 --> 00:42:54,299
Because I asked you to!

543
00:42:55,592 --> 00:42:59,638
Ben, are we about to have
our monthly fight?

544
00:43:01,473 --> 00:43:03,308
I hope not.

545
00:43:03,475 --> 00:43:05,811
Well, then stop acting like that.

546
00:43:06,812 --> 00:43:09,315
I merely said
I was going to call Mrs Drayton.

547
00:43:09,482 --> 00:43:11,567
Just a minute.

548
00:43:11,692 --> 00:43:13,361
Wait a minute.

549
00:43:13,486 --> 00:43:15,822
Just a minute. Just a minute.

550
00:43:15,988 --> 00:43:18,449
I want you to take these.
They'll relax you.

551
00:43:18,616 --> 00:43:22,704
Relax me? I'm so relaxed I'm tired.

552
00:43:22,787 --> 00:43:25,290
- Maybe you need them.
- These are for you, Jo.

553
00:43:25,415 --> 00:43:28,544
- I'm the doctor. Here.
- Ben -

554
00:43:28,669 --> 00:43:31,672
You know what happens
when you get excited and nervous.

555
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:33,799
Here. Do me a favour.

556
00:43:33,966 --> 00:43:36,510
Six months ago you told me
I took too many pills.

557
00:43:36,677 --> 00:43:39,180
Six months ago you weren't
a witness to a murder.

558
00:43:39,347 --> 00:43:42,016
You've been excited.
You've been talking a blue streak.

559
00:43:42,183 --> 00:43:44,853
- You've been walking around in circles.
- I haven't!

560
00:43:45,019 --> 00:43:49,566
Jo, I make my living knowing
when and how to administer medicine.

561
00:43:49,691 --> 00:43:52,277
You'll feel better if you take these.

562
00:43:52,402 --> 00:43:55,864
You don't think you will -
I'll make a deal with you.

563
00:43:55,990 --> 00:43:57,992
We'll make a deal. What is this?

564
00:43:58,158 --> 00:44:00,828
There's something about
this Louis Bernard, the police station

565
00:44:00,953 --> 00:44:03,206
and this whole spy business
I haven't told you yet.

566
00:44:03,706 --> 00:44:05,875
- What?
- Here's the price of curiosity.

567
00:44:06,042 --> 00:44:08,169
- What is it?
- There's one way of finding out.

568
00:44:13,258 --> 00:44:17,429
Alright, Dr McKenna.
I'm now relaxed and listening.

569
00:44:19,223 --> 00:44:22,852
There's been something strange about
this whole thing from the very beginning.

570
00:44:22,977 --> 00:44:27,648
It wasn't any accident Louis Bernard
came up to us, helped us on the bus

571
00:44:27,773 --> 00:44:29,776
and started up a conversation.

572
00:44:29,901 --> 00:44:32,528
- You were right about him.
- You see there?

573
00:44:32,695 --> 00:44:34,697
I know. I know. That's what I said.

574
00:44:34,823 --> 00:44:36,992
You were right. He was strange.

575
00:44:37,117 --> 00:44:40,912
Yes, I know all that.
But what were you going to tell me?

576
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:44,708
He started to talk to us,
and the reason he started

577
00:44:44,833 --> 00:44:48,254
was because he was on the lookout
for a suspicious married couple.

578
00:44:48,921 --> 00:44:51,549
There's nothing very suspicious-looking
about us, is there?

579
00:44:51,716 --> 00:44:55,470
No, because he was wrong.
It was a different married couple.

580
00:44:56,763 --> 00:44:59,307
Oh. And he was killed
before he found them?

581
00:44:59,432 --> 00:45:02,936
No, he found them.
He found them, all right.

582
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:05,605
It was in the restaurant
where we had dinner last night.

583
00:45:05,772 --> 00:45:07,733
That's one of the reasons
he was killed.

584
00:45:09,276 --> 00:45:11,904
You'll be telling me next
it's Mr and Mrs Drayton.

585
00:45:12,071 --> 00:45:13,531
That's who it was, Jo.

586
00:45:16,117 --> 00:45:19,245
Ben, if this is your idea of a joke,
it's not a very funny one.

587
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:25,919
- I think I'll lie down.
- Now, listen to me, Jo.

588
00:45:26,461 --> 00:45:28,296
Now, listen to me very carefully.

589
00:45:29,798 --> 00:45:34,636
That phone call at the police station,
that wasn't the concierge at the hotel.

590
00:45:35,429 --> 00:45:37,556
That was a man with a foreign voice.

591
00:45:37,681 --> 00:45:42,353
He told me if I mentioned one single word
of what Bernard told me in the market,

592
00:45:42,478 --> 00:45:44,480
that something
would happen to Hank.

593
00:45:44,647 --> 00:45:46,649
Hank? Why Hank?

594
00:45:46,816 --> 00:45:48,568
They've taken him away.

595
00:45:50,362 --> 00:45:53,532
But Mrs Drayton brought him
back to the hotel.

596
00:45:53,657 --> 00:45:56,577
Mrs Drayton never got back to the hotel
and neither did Hank.

597
00:45:56,702 --> 00:45:58,704
- But Mr Drayton -
- Listen, Jo.

598
00:45:58,829 --> 00:46:02,124
Mr Drayton checked out
of the hotel 40 minutes ago.

599
00:46:02,249 --> 00:46:04,251
Now, come on, Jo. Sit down.

600
00:46:04,377 --> 00:46:07,421
I could kill you!
You gave me sedatives!

601
00:46:07,547 --> 00:46:10,341
- Sit down.
- You did! Let go!

602
00:46:10,508 --> 00:46:13,178
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I wasn't sure.

603
00:46:13,344 --> 00:46:16,765
- You did! You did!
- Jo, please! Please!

604
00:46:16,890 --> 00:46:20,185
Let go of me! Let go!

605
00:46:20,352 --> 00:46:22,938
- Ben!
- Lie down, Jo.

606
00:46:23,063 --> 00:46:25,941
Oh, Ben, let me find my baby!

607
00:46:26,066 --> 00:46:28,360
Oh, dear God!

608
00:46:28,486 --> 00:46:31,989
- I want my boy!
- Jo, please.

609
00:46:32,156 --> 00:46:34,158
Ben, please. Oh, dear God!

610
00:46:34,283 --> 00:46:35,952
Where is he, Ben?

611
00:46:39,664 --> 00:46:41,666
Forgive me, Jo.

612
00:46:41,791 --> 00:46:43,794
Forgive me.

613
00:47:39,603 --> 00:47:41,564
There's still no word of him, Jo.

614
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:45,234
The Draytons are definitely gone.

615
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:48,070
The register in the hotel
says they came from London.

616
00:47:48,196 --> 00:47:50,865
Drayton told the concierge
he was a college professor.

617
00:47:51,908 --> 00:47:54,369
I don't think there's
anything we can do here, Jo.

618
00:47:54,494 --> 00:47:56,788
I can't bring the police in.

619
00:47:56,913 --> 00:47:59,082
I'd even thought of taking that chance.

620
00:47:59,207 --> 00:48:01,919
But the minute they connect
Hank's disappearance

621
00:48:02,044 --> 00:48:04,046
with Louis Bernard's murder,

622
00:48:04,463 --> 00:48:07,132
then the first thing they'll do
is make me tell them

623
00:48:07,299 --> 00:48:09,927
what Louis Bernard whispered to me
in the market place.

624
00:48:10,761 --> 00:48:13,014
That won't do Hank any good.

625
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:16,142
We're going to London.

626
00:48:16,768 --> 00:48:19,604
The Draytons had a private aeroplane.
I found that out.

627
00:48:19,729 --> 00:48:21,731
That's how they got Hank out of here.

628
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:26,361
It could land anyplace,
no trouble with passports or anything.

629
00:48:27,196 --> 00:48:29,198
So we're going to London to find him.

630
00:48:33,786 --> 00:48:37,915
Now, Jo... now listen to me.
This is what Bernard said.

631
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:41,085
"A man, a statesman,
is to be killed, assassinated,

632
00:48:41,211 --> 00:48:43,630
in London soon, very soon."

633
00:48:43,755 --> 00:48:47,676
"Tell them in London
to try Ambrose Chappell."

634
00:48:47,801 --> 00:48:49,678
That's the fella we've got to find.

635
00:48:49,803 --> 00:48:54,642
If he knows anything, I'm gonna offer him
every penny I have to get Hank back.

636
00:48:54,767 --> 00:48:57,812
The Chappell guy's our only hope.
Do you understand?

637
00:48:57,937 --> 00:49:00,648
I've got a car waiting downstairs.

638
00:49:00,773 --> 00:49:05,028
I've paid the hotel bill.
We get packed, we'll be all set.

639
00:49:05,153 --> 00:49:07,155
Honey?

640
00:49:08,698 --> 00:49:12,869
We don't have much time.
You'll have to get up and get ready.

641
00:49:13,870 --> 00:49:15,831
Please, Jo.

642
00:49:17,249 --> 00:49:20,085
Please, Jo.

643
00:49:41,233 --> 00:49:43,193
Would you just wait, sir?

644
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:46,447
- Come this way.
- Jo! Love from the fan club!

645
00:49:49,075 --> 00:49:51,369
How could they
remember me so well, Ben?

646
00:49:51,494 --> 00:49:53,538
It's been four years
since I played London.

647
00:49:53,705 --> 00:49:56,457
You're the kind of gal they don't forget.

648
00:49:57,417 --> 00:50:00,837
Who told them we were coming?
Ben, you didn't -

649
00:50:00,962 --> 00:50:05,676
I wired the Parnells to get us a hotel.
I never figured on anything like this.

650
00:50:12,057 --> 00:50:14,143
Dr and Mrs McKenna,

651
00:50:14,268 --> 00:50:17,605
I'm Inspector Edington of
the Criminal Investigation Department.

652
00:50:17,772 --> 00:50:22,110
As things are, there's no need for you
to go through customs. Come this way.

653
00:50:24,946 --> 00:50:26,573
How about a photo, Jo?

654
00:50:26,698 --> 00:50:28,200
Hi, Jo!

655
00:50:33,205 --> 00:50:35,207
This way, please.

656
00:50:35,332 --> 00:50:37,960
We want Jo!

657
00:50:42,131 --> 00:50:44,342
This is Mr Woburn. Dr and Mrs McKenna.

658
00:50:44,467 --> 00:50:47,137
- How do you do?
- What do you people want with us?

659
00:50:47,303 --> 00:50:50,891
- Mr Buchanan would like to talk to you.
- Who's he?

660
00:50:51,016 --> 00:50:53,185
Special Branch, Scotland Yard.

661
00:51:01,777 --> 00:51:04,447
This is Mr Buchanan.
Dr and Mrs McKenna.

662
00:51:04,572 --> 00:51:07,116
How do you do? Thank you, Woburn.

663
00:51:08,076 --> 00:51:10,078
Do sit down, won't you?

664
00:51:11,579 --> 00:51:15,500
Let me say we're shocked that your son
was taken from you in Marrakech,

665
00:51:15,667 --> 00:51:17,711
and deeply sympathetic.

666
00:51:17,836 --> 00:51:20,255
- Do you know where he is?
- Have you heard anything?

667
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:22,716
I only wish I could give you
some cheerful news,

668
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,387
but we might find him quite soon, indeed,
if we work together.

669
00:51:27,638 --> 00:51:30,516
Bernard the Frenchman
was sent to Morocco at our request

670
00:51:30,683 --> 00:51:33,770
to check up on an assassination plot
here in London.

671
00:51:33,895 --> 00:51:39,109
You know, a good agent keeps on
staking his life. He doesn't always win.

672
00:51:39,734 --> 00:51:42,237
Bernard reckoned you
were a man to trust.

673
00:51:42,362 --> 00:51:44,364
He relied on you to come to us.

674
00:51:44,531 --> 00:51:47,618
Those people kidnapped your boy
in order to keep your mouth shut.

675
00:51:49,578 --> 00:51:54,458
- That's right, isn't it?
- No, I think they took him for money.

676
00:51:54,584 --> 00:51:58,588
Why didn't you go to your consulate
in Casablanca? Why come to London?

677
00:51:58,713 --> 00:52:00,715
- Well, I...
- Mr Buchanan -

678
00:52:00,882 --> 00:52:03,134
You're convinced these people
brought your son to London.

679
00:52:03,259 --> 00:52:06,346
You're convinced you can find him
off your own bat.

680
00:52:06,513 --> 00:52:08,765
You can't. It's impossible.

681
00:52:08,890 --> 00:52:12,269
But with the help we can give you,
there's a chance.

682
00:52:12,394 --> 00:52:15,564
- A really good chance.
- But they told us not to say anything.

683
00:52:15,731 --> 00:52:18,859
Anything you tell me will be
in the most absolute confidence.

684
00:52:19,026 --> 00:52:21,028
Yes, that may be true, but -

685
00:52:21,154 --> 00:52:23,698
Your son is the trump card
these people hold.

686
00:52:23,823 --> 00:52:25,825
He's perfectly safe for the moment.

687
00:52:25,950 --> 00:52:28,954
When they've done what they want,
they'll let him go.

688
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:31,123
Are we supposed to just sit and wait?

689
00:52:31,248 --> 00:52:36,795
If they consider your boy a nuisance,
afterwards, I'm afraid...

690
00:52:37,421 --> 00:52:40,758
There's no need for you to try
and scare us, Mr Buchanan.

691
00:52:40,883 --> 00:52:44,345
That's exactly what I am trying to do -
scare you.

692
00:52:44,470 --> 00:52:48,641
I'm trying to prevent
a man being murdered here in London.

693
00:52:48,766 --> 00:52:50,935
If you don't tell me all you know,

694
00:52:51,102 --> 00:52:53,897
you become an accessory
before the fact of murder.

695
00:52:54,022 --> 00:52:56,983
- Ben, what can we do by ourselves?
- Now, wait just a minute.

696
00:52:57,109 --> 00:53:00,112
You've been working
on the wrong McKenna.

697
00:53:00,279 --> 00:53:04,116
- Bernard talked to me, not my wife.
- Then, you tell me.

698
00:53:04,283 --> 00:53:08,287
He spoke to me in French.
I don't understand a word of it.

699
00:53:08,454 --> 00:53:11,040
Oh, Ben,
maybe they could find those people.

700
00:53:11,165 --> 00:53:13,167
Maybe's not good enough for me.

701
00:53:13,293 --> 00:53:15,295
I don't think it ought to be
good enough for you.

702
00:53:15,462 --> 00:53:19,132
- You're not the only one concerned -
- I didn't mean it that way.

703
00:53:19,299 --> 00:53:22,260
We made up our minds
what we're gonna do. Let's stick to it.

704
00:53:24,638 --> 00:53:27,307
I'm sorry, Mr Buchanan, we...

705
00:53:27,474 --> 00:53:31,395
we'd like to cooperate with you
on this thing, but we just can't.

706
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,981
I've got a son of my own.

707
00:53:35,608 --> 00:53:37,527
I don't know what I'd do.

708
00:53:37,652 --> 00:53:39,654
Excuse me.

709
00:53:47,871 --> 00:53:50,207
Telephone call for you, Mrs McKenna.

710
00:53:52,334 --> 00:53:55,838
Put the telephone call for Mrs McKenna
through here please.

711
00:54:03,179 --> 00:54:05,557
- Hello.
- Mrs McKenna?

712
00:54:05,682 --> 00:54:10,228
- Yes.
- This is Mrs Drayton. Remember me?

713
00:54:10,353 --> 00:54:12,356
Mrs Drayton.

714
00:54:12,522 --> 00:54:14,775
Where is our son?
Where have you got him?

715
00:54:17,903 --> 00:54:21,532
He's here with me.
You mustn't worry about him.

716
00:54:21,699 --> 00:54:23,868
Where's our son?
Where have you got him?

717
00:54:24,035 --> 00:54:26,371
I expect you'd like to speak to him.

718
00:54:26,537 --> 00:54:28,873
Yes, please. Please.

719
00:54:30,834 --> 00:54:35,255
- Hank! Hello, Hank!
- Just a minute.

720
00:54:38,967 --> 00:54:41,220
Mommy? Mommy, is that you?

721
00:54:41,387 --> 00:54:44,890
Oh, Hank darling,
are you really all right?

722
00:54:45,057 --> 00:54:50,021
I'm a little scared, Mommy,
but I'm all right, I guess.

723
00:54:50,188 --> 00:54:54,108
I miss you, Mommy. I miss you so much!

724
00:54:54,234 --> 00:54:58,572
Oh, here. Hank. Hank, this is Daddy.

725
00:54:58,738 --> 00:55:01,908
- Is Mommy crying?
- Hank, listen to me.

726
00:55:02,075 --> 00:55:06,288
Where are you? Where are you?

727
00:55:06,413 --> 00:55:11,585
I didn't mean to make her cry, Daddy,
but I'm scared and I want to see her.

728
00:55:11,752 --> 00:55:16,215
Hank, now listen to me.
Tell me - where are you?

729
00:55:17,967 --> 00:55:20,303
- Welbeck, eight...
- Yeah?

730
00:55:20,428 --> 00:55:22,764
Eight? Come on, Hank.

731
00:55:22,889 --> 00:55:24,891
Hank!

732
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:41,576
Ben, he was so scared.

733
00:55:47,874 --> 00:55:50,460
It was a London telephone exchange.

734
00:55:50,627 --> 00:55:53,505
Public call box - West One.

735
00:55:53,630 --> 00:55:57,134
Do I have to say any more?
Come on, dear.

736
00:55:57,301 --> 00:55:59,553
You may change your minds.

737
00:56:00,846 --> 00:56:02,848
If you do...

738
00:56:04,392 --> 00:56:06,394
this number will find me.

739
00:56:08,521 --> 00:56:14,528
Baggage for Air France flight 592.

740
00:56:24,872 --> 00:56:26,874
- Everything all right, sir?
- Yeah, yeah.

741
00:56:26,999 --> 00:56:29,168
- Your room key.
- Thank you.

742
00:56:29,335 --> 00:56:31,629
Oh, uh, here.

743
00:56:31,754 --> 00:56:33,965
- Thank you, sir.
- There you are.

744
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:36,760
It's from the Parnells.
'Welcome home, Jo.

745
00:56:36,885 --> 00:56:39,888
Look forward to seeing your family,
especially the little - '

746
00:56:52,568 --> 00:56:56,197
'With love, from Jan and Cindy.'
That's very nice.

747
00:57:02,454 --> 00:57:04,456
'Ambrose Chappell.'

748
00:57:04,581 --> 00:57:10,295
There he is, big as life.
'61 Burdett Street, Camden Town,

749
00:57:10,421 --> 00:57:13,007
Gulliver 6198.'

750
00:57:13,174 --> 00:57:15,176
What are you going to say?

751
00:57:15,301 --> 00:57:19,305
That I'll keep my mouth shut
and offer him all the money we have.

752
00:57:21,015 --> 00:57:23,309
Operator?

753
00:57:23,434 --> 00:57:28,023
Operator, I want Gulliver 6198.

754
00:57:28,148 --> 00:57:30,650
I'll get it.

755
00:57:34,238 --> 00:57:36,198
Jo! Oh, you look wonderful!

756
00:57:36,365 --> 00:57:38,450
When we got your wire,
I couldn't believe it.

757
00:57:38,576 --> 00:57:41,412
- What were you doing in Morocco?
- Sightseeing.

758
00:57:41,537 --> 00:57:45,375
You're the perfect answer to what
London needs, Jo. This week's so dull.

759
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:47,502
Ambrose Chappell?

760
00:57:47,627 --> 00:57:49,379
Mr Ambrose Chappell?

761
00:57:49,546 --> 00:57:52,048
Oh, Mr Conway,
I didn't know you were there.

762
00:57:52,215 --> 00:57:55,385
McKenna! Dr McKenna.
Welcome to London town, Doctor.

763
00:57:55,510 --> 00:57:57,846
I knew you were married, but a doctor?

764
00:57:57,971 --> 00:58:01,016
How clever. Especially in
such a psychosomatic business.

765
00:58:01,141 --> 00:58:05,938
Jan, be quiet. You wouldn't know
what psychosomatic means.

766
00:58:06,063 --> 00:58:08,524
It's when your mind gets sick
of your body.

767
00:58:08,649 --> 00:58:13,321
- The doctor's trying to telephone.
- No, no. It's just some business.

768
00:58:13,446 --> 00:58:16,992
Business is everything. Shh.

769
00:58:17,117 --> 00:58:20,203
Hello. Hello? Ambrose Chappell.

770
00:58:20,329 --> 00:58:22,956
I say, is this Mr Ambrose Chappell?

771
00:58:23,123 --> 00:58:25,459
My name's McKenna.

772
00:58:25,626 --> 00:58:28,254
Dr Benjamin McKenna.

773
00:58:29,964 --> 00:58:32,842
We don't need to be quiet.
How about a drink?

774
00:58:32,967 --> 00:58:36,262
I was wondering
if you'd be at your address for a while.

775
00:58:36,387 --> 00:58:39,724
I'd like to talk to you for a few minutes.

776
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:41,851
Thank you. I'll be right over.

777
00:58:43,437 --> 00:58:45,605
I'd like all of you to meet my husband.

778
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:48,692
I've heard so much about you.
It's nice to see you in person.

779
00:58:48,817 --> 00:58:51,320
This is Val's wife, Helen.

780
00:58:51,487 --> 00:58:56,158
You look just like those pictures Jo had.
Haven't changed a bit.

781
00:58:56,325 --> 00:58:59,454
Why should he? He's a doctor.
Probably gets free hormones.

782
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:02,123
I'm Jan Peterson.
I sing almost as well as your wife.

783
00:59:03,333 --> 00:59:06,836
And this is Cindy Fontaine
from Harrisburg, PA.

784
00:59:07,003 --> 00:59:09,381
Oh, Harrisburg. Been back home lately?

785
00:59:09,506 --> 00:59:11,842
How can I?
They know me there As Elva McDuff.

786
00:59:12,009 --> 00:59:14,053
It doesn't quite fit me any more.

787
00:59:14,178 --> 00:59:17,139
Where's your boy? I'd like to see
which one of you he looks like.

788
00:59:17,264 --> 00:59:21,185
He's staying with some other people
so we could have some time alone.

789
00:59:21,352 --> 00:59:24,605
- What's his name?
- Hank. Henry, really.

790
00:59:24,731 --> 00:59:28,401
I hope he looks like you
and has the doctor's brains.

791
00:59:29,444 --> 00:59:31,446
These flowers are lovely -

792
00:59:31,571 --> 00:59:33,573
Well, I'll order some drinks.

793
00:59:33,698 --> 00:59:37,035
OK, but dinner tonight's on me,
a 'welcome home' for Jo.

794
00:59:37,202 --> 00:59:40,122
I wish I could persuade
her to stay a month.

795
00:59:40,247 --> 00:59:43,083
I'm terribly sorry,
but I have an appointment.

796
00:59:43,209 --> 00:59:47,046
I wonder if you'd order the drinks.
I'll be back as soon as I can.

797
00:59:47,213 --> 00:59:50,008
- Excuse me, please.
- Ben, please.

798
00:59:50,383 --> 00:59:52,385
- Ben...
- It's got to be done.

799
00:59:52,552 --> 00:59:55,680
- Take me with you.
- I can't. I won't disappear.

800
00:59:55,847 --> 00:59:59,851
- Please let me go with you.
- Two are easier to follow than one.

801
01:00:00,018 --> 01:00:03,188
We don't want Buchanan's men
or the others on our tracks.

802
01:00:03,313 --> 01:00:06,025
I'm going out through
the service entrance.

803
01:02:57,416 --> 01:02:59,418
- Yes, sir?
- Ambrose Chappell?

804
01:02:59,585 --> 01:03:01,545
Come in.

805
01:03:07,927 --> 01:03:09,929
There's a gent to see you, sir.

806
01:03:18,021 --> 01:03:20,816
Good afternoon, sir.
I am Ambrose Chappell.

807
01:03:20,941 --> 01:03:22,901
What can I do for you?

808
01:03:23,777 --> 01:03:25,905
Well, I - I, uh -

809
01:03:26,030 --> 01:03:28,449
If you gave me your name,
that might be a start.

810
01:03:28,616 --> 01:03:33,162
My name is McKenna.
Dr Benjamin McKenna.

811
01:03:33,287 --> 01:03:35,832
- I phoned you.
- Oh, yes, yes.

812
01:03:35,957 --> 01:03:39,336
You are Ambrose Chappell?

813
01:03:39,461 --> 01:03:43,465
Well, I've been Ambrose Chappell
for nearly 71 years.

814
01:03:43,632 --> 01:03:46,426
But, uh...
I think I understand your problem.

815
01:03:46,552 --> 01:03:48,512
- You do, huh?
- Certainly.

816
01:03:48,637 --> 01:03:52,349
It happens all the time.
You expected someone else?

817
01:03:52,892 --> 01:03:55,728
Just a moment. Ambrose?

818
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:02,277
I think this gentleman
wants to talk to us.

819
01:04:08,408 --> 01:04:12,329
Now, Father, why don't you
go and have a nice rest?

820
01:04:12,454 --> 01:04:15,207
Hm? I have centuries of rest
ahead of me, thank you.

821
01:04:15,332 --> 01:04:17,334
Good day to you, sir.

822
01:04:18,461 --> 01:04:21,214
- Now, what can I do for you?
- I'm Dr McKenna.

823
01:04:23,549 --> 01:04:27,637
- That name mean anything to you?
- No. No, I don't think so.

824
01:04:28,221 --> 01:04:30,056
You've no idea why I'm here?

825
01:04:32,392 --> 01:04:34,561
My dear sir, I haven't the faintest idea.

826
01:04:35,437 --> 01:04:39,775
But your name was given to me
by someone I met in Marrakech.

827
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:43,988
- Oh, yes?
- Yes, and I think you know this man.

828
01:04:44,155 --> 01:04:49,160
- Louis Bernard, a Frenchman.
- Louis Bernard?

829
01:04:49,994 --> 01:04:54,332
Let's stop fooling around. Bernard
told me to come here just before he died.

830
01:04:55,375 --> 01:04:58,337
This man is... dead?

831
01:04:58,462 --> 01:05:00,464
You know he's dead just as well as I do.

832
01:05:00,589 --> 01:05:03,842
Now, I have a business proposition.
I don't see how you can turn it down.

833
01:05:11,267 --> 01:05:16,523
- Exactly what had you in mind?
- Well er... You want to talk here?

834
01:05:16,648 --> 01:05:19,484
Certainly.
We have no secrets from our employees.

835
01:05:21,069 --> 01:05:23,030
OK, now, in the first place,

836
01:05:23,155 --> 01:05:27,117
I haven't uttered a word of what Bernard
told me before he died, and I never will.

837
01:05:27,660 --> 01:05:30,371
Frankly, I'm not interested
in political intrigue.

838
01:05:30,538 --> 01:05:33,457
I don't care who you fellows
are gonna kill in London.

839
01:05:33,583 --> 01:05:37,795
All I want's that boy, and I'll take
the next aeroplane back to America.

840
01:05:38,379 --> 01:05:40,924
Come on, please. Listen to me, will ya?

841
01:05:41,091 --> 01:05:44,553
Honestly, if money means anything to you,
I'll do...

842
01:05:44,678 --> 01:05:48,015
Father, call the police.
Shall we go into this -

843
01:05:48,140 --> 01:05:51,935
Wait a minute.
You told him to call the police.

844
01:05:52,102 --> 01:05:55,439
- What's the idea, trying to bluff me?
- My dear sir -

845
01:05:55,564 --> 01:05:58,901
- And you don't know Louis Bernard?
- Never heard of him.

846
01:05:59,026 --> 01:06:01,654
You've got no idea what happened
in Marrakech and where my boy is?

847
01:06:01,779 --> 01:06:03,781
- No.
- Where is he?

848
01:06:03,948 --> 01:06:06,534
William! Edgar! Davis! Help!

849
01:06:08,119 --> 01:06:10,622
Now, wait a minute! Wait! Hold on.

850
01:06:10,789 --> 01:06:15,252
It's obvious I'm in the wrong place.
Now, let go of me.

851
01:06:29,058 --> 01:06:31,394
I made a mistake. Now, let me go.

852
01:06:41,113 --> 01:06:43,115
Hold him! Hold him!

853
01:06:47,161 --> 01:06:48,955
Ouch!

854
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:51,082
Hold him. Hold him.

855
01:06:57,797 --> 01:07:01,134
He said that even if Bud Flanagan
was dressed by Hartnell,

856
01:07:01,259 --> 01:07:03,554
nobody would believe
he was an aristocrat.

857
01:07:03,679 --> 01:07:06,473
So I said, "Listen, Chris,

858
01:07:06,598 --> 01:07:10,019
why don't you take William
Hickey's column out of the paper?"

859
01:07:10,144 --> 01:07:13,773
Jo? Jo, what's become of that
unpredictable husband of yours?

860
01:07:13,898 --> 01:07:15,691
He's been gone over an hour now.

861
01:07:15,858 --> 01:07:20,488
- He went to see some man. Church?
- No, it was Chappell.

862
01:07:28,205 --> 01:07:30,749
It's not a man. It's a place.

863
01:07:34,461 --> 01:07:36,464
It's Ambrose Chapel!

864
01:07:36,589 --> 01:07:40,051
- Do they list chapels in the directory?
- Let's take a look.

865
01:07:40,218 --> 01:07:42,178
Please help me find it.

866
01:07:42,887 --> 01:07:46,599
Let's see. Here we are. Ambrose...

867
01:07:46,725 --> 01:07:50,562
Ambrose and Chafer...
Ambrose Chapel! 17 Ambrose Street, W2.

868
01:07:50,687 --> 01:07:52,689
17 Ambrose Street, W2.

869
01:07:52,814 --> 01:07:55,818
17 Ambrose Street, W2.

870
01:07:55,943 --> 01:07:58,362
17 Ambrose Street.

871
01:08:00,197 --> 01:08:02,199
Look, darlings, I have to go.

872
01:08:02,325 --> 01:08:05,495
I'm very sorry. Have another drink.
I'll be back as soon as I can.

873
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:08,164
And explain to Ben when he comes in,
would you?

874
01:08:08,289 --> 01:08:11,459
Explain what?

875
01:08:26,183 --> 01:08:28,978
Look, there's something
weird going on here and I -

876
01:08:29,103 --> 01:08:31,939
Let's try to figure the whole thing out.
First, there was a man named -

877
01:08:32,065 --> 01:08:34,776
- Ambrose Chappell.
- And Ben dashed off to see him.

878
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:37,904
Then Jo said it wasn't a man but a place
and she dashed off.

879
01:08:38,071 --> 01:08:40,907
Don't mention it again,
or I might dash off.

880
01:08:41,033 --> 01:08:43,452
- What a temptation.
- Can you fathom it?

881
01:08:43,577 --> 01:08:48,082
It's probably some new American gag.

882
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:52,253
- Well, hello again.
- Oh.

883
01:08:52,378 --> 01:08:56,049
I'm awfully sorry I had to rush off,
but there was something I had to do.

884
01:08:56,174 --> 01:08:59,052
Oh, boy, I could use this.

885
01:08:59,177 --> 01:09:03,098
Thank you. Well, I - Where's Jo?

886
01:09:03,223 --> 01:09:05,809
- She's gone to Ambrose Chapel.
- I just came from there.

887
01:09:05,976 --> 01:09:10,439
- Not your Ambrose Chappell.
- It isn't a he, it's a building.

888
01:09:10,564 --> 01:09:12,942
She just left 20 minutes ago.

889
01:09:13,067 --> 01:09:17,113
She... What? What do you mean?

890
01:09:17,238 --> 01:09:20,408
- Where's the address?
- I'll look it up again.

891
01:09:20,533 --> 01:09:23,244
What is this? You say it's a building?

892
01:09:23,369 --> 01:09:26,706
Ambrose Chapel,
17 Ambrose Street, Bayswater.

893
01:09:26,831 --> 01:09:28,834
17 Ambrose Street, Bayswater.

894
01:09:32,296 --> 01:09:36,467
Yes? Doctor!
Doctor, come back! It's Jo.

895
01:09:40,221 --> 01:09:42,890
- Jo?
- Ben? What happened?

896
01:09:43,015 --> 01:09:47,979
- No. It was a wild-goose chase.
- It must be the chapel. I've found it.

897
01:09:48,104 --> 01:09:51,316
It's just a short way from here.

898
01:09:51,483 --> 01:09:53,819
I know the address. I'll be right over.

899
01:09:53,944 --> 01:09:55,237
I'll meet you outside.

900
01:09:55,362 --> 01:09:57,865
Bye, dear.
What did you say the address was?

901
01:09:58,031 --> 01:10:00,868
17 Ambrose Street, Bayswater.

902
01:10:00,993 --> 01:10:02,995
I don't know how to thank you.

903
01:11:00,515 --> 01:11:04,185
Three men. You don't know much
about checkers, do you?

904
01:11:04,310 --> 01:11:07,230
You'd better go to bed,
or you'll be overtired.

905
01:11:07,355 --> 01:11:09,524
Can I finish? I'm winning.

906
01:11:09,649 --> 01:11:13,570
Yes, finish.
Edna, see he has some milk and biscuits.

907
01:11:13,695 --> 01:11:16,740
He'd better be put to sleep.
I've got to get downstairs.

908
01:11:16,907 --> 01:11:21,203
No, it's not necessary tonight.
You'll sleep, Hank, won't you?

909
01:11:21,329 --> 01:11:25,208
- I guess so.
- Oh, hurry up, if you want to finish this.

910
01:11:25,333 --> 01:11:28,670
Look, it doesn't hurt to be kind, does it?

911
01:11:30,296 --> 01:11:33,216
Give me a yell
when you want me to unlock the door.

912
01:11:44,353 --> 01:11:46,689
- Can I come in?
- Yes.

913
01:12:13,676 --> 01:12:15,637
I wish it was tomorrow.

914
01:12:15,803 --> 01:12:18,306
That's not a very orthodox sentiment.

915
01:12:20,850 --> 01:12:22,811
Ah, before I forget.

916
01:12:23,687 --> 01:12:25,689
Here you are, my friend.

917
01:12:25,856 --> 01:12:30,569
Two tickets for the concert
at the Albert Hall, with my compliments.

918
01:12:30,694 --> 01:12:32,822
Your box is nicely placed.

919
01:12:32,947 --> 01:12:35,491
Or, should we say, strategically placed.

920
01:12:36,534 --> 01:12:39,203
- And now for the most important part.
- What is it?

921
01:12:39,370 --> 01:12:42,123
A record of the delightful piece
they're going to play.

922
01:12:42,248 --> 01:12:45,752
Music's less in your line
than marksmanship.

923
01:12:46,795 --> 01:12:51,216
If you listen, I'm going to play you
the exact moment when you can shoot.

924
01:12:51,383 --> 01:12:53,343
So listen carefully.

925
01:12:53,510 --> 01:12:57,348
# Finding...

926
01:12:58,599 --> 01:13:02,854
# Release! #

927
01:13:02,979 --> 01:13:07,275
We'll have it once more.
Listen for the crash of the cymbals.

928
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:11,029
# Finding...

929
01:13:12,405 --> 01:13:16,618
# Release! #

930
01:13:19,913 --> 01:13:24,377
You see? At such a moment,
your shot will never be heard.

931
01:13:24,502 --> 01:13:26,796
Even the listeners
will be undisturbed.

932
01:13:26,921 --> 01:13:31,301
I think the composer would've
appreciated that. No-one will know.

933
01:13:32,260 --> 01:13:37,891
- No-one except one. - That's
right, if you're clever, my friend.

934
01:13:38,892 --> 01:13:42,688
- Any questions, musical or otherwise?
- No.

935
01:13:42,813 --> 01:13:46,233
There's one comforting thought -
it happens early in the evening.

936
01:13:46,358 --> 01:13:50,863
I hope I shan't upset you if I tell you
you've only time for one shot.

937
01:13:50,988 --> 01:13:54,325
- If you need another, the risk is yours.
- I don't take risks.

938
01:13:54,450 --> 01:13:56,452
I'm very glad to hear that.

939
01:13:56,619 --> 01:14:00,415
Traipsing all the way to Marrakech
for you, I should like you to do me credit.

940
01:14:01,875 --> 01:14:03,877
Your distinguished target
is already on his way.

941
01:14:04,002 --> 01:14:07,381
There's a car waiting for you downstairs
in the back entrance.

942
01:14:07,923 --> 01:14:12,720
You're to pick up a Miss Benson
on the way. She'll be your companion.

943
01:14:12,845 --> 01:14:16,641
She'll lend you an air of respectability,
if that's possible.

944
01:14:17,809 --> 01:14:20,770
Will you have the money
when I return?

945
01:14:21,312 --> 01:14:23,231
Don't you trust me?

946
01:14:25,066 --> 01:14:27,277
What is your English proverb?

947
01:14:27,444 --> 01:14:30,030
"A wolf in sheep's clothing."

948
01:14:31,114 --> 01:14:34,743
A very clever disguise, I must say.

949
01:14:34,868 --> 01:14:39,040
I think you'd better be going.
It's impolite to be late for a concert.

950
01:14:39,165 --> 01:14:43,836
And it would be awkward if they made
you wait until the first item was over.

951
01:14:44,963 --> 01:14:48,425
- Will you show our friend to the car?
- Yes, of course.

952
01:14:48,550 --> 01:14:53,388
I'm sorry you have to sneak out, but
we must preserve a respectable front.

953
01:15:03,941 --> 01:15:08,112
# Finding...

954
01:15:09,322 --> 01:15:11,908
# Release!

955
01:15:44,818 --> 01:15:46,653
There it is.

956
01:15:49,073 --> 01:15:53,536
Yeah. You just may have hit it
right on the nose.

957
01:15:53,703 --> 01:15:56,706
You can't be farther wrong than I was.

958
01:15:56,831 --> 01:15:59,876
- Let's go.
- Should we get help from the police?

959
01:16:00,043 --> 01:16:03,171
No, honey, please.
Let's take a crack at this alone.

960
01:16:19,563 --> 01:16:26,488
# Portents abound

961
01:16:26,613 --> 01:16:29,366
That earth

962
01:16:29,491 --> 01:16:32,661
# And heav'n

963
01:16:32,786 --> 01:16:35,956
# Amaze

964
01:16:36,123 --> 01:16:38,542
# Wherefore

965
01:16:38,667 --> 01:16:41,837
# Do earthquakes

966
01:16:41,962 --> 01:16:46,926
# Cleave the ground?

967
01:16:47,093 --> 01:16:52,432
# Why hides the sun

968
01:16:52,557 --> 01:16:56,561
# In shame?

969
01:16:58,271 --> 01:17:01,692
# Let sin no more...

970
01:17:01,817 --> 01:17:04,111
- Ben.
- Ssh, ssh!

971
01:17:04,236 --> 01:17:09,951
# My soul enslave

972
01:17:10,076 --> 01:17:13,287
# Break now...

973
01:17:13,454 --> 01:17:19,169
# This is just another wild goose chase

974
01:17:19,336 --> 01:17:22,923
- # O save me
- # Let's wait -

975
01:17:23,048 --> 01:17:28,012
- # Whom Thou camst
- # And look around

976
01:17:28,178 --> 01:17:30,764
# To save

977
01:17:30,890 --> 01:17:34,644
# Nor bleed

978
01:17:34,769 --> 01:17:40,733
- # Nor die in vain
- # Look who's coming down the aisle

979
01:17:43,403 --> 01:17:45,906
# From whence

980
01:17:46,031 --> 01:17:48,408
# These dire

981
01:17:48,533 --> 01:17:53,872
# Portents abound?

982
01:17:54,039 --> 01:17:59,545
# That earth and heav'n

983
01:17:59,712 --> 01:18:03,174
# Amaze

984
01:18:03,633 --> 01:18:06,344
# Wherefore

985
01:18:06,469 --> 01:18:09,890
# Do earthquakes

986
01:18:10,015 --> 01:18:15,020
# Cleave the ground?

987
01:18:15,145 --> 01:18:18,065
# Why hides

988
01:18:18,232 --> 01:18:21,235
# The sun

989
01:18:21,402 --> 01:18:25,323
# In shame?

990
01:18:28,952 --> 01:18:32,038
Let sin

991
01:18:32,205 --> 01:18:34,291
# No more

992
01:18:34,416 --> 01:18:39,838
# My soul enslave

993
01:18:39,963 --> 01:18:42,883
# Break now

994
01:18:43,008 --> 01:18:48,973
# The tyrant's chain

995
01:18:49,473 --> 01:18:52,977
# O save me

996
01:18:53,102 --> 01:18:57,774
# Whom Thou camst

997
01:18:57,941 --> 01:19:01,278
# To save

998
01:19:01,445 --> 01:19:03,989
# Nor bleed

999
01:19:04,114 --> 01:19:07,409
# Nor die

1000
01:19:07,534 --> 01:19:11,247
# In vain #

1001
01:19:20,006 --> 01:19:24,219
The subject of my address
to you this evening is adversity.

1002
01:19:25,178 --> 01:19:27,597
The average life,
yours and mine,

1003
01:19:27,723 --> 01:19:30,768
is often harassed and perplexed

1004
01:19:30,893 --> 01:19:33,812
by disappointments and by cruelties

1005
01:19:33,938 --> 01:19:36,315
beyond our control.

1006
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:41,195
Now, strangely enough, it is often
these things beyond our control...

1007
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:43,656
That's Buchanan's number.

1008
01:19:43,781 --> 01:19:47,786
Go out, call him up, tell him to surround
this place with police.

1009
01:19:47,953 --> 01:19:52,207
- What if he asks me -
- Tell him anything.

1010
01:19:52,332 --> 01:19:56,462
This is the time.
I'm sure Hank's round here someplace.

1011
01:19:58,297 --> 01:20:03,177
- But I don't want to leave you.
- I don't know how else to do it, honey.

1012
01:20:03,302 --> 01:20:05,304
You go on now.

1013
01:20:09,642 --> 01:20:12,646
and therefore
the goodness of all mankind.

1014
01:20:20,487 --> 01:20:23,574
Few of us pause

1015
01:20:23,699 --> 01:20:26,994
to consider how life's adversities
work in our behalf

1016
01:20:27,119 --> 01:20:29,455
to make better men and women of us.

1017
01:20:29,580 --> 01:20:32,834
But I think we should pause,
and pause now,

1018
01:20:32,959 --> 01:20:37,547
to do a little stocktaking,
to look into our own hearts and lives

1019
01:20:37,714 --> 01:20:39,674
and see what we find there.

1020
01:20:41,718 --> 01:20:44,680
Therefore,
instead of continuing the service,

1021
01:20:44,805 --> 01:20:47,641
I think we should all
return to our homes

1022
01:20:47,766 --> 01:20:52,563
for private meditation, remembering
how little we have to complain of

1023
01:20:52,730 --> 01:20:55,149
and how much to be grateful for.

1024
01:20:55,274 --> 01:20:59,362
Next week, I shall discuss
the fruits of our meditations.

1025
01:20:59,529 --> 01:21:03,283
Until then, my blessing
upon each and every one of you.

1026
01:22:09,979 --> 01:22:12,273
This is a pleasant surprise, Doctor.

1027
01:22:12,398 --> 01:22:14,567
Where's my boy, Drayton?

1028
01:22:14,692 --> 01:22:16,695
He's upstairs.

1029
01:22:16,820 --> 01:22:19,990
You've come just in time
to help my wife with his food.

1030
01:22:20,157 --> 01:22:23,118
It seems Hank doesn't care
for our English cooking.

1031
01:22:23,285 --> 01:22:25,120
What do you want?

1032
01:22:25,245 --> 01:22:28,374
I'll give you money, keep my mouth shut.
All I want's my boy.

1033
01:22:28,999 --> 01:22:33,629
And what about your wife? Did she
go outside just to get some fresh air?

1034
01:22:33,754 --> 01:22:35,965
Tell me what you want.
I'll do anything.

1035
01:22:36,132 --> 01:22:40,011
All right. You'll see your boy.
All in good time.

1036
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:43,557
Hank! Hank McKenna!

1037
01:22:44,433 --> 01:22:46,435
Daddy?

1038
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:48,187
Daddy! I'm here, Daddy!

1039
01:22:48,353 --> 01:22:49,813
I'm here!

1040
01:23:07,457 --> 01:23:09,626
My husband's there now, watching them.

1041
01:23:09,751 --> 01:23:12,963
He sent me to call you so you could
do something before they get away.

1042
01:23:13,088 --> 01:23:14,965
It isn't as easy as all that.

1043
01:23:15,090 --> 01:23:19,220
My husband is in that chapel
waiting for me to bring help.

1044
01:23:20,221 --> 01:23:24,475
May I speak to Mr Buchanan?
He told me to call him if I needed him.

1045
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:27,562
I'm awfully sorry.
I can't get in touch with him.

1046
01:23:27,729 --> 01:23:30,690
He's at an important diplomatic affair
at the Albert Hall.

1047
01:23:30,815 --> 01:23:33,026
Then call him there! Please call him.

1048
01:23:33,151 --> 01:23:35,862
He's on his way.
I don't know how -

1049
01:23:36,029 --> 01:23:39,116
Mr Woburn, it isn't a matter of days,
it's a matter of minutes.

1050
01:23:39,241 --> 01:23:42,369
Now, you've got to send
the police right away!

1051
01:23:42,494 --> 01:23:46,332
- Or do I have to go to Albert Hall myself?
- That won't be necessary.

1052
01:23:46,457 --> 01:23:48,918
I'll have the chapel
put under immediate observation.

1053
01:23:49,085 --> 01:23:51,546
By the time you get back,
a police car should be there.

1054
01:23:51,713 --> 01:23:55,842
Tell your husband to come out
and let the police take over.

1055
01:23:55,967 --> 01:23:58,887
Woburn, Special Branch. Hold on.
I must ring off, Mrs McKenna.

1056
01:23:59,012 --> 01:24:01,848
Please believe me.
I'll have everything laid on.

1057
01:24:33,090 --> 01:24:35,092
There's nobody there.

1058
01:24:35,217 --> 01:24:37,845
- Are you Mrs McKenna?
- Yes. There's something wrong, officer.

1059
01:24:37,970 --> 01:24:40,473
That place was full of people a few
minutes ago and now there's no-one.

1060
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:44,018
We are to keep it under observation
until the Scotland Yard car arrives.

1061
01:24:44,144 --> 01:24:47,230
But my husband is in there.
There were 30 or 40 people -

1062
01:24:47,355 --> 01:24:50,400
- When was this?
- No more than five minutes ago.

1063
01:24:50,525 --> 01:24:53,570
- Hm, let's take a look.
- I've tried the door. It's locked.

1064
01:24:53,695 --> 01:24:55,698
We'll have to force it open.

1065
01:24:55,823 --> 01:24:58,451
I'm sorry, madam. We can't break in.

1066
01:24:58,617 --> 01:25:01,579
- Requires a search warrant.
- Well, can't we get one?

1067
01:25:01,704 --> 01:25:05,541
That all takes time.
We'll have a look around, shall we?

1068
01:25:05,667 --> 01:25:07,669
Matthews, take the other end.

1069
01:25:34,239 --> 01:25:38,410
- There's no-one there.
- Are you certain this place was just full?

1070
01:25:38,535 --> 01:25:42,372
Of course I'm certain.
I was there myself with my husband.

1071
01:25:42,498 --> 01:25:45,459
He sent me out to call Scotland Yard.

1072
01:25:47,127 --> 01:25:50,339
I'm afraid it's much too complicated
to explain why.

1073
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:53,968
We'll just have to sit tight
and wait for the car from The Yard.

1074
01:26:00,475 --> 01:26:03,770
- There's no sign of life.
- Report back here.

1075
01:26:03,895 --> 01:26:07,107
Very good, sir. Walden, you stand by
and wait for the car from The Yard.

1076
01:26:07,232 --> 01:26:09,276
- That's all, Matthews.
- You're not leaving?

1077
01:26:09,401 --> 01:26:12,404
Orders, madam.
Can we give you a lift somewhere?

1078
01:26:13,239 --> 01:26:16,534
- Take me to Albert Hall, please.
- The Albert Hall's off our beat.

1079
01:26:16,659 --> 01:26:19,579
Suppose we drop you off
at the nearest taxi rank?

1080
01:27:38,496 --> 01:27:40,457
Wait here.

1081
01:27:46,421 --> 01:27:49,967
- They're here.
- Wait till I clear the kitchen.

1082
01:28:00,728 --> 01:28:03,898
Everybody out!
Into the corridor. Five minutes.

1083
01:28:04,024 --> 01:28:06,026
Come on!

1084
01:28:06,193 --> 01:28:09,029
Do as he tells you.
Come on. It'll only take a minute.

1085
01:28:09,154 --> 01:28:11,365
Come on. All of you, out.

1086
01:28:30,218 --> 01:28:32,179
All right. This way.

1087
01:28:34,681 --> 01:28:37,518
Always something funny going on
at this embassy.

1088
01:28:37,643 --> 01:28:41,647
- Bringing people in in secret.
- Give me the Swiss embassy anytime.

1089
01:28:41,772 --> 01:28:44,233
There's neutrality for you.

1090
01:30:04,777 --> 01:30:06,780
Please, may I see the manager?

1091
01:30:06,905 --> 01:30:09,741
I'm sorry, madam.
The manager's on duty in the lobby.

1092
01:30:09,866 --> 01:30:12,327
- So is his assistant.
- I must speak with them.

1093
01:30:12,494 --> 01:30:14,454
Over there somewhere.

1094
01:30:39,773 --> 01:30:41,942
You have a very nice
little boy, madame.

1095
01:30:42,526 --> 01:30:46,238
His safety will depend
upon you tonight.

1096
01:30:46,363 --> 01:30:49,158
Where is he? Where is he?

1097
01:31:00,921 --> 01:31:03,006
Good evening.

1098
01:31:03,131 --> 01:31:06,343
- Is that the prime minister?
- No, the ambassador.

1099
01:31:06,510 --> 01:31:09,179
His prime minister's
the one with the bald head.

1100
01:31:34,999 --> 01:31:38,336
- Your ticket, madam?
- I'm sorry. I'm looking for someone.

1101
01:32:13,206 --> 01:32:15,876
Cantata - Storm Clouds

1102
01:35:00,134 --> 01:35:02,262
# There came

1103
01:35:02,387 --> 01:35:04,806
# A whispered terror

1104
01:35:04,931 --> 01:35:09,102
# On the breeze

1105
01:35:10,187 --> 01:35:16,193
# And the dark forest shook

1106
01:35:18,279 --> 01:35:20,448
# And on the trembling trees

1107
01:35:20,614 --> 01:35:24,911
# Came the nameless fear

1108
01:35:25,495 --> 01:35:28,373
# And panic overtook

1109
01:35:28,498 --> 01:35:30,750
# And panic overtook

1110
01:35:30,875 --> 01:35:33,128
# Each flying creature

1111
01:35:33,295 --> 01:35:37,966
# Of the wild

1112
01:35:50,563 --> 01:35:54,150
# And when they all had fled

1113
01:35:54,275 --> 01:35:56,486
# And when they all had fled

1114
01:35:56,611 --> 01:35:59,322
# And when they all had fled

1115
01:35:59,448 --> 01:36:02,659
# And when they all had fled

1116
01:36:02,826 --> 01:36:05,496
# Yet stood the trees

1117
01:36:05,621 --> 01:36:08,165
# Yet stood the trees

1118
01:36:08,332 --> 01:36:12,295
# Yet stood the trees

1119
01:36:12,420 --> 01:36:16,883
# Around whose heads

1120
01:36:17,008 --> 01:36:19,052
# Screaming

1121
01:36:19,219 --> 01:36:25,100
# The night birds wheeled
and shot away

1122
01:36:29,730 --> 01:36:32,733
# Yet stood the trees

1123
01:36:32,900 --> 01:36:35,861
# Yet stood the trees

1124
01:36:36,028 --> 01:36:38,656
# Yet stood the trees

1125
01:36:38,781 --> 01:36:44,662
# Yet stood the trees

1126
01:36:44,788 --> 01:36:50,794
# Yet stood the trees

1127
01:36:50,919 --> 01:36:54,798
# Yet stood the trees

1128
01:36:54,923 --> 01:36:58,469
# Yet stood the trees

1129
01:36:58,594 --> 01:37:03,724
# Yet stood the trees

1130
01:37:03,850 --> 01:37:06,853
# Around

1131
01:37:06,978 --> 01:37:10,190
# Whose head

1132
01:37:10,315 --> 01:37:13,151
# Screaming

1133
01:37:13,276 --> 01:37:16,405
# The night birds

1134
01:37:16,572 --> 01:37:21,660
# Wheeled

1135
01:37:21,785 --> 01:37:27,250
# And shot

1136
01:37:31,963 --> 01:37:37,928
# Away

1137
01:38:13,591 --> 01:38:16,844
# Finding release

1138
01:38:17,011 --> 01:38:20,640
# From that which drove them
onward like their prey

1139
01:38:20,765 --> 01:38:23,226
# Yet stood the trees

1140
01:38:23,351 --> 01:38:26,021
# Finding release

1141
01:38:26,187 --> 01:38:30,317

1142
01:38:30,484 --> 01:38:33,529

01:38:33,695 --> 01:38:37,241

01:38:37,366 --> 01:38:39,952

1145
01:38:40,077 --> 01:38:42,079
# The storm clouds broke

1146
01:38:42,205 --> 01:38:44,749
# The storm clouds broke

1147
01:38:44,874 --> 01:38:47,919
# The storm clouds

1148
01:39:19,578 --> 01:39:22,581
# Finding release

1149
01:39:22,706 --> 01:39:26,877
# From that which drove them
onward like their prey

1150
01:39:27,044 --> 01:39:29,046

1151
01:39:29,171 --> 01:39:31,007

01:39:31,132 --> 01:39:32,967
# Finding release

1153
01:39:33,092 --> 01:39:36,221
# From that which drove them
onward like their prey

1154
01:39:36,387 --> 01:39:39,057
# Yet stood the trees

1155
01:39:39,224 --> 01:39:42,811
# Finding release

1156
01:39:42,936 --> 01:39:45,647
# Finding release

1157
01:39:45,772 --> 01:39:47,775
# The storm clouds broke

1158
01:39:47,941 --> 01:39:50,569
# The storm clouds broke

1159
01:39:55,533 --> 01:40:00,747
# The storm clouds broke
and drowned the dying moon

1160
01:40:01,164 --> 01:40:04,709
# The storm clouds broke

1161
01:40:04,834 --> 01:40:08,004
# And drowned the dying moon

1162
01:40:08,130 --> 01:40:11,925
# The storm clouds broke

1163
01:40:12,092 --> 01:40:15,387
# The storm clouds broke

1164
01:40:15,512 --> 01:40:21,269
# The storm clouds broke

1165
01:40:31,029 --> 01:40:33,240
# Finding release

1166
01:40:33,365 --> 01:40:37,119
# The storm clouds broke

01:40:37,286 --> 01:40:39,622
# Finding release

1168
01:40:39,747 --> 01:40:43,793
# The storm clouds broke

1169
01:40:43,959 --> 01:40:46,712
# Finding release

1170
01:40:46,838 --> 01:40:53,178
# The storm clouds broke

1171
01:40:58,016 --> 01:41:03,897
# Finding

1172
01:41:04,356 --> 01:41:07,109
# Release #

1173
01:41:31,302 --> 01:41:33,304
What happened?

1174
01:41:33,429 --> 01:41:35,515
I saw the gun.
He was pointing it at the Prime Minister.

1175
01:41:35,681 --> 01:41:37,683
He was going to kill him,
and I realised I had to scream.

1176
01:41:51,782 --> 01:41:55,619
- Then he didn't kill him?
- Your wife saved him.

1177
01:41:57,329 --> 01:41:59,332
Oh, there they are.

1178
01:41:59,457 --> 01:42:02,627
Please come over
and let the prime minister thank you.

1179
01:42:02,752 --> 01:42:06,089
It won't take very long.
Would you come along?

1180
01:42:12,512 --> 01:42:14,514
Oh, yes.

1181
01:42:15,641 --> 01:42:18,185
Yes. Prime Minister,
this is the young lady.

1182
01:42:18,310 --> 01:42:20,479
Dear lady, I'm forever in your debt.

1183
01:42:20,604 --> 01:42:22,565
This is her husband.

1184
01:42:22,690 --> 01:42:25,610
I trust you'll permit me
to wait upon you tomorrow

1185
01:42:25,776 --> 01:42:29,781
and to express
to you the depth of my gratitude.

1186
01:42:29,948 --> 01:42:34,870
- It wasn't -
- But it was, my dear lady. It was.

1187
01:42:35,036 --> 01:42:37,038
Will you excuse us.

1188
01:42:38,332 --> 01:42:40,417
Excuse me, but I have to go.

1189
01:42:48,843 --> 01:42:51,596
I think Mr Buchanan
would like a word with you.

1190
01:42:57,435 --> 01:42:59,479
Where's our boy? Where's Hank?

1191
01:42:59,646 --> 01:43:02,107
We can talk if you'll come in here.

1192
01:43:05,277 --> 01:43:07,237
So you both knew
the time and place all along.

1193
01:43:07,404 --> 01:43:08,822
Don't be a fool.

1194
01:43:08,989 --> 01:43:10,950
An odd coincidence,
both of you turning up here.

1195
01:43:11,117 --> 01:43:14,287
It's a pity you didn't contact
your assistant. He told us you were here.

1196
01:43:14,412 --> 01:43:17,415
- I beg your pardon?
- We need that help you offered.

1197
01:43:20,502 --> 01:43:22,462
Sir, we've questioned
the woman.

1198
01:43:22,629 --> 01:43:24,798
Said she bought a ticket which happened
to place her in the box

1199
01:43:24,965 --> 01:43:26,967
with the man
who did the shooting.

1200
01:43:27,092 --> 01:43:30,137
- If she knows anything, she won't say.
- I'll see her later.

1201
01:43:30,304 --> 01:43:33,140
- Very good, sir.
- Please tell me everything, now.

1202
01:43:33,265 --> 01:43:36,811
Everything.
There's still plenty of room for hope.

1203
01:43:45,862 --> 01:43:47,822
His Excellency will see you now.

1204
01:44:11,639 --> 01:44:13,683
And that's that, I suppose.

1205
01:44:13,850 --> 01:44:15,852
Yes. All right.

1206
01:44:19,857 --> 01:44:23,027
Excuse me, sir.
I have a lot to explain to you.

1207
01:44:24,236 --> 01:44:26,697
Something very unusual has happened.

1208
01:44:28,491 --> 01:44:31,202
I also have to have the money
to pay the marksman.

1209
01:44:31,869 --> 01:44:33,872
Wouldn't that be superfluous,

1210
01:44:33,997 --> 01:44:36,374
considering... that he's dead?

1211
01:44:43,882 --> 01:44:47,761
His aim wasn't quite as good
as you led me to expect.

1212
01:44:47,928 --> 01:44:51,390
The target merely received
a slight flesh wound in the arm.

1213
01:44:51,557 --> 01:44:53,976
Worse than useless.

1214
01:44:54,101 --> 01:44:58,273
Then your French friend panicked,
made a fatal crash,

1215
01:44:58,439 --> 01:45:00,567
landing on the floor of the Albert Hall.

1216
01:45:04,905 --> 01:45:07,699
I don't see how you
can blame me for that.

1217
01:45:07,824 --> 01:45:10,410
He was warmly recommended
by our people in Marrakech.

1218
01:45:10,536 --> 01:45:13,998
I'm glad that you are able
to treat the matter so lightly.

1219
01:45:14,123 --> 01:45:16,459
I'm holding a reception
here this evening.

1220
01:45:16,625 --> 01:45:20,338
In a few moments, I have to welcome
our prime minister as my guest of honour,

1221
01:45:20,463 --> 01:45:24,634
when I hoped and expected
that he would be totally unable to attend.

1222
01:45:26,302 --> 01:45:30,056
- That amuses you, no doubt.
- I don't know what to say...

1223
01:45:30,182 --> 01:45:31,516
No.

1224
01:45:34,436 --> 01:45:38,232
But I do. You have muddled everything
from the start.

1225
01:45:38,357 --> 01:45:40,860
Taking that child
with you from Marrakech.

1226
01:45:40,985 --> 01:45:44,447
Don't you realise that Americans
dislike having their children stolen?

1227
01:45:44,572 --> 01:45:47,617
How else could I make sure
that McKenna would keep quiet?

1228
01:45:47,784 --> 01:45:50,912
Then, to crown it all, you get cold feet

1229
01:45:51,037 --> 01:45:55,000
and come running along here to hide,
bringing the wretched child with you.

1230
01:45:55,125 --> 01:45:58,545
Don't you see what you've done
to the diplomatic status of this embassy?

1231
01:45:58,670 --> 01:46:00,756
I didn't think.
I only thought we could -

1232
01:46:00,881 --> 01:46:05,636
How are you going to get
the child out of here, eh? Eh? EH?

1233
01:46:06,512 --> 01:46:08,890
No difficulty about that, surely?
The car.

1234
01:46:09,015 --> 01:46:13,603
With plainclothes detectives planted
right 'round this building?

1235
01:46:13,728 --> 01:46:16,564
You English intellectuals
will be the death of us all.

1236
01:46:16,690 --> 01:46:18,692
I'll think of something.
Only give me time.

1237
01:46:18,859 --> 01:46:20,819
Time. Huh!

1238
01:46:28,202 --> 01:46:31,622
I want the child
removed from this embassy,

1239
01:46:31,747 --> 01:46:36,127
and removed in such a way
that he won't be able to say any more

1240
01:46:36,252 --> 01:46:38,254
where he has been tonight.

1241
01:46:38,379 --> 01:46:39,881
Oh, no!

1242
01:46:43,969 --> 01:46:46,972
- I'll see to it.
- Drayton!

1243
01:46:47,472 --> 01:46:50,017
I trust that nothing
will go wrong this time.

1244
01:46:56,482 --> 01:46:58,651
It would be very unfortunate for you if -

1245
01:47:00,570 --> 01:47:02,363
Yes, come in.

1246
01:47:05,116 --> 01:47:08,954
Your Excellency, the princess should be
arriving at any moment.

1247
01:47:21,592 --> 01:47:23,886
I recognised him. He recognised me.

1248
01:47:24,053 --> 01:47:26,931
He tried to get away, made a jump for it.
That was all.

1249
01:47:27,098 --> 01:47:29,601
Trying to liquidate
one of their own big shots.

1250
01:47:29,768 --> 01:47:32,604
I wish they'd stick to their usual custom
and do it in their own country.

1251
01:47:35,774 --> 01:47:37,734
Yes?

1252
01:47:39,445 --> 01:47:41,405
Buchanan speaking.

1253
01:47:44,867 --> 01:47:46,869
Right. Thank you.

1254
01:47:47,870 --> 01:47:49,872
The Draytons are at the embassy.

1255
01:47:49,997 --> 01:47:52,000
- The what?
- How do you know?

1256
01:47:52,125 --> 01:47:54,753
We have ways of finding out,
from the inside.

1257
01:47:54,919 --> 01:47:58,089
If the Draytons are at the embassy,
then our boy's there too.

1258
01:47:58,215 --> 01:48:02,427
- Probably. But we can't do anything.
- What do you mean?

1259
01:48:02,553 --> 01:48:05,180
Every embassy in a foreign country
has extra-territorial rights.

1260
01:48:05,305 --> 01:48:08,601
- What's that? - It's as if
the embassy is on foreign soil.

1261
01:48:08,726 --> 01:48:12,271
So they can steal kids
and get away with it? What is this!

1262
01:48:12,396 --> 01:48:16,109
We could have the Foreign Office serve
a writ on the ambassador.

1263
01:48:16,234 --> 01:48:19,779
I'm not responsible for the complications
of international law.

1264
01:48:19,946 --> 01:48:24,367
If only we had some positive proof
that your boy really is in there.

1265
01:48:31,041 --> 01:48:33,836
Say, wh-what's the phone number
of that embassy?

1266
01:48:34,003 --> 01:48:36,380
- You got it?
- What are you thinking of -

1267
01:48:36,505 --> 01:48:39,967
- Let me try something.
- Grosvenor 0-1-4-4.

1268
01:48:40,134 --> 01:48:42,804
Grosvenor 0-1-4-4, please.

1269
01:48:43,721 --> 01:48:46,308
That fellow that got shot's
a prime minister, isn't he?

1270
01:48:48,351 --> 01:48:51,813
Hello? Hello, I'd like to speak to
the prime minister, please.

1271
01:48:51,939 --> 01:48:54,108
Yeah, yeah. No, look...

1272
01:48:54,233 --> 01:48:56,986
Just tell him the lady that saved his life
would like to speak to him.

1273
01:48:57,111 --> 01:49:00,573
- It's very important.
- Ben, what do I say?

1274
01:49:00,698 --> 01:49:02,825
He wanted to visit with us
so he could thank you.

1275
01:49:02,950 --> 01:49:05,370
Tell him you want to come over
to the embassy tonight,

1276
01:49:05,495 --> 01:49:07,872
cos we're going to leave London
tomorrow.

1277
01:49:08,039 --> 01:49:09,958
Hello? Here you are.

1278
01:49:10,083 --> 01:49:11,585
Hello?

1279
01:49:11,710 --> 01:49:15,547
My dear lady, this is a charming surprise.

1280
01:49:16,548 --> 01:49:18,509
Uh-huh.

1281
01:49:19,510 --> 01:49:23,013
Mm-hm. Delighted. Delighted, delighted.

1282
01:49:23,180 --> 01:49:25,766
The ambassador too would be delighted.

1283
01:49:25,891 --> 01:49:28,269
Any friends of mine are friends of his.

1284
01:49:32,148 --> 01:49:33,983
He said all right.

1285
01:49:34,693 --> 01:49:37,654
- If he asks you, we're all set.
- What if they don't?

1286
01:49:37,821 --> 01:49:40,490
Have we ever been to a party
where they didn't ask you?

1287
01:49:40,615 --> 01:49:43,535
Now, your job is to hold
their attention, right?

1288
01:49:48,457 --> 01:49:51,043
Good evening -
Dr and Mrs McKenna.

1289
01:49:51,210 --> 01:49:53,671
How very nice to see you.

1290
01:49:53,796 --> 01:49:56,799
The prime minister's waiting for you.
Come this way.

1291
01:50:05,142 --> 01:50:06,977
Ah, madam!

1292
01:50:07,769 --> 01:50:11,440
- Good evening, good evening.
- Good evening.

1293
01:50:11,607 --> 01:50:15,152
This is the charming lady
who saved my life at the concert.

1294
01:50:15,277 --> 01:50:20,408
Madam, you saved the life of the one man
who's irreplaceable in our country.

1295
01:50:22,160 --> 01:50:25,080
I hear you are the famous Jo Conway,
madam?

1296
01:50:25,205 --> 01:50:28,500
- Yes, I'm Jo Conway.
- Perhaps we might...

1297
01:50:28,625 --> 01:50:31,420
I'm sure my wife would be delighted
to sing for you.

1298
01:50:31,545 --> 01:50:34,757
- Wouldn't you, dear?
- Well, it's been quite some time...

1299
01:50:34,882 --> 01:50:36,175
I beg you, madam.

1300
01:50:36,300 --> 01:50:40,137
A tranquil coda
to conclude a dramatic evening.

1301
01:50:40,304 --> 01:50:41,556
I'm very flattered.

1302
01:50:41,681 --> 01:50:43,808
Um, Stanis?

1303
01:50:44,767 --> 01:50:47,437
Would you put up some chairs?
And hurry up, please.

1304
01:50:47,562 --> 01:50:53,402
Ladies and gentlemen, Jo Conway has
consented to sing a few songs for us.

1305
01:50:54,403 --> 01:50:57,990
Darling, would you see
that the prime minister gets a good seat.

1306
01:50:59,366 --> 01:51:03,621
Would you like to come to the piano?
I do hope it's tuned.

1307
01:51:03,746 --> 01:51:06,958
- Would you not like to sit down, sir?
- Er...

1308
01:51:07,124 --> 01:51:09,794
No, thank you. I'll just stand over here.

1309
01:51:26,270 --> 01:51:29,148
# When I was just a little girl

1310
01:51:29,273 --> 01:51:33,778
# I asked my mother, What will I be?

1311
01:51:33,903 --> 01:51:38,575
# Will I be pretty? Will I be rich?

1312
01:51:38,700 --> 01:51:42,913
# Here's what she said to me

1313
01:51:43,038 --> 01:51:47,543
# Que sera, sera

1314
01:51:47,709 --> 01:51:51,505
# Whatever will be, will be

1315
01:51:52,339 --> 01:51:55,676
# The future's not ours to see

1316
01:51:56,135 --> 01:51:59,889
# Que sera, sera

1317
01:52:00,056 --> 01:52:04,978
# What will be, will be

1318
01:52:05,145 --> 01:52:08,774
# When I was just a child in school

1319
01:52:08,899 --> 01:52:12,152
# I asked my teacher, What should I try?

1320
01:52:13,237 --> 01:52:17,324
# Should I paint pictures?
Should I sing songs?

1321
01:52:17,450 --> 01:52:20,828
# This was her wise reply

1322
01:52:20,953 --> 01:52:25,208
# Que sera, sera

1323
01:52:25,333 --> 01:52:29,546
# Whatever will be, will be

1324
01:52:29,671 --> 01:52:33,091
# The future's not ours to see

1325
01:52:43,269 --> 01:52:46,230
# When I grew up and fell in love

1326
01:52:46,355 --> 01:52:52,070
# I asked my sweetheart,
What lies ahead?

1327
01:52:52,195 --> 01:52:57,200
# Will we have rainbows day after day

1328
01:52:57,325 --> 01:53:00,787
# Here's what my sweetheart said

1329
01:53:00,913 --> 01:53:05,042
# Que sera, sera

1330
01:53:05,167 --> 01:53:09,630
# Whatever will be, will be

1331
01:53:09,755 --> 01:53:14,218
# The future's not ours to see...

1332
01:53:14,385 --> 01:53:16,387
That's my mother's voice!

1333
01:53:16,513 --> 01:53:20,225
- That's my mother singing!
- What?

1334
01:53:21,852 --> 01:53:23,895
Are you sure, Hank?

1335
01:53:24,021 --> 01:53:26,023
Are you quite sure?

1336
01:53:26,148 --> 01:53:27,983
That's her! I know it!

1337
01:53:30,486 --> 01:53:32,446
What's she doing here?

1338
01:53:46,837 --> 01:53:49,798
Hank, can you whistle that song?

1339
01:53:49,923 --> 01:53:51,967
I guess so.

1340
01:53:54,303 --> 01:53:56,263
Then go on. Whistle it.

1341
01:53:56,430 --> 01:53:58,933
Whistle it as loud as you can.

1342
01:54:09,778 --> 01:54:12,364
# Will we have rainbows

1343
01:54:12,531 --> 01:54:14,908
# Day after day?

1344
01:54:15,033 --> 01:54:18,454
# Here's what my sweetheart said

1345
01:54:23,584 --> 01:54:27,547
# Ever will be, will be

1346
01:54:27,714 --> 01:54:31,009
# The future's not ours to see

1347
01:54:31,176 --> 01:54:33,637
# Que sera, sera

1348
01:54:34,763 --> 01:54:38,642
# What will be, will be

1349
01:54:38,767 --> 01:54:41,895
# Now I have children of my own

1350
01:54:42,062 --> 01:54:46,901
# They ask their mother, What will I be?

1351
01:54:47,068 --> 01:54:52,532
# Will I be handsome? Will I be rich?

1352
01:54:52,699 --> 01:54:57,871
# I tell them tenderly

1353
01:54:57,996 --> 01:55:02,459
# Que sera, sera

1354
01:55:02,584 --> 01:55:06,880
# Whatever will be, will be

1355
01:55:07,005 --> 01:55:10,467
# The future's not ours to see

1356
01:55:10,593 --> 01:55:14,847
# Que sera, sera

1357
01:55:14,972 --> 01:55:19,477
# What will be, will be... #

1358
01:55:19,602 --> 01:55:23,148
You two wait in the mail room.
I'll bring him down.

1359
01:55:25,442 --> 01:55:27,778
Give me about five minutes.

1360
01:56:25,506 --> 01:56:26,799
No!

1361
01:56:29,844 --> 01:56:31,888
Oh, Daddy!

1362
01:56:33,932 --> 01:56:36,101
Take the boy. Go! But you must be quick!

1363
01:56:36,226 --> 01:56:38,228
Come on, son.

1364
01:56:42,691 --> 01:56:44,109
Don't touch him.

1365
01:56:49,281 --> 01:56:51,325
I don't think
you're going to do any shooting,

1366
01:56:51,492 --> 01:56:54,078
not with these people
downstairs and police outside.

1367
01:56:54,203 --> 01:56:57,623
You're not in a very happy
position yourself, you know.

1368
01:56:59,209 --> 01:57:03,338
- You've got to let the boy go!
- Precisely what I'm thinking.

1369
01:57:03,838 --> 01:57:08,093
Now I'm sure you're going to be sensible
and help me out of here.

1370
01:57:08,218 --> 01:57:11,054
Don't ask me for help, you miserable s-

1371
01:57:11,221 --> 01:57:14,433
You wouldn't want
your father to get hurt, would you, Hank?

1372
01:57:16,727 --> 01:57:20,189
Now we're going
to walk downstairs together, casually,

1373
01:57:20,356 --> 01:57:22,525
like three old friends.

1374
01:57:22,650 --> 01:57:26,863
Then we're going to take a stroll
as far as the nearest taxi rank.

1375
01:57:27,030 --> 01:57:30,492
I hope there won't be
any emotional scenes on the way down.

1376
01:57:30,659 --> 01:57:32,661
Do as he says, Hank.

1377
01:57:34,746 --> 01:57:37,291
No, the other way. The other way.

1378
01:57:37,416 --> 01:57:39,418
Shall we be going?

1379
01:57:39,585 --> 01:57:41,545
All right, start down the hall, son.

1380
01:57:44,173 --> 01:57:46,175
Don't say anything.

1381
01:59:15,104 --> 01:59:17,106
Hank!

1382
01:59:20,484 --> 01:59:22,445
Come on, Hank.

1383
01:59:28,701 --> 01:59:30,704
Oh, Mother!

1384
01:59:37,920 --> 01:59:41,423
I'm sorry we were gone so long,
but we go and pick up Hank.
