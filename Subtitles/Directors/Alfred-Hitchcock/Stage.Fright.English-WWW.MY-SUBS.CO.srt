1
00:01:08,226 --> 00:01:09,127
Any sign of the police?

2
00:01:09,193 --> 00:01:10,629
No, no sign.

3
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:11,462
Looks like we're
getting away with it.

4
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:12,797
Oh, good.

5
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,666
How far is it to
your father's boat?

6
00:01:14,733 --> 00:01:16,200
Two hours, with luck.

7
00:01:16,267 --> 00:01:18,503
Your luck seems to be
very good, touching wood.

8
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:19,970
Could you tell me now
what happened?

9
00:01:20,004 --> 00:01:22,507
I'd really like to know.
Only if you feel like it.

10
00:01:22,574 --> 00:01:24,943
It's Charlotte Inwood.

11
00:01:25,009 --> 00:01:26,210
She's in a jam.

12
00:01:26,277 --> 00:01:27,812
That doesn't surprise me.

13
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,814
No, this is serious,
Eve, it's deadly serious.

14
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:31,315
She was all over the place.

15
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:33,818
I had to help her.
Anybody would have done.

16
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:35,620
I was in my kitchen.
It was about 5:00.

17
00:01:35,687 --> 00:01:39,090
The doorbell rang. I went
downstairs to see who it was.

18
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:49,534
Jonnie, you love me.
Say that you love me.

19
00:01:49,601 --> 00:01:51,335
You do love me, don't you?

20
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:53,838
I think he's dead.
I'm sure he's dead.

21
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:56,541
I didn't mean it.
I didn't mean it.

22
00:01:56,608 --> 00:01:58,042
Who's dead?

23
00:01:58,109 --> 00:01:59,544
My husband.

24
00:01:59,611 --> 00:02:02,446
We had a terrible
quarrel... About you.

25
00:02:02,513 --> 00:02:03,848
Oh, he was vile.

26
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:06,551
You know the sort
of things he can say.

27
00:02:06,618 --> 00:02:09,554
He started to hit me.
I grabbed something.

28
00:02:09,621 --> 00:02:12,557
I was out of my mind with fear.

29
00:02:12,624 --> 00:02:14,292
Oh, what am I to do?

30
00:02:14,358 --> 00:02:15,369
Darling, pull yourself together.

31
00:02:15,393 --> 00:02:17,962
He may not be...

32
00:02:18,029 --> 00:02:21,532
The curtains, Jonnie.
Draw the curtains.

33
00:02:44,656 --> 00:02:47,091
I thought I had some Brandy.

34
00:02:47,158 --> 00:02:48,860
Here. Drink this.

35
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:56,968
He was an abominable man.

36
00:02:57,035 --> 00:02:59,570
Why do women marry
abominable men?

37
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:01,572
Where was all this?
My bedroom.

38
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,774
Anyone else in the house?

39
00:03:02,841 --> 00:03:04,609
I left the servants
in the country.

40
00:03:04,676 --> 00:03:06,878
I drove up early
to have an hour's rest

41
00:03:06,945 --> 00:03:08,112
before the performance.

42
00:03:08,179 --> 00:03:09,614
Oh, what shall I do?

43
00:03:09,681 --> 00:03:11,616
I can't go on.
I can't.

44
00:03:11,683 --> 00:03:12,917
Has anyone seen you?

45
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:14,218
No.
I don't think so.

46
00:03:14,285 --> 00:03:16,087
There wasn't a soul
in the street.

47
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:18,156
I jumped into my car
and came here.

48
00:03:18,222 --> 00:03:20,091
It's parked around the corner.

49
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,627
Oh, Jonnie, what
will they do to me?

50
00:03:22,694 --> 00:03:24,629
Don't tremble like that.
We'll find a way.

51
00:03:24,696 --> 00:03:25,973
We'll see you
all right, darling.

52
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:27,041
But you must call the theater.

53
00:03:27,065 --> 00:03:28,733
I can't play tonight.

54
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,502
Tell them I'm ill. Heavens,
it'll be true enough.

55
00:03:31,569 --> 00:03:33,938
You must go on tonight.
You've got to.

56
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:36,440
As if nothing had happened...
Nothing has happened.

57
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:38,485
You drove straight to the
theater, do you understand?

58
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:40,945
Straight to the theater.
You haven't been home at all.

59
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:43,214
Now get that into your head.

60
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:49,954
But my dress...
There's blood on it.

61
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:52,023
I must go back and change.

62
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:54,659
No, you can't do that.

63
00:03:54,726 --> 00:03:56,661
I could go myself.

64
00:03:56,728 --> 00:04:00,598
Oh, darling, could you?
There's no one there.

65
00:04:00,665 --> 00:04:02,667
I'd give you the key.

66
00:04:02,734 --> 00:04:04,468
There's a blue dress like this

67
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:07,171
in the big cupboard next to
my window in the bedroom.

68
00:04:07,238 --> 00:04:08,673
Here's the key.

69
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,250
Are you sure the
servants aren't back yet?

70
00:04:10,274 --> 00:04:12,977
No, but you must hurry.
Please, Jonnie, please.

71
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:14,979
This is my only chance.
You will, won't you?

72
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:17,982
It's a risk. Let me
think a minute. I mean...

73
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:20,952
You know I want
to help you, but...

74
00:04:22,754 --> 00:04:25,990
Go or don't go.
It's all the same.

75
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:28,693
I thought you loved me.

76
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,695
It doesn't matter now.

77
00:04:30,762 --> 00:04:33,431
Oh, my dear.
My darling.

78
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,205
I'd do anything for you.

79
00:04:41,272 --> 00:04:42,974
You know that.

80
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:47,979
I'll be as quick as I can.

81
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:56,200
It was your maid...
Nellie.

82
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:59,203
Oh, yes. She was
going to the house

83
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,206
to pick up some shoes
I need for the show.

84
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:03,908
Did she recognize you?

85
00:08:03,975 --> 00:08:05,209
I don't know.

86
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:07,211
You ought to get to the theater.

87
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:10,181
The police are bound to go
there to tell you the bad news.

88
00:08:10,248 --> 00:08:12,416
Give me my belt,
darling, will you?

89
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,223
Oh, Jonnie, what
have I done to you?

90
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,925
If Nellie recognized you,

91
00:08:20,992 --> 00:08:22,927
it won't be safe here.

92
00:08:22,994 --> 00:08:24,395
You ought to go away
for a while.

93
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,130
I don't think that
will do much good.

94
00:08:26,197 --> 00:08:28,532
But they'll come here.
You must go at once.

95
00:08:28,599 --> 00:08:31,169
Oh, my dearest darling,
you have saved me.

96
00:08:31,235 --> 00:08:33,071
We must think of you now.

97
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:35,506
You've got to hide.

98
00:08:38,542 --> 00:08:41,245
I don't care what happens to me.

99
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,214
Your job is to try
to forget everything.

100
00:08:43,281 --> 00:08:46,584
Let me do the worrying.
I'll find a way.

101
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:50,154
Then we'll start again,
won't we, you and I?

102
00:08:50,221 --> 00:08:53,958
No more stealth
and cheating and lying.

103
00:08:54,025 --> 00:08:56,227
I must hurry, darling.

104
00:08:56,294 --> 00:08:57,495
But I worry about you.

105
00:08:57,561 --> 00:08:59,063
Well, you mustn't.

106
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:01,199
You're an actress.
You're playing a part.

107
00:09:01,265 --> 00:09:02,933
No nerves when you're on.

108
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:04,235
I'll try.

109
00:09:07,805 --> 00:09:10,274
My dress!

110
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,709
I'll get rid of that.
Don't worry.

111
00:09:11,775 --> 00:09:13,011
Don't come down.

112
00:09:13,077 --> 00:09:14,712
We shouldn't be seen together.

113
00:09:14,778 --> 00:09:15,779
Au revoir, my darling.

114
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:17,181
Au revoir.

115
00:09:17,248 --> 00:09:20,251
And for heaven's sake,
don't worry.

116
00:10:44,502 --> 00:10:45,502
Yes?

117
00:10:45,536 --> 00:10:47,571
May I speak
to miss Eve Gill, please?

118
00:10:47,638 --> 00:10:50,608
Oh, dear, no.
I'm afraid she isn't in.

119
00:10:50,674 --> 00:10:52,343
She said she was
visiting her father,

120
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:54,011
but I thought she'd be back.

121
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:57,315
Yes. That's quite right.
She got back last night.

122
00:10:57,381 --> 00:10:59,117
She's had rehearsals
all day today

123
00:10:59,183 --> 00:11:01,952
at the royal academy
of dramatic art...

124
00:11:02,019 --> 00:11:04,222
You know, the R.A.D.A.

125
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:06,357
Do you know where she is now?

126
00:11:06,424 --> 00:11:08,326
Didn't you hear?

127
00:11:08,392 --> 00:11:12,563
She's at the R.A.D.A.
Rehearsing.

128
00:12:23,667 --> 00:12:24,602
Jonathan Cooper?

129
00:12:24,668 --> 00:12:25,403
Yes.

130
00:12:25,469 --> 00:12:27,104
We're police officers.

131
00:12:27,171 --> 00:12:29,106
May we see you for
a few minutes, please?

132
00:12:29,173 --> 00:12:30,674
Most certainly.
Please come in.

133
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,792
I can't possibly
accede to your request.

134
00:13:21,859 --> 00:13:23,794
I've come to this decision

135
00:13:23,861 --> 00:13:26,497
after giving the matter
my earnest consideration.

136
00:13:26,564 --> 00:13:29,300
Stop me if ever there was
such an ungrateful child!

137
00:13:29,367 --> 00:13:33,003
No, no, darling. Don't run
your words into one another.

138
00:13:48,419 --> 00:13:49,820
...most shamefully.

139
00:13:49,887 --> 00:13:54,525
Is it not in your memory
that we, too, years ago

140
00:13:54,592 --> 00:13:56,994
suffered the follies
and fevers of youth?

141
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,530
If our blood runs cooler
and more temperate,

142
00:13:59,597 --> 00:14:01,832
let us not account it
to ourselves for virtue,

143
00:14:01,899 --> 00:14:04,468
but place it to the credit
of the soothing balm

144
00:14:04,535 --> 00:14:06,103
of the passage of years

145
00:14:06,169 --> 00:14:07,438
that we have fortifications

146
00:14:07,505 --> 00:14:10,774
against the distempers
of juvenility.

147
00:14:10,841 --> 00:14:13,911
You were won't to be
kinder than this.

148
00:14:13,977 --> 00:14:15,045
No, papa, you are cruel.

149
00:14:15,112 --> 00:14:16,547
If all parents
were of your mind,

150
00:14:16,614 --> 00:14:18,048
marriage would be
an impossibility.

151
00:14:18,115 --> 00:14:19,317
And then what would become

152
00:14:19,383 --> 00:14:20,818
of the human race?

153
00:14:20,884 --> 00:14:22,596
Go away. What are
you doing here?

154
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,220
The police are after
me. Do you see them?

155
00:14:24,254 --> 00:14:27,358
You have not,
I hope, forgotten...

156
00:14:27,425 --> 00:14:28,859
They think I killed a man.

157
00:14:28,926 --> 00:14:30,461
Can you hide me on
your father's boat?

158
00:14:30,528 --> 00:14:32,463
Are you so heartless...

159
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:34,064
They've just gone.

160
00:14:34,131 --> 00:14:36,133
I was under the impression

161
00:14:36,199 --> 00:14:38,135
that this was a class
of intelligent students

162
00:14:38,201 --> 00:14:40,971
trying to master an extremely
difficult and beautiful art.

163
00:14:41,038 --> 00:14:43,641
I haven't the pleasure
of knowing you, young man,

164
00:14:43,707 --> 00:14:46,810
but I shall certainly report
your behavior to sir Kenneth.

165
00:14:46,877 --> 00:14:49,913
Now we will begin rehearsal
again, with the other cast.

166
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:53,584
This cast seems to think
acting is just fun and games.

167
00:14:53,651 --> 00:14:54,752
I'm terribly sorry.

168
00:14:54,818 --> 00:14:56,219
Oh, Jonathan.

169
00:14:56,286 --> 00:14:57,931
Let's get out of here.
Have you got your car here?

170
00:14:57,955 --> 00:14:58,889
It's parked in front.

171
00:14:58,956 --> 00:15:00,199
I'll show you
to the back entrance

172
00:15:00,223 --> 00:15:03,093
and pick you up there.

173
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,895
Eve, do you hate me

174
00:15:04,962 --> 00:15:07,898
now that you know
about Charlotte and me?

175
00:15:07,965 --> 00:15:10,901
Well, I could never
hate you, Jonathan,

176
00:15:10,968 --> 00:15:16,106
because we're...
We're such old friends,

177
00:15:16,173 --> 00:15:20,611
and... Well, just because.

178
00:15:20,678 --> 00:15:23,814
But I do wish I'd taken lessons

179
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:26,116
on the second fiddle.

180
00:15:26,183 --> 00:15:28,519
Good old Eve.

181
00:16:02,386 --> 00:16:06,924
Bring him in here.
It's warmer.

182
00:16:08,892 --> 00:16:12,029
Do you think
I behaved like a fool?

183
00:16:12,095 --> 00:16:14,031
On the whole, I think so.

184
00:16:14,097 --> 00:16:15,332
I think your boyfriend

185
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:17,034
has behaved like a fool.

186
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,836
I have a strong premonition

187
00:16:18,902 --> 00:16:21,038
that I'm going to
behave like a fool.

188
00:16:21,104 --> 00:16:22,339
It's infectious.

189
00:16:22,406 --> 00:16:24,174
Do you mean you're
going to help him?

190
00:16:24,241 --> 00:16:25,843
Well, why not?

191
00:16:25,909 --> 00:16:28,946
He's a friend of
yours, isn't he?

192
00:16:29,012 --> 00:16:29,847
Oh, yes.

193
00:16:29,913 --> 00:16:32,149
I see. More than a friend, eh?

194
00:16:32,215 --> 00:16:35,085
When I'm with him,
I get a feeling in here

195
00:16:35,152 --> 00:16:36,854
that... that's sort of...

196
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,732
Yes, yes, yes. Well, we'll
go into the symptoms later.

197
00:16:38,756 --> 00:16:41,124
Meanwhile, I take it
you're rather keen on him

198
00:16:41,191 --> 00:16:44,127
or still hungry.

199
00:16:44,194 --> 00:16:46,229
I'm in love with him.

200
00:16:49,567 --> 00:16:50,801
You've roped him,

201
00:16:50,868 --> 00:16:52,269
but he's not yet
broken to harness.

202
00:16:52,335 --> 00:16:55,639
Is that it?

203
00:16:55,706 --> 00:16:58,008
I wish Charlotte Inwood was in...

204
00:16:58,542 --> 00:17:00,544
Oh, do you?

205
00:17:00,611 --> 00:17:02,546
I've seen her on the stage.

206
00:17:02,613 --> 00:17:04,548
She'd have made me laugh,

207
00:17:04,615 --> 00:17:06,349
if I hadn't been
strictly on my guard.

208
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:08,519
She couldn't make me
laugh, off or on the stage.

209
00:17:08,586 --> 00:17:09,887
I can't bear to sit by

210
00:17:09,953 --> 00:17:11,364
and see what she's
doing to Jonathan.

211
00:17:11,388 --> 00:17:12,656
She's like an evil spirit.

212
00:17:12,723 --> 00:17:14,492
Just look at him!

213
00:17:14,558 --> 00:17:17,728
Ruined, and by a woman, hmm?

214
00:17:17,795 --> 00:17:21,298
Now you want me to take
the ruins for a little cruise.

215
00:17:21,364 --> 00:17:23,000
Well, is that it?

216
00:17:23,066 --> 00:17:24,535
Well, I thought
you could take him

217
00:17:24,602 --> 00:17:26,269
across the channel
or to the Irish coast.

218
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:27,638
Then he could hide out a bit.

219
00:17:27,705 --> 00:17:29,206
Well, the journey
sounds attractive,

220
00:17:29,272 --> 00:17:30,316
but less attractive to help

221
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,242
a suspected murderer to escape,

222
00:17:32,309 --> 00:17:33,911
particularly with my reputation.

223
00:17:33,977 --> 00:17:35,879
There's nothing the
matter with your reputation.

224
00:17:35,946 --> 00:17:38,949
No, indeed. I rather flattered
myself that there was.

225
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:41,852
As a matter of fact, the customs
people have their eye on me.

226
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,187
I'm suspected
of being a smuggler.

227
00:17:44,254 --> 00:17:45,122
Well, you're not.

228
00:17:45,188 --> 00:17:46,188
Oh, yes, I am.

229
00:17:46,223 --> 00:17:47,725
One cask of Brandy?

230
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:49,359
That doesn't mean
you're a smuggler.

231
00:17:49,426 --> 00:17:50,761
Two casks.

232
00:17:50,828 --> 00:17:52,930
That was 15 years ago.

233
00:17:52,996 --> 00:17:54,836
Ah, but I've done one or two
other things since

234
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:56,900
that I didn't tell
you or your mother about.

235
00:17:56,967 --> 00:17:58,769
It can't have been very much.

236
00:17:58,836 --> 00:18:01,204
Oh, of course not,
not very much.

237
00:18:01,271 --> 00:18:02,348
Nothing could appear very much

238
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:05,442
to a murderer's moll, hmm?

239
00:18:05,509 --> 00:18:07,277
But I never hope
to be appreciated.

240
00:18:07,344 --> 00:18:09,412
Yes, your mother
cured me of that.

241
00:18:09,479 --> 00:18:12,716
That's why I never could be
bothered with your mother.

242
00:18:12,783 --> 00:18:14,618
I appreciate you, father.

243
00:18:14,685 --> 00:18:18,188
You and captain Kidd
are my favorite heroes.

244
00:18:18,255 --> 00:18:20,924
My child, I am not deceived,

245
00:18:20,991 --> 00:18:23,627
and if there's one thing
I cannot bear,

246
00:18:23,694 --> 00:18:24,928
it's insincerity.

247
00:18:24,995 --> 00:18:26,930
Oh, but you've got to help him.

248
00:18:26,997 --> 00:18:28,599
You will help him, won't you?

249
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:31,001
He's lonely. He hasn't
got any friends but me

250
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,603
and maybe you.

251
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:33,837
You will help him, won't you?

252
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:37,507
He hasn't got me...
Yet.

253
00:18:39,376 --> 00:18:41,545
You're just dying
to get into a part of this,

254
00:18:41,612 --> 00:18:43,146
and you know you are.

255
00:18:43,213 --> 00:18:45,883
A part in this
melodramatic play, you mean?

256
00:18:45,949 --> 00:18:47,426
That's the way
you're treating it, Eve...

257
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:48,619
As though it were a play

258
00:18:48,686 --> 00:18:50,888
you were acting in
at the academy.

259
00:18:50,954 --> 00:18:53,023
Everything seems
a fine acting role

260
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:56,894
when you're stage-struck,
doesn't it, my dear?

261
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,330
Here you have a plot,
an interesting cast,

262
00:19:00,397 --> 00:19:04,401
even a costume,
little the worse for wear.

263
00:19:04,467 --> 00:19:08,271
Unfortunately, Eve,
in this real and earnest life,

264
00:19:08,338 --> 00:19:14,612
we must face the situation
and all its bearings. Yes.

265
00:19:14,678 --> 00:19:15,846
What do you mean?

266
00:19:15,913 --> 00:19:17,547
Well, miss Charlotte Inwood
appears to be

267
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:20,584
an expert in garden paths.

268
00:19:20,651 --> 00:19:22,219
I think she's led
your young friend

269
00:19:22,285 --> 00:19:23,654
up the garden path.

270
00:19:23,721 --> 00:19:26,123
I think we should hesitate
before we follow him.

271
00:19:26,189 --> 00:19:27,190
But why?

272
00:19:27,257 --> 00:19:28,568
Well, I don't know
how this bloodstain

273
00:19:28,592 --> 00:19:30,027
got onto this dress,

274
00:19:30,093 --> 00:19:32,596
but I do know that somebody
smeared it on deliberately.

275
00:19:32,663 --> 00:19:34,197
But why should they do that?

276
00:19:34,264 --> 00:19:37,935
Well, miss Inwood
is an actress, a very good one.

277
00:19:38,001 --> 00:19:40,270
She has an eye for
an emotional situation.

278
00:19:40,337 --> 00:19:42,272
Supposing she wanted our
somnolent young friend

279
00:19:42,339 --> 00:19:45,142
to go to her house
and be spotted there.

280
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:47,377
This sanguinary garment
would provide

281
00:19:47,444 --> 00:19:49,446
a very plausible reason,

282
00:19:49,512 --> 00:19:52,049
a very plausible reason indeed.

283
00:19:52,115 --> 00:19:53,951
So that's why she didn't
change her dress

284
00:19:54,017 --> 00:19:55,753
before she went to his rooms.

285
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:59,156
I cannot imagine miss Inwood
going to see her young man...

286
00:19:59,222 --> 00:20:01,000
Or your young man,
whosever young man he is...

287
00:20:01,024 --> 00:20:02,926
In this nasty, messy condition.

288
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:04,828
No. This dress
is a clue, my dear,

289
00:20:04,895 --> 00:20:06,830
a very important clue.

290
00:20:06,897 --> 00:20:08,074
And though it grieves
me, of all people,

291
00:20:08,098 --> 00:20:09,733
to have to say it, Eve,

292
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,202
I think we should
go to the police.

293
00:20:14,972 --> 00:20:16,907
Jonathan. Jonathan!
Jonathan, wake up.

294
00:20:16,974 --> 00:20:18,909
Jonathan, how far do you think

295
00:20:18,976 --> 00:20:20,610
you could trust Charlotte?

296
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:21,688
Why, I'd trust her with my life.

297
00:20:21,712 --> 00:20:23,546
What do you mean?

298
00:20:23,613 --> 00:20:25,759
This bloodstain didn't happen by
accident. It was put here deliberately.

299
00:20:25,783 --> 00:20:28,719
Don't be ridiculous. You're
trying to turn me against Charlotte,

300
00:20:28,786 --> 00:20:30,620
but you can't. What's
this doing here, anyhow?

301
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:31,998
It should have been
destroyed hours ago!

302
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:33,090
You fool!

303
00:20:33,156 --> 00:20:34,801
There goes evidence
that could have helped you.

304
00:20:34,825 --> 00:20:36,069
You're not to say things
against Charlotte.

305
00:20:36,093 --> 00:20:37,270
I'm doing all this for her sake.

306
00:20:37,294 --> 00:20:39,162
You're just jealous of her!

307
00:20:39,229 --> 00:20:41,140
Young man, I'd remind you
you're my daughter's guest.

308
00:20:41,164 --> 00:20:43,266
I'd like better manners
from you.

309
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:45,302
Oh, I am sorry, Eve.

310
00:20:45,368 --> 00:20:48,638
Please forgive me.

311
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:49,816
I lost my head for a moment.

312
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,941
I can hardly think.

313
00:20:51,008 --> 00:20:52,943
I'm almost dead
for want of sleep.

314
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:55,412
I wonder... would it be
too much trouble

315
00:20:55,478 --> 00:20:57,014
if I went to bed?

316
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:01,384
That is, if commodore Gill
wants to let me stay.

317
00:21:01,451 --> 00:21:03,921
Your room is at the head
of the stairs.

318
00:21:03,987 --> 00:21:05,622
You'll be quite comfortable.

319
00:21:05,689 --> 00:21:07,257
If you want anything
to read in bed,

320
00:21:07,324 --> 00:21:09,526
you'll find some quite good
murder mysteries in there.

321
00:21:09,592 --> 00:21:12,429
I beg your pardon.

322
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:19,235
Look, Eve...

323
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:21,237
But he...

324
00:21:45,062 --> 00:21:46,997
At last we are alone
and unobserved.

325
00:21:47,064 --> 00:21:48,999
You know, I'm beginning
to enjoy this.

326
00:21:49,066 --> 00:21:51,001
Father, do you think
she arranged

327
00:21:51,068 --> 00:21:53,003
to put the suspicion
on Jonathan?

328
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:55,005
Do you think she
deliberately framed him?

329
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,774
The thought had crossed my mind.

330
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,275
That was why
I reluctantly suggested

331
00:21:58,341 --> 00:22:00,353
that our friends the police
ought to be told about it.

332
00:22:00,377 --> 00:22:01,478
But it's too late now.

333
00:22:01,544 --> 00:22:03,256
Our only piece of evidence
has gone up the chimney.

334
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,681
But we must help Jonathan.

335
00:22:04,748 --> 00:22:06,149
He'll do nothing for himself.

336
00:22:06,216 --> 00:22:07,761
He's hopelessly in love
with that woman.

337
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:10,520
It's up to us.

338
00:22:10,587 --> 00:22:13,523
Yes, but it...
It won't be easy.

339
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:16,559
It is easy. I'll go to
her and see her myself.

340
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:18,028
Would that be wise?

341
00:22:18,095 --> 00:22:19,897
I don't care whether
it's wise or not.

342
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:21,174
I'll tell her we know
about the dress

343
00:22:21,198 --> 00:22:22,441
and how the bloodstain got there

344
00:22:22,465 --> 00:22:24,534
and we know every move
of her game.

345
00:22:24,601 --> 00:22:27,805
I'll make her talk. It'll be
one woman to another.

346
00:22:27,871 --> 00:22:29,272
An impressive situation
at any time.

347
00:22:29,339 --> 00:22:31,008
She'll give herself away.

348
00:22:31,074 --> 00:22:32,776
She won't be able to
help it. You'll see.

349
00:22:32,843 --> 00:22:34,577
I won't see.
I won't be there,

350
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:35,712
and neither will you.

351
00:22:35,779 --> 00:22:37,056
If we're right in what we think,

352
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,760
she's a desperate woman,
a dangerous woman.

353
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:40,017
She won't give herself away.

354
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:41,560
You'd be giving her
another alternative.

355
00:22:41,584 --> 00:22:44,587
She has no alternative.

356
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:47,224
She might murder you.

357
00:22:48,358 --> 00:22:51,761
Oh, don't be so
melodramatic, father.

358
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:53,763
Look, my love.
Face facts.

359
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:56,766
What is the least
that can happen to you

360
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:58,568
if you tackle
this remarkable lady?

361
00:22:58,635 --> 00:23:01,271
She'll at once pick up
a little pink telephone

362
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:02,772
and call the police.

363
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,074
She'll then give you in charge

364
00:23:04,141 --> 00:23:06,043
for concealing
a fugitive from justice.

365
00:23:06,109 --> 00:23:09,446
Eventually, you will be
tried at the old Bailey.

366
00:23:09,512 --> 00:23:11,314
Well, if you're lucky,
you might get off with,

367
00:23:11,381 --> 00:23:15,152
now, let me see...
A couple of years,

368
00:23:15,218 --> 00:23:17,054
which you will spend
in Holloway prison,

369
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:21,658
meditating on the folly of
transmuting melodrama into real life.

370
00:23:21,724 --> 00:23:23,093
Well...

371
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:26,096
You see, the best thing
you can do, my girl,

372
00:23:26,163 --> 00:23:28,098
is to go back to your academy

373
00:23:28,165 --> 00:23:30,600
and practice
your soul-shaking antics

374
00:23:30,667 --> 00:23:33,070
in surroundings where
they can't do any harm.

375
00:23:33,136 --> 00:23:34,972
After all, this fellow
can't possibly

376
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:38,308
mean all that to you.

377
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,377
But he does, father.

378
00:25:22,345 --> 00:25:23,213
Move along there, please.

379
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,447
But I'd like to...

380
00:25:24,514 --> 00:25:27,184
Move on, miss.
There's nothing to see.

381
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:33,523
Hello, father.

382
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:36,793
I'm... I'm outside
the Inwood house.

383
00:25:36,859 --> 00:25:39,062
Outside? Well,
why not inside?

384
00:25:39,129 --> 00:25:40,530
Oh, don't be ridiculous, father.

385
00:25:40,597 --> 00:25:42,365
The police won't let
anyone near the place.

386
00:25:42,432 --> 00:25:44,534
Really? How very extraordinary.

387
00:25:44,601 --> 00:25:46,536
Well, look, you've
done your best now.

388
00:25:46,603 --> 00:25:48,538
Come back here
and decide what to do

389
00:25:48,605 --> 00:25:50,940
about the man
that came to dinner.

390
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:52,542
Oh, I feel awful.

391
00:25:52,609 --> 00:25:55,245
I've been listening to the
people in the crowd talking,

392
00:25:55,312 --> 00:25:58,248
and they assume
that you-know-who is guilty

393
00:25:58,315 --> 00:26:00,617
and all the police
have to do is catch him.

394
00:26:00,683 --> 00:26:02,152
It's terrifying.

395
00:26:02,219 --> 00:26:04,254
Yes, but the police may
not think he's guilty.

396
00:26:04,321 --> 00:26:06,256
After all, they work
in secret, you know.

397
00:26:06,323 --> 00:26:08,258
They may have their own ideas

398
00:26:08,325 --> 00:26:09,892
about a certain lady.

399
00:26:09,959 --> 00:26:12,495
I wish I knew what
the police were thinking.

400
00:26:12,562 --> 00:26:15,165
Well, look, why not ask them?

401
00:26:15,232 --> 00:26:18,268
Well, that's easier
said than done.

402
00:26:18,335 --> 00:26:20,503
Oh, just a minute, father.

403
00:26:21,971 --> 00:26:23,906
Father, good-bye, now.

404
00:26:23,973 --> 00:26:25,575
Eve...

405
00:26:32,115 --> 00:26:35,552
I'll see you back at the
office about 2:00, sir.

406
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,836
May I have
a small Brandy, please?

407
00:27:26,903 --> 00:27:28,538
Madam.

408
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:29,839
Pardon my intrusion,

409
00:27:29,906 --> 00:27:31,341
but is there, by any chance,

410
00:27:31,408 --> 00:27:33,143
any assistance I could be of?

411
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:34,711
No, thank you.

412
00:27:42,419 --> 00:27:44,854
I don't know how you
pick up all the dirt.

413
00:27:44,921 --> 00:27:46,689
Oh, I get around.

414
00:27:53,263 --> 00:27:55,632
Right from the horse's mouth.

415
00:28:00,403 --> 00:28:03,306
I most solemnly
assure you, madam,

416
00:28:03,373 --> 00:28:05,375
it would be a pleasure
if there was

417
00:28:05,442 --> 00:28:07,277
any assistance I could be of.

418
00:28:07,344 --> 00:28:08,578
Thank you very much.

419
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:11,348
Oh... If you will
allow me to say so,

420
00:28:11,414 --> 00:28:13,283
you do look depressed.

421
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:17,254
Yes... the cheering word,
the helping hand...

422
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,622
I'm perfectly all right.

423
00:28:19,689 --> 00:28:24,161
Oh... Oh, good. Good.

424
00:28:35,472 --> 00:28:37,407
Is there anything
I can do?

425
00:28:37,474 --> 00:28:39,409
Look, I don't know your trouble,

426
00:28:39,476 --> 00:28:41,544
but you don't look
very well to me.

427
00:28:41,611 --> 00:28:43,746
A little Brandy
can't do you any harm.

428
00:28:43,813 --> 00:28:45,682
Why not drink it?

429
00:28:54,157 --> 00:28:56,092
My great-aunt died
over a glass of Brandy,

430
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:58,261
but it was her 15th that day.

431
00:28:58,328 --> 00:29:00,530
Feeling any better?
Yes, thank you.

432
00:29:00,597 --> 00:29:01,964
You left your lunch over there.

433
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:03,666
Oh, it won't feel lonely.

434
00:29:03,733 --> 00:29:05,168
I'll go back to it in a minute.

435
00:29:05,235 --> 00:29:06,603
Perhaps you're allergic to bars.

436
00:29:06,669 --> 00:29:08,305
Look, would you feel less uneasy

437
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:09,772
if I sat with you...
Or more uneasy?

438
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:11,550
Perhaps you're allergic
to strange men, too.

439
00:29:11,574 --> 00:29:13,042
No. I love strange men...

440
00:29:13,109 --> 00:29:14,644
I mean, I'm very fond of them.

441
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:18,681
Oh... I'll just go
and get my lunch.

442
00:29:18,748 --> 00:29:20,016
The Butler told me.

443
00:29:20,082 --> 00:29:21,684
Never saw such a sight.

444
00:29:21,751 --> 00:29:23,529
They say his head was
bashed in something terrible.

445
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:25,121
I heard they clocked him so hard

446
00:29:25,188 --> 00:29:26,665
that his false teeth went
right across the room.

447
00:29:26,689 --> 00:29:28,458
I know I'm pretty silly,

448
00:29:28,525 --> 00:29:31,093
but I overheard two
people on the street today

449
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,729
talking about the murder.

450
00:29:32,795 --> 00:29:34,531
They went into a lot of detail.

451
00:29:34,597 --> 00:29:36,032
I felt so sick and giddy

452
00:29:36,098 --> 00:29:37,734
I just had to come in

453
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,868
and have a Brandy.

454
00:29:38,935 --> 00:29:40,503
My father says I tend

455
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:42,004
to overdramatize everything.

456
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:43,506
I expect he's right.

457
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:44,874
I know how you feel, though.

458
00:29:44,941 --> 00:29:46,509
I hate violence, myself.

459
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:49,178
Doesn't that make it
rather difficult for you?

460
00:29:49,246 --> 00:29:51,180
I mean, I think
we ought to face up

461
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:53,350
to the ugly side of life.

462
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:54,784
Now, me, for instance...

463
00:29:54,851 --> 00:29:56,152
I'm an actress.

464
00:29:56,219 --> 00:29:59,021
I ought to face up to
all sorts of experiences,

465
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:00,857
oughtn't I?

466
00:30:00,923 --> 00:30:02,158
Oh, I don't know.

467
00:30:02,225 --> 00:30:03,760
Supposing I happened
to be a librarian.

468
00:30:03,826 --> 00:30:06,062
A librarian doesn't have
to encounter much violence

469
00:30:06,128 --> 00:30:08,665
except an occasional
encyclopedia falling on his head.

470
00:30:08,731 --> 00:30:10,132
But you're not a librarian,

471
00:30:10,199 --> 00:30:11,968
are you?

472
00:30:12,034 --> 00:30:13,470
No, I'm not.
How do you know?

473
00:30:13,536 --> 00:30:15,305
Well, you just don't look

474
00:30:15,372 --> 00:30:16,973
like a librarian.

475
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,108
You don't look like an actress.

476
00:30:19,175 --> 00:30:21,744
Oh? I thought I did.

477
00:30:24,681 --> 00:30:26,583
Well, I'm only
a beginner, really.

478
00:30:26,649 --> 00:30:28,485
That is, I've only
played one part in public.

479
00:30:28,551 --> 00:30:30,320
Could I have seen you?

480
00:30:30,387 --> 00:30:31,621
I don't think so.

481
00:30:31,688 --> 00:30:33,290
It was in the church hall.

482
00:30:33,356 --> 00:30:35,658
I played the fourth deadly sin.

483
00:30:37,059 --> 00:30:38,295
Were you good?

484
00:30:38,361 --> 00:30:40,297
I was pretty deadly.

485
00:30:40,363 --> 00:30:41,998
What was this
Jonathan Cooper after?

486
00:30:42,064 --> 00:30:43,366
I heard there was
nothing stolen.

487
00:30:43,433 --> 00:30:45,835
Perhaps he did it
for the fun of it.

488
00:30:45,902 --> 00:30:47,136
Poor Charlotte Inwood.

489
00:30:47,203 --> 00:30:49,071
Imagine coming home and finding

490
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:50,640
your husband horribly dead,

491
00:30:50,707 --> 00:30:52,675
policemen and detectives
all over the house,

492
00:30:52,742 --> 00:30:53,976
and the blood.

493
00:30:54,043 --> 00:30:55,478
Careful. Careful.
Careful.

494
00:30:55,545 --> 00:30:56,979
Remember, you're sensitive

495
00:30:57,046 --> 00:30:58,615
to that sort of thing.

496
00:30:58,681 --> 00:30:59,958
You'll bring on
another fainting fit.

497
00:30:59,982 --> 00:31:01,384
I hear that Charlotte Inwood's

498
00:31:01,451 --> 00:31:02,251
going back into the show

499
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:03,886
in a couple of days.

500
00:31:03,953 --> 00:31:05,655
Must be dreadful
to sing and dance

501
00:31:05,722 --> 00:31:07,357
and be gay with that
horrible picture

502
00:31:07,424 --> 00:31:08,658
still burning in one's mind.

503
00:31:08,725 --> 00:31:10,493
Oh, it's the old story,

504
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:13,463
"is not the actor the man
with a heart?" All over again.

505
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:15,732
I once had a cousin
who had a duodenal ulcer

506
00:31:15,798 --> 00:31:18,000
and an extremely funny face
both at the same time.

507
00:31:18,067 --> 00:31:19,469
Everybody laughed at him

508
00:31:19,536 --> 00:31:20,970
when he was telling
his symptoms.

509
00:31:21,037 --> 00:31:22,472
His name was Jim.

510
00:31:22,539 --> 00:31:24,106
That must have been terrible.

511
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:25,608
Oh, I don't know.

512
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:27,577
Jim's quite a common name.

513
00:31:29,245 --> 00:31:31,013
I wonder what Charlotte Inwood

514
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,360
is really like...
Really, I mean.

515
00:31:32,415 --> 00:31:33,816
Oh, hello, Nellie.

516
00:31:33,883 --> 00:31:36,052
That's Charlotte
Inwood's maid.

517
00:31:40,957 --> 00:31:41,958
Hello, Nellie.

518
00:31:42,024 --> 00:31:43,760
I didn't expect to
see you so soon.

519
00:31:43,826 --> 00:31:46,195
How are you bearing
up, ducks, after last night?

520
00:31:46,262 --> 00:31:47,897
Mrs. tippet,
what I've been through...

521
00:31:47,964 --> 00:31:48,998
All those policemen.

522
00:31:49,065 --> 00:31:50,767
Bothering you with
a lot of questions,

523
00:31:50,833 --> 00:31:51,834
I suppose.

524
00:31:51,901 --> 00:31:53,470
Questions? They've been
asking me this,

525
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:54,837
asking me that all morning long.

526
00:31:54,904 --> 00:31:56,624
I didn't know whether
I was coming or going.

527
00:31:56,673 --> 00:31:58,808
Gin and lemon, please,
Mrs. tippet.

528
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:00,810
Not too much lemon, dear.
O.K.

529
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:02,912
Mind you, they never
laid a finger on me,

530
00:32:02,979 --> 00:32:04,213
but, oh, the questions.

531
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,715
Nag, nag, nag.

532
00:32:05,782 --> 00:32:07,216
"How did you know
it was Mr. Cooper?

533
00:32:07,283 --> 00:32:09,185
"How many times
you seen him and where?

534
00:32:09,251 --> 00:32:10,753
And did he give you anything?"

535
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,389
Blimey, he never
gave me nothing.

536
00:32:12,455 --> 00:32:14,557
"And how long you been
miss Inwood's maid?"

537
00:32:14,624 --> 00:32:16,893
Oh, they was gentlemanly
and polite, all right,

538
00:32:16,959 --> 00:32:19,862
but give me the bleeding
Russians any day, dear.

539
00:32:19,929 --> 00:32:21,664
Yes. You got to watch your step

540
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:22,841
when you're up
against the police.

541
00:32:22,865 --> 00:32:24,066
And if that wasn't enough,

542
00:32:24,133 --> 00:32:25,402
when I came out of the house,

543
00:32:25,468 --> 00:32:26,836
the reporters pounced on me

544
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:28,738
with their questions,
asking me the low-down.

545
00:32:28,805 --> 00:32:30,339
I just jumped out of my skin

546
00:32:30,407 --> 00:32:31,884
when that photographer's
flash bulb went.

547
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:35,678
Well, I mean,
fancy taking my picture.

548
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:36,955
You're quite a
celebrity, you lucky girl.

549
00:32:36,979 --> 00:32:37,847
I'll have to buy

550
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:39,416
the daily mirror tomorrow.

551
00:32:39,482 --> 00:32:41,584
Of course, I'm not saying a word

552
00:32:41,651 --> 00:32:43,786
to the reporters... not a word.

553
00:32:43,853 --> 00:32:47,590
After all,
who discovered the body?

554
00:32:47,657 --> 00:32:49,258
I'll be a star witness
at that trial,

555
00:32:49,325 --> 00:32:51,428
and my story ought to be
worth something,

556
00:32:51,494 --> 00:32:53,863
and I've no intention
of giving it away.

557
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,498
Isn't she talking too much?

558
00:32:55,565 --> 00:32:59,969
Too much, too loud,
too everything.

559
00:33:00,036 --> 00:33:01,804
How do you feel now?

560
00:33:01,871 --> 00:33:04,040
Oh, I feel a little better,

561
00:33:04,106 --> 00:33:05,442
thank you.

562
00:33:05,508 --> 00:33:06,943
I have to go.

563
00:33:07,009 --> 00:33:08,545
I don't like
leaving you here alone.

564
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:10,547
Do you feel fit enough
to let me see you home?

565
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:11,914
I have a car.

566
00:33:11,981 --> 00:33:14,083
Perhaps you'd better
let me drive it for you.

567
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:16,285
Well, that's very kind of you.

568
00:33:16,352 --> 00:33:18,087
I do still feel a bit wobbly.

569
00:33:18,154 --> 00:33:19,589
To be quite honest,

570
00:33:19,656 --> 00:33:20,933
it isn't really kindness at all.

571
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:22,559
I mean, I'm afraid
I maneuvered it.

572
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:24,661
How clever of you.

573
00:33:24,727 --> 00:33:26,663
You've got something
there, Fred.

574
00:33:26,729 --> 00:33:28,130
I'll drink to that on you.

575
00:33:28,197 --> 00:33:30,833
A double gin and lemon, please.

576
00:33:31,701 --> 00:33:33,102
Double?

577
00:33:33,169 --> 00:33:34,871
All right, Nellie, I
hope it chokes you.

578
00:33:34,937 --> 00:33:36,606
You don't miss a trick, do you?

579
00:33:36,673 --> 00:33:38,541
You're always on the make.

580
00:33:49,552 --> 00:33:50,920
My mother's really a dear...

581
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:52,655
My father, too, of course,

582
00:33:52,722 --> 00:33:53,866
but they shout at one another,

583
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:55,458
and neither one like to shout.

584
00:33:55,525 --> 00:33:57,002
I can't tell you how
much I appreciate this.

585
00:33:57,026 --> 00:33:58,995
You've been
extraordinarily kind,

586
00:33:59,061 --> 00:34:00,897
and you know nothing
whatsoever about me.

587
00:34:00,963 --> 00:34:02,932
Oh, I don't know, miss Gill.

588
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,634
You were born in South Africa...

589
00:34:04,701 --> 00:34:06,302
The 17th of September,
wasn't it?

590
00:34:06,368 --> 00:34:08,004
You were educated in America,

591
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:10,048
and now you're studying at the
royal academy of dramatic art.

592
00:34:10,072 --> 00:34:11,974
Your mother and father
don't live together.

593
00:34:12,041 --> 00:34:13,952
You were a very well-behaved
young lady until today,

594
00:34:13,976 --> 00:34:15,176
but you're allergic to murder,

595
00:34:15,211 --> 00:34:16,254
and that drove you to drink.

596
00:34:16,278 --> 00:34:17,480
I hope it's only temporary.

597
00:34:17,547 --> 00:34:19,949
But I don't even know your name.

598
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:22,018
I only know that you
play the piano.

599
00:34:22,084 --> 00:34:23,853
I'm so sorry.
It was stupid of me.

600
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,022
I forgot.
My name is Smith.

601
00:34:26,088 --> 00:34:28,825
Just ordinary Smith?

602
00:34:38,434 --> 00:34:40,136
A detective?

603
00:34:40,202 --> 00:34:42,404
I hope you don't mind.

604
00:34:42,471 --> 00:34:45,241
Oh, no.
Of course not.

605
00:34:45,307 --> 00:34:46,943
Oh, I'm delighted.

606
00:34:47,009 --> 00:34:48,044
By the way,

607
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:49,746
I don't suppose
you and your mother

608
00:34:49,812 --> 00:34:52,582
are interested in tea...
With a detective, that is.

609
00:34:52,649 --> 00:34:53,883
Of course...

610
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:56,018
Especially with a detective.

611
00:34:56,085 --> 00:34:57,596
Would you like to have
tea with us one day?

612
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:59,131
Oh, I'd love to.
How about this afternoon?

613
00:34:59,155 --> 00:35:01,390
Well, tomorrow, then?

614
00:35:01,457 --> 00:35:03,192
Yes.

615
00:35:03,259 --> 00:35:05,562
Yes. That's fine.

616
00:35:28,484 --> 00:35:30,920
And I could take your place.

617
00:35:30,987 --> 00:35:32,589
You'd never get away with it.

618
00:35:32,655 --> 00:35:34,591
What makes you think
you could be a maid?

619
00:35:34,657 --> 00:35:37,727
But it would only be
for a day or two.

620
00:35:37,794 --> 00:35:38,837
You'd have to be her dresser
down at the theater, too.

621
00:35:38,861 --> 00:35:39,996
You couldn't do that.

622
00:35:40,062 --> 00:35:41,831
That's very highly skilled work.

623
00:35:41,898 --> 00:35:43,499
Well, I could
if you told me how.

624
00:35:43,566 --> 00:35:45,134
It sounds phony to me...

625
00:35:45,201 --> 00:35:46,636
All this trouble

626
00:35:46,703 --> 00:35:47,937
just to get a newspaper story.

627
00:35:48,004 --> 00:35:49,606
Well, we women
reporters have a tough job

628
00:35:49,672 --> 00:35:51,107
competing with the men...

629
00:35:51,173 --> 00:35:53,442
Especially on important
stories like this.

630
00:35:53,509 --> 00:35:55,778
And what paper
are you on, may I ask?

631
00:35:55,845 --> 00:35:57,614
Well, I can't tell you that.

632
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,181
If anything should go wrong

633
00:35:59,248 --> 00:36:00,750
with my plan,

634
00:36:00,817 --> 00:36:02,294
it would be very
embarrassing for the paper.

635
00:36:02,318 --> 00:36:03,753
Oh? And what about my job?

636
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,387
Suppose miss Inwood found out

637
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:07,056
I was passing you off
as my cousin.

638
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:08,958
I'm not sure
she won't smell a rat.

639
00:36:09,025 --> 00:36:10,793
I never been away ill for years.

640
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,228
But anyone could go sick,

641
00:36:12,294 --> 00:36:14,296
and I could do it...
Really, I could.

642
00:36:14,363 --> 00:36:15,598
I've...

643
00:36:15,665 --> 00:36:17,299
I've done a bit of acting.

644
00:36:17,366 --> 00:36:19,268
Character acting?

645
00:36:19,335 --> 00:36:20,569
Yes.

646
00:36:20,637 --> 00:36:22,038
I see. All you've got to do

647
00:36:22,104 --> 00:36:23,481
is to put on some
of your old clothes

648
00:36:23,505 --> 00:36:24,583
and make yourself look common

649
00:36:24,607 --> 00:36:25,875
like me.

650
00:36:25,942 --> 00:36:27,319
Let me explain why
it's so important

651
00:36:27,343 --> 00:36:28,911
that I get the
right slant on this.

652
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:30,479
I think there's a romance

653
00:36:30,546 --> 00:36:32,414
between miss Inwood and
this man named Cooper.

654
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:33,759
And where did you get this idea?

655
00:36:33,783 --> 00:36:35,184
Do you know what I think?

656
00:36:35,251 --> 00:36:36,853
I think you're snooping
for the police.

657
00:36:36,919 --> 00:36:37,920
Oh, no!

658
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,555
I saw you this morning

659
00:36:39,622 --> 00:36:41,457
sitting on this very
seat with a detective.

660
00:36:41,523 --> 00:36:45,795
Oh, well, that was
Wilfred Smith.

661
00:36:45,862 --> 00:36:47,129
He's an old friend of mine.

662
00:36:47,196 --> 00:36:49,231
I didn't get a thing out of him.

663
00:36:49,298 --> 00:36:50,232
Charlie.

664
00:36:50,299 --> 00:36:51,644
Double gin
and lemon, please.

665
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:53,235
Not too much lemon, dear.

666
00:36:53,302 --> 00:36:54,804
Same for me.

667
00:36:55,938 --> 00:36:57,473
I can get five times that much

668
00:36:57,539 --> 00:36:59,642
from any newspaper
when the case is over.

669
00:36:59,709 --> 00:37:01,678
Why not get both?

670
00:37:01,744 --> 00:37:03,179
Caught you, have I?

671
00:37:03,245 --> 00:37:07,216
Hope I don't intrude
on some deep conspiracy,

672
00:37:07,283 --> 00:37:09,886
and I hope
you find yourself no worse

673
00:37:09,952 --> 00:37:12,088
for your
distressing experiences.

674
00:37:12,154 --> 00:37:15,124
Haven't I met
your charming friend before?

675
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:16,759
I know that face.

676
00:37:16,826 --> 00:37:20,462
This is my cousin Doris,
Mr. Fortesque.

677
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:23,532
Oh, yeah.
Charming. Charming.

678
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:27,970
Perhaps as dear Nellie didn't
provide me with your surname,

679
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:30,372
you'll let me call you Doris,
eh? Yeah.

680
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,667
Mrs. Mason,

681
00:39:05,734 --> 00:39:07,203
I can't think what I've done

682
00:39:07,269 --> 00:39:08,838
with my reading glasses.

683
00:39:08,905 --> 00:39:11,207
Have you seen them anywhere?

684
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:36,598
Could I...

685
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:38,000
Oh, there you are.

686
00:39:38,067 --> 00:39:39,735
Help me find my glasses,
Eve darling.

687
00:39:39,802 --> 00:39:42,004
I can't see a thing.

688
00:39:46,475 --> 00:39:51,313
I'm Doris Tinsdale.
I'm from Nellie.

689
00:40:03,392 --> 00:40:05,094
Move along there, please.

690
00:40:10,166 --> 00:40:11,800
I'm Doris Tinsdale.

691
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:13,335
Miss Inwood's expecting me.

692
00:40:13,402 --> 00:40:14,536
Oh, yes.

693
00:40:14,603 --> 00:40:17,373
You're the temporary
Nellie sent along.

694
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:27,316
Just wait over here a minute.

695
00:40:34,356 --> 00:40:36,158
We'd like to see miss Inwood.

696
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:37,669
Can I have a few
words with you as well?

697
00:40:37,693 --> 00:40:40,462
By all means. Will you
step this way, please?

698
00:40:40,529 --> 00:40:42,965
I understand you've
been in service

699
00:40:43,032 --> 00:40:45,968
for six years and five months.

700
00:40:47,904 --> 00:40:49,872
Come in.

701
00:40:49,939 --> 00:40:52,041
O.K., yes.

702
00:40:52,108 --> 00:40:55,844
I'll come around
the box office tonight.

703
00:40:55,912 --> 00:40:57,479
What did they say,
Freddie?

704
00:40:57,546 --> 00:40:59,115
More cancellations.

705
00:40:59,181 --> 00:41:00,950
Oh, how stupid people are.

706
00:41:01,017 --> 00:41:02,618
Even if my understudy's legs

707
00:41:02,684 --> 00:41:03,920
are so peculiar,

708
00:41:03,986 --> 00:41:05,487
she's just as good as I am.

709
00:41:05,554 --> 00:41:07,689
She knows darn well
she'd better not be.

710
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:08,991
That's not the point.

711
00:41:09,058 --> 00:41:12,194
It's you they want to see.

712
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:13,538
Well, what do you want?

713
00:41:13,562 --> 00:41:16,832
I'm from Nellie.
Madam's expecting me.

714
00:41:16,899 --> 00:41:18,968
The new girl's here, Charlie.

715
00:41:29,912 --> 00:41:32,081
No. No.
This doesn't fit me.

716
00:41:33,916 --> 00:41:36,018
Here. Here. Pull it
up on this side.

717
00:41:36,085 --> 00:41:38,020
The other side, too.

718
00:41:38,087 --> 00:41:40,022
You know that, don't you?

719
00:41:41,623 --> 00:41:43,492
Excuse me, madam.

720
00:41:43,559 --> 00:41:45,327
Read it to me, dear.

721
00:41:51,567 --> 00:41:53,135
"Dear madam,

722
00:41:53,202 --> 00:41:54,479
"this will introduce
my cousin Doris,

723
00:41:54,503 --> 00:41:56,438
who is in every way
a good girl."

724
00:41:56,505 --> 00:41:58,540
Not so loud.

725
00:41:58,607 --> 00:42:01,110
"I hope you'll find her
satisfactory during my illness.

726
00:42:01,177 --> 00:42:02,578
Signed,
Nellie Goode."

727
00:42:02,644 --> 00:42:03,779
This is very nice,

728
00:42:03,845 --> 00:42:05,948
if you can call mourning nice,

729
00:42:06,015 --> 00:42:08,217
but... Isn't there some way

730
00:42:08,284 --> 00:42:11,453
we could let it plunge
a little in front?

731
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,754
I suppose not.

732
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:14,356
"Signed, Nellie Goode."

733
00:42:14,423 --> 00:42:17,859
If we could only work in
a little color somewhere.

734
00:42:17,926 --> 00:42:18,927
Oh, well.

735
00:42:18,995 --> 00:42:21,663
"Signed, Nellie Goode."

736
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:23,132
Take off your hat, dear.

737
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:24,839
There are simply
millions of things to do,

738
00:42:24,866 --> 00:42:26,368
I'm afraid.

739
00:42:26,435 --> 00:42:29,005
You won't mind if
I depend on you a great deal?

740
00:42:29,071 --> 00:42:30,472
Thank you, darling.

741
00:42:30,539 --> 00:42:32,374
Now, get me out of these weeds.

742
00:42:32,441 --> 00:42:34,576
I'm beginning to feel sad,
and I shouldn't feel sad.

743
00:42:34,643 --> 00:42:36,412
It's so depressing.

744
00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:39,615
See who that is.

745
00:42:39,681 --> 00:42:41,183
What's your name?

746
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:43,152
Doris Tinsdale, madam.

747
00:42:52,328 --> 00:42:54,130
Yes? What is it,
groves?

748
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:55,473
Divisional detective
inspector Byard

749
00:42:55,497 --> 00:42:57,133
and detective inspector Smith

750
00:42:57,199 --> 00:42:58,800
to see you, madam.

751
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:00,236
Good heavens!

752
00:43:00,302 --> 00:43:02,738
Hear that, Freddie?
The police again.

753
00:43:02,804 --> 00:43:03,705
Show them up, groves.

754
00:43:03,772 --> 00:43:05,341
Very good, madam.

755
00:43:05,407 --> 00:43:06,242
I thought I told you

756
00:43:06,308 --> 00:43:08,777
to wait downstairs.

757
00:43:08,844 --> 00:43:11,413
Hand me a negligee
from that cupboard over there,

758
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:13,882
will you, Phyllis?

759
00:43:13,949 --> 00:43:15,117
Now what about this dress

760
00:43:15,184 --> 00:43:16,585
for the theatrical garden party,

761
00:43:16,652 --> 00:43:19,288
miss Inwood?

762
00:43:19,362 --> 00:43:21,130
Black? Oh, yes, of course.

763
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:22,958
How clever of you

764
00:43:23,025 --> 00:43:24,460
to remember, darling.

765
00:43:24,526 --> 00:43:27,029
Hold that for me, will you?

766
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:29,765
Freddie.

767
00:43:29,831 --> 00:43:30,899
Yes?

768
00:43:30,966 --> 00:43:32,201
We haven't decided.

769
00:43:32,268 --> 00:43:34,170
Am I going to
the theatrical garden party?

770
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:36,172
I don't feel an atom like it.

771
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:38,274
I keep thinking about
those dreadful cancellations.

772
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:39,908
I don't see why.

773
00:43:39,975 --> 00:43:41,343
They're a compliment to you.

774
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:42,478
Hand me a comb and mirror

775
00:43:42,544 --> 00:43:44,012
from over there, will you?

776
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,548
But they do cut down
the takings.

777
00:43:46,615 --> 00:43:48,484
I think I could appear tonight

778
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:50,486
if you insisted.

779
00:43:50,552 --> 00:43:52,188
It would be
a terrible strain

780
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:53,689
for you, wouldn't it?

781
00:43:53,755 --> 00:43:55,191
Oh, ghastly.

782
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:57,326
But I can't help feel

783
00:43:57,393 --> 00:44:00,196
for my poor, dear,
loyal public...

784
00:44:00,262 --> 00:44:02,331
Looking towards it for weeks

785
00:44:02,398 --> 00:44:06,034
and then trailing back sadly
with their tickets...

786
00:44:06,102 --> 00:44:08,170
Getting their money returned.

787
00:44:08,237 --> 00:44:09,405
I simply can't bear it.

788
00:44:09,471 --> 00:44:11,507
It would be pretty trying...

789
00:44:11,573 --> 00:44:14,110
Waves of sympathy
coming on the stage,

790
00:44:14,176 --> 00:44:16,345
all the gangways
flooded with tears.

791
00:44:16,412 --> 00:44:18,514
I can hardly bear
the thought myself.

792
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:20,716
No use trying to stop me.

793
00:44:20,782 --> 00:44:22,584
I'm going on tonight.

794
00:44:22,651 --> 00:44:24,086
Be at the theater

795
00:44:24,153 --> 00:44:25,154
at 6:00 sharp, will you?

796
00:44:25,221 --> 00:44:26,054
Yes, madam.

797
00:44:26,122 --> 00:44:29,225
Take this away.

798
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:30,559
You go right ahead, dear...

799
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:32,494
Garden-party dress
and everything.

800
00:44:32,561 --> 00:44:35,364
And why don't we
let ourselves...

801
00:44:35,431 --> 00:44:38,367
Go a trifle just in front, huh?

802
00:44:38,434 --> 00:44:41,069
And thank you so very much.

803
00:44:43,872 --> 00:44:46,975
What do you suppose
the police wants now?

804
00:44:47,042 --> 00:44:48,410
I don't know.

805
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:50,546
Must you speak to me
with your mouth full?

806
00:44:50,612 --> 00:44:52,381
They've probably come
to look under your bed

807
00:44:52,448 --> 00:44:53,782
for young master Cooper.

808
00:44:53,849 --> 00:44:56,185
What could I tell them
about Cooper?

809
00:44:56,252 --> 00:44:57,819
I know nothing about him.

810
00:44:57,886 --> 00:44:59,888
Tell them just that.

811
00:44:59,955 --> 00:45:01,557
Listen...

812
00:45:04,693 --> 00:45:06,428
That's a good idea.

813
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:08,430
Elsie darling, come here.

814
00:45:09,798 --> 00:45:11,433
Now, when the policemen
are here,

815
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,710
I want you to wait
in the other room and listen.

816
00:45:12,734 --> 00:45:13,869
When you hear me cough,

817
00:45:13,935 --> 00:45:15,280
you come in and say,
"the doctor's here."

818
00:45:15,304 --> 00:45:16,205
Have you got that?

819
00:45:16,272 --> 00:45:17,706
Yes, madam.

820
00:45:17,773 --> 00:45:19,775
You can stand
just so much of detectives.

821
00:45:19,841 --> 00:45:22,511
After all, they are only
policemen with smaller feet.

822
00:45:28,850 --> 00:45:29,918
In here?

823
00:45:29,985 --> 00:45:32,354
The next door, sir.

824
00:45:32,421 --> 00:45:34,290
What's the matter with Nellie?

825
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:35,957
Oh, it's her stomach, sir,

826
00:45:36,024 --> 00:45:37,426
if you'll excuse the expression.

827
00:45:37,493 --> 00:45:39,127
The tragedy
and excitement and all

828
00:45:39,195 --> 00:45:40,396
was too much for her.

829
00:45:40,462 --> 00:45:42,097
Highly strung type, eh?

830
00:45:42,164 --> 00:45:43,399
Oh, very, sir.

831
00:45:43,465 --> 00:45:45,467
And I suppose you know,
miss Inwood,

832
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:47,303
that whatever
Cooper's motive was,

833
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:49,471
it certainly couldn't
have been robbery.

834
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:52,174
Of course, darling.
I understand that.

835
00:45:52,241 --> 00:45:53,609
I suppose
he just tried

836
00:45:53,675 --> 00:45:55,411
to make it look like robbery.

837
00:45:55,477 --> 00:45:56,978
What's your name again?

838
00:45:57,045 --> 00:45:58,680
Doris, sir.

839
00:45:58,747 --> 00:45:59,981
You know, Doris,

840
00:46:00,048 --> 00:46:00,882
you're not bad-looking.

841
00:46:00,949 --> 00:46:02,618
Thank you, sir.

842
00:46:02,684 --> 00:46:04,095
You don't treat your
face properly, that's all.

843
00:46:04,119 --> 00:46:05,221
If you fixed your hair up

844
00:46:05,287 --> 00:46:06,388
and used a little make-up,

845
00:46:06,455 --> 00:46:07,856
you'd be quite attractive.

846
00:46:07,923 --> 00:46:09,234
I suppose I shouldn't
have seen him

847
00:46:09,258 --> 00:46:10,926
as often as I did,

848
00:46:10,992 --> 00:46:14,863
but I didn't realize how madly
infatuated he was with me.

849
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:17,499
I just didn't realize.

850
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:19,134
You'll never know how much

851
00:46:19,201 --> 00:46:21,503
I blame myself for all this.

852
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:24,340
When my husband came back
from New York last week

853
00:46:24,406 --> 00:46:26,342
and I told Jonnie
I couldn't see him,

854
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:28,176
he kept on phoning me.

855
00:46:28,244 --> 00:46:30,145
He wouldn't let me alone.

856
00:46:30,212 --> 00:46:32,448
Oh, maybe if I had
agreed to see him,

857
00:46:32,514 --> 00:46:34,416
he wouldn't have done
this dreadful thing.

858
00:46:34,483 --> 00:46:36,652
When did you last
see Jonathan Cooper?

859
00:46:36,718 --> 00:46:38,720
Let me think.

860
00:46:38,787 --> 00:46:41,490
It must have been a week...

861
00:46:41,557 --> 00:46:43,692
A week before my husband died.

862
00:46:45,727 --> 00:46:47,329
Go on.

863
00:46:47,396 --> 00:46:49,398
What are you waiting for?

864
00:46:52,033 --> 00:46:53,535
Excuse me, madam.

865
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:55,637
The doctor's
waiting to see you.

866
00:46:55,704 --> 00:46:57,105
Oh, I'm so sorry, darling,

867
00:46:57,172 --> 00:46:58,574
but I will have to
see my doctor.

868
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,276
I'm feeling wretched.

869
00:47:00,342 --> 00:47:02,611
I've been trying to
get him all morning.

870
00:47:02,678 --> 00:47:04,680
You see, I'm going on tonight.

871
00:47:04,746 --> 00:47:06,682
The producer
has insisted so much,

872
00:47:06,748 --> 00:47:08,750
and I don't want
to see him ruined

873
00:47:08,817 --> 00:47:09,818
because of me.

874
00:47:09,885 --> 00:47:11,186
That's all right.

875
00:47:11,253 --> 00:47:12,664
I think we've covered
most of the points.

876
00:47:12,688 --> 00:47:14,523
If there's any more
I can help you with,

877
00:47:14,590 --> 00:47:15,891
you will let me know, won't you?

878
00:47:15,957 --> 00:47:17,092
Thank you.

879
00:47:17,158 --> 00:47:18,794
We'll try not to
trouble you again.

880
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:20,128
Thank you.

881
00:47:20,195 --> 00:47:23,365
You're so understanding...

882
00:47:23,432 --> 00:47:24,900
And so are you.

883
00:47:24,966 --> 00:47:26,268
Doris,

884
00:47:26,335 --> 00:47:27,536
show the gentlemen out.

885
00:47:27,603 --> 00:47:28,780
It's all right,
thank you.

886
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:30,406
We can find our own way
downstairs.

887
00:47:32,974 --> 00:47:34,543
Freddie.

888
00:47:36,077 --> 00:47:37,188
Mavis, go down to the kitchen

889
00:47:37,212 --> 00:47:38,390
and get yourself a cup of tea.

890
00:47:38,414 --> 00:47:39,454
I'll ring when I need you.

891
00:47:39,515 --> 00:47:42,484
Yes. Thank you, madam.

892
00:48:27,363 --> 00:48:28,806
Darling, where's Jonathan?
Where is he?

893
00:48:28,830 --> 00:48:30,098
Friends may be hiding him.

894
00:48:30,165 --> 00:48:31,409
He had no friends.
He only had me.

895
00:48:31,433 --> 00:48:33,134
Well, I hope he hasn't made any,

896
00:48:33,201 --> 00:48:34,846
and I hope he hasn't taken
them into his confidence...

897
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:36,505
For your sake, his
sake, and their sake.

898
00:48:36,572 --> 00:48:38,073
What do you mean?

899
00:48:38,139 --> 00:48:39,541
If the truth comes out,

900
00:48:39,608 --> 00:48:41,109
it would break you.
I can't have that.

901
00:48:41,176 --> 00:48:42,243
What could you do?

902
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:43,345
You know me.

903
00:48:43,412 --> 00:48:45,547
You know how it is with me.

904
00:48:48,049 --> 00:48:49,618
You make me afraid.

905
00:48:49,685 --> 00:48:53,389
Not I. You don't know
what fear is.

906
00:48:53,455 --> 00:48:55,299
I've been working on
a tough kind of key.

907
00:48:56,392 --> 00:48:57,659
Oh, that would be most lovely.

908
00:48:57,726 --> 00:48:59,628
But of course, you must
be fond of swimming.

909
00:48:59,695 --> 00:49:01,162
But I am very fond of swimming.

910
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:02,330
Regularly, I have to go out

911
00:49:02,398 --> 00:49:03,799
to find somebody to swim with.

912
00:49:03,865 --> 00:49:06,201
And you don't live
in the country? Oh, dear.

913
00:49:06,267 --> 00:49:07,667
Of course, we miss
the rain so much,

914
00:49:07,703 --> 00:49:09,004
don't we...
All the flowers.

915
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:10,839
It's so disappointing.

916
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:13,509
I really must apologize for Eve,

917
00:49:13,575 --> 00:49:15,944
Mr...
Was the name Smith?

918
00:49:16,011 --> 00:49:17,613
Smith, yes.

919
00:49:17,679 --> 00:49:19,915
Smith. The name
seems familiar, somehow.

920
00:49:19,981 --> 00:49:20,849
I can't understand

921
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:23,318
why that girl is so late.

922
00:49:23,385 --> 00:49:25,220
I mean, she's
usually so punctual.

923
00:49:25,286 --> 00:49:26,522
She takes that from me.

924
00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:27,956
Her father isn't
punctual at all.

925
00:49:28,023 --> 00:49:29,558
I mean, he catches
trains and things,

926
00:49:29,625 --> 00:49:31,192
but always at the last moment.

927
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:33,228
I'm always there at
least an hour before.

928
00:49:33,294 --> 00:49:34,463
Yes.
I'm sure you are.

929
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:36,364
I have heard a lot
about you, Mrs. Gill.

930
00:49:36,432 --> 00:49:37,633
Oh, have you?

931
00:49:37,699 --> 00:49:39,635
Yes. Eve's very fond of me.

932
00:49:39,701 --> 00:49:42,370
Have you know her
long, Mr. Smith?

933
00:49:42,438 --> 00:49:43,872
I've got the name right now,

934
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:44,973
haven't I?

935
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,908
I've known her for about
a day and a half.

936
00:49:46,975 --> 00:49:50,546
Oh. That's not very long.

937
00:49:50,612 --> 00:49:51,613
Where did you meet?

938
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:52,781
As a matter of fact,

939
00:49:52,848 --> 00:49:55,350
we met in the saloon bar
of a pub.

940
00:49:55,417 --> 00:49:58,487
Well...
How interesting.

941
00:49:59,254 --> 00:50:00,489
Thank you.

942
00:50:00,556 --> 00:50:03,625
Am I intruding?

943
00:50:03,692 --> 00:50:05,326
This is Mr. Smith.

944
00:50:05,393 --> 00:50:06,795
Mr. Smith, this is Eve's father.

945
00:50:06,862 --> 00:50:08,497
We see him now and again.

946
00:50:08,564 --> 00:50:10,131
How do you do, sir?

947
00:50:10,198 --> 00:50:11,433
Very well, indeed.
Thank you.

948
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:13,134
Do sit down.

949
00:50:13,201 --> 00:50:14,436
Where's Eve?

950
00:50:14,503 --> 00:50:16,805
She should be here by this time.

951
00:50:16,872 --> 00:50:18,807
She asked Mr. Smith to tea.

952
00:50:18,874 --> 00:50:20,476
Oh, good, good, good.
Anyone else coming?

953
00:50:20,542 --> 00:50:21,819
I mean, is there
going to be a party?

954
00:50:21,843 --> 00:50:23,479
I am passionately fond
of parties.

955
00:50:23,545 --> 00:50:24,846
No. There's no one else coming,

956
00:50:24,913 --> 00:50:26,347
and you weren't invited.

957
00:50:26,414 --> 00:50:28,116
Wasn't I?
Oh, an oversight.

958
00:50:28,183 --> 00:50:29,551
Ah, but I forgive you.

959
00:50:29,618 --> 00:50:30,852
Forgiveness, Mr. Smith...

960
00:50:30,919 --> 00:50:32,263
The secret of
a happy married life...

961
00:50:32,287 --> 00:50:33,989
That and good long
stretches of the absence

962
00:50:34,055 --> 00:50:35,791
that makes the heart
grow fonder.

963
00:50:35,857 --> 00:50:37,058
There you are, my dear...

964
00:50:37,125 --> 00:50:39,861
The last but four
of the Mohicans.

965
00:50:43,632 --> 00:50:45,534
Will you forgive me,
Mr. ordinary Smith?

966
00:50:45,601 --> 00:50:46,911
Yes. I've just been
set an example.

967
00:50:46,935 --> 00:50:48,737
Yes, but he says his
name is just plain Smith.

968
00:50:48,804 --> 00:50:49,838
He did?

969
00:50:49,905 --> 00:50:51,372
I'm terribly sorry to be late,

970
00:50:51,439 --> 00:50:52,941
but the rehearsal
went on and on,

971
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:55,310
and the awful part is I have
to go back almost at once.

972
00:50:55,376 --> 00:50:56,921
It was very decent
of you to have come.

973
00:50:56,945 --> 00:50:58,514
Father! What are you
doing here?

974
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:00,215
I've been trying
to reach you all day.

975
00:51:00,281 --> 00:51:01,517
Well, I took the boat out.

976
00:51:01,583 --> 00:51:03,151
We had quite a little cruise...

977
00:51:03,218 --> 00:51:04,920
Jonnie and me.

978
00:51:06,287 --> 00:51:07,523
Poor old Jonnie.

979
00:51:07,589 --> 00:51:09,825
I hope his rheumatism is better.

980
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:13,862
Do play something, Mr. Smith.

981
00:51:13,929 --> 00:51:15,931
Mr. Smith is a pianist, mother.

982
00:51:15,997 --> 00:51:18,037
Well, I think that's
a delightful career.

983
00:51:18,066 --> 00:51:20,536
I often wish I'd kept
up my practicing.

984
00:51:20,602 --> 00:51:22,170
It's not exactly my
career, Mrs. Gill.

985
00:51:22,237 --> 00:51:23,815
But you must play for us.
Make him, mother.

986
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:26,374
But I haven't even
started my tea yet.

987
00:51:26,441 --> 00:51:27,375
But of course he hasn't.

988
00:51:27,442 --> 00:51:28,677
Eve, you are ridiculous.

989
00:51:28,744 --> 00:51:30,054
But I've got to leave
in a minute.

990
00:51:30,078 --> 00:51:32,413
Please play.

991
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:35,717
Jonnie's not much
of a sailor, Eve.

992
00:51:35,784 --> 00:51:37,519
He was abominably seasick.

993
00:51:37,586 --> 00:51:39,555
In fact, as soon
as we got ashore,

994
00:51:39,621 --> 00:51:41,623
Jonnie ran away.

995
00:51:41,690 --> 00:51:43,224
Who's Jonnie?

996
00:51:43,291 --> 00:51:44,660
I wish I knew.

997
00:51:44,726 --> 00:51:47,062
He's about 57
different varieties.

998
00:51:47,128 --> 00:51:48,329
I'd say, roughly speaking,

999
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:49,765
he was a dog of some sort

1000
00:51:49,831 --> 00:51:51,533
that strayed in a
couple of nights ago.

1001
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:52,934
Do the police know about him?

1002
00:51:53,001 --> 00:51:55,036
No. I'm not worried about him.

1003
00:51:55,103 --> 00:51:56,504
I daresay he'll find his way

1004
00:51:56,572 --> 00:51:58,607
back to his old
master... or mistress.

1005
00:51:58,674 --> 00:52:00,576
I thought for a minute

1006
00:52:00,642 --> 00:52:02,443
we might have to ask
for your help, Mr. Smith.

1007
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:04,980
Mr. Smith is
a detective, mother.

1008
00:52:05,046 --> 00:52:06,848
Mrs. Mason!

1009
00:52:10,151 --> 00:52:12,621
A detective...
How very unusual.

1010
00:52:12,688 --> 00:52:14,623
I suppose you have
many fascinating cases.

1011
00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:16,291
Must be
very exciting.

1012
00:52:16,357 --> 00:52:17,926
Not very, I'm afraid.

1013
00:52:17,993 --> 00:52:20,461
Embezzlement, fraud,
petty thefts...

1014
00:52:20,528 --> 00:52:21,763
Smuggling?

1015
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:23,464
Yes. Occasionally.
Brandy mostly.

1016
00:52:23,531 --> 00:52:25,634
Murder, too, sometimes, father.

1017
00:52:25,701 --> 00:52:29,771
Mr. Smith is working
on the Inwood case.

1018
00:52:29,838 --> 00:52:31,773
You don't say so.

1019
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:33,541
Yes. I read about
that somewhere.

1020
00:52:33,609 --> 00:52:35,844
How did you know?

1021
00:52:37,212 --> 00:52:38,647
I saw your photograph

1022
00:52:38,714 --> 00:52:40,115
in the paper.

1023
00:52:40,181 --> 00:52:41,617
What is the fellow's name...

1024
00:52:41,683 --> 00:52:43,118
Clippen... Clippen...
Cooper.

1025
00:52:43,184 --> 00:52:44,753
Did he do it, do you think?

1026
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:46,722
Well, he has run away
and remained in hiding.

1027
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:48,165
We are inclined
to accept the obvious

1028
00:52:48,189 --> 00:52:49,758
as being obvious.

1029
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,675
Oh, it's just like
Sherlock Holmes

1030
00:53:06,742 --> 00:53:08,644
and his fiddle...

1031
00:53:08,710 --> 00:53:10,345
A stream of beautiful sound,

1032
00:53:10,411 --> 00:53:11,647
and then suddenly

1033
00:53:11,713 --> 00:53:14,215
out pops the solution.

1034
00:53:25,426 --> 00:53:25,994
Oh, I must run!

1035
00:53:26,061 --> 00:53:27,228
So must I.

1036
00:53:27,295 --> 00:53:28,735
I don't know
what you'll think of me.

1037
00:53:28,797 --> 00:53:30,237
I like people
bound up in their work.

1038
00:53:30,298 --> 00:53:32,300
You'll make a very good
actress, indeed.

1039
00:53:32,367 --> 00:53:33,669
Au revoir, my pet.

1040
00:53:33,735 --> 00:53:36,872
Meet me at the stage door.

1041
00:53:39,775 --> 00:53:41,252
Can't I drive you
back to the academy?

1042
00:53:41,276 --> 00:53:42,844
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1043
00:53:42,911 --> 00:53:44,689
I do want you to get to know
father... not professionally.

1044
00:53:44,713 --> 00:53:46,181
But he's a wonderful character,

1045
00:53:46,247 --> 00:53:47,659
and they'd be hurt
if you didn't stay.

1046
00:53:47,683 --> 00:53:48,817
When will I see you again?

1047
00:53:48,884 --> 00:53:49,884
Well, I really don't...

1048
00:53:49,918 --> 00:53:51,095
Ring me tomorrow first thing...

1049
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:53,088
Regent 1-1-1-3.

1050
00:54:27,622 --> 00:54:29,925
I know you think I'm
an idiot, but I'm not.

1051
00:54:29,991 --> 00:54:31,559
I'm doing darn well.

1052
00:54:31,626 --> 00:54:32,560
Yes. You're giving a good show...

1053
00:54:32,627 --> 00:54:34,095
A very good show, indeed.

1054
00:54:34,162 --> 00:54:35,797
Pity you've no audience.

1055
00:54:35,864 --> 00:54:37,565
But you're my audience!

1056
00:54:37,632 --> 00:54:40,769
I wish you'd give me a
little applause now and then.

1057
00:54:40,836 --> 00:54:42,513
I wonder when poor
Jonathan is going to turn up.

1058
00:54:42,537 --> 00:54:43,839
Turn up where?

1059
00:54:43,905 --> 00:54:45,673
Wherever miss Charlotte
Inwood happens to be.

1060
00:54:45,741 --> 00:54:48,209
But good heavens!
She'll only turn him over.

1061
00:54:48,276 --> 00:54:51,813
Yes, and to your nice
new friend Mr. Smith.

1062
00:55:06,294 --> 00:55:08,496
Who was that man?

1063
00:55:08,563 --> 00:55:10,665
Oh, that was my dad, madam.

1064
00:55:10,732 --> 00:55:12,333
I told him about
my temporary job.

1065
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,803
He doesn't like it, what
with the murder and all,

1066
00:55:14,870 --> 00:55:16,137
you know, madam.

1067
00:55:16,204 --> 00:55:18,439
What's it got to do
with him or with you?

1068
00:55:18,506 --> 00:55:22,143
My dad says that man on
the run might turn up here,

1069
00:55:22,210 --> 00:55:24,279
might even get into
the dressing room,

1070
00:55:24,345 --> 00:55:26,481
might even murder me, madam.

1071
00:55:26,547 --> 00:55:27,682
It's the scene of the crime

1072
00:55:27,749 --> 00:55:29,851
the murderer returns to,
not the theater.

1073
00:55:29,918 --> 00:55:31,586
He might be right, my dad.

1074
00:55:31,652 --> 00:55:34,622
I'm surprised you're
not a bit afraid yourself.

1075
00:55:34,689 --> 00:55:36,324
Slippers.

1076
00:55:36,391 --> 00:55:39,094
This theater's the last
place he'd want to be seen in.

1077
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:41,763
Now, stop acting like
a silly schoolgirl.

1078
00:55:41,830 --> 00:55:44,900
The only murderer here
is the orchestra leader.

1079
00:56:03,384 --> 00:56:05,086
Father, you've got
to keep on the lookout

1080
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:06,221
and head Jonathan off.

1081
00:56:06,287 --> 00:56:09,290
Hmm? Right.
Certainly, my dear.

1082
00:56:09,357 --> 00:56:11,526
This is desperate.

1083
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:16,597
Go on, go on, go on, go on.

1084
00:59:40,568 --> 00:59:41,336
Madam. Madam.

1085
00:59:41,402 --> 00:59:42,203
What?

1086
00:59:42,270 --> 00:59:44,139
Madam, there's a man.

1087
00:59:44,205 --> 00:59:46,107
I think he's gone up
to your dressing room.

1088
00:59:46,174 --> 00:59:47,808
What are you talking
about? What man?

1089
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:50,578
I saw him. Don't go
up there. It's dangerous.

1090
00:59:50,645 --> 00:59:52,513
You're an imbecile.

1091
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:54,315
You needn't come up.

1092
00:59:54,382 --> 00:59:57,252
I'll manage to change myself.

1093
01:00:19,274 --> 01:00:21,409
I know, Jonnie,
darling,

1094
01:00:21,476 --> 01:00:23,311
but what a terrible
risk you've taken.

1095
01:00:23,378 --> 01:00:24,645
I couldn't keep away.

1096
01:00:24,712 --> 01:00:26,981
You haven't told me
where you've been.

1097
01:00:27,048 --> 01:00:28,716
Some friends looked after me.

1098
01:00:28,783 --> 01:00:29,884
What friends, darling?

1099
01:00:29,950 --> 01:00:31,452
Oh, never mind that just now.

1100
01:00:31,519 --> 01:00:33,388
We've got to work
out a plan of campaign.

1101
01:00:33,454 --> 01:00:34,974
But everything is
going on beautifully.

1102
01:00:35,022 --> 01:00:36,582
We've both got to
get a cast-iron story,

1103
01:00:36,624 --> 01:00:38,426
and we'll both
have to stick to it.

1104
01:00:38,493 --> 01:00:40,428
I must change.

1105
01:00:41,962 --> 01:00:43,174
You shouldn't have
come here, Jonnie.

1106
01:00:43,198 --> 01:00:45,400
You have been
so wonderful up to now.

1107
01:00:45,466 --> 01:00:46,934
Don't think that I'm ungrateful.

1108
01:00:47,001 --> 01:00:48,603
I'm not.
Truly, I'm not.

1109
01:00:48,669 --> 01:00:50,805
I don't know how
I shall ever repay you.

1110
01:00:50,871 --> 01:00:53,474
Repay me?

1111
01:00:53,541 --> 01:00:55,676
You talk as though
this were just a favor,

1112
01:00:55,743 --> 01:00:58,446
something that a "thank
you" can take care of.

1113
01:00:58,513 --> 01:00:59,947
Dearest, you mustn't be foolish.

1114
01:01:00,014 --> 01:01:02,750
You must go away
at once, back to...

1115
01:01:02,817 --> 01:01:04,552
Where you were hiding.

1116
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:05,996
Freddie's going to get
you out of the country

1117
01:01:06,020 --> 01:01:07,288
as soon as he can,

1118
01:01:07,355 --> 01:01:09,056
and I'll come to see you

1119
01:01:09,124 --> 01:01:10,367
when the run of the show's over.

1120
01:01:10,391 --> 01:01:11,892
But that may be months...

1121
01:01:11,959 --> 01:01:13,794
Maybe a year or more!

1122
01:01:13,861 --> 01:01:15,296
Well, you know how it is.

1123
01:01:15,363 --> 01:01:17,474
We were playing for capacity
before all this happened.

1124
01:01:17,498 --> 01:01:19,834
Now they're hanging
on to the chandeliers.

1125
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:21,402
£50 up tonight.

1126
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:24,038
Goodness knows how
they squeeze them in.

1127
01:01:24,105 --> 01:01:28,209
Yes. I could only
get standing room.

1128
01:01:28,276 --> 01:01:30,845
Well, there you are.

1129
01:01:30,911 --> 01:01:32,847
We'll find a lovely place...

1130
01:01:32,913 --> 01:01:34,982
South America or somewhere...

1131
01:01:35,049 --> 01:01:36,717
And I'll come out to you

1132
01:01:36,784 --> 01:01:39,820
as soon as all of
this has blown over.

1133
01:01:39,887 --> 01:01:41,856
I'll be glad of the rest

1134
01:01:41,922 --> 01:01:43,991
for a week or two.

1135
01:01:44,058 --> 01:01:47,728
Palm trees, sunshine.

1136
01:01:47,795 --> 01:01:49,797
Lovely.

1137
01:01:49,864 --> 01:01:51,599
A week or two?

1138
01:01:51,666 --> 01:01:53,501
Well, you don't want me

1139
01:01:53,568 --> 01:01:55,570
to give up everything, do you?

1140
01:01:56,103 --> 01:01:57,772
Why not?

1141
01:01:57,838 --> 01:01:59,807
I have.

1142
01:01:59,874 --> 01:02:01,276
Now, Jonnie,

1143
01:02:01,342 --> 01:02:02,419
I thought you said
that my happiness

1144
01:02:02,443 --> 01:02:04,011
was all that mattered,

1145
01:02:04,078 --> 01:02:07,915
and you must admit that
you behaved as if it was...

1146
01:02:07,982 --> 01:02:09,016
Taking all the trouble

1147
01:02:09,083 --> 01:02:10,618
to protect my reputation,

1148
01:02:10,685 --> 01:02:12,520
covering up the accident,

1149
01:02:12,587 --> 01:02:14,355
destroying that dreadful dress

1150
01:02:14,422 --> 01:02:15,856
with the bloodstain on it.

1151
01:02:15,923 --> 01:02:17,658
I didn't destroy it.

1152
01:02:20,361 --> 01:02:22,363
You didn't?

1153
01:02:24,165 --> 01:02:25,666
Jonnie, you promised.

1154
01:02:25,733 --> 01:02:29,304
Don't you realize if
they find the dress...

1155
01:02:31,606 --> 01:02:33,107
So long as I have that dress,

1156
01:02:33,174 --> 01:02:36,177
I'm the one who decides
how long this show will run...

1157
01:02:36,244 --> 01:02:37,778
And everything else.

1158
01:02:37,845 --> 01:02:39,947
Do you understand?

1159
01:02:40,014 --> 01:02:42,317
Where the devil is miss Inwood?

1160
01:02:42,383 --> 01:02:44,051
The orchestra's
started her number.

1161
01:02:44,118 --> 01:02:46,321
My socks and
suspenders! Where is she?

1162
01:02:46,387 --> 01:02:49,023
Take this.
I'll change downstairs.

1163
01:02:49,089 --> 01:02:51,526
Sorry, darling.
A hook broke.

1164
01:02:55,930 --> 01:02:57,365
Just a minute, Charlie.

1165
01:02:57,432 --> 01:02:58,642
Jonathan Cooper's
in the theater.

1166
01:02:58,666 --> 01:03:00,301
The sergeant's seen him.

1167
01:03:00,368 --> 01:03:01,912
He says he was sure
to make for your room.

1168
01:03:01,936 --> 01:03:03,371
Have you seen him?

1169
01:03:03,438 --> 01:03:05,039
Of course not.
What a stupid idea.

1170
01:03:05,105 --> 01:03:06,341
I think I'd better take a look

1171
01:03:06,407 --> 01:03:07,842
at your dressing
room all the same.

1172
01:03:07,908 --> 01:03:10,345
Doris, show sergeant
Loomis where to go.

1173
01:03:10,411 --> 01:03:12,046
Freddie, there's something...

1174
01:03:12,112 --> 01:03:15,350
Miss Inwood, please.

1175
01:03:15,416 --> 01:03:18,519
Doris, what are you
waiting for?

1176
01:03:30,998 --> 01:03:33,534
Oh, I feel so queer.
It's my heart.

1177
01:03:33,601 --> 01:03:35,536
The doctor told me I
should the stairs easy.

1178
01:03:35,603 --> 01:03:37,071
You don't think

1179
01:03:37,137 --> 01:03:38,406
he'll try to shoot his way out,

1180
01:03:38,473 --> 01:03:40,040
do you, sergeant?

1181
01:03:40,107 --> 01:03:41,876
He might be desperate, sergeant.

1182
01:03:41,942 --> 01:03:44,879
Don't you think you ought to
go back and get a policeman?

1183
01:04:24,785 --> 01:04:26,421
She was glad
he got away, father.

1184
01:04:26,487 --> 01:04:27,722
How do you know?

1185
01:04:27,788 --> 01:04:30,057
By a look she gave
Freddie Williams.

1186
01:04:30,124 --> 01:04:32,235
"Look she gave Freddie Williams."
That won't get you very far.

1187
01:04:32,259 --> 01:04:33,494
She'd be more delighted still

1188
01:04:33,561 --> 01:04:35,296
if she knew there was
no bloodstained dress.

1189
01:04:35,363 --> 01:04:36,664
Oh, yes.

1190
01:04:36,731 --> 01:04:38,475
All the same, I wish
we still had that dress.

1191
01:04:38,499 --> 01:04:40,501
There's so very little time.

1192
01:04:40,568 --> 01:04:42,202
We've got to make
every minute count.

1193
01:04:42,269 --> 01:04:44,038
I have to phone Smith tomorrow.

1194
01:04:44,104 --> 01:04:45,506
Why don't I invite him

1195
01:04:45,573 --> 01:04:47,508
to the theatrical
garden party with me?

1196
01:04:47,575 --> 01:04:49,510
I have to sell programs there.

1197
01:04:49,577 --> 01:04:52,212
I don't quite follow
you, my dear Holmes.

1198
01:04:52,279 --> 01:04:54,214
In order to make him see.

1199
01:04:54,281 --> 01:04:56,216
Nobody suspects
our Charlotte yet,

1200
01:04:56,283 --> 01:04:57,585
and they've got to.

1201
01:04:57,652 --> 01:05:00,087
First, to see
my mother and father

1202
01:05:00,154 --> 01:05:01,522
and get it approved by them.

1203
01:05:01,589 --> 01:05:03,066
Most parents nowadays
just don't seem to care

1204
01:05:03,090 --> 01:05:05,526
what sort of people their
children go around with,

1205
01:05:05,593 --> 01:05:07,528
but I'm not like that.

1206
01:05:07,595 --> 01:05:09,530
I know I'm very old-fashioned,

1207
01:05:09,597 --> 01:05:12,367
but I've got to think of Eve.

1208
01:05:12,433 --> 01:05:14,402
What do you do for a living?

1209
01:05:14,469 --> 01:05:16,236
Uh, I... I write a bit.

1210
01:05:16,303 --> 01:05:18,238
Oh! What, novels and things?

1211
01:05:18,305 --> 01:05:20,541
I'm very fond of novels.

1212
01:05:20,608 --> 01:05:22,543
You know, I read a
delightful one the other day.

1213
01:05:22,610 --> 01:05:24,244
Now, let me see.
What was the title?

1214
01:05:24,311 --> 01:05:25,546
It was written by that woman.

1215
01:05:25,613 --> 01:05:27,415
I can't remember her name,

1216
01:05:27,482 --> 01:05:28,592
but she's written
a number of books.

1217
01:05:28,616 --> 01:05:30,150
You must have read some of them.

1218
01:05:30,217 --> 01:05:31,552
They're all
about charming people.

1219
01:05:31,619 --> 01:05:34,054
She only writes about
the nice sort, you know.

1220
01:05:34,121 --> 01:05:36,557
Now, this book I was
telling you, you know,

1221
01:05:36,624 --> 01:05:39,259
the one whose title just slipped
my memory for the moment.

1222
01:05:39,326 --> 01:05:40,561
Well, it's about a mother,

1223
01:05:40,628 --> 01:05:42,262
which is a nice idea, isn't it?

1224
01:05:42,329 --> 01:05:43,564
I mean, one reads so much

1225
01:05:43,631 --> 01:05:45,065
about the younger generation.

1226
01:05:45,132 --> 01:05:46,610
It does seem a brilliant
idea to have a change.

1227
01:05:46,634 --> 01:05:48,403
Now, this mother isn't old.

1228
01:05:48,469 --> 01:05:50,070
I'm sorry to turn up
so late, Eve,

1229
01:05:50,137 --> 01:05:52,272
but I'm stranded
in town for the night.

1230
01:05:52,339 --> 01:05:53,574
All the hotels are full.

1231
01:05:53,641 --> 01:05:55,376
My flat's uninhabitable.

1232
01:05:55,443 --> 01:05:58,513
I told you, it's in the
hands of the decorators.

1233
01:05:58,579 --> 01:06:00,314
I know it's a
frightful imposition,

1234
01:06:00,381 --> 01:06:01,425
but I wondered
if you could give me

1235
01:06:01,449 --> 01:06:03,584
a shakedown somewhere?

1236
01:06:03,651 --> 01:06:05,586
Well, of course we can.

1237
01:06:05,653 --> 01:06:07,588
Can't we, mother?

1238
01:06:07,655 --> 01:06:10,090
Well, it's a little awkward.

1239
01:06:10,157 --> 01:06:12,860
Is your father proposing
to stay here, too?

1240
01:06:12,927 --> 01:06:14,328
Well, Jonathan could
have my room,

1241
01:06:14,395 --> 01:06:16,464
and I could sleep on the settee.

1242
01:06:16,531 --> 01:06:18,866
Where shall we put your father?

1243
01:06:21,669 --> 01:06:23,604
No. I'll sleep on the settee,

1244
01:06:23,671 --> 01:06:25,606
and you can sleep
with your mamma.

1245
01:06:25,673 --> 01:06:27,608
I hate to put you
to all this trouble.

1246
01:06:27,675 --> 01:06:29,143
Oh, not at all,
Mr...

1247
01:06:29,209 --> 01:06:30,209
What is your name?

1248
01:06:31,311 --> 01:06:32,212
Jones. Brown. Robinson.

1249
01:06:32,279 --> 01:06:33,848
Robinson.

1250
01:06:33,914 --> 01:06:35,291
Mr. Robinson, I think
we'll make it bye-byes.

1251
01:06:35,315 --> 01:06:36,383
Come along.

1252
01:06:36,451 --> 01:06:37,618
A blanket for the commodore,

1253
01:06:37,685 --> 01:06:38,986
and we'll all go to bye-byes.

1254
01:06:39,053 --> 01:06:42,389
Robinson... I've heard
that name before.

1255
01:06:45,693 --> 01:06:47,127
No, it won't do.

1256
01:06:47,194 --> 01:06:49,329
Has Eve gone mad,
turning the house into a hotel

1257
01:06:49,396 --> 01:06:50,631
in the middle of the night?

1258
01:06:50,698 --> 01:06:53,133
Who is this man, anyway?
What is his name?

1259
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:55,135
Well, perhaps we'd
better not mention it.

1260
01:06:55,202 --> 01:06:58,072
The fact is, he's a
fugitive from justice.

1261
01:06:58,138 --> 01:07:00,074
The whole police
force is on his heels,

1262
01:07:00,140 --> 01:07:02,309
and Eve, well, for reasons
of her own, my dear,

1263
01:07:02,376 --> 01:07:04,078
doesn't want him to be caught.

1264
01:07:04,144 --> 01:07:08,348
He's... He's wanted for murder.

1265
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:10,751
Now you're going too far.

1266
01:07:12,419 --> 01:07:13,697
I suppose you think
I believed that

1267
01:07:13,721 --> 01:07:15,656
that Mr. Smith
who came here to tea

1268
01:07:15,723 --> 01:07:18,092
was a real detective.

1269
01:07:24,331 --> 01:07:26,166
And if I hadn't heard
her maid's scared voice

1270
01:07:26,233 --> 01:07:28,111
outside the dressing room
door, they'd have got me.

1271
01:07:28,135 --> 01:07:29,303
Oh, Eve, darling,

1272
01:07:29,369 --> 01:07:31,171
I know I should
never have trusted her.

1273
01:07:31,238 --> 01:07:33,674
Oh, darling, you've
been wonderful to me.

1274
01:07:33,741 --> 01:07:35,643
I don't deserve it,
but I need you.

1275
01:07:35,710 --> 01:07:37,678
I need you more than ever.

1276
01:07:37,745 --> 01:07:40,180
Tonight, when I found
what Charlotte was,

1277
01:07:40,247 --> 01:07:42,683
all of a sudden I thought
my brain would burst.

1278
01:07:42,750 --> 01:07:44,384
After all that I'd done for her!

1279
01:07:44,451 --> 01:07:45,786
Everything I did for her

1280
01:07:45,853 --> 01:07:48,388
was because I loved her
and she loved me...

1281
01:08:06,273 --> 01:08:07,474
I'm so sorry.

1282
01:08:07,542 --> 01:08:08,976
Why the umbrella?

1283
01:08:09,043 --> 01:08:11,478
Huh? It is a garden
party, isn't it?

1284
01:08:11,546 --> 01:08:14,248
Oh, roehampton club, please.

1285
01:08:17,718 --> 01:08:19,286
It couldn't be
helped, I'm afraid.

1286
01:08:19,353 --> 01:08:21,488
You must blame a
miss Doris Tinsdale.

1287
01:08:21,556 --> 01:08:23,991
Who is Doris Tinsdale?

1288
01:08:24,058 --> 01:08:26,293
Hmm? Oh, she's Charlotte
Inwood's temporary dresser.

1289
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:28,996
We've been searching
for her all the afternoon.

1290
01:08:29,063 --> 01:08:30,998
One of our men at
the theater last night

1291
01:08:31,065 --> 01:08:32,499
let her slip through his fingers

1292
01:08:32,567 --> 01:08:34,501
without making a statement.

1293
01:08:34,569 --> 01:08:36,771
You look very lovely.

1294
01:08:38,072 --> 01:08:40,274
You're very sweet to say so.

1295
01:08:41,576 --> 01:08:43,510
What has this Doris
Tinsdale person

1296
01:08:43,578 --> 01:08:45,012
got to do with the case,

1297
01:08:45,079 --> 01:08:47,014
or shouldn't I ask, Mr. Smith?

1298
01:08:47,081 --> 01:08:49,016
Oh, Cooper was at
the theater last night,

1299
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:50,517
and we think she saw him.

1300
01:08:50,585 --> 01:08:52,219
And don't call me Mr. Smith.

1301
01:08:52,286 --> 01:08:54,221
After all, my name is...

1302
01:08:54,288 --> 01:08:55,623
Wilfrid.

1303
01:08:56,757 --> 01:08:58,458
Not very good, is it?

1304
01:08:58,525 --> 01:09:01,028
It suits some people
very nicely.

1305
01:09:01,095 --> 01:09:04,765
I rather liked it when you
called me "ordinary" Smith.

1306
01:09:04,832 --> 01:09:06,333
Oh, I didn't mean to, really.

1307
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:08,335
Oh, but I liked it. I
liked it very much.

1308
01:09:08,402 --> 01:09:11,538
Please go on calling
me that, will you?

1309
01:09:11,606 --> 01:09:13,240
Yes, I will.

1310
01:09:15,943 --> 01:09:18,245
What were we talking about?

1311
01:09:18,312 --> 01:09:19,546
Oh, yes.

1312
01:09:19,614 --> 01:09:21,048
I was going to ask you...

1313
01:09:21,115 --> 01:09:23,718
Why did Cooper risk
going to the theater?

1314
01:09:23,784 --> 01:09:25,920
He must have had
a very strong reason

1315
01:09:25,986 --> 01:09:27,163
for wanting to talk
to miss Inwood.

1316
01:09:27,187 --> 01:09:28,388
Look, let's not talk shop

1317
01:09:28,455 --> 01:09:29,523
on a nice day like this.

1318
01:09:29,590 --> 01:09:31,659
Oh, I am sorry.

1319
01:09:31,726 --> 01:09:33,360
Do you hate inquisitive people?

1320
01:09:33,427 --> 01:09:36,263
Ha ha! Of course
not. I'm one myself.

1321
01:09:36,330 --> 01:09:39,566
But seriously, ordinary,

1322
01:09:39,634 --> 01:09:41,268
do you think there's anything

1323
01:09:41,335 --> 01:09:42,970
between Cooper and miss Inwood?

1324
01:09:43,037 --> 01:09:45,572
Seriously,

1325
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:47,074
extraordinary,

1326
01:09:47,141 --> 01:09:49,143
I shouldn't be a bit surprised.

1327
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:56,083
What a curious person
she must be...

1328
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:58,452
I mean, going back on the stage

1329
01:09:58,518 --> 01:10:01,455
so soon after everything.

1330
01:10:01,521 --> 01:10:03,523
The show must go on.

1331
01:10:03,590 --> 01:10:05,325
A smiling face,
a breaking heart...

1332
01:10:05,392 --> 01:10:07,795
Actors rather like it, I'm told.

1333
01:10:09,296 --> 01:10:10,831
But today...

1334
01:10:10,898 --> 01:10:14,034
Going right from the
funeral to the garden party...

1335
01:10:14,101 --> 01:10:17,537
I must say, I think that's
overdoing things a bit.

1336
01:10:17,604 --> 01:10:19,573
A strong sense
of dramatics, hmm?

1337
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:21,141
All that sort of thing.

1338
01:10:22,242 --> 01:10:24,544
It's...

1339
01:10:24,611 --> 01:10:27,314
So cold and calculating of her.

1340
01:10:28,482 --> 01:10:29,850
Is it?

1341
01:10:31,618 --> 01:10:33,821
Yes, it is.

1342
01:10:35,622 --> 01:10:38,258
If she's that cold
and calculating,

1343
01:10:38,325 --> 01:10:40,494
I was wondering...

1344
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:41,729
Maybe she had something to do

1345
01:10:41,796 --> 01:10:44,564
with her husband's death.

1346
01:10:44,631 --> 01:10:46,266
Were you?

1347
01:10:47,634 --> 01:10:49,469
After all,

1348
01:10:49,536 --> 01:10:52,707
there must be a lot that
doesn't appear on the surface...

1349
01:10:52,773 --> 01:10:59,313
I mean, like wheels
within wheels.

1350
01:10:59,379 --> 01:11:03,017
Who knows what goes on
in a woman's mind?

1351
01:11:04,584 --> 01:11:07,054
I don't know.

1352
01:11:07,121 --> 01:11:09,456
And if I don't know, I...

1353
01:11:09,523 --> 01:11:11,291
Well...

1354
01:11:11,358 --> 01:11:14,094
Who?

1355
01:11:14,161 --> 01:11:17,364
Uh, a woman's mind sometimes...

1356
01:11:18,665 --> 01:11:21,869
I was saying
that a woman's mind...

1357
01:11:23,370 --> 01:11:24,872
That's right.

1358
01:11:26,373 --> 01:11:28,375
Do you really?

1359
01:11:29,309 --> 01:11:31,611
I think so, too.

1360
01:11:31,678 --> 01:11:34,314
In miss Inwood's case...

1361
01:11:34,381 --> 01:11:36,316
What?

1362
01:11:36,383 --> 01:11:37,885
What?

1363
01:12:07,748 --> 01:12:09,283
I have to report
to the committee tent

1364
01:12:09,349 --> 01:12:12,319
to get my programs.

1365
01:12:12,386 --> 01:12:14,188
Whether to give it
to the orphans

1366
01:12:14,254 --> 01:12:16,590
or to let
the government take it.

1367
01:12:16,656 --> 01:12:17,958
I'm putting it to you.

1368
01:12:18,025 --> 01:12:20,160
Oh, there's the
committee tent over there.

1369
01:12:20,227 --> 01:12:21,972
You do understand that
I won't be able to spend

1370
01:12:21,996 --> 01:12:23,206
the whole afternoon
with you, don't you?

1371
01:12:23,230 --> 01:12:24,307
Oh, can't I go around with you?

1372
01:12:24,331 --> 01:12:25,800
I can sell a mean program.

1373
01:12:25,866 --> 01:12:27,567
We bloodhounds have
methods of our own.

1374
01:12:27,634 --> 01:12:29,579
But you must go off and amuse
yourself. I can't take you with me.

1375
01:12:29,603 --> 01:12:31,171
Every time I'm
beginning to think I know

1376
01:12:31,238 --> 01:12:32,315
what color your eyes
are, you disappear.

1377
01:12:32,339 --> 01:12:33,874
Can't I come with you?

1378
01:12:33,941 --> 01:12:35,351
But it's against the rules.
Now please go away.

1379
01:12:35,375 --> 01:12:38,512
I'll pick you up later.
I'll get in trouble.

1380
01:12:39,746 --> 01:12:41,381
Step right up.

1381
01:12:41,448 --> 01:12:43,050
Yes, madam.
Over here.

1382
01:12:43,117 --> 01:12:45,552
Eve, you brute.
Wherever have you been?

1383
01:12:45,619 --> 01:12:46,553
You're hours late.

1384
01:12:46,620 --> 01:12:47,487
I'm sorry, chubby.

1385
01:12:47,554 --> 01:12:49,589
What a day.
What a day.

1386
01:12:49,656 --> 01:12:51,391
Hello, Valerie.
Hello, Eve.

1387
01:12:51,458 --> 01:12:53,027
By the way,
this is Wilfrid Smith...

1388
01:12:53,093 --> 01:12:54,370
Chubby bannister
and Valerie Maynard.

1389
01:12:54,394 --> 01:12:55,729
They're at R.A.D.A. With me.

1390
01:12:55,796 --> 01:12:57,497
Well, how do you do,
Mr. Smith?

1391
01:12:57,564 --> 01:12:58,899
How do you do?

1392
01:12:58,966 --> 01:13:00,110
I'm sure you'd love
to have some ice cream,

1393
01:13:00,134 --> 01:13:01,211
and chubby could
show you where it is.

1394
01:13:01,235 --> 01:13:02,345
Oh, but I'd adore to.

1395
01:13:02,369 --> 01:13:04,238
That's most good of you.

1396
01:13:04,304 --> 01:13:05,949
I'll hope you'll remember
me by this little token

1397
01:13:05,973 --> 01:13:08,608
of my regard and esteem.

1398
01:13:08,675 --> 01:13:10,510
Allow me.

1399
01:13:10,577 --> 01:13:12,712
As you know, this fete
is being held

1400
01:13:12,779 --> 01:13:15,115
for the aid of the
actors' orphanage.

1401
01:13:15,182 --> 01:13:16,917
Now, it's raining outside,

1402
01:13:16,984 --> 01:13:18,718
and if you've got time
to spare, come in...

1403
01:13:18,785 --> 01:13:20,220
Which programs shall I take?

1404
01:13:20,287 --> 01:13:21,388
Take that pile, dear.

1405
01:13:21,455 --> 01:13:23,190
Thank you.

1406
01:13:32,266 --> 01:13:34,734
You newspaperwomen
work hard at your job,

1407
01:13:34,801 --> 01:13:36,436
don't you, miss Gill?

1408
01:13:36,503 --> 01:13:38,005
How did you know my name?

1409
01:13:38,072 --> 01:13:40,574
I called that number you
gave me in case of emergency.

1410
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:41,708
A Mrs. Gill answered,

1411
01:13:41,775 --> 01:13:43,543
and I put two and two together.

1412
01:13:43,610 --> 01:13:45,745
Well, what did you need
me for in such a hurry?

1413
01:13:45,812 --> 01:13:47,290
Listen, don't you talk
to me like that.

1414
01:13:47,314 --> 01:13:49,149
I've come all the way
down here to tell you

1415
01:13:49,216 --> 01:13:50,851
miss Inwood's looking for you.

1416
01:13:50,918 --> 01:13:52,586
What does she want?

1417
01:13:52,652 --> 01:13:53,729
She wants you here, of course,

1418
01:13:53,753 --> 01:13:55,222
and what's more, she said

1419
01:13:55,289 --> 01:13:57,724
the police want to talk
to a miss Doris Tinsdale.

1420
01:13:57,791 --> 01:14:00,260
She wants to know when
I'm going back to my work,

1421
01:14:00,327 --> 01:14:02,562
and I told her my stomach
was still out of order.

1422
01:14:02,629 --> 01:14:04,131
Well, it's better now...

1423
01:14:04,198 --> 01:14:05,732
Much better, thank you.

1424
01:14:05,799 --> 01:14:07,301
You want more money, don't you?

1425
01:14:07,367 --> 01:14:08,727
Well, look at the risk
I'm running.

1426
01:14:08,768 --> 01:14:09,669
I think I'd better go
to miss Inwood

1427
01:14:09,736 --> 01:14:10,804
and tell her everything...

1428
01:14:10,871 --> 01:14:13,874
And before that detective
finds out

1429
01:14:13,941 --> 01:14:16,510
there's no such person as Doris.

1430
01:14:16,576 --> 01:14:19,446
Here's £5.00. It's
all I have with me.

1431
01:14:20,514 --> 01:14:22,516
Oh, my job's worth
more than that...

1432
01:14:22,582 --> 01:14:24,018
At least another 20.

1433
01:14:24,084 --> 01:14:25,561
I'll meet you
outside miss Inwood's tent

1434
01:14:25,585 --> 01:14:27,487
in half an hour.

1435
01:14:32,392 --> 01:14:35,029
Finished already?
You are doing well.

1436
01:14:35,095 --> 01:14:36,372
May I use your
phone, miss Coop-jex?

1437
01:14:36,396 --> 01:14:38,532
Why, yes. Of course,
my dear. There it is.

1438
01:14:38,598 --> 01:14:40,300
Thank you.

1439
01:14:47,407 --> 01:14:48,775
Hello.
Is that you, father?

1440
01:14:48,842 --> 01:14:50,344
Could you come right away?

1441
01:14:50,410 --> 01:14:52,446
With all the money you
can lay your hands on.

1442
01:14:52,512 --> 01:14:55,049
At least £20...
At least!

1443
01:14:55,115 --> 01:14:57,051
It's Nellie.

1444
01:14:57,117 --> 01:14:59,286
The girl I'm understudying.

1445
01:14:59,353 --> 01:15:02,356
Yes. Be quick, darling.

1446
01:15:02,422 --> 01:15:04,558
No queuing.
No queuing here.

1447
01:15:04,624 --> 01:15:06,126
Step right up.

1448
01:15:06,193 --> 01:15:09,296
Yes, madam, over here.

1449
01:15:10,130 --> 01:15:11,631
Doris, isn't it?

1450
01:15:15,335 --> 01:15:16,636
Yes, sir.

1451
01:15:18,138 --> 01:15:20,574
Yes, sir. I took
your advice, sir.

1452
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:22,076
I done meself up!

1453
01:15:22,142 --> 01:15:24,478
I mean... what do you
think of it?

1454
01:15:24,544 --> 01:15:26,246
Where have you been?

1455
01:15:26,313 --> 01:15:28,148
Oh, I can explain it,
sir. Only yesterday...

1456
01:15:28,215 --> 01:15:30,750
Come along. I'll take
you to miss Inwood.

1457
01:15:30,817 --> 01:15:32,252
Come on, hurry.

1458
01:15:32,319 --> 01:15:34,088
Roll up, roll up, roll up.

1459
01:15:34,154 --> 01:15:35,589
Come and have a good time.

1460
01:15:35,655 --> 01:15:37,657
Come on, sir.
You, sir.

1461
01:15:41,195 --> 01:15:43,097
Miss Tinsdale
to see you.

1462
01:15:43,163 --> 01:15:44,398
Well, this is a pleasure.

1463
01:15:44,464 --> 01:15:46,233
Where have you been?
I thought you were dead.

1464
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:48,402
Oh, no, madam.
I wasn't.

1465
01:15:48,468 --> 01:15:50,370
As a matter of fact...

1466
01:15:50,437 --> 01:15:51,614
You needn't go
into detail, darling.

1467
01:15:51,638 --> 01:15:53,240
I hope you're not
going to turn into

1468
01:15:53,307 --> 01:15:54,917
one of those explicit
people who always tell you

1469
01:15:54,941 --> 01:15:57,644
exactly how they feel
when you ask them.

1470
01:15:57,711 --> 01:16:00,147
You did leave me a
trifle suspended, however.

1471
01:16:00,214 --> 01:16:02,116
I'm sorry, madam.

1472
01:16:02,182 --> 01:16:03,683
I was held up.

1473
01:16:04,851 --> 01:16:06,420
Darling!

1474
01:16:06,486 --> 01:16:09,789
Whatever happened to
that peculiar figure of yours?

1475
01:16:09,856 --> 01:16:12,326
It's a new dress, madam.

1476
01:16:12,392 --> 01:16:14,128
Keep it, dear.

1477
01:16:14,194 --> 01:16:16,163
What it does for you
is worth thousands.

1478
01:16:16,230 --> 01:16:17,697
I bought it at a sale.

1479
01:16:17,764 --> 01:16:21,401
Don't confide in me. Just
pour some tea, would you?

1480
01:16:24,204 --> 01:16:26,573
By the way, Doris,

1481
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:30,044
did Nellie tell you the
police want to talk to you?

1482
01:16:30,110 --> 01:16:32,446
But whatever for, madam?

1483
01:16:32,512 --> 01:16:34,048
Oh, I hope they won't
upset my dad.

1484
01:16:34,114 --> 01:16:36,050
My dad said...

1485
01:16:36,116 --> 01:16:38,452
They're not going to eat
you, darling. It's not important.

1486
01:16:38,518 --> 01:16:40,087
Just pull yourself together

1487
01:16:40,154 --> 01:16:42,489
and pour the tea.

1488
01:16:45,925 --> 01:16:48,062
Rehearsals, rehearsals,
from morning till night.

1489
01:16:48,128 --> 01:16:49,563
If we wanted
to misbehave ourselves,

1490
01:16:49,629 --> 01:16:51,398
we couldn't find
a minute to do it in.

1491
01:16:51,465 --> 01:16:52,866
Yes.
So I understand.

1492
01:16:52,932 --> 01:16:54,868
Eve tells me she
kept hard at it all day

1493
01:16:54,934 --> 01:16:56,070
and most of the evening.

1494
01:16:56,136 --> 01:16:58,004
But Eve hasn't been
near for days.

1495
01:16:58,072 --> 01:17:00,074
I thought she was home
with a cold or something.

1496
01:17:00,140 --> 01:17:02,242
Maybe she's got a job in a show.

1497
01:17:02,309 --> 01:17:04,078
A fortune
in five minutes

1498
01:17:04,144 --> 01:17:06,613
and earn no income tax on it...

1499
01:17:21,161 --> 01:17:23,097
Excuse me, madam.

1500
01:17:23,163 --> 01:17:26,166
I... I've got to sneeze!

1501
01:17:49,989 --> 01:17:51,033
Miss Livingstone, I presume?

1502
01:17:51,057 --> 01:17:52,626
That's not my name.

1503
01:17:52,692 --> 01:17:54,461
Oh, no, no. It's
Nellie Goode, isn't it?

1504
01:17:54,528 --> 01:17:55,929
But what does the name matter?

1505
01:17:55,995 --> 01:17:57,864
After all, I could
think of lots and lots

1506
01:17:57,931 --> 01:17:59,566
of much more
appropriate names for you.

1507
01:17:59,633 --> 01:18:03,637
I could think of a few for
you, too. Who are you?

1508
01:18:03,703 --> 01:18:05,572
I understand my
daughter has entered

1509
01:18:05,639 --> 01:18:07,283
into a somewhat shady
transaction with you.

1510
01:18:07,307 --> 01:18:08,875
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1511
01:18:08,942 --> 01:18:10,944
Well, you are a
blackmailer, aren't you?

1512
01:18:11,010 --> 01:18:14,013
You know, that's a very,
very naughty thing to be.

1513
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:15,649
Don't you say things
like that to me.

1514
01:18:15,715 --> 01:18:17,693
Do you know you could be had
up for saying a thing like that?

1515
01:18:17,717 --> 01:18:19,319
Now, don't be so peppery.

1516
01:18:19,386 --> 01:18:21,121
I like to keep things
on a friendly basis.

1517
01:18:21,188 --> 01:18:22,556
One short!

1518
01:18:22,622 --> 01:18:24,158
Well, it's all I've got.

1519
01:18:24,224 --> 01:18:25,859
You don't want me to
walk home, do you?

1520
01:18:25,925 --> 01:18:27,627
I don't care if you crawl home.

1521
01:18:27,694 --> 01:18:29,663
It doesn't matter.
I'm not mean.

1522
01:18:29,729 --> 01:18:32,132
And you've got till
tomorrow morning.

1523
01:18:33,233 --> 01:18:34,668
Oh, father, Freddie Williams,

1524
01:18:34,734 --> 01:18:36,670
Charlotte's manager,
spotted me as Doris.

1525
01:18:36,736 --> 01:18:38,172
I had to go into
Charlotte's tent.

1526
01:18:38,238 --> 01:18:40,174
Well, if there's
one thing I hate,

1527
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:41,675
it's saying, "I told you so."

1528
01:18:41,741 --> 01:18:43,181
And the police want
to talk to Doris.

1529
01:18:43,243 --> 01:18:45,179
I don't know which way to turn.

1530
01:18:45,245 --> 01:18:46,680
I think I'll get a hold of Smith

1531
01:18:46,746 --> 01:18:48,182
and tell him the whole story.

1532
01:18:48,248 --> 01:18:50,284
Have you got him
to suspect Charlotte yet?

1533
01:18:50,350 --> 01:18:51,985
I'm afraid not.

1534
01:18:52,051 --> 01:18:54,688
Hmm? But I thought you
had to pick him up at Whitehall.

1535
01:18:54,754 --> 01:18:56,456
Didn't you talk to him about it?

1536
01:18:57,891 --> 01:18:59,393
Yes, I did...

1537
01:19:00,794 --> 01:19:02,296
In a way.

1538
01:19:03,797 --> 01:19:04,964
In a way?

1539
01:19:05,031 --> 01:19:07,201
Oh, I see.

1540
01:19:07,267 --> 01:19:09,203
Some more important topic arose

1541
01:19:09,269 --> 01:19:11,205
in the conversation, hmm?

1542
01:19:11,271 --> 01:19:13,907
Well, there's one slight
complication, my dear...

1543
01:19:13,973 --> 01:19:15,209
Jonathan.

1544
01:19:15,275 --> 01:19:16,710
You're not by any chance

1545
01:19:16,776 --> 01:19:18,254
thinking of changing
horses in midstream?

1546
01:19:18,278 --> 01:19:20,013
Father, is it awful of me?

1547
01:19:20,079 --> 01:19:23,883
Not awful, my dear... just
rather a bad bit of timing.

1548
01:19:23,950 --> 01:19:25,852
No matter how my
feelings toward him change,

1549
01:19:25,919 --> 01:19:28,222
I still can't let
Jonathan down, can I?

1550
01:19:28,288 --> 01:19:30,724
Not while he's hiding
in our house.

1551
01:19:43,002 --> 01:19:44,738
Call yourself an actress?

1552
01:19:44,804 --> 01:19:46,240
There's your big scene,

1553
01:19:46,306 --> 01:19:47,483
if you've the pluck to take it.

1554
01:19:47,507 --> 01:19:49,042
You have the law on your arm.

1555
01:19:49,108 --> 01:19:51,611
All you have to do is to
rush in there and shout,

1556
01:19:51,678 --> 01:19:53,247
"stop. That woman
is a murderess."

1557
01:19:53,313 --> 01:19:55,048
And then she'll say,
"how dare you!"

1558
01:19:55,114 --> 01:19:57,251
And you'll say, "I'll
dare and dare again!

1559
01:19:57,317 --> 01:19:59,185
"What about the
bloodstained dress,

1560
01:19:59,253 --> 01:20:01,187
eh, miss Charlotte Inwood?"

1561
01:20:01,255 --> 01:20:02,689
And then she'll say...

1562
01:20:02,756 --> 01:20:04,691
Please. This is serious, father.

1563
01:20:04,758 --> 01:20:06,826
Oh, Eve!
There you are.

1564
01:20:06,893 --> 01:20:08,695
I couldn't find you anywhere.

1565
01:20:08,762 --> 01:20:10,997
Oh, I've been trying to
get rid of my programs.

1566
01:20:11,064 --> 01:20:12,904
I've been too busy
talking to Mr. Smith

1567
01:20:12,966 --> 01:20:14,200
to sell any of mine.

1568
01:20:14,268 --> 01:20:15,702
Do you think I talk too much?

1569
01:20:15,769 --> 01:20:17,247
No. Most women
don't talk enough.

1570
01:20:17,271 --> 01:20:18,705
I hate shy women.

1571
01:20:18,772 --> 01:20:20,974
No one could
ever call me shy.

1572
01:20:39,293 --> 01:20:40,927
Who'll pay half a crown

1573
01:20:40,994 --> 01:20:42,962
to shoot lovely ducks?

1574
01:20:43,029 --> 01:20:46,232
Who'll come over and
shoot some lovely ducks?

1575
01:20:46,300 --> 01:20:47,734
It's only half a crown.

1576
01:20:47,801 --> 01:20:50,570
It does such good
for the orphans.

1577
01:20:50,637 --> 01:20:52,205
Who'll come and shoot
lovely ducks here

1578
01:20:52,272 --> 01:20:53,740
for half a crown?

1579
01:20:53,807 --> 01:20:56,810
Only half a crown
to shoot lovely ducks!

1580
01:21:01,315 --> 01:21:03,483
Eve.

1581
01:21:04,851 --> 01:21:06,520
Excuse me.

1582
01:21:08,021 --> 01:21:09,255
Look, Eve, hold everything.

1583
01:21:09,323 --> 01:21:10,757
I have an idea.

1584
01:21:10,824 --> 01:21:12,959
Get Smith into Charlotte's tent

1585
01:21:13,026 --> 01:21:14,961
as near the front as you can.

1586
01:21:15,028 --> 01:21:16,530
Go on, quickly!

1587
01:21:18,832 --> 01:21:20,266
What do you say we go in

1588
01:21:20,334 --> 01:21:21,968
and hear Charlotte sing?

1589
01:21:22,035 --> 01:21:23,269
Oh, do let's!

1590
01:21:23,337 --> 01:21:26,272
The murder makes her
so interesting.

1591
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:28,074
You know, I think
I'll wait outside.

1592
01:21:28,141 --> 01:21:29,876
But you promised.

1593
01:21:29,943 --> 01:21:31,277
I promised?

1594
01:21:31,345 --> 01:21:32,712
In the taxi.

1595
01:21:32,779 --> 01:21:34,247
You said the first thing we'd do

1596
01:21:34,314 --> 01:21:36,282
would be to go in and
hear Charlotte Inwood.

1597
01:21:36,350 --> 01:21:39,285
Don't you remember?

1598
01:21:39,353 --> 01:21:40,787
Do you know, I can't remember.

1599
01:21:40,854 --> 01:21:44,791
I must have had
some sort of a blackout.

1600
01:21:44,858 --> 01:21:48,261
Oh, do let's hurry!
We'll miss her.

1601
01:21:48,328 --> 01:21:49,596
Lovely ducks over here.

1602
01:21:49,663 --> 01:21:51,263
Only half a crown
to shoot a lovely duck.

1603
01:21:51,297 --> 01:21:52,799
You can win a lovely prize!

1604
01:21:52,866 --> 01:21:55,301
Heavenly prizes! Only
half a crown to shoot...

1605
01:21:55,369 --> 01:21:56,703
Would you like to shoot a duck?

1606
01:21:56,770 --> 01:21:58,037
No, no, no.
I hate firearms.

1607
01:21:58,104 --> 01:22:00,306
I wonder if I could
buy one of those dolls.

1608
01:22:00,374 --> 01:22:01,675
A doll?
Which doll?

1609
01:22:01,741 --> 01:22:03,543
Oh, any doll...
That doll.

1610
01:22:03,610 --> 01:22:05,287
Yes, I suppose you could,
but you'll have to pay for it.

1611
01:22:05,311 --> 01:22:06,813
But how much, please?

1612
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:08,214
Well, it's for the orphans.

1613
01:22:08,281 --> 01:22:09,916
I know, but how much?

1614
01:22:09,983 --> 01:22:11,394
You are sorry for the
orphans, aren't you?

1615
01:22:11,418 --> 01:22:13,720
Of course I am, but how much?

1616
01:22:13,787 --> 01:22:15,822
We all are, aren't we?

1617
01:22:15,889 --> 01:22:19,559
Well, I suppose...
At least £4.00.

1618
01:22:20,860 --> 01:22:22,228
Give me the gun.

1619
01:22:22,295 --> 01:22:24,330
Well, half a crown, then.

1620
01:22:24,398 --> 01:22:27,534
You know, money first.

1621
01:22:29,403 --> 01:22:31,738
Now, shall I put it in for you?

1622
01:22:31,805 --> 01:22:33,339
It breaks somewhere here.

1623
01:22:33,407 --> 01:22:36,042
I can't...
It's rather... Ha ha!

1624
01:22:36,109 --> 01:22:37,343
Perhaps I can manage.

1625
01:22:37,411 --> 01:22:38,845
Wait a minute.

1626
01:22:38,912 --> 01:22:40,847
I think you'll have
to do it yourself.

1627
01:22:40,914 --> 01:22:42,348
I'm not frightfully good.

1628
01:22:42,416 --> 01:22:44,050
Be rather careful, won't you?

1629
01:22:44,117 --> 01:22:45,719
You know, it goes off.

1630
01:22:51,357 --> 01:22:53,059
Got you again, my beauty.

1631
01:22:53,126 --> 01:22:54,360
My bird, I think, sir.

1632
01:22:54,428 --> 01:22:56,062
Could I have the doll, please?

1633
01:22:56,129 --> 01:22:57,764
What did you say?

1634
01:23:01,134 --> 01:23:02,469
Good shot, sir.

1635
01:23:02,536 --> 01:23:05,539
Well done. I'll
get you your doll.

1636
01:23:07,340 --> 01:23:09,409
Here you are, sir.

1637
01:23:09,476 --> 01:23:11,421
Now, then, who's going to shoot lovely
ducks? Come and shoot lovely ducks.

1638
01:23:11,445 --> 01:23:13,179
Would you like
to shoot lovely ducks?

1639
01:23:13,246 --> 01:23:15,381
Yes. I'd like half
a crown's worth, please.

1640
01:23:15,449 --> 01:23:16,883
Are you sure that's enough?

1641
01:23:16,950 --> 01:23:18,428
Oh, yes, certainly.
I don't need any more.

1642
01:23:18,452 --> 01:23:20,186
I very seldom miss.

1643
01:23:28,562 --> 01:23:30,396
Oh, got it at last.

1644
01:23:30,464 --> 01:23:32,198
Could I have the doll, please?

1645
01:23:32,265 --> 01:23:34,468
I'm sorry, sir,
but I'm afraid that's mine.

1646
01:23:34,534 --> 01:23:36,470
What did you say?

1647
01:23:36,536 --> 01:23:38,304
Nothing at all.

1648
01:23:38,371 --> 01:23:39,739
Could I have the doll, please?

1649
01:23:39,806 --> 01:23:42,208
Well done. I'll go
and get it for you.

1650
01:23:42,275 --> 01:23:44,911
It is really rather nice, I think,
to have won it, don't you?

1651
01:23:44,978 --> 01:23:47,413
You did earn it that time.

1652
01:23:47,481 --> 01:23:48,748
You know, they're lovely dolls.

1653
01:23:48,815 --> 01:23:49,616
They're fully dressed.
Fully.

1654
01:23:49,683 --> 01:23:51,485
Thank you very much.

1655
01:23:51,551 --> 01:23:53,987
Now who's going to come and
shoot lovely ducks over here

1656
01:23:54,053 --> 01:23:55,421
for only half a crown?

1657
01:23:55,489 --> 01:23:56,756
We're having such fun over here

1658
01:23:56,823 --> 01:23:59,325
shooting ducks
for only half a crown!

1659
01:25:29,348 --> 01:25:31,050
Eve!

1660
01:25:31,117 --> 01:25:32,552
Eve!

1661
01:26:25,304 --> 01:26:28,908
I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen.

1662
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:36,582
Doris. Doris!

1663
01:26:36,650 --> 01:26:38,351
Miss Tinsdale!

1664
01:26:38,417 --> 01:26:41,655
Come and give a hand here.

1665
01:26:42,989 --> 01:26:44,791
What are you waiting for?

1666
01:26:59,372 --> 01:27:00,940
I'm sorry, sir.

1667
01:27:14,353 --> 01:27:15,765
Do you think there's
anything between

1668
01:27:15,789 --> 01:27:17,623
Cooper and miss Inwood?

1669
01:27:17,691 --> 01:27:20,226
But Eve hasn't been
near for days.

1670
01:27:20,293 --> 01:27:22,395
Doris! Miss Tinsdale!

1671
01:27:22,461 --> 01:27:25,198
We got away as quickly
as possible, and here we are.

1672
01:27:25,264 --> 01:27:27,466
And that's the story
of the short and stormy life

1673
01:27:27,533 --> 01:27:29,235
of Doris Tinsdale.

1674
01:27:29,302 --> 01:27:30,804
It is in many respects
a sad one,

1675
01:27:30,870 --> 01:27:34,507
but, one hopes, not entirely
without usefulness.

1676
01:27:34,573 --> 01:27:36,351
The next thing, I suppose,
is to wait for the arrival

1677
01:27:36,375 --> 01:27:38,611
of Mr. ordinary Smith
with his posse

1678
01:27:38,678 --> 01:27:40,714
to arrest the whole
boiling lot of us.

1679
01:27:40,780 --> 01:27:41,991
Well, you think
I should give myself up?

1680
01:27:42,015 --> 01:27:44,818
Is that it? Yes,
I should, shouldn't I?

1681
01:27:44,884 --> 01:27:45,884
The longer I stay here,

1682
01:27:45,919 --> 01:27:47,821
the worse it will be for you.

1683
01:27:47,887 --> 01:27:49,188
But I won't give up.

1684
01:27:49,255 --> 01:27:51,891
There must be a way
to get at Charlotte.

1685
01:27:51,958 --> 01:27:55,528
I've made a nice hot toddy
for you, Mr. Robinson.

1686
01:27:55,594 --> 01:27:58,564
There's nothing like it
for a cold, is there?

1687
01:27:58,631 --> 01:27:59,665
Thank you.

1688
01:27:59,733 --> 01:28:01,267
Isn't it dreadful?

1689
01:28:01,334 --> 01:28:03,245
Poor Mr. Robinson hasn't been
able to stir out of his room

1690
01:28:03,269 --> 01:28:04,370
since he arrived.

1691
01:28:04,437 --> 01:28:06,672
These spring colds
are really frightful.

1692
01:28:06,740 --> 01:28:09,275
By the way, Eve,
Mr. Smith is downstairs

1693
01:28:09,342 --> 01:28:10,676
and wants to see you.

1694
01:28:10,744 --> 01:28:12,445
I think it would be
such a good idea

1695
01:28:12,511 --> 01:28:16,049
if I made Mr. Robinson
a nice, hot mustard plaster.

1696
01:28:16,115 --> 01:28:18,184
I wonder if he's got
a temperature.

1697
01:28:18,251 --> 01:28:20,086
Unfortunately,
I've broken my thermometer,

1698
01:28:20,153 --> 01:28:22,789
but you could easily
run round to the chemist's...

1699
01:28:39,472 --> 01:28:42,108
How long have you been
miss Inwood's maid?

1700
01:28:42,175 --> 01:28:44,043
Let me tell...
Because I think you know

1701
01:28:44,110 --> 01:28:46,350
we've been anxious to ask
Doris Tinsdale a few questions.

1702
01:28:46,379 --> 01:28:47,613
I can explain.

1703
01:28:47,680 --> 01:28:49,115
Did you talk to Jonathan Cooper

1704
01:28:49,182 --> 01:28:50,616
at the theater last night?

1705
01:28:50,683 --> 01:28:51,384
No.

1706
01:28:51,450 --> 01:28:53,319
Did you see him?

1707
01:28:53,386 --> 01:28:54,020
Yes.

1708
01:28:54,087 --> 01:28:55,388
Where?

1709
01:28:55,454 --> 01:28:58,357
On his way to miss
Inwood's dressing room.

1710
01:28:58,424 --> 01:29:01,127
He was there when she
went up to change.

1711
01:29:01,194 --> 01:29:03,196
I listened at the door
and overheard him

1712
01:29:03,262 --> 01:29:07,300
say something about a
bloodstained dress belonging to her.

1713
01:29:07,366 --> 01:29:09,969
And then suddenly,
she became afraid.

1714
01:29:10,036 --> 01:29:12,371
Do you hear? Afraid.

1715
01:29:12,438 --> 01:29:14,640
When you took sergeant
Loomis up to the dressing room,

1716
01:29:14,707 --> 01:29:16,642
you presumed Cooper
to be still there?

1717
01:29:16,709 --> 01:29:18,444
Well, I...
I didn't know.

1718
01:29:18,511 --> 01:29:21,747
You didn't know, but
you had a pretty fair idea.

1719
01:29:21,815 --> 01:29:24,150
Why didn't you tell Loomis?

1720
01:29:24,217 --> 01:29:26,452
Then you did
a very neat fainting fit,

1721
01:29:26,519 --> 01:29:29,923
which probably allowed
Cooper to get clear away.

1722
01:29:31,424 --> 01:29:33,359
Don't talk like that.

1723
01:29:33,426 --> 01:29:35,929
I can't bear it.

1724
01:29:40,733 --> 01:29:42,802
I don't understand it.

1725
01:29:44,370 --> 01:29:46,439
How could you behave like that?

1726
01:29:46,505 --> 01:29:48,341
But I can explain.

1727
01:29:48,407 --> 01:29:50,176
I don't think that's necessary.

1728
01:29:50,243 --> 01:29:52,611
In my job, I find a woman
goes to almost any length

1729
01:29:52,678 --> 01:29:54,981
to protect her lover.

1730
01:29:55,048 --> 01:29:56,682
But it's not like that.

1731
01:29:56,749 --> 01:29:58,852
It's not like that at all.

1732
01:29:58,918 --> 01:30:01,654
I thought I was
in love with Jonathan,

1733
01:30:01,720 --> 01:30:03,456
but I'm not anymore.

1734
01:30:03,522 --> 01:30:06,625
But it doesn't mean that
I still won't go on helping him

1735
01:30:06,692 --> 01:30:07,894
as I would any innocent man.

1736
01:30:07,961 --> 01:30:09,195
It's not for you to decide

1737
01:30:09,262 --> 01:30:10,663
whether he's innocent or not.

1738
01:30:10,729 --> 01:30:12,298
You can leave that to the law.

1739
01:30:12,365 --> 01:30:13,943
The point is, you put
yourself and your father

1740
01:30:13,967 --> 01:30:15,301
in a very serious position

1741
01:30:15,368 --> 01:30:18,437
by this infernal
amateur meddling.

1742
01:30:18,504 --> 01:30:20,673
How I'm going to get
you out of it,

1743
01:30:20,739 --> 01:30:22,141
I don't know.

1744
01:30:22,208 --> 01:30:25,611
But you do want to get us out?

1745
01:30:25,678 --> 01:30:27,446
In spite of the fact

1746
01:30:27,513 --> 01:30:30,449
you made such a fool
of me, you mean?

1747
01:30:30,516 --> 01:30:34,020
Your acting in the taxi
was extremely clever.

1748
01:30:38,224 --> 01:30:40,927
I wasn't acting in the taxi.

1749
01:30:42,295 --> 01:30:43,415
I fell in love with someone,

1750
01:30:43,462 --> 01:30:47,166
and all my plans
went out the window.

1751
01:30:47,233 --> 01:30:49,468
When we were
in the taxi together,

1752
01:30:49,535 --> 01:30:53,172
I felt as though I were
on a great golden cloud.

1753
01:30:53,239 --> 01:30:55,208
I told father I didn't
want to go on with this.

1754
01:30:55,274 --> 01:30:58,111
I wanted to tell you everything.

1755
01:30:58,177 --> 01:31:00,413
But he had an idea
about a bloodstained doll,

1756
01:31:00,479 --> 01:31:03,182
and I had to put it off.

1757
01:31:03,249 --> 01:31:06,352
I wanted to tell you
all about it.

1758
01:31:06,419 --> 01:31:08,687
Please believe me.

1759
01:31:11,590 --> 01:31:14,227
Would you like to mix a
cocktail yourself, Mr. Smith?

1760
01:31:14,293 --> 01:31:15,661
I'm afraid there's no ice,

1761
01:31:15,728 --> 01:31:18,464
but I'm sure you can manage.

1762
01:31:19,765 --> 01:31:21,300
Good evening, Smith.

1763
01:31:21,367 --> 01:31:22,501
Good evening.

1764
01:31:22,568 --> 01:31:24,770
Do I hear the muted
clanking of chains?

1765
01:31:24,837 --> 01:31:25,997
It's only the plumbing, dear.

1766
01:31:26,039 --> 01:31:27,640
It's in a dreadful state.

1767
01:31:27,706 --> 01:31:29,943
How did you enjoy the
garden party, Mr. Smith?

1768
01:31:30,009 --> 01:31:32,478
It must have been
awful in that rain.

1769
01:31:32,545 --> 01:31:34,880
I think I'll take some
Sherry up to Mr. Robinson.

1770
01:31:34,948 --> 01:31:37,216
I've quite changed
my mind about him.

1771
01:31:37,283 --> 01:31:39,518
He seems such a nice
young man after all.

1772
01:31:39,585 --> 01:31:42,989
Eve, dear, you will look
after Mr. Smith, won't you?

1773
01:31:44,757 --> 01:31:47,226
Father, I've been
explaining to Mr. Smith

1774
01:31:47,293 --> 01:31:49,228
what we're trying to do.

1775
01:31:49,295 --> 01:31:51,230
He thinks we ought to stop.

1776
01:31:51,297 --> 01:31:54,533
Oh, what a pity.
Just when you and I

1777
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:58,104
were about to save
Mr. Smith so much trouble.

1778
01:31:58,171 --> 01:31:59,472
Save me trouble?

1779
01:31:59,538 --> 01:32:01,240
Look here, sir.
You don't look like

1780
01:32:01,307 --> 01:32:02,208
an irresponsible imbecile.

1781
01:32:02,275 --> 01:32:03,542
Why behave like one?

1782
01:32:03,609 --> 01:32:05,087
What do you mean
by letting your daughter

1783
01:32:05,111 --> 01:32:06,455
get mixed up in
a business like this?

1784
01:32:06,479 --> 01:32:09,448
What sort of father
do you think you are?

1785
01:32:09,515 --> 01:32:10,549
Unique. Quite unique.

1786
01:32:10,616 --> 01:32:12,651
But rather broken-hearted
at this moment.

1787
01:32:12,718 --> 01:32:15,121
You see, I have another idea.

1788
01:32:15,188 --> 01:32:18,424
A pity to waste ideas, isn't it?

1789
01:32:18,491 --> 01:32:21,560
Have you ever been
blackmailed, Mr. Smith?

1790
01:32:21,627 --> 01:32:24,263
Well, I have,
only this afternoon,

1791
01:32:24,330 --> 01:32:26,132
at least my daughter and I were,

1792
01:32:26,199 --> 01:32:27,566
by Nellie Goode.

1793
01:32:27,633 --> 01:32:31,137
Yes, most inappropriate name.
I told her so.

1794
01:32:31,204 --> 01:32:33,272
She touched us for £24,

1795
01:32:33,339 --> 01:32:35,274
and, do you know, I think
it was well-spent?

1796
01:32:35,341 --> 01:32:36,909
Though we could ill afford it.

1797
01:32:36,976 --> 01:32:38,744
Come to the point, please.

1798
01:32:38,811 --> 01:32:41,747
Well, it struck me
that what Nellie could do,

1799
01:32:41,814 --> 01:32:43,416
Doris could do.

1800
01:32:43,482 --> 01:32:45,284
I mean, suppose she
went to miss Inwood

1801
01:32:45,351 --> 01:32:46,952
and said, "look, miss Inwood,

1802
01:32:47,020 --> 01:32:48,787
"I've got a certain dress
of yours.

1803
01:32:48,854 --> 01:32:52,591
It's ruined,
but it's still worth money."

1804
01:32:52,658 --> 01:32:55,228
And suppose miss Inwood
said, "all right.

1805
01:32:55,294 --> 01:32:57,796
I'll give you £100 for it."

1806
01:32:57,863 --> 01:32:59,232
What then, eh?

1807
01:32:59,298 --> 01:33:02,301
And suppose you happened
to be listening.

1808
01:33:02,368 --> 01:33:04,303
Well, that's what police do

1809
01:33:04,370 --> 01:33:06,239
in blackmail cases, isn't it?

1810
01:33:06,305 --> 01:33:09,308
What about it, eh?
What about it?

1811
01:33:09,375 --> 01:33:11,120
You needn't be afraid
that Doris couldn't do it.

1812
01:33:11,144 --> 01:33:13,412
She could do it all right,
Doris could.

1813
01:33:13,479 --> 01:33:15,281
I mean, Eve could.
She's a very good actress,

1814
01:33:15,348 --> 01:33:17,816
a very good actress indeed.

1815
01:33:17,883 --> 01:33:20,086
I'm sure she is.

1816
01:33:21,820 --> 01:33:22,921
By the way,

1817
01:33:22,988 --> 01:33:24,923
is there a bloodstained dress?

1818
01:33:24,990 --> 01:33:27,426
Well, no, no.
Not exactly.

1819
01:33:27,493 --> 01:33:30,429
Look, there was
a bloodstained dress, only...

1820
01:33:30,496 --> 01:33:33,432
Couldn't we tell you
all about that after...

1821
01:33:33,499 --> 01:33:35,168
I'm getting back to the office.

1822
01:33:35,234 --> 01:33:37,403
I'll let you know
about this later.

1823
01:33:41,006 --> 01:33:42,441
In the meantime,

1824
01:33:42,508 --> 01:33:44,443
what's miss Inwood
doing without her dresser?

1825
01:33:44,510 --> 01:33:46,079
You better run along
to the theater

1826
01:33:46,145 --> 01:33:49,182
before she starts
getting impatient.

1827
01:33:51,850 --> 01:33:53,286
It's all right.

1828
01:33:53,352 --> 01:33:54,463
What do you mean...
It's all right?

1829
01:33:54,487 --> 01:33:56,222
He's trying to save his face.

1830
01:33:56,289 --> 01:33:57,090
Not a bad face, either.

1831
01:33:57,156 --> 01:33:58,557
He'll let us do it.

1832
01:33:58,624 --> 01:34:02,061
What's the matter with you?
Aren't you pleased?

1833
01:34:02,128 --> 01:34:04,763
Come on.
We'd better hurry.

1834
01:34:04,830 --> 01:34:07,633
Come to Burton street at once
and bring two men with you.

1835
01:34:07,700 --> 01:34:09,635
Post them at either end
of the street.

1836
01:34:09,702 --> 01:34:12,405
I'll be waiting at the telephone
booth at the corner. All right?

1837
01:34:30,223 --> 01:34:32,858
Hello. Is that Mrs. Gill?

1838
01:34:32,925 --> 01:34:34,660
Is the commodore available?

1839
01:34:34,727 --> 01:34:38,164
Oh, he's gone out.
Is miss Eve there?

1840
01:34:38,231 --> 01:34:39,965
Oh, she's out, too.

1841
01:34:40,032 --> 01:34:44,137
One moment. May I speak
to Mr. Robinson, please?

1842
01:35:02,255 --> 01:35:04,190
What's the idea, governor?

1843
01:35:04,257 --> 01:35:07,092
Just a little
experiment. Plug it in.

1844
01:35:07,160 --> 01:35:08,461
O.K.

1845
01:35:22,775 --> 01:35:24,943
The Mike's in position.

1846
01:35:25,010 --> 01:35:27,646
I'm speaking about
3 foot from it.

1847
01:35:27,713 --> 01:35:29,215
Can you hear me?

1848
01:35:29,282 --> 01:35:31,917
Tell him the sound's all right.

1849
01:35:31,984 --> 01:35:33,852
O.K.

1850
01:35:35,988 --> 01:35:38,023
Do you think it'll work?

1851
01:35:38,090 --> 01:35:39,225
What a day, darling.

1852
01:35:39,292 --> 01:35:40,726
I've never in my whole life

1853
01:35:40,793 --> 01:35:42,828
been so glad to see
the end of it.

1854
01:35:42,895 --> 01:35:43,929
Yes, madam.

1855
01:35:43,996 --> 01:35:45,231
You must be tired, too.

1856
01:35:45,298 --> 01:35:47,233
It can't be easy to be a dresser

1857
01:35:47,300 --> 01:35:48,734
when you've had no experience.

1858
01:35:48,801 --> 01:35:51,804
But you're quite good,
very good, indeed.

1859
01:35:51,870 --> 01:35:55,040
Oh, that rain, that rain
at the garden party.

1860
01:35:55,107 --> 01:35:57,310
Thank goodness it didn't
rain at the funeral.

1861
01:35:57,376 --> 01:35:59,212
That would have been too much.

1862
01:35:59,278 --> 01:36:01,046
I hate rainy funerals.

1863
01:36:01,113 --> 01:36:04,183
And then somebody sent
up that disgusting doll.

1864
01:36:04,250 --> 01:36:07,953
What vermin some vermin are.

1865
01:36:08,020 --> 01:36:09,855
Yes, madam.

1866
01:36:09,922 --> 01:36:12,258
By the way, did
the police find you?

1867
01:36:12,325 --> 01:36:14,760
I haven't seen them yet, madam.

1868
01:36:14,827 --> 01:36:17,396
And anyway, I've got
nothing to tell them.

1869
01:36:17,463 --> 01:36:18,997
Well, I suppose that's all.

1870
01:36:19,064 --> 01:36:22,268
And that horrible Nellie
will be back tomorrow.

1871
01:36:22,335 --> 01:36:24,069
We may never see
each other again.

1872
01:36:24,136 --> 01:36:26,071
Ships that pass in
the something or other.

1873
01:36:26,138 --> 01:36:29,074
I like you. You're so
very sweet and patient.

1874
01:36:29,141 --> 01:36:31,744
I don't suppose I'm
easy to get on with.

1875
01:36:31,810 --> 01:36:32,810
Oh, but you are, madam.

1876
01:36:32,845 --> 01:36:35,381
It's been wonderful
working with you,

1877
01:36:35,448 --> 01:36:37,283
and I do love the theater so.

1878
01:36:37,350 --> 01:36:40,085
I don't see why. It's
an awful life, really.

1879
01:36:40,152 --> 01:36:43,121
Here, darling. A little
something extra for you.

1880
01:36:43,188 --> 01:36:44,490
I couldn't, madam, honestly.

1881
01:36:44,557 --> 01:36:46,225
Don't be an idiot.
Put it in the bank

1882
01:36:46,292 --> 01:36:48,193
or go out and get
drunk or something.

1883
01:36:48,261 --> 01:36:49,395
Thank you, madam.

1884
01:36:49,462 --> 01:36:50,739
Can I give you a lift somewhere?

1885
01:36:50,763 --> 01:36:52,173
If you would drop me,
I'd appreciate it.

1886
01:36:52,197 --> 01:36:54,433
All right, come along, then.

1887
01:37:16,889 --> 01:37:19,325
Miss Inwood, could I
talk to you in private?

1888
01:37:19,392 --> 01:37:21,035
We can talk in the car.
That's private enough.

1889
01:37:21,059 --> 01:37:22,099
Oh, no, no, that won't do.

1890
01:37:22,127 --> 01:37:23,596
I've got to talk to you now.

1891
01:37:23,662 --> 01:37:25,197
What's all this about?

1892
01:37:25,264 --> 01:37:28,601
Let's go some place
where nobody can hear us.

1893
01:37:32,104 --> 01:37:33,739
Have you gone mad or something?

1894
01:37:33,806 --> 01:37:36,275
No, madam.
I want to tell you

1895
01:37:36,342 --> 01:37:38,611
about the bloodstained doll.

1896
01:37:49,422 --> 01:37:51,357
Well, what about that doll?

1897
01:37:51,424 --> 01:37:53,926
Oh, I hate all this, madam.

1898
01:37:53,992 --> 01:37:55,361
I'm that nervous.

1899
01:37:55,428 --> 01:37:57,796
I'm so afraid of doing
the wrong thing.

1900
01:37:57,863 --> 01:38:00,533
You see, I happen to have
a dress that belongs to you

1901
01:38:00,599 --> 01:38:02,668
with a big bloodstain
down the front.

1902
01:38:02,735 --> 01:38:05,037
By rights, I know I
should go to the police,

1903
01:38:05,103 --> 01:38:07,706
but to tell you the
truth, madam, I'm afraid.

1904
01:38:07,773 --> 01:38:09,884
My dad would murder me if
I got my name in the papers.

1905
01:38:09,908 --> 01:38:11,977
So you see, I've come to you.

1906
01:38:12,044 --> 01:38:13,588
I thought maybe you
could tell me what to do.

1907
01:38:13,612 --> 01:38:15,514
How much do you want?

1908
01:38:15,581 --> 01:38:17,650
The thought of money never
entered my head, madam.

1909
01:38:17,716 --> 01:38:19,452
I hope you won't
think that of me.

1910
01:38:19,518 --> 01:38:21,119
Only if the dress
were clean like new,

1911
01:38:21,186 --> 01:38:24,523
it might be worth,
say, £75 or £100.

1912
01:38:24,590 --> 01:38:27,393
I know nothing about
a bloodstained dress.

1913
01:38:27,460 --> 01:38:30,396
This sounds to me
remarkably like blackmail.

1914
01:38:30,463 --> 01:38:32,264
I think I'd better
call the police.

1915
01:38:32,331 --> 01:38:34,767
Yes. Do call the police,
miss Inwood.

1916
01:38:34,833 --> 01:38:37,503
We'll talk to them together.

1917
01:38:38,637 --> 01:38:40,038
You're not a maid.

1918
01:38:40,105 --> 01:38:41,674
No, I'm not.

1919
01:38:42,975 --> 01:38:45,411
Why have you been
pretending all this time?

1920
01:38:45,478 --> 01:38:49,014
Shall we say we needed evidence?

1921
01:38:49,081 --> 01:38:52,585
We? Are you from the police?

1922
01:38:52,651 --> 01:38:55,888
Why was the bloodstain
smeared on the dress?

1923
01:38:57,122 --> 01:38:58,156
Who are you?

1924
01:38:58,223 --> 01:38:59,925
Why were you so frightened

1925
01:38:59,992 --> 01:39:02,072
when Jonathan told you he
hadn't destroyed the dress?

1926
01:39:02,127 --> 01:39:04,430
I don't know. I don't know
what you're talking about.

1927
01:39:04,497 --> 01:39:05,864
You do know!

1928
01:39:05,931 --> 01:39:10,235
Yes. Some blood did
splash on my dress.

1929
01:39:10,302 --> 01:39:11,370
I was there in the room

1930
01:39:11,437 --> 01:39:12,547
when Jonathan killed my husband.

1931
01:39:12,571 --> 01:39:13,772
That's not true.

1932
01:39:13,839 --> 01:39:15,484
Yes, it is, but I had
nothing to do with it.

1933
01:39:15,508 --> 01:39:17,376
Jonathan wanted
my name kept out of it.

1934
01:39:17,443 --> 01:39:18,944
He sent me back to his rooms.

1935
01:39:19,011 --> 01:39:21,780
He stayed behind to make it
look like robbery.

1936
01:39:21,847 --> 01:39:23,382
Then he brought me
a clean dress.

1937
01:39:23,449 --> 01:39:24,783
You're lying.

1938
01:39:24,850 --> 01:39:27,185
It's the sacred truth.
I swear to you it is.

1939
01:39:27,252 --> 01:39:29,888
Listen, whoever you are,
I'll give you anything

1940
01:39:29,955 --> 01:39:32,024
if you keep me
out of this. Anything.

1941
01:39:32,090 --> 01:39:34,660
My jewelry is worth over
£10,000. You can have it all.

1942
01:39:34,727 --> 01:39:36,962
And my furs or money.
How much do you want?

1943
01:39:37,029 --> 01:39:38,431
I'll give you anything.
Anything.

1944
01:39:38,497 --> 01:39:39,541
I'm going in now to break it up.

1945
01:39:39,565 --> 01:39:40,733
Bring him in.

1946
01:39:40,799 --> 01:39:42,801
I want the two of them together.

1947
01:39:42,868 --> 01:39:44,713
You deliberately tried to pin
the whole thing on Jonathan,

1948
01:39:44,737 --> 01:39:46,572
didn't you,

1949
01:39:46,639 --> 01:39:48,574
assisted by your friend
Mr. Freddie Williams.

1950
01:39:48,641 --> 01:39:50,342
It's not true, I tell
you. It's not true.

1951
01:39:50,409 --> 01:39:51,710
You won't get away with it.

1952
01:39:51,777 --> 01:39:53,111
I warn you, that's all.

1953
01:40:24,142 --> 01:40:25,511
I've had such a terrible scene

1954
01:40:25,578 --> 01:40:26,812
with a lunatic girl.

1955
01:40:26,879 --> 01:40:28,122
First she pretended
to be my dresser.

1956
01:40:28,146 --> 01:40:29,424
Then she pretended
to be a detective

1957
01:40:29,448 --> 01:40:30,749
and tried to blackmail me.

1958
01:40:30,816 --> 01:40:32,594
That's all right,
miss in wood. You stay here.

1959
01:40:32,618 --> 01:40:34,953
I'll have a word
with you in a minute.

1960
01:40:35,020 --> 01:40:37,923
Oh, good.
They got him.

1961
01:40:37,990 --> 01:40:41,627
Jonathan, what have
they done to you?

1962
01:40:41,694 --> 01:40:43,929
Why are you arresting him?

1963
01:40:43,996 --> 01:40:47,132
Mellish, stand by
miss Inwood there!

1964
01:40:47,199 --> 01:40:49,735
Heavens!
That must be Cooper.

1965
01:40:49,802 --> 01:40:51,637
Where's miss Inwood?

1966
01:40:51,704 --> 01:40:53,639
Cover the alleyway.

1967
01:40:53,706 --> 01:40:55,641
We think he used
an emergency door.

1968
01:40:55,708 --> 01:40:57,576
Where do those stairs lead to?

1969
01:40:57,643 --> 01:40:59,578
Eve! Eve, come back!

1970
01:40:59,645 --> 01:41:01,847
Where's the nearest telephone?

1971
01:41:01,914 --> 01:41:03,649
Eve!

1972
01:41:03,716 --> 01:41:05,851
Hurry up downstairs.

1973
01:41:05,918 --> 01:41:07,385
Go on. Hurry.

1974
01:41:07,452 --> 01:41:09,187
Get back into the theater.

1975
01:41:09,254 --> 01:41:12,157
Have you been told
to keep an eye on me?

1976
01:41:12,224 --> 01:41:14,660
In a manner of speaking, yes.

1977
01:41:14,727 --> 01:41:17,162
In that case, may I sit down?

1978
01:41:17,229 --> 01:41:19,164
No harm in that.

1979
01:41:19,231 --> 01:41:21,667
Get me a chair, then.

1980
01:41:21,734 --> 01:41:23,802
Surely, Ma'am.
Surely.

1981
01:41:23,869 --> 01:41:25,046
Done with the Mike?

1982
01:41:25,070 --> 01:41:26,071
Yes.

1983
01:41:26,138 --> 01:41:30,175
O.K. I wonder if they caught...

1984
01:41:35,047 --> 01:41:37,683
What's the point
of going up to the roof?

1985
01:41:37,750 --> 01:41:40,686
He may have doubled back
along the alley.

1986
01:41:40,753 --> 01:41:43,055
So they've heard
everything I said, hmm?

1987
01:41:43,121 --> 01:41:44,222
Yes.

1988
01:41:45,758 --> 01:41:48,193
And it's all in that book?

1989
01:41:48,260 --> 01:41:50,696
All in there, in shorthand.

1990
01:41:50,763 --> 01:41:52,965
How clever of you.

1991
01:41:54,767 --> 01:41:57,035
Things look bad
for me, don't they?

1992
01:41:57,102 --> 01:42:01,006
I'm what you'd call
an accessory,

1993
01:42:01,073 --> 01:42:02,708
I suppose.

1994
01:42:02,775 --> 01:42:04,710
George! Smith wants you

1995
01:42:04,777 --> 01:42:06,411
down at the stage
doorkeeper's office.

1996
01:42:06,478 --> 01:42:08,013
Thank you, darling.

1997
01:42:08,080 --> 01:42:11,216
We'll need more men
to cover all these rooms.

1998
01:42:11,283 --> 01:42:13,719
It's not all in there.

1999
01:42:13,786 --> 01:42:15,988
What's your name?

2000
01:42:16,054 --> 01:42:17,255
Mellish.

2001
01:42:19,792 --> 01:42:21,560
Do you like dogs, Mellish?

2002
01:42:21,627 --> 01:42:23,161
Yes, Ma'am, I do.

2003
01:42:23,228 --> 01:42:24,997
But not all dogs.

2004
01:42:25,063 --> 01:42:28,500
If they don't love you,
you don't love them.

2005
01:42:28,567 --> 01:42:30,302
That's right, isn't it?

2006
01:42:30,368 --> 01:42:31,303
I suppose so.

2007
01:42:31,369 --> 01:42:33,939
I had a dog once.

2008
01:42:34,006 --> 01:42:35,741
He hated me.

2009
01:42:35,808 --> 01:42:39,745
At last he bit me,
and I had him shot.

2010
01:42:39,812 --> 01:42:42,047
When I give all my love

2011
01:42:42,114 --> 01:42:45,751
and get back treachery
and hatred, it's...

2012
01:42:45,818 --> 01:42:50,322
It's as if my mother
had struck me in the face.

2013
01:42:53,125 --> 01:42:55,193
Do you understand that, Mellish?

2014
01:42:55,260 --> 01:42:57,996
I've heard it takes them
that way sometimes.

2015
01:42:59,765 --> 01:43:02,901
Yes. It takes
some of them that way.

2016
01:43:02,968 --> 01:43:04,536
Has miss Inwood
gone yet?

2017
01:43:04,603 --> 01:43:07,272
No, sir. She's still
in the theater.

2018
01:43:07,339 --> 01:43:09,307
I saw him run down the alley.

2019
01:43:09,374 --> 01:43:10,709
This is Smith, sir.

2020
01:43:10,776 --> 01:43:12,645
We're covering
the whole of the theater

2021
01:43:12,711 --> 01:43:15,080
from the roof right down
to the storeroom. Right, sir.

2022
01:43:15,147 --> 01:43:17,082
Look, you heard
what miss Inwood said.

2023
01:43:17,149 --> 01:43:18,827
You can't have anything
against young Cooper now.

2024
01:43:18,851 --> 01:43:20,786
Nothing, except murder.

2025
01:43:20,853 --> 01:43:22,788
He killed Charlotte's
husband, all right.

2026
01:43:22,855 --> 01:43:24,256
He's killed before.

2027
01:43:24,322 --> 01:43:25,791
What? What do you mean?

2028
01:43:25,858 --> 01:43:27,592
He got away with it last time

2029
01:43:27,660 --> 01:43:28,780
with a plea of self-defense.

2030
01:43:28,827 --> 01:43:30,996
He won't this time.
But Eve.

2031
01:43:31,063 --> 01:43:32,765
She's alone with him now.

2032
01:43:32,831 --> 01:43:34,900
Can't you see, sir?
She's in very great danger.

2033
01:43:50,382 --> 01:43:52,685
It all adds up
to a confession,

2034
01:43:52,751 --> 01:43:54,820
except she said you killed him.

2035
01:43:54,887 --> 01:43:56,121
Anyone in their right mind

2036
01:43:56,188 --> 01:43:57,990
could see that she
was telling a lie.

2037
01:43:58,056 --> 01:43:59,567
But I don't understand
why Smith arrested you.

2038
01:43:59,591 --> 01:44:01,226
What happened?

2039
01:44:01,293 --> 01:44:03,729
Somebody phoned and said
the police were on their way.

2040
01:44:03,796 --> 01:44:05,163
I made a bolt for it,

2041
01:44:05,230 --> 01:44:08,200
and they grabbed me
at the street door.

2042
01:44:08,266 --> 01:44:10,903
Funny, that... getting me
out into the street.

2043
01:44:10,969 --> 01:44:12,905
I suppose Smith didn't want me

2044
01:44:12,971 --> 01:44:14,707
to be caught in your house.

2045
01:44:14,773 --> 01:44:17,910
That would have been
awkward for you, wouldn't it?

2046
01:44:17,976 --> 01:44:19,587
I don't think they'll look
for us here for a bit.

2047
01:44:19,611 --> 01:44:20,913
After a little while,

2048
01:44:20,979 --> 01:44:23,081
maybe we can make a dash
through an emergency exit.

2049
01:44:23,148 --> 01:44:25,450
Eve. Eve.

2050
01:44:25,517 --> 01:44:28,653
Eve, wherever you are,
come away from him.

2051
01:44:28,721 --> 01:44:30,122
Come away from him.

2052
01:44:30,188 --> 01:44:32,791
He's dangerous.
He's a killer.

2053
01:44:32,858 --> 01:44:35,193
Eve. Eve.

2054
01:44:37,996 --> 01:44:39,932
He's right, you know.

2055
01:44:39,998 --> 01:44:42,768
Charlotte was telling the truth.

2056
01:44:45,037 --> 01:44:46,939
What she didn't tell you

2057
01:44:47,005 --> 01:44:48,941
was that she goaded me
into doing it.

2058
01:44:49,007 --> 01:44:51,944
She set me against him
in every way she could.

2059
01:44:52,010 --> 01:44:53,946
She made me think
she was crazy about me,

2060
01:44:54,012 --> 01:44:55,447
but she wasn't.

2061
01:44:55,513 --> 01:44:57,449
I was to kill her husband

2062
01:44:57,515 --> 01:44:58,884
to leave the coast clear

2063
01:44:58,951 --> 01:45:00,452
for that Freddie Williams.

2064
01:45:00,518 --> 01:45:01,954
I know that now.

2065
01:45:02,020 --> 01:45:04,790
She knew the sort of man I was.

2066
01:45:04,857 --> 01:45:06,892
She knows I can't control myself

2067
01:45:06,959 --> 01:45:08,794
if I get into a rage.

2068
01:45:08,861 --> 01:45:10,028
Like a fool, I told her

2069
01:45:10,095 --> 01:45:11,764
about that girl I'd killed.

2070
01:45:11,830 --> 01:45:14,466
Oh, Jonathan. Jonathan, you
don't know what you're saying.

2071
01:45:14,532 --> 01:45:15,968
I can't help it, Eve.

2072
01:45:16,034 --> 01:45:18,971
I can't control myself,
even when I was a kid.

2073
01:45:19,037 --> 01:45:21,273
I was lucky that last time.

2074
01:45:21,339 --> 01:45:23,976
The little fool
threatened me with a gun.

2075
01:45:24,042 --> 01:45:25,978
But you don't know
what it's like

2076
01:45:26,044 --> 01:45:28,280
to have a thing like
this hanging over you.

2077
01:45:28,346 --> 01:45:31,984
Eve, I hated to tell you
that phony story

2078
01:45:32,050 --> 01:45:33,986
in your car that time,

2079
01:45:34,052 --> 01:45:36,288
but there was no other way.

2080
01:45:36,354 --> 01:45:39,291
Charlotte did go on to my flat

2081
01:45:39,357 --> 01:45:41,293
after I'd killed her husband.

2082
01:45:41,359 --> 01:45:43,996
Her dress was stained a bit,

2083
01:45:44,062 --> 01:45:46,298
so I brought her a clean one.

2084
01:45:46,364 --> 01:45:49,001
Then when she went
to the theater,

2085
01:45:49,067 --> 01:45:51,003
I made a big stain on it

2086
01:45:51,069 --> 01:45:53,071
to make you believe me.

2087
01:45:53,138 --> 01:45:56,775
I'm telling you the truth now.

2088
01:46:01,279 --> 01:46:03,015
Jonathan...

2089
01:46:03,081 --> 01:46:07,319
I feel desperately
sorry for you.

2090
01:46:07,385 --> 01:46:09,021
Really, I do.

2091
01:46:09,087 --> 01:46:11,023
No, you don't.

2092
01:46:11,089 --> 01:46:13,325
You're not sorry at all.

2093
01:46:13,391 --> 01:46:16,494
You don't care
what happens to me.

2094
01:46:20,598 --> 01:46:22,534
Jonathan...

2095
01:46:22,600 --> 01:46:25,537
You could give yourself up.

2096
01:46:25,603 --> 01:46:27,339
They'd take care of you.

2097
01:46:27,405 --> 01:46:31,543
You couldn't do
all these things unless you...

2098
01:46:31,609 --> 01:46:34,046
Unless...

2099
01:46:34,112 --> 01:46:37,049
They can't do anything
to a sick man,

2100
01:46:37,115 --> 01:46:39,251
and that's what you are.

2101
01:46:39,317 --> 01:46:41,186
You must be.

2102
01:46:41,253 --> 01:46:43,355
No. They're going to hang me.

2103
01:46:43,421 --> 01:46:46,391
They'll hang Charlotte,
too, for planning it.

2104
01:46:46,458 --> 01:46:48,060
They've never forgiven me

2105
01:46:48,126 --> 01:46:50,195
for getting away with it
the first time.

2106
01:46:50,262 --> 01:46:53,065
There's nothing wrong
with my mind.

2107
01:46:53,131 --> 01:46:56,334
Nobody can prove
that there is, unless...

2108
01:47:06,378 --> 01:47:09,581
Unless I do it a third time,

2109
01:47:09,647 --> 01:47:12,384
with no reason whatever.

2110
01:47:12,450 --> 01:47:17,822
That would be a
clear case of insanity,

2111
01:47:17,890 --> 01:47:19,858
wouldn't it?

2112
01:47:23,661 --> 01:47:25,497
Wouldn't it?

2113
01:47:37,375 --> 01:47:38,776
Jonathan,

2114
01:47:38,843 --> 01:47:41,613
Jonathan, I don't
hear a sound now.

2115
01:47:41,679 --> 01:47:44,116
I think we can go now.

2116
01:47:44,182 --> 01:47:47,119
We'll go out
through the orchestra pit,

2117
01:47:47,185 --> 01:47:50,388
and then I'll take you
to my father's boat.

2118
01:47:52,690 --> 01:47:54,592
Come along.

2119
01:48:21,719 --> 01:48:23,922
Here he is!

2120
01:48:25,723 --> 01:48:29,161
Look!
In the orchestra pit!

2121
01:48:31,930 --> 01:48:36,668
Mathews, quick!
Down in the orchestra.

2122
01:48:42,674 --> 01:48:44,242
They've got to him!

2123
01:48:44,309 --> 01:48:45,377
Where?

2124
01:48:45,443 --> 01:48:46,644
They found him.
Where was he?

2125
01:48:46,718 --> 01:48:48,820
He was in the theater after all.

2126
01:48:48,880 --> 01:48:52,117
Call Smith! He was at the
stage door keeper's office.

2127
01:48:52,184 --> 01:48:53,918
Drop the iron curtain
and cut him off!

2128
01:48:53,986 --> 01:48:56,254
Get out of the way!

2129
01:49:06,498 --> 01:49:09,501
Take the curtain up.
Don't touch anything.

2130
01:49:09,567 --> 01:49:13,205
Mellish, you'd better
phone up the photographer.

2131
01:49:13,271 --> 01:49:15,707
Someone find out
if Byard's here yet,

2132
01:49:15,773 --> 01:49:17,976
and tell him what's happened.
