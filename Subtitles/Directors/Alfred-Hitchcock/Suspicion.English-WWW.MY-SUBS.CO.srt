1
00:01:09,343 --> 00:01:13,540
I beg your pardon. Was that your leg?
I had no idea we were going into a tunnel.

2
00:01:13,613 --> 00:01:15,477
I thought the compartment was empty.

3
00:01:19,317 --> 00:01:21,807
I'm so sorry. I hope I didn't hurt you.

4
00:01:22,685 --> 00:01:25,380
Awful man in the next compartment
smoking a vile cigar.

5
00:01:26,454 --> 00:01:29,445
I had to come in here.
You don't smoke, do you?

6
00:01:29,523 --> 00:01:32,116
- No, I don't.
- Thank heavens for that.

7
00:01:32,191 --> 00:01:36,126
After last night, my head couldn't
stand it. You understand...

8
00:01:45,866 --> 00:01:48,164
May I see your tickets, please?

9
00:01:54,839 --> 00:01:55,965
Thank you, miss.

10
00:01:57,874 --> 00:02:00,206
I'm afraid
you're in the wrong compartment, sir.

11
00:02:00,277 --> 00:02:02,267
- It's a first-class compartment, isn't it?
- Yes.

12
00:02:02,345 --> 00:02:04,437
- Then I'm all right.
- It's a third-class ticket.

13
00:02:07,214 --> 00:02:10,910
What sort of line is this, selling
third-class tickets at first-class prices?

14
00:02:10,984 --> 00:02:12,610
I am very sorry, sir.

15
00:02:12,684 --> 00:02:15,675
That will be Â£5.04 extra.

16
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,387
- You haven't change for a fiver, have you?
- Yes, sir.

17
00:02:18,455 --> 00:02:21,184
Don't bother, because I haven't got one.

18
00:02:25,293 --> 00:02:27,317
This is the best I can do.

19
00:02:27,427 --> 00:02:30,987
Do you suppose the line would settle for
Â£5 and tuppence ha'penny?

20
00:02:33,465 --> 00:02:35,160
No, I don't suppose they would.

21
00:02:40,436 --> 00:02:43,768
I hate to presume on our short
acquaintance, but have you any change?

22
00:02:44,338 --> 00:02:46,704
I'm afraid that I...

23
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:51,202
There you are. That'll do. That stamp.

24
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,771
Thank you very much.

25
00:02:53,845 --> 00:02:57,143
There you are, Â£5 and tuppence ha'penny
and three ha'pence. Â£5.04.

26
00:02:59,348 --> 00:03:01,475
It's legal tender, old boy.

27
00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:06,950
Write to your mother.

28
00:03:09,822 --> 00:03:10,913
That man.

29
00:03:44,145 --> 00:03:46,237
Mr. Aysgarth, may I?

30
00:03:46,312 --> 00:03:49,940
Would you mind stepping forward
a little bit, Mrs. Fitzpatrick? Thank you.

31
00:03:50,015 --> 00:03:52,039
Now, Mr. Aysgarth, please.

32
00:03:53,584 --> 00:03:56,643
I wonder if I could have
a little bit more of your smile?

33
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,051
Not at this hour of the morning.

34
00:04:00,055 --> 00:04:02,353
- There he is. Good morning, Johnnie.
- How are you?

35
00:04:02,424 --> 00:04:04,789
- We've been looking for you everywhere.
- Everywhere.

36
00:04:04,858 --> 00:04:07,724
Excuse me.
If it's possible at all, would you mind?

37
00:04:07,794 --> 00:04:10,887
Of course. I'm so sorry.
See you later, Johnnie. Goodbye.

38
00:04:10,962 --> 00:04:14,260
- Come, Alice. Come, Jessie.
- Thank you very much.

39
00:04:14,331 --> 00:04:17,265
Aren't they bright this morning? Now.

40
00:04:17,332 --> 00:04:19,562
That's very good.

41
00:04:19,635 --> 00:04:23,001
Now could I have a little bit of a smile?
You remember.

42
00:04:33,944 --> 00:04:36,707
I can hardly believe it.
It can't be the same girl.

43
00:04:38,547 --> 00:04:40,344
What's her name? Do you know her?

44
00:04:40,415 --> 00:04:44,281
Yes, but lay off, Johnnie.
You've enough on your hands for one day.

45
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,544
Besides, she's not up your alley.

46
00:04:46,618 --> 00:04:49,814
To tell you the truth,
I'm a little bored with people in my alley.

47
00:04:49,887 --> 00:04:52,082
- Introduce me to her, will you?
- Certainly not.

48
00:04:52,156 --> 00:04:54,146
She's a very carefully brought up
young lady.

49
00:04:54,224 --> 00:04:56,282
If you won't do it, I'll
have to do it myself.

50
00:04:56,358 --> 00:04:57,620
Come on, they're going.

51
00:05:22,843 --> 00:05:25,902
- Lina, may we come in?
- I'm sorry. I didn't see you.

52
00:05:25,978 --> 00:05:28,070
- How are you?
- Splendid.

53
00:05:29,547 --> 00:05:31,741
May I introduce Mr. Aysgarth?

54
00:05:35,284 --> 00:05:36,910
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

55
00:05:36,985 --> 00:05:39,418
We were just passing by
and we saw you in the window.

56
00:05:39,487 --> 00:05:42,284
- Johnnie insisted on meeting you.
- Why?

57
00:05:42,355 --> 00:05:44,459
I'm told the sight of a
really eligible male

58
00:05:44,472 --> 00:05:46,586
is a rare treat in this
part of the country.

59
00:05:46,992 --> 00:05:49,585
- Isn't Johnnie terrible?
- He's too fantastic for words.

60
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,785
Aren't you, Johnnie?

61
00:05:51,962 --> 00:05:54,759
- Hadn't you better hurry?
- Hurry for what?

62
00:05:55,197 --> 00:05:56,959
You don't want to be late for church.

63
00:05:57,031 --> 00:06:00,659
- Did you all come to take me to church?
- No, but that is...

64
00:06:00,734 --> 00:06:03,600
- If you want to come...
- Naturally, we'd love to have you.

65
00:06:04,637 --> 00:06:07,571
That's very kind of you.
I think I will come.

66
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:12,165
Good. And put on that saucy little hat
you wore on the train the other day.

67
00:06:12,242 --> 00:06:15,574
I will. Excuse me.
I'll be down in a moment.

68
00:06:15,911 --> 00:06:18,071
We'd better sit down, girls.

69
00:06:35,724 --> 00:06:37,782
- Where are you rushing to?
- To church, Mother.

70
00:06:37,858 --> 00:06:39,498
- But I thought...
- I've changed my mind.

71
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,050
- Shall I go with you?
- I'm going with the Barhams.

72
00:06:42,128 --> 00:06:44,493
- I thought you didn't like them.
- I loathe them.

73
00:06:47,732 --> 00:06:49,528
Really, it's most extraordinary.

74
00:07:16,651 --> 00:07:19,619
- You're not really going to church?
- I certainly am.

75
00:07:19,686 --> 00:07:22,848
- No, you're coming for a walk with me.
- Don't be ridiculous.

76
00:07:22,922 --> 00:07:26,448
Tell you what I'll do, I'll toss you
for it. Heads you do, tails you don't.

77
00:07:31,494 --> 00:07:32,687
Mother.

78
00:07:44,202 --> 00:07:47,432
Now what did you think
I was trying to do, kill you?

79
00:07:47,504 --> 00:07:50,563
Nothing less than murder could justify
such violent self-defense.

80
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,072
- Look at you.
- Let me go.

81
00:07:54,542 --> 00:07:58,102
I'm just beginning to understand.
You thought I was going to kiss you.

82
00:07:58,178 --> 00:08:00,338
- Weren't you?
- Of course not.

83
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:03,313
I was merely reaching around you,
trying to fix your hair.

84
00:08:03,381 --> 00:08:06,611
- What's wrong with my hair?
- I'm glad you asked me that.

85
00:08:06,684 --> 00:08:10,084
It would have been very discourteous
for me to bring the subject up.

86
00:08:10,153 --> 00:08:13,019
- Are you serious?
- Of course I'm serious.

87
00:08:13,654 --> 00:08:17,145
I may seem provincial, but frankly,
I can't understand men like you.

88
00:08:17,224 --> 00:08:20,215
You always give me the feeling
that you're laughing at me.

89
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,290
No, I give you my word.

90
00:08:23,361 --> 00:08:25,021
But your hair's all wrong.

91
00:08:25,095 --> 00:08:28,552
It has such wonderful possibilities
that I got excited.

92
00:08:28,965 --> 00:08:32,195
For the moment,
I became a passionate hairdresser.

93
00:08:32,267 --> 00:08:34,996
- What's wrong with it?
- Let me show you.

94
00:08:36,803 --> 00:08:38,168
Let me see...

95
00:08:40,038 --> 00:08:42,199
- Don't do that.
- Why not?

96
00:08:42,673 --> 00:08:45,539
Because your ucipital mapilary
is quite beautiful.

97
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:48,043
What's an ucipital mapilary?

98
00:08:50,179 --> 00:08:52,612
- That.
- You don't need to touch it.

99
00:08:54,381 --> 00:08:55,712
Let's see.

100
00:08:56,783 --> 00:08:58,181
That's good.

101
00:09:04,388 --> 00:09:07,185
I must be quite a novelty
by contrast with the women...

102
00:09:07,257 --> 00:09:08,848
that you're photographed with.

103
00:09:10,792 --> 00:09:13,624
What do you think of me
by contrast to your horse?

104
00:09:13,694 --> 00:09:18,288
If I ever got the bit between your teeth,
I'd have no trouble in handling you at all.

105
00:09:19,531 --> 00:09:22,055
Suppose just as you thought
you had me under control...

106
00:09:22,133 --> 00:09:24,259
I turned around, neighed, and kissed you?

107
00:09:24,334 --> 00:09:26,597
I think you've done enough fooling
with my hair.

108
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:33,003
You don't look very good like that.

109
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,666
You look more like a monkey
with a bit of mirror.

110
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:38,574
What does your family call you?
Monkeyface?

111
00:09:40,512 --> 00:09:42,775
I still think my way was best.

112
00:09:48,117 --> 00:09:50,710
I must go now or I'll be late to luncheon.

113
00:09:50,785 --> 00:09:54,550
If my father saw me come in both late
and beautiful, he might have a stroke.

114
00:10:05,595 --> 00:10:09,223
- Please don't bother to come any further.
- I'll be back for you at 3:00.

115
00:10:09,298 --> 00:10:11,836
No, really, I can't
come out this afternoon.

116
00:10:11,849 --> 00:10:12,698
Yes, you can.

117
00:10:12,767 --> 00:10:15,633
No, really,
I have to make calls with my mother.

118
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,527
- Liar.
- Really.

119
00:10:18,103 --> 00:10:20,036
Don't forget, 3:00.

120
00:10:21,406 --> 00:10:23,839
Lina will never marry.
She's not the marrying sort.

121
00:10:23,907 --> 00:10:24,930
She has no need to worry.

122
00:10:25,007 --> 00:10:27,339
There's enough to care for her
the rest of her life.

123
00:10:27,409 --> 00:10:30,571
I suppose you're right, dear.
I'm afraid she's rather spinsterish.

124
00:10:30,644 --> 00:10:33,840
What's wrong with that?
The old maid's a respectable institution.

125
00:10:33,913 --> 00:10:37,973
All women are not alike. Lina has intellect
and a fine solid character.

126
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,277
Come on, I'm hungry.

127
00:11:06,001 --> 00:11:07,229
Sorry I'm late.

128
00:11:10,404 --> 00:11:12,462
Could I have some well-done,
please, Burton?

129
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:13,631
Yes, miss.

130
00:11:13,707 --> 00:11:15,697
What kept you so long at church, dear?

131
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:20,701
I didn't go to church.
I went for a walk. Thank you, Burton.

132
00:11:21,712 --> 00:11:23,474
- With a man.
- A man?

133
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,643
Yes. His name's John Aysgarth.

134
00:11:26,881 --> 00:11:29,713
- John Aysgarth?
- Is that Tom Aysgarth's boy?

135
00:11:29,783 --> 00:11:31,511
How'd you meet him?

136
00:11:31,584 --> 00:11:34,643
Pity he's turned out so wild.
Rough luck on Tom.

137
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,382
What's this, horseradish?
Didn't know horseradish was in season.

138
00:11:38,456 --> 00:11:41,288
- It's not out of a bottle, is it?
- Of course not, dear.

139
00:11:41,358 --> 00:11:43,484
That's real.
I can tell the difference at once.

140
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:46,527
I can't stand things out of bottles.
They never taste the same.

141
00:11:46,594 --> 00:11:47,993
Never, dear.

142
00:11:48,529 --> 00:11:51,361
Why did you say
that John Aysgarth was wild, Father?

143
00:11:51,431 --> 00:11:54,558
He was turned out of some club
for cheating at cards, wasn't he?

144
00:11:56,701 --> 00:11:59,032
I don't know. I didn't ask him.

145
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:01,696
Or ought to have been.
Something unpleasant anyway.

146
00:12:01,771 --> 00:12:04,534
- What's he doing down here?
- Staying at Penshaze.

147
00:12:04,606 --> 00:12:06,505
Lord Middleham
wouldn't have him there...

148
00:12:06,574 --> 00:12:08,838
if he had been turned out of a club
for cheating.

149
00:12:08,909 --> 00:12:11,809
Maybe it wasn't cards. Maybe a woman.

150
00:12:12,212 --> 00:12:14,441
He was corespondent or something,
I believe...

151
00:12:14,513 --> 00:12:16,104
or ought to have been corespondent.

152
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:19,012
You can't expect me to remember
every detail about everybody.

153
00:12:19,082 --> 00:12:23,279
Anyway, I'm going to see him again.
He's calling for me this afternoon at 3:00.

154
00:12:27,521 --> 00:12:29,818
You're wanted on the telephone, miss.

155
00:12:38,595 --> 00:12:39,789
Hello?

156
00:12:40,163 --> 00:12:41,391
Hello, Johnnie.

157
00:12:42,631 --> 00:12:43,962
You can't?

158
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:49,194
Of course, I understand.

159
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,534
Thank you for calling.

160
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:56,199
I'd love to,
next time you come down again.

161
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,024
Hello?

162
00:13:33,398 --> 00:13:35,922
Is Mr. John Aysgarth there, please?

163
00:13:36,933 --> 00:13:38,195
He isn't?

164
00:13:38,535 --> 00:13:40,525
I thought perhaps...

165
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:43,632
Are you expecting him for the Hunt Ball?

166
00:13:44,439 --> 00:13:48,306
This is... It doesn't matter.
I'll ring again.

167
00:13:50,409 --> 00:13:53,104
- Nothing, Miss McLaidlaw.
- Are you sure?

168
00:13:54,411 --> 00:13:57,243
- Positive.
- I don't want to be a nuisance...

169
00:13:57,313 --> 00:14:01,009
but couldn't it accidentally have been
put into somebody else's letter box?

170
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:04,643
I'm sorry, I'm sure it would have been
returned if that had happened.

171
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:06,048
Thank you.

172
00:14:16,059 --> 00:14:18,185
Regent 0021, please.

173
00:14:24,098 --> 00:14:25,395
No reply?

174
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:27,730
Thank you.

175
00:14:57,186 --> 00:14:59,210
- Lina.
- Hello, Mother.

176
00:15:01,822 --> 00:15:03,187
It's 7:00.

177
00:15:04,824 --> 00:15:06,883
Aren't you going to wear your new dress?

178
00:15:07,359 --> 00:15:09,691
No, Mother. I'm not in the mood.

179
00:15:10,194 --> 00:15:13,253
- What's the matter, dear?
- My head's splitting.

180
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:16,522
I'm not going to the ball.

181
00:15:16,966 --> 00:15:20,423
Not going? You mean...
What'll your father say?

182
00:15:20,702 --> 00:15:22,669
Perhaps some aspirin...

183
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:26,636
- You haven't a temperature, have you?
- I don't know.

184
00:15:26,706 --> 00:15:27,865
Yes, come in.

185
00:15:28,773 --> 00:15:31,707
- Where's your aspirin? I'll get it.
- In my bureau drawer.

186
00:15:32,276 --> 00:15:34,903
- A telegram for you, miss.
- Thank you.

187
00:16:02,996 --> 00:16:05,294
- Here's the aspirin, dear.
- What for?

188
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:07,624
- Your headache.
- That's gone.

189
00:16:07,699 --> 00:16:12,066
- Tell Father I'll be down in a second.
- Really, I don't understand you.

190
00:16:57,399 --> 00:16:58,956
I say, Lina.

191
00:16:59,733 --> 00:17:01,962
- Yes, Reggie?
- What about our dance?

192
00:17:02,035 --> 00:17:05,128
- Why, of course. Poor Reggie.
- Good.

193
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:14,475
I say, General, that's not Lina
dancing with Wetherby, is it?

194
00:17:14,543 --> 00:17:17,875
- Yes, it is.
- By Jove, I didn't recognize her at first.

195
00:17:17,946 --> 00:17:19,879
I hardly knew her myself.

196
00:17:19,947 --> 00:17:22,244
There's somebody at the door
for General McLaidlaw.

197
00:17:22,315 --> 00:17:26,410
There's somebody to see you at the door.
This is General McLaidlaw.

198
00:17:26,484 --> 00:17:27,882
I beg your pardon, sir.

199
00:17:27,952 --> 00:17:30,943
There's a gentleman at the door
who says he's with your party.

200
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,852
He has no card, sir. The name is Aysgarth.

201
00:17:34,256 --> 00:17:36,746
Aysgarth? Must be a mistake.

202
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:41,985
General McLaidlaw? I'm John Aysgarth.

203
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:45,954
I don't recall having invited you
in my party.

204
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:48,394
How awkward. I thought you had.

205
00:17:48,465 --> 00:17:51,058
Otherwise I should never have come
all the way from London.

206
00:17:52,134 --> 00:17:53,657
I don't know what to say.

207
00:17:53,735 --> 00:17:56,999
I suggest you say something before
you embarrass this poor man to death.

208
00:18:02,674 --> 00:18:04,232
- Hello, Johnnie.
- Hello, Lina.

209
00:18:04,309 --> 00:18:07,004
- Hello, Johnnie.
- We were wondering if you were coming.

210
00:18:07,078 --> 00:18:09,875
I'm sorry I'm late.
I believe this is our dance, isn't it?

211
00:18:19,286 --> 00:18:21,344
- Hello, Monkeyface.
- Hello.

212
00:18:45,136 --> 00:18:47,194
But we can't do this. Where are we going?

213
00:18:47,271 --> 00:18:50,000
- Which is your car?
- This is ridiculous.

214
00:18:50,506 --> 00:18:52,632
- Over there.
- Good. Come on.

215
00:18:55,909 --> 00:18:57,876
Roll up the window before you catch cold.

216
00:19:09,184 --> 00:19:12,016
Have you ever been kissed in a car before?

217
00:19:12,253 --> 00:19:14,278
- Johnnie.
- Johnnie what?

218
00:19:14,722 --> 00:19:17,690
You mustn't joke with me.
I'm no good at joking.

219
00:19:17,757 --> 00:19:20,555
- I don't know how to flirt.
- I'm not joking. I'm serious.

220
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:23,526
- Have you ever been kissed in a car?
- Never.

221
00:19:29,398 --> 00:19:31,195
Would you like to be?

222
00:19:32,034 --> 00:19:33,091
Yes.

223
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:48,508
You're the first woman I've ever met
who said yes when she meant yes.

224
00:19:48,577 --> 00:19:52,205
- What do the others say?
- Hanged if I know. Anything but yes.

225
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,804
- But they kiss you?
- Usually.

226
00:19:55,748 --> 00:19:58,841
- Have there...
- Have there what, Monkeyface?

227
00:19:59,651 --> 00:20:03,017
- Have there been many?
- I'm afraid so. Quite a few.

228
00:20:03,621 --> 00:20:06,589
One night, when I couldn't fall asleep,
I started to count them.

229
00:20:06,656 --> 00:20:09,249
The way you count sheep
jumping over a fence.

230
00:20:09,325 --> 00:20:11,758
I think I passed out on number 73.

231
00:20:13,061 --> 00:20:17,052
- Are you always frank with them like this?
- No, not particularly.

232
00:20:17,563 --> 00:20:20,429
Why are you frank with me,
because I'm different?

233
00:20:20,498 --> 00:20:22,192
No, it isn't that.

234
00:20:22,266 --> 00:20:26,531
I'm honest because with you
I think it's the best way to get results.

235
00:20:29,004 --> 00:20:33,520
I hope I'm not saying the wrong thing,
but I love you.

236
00:20:35,809 --> 00:20:38,972
No, you haven't said
the wrong thing, Monkeyface.

237
00:20:40,246 --> 00:20:43,181
- Where are we going?
- I don't know, anywhere.

238
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:47,213
I think I'm falling in love with you
and I don't quite like it.

239
00:20:47,285 --> 00:20:49,413
That's why I stayed away from you
for a week.

240
00:20:49,488 --> 00:20:50,784
I was afraid of you.

241
00:20:52,324 --> 00:20:54,450
I didn't think it would happen like this.

242
00:20:54,525 --> 00:20:57,517
Neither did I.
I saw an entirely different sort of person.

243
00:20:57,595 --> 00:21:00,358
- So did I.
- I pictured it all rather conventionally.

244
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:03,558
We'd meet at a garden party,
he'd call on me in the evenings...

245
00:21:03,633 --> 00:21:07,069
and we'd go for rides together,
and then afterward we'd...

246
00:21:07,137 --> 00:21:10,037
We're coming to my house.
Would you like to stop for a drink?

247
00:21:10,106 --> 00:21:11,130
No.

248
00:21:11,507 --> 00:21:15,237
I'm going to get you back to that ball
as fast as possible.

249
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:24,778
Get out.

250
00:21:29,155 --> 00:21:30,952
Why have you stopped?

251
00:21:31,257 --> 00:21:33,157
I'm sure I don't know.

252
00:21:34,727 --> 00:21:35,989
Come on.

253
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:45,234
- Good evening, Burton.
- I saw you coming up the drive, miss.

254
00:21:45,303 --> 00:21:47,964
We won't be needing you.
We just stopped in for a drink.

255
00:21:48,038 --> 00:21:49,972
- Very good.
- Shall we go in the study?

256
00:21:52,542 --> 00:21:56,103
You sit down. I'll mix you a drink.
I think you need one.

257
00:21:58,014 --> 00:21:59,879
You must be made of iron.

258
00:21:59,948 --> 00:22:01,779
- Why?
- How can you be so calm?

259
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:03,818
Look at me. I'm shaking.

260
00:22:04,019 --> 00:22:08,183
- The least you could do is swoon away.
- I know. I'm rather surprised myself.

261
00:22:08,923 --> 00:22:11,756
I think it's because
for the first time in my life...

262
00:22:11,826 --> 00:22:13,555
I know what I want.

263
00:22:29,641 --> 00:22:31,439
Are you courting me?

264
00:22:33,411 --> 00:22:35,002
I'm afraid I am.

265
00:22:36,581 --> 00:22:38,673
This is a wonderful moment.

266
00:22:39,516 --> 00:22:42,974
Here we are in my home,
the house that I was born in...

267
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:47,285
alone and together in my favorite room.

268
00:22:47,723 --> 00:22:49,588
Do you like this room?

269
00:22:50,092 --> 00:22:51,423
Very much.

270
00:22:56,565 --> 00:22:58,795
Well, what are you doing here?

271
00:23:02,703 --> 00:23:05,263
I say, old boy,
isn't that going a bit too far?

272
00:23:08,209 --> 00:23:09,836
- He doesn't like me.
- I know.

273
00:23:12,912 --> 00:23:15,971
He doesn't trust me from here to there.
Do you?

274
00:23:16,648 --> 00:23:20,914
You're right. Stop it before it's too late.
Tell her everything you're thinking.

275
00:23:21,453 --> 00:23:24,717
That I'm no good to her,
I can only bring her unhappiness.

276
00:23:24,789 --> 00:23:27,690
Warn her. Speak up, man.
It's your last chance.

277
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,521
Hear him?

278
00:23:30,961 --> 00:23:32,589
Very distinctly.

279
00:23:33,197 --> 00:23:37,997
He's not exaggerating a thing, dear.
It's all true, every word he isn't saying.

280
00:23:39,134 --> 00:23:40,864
I love him, Father.

281
00:23:41,571 --> 00:23:43,765
- Did you see him jump?
- I did.

282
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:49,868
Watch this one.

283
00:23:51,446 --> 00:23:55,678
Sir, I have the honor of asking
for your daughter's hand in marriage.

284
00:23:57,518 --> 00:23:59,509
What do you say to that?

285
00:24:05,092 --> 00:24:07,616
You heard him that time, didn't you?

286
00:24:08,561 --> 00:24:10,586
It doesn't matter.

287
00:24:11,963 --> 00:24:13,556
Poor Monkeyface.

288
00:24:20,905 --> 00:24:22,770
Do you hear the music?

289
00:24:22,973 --> 00:24:24,463
Very clearly.

290
00:24:26,075 --> 00:24:29,738
Let's dance, before I... Before we...

291
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,878
Let's dance.

292
00:25:19,122 --> 00:25:21,589
I was just going down to the post.

293
00:25:22,525 --> 00:25:25,961
Could you stop at Marshall's
and get me more of this green wool?

294
00:25:26,028 --> 00:25:27,654
Where'd I put it?

295
00:25:31,299 --> 00:25:32,699
Here it is.

296
00:25:33,068 --> 00:25:37,026
Be sure it's the same green.
Better take it out into the daylight.

297
00:25:37,104 --> 00:25:38,504
Yes, Mother.

298
00:25:44,744 --> 00:25:48,771
- Is there anything I can do for you?
- No, there's nothing I want.

299
00:26:10,301 --> 00:26:12,427
Don't be late for tea, dear.

300
00:27:04,814 --> 00:27:06,611
That trunk goes up on the landing.

301
00:27:08,284 --> 00:27:10,581
How do you like it, Mrs. Aysgarth?

302
00:27:10,652 --> 00:27:13,120
If you don't like it,
just blame it all on Mr. Bailey.

303
00:27:13,188 --> 00:27:16,021
He rented it during our honeymoon.
He decorated the place.

304
00:27:16,091 --> 00:27:17,391
But if you do like it...

305
00:27:17,404 --> 00:27:20,026
- I adore it. I'm mad about it.
It's wonderful.

306
00:27:20,094 --> 00:27:22,119
In that case,
you're talking to the right man.

307
00:27:22,196 --> 00:27:24,185
Because I engaged Mr.
Bailey, didn't I?

308
00:27:24,198 --> 00:27:26,393
Yes, Mr. Aysgarth.
That's true, I must say.

309
00:27:26,466 --> 00:27:28,127
Johnnie, you're a genius.

310
00:27:28,201 --> 00:27:31,466
Mr. Aysgarth,
I shall have to be getting along now.

311
00:27:32,138 --> 00:27:34,037
What shall we do about the bill?

312
00:27:34,106 --> 00:27:37,542
Will you drop it on that pretty little
table on your way out, old boy?

313
00:27:37,609 --> 00:27:39,167
Yes. Thank you.

314
00:27:47,951 --> 00:27:51,387
And may I wish you both
the very best of everything.

315
00:27:51,455 --> 00:27:53,787
- Thank you.
- Goodbye, Mr. Bailey.

316
00:27:55,459 --> 00:27:58,428
I never dreamt I would have
such a gorgeous place.

317
00:27:58,494 --> 00:28:00,792
Are you sure you can afford it?

318
00:28:01,663 --> 00:28:04,291
- I've forgotten your name.
- Ethel, sir.

319
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:07,868
- Well, Ethel, what about some tea?
- Very good, sir.

320
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:11,330
- What do you think of Ethel?
- She seems perfect.

321
00:28:11,405 --> 00:28:13,498
- Are you sure...
- Let's go in the drawing room.

322
00:28:26,385 --> 00:28:28,579
- Where are we?
- The Hunt Ball.

323
00:28:29,087 --> 00:28:30,850
- Where else?
- Venice.

324
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:32,479
And?

325
00:28:32,557 --> 00:28:35,993
And Naples, and Capri,
and Monte Carlo, and Nice.

326
00:28:36,061 --> 00:28:37,459
- And?
- Paris.

327
00:28:37,528 --> 00:28:38,654
Paris.

328
00:28:40,498 --> 00:28:43,230
I beg your pardon. A
telegram for you, sir.

329
00:28:43,243 --> 00:28:44,400
Thank you, Ethel.

330
00:28:51,974 --> 00:28:53,669
It isn't bad news, is it, dear?

331
00:28:53,743 --> 00:28:56,835
An old friend of mine.
Stupid fellow, he wants Â£1,000.

332
00:28:56,911 --> 00:29:00,938
- You couldn't spare Â£1,000, could you?
- What does he want it for?

333
00:29:01,816 --> 00:29:05,115
Hanged if I know.
Probably because I borrowed it from him.

334
00:29:05,186 --> 00:29:06,482
You borrowed it? Why?

335
00:29:06,553 --> 00:29:09,852
I was going on a honeymoon
with the loveliest girl in the world...

336
00:29:09,923 --> 00:29:12,892
and I wanted her to be happy.
Was she happy?

337
00:29:13,627 --> 00:29:17,187
- Didn't you have any money of your own?
- Not a shilling.

338
00:29:19,064 --> 00:29:21,429
But I thought... I had the impression...

339
00:29:21,499 --> 00:29:24,559
Don't worry your darling little head
about it today of all days.

340
00:29:24,636 --> 00:29:27,196
I'll take care of old Henry somehow.

341
00:29:27,272 --> 00:29:29,466
I still don't understand.

342
00:29:30,307 --> 00:29:31,831
Are you broke?

343
00:29:32,543 --> 00:29:35,636
Monkeyface, I've been broke all my life.

344
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:40,306
Why didn't you tell me? Every time
I brought the subject up, you...

345
00:29:40,383 --> 00:29:43,375
Whatever made you
take this extravagant house?

346
00:29:43,451 --> 00:29:45,886
I didn't think you'd
want to live in a shack.

347
00:29:45,955 --> 00:29:49,719
A girl like you is going to come into
plenty of money someday.

348
00:29:49,791 --> 00:29:53,055
Wait a minute,
I can't quite get this into my head.

349
00:29:53,127 --> 00:29:56,028
Were you thinking
of my inheritance when...

350
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:58,454
I don't know what to say.

351
00:29:58,531 --> 00:30:00,329
Now, darling, really.

352
00:30:00,634 --> 00:30:04,000
Isn't it silly to spend
the best years of our lives waiting?

353
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05,662
Why not be comfortable now?

354
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,170
Johnnie...

355
00:30:08,675 --> 00:30:11,268
I'm just beginning to understand you.

356
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:13,099
You're a baby.

357
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:18,082
I know you didn't marry me for my money.
You'd have done much better elsewhere.

358
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:21,444
But my income
will never pay for all this. Never.

359
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,921
What about your father?

360
00:30:28,058 --> 00:30:31,458
I couldn't possibly ask my father.
Or even my mother.

361
00:30:31,694 --> 00:30:35,494
You saw how restrained she was
when she met us at the station.

362
00:30:35,564 --> 00:30:39,897
Anyway, you wouldn't actually
want to live on your wife's allowance?

363
00:30:40,535 --> 00:30:43,060
- Of course not, darling.
- Well, then?

364
00:30:44,938 --> 00:30:46,304
Answer me, Johnnie.

365
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:53,675
I suppose if the worst comes to the worst
and there's no other way out...

366
00:30:53,746 --> 00:30:55,942
- I suppose I'll have to...
- What?

367
00:30:56,016 --> 00:30:58,916
Borrow some more.
I haven't touched old Middleham yet.

368
00:30:58,985 --> 00:31:01,749
He ought to be good
for a month or two's housekeeping.

369
00:31:03,388 --> 00:31:05,379
I think you must be mad.

370
00:31:07,826 --> 00:31:11,283
Marrying you is the sanest thing
I ever did in my life.

371
00:31:15,699 --> 00:31:17,131
Come on, give it to me.

372
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,281
That's too heavy for a
little girl like you.

373
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:20,067
Thank you, sir.

374
00:31:20,136 --> 00:31:21,899
Clear off the table.

375
00:31:25,774 --> 00:31:28,607
Here, take that. Is there any cake?

376
00:31:29,378 --> 00:31:31,971
- Yes, sir.
- Go along, get it.

377
00:31:32,046 --> 00:31:33,844
Here, dear. Come on.

378
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:40,808
Thank you.

379
00:31:45,325 --> 00:31:47,452
There's going to be no more borrowing.

380
00:31:47,527 --> 00:31:50,893
- What else is there to do?
- You've got to go to work.

381
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:53,097
- Work?
- Yes, work.

382
00:31:54,466 --> 00:31:57,094
You mean put on old clothes,
go out with a shovel?

383
00:31:57,169 --> 00:31:58,635
Don't be flippant.

384
00:31:58,703 --> 00:32:00,068
Then what do you mean?

385
00:32:01,005 --> 00:32:04,940
I'm afraid you're a bit of a dreamer.
Let's be practical about this.

386
00:32:05,008 --> 00:32:07,203
Do you know the statistics
on unemployment?

387
00:32:07,277 --> 00:32:11,771
Do you realize in order to be a plumber,
or a carpenter, or an electrician...

388
00:32:11,848 --> 00:32:13,974
Darling, you haven't been around.

389
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:16,518
They have to be apprentices first.
Even after that...

390
00:32:16,585 --> 00:32:19,611
- Darling.
- There are all sorts of jobs.

391
00:32:19,689 --> 00:32:22,919
I'm broad-minded.
Let's have some tea and then talk it over.

392
00:32:22,991 --> 00:32:26,188
I could make out a list of jobs.
It might be fun.

393
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:29,629
I'll get a pencil and paper.
Excuse me, dear.

394
00:32:33,968 --> 00:32:35,162
It's right there behind you.

395
00:32:35,668 --> 00:32:36,657
Hello?

396
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:39,060
Hello, Mother.

397
00:32:39,639 --> 00:32:42,938
Yes, it's wonderful.
A most beautiful house.

398
00:32:44,077 --> 00:32:46,772
Would you tell Father how badly I felt?

399
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,515
He is? Wait a minute till I tell Johnnie.

400
00:32:51,582 --> 00:32:56,075
Father's sending us a wedding present.
Mother told him how happy I looked and...

401
00:32:56,152 --> 00:32:58,587
I can't tell you how much
this means to me.

402
00:32:58,656 --> 00:33:01,249
- Me, too.
- Yes. Father?

403
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:07,589
- Come on, ask him when he's sending it.
- It's coming right away, by messenger.

404
00:33:07,663 --> 00:33:10,962
Invite them over for dinner.
Perhaps he'd like to play some golf.

405
00:33:11,033 --> 00:33:14,433
Tell him that we were in the throes
of job-hunting when he telephoned.

406
00:33:14,502 --> 00:33:18,666
- It doesn't hurt to impress the old boy.
- Really, you are the limit.

407
00:33:19,072 --> 00:33:21,507
How can you be so gay about something...

408
00:33:21,576 --> 00:33:23,805
that you should be ashamed of?

409
00:33:24,144 --> 00:33:25,611
What, Father?

410
00:33:25,912 --> 00:33:28,812
Yes, Johnnie and I were just having...

411
00:33:29,148 --> 00:33:32,777
a sober and comprehensive discussion
of that very subject.

412
00:33:32,985 --> 00:33:36,647
He has several ideas of the kind of job
he'd like to do...

413
00:33:37,022 --> 00:33:39,321
and several good opportunities.

414
00:33:40,892 --> 00:33:43,291
There's a messenger
from General McLaidlaw.

415
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,625
- Bring it in.
- It's just come, Father. Hold on, do.

416
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:53,158
I think I know what it is,
and if it is what I think it is...

417
00:33:53,237 --> 00:33:55,204
Johnnie, you'll be thrilled.

418
00:33:55,271 --> 00:33:57,431
It is! How wonderful.

419
00:33:58,341 --> 00:34:01,173
We've had them in the family
before I was born.

420
00:34:01,243 --> 00:34:04,542
Father's had lots of offers to sell them,
but he never would.

421
00:34:06,113 --> 00:34:09,446
- How many more, for heaven's sake?
- Just these two, sir.

422
00:34:09,517 --> 00:34:11,451
He sent us both of them.

423
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:14,147
These are Father's
most precious possessions.

424
00:34:14,221 --> 00:34:15,653
You don't say.

425
00:34:15,722 --> 00:34:19,055
These will be our first heirlooms
to be handed down to our children...

426
00:34:19,125 --> 00:34:20,790
and then to their children.

427
00:34:20,803 --> 00:34:23,618
That's the thing to do
with them, all right.

428
00:34:25,632 --> 00:34:29,430
Father, you're so good to me
that you make me want to cry.

429
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:35,828
What was that?

430
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:39,338
Yes, you've made me very happy.

431
00:34:41,578 --> 00:34:44,102
You've made Johnnie very happy, too.

432
00:34:46,383 --> 00:34:49,181
Just a minute, he wants to say something.

433
00:34:50,553 --> 00:34:54,489
Say something very nice.
These chairs really belong in a museum.

434
00:34:54,557 --> 00:34:55,818
Hello, General.

435
00:34:55,890 --> 00:34:59,621
Yes, but really, shouldn't you
have sent them to a museum?

436
00:34:59,928 --> 00:35:02,760
Naturally we're thrilled. Who wouldn't be?

437
00:35:03,198 --> 00:35:04,630
What, a job?

438
00:35:05,099 --> 00:35:09,865
Yes, Lina and I were just going into that.
I have some excellent opportunities.

439
00:35:10,136 --> 00:35:11,967
What are they?

440
00:35:13,573 --> 00:35:16,769
I've just received a letter
from my cousin, Captain Melbeck.

441
00:35:16,842 --> 00:35:18,901
Yes, he is a splendid chap.

442
00:35:19,478 --> 00:35:23,539
He wants someone to manage his estate.
I thought I'd take the job.

443
00:35:23,615 --> 00:35:25,411
I'm glad you approve.

444
00:35:25,583 --> 00:35:29,041
Yes, we must. We'll get together soon.
I'll leave it up to Lina, shall I?

445
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,088
All right. Goodbye, sir.

446
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:36,584
That was a fib about Captain Melbeck,
wasn't it?

447
00:35:36,659 --> 00:35:37,887
Was it?

448
00:35:48,436 --> 00:35:51,530
- Did you have this letter all the time?
- I did.

449
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,339
Why didn't you tell me?

450
00:35:55,143 --> 00:35:57,940
Because, dear,
I never dreamed I'd be using it...

451
00:35:58,011 --> 00:36:02,504
any more than I ever dreamed we'd be
receiving these two beautiful chairs.

452
00:36:20,831 --> 00:36:24,028
Hello. It's a nice place
old Johnnie's got here.

453
00:36:24,101 --> 00:36:27,867
It's an old Georgian house, isn't it?
I bet it cost him a packet to redecorate.

454
00:36:27,938 --> 00:36:30,269
- Who are you?
- I'm Beaky Thwaite.

455
00:36:31,274 --> 00:36:34,243
- You must be old Johnnie's wife.
- Yes, I am.

456
00:36:34,476 --> 00:36:36,444
Didn't he ever tell you about me?

457
00:36:36,512 --> 00:36:38,877
You're Beaky.

458
00:36:38,947 --> 00:36:40,937
That's what they used to call me at school.

459
00:36:41,015 --> 00:36:44,212
I happened to be driving by.
I thought I'd pop in for a cup of tea.

460
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:46,276
I've heard so much about you,
Mr. Thwaite.

461
00:36:46,353 --> 00:36:47,911
Johnnie told me about you, too.

462
00:36:47,988 --> 00:36:50,319
I ran into him at Newbury Races last week.

463
00:36:51,392 --> 00:36:52,722
The races?

464
00:36:52,825 --> 00:36:55,487
Put my foot in it as usual, have I?
Didn't he tell you?

465
00:36:56,663 --> 00:36:59,358
Johnnie has a job.
He couldn't have been at the races.

466
00:36:59,431 --> 00:37:00,762
Besides, he's given up betting.

467
00:37:00,832 --> 00:37:03,130
He has, has he?
Don't you believe it, not Johnnie.

468
00:37:03,202 --> 00:37:07,001
He's a great lad, he is.
You mustn't mind Johnnie cutting up.

469
00:37:07,071 --> 00:37:08,732
That's what makes him Johnnie.

470
00:37:08,806 --> 00:37:11,331
Besides, he thinks you're a topper,
he does.

471
00:37:11,442 --> 00:37:15,172
- I think so, too.
- Won't you sit down?

472
00:37:15,245 --> 00:37:18,009
I don't see why not. Something wrong?

473
00:37:18,147 --> 00:37:21,480
Yes. There were two chairs here
this morning before I left.

474
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:24,144
Chairs? Disappeared, have they?

475
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,347
Yes, apparently.

476
00:37:27,488 --> 00:37:31,185
- Were they expensive?
- Yes, they were museum pieces.

477
00:37:33,795 --> 00:37:38,425
That Johnnie, he'll be the death of me.
Don't you understand?

478
00:37:38,699 --> 00:37:41,826
- No, I don't.
- I bet you 20-to-1 that Johnnie sold them.

479
00:37:41,901 --> 00:37:43,369
Sold them? What for?

480
00:37:43,437 --> 00:37:46,873
For money, of course. A fellow's got to pay
his racing debts, hasn't he?

481
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:50,102
Johnnie dropped a packet of money
at Newbury, I can tell you that.

482
00:37:50,175 --> 00:37:54,043
These bookies don't trust a chap for long.
Not a chap like Johnnie, that is.

483
00:37:54,112 --> 00:37:57,479
I don't believe you.
I don't believe a word you're saying.

484
00:37:57,549 --> 00:37:59,277
Put my foot in it again, have I?

485
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:03,844
My dear, you mustn't take it so seriously.
After all, it's Johnnie.

486
00:38:04,455 --> 00:38:08,686
Wonderful chap, there's nobody like him.
But I needn't tell you that.

487
00:38:08,858 --> 00:38:13,022
He couldn't have sold them.
He wouldn't, without asking me.

488
00:38:13,595 --> 00:38:16,393
Here he comes.
Don't tell him I've said a word.

489
00:38:16,465 --> 00:38:18,592
If you want to see Johnnie
at his very best...

490
00:38:18,667 --> 00:38:22,068
just say something about chairs.
He doesn't need more than one second...

491
00:38:22,137 --> 00:38:24,196
to invent the most howling lie
you ever heard.

492
00:38:24,273 --> 00:38:27,002
I wouldn't have missed this
for anything in the world.

493
00:38:27,408 --> 00:38:29,808
- Beaky.
- Johnnie, how are you?

494
00:38:29,877 --> 00:38:32,504
- What are you doing here?
- I just popped in to see you.

495
00:38:32,579 --> 00:38:34,206
I'm so glad to see you.

496
00:38:34,781 --> 00:38:36,873
How's my little Monkeyface?

497
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:40,248
- What's the matter, darling?
- Nothing. Why?

498
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:41,581
You sure?

499
00:38:42,254 --> 00:38:45,518
Your wife seems to be missing
some chairs, old boy.

500
00:38:46,391 --> 00:38:48,791
Your pipe's not lit.
Let me get you a match.

501
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,157
Thanks, old bean.

502
00:38:56,166 --> 00:38:58,794
- Here you are, catch.
- Thanks, old boy.

503
00:38:59,036 --> 00:39:02,665
About those chairs, old bean?
The missing chairs, old man.

504
00:39:03,139 --> 00:39:04,606
Yes, the chairs.

505
00:39:04,674 --> 00:39:07,074
I imagine the American came
to get them this morning.

506
00:39:07,143 --> 00:39:08,201
What American?

507
00:39:08,277 --> 00:39:11,576
Didn't I tell you about him, darling?
How stupid of me.

508
00:39:11,647 --> 00:39:15,081
He dropped by about a week ago.
A friend of Melbeck's.

509
00:39:15,382 --> 00:39:16,873
I think you were out riding.

510
00:39:17,319 --> 00:39:18,546
Go on, old man.

511
00:39:19,853 --> 00:39:22,947
Anyway, he admired the chairs.
Extravagant fellow.

512
00:39:23,023 --> 00:39:26,458
Offered Â£100 apiece for them.
Can you imagine? Anyone would take that.

513
00:39:27,527 --> 00:39:28,926
I wouldn't.

514
00:39:30,863 --> 00:39:32,887
Wouldn't you really, dear?

515
00:39:33,765 --> 00:39:35,562
That never occurred to me.

516
00:39:36,935 --> 00:39:39,130
As a matter of fact, I told him you would.

517
00:39:39,705 --> 00:39:41,729
Why didn't you mention it?

518
00:39:41,972 --> 00:39:44,236
I'm sorry, darling, but I thought I did.

519
00:39:44,308 --> 00:39:47,401
That's all right.
If they're gone, they're gone.

520
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,479
They're gone, all right.

521
00:39:49,779 --> 00:39:51,872
Shall we change for dinner?

522
00:39:52,415 --> 00:39:53,541
You are an angel.

523
00:39:55,517 --> 00:39:59,078
Hold on a minute.
You say he offered Â£100 apiece for them?

524
00:39:59,555 --> 00:40:01,852
- That's right.
- Let's have a look at the check.

525
00:40:01,923 --> 00:40:04,517
- He'll send it along.
- I bet you Â£10 to a shilling...

526
00:40:04,592 --> 00:40:07,993
you wouldn't dare let your wife pick up
the telephone and ask Melbeck...

527
00:40:08,062 --> 00:40:10,188
if he ever saw this American.

528
00:40:10,263 --> 00:40:13,198
Are you implying
that my husband is a liar?

529
00:40:13,266 --> 00:40:16,200
Don't mind Beaky, he's only joking.

530
00:40:16,636 --> 00:40:19,035
I prefer jokes on other subjects.

531
00:40:19,271 --> 00:40:21,399
Are you staying for dinner?

532
00:40:21,508 --> 00:40:24,703
I'm spending the weekend
unless you throw me out.

533
00:40:24,776 --> 00:40:29,543
Johnnie's friends are always welcome,
as long as they remain Johnnie's friends.

534
00:40:45,361 --> 00:40:47,158
Hello, Isobel. Good afternoon.

535
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:49,391
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Admiring your display?

536
00:40:49,465 --> 00:40:50,454
It's nice.

537
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,397
You are our only local celebrity.

538
00:40:53,802 --> 00:40:55,702
- Are you going my way?
- Yes, I am.

539
00:40:55,771 --> 00:40:57,397
- How's Johnnie?
- He's fine.

540
00:40:57,471 --> 00:41:00,907
I just bought your latest for him.
He's an ardent admirer of yours.

541
00:41:00,975 --> 00:41:03,705
I don't believe there's one of your stories
he hasn't read.

542
00:41:03,844 --> 00:41:07,244
- What's the matter?
- I just remembered something.

543
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,744
Will you excuse me?
I want to make some inquiries.

544
00:41:09,816 --> 00:41:11,806
- Certainly.
- I'll see you for dinner soon.

545
00:41:11,884 --> 00:41:14,751
- Delighted.
- I'll phone you, then. Goodbye.

546
00:41:20,892 --> 00:41:22,520
Hello, old girl.

547
00:41:22,895 --> 00:41:25,953
Mr. Thwaite, I owe you an apology.

548
00:41:26,196 --> 00:41:28,062
Good. I mean, what for?

549
00:41:28,132 --> 00:41:32,033
I'll explain to you later,
but I'm afraid I've done you an injustice.

550
00:41:32,102 --> 00:41:36,436
An injustice? Thanks very much.
I forgive you from the bottom of my heart.

551
00:41:37,441 --> 00:41:39,032
You seem a bit hot under the collar.

552
00:41:39,108 --> 00:41:41,338
Not angry, are you? Don't answer. You are.

553
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:44,207
- Must be about old Johnnie.
- Would you excuse me? I...

554
00:41:44,279 --> 00:41:47,248
You mustn't be angry with Johnnie.
It's a waste of time.

555
00:41:47,315 --> 00:41:50,250
If you want to get sore with me,
that's different altogether.

556
00:41:50,318 --> 00:41:54,185
I annoy everybody, always did.
But not Johnnie. You mustn't, really.

557
00:41:56,824 --> 00:41:59,759
Would you mind, I want to speak
to Johnnie alone. Could you...

558
00:41:59,827 --> 00:42:01,851
- You mean out in the garden?
- Please.

559
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:05,394
Hello. Don't move. Just stay like that.

560
00:42:05,465 --> 00:42:07,364
I must watch the expressions
on your faces.

561
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:09,033
What've you got there, old bean?

562
00:42:09,101 --> 00:42:11,694
You'll find out soon enough.
This is a red-letter day.

563
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:14,461
- Yes, sir?
- What have we to drink in the house?

564
00:42:14,539 --> 00:42:16,836
Gin, brandy, champagne and Pimm's No. 1.

565
00:42:16,907 --> 00:42:19,432
- Bring them all, and get a move on.
- Very good, sir.

566
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:21,306
Stand aside.

567
00:42:21,377 --> 00:42:24,744
Remember that necklace you admired
in the shop window in Regent Street?

568
00:42:24,814 --> 00:42:25,906
It's yours.

569
00:42:25,982 --> 00:42:29,577
And here... No, that's for Ethel.
Beaky, here's a little present for you.

570
00:42:29,652 --> 00:42:31,414
- What is it?
- It's a secret.

571
00:42:31,487 --> 00:42:34,581
- Stick.
- That's the finest that money can buy.

572
00:42:34,656 --> 00:42:37,124
- Thanks, old bean.
- Hold those a moment, will you?

573
00:42:37,192 --> 00:42:39,182
Darling, do you remember this?

574
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:43,094
I saw the hungry eye you gave it
last time we were up in London. It's yours.

575
00:42:43,164 --> 00:42:45,154
Thank you, Beaky.

576
00:42:45,465 --> 00:42:46,956
Here are some hats for you.

577
00:42:47,034 --> 00:42:49,524
Never did like your hats
from the moment I ever saw you.

578
00:42:49,603 --> 00:42:52,970
- Like the funny hat you wore on the train.
- I don't understand.

579
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:55,837
- What made you do all this?
- Now, dear, don't be angry.

580
00:42:55,909 --> 00:42:58,934
If you don't like the hats,
you can always return them.

581
00:42:59,011 --> 00:43:01,741
I got a present for myself. Do you mind?

582
00:43:02,146 --> 00:43:05,946
I say, old girl, this is a nice stick.
Strong.

583
00:43:09,487 --> 00:43:11,420
- Dog?
- That's right.

584
00:43:11,488 --> 00:43:13,717
- All dogs are fond of me.
- Go to Monkeyface.

585
00:43:13,789 --> 00:43:16,384
But, Johnnie, you haven't told us
what this is all about.

586
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:19,156
- Yes, what's it mean?
- I have the pleasure of announcing...

587
00:43:19,229 --> 00:43:21,753
the Goodwood Cup was run today
and I backed the winner.

588
00:43:21,831 --> 00:43:24,561
A 10-to-1 shot, and I had Â£200 on it.

589
00:43:24,634 --> 00:43:26,999
Â£200 at 10-to-1, that's Â£2,000.

590
00:43:27,068 --> 00:43:28,695
- That's amazing.
- What do you mean?

591
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:30,863
- The way you worked that out so quickly.
- What?

592
00:43:30,939 --> 00:43:34,430
- You know, the little sum.
- You're pulling my leg, old bean.

593
00:43:34,808 --> 00:43:37,207
Darling, what's happened to your tongue?

594
00:43:37,611 --> 00:43:41,205
- I suppose you disapprove of my betting.
- Not with Â£2,000 in her lap.

595
00:43:41,281 --> 00:43:44,216
Come on, smile. I know I've been naughty,
but it's all for you.

596
00:43:44,284 --> 00:43:47,185
- See that? That's Johnnie.
- Go on, darling, smile.

597
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:49,712
Where did you get the Â£200?

598
00:43:49,788 --> 00:43:52,621
- That's not a very tactful question.
- Where did you get it?

599
00:43:52,691 --> 00:43:56,354
You know very well there was no American.
I got it for the chairs, of course.

600
00:43:56,595 --> 00:43:59,222
You sold the chairs
to gamble all your money on a horse.

601
00:43:59,297 --> 00:44:01,265
Not exactly.
I owed the bookies some money.

602
00:44:01,332 --> 00:44:03,663
It's an ancient story,
but you know how bookies are.

603
00:44:04,768 --> 00:44:09,204
I got the Â£200 to pay them off.
But then, along came this hot tip and...

604
00:44:09,405 --> 00:44:11,340
Darling, come on, give us a smile.

605
00:44:11,408 --> 00:44:12,567
Come on, old girl. I know.

606
00:44:12,641 --> 00:44:15,804
- You tickle her chin, and I'll make faces.
- Think that will work?

607
00:44:16,045 --> 00:44:18,376
Come on, smile. Come on, dear.

608
00:44:19,213 --> 00:44:21,613
- Do you see the glimmer of a smile?
- No, not a thing.

609
00:44:21,683 --> 00:44:22,923
- Know any other tricks?
- Yeah.

610
00:44:22,984 --> 00:44:26,351
I got something that never fails.
I make a noise like a duck.

611
00:44:28,555 --> 00:44:29,579
No, that's not doing it.

612
00:44:29,656 --> 00:44:32,419
- Shall I do this at the same time?
- Yeah, try that.

613
00:44:32,491 --> 00:44:33,982
Come on, dear.

614
00:44:35,561 --> 00:44:37,995
I forgot something. Darling, look.

615
00:44:38,464 --> 00:44:41,899
It's a receipt from a certain shop
for a certain pair of chairs.

616
00:44:41,967 --> 00:44:45,027
Paid in full,
and they deliver within the hour.

617
00:44:47,104 --> 00:44:49,437
- Look, she's smiling.
- I dare say she is.

618
00:44:49,641 --> 00:44:51,574
My darling.

619
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:55,107
Well done, old bean.

620
00:44:56,212 --> 00:44:59,943
I say, look. Ethel's done her stuff.
What about celebrating?

621
00:45:00,216 --> 00:45:03,310
You can always trust Beaky to say
the right thing at the right time.

622
00:45:03,386 --> 00:45:05,046
Come on, old bean.

623
00:45:12,494 --> 00:45:14,654
I could do with a pull at the beaker.

624
00:45:14,729 --> 00:45:18,529
Ethel, a present for you. Turn around.

625
00:45:21,369 --> 00:45:22,995
Mr. Aysgarth.

626
00:45:23,837 --> 00:45:27,364
It's much too good for me.
You shouldn't have done that.

627
00:45:28,574 --> 00:45:30,804
- Thank you, sir.
- Don't mention it.

628
00:45:30,876 --> 00:45:33,071
What will my young man think?

629
00:45:33,278 --> 00:45:36,338
- Don't forget the box.
- Yes, sir.

630
00:45:36,415 --> 00:45:40,248
- Don't forget my hat.
- No, sir. Thank you, sir.

631
00:45:40,451 --> 00:45:42,748
- This is yours, old girl.
- Thank you.

632
00:45:42,819 --> 00:45:44,981
- This is yours, old bean.
- Thank you.

633
00:45:45,056 --> 00:45:46,545
Now for a toast.

634
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:49,490
- What have you got there, brandy?
- Just this once.

635
00:45:49,559 --> 00:45:52,550
- You know that's not good for you.
- All right, old man.

636
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:55,927
- Maybe just this once.
- All right, old bean.

637
00:45:56,632 --> 00:46:00,533
I drink to the last bet
that will ever made by Johnnie Aysgarth.

638
00:46:00,602 --> 00:46:02,537
Last bet, old bean.

639
00:46:23,922 --> 00:46:27,551
- Get some water, quick.
- It won't help. I've seen it happen before.

640
00:46:27,626 --> 00:46:31,426
There's nothing much you can do about it.
That's no use, darling.

641
00:46:31,496 --> 00:46:34,896
It will either kill him
or it will go away by itself.

642
00:46:47,976 --> 00:46:49,603
Sorry, old bean.

643
00:46:52,947 --> 00:46:55,472
One of these days, it will kill him.

644
00:47:02,723 --> 00:47:05,283
- Hello, Mrs. Aysgarth.
- How are you, Mrs. Newsham?

645
00:47:05,358 --> 00:47:08,691
- What a lot of books.
- Do you really read them all, my dear?

646
00:47:08,762 --> 00:47:13,061
- I'm afraid not. They're for Johnnie.
- Since when has he...

647
00:47:14,533 --> 00:47:17,263
- Detective stories.
- Yes, he adores them.

648
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:20,461
So Johnnie's settled down
to the simple rural life.

649
00:47:20,538 --> 00:47:24,598
- And it seems to agree with him.
- Abandoned all his vices, has he?

650
00:47:24,975 --> 00:47:27,137
Vices? What vices, Mrs. Newsham?

651
00:47:27,544 --> 00:47:30,444
Such as betting at the races, for instance.

652
00:47:30,613 --> 00:47:33,275
He has no time for that.
He's much too busy with his job.

653
00:47:33,349 --> 00:47:37,149
Is he? Then he must have taken
an afternoon off last Tuesday.

654
00:47:37,386 --> 00:47:39,683
He was at the Merchester Races.

655
00:47:40,222 --> 00:47:43,214
Was he? How interesting. Good afternoon.

656
00:47:44,126 --> 00:47:45,388
Goodbye.

657
00:48:02,708 --> 00:48:05,939
- Good afternoon, Mrs. Aysgarth.
- Good afternoon. Is Mr. Aysgarth in?

658
00:48:06,011 --> 00:48:07,876
Why, no.

659
00:48:09,214 --> 00:48:11,681
- When do you expect him?
- I really couldn't say.

660
00:48:11,749 --> 00:48:14,240
Perhaps you'd like to talk
to Captain Melbeck.

661
00:48:14,318 --> 00:48:16,616
Yes, I would very much, please.

662
00:48:18,689 --> 00:48:20,212
Mrs. Aysgarth to see you.

663
00:48:21,224 --> 00:48:22,419
Come in.

664
00:48:24,261 --> 00:48:27,094
- What a pleasure to see you.
- Good afternoon.

665
00:48:27,564 --> 00:48:29,588
- Do sit down.
- Thank you.

666
00:48:32,434 --> 00:48:35,129
I don't want to impose upon you...

667
00:48:35,203 --> 00:48:38,764
but you're Johnnie's cousin
as well as his employer.

668
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:42,967
I wanted to talk to you about him.
I'm terribly worried.

669
00:48:43,277 --> 00:48:45,438
Yes, I can understand that.

670
00:48:46,613 --> 00:48:50,572
On the other hand, I told him
I wouldn't prosecute. Of course...

671
00:48:50,651 --> 00:48:54,108
- I don't understand.
- I told him I wouldn't prosecute.

672
00:48:56,455 --> 00:48:58,888
What on earth are you talking about?

673
00:48:58,957 --> 00:49:01,016
How does he get away with it?

674
00:49:01,092 --> 00:49:03,821
What reason did he give you
when I discharged him?

675
00:49:03,894 --> 00:49:07,489
- When did you discharge him?
- Six weeks ago.

676
00:49:09,167 --> 00:49:11,999
I haven't a very keen sense of humor.

677
00:49:12,902 --> 00:49:15,871
If this is a joke, I
wish you would tell me.

678
00:49:16,206 --> 00:49:18,332
It's not funny to me.

679
00:49:18,975 --> 00:49:21,636
We had an unexpected audit
six weeks ago.

680
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:24,440
The accounts showed a deficit of Â£2,000.

681
00:49:25,147 --> 00:49:28,048
And when I looked into
Johnnie's records...

682
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:30,378
I'm terribly sorry.

683
00:49:30,785 --> 00:49:32,753
He should have told you.

684
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:34,878
It's perfectly all right.

685
00:49:34,956 --> 00:49:37,789
And you say
you aren't going to prosecute?

686
00:49:38,625 --> 00:49:40,456
Not for the time being.

687
00:49:40,527 --> 00:49:44,485
I'll give him every possible opportunity
of replacing the money, but...

688
00:49:45,764 --> 00:49:47,391
after all...

689
00:49:49,201 --> 00:49:52,170
Yes, of course. Thank you very much.

690
00:49:58,076 --> 00:49:59,337
Goodbye.

691
00:50:03,547 --> 00:50:06,277
- Good afternoon, madam.
- Mr. Aysgarth home yet?

692
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:07,680
No, madam.

693
00:51:33,858 --> 00:51:36,452
- Then you've heard.
- Yes, I've heard.

694
00:51:40,065 --> 00:51:42,498
I'm so sorry, darling. I'm terribly sorry.

695
00:51:44,134 --> 00:51:48,195
This telegram just came from the doctor.
It tells how it happened.

696
00:52:10,223 --> 00:52:12,784
And to my dear sister, Emily Scudamore...

697
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:17,353
I bequeath an annuity of Â£1,000
for the duration of her lifetime.

698
00:52:18,331 --> 00:52:22,357
To my niece, Miss Elsie Chilling,
the sum of Â£5,000.

699
00:52:23,469 --> 00:52:27,996
To my two dear cousins,
Robert and Jane Atwood, Â£500 each.

700
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:33,569
The residue of my estate, my house,
and all the property contained therein...

701
00:52:33,643 --> 00:52:36,169
I leave to my beloved wife, Martha...

702
00:52:36,246 --> 00:52:40,808
with the wish that she continue
the present allowance of Â£500 a year...

703
00:52:40,884 --> 00:52:42,976
to my daughter, Lina.

704
00:52:44,921 --> 00:52:48,582
Also, to my daughter Lina
and her husband John Aysgarth...

705
00:52:49,025 --> 00:52:51,549
I bequeath the portrait of myself...

706
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:54,891
painted by the distinguished
Sir Joshua Nettlewood.

707
00:53:03,437 --> 00:53:05,802
- I could do with a drink.
- I'll get you one.

708
00:53:05,872 --> 00:53:09,035
Don't bother, I'll get it myself.
In the study, isn't it?

709
00:53:32,195 --> 00:53:33,822
You win, old boy.

710
00:53:48,843 --> 00:53:50,174
Yes, dear?

711
00:53:51,212 --> 00:53:54,375
Do you ever have any regrets
that you married me?

712
00:53:55,015 --> 00:53:56,812
Why do you ask that?

713
00:53:57,417 --> 00:53:58,781
It seems pretty obvious...

714
00:53:58,851 --> 00:54:01,445
that your father would've left you
more than his portrait...

715
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:03,818
if you'd been anybody else
but Mrs. John Aysgarth.

716
00:54:03,889 --> 00:54:05,914
So that's what you meant.

717
00:54:06,092 --> 00:54:08,492
You haven't answered my question.

718
00:54:08,928 --> 00:54:11,521
What about you? Have you any regrets?

719
00:54:13,064 --> 00:54:17,625
Monkeyface, marrying you is the one thing
I've never changed my mind about.

720
00:54:18,368 --> 00:54:21,632
- Do you really mean that?
- Yes, I really mean that.

721
00:54:22,406 --> 00:54:25,465
I want nothing
but to spend the rest of my life with you.

722
00:54:25,541 --> 00:54:28,066
And if you were to die first, I...

723
00:54:28,311 --> 00:54:30,210
If I were to die first?

724
00:54:32,881 --> 00:54:34,815
Listen, what about you?

725
00:54:35,584 --> 00:54:38,212
I couldn't stop loving you if I tried.

726
00:54:40,154 --> 00:54:41,678
Have you tried?

727
00:54:43,157 --> 00:54:45,215
Yes. Once.

728
00:54:47,261 --> 00:54:48,454
When?

729
00:54:50,063 --> 00:54:53,691
When I found out you'd lost your job
with Captain Melbeck.

730
00:54:57,369 --> 00:55:00,304
- How long have you known?
- Since last Friday.

731
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:04,199
- Who told you?
- Captain Melbeck. I met him.

732
00:55:06,777 --> 00:55:09,769
- Did he tell you why?
- No.

733
00:55:12,182 --> 00:55:14,173
Suppose you tell me why.

734
00:55:14,484 --> 00:55:16,475
We just didn't get along.

735
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:20,785
Quite nice here.
Shall we stop and look at the sea?

736
00:55:29,164 --> 00:55:31,597
Why didn't you get along with him?

737
00:55:31,732 --> 00:55:34,462
I don't know. He's a bit of an old fogy.

738
00:55:34,535 --> 00:55:37,368
I suppose my ideas
were too daring for him.

739
00:55:37,437 --> 00:55:42,136
I've always had the notion that the
secret of success is to start at the top.

740
00:55:44,310 --> 00:55:47,541
You think I'm talking through my hat,
don't you? I'm not.

741
00:55:47,613 --> 00:55:50,672
The way to make money
is to think in a big way.

742
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:55,514
Look at this all land, for instance.
Look at the view.

743
00:55:55,586 --> 00:55:58,054
Why isn't something done about it?

744
00:55:58,289 --> 00:56:01,952
If I had Â£10,000, or
better still, Â£20,000...

745
00:56:02,259 --> 00:56:04,726
I could start a development here.

746
00:56:09,331 --> 00:56:11,596
All you need is Â£20,000?

747
00:56:13,835 --> 00:56:15,268
Or Â£30,000.

748
00:56:16,371 --> 00:56:18,895
An extra Â£10,000 wouldn't hurt a bit.

749
00:56:19,808 --> 00:56:22,105
Beaky, this is the ground plan.

750
00:56:22,176 --> 00:56:25,077
Wonderful. We could put
the large hotel there.

751
00:56:25,146 --> 00:56:28,046
That's the idea. And down here,
we could build the beach huts.

752
00:56:28,114 --> 00:56:30,207
- Beechnuts, old bean?
- Huts, Beaky.

753
00:56:30,884 --> 00:56:35,320
- Hello. What goes on here, anyway?
- We're organizing a real estate company.

754
00:56:35,387 --> 00:56:38,322
We're about to buy
a very beautiful piece of land by the sea.

755
00:56:38,390 --> 00:56:40,756
What a view, what sun, what air.

756
00:56:41,092 --> 00:56:43,288
Then we're going to sell part of it
at a profit.

757
00:56:43,362 --> 00:56:46,296
- Yes, but it will need financing, won't it?
- Of course.

758
00:56:46,364 --> 00:56:48,059
You found somebody
to put up the money?

759
00:56:48,132 --> 00:56:49,463
Of course.

760
00:56:49,534 --> 00:56:51,228
- Who?
- Me.

761
00:56:54,504 --> 00:56:55,697
I see.

762
00:56:56,472 --> 00:56:59,339
The idea is mine,
but the money is Beaky's.

763
00:56:59,609 --> 00:57:03,306
And the corporation, Beaky borrows
against those securities he has in Paris.

764
00:57:03,379 --> 00:57:06,644
Then we issue stock, and...
Let me show you, dear.

765
00:57:08,650 --> 00:57:11,244
The company's going to be in my name.

766
00:57:11,419 --> 00:57:13,818
- Yes, but...
- Look, darling...

767
00:57:14,755 --> 00:57:17,189
let me show you how simple it is.

768
00:57:18,792 --> 00:57:21,386
- Does Beaky understand it?
- Perfectly.

769
00:57:22,061 --> 00:57:23,358
I think.

770
00:57:24,430 --> 00:57:29,264
I beg your pardon, sir. Captain Melbeck
would like to talk to you on the telephone.

771
00:57:31,270 --> 00:57:33,261
Thank you. I'll take it in the study.

772
00:57:33,338 --> 00:57:35,533
- Excuse me, Beaky.
- All right, old bean.

773
00:57:38,042 --> 00:57:40,476
Please explain it to me, will you?

774
00:57:40,544 --> 00:57:42,238
You see, my dear girl...

775
00:57:42,312 --> 00:57:46,339
I say, I rather like this feeling
of big business and all that sort of thing.

776
00:57:46,816 --> 00:57:49,307
George, I keep telling you
not to worry about it.

777
00:57:49,386 --> 00:57:53,015
I've got something on now.
I can pay you back in a couple of weeks.

778
00:57:53,390 --> 00:57:56,517
We buy up this land
and then we sell part of it.

779
00:57:56,592 --> 00:57:59,117
That gives us a 100% profit in no time.

780
00:57:59,194 --> 00:58:02,220
On the other part,
we build something or other.

781
00:58:02,298 --> 00:58:05,425
But from whom do you buy the land?
How much do you pay for it?

782
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:08,935
- To whom do you sell it?
- That shouldn't be difficult.

783
00:58:09,803 --> 00:58:12,135
Isn't it about time you grew up?

784
00:58:12,306 --> 00:58:15,103
- You're scolding me.
- You need a scolding.

785
00:58:15,408 --> 00:58:16,808
- Do I?
- Yes, you do.

786
00:58:16,877 --> 00:58:19,367
Shall I go and stand in the corner?

787
00:58:22,348 --> 00:58:25,806
- You're not being fair to Johnnie.
- That's a bit thick.

788
00:58:26,017 --> 00:58:28,349
Why, he's president
of the whole bally thingamajig.

789
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:31,911
- Gets a salary, writes his own checks.
- Yes, that's what I mean.

790
00:58:31,989 --> 00:58:33,889
What's wrong with that?

791
00:58:34,591 --> 00:58:38,754
Old bean, Lina's been telling me
you're a bit soft in the head. Is that it?

792
00:58:38,828 --> 00:58:42,423
- It sounded like that.
- Come now, that's not very wifely.

793
00:58:42,765 --> 00:58:45,893
Hadn't you better change for dinner?
It's getting late.

794
00:58:45,968 --> 00:58:48,401
Darling, Beaky's staying with us
for a few days.

795
00:58:48,470 --> 00:58:51,268
- You know your room.
- I shan't be a jiffy.

796
00:58:56,177 --> 00:58:59,840
Look here. What right have you
to interfere in my affairs?

797
00:59:00,514 --> 00:59:03,846
I wasn't really. I was only...

798
00:59:04,751 --> 00:59:06,480
You were only what?

799
00:59:06,553 --> 00:59:10,147
I was only trying to tell Beaky that he
shouldn't leave everything to you...

800
00:59:10,222 --> 00:59:13,953
because if something went wrong, he
should take a little responsibility, too.

801
00:59:14,193 --> 00:59:17,492
It's not as if you're both
experienced businessmen.

802
00:59:18,063 --> 00:59:22,021
- What do you know about business?
- Very little. I was only...

803
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:23,863
Suppose Beaky had taken you seriously?

804
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:26,335
You'd have ruined the whole scheme,
you realize that?

805
00:59:26,404 --> 00:59:30,304
- But if it weren't any good...
- That's my business, not yours.

806
00:59:31,508 --> 00:59:33,737
If I say it's good, it's good.

807
00:59:34,276 --> 00:59:35,767
I'm going through with this deal.

808
00:59:35,846 --> 00:59:38,370
I don't want any interference
from you or anyone else.

809
00:59:38,447 --> 00:59:40,915
- Is that clear?
- Yes, that's clear.

810
00:59:52,989 --> 00:59:54,650
Hello, Monkeyface.

811
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:57,957
You frightened me.
I didn't see you coming.

812
01:00:00,329 --> 01:00:03,730
I thought you might like to know
I'm calling off the real estate plan.

813
01:00:03,799 --> 01:00:05,163
Why? What happened?

814
01:00:05,233 --> 01:00:08,065
- Nothing.
- Does Beaky know about this?

815
01:00:08,469 --> 01:00:10,959
- No, not yet.
- Why are you doing it?

816
01:00:11,638 --> 01:00:15,074
I don't know. Perhaps the land
isn't any good. Who knows?

817
01:00:15,142 --> 01:00:18,669
Or perhaps I don't like the idea
of risking Beaky's money.

818
01:00:18,745 --> 01:00:21,736
Or perhaps it's a stiff
job and I'm too lazy.

819
01:00:23,115 --> 01:00:26,743
- Are you still angry about last night?
- No, I'm not angry.

820
01:00:27,153 --> 01:00:30,349
Are you sure?
Because I couldn't sleep all night.

821
01:00:30,522 --> 01:00:33,787
You'd never spoken so sharply
to me before, and I was afraid...

822
01:00:33,858 --> 01:00:35,415
Afraid of what?

823
01:00:36,026 --> 01:00:38,654
I was afraid you'd stopped loving me.

824
01:00:39,096 --> 01:00:41,326
No, Monkeyface, I'm not angry.

825
01:00:41,765 --> 01:00:43,789
And I love you very much.

826
01:00:56,611 --> 01:01:00,138
Every time I play anagrams,
I can only make three-letter words.

827
01:01:00,215 --> 01:01:02,444
D-O-U-B. There's no such word.

828
01:01:03,117 --> 01:01:06,449
D-O-U-B-T. "Doubt." F-U-L. "Doubtful."

829
01:01:06,519 --> 01:01:08,316
Take that, old girl.

830
01:01:08,388 --> 01:01:10,856
Personally, I don't see
what's wrong with this scheme.

831
01:01:10,924 --> 01:01:14,018
But if you say there's no good
going ahead, don't let's go ahead.

832
01:01:14,094 --> 01:01:15,720
Do I get another turn?

833
01:01:15,794 --> 01:01:20,197
I still don't understand why we have to go
all the way out there to look at it.

834
01:01:20,265 --> 01:01:23,564
I won't be responsible
for calling the scheme off...

835
01:01:23,736 --> 01:01:25,979
without first proving
to you it's no good.

836
01:01:25,992 --> 01:01:28,297
If you say it's no good,
that satisfies me.

837
01:01:28,372 --> 01:01:31,169
After all, you discovered the land.
It was your idea.

838
01:01:31,241 --> 01:01:34,904
If a fellow has an idea,
he jolly well ought to follow it up.

839
01:01:34,978 --> 01:01:38,141
You have to go up there
early tomorrow morning and take a look.

840
01:01:38,215 --> 01:01:40,205
Why are you so insistent?

841
01:01:40,549 --> 01:01:43,211
Because, as I told you,
I won't be responsible.

842
01:01:43,285 --> 01:01:47,311
That's a long one. "Mudder".
There's no such word.

843
01:01:47,622 --> 01:01:48,919
Try the "R."

844
01:01:48,990 --> 01:01:53,153
I don't want to go up there in the morning.
Besides, it'll be nasty, and cold, and wet.

845
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:55,724
- Now, Beaky.
- What time do we have to start?

846
01:01:56,930 --> 01:02:00,057
If I had an "e" and an "r"
I could make that murderer.

847
01:02:01,001 --> 01:02:02,399
The earlier the better.

848
01:02:02,468 --> 01:02:05,596
I'd say about 7:00.
There won't be so much traffic then.

849
01:02:05,671 --> 01:02:09,265
- 7:00? That's a bit pig's tail.
- Pig's tail?

850
01:02:09,341 --> 01:02:13,401
Too early.
Did you never hear that one, pig's tail?

851
01:03:12,629 --> 01:03:14,153
Is Mr. Aysgarth having breakfast?

852
01:03:14,231 --> 01:03:17,257
No, ma'am, he wouldn't wait.
He said he'd have some on the road.

853
01:03:17,334 --> 01:03:19,028
He left two hours ago with Mr. Thwaite.

854
01:03:19,101 --> 01:03:21,331
- What car did they use?
- Mr. Thwaite's, I believe.

855
01:06:01,409 --> 01:06:04,207
This ought to do it. Put in the plug now.

856
01:06:06,114 --> 01:06:07,944
How's that, old bean?

857
01:06:13,554 --> 01:06:15,953
- Hello, old girl.
- Hello, darling.

858
01:06:30,368 --> 01:06:33,360
What's all this?
I've only been away a few hours.

859
01:06:33,437 --> 01:06:36,873
- It seemed like a thousand years.
- Seems like that to me, too.

860
01:06:36,941 --> 01:06:38,431
Shut up, Beaky. It was nothing.

861
01:06:38,509 --> 01:06:42,672
Nothing? I came very close
to losing my life. You call that nothing?

862
01:06:43,079 --> 01:06:46,344
- You nearly lost your life?
- Came very close to it.

863
01:06:47,683 --> 01:06:51,050
- Let's drop the subject.
- No, Beaky, go on. I want to hear.

864
01:06:51,854 --> 01:06:55,312
There we were at the top of the cliff.
I agreed that Johnnie was right.

865
01:06:55,391 --> 01:06:57,221
There was too much chalk in the soil.

866
01:06:57,291 --> 01:07:02,193
I was trying to turn my car near the edge
of the cliff. I never was handy with a car.

867
01:07:02,262 --> 01:07:03,729
- Was Johnnie in the car?
- No.

868
01:07:03,797 --> 01:07:05,958
He was a few feet away
looking over at the view.

869
01:07:06,033 --> 01:07:08,865
It's hardly worth talking about.
Let's all have a drink.

870
01:07:08,934 --> 01:07:11,562
I didn't realize I was backing the car
towards the edge.

871
01:07:11,637 --> 01:07:13,502
But I was, by Jove. Right up to it.

872
01:07:13,571 --> 01:07:16,506
If Johnnie hadn't taken a flying leap
and grabbed the brake...

873
01:07:16,574 --> 01:07:19,043
I should be in kingdom come by now.

874
01:07:19,477 --> 01:07:22,139
- Johnnie saved your life?
- He certainly did.

875
01:07:22,213 --> 01:07:24,943
Came jolly close to losing his own, too.

876
01:07:25,215 --> 01:07:28,241
I can never tell you
how much this means to me.

877
01:07:28,318 --> 01:07:31,184
- To you, darling?
- It means a good bit to me, too.

878
01:07:31,254 --> 01:07:34,849
The old fellow deserves a reward.
How about a night out?

879
01:07:35,525 --> 01:07:37,186
A spot of celebrating on me.

880
01:07:37,260 --> 01:07:39,592
That's kind of you,
but don't you have to go to Paris?

881
01:07:39,662 --> 01:07:42,654
- Paris?
- Yes. My securities are over there.

882
01:07:42,731 --> 01:07:45,927
I've got to go over there
and cancel all the arrangements for them.

883
01:07:46,333 --> 01:07:48,427
Why don't you come over with me?

884
01:07:48,502 --> 01:07:51,027
The cad seems to forget
I'm a married man.

885
01:07:51,105 --> 01:07:52,538
I'll tell you what I might do.

886
01:07:52,606 --> 01:07:55,574
I might drive up as far as London with you
for that evening out.

887
01:07:55,642 --> 01:07:58,736
- How about that, Monkeyface?
- Yes, Monkey... Lina. Do let him come.

888
01:07:58,812 --> 01:08:00,575
It seems to me that...

889
01:08:00,647 --> 01:08:03,342
Yes, I know. It seems to you
I should be looking for a job.

890
01:08:03,415 --> 01:08:06,714
It seems to me I'd have much more chance
of getting a job in London.

891
01:08:06,785 --> 01:08:09,082
Yes, of course he would.
Do let him come, Lina.

892
01:08:09,153 --> 01:08:11,748
I don't see very well how I can stop him.

893
01:08:11,823 --> 01:08:13,415
Great.

894
01:08:13,491 --> 01:08:15,925
Pity that he won't come to Paris with me.

895
01:08:15,993 --> 01:08:18,984
Did I ever tell you what happened to me
last time I was in Paris?

896
01:08:19,062 --> 01:08:22,088
A very curious instance. I was
walking down the Champs-lyses...

897
01:08:22,165 --> 01:08:24,793
and I met the most charming girl.

898
01:08:24,868 --> 01:08:28,530
Took her out and gave her a spot of dinner.
And it wasn't till much later...

899
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:32,238
Sorry, old bean. Sorry, old girl.

900
01:08:34,977 --> 01:08:37,706
Nearly put the foot in it again, have I?

901
01:08:55,961 --> 01:08:58,226
There's an Inspector Hodgson
in the hall, ma'am.

902
01:08:58,297 --> 01:08:59,820
He wanted to see Mr. Aysgarth.

903
01:08:59,898 --> 01:09:03,561
But when I said he was away,
he asked if he might speak to you.

904
01:09:06,571 --> 01:09:08,970
Show him to the study,
will you, Ethel, please.

905
01:09:09,039 --> 01:09:10,700
Very good, madam.

906
01:09:18,081 --> 01:09:21,209
- Will you come this way, please, sir?
- Thank you.

907
01:09:30,658 --> 01:09:32,956
- Mrs. Aysgarth?
- Yes.

908
01:09:33,027 --> 01:09:37,019
My name's Hodgson. Inspector Hodgson.
We're from the county police.

909
01:09:37,097 --> 01:09:39,157
This is my colleague. Mr. Benson.

910
01:09:39,233 --> 01:09:41,132
- How do you do, Mr. Benson?
- How do you do?

911
01:09:41,201 --> 01:09:43,499
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you, ma'am.

912
01:09:43,770 --> 01:09:46,260
I understand your husband's not in.

913
01:09:46,472 --> 01:09:48,667
No. He's been up in London for two days.

914
01:09:48,741 --> 01:09:51,971
As he's not here,
I thought you might be able to help us.

915
01:09:52,043 --> 01:09:54,944
Yes, of course.
Won't you have some tea or something?

916
01:09:55,013 --> 01:09:57,276
No, thank you. We've had ours.

917
01:09:57,615 --> 01:10:00,014
I believe you know a Mr. Thwaite.

918
01:10:00,150 --> 01:10:02,449
Yes, he's a close friend of my husband.

919
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:04,851
I don't know how to put it, quite.

920
01:10:05,521 --> 01:10:08,252
Perhaps it would be easier
if I showed you this.

921
01:10:08,325 --> 01:10:09,985
This afternoon's paper.

922
01:10:12,562 --> 01:10:14,029
Excuse me.

923
01:10:51,629 --> 01:10:55,223
I'm sorry. This is a shock.

924
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:59,361
We knew him so very well.

925
01:10:59,436 --> 01:11:02,131
Sorry to have to do this, ma'am...

926
01:11:02,204 --> 01:11:05,799
but we're making inquiries
on behalf of the Paris police.

927
01:11:05,874 --> 01:11:08,172
They found papers
on Mr. Thwaite's person...

928
01:11:08,244 --> 01:11:11,701
which indicated he'd just formed
a corporation with your husband.

929
01:11:16,149 --> 01:11:19,448
What do the French police believe
caused the death?

930
01:11:19,853 --> 01:11:23,380
This is the copy of a telegram
we received from Paris.

931
01:11:31,998 --> 01:11:35,798
"Thwaite visited the place
in the company of another Englishman.

932
01:11:35,867 --> 01:11:38,461
"Both men had evidently been drinking.

933
01:11:38,536 --> 01:11:41,732
"On arrival, Thwaite ordered
a bottle of brandy.

934
01:11:41,805 --> 01:11:45,673
"According to the statement
of one of the waiters there...

935
01:11:45,743 --> 01:11:50,146
"Thwaite's companion asked for
the brandy to be served in large beakers.

936
01:11:50,446 --> 01:11:53,846
"Apparently, as a result of a bet
between the two men...

937
01:11:53,915 --> 01:11:57,976
"Thwaite filled one of these beakers
to the brim and drank it all.

938
01:11:58,287 --> 01:12:01,484
"The other man was not present
when the actual tragedy happened...

939
01:12:01,556 --> 01:12:04,389
"having left the place
a few minutes before.

940
01:12:04,459 --> 01:12:08,326
"French police have not yet succeeded
in establishing his identity.

941
01:12:08,629 --> 01:12:12,394
"According to the waiter, who has
a slight understanding of English...

942
01:12:12,465 --> 01:12:17,163
"his name would appear to be
'Awlbeam' or 'Holebeam'.

943
01:12:20,673 --> 01:12:22,937
I'm sorry to upset you, ma'am.

944
01:12:23,509 --> 01:12:26,773
But do you or your husband
know of any friend of Mr. Thwaite's...

945
01:12:26,844 --> 01:12:29,005
who would answer to such a name?

946
01:12:29,847 --> 01:12:33,840
Perhaps Mrs. Aysgarth could enlighten us
about this corporation.

947
01:12:34,451 --> 01:12:36,443
Yes, I believe I can.

948
01:12:37,087 --> 01:12:40,578
My husband had planned
a real estate development with him.

949
01:12:41,158 --> 01:12:44,820
Mr. Thwaite had gone to Paris
to dissolve the corporation.

950
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:48,129
He apparently died before he could do this.

951
01:12:48,664 --> 01:12:51,599
Thank you, ma'am.
Any further questions, Benson?

952
01:12:51,666 --> 01:12:53,293
None that I can think of.

953
01:12:53,368 --> 01:12:56,201
- Thank you very much, Mrs. Aysgarth.
- Thank you.

954
01:13:05,212 --> 01:13:06,576
I'm sorry.

955
01:13:15,153 --> 01:13:17,417
When does Mr. Aysgarth
return from London?

956
01:13:17,489 --> 01:13:18,979
I expect him this evening.

957
01:13:19,057 --> 01:13:21,217
Would you ask him
to ring me at the station?

958
01:13:21,292 --> 01:13:23,817
Yes, of course.
Goodbye, Inspector Hodgson.

959
01:13:23,894 --> 01:13:25,191
Goodbye.

960
01:13:25,663 --> 01:13:28,154
- Benson.
- Goodbye, Mrs. Aysgarth.

961
01:14:08,633 --> 01:14:10,533
He didn't go to Paris.

962
01:14:10,935 --> 01:14:13,402
He didn't go to Paris, I tell you.

963
01:14:22,745 --> 01:14:23,940
Hogarth Club.

964
01:14:24,014 --> 01:14:26,538
May I speak to Mr. Aysgarth, please?

965
01:14:26,983 --> 01:14:28,917
When do you expect him?

966
01:14:30,553 --> 01:14:32,611
He left yesterday morning?

967
01:14:33,822 --> 01:14:36,256
No. It doesn't matter. Thank you.

968
01:15:00,611 --> 01:15:02,239
Hello, Monkeyface.

969
01:15:14,657 --> 01:15:17,126
You've read about Beaky, have you?

970
01:15:18,894 --> 01:15:21,124
I was terribly fond of Beaky.

971
01:15:21,797 --> 01:15:24,664
- Were you?
- Yes, dear.

972
01:15:25,167 --> 01:15:28,226
I loved that silly, generous,
good-hearted fool.

973
01:15:28,570 --> 01:15:31,562
- Did you?
- Of course I did.

974
01:15:32,406 --> 01:15:35,500
Next to you, I loved him
more than anybody in the world.

975
01:15:35,576 --> 01:15:37,407
Next to me?

976
01:15:39,112 --> 01:15:40,976
Poor Monkeyface.

977
01:15:42,482 --> 01:15:46,248
Here I am thinking only of myself
and forgetting all about you.

978
01:15:46,319 --> 01:15:48,651
You liked him, too, didn't you?

979
01:15:49,488 --> 01:15:51,786
I liked him very much.

980
01:15:54,893 --> 01:15:56,723
The police were here.

981
01:15:59,196 --> 01:16:00,493
What did they want?

982
01:16:01,464 --> 01:16:03,695
They wanted you to help them.

983
01:16:03,934 --> 01:16:05,901
They had a telegram from Paris...

984
01:16:05,969 --> 01:16:09,632
and it seems there was
an Englishman who made a bet...

985
01:16:09,706 --> 01:16:13,106
Yes, I know.
The whole story was in the late edition.

986
01:16:13,408 --> 01:16:14,705
What else?

987
01:16:15,177 --> 01:16:17,805
The inspector wants you to phone him.

988
01:16:18,146 --> 01:16:21,876
He thought perhaps you could
help identify this Englishman.

989
01:16:29,556 --> 01:16:33,117
What did you tell them?
Did you mention the corporation?

990
01:16:33,325 --> 01:16:34,656
Naturally.

991
01:16:34,961 --> 01:16:38,259
I told them that Beaky
was planning to dissolve it.

992
01:16:38,797 --> 01:16:42,664
I wish you'd left all that to me.
What else did you tell them?

993
01:16:43,034 --> 01:16:44,434
That's about all.

994
01:16:44,503 --> 01:16:48,164
I said I was expecting you
back from London at any moment.

995
01:16:59,649 --> 01:17:02,982
Hello. Wickstead police station, please.

996
01:17:06,288 --> 01:17:08,188
Hello, Inspector.

997
01:17:08,523 --> 01:17:11,286
This is John Aysgarth. I've just got home.

998
01:17:12,026 --> 01:17:13,119
Yes.

999
01:17:13,495 --> 01:17:15,985
I drove up to London with him
on Tuesday evening.

1000
01:17:16,063 --> 01:17:17,690
We dined at the Savoy.

1001
01:17:17,765 --> 01:17:18,823
No.

1002
01:17:18,899 --> 01:17:19,956
Yes.

1003
01:17:20,033 --> 01:17:22,195
Then I saw him off at Croyden Airport.

1004
01:17:22,269 --> 01:17:23,360
Yes.

1005
01:17:24,170 --> 01:17:27,139
No. I stayed in London
until this afternoon.

1006
01:17:27,974 --> 01:17:28,962
At my club.

1007
01:17:30,075 --> 01:17:31,134
Yes.

1008
01:17:32,778 --> 01:17:33,836
Yes.

1009
01:17:36,081 --> 01:17:37,513
Not at all, Inspector.

1010
01:17:37,582 --> 01:17:40,449
If I can help you in any other way,
be sure to let me know.

1011
01:18:01,936 --> 01:18:03,767
Isobel, may I come in?

1012
01:18:03,838 --> 01:18:06,363
Lina, how nice.
I was thinking only yesterday...

1013
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:08,568
that I don't see half as much of you
as I'd like.

1014
01:18:08,643 --> 01:18:09,973
How sweet of you.

1015
01:18:10,077 --> 01:18:12,704
I couldn't put my light out
until 3:00 this morning.

1016
01:18:12,778 --> 01:18:14,895
I was so interested in
your last book that I

1017
01:18:14,908 --> 01:18:16,942
had to come over and
talk to you about it.

1018
01:18:17,016 --> 01:18:20,679
That's the most thrilling compliment
I ever got. Come and sit down.

1019
01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:23,746
- Had your tea?
- Yes, I have. Thank you.

1020
01:18:23,823 --> 01:18:26,256
I never knew you were
such a murder story fan.

1021
01:18:26,324 --> 01:18:28,224
Neither did I until recently.

1022
01:18:28,293 --> 01:18:30,852
- Did you really like it?
- I couldn't put it down.

1023
01:18:30,928 --> 01:18:33,419
I was completely fascinated
by the way your villain...

1024
01:18:33,497 --> 01:18:35,691
My villain? My hero, you mean.

1025
01:18:35,765 --> 01:18:38,132
I always think of my murderers
as my heroes.

1026
01:18:38,202 --> 01:18:41,762
I didn't mean to interrupt. You were
saying you were completely fascinated.

1027
01:18:41,838 --> 01:18:45,136
When he enticed his victim
across the footbridge...

1028
01:18:45,207 --> 01:18:47,505
knowing that the bridge
had been sawn through...

1029
01:18:47,576 --> 01:18:50,977
He also knew that his victim
couldn't swim. Don't forget that.

1030
01:18:51,446 --> 01:18:55,644
What I want to know is this.
Would you call that an actual murder?

1031
01:18:55,717 --> 01:18:59,048
From a moral standpoint,
there's no question at all.

1032
01:18:59,119 --> 01:19:00,485
It is murder.

1033
01:19:00,788 --> 01:19:02,254
I suppose it is.

1034
01:19:02,322 --> 01:19:03,755
What does Johnnie think?

1035
01:19:03,823 --> 01:19:06,291
Johnnie?
I haven't discussed it with him yet.

1036
01:19:06,359 --> 01:19:08,121
I should think he'd be interested.

1037
01:19:08,193 --> 01:19:11,128
The same situation
with this friend of his in Paris.

1038
01:19:11,997 --> 01:19:13,089
The same?

1039
01:19:13,165 --> 01:19:15,258
That brandy business
is just like my footbridge.

1040
01:19:15,334 --> 01:19:17,528
If they get his companion,
the question would be:

1041
01:19:17,602 --> 01:19:19,230
Was it murder or an accident?

1042
01:19:19,303 --> 01:19:21,771
The brandy thing isn't new at all,
you know.

1043
01:19:22,606 --> 01:19:25,769
- It's been done before?
- Yes, and in real life, too.

1044
01:19:25,842 --> 01:19:26,934
I have it here.

1045
01:19:27,611 --> 01:19:30,239
Richard Palmer got rid of
one of his victims that way.

1046
01:19:30,313 --> 01:19:32,041
A man called Abbey.

1047
01:19:32,114 --> 01:19:33,309
Was he hanged?

1048
01:19:33,383 --> 01:19:37,842
Trial of Richard Palmer. Where can it be?

1049
01:19:38,020 --> 01:19:41,182
They got him eventually,
after he killed half a dozen other people.

1050
01:19:41,256 --> 01:19:44,589
The fool got bored with the brandy
method and went on with real poison.

1051
01:19:44,659 --> 01:19:47,492
- He was a fool, wasn't he?
- Maybe I put it under the "T's".

1052
01:19:47,562 --> 01:19:51,554
If he'd stuck to brandy, he might have...
That's an interesting idea.

1053
01:19:51,632 --> 01:19:53,725
Suppose I ask my brother about it.

1054
01:19:53,801 --> 01:19:57,634
He's the Home Office Analyst. Conducts
post-mortems and all that sort of things.

1055
01:19:57,704 --> 01:19:59,467
I get some of my neatest ideas from him.

1056
01:19:59,539 --> 01:20:03,531
It really doesn't matter, Isobel.
Please don't bother. It's not important.

1057
01:20:04,209 --> 01:20:06,700
I'll run along. I don't
want to trouble you.

1058
01:20:06,778 --> 01:20:10,714
- Now I remember. It's in your own house.
- What is?

1059
01:20:10,782 --> 01:20:13,682
The Trial of Richard Palmer.
That book about the brandy.

1060
01:20:13,751 --> 01:20:16,584
Johnnie borrowed it
a couple of weeks ago.

1061
01:20:17,987 --> 01:20:20,478
- Goodbye, Isobel.
- Goodbye, my dear.

1062
01:21:32,686 --> 01:21:34,051
Hello?

1063
01:21:34,889 --> 01:21:37,379
No, he isn't in.
This is Mrs. Aysgarth speaking.

1064
01:21:37,457 --> 01:21:39,322
This is
the Guarantors Assurance Company.

1065
01:21:39,392 --> 01:21:43,294
Would you tell Mr. Aysgarth that there's
been a delay in replying to his inquiry?

1066
01:21:43,363 --> 01:21:47,128
We have written him fully on the matter.
He should get our letter in the morning.

1067
01:21:47,432 --> 01:21:49,366
Yes, I will. Thank you.

1068
01:22:13,255 --> 01:22:16,782
- Good morning, madam.
- Good morning. Are there any letters?

1069
01:22:16,859 --> 01:22:20,520
Just three for Mr. Aysgarth
and a magazine for you, ma'am.

1070
01:22:36,175 --> 01:22:38,165
Hello, Ethel. You here again?

1071
01:22:38,243 --> 01:22:41,144
Yes, sir. I've brought
your morning tea and the post.

1072
01:22:41,213 --> 01:22:45,377
- Hello, darling. Any letters for me?
- Three.

1073
01:22:51,322 --> 01:22:52,913
Thank you, dear.

1074
01:23:38,429 --> 01:23:41,330
- Well, well, well.
- Good news?

1075
01:23:41,798 --> 01:23:44,732
Got a letter from old Spotty.
He's going to India.

1076
01:23:46,503 --> 01:23:48,094
What a life.

1077
01:23:48,504 --> 01:23:51,337
Says he wishes he had time
to pop down and see us.

1078
01:23:52,375 --> 01:23:55,742
That'd be a dream. Poor old Spotty.

1079
01:23:58,513 --> 01:24:01,778
- Do you mind if I take my bath before you?
- No, dear.

1080
01:24:15,528 --> 01:24:19,396
May I have some more soap,
Monkeyface? This bit's nearly gone.

1081
01:24:20,365 --> 01:24:23,391
Yes, there's some in the cupboard
above the washbasin.

1082
01:24:46,789 --> 01:24:50,725
- Darling, you're not shivering, are you?
- I've a bit of a chill.

1083
01:24:50,993 --> 01:24:53,927
Cold in all this sunshine?
Let me warm you up.

1084
01:24:54,594 --> 01:24:57,688
My poor little shivering baby.
How do you feel now? Better?

1085
01:24:57,764 --> 01:25:00,756
- Much.
- Good. Perhaps this will help.

1086
01:25:05,505 --> 01:25:09,702
- Darling, what are we doing tonight?
- We're going to Isobel's to dine.

1087
01:25:10,176 --> 01:25:11,370
What a bore.

1088
01:25:24,321 --> 01:25:26,686
Issie, let's get back
to that new book of yours.

1089
01:25:26,756 --> 01:25:31,523
The fellow comes into the room, locks it,
and starts to strum on the piano...

1090
01:25:31,594 --> 01:25:34,586
then somebody shoots him
through the locked door? That the idea?

1091
01:25:35,464 --> 01:25:39,195
That doesn't make sense. Why would he
lock the door just to play the piano?

1092
01:25:39,267 --> 01:25:40,757
Was he ashamed of his playing?

1093
01:25:40,836 --> 01:25:42,360
I arranged it this way.

1094
01:25:42,437 --> 01:25:46,396
A certain note on the piano was wired to
a revolver concealed in the wall paneling.

1095
01:25:46,475 --> 01:25:49,602
When the victim struck this note...
There you are.

1096
01:25:50,543 --> 01:25:53,410
I don't care much for that.
You're slipping, old girl.

1097
01:25:53,480 --> 01:25:56,381
- What's wrong with it, my dear chap?
- That's too complicated.

1098
01:25:56,449 --> 01:25:59,246
If you're going to kill somebody,
do it simply.

1099
01:25:59,318 --> 01:26:01,014
Am I right, Dr. Sedbusk?

1100
01:26:01,087 --> 01:26:04,351
You're right.
Just as long as you don't get caught.

1101
01:26:04,422 --> 01:26:06,914
- Do the wine, will you?
- Yes, Issie.

1102
01:26:07,725 --> 01:26:09,386
How would you do it simply?

1103
01:26:09,460 --> 01:26:12,623
I don't know, dear.
I'd use the most obvious method.

1104
01:26:12,697 --> 01:26:15,359
The most important thing
is that no one should suspect me.

1105
01:26:15,433 --> 01:26:18,663
- For instance?
- For instance, poison.

1106
01:26:19,001 --> 01:26:22,334
Just use the first one
that came to my mind. Say, arsenic.

1107
01:26:23,606 --> 01:26:24,834
Arsenic.

1108
01:26:25,474 --> 01:26:26,964
I remember...

1109
01:26:27,610 --> 01:26:31,545
in Gloucester, where
we exhumed the body four years after...

1110
01:26:31,613 --> 01:26:35,811
there was still enough poison,
even in the fingernails and the hair.

1111
01:26:36,051 --> 01:26:38,645
Yes, but did you get the murderer?

1112
01:26:39,853 --> 01:26:41,252
Let me see.

1113
01:26:41,889 --> 01:26:43,220
No, I don't think we did.

1114
01:26:43,290 --> 01:26:44,450
There you are.

1115
01:26:44,525 --> 01:26:47,517
Think of it. This very minute,
there are hundreds of people...

1116
01:26:47,594 --> 01:26:50,528
who have committed murder
and they're walking about freely.

1117
01:26:50,596 --> 01:26:51,858
Thousands.

1118
01:26:51,931 --> 01:26:54,728
Do you suppose
those murderers are happy, Johnnie?

1119
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:57,291
I don't know, dear.
I don't see why they shouldn't be.

1120
01:26:57,369 --> 01:26:58,996
Fear of discovery, my lad.

1121
01:26:59,071 --> 01:27:02,972
So long as arsenic leaves traces and
a bullet's marked by the barrel of a gun...

1122
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:05,600
and the tiniest hair of your head
can be identified...

1123
01:27:05,675 --> 01:27:09,941
It seems to me by now someone would've
discovered a poison that can't be traced.

1124
01:27:13,783 --> 01:27:15,410
What about it, Doctor?

1125
01:27:16,653 --> 01:27:19,052
A very interesting corpse
dropped in the other day.

1126
01:27:19,121 --> 01:27:23,023
- Do let's hear about it.
- No, please. Don't change the subject.

1127
01:27:23,092 --> 01:27:27,084
I saw that look that passed between you.
There's an untraceable poison, isn't there?

1128
01:27:27,161 --> 01:27:29,128
Nonsense. No such thing.

1129
01:27:29,597 --> 01:27:32,326
I'll bet you know, Doctor. What is it?

1130
01:27:32,699 --> 01:27:34,600
Not in a million years.

1131
01:27:34,669 --> 01:27:37,830
Now, come.
After all, do I look like a murderer?

1132
01:27:37,903 --> 01:27:40,770
That's an interesting question.
What do you think, Issie?

1133
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:43,050
Issie can tell by looking
at a person's face

1134
01:27:43,063 --> 01:27:45,038
whether he or she is
capable of murder.

1135
01:27:45,111 --> 01:27:46,271
Can't you, Issie?

1136
01:27:46,345 --> 01:27:49,438
I don't want to sound conceited,
but I usually can.

1137
01:27:49,514 --> 01:27:51,414
What about me, dear?
Could I murder anyone?

1138
01:27:51,483 --> 01:27:54,509
You couldn't hurt a fly, Bertram.
Unless it was already dead.

1139
01:27:54,586 --> 01:27:58,578
What about Mrs. Aysgarth?
She has a strange glint in her eye.

1140
01:27:58,655 --> 01:28:02,352
I'm afraid not. Lina hasn't the nerve
any more than I have.

1141
01:28:02,593 --> 01:28:05,789
As for you, you silly thing.
Look at the expression on his face.

1142
01:28:05,862 --> 01:28:09,320
Trying to look mysterious, are you?
You can't fool me.

1143
01:28:09,398 --> 01:28:12,958
You couldn't commit a murder
if you tried for 100 years.

1144
01:28:15,971 --> 01:28:18,132
No, I don't believe I could.

1145
01:28:22,543 --> 01:28:25,102
Johnnie, you're locking up.
What about Ethel?

1146
01:28:25,946 --> 01:28:29,108
It's Ethel's day off.
She won't be back until morning.

1147
01:28:29,415 --> 01:28:31,007
What about Cook?

1148
01:28:31,084 --> 01:28:33,052
What's the matter, dear?
Have you forgotten?

1149
01:28:33,118 --> 01:28:35,144
Cook's away on a holiday.

1150
01:29:10,351 --> 01:29:14,286
Darling, you're shivering again.
Do you suppose you're catching cold?

1151
01:29:14,354 --> 01:29:16,151
Yes. I think that's what it must be.

1152
01:29:16,223 --> 01:29:18,885
We have to tuck you into bed.
Get you nice and warm.

1153
01:29:18,959 --> 01:29:21,689
- Take off your coat.
- No, Johnnie. Please don't.

1154
01:29:23,396 --> 01:29:26,524
This reminds me of the day we first met
on the top of the hill...

1155
01:29:26,599 --> 01:29:29,590
when you wouldn't let me unbutton
the top button of your blouse.

1156
01:29:29,668 --> 01:29:31,261
Do you remember?

1157
01:29:33,972 --> 01:29:35,963
I shall never forget it.

1158
01:29:39,443 --> 01:29:42,435
Get undressed, old girl.
What are you waiting for?

1159
01:29:42,513 --> 01:29:46,915
Johnnie, I'm in a state tonight.
I don't know why. I'd like to be alone.

1160
01:29:47,116 --> 01:29:49,949
Would you mind sleeping
in your dressing room?

1161
01:29:52,754 --> 01:29:54,518
Of course I'd mind.

1162
01:29:57,292 --> 01:30:00,522
Please, Johnnie.
I haven't been sleeping very well lately.

1163
01:30:00,728 --> 01:30:02,218
I understand.

1164
01:30:02,463 --> 01:30:05,921
You used to sleep badly
when I wasn't here, and now you...

1165
01:30:07,334 --> 01:30:10,826
All right, if that's how you feel about it.
Good night.

1166
01:30:37,995 --> 01:30:39,552
Feeling better?

1167
01:30:40,029 --> 01:30:41,587
Yes, thank you.

1168
01:30:43,499 --> 01:30:45,660
- Hello, Isobel.
- How are you, my dear?

1169
01:30:45,735 --> 01:30:47,100
All right.

1170
01:30:48,403 --> 01:30:50,963
I've been asleep all day, haven't I?

1171
01:30:51,606 --> 01:30:54,165
Isobel's brother gave you
a sleeping pill this morning.

1172
01:30:54,241 --> 01:30:56,436
Your nerves seemed to be all upset.

1173
01:30:57,077 --> 01:30:59,010
We were quite worried about you.

1174
01:30:59,078 --> 01:31:01,138
Cheer up. Bertram had a good look at you.

1175
01:31:01,215 --> 01:31:05,173
Although he doesn't usually attend
living people, he's a very able doctor.

1176
01:31:05,251 --> 01:31:07,980
He says all you needed was a little sleep.

1177
01:31:08,353 --> 01:31:12,016
I'll run down and tell Ethel
to fix something for your supper.

1178
01:31:16,161 --> 01:31:18,425
He's one in a million,
that Johnnie of yours.

1179
01:31:18,497 --> 01:31:19,622
Isn't he?

1180
01:31:19,697 --> 01:31:21,597
Do you mind if I smoke?

1181
01:31:21,666 --> 01:31:23,133
Have you been here all afternoon?

1182
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:25,793
Naturally. Ever since Johnnie phoned.

1183
01:31:25,869 --> 01:31:27,530
I warn you. You'd better get well.

1184
01:31:27,604 --> 01:31:30,505
If you leave me alone much longer
with this husband of yours...

1185
01:31:30,573 --> 01:31:32,062
my career will soon be over.

1186
01:31:32,141 --> 01:31:35,599
- He flirted with you, I suppose.
- Flirted? Worse than that.

1187
01:31:35,678 --> 01:31:38,203
He's worming all my secrets out of me.

1188
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:41,442
I suspect him of writing
a detective story on the side.

1189
01:31:42,984 --> 01:31:44,542
What secrets?

1190
01:31:44,619 --> 01:31:46,644
He's always pestering me.

1191
01:31:46,721 --> 01:31:49,587
I always swear I won't tell him
and I always do.

1192
01:31:50,157 --> 01:31:51,988
Did you tell him anything today?

1193
01:31:52,059 --> 01:31:56,223
Did I? Bertram was furious.
Said he'd never confide in me again.

1194
01:31:56,863 --> 01:32:00,855
But honestly, have you ever been able
to deny Johnnie anything?

1195
01:32:01,901 --> 01:32:03,265
Never.

1196
01:32:03,968 --> 01:32:05,868
It was about that poison, wasn't it?

1197
01:32:05,937 --> 01:32:09,599
Don't remind me of it. I'm ashamed,
and mortified, and disgraced.

1198
01:32:09,673 --> 01:32:13,871
I'm just a fool, that's all. If he writes
a story on that one before I do...

1199
01:32:13,944 --> 01:32:15,844
I suppose I'll deserve it.

1200
01:32:15,913 --> 01:32:19,246
Imagine. A substance
in daily use everywhere.

1201
01:32:19,750 --> 01:32:21,649
Anyone can lay his hands on it.

1202
01:32:21,718 --> 01:32:25,950
And within a minute after taking,
the victim's beautifully out of the way.

1203
01:32:26,022 --> 01:32:29,014
Mind you, it's undetectable after death.

1204
01:32:30,859 --> 01:32:33,487
Is whatever it is painful?

1205
01:32:33,562 --> 01:32:35,119
Not in the least.

1206
01:32:35,196 --> 01:32:38,757
In fact, I should think
it would be a most pleasant death.

1207
01:33:52,798 --> 01:33:54,458
Good night, Lina.

1208
01:34:32,398 --> 01:34:34,992
You're still annoyed with me, aren't you?

1209
01:34:35,067 --> 01:34:38,058
No, Johnnie, really. I
still don't feel well.

1210
01:34:38,136 --> 01:34:41,572
A few days at your mother's house
will do more good than staying at home.

1211
01:34:41,639 --> 01:34:45,040
It's not exactly that. Don't you
understand? Mother telephoned me and...

1212
01:34:45,109 --> 01:34:47,668
She got on that telephone
awfully early, it seems to me.

1213
01:34:47,744 --> 01:34:51,043
Mother gets up early,
and she's lonely down there.

1214
01:34:51,114 --> 01:34:53,480
I happened to mention I was a bit nervy...

1215
01:34:53,550 --> 01:34:56,916
and before I knew it I'd agreed
to spend a few days with her.

1216
01:34:57,253 --> 01:34:59,653
All right.
I'll run down and get the car ready.

1217
01:34:59,722 --> 01:35:02,714
- No. I'll drive myself.
- I prefer to drive you.

1218
01:36:05,279 --> 01:36:07,474
I think I'll take the short cut.

1219
01:36:12,920 --> 01:36:14,045
Johnnie!

1220
01:36:16,055 --> 01:36:18,080
Johnnie!

1221
01:36:23,295 --> 01:36:25,229
Lina, what's got into you?

1222
01:36:25,296 --> 01:36:29,255
Lina! Stop it, you little fool!

1223
01:36:29,466 --> 01:36:32,526
I've had enough! How much do you think
a man can bear? Listen to me!

1224
01:36:32,603 --> 01:36:35,127
You throw me out of your room,
run off to your mother's...

1225
01:36:35,204 --> 01:36:38,298
now you shrink away from me
as though you hated me. You're my wife.

1226
01:36:38,374 --> 01:36:39,965
You almost killed us both back there.

1227
01:36:40,042 --> 01:36:44,604
You pulled away when I was reaching over
to save you from falling out of the car.

1228
01:36:46,181 --> 01:36:48,580
You don't have to
put up with me anymore.

1229
01:36:49,317 --> 01:36:51,512
Johnnie, where are you going?

1230
01:36:52,053 --> 01:36:55,181
- First, I'm taking you to your mother's.
- And then what?

1231
01:36:55,289 --> 01:36:57,620
Don't worry. I won't bother you again.

1232
01:36:59,192 --> 01:37:01,353
Johnnie, you mean you're going to...

1233
01:37:01,428 --> 01:37:04,795
Why were you asking Isobel
those questions about the poison?

1234
01:37:04,864 --> 01:37:06,728
What were you planning to do with it?

1235
01:37:06,799 --> 01:37:08,824
Johnnie, you were going to kill yourself.

1236
01:37:08,902 --> 01:37:11,028
My darling.

1237
01:37:11,270 --> 01:37:14,000
Yes, but I saw that was a cheap way out.

1238
01:37:14,073 --> 01:37:16,666
I'm going to see it through,
prison term and everything.

1239
01:37:16,741 --> 01:37:19,266
Prison? You mean Melbeck,
that money you took?

1240
01:37:19,344 --> 01:37:20,742
I can't pay it back.

1241
01:37:20,811 --> 01:37:24,042
I made the last attempt to raise the money
when I went away with Beaky.

1242
01:37:24,114 --> 01:37:26,082
- Paris?
- I went to Liverpool.

1243
01:37:26,149 --> 01:37:29,675
I tried to borrow on your insurance,
but it didn't work.

1244
01:37:29,919 --> 01:37:32,114
You were in Liverpool when Beaky...

1245
01:37:32,188 --> 01:37:34,418
Then you didn't go to Paris.

1246
01:37:34,490 --> 01:37:35,615
Of course not.

1247
01:37:35,690 --> 01:37:39,456
You think I'd have let some idiot
give poor old Beaky that brandy if I had?

1248
01:37:40,595 --> 01:37:44,724
Johnnie, if I'd only known.
This is as much my fault as yours.

1249
01:37:45,466 --> 01:37:48,902
I was only thinking of myself,
not what you were going through.

1250
01:37:48,969 --> 01:37:51,904
If I'd been really close to you,
you could've confided in me...

1251
01:37:51,972 --> 01:37:55,099
but you were afraid to.
You were ashamed to come to me.

1252
01:37:55,174 --> 01:37:57,108
If I'd only understood.

1253
01:37:59,911 --> 01:38:02,937
But it will be different now.
We'll make it different.

1254
01:38:03,849 --> 01:38:06,977
People don't change overnight, Lina.
I'm no good.

1255
01:38:07,818 --> 01:38:11,413
Let's turn back. Let's go home
and see it all through together.

1256
01:38:11,489 --> 01:38:14,184
No. It won't work.
I'm driving you on to your mother's.

1257
01:38:14,257 --> 01:38:17,420
It will work. I know it
will, Johnnie, please.

1258
01:38:17,694 --> 01:38:19,821
This isn't your problem, Lina.

1259
01:38:20,363 --> 01:38:22,489
But it is. You can't shut me out.

1260
01:38:22,564 --> 01:38:26,193
Turn the car around and let's go home.
Please, Johnnie.

1261
01:38:26,935 --> 01:38:28,596
No, Lina.

1262
01:38:30,705 --> 01:38:32,195
My darling.
