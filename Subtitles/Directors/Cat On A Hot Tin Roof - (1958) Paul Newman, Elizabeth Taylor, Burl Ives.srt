1
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,650
We want Pollitt! Brick Pollitt!

2
00:02:30,944 --> 00:02:36,454
We want Pollitt! Brick Pollitt!

3
00:04:05,246 --> 00:04:06,496
Don't you do that.

4
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm warning you, Trixie.

5
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:11,417
Gooper, can't you stop that child of yours

6
00:04:11,586 --> 00:04:13,666
from putting her hot little hands
in the ice cream?

7
00:04:13,838 --> 00:04:16,338
Trixie!

8
00:04:17,675 --> 00:04:20,965
Couldn't you at least wash your hands
before you did that?

9
00:04:32,273 --> 00:04:34,693
Maggie, you stop that!

10
00:04:34,859 --> 00:04:37,739
Maggie, how could you do that to a child?

11
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:40,029
Like this, honey.

12
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:51,288
- Gooper, did you see what she did?
- Huh?

13
00:04:51,876 --> 00:04:54,416
- I told her to wash her hands first.
- Oh!

14
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:13,901
One of those no-neck monsters
hit me with some ice cream.

15
00:05:14,565 --> 00:05:17,395
Now, why did you call Gooper's kiddies
no-neck monsters?

16
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:19,778
Because your brother's children
got no necks, that's why.

17
00:05:19,946 --> 00:05:20,986
Oh.

18
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:22,485
At least, none visible.

19
00:05:22,657 --> 00:05:26,703
Their fat little heads sit on their fat
little bodies without a bit of connection.

20
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:28,039
That's too bad.

21
00:05:28,204 --> 00:05:31,421
Specially 'cause you can't wring their necks
if they've not got any necks to wring.

22
00:05:31,582 --> 00:05:33,542
Isn't that right, honey?

23
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:36,090
Trixie, come on.

24
00:05:36,254 --> 00:05:37,514
Here we are!

25
00:05:37,672 --> 00:05:39,052
Come on, Buster, Sonny.

26
00:05:39,215 --> 00:05:41,675
Come on. Everybody in the car now.
We're all going to go.

27
00:05:43,845 --> 00:05:46,885
Did you ever hear so many
dogs' names tacked on to children?

28
00:05:47,056 --> 00:05:50,516
Think of it. They've got five monsters
and number six coming up.

29
00:05:50,685 --> 00:05:54,605
Grab the whole bunch down here
like animals to display at a county fair.

30
00:05:54,772 --> 00:05:58,992
It's so obvious, it's disgusting.
Well, it's obvious what they're up to.

31
00:05:59,694 --> 00:06:01,954
What are they up to, Maggie?

32
00:06:03,906 --> 00:06:06,446
I'll tell you what they're up to,
boy of mine.

33
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:10,287
They're up to cutting you out of
your father's estate.

34
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:13,963
Everybody knows Big Daddy's dying of...

35
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,630
Oh, I ought to send Sister Woman
a bill for a new pair of stockings.

36
00:06:20,131 --> 00:06:22,631
- Do we?
- Do we what?

37
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,760
Know that Big Daddy is dying of...

38
00:06:27,472 --> 00:06:29,142
Don't you believe it?

39
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:31,429
You'll know soon enough.

40
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:33,312
Suppose he is?

41
00:06:33,478 --> 00:06:35,438
There's some things you got to face, baby.

42
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:38,976
There's some things in this world
you've simply got to face.

43
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:42,280
Why did they have Big Daddy
in that horrible old clinic for six weeks?

44
00:06:42,445 --> 00:06:44,065
If the examination didn't show anything

45
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:47,278
then why'd Brother Man bring
his whole screaming tribe down here

46
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:49,290
in this sticky heat?

47
00:06:49,619 --> 00:06:52,499
And why so many allusions
to you and Rainbow Hill?

48
00:06:53,081 --> 00:06:54,621
You know what Rainbow Hill is?

49
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:58,461
It's a place that's famous for treating
famous alcoholics and dope fiends.

50
00:06:58,628 --> 00:07:01,168
- I'm not famous, Maggie.
- No.

51
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:03,089
And you don't take dope.

52
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:05,967
Otherwise you'd be a perfect candidate
for Rainbow Hill.

53
00:07:06,135 --> 00:07:09,675
That's where Brother Man's
going to tell Big Daddy to ship you.

54
00:07:09,972 --> 00:07:11,932
Over my dead body.

55
00:07:12,475 --> 00:07:13,975
Rainbow Hill.

56
00:07:17,313 --> 00:07:20,533
And if they get you out of the way,
brother Gooper gets ahold of the estate

57
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:23,951
and signs all the checks, and cuts off
our credit whenever he wants.

58
00:07:24,112 --> 00:07:26,202
How would you like that, baby?

59
00:07:26,531 --> 00:07:28,491
You're doing just about everything you can

60
00:07:28,658 --> 00:07:32,538
to aid and abet them
in grabbing control after Big Daddy...

61
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:40,381
Well, you are.

62
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:43,798
Quitting work, devoting yourself
to the occupation of drinking.

63
00:07:43,965 --> 00:07:47,635
Breaking your ankle last night
on the high school athletic field.

64
00:07:48,344 --> 00:07:49,554
Brick?

65
00:07:50,805 --> 00:07:53,135
We got one thing on our side.

66
00:07:53,641 --> 00:07:56,351
No, two things. Are my seams straight?

67
00:07:57,728 --> 00:07:59,688
Big Daddy dotes on you, honey.

68
00:07:59,856 --> 00:08:02,856
He just can't stand Brother Man
and Brother Man's wife,

69
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:06,565
that monster of fertility.
She's downright odious to him. I can tell.

70
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:08,907
Just like I can tell he likes me.

71
00:08:09,073 --> 00:08:12,033
That's the second thing
we got on our side.

72
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:18,751
He likes me.

73
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:23,881
The way he looks me up and down, over.

74
00:08:25,423 --> 00:08:29,433
- He's still got an eye for girls.
- That kind of talk is disgusting.

75
00:08:31,262 --> 00:08:34,602
Anybody ever tell you
you were a back-aching Puritan, Brick?

76
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:38,435
I think it's mighty fine the way
that old fellow on the doorstep of death

77
00:08:38,603 --> 00:08:42,403
still takes in my shape with
what I consider deserved appreciation.

78
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:45,194
You know, that brother Gooper of yours

79
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:48,609
still cherishes the illusion he took
a giant step up the social ladder

80
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:51,969
when he married Mae Flynn
of the no-neck Memphis Flynns.

81
00:08:52,182 --> 00:08:54,912
Because she was Queen
of the Cotton Carnival.

82
00:08:55,119 --> 00:08:58,039
Oh, I can just see Gooper
falling for Her Majesty.

83
00:08:58,206 --> 00:09:02,286
Sitting on that brass throne, riding
on that tacky float down Main Street.

84
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:07,133
Smiling and bowing and blowing
kisses to all the trash on the street.

85
00:09:08,466 --> 00:09:10,796
You know what happened to her?

86
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:13,263
No, what happened to her, Maggie?

87
00:09:13,596 --> 00:09:17,096
Somebody spat tobacco juice in her face.
That's right.

88
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:20,306
Some drunk at the Hotel Gayoso
leaned out the window and said,

89
00:09:20,478 --> 00:09:23,308
"Hey, Queenie. Hey, there, Queenie."

90
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:26,984
Sister Mae looked up and smiled and waved,

91
00:09:27,151 --> 00:09:32,323
and that drunk shot a squirt of
tobacco juice... right in her face.

92
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:46,882
Why are you looking at me like that?

93
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:52,090
- Like what, Maggie?
- Like you were just looking.

94
00:09:54,136 --> 00:09:56,806
I wasn't conscious
of looking at you, Maggie.

95
00:10:01,102 --> 00:10:02,692
I was conscious of it.

96
00:10:12,697 --> 00:10:14,527
If you were thinking
the same thing I was...

97
00:10:14,699 --> 00:10:16,529
- No, Maggie.
- Why not?

98
00:10:16,701 --> 00:10:20,121
- Will you please keep your voice down?
- No!

99
00:10:21,163 --> 00:10:23,213
I know you better than you think.

100
00:10:23,374 --> 00:10:27,214
I've seen that look before
and I know what it used to mean.

101
00:10:27,503 --> 00:10:32,053
- And it still means the same thing now.
- You're not the same woman now, Maggie.

102
00:10:32,425 --> 00:10:34,715
Oh, don't you think I know that?

103
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:37,722
- Don't you think I know...
- Know what, Maggie?

104
00:10:38,055 --> 00:10:41,225
That I've gone through
this horrible transformation.

105
00:10:41,392 --> 00:10:43,732
I've become hard and frantic and cruel.

106
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:46,864
You planning on meeting Big Daddy's plane?

107
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:50,571
Oh, Brick.

108
00:10:54,572 --> 00:10:58,412
- I get so lonely.
- Everybody gets that.

109
00:11:01,037 --> 00:11:06,583
Living with somebody you love can be
lonelier than living entirely alone

110
00:11:07,918 --> 00:11:10,378
when the one you love doesn't love you.

111
00:11:21,349 --> 00:11:24,519
You can't even stand drinking
out of the same glass, can you?

112
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:27,685
- Would you like to live alone, Maggie?
- No!

113
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:34,815
No, I wouldn't.

114
00:11:38,574 --> 00:11:41,124
Why can't you lose your good looks, Brick?

115
00:11:41,494 --> 00:11:44,754
Most drinking men lose theirs.
Why can't you?

116
00:11:46,082 --> 00:11:50,042
I think you've even gotten better-looking
since you went on the bottle.

117
00:11:53,214 --> 00:11:56,554
- You were such a wonderful lover.
- You'll be late!

118
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,100
You were so exciting to be in love with.
Mostly, I guess, because you were...

119
00:12:08,104 --> 00:12:12,484
If I thought you'd
never, never make love to me again,

120
00:12:16,195 --> 00:12:18,945
I'd find me the longest,
sharpest knife I could

121
00:12:19,115 --> 00:12:21,365
and I'd stick it straight into my heart.

122
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:23,202
I'd do that.

123
00:12:26,914 --> 00:12:31,630
Oh, Brick, how long does this
have to go on, this punishment?

124
00:12:31,794 --> 00:12:34,674
Haven't I served my term?
Can't I apply for a pardon?

125
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:36,589
Lady, that finishing-school voice of yours

126
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:41,097
sounds like you was running upstairs
to tell somebody the house was on fire.

127
00:12:41,429 --> 00:12:43,099
Is it any wonder?

128
00:12:44,223 --> 00:12:46,313
You know what I feel like?

129
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:49,145
I feel all the time
like a cat on a hot tin roof.

130
00:12:49,311 --> 00:12:51,021
Then jump off the roof, Maggie.
Jump off it.

131
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:54,858
Now, cats jump off roofs
and they land uninjured. Do it. Jump.

132
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:58,645
- Jump where? Into what?
- Take a lover.

133
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,620
I don't deserve that.

134
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:12,416
I can't see any man but you.

135
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:17,380
Even with my eyes closed, I just see you.

136
00:13:22,678 --> 00:13:25,008
Why can't you get ugly, Brick?

137
00:13:25,181 --> 00:13:29,521
Why can't you please get fat or ugly
or something, so I can stand it?

138
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:33,654
You'll make out fine.
Your kind always does.

139
00:13:34,148 --> 00:13:37,778
Oh, I'm more determined than you think.
I'll win all right.

140
00:13:38,486 --> 00:13:39,856
Win what?

141
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:44,698
What is the victory
of a cat on a hot tin roof?

142
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:51,246
Just staying on it, I guess.

143
00:13:51,707 --> 00:13:53,377
Long as she can.

144
00:14:05,763 --> 00:14:08,813
Calm down. Not now.
Now wait a minute. Not yet.

145
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:13,154
- Where are the flowers, darling?
- Aren't you putting it on a little thick?

146
00:14:31,539 --> 00:14:33,079
Get ready now.

147
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:36,040
Mama, she didn't bring anything
for Big Daddy.

148
00:14:36,252 --> 00:14:39,552
Pretty seedy-looking flowers
for Big Daddy, don't you think, Gooper?

149
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:41,053
I picked them myself.

150
00:14:41,215 --> 00:14:43,125
Looks like she picked them
off somebody's grave.

151
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,590
Now you stop talking about graves

152
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:48,180
when we don't know
whether Big Daddy's going to live or die.

153
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:53,598
Get ready.

154
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:00,649
Hi. Hello, Mae.

155
00:15:01,277 --> 00:15:02,947
Hello, children.

156
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:18,712
Don't they look great?

157
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:25,341
Kiss me.

158
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:26,719
- Mae, darling.
- You look wonderful.

159
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:28,215
Kiss your grandmother.

160
00:15:28,429 --> 00:15:30,349
Oh, darling Big Daddy.

161
00:15:30,514 --> 00:15:32,984
You look fine, Big Daddy. Just fine.

162
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:35,345
Doc, you want to tell them the news?

163
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:39,976
The exploratory operation proved
there's nothing wrong with Big Daddy.

164
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:41,689
Nothing at all!

165
00:15:41,859 --> 00:15:44,399
Just a little old spastic colon.
And that's all.

166
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,160
- That's great news.
- Isn't that great news?

167
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:49,534
That's the best birthday present of all.

168
00:15:49,992 --> 00:15:51,122
Where's Brick?

169
00:15:51,285 --> 00:15:53,535
Uncle Brick got drunk and broke his leg.

170
00:15:53,704 --> 00:15:54,914
- How?
- What's that?

171
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,421
Yeah. Seems he got drunk again and tried to
jump the hurdles at 3:00 in the morning.

172
00:15:58,751 --> 00:16:00,881
That poor boy thinks
he's still a great, big athlete.

173
00:16:01,045 --> 00:16:02,915
Couldn't keep it out of the local paper.

174
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:04,508
AP got a hold of it, too.

175
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:06,343
Yeah, and UP,

176
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:10,638
and, thanks to your professional
legal advice, every other "P."

177
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:12,014
Let's go home.

178
00:16:12,181 --> 00:16:14,521
Don't you want to ride
with the children, honey?

179
00:16:14,683 --> 00:16:16,273
No!

180
00:16:17,478 --> 00:16:19,978
He is his sassy old self again, all right.

181
00:16:20,314 --> 00:16:22,564
Be quiet, woman!

182
00:16:30,449 --> 00:16:31,739
Hush up!

183
00:16:42,503 --> 00:16:44,093
Welcome home, Captain Pollitt.

184
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:55,806
I'm going to live, Maggie.
I'm going to live.

185
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:59,060
You know, they had me real scared.

186
00:16:59,311 --> 00:17:01,111
You know, I've wasted so much time.

187
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:04,401
You know, I've got a million different
kinds of feelings left in me.

188
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:07,896
And I want to use them.
I'm going to use them all.

189
00:17:47,818 --> 00:17:51,358
Why did you and Brick suddenly
decide to drive up from New Orleans?

190
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:53,490
For your birthday, what else?

191
00:17:53,657 --> 00:17:56,947
I had a birthday last year
and the year before. Didn't see you then.

192
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:59,199
You know how Brick is sometimes.

193
00:17:59,371 --> 00:18:02,331
Maybe he thought he was coming
to my funeral instead of my birthday.

194
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:07,039
Why, Brick loves you. He does.

195
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:10,014
But does he love you?

196
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:12,837
What do you want? Proof?

197
00:18:14,136 --> 00:18:18,136
If I was married to you three years,
you'd have the living proof.

198
00:18:18,307 --> 00:18:20,887
You'd have three kids already
and the fourth in the oven.

199
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:22,599
We love you out of sight

200
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:24,650
We love you in the morning
We love you in the night

201
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:26,573
Get me out of this.
I want to talk to Brick.

202
00:18:26,732 --> 00:18:28,902
Big Daddy

203
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:36,155
He wants some more ice, Miss Margaret.

204
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,290
We love you in the morning

205
00:18:38,452 --> 00:18:40,082
We love you in the night

206
00:18:40,245 --> 00:18:43,542
We love you when we're with you
And we love you out of sight

207
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:51,214
Big Momma, too

208
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:07,151
Brick. I got news, honey. Big news.

209
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:09,819
Big Daddy's gonna live.

210
00:19:12,194 --> 00:19:14,744
That's right, he's a well man.

211
00:19:14,947 --> 00:19:18,617
That's what Big Momma said
and Doc Baugh was right there with them.

212
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:21,449
You should've seen Mae and Gooper's face.

213
00:19:21,662 --> 00:19:24,582
Ha. They almost dropped dead
from shock themselves.

214
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:28,878
- He's all right?
- Feeling like 40. Talking like 20.

215
00:19:29,044 --> 00:19:31,214
Then we can drive back
to New Orleans tonight.

216
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,470
- I'm taking no chances on moving you.
- I won't break.

217
00:19:34,633 --> 00:19:38,103
Or letting them poison
Big Daddy's mind against you.

218
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:43,179
I just want you to get dressed and come
on down to Big Daddy's birthday party.

219
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:46,690
First thing Big Daddy
asked about was you...

220
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:49,605
Big Daddy. Now what makes him so big?

221
00:19:50,357 --> 00:19:54,107
His big heart, his big belly,
or his big money?

222
00:19:55,487 --> 00:19:58,987
- The heat has made you cross.
- Mmm-hmm. Give me my crutch.

223
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,660
Why don't you put on
your nice silk pajamas, honey,

224
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,790
and come on down to the party?

225
00:20:06,957 --> 00:20:09,247
There's a lovely cool breeze.

226
00:20:10,002 --> 00:20:11,922
Give me my crutch, Maggie.

227
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:14,840
Lean on me, baby.

228
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:24,473
Mmm, you got a nice smell about you.

229
00:20:26,602 --> 00:20:28,942
- Was your bath water cool?
- No.

230
00:20:31,023 --> 00:20:34,153
I know something
to make you feel cool and fresh.

231
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,860
Alcohol rub.

232
00:20:37,613 --> 00:20:38,953
Cologne.

233
00:20:39,865 --> 00:20:43,945
No, thanks. We'd smell alike.
Like a couple of cats in the heat.

234
00:20:54,212 --> 00:20:55,842
It's cool on the lawn.

235
00:20:56,006 --> 00:21:00,426
I am not going down there, Maggie.
Not for you and not for Big Daddy.

236
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:05,385
At least you can give him this present

237
00:21:05,557 --> 00:21:08,977
that I remembered to buy for you.
For his birthday.

238
00:21:09,645 --> 00:21:11,685
At least you can write a few words
on this card.

239
00:21:11,855 --> 00:21:13,315
You write something, Maggie.

240
00:21:13,482 --> 00:21:17,192
It's got to be your handwriting. It's your
present. It's got to be your handwriting.

241
00:21:17,361 --> 00:21:20,281
- I didn't get him a present.
- What's the difference?

242
00:21:20,447 --> 00:21:22,237
If there's no difference,
you write the card.

243
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:24,447
And have him know
you didn't remember his birthday?

244
00:21:24,618 --> 00:21:25,698
I didn't remember!

245
00:21:25,869 --> 00:21:27,909
You don't have to prove it to him!

246
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,080
Just write, "Love, Brick"
for heaven's sakes.

247
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:32,539
- No.
- You've got to.

248
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:34,629
I don't have to do anything
I don't want to.

249
00:21:34,795 --> 00:21:38,085
You keep forgetting the conditions on
which I agreed to stay on living with you!

250
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:42,256
I'm not living with you.
We occupy the same cage, that's all.

251
00:21:50,852 --> 00:21:55,442
You know, that's the first time
you've raised your voice in a long time.

252
00:21:58,235 --> 00:22:00,025
A crack in the stone wall?

253
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:08,789
I think that's a fine sign. Mighty fine.

254
00:22:14,251 --> 00:22:16,551
Now what did you do that for, Maggie?

255
00:22:19,548 --> 00:22:22,428
To give us a little privacy for a while.

256
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:25,303
Don't make a fool of yourself, Maggie.

257
00:22:29,349 --> 00:22:32,059
I don't mind
making a fool of myself over you.

258
00:22:32,227 --> 00:22:36,647
- I mind. I feel embarrassed for you.
- Feel embarrassed!

259
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:39,029
But I can't live on this way.

260
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:43,362
- You agreed to accept that condition!
- I know I did, but I can't.

261
00:22:45,282 --> 00:22:46,492
Let go, Maggie.

262
00:22:53,123 --> 00:22:54,713
Let go, Maggie!

263
00:23:12,642 --> 00:23:15,442
Son!

264
00:23:16,521 --> 00:23:19,441
We got the most wonderful news
about Big Daddy.

265
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:21,436
What's this door locked for?

266
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:24,280
You don't think
there's robbers in the house?

267
00:23:24,696 --> 00:23:28,526
Uh, Brick's getting dressed, Big Momma.
He's still getting dressed.

268
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,290
So, it won't be the first time
I've seen Brick not dressed.

269
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:33,803
Come on. Open this door.

270
00:23:43,965 --> 00:23:46,965
Brick, honey.
Sweetheart, how's your leg feel?

271
00:23:47,135 --> 00:23:50,305
Come on out of there, son. I want to
give you the news about Big Daddy.

272
00:23:50,472 --> 00:23:52,272
I told him already.

273
00:23:52,808 --> 00:23:54,848
I just hate locked doors in the house.

274
00:23:55,018 --> 00:23:58,648
I know you do, but people got to have
some moments of privacy, don't they?

275
00:23:58,814 --> 00:24:00,944
No, ma'am, not in my house.

276
00:24:01,108 --> 00:24:04,608
What'd you took this off for, honey?
That looked so sweet on you.

277
00:24:04,778 --> 00:24:07,608
Not sweet enough
for Big Daddy's birthday party.

278
00:24:08,615 --> 00:24:10,945
Out! Out! Out!

279
00:24:11,118 --> 00:24:12,828
Out, you little monster!

280
00:24:20,127 --> 00:24:23,507
Mae and Gooper are so touchy
about their children.

281
00:24:23,672 --> 00:24:27,632
You hardly even dare suggest
there's any room for improvement.

282
00:24:27,843 --> 00:24:29,433
Brick, hurry on out!

283
00:24:29,594 --> 00:24:32,514
Oh, shoot, Maggie,
you just don't like children.

284
00:24:32,722 --> 00:24:36,392
Why, that's not true. I adore them.
Well brought up.

285
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,190
Why don't you have some then?
And bring them up well.

286
00:24:39,354 --> 00:24:41,364
Instead of all the time
picking on Gooper and Mae's?

287
00:24:41,523 --> 00:24:43,653
Hey, Big Momma! You and Betsy got to go.

288
00:24:43,817 --> 00:24:45,397
They're waiting downstairs to say goodbye.

289
00:24:45,569 --> 00:24:48,859
Be right down in a jiffy.
Tell them to hold their horses.

290
00:24:49,823 --> 00:24:51,373
Where's Brick?

291
00:24:57,372 --> 00:24:58,542
Oh.

292
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:03,500
Big Momma, what you said
about having children,

293
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:05,590
it's still kind of a secret, but...

294
00:25:05,755 --> 00:25:06,755
Huh?

295
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:10,300
Oh, shoot, Maggie. Stop playing so dumb.

296
00:25:10,594 --> 00:25:13,314
I mean,
is he still drinking this stuff much?

297
00:25:13,513 --> 00:25:17,353
- Oh! He may have had a little highball.
- Don't laugh about it.

298
00:25:17,601 --> 00:25:20,351
Some single men stop drinking
when they get married. Others start.

299
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,610
- Brick never touched liquor before...
- That's not fair!

300
00:25:22,772 --> 00:25:26,072
Fair or not fair, I want to
ask you a question. One question.

301
00:25:26,234 --> 00:25:28,284
Do you make Brick happy?

302
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:29,990
Well?

303
00:25:32,782 --> 00:25:35,242
- Why don't you ask if he makes me happy?
- I know...

304
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:36,450
It works both ways.

305
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:40,750
Something ain't right.
You're childless and my son drinks.

306
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:43,956
- We're leaving, Big Momma.
- I'm coming!

307
00:25:44,211 --> 00:25:49,296
When a marriage goes on the rocks,
the rocks are there, right there.

308
00:25:49,466 --> 00:25:50,836
Goodbye, Ida.

309
00:25:51,009 --> 00:25:52,409
I'm coming.

310
00:25:58,808 --> 00:26:00,478
That's not fair.

311
00:26:01,269 --> 00:26:03,189
All right, I'm coming.

312
00:26:08,068 --> 00:26:09,608
Is Brick here?

313
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:12,743
I thought I'd check his ankle.

314
00:26:13,365 --> 00:26:14,815
Is it giving him much pain, Maggie?

315
00:26:14,991 --> 00:26:18,451
Oh, you know how Brick is, Doc.
He hardly ever complains.

316
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:21,960
Even when he had
that awful back injury in football.

317
00:26:22,123 --> 00:26:23,333
Brick.

318
00:26:24,334 --> 00:26:27,134
Brick's birthday present for Big Daddy.

319
00:26:27,879 --> 00:26:30,879
I think they're fixing to
sit down to table.

320
00:26:33,677 --> 00:26:34,677
Oh...

321
00:26:35,345 --> 00:26:38,215
You forgot to write out the card, honey.

322
00:26:38,848 --> 00:26:39,848
Hmm?

323
00:26:41,434 --> 00:26:42,524
Thanks, Doc.

324
00:26:49,985 --> 00:26:53,025
- Can I get you something cool, Doc?
- Thanks.

325
00:26:53,571 --> 00:26:55,241
How's the ankle?

326
00:26:58,326 --> 00:26:59,786
Itches some.

327
00:27:00,662 --> 00:27:04,542
Funny, that's the same leg
you tore a muscle in the... What was it?

328
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:06,168
- 'Bama State.
- Yeah.

329
00:27:06,334 --> 00:27:08,674
- Twenty-one to...
- Nothing.

330
00:27:08,837 --> 00:27:11,127
You miss football, don't you?

331
00:27:11,298 --> 00:27:14,298
- Hurt much when you put weight on it?
- Some.

332
00:27:14,592 --> 00:27:17,682
Yeah, you were quite a team,
you and Skipper.

333
00:27:20,682 --> 00:27:22,352
What is it, Doc?

334
00:27:22,767 --> 00:27:26,017
You didn't leave that party just to
come up here and discuss my health.

335
00:27:26,187 --> 00:27:27,187
That's right.

336
00:27:27,355 --> 00:27:30,605
- I already heard the good news about...
- It's bad news.

337
00:27:30,859 --> 00:27:32,779
It's what we expected.

338
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:37,160
It's malignant and it's terminal.
He hasn't a chance.

339
00:27:37,866 --> 00:27:40,656
- But Maggie said, and Big Momma...
- Lies.

340
00:27:41,536 --> 00:27:43,116
I lied to them.

341
00:27:43,788 --> 00:27:45,788
And I lied to him, too.

342
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:49,247
Professional ethics.

343
00:27:49,711 --> 00:27:50,841
Gooper?

344
00:27:51,004 --> 00:27:53,924
I told him the truth
coming in from the airfield.

345
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:55,840
He's going to die?

346
00:27:57,302 --> 00:27:58,852
He's gonna die.

347
00:28:07,771 --> 00:28:10,821
Jesus wants me for a sunbeam

348
00:28:10,982 --> 00:28:13,492
To shine for him each day

349
00:28:13,651 --> 00:28:15,821
What kind of truth is that?

350
00:28:35,298 --> 00:28:38,508
Jesus wants me for a sunbeam

351
00:28:38,676 --> 00:28:42,006
To shine for Him each day

352
00:28:42,514 --> 00:28:45,734
In every way try to please Him

353
00:28:45,892 --> 00:28:49,062
At home, at school, at play

354
00:28:49,229 --> 00:28:52,819
A sunbeam, a sunbeam

355
00:28:52,982 --> 00:28:56,322
Jesus wants me for a sunbeam

356
00:28:56,486 --> 00:28:59,656
A sunbeam, a sunbeam

357
00:28:59,823 --> 00:29:02,533
I'll be a sunbeam for Him

358
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,620
Amen.

359
00:29:04,828 --> 00:29:08,328
- Did you like the singing, Big Daddy?
- Pass the black-eyed peas.

360
00:29:08,498 --> 00:29:11,998
Just look at Big Daddy eat. Ain't it
something to thank your stars for?

361
00:29:12,168 --> 00:29:15,338
- They've been practicing just for you.
- Tell them to sit down and eat.

362
00:29:15,505 --> 00:29:17,505
- Children, come on.
- Over there.

363
00:29:17,674 --> 00:29:19,344
Yeah. Over there.

364
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,220
Look here. Telegrams.

365
00:29:22,387 --> 00:29:25,057
Hundreds of telegrams
from every corner of this great state.

366
00:29:25,223 --> 00:29:26,603
Wishing you happy birthday.

367
00:29:26,766 --> 00:29:28,346
- You want me to read them?
- No.

368
00:29:28,518 --> 00:29:30,518
One from the Governor,
United States Senator...

369
00:29:30,687 --> 00:29:33,567
It must be getting on
to election time, hey, Deacon?

370
00:29:33,731 --> 00:29:36,731
Let's remember, we're all lambs
in the same pasture.

371
00:29:36,901 --> 00:29:40,861
Everybody here, including Big Daddy,
owes thanks to those in high places who...

372
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:42,200
Gave us nothing.

373
00:29:42,365 --> 00:29:46,365
Every scrap on this table was raised
right here on this place, Deacon.

374
00:29:46,578 --> 00:29:50,868
I made a pastureland out of this place
when it was nothing but a swamp.

375
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,250
And it was done with the help of God,
and not any governor.

376
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:55,419
Amen.

377
00:29:55,587 --> 00:29:57,547
Boom, boom and it makes me crazy

378
00:29:57,714 --> 00:30:00,474
- Great balls of fire!
- Surprise!

379
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:03,893
- What are they up to now?
- It's all just part of the entertainment.

380
00:30:04,053 --> 00:30:07,223
- Don't they get any intermission?
- That's funny.

381
00:30:08,057 --> 00:30:09,557
That's very funny.

382
00:30:09,726 --> 00:30:12,096
He don't mean it, Sister Woman.

383
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:14,770
- He loves children.
- Of course he does.

384
00:30:14,939 --> 00:30:17,149
Will you put some honey on this?

385
00:30:17,317 --> 00:30:20,397
They're all Pollitts, I'm proud to say,
every one of them.

386
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:23,240
And I know that Big Daddy's
just as proud as we are,

387
00:30:23,406 --> 00:30:27,985
knowing there's a whole dynasty of his
flesh and blood waiting to take over.

388
00:30:28,328 --> 00:30:31,498
- Why, that's no way to talk.
- What way?

389
00:30:31,664 --> 00:30:35,084
- "Take over." When we all know...
- I just meant...

390
00:30:35,251 --> 00:30:37,921
...Big Daddy's going to live to be
at least 100.

391
00:30:38,254 --> 00:30:42,634
- I'll drink to that.
- Anytime, anyplace, anywhere.

392
00:30:42,842 --> 00:30:44,872
To Big Daddy.

393
00:30:45,929 --> 00:30:48,769
In the name of every man, woman,
and child in this here county,

394
00:30:48,932 --> 00:30:52,102
in the name of the church board,
the school board, the board of trustees,

395
00:30:52,268 --> 00:30:55,018
felicitations on your 65th birthday.

396
00:30:57,023 --> 00:30:59,363
Brick, honey,
I brought you something to eat.

397
00:30:59,526 --> 00:31:01,106
I'm not hungry.

398
00:31:04,531 --> 00:31:07,621
- What's that supposed to mean?
- We're leaving.

399
00:31:07,784 --> 00:31:09,454
- We can't.
- I can.

400
00:31:09,619 --> 00:31:11,699
They're bringing the whole party
up here to you.

401
00:31:11,871 --> 00:31:13,871
If you won't drive me,
I'll get one of the boys to do it.

402
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:17,500
You just can't walk out
on Big Daddy's birthday party.

403
00:31:17,669 --> 00:31:21,669
- Don't you care nothing about him?
- Get out of my way, Maggie.

404
00:31:22,298 --> 00:31:24,468
Get out of my way, Maggie.

405
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,640
You got no cause to dislike him.

406
00:31:31,307 --> 00:31:32,677
Do I dislike him?

407
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:36,150
It's obvious to everybody.
Especially to him.

408
00:31:41,067 --> 00:31:43,527
What's he ever done to you? What?

409
00:31:44,153 --> 00:31:48,033
Why do you hate him so much?
What's he ever done to you?

410
00:31:51,744 --> 00:31:52,834
Nothing.

411
00:31:54,497 --> 00:31:56,997
What was Doc Baugh doing up here?

412
00:31:58,418 --> 00:31:59,998
What did he...

413
00:32:04,841 --> 00:32:07,091
That's right, Big Daddy is going to die.

414
00:32:10,346 --> 00:32:12,216
I don't believe that.

415
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:17,349
- Doc Baugh wouldn't lie to Big Daddy.
- Wouldn't he, Maggie?

416
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:21,690
Oh...

417
00:32:22,442 --> 00:32:24,032
Poor Big Daddy.

418
00:32:25,695 --> 00:32:29,865
I'm fond of him.
I'm genuinely fond of that old man.

419
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,620
I really am, you know.

420
00:32:33,953 --> 00:32:36,173
Oh, when he finds out...

421
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,960
I wouldn't want to be the one to tell him.

422
00:32:42,086 --> 00:32:43,706
That's why you want to go now.

423
00:32:45,381 --> 00:32:48,091
Yeah, that's why I want to leave now.

424
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,260
You got to do this for me, Maggie. Please.

425
00:32:53,431 --> 00:32:56,811
And leave the field to Gooper
and that wife of his? No, sir.

426
00:32:56,976 --> 00:32:58,556
Let's face facts, baby.

427
00:32:58,728 --> 00:33:01,898
- You're a drinker, and that takes money.
- I don't want his money.

428
00:33:02,065 --> 00:33:04,105
You're ready to settle for ten-cent beer?

429
00:33:04,275 --> 00:33:07,485
'Cause that's just what Gooper will dole
out to you when they freeze you out.

430
00:33:07,654 --> 00:33:09,574
They got a plan, baby.

431
00:33:10,114 --> 00:33:14,454
Oh, you should've heard them laying it
on to Big Daddy. A mile a minute.

432
00:33:14,827 --> 00:33:17,407
Big Momma's already on their side.

433
00:33:17,914 --> 00:33:20,464
You're a drinker and I'm childless.

434
00:33:21,793 --> 00:33:24,753
We got to beat that plan, we just got to.

435
00:33:28,341 --> 00:33:32,431
I've been so disgustingly poor
all my life.

436
00:33:33,846 --> 00:33:35,926
That's the truth, Brick.

437
00:33:37,266 --> 00:33:38,976
Have you, Maggie?

438
00:33:41,354 --> 00:33:43,314
You don't know what it's like to have to

439
00:33:43,481 --> 00:33:47,531
suck up to people you can't stand
just 'cause they have money.

440
00:33:47,694 --> 00:33:52,203
You don't know what it's like
never having any clothes.

441
00:33:53,324 --> 00:33:55,544
That dress I married you in

442
00:33:55,702 --> 00:33:59,212
was a hand-me-down
from a snotty rich cousin I hated.

443
00:34:01,958 --> 00:34:04,288
You can be young without money.

444
00:34:05,378 --> 00:34:07,798
But you can't be old without it.

445
00:34:10,299 --> 00:34:12,179
Where did I fail you?

446
00:34:13,052 --> 00:34:15,302
Where did I make my mistake?

447
00:34:16,806 --> 00:34:19,016
Make that your last drink
until after the party.

448
00:34:19,183 --> 00:34:21,023
Please, honey?

449
00:34:27,817 --> 00:34:31,147
I think I made my mistake
when I tried to tell you about Skipper.

450
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,030
- That's where I made my fatal error.
- Maggie.

451
00:34:33,197 --> 00:34:35,657
- I never should have confessed...
- Now you shut up about Skipper.

452
00:34:35,825 --> 00:34:37,695
I mean it.
You got to shut up about Skipper!

453
00:34:37,869 --> 00:34:40,579
The laws of silence won't work about that.

454
00:34:40,747 --> 00:34:42,577
Not about Skipper and us.

455
00:34:42,749 --> 00:34:46,749
It's like locking the door on the fire in
hopes of forgetting the house is burning.

456
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:48,549
Hey, everybody!

457
00:34:48,838 --> 00:34:52,008
But not looking at a fire
doesn't put it out.

458
00:34:52,884 --> 00:34:57,054
This time I'm going to finish.
That night in the hotel room,

459
00:34:57,221 --> 00:34:59,681
- Skipper and I...
- I don't want to hear about it.

460
00:34:59,849 --> 00:35:02,389
Why won't you face the truth just once?

461
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,440
About Skipper, about me, about yourself?

462
00:35:05,605 --> 00:35:07,055
- Hey, everybody!
- Brick, honey.

463
00:35:07,231 --> 00:35:09,191
Are you going to bring that party
up here or not?

464
00:35:09,358 --> 00:35:10,738
Kit and caboodle, son.

465
00:35:10,902 --> 00:35:13,912
That won't do any good.
I'm going to say this,

466
00:35:14,071 --> 00:35:16,031
and I don't care if it's in front of them.

467
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:17,409
Maggie.

468
00:35:18,618 --> 00:35:20,448
Do you want me
to hit you with this crutch?

469
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,540
You're still blaming me
for Skipper's death?

470
00:35:22,705 --> 00:35:24,745
Don't you know
that I could kill you with this crutch?

471
00:35:24,916 --> 00:35:27,126
Good lord, man,
do you think I'd care if you did?

472
00:35:27,293 --> 00:35:30,303
Skipper and I had a friendship.
Now why won't you let it alone!

473
00:35:30,463 --> 00:35:32,723
- It's got to be told.
- I don't want to hear it!

474
00:35:32,882 --> 00:35:36,302
It's got to be told
and you never let me tell it. I love you.

475
00:35:36,469 --> 00:35:39,259
And that's worth fighting for.
Not Skipper.

476
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:41,060
- Skipper was no good.
- Maggie.

477
00:35:41,224 --> 00:35:43,984
Maybe I'm no good either. Nobody's good.

478
00:35:44,143 --> 00:35:46,603
But, Brick, Skipper is dead!

479
00:35:46,771 --> 00:35:48,901
- And I'm alive!
- Maggie.

480
00:35:49,065 --> 00:35:52,435
Maggie The Cat is alive! I'm alive!

481
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:55,490
- Why are you afraid of the truth?
- Truth!

482
00:36:03,663 --> 00:36:07,503
Little girl, somebody ought to teach you

483
00:36:07,834 --> 00:36:10,254
to knock before you open a door.

484
00:36:10,753 --> 00:36:15,093
Otherwise, people might think
that you're lacking in good breeding.

485
00:36:19,053 --> 00:36:21,763
What's Uncle Brick doing on the floor?

486
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:25,599
I tried to kill your Aunt Maggie.

487
00:36:28,771 --> 00:36:30,271
But I failed.

488
00:36:30,731 --> 00:36:34,651
And I fell. Little girl,
would you hand me my crutch, please?

489
00:36:40,074 --> 00:36:42,834
What were you jumping high hurdles for?

490
00:36:43,452 --> 00:36:47,622
Because I used to jump them, and
people like to do what they used to do,

491
00:36:47,957 --> 00:36:50,667
after they've stopped being able to do it.

492
00:36:50,835 --> 00:36:53,795
That's right. And that's your answer.

493
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:56,340
Now go away, little girl.

494
00:36:57,508 --> 00:37:00,338
Stop that, you little no-neck monster!

495
00:37:00,511 --> 00:37:04,141
You're just jealous
'cause you can't have babies!

496
00:37:14,317 --> 00:37:15,607
You see?

497
00:37:17,153 --> 00:37:20,323
Mae and Gooper
gloat over us being childless,

498
00:37:22,366 --> 00:37:25,536
even in front of their
little no-neck monsters.

499
00:37:27,705 --> 00:37:28,995
Brick...

500
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:35,960
I went to a doctor in Memphis.
A gynecologist.

501
00:37:37,798 --> 00:37:41,548
He says there's no reason
why we can't have a child

502
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:43,469
whenever we want.

503
00:37:47,558 --> 00:37:48,848
Brick?

504
00:37:50,853 --> 00:37:53,903
- Are you listening?
- Yes, Maggie, I hear you.

505
00:37:55,816 --> 00:37:59,196
But how in hell on earth do you imagine
you're going to have a child

506
00:37:59,362 --> 00:38:01,702
by a man who cannot stand you?

507
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:12,209
That, boy of mine,

508
00:38:13,501 --> 00:38:16,881
is a problem I'll just have to work out.

509
00:38:17,046 --> 00:38:19,716
Here comes the party, here we come!

510
00:38:19,882 --> 00:38:22,762
Here comes that birthday party!

511
00:38:23,052 --> 00:38:24,512
That's nice.

512
00:38:26,597 --> 00:38:27,967
You should have seen the preacher's face
when I told him

513
00:38:28,224 --> 00:38:29,854
I got him a stained-glass memorial window.

514
00:38:30,017 --> 00:38:31,057
He like to bust out crying.

515
00:38:31,227 --> 00:38:33,057
Who did you get
to give you that window, Deacon?

516
00:38:33,229 --> 00:38:36,189
Clyde Fletcher's widow,
a great, generous woman of fine character.

517
00:38:36,357 --> 00:38:38,727
Somebody ought to give our churches
a cooling system.

518
00:38:38,901 --> 00:38:40,571
Yes sirree, Bob. Exactly my own thought.

519
00:38:40,736 --> 00:38:44,276
Let's see, they've had the typhoid shots
and the tetanus shots,

520
00:38:44,448 --> 00:38:48,368
diphtheria shots, hepatitis shots,
polio shots.

521
00:38:49,078 --> 00:38:50,748
- Uh, Gooper.
- Huh?

522
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,790
Gooper, honey, what all
have the kiddies been shot for?

523
00:38:53,958 --> 00:38:57,748
Everything but stealing chickens, I guess.

524
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,260
Very funny.

525
00:39:01,882 --> 00:39:03,592
Well, it does get hot out there, you know.

526
00:39:03,759 --> 00:39:05,219
Well, Brick?

527
00:39:05,386 --> 00:39:07,756
Congratulations, Big Daddy,
on your birthday.

528
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:09,140
- Bull.
- Do you know

529
00:39:09,306 --> 00:39:10,886
what Gus Hanna's family
gave in his memory?

530
00:39:11,058 --> 00:39:13,728
A complete new stone parish house
with a basketball court...

531
00:39:13,894 --> 00:39:15,444
- Deacon!
- Hmm?

532
00:39:15,604 --> 00:39:18,904
What's all this talk about
memorial stained-glass windows?

533
00:39:19,066 --> 00:39:21,936
Figuring on somebody
kicking over around here? Is that it?

534
00:39:22,111 --> 00:39:25,731
How about some nice music
to start the party off with?

535
00:39:29,618 --> 00:39:31,748
Turn that damn thing off!

536
00:39:33,664 --> 00:39:35,254
Where's my Brick?

537
00:39:35,416 --> 00:39:39,086
- Where's my precious baby?
- Sorry, turn it back on.

538
00:39:39,253 --> 00:39:40,803
How's your leg feel, honey?

539
00:39:40,963 --> 00:39:44,133
Your hand was made to hold something
better than that. Put that liquor down.

540
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:47,640
- Look at old Brick. He's putting it down.
- Turn that off!

541
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:51,310
How about a birthday kiss, honey?

542
00:39:55,686 --> 00:40:00,186
Hey, everybody, you know, the first time
Big Daddy kissed me, I fainted.

543
00:40:00,691 --> 00:40:03,071
It's a fact. Ain't that so, honey?

544
00:40:03,319 --> 00:40:07,619
You all know how he proposed to me?
I was four months swole with Gooper,

545
00:40:07,782 --> 00:40:10,872
and Big Daddy said,
"That's my kid, ain't it?"

546
00:40:11,035 --> 00:40:13,495
It was kind of funny. I never had a beau

547
00:40:13,662 --> 00:40:17,792
until I met your father.
He said, "I want that kid. I need him.

548
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:22,505
"He ain't going to have nobody else's
name but mine. Let's get the preacher.

549
00:40:22,671 --> 00:40:25,381
"That's what marriage is for. Family."

550
00:40:26,342 --> 00:40:29,182
Children were mighty important
to Big Daddy, even then.

551
00:40:29,345 --> 00:40:31,305
Ida, will you stop that yammering?

552
00:40:31,472 --> 00:40:34,732
Oh, that's just his manner of talking.
He don't mean it.

553
00:40:34,892 --> 00:40:38,062
I been his one and only lover,
haven't I, sweetheart?

554
00:40:38,229 --> 00:40:40,359
Ida, will you keep quiet?

555
00:40:41,148 --> 00:40:43,218
Children, come on.

556
00:40:47,488 --> 00:40:50,368
Here comes Big Daddy's birthday!

557
00:40:51,033 --> 00:40:53,703
Big Daddy's a jolly good fellow

558
00:40:53,869 --> 00:40:56,539
Big Daddy's a jolly good fellow

559
00:40:56,705 --> 00:41:00,035
Big Daddy's a jolly good fellow

560
00:41:00,209 --> 00:41:02,919
And so is Big Momma, too

561
00:41:03,087 --> 00:41:06,087
And so is Big Momma, too

562
00:41:06,257 --> 00:41:09,217
And so is Big Momma, too

563
00:41:09,385 --> 00:41:12,885
Big Daddy's a jolly good fellow

564
00:41:14,014 --> 00:41:17,394
And so is Big Momma, too

565
00:41:19,436 --> 00:41:24,066
- Ida, what the hell's the matter with you?
- Oh, she's just so happy, Big Daddy.

566
00:41:24,233 --> 00:41:27,903
I'm so happy.
I just got to cry or something.

567
00:41:28,195 --> 00:41:32,115
Oh, Brick, Big Daddy's 100% healthy.

568
00:41:32,283 --> 00:41:37,253
Uh, Brick, honey, aren't you going to give
Big Daddy his birthday present?

569
00:41:40,124 --> 00:41:42,194
Big Daddy.

570
00:41:45,129 --> 00:41:47,089
Big Daddy,
you got to open your birthday present.

571
00:41:47,256 --> 00:41:49,466
Open it up yourself.
I want to talk to Brick.

572
00:41:49,633 --> 00:41:51,593
Hey, Brick, come over here.

573
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,930
Hey, Brick, Big Daddy's calling you.

574
00:41:54,096 --> 00:41:56,926
Big Momma, take them out for me.

575
00:41:57,099 --> 00:42:00,899
- It's a cashmere robe.
- You sound surprised, Maggie.

576
00:42:01,145 --> 00:42:05,065
- I've never seen a cashmere robe before.
- That's funny.

577
00:42:06,108 --> 00:42:07,938
What's so funny about it?

578
00:42:08,444 --> 00:42:11,324
- All my family ever had was family.
- Ha!

579
00:42:11,572 --> 00:42:12,662
Quiet!

580
00:42:12,823 --> 00:42:16,163
- You bought it yourself last Saturday.
- I said quiet!

581
00:42:16,327 --> 00:42:19,287
I know, 'cause the salesgirl
that sold it to you waited on me

582
00:42:19,455 --> 00:42:20,745
and she told me about it.

583
00:42:20,915 --> 00:42:22,625
- Sister Woman...
- Quiet!

584
00:42:22,791 --> 00:42:25,291
...Stork and the Grim Reaper,
running neck and neck.

585
00:42:25,461 --> 00:42:26,671
- Deacon!
- Hmm?

586
00:42:27,296 --> 00:42:29,756
I hope I'm not butting in
on more talk about

587
00:42:29,924 --> 00:42:32,304
memorial stained-glass windows,
am I, Deacon?

588
00:42:32,468 --> 00:42:34,798
- Not at all.
- Yes, say, Deacon.

589
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:37,970
What do you get
out of all this charity work, anyway?

590
00:42:38,641 --> 00:42:40,981
I happen to love humanity.
That's my reward.

591
00:42:41,143 --> 00:42:43,983
And if humanity loves you back enough,
you might get elected

592
00:42:44,146 --> 00:42:46,146
councilman or mayor or something,
hey, Deacon?

593
00:42:46,315 --> 00:42:47,975
Now don't start picking on Deacon.

594
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:50,610
- That's all right. I was just about...
- Good night, Deacon.

595
00:42:50,778 --> 00:42:52,658
Exactly what I was about to say.

596
00:42:52,863 --> 00:42:54,703
I better be going
before it starts raining.

597
00:42:55,241 --> 00:42:58,331
Good night, everybody. Bless you all,
each and every one in this place.

598
00:42:58,494 --> 00:42:59,664
Brick.

599
00:42:59,995 --> 00:43:03,325
They tell me that you was indulging
in some athletics last night.

600
00:43:03,499 --> 00:43:06,839
- I was trying to, yes, sir.
- At 3:00 in the morning?

601
00:43:07,002 --> 00:43:09,512
What were you doing out there
on the high school athletic field

602
00:43:09,672 --> 00:43:11,012
at 3:00 in the morning?

603
00:43:11,173 --> 00:43:14,183
Jumping the hurdles.
I was running and jumping the hurdles.

604
00:43:14,343 --> 00:43:16,303
They got too high for me now.

605
00:43:16,553 --> 00:43:17,853
Because you were drunk.

606
00:43:18,013 --> 00:43:20,853
Sober, I would not have tried
to jump even the low ones.

607
00:43:21,016 --> 00:43:24,056
Big Daddy, it's time
to blow out the candles on your birthday.

608
00:43:24,228 --> 00:43:29,398
A toast to Big Daddy Pollitt
on his 65th birthday.

609
00:43:30,025 --> 00:43:31,775
To the biggest cotton planter...

610
00:43:31,986 --> 00:43:33,646
I told you to stop it now, quit this bull.

611
00:43:33,821 --> 00:43:37,071
I won't allow you to talk this way,
not even on your birthday.

612
00:43:37,241 --> 00:43:40,661
I'll talk like I want to on my birthday
or any other rotten day of the year.

613
00:43:40,828 --> 00:43:43,748
If anybody around here don't like it,
they know what they can do about it.

614
00:43:43,914 --> 00:43:46,754
- I know you don't mean that.
- You don't know nothing. You never did.

615
00:43:46,917 --> 00:43:50,377
- You don't mean that.
- Oh, yes, I do mean it.

616
00:43:51,922 --> 00:43:55,932
I've put up with a lot of bull around here
because I thought I was dying.

617
00:43:56,093 --> 00:43:58,723
That's when you started taking over.

618
00:43:58,887 --> 00:44:03,347
Your loud voice and your old busy body
butting in here, there and everywhere.

619
00:44:03,559 --> 00:44:07,099
Sashaying around here,
making a big noise like a boss.

620
00:44:07,563 --> 00:44:09,903
I'm the only boss around here.

621
00:44:10,357 --> 00:44:13,237
I built this place with no help from you.

622
00:44:13,569 --> 00:44:16,569
And I'll run this place
till the day I die.

623
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:20,410
Now, is that plain to you, Ida?
Is that perfectly clear to you?

624
00:44:20,576 --> 00:44:22,406
I ain't going to die.

625
00:44:22,578 --> 00:44:25,828
Ain't nothing wrong with me,
but a spastic colon!

626
00:44:26,206 --> 00:44:29,376
Made spastic, I reckon,
by all the lies and liars

627
00:44:29,543 --> 00:44:31,883
I've had to put up with around here.

628
00:44:32,046 --> 00:44:37,046
And all the hypocrisy I've had to live
with these 40 years I've lived with you.

629
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,930
Now, blow out them candles.

630
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:43,889
Go on. Blow out them candles
on that stupid cake.

631
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:47,730
Oh, Big Daddy,

632
00:44:48,771 --> 00:44:52,691
in all these years,
you never believed I loved you.

633
00:44:56,195 --> 00:44:57,565
And I did.

634
00:44:59,114 --> 00:45:00,704
I did so much.

635
00:45:02,117 --> 00:45:03,737
I did love you.

636
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:08,960
I even loved your hate and your hardness.

637
00:45:15,297 --> 00:45:19,127
- Big Daddy should make plans.
- If he should die before...

638
00:45:19,593 --> 00:45:20,973
Excuse me.

639
00:45:23,639 --> 00:45:24,889
Brick.

640
00:45:25,974 --> 00:45:27,314
Hey, son!

641
00:45:31,772 --> 00:45:33,612
I was calling Brick.

642
00:45:34,316 --> 00:45:37,316
I was just delivering him to you,
Big Daddy.

643
00:45:49,289 --> 00:45:51,789
- What'd you do that for?
- Do what?

644
00:45:53,377 --> 00:45:54,957
Wipe off her kiss?

645
00:45:58,340 --> 00:45:59,510
Did I?

646
00:45:59,675 --> 00:46:03,675
That woman of yours got a better shape
on her than Gooper's got on his.

647
00:46:04,096 --> 00:46:06,096
Is that the only difference
you've noticed, Big Daddy?

648
00:46:06,265 --> 00:46:08,683
Difference in shape's
pretty important, boy.

649
00:46:08,851 --> 00:46:11,691
- But in a way, they're a lot alike.
- How's that?

650
00:46:11,854 --> 00:46:14,614
They don't look peaceful. How's that?

651
00:46:15,149 --> 00:46:16,939
They're a couple of cats.

652
00:46:17,109 --> 00:46:20,359
They're sitting on the middle of a big
piece of land, you know, 28,000 acres.

653
00:46:20,529 --> 00:46:21,859
That's a lot of land.

654
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:23,780
And they're both squaring off,

655
00:46:23,949 --> 00:46:27,329
each determined to knock off
a bigger piece whenever you let go.

656
00:46:27,494 --> 00:46:30,214
Yeah. Well, I got a surprise
for them babies.

657
00:46:30,372 --> 00:46:33,882
I ain't gonna let go for a long time yet,
if that's what they're waiting for.

658
00:46:34,042 --> 00:46:35,882
That's right, Big Daddy,
you just set tight

659
00:46:36,044 --> 00:46:37,714
and let them scratch
each other's eyes out.

660
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:39,630
You bet your life.

661
00:46:40,048 --> 00:46:43,968
That Gooper's wife, she's a good breeder.
You'll have to admit she's fertile.

662
00:46:44,136 --> 00:46:45,966
Five head of them already and more coming.

663
00:46:46,138 --> 00:46:47,718
Yep, number six coming.

664
00:46:47,890 --> 00:46:51,390
Six nothing,
she'll probably drop a litter next time.

665
00:46:53,061 --> 00:46:54,731
Are you stuck out there or something?

666
00:46:54,897 --> 00:46:58,317
- Daddy, I was just passing by.
- You was just sneaking and spying.

667
00:46:58,484 --> 00:47:02,204
Do I have to lock all the doors around
here to have a private conversation?

668
00:47:02,362 --> 00:47:04,782
Big Daddy, why do you want to hurt
those that really love you?

669
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:05,990
Bull!

670
00:47:06,158 --> 00:47:08,578
I'm gonna move you and Gooper
out of that room.

671
00:47:08,744 --> 00:47:12,214
It's none of your business what goes on
in here between Brick and Maggie.

672
00:47:12,372 --> 00:47:15,212
I hate sneaking and spying.
It makes me puke!

673
00:47:20,088 --> 00:47:23,378
- They listen, do they?
- Yeah, they listen.

674
00:47:23,926 --> 00:47:26,756
They run and tell Big Momma
everything they hear.

675
00:47:26,929 --> 00:47:29,519
They say Maggie sleeps on the bed
and you sleep on the sofa.

676
00:47:29,681 --> 00:47:31,431
Is that true or not?

677
00:47:31,767 --> 00:47:34,057
If you don't like Maggie, get rid of her.

678
00:47:34,228 --> 00:47:36,768
- What're you doing over there now?
- Freshening up my drink.

679
00:47:36,939 --> 00:47:39,609
- You know you got a real liquor problem?
- Yes, sir, I know.

680
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:42,435
Is that why you quit your job,
sports-announcing, because of liquor?

681
00:47:42,611 --> 00:47:43,781
I guess so. Yes, sir, that's it.

682
00:47:43,946 --> 00:47:46,993
Don't guess about it, son.
It's too important.

683
00:47:47,574 --> 00:47:49,034
So, you quit?

684
00:47:49,952 --> 00:47:52,622
- Was that some kind of a disappointment?
- I don't know. Do you?

685
00:47:52,788 --> 00:47:56,008
I'm asking you.
How should I know if you don't?

686
00:48:00,295 --> 00:48:04,465
Son, do you think a shot of that whiskey
would injure my spastic condition?

687
00:48:06,093 --> 00:48:07,393
No, sir.

688
00:48:08,595 --> 00:48:11,175
It might do it some good.

689
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:22,110
- The sky is open again, boy. It's open.
- That's the way to feel.

690
00:48:27,347 --> 00:48:29,637
I can breathe.

691
00:48:30,659 --> 00:48:33,329
All my life, I've been
like a doubled-up fist,

692
00:48:33,495 --> 00:48:36,075
pounding and smashing and driving.

693
00:48:36,999 --> 00:48:40,289
But now I'm going
to take things easy with them.

694
00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:44,840
- You know what I'm contemplating?
- What's that, sir?

695
00:48:45,007 --> 00:48:46,167
Pleasure.

696
00:48:48,427 --> 00:48:52,257
I'll tell you something, boy, I still have
a feeling for women, and I'm 65.

697
00:48:52,431 --> 00:48:55,231
- That's mighty remarkable, Big Daddy.
- Remarkable?

698
00:48:55,483 --> 00:48:56,483
Admirable.

699
00:48:56,643 --> 00:49:00,863
It's not only remarkable and admirable,
it's downright satisfying.

700
00:49:01,023 --> 00:49:03,983
- I'm going to have me a ball.
- A ball, huh?

701
00:49:04,443 --> 00:49:06,283
I'm gonna pick me a choice woman,

702
00:49:06,445 --> 00:49:10,195
and I'm going to smother her in minks
and choke her with diamonds.

703
00:49:10,365 --> 00:49:12,155
I'm going to be happy.

704
00:49:14,536 --> 00:49:17,326
Why are you so restless?
You got ants in your britches?

705
00:49:17,497 --> 00:49:19,037
- Yes, sir.
- Why?

706
00:49:20,959 --> 00:49:23,499
- Something hasn't happened yet.
- What's that?

707
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:26,130
- A click in my head.
- Did you say, "click"?

708
00:49:26,298 --> 00:49:30,138
Yes, sir. The click in my head
that makes me feel peaceful.

709
00:49:30,385 --> 00:49:32,635
Boy, sometimes you worry me.

710
00:49:34,222 --> 00:49:36,642
It's like a switch,
clicking off in my head.

711
00:49:36,808 --> 00:49:41,228
Turns the hot light off and the cool one
on, and all of a sudden, there's peace.

712
00:49:43,231 --> 00:49:45,321
You're a real alcoholic.

713
00:49:46,735 --> 00:49:48,065
That is the truth.

714
00:49:48,236 --> 00:49:52,406
Yes, sir, I am an alcoholic.
So, if you'll just excuse me.

715
00:49:52,824 --> 00:49:54,874
- No, I won't excuse you!
- I'm waiting for that click!

716
00:49:55,035 --> 00:49:56,405
I don't get it unless I'm all alone,

717
00:49:56,578 --> 00:49:58,908
I'm talking to no one,
when there's absolute quiet!

718
00:49:59,081 --> 00:50:01,331
You'll hear plenty of that in the grave
soon enough.

719
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,880
But right now we're going to sit down
and talk this over.

720
00:50:04,044 --> 00:50:07,844
This talk is like all the others.
It gets nowhere and it's painful!

721
00:50:08,048 --> 00:50:09,878
All right, let it be painful.

722
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:12,720
I can crawl on one foot
and I can hop if I have to.

723
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:17,020
If you're not careful, you're gonna
crawl right out of this family,

724
00:50:17,349 --> 00:50:19,429
and have to hustle your drinks
on skid row.

725
00:50:19,601 --> 00:50:21,271
Yeah, that will come, too.

726
00:50:21,436 --> 00:50:22,936
No, it won't.

727
00:50:23,105 --> 00:50:25,895
Now that I'm straightened out,
I'm gonna straighten you out.

728
00:50:26,066 --> 00:50:27,106
Sit down!

729
00:50:27,275 --> 00:50:31,775
It's no use. We talk in circles.
We have nothing to say to each other!

730
00:50:38,578 --> 00:50:41,118
- Where are you going?
- To get me another bottle.

731
00:50:41,289 --> 00:50:43,459
No, you're not, you drunken whelp.

732
00:50:45,127 --> 00:50:48,297
What're you all shouting like that for?
I just can't stand it!

733
00:50:48,463 --> 00:50:50,133
Get out of here! Leave us alone!

734
00:50:50,298 --> 00:50:52,428
Why do you drink? Go on.

735
00:50:54,219 --> 00:50:56,969
You better know why you drink,
or give up drinking.

736
00:50:57,139 --> 00:50:59,389
- Give me my crutch.
- Why do you drink?

737
00:50:59,558 --> 00:51:01,978
Now, look, I stepped on that foot
and I'm in pain.

738
00:51:02,144 --> 00:51:03,984
Good!

739
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:15,235
At least you're not too numb
with liquor to feel pain.

740
00:51:16,783 --> 00:51:18,913
- Now, why do you drink?
- Give me my crutch.

741
00:51:19,077 --> 00:51:20,197
Tell me first.

742
00:51:20,454 --> 00:51:22,254
No, give me a drink first
and I'll tell you.

743
00:51:22,414 --> 00:51:23,964
Tell me first.

744
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,840
- First you got to tell me!
- All right! Disgust!

745
00:51:28,003 --> 00:51:31,173
- Disgust with what?
- You strike a hard bargain.

746
00:51:31,423 --> 00:51:35,783
- Boy, do you want liquor that bad?
- Yes, sir, I want liquor that bad.

747
00:51:40,015 --> 00:51:42,925
Now tell me what are you disgusted with?

748
00:51:43,185 --> 00:51:46,435
Mendacity. You know what that is?
It's lies and liars.

749
00:51:46,605 --> 00:51:49,019
Who's been lying to you? Maggie?
Your wife's been lying to you?

750
00:51:49,191 --> 00:51:51,191
No. Not one lie, not one person.
The whole thing.

751
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:53,609
- What's the matter? You got a headache?
- No, I'm just trying...

752
00:51:53,779 --> 00:51:55,699
You're just trying to concentrate,
but you can't.

753
00:51:55,864 --> 00:51:58,994
'Cause your brain is soaked with liquor.
Wet brain!

754
00:52:00,202 --> 00:52:01,452
Mendacity!

755
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:05,540
What do you know about mendacity?
I could write a book on it.

756
00:52:05,707 --> 00:52:08,537
- It's your sister calling from Memphis.
- To hell with her!

757
00:52:08,710 --> 00:52:10,840
Gooper, get out of there.

758
00:52:11,046 --> 00:52:13,466
Go on. Close the door after you.

759
00:52:13,965 --> 00:52:15,295
Mendacity!

760
00:52:15,467 --> 00:52:19,887
Look at all the lies that I got to
put up with. Pretenses, hypocrisy.

761
00:52:20,388 --> 00:52:21,888
Pretending like I care for Big Momma.

762
00:52:22,057 --> 00:52:25,227
I haven't been able to stand that woman
in 40 years.

763
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:28,900
Church. It bores me. But I go.

764
00:52:29,564 --> 00:52:32,154
And all those swindling lodges,
social clubs,

765
00:52:32,317 --> 00:52:34,027
and money-grabbing auxiliaries

766
00:52:34,194 --> 00:52:36,744
that's got me
on their number-one-sucker list.

767
00:52:36,905 --> 00:52:41,075
Boy, I've lived with mendacity.
Now why can't you live with it?

768
00:52:41,326 --> 00:52:45,326
You've got to live with it. There's
nothing to live with but mendacity.

769
00:52:45,497 --> 00:52:46,827
Is there?

770
00:52:47,290 --> 00:52:49,460
Oh, yes, sir, you can live with this.

771
00:52:52,587 --> 00:52:54,337
That's not living.

772
00:52:55,131 --> 00:52:58,181
- That's a-dodging away from life.
- I want to dodge away from it.

773
00:52:58,343 --> 00:53:00,973
- Then, son, why don't you kill yourself?
- Because I like to drink.

774
00:53:01,137 --> 00:53:04,427
- I can't talk to you.
- I'm sorry.

775
00:53:04,641 --> 00:53:07,811
You expect me to turn over
28,000 acres of the richest land

776
00:53:07,978 --> 00:53:09,858
this side of the Valley Nile
to a fool on a bottle?

777
00:53:10,063 --> 00:53:11,063
No, sir.

778
00:53:11,273 --> 00:53:15,069
I like you, son, but why should I subsidize
worthless behavior, rot, corruption?

779
00:53:15,235 --> 00:53:16,525
Turn it over to Gooper and Mae.

780
00:53:16,695 --> 00:53:20,655
I can't stand Gooper and Mae
and those five screaming monkeys.

781
00:53:21,867 --> 00:53:24,657
Now, I don't have to turn it over
to any of you.

782
00:53:24,828 --> 00:53:28,958
To this day, I ain't made no will.
Now I don't have to, the pressure's off.

783
00:53:29,291 --> 00:53:32,291
I can just wait and see if you
pull yourself together or if you don't.

784
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:33,670
That's right.

785
00:53:33,837 --> 00:53:36,967
- I'm not kidding.
- No, sir, I know you're not kidding.

786
00:53:37,799 --> 00:53:40,969
- You mean, you don't care?
- No, sir, I don't care.

787
00:53:42,304 --> 00:53:43,974
Will you tell Lacey
to drive me to the station?

788
00:53:44,139 --> 00:53:46,139
- Now wait a minute.
- Or I'll drive myself.

789
00:53:46,308 --> 00:53:48,308
I'm going home tonight. Now!

790
00:53:48,476 --> 00:53:51,226
- This is your home.
- Is it? Since when?

791
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,480
Let's don't leave it like this.

792
00:53:54,733 --> 00:53:57,363
Like all them other talks we've had.

793
00:53:57,611 --> 00:54:00,321
We always seem to talk around things.

794
00:54:01,323 --> 00:54:04,203
Seem to leave things unsaid and unspoken.

795
00:54:05,368 --> 00:54:08,958
- But now we've got to talk straight.
- No, sir, it's too late for talk.

796
00:54:09,122 --> 00:54:11,632
Why? What are you disgusted about?

797
00:54:12,709 --> 00:54:15,749
Because you can't play football anymore,
is that it?

798
00:54:15,921 --> 00:54:19,598
Because you lost your job,
sports-announcing? I'll get it back for you.

799
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:28,600
What? Sit in a glass box
watching games that I can't play?

800
00:54:29,225 --> 00:54:32,725
Describing what I can't do
while other players do it?

801
00:54:33,813 --> 00:54:36,323
Filling my Coke with bourbon
so I can stand it?

802
00:54:36,483 --> 00:54:38,983
Is that what you're gonna get back for me?

803
00:54:39,193 --> 00:54:41,913
I think you're passing the buck.

804
00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:45,410
You know many drinking men?

805
00:54:45,575 --> 00:54:47,485
I've known a goodly number
of that species.

806
00:54:47,661 --> 00:54:49,371
Could any of them tell you why they drank?

807
00:54:49,537 --> 00:54:51,457
You're passing the buck.

808
00:54:51,665 --> 00:54:55,245
You're passing the buck to things like
disgust and mendacity.

809
00:54:55,418 --> 00:54:57,998
If you've got to use
that kind of language about a thing,

810
00:54:58,171 --> 00:55:00,301
it's 90-proof bull and I ain't buying any!

811
00:55:00,548 --> 00:55:04,258
Oh, you started drinking
with your friend Skipper's death.

812
00:55:04,427 --> 00:55:06,927
Now that's the truth, ain't that?

813
00:55:15,355 --> 00:55:16,895
What are you suggesting?

814
00:55:18,108 --> 00:55:20,148
- Nothing. But...
- But what?

815
00:55:20,735 --> 00:55:23,605
Come on, say what's on your mind. Say it!

816
00:55:24,072 --> 00:55:26,202
- Why are you so excited?
- Go ahead, say it!

817
00:55:26,366 --> 00:55:27,656
What are you shouting like that for?

818
00:55:27,826 --> 00:55:29,946
Skipper and I were friends.
Can you understand that?

819
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:31,500
Gooper and Mae said that Skipper was...

820
00:55:31,663 --> 00:55:34,543
Skipper is the only thing
that I've got left to believe in!

821
00:55:34,708 --> 00:55:36,458
And you are dragging it
through the gutter!

822
00:55:36,626 --> 00:55:37,706
Now just a minute!

823
00:55:37,877 --> 00:55:40,167
You are making it
shameful and filthy, you...

824
00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:50,680
Give me your hand.

825
00:55:53,143 --> 00:55:56,903
I don't want your hand.
The hell with all lies and liars.

826
00:55:57,272 --> 00:56:01,902
Didn't you ever look up to anybody?
Anybody at all in your whole life?

827
00:56:02,110 --> 00:56:05,160
Didn't you ever believe
in anything, anybody?

828
00:56:06,281 --> 00:56:08,531
No, sir. I guess you didn't.

829
00:56:09,492 --> 00:56:12,662
Nothing and nobody
excepting Big Daddy himself.

830
00:56:12,954 --> 00:56:14,964
You and Skipper played football together.

831
00:56:15,123 --> 00:56:17,833
Made a few touchdowns.
Does that make him God Almighty?

832
00:56:18,001 --> 00:56:19,211
I could depend on him.

833
00:56:19,377 --> 00:56:21,457
- On the football field?
- Anytime, anywhere, anyplace.

834
00:56:21,629 --> 00:56:22,629
I could depend on him.

835
00:56:22,797 --> 00:56:24,297
- You sure of that?
- Yes, sir. Sure.

836
00:56:24,466 --> 00:56:25,626
Bull!

837
00:56:26,217 --> 00:56:29,007
Why did your big strong man fall apart?

838
00:56:30,055 --> 00:56:32,135
Why did Skipper crack up?

839
00:56:33,433 --> 00:56:34,813
All right.

840
00:56:35,727 --> 00:56:39,187
You're asking for it,
we're going to have that talk.

841
00:56:39,731 --> 00:56:41,781
That straight true talk.

842
00:56:42,317 --> 00:56:45,447
- It's too late to stop it now.
- Can you say it without a drink?

843
00:56:45,612 --> 00:56:48,322
But I haven't heard that click yet.
That mechanical click.

844
00:56:48,490 --> 00:56:52,120
You need a lot of crutches, don't you?
Clicks? Whiskey?

845
00:56:52,994 --> 00:56:55,664
What else you need? Skipper?

846
00:56:56,664 --> 00:56:59,674
- He was a crutch for you, too, wasn't he?
- Yes, sir.

847
00:56:59,834 --> 00:57:03,094
He was someone for me to lean on,
in school and out of it.

848
00:57:03,254 --> 00:57:06,674
How did Maggie take
this great and true friendship?

849
00:57:09,594 --> 00:57:10,684
Ask her.

850
00:57:10,845 --> 00:57:11,925
- I'm asking you.
- No.

851
00:57:12,097 --> 00:57:15,597
You want to know why Skipper
cracked up? Ask Maggie The Cat.

852
00:57:15,809 --> 00:57:17,229
What did she do?

853
00:57:17,393 --> 00:57:20,733
Chase him out of the 11th story window
of that Chicago hotel?

854
00:57:20,897 --> 00:57:24,647
Did that little, bitty girl shove
your big hero out all by herself?

855
00:57:25,151 --> 00:57:26,281
Why?

856
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:29,280
What was going on between
Skipper and Maggie?

857
00:57:30,532 --> 00:57:31,662
Ask her.

858
00:57:36,663 --> 00:57:40,543
- Maggie? In here.
- Can I be of assistance, Big Daddy?

859
00:57:44,754 --> 00:57:47,594
Trixie's ready to play the piano for you,
Big Daddy.

860
00:57:47,757 --> 00:57:50,225
Go ahead, Trixie, play.

861
00:57:58,017 --> 00:58:00,937
What was going on between you and Skipper?

862
00:58:03,064 --> 00:58:05,324
Well, you see, Big Daddy...

863
00:58:07,068 --> 00:58:08,238
Well?

864
00:58:09,529 --> 00:58:11,199
Oh, come on, Maggie.

865
00:58:11,531 --> 00:58:14,781
Now, you wanted to talk truth upstairs.
Go ahead.

866
00:58:15,577 --> 00:58:19,367
Come on, now, Big Daddy wants to know.
Go ahead, tell him.

867
00:58:23,585 --> 00:58:25,245
Skipper didn't like me.

868
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:27,630
Why, Maggie? Why didn't Skipper like you?

869
00:58:27,797 --> 00:58:29,507
You know he was against us
getting married.

870
00:58:29,674 --> 00:58:30,684
Why, Maggie?

871
00:58:30,842 --> 00:58:34,432
- Because it meant less freedom for you.
- Freedom to do what, Maggie?

872
00:58:34,596 --> 00:58:37,096
Freedom to run from town to town.

873
00:58:37,348 --> 00:58:39,518
Planes, trains, always running.

874
00:58:39,684 --> 00:58:44,114
- Football practice, dirty stories.
- Nobody forced you to come along with us.

875
00:58:44,272 --> 00:58:48,402
I didn't expect to spend my honeymoon
in the locker room with the boys.

876
00:58:48,568 --> 00:58:52,028
Since when did the smell of a man
ever injure your sensitive feelings?

877
00:58:52,197 --> 00:58:53,737
Football, baby.

878
00:58:53,907 --> 00:58:56,197
The idea of football smelled.

879
00:58:56,492 --> 00:58:59,452
Especially the notions
of a professional team.

880
00:58:59,621 --> 00:59:02,001
Why, he didn't need any team of his own.

881
00:59:02,165 --> 00:59:05,915
He could've gotten a spot
on any pro team in the country.

882
00:59:06,628 --> 00:59:09,088
You organized your own team
on account of Skipper.

883
00:59:09,255 --> 00:59:10,255
You're a liar!

884
00:59:10,423 --> 00:59:12,883
On account he wasn't good enough
to make it on his own.

885
00:59:13,051 --> 00:59:15,301
Professional football, Maggie,
is a business.

886
00:59:15,470 --> 00:59:17,060
Not a social club, a business.

887
00:59:17,347 --> 00:59:19,307
Oh, you mean the business of making money?

888
00:59:19,474 --> 00:59:22,444
Yeah, money!
The stuff that your dreams are made of.

889
00:59:22,685 --> 00:59:25,475
Why, the Dixie Stars never made a nickel.

890
00:59:25,647 --> 00:59:27,937
Not from the first day to the last.

891
00:59:28,107 --> 00:59:30,437
It wasn't the money, it was the cheers.

892
00:59:30,610 --> 00:59:31,950
He lapped them up.

893
00:59:32,111 --> 00:59:33,781
Oh, the cheers didn't mean anything to me.

894
00:59:33,947 --> 00:59:35,947
But they meant something to you,
didn't they?

895
00:59:36,115 --> 00:59:38,905
Because they shut you out
and that's what you hated, being shut out.

896
00:59:39,077 --> 00:59:41,497
Not by the crowds, baby, by you.

897
00:59:41,663 --> 00:59:45,963
By the man I worshiped.
That's why I hated Skipper.

898
00:59:46,793 --> 00:59:51,263
You hated him so much, that you
got him drunk and went to bed with him.

899
01:00:01,391 --> 01:00:03,181
Well, is that true?

900
01:00:08,514 --> 01:00:10,724
Oh, Big Daddy,

901
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:14,200
you don't think
I ravished a football hero?

902
01:00:18,199 --> 01:00:21,949
- Skipper was drunk.
- So are you most of the time.

903
01:00:22,370 --> 01:00:25,120
I don't seem to make out so well with you.

904
01:00:29,043 --> 01:00:32,173
Are you trying to say that nothing
happened between you and Skipper?

905
01:00:32,338 --> 01:00:34,378
- You know what happened.
- I don't know what happened!

906
01:00:34,549 --> 01:00:37,219
I don't know, Maggie. I wasn't there.

907
01:00:37,385 --> 01:00:40,135
I couldn't play that Sunday.
I wasn't in Chicago.

908
01:00:40,305 --> 01:00:42,385
- I was in the hospital.
- But Skipper played.

909
01:00:42,557 --> 01:00:44,227
Oh, he played, all right.

910
01:00:44,392 --> 01:00:47,852
He played his first professional game
without Brick.

911
01:00:48,646 --> 01:00:52,316
Tell Big Daddy what happened.
Go on, go ahead, tell him.

912
01:00:52,734 --> 01:00:54,694
You're a sports announcer.

913
01:00:54,861 --> 01:00:58,821
Give us a running account
of the all-American bust.

914
01:00:59,407 --> 01:01:04,745
Tell Big Daddy how many times Skipper
fumbled, and stumbled and fell apart.

915
01:01:05,413 --> 01:01:09,213
On offensive he was useless.
On defensive he was a coward.

916
01:01:09,542 --> 01:01:11,092
And it was all over.

917
01:01:11,252 --> 01:01:14,212
Chicago 47, Dixie Stars 0.

918
01:01:14,380 --> 01:01:16,170
- Bad breaks. An off day.
- No.

919
01:01:16,341 --> 01:01:17,591
No, baby.

920
01:01:17,759 --> 01:01:20,259
Without you, Skipper was nothing.

921
01:01:20,762 --> 01:01:22,932
Outside, big, tough, confident.

922
01:01:23,097 --> 01:01:24,927
Inside, pure jelly.

923
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:28,600
You saw the game on TV.
You saw what happened.

924
01:01:28,770 --> 01:01:31,190
But I didn't see what happened
in Skipper's hotel room.

925
01:01:31,356 --> 01:01:33,436
That little episode was not on TV.

926
01:01:33,691 --> 01:01:36,901
Go ahead, tell Big Daddy
why you were in Skipper's room.

927
01:01:37,111 --> 01:01:40,281
He was sick. Sick with drink.

928
01:01:40,448 --> 01:01:43,238
He wouldn't come out.
He'd busted some furniture,

929
01:01:43,409 --> 01:01:47,209
and the hotel manager said
to stop him before he called the police.

930
01:01:47,455 --> 01:01:49,365
So, I went to his room.

931
01:01:50,041 --> 01:01:52,791
I scratched on his door
and begged him to let me in.

932
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:54,380
He was half crazy.

933
01:01:54,545 --> 01:01:58,625
Violent and screaming one minute,
and weak and crying the next.

934
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:01,640
And all the time scared stiff about you.

935
01:02:03,304 --> 01:02:07,314
So, I said to him, maybe it was time
we forgot about football,

936
01:02:07,642 --> 01:02:11,272
maybe he ought to get a job
and let me and Brick alone.

937
01:02:12,271 --> 01:02:14,151
I thought he'd hit me.

938
01:02:15,817 --> 01:02:17,777
He walked toward me

939
01:02:18,152 --> 01:02:21,742
with a funny sort of smile on his face.

940
01:02:23,574 --> 01:02:27,504
Then he did the strangest thing.
He kissed me.

941
01:02:28,746 --> 01:02:31,666
That was the first time
he'd ever touched me.

942
01:02:31,833 --> 01:02:34,173
And then I knew what I was going to do.

943
01:02:34,335 --> 01:02:36,165
I'd get rid of Skipper.

944
01:02:36,337 --> 01:02:40,337
I'd show Brick that their deep,
true friendship was a big lie.

945
01:02:40,925 --> 01:02:42,335
I'd prove it by showing

946
01:02:42,510 --> 01:02:46,140
that Skipper would make love
to the wife of his best friend.

947
01:02:46,848 --> 01:02:50,348
He didn't need any coaxing.
He was more than willing.

948
01:02:50,852 --> 01:02:53,602
He even seemed to have the same idea.

949
01:02:54,188 --> 01:02:57,358
- You're just trying to whitewash it.
- I'm not!

950
01:02:57,525 --> 01:02:59,485
I was trying to win back my husband.

951
01:02:59,652 --> 01:03:04,032
It didn't matter how.
I would've done anything. Even that.

952
01:03:06,033 --> 01:03:09,043
But at the last second, I got panicky.

953
01:03:10,705 --> 01:03:13,035
Supposing I lost you instead?

954
01:03:14,041 --> 01:03:17,001
Supposing you'd hate me
instead of Skipper?

955
01:03:18,212 --> 01:03:19,552
So, I ran.

956
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:22,220
Nothing happened!

957
01:03:22,383 --> 01:03:25,393
I've tried to tell him 100 times,
but he won't let me.

958
01:03:25,553 --> 01:03:29,523
- Nothing happened!
- Hallelujah, Saint Maggie.

959
01:03:31,392 --> 01:03:33,812
I wanted to get rid of Skipper.

960
01:03:34,854 --> 01:03:36,564
But not if it meant losing you.

961
01:03:36,731 --> 01:03:39,231
He blames me for Skipper's death.

962
01:03:40,026 --> 01:03:42,196
Maybe I got rid of Skipper.

963
01:03:45,573 --> 01:03:47,663
Skipper won out, anyway.

964
01:03:50,495 --> 01:03:52,865
I didn't get rid of him at all.

965
01:04:00,755 --> 01:04:03,085
Isn't it an awful joke, honey?

966
01:04:04,258 --> 01:04:06,088
I lost you, anyway.

967
01:04:08,888 --> 01:04:12,018
- You didn't talk to him again before he...
- No.

968
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:14,850
- But Brick did.
- How do you know they talked?

969
01:04:15,019 --> 01:04:16,729
- Skipper told me.
- When?

970
01:04:16,896 --> 01:04:19,516
When they put his poor broken body
in the ambulance.

971
01:04:19,690 --> 01:04:21,780
I rode with him to the hospital.

972
01:04:22,068 --> 01:04:26,448
The whole time, he kept on saying,
"Why did Brick hang up on me, why?"

973
01:04:27,615 --> 01:04:29,025
Why, Brick?

974
01:04:44,423 --> 01:04:45,973
Brick, where are you going?

975
01:04:46,133 --> 01:04:48,143
Home.

976
01:04:50,137 --> 01:04:51,717
You can't drive. You're drunk.

977
01:04:51,889 --> 01:04:54,599
Not yet, Big Daddy. Not yet.
Now give me that bottle.

978
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:01,320
What are you running away from?

979
01:05:05,152 --> 01:05:08,492
Why did you hang up on Skipper
when he called you?

980
01:05:11,993 --> 01:05:13,413
Answer me.

981
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:17,120
What did he say?
Was it about him and Maggie?

982
01:05:17,290 --> 01:05:19,630
- He said they'd made love.
- And you believed him?

983
01:05:19,792 --> 01:05:20,922
Yes.

984
01:05:21,586 --> 01:05:23,956
Then why haven't you thrown her out?

985
01:05:24,130 --> 01:05:27,090
Something's missing here.
Now, why did Skipper kill himself?

986
01:05:27,383 --> 01:05:29,343
Because somebody let him down.

987
01:05:36,642 --> 01:05:38,192
I let him down.

988
01:05:40,438 --> 01:05:42,688
When he called that night,

989
01:05:45,484 --> 01:05:48,204
I couldn't make much sense out of...

990
01:05:48,362 --> 01:05:51,162
But there was one thing that was sure.

991
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:55,040
Skipper was scared.

992
01:05:56,162 --> 01:05:57,372
Scared.

993
01:05:59,290 --> 01:06:03,040
About what happened that day on
the football field, that I'd blame him,

994
01:06:03,210 --> 01:06:06,050
scared that I'd walk out on him.

995
01:06:08,049 --> 01:06:10,969
Skipper afraid, I couldn't believe that.

996
01:06:11,344 --> 01:06:14,894
I mean, inside, he was real,
deep-down scared.

997
01:06:15,806 --> 01:06:18,226
And he broke like a rotten stick.

998
01:06:19,810 --> 01:06:21,690
He started crying...

999
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:24,480
"I need you."

1000
01:06:25,066 --> 01:06:27,396
He kept babbling, "Help me."

1001
01:06:28,986 --> 01:06:30,396
Me help him?

1002
01:06:32,698 --> 01:06:36,658
How does one drowning man
help another drowning man?

1003
01:06:37,078 --> 01:06:38,998
So, you hung up on him.

1004
01:06:40,748 --> 01:06:42,668
And then that phone

1005
01:06:43,417 --> 01:06:45,337
started to ring again.

1006
01:06:47,171 --> 01:06:50,681
And it rang and it rang
and it wouldn't stop ringing.

1007
01:06:51,175 --> 01:06:52,925
And I lay in that hospital bed.

1008
01:06:53,177 --> 01:06:56,057
I was unable to move or run
from that sound and still,

1009
01:06:56,430 --> 01:06:59,020
it kept ringing louder and louder.

1010
01:06:59,266 --> 01:07:03,096
And the sound of that was like
Skipper screaming for help.

1011
01:07:07,441 --> 01:07:09,571
And I couldn't pick it up.

1012
01:07:11,445 --> 01:07:13,945
So, that's when he killed himself?

1013
01:07:18,285 --> 01:07:19,445
Yeah.

1014
01:07:21,455 --> 01:07:23,455
Because I let him down.

1015
01:07:28,295 --> 01:07:32,255
So, that disgust with mendacity
is really disgust with myself.

1016
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:34,430
And when I hear that click in my head,

1017
01:07:34,593 --> 01:07:37,393
I don't hear the sound
of that phone ringing anymore.

1018
01:07:37,555 --> 01:07:41,475
And I can stop thinking.
I'm ashamed, Big Daddy!

1019
01:07:41,642 --> 01:07:45,152
That's why I'm a drunk.
When I'm drunk, I can stand myself.

1020
01:07:45,563 --> 01:07:48,903
But it's always there in the morning,
ain't it? The truth?

1021
01:07:49,233 --> 01:07:50,993
And it's here right now.

1022
01:07:52,486 --> 01:07:56,156
You're just feeling sorry for yourself.
That's all it is, self-pity!

1023
01:07:56,323 --> 01:07:58,833
You didn't kill Skipper.
He killed himself.

1024
01:07:58,993 --> 01:08:02,333
You and Skipper and millions like you,
are living in a kids' world,

1025
01:08:02,496 --> 01:08:06,326
playing games, touchdowns,
no worries, no responsibilities.

1026
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:11,090
Life ain't no damn football game.
Life ain't just a bunch of high spots.

1027
01:08:12,256 --> 01:08:15,676
You're a 30-year-old kid.
Soon you'll be a 50-year-old kid

1028
01:08:15,968 --> 01:08:18,428
pretending you hearing cheers
when there ain't any.

1029
01:08:18,596 --> 01:08:21,016
Dreaming and drinking your life away.

1030
01:08:21,182 --> 01:08:26,145
Heroes in the real world live 24 hours
a day, not just two hours in a game.

1031
01:08:26,979 --> 01:08:29,019
Mendacity! You won't...

1032
01:08:32,777 --> 01:08:36,357
You won't live with mendacity,
but you're an expert at it.

1033
01:08:36,530 --> 01:08:38,700
The truth is pain and sweat,

1034
01:08:38,866 --> 01:08:42,996
paying bills and making love
to a woman that you don't love anymore.

1035
01:08:43,162 --> 01:08:45,372
The truth is dreams that don't come true,

1036
01:08:45,539 --> 01:08:48,669
and nobody prints your name
in the paper till you die.

1037
01:08:54,548 --> 01:08:55,878
Now, here.

1038
01:09:00,095 --> 01:09:02,005
The truth is you never growed up.

1039
01:09:02,181 --> 01:09:04,521
- Grownups don't hang up on friends.
- Get away from the car.

1040
01:09:04,683 --> 01:09:05,773
They don't hang up on their wives.

1041
01:09:05,935 --> 01:09:08,015
- They don't hang up on life.
- Would you just please let go?

1042
01:09:08,187 --> 01:09:10,727
Now that's the truth
and that's what you can't face.

1043
01:09:10,898 --> 01:09:12,398
- Can you face the truth?
- Try me.

1044
01:09:12,566 --> 01:09:14,106
Sure, somebody else's truth.

1045
01:09:14,276 --> 01:09:16,236
- Bull. You're running again.
- Yeah, I am running.

1046
01:09:16,403 --> 01:09:18,743
Running from lies.
Lies like birthday congratulations

1047
01:09:18,906 --> 01:09:23,076
and many happy returns of the day
when there won't be any and...

1048
01:09:34,213 --> 01:09:36,223
Please, let me go home.

1049
01:09:37,424 --> 01:09:39,094
- What did you say?
- I don't remember.

1050
01:09:39,260 --> 01:09:41,050
Many happy returns
when there won't be any?

1051
01:09:41,220 --> 01:09:42,390
Forget it.

1052
01:09:42,555 --> 01:09:45,385
Now, please, just let me go home.
Leave the place to Gooper and Mae.

1053
01:09:45,558 --> 01:09:48,768
Leave the place. Who said I was going
to leave the place or anything?

1054
01:09:48,936 --> 01:09:51,606
I'll outlive you. I'll bury you.

1055
01:09:51,772 --> 01:09:54,152
- I'll buy your coffin.
- That's right, Big Daddy,

1056
01:09:54,316 --> 01:09:56,106
many happy returns.

1057
01:10:01,949 --> 01:10:04,789
They were lying, weren't they, son?

1058
01:10:05,828 --> 01:10:08,408
About that report from the clinic?

1059
01:10:10,249 --> 01:10:12,919
This pain keeps grabbing me.

1060
01:10:14,670 --> 01:10:16,130
It's death.

1061
01:10:17,298 --> 01:10:18,628
Ain't it?

1062
01:10:19,466 --> 01:10:21,836
Answer me! The truth!

1063
01:10:23,971 --> 01:10:28,351
You said it yourself, Big Daddy.
Mendacity is a system we live in.

1064
01:11:01,967 --> 01:11:03,177
Brick.

1065
01:11:05,179 --> 01:11:06,639
Brick, wait!

1066
01:11:28,869 --> 01:11:31,209
Look at us, Maggie. Look at us.

1067
01:11:31,372 --> 01:11:35,582
The great Pollitt Enterprises
stuck in the...

1068
01:11:37,711 --> 01:11:39,551
I hurt him, Maggie.

1069
01:11:43,217 --> 01:11:45,507
I hurt him really bad.

1070
01:11:46,220 --> 01:11:48,060
What's the matter? What's happened?

1071
01:11:48,222 --> 01:11:50,682
- Why is Big Daddy...
- We got to talk to you, Big Momma.

1072
01:11:50,849 --> 01:11:53,229
- Mae, get Dr. Baugh!
- Where is he?

1073
01:11:53,394 --> 01:11:56,024
- I don't know, just find him.
- Brick.

1074
01:12:04,905 --> 01:12:09,405
- Doc. Doc!
- I wouldn't go down to him right now, Ida.

1075
01:12:10,452 --> 01:12:11,912
Sweetheart!

1076
01:12:12,913 --> 01:12:15,083
Big Daddy, can you hear me?

1077
01:12:15,541 --> 01:12:17,921
Sweetheart, what are you doing?

1078
01:12:18,419 --> 01:12:20,089
I'm coming down.

1079
01:12:23,257 --> 01:12:26,467
No need to, Ida.
We'll be coming up in a minute.

1080
01:12:34,852 --> 01:12:35,942
Oh...

1081
01:12:36,770 --> 01:12:38,770
If that pain gets too bad,

1082
01:12:39,773 --> 01:12:42,943
this is morphine and a syringe.

1083
01:12:44,278 --> 01:12:46,778
The instructions are written out.

1084
01:12:48,949 --> 01:12:51,289
It's no use pretending anymore.

1085
01:12:51,493 --> 01:12:54,123
When that pain hits, it'll hit hard.

1086
01:12:55,247 --> 01:12:57,287
Make it easy on yourself.

1087
01:12:59,835 --> 01:13:00,995
Here.

1088
01:13:01,628 --> 01:13:04,298
You better take off those wet clothes.

1089
01:13:05,466 --> 01:13:08,426
Why? You afraid
I might catch cold and die?

1090
01:13:25,819 --> 01:13:28,819
- Why can't I go down to him?
- Well, he's, uh...

1091
01:13:31,158 --> 01:13:33,488
Well, his stomach's upset, Ida.

1092
01:13:35,662 --> 01:13:38,002
Well, all he needs is a peppermint.

1093
01:13:39,166 --> 01:13:40,996
It's time we had that little talk, Doc.

1094
01:13:41,168 --> 01:13:43,998
- It's gonna be painful.
- Painful things can't always be avoided.

1095
01:13:44,171 --> 01:13:46,051
So I've noticed,
but there are times when you...

1096
01:13:46,215 --> 01:13:48,675
Yes, sir, I think it's time
we all had our little talk.

1097
01:13:48,842 --> 01:13:51,142
What talk are you all talking about?

1098
01:13:51,303 --> 01:13:53,683
Doc, what were Brick and Big Daddy
fighting about out in the rain?

1099
01:13:53,931 --> 01:13:54,931
We didn't discuss it.

1100
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:57,180
What's he doing in the cellar all alone?

1101
01:13:57,351 --> 01:14:00,191
- Why can't Big Momma go and see him?
- You heard why.

1102
01:14:00,354 --> 01:14:03,734
'Cause he's got the stomach upset.
It's made him irritable.

1103
01:14:03,982 --> 01:14:07,072
When old couples been together
as long as me and Big Daddy,

1104
01:14:07,236 --> 01:14:11,906
they get irritable with each other
from too much devotion.

1105
01:14:12,866 --> 01:14:14,406
Isn't that so?

1106
01:14:15,702 --> 01:14:17,542
Of course that's so.

1107
01:14:18,705 --> 01:14:20,495
He loves his family.

1108
01:14:20,707 --> 01:14:23,377
He loves to have them around him,
but it's a strain on his nerves.

1109
01:14:23,544 --> 01:14:26,214
He wasn't himself.
I could tell he was all worked up.

1110
01:14:26,380 --> 01:14:29,220
It's the party and the excitement and all.

1111
01:14:29,383 --> 01:14:31,893
He's probably just
a little wore out, that's all.

1112
01:14:32,052 --> 01:14:35,682
Did you notice how he ate?
He ate like a P-I-G hog.

1113
01:14:36,390 --> 01:14:38,520
I hope he don't regret it.

1114
01:14:38,767 --> 01:14:42,057
Who? Big Daddy?

1115
01:14:42,354 --> 01:14:44,904
Why, he helped himself twice
to Hopping John.

1116
01:14:45,065 --> 01:14:48,395
He just loves Hopping John.
We had a real country dinner.

1117
01:14:48,569 --> 01:14:49,739
And candied yams.

1118
01:14:49,903 --> 01:14:53,123
That man put away enough
to stuff a field hand.

1119
01:14:54,116 --> 01:14:56,536
I just hope he don't have
to pay for it later on.

1120
01:14:56,702 --> 01:14:57,872
What? What's that?

1121
01:14:58,036 --> 01:14:59,576
Gooper say he hopes Big Daddy...

1122
01:14:59,746 --> 01:15:02,036
Oh, shoot. Gooper says. Gooper says.

1123
01:15:02,207 --> 01:15:05,247
There ain't nothing wrong
with Big Daddy but nerves.

1124
01:15:06,753 --> 01:15:08,013
Ain't that so, Maggie?

1125
01:15:11,425 --> 01:15:13,965
He's as sound as a dollar.
And now he knows he is.

1126
01:15:14,136 --> 01:15:18,556
And that's why he ate such a supper.
He had a load off his mind, knowing

1127
01:15:18,724 --> 01:15:24,650
he wasn't doomed
to what he thought he was doomed to.

1128
01:15:26,940 --> 01:15:29,110
Now, nothing's going to hurt Big Daddy.

1129
01:15:29,276 --> 01:15:31,896
We just won't allow
anything to happen to him.

1130
01:15:32,070 --> 01:15:34,110
Doc. Come here, Doc!

1131
01:15:34,281 --> 01:15:35,411
I don't need any doctor.

1132
01:15:35,574 --> 01:15:37,414
He's got something to tell you
about Big Daddy.

1133
01:15:37,576 --> 01:15:39,616
I want Brick.

1134
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:42,120
He'll be down directly.

1135
01:15:42,414 --> 01:15:44,924
Sticky rain always makes me sick.

1136
01:15:45,667 --> 01:15:48,457
Give me something
to wash this tablet down with.

1137
01:15:48,629 --> 01:15:51,969
What's wrong here?
You've all got such long faces.

1138
01:15:53,634 --> 01:15:57,474
- Brick, Big Momma needs you.
- They'll tell her without me.

1139
01:15:57,804 --> 01:15:59,314
Oh, please, Brick.

1140
01:15:59,473 --> 01:16:02,313
I just can't stand the way
that Mae and Gooper are...

1141
01:16:02,476 --> 01:16:05,016
Are what? Trying to
grab off this place for themselves?

1142
01:16:05,187 --> 01:16:07,147
Well, let them have it all.

1143
01:16:07,314 --> 01:16:09,864
And if you want to fight
for a piece of the old man's carcass,

1144
01:16:10,025 --> 01:16:12,315
why, you go right ahead,
but you're gonna do it without me.

1145
01:16:12,486 --> 01:16:16,696
All right, I deserve that.
But not this time. This time you're wrong.

1146
01:16:16,865 --> 01:16:21,495
What I can't stand
is not losing this place. It's Big Momma.

1147
01:16:22,496 --> 01:16:25,496
I know what it's like
to lose somebody you love.

1148
01:16:25,666 --> 01:16:28,496
Careful, Maggie, your claws are showing.

1149
01:16:31,630 --> 01:16:34,680
- Mae, close that door.
- Don't close that door.

1150
01:16:35,717 --> 01:16:37,297
Let a little air circulate.

1151
01:16:37,469 --> 01:16:39,179
I just don't think
we ought to run the risk

1152
01:16:39,346 --> 01:16:41,516
of Big Daddy hearing a word
of this discussion.

1153
01:16:41,682 --> 01:16:43,392
What discussion of what?

1154
01:16:43,558 --> 01:16:45,308
- Maggie, Brick...
- Now, now, Big Momma...

1155
01:16:45,477 --> 01:16:48,477
There ain't gonna be a word said
in this house of Big Daddy Pollitt's,

1156
01:16:48,647 --> 01:16:51,227
that he can't hear if he wants to.
Brick, where are you?

1157
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:54,240
Where do you think he is?
Gone to pieces, that's where.

1158
01:16:54,403 --> 01:16:56,533
Doc, ain't there some kind of cure
for drinkers?

1159
01:16:56,697 --> 01:16:58,527
- Brick don't need no cures.
- Of course he don't.

1160
01:16:58,907 --> 01:17:01,697
Give him time. He'll lap up all the
whiskey in the state. That'll cure him.

1161
01:17:01,868 --> 01:17:03,078
Stop that kind of talk.

1162
01:17:04,037 --> 01:17:07,747
Big Daddy takes a drink now and then.
I don't trust a man who don't drink.

1163
01:17:07,916 --> 01:17:09,206
Good for you.

1164
01:17:09,376 --> 01:17:12,746
Mae, sit down,
hold Big Momma's hand while we talk.

1165
01:17:14,423 --> 01:17:18,263
What are you all surrounding me for?
I don't need you to hold my hand.

1166
01:17:18,427 --> 01:17:20,967
- You all crazy?
- You calm yourself, sweetheart.

1167
01:17:21,138 --> 01:17:23,098
You calm yourself yourself, Sister Woman!

1168
01:17:23,265 --> 01:17:25,885
How am I going to calm myself
with everyone staring at me as if

1169
01:17:26,059 --> 01:17:27,809
big drops of blood
had broken out on my face?

1170
01:17:29,730 --> 01:17:31,900
What's all this about, huh? What?

1171
01:17:32,065 --> 01:17:33,475
Doc. Sit down, Mae.

1172
01:17:33,650 --> 01:17:37,069
Big Momma wants to know the complete truth
about the report we got from the clinic.

1173
01:17:37,237 --> 01:17:39,067
Truth!

1174
01:17:39,406 --> 01:17:42,116
Everybody keeps hollering about the truth.

1175
01:17:42,284 --> 01:17:44,914
Well, the truth is as dirty as lies!

1176
01:17:54,087 --> 01:17:56,797
- Is there something I don't know, Doc?
- Well, Ida...

1177
01:17:56,965 --> 01:17:58,585
I want to know!

1178
01:18:02,179 --> 01:18:05,639
- Somebody must be lying.
- Come and sit down, Momma, please.

1179
01:18:05,807 --> 01:18:07,807
I want to know about my husband.

1180
01:18:07,976 --> 01:18:11,686
He had the most thorough examination
ever given at the Ofenheim Clinic.

1181
01:18:11,855 --> 01:18:13,935
It's one of the best clinics
in the country.

1182
01:18:14,107 --> 01:18:16,487
It's the best in the country, bar none.

1183
01:18:16,651 --> 01:18:19,491
They were 99.9% sure
before they even started.

1184
01:18:19,654 --> 01:18:20,864
Right, Doc?

1185
01:18:21,114 --> 01:18:22,124
Sure of what?

1186
01:18:22,282 --> 01:18:23,952
- Not now.
- The test was positive!

1187
01:18:24,117 --> 01:18:25,617
Mae, shut up.

1188
01:18:31,458 --> 01:18:34,168
It's hopeless, Ida. He knows it, too.

1189
01:18:35,462 --> 01:18:37,212
Hopeless?

1190
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:40,010
- Now, now, darling.
- You had to know.

1191
01:18:40,801 --> 01:18:43,301
Why didn't they cut it out of him, huh?

1192
01:18:44,221 --> 01:18:47,811
- It's gone past the knife, Ida.
- He's dying, Big Momma.

1193
01:18:47,974 --> 01:18:50,394
You get away from me, Mae.
Get away from me.

1194
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:54,020
I want Brick. Where's my Brick?
Where's my only son?

1195
01:18:56,233 --> 01:18:59,223
- Brick!
- Momma, please.

1196
01:19:00,862 --> 01:19:03,162
- I'm your son, too.
- Gooper's your firstborn.

1197
01:19:03,323 --> 01:19:04,833
- Now, listen to me!
- No!

1198
01:19:04,991 --> 01:19:07,371
- Ida, he'll be having some pain.
- Gooper and I think...

1199
01:19:07,536 --> 01:19:08,996
Oh, Mae, shut up.

1200
01:19:09,162 --> 01:19:11,042
- You want to see him suffer?
- No.

1201
01:19:11,206 --> 01:19:13,666
- Then he's got to be started on morphine.
- No.

1202
01:19:13,834 --> 01:19:17,554
Nobody's going to give
my husband morphine. No.

1203
01:19:18,547 --> 01:19:20,757
No.

1204
01:19:23,885 --> 01:19:26,345
Why don't you give her a while
to adjust herself to the idea?

1205
01:19:26,513 --> 01:19:28,433
- It's Maggie's who's upsetting her.
- Hey, Doc,

1206
01:19:28,598 --> 01:19:32,688
instead of a needle, haven't you maybe got
a pill to make the pain disappear?

1207
01:19:32,853 --> 01:19:36,363
Sometimes I wish I had a pill
to make people disappear.

1208
01:19:36,523 --> 01:19:39,533
Thanks for everything, Doc,
we sure do appreciate...

1209
01:19:56,251 --> 01:19:57,541
Does Brick know?

1210
01:20:11,475 --> 01:20:13,225
You know, honey,

1211
01:20:15,562 --> 01:20:18,062
we was never a very happy family.

1212
01:20:20,567 --> 01:20:22,937
I mean, there wasn't much joy
in this house.

1213
01:20:23,111 --> 01:20:26,571
It wasn't Big Daddy's fault.
I mean, it was just...

1214
01:20:26,907 --> 01:20:30,117
You know how some homes
are happy homes, but...

1215
01:20:31,661 --> 01:20:36,291
I thought coming home from the clinic
this morning, now we'll be happy here.

1216
01:20:36,458 --> 01:20:38,168
You and Brick will come and live with us,

1217
01:20:38,335 --> 01:20:40,245
and you'll have your children
in this house,

1218
01:20:40,420 --> 01:20:42,960
and we'll help each other be happy.

1219
01:20:47,844 --> 01:20:50,644
Nothing's ever the way you plan, is it?

1220
01:20:56,770 --> 01:20:59,440
Margaret, honey, you got to help Brick.

1221
01:20:59,606 --> 01:21:02,976
Make him pull himself together. You see,
if he's gonna take hold of things...

1222
01:21:03,151 --> 01:21:04,951
Take hold of what things?

1223
01:21:06,947 --> 01:21:08,277
The place.

1224
01:21:08,448 --> 01:21:11,538
- Big Momma, you've had a shock.
- Yes, we've all had a shock.

1225
01:21:11,701 --> 01:21:14,331
- Let's be realistic.
- Big Daddy would never be foolish enough.

1226
01:21:14,496 --> 01:21:17,496
He'd never be foolish enough
to put this place in irresponsible hands!

1227
01:21:17,666 --> 01:21:20,786
He ain't putting this place
in anybody's hands.

1228
01:21:20,961 --> 01:21:23,211
My husband is not going to die!

1229
01:21:23,380 --> 01:21:25,550
Now, I want you to get that in your heads.
Both of you.

1230
01:21:25,715 --> 01:21:28,295
- We're hoping just as much as you are.
- We intend to pray for him.

1231
01:21:28,468 --> 01:21:31,008
But I'm not gonna let you
persuade Big Daddy to leave this place...

1232
01:21:31,179 --> 01:21:32,889
Gooper is your firstborn!

1233
01:21:33,056 --> 01:21:37,136
He always had to carry a bigger load
of the responsibilities than Brick.

1234
01:21:37,310 --> 01:21:41,150
Brick never carried a thing in his life,
but a football or a highball.

1235
01:21:41,314 --> 01:21:43,364
- Mae, will you let me talk? Please?
- Yes, of course.

1236
01:21:43,525 --> 01:21:44,815
All right.

1237
01:21:45,694 --> 01:21:48,664
A 28,000 acre plantation
is a mighty big thing to run.

1238
01:21:48,822 --> 01:21:50,072
Almost single-handed.

1239
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:53,830
You had your law practice in Memphis.
When did you ever run this place?

1240
01:21:53,994 --> 01:21:56,164
Oh, Momma, let's be fair.

1241
01:21:56,454 --> 01:21:59,674
Ever since Big Daddy's health
started failing him,

1242
01:21:59,833 --> 01:22:02,673
Gooper has worked like a fool
to keep this place up.

1243
01:22:02,836 --> 01:22:05,416
Gooper won't admit it.
He never thought of it as a duty.

1244
01:22:05,589 --> 01:22:06,589
Mae!

1245
01:22:06,756 --> 01:22:08,506
Big Daddy don't even know
half of what he owns.

1246
01:22:08,675 --> 01:22:11,045
The point is, I'm not gonna see
this place run into the ground

1247
01:22:11,219 --> 01:22:12,889
by a drunken ex-football hero.

1248
01:22:13,054 --> 01:22:15,854
- You shut up about my husband!
- You shut up!

1249
01:22:16,016 --> 01:22:17,676
He has no right to slander...

1250
01:22:17,851 --> 01:22:21,191
I got the right to discuss my own brother
with members of my own family,

1251
01:22:21,354 --> 01:22:23,404
which don't include you.

1252
01:22:24,065 --> 01:22:27,025
Now, why don't you go up there
and drink with Brick.

1253
01:22:27,193 --> 01:22:29,743
If the conquering hero
hasn't passed out already.

1254
01:22:29,904 --> 01:22:32,534
He may have to pass up
the Sugar Bowl this year.

1255
01:22:32,699 --> 01:22:34,739
Or was it the Rose Bowl
he made his famous run in?

1256
01:22:34,909 --> 01:22:36,539
It was the Punch Bowl, honey.

1257
01:22:36,703 --> 01:22:39,293
- The cut-glass punch bowl.
- That's right.

1258
01:22:39,456 --> 01:22:41,876
I always get that boy's bowls mixed up.

1259
01:22:42,042 --> 01:22:45,632
Oh, I have never seen
such malice toward a brother.

1260
01:22:45,962 --> 01:22:48,212
What about his malice toward Gooper?

1261
01:22:48,381 --> 01:22:51,381
He can't even stand being
in the same room with me.

1262
01:22:53,261 --> 01:22:56,011
- Can I help you, Mr. Brick?
- No, thank you, Lacey.

1263
01:22:56,598 --> 01:22:59,308
- Where's my father?
- He's in the cellar.

1264
01:22:59,476 --> 01:23:02,396
And he's alone. And he's...

1265
01:23:03,605 --> 01:23:05,315
Thank you, Lacey.

1266
01:23:05,732 --> 01:23:07,982
This is a deliberate campaign
to ruin Brick.

1267
01:23:08,151 --> 01:23:09,241
He doesn't need any help.

1268
01:23:09,402 --> 01:23:13,112
For the most disgusting
and sordid reasons on earth. Avarice.

1269
01:23:13,281 --> 01:23:15,701
Avarice and greed!

1270
01:23:15,992 --> 01:23:18,582
Oh, no, Margaret, darling, don't cry.
Don't cry.

1271
01:23:18,745 --> 01:23:21,075
- Well, that takes the cake.
- Mae.

1272
01:23:21,247 --> 01:23:23,167
Who are the tears for?

1273
01:23:23,750 --> 01:23:25,420
Brick? Big Daddy?

1274
01:23:25,585 --> 01:23:27,295
- Or are they for yourself?
- Mae.

1275
01:23:27,462 --> 01:23:31,132
Are you crying 'cause you're childless?
You know why she's got no kids?

1276
01:23:31,299 --> 01:23:34,259
- Ask her big, beautiful husband.
- Mae!

1277
01:23:35,470 --> 01:23:39,100
You just won't let me do this
the nice way, will you? All right.

1278
01:23:40,141 --> 01:23:44,101
You always said I never loved Big Daddy.
How would you know?

1279
01:23:45,522 --> 01:23:48,782
How would he know?
Did he ever let anybody love him?

1280
01:23:48,942 --> 01:23:50,692
For him it was always Brick, always.

1281
01:23:50,860 --> 01:23:54,280
From the day he was born,
he was always partial to Brick. Why?

1282
01:23:54,447 --> 01:23:57,277
Big Daddy wanted me
to become a lawyer. I became a lawyer.

1283
01:23:57,450 --> 01:23:58,950
He said, "Get married." I got married.

1284
01:23:59,119 --> 01:24:00,869
He said, "Have kids." I had kids.

1285
01:24:01,037 --> 01:24:03,117
He said, "Live in Memphis."
I lived in Memphis.

1286
01:24:03,289 --> 01:24:06,039
Whatever he said do, I did, all right.

1287
01:24:07,001 --> 01:24:09,801
I don't give a damn whether
Big Daddy likes me or don't like me,

1288
01:24:09,963 --> 01:24:13,383
or did or never did or will or will never.

1289
01:24:15,301 --> 01:24:18,811
I've appealed for common decency
and fair play.

1290
01:24:18,972 --> 01:24:20,812
Now I'm telling you.

1291
01:24:21,141 --> 01:24:23,181
I intend to protect my interests.

1292
01:24:23,351 --> 01:24:26,481
I'm not a corporation lawyer
for nothing. Mae.

1293
01:24:26,646 --> 01:24:29,646
- Go get my briefcase out of our bedroom.
- Yes, hon.

1294
01:24:33,361 --> 01:24:34,491
Oh...

1295
01:24:35,572 --> 01:24:37,322
It was... I...

1296
01:24:37,490 --> 01:24:40,160
It was the Cotton Bowl, Sister Woman.

1297
01:24:59,846 --> 01:25:00,886
Pa?

1298
01:25:27,582 --> 01:25:28,672
Pa?

1299
01:25:41,805 --> 01:25:44,805
- Give me your hand.
- I don't want your hand.

1300
01:26:38,278 --> 01:26:39,278
No.

1301
01:26:39,445 --> 01:26:41,155
- But the Doc told...
- It's my pain.

1302
01:26:41,322 --> 01:26:43,242
That makes it my business.

1303
01:26:43,408 --> 01:26:46,368
I thought you went and hid yourself.
What do you want?

1304
01:26:46,536 --> 01:26:49,536
- I came to apologize.
- Yeah?

1305
01:26:50,081 --> 01:26:51,751
What for, telling me the truth?

1306
01:26:51,916 --> 01:26:54,876
- There must be a dozen reasons.
- Save them.

1307
01:26:55,587 --> 01:26:58,257
I hate apologies.
Especially for the truth.

1308
01:26:58,423 --> 01:27:01,553
Whatever you did, don't apologize for it.
Just don't do it again.

1309
01:27:01,718 --> 01:27:03,848
If you didn't do it, start doing it.

1310
01:27:04,012 --> 01:27:05,892
Start by getting me
a cigar out of that coat.

1311
01:27:06,055 --> 01:27:09,055
- You think you ought...
- Get me the cigar, boy!

1312
01:27:14,522 --> 01:27:15,822
It's all wet from the rain.

1313
01:27:15,982 --> 01:27:19,782
You're all wet yourself.
It's a lousy joke, but it's true.

1314
01:27:24,006 --> 01:27:25,966
Modern science.

1315
01:27:38,296 --> 01:27:39,876
Get me that...

1316
01:27:44,344 --> 01:27:45,724
That robe.

1317
01:27:56,731 --> 01:28:00,191
- There's a bottle in that desk.
- I don't want a drink.

1318
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:03,030
Well, I do. I want a drink.

1319
01:28:04,155 --> 01:28:06,945
I've got a million "clicks" in my guts.

1320
01:28:08,284 --> 01:28:10,584
Knives sharpening themselves.

1321
01:28:13,748 --> 01:28:16,628
You know about "clicks," don't you, boy?

1322
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:21,420
So, you bought me a birthday present?

1323
01:28:22,757 --> 01:28:24,877
No, sir, Maggie bought it.

1324
01:28:26,386 --> 01:28:29,686
- Got good taste, that girl.
- In some things, yes, sir.

1325
01:28:29,905 --> 01:28:31,195
But not in men.

1326
01:28:34,394 --> 01:28:36,194
Nice soft material.

1327
01:28:36,354 --> 01:28:38,444
And this is my soft birthday.

1328
01:28:38,606 --> 01:28:42,026
Not my gold or my silver.
This is my soft birthday.

1329
01:28:47,198 --> 01:28:50,238
Here's to my last birthday.

1330
01:28:52,203 --> 01:28:54,463
Aren't you drinking to that?

1331
01:28:56,541 --> 01:28:58,131
Clickety-click.

1332
01:29:09,679 --> 01:29:12,639
You know what I'm going to do
before I die?

1333
01:29:13,224 --> 01:29:15,944
I'm going to open up all these boxes.

1334
01:29:17,729 --> 01:29:19,809
Will you look at this stuff?

1335
01:29:19,981 --> 01:29:23,901
Bought most of it when I took your mother
to Europe on that Cook's tour.

1336
01:29:24,068 --> 01:29:26,858
Never had such a lousy time in my life.

1337
01:29:27,238 --> 01:29:30,028
Now that Europe is nothing
but a great big auction.

1338
01:29:30,199 --> 01:29:32,539
Bunch of old worn-out places,
a great, big fire sale,

1339
01:29:32,702 --> 01:29:34,162
the whole rotten thing.

1340
01:29:34,328 --> 01:29:36,158
And Big Momma went wild in it.

1341
01:29:36,330 --> 01:29:38,750
Boy! She just bought and bought.

1342
01:29:40,001 --> 01:29:43,421
Sure is lucky I'm a rich man.
Yes, sirree, it sure is lucky.

1343
01:29:43,796 --> 01:29:46,966
Got any idea what I'm worth, son?
Ask Gooper. He knows.

1344
01:29:47,133 --> 01:29:50,223
He knows to the penny
unless I miss my guess.

1345
01:29:51,262 --> 01:29:54,722
Close on $10 million in cash
and blue-chip stocks,

1346
01:29:55,141 --> 01:30:00,059
besides 28,000 acres of the richest
land this side of the Valley Nile.

1347
01:30:00,229 --> 01:30:02,939
Well, that is pretty rich to be.

1348
01:30:05,234 --> 01:30:09,494
There's one thing you can't buy
in a Europe fire sale,

1349
01:30:10,573 --> 01:30:12,873
or any other market on earth.

1350
01:30:13,451 --> 01:30:15,161
That's your life.

1351
01:30:17,955 --> 01:30:20,785
Can't buy back your life
when it's finished.

1352
01:30:20,958 --> 01:30:23,208
No, sir, nobody can do that.

1353
01:30:24,545 --> 01:30:26,955
Feeling sorry for me or for you?

1354
01:30:30,551 --> 01:30:31,641
For you, Papa.

1355
01:30:31,803 --> 01:30:34,723
That's good.
Because you're going to miss me, boy.

1356
01:30:36,590 --> 01:30:39,230
Why'd you let Ma buy all this stuff?

1357
01:30:39,811 --> 01:30:43,441
The human animal is a beast
that eventually has to die.

1358
01:30:44,023 --> 01:30:47,693
If he's got money, he buys and he buys.

1359
01:30:48,486 --> 01:30:51,236
The reason why he buys
everything he can is because

1360
01:30:51,405 --> 01:30:55,405
of a crazy hope that one of the things
he buys will be life everlasting,

1361
01:30:55,576 --> 01:30:57,496
which it never can be.

1362
01:30:58,329 --> 01:31:02,129
I suddenly noticed that you don't call me
Big Daddy anymore.

1363
01:31:02,291 --> 01:31:05,341
If you needed a Big Daddy,
why didn't you come to me?

1364
01:31:05,503 --> 01:31:08,763
You wanted somebody to lean on, why
Skipper? Why not me? I'm your father.

1365
01:31:08,923 --> 01:31:12,473
I'm Big Daddy, me. Why didn't you come
to your kinfolk, to people that love you?

1366
01:31:12,635 --> 01:31:15,805
You don't know what love means.
To you it's just another four-letter word.

1367
01:31:15,972 --> 01:31:17,852
You got a mighty short memory.

1368
01:31:18,015 --> 01:31:20,555
What was it that you wanted
that I didn't buy for you?

1369
01:31:20,726 --> 01:31:21,936
You can't buy love!

1370
01:31:22,103 --> 01:31:24,153
You bought yourself
a million dollars worth of junk!

1371
01:31:24,313 --> 01:31:25,403
Look at it, does it love you?

1372
01:31:25,565 --> 01:31:27,355
Who'd you think I bought it for, me?
It's yours.

1373
01:31:27,525 --> 01:31:29,315
The place, the money,
every rotten thing yours!

1374
01:31:29,485 --> 01:31:31,315
I don't want things!

1375
01:31:33,898 --> 01:31:35,528
But we drew this, uh...

1376
01:31:37,577 --> 01:31:41,407
- I said we drew this up with the advice...
- Get out of the way.

1377
01:31:42,957 --> 01:31:45,377
- Get out of my way.
- We're settling this first.

1378
01:31:45,543 --> 01:31:48,633
- I don't want to see it.
- It's a plan. A preliminary.

1379
01:31:56,387 --> 01:31:57,597
Waste!

1380
01:32:07,899 --> 01:32:09,279
Worthless!

1381
01:32:11,861 --> 01:32:14,241
Worthless!

1382
01:32:18,242 --> 01:32:19,622
Worthless.

1383
01:32:41,724 --> 01:32:43,144
Don't, son.

1384
01:32:44,435 --> 01:32:46,685
- Please, don't cry, boy.
- No.

1385
01:33:00,993 --> 01:33:02,503
That's funny.

1386
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:06,580
I never saw you cry before.
How is that? Didn't you ever cry as a kid?

1387
01:33:06,749 --> 01:33:11,249
Can't you understand? I never wanted
your place or your money or...

1388
01:33:11,420 --> 01:33:13,630
I don't want to own anything.

1389
01:33:13,798 --> 01:33:16,548
All I wanted was a father, not a boss.

1390
01:33:17,635 --> 01:33:19,675
I wanted you to love me.

1391
01:33:19,971 --> 01:33:21,811
- I did and I do.
- No.

1392
01:33:22,598 --> 01:33:25,138
Not me, and not Gooper,
and not even Momma.

1393
01:33:25,309 --> 01:33:28,439
That's a lie. I did love her.
I'd give her everything, anything...

1394
01:33:28,604 --> 01:33:31,734
Things. Papa, you gave her things.

1395
01:33:31,899 --> 01:33:34,489
A house, a trip to Europe, all this junk.

1396
01:33:34,652 --> 01:33:38,452
Some jewelry. Things you gave her.
Things, Papa, not love.

1397
01:33:39,991 --> 01:33:41,911
I gave her an empire, boy.

1398
01:33:42,076 --> 01:33:45,036
I've seen you out there on your empire

1399
01:33:45,204 --> 01:33:48,254
with the men who run it for you.
You don't know their names,

1400
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:50,076
or if they've got kids,
or if they're happy.

1401
01:33:50,293 --> 01:33:52,383
You've never looked into their faces.

1402
01:33:52,545 --> 01:33:56,005
What are faces? You don't build an empire
by remembering faces.

1403
01:33:56,173 --> 01:33:59,223
Next week, I'm gonna start building
that textile plant.

1404
01:33:59,385 --> 01:34:03,345
I'll not only grow my own cotton,
I'll weave it and I'll market it.

1405
01:34:03,597 --> 01:34:07,227
I'll tell you, boy,
in a year or two years from now...

1406
01:34:20,406 --> 01:34:21,566
Yeah.

1407
01:34:22,616 --> 01:34:26,246
The men who build empires die,
and empires die, too.

1408
01:34:26,412 --> 01:34:28,502
No, it won't.

1409
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:32,460
- That's why I've got you and Gooper.
- Look at Gooper.

1410
01:34:32,626 --> 01:34:36,126
Look at what he's become.
Is that what you wanted him to be?

1411
01:34:36,297 --> 01:34:37,667
And look at me.

1412
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:39,880
You put it very well indeed.
I'm a 30-year-old kid.

1413
01:34:40,051 --> 01:34:42,391
And pretty soon,
I'm going to be a 50-year-old kid.

1414
01:34:42,553 --> 01:34:43,683
I don't know what to believe in.

1415
01:34:43,846 --> 01:34:46,016
What's the good of living
if you've got nothing to...

1416
01:34:46,182 --> 01:34:49,692
There's got to be some purpose in life,
some meaning.

1417
01:34:50,269 --> 01:34:53,899
Look at me, for the sake of God,
look at me, before it's too late!

1418
01:34:54,065 --> 01:34:56,975
For once in your life,
look at me as I really am.

1419
01:34:57,151 --> 01:34:58,571
Look at me!

1420
01:34:59,904 --> 01:35:01,454
I'm a failure. I'm a drunk.

1421
01:35:01,614 --> 01:35:05,284
On my own in the open market, I'm
not worth the price of a decent burial.

1422
01:35:05,451 --> 01:35:08,581
You and Gooper and the rest of you
blaming me for everything, huh?

1423
01:35:08,746 --> 01:35:11,746
No, Papa. Nobody, just a...

1424
01:35:13,501 --> 01:35:17,001
We've known each other all my life
and we're strangers.

1425
01:35:17,171 --> 01:35:21,761
You own 28,000 acres of the richest...
You own $10 million.

1426
01:35:21,926 --> 01:35:26,216
You own a wife and two children.
You own us, but you don't love us.

1427
01:35:27,306 --> 01:35:29,386
- In my own way...
- No, sir.

1428
01:35:30,309 --> 01:35:32,479
You don't even like people.

1429
01:35:33,479 --> 01:35:36,819
You wanted Gooper to have kids.
You want me to have kids. Why?

1430
01:35:37,858 --> 01:35:40,108
'Cause I want a part of me
to keep on living.

1431
01:35:40,319 --> 01:35:41,949
I won't have it end with the grave.

1432
01:35:42,113 --> 01:35:43,283
Look!

1433
01:35:43,948 --> 01:35:46,328
This is what my father left me.

1434
01:35:46,700 --> 01:35:48,580
A lousy old suitcase.

1435
01:35:48,911 --> 01:35:51,251
And on the inside was nothing.

1436
01:35:51,414 --> 01:35:55,004
Nothing but his uniform
from the Spanish-American War.

1437
01:35:55,334 --> 01:35:59,054
This was his legacy to me. Nothing at all!

1438
01:36:01,715 --> 01:36:04,335
And I built this place from nothing.

1439
01:36:09,598 --> 01:36:11,768
And that's all he left you?

1440
01:36:12,143 --> 01:36:14,193
Yeah, he was a hobo.

1441
01:36:16,397 --> 01:36:19,187
Best-known tramp on the boxcar circuit.

1442
01:36:19,400 --> 01:36:23,360
He worked once in a while
as a field hand, and I'd tag along.

1443
01:36:23,571 --> 01:36:26,911
Sat on my bare bottom in the dirt,
waiting for him.

1444
01:36:28,659 --> 01:36:32,459
Outside of hunger,
first thing I could remember is shame.

1445
01:36:33,122 --> 01:36:36,082
I was ashamed
of that miserable, old tramp.

1446
01:36:36,417 --> 01:36:38,837
I was riding boxcars
when I was nine years old,

1447
01:36:39,003 --> 01:36:40,803
something you never had to do.

1448
01:36:40,963 --> 01:36:44,433
And you'll never have to bury me either,
like I did him.

1449
01:36:45,050 --> 01:36:48,350
I buried him in a meadow
alongside a railroad track.

1450
01:36:48,512 --> 01:36:52,272
We was running to catch a freight
and his heart gave out.

1451
01:36:55,068 --> 01:36:56,898
You know something?

1452
01:36:57,771 --> 01:37:02,001
- That lousy old tramp died laughing.
- Laughing at what?

1453
01:37:03,068 --> 01:37:06,238
Himself, I guess. An old hobo tramp.

1454
01:37:06,614 --> 01:37:10,284
Not a nickel in his jeans, you know.
No future, no past.

1455
01:37:12,244 --> 01:37:15,374
Or maybe he was laughing
because he was happy.

1456
01:37:16,790 --> 01:37:18,830
Happy at having you with him.

1457
01:37:19,001 --> 01:37:22,301
He took you everywhere
and he kept you with him.

1458
01:37:23,464 --> 01:37:25,884
I don't want to talk about that.

1459
01:37:40,898 --> 01:37:42,648
Yeah, I loved him.

1460
01:37:46,779 --> 01:37:50,909
I reckon I never loved anything
as much as that lousy old tramp.

1461
01:37:53,410 --> 01:37:57,330
And you say he left you nothing
but a suitcase?

1462
01:37:57,540 --> 01:38:00,960
With a uniform in it
from the Spanish-American War?

1463
01:38:01,710 --> 01:38:03,460
And some memories.

1464
01:38:04,672 --> 01:38:06,012
And love.

1465
01:38:11,887 --> 01:38:14,307
Did I tell you all those stories
about my old man?

1466
01:38:14,473 --> 01:38:16,353
Yeah, about 50 times.

1467
01:38:30,573 --> 01:38:32,493
It's only a plan to protect
the biggest estate in the Delta

1468
01:38:32,658 --> 01:38:35,318
- from irresponsibility.
- Momma, you got to sign.

1469
01:38:37,371 --> 01:38:39,251
Maggie, where is it?

1470
01:38:40,791 --> 01:38:43,291
- What, Momma?
- What the doctor left

1471
01:38:43,460 --> 01:38:45,420
to make his pain easier.

1472
01:38:45,588 --> 01:38:49,218
Brick's down there with him.
Brick will help Big Daddy.

1473
01:38:49,383 --> 01:38:51,013
Help him? How?

1474
01:38:51,176 --> 01:38:53,296
- By running a 100-yard dash?
- Oh, shut up, Mae.

1475
01:38:53,470 --> 01:38:56,640
Maybe he'll cheer Big Daddy up
by kicking a couple of field goals.

1476
01:38:56,807 --> 01:38:59,637
One more crack, Queenie, just one,

1477
01:38:59,810 --> 01:39:03,900
and I will not only spit in your eye,
but I will punch it black and blue.

1478
01:39:04,064 --> 01:39:05,074
Now hold on a minute.

1479
01:39:05,232 --> 01:39:07,822
- I'm not gonna listen to anymore slander...
- Mae was only saying...

1480
01:39:07,985 --> 01:39:10,735
I know what she's saying
and I know exactly what she meant.

1481
01:39:10,904 --> 01:39:12,954
The only world that Brick knows
is a world that he...

1482
01:39:13,115 --> 01:39:15,195
It's not a world he made.

1483
01:39:19,330 --> 01:39:20,540
Ladies.

1484
01:39:22,124 --> 01:39:24,464
- No.
- Why won't you take it?

1485
01:39:25,628 --> 01:39:29,008
- It'll kill the pain that's all.
- It'll kill the senses, too.

1486
01:39:29,173 --> 01:39:31,683
When you've got pain,
at least you know you're alive.

1487
01:39:38,098 --> 01:39:40,178
It's easing somewhat now.

1488
01:39:42,019 --> 01:39:47,266
When you got pain, it's better to
judge yourself than a lot of things.

1489
01:39:47,441 --> 01:39:49,901
I'm not going to stupefy myself
with that stuff.

1490
01:39:50,069 --> 01:39:51,739
I want to think clear.

1491
01:39:51,904 --> 01:39:54,534
I want to see everything
and I want to feel everything.

1492
01:39:54,698 --> 01:39:56,738
Then I won't mind going.

1493
01:39:57,618 --> 01:39:59,698
I've got the guts to die.

1494
01:39:59,912 --> 01:40:03,082
What I want to know is,
have you got the guts to live?

1495
01:40:03,248 --> 01:40:04,748
I don't know.

1496
01:40:06,043 --> 01:40:07,463
We can try.

1497
01:40:09,588 --> 01:40:12,928
Could start by helping each other
up these stairs.

1498
01:40:25,062 --> 01:40:26,402
Yes, sir.

1499
01:40:29,775 --> 01:40:31,065
The least you can do is read them.

1500
01:40:31,235 --> 01:40:33,275
You put those papers away
before I tear them up.

1501
01:40:33,445 --> 01:40:35,905
I don't know what's in them.
I don't want to know what's in them.

1502
01:40:36,073 --> 01:40:37,913
I'm talking in Big Daddy's language now.

1503
01:40:38,075 --> 01:40:40,735
I'm his wife, not his widow.
I'm still his wife.

1504
01:40:40,911 --> 01:40:43,251
- Yeah. But what I got here...
- He's explained it's just a plan.

1505
01:40:43,414 --> 01:40:46,984
Plan. Basis. What I say to your plan is...

1506
01:40:48,335 --> 01:40:51,915
Maggie, what is it Big Daddy says
when he's disgusted?

1507
01:40:52,256 --> 01:40:55,216
He says "bull" when he's disgusted.

1508
01:40:55,384 --> 01:40:58,014
That's right.
I say "bull," too, like Big Daddy.

1509
01:40:58,178 --> 01:40:59,968
Coarse language don't seem called for
to me.

1510
01:41:00,139 --> 01:41:01,139
Bull!

1511
01:41:01,306 --> 01:41:03,476
Something in me is deeply outraged
by all this kind of talk.

1512
01:41:03,642 --> 01:41:06,402
Then stop talking like your father was dead.
And me along with him.

1513
01:41:06,562 --> 01:41:09,442
What about her? She wants her share, too.

1514
01:41:09,857 --> 01:41:14,607
As far as Brick is concerned,
nobody's going to take nothing.

1515
01:41:14,987 --> 01:41:16,737
Not till Big Daddy lets go,

1516
01:41:16,905 --> 01:41:20,405
and maybe just possibly, not even then.

1517
01:41:21,285 --> 01:41:23,365
No, Momma, not even then.

1518
01:41:27,458 --> 01:41:29,958
Hello, Bucky Boy. Oh!

1519
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:34,630
Looks like the wind
took some liberties with this place.

1520
01:41:34,798 --> 01:41:36,798
- Evening, Captain.
- Evening, Captain.

1521
01:41:36,967 --> 01:41:39,797
- Storm cross over the river?
- Gone to Arkansas, Captain.

1522
01:41:39,970 --> 01:41:41,640
Rain do some good, Captain?

1523
01:41:41,805 --> 01:41:43,595
Some good I reckon.

1524
01:41:45,267 --> 01:41:46,637
Some good.

1525
01:41:48,353 --> 01:41:49,863
The least you can do is read them.

1526
01:41:50,022 --> 01:41:52,362
You put those papers away
before I tear them up.

1527
01:41:52,524 --> 01:41:55,694
I don't know what's in them.
I don't want to know what's in them.

1528
01:41:56,528 --> 01:41:58,358
Well, can I come in?

1529
01:41:59,782 --> 01:42:02,452
The storm done any damage, Big Daddy?

1530
01:42:02,618 --> 01:42:04,658
What storm you talking about?
The one on the outside,

1531
01:42:04,828 --> 01:42:07,368
or that hullabaloo
I heard going on in here?

1532
01:42:15,214 --> 01:42:17,014
Uh, excuse me, sir.

1533
01:42:17,174 --> 01:42:18,634
Heard some mighty loud talking.

1534
01:42:18,801 --> 01:42:22,181
Sounded like something important being
discussed. What's the pow-wow about?

1535
01:42:22,346 --> 01:42:24,886
Nothing, Big Daddy. Nothing at all.

1536
01:42:25,808 --> 01:42:28,558
What's in them important-looking
documents you got there, Gooper?

1537
01:42:28,727 --> 01:42:32,057
These, sir?
Nothing. Nothing much anything at all.

1538
01:42:32,314 --> 01:42:36,856
Then what are you and Sister Woman
scurrying and scrounging around for?

1539
01:42:37,486 --> 01:42:40,356
Looks like a whole lot of nothing to me.

1540
01:42:43,325 --> 01:42:45,695
What's that smell in this room?

1541
01:42:46,245 --> 01:42:48,535
Didn't you notice it, Brick?

1542
01:42:48,705 --> 01:42:53,415
Didn't you notice a powerful and
obnoxious odor of mendacity in this room?

1543
01:42:56,046 --> 01:42:58,416
Yes, sir, I think I did.

1544
01:42:58,924 --> 01:43:02,594
Ain't nothing more powerful
than the odor of mendacity.

1545
01:43:03,428 --> 01:43:05,888
- Didn't you notice it, Gooper?
- What, sir?

1546
01:43:06,056 --> 01:43:08,096
What about you, Sister Woman?

1547
01:43:08,267 --> 01:43:12,397
Didn't you notice an unpleasant smell
of mendacity in this room?

1548
01:43:12,563 --> 01:43:14,813
Big Daddy, I don't even know what that is.

1549
01:43:14,973 --> 01:43:17,943
You can smell it. It smells like death.

1550
01:43:22,948 --> 01:43:24,698
What's the matter
with that woman over there?

1551
01:43:24,867 --> 01:43:27,447
Hey, what's-your-name.
What's the matter with you?

1552
01:43:27,619 --> 01:43:30,119
She just had a slight dizzy spell.

1553
01:43:30,289 --> 01:43:34,249
You better watch that, Big Momma.
A stroke's a bad way to go.

1554
01:43:35,961 --> 01:43:39,381
Look, Momma,
he's wearing Brick's birthday present.

1555
01:43:40,799 --> 01:43:44,299
I haven't given you my present, yet,
but I will now.

1556
01:43:44,761 --> 01:43:48,811
- I have an announcement to make.
- What kind of an announcement?

1557
01:43:49,975 --> 01:43:52,555
An announcement of life beginning.

1558
01:43:54,771 --> 01:43:56,611
A child is coming,

1559
01:43:57,816 --> 01:44:00,566
sired by Brick out of Maggie The Cat.

1560
01:44:04,281 --> 01:44:06,661
I have Brick's child in my body.

1561
01:44:07,451 --> 01:44:09,791
And that is my present to you.

1562
01:44:10,287 --> 01:44:13,827
Ever in your born days
ever hear such a bald-faced lie?

1563
01:44:13,999 --> 01:44:15,289
Shut up.

1564
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:19,630
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1565
01:44:33,810 --> 01:44:36,860
Yes, indeed,
this girl has life in her body.

1566
01:44:38,649 --> 01:44:40,279
And that's no lie.

1567
01:44:40,442 --> 01:44:43,952
Gooper, I want my lawyer in the morning.
My lawyer.

1568
01:44:46,365 --> 01:44:48,365
- Brick.
- Yes, Big Daddy?

1569
01:44:51,203 --> 01:44:54,623
I'm going out to look this place over
before I give it up.

1570
01:44:54,790 --> 01:44:57,170
The place and the people on it.

1571
01:44:59,211 --> 01:45:00,381
Ida.

1572
01:45:02,756 --> 01:45:04,216
You want to come along with me?

1573
01:45:13,475 --> 01:45:16,055
Brick, what, eh...

1574
01:45:18,397 --> 01:45:20,817
What were you and Big Daddy
talking about down there?

1575
01:45:20,983 --> 01:45:23,033
- Us.
- Me, too?

1576
01:45:24,194 --> 01:45:27,914
- Yeah, you, too.
- You ripped him apart. Your own brother.

1577
01:45:29,157 --> 01:45:31,237
You believe that, Gooper?

1578
01:45:34,997 --> 01:45:36,497
- No.
- Well, I do!

1579
01:45:36,665 --> 01:45:37,665
Keep still.

1580
01:45:37,833 --> 01:45:42,253
A family crisis brings out the best and
the worst in every member of the family.

1581
01:45:42,421 --> 01:45:44,011
That's the truth.

1582
01:45:44,172 --> 01:45:45,342
Amen.

1583
01:45:46,591 --> 01:45:49,761
You want to talk about the truth?
You're not pregnant.

1584
01:45:49,928 --> 01:45:51,558
- Be still, Mae.
- She made it up.

1585
01:45:51,722 --> 01:45:54,272
- I said, shut up.
- Don't you try to kid us, Maggie.

1586
01:45:54,433 --> 01:45:55,563
Mae.

1587
01:45:56,268 --> 01:45:58,098
She's not kidding you.

1588
01:45:58,270 --> 01:46:01,270
How can she have a child by you,
when you won't even...

1589
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:02,940
Will you keep quiet?

1590
01:46:03,108 --> 01:46:06,898
We occupy the next room.
The walls between aren't soundproof.

1591
01:46:07,070 --> 01:46:10,700
We hear the nightly pleading
and the nightly refusals.

1592
01:46:10,866 --> 01:46:14,786
Sister Woman, not everybody makes
as much noise about love as you do.

1593
01:46:18,457 --> 01:46:21,957
Brick, I never thought
that you would stoop to her level.

1594
01:46:22,127 --> 01:46:25,297
You heard what Big Daddy said,
"That girl's got life in her body."

1595
01:46:25,464 --> 01:46:26,724
- That's a lie!
- No.

1596
01:46:28,633 --> 01:46:31,393
No. No, truth is something desperate.
And Maggie's got it.

1597
01:46:31,553 --> 01:46:34,813
Believe me, it is desperate.
And she has got it.

1598
01:46:36,725 --> 01:46:39,305
Why don't you say something, honey?

1599
01:46:40,103 --> 01:46:42,983
All right, honey. Shut up!

1600
01:46:43,648 --> 01:46:44,898
Maggie.

1601
01:46:47,319 --> 01:46:49,489
- Yes?
- Come on up here.

1602
01:46:51,615 --> 01:46:52,735
Yes, sir!

1603
01:47:00,665 --> 01:47:04,335
Yeah. That girl's got life in her,
all right.

1604
01:47:07,798 --> 01:47:10,008
Thank you for keeping still.

1605
01:47:10,675 --> 01:47:12,965
For backing me up in my lie.

1606
01:47:13,220 --> 01:47:14,850
Oh, Maggie.

1607
01:47:15,013 --> 01:47:18,353
We are through with lies
and liars in this house.

1608
01:47:20,685 --> 01:47:21,845
Lock the door.
