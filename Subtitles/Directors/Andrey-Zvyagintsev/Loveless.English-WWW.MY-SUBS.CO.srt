Maybe he married one more time.

167
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,500
- I see.

168
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:39,780
So, if you divorce and then quickly remarry,
you can get unnoticed?

169
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:42,160
- If your families aren't too close friends.

170
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,160
- My family isn't.

171
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:45,760
- Then who cares.

172
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,230
- Well, yeah.

173
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:54,660
Look, and where from do you know about this IT guy?

174
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:00,980
- Well, first of all,

175
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,980
he's not an IT guy.

176
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,240
I said it on purpose.

177
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,920
He's from a different department,

178
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,880
don't ask from which.

179
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:11,660
Second of all,

180
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:16,110
I know it from the source.

181
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:19,220
Well, you got it.

182
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,920
By the way,
I haven't talked to him for a long time,

183
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,120
lack of time.

184
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,140
Just

185
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,690
saying hello to each other, sometimes, from afar.

186
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:30,690
- You won't tell anybody, right?

187
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,320
- Just like during a confession, don't worry.

188
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,320
- What do you think,
will there be the end of the world?

189
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,020
- For sure.

190
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,420
Will you hand me some material to work with?

191
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,020
Have anything?

192
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,020
God said we must share.

193
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:13,320
- Maybe I'll get something in the evening.

194
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,320
- This will a mutual benefit, don't worry.

195
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,180
- Mhm.

196
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,180
- Oh my...

197
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:22,080
- He's worrying a lot.

198
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,310
- Good, let him worry.

199
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:24,210
- He's suffering, poor guy.

200
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:27,820
- Good. They all are masters at messing things up,
how about cleaning things?

201
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,380
- You think he's worrying about the kid?

202
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,620
Yeah, right.

203
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,880
Ha has loans from the bank, he's afraid of getting fired.

204
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:39,140
You know, his boss is all so Orthodox, to the bone.

205
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,260
- A fundamentalist?

206
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:40,900
- Mhm.

207
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:43,860
Has a huge beard while wearing a Brioni-costume.

208
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,110
- A glamorous guy?

209
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,260
- Indeed.

210
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,080
He started an Orthodox shariah there.

211
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,000
You get a job only if you're married.

212
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,520
And baptized, of course.

213
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,400
And during our vacations we had a pilgrimage
all around the temples.

214
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,600
- Yeah, I remember. On the other hand,

215
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,160
it's kind of cool. Exoticism.

216
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,640
- Oh come on, it's so boring.

217
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,220
- Bend your leg, shall we.

218
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,920
- But he has a big salary for that.

219
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,740
So, as I see, he's really getting nervous.

220
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,850
- You think he can really get fired?

221
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:10,440
- The hell I know.

222
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,580
I really hope.

223
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,270
- And what about the alimony?

224
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,240
- Ouch!

225
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,620
Are you kidding me?

226
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,470
- Hey, there's very little left, relax.

227
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:18,880
My friend told me once

228
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,660
that her boss is fond of extreme sports.

229
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:22,430
- Really?
- Yes.

230
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:26,060
So he's taking them to parachute or to canoe

231
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,280
or to downhill-ski.

232
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:29,280
- Downhill-skiing is cool.

233
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,110
- Well...

234
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:32,530
The knee of my friend broke,

235
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:34,470
so she had to wear a cast for half a year.

236
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:35,540
Goodbye the ligament.

237
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:36,610
- Hardcore...

238
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:39,970
- So some of them started buying
certificates on the internet

239
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,120
about the heart condition
or the blood-pressure.

240
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,650
- And?
- Got fired.

241
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:46,730
- If you're ill, go to a hospital.
- Holy crap.

242
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:48,660
- So, the temples of yours,

243
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:51,510
those prayers - all that is still bearable.
Turn over.

244
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:54,460
- Well, I don't know. I think...

245
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:57,380
Vacations mean summer, sunshine, a beach,

246
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:59,990
an all-inclusive hotel...

247
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,530
- And what does your new boyfriend say about this?

248
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:05,330
- He's fine with it.

249
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,360
He's so, you know, up-to-date.

250
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,440
- Well, he has the money,

251
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,640
he's healthy. Why not be up-to-date?

252
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,230
- Knock on the wood...

253
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:15,570
- Don't worry, I'm not a hoodoo.

254
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:17,990
- I'm not superstitious, too, it was just a reflex.

255
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:19,650
- So, is he divorced? Any kids?

256
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:21,110
- Yeah. Divorces 3 years ago.

257
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:23,750
The daughter is grown-up, she's studying abroad,

258
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:25,030
in Portugal, I think.

259
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:26,200
And works there, too.

260
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,360
- And how old is he?

261
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,680
-47.

262
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:30,480
- He's looking good.

263
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,460
- He does some Chinese exercises.

264
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,430
Doesn't smoke, almost doesn't drink.

265
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:36,860
- I'm even jealous.

266
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:39,640
So, I even it up?
- Just a bit.

267
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:44,630
- And how does he feel about your boy?

268
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:46,000
- Nothing particular.

269
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,590
Looks like this boy of mine hates me.

270
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:50,640
He's just like his father.

271
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,490
Even starts to smell like him.

272
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:54,890
- Secondary sexual characteristics,
he's growing up.

273
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:57,550
And did you want him to stay an angel
all the time?

274
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:00,200
- He may look like an angel,
- Oh, hi, will you wait?

275
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,210
- But he's actually all so spiky,

276
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:05,310
he almost tore me during childbirth -
didn't want to get out.

277
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:07,380
I was delivering almost 24-hours.

278
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:10,570
- Yeah, the life is hard...

279
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,900
Just like my tyke.

280
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,600
Everytime I look at her I realize a sad fact

281
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,200
that she's just like her father.

282
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,400
I hope he died there in his Kapotnya.

283
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,330
- Look.

284
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,010
- Yeah...

285
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:27,060
But you know, she doesn't drink.

286
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:29,850
I told her that I'll kill her immediately.

287
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:31,650
She's a girl of a character.

288
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:34,010
But not like her father, more like his mother.

289
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:34,960
She's such a bitch.

290
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,790
- I forgot, how old is your daughter?

291
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:39,130
-19, but she's real stupid.

292
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:40,550
Well no, she's smart,

293
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,130
she finished the school, exams,

294
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:45,360
but doesn't want to study anymore,
no matter what you do.

295
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:47,310
All she wants is to roam around.

296
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:50,330
I tell her: "If you get pregnant, your life is ruined.

297
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:53,010
Don't count on me".
And she says: "I have safe sex".

298
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:54,670
- Well, at least that.

299
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:57,680
- I don't know how she'll live further.

300
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,040
No profession, no desire whatsoever.

301
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,810
I tell her: "Who do you want to be?"
"A member of Parliament".

302
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:04,950
I say: "Study while you still have time".

303
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:07,850
She says: "You don't need to study to be an MP".

304
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:08,760
What can I say.

305
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,490
- So your daughter is clever!

306
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:12,230
- It's because she's just like me.

307
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,220
- Yes?

308
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,220
- Zhenya, come downstairs, please.

309
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,200
- Mhm.

310
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,680
- Why you don't tell me anything?

311
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,020
- What do you mean?

312
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:01,580
- How did it go with the flat yesterday,
what did the buyers say?

313
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,520
- They said they'll think.

314
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,350
Eh, Masha,

315
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:09,010
if there was any progress,
I would have certainly told you.

316
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:11,200
- Why can't you sell it for all this time?

317
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,390
Aren't you working in the Sales Department?

318
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:18,340
- You realize that those are
different things, don't you?

319
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,910
- No, I don't.

320
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:23,150
Don't take the pelmeni,
my mom said no pelmeni.

321
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:26,350
- Where's she tonight? At home?

322
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,150
- Oh,

323
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,950
she left for her auntie.

324
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,950
I got tired of her myself.

325
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,000
Tonight we're alone.

326
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,500
- Thank God.

327
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,380
- How can you say that? She's my mother!

328
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,380
Hey, go take the broccoli.

329
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:49,950
-1275, please.

330
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,740
- Borya.

331
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,140
Wait.

332
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:03,270
Everything is going to be alright with us, right?

333
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:08,130
You won't leave us, right?

334
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,960
- What?

335
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,120
Masha...

336
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:15,180
Are you crazy?

337
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:17,700
Where do those thoughts come from?

338
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,820
- I just sometimes get so scared...

339
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:26,820
- I'm with you.

340
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:32,120
- You must have been saying the same
to your ex-wife.

341
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,740
- Me and you, we are a completely
different story.

342
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,740
There was no one who made me feel so happy.

343
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:47,470
- And how many were there?

344
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:55,270
More than 10?

345
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:57,470
- I'm quite hungry, what about you?

346
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,990
- I'm always hungry these days.

347
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,060
By the way, I feel offended.

348
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,340
- I'll go cook something.

349
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:09,060
- Bring me an apple.

350
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,160
- Catch it.

351
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,350
Boiled chicken and broccoli, huh?

352
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:30,720
- I don't want.

353
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:33,510
I want a salad with cucumbers and tomatoes.

354
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,900
- Wow, a salad with cucumbers and tomatoes...

355
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:53,860
- "Got a tooth pulled in a dream. What does it mean?"

356
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,700
- Hi!
- Hi.

357
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,580
- Why are you so early?

358
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:14,740
I was expecting you later,
I barely managed to get off work.

359
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,740
My girls didn't want me to leave.

360
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,480
There are still lots of customers.

361
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:21,150
So, where are we going?

362
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,460
M?

363
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:24,030
Why are you silent?

364
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:27,230
Come on and tell me where we are going
this time!

365
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:31,020
Look, can we first get a watermelon on the way?

366
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,090
- Young lady,

367
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:47,290
do you have a second to tell me your number?

368
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:49,290
8-9...?

369
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:51,510
-25

370
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:54,350
88.

371
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:55,940
- And your name?

372
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,420
- Sofia.

373
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:46,560
- I can't eat when I'm observed like that.

374
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:48,270
- Sorry.

375
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:52,110
- Okay, I was kidding.

376
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:56,890
- You got new hair cut, or is it just me?

377
00:37:57,890 --> 00:37:58,810
- You noticed.

378
00:37:59,010 --> 00:37:59,930
- Of course.

379
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,580
I'm looking closely at you.

380
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,580
- You still are?

381
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:07,420
After all we've done?

382
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:12,530
- Especially after all we've done.

383
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:17,990
- After what we've done
the day before yesterday?

384
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,120
Or the day before
the day before yesterday?

385
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:23,660
- Zhenya...

386
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:26,140
- What?

387
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,830
What's the matter?

388
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,220
Something's wrong?

389
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:40,620
[Voices in the background, suggesting to have a drink]

390
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:42,670
- Girls, let's drink for love!

391
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:44,110
For love!

392
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:46,210
- You my beauties!

393
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:48,470
Let's make a selfie!

394
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:50,730
- For love and selfie!

395
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,350
- Hey?

396
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,720
You're asleep?

397
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:06,470
It's not fair.

398
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,360
I love you.

399
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,070
Do you hear?

400
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,960
I never loved anyone.

401
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:42,200
Only my mother when I was a child.

402
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,740
And she was so blunt with me.

403
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,520
Never caressed.

404
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,120
Never said a kind word.

405
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:57,250
Only the discipline, the order, the studying.

406
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,910
Wicked and lonely wretch.

407
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:03,830
- She is alive and well, I hope?

408
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:06,270
- Alive.

409
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:10,290
And actually quite healthy.

410
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:16,950
We don't talk much.

411
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:20,450
Every time I call we end up in a scandal.

412
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:23,210
Even later on, I cannot understand why.

413
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:25,210
Who started it.

414
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:47,110
Only with you I realized what love is.

415
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:51,810
I didn't love my husband.

416
00:43:53,810 --> 00:43:55,810
And before him I had no one.

417
00:43:57,910 --> 00:44:00,550
And even with him, I got pregnant by mistake.

418
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:06,470
He was so happy, suggested to get married.

419
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:09,450
"Everything is fine, we're together".

420
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:12,890
But I didn't want that.

421
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:17,490
I was so scared.

422
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:25,340
I was afraid to do the abortion,
I was afraid to keep it.

423
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:30,060
Didn't want it so much.

424
00:44:36,350 --> 00:44:39,110
When I was delivering I thought I was gonna die.

425
00:44:39,170 --> 00:44:40,760
They had me in critical care.

426
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,970
And then, when they brought him,

427
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:48,250
I couldn't even look at him.

428
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:51,810
Like some kind of disgust.

429
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:58,060
I even didn't have milk.

430
00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:12,870
Later it somehow got better,

431
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:14,850
some life started.

432
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:17,310
Some.

433
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
- Un-love.

434
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:24,300
- You can't live in un-love.

435
00:45:38,350 --> 00:45:40,600
- Even now, when I look at him or think about him,

436
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,600
like right now,

437
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:47,560
it seems like I have made
some unforgivable mistake.

438
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:53,990
I blame him and I blame myself.

439
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:02,360
How much do I want to be happy!

440
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:09,530
I'm a bitch, ain't I?

441
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,530
- Of course.

442
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:19,200
You're the loveliest bitch in the world.

443
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:28,930
- You really love me?

444
00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:32,140
- Come to me.

445
00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:13,200
- Yeah, hello.

446
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,400
- Did you see Alyosha yesterday evening?

447
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:18,140
- No, I didn't come home last night. Why?

448
00:50:18,830 --> 00:50:20,030
- The school called right now,

449
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:22,570
they said he wasn't there
neither today not yesterday.

450
00:50:22,850 --> 00:50:24,210
- What do you mean?

451
00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:25,730
And who called?

452
00:50:25,930 --> 00:50:27,250
- The head teacher.

453
00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:29,320
- The head teacher?

454
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:30,570
And what did she say?

455
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:31,790
- That he wasn't there!

456
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:34,470
Neither today, not yesterday! Are you deaf or what?

457
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:35,770
- Had he been in at home?

458
00:50:35,970 --> 00:50:37,140
- I don't know!

459
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:41,490
I came yesterday at night,
I thought he's sleeping.

460
00:50:41,690 --> 00:50:43,380
Woke up late today.

461
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:45,830
I thought he's already left, as usually.

462
00:50:45,850 --> 00:50:47,910
His phone is off, has he called you?

463
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:49,170
- No.

464
00:50:51,170 --> 00:50:52,250
- Dear God...

465
00:50:52,890 --> 00:50:55,060
- Stop panicking, he'll come back,
what else will he do.

466
00:50:55,730 --> 00:50:57,310
We need to call that...

467
00:50:57,510 --> 00:50:58,490
the friend of his.

468
00:50:58,690 --> 00:51:00,250
- I already have, he hadn't seen him either.

469
00:51:00,450 --> 00:51:01,590
Neither today, not yesterday.

470
00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:03,850
- I see.

471
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:07,290
And where are you now?

472
00:51:07,490 --> 00:51:08,830
- At home, where else.

473
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:12,010
- And you fuckin cannot understand if he
had been home or not?

474
00:51:12,210 --> 00:51:13,500
- I damn cannot!

475
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:14,530
- Why?

476
00:51:14,870 --> 00:51:16,030
It's easy.

477
00:51:16,330 --> 00:51:18,790
- Then come and see yourself!

478
00:51:20,790 --> 00:51:22,790
- I'm at work, in case you didn't know.

479
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:25,250
- We haven't heard of him
for more than 24-hours,

480
00:51:25,410 --> 00:51:26,470
do you get this or not?

481
00:51:27,830 --> 00:51:30,670
- Maybe he's in the elevator
right now, for example.

482
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,880
I think you're exaggerating.

483
00:51:34,990 --> 00:51:35,890
He must have done something

484
00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:38,310
and is afraid now that
you'll give him a beating.

485
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:40,310
That's why he's roaming around somewhere...

486
00:51:41,190 --> 00:51:43,190
- So, I'm at fault now, right?

487
00:51:44,670 --> 00:51:45,690
- You even...

488
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:49,280
You don't even know if he had been at home or not.

489
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,680
He probably had.

490
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:56,650
Hello?

491
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:01,390
Hello?

492
00:52:02,330 --> 00:52:03,790
- Listen.

493
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:06,140
I'm calling the police right now,

494
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:07,970
and you can keep sitting at your work

495
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:10,200
and speculate what may had been
and what may not.

496
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,320
Got it?

497
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:12,440
Blockhead!

498
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:40,320
- Dasha, look,

499
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:42,590
one office worker

500
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:44,790
says to another office worker:

501
00:52:44,990 --> 00:52:46,610
"What car do you have?"

502
00:52:46,810 --> 00:52:48,230
"Volkswagen Passat"

503
00:52:48,430 --> 00:52:49,950
"And I have Volkswagen Credit"

504
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:53,120
- So funny.

505
00:52:53,850 --> 00:52:54,870
- Look,

506
00:52:55,070 --> 00:52:55,990
one office worker...

507
00:52:56,190 --> 00:52:58,190
- Wait wait wait, Seryozha...

508
00:53:01,050 --> 00:53:02,070
- It was funny.

509
00:53:37,670 --> 00:53:38,840
- I've finished.

510
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:41,210
- Good, thank you.

511
00:53:41,410 --> 00:53:43,210
Take that.

512
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:49,420
Wait for me in the car,
we have one more call.

513
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:50,350
- Okay.

514
00:53:51,390 --> 00:53:52,950
- What can I say.

515
00:53:53,150 --> 00:53:54,720
I see no crime here.

516
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:56,920
- What crime?

517
00:53:57,620 --> 00:53:58,940
- You know, sometimes

518
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:00,790
the parents finish off their child

519
00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:02,990
and then claim that the child got lost.

520
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:05,300
- You thought that way about me?

521
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:08,030
- That's the version we check the first.

522
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:10,090
Here we have a "runner", the usual case.

523
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:11,640
12 years old, a rebel-heart,

524
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:12,880
full of hormones.

525
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:15,870
He'll roam around for a couple of days
and will come back.

526
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,610
Well, we can, of course, go to the Department,

527
00:54:18,810 --> 00:54:21,030
spend a couple of hours filling a detailed form -

528
00:54:21,230 --> 00:54:23,030
and probably already not today.

529
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:26,330
At least because your husband
must be present as well.

530
00:54:27,390 --> 00:54:28,800
And even then,

531
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:32,440
I think this case won't go further
than the material checking.

532
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:38,280
- You say there's no crime.

533
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:41,310
And what if he was kidnapped?

534
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:43,210
Cause I can't even imagine

535
00:54:43,410 --> 00:54:44,430
where he can be now.

536
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:47,180
- He must be roaming somewhere around the block.

537
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:48,980
He won't last long.

538
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:51,940
He's used to the comfort, and it's right here.

539
00:54:52,510 --> 00:54:55,700
They come back to such families
that you couldn't even imagine.

540
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:59,080
Cause the street is not a home,
no matter how shitty the latter is.

541
00:54:59,150 --> 00:55:01,150
And considering the kidnapping,

542
00:55:01,350 --> 00:55:02,670
This is how it goes:

543
00:55:02,870 --> 00:55:04,870
First, there's the material checking. It means:

544
00:55:05,070 --> 00:55:07,320
Examining the parents, relatives,

545
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:09,520
friends, possible witnesses and so on.

546
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:11,610
We don't have enough staff for it.

547
00:55:11,810 --> 00:55:14,090
Plus, there are a lot of other cases -

548
00:55:14,290 --> 00:55:16,570
robberies, murders, burglaries, thuggery.

549
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:20,430
Thus, collecting materials can last
a couple of days.

550
00:55:20,630 --> 00:55:23,310
If by then the "runner" doesn't come back,

551
00:55:23,510 --> 00:55:25,800
the searching operations begin.

552
00:55:25,810 --> 00:55:28,220
And if during them we find reasons,

553
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:31,820
i.e. factual evidence of murder or kidnapping,

554
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:34,000
then criminal proceedings are initiated.

555
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:36,720
But it is initiated by
the investigating committee.

556
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:39,450
You know yourself, how long can it take.

557
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:41,790
The writing itself takes forever.

558
00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:43,500
During this time they usually

559
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:45,200
come back and run away again.

560
00:55:45,430 --> 00:55:47,200
- So, you won't do anything, right?

561
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:50,320
- Ma'am, I'm explaining the real situation.

562
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:52,370
We must react and we will.

563
00:55:52,570 --> 00:55:54,220
But in this particular case

564
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:57,880
we physically don't have time or staff
to keep chasing every teenager.

565
00:55:58,130 --> 00:55:59,410
- I got it.

566
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:02,300
The case will be thrown to a trash-bin, right?

567
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:03,650
And what do I do?

568
00:56:03,850 --> 00:56:05,610
Just sit and wait till he returns?

569
00:56:05,810 --> 00:56:07,570
And what if he doesn't return?

570
00:56:07,790 --> 00:56:09,570
- Facts are stubborn things...

571
00:56:09,770 --> 00:56:10,970
In most cases

572
00:56:11,170 --> 00:56:14,080
the teenage "runners" come back
in a week's time,

573
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:16,080
in 10 days at most.

574
00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:18,940
What I can advise is,

575
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:21,290
If you really want to start looking for him,

576
00:56:21,490 --> 00:56:22,460
go to the internet,

577
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:25,590
to the web-page of the search-and-rescue squad,

578
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:28,440
call them, give them all the information,

579
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,420
they'll tell which information they need.

580
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:33,370
They are volunteers, not a government service.

581
00:56:33,830 --> 00:56:36,730
They work 24-hours, for free,

582
00:56:36,930 --> 00:56:38,930
without any bureaucracy,

583
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:42,070
A well-developed highly-efficient
algorithm of actions.

584
00:56:42,590 --> 00:56:45,910
Where do I know from?
Have been collaborating, productively.

585
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:49,990
Look, here's my card.

586
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:53,100
Your phone number

587
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:55,940
has already been written down,
we'll stay in touch.

588
00:56:56,350 --> 00:56:57,720
- Is that it?

589
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:59,290
- For now, yes.

590
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:01,510
- Unreal.

591
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:02,850
- Listen.

592
00:57:03,050 --> 00:57:05,390
If it were any other officer,

593
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:08,310
it would have been
much harsher and less informative.

594
00:57:08,510 --> 00:57:10,310
And it's not because I'm so kind.

595
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:13,550
It's because I save my time, yours
and volunteers'.

596
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:15,300
Who will start searching

597
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:16,860
the sooner you contact them.

598
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:21,760
And they will find your fool
somewhere in the streets or in a mall.

599
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:23,770
And most probably, at some place of his friend's,

600
00:57:23,970 --> 00:57:27,230
whose parents went away for a day or two
so that he's alone now.

601
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:29,110
So, take actions.

602
00:57:29,310 --> 00:57:32,540
Or keep waiting, it's up to you.

603
00:58:31,110 --> 00:58:33,110
- When have you spoken to him last time?

604
00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:35,700
- I just saw him leaving for school.

605
00:58:36,630 --> 00:58:38,630
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

606
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:40,400
- I'm sorry, there are traffic jams.

607
00:58:41,070 --> 00:58:43,670
- Take a seat, engage yourself,
my name's Ivan,

608
00:58:43,870 --> 00:58:46,470
I'm the coordinator
of the search-and-rescue squad.

609
00:58:46,670 --> 00:58:48,540
- Yes, my wife told me on the phone.

610
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:51,390
- Great. Then, let's start. I mean, continue.

611
00:58:51,590 --> 00:58:54,740
So, I say it one more time
so that there are fewer questions.

612
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:57,900
Now I'm going to carefully ask you
about your son, Alyosha,

613
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:01,760
while other searchers are surveying
the neighbours, possible witnesses,

614
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:05,040
on the streets, in the shops,
everywhere where he could have been seen.

615
00:59:05,290 --> 00:59:05,670
Yes, Lena?

616
00:59:05,870 --> 00:59:07,350
- The neighbours got nothing.

617
00:59:07,550 --> 00:59:08,000
- Nothing at all?

618
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:10,630
- Nobody has seen him, neither yesterday, not today.

619
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:11,670
They can't remember.

620
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:14,650
There are more of us now, in the parking place.

621
00:59:14,850 --> 00:59:16,620
- Good.
- And we have the posters now.

622
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:18,180
- Oh, got printed? Good job.

623
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:19,670
- I'll continue with the neighbours.

624
00:59:19,870 --> 00:59:21,400
- Keep surveying.

625
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:23,860
Right.

626
00:59:24,510 --> 00:59:26,450
Depending on the results of the survey,

627
00:59:26,650 --> 00:59:28,930
we'll focus on particular objects and tasks.

628
00:59:29,130 --> 00:59:31,560
We finish with you now
and to to the police department.

629
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:33,130
Your detective officer promised

630
00:59:33,330 --> 00:59:36,060
to help out with the security cam footage.

631
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:38,990
It's very important and it may help us a lot.

632
00:59:39,190 --> 00:59:40,230
Next.

633
00:59:40,430 --> 00:59:43,430
Since the night is coming,
the guy needs to sleep somewhere.

634
00:59:43,630 --> 00:59:45,110
It's not summer outside.

635
00:59:45,310 --> 00:59:46,790
We'll search the doorways.

636
00:59:47,730 --> 00:59:51,270
We'll ask the same officer for the door-codes,
hopefully he won't refuse.

637
00:59:51,730 --> 00:59:54,490
So. From the very beginning.

638
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:56,360
Alyosha Sleptsov.

639
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:57,660
12 years old,

640
00:59:57,860 --> 01:00:00,340
around 1 m 50 cm tall.

641
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:02,990
Healthy, no specific marks.

642
01:00:03,190 --> 01:00:04,210
Blond hair.

643
01:00:04,410 --> 01:00:07,730
was wearing blue jeans,
a red jacket with a hoodie,

644
01:00:07,930 --> 01:00:08,950
blue sneakers.

645
01:00:09,150 --> 01:00:11,890
Had a blue schoolbag.

646
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:17,110
Left the house yesterday, as usually.
Hasn't come back since, as it seems.

647
01:00:17,310 --> 01:00:20,450
The mobile phone is off
but we keep calling nevertheless.

648
01:00:22,050 --> 01:00:23,620
Got it. Next.

649
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:26,450
Tell me, what kind of hobbies does the boy have?

650
01:00:26,650 --> 01:00:30,260
Any sport clubs, maybe planning to go
building a spaceport,

651
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:31,890
traveling around the world and so on.

652
01:00:32,090 --> 01:00:35,260
- No, nothing like that,
doesn't do sports.

653
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:37,570
I think, he sits at home usually.

654
01:00:37,770 --> 01:00:39,370
- "You think"? I see.

655
01:00:39,570 --> 01:00:41,570
If so, then he has a computer?

656
01:00:42,130 --> 01:00:43,450
Is his laptop on the table?
- Yes.

657
01:00:43,650 --> 01:00:46,230
- Yeah, we're trying to limit the...
- Especially you do.

658
01:00:46,430 --> 01:00:50,400
- Look, you can discuss your relations later, okay?
- Yes, sorry.

659
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:52,700
- Have you got the access to the computer?
- Yes.

660
01:00:52,710 --> 01:00:55,820
- Get the access to his e-mail, to the accounts
in the social networks,

661
01:00:56,020 --> 01:00:58,880
addresses of his friends, girlfriends, buddies.

662
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:00,370
- He has only one friend.

663
01:01:00,850 --> 01:01:02,370
Kuznetsov, I think.

664
01:01:02,570 --> 01:01:04,170
- Mhm.

665
01:01:04,370 --> 01:01:06,170
"You think", again? Alright.

666
01:01:06,370 --> 01:01:08,270
- I have all his logins and passwords,

667
01:01:08,470 --> 01:01:10,370
he really has only one friend - Kuznetsov,

668
01:01:10,570 --> 01:01:12,810
in real life, I mean.

669
01:01:13,410 --> 01:01:15,880
In the social networks...
- Yeah, I got it.

670
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:19,230
Okay. The closest relatives where he could go to?

671
01:01:19,430 --> 01:01:22,210
Grannies, grandpas, uncles, ants, cousins?

672
01:01:22,410 --> 01:01:25,010
- My husband has none, I have a mother
she lives in the Moscow region.

673
01:01:25,210 --> 01:01:27,810
- We haven't been there for 3 years,
I don't think the brat remembers.

674
01:01:28,010 --> 01:01:30,090
- "The brat"? I see.

675
01:01:30,290 --> 01:01:33,450
I hope you called the granny
and she said he's not there?

676
01:01:33,650 --> 01:01:34,730
- No, I can't reach her.

677
01:01:34,930 --> 01:01:36,780
You know, our relations are very...

678
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:38,630
- What do you mean, you can't reach her?

679
01:01:38,830 --> 01:01:41,840
- She wasn't answering at first
then became out of reach.

680
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:42,840
The phone-line is quite bad there.

681
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:45,040
- The phone-line is good, the woman is quite insane.

682
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:48,340
- Mm. The granny with a spirit?
- Mhm.

683
01:01:48,540 --> 01:01:49,850
- Did you call the neighbours?

684
01:01:50,050 --> 01:01:51,160
- No, I have no phone number.

685
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:54,800
- It's her house, her area, the neighbours...

686
01:01:55,390 --> 01:01:57,950
It's better to stay away, or else...
- What if she's hiding

687
01:01:58,010 --> 01:02:01,130
that Alyosha is there,
if he asks her to do so, for example.

688
01:02:01,330 --> 01:02:02,550
- No, I don't think so.

689
01:02:02,940 --> 01:02:05,270
- She can do anything,
she's a female Stalin.

690
01:02:05,470 --> 01:02:06,340
- Enough!

691
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:08,370
We went there only by car,
How is he gonna get there?

692
01:02:08,570 --> 01:02:10,400
- What if she'd been secretly
communicating with him?

693
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:12,590
Ain't it possible?
- She doesn't love him!

694
01:02:12,690 --> 01:02:16,140
- Loves, doesn't love. She used him
as a tool against me.

695
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:19,000
- Look, we must go to your granny urgently.

696
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:20,450
Where exactly does she live?

697
01:02:20,650 --> 01:02:22,240
- In a summer house, all the time.

698
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:23,380
Kiev direction.

699
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:24,950
It's not easy to explain,

700
01:02:25,150 --> 01:02:27,150
there's a small side-road from the highway.

701
01:02:27,350 --> 01:02:28,880
- But you're with a car?
- Yes.

702
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:30,080
- How long till there?

703
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:32,720
- Around 3 hours, maybe 2,5.

704
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:34,110
- Here's what we do.

705
01:02:34,310 --> 01:02:36,660
You give me all the contacts
of his friends and fellows,

706
01:02:36,860 --> 01:02:39,440
including the phone of the head teacher.

707
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:41,240
I hope you have it?

708
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:44,200
- We do...
- Great, also all the logins and passwords.

709
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:49,290
I take the computer with me to the headquarters.
After that, we act according to the situation.

710
01:02:49,490 --> 01:02:52,490
Meanwhile you... Is it the head teacher's?

711
01:02:52,690 --> 01:02:53,910
Good.

712
01:02:54,110 --> 01:02:56,900
Meanwhile, you two jump into the car

713
01:02:57,100 --> 01:02:59,690
and head to your wonderful granny.

714
01:02:59,890 --> 01:03:02,690
Lena joins you, you saw her.
She's our experienced searcher.

715
01:03:02,890 --> 01:03:04,950
She'll be behind you, she has a car.

716
01:03:05,150 --> 01:03:07,850
On the way, try reaching the granny nevertheless.

717
01:03:07,970 --> 01:03:10,760
When you arrive, inspect everything carefully,
don't miss anything.

718
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:13,890
Report me the results immediately,
no matter what they are.

719
01:03:14,090 --> 01:03:15,110
Understood?
- Yes.

720
01:03:15,310 --> 01:03:16,720
- Will you manage?

721
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:18,330
Any questions?

722
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:22,950
We'll leave someone here at the flat,
in case the boy comes back.

723
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:25,850
So, shall we start?

724
01:03:26,050 --> 01:03:27,300
Let's go!

725
01:03:42,620 --> 01:03:44,050
- Damn you...

726
01:03:45,110 --> 01:03:46,920
Can you switch that off, my head aches!

727
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:48,920
- There's a pill in the glove compartment.

728
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:51,120
- Switch off! Please!

729
01:04:04,230 --> 01:04:06,160
You think he's at her place?

730
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:08,280
- Where else? Think about it.

731
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:18,160
What a mess has he made...

732
01:04:18,690 --> 01:04:20,110
Chose a good time, little shit.

733
01:04:20,310 --> 01:04:24,100
- What if something horrible happened to him?
- Let's not even think this way.

734
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:27,100
He's completely alright.

735
01:04:28,270 --> 01:04:31,270
Just wait, he'll get what he deserves.

736
01:04:32,860 --> 01:04:34,650
You can't smoke here.

737
01:04:34,850 --> 01:04:36,440
- How could I forget.

738
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:38,640
I'll smoke out of the window.
- I said don't!

739
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:43,020
- What will you do? Throw me onto the road?

740
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:46,130
- So, your head stopped aching, right?

741
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:48,990
- Raise the windows.

742
01:04:51,270 --> 01:04:53,470
Raise the windows!

743
01:04:56,940 --> 01:04:58,360
Bitch!

744
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:02,920
Raise the goddamned windows!

745
01:05:03,580 --> 01:05:05,280
AAA!

746
01:05:49,740 --> 01:05:50,860
- Wow.

747
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,280
They've put the gates.

748
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:55,780
What are we supposed to do?
To ram into them?

749
01:06:56,770 --> 01:06:58,890
She must be constructing barricades there.

750
01:06:59,090 --> 01:07:00,280
- Stop making a monster out of her.

751
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:01,990
- Is there another way in?

752
01:07:02,190 --> 01:07:03,700
- Except over the fence.

753
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:06,280
- We don't have the keys.

754
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:07,480
- Got it.

755
01:07:10,570 --> 01:07:11,590
- Where did she...

756
01:07:27,290 --> 01:07:28,260
- Thanks...

757
01:07:32,770 --> 01:07:33,610
- Mom!

758
01:07:37,050 --> 01:07:39,200
Mom, open up, it's me!

759
01:07:42,630 --> 01:07:43,810
Mom!

760
01:07:49,210 --> 01:07:50,110
Mom!

761
01:07:54,530 --> 01:07:56,110
- She's inside.

762
01:07:57,350 --> 01:08:00,700
- Mom, open up, Alyosha is missing.

763
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:04,700
- Dear Lord,

764
01:08:05,590 --> 01:08:07,530
Almost had a heart attack.

765
01:08:07,730 --> 01:08:08,940
First they call

766
01:08:09,140 --> 01:08:11,770
in the middle of the night,
like during a fire,

767
01:08:11,970 --> 01:08:13,770
then I see them climbing over the fence!

768
01:08:13,970 --> 01:08:16,290
Oh Lord, God save us all...

769
01:08:16,490 --> 01:08:18,620
That can drive anyone crazy!

770
01:08:18,820 --> 01:08:21,320
And most importantly,
I cannot find my phone.

771
01:08:24,310 --> 01:08:26,310
How can I survive!

772
01:08:27,870 --> 01:08:29,670
You could have warned, at least!

773
01:08:29,870 --> 01:08:32,430
- I kept calling all day, don't tell me you didn't hear.

774
01:08:32,630 --> 01:08:33,750
- I swear!

775
01:08:33,930 --> 01:08:35,720
- First, you didn't answer, then switched it off.

776
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:39,220
- I'm telling you, I don't know where it is!
Must have lost it somewhere.

777
01:08:39,420 --> 01:08:41,770
Cannot find it since morning. Well, screw it!

778
01:08:41,970 --> 01:08:44,270
You better tell me, my dear,

779
01:08:44,470 --> 01:08:47,130
why have you decided
that your kiddo is at my place, huh?

780
01:08:54,230 --> 01:08:56,790
- He's not here. Feels like he has never been.

781
01:08:56,990 --> 01:08:58,350
- We'll check everything.

782
01:09:19,070 --> 01:09:20,500
- Where is he wandering?

783
01:09:20,700 --> 01:09:23,360
Your goddamned dickwad. God bless us all...

784
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:25,360
You said you're divorcing, didn't you?

785
01:09:26,060 --> 01:09:28,220
- You curse and pray in the same package...

786
01:09:28,420 --> 01:09:31,160
- What? In what package?

787
01:09:32,270 --> 01:09:33,970
In what package?

788
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:36,170
What are you blabbering?!

789
01:09:36,690 --> 01:09:38,900
Are you completely nuts?

790
01:09:39,100 --> 01:09:40,700
Got so clever, huh?

791
01:09:40,900 --> 01:09:42,110
Don't shake your head to me!

792
01:09:42,310 --> 01:09:44,940
You're talking to you mother, by the way!
Have respect!

793
01:09:45,140 --> 01:09:47,260
And if you don't like something -
be off!

794
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:49,570
I didn't invite you here.

795
01:09:49,970 --> 01:09:51,540
Look at her...

796
01:09:51,740 --> 01:09:53,210
Why did I even give birth?.

797
01:09:53,410 --> 01:09:55,550
Just look at yourself: how do you look right now?

798
01:09:55,750 --> 01:09:57,770
- How?
- Like a wh*re!

799
01:09:57,970 --> 01:10:01,090
- Mom...
- Mom what? Want a breast? Here!

800
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:03,090
"Mommy, oh mommy"...

801
01:10:07,390 --> 01:10:10,370
Oh? Oh?

802
01:10:10,570 --> 01:10:13,430
What, searched everything? Not here?

803
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:16,440
How could you even think about this.

804
01:10:19,820 --> 01:10:21,820
No battery. Of course.

805
01:10:22,570 --> 01:10:25,180
Of course there's no battery, where was it?

806
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:27,330
- Was lying under you bed.

807
01:10:27,530 --> 01:10:29,370
- Must have fallen, then.

808
01:10:29,570 --> 01:10:31,420
Thank God, it was found.

809
01:10:32,210 --> 01:10:33,720
Well, let's have some tea, then.

810
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:36,030
Although I don't have anything sweet,
just the honey.

811
01:10:36,230 --> 01:10:38,360
Became all hard over time...
- No thanks, mom.

812
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:40,700
We'll go.
- Oh how polite she is, just look at her.

813
01:10:42,450 --> 01:10:45,210
You two don't even seem very upset.

814
01:10:45,410 --> 01:10:47,210
"Alyosha is missing!"

815
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:49,510
You're lying, aren't you?

816
01:10:49,710 --> 01:10:51,330
To make me sympathize?

817
01:10:51,530 --> 01:10:53,430
You chose the wrong person.

818
01:10:53,630 --> 01:10:55,530
I see right through you.

819
01:10:56,790 --> 01:10:58,490
You said you're divorcing.

820
01:10:58,690 --> 01:11:01,460
Decided to hand you b*stard to me?

821
01:11:01,660 --> 01:11:03,260
Seen this?

822
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:06,340
I told you back them and am telling right now:
I won't babysit him!

823
01:11:06,540 --> 01:11:07,590
- Do you even talk to anyone except the TV?

824
01:11:07,790 --> 01:11:10,600
- And when you were big-bellied,
do you remember what I was telling you?

825
01:11:10,790 --> 01:11:12,360
"Change you mind, dear, change your mind!"

826
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:15,370
And what did you tell me to do, remember?
Well, I remember.

827
01:11:15,570 --> 01:11:17,830
I told you you will come crawling to me

828
01:11:18,030 --> 01:11:20,300
but it will be too late. And here you go.

829
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:22,100
Now it's your problem.

830
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:25,470
A good lesson for you.
- Mom, what are you talking?

831
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:27,830
Have shame, there's a stranger in the room...

832
01:11:28,030 --> 01:11:29,910
- Don't teach me. Why did you start teaching me?

833
01:11:30,110 --> 01:11:32,850
Why should I be ashamed?
I'm in my house, by the way.

834
01:11:33,050 --> 01:11:35,610
Look at them! Trying to make a fool of me!

835
01:11:35,810 --> 01:11:37,610
Brought their asses in the middle of the night,

836
01:11:37,810 --> 01:11:41,360
just like thieves,
brought some valuator with them -

837
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:44,310
and I won't leave my house to you!

838
01:11:44,510 --> 01:11:46,890
Do you hear me? Don't even think about it!

839
01:11:47,090 --> 01:11:49,470
I'll give everything to God! That's it!

840
01:11:49,670 --> 01:11:50,780
I have nothing to offer to eat,

841
01:11:50,980 --> 01:11:52,810
all I have is a pension...
- Okay, let's go.

842
01:11:53,010 --> 01:11:54,610
- ...you don't even care about me...

843
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:56,770
- Okay, mom, we'll go.
- ...and I don't need your care!

844
01:11:56,970 --> 01:11:58,030
- Let's go...
- Oh dear Lord...

845
01:11:58,230 --> 01:12:00,650
Won't even come to my funerals...
- We'll come, worry not.

846
01:12:00,850 --> 01:12:01,740
F*ck you!

847
01:12:33,740 --> 01:12:35,740
- Where are we? Is there much left?

848
01:12:36,270 --> 01:12:38,180
- Around 40 minutes, I think.

849
01:12:44,180 --> 01:12:46,180
Her paranoia is only progressing with time...

850
01:12:47,750 --> 01:12:49,630
So much hate... It's crazy.

851
01:12:49,830 --> 01:12:51,700
- You think you're full of love?

852
01:12:52,420 --> 01:12:54,060
- Why do you defend her?

853
01:12:54,260 --> 01:12:56,690
- Cause she's right.
- In what?

854
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,470
In saying that you can't wait till she dies?

855
01:12:59,670 --> 01:13:01,470
- Watch your tongue.

856
01:13:05,470 --> 01:13:07,860
She's right in saying
that I shouldn't get involved with you,

857
01:13:08,060 --> 01:13:10,130
shouldn't give birth, shouldn't be so foolish.

858
01:13:10,970 --> 01:13:13,880
But I listened to you.

859
01:13:15,370 --> 01:13:18,210
"Everything's fine, we're together"
Explain to me now,

860
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:21,560
how did it happen that you were promising love

861
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:23,360
and happiness,

862
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:26,310
and as a result I've had
only pain and disappointment.

863
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,610
Impenetrable ass full of shit.

864
01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:45,860
I never even loved you.

865
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:51,330
I just couldn't live with her any longer.

866
01:13:56,340 --> 01:13:58,550
And couldn't get unstuck from her either.

867
01:14:00,020 --> 01:14:02,570
I could with you.

868
01:14:04,910 --> 01:14:06,910
I used you.

869
01:14:07,650 --> 01:14:09,220
As I thought.

870
01:14:09,420 --> 01:14:11,360
In reality, you used me.

871
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:13,310
You needed a family, not I.

872
01:14:13,510 --> 01:14:15,920
I could have managed without it, really.

873
01:14:20,900 --> 01:14:23,630
I just should have start
to live on my own somewhere.

874
01:14:26,850 --> 01:14:29,110
But I got pregnant.

875
01:14:31,110 --> 01:14:33,110
That's when I got depressed.

876
01:14:36,170 --> 01:14:38,770
I shouldn't have listened to you,
should have made an abortion.

877
01:14:38,970 --> 01:14:39,470
- Yeah, you should have.

878
01:14:39,670 --> 01:14:41,960
It would have been better for all of us.

879
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:44,450
- Oh really? And what would have changed?

880
01:14:44,650 --> 01:14:46,250
Would you have changed?

881
01:14:46,450 --> 01:14:49,770
Haven't you made big-bellied another young fool,
with pulling her into your hell?

882
01:14:50,730 --> 01:14:52,340
In 10-12 years, if you still get a boner,

883
01:14:52,540 --> 01:14:54,940
you'll perform this trick once more, I'm sure.

884
01:14:57,360 --> 01:14:59,840
Poor girl, I even pity her.

885
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:06,960
You ruined my life, do you get this?

886
01:15:12,530 --> 01:15:14,390
Thank God, I met a decent man,

887
01:15:14,590 --> 01:15:16,450
who doesn't need anything from me,

888
01:15:16,650 --> 01:15:18,450
except for me myself.

889
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:23,350
What happened? We broke down?
- Yeah, we broke down.

890
01:15:23,550 --> 01:15:25,210
- Get out.
- No, seriously.

891
01:15:25,410 --> 01:15:27,070
- I'm serious. Get the f*ck out!

892
01:15:29,070 --> 01:15:31,480
Get out while I didn't kick you out with my legs.

893
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:34,090
- Go on, what else haven't you done with me, ***!

894
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:37,870
Don't forget that your son got missing, jerk!

895
01:18:04,230 --> 01:18:05,860
- Let's keep the line!

896
01:18:07,230 --> 01:18:08,650
Stay close!

897
01:18:15,690 --> 01:18:17,690
- Fox 1, doing the calling.

898
01:18:19,850 --> 01:18:27,060
Aaa-lyooo-shaaa!

899
01:18:32,090 --> 01:18:39,070
Aaa-lyooo-shaaa!

900
01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:49,450
Aaa-lyooo-shaaa!

901
01:18:57,450 --> 01:18:59,450
Fox 1, the calling finished.

902
01:18:59,650 --> 01:19:01,450
Let's go, guys.

903
01:19:54,990 --> 01:19:56,470
- This is it.

904
01:19:56,990 --> 01:19:58,990
- Can you do it one more time?

905
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:04,130
- He's not there on the other cameras.

906
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:06,840
Neither on the way to school, not to the mall,

907
01:20:06,870 --> 01:20:08,730
to which they all go
as if there's a magnet there.

908
01:20:08,930 --> 01:20:10,570
- Well, there's food and it looks nice.

909
01:20:10,770 --> 01:20:13,360
- not on the way to the bus or the route-taxi.

910
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:17,940
If he wanted to go towards the metro
and then to the train station, for example,

911
01:20:18,140 --> 01:20:19,940
the options are:

912
01:20:21,250 --> 01:20:23,790
either he turned
where there are no street cameras -

913
01:20:23,990 --> 01:20:25,590
and there are a lot of such places -

914
01:20:25,790 --> 01:20:28,760
or he chose to walk so that he avoids them,

915
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:30,760
which is unlikely.

916
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:32,760
Or he was taken.

917
01:20:33,110 --> 01:20:34,820
- What do you mean, taken?

918
01:20:35,820 --> 01:20:37,470
- Kidnapped.

919
01:20:39,460 --> 01:20:41,460
- Are you serious?.

920
01:20:42,170 --> 01:20:44,240
- You don't joke about such things.

921
01:20:46,240 --> 01:20:48,040
- It is impossible.

922
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:50,950
- Unfortunately, sometimes it is.
And what do you have?

923
01:20:52,790 --> 01:20:55,380
- Yesterday's survey was useless.

924
01:20:55,580 --> 01:20:57,780
It took a long time, according to us.

925
01:20:57,980 --> 01:21:00,170
You should initiate a investigating case.

926
01:21:00,620 --> 01:21:03,420
Maybe even a criminal one.
- Excuse me.

927
01:21:03,950 --> 01:21:07,600
- We handed out the posters,
to emergencies and shops,

928
01:21:07,720 --> 01:21:10,000
to the kiosks...
- Hello?

929
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:11,780
- Darling, I missed you.

930
01:21:11,980 --> 01:21:13,780
Will you come tonight? You promised.

931
01:21:13,980 --> 01:21:16,210
- I don't think so, I must take part in the search.

932
01:21:16,410 --> 01:21:17,270
- And what about me?

933
01:21:17,470 --> 01:21:19,840
What about your work? You said it's so strict there...

934
01:21:19,900 --> 01:21:21,470
- I took a day off.

935
01:21:22,730 --> 01:21:24,730
- And a day off of me, too?

936
01:21:24,930 --> 01:21:26,730
- Don't be ridiculous.

937
01:21:27,710 --> 01:21:29,800
You perfectly understand everything.

938
01:21:30,660 --> 01:21:32,380
- I just feel so lonely.

939
01:21:32,580 --> 01:21:34,100
You're there, I'm here...

940
01:21:34,300 --> 01:21:35,930
It won't be always like this, will it?

941
01:21:36,130 --> 01:21:37,140
- Sure it won't.

942
01:21:37,590 --> 01:21:39,520
Okay, goodbye, I really have to go.

943
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:40,850
- No, wait, wait!

944
01:21:41,050 --> 01:21:43,850
Don't hang up, I want to listen
to what you're doing there.

945
01:21:44,540 --> 01:21:47,050
- What are you talking about?

946
01:21:47,980 --> 01:21:49,720
It's not appropriate.

947
01:21:50,330 --> 01:21:51,720
- Why?

948
01:21:52,620 --> 01:21:54,430
Are you hiding something?

949
01:21:54,610 --> 01:21:56,730
- Of course, not.

950
01:21:58,730 --> 01:22:00,770
- You're definitely hiding something.

951
01:22:00,970 --> 01:22:02,340
Is your ex also there?

952
01:22:03,540 --> 01:22:04,140
- Masha,

953
01:22:04,340 --> 01:22:06,340
don't be silly.

954
01:22:07,370 --> 01:22:09,260
I love you.

955
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:11,200
- Really?

956
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:12,640
- Of course.

957
01:22:13,460 --> 01:22:15,080
- I love you, too.

958
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:17,750
We love you.
- Okay, bye.

959
01:22:17,850 --> 01:22:21,050
- Bye. Kiss you and I'm waiting for you!

960
01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:26,780
- Oh, oh, how gentle she is, like a kitty!.
- Mom...

961
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:29,780
Let me do things myself, okay?

962
01:22:29,980 --> 01:22:32,640
- Sure, for God's sake!

963
01:22:33,300 --> 01:22:34,910
Of course, you do it yourself.

964
01:22:35,860 --> 01:22:39,190
It's just that my mother taught me
and I taught you:

965
01:22:39,670 --> 01:22:41,860
Those men, Masha, you know,

966
01:22:42,060 --> 01:22:43,640
are like babies.

967
01:22:45,670 --> 01:22:48,930
You're such a beauty, my dear!

968
01:22:51,110 --> 01:22:54,500
Check this one, I showed you as you walked by,
you didn't even notice.

969
01:22:54,700 --> 01:22:55,440
- Mm, no...

970
01:22:55,780 --> 01:22:57,100
- Hi, dad.

971
01:22:57,400 --> 01:22:59,400
- Hello, my dear.

972
01:23:00,820 --> 01:23:03,610
- So, how are you?

973
01:23:03,810 --> 01:23:05,000
- Fine.

974
01:23:05,610 --> 01:23:07,610
Autumn.

975
01:23:08,180 --> 01:23:10,630
- And we're having summer,
by the way, all the year.

976
01:23:11,330 --> 01:23:13,230
- Are you coming to Moscow some time?

977
01:23:13,430 --> 01:23:15,730
- What will I do there?

978
01:23:17,020 --> 01:23:19,350
- Well, to see me.

979
01:23:19,550 --> 01:23:21,890
- I see you right now.

980
01:23:23,700 --> 01:23:25,400
Obrigado.

981
01:23:30,350 --> 01:23:31,890
Okay, dad,

982
01:23:32,550 --> 01:23:35,660
I have to go, I have a meeting, I told you.

983
01:23:36,290 --> 01:23:39,120
Don't feel sad without me, please!

984
01:23:39,470 --> 01:23:42,600
I kiss you so so so much!

985
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:45,670
- Okay, bye, I kiss you.

986
01:23:45,870 --> 01:23:48,730
- Kiss you! Bye bye bye!

987
01:24:43,450 --> 01:24:45,140
- Get up.

988
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:47,470
It's time to go.

989
01:24:54,660 --> 01:24:56,300
- What's the time?

990
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:02,880
- Look, I'll go with you, if it's okay.

991
01:25:03,470 --> 01:25:04,680
- Yeah, sure.

992
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:07,680
Don't you need to go to work?
- The work will wait.

993
01:25:08,140 --> 01:25:08,850
- Right.

994
01:25:10,850 --> 01:25:12,850
I need to call that, what's his name,

995
01:25:13,370 --> 01:25:14,810
the coordinator.

996
01:25:15,010 --> 01:25:17,530
God, how late it is. I did set the alarm clock...

997
01:25:17,730 --> 01:25:19,300
- I switched it off,

998
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:21,080
you had to rest.

999
01:25:29,650 --> 01:25:30,740
- Listening.

1000
01:25:30,940 --> 01:25:32,740
- Hello, Ivan?
- Yes.

1001
01:25:32,940 --> 01:25:34,940
- Hello, this is Alyosha Sleptsov's mother.

1002
01:25:35,140 --> 01:25:36,740
- Yeah, do you have some news?

1003
01:25:36,940 --> 01:25:40,450
- No, do you?
- Haven't found yet, we keep working.

1004
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,220
- Okay.
- Something else?

1005
01:25:45,820 --> 01:25:48,050
- You see, I came back very late yesterday,

1006
01:25:48,250 --> 01:25:51,050
so I couldn't...
- I'm sorry, I have absolutely no time right now,

1007
01:25:51,250 --> 01:25:53,050
I'm sorry.

1008
01:25:53,260 --> 01:25:54,960
- Yes, yes, I understand, just tell me

1009
01:25:55,160 --> 01:25:56,300
what I can do.

1010
01:25:56,500 --> 01:25:58,300
I cannot just sit here and wait
- Take the phone

1011
01:25:58,500 --> 01:26:02,200
and start calling all the hospitals in the district,
without exceptions.

1012
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:03,990
Any unidentified boy aged 10-13,

1013
01:26:04,190 --> 01:26:05,590
brought by the police or ambulance,

1014
01:26:05,790 --> 01:26:08,970
no matter if he fits the description,
is our case

1015
01:26:09,170 --> 01:26:10,970
and must be visually checked.

1016
01:26:11,390 --> 01:26:14,300
If you find one,
inform me immediately,

1017
01:26:14,550 --> 01:26:17,360
preferably by SMS. I'll send a group there.

1018
01:26:17,730 --> 01:26:19,540
- We can go there ourselves, we have a car.

1019
01:26:19,590 --> 01:26:20,890
- Great. But inform me nevertheless.

1020
01:26:21,090 --> 01:26:24,990
In any case, there will be and experienced searcher
who knows how to behave in this situation.

1021
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:28,410
If there are multiple cases,
it's better is there are

1022
01:26:28,610 --> 01:26:32,440
more that one group.
That's it, I cannot talk anymore, we'll be in touch.

1023
01:26:51,900 --> 01:26:53,440
When did you see him last?

1024
01:26:53,590 --> 01:26:55,860
- Well, two days before yesterday, I think.

1025
01:26:56,460 --> 01:26:58,000
- On the 9th?

1026
01:26:58,200 --> 01:26:59,870
On Tuesday?

1027
01:27:00,070 --> 01:27:01,730
- Yeah.
- Where?

1028
01:27:02,280 --> 01:27:03,820
- Here, at school.

1029
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:07,730
- And what did you do after school?

1030
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:10,610
- Nothing, we went home.

1031
01:27:12,860 --> 01:27:14,790
- And where do you hang out usually?

1032
01:27:15,460 --> 01:27:17,110
- In the courtyard, I don't know.

1033
01:27:17,310 --> 01:27:19,310
- Okay, in the courtyard, and where else?

1034
01:27:20,020 --> 01:27:21,820
- Nowhere.

1035
01:27:21,860 --> 01:27:23,480
- Oh come on.

1036
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:25,680
In the mall, probably?

1037
01:27:26,090 --> 01:27:28,540
- No, our parents don't let us go there.

1038
01:27:28,630 --> 01:27:32,040
- Are you some babies? Do you stay in the courtyard?
Playing in a sand-box, or something?

1039
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:35,700
- Why babies? We play football
on a hockey playground.

1040
01:27:38,140 --> 01:27:40,040
- And do you have a bike?

1041
01:27:40,240 --> 01:27:42,040
- Yes.

1042
01:27:42,530 --> 01:27:45,270
- So, where do you usually go to with Alyosha?

1043
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:46,950
- Well, nowhere.

1044
01:27:47,150 --> 01:27:49,150
In the block, around the buildings.

1045
01:27:49,350 --> 01:27:50,640
- Look, young man.

1046
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:53,750
If you know where he is
but you're not telling because he asked you -

1047
01:27:53,950 --> 01:27:55,550
fine, don't tell.

1048
01:27:55,750 --> 01:27:57,550
I understand it, really.

1049
01:27:57,750 --> 01:28:01,390
The main thing is that you are sure
that you friend is safe, alive and well.

1050
01:28:01,490 --> 01:28:05,300
We are the grown-ups,
we'll run, we'll search, it's not a problem.

1051
01:28:05,620 --> 01:28:08,080
Just like the hide-and-seek, right?

1052
01:28:08,450 --> 01:28:10,120
Do you play a game with us?

1053
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:12,320
- I really don't know where he is.

1054
01:28:15,910 --> 01:28:17,840
- Okay, I believe you.

1055
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:21,220
And where can he be?

1056
01:28:22,290 --> 01:28:24,900
I know, you have a camp.

1057
01:28:26,100 --> 01:28:28,860
To be honest, I don't know where it is,
but I really know that it exists.

1058
01:28:28,900 --> 01:28:31,200
You chatted about it on VKontakte.

1059
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:35,830
If you really don't know where Alyosha is,
but you assume he could be there,

1060
01:28:36,030 --> 01:28:39,010
you have to tell us where this place is.

1061
01:28:39,860 --> 01:28:43,080
Because you friend might be in danger now.

1062
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:51,480
Look, bro, we'll find him anyway.

1063
01:28:52,180 --> 01:28:54,590
But it can be too late, and it will be sad.

1064
01:28:55,460 --> 01:28:58,190
What's more important for you,
a friend or some place?

1065
01:28:58,240 --> 01:29:00,690
You'll find plenty of other places like that!

1066
01:29:00,890 --> 01:29:01,550
And if you gave some oath,

1067
01:29:01,750 --> 01:29:03,380
believe me, you aren't breaking it now,

1068
01:29:03,580 --> 01:29:05,040
because you're saving your friend,

1069
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:06,710
and he really needs your help.

1070
01:29:08,710 --> 01:29:10,710
- It's in the forest,

1071
01:29:10,910 --> 01:29:11,620
the camp.

1072
01:29:11,940 --> 01:29:13,280
- Okay, good.

1073
01:29:13,480 --> 01:29:15,620
What is it? A dugout? A hut?

1074
01:29:15,820 --> 01:29:17,970
- No, it's an abandoned building.

1075
01:29:18,170 --> 01:29:19,770
It's in the basement.

1076
01:29:19,970 --> 01:29:21,960
- Is it better to go there on foot or by bike?

1077
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,740
- It quite far, better by bike.

1078
01:29:25,940 --> 01:29:27,320
- Will you show?

1079
01:29:31,320 --> 01:29:33,510
You helped us a lot, thank you.

1080
01:29:34,240 --> 01:29:36,700
The boy of yours is a fine fellow.

1081
01:29:37,150 --> 01:29:39,180
Tell me, do you have some more time?

1082
01:29:39,380 --> 01:29:40,000
- Yes, I do.

1083
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:42,750
- Good. Will you go with us?
Would you help?

1084
01:29:42,950 --> 01:29:43,880
- Okay.

1085
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:46,080
- Thank you, good bye!
- Good bye!

1086
01:30:12,550 --> 01:30:13,680
- So? Shall we go?

1087
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:15,010
- Yeah, let's go.

1088
01:30:17,010 --> 01:30:18,010
One moment.

1089
01:31:55,010 --> 01:31:56,190
- It's there.

1090
01:32:34,050 --> 01:32:35,660
- That's his jacket.

1091
01:32:42,180 --> 01:32:43,640
- Grandpa Pihto to Ivan, over.

1092
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:46,840
We found a jacket, the father is sure it's his.
How copy?

1093
01:32:47,750 --> 01:32:48,420
- Acknowledged.

1094
01:32:48,620 --> 01:32:51,660
In this case we search
all the complex of buildings and surroundings.

1095
01:32:52,030 --> 01:32:52,650
I remind:

1096
01:32:52,850 --> 01:32:54,970
Mark dangerous, strange places

1097
01:32:55,170 --> 01:32:58,210
inform about them but don't go inside.

1098
01:32:58,410 --> 01:33:00,210
There are professionals for that.

1099
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:02,430
Don't increase the suffering, don't get hurt.

1100
01:33:02,630 --> 01:33:05,970
If something like this happens
we stop the search

1101
01:33:06,170 --> 01:33:09,500
and focus our efforts
on helping the partner.

1102
01:33:09,620 --> 01:33:12,380
First, contact the coordinator,
that is, me.

1103
01:33:12,580 --> 01:33:16,110
Medical assistance is provided
by the doctor only. He's there.

1104
01:33:16,310 --> 01:33:17,910
Until he comes,

1105
01:33:18,110 --> 01:33:20,620
the "runner", in case he's physically restrained,

1106
01:33:20,820 --> 01:33:22,620
stays untouched, we talk to him,

1107
01:33:22,820 --> 01:33:24,180
we comfort him verbally,

1108
01:33:24,380 --> 01:33:25,740
wait for the doctor.

1109
01:33:26,070 --> 01:33:27,460
Okay, let's race.

1110
01:33:27,660 --> 01:33:30,210
The race is a metaphor, don't take it literally.

1111
01:33:30,410 --> 01:33:32,210
Okay, let's go!

1112
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:36,900
- Dawn to Ivan.

1113
01:34:37,100 --> 01:34:39,990
First floor and basement checked.

1114
01:34:40,190 --> 01:34:42,790
What are the further actions? How copy?

1115
01:34:44,020 --> 01:34:45,360
- Acknowledged, Dawn. Roger that.

1116
01:34:45,560 --> 01:34:47,810
You can help Fox 1 in the neighbour building.

1117
01:34:48,010 --> 01:34:48,780
Over.

1118
01:34:49,200 --> 01:34:51,200
- Acknowledged. Roger.

1119
01:36:04,750 --> 01:36:06,300
- Granpda Pihto to Ivan.

1120
01:36:06,500 --> 01:36:09,570
Roof and all rooms of the 2nd floor examined.

1121
01:36:09,830 --> 01:36:10,890
No traces.

1122
01:36:11,830 --> 01:36:13,090
How copy? Over.

1123
01:36:13,830 --> 01:36:15,600
- Acknowledged. Message for everybody.

1124
01:36:15,800 --> 01:36:17,360
Object closed, the both buildings.

1125
01:36:17,560 --> 01:36:20,190
The boy's not found, we search the forest next.

1126
01:36:50,190 --> 01:36:51,650
- Hello.
- Hello.

1127
01:36:51,850 --> 01:36:53,170
- We need you help.
- Listening.

1128
01:36:53,330 --> 01:36:55,830
- We're from the search-and-rescue squad,
we're looking for a boy,

1129
01:36:56,030 --> 01:36:58,070
Alyosha Sleptsov, 12 years old, this is his mother.

1130
01:36:58,270 --> 01:37:01,060
He ran away and could have called himself
by different name.

1131
01:37:01,260 --> 01:37:04,050
We know that you received a boy
who fits the description.

1132
01:37:04,250 --> 01:37:05,570
Can we see him?

1133
01:37:06,770 --> 01:37:08,960
- You two, take a seat here, please.

1134
01:37:09,160 --> 01:37:10,380
And you go with me.

1135
01:37:11,340 --> 01:37:12,410
- Is he okay?

1136
01:37:12,610 --> 01:37:15,190
- He's fine, just tired and scared.

1137
01:37:15,390 --> 01:37:15,770
- Scared by what?

1138
01:37:15,970 --> 01:37:18,470
- Well, the police picked him up in the street
yesterday at night.

1139
01:37:18,670 --> 01:37:21,340
They kept him till the morning somewhere,
then brought here.

1140
01:37:21,540 --> 01:37:24,210
- How could they do that? They know about him,
I filed a report.

1141
01:37:24,410 --> 01:37:25,600
- They know nothing.

1142
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:27,800
Another shift came, that's it.

1143
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:29,800
Some strange kid,

1144
01:37:30,180 --> 01:37:32,300
who says nothing. They took him to the hospital.

1145
01:37:32,500 --> 01:37:34,300
A usual procedure.

1146
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:38,410
Come in.

1147
01:37:40,160 --> 01:37:42,850
Hey... Wake up.

1148
01:38:21,310 --> 01:38:23,240
- Don't rush!

1149
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:25,040
Keep up!

1150
01:38:25,240 --> 01:38:27,240
Maintain the visual contact.

1151
01:38:27,860 --> 01:38:29,920
Keep together.

1152
01:39:00,630 --> 01:39:02,630
- No, we didn't see him here.

1153
01:39:02,910 --> 01:39:06,160
You cannot get to the territory
without a pass or a special permit.

1154
01:39:06,360 --> 01:39:07,060
It's a secure area.

1155
01:39:07,120 --> 01:39:08,800
- May I leave the posters?

1156
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,990
Maybe the other shift saw him?

1157
01:39:11,190 --> 01:39:13,180
- No problem.
- Thanks a lot.

1158
01:39:13,770 --> 01:39:14,890
- Thank you!

1159
01:39:26,990 --> 01:39:29,330
- Fox 1, doing the calling.

1160
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:37,170
Aaa-lyooo-shaaa!

1161
01:39:45,540 --> 01:39:51,470
Aaa-lyooo-shaaa!

1162
01:39:57,870 --> 01:40:04,250
Aaa-lyooo-shaaa!

1163
01:40:11,950 --> 01:40:13,690
- Grandpa Pihto to Ivan.

1164
01:40:13,950 --> 01:40:15,980
Came to the river. No traces.

1165
01:40:16,180 --> 01:40:17,050
How copy?

1166
01:40:17,250 --> 01:40:19,380
- Acknowledged. Come back.

1167
01:40:19,580 --> 01:40:22,520
- Roger.
- What about in the river?

1168
01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:24,320
- We don't look for the dead.

1169
01:40:24,520 --> 01:40:27,440
It's done by the police or the Extreme Measures,
if there are reasons.

1170
01:40:27,640 --> 01:40:29,810
Crew! Go back!

1171
01:40:30,010 --> 01:40:32,010
Return to the base.

1172
01:40:32,720 --> 01:40:34,500
- Fox 1, we're going back.

1173
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:42,640
- With regard to the absence of a positive result

1174
01:40:42,780 --> 01:40:45,580
in the search of a "runner" and
a sharp worsening of weather conditions

1175
01:40:45,780 --> 01:40:49,360
I make a decision
to change the status of the search.

1176
01:40:49,560 --> 01:40:51,720
We start an intense informing of the public

1177
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:53,520
about a child gone missing.

1178
01:40:53,720 --> 01:40:57,040
We start the total poster put-up:

1179
01:40:57,240 --> 01:41:00,560
bus stops, underground crossings,

1180
01:41:00,760 --> 01:41:02,790
doorways, light poles,

1181
01:41:02,990 --> 01:41:05,370
benches, information boards,

1182
01:41:05,570 --> 01:41:09,540
fences, shops if there's permission
of the administrator.

1183
01:41:09,740 --> 01:41:10,970
As usually.

1184
01:41:11,540 --> 01:41:13,960
Now, I need 2 groups of 5 people

1185
01:41:14,160 --> 01:41:15,960
to check the doorways.

1186
01:41:17,390 --> 01:41:19,170
Great, we'll sort it out.

1187
01:41:19,370 --> 01:41:21,150
The others get on the put-up.

1188
01:41:21,330 --> 01:41:22,430
Okay, let's go!

1189
01:41:22,910 --> 01:41:24,910
- The descriptions are here.

1190
01:41:27,210 --> 01:41:27,910
- Thanks.

1191
01:41:53,190 --> 01:41:57,590
- Dawn to Ivan. The elevator stopped
at the 3rd floor. How copy?

1192
01:41:57,940 --> 01:42:00,220
- Acknowledged. We wait.

1193
01:42:04,480 --> 01:42:06,430
- It's going down.

1194
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:29,190
- Oh. Good evening.
- Howdy...

1195
01:42:31,870 --> 01:42:34,020
- Dawn to Ivan. It's not him.

1196
01:42:34,460 --> 01:42:37,440
- Acknowledged. Keep the surveillance.

1197
01:42:39,790 --> 01:42:41,750
- Young man...
- Let's go...

1198
01:42:41,950 --> 01:42:45,590
- ...are you?
- Excuse us, please...

1199
01:42:46,390 --> 01:42:47,710
You silly.

1200
01:42:51,570 --> 01:42:53,410
- I almost fixed your love life...

1201
01:42:53,550 --> 01:42:54,810
- Yeah, right.

1202
01:42:55,050 --> 01:42:56,510
- Wow, the "green fellows"...

1203
01:42:57,310 --> 01:42:59,830
From what planet are you, boys?.

1204
01:43:00,030 --> 01:43:01,510
- Young lady, please, go.

1205
01:43:02,690 --> 01:43:04,210
- How polite!

1206
01:50:17,780 --> 01:50:19,360
- Wait here.

1207
01:50:27,960 --> 01:50:29,460
Hello!

1208
01:50:30,340 --> 01:50:32,340
Here we are.

1209
01:50:57,710 --> 01:50:59,250
Anton, can you...

1210
01:51:15,860 --> 01:51:16,980
It'll be hard.

1211
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:22,280
- I am ready.

1212
01:51:51,960 --> 01:51:53,730
It's not him...

1213
01:51:56,880 --> 01:51:59,200
Alyosha had a birthmark here, on the chest...

A birthmark, on a chest...

Not him...

1216
01:52:06,050 --> 01:52:08,050
- Are you sure?.

1217
01:52:09,360 --> 01:52:11,520
No, no, it's not him...

1218
01:52:13,870 --> 01:52:16,350
These hands and fingers...

1219
01:52:16,550 --> 01:52:19,290
Hair, everything... No, it's not him...

1220
01:52:26,040 --> 01:52:28,670
Please, take him away...

1221
01:52:29,860 --> 01:52:31,950
Please, take away...

1222
01:52:39,370 --> 01:52:40,910
- In fact, we should perform

1223
01:52:41,110 --> 01:52:43,740
a comparative DNA analysis
so that we're sure that...

1224
01:52:43,940 --> 01:52:45,540
- It's not him, isn't it clear?

1225
01:52:45,740 --> 01:52:48,630
- You know, sometimes people
just refuse to believe that...

1226
01:52:48,830 --> 01:52:50,270
- It's not him, how many times
must I repeat?

1227
01:52:50,470 --> 01:52:52,270
- Listen to me,

1228
01:52:52,370 --> 01:52:54,430
this analysis can be done only by you.

The cops haven't initiated a case yet,
they'll drag it...

- God, you must be kidding me You don't here me?
It's not him, how many times must I repeat?

1231
01:53:00,620 --> 01:53:03,050
I'm talking to you in plain Russian - it's not him!

Why are you silent?

- Zhenya!
- I would have never given him away!

You hear me, bastard?
- Zhenya!

- I would have never given him to anybody!

Generally speaking, she likes this option.

- Mhm.

Have you talked to him?

01:56:41,090 --> 01:56:43,940
- I have. He said he'll think.

1248

- There's nothing to think about.

1249

A great option, I think.
