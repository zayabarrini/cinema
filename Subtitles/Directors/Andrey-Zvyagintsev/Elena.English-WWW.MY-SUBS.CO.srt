ELENA

7
00:06:39,668 --> 00:06:40,959
Get up.

8
00:08:32,084 --> 00:08:34,293
- Good morning.
- Morning.

9
00:08:47,501 --> 00:08:51,543
<i>If they don't look after themselves,
they'll pile on weight</i>

10
00:08:51,626 --> 00:08:55,584
<i>and have lots of other
illnesses to deal with.</i>

11
00:08:56,116 --> 00:09:01,709
<i>That's why you must take
a good hard look at your lifestyle.</i>

12
00:09:01,793 --> 00:09:06,793
<i>Adjust your tastes.</i>

13
00:09:06,876 --> 00:09:12,043
<i>The easy way to eat
healthily is to eat salads!</i>

14
00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:38,459
Bon appétit.

15
00:09:41,334 --> 00:09:43,168
The porridge is perfect.

16
00:09:58,126 --> 00:10:00,001
What have you
got planned today?

17
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:05,459
I've got to go and pick up my pension,
then I'm going to see Sergei.

18
00:10:07,501 --> 00:10:08,959
He should be coming here.

19
00:10:09,043 --> 00:10:12,168
He needs the money, not you.

20
00:10:13,418 --> 00:10:15,334
It's not about the money.

21
00:10:15,418 --> 00:10:17,543
That's exactly
what it's about.

22
00:10:17,626 --> 00:10:19,876
Why are you always
traipsing over there?

23
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:23,584
He should drag himself over here.
He's a big boy.

24
00:10:24,626 --> 00:10:29,293
Just drop it. I don't tell you
how to treat your daughter.

25
00:10:29,376 --> 00:10:31,084
It's dropped.

26
00:10:33,334 --> 00:10:36,126
- I hope you're not staying over.
- No.

27
00:10:55,959 --> 00:10:57,668
Good morning.

28
00:11:00,084 --> 00:11:01,209
Hello.

29
00:11:38,709 --> 00:11:41,001
- Goodbye.
- Thank you.

30
00:11:53,709 --> 00:11:54,751
Goodbye.

31
00:12:53,918 --> 00:12:55,709
Good afternoon!

32
00:12:55,876 --> 00:13:00,251
Today we've got
a fine selection

33
00:13:00,418 --> 00:13:03,959
of glossy magazines for the
lovely ladies, crosswords,

34
00:13:04,084 --> 00:13:07,918
adult magazines
and today's papers.

35
00:13:08,001 --> 00:13:10,251
Just stop me as I come by.

36
00:13:58,376 --> 00:14:00,334
1,425 roubles.

37
00:14:10,418 --> 00:14:13,293
Nadya! Come and
take care of this.

38
00:14:41,043 --> 00:14:42,751
- Hello.
- Hello.

39
00:14:46,168 --> 00:14:47,876
What is that shit?

40
00:14:49,543 --> 00:14:51,459
Let's go and have a beer.

41
00:14:51,543 --> 00:14:53,001
Is it your round?

42
00:14:53,084 --> 00:14:54,084
No.

43
00:15:57,876 --> 00:16:00,168
Is someone gonna get that?

44
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:02,459
Sasha!

45
00:16:04,043 --> 00:16:06,084
Are you deaf?

46
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:09,834
Alright already!

47
00:16:14,668 --> 00:16:16,584
Oh, Sasha.

48
00:16:16,668 --> 00:16:17,626
- Hi.
- Hi.

49
00:16:17,709 --> 00:16:21,376
Where are you going?
Put these in the kitchen.

50
00:16:50,126 --> 00:16:52,168
- Hi, Ma. Come on in.
- Hey.

51
00:17:04,626 --> 00:17:06,043
You need a trim!

52
00:17:09,251 --> 00:17:12,251
Right.
Here's the money.

53
00:17:13,293 --> 00:17:14,376
Thanks.

54
00:17:20,918 --> 00:17:23,168
Here he comes,
here he comes!

55
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:25,876
Oh, look who's here!

56
00:17:28,668 --> 00:17:30,418
Tanya,
I brought some money.

57
00:17:30,501 --> 00:17:32,793
Thank you,
Elena Anatolievna.

58
00:17:32,876 --> 00:17:33,918
Give it here.

59
00:17:42,918 --> 00:17:44,959
I can't see through you,
woman.

60
00:17:48,418 --> 00:17:51,126
- Tanya, put the kettle on.
- Yes.

61
00:17:51,209 --> 00:17:53,959
- Where are you off to?
- Vitya needs his CDs.

62
00:17:54,043 --> 00:17:56,043
Your Vitya isn't
going anywhere.

63
00:17:56,126 --> 00:17:58,584
- I'll just be a sec.
- I know you mean by "a sec".

64
00:17:58,668 --> 00:18:00,376
He needs these CDs now.

65
00:18:00,459 --> 00:18:04,001
You two are going to wind up
in prison or the army.

66
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:06,334
I can't just sit
here like an idiot.

67
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,209
Then don't act like one.

68
00:18:08,293 --> 00:18:11,459
- Don't you care about your future?
- OK, back off!

69
00:18:11,543 --> 00:18:15,126
I won't back off!
Take out the rubbish.

70
00:18:17,501 --> 00:18:18,793
Whatever!

71
00:18:18,876 --> 00:18:21,376
- Whatever?
- Nothing.

72
00:18:21,459 --> 00:18:23,668
- What did I say?
- Nothing.

73
00:18:23,751 --> 00:18:26,959
Go and have a cup of tea
with your grandmother.

74
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:49,959
How am I supposed
to talk to him?

75
00:18:52,709 --> 00:18:55,209
- I'm at my wits' end.
- I'll talk to him.

76
00:19:04,834 --> 00:19:07,626
Coming, Dad.
Can't get past this stupid level!

77
00:19:12,126 --> 00:19:13,751
Just a sec.

78
00:19:17,626 --> 00:19:18,876
Let me.

79
00:19:18,959 --> 00:19:21,418
- Dad!
- Wait.

80
00:19:21,501 --> 00:19:23,418
Watch and learn.

81
00:19:44,543 --> 00:19:46,501
I'll be right back.

82
00:19:50,376 --> 00:19:52,251
Tanya, we're coming.

83
00:19:52,334 --> 00:19:53,459
Sergei.

84
00:19:54,709 --> 00:19:57,168
I'm talking to my son.
Hold on.

85
00:19:57,251 --> 00:19:59,584
Go and talk with
your mother.

86
00:20:00,418 --> 00:20:02,126
I said hold on.

87
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,376
Ma, have you two
discussed Sasha?

88
00:20:12,459 --> 00:20:14,209
No, but I will.

89
00:20:14,293 --> 00:20:16,334
What are you
dragging it out for?

90
00:20:16,418 --> 00:20:19,459
We have to know if we're
getting the money or not.

91
00:20:21,001 --> 00:20:24,293
You know how he feels
about that sort of thing.

92
00:20:26,584 --> 00:20:31,084
He knows Sasha.
They're even friends, sort of.

93
00:20:32,126 --> 00:20:34,293
We're family after all.

94
00:20:34,376 --> 00:20:38,793
He's a friend to everyone,
but friends with no one.

95
00:20:39,876 --> 00:20:43,584
- He's just a tightass.
- Come on, Sergei, stop it.

96
00:20:43,668 --> 00:20:46,626
If it wasn't for him,
we wouldn't have what we do.

97
00:20:48,918 --> 00:20:50,709
And what is that, exactly?

98
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,418
We can't let Sasha
be drafted.

99
00:20:54,501 --> 00:20:57,751
We've got to know now
if he's going to university

100
00:20:57,834 --> 00:21:01,043
or straight to Ossetia.
Right, Tanya?

101
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:02,668
More tea, Elena?

102
00:21:02,751 --> 00:21:04,668
Sasha, what time's football?

103
00:21:04,751 --> 00:21:05,959
Nine.

104
00:21:07,876 --> 00:21:10,501
We're quite worried.

105
00:21:10,584 --> 00:21:14,293
We need to make a deal with the right
people at school and university.

106
00:21:14,376 --> 00:21:16,376
The 20th is the deadline.

107
00:21:16,459 --> 00:21:18,168
I'll talk to him, I promise.

108
00:21:18,668 --> 00:21:21,834
<i>If you're watching this</i>

109
00:21:21,918 --> 00:21:26,668
<i>and you want to meet
up and to talk, too,</i>

110
00:21:26,751 --> 00:21:32,751
<i>I'd be glad to, because I
want you to know that I'm here.</i>

111
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:37,418
<i>It looked like he
didn't even try.</i>

112
00:21:37,501 --> 00:21:39,626
<i>It's pretty strange.</i>

113
00:21:39,709 --> 00:21:43,376
<i>It's not the first time.
He seems disappointed, too.</i>

114
00:21:43,459 --> 00:21:45,376
<i>He chose to run like that!</i>

115
00:21:45,459 --> 00:21:46,876
<i>Then again, 9.8 sec...</i>

116
00:21:46,959 --> 00:21:51,043
<i>It is good,
but it should have gone differently.</i>

117
00:21:51,126 --> 00:21:56,584
<i>I'm looking for
my two brothers.</i>

118
00:21:57,543 --> 00:22:02,209
<i>My mother left
my father in 1960,</i>

119
00:22:02,293 --> 00:22:06,876
<i>and I didn't
know I had a dad</i>

120
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:11,334
<i>until he wrote to
me when I was 13.</i>

121
00:22:11,418 --> 00:22:13,918
<i>He said he had
another family</i>

122
00:22:14,001 --> 00:22:16,709
<i>and that I
had two brothers.</i>

123
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:20,043
<i>I still haven't been
able to find them.</i>

124
00:22:20,126 --> 00:22:24,001
<i>If they know I exist,</i>

125
00:22:24,084 --> 00:22:27,959
<i>they should get in touch.
Finding them is my life's work.</i>

126
00:22:41,584 --> 00:22:44,584
<i>It's a typical Soviet strategy:</i>

127
00:22:44,668 --> 00:22:47,959
<i>pile on the pressure,
hoping that he'll...</i>

128
00:22:48,043 --> 00:22:50,834
<i>Maybe he'll get there
by the end of the season.</i>

129
00:22:50,918 --> 00:22:54,126
<i>He's already
performing differently,</i>

130
00:22:54,209 --> 00:22:56,709
<i>but it's not showing
in his results yet.</i>

131
00:23:41,918 --> 00:23:43,293
Good morning.

132
00:25:10,084 --> 00:25:12,168
I read your note.

133
00:25:13,501 --> 00:25:15,751
Of course,
I understand that Sasha...

134
00:25:17,043 --> 00:25:20,834
...won't get in anywhere
with his grades, will he?

135
00:25:20,918 --> 00:25:23,084
I'm afraid not.

136
00:25:23,168 --> 00:25:26,751
Why doesn't he serve in the army, then?
It's the best school there is.

137
00:25:26,834 --> 00:25:30,293
Vladimir, you know
what it's like in the army.

138
00:25:31,584 --> 00:25:36,043
Why am I supposed to support
your son's family?

139
00:25:38,293 --> 00:25:41,918
Why should I be burdened
with paying for someone's,

140
00:25:42,001 --> 00:25:47,084
effectively a stranger's,
education?

141
00:25:47,168 --> 00:25:50,376
I live with you,
not your relatives.

142
00:25:50,459 --> 00:25:53,126
You know how
I feel about this.

143
00:25:53,959 --> 00:25:57,209
And your Sergei still hasn't
returned the money

144
00:25:57,293 --> 00:25:59,293
he borrowed from me
three years ago.

145
00:25:59,376 --> 00:26:01,043
I know.

146
00:26:01,126 --> 00:26:04,793
But you know about
Sergei's current situation.

147
00:26:04,876 --> 00:26:10,001
I know your Sergei,
and his "situation" is clear to me.

148
00:26:10,709 --> 00:26:12,334
Very clear.

149
00:26:12,418 --> 00:26:14,584
His whole life is
one big "situation".

150
00:26:14,668 --> 00:26:16,959
It has been ever
since he was born.

151
00:26:17,043 --> 00:26:19,209
I refuse to indulge
him any more.

152
00:26:19,293 --> 00:26:22,293
Let this be a lesson to him.

153
00:26:24,293 --> 00:26:27,709
You don't force lessons like
that on your daughter.

154
00:26:27,793 --> 00:26:30,293
And I'm sure
you never have.

155
00:26:31,043 --> 00:26:35,418
Elena, we're talking about your son.
It's like you're not listening.

156
00:26:35,501 --> 00:26:40,209
He needs to get his ass
off the couch and find a job.

157
00:26:40,293 --> 00:26:42,709
Feed his family.

158
00:26:42,793 --> 00:26:48,126
If we were talking about
the boy's health, God forbid,

159
00:26:48,209 --> 00:26:52,209
the money would be
on the table tomorrow.

160
00:26:52,293 --> 00:26:55,043
But we are talking
about his health.

161
00:26:55,126 --> 00:27:00,626
If you had a grandson,
would you let him serve in the army?

162
00:27:00,709 --> 00:27:04,459
Sasha just needs help.
Give him a chance.

163
00:27:04,543 --> 00:27:07,209
Leave my daughter out of this!

164
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:10,293
Why did you bring her up?

165
00:27:13,126 --> 00:27:15,334
It's not my fault

166
00:27:15,418 --> 00:27:18,918
if she's the way she is.
I did everything in my power.

167
00:27:19,001 --> 00:27:21,043
But she turned out
like her mother.

168
00:27:21,126 --> 00:27:25,543
Only interested in
enjoying herself.

169
00:27:25,626 --> 00:27:27,584
A goddamn hedonist.

170
00:27:30,334 --> 00:27:32,709
I don't know what
that word means.

171
00:27:32,793 --> 00:27:34,168
You'd say "selfish".

172
00:27:34,251 --> 00:27:36,584
Vladimir, will you help Sasha?

173
00:27:36,668 --> 00:27:39,668
I don't know.
I need to think about it.

174
00:27:40,418 --> 00:27:44,876
I hope you aren't taking money
out on your credit card for them.

175
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:51,834
I can account for
every rouble.

176
00:27:51,918 --> 00:27:53,751
No, there's no
need for that.

177
00:27:54,834 --> 00:27:56,584
I shouldn't have said that.

178
00:27:57,584 --> 00:27:59,418
I'm sorry.

179
00:27:59,501 --> 00:28:01,334
I'm getting carried away.

180
00:28:06,126 --> 00:28:07,376
OK.

181
00:28:08,543 --> 00:28:11,334
When do they
need the money?

182
00:28:11,418 --> 00:28:13,584
No later than the 20th.

183
00:28:15,459 --> 00:28:17,959
I'll give you my
answer in a week.

184
00:28:18,543 --> 00:28:20,709
Make me another coffee,
please.

185
00:29:15,418 --> 00:29:17,418
What have you got
planned for today?

186
00:29:18,418 --> 00:29:20,168
House cleaning.

187
00:29:21,209 --> 00:29:23,501
I'm going to the gym.

188
00:29:24,293 --> 00:29:25,584
I know.

189
00:29:48,959 --> 00:29:50,334
Come on, you.

190
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,459
Let's go, come on.

191
00:30:23,168 --> 00:30:24,418
Elena!

192
00:30:25,501 --> 00:30:27,293
Bring me my things.

193
00:30:28,418 --> 00:30:29,668
Coming.

194
00:34:17,793 --> 00:34:19,084
Good afternoon.

195
00:34:20,209 --> 00:34:22,376
Enjoy Fitness,
Irina speaking.

196
00:34:25,751 --> 00:34:28,001
- Enjoy your workout.
- Thank you.

197
00:34:32,751 --> 00:34:34,834
- Good afternoon.
- Hello. Your towel.

198
00:37:18,251 --> 00:37:19,501
Anton!

199
00:37:20,584 --> 00:37:22,001
Put them down there.

200
00:37:26,543 --> 00:37:29,043
This is for you,
this is for me.

201
00:37:39,959 --> 00:37:41,293
Here.

202
00:37:44,959 --> 00:37:46,959
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

203
00:37:56,793 --> 00:37:58,293
Bye.

204
00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:57,501
Yes, speaking.

205
00:39:16,876 --> 00:39:18,293
Hello.

206
00:39:48,209 --> 00:39:49,584
Remember?

207
00:39:50,668 --> 00:39:52,959
This is how we met.

208
00:39:53,043 --> 00:39:54,501
Of course.

209
00:39:56,209 --> 00:39:57,459
What year was that?

210
00:39:58,751 --> 00:40:00,876
It'll be ten years
in December.

211
00:40:04,959 --> 00:40:06,751
I would give everything...

212
00:40:08,376 --> 00:40:12,418
...to wake up back then,
ten years ago.

213
00:40:12,959 --> 00:40:15,501
And not here and now.

214
00:40:17,584 --> 00:40:20,918
That being said,
appendicitis is still better

215
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:24,793
than a heart attack.

216
00:40:24,876 --> 00:40:28,084
That was hardly appendicitis.
More like peritonitis.

217
00:40:30,084 --> 00:40:33,043
You're a born nurse.

218
00:40:34,584 --> 00:40:38,376
Of course it was better!
If only because

219
00:40:38,459 --> 00:40:40,376
you were looking after me.

220
00:40:43,209 --> 00:40:47,959
Although the girls
here aren't bad.

221
00:40:49,168 --> 00:40:53,293
Keep it up and I'll cut off
your oxygen! That'll teach you.

222
00:40:53,376 --> 00:40:55,293
You'd do it, too.

223
00:40:57,001 --> 00:40:59,793
- Did you talk to the doctor?
- Not yet.

224
00:41:00,668 --> 00:41:02,918
All he does

225
00:41:03,001 --> 00:41:05,834
is try to reassure
me by telling me

226
00:41:05,918 --> 00:41:07,876
they won't keep
me in much longer.

227
00:41:07,959 --> 00:41:10,001
So it's not that bad.

228
00:41:11,584 --> 00:41:13,668
Or it could be the
other way around.

229
00:41:33,209 --> 00:41:36,584
Elena, please call Katya.

230
00:41:36,668 --> 00:41:38,334
Yes, of course.

231
00:41:50,459 --> 00:41:53,084
Hello, Katya.

232
00:41:53,168 --> 00:41:55,168
This is Elena.

233
00:41:55,251 --> 00:41:57,168
<i>Yes, hello.</i>

234
00:41:57,251 --> 00:42:00,959
I'm sorry to say
I have some bad news.

235
00:42:01,043 --> 00:42:04,751
Your dad's in hospital.
He's had a heart attack.

236
00:42:04,834 --> 00:42:06,918
He wants to see you.

237
00:42:07,001 --> 00:42:08,834
You will come, won't you?

238
00:42:10,626 --> 00:42:12,376
<i>I can't today.
Tomorrow.</i>

239
00:42:12,459 --> 00:42:16,876
Well, alright. I'd like to
meet with you first to talk.

240
00:42:18,293 --> 00:42:20,501
<i>Is that really necessary?</i>

241
00:42:20,584 --> 00:42:22,168
Yes, I think it is.

242
00:42:23,501 --> 00:42:25,043
<i>Fine.
Where?</i>

243
00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:26,668
Wherever's best for you.

244
00:42:45,834 --> 00:42:47,418
Hello, Elena Anatolievna.

245
00:42:47,501 --> 00:42:50,876
Hello, Katya.
Do you want anything?

246
00:42:50,959 --> 00:42:52,251
I'll do without.

247
00:42:55,334 --> 00:42:57,668
What I wanted to say is this.

248
00:42:58,293 --> 00:43:00,209
Your dad had a
heart attack...

249
00:43:00,293 --> 00:43:03,418
- I got that part.
- He's very weak.

250
00:43:03,501 --> 00:43:06,584
- He's conscious, though?
- Yes, thank God.

251
00:43:06,668 --> 00:43:10,001
He's probably groped his way
through all the nurses already.

252
00:43:13,251 --> 00:43:14,459
Katya!

253
00:43:14,543 --> 00:43:16,251
Yes, Elena Anatolievna?

254
00:43:16,709 --> 00:43:19,209
I want to ask you

255
00:43:19,293 --> 00:43:20,876
to go easy on him.

256
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:22,709
Right now,
he needs rest.

257
00:43:24,418 --> 00:43:26,626
He needs your love.

258
00:43:26,709 --> 00:43:29,376
Show him that
you love him.

259
00:43:29,459 --> 00:43:33,084
You see each other so rarely,
which I don't understand at all.

260
00:43:33,918 --> 00:43:37,293
- But that's your business.
- Indeed it is.

261
00:43:37,376 --> 00:43:39,126
Katya, you never call him.

262
00:43:40,543 --> 00:43:42,334
You should.

263
00:43:42,959 --> 00:43:44,376
Maybe this attack...

264
00:43:44,459 --> 00:43:46,668
It's the prodigal
daughter's fault?

265
00:43:46,751 --> 00:43:48,501
In part,
I'm sure that's true.

266
00:43:50,084 --> 00:43:52,126
Listen, Elena Anatolievna.

267
00:43:52,209 --> 00:43:55,834
You're playing the worried wife.
You do it very well.

268
00:43:55,918 --> 00:43:57,001
Congratulations!

269
00:43:57,084 --> 00:43:58,876
So that's that.
Have you finished?

270
00:43:59,918 --> 00:44:01,209
I love Vladimir.

271
00:44:02,168 --> 00:44:04,543
Till death do you part.
I don't doubt it.

272
00:44:06,084 --> 00:44:08,918
Like a true nurse,
you're trying to cure me.

273
00:44:09,001 --> 00:44:11,876
But I don't need
your treatment.

274
00:44:11,959 --> 00:44:13,793
I am what I am.

275
00:44:17,459 --> 00:44:19,209
Tell me,

276
00:44:19,293 --> 00:44:21,876
are you not at all sorry
for your father?

277
00:44:24,126 --> 00:44:25,751
I understand that that's...

278
00:44:27,543 --> 00:44:30,418
...a rhetorical question,
but I'll answer anyway.

279
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:33,209
I don't give a flying fuck.

280
00:44:33,584 --> 00:44:35,168
Dear God!

281
00:44:35,251 --> 00:44:37,168
What room is he in?

282
00:44:38,543 --> 00:44:43,043
Maybe it's not such a good idea
for you to see him today.

283
00:44:43,126 --> 00:44:45,418
Another time.

284
00:44:45,501 --> 00:44:47,293
When he's better...

285
00:44:47,376 --> 00:44:51,334
Then why did you call me yesterday
rather than waiting until he's better?

286
00:44:51,418 --> 00:44:52,834
Your father asked me to.

287
00:44:53,501 --> 00:44:55,793
What room is Dad in?

288
00:44:58,084 --> 00:44:59,584
Hello.

289
00:44:59,668 --> 00:45:01,001
Could you tell me...

290
00:45:01,084 --> 00:45:03,751
Please cover your head
in the house of the Lord.

291
00:45:08,043 --> 00:45:11,709
I wanted to ask which saint
I should light a candle to.

292
00:45:11,793 --> 00:45:14,001
For someone who
is deceased or ill?

293
00:45:14,084 --> 00:45:17,084
- My husband's in hospital.
- A prayer for his health, then.

294
00:45:18,334 --> 00:45:20,293
Write his name
on a slip of paper.

295
00:45:20,376 --> 00:45:23,543
The priest will pray for his health
during the service.

296
00:45:23,626 --> 00:45:25,334
Place a candle

297
00:45:25,418 --> 00:45:28,834
in front of Saint Nicholas
and the Mother of God.

298
00:45:28,918 --> 00:45:31,501
And while you're lighting it,

299
00:45:31,584 --> 00:45:34,168
ask the Lord for health
and assistance.

300
00:45:35,084 --> 00:45:38,168
Could you tell me
where those icons are?

301
00:45:38,959 --> 00:45:41,668
Straight ahead,
to the right of the altar.

302
00:45:41,751 --> 00:45:42,918
Thank you.

303
00:47:01,418 --> 00:47:03,918
I barely see you, Katya.

304
00:47:04,626 --> 00:47:06,876
That's because the
sun's in your eyes.

305
00:47:06,959 --> 00:47:09,918
I didn't mean it
in that sense.

306
00:47:10,001 --> 00:47:12,668
There is no such
thing as sense.

307
00:47:14,418 --> 00:47:18,084
Looking at you, sometimes I think
that might even be true.

308
00:47:20,543 --> 00:47:23,334
It's a good thing
you barely see me, then.

309
00:47:30,418 --> 00:47:32,918
I was never your
reason for living.

310
00:47:33,084 --> 00:47:35,793
And thank God,
you might say.

311
00:47:35,876 --> 00:47:37,543
You're wrong about that.

312
00:47:38,418 --> 00:47:42,501
Money, Dad, has always been
your only reason for living.

313
00:47:42,584 --> 00:47:44,459
What are you doing?

314
00:47:44,543 --> 00:47:46,959
Making an inventory
of my life?

315
00:47:47,043 --> 00:47:49,376
Money's important to you, too.

316
00:47:49,459 --> 00:47:51,043
Not that important.

317
00:47:51,918 --> 00:47:56,834
Maybe that's because you've
never earned any yourself.

318
00:47:58,543 --> 00:48:01,918
Maybe that's because
you spoilt me,

319
00:48:02,001 --> 00:48:04,251
gave me everything
on a plate.

320
00:48:05,251 --> 00:48:06,793
That sounds like a complaint.

321
00:48:06,876 --> 00:48:10,626
You know I adore you.
Keep it coming, please.

322
00:48:10,709 --> 00:48:13,084
I don't know why I do this.

323
00:48:14,459 --> 00:48:16,918
You don't know what
you're paying for?

324
00:48:17,001 --> 00:48:19,793
No, what you
make me pay for.

325
00:48:19,876 --> 00:48:22,751
You're priceless.

326
00:48:22,834 --> 00:48:25,668
You've always loved
those word games.

327
00:48:26,501 --> 00:48:31,209
Games help children come to terms
with the cruel laws of reality.

328
00:48:32,751 --> 00:48:34,126
Children?

329
00:48:34,209 --> 00:48:39,376
Nope. No. I'm not pregnant,
if that's what you're asking.

330
00:48:39,459 --> 00:48:40,709
Too bad.

331
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:45,043
It'd sort you out.

332
00:48:45,126 --> 00:48:46,459
I'm sorted.

333
00:48:48,001 --> 00:48:50,709
Alcohol and drugs
at weekends only.

334
00:48:50,793 --> 00:48:52,918
It's all clean living now.

335
00:48:53,001 --> 00:48:56,251
I'm still getting sex and
food under control.

336
00:48:56,334 --> 00:48:58,418
But I'm working on it,
trust me.

337
00:48:58,501 --> 00:49:00,293
You're not smoking
in here, right?

338
00:49:00,376 --> 00:49:03,043
- Why not?
- It's a hospital, Katya.

339
00:49:04,043 --> 00:49:07,876
So what? You paid for a big suite.
You can do whatever you like.

340
00:49:07,959 --> 00:49:09,584
Are you serious?

341
00:49:10,876 --> 00:49:13,168
Fine, I'll go and smoke
where I'm allowed to.

342
00:49:13,834 --> 00:49:15,418
Hold on...

343
00:49:16,376 --> 00:49:18,168
What now?

344
00:49:19,543 --> 00:49:21,626
Where did you get this...?

345
00:49:23,876 --> 00:49:26,501
Where do you think?

346
00:49:26,584 --> 00:49:28,668
Genes, Dad, heritage.

347
00:49:28,751 --> 00:49:31,043
I'm a rotten seed.

348
00:49:31,126 --> 00:49:34,459
We're all bad seeds.
Subhuman.

349
00:49:35,084 --> 00:49:38,959
Go and have some babies.
Maybe they'll turn out different.

350
00:49:42,876 --> 00:49:45,793
Different from everyone else?

351
00:49:47,168 --> 00:49:49,709
There's no such
thing as different.

352
00:49:51,251 --> 00:49:54,376
And I don't feel like experimenting
with that kind of thing.

353
00:49:54,459 --> 00:49:56,251
It's painful, expensive.

354
00:49:58,793 --> 00:50:00,501
And pointless.

355
00:50:00,584 --> 00:50:02,793
With you,
everything is pointless.

356
00:50:05,209 --> 00:50:08,834
You're making
dumb excuses

357
00:50:08,918 --> 00:50:11,543
to avoid your responsibility.

358
00:50:11,626 --> 00:50:14,834
Dad, what's irresponsible

359
00:50:14,918 --> 00:50:19,668
is producing offspring you
know will be sick and doomed,

360
00:50:19,751 --> 00:50:21,418
since the parents

361
00:50:21,501 --> 00:50:23,543
are sick and
doomed themselves.

362
00:50:24,293 --> 00:50:27,043
And doing it

363
00:50:27,126 --> 00:50:29,918
only because
everyone is doing it,

364
00:50:30,001 --> 00:50:34,043
because there's some
"higher meaning" to it all,

365
00:50:34,126 --> 00:50:36,668
which is not ours
to comprehend,

366
00:50:36,751 --> 00:50:40,459
since we're merely the ones who
have to carry out this higher purpose.

367
00:50:40,543 --> 00:50:45,376
Shit must be tasty.
Millions of flies can't be wrong.

368
00:50:49,668 --> 00:50:53,293
And the world will end soon,
in case you haven't heard.

369
00:50:53,376 --> 00:50:55,209
You know, it's strange.

370
00:50:55,293 --> 00:50:58,084
But listening to you,
I feel a lot better.

371
00:50:58,168 --> 00:51:02,209
See, that's exactly
why you breed:

372
00:51:02,293 --> 00:51:04,709
to suck the life
out of your children.

373
00:51:04,793 --> 00:51:07,376
Then you ask,
"Where does all this come from?"

374
00:51:08,584 --> 00:51:11,251
You're such a
twit sometimes!

375
00:51:11,334 --> 00:51:12,751
Thanks.

376
00:51:13,334 --> 00:51:14,959
I love you very much.

377
00:51:19,209 --> 00:51:20,501
Can we do without that?

378
00:51:20,584 --> 00:51:21,918
Come on!

379
00:51:23,834 --> 00:51:27,168
What one wouldn't
do for money.

380
00:51:27,379 --> 00:51:28,842
See?

381
00:51:28,926 --> 00:51:34,128
Now, at last you're
starting to see the point.

382
00:51:34,584 --> 00:51:36,876
Just don't lose
sight of it yourself.

383
00:51:36,959 --> 00:51:38,584
What a pest!

384
00:51:38,668 --> 00:51:39,918
A pest?

385
00:51:40,001 --> 00:51:41,793
I thought it was
a heart attack.

386
00:51:42,793 --> 00:51:44,751
Come, let me kiss you.

387
00:52:00,918 --> 00:52:04,459
Are you making a phone call?

388
00:52:04,543 --> 00:52:05,709
Are you phoning Mum?

389
00:52:05,876 --> 00:52:07,209
Go on, give her a ring.

390
00:52:19,376 --> 00:52:24,209
Come on. Let's go and see
what's going on in the kitchen.

391
00:52:25,376 --> 00:52:27,209
Have a look outside.

392
00:52:28,168 --> 00:52:30,418
See if there are
any sparrows about.

393
00:52:52,584 --> 00:52:54,584
It needs to boil some more.

394
00:52:54,668 --> 00:52:57,418
Where are those sparrows?

395
00:52:58,043 --> 00:52:59,126
Bless you.

396
00:52:59,584 --> 00:53:03,459
Above all, follow the
medication schedule closely.

397
00:53:03,543 --> 00:53:05,918
Next, diet is critical.

398
00:53:06,001 --> 00:53:08,709
And take it easy.
Don't do anything stressful.

399
00:53:08,793 --> 00:53:10,001
Nothing.

400
00:53:12,043 --> 00:53:15,209
I would recommend
hiring a qualified caretaker.

401
00:53:15,293 --> 00:53:19,751
I worked in a hospital
looking after patients for years.

402
00:53:19,834 --> 00:53:21,834
- Perfect.
- See you around, doctor.

403
00:53:21,918 --> 00:53:24,751
You, too. Take care of yourself.
All the best.

404
00:53:24,834 --> 00:53:25,959
Goodbye.

405
00:54:23,001 --> 00:54:25,626
<i>I think we're
seeing our refs...</i>

406
00:54:25,709 --> 00:54:28,418
<i>I'm not talking
about today's refs.</i>

407
00:54:28,501 --> 00:54:31,959
<i>But all this talk
about mistakes by referees,</i>

408
00:54:32,043 --> 00:54:33,876
<i>it's making them
hedge their bets.</i>

409
00:54:33,959 --> 00:54:37,876
<i>If we filed away the tapes of this show
and watched them in five years' time,</i>

410
00:54:37,959 --> 00:54:43,543
<i>the country would be shocked
at the way it's all repeating itself.</i>

411
00:54:43,626 --> 00:54:46,626
<i>You'll pay for
what you have done.</i>

412
00:54:47,084 --> 00:54:48,918
<i>You won't get
away with it, either.</i>

413
00:54:49,001 --> 00:54:52,501
<i>But I wish you,
our audience, all the best.</i>

414
00:54:52,584 --> 00:54:53,751
<i>Goodbye.</i>

415
00:56:09,001 --> 00:56:10,543
Elena.

416
00:56:11,293 --> 00:56:13,001
I have something...

417
00:56:14,668 --> 00:56:16,334
...I need to tell you.

418
00:56:16,418 --> 00:56:17,834
Your pills.

419
00:56:31,834 --> 00:56:33,001
Basically,...

420
00:56:34,751 --> 00:56:36,959
...I've decided
to write a will.

421
00:56:38,376 --> 00:56:41,126
I'm sorry, but this makes me
really uncomfortable.

422
00:56:41,209 --> 00:56:43,334
Elena, this is important.

423
00:56:43,418 --> 00:56:46,251
I need to be
straight with you.

424
00:56:46,334 --> 00:56:49,668
I think it's the
right thing to do.

425
00:56:50,501 --> 00:56:53,751
Everyone's wondering
what'll happen after I'm gone.

426
00:56:53,834 --> 00:56:55,418
No, it's not like that.

427
00:56:57,043 --> 00:57:00,209
All the same,
we need to talk about it.

428
00:57:00,293 --> 00:57:02,043
Fair enough.

429
00:57:02,126 --> 00:57:04,959
Besides you and
my daughter,

430
00:57:05,043 --> 00:57:07,751
I don't have anyone else
in this world.

431
00:57:07,834 --> 00:57:10,168
After I die,

432
00:57:10,251 --> 00:57:12,626
my daughter will inherit
almost everything.

433
00:57:12,709 --> 00:57:14,668
And you,

434
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:16,959
as my spouse,

435
00:57:17,043 --> 00:57:19,126
will receive a life annuity.

436
00:57:20,334 --> 00:57:23,793
Monthly payments.

437
00:57:24,793 --> 00:57:28,834
I'm confident they will
be more than enough.

438
00:57:30,959 --> 00:57:33,209
That's it, really.

439
00:57:34,043 --> 00:57:36,251
I've been building up
to this for so long

440
00:57:36,334 --> 00:57:38,168
and I fired it out
in ten seconds.

441
00:57:40,084 --> 00:57:43,834
Is there something...
you want to say?

442
00:57:45,501 --> 00:57:46,876
Yes.

443
00:57:48,001 --> 00:57:49,376
There is.

444
00:57:55,043 --> 00:57:58,251
It's not about what
you were saying,

445
00:57:58,334 --> 00:58:00,918
but it seems like
the right time.

446
00:58:02,001 --> 00:58:03,209
What is it?

447
00:58:04,501 --> 00:58:06,501
- The other thing.
- What thing?

448
00:58:08,668 --> 00:58:10,876
The thing with Sasha.

449
00:58:18,084 --> 00:58:20,418
I think

450
00:58:20,501 --> 00:58:22,834
that his father, your son,

451
00:58:22,918 --> 00:58:25,834
should be taking
care of his own son.

452
00:58:28,334 --> 00:58:30,251
Vladimir...

453
00:58:30,334 --> 00:58:33,209
What were they thinking
when they had him?

454
00:58:35,668 --> 00:58:37,668
It was an accident.

455
00:58:37,751 --> 00:58:40,084
Both times?
Don't make me laugh.

456
00:58:40,918 --> 00:58:44,793
It's no laughing matter.
It just happened,

457
00:58:44,876 --> 00:58:46,751
like it does to everybody.

458
00:58:46,834 --> 00:58:50,918
First one kid by accident,
then another.

459
00:58:51,001 --> 00:58:54,001
And now I'm supposed
to feed them?

460
00:58:55,168 --> 00:58:58,459
It's not the money
that bothers me.

461
00:58:58,543 --> 00:59:00,459
Of course not.

462
00:59:00,543 --> 00:59:03,043
You give it all to your
inconsiderate daughter.

463
00:59:03,876 --> 00:59:06,334
Here we go again!

464
00:59:07,459 --> 00:59:10,084
First of all, not all of it.

465
00:59:10,709 --> 00:59:13,209
And second of all,
you don't know her.

466
00:59:13,293 --> 00:59:15,251
She's actually quite sensible.

467
00:59:15,543 --> 00:59:18,251
Inconsiderate
and off the rails.

468
00:59:18,334 --> 00:59:20,293
I don't want to hear it.

469
00:59:20,376 --> 00:59:23,084
And apparently infertile, too.

470
00:59:23,168 --> 00:59:24,959
Nonsense.

471
00:59:25,043 --> 00:59:28,918
She's just different.
She's not like you and me.

472
00:59:29,001 --> 00:59:33,709
Of course she's nothing like
my son and his children!

473
00:59:35,251 --> 00:59:36,751
You said it.

474
00:59:37,084 --> 00:59:38,709
Dear God!

475
00:59:40,918 --> 00:59:42,751
What gives you the right?

476
00:59:42,959 --> 00:59:43,959
What?

477
00:59:46,126 --> 00:59:49,626
What right do you have
to think you're special?

478
00:59:51,418 --> 00:59:53,209
Why?

479
00:59:53,293 --> 00:59:57,251
Just because you have more money?
More things?

480
00:59:59,418 --> 01:00:01,418
All that can change.

481
01:00:01,501 --> 01:00:03,709
What can change, exactly?

482
01:00:06,293 --> 01:00:08,418
The last shall be first.

483
01:00:08,584 --> 01:00:11,126
Ah, I've heard
that one before.

484
01:00:11,209 --> 01:00:15,501
Biblical fairy tales

485
01:00:15,584 --> 01:00:17,459
for the poor
and the foolish.

486
01:00:18,876 --> 01:00:21,418
Equality and fraternity

487
01:00:21,501 --> 01:00:25,293
are only to be found in your
kingdom of heaven, Elena.

488
01:00:28,793 --> 01:00:32,793
Well, you probably
have a lot to do.

489
01:00:32,876 --> 01:00:35,209
Yes, quite a lot.

490
01:00:37,501 --> 01:00:39,001
Do you want anything?

491
01:00:40,043 --> 01:00:43,084
I only want to know
that you understood me.

492
01:00:43,168 --> 01:00:45,251
I did.

493
01:00:45,584 --> 01:00:49,043
Elena, let's deal with
this like adults.

494
01:00:50,501 --> 01:00:52,918
We are adults.
We'll get through it.

495
01:00:53,001 --> 01:00:55,376
And I'm glad you understand.

496
01:00:55,543 --> 01:00:56,876
Can you please bring me

497
01:00:56,959 --> 01:01:01,293
a pen and paper?
The lawyer is coming tomorrow,

498
01:01:01,376 --> 01:01:04,501
and I want to sketch out
a draft of the will.

499
01:01:59,043 --> 01:02:00,501
Sergei, hi.

500
01:02:02,334 --> 01:02:04,334
Fine, thanks.

501
01:02:06,751 --> 01:02:09,793
Better, but still weak.

502
01:02:09,876 --> 01:02:11,126
Listen...

503
01:02:12,043 --> 01:02:14,251
I talked to him about Sasha.

504
01:02:15,543 --> 01:02:18,709
We'll have to deal
with this ourselves.

505
01:02:18,793 --> 01:02:20,251
Yes, that's it.

506
01:02:22,376 --> 01:02:25,959
He says it's your job as a father
to deal with the problem.

507
01:02:27,543 --> 01:02:29,168
Stop it.

508
01:02:29,251 --> 01:02:31,209
Stop, would you?

509
01:02:34,043 --> 01:02:36,043
I'm upset myself.

510
01:02:37,334 --> 01:02:40,293
But I think there's some
truth in what he says.

511
01:02:40,376 --> 01:02:42,168
We'll figure it
out ourselves.

512
01:02:43,584 --> 01:02:45,376
We'll think of something.

513
01:02:46,918 --> 01:02:49,043
I'll call later, OK?

514
01:02:52,834 --> 01:02:54,626
Shit.

515
01:02:54,709 --> 01:02:55,959
The tightass!

516
01:03:08,834 --> 01:03:10,126
Tanya!

517
01:03:11,084 --> 01:03:12,668
Where's my beer?

518
01:03:13,793 --> 01:03:15,959
Did you get the
baby's formula?

519
01:03:17,084 --> 01:03:18,876
There was a damn
bottle in here.

520
01:03:26,959 --> 01:03:28,709
Did you finish
your homework?

521
01:03:28,793 --> 01:03:30,293
Yeah.

522
01:04:03,084 --> 01:04:04,751
Did you do
your homework?

523
01:04:04,834 --> 01:04:06,626
Yes, I already did it!

524
01:07:06,043 --> 01:07:07,709
What a mess in here.

525
01:07:09,001 --> 01:07:10,668
It's all coming out wrong.

526
01:07:11,376 --> 01:07:14,459
I can't concentrate.

527
01:07:14,793 --> 01:07:16,543
Medicine first.

528
01:08:06,418 --> 01:08:08,001
Elena!

529
01:08:13,293 --> 01:08:15,751
I've had enough.
Thanks.

530
01:08:15,834 --> 01:08:17,543
Do you want to
take a nap?

531
01:08:18,376 --> 01:08:20,209
Think I will.

532
01:15:55,876 --> 01:15:57,918
I can't believe it.

533
01:15:58,001 --> 01:16:00,668
No one told
you to abstain?

534
01:16:00,751 --> 01:16:04,376
It's strictly prohibited
after a heart attack.

535
01:16:04,459 --> 01:16:07,668
I'm telling you,
I didn't even know that he had it.

536
01:16:09,793 --> 01:16:12,584
Like little kids, I swear.

537
01:16:12,668 --> 01:16:16,334
Dumb teenagers
have more sense.

538
01:16:18,334 --> 01:16:20,543
You could be a
bit more tactful.

539
01:16:21,543 --> 01:16:23,501
How much more tactful?

540
01:17:44,293 --> 01:17:46,168
Dear relatives,

541
01:17:46,251 --> 01:17:48,459
friends and colleagues
of the deceased,

542
01:17:48,543 --> 01:17:50,751
it is time to say farewell.

543
01:18:01,043 --> 01:18:03,084
Final farewells.

544
01:20:56,376 --> 01:21:01,209
<i>Sausage No. 4 is the best,
though it's too salty for me.</i>

545
01:21:02,209 --> 01:21:05,168
<i>I think the one closest
to milk sausage is No. 4.</i>

546
01:21:05,251 --> 01:21:06,876
<i>My vote goes to No. 4.</i>

547
01:21:06,959 --> 01:21:11,959
<i>It's got a distinct sausage taste,
unlike No. 3.</i>

548
01:21:12,043 --> 01:21:13,959
<i>we all have our
own methods.</i>

549
01:21:14,043 --> 01:21:17,501
<i>The colour and taste of No. 3...
I vote for No. 3.</i>

550
01:21:17,584 --> 01:21:18,751
<i>Please.</i>

551
01:21:18,834 --> 01:21:22,001
<i>Our jurors here
are regular shoppers.</i>

552
01:21:22,084 --> 01:21:25,626
<i>They can only vote
for one sausage.</i>

553
01:21:25,709 --> 01:21:28,293
<i>All of the labels
have been covered up.</i>

554
01:21:28,376 --> 01:21:31,918
<i>I voted for No. 6.
It was pretty edible.</i>

555
01:21:32,001 --> 01:21:34,918
<i>You can't taste the rusk,
and there's no starch.</i>

556
01:21:35,001 --> 01:21:38,168
<i>It's an OK sausage.</i>

557
01:21:38,334 --> 01:21:40,709
<i>This one's too moist,
too watery.</i>

558
01:21:40,793 --> 01:21:43,334
<i>Cook it a little more...</i>

559
01:21:43,418 --> 01:21:46,834
<i>It's a sign that it
wasn't made right.</i>

560
01:21:46,918 --> 01:21:49,668
<i>A sausage just
shouldn't be like that.</i>

561
01:21:49,751 --> 01:21:52,251
<i>The contest will continue
in the laboratory,</i>

562
01:21:52,334 --> 01:21:55,043
<i>where the winner
will be chosen.</i>

563
01:21:55,251 --> 01:21:57,168
<i>I liked No. 6.</i>

564
01:21:57,251 --> 01:22:01,543
<i>I can't figure out
what No. 1 is made from.</i>

565
01:22:01,626 --> 01:22:05,918
<i>I'd never buy a sausage
that looked like that.</i>

566
01:22:06,001 --> 01:22:08,834
<i>No. 5 is a
waste of money.</i>

567
01:22:08,918 --> 01:22:13,584
<i>Don't spend your hard-earned
money on something like that.</i>

568
01:22:13,751 --> 01:22:14,959
<i>It tastes like plastic!</i>

569
01:24:04,709 --> 01:24:06,876
Thank you.
I'll be right down.

570
01:24:13,668 --> 01:24:14,959
Hello.

571
01:25:36,293 --> 01:25:38,084
Well...

572
01:25:38,168 --> 01:25:41,793
Vladimir Ivanovitch knew that
his death was approaching.

573
01:25:41,876 --> 01:25:47,084
I know how he wished to
dispose of his property.

574
01:25:47,168 --> 01:25:52,043
I visited him at the hospital,
at his request, and we discussed it.

575
01:25:52,126 --> 01:25:55,376
Unfortunately, we failed
to document his wishes in writing

576
01:25:55,459 --> 01:25:57,001
as required by law.

577
01:25:57,084 --> 01:26:01,168
I am therefore forced to
acknowledge the following.

578
01:26:02,584 --> 01:26:05,376
He did not leave a will,

579
01:26:05,459 --> 01:26:10,126
so the principle of legal succession
comes into force.

580
01:26:10,209 --> 01:26:15,543
First of all, I would like to advise
you that he left no debts.

581
01:26:15,626 --> 01:26:20,876
Otherwise, you would be liable
to any creditors for his debts.

582
01:26:21,876 --> 01:26:26,001
Further, it is my duty to
inform you that, under the law,

583
01:26:26,084 --> 01:26:30,251
should one spouse die,
the surviving spouse

584
01:26:30,334 --> 01:26:34,876
is entitled to a portion of the property
acquired during the marriage.

585
01:26:34,959 --> 01:26:38,626
That is, to their share
of the common property.

586
01:26:38,709 --> 01:26:42,043
The spouse also
inherits the portion

587
01:26:42,126 --> 01:26:45,209
of the property
acquired during the marriage,

588
01:26:45,293 --> 01:26:47,918
on an equal basis
with the other heirs.

589
01:26:48,001 --> 01:26:50,584
This portion is included
in the inheritance

590
01:26:50,668 --> 01:26:54,834
along with the personal
property of the deceased.

591
01:26:54,918 --> 01:26:58,209
However in this case,

592
01:26:58,293 --> 01:27:02,001
during the time
that you were married,

593
01:27:02,084 --> 01:27:04,584
which was just
over two years,

594
01:27:04,668 --> 01:27:08,918
no common property
was acquired.

595
01:27:09,001 --> 01:27:12,543
Therefore, there can be no talk
of a spousal share here.

596
01:27:12,626 --> 01:27:17,293
You will inherit a portion of
the property of the deceased

597
01:27:17,376 --> 01:27:19,876
on an equal
basis with Katya.

598
01:27:19,959 --> 01:27:24,251
Since, to the best of my knowledge,
there are no other heirs

599
01:27:24,334 --> 01:27:25,668
besides the two of you,

600
01:27:25,751 --> 01:27:30,501
the entire estate will be
equally divided between you.

601
01:27:33,334 --> 01:27:35,793
If anything is unclear,

602
01:27:35,876 --> 01:27:39,501
I can explain further.

603
01:27:39,584 --> 01:27:44,668
My father kept a sizeable amount
of cash in his safe at home.

604
01:27:44,751 --> 01:27:46,668
What happens to that?

605
01:27:46,751 --> 01:27:48,751
I already checked.
There's nothing.

606
01:27:48,834 --> 01:27:51,626
- Yeah, right!
- Believe me, Katya.

607
01:27:51,709 --> 01:27:55,668
- Of course. Anything else?
- We've only started.

608
01:27:55,751 --> 01:27:58,084
I've described the
overall situation.

609
01:27:58,251 --> 01:28:00,751
Let's look at the details.

610
01:28:03,001 --> 01:28:05,709
If you like,
we can take a break.

611
01:28:07,876 --> 01:28:10,209
No need, let's push on.

612
01:28:10,293 --> 01:28:13,084
- Right, Elena Anatolievna?
- Yes, let's carry on.

613
01:28:13,293 --> 01:28:16,168
OK.
Let's get started.

614
01:28:16,251 --> 01:28:18,543
So, how so we
carve up Dad's pad?

615
01:28:18,626 --> 01:28:20,001
According to the law.

616
01:29:50,168 --> 01:29:51,918
Look!

617
01:30:45,376 --> 01:30:46,751
That's that.

618
01:30:49,168 --> 01:30:50,501
Mum...

619
01:30:57,543 --> 01:30:59,543
We should drink to this!

620
01:30:59,626 --> 01:31:00,918
I agree.

621
01:31:01,001 --> 01:31:03,376
- Have we got anything?
- Of course we do.

622
01:31:03,459 --> 01:31:05,834
Well, come on then!

623
01:31:14,959 --> 01:31:17,043
Don't cry.
Mum will be right back.

624
01:31:37,584 --> 01:31:39,251
You know what?

625
01:31:40,709 --> 01:31:42,793
Let's drink to Vladimir.

626
01:31:43,626 --> 01:31:47,918
He did at least one
decent thing in his life.

627
01:31:51,209 --> 01:31:53,709
Let's drink to Sasha.

628
01:31:53,793 --> 01:31:55,251
Sasha!

629
01:31:57,418 --> 01:32:00,001
- What?
- Don't you "what" me. Get in here.

630
01:32:03,209 --> 01:32:04,543
College boy.

631
01:32:05,751 --> 01:32:07,251
Sit down.

632
01:32:08,334 --> 01:32:09,959
Here.

633
01:32:10,043 --> 01:32:12,126
You're definitely
going to college now.

634
01:32:12,209 --> 01:32:13,293
What the hell?

635
01:32:13,376 --> 01:32:17,334
What? I've got it under control.
The kid's 17 already.

636
01:32:17,876 --> 01:32:19,626
What, is this real?

637
01:32:20,293 --> 01:32:22,834
Never seen so much, eh?
Put it down.

638
01:32:22,918 --> 01:32:24,126
Damn!

639
01:32:24,709 --> 01:32:25,834
Alright!

640
01:32:27,084 --> 01:32:29,668
- To a new life.
- Mum...

641
01:32:30,584 --> 01:32:32,209
We have a surprise for you!

642
01:32:33,543 --> 01:32:35,543
We're pregnant again!

643
01:32:35,626 --> 01:32:37,459
Are you serious?

644
01:32:37,543 --> 01:32:40,626
- Really?
- Bless you.

645
01:32:40,709 --> 01:32:43,209
Goodness,
that's wonderful!

646
01:32:43,709 --> 01:32:46,376
If it's a boy,
I'll call him Vladimir.

647
01:32:46,459 --> 01:32:47,668
- Oh, please.
- Why not?

648
01:32:47,751 --> 01:32:49,459
Well, I hope it's a girl.

649
01:32:49,543 --> 01:32:51,418
Yeah, a girl would be better!

650
01:32:56,043 --> 01:32:57,501
Here, eat.

651
01:33:02,001 --> 01:33:05,043
- Go easy!
- Don't rain on my parade, woman!

652
01:33:07,209 --> 01:33:08,459
Game over.

653
01:33:08,626 --> 01:33:11,668
It's probably just
the circuit breaker.

654
01:33:11,834 --> 01:33:14,959
Mum, you're going
to break my arm.

655
01:33:15,043 --> 01:33:17,418
- Give him to me.
- I'll go and have a look.

656
01:33:19,668 --> 01:33:21,418
Easy, little one, easy...

657
01:33:35,084 --> 01:33:37,001
Looks like the
whole building's out.

658
01:33:37,084 --> 01:33:38,543
The whole world!

659
01:33:38,626 --> 01:33:40,793
Those assholes.

660
01:33:40,876 --> 01:33:43,126
- Hey, Alexei.
- Hey.

661
01:33:48,834 --> 01:33:51,418
- What's up with it?
- Fuck knows.

662
01:33:53,084 --> 01:33:57,168
The whole block's
been cut off.

663
01:33:59,168 --> 01:34:00,376
I guess...

664
01:34:01,001 --> 01:34:02,376
They'll turn it back on.

665
01:34:02,501 --> 01:34:04,626
Assholes. They cut it off
and we have to pay.

666
01:34:04,709 --> 01:34:06,709
Forget it, Sergei.

667
01:34:06,793 --> 01:34:08,876
Hi!

668
01:34:08,959 --> 01:34:10,668
Hey, you lot.

669
01:34:11,043 --> 01:34:13,918
- Where are you off to?
- For a walk.

670
01:34:14,001 --> 01:34:16,043
Be home by 11.

671
01:34:16,126 --> 01:34:18,168
Tanya, have we
got any candles?

672
01:34:18,251 --> 01:34:19,793
Why would we
have candles?

673
01:34:25,751 --> 01:34:29,001
Vitya? Lesha?
You there?

674
01:34:33,251 --> 01:34:34,376
Hey, guys.

675
01:34:34,459 --> 01:34:37,793
- What took you so long?
- My grandma's on my case.

676
01:34:37,876 --> 01:34:41,668
Thought you'd chickened out.
We almost went without you.

677
01:34:41,751 --> 01:34:44,918
- You should have, then. Shut it.
- Chill out.

678
01:34:45,001 --> 01:34:46,834
Here, drink up.

679
01:34:49,084 --> 01:34:50,876
Hey, leave some for us.

680
01:34:52,376 --> 01:34:54,251
Are they there?

681
01:34:54,334 --> 01:34:56,126
- Yeah.
- Let's go, then.

682
01:34:56,668 --> 01:34:57,793
Alright.

683
01:35:05,459 --> 01:35:07,126
Yuri, fucking hurry up!

684
01:35:24,293 --> 01:35:25,959
Slow down, fucker!

685
01:36:17,959 --> 01:36:19,168
Watch out!

686
01:36:38,126 --> 01:36:39,834
Kill him!

687
01:36:50,626 --> 01:36:52,709
Do him in!

688
01:37:23,334 --> 01:37:25,834
Die, fucker!

689
01:37:36,959 --> 01:37:38,376
Dima, let's go!

690
01:38:45,084 --> 01:38:47,043
How are you?

691
01:39:02,376 --> 01:39:04,334
- Mum!
- Quiet.

692
01:39:14,293 --> 01:39:16,209
What do we need
this crap for?

693
01:39:17,043 --> 01:39:21,584
If we put a wall in here,
Sasha could have his own room.

694
01:39:21,668 --> 01:39:23,876
We haven't decided
anything with Katya.

695
01:39:23,959 --> 01:39:26,043
We'll work something out.

696
01:39:26,126 --> 01:39:28,709
- I doubt it.
- We will, I'm telling you.

697
01:39:41,334 --> 01:39:43,751
Ma, have we got any beer?

698
01:39:43,834 --> 01:39:45,501
Look in the fridge.

699
01:39:57,584 --> 01:40:01,626
<i>I'm worried and I'm
waiting for his decision.</i>

700
01:40:02,709 --> 01:40:06,293
<i>I think it doesn't matter</i>

701
01:40:06,376 --> 01:40:09,001
<i>whose prize you are.</i>

702
01:40:09,084 --> 01:40:12,751
<i>He's got qualities I like.</i>

703
01:40:13,626 --> 01:40:17,334
<i>He leads an interesting life,
he's got kind eyes...</i>

704
01:40:29,001 --> 01:40:31,918
<i>Choose Katya or Dasha,
there's no difference,</i>

705
01:40:32,001 --> 01:40:34,334
<i>whichever one
takes your fancy.</i>

706
01:40:34,418 --> 01:40:36,251
<i>You will be a trophy!</i>

707
01:40:37,084 --> 01:40:41,126
<i>That was so cool.
You were better than all of them.</i>

708
01:40:41,209 --> 01:40:42,918
<i>Don't listen to anyone.</i>

709
01:40:43,001 --> 01:40:45,084
- Is he asleep?
- Yes.

710
01:40:45,793 --> 01:40:47,709
Elena Anatolievna,

711
01:40:47,793 --> 01:40:49,751
this is amazing!

712
01:40:51,751 --> 01:40:53,126
Tea, anyone?

713
01:40:54,584 --> 01:40:55,918
Let me help you.

714
01:40:58,834 --> 01:41:01,459
Tanya, bring me some nuts.

715
01:41:13,043 --> 01:41:17,084
<i>I feel like I'm 90 years old,
and I want to grumble</i>

716
01:41:17,168 --> 01:41:20,834
<i>because you're all younger than me,
except Leonid.</i>

717
01:41:20,918 --> 01:41:25,626
<i>I think that you're
empty-headed bimbos.</i>

718
01:41:25,709 --> 01:41:28,168
<i>Keep it in perspective
or you'll be sitting here</i>

719
01:41:28,251 --> 01:41:30,584
<i>until you're old enough
to draw your pension.</i>

720
01:41:30,668 --> 01:41:33,376
<i>She wants a lot,
but when it comes to giving...</i>

721
01:41:33,459 --> 01:41:36,126
<i>She doesn't know
what she's going to give yet.</i>

722
01:41:36,209 --> 01:41:38,543
<i>Zhenya, what did
you think of Lena?</i>

723
01:41:38,626 --> 01:41:40,584
<i>I don't know
what to tell you.</i>

724
01:41:40,709 --> 01:41:42,918
<i>Basically,</i>

725
01:41:43,084 --> 01:41:46,918
<i>there's nothing
I can say.</i>

726
