A FILM BY ANDREY ZVYAGINTSEV

3
00:00:32,816 --> 00:00:39,114
THE BANISHMENT

4
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,179
I'll call a doctor.

5
00:05:54,263 --> 00:05:56,015
No.

6
00:05:56,056 --> 00:06:00,811
- Mark, you need a doctor.
- Poke around and take the bullet out.

7
00:06:06,817 --> 00:06:09,111
You hear me?

8
00:06:09,153 --> 00:06:11,655
Take the bullet out and I'll leave.

9
00:06:11,739 --> 00:06:13,365
I'll sleep a little...

10
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,535
and leave.

11
00:06:16,619 --> 00:06:19,955
I don't want your family to see me.

12
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:24,793
Come on. Come on.

13
00:07:03,415 --> 00:07:05,084
How are you?

14
00:07:06,836 --> 00:07:09,672
- I'm leaving in a few days.
- For long?

15
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,425
For two months.

16
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,387
Robert found me a job.

17
00:07:16,428 --> 00:07:18,889
- Good money?
- It's OK.

18
00:07:31,402 --> 00:07:33,487
Maybe I'll finally buy a car.

19
00:07:35,364 --> 00:07:39,285
Why don't you sell Dad's house?
It's useless just standing there.

20
00:07:41,745 --> 00:07:43,914
Maybe. Maybe not.

21
00:07:43,956 --> 00:07:45,875
You want to go back there?

22
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:47,168
No.

23
00:12:40,002 --> 00:12:41,212
I'm thirsty.

24
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:45,299
We'll be there soon, hang on.

25
00:13:51,156 --> 00:13:53,033
Eva, come here.

26
00:13:58,581 --> 00:14:00,541
What, Mum?

27
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:03,252
Take these to your room
and put them on the bed.

28
00:14:07,631 --> 00:14:10,217
- Then come right back.
- OK.

29
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:33,003
Dad, where's the walnut garden?

30
00:17:34,547 --> 00:17:37,383
Up there on the hill.

31
00:17:39,176 --> 00:17:41,762
Will we go there
after we get washed?

32
00:17:41,804 --> 00:17:43,639
We'll go.

33
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:47,226
I want a nut from a tree.

34
00:17:47,268 --> 00:17:49,562
They're probably not ripe yet.

35
00:17:49,603 --> 00:17:51,897
They're more than ripe.

36
00:17:51,939 --> 00:17:54,316
I want a nut from the tree.

37
00:19:36,043 --> 00:19:39,797
Dad, why isn't the creek flowing?

38
00:19:40,673 --> 00:19:42,758
God only knows.

39
00:19:44,301 --> 00:19:45,886
Did it get dry?

40
00:19:45,928 --> 00:19:48,013
It dried up.

41
00:19:59,942 --> 00:20:06,198
It used to flow down here,
under the house, and to the ravine.

42
00:20:08,951 --> 00:20:10,703
Did you see it?

43
00:20:12,163 --> 00:20:14,165
I saw it.

44
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:25,634
Give me an apple, Bunny.

45
00:20:27,761 --> 00:20:30,097
My name is Eva.

46
00:20:30,139 --> 00:20:33,517
I know, I named you myself.

47
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:35,978
You said Bunny.

48
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:40,983
That's because you're a bunny,
a sunny bunny.

49
00:20:41,901 --> 00:20:43,903
My sunshine.

50
00:20:43,944 --> 00:20:46,864
I don't want to be Bunny,
I want to be Eva.

51
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,787
OK, Eva, pass me an apple.

52
00:21:00,127 --> 00:21:05,049
- You want an apple salad, don't you?
- No, I don't want it.

53
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:07,384
Then what do you want?

54
00:21:13,182 --> 00:21:14,934
Nothing.

55
00:21:54,223 --> 00:21:58,394
I'm so sorry, Mummy.
I won't do it again.

56
00:21:58,435 --> 00:22:02,106
Don't say that, darling,
it's not your fault.

57
00:22:06,402 --> 00:22:08,487
What's happened, Vera?

58
00:22:10,364 --> 00:22:12,283
What's happened?

59
00:22:13,033 --> 00:22:14,910
Nothing.

60
00:22:21,667 --> 00:22:23,335
I see.

61
00:23:12,801 --> 00:23:14,845
Well, off to bed?

62
00:23:14,887 --> 00:23:16,764
All right. Good night.

63
00:23:17,848 --> 00:23:21,852
Dad, what's that smell in the house?

64
00:23:21,894 --> 00:23:23,979
I don't know. what smell?

65
00:23:25,523 --> 00:23:28,067
- Go to bed.
- Good night.

66
00:23:43,374 --> 00:23:45,209
Want a drink?

67
00:23:47,711 --> 00:23:49,797
I'd love to get drunk.

68
00:24:48,355 --> 00:24:50,232
Alex.

69
00:24:56,405 --> 00:24:58,491
I'm expecting a child.

70
00:25:03,329 --> 00:25:05,414
It's not yours.

71
00:27:03,365 --> 00:27:05,451
Do you want a lift?

72
00:27:16,504 --> 00:27:18,589
I know you.

73
00:27:20,299 --> 00:27:21,842
You're Alexander.

74
00:27:21,884 --> 00:27:24,970
I'm Max, Georgy's son.

75
00:27:25,012 --> 00:27:27,056
Do you remember me?

76
00:27:27,097 --> 00:27:29,934
I'm a postman in the city.
I've been by your place.

77
00:27:29,975 --> 00:27:32,436
No, I don't remember.

78
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,606
Excuse me,
but I don't feel like talking.

79
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:13,644
- Hi.
- Hi.

80
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:32,663
Hello.

81
00:28:32,705 --> 00:28:37,376
Mark. I'm at the station.
We need to talk.

82
00:28:38,377 --> 00:28:40,212
Which station?

83
00:28:41,797 --> 00:28:44,341
- Well, talk.
- No, I'll come over.

84
00:28:45,426 --> 00:28:47,595
It's too late for a train.

85
00:28:48,888 --> 00:28:50,723
I'll find a car.

86
00:28:51,891 --> 00:28:54,977
well, all right.
I'll be downstairs in the bar.

87
00:28:55,019 --> 00:28:57,479
No, make it the casino.
It's next door.

88
00:28:57,521 --> 00:28:59,231
<i>I know.</i>

89
00:29:10,117 --> 00:29:12,328
Max, can I talk to you for a minute?

90
00:29:12,369 --> 00:29:13,829
Yes.

91
00:29:18,709 --> 00:29:20,794
Can I borrow your car until morning?

92
00:29:20,836 --> 00:29:22,421
Of course. Take it.

93
00:29:22,505 --> 00:29:24,131
Thank you.

94
00:29:24,173 --> 00:29:26,634
Where should I drop it off?
Over at your place?

95
00:29:26,675 --> 00:29:28,677
Yes.

96
00:29:28,719 --> 00:29:32,056
Just leave the keys
in the glove compartment.

97
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,323
Alex.

98
00:34:00,699 --> 00:34:02,409
Be quiet.

99
00:35:16,066 --> 00:35:17,693
Hello, Victor.

100
00:35:17,735 --> 00:35:20,029
It's Alexander.

101
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:22,656
Yes, we came yesterday.

102
00:35:22,698 --> 00:35:25,201
Probably for a week or so...

103
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:30,206
Yes, as we agreed.
Come today, at about five o'clock.

104
00:35:33,918 --> 00:35:35,794
Yes, yes, sure.

105
00:35:36,754 --> 00:35:39,048
Well, see you.

106
00:35:59,151 --> 00:36:01,111
How do you like it here?

107
00:36:01,195 --> 00:36:03,364
Has it changed much?

108
00:36:03,405 --> 00:36:05,115
It seems the same as before.

109
00:36:08,202 --> 00:36:11,080
Kir. Eva. Come here.

110
00:37:05,301 --> 00:37:09,054
How long since you were last here?
About ten years?

111
00:37:09,096 --> 00:37:10,681
Twelve.

112
00:37:11,557 --> 00:37:14,310
And how's Mark?

113
00:37:14,351 --> 00:37:16,729
Do you see your brother?

114
00:37:16,812 --> 00:37:18,898
He's fine.

115
00:37:18,939 --> 00:37:20,900
And his family?

116
00:37:20,983 --> 00:37:23,444
Does he at least see his children?

117
00:37:23,486 --> 00:37:25,446
I don't know.

118
00:37:25,488 --> 00:37:28,741
Your father missed them a lot.

119
00:37:29,825 --> 00:37:32,495
Has he even seen your kids?

120
00:37:32,536 --> 00:37:34,079
No.

121
00:37:36,415 --> 00:37:39,668
You can't drag a word out of Mark either.

122
00:37:39,752 --> 00:37:44,507
He comes, locks himself in the house,
and sits like a hermit.

123
00:37:47,551 --> 00:37:52,014
People were living,
everything seemed fine

124
00:37:52,097 --> 00:37:54,350
and just like that...

125
00:37:56,185 --> 00:37:58,979
You never know
what's waiting for you.

126
00:37:59,021 --> 00:38:02,274
Dad, I want to sit with you.

127
00:38:11,659 --> 00:38:13,869
Hang on a little,
we'll be there soon.

128
00:38:13,911 --> 00:38:15,996
We'll be there in three minutes.

129
00:38:27,258 --> 00:38:29,552
You can go over there.

130
00:38:33,222 --> 00:38:37,768
Kir, let's go, I want to
introduce you to somebody.

131
00:38:58,205 --> 00:39:00,082
What's his name?

132
00:39:00,124 --> 00:39:02,960
No name. Maybe you'll give him one?

133
00:39:05,963 --> 00:39:08,007
Can I ride him?

134
00:39:08,048 --> 00:39:11,677
Not yet. Let him grow a little.

135
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,014
When will he be big enough?

136
00:39:16,473 --> 00:39:19,977
I think by the next time you come here.

137
00:39:20,811 --> 00:39:23,898
- You like it here, don't you?
- Yes...

138
00:39:25,274 --> 00:39:29,904
- Good boy.
- Good boy.

139
00:39:35,409 --> 00:39:37,411
Let's go over to my place.

140
00:42:17,738 --> 00:42:19,573
Alex...

141
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:24,119
- I thought...
- You thought nothing.

142
00:42:36,674 --> 00:42:41,512
Listen, I really hoped
you'd be able to...

143
00:42:41,554 --> 00:42:44,348
Able to what? What?

144
00:42:46,809 --> 00:42:48,853
Do you love him?

145
00:42:53,232 --> 00:42:56,193
I don't know
how to explain it to you.

146
00:42:56,277 --> 00:42:58,737
You don't know?

147
00:42:58,821 --> 00:43:01,448
Don't know how to explain it to me?

148
00:43:33,522 --> 00:43:38,319
...27, 28, 29, 30.
Ready or not, here I come!

149
00:43:48,162 --> 00:43:51,665
- Eva's behind the tree!
- That's not fair! You peeked!

150
00:43:51,707 --> 00:43:53,584
I didn't!

151
00:43:53,626 --> 00:43:56,837
- It's still not fair!
- Get lost!

152
00:44:04,094 --> 00:44:08,182
No hiding in the house,
like we said.

153
00:44:27,326 --> 00:44:30,788
Faina! Faina!

154
00:44:33,791 --> 00:44:35,709
I'm first!

155
00:44:38,337 --> 00:44:40,172
Go and look for Flora.

156
00:44:40,214 --> 00:44:42,216
Flora will be ten soon,

157
00:44:42,258 --> 00:44:46,178
Frida is eleven, Faina is twelve.

158
00:44:46,262 --> 00:44:49,640
Mine wants more, but me...

159
00:44:49,682 --> 00:44:51,892
Yeah, give him a son.

160
00:44:52,726 --> 00:44:55,521
And how about you? Any plans?

161
00:44:55,604 --> 00:44:58,315
You should. At least one more.

162
00:44:58,357 --> 00:45:00,901
Three is a magic number.

163
00:45:12,997 --> 00:45:15,082
Flora...

164
00:45:22,089 --> 00:45:24,175
What's happening with dinner?

165
00:45:25,593 --> 00:45:28,762
- Vera?
- Yes, everything's ready.

166
00:45:28,804 --> 00:45:31,807
We just have to bring the table.

167
00:45:43,903 --> 00:45:47,323
- Why aren't you hiding?
- I am hiding.

168
00:45:47,364 --> 00:45:49,408
Doesn't look like it.

169
00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:51,827
You went too far.

170
00:45:51,911 --> 00:45:53,787
I know.

171
00:45:56,332 --> 00:46:00,753
- Don't you want to play?
- I do. But not always.

172
00:46:00,794 --> 00:46:04,173
Children, take your places
at the dinner table.

173
00:46:07,718 --> 00:46:09,595
Wanna go?

174
00:46:09,678 --> 00:46:11,764
I like it more here.

175
00:46:14,266 --> 00:46:16,852
- Do you like being by yourself?
- Yeah.

176
00:46:16,936 --> 00:46:18,646
Do you?

177
00:46:18,687 --> 00:46:20,898
Sometimes.

178
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:23,651
When I'm angry at somebody.

179
00:46:30,908 --> 00:46:32,993
Are you angry now?

180
00:46:34,286 --> 00:46:37,289
- Yeah, I'm angry.
- At who?

181
00:46:37,331 --> 00:46:38,999
At my dad.

182
00:46:39,959 --> 00:46:41,627
He hit my mum.

183
00:46:42,711 --> 00:46:45,256
When do you like to be alone?

184
00:46:45,297 --> 00:46:48,050
My dad never hits my mum.

185
00:46:49,176 --> 00:46:52,763
But sometimes Mum
really screams at him.

186
00:46:55,307 --> 00:46:57,768
And what does he do?

187
00:46:57,810 --> 00:47:01,063
He doesn't talk to her for a long time.

188
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:08,112
- Do you know why they do it?
- I don't know.

189
00:47:08,154 --> 00:47:11,866
I thought about it but I don't know.

190
00:47:19,748 --> 00:47:23,085
- Let's go back.
- All right.

191
00:47:34,430 --> 00:47:36,932
It must be hard for your dad
to be here alone.

192
00:47:37,016 --> 00:47:38,100
He's not alone.

193
00:47:38,142 --> 00:47:42,730
Besides, he sent me to the city.
He said, "Go and spread your wings."

194
00:47:42,771 --> 00:47:45,149
So, is it interesting being a postman?

195
00:47:45,191 --> 00:47:47,234
Everything is interesting to me.

196
00:47:47,276 --> 00:47:50,112
How do you mean "everything"?
Have you tried a lot?

197
00:47:50,154 --> 00:47:54,283
No, I mean in general.

198
00:47:57,786 --> 00:48:00,915
What's going on?

199
00:48:04,835 --> 00:48:07,129
What's going on?

200
00:48:11,550 --> 00:48:14,136
Can you tell me, Alex?

201
00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:20,226
Or you, Max?

202
00:48:20,267 --> 00:48:22,228
I see.

203
00:48:23,187 --> 00:48:28,150
You yourself know what is going on
and nobody else.

204
00:48:28,192 --> 00:48:30,110
Me?

205
00:48:30,152 --> 00:48:34,740
I don't know.

206
00:48:39,912 --> 00:48:43,874
But on the other hand, maybe I do.

207
00:48:47,169 --> 00:48:49,630
I've always known it.

208
00:48:51,048 --> 00:48:53,509
Yes, I know.

209
00:48:53,551 --> 00:48:57,096
If you know and I don't know,
then tell me.

210
00:48:59,473 --> 00:49:02,351
If you were living here,

211
00:49:02,434 --> 00:49:07,731
maybe I'd tell you something,

212
00:49:09,066 --> 00:49:10,526
a speck...

213
00:49:11,318 --> 00:49:13,404
Dad, when are we going home?

214
00:49:14,655 --> 00:49:16,699
I don't know.

215
00:49:18,576 --> 00:49:21,203
It's still early.
Go and play with the others.

216
00:49:21,245 --> 00:49:24,415
- I'm tired of playing.
- Go and play.

217
00:49:29,044 --> 00:49:33,174
How about that. She's tired.

218
00:49:42,391 --> 00:49:45,936
Three daughters.

219
00:49:45,978 --> 00:49:50,232
You might as well have
three more wives.

220
00:49:51,358 --> 00:49:53,819
Do you mind if I get drunk?

221
00:49:53,861 --> 00:49:58,491
- Don't, Liza. I'll do it myself.
- Vera, it's OK.

222
00:50:09,043 --> 00:50:11,086
Look.

223
00:50:13,964 --> 00:50:17,218
She can stand on her head

224
00:50:17,259 --> 00:50:21,055
that way for an hour

225
00:50:21,096 --> 00:50:23,182
if she wants.

226
00:50:49,792 --> 00:50:52,253
- Dad, get up.
- Yeah.

227
00:50:52,336 --> 00:50:55,923
Everything's fine.
Everything's under control.

228
00:50:59,093 --> 00:51:02,513
- Dad, get up.
- Kids, let's have some tea.

229
00:51:09,478 --> 00:51:12,148
<i>- Hello.
- Hi.</i>

230
00:51:12,189 --> 00:51:15,067
<i>- Hi.
- Let's meet.</i>

231
00:51:15,151 --> 00:51:17,862
<i>- Where are you?
- I'm at the station.</i>

232
00:51:19,238 --> 00:51:22,575
<i>- Come on over here.
- No, I won't.</i>

233
00:51:22,616 --> 00:51:26,662
<i>- We have guests.
- Georgy?</i>

234
00:51:26,704 --> 00:51:30,207
Yes, with Max. And Victor.

235
00:51:30,249 --> 00:51:33,794
<i>Take Georgy's car.
Come on, I'm waiting for you.</i>

236
00:51:33,836 --> 00:51:35,713
Well, all right.

237
00:51:52,813 --> 00:51:56,525
- Dad, who was it?
- Uncle Robert. Remember him?

238
00:51:56,567 --> 00:51:58,652
He's waiting for me at the station.
It's business.

239
00:51:58,694 --> 00:52:01,405
- Can I take your car?
- The keys are in the ignition.

240
00:52:01,489 --> 00:52:03,449
Why doesn't your friend come here?

241
00:52:03,491 --> 00:52:04,992
He doesn't know the way.

242
00:52:05,034 --> 00:52:07,953
- Dad, I want to go with you.
- Let's go.

243
00:52:07,995 --> 00:52:11,957
- I want to go too!
- No, sweetie. You stay here.

244
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:16,754
I'll go anyway.

245
00:52:20,132 --> 00:52:22,176
I said no.

246
00:52:47,993 --> 00:52:50,120
What does he want?

247
00:52:50,204 --> 00:52:53,082
- Who?
- Uncle Robert.

248
00:52:53,624 --> 00:52:58,212
Kir, we're really going
to meet Uncle Mark, not Robert.

249
00:53:00,089 --> 00:53:02,883
Then why did you say Robert first?

250
00:53:02,925 --> 00:53:05,010
I had to.

251
00:53:12,893 --> 00:53:15,312
Do you like him?

252
00:53:15,354 --> 00:53:17,273
Who?

253
00:53:17,314 --> 00:53:18,941
Uncle Robert.

254
00:53:20,526 --> 00:53:23,779
Of course. We're friends.
we work together. You know that.

255
00:53:23,821 --> 00:53:26,448
And I hate him.

256
00:53:26,532 --> 00:53:28,826
Hate him? Why?

257
00:53:29,785 --> 00:53:31,996
He was at our house.

258
00:53:32,705 --> 00:53:33,956
When?

259
00:53:34,039 --> 00:53:36,709
When you went to make money.

260
00:53:45,134 --> 00:53:47,636
Why didn't you tell me before?

261
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:50,097
I don't know.

262
00:53:56,520 --> 00:54:01,317
Mum said she'd take us to the circus,
but she changed her mind.

263
00:54:01,358 --> 00:54:03,486
Nina took us there instead.

264
00:54:03,569 --> 00:54:06,655
When we came back he was there.

265
00:54:52,868 --> 00:54:54,537
I waited for you until morning.

266
00:54:54,578 --> 00:54:56,664
You gambled until morning.

267
00:55:00,459 --> 00:55:02,503
I couldn't find a car.

268
00:55:09,176 --> 00:55:11,345
What happened?

269
00:55:13,889 --> 00:55:17,810
Vera's pregnant.
The child's not mine.

270
00:55:18,811 --> 00:55:22,148
She told me yesterday.

271
00:55:27,361 --> 00:55:29,780
What are you going to do?

272
00:55:29,864 --> 00:55:31,907
I'm scared I'll kill her.

273
00:55:35,661 --> 00:55:38,164
How far along is she?

274
00:55:38,205 --> 00:55:42,168
I don't know. Probably two months.

275
00:55:44,628 --> 00:55:46,714
My God.

276
00:55:51,969 --> 00:55:55,681
What's going on, Mark?
What is it with us?

277
00:55:55,723 --> 00:55:58,851
What's going on is what's going on.
It's a game.

278
00:55:58,893 --> 00:56:01,729
You play what you're dealt.

279
00:56:01,770 --> 00:56:05,774
I was sure she wanted
to get rid of it, same as me.

280
00:56:05,816 --> 00:56:08,903
And she's smiling. Can you imagine?

281
00:56:14,492 --> 00:56:16,702
What should I do, Mark?

282
00:56:17,828 --> 00:56:20,581
Whatever you do will be right.

283
00:56:23,792 --> 00:56:26,212
If you want to kill, kill.

284
00:56:27,254 --> 00:56:29,256
The gun's in the dresser upstairs.

285
00:56:29,298 --> 00:56:31,300
Then that's right.

286
00:56:32,551 --> 00:56:35,221
If you want to forgive, forgive.

287
00:56:36,388 --> 00:56:38,015
Then that's right.

288
00:56:38,098 --> 00:56:40,059
Just make a decision.

289
00:56:40,142 --> 00:56:42,186
What decision, Mark?

290
00:56:45,898 --> 00:56:49,026
I don't want to lose my kids like you.

291
00:56:53,197 --> 00:56:56,617
I can't believe it's happening to me.

292
00:56:57,701 --> 00:57:00,204
I didn't lose my kids.

293
00:57:01,163 --> 00:57:05,167
I just got myself used to the idea
that they don't exist.

294
00:57:06,168 --> 00:57:08,587
But they do. They're alive.

295
00:57:09,338 --> 00:57:11,632
And so?

296
00:57:11,757 --> 00:57:15,094
- Don't you want to know how they are?
- No.

297
00:57:17,179 --> 00:57:20,599
- And that's right, is it?
- That's right.

298
00:57:21,559 --> 00:57:24,061
That's my lot.

299
00:57:24,103 --> 00:57:26,272
No, I don't understand that.

300
00:57:28,649 --> 00:57:30,359
Then be so kind as to accept it.

301
00:57:30,401 --> 00:57:34,405
It's simple.
It's either heads or tails.

302
00:57:37,867 --> 00:57:41,495
I did gamble until morning

303
00:57:43,497 --> 00:57:45,457
but I was waiting for you too.

304
00:57:45,499 --> 00:57:46,917
- Take it.
- No.

305
00:57:46,959 --> 00:57:49,461
Take it. You'll need it.

306
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:57,803
So go to your boy.

307
00:57:57,845 --> 00:58:00,848
He's wilting.

308
00:58:05,686 --> 00:58:07,188
Are you sure?

309
00:58:07,229 --> 00:58:08,814
Yes.

310
00:58:08,856 --> 00:58:12,902
- About what?
- That you aren't kidding yourself.

311
00:58:19,158 --> 00:58:21,160
No.

312
00:58:23,037 --> 00:58:25,206
And that's right?

313
00:58:26,290 --> 00:58:28,459
Yeah, that's right.

314
00:58:37,426 --> 00:58:39,929
Kir, let's go.

315
00:58:57,530 --> 00:58:59,990
Are you sure you lost it here?

316
00:59:01,909 --> 00:59:03,661
Yeah.

317
00:59:03,702 --> 00:59:05,996
You left it at home.

318
00:59:07,081 --> 00:59:10,209
Here it is. I've found it!

319
00:59:35,818 --> 00:59:38,821
Mark smells the same
as in the house.

320
00:59:53,419 --> 00:59:56,255
Next time, you come to us. Any time.

321
00:59:56,297 --> 00:59:58,257
Yes, find the time.

322
00:59:58,299 --> 01:00:01,010
I'd be happy if you never left here.

323
01:00:01,051 --> 01:00:04,263
Of course. Where else
can you find such a sky?

324
01:00:04,305 --> 01:00:08,267
Alexander, move out here for good.

325
01:00:09,435 --> 01:00:11,187
No, I don't think so.

326
01:00:11,228 --> 01:00:13,063
Bye.

327
01:00:15,483 --> 01:00:17,568
Goodbye.

328
01:00:27,703 --> 01:00:29,788
I forgot.

329
01:00:45,930 --> 01:00:48,557
- Kir, aren't you tired?
- I'm tired.

330
01:00:48,641 --> 01:00:50,559
Go to bed.

331
01:01:29,682 --> 01:01:32,726
When you're finished,
I'd like to talk.

332
01:01:32,768 --> 01:01:34,770
The water's very loud.

333
01:01:37,606 --> 01:01:41,777
When you're finished,
I'd like to talk to you.

334
01:02:02,923 --> 01:02:05,259
I'm scared to talk to you.

335
01:02:07,553 --> 01:02:12,433
I'm scared to talk too,
but I think it's better to talk.

336
01:02:14,143 --> 01:02:15,978
OK.

337
01:02:48,135 --> 01:02:51,972
I know what kind of people
you and your brother are.

338
01:02:53,057 --> 01:02:56,185
- And what Kir will become.
- Vera...

339
01:03:03,567 --> 01:03:07,780
if you have any mercy for yourself,

340
01:03:07,822 --> 01:03:11,242
then know that I have mercy for both of us.

341
01:03:12,201 --> 01:03:14,286
Understand that.

342
01:03:15,162 --> 01:03:18,499
Let me help my son and my daughter.

343
01:03:20,626 --> 01:03:22,711
Let me help you.

344
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:29,552
This child...

345
01:03:30,636 --> 01:03:34,473
- Alex...
- I'm not interested in your child.

346
01:03:34,515 --> 01:03:38,227
I want to know,
what are you going to do with it?

347
01:04:03,711 --> 01:04:06,297
We're strangers to each other.

348
01:04:08,841 --> 01:04:11,302
You are a stranger,
always have been...

349
01:04:15,681 --> 01:04:17,266
and always will.

350
01:04:17,308 --> 01:04:20,186
What is this nonsense?

351
01:04:21,270 --> 01:04:24,148
Is it possible it needs to be that way?

352
01:04:25,774 --> 01:04:27,401
Is it possible it has to be that way?

353
01:04:27,443 --> 01:04:30,279
Vera, I don't want to shout at you.

354
01:04:31,363 --> 01:04:35,326
I don't want to hurt you.
I don't want to cause you pain.

355
01:04:35,367 --> 01:04:38,746
I just want to know
what you're going to do.

356
01:04:42,458 --> 01:04:46,045
You're in trouble, Vera.
Do you understand that?

357
01:04:49,715 --> 01:04:51,800
You're tired.

358
01:04:56,430 --> 01:04:59,141
Can you really be that tired?

359
01:05:03,771 --> 01:05:06,899
And what are you going to do?

360
01:05:11,904 --> 01:05:13,948
Sleep.

361
01:09:15,648 --> 01:09:17,358
Hello.

362
01:10:19,295 --> 01:10:23,465
All right, Vera, make us breakfast.

363
01:10:23,507 --> 01:10:25,593
We'll eat together.

364
01:10:28,512 --> 01:10:31,056
Be their mother and I'll be their father.

365
01:11:04,048 --> 01:11:06,175
- Eva, give it to me.
- I won't.

366
01:11:41,585 --> 01:11:44,421
Hello? Speak.

367
01:11:44,547 --> 01:11:47,508
<i>- Long distance. Is this 32-1510?
- Yes.</i>

368
01:11:47,550 --> 01:11:49,260
<i>It disconnected.</i>

369
01:11:49,301 --> 01:11:52,429
Miss, where was the call from?

370
01:11:52,471 --> 01:11:57,476
<i>From the city. 615-3018.
Would you like to call back?</i>

371
01:11:58,727 --> 01:12:02,439
<i>- Hello? Are you there?
- No, thank you.</i>

372
01:12:09,697 --> 01:12:11,532
Robert.

373
01:12:17,830 --> 01:12:20,124
Dad, who was it?

374
01:12:20,207 --> 01:12:22,793
Mark. Let's go.

375
01:13:19,099 --> 01:13:21,894
Was Grandfather like Georgy?

376
01:13:21,936 --> 01:13:23,896
What do you mean?

377
01:13:25,064 --> 01:13:27,525
Well... so old?

378
01:13:27,566 --> 01:13:29,693
No, he was younger.

379
01:13:32,988 --> 01:13:35,241
And why did he die?

380
01:13:36,659 --> 01:13:38,953
Everybody dies.

381
01:13:56,011 --> 01:14:02,643
Why doesn't Grandfather's stone
have writing like the others?

382
01:14:02,726 --> 01:14:05,563
I don't know.
It's probably what he wanted.

383
01:15:24,016 --> 01:15:25,434
Hello.

384
01:15:25,476 --> 01:15:27,102
<i>Flora?</i>

385
01:15:27,144 --> 01:15:31,982
<i>- No, it's Frida.
- It's Kir. What are you doing?</i>

386
01:15:32,024 --> 01:15:34,777
Well, we're at home doing nothing.

387
01:15:34,819 --> 01:15:38,781
<i>- Can I talk to Flora?
- Yes, hold on.</i>

388
01:15:38,823 --> 01:15:40,074
Flora!

389
01:15:41,116 --> 01:15:43,118
Phone for you.

390
01:15:44,995 --> 01:15:46,789
It's Kir.

391
01:15:49,250 --> 01:15:50,960
Hello.

392
01:15:51,502 --> 01:15:54,547
<i>- Kir?
- Hi, Flora.</i>

393
01:15:54,588 --> 01:15:56,090
Hi.

394
01:15:57,675 --> 01:15:59,218
<i>What are you doing?</i>

395
01:15:59,260 --> 01:16:03,180
Mum and Dad are going out
and we're staying with Grandma.

396
01:16:04,056 --> 01:16:05,808
Come over.

397
01:16:05,850 --> 01:16:07,935
Who's is it?

398
01:16:07,977 --> 01:16:10,604
It's Kir. Can they come to visit us?

399
01:16:10,646 --> 01:16:13,023
Sure. Give me the phone.

400
01:16:13,065 --> 01:16:15,025
Hi, Kir!

401
01:16:15,067 --> 01:16:17,403
Listen, is your dad around?
Put him on.

402
01:16:17,444 --> 01:16:19,196
But I wanted to talk to Flora.

403
01:16:19,238 --> 01:16:23,284
<i>I'll just say a couple of words to him
and give the phone back.</i>

404
01:16:23,325 --> 01:16:25,202
OK.

405
01:16:25,244 --> 01:16:27,746
Dad, it's for you.

406
01:16:34,461 --> 01:16:36,547
<i>- Hello.
- Hi, Alexanderl</i>

407
01:16:37,631 --> 01:16:41,051
Liza and I are going to the city.
Do you need anything?

408
01:16:41,093 --> 01:16:43,387
No, thank you.

409
01:16:44,221 --> 01:16:49,101
The girls said that maybe Kir and Eva
can come over to visit. We'd be happy.

410
01:16:49,143 --> 01:16:54,273
I'll pick them up
and bring them back tonight.

411
01:16:56,025 --> 01:16:58,027
Or even tomorrow.

412
01:16:58,986 --> 01:17:02,156
You and Vera can take a break from them.

413
01:17:02,198 --> 01:17:04,533
What do you say?

414
01:17:04,617 --> 01:17:07,286
<i>Until tomorrow? I doubt it.</i>

415
01:17:08,871 --> 01:17:11,999
- So am I coming or not?
- Hang on a second.

416
01:17:12,041 --> 01:17:15,586
Kir, do you want to go visit Flora?

417
01:17:15,628 --> 01:17:17,171
Yes.

418
01:17:18,255 --> 01:17:19,882
Eva!

419
01:17:19,965 --> 01:17:21,592
Yes, Daddy.

420
01:17:21,634 --> 01:17:24,386
Do you want to go and visit the girls?

421
01:17:24,470 --> 01:17:27,431
- Is Kir going?
- I'm going.

422
01:17:27,473 --> 01:17:30,059
<i>- Hello, Victor.
- I heard it all. I'm on my way.</i>

423
01:17:37,525 --> 01:17:39,360
<i>Hello. Speak, please.</i>

424
01:17:39,401 --> 01:17:42,154
Excuse me,
it seems I have the wrong number.

425
01:17:42,196 --> 01:17:44,323
<i>No. You just dialled a city number.</i>

426
01:17:44,406 --> 01:17:47,993
<i>You can only make a local call
directly from that line.</i>

427
01:17:48,035 --> 01:17:54,041
<i>You can call the city
on a pay phone at your train station,</i>

428
01:17:54,083 --> 01:17:56,544
<i>or through an operator.</i>

429
01:17:56,585 --> 01:17:58,337
Then an operator, please.

430
01:18:28,284 --> 01:18:29,785
Yes, hello?

431
01:18:29,827 --> 01:18:33,330
Robert... it's Vera.

432
01:18:33,372 --> 01:18:35,166
<i>Vera, hello.</i>

433
01:18:36,834 --> 01:18:39,295
<i>Is everything all right with you?</i>

434
01:18:40,296 --> 01:18:41,755
Yes.

435
01:18:45,301 --> 01:18:48,596
<i>I rang you earlier today.
Nobody answered.</i>

436
01:18:49,555 --> 01:18:51,348
No one was here.

437
01:18:58,147 --> 01:19:00,274
Are you sure everything's all right?

438
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:06,155
<i>Yes. Sorry, I don't even know why I called.</i>

439
01:19:08,365 --> 01:19:12,203
Vera, take care of yourself.

440
01:19:13,996 --> 01:19:16,248
Take care of your children.

441
01:19:16,290 --> 01:19:18,375
Thank you, Robert.

442
01:19:20,586 --> 01:19:22,671
Goodbye.

443
01:19:23,547 --> 01:19:25,424
<i>Goodbye.</i>

444
01:20:11,137 --> 01:20:13,722
They won't be back for a while.

445
01:20:14,849 --> 01:20:16,642
Let's go for a walk.

446
01:20:27,570 --> 01:20:30,281
We need to decide something.

447
01:20:31,323 --> 01:20:36,036
I don't want to talk about
betrayal or anything like that.

448
01:20:37,121 --> 01:20:39,623
I want to forget about all of this.

449
01:20:40,583 --> 01:20:42,793
Let's get rid of it.

450
01:20:43,878 --> 01:20:46,463
We have to do it, do you hear?

451
01:20:49,467 --> 01:20:51,927
There are more important things.

452
01:20:53,387 --> 01:20:56,390
Everything will be fine, Vera.

453
01:20:56,432 --> 01:20:58,517
We'll start again.

454
01:21:00,686 --> 01:21:03,022
We'll try.

455
01:21:04,523 --> 01:21:06,984
Why aren't you answering?

456
01:21:07,026 --> 01:21:09,612
Just do what you decided to do.

457
01:21:10,571 --> 01:21:12,907
I can't wait any longer.

458
01:21:50,069 --> 01:21:51,320
Hello.

459
01:21:52,321 --> 01:21:57,117
Connect me with the city, please.
643-1606.

460
01:21:59,745 --> 01:22:01,372
Yes, I'm waiting.

461
01:22:31,610 --> 01:22:34,572
Hello. Mark, it's me.

462
01:22:34,613 --> 01:22:39,243
If you know someone who does that,
bring him here today.

463
01:22:39,368 --> 01:22:41,287
Can you do that?

464
01:22:42,288 --> 01:22:44,206
OK. I'm waiting.

465
01:23:45,142 --> 01:23:47,603
<i>- Hello.
- Hi, it's me.</i>

466
01:23:47,645 --> 01:23:49,021
Yes, Mark.

467
01:23:49,063 --> 01:23:52,358
I found two.
The whole thing will take forty minutes.

468
01:23:52,399 --> 01:23:54,610
She'll be back on her feet
in about two days.

469
01:23:54,693 --> 01:23:57,363
<i>- In a month it will all be behind her.
- OK.</i>

470
01:24:03,619 --> 01:24:04,620
Yes?

471
01:24:04,703 --> 01:24:09,166
<i>Hello, Dad, can we stay?
It's so interesting here.</i>

472
01:24:09,208 --> 01:24:11,502
Uncle Victor can
bring us back tomorrow.

473
01:24:11,544 --> 01:24:13,921
<i>- Is he already back?
- Yes, he just got in.</i>

474
01:24:13,963 --> 01:24:15,339
<i>Put him on.</i>

475
01:24:15,381 --> 01:24:18,425
Please, Dad!
He's the one who offered.

476
01:24:18,467 --> 01:24:21,595
I'm fine with it
but first I'll talk to Uncle Victor.

477
01:24:22,429 --> 01:24:25,432
Uncle Victor,
my dad wants to talk to you!

478
01:24:25,474 --> 01:24:27,351
I'll be right there.

479
01:24:38,904 --> 01:24:40,114
Hello, Alexander.

480
01:25:14,565 --> 01:25:17,234
Give me that red piece.

481
01:27:03,507 --> 01:27:05,509
Frida.

482
01:27:23,319 --> 01:27:25,404
Read from here.

483
01:27:26,739 --> 01:27:30,784
"If I speak in the tongues
of men and of angels,

484
01:27:30,826 --> 01:27:32,411

01:27:57,895 --> 01:28:00,439
"but have not love,

493
01:28:00,523 --> 01:28:02,733
"I gain nothing.

494
01:28:02,817 --> 01:28:07,488
"Love is patient and kind.

495
01:28:07,530 --> 01:28:14,286
"Love does not envy or boast.
It is not arrogant or rude.

496
01:28:15,538 --> 01:28:19,917
"It does not insist on its own way.

497
01:28:19,959 --> 01:28:23,671
"It is not irritable or resentful.

498
01:28:23,712 --> 01:28:29,844
"It does not rejoice at wrongdoing,
but with the truth.

499
01:28:31,178 --> 01:28:34,473
"Love bears all things,
believes all things,

500
01:28:34,515 --> 01:28:38,727
"hopes all things,
endures all things."

501
01:29:34,950 --> 01:29:36,952
She'll sleep.

502
01:29:36,994 --> 01:29:40,122
Sometimes she'll wake up,
but not for long.

503
01:29:40,164 --> 01:29:43,751
She has to stay in bed until Thursday.
Then a month of rest.

504
01:29:43,792 --> 01:29:46,545
I left some painkillers there.
One pill after food.

505
01:29:46,629 --> 01:29:50,633
No more than three times a day.
If she has to, she can take two.

506
01:29:54,720 --> 01:29:56,931
There are instructions there.

507
01:29:58,599 --> 01:30:00,684
That seems to be it.

508
01:30:04,438 --> 01:30:06,732
I'll be back soon.

509
01:31:19,221 --> 01:31:21,474
Have you checked on her? How is she?

510
01:31:22,808 --> 01:31:24,894
Sleeping.

511
01:31:30,107 --> 01:31:32,735
She didn't make a sound

512
01:31:33,777 --> 01:31:36,697
even though she can't stand pain.

513
01:31:36,739 --> 01:31:41,619
Everything's fine.
He gave her painkillers. Don't worry.

514
01:31:44,288 --> 01:31:47,666
Don't you think I did
the right thing, Mark?

515
01:31:48,501 --> 01:31:50,085
Absolutely.

516
01:31:50,127 --> 01:31:53,214
Let's have some coffee.

517
01:32:36,006 --> 01:32:39,301
I don't like how she looks.

518
01:32:41,178 --> 01:32:43,264
Calm down.

519
01:32:43,597 --> 01:32:46,308
Go and look at her, please.

520
01:33:09,456 --> 01:33:11,917
I don't know,
I think everything's fine.

521
01:33:13,043 --> 01:33:15,421
Maybe we should wake her?

522
01:33:16,839 --> 01:33:18,632
Don't. Let her sleep.

523
01:33:21,302 --> 01:33:23,888
I'll stay here.

524
01:33:23,929 --> 01:33:25,973
I'll be in the kitchen.

525
01:33:55,878 --> 01:33:57,755
Vera.

526
01:34:02,468 --> 01:34:04,970
I'm terribly sorry.

527
01:34:09,183 --> 01:34:12,853
Don't make me regret even more.

528
01:34:18,442 --> 01:34:20,528
I made a mistake.

529
01:34:21,529 --> 01:34:23,614
I know it.

530
01:34:34,750 --> 01:34:39,088
Help me, Vera. Help me.

531
01:34:42,091 --> 01:34:44,093
She's dying.

532
01:34:45,928 --> 01:34:48,180
Pull yourself together.

533
01:34:48,222 --> 01:34:50,349
She's dying.

534
01:35:09,410 --> 01:35:12,997
- Who are you phoning?
- A local doctor, an old friend of mine.

535
01:35:13,038 --> 01:35:14,165
Why not an ambulance?

536
01:35:14,290 --> 01:35:17,293
Are you out of your mind?
Don't you understand the situation?

537
01:35:17,376 --> 01:35:20,629
- Hello, Gherman? It's Mark.
- To hell with the situation!

538
01:35:20,671 --> 01:35:22,214
I need your help.

539
01:35:23,174 --> 01:35:25,009
At my place.

540
01:35:25,050 --> 01:35:26,802
Yes, here.

541
01:35:27,845 --> 01:35:30,806
Come as soon as possible, friend.

542
01:35:30,848 --> 01:35:34,477
A woman after an abortion.
She's probably in a coma.

543
01:35:35,352 --> 01:35:37,313
A few hours ago.

544
01:35:40,357 --> 01:35:41,984
I'll be waiting.

545
01:35:46,822 --> 01:35:48,908
He'll be here soon.

546
01:36:28,531 --> 01:36:30,574
- Where?
- The bedroom.

547
01:37:04,692 --> 01:37:08,404
She needs a hospital.
I'll call an ambulance.

548
01:37:08,445 --> 01:37:11,157
- Let's take her ourselves.
- No.

549
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:13,742
- Mark...
- Why? What's the problem?

550
01:37:13,784 --> 01:37:16,162
Believe me,
it's better with an ambulance.

551
01:37:16,287 --> 01:37:18,539
Mark, we need to talk.

552
01:37:28,048 --> 01:37:29,717
She's dead.

553
01:37:31,594 --> 01:37:34,513
I'll report it as heart failure.

554
01:37:35,806 --> 01:37:40,102
I'm very sorry. My advice to you
is to look after your brother.

555
01:37:40,144 --> 01:37:42,229
He is your brother, isn't he?

556
01:37:43,189 --> 01:37:45,149
Poor girl.

557
01:38:14,887 --> 01:38:16,722
Alex...

558
01:38:22,186 --> 01:38:26,857
Quiet, Alex, calm down...

559
01:39:09,567 --> 01:39:12,570
- I have to tell you something.
- Later.

560
01:39:13,612 --> 01:39:15,281
It's important.

561
01:39:16,407 --> 01:39:19,076
Nothing's important any more.

562
01:40:56,048 --> 01:40:59,218
We need to iron out
the formalities quickly.

563
01:40:59,260 --> 01:41:04,098
Rumours fly around here
before anything even happens.

564
01:41:43,721 --> 01:41:45,639
Excuse me.

565
01:41:51,061 --> 01:41:53,647
The simplest coffin.

566
01:41:53,689 --> 01:41:55,983
The nightgown she is wearing.

567
01:41:56,025 --> 01:41:57,818
No make-up.

568
01:41:57,860 --> 01:41:59,987
Don't touch her at all.

569
01:42:00,029 --> 01:42:02,072
The funeral is tomorrow at noon.

570
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:14,502
I want to see her.

571
01:42:18,756 --> 01:42:20,800
I'll take you.

572
01:42:22,343 --> 01:42:23,928
This way.

573
01:43:12,184 --> 01:43:14,228
Start the car.

574
01:43:16,522 --> 01:43:20,234
She wanted to stay here
and I killed her.

575
01:43:21,443 --> 01:43:25,197
- I killed my wife.
- It was an accident.

576
01:43:27,825 --> 01:43:29,577
What have I done?

577
01:43:30,494 --> 01:43:34,623
Let's not talk about what's done,
but what needs to be done.

578
01:43:38,836 --> 01:43:41,046
What needs to be done?

579
01:43:41,088 --> 01:43:43,132
To bury Vera.

580
01:43:52,558 --> 01:43:55,227
Damn you, Mark.

581
01:43:56,562 --> 01:43:58,063
Start the car.

582
01:44:45,110 --> 01:44:46,946
Mark.

583
01:44:48,155 --> 01:44:49,198
Mark.

584
01:44:58,624 --> 01:45:03,170
I have to get up tomorrow
for a few hours.

585
01:45:03,838 --> 01:45:05,923
That's out of the question.

586
01:45:08,300 --> 01:45:11,929
Don't even think about calling an ambulance.

587
01:45:11,971 --> 01:45:13,681
I won't go anyway.

588
01:45:13,722 --> 01:45:16,225
I'll do what I have to do.

589
01:45:17,268 --> 01:45:19,311
You owe me.

590
01:45:25,609 --> 01:45:27,444
Fine.

591
01:45:28,779 --> 01:45:30,906
You're the king of the castle.

592
01:45:31,907 --> 01:45:34,034
Call my brother.

593
01:45:35,369 --> 01:45:37,830
Don't say too much.

594
01:45:43,586 --> 01:45:45,880
Mark needs you for a minute.

595
01:45:45,963 --> 01:45:48,632
He's much worse than he thinks.

596
01:45:57,766 --> 01:46:01,103
- Phone Victor and tell him...
- I already have.

597
01:46:02,062 --> 01:46:04,064
How are the kids?

598
01:46:04,732 --> 01:46:07,485
They don't know anything yet.

599
01:46:07,526 --> 01:46:09,195
That's right.

600
01:46:10,488 --> 01:46:13,115
You have to tell them everything yourself.

601
01:46:14,700 --> 01:46:17,495
Don't worry, I know what to do.

602
01:46:18,162 --> 01:46:19,997
That's good.

603
01:46:31,842 --> 01:46:34,553
Why didn't they tell me anything?

604
01:46:34,595 --> 01:46:38,557
They had to have seen that
something was wrong with her.

605
01:47:02,373 --> 01:47:05,334
I tried to tell you before.

606
01:47:06,669 --> 01:47:10,589
I have a feeling
she died from something else.

607
01:47:12,508 --> 01:47:16,303
Opiates. Very strong stuff.

608
01:47:17,179 --> 01:47:20,307
A few tablets are enough
never to wake up again.

609
01:47:20,349 --> 01:47:22,643
It looks like she took them all.

610
01:47:22,685 --> 01:47:24,478
Are you sure?

611
01:47:25,396 --> 01:47:28,482
We could only say for sure
after an autopsy.

612
01:47:28,524 --> 01:47:30,985
- There won't be an autopsy.
- Right.

613
01:47:31,026 --> 01:47:36,907
There are some very general
morphological changes.

614
01:47:36,949 --> 01:47:40,911
The same as could have come
from an overdose of anaesthesia.

615
01:47:40,953 --> 01:47:44,957
But then it's odd that they
didn't try to resuscitate her.

616
01:47:45,040 --> 01:47:48,878
They were absolutely calm
and said she would sleep.

617
01:47:51,088 --> 01:47:53,632
That means everything was normal.

618
01:47:54,175 --> 01:47:57,928
They did everything, woke her up,
and made sure she was fine.

619
01:47:57,970 --> 01:48:00,264
And later, she...

620
01:48:00,306 --> 01:48:01,974
I don't know.

621
01:48:02,016 --> 01:48:04,059
And one more thing.

622
01:48:07,855 --> 01:48:10,191
I found it next to her.

623
01:48:23,704 --> 01:48:26,874
It's a pregnancy test.
On the other side.

624
01:49:00,324 --> 01:49:02,785
Will you tell him?

625
01:49:10,334 --> 01:49:12,294
No.

626
01:50:32,458 --> 01:50:34,502
You can't get up.

627
01:50:37,671 --> 01:50:42,802
Give me something
so I can get through three hours.

628
01:50:45,513 --> 01:50:49,433
- You are not allowed to get up.
- Give me something.

629
01:50:55,064 --> 01:51:00,236
- You don't understand the situation.
- I just have to go.

630
01:51:05,991 --> 01:51:07,993
Then I'll go with you.

631
01:51:08,035 --> 01:51:12,206
No. It's our own business.

632
01:52:23,736 --> 01:52:27,656
It's possible he'll need emergency help.
I'll be here.

633
01:55:17,159 --> 01:55:20,412
It's for Mark.
Please take care of him.

634
02:04:32,631 --> 02:04:34,300
Alex?

635
02:04:35,926 --> 02:04:37,928
What are you doing here?

636
02:04:39,889 --> 02:04:42,016
Let's go to the house.

637
02:07:42,530 --> 02:07:43,781
Hello.

638
02:07:44,865 --> 02:07:46,617
Hello.

639
02:07:57,294 --> 02:08:00,714
Vera, just don't sleep.

640
02:08:01,757 --> 02:08:04,635
Try not to sleep.
Do you hear me?

641
02:08:04,677 --> 02:08:06,637
I'll be there soon.

642
02:08:07,471 --> 02:08:10,391
Leave the door open, understand?

643
02:08:11,600 --> 02:08:13,060
Do you hear?

644
02:08:13,102 --> 02:08:14,979
I'll be right there.

645
02:09:09,408 --> 02:09:11,869
Vera! Vera!

646
02:09:57,414 --> 02:09:59,875
Drink.

647
02:10:50,676 --> 02:10:54,638
It's cold. I'll make some more.

648
02:11:07,026 --> 02:11:08,694
Robert.

649
02:11:09,862 --> 02:11:12,740
Promise you won't tell him.

650
02:11:24,043 --> 02:11:26,712
Where are the children?

651
02:11:26,754 --> 02:11:29,131
They're sleeping over at Nina's.

652
02:11:37,348 --> 02:11:39,099
Robert.

653
02:11:43,771 --> 02:11:45,856
Promise me.

654
02:11:48,400 --> 02:11:50,110
I promise.

655
02:12:08,170 --> 02:12:10,256
It's already dawn.

656
02:13:17,698 --> 02:13:19,533
Thank you.

657
02:13:30,377 --> 02:13:32,171
Mum, who was here?

658
02:13:32,254 --> 02:13:35,299
- They brought a letter.
- From Dad?

659
02:13:35,341 --> 02:13:36,926
No.

660
02:13:36,967 --> 02:13:38,552
From who?

661
02:13:38,594 --> 02:13:41,972
Mummy, he tore off Linda's head!

662
02:13:43,015 --> 02:13:44,391
Why did you do that?

663
02:13:44,433 --> 02:13:46,393
I wanted to see what she had inside.

664
02:13:48,020 --> 02:13:50,856
- And?
- Nothing.

665
02:13:50,898 --> 02:13:54,026
What did you think you'd see?

666
02:13:58,656 --> 02:14:01,117
Mum, it's just a doll.

667
02:14:02,451 --> 02:14:05,830
He also said that there wouldn't
be clowns at the circus.

668
02:14:05,871 --> 02:14:08,499
- I don't want it without clowns.
- Don't lie!

669
02:14:08,541 --> 02:14:12,253
- I said clowns weren't the best part
- All right, go and play.

670
02:15:48,015 --> 02:15:49,058
Hello.

671
02:15:49,099 --> 02:15:50,559
Hi, it's Robert.

672
02:15:52,895 --> 02:15:54,855
How are you?

673
02:15:54,897 --> 02:15:56,899
<i>Honestly, not great.</i>

674
02:15:56,941 --> 02:16:01,904
We were going to the circus
but I started feeling sick.

675
02:16:02,863 --> 02:16:06,617
I had to ask Nina to take the kids.

676
02:16:07,827 --> 02:16:12,414
<i>- Do you want me to come over?
- You'll come over?</i>

677
02:16:12,456 --> 02:16:13,707
Yes.

678
02:16:38,482 --> 02:16:42,903
The other day I lost the keys
to my apartment.

679
02:16:42,945 --> 02:16:45,823
The owner's on the other side of town.

680
02:16:45,865 --> 02:16:48,075
I figured he's got a copy.

681
02:16:49,493 --> 02:16:51,704
But I just couldn't
remember his number.

682
02:16:51,745 --> 02:16:54,248
It was in my phone book inside the flat.

683
02:16:55,082 --> 02:16:57,835
So I went to the bar

684
02:16:57,877 --> 02:16:59,170
and drank.

685
02:16:59,211 --> 02:17:01,172
Then I drank some more.

686
02:17:01,213 --> 02:17:03,674
And you found your keys
at the bottom of your glass.

687
02:17:03,757 --> 02:17:05,885
Exactly. How did you know?

688
02:17:05,926 --> 02:17:09,597
- You're lying.
- No, it's true.

689
02:17:09,638 --> 02:17:14,185
I just remembered his number.
It just popped up.

690
02:17:19,106 --> 02:17:21,817
I've never lost my keys.

691
02:17:22,735 --> 02:17:25,196
I envy you.

692
02:17:25,237 --> 02:17:27,865
But you have time.

693
02:17:31,702 --> 02:17:34,079
What's the matter, Vera?

694
02:17:34,163 --> 02:17:37,625
Everything's fine.
It'll pass in a minute.

695
02:17:37,666 --> 02:17:39,376
You don't feel well?

696
02:18:04,568 --> 02:18:08,155
Vera, maybe some water?

697
02:18:08,197 --> 02:18:10,699
No, I'm already better.

698
02:18:11,784 --> 02:18:14,328
Stay a bit if you can.

699
02:18:14,954 --> 02:18:17,123
Until they get back.

700
02:18:18,124 --> 02:18:20,209
I don't want to be alone.

701
02:18:21,252 --> 02:18:22,795
OK.

702
02:18:28,384 --> 02:18:31,262
I'll get up now and we'll have some coffee.

703
02:18:31,303 --> 02:18:33,639
No, lie down. I'll do it.

704
02:19:01,459 --> 02:19:03,919
Want to look at our photos?

705
02:19:04,920 --> 02:19:08,007
- You haven't seen them, have you?
- No.

706
02:19:08,048 --> 02:19:10,176
There, on the bottom shelf.

707
02:19:24,398 --> 02:19:26,609
That's his father.

708
02:19:30,780 --> 02:19:33,365
There are the three of them -

709
02:19:35,284 --> 02:19:41,207
father, Alex, and Mark.

710
02:19:46,462 --> 02:19:49,089
This is Mark with his family.

711
02:19:53,636 --> 02:19:55,971
This is my mum.

712
02:20:00,476 --> 02:20:03,437
Here Eva's not even a year old.

713
02:20:07,149 --> 02:20:10,986
And that's me before I got married.

714
02:20:13,656 --> 02:20:16,408
See, everything is disorganised.

715
02:20:16,450 --> 02:20:18,911
There's no time to deal with it.

716
02:20:22,915 --> 02:20:26,460
This is Alex taking me home
from the maternity ward.

717
02:20:36,679 --> 02:20:38,180
Vera...

718
02:20:41,642 --> 02:20:44,979
Why did you want to do that yesterday?

719
02:20:46,480 --> 02:20:48,399
I'm scared.

720
02:20:51,277 --> 02:20:54,572
I can't explain anything to him.

721
02:20:54,613 --> 02:20:56,449
To Alex?

722
02:20:58,367 --> 02:21:00,035
I'm pregnant.

723
02:21:00,953 --> 02:21:02,746
Pregnant?

724
02:21:06,667 --> 02:21:12,006
Excuse me, but the child...
It's not Alex's?

725
02:21:12,047 --> 02:21:14,341
It's his child.

726
02:21:17,595 --> 02:21:19,054
And not his.

727
02:21:20,055 --> 02:21:21,932
What do you mean?

728
02:21:23,225 --> 02:21:26,353
It's his child, of course it's his.
Who else's?

729
02:21:29,982 --> 02:21:35,070
But not his, in the respect
that our children are not ours.

730
02:21:35,154 --> 02:21:37,490
Rather, not only ours.

731
02:21:37,531 --> 02:21:42,203
Just like we're not our parents' children.
Not only theirs.

732
02:21:42,244 --> 02:21:43,788
Understand?

733
02:21:53,297 --> 02:21:57,676
I wake up at night and can't sleep...

734
02:22:00,221 --> 02:22:02,890
listening to how he breathes.

735
02:22:04,141 --> 02:22:07,686
He only loves us for himself.
Like things.

736
02:22:08,687 --> 02:22:14,151
God, it's been years already
living like that.

737
02:22:16,612 --> 02:22:18,656
Why am I so lonely?

738
02:22:18,697 --> 02:22:21,784
Why doesn't he talk to me any more
like he used to?

739
02:22:21,826 --> 02:22:24,787
Or maybe it just seemed
like we were talking.

740
02:22:25,704 --> 02:22:28,624
I won't be able
to explain anything to him.

741
02:22:28,666 --> 02:22:30,709
I have to do something.

742
02:22:31,627 --> 02:22:34,755
If it continues like this
everything will die.

743
02:22:34,797 --> 02:22:37,174
I don't want to give birth to the dying.

744
02:22:38,092 --> 02:22:41,262
We can live without dying.

745
02:22:41,303 --> 02:22:44,098
There is this possibility.

746
02:22:44,140 --> 02:22:49,061
- What possibility, Vera?
- I don't know, but I know it exists.

747
02:22:49,103 --> 02:22:53,607
And it's only possible together,
one for another, together.

748
02:22:53,691 --> 02:22:55,860
It's impossible one by one.

749
02:22:55,901 --> 02:22:59,238
There's no point.
It's a vicious circle.

750
02:23:00,739 --> 02:23:02,867
How can I explain it to him,

751
02:23:03,993 --> 02:23:08,289
so he can see what he's doing
and understand?

752
02:23:11,792 --> 02:23:14,378
Mum, we're back!

753
02:23:18,632 --> 02:23:20,843
Why is he sitting here?

754
02:23:21,927 --> 02:23:24,346
Why isn't he at his own house?

755
02:23:25,514 --> 02:23:28,225
Kir, how can you behave like that?

756
02:23:30,936 --> 02:23:33,147
Nina, I'll be right there.

757
02:23:39,445 --> 02:23:41,197
Excuse me, Robert.

758
02:23:41,238 --> 02:23:42,990
Don't worry.

759
02:23:51,582 --> 02:23:53,542
I should probably go.

760
02:24:38,796 --> 02:24:42,842
Give me 32-4311, please.

761
02:24:45,302 --> 02:24:49,557
Hello, Victor, it's Alexander.
How are you all doing?

762
02:24:51,892 --> 02:24:54,436
I'll pick up my kids today.

763
02:24:54,478 --> 02:24:57,481
Tell them when they wake up.

764
02:24:57,523 --> 02:25:01,026
I'm calling from the city.
I'll be there soon.
