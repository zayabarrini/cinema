1
00:01:04,499 --> 00:01:08,291
LEVIATHAN

2
00:06:10,994 --> 00:06:13,702
I'll have a smoke outside,
or I'll fall asleep.

3
00:06:13,869 --> 00:06:15,369
OK. I'll be quick.

4
00:06:32,119 --> 00:06:33,619
There they are...

5
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,160
Not making your quota, Sergeant?

6
00:06:52,285 --> 00:06:53,785
Your license and registration.

7
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:56,660
Polished your badge today?

8
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,868
Stepanych will come see you today.
His carburettor broke again.

9
00:07:03,993 --> 00:07:06,952
Again? I'm not a charity.

10
00:07:07,077 --> 00:07:08,701
You know he'll make it up to you.

11
00:07:08,826 --> 00:07:11,201
I can buy my own damn vodka.

12
00:07:11,993 --> 00:07:13,076
Look,

13
00:07:13,826 --> 00:07:17,076
he said he'll cover everything
for our trip: petrol,

14
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,285
food, guns.

15
00:07:18,451 --> 00:07:20,451
I'm so excited,
I could wet my pants!

16
00:07:20,576 --> 00:07:22,368
- Kolya...
- Pasha.

17
00:07:22,451 --> 00:07:24,910
- It'll only take a second.
- I'm serious.

18
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:27,243
I can't today.

19
00:07:27,326 --> 00:07:29,243
Tell him to come tomorrow.

20
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:33,034
- I will.
- All right.

21
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:34,534
Say hi to the wife.

22
00:07:43,784 --> 00:07:46,576
I'm sick of that Stepanych
and his truck.

23
00:07:46,701 --> 00:07:47,951
Fucking cop...

24
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:53,492
Cheap bastard is always after me
to fix his rust bucket.

25
00:07:53,992 --> 00:07:57,492
He can crawl around
underneath it himself.

26
00:07:58,326 --> 00:08:02,159
Any corrupt traffic cop can afford
a good car after 5 years on the job.

27
00:08:02,284 --> 00:08:03,909
Maybe he's an honest cop.

28
00:08:04,034 --> 00:08:06,159
Yeah, and generous!

29
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:22,242
- Are they here yet?
- Nope.

30
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,408
And where's your "good morning"?

31
00:08:38,075 --> 00:08:39,575
I don't know.

32
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,867
Look for it, then.

33
00:08:43,742 --> 00:08:44,825
Where?

34
00:08:48,825 --> 00:08:51,992
Did you wash?
Go on, don't be an ape.

35
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:54,991
You're the ape.

36
00:08:55,075 --> 00:08:56,241
What?

37
00:08:57,158 --> 00:08:58,200
Nothing.

38
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:04,366
- Stop right there.
- Get lost.

39
00:09:04,491 --> 00:09:07,158
- What did you say?
- Just what you heard.

40
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,491
Oh! They're here.

41
00:09:29,366 --> 00:09:33,074
Dima, tell them to take me along.

42
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:37,699
What about school?
You have a test coming up. Go get ready.

43
00:09:37,824 --> 00:09:38,866
Don't lie...

44
00:09:38,991 --> 00:09:42,032
- Don't talk to your mum like that!
- She's not my mum!

45
00:09:54,949 --> 00:09:56,782
Difficult age...

46
00:09:57,574 --> 00:09:58,907
You shouldn't hit him.

47
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:01,157
Just an affectionate slap.

48
00:10:01,282 --> 00:10:03,532
I'm not driving him to school today.

49
00:10:03,657 --> 00:10:06,490
He's been rude to me all morning.

50
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:10,032
I can't either. My friend's here.

51
00:10:10,532 --> 00:10:14,407
He's your son. Up to you
whether he becomes a man or an ape.

52
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:17,740
Does he really have a test today?

53
00:10:18,615 --> 00:10:19,740
Yes.

54
00:10:21,032 --> 00:10:24,157
Kolya, just take him.
I can come along too.

55
00:10:25,448 --> 00:10:27,532
He'd like that.

56
00:10:35,448 --> 00:10:38,531
Hey, soldier of fortune,
you ready to go?

57
00:10:44,406 --> 00:10:45,906
How've you been?

58
00:10:46,031 --> 00:10:47,240
All right.

59
00:10:51,906 --> 00:10:53,823
We're looking for a new place.

60
00:10:55,365 --> 00:10:57,823
I've been saying
we should move out of town.

61
00:10:58,906 --> 00:11:01,406
Away from this place.
He says nothing.

62
00:11:01,573 --> 00:11:04,489
- Could you talk to him?
- Sure.

63
00:11:04,573 --> 00:11:06,073
Can't I just wear it?

64
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:08,198
Give it back, Dad.

65
00:11:08,364 --> 00:11:10,739
All right, I'll give it back.
Stop whining.

66
00:11:10,864 --> 00:11:11,864
Thank you.

67
00:11:15,531 --> 00:11:17,031
Go start the car.

68
00:11:17,156 --> 00:11:18,531
You're driving.

69
00:11:18,697 --> 00:11:19,822
Alone?

70
00:11:20,364 --> 00:11:22,739
You wish.

71
00:11:22,864 --> 00:11:25,197
Dima and I are coming too.

72
00:11:26,947 --> 00:11:29,364
- But I'm driving, right?
- Yes, you.

73
00:11:33,947 --> 00:11:35,364
Time out!

74
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:44,030
My own fault for coaching him.

75
00:11:46,364 --> 00:11:48,989
A couple more years,
and he'll knock you out cold.

76
00:11:49,905 --> 00:11:51,364
It's all good.

77
00:11:57,072 --> 00:11:59,239
- I love you.
- I know.

78
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,488
Don't let him drive too fast!

79
00:12:30,571 --> 00:12:31,571
Hello.

80
00:12:31,655 --> 00:12:34,530
Hi. Kolya's taking Roma to school.

81
00:12:34,613 --> 00:12:36,030
Come in. He'll be back soon.

82
00:12:36,113 --> 00:12:41,363
That's OK, I'll wait out here
and have a smoke.

83
00:13:35,112 --> 00:13:36,529
Hello, Kolya.

84
00:13:36,654 --> 00:13:38,695
Hey there. Car troubles again?

85
00:13:39,862 --> 00:13:42,487
Didn't Pasha tell you
that I can't today?

86
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,029
No. Why, what's up?

87
00:13:44,195 --> 00:13:46,862
My friend is visiting from Moscow.

88
00:13:46,987 --> 00:13:48,695
My court hearing is at noon,

89
00:13:48,778 --> 00:13:52,028
and we still have
a few things to go over.

90
00:13:55,695 --> 00:13:57,320
I'll do it tomorrow.

91
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:58,737
Come by in the morning.

92
00:13:58,862 --> 00:14:00,028
Tomorrow?

93
00:14:01,153 --> 00:14:02,987
- I'm Ivan Stepanych.
- Dima.

94
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:05,695
I promise. I'll fix her up -
good as new.

95
00:14:06,945 --> 00:14:09,070
OK, Kolya, fair enough.

96
00:14:09,195 --> 00:14:10,986
Tomorrow it is then.

97
00:14:14,736 --> 00:14:16,195
He wasn't happy about that.

98
00:14:18,528 --> 00:14:20,736
- Funny character.
- You think?

99
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,986
He's outlived two wives.

100
00:14:24,153 --> 00:14:25,486
Fucking tyrant.

101
00:14:28,403 --> 00:14:30,403
OK, my friends.

102
00:14:32,403 --> 00:14:34,903
Over the last two months,
I dug up some dirt

103
00:14:35,528 --> 00:14:37,028
on that bastard.

104
00:14:37,153 --> 00:14:38,611
Got him by the balls?

105
00:14:38,694 --> 00:14:40,653
Yep, it'll do some damage.

106
00:14:40,778 --> 00:14:44,653
- Doesn't look like much.
- So what now, how does it help?

107
00:14:44,736 --> 00:14:46,069
Here's the deal:

108
00:14:46,778 --> 00:14:49,152
I think today's ruling
won't be in our favour...

109
00:14:49,277 --> 00:14:52,152
- Don't write us off yet.
- But...

110
00:14:52,652 --> 00:14:56,444
We need him to think
what's best for him:

111
00:14:56,611 --> 00:14:58,402
settle with us, or we go public.

112
00:14:58,527 --> 00:15:00,527
- Meaning?
- Kolya, let him finish.

113
00:15:00,652 --> 00:15:04,486
I want to know what he found.
A cannon can't bring that prick down!

114
00:15:04,611 --> 00:15:06,611
No need for cannons.

115
00:15:06,736 --> 00:15:09,069
We'll just gently tug him

116
00:15:09,152 --> 00:15:10,360
by the balls.

117
00:15:10,485 --> 00:15:13,777
I don't believe in that approach.
We've got to crush him.

118
00:15:15,402 --> 00:15:17,194
- With a sledgehammer!
- No.

119
00:15:17,319 --> 00:15:19,610
Only a subtle approach
works with his kind.

120
00:15:19,735 --> 00:15:21,944
This here is our leverage. Facts.

121
00:15:22,027 --> 00:15:24,485
- Let me see.
- Not just yet.

122
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:26,152
After the hearing.

123
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:28,943
- Why's that?
- Kolya...

124
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:31,777
Because you're a hothead.
No offense,

125
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,610
but you can fly off the handle
just like that.

126
00:15:34,735 --> 00:15:37,527
And the last thing we need now
is a scandal.

127
00:15:38,235 --> 00:15:40,360
Come on. I'm not crazy.

128
00:15:40,443 --> 00:15:44,610
I have to know. You think
I'll just blurt out everything in court?

129
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:47,485
- Do you trust me, bro?
- Of course.

130
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:50,151
Then don't question me -
read it after.

131
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:54,901
Lilya, how about some tea?

132
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,985
Well, all right. I'll read it after.

133
00:16:05,568 --> 00:16:06,818
Good man.

134
00:16:07,485 --> 00:16:11,068
But you know,
you're bossing me around, junior.

135
00:16:11,193 --> 00:16:12,901
And I don't like it.

136
00:16:13,401 --> 00:16:16,943
Kolya, "junior" is what I was
in the army 20 years ago.

137
00:16:17,026 --> 00:16:18,193
Why are you

138
00:16:18,318 --> 00:16:21,443
waving these papers in my face then?

139
00:16:21,526 --> 00:16:24,859
See for yourself then, chief.

140
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:29,026
Well, I've heard things about him.
Who hasn't, around here?

141
00:16:29,734 --> 00:16:32,026
He's got blood dripping...

142
00:16:33,484 --> 00:16:35,567
from his hands.

143
00:16:35,692 --> 00:16:38,484
So why isn't he in prison
if you've got all this documented?

144
00:16:38,609 --> 00:16:41,234
Because somebody up top needs him.

145
00:16:41,359 --> 00:16:43,526
They've got all of them by the balls.

146
00:16:43,651 --> 00:16:46,526
Easier to manage that way.
It's all very simple.

147
00:16:47,234 --> 00:16:50,109
Vadim's position is safe

148
00:16:50,192 --> 00:16:52,067
as long as he serves his purpose.

149
00:16:52,192 --> 00:16:53,317
Or until he dies.

150
00:16:53,442 --> 00:16:55,609
Or until someone lynches him.

151
00:16:55,692 --> 00:16:58,317
Give me a break.
Who's going to lynch him?

152
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:00,275
You guys coming or what?

153
00:17:00,817 --> 00:17:03,067
So let him sleep. Come alone.

154
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,650
I see.

155
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:11,359
If there's no one
to watch him, fine.

156
00:17:12,942 --> 00:17:15,650
I know.
I've just got other things on my mind.

157
00:17:16,817 --> 00:17:18,150
I'll talk to you later.

158
00:17:18,317 --> 00:17:20,192
So what? Not coming?

159
00:17:20,317 --> 00:17:23,983
Pasha is asleep after his shift.
There's no one to watch the kid.

160
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:27,025
Last time they had an excuse too.
Some friends!

161
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:29,400
- What about yours?
- Mine are right here.

162
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:32,150
OK, Kolya, you win.

163
00:17:34,108 --> 00:17:35,858
My friends are shit.

164
00:17:35,983 --> 00:17:37,775
- Sure are!
- Stop it, please.

165
00:17:38,358 --> 00:17:40,816
Kolya, get a grip.
Watch your driving.

166
00:17:40,941 --> 00:17:42,608
My driving!

167
00:17:42,733 --> 00:17:43,941
Lilya...

168
00:17:44,691 --> 00:17:45,941
I'm not saying anything.

169
00:18:08,274 --> 00:18:12,899
Decree No. 1295 of the Pribrezhny
Town Administration

170
00:18:12,983 --> 00:18:18,524
ordered the seizure from Mr Sergeyev
of a land parcel of 0.66 acres

171
00:18:18,649 --> 00:18:21,732
cadastral number 28:136:254:2001,

172
00:18:21,816 --> 00:18:23,774
along with the residential building,

173
00:18:23,899 --> 00:18:26,732
automotive works shed,
repair garage and greenhouse.

174
00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:31,191
Mr Sergeyev petitioned the Zagorye
District Court to repeal this Decree.

175
00:18:31,316 --> 00:18:34,274
The Court ruled to deny the petition.

176
00:18:34,399 --> 00:18:39,565
Mr Sergeyev then petitioned
Pribrezhny Town Court to appeal.

177
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:43,357
During proceedings, Mr Sergeyev
insisted the court ruling be revoked.

178
00:18:43,482 --> 00:18:46,482
The Town Administration
rejected the appeal

179
00:18:46,607 --> 00:18:49,649
and upheld the ruling
of the Zagorye District Court.

180
00:18:49,774 --> 00:18:52,815
Mr Sergeyev states the initial ruling
violated procedural regulations

181
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:57,357
and therefore disputes the conclusion
that the seizure of the land parcel

182
00:18:57,523 --> 00:18:59,315
is lawful.

183
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,898
He says the Administration did not
meet the deadline for notifying him

184
00:19:05,023 --> 00:19:08,773
and violated the procedure
for determining the purchase price.

185
00:19:08,857 --> 00:19:11,523
He also contends
that, when determining the price,

186
00:19:11,648 --> 00:19:16,357
the court did not consider
an independent evaluation he submitted,

187
00:19:16,482 --> 00:19:18,773
which values the property higher
than determined by the Administration.

188
00:19:18,898 --> 00:19:21,106
Me also states
that the Administration

189
00:19:21,231 --> 00:19:24,148
violated civil law.

190
00:19:24,273 --> 00:19:30,023
Mr Sergeyev was not notified
of the upcoming seizure a year in advance

191
00:19:30,148 --> 00:19:32,856
due to which he incurred expenses
related to improving his property.

192
00:19:33,023 --> 00:19:36,898
Also, the purchase price did not consider
his loss of business revenue

193
00:19:36,981 --> 00:19:42,356
as well as his liabilities
to third parties.

194
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:45,564
The Court ruled: by Decree No. 1295
pf Pribrezhny Town Administration,

195
00:19:45,689 --> 00:19:51,439
the land parcel shall be seized
to build a town communications centre.

196
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:55,814
The Decree determines the purchase
price of the land and structures

197
00:19:55,939 --> 00:19:58,564
as 639,540.27 roubles.

198
00:19:58,648 --> 00:20:01,272
The purchase price was determined
based on an evaluation.

199
00:20:01,356 --> 00:20:05,564
Per Mr Sergeyev's request,
Alliance Ltd estimated the value

200
00:20:05,647 --> 00:20:08,522
of liabilities
for the loss of agricultural production

201
00:20:08,647 --> 00:20:13,439
due to the seizure of the land parcel
of 0.66 acres for the town's needs.

202
00:20:13,606 --> 00:20:18,189
The market value of the liabilities
constitutes 3.5 million roubles.

203
00:20:18,356 --> 00:20:19,397
The court questions...

204
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:34,480
...and deems it invalid.

205
00:20:34,605 --> 00:20:38,230
The Court upholds the purchase price
of 639,540.27 roubles

206
00:20:38,314 --> 00:20:41,564
as determined
by the Town Administration's evaluation.

207
00:20:41,688 --> 00:20:46,563
The Court rejects the statement that
the purchase procedure was violated.

208
00:20:46,688 --> 00:20:49,647
The case file contains letters

209
00:20:49,772 --> 00:20:54,480
about the purchase and testimony
of Town Administration officials

210
00:20:54,605 --> 00:20:56,730
stating that Mr Sergeyev

211
00:20:57,188 --> 00:21:00,647
had been notified
of the seizure of the land parcel.

212
00:21:00,772 --> 00:21:03,896
The Court casts doubt
on Mr Sergeyev's claims

213
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,730
that he didn't receive
these notifications.

214
00:21:05,896 --> 00:21:12,396
Having examined Mr Sergeyev's appeal,
Pribrezhny Town Court has concluded

215
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,896
that Mr Sergeyev failed to establish
grounds to repeal the court ruling

216
00:21:17,063 --> 00:21:20,813
pursuant to article 330
of the Civil Procedural Code.

217
00:21:20,938 --> 00:21:26,896
As per articles 320-335 of the Civil
Procedural Code, the court denies

218
00:21:27,021 --> 00:21:31,438
Mr Sergeyev's petition to revoke
the ruling of the Zagorye District Court.

219
00:21:31,563 --> 00:21:36,104
That ruling is upheld,
and Mr Sergeyev's appeal is denied.

220
00:21:36,229 --> 00:21:38,479
The ruling
shall come into effect forthwith.

221
00:21:51,354 --> 00:21:52,979
Well, shall we go?

222
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:55,187
In a minute.

223
00:22:56,103 --> 00:22:58,520
Vadim, every time you come,

224
00:22:58,645 --> 00:23:00,936
all you do
is worry about the election.

225
00:23:01,103 --> 00:23:03,103
It's not for another year.

226
00:23:03,645 --> 00:23:05,853
In fair weather, prepare for foul.

227
00:23:07,603 --> 00:23:10,769
You do well to tend

228
00:23:10,894 --> 00:23:12,603
to worldly matters,

229
00:23:13,269 --> 00:23:15,103
but remember the divine.

230
00:23:15,228 --> 00:23:16,561
But I...

231
00:23:18,103 --> 00:23:19,061
Don't I already?

232
00:23:19,228 --> 00:23:20,644
I know.

233
00:23:22,228 --> 00:23:24,061
You're a most...

234
00:23:25,061 --> 00:23:26,561
charitable patron.

235
00:23:27,228 --> 00:23:30,977
Even today, you come from afar,
bearing gifts.

236
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:35,061
Have some fish.

237
00:23:37,102 --> 00:23:38,311
Right.

238
00:23:40,811 --> 00:23:42,727
I'm telling you,

239
00:23:43,894 --> 00:23:45,894
don't worry so much.

240
00:23:46,061 --> 00:23:48,394
All power comes from God.

241
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:50,852
As long as God wishes for it,
you need not worry.

242
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,977
And does He?

243
00:23:56,394 --> 00:24:00,352
Who can I ask if not you?
You're the priest!

244
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:03,644
He does.

245
00:24:07,185 --> 00:24:09,269
Chase it with some food.

246
00:24:26,227 --> 00:24:27,518
Hello.

247
00:24:28,852 --> 00:24:31,476
Yes. Thank God, finally.

248
00:24:32,226 --> 00:24:37,060
Get Tyagunov's guys on it.

249
00:24:39,018 --> 00:24:40,851
Why wait?

250
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:44,726
Tear down that bastard's
fucking place already!

251
00:24:45,476 --> 00:24:48,435
We've lost so much time
because of him.

252
00:24:50,518 --> 00:24:53,809
How's that your fault?
Drop the excuses!

253
00:24:56,226 --> 00:24:57,976
OK, later.

254
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,893
Lyosha, get my thing...

255
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:04,684
from the glove compartment.

256
00:25:25,726 --> 00:25:27,851
Hey, Vasya.

257
00:25:28,309 --> 00:25:31,809
Let's pay that fucking arsehole...

258
00:25:32,517 --> 00:25:34,225
a visit real quick.

259
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:36,684
The one at the bottom of the hill.

260
00:25:36,809 --> 00:25:38,934
- Past the bridge?
- Yes.

261
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:41,809
There are lots of arseholes
at the bottom of hills.

262
00:25:42,642 --> 00:25:43,934
What?

263
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:48,267
You trying to be smart now?

264
00:25:49,267 --> 00:25:52,684
It's obvious that the prick
wants this place

265
00:25:52,809 --> 00:25:55,058
so he can build himself a palace!

266
00:25:55,225 --> 00:25:56,892
Calm down. That's enough.

267
00:25:57,017 --> 00:25:59,642
I built this place with my own hands!

268
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:09,017
Here we go again.

269
00:26:10,475 --> 00:26:11,558
Kolya...

270
00:26:29,683 --> 00:26:30,808
Here.

271
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:37,349
My whole life is here.

272
00:26:38,933 --> 00:26:41,683
My grandfather lived here.
And my father...

273
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:43,349
He's seen it before.

274
00:26:43,516 --> 00:26:45,308
Stay out of this!

275
00:26:45,391 --> 00:26:46,558
Stop yelling!

276
00:26:46,683 --> 00:26:48,266
Kolya, calm down.

277
00:27:03,432 --> 00:27:04,849
Come on, Dima.

278
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:07,599
Let's have a drink.

279
00:27:19,682 --> 00:27:20,974
Here's to you.

280
00:27:21,724 --> 00:27:22,682
All right.

281
00:27:31,557 --> 00:27:34,849
- To everything you've done for us.
- If you say so, bro.

282
00:27:37,224 --> 00:27:38,557
Thank you.

283
00:27:40,723 --> 00:27:42,223
Thank you.

284
00:27:42,348 --> 00:27:45,432
What are you talking about?
It'll be fine.

285
00:27:45,515 --> 00:27:47,098
But that dirt of yours...

286
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:50,432
Kolya, that's not my fucking dirt.
It's his.

287
00:27:53,015 --> 00:27:54,557
All I'm saying is,

288
00:27:54,682 --> 00:27:56,807
I don't see a way

289
00:27:58,098 --> 00:28:01,015
to put your theory to work.

290
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:06,265
Either way,
they're knocking this place down.

291
00:28:07,973 --> 00:28:14,348
We'll buy that crappy apartment
near Angela's

292
00:28:14,473 --> 00:28:17,056
with that 639,000 roubles
and 27 kopecks

293
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:21,014
and I'll become a cop, like Pasha.

294
00:28:21,848 --> 00:28:22,264
Oh no...

295
00:28:24,598 --> 00:28:26,014
Listen, bro,

296
00:28:26,889 --> 00:28:30,139
this is not like you.

297
00:28:31,098 --> 00:28:32,639
You hear me?

298
00:28:34,973 --> 00:28:38,389
You've never let problems
get to you before.

299
00:28:38,556 --> 00:28:40,848
What's the matter with you?

300
00:28:42,722 --> 00:28:47,722
Things were different.
We're not 20 anymore.

301
00:28:48,222 --> 00:28:50,347
The years take their toll.

302
00:28:50,472 --> 00:28:52,222
Anyway, what are you on about?

303
00:28:54,097 --> 00:28:55,889
Are you a shrink now?

304
00:28:56,014 --> 00:28:59,097
I'm no fucking shrink.

305
00:28:59,222 --> 00:29:01,389
But fuck, man, it's like...

306
00:29:01,847 --> 00:29:06,139
You can look
at this situation differently.

307
00:29:06,264 --> 00:29:07,472
How is that?

308
00:29:07,597 --> 00:29:09,764
Fucking hell...

309
00:29:09,847 --> 00:29:11,180
You're my brother!

310
00:29:11,305 --> 00:29:14,472
Take on the challenge,
for fuck's sake!

311
00:29:14,555 --> 00:29:16,555
It's a fresh start!

312
00:29:17,722 --> 00:29:21,180
Easy for you to say.
You're off to Moscow tomorrow...

313
00:29:21,347 --> 00:29:25,805
What's Moscow got to do with it?
Come with me then. You hear me?

314
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,305
Why not?

315
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:29,013
- To Moscow?
- Sure.

316
00:29:29,055 --> 00:29:31,388
Pack your bags.

317
00:29:32,638 --> 00:29:36,180
Rent a studio apartment
for starters, for about 30,000.

318
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,722
Oh, wow!

319
00:29:37,847 --> 00:29:39,638
What? That's a fair price.

320
00:29:40,347 --> 00:29:44,721
A fucking genius handyman like you
won't have any problems finding work!

321
00:29:44,846 --> 00:29:47,596
With your hands, you'll be all right.

322
00:29:47,721 --> 00:29:50,346
We'll find something for Lilya, too.

323
00:29:50,471 --> 00:29:53,930
Maybe in some shop at first.

324
00:29:54,513 --> 00:29:58,513
Anything is better than cleaning fish
at that stinking fish farm.

325
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:01,680
What's the matter with you, bro?

326
00:30:07,554 --> 00:30:09,096
What about Roma?

327
00:30:09,179 --> 00:30:11,846
What about him? He'll go to school.

328
00:30:11,971 --> 00:30:13,971
He's a kid. He goes to school!

329
00:30:14,054 --> 00:30:15,804
Sort of...

330
00:30:16,888 --> 00:30:19,429
He's barely a C-student.
Who will take him?

331
00:30:19,513 --> 00:30:22,763
They're required to.
They'll take him.

332
00:30:23,346 --> 00:30:24,429
Kolya!

333
00:30:24,513 --> 00:30:27,429
I'm not a C-student. I get Bs.

334
00:30:27,554 --> 00:30:28,846
Don't get worked up.

335
00:30:28,929 --> 00:30:31,429
What are you doing listening to us?

336
00:30:31,512 --> 00:30:34,262
Why would I do that?
I just went to the toilet.

337
00:30:34,429 --> 00:30:35,804
Come over here then!

338
00:30:36,804 --> 00:30:38,429
Come on.

339
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:49,679
What's up guys? You need help?

340
00:30:50,345 --> 00:30:52,637
Kolya, don't you recognise authority

341
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:55,554
when you see it?

342
00:30:57,429 --> 00:30:59,512
And what do you want, "Authority"?

343
00:31:00,429 --> 00:31:02,095
Just all of this.

344
00:31:04,054 --> 00:31:05,470
Come and get it.

345
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:07,803
Will it all fit

346
00:31:07,928 --> 00:31:09,720
into your hearse?

347
00:31:11,053 --> 00:31:12,470
What else?

348
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:17,803
You're all insects.

349
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,553
You always have to make things
difficult, don't you?

350
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:26,553
That's way you're all drowning in shit.

351
00:31:26,678 --> 00:31:28,720
Kolya,

352
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:31,720
have you packed your suitcases?

353
00:31:31,886 --> 00:31:35,761
Look, sir, it's you
who's not supposed to be here now.

354
00:31:35,886 --> 00:31:38,886
The court ruling
hasn't taken effect yet.

355
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:43,761
And your office doesn't entitle you
to come here. Do you have a warrant?

356
00:31:44,595 --> 00:31:46,095
Who are you?

357
00:31:46,178 --> 00:31:47,511
Dmitri Seleznev,

358
00:31:48,136 --> 00:31:51,261
Moscow Bar Association.

359
00:31:51,386 --> 00:31:54,344
Kolya's lawyer in litigation
with your gang.

360
00:31:55,761 --> 00:32:00,678
Oh, yeah, I heard someone
babbling about that.

361
00:32:00,803 --> 00:32:05,386
So what's up, Kolya?
Can't stand up for yourself anymore?

362
00:32:05,511 --> 00:32:07,761
Ignore him, man.
Take it easy, Kolya.

363
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,927
I'll stand up to you, bitch.

364
00:32:13,052 --> 00:32:16,677
Please, no more, I just shit myself.

365
00:32:16,802 --> 00:32:18,719
Scary stuff.

366
00:32:20,052 --> 00:32:22,052
- Sir...
- OK.

367
00:32:23,219 --> 00:32:26,594
Maybe I just wanted to have
a friendly drink with you.

368
00:32:27,969 --> 00:32:30,344
By the way, where is it?
Give it here.

369
00:32:31,344 --> 00:32:32,635
Want some?

370
00:32:33,427 --> 00:32:34,469
No?

371
00:32:35,094 --> 00:32:36,177
Guess not.

372
00:32:36,802 --> 00:32:40,302
I'm not gonna offer him any.
I don't like his kind.

373
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:45,760
Anyway, I wanted to tell you
something to bear in mind.

374
00:32:45,885 --> 00:32:47,844
Lilya, call the police.

375
00:32:47,969 --> 00:32:51,052
Go ahead, Lilya, call them!

376
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:53,343
The police. Do it.

377
00:32:54,468 --> 00:32:56,760
What's your name, kid?

378
00:32:56,885 --> 00:33:00,093
Listen, Vadim,
why are you doing this?

379
00:33:00,218 --> 00:33:02,593
You're not so drunk
that you don't know...

380
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:06,093
Shut your mouth, you courtroom rat.

381
00:33:06,218 --> 00:33:09,010
And you, listen up.

382
00:33:09,093 --> 00:33:11,385
- Fuck off.
- Remember my face!

383
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:13,010
Ignore him, bro.

384
00:33:13,093 --> 00:33:14,885
You piece of shit.

385
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,843
You've never had any fucking rights

386
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:23,218
and never will!

387
00:33:24,218 --> 00:33:25,676
Where the fuck are you going?

388
00:33:26,176 --> 00:33:29,718
Listen, it would be best
if you go now.

389
00:33:30,343 --> 00:33:34,468
You are trespassing.

390
00:33:34,593 --> 00:33:37,218
And the owners are not happy
to see you.

391
00:33:37,384 --> 00:33:40,009
Vadim, let's not escalate the situation.

392
00:33:40,093 --> 00:33:41,801
What did you just say?

393
00:33:42,718 --> 00:33:44,509
I'm the owner.

394
00:33:45,093 --> 00:33:48,093
- Got it?
- Got it. I've got it.

395
00:33:48,218 --> 00:33:50,676
Let's talk about that tomorrow.

396
00:33:51,218 --> 00:33:52,384
Tomorrow.

397
00:33:52,509 --> 00:33:54,926
We have some business to discuss.

398
00:33:55,051 --> 00:33:58,176
Ivan has told me a lot about you.

399
00:34:02,426 --> 00:34:05,717
Ivan who?

400
00:34:05,842 --> 00:34:07,509
Ivan Kostrov.

401
00:34:08,509 --> 00:34:10,842
From the Committee. Kostrov.

402
00:34:12,426 --> 00:34:16,009
Just because we can't see them,
doesn't mean they're not there.

403
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:21,800
Anyway, I'm tired of you all...

404
00:34:22,717 --> 00:34:24,509
So what about tomorrow?

405
00:34:25,509 --> 00:34:26,675
Tomorrow.

406
00:34:29,425 --> 00:34:32,092
Between 3 and 5pm.

407
00:34:33,425 --> 00:34:36,342
Office hours for constituent issues.

408
00:34:38,425 --> 00:34:40,258
I'm all right. I'm all right.

409
00:34:56,508 --> 00:34:59,008
Kolya, are you going out hunting
or something?

410
00:35:01,008 --> 00:35:02,550
Give me that.

411
00:35:04,008 --> 00:35:05,591
Bro,

412
00:35:05,716 --> 00:35:10,800
tomorrow we'll write a statement
about his abuse of office.

413
00:35:10,883 --> 00:35:13,008
We'll tear him to bits, Kolya!

414
00:35:13,091 --> 00:35:14,216
Dima...

415
00:35:16,466 --> 00:35:18,466
I won't go to Moscow.

416
00:35:19,466 --> 00:35:21,133
I'm staying here.

417
00:35:23,716 --> 00:35:25,049
Let's drink.

418
00:35:31,174 --> 00:35:35,008
"The actions of Vadim Shelevyat
caused great harm to my family.

419
00:35:35,674 --> 00:35:39,424
"He was not authorised to implement
a ruling yet to come into effect

420
00:35:39,507 --> 00:35:42,591
"and he committed a criminal act

421
00:35:42,674 --> 00:35:45,257
"as defined by Article 330
of the Criminal Code.

422
00:35:46,007 --> 00:35:49,757

423

of the Criminal Procedural Code,

424

425
00:35:54,882 --> 00:35:58,966
"and, pending evidence,
a criminal case to be opened."

426
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:02,049
Take that, arsehole.

427
00:36:21,965 --> 00:36:23,590
Here's another one, Kolya.

428
00:36:23,715 --> 00:36:24,965
What?

429
00:36:25,048 --> 00:36:26,257
Look.

430
00:36:26,798 --> 00:36:31,215
"Darwin's term for directional
and irreversible historical

431
00:36:31,298 --> 00:36:33,757
"development of life."

432
00:36:35,298 --> 00:36:36,590
9 letters.

433
00:36:37,673 --> 00:36:40,840
A prolonged leap
from the twat to the grave.

434
00:36:41,298 --> 00:36:44,215
What's with the swearing,
Sergeant Potty Mouth?

435
00:36:46,465 --> 00:36:49,298
- Takes one to know one.
- Sure does.

436
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:53,090
"E-vo-lu-tion."

437
00:36:53,715 --> 00:36:54,923
It fits.

438
00:36:58,298 --> 00:36:59,381
Good morning.

439
00:37:01,423 --> 00:37:03,173
Are you almost done?

440
00:37:03,298 --> 00:37:04,589
Yeah, yeah.

441
00:37:05,214 --> 00:37:06,839
Another half hour or so.

442
00:37:07,923 --> 00:37:10,839
I've written it.
Just sign it, and we'll be off.

443
00:37:11,964 --> 00:37:13,589
Dima!

444
00:37:15,423 --> 00:37:19,173
I'm not sure if Kolya told you,
but I just had a birthday.

445
00:37:19,256 --> 00:37:20,298
Happy birthday.

446
00:37:20,423 --> 00:37:24,256
So I invite you to join us tomorrow.

447
00:37:24,339 --> 00:37:26,797
Campfire, kebabs, vodka,
a bit of shooting...

448
00:37:26,922 --> 00:37:28,547
My treat.

449
00:37:28,672 --> 00:37:30,547
Shooting - as in, hunting?

450
00:37:30,714 --> 00:37:32,339
Of course not.

451
00:37:33,006 --> 00:37:34,756
We're going with women and kids.

452
00:37:35,422 --> 00:37:38,964
We'll just do
a little target practice, for fun.

453
00:37:39,422 --> 00:37:40,881
Is it far?

454
00:37:41,006 --> 00:37:42,547
Hundred kilometers or so.

455
00:37:42,631 --> 00:37:45,089
We'll leave early, hit the booze,

456
00:37:45,214 --> 00:37:47,839
shoot a little and come back.

457
00:37:49,047 --> 00:37:50,880
- I'd love to.
- Excellent.

458
00:37:52,214 --> 00:37:53,547
Kolya, I'm ready when you are.

459
00:38:00,714 --> 00:38:01,922
Pardon me?

460
00:38:02,047 --> 00:38:03,089
Are you the victim?

461
00:38:03,589 --> 00:38:06,380
No, Mr Sergeyev is the victim.
I'm his lawyer.

462
00:38:19,838 --> 00:38:21,088
Off he goes.

463
00:38:21,755 --> 00:38:23,797
Reporting to his superiors.

464
00:38:32,838 --> 00:38:34,921
Lilya, got any water?

465
00:38:42,755 --> 00:38:45,088
I have a feeling he won't accept it.

466
00:38:45,921 --> 00:38:48,129
- Can he do that?
- Sure.

467
00:38:48,296 --> 00:38:50,463
Even though he has to by law.

468
00:38:50,546 --> 00:38:52,296
So what then?

469
00:38:52,421 --> 00:38:55,463
We go to the prosecutor's office,
And then court.

470
00:38:55,588 --> 00:38:58,004
If necessary, we'll file a complaint
about this guy too.

471
00:38:58,129 --> 00:39:00,129
We'll need all the facts,
even the minor ones.

472
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:02,588
Are you going to fight
the whole town?

473
00:39:03,588 --> 00:39:06,254
These animals are not
the whole town.

474
00:39:06,338 --> 00:39:08,921
Kolya, you know what I mean.

475
00:39:09,754 --> 00:39:11,796
Where did our lieutenant go?

476
00:39:11,962 --> 00:39:13,254
Just wait.

477
00:39:18,129 --> 00:39:20,254
Hey there, lieutenant!
Where are you?

478
00:39:20,337 --> 00:39:22,171
Sir, calm down!

479
00:39:22,296 --> 00:39:23,754
What's this racket?

480
00:39:23,921 --> 00:39:25,254
Everything's OK.

481
00:39:25,379 --> 00:39:27,837
- I'm not talking to you.
- Will it be long?

482
00:39:27,921 --> 00:39:30,004
What's this behaviour?

483
00:39:30,087 --> 00:39:32,170
Why are you making trouble?

484
00:39:32,754 --> 00:39:34,420
Detain this one.

485
00:39:34,587 --> 00:39:36,504
Put him in custody!
Take him to a cell.

486
00:39:44,587 --> 00:39:48,337
The prosecutor is not here,
and I'm not authorised.

487
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,878
I can't accept your statement.

488
00:39:49,962 --> 00:39:53,128
And there's not a soul
in the entire office besides you?

489
00:39:53,253 --> 00:39:55,212
No one who is authorised.

490
00:39:55,295 --> 00:39:57,753
Did they all get drafted?
You don't think it's strange?

491
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:58,920
No.

492
00:39:59,045 --> 00:40:00,545
We only have two of them.

493
00:40:00,628 --> 00:40:04,378
The public prosecutor is off sick,
and the detective is out on a case.

494
00:40:04,503 --> 00:40:07,045
You can mail it in. Or go to court.

495
00:40:07,212 --> 00:40:09,045
OK, I get it.
Give me a refusal note in writing.

496
00:40:10,253 --> 00:40:13,586
I told you: I'm not authorised.

497
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,253
Hello. I need to see the judge.

498
00:40:17,378 --> 00:40:18,920
No one's here.

499
00:40:19,045 --> 00:40:20,836
- No one at all?
- No one.

500
00:40:21,878 --> 00:40:23,878
No assistants or secretaries?

501
00:40:25,503 --> 00:40:28,378
- When will they be in?
- I've not been informed.

502
00:40:28,545 --> 00:40:30,545
- I see.
- Goodbye.

503
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:31,836
Thanks.

504
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:49,169
- Up the stairs, third floor.
- Thanks.

505
00:41:52,627 --> 00:41:56,251
Why aren't you answering your phone?
I called and called.

506
00:41:56,376 --> 00:41:58,751
Seriously?
That little devil Vitya

507
00:41:58,876 --> 00:42:00,793
must have been playing with it.

508
00:42:01,251 --> 00:42:02,626
Surrender!

509
00:42:02,751 --> 00:42:05,043
- Why try to kill me?
- 'Cause you're pretty!

510
00:42:05,126 --> 00:42:07,918
- Say hello to Lilya!
- Howdy!

511
00:42:08,043 --> 00:42:12,376
Men are all the same.
First, you're pretty. Next, they'll kill you.

512
00:42:12,501 --> 00:42:14,585
Angela, where's Pasha?

513
00:42:34,876 --> 00:42:36,334
I've already heard

514
00:42:36,418 --> 00:42:39,084
of your crusades earlier today.

515
00:42:39,209 --> 00:42:41,626
- Take a seat.
- Thank you.

516
00:42:41,709 --> 00:42:44,834
- What's your name, I forget?
- Dmitry.

517
00:42:44,959 --> 00:42:50,709
Right. So, you're really trying
to stick it to me, aren't you?

518
00:42:50,834 --> 00:42:52,709
You asked for it.

519
00:42:53,167 --> 00:42:55,751
But that's nothing, Vadim,

520
00:42:55,876 --> 00:42:58,375
in comparison
to what's in this folder.

521
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,542
Here, take a look.

522
00:43:02,417 --> 00:43:03,959
There's nothing
you don't already know,

523
00:43:04,042 --> 00:43:08,334
but it's good to refresh
your memory sometimes.

524
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,292
This conversation is off
to a strange start.

525
00:43:11,459 --> 00:43:12,709
How so?

526
00:43:12,875 --> 00:43:15,667
I thought we were going to talk
about your friend.

527
00:43:15,792 --> 00:43:18,667
As in, about our litigation
or something else?

528
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:19,875
Something else.

529
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,167
You must mean his unlawful detention?

530
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:25,833
Article 301
of the Russian Criminal Code.

531
00:43:27,167 --> 00:43:29,000
It's good you've been notified.

532
00:43:29,583 --> 00:43:33,500
Vadim, it would be great
if you saw to it that justice is served

533
00:43:33,625 --> 00:43:35,792
and those responsible
for this outrage are punished.

534
00:43:35,875 --> 00:43:37,292
I would be glad to help, but...

535
00:43:37,417 --> 00:43:41,500
But you don't see what's in it for you?
Just look in the folder.

536
00:43:41,666 --> 00:43:42,958
Take a look.

537
00:43:43,458 --> 00:43:47,166
You'll see that Kolya's release
is only the first step.

538
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:48,916
Here's what I think we'll do,

539
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:53,000
young man.

540
00:43:55,708 --> 00:43:59,916
I'll let your Kolya out,
and you'll gather your stuff

541
00:44:01,166 --> 00:44:03,166
and quietly go back

542
00:44:03,291 --> 00:44:05,416
to where you came from.

543
00:44:05,499 --> 00:44:08,208
- To Moscow?
- Yeah, back to Moscow.

544
00:44:08,333 --> 00:44:11,916
Vadim, I'm afraid
Ivan would not have that.

545
00:44:14,416 --> 00:44:16,708
He'd say,
"Dima, why didn't you do

546
00:44:16,833 --> 00:44:19,624
"everything in your power
to restore justice?"

547
00:44:23,207 --> 00:44:26,457
You know Ivan personally?

548
00:44:26,624 --> 00:44:27,624
Ivan Kostrov?

549
00:44:28,124 --> 00:44:29,999
We're talking about him, right?

550
00:44:30,124 --> 00:44:32,041
Of course I do. You bet.

551
00:44:32,749 --> 00:44:34,166
We're pals.

552
00:44:34,249 --> 00:44:35,916
He's a lawyer, I'm a lawyer.

553
00:44:36,582 --> 00:44:38,582
Moscow is a huge,
but close-knit city.

554
00:44:39,582 --> 00:44:42,457
No one is out of reach.

555
00:44:42,582 --> 00:44:45,582
And if I don't read this, then what?

556
00:44:45,707 --> 00:44:47,207
Doesn't matter.

557
00:44:47,290 --> 00:44:49,832
Take my word for it:
the facts in there are damning.

558
00:44:49,915 --> 00:44:53,582
You know what I'm talking about.
They are, after all, your handiwork.

559
00:44:53,665 --> 00:44:55,207
Horrible stuff.

560
00:44:55,832 --> 00:44:58,582
How do you sleep at night?

561
00:44:59,832 --> 00:45:01,040
So,

562
00:45:02,332 --> 00:45:03,623
let's make a deal, or else...

563
00:45:03,748 --> 00:45:05,123
Or else what?

564
00:45:06,498 --> 00:45:09,165
Oh, it's hard to even imagine
what would happen.

565
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:12,498
All within the provisions of the law,
of course.

566
00:45:12,582 --> 00:45:16,165
Firstly, your name would be all over
the newspapers and the Internet

567
00:45:16,248 --> 00:45:19,332
and on TV, all over the news.

568
00:45:28,123 --> 00:45:30,790
You youngsters
like playing with fire.

569
00:45:30,873 --> 00:45:34,248
Vadim,
you're not exactly an old man either.

570
00:45:34,415 --> 00:45:36,540
Or is it time to retire? No?

571
00:45:36,623 --> 00:45:37,998
Have you thought of that?

572
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:43,581
Come back with the tea later, Yulia.

573
00:45:48,331 --> 00:45:51,414
Right. Let's see it.

574
00:45:53,123 --> 00:45:56,414
Let's see what you're trying
to stick us with here.

575
00:45:56,498 --> 00:45:59,623
A horror movie with you in the lead.

576
00:45:59,706 --> 00:46:04,123
How did it go? They cuffed him
and threw him in the cage.

577
00:46:04,831 --> 00:46:06,539
What did he do? Nothing!

578
00:46:06,664 --> 00:46:10,664
Last night, the mayor barreled in,
drunk, told 'em to pack their things.

579
00:46:10,831 --> 00:46:12,539
They had
another court hearing yesterday.

580
00:46:12,664 --> 00:46:14,206
Yes, they're getting demolished.

581
00:46:14,997 --> 00:46:16,331
That's all.

582
00:46:16,456 --> 00:46:20,414
This morning, they went to the police
to drop off a statement

583
00:46:20,497 --> 00:46:22,247
and they took Kolya in.

584
00:46:24,831 --> 00:46:26,955
Lilya is sitting right here with me.

585
00:46:27,622 --> 00:46:30,955
Don't be dumb,
I'm not calling just for a chat.

586
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:34,455
Tell Stepanych to get his arse
to the police department.

587
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:36,539
We have to get Kolya out of there.

588
00:46:37,997 --> 00:46:39,164
Good.

589
00:46:39,622 --> 00:46:41,330
Yeah, you'd better go yourself.

590
00:46:42,955 --> 00:46:45,914
And call us right away.
We're stressing out here.

591
00:46:45,997 --> 00:46:50,247
And pick up when I call,
or I'll worry. OK then.

592
00:46:50,330 --> 00:46:51,330
What?

593
00:46:51,997 --> 00:46:53,122
Me too.

594
00:46:54,372 --> 00:46:56,580
OK, Pasha, go already. Bye.

595
00:46:58,247 --> 00:47:00,247
- Something like that.
- Thanks.

596
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:02,538
Don't worry, they'll get him out.

597
00:47:02,663 --> 00:47:06,330
They got Vova out 5 times.
He was in for real stuff - fighting,

598
00:47:06,455 --> 00:47:08,205
theft...

599
00:47:08,330 --> 00:47:10,163
Mum, I'm hungry.

600
00:47:10,288 --> 00:47:11,913
Go play outside.
Dinner's not ready yet.

601
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:14,080
- Can I?
- What?

602
00:47:14,205 --> 00:47:16,163
- Go outside?
- I just told you, go!

603
00:47:16,288 --> 00:47:19,746
But not too far. If you go
to building 9 again, I'll kill you!

604
00:47:19,871 --> 00:47:21,455
- OK, Mum!
- And put your hat on!

605
00:47:29,704 --> 00:47:30,913
Come on in.

606
00:47:40,871 --> 00:47:43,079
It's OK, honey. We'll pull through.

607
00:47:43,704 --> 00:47:47,371
We'll get all hands on deck
and do a great job.

608
00:47:48,913 --> 00:47:52,704
Won't be fancy, but it'll be homely.

609
00:47:52,829 --> 00:47:53,871
Won't it?

610
00:47:58,954 --> 00:48:00,746
Let's go look at the kitchen.

611
00:48:05,579 --> 00:48:07,537
There's even a radiator in here.

612
00:48:08,454 --> 00:48:09,537
You hear me?

613
00:48:15,537 --> 00:48:17,454
Let's say you got me. Now what?

614
00:48:17,870 --> 00:48:19,120
That depends on you.

615
00:48:19,245 --> 00:48:21,704
I got that much. What do you want?

616
00:48:24,537 --> 00:48:28,745
You're the second public official today
to use that tone with me.

617
00:48:28,829 --> 00:48:31,995
Don't beat around the bush.
Get to the point.

618
00:48:33,453 --> 00:48:35,953
I want Kolya to keep what's his.

619
00:48:40,453 --> 00:48:42,037
That's not possible.

620
00:48:45,037 --> 00:48:47,245
I thought there was
nothing impossible for you.

621
00:48:48,328 --> 00:48:50,703
Well, now you know better.

622
00:48:50,828 --> 00:48:53,495
You can't get 3.5 million?
I don't believe that.

623
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:55,661
Oh, that's what you mean.

624
00:48:56,828 --> 00:48:58,286
That I can do.

625
00:48:58,370 --> 00:49:00,495
And, of course, release Kolya.

626
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:01,995
It's a deal.

627
00:49:03,328 --> 00:49:05,078
Leave me your phone number.

628
00:49:05,703 --> 00:49:08,953
I'll call you in a couple of days.
We'll meet and discuss the details.

629
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:10,620
You'll still be here?

630
00:49:10,745 --> 00:49:11,953
Yes, I'll be in town.

631
00:49:12,453 --> 00:49:14,203
Except what's there to discuss?

632
00:49:15,203 --> 00:49:18,661
We'll only need to meet
so you can hand me the money.

633
00:49:21,869 --> 00:49:25,369
Hey, are you baptised?

634
00:49:25,494 --> 00:49:26,494
What?

635
00:49:27,619 --> 00:49:29,286
Why da you ask?

636
00:49:29,786 --> 00:49:31,453
I'm just curious.

637
00:49:33,036 --> 00:49:35,286
I'm a lawyer, Vadim.
I believe in facts.

638
00:49:40,077 --> 00:49:40,369
OK. You got it.

639
00:49:40,369 --> 00:49:41,536
Goodbye.

640
00:49:45,702 --> 00:49:46,911
Bye.

641
00:50:19,785 --> 00:50:22,618
Is everything OK, Vadim?

642
00:50:23,993 --> 00:50:24,243
Yes.

643
00:50:24,702 --> 00:50:26,868
You never brought me that aspirin.

644
00:50:28,993 --> 00:50:31,618
Get me those three right away.

645
00:50:32,868 --> 00:50:33,952
Who?

646
00:50:34,077 --> 00:50:36,660
Tarasov, Goryunov and Tkachuk.

647
00:50:37,368 --> 00:50:39,618
Find them, I don't care how.

648
00:50:43,285 --> 00:50:44,785
And close the door.

649
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:46,868
You think
he'll give us the 3 million?

650
00:50:46,993 --> 00:50:49,076
Not 3, but 3.5.

651
00:50:49,201 --> 00:50:50,493
We'll see.

652
00:50:51,035 --> 00:50:53,951
But he shit himself big time.
And that's a good sign.

653
00:50:55,535 --> 00:50:56,868
Right...

654
00:50:57,826 --> 00:51:01,159
What did I have here last time?

655
00:51:01,284 --> 00:51:03,243
Borscht, dumplings, beer.

656
00:51:03,368 --> 00:51:04,743
That's it.

657
00:51:04,909 --> 00:51:06,076
Have you decided?

658
00:51:06,118 --> 00:51:09,243
Yes, Tatyana.
Bring us two borschts, please,

659
00:51:09,701 --> 00:51:13,076
two servings of dumplings,
beer and fruit juice.

660
00:51:13,201 --> 00:51:14,743
Or are you having beer too?

661
00:51:14,909 --> 00:51:16,409
Fruit juice is fine.

662
00:51:16,534 --> 00:51:17,742
- Fruit juice then.
- Is that it?

663
00:51:17,867 --> 00:51:18,909
Yes, that's all.

664
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:21,659
I have to go up to my room.

665
00:51:21,742 --> 00:51:24,242
Please wait 10 minutes
so the food doesn't get cold.

666
00:51:25,159 --> 00:51:27,034
- All right.
- Thanks.

667
00:51:29,409 --> 00:51:31,659
Can you wait a bit?
I'll be right back.

668
00:52:44,324 --> 00:52:45,366
Kolya?

669
00:52:45,491 --> 00:52:46,824
<i>Hello, where are you?</i>

670
00:52:46,991 --> 00:52:49,991
We're in the restaurant at the hotel.

671
00:52:50,116 --> 00:52:51,158
Well, of course.

672
00:52:51,324 --> 00:52:55,491
I'm behind bars - you're at a restaurant.
I should have known.

673
00:52:56,824 --> 00:52:58,533
Yes, they released me.

674
00:53:01,116 --> 00:53:05,782
Not on the phone.
Let's meet, and you'll tell me everything.

675
00:53:05,866 --> 00:53:07,574
Finish up.

676
00:53:07,699 --> 00:53:10,699
I'm headed there. See you.

677
00:53:43,990 --> 00:53:45,990
They've been keeping dirt on me!

678
00:53:46,115 --> 00:53:48,323
I've known it a long time.

679
00:53:48,448 --> 00:53:52,115
All I ever hear from you is
the same thing right, left and centre:

680
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:55,990
"Everything's fine, Vadim".

681
00:53:56,782 --> 00:53:59,032
"Everything's fine, perfect weather -

682
00:53:59,532 --> 00:54:01,407
"nothing to worry about!"

683
00:54:01,573 --> 00:54:04,115
But I'm fucking worried!

684
00:54:05,323 --> 00:54:09,406
Because I smell a rat.
Something bad is brewing!

685
00:54:09,531 --> 00:54:12,698
When did anything like this
ever happen? I crush some louse

686
00:54:12,865 --> 00:54:17,698
and he turns the tables on me!
Brings in a lawyer from Moscow!

687
00:54:17,865 --> 00:54:20,490
And that bastard starts
blackmailing me.

688
00:54:20,615 --> 00:54:22,615
And drops big names!

689
00:54:22,698 --> 00:54:24,489
What if he's bluffing?

690
00:54:24,573 --> 00:54:25,739
Bluffing?

691
00:54:25,864 --> 00:54:29,864
How about you stop doodling
and figure out who's paying him?

692
00:54:29,989 --> 00:54:31,573
You think it's that loser Kolya?

693
00:54:31,698 --> 00:54:33,906
You should know better, woman.

694
00:54:34,031 --> 00:54:38,906
Or do you think
that Moscow lawyer came here

695
00:54:39,031 --> 00:54:40,739
to bust his arse for free?

696
00:54:40,864 --> 00:54:42,156
More importantly,

697
00:54:42,281 --> 00:54:45,531
where did he get that information?

698
00:54:46,989 --> 00:54:50,322
I almost fucking lost it
when I opened that folder.

699
00:54:50,406 --> 00:54:52,947
So what was in that folder?

700
00:54:53,031 --> 00:54:55,989
You don't need to know that.

701
00:54:59,031 --> 00:55:03,364
So they have something on you
that we don't know about?

702
00:55:03,489 --> 00:55:05,822
We have an election in a year.

703
00:55:05,947 --> 00:55:07,155
Did you forget?

704
00:55:08,489 --> 00:55:10,530
If I don't get elected...

705
00:55:11,572 --> 00:55:12,989
Need I say more?

706
00:55:15,864 --> 00:55:18,114
You'll all go down.

707
00:55:18,739 --> 00:55:21,030
No holidays abroad, no mansions,

708
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:22,822
no cash.

709
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:26,155
We'll all be marching

710
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:28,280
off to the monastery

711
00:55:28,405 --> 00:55:30,405
to a jolly tune.

712
00:55:30,488 --> 00:55:32,363
You're paranoid.

713
00:55:32,488 --> 00:55:35,447
You see enemies everywhere.
Ease up on the booze.

714
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:39,655
Your head will roll first!

715
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:43,280
Cut the drama.
And don't yell at me!

716
00:55:43,405 --> 00:55:45,447
Save that for your wife.

717
00:55:45,988 --> 00:55:48,071
Let's be constructive.

718
00:55:48,155 --> 00:55:49,446
Let's.

719
00:55:50,946 --> 00:55:53,446
Maybe I could lean on him a bit?

720
00:55:54,113 --> 00:55:56,780
Within lawful limits, of course.

721
00:55:56,946 --> 00:55:58,488
Absolutely not.

722
00:56:00,946 --> 00:56:05,280
First off, get me the story
on this Moscow lawyer.

723
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:12,238
Use your own channels or work together,
but find out who he is

724
00:56:12,904 --> 00:56:15,404
and who he's working for.

725
00:56:16,196 --> 00:56:19,279
He was rubbing it in
about Kostrov,

726
00:56:19,404 --> 00:56:21,154
and you say "lean on him"?

727
00:56:21,279 --> 00:56:22,946
The Committee Chairman?

728
00:56:23,613 --> 00:56:28,363
That's right, sweetheart. Why do you
think I've been going on about it?

729
00:56:31,862 --> 00:56:33,279
So get to it.

730
00:56:34,279 --> 00:56:35,987
Tomorrow, I'll consult the bosses.

731
00:56:36,071 --> 00:56:40,779
They're going
to run their checks on him.

732
00:56:41,821 --> 00:56:45,029
Get to it, my good people,
and get cracking.

733
00:57:06,904 --> 00:57:07,904
Hello, Dad...

734
00:57:08,362 --> 00:57:09,862
But it's still early.

735
00:57:10,695 --> 00:57:14,445
Oh, I forgot...
Yeah, I'll be right there... Sure, OK.

736
00:57:15,112 --> 00:57:16,820
Yeah, I'm not far.

737
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:19,695
OK, guys, I'm off.

738
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:24,362
- Mummy calling you?
- We're going out shooting tomorrow.

739
00:57:24,487 --> 00:57:26,112
You're lucky!

740
00:57:26,987 --> 00:57:29,987
That's right,
go and watch your bedtime cartoons.

741
00:57:59,819 --> 00:58:01,361
Where is everyone?

742
00:58:01,903 --> 00:58:03,694
Mum is asleep.

743
00:58:03,778 --> 00:58:07,111
Dima's in the outhouse
with a magazine.

744
00:58:12,736 --> 00:58:13,986
So, mate,

745
00:58:15,944 --> 00:58:17,777
you like Dima?

746
00:58:18,194 --> 00:58:20,319
Sure. Seems like an all right guy.

747
00:58:23,111 --> 00:58:26,236
That "all right guy"
did a major deed today.

748
00:58:26,986 --> 00:58:28,111
What deed?

749
00:58:28,777 --> 00:58:30,194
He squeezed the mayor.

750
00:58:31,736 --> 00:58:32,777
What?

751
00:58:33,444 --> 00:58:35,319
Just like that, son.

752
00:58:35,444 --> 00:58:37,152
Took him by the balls

753
00:58:37,902 --> 00:58:40,485
and pulled ever so gently.

754
00:58:43,527 --> 00:58:44,902
I don't get it.

755
00:58:45,944 --> 00:58:47,985
You'll get it when you're older.

756
00:58:48,069 --> 00:58:49,235
Listen,

757
00:58:49,735 --> 00:58:51,652
you stink of fire.

758
00:58:51,777 --> 00:58:53,902
Hanging out
in the old church again?

759
00:58:54,069 --> 00:58:55,069
Well, yeah.

760
00:58:55,652 --> 00:58:57,318
Always looking for trouble.

761
00:58:58,568 --> 00:59:01,860
- What kind of trouble?
- Some kind or other.

762
00:59:03,068 --> 00:59:05,818
Stuffing your face right before bed?

763
00:59:07,235 --> 00:59:08,235
Well, yeah.

764
00:59:14,568 --> 00:59:15,902
Come over here.

765
00:59:16,651 --> 00:59:17,693
Sit down.

766
00:59:19,443 --> 00:59:20,735
What is it?

767
00:59:23,693 --> 00:59:25,068
Were you drinking beer?

768
00:59:26,735 --> 00:59:29,193
No. The other guys had some.

769
00:59:29,276 --> 00:59:31,026
I can smell it on you.

770
00:59:31,151 --> 00:59:32,235
Hey, Roma.

771
00:59:35,651 --> 00:59:36,943
What took you so long?

772
00:59:37,068 --> 00:59:38,859
Lay a cable out there?

773
00:59:39,526 --> 00:59:41,943
Interesting book
you've got out there.

774
00:59:43,443 --> 00:59:45,359
Couldn't put it down?

775
00:59:47,359 --> 00:59:48,443
Yeah...

776
00:59:51,943 --> 00:59:53,526
A couple of comedians, eh?

777
00:59:54,651 --> 00:59:59,192
Yeah, that's our shitty
northern sense of humour.

778
01:00:05,151 --> 01:00:06,817
What's so funny?

779
01:00:06,942 --> 01:00:10,151
It's all good, bro.

780
01:00:11,484 --> 01:00:13,234
It's all good.

781
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:15,526
No, seriously, what am I missing?

782
01:00:17,567 --> 01:00:19,192
Whatever, you idiots...

783
01:02:47,981 --> 01:02:50,273
Can you do this?

784
01:02:50,356 --> 01:02:52,648
I'll show you. Watch.

785
01:02:55,565 --> 01:02:57,648
Pasha, turn off that crap.

786
01:03:00,023 --> 01:03:01,398
Dima!

787
01:03:01,898 --> 01:03:03,440
Come here for a moment.

788
01:03:07,148 --> 01:03:08,773
Pasha, what the hell?

789
01:03:08,856 --> 01:03:11,606
Angela, let's enjoy the silence.

790
01:03:11,731 --> 01:03:13,856
Not enough silence at your place?

791
01:03:15,606 --> 01:03:16,648
Dima,

792
01:03:17,273 --> 01:03:19,939
- I'm trusting you with my rifle.
- Thanks.

793
01:03:20,106 --> 01:03:22,606
Every guy should have his own gun,

794
01:03:22,731 --> 01:03:24,648
so you don't have to share Kolya's.

795
01:03:24,773 --> 01:03:26,023
Agreed.

796
01:03:26,897 --> 01:03:28,564
What will you use then?

797
01:03:28,689 --> 01:03:30,231
I'll show you.

798
01:03:30,356 --> 01:03:31,522
You need help, Kolya?

799
01:03:31,647 --> 01:03:34,731
No, Dima, I've got this.
Relax, kick back.

800
01:03:34,856 --> 01:03:36,022
You're the guest.

801
01:03:38,272 --> 01:03:39,897
Wow, Stepanych!

802
01:03:40,022 --> 01:03:41,439
Someone's armed for war.

803
01:03:41,606 --> 01:03:44,606
Why not? I like shooting in style.
It's my birthday.

804
01:03:44,731 --> 01:03:48,730
- What, no grenade launcher?
- Show me the target, I'll get one.

805
01:03:51,522 --> 01:03:54,522
- Mum, I'm thirsty.
- It's in the car.

806
01:03:57,814 --> 01:04:00,564
Where are you going?
Out of the water, now!

807
01:04:00,647 --> 01:04:03,730
Vitya, are you deaf?
I said, get out of the water!

808
01:04:07,147 --> 01:04:08,397
So, Kolya,

809
01:04:09,563 --> 01:04:10,855
shall we?

810
01:04:14,897 --> 01:04:16,147
Sure.

811
01:04:16,897 --> 01:04:17,897
Dima,

812
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:19,730
Pasha, come on!

813
01:05:01,521 --> 01:05:02,771
Dima,

814
01:05:03,688 --> 01:05:06,896
one drink if you hit it,
three if you miss.

815
01:05:07,021 --> 01:05:08,479
Got it.

816
01:05:13,896 --> 01:05:15,271
One drink!

817
01:05:18,646 --> 01:05:19,937
Just one!

818
01:05:20,021 --> 01:05:22,437
To your health, Stepanych!
Cheers!

819
01:05:22,521 --> 01:05:23,854
Same to you.

820
01:05:25,229 --> 01:05:27,604
Go, Pasha. Nail it.

821
01:05:27,687 --> 01:05:29,312
Don't jinx me.

822
01:05:37,854 --> 01:05:38,895
Three drinks for him.

823
01:05:38,979 --> 01:05:41,687
He missed on purpose,
to get shitfaced.

824
01:05:42,395 --> 01:05:44,229
- Just pour it.
- Have a pickle.

825
01:05:44,354 --> 01:05:45,854
To you, Comrade Colonel.

826
01:05:47,145 --> 01:05:49,145
Dima, you show them.

827
01:05:54,353 --> 01:05:56,478
Anyone can hit it with a sight.

828
01:05:57,603 --> 01:05:58,978
The sight was closed.

829
01:05:59,103 --> 01:06:00,895
Are you for me or against me?

830
01:06:02,395 --> 01:06:03,687
Stepanych.

831
01:06:03,770 --> 01:06:06,478
Pleasure to meet you,
happy birthday!

832
01:06:06,603 --> 01:06:07,853
Pleasure's all mine.

833
01:06:13,312 --> 01:06:14,436
Stepanych, just don't...

834
01:06:18,436 --> 01:06:19,853
Enjoying the silence?

835
01:06:19,978 --> 01:06:21,603
What did you do that for?

836
01:06:21,728 --> 01:06:23,936
What do we use for a target now?

837
01:06:24,061 --> 01:06:26,895
Your hat? Are you fucking crazy?

838
01:06:26,978 --> 01:06:28,270
Kolya,  the kids...

839
01:06:28,395 --> 01:06:31,353
What about the kids?
They just went deaf.

840
01:06:31,478 --> 01:06:32,686
No, I heard everything.

841
01:06:32,811 --> 01:06:36,269
Can't I shoot to my heart's content
on my birthday?

842
01:06:36,394 --> 01:06:37,394
Well, now you have.

843
01:06:37,561 --> 01:06:40,561
I've got better targets still.

844
01:06:42,311 --> 01:06:43,561
Pasha!

845
01:06:43,728 --> 01:06:44,853
Go get them.

846
01:06:44,978 --> 01:06:47,478
Angela, shall we get started
on the kebabs?

847
01:06:49,644 --> 01:06:52,561
- Can I shoot the AK, please?
- Ask Stepanych.

848
01:06:52,686 --> 01:06:55,269
Stepanych, can I fire your AK?

849
01:06:55,394 --> 01:06:56,644
Sure.

850
01:06:57,102 --> 01:06:59,727
He's a grown boy. Let him.

851
01:06:59,852 --> 01:07:02,144
Stay with us, gals.
It's about to get interesting.

852
01:07:02,227 --> 01:07:04,352
Call us when it does.

853
01:07:05,977 --> 01:07:08,811
- I'll go and light the grill.
- Can you manage?

854
01:07:09,644 --> 01:07:10,686
I think so...

855
01:07:19,019 --> 01:07:21,310
Nice one, Stepanych!

856
01:07:23,685 --> 01:07:25,769
Got anyone more current?

857
01:07:25,852 --> 01:07:28,519
I've got all kinds of stuff.

858
01:07:28,685 --> 01:07:31,352
But it's too early
for the current ones.

859
01:07:31,394 --> 01:07:33,769
Not enough
of a historical perspective.

860
01:07:33,894 --> 01:07:36,269
Let them ripen up on the wall a bit.

861
01:07:37,477 --> 01:07:38,518
How do we stand them up?

862
01:07:38,643 --> 01:07:40,935
Nail them to the log.

863
01:07:41,602 --> 01:07:42,852
Do we have nails?

864
01:07:43,393 --> 01:07:44,477
No.

865
01:07:45,018 --> 01:07:46,810
I've got some screws in the car.

866
01:07:53,768 --> 01:07:55,310
Let's go have a drink.

867
01:07:55,435 --> 01:07:56,643
Let's.

868
01:08:02,476 --> 01:08:04,476
I've got Yeltsin, too.

869
01:08:06,268 --> 01:08:08,935
But he's more small-time.

870
01:08:10,018 --> 01:08:11,476
The drunken conductor...

871
01:08:12,810 --> 01:08:15,143
We forgot the nails...
Your fault.

872
01:08:15,310 --> 01:08:18,101
Look at you, girls!
There's a sight for sore eyes!

873
01:08:18,226 --> 01:08:20,601
Look at those honed,
precise movements!

874
01:08:20,768 --> 01:08:22,101
Yeah.

875
01:08:22,268 --> 01:08:24,018
We're quite the roadside attraction!

876
01:08:32,809 --> 01:08:35,268
- Any bread?
- In the bag.

877
01:08:35,393 --> 01:08:38,893
- What else is there?
- Pickles.

878
01:08:38,976 --> 01:08:40,767
- Help me.
- I'm busy.

879
01:08:40,851 --> 01:08:43,642
- I'm busy too.
- What are you busy with?

880
01:08:43,767 --> 01:08:44,976
With stuff...

881
01:08:47,559 --> 01:08:51,101
Kolya, come here! Let's drink.

882
01:09:00,601 --> 01:09:01,892
That's enough.

883
01:09:02,350 --> 01:09:05,725
My oh my, what a guy...

884
01:09:08,475 --> 01:09:10,059
Where are you off to, Lilya?

885
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:12,600
Wouldn't you like to know?

886
01:09:12,725 --> 01:09:14,809
Did we bring the charcoal?

887
01:09:14,934 --> 01:09:17,225
- What for?
- We'll run out of wood.

888
01:09:17,350 --> 01:09:20,934
Plenty of driftwood.
Go get some, but have a drink first.

889
01:09:21,059 --> 01:09:22,558
Chase it down.

890
01:09:24,058 --> 01:09:26,558
Where's my drink?

891
01:09:26,683 --> 01:09:27,850
Here you are.

892
01:09:29,225 --> 01:09:30,600
Thank you.

893
01:09:33,892 --> 01:09:36,017
Oh, this is nice!

894
01:09:37,725 --> 01:09:41,142
- Where is that wood, you say?
- Past the waterfall. You'll see it.

895
01:09:41,267 --> 01:09:42,433
Got it.

896
01:09:54,808 --> 01:09:57,183
Vitya, come down here.

897
01:09:57,266 --> 01:09:58,350
I'm scared.

898
01:09:58,475 --> 01:10:00,058
- Give me your hand.
- No, I'm scared.

899
01:10:01,808 --> 01:10:03,641
Suit yourself.

900
01:10:13,141 --> 01:10:14,641
Where's your kid?

901
01:10:14,766 --> 01:10:16,308
And where's yours?

902
01:10:21,016 --> 01:10:22,683
He'll break his neck.

903
01:10:22,808 --> 01:10:24,641
He'll be fine.

904
01:10:24,807 --> 01:10:28,641
Let him run around and enjoy nature.
There are no animals here.

905
01:10:28,807 --> 01:10:31,391
Man is the most dangerous animal.

906
01:10:31,474 --> 01:10:34,141
- None of those here either.
- Well, we're here.

907
01:10:34,266 --> 01:10:37,724
- You calling yourself a man?
- Get a handle on your woman, Pasha.

908
01:10:37,807 --> 01:10:39,557
Too late now.

909
01:10:41,974 --> 01:10:43,307
Mummy!

910
01:10:45,349 --> 01:10:46,890
What happened, Vitya?

911
01:10:46,974 --> 01:10:49,724
That man is choking Lilya.

912
01:10:49,807 --> 01:10:51,474
Roma saw it and started crying.

913
01:10:51,599 --> 01:10:53,682
What are you talking about? What man?

914
01:10:53,765 --> 01:10:55,682
The handsome one from Moscow.

915
01:11:02,599 --> 01:11:03,849
You coppers

916
01:11:03,932 --> 01:11:06,307
just gonna wait
for the mayhem to start?

917
01:11:06,890 --> 01:11:09,057
Mum, what's "mayhem"?

918
01:11:10,973 --> 01:11:13,598
- You'll know when you're older.
- I want to know now.

919
01:11:13,723 --> 01:11:16,223
Let's put that gun away

920
01:11:16,932 --> 01:11:18,307
from harm.

921
01:11:23,557 --> 01:11:25,182
Mum, what's "harm"?

922
01:11:25,265 --> 01:11:28,848
Stop annoying me.
Remember when you set the cat on fire?

923
01:11:29,431 --> 01:11:32,931
- Yeah. Who did it this time?
- Nobody.

924
01:11:33,056 --> 01:11:36,056
- Then where's the harm?
- Knock it off.

925
01:11:37,723 --> 01:11:39,098
Oh, God...

926
01:11:39,848 --> 01:11:42,098
You've got too anxious, Vadim.

927
01:11:42,223 --> 01:11:46,515
Worrying yourself and others
over nothing.

928
01:11:46,598 --> 01:11:48,681
As if you don't know

929
01:11:48,764 --> 01:11:52,098
we're all in God's hands.
It's His will.

930
01:11:52,223 --> 01:11:55,223
Of course I know, Father.

931
01:11:55,348 --> 01:11:56,973
So what troubles you?

932
01:11:57,473 --> 01:11:59,723
Is your faith wavering?

933
01:12:00,556 --> 01:12:03,056
Do you take communion?
Go to confession?

934
01:12:04,681 --> 01:12:06,723
Every Sunday, without fail.

935
01:12:07,681 --> 01:12:08,931
I try to.

936
01:12:09,639 --> 01:12:12,972
Of course I can't always make it.
I get so busy...

937
01:12:13,056 --> 01:12:14,597
But I try.

938
01:12:15,722 --> 01:12:17,847
Who's your confessor?

939
01:12:21,514 --> 01:12:25,514
Our local priest,
the one you referred me to.

940
01:12:25,639 --> 01:12:27,097
Father Alexei?

941
01:12:27,222 --> 01:12:28,597
That's the one.

942
01:12:29,722 --> 01:12:31,680
He's a good priest.

943
01:12:32,264 --> 01:12:33,972
Seems OK.

944
01:12:35,430 --> 01:12:37,514
Get a hold of yourself, Vadim.

945
01:12:37,597 --> 01:12:40,722
And don't worry,
you are doing God's work.

946
01:12:41,389 --> 01:12:44,014
It is said
that good deeds are done

947
01:12:44,139 --> 01:12:46,347
happily and with ease,

948
01:12:47,347 --> 01:12:49,055
but don't forget

949
01:12:49,139 --> 01:12:52,305
the enemy is ever ready
and does not sleep.

950
01:12:52,388 --> 01:12:54,138
That's the thing.

951
01:12:54,263 --> 01:12:56,305
You know...

952
01:12:56,847 --> 01:12:59,222
It's like everything is going wrong.

953
01:13:00,472 --> 01:13:01,180
I'm uneasy.

954
01:13:01,722 --> 01:13:02,680
I'm uneasy.

955
01:13:03,430 --> 01:13:04,513
What's happened is...

956
01:13:04,638 --> 01:13:08,013
Don't reveal anything to me.
You're not at confession.

957
01:13:09,847 --> 01:13:12,013
You and I may be working

958
01:13:12,555 --> 01:13:14,180
for the same cause.

959
01:13:14,763 --> 01:13:18,763
But you've got your territory,
and I've got mine.

960
01:13:18,888 --> 01:13:20,846
I understand that.

961
01:13:23,638 --> 01:13:25,680
I just feel ill at ease...

962
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:30,555
I told you a couple of days ago,
and I'll tell you again:

963
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:32,846
all power is from God.

964
01:13:33,429 --> 01:13:35,763
Where there's power, there's might.

965
01:13:35,929 --> 01:13:39,888
If you hold power in your territory,

966
01:13:40,554 --> 01:13:44,721
solve your issues yourself,
with your might.

967
01:13:44,846 --> 01:13:47,638
Don't go looking for help,

968
01:13:47,763 --> 01:13:50,346
or the enemy will think
you are weak.

969
01:13:53,262 --> 01:13:56,262
Honestly, I have to lecture you
like a child.

970
01:13:56,429 --> 01:13:57,429
Vadim...

971
01:13:58,846 --> 01:14:00,721
I don't recognise you like this.

972
01:14:03,221 --> 01:14:05,012
Everything OK with the wife?

973
01:14:05,887 --> 01:14:07,429
I think so.

974
01:14:07,554 --> 01:14:08,971
How are the kids?

975
01:14:09,721 --> 01:14:11,262
They're fine.

976
01:14:12,554 --> 01:14:14,012
You're not sick?

977
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:18,137
No.

978
01:14:24,179 --> 01:14:26,137
That's a blessing.

979
01:14:35,137 --> 01:14:36,887
God bless you.

980
01:15:35,636 --> 01:15:37,844
It's all my fault.

981
01:15:37,969 --> 01:15:39,886
No such thing.

982
01:15:40,886 --> 01:15:43,386
Each of us is guilty
of our own faults.

983
01:15:44,636 --> 01:15:46,844
Everything is everyone's fault.

984
01:15:48,677 --> 01:15:51,177
Even if we confess,

985
01:15:51,636 --> 01:15:54,594
the law doesn't hold it
to be a proof of guilt.

986
01:15:56,552 --> 01:15:59,552
We're innocent until proven guilty.

987
01:16:03,719 --> 01:16:06,885
But who's going to prove anything?
And to whom?

988
01:16:10,885 --> 01:16:12,635
Do you believe in God?

989
01:16:14,302 --> 01:16:16,760
Why do you all keep
asking me about God?

990
01:16:16,885 --> 01:16:18,427
I believe in facts.

991
01:16:18,552 --> 01:16:20,385
I'm a lawyer, Lilya.

992
01:16:29,468 --> 01:16:32,468
Don't. Please.

993
01:16:33,427 --> 01:16:35,177
No confessions.

994
01:16:41,010 --> 01:16:43,551
Because there's no proof?

995
01:16:45,968 --> 01:16:47,593
And there won't be any.

996
01:16:55,176 --> 01:16:57,301
Will you come with me?

997
01:17:05,218 --> 01:17:07,634
I don't understand you.

998
01:17:09,384 --> 01:17:11,551
I don't understand myself.

999
01:17:53,550 --> 01:17:56,800
I'd love to run away
with someone too.

1000
01:17:58,092 --> 01:17:59,592
Women are dumb.

1001
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:02,675
Why?

1002
01:18:04,633 --> 01:18:06,967
Because you can't run away
from yourself.

1003
01:18:08,175 --> 01:18:09,467
Maybe not,

1004
01:18:09,592 --> 01:18:12,342
but I sure can run away from you.

1005
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:16,883
Where to?

1006
01:18:18,258 --> 01:18:19,967
To whore around in Moscow?

1007
01:18:20,092 --> 01:18:22,133
- Why "whore around"?
- Because you're a whore.

1008
01:18:26,133 --> 01:18:27,466
See that?

1009
01:18:27,591 --> 01:18:28,800
Want me to smack you too?

1010
01:18:28,925 --> 01:18:29,966
What?

1011
01:18:30,758 --> 01:18:33,633
You guys can't take a joke?

1012
01:18:35,508 --> 01:18:39,675
I think I'd run
all the way to America.

1013
01:18:40,591 --> 01:18:43,341
Great. Why not the moon?

1014
01:18:43,466 --> 01:18:46,091
Are you asking for another slap?

1015
01:18:48,174 --> 01:18:49,924
Are the boys asleep?

1016
01:18:50,549 --> 01:18:51,924
Yeah.

1017
01:18:53,758 --> 01:18:55,466
Roma...

1018
01:18:56,924 --> 01:18:58,091
he's...

1019
01:18:59,258 --> 01:19:00,508
depressed.

1020
01:19:01,049 --> 01:19:02,758
That's understandable.

1021
01:19:04,174 --> 01:19:06,132
I'll talk to him tomorrow.

1022
01:19:07,216 --> 01:19:08,424
Kolya,

1023
01:19:09,591 --> 01:19:10,924
don't drink so much again.

1024
01:19:12,799 --> 01:19:16,091
Roma's traumatised enough as it is.

1025
01:19:16,591 --> 01:19:18,049
I won't.

1026
01:19:20,424 --> 01:19:21,466
Good.

1027
01:19:42,215 --> 01:19:43,840
She's back.

1028
01:19:45,507 --> 01:19:48,382
- Thank God.
- Maybe she's getting her things.

1029
01:19:49,132 --> 01:19:53,257
Shut up, Pasha. Go get Vitya.

1030
01:19:55,423 --> 01:19:57,173
Are you OK to drive?

1031
01:19:58,673 --> 01:20:00,423
I'm a traffic cop, aren't I?

1032
01:20:20,965 --> 01:20:22,298
Vitya...

1033
01:20:31,131 --> 01:20:34,006
Well, we'll be off.

1034
01:20:35,131 --> 01:20:36,964
So just, you know...

1035
01:21:08,881 --> 01:21:10,089
Kolya...

1036
01:21:22,464 --> 01:21:24,464
Do you want a child?

1037
01:21:57,380 --> 01:21:59,546
Hello? Yes, Vadim.

1038
01:22:00,713 --> 01:22:02,380
Yes, I recognised you.

1039
01:22:06,421 --> 01:22:08,380
Sure, let's meet.

1040
01:22:10,380 --> 01:22:11,880
I'm at the hotel.

1041
01:22:15,379 --> 01:22:17,171
Half an hour is good.

1042
01:22:30,879 --> 01:22:32,588
Can I see those?

1043
01:22:32,713 --> 01:22:33,921
These?

1044
01:22:38,837 --> 01:22:40,337
- Here you are.
- Thanks.

1045
01:23:06,795 --> 01:23:08,670
Well, get in.

1046
01:23:09,462 --> 01:23:11,920
I won't bite. Come on!

1047
01:23:12,712 --> 01:23:13,795
You're a tough guy.

1048
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:15,379
If I'm not back here in two hours...

1049
01:23:15,462 --> 01:23:17,628
You will be, don't worry.

1050
01:23:28,962 --> 01:23:30,753
Rough night?

1051
01:23:30,878 --> 01:23:32,545
You're all puffy.

1052
01:23:32,628 --> 01:23:34,337
Where are we going?

1053
01:23:34,462 --> 01:23:36,378
You'll see.

1054
01:23:36,462 --> 01:23:38,253
You'll like it.

1055
01:23:38,336 --> 01:23:40,128
We'll sit and talk things over.

1056
01:23:40,253 --> 01:23:41,295
What things?

1057
01:23:41,420 --> 01:23:44,878
What do you mean?
You want money, right?

1058
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:47,545
And I want guarantees.

1059
01:23:47,628 --> 01:23:49,128
Guarantees of what?

1060
01:23:49,253 --> 01:23:51,753
See, we're already talking.

1061
01:23:54,795 --> 01:23:57,920
Just a quick tete-a-tete, you know.

1062
01:25:20,585 --> 01:25:21,626
So,

1063
01:25:22,335 --> 01:25:23,918
how does it feel?

1064
01:25:26,001 --> 01:25:27,835
Why did you hit him in the face?

1065
01:25:28,418 --> 01:25:29,418
Although...

1066
01:25:29,543 --> 01:25:30,543
Ruslan!

1067
01:25:32,418 --> 01:25:33,668
Nothing to say?

1068
01:25:36,293 --> 01:25:39,251
No last words? No?

1069
01:25:41,501 --> 01:25:45,043
Not even a few
for your daughter maybe?

1070
01:25:46,126 --> 01:25:48,126
- What?
- That's enough.

1071
01:25:48,209 --> 01:25:51,334
Fine. We'll honour your last wish.

1072
01:26:30,834 --> 01:26:33,750
A public-private partnership.

1073
01:26:33,792 --> 01:26:35,667
A spot with great potential.

1074
01:26:35,750 --> 01:26:38,709
Close to the centre, by the sea.

1075
01:26:40,792 --> 01:26:42,167
I'm very happy,

1076
01:26:42,584 --> 01:26:45,333
because this is a brand of sorts.

1077
01:26:45,458 --> 01:26:47,375
I mean, your brand.

1078
01:26:47,458 --> 01:26:52,167
And people trust brands these days.
Officials hold high hopes for them.

1079
01:26:56,250 --> 01:26:59,958
The main thing now is
to keep the momentum.

1080
01:27:00,875 --> 01:27:05,000
The desire to make headway,
to work and move things forward.

1081
01:27:08,541 --> 01:27:10,958
I'll send my guy over today.

1082
01:27:11,041 --> 01:27:12,416
No, no, today.

1083
01:27:12,958 --> 01:27:14,250
It's a deal then.

1084
01:27:22,750 --> 01:27:25,000
What do you mean, "crystal"?

1085
01:27:25,750 --> 01:27:27,874
That's your problem.

1086
01:27:27,958 --> 01:27:31,333
I told you loud and clear:
you get going, whatever it takes.

1087
01:27:31,416 --> 01:27:35,458
If you can't get going,
we'll find someone who can.

1088
01:27:36,624 --> 01:27:37,833
All right, back to work.

1089
01:32:11,537 --> 01:32:13,203
So, how??s Kolya?

1090
01:32:13,328 --> 01:32:15,537
He threatened to kill you both.

1091
01:32:15,662 --> 01:32:18,370
Then had a few drinks
and calmed down.

1092
01:32:20,536 --> 01:32:22,203
He loves you.

1093
01:32:26,453 --> 01:32:27,953
What about the other one?

1094
01:32:29,620 --> 01:32:31,536
Did he ask you to go to Moscow?

1095
01:35:41,242 --> 01:35:43,033
OK, fine.

1096
01:35:43,575 --> 01:35:46,492
Come pick it up.
But make it quick, OK?

1097
01:35:56,658 --> 01:35:58,950
He's taking the boat tomorrow.

1098
01:36:04,741 --> 01:36:06,991
I'm selling it all off for nothing.

1099
01:36:12,949 --> 01:36:16,949
If that bastard builds himself
a palace here, I'll burn it down.

1100
01:36:18,949 --> 01:36:20,741
Hey, wandering spirit!

1101
01:36:22,324 --> 01:36:24,366
Why did you leave your phone?

1102
01:36:27,824 --> 01:36:28,949
Roma!

1103
01:36:51,907 --> 01:36:52,907
Listen...

1104
01:36:53,074 --> 01:36:54,365
What do you want?

1105
01:36:55,074 --> 01:36:58,157
You ruined everything!
It's all because of you!

1106
01:36:58,240 --> 01:36:59,532
I hate you!

1107
01:36:59,699 --> 01:37:01,199
What is it, Roma?

1108
01:37:01,740 --> 01:37:04,824
I don't want to live with you
anymore! I'm sick of you!

1109
01:37:04,907 --> 01:37:06,199
Son, calm down.

1110
01:37:06,365 --> 01:37:09,115
- Stay away from me!
- Stop it...

1111
01:37:09,824 --> 01:37:11,240
What's with you?

1112
01:37:14,032 --> 01:37:15,490
Get her out of here, Dad!

1113
01:37:15,573 --> 01:37:17,032
Get out!

1114
01:37:18,240 --> 01:37:19,532
Dad...

1115
01:37:21,157 --> 01:37:23,573
It's going to be OK.

1116
01:40:39,154 --> 01:40:40,653
What?

1117
01:40:40,820 --> 01:40:42,903
Forgive her. She's...

1118
01:40:45,820 --> 01:40:47,362
She's a good person.

1119
01:40:47,487 --> 01:40:49,653
Have you forgiven her?

1120
01:40:49,778 --> 01:40:51,153
I'm trying.

1121
01:40:54,362 --> 01:40:56,153
OK, better get going.

1122
01:41:22,486 --> 01:41:24,444
Put it down here.

1123
01:41:33,653 --> 01:41:34,694
Hey.

1124
01:41:34,861 --> 01:41:36,736
- Where's Lilya?
- She didn't come today.

1125
01:41:36,861 --> 01:41:39,111
- What?
- I'm serious.

1126
01:41:41,361 --> 01:41:44,069
I tried calling her too -
says "number unavailable".

1127
01:41:44,152 --> 01:41:46,027
Isn't she home?

1128
01:41:47,111 --> 01:41:48,736
Number unavailable.

1129
01:41:48,861 --> 01:41:50,736
OK, I??ll be off.

1130
01:41:51,861 --> 01:41:53,361
Can you give me a lift?

1131
01:41:53,861 --> 01:41:56,236
- What?
- Can I get a lift?

1132
01:41:56,361 --> 01:41:58,361
Oh, sure, get in.

1133
01:44:05,984 --> 01:44:08,733
She ran off to him. To Moscow.

1134
01:44:08,817 --> 01:44:11,025
I don't doubt it for a second.

1135
01:44:13,233 --> 01:44:15,442
What else could have happened?

1136
01:44:15,525 --> 01:44:18,650
Anything. Do you know
how many people go missing?

1137
01:44:18,775 --> 01:44:20,567
I don't believe in "anything".

1138
01:44:20,650 --> 01:44:22,483
What about the cops?

1139
01:44:23,192 --> 01:44:24,525
What about them?

1140
01:44:25,608 --> 01:44:27,400
Have to wait three days.

1141
01:44:27,525 --> 01:44:28,900
That's a bunch of shit.

1142
01:44:28,983 --> 01:44:30,525
You can report it right away.

1143
01:44:30,650 --> 01:44:34,775
Take it from the wife
of a law enforcement officer.

1144
01:44:35,108 --> 01:44:36,066
OK,

1145
01:44:36,566 --> 01:44:39,108
I go to the cops and tell them what?

1146
01:44:39,233 --> 01:44:42,275
"My wife ran off to Moscow
to her lover.

1147
01:44:42,400 --> 01:44:46,608
"Here's her name and number.
Get her back."

1148
01:44:47,483 --> 01:44:50,150
Hey, if you want,
I can call him right now.

1149
01:44:50,566 --> 01:44:52,233
I already tried over and over.

1150
01:44:52,316 --> 01:44:53,483
And?

1151
01:44:53,566 --> 01:44:55,649
Nothing. No answer.

1152
01:44:56,316 --> 01:44:58,358
We have to do something.

1153
01:45:05,483 --> 01:45:06,941
And I wouldn't be surprised

1154
01:45:07,066 --> 01:45:11,399
if he took my money
from that bastard and bailed.

1155
01:45:11,524 --> 01:45:13,774
And she joined him later.

1156
01:46:18,815 --> 01:46:20,315
Hi, Kolya.

1157
01:46:21,523 --> 01:46:22,648
Where's Roma?

1158
01:46:22,815 --> 01:46:24,606
He went home.

1159
01:46:25,481 --> 01:46:28,273
- When?
- About 20 minutes ago.

1160
01:47:30,189 --> 01:47:31,939
Get the door!

1161
01:47:58,521 --> 01:48:00,063
They found her.

1162
01:49:14,937 --> 01:49:16,604
Move away.

1163
01:49:17,645 --> 01:49:19,187
Come on.

1164
01:49:55,603 --> 01:49:56,895
Why?

1165
01:50:01,728 --> 01:50:03,644
Why, Lord?

1166
01:50:43,394 --> 01:50:44,561
What can I get you, Kolya?

1167
01:50:44,686 --> 01:50:46,935
Vodka, what else? 2 bottles.

1168
01:50:55,310 --> 01:50:56,810
Hello, Kolya.

1169
01:50:57,519 --> 01:50:59,435
Hey, Father Vasily.

1170
01:51:30,435 --> 01:51:31,893
Well?

1171
01:51:33,726 --> 01:51:35,226
Where's your...

1172
01:51:35,351 --> 01:51:38,393
merciful God Almighty?

1173
01:51:40,101 --> 01:51:41,893
Mine is with me.

1174
01:51:42,435 --> 01:51:44,435
As for yours, I wouldn't know.

1175
01:51:46,310 --> 01:51:48,268
Who do you pray to?

1176
01:51:49,768 --> 01:51:51,976
Haven't seen you in church.

1177
01:51:53,601 --> 01:51:56,309
You don't fast, take communion
or go to confession.

1178
01:51:56,434 --> 01:52:00,559
If I lit candles and all,
would things be different?

1179
01:52:00,726 --> 01:52:03,518
Maybe it's not too late to start?

1180
01:52:04,143 --> 01:52:06,393
Would I get my wife
back from the dead?

1181
01:52:06,518 --> 01:52:08,351
And my house?

1182
01:52:08,726 --> 01:52:10,476
Or is it too late?

1183
01:52:11,184 --> 01:52:12,392
I don't know.

1184
01:52:12,559 --> 01:52:14,934
Our Lord moves in mysterious ways.

1185
01:52:15,059 --> 01:52:16,809
You don't know?

1186
01:52:16,892 --> 01:52:20,559
Then why do you call me
to confession?

1187
01:52:22,267 --> 01:52:23,976
What do you know then?

1188
01:52:24,142 --> 01:52:26,226
- Want some?
- No.

1189
01:52:30,809 --> 01:52:33,642
"Can you pull in Leviathan
with a fishhook

1190
01:52:34,392 --> 01:52:37,059
"or tie down its tongue with a rope?

1191
01:52:37,684 --> 01:52:40,267
"Will it keep begging you for mercy?

1192
01:52:40,350 --> 01:52:43,684
"Will it speak to you
with gentle words?

1193
01:52:44,225 --> 01:52:46,684
"Nothing on earth is its equal.

1194
01:52:47,350 --> 01:52:49,517
"It is king over all that are proud."

1195
01:52:49,600 --> 01:52:51,100
Father Vasily...

1196
01:52:52,308 --> 01:52:54,850
I'm talking to you
as a regular person.

1197
01:52:54,975 --> 01:52:57,058
Why the fucking riddles?

1198
01:52:57,183 --> 01:52:58,683
What for?

1199
01:52:58,850 --> 01:53:01,725
Have you heard of a man called Job?

1200
01:53:02,183 --> 01:53:05,683
Like you, he was preoccupied
with the meaning of life.

1201
01:53:05,808 --> 01:53:08,517
"Why?" he asked.
"Why me of all people?"

1202
01:53:08,642 --> 01:53:11,766
He worried so much
he became covered with scabs.

1203
01:53:11,850 --> 01:53:15,683
His wife tried to talk some sense
into him; his friends told him

1204
01:53:16,141 --> 01:53:17,808
to not evoke God's anger.

1205
01:53:17,891 --> 01:53:21,766
But he kept kicking up dust
and sprinkling ash on his head.

1206
01:53:21,808 --> 01:53:24,725
Then the Lord relented

1207
01:53:24,850 --> 01:53:26,308
and appeared to him

1208
01:53:26,475 --> 01:53:28,475
in the form of a hurricane

1209
01:53:28,600 --> 01:53:31,725
and explained everything to him
in pictures.

1210
01:53:31,891 --> 01:53:33,016
And?

1211
01:53:33,516 --> 01:53:35,766
Job resigned himself to his fate

1212
01:53:35,849 --> 01:53:38,308
and lived to be 140.

1213
01:53:38,433 --> 01:53:42,474
Got to see 4 generations
of his family

1214
01:53:43,099 --> 01:53:45,183
and died old

1215
01:53:45,308 --> 01:53:46,474
and content.

1216
01:53:46,641 --> 01:53:48,141
Is that a fairy tale?

1217
01:53:51,724 --> 01:53:52,974
No,

1218
01:53:53,391 --> 01:53:55,432
it's in the Bible.

1219
01:53:55,557 --> 01:53:58,682
Let me help you carry that.
Come on.

1220
01:54:11,349 --> 01:54:12,599
Thanks.

1221
01:54:14,515 --> 01:54:18,265
The funeral service is tomorrow.
They just called.

1222
01:54:32,640 --> 01:54:34,724
Yulia, there's some bread for you.

1223
01:54:34,890 --> 01:54:36,140
God bless you.

1224
01:54:36,265 --> 01:54:38,557
Glory be to God. Eat up.

1225
01:54:54,890 --> 01:54:56,223
How terrible...

1226
01:55:00,806 --> 01:55:03,681
Do you think she did this herself?

1227
01:55:04,348 --> 01:55:06,140
The forensic tests will tell.

1228
01:55:12,931 --> 01:55:14,348
Remember

1229
01:55:15,181 --> 01:55:17,848
how Kolya threatened to kill her?

1230
01:55:17,973 --> 01:55:20,348
- Come on now.
- He did.

1231
01:55:20,514 --> 01:55:22,764
- So what?
- He could have done it.

1232
01:55:22,848 --> 01:55:25,181
He's capable, I swear.

1233
01:55:26,348 --> 01:55:28,014
- You hear me?
- What the hell?

1234
01:55:28,139 --> 01:55:30,473
- Did you hear me?
- I heard you.

1235
01:55:30,556 --> 01:55:33,431
- And?
- You're the cop. You tell me.

1236
01:55:35,181 --> 01:55:36,973
Use your brain.

1237
01:55:58,472 --> 01:55:59,597
Dad...

1238
01:56:01,722 --> 01:56:03,264
Will you ever stop drinking?

1239
01:56:03,347 --> 01:56:04,555
I will.

1240
01:56:05,639 --> 01:56:08,930
I'm quitting tomorrow.
You believe me?

1241
01:56:12,472 --> 01:56:13,764
Son...

1242
01:56:16,514 --> 01:56:19,138
Sit. Let's talk.

1243
01:56:19,305 --> 01:56:21,472
Forget it. I'm going out.

1244
01:56:30,138 --> 01:56:31,555
All right.

1245
01:56:35,597 --> 01:56:36,763
Go.

1246
01:56:44,763 --> 01:56:47,930
- Hello.
- Hi. Is your dad home?

1247
01:56:48,096 --> 01:56:50,263
- He's asleep.
- I see.

1248
01:56:50,721 --> 01:56:52,430
- Hey, where are you going?
- Easy, easy.

1249
01:56:52,555 --> 01:56:55,180
- Dad! Some guys just barged in!
- Sit down and be quiet.

1250
01:56:55,263 --> 01:56:57,138
- What?
- Sit down, I said.

1251
01:56:57,263 --> 01:57:00,096
Get up. Homicide department.

1252
01:57:00,263 --> 01:57:02,429
You ignored the court order.

1253
01:57:02,596 --> 01:57:04,263
What court order?

1254
01:57:04,804 --> 01:57:06,096
This one.

1255
01:57:11,513 --> 01:57:13,096
Roma!

1256
01:57:13,221 --> 01:57:14,721
Sit down!

1257
01:57:31,596 --> 01:57:32,804
Dad!

1258
01:57:55,929 --> 01:57:59,387
We have every reason to believe
you killed your wife

1259
01:57:59,512 --> 01:58:01,595
and then faked her drowning.

1260
01:58:02,470 --> 01:58:03,512
What?

1261
01:58:05,262 --> 01:58:06,262
Are you crazy?

1262
01:58:08,178 --> 01:58:10,303
We discovered signs of violence
on the body.

1263
01:58:10,345 --> 01:58:12,762
She was murdered,
then pushed into the water.

1264
01:58:12,887 --> 01:58:15,595
She died from a blow
with a blunt object

1265
01:58:15,720 --> 01:58:17,845
to the back of her head.

1266
01:58:17,928 --> 01:58:21,387
Not long before that,
she had sexual intercourse.

1267
01:58:21,512 --> 01:58:24,678
The investigation is looking
into the possibility of rape.

1268
01:58:25,470 --> 01:58:28,428
We'll take your sperm for tests.
Something tells me

1269
01:58:28,595 --> 01:58:30,636
it will be a match.

1270
01:58:31,970 --> 01:58:33,303
Next,

1271
01:58:34,428 --> 01:58:38,470
we have testimony
from Angela Polivanova

1272
01:58:39,636 --> 01:58:42,970
and her husband, Pasha Polivanov

1273
01:58:43,803 --> 01:58:47,219
to the effect that a few days
prior to the murder,

1274
01:58:47,344 --> 01:58:49,136
while at a picnic,

1275
01:58:49,261 --> 01:58:51,719
you had a fight with your wife

1276
01:58:51,886 --> 01:58:54,261
and her lover in front of witnesses.

1277
01:58:54,386 --> 01:58:56,803
after you caught them having sex.

1278
01:58:56,969 --> 01:58:59,136
You beat up the lover,

1279
01:58:59,303 --> 01:59:00,636
a man called Dmitri,

1280
01:59:01,178 --> 01:59:03,053
whose identity
is currently being established,

1281
01:59:03,136 --> 01:59:07,177
then hit your wife, and afterwards
threatened to kill them both.

1282
01:59:07,802 --> 01:59:09,927
This testimony was confirmed

1283
01:59:11,261 --> 01:59:13,344
by Ivan Stepanych Degtyaryev,

1284
01:59:14,094 --> 01:59:16,761
Lieutenant Colonel
of the traffic police,

1285
01:59:16,927 --> 01:59:20,136
who was also present.

1286
01:59:21,177 --> 01:59:24,511
In addition,
the suspected murder weapon,

1287
01:59:24,594 --> 01:59:28,302
a hammer with the shape matching
that of the Victim's head wound,

1288
01:59:29,177 --> 01:59:33,760
was found in a building
on your property.

1289
01:59:33,927 --> 01:59:35,927
It has been taken for testing.

1290
01:59:36,385 --> 01:59:39,260
Would you like to comment
on any of this?

1291
01:59:40,260 --> 01:59:43,302
Personally, I would advise you

1292
01:59:44,010 --> 01:59:45,802
to write a full confession.

1293
01:59:45,885 --> 01:59:48,177
We have more than enough evidence.

1294
01:59:48,260 --> 01:59:51,052
A confession may reduce the sentence.

1295
01:59:51,552 --> 01:59:53,718
Pursuant to Article 105 Part 1,

1296
01:59:54,218 --> 01:59:57,385
you'll get up to 15 years

1297
01:59:57,468 --> 01:59:59,927
unless there are
aggravating circumstances,

1298
02:00:00,052 --> 02:00:03,135
in which case,
it'll be up to 20 years.

1299
02:00:06,177 --> 02:00:07,552
Right...

1300
02:00:08,468 --> 02:00:11,385
In any case,
we're detaining you for 48 hours

1301
02:00:11,468 --> 02:00:13,468
as a murder suspect.

1302
02:00:14,468 --> 02:00:17,635
I'll petition the court
for a warrant for your arrest

1303
02:00:17,760 --> 02:00:22,843
as a flight risk and as someone
who might impede the investigation.

1304
02:00:29,718 --> 02:00:30,926
Also...

1305
02:00:31,509 --> 02:00:34,384
you have the right to a lawyer.

1306
02:00:34,509 --> 02:00:36,884
If you don't have a lawyer,

1307
02:00:37,009 --> 02:00:39,051
the state will appoint one for you.

1308
02:00:39,968 --> 02:00:41,634
Do you understand?

1309
02:00:44,926 --> 02:00:47,093
I don't understand any of this.

1310
02:00:47,843 --> 02:00:50,093
You'll have plenty of time
to think it over.

1311
02:01:39,717 --> 02:01:41,675
- Hello.
- Just one?

1312
02:01:41,758 --> 02:01:43,217
Just one.

1313
02:01:48,092 --> 02:01:49,300
Listen...

1314
02:01:50,758 --> 02:01:54,175
My son's left all alone.

1315
02:01:55,425 --> 02:01:56,883
We've got no relatives.

1316
02:01:57,008 --> 02:01:58,425
Don't shit yourself.

1317
02:01:59,091 --> 02:02:01,258
The state will take care of him.

1318
02:02:57,674 --> 02:03:00,340
Roma, open up.
It's Angela and Pasha.

1319
02:03:00,507 --> 02:03:02,049
Are you alone?

1320
02:03:02,174 --> 02:03:03,340
Yes, it's just us.

1321
02:03:09,257 --> 02:03:10,715
How are you?

1322
02:03:11,215 --> 02:03:12,549
I'm all right.

1323
02:03:13,215 --> 02:03:16,340
Why didn't you call me
when they took your dad?

1324
02:03:17,257 --> 02:03:19,173
I don't have your number.

1325
02:03:21,882 --> 02:03:24,090
How long have you
been here alone?

1326
02:03:24,215 --> 02:03:25,423
I don't know.

1327
02:03:26,298 --> 02:03:28,340
5 days, I think.

1328
02:03:29,673 --> 02:03:30,882
Roma...

1329
02:03:32,340 --> 02:03:34,340
A lawyer called.

1330
02:03:35,423 --> 02:03:38,131
Your dad was accused
of murdering Lilya.

1331
02:03:39,006 --> 02:03:43,131
He'll be in jail till the trial.
Then, they'll take him to prison.

1332
02:03:44,340 --> 02:03:46,131
They have proof.

1333
02:03:46,215 --> 02:03:47,590
That's not true.

1334
02:03:47,673 --> 02:03:49,631
Why would I lie to you?

1335
02:03:51,881 --> 02:03:55,131
Why didn't he call me?
They must let him call me.

1336
02:03:55,256 --> 02:03:56,840
Look, Roma,

1337
02:03:57,631 --> 02:04:00,839
the lawyer said that
if there's no one to take care of you,

1338
02:04:00,964 --> 02:04:02,631
they'll put you in an orphanage.

1339
02:04:03,464 --> 02:04:05,589
I can take care of myself.

1340
02:04:05,673 --> 02:04:08,714
By law, until you turn 18,

1341
02:04:08,839 --> 02:04:12,173
you must live
in an orphanage or with a guardian.

1342
02:04:13,089 --> 02:04:15,298
Pasha and I talked it over...

1343
02:04:15,923 --> 02:04:18,256
We'd like to be your guardians.

1344
02:04:18,339 --> 02:04:20,256
You've got no one else, right?

1345
02:04:26,297 --> 02:04:27,714
Is it because of the money?

1346
02:04:28,297 --> 02:04:29,631
What money?

1347
02:04:29,756 --> 02:04:31,422
Won't you get paid for it?

1348
02:04:31,547 --> 02:04:33,339
How should I know?

1349
02:04:34,839 --> 02:04:38,297
But if you agree,
I'll definitely find out.

1350
02:04:38,422 --> 02:04:41,422
I guess the state
would probably help out,

1351
02:04:42,089 --> 02:04:44,130
but that's not why we're offering.

1352
02:04:44,714 --> 02:04:46,339
Why then?

1353
02:04:47,505 --> 02:04:48,880
I don't know.

1354
02:04:50,214 --> 02:04:51,505
You're like...

1355
02:04:52,214 --> 02:04:53,714
family to us.

1356
02:04:54,422 --> 02:04:56,047
Your mum and I were friends.

1357
02:04:56,214 --> 02:04:59,214
You were little when she died.

1358
02:05:00,547 --> 02:05:04,672
I went to school with your parents.
And Lilya. She was a bit younger.

1359
02:05:16,630 --> 02:05:18,255
I'll step out for a smoke.

1360
02:07:18,086 --> 02:07:21,170
Pribrezhny Town Court
has ruled as follows:

1361
02:07:21,295 --> 02:07:24,920
The Panel of Judges,

1362
02:07:25,003 --> 02:07:30,544
presided over by Mrs Tarasova,
examined Mr Sergeyev's petition

1363
02:07:30,669 --> 02:07:33,586
to appeal the ruling
on case No. 06-18.

1364
02:07:33,711 --> 02:07:37,503
In the presence of Mr Sergeyev,
the court has determined that:

1365
02:07:37,628 --> 02:07:40,461
Mr Sergeyev,
who has no previous convictions,

1366
02:07:40,586 --> 02:07:43,961
is convicted in accordance
with Article 105 of the Criminal Code

1367
02:07:44,044 --> 02:07:47,628
and sentenced to 15 years
in a maximum-security penitentiary.

1368
02:07:47,752 --> 02:07:50,544
The ruling also addressed
evidence in the case:

1369
02:07:50,627 --> 02:07:55,252
Mr Sergeyev was convicted
of premeditated murder of his wife.

1370
02:07:55,377 --> 02:07:59,044
The circumstances of the crime
are outlined in the ruling.

1371
02:07:59,169 --> 02:08:01,711
Mr Sergeyev refused
to confess to the crime.

1372
02:08:01,836 --> 02:08:06,252
He filed an appeal requesting
that the ruling be repealed.

1373
02:08:06,336 --> 02:08:10,460
Mr Sergeyev claims that his guilt
in the case was not proven.

1374
02:08:10,585 --> 02:08:15,502
The court considers the ruling
not subject to repeal.

1375
02:08:15,960 --> 02:08:19,169
All circumstances
were thoroughly examined by the court

1376
02:08:19,294 --> 02:08:21,502
and all evidence
given due consideration.

1377
02:08:21,627 --> 02:08:25,169
The defendant's claim of innocence
was reviewed by the court

1378
02:08:25,294 --> 02:08:26,502
and soundly rejected.

1379
02:08:47,960 --> 02:08:49,293
Hello?

1380
02:08:53,751 --> 02:08:55,376
15 years?

1381
02:08:55,501 --> 02:08:57,293
Well, thank God.

1382
02:08:57,418 --> 02:09:00,043
That'll teach him to know his place.

1383
02:09:01,460 --> 02:09:03,251
Yeah, later.

1384
02:09:09,168 --> 02:09:10,626
One more.

1385
02:09:30,168 --> 02:09:35,334
We probably don't even realise yet
what is really happening.

1386
02:09:36,084 --> 02:09:38,459
We are reawakening

1387
02:09:39,251 --> 02:09:41,709
the soul of the Russian people.

1388
02:09:42,751 --> 02:09:47,584
As the Great Prince
St. Alexander Nevsky

1389
02:09:47,751 --> 02:09:50,042
wonderfully put it:

1390
02:09:50,126 --> 02:09:53,834
"God dwells not in strength,
but in truth."

1391
02:09:53,917 --> 02:09:57,709
And he was right:
not with strength, but with love;

1392
02:09:57,792 --> 02:09:59,542
not with cunning,

1393
02:09:59,625 --> 02:10:01,875
but with the Lord's wisdom;

1394
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:05,167
not with anger and hatred,
but with bravery

1395
02:10:05,292 --> 02:10:09,709
have we overcome the many enemies
of our faith and our Motherland.

1396
02:10:10,792 --> 02:10:14,042
But the most important thing today

1397
02:10:14,875 --> 02:10:17,208
is that we must

1398
02:10:17,375 --> 02:10:19,417
uphold the Orthodox faith

1399
02:10:19,542 --> 02:10:21,708
and always speak truthfully.

1400
02:10:22,208 --> 02:10:23,750
Truth

1401
02:10:23,875 --> 02:10:26,375
is God's legacy.

1402
02:10:26,458 --> 02:10:31,167
Truth reflects the world
as it really is, without distortion.

1403
02:10:31,875 --> 02:10:37,041
But only he who knows God's truth
can find truth.

1404
02:10:37,125 --> 02:10:40,916
And God's truth
is Christ Himself.

1405
02:10:41,041 --> 02:10:43,541
This is why, when Apostle Paul said,

1406
02:10:43,666 --> 02:10:47,083
"I no longer live,
but Christ lives in me"

1407
02:10:48,291 --> 02:10:52,125
he meant that when a man
lets Christ into his soul -

1408
02:10:52,833 --> 02:10:55,250
in other words,
begins to think like Christ,

1409
02:10:55,333 --> 02:10:56,999
see like Christ

1410
02:10:57,124 --> 02:11:00,333
and act like the Lord commanded -

1411
02:11:00,458 --> 02:11:04,791
only then does this man
possess truth.

1412
02:11:05,499 --> 02:11:08,041
And that means he can regard events

1413
02:11:08,958 --> 02:11:11,249
and see their true meaning

1414
02:11:11,333 --> 02:11:14,666
and tell good from evil.

1415
02:11:14,791 --> 02:11:18,124
And that is the essence of truth.

1416
02:11:18,249 --> 02:11:22,291
When people destroy crosses,

1417
02:11:22,374 --> 02:11:26,249
break icons, defile the Crucifix

1418
02:11:27,166 --> 02:11:30,166
and blaspheme by calling
demonic rites a prayer,

1419
02:11:30,291 --> 02:11:33,124
when people try to convince others

1420
02:11:33,291 --> 02:11:36,249
that they do this
out of good intentions,

1421
02:11:36,332 --> 02:11:38,082
they are passing off lies

1422
02:11:38,207 --> 02:11:40,540
as the truth.

1423
02:11:40,624 --> 02:11:42,415
How can one

1424
02:11:42,540 --> 02:11:46,374
preach freedom
while destroying the foundations

1425
02:11:46,457 --> 02:11:48,540
of morality?

1426
02:11:48,624 --> 02:11:52,457
Freedom is finding God's truth.

1427
02:11:52,582 --> 02:11:55,249
The Bible teaches us this.

1428
02:11:55,374 --> 02:11:59,415
Know God's truth,
and it shall set you free.

1429
02:12:01,332 --> 02:12:05,373
Only man who knows God's truth,
who lives by it,

1430
02:12:05,457 --> 02:12:07,415
who defends it -

1431
02:12:07,540 --> 02:12:10,082
only that man is truly free.

1432
02:12:11,290 --> 02:12:15,748
My beloved brothers and sisters
in Christ!

1433
02:12:15,915 --> 02:12:21,373
The world today is constantly
changing its reference points.

1434
02:12:21,998 --> 02:12:24,498
True values

1435
02:12:25,040 --> 02:12:27,248
are being replaced with false ones.

1436
02:12:27,373 --> 02:12:30,581
But even in this world,

1437
02:12:31,540 --> 02:12:35,206
our path remains unchanged:
it leads to Christ.

1438
02:12:35,331 --> 02:12:39,373
We know that the Church
will protect and guide us

1439
02:12:39,540 --> 02:12:43,164
but the Church consists
of you and me.

1440
02:12:43,248 --> 02:12:44,789
God is with us.

1441
02:12:44,873 --> 02:12:47,706
Truth is with us.
The Lord's love is with us...

1442
02:12:49,289 --> 02:12:51,539
God sees everything, son.

1443
02:12:51,623 --> 02:12:56,456
And in defending our faith, we will
not liken ourselves to our enemies

1444
02:12:56,539 --> 02:12:58,081
but just as Christ

1445
02:12:58,206 --> 02:13:02,206
shed light on the truth
and unmasked the lies with one word,

1446
02:13:02,331 --> 02:13:05,872
so will we,
enlightened by the Church,

1447
02:13:06,372 --> 02:13:09,122
the World of God and saintly prayer

1448
02:13:09,206 --> 02:13:11,372
defend the Orthodox faith.

1449
02:13:12,706 --> 02:13:14,997
I'm so glad
that you're pleased, sir.

1450
02:13:15,122 --> 02:13:17,331
Thanks a lot. We try.

1451
02:13:21,081 --> 02:13:24,497
It's not quite finished yet,
but it will be soon.

1452
02:13:25,247 --> 02:13:29,330
We'll do some landscaping,
maybe build a refectory.

1453
02:13:29,414 --> 02:13:32,330
As soon as it's all finished,
I'll call you right away.

1454
02:13:33,330 --> 02:13:36,289
- I have every faith in you.
- Thank you so much.

1455
02:13:36,997 --> 02:13:38,330
Where's my family?

1456
02:13:38,497 --> 02:13:40,789
Come on, sweetie, get in the car.

1457
02:15:58,453 --> 02:16:02,453
Technical work: jafforidza
