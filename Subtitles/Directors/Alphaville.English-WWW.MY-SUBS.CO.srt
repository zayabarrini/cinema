1
00:01:07,717 --> 00:01:13,769
Sometimes,
reality is too complex

2
00:01:15,044 --> 00:01:17,235
for oral communication

3
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:24,795
But legend embodies it
in a form

4
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,888
which enables it to spread
all over the world

5
00:02:18,783 --> 00:02:21,440
It was 24.17, Oceanic Time

6
00:02:22,014 --> 00:02:24,500
when I approached
the suburbs of Alphaville

7
00:02:25,177 --> 00:02:27,505
Silence. Logic.
Security. Prudence

8
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:11,565
My paper reserved
a room for me:

9
00:03:11,966 --> 00:03:14,294
- You are?
- Ivan Johnson

10
00:03:14,564 --> 00:03:16,960
- Which paper?
- Figaro-Pravda

11
00:03:17,861 --> 00:03:20,256
Room 344. Have you registered
at Residents Control?

12
00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:24,953
You must, even if you're
a Festival visitor

13
00:03:27,385 --> 00:03:28,577
Your bag, sir

14
00:04:00,454 --> 00:04:03,645
- Please, sir.
- Nothing. Get lost

15
00:04:04,017 --> 00:04:05,379
This way, sir

16
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:14,737
You're tired, sir?

17
00:04:18,704 --> 00:04:20,292
You wish to sleep, sir?

18
00:04:28,028 --> 00:04:29,186
It's this way, sir

19
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,541
If you're tired,
you can rest, sir

20
00:04:49,575 --> 00:04:50,505
Here it is, sir

21
00:05:08,823 --> 00:05:10,253
The bedroom's here, sir

22
00:05:38,861 --> 00:05:41,450
- What are you looking for now?
- I'm checking if the Bible's here

23
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,714
- Everyone has one.
- Do you believe that?

24
00:05:44,222 --> 00:05:45,482
Yes, of course

25
00:05:47,586 --> 00:05:49,913
I'll leave you the tranquillizers
in the bathroom

26
00:05:52,782 --> 00:05:55,302
I'm very well.
Thank you so very much

27
00:06:03,771 --> 00:06:07,723
- Are you going to take a bath, sir?
- Yes, I must reflect

28
00:06:09,766 --> 00:06:11,253
I'll help you, sir

29
00:06:16,226 --> 00:06:17,690
And your tie, sir

30
00:06:35,507 --> 00:06:39,129
- Now what? -I'll take a bath
with you, sir, if you like

31
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,561
Listen, doll, I'm a big boy

32
00:06:42,734 --> 00:06:44,722
I can find dames all alone

33
00:06:45,298 --> 00:06:46,593
Now get lost

34
00:06:48,795 --> 00:06:50,884
Be polite to the ladies,
Mr. Johnson

35
00:06:51,792 --> 00:06:53,722
Shit. Now what?

36
00:06:55,055 --> 00:06:56,543
This kid doesn't please you?

37
00:06:57,487 --> 00:06:59,451
And your sister, sir?

38
00:07:27,658 --> 00:07:29,747
- I'm getting out of shape.
- What sir?

39
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,742
What's going on here?
Are you on drugs or what?

40
00:07:36,183 --> 00:07:38,306
No, it's normal, sir

41
00:07:38,448 --> 00:07:41,877
All things weird are normal
in this whore of cities

42
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:43,407
Sit in that chair

43
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:00,219
Her name was Beatrice

44
00:08:00,927 --> 00:08:04,651
She said she was a seductress,
third class

45
00:08:05,756 --> 00:08:09,480
I was struck by the sadness
and durability of her face

46
00:08:10,818 --> 00:08:15,246
Something's not in orbit
in the capital of this Galaxy

47
00:08:20,908 --> 00:08:22,271
Hold this up

48
00:08:38,858 --> 00:08:41,480
Not bad for a veteran
of Guadalcanal

49
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:43,449
Just what I was thinking
about you

50
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:47,106
Go play your games
with someone else

51
00:08:47,283 --> 00:08:49,611
I've heard it before

52
00:08:55,176 --> 00:08:56,935
Yes? Mr. Johnson

53
00:09:02,469 --> 00:09:08,725
Miss Natasha Von Braun
calls for you

54
00:09:10,361 --> 00:09:12,189
Just a moment, please

55
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,908
Leonard Von Braun, inventor
of the death ray

56
00:09:24,082 --> 00:09:25,671
bring back alive, or liquidate

57
00:09:29,543 --> 00:09:31,632
Tell her to wait,
I'll be down in 5 minutes

58
00:09:31,907 --> 00:09:34,133
She's on her way up

59
00:09:43,064 --> 00:09:46,584
Henry Dickson, Agent X21,
12, Enrico Fermi, Alphaville

60
00:10:03,578 --> 00:10:04,668
Got a light?

61
00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:10,065
I've traveled 9,000 kilometers
to give it to you

62
00:10:14,002 --> 00:10:16,726
- I'm Natasha Von Braun.
- Yes, I know

63
00:10:17,698 --> 00:10:18,856
How do you know?

64
00:10:20,795 --> 00:10:22,657
You are Miss Von Braun

65
00:10:22,793 --> 00:10:25,780
Yes, I'm very well,
thank you so very much

66
00:10:28,621 --> 00:10:31,050
You come from the Outlands,
Mr. Johnson?

67
00:10:34,948 --> 00:10:37,105
- Everything to your satisfaction?
- Yes

68
00:10:41,676 --> 00:10:44,071
I've been ordered to stay
in your service

69
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,227
during your stay in Alphaville

70
00:10:46,804 --> 00:10:48,291
Who ordered you?

71
00:10:49,934 --> 00:10:51,364
The authorities, of course

72
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,980
You came for the festival,
Mr. Johnson?

73
00:11:01,423 --> 00:11:02,581
Which festival?

74
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:09,207
The big one; that's why people
from the Outlands come

75
00:11:11,015 --> 00:11:14,444
- In my opinion, it's silly
you did not. -Why?

76
00:11:15,976 --> 00:11:21,631
The festival's nearly over;
No more until next year

77
00:11:23,303 --> 00:11:24,824
You don't say

78
00:11:30,729 --> 00:11:32,058
Yes, Mr. Johnson

79
00:11:35,991 --> 00:11:40,215
But this evening,
there's a gala reception

80
00:11:43,017 --> 00:11:44,312
Very big

81
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:54,700
At a ministry. I'm going;
come if you like

82
00:11:57,171 --> 00:11:58,396
OK.

83
00:12:02,232 --> 00:12:06,388
What time? I must attend
to something else first

84
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:09,691
You must go to
Residents Control registration?

85
00:12:09,858 --> 00:12:11,118
No. What's that?

86
00:12:11,691 --> 00:12:16,744
You mustn't forget to go there,
Mr. Johnson. We can meet afterwards

87
00:12:16,918 --> 00:12:21,404
No, I'll go there tomorrow.
First I must meet a friend

88
00:12:21,581 --> 00:12:23,170
Me too, I've work to do

89
00:12:23,712 --> 00:12:25,767
I'll give you the address
where I'll be

90
00:12:26,643 --> 00:12:29,833
Call for me
and we'll go together

91
00:12:30,306 --> 00:12:32,294
OK. In an hour or two

92
00:12:33,469 --> 00:12:35,490
All right, see you later,
Mr. Johnson

93
00:12:36,867 --> 00:12:38,388
I'll go down with you, miss

94
00:12:46,723 --> 00:12:51,152
Mr. Johnson, what's it like
in the Outlands?

95
00:12:51,719 --> 00:12:53,478
You've never been?

96
00:12:53,651 --> 00:12:59,101
No, but my father told me about
them when I was little

97
00:12:59,878 --> 00:13:02,069
Now it's forbidden to think
about them

98
00:13:02,242 --> 00:13:05,296
Are you often ordered
to stay with strangers?

99
00:13:05,473 --> 00:13:09,197
- Yes, it's my job.
- Sometimes, it must be nice

100
00:13:09,402 --> 00:13:12,956
- Why?
- You never have love affairs?

101
00:13:13,132 --> 00:13:16,686
- What? -Has no one ever fallen
in love with you?

102
00:13:17,262 --> 00:13:19,919
In love? What's that?

103
00:13:21,058 --> 00:13:23,953
There's one thing I'd like
to know, miss

104
00:13:24,122 --> 00:13:26,381
- Yes, Mr. Johnson.
- You've finished taking me

105
00:13:26,553 --> 00:13:29,016
- for an ass, or are you beginning?
- Let go of me

106
00:13:30,482 --> 00:13:32,003
But answer me

107
00:13:32,514 --> 00:13:34,978
I don't understand,
what are you talking about?

108
00:13:35,144 --> 00:13:39,834
Realize, Princess. I don't know
what you're talking about either

109
00:13:53,528 --> 00:13:57,082
It's always like that.
You never understand anything

110
00:14:09,413 --> 00:14:13,069
Yes, it's always like that.
You never understand anything

111
00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:15,972
And one night,
you end it in death

112
00:14:28,894 --> 00:14:32,584
- Which way are you going?
- 12, Enrico Fermi

113
00:14:33,124 --> 00:14:37,609
That's after Heisenberg Boulevard,
not far from Mathematical Park

114
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:41,076
I have a car, I can give you
a lift, if you wish. -OK.

115
00:14:41,582 --> 00:14:43,046
I'll get the keys

116
00:14:55,536 --> 00:14:58,727
- You don't want me to court you?
- What?

117
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,923
You really don't know
what it means?

118
00:15:06,526 --> 00:15:09,012
Her smile and her small,
pointed teeth

119
00:15:09,189 --> 00:15:11,914
reminded me of the old
vampire films

120
00:15:12,087 --> 00:15:15,447
the sort they used to show
at cinerama museums

121
00:15:42,557 --> 00:15:44,215
I'm a programmer, second class

122
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,077
Natasha's a name from the past

123
00:15:49,751 --> 00:15:53,078
Yes, but in life, one can
only know the present

124
00:15:53,748 --> 00:15:58,335
No one's lived in the past,
or will live in the future

125
00:16:00,241 --> 00:16:01,865
Thanks for the lift, anyway

126
00:16:04,471 --> 00:16:06,900
It's a pleasure to do my job,
Mr. Johnson

127
00:16:09,332 --> 00:16:10,388
It's much farther?

128
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:21,383
You know we must cross
the North Zone, Miss

129
00:16:21,555 --> 00:16:23,416
What's the population
of Alphaville?

130
00:16:23,719 --> 00:16:26,013
Don't forget, you must go
to Residents Control

131
00:16:26,184 --> 00:16:27,171
Yes

132
00:16:28,215 --> 00:16:30,872
What exactly do you do
for a living?

133
00:16:31,145 --> 00:16:32,473
I work

134
00:16:35,941 --> 00:16:37,768
for a newspaper

135
00:16:43,933 --> 00:16:46,590
Professor Von Braun is
your father?

136
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:52,385
It's vital that I write about him;
Could you arrange a meeting?

137
00:16:53,158 --> 00:16:57,484
I don't know. I've never seen him.
I'll ask

138
00:16:58,986 --> 00:17:00,644
Finally, I leave you

139
00:17:00,817 --> 00:17:03,077
- Here?
- I've changed my mind

140
00:17:04,747 --> 00:17:06,438
You have the address?

141
00:17:08,543 --> 00:17:09,872
Yes. Tell him to stop

142
00:17:26,925 --> 00:17:28,549
Telecommunication

143
00:17:51,902 --> 00:17:54,025
I'd like to telecommunicate

144
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,891
- Galaxy or local call?
- Local

145
00:17:57,497 --> 00:17:58,689
Cabin 2

146
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,908
Miss, do you know that man?

147
00:18:49,248 --> 00:18:51,371
Of course I know him.
Don't be stupid

148
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:54,184
At the end of Galata Bridge

149
00:19:55,286 --> 00:19:58,113
one finds the Red Star.
My place

150
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:03,601
You can't compare it

151
00:20:03,944 --> 00:20:12,063
to our splendid
galactic corridors

152
00:20:13,535 --> 00:20:19,951
all a-glitter with
luxury and light

153
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:29,214
It's only a vast labyrinth,
tall, cramped

154
00:20:29,387 --> 00:20:31,010
Is this the Red Star Hotel?

155
00:20:31,185 --> 00:20:33,479
Yes, it is, thank you

156
00:20:36,147 --> 00:20:39,372
- Is Mr. Dickson in?
- He's out

157
00:20:39,544 --> 00:20:41,168
Fine, I'll wait

158
00:20:43,474 --> 00:20:45,132
You have money, sir?

159
00:20:48,735 --> 00:20:51,562
You can have a seat, sir,
if you're tired

160
00:20:57,327 --> 00:21:01,279
I wanted to see it again

161
00:21:01,757 --> 00:21:05,186
the tomb of
the Duc de Montpensier

162
00:21:12,913 --> 00:21:17,103
The reclining statue
of the Prince

163
00:21:17,475 --> 00:21:20,200
is the work of Pradier

164
00:21:21,338 --> 00:21:24,823
The Prince wears
the costume of

165
00:21:48,579 --> 00:21:50,134
Henry, it's me!

166
00:21:53,341 --> 00:21:55,567
We've got plenty to talk about

167
00:21:55,739 --> 00:21:59,133
- Where's my key?
- Where's my money, Mr. Dickson?

168
00:22:08,826 --> 00:22:10,620
- My key.
- His key

169
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:12,619
And a beer

170
00:22:18,517 --> 00:22:19,743
And me?

171
00:22:30,339 --> 00:22:33,860
Why don't you hurry up
and commit suicide?

172
00:22:34,036 --> 00:22:36,364
We need the room for our cousin
from the south

173
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:49,149
You come from the Outlands?

174
00:22:49,788 --> 00:22:52,717
Why did he ask
if you'd commit suicide?

175
00:22:53,918 --> 00:22:58,471
There's quite a few...

176
00:23:06,439 --> 00:23:10,629
There's quite a few who do

177
00:23:11,767 --> 00:23:15,457
One can't adapt to this place

178
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:22,818
It's the method
the Chinese invented

179
00:23:23,922 --> 00:23:28,248
about thirty years ago
in Pekingville

180
00:23:30,383 --> 00:23:33,777
Dissuasion is their strong point

181
00:23:34,046 --> 00:23:38,838
What about those who won't adapt,
or commit suicide?

182
00:23:39,341 --> 00:23:45,326
- Those... they're executed.
- Yes, the authorities

183
00:23:45,502 --> 00:23:48,727
But one can hide, you know.
There aren't many left

184
00:23:48,899 --> 00:23:51,454
Dick Tracy, is he dead?

185
00:23:52,762 --> 00:23:54,158
And Guy Leclair?

186
00:23:59,489 --> 00:24:02,782
Why didn't we hear from them,
or from you, Henry?

187
00:24:10,711 --> 00:24:14,435
I'm sorry.
These things happen

188
00:24:16,805 --> 00:24:18,736
And what's Alpha 60?

189
00:24:20,435 --> 00:24:26,555
A giant computer, like they used
to have in big business

190
00:24:27,363 --> 00:24:29,986
Nueva York... IBM...

191
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,247
Olivetti... General Electric...
Tokyorama...

192
00:24:33,657 --> 00:24:39,243
Alpha 60 is one hundred and fifty
light years more powerful

193
00:24:41,716 --> 00:24:46,440
I see. People have become slaves
of probabilities

194
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:50,535
Their ideal here, in Alphaville

195
00:24:50,707 --> 00:24:57,259
is a technocracy, like that
of termites and ants

196
00:24:57,867 --> 00:24:59,162
I don't understand

197
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:04,223
Probably one hundred and fifty
light years ago

198
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:08,087
One hundred and fifty,
two hundred

199
00:25:08,823 --> 00:25:12,150
there were artists
in the ant society

200
00:25:14,418 --> 00:25:19,176
Artists, novelists,
musicians, painters

201
00:25:21,578 --> 00:25:24,769
Today, no more

202
00:25:26,407 --> 00:25:28,268
Nothing. Like here

203
00:25:31,236 --> 00:25:34,528
Has Professor Von Braun
organized it all?

204
00:25:35,098 --> 00:25:39,151
He obeys logical orders

205
00:25:44,523 --> 00:25:46,510
Then why didn't you kill him?

206
00:25:47,188 --> 00:25:53,375
"Why"... what does that word mean?
I forgot...

207
00:26:02,273 --> 00:26:06,826
You know his daughter, Natasha?
Who is she really?

208
00:26:18,857 --> 00:26:21,649
It was him they sent
to Los Alamos

209
00:26:26,517 --> 00:26:29,911
His name wasn't that then

210
00:26:35,041 --> 00:26:37,562
Answer! That wasn't his name
in those days

211
00:26:45,532 --> 00:26:46,827
Listen, Henry

212
00:26:48,196 --> 00:26:53,055
We'll get out together; you'll
be OK. But first you must...

213
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,697
It's a terrible secret, but...

214
00:27:16,603 --> 00:27:19,725
Come in, Madame la Marquise

215
00:27:27,426 --> 00:27:30,514
My coat, Madame Recamier

216
00:27:32,055 --> 00:27:34,450
Thank you, Madame Pompadour

217
00:27:36,118 --> 00:27:39,547
Madame Bovary, Marie Antoinette

218
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:42,208
Madame Lafayette

219
00:28:10,452 --> 00:28:13,109
Madame, it's love

220
00:28:20,076 --> 00:28:22,767
I'll say it in Russian

221
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:46,115
So young and me

222
00:29:15,657 --> 00:29:19,745
Lemmy... conscience...

223
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:26,043
Alpha 60... make...
self destruct...

224
00:29:26,214 --> 00:29:27,871
Tenderness...

225
00:29:31,042 --> 00:29:34,028
Save those who weep

226
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,257
Yes, yes, that's it

227
00:30:05,543 --> 00:30:07,632
The Capital of Pain

228
00:30:09,573 --> 00:30:14,933
14, Light Radiation.
Institute of General Semantics

229
00:30:15,134 --> 00:30:16,121
You know where it is?

230
00:30:16,567 --> 00:30:21,188
You prefer I pass through
the North Zone or the South?

231
00:30:21,461 --> 00:30:23,255
What's the difference?

232
00:30:23,426 --> 00:30:25,288
There's snow in the North

233
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:27,650
and sun in the South

234
00:30:29,587 --> 00:30:32,709
Anyway, it's my journey
to the end of the night

235
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:35,047
So, it doesn't matter

236
00:30:41,277 --> 00:30:43,604
It was my first night
in Alphaville

237
00:30:43,973 --> 00:30:48,026
but it seemed to me that
centuries had passed

238
00:31:02,156 --> 00:31:03,711
I'm very well, thank you
so very much

239
00:32:02,099 --> 00:32:03,927
Miss Natasha Von Braun

240
00:32:04,064 --> 00:32:06,721
- Which section?
- Programming and memory

241
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:33,426
The Central Memory...

242
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:37,029
...is thus named...

243
00:32:38,199 --> 00:32:41,923
...because of
the primordial role...

244
00:32:42,395 --> 00:32:44,256
...that it plays...

245
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:50,587
...in the logic-organization
within Alpha 60

246
00:32:52,819 --> 00:32:56,611
But no one has lived
in the past...

247
00:32:57,981 --> 00:33:03,237
...and no one will live
in the future

248
00:33:04,574 --> 00:33:09,933
The present is the form
of all life

249
00:33:11,301 --> 00:33:13,662
This quality...

250
00:33:14,165 --> 00:33:18,616
...cannot be changed by any means

251
00:33:20,692 --> 00:33:24,746
Time is like a circle...

252
00:33:25,521 --> 00:33:27,984
...which turns endlessly

253
00:33:29,517 --> 00:33:34,706
The descending arc is the past

254
00:33:36,411 --> 00:33:39,737
The arc that climbs
is the future

255
00:33:42,305 --> 00:33:44,236
Everything has been said...

256
00:33:45,736 --> 00:33:50,720
...provided words do not change
their meanings...

257
00:33:52,162 --> 00:33:55,092
...and meanings their words

258
00:33:57,125 --> 00:34:01,746
Is it not obvious that someone...

259
00:34:03,152 --> 00:34:05,979
...who customarily lives...

260
00:34:07,282 --> 00:34:10,767
...in a state of suffering...

261
00:34:12,277 --> 00:34:17,795
...requires a different sort
of religion...

262
00:34:19,537 --> 00:34:26,486
...from a person habitually
in a state of well-being?

263
00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:32,152
Before us, nothing existed here

264
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:34,811
No one

265
00:34:36,688 --> 00:34:39,810
We are totally alone here

266
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:47,601
We are unique,
dreadfully unique

267
00:34:49,641 --> 00:34:53,071
The meaning of words...

268
00:34:53,837 --> 00:34:58,595
...and of expressions,
is no longer grasped

269
00:35:01,231 --> 00:35:07,317
An isolated word, or a detail
of a design...

270
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:11,113
...can be understood

271
00:35:12,187 --> 00:35:18,239
But the meaning
of the whole escapes

272
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:25,273
Once we know the number one...

273
00:35:25,741 --> 00:35:29,670
...we believe that we know
the number two...

274
00:35:30,737 --> 00:35:36,255
...because one plus one
equals two

275
00:35:38,495 --> 00:35:42,254
We forget that first...

276
00:35:42,459 --> 00:35:48,386
...we must know
the meaning of plus

277
00:35:48,553 --> 00:35:49,677
I'm going

278
00:35:50,218 --> 00:35:53,941
The acts of men...

279
00:35:55,546 --> 00:35:57,510
...carried over...

280
00:35:57,877 --> 00:35:59,932
...from past centuries...

281
00:36:00,641 --> 00:36:03,128
...will gradually...

282
00:36:03,972 --> 00:36:05,731
...destroy them...

283
00:36:06,736 --> 00:36:07,893
...logically...

284
00:36:10,066 --> 00:36:13,756
I, Alpha 60...

285
00:36:15,394 --> 00:36:21,412
...am merely the logical means
of this destruction

286
00:36:38,573 --> 00:36:39,969
Good night, Comrade

287
00:36:44,999 --> 00:36:46,691
I thought I'd never
see you again

288
00:36:49,662 --> 00:36:51,989
- Shall we go?
- I'll get the keys

289
00:36:56,788 --> 00:37:00,217
I left because I couldn't
understand a word he was saying

290
00:37:02,683 --> 00:37:04,374
But it's very simple

291
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:08,371
We learnt this evening

292
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,934
that death and life

293
00:37:11,607 --> 00:37:14,196
are found within
the same circle

294
00:37:21,998 --> 00:37:25,552
- Are you afraid of death?
- Of course not. Why?

295
00:37:28,525 --> 00:37:31,750
We took the tangent
to the center districts

296
00:37:33,354 --> 00:37:36,579
Traffic bulletins on the radio...

297
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:40,207
...as Natasha spoke to me
in her pretty sphinx voice

298
00:37:41,945 --> 00:37:43,739
Pretty sphinx...

299
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:54,756
Foreign ambassadors
usually attend

300
00:37:55,399 --> 00:37:58,590
or delegations
from the districts

301
00:37:59,596 --> 00:38:01,890
Why does everyone
look so sad, somber?

302
00:38:03,126 --> 00:38:05,022
You ask too many questions

303
00:38:06,223 --> 00:38:08,119
Because they lack electricity

304
00:38:12,783 --> 00:38:14,509
The essence...

305
00:38:15,181 --> 00:38:19,200
...of the so-called
capitalist world...

306
00:38:20,809 --> 00:38:24,067
...or the communist world...

307
00:38:25,171 --> 00:38:29,623
...is not an evil volition...

308
00:38:30,233 --> 00:38:36,887
...to subject their people
by the power of indoctrination...

309
00:38:38,393 --> 00:38:40,856
...or the power of finance...

310
00:38:41,856 --> 00:38:43,514
...but simply...

311
00:38:44,353 --> 00:38:46,510
...the natural ambition...

312
00:38:47,384 --> 00:38:49,405
...of any organization...

313
00:38:50,215 --> 00:38:53,666
...to plan all its actions

314
00:38:54,811 --> 00:38:57,433
In a word, to minimize
unknown quantities

315
00:38:57,674 --> 00:39:01,966
This dump of yours isn't
Alphaville, it's Zeroville

316
00:39:24,315 --> 00:39:27,403
- What are we going to see?
- I don't know, light and sound

317
00:39:40,101 --> 00:39:42,621
- Where is everyone?
- I believe; it's already begun

318
00:39:53,921 --> 00:39:55,385
Hurry. We're late

319
00:40:16,367 --> 00:40:17,559
It's already begun

320
00:40:59,459 --> 00:41:00,980
Don't they electrocute them
any more?

321
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:04,917
Darling, you know the provisions
of 17th Plan took a plunge

322
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,446
You see, I told you so

323
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:30,820
Stay here

324
00:41:35,026 --> 00:41:37,183
- Introduce me.
- I told you to stay there

325
00:41:38,589 --> 00:41:41,814
we're with very important people

326
00:41:42,452 --> 00:41:44,439
- Can I take a photo?
- I'll ask

327
00:41:50,411 --> 00:41:51,307
Yes

328
00:42:19,184 --> 00:42:21,739
- What have they done?
- They've been condemned

329
00:42:25,478 --> 00:42:26,772
Only men?

330
00:42:27,676 --> 00:42:31,502
There's usually a ratio of
fifty men executed to one woman

331
00:42:32,239 --> 00:42:33,703
But what have they done?

332
00:42:34,403 --> 00:42:36,491
They behaved illogically

333
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,690
Isn't that a crime
in the Outlands?

334
00:42:43,794 --> 00:42:48,518
Say, I know him.
He wept when his wife died

335
00:42:50,987 --> 00:42:52,645
He was condemned for that?

336
00:42:54,684 --> 00:42:55,944
Evidently

337
00:42:56,416 --> 00:42:57,710
We must advance to live

338
00:42:58,247 --> 00:43:01,176
Aim straight for those you love

339
00:43:40,374 --> 00:43:41,929
Listen to me, normals

340
00:43:42,338 --> 00:43:45,097
We see the truth
you no longer see

341
00:43:45,435 --> 00:43:49,387
The truth is that the essence
of man is love and faith

342
00:43:50,265 --> 00:43:54,250
courage, tenderness,
generosity and sacrifice

343
00:43:55,027 --> 00:43:57,854
The rest is the obstacle created

344
00:43:58,024 --> 00:44:00,113
by the progress
of your blind ignorance

345
00:44:05,583 --> 00:44:06,741
One day...

346
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:10,305
One day...

347
00:44:54,637 --> 00:44:58,429
Sorry, Professor,
but I must speak with you

348
00:44:59,266 --> 00:45:01,253
I never speak to journalists

349
00:45:02,563 --> 00:45:07,582
I'm not a journalist
Can't we talk somewhere quieter?

350
00:45:08,924 --> 00:45:12,546
- Goodbye, sir.
- Mr. Nosferatu

351
00:45:12,953 --> 00:45:14,611
That man no longer exists

352
00:45:43,491 --> 00:45:44,887
Are you crying?

353
00:45:46,288 --> 00:45:48,219
No, because it's forbidden

354
00:46:24,153 --> 00:46:26,309
Occupied

355
00:46:28,016 --> 00:46:29,640
Occupied

356
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:39,361
Free

357
00:46:42,736 --> 00:46:45,926
Sit there and answer when
you're spoken to

358
00:46:47,764 --> 00:46:49,319
I haven't done anything

359
00:46:50,128 --> 00:46:51,820
Newcomers must be interrogated

360
00:46:51,993 --> 00:46:54,321
Alpha 5

361
00:46:57,089 --> 00:46:59,314
What is your name?

362
00:47:06,713 --> 00:47:08,540
Where were you born?

363
00:47:09,977 --> 00:47:11,565
Nueva York

364
00:47:12,974 --> 00:47:14,995
How old are you?

365
00:47:16,403 --> 00:47:18,163
I don't know... 45

366
00:47:18,801 --> 00:47:22,423
What make is your car?

367
00:47:26,361 --> 00:47:29,619
What do you love above all?

368
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:32,453
Gold and women

369
00:47:34,153 --> 00:47:38,741
What are you doing in Alphaville?

370
00:47:39,748 --> 00:47:41,837
An article for Figaro-Pravda

371
00:47:42,712 --> 00:47:46,106
You seem afraid

372
00:47:47,674 --> 00:47:50,728
I'm not afraid...
not the way you think

373
00:47:51,470 --> 00:47:53,933
Anyway, you wouldn't understand

374
00:47:55,933 --> 00:48:00,089
Rest assured that my decisions...

375
00:48:00,528 --> 00:48:04,547
...always have in view...

376
00:48:05,623 --> 00:48:07,814
...the ultimate good

377
00:48:11,618 --> 00:48:13,411
I shall now...

378
00:48:14,082 --> 00:48:18,067
...ask you some test questions...

379
00:48:18,711 --> 00:48:20,902
...as a security measure

380
00:48:21,942 --> 00:48:23,565
No, go ahead

381
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:27,464
You have come from the Outlands

382
00:48:28,235 --> 00:48:30,699
What were your feelings...

383
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:36,192
...when you passed through
galactic space?

384
00:48:37,194 --> 00:48:40,021
The silence of infinite space

385
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:41,519
appalled me

386
00:48:44,487 --> 00:48:47,042
What is the privilege
of the dead?

387
00:48:49,516 --> 00:48:51,208
To die no more

388
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:57,707
Do you know what illuminates
the night?

389
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,104
Poetry

390
00:49:04,701 --> 00:49:06,756
What is your religion?

391
00:49:08,930 --> 00:49:12,381
I believe in the inspirations
of conscience

392
00:49:12,861 --> 00:49:17,255
Do you make any distinction...

393
00:49:18,155 --> 00:49:22,277
...between the mysterious
principles...

394
00:49:23,350 --> 00:49:25,939
...of knowledge...

395
00:49:26,514 --> 00:49:30,273
...and those of love?

396
00:49:31,109 --> 00:49:35,094
In my opinion, in love
there is no mystery

397
00:49:35,439 --> 00:49:39,061
You are not telling the truth

398
00:49:40,001 --> 00:49:41,091
I don't understand

399
00:49:42,199 --> 00:49:46,685
You are hiding certain things

400
00:49:47,993 --> 00:49:50,616
I admit I might have
reasons to lie

401
00:49:50,791 --> 00:49:54,844
but how can you differentiate
between lies and truth?

402
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:59,971
You are hiding certain things...

403
00:50:01,214 --> 00:50:07,368
...but I do not know yet
what they are

404
00:50:09,473 --> 00:50:15,661
For the time being, you are free

405
00:50:17,765 --> 00:50:22,557
I should like you to visit...

406
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:27,921
...the Control Complex

407
00:50:31,886 --> 00:50:33,611
Come with me, Mr. Johnson

408
00:50:46,471 --> 00:50:49,957
- Where are we going?
- To the Chief Engineer

409
00:51:25,235 --> 00:51:26,927
Ah, the day breaks

410
00:51:42,485 --> 00:51:44,074
Sit down, Mr. Johnson

411
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:50,171
A momentous occasion

412
00:51:50,744 --> 00:51:54,037
Yes, we spent three years looking
for Grand Omega Minus

413
00:52:01,834 --> 00:52:03,695
Well, Mr. Johnson...

414
00:52:07,063 --> 00:52:08,788
How do you find Alphaville?

415
00:52:09,493 --> 00:52:12,184
Not bad, if I knew where I was

416
00:52:12,856 --> 00:52:17,148
You are in the center of
Alphaville, inside Alpha 60

417
00:52:21,282 --> 00:52:26,108
The task of Alpha 60
is to calculate and project

418
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:31,404
the results which Alphaville
will subsequently enjoy

419
00:52:33,338 --> 00:52:34,427
Why?

420
00:52:35,269 --> 00:52:38,698
No one ever says "why";
one says "because"

421
00:52:40,797 --> 00:52:44,556
In the life of individuals,
as in the life of nations

422
00:52:44,726 --> 00:52:47,588
all is linked,
all is consequence

423
00:52:50,255 --> 00:52:54,013
That's the famous theory of
Professor Leonard Nosferatu

424
00:52:54,484 --> 00:52:57,448
Leonard Nosferatu no longer
exists, Mr. Johnson

425
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:03,939
The Outlands expelled him in 1964

426
00:53:05,174 --> 00:53:08,001
Today there is only
Professor Von Braun

427
00:53:08,804 --> 00:53:13,629
I remember. He was sent
to a village in the desert

428
00:53:13,966 --> 00:53:16,327
to perfect his invention

429
00:53:17,329 --> 00:53:19,293
He was exiled, you mean

430
00:53:19,927 --> 00:53:25,377
Now the Outlands wring their hands,
wishing him back

431
00:53:25,954 --> 00:53:31,575
They flood us with spies. Perhaps
you are a spy, Mr. Johnson

432
00:53:32,415 --> 00:53:35,605
You know I'm only a free man

433
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:44,094
A meaningless reply.
We know nothing

434
00:53:45,502 --> 00:53:50,089
We record, calculate,
draw conclusions

435
00:53:53,462 --> 00:53:56,947
An hour ago,
one of Alpha 60's

436
00:53:57,125 --> 00:54:00,610
1.4 billion nerve centres
questioned you

437
00:54:00,789 --> 00:54:04,478
Your replies were difficult and
sometimes impossible to codify

438
00:54:04,751 --> 00:54:07,805
We deduce an above-average
intelligence

439
00:54:08,481 --> 00:54:13,669
We are sometimes in mortal need
of superior intelligences

440
00:54:13,842 --> 00:54:16,771
At other times we have a no less
mortal distrust of them

441
00:54:18,705 --> 00:54:20,794
So what will you do with me?

442
00:54:21,435 --> 00:54:25,057
For the moment, we're ordered
to show you Alpha 60

443
00:54:25,232 --> 00:54:28,218
Who ordered you?
Professor Von Braun?

444
00:54:29,161 --> 00:54:30,955
Absolutely not

445
00:54:31,892 --> 00:54:34,287
An order is a logical conclusion

446
00:54:35,722 --> 00:54:39,945
One must not be afraid of logic.
Simply that. Period

447
00:54:42,649 --> 00:54:47,044
The circuit elements...
of 183 Omega Minus... malfunction

448
00:54:47,578 --> 00:54:50,064
Calculating or memory elements?

449
00:54:50,341 --> 00:54:52,305
Memory

450
00:54:54,172 --> 00:54:56,795
Professors Eckel and Jeckel

451
00:54:57,002 --> 00:54:58,523
I'm very well, thank you,
pleased to meet you

452
00:54:58,700 --> 00:54:59,063
Me too

453
00:55:02,630 --> 00:55:06,956
I'd like to know what
Grand Omega Minus is

454
00:55:07,259 --> 00:55:10,654
Our 17th electricity plan
is inadequate

455
00:55:11,754 --> 00:55:15,683
Sooner or later, the Outlands
will declare war on us

456
00:55:16,583 --> 00:55:19,103
Therefore, we decided
to invade them

457
00:55:19,281 --> 00:55:22,301
Directed by Professor Von Braun,
Omega Minus will be

458
00:55:22,478 --> 00:55:24,771
victorious over anti-matter

459
00:55:24,942 --> 00:55:26,406
I see, it's ideal

460
00:55:27,706 --> 00:55:30,170
We can perhaps use men like you

461
00:55:30,337 --> 00:55:33,630
to tell us the weak points
of the Outlands

462
00:55:36,198 --> 00:55:41,716
Your tendency to dwell
in the past...

463
00:55:42,892 --> 00:55:45,015
...could be useful to us

464
00:55:48,819 --> 00:55:53,406
We send those properly brain-washed
to provoke the other galaxies

465
00:55:53,582 --> 00:55:58,340
the strikes, revolutions,
family rows, student revolts

466
00:55:58,511 --> 00:56:00,736
That's us: Grand Omega Minus

467
00:56:00,942 --> 00:56:03,734
- Where now?
- The invisible part of Alpha 60

468
00:56:09,101 --> 00:56:13,359
You think more
of what has been...

469
00:56:14,495 --> 00:56:16,652
...than of what will be

470
00:56:22,122 --> 00:56:23,813
It's old, your camera

471
00:56:23,986 --> 00:56:25,450
The technical...
I don't believe in it

472
00:56:25,618 --> 00:56:26,912
Yes, of course

473
00:56:27,916 --> 00:56:32,810
Jeckel asked why I shot
the individual in my bathroom...

474
00:56:33,577 --> 00:56:36,541
...when the whole thing
was just a psycho-test

475
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:42,767
I replied, because I'm too old
to argue. So I shoot

476
00:56:43,834 --> 00:56:46,389
It's my only weapon
against fatality

477
00:56:51,627 --> 00:56:55,579
- What's this?
- Central Interrogation Station

478
00:56:55,856 --> 00:56:58,547
Here Alpha 60 sets itself problems

479
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:02,047
The forms and references used
by Alpha 60

480
00:57:02,217 --> 00:57:03,840
are too complex
for human understanding

481
00:57:04,448 --> 00:57:06,276
What sort of problems?

482
00:57:06,979 --> 00:57:09,704
Train and airplane departures...
movement of people and goods

483
00:57:09,877 --> 00:57:13,306
electricity distribution...
crime suppression... war operations

484
00:57:14,905 --> 00:57:21,264
Element Seven, Malfunction

485
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:53,898
What's happening?

486
00:57:55,467 --> 00:57:57,828
It's war with the Outlands

487
00:57:59,563 --> 00:58:01,857
A simple instruction...

488
00:58:03,059 --> 00:58:06,250
...is usually insufficient...

489
00:58:07,489 --> 00:58:09,578
...to put into...

490
00:58:09,753 --> 00:58:13,046
...execution...

491
00:58:14,249 --> 00:58:19,199
...a task set by Alpha 60

492
00:58:22,241 --> 00:58:24,296
Do not think...

493
00:58:24,473 --> 00:58:26,266
...that it is I...

494
00:58:26,438 --> 00:58:30,094
...who initiate
this destruction...

495
00:58:31,167 --> 00:58:35,061
...nor the scientists...

496
00:58:35,895 --> 00:58:39,416
...who have accepted my plan

497
00:58:41,123 --> 00:58:43,916
Ordinary men...

498
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:46,843
...are unworthy...

499
00:58:47,750 --> 00:58:50,872
...of the positions they hold...

500
00:58:51,214 --> 00:58:53,235
...in the world

501
00:58:53,978 --> 00:58:57,430
Analysis of their past...

502
00:58:57,608 --> 00:59:03,059
...automatically leads one...

503
00:59:04,069 --> 00:59:06,430
...to this conclusion

504
00:59:08,065 --> 00:59:10,052
Therefore...

505
00:59:10,629 --> 00:59:12,786
...they must be destroyed

506
00:59:14,293 --> 00:59:18,983
That is to say: transformed

507
00:59:22,119 --> 00:59:26,172
I don't need anyone
to draw it for me

508
00:59:27,913 --> 00:59:30,070
During these years,
under the direction...

509
00:59:30,211 --> 00:59:33,140
...of Von Braun
and his assistants...

510
00:59:33,308 --> 00:59:36,499
...Alphaville had developed
by leaps and bounds...

511
00:59:37,038 --> 00:59:41,659
...guided by electronic brains
that developed themselves...

512
00:59:41,833 --> 00:59:44,853
...by conceiving problems...

513
00:59:45,030 --> 00:59:49,015
...that the human imagination
couldn't grasp

514
00:59:49,792 --> 00:59:53,515
Foreigners were gradually
assimilated...

515
00:59:53,688 --> 00:59:57,639
...especially the Swedes,
Germans and Americans

516
00:59:58,451 --> 01:00:03,310
The others, the unassimilatables
were purely and simply killed

517
01:00:04,478 --> 01:00:07,135
I walked through the threaten
of executions

518
01:00:07,775 --> 01:00:11,465
Usually, we would seat them
in a room...

519
01:00:11,638 --> 01:00:17,066
...and electrocute them in their
chairs as they watched a show

520
01:00:17,533 --> 01:00:21,257
Then we'd dump them into
huge rubbish bins...

521
01:00:21,429 --> 01:00:24,188
...and the theater was ready
for the next batch

522
01:00:24,793 --> 01:00:28,222
If an individual showed hope
of reclamation...

523
01:00:28,722 --> 01:00:33,343
...he was sent to a chronic
illness hospital where...

524
01:00:33,518 --> 01:00:38,809
...mechanical and propagandistic
treatments soon cured him

525
01:00:40,212 --> 01:00:42,641
I felt that my existence here...

526
01:00:42,809 --> 01:00:47,203
...was becoming a distorted,
twilight memory...

527
01:00:47,405 --> 01:00:50,163
...and without a doubt,
a terrible destiny

528
01:00:51,035 --> 01:00:55,463
I was left only one solution

529
01:00:58,594 --> 01:01:01,114
It would not be logical...

530
01:01:01,990 --> 01:01:03,387
...to prevent...

531
01:01:04,155 --> 01:01:07,516
...superior beings...

532
01:01:09,083 --> 01:01:11,138
...from attacking...

533
01:01:11,315 --> 01:01:14,278
...the other galaxies

534
01:01:33,228 --> 01:01:34,692
344

535
01:01:39,256 --> 01:01:40,811
Put in one token

536
01:01:41,354 --> 01:01:42,613
Thank you

537
01:01:51,843 --> 01:01:52,933
Going up, sir?

538
01:01:53,908 --> 01:01:56,463
- No, I'll shine my shoes.
- Please, sir

539
01:02:20,983 --> 01:02:23,775
- This man has the key.
- This way, sir

540
01:02:49,556 --> 01:02:51,180
You're tired, sir?

541
01:02:54,617 --> 01:02:56,206
You'd like to sleep, sir?

542
01:02:58,613 --> 01:03:01,804
Yes, to sleep:
perchance to dream

543
01:03:05,175 --> 01:03:06,799
What are you exactly?

544
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:12,689
I'm a seductress, third class

545
01:03:16,663 --> 01:03:18,957
Has your colleague gone?

546
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:24,245
Who? Beatrice?

547
01:03:24,623 --> 01:03:27,814
I don't know;
a blonde with long legs

548
01:03:29,651 --> 01:03:32,171
She's working
in the peripheral flats

549
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:36,435
We're only replacements

550
01:03:38,209 --> 01:03:41,002
Ever heard of the Outlands?

551
01:03:45,103 --> 01:03:46,227
Never

552
01:03:51,964 --> 01:03:53,485
- Get out of here!
- Why?

553
01:03:56,459 --> 01:03:59,944
If anyone asks,
say you don't know

554
01:04:01,821 --> 01:04:03,876
I'm very well,
thank you so very much

555
01:04:26,964 --> 01:04:29,927
If it isn't the little princess

556
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:34,945
I was forbidden to come,
but I wanted to see you again

557
01:04:35,456 --> 01:04:36,478
Not me!

558
01:04:37,820 --> 01:04:40,148
Since you're here,
order breakfast for me

559
01:04:40,451 --> 01:04:41,938
Yes, sir

560
01:04:43,815 --> 01:04:46,835
Pardon, I'm very well,
thank you so very much

561
01:04:47,012 --> 01:04:48,340
Me too

562
01:04:53,639 --> 01:04:55,297
Bow your head

563
01:05:02,497 --> 01:05:03,859
What is it?

564
01:05:04,429 --> 01:05:06,790
Nothing. Just a thought

565
01:05:08,425 --> 01:05:10,117
What about my breakfast?

566
01:05:15,218 --> 01:05:17,114
I want to tele-order breakfast

567
01:05:17,283 --> 01:05:18,508
What is your number?

568
01:05:18,682 --> 01:05:20,044
You have a number?

569
01:05:20,447 --> 01:05:23,807
They didn't give me one
at Alpha 60

570
01:05:24,143 --> 01:05:27,231
Not your control number,
your room number

571
01:05:27,473 --> 01:05:28,937
344

572
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:36,855
Ever heard of this book?

573
01:05:38,729 --> 01:05:41,023
"The Capital of Pain"

574
01:05:43,625 --> 01:05:45,452
Some words are underlined

575
01:05:54,781 --> 01:05:58,141
We live in the void
of metamorphoses

576
01:06:00,010 --> 01:06:03,268
But the echo that runs
throughout the day...

577
01:06:04,539 --> 01:06:08,490
...that echo beyond time,
anguish or caress...

578
01:06:10,267 --> 01:06:13,627
Are we near to our conscience,
or far from it?

579
01:06:18,825 --> 01:06:21,016
These are words
I don't understand

580
01:06:24,053 --> 01:06:25,779
Conscience...

581
01:06:30,814 --> 01:06:34,038
And this:
death in conversation

582
01:06:39,639 --> 01:06:40,864
And this?

583
01:06:43,035 --> 01:06:47,395
Your eyes have returned
from a despotic land...

584
01:06:49,995 --> 01:06:53,254
...where no one has known
the meaning of a glance

585
01:06:54,858 --> 01:06:57,481
You've really no idea
what this is?

586
01:06:57,921 --> 01:06:59,647
It reminds me of something

587
01:07:02,117 --> 01:07:03,581
I don't know what

588
01:07:03,749 --> 01:07:05,270
Naked truth

589
01:07:05,447 --> 01:07:07,207
I know it well

590
01:07:07,379 --> 01:07:09,434
Despair has no wings,
nor does love

591
01:07:09,610 --> 01:07:11,541
No face, they don't speak

592
01:07:11,708 --> 01:07:13,638
I don't look at them,
I don't speak to them

593
01:07:13,773 --> 01:07:15,703
But I am as alive
as my love and despair...

594
01:07:16,571 --> 01:07:19,557
And this:
Dying is not dying

595
01:07:20,667 --> 01:07:23,687
And this:
The beguiler beguiler

596
01:07:24,463 --> 01:07:26,983
This:
Men who change

597
01:07:27,260 --> 01:07:30,780
Never heard of secret messages,
Miss Von Braun?

598
01:07:31,223 --> 01:07:32,915
A secret message?

599
01:07:33,621 --> 01:07:36,084
Don't you know what a secret is?

600
01:07:36,251 --> 01:07:41,111
Yes. Secrets of planning,
atomic secrets, secrets of memory

601
01:07:42,978 --> 01:07:46,135
Now what are you looking for?
This town is driving me nuts!

602
01:07:46,509 --> 01:07:49,199
I'm looking for a Bible,
to see if it's in it

603
01:07:50,305 --> 01:07:53,632
Are you a complete idiot? The word
I'm looking for, obviously...

604
01:07:54,901 --> 01:07:59,193
Where is it? There's always
one for every room

605
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:04,890
I'm becoming afraid

606
01:08:05,957 --> 01:08:09,647
Since you've come, I no longer
understand what is happening

607
01:08:12,418 --> 01:08:15,041
Me, I think I'm beginning
to understand

608
01:08:15,681 --> 01:08:16,906
Here it is

609
01:08:20,344 --> 01:08:24,704
"Conscience"... it's not in it

610
01:08:24,873 --> 01:08:26,235
I'm very well, thank you

611
01:08:36,028 --> 01:08:37,323
It's no longer there.

612
01:08:41,491 --> 01:08:43,784
So no one here

613
01:08:44,221 --> 01:08:49,149
knows the meaning of the word
conscience any more

614
01:08:51,481 --> 01:08:52,411
Too bad

615
01:08:54,611 --> 01:08:55,803
1 sugar or 2?

616
01:08:56,609 --> 01:08:57,767
2

617
01:09:06,167 --> 01:09:09,062
That's not a Bible,
it's a dictionary

618
01:09:12,228 --> 01:09:15,282
Isn't it the same
in the Outlands, Mr. Johnson?

619
01:09:15,524 --> 01:09:18,352
Answer me now, what's it for?

620
01:09:19,921 --> 01:09:25,939
Nearly every day words disappear,
because they are forbidden

621
01:09:28,046 --> 01:09:33,940
They are replaced by new words
expressing new ideas

622
01:09:36,539 --> 01:09:39,831
In the last two
or three months

623
01:09:40,368 --> 01:09:43,297
some words I was
very fond of disappeared

624
01:09:43,665 --> 01:09:46,594
Which words? I'm interested

625
01:09:47,661 --> 01:09:50,386
Redbreast, weeping

626
01:09:51,957 --> 01:09:53,545
autumn light

627
01:09:55,087 --> 01:09:57,052
tenderness too

628
01:10:01,415 --> 01:10:04,038
When I'm with you I'm afraid

629
01:10:06,942 --> 01:10:10,962
They ordered me
not to see you again

630
01:10:12,071 --> 01:10:15,727
Who? The Alpha 60 engineers?

631
01:10:22,229 --> 01:10:25,283
- Yes.
- What are you afraid of?

632
01:10:29,122 --> 01:10:32,574
I'm afraid because
I know that word

633
01:10:33,318 --> 01:10:36,077
without ever having seen it
or read it

634
01:10:36,948 --> 01:10:39,537
- Which word?
- Le conscience

635
01:10:40,645 --> 01:10:42,802
La conscience

636
01:10:48,371 --> 01:10:51,528
- You've never been to the Outlands?
- No

637
01:10:52,233 --> 01:10:53,425
Are you sure?

638
01:10:54,099 --> 01:10:55,189
Yes

639
01:10:56,163 --> 01:10:57,422
You're lying

640
01:10:59,426 --> 01:11:01,413
Why are you cross with me?

641
01:11:01,591 --> 01:11:03,851
I believe you mustn't say
"why" but "because"

642
01:11:05,288 --> 01:11:06,514
I said "why"?

643
01:11:08,019 --> 01:11:12,379
And if enemy ears are listening,
they heard you, too

644
01:11:16,810 --> 01:11:22,136
Well, then, I was careless,
because it's forbidden

645
01:11:25,202 --> 01:11:28,131
Perhaps it's all right for you
to use it

646
01:11:32,562 --> 01:11:34,049
When did I say "why"?

647
01:11:34,826 --> 01:11:37,948
Another question first:
where were you born?

648
01:11:39,122 --> 01:11:40,643
Here in Alphaville

649
01:11:41,954 --> 01:11:47,109
Another lie. Perhaps
you don't know, but you're lying

650
01:11:47,847 --> 01:11:50,969
I must know the truth:
where were you born?

651
01:11:53,609 --> 01:11:59,661
Here. I told you

652
01:12:02,201 --> 01:12:05,562
No, in Tokyorama

653
01:12:06,131 --> 01:12:08,821
the Land of the Rising Sun

654
01:12:09,494 --> 01:12:11,152
Go on, say it

655
01:12:12,691 --> 01:12:17,210
In Tokyorama,
in the Land of the Rising Sun

656
01:12:17,719 --> 01:12:21,204
Or in Florence,
perhaps... where

657
01:12:22,848 --> 01:12:25,676
try to remember it
for yourself, Natasha. Where?

658
01:12:25,845 --> 01:12:28,400
Where? I don't know

659
01:12:28,709 --> 01:12:31,831
Where the sky's as blue as
the South Seas

660
01:12:32,672 --> 01:12:37,793
Florence, where the sky's
as blue as the South Seas

661
01:12:38,866 --> 01:12:41,193
Or in Nueva York

662
01:12:46,425 --> 01:12:49,150
Where the winter... Broadway

663
01:12:49,323 --> 01:12:52,444
glitters in the snow
like a fur coat

664
01:12:53,119 --> 01:12:56,344
You see, you do know
the Outlands

665
01:12:56,749 --> 01:13:00,644
Your father was chased
from Nueva York in '64

666
01:13:01,345 --> 01:13:04,399
He brought you here, so you
are not from here

667
01:13:06,241 --> 01:13:08,534
I know what this book is

668
01:13:09,437 --> 01:13:14,297
A man who came with us from
Nueva York, he wrote these books

669
01:13:15,965 --> 01:13:17,861
I don't know what became of him

670
01:13:18,895 --> 01:13:23,221
They live in the forbidden
quarters here; they commit suicide

671
01:13:24,723 --> 01:13:28,980
I know that Alpha 60
uses them sometimes

672
01:13:29,419 --> 01:13:31,575
It controls them.
How come?

673
01:13:31,749 --> 01:13:34,508
Because they write
incomprehensible things

674
01:13:35,279 --> 01:13:40,207
Now I know:
it used to be called poetry

675
01:13:42,473 --> 01:13:46,368
It's believed to be secrets,
but really it's nothing

676
01:13:46,836 --> 01:13:55,057
When Control has an hour or so free
it codifies such stuff

677
01:13:56,094 --> 01:13:58,081
Like everything else,
one never knows

678
01:13:58,257 --> 01:14:00,245
It can always prove useful

679
01:14:00,422 --> 01:14:02,511
Absolutely.
We're highly organized

680
01:14:07,083 --> 01:14:10,103
I'd like to leave with you
for the Outlands

681
01:14:13,111 --> 01:14:14,507
But I'm afraid

682
01:14:15,908 --> 01:14:20,461
Now that I've seen you
I'm no longer normal

683
01:14:23,368 --> 01:14:25,229
When did I say "why"?

684
01:14:26,131 --> 01:14:27,221
Why?

685
01:14:30,827 --> 01:14:34,778
Because... you know very well,
Mr. Johnson

686
01:14:36,122 --> 01:14:37,586
No, I don't

687
01:14:38,952 --> 01:14:42,540
At which moment?
Tell me

688
01:14:42,716 --> 01:14:45,407
Quite often. Last night
in the corridor, for instance

689
01:14:45,579 --> 01:14:47,237
This time you're lying

690
01:14:49,976 --> 01:14:52,837
When I said I was
falling in love with you

691
01:14:53,006 --> 01:14:56,026
In love? What's that?

692
01:15:11,955 --> 01:15:12,920
This

693
01:15:14,552 --> 01:15:18,480
No, I know what that is:
it's sensuality

694
01:15:18,981 --> 01:15:22,808
No, sensuality is a consequence

695
01:15:23,643 --> 01:15:25,471
It cannot exist without love

696
01:15:26,375 --> 01:15:29,270
So what is love, then?

697
01:15:36,964 --> 01:15:39,860
Your voice, your eyes...

698
01:15:40,794 --> 01:15:43,417
...your hands, your lips...

699
01:15:46,955 --> 01:15:49,146
Our silences, our words...

700
01:15:51,883 --> 01:15:54,177
Light that goes...

701
01:15:55,047 --> 01:15:57,102
...light that returns

702
01:15:59,643 --> 01:16:02,630
A single smile between us

703
01:16:04,738 --> 01:16:09,064
In quest of knowledge,
I watched night create day...

704
01:16:10,267 --> 01:16:13,253
...while we seemed unchanged

705
01:16:13,797 --> 01:16:17,226
O beloved of all,
beloved of one alone...

706
01:16:18,125 --> 01:16:21,384
...your mouth silently promised
to be happy

707
01:16:23,753 --> 01:16:29,703
Away, away, says hate;
Closer, closer, says love

708
01:16:34,177 --> 01:16:37,662
A caress leads us from
our infancy

709
01:16:39,673 --> 01:16:42,794
Increasingly I see
the human form...

710
01:16:43,801 --> 01:16:46,288
...as a lovers' dialogue

711
01:16:46,465 --> 01:16:48,293
The heart has but one mouth

712
01:16:49,629 --> 01:16:51,525
Everything by chance

713
01:16:52,427 --> 01:16:55,151
All words without thought

714
01:16:56,256 --> 01:16:58,584
Sentiments adrift

715
01:16:59,420 --> 01:17:01,883
Men roam the city

716
01:17:03,117 --> 01:17:05,274
A glance, a word

717
01:17:06,546 --> 01:17:09,066
Because I love you

718
01:17:10,542 --> 01:17:12,166
Everything moves

719
01:17:14,672 --> 01:17:17,000
We must advance to live

720
01:17:19,035 --> 01:17:23,054
Aim straight ahead
toward those you love

721
01:17:25,695 --> 01:17:30,021
I went toward you,
endlessly toward the light

722
01:17:34,687 --> 01:17:38,207
If you smile, it enfolds me
all the better

723
01:17:41,747 --> 01:17:45,335
The rays of your arms
pierce the mist

724
01:17:46,542 --> 01:17:48,631
Capital of Sorrow

725
01:17:55,467 --> 01:17:58,692
I must know how the chief engineer
will use me

726
01:17:58,864 --> 01:18:01,328
As an inter-galaxy double agent,
I think

727
01:18:01,628 --> 01:18:05,455
- So it's true what Eckel said.
- What?

728
01:18:06,224 --> 01:18:10,312
You send spies to sabotage
the rest of the world

729
01:18:10,786 --> 01:18:13,579
Of course, you learn that
in school

730
01:18:19,811 --> 01:18:21,469
Are you going to betray me?

731
01:18:26,671 --> 01:18:30,657
You can't talk
or don't you want to

732
01:18:36,362 --> 01:18:39,450
Can I communicate with
the Outlands from this hotel?

733
01:18:39,625 --> 01:18:42,453
Just ask for Galaxy Service.
You want me to do it?

734
01:18:42,789 --> 01:18:44,946
The Outlands...

735
01:18:45,121 --> 01:18:47,243
I want to telecommunicate

736
01:18:47,418 --> 01:18:52,902
...telecommunications are
suspended for some days

737
01:18:53,945 --> 01:18:57,998
- What were you going to say?
- An atomic attack on Alphaville

738
01:18:58,641 --> 01:19:02,002
I'll explain later, Princess,
but now let's get out of here

739
01:19:02,171 --> 01:19:04,999
We must find the Professor...
where does he live?

740
01:19:09,930 --> 01:19:12,621
- Come with us!
- Where?

741
01:19:12,795 --> 01:19:14,782
- Residents Control.
- No kidding

742
01:19:15,092 --> 01:19:16,784
When he doubles up, get him

743
01:19:17,856 --> 01:19:20,819
Story 842, Miss

744
01:19:22,818 --> 01:19:26,303
One day a tiny man entered
a North Zone cafe

745
01:19:26,481 --> 01:19:30,274
and said, "I want a cup
of very hot, sweet coffee..."

746
01:19:31,210 --> 01:19:34,332
adding: "I shan't pay,
because I fear no one"

747
01:19:37,204 --> 01:19:38,862
He drank his coffee

748
01:19:43,265 --> 01:19:44,594
He left

749
01:19:46,862 --> 01:19:49,019
He drank his coffee
and didn't pay

750
01:19:49,227 --> 01:19:53,451
The cafe owner said nothing,
he was afraid of a scandal

751
01:19:54,654 --> 01:19:57,379
But when the tiny man repeated
the trick a few times

752
01:19:57,552 --> 01:20:00,606
the cafe owner said:
"I've had it, I'll get a tough guy

753
01:20:00,782 --> 01:20:03,473
to beat up this tiny man
if he comes back"

754
01:20:05,145 --> 01:20:07,836
So, on the fourth day

755
01:20:08,008 --> 01:20:13,300
when the tiny man said, "I want
a cup of very hot, sweet coffee..."

756
01:20:13,471 --> 01:20:16,026
the tough guy goes
to him and says:

757
01:20:16,601 --> 01:20:19,564
"So you're afraid of no one?"

758
01:20:20,098 --> 01:20:22,028
"That's right"

759
01:20:22,196 --> 01:20:24,057
"Well, neither am I"

760
01:20:24,526 --> 01:20:26,252
"Well", says the tiny man,
"Make that two cups of coffee

761
01:20:26,424 --> 01:20:28,684
very hot and sweet."

762
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:34,808
Meet you outside
Residents Control

763
01:20:35,017 --> 01:20:37,503
You'll stay here, Miss Von Braun

764
01:20:52,534 --> 01:20:56,257
Last night you lied

765
01:20:56,796 --> 01:21:00,589
You organized Dickson's death.
Why?

766
01:21:00,925 --> 01:21:05,149
Your name may be spelled...

767
01:21:05,321 --> 01:21:08,148
...lvan Johnson...

768
01:21:09,650 --> 01:21:14,238
...but it is pronounced
Lemmy Caution...

769
01:21:15,745 --> 01:21:17,709
...secret agent...

770
01:21:18,442 --> 01:21:24,131
...number zero zero three...

771
01:21:24,970 --> 01:21:27,160
...of the Outlands

772
01:21:29,465 --> 01:21:35,619
You are a menace
to the security of Alphaville

773
01:21:36,159 --> 01:21:38,714
I refuse to become
what you call normal

774
01:21:41,787 --> 01:21:45,546
Those you call mutants...

775
01:21:46,682 --> 01:21:51,111
...form a race superior...

776
01:21:51,944 --> 01:21:54,067
...to ordinary men...

777
01:21:54,508 --> 01:21:57,596
...whom we have almost eliminated

778
01:21:58,537 --> 01:22:00,058
Unthinkable

779
01:22:00,636 --> 01:22:02,691
An entire race cannot
be destroyed

780
01:22:03,133 --> 01:22:04,859
I shall calculate...

781
01:22:05,632 --> 01:22:07,925
...so that failure...

782
01:22:08,096 --> 01:22:10,083
...is impossible

783
01:22:11,425 --> 01:22:13,911
I shall fight so that failure
is possible

784
01:22:18,219 --> 01:22:22,511
Everything that I project
shall be accomplished

785
01:22:24,114 --> 01:22:27,134
Don't be so sure;
I have a secret, too

786
01:22:29,176 --> 01:22:35,228
What is your secret?
Tell me, Mr. Caution

787
01:22:38,034 --> 01:22:41,928
Something which never changes,
day or night

788
01:22:42,929 --> 01:22:47,619
The past represents its future,
it advances in a straight line

789
01:22:47,792 --> 01:22:51,118
yet it ends by coming
full circle

790
01:22:51,487 --> 01:22:54,315
I cannot trace it

791
01:22:54,485 --> 01:22:55,881
I won't tell you

792
01:22:56,050 --> 01:22:58,741
Several of my circuits...

793
01:22:58,914 --> 01:23:03,104
...are looking for the solution
to your riddle

794
01:23:04,542 --> 01:23:06,335
I will find it

795
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:11,198
If you find it, you will
destroy yourself simultaneously

796
01:23:11,936 --> 01:23:15,490
because you will become
my kin, my brother

797
01:23:16,331 --> 01:23:21,123
Those who are not born,
do not weep...

798
01:23:22,492 --> 01:23:24,752
...and do not regret

799
01:23:25,589 --> 01:23:31,483
Thus it is logical
to condemn you to death

800
01:23:32,882 --> 01:23:35,970
Fuck yourself with your logic

801
01:23:36,445 --> 01:23:39,771
My judgement is just...

802
01:23:41,008 --> 01:23:46,368
...and I am working for the
universal good

803
01:23:47,768 --> 01:23:52,355
If you plan to drive us from
the other galaxies, you'll fail

804
01:23:53,629 --> 01:23:59,284
You will not leave;
the exit is blocked

805
01:23:59,457 --> 01:24:00,547
We'll see

806
01:25:11,988 --> 01:25:14,349
Professor Von Braun - do you
know where he lives?

807
01:25:14,553 --> 01:25:22,774
Central Palace, South Zone,
behind Raw Materials Station

808
01:25:22,945 --> 01:25:24,307
Let's go

809
01:25:33,868 --> 01:25:34,923
Don't budge

810
01:25:38,797 --> 01:25:41,226
That way I'm sure you will
keep your word

811
01:26:46,799 --> 01:26:48,161
Out! Out!
No journalists!

812
01:26:48,431 --> 01:26:52,223
You know "journalist" and "justice"
both begin with the same letter?

813
01:26:52,394 --> 01:26:54,415
Tell your boss

814
01:27:18,768 --> 01:27:21,130
What can I do for you,
Mister Caution?

815
01:27:21,300 --> 01:27:23,956
News travels fast here

816
01:27:24,530 --> 01:27:27,460
Because we're very rapidly
entering Light Civilization

817
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:30,054
At about 300.000 kilometers
per second

818
01:27:31,823 --> 01:27:35,377
I'm returning to the Outlands.
Come with me

819
01:27:36,519 --> 01:27:38,846
Stay with us, Mister Caution

820
01:27:38,983 --> 01:27:43,468
When the war's over I'll put you
in charge of another galaxy

821
01:27:45,576 --> 01:27:48,199
You will have gold and women

822
01:27:59,298 --> 01:28:04,225
We are mastering a science
so fantastic

823
01:28:04,393 --> 01:28:08,151
that the old American and
Russian control of atomic force

824
01:28:08,322 --> 01:28:11,251
will seem pathetic

825
01:28:11,419 --> 01:28:12,406
I see

826
01:28:13,717 --> 01:28:17,940
You oppose my moral, even
supernatural, sense of vocation

827
01:28:18,113 --> 01:28:22,564
with a simple physical
and mental existence

828
01:28:22,742 --> 01:28:24,968
easily controllable
by technicians

829
01:28:38,660 --> 01:28:40,749
Your ideas are strange,
Mr. Caution

830
01:28:41,391 --> 01:28:43,446
Some years ago,
in the Age of Ideas

831
01:28:43,622 --> 01:28:46,313
yours would have been called
sublime ideas

832
01:28:58,141 --> 01:29:02,297
Look at yourself. Men of your type
will soon be extinct

833
01:29:03,104 --> 01:29:06,362
You'll become something
worse than dead

834
01:29:07,766 --> 01:29:10,127
You'll become a legend,
Mr. Caution

835
01:29:10,697 --> 01:29:12,752
Yes, I'm afraid of death

836
01:29:13,527 --> 01:29:19,148
but for a humble secret agent
that's a fact of life, like whisky

837
01:29:20,321 --> 01:29:22,047
And I've drunk that all my life

838
01:29:27,781 --> 01:29:32,300
You never want to see
the Outlands again, Professor?

839
01:29:32,576 --> 01:29:33,939
Goodbye, Mister Caution

840
01:29:37,837 --> 01:29:40,800
Such people will serve as
terrible examples to those...

841
01:29:40,968 --> 01:29:43,693
...who see the world
as theater...

842
01:29:43,865 --> 01:29:46,329
...when technical power
and its triumph...

843
01:29:46,496 --> 01:29:49,618
...is the only act
in their repertoire

844
01:30:13,538 --> 01:30:15,525
I was running a straight line...

845
01:30:15,701 --> 01:30:18,994
...which, like Dickson's
Greek labyrinth...

846
01:30:20,531 --> 01:30:25,481
...and philosophers were lost,
as a secret agent was too

847
01:30:42,277 --> 01:30:44,740
In many respects...

848
01:30:45,807 --> 01:30:50,757
...your reactions and your
modes of thought...

849
01:30:52,068 --> 01:30:53,691
...differ...

850
01:30:55,132 --> 01:30:58,652
...from present normality

851
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:02,417
The inhabitants of Alphaville
are not normal

852
01:31:03,290 --> 01:31:05,481
They are the product of mutation

853
01:31:06,954 --> 01:31:11,904
Do you accept our proposal?

854
01:31:13,314 --> 01:31:16,675
Answer silently...

855
01:31:17,643 --> 01:31:20,629
...with yes or no

856
01:31:22,005 --> 01:31:24,367
I'll never betray the Outlands

857
01:33:19,428 --> 01:33:21,948
The present is terrifying...

858
01:33:22,093 --> 01:33:27,782
...because it is irreversible,
and because it is of iron

859
01:33:29,618 --> 01:33:35,341
Time is the substance of which
I am made

860
01:34:05,851 --> 01:34:09,836
Time is a river
which carries me along

861
01:34:11,146 --> 01:34:13,043
But I am time

862
01:34:14,144 --> 01:34:18,935
It's a tiger, tearing me apart;
but I'm the tiger

863
01:34:19,239 --> 01:34:22,066
Look at her and me,
there's your answer

864
01:34:22,635 --> 01:34:24,826
We're happiness, and we're
heading towards it

865
01:34:26,165 --> 01:34:30,991
It is our misfortune
that the world is reality

866
01:34:31,793 --> 01:34:33,314
And I...

867
01:34:33,991 --> 01:34:39,214
...it is my misfortune
that I am myself, Alpha 60

868
01:34:57,435 --> 01:34:58,661
Natasha, quick...

869
01:35:05,295 --> 01:35:07,123
...think of the word love

870
01:35:14,653 --> 01:35:15,912
Here

871
01:36:24,986 --> 01:36:29,710
Not all the inhabitants died,
but all were stricken

872
01:36:30,781 --> 01:36:34,301
Those not asphyxiated
by the absence of light...

873
01:36:35,076 --> 01:36:38,903
...circled crazily, like ants

874
01:36:41,404 --> 01:36:44,629
It was 23.15, Oceanic Time...

875
01:36:44,802 --> 01:36:48,991
...when Natasha and I left
Alphaville by the peripheral roads

876
01:36:49,863 --> 01:36:54,620
A night drive across intersidereal
space, and we'd be home

877
01:36:56,557 --> 01:36:58,282
Don't look back

878
01:36:59,320 --> 01:37:02,307
- Do you think they're all dead?
- Not yet

879
01:37:04,183 --> 01:37:11,008
They may recover, and Alphaville
will be happy, like Florence

880
01:37:11,642 --> 01:37:14,901
Like Angouleme-city,
like Tokyorama

881
01:37:16,072 --> 01:37:18,036
You can't go back

882
01:37:22,565 --> 01:37:27,323
- Have I slept for long?
- No, the space of an instant

883
01:37:28,393 --> 01:37:31,220
Where are we?
In the Outlands?

884
01:37:32,523 --> 01:37:33,885
Not yet

885
01:37:36,619 --> 01:37:38,844
You're looking at me
with an odd face

886
01:37:43,846 --> 01:37:46,139
You're waiting for me
to say something

887
01:37:50,239 --> 01:37:51,863
I don't know what to say

888
01:37:53,503 --> 01:37:55,558
They're words I don't know

889
01:37:57,466 --> 01:37:59,555
I wasn't taught them

890
01:38:01,829 --> 01:38:03,157
Help me

891
01:38:04,326 --> 01:38:08,220
Impossible, Princess.
You must get there yourself

892
01:38:08,389 --> 01:38:11,080
Then you'll be saved.
If you don't

893
01:38:11,252 --> 01:38:13,807
you're as lost
as the dead of Alphaville

894
01:38:18,779 --> 01:38:20,038
I

895
01:38:23,042 --> 01:38:24,699
you

896
01:38:29,402 --> 01:38:30,957
love

897
01:38:32,999 --> 01:38:34,588
I love you
