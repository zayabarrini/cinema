It is a simple matter to understand,
Your Majesty.

507
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,475
The self-government of the small,
provincial towns of France must cease.

somebody is trying to seize control
of the entire country.

515
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:32,913

she must be free within herself.

to be involved,

Urbain Grandier,

1267
01:29:42,380 --> 01:29:45,577
you have been found guilty
of commerce with the Devil.

1268
01:29:45,660 --> 01:29:50,814
And that you used this unholy alliance
to possess, seduce and debauch

1269
01:29:50,900 --> 01:29:53,778
certain Sisters of the Holy Order
of St Ursula.

1270
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:59,893
You have also been found guilty of
obscenity, blasphemy and sacrilege.

1271
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:02,570
It is ordered that you proceed and kneel

1272
01:30:02,660 --> 01:30:05,049
at the doors of St Peter's
and Saint Ursula's

1273
01:30:05,140 --> 01:30:10,055
and there, with a rope round your neck
and a two-pound taper in your hand,

1274
01:30:10,140 --> 01:30:14,099
ask pardon of God, the King and justice.

1275
01:30:15,380 --> 01:30:18,452
Next, it is ordered that you be taken
to the marketplace,

1276
01:30:18,540 --> 01:30:21,179
tied to a stake and burned alive,

1277
01:30:21,860 --> 01:30:25,296
after which your ashes
will be scattered to the four winds.

1278
01:30:25,980 --> 01:30:28,653
It has been decided
that a commemorative plaque

1279
01:30:28,740 --> 01:30:31,618
shall be set up
in the Ursulines' chapel.

1280
01:30:31,700 --> 01:30:34,612
The cost of this, yet to be ascertained,

1281
01:30:34,700 --> 01:30:37,851
will be chargeable to your
confiscated estate.

1282
01:30:39,220 --> 01:30:45,011
Lastly, before sentence is carried out,
you will be subjected to the question,

My lords, I am innocent of the charges.

1288

And I am afraid.

that before this day ends,
