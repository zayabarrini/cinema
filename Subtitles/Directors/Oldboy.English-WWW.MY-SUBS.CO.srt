What?

5
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:54,160
I said

6
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,750
I want to tell you my story.

7
00:00:58,330 --> 00:00:59,580
What the hell?

8
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,420
Why are you talking like that?

9
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:06,800
Who the fuck are you?

10
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:16,270
My...

11
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,100
name is...

12
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:23,320
Oh...

13
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,360
..Dae-su.

14
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,450
Stop flirting with his girlfriend.

15
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,410
Hold on.

16
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:35,410
- Mr Oh Dae-su!
- Was I flirting with her? Was I?

17
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:39,750
OK! OK!

18
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:45,800
Sit down, Oh Dae-su.
You've had too much to drink.

19
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,180
I need to piss first.

20
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,980
I wasn't even flirting!
Motherfucker!

21
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,690
Arsehole!

22
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:02,560
Sit down!

23
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:05,320
I'm so sorry.

24
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:09,030
Fuck, I really need to piss.

25
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:12,030
- Isn't she cute?
- Very. Now sit down.

26
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,990
It's my daughter's birthday today.

27
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:18,290
I got her a birthday present.

28

<i>A little cloud</i>

<i>A pleasure boat</i>
<i>sailing on the river</i>

30
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,880
My name, Oh Dae-su, means...

31
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:34,510
.."getting through
one day at a time."

32
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,890
That's what "Oh Dae-su" means.

33
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,310
But...God...

34
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:43,520
Why can't I get through today?

35
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:45,110
Let me go!

36
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,950
<i>- Shut the fuck up!</i>
- Let me go!

37
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,970
Let go!
Get away from me!

38
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,840
Grab him!

39
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,800
He should be locked up.

40
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:26,980
I'll make sure he doesn't get drunk
and cause trouble again.

41
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,940
Have a nice day, Officer.

42
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,690
He's usually a nice guy.

43
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:32,950
Let's go.

44
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:35,410
I'll come back and see you soon.

45
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:38,030
Don't bother.

46
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:42,290
- That's up to me, arseholes.
- Hey!

47
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,880
Yeun-hee, it's Daddy...

48
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,920
Yeun-hee, it's Daddy...

49
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:51,880
Daddy's got a present
for my little Yeun-hee.

50
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:55,550
I'll be home soon with your present,
just wait a bit longer...

51
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,050
Let me talk to her.

52
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:00,010
- Good girl.
- Give me the phone.

53
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,730
Yeun-hee,
Joo-hwan wants a word with you.

54
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:05,980
You remember Joo-hwan, don't you?
Hold on.

55
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:09,150
Hello, Yeun-hee.

56
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,980
It's me, Joo-hwan.

57
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:16,030
So it's your birthday today?

58
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,070
Happy birthday!

59
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,950
I'll buy you
a nice treat tomorrow.

60
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,870
Hello? Oh, hello, Ja-hyun.

61
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,750
I'm sorry. I know it's very late.

62
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,880
Dae-su is on his way home.
I'm sorry. Yes?

63
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,380
Hold on.
Dae-su, it's your wife.

64
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,470
Dae-su!

65
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:41,390
Dae-su!

66
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,450
Your wife says you should hurry home!

67
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,620
Dae-su, let's get going!
Stop messing around!

68
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,850
Sir, sir.

69
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,810
Wait, come here.
Come and talk to me.

70
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:16,690
I won't ask you to let me go again.

71
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:21,070
Just tell me why I'm here, please.

72
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,490
I have a right to know why.

73
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:26,790
God, I've already been locked in here
for two months.

74
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,870
Sir, wait, come here.

75
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:34,000
Sir, wait. What is this place?

76
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:38,460
Please sir, just tell me how long
I have to stay here.

77
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,470
Sir!

78
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,050
Fuck you!

79
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,930
Come here, you arsehole!

80
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,930
Son of a bitch.

81
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:53,060
I saw your face, arsehole.
You're dead if I get out.

82
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:56,570
I'm sorry!
I won't swear at you again.

83
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:59,860
Just tell me how much longer.
One month? Two? Three?

84
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,160
Don't go!

85
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,410
I'm sorry.

86
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:07,330
Just tell me how long,
you son of a bitch!

87
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:11,710
I said tell me how long,
you arsehole!

88
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:15,170
Son of a bitch!

89
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,500
You fucking arseholes!

90
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,470
<i>If they had told me then</i>
<i>that it would be 15 years...</i>

91
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,930
<i>..would it have been</i>
<i>easier to endure?</i>

92
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:31,520
<i>Or harder?</i>

93
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,940
LAUGH,
AND THE WORLD LAUGHS WITH YOU.

94
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,770
WEEP, AND YOU WEEP ALONE.

95
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:45,990
<i>When the music begins,</i>
<i>gas is released.</i>

96
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:58,790
<i>When the gas is released,</i>
<i>I fall asleep.</i>

97
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,890
<i>Later on, I found out</i>

98
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,970
<i>that it was the same valium gas</i>
<i>that Russian soldiers used</i>

<i>I don't really like the style.</i>

102
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:32,240
<i>But they change my clothes</i>
<i>and clean the room.</i>

103
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,160
<i>Generous bastards.</i>

104
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:39,500
<i>One!</i>

105
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:41,880

<i>It's too spicy.</i>

108
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:52,970
I don't want spinach. You eat it.
I won't eat spinach.

<i>with stab wounds to the neck.</i>

110
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,570
<i>This was a cold-blooded murder.</i>

111
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:06,530
<i>As nothing of value was taken,</i>

112
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,740
<i>police suspect a personal motive.</i>

113
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:11,200
<i>The victim's husband, Oh Dae-su,</i>

114

<i>disappeared a year ago</i>

115
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:16,540
<i>Witnesses say</i>
<i>Oh Dae-su was a heavy drinker,</i>

<i>who fought constantly with his wife.</i>

117

<i>Neighbours also frequently argued</i>
<i>with Oh Dae-su.</i>

<i>Blood samples found at the scene</i>
<i>match those of Oh Dae-su.</i>

119

<i>Oh Dae-su's fingerprints have been</i>
<i>matched to those found on a cup.</i>

120
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:38,230
<i>Sources claim that Oh Dae-su</i>
<i>definitely visited his wife recently.</i>

121
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,270
<i>The only missing item</i>

122
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,530
<i>was a family album,</i>
<i>which backs the police theories.</i>

123
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,270
<i>After three years,</i>

<i>many wrinkles form on a man's face.</i>

125
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:39,910
<i>If you stand</i>
<i>outside a phone box on a rainy day...</i>

<i>my advice is</i>

128
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:49,300
<i>that you make friends</i>
<i>with television.</i>

129
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:53,090
<i>The television</i>
<i>is both clock and calendar.</i>

130
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:57,520
<i>It is your school, home, church,</i>

131

<i>..my lover's song...</i>

<i>Today at 7.:50am</i>
<i>the middle of Seoul's Sangsu Bridge,</i>

138
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,980
<i>50 metres in length,</i>
<i>suddenly collapsed...</i>

139
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:50,190
<i>I wrote a list</i>

140
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:54,030
<i>of all the people I had offended,</i>
<i>quarrelled with and hurt.</i>

141
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:00,370
<i>This was both my prison journal</i>

142
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,410
<i>and the autobiography</i>
<i>of my evil deeds.</i>

143
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,790
<i>I thought I had lived</i>
<i>a normal life...</i>

144
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,680
<i>..but there was too much wrong-doing.</i>

145
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:24,770
<i>All I could think at that moment</i>

146
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,060
<i>was that the man in the next room</i>

147
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:30,400
<i>probably only had one chopstick.</i>

148

<i>But...</i>

149
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:36,820
<i>But...</i>

150
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,250
<i>Who had imprisoned me?</i>

151

<i>Was it Yoo Heung-sam?</i>

<i>Lee So-young or Kang Chang-suk?</i>

<i>Whoever it was, wait.</i>

154
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,010
<i>Just you wait.</i>

155
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:02,600
<i>I'll rip your body limb from limb,</i>

156

<i>and your remains will never be found.</i>

157
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:10,190
<i>Because I will swallow</i>
<i>every last bit.</i>

158
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,130
<i>One line for each year.</i>

<i>So next year will be easier.</i>

161
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:50,190
<i>The more tattoos I have,</i>
<i>the shorter the chopstick becomes.</i>

162
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,650
<i>The shorter the chopstick becomes,</i>

163
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,940
<i>the bigger the hole in the wall</i>
<i>becomes.</i>

164
00:13:58,490 --> 00:13:59,780
<i>Anyway...</i>

165
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:03,080
<i>..time passes well.</i>

166
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,870
<i>Nine years.</i>

167
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,300
<i>10 years.</i>

<i>14 years.</i>

<i>I'll be out in a month.</i>

<i>I'll be out in one month.</i>

<i>I'll be out.</i>
<i>I'll be out in one month's time.</i>

183
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,980
<i>I'll be out of here.</i>

184
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:59,150
<i>I'll be out in a month.</i>
<i>In exactly one month.</i>

185
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:03,990
<i>I'll need money when I get out,</i>
<i>so what should I do?</i>

186
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:06,780
<i>Should I steal or rob?</i>

187
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:11,000
<i>What shall I eat first?</i>
<i>Kimchee soup? Barbecued eel?</i>

188
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,500
<i>Anything but fried dumplings.</i>

189
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,170
<i>But where am I?</i>

190
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:18,750
<i>With all the car horns,</i>
<i>it must be the city.</i>

191
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,840
<i>The most important thing</i>
<i>is what floor I'm on.</i>

192
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:26,140
<i>What if I break through the wall</i>
<i>and I'm on the 52nd floor?</i>

193
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:30,220
<i>Even if I plunge to my death,</i>
<i>I'll still be getting out.</i>

194
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:35,480
<i>I'm getting out.</i>
<i>In one month, I'm getting out.</i>

195
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,670
Picture yourself

196
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:08,300
lying in a field.

197
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,260
When you hear the bell...

198
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:15,680
..you will turn your head...

199
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:18,690
..and look down.

200
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,650
You will see

201
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,700
an endless field of green grass.

202
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,200
The sun is shining brightly...

203
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,410
..there's a cool breeze.

204
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,350
<i>It's a human being.</i>

205
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,310
Don't stop me!

206
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:21,100
Mister!

207
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,900
Even though...

208
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:28,440
..I'm no better than a beast...

209
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:35,070
..don't I have the right to live?

210
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,000
Mister.

211
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,290
Even though...

212
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:46,670
..I'm no better...

213
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,260
..than a beast...

214
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,890
..don't I have the right...

215
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:01,020
..to live?

216
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:03,440
Yes.

217
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,520
Yes.

218
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,500
<i>The alley with the phone box</i>
<i>was just here.</i>

219
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:31,550
<i>Now there's a block of flats.</i>

220
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,840
<i>So he releases me onto the roof.</i>
<i>What a fool.</i>

221
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:40,640
I want to tell you my story.

222
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,600
Die later.

223
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,350
What?

224
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,490
What the hell?

225
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:01,120
I see.

226
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:05,960
Now I'll tell you my story.

227
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,130
The reason...

228
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:13,510
..I want to die is...

229
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:18,590
Hey!

230
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:25,060
<i>That's a female human being.</i>

231
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,630
<i>Laugh,</i>

232
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,510
<i>and the world laughs with you.</i>

233
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,220
<i>Weep,</i>

234
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:03,010
<i>and you weep alone.</i>

235
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,600
<i>My home is gone.</i>

236
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:12,940
<i>I cannot call</i>
<i>my friends or relatives.</i>

237
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:16,900
<i>Because they say</i>
<i>I murdered my wife.</i>

238
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,620
<i>I am a fugitive.</i>

239
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,060
You dickshit!

240
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:02,240
<i>Dickshit...</i>

241
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,030
<i>A new word.</i>

242
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,830
<i>Television doesn't teach you</i>
<i>swear words.</i>

243
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:23,640
<i>Can 15 years' worth of</i>
<i>imaginary training be put to use?</i>

244
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,360
<i>Apparently, it can.</i>

245
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:40,190
<i>Rock Bream.</i>

246
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:43,240
<i>Oplegnathus fasciatus.</i>

247
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:46,700
<i>Lives in the warm waters</i>
<i>of coastal reefs.</i>

248
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,580
<i>This fish has weak reflexes,</i>

249
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:53,250
<i>but can resist powerfully</i>
<i>when caught in a hook.</i>

250
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:56,710
<i>In the Kyungsang Province,</i>
<i>its offspring...</i>

251
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:59,630
<i>What is that smell?</i>

252
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:14,980
Don't bother
asking me any questions.

253
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:17,520
I don't know anything.

254
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,250
Yes?

255
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:43,380
I said... I want to eat...
a living thing.

256
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:49,890
Oh... right.

257
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:51,470
Long time no see.

258
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:54,440
<i>This is my first time here.</i>

259
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,810
Maybe I'm wrong.

260
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,980
<i>But she looks familiar.</i>

261
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:04,030
You look very familiar.
Have we met before?

262
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:07,360
"Search for the Best Chef."

263
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:09,990
"Thursdays at 6:30 on MBC."

264
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:13,040
"The youngest female chef
of Japanese cuisine."

265
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,250
Oh, that?

266
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:18,750
They said the ratings are low,
but someone must watch it.

267
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:22,510
Women's hands are usually warm,
so they cannot make sushi.

268
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:25,220
Well, you certainly know your stuff.

269
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,690
Who are you?

270
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,030
<i>Do you</i>

271
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:46,450
<i>like your clothes?</i>

272
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,450
Why?

273
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:59,830
- Why did you imprison me?
<i>- Who do you think I am?</i>

274
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:04,130
- Yoo Heung-sam?
<i>- Wrong.</i>

275
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:08,010
- Did Lee So-young pay you?
<i>- Wrong again.</i>

276
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,760
Lee Jong-yong?

277
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:11,890
Kang Chang-suk?

278
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:15,100
Hwang Joo-yeun? Kim Na-sung?

279
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:19,190
Park Jin-woo? Im Duk-yoon?
Lee Jae-pyung? Kuk Su-ran?

280
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,110
- Who the hell are you?
<i>- Me?</i>

281
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:24,230
<i>I'm a sort of scholar.</i>

282
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:26,860
<i>And my field of study is you.</i>

283
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:30,160
<i>A scholar studying Oh Dae-su.</i>

284
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,580
<i>An expert on Oh Dae-su.</i>

285
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:36,370
<i>Who I am isn't important.</i>
<i>What's important is "why".</i>

286
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:38,040
<i>Think hard.</i>

287
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:40,170
<i>Study your whole lifetime.</i>

288
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:44,800
<i>School has finished,</i>
<i>now it's time for your homework.</i>

289
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,220
<i>Keep this in mind.:</i>

290
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,760
<i>"Whether it be a grain of sand</i>
<i>or a rock,</i>

291
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:54,390
<i>in water they both sink alike. "

292
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,100
Let me ask you one thing.

293
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:02,060
You hypnotised me in there,
didn't you?

294
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,820
What did you do to me?

295
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:07,570
<i>I miss you.</i>

296
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:09,530
<i>Come quickly.</i>

297
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:23,210
Here you are.

298
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,960
It's alive, OK?

299
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,050
I'll go and slice it up for you.

300
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:11,880
I must be a different breed of woman.
My hands are very cold.

301
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:15,090
<i>What is she doing?</i>

302
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:21,310
Sir.

303
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,650
Sir, wake up.

304
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,230
<i>Keep this in mind.</i>

305
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:33,030
<i>"Whether it be a grain of sand</i>
<i>or a rock...</i>

306
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:37,620
<i>..in water they both sink alike. "

307
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:45,670
Are you awake?

308
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,640
Is all this true?

309
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,910
That fever remedy works well.

310
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:26,370
Why did you faint if you've done
so much physical training?

311
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:34,010
A lack of vital sunlight leaves one
depleted of vitamins A and E.

312
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:39,010
Thus, one's immunity to influenza
is weakened.

313
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:43,310
Do you always talk like that?

314
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:59,320
The lock on the bathroom door
is broken.

315
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:00,990
Don't get any bright ideas

316
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,080
or I'll gut you like a fish.

317
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,540
What's this?

318
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:11,750
Suppositories. You fainted, so
how else could I give you medicine?

319
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:31,270
<i>Can 15 years' worth of</i>
<i>imaginary training be put to use?</i>

320
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,490
<i>Apparently not.</i>

321
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:58,590
That was an unforgivable sin.

322
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:07,100
I brought you back here
and then turned you down.

323
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:09,520
I can see why you're angry.

324
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:11,940
I really can.

325
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:19,530
You know, I brought you here
because I like you.

326
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:21,610
But...

327
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:26,450
You don't even know my name yet.

328
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,660
It's Mido.

329
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:31,460
You see...

330
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,290
..later on...

331
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,710
..when I'm really ready...

332
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:41,840
..I swear on my life
that I'll go through with it.

333
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:47,060
That song in your diary, <i>The Face</i>
<i>I Want to See</i> , that will be the sign.

334
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:49,520
When I sing it,

335
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,690
get ready.

336
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:58,860
I may try to resist you again

337
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:01,240
in the heat of the moment.

338
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,700
But no matter what, don't stop.

339
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:07,700
Just give it to me!

340
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:11,500
Give it...

341
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:14,880
..to me.

342
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:22,260
The ants...

343
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:24,800
Do you still see them?

344
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:27,640
Do you still feel that way?

345
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:32,770
Yeah, if you're alone, you see ants.

346
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:39,070
People I have met who are very lonely
have all hallucinated about ants.

347
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:42,700
I tried once to work out why.

348
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:45,820
Ants move around in groups,
you know.

349
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:50,830
So I suppose very lonely people
keep thinking of ants.

350
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:54,750
Although I have never done that.

351
00:33:57,650 --> 00:34:00,690
<i>She called from overseas</i>
<i>five or six years ago,</i>

352
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,650
<i>asking if her dad had come back.</i>

353
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,360
<i>She doesn't even know</i>
<i>that he killed her mother.</i>

354
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:11,370
She has hardly any relatives,
so she calls us.

355
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:15,160
Her Korean has got worse.

356
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,920
I think her Swedish foster parents
are both doctors.

357
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:24,800
You journalists must know...

358
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:29,590
Dae-su...

359
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,260
Is he really still on the run?

360
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:39,440
Your daughter's address
is on the front

361
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,190
and on the back is a map of
your wife's grave.

362
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,190
<i>Eva...</i>

363
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,410
<i>Stockholm...</i>

364
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,120
<i>Eva...</i>

365
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,160
Do you want to call her?

366
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,960
Shall I call her?

367
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:11,050
Shall we visit the grave tomorrow?

368
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:21,650
<i>No, first I have to kill</i>
<i>that bastard.</i>

369
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:50,300
BLUE DRAGON

370
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:54,010
Well?

371
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:56,260
<i>I haven't tasted it yet.</i>

372
00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:00,100
BLUE DRAGON

373
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,600
So?

374
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,900
Did it taste the same?

375
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:23,120
<i>I could taste food from</i>
<i>100 restaurants...</i>

376
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,500
<i>..but I will never forget</i>
<i>the food I tasted for 15 years.</i>

377
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,140
BLUE DRAGON

378
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:59,370
Shall I create an ID for you,
so you can log in?

379
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,580
Do you have
a favourite film or song?

380
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:08,380
I've already been talking...

381
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:11,210
..to him...

382
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,930
"The Count of Monte Cristo"?

383
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:27,440
There's no one by that name here.

384
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:39,490
HOW'S LIFE IN A BIGGER PRISON,
OH DAE-SU?

385
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:40,870
Who are you?

386
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:47,170
Who are you?

387
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:50,420
THE LONELY PRINCE IN THE HIGH
TOWER.

388
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:51,630
Who is he?

389
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:00,300
I don't know who he is.
I just chat to him sometimes.

390
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:02,640
We talk about sushi.

391
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,150
Where are you going?

392
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,330
Where are you going?

393
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:25,200
You are not to be trusted.

394
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:43,930
- VIOL...
- BLUE DRAGON

395
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:49,020
<i>Violet Blue Dragon...</i>
<i>What does that mean?</i>

396
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:04,200
<i>Why did they order</i>
<i>from a place so far away?</i>

397
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:08,330
<i>I've already passed</i>
<i>five Chinese restaurants.</i>

398
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,710
<i>I think my lungs are</i>
<i>on the verge of exploding.</i>

399
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:22,680
You there, tell your cooks

400
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:25,140
to put less scallions
in the dumplings.

401
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,640
OK.

402
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,650
- Leave it there and go.
- Yes, sir.

403
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:22,280
We don't take on anyone
who uses bodyguards.

404
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:24,570
Some companies specialise in that.

405
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:26,990
You should go to them.

406
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:30,700
We just take the small fry.

407
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:35,710
If the stay is over six months,
transportation is free.

408
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:38,460
Yes, of course.

409
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:46,760
Why did you imprison me, you...

410
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:51,180
..dickshit.

411
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:55,600
In our business on floor 7½

412
00:40:56,810 --> 00:40:59,610
client confidentiality
is our livelihood.

413
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,710
I am going to avenge myself
for all 15 years.

414
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:25,130
Each tooth I extract
will age you by one year.

415
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,530
Keep still.

416
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:51,620
Do you want to talk?

417
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:15,480
I don't know...

418
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:18,350
I didn't see his face...

419
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:21,230
I made recordings...

420
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,660
OH DAE-SU

421
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:45,340
All those who are blood-type AB,
raise your hand.

422
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,980
Go. Shoo!
He has lost a lot of blood.

423
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,280
Piece of shit.

424
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,000
Is he dead?

425
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:33,150
<i>I can't seem to</i>

426
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:36,150
<i>get through today either.</i>

427
00:46:37,910 --> 00:46:41,580
<i>Now I have become a monster.</i>

428
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:45,080
<i>When my vengeance is over...</i>

429
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:48,210
<i>..can I return to Oh Dae-su?</i>

430
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,010
Mister, are you alright?

431
00:46:57,170 --> 00:47:00,050
Look at all this blood.

432
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:03,260
What happened to you?

433
00:47:08,770 --> 00:47:12,020
Saewoon Apartments, Eung-am,
building 8. Take care of him.

434
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,480
Thank you.

435
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:16,690
Not at all.

436
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:19,610
Well, then...

437
00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:22,200
Farewell, Oh Dae-su.

438
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:27,250
<i>Farewell...</i>

439
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,620
<i>..Oh Dae-su.</i>

440
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:32,790
<i>Farewell.</i>

441
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:35,960
<i>Farewell.</i>

442
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:35,110
<i>The bastard you hate,</i>
<i>but don't dare kill.</i>

443
00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:38,400
<i>The bitch you detest,</i>
<i>who deserves a fate worse than death.</i>

444
00:48:38,570 --> 00:48:40,150
<i>We are at your service.</i>

445
00:48:41,450 --> 00:48:44,450
<i>Won't he go crazy</i>
<i>if he's locked up for a long time?</i>

446
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:49,660
<i>Well, if you don't want that,</i>
<i>we can drug his drinks.</i>

447
00:48:49,830 --> 00:48:52,830
<i>There's a thing</i>
<i>called 'Risterdal solution'.</i>

448
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,500
<i>It's a reliable drug</i>
<i>used to treat schizophrenia.</i>

449
00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:00,630
<i>But it depends on the length</i>
<i>of the treatment,</i>

450
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,430
<i>so how long will he...</i>

451
00:49:03,590 --> 00:49:04,640
<i>15 years.</i>

452
00:49:06,850 --> 00:49:08,180
<i>Is that possible?</i>

453
00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:10,270
<i>What did he do?</i>

454
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:12,560
<i>Oh Dae-su, you see...</i>

455
00:49:13,890 --> 00:49:15,940
<i>..talks too much.</i>

456
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:19,360
Go to sleep.

461
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:55,390
<i>..talks too much.</i>

462
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:01,980
Have you heard this voice before?

463
00:50:03,030 --> 00:50:05,200
Who loathes me this much?

464
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:15,040
Those 260 women you've had...

465
00:50:15,210 --> 00:50:19,290

Like a gazelle
from the hand of the hunter...

482
00:51:31,530 --> 00:51:34,620
Like a bird
from the snare of the fowler...

483
00:51:35,830 --> 00:51:37,290
Free yourself.

484
00:51:41,210 --> 00:51:42,630
Close quote.

485
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:46,130
Who are you? You bastard!

486
00:51:47,550 --> 00:51:49,680
<i>I decided when I was a prisoner</i>

487
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:52,180
<i>that if I got out,</i>
<i>I would trust no one.</i>

488
00:51:52,850 --> 00:51:55,220
<i>If I met anyone suspicious,</i>

489
00:51:55,390 --> 00:51:58,100
<i>I would invent a secret,</i>
<i>only known to the two of us.</i>

490
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:02,770
That ID, Monster, is a trap
I designed to catch him.

491
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:06,440
You let a stranger into your home.
Who are you?

492
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:18,290
Who's Evergreen?

493
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:30,300
<i>I tracked down that Evergreen ID</i>
<i>and found the owner's details.</i>

494
00:52:30,470 --> 00:52:32,840
- <i>Are you ready to jot it down?</i>
- Go ahead.

495
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:36,260
<i>It's Su Dae-oh.</i>
<i>Does the surname 'Su'even exist?</i>

496
00:52:36,430 --> 00:52:40,060
- Address?
- <i>Saewoon Apartments in Eung-am.</i>

497
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:41,730
<i>Building 7, flat 407.</i>

498
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:48,780
<i>Actually, life in a bigger prison</i>

499
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:51,240
<i>does not suit me very well.</i>

500
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:11,260
Evergreen.

501
00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:14,340
Who are you?

502
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:20,770
Is that what you wanted to ask?

503
00:53:22,390 --> 00:53:25,350
No. You must find that out
for yourself.

504
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:26,900
Come on, it's a game.

505
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:30,860
First " who?"
Then "why?"

506
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:34,160
When you know the answer,
come and see me.

507
00:53:34,530 --> 00:53:36,160
I'll mark your work.

508
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:38,240
You have until July 5th.

509
00:53:40,330 --> 00:53:42,710
Oh no, only five days left.

510
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:46,500
Too short?

511
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:49,210
Chin up.

512
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:52,550
If you succeed,
I'll kill myself instead of Mido.

513
00:53:55,970 --> 00:53:57,430
That's right, Mido.

514
00:53:58,140 --> 00:53:59,970
I'm going to kill

515
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:02,560
every woman you love until you die.

516
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:06,020
Well, you're notorious

517
00:54:06,190 --> 00:54:08,310
for not protecting your women anyway.

518
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:18,620
Wow, you're strong, Mr Monster.

519
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:21,990
Yes, you are the monster
that I created.

520
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:26,330
But you will never

521
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:28,920
find out why
if you go through with this.

522
00:54:29,590 --> 00:54:31,840
You have been curious for 15 years...

523
00:54:32,590 --> 00:54:34,300
Are you still going to kill me?

524
00:54:43,970 --> 00:54:45,100
Sit down there.

525
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:54,740
Ah, the tooth torture!

526
00:54:56,610 --> 00:54:58,360
You won't have enough time.

527
00:54:59,450 --> 00:55:02,330
I have a pacemaker
for my weak heart.

528
00:55:03,450 --> 00:55:04,660
When it was put in...

529
00:55:06,710 --> 00:55:08,920
..do you know
what I said to the doctor?

530
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:13,630
"Dr Hopkins,

531
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:15,590
give me...

532
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,140
..a remote control
to turn my motor off."

533
00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:21,930
"Pardon? Why?"

534
00:55:24,770 --> 00:55:28,690
"So that I can kill myself. Easily.
At any time."

535
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:32,520
"I'll pay you an extra $100,000
for this."

536
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:49,370
What a dilemma.

537
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:52,460
You want to kill me right now,

538
00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:55,250
but then you won't know
why you were imprisoned.

539
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:59,930
You want to torture me,
but I say I'll kill myself first.

540
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:05,720
Revenge? Or the truth?

541
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:10,690
What a problem for you.

542
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:14,320
I've been watching over you
for 15 years.

543
00:56:16,570 --> 00:56:18,490
I've faired well thanks to you.

544
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:22,280
I wasn't bored or lonely.

545
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:29,080
Seeking revenge is the best cure
for someone who has been hurt.

546
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:30,370
Try it.

547
00:56:32,290 --> 00:56:34,540
The loss of 15 years,

548
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:38,010
the pain of losing
your wife and child,

549
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:40,470
all this can be forgotten.

550
00:56:41,090 --> 00:56:44,850
Once again,
revenge is good for your health.

551
00:56:45,470 --> 00:56:46,350
But...

552
00:56:47,970 --> 00:56:50,520
What happens
after you've had your revenge?

553
00:56:51,770 --> 00:56:55,230
I bet that hidden pain
probably emerges again.

554
00:56:58,650 --> 00:57:00,240
Are you there, Oh Dae-su?

555
00:57:02,530 --> 00:57:03,700
Oh Dae-su.

556
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:06,030
Long time no see.

557
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:18,750
Hasn't she been tied up too long?
You left her door open.

558
00:57:32,690 --> 00:57:34,150
Save me, Dae-su!

559
00:57:36,610 --> 00:57:38,150
<i>I can't. I'm going to die.</i>

560
00:57:48,330 --> 00:57:50,040
This dentist is very good.

561
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:00,050
Keep still.

562
00:58:00,340 --> 00:58:02,510
Keep still.

563
00:58:03,630 --> 00:58:04,760
What's his problem?

564
00:58:33,830 --> 00:58:35,330
You see...

565
00:58:36,830 --> 00:58:38,920
..they say that people

566
00:58:39,710 --> 00:58:42,460
shrivel up
because of their imagination.

567
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:46,630
So do not imagine anything.

568
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:50,010
You'll become brave as hell.

569
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:52,310
Now here comes the real thing.

570
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:29,050
Sir, I'm glad
you told me about this place...

571
00:59:30,590 --> 00:59:33,010
..but I haven't even started yet!

572
00:59:48,950 --> 00:59:49,990
Let's go.

573
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:08,010
Let's go now.

574
01:00:09,050 --> 01:00:10,340
Let's fight.

575
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:14,850
Let's fight.

576
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:23,150
- What a tough guy!
- Your hand.

577
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:26,110
I'll chop off your hand.

578
01:00:27,610 --> 01:00:31,360
You touched Mido's breasts.

579
01:00:36,450 --> 01:00:38,160
Let's get out of this dump.

580
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:56,720
So do you trust me now, you bastard?

581
01:01:00,430 --> 01:01:02,940
It looks hard to accomplish.

582
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:04,690
I looked into it.

583
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:07,690
The reason the bank
refused to pay $270 million

584
01:01:07,860 --> 01:01:10,400
was not due to
any building irregularities.

585
01:01:10,570 --> 01:01:12,280
They have internal problems.

586
01:01:16,530 --> 01:01:19,910
So I don't think
we'll have any trouble.

587
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:25,420
Chairman Choi's
23 clients' shares are at 25% ...

588
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:34,220
Dae-su.

589
01:01:35,590 --> 01:01:36,760
Yeah?

590
01:01:39,890 --> 01:01:42,810
Did he really say that he'd kill me?

591
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:45,770
Yeah.

592
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:49,360
Because I'm the woman you love?

593
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:56,490
Dae-su.

594
01:01:58,740 --> 01:01:59,910
What?

595
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:03,960
<i>Where is my love?</i>

596
01:02:05,750 --> 01:02:08,540
<i>I'm getting lonelier in the nights</i>

597
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:15,130
<i>The words you send with your eyes</i>

598
01:02:17,260 --> 01:02:20,350
<i>I can feel with my hand</i>

599
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:25,230
<i>So many nights have passed</i>

600
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:29,900
<i>My heart is going to you</i>

601
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:35,240
<i>As I shed my sad tears</i>

602
01:02:35,950 --> 01:02:39,990
<i>You're the face I miss.</i>

603
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:48,830
They packed up their stuff
and left in a rental car.

604
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:55,220
Also, Mido called the restaurant
and left her job.

605
01:02:59,010 --> 01:03:01,260
Let's go after this is done.

606
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:05,730
You should get some rest today, sir.

607
01:03:07,770 --> 01:03:09,560
I can't even sleep.

608
01:03:10,610 --> 01:03:12,360
Because I am lonely.

609
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:14,570
Mr Han.

610
01:03:15,990 --> 01:03:17,910
Do you really think...

611
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:21,780
..that Mido has fallen in love
with Oh Dae-su?

612
01:03:23,950 --> 01:03:25,330
Already?

613
01:03:45,770 --> 01:03:47,020
Dae-su!

614
01:03:48,190 --> 01:03:49,650
It hurts so much.

615
01:03:50,650 --> 01:03:52,860
But I'll endure it.

616
01:03:54,570 --> 01:03:55,780
You must understand.

617
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:13,880
How did you hold out for 15 years?

618
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:16,010
There's always a way.

619
01:04:17,470 --> 01:04:19,300
Do you like it?

620
01:04:20,970 --> 01:04:22,550
You do like it, don't you?

621
01:04:23,350 --> 01:04:25,470
I want to make you feel good, Dae-su.

622
01:04:54,250 --> 01:04:56,380
<i>You need not worry about the future.</i>

623
01:04:58,130 --> 01:04:59,550
<i>Imagine nothing.</i>

624
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:14,270
<i>I am grateful for</i>
<i>all those years spent in that prison.</i>

625
01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:21,070
<i>If I was the old Oh Dae-su,</i>
<i>would Mido still have liked me?</i>

626
01:06:57,670 --> 01:07:02,380
<i>He could only have known that I said</i>
<i>I would chop off Mr Park's hand</i>

627
01:07:03,010 --> 01:07:05,050
<i>by putting a bug on us.</i>

628
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:08,050
<i>And he knew</i>
<i>where we were by tailing us.</i>

629
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:10,470
I'VE BEEN BUGGED. PLEASE FIND IT.

630
01:07:10,850 --> 01:07:12,220
<i>You know,</i>

631
01:07:12,770 --> 01:07:14,850
<i>maybe he freed you</i>

632
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:19,150
<i>because he has fun watching you</i>
<i>run wild seeking revenge.</i>

633
01:07:21,020 --> 01:07:25,030
<i>And he'll never tell you why,</i>
<i>so he can toy with you forever.</i>

634
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:28,490
<i>Is that why?</i>

01:07:56,140 --> 01:07:57,770
WELCOME TO EVERGREEN OLD BOYS

643
01:07:57,940 --> 01:08:01,060
THE SANGNOK HIGH SCHOOL
ALUMNI HOMEPAGE.

644
01:08:18,410 --> 01:08:19,920
<i>I should be locking up now.</i>

645
01:08:20,250 --> 01:08:23,710
Can I just look at
the records for the class of '79?

646
01:08:29,130 --> 01:08:31,090
It's dark. Put the lights on.

647
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:37,140
Take your time.

648
01:08:37,310 --> 01:08:39,390
LEE WOO-JIN

649
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:42,100
Joo-hwan?

650
01:08:42,270 --> 01:08:43,730
Let me ask you something.

651
01:08:44,900 --> 01:08:47,110
Do you remember
Lee Woo-jin from school?

652
01:08:47,860 --> 01:08:49,820
I think he went to study in America.

653
01:08:50,780 --> 01:08:51,820
<i>Lee Woo-jin?</i>

654
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:56,120
<i>I don't know him.</i>
<i>So is that the bastard's name?</i>

655
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:58,330
<i>How did you find out?</i>

656
01:08:58,950 --> 01:09:01,580
<i>I looked through</i>
<i>all the school yearbooks.</i>

657
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:05,090
<i>I need more than just a name.</i>

658
01:09:05,250 --> 01:09:06,710
<i>Got anything else?</i>

659
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:09,800
<i>Look at the student records.</i>

660
01:09:10,010 --> 01:09:13,010
<i>Do you know Lee Soo-ah?</i>
<i>She was in our year.</i>

661
01:09:13,180 --> 01:09:14,220
<i>Lee Soo-ah?</i>

662
01:09:15,010 --> 01:09:16,310
<i>She died.</i>

663
01:09:16,930 --> 01:09:19,770
<i>- What classroom was she in?</i>
<i>- Room two, I think.</i>

664
01:09:19,980 --> 01:09:21,640
<i>She was in my room.</i>

665
01:09:21,850 --> 01:09:24,310
<i>Next to yours.</i>
<i>So what about her?</i>

666
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:27,690
Why is there no photo?

667
01:09:30,570 --> 01:09:33,320
She died. That must be why.

668
01:09:33,490 --> 01:09:34,780
How did Lee Soo-ah die?

669
01:09:35,910 --> 01:09:37,370
<i>Yeah, you wouldn't know.</i>

670
01:09:37,580 --> 01:09:40,000
<i>She died after you moved schools.</i>

671
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:46,380
<i>She went to the Habchun Dam alone</i>
<i>and fell into the water.</i>

672
01:09:46,540 --> 01:09:48,920
<i>She bit the dust.</i>

673
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:56,390
<i>One week later, they found</i>
<i>her bloated body in the water.</i>

674
01:09:57,260 --> 01:09:59,680
- What was she like?
- <i>Her?</i>

675
01:09:59,890 --> 01:10:01,980
She was a total slut.

676
01:10:02,140 --> 01:10:05,900
On the outside,
she acted like a lady,

677
01:10:06,060 --> 01:10:09,610
but inside she was just
a filthy whore.

678
01:10:09,780 --> 01:10:14,280
The rumour going around school
was that she'd fuck anyone.

679
01:10:15,780 --> 01:10:18,030
I should have got in there.

680
01:10:19,910 --> 01:10:24,370
I also heard that her family
was filthy rich.

681
01:10:25,330 --> 01:10:27,250
Her grades were good, too.

682
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:31,460
But the worst thing was
that she was a total slut.

683
01:10:32,130 --> 01:10:34,880
God, this is such an old story.

684
01:10:35,050 --> 01:10:38,550
Dae-su, I can't remember
because it was so long ago,

685
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:40,810
but that Soo-ah, well...

686
01:10:56,070 --> 01:10:58,070
<i>Joo-hwan, what is it?</i>

687
01:10:58,870 --> 01:11:03,620
<i>Joo-hwan, is something wrong?</i>

688
01:11:11,050 --> 01:11:12,210
Oh Dae-su.

689
01:11:13,420 --> 01:11:14,920
My sister...

690
01:11:16,050 --> 01:11:17,760
..was no slut.

691
01:11:19,550 --> 01:11:21,680
You must believe that.

692
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:28,600
You got rid of your bug so
I had to come all the way here.

693
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:31,730
To eavesdrop.

694
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:34,190
That's why Joo-hwan is dead...

695
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:37,860
..because of you.

696
01:11:38,910 --> 01:11:39,990
OK?

697
01:11:52,460 --> 01:11:54,510
<i>You bastard, I'm coming for you!</i>

698
01:11:55,300 --> 01:11:59,680
<i>I'm going to kill you!</i>

699
01:12:20,070 --> 01:12:21,370
You son of a bitch!

700
01:12:42,390 --> 01:12:45,850
We're not open yet.
Come back in an hour, please.

701
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:50,020
This place was recommended
by someone with six gold teeth.

702
01:12:58,820 --> 01:12:59,860
Mr Park?

703
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:03,160
I had to move because of you.

704
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:06,120
To celebrate the occasion...

705
01:13:07,330 --> 01:13:09,370
..I installed a new TV.

706
01:13:09,540 --> 01:13:11,370
Do you like it?

707
01:13:12,830 --> 01:13:16,050
It's got so many channels.
Great, isn't it?

708
01:13:16,210 --> 01:13:18,630
Some prisoners
don't want to leave at all.

709
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:22,090
You lived in a place like this
for 15 years, Dae-su?

710
01:13:22,890 --> 01:13:25,180
After 11 years it felt like home.

711
01:13:26,180 --> 01:13:30,100
Come on, I don't need your money.

712
01:13:30,810 --> 01:13:32,690
My enemy's enemy is my friend.

713
01:13:38,730 --> 01:13:41,150
We threw away the hand
because it rotted.

714
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:42,570
I've missed you.

715
01:13:44,070 --> 01:13:47,120
Bastard. You'll pay for this.

716
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:53,040
So why did you bring me here?

717
01:13:59,590 --> 01:14:03,010
If I don't return after July 5th,
let her go.

718
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:11,480
While I was locked up here,
I remember someone visiting me.

719
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:14,560
What did that person do?

720
01:14:14,730 --> 01:14:16,270
Was it three times?

721
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:20,990
I put a hypnosis-inducing drug
in your water.

722
01:14:21,150 --> 01:14:22,700
Sodium barbiturate?

723
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:25,200
He's a genius!

724
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,460
WATERWHEEL HAIR SALON

725
01:14:47,220 --> 01:14:48,720
That's rubbish.

726
01:14:48,890 --> 01:14:51,020
Even though it was a Catholic school,

727
01:14:51,850 --> 01:14:54,480
those rumours wouldn't have
killed her.

728
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:56,900
There was probably something else.

729
01:14:58,150 --> 01:15:01,780
Could she have been pregnant, maybe?

730
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:07,490
I really don't think
Soo-ah was like that.

731
01:15:07,700 --> 01:15:10,580
She was such a pure girl.

732
01:15:10,780 --> 01:15:12,750
I know she never went with anyone.

733
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:18,580
But she did go out
with someone back then.

734
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:22,880
Do you want to know who he was?

735
01:15:24,550 --> 01:15:26,380
I haven't got a clue!

736
01:15:39,860 --> 01:15:40,900
Choon-shim.

737
01:15:42,230 --> 01:15:45,650
You knew Lee Soo-ah, didn't you?
Who was her boyfriend?

738
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:48,320
You don't know?

739
01:15:49,070 --> 01:15:50,910
You silly cow.

740
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:52,410
You don't know

741
01:15:52,620 --> 01:15:55,000
because friendship
means nothing to you.

742
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:56,210
Shut up.

743
01:15:56,660 --> 01:15:58,330
Who would know?

744
01:15:59,630 --> 01:16:00,750
Who?

745
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:02,090
Joo-hwan?

746
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:07,340
What?

747
01:16:09,260 --> 01:16:11,220
Yeah, I know him.

748
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:14,180
But why would he know?

749
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:16,520
Yeah?

750
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:18,600
Really?

751
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:21,860
OK. I'll call you back in a bit.

752
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:29,660
Well...

753
01:16:31,030 --> 01:16:33,780
She said it was Joo-hwan
who told her the rumours

754
01:16:34,540 --> 01:16:37,120
and that you should know
more than anyone.

755
01:16:51,930 --> 01:16:53,890
<i>Ring, ring.</i>

756
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:55,890
<i>Move aside.</i>

757
01:16:59,390 --> 01:17:01,020
<i>You'll get hurt...</i>

758
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:05,860
<i>..if you get in the way.</i>

759
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:19,540
OH DAE-SU

760
01:17:35,470 --> 01:17:36,720
Good Lord!

761
01:17:36,890 --> 01:17:39,770
You rascal. Put it out!

762
01:17:39,980 --> 01:17:44,020
I'm leaving today. For Seoul.

763
01:17:45,730 --> 01:17:47,570
So just you leave me alone, missy.

764
01:17:48,570 --> 01:17:49,940
You good-for-nothing!

765
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:48,840
You're Oh Dae-su, aren't you?

766
01:18:50,750 --> 01:18:53,130
And you are...

767
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:55,550
I heard
you're popular with the girls.

768
01:18:56,680 --> 01:18:58,850
You know what rumours are like.

769
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:02,850
I heard you're really funny.
Say something.

770
01:19:04,690 --> 01:19:09,360
It's not good
to be stuck with one image.

771
01:19:19,620 --> 01:19:21,700
OK, there's this father and son.

772
01:19:21,870 --> 01:19:24,620
They went
to the swimming pool and...

773
01:19:24,790 --> 01:19:25,920
See you later.

774
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:55,740
TAKE CARE FUCKHEADS OF
YEAR 3, CLASS 3.

775
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:54,300
- Come on.
- Wait.

776
01:20:56,670 --> 01:20:58,840
- Come here.
- No.

777
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:02,850
Come here.

778
01:21:03,010 --> 01:21:04,600
OK, OK.

779
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:14,480
Satisfied?

780
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:17,570
- Lift this up.
- No way.

781
01:21:17,740 --> 01:21:19,400
- Lift it up.
- No.

782
01:21:34,420 --> 01:21:35,460
What?

783
01:21:44,090 --> 01:21:45,850
That tickles.

784
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:16,290
Give me those.

785
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:23,130
What are you doing?

786
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:24,470
Let me see.

787
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:25,930
What are you doing?

788
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:29,060
- Let me see.
- Stop it!

789
01:22:39,730 --> 01:22:41,030
Go away.

790
01:24:23,130 --> 01:24:25,460
Was it really Soo-ah? Are you sure?

791
01:24:26,340 --> 01:24:27,880
I don't know her name.

792
01:24:28,630 --> 01:24:32,640
I just know that she's in your class
and she rides a red bike.

793
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:43,230
Have a good trip.
See you in Seoul.

794
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:44,860
Where are you going?

795
01:24:45,030 --> 01:24:47,070
I've got a date with Choon-shim.

796
01:24:48,110 --> 01:24:50,070
I'll kill you if you blab to anyone.

797
01:24:55,330 --> 01:24:56,370
<i>No way.</i>

798
01:24:58,330 --> 01:25:01,750
<i>You got locked up for 15 years</i>
<i>just for saying that?</i>

799
01:25:04,460 --> 01:25:06,170
<i>Is that such a crime?</i>

800
01:25:09,130 --> 01:25:11,800
"Whether it be a grain of sand
or a rock,

801
01:25:11,970 --> 01:25:14,010
in water they both sink alike."

802
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:19,560
That's Lee Woo-jin's attitude.

803
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:22,940
So,

804
01:25:23,610 --> 01:25:25,570
what's the significance of July 5th?

805
01:25:27,150 --> 01:25:28,190
That's the day...

806
01:25:31,610 --> 01:25:32,780
..Lee Soo-ah died.

807
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:40,460
It's over now.

808
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:43,130
You were fighting for the truth,

809
01:25:43,290 --> 01:25:45,340
not for revenge, weren't you?

810
01:25:48,010 --> 01:25:51,930
Now, we'll run away
where Woo-jin can never follow us.

811
01:25:55,850 --> 01:25:57,260
<i>I can't end it like this.</i>

812
01:25:58,220 --> 01:26:00,640
Vengeance has become a part of me.

813
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:09,030
But you don't even know
where he lives.

814
01:26:10,570 --> 01:26:13,950
<i>"Like a gazelle</i>
<i>from the hand of the hunter...</i>

815
01:26:14,160 --> 01:26:17,370
<i>"Like a bird</i>
<i>from the snare of the fowler...</i>

816
01:26:17,540 --> 01:26:18,620
<i>"Free yourself. "

817
01:26:19,870 --> 01:26:24,290
<i>It is taken from the Book</i>
<i>of Proverbs, chapter six, verse four.</i>

818
01:26:24,500 --> 01:26:25,840
<i>And Evergreen...</i>

819
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:28,800
<i>..said he lives in a high tower.</i>

820
01:26:30,090 --> 01:26:32,420
<i>So six and four...</i>

821
01:26:33,510 --> 01:26:34,800
<i>..must be floors.</i>

822
01:26:36,260 --> 01:26:37,300
<i>Fourth floor.</i>

823
01:26:38,640 --> 01:26:40,020
<i>Sixth floor.</i>

824
01:26:40,890 --> 01:26:42,310
<i>Or the 64th floor?</i>

825
01:26:45,350 --> 01:26:46,400
<i>P?</i>

826
01:26:47,110 --> 01:26:48,400
<i>Penthouse!</i>

827
01:26:52,030 --> 01:26:54,160
<i>Please insert the code.</i>

828
01:27:00,450 --> 01:27:02,500
What would you like me to pray for?

829
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:07,130
<i>Wrong entry.</i>

830
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:09,880
<i>Please re-enter.</i>

831
01:27:14,970 --> 01:27:18,850
<i>Wrong entry. Please re-enter.</i>

832
01:27:19,010 --> 01:27:20,060
"Dear Lord...

833
01:27:22,310 --> 01:27:23,730
..please let me...

834
01:27:25,100 --> 01:27:27,520
..meet a younger man next time."

835
01:28:17,860 --> 01:28:19,620
Please make Woo-jin...

836
01:28:20,830 --> 01:28:22,540
..kneel before Dae-su...

837
01:28:24,250 --> 01:28:27,080
..and beg for forgiveness.

838
01:28:40,760 --> 01:28:42,390
You slept with your sister.

839
01:28:53,900 --> 01:28:55,570
Let's go upstairs and talk.

840
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:19,970
Get him!

841
01:29:42,910 --> 01:29:45,080
Just talk.

842
01:30:15,900 --> 01:30:17,440
That's better.

843
01:30:19,610 --> 01:30:21,280
You slept with your sister.

844
01:30:21,450 --> 01:30:22,700
So refreshing.

845
01:30:29,450 --> 01:30:31,870
And I started the rumours.

846
01:30:32,830 --> 01:30:34,540
That's why your sister died.

847
01:30:42,130 --> 01:30:44,970
Looking in the mirror
reminds me of that day.

848
01:30:45,970 --> 01:30:47,100
How about you?

849
01:30:47,260 --> 01:30:51,480
Erasing my memory and telling me
to find the truth was cowardly.

850
01:30:52,940 --> 01:30:54,230
I won...

851
01:30:56,650 --> 01:30:58,570
..so die like you promised.

852
01:30:58,770 --> 01:31:02,240
Did you think you'd forgotten
that day because you were hypnotized?

853
01:31:03,900 --> 01:31:04,780
<i>Really?</i>

854
01:31:06,450 --> 01:31:09,370
Do you know the real reason
why you can't remember?

855
01:31:12,750 --> 01:31:13,870
It's because...

856
01:31:18,250 --> 01:31:19,710
..you just forgot.

857
01:31:20,590 --> 01:31:23,220
Is that not exciting enough for you?

858
01:31:23,380 --> 01:31:26,430
Well, it's true, you just forgot.

859
01:31:26,840 --> 01:31:29,430
Why? Because
it wasn't important to you.

860
01:31:30,760 --> 01:31:32,520
Your rumour got so out of hand,

861
01:31:32,730 --> 01:31:36,020
that the next rumour
was that Soo-ah was pregnant.

862
01:31:36,190 --> 01:31:40,650
My sister got sucked into that rumour
and began believing it.

863
01:31:41,320 --> 01:31:44,990
So her periods stopped
and her belly began to swell.

864
01:31:45,990 --> 01:31:47,530
Fascinating, isn't it?

865
01:31:47,740 --> 01:31:51,490
Imagine how a girl would feel to
carry both her child and her nephew.

866
01:31:51,910 --> 01:31:53,450
Do you understand now?

867
01:31:54,710 --> 01:31:58,540
Your tongue got my sister pregnant.

868
01:32:00,630 --> 01:32:02,760
It wasn't Lee Woo-jin's dick.

869
01:32:04,510 --> 01:32:05,880
It was Oh Dae-su's tongue.

870
01:32:11,720 --> 01:32:13,640
Is that why you killed your sister?

871
01:32:14,100 --> 01:32:15,730
Imagine how a boy would feel,

872
01:32:15,730 --> 01:32:18,060
fathering both his child
and his nephew?

873
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:23,940
You were probably afraid.

874
01:32:24,530 --> 01:32:27,570
Afraid that everyone would know
once the baby was born.

875
01:32:29,240 --> 01:32:32,660
After you killed her, you realised it
was a phantom pregnancy...

876
01:32:33,950 --> 01:32:35,580
..so your hating me...

877
01:32:37,620 --> 01:32:38,790
..is understandable.

878
01:32:44,300 --> 01:32:46,670
They said Soo-ah died alone
at the dam,

879
01:32:47,550 --> 01:32:48,930
so who took this photo?

880
01:32:50,760 --> 01:32:52,640
And what about the date, July 5th?

881
01:33:00,350 --> 01:33:02,690
This is no fun.

882
01:33:03,570 --> 01:33:05,900
I'll just finish what I was saying.

883
01:33:06,530 --> 01:33:09,240
Listen carefully.
My story is really exciting.

884
01:33:09,700 --> 01:33:11,990
<i>Ever heard</i>
<i>of post-hypnotic suggestion?</i>

885
01:33:12,200 --> 01:33:14,450
<i>You suggest something</i>
<i>during hypnosis,</i>

886
01:33:14,620 --> 01:33:16,870
<i>then it's performed</i>
<i>in your wakened state.</i>

887
01:33:19,170 --> 01:33:20,880
Still haven't worked it out?

888
01:33:27,010 --> 01:33:29,930
You let a stranger into your home.
Who are you?

889
01:33:30,760 --> 01:33:32,850
<i>What about you, you bastard?</i>

890
01:33:38,310 --> 01:33:40,850
<i>We hypnotized both of you.</i>

891
01:33:42,440 --> 01:33:45,570
<i>One fortunate thing was that,</i>
<i>compared to others,</i>

892
01:33:46,190 --> 01:33:48,610
<i>both of you</i>
<i>were receptive to hypnosis.</i>

893
01:33:50,280 --> 01:33:51,570
<i>Isn't this fun?</i>

894
01:33:51,740 --> 01:33:55,870
<i>One word gets you pregnant.</i>
<i>Another makes you fall in love.</i>

895
01:33:58,910 --> 01:34:03,130
But no matter how receptive
you two were to hypnosis,

896
01:34:03,290 --> 01:34:06,920
and no matter how good
a hypnotist Miss Yoo is,

897
01:34:07,090 --> 01:34:09,840
getting people
to fall in love isn't easy.

898
01:34:12,130 --> 01:34:13,550
Do you know how we did it?

899
01:34:17,100 --> 01:34:19,430
Your first suggestion, of course,

900
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:21,600
was to go to that restaurant

901
01:34:21,770 --> 01:34:24,360
straight after your release.

902
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:28,610
Next, to react
to the mobile phone's ringtone.

903
01:34:29,860 --> 01:34:33,910
When you heard this,
you were programmed to say something.

904
01:34:35,370 --> 01:34:36,410
Who are you?

905
01:34:38,370 --> 01:34:40,000
Do you

906
01:34:40,160 --> 01:34:41,620
like your clothes?

907
01:34:43,080 --> 01:34:46,040
<i>And Mido was programmed</i>
<i>to react to the man</i>

908
01:34:46,210 --> 01:34:47,800
<i>who would say this.</i>

909
01:34:47,960 --> 01:34:51,510
<i>When she touched your hand,</i>
<i>your reaction would be...</i>

910
01:34:55,550 --> 01:34:58,640
Your gravest mistake
wasn't failing to find the answer.

911
01:34:59,770 --> 01:35:01,350
If you keep

912
01:35:01,560 --> 01:35:05,350
asking the wrong questions,
you'll never find the right answer.

913
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:10,110
It's not,
"Why did Woo-jin imprison me?"

914
01:35:10,530 --> 01:35:13,280
It's "Why did he release me?"

915
01:35:13,450 --> 01:35:15,320
Once again...

916
01:35:16,370 --> 01:35:20,450
..why did Woo-jin
release Dae-su after...

917
01:35:22,120 --> 01:35:24,120
..15 years?

918
01:37:25,660 --> 01:37:28,960
LAUGH, AND THE WORLD LAUGHS
WITH YOU. WEEP, AND YOU WEEP
ALONE.

919
01:39:10,100 --> 01:39:11,390
<i>Mr Han.</i>

920
01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:21,820
<i>Mr Han!</i>

921
01:40:02,490 --> 01:40:03,740
Mido...

922
01:40:10,580 --> 01:40:11,950
Mido doesn't know?

923
01:40:17,290 --> 01:40:19,340
Why did you hide her there?

924
01:40:21,340 --> 01:40:24,590
Did you think he'd hate me
just because I cut off his hand?

925
01:40:24,970 --> 01:40:27,130
Didn't you work out
that it was a trap?

926
01:40:29,510 --> 01:40:32,720
How can you protect your woman
with that brain?

927
01:40:34,230 --> 01:40:38,060
I've secretly been raising Mido
since she was three.

928
01:40:39,480 --> 01:40:41,480
What's wrong with you?

929
01:40:42,610 --> 01:40:44,240
Mr Park's hand?

930
01:40:46,030 --> 01:40:47,320
You moron.

931
01:40:48,490 --> 01:40:52,830
Did you see his new prison? I gave
him that building for his hand!

932
01:40:52,990 --> 01:40:54,200
Me!

933
01:41:18,980 --> 01:41:20,190
Dae-su!

934
01:41:22,230 --> 01:41:24,070
In front of me

935
01:41:24,280 --> 01:41:26,360
there's some kind of box.

936
01:41:26,530 --> 01:41:28,360
He's telling me to open it.

937
01:41:28,990 --> 01:41:30,740
It's the same violet box...

938
01:41:30,950 --> 01:41:31,910
No!

939
01:41:32,740 --> 01:41:35,080
No, Mido, don't.

940
01:41:35,240 --> 01:41:37,660
Don't open it, no matter what.

941
01:41:37,830 --> 01:41:40,080
Or something terrible will happen.

942
01:41:40,290 --> 01:41:43,420
What's in it?
You know, don't you?

943
01:41:43,960 --> 01:41:46,420
Mido, just wait a little longer.

944
01:41:47,210 --> 01:41:48,970
Dae-su will be there soon.

945
01:41:49,130 --> 01:41:52,140
I'll be there very soon.

946
01:41:54,180 --> 01:41:56,390
Can't you come now?

947
01:41:58,810 --> 01:42:00,020
I'm scared.

948
01:42:00,230 --> 01:42:02,190
Little Mido, you can wait, can't you?

949
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:03,520
Yes.

950
01:42:04,440 --> 01:42:06,730
Very good. Good girl.

951
01:42:07,860 --> 01:42:11,490
I'll call you back very soon, OK?

952
01:42:26,710 --> 01:42:27,760
Please.

953
01:42:31,180 --> 01:42:32,890
Don't tell Mido.

954
01:42:37,640 --> 01:42:39,310
What has she done wrong?

955
01:42:41,850 --> 01:42:43,400
You know it was all my fault.

956
01:42:47,530 --> 01:42:48,900
I have...

957
01:42:50,490 --> 01:42:52,660
..committed an unforgivable sin...

958
01:42:53,660 --> 01:42:55,450
..against your sister.

959
01:42:57,330 --> 01:42:59,410
And I also...

960
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:02,330
..did you wrong.

961
01:43:03,870 --> 01:43:04,920
But...

962
01:43:06,840 --> 01:43:08,920
..please leave Mido alone.

963
01:43:14,760 --> 01:43:15,800
If by any chance...

964
01:43:17,350 --> 01:43:19,350
..Mido finds out the truth,

965
01:43:20,350 --> 01:43:22,350
you son of a bitch,

966
01:43:22,980 --> 01:43:26,610
I'll tear you limb from limb.

967
01:43:27,820 --> 01:43:31,900
And your remains will never be found.

968
01:43:32,070 --> 01:43:33,450
Why?

969
01:43:33,610 --> 01:43:36,280
Because I'm going
to swallow every last bit.

970
01:43:38,830 --> 01:43:39,950
Woo-jin!

971
01:43:40,910 --> 01:43:43,370
Please, sir, I made a mistake.

972
01:43:43,710 --> 01:43:47,000
Please forget what I said.

973
01:43:47,170 --> 01:43:49,500
Sir! Woo-jin!

974
01:43:50,460 --> 01:43:54,550
We're Evergreen Old Boys, remember?

975
01:43:55,590 --> 01:44:01,640
<i>With the energy</i>
<i>of a green pine tree</i>

976
01:44:04,810 --> 01:44:08,400
<i>The Great Sangnok High...</i>

977
01:44:11,940 --> 01:44:15,110
I'll do whatever you want.

978
01:44:15,320 --> 01:44:17,450
I'll do anything. I beg you.

979
01:44:18,120 --> 01:44:23,290
Woo-jin, if you want me
to be your dog, I will!

980
01:44:23,450 --> 01:44:27,370
From this moment on,
I am Woo-jin's dog!

981
01:44:27,540 --> 01:44:28,580
I'm your bitch.

982
01:44:35,220 --> 01:44:37,380
Look, I'm wagging my tail.

983
01:44:38,010 --> 01:44:40,930
I'm a dog. I'll guard your house.

984
01:44:41,100 --> 01:44:43,720
I'll be your slave.

985
01:46:51,390 --> 01:46:52,850
The box...

986
01:46:58,610 --> 01:47:00,030
..just leave it closed.

987
01:47:10,910 --> 01:47:11,960
Now...

988
01:47:15,080 --> 01:47:17,380
..what will I live for?

989
01:48:19,860 --> 01:48:21,030
<i>Dae-su.</i>

990
01:48:21,820 --> 01:48:23,490
<i>It hurts so much.</i>

991
01:48:24,280 --> 01:48:26,110
<i>But I'll endure it.</i>

992
01:48:27,200 --> 01:48:28,570
<i>You must understand.</i>

993
01:48:52,770 --> 01:48:56,060
My sister and I loved each other,
despite everything.

994
01:49:00,560 --> 01:49:02,230
Can you two do the same?

995
01:49:45,730 --> 01:49:46,570
Soo-ah.

996
01:50:02,590 --> 01:50:03,790
Woo-jin.

997
01:50:05,670 --> 01:50:07,670
I know you've always been afraid.

998
01:50:10,510 --> 01:50:13,260
So just let go of me.

999
01:50:30,320 --> 01:50:33,200
Please remember me.

1000
01:50:41,710 --> 01:50:44,420
I have no regrets. Do you?

1001
01:51:29,960 --> 01:51:33,800
<i>This is the whole adventure</i>
<i>of my life until now.</i>

1002
01:51:33,970 --> 01:51:37,510
<i>Thank you for listening</i>
<i>to this terrible story to the end.</i>

1003
01:51:38,220 --> 01:51:42,640
<i>I trust that you will understand</i>
<i>my sending a letter</i>

1004
01:51:42,810 --> 01:51:46,440
<i>instead of talking to you in person.</i>

1005
01:51:46,610 --> 01:51:48,520
<i>This is because</i>
<i>I have no tongue.</i>

1006
01:51:48,690 --> 01:51:51,360
To be honest,
there's no reason I should help you.

1007
01:51:57,240 --> 01:51:58,620
But there was one thing.

1008
01:51:59,830 --> 01:52:02,120
I was touched by this last sentence.

1009
01:52:04,170 --> 01:52:09,800
EVEN THOUGH
I'M NO BETTER THAN A BEAST,

1010
01:52:09,960 --> 01:52:13,470
DON'T I HAVE THE RIGHT TO LIVE?

1011
01:52:16,390 --> 01:52:19,390
The hypnosis may go wrong
and distort your memories.

1012
01:52:21,310 --> 01:52:22,600
Do you want to proceed?

1013
01:52:43,830 --> 01:52:45,660
If you're ready...

1014
01:52:47,500 --> 01:52:49,500
..look at that tree.

1015
01:53:06,480 --> 01:53:07,730
The tree...

1016
01:53:08,770 --> 01:53:11,820
..is slowly changing
into a concrete pillar.

1017
01:53:20,450 --> 01:53:24,370
You're now
inside Lee Woo-jin's penthouse.

1018
01:53:25,500 --> 01:53:27,160
<i>It's a dreary night.</i>

1019
01:53:30,460 --> 01:53:33,250
<i>The sound of your footsteps</i>
<i>crossing to the window</i>

1020
01:53:33,420 --> 01:53:35,260
<i>fills the room.</i>

1021
01:53:49,400 --> 01:53:52,940
<i>When I ring my bell...</i>

1022
01:53:54,400 --> 01:53:57,280
<i>..you'll split into two people.</i>

1023
01:54:01,410 --> 01:54:04,790
<i>One person doesn't know</i>
<i>your secret.: Oh Dae-su.</i>

1024
01:54:06,040 --> 01:54:08,870
<i>The one who knows your secret</i>
<i>is the monster.</i>

1025
01:54:10,330 --> 01:54:12,630
<i>When I ring the bell again,</i>

1026
01:54:12,790 --> 01:54:15,880
<i>the monster will turn around</i>
<i>and start walking.</i>

1027
01:54:20,720 --> 01:54:26,520
<i>With each step,</i>
<i>he will age by one year.</i>

1028
01:54:26,720 --> 01:54:29,600
<i>When he reaches 70,</i>
<i>the monster will die.</i>

1029
01:54:30,190 --> 01:54:31,690
<i>There's no need to worry.</i>

1030
01:54:32,690 --> 01:54:35,400
<i>It will be a very peaceful death.</i>

1031
01:54:43,070 --> 01:54:44,580
<i>Now, good luck to you.</i>

1032
01:55:27,240 --> 01:55:29,290
What's going on?

1033
01:55:30,250 --> 01:55:32,290
Look at you.

1034
01:56:01,440 --> 01:56:03,070
Who were you with?

1035
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:00,500
I love you...

1036
01:57:01,630 --> 01:57:02,880
..Dae-su..

1037
01:57:03,305 --> 01:58:03,763
