00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,330

00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:30,190
WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 5, 1975

00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:45,703
THE LOST HONOUR OF KATHARINA BLUM

4
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,543
Hello, Katharina?
What a noise.

5
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:23,215
Hans is so drunk we had to put him to bed.

6
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:26,134
And Klaus is on detail.

7
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:30,351
We've come here to try
and pick up someone else.

8
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,017
You nun, don't be so proper!
See you.

9
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,627
Let's take him with us.

10
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:00,790
Going to a party?

11
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,755
Want to come to a party?

12
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:12,302
If you care to accept me,

13
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:16,726
and without a costume.
- We'll get you a fake nose.

14
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:22,771
Where are we going?
- To a distant relative's, aunt Else.

15
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:26,945
We're from the same hometown.
- Nice aunt.

16
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:29,910
Don't touch me!
- We'll see.

17
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,121
Not so fast, man!

18
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:53,013
Shit!

19
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:57,771
Sheik Karl from Kuwait and his harem.

20
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:44,359
I need a napkin.
- What for?

21
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:47,400
A bottle of wine fell.
- Red or white wine?

22
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:50,240
Red wine.
- Just use salt.

23
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:52,951
This is pepper.
- Here you are.

24
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:13,566
Who's that beauty?
- My cousin, Katharina Blum.

25
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,867
The nun?

26
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,712
Everybody is feeling well.

27
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:40,892
Occupied!
They went right onto first name terms.

28
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:44,184
That was no encounter,
that was a reunion.

29
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:46,306
Occupied!

30
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:51,816
Woltersheim, Else. Mergentheimer Str. 3,
telephone 349462.

31
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:57,071
Blum, Katharina, address still unknown.
I'll call back. Over.

32
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:06,581
Talking to yourself?

33
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:12,253
Just telling myself a couple of new jokes.

34
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,968
You are nuts!
- You girls are pretty tasty.

35
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:20,262
Not so prudish, eh?
- You might need a little grease job.

36
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:27,681
Just a moment! Hach.

37
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:32,902
Good evening, Mr. D_A.
Beizmenne speaking.

38
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:35,238
Were you having dinner?

39
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:38,822
I need to continue the emergency service.

40
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:42,905
Two this time.
"Escape danger".

41
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:49,078
Woltersheim, Else
and Blum, Katharina.

42
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,543
Thank you, doctor. Good night.

43
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:03,236
THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 6, 1975
CARNIVAL NIGHT

44
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:05,900
Attention! Official police action!
- Who are you?

45
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,777
Get against the wall!
- Don't put up any resistance!

46
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:13,498
This is an official police action!
Don't put up any resistance!

47
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:25,380
Where is he?

48
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:28,301
Nobody here, boss.

49
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,931
Where is he?

50
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,729
He is gone.

51
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,317
Impossible!

52
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,282
Why?

53
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:54,239
We've watched the house since last night.

54
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,788
If he's not here, he can't be far.

55
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,833
If you want him to be able to walk,
better tell us where he is.

56
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:04,542
He can't have vanished into the air.
Go ahead!

57
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:08,045
Search for weapons!
- How do you know he was here?

58
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:13,017
You admit you gave him shelter!
When did he leave?

59
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:16,140
When I woke up,
Ludwig had already left.

60
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,434
Without a goodbye?
- Yes.

61
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:34,286
Did he fuck you?

62
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:41,078
I wouldn't use that word.

63
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:44,505
We know each other.

64
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:48,218
I've seen you somewhere before.

65
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:50,678
Yes, I work for the Blornas.

66
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:54,799
Please get dressed.

67
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:58,019
It looks bad if you're parading
in front of our employees.

68
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,388
I'm not parading.
I'm at home.

69
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:02,857
Mrs. Blum, plea...

70
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:06,023
What was that? Take care!
- Sorry.

71
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:09,898
Please get dressed!
- Don't be so nervous.

72
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:20,208
Give that to me.

73
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,295
Sharpshooters dismissed!
- Take a dress.

74
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:31,762
He slipped through your fingers again.

75
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,509
Maoding!

76
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:40,311
Come on.
The door stays open.

77
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,602
What's my crime?

78
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,724
Take your clothes off!

79
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:50,818
What did Ludwig do?
- The D.A. will explain.

80
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,907
Bend over!

81
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,411
You have a nice bathroom.

82
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:07,164
Four batteries,
a strong alarm-clock,

83
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,883
two reels of wire and various tools.

84
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:12,127
A short-haired wig, blond.

85
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:15,385
Books: two love stories,
three crime stories,

86
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:20,469
a biography of Napoleon,
and a biography of Queen Christina.

87
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:24,101
All from a book club.
Typically bourgeois literature.

88
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,224
Nothing else? No weapons?

89
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:28,981
We found this note in a crime novel.

90
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:32,071
No other clue for the time being.

91
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:37,828
What about the two cups on the table?

92
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,038
What use is this to you?

93
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:45,536
"I am a conscienceless, godless man,

94
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:50,086
but gold is revered, and so is its owner."

95
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:56,881
"The divine strength of gold
lies in its being, as the estranged,

96
00:16:57,016 --> 00:17:00,259
alienated
and self-alienating essence of Man.

97
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:03,102
It is the alienated property of Men."

98
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:05,438
Sit down here.

99
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:11,270
Did Gotten write that?
- No, it has nothing to do with Ludwig.

100
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:14,488
"Gold is revered,
and so is its owner."

101
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:19,904
Written by a bank-robber,
it makes sense.

102
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,451
It's by Karl Marx.
- Probably the early writings.

103
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,790
So you've read Marx?

104
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:27,877
No.
- Is that your handwriting?

105
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:31,882
Father Urbanus, a Dominican,
wrote it down for me.

106
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,751
You can check.
Hohenblumenberg convent.

107
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:39,131
You mean you know Marx
through the Dominicans?

108
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:42,926
You chose the wrong Order.

109
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:46,851
The police requests all occupants of the
house to supply any information they can.

110
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:51,102
Please report anything suspicious.

111
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,986
There she is!

112
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:05,912
The duty of the press
is to inform the public.

113
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,048
Take this down:
D.A. Hach speaking.

114
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:17,385
We're dealing here
with one or several terrorists,

115
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:21,677
militarily organised,
with little regard for human life.

116
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,852
Sucker!

117
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:49,951
Attention! The police requests
all occupants of the house

118
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:53,955
to supply any information they can.

119
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,696
You were on first name terms?
- Yes.

120
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:25,620
Without knowing him?
- Yes.

121
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:32,043
Didn't Hertha Scheumel
call before the party?

122
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,538
Yes.
- Why?

123
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:39,297
She asked if they
could bring someone.

124
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,760
Did she say whom?

125
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:45,928
She didn't know then.
They wanted to make a pick up.

126
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,802
And you sent your Ludwig!

127
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:53,106
Right after the call he comes
to that easily recognisable blonde

128
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:57,023
who was all dressed up.

129
00:19:57,154 --> 00:20:00,317
This sophisticated trick allows Blum

130
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:04,944
to introduce Gotten at her aunt's place,
without arousing suspicion.

131
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:07,992
There she gave up even trying to cover up.

132
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:12,413
As soon as he arrived,
both danced intimately.

133
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:15,165
I did dance with Ludwig,
but the rest isn't true.

134
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:18,999
Do you often dance with strangers?
- No.

135
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:22,844
You made an exception for Gotten,
although you never dance?

136
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:25,339
I did dance before.

137
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:29,593
With Dr. Blorna and his friends,
politicians and businessmen,

138
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:32,346
when I helped out evenings at parties.

139
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:36,145
After I got my car,
I turned down those invitations.

140
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:38,518
Why did you?

141
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:44,366
Because the men were often drunk,
and made advances to me.

142
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:48,954
Before that, I had to be driven home.

143
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:52,164
I danced with this man a couple of times.

144
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:56,498
We won't get personal.

145
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:00,874
Only answer the questions
that are put to you.

146
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:04,128
Gotten's advances didn't bother you?

147
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,846
Ludwig didn't make advances,

148
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:10,182
He was tender.
- Same thing.

149
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:12,302
It is not!

150
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:17,975
Advances are a one-sided action,

151
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:22,528
and tenderness is quite different.

152
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:26,320
It comes from both parties.
- Who cares about that?

153
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:30,241
We want to know if you had an appointment.

154
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:35,249
I won't sign if you keep "advances"
instead of "tenderness".

155
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:40,004
Alright, "tenderness".
Thank her if this takes forever.

156
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,123
We enjoy listening.

157
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:48,137
How come last night precisely
you didn't take your car?

158
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:55,269
It was safer by bus,

159
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:59,732
I didn't know how much I'd drink.
- You often get drunk?

160
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,609
No. In fact never.

161
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:08,366
Pardon. Once, someone got me drunk.

162
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:12,158
My husband.
- What are you telling me?

163
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:15,035
You said you never drink,
so why take the bus?

164
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,625
You know why you didn't take your car?

165
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:21,587
You wanted to leave with Gétten
in his Porsche!

166
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:27,176
I told you ...

167
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:30,638
I felt like getting drunk.

168
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:37,808
Instead, you split with him!

169
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:41,687
We know why.

170
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:50,237
How do you explain ...

171
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:54,613
You, who are so proper
that your friends call you "the nun" ...

172
00:22:56,166 --> 00:23:00,000
that you throw yourselves
into the arms of a stranger

173
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:05,920
to take him to your room
and have intercourse with him?

174
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,884
What is it? Love at first sight?
Tenderness?

175
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:13,264
Advances?
Or just a quick lay?

176
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:32,525
Want something to eat?
- No, thank you.

177
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:37,656
Don't put on airs.
You must be hungry.

178
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:41,493
We'd like to have a warm meal ourselves.

179
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:44,538
It is not as good as yours this morning,

180
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,914
but you didn't finish your breakfast.

181
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:50,885
No, thank you.
- You're only punishing yourself.

182
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:53,212
As an adult citizen,

183
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:57,308
you should have understood
the need to interrogate you.

184
00:23:57,436 --> 00:24:01,475
Some people find it hard to distinguish
between private and business life.

185
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:03,564
Enjoy your meal.

186
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,691
Come on, girl!

187
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:16,743
You'll get hungry as you eat.

188
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,576
I'm not a monster.

189
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:23,288
Can I wait outside, please?

190
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:28,790
I can also lock you in a cell,
if you can't stand the sight of me.

191
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:31,758
Yes, please. I'd like it better.

192
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:37,716
Men have been sentenced
to eight years and more,

193
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:40,309
and are still appreciating my fairness.

194
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:42,804
But we can be different.
Pletzer!

195
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,522
Have her put in a cell.

196
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:57,277
That hurts!
- You don't say.

197
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:42,451
Looks like someone got sick.

198
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:46,375
You really don't want anything?

199
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:48,540
We can send out for something
and bill you for it.

200
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:52,256
I'm going out to the café anyway.

201
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:56,927
No sense of humour.

202
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:02,660
The people in contact with the fugitive

203
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:05,075
have all been checked out.

204
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:08,498
A bartender who served him a beer,

205
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:12,753
two girls he danced with.

206
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:16,215
We'll question them.
Hertha Scheumel and Claudia.

207
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:19,051
No, not the girls he danced with.

208
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,422
Did he talk to other girls, too?

209
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:27,393
A gas station attendant,
a cigarette store salesman,

210
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:31,097
a bank clerk who changed $ 700 for him,

211
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:33,144
probably from a bank robbery.

212
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:35,939
Numbers are being checked in Washington.

213
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:41,608
All of these have been positively
identified as chance meetings.

214
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:46,992
Not one word he exchanged with them
suggests anything like a code.

215
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,874
Yes, gentlemen.

216
00:27:51,962 --> 00:27:54,294
We are mystified.

217
00:27:56,967 --> 00:28:00,835
For 36 hours he was
under constant surveillance.

218
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:06,550
He took advantage
of the Carnival to get away.

219
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:10,144
Shouldn't we try to arrest this Sheik Karl

220
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:13,355
and investigate his highly obscure role?

221
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:17,981
After all, he's the one
who introduced him at the party.

222
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:23,741
Didn't it occur to you that Mr. Beizmenne
deliberately left him out?

223
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:27,240
He's one of our men.

224
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:31,036
Why wasn't Gotten arrested
if you had him under surveillance?

225
00:28:31,168 --> 00:28:33,580
All of the inspector Beizmennes moves

226
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:39,549
have been approved
by Internal Security in Bonn.

227
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:47,597
Just a moment.

228
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:53,846
You think she's innocent, Méding?

229
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,691
I see it the other way round.

230
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:01,028
I'd have taken her to my place.

231
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:06,864
The morning after, she'd tell me
the police were after her.

232
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:11,956
You'd turn her in.
- I probably would.

233
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:15,284
But I suppose
an average man would not.

234
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:20,039
Not everyone works for the police.

235
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:26,091
Anyone who thinks like that
doesn't belong in the force, Moding.

236
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:01,872
Mrs. Blum?

237
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:04,875
Mrs. Blum is in the county hospital.

238
00:30:05,012 --> 00:30:07,549
My name is Totges.
We're investigating for The Paper...

239
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:10,548
Her daughter Katharina...
she has no other relatives?

240
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:13,392
There's a younger brother, Kurt.
He is in jail.

241
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,727
Interesting. What for?

242
00:30:15,856 --> 00:30:18,314
I don't know.
- And the mother?

243
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:22,275
Not surprising,
with that little bastard.

244
00:30:22,404 --> 00:30:24,190
The husband came back
from the war a wreck,

245
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:27,281
just to die.
All the better for him.

246
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:32,153
Ask the reverend
what happened in the sacristy.

247
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:42,875
Schonni! Come on!

248
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:47,711
We still have some time left.

249
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:51,088
Sad... sad... sad...

250
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,432
Schonni!

251
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:04,477
A waitress may
look like a whore,

252
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,863
but she shouldn't be one.

253
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:15,617
I need that.
I have stomach trouble.

254
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,536
Soup.

255
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:21,585
You must eat soup, Schénni.

256
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:27,209
And Katharina Blum -
was she a whore?

257
00:31:27,344 --> 00:31:29,460
Her? No!

258
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:33,514
Stiff as a board.
You couldn't even pinch her ass.

259
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:36,679
Too square and too shy.

260
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:40,517
And then she fell
for the first one who laid her.

261
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:44,309
He married her. Brettloh.

262
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:47,944
This one. Third from the right.

263
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:53,489
He is - pardon the expression -
a genuine ass-kisser.

264
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,112
Wilhelm, you're going to be
in the papers!

265
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:03,752
Brettloh, Wilhelm.

266
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:13,504
Totges. We're from The Paper...
We're here on account of Katharina.

267
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,758
So you're the husband.
- I was.

268
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:20,511
I'm sure you can tell us a lot.

269
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:23,188
Dial.

270
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:29,987
Ladies, care for a hump with me?

271
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:33,574
Give me the editorial staff.

272
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:39,659
Looks like a sex desert here.
Perhaps we can get laid.

273
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:43,493
"Damning reputation
throughout the village.

274
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:46,791
The ex-husband, an honest working man,
Wilhelm Brettloh,

275
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:49,585
who divorced Blum
on grounds of desertion,

276
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:52,836
told us, hardly holding back his tears:

277
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:56,180
'l know at last
why she ran off on me.

278
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:58,845
Our humble happiness
wasn't enough for her.

279
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:02,140
She wanted to get up in the world,
and how could a modest working man

280
00:33:02,272 --> 00:33:04,388
ever get a Porsche?

281
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:08,062
Give my advice to the readers
of The Paper..."

282
00:33:08,195 --> 00:33:10,311
Just a minute! Coming!

283
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:15,699
"This is where false ideas
of Socialism are bound to lead.

284
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:19,866
I ask you and your readers: How does
a housekeeper come by that wealth?

285
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:23,116
It couldn't have been honestly."

286
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:41,429
Hello!

287
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:44,386
It happens.

288
00:33:45,482 --> 00:33:48,270
Sports.
- Thank you.

289
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:53,271
Tell me, would you say your housekeeper
was capable of committing a crime?

290
00:33:54,241 --> 00:33:56,903
What do you mean?

291
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,493
Everyone is capable
of committing a crime.

292
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:01,658
Interesting.
- So are you.

293
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:04,873
Aren't you the attorney Blorna?
- Yes.

294
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:07,459
I'm from the Austrian bureau
of The Paper...

295
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:11,581
Katharina Blum has been arrested
in that action against anarchists.

296
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:16,756
Katharina arrested? Impossible.

297
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:21,633
It's not that bad. They'll probably
let her run around for a while.

298
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:23,133
Who?
- Katharina.

299
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:26,513
Could you tell me more about her?
- It's a misunderstanding.

300
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:29,857
If you refuse, it'll look bad
and can be misinterpreted.

301
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:34,320
To keep silent in such a case
- this is a front-page story -

302
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:37,485
could only have bad implications.

303
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:40,860
Katharina is
a very bright, sensible girl.

304
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:45,206
Did you ever notice
her political opinions?

305
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:48,451
Why?
- Or do you yourself sympathize with...

306
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:52,501
That's enough. - Weren't you reluctant
to hire someone like her?

307
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:56,125
You hold files from the Listra AG
at your house.

308
00:34:56,261 --> 00:35:00,095
Couldn't she have a look at them?
- What are you suggesting?

309
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:03,341
According to our sources,
Dr. Straubleder is your partner.

310
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:08,892
No, I'm the counsel for the corporation
of which he is the main stockholder.

311
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:11,391
We are on vacation. Goodbye!

312
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:14,939
Thank you. That will do.

313
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:25,112
"I don't know" means
I'm not entitled to say anything.

314
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:27,330
I'm sorry.

315
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:51,731
We know the place is a hide-out,

316
00:35:52,025 --> 00:35:58,146
and Blum gave shelter
not only to Gotten but possibly to others.

317
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:02,399
Our staff has collected
valuable background material.

318
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:15,212
Did you know that the Blum girl
has had a gentleman friend for two years?

319
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:18,336
The nun!

320
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:27,929
No!
- Just an hour or so.

321
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:34,807
What kind of man is this Blorna?
Did you dig up anything?

322
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:36,399
Yes, another “coincidence":

323
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:40,863
Blorna happened to go on vacation,
when Gotten appeared.

324
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:43,774
His wife,

325
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:47,486
an architect.

326
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:50,910
In student days she was known as
"Trudy the Red."

327
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:55,332
Not for her opinions,
but for the colour of her hair.

328
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:03,009
Mrs. Blum, to interrogation.

329
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:24,022
Wait here a minute.

330
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:46,299
Mrs. Schwill!

331
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:11,574
Mr. Ruhwiedel.

332
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:15,574
Rather good-looking.
Obviously a high-class gentleman.

333
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:19,795
I wouldn't say that.
- I would.

334
00:38:57,502 --> 00:39:01,370
Might those visitors have been the men

335
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:05,374
who sometimes
drove you home after parties?

336
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:11,342
Is it forbidden to have gentlemen friends?

337
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:17,060
<i>Mrs. Blum, is it clear to you that this is
3 Very serious case</i>

338
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,266
with many implications

339
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:24,144
<i>that have kept the police
and D.As office busy for over a year?</i>

340
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:29,065
May I ask you: Are your gentlemen friends
- since you admit they exist ...

341
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:31,984
Yes.
- Good.

342
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:36,455
Are there many, or just one?

343
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:39,412
One.

344
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:43,253
So you've known Gotten for two years!

345
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,791
No.

346
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:50,718
I only met Ludwig yesterday.

347
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:53,464
Then who was it?
- Who was your gentleman friend?

348
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:57,176
He has nothing to do with Ludwig.

349
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:02,598
Get out of here!
- Unbelievable. They're still working.

350
00:40:07,864 --> 00:40:11,277
Do you recognize this ring?
- Yes.

351
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:14,322
Is it yours?
- Yes.

352
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:18,496
Do you know its value?
- It can't be much.

353
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:23,168
<i>We had it appraised by
ajeweller in the city, to be fair to you.</i>

354
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:26,664
This ring is worth
eight to ten thousand marks.

355
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:29,040
How much?
- Eight to ten thousand.

356
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,513
It was a gift.
- A gift? From whom? What for?

357
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:48,144
And this letter,
found in your bedside table,

358
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:52,777
was postmarked February 2 at 6 p.m.
in Dusseldorf

359
00:40:52,909 --> 00:40:56,652
with your address: Mrs. K. Blum,
Hochkeppelstr. 7, Cologne 1.

360
00:40:56,788 --> 00:40:59,325
Who sent it, if not Gotten?

361
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:02,575
He has nothing to do with Ludwig.

362
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:08,372
Nothing wrong in having a friend.

363
00:41:08,508 --> 00:41:12,251
You're divorced. You've no ties.

364
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:16,756
And it's no crime
that you take advantage of it.

365
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:20,225
Eight to ten thousand.

366
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:30,402
May I go back to my cell?

367
00:41:30,947 --> 00:41:33,188
I have nothing more to say.

368
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,858
Interrogation ended at 9:40 p.m.

369
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:40,741
Two cups of tea and a piece of cake
were brought to the detainee,

370
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:45,367
who accepted and paid for them.

371
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:49,538
Shouldn't we let her sleep at home?

372
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:53,713
I think it best to let her loose.
Perhaps he'll get in touch with her.

373
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:56,633
Shouldn't we lock her up
for her own safety?

374
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:59,756
You can sleep at home.
- We can't expose her to any danger.

375
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:03,135
In love, Moding?
- Mr. Beizmenne, Bonn!

376
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:05,854
You can take her home.

377
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:18,488
In case you're free tomorrow night.
- Thank you very much, Mr. D.A.

378
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:51,187
How did your tender Ludwig
leave the house?

379
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:53,560
All exits were watched.

380
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:57,906
You must have shown him a way out.
But I'll find him.

381
00:42:58,034 --> 00:43:01,243
And if there is any shooting,
it's obvious who'll get it. Good night!

382
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:56,099
Your name is Katharina?
- And yours?

383
00:44:57,612 --> 00:44:59,353
Ludwig.

384
00:45:01,866 --> 00:45:05,075
I haven't called a man
by his first name in ages.

385
00:45:07,747 --> 00:45:10,455
How long?
- Four years.

386
00:45:15,755 --> 00:45:17,666
Five.

387
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:24,552
Of course, there are fellow workers
I call by their first names.

388
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:28,506
I'm not a fellow worker.
- I know.

389
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,767
I'm so happy,

390
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:37,266
and a little scared.

391
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:41,228
Scared? Of what?

392
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:45,357
If I knew, I wouldn't be scared.

393
00:45:51,207 --> 00:45:54,575
I was married once,
and it didn't turn out well.

394
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:01,756
Let's leave soon.

395
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:46,213
Yes? Ludwig?

396
00:46:49,265 --> 00:46:51,097
Yes, this is Katharina Blum.

397
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:55,560
You fat bitch.
Is your pussy ready?

398
00:46:55,688 --> 00:47:00,057
Will you give me a blowjob?
Will you give me a hand job?

399
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:03,393
You pig.

400
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:33,677
"Must I force happiness upon you?

401
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:36,509
I'm warning you. Your neighbour."

402
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:09,735
Drunk.

403
00:49:15,828 --> 00:49:18,490
Are you feeling okay?

404
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:31,666
Were you following me in your car?

405
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:34,590
You won't lose us that easy.
Two beers.

406
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:38,840
I almost had an accident.

407
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:42,560
What are you scared of?
Aren't you innocent?

408
00:49:51,739 --> 00:49:55,027
FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 7, 1975

409
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:08,544
"Was her flat
the seat of conspiracy,

410
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:11,289
a mob hideout, a weapon cache?

411
00:50:11,884 --> 00:50:15,468
The ex-husband, an honest
working man, Wilhelm Brettloh,

412
00:50:15,596 --> 00:50:19,180
who divorced Blum
on grounds of desertion,

413
00:50:19,308 --> 00:50:22,096
could hardly hold back his tears:

414
00:50:22,228 --> 00:50:25,391
'l know at last
why she ran off on me.

415
00:50:25,523 --> 00:50:29,562
Our humble happiness
wasn't enough for her.

416
00:50:29,902 --> 00:50:31,609
She wanted to get up in the world,

417
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:36,277
and how could a candid, modest-working man
ever get a Porsche? '

418
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:38,483
As a warning he added:

419
00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:42,613
'This is where false ideas
of Socialism are bound to lead.

420
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:47,709
Now I know why I feared her radicalism
and her hatred of the Church. '

421
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:53,915
Her employer, the notorious
corporation lawyer Blorna,

422
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:56,418
when asked, told The Paper:

423
00:50:56,554 --> 00:50:59,137
'Katharina is ice-cold and calculating,

424
00:50:59,265 --> 00:51:01,882
and I hold her capable
of committing a crime."

425
00:51:02,268 --> 00:51:04,509
I know exactly what I told this guy.

426
00:51:05,396 --> 00:51:08,434
I said, she's bright and sensitive.

427
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:14,110
At best don't say a thing.
They can't force you.

428
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:17,568
I like you.

429
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:21,571
We like you very much.

430
00:51:22,663 --> 00:51:24,449
Yes.

431
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,087
She doesn't take
this garbage seriously!

432
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:36,457
Do you know what she said?

433
00:51:36,594 --> 00:51:40,462
"Unbelievable.
I know now how these pigs work."

434
00:51:40,598 --> 00:51:43,761
That doesn't sound like her.

435
00:51:50,316 --> 00:51:53,149
Do you know if she met him long ago?

436
00:51:53,277 --> 00:51:55,564
She'd never talk about it.

437
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:58,483
She says he's safe.

438
00:51:59,283 --> 00:52:02,150
She's laying herself open to prosecution.

439
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:05,077
That's what I told her.

440
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:10,791
We have to go back.

441
00:52:21,055 --> 00:52:24,093
Father Urbanus,
I'm sorry about the note,

442
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:28,138
but I liked the Karl Marx quote
so much that I had to keep it.

443
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:30,602
I'm not blaming you, my dear.

444
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:33,522
I know what situation you're in.

445
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:37,110
But that isn't why I sent for you.

446
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:40,730
We were afraid
you would be detained longer.

447
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:45,401
Katharina!

448
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:49,368
I thank you for coming.

449
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:00,841
I find it very foolish to summon me here.

450
00:53:00,969 --> 00:53:04,257
You hadn't guessed
that I wanted to see you? - No.

451
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:08,216
If you had, you wouldn't have come.

452
00:53:09,645 --> 00:53:12,387
I understand and admire you, Katharina.

453
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:17,184
I'm sorry that you got
into trouble because of me.

454
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:20,812
I'd like to thank you, Katharina.

455
00:53:22,116 --> 00:53:25,734
I've never doubted
your courage and sensitivity.

456
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:28,827
I'd like to help you.

457
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:32,907
Yes, I know.

458
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:37,457
I have been punished, too.

459
00:53:51,729 --> 00:53:53,766
I love you.

460
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:58,937
One word from you,
I'd turn myself in and confess:

461
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:01,811
"Look, it's me.

462
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:04,696
I bought her the ring.

463
00:54:04,825 --> 00:54:07,442
I'm the gentleman friend."

464
00:54:10,831 --> 00:54:14,745
You'd do that?
- I'd do anything to help you.

465
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:18,039
Anything ...

466
00:54:19,006 --> 00:54:20,917
that would help you.

467
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:23,875
It wouldn't help me.

468
00:54:24,887 --> 00:54:27,424
I often waited for you.

469
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:34,094
I never completely gave up hope
that you'd show up one day.

470
00:54:36,148 --> 00:54:38,389
Of your own choice.

471
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:43,732
But now I see: It was in vain.

472
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:50,868
So it's better
that I take back the key.

473
00:54:51,205 --> 00:54:53,162
You still have it?

474
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:55,998
It wasn't found in the search.

475
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,618
You forced me to take it.
I never wanted it.

476
00:54:58,754 --> 00:55:02,622
So you can give it back to me.
Wait!

477
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:07,752
You don't know
how much it means to me. Father Urbanus!

478
00:55:39,378 --> 00:55:42,541
Did you suspect
your daughter led a double life?

479
00:55:42,673 --> 00:55:43,834
Why?

480
00:55:43,966 --> 00:55:47,459
How does a mother feel,
faced with that?

481
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:50,632
It must have been
a great shock to you.

482
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:53,221
What for?

483
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:57,643
Of all people,
no one knows Katharina's character better.

484
00:55:58,981 --> 00:56:03,976
Mrs. Blum, how do you explain how your
daughter has come to this?

485
00:56:04,111 --> 00:56:07,229
Can you tell me?
- Why?

486
00:56:38,437 --> 00:56:41,771
What are you doing?
No visitors allowed!

487
00:56:41,899 --> 00:56:45,017
The woman needs rest.
- She will soon rest.

488
00:56:45,444 --> 00:56:47,936
Man, you can't do that.
- Shut up.

489
00:56:49,281 --> 00:56:54,401
Here comes K. Blum with her aunt,
Mrs. Woltersheim, into the Police station.

490
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:58,404
The heavily burdened young lady
seems very calm.

491
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:01,282
According to the D.A.'s press release,

492
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:07,414
Gdtten's hiding place still remains
unknown, in spite of information received.

493
00:57:15,933 --> 00:57:18,174
Mothers are giving, even sick ones.

494
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:21,302
How did you get to the mother?
- I'm an old pro.

495
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:24,229
"It had to come to this,"

496
00:57:24,358 --> 00:57:27,225
she whispered in a dying voice."
Did she really say that?

497
00:57:27,361 --> 00:57:30,854
We must help simple people
express themselves.

498
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:33,447
Mrs. Woltersheim
also has something to hide.

499
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:37,569
Her father, his name is Lumm,
she's a natural child, was a Communist.

500
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:42,870
In 1932, he emigrated to the Soviet Union,
where he disappeared.

501
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:45,618
Here are interesting xeroxes
our staff has provided.

502
00:57:45,754 --> 00:57:49,213
If he's in town, we can expect news
for the weekend edition.

503
00:57:49,341 --> 00:57:51,548
You won't have to wait long.

504
00:58:04,523 --> 00:58:10,485
I've got news on the Blum case.
"Backers in the GDR."

505
00:58:10,612 --> 00:58:13,320
"Well-informed police circles tell us

506
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:16,566
that Mrs. Woltersheim
has something to hide, as well.

507
00:58:16,702 --> 00:58:19,615
Documentary evidence shows

508
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:22,329
that her father, Peter Lumm,

509
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:27,076
emigrated to the USSR in '32,
where he disappeared.”

510
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:32,957
Mrs. Hedwig Plotten,
please report to department 3A!

511
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:37,920
Good morning. Did you sleep well?

512
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:42,182
Don't blame it on the police
if I'm a little rude.

513
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:45,428
I'm only a man,
and sometimes pretty blunt.

514
00:58:45,564 --> 00:58:48,306
We realize you must investigate
Katharina's role, but...

515
00:58:48,442 --> 00:58:50,683
Mrs. Woltersheim?
- Yes.

516
00:58:50,819 --> 00:58:52,901
Please come in.

517
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:59,234
I wonder if you have a right
to destroy a human being this way.

518
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:04,455
I don't mean just you,
but the handling of The Paper.

519
00:59:04,583 --> 00:59:08,417
Woltersheim. I've known Katharina
since she was born.

520
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:11,795
I see the disease and damage in her.

521
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:13,789
Because of The Paper?
- Yes.

522
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:15,916
That's not our concern.

523
00:59:16,053 --> 00:59:19,341
Anyway, freedom of the press
cannot be dealt with lightly.

524
00:59:19,473 --> 00:59:21,931
<i>But freedom and dignity
of 2 man can be.</i>

525
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:25,058
If you avoid bad company,

526
00:59:25,187 --> 00:59:28,145
you don't give the press
the wrong opportunities.

527
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:31,891
I won't take that kind of lesson,
especially from a young man.

528
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:35,482
My colleague's age means nothing.

529
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:40,074
However, his position as D.A.
means a lot.

530
00:59:40,744 --> 00:59:45,614
In any event, I don't ask my guests
to produce a police record.

531
00:59:47,042 --> 00:59:50,205
Your mother lives in East Germany

532
00:59:50,337 --> 00:59:52,453
and by her own choice.

533
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:56,757
She seems to prefer their system.

534
00:59:56,885 --> 01:00:00,173
Do many of your guests
think the same way?

535
01:00:01,056 --> 01:00:04,469
Do I have to supply you
with their political profile?

536
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:07,768
What are you investigating exactly?

537
01:00:07,896 --> 01:00:13,016
Let the state representative decide
what are the important questions.

538
01:00:24,538 --> 01:00:26,404
Mrs. Woltersheim!

539
01:00:32,212 --> 01:00:35,830
Is Katharina Blum's gentleman friend

540
01:00:35,966 --> 01:00:39,049
- let's leave aside whether
there's one or many of them -

541
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:41,339
among your guests, too?

542
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:44,884
Absolutely not.
Anyway, there's only one person,

543
01:00:45,016 --> 01:00:47,678
and the affair is in very bad taste.

544
01:00:47,811 --> 01:00:50,849
By “bad taste", I don't mean
Katharina, but the visitor.

545
01:00:50,981 --> 01:00:53,348
And who is this visitor?

546
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:56,566
Since Katharina didn't say,
I won't either.

547
01:00:56,695 --> 01:00:59,027
Do you know him personally?
- No.

548
01:00:59,573 --> 01:01:04,363
But you claim to know
all the details of Mrs. Blum's life.

549
01:01:06,413 --> 01:01:08,745
Did you know that,

550
01:01:08,874 --> 01:01:13,789
over the past few years, your Katharina
has travelled over 50.000 miles

551
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:17,129
all over Germany,
destination unknown?

552
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:22,437
Don't you feel well?

553
01:02:28,161 --> 01:02:29,947
Here.

554
01:02:32,457 --> 01:02:34,664
I went through the archive again,

555
01:02:34,793 --> 01:02:38,127
and I've picked out
some more clippings.

556
01:02:38,255 --> 01:02:42,544
Here, for instance,
they just mention a "Katharina B.".

557
01:02:42,676 --> 01:02:44,667
No picture.

558
01:02:44,803 --> 01:02:47,465
How do they know all that?

559
01:02:47,806 --> 01:02:52,141
The value of the ring,
all those lies about gentlemen friends?

560
01:02:55,272 --> 01:02:57,354
That's The Paper.

561
01:02:59,693 --> 01:03:04,028
Is the state unable to protect you
against this garbage?

562
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:09,362
Not everybody reads The Paper.

563
01:03:15,125 --> 01:03:17,457
All the people I know read The Paper.

564
01:03:30,974 --> 01:03:33,386
Have some tea?
- Please.

565
01:03:36,896 --> 01:03:41,265
Tip me off. If she's released. She's what
you're always looking for and never find.

566
01:03:41,401 --> 01:03:43,187
Areal gem.

567
01:03:46,364 --> 01:03:48,480
Well.

568
01:03:51,953 --> 01:03:54,035
How's Ludwig?

569
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:58,374
I'm not expecting you
to tell me where he is.

570
01:03:59,044 --> 01:04:01,627
It wouldn't fit into your character.

571
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:04,621
Let's forget what you've done.

572
01:04:04,758 --> 01:04:08,046
Let's assume you don't belong
to Gétten's gang.

573
01:04:08,178 --> 01:04:11,341
Personally, I don't believe that you do.

574
01:04:11,473 --> 01:04:17,970
Let's imagine Katharina Blum,
domestic help, above all suspicion.

575
01:04:19,439 --> 01:04:22,022
How much do you earn?

576
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:25,608
1.200 marks at Blorna's.

577
01:04:26,321 --> 01:04:30,861
With extra income I make
1.800 to 2.000 marks.

578
01:04:31,201 --> 01:04:33,488
What extra income?

579
01:04:34,037 --> 01:04:36,699
I said all that yesterday.
- That's the point.

580
01:04:36,831 --> 01:04:40,620
We don't understand how, with this income

581
01:04:40,752 --> 01:04:43,995
- more or less your salary, Moding -

582
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:49,751
how can you afford to buy a flat
worth 110.000 marks.

583
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:53,504
Don't you have any other earnings

584
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:57,304
or should we admit
the loot of Gotten's robberies

585
01:04:57,435 --> 01:04:59,221
fills the hole in your budget?

586
01:04:59,354 --> 01:05:03,143
I made a down payment for the flat:
7.000 marks. From my savings.

587
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:06,392
The Blorna's vouched for a 30.000 loan.

588
01:05:06,986 --> 01:05:10,650
My monthly expenses, including
interest, are about 1.100 marks.

589
01:05:10,782 --> 01:05:13,274
We just want to know
how you make it.

590
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:17,779
Perhaps we can learn
how to get to own an apartment.

591
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:21,239
1.100 per month.

592
01:05:21,376 --> 01:05:23,788
Our accountant has established

593
01:05:24,504 --> 01:05:28,919
that we should add
another 150 per month

594
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:32,793
that you send to your mother.

595
01:05:33,638 --> 01:05:36,801
Regular payments to a company

596
01:05:37,183 --> 01:05:39,925
to take care of your father's grave.
- Yes, twelve marks.

597
01:05:40,061 --> 01:05:44,305
Then something to your brother
who is serving time.

598
01:05:47,277 --> 01:05:52,113
I send him 10 to 20 marks
for cigarettes and coffee.

599
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:55,278
He needs them.

600
01:05:55,410 --> 01:05:58,448
Don't you spend anything on clothes?

601
01:05:58,580 --> 01:06:02,369
You don't always dress
as economically as you did yesterday.

602
01:06:07,922 --> 01:06:11,790
I fix up things
that Mrs. Blorna gives me.

603
01:06:13,011 --> 01:06:16,174
With this, I need your help.

604
01:06:19,517 --> 01:06:23,556
I wonder where
these gas bills come from.

605
01:06:26,149 --> 01:06:30,234
I drive to Blorna's every morning.
I drive back in the evening.

606
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:33,402
I do my errands on foot.

607
01:06:34,616 --> 01:06:36,732
We've measured the distance.

608
01:06:38,745 --> 01:06:41,157
The round trip is six kilometres.

609
01:06:44,209 --> 01:06:46,576
In the evening,
I work at Mr. Hiepertz'.

610
01:06:46,711 --> 01:06:50,204
Eight kilometres to the Hiepertz
home and back.

611
01:06:50,798 --> 01:06:54,792
From time to time, I visit my aunt.
- 4 Kilometres.

612
01:06:58,723 --> 01:07:02,011
On weekends, I go to a caterer's

613
01:07:02,977 --> 01:07:05,309
or I help out as a waitress

614
01:07:05,438 --> 01:07:08,351
at receptions, parties or weddings.

615
01:07:08,483 --> 01:07:13,102
Often, they're out of town.
- Could we say about 30 a week?

616
01:07:14,405 --> 01:07:17,147
A little less.
- 30.

617
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:26,956
That comes to 8.000 a year.

618
01:07:29,546 --> 01:07:32,880
You own a Volkswagen,
which you bought second-hand,

619
01:07:33,007 --> 01:07:36,750
according to the contract,
from a Mr. Klommer,

620
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:41,380
with a mileage of 56.000.

621
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:47,720
If we add 6 times 8.000,

622
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:53,480
it should come to 104.000.

623
01:07:57,115 --> 01:08:01,860
But in fact it shows 162.000.

624
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:05,696
Now and then she visits
her mother in Gemmelsbroich.

625
01:08:05,832 --> 01:08:11,248
50.000 still remain unaccounted.

626
01:08:11,379 --> 01:08:14,246
We have the gas bills.

627
01:08:15,216 --> 01:08:17,958
Where did you drive to so often?

628
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:20,836
What were you spying on?

629
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:25,307
Whom did you meet and where?

630
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:49,831
That's right.
I just added it up in my mind.

631
01:08:52,295 --> 01:08:54,753
I never gave a thought

632
01:08:55,923 --> 01:08:58,631
about those expenses.

633
01:09:02,305 --> 01:09:05,969
After work,

634
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:09,801
I often go for a drive.

635
01:09:09,937 --> 01:09:12,975
Mostly when it rains

636
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:15,766
and when I'm alone.

637
01:09:17,779 --> 01:09:21,238
Sometimes I'm home at 5
with nothing to do.

638
01:09:21,866 --> 01:09:24,528
I know so many women

639
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:28,495
who get drunk alone
in front of their TV.

640
01:09:34,128 --> 01:09:36,210
That scares me.

641
01:10:01,322 --> 01:10:03,529
Goodbye.
- Bye.

642
01:10:23,302 --> 01:10:26,340
"Sick mother collapses.

643
01:10:26,472 --> 01:10:30,761
What is Blum hiding?
Are our interrogation methods too gentle?

644
01:10:31,185 --> 01:10:35,144
Our correspondent managed
to find Blum's sick mother.

645
01:10:35,273 --> 01:10:39,938
She complained bitterly that her daughter
hadn't visited her for so long.

646
01:10:40,737 --> 01:10:43,445
Truth didn't catch her by surprise.

647
01:10:43,573 --> 01:10:45,905
"It had to come to this,

648
01:10:46,033 --> 01:10:48,525
she whispered in a dying voice."

649
01:10:52,331 --> 01:10:54,618
Nobody is allowed near her!

650
01:11:06,721 --> 01:11:08,507
Hello.

651
01:11:09,182 --> 01:11:13,972
You filthy pig.
You filthy, cowardly pig!

652
01:11:33,039 --> 01:11:37,533
Just let me throw that crap away.
- No, I'll read it.

653
01:11:52,642 --> 01:11:55,134
No news from him.

654
01:12:00,858 --> 01:12:03,395
"A good fuck is half the battle."

655
01:12:03,736 --> 01:12:06,228
"This is rather prickly."

656
01:12:16,541 --> 01:12:20,330
"Where Stalin didn't succeed,
you won't either."

657
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:24,629
"Learn to pray again."

658
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:31,090
"I'm the best lay. I'll will ..."

659
01:12:37,270 --> 01:12:39,807
COMMIE'S WHORE

660
01:12:44,068 --> 01:12:46,400
Don't take it seriously.

661
01:12:47,488 --> 01:12:49,946
I'll get rid of all this filth.

662
01:12:54,745 --> 01:12:57,157
Nice and cosy again here.

663
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:02,223
Now you go to sleep.

664
01:14:07,234 --> 01:14:10,522
Yes, I'll go home.
- Why don't you stay here?

665
01:14:14,033 --> 01:14:17,367
Good night.
- Good night.

666
01:15:12,967 --> 01:15:15,379
Is that you?

667
01:15:16,053 --> 01:15:19,262
Did you find it?
Are you all right?

668
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:23,971
Is there anything to eat?

669
01:15:35,239 --> 01:15:39,608
Don't worry.
They're leaving me alone.

670
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:45,993
I know,
but I had to hear your voice.

671
01:15:46,459 --> 01:15:48,075
You ...

672
01:15:50,629 --> 01:15:52,745
I like you so much.

673
01:15:52,882 --> 01:15:55,874
I'd like to be near you.

674
01:15:57,887 --> 01:16:01,721
Last night, I almost was on my way to you.

675
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:08,098
Don't call anymore. I'll call you.

676
01:16:10,024 --> 01:16:13,312
You told me not to speak of love.

677
01:16:14,361 --> 01:16:18,696
But [ still want to tell you
that I'm very fond of you.

678
01:16:22,870 --> 01:16:26,613
Me too ... very much.

679
01:17:26,809 --> 01:17:30,598
SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 8, 1975

680
01:17:53,294 --> 01:17:55,376
This bullshit,

681
01:17:56,463 --> 01:18:00,252
following you everywhere.

682
01:18:00,384 --> 01:18:03,126
I'll throw a bomb in their office.

683
01:18:30,164 --> 01:18:32,280
Is Alfred awake?

684
01:18:38,255 --> 01:18:41,373
I have to speak to you
about Katharina.

685
01:18:41,508 --> 01:18:44,125
Did you come back because of her?

686
01:18:44,261 --> 01:18:46,127
You should be careful.

687
01:18:46,263 --> 01:18:50,382
This Gotten belongs to a gang
of deserters and objectors.

688
01:18:50,517 --> 01:18:52,383
They are undermining
our domestic security.

689
01:18:52,519 --> 01:18:54,681
You sound like The Paper...

690
01:18:55,314 --> 01:18:57,681
What's this got to do
with Katharina?

691
01:18:57,816 --> 01:19:00,183
Haven't you read this crap?

692
01:19:00,319 --> 01:19:02,902
The worst slanders
against Trude and me!

693
01:19:03,030 --> 01:19:06,694
Did you come here
to discuss the yellow press?

694
01:19:06,825 --> 01:19:09,487
Don't you want to come in?

695
01:19:09,870 --> 01:19:12,157
You can throw a libel action
against The Paper.

696
01:19:12,289 --> 01:19:14,451
How could they get all that information

697
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:16,244
if it wasn't from you?

698
01:19:16,377 --> 01:19:19,915
This is not the time or the place
for your accusations.

699
01:19:20,047 --> 01:19:23,665
Are you under surveillance too?
- They're here to protect me.

700
01:19:24,510 --> 01:19:28,674
I'll file an inquest to see
if you collaborate with The Paper.

701
01:19:28,806 --> 01:19:30,888
Do as you want.

702
01:19:31,267 --> 01:19:33,258
Five days a week I work on radicals.

703
01:19:33,394 --> 01:19:35,726
I want to have the weekend off.

704
01:19:50,911 --> 01:19:53,403
What are you doing?
- What do you want?

705
01:19:53,539 --> 01:19:56,452
I'm with The Press.
- Who are you?

706
01:19:56,583 --> 01:19:58,620
Move it.

707
01:19:58,752 --> 01:20:05,294
Leave us alone or I'll whack you
in the face! Go away!

708
01:20:06,552 --> 01:20:10,170
I recognized you right away.
You're the broad's boss.

709
01:20:10,306 --> 01:20:13,674
And this is the house
with the swimming pool.

710
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:28,521
The coffee is very weak.

711
01:20:30,743 --> 01:20:34,577
Not like Katharina's.
- Cut it out.

712
01:20:34,705 --> 01:20:37,914
I'm not blaming you.
- You couldn't if you wanted to.

713
01:20:38,625 --> 01:20:41,492
With Katharina I could never ...
- Never do what?

714
01:20:43,213 --> 01:20:45,580
Take her in my arms.

715
01:20:46,175 --> 01:20:48,667
Not on your account.
- Thanks.

716
01:20:48,802 --> 01:20:51,715
You know what I mean.

717
01:20:51,847 --> 01:20:54,214
On account of her.

718
01:20:55,392 --> 01:20:58,976
She's so damned vulnerable.

719
01:21:00,189 --> 01:21:04,729
I don't think Alois noticed that.
- What's Alois got to do with it?

720
01:21:05,277 --> 01:21:09,020
Didn't it occur to you
that he's the gentleman friend?

721
01:21:12,868 --> 01:21:15,326
He thinks he's irresistible.

722
01:21:16,038 --> 01:21:18,279
I know that from experience.

723
01:21:19,208 --> 01:21:21,745
If it turns out it was Alois,

724
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:24,244
I'll punch him in the jaw.

725
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:27,042
Help yourself.
He just drove up.

726
01:21:43,148 --> 01:21:45,264
Come in.

727
01:21:46,610 --> 01:21:49,477
Good morning, Trude.
- Hello, gentleman friend!

728
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:52,731
I suppose Trude was right.

729
01:21:52,866 --> 01:21:54,732
I'm not sure
that's very good taste.

730
01:21:54,868 --> 01:21:58,406
Good taste would be to be
your wife's gentleman friend.

731
01:21:58,539 --> 01:22:01,201
The heating isn't on yet.

732
01:22:04,795 --> 01:22:08,038
Do everything you can
to find Katharina.

733
01:22:13,846 --> 01:22:16,679
I'm sorry you couldn't
get here before.

734
01:22:16,807 --> 01:22:19,765
I can't do anything about The Paper.
- Lading is in charge of that.

735
01:22:19,893 --> 01:22:22,134
I don't want my name to appear.

736
01:22:22,271 --> 01:22:24,478
Didn't you speak to Luding?

737
01:22:24,606 --> 01:22:28,725
You don't seem to be in the picture.
- I've no idea.

738
01:22:28,861 --> 01:22:32,900
That's weird, considering
I happen to be your client.

739
01:22:33,657 --> 01:22:36,319
Why didn't you come by plane?
- Because of the fog.

740
01:22:37,536 --> 01:22:40,995
So you don't know where she is?
- No.

741
01:22:42,916 --> 01:22:44,702
Do you?

742
01:22:45,669 --> 01:22:51,164
Katharina called Totges an hour ago
to offer him an exclusive interview.

743
01:22:51,717 --> 01:22:54,209
So what? Lading is controlling The Paper.

744
01:22:54,344 --> 01:22:57,427
There are other papers
besides The Paper.

745
01:22:57,973 --> 01:23:01,682
Totges can sell his articles
through patsies.

746
01:23:01,810 --> 01:23:03,892
I have nothing
against making headlines,

747
01:23:04,021 --> 01:23:06,934
except in connection
with anarchists.

748
01:23:07,065 --> 01:23:10,774
Why didn't you think of that
before your "visits"?

749
01:23:14,573 --> 01:23:19,283
An affair might at worst bring me
into trouble at home, not in public.

750
01:23:20,162 --> 01:23:22,620
We do live in a free country.

751
01:23:27,628 --> 01:23:29,585
Hubert.

752
01:23:31,423 --> 01:23:34,165
Talk her out of this interview.

753
01:23:36,011 --> 01:23:41,131
The worst hasn't come out yet
in the interrogations or in the press.

754
01:23:44,561 --> 01:23:48,054
Six months ago,
I made Katharina

755
01:23:49,107 --> 01:23:54,398
take the key to our place in the country.

756
01:23:57,199 --> 01:24:02,114
Sentimentality, I guess.

757
01:24:02,246 --> 01:24:05,079
I do love the girl.

758
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:09,333
But you won't help her against The Paper.
- You can't help her.

759
01:24:09,545 --> 01:24:12,628
You can help me.
She won't let you help her!

760
01:24:16,093 --> 01:24:18,710
God damn it, Hubert.

761
01:24:19,596 --> 01:24:21,963
You still don't understand.

762
01:24:24,309 --> 01:24:27,518
I'm sure she gave the key to Gotten

763
01:24:28,564 --> 01:24:31,431
and he's hiding at my place now.

764
01:24:33,443 --> 01:24:36,310
It's a good hideout.

765
01:24:38,865 --> 01:24:41,323
Why don't you call the police?

766
01:24:44,538 --> 01:24:47,371
An anarchist in my house!

767
01:24:48,417 --> 01:24:50,374
He must go away.

768
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:55,333
You could drive out there as my lawyer.
- Me? - Yes.

769
01:24:55,841 --> 01:24:58,173
To see if the snow drops are out?

770
01:24:58,302 --> 01:25:00,760
Do you really mean that?

771
01:25:00,887 --> 01:25:04,846
These Paper-bastards must be
watching me every minute.

772
01:25:06,226 --> 01:25:10,140
If my name is printed
in connection with this gang,

773
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:12,388
I'm through.

774
01:25:20,157 --> 01:25:22,444
Just out of the feeling

775
01:25:22,576 --> 01:25:24,783
you shouldn't get
too involved for Katharina.

776
01:25:24,911 --> 01:25:28,495
I'm not saying that for me, but for you.

777
01:25:28,624 --> 01:25:32,083
Sorry, Alois.
- Then we'll have to part company.

778
01:25:34,171 --> 01:25:38,711
Two picture frames with portraits,
a pair of health shoes,

779
01:25:40,093 --> 01:25:43,006
toilet articles in a plastic bag.

780
01:25:43,138 --> 01:25:46,756
Clothes are in the suitcase
with an inventory.

781
01:25:47,184 --> 01:25:49,391
Valuables:
Two wedding rings,

782
01:25:49,728 --> 01:25:53,141
a pin, and 32.50 marks in cash.

783
01:25:56,276 --> 01:25:59,064
Do you like it?

784
01:26:01,782 --> 01:26:03,693
Thank you.

785
01:26:04,576 --> 01:26:08,194
If Totges actually was in her room,

786
01:26:09,164 --> 01:26:11,155
I'll sue him.

787
01:26:12,125 --> 01:26:16,995
But I think it's impossible
that he had the nerve to do it.

788
01:26:18,131 --> 01:26:20,338
I'll go to court.

789
01:26:20,467 --> 01:26:22,879
I'll notify the Medical Association.

790
01:26:24,638 --> 01:26:28,006
We can't prove it had a harmful effect,
but we can't exclude it either.

791
01:26:28,141 --> 01:26:30,257
The operation had been successful,

792
01:26:30,394 --> 01:26:32,931
and your mother
was on the way to recovery.

793
01:26:33,313 --> 01:26:36,180
These people are murderers.
All of them.

794
01:26:36,983 --> 01:26:40,897
It's their very business to rob
innocent people of their honour,

795
01:26:41,488 --> 01:26:43,604
often to take their lives.

796
01:26:43,740 --> 01:26:46,323
Otherwise nobody would buy
their papers.

797
01:26:46,451 --> 01:26:48,613
Are you a Marxist?

798
01:26:57,796 --> 01:27:01,460
Just @ moment, please.
Your mother is being prepared.

799
01:27:01,591 --> 01:27:03,923
I would like to be there.

800
01:27:09,891 --> 01:27:12,474
Maria and Teresa, our two helps.

801
01:27:12,602 --> 01:27:14,809
Are you her daughter?
- Yes.

802
01:27:15,147 --> 01:27:17,138
Thank you for everything.

803
01:29:06,842 --> 01:29:09,550
Attention! This is the police!

804
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:40,664
The villa's owner, a well-known
Executive and university professor,

805
01:29:40,792 --> 01:29:43,204
is also a major Party official.

806
01:29:43,336 --> 01:29:48,251
It is not clear yet how Gotten could have
broken into this well-protected place.

807
01:29:48,675 --> 01:29:50,916
The owner, Professor Straubleder,

808
01:29:51,052 --> 01:29:55,011
has gone into retreat
for the carnival period.

809
01:29:55,140 --> 01:30:00,601
The house is surrounded by hills,
as if by perfect watch towers.

810
01:30:01,187 --> 01:30:05,556
Special troops were landed
at night by choppers,

811
01:30:05,692 --> 01:30:08,559
out of earshot,
and went into action.

812
01:30:09,321 --> 01:30:12,734
We waited for Gotten
to make his contacts.

813
01:30:12,866 --> 01:30:16,905
It was essential to find out
whom he was trying to contact.

814
01:30:17,287 --> 01:30:20,746
Our success here has proven
that it was a risk worth taking.

815
01:30:20,874 --> 01:30:22,785
Excuse me.

816
01:30:56,618 --> 01:30:59,576
Where is Ludwig?
What happened?

817
01:30:59,704 --> 01:31:02,366
We've already removed him.
He's well.

818
01:31:02,958 --> 01:31:05,666
Just a bullet wound in the thigh.

819
01:31:05,794 --> 01:31:07,910
What are you doing here?

820
01:31:55,301 --> 01:31:58,794
All we know is he's a deserter
from the Bundeswehr.

821
01:32:00,015 --> 01:32:02,882
He damaged this blessed
institution materially,

822
01:32:03,852 --> 01:32:06,093
not only morally.

823
01:32:06,229 --> 01:32:08,061
He never robbed a bank.

824
01:32:08,189 --> 01:32:11,773
He helped himself to the pay
of two regiments.

825
01:32:11,901 --> 01:32:13,983
Actually, it's all my fault.

826
01:32:14,112 --> 01:32:18,948
This is the blueprint for the heating and
plumbing system of Katharina's building.

827
01:32:19,075 --> 01:32:21,157
It was on the wall in our bedroom.

828
01:32:21,286 --> 01:32:25,905
It fascinated Katharina. I told her
exactly how high the passages are,

829
01:32:26,458 --> 01:32:29,621
where you can stand up straight,
where you have to duck

830
01:32:30,045 --> 01:32:32,787
in order to fix pipes or wires.

831
01:32:33,506 --> 01:32:36,214
Katharina, will you sit down?

832
01:32:37,594 --> 01:32:40,211
Today, we are going to spoil you.

833
01:32:46,269 --> 01:32:50,228
Without minimizing anything,
what exactly happened?

834
01:32:51,691 --> 01:32:54,979
You've been interrogated.
So have we all.

835
01:32:55,111 --> 01:32:58,354
The Paper smeared the usual crap on us.

836
01:32:58,782 --> 01:33:01,194
They only spared me,

837
01:33:01,326 --> 01:33:04,364
perhaps just because
I'm an old Nazi.

838
01:33:08,166 --> 01:33:11,534
You can stay at my place
if you won't go home.

839
01:33:11,669 --> 01:33:13,956
Here's my key.

840
01:33:14,089 --> 01:33:17,753
Thanks.
- I'm going to live with Else anyway.

841
01:33:21,679 --> 01:33:24,046
Life goes on.

842
01:33:34,818 --> 01:33:38,527
So, Katharina.
- How long will Ludwig get?

843
01:33:40,907 --> 01:33:45,117
With this hysteria,
I figure eight to ten years.

844
01:33:56,589 --> 01:34:01,379
You really love him?
- Yes.

845
01:34:05,014 --> 01:34:10,976
Why this interview,
now that it's all over? Let me cancel it.

846
01:34:11,104 --> 01:34:14,222
No, I want to see Totges.

847
01:34:14,649 --> 01:34:17,391
I want to know
what such a man looks like.

848
01:34:17,527 --> 01:34:20,895
You're not up to his tricks.
He'll fool you again.

849
01:34:21,030 --> 01:34:23,271
At least let me come along.

850
01:34:23,783 --> 01:34:25,990
I'd prefer to do it alone.

851
01:34:27,412 --> 01:34:31,076
SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 9, 1975

852
01:34:31,207 --> 01:34:37,374
GOTTEN CAUGHT - MOTHER DIES

853
01:34:38,131 --> 01:34:41,123
FIRST VICTIM
OF ANARCHIST PARAMOUR

854
01:35:08,203 --> 01:35:10,615
Hey, Katharina, is that you?

855
01:35:15,418 --> 01:35:17,659
We'll have a beer for breakfast.

856
01:35:18,713 --> 01:35:20,875
Look over there.
- It's the Blum girl.

857
01:35:21,007 --> 01:35:23,715
You're in The Paper. Everyday!

858
01:35:23,843 --> 01:35:26,710
We're saving the clippings.

859
01:35:36,314 --> 01:35:39,557
How about a quickie?

860
01:35:43,071 --> 01:35:45,278
She belongs in the gas chamber.

861
01:35:46,991 --> 01:35:49,028
Cheers!

862
01:37:20,251 --> 01:37:22,367
See, Blum,

863
01:37:22,837 --> 01:37:24,999
you're famous now.

864
01:37:26,007 --> 01:37:28,999
All that mail, even on Sunday!

865
01:37:30,094 --> 01:37:32,176
You can thank me for all that.

866
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:38,099
Special delivery, telegrams,

867
01:37:39,854 --> 01:37:41,515
by messenger.

868
01:37:43,232 --> 01:37:46,816
Just wait. You can make a lot of money
on your name.

869
01:37:46,944 --> 01:37:49,026
The story is still hot news,

870
01:37:49,155 --> 01:37:54,116
but we must keep plugging it
or people will forget about you.

871
01:37:54,243 --> 01:37:57,201
First an exclusive interview
for a weekly magazine.

872
01:37:57,330 --> 01:38:00,868
You're news.
You have to exploit that.

873
01:38:02,460 --> 01:38:03,996
Here.

874
01:38:06,047 --> 01:38:08,664
This is for the story on Straubleder.

875
01:38:10,385 --> 01:38:15,095
That business with the key.
We'll take care of the gentleman!

876
01:38:17,392 --> 01:38:19,554
We'll club him over the head.

877
01:38:20,395 --> 01:38:22,887
You have to be a bit more tolerant.

878
01:38:27,777 --> 01:38:32,522
You're not blaming me
for that Paper coverage?

879
01:38:32,657 --> 01:38:36,867
They treated you a little rough.
You're not mad at me?

880
01:38:38,246 --> 01:38:40,112
I'll get through it and so will you.

881
01:38:40,248 --> 01:38:42,535
I often get furious with the editors.

882
01:38:42,667 --> 01:38:46,251
I deliver first-rate copy
and they turn it into crap.

883
01:38:50,049 --> 01:38:53,292
I have a lot of respect for you.

884
01:38:56,889 --> 01:38:58,721
Really!

885
01:38:59,308 --> 01:39:01,766
What you"ve done ...
l take my hat off!

886
01:39:02,228 --> 01:39:04,469
Politically naive, of course.

887
01:39:04,605 --> 01:39:08,018
We should get to know
each other better.

888
01:39:09,068 --> 01:39:12,481
This interview is just the beginning.

889
01:39:13,448 --> 01:39:17,282
How about fucking for a start?

890
01:40:13,341 --> 01:40:19,087
Schooner's corpse has been found in the
woods. The Paper photographer.

891
01:40:19,722 --> 01:40:21,338
He was shot.

892
01:40:21,974 --> 01:40:24,261
Did you kill him too?

893
01:40:28,231 --> 01:40:31,064
Well, why not him too?

894
01:41:46,100 --> 01:41:49,934
EPILOGUE

895
01:42:48,329 --> 01:42:50,696
This is a very moving moment
at the cemetery.

896
01:42:51,957 --> 01:42:56,542
Many of our prominent citizens
are paying their last respects

897
01:42:56,671 --> 01:42:59,288
to the cold-blooded murdered journalist,
Mr. Totges.

898
01:42:59,423 --> 01:43:01,790
This is his mother, Mrs. Totges ...

899
01:43:03,886 --> 01:43:06,969
We recognize
Mr. and Mrs. Straubleder

900
01:43:07,098 --> 01:43:09,840
and the owner of The Paper,
Dr. Liding, who will give the eulogy.

901
01:43:24,824 --> 01:43:29,910
The shots that killed
Werner Totges

902
01:43:31,038 --> 01:43:33,245
didn't hit him alone.

903
01:43:33,958 --> 01:43:37,201
They were aimed
at Freedom of the Press,

904
01:43:38,254 --> 01:43:42,589
one of the most precious values
of our young Democracy.

905
01:43:44,009 --> 01:43:46,171
And these shots

906
01:43:46,554 --> 01:43:51,094
- for us who stand here
in grief and horror -

907
01:43:51,809 --> 01:43:54,050
they strike us.

908
01:43:55,771 --> 01:43:57,978
Just as they struck him.

909
01:43:59,024 --> 01:44:01,186
Who doesn't feel the wound?

910
01:44:01,318 --> 01:44:04,356
Who doesn't feel the sorrow

911
01:44:04,488 --> 01:44:08,402
above and beyond
one's personal concerns?

912
01:44:10,619 --> 01:44:13,953
Who doesn't feel the breath of terror,

913
01:44:16,292 --> 01:44:19,751
the savagery of anarchy,

914
01:44:20,421 --> 01:44:23,083
the violence which is undermining

915
01:44:23,215 --> 01:44:28,005
the foundations
of our liberal-democratic order,

916
01:44:30,055 --> 01:44:33,173
which we are so devoted to.

917
01:44:35,644 --> 01:44:39,729
Here, allegedly private motives

918
01:44:40,483 --> 01:44:43,396
have led to a political assassination,

919
01:44:44,195 --> 01:44:48,814
and we can say once more:
Stop it before it grows!

920
01:44:49,575 --> 01:44:51,486
Look out,

921
01:44:51,827 --> 01:44:55,946
for Freedom of the Press
is the core of everything:

922
01:44:56,957 --> 01:45:00,450
well-being, social progress,
democracy,

923
01:45:01,128 --> 01:45:03,119
pluralism,

924
01:45:04,590 --> 01:45:07,252
diversity of opinions.

925
01:45:09,261 --> 01:45:11,878
And whoever attacks The Paper

926
01:45:13,766 --> 01:45:16,224
attacks us all.

927
01:45:24,109 --> 01:45:27,977
TO OUR COLLEAGUE-
VICTIM OF HIS PROFESSION

928
01:45:28,113 --> 01:45:31,481
EDITORIAL DEPARTMENT "THE PAPER"
