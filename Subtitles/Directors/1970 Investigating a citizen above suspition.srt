00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:51,968
INVESTIGATION

3
00:00:52,053 --> 00:00:56,181
OF A CITIZEN ABOVE SUSPICION

4
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:37,062
Several scenes were filmed at the
Piazzale del Caravaggio

5
00:01:37,088 --> 00:01:38,748
administrative complex of
Beni Stabili, S.p.A.

6
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:54,572
Any similarity to real persons
or actual events is entirely coincidental.

7
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:38,867
JUSTICE

8
00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:42,871
SCIENCE

9
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:40,011
How are you going to kill me this time?

10
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:44,265
I'm going to slash your throat.

11
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:32,525
Hello?

12
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:36,779
Hello.
Police department?

13
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:40,241
What took you so long?
Are you sleeping or what?

14
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:42,702
There's been a crime.

15
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:46,163
Yes, a crime.

16
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:49,458
Via del Tempio 1.

17
00:11:50,294 --> 00:11:52,211
Not via del Tempo, idiot.

18
00:11:52,296 --> 00:11:55,548
Via del Tempio 1.

19
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:57,466
Augusta Terzi.

20
00:11:57,926 --> 00:11:59,635
Apartment number 1.

21
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:03,598
Did you write that down?
Repeat it to me.

22
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:06,494
After you.

23
00:13:07,371 --> 00:13:09,372
- After you.
- After you.

24
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,655
Wait a minute!

25
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,740
- Congratulations, Chief.
- Congratulations.

26
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:49,161
Congratulations, Chief.
We finally did it.

27
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:52,289
We couldn't have kept on
without a sense of direction.

28
00:13:52,374 --> 00:13:53,916
We needed a man like you.

29
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:58,796
The political situation is favorable.
I have lots of ideas.

30
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,090
Don't worry about anything.
See you later.

31
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:04,176
Piantone, bring me 15 glasses.

32
00:14:04,261 --> 00:14:06,929
- What's wrong?
- A murder, Chief.

33
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:12,143
- Via del Tempo 1.
- Tempio.

34
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,271
Mrs. Augusta Terzi.

35
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,650
- When did the call come in?
- Ten or 20 minutes ago.

36
00:14:19,735 --> 00:14:22,820
- Ten or 20?
- They didn't specify.

37
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:25,114
HOMICIDE DIVISION CHIEF

38
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:27,408
Precise.

39
00:14:27,993 --> 00:14:30,119
We must be precise.

40
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:34,415
We verified the name and address.
I'm going there now.

41
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:39,045
Your careless police work gives the suspects
time to come up with their alibis.

42
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:42,381
You'll realize that once I'm gone.

43
00:14:44,593 --> 00:14:47,178
"Officer Fires Shots."
Who was it?

44
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:50,639
OFFICER FIRES SHOTS:
WOUNDS FACTORY WORKER

45
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:52,683
We don't know him.

46
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:56,062
And, of course, he dropped
the gun and it went off.

47
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:58,481
That's the most likely story.

48
00:14:59,483 --> 00:15:01,358
Go to via del Tempio.

49
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:09,742
Congratulations.

50
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:44,401
Come on, cheer up!
What's with the sad faces?

51
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:48,239
Don't worry, ma'am.
Your son will get off with 10 years.

52
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:51,325
I've got nothing to do with it anymore.
I'm done here.

53
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:55,496
Mantiglia, Cascio,
Mangiaracine, Del Re, let's go!

54
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,915
All of you, let's go!

55
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:01,585
You're finally free of this leech.

56
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,129
Come on.

57
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:05,047
Panunzio!

58
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:09,426
Let's have Panunzio
break open a bottle for us.

59
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:13,430
- Here he is.
- My deepest congratulations, Chief.

60
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:15,307
Toruzzo!
You're coming with me.

61
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:19,270
- Mangani!
- You're coming with me, got it?

62
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:20,896
Congratulations.

63
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:24,817
It won't be easy for me
to fill your shoes.

64
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:29,530
Don't be ridiculous.
What are you talking about?

65
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:32,408
- And Panunzio? Where is he?
- Here.

66
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:34,702
There he is!

67
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:37,746
- Panunzio, eh?
- Should we go in?

68
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:41,333
So, did you get a confession
out of Proietti yet?

69
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:43,127
He still insists it was suicide.

70
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:46,839
Have a drink. The champagne
will help clear your mind.

71
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:49,091
My mind is already clear!

72
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:50,843
- I'm innocent.
- We understand.

73
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:53,721
She killed herself
just to get me in trouble.

74
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:54,805
- Yes!
- Yes.

75
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:57,099
Or maybe she lost her balance.

76
00:16:57,184 --> 00:16:59,143
She must have been dizzy.
I don't know!

77
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:00,769
You pushed her.

78
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:04,648
No, I was asleep,
just like I was when you found me.

79
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:07,443
I was asleep.
And besides, I'm a violent type.

80
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:11,572
I would've strangled that bitch!

81
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:15,618
Drink up, Mr. innocent.

82
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:17,203
Drink.

83
00:17:17,287 --> 00:17:19,288
Everybody's innocent here.

84
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:22,249
There's only one guilty party...

85
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:25,794
and that's me.

86
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:30,799
Quiet, please.

87
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:35,971
I'm not saying this to ingratiate
myself with a superior officer,

88
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:37,806
who is also a dear friend,

89
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:41,977
but nobody deserves
this promotion more than you.

90
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:46,065
In all these years,
we've investigated 102 murder cases,

91
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:48,317
and only 10 have gone unsolved.

92
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:50,569
I'm sure that, in this difficult time,

93
00:17:50,654 --> 00:17:56,575
the Political Division will become as efficient
as Homicide was under your command.

94
00:17:56,660 --> 00:18:00,788
I wish you as much success there
as you had here.

95
00:18:00,872 --> 00:18:06,961
I raise my glass to your health
and to your extraordinary career.

96
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:08,337
Cheers.

97
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:13,801
Enough ass-kissing.

98
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:18,681
- The carnival is over. Let's go.
- Via del Tempio 1 is a go!

99
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:21,058
Via del Tempio 1 is a go!

100
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:23,769
Mangani, Panunzio, let's go!

101
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:25,521
I'll meet you there.

102
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:51,380
Do you have a statement?

103
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:54,174
- It was her husband.
- Great!

104
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:05,728
What have you got?

105
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:08,605
Newspaper clippings of crime stories.

106
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:11,317
There's a photo of you too. Look.

107
00:19:18,116 --> 00:19:20,159
- Where is she?
- Over here.

108
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:30,044
Uncover her.

109
00:19:43,058 --> 00:19:45,392
Her jewelry box is empty.

110
00:19:46,478 --> 00:19:49,646
- And that?
- 300,000 lire in cash.

111
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:54,568
She was a real libertine,
like D'Annunzio.

112
00:19:56,196 --> 00:20:00,074
We haven't found
any undergarments in the house.

113
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:03,452
- Not even underwear.
- What a mess.

114
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:09,291
They were in bed, making love.

115
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,878
Any evidence of an orgasm?

116
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:15,047
Not from my initial examination.

117
00:20:16,508 --> 00:20:18,175
Cover her up.

118
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:22,429
Collect that bottle and that glass.

119
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:25,724
Did any of the tenants
see or hear anything?

120
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:27,976
We're getting their names.

121
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:30,187
Are you feeling okay?

122
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:34,900
- Who lives next door?
- A well-known surgeon.

123
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:38,487
An individual above suspicion.

124
00:20:44,035 --> 00:20:46,161
Whose name is the apartment in?

125
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:48,205
The victim's.

126
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:53,377
Who inherits everything?
The husband?

127
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:55,671
They've been separated for three years.

128
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:59,216
Find him. Question him.

129
00:21:00,844 --> 00:21:02,344
Look at this.

130
00:21:03,972 --> 00:21:07,349
The victim was posing
for fake crime scene photos.

131
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:12,688
There's a whole collection of them.

132
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:15,274
I think it's the work of an amateur,

133
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:17,234
and quite a childish one.

134
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:18,819
What do you think?

135
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:22,281
Lie down on the bed and turn over.

136
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:25,826
I'll show you how we found
that whore on Viale Coccia di Morto.

137
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,744
- Where?
- That's good.

138
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:29,872
- Now come with me.
- Where?

139
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:34,293
A German stewardess had sex with a Turk
during an intercontinental flight.

140
00:21:34,377 --> 00:21:38,464
We found her strangled to death
in the bathroom at Fiumicino airport.

141
00:21:38,548 --> 00:21:40,507
Stay still!

142
00:21:40,592 --> 00:21:44,052
- What do you want to do now?
- Let's do the young singer, the rising star.

143
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:46,638
Yes. Parioli, 1967.

144
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:49,808
A young rock-and-roll singer's
throat was cut.

145
00:21:49,893 --> 00:21:53,770
Her body was covered up
with albums of polyphonic religious music.

146
00:21:53,855 --> 00:21:55,981
An erotic and mystical crime.

147
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:58,400
The killer,
a former seminary student,

148
00:21:58,485 --> 00:22:00,736
was found some minutes later,

149
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:07,075
complacently listening to the voice
of his victim in front of a jukebox.

150
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:09,912
Not a seminary student, stupid.
He was an organist.

151
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:11,997
Don't move.

152
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:16,919
- Let's do the young revolutionary.
- Yes.

153
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:19,796
Young student protester. Trento.

154
00:22:19,881 --> 00:22:23,842
She was suffocated
by a tenured sociology professor

155
00:22:23,927 --> 00:22:25,886
with 10,000-lire bills.

156
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:27,930
She was raped after she was killed.

157
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:29,848
Hold still.

158
00:22:29,933 --> 00:22:31,767
Spread your legs. That's it.

159
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:33,602
Don't move.

160
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,481
There.

161
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:39,608
Doesn't it excite you
to find them like this?

162
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:44,446
Sometimes.
Once, a particular detail excited me.

163
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,907
A tool.

164
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,118
- What kind?
- No, I'm too embarrassed.

165
00:23:03,675 --> 00:23:05,300
Let me through.

166
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:19,481
- Chief.
- What is it?

167
00:23:19,983 --> 00:23:21,567
I think he's a complete idiot.

168
00:23:21,651 --> 00:23:23,235
- Who?
- The killer.

169
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:25,028
Why do you think that?

170
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:29,324
Not just stupid,
but also superficial and conceited.

171
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:33,620
He fakes a robbery by taking her jewelry
but leaves 300,000 lire in the dresser.

172
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:36,123
Then he gets dressed,
has a shower.

173
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:38,458
He dolls himself up,
uses the victim's French soap.

174
00:23:38,543 --> 00:23:40,085
- And?
- He puts his shoes on.

175
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:44,298
Then he tramps through her blood,
leaving footprints everywhere.

176
00:23:44,382 --> 00:23:47,509
Helpful for us,
but what an idiot.

177
00:23:49,012 --> 00:23:50,512
No?

178
00:23:51,472 --> 00:23:53,181
He's an idiot.

179
00:24:04,736 --> 00:24:08,822
Let's hope it was the husband.
You can wrap it up quickly.

180
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:25,107
- Well?
- Naked.

181
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:27,943
- Was she raped?
- No, she had consensual sex.

182
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:31,488
She was killed afterwards.
No signs of struggle in the apartment.

183
00:25:31,572 --> 00:25:34,241
Write this down. You breathe in
an atmosphere of sex, pleasure.

184
00:25:34,325 --> 00:25:37,953
It's morbid. it reeks of D'Annunzio.
There's blood everywhere.

185
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:40,288
Get out. I'm driving.

186
00:25:40,748 --> 00:25:43,083
Did she have a nice body?

187
00:25:43,376 --> 00:25:48,004
Skin like satin, like a true courtesan
of the Roman Empire.

188
00:25:48,089 --> 00:25:50,173
Here's something
for your left-wing readers.

189
00:25:50,258 --> 00:25:52,634
No undergarments
were found in the apartment.

190
00:25:53,136 --> 00:25:55,887
- A fetish?
- No. She just didn't wear them.

191
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:57,472
I have my headline.

192
00:25:57,557 --> 00:26:01,643
Do me a favor, Patané,
focus on the husband.

193
00:26:01,728 --> 00:26:03,353
Do me a favor.

194
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:34,903
Commissioner.

195
00:27:36,531 --> 00:27:38,740
You don't know me.

196
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:43,578
Am I speaking to the famous
and powerful Chief of Homicide?

197
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,997
No, you don't know me.

198
00:27:46,082 --> 00:27:47,916
You've never seen me before.

199
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,876
I don't hang out with cops.

200
00:27:50,962 --> 00:27:52,504
Who am I?

201
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:57,551
I could be a thief,
a maniac, a murderer,

202
00:27:57,635 --> 00:28:01,596
one of the 30 murderers
still wandering free in this city.

203
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:03,974
What's my name?

204
00:28:05,226 --> 00:28:07,352
You figure it out.
You're so smart.

205
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:10,689
You pose for photos and give interviews.

206
00:28:11,148 --> 00:28:13,984
By the way,
try losing some weight.

207
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:19,364
Chief, help!

208
00:28:20,408 --> 00:28:23,827
Someone's breaking into my house.
I can hear his footsteps.

209
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:27,038
They've been threatening me for months:
letters, anonymous calls.

210
00:28:27,123 --> 00:28:31,042
It's someone who wants
to possess me, rape me.

211
00:28:31,127 --> 00:28:33,879
He's here!
He has no pants on!

212
00:28:35,882 --> 00:28:37,674
How awful.

213
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:42,554
I'm all alone, naked.

214
00:28:43,097 --> 00:28:44,931
I'll be raped and killed.

215
00:28:45,308 --> 00:28:48,310
That's my fate. Help!

216
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:52,981
Always wearing black,
always in mourning.

217
00:28:54,692 --> 00:28:57,152
Don't kid yourself.

218
00:28:57,528 --> 00:28:59,070
You don't interest me physically.

219
00:28:59,155 --> 00:29:01,990
You're an average Italian.
You're too hairy.

220
00:29:02,325 --> 00:29:04,534
You probably sweat a lot.

221
00:29:04,994 --> 00:29:08,163
I'm sure you smell
like shoe polish, don't you?

222
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:11,291
All policemen do. Admit it.

223
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:15,503
A policeman is full of secrets,
like a priest.

224
00:29:16,047 --> 00:29:18,381
It's your mind that excites me.

225
00:29:18,466 --> 00:29:20,884
I really admire the police.

226
00:29:20,968 --> 00:29:23,762
I'd love to be a snitch.

227
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:27,307
What I wouldn't give
to be interrogated by you.

228
00:29:32,146 --> 00:29:34,731
Ask your fucking sister to do that!

229
00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:39,819
- Who is it?
- Police.

230
00:29:42,406 --> 00:29:46,660
Who else could it have been?
A thief or a cop.

231
00:29:46,744 --> 00:29:48,662
Who does this belong to?

232
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,705
A man.

233
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:54,709
Who are you?
What do you want?

234
00:29:55,378 --> 00:29:57,754
Why did you call me?

235
00:30:00,341 --> 00:30:01,925
Let's get one thing clear.

236
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:06,972
- I don't pay for my women.
- Nice.

237
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:16,231
You should have called
the vice squad, not Homicide.

238
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:19,567
Who do you think I am?

239
00:30:20,069 --> 00:30:21,903
What's your game?

240
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:24,739
Just having some fun.

241
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:29,327
How did you meet
all these millionaires?

242
00:30:29,996 --> 00:30:32,122
Did you call them too?

243
00:30:32,707 --> 00:30:34,499
You're good.

244
00:30:34,792 --> 00:30:37,252
Wow, you're quite a cop.

245
00:30:38,421 --> 00:30:40,296
But there's a mistake here.

246
00:30:41,257 --> 00:30:45,135
In '66, I was all alone,

247
00:30:45,928 --> 00:30:47,595
like a dog.

248
00:30:55,146 --> 00:30:56,771
On your feet!

249
00:30:58,649 --> 00:31:00,150
Toruzzo.

250
00:31:00,943 --> 00:31:02,527
How are you?

251
00:31:04,238 --> 00:31:05,405
- How are you?
- Good.

252
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:10,785
Gentlemen, I hope you appreciate
the novelty of this meeting.

253
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:13,955
It's American-style!

254
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:19,210
We don't have enough men
for all the work in front of us.

255
00:31:19,295 --> 00:31:22,213
- That's right!
- We need many more!

256
00:31:22,298 --> 00:31:23,840
Have a seat.

257
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:32,974
As of today, I've been made Chief
of the Political Division.

258
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:37,479
You all know that up until yesterday
I was catching murderers,

259
00:31:37,772 --> 00:31:39,939
and with a certain amount of success.

260
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:45,945
There's a reason why
they chose a man like me,

261
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:49,199
at a time like this,

262
00:31:49,283 --> 00:31:51,701
to direct the Political Division.

263
00:31:53,496 --> 00:31:55,830
The decision was made
for the following reason:

264
00:31:56,165 --> 00:31:59,751
The difference between common
and political felonies

265
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:03,213
is dwindling more and more each day.

266
00:32:03,297 --> 00:32:05,757
It has almost disappeared.

267
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:09,427
Memorize this rule:

268
00:32:09,512 --> 00:32:13,348
Inside every criminal,
an subversive may be hiding,

269
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:17,477
and inside every subversive,
a criminal may be hiding.

270
00:32:19,105 --> 00:32:21,606
In this city that has been
entrusted to our care,

271
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:25,693
subversives and criminals
have already spun their invisible web.

272
00:32:25,778 --> 00:32:28,363
It's up to us to tear it down.

273
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:34,369
What's the difference between
a gang of robbers assaulting a bank

274
00:32:34,787 --> 00:32:39,958
and organized, institutionalized,
legal subversion?

275
00:32:40,042 --> 00:32:41,543
There isn't any.

276
00:32:41,627 --> 00:32:46,131
They both have the same objective.
They just use different methods.

277
00:32:46,215 --> 00:32:50,051
Their objective is to overthrow
the current social order.

278
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:52,178
6,000 prostitutes on file.

279
00:32:52,263 --> 00:32:56,933
A 20% rise in strikes and sit-ins
in both public and private buildings.

280
00:32:57,476 --> 00:32:59,727
2,000 known whorehouses.

281
00:32:59,812 --> 00:33:03,022
In one year, 30 attempts to destroy
state property as an act of protest.

282
00:33:03,107 --> 00:33:04,941
200 rapes in one year.

283
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:08,945
50,000 high school students
demonstrating in the streets.

284
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:12,198
A 30% rise in bank robberies.

285
00:33:12,283 --> 00:33:15,285
10,000 new subversives on file.

286
00:33:15,369 --> 00:33:17,287
600 homosexuals on file.

287
00:33:17,371 --> 00:33:22,125
More than 70 subversive groups
operating outside the bounds of the law.

288
00:33:22,209 --> 00:33:26,504
A 50% rise in fraudulent bankruptcy
and protests of bills of exchange.

289
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:32,427
An indescribable number
of political magazines urging revolution.

290
00:33:33,721 --> 00:33:35,889
The exercise of freedom

291
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:40,935
is threatening our traditional
power structure from all sides,

292
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:43,354
our established authorities.

293
00:33:43,439 --> 00:33:49,110
The exercise of freedom makes
every citizen think he's a judge

294
00:33:49,195 --> 00:33:55,867
and prevents us from executing
our sacrosanct duties freely!

295
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:59,287
We are the protectors of the law,

296
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:04,626
and it should be immutable,
carved in stone.

297
00:34:09,465 --> 00:34:11,716
The populace lacks maturity.

298
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,052
The city is sick.

299
00:34:14,136 --> 00:34:18,223
Let others take up the task
of healing and educating.

300
00:34:18,307 --> 00:34:22,143
Our duty is to repress them!

301
00:34:22,686 --> 00:34:25,897
Repression is our vaccine!

302
00:34:26,482 --> 00:34:29,776
Repression is civilization!

303
00:34:30,778 --> 00:34:32,946
Well said, Chief.

304
00:34:33,614 --> 00:34:35,281
Bravo, Chief!

305
00:34:36,325 --> 00:34:39,786
No applause, please.
I barely did anything.

306
00:34:40,329 --> 00:34:41,788
A little restraint, please.

307
00:34:41,872 --> 00:34:44,457
Let's get back to work.

308
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:56,094
The Communists are in this section.

309
00:34:56,178 --> 00:35:00,056
Then come the partisans,
Trotskyites, Maoists and anarchists.

310
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,475
- And the political parties?
- Over here.

311
00:35:06,146 --> 00:35:07,981
Here we have the various
Catholic movements.

312
00:35:08,065 --> 00:35:12,068
In the back, the Social Democrats
up through the right-wing opposition parties.

313
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:16,531
With progress, obviously,
all of this will be destroyed,

314
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:19,200
and we'll gather everything
into two small rooms.

315
00:35:19,285 --> 00:35:21,077
This way, please.

316
00:35:22,246 --> 00:35:24,539
Canes, come here.

317
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:30,420
I'd like to take a peek
at my Homicide colleagues' files,

318
00:35:30,504 --> 00:35:32,213
as a joke.

319
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:39,637
For the past two weeks, we've been entering
the data from the archive's files in here.

320
00:35:39,722 --> 00:35:41,723
That's progress for you.

321
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:45,685
- Let's do a test.
- Let's.

322
00:35:46,353 --> 00:35:50,315
Imagine that the Terzi murder
was political in nature.

323
00:35:50,399 --> 00:35:52,608
- What's the address, exactly?
- Via del Tempio 1.

324
00:35:52,693 --> 00:35:54,319
- What zone?
- Downtown.

325
00:35:54,403 --> 00:35:55,862
We'll ask the computer

326
00:35:55,946 --> 00:36:00,450
if via del Tempio is home to any socially
or politically dangerous individuals.

327
00:36:03,912 --> 00:36:07,081
- How does it work?
- Like this.

328
00:36:10,336 --> 00:36:12,962
What's this?
America has arrived!

329
00:36:13,047 --> 00:36:14,922
It's revolutionary!

330
00:36:15,007 --> 00:36:17,592
One of our old acquaintances
lives at via del Tempio 1.

331
00:36:18,344 --> 00:36:22,513
A socially and politically
dangerous individual.

332
00:36:22,598 --> 00:36:24,349
- Pace, Antonio.
- Yes.

333
00:36:24,433 --> 00:36:28,353
Born in Ravenna, March 24, 1946.

334
00:36:28,437 --> 00:36:31,314
Chemistry student,
student council member.

335
00:36:31,398 --> 00:36:34,525
Subversive, hot-blooded,
fanatical, dangerous.

336
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:38,196
- Is his line tapped?
- Of course, Chief.

337
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:41,574
Since May 1968.

338
00:36:44,787 --> 00:36:47,080
The face of a criminal.

339
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:51,793
I'll put him away.

340
00:37:01,136 --> 00:37:02,637
Chief.

341
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:05,139
Please come in.

342
00:37:07,101 --> 00:37:08,684
Until next time.

343
00:37:10,312 --> 00:37:13,481
- Your Eminence.
- No, my son, better not.

344
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:28,079
- Would you like a cigar?
- Thank you.

345
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:29,497
Here.

346
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:31,332
Have a seat.

347
00:37:33,502 --> 00:37:35,962
So, are you satisfied?

348
00:37:36,046 --> 00:37:38,005
Well, you know, satisfied...

349
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:43,553
In 1917, the responsibility for Caporetto's
defeat fell on General Cadorna.

350
00:37:43,637 --> 00:37:46,264
This year's center-left party

351
00:37:46,348 --> 00:37:49,517
could become another Caporetto
for those in charge.

352
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:51,811
The country is tense.

353
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:55,481
I'd feel better if I had
a larger team to work with.

354
00:37:55,566 --> 00:38:00,945
I need 100 more men and more funding
to pay my informants better.

355
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:03,281
I'll discuss it with the minister.

356
00:38:03,365 --> 00:38:06,951
- I would like...
- Go on.

357
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:09,412
- I would really like to...
- Tell me.

358
00:38:09,496 --> 00:38:11,539
- Listen.
- Tell me.

359
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,624
To rent one...

360
00:38:13,709 --> 00:38:20,131
three apartments in a nice, quiet
neighborhood like Prati for my informants

361
00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:23,759
so I can establish a relationship
with them that's more...

362
00:38:23,844 --> 00:38:25,887
- More?
- Informative.

363
00:38:26,722 --> 00:38:28,389
All right.

364
00:38:28,891 --> 00:38:32,059
But officially,
I don't know anything about it.

365
00:38:33,896 --> 00:38:39,650
My office has prepared a new list
of 630 numbers to be tapped.

366
00:38:39,735 --> 00:38:43,905
I don't know if you think
we should request authorization.

367
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:46,407
- I don't know.
- You decide.

368
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:51,746
- Is that all?
- Oh, yes.

369
00:38:52,456 --> 00:38:55,166
That woman who was killed
three days ago...

370
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:59,504
- Who? Mrs. Terzi?
- Exactly. Augusta Terzi.

371
00:38:59,588 --> 00:39:01,631
Beautiful woman.

372
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:04,091
I saw the photos.

373
00:39:04,968 --> 00:39:08,095
I knew her.

374
00:39:09,223 --> 00:39:10,348
Yes.

375
00:39:10,432 --> 00:39:14,685
I had an affair with her.

376
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,440
How was it?

377
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:21,943
Good? How was it?

378
00:39:22,027 --> 00:39:23,611
Well, you know.

379
00:39:28,784 --> 00:39:32,995
I wanted to ask you
if you think it's necessary

380
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,706
to inform the investigators
about the situation?

381
00:39:35,791 --> 00:39:38,334
I really don't know.

382
00:39:39,628 --> 00:39:41,462
What do you think?

383
00:39:42,548 --> 00:39:43,548
Bye.

384
00:39:46,218 --> 00:39:47,802
- Bye.
- Bye.

385
00:39:50,389 --> 00:39:52,098
I really don't know.

386
00:39:52,933 --> 00:39:55,935
I think it was the husband.

387
00:40:15,998 --> 00:40:17,999
Send in Panunzio.

388
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:28,426
Morning, Chief.

389
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:34,348
I brought you a souvenir photo
of the glorious Homicide squad.

390
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,684
Sit down.

391
00:40:44,985 --> 00:40:47,361
Yes, I know.

392
00:40:47,696 --> 00:40:51,574
My cousin's a Communist
and secretary of a labor union.

393
00:40:51,658 --> 00:40:53,492
But what can I do?

394
00:40:53,577 --> 00:40:55,995
He never sets foot in my house.

395
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,623
Besides, I've never even seen him.

396
00:41:00,542 --> 00:41:03,127
Okay, to be honest, I do see him,

397
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:06,756
but once a year, at Christmas.

398
00:41:09,718 --> 00:41:14,055
Chief, I've only got two years left.

399
00:41:14,139 --> 00:41:16,265
Don't transfer me.

400
00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:18,809
I have two sons in university.

401
00:41:18,894 --> 00:41:22,063
I need to keep an eye on them,
in every respect.

402
00:41:24,024 --> 00:41:26,651
How's the Terzi case going?

403
00:41:27,527 --> 00:41:30,154
We have an interesting lead.

404
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:35,618
Underneath the victim's nail,
forensics found a blue silk thread

405
00:41:35,702 --> 00:41:38,162
that seems to have been ripped from a tie.

406
00:41:38,622 --> 00:41:42,166
- Wasn't the murderer naked?
- Yes.

407
00:41:44,753 --> 00:41:48,381
So you think he was naked,
but wearing a tie.

408
00:41:48,465 --> 00:41:51,926
You're right.
No one even thought of that.

409
00:41:54,096 --> 00:41:55,930
Panunzio.

410
00:42:11,321 --> 00:42:13,781
Are you interrogating her husband?

411
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:16,659
Yes, Chief.

412
00:42:16,743 --> 00:42:19,453
They've been questioning him
since last night.

413
00:42:20,497 --> 00:42:24,458
- Fingerprints?
- Nothing interesting.

414
00:42:24,543 --> 00:42:26,669
Only yours, Chief.

415
00:42:27,129 --> 00:42:28,713
Mine?

416
00:42:30,632 --> 00:42:32,383
Mine!

417
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:35,302
Yes, on a doorknob.

418
00:42:37,806 --> 00:42:41,726
And on a coffee cup, Chief.
You must have been sleepy.

419
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:43,269
This one was in the shower,

420
00:42:43,353 --> 00:42:46,439
but we all went in there,
even Mangani, remember?

421
00:42:46,523 --> 00:42:49,692
And also in the kitchen.

422
00:42:49,776 --> 00:42:52,653
There it is.
In the kitchen too.

423
00:42:52,738 --> 00:42:55,156
But we all went in there too.

424
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:59,493
You must have picked something up
distractedly, without taking precautions.

425
00:42:59,578 --> 00:43:01,704
And on the telephone too.
Where is it?

426
00:43:01,788 --> 00:43:03,956
Here. On the telephone.

427
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,834
No doubt you must have
made a call that night.

428
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:09,128
I remember it clearly.

429
00:43:09,212 --> 00:43:13,340
And then on a glass.
Here. A liquor glass.

430
00:43:13,675 --> 00:43:17,470
You didn't feel well that night.
Remember?

431
00:43:17,554 --> 00:43:21,265
You had a glass of Fernet.
I poured it myself, remember?

432
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:23,267
I wrote it down in my notes.

433
00:43:23,351 --> 00:43:24,852
Do you feel ill, Chief?

434
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:27,730
So, sir...
or should I say ma'am?

435
00:43:27,814 --> 00:43:30,983
Tell us when you first
became a homosexual!

436
00:43:31,067 --> 00:43:34,612
Was it before or after you
and Augusta Terzi were separated?

437
00:43:34,696 --> 00:43:36,197
Why'd your wife kick you out?

438
00:43:36,281 --> 00:43:40,075
Because he was throwing
his money out the window.

439
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,120
It wasn't that simple.
You can't put it that way!

440
00:43:43,205 --> 00:43:44,997
I loved her!

441
00:43:45,081 --> 00:43:46,957
Evening. Perfect timing.

442
00:43:47,042 --> 00:43:48,542
He's done for.

443
00:43:48,627 --> 00:43:51,796
Two or three more questions, my way,
and he'll break for sure.

444
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,756
Are you crying?

445
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:57,551
Have you made up your mind,
artist, hippie, queen of queers?

446
00:43:57,636 --> 00:44:00,221
- Are you going to talk?
- You'd better. We know everything.

447
00:44:00,305 --> 00:44:02,139
Of course, it's obvious.

448
00:44:02,224 --> 00:44:05,643
You're a queer. She was beautiful,
and you killed her.

449
00:44:05,727 --> 00:44:07,269
- That's what happened.
- That's not true!

450
00:44:07,354 --> 00:44:09,688
- Talk. Be a good boy.
- I want my lawyer!

451
00:44:09,773 --> 00:44:12,274
- We're not in America.
- I want my lawyer!

452
00:44:12,359 --> 00:44:14,902
As soon as the law changes,
I'll send him to you.

453
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:18,155
You're an artist, a sensitive type.

454
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,574
- Try to help us.
- Of course.

455
00:44:20,659 --> 00:44:24,036
Now he'll tell us the whole story, calmly.
Let's start from the beginning.

456
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:27,414
The Sunday that your wife,
Augusta Terzi, was killed,

457
00:44:27,499 --> 00:44:29,583
what time did you get back
from Fregene?

458
00:44:29,668 --> 00:44:32,294
- I already told you.
- Tell us again.

459
00:44:32,754 --> 00:44:34,380
- At 4:00.
- And then?

460
00:44:34,464 --> 00:44:38,133
I picked up my car
and headed out towards Rome.

461
00:44:39,553 --> 00:44:44,974
There was a traffic jam,
tons of people, thousands.

462
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:47,893
So strange.

463
00:44:48,562 --> 00:44:50,521
I know it seems unlikely, but...

464
00:44:51,106 --> 00:44:53,315
- He's a real faggot.
- The traffic jam is your alibi.

465
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,859
How convenient!

466
00:44:54,943 --> 00:44:57,695
I told you everything I know
about her, myself, everyone!

467
00:44:58,154 --> 00:44:59,989
Not everything.

468
00:45:00,782 --> 00:45:03,701
Or at least,
not of your own accord.

469
00:45:04,452 --> 00:45:07,621
You used your wife
to advance your own career!

470
00:45:07,706 --> 00:45:11,083
If your colleague hadn't told us,
you'd never have confessed that!

471
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:15,254
Want to see
if I can wake you up?

472
00:45:15,338 --> 00:45:17,840
Interrogate me.
Let's do something.

473
00:45:17,924 --> 00:45:19,550
Stop sleeping.

474
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:22,219
Leave me alone.

475
00:45:22,304 --> 00:45:24,471
I like it when you interrogate me.

476
00:45:24,973 --> 00:45:27,808
You're so suspicious.
It reminds me of my father.

477
00:45:27,893 --> 00:45:30,019
Come on, interrogate me.

478
00:45:30,103 --> 00:45:31,645
Interrogate me!

479
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:35,983
All right, first get off the bed.

480
00:45:36,067 --> 00:45:37,568
Get off the bed!

481
00:45:37,652 --> 00:45:40,070
Now get on your knees.
Straighten up!

482
00:45:41,156 --> 00:45:42,865
Straighten up!

483
00:45:54,252 --> 00:45:57,755
I get it.
The silence is intimidating.

484
00:45:58,506 --> 00:46:00,174
Straighten up!

485
00:46:03,637 --> 00:46:07,139
Now try to imagine that
many terrible hours lie ahead of you.

486
00:46:07,223 --> 00:46:09,516
Cruel questions, tricks,
blackmail, everything!

487
00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:16,231
Try to remember
all the things you've forgotten.

488
00:46:16,566 --> 00:46:20,194
Try to recall the most shameful memories.

489
00:46:20,987 --> 00:46:24,865
And remember,
I can find out everything about you

490
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:30,371
because the government has given me
the means to expose an individual.

491
00:46:37,879 --> 00:46:40,047
- Straighten up!
- Bastard.

492
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:43,342
I want you to think
I know everything about you.

493
00:46:43,843 --> 00:46:48,472
That is how I will trigger
the guilt-complex mechanism inside of you.

494
00:46:48,556 --> 00:46:50,182
I've had enough.

495
00:46:50,266 --> 00:46:53,060
Interrogate me!
Ask me some questions!

496
00:46:53,144 --> 00:46:56,647
- You want me to interrogate you?
- Yes.

497
00:46:56,731 --> 00:47:00,359
Then talk, talk!

498
00:47:00,443 --> 00:47:03,654
Tell me the most shameful things. Talk.

499
00:47:03,738 --> 00:47:07,658
Only if you confess
all your weakness and shame

500
00:47:07,742 --> 00:47:10,160
will you obtain my forgiveness
and my protection.

501
00:47:10,245 --> 00:47:13,539
I understand.
You treat them like children.

502
00:47:14,165 --> 00:47:16,250
Everyone becomes a child again,

503
00:47:16,334 --> 00:47:19,503
especially in the presence
of the established authorities.

504
00:47:19,587 --> 00:47:22,506
In my presence,
because I represent power.

505
00:47:23,174 --> 00:47:25,092
Straighten up!

506
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:26,593
The law.

507
00:47:27,095 --> 00:47:28,762
Sit up!

508
00:47:29,264 --> 00:47:30,931
The law.

509
00:47:32,475 --> 00:47:35,102
All laws,
both known and unknown.

510
00:47:35,186 --> 00:47:37,771
The suspect becomes a child again...

511
00:47:39,983 --> 00:47:42,026
and I become the father,

512
00:47:43,028 --> 00:47:45,404
the unassailable model.

513
00:47:45,488 --> 00:47:49,033
My face becomes God's face,
the face of your conscience.

514
00:47:49,117 --> 00:47:53,871
It's all staged to touch a deep chord in you,
to expose hidden feelings.

515
00:47:53,955 --> 00:47:57,207
Don't be upset. Here.

516
00:47:58,001 --> 00:48:00,794
I'm explaining this mentality
to you because...

517
00:48:01,713 --> 00:48:02,963
Well, why do you think?

518
00:48:03,048 --> 00:48:07,885
These are the foundations
the established authorities are built upon.

519
00:48:08,386 --> 00:48:10,554
University professors...

520
00:48:13,349 --> 00:48:18,562
heads of political parties,
tax attorneys, stationmasters.

521
00:48:18,646 --> 00:48:19,354
Here.

522
00:48:19,439 --> 00:48:23,400
Now I'll show you how we found
that whore in Mandrione.

523
00:48:23,485 --> 00:48:28,572
In the end, we policemen
aren't that different from criminals.

524
00:48:28,656 --> 00:48:31,575
Same way of speaking, same habits.

525
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:35,496
Sometimes even the same gestures.

526
00:48:36,164 --> 00:48:38,582
You're like a child,

527
00:48:38,666 --> 00:48:41,251
more than any other man I've ever met.

528
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:43,796
You shouldn't say that,

529
00:48:44,672 --> 00:48:46,673
that I'm a child.

530
00:48:48,968 --> 00:48:52,179
You shouldn't say that, understand?

531
00:48:52,722 --> 00:48:56,100
Other people are children, understand?

532
00:48:56,601 --> 00:48:59,895
- Will you drop the traffic jam story?
- It's true!

533
00:48:59,979 --> 00:49:01,480
No, wait a minute.

534
00:49:01,564 --> 00:49:05,609
We're going to leave you alone
to think things over.

535
00:49:05,693 --> 00:49:09,113
Think carefully about what
you should say and do, okay?

536
00:49:09,197 --> 00:49:10,697
We're leaving.

537
00:49:15,745 --> 00:49:18,789
- Mangani, you yell too much.
- Thanks.

538
00:49:18,873 --> 00:49:21,208
I yell too much.
I learned it all from you.

539
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:24,461
That guy's starting to get in the way.
Why doesn't he go do his job?

540
00:49:24,546 --> 00:49:27,506
- You're right, Chief.
- He's impeding the investigation.

541
00:49:27,882 --> 00:49:29,758
Holy shit.

542
00:49:35,223 --> 00:49:36,890
Have some coffee.

543
00:49:41,563 --> 00:49:44,857
If I'm not mistaken,
you decorated the Moroni house?

544
00:49:45,525 --> 00:49:46,191
Yes.

545
00:49:46,276 --> 00:49:49,862
I heard about it.
You found some interesting solutions.

546
00:49:50,405 --> 00:49:52,072
Art Nouveau, isn't it?

547
00:49:54,951 --> 00:49:58,662
Mr. Terzi, when was the last time
you saw poor Augusta?

548
00:49:58,746 --> 00:50:00,831
Three days before the murder.

549
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:03,125
She was blackmailing me.

550
00:50:03,751 --> 00:50:08,046
I received anonymous calls,
a man's voice.

551
00:50:08,756 --> 00:50:10,966
- It was him.
- Who?

552
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:13,677
The man who was with my wife.
They were in cahoots.

553
00:50:13,761 --> 00:50:15,846
He was the one calling me.

554
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:19,683
He had a certain tone of voice,
like he was used to being in charge.

555
00:50:19,767 --> 00:50:21,768
Why would they blackmail you?

556
00:50:21,853 --> 00:50:26,231
They enjoyed watching me suffer,
humiliating me.

557
00:50:27,567 --> 00:50:31,195
What form did this blackmail take?

558
00:50:31,279 --> 00:50:34,948
One day, the man called me and said

559
00:50:35,867 --> 00:50:39,953
he was going to put me on file
as a transvestite.

560
00:50:41,497 --> 00:50:43,540
I think he's somebody important.

561
00:50:44,792 --> 00:50:47,461
A military man, maybe.

562
00:50:49,005 --> 00:50:51,131
Or someone from the tax office.

563
00:50:51,799 --> 00:50:56,261
Augusta liked men with power.

564
00:50:56,346 --> 00:50:58,722
His name?
Give me the name.

565
00:50:58,806 --> 00:51:02,309
I don't know it.
If I knew it, I wouldn't be here.

566
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:05,854
I think he's the murderer.

567
00:51:06,981 --> 00:51:09,233
It's just a feeling.

568
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:16,448
You've forgotten his name?

569
00:51:16,532 --> 00:51:18,867
I never knew it.

570
00:51:23,665 --> 00:51:27,167
Don't worry. it'll be okay.

571
00:51:27,502 --> 00:51:29,253
Thank you.

572
00:51:38,221 --> 00:51:39,554
Well?

573
00:51:42,058 --> 00:51:44,935
- I think he's innocent.
- Innocent!

574
00:51:45,019 --> 00:51:47,187
I think he's innocent.

575
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:51,525
At 4:00 p.m. on Sunday, August 24,

576
00:51:51,734 --> 00:51:56,196
I killed Mrs. Augusta Terzi...

577
00:51:57,448 --> 00:52:00,534
with cold determination.

578
00:52:01,202 --> 00:52:03,620
There is one extenuating circumstance.

579
00:52:04,122 --> 00:52:09,084
The victim systematically mocked me.

580
00:52:09,168 --> 00:52:13,088
I left clues everywhere,

581
00:52:14,048 --> 00:52:17,634
not to sidetrack the investigation,

582
00:52:17,719 --> 00:52:19,803
but to prove...

583
00:52:20,471 --> 00:52:22,723
to prove...

584
00:52:22,807 --> 00:52:26,059
not to sidetrack the investigation,

585
00:52:26,144 --> 00:52:28,395
but to prove...

586
00:52:28,688 --> 00:52:30,772
to prove...

587
00:52:35,778 --> 00:52:39,698
that I am above suspicion.

588
00:52:42,076 --> 00:52:43,660
However...

589
00:52:44,912 --> 00:52:46,538
However...

590
00:52:46,622 --> 00:52:48,332
However,

591
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:53,253
if you send an innocent man
to prison in your place,

592
00:52:53,338 --> 00:52:55,172
then the fact...

593
00:52:57,258 --> 00:53:04,222
then the fact that you're above suspicion
has not been proven.

594
00:53:14,901 --> 00:53:16,443
POST OFFICE

595
00:53:20,073 --> 00:53:22,074
1 .2 kilograms.

596
00:53:24,619 --> 00:53:26,286
900 lire.

597
00:53:29,624 --> 00:53:32,709
Is this package
really going to police headquarters?

598
00:53:32,794 --> 00:53:35,128
Can't you read?

599
00:53:49,394 --> 00:53:52,771
- I'd like to talk to Patané, news desk.
- Just a minute.

600
00:53:54,816 --> 00:53:56,316
News desk.

601
00:53:56,567 --> 00:53:58,568
- Hello? Patané?
- Who's this?

602
00:53:58,653 --> 00:54:02,739
I can't tell you my name.
Your phone is tapped.

603
00:54:02,824 --> 00:54:06,076
- What kind of joke is this?
- Hello?

604
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:11,498
Homicide received a package containing
the victim Augusta Terzi's jewels,

605
00:54:11,749 --> 00:54:14,376
the killer's shoe and the razor blade.

606
00:54:15,211 --> 00:54:17,421
This definitively exonerates the husband.

607
00:54:17,505 --> 00:54:21,174
It's no use disguising your voice.
I recognize you.

608
00:54:36,983 --> 00:54:40,694
VIVA MAO

609
00:54:41,696 --> 00:54:47,617
In 1948, we removed 2,000 instances
of graffiti in favor of Stalin,

610
00:54:47,702 --> 00:54:50,287
50 for Lenin, 1,000 for Togliatti.

611
00:54:50,371 --> 00:54:51,955
Thirty for Marshall Tito.

612
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:53,540
300 for Mussolini.

613
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:56,084
411 for the Common Man's Front.

614
00:54:56,169 --> 00:55:01,131
But in 1956, Stalin's fell to 100.

615
00:55:01,466 --> 00:55:02,966
A huge drop.

616
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:05,427
- And Togliatti?
- Stable.

617
00:55:05,511 --> 00:55:08,346
In 1958, we had 100 "Viva Khrushchev,"

618
00:55:08,431 --> 00:55:10,515
50 for Mao Tse,

619
00:55:11,392 --> 00:55:14,811
and 500 "Down with Stalin" also appeared.

620
00:55:14,896 --> 00:55:18,982
I'd like to point out we had orders
not to remove those, obviously.

621
00:55:19,066 --> 00:55:22,152
Last year, "Viva Mao" went up to 3,000.

622
00:55:22,236 --> 00:55:26,239
Ho Chi Minh went up to 10,000,
Che Guevara, 1,000,

623
00:55:26,324 --> 00:55:28,325
Marcuse, 11, both for and against.

624
00:55:28,409 --> 00:55:31,453
And something new.
We found a couple "Viva Sade!"

625
00:55:31,537 --> 00:55:32,579
The Marquis.

626
00:55:32,663 --> 00:55:35,499
This year we expect 10,000 for Mao,

627
00:55:35,583 --> 00:55:38,502
500 for Trotsky, 10 for Amendola

628
00:55:38,586 --> 00:55:41,171
and maybe 500 or 600 for Stalin.

629
00:55:41,255 --> 00:55:43,423
What are those two doing?

630
00:55:50,515 --> 00:55:52,557
Go check them out.

631
00:55:52,642 --> 00:55:55,018
See if they have passes
and where they're going.

632
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:05,862
Youth, youth!

633
00:56:06,113 --> 00:56:08,073
Writing slogans on walls!

634
00:56:09,242 --> 00:56:12,619
Young students and laborers
prowling around at night,

635
00:56:12,703 --> 00:56:17,040
spouting their revolution on the phone,
in their classes, at their jobs!

636
00:56:17,124 --> 00:56:20,919
Using up tons of red paint
just to insult us!

637
00:56:21,003 --> 00:56:23,255
I know what needs to be done!

638
00:56:23,339 --> 00:56:27,968
It'll take more than whitewashers to combat
this subversive, antiauthoritarian tide!

639
00:56:28,928 --> 00:56:30,971
Pace went to the Homicide Division.

640
00:56:31,055 --> 00:56:33,390
- Who's he talking to?
- Mangani.

641
00:56:35,643 --> 00:56:37,644
MURDERER

642
00:56:43,484 --> 00:56:46,403
We must send
our young officers back to school.

643
00:56:46,821 --> 00:56:51,616
They must infiltrate universities, factories,
grow beards and long hair,

644
00:56:51,993 --> 00:56:54,452
wear greasy overalls.

645
00:56:54,537 --> 00:56:58,331
We must know everything,
control everything!

646
00:56:58,708 --> 00:57:01,501
We'll use our own sons if we have to.

647
00:57:05,506 --> 00:57:06,673
Hello, Chief.

648
00:57:06,757 --> 00:57:08,174
Thanks.

649
00:57:46,213 --> 00:57:47,839
Hello, Chief.

650
00:57:48,132 --> 00:57:51,259
- Antonio Pace's recordings.
- Right away.

651
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:57,974
- The Terzi case.
- What happened?

652
00:57:58,059 --> 00:58:01,227
Important new developments.
I'll keep you posted.

653
00:58:08,944 --> 00:58:11,154
- Hello, Chief.
- Hello.

654
00:58:14,241 --> 00:58:16,242
Chief, I need your signature please.

655
00:58:18,245 --> 00:58:19,704
Thanks.

656
00:58:28,756 --> 00:58:32,008
- Antonio, where have you been all day?
- The police station.

657
00:58:32,093 --> 00:58:34,177
Is the Political Division
hassling you again?

658
00:58:34,261 --> 00:58:36,721
- No. I was at Homicide.
- How come?

659
00:58:36,806 --> 00:58:39,099
It was about that woman
who was killed in my building.

660
00:58:39,183 --> 00:58:40,934
- They're implicating you?
- No.

661
00:58:41,018 --> 00:58:43,311
They want to know
if the tenants saw anything.

662
00:58:43,396 --> 00:58:45,897
- What did you tell them?
- Nothing, of course.

663
00:58:45,981 --> 00:58:48,608
- Not even that you slept with her?
- Bitch.

664
00:58:48,693 --> 00:58:50,860
Shut up.
My phone's tapped.

665
00:58:50,945 --> 00:58:55,031
Actually, since I'm here, I'd like
to talk to the cop that's on duty now.

666
00:58:55,116 --> 00:58:57,784
Comrade, you have the degrading job

667
00:58:57,868 --> 00:59:01,579
of unlawfully spying
on the birth of the Italian revolution,

668
00:59:01,664 --> 00:59:04,708
but you're being exploited too.

669
00:59:04,792 --> 00:59:08,044
Join us,
or at least ask for a raise.

670
00:59:08,129 --> 00:59:10,255
Turn it off.

671
00:59:11,674 --> 00:59:13,383
- Wait a second, Chief.
- What?

672
00:59:13,467 --> 00:59:16,469
His ideas are truly abominable
except for that last one.

673
00:59:16,554 --> 00:59:20,640
I've been working here 30 years
and still make 140,000 lire a month.

674
00:59:20,725 --> 00:59:23,017
- So?
- If I didn't have culture to fall back on...

675
00:59:23,102 --> 00:59:24,978
- What?
- I sell books in installments.

676
00:59:25,062 --> 00:59:26,980
- What's that got to do with me?
- Nothing.

677
00:59:27,064 --> 00:59:29,983
- I'll report you.
- Chief.

678
00:59:39,994 --> 00:59:42,245
- Just a minute.
- News desk.

679
00:59:42,329 --> 00:59:44,205
- Hello? Patané?
- Who's this?

680
00:59:44,290 --> 00:59:48,126
I can't tell you my name.
Your phone is tapped.

681
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:51,671
- What kind of joke is this?
- Hello?

682
00:59:51,756 --> 00:59:56,926
Homicide received a package containing
the victim Augusta Terzi's jewels...

683
00:59:57,553 --> 00:59:59,220
Who does he remind you of?

684
00:59:59,305 --> 01:00:01,306
...the killer's shoe and the razor blade.

685
01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:04,559
- One of them is Patané.
- Yes, but the other one?

686
01:00:05,770 --> 01:00:07,270
Did you receive this package?

687
01:00:07,354 --> 01:00:11,316
We got it, but an hour after
this article was published.

688
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:15,820
So it can't be the husband
because we have him here.

689
01:00:15,905 --> 01:00:17,906
He could have an accomplice.

690
01:00:19,492 --> 01:00:24,162
I think Terzi's husband is innocent
and should be released.

691
01:00:25,206 --> 01:00:29,709
Detective, this is my case.
The husband stays in jail.

692
01:00:32,379 --> 01:00:33,338
All right.

693
01:00:33,422 --> 01:00:35,548
- All right, Biglia?
- We'll keep him in jail.

694
01:00:35,633 --> 01:00:37,383
When will you understand?

695
01:00:37,927 --> 01:00:39,844
The man is innocent.

696
01:00:39,929 --> 01:00:45,558
It's better if we hold him,
at least until the public forgets this story.

697
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:48,394
You're a bureaucrat.

698
01:00:48,604 --> 01:00:51,231
You're afraid of public opinion.

699
01:01:16,298 --> 01:01:18,424
Don't get upset.

700
01:01:18,843 --> 01:01:20,844
Don't worry.

701
01:01:21,470 --> 01:01:25,056
He's a reactionary, a Bourbon straight out
of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.

702
01:01:25,724 --> 01:01:28,726
He just panders to the minister
and public opinion.

703
01:01:28,811 --> 01:01:31,688
He's like an old pair of underwear.
He won't last.

704
01:01:31,772 --> 01:01:33,898
Don't worry.

705
01:01:46,328 --> 01:01:48,079
What do you want?

706
01:01:49,123 --> 01:01:50,623
DRAMATIC TWIST IN THE TERZI CASE

707
01:01:50,708 --> 01:01:52,542
Here you go.

708
01:01:52,793 --> 01:01:54,252
What should I tell him?

709
01:01:54,336 --> 01:01:56,462
- Tell who?
- Mangani.

710
01:01:56,547 --> 01:01:58,423
About what?

711
01:01:58,841 --> 01:02:04,721
He wants to know if I know who called me
about the package and the jewels.

712
01:02:04,805 --> 01:02:06,890
Why ask me?

713
01:02:07,224 --> 01:02:08,433
It was you.

714
01:02:08,517 --> 01:02:10,018
Think about it.

715
01:02:10,102 --> 01:02:14,397
How could I have called you if the package
hadn't arrived at the station yet?

716
01:02:14,481 --> 01:02:15,940
It was you!

717
01:02:16,025 --> 01:02:19,193
You can't go around
saying that I call you.

718
01:02:19,278 --> 01:02:21,154
I don't call you!

719
01:02:22,823 --> 01:02:24,532
I do favors for you,

720
01:02:24,617 --> 01:02:26,868
and you'd better be careful.

721
01:02:32,124 --> 01:02:34,375
This vending machine
makes great espresso.

722
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:36,544
I know, but I can't drink espresso.

723
01:02:36,629 --> 01:02:38,588
Get a cappuccino.

724
01:02:38,672 --> 01:02:41,341
You want me to get rid
of that vending machine?

725
01:02:41,425 --> 01:02:43,343
Misticò, get back to work!

726
01:02:43,427 --> 01:02:45,261
You too.
Get out of here, please.

727
01:02:45,346 --> 01:02:47,055
Get out of here.

728
01:02:54,355 --> 01:02:55,939
Bye.

729
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:07,325
I need your advice on something.

730
01:03:07,409 --> 01:03:10,411
What's eating you?

731
01:03:10,496 --> 01:03:12,080
Come along with me.

732
01:03:18,504 --> 01:03:21,464
- If we don't help each other...
- A message.

733
01:03:21,882 --> 01:03:23,174
Now what?

734
01:03:23,258 --> 01:03:26,344
In this city,
they're not just killing prostitutes.

735
01:03:26,428 --> 01:03:28,888
They're killing order and social stability.

736
01:03:28,973 --> 01:03:30,807
Three sit-ins in 24 hours.

737
01:03:30,891 --> 01:03:33,184
Homeless people, students, teachers.

738
01:03:33,268 --> 01:03:34,978
The teachers!

739
01:03:35,062 --> 01:03:39,315
Italians! In six months,
81 million hours' worth of strikes.

740
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:41,401
- Got an aspirin?
- No.

741
01:03:42,236 --> 01:03:44,779
Chief, do you believe
Terzi's husband is innocent?

742
01:03:44,863 --> 01:03:46,322
Of course I do.

743
01:03:46,407 --> 01:03:50,201
There's only one way to prove
Terzi's husband is innocent.

744
01:03:50,619 --> 01:03:55,081
- We have to find the man with the blue tie.
- We have to find him.

745
01:03:55,165 --> 01:03:59,877
The blue tie you wore
the night of the murder...

746
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:04,507
- Where did you buy it?
- At Cenci's, near the Pantheon.

747
01:04:04,591 --> 01:04:06,467
He sold two of them.

748
01:04:07,344 --> 01:04:09,178
Yours we can rule out,

749
01:04:09,430 --> 01:04:13,016
and he remembers selling
the other one to a woman.

750
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:14,267
Augusta Terzi.

751
01:04:14,351 --> 01:04:18,771
So the victim gave the tie
to her murderer.

752
01:04:18,856 --> 01:04:22,734
The victim gave the tie to her murderer.

753
01:04:23,527 --> 01:04:27,196
Given their marriage,
I doubt she gave it to her husband.

754
01:04:27,281 --> 01:04:30,783
That seems logical.
Count him out.

755
01:04:33,037 --> 01:04:34,662
And me?

756
01:04:36,582 --> 01:04:38,750
What can I do for you?

757
01:04:39,793 --> 01:04:42,462
How can I help you?

758
01:04:42,963 --> 01:04:45,882
Maybe you want my blue tie?

759
01:04:45,966 --> 01:04:49,469
You can stop by my place.
Ask for it.

760
01:04:49,887 --> 01:04:54,015
My cleaning lady's there in the mornings.

761
01:04:56,852 --> 01:05:00,813
- Do you have an aspirin?
- I can really stop by your place?

762
01:05:02,649 --> 01:05:07,111
You understand,
three sit-ins in 24 hours.

763
01:05:07,196 --> 01:05:10,156
Students, homeless people, teachers.

764
01:05:10,491 --> 01:05:12,492
Teachers.

765
01:05:13,202 --> 01:05:17,747
- May I go?
- You know what?

766
01:05:17,831 --> 01:05:21,042
- Compared to this, I prefer Homicide.
- Of course.

767
01:05:21,126 --> 01:05:23,002
Thanks, Chief.

768
01:05:38,644 --> 01:05:42,271
So if I need to, I can really
get the tie from your place?

769
01:06:17,141 --> 01:06:18,891
How disgusting.

770
01:06:19,393 --> 01:06:21,394
Take that undershirt off.

771
01:06:21,478 --> 01:06:24,063
I promise your mother will never find out.

772
01:06:25,107 --> 01:06:27,024
And change your shirt.

773
01:06:27,401 --> 01:06:29,694
You look like a Swiss waiter.

774
01:06:30,070 --> 01:06:33,573
You wear short socks like a priest
or a seminary student,

775
01:06:33,657 --> 01:06:36,367
or rather like what you are:
a policeman.

776
01:06:38,078 --> 01:06:41,706
Don't you have any brighter suits,
something happier?

777
01:06:41,790 --> 01:06:44,000
- Something normal even?
- No.

778
01:06:44,084 --> 01:06:47,753
People must change sidewalks
when they see you

779
01:06:47,838 --> 01:06:50,339
because they can tell you're a cop.

780
01:06:50,424 --> 01:06:56,429
You stink of barracks,
file rooms, jail cells.

781
01:06:57,181 --> 01:07:00,433
At least priests smell like incense.

782
01:07:00,517 --> 01:07:04,270
The authorities should hand out
free deodorant to their employees.

783
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:46,145
I could murder you
with my bare hands.

784
01:07:46,647 --> 01:07:48,272
How brave.

785
01:07:49,858 --> 01:07:51,776
You'd lead the investigation.

786
01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:53,819
Who'd solve the crime?

787
01:08:21,473 --> 01:08:24,308
- Would you do me a favor?
- Yes.

788
01:08:26,561 --> 01:08:29,438
Would you go in there
and buy me all those blue ties?

789
01:08:29,523 --> 01:08:31,816
The ones in the window.

790
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:33,693
Why don't you go buy them?

791
01:08:33,777 --> 01:08:37,446
They'll think I'm a competitor
and take advantage of me.

792
01:08:37,531 --> 01:08:39,782
- Do me a favor.
- It will cost a lot.

793
01:08:39,866 --> 01:08:41,450
- How much?
- 50 or 60,000 lire.

794
01:08:41,535 --> 01:08:43,869
Okay. Take what you need.

795
01:08:44,663 --> 01:08:47,540
Satisfy my curiosity.
Why do they all have to be blue?

796
01:08:48,375 --> 01:08:51,377
I'm a theater impresario.

797
01:08:51,878 --> 01:08:53,379
- Pre-show stuff.
- I see.

798
01:08:53,463 --> 01:08:58,384
The name of the revue is
"50 Blue Ties For 50 Babes."

799
01:08:58,719 --> 01:08:59,927
Bravo.

800
01:09:00,012 --> 01:09:02,555
Do me a favor.
I'll wait for you down there.

801
01:09:02,639 --> 01:09:04,640
- Where?
- Under the colonnade.

802
01:09:25,537 --> 01:09:27,580
Hurry up.

803
01:09:33,295 --> 01:09:34,920
Here you are.

804
01:09:35,881 --> 01:09:39,342
4,000 lire is your change.

805
01:09:40,218 --> 01:09:43,179
You know what happened?
This is good.

806
01:09:43,263 --> 01:09:44,764
They thought I was a cop.

807
01:09:44,848 --> 01:09:48,059
They gave me a big discount.

808
01:09:48,143 --> 01:09:51,771
One man even called me Sergeant.

809
01:09:52,230 --> 01:09:55,149
Okay, here you go.

810
01:09:55,233 --> 01:09:56,901
Count them. I got 25.

811
01:09:56,985 --> 01:09:59,612
- What do you do for a living?
- What?

812
01:09:59,696 --> 01:10:01,781
- What do you do for a living?
- Me?

813
01:10:01,865 --> 01:10:04,241
I'm a plumber.

814
01:10:04,326 --> 01:10:06,452
- A plumber.
- I work when I feel like it.

815
01:10:06,536 --> 01:10:09,538
- Who did you vote for?
- Who'd I vote for?

816
01:10:09,623 --> 01:10:11,916
Why do you care?

817
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:15,628
- Tell me who you vote for!
- For whoever I want! Why?

818
01:10:15,712 --> 01:10:18,839
I'll keep one of these ties.
You keep the other 24.

819
01:10:18,924 --> 01:10:22,218
What?
What's the meaning of this?

820
01:10:22,302 --> 01:10:25,388
- I want an explanation, sir.
- I'll explain now.

821
01:10:25,472 --> 01:10:30,559
Take these 24 ties
to the police station immediately.

822
01:10:30,644 --> 01:10:32,269
Go to the Homicide Division.

823
01:10:32,354 --> 01:10:35,147
I'm not a theater impresario.

824
01:10:35,232 --> 01:10:38,651
I'm a murderer.

825
01:10:39,986 --> 01:10:41,487
What did you say?

826
01:10:42,572 --> 01:10:44,156
A murderer.

827
01:10:45,450 --> 01:10:47,118
A murderer.

828
01:10:47,202 --> 01:10:49,495
Do you read the papers?

829
01:10:50,872 --> 01:10:54,083
Do you remember the lady
that was murdered on via del Tempio?

830
01:10:54,167 --> 01:10:56,043
I killed her.

831
01:10:57,546 --> 01:11:01,132
What are you saying?
A respectable man like you?

832
01:11:01,216 --> 01:11:03,843
You're pulling my leg, right?

833
01:11:03,927 --> 01:11:07,012
No, I'm not pulling your leg.

834
01:11:07,639 --> 01:11:09,432
You're in trouble now.

835
01:11:09,516 --> 01:11:12,601
Why am I in trouble?
I didn't do anything!

836
01:11:12,686 --> 01:11:14,520
Shut up for a minute!

837
01:11:15,188 --> 01:11:17,273
Let me tell you how it works.

838
01:11:17,357 --> 01:11:20,568
Anyone who comes into contact
with a murderer is in trouble.

839
01:11:21,027 --> 01:11:23,446
Run over to the police station,
Homicide Division.

840
01:11:24,072 --> 01:11:26,449
Give them a detailed description of me.

841
01:11:26,533 --> 01:11:32,121
Give them the time, the place,
the way that we met.

842
01:11:32,205 --> 01:11:36,375
Look at me closely.
Describe me in detail.

843
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:41,213
You don't stand six inches away
from a murderer every day.

844
01:11:41,298 --> 01:11:42,840
Examine everything.

845
01:11:42,924 --> 01:11:45,050
Remember how I comb my hair,

846
01:11:45,135 --> 01:11:49,054
if I have a mustache or not,
what I'm wearing, if I have a tie.

847
01:11:49,139 --> 01:11:54,226
At least give me time to stop
by my house and see my wife and son.

848
01:11:54,311 --> 01:11:57,521
Go to the police station.
Go to the police station!

849
01:11:58,064 --> 01:12:01,317
- Give me time for a quick shave!
- Stop acting like an idiot!

850
01:12:01,401 --> 01:12:03,027
Act like a citizen!

851
01:12:03,111 --> 01:12:04,612
- Wait, listen.
- Go!

852
01:12:04,696 --> 01:12:07,573
- Listen!
- Go to the police station!

853
01:12:08,033 --> 01:12:09,742
Wait, listen!

854
01:12:10,869 --> 01:12:12,369
Sir!

855
01:12:13,955 --> 01:12:16,332
- Go to the police station!
- Come back.

856
01:12:57,958 --> 01:13:01,043
Go on, run the red light.
You're above the law.

857
01:13:01,127 --> 01:13:03,629
No, what are you asking me to do?

858
01:13:03,713 --> 01:13:07,216
Go on, run it!
Run the red light!

859
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:09,718
- You want me to run the light?
- Yes, go!

860
01:13:09,803 --> 01:13:11,804
You can do whatever you want.

861
01:13:11,888 --> 01:13:14,515
- Go on, do it.
- I'll do it. Watch out.

862
01:13:14,599 --> 01:13:16,517
- That's it!
- I'll do anything!

863
01:13:16,601 --> 01:13:19,645
I'm going! I'm going!

864
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:22,231
There, you see?

865
01:13:22,315 --> 01:13:23,774
The traffic cop's coming.

866
01:13:23,858 --> 01:13:27,111
- Show him your nifty police badge.
- Obviously I will.

867
01:13:27,195 --> 01:13:30,155
Show him you're an important man.
He'll be trembling!

868
01:13:31,074 --> 01:13:32,074
Treat him badly.

869
01:13:32,158 --> 01:13:33,993
Driver's license and registration.

870
01:13:34,077 --> 01:13:35,995
Police.

871
01:13:36,079 --> 01:13:38,080
- Hurry, please.
- Sorry, Chief.

872
01:13:38,164 --> 01:13:40,749
You can commit any crime you want.

873
01:13:40,834 --> 01:13:42,459
I'm telling you.

874
01:13:59,728 --> 01:14:03,105
Good. You reminded me
of that decapitated girl in Castel Gandolfo.

875
01:14:03,189 --> 01:14:05,399
Aquatic rape.

876
01:14:21,499 --> 01:14:25,753
Do you think you could kill me here
without getting caught?

877
01:14:28,214 --> 01:14:32,885
Theme: How a policeman commits murder
on a crowded beach without getting caught.

878
01:14:37,432 --> 01:14:39,725
The parking attendant saw me,

879
01:14:40,310 --> 01:14:42,227
the ticket collector,

880
01:14:43,897 --> 01:14:45,397
the lifeguards

881
01:14:47,692 --> 01:14:50,486
and the people in the cabana next to ours.

882
01:14:50,570 --> 01:14:53,656
I'd say the parking attendant
is the most dangerous.

883
01:14:53,740 --> 01:14:55,324
Yeah, right.

884
01:14:55,408 --> 01:14:58,160
A parking attendant
reporting a big shot like you?

885
01:14:58,244 --> 01:14:59,662
Impossible.

886
01:14:59,746 --> 01:15:03,666
You'd have to sign a crime
with your first and last name to get caught.

887
01:15:03,750 --> 01:15:07,169
- Otherwise, who would consider you?
- Augusta, don't tempt me.

888
01:15:07,253 --> 01:15:09,922
It would be too easy for me.

889
01:15:12,467 --> 01:15:13,634
Come on.

890
01:15:14,094 --> 01:15:16,720
Come up with a nice crime.

891
01:15:16,805 --> 01:15:19,640
I'll cut off your head and hide it.

892
01:15:20,225 --> 01:15:22,267
No, I'll throw it in the sea

893
01:15:23,144 --> 01:15:24,895
for the fish.

894
01:15:25,438 --> 01:15:30,567
A lifeguard will find your body
in the cabana at sunset.

895
01:15:32,112 --> 01:15:36,782
The magistrate, a guy from Latina,
won't examine you until the next day,

896
01:15:36,866 --> 01:15:40,619
when you're in an advanced state
of decomposition.

897
01:15:43,748 --> 01:15:45,249
What the...

898
01:15:49,838 --> 01:15:52,172
Bitch!

899
01:16:11,693 --> 01:16:13,235
Augusta!

900
01:16:19,117 --> 01:16:22,411
Augusta, stop joking around.
Come out.

901
01:16:22,495 --> 01:16:24,455
WOMEN

902
01:16:31,921 --> 01:16:34,381
Augusta, let's go!

903
01:16:42,056 --> 01:16:46,059
We need an official mandate
to demolish these brothels.

904
01:16:53,860 --> 01:16:55,736
Augusta!

905
01:17:18,885 --> 01:17:21,094
Use the pads, sir.

906
01:17:29,938 --> 01:17:33,190
Your colleague stopped by this morning,
the young Neapolitan.

907
01:17:33,274 --> 01:17:35,400
- What's his name?
- Who? Biglia?

908
01:17:35,985 --> 01:17:37,486
That's it, Biglia.

909
01:17:37,570 --> 01:17:39,613
- What did he want?
- I don't know.

910
01:17:39,697 --> 01:17:43,408
He was looking for a tie,
but I didn't give it to him.

911
01:17:43,493 --> 01:17:45,869
How could you have?
I'm wearing it.

912
01:17:47,914 --> 01:17:50,415
Then you must have two of them.

913
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:54,503
I saw the other one stuffed
in your sneakers yesterday.

914
01:17:59,801 --> 01:18:02,261
He wanted to look at your shoes too.

915
01:18:03,054 --> 01:18:04,930
I knew he was a snoop right away.

916
01:18:05,014 --> 01:18:07,099
He asked me loads of questions.

917
01:18:08,184 --> 01:18:11,854
- What did he want to know?
- If you ever have women over.

918
01:18:11,938 --> 01:18:14,773
- Anything else?
- If you have a girlfriend.

919
01:18:14,858 --> 01:18:16,942
- Was that all?
- What you do on Sundays.

920
01:18:17,026 --> 01:18:20,195
- Go in there. I've got work to do.
- I haven't finished, sir.

921
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:21,780
Finish later.

922
01:19:13,541 --> 01:19:15,125
HOMICIDE DIVISION

923
01:19:18,838 --> 01:19:20,631
Good morning!

924
01:19:20,715 --> 01:19:25,135
- How are you, Homicide?
- How's life in the Political Division?

925
01:19:34,646 --> 01:19:36,146
Morning.

926
01:19:36,940 --> 01:19:40,692
To save you some time,
I brought you my tie.

927
01:19:54,916 --> 01:19:56,541
What's wrong?

928
01:20:20,608 --> 01:20:22,109
- What did he do?
- Murder.

929
01:20:22,193 --> 01:20:23,652
I'd do it again!

930
01:20:23,736 --> 01:20:26,029
He killed his employer.

931
01:20:26,114 --> 01:20:29,282
Can you come in here for a second?
There's this guy...

932
01:20:30,284 --> 01:20:32,494
- What's going on this morning?
- Sorry.

933
01:20:32,578 --> 01:20:34,538
- Will you explain?
- Nothing.

934
01:20:34,622 --> 01:20:36,581
He's probably a psychopathic liar.

935
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:46,508
This gentleman wants
to ask you a few questions.

936
01:20:50,596 --> 01:20:52,139
Who is he?

937
01:21:04,694 --> 01:21:06,278
- Well?
- Excuse me.

938
01:21:06,362 --> 01:21:08,363
Excuse me, sir.

939
01:21:08,448 --> 01:21:09,614
Maybe...

940
01:21:10,033 --> 01:21:13,535
What am I saying?
I'm sure I've made a mistake.

941
01:21:13,619 --> 01:21:15,620
About what?

942
01:21:17,999 --> 01:21:21,126
- I mistook you for someone else.
- Who?

943
01:21:22,295 --> 01:21:26,131
Earlier, he thought he recognized you.

944
01:21:26,215 --> 01:21:27,758
He says that this morning

945
01:21:27,842 --> 01:21:32,846
a strange man gave him
some money to buy all those ties.

946
01:21:33,347 --> 01:21:38,226
Then he told him
he was Augusta Terzi's killer.

947
01:21:38,311 --> 01:21:39,895
- And...
- Let him talk.

948
01:21:39,979 --> 01:21:42,355
- Go on. Talk.
- Thank you.

949
01:21:42,982 --> 01:21:44,941
Well, that's what happened.

950
01:21:45,026 --> 01:21:47,944
I met this person

951
01:21:48,029 --> 01:21:51,948
who told me to run straight
to the police station.

952
01:21:52,033 --> 01:21:54,910
- Who was he?
- Who knows? Some maniac.

953
01:21:54,994 --> 01:22:00,207
Maybe he was a theater impresario,
or maybe he worked in the cinema.

954
01:22:00,291 --> 01:22:03,043
And I fell for it, of course.

955
01:22:03,669 --> 01:22:07,339
He warned me himself
that I'd be in hot water.

956
01:22:07,423 --> 01:22:09,758
- What do you do for a living?
- Me?

957
01:22:09,842 --> 01:22:11,885
Well, I...

958
01:22:11,969 --> 01:22:13,428
I'm a plumber.

959
01:22:13,513 --> 01:22:15,680
- A tinsmith.
- Plumber.

960
01:22:15,765 --> 01:22:17,557
Plumber?

961
01:22:17,642 --> 01:22:19,142
Tinsmith.

962
01:22:19,227 --> 01:22:22,145
- Tinsmith is an old word.
- Say that you're a tinsmith.

963
01:22:22,230 --> 01:22:24,231
Yes, I'm a tinsmith.

964
01:22:24,649 --> 01:22:27,776
- What did you say?
- As you just said, I'm a tinsmith.

965
01:22:27,860 --> 01:22:31,238
- There's no reason to worry.
- I have your word?

966
01:22:31,322 --> 01:22:32,989
- You can relax now.
- Thank you.

967
01:22:33,074 --> 01:22:35,575
- You're a citizen.
- Thank you.

968
01:22:35,660 --> 01:22:40,372
- We respect our citizens.
- Well said. Thank you, sir.

969
01:22:40,998 --> 01:22:44,042
Mangani, come with me, please.

970
01:22:45,211 --> 01:22:47,295
At once.

971
01:22:49,382 --> 01:22:51,049
I'll deal with you later.

972
01:22:51,843 --> 01:22:54,970
- You set up this confrontation...
- No, the tinsmith came to us.

973
01:22:55,054 --> 01:22:57,806
Without even following
proper procedure!

974
01:22:57,890 --> 01:23:01,434
- It was Biglia, not me.
- Mangani, I'll have your head!

975
01:23:01,894 --> 01:23:04,146
- Watch yourself!
- Go back into your offices!

976
01:23:04,230 --> 01:23:06,148
What are you doing?
Go back to work.

977
01:23:06,232 --> 01:23:08,567
- This is my fault.
- And you shut up!

978
01:23:08,651 --> 01:23:12,028
I don't see so well anymore.
It can't be him.

979
01:23:12,113 --> 01:23:14,656
He's wearing blue
and the other man was in beige.

980
01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:17,117
- I have an idea.
- Let go of my arm.

981
01:23:17,201 --> 01:23:19,077
I'm going to hold both of them,

982
01:23:19,162 --> 01:23:22,831
Terzi's husband
and this idiot tinsmith with the ties.

983
01:23:22,915 --> 01:23:24,875
- What do you say?
- You do your job.

984
01:23:24,959 --> 01:23:27,085
I'll do what I have to do.

985
01:23:33,092 --> 01:23:35,969
Now, my dear tinsmith,
you're going to tell me the truth.

986
01:23:36,053 --> 01:23:39,097
You're involved in this,
and I'm going to screw you!

987
01:23:39,182 --> 01:23:41,099
I got the cappuccino,
but it's too sweet.

988
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:45,854
You're supposed to take half
bitter coffee and half sweet milk.

989
01:23:46,647 --> 01:23:50,734
Misticò, I'll put you back
on the beat in Piazza Navona!

990
01:23:50,818 --> 01:23:53,028
Get that machine out of here!

991
01:23:53,112 --> 01:23:54,946
If anyone asks, I'm not here.

992
01:24:15,635 --> 01:24:17,802
Excuse me, Commander, are you alone?

993
01:24:17,887 --> 01:24:18,887
Yes.

994
01:24:19,722 --> 01:24:21,890
I wanted to ask if you authorized

995
01:24:21,974 --> 01:24:26,311
the investigation of me
as a suspect in the Terzi case?

996
01:24:26,395 --> 01:24:30,106
I'll request a detailed report
from the officer,

997
01:24:30,399 --> 01:24:33,985
and you and I can talk about it
over dinner tonight.

998
01:24:34,487 --> 01:24:36,863
That's not enough.

999
01:24:36,948 --> 01:24:40,283
I demand that the entire Homicide squad
be put under investigation!

1000
01:24:40,368 --> 01:24:43,912
I have a powder keg in my office
that could blow up their entire system,

1001
01:24:43,996 --> 01:24:45,830
their public and private lives!

1002
01:24:45,915 --> 01:24:48,291
I've got dirt on everyone,
and you know it!

1003
01:24:48,376 --> 01:24:52,003
- Okay, but at your own risk.
- Of course.

1004
01:24:59,053 --> 01:25:00,553
Technician!

1005
01:25:01,639 --> 01:25:04,140
I need to withdraw three recordings.
Political Division.

1006
01:25:04,225 --> 01:25:07,310
The commissioner gave me orders
not to release anything.

1007
01:25:10,690 --> 01:25:13,817
- When did you get the order?
- I can't tell you.

1008
01:25:14,235 --> 01:25:16,736
Was it on paper or over the phone?

1009
01:25:16,821 --> 01:25:18,822
Please let it go.

1010
01:25:19,865 --> 01:25:23,118
What do you care if I borrow
three tapes for a couple hours?

1011
01:25:23,202 --> 01:25:26,413
Oh, I care! I'll lose my job.

1012
01:25:26,497 --> 01:25:30,959
- We all care about our careers.
- Exactly. In my small way, I care too.

1013
01:25:31,043 --> 01:25:32,502
Be patient.

1014
01:25:32,586 --> 01:25:35,380
Do me this favor.

1015
01:25:36,882 --> 01:25:38,717
That was a bomb!

1016
01:25:38,801 --> 01:25:41,052
- Get out of the way!
- Down there!

1017
01:25:44,015 --> 01:25:46,725
- It was by the ventilator, Chief!
- Stop!

1018
01:25:46,809 --> 01:25:49,144
Go back to your stations! Stop!

1019
01:25:49,895 --> 01:25:51,563
- Where was it?
- Down there.

1020
01:25:51,647 --> 01:25:54,941
Please, please!
Policemen only.

1021
01:25:55,026 --> 01:25:57,819
Everyone else, turn back.
You too. Out, please!

1022
01:25:57,903 --> 01:26:00,488
- Over here, Chief.
- Be careful.

1023
01:26:01,449 --> 01:26:03,867
- Be careful!
- This way.

1024
01:26:03,951 --> 01:26:06,077
This is a serious matter.

1025
01:26:07,288 --> 01:26:09,414
- Let me through.
- Let him through.

1026
01:26:10,082 --> 01:26:12,334
- Don't touch anything!
- Don't touch!

1027
01:26:12,418 --> 01:26:13,960
Don't touch anything.

1028
01:26:14,045 --> 01:26:16,087
This time, they really messed up.

1029
01:26:18,424 --> 01:26:19,841
Attention!

1030
01:26:28,768 --> 01:26:30,685
They're here.
They're coming.

1031
01:26:37,902 --> 01:26:40,362
This is the last straw.
It's unbelievable.

1032
01:26:46,285 --> 01:26:50,163
I just received the message:
There were two more attacks at 6:30 p.m.

1033
01:26:50,247 --> 01:26:53,541
One was at the American Express office,
the other at the courthouse.

1034
01:26:57,838 --> 01:27:00,632
- Let him through, please.
- Yes, let him through.

1035
01:27:00,716 --> 01:27:03,843
This is where the explosion occurred.

1036
01:27:03,928 --> 01:27:06,429
In my modest opinion,
we should act decisively.

1037
01:27:06,514 --> 01:27:08,556
We know each
and every one of them.

1038
01:27:08,641 --> 01:27:12,685
We have to show them how resolute we are.
They've gone too far!

1039
01:27:13,854 --> 01:27:16,356
I'm giving you all carte blanche!

1040
01:27:16,607 --> 01:27:19,859
- Is that clear?
- Very.

1041
01:27:20,486 --> 01:27:21,486
Good.

1042
01:27:21,570 --> 01:27:24,948
Let him through, please.
Let him through!

1043
01:27:48,472 --> 01:27:50,348
Death to the man!

1044
01:27:51,976 --> 01:27:55,019
Mao, Mao, Ho Chi Minh!

1045
01:27:55,104 --> 01:27:58,022
Mao, Mao, Ho Chi Minh!

1046
01:28:07,032 --> 01:28:09,200
Death to the man!

1047
01:28:16,375 --> 01:28:18,793
- Chief.
- What do you want?

1048
01:28:18,878 --> 01:28:20,378
Get out of here!

1049
01:28:38,397 --> 01:28:40,482
Check all their ID's!

1050
01:28:43,277 --> 01:28:45,904
No statements to the press for now.

1051
01:28:46,322 --> 01:28:48,781
- How many of them are our informants?
- Five.

1052
01:28:48,866 --> 01:28:50,658
Leave them all together until tonight.

1053
01:29:01,462 --> 01:29:02,962
What do you want?

1054
01:29:03,422 --> 01:29:06,257
No, what do you want?
You were looking at me.

1055
01:29:06,342 --> 01:29:09,135
Me? I'm half blind.

1056
01:29:09,220 --> 01:29:10,803
I'm not looking at you.

1057
01:29:10,888 --> 01:29:12,680
Mind your own business!

1058
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:34,285
Hello?

1059
01:29:34,370 --> 01:29:37,038
Yes, I'm alone.
I'm in a hurry. What is it?

1060
01:29:37,122 --> 01:29:38,623
Alone.

1061
01:29:40,042 --> 01:29:41,501
Alone!

1062
01:29:43,546 --> 01:29:46,506
You're having a fit of jealousy
over the phone?

1063
01:29:48,259 --> 01:29:51,636
Why don't you just tap my phone?

1064
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:56,224
Have me followed.
Hide a camera under my sheets.

1065
01:29:56,600 --> 01:30:00,103
You are in charge of 500 men.
Have me followed.

1066
01:30:00,187 --> 01:30:03,022
Then you'll know
who I see and what I do.

1067
01:30:18,038 --> 01:30:22,208
"I think it's time to end our affair."

1068
01:30:22,876 --> 01:30:26,379
Augusta, you can take
your sappy farewell letter

1069
01:30:26,463 --> 01:30:28,590
and shove it right between your legs!

1070
01:30:29,174 --> 01:30:30,633
You're running away?

1071
01:30:30,718 --> 01:30:33,219
I'm not playing the jealous boyfriend.

1072
01:30:33,304 --> 01:30:35,221
You can do whatever you want.

1073
01:30:35,306 --> 01:30:38,141
You can screw whomever you want.
I don't care.

1074
01:30:38,225 --> 01:30:41,227
But you have to tell me these things.
I want to see him.

1075
01:30:41,312 --> 01:30:43,396
We have to be accomplices.

1076
01:30:43,731 --> 01:30:46,399
You can't do this to me.

1077
01:30:46,483 --> 01:30:48,735
I'm a respectable man.

1078
01:30:49,111 --> 01:30:52,572
I'm somebody.
I represent power, Augusta.

1079
01:30:52,656 --> 01:30:56,784
You should kiss the ground
I walk on, got that, bitch?

1080
01:30:56,869 --> 01:30:59,329
Who is this Pace? Bitch!

1081
01:30:59,413 --> 01:31:02,624
He's a friend of mine who lives upstairs.

1082
01:31:02,708 --> 01:31:06,085
Young, handsome and a revolutionary.

1083
01:31:06,545 --> 01:31:07,712
A revolutionary!

1084
01:31:07,796 --> 01:31:12,383
- I'll hurt you!
- Get your hands off me, idiot!

1085
01:31:13,093 --> 01:31:16,220
You're not at the station.
You're in my house!

1086
01:31:16,305 --> 01:31:17,597
Get out!

1087
01:31:17,681 --> 01:31:21,309
I'm not one of those poor saps
who fall into your hands, got it?

1088
01:31:21,393 --> 01:31:24,562
You make love like a child
because that's what you are!

1089
01:31:24,647 --> 01:31:26,397
- Who do you think you are?
- Don't yell.

1090
01:31:26,482 --> 01:31:31,069
I bet you still wet your bed!
You're nobody, nobody!

1091
01:31:31,153 --> 01:31:35,823
You're incompetent,
sexually incompetent.

1092
01:31:35,908 --> 01:31:37,408
- Do you understand?
- Don't hit me!

1093
01:31:37,493 --> 01:31:39,494
- You're incompetent.
- Don't hit me!

1094
01:31:39,578 --> 01:31:41,788
You're a child, understand?

1095
01:31:41,872 --> 01:31:44,749
You're a child!

1096
01:31:45,751 --> 01:31:49,253
Don't stand. Stay seated.

1097
01:31:52,257 --> 01:31:53,216
Nice sunset.

1098
01:31:53,300 --> 01:31:57,512
- We've been on our feet for 16 hours.
- We'll send you back to the barracks soon.

1099
01:31:57,596 --> 01:31:59,263
We're exhausted.

1100
01:31:59,598 --> 01:32:02,141
- Here.
- Long live the Cultural Revolution!

1101
01:32:07,439 --> 01:32:10,858
Chief, they have the same names
they did 30 years ago.

1102
01:32:11,694 --> 01:32:14,278
Revolution is like syphilis.
It's in their blood.

1103
01:32:14,363 --> 01:32:15,530
- Good evening.
- Evening.

1104
01:32:15,614 --> 01:32:17,532
Evening, Chief.
We can't take this much longer.

1105
01:32:17,616 --> 01:32:19,534
What a pain!

1106
01:32:19,618 --> 01:32:21,244
Murderers! Fascists!

1107
01:32:21,328 --> 01:32:24,789
Fascists! Fascists!

1108
01:32:35,217 --> 01:32:36,968
Spontaneists!

1109
01:32:37,052 --> 01:32:38,636
Spontaneists!

1110
01:32:43,642 --> 01:32:45,393
Even in jail, they fight.

1111
01:32:45,477 --> 01:32:48,104
In two hours, they've already
split up into four groups.

1112
01:32:48,188 --> 01:32:50,231
It's like a chain reaction.

1113
01:32:50,315 --> 01:32:53,234
It's a good thing they're not united,
or we'd have trouble.

1114
01:32:53,527 --> 01:32:55,653
I want to question Antonio Pace.
He has training.

1115
01:32:55,738 --> 01:32:59,907
But first send me the guy next to him,
the one shouting a lot, with the mustache.

1116
01:32:59,992 --> 01:33:01,951
That's what you are!

1117
01:33:02,453 --> 01:33:05,997
Servants of the man!
Servants of the man!

1118
01:33:14,006 --> 01:33:17,383
Hands off the floor!

1119
01:33:18,302 --> 01:33:22,513
Your entire weight
needs to be on your knees.

1120
01:33:23,432 --> 01:33:27,185
You're not a horse
who walks on all fours!

1121
01:33:29,605 --> 01:33:32,982
You're a citizen of a democracy,
not a horse.

1122
01:33:33,066 --> 01:33:35,318
You're not a horse!

1123
01:33:35,402 --> 01:33:36,903
What do you prefer?

1124
01:33:36,987 --> 01:33:41,115
Another quart of salt water
or staying on your knees?

1125
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:43,201
I don't know. You decide.

1126
01:33:44,536 --> 01:33:47,747
If you decide to get up,
you'd better drink all of it.

1127
01:33:48,916 --> 01:33:51,334
You'd better drink all of it.

1128
01:33:53,378 --> 01:33:55,004
All of it.

1129
01:33:55,422 --> 01:33:58,174
Nothing.
Get back on your knees.

1130
01:33:59,885 --> 01:34:01,928
You shouldn't have drunk any of it.

1131
01:34:03,764 --> 01:34:09,352
You could leave here within 10 minutes
and drink your fill of fresh, pure water.

1132
01:34:09,436 --> 01:34:12,021
Clear, sweet, fresh water.

1133
01:34:12,105 --> 01:34:13,815
Student.

1134
01:34:14,149 --> 01:34:17,068
I don't want to put you on trial.

1135
01:34:17,152 --> 01:34:19,987
We're not the KGB or the SS.

1136
01:34:20,072 --> 01:34:22,615
We are the police of a democracy.

1137
01:34:22,699 --> 01:34:26,953
We're overjoyed when we can spare
a citizen a harsh sentence.

1138
01:34:27,871 --> 01:34:30,915
You're only a kid.
I don't want to ruin your future.

1139
01:34:34,628 --> 01:34:36,128
Sit up straight!

1140
01:34:36,213 --> 01:34:39,966
You can be a Marxist,
an anarchist, a situationist.

1141
01:34:40,050 --> 01:34:42,218
Mao, Lin Biao.

1142
01:34:42,302 --> 01:34:46,722
You can read the Little Red Book,
do whatever you want.

1143
01:34:46,807 --> 01:34:48,891
You're not a horse!

1144
01:34:48,976 --> 01:34:52,603
You're a citizen of this democracy,

1145
01:34:52,688 --> 01:34:54,897
and I have to respect you.

1146
01:34:55,983 --> 01:34:58,609
But terrorist attacks,

1147
01:34:59,611 --> 01:35:01,863
intimidation,

1148
01:35:02,114 --> 01:35:04,031
and bombs

1149
01:35:04,116 --> 01:35:08,578
have fuck-all to do with democracy!

1150
01:35:11,665 --> 01:35:15,626
If you tell me who bombed the police station
and the American Express office,

1151
01:35:16,295 --> 01:35:18,379
you'd be acting like a true democrat,
understand?

1152
01:35:18,463 --> 01:35:20,172
That's logical.

1153
01:35:20,257 --> 01:35:22,174
I know it wasn't you.

1154
01:35:23,468 --> 01:35:29,056
But I'm sure you know the name
of the guilty party.

1155
01:35:29,808 --> 01:35:31,851
Please give me some water.

1156
01:35:33,979 --> 01:35:37,398
We don't want you to rat out your friends.

1157
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:41,402
We want you to act like a true democrat.

1158
01:35:43,822 --> 01:35:47,742
You understand me.
Let's talk as modern and civilized men.

1159
01:35:47,826 --> 01:35:50,703
What is this democracy?

1160
01:35:52,831 --> 01:35:55,082
Let's admit it.

1161
01:35:55,876 --> 01:35:58,419
It's the stepping-stone to socialism.

1162
01:35:58,503 --> 01:36:01,839
I vote socialist, for example.

1163
01:36:03,175 --> 01:36:04,967
Don't be afraid.

1164
01:36:05,677 --> 01:36:09,513
I'm your confessor.
Everybody talks here.

1165
01:36:09,598 --> 01:36:11,515
Nothing will happen to you.

1166
01:36:12,267 --> 01:36:14,226
I'm as silent as the grave.

1167
01:36:14,770 --> 01:36:18,397
This whole building is one big grave!

1168
01:36:24,696 --> 01:36:26,948
So, will you tell me the truth?

1169
01:36:27,032 --> 01:36:29,033
Are you going to tell me?

1170
01:36:29,409 --> 01:36:32,411
Will you tell me his name?

1171
01:36:32,496 --> 01:36:34,372
It was Pace!

1172
01:36:34,456 --> 01:36:38,459
Pace planted the bomb
the day he came to the station!

1173
01:36:40,295 --> 01:36:42,213
Did he make the bomb?

1174
01:36:47,970 --> 01:36:50,554
Mattone, bring in Antonio Pace.

1175
01:36:51,723 --> 01:36:53,391
This one's all done.

1176
01:36:54,309 --> 01:36:56,435
Come on. Get up.

1177
01:36:57,312 --> 01:37:00,189
It's all over. You're free.

1178
01:37:00,565 --> 01:37:03,734
If you ever need something,
just call me.

1179
01:37:06,196 --> 01:37:07,905
I didn't mean to.

1180
01:37:08,240 --> 01:37:09,323
I didn't mean to.

1181
01:37:35,934 --> 01:37:39,562
Canes, Mattone, leave us alone.
Go get a coffee.

1182
01:37:39,646 --> 01:37:42,690
Leave me alone with the "comrade."

1183
01:37:42,774 --> 01:37:45,651
One of your friends just denounced you.

1184
01:37:45,736 --> 01:37:48,195
You don't leave prison with a PhD!

1185
01:37:48,447 --> 01:37:50,781
Best case, you leave as a bank robber!

1186
01:37:50,866 --> 01:37:52,575
Pace, Antonio.

1187
01:37:53,035 --> 01:37:56,287
Born in Ravenna, 1946.

1188
01:37:56,371 --> 01:37:58,622
Former chemistry student.

1189
01:37:59,666 --> 01:38:01,959
Independent anarchist.

1190
01:38:03,295 --> 01:38:09,091
Sentenced to three months in jail in 1968
for resisting the police.

1191
01:38:09,176 --> 01:38:11,302
What are you saying?

1192
01:38:13,180 --> 01:38:15,014
Do you know who I am?

1193
01:38:15,098 --> 01:38:18,517
I think you were the lover
of my downstairs neighbor.

1194
01:38:18,602 --> 01:38:20,603
- The one who was murdered.
- By whom and when?

1195
01:38:20,687 --> 01:38:25,941
I think you killed her
the afternoon of Sunday, August 24.

1196
01:38:26,318 --> 01:38:27,943
What time?

1197
01:38:28,487 --> 01:38:32,239
I think you must have killed her
between 5:00 and 7:00 p.m.

1198
01:38:32,949 --> 01:38:35,367
That's when we met
at the gate, as you know.

1199
01:38:35,452 --> 01:38:39,288
Since you're so sure I did it,
turn me in.

1200
01:38:39,956 --> 01:38:41,665
- You'd like that, huh?
- Turn me in!

1201
01:38:41,750 --> 01:38:46,545
You're here and that's where you'll stay.
A criminal leading the repression.

1202
01:38:46,630 --> 01:38:48,756
- It's perfect! It's perfect!
- Turn me in!

1203
01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:51,258
You have to turn me in!

1204
01:38:51,343 --> 01:38:54,011
I made a mistake,
but I want to pay for it.

1205
01:38:54,096 --> 01:38:56,263
Stop yelling!

1206
01:38:56,348 --> 01:38:57,932
Do your job.

1207
01:38:58,850 --> 01:39:01,685
- You have to turn me in because I'm...
- You turn me in!

1208
01:39:02,938 --> 01:39:04,647
Open up!

1209
01:39:05,065 --> 01:39:08,234
Next time we plan something,
I'll call you.

1210
01:39:08,318 --> 01:39:10,194
You're mine now!

1211
01:39:10,278 --> 01:39:12,863
Come back here.
You're acting like a child.

1212
01:39:12,948 --> 01:39:16,659
Let's discuss this.
Please, let's be sensible.

1213
01:39:17,119 --> 01:39:19,662
- I want out. Let me go.
- Stop him.

1214
01:39:20,705 --> 01:39:23,958
It's nothing.
Let him go. Let him go.

1215
01:39:24,042 --> 01:39:26,710
It's nothing. Let him go.

1216
01:39:31,758 --> 01:39:34,093
The student.

1217
01:39:37,931 --> 01:39:40,307
"You're mine now."

1218
01:39:48,483 --> 01:39:50,025
HOMICIDE DIVISION

1219
01:39:52,696 --> 01:39:54,196
How are you?

1220
01:40:27,772 --> 01:40:30,900
Did they call you in
for the Botta case too?

1221
01:40:31,651 --> 01:40:33,736
No, I'm here for the Terzi case.

1222
01:40:33,820 --> 01:40:36,572
The gorgeous woman
who was killed with a razor?

1223
01:40:36,656 --> 01:40:40,284
Shut up.
I told you both to shut up.

1224
01:40:41,953 --> 01:40:43,704
Hello, Chief.

1225
01:40:45,707 --> 01:40:48,334
- How's everything?
- Great.

1226
01:40:48,877 --> 01:40:52,213
- Pallottella?
- Present.

1227
01:40:52,297 --> 01:40:54,298
It's your turn. Come in.

1228
01:40:54,382 --> 01:40:56,717
Wait. I'll go first.

1229
01:40:57,677 --> 01:40:59,595
Pallottella, let's go.

1230
01:41:04,142 --> 01:41:05,768
Close the door.

1231
01:41:10,899 --> 01:41:12,399
Come on, Pallottella.

1232
01:41:12,484 --> 01:41:15,819
Come forward,
you little kiss-ass.

1233
01:41:16,029 --> 01:41:19,281
Move it, you son of a bitch,
piece of shit.

1234
01:41:20,367 --> 01:41:23,994
You little bureaucrat, playing cop.

1235
01:41:24,412 --> 01:41:28,415
You'll never understand
the full significance of my actions,

1236
01:41:28,500 --> 01:41:30,125
of my sacrifice,

1237
01:41:30,210 --> 01:41:36,590
with which I hope to reaffirm,
in all its purity, the concept of authority.

1238
01:41:36,675 --> 01:41:39,134
- Morons!
- What did I do?

1239
01:41:39,219 --> 01:41:42,846
I'm handing Augusta Terzi's
murderer over to you.

1240
01:41:43,974 --> 01:41:44,932
Thank you.

1241
01:41:45,016 --> 01:41:48,852
Starting now,
I'm at justice's disposal.

1242
01:41:49,813 --> 01:41:52,439
When you wish to interrogate me,
you'll find me at home.

1243
01:42:03,076 --> 01:42:05,286
- These things happen.
- Well, they shouldn't.

1244
01:42:05,370 --> 01:42:08,914
Don't worry. You'll be back
at home before the morning's out.

1245
01:42:08,999 --> 01:42:10,499
We'll see.

1246
01:42:12,002 --> 01:42:14,420
- This way, please.
- Sir.

1247
01:42:17,090 --> 01:42:20,092
From now on, you can safely
tell them you recognize me.

1248
01:42:20,719 --> 01:42:23,220
I don't recognize you.

1249
01:42:24,389 --> 01:42:27,474
I don't recognize anyone!

1250
01:42:27,559 --> 01:42:30,019
Help!
I don't recognize anyone!

1251
01:42:30,228 --> 01:42:31,312
No! Help!

1252
01:42:31,396 --> 01:42:33,063
What have you done?

1253
01:42:33,565 --> 01:42:35,316
What have you done?

1254
01:42:35,400 --> 01:42:38,360
What about us?
What about your colleagues?

1255
01:42:38,862 --> 01:42:40,863
Do your duty.

1256
01:43:19,444 --> 01:43:21,779
"Article 247:

1257
01:43:22,655 --> 01:43:26,533
Cases in which house arrest
may be authorized.

1258
01:43:27,035 --> 01:43:29,453
When the circumstances of the crime

1259
01:43:29,996 --> 01:43:33,540
and the high moral character
of the prisoner so allow,

1260
01:43:34,292 --> 01:43:36,794
the district attorney...

1261
01:43:38,671 --> 01:43:44,218
or the judge may make
the following justifiable decree.

1262
01:43:44,302 --> 01:43:45,302
THE PENAL CODE

1263
01:43:45,387 --> 01:43:47,221
instead of being incarcerated in prison,

1264
01:43:47,305 --> 01:43:53,685
the prisoner may remain
temporarily under arrest

1265
01:43:54,229 --> 01:43:56,438
in his own home."

1266

HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA

1267
01:44:27,011 --> 01:44:29,513
The Dean of the University of Messina
hereby confers...

1268
01:44:47,782 --> 01:44:49,283
Chief?

1269
01:44:49,868 --> 01:44:52,119
They're in the other room.

1270
01:44:53,163 --> 01:44:54,538
Come.

1271
01:45:16,686 --> 01:45:18,228
Sir.

1272
01:45:18,730 --> 01:45:20,564
Excellency.

1273
01:45:37,165 --> 01:45:38,749
Excellency.

1274
01:45:39,501 --> 01:45:43,045
I'm sorry to have inconvenienced
so many important people.

1275
01:45:43,838 --> 01:45:45,589
Eat this salt.

1276
01:45:55,266 --> 01:45:56,934
Where were you, dear colleague,

1277
01:45:57,018 --> 01:46:02,856
between 3:00 and 7:00 p.m.
the day of Augusta Terzi's murder?

1278
01:46:02,941 --> 01:46:04,775
Excellency, gentlemen,

1279
01:46:05,443 --> 01:46:07,528
I was there because I killed her.

1280
01:46:07,612 --> 01:46:09,988
Can you prove you were at her house?

1281
01:46:10,073 --> 01:46:12,366
I have some bad news.

1282
01:46:12,450 --> 01:46:14,117
There is a witness.

1283
01:46:14,202 --> 01:46:18,205
Unfortunately, the student Antonio Pace,
a notorious subversive,

1284
01:46:18,289 --> 01:46:20,082
saw me enter the building.

1285
01:46:20,166 --> 01:46:21,792
That's not true.

1286
01:46:22,377 --> 01:46:26,421
The student Antonio Pace
has a watertight alibi.

1287
01:46:26,506 --> 01:46:28,090
He wasn't in Rome that afternoon.

1288
01:46:28,174 --> 01:46:30,467
I questioned him for hours,
my dear colleague,

1289
01:46:30,552 --> 01:46:32,386
and I did it my way!

1290
01:46:32,637 --> 01:46:38,684
Excellency, the bloody footprints
discovered in Augusta Terzi's apartment.

1291
01:46:38,768 --> 01:46:43,272
Not to interfere in the investigation,
but they came from my left shoe.

1292
01:46:43,356 --> 01:46:45,065
My dear friend,

1293
01:46:45,316 --> 01:46:49,861
there are thousands of shoes
of that size and model.

1294
01:46:51,781 --> 01:46:54,032
I own a pair that's identical.

1295
01:46:55,410 --> 01:46:57,286
- So do I.
- Perhaps.

1296
01:46:57,370 --> 01:47:01,248
But I left fingerprints
all over her apartment,

1297
01:47:01,583 --> 01:47:03,375
even on the shower faucet.

1298
01:47:03,459 --> 01:47:06,336
Because, gentlemen, Excellency,

1299
01:47:06,421 --> 01:47:08,922
I took a shower afterwards.

1300
01:47:09,007 --> 01:47:09,965
Strange.

1301
01:47:10,049 --> 01:47:14,511
Everyone left fingerprints on the faucets,
cups and door handles, except for you.

1302
01:47:14,596 --> 01:47:20,350
Yes, but the blue thread discovered
under her fingernail comes from my tie.

1303
01:47:20,435 --> 01:47:23,520
So, give us the tie
with the missing thread.

1304
01:47:23,605 --> 01:47:25,606
- I destroyed it.
- Why?

1305
01:47:26,316 --> 01:47:31,278
In that moment I was torn between
confessing and putting you on my trail

1306
01:47:31,362 --> 01:47:35,365
or using the little bit of power
I had to cover up my trail.

1307
01:47:35,450 --> 01:47:38,243
A split personality, dissociation.

1308
01:47:38,870 --> 01:47:39,828
Neurosis.

1309
01:47:39,912 --> 01:47:45,876
A disease I probably contracted
from my prolonged exercise of power.

1310
01:47:46,252 --> 01:47:48,045
It's an occupational disease,

1311
01:47:48,129 --> 01:47:54,468
common to those who hold the reins
of our helpless little society in their hands.

1312
01:47:54,552 --> 01:47:56,136
I'm healthy.

1313
01:47:56,220 --> 01:47:57,679
Enough psychology!

1314
01:47:57,764 --> 01:48:01,475
We need tangible proof of your guilt.

1315
01:48:01,726 --> 01:48:03,894
Not just words, but facts.

1316
01:48:03,978 --> 01:48:09,149
I made that poor idiot we arrested
buy those 25 blue ties.

1317
01:48:09,233 --> 01:48:11,318
That's not true.
He didn't recognize you.

1318
01:48:12,362 --> 01:48:14,738
Yes, but we can admit
what happened, between us.

1319
01:48:14,822 --> 01:48:18,241
He denied it out of fear
when he started to realize who I was,

1320
01:48:18,326 --> 01:48:20,202
a police officer.

1321
01:48:20,286 --> 01:48:23,664
I will not tolerate these
opinions and insinuations

1322
01:48:23,748 --> 01:48:25,415
against your colleagues,
the force, our institution!

1323
01:48:25,500 --> 01:48:27,501
Let's talk specifics.

1324
01:48:27,835 --> 01:48:29,336
Your motive.

1325
01:48:29,629 --> 01:48:33,048
- What was your motive?
- She made fun of me!

1326
01:48:33,132 --> 01:48:36,760
She made fun of me and our institution!

1327
01:48:36,844 --> 01:48:38,345
Our institution!

1328
01:48:38,429 --> 01:48:40,722
That means all of you, gentlemen!

1329
01:48:40,807 --> 01:48:43,433
That's not a demonstrable motive.

1330
01:48:45,728 --> 01:48:47,479
Please excuse me, Excellency.

1331
01:48:47,563 --> 01:48:50,774
Gentlemen, excuse me.
This is private.

1332
01:48:51,109 --> 01:48:52,609
It won't take long.

1333
01:48:53,695 --> 01:48:56,113
I rely on your discretion, Excellency.

1334
01:48:56,197 --> 01:48:58,740
Every day that I was with her,

1335
01:48:59,075 --> 01:49:02,202
my childishness and my inadequacies
became more and more apparent.

1336
01:49:02,286 --> 01:49:04,705
Absurd! Impossible!
Science fiction!

1337
01:49:07,625 --> 01:49:09,960
Well, then, I murdered her
out of pure jealousy!

1338
01:49:10,044 --> 01:49:12,879
- You didn't know her.
- Go on. Prove it.

1339
01:49:12,964 --> 01:49:15,549
She wasn't your mistress.
Nobody ever saw you together.

1340
01:49:15,633 --> 01:49:16,675
That's right.

1341
01:49:16,759 --> 01:49:19,094
Just a moment, gentlemen.

1342
01:49:20,430 --> 01:49:23,890
I'll bring you the evidence of my guilt.

1343
01:49:23,975 --> 01:49:25,892
Just a moment, gentlemen.

1344
01:49:26,477 --> 01:49:28,437
I'll be right back.

1345
01:49:31,816 --> 01:49:34,151
You killed a worthless person.

1346
01:49:34,652 --> 01:49:36,278
Someone else would have killed me.

1347
01:49:36,362 --> 01:49:38,947
Sooner or later,
I was destined to die that way.

1348
01:49:39,449 --> 01:49:41,241
Do what they tell you.

1349
01:49:41,325 --> 01:49:43,076
Think of your colleagues.

1350
01:49:43,161 --> 01:49:45,162
Think of your career.

1351
01:49:45,997 --> 01:49:48,248
Excellency, gentlemen,

1352
01:49:48,332 --> 01:49:52,252
these photos prove the victim
was photographed right here.

1353
01:49:52,336 --> 01:49:54,588
Check the furniture, the floor.

1354
01:49:54,672 --> 01:49:57,674
Here the victim strikes erotic poses

1355
01:49:57,759 --> 01:50:01,261
that perversely imitate crime photos!

1356
01:50:01,345 --> 01:50:03,930
I exploited the situation
for my love of amateur photography!

1357
01:50:04,015 --> 01:50:07,642
Disgusting!
Look what we've come to.

1358
01:50:07,727 --> 01:50:10,312
I'm at my wit's end.

1359
01:50:10,396 --> 01:50:11,938
He's an immature child.

1360
01:50:12,023 --> 01:50:14,441
I always said he had no team spirit.

1361
01:50:14,525 --> 01:50:17,486
- See what things have come to?
- I'll petition the court!

1362
01:50:17,570 --> 01:50:19,446
Here's to your health.

1363
01:50:20,865 --> 01:50:22,491
I'll do whatever you want.

1364
01:50:28,873 --> 01:50:31,666
Well done, son.

1365
01:50:32,210 --> 01:50:34,461
Do you have anything to say?

1366
01:50:34,545 --> 01:50:36,838
I confess to my innocence.

1367
01:50:38,716 --> 01:50:41,635
Now sign here.

1368
01:50:43,721 --> 01:50:45,388
Everything's all right.
Calm down.

1369
01:51:02,406 --> 01:51:04,825
Gentlemen, colleagues,

1370
01:51:04,909 --> 01:51:08,411
let's not forget there's still an enemy
out there who knows the facts.

1371
01:51:09,247 --> 01:51:11,498
He'll use them not only against me,

1372
01:51:11,582 --> 01:51:13,166
but against all of us,

1373
01:51:13,751 --> 01:51:16,503
against power, against God!

1374
01:51:16,587 --> 01:51:18,839
That's a score we'll have to settle.

1375
01:53:32,723 --> 01:53:34,057
Come in.

1376
01:53:34,141 --> 01:53:35,725
Make yourselves comfortable, gentlemen.

1377
01:54:15,474 --> 01:54:17,559
"No matter what impression he makes on us,

1378
01:54:17,643 --> 01:54:19,352
he is a servant of the law.

1379
01:54:19,437 --> 01:54:21,021
Therefore, he belongs to the law

1380
01:54:21,105 --> 01:54:23,189
and does not answer to human judgment."
