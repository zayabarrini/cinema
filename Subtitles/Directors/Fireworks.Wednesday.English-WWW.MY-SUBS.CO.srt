1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,120
<i>In the name of God</i>

2
00:00:16,571 --> 00:00:21,506
Look at you!
What in the world are you looking at?

3
00:00:21,676 --> 00:00:24,025
Can't check out my own fiance?

4
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,333
Put it away, it's embarrassing!

5
00:00:28,217 --> 00:00:32,993
- This one is nice. - Which one?
- The one we took on your roof.

6
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,826
What class!

7
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:38,545
What class!

8
00:00:44,488 --> 00:00:47,391
- Was that your foot?
- No, it was my chador.

9
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:54,974
I've told you 100 times! Hold onto
your chador! Now what do do?

10
00:00:55,135 --> 00:00:56,008
Okay...

11
00:00:57,249 --> 00:00:58,916
Be careful, you'll rip it.

12
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:14,507
There's nobody here at this hour.

13
00:01:14,677 --> 00:01:17,343
- Who are you hiding from?
- From you!

14
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:16,051
- Don't go too fast!
- Alright. Go in already!

15
00:02:16,571 --> 00:02:18,793
- Hi!
- Hello, beautiful bride-to-be!

16
00:02:18,963 --> 00:02:20,711
- Are there many people?
- Lots.

17
00:02:24,346 --> 00:02:25,482
Hitchhiking on that
road is pretty shady.

18
00:02:25,483 --> 00:02:26,616
Especially for a girl.

19
00:02:26,778 --> 00:02:29,287
- They'll find her.
- Find her? Right, dream on.

20
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,238
- Wasn't expecting you.
- There wasn't much snow.

21
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,547
You need money to get married.

22
00:02:34,717 --> 00:02:37,165
If our pay was enough
to get married with,

23
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:39,615
would've done it
100 times already!

24
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:43,130
You've already buried
three husbands!

25
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:46,319
- Didn't take any from you.
- Be my guest!

26
00:02:49,272 --> 00:02:50,463
Well, goodbye.

27
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:53,577
Hurry up,
have to get back early.

28
00:02:53,818 --> 00:02:56,847
- Sit down, I'm going to try.
- Thank you.

29
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,384
I've brought it for you.
Do you want to try it on?

30
00:03:05,502 --> 00:03:10,359
- Is it our turn yet?
- So, which one of the two should go?

31
00:03:10,806 --> 00:03:13,711
Find a job for my wife and me.

32
00:03:15,113 --> 00:03:17,258
- Hi, granny.
- Hello.

33
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:50,522
Wait!

34
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:55,307
Where are you?
Congratulations.

35
00:03:55,752 --> 00:03:58,054
- When is it for?
- Next Friday.

36
00:03:58,224 --> 00:04:01,445
You'll have it by Thursday
and pay what you can.

37
00:04:01,614 --> 00:04:03,360
Thanks a lot.

38
00:04:06,678 --> 00:04:09,106
- Pick any one.
- Are you kidding me?

39
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,018
I'm serious. Go on.

40
00:04:14,256 --> 00:04:17,601
- This one.
- Let me see. Heravi Square.

41
00:04:17,884 --> 00:04:20,595
- It's too far.
- The others are worse.

42
00:04:20,755 --> 00:04:22,866
- Show me.
- Go on.

43
00:04:24,225 --> 00:04:28,003
- Don't come back late.
- You got it. See you later.

44
00:07:01,233 --> 00:07:04,217
- Who is it?
- Excuse me, ma'am.

45
00:07:04,384 --> 00:07:08,046
Your neighbors aren't answering.
Do you know where they are?

46
00:07:08,331 --> 00:07:10,045
<i>Their buzzer's broken. You are...</i>

47
00:07:10,206 --> 00:07:12,872
I'm here to work for them.
Could you let me in?

48
00:07:13,037 --> 00:07:16,940
<i>I'll call them
and they'll let you in themselves.</i>

49
00:07:23,007 --> 00:07:24,719
- Give me the fish.
- Mom!

50
00:07:25,001 --> 00:07:26,907
Be good!
Hurry up!

51
00:07:29,507 --> 00:07:31,413
Be careful, you'll fall.

52
00:07:37,005 --> 00:07:38,514
Where are you going?

53
00:07:39,198 --> 00:07:41,864
- Are you looking for someone?
- Apartment 17.

54
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:46,091
- Buzz and they'll let you in.
- It's already open.

55
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:50,317
Don't know what you're doing here.
Go on. Step outside.

56
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:17,392
Hold on.

57
00:08:20,594 --> 00:08:22,182
- Hello.
- Hello, come in.

58
00:08:22,348 --> 00:08:24,413
Swear, have the tickets already.

59
00:08:24,581 --> 00:08:28,087
You don't know how long I've
wanted to go away with my family.

60
00:08:28,649 --> 00:08:30,873
Yeah, right...
Leave me alone!

61
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,374
Fine, okay. Five minutes?

62
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:38,172
Know it'll last until midnight!

63
00:08:42,727 --> 00:08:44,394
Okay. Bye.

64
00:08:47,991 --> 00:08:49,738
Miss?

65
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:56,204
- Yes.
- Stan with this room.

66
00:08:56,645 --> 00:08:59,628
My wife will tell you
what to do afterward

67
00:08:59,795 --> 00:09:01,428
What a mess!

68
00:09:03,346 --> 00:09:05,296
Wait a minute.

69
00:09:07,731 --> 00:09:12,077
Put on these slippers.
There's glass, you might get hurt.

70
00:09:26,476 --> 00:09:31,059
Why do you have my cell?
Why'd you take it?

71
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,922
Have things to do.
have to go.

72
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:38,310
I've been looking for you
for an hour.

73
00:09:38,518 --> 00:09:39,789
When are you coming back?

74
00:09:39,955 --> 00:09:44,776
- Sir? - Hello, yes?
- The broom and dustpan?

75
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,573
Just a second.

76
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:49,723
Over there.

77
00:09:52,715 --> 00:09:57,140
It's the cleaning lady called.
Specialized agencies send them over.

78
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:01,409
So, they'll work together!

79
00:10:36,305 --> 00:10:38,415
She parked in front of the gate again!

80
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:43,381
- You shouldn't have called her.
- My cell?

81
00:10:43,382 --> 00:10:45,753
- The concierge was
going to help me.

82
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:48,287
It's been a damn mess
for three days now.

83
00:10:48,288 --> 00:10:50,657
The concierge, the concierge...

84
00:10:51,739 --> 00:10:54,087
- My phone?
- Where are you going?

85
00:10:54,252 --> 00:10:57,121
- Give it to me, have to run.
- Run where?

86
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,669
- To work. What do you think?
- Today?

87
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:03,810
Mahmud called.
They have some problems.

88
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:08,124
- We were supposed to talk.
- I'll be back. I'm not running away.

89
00:11:10,163 --> 00:11:12,227
You said we'd talk it over today.

90
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:17,454
Know did,
but that damn Mahmud needs me.

91
00:11:17,859 --> 00:11:21,557
Don't worry, I'll be back by 5
and we'll take care of everything.

92
00:11:21,728 --> 00:11:25,631
- You said that this morning!
- Yes, did say that. You're right!

93
00:11:25,796 --> 00:11:27,622
But they need me.

94
00:11:27,789 --> 00:11:30,694
That's just great!
You always have time for Mahmud!

95
00:11:31,499 --> 00:11:35,163
- Amir-Ali's not home. - And, so?
- don't want to talk in front of him.

96
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:38,787
What's the problem of talking
in front of him?

97
00:11:39,195 --> 00:11:41,465
We have to make a decision.

98
00:11:41,628 --> 00:11:43,738
Decide for yourself.
I've already decided.

99
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:46,251
Then I'm not going tomorrow.

100
00:11:48,568 --> 00:11:51,154
What are you saying?
Mojdeh?

101
00:11:52,316 --> 00:11:55,980
Listen. have the tickets.
I'm not your puppet.

102
00:11:56,144 --> 00:11:58,969
You promised.
Don't go back on your word.

103
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,687
All promised you
was a trip to Dubai.

104
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,116
Kept my promise,
you're full of shit!

105
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,991
- Watch your language.
- Look who's talking.

106
00:12:07,151 --> 00:12:10,418
The guy begged me
to come and help him.

107
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:13,087
It's urgent and you want me to stay.

108
00:12:13,253 --> 00:12:15,634
- Didn't say anything.
- Yesterday, you said enough.

109
00:12:15,805 --> 00:12:17,472
You're the one who said too much.

110
00:12:19,474 --> 00:12:21,346
You so damn neurotic!

111
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:24,653
Idiot.

112
00:12:26,653 --> 00:12:28,241
Wait.

113
00:12:29,484 --> 00:12:34,746
I'm speaking to you. If you leave,
I'll take Amir-Ali and go.

114
00:12:34,908 --> 00:12:37,130
- You're a disgrace!
- Disgrace! I'm not moving

115
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:42,315
Wait! swear I'll take him away.
Why won't you understand?

116
00:12:59,274 --> 00:13:00,987
Mrs. Sabri?

117
00:13:12,514 --> 00:13:15,180
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hello. Call your wife.

118
00:13:15,346 --> 00:13:18,613
- She won't be long.
- She was supposed to help me.

119
00:13:18,776 --> 00:13:21,027
- She's out shopping
for the Razavi family.

120
00:13:21,028 --> 00:13:23,279
- Tell her to come see me.

121
00:13:23,441 --> 00:13:26,232
The management won't allow
my wife to work.

122
00:13:26,393 --> 00:13:28,422
It's none of their business.

123
00:13:28,945 --> 00:13:34,129
When she works, take care of the kids.
They say it keeps me from my work.

124
00:13:34,288 --> 00:13:37,669
Tell her to come up.
I'll take care of it.

125
00:13:50,878 --> 00:13:53,465
- Is your mother home?
- Yes, come in.

126
00:13:54,787 --> 00:13:56,613
Mom, it's Mrs. Samii.

127
00:14:03,999 --> 00:14:06,143
Mojdeh, dear, come in!

128
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:10,648
- Thanks. ls Sabri here?
- No, why?

129
00:14:10,818 --> 00:14:13,167
- She was supposed to help me.

130
00:14:13,168 --> 00:14:15,514
- The management doesn't
want her to work.

131
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:18,635
Tell her to see me
when she finishes your shopping.

132
00:14:18,795 --> 00:14:21,936
- Let's keep this between us.
- Okay.

133
00:14:22,104 --> 00:14:24,929
They talked about her
in the meeting.

134
00:14:26,651 --> 00:14:28,239
Well? What happened?

135
00:14:28,406 --> 00:14:32,025
They're going to tell the landlord
to take care of it.

136
00:14:34,148 --> 00:14:37,336
Don't worry about it.
We know nothing. Come in.

137
00:14:37,498 --> 00:14:40,958
- Have to run. Tell her to come up.
- Bye.

138
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,657
Hello, ma'am.

139
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,212
I'm looking for bleach.

140
00:15:05,853 --> 00:15:07,123
Come here.

141
00:15:08,963 --> 00:15:11,028
Didn't see any in the kitchen.

142
00:15:11,755 --> 00:15:15,101
I'm going to do the dishes
in the bathtub.

143
00:15:15,266 --> 00:15:18,486
That way, I'll make some room here.

144
00:15:18,655 --> 00:15:21,558
It's okay. Thanks a lot.

145
00:15:22,283 --> 00:15:25,902
- How much do owe you?
- What? haven't even started yet!

146
00:15:26,351 --> 00:15:28,620
Know. Someone's
coming by to help.

147
00:15:28,783 --> 00:15:33,162
- Then why did you call the agency?
- My husband did.

148
00:15:33,329 --> 00:15:38,185
- What difference does that make?
- don't owe you an explanation.

149
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:40,346
- I'm sorry.
- I've changed my mind.

150
00:15:40,509 --> 00:15:43,083
Didn't go through your drawer.

151
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:46,253
Was cleaning in the
room and it just fell out.

152
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:48,358
Will five thousand Tomans do?

153
00:15:49,602 --> 00:15:53,469
Five thousand? But why?
came all this way!

154
00:15:53,868 --> 00:15:55,739
It's not enough? How much then?

155
00:15:55,902 --> 00:16:00,326
Can't accept this money
when didn't do anything.

156
00:16:01,325 --> 00:16:05,625
Take it. Someone else
is coming to do it.

157
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:09,816
Did do something wrong?
What happened?

158
00:16:10,099 --> 00:16:12,131
No. Are you going
to take it or what?

159
00:16:12,611 --> 00:16:14,836
She has three days of work here.

160
00:16:15,005 --> 00:16:17,465
- Don't care.
- I'll help you.

161
00:16:19,471 --> 00:16:21,774
You don't want it?
It's up to you.

162
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:35,818
Close the door behind you.

163
00:16:48,025 --> 00:16:51,530
- Yes?
- Why isn't anyone answering?

164
00:16:51,695 --> 00:16:56,991
- Their buzzer doesn't work.
- Fix it. You're wasting people's time!

165
00:17:02,701 --> 00:17:04,890
- Yes?
- There's a gentleman here for you.

166
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:07,885
- Who is it?
- The glass cutter.

167
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:11,546
Tell him I'm coming.

168
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:16,893
You parked in front of the gate again!

169
00:17:17,058 --> 00:17:20,121
What do you mean?
They want to park a truck?

170
00:17:22,163 --> 00:17:25,383
- Who gave me a flat?
- don't know.

171
00:17:25,552 --> 00:17:28,581
How should know?
Give me the keys.

172
00:17:28,743 --> 00:17:32,201
I'll do it. just want
to see if it's the psycho!

173
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:36,478
- Saw her come in.
- Their buzzer doesn't work.

174
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:38,908
- Forget it.
Are you looking for trouble?

175
00:17:38,909 --> 00:17:41,175
- She doesn't scare me.

176
00:18:00,248 --> 00:18:02,471
Don't forget our New Year's gifts.

177
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:10,789
Mrs. Sami!

178
00:19:14,066 --> 00:19:15,574
Miss?

179
00:19:17,613 --> 00:19:19,328
Someone's calling you.

180
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,148
What's wrong?

181
00:19:29,139 --> 00:19:32,759
- Did anybody call this morning?
- No. Nobody.

182
00:19:33,487 --> 00:19:35,075
When my husband was there?

183
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:37,952
When got there,
he was on the phone.

184
00:19:38,272 --> 00:19:40,303
- Who was it?
- What do you mean?

185
00:19:41,303 --> 00:19:44,446
- What was he saying?
- don't know, ma'am.

186
00:19:50,596 --> 00:19:51,662
Sorry...

187
00:19:56,975 --> 00:19:58,245
Listen!

188
00:19:59,687 --> 00:20:01,320
Come here!

189
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,953
Said come here.

190
00:20:05,509 --> 00:20:07,859
- Who is it?
- Hello, ma'am.

191
00:20:08,023 --> 00:20:09,735
<i>Hello. May he-[0 you?</i>

192
00:20:09,897 --> 00:20:12,687
wanted to make an appointment
at the salon.

193
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:16,276
<i>- Your name?
- Ruhangiz Barati</i>

194
00:20:16,438 --> 00:20:19,421
<i>- Is this your first time?
- Yes.</i>

195
00:20:19,627 --> 00:20:21,374
<i>Who referred you?</i>

196
00:20:24,334 --> 00:20:26,126
Madame Rahimi.

197
00:20:26,287 --> 00:20:29,192
<i>I'm busy now.
Can you this afternoon?</i>

198
00:20:29,677 --> 00:20:33,058
- Around what time?
- 5 p. m.

199
00:20:33,227 --> 00:20:38,127
<i>Otherwise, go for a walk
and come back in 30 minutes.</i>

200
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,537
<i>- What about between 2 and 5?
-  can't; I'll be out.</i>

201
00:20:46,706 --> 00:20:49,259
Okay, well then perhaps
in 30 minutes.

202
00:20:49,816 --> 00:20:52,881
<i>- Thanks, it's very nice.
- You're welcome.</i>

203
00:20:56,795 --> 00:21:00,573
- Was good?
- Yes, thank you.

204
00:21:00,943 --> 00:21:02,768
Thank you, God.

205
00:21:12,149 --> 00:21:14,020
The other one is also ?at.

206
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:16,812
Why is it so expensive?

207
00:21:17,134 --> 00:21:20,560
If you only knew how far
I've come in this cold.

208
00:21:20,723 --> 00:21:23,151
You still haven't taken
the trash down?

209
00:21:23,316 --> 00:21:24,791
You live far from here.

210
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,425
Was busy, I'll do it.

211
00:21:26,586 --> 00:21:29,218
Don't forget our New Year's gifts.

212
00:21:34,721 --> 00:21:38,022
- Should we hang the curtains?
- We can't do it alone.

213
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:44,292
- Why don't you call your husband?
- He doesn't even reach my waist!

214
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:48,674
- What is it?
- New Year's gifts for the kids?

215
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:52,026
Paid twice as much
and you want presents as well?

216
00:21:56,056 --> 00:21:57,883
Why is the water running?

217
00:21:59,366 --> 00:22:02,748
- This bucket is still dirty.
- I'll wash it.

218
00:22:03,036 --> 00:22:05,498
Want the girl to come and help?

219
00:22:06,785 --> 00:22:08,611
Which girl?

220
00:22:09,177 --> 00:22:12,160
- The one that was here.
- The cleaning lady?

221
00:22:15,758 --> 00:22:19,262
- Why is she still here?
- She has an appointment at the salon.

222
00:22:19,866 --> 00:22:23,008
- The salon?
- She's getting married soon.

223
00:22:23,933 --> 00:22:26,315
She's going to have
her eyebrows done.

224
00:22:28,918 --> 00:22:32,378
It's cold outside,
tell her to come up.

225
00:22:33,983 --> 00:22:36,773
Do you know how much
she's going to pay you?

226
00:22:37,532 --> 00:22:39,484
I'm totally lost.

227
00:22:39,646 --> 00:22:43,787
This morning, she gave me five
thousand Tomans and asked me to leave.

228
00:22:44,391 --> 00:22:48,010
- They're strange. Are they fighting?
- We can't take it any more.

229
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:52,082
Last night, her husband went mad
and broke the window.

230
00:22:52,249 --> 00:22:54,199
Saw the broken glass.

231
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,782
It's always the same thing.
Are you afraid with your husband?

232
00:22:58,946 --> 00:23:04,686
- No, he's not at all like that.
- No offense.

233
00:23:05,129 --> 00:23:09,395
- Is your husband like that?
- God forbid! wouldn't say that.

234
00:23:12,189 --> 00:23:15,647
My husband is madly
in love with me!

235
00:23:15,816 --> 00:23:20,116
Nasser, my cousin,
was also in love with me.

236
00:23:22,437 --> 00:23:25,738
- When's it for?
- One more month.

237
00:23:29,814 --> 00:23:31,165
Is it expensive?

238
00:23:32,168 --> 00:23:34,437
- What?
- The hairdresser.

239
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,512
Simine is very fair.

240
00:23:36,674 --> 00:23:39,702
Explain your situation
and she'll charge less.

241
00:23:39,864 --> 00:23:41,770
Why don't you call Mom...

242
00:23:43,334 --> 00:23:46,917
It's ringing.
Hello? Hi Mom. How are you?

243
00:23:47,241 --> 00:23:49,035
- It's Mahdi.
- Is it for me?

244
00:23:55,896 --> 00:24:00,081
- What are you waiting for?
- You knew wouldn't come up

245
00:24:00,244 --> 00:24:04,464
- Hurry, we have lots to do.
- You have to make up with her today.

246
00:24:05,387 --> 00:24:07,497
Okay. Be careful going down.

247
00:24:12,365 --> 00:24:17,347
- Still not finished.
- No need to take off your shoes.

248
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:21,176
- Could've picked you up.
- Ahmad is downstairs.

249
00:24:23,533 --> 00:24:25,961
- Who is that?
- She's helping me.

250
00:24:27,041 --> 00:24:30,468
Ahmad is staying downstairs
like always.

251
00:24:30,631 --> 00:24:33,218
- If it bothers you, get him.
- Me?

252
00:24:33,383 --> 00:24:35,287
It's about time! It's been a year!

253
00:24:36,613 --> 00:24:38,757
He got worked up by himself.
He'll come back when he's ready.

254
00:24:39,245 --> 00:24:40,878
Just like kids!

255
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,913
What's this mess?

256
00:24:43,075 --> 00:24:44,628
Still haven't finished?

257
00:24:44,789 --> 00:24:46,932
Heat it up, we'll eat it.

258
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:51,200
You're the kid.
You never take things seriously.

259
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:53,274
And what about you, Mrs. Serious?

260
00:24:53,642 --> 00:24:57,511
Have you looked in the mirror?
There's a salon next door!

261
00:24:59,265 --> 00:25:03,088
Excuse me. I'd like to get
my husband's permission.

262
00:25:05,127 --> 00:25:07,680
- His permission? - For the salon.
- No need.

263
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,822
She's getting married.
She wants to get her eyebrows done.

264
00:25:11,269 --> 00:25:13,061
Don't tell him everything...
No tea for me.

265
00:25:14,021 --> 00:25:15,813
Surprise him.

266
00:25:16,613 --> 00:25:18,916
Do as you please.

267
00:25:22,276 --> 00:25:23,988
Didn't get any fruit.

268
00:25:24,469 --> 00:25:26,500
<i>You're so busy!</i>

269
00:25:27,022 --> 00:25:30,367
Will you be ready for Dubai,
with this mess?

270
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:33,839
- Ma'am, shouldn't call him?
- It's up to you, he's your husband.

271
00:25:34,001 --> 00:25:36,950
You should've picked
a better country.

272
00:25:37,112 --> 00:25:39,778
- He didn't even want Dubai.
- Why Dubai?

273
00:25:40,023 --> 00:25:42,672
- Think about Amir-Ali.

274
00:25:42,673 --> 00:25:45,320
- Amir-Ali will grow up
like other children.

275
00:25:45,487 --> 00:25:47,391
Anyway, I'm not sure we're leaving.

276
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:49,824
What do you mean, not leaving?

277
00:25:50,032 --> 00:25:54,253
Don't know. We'll see.
Take this when you leave.

278
00:25:54,578 --> 00:25:58,038
- Know how stubborn you can be.
- What do you mean?

279
00:25:58,208 --> 00:26:01,236
You didn't see Amir-Ali sleeping.

280
00:26:02,795 --> 00:26:04,540
You're going to be late.

281
00:26:04,708 --> 00:26:09,767
<i>He was so frightened.
He said he was dreaming about hell.</i>

282
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:14,229
They lectured the kids on hell
at school for an hour.

283
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:18,300
He can't even play
without me keeping an eye on him.

284
00:26:18,467 --> 00:26:20,575
Have to take him to school.

285
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,771
I'm turning it off,
the handles are burning.

286
00:26:22,933 --> 00:26:26,553
- One more window and I'll go.
- You'll miss your appointment.

287
00:26:26,722 --> 00:26:28,911
There's danger everywhere.

288
00:26:29,074 --> 00:26:32,738
I'm always worried
when leave the house.

289
00:26:33,421 --> 00:26:37,368
In fact, one of my co-workers
disappeared the other night.

290
00:26:37,528 --> 00:26:40,796
- Don't tell her where you were.
- Why not?

291
00:26:41,477 --> 00:26:45,538
- Mrs. Rahimi referred you.
- Ah, forgot.

292
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:48,212
You don't need that.
It's right over there.

293
00:26:48,376 --> 00:26:50,883
- Goodbye, ma'am.
- Goodbye.

294
00:26:55,834 --> 00:26:57,580
Why don't you answer?

295
00:26:59,065 --> 00:27:01,368
Don't lie.
What are you doing?

296
00:27:03,331 --> 00:27:07,075
Oh yeah? can see from here.

297
00:27:08,834 --> 00:27:10,390
Listen.

298
00:27:12,424 --> 00:27:14,011
Hello, ma'am.

299
00:27:14,418 --> 00:27:16,245
Come up for a minute.

300
00:27:16,612 --> 00:27:20,479
When do you count on making peace?
They're leaving tomorrow.

301
00:27:31,167 --> 00:27:32,279
What are you doing?

302
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,711
I'm coming.

303
00:27:40,978 --> 00:27:44,040
What's all this about?
What happened this time?

304
00:27:45,723 --> 00:27:49,592
Are you hiding something from me?
Look at me.

305
00:27:54,178 --> 00:27:56,526
- Did Morteza call?

306
00:27:56,527 --> 00:27:58,875
- Poor guy, he was on
the verge of tears.

307
00:27:59,522 --> 00:28:04,741
Why are acting like this?
You're ruining you life!

308
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,373
Mrs. Sabri?

309
00:28:10,091 --> 00:28:12,314
Clean the living room windows first.

310
00:28:12,483 --> 00:28:14,070
Come see.

311
00:28:20,778 --> 00:28:24,761
Mojdeh, you were doing so well
over these past months.

312
00:28:26,002 --> 00:28:27,715
Did something happen?

313
00:28:31,985 --> 00:28:34,095
Didn't know what he was up to!

314
00:28:37,608 --> 00:28:39,750
What are you talking about?
Poor guy!

315
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,381
He works hard day and night
for you and Amir-Ali.

316
00:28:44,029 --> 00:28:45,980
He thinks I'm an idiot.

317
00:28:46,142 --> 00:28:49,204
He's not a fool.
Why would he leave you?

318
00:28:49,372 --> 00:28:51,039
And for whom?

319
00:28:52,763 --> 00:28:56,381
Mojdeh, patience has limits.

320
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:59,853
One day, he'll leave you alone
with your kid.

321
00:29:00,379 --> 00:29:02,046
To hell with him!

322
00:29:04,725 --> 00:29:06,734
Come on. Go make up with Ahmad.

323
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,550
You'll need a place to
stay if you fight with him.

324
00:29:10,507 --> 00:29:12,494
You don't have anyone besides us.

325
00:29:16,449 --> 00:29:20,397
You're the fool!
Such a sweet and kind husband!

326
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:25,221
Don't defend him without
knowing him! know my husband!

327
00:29:31,804 --> 00:29:33,789
Wish Dad was here.

328
00:29:40,818 --> 00:29:42,927
Have you noticed anything recently?

329
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:49,072
- I've heard things.
- From whom?

330
00:29:49,471 --> 00:29:51,026
What difference does it make?

331
00:29:51,186 --> 00:29:55,169
You want to ruin you life
because of gossip?

332
00:29:55,334 --> 00:29:59,234
It's one of our neighbors.
She heard Morteza's voice

333
00:29:59,401 --> 00:30:02,191
on that bitch's answering machine.

334
00:30:04,744 --> 00:30:06,650
Maybe she made a mistake.

335
00:30:10,487 --> 00:30:14,071
- I'm sure of it.
- How can you be sure?

336
00:30:17,747 --> 00:30:20,331
He smells like her perfume.

337
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,429
That's all you needed.

338
00:30:29,072 --> 00:30:33,371
And with someone here!
Behind these walls, under my nose.

339
00:30:36,808 --> 00:30:39,553
Try to think
about your trip tomorrow.

340
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:43,300
Leave all this till
after the holidays.

341
00:30:45,303 --> 00:30:48,047
Darling, don't get all worked up.

342
00:30:48,214 --> 00:30:52,955
- Have to settle this tonight.
- What are you going to do tonight?

343
00:30:55,471 --> 00:30:58,059
Your brother-in-law keeps honking.

344
00:30:58,223 --> 00:31:01,603
- Go, he's waiting for you.
- can't leave you like this.

345
00:31:02,251 --> 00:31:04,804
Go on.

346
00:31:04,964 --> 00:31:07,516
Don't get yourself all worked up.

347
00:31:07,675 --> 00:31:09,389
It'll be fine.

348
00:31:11,384 --> 00:31:13,131
Give me a kiss.

349
00:31:14,814 --> 00:31:18,002
- Happy New Year, anyway.
- Thanks.

350
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:33,117
- What's wrong with you?
- I've been waiting an hour for you!

351
00:31:43,926 --> 00:31:48,782
You have good taste. can see
he's mischievous. Isn't he?

352
00:31:49,071 --> 00:31:52,496
It took my father two years
to accept this marriage.

353
00:31:55,052 --> 00:31:58,353
He was so persistent,
my dad finally accepted.

354
00:31:58,522 --> 00:32:02,549
- Hair colon'?
- No. That would be too much for him!

355
00:32:04,025 --> 00:32:05,773
Does he love you?

356
00:32:07,137 --> 00:32:08,691
Let me see.

357
00:32:11,604 --> 00:32:13,191
Do you like it?

358
00:32:13,916 --> 00:32:15,424
Thank you so much.

359
00:32:15,591 --> 00:32:17,893
- Tea?
- I'll make it.

360
00:32:18,063 --> 00:32:20,854
Since when do customers make tea?

361
00:32:36,768 --> 00:32:41,305
- Ma'am'? - Yes.
- What's your perfume?

362
00:32:42,111 --> 00:32:44,981
I'd like to find the same but for men.

363
00:32:45,462 --> 00:32:49,520
It was a gift.
It's the blue bottle in front of you.

364
00:33:02,888 --> 00:33:05,031
Don't get pregnant too soon now!

365
00:33:05,242 --> 00:33:09,541
He's in such a rush, I'm sure
I'll have twins on our wedding day!

366
00:33:10,784 --> 00:33:12,769
Do you have children?

367
00:33:21,831 --> 00:33:24,497
- Hello.
- Hello, come in.

368
00:33:24,662 --> 00:33:27,793
Just wanted to quickly
visit the apartment.

369
00:33:27,894 --> 00:33:29,128
Now?

370
00:33:29,289 --> 00:33:32,397
- I'll explain... Please come in.
- Sorry to bother you.

371
00:33:36,188 --> 00:33:38,955
Here's the kitchen.

372
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:42,527
There's a terrace in the back.

373
00:33:52,698 --> 00:33:56,283
- Have you already found something?
- Found what?

374
00:33:56,448 --> 00:33:59,476
Can you move out now
or are you still looking?

375
00:33:59,916 --> 00:34:02,140
Don't live here.

376
00:34:05,142 --> 00:34:07,330
It's full of light, Mom.

377
00:34:12,797 --> 00:34:16,303
- Do you want to raise the rent?
- It has nothing to do about that.

378
00:34:17,184 --> 00:34:20,088
- So then?
- have some problems. need the money.

379
00:34:20,254 --> 00:34:23,204
Thank you, Mr. Razaghi.
We'll be in touch.

380
00:34:23,366 --> 00:34:25,554
Just the garage and I'll be right back.

381
00:34:28,231 --> 00:34:30,535
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Goodbye.

382
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:34,210
- You didn't want to sell it!
- Now do.

383
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:37,594
Already told you. have worries.
need money.

384
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:42,737
I'm sick and tired
of all the complaints about you.

385
00:34:43,226 --> 00:34:46,527
- Who has complained?
- The neighbors.

386
00:34:46,695 --> 00:34:49,644
Why don't they tell me?

387
00:34:50,525 --> 00:34:53,587
- This is an apartment. - Yeah, and?
- You've opened a hair salon!

388
00:34:56,665 --> 00:34:58,254
I'll be right there!

389
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:00,133
Sorry for having bothered you.

390
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:06,146
Is there a problem with my salon?
don't bother anyone!

391
00:35:06,316 --> 00:35:10,219
- What's the problem?
- The neighbors are complaining.

392
00:35:10,385 --> 00:35:12,938
Too many strangers. Brides...

393
00:35:13,096 --> 00:35:15,887
They don't dare tell you themselves.
They tell me.

394
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:18,838
Some car stereos
were stolen last week.

395
00:35:18,999 --> 00:35:23,297
- By my customers?
- You don't know all of them.

396
00:35:23,464 --> 00:35:25,655
- For example, do you
know this young lady?

397
00:35:25,656 --> 00:35:27,843
- She's my niece.

398
00:35:28,249 --> 00:35:31,790
Sorry. didn't mean any harm.
Usually speaking...

399
00:35:32,278 --> 00:35:34,468
- Some tea, Auntie?
- Yes, darling.

400
00:35:34,631 --> 00:35:38,500
- Didn't even offer you any teal
- Thanks, but they're waiting for me.

401
00:35:38,659 --> 00:35:43,514
Just a sec.
Tell me who complained.

402
00:35:43,883 --> 00:35:47,785
As soon as a woman lives alone,
people say slanderous things.

403
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:52,887
Want this to be clear.
don't make any noise in this building.

404
00:35:53,334 --> 00:35:56,999
Okay, won't lie,
last wee had a bride...

405
00:35:57,283 --> 00:36:00,946
and there was a little music.
Not even 10 minutes.

406
00:36:01,111 --> 00:36:04,730
When my neighbors have parties,
never complain.

407
00:36:04,899 --> 00:36:08,200
- We'll talk tomorrow.
- Everyone leaves on vacation tomorrow.

408
00:36:08,369 --> 00:36:13,224
Upstairs they're going to Yazd.
Just across they're leaving at 4.

409
00:36:13,394 --> 00:36:17,172
Everyone will be gone.
Let's settle this now.

410
00:36:18,579 --> 00:36:20,167
This lighter doesn't work.

411
00:36:22,088 --> 00:36:23,916
I'll get in touch with you later.

412
00:36:24,402 --> 00:36:26,590
As if didn't have enough problems.

413
00:36:26,755 --> 00:36:29,386
Ma'am, the lighter doesn't work.

414
00:36:29,985 --> 00:36:32,446
If you don't mind, must go.

415
00:36:32,617 --> 00:36:35,566
- First have some tea.
- No, thanks.

416
00:36:36,844 --> 00:36:40,906
- Don't forget your photos!
- won't. But tell me...

417
00:36:41,589 --> 00:36:45,173
- How much do owe you?
- Keep your money.

418
00:36:46,575 --> 00:36:50,635
We'll worry about that when
you come on your wedding day.

419
00:36:50,802 --> 00:36:52,833
Wouldn't dare come back.

420
00:36:52,995 --> 00:36:55,548
Have you ever seen
a niece pay her aunt?

421
00:36:57,143 --> 00:36:59,808
- It's not done.
- So, it's my New Year's gift.

422
00:36:59,974 --> 00:37:01,958
I'm not really comfortable with this.

423
00:37:03,404 --> 00:37:05,275
But, thanks a lot.

424
00:37:20,992 --> 00:37:22,420
Ma.
am!

425
00:37:29,924 --> 00:37:32,193
- Have you forgotten something?
- No.

426
00:37:32,715 --> 00:37:37,094
That gentleman who was here earlier
asking you to leave...

427
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:40,167
I'm sorry, but overheard you.

428
00:37:40,533 --> 00:37:43,323
Think your next door neighbor
was involved.

429
00:37:43,484 --> 00:37:46,194
- Which one?
- The one across from you.

430
00:37:46,554 --> 00:37:49,458
- You know them?
- This morning, came to work for them.

431
00:37:51,778 --> 00:37:54,683
- You're the one who buzzed?
- Yes.

432
00:37:55,128 --> 00:37:58,157
- She asked you to come here?
- No, came on my own.

433
00:37:58,397 --> 00:38:03,821
- Didn't Mrs. Rahimi refer you?
- Yes, it was her.

434
00:38:05,058 --> 00:38:09,199
Saw her this morning
having her tires changed.

435
00:38:09,366 --> 00:38:13,631
She was furious.
I'm sure it was her.

436
00:38:15,466 --> 00:38:19,164
Don't know them. They don't
seem to be that kind of people.

437
00:38:19,654 --> 00:38:24,555
Hardly see her. bumped into
her husband. He seems serious.

438
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,512
The lady is kind of strange.

439
00:38:26,673 --> 00:38:31,018
Barely arrived when suddenly
she fired me and paid me.

440
00:38:31,179 --> 00:38:32,324
Why?

441
00:38:32,495 --> 00:38:36,193
She didn't trust me.
She was afraid might steal from her.

442
00:38:36,962 --> 00:38:42,497
Don't know anyone here.
They're all just acquaintances.

443
00:38:42,905 --> 00:38:46,206
But this lady doesn't trust anybody.

444
00:38:47,211 --> 00:38:50,478
When you go home,
try not to upset her.

445
00:38:50,641 --> 00:38:54,702
Don't want to cause any trouble.
Don't worry.

446
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,188
Sabri, come get your child,
he keeps crying.

447
00:39:07,669 --> 00:39:08,986
Take him down.

448
00:39:21,628 --> 00:39:23,260
Hello.

449
00:39:25,735 --> 00:39:27,448
Now you look like a bride.

450
00:39:28,048 --> 00:39:31,192
- Have changed?
- Yes, and you look much better.

451
00:39:36,503 --> 00:39:38,646
- Where is my chador?
- Over there.

452
00:39:40,809 --> 00:39:43,315
It really changes you,
congratulations.

453
00:39:44,518 --> 00:39:49,340
I'm going to make lunch,
put him down and I'll be back.

454
00:39:49,503 --> 00:39:52,770
Don't bother.
The young lady will do the rest.

455
00:39:53,971 --> 00:39:55,524
Goodbye.

456
00:39:58,197 --> 00:40:01,702
That kid was driving me crazy.
Give me a glass.

457
00:40:02,943 --> 00:40:05,086
If I'm staying, let's get to it.

458
00:40:05,456 --> 00:40:08,994
You have time. You can always
come tomorrow. I'm beat.

459
00:40:09,484 --> 00:40:13,067
- But you'll already be gone!
- Tomorrow, before we leave

460
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:15,738
You're leaving at 4 a. m.

461
00:40:33,810 --> 00:40:36,919
How do you know that?
Who told you?

462
00:40:37,081 --> 00:40:38,668
Simine.

463
00:40:41,547 --> 00:40:43,179
She knew?

464
00:40:44,856 --> 00:40:47,204
These don't have any hooks in them!

465
00:40:48,406 --> 00:40:50,913
Wait, how does she know?

466
00:40:51,356 --> 00:40:52,787
Come here.

467
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:57,653
Sit down.

468
00:41:04,597 --> 00:41:06,583
She knew we were leaving at 4?

469
00:41:09,582 --> 00:41:11,057
Think so.

470
00:41:11,655 --> 00:41:14,559
- How did it come up?
- don't remember.

471
00:41:14,766 --> 00:41:17,954
- What do you mean?
- We talked about lots of things.

472
00:41:18,874 --> 00:41:21,018
Why did you bring up our trip?

473
00:41:24,697 --> 00:41:26,966
We talked about
the holidays and trips.

474
00:41:27,129 --> 00:41:29,953
She said that lots of people
are going to Dubai.

475
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:34,022
She said you were also going
early tomorrow morning.

476
00:41:34,227 --> 00:41:35,861
You said at 4.

477
00:41:36,022 --> 00:41:38,928
- Said early.
- You said at 4!

478
00:41:39,094 --> 00:41:43,438
Meant early.
Before 4 is still night for me.

479
00:41:45,196 --> 00:41:46,465
And what else?

480
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:50,453
She wanted to know your age
and your husband's job.

481
00:41:51,456 --> 00:41:54,439
- Is that all?
- She isn't very talkative.

482
00:41:57,598 --> 00:42:00,626
She did a good job.
She's talented.

483
00:42:04,178 --> 00:42:05,652
She didn't let me pay.

484
00:42:09,003 --> 00:42:13,111
- You didn't say that you were here?
- didn't say anything.

485
00:42:17,617 --> 00:42:19,919
Should also put up the screens?

486
00:42:21,366 --> 00:42:23,159
Go back to work.

487
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:02,152
Listen, young lady...

488
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:06,501
don't feel well. I'm going
to take a shower and lie down.

489
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:08,655
Need you to do something.

490
00:43:08,823 --> 00:43:11,046
At exactly 2 o'clock,
go down this street,

491
00:43:11,455 --> 00:43:13,916
you'll reach the boulevard

492
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:17,773
and you'll see Martyr
Elementary, "Paknejad".

493
00:43:17,955 --> 00:43:19,509
- Can you remember that?
- Paknejad.

494
00:43:20,428 --> 00:43:24,569
You'll pick up my son from school.
Here's a clock.

495
00:43:24,735 --> 00:43:29,352
You must be there at 2 p. m.
The keys are under the shoe rack.

496
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,902
Don't answer the phone,
don't open the door.

497
00:43:33,867 --> 00:43:35,581
What's your son's name?

498
00:43:35,981 --> 00:43:39,202
Amir-Ali Samii,
he's in first grade.

499
00:43:40,009 --> 00:43:44,230
When you get back, if I'm sleeping
make some sandwiches.

500
00:43:44,396 --> 00:43:47,855
Forget about here for now.
Take care of the balcony.

501
00:43:48,025 --> 00:43:51,802
Pile things into the corner
and then start in the kitchen.

502
00:43:51,973 --> 00:43:54,922
If someone knocks,
don't wake me up.

503
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,669
I'd like to speak with Abdolreza.

504
00:44:13,229 --> 00:44:16,053
I'm his wife, his cousin,
mean...

505
00:44:18,692 --> 00:44:20,439
When's he coming back?

506
00:44:25,273 --> 00:44:27,939
Well, tell him that Rouhi called.

507
00:44:28,742 --> 00:44:32,362
I'll be working late.
I'll come back on my own.

508
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:56,955
<i>Mojdeh!</i>

509
00:45:57,635 --> 00:45:59,267
<i>Mojdeh, darling?</i>

510
00:46:03,058 --> 00:46:04,453
Ma'am?

511
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:37,627
Mrs. Simine?

512
00:46:50,954 --> 00:46:54,573
Hello, Mrs. Simine.
Have you seen my chador?

513
00:46:54,901 --> 00:46:57,885
- You had a chador?
- can't find it.

514
00:46:58,292 --> 00:47:02,194
- You weren't wearing one.
- It's not at their place either.

515
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:04,986
Mrs. Samii must've stolen it!

516
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:09,974
She's not here. She wanted
to lie down, but she's gone.

517
00:47:10,256 --> 00:47:13,000
She's probably not far.
Just wait a little.

518
00:47:13,206 --> 00:47:15,634
Have to pick her son
up from school.

519
00:47:15,799 --> 00:47:18,147
I'm running late. Goodbye.

520
00:47:20,584 --> 00:47:21,980
Wait, I'll drop you off.

521
00:47:22,978 --> 00:47:25,769
- No, it's okay.
- It's on the way.

522
00:47:33,386 --> 00:47:37,571
Can't imagine how they're
going to be ready tomorrow.

523
00:47:40,484 --> 00:47:44,432
For a pilgrimage to Qom,
we're ready 2 days in advance,

524
00:47:44,592 --> 00:47:46,384
and we're still late for the bus!

525
00:47:48,659 --> 00:47:51,292
Put your seat belt on,
there's a police officer.

526
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:59,147
4 o'clock in the morning is early.
A little later, they'd make it.

527
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:02,654
- 4 o'clock?
- That's what you said.

528
00:48:03,735 --> 00:48:06,003
Heard it from one of the neighbors.

529
00:48:10,514 --> 00:48:13,180
Think we're here, sir.

530
00:48:14,102 --> 00:48:16,486
Drop her off in front of the school.

531
00:48:16,656 --> 00:48:20,194
Thank you so much.
It was far.

532
00:48:52,228 --> 00:48:55,734
Why don't they pick up
their own kid like everyone else?

533
00:48:55,897 --> 00:48:59,879
One day it's his aunt
or his cousin or they just forget.

534
00:49:00,044 --> 00:49:01,679
His mother was busy.

535
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:05,027
Busy? The other parents
aren't unemployed!

536
00:49:05,189 --> 00:49:07,856
Don't see why
should trust you with him.

537
00:49:09,815 --> 00:49:11,881
Sami, do you know this lady?

538
00:49:14,202 --> 00:49:18,150
- Call you mother.
- Nobody's home.

539
00:49:18,749 --> 00:49:22,492
- My mom is at home. - No she isn't.
- She was this morning.

540
00:49:22,656 --> 00:49:24,211
That was this morning.

541
00:49:24,452 --> 00:49:28,353
Find his file,
we'll call his father.

542
00:49:28,639 --> 00:49:32,383
- Tell him a woman has come
to get his son. - I'll do it.

543
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:36,174
What am going to do
with the two of you?

544
00:49:36,654 --> 00:49:40,602
Haven't already said
not to bring that to school?

545
00:49:40,842 --> 00:49:41,910
Yes or no?

546
00:49:42,238 --> 00:49:44,699
Those firecrackers aren't ours.

547
00:49:44,870 --> 00:49:48,931
- They were in your book bag!
- My friends put them there.

548
00:49:49,456 --> 00:49:52,723
Firecrackers worth 600 Tomans?
And so many!

549
00:49:53,006 --> 00:49:56,988
- They'd just give them to you?
- Those are only 400 Tomans each!

550
00:49:57,153 --> 00:49:59,375
The 600 Tomans ones are different.

551
00:49:59,545 --> 00:50:02,971
Get out of here.
I'll take care of you two later.

552
00:50:03,174 --> 00:50:04,321
Get going!

553
00:50:06,484 --> 00:50:10,749
Give me the matches, let's test them.

554
00:50:12,068 --> 00:50:13,973
These kids, swear!

555
00:50:24,789 --> 00:50:27,943
- How's it coming?
- There's nothing to do.

556
00:50:28,098 --> 00:50:30,323
- You can see her hair.
- Forget it.

557
00:50:30,731 --> 00:50:32,763
- Do you have matches?
- No.

558
00:50:37,312 --> 00:50:39,581
Mr. Nikbakht?

559
00:50:40,064 --> 00:50:45,487
Go out and buy some matches,
we're all out.

560
00:50:46,325 --> 00:50:48,628
Mahmud, it's not working.
What should we do?

561
00:50:48,797 --> 00:50:52,780
She's only 7 years old
and they want to hide her hair.

562
00:50:52,945 --> 00:50:56,767
Was so busy. What am
supposed to do! Close that door.

563
00:50:57,092 --> 00:51:00,790
- Why not after the holidays!
- Sadeghpour insisted.

564
00:51:00,962 --> 00:51:04,544
He harassed me.
He wants it aired on New Year's eve

565
00:51:04,708 --> 00:51:08,930
Tell him to forget it.
Let him talk to the director.

566
00:51:09,096 --> 00:51:12,998
Why doesn't he use my grandma
instead of the little girl!

567
00:51:13,164 --> 00:51:16,703
- What can do ..l - You know him.
He'll ruin our holidays.

568
00:51:16,873 --> 00:51:19,777
Maybe we could do something
on Photoshop.

569
00:51:19,944 --> 00:51:23,800
That's too long.
It's their responsibility.

570
00:51:23,893 --> 00:51:26,058
- He doesn't know howl
- Mr. Morteza, telephone.

571
00:51:27,361 --> 00:51:30,503
Yes?
Yes, it's me.

572
00:51:31,110 --> 00:51:33,662
Ah, hello, how are you?

573
00:51:37,211 --> 00:51:39,163
Who is it?

574
00:51:40,481 --> 00:51:44,350
It's okay, but let me speak to her.

575
00:51:51,089 --> 00:51:53,915
She asked me to come get him.

576
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:56,910
She went out.

577
00:51:57,711 --> 00:52:00,058
Didn't know.
She didn't say anything.

578
00:52:01,219 --> 00:52:04,089
Your son wants to talk to you.

579
00:52:04,688 --> 00:52:06,436
Hi Dad.

580
00:52:07,919 --> 00:52:12,343
How are you? I'm fine.
Are we still going tonight?

581
00:52:12,784 --> 00:52:15,971
Yes, I'll get you your firecrackers.

582
00:52:16,294 --> 00:52:19,799
Yes, I'll get that too.
You stay with her, okay?

583
00:52:20,202 --> 00:52:23,899
Promise?
Goodbye, son.

584
00:52:50,590 --> 00:52:53,052
Just a drop more and it'll work.

585
00:53:59,383 --> 00:54:03,602
I've driven past you twice and
you kept standing on the sidewalk.

586
00:54:03,769 --> 00:54:08,704
Not all men are cowards.
But many go out of their minds.

587
00:54:22,314 --> 00:54:24,617
Let me go.
It's none of your business.

588
00:54:24,787 --> 00:54:26,215
Everyone out!

589
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:30,400
You can't lock her up.
She can leave when she wants!

590
00:54:30,569 --> 00:54:32,474
Everyone out!

591
00:54:37,987 --> 00:54:40,777
- Don't want it.
- Come on, it'll calm you down.

592
00:54:40,938 --> 00:54:44,081
- What's wrong?
- She's driving me crazy!

593
00:54:44,408 --> 00:54:47,516
She's already ruined my life
and it's not over!

594
00:54:49,232 --> 00:54:53,259
She spied on me wearing a chador

595
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:55,848
in the middle
of the New Year's havoc!

596
00:54:56,012 --> 00:55:00,436
And you beat her?
never imagined you doing that!

597
00:55:00,759 --> 00:55:04,536
All she brings me is shame,
at home and now at work.

598
00:55:04,706 --> 00:55:07,497
You could've sent her home
without a all that

599
00:55:07,658 --> 00:55:10,687
and taken care of your dirty laundry!
- don't know what I'm doing.

600
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:15,590
I'm going crazy!
And we're going on a trip tomorrow!

601
00:55:16,870 --> 00:55:20,090
- Let me got
- You'll just make things worse.

602
00:55:20,778 --> 00:55:24,045
She had the maid pick up my son!
Can you believe that?

603
00:55:24,208 --> 00:55:27,157
- Such bullshit!
- What have you done?

604
00:55:27,318 --> 00:55:32,094
Nothing! can't even remember
the last time she cooked!

605
00:55:32,264 --> 00:55:35,213
When did the neighbors
smell her cooking last?

606
00:55:36,451 --> 00:55:40,636
You must've dove something.
She must have reasons for doing that!

607
00:55:40,797 --> 00:55:43,940
What are you saying?
You've known me for 11 years!

608
00:55:44,108 --> 00:55:48,530
- She suspects something.
- swear don't know!

609
00:55:48,693 --> 00:55:52,313
She's been going on and on
about a trip to Dubai.

610
00:55:52,602 --> 00:55:55,234
It was non-stop:
"When are we leaving?"

611
00:55:55,394 --> 00:55:57,026
"Let's go to Dubai!"

612
00:55:57,188 --> 00:56:00,932
thought it would be good
for all of us.

613
00:56:01,255 --> 00:56:04,319
And then this morning,
she says she's not coming!

614
00:56:04,647 --> 00:56:07,074
She wanted to paint the apartment.
said fine.

615
00:56:07,238 --> 00:56:10,222
"The phone rings:
“How much for your apartment?"

616
00:56:10,389 --> 00:56:13,610
She put out an ad without telling me!

617
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:18,712
You can't imagine
how she speaks to me!

618
00:56:18,883 --> 00:56:19,949
Feel sorry for her.

619
00:56:20,119 --> 00:56:24,703
You saw how she was treated
in the street!

620
00:56:25,105 --> 00:56:27,815
She shouldn't be standing
around like that!

621
00:56:27,975 --> 00:56:31,515
She is sensitive.
She needs attention.

622
00:56:32,163 --> 00:56:35,146
She also has problems
with her own family!

623
00:56:35,473 --> 00:56:39,533
"“L don't want to see her,
don't like him..."

624
00:56:40,299 --> 00:56:44,201
Get a grip on yourself
Take a look around!

625
00:56:47,995 --> 00:56:49,629
Eighteen...

626
00:56:56,569 --> 00:56:57,964
Eighteen, I'm coming!

627
00:56:58,683 --> 00:57:00,316
Hello, ma'am!

628
00:57:07,497 --> 00:57:09,686
Mom's home, Amir-Ali.

629
00:57:13,718 --> 00:57:15,590
Come out, Mom's home.

630
00:57:33,179 --> 00:57:36,287
Already looked in his room.
He'll come out!

631
00:57:36,448 --> 00:57:39,080
Amir-Ali, come out, enough already!

632
00:57:42,152 --> 00:57:44,942
Don't worry, we were just playing.

633
00:57:46,739 --> 00:57:49,689
Come out, I'm serious now!

634
00:57:56,669 --> 00:57:58,415
Come out.

635
00:58:00,776 --> 00:58:03,839
Why did you come?
What are you doing?

636
00:58:04,007 --> 00:58:05,991
Let go of my arm.

637
00:58:08,832 --> 00:58:11,214
Come on, stop whining!

638
00:58:12,979 --> 00:58:15,771
- Put your shoes on.
- Where are we going?

639
00:58:18,125 --> 00:58:21,392
- Where are we going?
- I'll tell you after.

640
00:58:21,553 --> 00:58:23,777
I'm seeing the fireworks with Dad.

641
00:58:23,947 --> 00:58:25,852
Put on your shoes and be quiet!

642
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:27,732
You be quiet, freak!

643
00:58:30,925 --> 00:58:33,193
Put on your shoes!

644
00:58:33,557 --> 00:58:35,463
Calm down, ma'am.

645
00:58:38,024 --> 00:58:39,851
I'm not coming!

646
00:58:40,097 --> 00:58:42,684
Be quiet!

647
00:58:46,838 --> 00:58:48,471
What's going on?

648
00:58:48,991 --> 00:58:52,893
Hello. What's going on?

649
00:59:02,270 --> 00:59:05,652
Pack your things. We're going.

650
00:59:06,339 --> 00:59:10,160
Guess came at a bad time.
Are you going out?

651
00:59:11,563 --> 00:59:14,785
Mojdeh, I've come to apologize.

652
00:59:15,193 --> 00:59:17,256
Just forget about that.

653
00:59:17,425 --> 00:59:19,251
Is Mahsid home?

654
00:59:19,619 --> 00:59:23,202
- Did you want to come over?
- One or two nights.

655
00:59:23,448 --> 00:59:25,001
Does Morteza know?

656
00:59:25,282 --> 00:59:26,676
I'm not coming.

657
00:59:28,233 --> 00:59:29,786
I'm going to tell him.

658
00:59:30,186 --> 00:59:33,330
Let me calm him down,
or he'll never come.

659
00:59:35,410 --> 00:59:37,203
Men never cry!

660
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:40,235
- What happened?
- Hello, Uncle.

661
00:59:50,207 --> 00:59:53,349
Ma'am, what happened?

662
00:59:56,507 --> 01:00:00,330
- Did you tell him?
- Me? swear didn't.

663
01:00:00,496 --> 01:00:04,114
The school did.
They didn't want to give him to me.

664
01:00:05,201 --> 01:00:07,105
You weren't home.

665
01:00:08,232 --> 01:00:11,534
- Would you like some water?
- You can go now.

666
01:00:34,314 --> 01:00:35,981
Jerk.

667
01:00:45,959 --> 01:00:48,545
- Hello, sir.
- What are you doing there?

668
01:00:48,710 --> 01:00:51,218
My chador is upstairs.
But don't want to go up.

669
01:00:51,383 --> 01:00:53,651
- Is Mojdeh home?
- Who?

670
01:00:53,814 --> 01:00:56,832
- My wife?
- Yes, but they're leaving.

671
01:00:56,965 --> 01:00:59,313
- I'd rather not go up.
- Come on...

672
01:01:01,870 --> 01:01:06,487
Mom says that someone's number
keeps showing up on the phone.

673
01:01:07,294 --> 01:01:09,847
She doesn't know whose it is.

674
01:01:10,844 --> 01:01:13,987
Last night, when was sleeping,

675
01:01:14,154 --> 01:01:17,578
heard a window break,
thought it was a robber.

676
01:01:17,742 --> 01:01:21,044
Saw Dad and Mom fighting.

677
01:01:21,212 --> 01:01:24,718
Dad broke the window
with his hand.

678
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,779
He was bleeding
and went to the hospital.

679
01:01:30,026 --> 01:01:33,894
- He came back late.
- Do you know why they were fighting?

680
01:01:34,413 --> 01:01:40,232
Mom says there's someone else.
That's all she said to me.

681
01:01:40,753 --> 01:01:43,497
Go wash your face.
We'll go to our place.

682
01:01:43,663 --> 01:01:47,204
I'm supposed to see
the fireworks with Dad.

683
01:01:47,453 --> 01:01:49,121
You have to be a good boy.

684
01:01:49,726 --> 01:01:52,597
Dad will be sad if I'm not here.

685
01:01:52,758 --> 01:01:54,707
There's my dad!

686
01:02:00,493 --> 01:02:02,638
Why are you crying, dear?

687
01:02:03,564 --> 01:02:04,972
How are you, Ahmad?

688
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:07,791
Could be better.
What's wrong with your wife?

689
01:02:10,025 --> 01:02:12,930
- Where does she want to go?
- don't know, she wants to leave.

690
01:02:13,096 --> 01:02:15,001
To our place, think.

691
01:02:15,569 --> 01:02:19,946
Stay with Uncle Ahmad, I'm going to
talk to Mom and then we'll go out.

692
01:02:20,114 --> 01:02:21,861
Don't cry.

693
01:02:26,575 --> 01:02:28,368
I'm not going to hurt her.

694
01:02:29,287 --> 01:02:31,590
Go and be with him, please.

695
01:02:31,999 --> 01:02:35,107
Darling, listen to me,
after you can do as you please.

696
01:02:35,269 --> 01:02:39,410
You can leave with the boy.
Just let me talk.

697
01:02:39,576 --> 01:02:43,921
- Let's all go to my place.
- You know our situation.

698
01:02:44,083 --> 01:02:45,275
Don't leave!

699
01:02:45,439 --> 01:02:47,901
- Want to talk to you.
- Don't touch me, asshole!

700
01:02:49,546 --> 01:02:50,863
It's none of your business, Ahmad!

701
01:02:51,023 --> 01:02:54,164
Come on! The poor guy
has come to make up with you.

702
01:02:54,331 --> 01:02:55,601
His wife forced him to.

703
01:02:55,767 --> 01:02:58,671
I'm sorry, Ahmad. I'm sorry.

704
01:03:00,233 --> 01:03:01,903
Please forgive me.

705
01:03:07,093 --> 01:03:08,886
Go to your room.

706
01:03:09,645 --> 01:03:12,629
I'd like a taxi, please.
For Samii.

707
01:03:13,714 --> 01:03:15,221
We don't want it...

708
01:03:15,388 --> 01:03:18,497
Listen to me, I'm sorry.
Listen for a minute.

709
01:03:18,658 --> 01:03:23,480
Have never laid a finger
on anyone up till today!

710
01:03:23,643 --> 01:03:25,594
But you pushed me...

711
01:03:25,756 --> 01:03:28,309
- It's my fault?
- Yes, it is.

712
01:03:28,828 --> 01:03:32,015
Bastard! It's okay to beat
your wife in the street?

713
01:03:32,178 --> 01:03:35,523
- It's your fault.
- My fault? Just tell my the truth!

714
01:03:35,687 --> 01:03:39,034
- What truth?
- Whose number is this?

715
01:03:39,197 --> 01:03:41,171
- How should know?

716
01:03:41,172 --> 01:03:43,143
- Why does she call you
as soon as I'm out?

717
01:03:43,304 --> 01:03:46,049
What in the world!

718
01:03:46,215 --> 01:03:49,720
- Tell me the truth! - What truth?
- What are you afraid of?

719
01:03:51,319 --> 01:03:52,954
Come here a minute.

720
01:03:53,115 --> 01:03:55,337
Amir-Ali, go to your room.

721
01:03:55,507 --> 01:03:57,889
Come here. Hurry up.

722
01:03:59,255 --> 01:04:02,955
Just give me one minute.

723
01:04:03,444 --> 01:04:07,108
Whose apartment
did you buzz this morning?

724
01:04:07,273 --> 01:04:11,809
Your buzzer didn't work.
buzzed your neighbor.

725
01:04:11,978 --> 01:04:13,566
She called you to open the gate.

726
01:04:13,732 --> 01:04:15,525
And the day before?

727
01:04:15,607 --> 01:04:18,091
She wanted to know why there
were complaints about her.

728
01:04:18,278 --> 01:04:21,309
Told her didn't have any problems.

729
01:04:21,470 --> 01:04:23,613
You defended her at the meeting!

730
01:04:23,782 --> 01:04:26,493
They wanted me to file a report.
refused.

731
01:04:26,653 --> 01:04:29,115
Your voice was on her machine.

732
01:04:29,285 --> 01:04:34,028
Who said that? Just say it
so everything will be out in the open!

733
01:04:34,191 --> 01:04:35,938
You're going out with her!

734
01:04:36,783 --> 01:04:39,607
There's nobody! I'd never make
such a mistake as bringing...

735
01:04:39,775 --> 01:04:43,358
Why did you leave?
We were supposed to talk!

736
01:04:46,793 --> 01:04:49,664
Ask the son of a bitch who called me.

737
01:04:49,825 --> 01:04:54,044
She called to cancel your date!
You think I'm an idiot?

738
01:04:54,529 --> 01:04:56,799
- We're leaving!
- No!

739
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:00,584
You should be ashamed, Mojdeh!

740
01:05:00,950 --> 01:05:04,694
You put on her chador to spy on me.
How shameful!

741
01:05:04,858 --> 01:05:09,282
- Open, want to leave!
- You disgraced me!

742
01:05:09,604 --> 01:05:11,747
Go to your room, dear.

743
01:05:11,917 --> 01:05:16,613
It's my fault? You didn't have
a date with her between 2 and 5?

744
01:05:16,783 --> 01:05:18,767
Calm down and come here.

745
01:05:19,334 --> 01:05:22,159
Go ask our neighbor
for her answering machine.

746
01:05:23,203 --> 01:05:27,106
Shut up!
All we need is for her to come!

747
01:05:27,589 --> 01:05:32,047
How can prove that you're sick,
that you're imagining this!

748
01:05:32,216 --> 01:05:33,804
My God!

749
01:05:35,248 --> 01:05:36,993
I'm the one who's crazy!

750
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:41,864
Didn't even know we were
leaving at 4. But she knew!

751
01:05:42,425 --> 01:05:44,139
What do you mean, she knew?

752
01:05:45,616 --> 01:05:47,885
You're asking me?

753
01:05:48,168 --> 01:05:50,913
Swear didn't tell her anything!

754
01:05:51,079 --> 01:05:52,350
Don't get involved!

755
01:05:52,515 --> 01:05:53,582
He's afraid!

756
01:05:53,751 --> 01:05:55,578
I'm the one who got the tickets!

757
01:05:56,024 --> 01:05:59,007
- And I'm the crazy one?
- Nothing is going on between us.

758
01:05:59,175 --> 01:06:02,476
Don't swear, just find some dignity.

759
01:06:03,961 --> 01:06:07,908
You're right, let me go.

760
01:06:08,068 --> 01:06:10,938
Simine gave me the tickets.

761
01:06:11,099 --> 01:06:14,320
She asked me to give them to you.
You were out.

762
01:06:15,087 --> 01:06:16,959
Why did she have our tickets?

763
01:06:17,281 --> 01:06:20,900
Your buzzer is broken.
They were dropped off at her place.

764
01:06:21,070 --> 01:06:24,733
She gave them to me.
put them on the table.

765
01:06:26,054 --> 01:06:28,878
She peeked at them
when she handed them to me.

766
01:06:29,485 --> 01:06:31,310
Calm down, darling.

767
01:06:38,935 --> 01:06:40,729
Why didn't you tell me?

768
01:06:42,963 --> 01:06:47,308
It wasn't my business.
didn't want to bother you.

769
01:06:47,669 --> 01:06:49,858
Put his jacket on.

770
01:08:05,115 --> 01:08:08,985
I'm a terrible person.
can't even look at you.

771
01:08:10,738 --> 01:08:14,199
Had no right to hit you today.

772
01:08:16,841 --> 01:08:20,742
You can't imagine how awful feel.
Forgive me.

773
01:08:26,251 --> 01:08:31,708
Sweetheart...
Please look at me.

774
01:08:40,568 --> 01:08:45,311
Swear on our son's life.

775
01:08:46,032 --> 01:08:50,456
I've never sworn on Amir-Ali's life,
but swear love you.

776
01:08:51,057 --> 01:08:54,006
Love our life,
love you, love our son.

777
01:08:54,368 --> 01:08:56,352
Let's just forget all of this.

778
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:59,306
We're ready, Dad, let's go.

779
01:09:00,907 --> 01:09:02,780
Why don't you come with us?

780
01:09:04,855 --> 01:09:06,727
No, go. You promised him.

781
01:09:06,889 --> 01:09:11,551
- Come on, Dad!
- We're going.

782
01:09:22,324 --> 01:09:24,466
- Are we going?
- Yes.

783
01:09:24,636 --> 01:09:26,939
Sir, this is yours.

784
01:09:27,108 --> 01:09:30,217
- Come, I'll take you home.
- Thanks, I'll lake the bus.

785
01:09:30,379 --> 01:09:34,802
- You'll be late.
- live really far, sir.

786
01:09:35,484 --> 01:09:38,512
I'll take you to a taxi stand.

787
01:09:38,873 --> 01:09:44,250
- Come see the show with just
- Sorry, I'm running late.

788
01:09:44,416 --> 01:09:46,764
Excuse me, ma'am,
can have my chador back?

789
01:09:46,929 --> 01:09:48,675
I'll pay you back for that.

790
01:09:50,997 --> 01:09:52,665
Goodbye, ma'am.

791
01:10:05,672 --> 01:10:09,892
I'm going to see the fireworks!

792
01:10:12,411 --> 01:10:14,204
Where do you live?

793
01:10:14,365 --> 01:10:17,270
Near the Imam Davoud mausoleum.

794
01:10:17,756 --> 01:10:20,308
Could you wait a little longer?

795
01:10:20,707 --> 01:10:23,577
I'll take you home when we're done.

796
01:10:23,738 --> 01:10:26,370
Can't.
My fiance is waiting for me.

797
01:10:26,529 --> 01:10:30,670
How do you expect to get home?

798
01:10:30,837 --> 01:10:33,945
You'll spend a fortune on a taxi.

799
01:10:34,345 --> 01:10:35,855
Don't want to be a bother.

800
01:10:36,022 --> 01:10:39,446
You won't. It's dangerous at night.

801
01:10:40,886 --> 01:10:46,229
Actually, one of my co-workers
finished late and then disappeared.

802
01:10:47,027 --> 01:10:52,042
They're still looking for her.
People at work think it's the "Bat".

803
01:10:52,292 --> 01:10:54,276
- Who?
- The Bat

804
01:10:54,445 --> 01:10:55,715
But they captured him.

805
01:10:55,882 --> 01:10:59,340
But he's not the only one,
there are more like him.

806
01:10:59,789 --> 01:11:01,014
Amir-Ali, careful!

807
01:11:12,391 --> 01:11:16,170
Could you play with him
for half an hour? I'll be right back.

808
01:11:16,618 --> 01:11:19,726
- Not a half an hour, an hour!
- Okay.

809
01:11:21,803 --> 01:11:25,830
- But, no longer than an hour!
- I'll take you, don't worry.

810
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:28,577
Just have some errands.

811
01:11:28,742 --> 01:11:31,851
Come here, son.

812
01:11:33,049 --> 01:11:36,996
Listen to whatever she says.
Don't go near any fire or firecrackers.

813
01:11:37,157 --> 01:11:38,666
Not allowed!

814
01:11:40,786 --> 01:11:44,246
Who's Daddy's darling?
Amir-Ali.

815
01:11:44,415 --> 01:11:48,441
Don't go too far, stay in this area.

816
01:12:10,775 --> 01:12:13,202
Give me a box of matches, please.

817
01:12:20,266 --> 01:12:22,491
And a pack of Marlboro.

818
01:12:25,252 --> 01:12:26,921
Since when do you smoke?

819
01:12:27,087 --> 01:12:30,909
Hello, Mr. Samii.
don't smoke.

820
01:12:31,473 --> 01:12:35,093
- What are you afraid of?
- My mom's kind of serious.

821
01:12:36,019 --> 01:12:38,526
Get lost, don't want to see you!

822
01:12:39,649 --> 01:12:41,758
Forget it, who's that loser?

823
01:13:20,606 --> 01:13:22,238
Are you late?

824
01:13:24,912 --> 01:13:27,623
- Can't stay long.
- Why not?

825
01:13:27,783 --> 01:13:29,417
Have things to do.

826
01:13:30,535 --> 01:13:34,357
Thought wouldn't see you
until after the holidays.

827
01:13:35,042 --> 01:13:37,595
- It'll be hard.
- No it won't...

828
01:13:38,670 --> 01:13:42,812
- I'm glad you came.
- What was going on at your place?

829
01:13:44,532 --> 01:13:47,720
- Nothing. It's all okay now.
- You were fighting.

830
01:13:48,082 --> 01:13:50,986
It's over now,
let's not talk about that.

831
01:13:51,352 --> 01:13:53,304
So, why are you in such bad shape?

832
01:14:07,663 --> 01:14:09,614
Keep it as a souvenir.

833
01:14:14,962 --> 01:14:19,307
- So, what's wrong?
- Nothing, said to forget about it.

834
01:14:20,823 --> 01:14:25,519
- What are you doing for the holidays?
- Nothing.

835
01:14:26,288 --> 01:14:28,590
But you try and have a good time.

836
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:32,464
Take care of yourself,
you don't look good.

837
01:14:33,226 --> 01:14:35,687
Have a good time?
You must be kidding!

838
01:14:35,859 --> 01:14:38,887
Go crazy when don't see you
for one day.

839
01:14:39,048 --> 01:14:43,552
- How can have a good time?
- This isn't what we agreed on.

840
01:14:43,833 --> 01:14:47,260
- Stop, I'm serious.
- I'm serious also.

841
01:14:47,663 --> 01:14:51,884
These situations have nothing
to do with old promises.

842
01:14:52,169 --> 01:14:55,514
Your wife is a wreck.
understand that.

843
01:14:56,795 --> 01:14:59,778
Know. What can do?

844
01:15:00,385 --> 01:15:05,160
Feel so lost.
disgust myself.

845
01:15:05,330 --> 01:15:07,201
This can't go on.

846
01:15:07,403 --> 01:15:12,224
Hit her in the middle of the
street today. In front of everyone.

847
01:15:14,223 --> 01:15:17,094
- Does she suspect something?
- No.

848
01:15:18,291 --> 01:15:21,274
She has no reason to any more.

849
01:15:25,669 --> 01:15:29,365
- Then this is the perfect moment.
- To do what?

850
01:15:32,568 --> 01:15:34,553
For us to stop seeing each other.

851
01:15:36,836 --> 01:15:39,058
Stop seeing each other,
when everything's been arranged?

852
01:15:39,227 --> 01:15:41,099
Arranged?

853
01:15:45,169 --> 01:15:48,516
This can't go on.
It's useless.

854
01:15:48,679 --> 01:15:51,900
Stop talking about that.
Let's go for a drive.

855
01:15:53,944 --> 01:15:55,532
Have things to do.

856
01:15:55,698 --> 01:15:59,237
Then for the few minutes
we have together, let's not talk.

857
01:16:00,085 --> 01:16:03,351
- I've come to tell you that.
- Tell me what?

858
01:16:05,469 --> 01:16:08,179
You're constantly calling me

859
01:16:08,340 --> 01:16:12,401
and now you're telling me
that it's over.

860
01:16:12,727 --> 01:16:15,994
Just like that!
Thank you, Simine.

861
01:16:16,874 --> 01:16:19,143
This can't continue.

862
01:16:19,666 --> 01:16:22,775
But you don't want to understand.

863
01:16:23,055 --> 01:16:27,275
You're ruining your life,
your family.

864
01:16:27,482 --> 01:16:29,592
This is just an affair...

865
01:16:30,992 --> 01:16:35,653
Are you crying?
Let me see, silly.

866
01:16:35,817 --> 01:16:37,927
It's just an allergy.

867
01:16:38,808 --> 01:16:40,635
What happened to your hand?

868
01:16:57,392 --> 01:16:59,061
Are you staying in Teheran?

869
01:17:00,382 --> 01:17:02,017
Forget about it.

870
01:17:02,577 --> 01:17:04,846
We're no longer children.

871
01:17:07,163 --> 01:17:08,908
Don't know what to say.

872
01:17:09,077 --> 01:17:12,616
Your wife would've preferred
seeing you with a whore

873
01:17:12,786 --> 01:17:14,850
than with another woman.

874
01:17:15,178 --> 01:17:19,399
- I'll call you when get there.
- won't pick up the phone.

875
01:17:19,566 --> 01:17:23,024
Why won't you understand? I'll call.

876
01:17:23,314 --> 01:17:25,536
You'll get used to it, honey.

877
01:17:26,026 --> 01:17:29,371
My husband also
was in love with me.

878
01:17:29,854 --> 01:17:33,995
And then one day, he left me.

879
01:17:34,161 --> 01:17:37,065
Please stop...
That's enough.

880
01:17:39,466 --> 01:17:43,130
Think of it as a lovely memory
that is over.

881
01:17:43,294 --> 01:17:45,324
You're going to Dubai.

882
01:17:45,926 --> 01:17:50,271
Maybe even to live there
for a while. You'll get over this.

883
01:17:50,832 --> 01:17:53,180
Forget about me, I'm not worth it.

884
01:17:54,021 --> 01:17:57,481
- Just stay a little longer.
- Don't touch me.

885
01:17:58,049 --> 01:18:00,352
Can't. have to go.

886
01:18:00,522 --> 01:18:03,585
- I'm meeting someone.
- Who?

887
01:18:05,227 --> 01:18:07,860
I'll call you.

888
01:18:09,574 --> 01:18:12,319
Don't get upset if don't answer.

889
01:18:12,925 --> 01:18:14,275
Take care of yourself.

890
01:18:17,152 --> 01:18:18,820
It's over.

891
01:23:14,377 --> 01:23:16,169
Excuse me, sir.

892
01:23:18,643 --> 01:23:22,987
- Are you Simine's neighbor?
- Yes, I'm her neighbor.

893
01:23:23,149 --> 01:23:25,532
Brought our daughter.
She's not here.

894
01:23:25,703 --> 01:23:28,811
How are you?
recognize you.

895
01:23:30,448 --> 01:23:34,227
She sees her before the holidays.
She's been asking to see her for a week!

896
01:23:34,396 --> 01:23:38,741
I'm Samii, her neighbor.
I've just arrived.

897
01:23:38,902 --> 01:23:41,648
- Come in.
- don't want to bother you.

898
01:23:41,814 --> 01:23:43,322
- I'll open the gate.
- No...

899
01:23:43,488 --> 01:23:45,123
You really don't have to.

900
01:23:45,284 --> 01:23:48,109
Thanks a lot. Come in.

901
01:24:04,904 --> 01:24:07,809
My daughter is in the car.
Happy New Year.

902
01:24:07,975 --> 01:24:12,240
- To you and to your family.
- Same to you.

903
01:24:30,867 --> 01:24:32,771
He's sleeping. Can you get out?

904
01:24:45,223 --> 01:24:47,934
Can you carry this, please?

905
01:24:51,922 --> 01:24:54,112
Hurry, before the gate closes.

906
01:24:58,582 --> 01:25:00,171
Put that here.

907
01:25:06,598 --> 01:25:08,311
You don't have to come up.
Wait for me.

908
01:25:08,752 --> 01:25:11,304
I'll put Amir-Ali in bed,
and come back.

909
01:25:11,463 --> 01:25:13,052
Push number 6.

910
01:25:43,767 --> 01:25:45,478
Mom!

911
01:25:56,089 --> 01:25:59,867
Hello, darling.
Be careful not to fall.

912
01:26:02,750 --> 01:26:06,051
- Who gave that to you?
- Dad!

913
01:26:06,219 --> 01:26:08,123
Dad is so nice!

914
01:26:10,127 --> 01:26:11,953
Carry Mom's bag?

915
01:26:13,875 --> 01:26:16,144
- How are you?
- Fine, and you?

916
01:26:17,863 --> 01:26:22,320
You also got
some grass for the holiday!

917
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:28,783
We'll put a red ribbon on it.

918
01:26:28,950 --> 01:26:30,582
You're still here?

919
01:26:31,542 --> 01:26:35,082
- Can't you say hello, sweetie?
- Hello.

920
01:26:38,002 --> 01:26:40,509
- What is it?
- Nothing.

921
01:27:37,784 --> 01:27:40,052
- Hello.
- Still here?

922
01:27:40,215 --> 01:27:42,768
- Your husband...
- He didn't drop you off?

923
01:27:42,928 --> 01:27:47,034
Morteza,
why didn't you find her a taxi?

924
01:27:47,553 --> 01:27:49,776
He's putting Amir-Ali down,
he's coming.

925
01:27:51,302 --> 01:27:54,251
- Ma'am...
- Yes?

926
01:27:55,250 --> 01:27:57,076
Today, ...

927
01:28:01,152 --> 01:28:03,581
- What, today?
- Quiet, he's sleeping.

928
01:28:03,745 --> 01:28:04,652
Nothing.

929
01:28:04,821 --> 01:28:07,248
Can you take care of the suitcases?

930
01:28:07,413 --> 01:28:09,795
- What did you want to tell me?
- Nothing, ma'am.

931
01:28:09,966 --> 01:28:13,268
If you need help, ask the concierge.

932
01:28:13,675 --> 01:28:15,659
Why'd you come up?
was on my way.

933
01:28:16,746 --> 01:28:18,220
Let's go.

934
01:28:23,167 --> 01:28:24,879
Come home quick.

935
01:29:14,692 --> 01:29:17,641
You would never have been able
to get home alone.

936
01:29:23,823 --> 01:29:28,247
You did a good thing today.
You really helped me out.

937
01:29:29,485 --> 01:29:31,947
Don't understand
why you went upstairs.

938
01:29:32,318 --> 01:29:35,699
- What are you going to tell her?
- Nothing.

939
01:29:36,146 --> 01:29:39,651
You wanted to tell her something
near the door.

940
01:29:42,368 --> 01:29:46,144
- Was it about the tickets?
- No.

941
01:29:46,315 --> 01:29:50,262
You told her Simine gave you
the tickets. Did you lie?

942
01:29:51,381 --> 01:29:54,252
- Yes. - Why?
- Just because.

943
01:29:55,368 --> 01:29:57,195
You don't lie just because.

944
01:29:58,958 --> 01:30:02,577
Mrs. Simine
was very nice to me today.

945
01:30:03,504 --> 01:30:05,012
And?

946
01:30:08,171 --> 01:30:12,469
You shouldn't have come up.
Does she know?

947
01:30:23,403 --> 01:30:27,783
- Drop me off here.
- I'll take you home, it's late.

948
01:30:27,951 --> 01:30:31,094
- Thanks, but I'll get out here.
- Why?

949
01:30:31,301 --> 01:30:34,805
Abdolreza is there.
I'll go by myself.

950
01:30:34,968 --> 01:30:37,238
He must really love you
to wait so long.

951
01:30:37,401 --> 01:30:40,226
- Stop here.
- Okay.

952
01:30:45,895 --> 01:30:47,326
Goodbye.

953
01:30:54,350 --> 01:30:56,699
Can make a U turn up ahead?

954
01:31:17,002 --> 01:31:20,269
- You took long!
- call to tell you was going to be late

955
01:31:20,432 --> 01:31:25,855
The guy couldn't answer me.

956
01:31:28,926 --> 01:31:30,753
Where's your chador?

957
01:31:32,317 --> 01:31:36,299
Let's go.
I'll explain later.

958
01:31:45,436 --> 01:31:48,227
What did you do?
You look even more beautiful.

959
01:31:50,463 --> 01:31:52,050
Went to a beauty salon.

960
01:31:57,480 --> 01:31:59,590
It's at the guy's house
where worked.

961
01:32:01,508 --> 01:32:03,494
Poor guy brought you
all the way here!

962
01:32:07,051 --> 01:32:12,111
- How can thank you?
- Don't mention it.

963
01:32:12,435 --> 01:32:14,659
My wife made me drive her.

964
01:32:14,828 --> 01:32:17,495
Your wife's chador is at our home.

965
01:32:17,660 --> 01:32:20,087
Keep it, it's not a problem.

966
01:32:21,449 --> 01:32:25,554
- Happy New Year.
- Thanks a lot.

967
01:32:41,827 --> 01:32:44,652
It's cold.

968
01:33:22,505 --> 01:33:24,931
- How are you?
- Fine, thank you.

969
01:33:25,216 --> 01:33:28,280
- You really don't want to come up?
- Thank you.

970
01:33:28,447 --> 01:33:31,476
It's cold out, don't be polite.

971
01:33:31,637 --> 01:33:33,621
No, really.

972
01:34:34,407 --> 01:34:36,711
Darling, why are you sleeping here?

973
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:38,747
Come back to bed.
