00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:39,196
DIGITALLY RESTORED IN 2016

2
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:57,090
A few years ago, the painter Johan Borg
disappeared without a trace

3
00:00:57,182 --> 00:01:02,268
from his home on Baltrum
in the Frisian Islands.

4
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:08,146
His wife, Alma,
subsequently left me Johan's diary,

5
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:12,696
which she had found among his papers.

6
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:14,738
It is this diary
along with Alma's verbal account

7
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:16,487
that make up the basis for this film.

8
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:18,864
<i>Can somebody move that chair?</i>

9
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:21,070
<i>Can you lower it a little?</i>

10
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:22,951
HOUR OF THE WOLF

11
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,658
A FILM BY
INGMAR BERGMAN

12
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:30,539
<i>Have you been down there?</i>

13
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:22,637
<i>Quiet! Ready for take!</i>

14
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,888
<i>Camera!</i>

15
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:31,432
<i>Action!</i>

16
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:15,277
No. I have nothing more to tell.

17
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,491
I've given you the diary.

18
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:29,282
You're wondering
why I'm going to stay here.

19
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:34,253
We've lived together in this house
for almost seven years.

20
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:40,130
Come winter, I can move to the mainland
and work in the store.

21
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:44,134
I've done it in previous years
when we were short on money.

22
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:53,647
The doctor said
the baby's due in a month.

23
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:58,695
I had an examination in May,
before the last time we came out here.

24
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:05,326
I remember it was a Friday.

25
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:10,202
It was pretty late. About 10:00, I think.

26
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:14,585
But it was still light out.

27
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:22,506
We had planned to stay here until August.

28
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:27,090
We were going to be completely alone.

29
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,560
He didn't want to see
another human being here.

30
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,512
He was scared.

31
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:47,194
He liked that I was quiet.

32
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:51,364
He liked...

33
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,792
We arrived at about 3:00 in the morning.

34
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:06,175
We found a cart in a shed on the beach.

35
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:14,100
When we got here, we were happy to see
that the apple tree was in bloom.

36
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:18,149
Then we discovered footprints

37
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:20,192
in the flower bed
under the kitchen window.

38
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:25,069
Johan became irritated,
but we forgot about it until...

39
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,407
We were happy.

40
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:38,665
We were happy to be back home again.

41
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,963
Johan was a bit worried.

42
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:46,669
He was always worried
when work wasn't going well

43
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:49,255
and lately it hadn't been.

44
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:54,760
He struggled to sleep.

45
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,643
He was frightened,

46
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:59,815
as if scared of the dark.

47
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:06,197
It had gotten worse the last few years.

48
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,052
- I know.
- What?

49
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:24,853
- I'm going to draw you.
- No.

50
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:25,975
- Yes.
- No.

51
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,557
Yes, let me.

52
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,437
If you sit over there.

53
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,814
Come on now. Up you go, fatty.

54
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,275
- Here?
- A bit farther back. There.

55
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,577
- Are you cold?
- No.

56
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:42,492
I knew that.

57
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:46,292
No, sit like you usually do.
Don't straighten your back.

58
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:49,290
And pull the robe off of your shoulder.

59
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:56,294
Like that. And pull your hair up
so I can see your neck better.

60
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:01,549
Just like that. Where are my glasses?

61
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:05,432
The temple is broken again.

62
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,726
Just like that.
Can you sit still like that?

63
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:20,493
If I patiently drew you, day after day...

64
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,449
Hi.

65
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:59,671
Look here.

66
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,929
I haven't shown these to anybody.

67
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:06,007
You see, I've drawn them.

68
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:11,596
This is the most common figure.
He's almost harmless.

69
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,765
I think he's homosexual.

70
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,819
Then there's the old lady.

71
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:22,444
Who's always threatening
to take off her hat.

72
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,695
- You know what happens then?
- No.

73
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:27,695
Her face comes off with it, you see.

74
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:32,662
Here.

75
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:35,874
This is the worst one.

76
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,498
I call him the Bird Man.

77
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:42,835
I don't know if it's a real beak
or if it's only a mask.

78
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:47,222
He's so remarkably fast.

79
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:51,261
He must be related
to Papageno from <i>The Magic Flute.</i>

80
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:58,980
The others.
The flesh eaters, the insects...

81
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:02,647
and especially the spider men.

82
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:04,902
Here.

83
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:07,781
The schoolmaster
with the pointing stick in his trousers.

84
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:15,910
And the... chattering,
hard-as-metal women.

85
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,795
You have to stay awake a while.

86
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:37,059
In an hour or so it'll be day.

87
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,605
Then I can sleep.

88
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,766
A minute really is
an immense amount of time.

89
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:15,970
Starting now.

90
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:26,355
Ten seconds.

91
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,499
These seconds...

92
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:46,212
See how long they last?

93
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:55,676
The minute is not up yet.

94
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,738
Finally.

95
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,579
Now it's passed.

96
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:30,712
Say something. Eh?

97
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:32,512
Talk to me, Alma.

98
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:42,436
You know, there's something
I've been thinking for quite a while.

99
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:46,485
Are you listening?

100
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,992
We've lived together for seven years now.

101
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,412
No, that's not what I was going to say.

102
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,490
Now I know.

103
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:04,788
Is it not true that old people,
who've spent a lifetime together,

104
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:06,873
start to resemble each other?

105
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:11,757
Eventually they have so much in common

106
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:14,213
that they not only
have the same thoughts,

107
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,549
but the same facial expressions.

108
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:21,186
Why do you think that is?

109
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:33,074
I hope we become so old
that we share each other's thoughts...

110
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:41,453
and that we get little, dry
and completely identical wrinkled faces.

111
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,703
What do you think of that?

112
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,623
Are you sleeping?

113
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:54,670
Come. Come, let's go.

114
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,131
Come, let's go to bed.

115
00:16:58,059 --> 00:16:59,800
- Come on.
- Yes.

116
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:01,935
Yes.

117
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:31,062
Don't look so frightened, dear child.

118
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:33,064
I'm not dangerous.

119
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,570
Give me your hand.

120
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:39,867
Well? Can you feel my hand now?

121
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:45,030
My fingers, the veins under my skin.

122
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,951
At my age, the hands are a bit cold.

123
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:52,875
I'm 216 years old after all.

124
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:56,091
No, what am I saying?

125
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,835
Seventy-six, I mean.

126
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:05,555
No, I better move on.

127
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:10,309
Wait! What was it I was going to say?

128
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:12,732
Yes, now I remember.

129
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:17,313
In his black satchel under the bed,

130
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:21,025
is his sketchbook with the drawings...

131
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:25,078
He wants to tear them up.

132
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:29,158
Tell him not to do it.

133
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,536
And one more thing.

134
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:36,214
He hides his diary in that same satchel.

135
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,132
Read it.

136
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,968
No. No!

137
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,183
DIARY

138
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:27,617
<i>Wednesday, July 22nd. I've just been ill.</i>

139
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:30,992
<i>Not too bad, but still unpleasant enough.</i>

140
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:11,035
Forgive my interruption,
but I've contemplated for days

141
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:13,408
the best way to approach you.

142
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,579
I decided it's most polite
to get straight to the point.

143
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:19,207
My name is von Merkens,
Baron von Merkens.

144
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:20,412
Borg.

145
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:22,964
As you may know, I own this island

146
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,838
and I live in the old castle
on the north side.

147
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:30,764
Would you and your wife be interested
in a simple family supper at our place?

148
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,807
That's very kind of you.

149
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,885
It will be very simple,

150
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:38,563
but I can offer good wine
and our salmon fishing is renowned.

151
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:43,443
Good-bye.

152
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:48,941
Yes, and I should probably mention
that my wife and I are admirers of yours.

153
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,993
I might even dare say
your fondest admirers.

154
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:16,305
<i>Thursday, July 27th.</i>

155
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:19,559
<i>A very warm, hazy day.</i>

156
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:23,354
<i>I still feel unwell after my illness.</i>

157
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,389
Do you see this mark?

158
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:40,386
You have to be more careful, my love,

159
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,641
or it will end in disaster.

160
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:45,098
Don't you remember?

161
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:48,685
I was going to a party and I was
wearing my green brocade dress.

162
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:52,068
And afterwards I had trouble
putting up my hair again.

163
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:55,071
And I forgot my gloves.

164
00:24:57,663 --> 00:25:00,280
I have something
I need to speak to you about.

165
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:05,581
I've received a letter
that I need to show you.

166
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:08,000
It was sent yesterday.

167
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:10,503
It goes like this:

168
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:14,719
"You don't see us, but we see you.

169
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:17,423
The worst can happen.

170
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:21,385
Dreams can be revealed.

171
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:23,640
The end is near.

172
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,977
The wells will run dry,

173
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:31,190
and other liquids
will moisten your white loins.

174
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:33,654
So it has been decided."

175
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:38,864
I nearly got ill reading it.

176
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,533
Your hands are really hot.

177
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,667
Do you have a fever?

178
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:54,592
I always get so excited
when I'm going to meet you.

179
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,635
Can you understand that?

180
00:25:57,765 --> 00:26:01,349
It's as if I'm in a dream all afternoon.

181
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:05,971
All chores feel unreal and meaningless.

182
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:14,653
Be so sweet and help me with my zipper.

183
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,777
It always gets stuck.

184
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:13,456
It's really windy,
but beautiful, don't you think?

185
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:16,883
This has to be a dream spot for painting.

186
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:20,170
You've lived here for quite some time.

187
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:24,429
You return to the scene of the crime,
so to speak. And commit new crimes.

188
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,768
You look tired. Don't overexert yourself.

189
00:27:27,855 --> 00:27:30,814
I mean, at our age
some caution is advised.

190
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:33,186
Youth is much hardier.

191
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:35,727
I know what I'm talking about.

192
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:37,938
My name is Heerbrand, school counselor.

193
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:41,741
I probe people's souls
and turn the inside out.

194
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:44,535
And what do we see?
Well, I don't need to tell you.

195
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:47,489
You're an artist,
you know the human heart.

196
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:51,577
Who hasn't seen your facial studies,
not to mention your self-portraits?

197
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:54,959
Why do you look at me like that?
Are you angry?

198
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:57,506
Are your nerves all right?
Is something bothering you?

199
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:02,129
Shut up! Shut up!

200
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,207
I need to ask you for a little more money.

201
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:19,960
What you gave me
earlier this month is almost gone.

202
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:23,418
I have to pay the store
next time we go to the mainland.

203
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:28,966
The bill is 176.50,
and then there's the milk.

204
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:35,639
No, don't just fork over money like that,
take a look at my accounting.

205
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:38,562
It's actually important, at least for me.

206
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:42,937
I received 500 on the third.

207
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:46,866
You got me that blanket.
It was rather expensive, it cost 35.

208
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:50,369
But it's nice and warm
when you're lying alone.

209
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:53,619
And then there's the last bill
from the store.

210
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:57,328
It was high because we had to buy
flour, sugar and canned goods.

211
00:29:57,421 --> 00:30:00,459
It was over 200 kronor... 219.

212
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:07,420
And then there's
pocket money and stamps,

213
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:11,508
a chain for my bicycle
and new batteries for the radio...

214
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:14,844
and the potato peeler.

215
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:21,731
There's soap, washing detergent
and a nail brush.

216
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:25,188
You need to buy a new toothbrush.
The one you have looks terrible.

217
00:30:25,282 --> 00:30:27,274
- Yes.
- Yes, it does.

218
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:37,042
Then 50 kronor for your boy's birthday
and 0.75 for postage.

219
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:42,168
That leaves 7.36 out of 500.

220
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:49,045
You can check it to see if it's correct.

221
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:07,443
- We're invited to the castle on Friday.
- I know.

222
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:12,569
How do you know that?

223
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,325
Good day.

224
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:22,211
Let me present my wife, Corinne.

225
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,414
You're most welcome. Welcome.

226
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:26,921
My mother, Countess von Merkens.

227
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:30,260
My brother, Ernst.

228
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,552
A pleasure. It's a pleasure.

229
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:36,009
This is archivist Lindhorst.

230
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:39,555
It's nice to meet you.
I am one of your fondest admirers.

231
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:42,061
And this is Counselor Heerbrand.

232
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:44,642
Pleasure. Yes, we've met before.

233
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,568
Would you like a drink?

234
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:06,714
I thought you'd been living here
for months.

235
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,338
We've heard of you for so long.

236
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:11,841
Time flies so quickly.

237
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,263
We're so happy you wanted to come.

238
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:24,311
What an awful maidservant.
But she's cheap, of course.

239
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:27,690
My brother can't afford better.
Please observe that the reason the soup...

240
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:31,068
Quiet, dear Ernst.
Nowadays we're homebodies.

241
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:33,491
In the past we traveled a lot.
Do you like travel?

242
00:32:33,577 --> 00:32:36,536
I love to travel.
There's nothing more stimulating.

243
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,783
Alma is an unusual and beautiful name.

244
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:41,457
Personally, I'm unable to feel aggression.

245
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:43,751
Well, I can manage
some bureaucratic vengefulness.

246
00:32:43,837 --> 00:32:45,578
In this house we're used to humiliation.

247
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:47,755
It's supposed to be pleasurable
to be humiliated.

248
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:49,521
- We still have our fangs intact.
- Cheers!

249
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:52,089
These days I want to be loved...

250
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:55,468
I bought a painting
from a then well-known artist...

251
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:56,889
No comments, dear Ernst.

252
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:59,012
Then I hung it upside down in my salon

253
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:03,813
and invited the artist over
with others who appreciated a good joke.

254
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:07,142
We had a good laugh at the time.
God, how we laughed.

255
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:10,023
What do you say, Mr. Artist?
Wasn't that a funny joke?

256
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:15,116
The wounds never heal,
the pus never ceases to flow.

257
00:33:15,202 --> 00:33:16,363
The infection is constant.

258
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:19,992
Then it goes faster or slower
towards the end.

259
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:22,915
The determining factor
is the heart's resistance.

260
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:27,666
I'm constantly losing weight.
I travel the world consulting specialists.

261
00:33:27,756 --> 00:33:32,751
Sometimes it stops as it has this summer,
but then it starts up again.

262
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:36,929
My husband says it's psychological,
that it started when we lost our money.

263
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:39,928
When I embezzled the family money.
I'm the guilty one.

264
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:42,510
- Please don't start.
- My dishonesty.

265
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:47,269
Why is Lindhorst at our table?
Why can't we sell and leave?

266
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:51,694
My fault. My fault.
All this suffering. My fault!

267
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:56,024
And then I shouted,
"Your medicine is worthless.

268
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:59,235
It won't go away. It will never go away.

269
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:02,822
You must remove it during operation.
Cut it out.

270
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:06,455
No, I'm an old woman.
There has to be some limit."

271
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:09,959
Then the professor laughed and said,

272
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:15,669
"No, Countess,
I've never heard of any limits."

273
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:20,009
Yes, we have children. Two boys.

274
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:23,593
Not here. Oh, no, they live with an uncle.

275
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:26,475
They're acquaintances of yours,
by the way.

276
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:30,855
I believe you know Veronica Vogler.
Very well from what I hear.

277
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,728
An incredibly beautiful woman.

278
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:37,691
Veronica Vogler is a charming woman.
Have you met her? Really very charming.

279
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:39,696
No?

280
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:42,362
Such hatred in those eyes.

281
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:53,331
Fredrik, the cacti
you planted in the park need to go.

282
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:56,088
My cats don't like them at all.

283
00:35:24,998 --> 00:35:27,911
We'll have coffee in the library.

284
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:56,602
Help me a little.

285
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,339
Ladies and gentlemen.

286
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:24,843
May I present a puppet theater
performance as a pleasant diversion?

287
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:27,466
Shall we turn off the lights?

288
00:36:29,062 --> 00:36:30,803
There we go.

289
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:34,231
Our guests of honor.

290
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:36,980
Come. Come.

291
00:36:38,947 --> 00:36:40,563
There.

292
00:36:58,633 --> 00:36:59,749
Music.

293
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:43,520
<i>The Magic Flute</i> is the prime example.
One moment and I'll prove it to you.

294
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:50,075
Tamino's guide has just left him
in the dark palace courtyard

295
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:52,153
outside the Temple of Wisdom.

296
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:54,701
And the young man cries out in despair:

297
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:57,875
"O eternal night,
when will you come to an end?

298
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:02,375
When shall the light find my eyes?"

299
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:08,670
The fatally ill Mozart
secretly sympathizes with these words.

300
00:39:09,556 --> 00:39:12,139
The reply from the choir
and orchestra is also,

301
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:17,179
"Soon, soon, youth, or never."

302
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:26,066
The most beautiful,
most significant music ever written.

303
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,864
Tamino asks:

304
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:32,068
"Is Pamina still alive?"

305
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,537
The invisible choir answers,

306
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:38,870
"Pamina. Pamina is still alive."

307
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:47,417
Listen to the strange, illogical
but ingenious division of the word:

308
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:51,887
Pami... na.

309
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:56,266
Pami... na.

310
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,687
This is no longer
the name of a young woman.

311
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:05,985
It's a spell, an incantation.

312
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:10,235
A naive text...
In short, a commissioned piece of music...

313
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:14,156
and yet the greatest manifestation of art.

314
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,453
Isn't that so, Mr. Artist?

315
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:21,875
Forgive me. I call myself artist
for lack of a better term.

316
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:27,168
In my creativity nothing is self-evident,
except the compulsion to carry on.

317
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,170
Through no intent of my own,

318
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,968
I have been singled out
as something special,

319
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:34,422
a five-legged calf, a monster.

320
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:39,351
I never strove for that distinction,
nor do I strive to keep it.

321
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,053
But by all means,

322
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:44,436
I have felt megalomania
brush across my brow.

323
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:46,482
But I believe myself to be immune.

324
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:48,811
I need only for a moment

325
00:40:48,905 --> 00:40:52,398
consider the insignificance
of art in the human world

326
00:40:52,492 --> 00:40:54,529
to be brought back down to earth.

327
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:57,824
However, that doesn't inhibit
the compulsion.

328
00:40:57,914 --> 00:41:00,702
- Spoken by a true artist.
- This is a true confession.

329
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:03,500
- Magnificent.
- Such courage. Such insight.

330
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:05,248
I propose a toast to our artist.

331
00:41:05,338 --> 00:41:07,796
He's not only a genius,
but a deep thinker as well.

332
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:09,794
I'll be damned. I didn't expect that.

333
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:12,797
A flowering rose for your hair.

334
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:16,847
I must have gotten your cheek
with my fingernail.

335
00:41:16,933 --> 00:41:20,267
Let's see. Oh, you're bleeding.
Here's my handkerchief.

336
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:23,346
- No, it's clean.
- Our artist has been wounded.

337
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:26,603
Imagine that I would be so clumsy.

338
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:32,233
Be calm. You've had too much to drink.

339
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,406
Stay with me now.

340
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:37,109
He doesn't sleep at night.
That's why he can't handle too much.

341
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:39,536
Come, let's get some air.

342
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:46,376
The castle's core
is actually from the 1400s.

343
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:49,709
It's belonged to the family
since the late 1500s.

344
00:41:49,799 --> 00:41:53,463
We got a little excited.
It's no wonder, we are so isolated here.

345
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:56,762
We simply frightened you.
But now you won't leave us, will you?

346
00:41:56,848 --> 00:41:59,841
See, Corinne,
at night our castle is rather beautiful.

347
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:01,926
Yes, it would be at night.

348
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:06,810
My garter! No, no.
Turn away, Counselor Heerbrand.

349
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:09,312
Where did Ernst go?
Ernst, my friend, where are you?

350
00:42:09,402 --> 00:42:14,614
I went off a little. I'm ashamed
that the park is so neglected.

351
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:17,783
Imagine 10 years ago,
a pristine park visited...

352
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:20,657
We never kiss each other.
Have you thought of that?

353
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:24,247
I can almost count our kisses.

354
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:26,791
There is something
that scares me to death.

355
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,662
I meet a stranger on the road.

356
00:42:29,756 --> 00:42:32,294
We converse about this and that.

357
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:36,093
Suddenly he turns towards me
and delivers a hard blow to my cheek.

358
00:42:36,763 --> 00:42:40,427
His face is deathly pale,
his eyes filled with hate.

359
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:44,639
I don't understand anything.
I just feel sick and get a nosebleed.

360
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:48,723
I sputter some silly excuses...
Terribly shaken.

361
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:51,937
And after the man has disappeared,
I ask myself,

362
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:55,066
"Is this how it is?
Does it have to be like this?"

363
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:58,274
I'll never forget the man's eyes.

364
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:01,531
It's nothing to worry about.

365
00:43:01,621 --> 00:43:05,991
The punch was horrible,
but his eyes were the worst.

366
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:09,584
Leaving already?

367
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:14,381
Before you go, you have to see where
I hung your painting of Veronica Vogler.

368
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:16,129
Alma, dear, come along.

369
00:43:16,219 --> 00:43:18,176
She's sleeping. Let's not bother her.

370
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:20,049
No, I'm not sleeping.

371
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:23,598
- I think we should go now.
- Then come both of you.

372
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:25,050
It won't take long.

373
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:30,022
Alma, you're going to see something
very beautiful your husband has made.

374
00:43:30,525 --> 00:43:32,107
Here's the painting,

375
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:34,605
directly across from my bed.

376
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:37,062
I can see it every morning and night.

377
00:43:37,824 --> 00:43:40,532
It's become part of my lonely life.

378
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,614
I love her.

379
00:43:50,503 --> 00:43:52,745
How long did you live together?

380
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:55,081
Forgive me for asking
something so personal.

381
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:57,173
- Five years.
- Really?

382
00:43:58,052 --> 00:43:59,543
He's told you?

383
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:02,175
He loved her, didn't he?

384
00:44:02,849 --> 00:44:04,636
I don't need to ask.

385
00:44:05,935 --> 00:44:08,473
It was a first-rate scandal at the time.

386
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:11,142
But so romantic.

387
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,641
Jealous?

388
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:17,026
- I don't believe so.
- My husband is quite jealous.

389
00:44:17,113 --> 00:44:19,446
He's an excellent lover.

390
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:23,283
Look at this mark, by the way.

391
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:27,746
It's a scar from another man's,
shall we say, advances.

392
00:44:27,832 --> 00:44:30,620
An eternal spring of renewed excitement.

393
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:37,339
All of it is very trivial, of course,
but for me it's stimulating.

394
00:44:37,425 --> 00:44:39,291
Soon I'll have to come up with
something new.

395
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:42,503
That scar won't remain
fascinating forever.

396
00:44:42,597 --> 00:44:44,338
Can you help me?

397
00:44:44,432 --> 00:44:46,719
Alma, dear, don't get angry.

398
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:49,222
I'm only kidding.

399
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:51,223
It was a silly joke.

400
00:44:51,314 --> 00:44:53,397
Come now. Let's go join the others.

401
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:02,272
I have at least bought a fairly
significant piece of your husband.

402
00:45:04,285 --> 00:45:06,242
Don't you think?

403
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:30,100
I should tell you
that I've read your diary,

404
00:45:30,186 --> 00:45:32,769
and I'm almost sick with fear.

405
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:35,313
Wait! Let me finish talking.

406
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:38,517
I want you to hear what I've been
thinking these past few days.

407
00:45:38,611 --> 00:45:40,318
This is what I've been thinking.

408
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:43,192
I can see something is going to happen,
something evil.

409
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:45,774
I don't know what to call it.

410
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:49,323
But if you think I'm going to run away...

411
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:52,451
I'm not going to run away,
no matter how frightened I am.

412
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:56,159
And one more thing.

413
00:45:56,254 --> 00:45:59,964
They want to separate us.
They want you for themselves.

414
00:46:00,049 --> 00:46:02,712
As long as I'm with you,
it'll be more difficult.

415
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:05,095
Johan.

416
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:09,472
I'm not going to run away,
no matter what they try.

417
00:46:10,268 --> 00:46:12,851
I'll stay, I will. I'll stay.

418
00:46:14,355 --> 00:46:16,392
Johan, answer me.

419
00:46:51,434 --> 00:46:53,517
Johan!

420
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:10,076
HOUR OF THE WOLF

421
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:54,828
- Do you hear how quiet it is?
- Yes, it's quiet.

422
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:04,375
There was a time
when nights were for sleep.

423
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:08,379
A deep, dreamless sleep.

424
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:11,298
Imagine, sleeping.

425
00:48:12,098 --> 00:48:14,181
Waking up without fear.

426
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:18,010
- Alma?
- Yes.

427
00:48:19,647 --> 00:48:23,561
- Are you tired?
- No, not terribly.

428
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:27,519
Now we've kept watch
every night until dawn.

429
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:33,074
This hour is the most difficult.

430
00:48:36,122 --> 00:48:38,114
- Do you know what it's called?
- No.

431
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:41,874
Old people used to call it
the "hour of the wolf."

432
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:45,165
It's the hour when the most people die,

433
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:47,964
when the most babies are born.

434
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:50,964
It's the hour when nightmares come to us.

435
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:55,426
- And if we are awake...
- We are afraid.

436
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:58,258
We are afraid.

437
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:05,982
What is it?

438
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:09,277
It's nothing. I just thought of something
from my childhood.

439
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:14,650
It was some sort of punishment, you see.

440
00:49:15,703 --> 00:49:17,695
They threw me in the closet

441
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:20,072
and shut the door.

442
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:22,908
It got dark and quiet.

443
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:25,835
I became terribly frightened.

444
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:28,129
I kicked and I pounded,

445
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:32,550
because they had told me
that a little person lived in that closet.

446
00:49:34,472 --> 00:49:39,012
And he could gnaw the toes off
of naughty children.

447
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:45,768
When I stopped pounding
I heard something rattling in the corner

448
00:49:45,858 --> 00:49:48,100
and I knew my time had come.

449
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:52,358
And in some sort of silent panic,

450
00:49:52,448 --> 00:49:56,112
I started climbing
on shoe boxes and shelves.

451
00:49:56,202 --> 00:49:59,286
I tried pulling myself up by my hands,

452
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:01,408
clothes falling all around me,

453
00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:03,741
I lost my grip and I fell.

454
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:05,996
I swung my fists wildly all around me

455
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:08,624
to defend myself
against that little creature.

456
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:12,875
And the entire time
I screamed in horror

457
00:50:13,594 --> 00:50:15,381
and asked for forgiveness.

458
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:19,339
Finally the door opened
and I could step out...

459
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:22,224
into the daylight.

460
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:25,720
My father said,

461
00:50:26,357 --> 00:50:29,065
"Mother tells me
that you beg for forgiveness."

462
00:50:29,902 --> 00:50:33,771
And I said,
"Yes, I beg so much for forgiveness."

463
00:50:35,074 --> 00:50:38,158
"Prepare the couch then," he said.

464
00:50:39,245 --> 00:50:42,454
I went to the green couch
in my father's room,

465
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:47,786
picked up some pillows
and stacked them on top of each other.

466
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:52,251
Then I went and fetched the cane,
unbuttoned my pants

467
00:50:52,341 --> 00:50:55,049
and laid down over the pillows.

468
00:50:56,762 --> 00:51:01,427
Father asked,
"How many strokes do you deserve?"

469
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:06,644
And I said, "As many strokes as possible."

470
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:10,640
And he struck me with the cane,

471
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:14,523
pretty hard, but not unbearable.

472
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:24,322
When the punishment was over
I turned towards Mother and asked,

473
00:51:24,415 --> 00:51:26,247
"Can Mother forgive me now?"

474
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:32,204
And she cried, and said,
"Of course I forgive you."

475
00:51:35,009 --> 00:51:37,592
Then she offered me her hand...

476
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:41,050
and I kissed it.

477
00:51:50,691 --> 00:51:55,026
Alma, are you listening?
Are you sleeping?

478
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:57,149
No, I'm awake.

479
00:51:58,866 --> 00:52:01,108
My back hurts.

480
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:05,953
Can you believe
that it's pitch-black out there still?

481
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:10,120
Do you hear how quiet it is?

482
00:52:11,295 --> 00:52:14,663
It's strange
when the sea is completely calm.

483
00:52:15,424 --> 00:52:17,131
Scary somehow.

484
00:52:17,718 --> 00:52:19,254
Don't you think?

485
00:52:19,345 --> 00:52:20,836
Are you crying?

486
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:22,136
No, I'm not.

487
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:26,182
I'm thinking of the child...

488
00:52:27,186 --> 00:52:30,179
and of this great, silent darkness.

489
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:33,394
It's almost as if
it will never be light again.

490
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:35,775
My poor dear.

491
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:39,020
Give me your hand.

492
00:52:41,784 --> 00:52:43,821
That's much better.

493
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:53,209
Remember that day I came home
and said I'd been bitten by a snake?

494
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:55,002
Yes.

495
00:52:56,882 --> 00:52:58,794
It was no snake bite.

496
00:52:59,927 --> 00:53:01,839
It wasn't a snake bite?

497
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:07,720
I never thought I'd tell anybody.
I don't even know if...

498
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:10,718
You need to tell me.

499
00:53:11,772 --> 00:53:13,604
You can never tell anybody.

500
00:53:13,691 --> 00:53:17,480
No, I promise. I'll never tell anybody.

501
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:20,361
You remember the place by the cliffs?

502
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:22,985
- We were there early this summer.
- Yes.

503
00:59:48,043 --> 00:59:50,000
Did you lock it properly?

504
00:59:50,087 --> 00:59:52,204
I checked it twice.

505
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:04,135
Good morning.

506
01:00:04,226 --> 01:00:06,559
Sorry to disturb you. A thousand pardons.

507
01:00:07,813 --> 01:00:11,727
It looks like a storm is coming,
so I thought I'd stop in for a while.

508
01:00:12,484 --> 01:00:14,692
I have an errand as well.

509
01:00:15,654 --> 01:00:19,068
May I sit down?
I promise I won't be long-winded.

510
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,986
I'm here with an invitation
from the castle.

511
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:26,912
We're going to have a little party.

512
01:00:26,998 --> 01:00:29,411
Nothing big at all.

513
01:00:29,501 --> 01:00:31,868
Just something
to distract those poor people a bit.

514
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:34,329
They sit there year round
and harp on each other.

515
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:37,085
As I said, not a large party.

516
01:00:37,926 --> 01:00:40,509
But it will interest you.

517
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:43,838
Veronica Vogler has accepted.
She'll be there.

518
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:46,883
And you'll come as well, won't you?

519
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:49,093
Then it's agreed.

520
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:54,144
By the way, Von Merkens and I
discussed the other day

521
01:00:54,234 --> 01:00:56,191
your ability to defend yourself.

522
01:00:56,278 --> 01:00:59,692
I mean, against all the small game
on the island.

523
01:01:01,908 --> 01:01:03,865
That's all for the moment.

524
01:01:03,952 --> 01:01:07,161
Good morning, dear friends.
Hope to see you at our little party.

525
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:15,753
Shouldn't you lock up that weapon?

526
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:17,455
No, why?

527
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:23,594
What are we going to do now?

528
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:28,053
You're going to tell me
about Veronica Vogler.

529
01:01:33,064 --> 01:01:35,272
What do you want me to tell you?

530
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:37,099
That it went on for five years?

531
01:01:37,652 --> 01:01:39,018
You know that.

532
01:01:39,112 --> 01:01:41,195
We were caught. It was a huge scandal.

533
01:01:41,281 --> 01:01:42,988
Then the story quieted down.

534
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:44,700
Then it ended.

535
01:01:45,285 --> 01:01:47,572
That's not what it says in your diary.

536
01:01:55,337 --> 01:01:58,876
"My attachment to Veronica
finally became agonizing for both of us.

537
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:03,251
I followed her and spied on her jealously.

538
01:02:03,345 --> 01:02:06,179
I believe my passion stimulated her,

539
01:02:06,264 --> 01:02:08,881
but she was always passive
and indecisive.

540
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:11,262
Sometimes we had frightening disputes

541
01:02:11,353 --> 01:02:13,891
that lacked any semblance of reason.

542
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:18,566
We traveled from town to town
to evade her relatives and lawyers."

543
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:22,319
No!

544
01:02:26,201 --> 01:02:28,488
"We truly embodied the words of the Bible

545
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:31,616
that man and woman
shall be of one flesh.

546
01:02:33,041 --> 01:02:35,658
Then her husband came to get her.

547
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:37,994
I was taken to the hospital.

548
01:02:38,088 --> 01:02:40,296
We didn't see each other
for several years."

549
01:02:47,138 --> 01:02:49,380
You once said...

550
01:02:50,475 --> 01:02:55,891
that the nice thing about me
was that God had made me in one piece.

551
01:03:00,193 --> 01:03:03,357
That I had whole feelings
and whole thoughts.

552
01:03:05,657 --> 01:03:09,526
You said it was important
that there were people like me.

553
01:03:12,914 --> 01:03:15,281
I thought it sounded so lovely.

554
01:03:16,501 --> 01:03:18,367
It made me so happy.

555
01:03:20,714 --> 01:03:22,330
I was wrong.

556
01:03:24,843 --> 01:03:26,675
I don't understand a thing.

557
01:03:30,098 --> 01:03:33,591
I don't understand a thing.
I don't understand you.

558
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:36,931
Now I'm only frightened.

559
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:42,396
Do you think I want to stay here
and possibly be killed?

560
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:47,901
Do you think I want to see you
running after that woman,

561
01:03:47,991 --> 01:03:50,608
talking to ghosts,
while I defend myself constantly?

562
01:03:50,702 --> 01:03:52,409
Do you think I want that?

563
01:03:55,373 --> 01:03:56,989
But here I am.

564
01:04:45,006 --> 01:04:46,998
Get up from the table now.

565
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:59,426
Now go over to the door.

566
01:05:02,982 --> 01:05:04,564
Now walk through the door.

567
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:07,275
Walk down the steps.

568
01:05:07,362 --> 01:05:09,399
It's not dark anymore,
you'll find your way.

569
01:05:36,433 --> 01:05:39,301
No, how lovely!

570
01:05:39,394 --> 01:05:41,306
Welcome.

571
01:05:41,396 --> 01:05:43,683
Be a dear and carry the tray.

572
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:44,934
There you go.

573
01:05:45,024 --> 01:05:48,483
Thank you. It's my evening meal, you see.

574
01:05:49,154 --> 01:05:51,271
Lindhorst, who's wise
in the way of the world,

575
01:05:51,364 --> 01:05:53,606
claims that old harlots
have an obsessive need

576
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:56,488
of satisfying the mouth and stomach.

577
01:05:58,872 --> 01:06:00,909
Are you sure you do not want any?

578
01:06:00,999 --> 01:06:02,831
Isn't there a party this evening?

579
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:05,208
Not as far as I know.

580
01:06:06,838 --> 01:06:10,002
No, no. Don't go.

581
01:06:12,927 --> 01:06:15,089
Please help me remove my stockings.

582
01:06:18,183 --> 01:06:20,220
You don't like touching me.

583
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:23,185
I can sense it clearly.

584
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:25,770
I don't understand you.

585
01:06:27,192 --> 01:06:29,900
Veronica Vogler has arrived...

586
01:06:31,488 --> 01:06:34,322
and I'm the only one
who can tell you where she is.

587
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:39,697
Look closely at my feet, Mr. Artist.

588
01:06:39,787 --> 01:06:43,906
Have you ever seen
more youthful and fit arches?

589
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,333
Look closely. Look at my heel.

590
01:06:46,419 --> 01:06:48,627
It's so smooth and nice.

591
01:06:49,214 --> 01:06:53,458
And the strong toes and beautiful nails.

592
01:06:53,551 --> 01:06:55,167
Kiss my foot.

593
01:06:55,261 --> 01:06:57,253
Go on now.

594
01:06:58,181 --> 01:07:00,093
There you go.

595
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:02,724
You've been kind,

596
01:07:03,269 --> 01:07:06,933
so I'll tell you where she is.

597
01:07:10,401 --> 01:07:13,235
Look in the west gallery.

598
01:07:13,321 --> 01:07:16,564
At least she was there five minutes ago.

599
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:54,147
- Forgive me, I thought...
- You're always welcome, dear friend.

600
01:07:54,696 --> 01:07:58,155
You come, you stay, you go.
You have complete freedom.

601
01:07:59,117 --> 01:08:00,983
Let us speak candidly.

602
01:08:01,661 --> 01:08:03,869
You're here looking for Veronica Vogler.

603
01:08:05,415 --> 01:08:10,535
I should mention, before you meet her,
that Veronica has been my lover for years.

604
01:08:11,462 --> 01:08:15,923
Your shared past
has kindly been detailed for me.

605
01:08:17,051 --> 01:08:19,384
I can assure you I'm suffering.

606
01:08:20,638 --> 01:08:22,846
Tonight I shall be by your bed.

607
01:08:23,850 --> 01:08:26,684
Every word, every kiss,
every movement of your bodies...

608
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:29,011
I will be spared nothing.

609
01:08:29,731 --> 01:08:31,518
Come, I'll show you the way.

610
01:09:13,566 --> 01:09:16,604
It's only my jealousy.
Please go away.

611
01:09:17,945 --> 01:09:19,356
Yes, of course.

612
01:09:19,447 --> 01:09:21,564
Of course. Naturally.

613
01:10:15,795 --> 01:10:18,583
It's Conductor Kreisler playing.

614
01:10:21,509 --> 01:10:25,753
Conductor Kreisler
is a master of his instrument.

615
01:10:30,727 --> 01:10:33,720
Don't you think Veronica
has waited long enough?

616
01:10:34,439 --> 01:10:37,807
She started to prepare for your visit
early this morning.

617
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:42,151
She's become even more beautiful.

618
01:10:43,322 --> 01:10:44,858
My husband is suffering.

619
01:10:45,491 --> 01:10:47,073
He's jealous.

620
01:10:49,162 --> 01:10:51,654
And your touching little companion...

621
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:55,203
Three shots, one of which was fatal.

622
01:10:56,919 --> 01:10:59,912
Such lovely music.

623
01:11:01,507 --> 01:11:05,672
I think I must remove my hat,
so I can hear better.

624
01:11:25,615 --> 01:11:27,948
It really smells of glue.

625
01:11:28,034 --> 01:11:30,947
Though she insists it's all synthetic.

626
01:11:31,037 --> 01:11:33,780
But regular glue is what it is.
She doesn't fool me.

627
01:12:00,525 --> 01:12:02,482
We know our tricks, don't we?

628
01:12:02,568 --> 01:12:05,356
Let's see if we're presentable.

629
01:12:05,446 --> 01:12:09,656
You're so pale, dear friend.
What a sight you are.

630
01:12:09,742 --> 01:12:13,486
Your lips are as blue as blueberries.
We have to do something about that. Sit.

631
01:12:14,956 --> 01:12:18,540
Let's see what we can come up with.

632
01:12:20,253 --> 01:12:21,460
Yes!

633
01:12:23,923 --> 01:12:26,290
A beautiful Cupid's bow...

634
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:32,675
and a sensually full lower lip
is very evocative.

635
01:12:33,808 --> 01:12:37,802
The eyes are bloodshot and swollen.
Here, dab the eyes. Like that.

636
01:12:45,987 --> 01:12:47,694
Oh, my dear.

637
01:12:48,489 --> 01:12:52,824
We'll draw a few lines on your eyelids.

638
01:12:54,245 --> 01:12:56,077
There we are.

639
01:12:59,709 --> 01:13:02,952
A healthier skin color wouldn't hurt.

640
01:13:09,677 --> 01:13:14,513
What should we come up with now?
Yes, borrow my morning robe.

641
01:13:17,935 --> 01:13:20,518
There and there.

642
01:13:20,605 --> 01:13:22,392
There we are.

643
01:13:22,481 --> 01:13:25,064
There we are. It suits you, it suits you.

644
01:13:25,818 --> 01:13:27,559
Wait.

645
01:13:27,653 --> 01:13:30,236
Nice pajamas are needed
for occasions like this.

646
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:35,655
A lovely fragrance? No?

647
01:13:35,745 --> 01:13:38,237
You prefer to smell of yourself,
of course.

648
01:13:38,331 --> 01:13:42,120
Each to his own scent,
but a little puff of fragrance anyway.

649
01:13:42,209 --> 01:13:43,666
I knew it.

650
01:13:44,378 --> 01:13:46,335
Take a look in the mirror.

651
01:13:49,467 --> 01:13:51,174
Now you are yourself,

652
01:13:51,802 --> 01:13:53,759
and yet not yourself.

653
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:57,677
The ideal requirement for a tryst.

654
01:13:59,018 --> 01:14:01,260
Come now. This way.

655
01:14:25,169 --> 01:14:26,876
There is her door.

656
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:34,926
You see what you want to see.

657
01:16:00,264 --> 01:16:01,880
Veronica?

658
01:17:48,205 --> 01:17:50,288
No. No, no.

659
01:17:50,374 --> 01:17:52,866
Don't worry about them.
Don't worry about them.

660
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:54,417
- Let me be.
- Don't worry...

661
01:18:58,692 --> 01:19:00,354
I thank you...

662
01:19:02,738 --> 01:19:05,697
for finally crossing the line.

663
01:19:07,993 --> 01:19:10,110
The mirror has been shattered.

664
01:19:12,623 --> 01:19:14,740
But what do the shards reflect?

665
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:19,119
Can you tell me that?

666
01:20:10,848 --> 01:20:12,714
Yes, he fired three shots.

667
01:20:13,642 --> 01:20:15,975
One of them tore open
a wound on my arm.

668
01:20:16,061 --> 01:20:17,677
I still have a small scar.

669
01:20:19,148 --> 01:20:21,856
I fell over in sheer terror.

670
01:20:21,942 --> 01:20:24,104
I thought it best to lie still.

671
01:20:25,529 --> 01:20:28,647
I heard him pacing back and forth
then go behind the house.

672
01:20:29,742 --> 01:20:32,155
Then he started running towards the path.

673
01:20:33,037 --> 01:20:37,452
I got up, went inside,
washed off the blood and put on a bandage.

674
01:20:38,459 --> 01:20:41,167
I hid the pistol
and then sat down and waited.

675
01:20:43,213 --> 01:20:45,421
He was gone a few minutes

676
01:20:45,507 --> 01:20:47,590
and then he came running back.

677
01:20:49,261 --> 01:20:51,218
I hid for safety's sake.

678
01:20:52,056 --> 01:20:54,173
He looked completely insane.

679
01:20:54,933 --> 01:20:58,301
He walked around the cottage
talking to himself.

680
01:21:00,105 --> 01:21:02,848
Then he took out the diary
and began writing.

681
01:21:03,650 --> 01:21:05,562
He wrote for several hours.

682
01:21:07,613 --> 01:21:12,483
Late morning he packed his satchel
and headed off towards the woods.

683
01:21:14,036 --> 01:21:16,153
I thought it was best to follow him.

684
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:18,704
He might hurt himself.

685
01:21:45,818 --> 01:21:46,979
Johan.

686
01:22:04,044 --> 01:22:05,501
Don't you see me?

687
01:22:08,841 --> 01:22:10,207
Johan.

688
01:23:15,032 --> 01:23:17,991
- Where is he?
- I know where you can find him.

689
01:23:18,076 --> 01:23:19,317
Come.

690
01:23:21,747 --> 01:23:24,205
- Call to him.
- Johan!

691
01:25:53,023 --> 01:25:55,640
I've been wondering one thing.

692
01:25:56,652 --> 01:25:58,393
Are you in a hurry?

693
01:25:58,862 --> 01:26:01,024
I'd like to ask something.

694
01:26:02,032 --> 01:26:03,523
It's like this...

695
01:26:05,369 --> 01:26:09,488
Isn't it true that when a woman
has lived with a man for a long time...

696
01:26:10,874 --> 01:26:13,958
Isn't it true that she eventually
becomes like the man?

697
01:26:15,295 --> 01:26:17,252
I mean, she loves him,

698
01:26:17,839 --> 01:26:21,628
tries to think like him,
and see things like him.

699
01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:25,462
It's said that it can change a person.

700
01:26:28,517 --> 01:26:31,430
Is that why I began seeing those spirits?

701
01:26:33,105 --> 01:26:35,313
Or were they there regardless?

702
01:26:38,235 --> 01:26:42,229
I mean, had I loved him less,

703
01:26:42,322 --> 01:26:45,440
and not cared so much
about the things surrounding him...

704
01:26:46,743 --> 01:26:49,201
would I have been able
to protect him better?

705
01:26:52,833 --> 01:26:56,326
Or was it that I didn't love him enough...

706
01:26:57,337 --> 01:26:59,545
that made me jealous?

707
01:27:01,591 --> 01:27:06,461
Was it because of those "man eaters,"
as he called them...

708
01:27:08,014 --> 01:27:10,927
Was it because of them
it went so horribly bad for us?

709
01:27:18,859 --> 01:27:21,602
I thought I was so close to him.

710
01:27:24,781 --> 01:27:27,569
Sometimes he also said
that he was close to me.

711
01:27:30,036 --> 01:27:32,278
Once he said it with conviction.

712
01:27:36,418 --> 01:27:39,377
If only I could have followed him
all the time.

713
01:27:43,467 --> 01:27:45,959
There are so many things to ponder.

714
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:49,386
So many questions...

715
01:27:50,307 --> 01:27:53,596
Sometimes you don't know up from down,
and you get completely...
