1
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:36,230
Busan family church

2
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:34,120
Don't have a baby if you'll abandon it.

3
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,340
You follow that woman.

4
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,220
Anyone there?

5
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,220
Must've run off.

6
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,180
I guess so.

7
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,850
Give me a towel.

8
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,660
"Woo-sung, I'm sorry. I'll come back for you."

9
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,580
Here we go again with "I'll come back".

10
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,540
No phone number.

11
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,910
Woo-sung, I'm sorry.
I'll come back for you.

12
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,370
No way she comes back.

13
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,380
Erase the video, quick.

14
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,180
Look at those shiny eyes.

15
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:02,270
Not much for eyebrows, but still, he's so adorable.

16
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,820
How could anyone throw him away?

17
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,940
So you're Woo-sung?

18
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,030
That's right, Woo-sung.

19
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:16,280
Let's be happy with us.

20
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:19,870
Broker

21
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:43,390
Passengers taking an express bus can get off here.

22
00:07:54,020 --> 00:08:00,780
Use exit no. 3 for Busan Intercity Bus Terminal...

23
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:57,920
How's the knee? It was hurting before.

24
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:59,760
- It's fine now.
- It's okay?

25
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,550
It's much better.

26
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,640
Come out often. The exercise will help.

27
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,680
Whenever I get here, I need a rest.

28
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,770
How's the laundry business?

29
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,650
Well, just so-so.

30
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:33,620
Brother socrates...

31
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,530
Anyway,

32
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:08,660
it's pretty bold of them to use a baby box for human trafficking.

33
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,330
Creating that box in the first place

34
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:16,460
makes for more irresponsible mothers.

35
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,790
I think you have a hidden nice side.

36
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,010
What?

37
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:26,470
If you'd left it outside, it would've died.

38
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,850
I am nice.

39
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:33,180
Didn't you know?

40
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,150
Was it a boy or a girl?

41
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:45,400
- Hello!
- Good afternoon!

42
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:47,990
That was so delicious last time.

43
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,240
What was it called? Schu...

44
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,910
Schweinshaxe?

45
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,040
Schweinshaxe.

46
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,250
The day after eating it,

47
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:57,920
my skin was so shiny, I couldn't believe it.

48
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,040
Come on, it's just pig trotters.

49
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:02,550
Have you heard of choucroute by any chance?

50
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:06,630
I'm going to try making it, you're welcome to join us.

51
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,180
It's just pork stew. Pretty bland.

52
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,850
The whites are at the cleaner's, so I brought black ones.

53
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:13,640
Nice and thick.

54
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,560
Thanks.

55
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,730
Just in case, you know...

56
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:16,690
Thanks.

57
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:18,270
Bye, then.

58
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,150
Have a good day!

59
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,870
Shouldn't you at least step out of the car, as a courtesy?

60
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,120
No need.

61
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,870
He's at home all day anyway.
This gets him exercise.

62
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:38,170
He is the ideal type for marriage.

63
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,500
Really?

64
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,630
How so? You want him?

65
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,880
If you ever have a baby,

66
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,550
he'll be home writing so he can care for it.

67
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:50,590
The mother came back?

68
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,600
Something odd?

69
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,230
Yeah.

70
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:02,190
She says she left him outside. Outside the box.

71
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,200
Was she just confused in the moment?

72
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:17,120
If you think she'll call the cops, bring her here. Okay?

73
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,500
I will.

74
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:22,290
Yeah.

75
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:31,260
Nothing's written in our records.

76
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:34,890
Call the pastor.

77
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:37,470
And can you wash su-kyung for me?

78
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,100
Okay.

79
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,860
Dong-soo, you were on duty yesterday?

80
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,690
Yes, I always take sundays.

81
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:52,860
Please show the babies here to this woman.

82
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:00,160
This is the bigger kids' playroom.

83
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,870
There are 19 children living here.

84
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:06,000
All thrown away in the baby box.

85
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:16,100
This one came in last week.
The mom's 15 years old.

86
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,520
This one's mother is from Pakistan.

87
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,020
She was a baby sitter, I heard.

88
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,770
This is it?

89
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,530
For now.

90
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,450
Did you leave a note?

91
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,120
Something with the baby?

92
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:38,990
Yes.

93
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:42,960
Your name and number, were they in the note?

94
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:48,210
Then even if we find the baby,

95
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,960
there's no proof you're the mother.

96
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:53,260
What's going on?

97
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:57,260
She's looking for a baby. Named Woo-sung.

98
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:01,770
She said she left a baby outside the box last night.

99
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:05,980
If you'd left it inside, our worker would've gone out

100
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,690
and spoken with you.

101
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:11,150
Yes, that's what I told her.

102
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:54,150
Not at all.

103
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:57,490
Kidnapping?

104
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,120
How can you use that word?

105
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:02,120
Am I wrong?

106
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:04,540
You're the one who threw him away.

107
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,960
No, I left him there!

108
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,880
We're not some kind of pet hotel.

109
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:13,710
I said in the note I'd come back!

110
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:24,020
If a note says "I'll come back",
he's taken off the adoption list.

111
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:26,890
100% chance he goes to an orphanage.

112
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:29,230
You know what that means?

113
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,320
I'm sure you wrote that with loving intention,

114
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,450
but it closes off all future paths for him.

115
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,910
We want...

116
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:40,410
Uh, Woo-sung...

117
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:45,290
To be rescued from that kind of dark future.

118
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,830
Rather than grow up in an orphanage,

119
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:55,260
much better to be in the care of a loving family.

120
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:59,550
It's adoption.

121
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:02,010
We search for parents to raise him.

122
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:04,810
You people have no right.

123
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:06,810
Neither do you, after abandoning him.

124
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:08,100
This is theft!

125
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:09,060
Protection.

126
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:12,440
Of course, we don't have that right, but still...

127
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:17,490
Shall we describe it as... benevolence?

128
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,820
Benevolence...

129
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:24,160
Haven't heard that word in ages.

130
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:27,080
Parents who are unable to conceive a child,

131
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:31,500
and who can't wait for the lengthy adoption review process,

132
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:36,380
and a mother who for reasons she cannot say...

133
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:39,050
Your name is...?

134
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,640
Sun-ah... moon sun-ah.

135
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:48,980
Miss sun-ah, think of us as cupids
who will embrace your precious child.

136
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:53,940
We promise to find the best parents to raise Woo-sung.

137
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:57,320
Cupids?

138
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:00,150
Well, forgive the expression...

139
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:01,740
How about...

140
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,990
Mr. Stork? Or the stork twins, since there are two of us?

141
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:11,790
And it's case-by-case, but there is a modest payment.

142
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:14,540
Payment?

143
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,050
How much was it?

144
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,840
About 10 million won. For a male child.

145
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:22,550
Who gets the fee?

146
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:27,470
You, of course. And we who arrange the deal...

147
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,440
Benevolence, my ass.

148
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:37,940
You're just brokers.

149
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,780
You could call it that.

150
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,410
When do we go?

151
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,430
That must be the mother, right?

152
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:11,810
Not sure...

153
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:16,610
Doesn't look like it.

154
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,120
Hi, tae-ho.

155
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:30,830
What are you...?

156
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:33,960
Hello.

157
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,710
We're closed today.

158
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,380
Don't know if this will wash out...

159
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,630
This...

160
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:46,380
This is...

161
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:48,550
It's blood, obviously.

162
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:52,180
I'll give it a try.

163
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:56,270
And about the money, next week...

164
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:59,270
We're thinking of opening a fried chicken place, here.

165
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,780
If you can't pay, drop by the casino...

166
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:06,110
No, I'm never going back there.

167
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,490
Guess you've got options.

168
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:13,740
Then 50 million by next week.
And clean up that shirt.

169
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,250
Yes.

170
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,540
Good bye.

171
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,960
Hey, tae-ho.

172
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,920
Since when did you start working with gangsters?

173
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,010
You nagging me?

174
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:31,140
Mister, mind your own business.

175
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,970
Weren't you running a restaurant with your mom?

176
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,770
Wheat noodles make me want to puke, now.

177
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,250
What's with them?

178
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:03,800
Nothing. Came to complain.

179
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,130
Fix this, will you?

180
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,300
There's a trick to it.

181
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,640
Push on the left!

182
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,030
Do we need to take her?

183
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,780
With the mom there, it looks less suspicious.

184
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,700
Sun-ah! Time to go.

185
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,160
It's all about the money for her. But 5:5?

186
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:40,580
You said it. Should be thirds, at least.

187
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,550
It's 2.5 hours to Yeongdeok on the Gyeongbu expressway.

188
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:48,800
So we'll pass gyeongju rest area at lunchtime.

189
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,930
Let's stop there.

190
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,870
In a car like that,

191
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:24,920
they won't be driving too far, right?

192
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:28,670
Probably ulsan or pohang?

193
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,390
God, I want to take a shower and change my clothes.

194
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,680
Remember.

195
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:44,850
We need to arrest them in the act!

196
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:57,490
Sun-ah, your hometown is...?

197
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,500
I'm from Busan.

198
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:08,840
This guy claims Seoul as his hometown...

199
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,510
Claims?

200
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:14,050
Then what about you?

201
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:15,640
Yeosu.

202
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,760
Ah, yeosu.

203
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,020
All they have there is the gondola.

204
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,730
It's a cable car.

205
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:26,400
The raw sole there is delicious.
And the gatkimchi...

206
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:40,790
We went there ages ago to sell a baby.

207
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:43,500
To those gay guys?

208
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,790
Ah, you're right!

209
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,580
That was yeosu.

210
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:49,420
I remember.

211
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:53,090
Wonder how he's getting on.
Must be in primary school.

212
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:57,050
The night sea in yeosu...

213
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:03,100
Don't say anything dumb.

214
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:04,600
We'll do the negotiating.

215
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:09,060
Yes, after all, the customer comes first.

216
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:12,900
- Think of them as a client...
- They're here.

217
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,490
Mr. Im Chang-ho?

218
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:19,410
We're here from Busan...

219
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:21,200
- Show us the baby.
- Sure.

220
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,950
He just woke up.

221
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,040
Isn't he cute?

222
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:32,500
Did you use Photoshop, by any chance?

223
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:34,130
He was cuter in the photo.

224
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:36,300
It's because he just woke up.

225
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:39,800
But looking at him now, his eyebrows are so thin...

226
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:43,470
Because he's a baby.
Usually his eyes are like this.

227
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:46,680
He's so cute. Woo-sung, open your eyes!

228
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:48,480
We'll pay 4 million.

229
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,230
But yesterday you said 10 million won.

230
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:53,270
4 million is a lot for him.

231
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,360
Sure.

232
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,950
Or we'll pay in installments.
You can do that?

233
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:58,660
Over 12 months.

234
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:01,010
I've never heard of something like this.

235
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:03,740
We can't accept such sudden conditions.

236
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:05,910
Who is the father?

237
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,960
His dad?

238
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,750
His dad is...

239
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:14,500
Don't tell me it was rape or anything like that.

240
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:17,220
- If a crime is involved...
- How can you say that?

241
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:20,800
His mother is right here, she's so devoted.

242
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:23,640
Caring for her sick parents...

243
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,640
You son of a bitch!

244
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,270
Son of a bitch?

245
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:33,520
Don't you look in the mirror?
Going on about his eyebrows,

246
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:34,690
you stupid bitch.

247
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:37,360
- Are you crazy?
- What did you call me?

248
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,820
Sun-ah!

249
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:44,200
How can she be so rude?

250
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:45,700
Rude?

251
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:47,870
Sure, I'm fucking rude!

252
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,830
And are you respectful?

253
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:54,130
Talking shit about someone's baby, is that fucking respectful?

254
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:58,340
We drove all the way out to this hick town and what, 4 million?

255
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:01,340
Are you fucking kidding me?

256
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:05,050
I'll never give him to scumbags like you.

257
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:09,810
Just fuck off before I hit you, you beggars.

258
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,690
- Beggars?
- What?

259
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:23,740
How could...

260
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,620
She called us beggars.

261
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:47,600
Want some crab? They steam it for you.

262
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:52,520
That was a bit extreme.

263
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:54,600
Yes, it was.

264
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:56,650
My point exactly.

265
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:01,320
They were customers. We were negotiating.

266
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,820
Right, they're like customers.

267
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:06,950
If they weren't I would've slapped them.

268
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:11,830
This is how we reach a compromise.

269
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:16,580
Sure, that kind of attitude won't accomplish...

270
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:20,050
We can accomplish something by finding a better buyer!

271
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:23,550
She's got a point.

272
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:27,260
4 million, in installments? Gimme a break.

273
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:35,520
What should we do? Go back to Busan?

274
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:39,730
I guess so. Let's do that.

275
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:44,110
There are other buyers, right?

276
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:49,910
- Hello, sir.
- Hi.

277
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:52,250
So, is there blood?

278
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:53,410
A bit.

279
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,160
- Candy?
- Thank you, sir.

280
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:57,500
It's children's day tomorrow.

281
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,840
My grandma gave me some holiday cash.

282
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:06,800
Did you identify him?

283
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,640
We're in the process of contacting his family.

284
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:12,720
What's the cause of death?

285
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:15,350
A heavy blow broke his neck.

286
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:18,480
My, he's still young.

287
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:24,570
I hate blood so much.

288
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:29,120
The view here is killer.

289
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,040
It's a woman...

290
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:58,900
There must be more, right?

291
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:04,480
Surely they won't go back to Busan?

292
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:07,110
That won't do.

293
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:14,660
- Dong-soo!
- Hi.

294
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:17,000
Foul play!

295
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,920
That guy's the director. Third generation.

296
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,420
He looks third generation, right?

297
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,880
Dong-soo!

298
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,130
Dong-soo!

299
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:26,210
How've you been?

300
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,840
How are you?

301
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,280
Dong-soo, let me show you something.

302
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:32,090
- Dong-soo!
- It's Dong-soo!

303
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:34,560
Wow, Dong-soo!

304
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,680
It's really him!

305
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:49,200
So that's why he wanted to come here.

306
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,860
Why didn't you say you were coming?

307
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:55,490
Your numbers look down again.

308
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:59,210
Three kids gone in half a year.

309
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:03,040
4.5 million less per month. In subsidies.

310
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:05,550
You kids go play. Hurry up.

311
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:08,800
Losing team gets finger flicked, okay?

312
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:10,630
Go play!

313
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,640
Huh?

314
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:19,060
He found himself a new wife.

315
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:22,650
She's so young.

316
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:24,480
How'd they meet?

317
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,940
One of those dating apps?

318
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,240
Hey you!

319
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:32,990
You dummy, I told you not to go in there!

320
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,870
Don't you see those flowers?

321
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:38,080
- Dong-soo, let's play basketball!
- Okay.

322
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,580
Hurry up!

323
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:46,420
Sarge, last time you told the chief

324
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:50,720
the church was in on this child trafficking case...

325
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,760
And it's true.

326
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:55,050
The younger one is an employee there.

327
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,760
Part time.

328
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:58,970
He's an employee.

329
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,020
Even if it's a temp job.

330
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:04,810
Still, for supposedly professional brokers,

331
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:07,820
their actions seem pretty improvised...

332
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:13,820
You put lukewarm water in this. Didn't you?

333
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:18,740
It's because you didn't wait 3 minutes.

334
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:24,500
If you take money, you're a professional broker, no?

335
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:28,500
Technically, but...

336
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:33,970
Calling it a deep organization seems a bit overstated.

337
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:39,350
You hate when that criminal affairs guy
calls you "the kid", right?

338
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:43,020
Give it to me.

339
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:48,440
Give it.

340
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:49,860
Yoon-woo!

341
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:50,860
Yes?

342
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:53,240
Let ha-jun use that now.

343
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:56,030
Hae-Jin, that's enough soccer for now!

344
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:57,870
Five more minutes!

345
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,790
His skills aren't improving any.

346
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:09,500
You still have that scar.

347
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,340
You were bleeding so much then,

348
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:18,300
we called the ambulance and everything.

349
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:23,850
There was a kite in the tree,
so I climbed up but a branch broke...

350
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:29,190
The only one here who gets into so much trouble is Young-min.

351
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:31,360
Young-min?

352
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,570
Ah, Young-min...

353
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,280
He's on the run now.

354
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,990
Again?

355
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:42,370
Just like the old days.

356
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:56,720
Haven't heard anything.

357
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,880
Unfortunately.

358
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:04,600
These days, that's not the main reason I come.

359
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:16,360
Well, you can think of it as a blind date.

360
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:17,900
Toe!

361
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:20,660
Then I'll send you a photo.

362
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:26,910
His eyebrows are a bit lacking.

363
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:33,130
Let me borrow this a sec.

364
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:39,430
That'll look ridiculous!

365
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:44,220
Don't you think he looks more manly?

366
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:47,270
But why am I your wife?

367
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:52,440
Dong-soo knows everyone here.

368
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,190
Then say I'm your daughter.

369
00:32:57,690 --> 00:32:59,400
We don't look anything alike.

370
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:01,820
Hey kid, don't touch.

371
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:03,660
With your dirty hands.

372
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,530
I said, don't touch!

373
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:07,660
It's just until we find a buyer.

374
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,460
Why so sensitive?

375
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:11,210
Don't touch!

376
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,460
Your hands are dirty!

377
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:15,710
His eyebrows look weird.

378
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:25,220
Can I be your son?

379
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:26,890
Why?

380
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:29,100
I want to play soccer.

381
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,350
Soccer?

382
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:33,850
And make tons of money like son heung-min.

383
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:37,150
It hasn't been long since Woo-sung was born.

384
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:40,860
Too soon for a second, right?

385
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,860
Right. One's more than enough.

386
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:47,280
I think it's a reasonable offer.

387
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:53,830
One kid from here became a pro soccer player.

388
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,920
Which team was it?

389
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,250
They have striped uniforms.

390
00:33:58,460 --> 00:33:59,880
I don't know.

391
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:05,140
They say that kids from an orphanage can succeed,

392
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:06,890
but 97%...

393
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:08,720
Pretending to be smart again...

394
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:12,060
- 3% is high!
- That punk...

395
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,020
Just the word 'orphanage' gets him all worked up.

396
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,900
What percentage of people succeed anyway?

397
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,070
Who's that?

398
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:26,320
Someone ran away. I guess they caught him.

399
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:30,120
Dong-soo, I broke your record!

400
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:34,330
It took 3 days before I was caught.

401
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,540
Are you bragging?

402
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:40,130
If you consider time as well as distance...

403
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:43,420
Good for you, jeez...

404
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,260
Hello?

405
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:48,090
Yes, I understand.

406
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,720
You're in uljin, right?

407
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:51,600
No, it's fine.

408
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:55,230
- See you tomorrow.
- What happened to your eyebrows?

409
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:59,610
Here's the seafood stew.

410
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:09,450
- A coin laundromat...
- This is si-woo.

411
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:11,540
I played forward, and he was midfielder.

412
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:13,370
Will never sew a button for you.

413
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:17,880
Back then we had enough kids for two soccer teams!

414
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:25,050
They won't shorten pants, or repair a hole in the knee.

415
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:30,140
You know that law? About adoption.

416
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:32,510
The special adoption act.

417
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:36,020
I was hoping it'd be stricter about foreign adoptions.

418
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:39,480
But don't all the kids want to be adopted?

419
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,360
Idunno...

420
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:45,400
That kid who likes soccer was really persistent.

421
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:46,490
Hae-Jin...

422
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:51,450
It's too late for him. He's 7 already.

423
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:53,040
He's 8.

424
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,250
Ah, that's too late.

425
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:56,660
It's late.

426
00:35:56,710 --> 00:36:03,550
You've got to figure people adopt up to age 6.

427
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:06,220
He must know it, too.

428
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,890
Some kids don't like it and come back.

429
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:18,230
That adoptee a while back, who got abused.

430
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:22,310
Blood is thicker than water.

431
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,820
And what if a new child is conceived after they adopt?

432
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:34,580
Right, the kids here have all been rejected,

433
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,450
when they were abandoned.

434
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:38,620
But if it happens again...

435
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:42,960
I've had nothing but rejection in my life.

436
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:47,920
At least get rid of the whistle.
This isn't the military.

437
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:52,140
Hey, as for me,

438
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:56,560
I want to be a kind of father figure to them.

439
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,640
You know?

440
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:01,810
That's why I do this.

441
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:11,280
Damn... hide, quickly!

442
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:29,920
Sleep, my baby.

443
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:37,430
In the front yard, and in the hill in back,

444
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:43,980
the birds and the baby lambs

445
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:50,440
are all sleeping.

446
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:13,220
She sang a song.

447
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:14,890
What song?

448
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,470
A lullaby.

449
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:19,810
A lullaby?

450
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:28,270
This place has everything, it's great.

451
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:31,190
Let's take it all with us!

452
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,240
Do his ears, like this.

453
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,950
You sure talk a lot.

454
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:41,500
If we keep looking, we may find a better buyer.

455
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,960
Let's just go with the uljin people.

456
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,210
Okay, all done...

457
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,500
Now you're all clean.

458
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:53,090
Your mommy wants to say bye-bye so quickly.

459
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:55,970
We're trying our hardest...

460
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:58,800
Know how hard it is raising a baby alone?

461
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:02,520
Still, that doesn't justify throwing him away.

462
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,390
Then how do you justify selling him?

463
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,060
Someone threw him away, so we sell him.

464
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:09,020
Get the order right.

465
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:12,530
Then you shouldn't have made that box in the first place.

466
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:14,530
My thoughts exactly!

467
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:16,820
They say they're trying to save babies,

468
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:19,160
but instead they just corrupt mothers.

469
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,320
It's not like that.

470
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:23,750
Thanks to that box, Woo-sung is alive and well...

471
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,330
Don't use alcohol wipes on his face.
He's crying!

472
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,090
Oh, sorry...

473
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:33,630
Among all the mothers who leave notes,

474
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:35,720
how many do you think really come back?

475
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,550
How would I know?

476
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:40,090
1 out of 40.

477
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:42,850
The other 39 are never heard from again.

478
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:46,600
Why just blame the mothers?
Say that to the fathers, too!

479
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:49,020
Then at least leave your phone number in the note!

480
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:51,650
It's already the second time I'm hearing this.

481
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:54,030
Should I say it again?

482
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,610
I can say it all day.

483
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:57,650
Who are you to act so superior?

484
00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:01,490
The kids in this dirty orphanage look up to you,
so you're conceited?

485
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:03,620
Just live here, then.

486
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:15,510
You cold?

487
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:20,760
Dong-soo thought his mom would be 1 out of 40.

488
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:23,260
Look out by the playground.

489
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:28,020
See that old gate?
That's where he was abandoned.

490
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:31,150
With a note that said "I'll come back for you."

491
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:34,780
That's why he's so touchy, try to understand.

492
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:46,950
I saw jee-young working here.

493
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:49,290
She came back.

494
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:52,330
Not easy to be a singer.

495
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,760
Still, I liked her voice.

496
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:00,760
3to1.

497
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:11,850
But everyone ends up finding a place here.

498
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:17,820
Must be fun.

499
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:20,780
4to1.

500
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,780
Fun?

501
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:32,080
More fun than living alone.

502
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:42,720
Still, you should go far, far away.

503
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:47,890
Far away where?

504
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:50,560
Far.

505
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:55,520
You're our hope, our star.

506
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,780
Where do you want me to go?

507
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,450
Anywhere.

508
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:08,240
If even you end up back here, it'll be kind of sad.

509
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:26,530
Good morning.

510
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:40,630
Woo-sung, this is rain!

511
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:42,710
Rain.

512
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:45,470
It's just raindrops.

513
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:48,640
Same thing.

514
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:03,610
Sorry about yesterday.

515
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:06,990
I shouldn't have said that.

516
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:10,740
What was it you said?

517
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:18,750
I have this dream sometimes.

518
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:23,340
It's raining...

519
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:29,510
The rain washes away everything I was up to yesterday.

520
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:36,680
But when I open my eyes,

521
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:41,440
the rain is still pouring down,

522
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,860
and nothing about me has changed.

523
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:51,530
Don't you just need an umbrella?

524
00:44:53,330 --> 00:44:54,910
Umbrella?

525
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:59,960
Yeah, a big one.

526
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,250
Big enough for two people.

527
00:45:16,310 --> 00:45:20,690
Then I want a red one.
With a strawberry pattern.

528
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:25,730
When I was little, my friend had one of those.

529
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:28,150
I was so envious.

530
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:32,200
You stole it?

531
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:34,120
Yeah.

532
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,280
I threw it away.

533
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:19,240
So they're not related by blood?

534
00:46:19,330 --> 00:46:21,710
No. They all call her mom, but...

535
00:46:21,790 --> 00:46:23,250
All?

536
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:25,080
You woke me up,

537
00:46:25,170 --> 00:46:28,130
startled the old man so he can't sleep.

538
00:46:28,210 --> 00:46:29,460
What's going on?

539
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:31,720
The police car came in, what's happening?

540
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,550
Shence!

541
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:35,890
Come back here.

542
00:46:35,970 --> 00:46:37,720
Just hold on.

543
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:44,190
I've never seen that man.

544
00:46:44,310 --> 00:46:46,230
What's this about?

545
00:46:46,650 --> 00:46:49,940
He was murdered, in a hotel. Then...

546
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,360
Look closely.

547
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:56,410
This was taken by the hotel cctv.

548
00:46:56,490 --> 00:46:58,740
That woman lives here?

549
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:03,000
Ye-ji, take the kids over there.

550
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:07,080
In front of the kids, really...

551
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:09,250
You, the taller one.

552
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:11,340
The taller one, just a sec.

553
00:47:13,210 --> 00:47:14,720
Candy?

554
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:20,640
You can speak freely with me.

555
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:23,980
This woman lives here, right?

556
00:47:26,690 --> 00:47:28,440
I don't know.

557
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:37,610
Ma'am.

558
00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:41,660
This is a baby she's carrying, right?

559
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:46,870
I told her not to give birth.
How could she be a mother?

560
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,630
What did you say?

561
00:47:48,830 --> 00:47:52,170
I said I told her not to have it!

562
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:55,420
How could she be a mother?

563
00:47:57,430 --> 00:47:59,390
Shence!

564
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:04,680
Taking kids in and making them do these things...

565
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:07,060
Is that a mother?

566
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:14,400
I just look after girls who've got nowhere to go.

567
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:17,450
Murder?

568
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:22,580
She's a prostitute?

569
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,750
So you're saying,

570
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:32,000
the baby was keeping her from running away.

571
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:40,180
Give me 3 days. I'll make sure they sell him.

572
00:48:49,270 --> 00:48:51,100
Wow...

573
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:55,110
If it's murder, criminal affairs will be on it.

574
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:57,240
They already are.

575
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,110
We'd better set it up.

576
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,740
Set it up?

577
00:49:03,530 --> 00:49:05,160
A buyer.

578
00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:24,390
Dammit. Buyer's not answering.

579
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:28,930
It's because you sent that photo with the eyebrows.

580
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:32,900
How about this one? 20 million.

581
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:35,860
Twice the market price...

582
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:37,650
Should we meet them?

583
00:49:37,730 --> 00:49:39,150
Huh? Who?

584
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,530
They own a building, it seems.

585
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,200
How old is the woman?

586
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:48,910
Why, you want someone younger?

587
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:52,290
No, it's not that.

588
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:57,210
I've got a bad feeling.

589
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:03,890
Don't you think it's cheap, though?

590
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:07,640
10 million won?

591
00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:12,060
The going price for a baby.

592
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:15,360
And for girls it's only 8 million.

593
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,270
- Sarge...
- Yeah?

594
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:24,530
- Isn't it illegal to bait people?
- Why 2 million cheaper? So annoying.

595
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:28,990
What did you ask?

596
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:33,620
I was taught such evidence can't be used in court.

597
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:38,840
The criminal intention was there from the start.

598
00:50:39,590 --> 00:50:41,590
It's not baiting.

599
00:50:43,590 --> 00:50:45,590
It's providing an opportunity.

600
00:50:45,970 --> 00:50:47,470
An opportunity...

601
00:50:49,390 --> 00:50:52,350
Brother socrates...

602
00:50:52,430 --> 00:50:54,480
Hey, once we close that deal,

603
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:57,150
back in Busan, that place...

604
00:50:57,230 --> 00:50:59,570
Want to go there?

605
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:01,900
You want to see Jennifer again?

606
00:51:02,070 --> 00:51:04,400
Go yourself. I'm not into that kind of thing.

607
00:51:04,490 --> 00:51:06,240
Keep your voice down.

608
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:10,580
Such a nice topic for a situation like this.

609
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:13,710
Just trying to lighten the mood.

610
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:16,790
During military service, before going out on a drill...

611
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,540
You never went to the military.
You were in jail.

612
00:51:19,630 --> 00:51:20,750
Neither did you.

613
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:23,050
With the exemption for orphanage kids.

614
00:51:23,130 --> 00:51:25,930
It's the same exemption gold medalists get.

615
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:30,890
What is it with love...?

616
00:51:42,030 --> 00:51:43,740
What's wrong?

617
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:50,370
Why pull over here?

618
00:51:51,990 --> 00:51:54,000
I'm gonna pee my pants!

619
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:56,710
I almost peed.

620
00:51:57,290 --> 00:51:59,170
That punk.

621
00:52:10,430 --> 00:52:14,310
I told you I had a bad feeling.

622
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:17,560
The bad feeling was about this?

623
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:30,740
The car kept shaking, I almost peed my pants.

624
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:36,700
This car is junk.

625
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:42,210
You're the one who climbed into it.

626
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:45,840
Mister, can you take me with you?

627
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:49,470
Everyone will worry.

628
00:52:49,550 --> 00:52:52,220
We'll give you money to ride a bus home.

629
00:52:57,560 --> 00:53:00,560
Why are you interrupting our family trip?

630
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:03,230
I know everything. You're not a family.

631
00:53:03,310 --> 00:53:05,690
You're going to sell Woo-sung.

632
00:53:06,570 --> 00:53:09,070
- How much did you hear?
- All of it.

633
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:18,120
I'll attach the mic here.

634
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:24,170
Don't be negative and say his hair's too thin, and so on.

635
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:27,300
And don't ask the birth mother about the father.

636
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:29,300
Seems there was some issue.

637
00:53:30,130 --> 00:53:32,510
- Have some coffee.
- Thank you very much.

638
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:34,180
Thank you.

639
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:38,470
Do they look like they own a building?

640
00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:42,350
Are they too young?

641
00:53:42,810 --> 00:53:44,520
I'm sorry.

642
00:53:45,190 --> 00:53:47,940
No, no need to apologize.

643
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:53,610
You two are in a de facto marriage,
with no marriage certificate.

644
00:53:54,990 --> 00:53:58,040
- So you can't adopt officially.
- Yes.

645
00:54:01,410 --> 00:54:03,920
Let's say your sperm count is low.

646
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:06,170
Me?

647
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:10,300
And hand over the money quickly. Be natural.

648
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:12,470
I understand. Low sperm count, act natural.

649
00:54:12,550 --> 00:54:15,140
Low sperm, give money quickly...

650
00:54:15,930 --> 00:54:19,680
So let's practice your dialogue.

651
00:54:19,770 --> 00:54:21,680
Very well.

652
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:25,770
And this is the money we prepared.

653
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:31,940
We've done fertility treatments for 5 years now,

654
00:54:32,030 --> 00:54:34,740
and both of us are so tired.

655
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:36,620
Sergeant,

656
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:39,240
should we mention the de facto marriage here?

657
00:54:39,330 --> 00:54:42,410
That it's hard for us to adopt officially and all...

658
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:44,420
Good! Let's do that.

659
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:46,000
Thank you.

660
00:54:48,170 --> 00:54:52,220
We'll truly treasure this baby like our own child.

661
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:57,010
Shall we take out that 'truly'?

662
00:54:57,100 --> 00:55:00,520
Ah, shall we? Okay, no 'truly'...

663
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:03,060
We'll treasure truly this baby... no.

664
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:05,560
We'll treasure our own babies...

665
00:55:06,190 --> 00:55:07,860
- What was it?
- We'll treasure...

666
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:10,900
We'll treasure our baby...

667
00:55:11,190 --> 00:55:16,820
We'll treasure this baby like our own child.

668
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:34,380
Can we name this car "the Hae-Jin express?"

669
00:55:34,970 --> 00:55:36,680
Whatever you want.

670
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,180
All right!

671
00:55:38,590 --> 00:55:40,390
Was it Jennifer?

672
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:42,310
Who's Jennifer?

673
00:55:42,850 --> 00:55:45,020
Dong-soo's girlfriend.

674
00:55:47,230 --> 00:55:49,230
Hey, what's written on the ball?

675
00:55:49,310 --> 00:55:51,940
Hae-Jin, my name.

676
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:53,990
The pastor named me.

677
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:58,280
I guess you like your name.

678
00:55:58,490 --> 00:55:59,820
It's not that.

679
00:55:59,910 --> 00:56:02,620
At the orphanage you need your name on things.

680
00:56:02,950 --> 00:56:06,660
If someone wants to steal it, a name won't stop them.
Right?

681
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:09,130
Plate #9388, pull over!

682
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:13,550
Plate #9388, pull over!

683
00:56:13,630 --> 00:56:16,470
What? I wasn't speeding.

684
00:56:16,630 --> 00:56:18,300
Dammit.

685
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:27,230
You're my wife...

686
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:31,150
Then you're a married couple working at my shop.

687
00:56:31,230 --> 00:56:33,190
Married? No way.

688
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:34,360
No way.

689
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:35,880
Then you're relatives.
Distant relatives, okay?

690
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:38,030
How distant? First cousin? Second?

691
00:56:38,110 --> 00:56:39,780
Good afternoon, sir.

692
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:41,120
Your license?

693
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:42,490
Yes, sir.

694
00:56:42,910 --> 00:56:45,790
I wasn't driving very fast...

695
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:48,500
Mr. Ha Jin-young?

696
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:50,250
Your rear door is open.

697
00:56:50,330 --> 00:56:53,210
If things fall out the back, it could cause a big accident.

698
00:56:53,290 --> 00:56:55,420
Oh, I'm sorry.

699
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:01,970
You on a trip somewhere?

700
00:57:02,090 --> 00:57:04,970
Yes, to lotte world to ride the Ferris wheel!

701
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:06,850
Wow, you're going far!

702
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:08,430
Yes, it's a family trip.

703
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:10,440
But there's no Ferris wheel there.

704
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:11,940
Really?

705
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:15,860
For a Ferris wheel, you should go to wolmido.

706
00:57:16,070 --> 00:57:18,280
Should we go to wolmido, then?

707
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:21,860
Ask your dad to take you on a boat cruise too.

708
00:57:21,950 --> 00:57:22,740
Yeah!

709
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:24,660
I can't deal with boats.

710
00:57:24,910 --> 00:57:26,790
I get seasick.

711
00:57:26,990 --> 00:57:28,750
- You run a laundry shop?
- Yes.

712
00:57:28,830 --> 00:57:31,120
I brought my shirt to be cleaned,

713
00:57:31,210 --> 00:57:33,710
but the sleeves all shrunk, why is that?

714
00:57:34,210 --> 00:57:37,130
This should be dry cleaned.
They threw it in the wash.

715
00:57:37,210 --> 00:57:37,840
Really?

716
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:40,590
Too many amateurs in laundry shops these days...

717
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:42,190
- Boss?
- You need to take care with...

718
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:43,390
Boss!

719
00:57:43,470 --> 00:57:45,470
- Boss!
- I think we need to go...

720
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:46,680
Well, then...

721
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:47,560
Your license.

722
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:48,520
Thank you.

723
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:50,140
Next time, dry clean!

724
00:57:50,230 --> 00:57:52,770
- All right. Have a good day.
- Yes.

725
00:57:54,650 --> 00:57:56,860
- Wolmido!
- Yes, sir...

726
00:58:09,370 --> 00:58:12,040
- Good afternoon.
- Sorry we 're late.

727
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:13,120
Were you waiting long?

728
00:58:13,210 --> 00:58:15,920
Not at all. We just arrived...

729
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,840
I'm Ha Sang-hyun.
You're Mr. Song Ji-cheol?

730
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,050
Yes, that's right.

731
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:21,420
- And he is Woo-sung?
- Yes.

732
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:24,430
- Are you his mother?
- Yes.

733
00:58:24,510 --> 00:58:27,220
Can I hold him?

734
00:58:28,470 --> 00:58:30,220
Yes, go ahead.

735
00:58:30,730 --> 00:58:32,640
Oh my.

736
00:58:33,690 --> 00:58:35,810
He touched me! Honey...

737
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:39,230
With prominent facial features like his...

738
00:58:41,990 --> 00:58:44,450
You'll raise him properly, right?

739
00:58:44,530 --> 00:58:47,490
Of course. We'll treasure him, truly.

740
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:51,540
If you have your own child later, you'll love them the same?

741
00:58:51,790 --> 00:58:52,830
Of course.

742
00:58:53,290 --> 00:58:56,790
Quit talking and give them the cash!

743
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,290
Money money!

744
00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:00,670
Will you keep doing fertility treatments?

745
00:59:01,590 --> 00:59:05,090
We've tried for 5 years already. Both of us...

746
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:07,550
- Both of us are tired.
- Yes.

747
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:10,890
And since we aren't officially married...

748
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:13,850
Did you do an AMH test?

749
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:16,850
Or an HSG?

750
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:20,570
Yes... that one.

751
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:23,690
I guess Letrozole had no effect?

752
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:27,070
None... and I had bad side effects with the Letrozole.

753
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:31,040
It was so hard for me to see him that way.

754
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:34,540
Letrozole induces ovulation,

755
00:59:35,410 --> 00:59:38,250
so of course, it won't have any effect on you.

756
00:59:39,290 --> 00:59:41,840
I mean, my sperm count...

757
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,470
We 're talking about ovulation, what does sperm count matter?

758
00:59:44,550 --> 00:59:46,760
Take this!

759
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:05,190
They wanted to resell him.

760
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:06,700
I could tell right away.

761
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:08,160
Reselling, you know?

762
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:10,120
Hae-Jin, don't open that window.

763
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:12,330
Someone paid them to act as parents.

764
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:16,290
How do you know so much about fertility treatments?

765
01:00:16,910 --> 01:00:20,630
A similar thing happened last year.
Sang-hyun totally fell for it.

766
01:00:20,710 --> 01:00:21,790
Hands off!

767
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:23,460
You have to observe closely, observe...

768
01:00:23,550 --> 01:00:27,130
If we'd given them Woo-sung, he'd be in a foreign...

769
01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:27,760
Hey!

770
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:28,880
Shut it! Shut it!

771
01:00:28,970 --> 01:00:30,720
Shut the window!

772
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:38,600
Hurry!

773
01:01:05,630 --> 01:01:07,300
We'll catch a cold.

774
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:10,260
Grab clothes in the back to change into.

775
01:01:18,770 --> 01:01:20,730
So, your driver's license...

776
01:01:20,850 --> 01:01:22,060
Huh?

777
01:01:22,150 --> 01:01:24,020
It says ha Jin-young.

778
01:01:24,650 --> 01:01:27,820
Sang-hyun was my nickname in the military.

779
01:01:28,110 --> 01:01:31,570
You never went to the military!

780
01:01:31,660 --> 01:01:33,370
Don't be a smart ass.

781
01:01:33,570 --> 01:01:38,620
What about you? "Oh, I get seasick..."

782
01:01:38,750 --> 01:01:40,000
Wasn't that totally realistic?

783
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:43,330
Realistic? That was totally stupid.

784
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:44,750
Hae-Jin was way better.

785
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:46,840
Woo-hoo!

786
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:50,300
Actually the name Sang-hyun

787
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:54,180
is what I wanted to name my son if I had one.

788
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:55,930
Really?

789
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:58,060
Really.

790
01:02:00,810 --> 01:02:03,100
I won't laugh, then.

791
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:11,030
It's so-young...

792
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:15,950
My real name. Moon so-young.

793
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:17,240
Who's sun-ah?

794
01:02:17,330 --> 01:02:20,750
This obnoxious lady who lives next door.

795
01:02:22,250 --> 01:02:25,290
This car is filled with liars.

796
01:02:58,580 --> 01:03:00,950
Since it's turned out this way,

797
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:04,080
should we use it?

798
01:03:04,540 --> 01:03:06,040
The murder charge?

799
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:42,490
Hello?

800
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:46,870
Who is this?

801
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:51,210
Hand over the baby.

802
01:03:52,090 --> 01:03:56,130
I paid your so-called mom before.

803
01:03:56,430 --> 01:03:58,220
5 million won.

804
01:04:00,260 --> 01:04:03,180
In return you were supposed to abort it,

805
01:04:03,770 --> 01:04:06,140
but then you had to go have the baby...

806
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:20,950
Ms. Moon so-young?

807
01:04:21,410 --> 01:04:23,160
We're from the police.

808
01:04:23,370 --> 01:04:25,410
Can we talk for a moment?

809
01:05:04,870 --> 01:05:06,080
You're back?

810
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:07,500
You're back?

811
01:05:07,580 --> 01:05:08,830
Took you a while.

812
01:05:08,910 --> 01:05:11,420
We're drafting a three-person work schedule.

813
01:05:11,580 --> 01:05:12,630
Work schedule?

814
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:15,090
For feeding Woo-sung.

815
01:05:16,510 --> 01:05:18,510
Did you hear good news or something?

816
01:05:18,630 --> 01:05:19,630
Yeah.

817
01:05:20,010 --> 01:05:24,180
There's a buyer in Seoul who will pay 30 million.

818
01:05:26,140 --> 01:05:28,980
Wow, bonanza...

819
01:05:30,310 --> 01:05:32,810
You're giving him a bath?

820
01:05:33,110 --> 01:05:36,440
He got poop smeared on his bum.

821
01:05:36,820 --> 01:05:39,450
Sang-hyun is so bad at this.

822
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:45,620
How about 2-hour shifts from 10pm. to 6am.?

823
01:05:46,700 --> 01:05:49,370
Sang, dong, so, dong, sang...

824
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:53,170
This lets you sleep for 6 hours straight!

825
01:05:53,290 --> 01:05:56,590
Not so much... can't we do this?

826
01:05:56,750 --> 01:05:59,090
- This is pretty unfair.
- Really?

827
01:05:59,170 --> 01:06:00,550
- I'll do it!
- What?

828
01:06:00,630 --> 01:06:02,090
Feed Woo-sung.

829
01:06:02,340 --> 01:06:04,890
- From 4am. to 6am.?
- Sure.

830
01:06:06,220 --> 01:06:09,520
Or how about 10pm. to midnight?

831
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:11,850
Don't give him your shift!

832
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:17,400
She agreed easily, right?

833
01:06:18,820 --> 01:06:20,400
She did.

834
01:06:22,030 --> 01:06:24,820
The reduced sentence must've convinced her...

835
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:28,040
I don't think it's that.

836
01:06:28,830 --> 01:06:30,500
Then what?

837
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,830
I don't know either.

838
01:06:34,540 --> 01:06:37,540
I'm not sure, but...

839
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:41,420
It wasn't the reduced sentence.

840
01:06:53,690 --> 01:06:55,190
How is he?

841
01:06:55,310 --> 01:06:56,730
Did he eat?

842
01:06:56,810 --> 01:06:58,900
No, he threw up again.

843
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:04,990
Did you let it cool properly?
It's not too hot?

844
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:08,490
It's fine.

845
01:07:08,620 --> 01:07:11,540
Was it because he got wet in the car?

846
01:07:11,910 --> 01:07:13,460
I'm sorry, Woo-sung.

847
01:07:13,540 --> 01:07:15,540
No, it's not because of you.

848
01:07:16,170 --> 01:07:18,790
Doesn't seem like an ordinary cold.

849
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:22,170
Has this happened before?

850
01:07:24,630 --> 01:07:26,260
We should go to the hospital.

851
01:07:28,220 --> 01:07:29,930
We can't do that.

852
01:07:30,430 --> 01:07:32,350
We could get caught.

853
01:07:46,780 --> 01:07:49,990
It's not cerebromeningitis, is it?

854
01:07:50,450 --> 01:07:53,000
The fever came on yesterday...

855
01:07:54,660 --> 01:07:56,670
Will he get better?

856
01:07:57,620 --> 01:07:59,630
He won't die, will he?

857
01:08:02,590 --> 01:08:04,460
Is he your brother?

858
01:08:06,470 --> 01:08:07,760
Yes.

859
01:08:08,260 --> 01:08:10,470
It's okay. He won't die.

860
01:08:12,470 --> 01:08:14,060
It looks like a cold,

861
01:08:14,310 --> 01:08:17,480
but watch him to be sure it doesn't turn into pneumonia.

862
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:22,650
I'll prescribe a fever reducer, but if it doesn't go down,

863
01:08:22,730 --> 01:08:24,610
come back tomorrow.

864
01:08:26,030 --> 01:08:28,450
What a relief, Woo-sung.

865
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:37,620
If affection is even sadder than love...

866
01:08:37,710 --> 01:08:39,750
Will the baby be okay?

867
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:44,000
They're all overreacting.

868
01:08:44,460 --> 01:08:47,260
It's just a cold.

869
01:08:47,470 --> 01:08:49,470
Yes, but still...

870
01:08:50,550 --> 01:08:53,640
If he doesn't get better soon, it's a real problem.

871
01:08:55,930 --> 01:08:57,850
Because they can't sell him?

872
01:09:02,770 --> 01:09:07,030
If they can't sell him, we can't arrest them in the act.

873
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:10,530
We're the female youth division,

874
01:09:10,610 --> 01:09:15,040
we should throw our net further up
the river than criminal affairs.

875
01:09:17,290 --> 01:09:19,120
Up the river?

876
01:09:19,540 --> 01:09:22,710
Shouldn't we have saved her before she threw away her child?

877
01:09:22,790 --> 01:09:25,130
That's for welfare services.

878
01:09:25,210 --> 01:09:28,920
Welfare before she abandons him, the police after.

879
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:31,720
Really...

880
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:36,810
Why are you so cold towards that woman?

881
01:09:43,150 --> 01:09:45,060
She's irresponsible.

882
01:09:47,150 --> 01:09:49,990
Have the baby, then abandon him on a whim...

883
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:55,490
Still, to judge her so quickly...

884
01:09:57,910 --> 01:10:01,500
Can you understand a woman who throws away her baby?

885
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:05,840
I can't.

886
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:16,350
You can't do that here.

887
01:10:16,430 --> 01:10:17,930
This isn't a playground.

888
01:10:18,020 --> 01:10:19,930
You're right.

889
01:10:20,890 --> 01:10:23,230
- You're his father?
- Yes.

890
01:10:24,690 --> 01:10:26,360
There are other patients here.

891
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:27,860
- Please control him.
- I will.

892
01:10:27,940 --> 01:10:29,940
Are you Woo-sung's father?

893
01:10:30,110 --> 01:10:33,320
Yes... sure...

894
01:10:33,660 --> 01:10:36,320
What's his national ID number?

895
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:40,950
Actually, he's still just a month old, so...

896
01:10:41,660 --> 01:10:42,830
One month?

897
01:10:42,910 --> 01:10:45,210
Yes, no one can believe it.

898
01:10:46,420 --> 01:10:48,380
Is it the formula?

899
01:10:48,460 --> 01:10:50,130
The American brand. What's it called?

900
01:10:50,210 --> 01:10:51,720
Similac.

901
01:10:52,220 --> 01:10:57,010
The boy's grandma gave us so much of that Similac...

902
01:10:57,100 --> 01:10:58,430
Right,

903
01:10:58,510 --> 01:11:01,480
she was so happy to have her first grandson.

904
01:11:01,890 --> 01:11:04,440
Then can you come with me for a moment?

905
01:11:04,770 --> 01:11:06,190
Sure.

906
01:11:08,860 --> 01:11:12,280
That punk, playing soccer all daylong.

907
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:16,700
That's why the director blows his whistle so much.

908
01:11:18,370 --> 01:11:20,120
Going on and on...

909
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:26,750
Thank you for doing this.

910
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:31,590
All kids get fevers, it's normal.

911
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:35,880
If I were alone, I'd have been helpless.

912
01:11:36,340 --> 01:11:40,060
No need to do it all yourself.

913
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:49,060
And the father...

914
01:11:49,900 --> 01:11:52,440
He was against it from the start.

915
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:57,030
I see. That's too bad...

916
01:12:26,230 --> 01:12:29,730
It seems this woman ran away with a baby.

917
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:32,360
Find her and bring it back.

918
01:12:33,570 --> 01:12:35,230
Bring her back?

919
01:12:35,570 --> 01:12:37,240
The baby.

920
01:12:38,910 --> 01:12:41,200
What will you do with it?

921
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:46,750
Raise it.

922
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:48,710
Myself.

923
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:51,460
Since it's my husband's.

924
01:13:01,010 --> 01:13:02,600
Fully automated?

925
01:13:03,220 --> 01:13:04,930
Are they kidding?

926
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:07,680
What do I do with this?

927
01:13:15,650 --> 01:13:17,400
Dammit.

928
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:21,780
Hi, tae-ho.

929
01:13:21,990 --> 01:13:25,580
I'm sorry, I'll get you the money soon.

930
01:13:29,710 --> 01:13:31,120
What?

931
01:13:31,290 --> 01:13:33,590
The baby? Who?

932
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:39,800
Woo-sung's father?

933
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:42,470
For how much?

934
01:13:44,140 --> 01:13:45,680
40 million?

935
01:13:50,730 --> 01:13:52,810
He's passed out cold.

936
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:56,400
Must've been tired.

937
01:13:56,610 --> 01:13:59,570
All day he was worrying it was his fault.

938
01:14:02,910 --> 01:14:05,030
He's like si-woo, this kid.

939
01:14:06,950 --> 01:14:10,040
The type that gets left behind.

940
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:15,290
Did you ever want to be adopted?

941
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:20,130
I liked it there.

942
01:14:20,550 --> 01:14:23,010
I told them I didn't want to be adopted.

943
01:14:24,550 --> 01:14:27,010
You thought your mom would come back?

944
01:14:30,350 --> 01:14:32,560
So Sang-hyun's been talking.

945
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:36,310
Yeah, about the letter.

946
01:14:39,690 --> 01:14:42,950
I never thought of myself as abandoned.

947
01:14:49,950 --> 01:14:51,580
He's asleep.

948
01:14:54,580 --> 01:14:56,130
Will you wash it?

949
01:14:56,210 --> 01:14:58,340
You do it, please.

950
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:03,050
Put his chin into your shoulder.

951
01:15:03,430 --> 01:15:05,220
I know how.

952
01:15:05,970 --> 01:15:07,010
No, higher.

953
01:15:07,100 --> 01:15:08,470
I know!

954
01:15:09,260 --> 01:15:10,260
That's too weak.

955
01:15:10,310 --> 01:15:11,600
Be quiet...

956
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:19,060
You're not caring for him on purpose?

957
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:20,650
What?

958
01:15:23,530 --> 01:15:25,950
In case you won't be able to let go later.

959
01:15:31,620 --> 01:15:33,250
Why are you laughing?

960
01:15:34,210 --> 01:15:37,750
Women will eat you alive if you're so nice.

961
01:15:40,750 --> 01:15:43,300
That's exactly what Sang-hyun said.

962
01:16:00,270 --> 01:16:01,570
Where are you going?

963
01:16:01,650 --> 01:16:02,980
The convenience store.

964
01:16:03,070 --> 01:16:04,440
Want me to go?

965
01:16:04,530 --> 01:16:08,660
There are things a woman can't ask a man to buy.

966
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:12,330
It might rain. Take an umbrella.

967
01:16:13,370 --> 01:16:15,710
Come and get me if it rains.

968
01:16:17,460 --> 01:16:19,250
With an umbrella.

969
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:27,340
I'll be back!

970
01:16:35,180 --> 01:16:38,270
Where'd you meet the woman you call mom?

971
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:42,110
I had run away, and was sleeping at songdo beach.

972
01:16:42,310 --> 01:16:44,900
She asked if I was hungry.

973
01:16:46,190 --> 01:16:49,240
Did she force you into prostitution?

974
01:16:53,660 --> 01:16:55,830
Are you taking pity on me?

975
01:16:57,830 --> 01:16:58,830
No, it's not that.

976
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:01,460
I did it even before meeting mom.

977
01:17:02,590 --> 01:17:05,510
Then why kill that guy?

978
01:17:07,170 --> 01:17:08,720
Well...

979
01:17:09,470 --> 01:17:11,140
I got upset.

980
01:17:11,850 --> 01:17:13,430
Upset?

981
01:17:13,810 --> 01:17:17,310
He told me to lick him before he took a shower.

982
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:21,770
Did he do anything to make it self-defense?

983
01:17:21,850 --> 01:17:25,230
I can give you a list of my customers if you want.

984
01:17:27,610 --> 01:17:30,360
No need. What I want to know is...

985
01:17:30,450 --> 01:17:32,820
Is this an investigation, or a lecture?

986
01:17:33,160 --> 01:17:35,910
I'll sell the baby as you told me to, don't worry.

987
01:17:37,370 --> 01:17:40,830
We want to help. Both of us.

988
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:47,050
Have you ever abandoned a baby?

989
01:17:47,260 --> 01:17:49,170
Or killed someone?

990
01:17:49,630 --> 01:17:53,510
Fine, then tell us.
Because I can't understand.

991
01:17:56,060 --> 01:17:57,850
Why'd you abandon him?

992
01:17:57,930 --> 01:17:59,930
Outside the box, even.

993
01:18:04,940 --> 01:18:06,690
You saw it?

994
01:18:10,530 --> 01:18:12,860
He'd have died if you left him.

995
01:18:15,950 --> 01:18:18,580
I never intended to see him again.

996
01:18:19,410 --> 01:18:22,000
Then why have him if you can't raise him?

997
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:23,540
I should've aborted him?

998
01:18:23,630 --> 01:18:26,840
Thinking of him, might that be better?

999
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:32,260
Rather than throw him away, killing him before he's born

1000
01:18:32,930 --> 01:18:34,890
is less of a sin?

1001
01:18:43,690 --> 01:18:45,060
If nobody wants him,

1002
01:18:45,150 --> 01:18:48,070
giving birth will just make him miserable.

1003
01:18:48,150 --> 01:18:51,190
Say that in front of Woo-sung,
that I should've killed him first!

1004
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:53,530
You threw him away!

1005
01:19:35,860 --> 01:19:38,070
Hey, listen.

1006
01:19:38,830 --> 01:19:42,790
Can you bring me some clothes?
My button fell off.

1007
01:19:44,290 --> 01:19:47,460
We're in uljin.

1008
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:54,800
Yeah, right?

1009
01:19:59,470 --> 01:20:01,430
Never mind, it's okay.

1010
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:08,650
Check this out. Listen to this song.

1011
01:20:18,700 --> 01:20:20,200
Hello?

1012
01:20:20,660 --> 01:20:24,910
Did you hear it? Remember, that movie we saw?

1013
01:20:25,710 --> 01:20:27,830
It was in that.

1014
01:20:32,170 --> 01:20:33,630
Right...

1015
01:20:35,630 --> 01:20:40,090
Though it doesn't make sense in reality.

1016
01:20:45,980 --> 01:20:47,940
Rice? What rice?

1017
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:49,900
Ah, like at a wedding?

1018
01:20:59,240 --> 01:21:01,620
No, things are fine.

1019
01:21:05,830 --> 01:21:07,370
Sorry.

1020
01:21:15,590 --> 01:21:17,170
Just because.

1021
01:21:29,100 --> 01:21:30,940
Stick the needle in here.

1022
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:34,610
Under the button. Look.

1023
01:21:35,610 --> 01:21:40,570
If you wrap it around a few times, it won't fall off.

1024
01:21:40,780 --> 01:21:42,490
Wow, Dong-soo, how'd you do that?

1025
01:21:42,570 --> 01:21:44,280
- Hae-Jin, you try it.
- I wanna try!

1026
01:21:44,580 --> 01:21:45,870
Come on, try it.

1027
01:21:45,950 --> 01:21:47,870
No, I wanna do this.

1028
01:21:52,710 --> 01:21:55,710
So who are we meeting tomorrow?

1029
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:58,340
They're rich, of course.

1030
01:21:59,090 --> 01:22:01,510
Since they're offering 40 million.

1031
01:22:01,590 --> 01:22:02,970
30 million.

1032
01:22:03,050 --> 01:22:06,010
Right, 30 million.

1033
01:22:06,930 --> 01:22:09,600
Why? Who would you prefer?

1034
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:13,350
Someone pretty like so-young.

1035
01:22:13,850 --> 01:22:15,520
Hey, Dong-soo.

1036
01:22:15,980 --> 01:22:17,770
Learn from him.

1037
01:22:17,980 --> 01:22:21,240
A man needs to slip in praise casually like that.

1038
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:24,070
Thank you for your instruction, master.

1039
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:26,950
What? I didn't hear you.

1040
01:22:27,830 --> 01:22:31,790
They say the eldest son resembles the mom,
and the daughter the dad.

1041
01:22:31,870 --> 01:22:34,130
That's why my daughter is doomed.

1042
01:22:34,540 --> 01:22:36,750
It's okay, you don't live with her.

1043
01:22:37,170 --> 01:22:39,050
That's just superstition.

1044
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:42,510
So you're an eldest daughter?

1045
01:22:42,590 --> 01:22:43,470
Shut up.

1046
01:22:43,550 --> 01:22:45,430
When I look at old photos of my mom,

1047
01:22:45,510 --> 01:22:48,010
sometimes I think it's me.

1048
01:22:50,810 --> 01:22:53,520
That button was about to fall off.

1049
01:22:59,940 --> 01:23:02,450
- Where are you going?
- To wash up.

1050
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:13,210
That kid doesn't know his parents' faces, either.

1051
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:19,880
Sometimes, you know, it's better that way.

1052
01:23:26,550 --> 01:23:31,270
For Woo-sung too, it'll be better if he can't remember my face.

1053
01:23:33,810 --> 01:23:35,770
Why do you say that?

1054
01:23:38,810 --> 01:23:40,860
Because I'm a murderer.

1055
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:44,110
Murder?

1056
01:23:44,820 --> 01:23:46,110
Yeah.

1057
01:23:48,490 --> 01:23:50,160
Who'd you kill?

1058
01:23:52,540 --> 01:23:54,540
Woo-sung's father.

1059
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:00,460
Why?

1060
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:11,310
He said Woo-sung should never have been born,

1061
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:15,270
tried to take him from me.

1062
01:24:18,810 --> 01:24:20,230
What?

1063
01:24:22,900 --> 01:24:26,360
His wife is probably searching for me now.

1064
01:24:30,910 --> 01:24:35,450
So if you'll sell him properly, you can leave me behind.

1065
01:24:45,260 --> 01:24:47,510
I just came out of the hotel.

1066
01:24:48,300 --> 01:24:51,180
And... hold on a sec.

1067
01:24:54,470 --> 01:24:56,640
Let me ask you something.

1068
01:24:56,810 --> 01:24:58,440
Sang-hyun.

1069
01:25:01,480 --> 01:25:03,360
What are you doing here?

1070
01:25:03,480 --> 01:25:07,990
After what so-young told us, I thought I'd check just in case.

1071
01:25:08,950 --> 01:25:10,110
Look.

1072
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:12,030
What is that?

1073
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:16,540
This is a GPS or something.
Where'd you find it?

1074
01:25:16,620 --> 01:25:18,290
In here.

1075
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:22,500
The cops?

1076
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:26,340
The cops wouldn't use an antique like this.

1077
01:25:27,210 --> 01:25:30,550
Then someone's been following us.

1078
01:25:30,720 --> 01:25:34,970
Don't you think? From the father's side.

1079
01:25:39,390 --> 01:25:40,440
Don't do it.

1080
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:41,520
What?

1081
01:25:42,190 --> 01:25:45,230
You were planning to leave without so-young.

1082
01:25:45,860 --> 01:25:46,860
Well...

1083
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:52,320
This time rather than money,

1084
01:25:52,700 --> 01:25:57,370
let's find a buyer so-young is happy with.

1085
01:25:58,620 --> 01:26:02,580
I don't care only about money, you know.

1086
01:26:03,380 --> 01:26:05,170
Good, then.

1087
01:26:06,460 --> 01:26:08,670
I'll take care of this, then.

1088
01:26:11,510 --> 01:26:13,010
What?

1089
01:26:14,300 --> 01:26:16,140
What are you doing?

1090
01:26:40,870 --> 01:26:42,870
I know everything.

1091
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:46,040
Woo-sung's dad is dead.

1092
01:26:46,750 --> 01:26:49,960
So what? As long as you get paid.

1093
01:26:52,510 --> 01:26:55,890
But who wants to buy him?

1094
01:26:59,140 --> 01:27:01,020
The dead man's wife.

1095
01:27:01,390 --> 01:27:03,480
What'll she do with him?

1096
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:06,100
She says she'll raise him.

1097
01:27:06,190 --> 01:27:09,070
Raise him? Don't talk nonsense.

1098
01:27:09,190 --> 01:27:11,230
She'll sell him, right?

1099
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:13,490
Ship him abroad?

1100
01:27:13,650 --> 01:27:15,110
I'm not selling.

1101
01:27:15,700 --> 01:27:17,950
Come out here, now!

1102
01:27:18,030 --> 01:27:19,740
Hey, hey.

1103
01:27:21,160 --> 01:27:22,960
Who the hell are you?

1104
01:27:23,540 --> 01:27:27,500
You're on the father's side?

1105
01:27:27,590 --> 01:27:29,800
Shut up and give me the baby. Come out here!

1106
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:31,260
Come out!

1107
01:27:32,340 --> 01:27:33,840
Hey!

1108
01:27:41,640 --> 01:27:43,850
Careful!

1109
01:27:46,230 --> 01:27:48,810
Hey, did you kill him?

1110
01:27:49,980 --> 01:27:52,780
He's the son of someone I know!

1111
01:27:53,110 --> 01:27:55,070
He's fine, just passed out.

1112
01:27:55,320 --> 01:27:56,410
Dammit.

1113
01:28:00,370 --> 01:28:02,160
Help me out.

1114
01:28:20,430 --> 01:28:22,310
Where are they going now?

1115
01:28:22,390 --> 01:28:25,270
They're driving south on this road,

1116
01:28:25,390 --> 01:28:27,440
but I think we can catch up in 5km.

1117
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:29,020
- Speed up, then.
- Okay.

1118
01:28:29,110 --> 01:28:30,900
We were careless.

1119
01:28:38,530 --> 01:28:40,370
It's the ktx! Ktx!

1120
01:29:18,650 --> 01:29:20,570
I had a dream.

1121
01:29:21,820 --> 01:29:27,790
Years ago I took this train with my daughter, wife and mother

1122
01:29:27,870 --> 01:29:29,960
and went to Wolmido.

1123
01:29:31,380 --> 01:29:34,130
- Back then...
- A good dream, then.

1124
01:29:34,420 --> 01:29:36,670
No, not really.

1125
01:29:43,260 --> 01:29:46,640
Why do you think she told us?

1126
01:29:47,350 --> 01:29:49,640
- Their destination?
- Yes.

1127
01:29:53,020 --> 01:29:55,820
She wants us to follow?

1128
01:29:56,150 --> 01:30:00,070
So that Woo-sung doesn't get taken away?

1129
01:30:02,910 --> 01:30:05,410
That may be what she's thinking.

1130
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:21,630
Will it be okay?

1131
01:30:21,880 --> 01:30:23,680
It's my treat.

1132
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:26,470
Not this.

1133
01:30:29,480 --> 01:30:31,890
I may just go myself.

1134
01:30:34,150 --> 01:30:38,480
That's okay, as long as they don't pay in installments.

1135
01:30:40,610 --> 01:30:42,700
- So-young.
- Yeah?

1136
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:48,330
When you put Woo-sung in the box...

1137
01:30:50,160 --> 01:30:55,170
I mean, did you really think of coming back?

1138
01:31:05,640 --> 01:31:07,300
I'm not sure.

1139
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:16,770
But if I'd met you a bit earlier,

1140
01:31:19,610 --> 01:31:22,570
maybe I wouldn't have had to.

1141
01:31:26,070 --> 01:31:28,450
It's not too late.

1142
01:31:29,290 --> 01:31:31,500
What did you say?

1143
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:34,870
What? Never mind.

1144
01:31:39,340 --> 01:31:42,760
You're keeping so-young all to yourself!

1145
01:31:43,670 --> 01:31:46,180
All right, take the Baton.

1146
01:31:52,270 --> 01:31:54,730
What kind of guy do you like?

1147
01:31:55,100 --> 01:31:56,520
Huh?

1148
01:31:59,230 --> 01:32:00,900
I don't know.

1149
01:32:01,610 --> 01:32:04,530
A guy like you who looks good in overalls.

1150
01:32:07,950 --> 01:32:11,290
Hae-Jin is a great name.

1151
01:32:12,290 --> 01:32:16,370
I like your name.
It means going out to the sea.

1152
01:32:17,670 --> 01:32:21,920
When you grow up, you'll probably work abroad.

1153
01:32:22,590 --> 01:32:24,760
In the premier league?

1154
01:32:26,340 --> 01:32:27,840
Sure.

1155
01:32:30,100 --> 01:32:33,680
- Who named Woo-sung?
- Me.

1156
01:32:34,100 --> 01:32:35,850
Lucky him.

1157
01:32:36,060 --> 01:32:38,940
What does it mean?

1158
01:32:44,070 --> 01:32:48,160
"Woo" means wings, and "sung" means the stars.

1159
01:32:48,570 --> 01:32:51,280
I hope he goes far, far away.

1160
01:32:51,580 --> 01:32:57,160
If you cross the sea, Woo-sung will go to the stars.

1161
01:32:57,870 --> 01:32:59,830
Like an astronaut?

1162
01:33:00,130 --> 01:33:02,040
Or a pilot?

1163
01:33:03,210 --> 01:33:05,510
We 're like brothers.

1164
01:33:31,450 --> 01:33:32,780
Hello?

1165
01:33:32,870 --> 01:33:36,250
I'm wondering if we can meet two hours earlier?

1166
01:33:36,450 --> 01:33:37,910
See you at 12.

1167
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,460
Yes, thank you.

1168
01:33:48,470 --> 01:33:50,970
Today is about Woo-sung.

1169
01:33:51,470 --> 01:33:52,850
Got it?

1170
01:33:52,930 --> 01:33:55,470
- Can't I be adopted too?
- No.

1171
01:33:55,560 --> 01:33:56,930
No way.

1172
01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:14,070
Thank you so much for agreeing to our request.

1173
01:34:14,870 --> 01:34:17,490
As I told you already,

1174
01:34:19,410 --> 01:34:23,080
our baby was stillborn.

1175
01:34:23,540 --> 01:34:26,550
Since it could well happen again...

1176
01:34:27,210 --> 01:34:29,760
It must've been hard on you.

1177
01:34:30,340 --> 01:34:35,930
It was a girl, a cute baby just like him.

1178
01:34:36,930 --> 01:34:41,310
Have a seat.
Would you like coffee? Ice coffee?

1179
01:34:42,020 --> 01:34:43,480
Yes.

1180
01:34:44,770 --> 01:34:48,860
Could I hold him?

1181
01:34:48,940 --> 01:34:50,690
Yes, sure.

1182
01:34:55,410 --> 01:34:56,580
Woo-sung.

1183
01:35:01,370 --> 01:35:03,750
It's okay, don't be scared.

1184
01:35:03,830 --> 01:35:05,960
Is he hungry? The bottle...

1185
01:35:06,040 --> 01:35:07,750
Were you hungry?

1186
01:35:08,250 --> 01:35:13,760
If you don't mind, could I try breast feeding him?

1187
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:16,260
It's okay?

1188
01:35:16,680 --> 01:35:20,640
- Then, over here.
- Thank you.

1189
01:35:24,020 --> 01:35:25,690
Woo-sung.

1190
01:35:26,440 --> 01:35:27,940
It's okay...

1191
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:29,980
It's okay...

1192
01:35:31,860 --> 01:35:33,450
Oh my.

1193
01:35:36,660 --> 01:35:39,120
Look, he's eating.

1194
01:35:41,330 --> 01:35:43,080
Is that good?

1195
01:35:43,710 --> 01:35:45,830
Does it taste good?

1196
01:35:51,550 --> 01:35:56,840
I didn't mention this in my email,
but can I propose one condition?

1197
01:35:58,010 --> 01:36:00,180
Thinking of the future,

1198
01:36:00,680 --> 01:36:04,140
we want to raise Woo-sung as our real child.

1199
01:36:04,640 --> 01:36:08,270
So we'd like for this to be

1200
01:36:08,980 --> 01:36:12,730
the last meeting between him and his birth mother.

1201
01:36:13,530 --> 01:36:18,950
I know it will be hard, but think it over for today.

1202
01:36:21,990 --> 01:36:23,370
Wow!

1203
01:36:31,710 --> 01:36:34,050
So-young, sit here!

1204
01:36:46,020 --> 01:36:48,560
That came out well.

1205
01:36:56,150 --> 01:36:58,450
Wow, a monorail!

1206
01:36:59,070 --> 01:37:00,410
Hi!

1207
01:37:01,370 --> 01:37:02,910
Hi!

1208
01:37:09,420 --> 01:37:11,000
Let's take photos!

1209
01:37:11,080 --> 01:37:12,590
Photos!

1210
01:37:13,170 --> 01:37:15,090
Let's go in!

1211
01:37:16,300 --> 01:37:18,010
How much is it?

1212
01:37:19,890 --> 01:37:21,680
4,000 won?

1213
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:30,440
Not yet, we're not done.

1214
01:37:30,520 --> 01:37:31,230
Just a minute.

1215
01:37:31,310 --> 01:37:33,650
I want the monkey doll!

1216
01:37:34,150 --> 01:37:36,530
Oh no, I better not miss this.

1217
01:37:39,990 --> 01:37:40,990
Hold on.

1218
01:37:41,030 --> 01:37:42,070
Do it!

1219
01:37:46,950 --> 01:37:48,330
Hae-Jin.

1220
01:37:48,410 --> 01:37:50,120
There's a soccer field. Look.

1221
01:37:50,210 --> 01:37:51,830
- Yeah.
- Huh?

1222
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:53,710
It's a soccer field!

1223
01:37:55,130 --> 01:37:59,170
I don't like heights, I'm scared.

1224
01:37:59,550 --> 01:38:03,140
Hey, you said you wanted to ride this.

1225
01:38:03,720 --> 01:38:06,060
Back then... I was just improvising...

1226
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:08,640
What's wrong?

1227
01:38:08,730 --> 01:38:10,690
You're not going to throw up?

1228
01:38:10,770 --> 01:38:13,150
You've gone pale. Are you okay?

1229
01:38:13,310 --> 01:38:16,110
- Don't throw up.
- Yeah.

1230
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:19,190
- Don't throw up here.
- Yeah.

1231
01:38:19,320 --> 01:38:23,280
Look at you, I wanted to treat you.

1232
01:38:23,490 --> 01:38:25,330
Bring me there instead.

1233
01:38:25,410 --> 01:38:26,120
Where?

1234
01:38:26,200 --> 01:38:27,200
The car wash.

1235
01:38:27,290 --> 01:38:28,450
What?

1236
01:38:28,540 --> 01:38:29,410
The car wash.

1237
01:38:29,500 --> 01:38:31,330
- The car wash?
- Yeah.

1238
01:38:31,670 --> 01:38:34,960
- You like getting soaked?
- Yeah.

1239
01:38:36,460 --> 01:38:40,590
Okay, if things go well tomorrow, let's go again.

1240
01:38:41,170 --> 01:38:43,390
Tell me when we reach the ground.

1241
01:38:43,470 --> 01:38:44,850
Okay.

1242
01:38:45,640 --> 01:38:47,720
- Don't throw up.
- Yeah.

1243
01:38:47,850 --> 01:38:49,680
You punk.

1244
01:39:06,280 --> 01:39:08,490
Should we look a bit longer?

1245
01:39:13,290 --> 01:39:17,000
Or we could not put him up for adoption.

1246
01:39:20,920 --> 01:39:22,380
Still...

1247
01:39:24,720 --> 01:39:26,510
We could even

1248
01:39:27,180 --> 01:39:29,310
just raise him ourselves.

1249
01:39:35,940 --> 01:39:37,440
The four of us.

1250
01:39:39,070 --> 01:39:42,650
Or with Hae-Jin. Five would be nice.

1251
01:39:45,530 --> 01:39:49,620
That's a strange family. Who's the dad?

1252
01:39:55,500 --> 01:39:57,790
I'll be Woo-sung's dad.

1253
01:40:02,380 --> 01:40:05,340
That's what men say when they propose.

1254
01:40:07,340 --> 01:40:08,970
Really?

1255
01:40:19,980 --> 01:40:23,320
I wish we could start over again like that.

1256
01:40:37,250 --> 01:40:39,250
But it can't happen.

1257
01:40:41,380 --> 01:40:43,840
I'll be arrested soon.

1258
01:40:50,390 --> 01:40:56,390
"A Busan-based prostitute murdered a man, and while on the run,

1259
01:40:56,730 --> 01:41:00,110
left her child in a baby box."

1260
01:41:12,660 --> 01:41:14,830
Is this how you'll appear?

1261
01:41:18,330 --> 01:41:20,920
These days they don't blur the faces.

1262
01:41:23,380 --> 01:41:24,920
They don't?

1263
01:41:31,550 --> 01:41:33,970
This thing's shaking, right?

1264
01:41:35,970 --> 01:41:39,390
It's okay. It's because we're at the top.

1265
01:41:42,520 --> 01:41:45,360
It's even scarier, not being able to see.

1266
01:41:46,610 --> 01:41:48,150
It's strange.

1267
01:42:03,500 --> 01:42:07,010
Seeing you makes my heart feel a bit lighter.

1268
01:42:08,920 --> 01:42:10,590
In what way?

1269
01:42:11,470 --> 01:42:13,390
My mom too

1270
01:42:15,350 --> 01:42:19,180
may have had some unavoidable reason to abandon me.

1271
01:42:29,280 --> 01:42:30,950
Even so,

1272
01:42:33,320 --> 01:42:36,030
you don't need to forgive her.

1273
01:42:37,830 --> 01:42:41,250
She's still an awful mother.

1274
01:42:49,800 --> 01:42:51,260
Then,

1275
01:42:53,640 --> 01:42:56,350
instead I'll forgive you.

1276
01:43:09,990 --> 01:43:12,950
Woo-sung will never forgive me.

1277
01:43:18,200 --> 01:43:20,040
You abandoned him

1278
01:43:21,500 --> 01:43:25,040
so he wouldn't grow up as a murderer's son.

1279
01:43:31,970 --> 01:43:33,800
Still,

1280
01:43:36,720 --> 01:43:39,010
I threw him away.

1281
01:43:59,780 --> 01:44:03,500
I guess I'm the one who wanted to sell him the most.

1282
01:44:07,500 --> 01:44:10,090
We're more like brokers than they are.

1283
01:44:30,440 --> 01:44:35,110
It was the same with you, when you were young.

1284
01:44:35,360 --> 01:44:37,530
You almost threw up,

1285
01:44:37,610 --> 01:44:40,620
but you didn't, I held you...

1286
01:44:41,280 --> 01:44:45,330
I don't remember. I was three years old.

1287
01:44:47,120 --> 01:44:49,460
Was it that long ago?

1288
01:44:51,460 --> 01:44:56,720
Wow, you're already solving such difficult problems?

1289
01:45:01,390 --> 01:45:03,930
What? Who is it?

1290
01:45:04,520 --> 01:45:05,890
Mom.

1291
01:45:05,980 --> 01:45:07,440
Answer it.

1292
01:45:08,940 --> 01:45:10,110
Is it a message?

1293
01:45:10,190 --> 01:45:11,650
Answer her.

1294
01:45:11,980 --> 01:45:14,150
Should we send her a selfie?

1295
01:45:15,110 --> 01:45:17,900
Here's your order. Enjoy.

1296
01:45:19,530 --> 01:45:22,660
Eat some. It looks good.

1297
01:45:24,450 --> 01:45:28,920
Tomorrow I'm getting paid a lot of money.

1298
01:45:29,830 --> 01:45:35,760
Then maybe the three of us, like before, in Busan...

1299
01:45:36,840 --> 01:45:39,720
Or I can come to Seoul.

1300
01:45:41,090 --> 01:45:45,680
We don't need money, just stop calling.

1301
01:45:47,350 --> 01:45:49,850
That's what mom said.

1302
01:45:51,150 --> 01:45:53,730
Ah, mom...

1303
01:45:57,190 --> 01:46:01,240
But really, she said not to come to the house.

1304
01:46:04,410 --> 01:46:08,370
Last time I drank too much...

1305
01:46:08,450 --> 01:46:11,830
Look! This straw,

1306
01:46:12,380 --> 01:46:14,590
it's shaped like a heart.

1307
01:46:17,090 --> 01:46:18,630
Dad,

1308
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:22,390
there's a new baby coming.

1309
01:46:25,010 --> 01:46:26,600
Mom's?

1310
01:46:27,430 --> 01:46:30,310
Yeah. A boy.

1311
01:46:34,400 --> 01:46:36,570
Is that so?

1312
01:46:40,110 --> 01:46:43,700
Then please say congratulations to mom.

1313
01:46:45,530 --> 01:46:47,330
Sorry.

1314
01:46:48,540 --> 01:46:50,410
No, no...

1315
01:46:52,920 --> 01:46:58,170
Still, in the future...
I'm still your dad...

1316
01:46:58,840 --> 01:47:00,300
Right?

1317
01:47:02,050 --> 01:47:03,720
Really?

1318
01:47:08,470 --> 01:47:10,020
Of course.

1319
01:47:13,020 --> 01:47:14,650
I'll be going.

1320
01:47:18,020 --> 01:47:19,860
I'll see you.

1321
01:48:05,110 --> 01:48:07,120
Steak, steak!

1322
01:48:10,450 --> 01:48:14,620
To wish us success for tomorrow.

1323
01:48:24,720 --> 01:48:27,050
Woo-sung, say "my brother Hae-Jin"!

1324
01:48:27,140 --> 01:48:29,140
"Hae-Jin, Hae-Jin"!

1325
01:48:30,760 --> 01:48:32,600
He said "Hae-Jin"!

1326
01:48:32,930 --> 01:48:34,810
Yeah, right.

1327
01:48:35,640 --> 01:48:37,770
Woo-sung, you did, right?

1328
01:48:37,850 --> 01:48:39,610
He definitely did.

1329
01:48:40,020 --> 01:48:43,650
Woo-sung, you can't ever forget us!

1330
01:48:44,070 --> 01:48:46,240
He'll forget us right away.

1331
01:48:46,570 --> 01:48:50,830
Hae-Jin, you can remember all of this for him.

1332
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:55,910
This guy is such a dork sometimes.

1333
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:57,920
I totally agree.

1334
01:48:59,710 --> 01:49:02,500
Woo-sung, today was so much fun.

1335
01:49:03,090 --> 01:49:06,010
So let's not forget!

1336
01:49:07,680 --> 01:49:11,430
So-young, you never talk to Woo-sung.

1337
01:49:13,430 --> 01:49:14,430
That's not true.

1338
01:49:15,020 --> 01:49:18,140
He's right, I've never seen it.

1339
01:49:20,860 --> 01:49:23,610
It's the end, so say something.

1340
01:49:24,650 --> 01:49:26,440
What should I say?

1341
01:49:28,150 --> 01:49:29,990
Anything.

1342
01:49:31,950 --> 01:49:37,120
"Thank you for being born."
You know, that kind of thing.

1343
01:49:39,540 --> 01:49:41,290
He won't even understand.

1344
01:49:41,380 --> 01:49:43,170
Even so,

1345
01:49:43,960 --> 01:49:47,420
just once in his life...

1346
01:49:50,300 --> 01:49:51,800
Shit.

1347
01:49:58,100 --> 01:50:02,440
So-young, then say it to all of us.

1348
01:50:03,270 --> 01:50:05,150
- All of you?
- Yeah.

1349
01:50:05,730 --> 01:50:06,980
All four of you?

1350
01:50:07,070 --> 01:50:08,360
Yeah.

1351
01:50:08,650 --> 01:50:10,410
That dummy.

1352
01:50:10,780 --> 01:50:12,570
Iwipass.

1353
01:50:12,870 --> 01:50:15,580
Hey, you're the one who suggested it.

1354
01:50:17,950 --> 01:50:20,040
Then I'll pass, too.

1355
01:50:28,130 --> 01:50:30,340
All right, I'll say it.

1356
01:50:33,050 --> 01:50:35,560
Everyone close your eyes then.

1357
01:50:36,510 --> 01:50:38,100
Hold on!

1358
01:50:40,060 --> 01:50:41,730
Let's turn out the light.

1359
01:50:42,600 --> 01:50:44,860
What?

1360
01:50:45,060 --> 01:50:47,190
Then how will I eat the steak?

1361
01:50:47,280 --> 01:50:49,990
Hey! Don't turn it out.

1362
01:50:50,780 --> 01:50:52,610
Don't turn it out.

1363
01:50:56,370 --> 01:50:58,580
Okay, here we go.

1364
01:51:03,750 --> 01:51:08,250
Hae-Jin, thank you for being born.

1365
01:51:12,840 --> 01:51:14,470
Sang-hyun,

1366
01:51:17,100 --> 01:51:19,310
thank you for being born.

1367
01:51:22,190 --> 01:51:23,770
Dong-soo,

1368
01:51:26,900 --> 01:51:28,940
thank you for being born.

1369
01:51:33,780 --> 01:51:35,410
Woo-sung,

1370
01:51:38,780 --> 01:51:40,540
thank you...

1371
01:51:43,500 --> 01:51:45,000
For being born.

1372
01:51:47,630 --> 01:51:49,210
So-young...

1373
01:51:53,470 --> 01:51:56,260
Thank you for being born.

1374
01:52:08,150 --> 01:52:11,070
Okay, good night everyone.

1375
01:52:12,610 --> 01:52:14,240
Good night.

1376
01:52:54,190 --> 01:52:56,400
I've got a proposition.

1377
01:53:02,080 --> 01:53:04,790
We'll say you turned yourself in here.

1378
01:53:06,210 --> 01:53:07,580
What?

1379
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:11,250
No need to sell Woo-sung now.

1380
01:53:12,420 --> 01:53:15,510
You say to sell him, and now you say don't?

1381
01:53:15,760 --> 01:53:21,550
Confess to accidental manslaughter,
and you can be out in 3 years.

1382
01:53:22,810 --> 01:53:26,520
Then someday you can live with Woo-sung again.

1383
01:53:30,020 --> 01:53:35,070
Those two people can never become parents, unfortunately.

1384
01:53:37,190 --> 01:53:39,110
Neither can I.

1385
01:53:40,990 --> 01:53:43,700
The couple we met today said,

1386
01:53:45,910 --> 01:53:49,370
Woo-sung wasn't abandoned, he was protected.

1387
01:53:50,290 --> 01:53:53,590
That they'll tell him that every day.

1388
01:53:55,960 --> 01:53:59,470
I want him to be raised by people like them.

1389
01:54:03,430 --> 01:54:05,310
If so,

1390
01:54:11,020 --> 01:54:12,730
If so,

1391
01:54:15,020 --> 01:54:17,860
he won't have to live like me.

1392
01:54:39,880 --> 01:54:41,760
Where are you going?

1393
01:54:45,350 --> 01:54:47,310
So-young's gone, too.

1394
01:54:47,640 --> 01:54:51,810
So-young's probably outside with the police.

1395
01:54:54,060 --> 01:54:56,440
So-young wouldn't sell us out.

1396
01:54:56,520 --> 01:54:58,940
Yes, she would.

1397
01:54:59,690 --> 01:55:03,160
She'd do anything for Woo-sung.

1398
01:55:04,660 --> 01:55:08,540
But that's okay.

1399
01:55:13,830 --> 01:55:18,300
When you're a parent, you'll understand.

1400
01:55:22,300 --> 01:55:24,430
If she sells us out,

1401
01:55:26,260 --> 01:55:28,930
can she start over again?

1402
01:55:30,640 --> 01:55:32,480
Sure.

1403
01:55:32,850 --> 01:55:37,270
Maybe even with Woo-sung.

1404
01:55:56,670 --> 01:55:59,130
You go first, I'll join you soon.

1405
01:56:02,670 --> 01:56:04,680
Hey, come here.

1406
01:56:04,760 --> 01:56:05,760
Look, tae-ho.

1407
01:56:05,800 --> 01:56:06,470
I said come here!

1408
01:56:06,550 --> 01:56:07,820
- Listen to me for a sec.
- Hey, you!

1409
01:56:07,850 --> 01:56:09,100
- Listen.
- Let go!

1410
01:56:09,180 --> 01:56:11,430
You haven't given up yet?

1411
01:56:11,520 --> 01:56:13,270
Of course not!

1412
01:56:14,690 --> 01:56:16,770
Just think about it.

1413
01:56:17,190 --> 01:56:19,230
If that woman raises him,

1414
01:56:19,400 --> 01:56:22,860
how will he grow up? Will he be happy?

1415
01:56:23,400 --> 01:56:25,530
What the hell's come over you?

1416
01:56:25,650 --> 01:56:27,030
You're just a damn broker.

1417
01:56:27,110 --> 01:56:30,080
Let go of me! Shit!

1418
01:56:30,160 --> 01:56:31,740
Listen to me.

1419
01:56:31,990 --> 01:56:33,700
Instead of this,

1420
01:56:36,670 --> 01:56:39,880
let's take that 40 million and work together.

1421
01:56:42,760 --> 01:56:46,010
You're talking nonsense! Why should I?

1422
01:56:48,760 --> 01:56:51,350
I'm not going to work with Dong-soo anymore.

1423
01:56:54,810 --> 01:56:56,350
What?

1424
01:56:57,520 --> 01:56:59,440
Those guys,

1425
01:57:02,690 --> 01:57:05,440
they don't need me anymore.

1426
01:57:12,370 --> 01:57:15,960
My wife got really mad at me for saying that yesterday.

1427
01:57:16,500 --> 01:57:21,250
To ask that all of a sudden isn't fair to her.

1428
01:57:21,790 --> 01:57:26,340
So please tell his mother, whenever she wants to see him,

1429
01:57:26,470 --> 01:57:28,970
she can call us anytime.

1430
01:57:29,970 --> 01:57:33,850
We don't want to hide anything from the child.

1431
01:57:36,350 --> 01:57:38,440
It would've been nice

1432
01:57:40,150 --> 01:57:46,070
to give Woo-sung to people like you.

1433
01:57:51,120 --> 01:57:52,830
Who's that?

1434
01:57:53,200 --> 01:57:54,950
Is it Sang-hyun?

1435
01:57:58,790 --> 01:58:00,330
Who are you?

1436
01:58:01,830 --> 01:58:03,380
The police.

1437
01:58:04,040 --> 01:58:05,670
What's the matter?

1438
01:58:05,750 --> 01:58:08,720
You're being charged with illegally purchasing a child.

1439
01:58:08,800 --> 01:58:11,180
- Honey!
- Stay inside for a sec.

1440
01:58:11,300 --> 01:58:13,430
Can we talk outside?

1441
01:58:14,390 --> 01:58:18,310
Kim Dong-soo?
You're arrested for suspected child trafficking.

1442
01:58:18,600 --> 01:58:20,190
Dong-soo!

1443
01:58:27,190 --> 01:58:28,990
What about so-young?

1444
01:58:30,280 --> 01:58:32,160
She turned herself in.

1445
01:58:34,660 --> 01:58:36,450
And the other man?

1446
01:58:39,250 --> 01:58:40,750
I don't know.

1447
01:58:43,460 --> 01:58:45,590
- Take them in.
- Okay.

1448
01:58:57,810 --> 01:58:59,390
Let's go.

1449
01:59:33,970 --> 01:59:35,050
For our next story,

1450
01:59:35,140 --> 01:59:40,850
we have new info on the body found in a Seoul
underground shopping center.

1451
01:59:41,020 --> 01:59:44,020
The victim, surnamed shin, was a gangster from Busan,

1452
01:59:44,100 --> 01:59:50,400
and 40 million won in cash
has been found in the victim's motel room.

1453
01:59:50,530 --> 01:59:57,070
Police are investigating the matter
as a potential crime or accident.

1454
01:59:57,370 --> 01:59:58,580
Next,

1455
01:59:58,660 --> 02:00:00,490
to celebrate family month in May,

1456
02:00:00,580 --> 02:00:04,330
events for families are scheduled across the country.

1457
02:00:17,930 --> 02:00:19,640
Hold on a second.

1458
02:00:20,810 --> 02:00:22,680
What are you kids doing?

1459
02:00:22,850 --> 02:00:24,980
What are you doing?

1460
02:00:39,030 --> 02:00:40,780
Woo-sung!

1461
02:00:41,450 --> 02:00:43,250
Woo-sung!

1462
02:00:49,750 --> 02:00:52,960
Did you have fun? Want to go in the ocean?

1463
02:01:23,740 --> 02:01:27,330
Ms. Moon So-young, how have you been?

1464
02:01:28,370 --> 02:01:31,540
I was glad to hear your sentence was reduced,

1465
02:01:31,630 --> 02:01:33,880
and you've been released.

1466
02:01:35,420 --> 02:01:37,670
It's been 3 years that I've been caring for Woo-sung,

1467
02:01:37,760 --> 02:01:41,930
as you requested that day.

1468
02:01:43,760 --> 02:01:48,060
On the 75th this month, for an hour starting at 72 noon,

1469
02:01:48,270 --> 02:01:51,810
in the park across from Busan sky land,

1470
02:01:52,110 --> 02:01:54,820
Woo-sung and I will wait for you.

1471
02:01:56,280 --> 02:02:00,360
We still don't know anything about Sang-hyun's whereabouts,

1472
02:02:00,490 --> 02:02:03,830
but I invited Dong-soo and Hae-Jin.

1473
02:02:04,120 --> 02:02:09,120
Busan Sky Land

1474
02:02:13,750 --> 02:02:16,340
Hae-Jin, get in the van!

1475
02:02:17,460 --> 02:02:20,800
Mr. Yoon and his wife are on probation,

1476
02:02:20,930 --> 02:02:24,510
so the they're not allowed to adopt Woo-sung as you wished,

1477
02:02:24,600 --> 02:02:28,850
but they sometimes come and play with him.

1478
02:02:30,810 --> 02:02:35,770
If you can't come this time, we'll gather again next month.

1479
02:02:37,150 --> 02:02:42,320
I hope we can all discuss Woo-sung's future.

1480
02:02:48,450 --> 02:02:50,080
Thank you.

1481
02:02:55,290 --> 02:02:57,460
Come again!
