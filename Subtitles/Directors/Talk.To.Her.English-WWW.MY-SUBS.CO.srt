00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,120
TALK TO HER

3
00:03:26,059 --> 00:03:29,379
The stage is full of wooden
chairs and tables.

4
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:33,780
Two women come out with robes.

5
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:37,740
Their eyes are closed.
Like two sleepwalkers.

6
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:42,300
You get scared... They trip
on everything, poor them.

7
00:03:42,621 --> 00:03:46,141
But suddenly, a man appears.

8
00:03:46,581 --> 00:03:51,061
With a very sad face, the
saddest I have ever seen.

9
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:55,182
He pushes tables and chairs
out of their way.

10
00:03:57,062 --> 00:04:00,102
You can't imagine how touching
it was.

11
00:04:01,543 --> 00:04:05,143
Someone was sitting next to me.
In his 40s, handsome.

12
00:04:06,223 --> 00:04:09,543
He cried with emotion,
lots of times.

13
00:04:09,823 --> 00:04:13,704
I don't understand why...
It was very beautiful!

14
00:04:15,264 --> 00:04:17,384
I have a surprise for you!

15
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:28,545
I have an autograph of
Rina Baus for you.

16
00:04:28,826 --> 00:04:31,306
I had to buy the photo.

17
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:35,976
It is in english and says:

18
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:39,387
I hope you surpass all
the obstacles...

19
00:04:39,827 --> 00:04:42,187
...and start dancing.

20
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:09,630
- She has her period.
- It's early.

21
00:06:17,997 --> 00:06:19,717
Good evening.

22
00:06:25,638 --> 00:06:28,278
Benigno, can you
stay tonight?

23
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:31,879
My sister can't,
and I don't have anyone else.

24
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:34,959
Why did you come?
You should have called.

25
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:38,560
I am not taking advantage of you.
This week you did 3 nights.

26
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,680
Don't worry. A free afternoon
is enough for me.

27
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,480
I have to see the house
workers. It's a mess.

28
00:06:48,321 --> 00:06:50,791
And to frame a photo.

29
00:06:50,841 --> 00:06:55,121
My condition is not improving.
The hospital will decide.

30
00:06:55,641 --> 00:06:58,602
Your husband left you
and the children.

31
00:06:58,882 --> 00:07:02,482
Just come the nights you can.
We will be ok.

32
00:07:05,202 --> 00:07:07,163
Thanks a lot.

33
00:07:08,363 --> 00:07:11,723
- You cut off the intestinal food.
- She couldn't take it.

34
00:07:11,963 --> 00:07:15,123
- We will try again tomorrow.
- Yes, go now.

35
00:07:16,404 --> 00:07:18,324
And keep the spirits up!

36
00:07:25,365 --> 00:07:30,045
Six bulls and a woman.
Wednesday at Briuega.

37
00:07:31,205 --> 00:07:34,846
Lydia P Gonzales will
fight six bulls.

38
00:07:36,646 --> 00:07:39,326
Why such a drastic decision?

39
00:07:39,446 --> 00:07:42,966
It's my job. 2 bulls, or 6.
Whatever they say.

40
00:07:43,367 --> 00:07:46,607
People say a lot of bullfighters
won't fight with you...

41
00:07:46,657 --> 00:07:48,912
...because you are a woman.

42
00:07:48,962 --> 00:07:51,167
People can say what they want.

43
00:07:51,487 --> 00:07:54,888
Too much chauvinism in bullfighting,
but there are exceptions.

44
00:07:55,288 --> 00:08:00,048
Nino Valencia was happy to share
billing with you for several months.

45
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:05,969
Do you think he did it
to promote himself?

46
00:08:06,329 --> 00:08:08,569
And when he succeeded that,
he abandoned you?

47
00:08:08,849 --> 00:08:11,770
I told you, I don't want
to talk about this!

48
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:14,970
But by talking about
certain problems...

49
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,850
...is the first step
towards their solution.

50
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,451
- Nino Valencia...
- Enough!

51
00:08:20,811 --> 00:08:24,411
My dear Lydia, let me
finish the question.

52
00:08:24,461 --> 00:08:28,011
I am not discussing this.
I told you earlier.

53
00:08:28,131 --> 00:08:32,372
You didn't say anything earlier!
It's bad what you are saying!

54
00:08:32,422 --> 00:08:35,402
They will think
it's a fixed interview.

55
00:08:35,452 --> 00:08:39,253
And I am on of the few who
dare say the truth...

56
00:08:39,453 --> 00:08:42,363
...and you should dare accept

57
00:08:42,413 --> 00:08:45,613
...that Nino Valencia
took advantage of you.

58
00:08:46,013 --> 00:08:50,494
He shared with you not only
the fame, but sex as well.

59
00:08:50,544 --> 00:08:53,934
And he left you when
time was right.

60
00:08:55,294 --> 00:08:58,335
Juan Luis, Marco here...
How are you?

61
00:08:58,935 --> 00:09:01,095
I want to ask you something.

62
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:05,215
I would like to do an article
about Lydia Gonzales.

63
00:09:06,135 --> 00:09:08,336
Yes, I see it too...

64
00:09:10,976 --> 00:09:13,736
I would like to do something
deep.

65
00:09:15,657 --> 00:09:18,817
For the Sunday issue?
Great...

66
00:10:12,783 --> 00:10:16,663
- The woman has gone crazy!
- She dedicates it to you.

67
00:10:17,063 --> 00:10:20,744
She would let the bull injur
her, just so that you see it.

68
00:10:21,264 --> 00:10:24,264
You shouldn't have come,
especially you.

69
00:11:13,189 --> 00:11:16,190
Don't tell me anything.
I know what I am doing.

70
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:20,550
Nino should concentrate.
He doesn't want any more worries.

71
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:24,790
Nothing to worry about. He should
just come to pick up his stuff.

72
00:11:25,511 --> 00:11:29,231
- Or tell me where to send them.
- Send them at my place.

73
00:11:29,281 --> 00:11:32,951
He, himself, should say so.
This is nothing to do with you.

74
00:11:35,392 --> 00:11:37,792
You can leave whenever you want.

75
00:11:38,112 --> 00:11:40,872
- Good evening.
- Scotch on the rocks, please.

76
00:11:40,922 --> 00:11:44,113
- What glass do you prefer?
- A tall one.

77
00:11:48,713 --> 00:11:51,713
Can I talk to you for
a minute, please?

78
00:11:53,394 --> 00:11:56,554
Forget it. When something is
over, it's over.

79
00:11:58,074 --> 00:12:01,714
- What are you saying?
- Can I talk to you?

80
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:07,995
If you take me to Madrid,
we can talk on the way.

81
00:12:08,045 --> 00:12:10,115
It will be my pleasure.

82
00:12:22,797 --> 00:12:26,037
- Who named you Lydia;
- My father.

83
00:12:26,277 --> 00:12:29,397
It's as if he sealed your destiny.

84
00:12:29,517 --> 00:12:33,798
He always wanted to be a bullfighter,
but stayed a banderillero.

85
00:12:34,518 --> 00:12:38,198
He is the one that was there
for me, more than anyone else.

86
00:12:38,638 --> 00:12:40,919
But he died last year.

87
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:44,159
I am sorry.

88
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:48,159
'El Pais' wants me to do a profile
on you for their Sunday issue.

89
00:12:48,439 --> 00:12:51,800
Do you write on bullfighting?
I don't know your name.

90
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,200
To be honest,
I know nothing of it.

91
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,081
But I know a lot about
desperate women.

92
00:13:00,481 --> 00:13:03,761
And who told you I am
desperate?

93
00:13:04,081 --> 00:13:07,522
- This is the impression I have.
- Bullfighting doesn't interest you.

94
00:13:07,572 --> 00:13:10,562
You are interested in my
relationship with Nino Valencia.

95
00:13:10,842 --> 00:13:13,882
Tell El Pais to leave me alone!

96
00:13:51,686 --> 00:13:54,247
- Take me from here!
- What's going on?

97
00:13:54,327 --> 00:13:57,967
Take me from here! There is
a snake in the kitchen.

98
00:13:58,287 --> 00:14:01,327
- Give me the keys.
- The door is open.

99
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:03,808
Calm down.
And stay there.

100
00:15:33,977 --> 00:15:35,978
My purse.

101
00:15:37,818 --> 00:15:40,258
Take me to a hotel.

102
00:15:40,618 --> 00:15:43,298
I am never coming back to
this house.

103
00:15:44,018 --> 00:15:47,659
- To which hotel?
- To Eurobuilding, lets say.

104
00:16:16,262 --> 00:16:19,462
Don't tell anyone about
the snake, please.

105
00:16:20,342 --> 00:16:22,983
Only my family knows.

106
00:16:23,103 --> 00:16:26,343
I always respect other
people's phobias.

107
00:16:26,703 --> 00:16:30,824
After what you have done, how
can I say no to the profile?

108
00:16:31,584 --> 00:16:35,544
Think about it again. I will
call tomorrow, tell me then.

109
00:16:36,344 --> 00:16:38,624
Thanks for everything.

110
00:17:00,867 --> 00:17:04,667
Do you want me to stay? I can
sleep in the sofa.

111
00:17:04,867 --> 00:17:08,028
No, I need to get used to
being alone.

112
00:17:48,952 --> 00:17:50,832
Do you wash her?

113
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:52,992
What do you think?

114
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:56,313
- How was the night?
- Normal.

115
00:17:56,713 --> 00:18:00,273
- Give it to me. I will do it.
- I am going now.

116
00:18:00,473 --> 00:18:02,753
- Good bye.
- Bye, Matilde.

117
00:18:06,114 --> 00:18:08,114
It's so hot!

118
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:12,114
- Lets cut her hair.
- short, it's more practical.

119
00:18:13,035 --> 00:18:16,075
We will leave it as it was
when she came here...

120
00:18:16,355 --> 00:18:19,235
...so that she is not surprised
when she wakes up.

121
00:18:19,285 --> 00:18:22,236
After 4 years, it will be great.

122
00:18:22,316 --> 00:18:24,796
I believe in miracles.
So should you.

123
00:18:24,846 --> 00:18:27,796
- Why me?
- Because you need them.

124
00:18:28,036 --> 00:18:32,077
One might happen to you,
and you will not know.

125
00:18:32,797 --> 00:18:34,837
So hot!

126
00:18:35,077 --> 00:18:37,107
I took something from the
drugstore...

127
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:40,158
...to help stop the perspiration
stains on my uniform.

128
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:43,998
My armpits are ok,
but look at my face.

129
00:18:44,048 --> 00:18:46,358
- What's it called?
- Perspirex.

130
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:57,239
It's Marco...
Remember me?

131
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:57,800
- Sure.

132
00:18:57,999 --> 00:19:00,440
- How are you?
- Naked.

133
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,561
I need to buy some clothes.
That's all I've got.

134
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:11,521
I can bring you some
from your place.

135
00:19:11,881 --> 00:19:14,961
I don't want anything from there.
Maybe another time.

136
00:19:15,281 --> 00:19:17,402
- Where are we going?
- To Sybilla.

137
00:19:17,642 --> 00:19:20,082
- You think I am crazy.
- Why?

138
00:19:20,362 --> 00:19:23,842
- Because I don't want to go home.
- No, I understand.

139
00:19:24,282 --> 00:19:28,403
When I separated, I couldn't
sleep in the same bed...

140
00:19:28,763 --> 00:19:31,803
I was sleeping in the sofa,
in the living room.

141
00:19:32,003 --> 00:19:36,204
For a week. Until I finally
bought a new bed.

142
00:19:36,604 --> 00:19:38,724
So, you are separated.

143
00:19:39,484 --> 00:19:41,364
I am alone.

144
00:19:42,284 --> 00:19:45,885
AFTER A FEW MONTHS

145
00:20:03,086 --> 00:20:05,767
Marco, we should
talk afterwards.

146
00:20:06,087 --> 00:20:09,527
- We've been talking for an hour.
- You have, not me.

147
00:20:10,567 --> 00:20:12,447
Indeed.

148
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:44,411
Did you read about the nuns
that got raped by the misionaries?

149
00:20:46,051 --> 00:20:49,772
Priests, themselves!
It's horrible!

150
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:53,172
Yeah, they've gone bad too!
Where are we heading to?

151
00:20:53,222 --> 00:20:55,652
First they raped the locals.

152
00:20:56,092 --> 00:20:59,373
Then, due to AIDS, they started
raping nuns.

153
00:21:00,293 --> 00:21:02,933
And I admired them so much!

154
00:21:03,293 --> 00:21:05,933
Not all of them are rapists,
for sure.

155
00:21:06,253 --> 00:21:08,974
No, some of them are
pedophiles.

156
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:12,974
- What's that? Everyone loves fucking.
- Antonio, you are an animal!

157
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:17,735
- How do the bulls look?
- Good, but fat.

158
00:21:18,215 --> 00:21:21,295
- How much do you think?
- Over 500 kilos.

159
00:21:22,095 --> 00:21:25,775
I am going to the bar. And don't
forget, we are eating home.

160
00:21:26,095 --> 00:21:29,376
If the kids don't see their aunt,
there'll be hell to pay.

161
00:24:41,797 --> 00:24:44,477
Don't cry, my love.

162
00:24:53,998 --> 00:24:56,878
- How is it?
- Very bad.

163
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:58,678
It tore her apart.

164
00:24:58,758 --> 00:25:01,229
The father will be happy now!

165
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:05,479
'Not the little one!', we kept
telling him, my mother and I.

166
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,720
And yet, she became like him.

167
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:12,960
Don't be upset.

168
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,000
What time is it?

169
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,321
It has been four hours.

170
00:25:19,641 --> 00:25:22,481
AFTER THREE WEEKS

171
00:25:23,801 --> 00:25:25,871
Are you going to Cordoba?

172
00:25:25,921 --> 00:25:29,562
Yes... I would like to stay,
but I can't.

173
00:25:29,642 --> 00:25:33,082
We can't do anything extra.

174
00:25:33,202 --> 00:25:35,552
The bar's been closed for 20 days.

175
00:25:35,602 --> 00:25:39,043
The kids are with the neigbhour,
and I've neglected the other one.

176
00:25:39,323 --> 00:25:42,723
If something happens, can
you be here in 2 hours?

177
00:25:43,163 --> 00:25:47,164
- Rest assured for that.
- We have to have faith.

178
00:25:49,204 --> 00:25:51,794
I light some candles...

179
00:25:51,844 --> 00:25:54,764
...but I find it very
difficult to have faith.

180
00:25:55,445 --> 00:25:58,565
When can we put her medals
back on her?

181
00:25:59,565 --> 00:26:01,395
Not yet.

182
00:26:01,445 --> 00:26:05,566
With all these...
wounds, the tracheotomy...

183
00:26:08,486 --> 00:26:10,686
She never took them off.

184
00:26:24,328 --> 00:26:26,368
I will get a vase.

185
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:48,490
I have to go to the US
for three months.

186
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:52,051
It is very important,
says my agent.

187
00:26:52,371 --> 00:26:56,251
And yet... the way things
stand here...

188
00:26:59,051 --> 00:27:01,492
...I don't want to go.

189
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:17,173
Can you get out for
a moment, please?

190
00:27:26,334 --> 00:27:29,295
No smoking here.

191
00:27:31,815 --> 00:27:34,015
Did she talk to you that day?

192
00:27:35,775 --> 00:27:39,056
- Or rather, I talked.
- And what did you say?

193
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:42,456
Things that concern me.

194
00:27:43,256 --> 00:27:46,086
Did she tell you anything
about me?

195
00:27:46,136 --> 00:27:50,097
Honestly, Lydia hadn't talked
about you for a long time.

196
00:27:50,937 --> 00:27:55,297
- It's my fault for what happened.
- No, it's my fault.

197
00:31:52,483 --> 00:31:55,523
Caetano made me
freak out.

198
00:31:58,764 --> 00:32:02,284
Marco, I've always wanted
to ask you something.

199
00:32:02,524 --> 00:32:06,205
Why did you cry that night,
after you killed the snake?

200
00:32:07,925 --> 00:32:10,325
It brought me lots of memories.

201
00:32:12,005 --> 00:32:15,486
Years ago, I had to
kill another snake.

202
00:32:15,846 --> 00:32:17,966
We were in Africa.

203
00:32:18,406 --> 00:32:21,356
She had the same phobia as you.

204
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:26,447
She was waiting outside the tent,
terrified, defenseless...

205
00:32:27,767 --> 00:32:30,007
...and totally naked...

206
00:32:31,647 --> 00:32:34,928
...because she had seen the snake,
while we were asleep.

207
00:32:35,288 --> 00:32:38,448
Was it the same one who made
you sleep in the living room?

208
00:32:40,768 --> 00:32:43,129
I hate that woman.

209
00:32:43,569 --> 00:32:47,089
- I haven't seen her for years.
- Even worse.

210
00:32:47,139 --> 00:32:50,089
What can I do to make you
forget her?

211
00:32:50,289 --> 00:32:52,650
Exactly what you are doing now.

212
00:33:22,213 --> 00:33:25,973
You were sound asleep. We didn't
want to wake you up.

213
00:33:27,853 --> 00:33:31,454
- Is Dr Vega here?
- He is in his office.

214
00:34:11,818 --> 00:34:14,899
Rosa, close the door.
There's a draft.

215
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:18,779
- She opened her eyes.
- That gives me the creeps!

216
00:34:19,059 --> 00:34:22,099
- And when she yawns?
- I shit myself!

217
00:34:23,939 --> 00:34:27,060
Good morning, doctor.
I want to talk to you.

218
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:29,900
How are you? Did you sleep well?

219
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,380
I will buy you coffee.

220
00:34:34,061 --> 00:34:37,261
How long for might Lydia
stay like that?

221
00:34:37,541 --> 00:34:41,221
Months... years...
maybe for the rest of her life...

222
00:34:42,181 --> 00:34:44,542
There is no hope?

223
00:34:45,942 --> 00:34:49,382
As a doctor, I have to say
no... However...

224
00:34:49,662 --> 00:34:51,622
RESUSCITATION

225
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:55,383
Meryl Moon wakes up after
15 years in a coma.

226
00:34:55,703 --> 00:34:58,773
She went into a coma during
childbirth.

227
00:34:58,823 --> 00:35:03,104
Meryl was a PVS, persistent
vegetative state, like Lydia, for life.

228
00:35:03,944 --> 00:35:07,104
Her recovery contradicts
everything I am about to say.

229
00:35:07,154 --> 00:35:09,024
That is, that there is hope.

230
00:35:09,424 --> 00:35:11,775
I insist. Scientifically, no.

231
00:35:11,825 --> 00:35:14,945
But if you want to have faith,
OK.

232
00:35:15,265 --> 00:35:18,535
Is she opening her eyes?
Or I imagine this?

233
00:35:18,585 --> 00:35:22,986
She does, but that doesn't mean
she is aware of anything.

234
00:35:23,506 --> 00:35:27,386
Her brain cells has been
completely destroyed.

235
00:35:27,906 --> 00:35:32,507
However, it can control
the automatic functions...

236
00:35:32,907 --> 00:35:37,307
such as breathing, sleeping,
waking up and intestinal functions.

237
00:35:37,357 --> 00:35:40,058
She opens her eyes,
but mechanically.

238
00:35:40,108 --> 00:35:43,348
Her brain is dead. She has
no ideas and feelings.

239
00:35:57,670 --> 00:36:00,070
Come in, please.

240
00:36:11,351 --> 00:36:14,351
- My name is Benigno.
- Marco Zuloaga

241
00:36:14,511 --> 00:36:16,592
This is Alicia.

242
00:36:21,352 --> 00:36:23,702
Was it your first night here?

243
00:36:23,752 --> 00:36:26,713
The first one is the worst.
Then you get used to it.

244
00:36:26,763 --> 00:36:28,703
Why these boots?

245
00:36:28,753 --> 00:36:32,153
They prevent her feet from
twisting or falling.

246
00:36:32,593 --> 00:36:36,714
- They look like 'Ibiza' boots.
- I've never been to Ibiza.

247
00:36:37,074 --> 00:36:40,354
- I know you.
- From my books?

248
00:36:41,874 --> 00:36:45,915
It was in Café Muller...
We happened to be sitting together.

249
00:36:48,235 --> 00:36:52,236
And at some stage,
you started crying.

250
00:36:54,596 --> 00:36:58,716
I told you about him.
He cried watching "Café Muller".

251
00:37:00,316 --> 00:37:02,317
I have to go.

252
00:37:03,557 --> 00:37:06,677
That fast?
We barely talked.

253
00:37:06,877 --> 00:37:09,917
- Maybe another time.
- Will you come in the afternoon?

254
00:37:10,277 --> 00:37:13,798
Come to see us. I am always here,
even during the night.

255
00:37:14,158 --> 00:37:17,158
I am a 'veteran' here.
If you need something...

256
00:37:40,441 --> 00:37:44,321
- Should I call Dr Vega;
- Carry on with what you are doing.

257
00:37:57,523 --> 00:38:01,683
The other day, while browsing
my notes...

258
00:38:02,643 --> 00:38:07,404
...I found some
from your visit.

259
00:38:07,884 --> 00:38:12,204
I wrote a topic to be discussed
during the second visit...

260
00:38:12,484 --> 00:38:14,804
...that never took place.

261
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:18,565
- What about?
- Your sexual orientation.

262
00:38:20,445 --> 00:38:24,766
- My sexual orientation?
- Yes, your sexuality.

263
00:38:25,366 --> 00:38:29,046
Whether you like men or women.

264
00:38:31,126 --> 00:38:35,087
During your visit, you said
you were still a virgin.

265
00:38:35,447 --> 00:38:39,247
Answering your question
somehow...

266
00:38:41,127 --> 00:38:44,768
...I think I look for men,
mostly.

267
00:38:46,128 --> 00:38:50,168
- Is this why you came to see me?
- I can't remember now.

268
00:38:51,488 --> 00:38:55,449
I guess that's it...
But I am very well now.

269
00:38:55,569 --> 00:38:57,569
Do you have a partner?

270
00:38:57,809 --> 00:39:03,130
More or less. I am not alone
anymore. I don't have a problem.

271
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:06,650
I hope you were not offended
by my question.

272
00:39:12,291 --> 00:39:14,371
Was her father here?

273
00:39:15,451 --> 00:39:17,811
He asked me if I am a fag.

274
00:39:18,371 --> 00:39:21,452
He used an american expression,
more subtle.

275
00:39:21,532 --> 00:39:24,572
- What is my orientation?
- And what did you say?

276
00:39:24,622 --> 00:39:27,172
- That I like men.
- Really?

277
00:39:27,732 --> 00:39:30,213
No, you fool. I lied.

278
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:33,813
How can he dare ask whether
I like men or women?

279
00:39:34,053 --> 00:39:37,053
- What does he care?
- I am glad I found out.

280
00:39:37,413 --> 00:39:42,174
Did he ask the head nurse or you
if you like bestiality or coprophagy?

281
00:39:42,494 --> 00:39:46,134
No, you are right. They don't
ask such things.

282
00:39:53,495 --> 00:39:58,056
I might go on a trip, and I won't
be able to come and see you.

283
00:39:58,816 --> 00:40:02,576
But, in Geneva, they've
offered me a creation...

284
00:40:02,626 --> 00:40:05,606
...a chorography
that thrills me.

285
00:40:05,656 --> 00:40:09,377
An old idea for a ballet.
I call it 'Trenches'.

286
00:40:09,457 --> 00:40:12,537
It is about the first
world war.

287
00:40:12,817 --> 00:40:15,417
I will need a lot of dancers...

288
00:40:15,497 --> 00:40:19,418
...because in the war there
are a lot of soldiers.

289
00:40:19,738 --> 00:40:24,258
But everyone dances in Geneva.
It is great.

290
00:40:24,658 --> 00:40:29,179
I want female dancers too, because
the soldier when dying...

291
00:40:29,229 --> 00:40:33,019
...lets his soul
get out of his body...

292
00:40:33,299 --> 00:40:36,980
...the ghost of which
will be a female dancer.

293
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:41,020
With a white classic skirt
like 'Giselle'...

294
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:44,781
...but with red stains of blood.

295
00:40:44,831 --> 00:40:46,131
Very good!

296
00:40:46,181 --> 00:40:48,171
Alicia loved it.

297
00:40:48,221 --> 00:40:52,261
It's good because life emerges
out of death.

298
00:40:52,982 --> 00:40:56,182
the female emerges from
the male.

299
00:40:56,702 --> 00:40:59,502
And from the earthly emerges the...

300
00:41:02,703 --> 00:41:05,303
The beach?

301
00:41:06,943 --> 00:41:09,743
And from the earthly emerges the...

302
00:41:10,263 --> 00:41:12,264
The water?

303
00:41:13,064 --> 00:41:14,984
The ethereal.

304
00:41:15,584 --> 00:41:19,104
The ethereal...
the imperceptible, the spirit.

305
00:41:20,024 --> 00:41:24,065
I have the music. It is from
Kristof Penderesky.

306
00:41:24,625 --> 00:41:28,305
It was written for the victims
of Hiroshima, but it's OK.

307
00:41:28,545 --> 00:41:31,506
Of course. Alicia remembers
it perfectly well.

308
00:41:31,866 --> 00:41:35,986
It's music for the battle.
It's wild and beastly.

309
00:41:36,306 --> 00:41:40,027
And regarding the music during deaths
I have a masterpiece...

310
00:41:40,077 --> 00:41:43,467
...which you will listen to,
right now.

311
00:41:45,787 --> 00:41:48,308
It will drive you crazy.

312
00:41:54,588 --> 00:41:56,948
Alicia, my dear.

313
00:41:57,388 --> 00:41:59,829
Good bye, my dear.

314
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:11,830
Good bye, Katerina.
And you look beautiful.

315
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:15,190
- You should go ahead with 'Trenches'.
- I will.

316
00:42:29,232 --> 00:42:32,552
Look... We will place you
next to the window.

317
00:42:33,872 --> 00:42:37,233
You will be able to see your
friends dancing.

318
00:42:42,713 --> 00:42:44,714
I love this room.

319
00:42:45,874 --> 00:42:47,994
I will order everything.

320
00:42:53,835 --> 00:42:56,755
Come in and shut the door...

321
00:43:02,516 --> 00:43:05,196
How are you?... Sit down.

322
00:43:05,676 --> 00:43:08,106
Alicia, look who's here.

323
00:43:08,156 --> 00:43:10,996
We're just getting some air,
reading magazines...

324
00:43:12,877 --> 00:43:15,957
Who was the lady that just left?

325
00:43:16,007 --> 00:43:18,677
Katerina, Alicia's teacher.

326
00:43:19,717 --> 00:43:22,198
Dancing teacher.

327
00:43:22,718 --> 00:43:24,718
Nice character, Katerina.

328
00:43:24,798 --> 00:43:28,198
She has a dancing school somewhere
here. Alicia was her student.

329
00:43:28,438 --> 00:43:31,519
And Katerina loves her like
her daughter.

330
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,320
FOUR YEARS AGO

331
00:44:14,043 --> 00:44:17,244
Benigno, you have been standing
at the window for half an hour.

332
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:19,404
I am coming, mother.

333
00:45:06,409 --> 00:45:08,569
What's the matter? Are you
following me?

334
00:45:12,730 --> 00:45:16,690
This is yours, I think.
It must have dropped you.

335
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:22,451
Is everything there?...
I didn't touch anything...

336
00:45:24,251 --> 00:45:26,921
- Where are you going?
- Home.

337
00:45:26,971 --> 00:45:30,281
Can I accompany you?
I have nothing else to do.

338
00:45:30,331 --> 00:45:34,412
- Yes, but I am going home.
- Of course... It will do me good.

339
00:45:34,652 --> 00:45:37,812
Dancing is my life.
I love dancing shows.

340
00:45:37,862 --> 00:45:40,973
- Do you like dancing?
- Yes, of course

341
00:45:41,023 --> 00:45:43,243
But I don't follow it.

342
00:45:43,293 --> 00:45:45,933
What else do you do,
besides dancing?

343
00:45:45,983 --> 00:45:49,734
I travel and watch old movies.

344
00:45:50,054 --> 00:45:53,894
Silent Cinema is attractive
to me, in particular.

345
00:45:55,654 --> 00:45:58,535
- Where do you go when you go out?
- I don't.

346
00:45:58,615 --> 00:46:00,645
You should go out.

347
00:46:00,695 --> 00:46:03,975
I was taking care of my mother,
but she passed away 2 months ago.

348
00:46:04,255 --> 00:46:07,776
I am sorry. Mine died too,
years ago though.

349
00:46:09,176 --> 00:46:12,776
Here we are...
Thanks for the wallet.

350
00:46:39,979 --> 00:46:43,299
Dr Roncero, psychiatrist.
7th left.

351
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:48,380
Twenty three.

352
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:53,901
I was waiting for her by the window,
but that day she didn't come.

353
00:46:54,621 --> 00:46:58,581
But I knew her address and that
her father was a psychiatrist.

354
00:47:06,382 --> 00:47:08,742
Dr Roncero's office.

355
00:47:09,422 --> 00:47:12,423
I would like to make an
appointment.

356
00:47:12,943 --> 00:47:16,383
- Is it tomorrow at 5 OK?
- Isn't earlier possible?

357
00:47:16,663 --> 00:47:18,863
No, tomorrow at 5.

358
00:47:19,143 --> 00:47:21,063
Your name?

359
00:47:37,505 --> 00:47:41,306
- What do you want?
- I have an appointment at 5.

360
00:47:50,067 --> 00:47:52,587
Come in. Don't stand there.

361
00:47:58,828 --> 00:48:02,468
Benigno Martin?...
I need some information.

362
00:48:04,348 --> 00:48:08,509
<i>I just wanted to see Alicia,
but I was there, at a psychiatrist.</i>

363
00:48:08,829 --> 00:48:11,749
<i>I decided to tell him I missed
my mother.</i>

364
00:48:14,229 --> 00:48:17,350
I started when I was little.

365
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:22,030
And all those 15 years
you took care of your mother?

366
00:48:22,990 --> 00:48:27,391
I was always next to her...
I was studying to be a nurse.

367
00:48:27,791 --> 00:48:31,071
I was only going out to the
classes.

368
00:48:31,151 --> 00:48:35,311
I was also studying aesthetics,
make-up and hairdressing.

369
00:48:35,361 --> 00:48:37,752
But those by post.

370
00:48:38,032 --> 00:48:41,632
So you did those on your mother?

371
00:48:42,032 --> 00:48:45,553
Of course, and I cut her hair,
dyed it, did her nails.

372
00:48:45,603 --> 00:48:48,593
And I scrubbed her down well,
front and back.

373
00:48:48,993 --> 00:48:52,113
My mother wasn't disabled, or mad.

374
00:48:52,273 --> 00:48:54,714
She was only a bit lazy.

375
00:48:55,674 --> 00:48:59,434
She was a beautiful woman
and I didn't want to let herself go.

376
00:49:00,074 --> 00:49:03,515
- What did your father say?
- Nothing. What could he?

377
00:49:03,755 --> 00:49:06,635
- Is he dead?
- God, no.

378
00:49:07,035 --> 00:49:11,715
He is in Sweden, I guess.
I haven't heard from him for years.

379
00:49:12,035 --> 00:49:14,476
Doesn't he come to see you?

380
00:49:15,516 --> 00:49:19,796
He has his own family there,
after he left my mother.

381
00:49:22,317 --> 00:49:24,957
We are not in touch.

382
00:49:25,237 --> 00:49:28,277
Why did you come to see me,
Benigno?

383
00:49:29,517 --> 00:49:32,508
- What's your problem?
- Me? Nothing.

384
00:49:32,558 --> 00:49:36,678
You must have since you came
to see a psychiatrist.

385
00:49:39,278 --> 00:49:41,839
Loneliness, I guess.

386
00:49:44,479 --> 00:49:47,679
Have you had a sexual
relationship with a woman?

387
00:49:49,479 --> 00:49:52,320
- With a man?
- No, neither.

388
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:57,400
I will see you in a week.

389
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:01,301
- Am I not well doctor?
- That's not it...

390
00:50:01,351 --> 00:50:04,876
However, your adolescence was
kind of special.

391
00:50:04,926 --> 00:50:08,402
- It wasn't special.
- It was. Very special.

392
00:50:09,762 --> 00:50:12,602
And we must analyse it in depth.

393
00:50:12,652 --> 00:50:14,722
Yes, lets analyse it.

394
00:50:19,443 --> 00:50:22,563
- Should I come in a week?
- Very well.

395
00:50:23,283 --> 00:50:25,363
I am glad.

396
00:51:54,093 --> 00:51:57,813
- What are you doing here?
- I was just going. Don't be angry.

397
00:51:58,293 --> 00:52:02,334
I just wanted to see you...
But I am harmless.

398
00:52:18,696 --> 00:52:22,336
Dr Roncero's office...
Hi, Lola...

399
00:52:22,696 --> 00:52:26,536
I just had a shit of
huge dimensions.

400
00:53:12,741 --> 00:53:15,382
Can you be in charge?

401
00:53:30,983 --> 00:53:34,984
Alicia never came back. I
didn't want to scare her again.

402
00:53:35,344 --> 00:53:38,984
After a week I went to her
place, to see her father.

403
00:53:39,864 --> 00:53:42,545
It was raining during that
whole week.

404
00:53:48,785 --> 00:53:51,746
Next time I saw her was here.

405
00:53:51,796 --> 00:53:53,466
What happened to her?

406
00:53:53,546 --> 00:53:56,626
A car accident,
during a rainy day.

407
00:53:57,946 --> 00:54:01,947
Her father didn't want her to
be alone, not even for a moment.

408
00:54:02,027 --> 00:54:04,547
He asked for the best nurses.

409
00:54:04,707 --> 00:54:09,308
And I have a good reputation here...
So they suggested me...

410
00:54:09,708 --> 00:54:14,628
And when he saw me, he remembered
me, and hesitated for a moment.

411
00:54:15,028 --> 00:54:18,589
But in the end, he took
Matilde and me, exclusively.

412
00:54:18,869 --> 00:54:22,629
And this was four years ago...
And here we are now...

413
00:54:22,869 --> 00:54:24,549
Right, Alicia?

414
00:54:28,910 --> 00:54:32,270
I started going to the ballet,
when I had a day-off.

415
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:35,870
And to the film library to watch
silent movies.

416
00:54:36,030 --> 00:54:39,351
German, American, Italian
films, everything.

417
00:54:39,631 --> 00:54:42,671
And afterwards I would tell her
about all that she had seen.

418
00:54:43,831 --> 00:54:47,272
The four most complete years
of my life.

419
00:54:47,322 --> 00:54:49,422
I take care of Alicia...

420
00:54:49,472 --> 00:54:53,232
I do what she would, except
the trips, of course.

421
00:54:53,472 --> 00:54:56,473
With me and Lydia
it's the opposite.

422
00:54:58,473 --> 00:55:00,793
I can't touch her.

423
00:55:03,113 --> 00:55:05,994
I don't recognize her body.

424
00:55:06,154 --> 00:55:10,074
Neither can I help the nurses
turn her around.

425
00:55:10,754 --> 00:55:13,745
And I feel I am lousy.

426
00:55:13,795 --> 00:55:16,705
Talk to her. Tell her that.

427
00:55:16,755 --> 00:55:19,075
I would like to,
but she can't hear me.

428
00:55:19,315 --> 00:55:21,915
How are you so certain
about this?

429
00:55:21,995 --> 00:55:25,116
Her brain is dead, Benigno.

430
00:55:25,476 --> 00:55:29,316
The woman's mind is a mystery,
especially in such sickness.

431
00:55:29,756 --> 00:55:33,517
You must look after the woman,
talk to her...

432
00:55:33,637 --> 00:55:37,557
...don't forget that she's alive
and that you love her.

433
00:55:37,607 --> 00:55:41,678
This is the only therapy.
I know from experience.

434
00:55:43,198 --> 00:55:46,158
And what do you know
about women?

435
00:55:46,638 --> 00:55:50,479
Benigno, what do you know
about women?

436
00:55:54,759 --> 00:55:57,829
What do you know about women?

437
00:55:57,879 --> 00:56:02,400
A lot. 20 years next to one,
4 with another.

438
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:08,320
I like the bullfighter's boyfriend.
He has style.

439
00:56:08,370 --> 00:56:11,231
How do you know? You saw him?

440
00:56:11,281 --> 00:56:15,401
Of course not, but I can tell
from his face.

441
00:56:15,801 --> 00:56:18,682
And his bulging trousers.

442
00:56:21,562 --> 00:56:24,202
He is a good friend of
Benigno, right;

443
00:56:25,962 --> 00:56:30,563
- Is he gay too?
- No way. What are you saying now?

444
00:56:30,843 --> 00:56:34,723
- Is Benigno, you think?
- Rumours say so!

445
00:56:35,043 --> 00:56:38,544
- You are wrong.
- Dr Vega told me so as well.

446
00:56:38,594 --> 00:56:41,959
- And where did he find out?
- From Alicia's father.

447
00:56:42,009 --> 00:56:45,466
I don't like the intimacy
he has with the patient...

448
00:56:45,516 --> 00:56:48,925
...but Vega told me not to
worry, because he is gay.

449
00:56:49,685 --> 00:56:53,365
I am going and I'll let you
carry on talking crap about him.

450
00:56:57,366 --> 00:57:01,006
- She likes Benigno.
- She is not in her senses.

451
00:57:07,047 --> 00:57:10,087
I have the day off.
I am going to the film library.

452
00:57:10,137 --> 00:57:13,127
- Are you coming?
- I will see my publisher tonight.

453
00:57:13,177 --> 00:57:15,968
I have to go back to work soon.

454
00:57:16,768 --> 00:57:19,488
This woman is not well.

455
00:57:20,688 --> 00:57:25,049
You know what I mean.
Her skin is dry.

456
00:57:25,729 --> 00:57:28,449
Let's see... Here...

457
00:57:32,049 --> 00:57:35,570
- Did you talk to her?
- No, and don't insist.

458
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:44,491
Hi, Lydia. You must be
patient with him.

459
00:57:47,931 --> 00:57:49,931
Have a good time at work.

460
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:06,253
'Shrinked lover'.

461
00:58:18,334 --> 00:58:22,295
Rosa has the flu.
I hope you didn't get it from her.

462
00:58:25,215 --> 00:58:28,936
I am glad you feel well,
but I will massage you...

463
00:58:28,986 --> 00:58:32,016
...and I will rub you with
a rosemary lotion.

464
00:58:54,898 --> 00:58:57,899
No, nothing is happening to me.

465
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:04,379
Last night I saw a movie that
shook me a lot.

466
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:09,770
It was the love story...

467
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:14,181
...of Alfredo, a nice young
guy, but a bit fat...

468
00:59:14,981 --> 00:59:18,661
...and a friend of Amparo,
who is a scientist.

469
00:59:19,381 --> 00:59:22,461
Amparo prepares a new
experimental diet...

470
00:59:22,781 --> 00:59:25,782
...that will revolutionize
the food industry.

471
00:59:27,142 --> 00:59:29,662
What egoism! You only
think of yourself!

472
00:59:55,905 --> 00:59:57,505
I found it!

473
01:00:04,826 --> 01:00:08,986
It might be dangerous. I never
gave it to a human before.

474
01:00:17,107 --> 01:00:19,548
You still think I act
with selfishness?

475
01:00:50,711 --> 01:00:52,991
It has done miracles for you!

476
01:01:04,352 --> 01:01:07,913
Don't worry, my love!
I will find the antidote!

477
01:01:15,754 --> 01:01:17,744
Time was passing by...

478
01:01:17,794 --> 01:01:20,754
...but Amparo couldn't find
the antidote...

479
01:01:21,074 --> 01:01:24,475
...and poor Alfredo,
day by day, shrank in misery.

480
01:01:29,075 --> 01:01:31,555
I will always love you.

481
01:01:32,715 --> 01:01:35,226
So that Amparo doesn't suffer...

482
01:01:35,276 --> 01:01:38,996
...Alfredo leaves and goes
to find his mother.

483
01:01:39,116 --> 01:01:42,277
He hadn't seen her for 10 years,
beacause he was lousy.

484
01:01:42,757 --> 01:01:46,357
He hadn't told Ambaro
where his mother lived.

485
01:01:46,637 --> 01:01:50,037
Lots of things going on
in this movie.

486
01:01:50,477 --> 01:01:53,238
But the most important
thing is...

487
01:01:53,878 --> 01:01:58,158
...after years full of
regrets and studies...

488
01:01:59,318 --> 01:02:03,559
...Amparo finds the address
of his mother.

489
01:02:05,639 --> 01:02:08,199
And goes there.

490
01:02:52,524 --> 01:02:55,684
Hotel Yukali.
Room 15.

491
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:25,648
- Sleep, my darling.
- And what if I be a burden by mistake?

492
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:53,424
And Alfredo...

493
01:05:55,824 --> 01:05:58,664
...stays inside her...

494
01:06:01,345 --> 01:06:03,705
...for ever.

495
01:06:24,067 --> 01:06:28,107
AFTER ONE MONTH

496
01:06:29,148 --> 01:06:33,148
Come on, put your hands
correctly... This way...

497
01:06:38,709 --> 01:06:41,829
It's quite cool...
It's great...

498
01:06:42,229 --> 01:06:45,229
It's nice here by
the balcony, right?

499
01:06:45,469 --> 01:06:48,550
Lydia likes to sit by
the balcony as well.

500
01:06:49,310 --> 01:06:51,830
Did you hear that?
She likes it a lot.

501
01:06:52,510 --> 01:06:56,630
Look at them... It's as if
they are talking about us.

502
01:06:58,711 --> 01:07:01,031
What do you think they say?

503
01:07:01,751 --> 01:07:04,261
They have no shame.

504
01:07:04,311 --> 01:07:07,672
Women talk about everything
with each other.

505
01:07:08,952 --> 01:07:12,912
Lydia would tell her she has
completed two months of sickness.

506
01:07:48,356 --> 01:07:50,626
Benjamin and Angela...

507
01:07:50,676 --> 01:07:54,797
...will you bond in marriage,
with your own will?

508
01:07:57,917 --> 01:08:01,558
Join your hands together...

509
01:08:01,918 --> 01:08:06,038
...and declare your wish
in front of God.

510
01:08:10,278 --> 01:08:13,279
I, Angela,
take you, Benjamin...

511
01:08:13,759 --> 01:08:16,919
...to be my lawful husband...

512
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:20,920
I will love you
in happiness and in sickness...

513
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:25,480
...so long as we shall both live.

514
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:29,921
The Lord that joined you in love...

515
01:08:30,201 --> 01:08:34,401
...let him accept your declaration
of love today.

516
01:08:34,801 --> 01:08:38,482
May your love last eternally.

517
01:08:39,042 --> 01:08:42,282
What are you doing here? We
were gonna meet at the hotel.

518
01:08:42,362 --> 01:08:46,402
I changed my mind.
I've always liked weddings.

519
01:08:46,682 --> 01:08:49,963
Weren't you gonna see
your sister before the game?

520
01:08:50,203 --> 01:08:53,113
I called her.
She will come to the hotel.

521
01:08:53,163 --> 01:08:56,363
I promised her we will eat at
the restaurant tonight.

522
01:08:56,413 --> 01:08:58,284
As you wish.

523
01:09:03,044 --> 01:09:06,805
- Nice ceremony, right?
- Excellent.

524
01:09:09,885 --> 01:09:13,885
- I didn't expect her so young.
- You don't trust me right?

525
01:09:14,805 --> 01:09:18,166
We can't have another day
passing by without talking.

526
01:09:18,526 --> 01:09:22,646
Don't worry. Finish with Angela,
I have proof.

527
01:09:23,206 --> 01:09:27,087
For example, at the ceremony
I didn't cry, you did.

528
01:09:27,137 --> 01:09:29,927
- Right.
- And you shouldn't have.

529
01:09:30,087 --> 01:09:32,127
Don't you believe me?

530
01:09:32,407 --> 01:09:36,568
I needed 10 years to get over
it. I finally made it.

531
01:09:38,728 --> 01:09:41,728
Lydia, trust me,
it's over.

532
01:09:42,448 --> 01:09:44,839
I travelled with Angela.

533
01:09:44,889 --> 01:09:48,409
The excuse was to write
a travel guide.

534
01:09:48,769 --> 01:09:53,130
In reality, I wanted her
out of Madrid and drugs.

535
01:09:53,530 --> 01:09:57,770
Madrid is hell. Our relationship
functioned outside it.

536
01:09:58,530 --> 01:10:02,131
After five trips,
I brought her to her parents...

537
01:10:02,181 --> 01:10:06,211
...who kept her away
from drugs and from me.

538
01:10:06,811 --> 01:10:08,851
Did you still love her?

539
01:10:10,451 --> 01:10:14,452
I cried not being able to share
things with her.

540
01:10:15,452 --> 01:10:19,412
It's terrible to leave
a person you love so much.

541
01:10:20,092 --> 01:10:22,293
What a sad story!

542
01:10:22,893 --> 01:10:26,373
Love is a sad thing when
it ends...

543
01:10:26,423 --> 01:10:28,813
...as the song says.

544
01:10:29,173 --> 01:10:31,814
Marco, we need to talk afterwards.

545
01:10:32,094 --> 01:10:35,974
- We've been talking for an hour.
- You have, not me.

546
01:10:36,694 --> 01:10:38,654
You're right.

547
01:11:04,097 --> 01:11:07,298
My leg needs two months of therapy,
said the doctor.

548
01:11:07,618 --> 01:11:10,578
But you know what? I am glad
that bull hit me.

549
01:11:11,018 --> 01:11:14,258
Now I can stay with you until
you wake up.

550
01:11:14,308 --> 01:11:16,699
No one will take me away from you.

551
01:11:18,339 --> 01:11:21,579
We got back together,
a month ago...

552
01:11:22,899 --> 01:11:26,700
Lydia would tell you at the
wedding. She didn't in the end.

553
01:11:29,420 --> 01:11:32,140
It was you she cried for.

554
01:11:34,341 --> 01:11:38,701
She called me to tell me
she cried for me.

555
01:11:40,101 --> 01:11:42,811
Last time we spoke.

556
01:11:42,861 --> 01:11:46,222
Now that I don't fight
due to injury...

557
01:11:46,342 --> 01:11:49,382
...I would like to stay
near her during the night.

558
01:11:49,432 --> 01:11:51,662
Like at your place.

559
01:12:27,946 --> 01:12:30,347
I am alone again.

560
01:12:34,467 --> 01:12:36,937
You were looking at her breasts.

561
01:12:36,987 --> 01:12:40,068
Difficult to avoid it.
They grow by the day.

562
01:12:40,388 --> 01:12:44,868
Benigno, I am thinking of taking
a trip... I have to work.

563
01:12:45,308 --> 01:12:47,348
And Lydia?

564
01:12:47,868 --> 01:12:50,269
She doesn't need me anymore.

565
01:12:52,189 --> 01:12:54,189
Did you break up?

566
01:12:55,109 --> 01:12:57,980
You can call it that.

567
01:12:58,030 --> 01:13:01,990
I expected this, Marco.
Don't ask why, I just did.

568
01:13:03,510 --> 01:13:08,031
There was something in your
relationship that didn't function right.

569
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:10,341
When are you going?

570
01:13:10,391 --> 01:13:13,271
Soon, but I'll see you before
I go.

571
01:13:13,551 --> 01:13:15,911
I am so sorry you are going.

572
01:13:20,672 --> 01:13:23,632
I am leaving, Benigno.
I'll see you soon.

573
01:13:25,913 --> 01:13:29,473
She didn't have her period yet?

574
01:13:30,913 --> 01:13:34,874
I am looking at the month's report.
She should have had it.

575
01:13:36,194 --> 01:13:38,554
Yes, it's a bit late.

576
01:13:50,315 --> 01:13:54,196
Two weeks. That's a lot.
Are you sure she had it last month?

577
01:13:54,836 --> 01:13:58,956
I personally dealt with it.
It was when you had the flu.

578
01:14:00,116 --> 01:14:02,397
She seems a bit swollen.

579
01:14:02,797 --> 01:14:05,187
They often have abnormalities.

580
01:14:05,237 --> 01:14:08,517
For example, Lydia
doesn't have a period anymore.

581
01:14:08,997 --> 01:14:12,598
Anyway, we should tell Dr Vega.

582
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:34,040
I brought some of my guides
for Alicia and you.

583
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:38,040
I said goodbye to Lydia.

584
01:14:39,561 --> 01:14:43,761
I went to see Alicia, but they
didn't let me enter the room.

585
01:14:45,681 --> 01:14:47,841
Is there something wrong?

586
01:14:48,241 --> 01:14:51,202
No. Just some infection
that Alicia got.

587
01:14:51,402 --> 01:14:54,422
Can you drive me home?
I am done with work.

588
01:14:54,472 --> 01:14:57,392
- It's not serious, I hope.
- I don't know.

589
01:14:57,442 --> 01:15:01,363
They do some medical examinations,
but they haven't told me anything.

590
01:15:02,363 --> 01:15:05,353
Brazil...

591
01:15:05,403 --> 01:15:07,644
...Turkey, Cuba.

592
01:15:08,484 --> 01:15:11,564
- I will read them to Alicia.
- They are guides.

593
01:15:12,004 --> 01:15:14,794
Yours. They must be good.

594
01:15:14,844 --> 01:15:17,365
- Are you travelling alone?
- Yes.

595
01:15:17,645 --> 01:15:20,685
I would like to talk to you
about this before you go.

596
01:15:21,005 --> 01:15:24,165
- About what?
- Loneliness.

597
01:15:24,325 --> 01:15:26,606
I want to get married.

598
01:15:29,126 --> 01:15:32,166
- Alicia, of course!
- Benigno, you are nuts!

599
01:15:32,216 --> 01:15:35,157
We will get along better than
most couples.

600
01:15:35,207 --> 01:15:38,447
- Why shouldn't I marry her?
- Because she is in a coma!

601
01:15:40,127 --> 01:15:43,687
Because she can't say 'yes'
in the church!

602
01:15:44,087 --> 01:15:47,648
Because, she is virtually dead!

603
01:15:47,698 --> 01:15:49,438
Get in the car!

604
01:15:49,488 --> 01:15:51,928
- What are you talking about?
- Get in the car!

605
01:15:57,929 --> 01:16:01,369
Your relationship with Alicia
is a crazy monologue!

606
01:16:01,649 --> 01:16:05,170
We often talk to PVS,
but we don't marry them.

607
01:16:05,730 --> 01:16:09,570
Incredible what you are saying.
I had a different opinion of you.

608
01:16:09,850 --> 01:16:13,371
Don't say or think about it
ever again!

609
01:16:13,931 --> 01:16:18,531
Promise!... If you say that to
anyone else, you will be in trouble!

610
01:16:20,611 --> 01:16:23,572
If that calms you down,
then I promise.

611
01:16:23,812 --> 01:16:26,852
- Regardless of how much you like her...
- You like her too, right?

612
01:16:26,902 --> 01:16:28,932
Of course I like her.

613
01:16:29,492 --> 01:16:33,273
- She likes you too.
- She is virtually dead!

614
01:16:33,323 --> 01:16:37,053
She has no feelings about me,
you, or herself!

615
01:16:37,103 --> 01:16:39,573
Understand that!

616
01:16:44,574 --> 01:16:48,114
Our patient Alicia Roncero
was raped and is pregnant.

617
01:16:48,164 --> 01:16:51,655
Before I tell her father
I want you to tell me...

618
01:16:51,705 --> 01:16:54,695
...which bastard did it!

619
01:16:54,745 --> 01:16:57,005
Everyone is upset.

620
01:16:57,055 --> 01:17:00,736
You are responsible. Alicia
was on your floor.

621
01:17:01,016 --> 01:17:04,176
Then allow me to explain the
situation.

622
01:17:04,776 --> 01:17:06,976
Rosa, please.

623
01:17:08,137 --> 01:17:11,897
Alicia's period stopped
two months ago.

624
01:17:12,257 --> 01:17:16,257
I thought it was one month
initially, but I was wrong.

625
01:17:16,457 --> 01:17:19,498
It wasn't in last month's report.

626
01:17:19,698 --> 01:17:22,698
It says it was dealt with normally.

627
01:17:22,938 --> 01:17:26,139
I was down with flu
during that week.

628
01:17:27,099 --> 01:17:30,059
You wrote that.
Right, Benigno?

629
01:17:30,299 --> 01:17:33,339
- It is your typewriting.
- Yes, it was me.

630
01:17:33,539 --> 01:17:36,380
Why did you lie?

631
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:39,290
I didn't want it to become a problem.

632
01:17:39,340 --> 01:17:42,780
On other occasions, the patients'
periods have also stopped.

633
01:17:44,020 --> 01:17:47,981
How come no one noticed?
Where is the night person?

634
01:17:48,181 --> 01:17:51,381
She can't come today.
She phoned.

635
01:17:51,461 --> 01:17:53,571
Didn't see notice anything strange?

636
01:17:53,621 --> 01:17:57,822
She has problems at home.
A lot of nights she doesn't come.

637
01:17:58,062 --> 01:18:00,622
And who replaces her?

638
01:18:04,143 --> 01:18:07,183
I will tell Roncero
that his daughter...

639
01:18:07,543 --> 01:18:10,343
...is day and night with
a nutcase?

640
01:18:10,423 --> 01:18:12,584
Lets calm down for a bit.

641
01:18:14,224 --> 01:18:19,264
Benigno, do you realise you
are the prime suspect?

642
01:18:20,144 --> 01:18:23,175
Why did you hide the first delay?

643
01:18:23,225 --> 01:18:27,425
What explanation do you have?
Would you ever harm Alicia?

644
01:18:27,665 --> 01:18:29,545
Definitely not!

645
01:18:34,946 --> 01:18:37,656
Last night I was
at the parking lot...

646
01:18:37,706 --> 01:18:41,507
...and overheard a discussion
between Benigno and Marco.

647
01:18:41,627 --> 01:18:44,987
Benigno said he wanted to
marry Alicia.

648
01:18:45,387 --> 01:18:49,187
Marco tried to change his mind,
but in vain.

649
01:18:51,988 --> 01:18:54,298
Lots of couples, he said...

650
01:18:54,348 --> 01:18:57,668
...don'r get along
as well as him and Alicia.

651
01:18:59,749 --> 01:19:03,229
JORDANIA, AFTER EIGHT MONTHS

652
01:19:18,951 --> 01:19:22,871
It was Lydia Gonzales' funeral
yesterday, at Almudena.

653
01:19:24,031 --> 01:19:29,272
The thirty-year old bullfighter
was in a coma since...

654
01:19:32,312 --> 01:19:34,812
Can I speak with
Benigno Martin?

655
01:19:34,862 --> 01:19:37,313
He doesn't work here anymore.

656
01:19:38,393 --> 01:19:40,633
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

657
01:19:40,993 --> 01:19:43,513
- And sister Rosa Lazaga;
- Who are you?

658
01:19:43,563 --> 01:19:46,034
- Marco Zuloaga.
- I will put you through.

659
01:19:50,354 --> 01:19:53,314
- Who is it?
- Marco Zuloaga.

660
01:19:54,195 --> 01:19:57,235
I am calling from Jordan.
I found out about Lydia.

661
01:19:57,285 --> 01:19:59,675
I am sorry, Marco.

662
01:20:00,315 --> 01:20:02,675
You should have called me.

663
01:20:04,076 --> 01:20:06,476
We had a lot of problems here.

664
01:20:06,716 --> 01:20:09,836
What happened? Benigno isn't
there anymore, I was told.

665
01:20:10,276 --> 01:20:13,317
Benigno is in jail.

666
01:20:16,157 --> 01:20:19,797
He is accused of raping Alicia.

667
01:20:22,238 --> 01:20:25,278
Help him. He has no one
the poor guy.

668
01:20:25,328 --> 01:20:27,268
Did you go see him?

669
01:20:27,318 --> 01:20:30,118
After what he did, I can't.

670
01:20:30,358 --> 01:20:33,519
However he does need help,
and you are his friend.

671
01:20:33,719 --> 01:20:37,079
- What prison is he in?
- In Zegovia.

672
01:21:25,924 --> 01:21:28,445
Wait for me here.

673
01:21:43,246 --> 01:21:46,607
- I want to see a prisoner.
- In the visting section.

674
01:21:46,657 --> 01:21:49,047
Through this door, on the left.

675
01:21:59,888 --> 01:22:02,838
I want prisoner Benigno Martin.

676
01:22:02,888 --> 01:22:05,889
It isn't a visting day,
but I will see whether...

677
01:22:05,939 --> 01:22:08,009
I am sorry, I can't hear you.

678
01:22:09,169 --> 01:22:11,479
It isn't a visiting day.

679
01:22:11,529 --> 01:22:15,330
And the lodger didn't ask
for a visit.

680
01:22:15,810 --> 01:22:18,930
He doesn't know I am in Madrid.
I came today.

681
01:22:19,330 --> 01:22:22,571
- Are you a relative?
- A friend.

682
01:22:22,691 --> 01:22:26,371
- Marco Zuloaga is my name.
- Can I see your I.D.?

683
01:22:29,131 --> 01:22:32,932
- Can I call him?
- He will call you.

684
01:22:33,212 --> 01:22:36,692
I have changed number. Can you
give him the new one?

685
01:22:45,613 --> 01:22:47,603
And remember.

686
01:22:47,653 --> 01:22:50,934
Visiting days are Saturday
and Sunday.

687
01:22:51,254 --> 01:22:55,054
But the lodger should ask for
the visit.

688
01:22:55,334 --> 01:22:58,454
If he doesn't want to see you,
there is nothing we can do.

689
01:22:59,935 --> 01:23:03,895
And something else. We don't
have prisoners here...

690
01:23:04,895 --> 01:23:09,176
We don't have prisoners here,
we have lodgers.

691
01:23:44,619 --> 01:23:46,900
Marco, is that you?

692
01:23:47,780 --> 01:23:51,980
I am glad to hear your voice.
I asked your visit on Saturday.

693
01:23:54,340 --> 01:23:56,581
- Where are you?
- Outside the clinique.

694
01:23:58,661 --> 01:24:02,581
Dr Vega told me everything.
How could you do it?

695
01:24:03,221 --> 01:24:06,342
Did you come back to Spain
to get on my back?

696
01:24:07,622 --> 01:24:10,582
Do you need anything?
What should I bring you on Saturday?

697
01:24:10,662 --> 01:24:14,183
I need information.
What do you know about Alicia?

698
01:24:14,233 --> 01:24:16,423
They wouldn't say anything
from the clinique.

699
01:24:16,743 --> 01:24:18,863
She is in a different one.
They don't know where.

700
01:24:18,983 --> 01:24:21,763
- I don't believe this.
- Neither do I.

701
01:24:21,813 --> 01:24:24,544
But I am not surpised they
won't tell us.

702
01:24:24,824 --> 01:24:28,264
- Are you still my friend?
- Of course. Since I am here.

703
01:24:28,464 --> 01:24:30,664
Then find out about Alicia.

704
01:24:31,064 --> 01:24:34,345
Whether she's alive, whether she gave
birth, whether the baby is alive...

705
01:24:34,545 --> 01:24:38,225
I need to know, Marco...
You understand, right?

706
01:24:40,665 --> 01:24:45,106
I will try to...
Talk to you on Saturday...

707
01:24:47,106 --> 01:24:50,627
- Did you find out anything?
- I will. Be patient.

708
01:24:50,947 --> 01:24:56,067
I was, until the day she would
give birth. One month ago.

709
01:24:56,747 --> 01:24:59,027
You must wait.

710
01:25:04,988 --> 01:25:09,189
- What do you do during the day here?
- I work in the recovery room.

711
01:25:09,909 --> 01:25:14,349
It's a new prison, few people.
It's quiet in here.

712
01:25:14,949 --> 01:25:18,310
- It doesn't look like a prison from outside.
- The problem is elsewhere!

713
01:25:18,750 --> 01:25:21,630
That I don't see Alicia.

714
01:25:22,310 --> 01:25:26,270
The doctor  Dr Roncero
say I am a psychopath.

715
01:25:29,591 --> 01:25:33,391
This is good for the trial, they say,
but I don't care about the trial.

716
01:25:33,791 --> 01:25:37,672
I need to see Alicia,
to find out how everything went.

717
01:25:38,312 --> 01:25:42,352
If this goes on, I don't
know what I am capable of doing!

718
01:25:42,592 --> 01:25:44,752
I am a psychopath, they say?
Then I will act like one!

719
01:25:44,802 --> 01:25:46,673
Don't say that, Benigno!

720
01:25:47,833 --> 01:25:52,033
And find me another lawyer.
The one I have despises me.

721
01:25:54,553 --> 01:25:58,594
I will rent my place so that
I can pay him.

722
01:25:59,034 --> 01:26:02,174
I will rent it.
I am currently homeless.

723
01:26:02,224 --> 01:26:05,315
Great. I am glad you will be
my tenant.

724
01:26:06,075 --> 01:26:09,995
I was thinking about you a lot,
especially during the nights.

725
01:26:10,755 --> 01:26:14,116
- Why during the nights?
- Because I study during the nights.

726
01:26:14,356 --> 01:26:17,036
I read all your guides.

727
01:26:17,196 --> 01:26:20,756
Like travelling with you
next to me...

728
01:26:20,806 --> 01:26:23,157
...telling me things.

729
01:26:23,437 --> 01:26:26,477
I liked Avan's the most.

730
01:26:26,717 --> 01:26:28,957
I became one with those people...

731
01:26:29,037 --> 01:26:32,078
...that have nothing
and invent everything.

732
01:26:33,038 --> 01:26:36,078
And you describing
the Cuban girl...

733
01:26:36,128 --> 01:26:39,118
...in front of her window
by the sea...

734
01:26:39,168 --> 01:26:41,158
...waiting in vain...

735
01:26:41,639 --> 01:26:44,719
...for something that will
never happen.

736
01:26:45,319 --> 01:26:48,279
I was thinking that woman is me.

737
01:27:06,281 --> 01:27:09,442
Good morning. I am Benigno's
friend.

738
01:27:09,962 --> 01:27:12,682
You are Marco, the Argentinian?

739
01:27:13,042 --> 01:27:17,682
Benigno called me.
Will you take his appartment?

740
01:27:18,483 --> 01:27:22,723
It will be dirty. He wouldn't
let me in to clean it.

741
01:27:24,163 --> 01:27:28,124
- And I didn't want any money...
- It's OK, I will take care of it.

742
01:27:28,404 --> 01:27:32,044
Shall I give you the key?...
I will go look for it...

743
01:27:38,525 --> 01:27:40,525
Did you see him?

744
01:27:41,605 --> 01:27:44,365
- How is he?
- Well.

745
01:27:45,565 --> 01:27:49,486
Poor guy, he wasn't even lucky
during his imprisonment.

746
01:27:49,536 --> 01:27:51,636
No publicity!

747
01:27:51,686 --> 01:27:55,807
No TV, no reporters.
No one came here.

748
01:27:56,287 --> 01:27:59,447
They didn't condescend!
And they show such garbage!

749
01:27:59,497 --> 01:28:01,527
I would give them an interview!

750
01:28:01,767 --> 01:28:04,287
The media is shit in this country!

751
01:28:04,447 --> 01:28:06,368
You are right.

752
01:28:06,848 --> 01:28:08,888
The keys...

753
01:28:09,448 --> 01:28:13,849
Anyway... Do you know why
Benigno is in prison?

754
01:28:14,289 --> 01:28:18,409
He is very quiet. He didn't say
a word last time he came.

755
01:28:18,969 --> 01:28:21,929
- Benigno is innocent.
- Yes, I know.

756
01:28:22,169 --> 01:28:25,090
- Innocent about what?
- I don't know.

757
01:28:25,450 --> 01:28:28,570
You do, but you don't want
to tell me.

758
01:28:33,531 --> 01:28:36,931
If you need something,
you know where I am.

759
01:30:30,543 --> 01:30:34,344
I was glad you stepped in
by yourself today, without crutches.

760
01:30:36,784 --> 01:30:39,544
- How did the exercise go today?
- Very well.

761
01:30:39,594 --> 01:30:41,654
- Were you tired?
- A lot.

762
01:30:41,704 --> 01:30:45,185
It doesn't matter. We will
do some extra exercises.

763
01:30:46,425 --> 01:30:49,105
We will do some stretches.

764
01:30:49,425 --> 01:30:53,106
- But I already did 100.
- We'll do a few more.

765
01:31:28,670 --> 01:31:31,350
I have an appointment with
Mr. Sainz.

766
01:31:35,670 --> 01:31:38,511
The boy was born dead.

767
01:31:38,631 --> 01:31:41,771
Alicia recovered.
Benigno hasn't found out.

768
01:31:41,821 --> 01:31:44,911
In his condition,
he could do something crazy.

769
01:31:45,351 --> 01:31:49,032
I can't lie to him.
He is my only friend.

770
01:31:49,512 --> 01:31:52,902
I will tell him.
I have no problem.

771
01:31:52,952 --> 01:31:56,473
Alicia is still in coma and
the baby dead, I will say.

772
01:31:56,673 --> 01:31:59,463
But you don't tell him anything.

773
01:31:59,513 --> 01:32:04,113
- Can he bail out?
- Very difficult, and expensive.

774
01:32:31,636 --> 01:32:34,267
- You are wet.
- A little.

775
01:32:34,317 --> 01:32:38,957
Be careful not to catch a cold.
Drink hot milk with honey.

776
01:32:50,158 --> 01:32:53,919
Since I am here,
I like rainy days.

777
01:32:56,439 --> 01:32:58,999
Dld you see the new lawyer?

778
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:05,720
He was here...
he told me everything...

779
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:11,561
- I will loose, right?
- Frankly, yes, you will.

780
01:33:11,611 --> 01:33:15,081
At least nothing happened to
Alicia during birth.

781
01:33:15,521 --> 01:33:19,642
It's the only thing that consoles
me and gives me hope.

782
01:33:21,362 --> 01:33:23,562
Are you ok, Benigno?

783
01:33:27,322 --> 01:33:30,803
I would like to hug you
so much, Marco.

784
01:33:32,243 --> 01:33:35,803
But I have to ask for a meeting
face to face.

785
01:33:35,853 --> 01:33:37,844
I tried.

786
01:33:39,324 --> 01:33:42,284
They asked me whether you are
my lover.

787
01:33:42,444 --> 01:33:46,484
I didn't dare say 'yes' since
that would annoy you.

788
01:33:46,724 --> 01:33:51,045
It wouldn't annoy me at all.
You can say whatever you want.

789
01:33:51,365 --> 01:33:54,845
I have hugged very few people
in my life.

790
01:34:47,931 --> 01:34:49,771
Message!

791
01:34:53,732 --> 01:34:57,492
I was very happy to see you
and say goodbye today.

792
01:34:58,332 --> 01:35:01,073
They won't let me get
out of here...

793
01:35:01,123 --> 01:35:03,813
...or they will put me
somewhere else

794
01:35:04,093 --> 01:35:06,683
I don't want to live
without Alicia...

795
01:35:06,733 --> 01:35:10,374
...without being able to hold
not one pin of hers.

796
01:35:10,974 --> 01:35:13,294
Therefore I will escape.

797
01:35:13,574 --> 01:35:17,294
I didn't tell you so that you
won't stop me.

798
01:35:17,454 --> 01:35:19,975
I hug you firmly, Marco.

799
01:35:37,096 --> 01:35:40,017
In Zegovia...
Yes, in prison...

800
01:35:59,299 --> 01:36:02,619
I urgently need to see Benigno Martin.

801
01:36:02,899 --> 01:36:05,860
It's a matter of life and death.

802
01:36:06,140 --> 01:36:09,180
The warden is waiting for you
in his office.

803
01:36:09,230 --> 01:36:11,780
Me? Where is his office?

804
01:36:12,220 --> 01:36:14,740
The guard will accompany you.

805
01:36:21,821 --> 01:36:24,382
Empty your pockets, please.

806
01:36:37,463 --> 01:36:39,783
Wait, don't run.

807
01:36:45,704 --> 01:36:47,624
In there at the end.

808
01:36:49,064 --> 01:36:52,145
Good morning. I am
Marco Zuloaga.

809
01:36:52,785 --> 01:36:56,065
Benigno Martin left this
letter for you.

810
01:37:03,266 --> 01:37:05,416
Dear Marco...

811
01:37:05,466 --> 01:37:09,426
It's still raining, and this
is a good sign.

812
01:37:10,747 --> 01:37:14,307
When Alicia had the accident,
it was raining too.

813
01:37:14,787 --> 01:37:18,387
I am writing to you a few
minutes before I escape.

814
01:37:18,437 --> 01:37:21,988
I hope, with all these,
to fall in a coma as well...

815
01:37:22,038 --> 01:37:24,188
...and to be near her.

816
01:37:24,908 --> 01:37:27,388
You are my only friend.

817
01:37:27,828 --> 01:37:31,629
I am leaving you the house
I prepared for me and her.

818
01:37:33,469 --> 01:37:37,789
Wherever they take me, come to
see me and talk to me.

819
01:37:38,350 --> 01:37:42,070
Tell me everything, without
hiding anything.

820
01:37:42,870 --> 01:37:45,070
Goodbye, my friend.

821
01:38:02,272 --> 01:38:06,033
I took these from him and these
I found at his cell.

822
01:38:14,593 --> 01:38:16,874
You must sign here.

823
01:38:25,915 --> 01:38:28,035
Benigno, it's me.

824
01:38:30,475 --> 01:38:34,836
Alicia is alive...
You woke her up.

825
01:38:38,436 --> 01:38:42,596
I got your message and ran
immediately to tell you...

826
01:38:42,836 --> 01:38:45,277
...but it was too late.

827
01:38:45,397 --> 01:38:48,837
I put a pin of Alicia
in your pocket.

828
01:38:50,797 --> 01:38:53,358
And a photo of hers.

829
01:38:54,118 --> 01:38:57,118
And a photo of your mother.

830
01:38:57,958 --> 01:39:01,238
So that they can be with you
in eternity.

831
01:40:22,887 --> 01:40:26,488
Like wild waves. The male on top,
the female below.

832
01:40:26,808 --> 01:40:28,448
I will bring some water.

833
01:40:56,571 --> 01:40:58,491
Are you ok?

834
01:41:01,331 --> 01:41:03,292
I don't know...

835
01:41:05,692 --> 01:41:08,052
I am much better now.

836
01:41:20,814 --> 01:41:23,254
Come on, let's go inside.

837
01:41:28,254 --> 01:41:30,255
You tremble.

838
01:41:31,855 --> 01:41:33,335
Why?

839
01:41:44,256 --> 01:41:46,616
- What did you tell her?
- Nothing.

840
01:41:46,666 --> 01:41:48,567
I saw you talking.

841
01:41:48,617 --> 01:41:51,977
She asked if I am ok, and I
thanked her.

842
01:41:53,817 --> 01:41:58,258
You will see me around.
I live near the dancing school.

843
01:41:58,978 --> 01:42:01,818
In Benigno's place?

844
01:42:02,418 --> 01:42:05,818
- Why do you stay there?
- Benigno is dead.

845
01:42:10,859 --> 01:42:14,019
One day, we should talk.

846
01:42:14,339 --> 01:42:17,780
Yes, and it will be simpler
than you thought.

847
01:42:18,100 --> 01:42:20,100
Nothing is simple.

848
01:42:20,500 --> 01:42:23,580
I am a dancing teacher, and nothing is simple.
and nothing is simple.

849
01:42:24,305 --> 01:43:24,748
Do you want subtitles for any video?
