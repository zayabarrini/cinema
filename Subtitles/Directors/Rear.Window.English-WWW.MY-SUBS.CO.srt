1
00:02:26,485 --> 00:02:28,537
Men, are you over 40?

2
00:02:28,577 --> 00:02:30,619
When you wake up in the morning,
do you feel tired and rundown?

3
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:33,754
Do you have that listless feeling?

4
00:04:10,858 --> 00:04:13,942
Jefferies.
Congratulations, Jeff.

5
00:04:13,981 --> 00:04:16,034
For what?
Getting rid of that cast.

6
00:04:16,075 --> 00:04:18,118
Who said I was getting rid of it?

7
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:20,209
This is Wednesday.

8
00:04:20,249 --> 00:04:23,332
Seven weeks from the day you broke
your leg. Yes or no?

9
00:04:24,423 --> 00:04:27,506
Gunnison, how did you get to be
such a big editor

10
00:04:27,557 --> 00:04:29,599
With such a small memory?

11
00:04:29,638 --> 00:04:31,692
Thrift, industry and hard work...

12
00:04:31,732 --> 00:04:34,815
And catching the publisher
with his secretary.

13
00:04:34,855 --> 00:04:37,948
Did I get the wrong day?
No.

14
00:04:37,989 --> 00:04:38,990
No, wrong week.

15
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:42,123
Next Wednesday I emerge from this...
Plaster cocoon.

16
00:04:44,256 --> 00:04:47,338
That's too bad, Jeff.
Well, I guess I can't be lucky every day.

17
00:04:49,471 --> 00:04:50,472
Forget I called.

18
00:04:50,512 --> 00:04:53,605
Yeach, I sure feel sorry for you, Gunnison.

19
00:04:53,645 --> 00:04:56,738
Must be rough on you thinking of me
wearing this cast for another week.

20
00:04:57,821 --> 00:05:00,914
That one week is gonna cost
me my best photographer,

21
00:05:00,953 --> 00:05:02,995
And you a big assignment.

22
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:04,037
Where?

23
00:05:04,087 --> 00:05:06,128
There's no point in even talking about it.

24
00:05:06,168 --> 00:05:08,211
Oh, come on, come on. Where?

25
00:05:08,262 --> 00:05:11,346
Kashmir. Got a code tip from
the bureau chief this morning.

26
00:05:12,436 --> 00:05:14,478
The place is about to go up in smoke.

27
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:17,612
What did I tell you? Didn't I tell
you that's the next place to watch?

28
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,693
You did.
When do I leave? Hour?

29
00:05:19,733 --> 00:05:22,827
With that cast on? You don't.
Stop sounding stuffy.

30
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:28,043
I can take pictures from a jeep
or a water buffalo, if necessary.

31
00:05:29,134 --> 00:05:32,218
You're too valuable to the magazine
for us to play around with.

32
00:05:32,257 --> 00:05:34,310
I'll send Morgan or Lambert.
Morgan or Lambert.

33
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,392
That's fine.

34
00:05:36,431 --> 00:05:39,525
I get myself half-killed for you,

35
00:05:39,566 --> 00:05:41,608
And you reward me by
stealing my assignments.

36
00:05:41,658 --> 00:05:44,740
I didn't ask you to stand in the
middle of an automobile racetrack.

37
00:05:45,832 --> 00:05:48,914
You asked for something
dramatically different.

38
00:05:48,955 --> 00:05:52,050
You got it.
So did you.

39
00:05:52,089 --> 00:05:54,142
Goodbye, Jeff.
Now, wait a minute, Gunnison.

40
00:05:54,182 --> 00:05:56,224
You've got to get me out of here.

41
00:05:56,263 --> 00:05:58,315
Six weeks sitting in a two-room apartment

42
00:05:58,355 --> 00:06:00,397
With nothing to do but look out
the window at the neighbours.

43
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:03,533
Bye, Jeff.
No, Gunnison, I...

44
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:06,665
If you don't pull me out
of this swamp of boredom,

45
00:06:06,706 --> 00:06:08,747
I'm gonna do something drastic.

46
00:06:08,787 --> 00:06:10,839
Like what?
Like what? Get married.

47
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:12,922
Then I'll never be able to go anywhere.

48
00:06:12,962 --> 00:06:13,963
lt's about time you got married,

49
00:06:14,013 --> 00:06:17,097
Before you turn into a
lonesome and bitter, old man.

50
00:06:19,228 --> 00:06:22,312
Yeach, can't you just see me?

51
00:06:22,363 --> 00:06:24,404
Rushing home to a hot apartment

52
00:06:24,444 --> 00:06:27,537
To listen to the automatic laundry
and the electric dishwasher

53
00:06:28,618 --> 00:06:31,712
And the garbage disposal
and the nagging wife.

54
00:06:33,834 --> 00:06:36,927
Jeff, wives don't nag
any more, they discuss.

55
00:06:36,968 --> 00:06:39,010
Is that so? Is that so?

56
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,144
Maybe in the high-rent
district they discuss.

57
00:06:42,185 --> 00:06:44,236
In my neighbourhood, they still nag.

58
00:06:44,276 --> 00:06:47,359
Well, you know best. I'll call you later.

59
00:06:48,451 --> 00:06:51,533
Yeach, have some good
news the next time, huh?

60
00:07:45,853 --> 00:07:47,896
Good morning. I said, Good morning!

61
00:07:47,936 --> 00:07:51,029
Oh, good morning.

62
00:08:07,767 --> 00:08:10,860
Say, I wouldn't dig so deep if I were you.

63
00:08:12,982 --> 00:08:16,076
You're giving them far too much water.

64
00:08:16,116 --> 00:08:19,210
Why don't you shut up?

65
00:08:21,332 --> 00:08:22,342
Well!

66
00:08:22,383 --> 00:08:25,465
I do declare.

67
00:08:26,558 --> 00:08:27,560
State sentence for a peeping tom,

68
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,641
Is six months in the workhouse.

69
00:08:29,681 --> 00:08:31,733
Oh, hello, sweetheart.

70
00:08:31,773 --> 00:08:33,815
They got no windows in the workhouse.

71
00:08:33,855 --> 00:08:36,948
In the old days, they used to put
your eyes out with a red-hot poker.

72
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:41,124
Any of those bikini bombshells
you're always watching

73
00:08:41,165 --> 00:08:43,216
Worth a red-hot poker?

74
00:08:43,255 --> 00:08:45,297
Oh, dear.

75
00:08:45,337 --> 00:08:47,390
We've become a race of Peeping Toms.

76
00:08:47,431 --> 00:08:50,514
What people ought to do is
get outside their own house

77
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:51,564
And look in for a change.

78
00:08:51,604 --> 00:08:54,687
Yes, sir. How's that for a
bit of homespun philosophy?

79
00:08:55,779 --> 00:08:57,821
Reader's Digest, April 1939.

80
00:08:57,861 --> 00:09:00,954
Well, I only quote from the best.

81
00:09:00,995 --> 00:09:03,037
You don't have to take my
temperature this morning.

82
00:09:03,087 --> 00:09:06,171
Quiet. See if you can break 100.

83
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:08,262
You know, I should have
been a gypsy fortune-teller

84
00:09:08,304 --> 00:09:10,345
Instead of an insurance company nurse.

85
00:09:10,386 --> 00:09:13,479
I got a nose for trouble.
Can smell it ten miles away.

86
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:17,652
You heard of that market crash in 29?
I predicted that.

87
00:09:19,786 --> 00:09:21,828
Just how did you do that, Stella?

88
00:09:21,868 --> 00:09:24,961
Oh, simple. I was nursing a
director of General Motors.

89
00:09:26,042 --> 00:09:29,135
Kidney ailment, they said. Nerves, I said.

90
00:09:31,258 --> 00:09:32,270
Then I asked myself,

91
00:09:32,309 --> 00:09:35,393
'What's General Motors
got to be nervous about?

92
00:09:35,432 --> 00:09:38,525
Overproduction, I says. Collapse.

93
00:09:39,607 --> 00:09:42,700
When General Motors has to go to
the bathroom ten times a day,

94
00:09:42,741 --> 00:09:45,834
The whole country's ready to let go.

95
00:09:46,915 --> 00:09:50,007
You know, Stella, in
economics, a kidney ailment

96
00:09:50,049 --> 00:09:51,050
Has no relationship to the stock market.

97
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,182
None whatsoever.
Crashed, didn't it?

98
00:09:54,223 --> 00:09:57,316
I can smell trouble right
here in this apartment.

99
00:09:58,398 --> 00:09:59,399
First you smash your leg,

100
00:09:59,439 --> 00:10:02,533
Then you get to looking out the window,

101
00:10:02,573 --> 00:10:04,614
See things you shouldn't see.

102
00:10:04,664 --> 00:10:06,706
Trouble.

103
00:10:06,746 --> 00:10:08,788
I can see you in court now

104
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:11,924
Surrounded by a bunch of lawyers
in double-breasted suits.

105
00:10:11,963 --> 00:10:12,964
You're pleading.

106
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:16,098
You say, Judge, it was only
a bit of innocent fun.

107
00:10:17,187 --> 00:10:20,270
I love my neighbours, like a father.

108
00:10:20,311 --> 00:10:22,364
And the judge says, 'Well, congratulations.

109
00:10:22,404 --> 00:10:25,488
You've just given birth to
three years in Dannamora.

110
00:10:26,578 --> 00:10:28,620
Right now, I'd welcome trouble.

111
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:30,712
You've got a hormone deficiency.

112
00:10:30,753 --> 00:10:32,794
How can you tell from a thermometer?

113
00:10:32,835 --> 00:10:33,836
Those bathing beauties you've been watching

114
00:10:33,886 --> 00:10:36,969
Haven't raised your temperature
one degree in a month.

115
00:10:41,185 --> 00:10:44,277
Here we go.

116
00:10:45,358 --> 00:10:48,452
One more week.

117
00:10:52,667 --> 00:10:54,720
I think you're right.

118
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:56,801
I think there is gonna
be trouble around here.

119
00:10:56,841 --> 00:10:57,843
I knew it.

120
00:10:57,882 --> 00:11:00,975
Ooh. Do you ever heat that stuff?

121
00:11:02,067 --> 00:11:05,151
Gives your circulation something to fight.

122
00:11:05,191 --> 00:11:08,284
What kind of trouble?
Lisa Fremont.

123
00:11:08,324 --> 00:11:11,417
You kidding? She's a beautiful, young girl,

124
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:14,540
And you're a reasonably healthy young man.

125
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,632
She expects me to marry her.
That's normal.

126
00:11:16,673 --> 00:11:18,715
I don't want to.
That's abnormal.

127
00:11:18,764 --> 00:11:21,848
I'm just not ready for marriage.

128
00:11:21,888 --> 00:11:24,983
Every man's ready for marriage
when the right girl comes along.

129
00:11:25,022 --> 00:11:28,115
Lisa Fremont is the right girl
for any man with half a brain

130
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:29,156
Who can get one eye open.

131
00:11:29,195 --> 00:11:31,239
She's alright.

132
00:11:31,289 --> 00:11:33,331
What did you do, have a fight?
No.

133
00:11:33,371 --> 00:11:36,464
Father loading up the shotgun?
What?

134
00:11:36,505 --> 00:11:38,546
Please, Stella.
It's happened before, you know.

135
00:11:38,586 --> 00:11:41,679
Some of the world's happiest marriages have

136
00:11:41,719 --> 00:11:43,763
Started under the gun,' as you might say.

137
00:11:43,814 --> 00:11:46,896
No, she's just not the girl for me.
Yeach, she's only perfect.

138
00:11:46,937 --> 00:11:48,988
She's too perfect. She's too talented.

139
00:11:49,027 --> 00:11:52,121
She's too beautiful.
She's too sophisticated.

140
00:11:52,161 --> 00:11:54,203
She's too everything, but what I want.

141
00:11:54,244 --> 00:11:57,338
Is what you want something you can discuss?

142
00:11:57,378 --> 00:12:00,471
What? It's very simple, Stella.

143
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:03,594
She belongs to that rarefied
atmosphere of Park Avenue:

144
00:12:03,634 --> 00:12:06,727
Expensive restaurants and
literary cocktail parties.

145
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09,861
People with sense belong
wherever they're put.

146
00:12:09,901 --> 00:12:12,994
Can you imagine her tramping
around the world with a camera bum

147
00:12:13,034 --> 00:12:15,076
Who never has more than a
week's salary in the bank?

148
00:12:15,116 --> 00:12:18,209
If she was only ordinary.

149
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,293
You never gonna get married?

150
00:12:20,342 --> 00:12:22,384
I'll probably get married
one of these days,

151
00:12:22,425 --> 00:12:24,466
But when I do, it's gonna be
to someone who thinks of life

152
00:12:24,517 --> 00:12:27,600
Not just as a new dress
and a lobster dinner

153
00:12:29,733 --> 00:12:31,775
And the latest scandal.

154
00:12:31,814 --> 00:12:34,907
I need a woman who's willing to... Hold it.

155
00:12:34,947 --> 00:12:38,042
Who's willing to go anywhere
and do anything and love it.

156
00:12:39,123 --> 00:12:42,216
So the honest thing for me to do
is just call the whole thing off.

157
00:12:42,256 --> 00:12:44,297
Let her find somebody else.

158
00:12:44,337 --> 00:12:46,390
Yeach, I can hear you now.

159
00:12:46,431 --> 00:12:49,515
Get out of my life, you
perfectly wonderful woman.

160
00:12:50,605 --> 00:12:52,647
Look, Mr Jefferies, I'm
not an educated woman,

161
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:54,739
But I can tell you one thing.

162
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:57,863
When a man and a woman see each
other and like each other,

163
00:12:58,954 --> 00:13:00,996
They ought to come together, wham,

164
00:13:01,036 --> 00:13:03,090
Like a couple of taxis on Broadway

165
00:13:03,129 --> 00:13:05,171
And not sit around analysing each other

166
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:07,263
Like two specimens in a bottle.

167
00:13:07,303 --> 00:13:10,396
There's an intelligent way
to approach marriage.

168
00:13:10,436 --> 00:13:11,438
Intelligence.

169
00:13:11,477 --> 00:13:14,571
Nothing has caused the human race
so much trouble as intelligence.

170
00:13:15,653 --> 00:13:17,695
Modern marriage.

171
00:13:17,735 --> 00:13:20,828
No, we've progressed emotionally.
Baloney.

172
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,044
Once it was see somebody,
get excited, get married.

173
00:13:27,135 --> 00:13:28,136
Now, it's read a lot of books,

174
00:13:28,177 --> 00:13:31,270
Fence with a lot of four-syllable
words, psychoanalyse each other

175
00:13:32,351 --> 00:13:34,392
Until you can't tell the difference

176
00:13:34,442 --> 00:13:37,526
Between a petting party
and a civil service exam.

177
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:40,659
People have different emotional levels -

178
00:13:40,699 --> 00:13:43,793
When I married Myles, we were both
a couple of maladjusted misfits.

179
00:13:44,874 --> 00:13:47,967
We are still maladjusted, and we
have loved every minute of it.

180
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:51,091
0Well, that's fine, Stella.

181
00:13:51,141 --> 00:13:53,183
Now, would you fix me a sandwich, please?

182
00:13:53,222 --> 00:13:56,316
Yes, I will. And I'll spread a
little common sense on the bread.

183
00:13:57,397 --> 00:14:00,492
Lisa's loaded to her
fingertips with love for you.

184
00:14:00,531 --> 00:14:03,615
I got two words of advice
for you: Marry her.

185
00:14:03,665 --> 00:14:06,747
She pay you much?
Oh.

186
00:14:23,486 --> 00:14:26,579
There you are.

187
00:14:28,712 --> 00:14:31,795
Here's the key.
Thank you.

188
00:14:38,103 --> 00:14:41,197
Well, if you want anything, just ring.

189
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:55,802
Honey.

190
00:14:55,841 --> 00:14:58,934
Come on.

191
00:15:05,242 --> 00:15:08,324
Got to carry you over the threshold.

192
00:15:30,289 --> 00:15:33,373
Window shopper.

193
00:16:21,425 --> 00:16:23,467
How's your leg?

194
00:16:23,517 --> 00:16:25,559
It hurts a little.

195
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,693
And your stomach?
Empty as a football.

196
00:16:31,867 --> 00:16:33,908
And your love life?

197
00:16:33,949 --> 00:16:35,992
Not too active.

198
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:39,125
Anything else bothering you?

199
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,216
Mm-hm.

200
00:16:41,256 --> 00:16:44,338
Who are you?

201
00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:47,474
Reading from top to bottom:

202
00:16:47,513 --> 00:16:50,606
Lisa...

203
00:16:52,738 --> 00:16:55,821
Carol...

204
00:16:57,955 --> 00:17:01,049
Fremont.

205
00:17:01,088 --> 00:17:04,171
Is this the Lisa Fremont who never
wears the same dress twice?

206
00:17:04,211 --> 00:17:07,305
Only because it's expected of her.

207
00:17:07,345 --> 00:17:09,396
It's right off the Paris plane.

208
00:17:09,436 --> 00:17:12,520
Do you think it'll sell?
That depends on the quote.

209
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:14,613
Let's see now.
There's the aeroplane ticket over,

210
00:17:14,652 --> 00:17:16,694
Import duties, hidden taxes,

211
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:19,828
Profit markup
A steal at $1,100.

212
00:17:19,868 --> 00:17:22,961
Eleven hundred?

213
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:25,045
They ought to list that dress
on the stock exchange.

214
00:17:25,096 --> 00:17:28,178
We sell a dozen a day in this price range.

215
00:17:28,219 --> 00:17:30,270
Who buys them, tax collectors?

216
00:17:30,309 --> 00:17:32,351
Even if I had to pay, it would be worth it.

217
00:17:32,392 --> 00:17:35,485
Just for the occasion.
Why, is something big going on?

218
00:17:35,524 --> 00:17:38,619
It's going on right here. It's a big night.

219
00:17:38,659 --> 00:17:41,742
It's just an old run-of-the-mill Wednesday.

220
00:17:41,792 --> 00:17:43,834
The calendar's full of them.

221
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:46,968
It's opening night of the last depressing
week of L B Jefferies in a cast.

222
00:17:48,049 --> 00:17:51,143
Well, I haven't noticed a
big demand for tickets.

223
00:17:52,224 --> 00:17:55,316
That's because I bought out the house.

224
00:17:55,357 --> 00:17:58,439
You know, this cigarette
box has seen better days.

225
00:17:59,532 --> 00:18:02,625
I picked that up in Shanghai,
which has also seen better days.

226
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:04,707
It's cracked and you never use it.

227
00:18:04,747 --> 00:18:06,800
It's too ornate.

228
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,924
I'm sending up a plain, flat,
silver one with your initials.

229
00:18:11,014 --> 00:18:14,097
That's no way to spend
your hard-earned money.

230
00:18:14,138 --> 00:18:17,232
I wanted to.

231
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:21,406
What would you think of starting
off with dinner at 21 ?

232
00:18:21,445 --> 00:18:24,538
You have, perhaps, an ambulance downstairs?

233
00:18:24,578 --> 00:18:27,671
No, better than that: 21 .

234
00:18:32,928 --> 00:18:36,021
Thank you for waiting, Carl.
The kitchen's right there on the left.

235
00:18:36,062 --> 00:18:39,144
I'll take the wine.

236
00:18:41,277 --> 00:18:42,278
Good evening, Mr Jefferies.
Carl.

237
00:18:42,318 --> 00:18:45,411
Just put everything in
the oven, Carl, on low.

238
00:18:46,493 --> 00:18:49,586
Let's open the wine now.
Alright.

239
00:18:49,627 --> 00:18:52,720
It's a Montrachet.
A great big glassful.

240
00:18:52,759 --> 00:18:55,843
There's a corkscrew right over there.

241
00:18:55,893 --> 00:18:58,977
Here, I'll do it.

242
00:18:59,016 --> 00:19:02,110
Big enough?
Yeach, they're fine.

243
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:04,191
I can't think of anything
more boring or tiresome

244
00:19:04,241 --> 00:19:07,325
Than what you've been through and
the last week must be the hardest.

245
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:11,501
Alright. Yeach, I want to get
this thing off and get moving.

246
00:19:12,592 --> 00:19:15,675
Well, I'm going to make this
a week you'll never forget.

247
00:19:17,807 --> 00:19:20,901
Fine, thanks.

248
00:19:20,941 --> 00:19:22,984
Just a minute, Carl.

249
00:19:23,022 --> 00:19:25,075
This will take care of the taxi.
Thank you, Miss Fremont.

250
00:19:25,115 --> 00:19:28,198
Have a pleasant dinner, Mr Jefferies.
Alright, Good night.

251
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:33,423
Good night.

252
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:35,508
What a day I've had.

253
00:19:35,547 --> 00:19:37,598
Are you tired?
Not a bit.

254
00:19:37,639 --> 00:19:39,680
I was all morning in a meeting,

255
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,814
Then I had to dash to the Waldorf for
a quick drink with Madam Dufrene,

256
00:19:42,855 --> 00:19:45,948
Who's just over from Paris
with some spy reports.

257
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:51,164
Then I had to go to 21 and have lunch
with the Harper's Bazaar people.

258
00:19:52,246 --> 00:19:54,297
That's when I ordered dinner.

259
00:19:54,337 --> 00:19:57,420
Then I had two fall
showings 20 blocks apart.

260
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,511
Then I had to have a cocktail
with Leland and Slim Hayward.

261
00:19:59,551 --> 00:20:01,595
We're trying to get his new show.

262
00:20:01,645 --> 00:20:03,687
Then I had to dash back and change.

263
00:20:03,728 --> 00:20:06,821
Well, now, tell me, what
was Mrs Hayward wearing?

264
00:20:07,902 --> 00:20:09,944
She looked wonderfully cool.
She didn't, did she?

265
00:20:09,993 --> 00:20:13,076
She had on the most divine
Italian hand-printed -

266
00:20:13,117 --> 00:20:15,170
Oh, Italian?
Oh, you.

267
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:18,293
Italian. Imagine.
To think I planted three nice items

268
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,427
In the columns about you today.
You did?

269
00:20:21,466 --> 00:20:24,560
You can't buy that kind of publicity.
I know.

270
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:27,693
Someday you may want to open
up a studio of your own here.

271
00:20:28,774 --> 00:20:31,867
How would I run it from, say, Pakistan?

272
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:36,042
Jeff...

273
00:20:36,082 --> 00:20:39,176
Isn't it time you came home?
You could pick your assignment.

274
00:20:41,298 --> 00:20:44,391
I wish there was one I wanted.
Make the one you want.

275
00:20:44,432 --> 00:20:46,474
You mean leave the magazine?
Yes.

276
00:20:46,514 --> 00:20:49,606
For what?
For yourself and me.

277
00:20:50,698 --> 00:20:52,740
I could get you a dozen
assignments tomorrow:

278
00:20:52,779 --> 00:20:54,823
Fashions, portraits.

279
00:20:54,873 --> 00:20:57,957
Now, don't laugh. I could do it.
That's what I'm afraid of.

280
00:20:59,047 --> 00:21:02,130
Can you see me driving down to
the fashion salon in a jeep

281
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:05,262
Wearing combat boots and a three-day beard?
Wouldn't that make a hit?

282
00:21:06,346 --> 00:21:09,438
I could see you looking very
handsome and successful

283
00:21:09,479 --> 00:21:11,521
In a dark blue, flannel suit.

284
00:21:11,571 --> 00:21:14,653
Let's stop talking nonsense, shall we?

285
00:21:14,694 --> 00:21:17,787
Hm?

286
00:21:18,868 --> 00:21:21,962
Guess I'd better start
setting up for dinner.

287
00:23:26,197 --> 00:23:28,250
Miss Lonelyhearts.

288
00:23:28,289 --> 00:23:31,375
At least that's something you'll
never have to worry about.

289
00:23:31,425 --> 00:23:32,425
Oh?

290
00:23:32,464 --> 00:23:35,548
You can see my apartment from here,
all the way up on 63rd Street?

291
00:23:36,639 --> 00:23:39,722
0No, not exactly, but we
have a little apartment here

292
00:23:39,772 --> 00:23:41,815
That's probably as popular as yours.

293
00:23:41,854 --> 00:23:44,948
You remember, of course, Miss
Torso, the ballet dancer?

294
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:50,163
She's like a queen bee with
her pick of the drones.

295
00:23:59,594 --> 00:24:02,688
I'd say she's doing a woman's hardest job.

296
00:24:02,727 --> 00:24:05,820
Juggling wolves.

297
00:24:10,035 --> 00:24:13,129
Thank you.

298
00:24:23,601 --> 00:24:26,694
Well, she picked the most
prosperous-looking one.

299
00:24:26,734 --> 00:24:29,827
She's not in love with him...
Or any of them.

300
00:24:29,866 --> 00:24:32,950
Oh, how can you tell that from here?

301
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:37,126
You said it resembled my
apartment, didn't you?

302
00:24:52,822 --> 00:24:55,916
I hope they're cooked this time.

303
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,580
Where's that wonderful music coming from?

304
00:26:23,621 --> 00:26:26,714
Some songwriter over there
in the studio apartment.

305
00:26:26,754 --> 00:26:28,796
Well...

306
00:26:28,846 --> 00:26:30,889
He lives alone.

307
00:26:30,929 --> 00:26:34,022
Probably had a very unhappy marriage.

308
00:26:34,062 --> 00:26:37,155
Oh, it's enchanting.

309
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:42,371
It's almost as if it were being
written especially for us.

310
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:45,504
Hm. No wonder he's having
so much trouble with it.

311
00:26:49,719 --> 00:26:52,803
At least you can't say
the dinner isn't right.

312
00:26:52,842 --> 00:26:55,935
Lisa... It's perfect.

313
00:26:57,016 --> 00:27:00,111
As always.

314
00:27:10,592 --> 00:27:13,676
There can't be that much difference
between people and the way they live.

315
00:27:13,726 --> 00:27:15,768
We all eat, talk, drink,
laugh, wear clothes.

316
00:27:15,808 --> 00:27:17,849
Well, now look -

317
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,943
If you're saying all this because you
don't want to tell me the truth,

318
00:27:19,983 --> 00:27:23,075
Because you're hiding something from
me, then maybe I can understand.

319
00:27:23,116 --> 00:27:25,158
I'm not hiding anything. It's just that -

320
00:27:25,197 --> 00:27:26,198
It doesn't make sense.

321
00:27:26,249 --> 00:27:29,333
What's so different about it here
from there or anyplace you go

322
00:27:29,373 --> 00:27:32,466
That one person couldn't live
in both places just as easily?

323
00:27:32,506 --> 00:27:33,507
Some people can.
Now, if you'll just let me -

324
00:27:33,547 --> 00:27:36,640
What is it but travelling from one
place to another taking pictures?

325
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,774
It's like being a tourist
on an endless vacation.

326
00:27:39,814 --> 00:27:41,856
OK. That's your opinion.
You're entitled to it.

327
00:27:41,897 --> 00:27:43,949
Now, let me give you my side.
It's ridiculous to say

328
00:27:43,989 --> 00:27:47,072
That it can only be done by a special,
private little group of anointed people.

329
00:27:48,162 --> 00:27:51,256
I made a simple statement,
a true statement,

330
00:27:51,296 --> 00:27:54,380
But I can back it up if you'll
just shut up for a minute.

331
00:27:54,419 --> 00:27:57,512
If your opinion is as rude as your
manner, I don't think I care to hear it.

332
00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:00,646
Oh, come on now. Simmer down.

333
00:28:00,686 --> 00:28:02,729
I can't fit in here.
You can't fit in there.

334
00:28:02,769 --> 00:28:04,820
According to you, people
should be born, live and die

335
00:28:04,861 --> 00:28:07,955
On the same spot!
Shut up!

336
00:28:10,078 --> 00:28:13,170
Did you ever eat fish heads and rice?
Of course not.

337
00:28:14,251 --> 00:28:16,304
Well, you might have to
if you went with me.

338
00:28:16,343 --> 00:28:19,427
Did you ever try to keep warm
in a C-54 at 15,000 feet,

339
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:22,562
20 degrees below zero?

340
00:28:22,601 --> 00:28:24,652
Oh, I do it all the time,

341
00:28:24,693 --> 00:28:26,735
Whenever I have a few minutes after lunch.

342
00:28:26,774 --> 00:28:28,827
Did you ever get shot at? Run over?

343
00:28:28,867 --> 00:28:29,867
Did you ever get sandbagged

344
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:33,002
Because somebody got unfavourable
publicity from your camera?

345
00:28:33,042 --> 00:28:36,126
Did you ever... Those high heels,
they'll be great in the jungle.

346
00:28:36,176 --> 00:28:38,218
And the nylons and those
six-ounce lingerie.

347
00:28:38,257 --> 00:28:40,299
Three.
Alright, three.

348
00:28:40,349 --> 00:28:43,432
They'll make a big hit in Finland,
just before you freeze to death.

349
00:28:43,473 --> 00:28:46,567
Well, if there's one thing I know,
it's how to wear the proper clothes.

350
00:28:47,648 --> 00:28:48,649
Yeach, yeach.

351
00:28:48,699 --> 00:28:51,782
Well, try and find a raincoat in
Brazil, even when it isn't raining.

352
00:28:52,874 --> 00:28:55,957
Lisa, in this job you carry one suitcase.

353
00:28:55,996 --> 00:28:59,090
Your home is the available transportation.

354
00:28:59,131 --> 00:29:01,173
You don't sleep very much. You bathe less.

355
00:29:01,223 --> 00:29:03,264
And sometimes the food that you eat

356
00:29:03,305 --> 00:29:06,398
Is made from things that you couldn't
even look at when they're alive.

357
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:10,572
Jeff, you don't have to be deliberately
repulsive just to impress me I'm wrong.

358
00:29:10,612 --> 00:29:13,706
Deliberately repulsive?
I'm trying to make it sound good.

359
00:29:13,746 --> 00:29:16,830
You just have to face it, Lisa, you're
not meant for that kind of a life.

360
00:29:17,921 --> 00:29:21,004
Few people are.

361
00:29:21,043 --> 00:29:24,138
You're too stubborn to argue with.
I'm not stubborn. I'm just truthful.

362
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:29,353
I know, a lesser man would have
told me it was one long holiday,

363
00:29:29,402 --> 00:29:32,486
And I would have awakened
to a rude disillusionment.

364
00:29:33,578 --> 00:29:35,620
Well, now, wait a minute.

365
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:38,753
If you want to get vicious on this thing,
I'd be happy to accommodate you.

366
00:29:41,927 --> 00:29:45,010
No, I don't particularly want that.

367
00:29:48,182 --> 00:29:49,186
So that's it?

368
00:29:49,224 --> 00:29:52,318
You won't stay here, and
I can't go with you.

369
00:29:52,358 --> 00:29:55,451
It would be the wrong thing.

370
00:29:56,533 --> 00:29:59,626
You don't think either one
of us could ever change?

371
00:30:00,707 --> 00:30:03,801
Right now it doesn't seem so.

372
00:30:08,016 --> 00:30:10,058
I-I'm in love with you.

373
00:30:10,098 --> 00:30:13,190
I don't care what you do for a living.

374
00:30:13,231 --> 00:30:16,325
I'd like to be part of it somehow.

375
00:30:18,446 --> 00:30:21,540
It's deflating to find out the
only way I can be part of it,

376
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:24,672
Is to take out a subscription
to your magazine.

377
00:30:25,755 --> 00:30:28,847
I guess I'm not the girl I thought I was.

378
00:30:28,888 --> 00:30:30,931
There's nothing wrong with you, Lisa.

379
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:34,063
You've got this town in
the palm of your hand.

380
00:30:35,144 --> 00:30:38,238
Not quite, it seems.

381
00:30:39,319 --> 00:30:41,371
Goodbye, Jeff.

382
00:30:41,411 --> 00:30:42,412
You mean good night.

383
00:30:42,453 --> 00:30:45,546
I mean what I said.
Well, Lisa...

384
00:30:46,628 --> 00:30:49,721
Couldn't we just...

385
00:30:49,762 --> 00:30:52,854
Couldn't we just... Keep things status quo?

386
00:30:56,028 --> 00:30:58,071
Without any future?

387
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:01,203
Well, when am I gonna see you again?

388
00:31:02,284 --> 00:31:05,377
Not for a long time.

389
00:31:05,418 --> 00:31:08,500
At least... Not until tomorrow night.

390
00:32:12,211 --> 00:32:15,305
Hey! Rain.

391
00:32:17,426 --> 00:32:20,520
Grab that. Wait, I'll get the clock.

392
00:32:22,652 --> 00:32:25,734
Oh, no!

393
00:32:25,775 --> 00:32:28,868
Pull it.

394
00:32:31,002 --> 00:32:34,085
0Pull on it. Let me do it.

395
00:32:35,174 --> 00:32:38,259
In you go.

396
00:34:52,936 --> 00:34:56,030
No, you can't come in. It's much too late.

397
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:57,069
No, not now.

398
00:34:57,111 --> 00:35:00,204
No, I said good night.

399
00:36:41,474 --> 00:36:43,527
What's that supposed to be, ma'am?

400
00:36:43,566 --> 00:36:46,659
It's called hunger.

401
00:37:08,613 --> 00:37:11,706
You'd think the rain would
have cooled things off.

402
00:37:11,747 --> 00:37:13,791
All it did was make the heat wet.
Ahh, that's it.

403
00:37:13,828 --> 00:37:16,922
That's stiff right there. Right there.

404
00:37:16,963 --> 00:37:19,005
The insurance company would be much happier

405
00:37:19,054 --> 00:37:22,138
If you'd sleep in bed at night
instead of in that wheelchair.

406
00:37:22,178 --> 00:37:24,230
How do you know?
Eyes are all bloodshot.

407
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:27,354
Must have been watching out
that window for hours.

408
00:37:27,403 --> 00:37:28,404
0Yeach, I was.

409
00:37:28,444 --> 00:37:29,447
What are you gonna do if
one of them catches you?

410
00:37:29,487 --> 00:37:32,579
It depends which one.
Miss Torso, for example -

411
00:37:32,621 --> 00:37:35,703
You keep your mind off her.

412
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,795
She sure is the 'eat,
drink and be merry girl.

413
00:37:37,834 --> 00:37:40,928
Yeach, she'll wind up fat,
alcoholic and miserable.

414
00:37:40,968 --> 00:37:43,011
Yeach.

415
00:37:43,051 --> 00:37:46,144
Speaking of misery, poor Miss Lonelyhearts.

416
00:37:46,184 --> 00:37:49,277
She drank herself to sleep again, alone.

417
00:37:49,317 --> 00:37:52,411
Poor soul. Maybe one day
she'll find her happiness.

418
00:37:53,492 --> 00:37:55,536
Yeach, and some man will lose his.

419
00:37:55,576 --> 00:37:57,627
Isn't there anybody in the neighbourhood

420
00:37:57,667 --> 00:37:59,709
Who could cast an eye in her direction?

421
00:37:59,749 --> 00:38:01,802
Well...

422
00:38:01,841 --> 00:38:04,935
It might just be that the
salesman will be available soon.

423
00:38:04,975 --> 00:38:07,016
Oh, him and his wife splitting up?

424
00:38:07,058 --> 00:38:09,110
I just can't figure it.

425
00:38:09,149 --> 00:38:11,192
He went out several times
last night in the rain,

426
00:38:11,232 --> 00:38:14,325
Carrying his sample case.
Well, he's a salesman, isn't he?

427
00:38:14,365 --> 00:38:17,459
What would he be selling at
three o'clock in the morning?

428
00:38:17,498 --> 00:38:20,583
Flashlights. Luminous dials for watches.

429
00:38:20,633 --> 00:38:23,715
House numbers that light up.

430
00:38:23,757 --> 00:38:24,757
I don't think so.

431
00:38:24,808 --> 00:38:26,849
I don't think so.

432
00:38:26,889 --> 00:38:29,982
I think he was taking something
out of the apartment.

433
00:38:30,022 --> 00:38:33,104
Uh-huh. His personal effects.

434
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:38,332
He's gonna run out on her, the coward.

435
00:38:38,372 --> 00:38:41,455
Yeach. Sometimes it's worse
to stay than it is to run.

436
00:38:41,504 --> 00:38:44,588
Yeach, well, it takes a particularly low
type of man to do a thing like that.

437
00:38:47,761 --> 00:38:49,804
How about this morning?

438
00:38:49,854 --> 00:38:51,896
Any further developments?

439
00:38:51,936 --> 00:38:53,988
The shades are all drawn in the apartment.

440
00:38:54,029 --> 00:38:56,070
In this heat?
Yeach.

441
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:59,203
Well, they're up now.

442
00:39:03,418 --> 00:39:06,512
Get back! Get back.
Where do you want me to go?

443
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:09,635
Come on, get out of sight.
What's the matter?

444
00:39:09,676 --> 00:39:12,769
That salesman's looking out
of his window. You see?

445
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:14,861
Get back! He'll see you.

446
00:39:14,902 --> 00:39:16,943
I'm not shy. I've been looked at before.

447
00:39:16,984 --> 00:39:20,077
That's no ordinary look.

448
00:39:21,158 --> 00:39:22,159
That's the kind of look a man gives

449
00:39:22,209 --> 00:39:25,291
When he's afraid somebody
might be watching him.

450
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:44,083
Get away from there.

451
00:39:44,123 --> 00:39:46,165
He'll be after you. Go on, into the house.

452
00:39:46,205 --> 00:39:49,299
Into the house. Shoo, shoo.

453
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:53,474
Goodbye, Mr Jefferies. See you tomorrow.

454
00:40:02,903 --> 00:40:05,997
And don't sleep in that chair again.
Uh-huh.

455
00:40:06,037 --> 00:40:09,131
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Great conversationalist.

456
00:40:12,304 --> 00:40:14,346
Stella...

457
00:40:14,385 --> 00:40:17,478
Take those binoculars out and
bring them here, will you?

458
00:40:18,561 --> 00:40:19,562
Trouble.

459
00:40:19,603 --> 00:40:22,695
I can smell it.

460
00:40:22,736 --> 00:40:25,829
I'll be glad when they crack that
cast, and I can get outta here.

461
00:44:02,954 --> 00:44:06,039
How far does a girl have to
go before you'll notice her?

462
00:44:06,077 --> 00:44:09,172
Well, if she's pretty enough, she
doesn't have to go anywhere.

463
00:44:10,263 --> 00:44:12,305
She just has to be.'

464
00:44:12,345 --> 00:44:14,387
Well, ain't I?

465
00:44:14,437 --> 00:44:17,521
Pay attention to me.

466
00:44:18,612 --> 00:44:21,696
I'm not exactly on the
other side of the room.

467
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:25,869
Your mind is...
And when I want a man, I want all of him.

468
00:44:31,136 --> 00:44:34,219
Don't you ever have any problems?

469
00:44:34,259 --> 00:44:37,352
I have one now.

470
00:44:37,392 --> 00:44:40,486
So do I.

471
00:44:40,527 --> 00:44:43,609
Tell me about it.

472
00:44:44,701 --> 00:44:46,742
Why?

473
00:44:46,782 --> 00:44:49,877
Why would a man leave his
apartment three times

474
00:44:50,958 --> 00:44:54,052
On a rainy night with a suitcase,
and come back three times?

475
00:44:55,132 --> 00:44:58,225
He likes the way his
wife welcomes him home.

476
00:44:59,307 --> 00:45:02,399
No, no. Not this salesman's wife.

477
00:45:02,439 --> 00:45:04,492
And why didn't he go to work today?

478
00:45:04,532 --> 00:45:07,615
Homework. It's more interesting.

479
00:45:08,707 --> 00:45:11,790
What's interesting about a butcher knife

480
00:45:12,881 --> 00:45:15,964
And a small saw

481
00:45:16,004 --> 00:45:19,097
Wrapped in newspaper?

482
00:45:19,138 --> 00:45:21,192
Nothing, thank heaven.

483
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:24,315
Why hasn't he been in his
wife's bedroom all day?

484
00:45:24,365 --> 00:45:27,447
I wouldn't dare answer that.

485
00:45:27,487 --> 00:45:30,580
Well, listen. I'll answer it, Lisa.

486
00:45:30,621 --> 00:45:33,714
There's something terribly wrong.

487
00:45:35,836 --> 00:45:38,929
And I'm afraid it's with me.
What do you think?

488
00:45:41,062 --> 00:45:44,145
Something too frightful to utter.

489
00:45:44,185 --> 00:45:47,279
He went out a few minutes ago in
his undershirt, hasn't come back.

490
00:46:01,935 --> 00:46:05,018
That would be a terrible job to tackle.

491
00:46:10,283 --> 00:46:13,368
Just how would you start
to cut up a human body?

492
00:46:16,541 --> 00:46:19,634
Jeff, I'll be honest with you.
You're beginning to scare me.

493
00:46:22,807 --> 00:46:25,892
Jeff, did you hear what I said?
You're beginning to scare -

494
00:46:25,931 --> 00:46:29,024
Shh! He's coming back!

495
00:46:56,204 --> 00:46:59,287
Jeff, if you could only see yourself!
What's the matter?

496
00:46:59,337 --> 00:47:02,420
Sitting around looking out of the
window to kill time is one thing,

497
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:04,513
But doing it the way you
are with binoculars

498
00:47:04,554 --> 00:47:07,637
And wild opinions about every
little thing you see is diseased!

499
00:47:08,727 --> 00:47:11,811
Do you think I consider it recreation?

500
00:47:11,861 --> 00:47:13,903
I don't know what you consider it,

501
00:47:13,943 --> 00:47:15,986
0But if you don't stop it,
I'm getting out of here.

502
00:47:16,036 --> 00:47:18,078
What's the
What is it you're looking for?

503
00:47:18,118 --> 00:47:21,211
I just want to find out what's the
matter with the salesman's wife.

504
00:47:21,251 --> 00:47:23,293
Does that make me sound like a madman?

505
00:47:23,333 --> 00:47:25,386
What makes you think there's
something the matter with her?

506
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:28,519
A lot of things. She's an invalid.
She demands constant care.

507
00:47:28,558 --> 00:47:31,643
Yet not the husband or anybody else
has been in to see her all day. Why?

508
00:47:34,817 --> 00:47:37,909
Maybe she died.
Where's the doctor?

509
00:47:37,949 --> 00:47:38,951
Where's the undertaker?

510
00:47:38,990 --> 00:47:42,083
She could be sleeping, under sedatives.

511
00:47:42,124 --> 00:47:45,218
He's in there now. There's nothing to see.

512
00:47:45,258 --> 00:47:47,300
There is something.
I've seen it through that window.

513
00:47:47,339 --> 00:47:50,433
I've seen bickering and family quarrels

514
00:47:50,473 --> 00:47:51,474
And mysterious trips at night

515
00:47:51,514 --> 00:47:53,565
And knives and saws and rope.

516
00:47:53,606 --> 00:47:55,147
Now, since last evening,
not a sign of the wife.

517
00:47:55,148 --> 00:47:56,688
Tell me where she is.

518
00:47:56,739 --> 00:47:58,782
I don't know.
What's she doing?

519
00:47:58,823 --> 00:48:01,916
Maybe he's leaving his wife.
I don't know. I don't care!

520
00:48:01,956 --> 00:48:05,038
Lots of people have knives and saws
and ropes around their houses.

521
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:08,174
And lots of men don't speak
to their wives all day.

522
00:48:08,212 --> 00:48:11,306
Lots of wives nag and men
hate them and trouble starts,

523
00:48:11,346 --> 00:48:14,439
But few of them end up in murder,
if that's what you're thinking.

524
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,562
It's pretty hard for you to keep
away from that word, isn't it?

525
00:48:17,613 --> 00:48:19,655
You could see all that
he did, couldn't you?

526
00:48:19,694 --> 00:48:22,787
Of course, I
You could see coœ the shades were up

527
00:48:22,827 --> 00:48:25,911
And he walked along the corridor
and the street and the backyard.

528
00:48:25,962 --> 00:48:26,963
I've seen him -

529
00:48:27,003 --> 00:48:30,087
Jeff, do you think a murderer
would let you see all that?

530
00:48:30,137 --> 00:48:33,219
That he wouldn't pull the shades
down and hide behind them?

531
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:35,312
He's being clever. He's being nonchalant.

532
00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:37,394
And that's where you're not bring clever.

533
00:48:37,435 --> 00:48:40,528
A murderer would never parade his
crime in front of an open window.

534
00:48:40,567 --> 00:48:42,620
Why not?

535
00:48:42,659 --> 00:48:45,743
For all you know, there's something
sinister going on there.

536
00:48:46,834 --> 00:48:49,919
Where? Oh.

537
00:48:49,958 --> 00:48:53,051
No comment.

538
00:49:15,014 --> 00:49:18,099
Let's start from the beginning again, Jeff.

539
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:22,273
Tell me everything you saw

540
00:49:22,313 --> 00:49:25,406
And what you think it means.

541
00:49:36,927 --> 00:49:38,970
Yeach?

542
00:49:39,012 --> 00:49:40,011
The name on the second floor

543
00:49:40,062 --> 00:49:43,145
Rear mail box reads, 'Mr and Mrs Lars'.

544
00:49:43,186 --> 00:49:46,279
That's L-a-r-s.

545
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,361
Lars Thorwald.

546
00:49:48,410 --> 00:49:49,413
What's the number of the apartment?

547
00:49:49,453 --> 00:49:52,537
125 West Ninth Street.

548
00:49:53,626 --> 00:49:54,628
Thank you, dear.

549
00:49:54,668 --> 00:49:57,761
OK, chief. What's my next assignment?

550
00:49:57,801 --> 00:49:59,843
Just go home.

551
00:49:59,884 --> 00:50:02,978
'Alright, but what's he doing now?

552
00:50:03,016 --> 00:50:06,109
He's just sitting in the
living room in the dark.

553
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:09,243
Hasn't gone near the bedroom.

554
00:50:09,282 --> 00:50:12,368
Now you go home and get some sleep.
Good night.

555
00:50:12,408 --> 00:50:15,501
Good night.

556
00:50:22,849 --> 00:50:24,891
What's it about, Jeff?

557
00:50:24,941 --> 00:50:28,025
Look, Doyle, I can't
tell you over the phone.

558
00:50:28,064 --> 00:50:30,116
You have to be here and
see the whole set-up.

559
00:50:30,156 --> 00:50:33,240
It's probably nothing.
It's just a little neighbourhood murder.

560
00:50:34,332 --> 00:50:37,415
Did you say murder?
Yes, as a matter of fact, I did.

561
00:50:37,465 --> 00:50:39,507
Oh, come now.

562
00:50:39,546 --> 00:50:41,589
My only thought was throwing a little
business your way, that's all.

563
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:44,723
I figured a detective would jump at
the chance of something to detect.

564
00:50:45,814 --> 00:50:46,815
I'm not working.
What?

565
00:50:46,854 --> 00:50:48,898
This happens to be my day off.

566
00:50:48,938 --> 00:50:52,030
I usually took my best
pictures on my day off.

567
00:50:52,072 --> 00:50:55,165
I'll drop by.
OK, Doyle. As soon as you can.

568
00:50:57,286 --> 00:50:59,338
Bless your heart, Stella.

569
00:50:59,378 --> 00:51:01,420
Gee whiz, look at this.

570
00:51:01,461 --> 00:51:03,513
I can't tell you what a
welcome sight this is.

571
00:51:03,554 --> 00:51:05,596
No wonder your husband still loves you.

572
00:51:05,635 --> 00:51:06,636
The police.
What?

573
00:51:06,686 --> 00:51:09,770
You called the police.
Well, not exactly.

574
00:51:09,809 --> 00:51:12,902
Not an official call.
It's an old friend of mine.

575
00:51:13,985 --> 00:51:17,079
An old, ornery friend of mine.

576
00:51:17,118 --> 00:51:20,211
Just where do you suppose he cut her up?

577
00:51:21,292 --> 00:51:24,385
Of course. The bathtub.

578
00:51:24,427 --> 00:51:27,520
That's the only place where he
could have washed away the blood.

579
00:51:37,990 --> 00:51:41,084
He better get that trunk out of
there before it starts to leak.

580
00:52:03,038 --> 00:52:06,131
Harry?

581
00:52:09,305 --> 00:52:12,389
Look, look, Mr Jefferies.

582
00:52:50,009 --> 00:52:52,051
I thought Doyle would be here
by the time the trunk left,

583
00:52:52,091 --> 00:52:54,143
Or I'd have called the police.
Now we're gonna lose it.

584
00:52:54,183 --> 00:52:56,225
Hold everything.
Don't do anything foolish.

585
00:52:56,267 --> 00:52:58,318
I'm just gonna get the name
off that freight truck.

586
00:52:58,358 --> 00:53:01,442
I'll keep an eye on the alley.

587
00:53:14,016 --> 00:53:17,098
Long distance.

588
00:53:41,145 --> 00:53:44,238
You didn't see the killing or the body.
How do you know there was a murder?

589
00:53:44,279 --> 00:53:47,371
Because everything this fellow's
done has been suspicious:

590
00:53:47,411 --> 00:53:50,496
Trips at night in the rain, knives
and saws and trunks with rope,

591
00:53:51,587 --> 00:53:53,629
And now this wife that
isn't there any more.

592
00:53:53,669 --> 00:53:55,720
I admit it all has a mysterious sound.

593
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:58,843
It could be any number of things.
Murder's the least possible.

594
00:53:59,936 --> 00:54:01,977
Doyle, don't tell me he's
an unemployed magician,

595
00:54:02,017 --> 00:54:04,070
Amusing the neighbourhood
with his sleight of hand.

596
00:54:04,111 --> 00:54:05,112
Don't tell me that.

597
00:54:05,151 --> 00:54:08,245
It's too obvious and stupid
a way to commit murder.

598
00:54:08,283 --> 00:54:09,285
In full view of 50 windows?

599
00:54:09,326 --> 00:54:12,419
0Then sit there smoking a cigar,
waiting for the police to pick him up.

600
00:54:12,458 --> 00:54:15,542
Alright, officer, do your duty.
Go over and pick him up.

601
00:54:15,592 --> 00:54:18,675
Jeff, you've got a lot
to learn about homicide.

602
00:54:18,716 --> 00:54:20,768
Why, morons have committed
murder so shrewdly,

603
00:54:20,809 --> 00:54:23,892
It's taken a hundred trained
police minds to catch them.

604
00:54:23,942 --> 00:54:27,025
That salesman wouldn't just
knock his wife off after dinner

605
00:54:27,064 --> 00:54:29,117
And toss her in the trunk
and put her in storage.

606
00:54:29,156 --> 00:54:31,199
I'll bet it's been done.

607
00:54:31,239 --> 00:54:34,333
Most everything's been done... Under panic.

608
00:54:34,374 --> 00:54:36,415
This is a thousand-to-one shot.

609
00:54:36,465 --> 00:54:39,548
He's still sitting around the apartment.
That man's not panicked.

610
00:54:39,588 --> 00:54:41,639
You think I made all this up?

611
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,723
Well, I think you saw something

612
00:54:43,763 --> 00:54:46,857
There's probably a very
simple explanation for.

613
00:54:46,896 --> 00:54:49,989
For instance?
Wife took a trip.

614
00:54:50,030 --> 00:54:53,123
His wife was sick in bed.

615
00:54:53,163 --> 00:54:56,247
Yeach, so you told me.

616
00:54:56,286 --> 00:54:59,381
Well, Jeff, I've got to run along.

617
00:55:00,462 --> 00:55:03,556
I won't report this to the department.
Let me poke into it a little on my own.

618
00:55:05,687 --> 00:55:08,770
No sense in your getting a
lot of ridiculous publicity.

619
00:55:08,811 --> 00:55:11,903
Thank you.

620
00:55:11,944 --> 00:55:15,038
We know the wife is gone, so I'll
see if I can find out where.

621
00:55:15,077 --> 00:55:17,119
Do that.

622
00:55:17,169 --> 00:55:20,252
You had any headaches lately?

623
00:55:20,293 --> 00:55:22,344
Not till you showed up.

624
00:55:22,385 --> 00:55:25,469
It will wear off, along
with the hallucinations.

625
00:55:25,519 --> 00:55:28,602
See you around.

626
00:55:51,607 --> 00:55:54,690
Get along.

627
00:56:14,562 --> 00:56:15,573
He has a six months lease.

628
00:56:15,614 --> 00:56:18,697
Used up a little more than
five and a half months of it.

629
00:56:18,737 --> 00:56:21,830
He's quiet, drinks, but not to drunkenness.

630
00:56:21,870 --> 00:56:22,871
Pays his bills promptly with money earned

631
00:56:22,912 --> 00:56:26,004
As a costume jewellery salesman: wholesale.

632
00:56:26,045 --> 00:56:29,139
Kept to himself. No neighbours
got close to him or his wife.

633
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:31,221
Yeach, well, I think they
missed their chance with her.

634
00:56:31,271 --> 00:56:34,353
She never left the apartment,
until yesterday morning.

635
00:56:34,393 --> 00:56:36,446
What time?
6:00am.

636
00:56:36,485 --> 00:56:38,528
6:00am.

637
00:56:38,569 --> 00:56:41,662
I think that's about the
time I fell asleep.

638
00:56:41,701 --> 00:56:43,744
Too bad.

639
00:56:43,794 --> 00:56:46,878
Thorwalds were leaving their
apartment at just that time.

640
00:56:49,009 --> 00:56:51,052
Feel a little foolish?

641
00:56:51,091 --> 00:56:54,185
No, not yet.

642
00:57:03,615 --> 00:57:06,708
How's your wife?
Oh, she's fine.

643
00:57:10,923 --> 00:57:12,965
Who said they left then?

644
00:57:13,015 --> 00:57:16,098
W-Who left where?
The Thorwalds, at 6:00am.

645
00:57:16,139 --> 00:57:19,232
Oh, the building superintendent
and two tenants.

646
00:57:19,272 --> 00:57:22,366
Flat statements, no hesitation.
They jived with the letter.

647
00:57:22,405 --> 00:57:25,499
Thorwalds were on their way
to the railroad station.

648
00:57:25,539 --> 00:57:28,622
Well, now, Tom, how could
anybody possibly guess that?

649
00:57:28,663 --> 00:57:30,715
What, did they have signs
on their luggage saying,

650
00:57:30,755 --> 00:57:32,797
'Grand Central, or bust'?

651
00:57:32,837 --> 00:57:35,930
The superintendent met
Thorwald on his way back.

652
00:57:35,971 --> 00:57:39,065
Thorwald told him that he'd put his
wife on a train to the country.

653
00:57:39,104 --> 00:57:42,197
I see. I'd say this is a pretty
convenient guy, this superintendent.

654
00:57:42,237 --> 00:57:45,320
Have you checked his
bank statements lately?

655
00:57:46,411 --> 00:57:49,496
Huh?
Well, what good's his information?

656
00:57:50,587 --> 00:57:53,671
It's a secondhand version of an
unsupported story by the murderer.

657
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:57,844
Now did anybody actually see
the wife get on the train?

658
00:57:58,935 --> 00:57:59,938
I hate to remind you,

659
00:57:59,978 --> 00:58:03,070
But this all started because
you said she was murdered.

660
00:58:03,111 --> 00:58:05,152
Now, did anyone, including you,
actually see her murdered?

661
00:58:05,192 --> 00:58:08,285
What are you doing?

662
00:58:08,326 --> 00:58:11,419
Are you interested in solving this
case or making me look foolish?

663
00:58:12,501 --> 00:58:14,541
Well, if possible, both.

664
00:58:14,592 --> 00:58:15,593
Then do a good job of it.

665
00:58:15,634 --> 00:58:17,676
Go over there and search
Thorwald's apartment.

666
00:58:17,715 --> 00:58:19,768
It must be knee-deep in evidence.

667
00:58:19,809 --> 00:58:20,811
I can't do that.

668
00:58:20,849 --> 00:58:23,943
I don't mean right now, but
when he goes out for a drink,

669
00:58:23,983 --> 00:58:26,025
Or a paper, or something.
What he doesn't know won't hurt him.

670
00:58:26,066 --> 00:58:28,117
I can't do that even if he isn't there.

671
00:58:28,157 --> 00:58:30,200
What's he...

672
00:58:30,241 --> 00:58:33,334
Does he have a courtesy card from
the police department or something?

673
00:58:33,373 --> 00:58:35,425
Now don't get me mad.

674
00:58:35,465 --> 00:58:38,549
Not even a detective can walk
into an apartment and search it.

675
00:58:38,589 --> 00:58:41,682
If I were caught in there, they'd
have my badge within ten minutes.

676
00:58:41,723 --> 00:58:43,775
Make sure you don't get caught, that's all.

677
00:58:43,816 --> 00:58:46,898
If you find something,
you've got a murderer,

678
00:58:46,937 --> 00:58:48,990
And they don't care about
a couple of house rules.

679
00:58:49,030 --> 00:58:51,072
If you don't find anything,
the fellow's clear.

680
00:58:51,113 --> 00:58:53,165
At the risk of sounding stuffy,

681
00:58:53,206 --> 00:58:56,299
I'd like to remind you of the
Constitution and the phrase,

682
00:58:56,338 --> 00:58:59,422
'search warrant issued by a judge who
knows the Bill of Rights verbatim.

683
00:59:00,512 --> 00:59:03,596
He must ask for evidence.
Give him evidence.

684
00:59:05,729 --> 00:59:07,771
Yeach, I can hear myself,

685
00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:10,904
Your Honour, I have a friend
who's an amateur sleuth.

686
00:59:13,036 --> 00:59:16,119
The other night, after
having a heavy dinner, he...

687
00:59:16,169 --> 00:59:19,252
He'd throw the New York State
penal code in my face,

688
00:59:19,292 --> 00:59:21,345
And there's six volumes.

689
00:59:21,386 --> 00:59:24,469
By tomorrow morning there may
not be any evidence left

690
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:26,561
Over in that apartment, you know that.

691
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:28,643
It's a detective's nightmare.

692
00:59:28,693 --> 00:59:31,776
What do you need before you can search?

693
00:59:31,817 --> 00:59:32,817
Tell me now, what do you need?

694
00:59:32,868 --> 00:59:35,952
Bloody footsteps leading up to the door?

695
00:59:35,991 --> 00:59:39,085
One thing I don't need is heckling.
You called me and asked for help.

696
00:59:39,125 --> 00:59:42,218
Now you're behaving like a taxpayer.

697
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:45,352
How did we ever stand
each other in that plane

698
00:59:45,393 --> 00:59:48,475
For three years during the war?

699
00:59:48,516 --> 00:59:50,567
I guess I'll go over to
the railroad station

700
00:59:50,607 --> 00:59:52,649
And check on Thorwald's story.

701
00:59:52,690 --> 00:59:53,701
Oh, forget about the story.

702
00:59:53,741 --> 00:59:56,824
Find the trunk. Mrs Thorwald's in it.

703
00:59:56,864 --> 00:59:58,918
Oh, I almost forgot.

704
00:59:58,957 --> 01:00:02,050
There was a postcard in
Thorwald's mailbox. It was...

705
01:00:02,091 --> 01:00:05,174
Mailed 3:30 yesterday
afternoon from Merritsville.

706
01:00:05,214 --> 01:00:07,265
That's 80 miles north of here.

707
01:00:07,305 --> 01:00:09,347
Message went: Arrived OK.

708
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:12,481
Already feeling better. Love, Anna.'

709
01:00:15,655 --> 01:00:18,748
Uh... Is that, um...

710
01:00:18,787 --> 01:00:21,870
Anna... Is that who I think it is?

711
01:00:22,962 --> 01:00:26,046
Mrs Thorwald.
Uh-huh.

712
01:00:28,179 --> 01:00:30,220
Oh, so anything you need, Jeff?

713
01:00:30,270 --> 01:00:33,354
You might send me a good detective.

714
01:04:19,870 --> 01:04:22,964
Hello? Yes?
Hello, Miss Doyle?

715
01:04:23,005 --> 01:04:25,047
This is Jeff again. Has Tom come in yet?

716
01:04:25,097 --> 01:04:26,098
Not yet, Jeff.

717
01:04:26,137 --> 01:04:28,179
You mean you haven't even heard from him?

718
01:04:28,220 --> 01:04:31,312
Not a word. Is it something
really important, Jeff?

719
01:04:31,353 --> 01:04:33,396
Yeach, I'm afraid it is.

720
01:04:33,447 --> 01:04:35,488
I'll have him call the
moment I hear from him.

721
01:04:35,528 --> 01:04:37,580
No, no, don't bother to do that.

722
01:04:37,619 --> 01:04:39,662
Just have him get over
here as soon as he can.

723
01:04:39,703 --> 01:04:41,754
Looks like Thorwald's pulling out tonight.

724
01:04:41,793 --> 01:04:43,835
Who's Thorwald?
He'll know, he'll know.

725
01:04:43,877 --> 01:04:45,930
And Thorwald's a man, don't worry.

726
01:04:45,970 --> 01:04:49,053
Good night, you idiot.
Good night.

727
01:05:05,801 --> 01:05:08,885
Long distance again.

728
01:05:44,412 --> 01:05:47,496
There's somebody at the door.

729
01:05:49,628 --> 01:05:52,721
Hi.
Hello.

730
01:06:13,635 --> 01:06:16,728
Hello.

731
01:06:18,850 --> 01:06:20,903
What'd you do to your hair?
Oh, I just -

732
01:06:20,943 --> 01:06:24,026
Take a look at Thorwald.
He's getting ready to pull out.

733
01:06:28,251 --> 01:06:30,293
He doesn't seem to be in any hurry.

734
01:06:30,333 --> 01:06:32,376
He's been laying out all his
things on one of the beds:

735
01:06:32,425 --> 01:06:35,508
Shirts, suits, coats, socks.

736
01:06:35,548 --> 01:06:38,641
Even that alligator handbag
his wife left on the bedpost.

737
01:06:39,723 --> 01:06:42,816
He had it hidden in the dresser.
At least, it was there.

738
01:06:42,856 --> 01:06:45,950
He took it out, went to the telephone
and made a long distance call.

739
01:06:47,031 --> 01:06:49,073
He had his wife's jewellery in the handbag.

740
01:06:49,124 --> 01:06:52,206
Seemed worried about it.
Asked someone's advice over the phone.

741
01:06:52,247 --> 01:06:54,299
Someone not his wife.

742
01:06:54,339 --> 01:06:56,381
Well, I never saw him ask her for advice.

743
01:06:56,420 --> 01:06:59,514
She volunteered plenty, but I
never saw him ask her for any.

744
01:07:09,997 --> 01:07:13,080
I wonder where he's going.
I don't know.

745
01:07:14,171 --> 01:07:17,255
Suppose he doesn't come back?
He'll be back. His things are there.

746
01:07:19,387 --> 01:07:22,479
I guess it's safe to put on lights.
No, not yet!

747
01:07:29,828 --> 01:07:32,912
OK, you can turn it on now.
He must have gone someplace to the right.

748
01:07:36,084 --> 01:07:39,178
All day long, I've been trying
to keep my mind on my work.

749
01:07:39,218 --> 01:07:42,302
Thinking about Thorwald?
And you, and your friend, Doyle.

750
01:07:43,393 --> 01:07:46,476
Did you hear from him since he left?
Not a word.

751
01:07:46,526 --> 01:07:49,609
He said he was gonna check the
railroad station and the trunk.

752
01:07:49,650 --> 01:07:51,701
He must be still at it.

753
01:07:51,742 --> 01:07:54,825
Something on your mind?

754
01:07:54,875 --> 01:07:57,958
It doesn't make sense to me.
What doesn't?

755
01:07:57,998 --> 01:08:01,091
Women aren't that unpredictable.

756
01:08:01,133 --> 01:08:04,226
Hmm. Well, I can't guess
what you're thinking.

757
01:08:05,307 --> 01:08:08,400
A woman has a favourite handbag,

758
01:08:08,439 --> 01:08:11,523
And it always hangs on her bedpost
where she can get at it easily.

759
01:08:12,615 --> 01:08:15,697
Then, all of a sudden, she goes away
on a trip and leaves it behind. Why?

760
01:08:15,748 --> 01:08:17,790
Because she didn't know
she was going on a trip,

761
01:08:17,830 --> 01:08:19,883
And where she's going, she
wouldn't need the handbag.

762
01:08:19,922 --> 01:08:23,006
Yes, but only her husband would know that.

763
01:08:24,096 --> 01:08:25,638
And that jewellery

764
01:08:25,639 --> 01:08:27,180
- Women don't keep their
jewellery in a purse

765
01:08:27,219 --> 01:08:30,314
Getting all twisted and
scratched and tangled up.

766
01:08:30,353 --> 01:08:31,354
Well, do they hide it in
their husband's clothes?

767
01:08:31,395 --> 01:08:34,489
They do not.
And they don't leave it behind either.

768
01:08:36,620 --> 01:08:38,663
Why, a woman going
anywhere but the hospital

769
01:08:38,701 --> 01:08:41,796
Would always take make-up,
perfume and jewellery.

770
01:08:42,878 --> 01:08:44,929
Put that over there.
That's inside stuff, huh?

771
01:08:44,970 --> 01:08:47,012
It's basic equipment.

772
01:08:47,052 --> 01:08:50,145
And you don't leave it behind
in your husband's drawer

773
01:08:50,184 --> 01:08:51,185
In your favourite handbag.

774
01:08:51,226 --> 01:08:53,277
Well, I'm with you, sweetie. I'm with you.

775
01:08:53,319 --> 01:08:55,362
Tom Doyle has a pat answer for that though.

776
01:08:55,402 --> 01:08:58,495
That Mrs Thorwald left at 6:00am
yesterday with her husband?

777
01:08:58,535 --> 01:09:00,576
According to those witnesses.

778
01:09:00,626 --> 01:09:02,668
Well, I have a pat rebuttal for Mr Doyle.

779
01:09:02,708 --> 01:09:05,803
Couldn't have been Mrs Thorwald,
or I don't know women.

780
01:09:06,884 --> 01:09:09,977
What about the witnesses?
We'll agree they saw a woman,

781
01:09:12,099 --> 01:09:14,151
But she was not Mrs Thorwald.

782
01:09:14,192 --> 01:09:17,275
That is, not yet.
Is that so?

783
01:09:22,540 --> 01:09:25,623
Come here.

784
01:09:26,715 --> 01:09:29,798
I'd like to see your friend's
face when we tell him.

785
01:09:29,848 --> 01:09:32,932
He doesn't sound like much of a detective.

786
01:09:32,972 --> 01:09:36,065
Oh, don't be too hard on him.
He's a steady worker.

787
01:09:37,146 --> 01:09:39,198
I sure wish he'd show up.

788
01:09:39,239 --> 01:09:42,331
Don't rush him. We have all night.

789
01:09:45,496 --> 01:09:47,549
We have all what?
Night.

790
01:09:47,588 --> 01:09:50,681
I'm going to stay with you.

791
01:09:51,762 --> 01:09:54,855
Well, you'll have to clear
that with my landlord.

792
01:09:55,936 --> 01:09:59,031
I have the whole weekend off.

793
01:09:59,071 --> 01:10:02,154
That's very nice, but I just have one bed.

794
01:10:02,204 --> 01:10:05,286
If you say anything else, I'll...
Stay tomorrow night too.

795
01:10:07,419 --> 01:10:10,503
I won't be able to give you any... Pyjamas.

796
01:10:15,769 --> 01:10:18,852
You said I'll have to
live out of one suitcase.

797
01:10:20,984 --> 01:10:24,079
I'll bet yours isn't this small.
This is a suitcase?

798
01:10:25,159 --> 01:10:28,252
Well, a Mark Cross overnight case.

799
01:10:28,291 --> 01:10:31,376
Ooh.
Compact, but, uh... Ample enough.

800
01:10:31,425 --> 01:10:33,467
Looks like you packed in a hurry.

801
01:10:33,507 --> 01:10:36,601
Look at this. Isn't that amazing?

802
01:10:37,684 --> 01:10:40,774
I'll trade you... My feminine
intuition for a bed for the night.

803
01:10:41,857 --> 01:10:44,950
I'll go along with that.

804
01:10:58,555 --> 01:11:01,648
There's that song again.

805
01:11:06,904 --> 01:11:09,999
Where does a man get inspiration
to write a song like that?

806
01:11:11,079 --> 01:11:14,172
Well, he gets it from the
landlady once a month.

807
01:11:16,304 --> 01:11:19,387
It's utterly beautiful.

808
01:11:19,428 --> 01:11:22,522
I wish I could be creative.
Oh, sweetie, you are.

809
01:11:23,602 --> 01:11:26,696
Y-Y-You have a great talent for
creating difficult situations.

810
01:11:27,777 --> 01:11:28,778
I do?
Sure.

811
01:11:28,830 --> 01:11:30,871
Like staying here all night uninvited.

812
01:11:30,911 --> 01:11:34,004
Well, surprise is the most
important element of attack.

813
01:11:35,085 --> 01:11:38,178
Besides, you're not up on
your private eye literature.

814
01:11:38,218 --> 01:11:40,260
When they're in trouble, it's
always their Girl Friday

815
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:41,302
That gets them out of it.

816
01:11:41,352 --> 01:11:44,436
Is she the girl that saves
them from the clutches

817
01:11:44,475 --> 01:11:47,568
Of the over-passionate
daughters of the rich?

818
01:11:47,609 --> 01:11:50,701
The same.
That's the one, huh?

819
01:11:50,742 --> 01:11:53,825
It's funny. He never ends
up marrying her, does he?

820
01:11:53,875 --> 01:11:56,958
That's strange.
Weird.

821
01:11:59,091 --> 01:12:01,133
Why don't I slip into
something more comfortable?

822
01:12:01,174 --> 01:12:03,226
By all means.

823
01:12:03,266 --> 01:12:06,358
I mean, like the kitchen
and make us some coffee.

824
01:12:06,398 --> 01:12:09,481
Oh, and some brandy too, huh?

825
01:12:18,922 --> 01:12:22,006
Harry.

826
01:12:29,354 --> 01:12:32,447
Jeff.
Hi.

827
01:13:22,581 --> 01:13:24,634
What else have you got
on this man Thorwald?

828
01:13:24,674 --> 01:13:27,757
Enough to scare me you wouldn't
show up in time and we'd lose him.

829
01:13:28,849 --> 01:13:30,890
Think he's getting out of here?
He's got everything he owns

830
01:13:30,931 --> 01:13:34,025
Laid out over there in the
bedroom, waiting to be packed.

831
01:13:36,157 --> 01:13:39,240
I'm just warming some brandy.
Mr Doyle, I presume?

832
01:13:42,414 --> 01:13:45,508
Tom, this is Miss Lisa Fremont.

833
01:13:45,547 --> 01:13:48,631
How do you do?
We think Thorwald's guilty.

834
01:13:55,979 --> 01:13:59,072
Careful, Tom.

835
01:14:03,286 --> 01:14:04,287
Hello.
Lieutenant Doyle.

836
01:14:04,328 --> 01:14:07,420
Yeach, he's right here. For you.

837
01:14:07,461 --> 01:14:09,502
Hello.
Lieutenant Doyle, sir?

838
01:14:09,554 --> 01:14:12,637
Speaking. Yeach.

839
01:14:14,769 --> 01:14:16,811
Alright.

840
01:14:16,851 --> 01:14:19,946
I see. Thank you... Goodbye.

841
01:14:19,984 --> 01:14:22,026
Coffee will be ready soon.

842
01:14:22,077 --> 01:14:24,119
Jeff, aren't you going to
tell him about the jewellery?

843
01:14:24,158 --> 01:14:26,211
Jewellery?

844
01:14:26,252 --> 01:14:29,335
He's got his wife's jewellery hidden
in his clothes in the bedroom there.

845
01:14:29,375 --> 01:14:32,469
You sure it belonged to his wife?
It was in her favourite handbag.

846
01:14:32,509 --> 01:14:35,601
Mr Doyle, that can only
lead to one conclusion.

847
01:14:35,642 --> 01:14:36,643
Namely?

848
01:14:36,683 --> 01:14:39,776
That it was not Mrs Thorwald that
left with him yesterday morning.

849
01:14:40,857 --> 01:14:41,858
You figured that out, eh?

850
01:14:41,899 --> 01:14:44,991
It's simply that women don't
leave their jewellery behind

851
01:14:45,031 --> 01:14:47,083
When they go on a trip.

852
01:14:47,124 --> 01:14:50,208
Come on, Tom. You don't really need
any of this information, do you?

853
01:14:57,556 --> 01:15:00,648
As a matter of fact, I don't.

854
01:15:05,903 --> 01:15:08,998
Lars Thorwald is no more
a murderer than I am.

855
01:15:13,212 --> 01:15:16,306
You can explain everything
that's going on over there?

856
01:15:17,388 --> 01:15:19,430
No, and neither can you.

857
01:15:19,479 --> 01:15:22,563
That's a secret, private world
you're looking into out there.

858
01:15:22,603 --> 01:15:24,655
People do a lot of things in private
they couldn't do in public.

859
01:15:24,695 --> 01:15:26,737
Like disposing of their wives?

860
01:15:26,776 --> 01:15:29,871
Get that idea out of your mind.
It'll only lead in the wrong direction.

861
01:15:29,911 --> 01:15:33,004
What about the knife and the saw?

862
01:15:33,044 --> 01:15:36,127
Did you ever own a saw?
Well, at home in the garage I had -

863
01:15:37,218 --> 01:15:39,259
How many people did you cut up with it?

864
01:15:39,301 --> 01:15:42,395
Or with the couple hundred knives
you've owned in your lifetime?

865
01:15:44,527 --> 01:15:46,569
0Your logic is backward.

866
01:15:46,609 --> 01:15:49,703
You can't ignore the disappearance
and the trunk and the jewellery.

867
01:15:49,742 --> 01:15:52,836
I checked the railroad station.
He bought a ticket.

868
01:15:52,877 --> 01:15:54,918
Ten minutes later, he put
his wife on the train.

869
01:15:54,958 --> 01:15:58,051
Destination: Merritsville.
The witnesses are that deep.

870
01:15:58,090 --> 01:16:01,185
That might have been a woman, but
it couldn't have been Mrs Thorwald.

871
01:16:01,224 --> 01:16:03,268
That jewellery
Look, Miss Fremont.

872
01:16:03,308 --> 01:16:06,399
That feminine intuition
stuff sells magazines

873
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:09,534
But in real life, it's still a fairy tale.

874
01:16:09,574 --> 01:16:10,575
I don't know how many
wasted years I've spent,

875
01:16:10,616 --> 01:16:13,709
Tracking down leads based
on female intuition.

876
01:16:13,748 --> 01:16:15,791
Alright! I take it you
didn't find the trunk.

877
01:16:15,831 --> 01:16:18,923
All this is from an old speech you
made at the policemen's ball.

878
01:16:20,005 --> 01:16:22,058
I found the trunk a half-hour
after I left here.

879
01:16:22,098 --> 01:16:25,180
I suppose it's normal for a man to
tie up a trunk with heavy rope?

880
01:16:26,272 --> 01:16:28,314
If the lock is broken, yes.

881
01:16:28,354 --> 01:16:31,447
What did you find inside the
trunk, a surly note to me?

882
01:16:31,487 --> 01:16:33,529
Mrs Thorwald's clothes;

883
01:16:33,581 --> 01:16:36,664
Clean, well-packed, not
stylish, but presentable.

884
01:16:36,704 --> 01:16:38,755
Didn't you take them off to the crime lab?

885
01:16:38,796 --> 01:16:41,878
I sent them on their merry and legal way.

886
01:16:41,929 --> 01:16:45,012
Why, when a woman is taking
a simple, short trip,

887
01:16:45,052 --> 01:16:47,106
Does she take everything she owns?

888
01:16:47,146 --> 01:16:50,229
Let's let the female psychology
department handle that one.

889
01:16:51,319 --> 01:16:54,412
I would say it looked as
if she wasn't coming back.

890
01:16:54,453 --> 01:16:56,496
That's what's known as a family problem.

891
01:16:56,535 --> 01:16:58,586
If she wasn't coming back, why
didn't he tell his landlord?

892
01:16:58,627 --> 01:17:00,669
I'll tell you why he
didn't tell his landlord,

893
01:17:00,709 --> 01:17:03,803
Because he was hiding something.

894
01:17:05,925 --> 01:17:07,979
Do you tell your landlord everything?

895
01:17:08,017 --> 01:17:10,059
Ah, I told you to be careful, Tom.

896
01:17:10,098 --> 01:17:13,193
If I'd have been careful piloting
that reconnaissance plane

897
01:17:13,235 --> 01:17:15,286
You wouldn't have had the
chance to take the pictures

898
01:17:15,326 --> 01:17:18,409
That won you a medal, and a
good job, and fame, and money.

899
01:17:21,582 --> 01:17:24,675
What do you say, we all sit down
and have a nice friendly drink.

900
01:17:26,808 --> 01:17:28,850
Forget all about this.

901
01:17:28,891 --> 01:17:31,984
We can tell lies about the
good old days during the war.

902
01:17:34,106 --> 01:17:36,157
You mean you're through with the case?

903
01:17:36,198 --> 01:17:39,282
There is no case to be
through with, Miss Fremont.

904
01:17:39,332 --> 01:17:42,416
How about that drink?

905
01:17:48,721 --> 01:17:51,805
Yeach, I guess you're right.

906
01:17:51,855 --> 01:17:54,937
Well, I think I better get
home and get some sleep.

907
01:17:57,071 --> 01:18:00,154
Cheers.

908
01:18:01,245 --> 01:18:04,329
I, uh... I'm not much of a snifter.

909
01:18:09,594 --> 01:18:12,687
Oh, Jeff, if you need any more help...

910
01:18:12,728 --> 01:18:15,811
Consult the Yellow Pages in
your telephone directory.

911
01:18:16,904 --> 01:18:19,986
Oh, I love funny exiting lines.

912
01:18:20,026 --> 01:18:23,119
Who was that trunk addressed to?
Mrs Anna Thorwald.

913
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:26,252
Then let's wait and find
out who picks it up.

914
01:18:26,293 --> 01:18:28,335
Oh, that phone call, I
gave them your number.

915
01:18:28,374 --> 01:18:31,469
I hope you don't mind.
Depends on who they were.

916
01:18:31,510 --> 01:18:33,561
The police at Merritsville.

917
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:35,642
They reported the trunk
was just picked up...

918
01:18:35,683 --> 01:18:38,777
By Mrs Anna Thorwald.

919
01:18:38,816 --> 01:18:41,911
Don't stay up too late.

920
01:18:59,688 --> 01:19:02,782
Look.
What?

921
01:19:33,086 --> 01:19:36,179
Yeach, he's kind of young, isn't he?

922
01:20:11,708 --> 01:20:14,791
What are you doing?

923
01:20:39,878 --> 01:20:42,971
You know, much as I hate to give
Thomas J Doyle too much credit,

924
01:20:44,053 --> 01:20:47,147
He might have gotten ahold
of something when he said

925
01:20:47,187 --> 01:20:50,278
That was pretty private
stuff going on out there.

926
01:20:51,362 --> 01:20:54,455
I wonder if it's ethical to watch a man

927
01:20:54,494 --> 01:20:57,588
With binoculars and a long-focus lens.

928
01:20:58,669 --> 01:21:00,711
Do you...

929
01:21:00,761 --> 01:21:03,845
Do you suppose it's ethical, even if you
prove that he didn't commit a crime?

930
01:21:07,019 --> 01:21:09,061
I'm not much on rear window ethics.

931
01:21:09,110 --> 01:21:11,152
Of course, they can do
the same thing to me,

932
01:21:11,193 --> 01:21:14,286
Watch me like a bug under
a glass, if they want to.

933
01:21:14,326 --> 01:21:17,409
Jeff, if someone came in here, they
wouldn't believe what they'd see.

934
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:20,541
What?
You and me with long faces,

935
01:21:20,583 --> 01:21:23,677
Plunged into despair because we find
out a man didn't kill his wife.

936
01:21:24,757 --> 01:21:27,851
We're two of the most frightening
ghouls I've ever known.

937
01:21:28,931 --> 01:21:32,025
You'd think we could be a bit happy
that the poor woman is alive and well.

938
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:39,333
Whatever happened to that old
saying, Love thy neighbour'?

939
01:21:41,456 --> 01:21:44,549
You know, I think I'll start
reviving that tomorrow.

940
01:21:45,630 --> 01:21:48,723
Yeach, I'll begin with Miss Torso.

941
01:21:48,763 --> 01:21:51,858
Not if I have to move into an
apartment across the way...

942
01:21:55,030 --> 01:21:58,114
And do the Dance of the
Seven Veils' every hour.

943
01:22:00,246 --> 01:22:03,339
Show's over for tonight.

944
01:22:07,553 --> 01:22:10,637
Preview of coming attractions.

945
01:22:12,770 --> 01:22:15,863
Did Mr Doyle think I stole this case?

946
01:22:16,945 --> 01:22:20,036
No, Lisa, I don't think he did.

947
01:22:34,683 --> 01:22:37,777
What do you think?
Well, uh...

948
01:22:38,859 --> 01:22:41,952
I will rephrase the question.
Thank you.

949
01:22:43,033 --> 01:22:46,127
Do you like it?

950
01:22:46,166 --> 01:22:49,260
Yes, I like it.
Well -

951
01:22:58,690 --> 01:23:01,783
What's the matter?

952
01:23:02,864 --> 01:23:04,916
Somebody's hurt?
lt's the dog.

953
01:23:04,957 --> 01:23:08,041
Something's happened to the dog.

954
01:23:11,213 --> 01:23:14,307
Somebody fall out a window?

955
01:23:14,346 --> 01:23:17,440
I think it's a dog.

956
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:20,563
It's dead. It's been strangled.
Its neck is broken.

957
01:23:23,737 --> 01:23:24,737
Which one of you did it?

958
01:23:24,787 --> 01:23:27,872
Which one of you killed my dog?

959
01:23:27,911 --> 01:23:31,004
You don't know the meaning
of the word neighbours'.

960
01:23:32,085 --> 01:23:34,138
Neighbours like each other,

961
01:23:34,178 --> 01:23:37,261
Speak to each other, care
if anybody lives or dies!

962
01:23:39,393 --> 01:23:42,488
But none of you do!

963
01:23:45,661 --> 01:23:47,703
But I couldn't imagine
any of you being so low

964
01:23:47,743 --> 01:23:50,837
That you'd kill a helpless, friendly dog.

965
01:23:52,958 --> 01:23:56,050
The only thing in this whole
neighbourhood who liked anybody!

966
01:24:05,482 --> 01:24:08,576
Did you kill him because he liked you?
Just because he liked you?

967
01:24:13,831 --> 01:24:16,924
Let's go inside.

968
01:24:19,058 --> 01:24:22,142
Come on. Let's go back in.
It's only a dog.

969
01:24:33,663 --> 01:24:36,756
You know, for a minute, that
Tom Doyle almost had me

970
01:24:36,796 --> 01:24:37,796
Convinced I was wrong.

971
01:24:37,836 --> 01:24:39,889
But you're not?
Look.

972
01:24:39,931 --> 01:24:43,013
In the courtyard, only one person
didn't come to the window. Look.

973
01:24:51,413 --> 01:24:54,496
Why would Thorwald want
to kill a little dog?

974
01:24:56,628 --> 01:24:59,711
Because it knew too much?

975
01:25:07,060 --> 01:25:10,152
You think this is worth
waiting all day to see?

976
01:25:10,193 --> 01:25:11,193
Is he cleaning house?

977
01:25:11,234 --> 01:25:14,326
He's washing down the bathroom walls.

978
01:25:14,367 --> 01:25:17,461
Hm, must have splattered a lot.

979
01:25:19,582 --> 01:25:21,635
Well, why not?
That's what we're all thinking.

980
01:25:21,675 --> 01:25:24,758
He killed her in there, he has
to clean up those stains.

981
01:25:24,810 --> 01:25:27,893
Oh, Stella, your choice of words.

982
01:25:27,932 --> 01:25:31,026
Nobody ever invented a polite
word for a killing yet.

983
01:25:34,199 --> 01:25:37,293
Lisa, back there on that shelf, there's
a little yellow box, you see it?

984
01:25:39,415 --> 01:25:41,466
Top one?
Right on top, yeach.

985
01:25:41,507 --> 01:25:44,590
And bring me the viewer there.

986
01:25:45,682 --> 01:25:48,764
I just got a...
These are about two weeks old.

987
01:25:50,897 --> 01:25:52,444
I hope I took something
else besides leg art.

988
01:25:52,445 --> 01:25:53,991
Now which one...

989
01:25:54,031 --> 01:25:57,115
What are you looking for?

990
01:25:57,165 --> 01:26:00,247
There's something, and if I'm right,
I think I've solved a murder.

991
01:26:00,288 --> 01:26:03,382
Mrs Thorwald?
No.

992
01:26:03,421 --> 01:26:06,514
No, the dog.

993
01:26:06,555 --> 01:26:09,638
Uh-huh. I think I know why
Thorwald killed that dog.

994
01:26:11,771 --> 01:26:14,864
Here, now you take a look.
Tell me what you see.

995
01:26:14,904 --> 01:26:16,946
Now take it down.

996
01:26:16,986 --> 01:26:19,038
Now look again.

997
01:26:19,077 --> 01:26:22,161
Now take it down. You see?

998
01:26:23,252 --> 01:26:24,255
It's just a picture of the backyard -

999
01:26:24,295 --> 01:26:27,387
But with one important change.
One important change.

1000
01:26:29,509 --> 01:26:32,601
Those flowers in Thorwald's pet flower bed.

1001
01:26:33,683 --> 01:26:35,737
You mean where the dog was sniffing around?

1002
01:26:35,777 --> 01:26:38,860
Where the dog was digging.
Now look at those flowers.

1003
01:26:38,910 --> 01:26:41,993
Look, those two yellow zinnias on this end

1004
01:26:43,085 --> 01:26:45,127
Aren't as tall as they were.

1005
01:26:45,166 --> 01:26:48,260
Since when do flowers grow
shorter in two weeks?

1006
01:26:48,301 --> 01:26:51,394
There's something buried there.
Mrs Thorwald.

1007
01:26:52,474 --> 01:26:55,568
You haven't spent much time
around cemeteries, have you?

1008
01:26:55,608 --> 01:26:58,691
Mr Thorwald could scarcely
put his wife's body

1009
01:26:58,731 --> 01:27:01,825
In a plot of ground about one foot square.

1010
01:27:01,865 --> 01:27:04,958
Unless, of course, he put
her in standing on end,

1011
01:27:04,998 --> 01:27:08,091
And then he wouldn't need a knife and saw.

1012
01:27:08,132 --> 01:27:11,214
No, my idea is she's
scattered all over town.

1013
01:27:11,264 --> 01:27:14,348
Leg in the East River
Oh, Stella, please!

1014
01:27:14,389 --> 01:27:15,390
No, no, no. There's something in there.

1015
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:18,522
Those flowers have been
taken out and put back in.

1016
01:27:18,563 --> 01:27:19,563
Maybe it's the knife and saw.
Yeach -

1017
01:27:19,614 --> 01:27:22,696
Call Lieutenant Doyle.
No, let's wait.

1018
01:27:22,737 --> 01:27:25,830
Let's wait till it gets a little darker,
and I'll go over there and dig them up.

1019
01:27:25,870 --> 01:27:28,964
You'll go? You won't dig anything
up and get your neck broken.

1020
01:27:31,086 --> 01:27:33,140
No, no, we've...

1021
01:27:33,179 --> 01:27:36,263
0We're not gonna call Doyle until I
can produce Mrs Thorwald's body.

1022
01:27:36,311 --> 01:27:39,395
What we've got to do is find a
way to get into that apartment.

1023
01:27:39,435 --> 01:27:41,489
He's packing.

1024
01:27:41,528 --> 01:27:43,570
Uh-oh.

1025
01:27:43,610 --> 01:27:46,703
Here, get me a pencil.

1026
01:27:46,744 --> 01:27:49,836
Stella, get me some note paper.
It's up here someplace.

1027
01:27:49,877 --> 01:27:52,959
There it is.

1028
01:29:08,152 --> 01:29:11,247
You did it, Thorwald. You did it.

1029
01:29:14,409 --> 01:29:16,461
Look out, Lisa. He's coming.
You never should have let her do it.

1030
01:29:16,502 --> 01:29:19,594
If he ever
Look. Look. Look.

1031
01:29:37,374 --> 01:29:40,467
Thank heaven that's over.

1032
01:29:44,682 --> 01:29:47,766
Alright if I have a drink?
Sure, go ahead.

1033
01:29:56,164 --> 01:29:59,248
There's no doubt about it. He's leaving.
Lt's just a question of when.

1034
01:30:00,339 --> 01:30:03,422
Mind if I use that portable keyhole?

1035
01:30:04,513 --> 01:30:07,597
Go ahead, just as long as you
tell me what you're looking at.

1036
01:30:13,904 --> 01:30:16,986
I wonder...
Wonder what?

1037
01:30:17,036 --> 01:30:19,080
Miss Lonelyhearts just laid
out something that looks like

1038
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:21,162
Rhodium tri-eckonal capsules.

1039
01:30:21,213 --> 01:30:24,295
You can tell from here?
I've handled enough of those

1040
01:30:24,335 --> 01:30:27,429
To put everybody in Hackensack
to sleep for the winter.

1041
01:30:27,468 --> 01:30:30,562
Does she have enough of them to
To make her rest easier -

1042
01:30:30,602 --> 01:30:33,696
Wasn't that close?

1043
01:30:33,736 --> 01:30:36,819
What was his reaction when
he looked at the note?

1044
01:30:36,859 --> 01:30:38,911
lt wasn't the kind of
expression that would get him

1045
01:30:38,950 --> 01:30:40,993
A quick loan at the bank.

1046
01:30:41,033 --> 01:30:44,126
Jeff, the handbag!

1047
01:31:08,173 --> 01:31:11,266
Suppose Mrs Thorwald's wedding ring

1048
01:31:11,306 --> 01:31:13,349
Is among the jewellery
he has in that handbag?

1049
01:31:13,389 --> 01:31:16,482
Now, during the phone conversation
he held up three rings:

1050
01:31:16,523 --> 01:31:19,615
One with a diamond, one with
a big stone of some sort,

1051
01:31:19,655 --> 01:31:21,698
And then just a plain gold band.

1052
01:31:21,737 --> 01:31:24,832
The last thing she would leave
behind would be her wedding ring.

1053
01:31:25,913 --> 01:31:27,965
Stella, do you ever leave yours at home?

1054
01:31:28,005 --> 01:31:31,088
The only way anybody could get that
ring would be to chop off my finger.

1055
01:31:35,312 --> 01:31:38,395
Let's go down and find out
what's buried in the garden.

1056
01:31:39,487 --> 01:31:42,570
Why not? I've always wanted
to meet Mrs Thorwald.

1057
01:31:43,662 --> 01:31:45,703
What are you two talking about
You got a shovel?

1058
01:31:45,744 --> 01:31:46,745
Of course I don't have a shovel.

1059
01:31:46,786 --> 01:31:49,879
There's probably one in the basement.
If you're squeamish, just don't look.

1060
01:31:50,959 --> 01:31:51,972
Squeamish? I'm not squeamish.

1061
01:31:52,012 --> 01:31:55,095
I just don't want you two
to end up like that dog.

1062
01:31:55,136 --> 01:31:58,227
Oh, you know, Miss Fremont, he
might just have something there.

1063
01:31:59,308 --> 01:32:01,362
Just hold on. Here, take this.

1064
01:32:01,401 --> 01:32:03,444
No sense taking any chances in this thing.

1065
01:32:03,494 --> 01:32:06,576
Here, give me the phone book.

1066
01:32:06,618 --> 01:32:08,669
What for?

1067
01:32:08,709 --> 01:32:10,751
Maybe I can get him out of that apartment.

1068
01:32:10,791 --> 01:32:12,843
We only need a few minutes.

1069
01:32:12,883 --> 01:32:14,926
I'll see if I can get about 15 minutes.

1070
01:32:14,965 --> 01:32:18,059
How?
Thorwald.

1071
01:32:18,100 --> 01:32:21,193
Thorwald... Thorwald.

1072
01:32:22,274 --> 01:32:25,366
Chelsea 2-7099.

1073
01:32:26,449 --> 01:32:28,491
2-7099.

1074
01:32:28,541 --> 01:32:31,625
We scared him once, maybe
we can scare him again.

1075
01:32:31,664 --> 01:32:34,757
I guess I'm using that
word 'we a little freely.

1076
01:32:34,796 --> 01:32:37,890
You're taking all the chances.

1077
01:32:37,931 --> 01:32:41,015
Shall we vote him in, Stella?
Unanimously.

1078
01:32:41,063 --> 01:32:44,146
2-7099. Look out.

1079
01:32:46,280 --> 01:32:49,364
Chelsea.

1080
01:32:49,414 --> 01:32:52,497
Chelsea.

1081
01:33:09,234 --> 01:33:12,329
Go on, pick it up, Thorwald.

1082
01:33:12,369 --> 01:33:14,421
Go on, you're curious.

1083
01:33:14,460 --> 01:33:17,544
You wonder if it's your girlfriend
calling, the one you killed for.

1084
01:33:17,595 --> 01:33:20,678
Go on, pick it up.

1085
01:33:23,851 --> 01:33:26,944
Hello?
Did you get my note?

1086
01:33:30,117 --> 01:33:32,161
Well, did you get it, Thorwald?

1087
01:33:32,201 --> 01:33:33,202
Who are you?

1088
01:33:33,241 --> 01:33:35,292
I'll give you a chance to find out.

1089
01:33:35,333 --> 01:33:38,416
Meet me in the bar at the Albert Hotel.

1090
01:33:38,467 --> 01:33:40,508
Do it right away.

1091
01:33:40,550 --> 01:33:43,643
Why should I?
A little business meeting...

1092
01:33:43,683 --> 01:33:46,766
To settle the estate of your late wife.

1093
01:33:47,855 --> 01:33:50,939
I... Don't know what you mean.

1094
01:33:50,991 --> 01:33:53,033
Come on. Quit stalling, Thorwald,

1095
01:33:53,072 --> 01:33:55,115
Or I'll hang up and call the police.

1096
01:33:55,165 --> 01:33:58,249
I only have $100.
That's a start.

1097
01:34:00,380 --> 01:34:03,465
I'm at the Albert now.
I'll be looking for you.

1098
01:34:23,335 --> 01:34:24,346
Come on, Stella, let's go.

1099
01:34:24,385 --> 01:34:26,428
One of you keep an eye on this window.

1100
01:34:26,469 --> 01:34:29,562
If I see him coming back,
I'll signal with a flashbulb.

1101
01:36:04,576 --> 01:36:06,618
This is the Doyle residence.

1102
01:36:06,668 --> 01:36:09,750
Hello, this is L B Jefferies.
I'm a friend of Mr Doyle.

1103
01:36:10,843 --> 01:36:12,885
Who's this?
This is a baby-sitter.

1104
01:36:12,924 --> 01:36:16,018
Oh, uh... When do you expect them in?

1105
01:36:16,060 --> 01:36:19,142
They went to dinner and maybe a nightclub.

1106
01:36:21,274 --> 01:36:22,275
I see, hm.

1107
01:36:22,315 --> 01:36:25,409
If he calls in, have him get
in touch with L B Jefferies?

1108
01:36:26,491 --> 01:36:28,542
I might have quite a surprise for him.

1109
01:36:28,582 --> 01:36:31,675
Well, do we have your number, Mr Jefferies?

1110
01:36:31,716 --> 01:36:34,798
He has it. Good night.
Good night.

1111
01:36:51,537 --> 01:36:54,631
Ah, Stella was wrong
about Miss Lonelyhearts.

1112
01:37:28,067 --> 01:37:31,162
Lisa, what are you... Don't...

1113
01:37:35,374 --> 01:37:38,467
Don't...

1114
01:37:45,814 --> 01:37:48,899
Lisa, what are you doing? Don't go...

1115
01:38:04,597 --> 01:38:07,689
Li...

1116
01:38:23,388 --> 01:38:26,471
Come on, come on! Get out of there!

1117
01:38:31,737 --> 01:38:34,819
She said ring Thorwald's phone the
second you see him come back.

1118
01:38:35,912 --> 01:38:38,994
We'll ring right now!
Give her another minute.

1119
01:38:43,218 --> 01:38:45,261
Alright, fellows, let's try
it once from the beginning.

1120
01:38:45,301 --> 01:38:47,343
Miss Lonelyhearts.

1121
01:38:47,394 --> 01:38:50,476
Oh, call the police!

1122
01:38:52,609 --> 01:38:54,651
Operator.
Get me the police, sixth precinct.

1123
01:38:54,692 --> 01:38:57,784
Yes, sir.

1124
01:39:08,266 --> 01:39:11,349
Mr Jefferies, the music stopped her.

1125
01:39:18,696 --> 01:39:21,790
What... Lisa!

1126
01:39:21,832 --> 01:39:24,923
0Lisa!

1127
01:39:35,396 --> 01:39:37,447
Precinct Six, Sergeant Allgood.

1128
01:39:37,488 --> 01:39:40,570
Hello. Look, a man is assaulting a
woman at 125 West Ninth Street,

1129
01:39:41,663 --> 01:39:44,747
Second floor, at the rear.

1130
01:39:44,797 --> 01:39:46,838
Make it fast!

1131
01:39:46,878 --> 01:39:48,920
Your name?
L B Jefferies.

1132
01:39:48,970 --> 01:39:52,052
Phone number?
Chelsea 2-5598

1133
01:39:52,093 --> 01:39:55,188
Two minutes.

1134
01:40:12,966 --> 01:40:16,060
The door was open.

1135
01:40:29,664 --> 01:40:32,758
Oh...

1136
01:40:35,932 --> 01:40:39,025
I told you...
Oh, no!

1137
01:40:40,107 --> 01:40:42,147
Let go of me! Jeff!

1138
01:40:42,197 --> 01:40:45,281
Oh, no!
Jeff! Jeff!

1139
01:40:45,321 --> 01:40:48,416
Jeff!

1140
01:40:48,455 --> 01:40:50,498
Lisa!

1141
01:40:50,548 --> 01:40:53,630
Stella, what do we do?

1142
01:40:53,671 --> 01:40:56,764
Jeff! Jeff!
Here they come.

1143
01:41:47,940 --> 01:41:49,994
What's she trying to do?
Why doesn't she turn him in?

1144
01:41:50,033 --> 01:41:53,125
She's a smart girl.
Smart girl? She'll be arrested.

1145
01:41:53,166 --> 01:41:56,249
lt'll get her out of there, won't it?

1146
01:41:58,381 --> 01:42:01,475
Look, the wedding ring!

1147
01:42:05,689 --> 01:42:08,773
Turn off the light! He's seen us!

1148
01:42:18,212 --> 01:42:20,254
How long do you think he'll stay there?

1149
01:42:20,295 --> 01:42:23,389
Unless he's dumber than I think, he
won't wait until his lease is up.

1150
01:42:24,469 --> 01:42:26,522
Get my billfold out of the
drawer in the table there.

1151
01:42:26,562 --> 01:42:29,645
What do you need money for?
I'm gonna bail Lisa out of jail.

1152
01:42:29,695 --> 01:42:31,737
You could leave her there
till next Tuesday.

1153
01:42:31,777 --> 01:42:34,871
Then you could sneak
safely away as planned.

1154
01:42:34,911 --> 01:42:37,994
Yeach, let's see, $127.
How much do you need?

1155
01:42:39,086 --> 01:42:42,181
Well, this is first offence
burglary, that's about $250.

1156
01:42:43,260 --> 01:42:46,354
Lisa's handbag.
Yeach.

1157
01:42:46,393 --> 01:42:48,436
How much does she have?
Fifty cents.

1158
01:42:48,476 --> 01:42:51,570
Here, take this.
I got $20 or so in my purse.

1159
01:42:52,650 --> 01:42:53,651
What about the rest?

1160
01:42:53,691 --> 01:42:56,786
When those cops see Lisa,
they'll even contribute.

1161
01:43:02,042 --> 01:43:05,135
Just a minute. Hurry up!

1162
01:43:05,174 --> 01:43:08,269
Jefferies.
What is it now?

1163
01:43:08,308 --> 01:43:11,400
Doyle, I've got something
really big for you.

1164
01:43:11,441 --> 01:43:13,483
Why did I have to return your call?

1165
01:43:13,524 --> 01:43:16,617
Look! Don't louse up my night
with another mad killer -

1166
01:43:16,656 --> 01:43:19,750
Listen to me! Listen to me!
Lisa's in jail. She got arrested.

1167
01:43:20,832 --> 01:43:22,873
Your Lisa?
My Lisa.

1168
01:43:22,923 --> 01:43:26,007
Boy, you should have seen her.
She got into Thorwald's apartment,

1169
01:43:27,098 --> 01:43:29,139
But then he came back and the
only way I could get her out,

1170
01:43:29,180 --> 01:43:30,181
Was call the police.

1171
01:43:30,221 --> 01:43:31,222
I told you -
I know you told me.

1172
01:43:31,274 --> 01:43:34,356
She went in to get evidence, and
she came out with evidence.

1173
01:43:35,447 --> 01:43:38,530
Like what?
Like Mrs Thorwald's wedding ring.

1174
01:43:39,621 --> 01:43:42,705
If that woman was alive, she'd
be wearing that ring, right?

1175
01:43:43,796 --> 01:43:46,880
Hm. Lt's a possibility.
A possibility'? It's a fact.

1176
01:43:46,919 --> 01:43:48,971
He killed a dog last night

1177
01:43:49,011 --> 01:43:52,095
Because the dog was scratching
around in the garden. You know why?

1178
01:43:52,146 --> 01:43:55,229
Because he had something buried in
that garden that the dog scented.

1179
01:43:55,269 --> 01:43:56,280
Like an old ham bone?

1180
01:43:56,320 --> 01:43:59,403
I don't know what pet names
Thorwald had for his wife,

1181
01:43:59,443 --> 01:44:00,456
But I'll tell you this:

1182
01:44:00,494 --> 01:44:03,577
All those trips at night
with that metal suitcase,

1183
01:44:04,669 --> 01:44:05,670
He wasn't taking out his possessions,

1184
01:44:05,711 --> 01:44:08,803
Because his possessions are
still up in the apartment.

1185
01:44:08,843 --> 01:44:11,926
'Do you think perhaps it was old ham bone?'

1186
01:44:11,966 --> 01:44:15,061
And I'll tell you something else.

1187
01:44:15,100 --> 01:44:18,195
All the telephone calls he made
were long distance, alright?

1188
01:44:18,233 --> 01:44:21,327
Now, if he called his wife long
distance on the day she left,

1189
01:44:21,367 --> 01:44:23,409
After she arrived in Merritsville,

1190
01:44:23,450 --> 01:44:26,543
Why did she write a card to him
saying she arrived in Merritsville?

1191
01:44:27,623 --> 01:44:29,677
Why did she do that?

1192
01:44:29,716 --> 01:44:31,758
Where'd they take Lisa?
Precinct six.

1193
01:44:31,799 --> 01:44:33,850
I sent somebody over with the bail money.

1194
01:44:33,890 --> 01:44:35,933
Maybe you won't need it.
I'll run it down, Jeff.

1195
01:44:35,974 --> 01:44:39,066
Alright. Hurry up, will you?
This fellow knows he's being watched.

1196
01:44:40,148 --> 01:44:42,200
He's not gonna wait around forever.
Hurry up.

1197
01:44:42,240 --> 01:44:45,323
If that ring checks out, we'll
give him an escort. So long, Jeff.

1198
01:44:45,373 --> 01:44:48,457
So long.

1199
01:44:54,763 --> 01:44:55,764
Hello, Tom.

1200
01:44:55,805 --> 01:44:58,898
I think Thorwald's left. I don't see...

1201
01:45:01,020 --> 01:45:04,113
Hello?

1202
01:47:33,396 --> 01:47:36,490
What do you want from me?

1203
01:47:39,662 --> 01:47:42,757
Your friend, the girl, could have
turned me in. Why didn't she?

1204
01:47:44,878 --> 01:47:47,972
What is it you want, a lot of money?
I don't have any money.

1205
01:47:53,229 --> 01:47:56,321
Say something.

1206
01:47:56,360 --> 01:47:59,455
Say something! Tell me what you want!

1207
01:48:01,578 --> 01:48:04,671
Can you get me that ring back?

1208
01:48:05,752 --> 01:48:08,844
No.
Tell her to bring it back.

1209
01:48:08,885 --> 01:48:11,979
I can't. The police have it by now.

1210
01:48:47,497 --> 01:48:50,591
Lisa! Doyle!

1211
01:48:57,938 --> 01:49:01,031
What was that?

1212
01:49:06,288 --> 01:49:09,382
Look! Look over at that apartment!
They're fighting!

1213
01:49:16,729 --> 01:49:19,812
Look, he's throwing him out the window!

1214
01:49:27,161 --> 01:49:30,255
Doyle!

1215
01:49:32,375 --> 01:49:35,469
Creele, give me your .38!

1216
01:49:44,900 --> 01:49:46,950
I'm sorry, Jeff.
I got here as fast as I could.

1217
01:49:46,992 --> 01:49:50,075
Don't let anybody touch him.
Get me a medical bag from upstairs.

1218
01:49:50,125 --> 01:49:53,208
Lisa, sweetie, if anything
had happened to you -

1219
01:49:53,248 --> 01:49:56,342
I'm alright.
Gee, I'm proud of you.

1220
01:49:57,424 --> 01:49:59,476
You got enough for a search warrant now?

1221
01:49:59,515 --> 01:50:01,557
Oh, yeach, sure.

1222
01:50:01,598 --> 01:50:03,650
Lieutenant Doyle.
Yeach?

1223
01:50:03,690 --> 01:50:05,731
Is he OK?
He's alive.

1224
01:50:05,772 --> 01:50:08,867
Thorwald's ready to take us
on a tour of the East River.

1225
01:50:14,121 --> 01:50:16,174
Did he say what was
buried in the flower bed?

1226
01:50:16,213 --> 01:50:19,307
Yeach. He said the dog got too
inquisitive, so he dug it up.

1227
01:50:21,431 --> 01:50:24,522
It's in a hat box over in his apartment.

1228
01:50:24,562 --> 01:50:25,563
Want to look?
No, thanks.

1229
01:50:25,604 --> 01:50:28,696
I don't want any part of her.

1230
01:50:35,004 --> 01:50:37,046
I hope it's gonna be a hit.
This is the first release.

1231
01:50:37,086 --> 01:50:39,128
I'd love to hear it.

1232
01:50:39,179 --> 01:50:42,262
I can't tell you what this
music has meant to me.

1233
01:50:53,784 --> 01:50:56,878
Oh, sweet little puppy.

1234
01:50:56,918 --> 01:51:00,001
Don't jump. Let's try it again, puppy.

1235
01:51:00,053 --> 01:51:03,135
Stay still. Stay.

1236
01:51:10,482 --> 01:51:13,577
0h Stanley!
Hello, baby.

1237
01:51:14,658 --> 01:51:17,750
My, look what the army's done for you!

1238
01:51:19,874 --> 01:51:21,926
The army's made me hungry.

1239
01:51:21,965 --> 01:51:24,007
What have you got in the icebox to eat?

1240
01:51:24,048 --> 01:51:27,142
Boy, it's good to be home.

1241
01:51:30,314 --> 01:51:32,357
If you had told me you'd quit your job,

1242
01:51:32,396 --> 01:51:34,450
We wouldn't have gotten married.

1243
01:51:34,489 --> 01:51:37,582
Oh, honey. Come on.
