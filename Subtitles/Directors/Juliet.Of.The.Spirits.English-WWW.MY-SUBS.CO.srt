1
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:39,620
JULIET OF THE SPIRITS

2
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,380
Shall I light the candles, signora?

3
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,020
No, let her light them.

4
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,540
Yes, I want to light them.

5
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,940
You're putting on the red wig.
I like the blond one better.

6
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,220
Teresina, I'll decide
what wig I want to wear.

7
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,900
Pardon me, signora.
I just love blond hair.

8
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,060
But that one looks good too.

9
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,140
What shoes do you want
to wear?

10
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,580
I've already got them on,
Teresina.

11
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,100
I wanted to give you
a present.

12
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,740
It doesn't matter.
Some other time.

13
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,340
This one looks very nice.

14
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,340
No, it doesn't! I look terrible.
I won't wear any at all.

15
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:59,340
I never want to see
this dress again! Get rid of it!

16
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:02,060
And this too!
You can have it.

17
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:06,380
Has your husband said what he's giving
you for an anniversary present?

18
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:09,180
Your gift for him is beautiful.

19
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:16,300
Your husband's home.
Off the bed, you.

20
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:22,780
Hurry, he's already in the garden.
Let me try it on.

21
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,100
Quick, my dress!

22
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:31,420
I feel so excited.

23
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,140
How beautiful!

24
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,100
Is everything ready?

25
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,420
Light the candles.

26
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,660
His gift is under his napkin.

27
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,500
You've lost an earring!

28
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:48,500
I left it in the bathroom.
Go get it, please.

29
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,620
Turn off the lights.

30
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,380
What's the matter?
Is the power out?

31
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:21,140
Well, what's wrong?

32
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:27,140
You're right, I'm sorry.
What an idiot I am!

33
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:30,020
And I even wrote down
the date!

34
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:33,340
But I have a surprise
for you too.

35
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,340
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome!
It's our anniversary.

36
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,620
Look who's here.

37
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:44,500
Your anniversary?
Precious darling!

38
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:48,220
Look what I brought you
from Los Angeles.

39
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,260
It's a charm against spirits.

40
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,500
Hang it up!

41
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,580
It's been fifteen years, friends.

42
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:02,380
That dog has been so nervous
lately. Truk-Truk!

43
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:06,220
That's Genius, the greatest
clairvoyant on earth.

44
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,020
Dear lady, I know all about you.

45
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,700
Born under Aquarius, right?

46
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,980
Many great personalities
in this sign.

47
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,620
Always a pleasure to see you--

48
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,900
Madame Pompadour also.

49
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:22,180
Believe me, astrology's
a fascinating science.

50
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,180
Giulietta, can you give us
something to eat?

51
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,380
Anything--

52
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,900
They've made up.

53
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:32,620
I see red when this idiot
starts chattering.

54
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,380
I'll cook. I'll make my famous
Pilaf à la Dolores.

55
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:41,660
- Do you have paprika?
- Red pepper. I'll help you.

56
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,500
No!
Secret recipe.

57
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:47,500
To sculpt, cook, make love--
I live for these.

58
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:53,140
I'm Cesarino.
I've seen you at the Vigor Club.

59
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,940
Never been there.

60
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,100
I've done some weight lifting.

61
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,420
Lift me up!

62
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,980
What news does this handsome
gentleman have?

63
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,420
You already know everything.
You see it in your cards.

64
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,100
But you're so mysterious.
My cards can only go so far.

65
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,180
What'll we do?

66
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,740
Do we have to feed them all?

67
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,340
Of course, they're guests.

68
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,780
Where's signora Giulietta?

69
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,900
Now, don't be stupid
and start crying.

70
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:35,060
You're pretty as a doll.
I must speak to you.

71
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,820
Not now, excuse me...

72
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,380
Your sister's problems
are easily explained.

73
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:45,820
The ancient Hindus and Egyptians
knew all about these things.

74
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:49,100
Why don't you send your sister
to see me?

75
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,140
Behave. Behave.

76
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,900
Genius will try the pendulum.

77
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,740
Empty out your mind.

78
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,820
Things are looking very good.

79
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:09,060
You have a great magnetic charge.

80
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,380
This house is strange.
Who lived here?

81
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,060
A positive reaction, you see.

82
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:18,140
The pendulum moves
from left to right.

83
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,340
Not now.

84
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,220
What's going on?

85
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,540
Talking behind my back?

86
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,260
Are you angry?

87
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:31,900
I'm sorry, darling,
for not warning you.

88
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,420
They dropped by the office,
and there was nothing I could do.

89
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,660
You did well.
They're all so very nice.

90
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,220
Giorgio.

91
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,860
Do you love me?

92
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:08,620
Congratulations to you both!

93
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,940
Long live the happy couple!

94
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,340
Are you married?

95
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,820
Would I say congratulations?

96
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:26,260
It's much more heroic
to lie.

97
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,460
I'll see that you get
a gold medal.

98
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:31,180
Does your wife know
you're a hero?

99
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:36,820
Sit straight,
don't cross your legs.

100
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:40,100
I'll purify the air.

101
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:46,180
No cats!
They attract unquiet spirits.

102
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,340
You can shove your incense!

103
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,860
You can go to bed now.

104
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,660
She said she was through
with seances. I'm afraid.

105
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,180
Well, go on.

106
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,540
God, I sense so many spirits!

107
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,940
They're all around us.

108
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,140
Sorry, it's the incense.

109
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,660
Concentrate.
Empty your minds.

110
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:27,740
Yes, I feel a new presence.

111
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,820
One who's never come before.

112
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:33,300
Is the magnetism
strong enough, Maestro?

113
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,300
Tell your spirit to fill
the gin bottle.

114
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,540
O-o-o-ne.

115
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:46,940
Hold your breath...
two-o-o.

116
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,860
Take longer steps.
Ready, one.

117
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,380
There it is!

118
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,780
Question him, Maestro.

119
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,100
Spirit, can you tell us
your name?

120
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,780
It said, "l. "

121
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,380
"R. "

122
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,780
"H. "
Didn't it say "H"?

123
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,060
Shhh, it said "l".

124
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,220
"S. "
"Iris. "

125
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,100
It's a woman.

126
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,540
A lovely name.
I wonder who she was.

127
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:26,260
Who are you?

128
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,300
Very beautiful.

129
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,860
Right, Maestro?

130
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,060
That's what she said.

131
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:40,060
Do you have a message for us?

132
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,340
She said, "Love for everybody. "

133
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:49,220
That's a charming message.
Listen, Iris--

134
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:52,900
What was that?

135
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:56,460
Interference.
Is it still you, Iris?

136
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,260
It said no.
Let's find out.

137
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,340
What's your name?

138
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:06,980
"Olaf. "
He says "Olaf. "

139
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,340
Ah, you're Turkish.
Isn't that right?

140
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,460
He says he'll Turk you.

141
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,620
Tell each of us something nice...

142
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:21,220
that might make our lives
more bearable.

143
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,820
For example, what can you tell
our friend Dolly?

144
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,340
"Whore. "

145
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,980
No, dear, you don't understand.

146
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:34,340
He said, "Big old hag. "

147
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,660
That's not an insult.

148
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:45,260
Poor spirit.
Go in peace.

149
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,020
Professor, send him away.

150
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,340
Hello.

151
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,580
Who is it?

152
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,540
They hung up.

153
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,820
Giulietta, a message for you!

154
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,980
"Who do you think you are?

155
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:06,540
You're nothing to anybody.

156
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,700
Nobody needs you. "

157
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,860
Don't break the chain.
It's dangerous!

158
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,060
- What's going on?
- Is someone ill?

159
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:20,060
Turn on the lights!

160
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,900
She'll come to by herself.

161
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,580
She's receiving a message
from the other side.

162
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,180
Go away, Olaf.

163
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:32,140
Of course.
So long.

164
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,620
I'm here, you silly.

165
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,900
The maestro scares the ladies.

166
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:43,860
This little lady is very gifted...

167
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:47,220
very gifted indeed.

168
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,840
Has my husband gone?

169
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,200
Just now, signora.

170
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,680
He didn't want to wake you.

171
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,320
He said he won't be home
for dinner.

172
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,160
Your nieces are on the beach
with their nurse.

173
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,280
Good morning.

174
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,240
I have to clean the pool.
All this stuff clogs the drain.

175
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,840
Good idea, Gasperino.

176
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,560
Beautiful day, isn't it?

177
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,280
A fine thing.

178
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,000
He's from my town.

179
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,440
"For everybody. "

180
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,920
"Love for everybody. "

181
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,800
I'll bring breakfast right away.

182
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,800
Is that you, Iris?

183
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,840
Haven't you ever flown?
Or listened to shortwave?

184
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,480
The air is full of voices
giving orders.

185
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:42,480
Human voices with phlegm...
certainly not spirits.

186
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,440
Your naivete offends
scientific thought.

187
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,920
Certain electrical forces cause
bizarre reactions.

188
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:52,600
Couldn't we be getting messages
from other planets?

189
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,880
- But I saw in Readers' Digest--
- You shut up.

190
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,240
Forget these experiments.

191
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,680
As a child, I only had
to close my eyes.

192
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,320
Me too.
I'd close my eyes.

193
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,840
I'd see big, beautiful
colored balls.

194
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,040
I'd see castles, dark forests,
streets...

195
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,840
faces no bigger than that...

196
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,360
with little sparkling eyes.

197
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:20,200
They all scared me,
but it was wonderful.

198
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,600
This went on for years.

199
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,760
Then it stopped.

200
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,120
But I only had to close my eyes.

201
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,040
Possibly the result
of faulty digestion.

202
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,880
When we die, all that's left
is a pile of dust, maybe a bone...

203
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,600
in which case,
watch out for the cat!

204
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:52,560
You should take long swims,
buy a horse, go riding.

205
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,360
But, above all,
tell your husband...

206
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,280
to make love more often.

207
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:02,240
That's the best remedy
against spirits and toothaches.

208
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,480
I know, Doctor.

209
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,160
This really is an apparition.

210
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,320
Even I can believe in this one.

211
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,560
I'd welcome it day and night!

212
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,280
Our next-door neighbor.

213
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,800
We don't frequent her.

214
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:02,160
You may not frequent her,
but I'd love to.

215
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,440
Mademoiselle, get the children,
please.

216
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,040
I'm going swimming.

217
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:48,480
Our sweet Giulietta always
sees magic everywhere.

218
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,320
Help me, please.

219
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,480
I'm old.

220
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,680
Besides, this involves you.

221
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:17,960
Doctor.

222
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,400
Doctor, help me.

223
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,080
The lady over there sent us
this nice fruit.

224
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,840
Wasn't that nice?

225
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,680
No, I didn't say anything.

226
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,120
Don't run. Come here.

227
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,800
Mama, this morning on the beach
we saw a fish without its head.

228
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:10,040
Aunt Giulietta said it would grow back
if we threw it back in.

229
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,520
Did you go swimming?

230
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,960
Aunt Sylva! We saw a fish
without its head.

231
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,640
Don't touch.
Your hands are dirty.

232
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,800
I wish I could have a little
house at the seaside too.

233
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,640
You're pale!

234
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,320
The little one's
completely white.

235
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,280
Didn't you take her out
in the sun?

236
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,720
Don't you remember
what the doctor said?

237
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,680
At least two hours a day.

238
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,520
Sylva, what a nice surprise.

239
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,040
I came with Adele and Mama
for the children.

240
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,360
Mama.

241
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,200
You're running around
in this heat?

242
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,040
We're just going inside now.

243
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,440
You're perspiring.

244
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,640
Will you have lunch with me?

245
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,360
I can't. I have a TV rehearsal
at 3:00.

246
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:07,360
It's already 2:00.
When are we due at Luciana's?

247
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,040
At 4:00. Then we go
to the dressmaker's.

248
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,160
The children were fun.
They love it here with me.

249
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,160
You look wonderful.

250
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,720
I lost four pounds
for my director.

251
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,200
Do you go out at night?

252
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,680
Nothing much to do here.

253
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:27,160
Usually I'm tired
so we just stay home.

254
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,120
By the way, your husband
has some nerve.

255
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:34,360
He wanted me to go out with him
and some Venezuelan.

256
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,360
So I told him...

257
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,640
"Lovely, I'll bring
my boyfriend. "

258
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,800
And he says, "No, it doesn't matter,
some other time. "

259
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,080
What gives?

260
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,800
Isn't your husband ever home?

261
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,280
Every evening after work.

262
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,960
He works hard.
Isn't he exhausted?

263
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,600
We're thinking
of a long vacation.

264
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,400
Maybe we'll take a cruise,
just the two of us.

265
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,320
Maybe Spain or Greece.

266
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,160
I have all the pamphlets.

267
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,280
This time, we're really going.

268
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:30,440
Don't forget to watch TV
on Saturday.

269
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,800
Your little sister has
a perfectly marvelous part.

270
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,600
Till Sunday.

271
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:40,000
Bye, Mama.
What's the matter?

272
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,920
Nothing, just looking.

273
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,600
You should wear makeup.
At least some lipstick.

274
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,160
You're right, but...
we were at the beach.

275
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,120
Take better care of yourself.

276
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,880
"Move the eyes horizontally
for ten minutes. "

277
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,000
Look, signora.
Look how Elisabetta does it!

278
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,600
Not your head, just your eyes.
Wait.

279
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,840
Like this.

280
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,920
Getting faster and faster.

281
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,320
Fifteen days
of these eye exercises...

282
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,760
will restore your eyes
to the brilliance of two jewels.

283
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,040
Good evening.

284
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,040
Bring the tray in here.

285
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,960
No, dear, I'm not hungry.

286
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,320
What a day I had.
What's on TV?

287
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,800
Want some pie?

288
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,760
No, I had a snack at the office.

289
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,800
Sit down here.

290
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,720
Are you tired?

291
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,400
A little.

292
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,960
Try to pronounce
the following words.

293
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,680
Teresina, from now on
you have to speak like that.

294
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:16,000
Constantinople, consequential,
essential, success...

295
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,600
The constant repetition
of this exercise...

296
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,280
has brought success to some
of our most popular actresses.

297
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,840
You know, I was on the beach
today.

298
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,400
And?

299
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,640
Nothing. I told the doctor
about last night. He teased me.

300
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,440
Then at a certain point, l--

301
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,840
What?

302
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,800
Nothing.
It's not important.

303
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,240
Ladies and gentlemen,
good night.

304
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:51,160
Tomorrow I have
another hard day.

305
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,160
Call me at 7:00.
Have the car ready for 7:30.

306
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,160
Gabriella.

307
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,840
What did you say, dear?

308
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,040
Who is Gabriella?

309
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,080
Tell me, who is Gabriella?

310
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,800
Good morning, dear.
Did you sleep well?

311
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,840
Don't start smoking first thing.

312
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:14,520
Tonight I have those Brazilians.

313
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,480
They're important clients.
What are you doing?

314
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,440
You said to stop smoking.
I put the cigarette out.

315
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,480
You look marvelous.

316
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,040
My back, on the other hand,
is killing me.

317
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,920
Who is Gabriella?

318
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,800
I don't understand.
Who is Gabriella?

319
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:40,320
In your sleep you said
"Gabriella" twice.

320
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:48,480
Ah, there's my book.
I looked everywhere for it.

321
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,200
You must have been dreaming.

322
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,880
Who is she?
Do I happen to know her?

323
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,840
What are you talking about?
I don't know any Gabriella.

324
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,640
You must have misunderstood.

325
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,320
I'll try not to be late.
Anyway, I'll call you.

326
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,760
Going swimming?

327
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,880
Hello. Hello!

328
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,080
Oh, go to hell!

329
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,760
I'm sorry, but it happens
three or four times a day.

330
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,000
I answer, they hang up.

331
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,560
Nothing.

332
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:53,720
So when he comes back
from Venezuela, repentant...

333
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,280
she says, "Some nerve you've got. "

334
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,960
Gabriella.

335
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,560
I heard it right.
He said "Gabriella. "

336
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,800
But he seemed so sincere
when he denied it.

337
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,120
He likes the ladies, it's true.

338
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,000
Am I right, signora?

339
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,440
You have to be understanding.

340
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,080
You can't force others
to do what you want.

341
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:17,000
Not me!
I believe what they tell me.

342
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:21,600
If they say yes,
it's yes, not "no" or "but. "

343
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,200
Isn't that right, signora?

344
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,960
You can't be domineering.

345
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,440
But he said to me once...

346
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,640
"I'll never lie to you. "

347
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:32,960
"Never. "

348
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:40,640
By daylight
your house is a dream.

349
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:44,040
Ciao, Val! Watch the dog.
We're full of cats here.

350
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,400
Enchanting!

351
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:51,560
This perfume makes me drunk.

352
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:56,160
Look at the dew!
That is dew, isn't it?

353
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,520
How divinely pure!

354
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,760
It pains the heart,
it's so beautiful.

355
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,120
I'd like to roll naked in it.

356
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,080
Why don't you?

357
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:10,520
We've all become
too complicated, uncivilized.

358
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,480
What are you doing?
It's sopping wet here.

359
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,400
Aren't you afraid
of rheumatism?

360
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,120
Sit here, Valentina.

361
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,000
Teresina, move the peppers.

362
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,760
What are you doing?

363
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,880
We're stringing peppers
for the winter.

364
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,760
In garlands?

365
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,080
A wreath of peppers!

366
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,520
What a wonderful housewife
you are!

367
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:44,400
I'm the opposite, on the other hand.
It's shameful.

368
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,880
Why am I like that?

369
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,880
I feel uprooted and adrift.

370
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,000
Peppers, they're really nothing...

371
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:55,000
but if I could string them,
perhaps I'd be saved.

372
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,280
Come, Teresina.

373
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,480
Nobody's thought about lunch.

374
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,000
Can you stay?

375
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,920
Wake up, Teresina.
It's almost noon.

376
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,800
What?

377
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:11,080
I was supposed to meet
Raniero at 11:00!

378
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:15,840
We have such fights if I'm late.

379
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,120
Bye, precious!

380
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,960
I'll see you at 5:00.

381
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,520
Where will you see me
at 5:00?

382
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,160
Didn't I tell you?
That's why I came.

383
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,240
You've got to come with us
this afternoon.

384
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,040
Don't say no.
You can't miss it.

385
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,080
But where?

386
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:33,840
Bishma!
At 5:00 at the Plaza.

387
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,680
For only two days. He comes
to Europe once every seven years.

388
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:41,400
He's hugely popular in America
in clubs, schools.

389
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,920
It's the chance of a lifetime.

390
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,200
Hold still.

391
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,800
The chance of a lifetime.
Do you know his experiments?

392
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,160
I've never heard of them.

393
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:51,320
Giulietta, what world
are you living in?

394
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,760
He's a fabulous clairvoyant.

395
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,600
A man-woman who holds
the secret of both sexes.

396
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,400
He's an oracle.
He'll enlighten you.

397
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,600
He could change your life.

398
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,520
- Is he a Hindu?
- Hindu, Chinese, what does it matter?

399
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,360
Bishma belongs to the world.

400
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:13,320
Some meetings are predestined.

401
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,240
Maybe he's here for you.

402
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,920
I can't go. Suppose Giorgio phones
and I'm out?

403
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:22,360
- You'll be sorry.
- Don't expect me.

404
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,880
There's a power outage.

405
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,320
- Where is Bishma's apartment?
- The meeting is on the terrace.

406
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,320
Show these ladies upstairs.

407
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,280
We have to take the stairs.
The elevator is stuck.

408
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,880
- Let's go back, Valentina.
- Has he already started?

409
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,920
I don't know, signora.

410
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,200
Come on. Did you prepare
your questions?

411
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,880
What questions?
I've nothing to ask.

412
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,160
When I was a girl,
Papa used to tell me...

413
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,040
this hotel was for--

414
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,160
At last! Did you get lost
in the dark?

415
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,200
He foretold everything.

416
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:15,520
That night I dreamed of His Excellency,
but without his uniform.

417
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,160
What could it mean?

418
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:30,080
Cherish your wife
as part of yourself.

419
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:33,280
He who loves his wife
loves himself.

420
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,040
Love one another...

421
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,960
for better, for worse...

422
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,360
for richer, for poorer...

423
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,320
in sickness and in health.

424
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,960
What are you looking at?

425
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,080
There's a wedding party.

426
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,800
How delightful.

427
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,560
That's the second step...

428
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:58,120
but it's still not true illumination.

429
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,120
So, what is this?

430
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:04,000
The Single Spirit.
That fruit is only appearance.

431
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:07,640
But the real Buddha
is beyond such differences.

432
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,640
Right?

433
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,640
That's the third step.

434
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,480
At this point the truth
is both far and near.

435
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,840
So, then, what is this?

436
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,480
Isn't it an apple?

437
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,680
No, dear, you don't understand.

438
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,640
You have to see
beyond material form.

439
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,400
The Master himself will tell you.

440
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,240
It's an apple...

441
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,040
just a humble little apple...

442
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,040
small and red...

443
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,720
and bruised on one side...

444
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,400
but at the same time
it's the Buddha...

445
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,200
and the Single Spirit.

446
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:52,360
Things return to being things...

447
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,720
but the Enlightened
sees at the same time...

448
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,880
Oneness and Manyness...

449
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,800
appearance as well as substance.

450
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,400
- Do heaven and hell exist?
- Who are you?

451
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,440
A painter.
An American painter.

452
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,120
Let me see.

453
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,200
Cut off my head!

454
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,280
Come on,
cut her head off!

455
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,840
It's one of Lao-Tse's fables.

456
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,720
Go on!

457
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,640
Behold, the gates of hell
are opening.

458
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,960
And now, the gates of paradise.

459
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,320
What's the matter?

460
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,520
Don't disturb him.

461
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,480
He's in communication
with his god.

462
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:27,920
The lady called Giulietta
may enter now...

463
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,600
but only she.

464
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,080
Please.

465
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,120
How is he?

466
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,280
He wants to see me alone.
Go away!

467
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:51,080
- But I brought you!
- Fine, but he wants to talk to me!

468
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,400
Where is he?

469
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:56,000
I don't know. In the bathroom,
maybe. Wait outside.

470
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,240
We have an appointment--

471
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,280
Giulietta, do you know
the Kama Sutra?

472
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,920
The sexual act is a conflict.

473
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:26,240
To be happy you must behave
as if in battle.

474
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:30,440
The battleground of passion
is your body...

475
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:35,080
and of the body, the shoulders...

476
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,280
and the place between the breasts.

477
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:44,240
The sounds to emit in love...

478
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:47,320
that procure pleasure:
the sound hin.

479
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,440
The great sigh.

480
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,160
The sound put.

481
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,960
The sound fut.

482
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,440
The sound plat.

483
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,200
We can add sounds...

484
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:06,160
Like those made by pigeons...

485
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,600
and green sparrows...

486
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,920
and flamingoes...

487
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,440
and quails...

488
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,280
and storks.

489
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:29,520
Sounds that can be employed...

490
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,560
according to the occasion.

491
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:35,960
Different kinds of bites are...

492
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,720
the dark bite...

493
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,280
the swollen bite...

494
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,880
the point...

495
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,440
the line of the point...

496
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,120
coral and jewel...

497
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,400
the torn cloud...

498
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,600
the wolf bite.

499
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:59,800
Love is a religion, Giulietta.

500
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,000
Your husband is your god...

501
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:07,040
and you are priestess
of his cult.

502
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,120
Your spirit, like this incense...

503
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,720
must glow and smoke...

504
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:17,960
on the altar of your body in love.

505
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,320
If you have any questions...

506
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,520
the master will answer.

507
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,320
No, nothing really...

508
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,840
only--

509
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:43,880
Since last night,
I feel I've lost everything.

510
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:48,960
I'm afraid my husband has
another woman.

511
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:56,320
Why don't you learn to please
your husband more, Giulietta?

512
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,400
I do please him.

513
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,240
Remember me?

514
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:06,200
I was born like this,
a woman of passion.

515
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,600
Am I beautiful?

516
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:12,520
Speak frankly.
Am I beautiful?

517
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,880
Very.

518
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
I think so too.
You've seen my hair?

519
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:24,120
I never comb it.
I caress it.

520
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,680
I love to caress myself.

521
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,640
I have the whitest skin.

522
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,240
If I'm in a bad mood...

523
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,320
I go to the mirror.

524
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:39,640
I turn around, I study my back,
and I'm happy again.

525
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:42,120
Did you buy those stockings?

526
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,640
No, what stockings?

527
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,520
The black net stockings.

528
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,200
Woman all want to be sirens...

529
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,960
but don't know their trade.

530
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:57,720
- Love is a trade?
- I didn't say trade. I said art.

531
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,200
I heard you very well.
You said trade.

532
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:03,080
That of a prostitute?
Good advice!

533
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:15,960
Who is it?

534
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:19,160
Olaf, go away!
Iris! Nabur!

535
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,160
Grow beautiful like me!
Like me!

536
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,600
Refined femininity.

537
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,560
You're beautiful, Giulietta.
I want to kiss you.

538
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,160
Enough!

539
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,880
I want to go.
Help me.

540
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,280
- Calm down.
- I want to go.

541
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:03,360
It's not advisable to invoke
our mysterious inner forces...

542
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,680
without proper preparation.

543
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,960
It can be very dangerous.

544
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:11,520
But these spirits are generous
and kind...

545
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:15,560
even if they sometimes
play tricks.

546
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:27,320
Good-bye, signora.
Did you receive good advice?

547
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,440
- Yes, thank you.
- You're pleased?

548
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:32,280
Good-bye.

549
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,720
Good luck!

550
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,760
What did he say? What did you see?
Out here we heard--

551
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,280
There's another message.

552
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:48,320
Something new will happen
this evening.

553
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,200
Something new and beautiful.

554
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,320
Sangría.

555
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:57,280
It quenches every thirst
in those who drink it...

556
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:02,160
even that thirst
which is never confessed.

557
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:06,040
They call it
the drink of oblivion.

558
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,880
Strange.

559
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,080
That's not his voice.

560
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,520
It's a spirit speaking.

561
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:17,440
Did you hear?
Something extraordinary.

562
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:20,280
He said she'll have an extraordinary
encounter this evening.

563
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,800
Aren't you pleased?

564
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,760
- Did you see her yourself?
- I thought so.

565
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:32,200
- Did she say, "l am Iris?"
- No, but I felt it was her.

566
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:35,040
I felt the same sensation
as the other night.

567
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,480
That's strange.

568
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,520
Who could she be?

569
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:43,920
Perhaps Grandpa's
bareback rider.

570
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,240
My grandfather was a professor, and
he fell in love with a beautiful dancer.

571
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:11,520
What a pretty little girl!
What's your name?

572
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:14,680
Tell her your name.

573
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:18,200
Did you see how brave
this young lady is?

574
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:22,400
Your number was wonderful.
My most heartfelt compliments.

575
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,720
A beautiful woman makes me feel
more religious.

576
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,080
Who knows why?
I always imagined...

577
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:12,960
they ran off
in that funny circus plane.

578
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,760
Professor De Filippis,
in God's name!

579
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:32,160
I order you to come down
immediately.

580
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,200
I'm your principal.

581
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:35,800
You'll answer to me...

582
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,280
for your unpardonable conduct!

583
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:46,400
The principal had him kicked out
of every school in the kingdom.

584
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,200
He vanished.

585
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:51,000
After two years, he came back,
cheerful as ever.

586
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:53,280
Mama didn't want him
in the house.

587
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:56,520
I saw him secretly at Christmas.

588
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:00,120
Such stories he told!
He frightened me a little.

589
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,880
The bishop said he was in league
with Satan.

590
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:06,720
I was still little
when they took me to his funeral.

591
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,320
Mama didn't cry.

592
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:11,040
She wore a beautiful black dress.

593
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:12,920
What a stupendous woman
your mother is!

594
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,560
Yes, my mother's very beautiful.

595
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:18,800
One night I got out of bed and saw her.
She was like a queen.

596
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,640
Perhaps she was going to a ball
with Papa.

597
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,840
Rosa aurata.

598
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,040
A name like a line of poetry.

599
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:01,960
I grew it once.

600
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,120
My garden in Cordova
was famous.

601
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,800
You're very fortunate.

602
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:10,720
Flowers thank those
who care for them.

603
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:22,480
One can see these plants
are showered with love.

604
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:25,760
To give so much every day...

605
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:27,800
you must be full of love.

606
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:31,960
Is this all right, signore?

607
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:35,160
Is this what you wanted?

608
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:36,840
Yes, thank you.

609
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,200
Three slices of lemon...

610
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,040
three of orange...

611
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,920
sparkling water.

612
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,760
Now, a glass.

613
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:51,360
Here, signore.

614
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:54,880
Not a champagne glass.
An ordinary one.

615
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,320
Teresina, get a big glass.

616
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:04,360
Three spoonfuls of sugar.

617
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,440
Shall I give him this one,
signora?

618
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:15,720
- Will this do?
- Thank you.

619
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,320
In Valencia, they add cloves...

620
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,840
but in Cordova, we prefer
a more delicate flavor.

621
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:33,880
Please, try it and tell me
how you like it.

622
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:40,560
Lovely.
What's it called?

623
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:42,080
Sangría.

624
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,640
They say it quenches every thirst
in those who drink it...

625
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,640
even that thirst
which is never confessed.

626
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,600
In fact, they call it
the drink of oblivion.

627
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:53,720
You'll have to stay with us
at least a week.

628
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:55,720
You've introduced yourselves?

629
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:59,680
I've often spoken of José. Do you
remember? I was his guest in Spain.

630
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:02,840
- When?
- Last year, in Castile.

631
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,360
A wonderful palace.
What paintings!

632
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,080
He has two Goyas...
or were they Velasquez?

633
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,760
Neither. Riveras.

634
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:12,880
Marvelous!

635
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,480
Imagine, he wanted
to go to a hotel.

636
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:18,640
Where could you find such peace
and quiet as we have here?

637
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:36,960
What counts are
smooth movements.

638
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:39,560
Balance.

639
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:43,280
A good bullfighter must have
a pure heart...

640
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:46,600
and clear thoughts,
like monks or dancers.

641
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,520
He raises some of the best bulls
in Spain...

642
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,760
and at night, this fool
lights up his garden...

643
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:53,800
for solo bullfights!

644
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:57,560
What courage!
But isn't it dangerous?

645
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:00,280
No, signora. It's all a question
of style and poetry...

646
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:02,320
and poetry is never dangerous.

647
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:05,120
My best friends are bullfighters.

648
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,760
They compose music
and write poetry.

649
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,760
They hate to see blood.

650
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,640
The style of bullfighting in Cordova
has an unimaginable harmony.

651
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:19,360
- May l?
- Please.

652
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,880
Wait a moment.

653
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:26,000
I might have something better.

654
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,200
Will this do for a cape?

655
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,920
There's the bull...

656
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,760
dying in his own illusion.

657
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:46,120
It's not the sword
that kills him...

658
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:49,240
but our magic in evading him.

659
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:54,720
I send him to the void
with illusionary blows.

660
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:07,840
One false step,
like a bad rhyme in poetry...

661
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:10,280
and then there is
mortal danger.

662
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:11,960
Please, signora.

663
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:16,640
A spontaneity
born of calculation.

664
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:21,160
A pure heart, clear thoughts...

665
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:24,040
movements exact to the inch.

666
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,920
Thus the monster is defeated.

667
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:38,040
You didn't see what José
brought me from Spain.

668
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:40,600
I'll get it. It's magnificent.

669
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:56,320
Surely you admire
García Lorca?

670
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:00,800
Destiny plays odd tricks.

671
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:04,360
I was in Madrid,
hesitant to leave.

672
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:08,440
I had a foreboding.

673
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:12,000
Now that I'm here, I'm happy.

674
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:16,320
What's left in life, if you take away
the harmony of such an evening?

675
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:20,360
I'm indebted to you for such happiness.
I hope it continues.

676
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,440
For so little?

677
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:24,440
It can be everything.

678
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:28,000
Yes, a sudden decision...

679
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:30,880
meeting an old friend
who lives by the sea...

680
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:33,440
a lost calm found again.

681
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:37,880
Everything becomes clear
and plausible.

682
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,440
Giulietta, what is it?
Come here.

683
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:53,640
Isn't it a wonderful gift?

684
00:54:57,960 --> 00:54:59,480
A magic telescope.

685
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:03,920
Last year there was
a terrible mess at their villa.

686
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:07,160
They give parties,
which she organizes.

687
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:09,840
The police became involved,
and they wanted to deport her.

688
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:14,520
- I've heard fascinating stories.
- It's true, she's a beautiful woman.

689
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:37,280
You're going to go to sleep already?
I wanted to talk to you.

690
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:39,200
Did you say something?

691
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,440
It doesn't matter.

692
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:59,640
- Good night, dear.
- Good night. I'm going to read a while.

693
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:54,360
I had them change the color
of the seats.

694
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:56,840
That red color reminded me
of a cardinal.

695
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:00,080
So now it's black,
with tobacco-colored seats.

696
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:01,640
Do you like that?

697
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:05,560
I told the guys, "It's for the most
beautiful woman in the world. "

698
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:10,640
I really didn't wake you?

699
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:12,800
What were you doing?

700
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:16,640
Of me?
What were you thinking?

701
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:22,440
Good night, you little monster.
Till tomorrow.

702
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:25,000
I'll wake you up. Bye.

703
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:31,760
I forgot to ring
the wake-up service.

704
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:34,400
It's a good thing
I remembered in time.

705
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:36,760
Who did you call?

706
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:40,160
I told you, I requested
a wake-up call.

707
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:45,480
You want some? Come on.
Let's go to bed.

708
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:47,760
Who were you calling?

709
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:50,680
What's wrong with you?
Come on.

710
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:24,820
What is it?

711
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:27,020
Let's come back some other time...

712
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:28,860
or you go alone.

713
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:32,140
I don't behave that way.
We have an appointment.

714
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:36,700
- But treating him like a thief--
- But he is a thief.

715
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:39,460
Hasn't he stolen your youth,
your peace of mind, your trust?

716
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:40,980
He's the worst of thieves!

717
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:43,540
But setting a spy on him...

718
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:45,500
who listens to everything,
sees everything.

719
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:47,340
It would be like
living with a third person.

720
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:51,020
Isn't there a third person
already?

721
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:54,380
Trust them.

722
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:57,780
Put yourself in their hands,
like going to confession.

723
00:58:57,860 --> 00:59:00,860
They'll see to everything.

724
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:19,380
Hello. Follow me.

725
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:22,740
Excuse my unexpected attire.

726
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:27,380
Professional demands require
certain transformations.

727
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:31,700
We serve anybody
who needs to know, to find out.

728
00:59:31,820 --> 00:59:33,460
But I ask you...

729
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:36,100
are you sure
you won't be sorry later?

730
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:39,100
Think, before it's too late.

731
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:44,140
In these cases,
I recommend a little trip...

732
00:59:44,260 --> 00:59:46,100
a second honeymoon.

733
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:50,300
Think ahead to the joy of a marriage
still alive in your old age...

734
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:54,900
of the sweetness of two white heads
on the same pillow.

735
00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:56,780
In time, suspicions melt away.

736
00:59:57,100 --> 01:00:01,340
Tomorrow you'll laugh
at what upsets you now.

737
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:04,220
I don't think one can laugh
at one's own suffering.

738
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:07,380
Anyway, my sister must know
the truth.

739
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:11,020
So right.
I'm at your disposal.

740
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:13,540
What does this gentleman do?

741
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:16,900
He organizes parties, rallies--

742
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:18,900
What does he do?
I've never really figured it out.

743
01:00:19,020 --> 01:00:21,580
- Perhaps public relations?
- Exactly.

744
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:23,580
He arranges receptions...

745
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:26,300
premieres, fashion show openings.

746
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:30,740
Do you have a picture of him?
I'll show it to our psychologist.

747
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:36,820
Now I have
a very delicate question.

748
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:42,220
Rest assured, nothing said here
will go beyond this office.

749
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:44,980
For example, when he looks at you--
Excuse me.

750
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:47,220
Would you please take off
your glasses?

751
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:48,820
- My glasses?
- Yes.

752
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:55,100
Thank you. Does he blush
when you look straight in his eyes?

753
01:00:55,220 --> 01:00:57,940
Does he always have
an alibi ready?

754
01:00:58,100 --> 01:01:00,540
No, I don't think so.

755
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:04,060
Have you ever caught him speaking
a foreign language on the phone?

756
01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:07,020
Caught him? He speaks
foreign languages with certain clients.

757
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:08,700
Do you have nicknames
for each other?

758
01:01:08,820 --> 01:01:10,700
What does he call you
in intimate moments?

759
01:01:10,820 --> 01:01:12,220
Excuse me, I don't see--

760
01:01:12,340 --> 01:01:15,060
Come in, Valli.
I need to see you.

761
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:17,420
I don't see what relevance
this might have--

762
01:01:17,780 --> 01:01:20,620
Every detail is important,
my dear lady.

763
01:01:20,740 --> 01:01:24,580
We mustn't neglect
even the smallest detail.

764
01:01:25,540 --> 01:01:26,460
Hello.

765
01:01:26,580 --> 01:01:29,580
Dr. Valli, our esteemed colleague.

766
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:32,580
Would you show him
the picture of the subject?

767
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:35,700
Is it really necessary
to leave them here?

768
01:01:35,780 --> 01:01:37,500
Indispensable.

769
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:48,820
Forgive me
this most deplorable indiscretion.

770
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:51,380
My questions are
not yet finished.

771
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:54,580
Have you found lipstick
on his handkerchiefs?

772
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:57,500
A woman's perfume,
not your own?

773
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:01,620
A whiff of beauty cream?

774
01:02:01,740 --> 01:02:03,460
Hairs on his coat?

775
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:07,180
And-- forgive me--
scratches on his body?

776
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:08,780
No, never.

777
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:11,380
Let's hear what
our psychologist has to say.

778
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:16,340
From the photo, I'd say we're dealing
with a man between 38 and 45...

779
01:02:16,460 --> 01:02:19,780
not easy-going,
though apparently docile.

780
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:22,060
Cold rages.
Success with the ladies.

781
01:02:22,180 --> 01:02:25,300
One must be careful,
for he could lose his head, yes.

782
01:02:25,420 --> 01:02:28,540
Suppressed fears.
Great need of his mother.

783
01:02:29,260 --> 01:02:31,700
Who doesn't need his mother?

784
01:02:32,020 --> 01:02:34,620
Dearest lady,
from this moment on...

785
01:02:34,740 --> 01:02:38,660
every minute of our days and nights
will be dedicated to you.

786
01:02:38,740 --> 01:02:40,300
Right, Valli?

787
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:44,260
In one week you'll know everything
your husband does in a day.

788
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:49,420
Our zoom cameras make secrecy
an outdated concept.

789
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:52,540
Doors and walls
mean nothing to us.

790
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:56,820
We'll show you your husband
as you've never known him.

791
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:58,780
You'll penetrate
that shadowy zone...

792
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:01,180
where you've never been able
to enter before.

793
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:07,560
Are you certain
you want to know?

794
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:17,480
Woe be unto him
who tolerates a sinner...

795
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:20,120
for he becomes an accomplice
in his sin...

796
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:22,800
and will burn with him
in eternal flames.

797
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:26,080
Take vengeance.

798
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:28,920
I am the Lord of justice.

799
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:33,600
Yes, I want to know.

800
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:36,720
It's my right.

801
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:39,520
I no longer know who he is,
what belongs to me...

802
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:41,360
or what I mean to him.

803
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:43,920
I must know what he thinks,
what he does.

804
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,200
I want to know everything,
everything about him.

805
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:36,280
But I haven't gained weight,
signora.

806
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:38,920
Haven't you? Any more
and you'll break the platform.

807
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:40,920
Giulietta, do you like Nadir?

808
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,040
What lengths I went to
to find an archangel...

809
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:44,720
and he was right here all along.

810
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:46,480
He's the doorman's son.

811
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:50,280
Oh, there's chocolate
in the refrigerator. Have some.

812
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:52,440
You haven't seen these new works,
have you?

813
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:54,440
Seeing them is not enough.

814
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:57,560
You have to touch them.
Go ahead.

815
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:01,000
I get a shock when I touch them,
as if they were alive.

816
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:04,240
Michelangelo told his Moses,
"Why don't you speak?"

817
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:07,120
I want to tell
these powerful figures...

818
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:08,640
"Make love to me!"

819
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:10,320
I mean it!

820
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:15,080
My art is deeply spiritual.
You don't think so, do you?

821
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:18,160
I want to restore
God's physicality.

822
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:20,480
I used to fear God.

823
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:22,520
He crushed me,
he terrified me.

824
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:26,640
Why? Because I imagined Him
theoretically, abstractly.

825
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:30,200
But He's really the most beautiful
body that ever was...

826
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:32,000
so that's how I try to portray Him.

827
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:33,440
A physical God, made of flesh...

828
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:35,600
a perfectly-formed hero...

829
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:39,640
whom I can desire
and even take as a lover.

830
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:51,120
I, on the other hand,
when I was little...

831
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:54,480
thought God hid
behind a big door...

832
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:56,880
that was always closed...

833
01:05:57,720 --> 01:05:59,880
covered with dust...

834
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:03,440
in the little theater
in the convent.

835
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:12,160
The play that year
was about a martyred saint.

836
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:15,000
I was chosen for the part.

837
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:42,000
What innocent eyes you have,
Giulietta.

838
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:44,960
You look like
the saint herself.

839
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:47,160
Did she see God?

840
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:51,920
Yes, when she flew to heaven
in the flames of martyrdom.

841
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:55,920
Promise you'll tell me everything.

842
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:57,560
Ask Him if He loves me.

843
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:01,360
- For sure?
- Yes, Laura, I'll ask Him.

844
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:06,480
Come on, Giulietta,
it's your cue.

845
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,640
Arrest her!

846
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:15,680
Bring her before me!

847
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:20,280
Your religion is against
the laws of the empire!

848
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:24,480
But we are merciful
and inclined to pardon.

849
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:27,080
Do you renounce your faith...

850
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:29,720
and bow to the emperor?

851
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:31,720
No, never!

852
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:34,680
You prefer a martyr's death?
You accept martyrdom?

853
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,440
Yes, I accept it.

854
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:39,720
There is still time,
if you wish to save yourself.

855
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:43,200
Not the salvation
which you intend.

856
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:46,560
I wish only to save my soul.

857
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:49,880
The emperor's orders.

858
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:51,920
Burn the Christian!

859
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:25,500
That's enough!

860
01:08:25,620 --> 01:08:27,420
Shameful! Indecent!

861
01:08:27,580 --> 01:08:29,660
Give me back my granddaughter!
Giulietta, come down from there!

862
01:08:29,780 --> 01:08:31,740
Obey your grandfather.
Come down from there!

863
01:08:31,860 --> 01:08:34,780
Professor, in the name of God!

864
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:37,580
Come to your senses!
Stop this shameful behavior!

865
01:08:37,660 --> 01:08:39,940
You're the ones who must stop.

866
01:08:40,060 --> 01:08:41,620
I am perfectly in my senses.

867
01:08:41,820 --> 01:08:45,500
Burning this child!
Are we among cannibals?

868
01:08:45,820 --> 01:08:47,260
Bring down that contraption.

869
01:08:47,740 --> 01:08:50,500
Bring it down!
You beasts!

870
01:08:51,340 --> 01:08:54,780
Go home, children.
Get away from there! Scat!

871
01:08:58,380 --> 01:09:02,300
You nuns should fry on the grill,
but you're afraid to show your legs.

872
01:09:02,740 --> 01:09:04,980
What are you teaching
these children?

873
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:07,980
Are you trying to drive
these poor innocents to insanity?

874
01:09:08,860 --> 01:09:10,940
Roast each other
on your old grill!

875
01:09:11,060 --> 01:09:15,060
I order you to desist!
Come down!

876
01:09:15,140 --> 01:09:17,100
Remember, I'm your principal.

877
01:09:17,180 --> 01:09:18,940
You must obey me!

878
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:21,420
Your conduct is abominable!

879
01:09:21,580 --> 01:09:24,780
Oh, shut up, Abominable.

880
01:09:24,900 --> 01:09:27,820
And what about you!
Have you nothing to say?

881
01:09:28,180 --> 01:09:31,660
You let them do anything?
You like being roasted?

882
01:09:31,740 --> 01:09:33,180
Stupid girl!

883
01:09:33,260 --> 01:09:35,180
Giulietta, did you see God?
Answer me.

884
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:37,180
Did you? Answer me!

885
01:09:37,300 --> 01:09:40,580
Signora, I implore you,
pardon this outrageous incident...

886
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:42,740
which dishonors our school.

887
01:09:42,940 --> 01:09:46,180
Please accept
my most abject apologies.

888
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:20,380
Where did that cat
come from?

889
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:22,100
It's not one of ours.
I don't know.

890
01:10:22,180 --> 01:10:24,020
But did you see what
big, bad yellow eyes it has?

891
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:26,020
- He's from the villa next door.
- He's gorgeous.

892
01:10:29,900 --> 01:10:31,380
Stop. I want to catch him.

893
01:10:31,980 --> 01:10:34,180
He went inside.

894
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:37,020
Gasperino, help us catch him.

895
01:10:37,220 --> 01:10:39,380
Signora, I don't get along
with cats.

896
01:10:39,780 --> 01:10:41,980
Careful, signora.
He might scratch.

897
01:10:42,140 --> 01:10:43,540
Can we keep him?

898
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:48,700
They're terrible critters.
They bite and scratch.

899
01:10:48,980 --> 01:10:50,580
They're not dangerous.

900
01:10:54,540 --> 01:10:56,980
What a big fat kitty you are!

901
01:10:58,100 --> 01:10:59,620
Gorgeous!

902
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:03,340
"Suzy. " Your name is Suzy.

903
01:11:24,820 --> 01:11:26,900
The gate is open.

904
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:52,700
What a pretty house you have!

905
01:12:20,740 --> 01:12:23,220
Hello.
Excuse me, signora.

906
01:12:34,980 --> 01:12:36,860
Health and wealth to you all!

907
01:12:36,940 --> 01:12:40,580
May God make you
ever more beautiful for His glory!

908
01:12:40,820 --> 01:12:43,700
Signora, have him tell you
the story about the Barletta convent.

909
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:45,620
Come here.

910
01:12:47,380 --> 01:12:48,340
Am I good?

911
01:12:48,420 --> 01:12:51,660
You're an angel!
Till tomorrow.

912
01:12:52,620 --> 01:12:56,020
Mama, take Alyosha away.
I need to talk on the phone.

913
01:12:57,820 --> 01:12:59,020
Hello?

914
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:06,740
You see, signora?
He goes on like this all day.

915
01:13:06,820 --> 01:13:08,500
He's a good boy...

916
01:13:08,580 --> 01:13:11,860
but he's committed the folly
of falling in love with my daughter.

917
01:13:18,620 --> 01:13:22,420
His powers of seduction
are all on the inside.

918
01:13:22,620 --> 01:13:24,100
One can't see them
on the outside.

919
01:13:24,220 --> 01:13:28,500
Woman are seduced
by beautiful appearances, Alyosha...

920
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:32,740
and you have none at all,
not even a little!

921
01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:34,460
Pretty kitty!

922
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:40,760
- There's my vagabond!
- I found him in my garden...

923
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:42,600
and thought I'd bring him back.

924
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:44,080
You're so kind.

925
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:46,440
He's so pretty, someone might
steal him if you don't watch out.

926
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:48,240
Did you hear that?
They'll steal you!

927
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:51,120
Shut up!
Take him away!

928
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:53,800
Where were you?

929
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:59,400
- Did you thank signora...
- Giulietta.

930
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:02,600
What a pretty name! I'm Suzy.
Did he give you any trouble?

931
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:04,120
No, he's very good.

932
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:09,120
But he's a big drunk.
He likes champagne.

933
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:11,280
Oh, the phone!

934
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:19,840
A lady from next door
brought the cat back.

935
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:25,120
Of course, all my friends
are pretty.

936
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:27,280
Perhaps.

937
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:36,960
What a bully
Please, excuse me.

938
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:39,520
It's really time
we were acquainted.

939
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:41,880
I don't want to disturb you.

940
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,360
- Have a drink. A little champagne?
- Thank you.

941
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:45,720
None for you!

942
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:50,160
- Can you stay for lunch?
- Thanks, but I really can't.

943
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:53,400
We'll send them all away
and I'll cook. What do you like?

944
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:56,360
I can't open it. Alberto!

945
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:59,560
You're gorgeous,
all sweaty like that.

946
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:02,640
Don't worry,
I'm not after anything.

947
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:09,320
I'll tell Suzy what you did.

948
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:15,240
Some lovely champagne
for signora Giulietta.

949
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:17,800
Paolo, come here!

950
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:19,560
Just a little for you, eh?

951
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:22,600
You know what happens
when you drink. You go mad.

952
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:30,280
Please forgive the mess.

953
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:32,760
I'm remodeling the house.

954
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:35,800
I want brighter colors.
Would you like a tour?

955
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:38,680
What luck!

956
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:41,320
I'm sure you'll give me
wonderful advice.

957
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:43,280
Welcome, Giulietta!

958
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:48,400
Once I dreamt of you
in a kind of church.

959
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:51,440
You were up front,
at a desk like the teacher's desk.

960
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:54,320
And I was in the last row,
dressed as a nun.

961
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:58,160
You said, "Show me how you walk!"
So I walked like this.

962
01:15:58,240 --> 01:16:00,880
You flunked me.
How I cried!

963
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,320
I woke up in tears.

964
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:07,200
Come to our party Saturday,
and bring your husband, of course.

965
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:11,600
I've watched you both from my window
and grown fond of you.

966
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:13,760
I would love to be able
to love one man that way.

967
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:16,680
This is my grandmother.

968
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:18,600
She hasn't slept in five years.

969
01:16:18,680 --> 01:16:21,840
She's always up here.
She sees everything.

970
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:25,320
Granny Olga, this is my friend
Giulietta. Do you like her?

971
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:27,600
What's wrong, my dear?

972
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:30,960
She scares me when she says
things like that.

973
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:33,680
She only has to look at you
and she knows your secrets.

974
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,160
- Everything passes.
- Good-bye, signora.

975
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:43,520
How is she?

976
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:47,120
A little better, I think,
but I heard crying all night.

977
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:50,160
Excuse me a moment.

978
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:53,200
Arlette, it's me.

979
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:56,720
Arlette, please.

980
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:00,360
Giulietta, come here.

981
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:09,720
You haven't touched
anything on your plate.

982
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:12,880
Know what I'll do?
I'll phone signora Artemia!

983
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:15,720
She won't stand
for any nonsense.

984
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:19,480
Come on, sit up.

985
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:22,800
Sit up, or I'll tell Roby
to go away.

986
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:30,320
Don't worry.

987
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:33,120
She's a friend of mine,
and she loves you. Right, Giulietta?

988
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:36,000
Of course.

989
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:40,280
Here, drink a little of this.

990
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:47,240
Why won't you believe
that we all love you?

991
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:51,080
I'll come back
and see you later.

992
01:17:58,280 --> 01:18:00,000
What's wrong with her?

993
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:02,240
She tried three times
to commit suicide.

994
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:04,840
The last time we saved her
by a miracle.

995
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:07,120
I called and called,
but no one answered.

996
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:10,320
We broke down the door.
What a mess!

997
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:14,080
She's ill-fated in love.
I keep her here now.

998
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:16,280
Like Laura, a school friend
of mine.

999
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:18,920
She jumped into a canal.
She was 15.

1000
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:21,600
They said it was an accident...

1001
01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:24,760
but it was suicide.
She did it for love.

1002
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:28,120
Take this one.
It even has feathers.

1003
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:34,000
What are you doing here?
I'm fed up!

1004
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:37,960
But I told him.
I said, "She'll be furious. "

1005
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:40,880
Didn't I tell you?

1006
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,600
How dare you come sneaking
up here?

1007
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:45,280
Taking my things!

1008
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:47,520
He only took a slipper!

1009
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:49,520
This is my house,
and I give the orders here!

1010
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:52,320
Otherwise I'll send you back
to the streets where I found you!

1011
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:56,520
- This one was in a whorehouse.
- You know you'd like to be in one.

1012
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:00,720
And why not?

1013
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:03,720
The dirty tales she tells.

1014
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:06,440
All made up, naturally.

1015
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:09,040
We're only joking, of course.
What else can we do?

1016
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:16,520
Giulietta, how are you?

1017
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:19,280
Iris keeps her promise,
you see.

1018
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:22,720
Suzy is your teacher.
Listen to her. Follow her.

1019
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:25,320
I mustn't encourage
your fetishism, Alyosha...

1020
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:27,400
because this is fetishism,
pure and simple.

1021
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:31,400
Momy explained it all to me.
But here, you can have this.

1022
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:45,120
It can't be easy
being a fetishist.

1023
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:47,880
For a Russian,
it must be terrible.

1024
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:49,800
Come look!

1025
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:55,360
How many times
I've watched you in your garden.

1026
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:06,000
Come here, Giulietta.

1027
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:09,560
Look!

1028
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:12,200
Do you have a mirror
on your ceiling too?

1029
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:15,560
Like it?

1030
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:21,680
I had it put there.
Momy was delighted.

1031
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,840
It's like having
another couple along.

1032
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:29,840
What must you think of me!

1033
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:33,080
But, you know,
men like funny things.

1034
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:45,280
Come on in, the water's warm.

1035
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:47,600
Another idea of mine.

1036
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:50,640
After we make love,
we plunge in here.

1037
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:52,520
It's wonderful!

1038
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:54,920
Come on, Giulietta.
Take off your clothes.

1039
01:20:56,080 --> 01:21:00,040
Once Momy slid down headfirst
and he almost got stuck.

1040
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:03,720
Come on, dive in!

1041
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:51,520
I burn my candle on both ends.
I deny myself nothing.

1042
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:53,440
Look, what's up there?

1043
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:55,560
I eat, dance, play...

1044
01:21:55,960 --> 01:21:57,080
and fight.

1045
01:21:57,200 --> 01:21:59,160
I especially like to fight.

1046
01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:03,040
We'll go take some sun.

1047
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:11,240
Up there...

1048
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:14,000
it's much better
than the beach.

1049
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:17,520
It's my private sun.
All mine.

1050
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:21,920
The switch is on that tree.

1051
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:26,680
- We're going up there?
- Certainly. Flip the switch.

1052
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:35,080
In Greece there's
a hilltop monastery.

1053
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:37,520
The monks ride like this.

1054
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:46,480
Send it back.

1055
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:48,720
Do I raise the switch?

1056
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:52,080
That's it!
Now it's your turn.

1057
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:11,920
- Ready?
- Yes.

1058
01:23:13,680 --> 01:23:16,160
Don't be afraid.

1059
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:25,720
If you're dizzy,
close your eyes.

1060
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:43,760
Give me your hand.

1061
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:45,480
No, thanks,
I can manage myself.

1062
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:46,720
They can look all they want.

1063
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:49,720
They'll never find us.

1064
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:51,280
We've thrown them off.

1065
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:53,160
Who?

1066
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:56,840
Those two boys following us.
Didn't you see them?

1067
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:04,280
Yesterday there were two lovers
in those bushes.

1068
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:06,160
How they made love!

1069
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:09,360
I felt like applauding,
they were so wonderful.

1070
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:12,880
From here it seemed so delicate,
so festive.

1071
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:16,760
Is your head still spinning?
Let's have something to drink.

1072
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:20,200
The sun's at its zenith,
the loveliest time.

1073
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:22,160
At this hour
you cast no shadow.

1074
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:24,000
Ah, rainwater...

1075
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:26,680
with two minnows in it.

1076
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:32,080
Sit down. Take off your clothes.
We'll sunbathe nude.

1077
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:35,000
No, thanks. I'm fine like this.

1078
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:38,920
Granny makes strange perfume
out of resin and flowers.

1079
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,560
I'll let you try them out.

1080
01:24:40,680 --> 01:24:42,360
They make men drunk.

1081
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:44,160
An engineer once--

1082
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:46,600
What were you telling me
about your marriage?

1083
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:48,520
Oh, no, nothing.

1084
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:50,240
Don't you trust me?

1085
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:54,160
- Yes, but--
- Well, then? Tell me about it.

1086
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:57,880
You've never thought
of marrying?

1087
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:06,520
I always thought marriage
should be like this.

1088
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:08,440
I would be all his,
and he would be all mine.

1089
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:13,240
I'm almost ashamed to admit it,
but Giorgio was my first love.

1090
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:16,280
I fell in love
the moment I saw him...

1091
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:19,600
and wanted nothing else
but to live with him.

1092
01:25:19,720 --> 01:25:23,560
When he proposed, I was so happy
I almost didn't believe it.

1093
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:26,640
He became my entire world... .

1094
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:29,160
my husband, my lover...

1095
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:30,480
my father, my friend...

1096
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:31,840
my home!

1097
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:35,720
I didn't need anybody else.

1098
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:40,400
I thought that was right,
and I was happy.

1099
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:54,080
Could they be at the beach?
They've vanished.

1100
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:55,800
There they are, up there!

1101
01:25:56,280 --> 01:25:59,240
- What are you doing?
- See? They found us.

1102
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:00,640
Naughty boys!

1103
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:03,520
We have something important
to tell you.

1104
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:06,400
- Do you know them?
- Never saw them before.

1105
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:09,120
Tell me more about your marriage.
It's such a beautiful story.

1106
01:26:09,680 --> 01:26:12,160
I was engaged once at 13.

1107
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:15,240
Oh, I dropped it!

1108
01:26:18,120 --> 01:26:21,720
Excuse me, Suzy, but it's late.
I'd better get home.

1109
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:24,920
What, you're going already?

1110
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:31,360
Send me down, please.

1111
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:34,280
Bye, Giulietta.
Come up whenever you like.

1112
01:26:45,880 --> 01:26:47,320
Hello. How are you?

1113
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:54,280
- You're leaving? Stay with us.
- No, thank you.

1114
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:04,080
I'll get off at the first floor.

1115
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:32,920
"Among the trials
was that of the labyrinth...

1116
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:35,040
which was the worst.

1117
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:39,160
The labyrinth was a great palace
which, once you entered...

1118
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:40,840
you could never leave again.

1119
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:43,880
You wandered and went in circles
until finally you were lost. "

1120
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:47,760
Teresina, what's wrong?

1121
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:49,840
I'm depressed.

1122
01:27:51,960 --> 01:27:54,680
May I leave a little early today?

1123
01:27:55,680 --> 01:27:58,240
"But Jack the Giant-Killer, who wasn't
afraid of even the devil himself...

1124
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:01,800
said, 'I'll enter the labyrinth. '"

1125
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:03,880
Yes, you can go, Teresina.

1126
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:07,320
"But what will you give me
if I succeed in coming out again?"

1127
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:09,760
But I really don't like
your new habit...

1128
01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:12,080
of leaving every day
between 3:00 and 8:00.

1129
01:28:13,400 --> 01:28:17,280
"So they crossed a forest
full of golden apples...

1130
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:21,720
so many apples
shining so brightly...

1131
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:24,880
that even at night
the forest was full of light. "

1132
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:28,360
- Is the lady of the house in?
- This is she. Who is this?

1133
01:28:28,440 --> 01:28:29,880
Eagle Eye Detective Service.

1134
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:31,880
Just a moment, please.

1135
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,960
Go play outside.
I'll be right there.

1136
01:28:38,240 --> 01:28:41,560
Can you visit our office
this afternoon?

1137
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:43,400
Today?

1138
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:45,520
No... I don't know.

1139
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:47,680
Have you already
found something?

1140
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:50,320
We've had seven days
of hard work.

1141
01:28:50,440 --> 01:28:52,760
You'll appreciate our labors.

1142
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:54,840
Can't you tell me
over the phone?

1143
01:28:54,960 --> 01:29:00,680
- Frankly, it's not our custom to do so.
- Of course not.

1144
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:02,600
We'll expect you in our office.

1145
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:04,400
I'll do my best to be there.

1146
01:29:10,640 --> 01:29:13,760
Good afternoon, signora.
We've done it!

1147
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:17,320
I can honestly report
our results are brilliant.

1148
01:29:18,040 --> 01:29:21,160
I think we'll reveal
what you want to know.

1149
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:23,720
I understand your anxiety,
dear lady.

1150
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:27,480
But believe me, there's nothing
final or irreparable.

1151
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:30,480
Please, make yourself
comfortable.

1152
01:29:31,640 --> 01:29:35,280
If you knew how many couples
have reconciled right here--

1153
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:36,880
A drink, signora?

1154
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:41,200
True love requires
a total knowledge of each other.

1155
01:29:41,560 --> 01:29:43,120
Even Saint Augustine said so.

1156
01:29:43,240 --> 01:29:45,400
- Don't consider this a sad occasion.
- No, thank you.

1157
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:52,280
The exposure may not be perfect
on these images...

1158
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:56,880
but you can imagine
the working conditions.

1159
01:29:57,880 --> 01:30:01,600
These are the first three days of our
investigation, the 23rd to the 25th.

1160
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:05,600
If you'll allow me,
I'll read you the report.

1161
01:30:05,680 --> 01:30:09,240
"On the 23rd,
the subject went out at 7:30...

1162
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:10,920
dressed in a white suit.

1163
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:14,680
We trailed his car
to a florist. "

1164
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:22,920
Needless to say, we have all
the relevant information on the woman...

1165
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:27,960
who received the floral arrangement,
which is at your complete disposal.

1166
01:30:31,320 --> 01:30:32,760
There she is!

1167
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:35,160
Captured while entering
a restaurant.

1168
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:39,480
Alas, the hat brim prevents
identification of the person.

1169
01:30:44,680 --> 01:30:47,040
What I always recommend
to my clients...

1170
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:50,600
is a certain detachment
from what we show them.

1171
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:54,240
Our point of view is objective
and hence limited.

1172
01:30:54,520 --> 01:30:56,800
The reality might be
something else...

1173
01:30:56,880 --> 01:30:58,760
more innocent.

1174
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:03,640
This is Lake Bracciano, isn't it?

1175
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:05,800
No, it's a field near Castelli.

1176
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:07,560
"On the 24th...

1177
01:31:07,680 --> 01:31:11,440
an afternoon drive
on the Appian Way.

1178
01:31:11,560 --> 01:31:15,320
They were parked in the fields
from 4:20 till 6:00. "

1179
01:31:16,360 --> 01:31:18,920
The lady's name
is Gabriella Olsen.

1180
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,760
She's 24 years old,
a model by profession.

1181
01:31:24,120 --> 01:31:26,720
While we change reels,
let's see some slides.

1182
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:31,760
I took these myself.

1183
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:35,880
We recorded
their conversation...

1184
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,600
when they stopped
in the park.

1185
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:43,320
You mistake me
for someone else.

1186
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:45,120
When we met you had--

1187
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:54,520
You should be flattered
by what I'm telling you.

1188
01:31:54,640 --> 01:31:57,760
I'm showing you like an idiot
how jealous I am.

1189
01:31:57,840 --> 01:32:00,320
- What would you change in me?
- You're perfect.

1190
01:32:02,160 --> 01:32:05,160
The interpretation of this
is up to you.

1191
01:32:05,240 --> 01:32:08,080
"As agreed herein, the evidence
remains sealed in our keeping...

1192
01:32:08,160 --> 01:32:13,880
unless specifically requested
by the court or the judge. "

1193
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:17,360
You gave us 100,000 lira
for our expenses and equipment...

1194
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:20,840
transportation, per diem,
extras, overtime and so on.

1195
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:24,320
Here's an itemized invoice
for you.

1196
01:32:24,720 --> 01:32:28,360
Believe me, we gave you
very special treatment.

1197
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:34,760
Thank you.

1198
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:36,200
Good day.

1199
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:39,640
My compliments, signora.

1200
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:43,120
My coworkers join me
in saying...

1201
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:46,440
we hope this situation
ends happily, and as you wish.

1202
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:16,080
Look, it's your charming neighbor.

1203
01:33:19,880 --> 01:33:22,600
I knew you'd come.
How are you?

1204
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:25,160
Did you pack your husband
off to bed?

1205
01:33:27,720 --> 01:33:29,960
Listen, Suzy,
when will we begin?

1206
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:33,400
He's not home yet.
My husband is always late.

1207
01:33:33,640 --> 01:33:36,040
He works so hard.

1208
01:33:36,240 --> 01:33:40,120
So I came alone.
He trusts me completely.

1209
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:41,800
He shouldn't!

1210
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:47,040
You already know my mother.
Don't wake her.

1211
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:48,680
She'll start singing!

1212
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:55,840
He can rely on the advice
of the prophet for his moves!

1213
01:33:55,960 --> 01:33:58,880
Momy, this is Giulietta.

1214
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,920
Thank you for honoring my house.

1215
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:06,720
Do you realize who he is?

1216
01:34:07,160 --> 01:34:10,360
That's my boyfriend Momy.

1217
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:12,120
He's 65 years old...

1218
01:34:12,240 --> 01:34:14,640
but he wants to make love
every day.

1219
01:34:14,760 --> 01:34:16,240
And he does!

1220
01:34:19,880 --> 01:34:22,920
What's the matter?
You look so sad.

1221
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:26,880
Me, sad? I'm perfectly fine.

1222
01:34:27,440 --> 01:34:30,240
In fact, I want to enjoy myself.

1223
01:34:30,360 --> 01:34:31,480
Good!

1224
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:34,160
I feel like hugging everyone.

1225
01:34:35,960 --> 01:34:37,640
I want you to be happy.

1226
01:34:58,520 --> 01:35:02,200
Attention, please.
This is the most secret part.

1227
01:35:04,720 --> 01:35:07,600
Now, the deceased
has captured the winds...

1228
01:35:07,720 --> 01:35:10,680
and each maiden becomes
a symbol of purification.

1229
01:35:11,120 --> 01:35:13,560
This is
the old Egyptian rite...

1230
01:35:13,680 --> 01:35:16,400
for the passage
from life to death.

1231
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:20,640
I'm the goddess of vice.

1232
01:35:20,720 --> 01:35:22,840
An hour with me
might kill you...

1233
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:26,320
but you'd have touched
the heights and depths of pleasure.

1234
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:28,400
This is my hour!

1235
01:35:28,520 --> 01:35:32,720
I reach my peak of desire
at 11:00.

1236
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,040
It's a game we play
in Lola's honor.

1237
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:40,160
We create the atmosphere
of a brothel.

1238
01:35:40,720 --> 01:35:41,760
Amusing.

1239
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:44,600
Then you look into his eyes.

1240
01:35:44,720 --> 01:35:47,600
This one,
with the beautiful big nose.

1241
01:35:50,200 --> 01:35:52,360
The gentleman
hasn't chosen yet?

1242
01:35:52,440 --> 01:35:53,840
Lola, is this all right?

1243
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:55,720
That's perfect.

1244
01:35:55,800 --> 01:35:58,920
- I make an offer: a week in Japan.
- Shame on you!

1245
01:35:59,040 --> 01:36:00,880
- All right, then, two weeks.
- Tightwad!

1246
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:02,760
- But in Japan!
- It's too little.

1247
01:36:06,360 --> 01:36:09,120
- Kneel down! What's your name?
- Hildegard.

1248
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:11,760
No, your name is Sex.
What's your name?

1249
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:15,240
No, now your name is Womb.
What's your name?

1250
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:19,400
No, now your name
is that of the goddess.

1251
01:36:19,960 --> 01:36:21,880
Now you are no longer yourself.

1252
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,320
You are the door, the earth.

1253
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:27,400
And now the resting place
of the goddess.

1254
01:36:30,280 --> 01:36:33,040
You're very pretty.
Are you a model?

1255
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:38,800
Do you know
a certain Gabriella?

1256
01:36:38,920 --> 01:36:40,880
- Who?
- Gabriella Olsen.

1257
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:42,240
I know her.

1258
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:45,000
- They say she's very pretty.
- Yes.

1259
01:36:45,080 --> 01:36:46,320
Much prettier than me?

1260
01:36:47,280 --> 01:36:48,800
Very pretty!

1261
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:54,640
And something of a whore,
right?

1262
01:36:54,760 --> 01:36:56,720
You can tell me.

1263
01:36:57,080 --> 01:37:00,200
For me, it's become almost
a compliment.

1264
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:23,040
Do I play the part well?

1265
01:37:23,160 --> 01:37:25,280
Isn't she perfect, Lola?

1266
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:32,520
That's my godson.
Isn't he handsome?

1267
01:39:58,160 --> 01:40:00,960
Giulietta, I'm up here.

1268
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:03,200
Come on.

1269
01:40:20,120 --> 01:40:21,520
Go away!

1270
01:40:32,360 --> 01:40:33,760
What do you want?

1271
01:40:47,400 --> 01:40:49,080
He's waiting.

1272
01:40:49,200 --> 01:40:51,080
He wants you.

1273
01:41:27,280 --> 01:41:29,240
The champagne.

1274
01:42:41,360 --> 01:42:42,920
Suzy is your teacher.

1275
01:42:43,040 --> 01:42:45,320
Listen to her. Follow her.

1276
01:42:49,640 --> 01:42:51,640
Perhaps I drank too much.

1277
01:42:54,800 --> 01:42:56,680
What are you doing?

1278
01:43:48,880 --> 01:43:50,400
I'm hours late, huh?

1279
01:43:50,480 --> 01:43:52,080
- How are you?
- Have you seen Giulietta?

1280
01:43:52,160 --> 01:43:55,360
No, I haven't seen her.
Where are you going dressed like that?

1281
01:43:55,440 --> 01:43:56,840
To your confirmation?

1282
01:43:56,920 --> 01:43:59,800
- What are you doing?
- She's psychoanalyzing my wife.

1283
01:43:59,920 --> 01:44:02,080
Is the American doctor here?

1284
01:44:02,680 --> 01:44:05,880
Now go and concentrate.
Stay in there and try to remember.

1285
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:07,960
I want to see what happens
when it's your turn.

1286
01:44:11,480 --> 01:44:12,680
Dangerous!

1287
01:44:13,320 --> 01:44:16,720
- I know you're afraid.
- No, Giorgio, for goodness' sake!

1288
01:44:18,600 --> 01:44:22,160
To every psychodrama
each person must bring the truth.

1289
01:44:22,280 --> 01:44:26,960
We must create a climate
of absolute verity.

1290
01:44:27,560 --> 01:44:30,320
I'm really not very good
at this.

1291
01:44:30,600 --> 01:44:34,320
Try and relive for us the time
you scolded your son-in-law.

1292
01:44:36,680 --> 01:44:38,440
Will you be the son-in-law?

1293
01:44:38,560 --> 01:44:42,600
- He's too old!
- Thanks for the compliment.

1294
01:44:42,680 --> 01:44:45,040
Let's try this handsome
young man.

1295
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:47,280
He'll be much better.

1296
01:44:47,400 --> 01:44:49,080
Excuse me.
I was reading his palm.

1297
01:44:52,920 --> 01:44:54,640
The future doesn't interest me...

1298
01:44:54,800 --> 01:44:58,480
only what happens to me
today, right now!

1299
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:05,120
Forgive me.
I won't do it again!

1300
01:45:06,680 --> 01:45:08,800
Signora, they're waiting
for you.

1301
01:45:09,800 --> 01:45:11,320
I'm coming.

1302
01:45:15,640 --> 01:45:18,920
That's enough! Leave me alone.
Leave me alone!

1303
01:45:52,400 --> 01:45:54,360
Shameless liar!

1304
01:45:54,600 --> 01:45:56,880
I'll never believe you again.

1305
01:45:57,160 --> 01:45:58,760
Go away!

1306
01:45:59,480 --> 01:46:00,840
Go away!

1307
01:46:03,120 --> 01:46:04,520
Who are you talking to?

1308
01:46:05,120 --> 01:46:06,480
Nobody.

1309
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:08,720
- Who were you talking to?
- Nobody.

1310
01:46:15,560 --> 01:46:17,560
Come on, Giulietta,
we're all waiting.

1311
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:20,600
Doctor, let me do
a psychodrama.

1312
01:46:20,920 --> 01:46:22,560
There's a shady episode
in my life.

1313
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:34,040
- You want a drink?
- No, thanks. I don't drink.

1314
01:46:34,640 --> 01:46:37,440
Dr. Miller's been showing us
a new game: psychodrama.

1315
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:41,640
You relive your worst moments,
projected onto another person.

1316
01:46:42,440 --> 01:46:43,560
Interesting, huh?

1317
01:46:44,080 --> 01:46:46,680
What a strange crowd
you have here, today.

1318
01:46:52,240 --> 01:46:53,480
Cheers!

1319
01:46:54,040 --> 01:46:55,600
Your housecoat's pretty.

1320
01:46:55,720 --> 01:46:57,840
Your eyes are red.
You've been crying.

1321
01:46:58,880 --> 01:47:01,920
I find these games
extremely boring.

1322
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,400
Don't take a plane
on the 27th.

1323
01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:06,920
Ah, the mistress of the house!

1324
01:47:07,360 --> 01:47:08,600
How pretty you are!

1325
01:47:08,720 --> 01:47:11,080
Of course, with such
a pretty mama.

1326
01:47:11,200 --> 01:47:13,200
Want to bet it's a boy?

1327
01:47:13,920 --> 01:47:15,560
Remember, I predicted it.

1328
01:47:15,640 --> 01:47:17,560
Giulietta, psychodrama is not
a game.

1329
01:47:17,680 --> 01:47:20,560
Why don't you try,
little sad face?

1330
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:23,680
Quiet, it's Giulietta's turn.

1331
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:27,240
- Maybe Giulietta doesn't want to.
- Yes, I want to. I'm fine.

1332
01:47:27,320 --> 01:47:28,920
She wants to.

1333
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:32,360
It's a marvelous experience.
You'll feel psychologically liberated.

1334
01:47:32,920 --> 01:47:35,520
Like seeing yourself in a mirror
right there in front of you.

1335
01:47:36,760 --> 01:47:39,400
You'll understand
your problems in no time.

1336
01:47:39,600 --> 01:47:42,280
Tell us about the most painful episode
of your life.

1337
01:47:42,840 --> 01:47:46,480
Recreate for us
the people, the circumstances.

1338
01:47:48,400 --> 01:47:50,000
Is it true?

1339
01:47:51,760 --> 01:47:53,720
Can you really help me?

1340
01:47:59,760 --> 01:48:01,720
There, they've started again!

1341
01:48:06,120 --> 01:48:07,800
Go away!

1342
01:48:08,960 --> 01:48:10,640
Go away!

1343
01:48:12,640 --> 01:48:15,600
- What were you saying?
- Nothing. It's just a game.

1344
01:48:15,720 --> 01:48:17,360
Give me that.

1345
01:48:17,640 --> 01:48:21,680
Try to smoke less...
and have faith in your doctor.

1346
01:48:22,720 --> 01:48:24,400
Can't you see them?

1347
01:48:24,520 --> 01:48:26,080
Can't you hear them?

1348
01:48:27,480 --> 01:48:28,880
Take your revenge!

1349
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:32,320
Forgive!
But whom should I listen to?

1350
01:48:32,400 --> 01:48:34,920
Make yourself beautiful.
Life is all sacrifices.

1351
01:48:35,040 --> 01:48:37,920
Be more feminine,
we'll teach you.

1352
01:48:38,040 --> 01:48:41,000
My life is full of people
who talk, talk, talk.

1353
01:48:41,080 --> 01:48:44,080
Go away, all of you!

1354
01:49:00,440 --> 01:49:02,000
It's water.

1355
01:49:03,200 --> 01:49:06,640
When I want purity
and absolute sincerity...

1356
01:49:07,160 --> 01:49:08,880
I ask for water.

1357
01:49:08,960 --> 01:49:11,440
We need simple things to live.

1358
01:49:11,720 --> 01:49:13,800
Things which hide nothing.

1359
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:16,640
Water is like a truthful gaze.

1360
01:49:17,520 --> 01:49:19,600
Never be afraid of the truth.

1361
01:49:19,720 --> 01:49:21,640
The truth sets us free.

1362
01:49:23,400 --> 01:49:26,720
What does it matter
what others think, anyway?

1363
01:49:28,280 --> 01:49:32,360
There's a proverb in my country:
"l am mine own roof and hearth.

1364
01:49:32,480 --> 01:49:34,160
My words are my food.

1365
01:49:34,480 --> 01:49:37,560
My thoughts are... my drink.

1366
01:49:37,680 --> 01:49:39,560
Thus I am happy. "

1367
01:49:41,600 --> 01:49:43,720
Are you real or not?

1368
01:49:43,880 --> 01:49:46,080
What do you advise?

1369
01:49:46,200 --> 01:49:48,080
What should I do?

1370
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:52,720
I can't advise you.
I only want for you to live fully.

1371
01:49:57,720 --> 01:49:59,040
Where's Giorgio?

1372
01:49:59,120 --> 01:50:01,440
Giulietta, you know
what he said?

1373
01:50:07,960 --> 01:50:09,880
I'm sorry, signora.
I forgot to tell you.

1374
01:50:09,960 --> 01:50:11,400
Your husband left.

1375
01:50:11,520 --> 01:50:14,440
He didn't want to interrupt
your dancing.

1376
01:50:14,760 --> 01:50:17,480
He said to say good-bye to the guests.
He had somebody arriving from Brazil.

1377
01:50:17,560 --> 01:50:19,840
He may not be home
for supper.

1378
01:50:20,040 --> 01:50:21,640
But he said he'd call.

1379
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:29,960
Giulietta, listen
to my advice.

1380
01:50:30,080 --> 01:50:32,960
Proof of adultery
is no longer required.

1381
01:50:33,040 --> 01:50:35,920
Circumstantial evidence
is enough for the law.

1382
01:50:36,520 --> 01:50:38,760
I speak now
not as your lawyer...

1383
01:50:38,880 --> 01:50:42,360
but as a friend who cherishes
and loves you.

1384
01:50:43,440 --> 01:50:46,120
Is there any chance for me?

1385
01:50:47,120 --> 01:50:50,200
You must consider
these things.

1386
01:50:56,760 --> 01:51:00,000
I'm bold enough to think
I know your trouble.

1387
01:51:00,080 --> 01:51:01,720
I may be able to help you.

1388
01:51:01,960 --> 01:51:05,360
You identify too much
with your problem.

1389
01:51:11,080 --> 01:51:15,600
These great trees make the most
impressive symbol of this way of living.

1390
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:18,040
Deeply rooted in the earth...

1391
01:51:18,480 --> 01:51:21,840
yet the branches stretch out
in all directions.

1392
01:51:22,160 --> 01:51:24,880
Their growth is spontaneous.

1393
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:27,720
This is the great
and simple truth you must learn:

1394
01:51:27,880 --> 01:51:30,120
Be yourself, spontaneously...

1395
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:34,680
without fighting your desires
and passions.

1396
01:51:35,440 --> 01:51:37,640
Don't you feel
how nice it is here?

1397
01:51:37,720 --> 01:51:40,480
Sometimes one must speak
out loud...

1398
01:51:41,160 --> 01:51:44,200
even if it's a stranger
who's listening.

1399
01:51:45,360 --> 01:51:47,800
Stretch out on the grass.

1400
01:51:47,920 --> 01:51:51,720
Relax.
Don't be afraid.

1401
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:56,600
Look at the sun
through the branches.

1402
01:51:56,720 --> 01:51:59,840
All is at peace.
All is serene.

1403
01:52:01,800 --> 01:52:04,840
But you, you're not at peace.

1404
01:52:05,440 --> 01:52:06,800
Why?

1405
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:10,480
I don't know.

1406
01:52:10,600 --> 01:52:12,520
What are you afraid of?

1407
01:52:13,120 --> 01:52:14,920
May I answer for you?

1408
01:52:15,320 --> 01:52:17,640
You're afraid of being alone...

1409
01:52:17,720 --> 01:52:19,360
of being abandoned.

1410
01:52:19,880 --> 01:52:22,240
You're afraid your husband
will leave you.

1411
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:25,160
But, really, that's what
you most want.

1412
01:52:25,240 --> 01:52:28,240
You desire with all your might
to be left alone.

1413
01:52:28,360 --> 01:52:30,240
You long for your husband
to go away.

1414
01:52:32,720 --> 01:52:35,120
I want Giorgio to leave me?

1415
01:52:37,920 --> 01:52:42,440
Precisely. Without Giorgio,
you begin to breathe, to live.

1416
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:44,320
You become yourself.

1417
01:52:45,200 --> 01:52:47,400
You think you're afraid.

1418
01:52:47,640 --> 01:52:50,000
But in fact
you fear only one thing:

1419
01:52:50,800 --> 01:52:52,800
You're afraid of being happy.

1420
01:52:56,880 --> 01:52:59,080
Signorina Gabriella Olsen.

1421
01:52:59,240 --> 01:53:02,080
She's not here,
but she should be back soon.

1422
01:53:03,960 --> 01:53:06,400
Excuse me, I was just
cleaning up a bit.

1423
01:53:06,600 --> 01:53:09,960
She phoned around noon to say
that she'd be out for lunch.

1424
01:53:10,080 --> 01:53:12,200
She's out a lot these days.

1425
01:53:12,280 --> 01:53:14,840
Please sit down.
May I offer you something?

1426
01:53:16,320 --> 01:53:19,400
Excuse me, but I have to finish
packing her suitcases.

1427
01:53:23,440 --> 01:53:27,400
The poor girl has waited so long
to take this trip with her boyfriend.

1428
01:53:27,560 --> 01:53:29,600
Everything was all ready.

1429
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:32,800
But he calls at the last minute
and says, "We can't leave now. "

1430
01:53:33,040 --> 01:53:36,240
Not out of meanness,
'cause he's a real gentleman.

1431
01:53:36,360 --> 01:53:39,640
I've never seen anyone
so in love with signora Gabriella.

1432
01:53:41,280 --> 01:53:43,240
And I must say she deserves it.

1433
01:53:44,480 --> 01:53:47,120
I shouldn't say this,
since we're related...

1434
01:53:47,240 --> 01:53:49,480
but they're so sweet together.

1435
01:53:50,600 --> 01:53:53,280
He says he feels at home here.

1436
01:53:54,160 --> 01:53:56,840
He chose all these things
himself.

1437
01:53:57,160 --> 01:53:59,800
All in good taste.

1438
01:54:09,040 --> 01:54:10,800
Yes, I'm packing
your suitcases now.

1439
01:54:10,920 --> 01:54:13,800
There's a lady waiting to see you.
I don't know.

1440
01:54:13,920 --> 01:54:15,600
I don't know her.

1441
01:54:17,960 --> 01:54:19,600
Shall I put her on?

1442
01:54:20,120 --> 01:54:23,280
Would you like to speak
to signora Gabriella?

1443
01:54:23,400 --> 01:54:24,840
I certainly do.

1444
01:54:24,960 --> 01:54:26,920
Just a moment.

1445
01:54:27,240 --> 01:54:29,800
Go ahead and pick up.

1446
01:54:29,880 --> 01:54:31,280
The telephone is behind you.

1447
01:54:48,200 --> 01:54:49,640
Hello. Who is this?

1448
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:51,520
I'm Giorgio's wife.

1449
01:54:51,600 --> 01:54:55,080
Delighted to meet you,
but did we have an appointment?

1450
01:54:55,200 --> 01:54:57,640
No, but I want to talk to you.

1451
01:54:57,960 --> 01:55:00,800
May I be of help?
Can't you tell me on the phone?

1452
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:02,400
I'll wait here.
I'm in no hurry.

1453
01:55:02,480 --> 01:55:05,440
It's no use...
I mean, for you to wait.

1454
01:55:05,520 --> 01:55:08,400
I have a busy afternoon.
I'll be late.

1455
01:55:09,080 --> 01:55:10,960
Are you afraid?

1456
01:55:11,080 --> 01:55:13,200
Afraid? No.

1457
01:55:13,360 --> 01:55:15,880
But I don't enjoy gloating
over the defeat of others.

1458
01:55:16,080 --> 01:55:18,280
And I don't think we have anything
to say to each other.

1459
01:55:18,360 --> 01:55:20,520
Good-bye and good luck.

1460
01:55:21,240 --> 01:55:22,800
I'm not moving.

1461
01:55:31,880 --> 01:55:33,960
I have to go now.

1462
01:55:35,560 --> 01:55:39,160
I think signora Gabriella
will be very late.

1463
01:55:41,800 --> 01:55:44,120
I'm sorry, but--

1464
01:56:10,960 --> 01:56:12,320
Good evening, signora.

1465
01:56:12,400 --> 01:56:15,440
I'm fixing supper for signor Giorgio
because he has to leave.

1466
01:56:17,800 --> 01:56:18,720
Our happiness...

1467
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:20,520
Put the bags in the car.

1468
01:56:20,600 --> 01:56:22,640
... has only one name.

1469
01:56:23,480 --> 01:56:26,280
I'm going to Milan.
I'll eat and run.

1470
01:56:26,400 --> 01:56:29,920
- I'll fix it for you.
- Don't bother. Teresina's doing it.

1471
01:56:44,400 --> 01:56:45,880
Did you add salt?

1472
01:56:48,760 --> 01:56:50,960
What did you make
for a vegetable?

1473
01:56:51,600 --> 01:56:53,000
Some salad.

1474
01:56:58,880 --> 01:57:00,440
It's ready, sir.

1475
01:57:06,960 --> 01:57:09,600
- Is the car trunk unlocked?
- Yes.

1476
01:57:10,480 --> 01:57:12,160
I'll put the bags in.

1477
01:57:25,800 --> 01:57:27,680
This is the first time
you've packed your bags yourself.

1478
01:57:33,040 --> 01:57:35,640
You haven't forgotten anything?

1479
01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:37,760
No, I don't think so.

1480
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:39,480
Will you be gone long?

1481
01:57:40,680 --> 01:57:42,760
I don't know, a couple of days.

1482
01:57:42,840 --> 01:57:44,520
I'll call you.

1483
01:57:48,760 --> 01:57:50,760
Shall I close the windows?

1484
01:57:52,800 --> 01:57:55,440
May I go out for a while?

1485
01:58:13,800 --> 01:58:16,680
Listen, Giulietta,
I may be gone longer.

1486
01:58:17,040 --> 01:58:18,920
I don't feel very well.

1487
01:58:19,240 --> 01:58:21,600
I saw the doctor today.
I didn't tell you.

1488
01:58:33,320 --> 01:58:36,400
- Do you want some fruit?
- Yes, thank you.

1489
01:58:50,320 --> 01:58:53,160
Perhaps work has tired me out
lately.

1490
01:58:54,280 --> 01:58:56,440
The doctor said
nothing's wrong...

1491
01:58:57,200 --> 01:58:59,000
but a rest
would do me good.

1492
01:59:00,680 --> 01:59:03,800
Frankly, I need
some time alone.

1493
01:59:22,320 --> 01:59:24,840
At last we have the pleasure
of meeting you!

1494
01:59:24,960 --> 01:59:26,680
Giulietta has told us so much
about you.

1495
01:59:26,760 --> 01:59:29,280
You're much better
than we imagined.

1496
01:59:29,520 --> 01:59:32,680
Mama, this is
Giulietta's fiance.

1497
01:59:33,720 --> 01:59:35,120
How do you do?

1498
01:59:40,720 --> 01:59:44,160
I think you've heard
malicious gossip...

1499
01:59:44,520 --> 01:59:46,480
mean tongues, rumors.

1500
01:59:46,640 --> 01:59:50,280
Yes, it's true, I've had
a friendship with this person...

1501
01:59:50,400 --> 01:59:53,080
even a deep friendship,
but nothing more.

1502
01:59:53,680 --> 01:59:57,120
I assure you, nothing final
or irreparable.

1503
01:59:57,760 --> 02:00:00,680
The truth is... I don't know.

1504
02:00:01,240 --> 02:00:04,800
I'm going through a moment
of uncertainty, of confusion...

1505
02:00:05,520 --> 02:00:07,280
I want to be alone.

1506
02:00:22,200 --> 02:00:23,920
Well, good-bye, Giulietta.

1507
02:00:40,040 --> 02:00:41,560
I'll phone you.

1508
02:00:42,120 --> 02:00:43,800
Yes, of course.

1509
02:00:44,240 --> 02:00:46,600
- I'll call you as soon as I get there.
- All right.

1510
02:00:47,200 --> 02:00:49,520
I'm not sure when.
Perhaps tomorrow.

1511
02:00:50,480 --> 02:00:53,000
Ah, put my mail aside.

1512
02:00:53,200 --> 02:00:55,120
Of course, the mail.

1513
02:02:41,720 --> 02:02:45,320
Giulietta,
do you remember me?

1514
02:02:46,360 --> 02:02:47,280
Laura!

1515
02:02:49,160 --> 02:02:51,440
Do as I did!

1516
02:02:51,800 --> 02:02:56,200
Here everything
is gray stillness and silence.

1517
02:02:57,120 --> 02:02:59,440
Come with me, Giulietta.

1518
02:03:01,040 --> 02:03:03,080
A long sleep.

1519
02:03:03,200 --> 02:03:05,480
No more suffering.

1520
02:03:49,240 --> 02:03:50,840
It's not true!

1521
02:03:50,960 --> 02:03:54,000
None of you exist!
Go away!

1522
02:04:10,880 --> 02:04:12,520
Very tasty!

1523
02:04:15,520 --> 02:04:18,840
You don't exist!
Go away!

1524
02:04:26,640 --> 02:04:29,560
It's your friend Laura
who killed herself for love.

1525
02:04:35,320 --> 02:04:38,680
Buy a horse, take long rides
and swims.

1526
02:04:42,400 --> 02:04:44,280
Is there any hope for me?

1527
02:04:44,720 --> 02:04:47,880
Without Giorgio,
you'll begin to breathe...

1528
02:04:48,080 --> 02:04:49,640
to be yourself.

1529
02:04:49,720 --> 02:04:53,480
Spent the whole evening with me,
the whole evening with me.

1530
02:04:58,680 --> 02:05:01,440
I can't get down.
I can't land.

1531
02:05:01,520 --> 02:05:04,000
It's your fault, Giulietta.

1532
02:05:07,600 --> 02:05:08,800
A long sleep...

1533
02:05:53,400 --> 02:05:56,240
Mama, please help me!

1534
02:06:07,800 --> 02:06:09,240
I hear crying.

1535
02:06:09,360 --> 02:06:11,240
It's the wind.

1536
02:06:14,480 --> 02:06:16,680
- They're calling me.
- Don't move.

1537
02:06:17,480 --> 02:06:19,160
- Obey your mother.
- I must go.

1538
02:06:19,280 --> 02:06:20,840
Don't you move!

1539
02:06:24,720 --> 02:06:27,240
Who is it?
Who are you?

1540
02:06:27,320 --> 02:06:28,520
Open!

1541
02:06:28,640 --> 02:06:30,080
Don't open!

1542
02:06:30,200 --> 02:06:31,640
Obey me!

1543
02:06:33,120 --> 02:06:35,480
You no longer frighten me.

1544
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:52,160
Look who's here!
My little beef patty!

1545
02:07:52,520 --> 02:07:54,680
Where'd you leave your grill?

1546
02:07:54,800 --> 02:07:57,640
Let's say good-bye
to those bores.

1547
02:08:21,520 --> 02:08:23,800
My cutie's waiting for me.

1548
02:08:23,880 --> 02:08:25,640
We have to go too.

1549
02:08:25,720 --> 02:08:27,880
Take me along!

1550
02:08:28,880 --> 02:08:29,800
Where?

1551
02:08:30,880 --> 02:08:32,520
This is an old plane...

1552
02:08:32,600 --> 02:08:34,360
going nowhere.

1553
02:08:34,440 --> 02:08:36,280
It was only meant
to come here.

1554
02:08:44,240 --> 02:08:45,800
Good-bye, Giulietta.

1555
02:08:47,160 --> 02:08:48,920
Don't try to hold on to me.

1556
02:08:49,640 --> 02:08:51,600
You don't need me anymore.

1557
02:08:52,680 --> 02:08:55,080
I'm nothing but another
of your inventions.

1558
02:08:55,880 --> 02:08:57,720
But you are life.

1559
02:08:59,120 --> 02:09:00,200
So long, beef patty!

1560
02:09:47,360 --> 02:09:49,640
- Who are you?
- Friends.

1561
02:09:50,160 --> 02:09:52,960
- Who are you?
- True friends.

1562
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,840
Now, if you like,
we can stay.

1563
02:09:59,400 --> 02:10:01,440
Do you want us to?

1564
02:10:01,520 --> 02:10:05,280
Listen! Listen well!
