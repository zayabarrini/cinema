<i>Corinthians, my life</i>

3
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,436
<i>Corinthians, my story</i>

4
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:20,936
<i>Corinthians, my love</i>

5
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,066
<i>Kick-off at the Morumbi stadium!</i>

6
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:46,595
<i>- Delivery for apartment 14.
- Wait in the cage.</i>

7
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:53,102
Your autograph here, man.

8
00:02:58,478 --> 00:02:59,035
Thanks.

9
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:12,755
<i>And it's a rough foul</i>

10
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:15,795
<i>for the Sâo Paulo team.</i>

11
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:16,955
Asshole!

12
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:20,379
<i>It's as if it were</i>

13
00:03:20,414 --> 00:03:22,260
<i>a penalty shot.</i>

14
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:25,736
Corinthians fans are on edge here.

15
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:28,036
<i>The team could be relegated.</i>

16
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:31,440
<i>It's a great suffering</i>

17
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:32,677
<i>for the fans.</i>

18
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,203
<i>A moment of great anxiety...</i>

19
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:41,147
Oh Lord, Almighty...

20
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:46,523
Keep working miracles
in our homes...

21
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,021
Thank you, Father...

22
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:54,231
I was troubled, I was lost...

23
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:55,329
Hallelujah!

24
00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:58,035
Let us praise the Lord

25
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:02,268
With a hymn...

26
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:07,172
Amen, Lord. Glory be to Jesus.

27
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:11,080
<i>I want to tell you</i>

28
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:14,984
<i>that you are</i>

29
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:20,849
<i>so important to God</i>

30
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:25,622
<i>suffer not your anguish and pain</i>

31
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:29,632
<i>stop feeling inferior</i>

32
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:31,369

33
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:34,771
<i>you're no one</i>

34
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:37,704
<i>I am here to speak</i>

35
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:41,737
<i>of the strength you have within</i>

36
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:46,011
<i>the love you have within</i>

37
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:49,849
<i>the Holy Spirit moves inside you</i>

38
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:17,382
Felipe!

39
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,016
Good morning, everybody.

40
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,354
Good morning, coach.

41
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:32,590
Before we start, listen
to what I'm going to say.

42
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,499
Any idea how many kids are after
a place here?

43
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:39,431
Hundreds of thousands...

44
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:45,672
But this is not the street.

45
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:46,670
Out there

46
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:48,371
it's dog-eat-dog.

47
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,812
But not here...
We've got rules here.

48
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:53,447
You show off, you get cut.

49
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,649
You hog the ball, you're out.

50
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:58,216
Rough fouls, you're out.
Understood?

51
00:05:58,825 --> 00:05:59,917
Yes, sir.

52
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,688
Soccer is team work.

53
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:17,239
Go, son!

54
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,294
Fucking shit!

55
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:16,524
Over here!

56
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:18,565
Pass the ball!

57
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:19,795
Pass the ball!

58
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:22,775
You wanna play by yourself,
play solitaire!

59
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:24,772
Ball-hog!

60
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:51,865
Everything alright?

61
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:54,203
Fine.

62
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:56,739
This kid inside...

63
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:01,981
Doesn't wanna get off.
He's made four rounds with me today.

64
00:08:02,016 --> 00:08:03,481
Got no family.

65
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:07,509
They let them
wander around loose...

66
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:13,285
If you paid attention
to what I said earlier, you'll get it.

67
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,193
I really hope next time
you have better luck. Okay?

68
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,896
I'm only keeping three today.

69
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:23,061
This kid here, him and the goalie.

70
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:26,230
You others are free to go.
Thanks. Good luck!

71
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:27,601
Shower!

72
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:30,068
And you, pal.

73
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,438
You like to hog the ball.

74
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:35,010
You should eat three balls
before you come to the field.

75
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:37,805
You play well, but with that attitude,
you won't go far.

76
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:40,979
May

77
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,744
- Come on, dude.
- Fuck off.

78
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:55,154
If they had tryouts
for the elderly, huh?

79
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:59,897
I'd make the cut for sure!

80
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:03,163
- The Ace is back.
- The ball, Ace.

81
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:04,098
Dickhead.

82
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:06,202
The Ace is all violence.

83
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,198
The Ace holds the ball.

84
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,893
Dario stands up...

85
00:10:11,928 --> 00:10:13,510
Come on, pony-tail.

86
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:14,743
To Denis.

87
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:15,643
Back to Dinho.

88
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:16,477
To Dario.

89
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:18,680
To Dinho.

90
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:21,144
Denis traps the ball...

91
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:23,346
To Dario, maybe...

92
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:25,987
Dinho traps it, turns

93
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:27,893
and it's a goal!

94
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:29,761
And what a goal!

95
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:33,022
"Cidade Líder" is delirious.

96
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:35,062
This goal is for Jesus.

97
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:37,661
- Sure, Athlete for Christ.
- Pure luck, son-of-a-bitch.

98
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,899
If I'm a son-of-a-bitch,
you are, too.

99
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,375
- Are you fucking crazy, dude?
- Sorry, man. I missed the shot.

100
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:47,902
Missed it?
Fucking asshole.

101
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:48,845
It's a goal!

102
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:52,280
- Where you been this late?
- None of your business.

103
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:55,880
Show respect
to your older brother, man.

104
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:59,318
Brother, my ass.
I'm no son of a cuckold.

105
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:02,422
Son-of-a-bitch!

106
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:04,554
Who's the son of a cuckold, huh?
Say it!

107
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:06,288
Say it, you fucking bastard.

108
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:09,802
- Go look for your daddy, twerp.
- Stop!

109
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:12,505
- Speak up, little bastard.
- Stop!

110
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:15,174
- Your daddy's the cuckold.
- Stop!

111
00:11:15,209 --> 00:11:15,765
Enough!

112
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:20,769
- Where you been out so late?
- Here and there.

113
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,072
- You have a home, you know?
- Yeah, I know.

114
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:29,483
Corinthians in Minor League, bro.

115
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:31,886
Worse: Corinthians in Mini-League!

116
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:35,824
You looking for a beating?

117
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:40,222
You don't think it's funny?

118
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,128
Asshole!

119
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,169
Reginaldo! watch your mouth!

120
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,363
Pain in the ass, dude.

121
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:46,936
Let it go, Denis.

122
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:52,372
Dario!

123
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:53,744
Let him be, Mom.

124
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,543
He's pissed off because of the tryouts.

125
00:11:57,783 --> 00:11:58,977
Fucking peg-leg.

126
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:01,577
Leave me alone!

127
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:24,375
He's blacker than me, isn't he?

128
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:31,714
If I'm this black,
he must be black as coal.

129
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,680
Give me that. I'll finish it.
Go to bed, go on.

130
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:46,708
<i>Hey, check out the dude, bros.</i>

131
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:49,160
Dinho, what's with the suit, man?

132
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:51,026
Don't speak to the sinners no more?

133
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,590
Hey dude! I'm talking to you.

134
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,591
Hey, fuckhead.

135
00:13:56,836 --> 00:14:00,863
You a bible boy now, huh?
Once a lowlife, always a lowlife, bro.

136
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:03,170
Butthead.

137
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:07,712
Quiet, Gandhi!

138
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:08,902
Reginaldo!

139
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:11,782
You all alone again?

140
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:13,075
You poor thing!

141
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:15,816
And the little brother,
When's he due?

142
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:18,886
Prick.

143
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:38,742
Cleuza! Should I push you,
or can you fall out yourself?

144
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:40,372
God forbid, Dona Estela!

145
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:42,004
Don't say that!

146
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:43,715
Aren't you asking for it?

147
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,142
Don't you want your windows cleaned?

148
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:50,484
Sure, but I don't want anyone killed.
Climb down, Cleuza, please.

149
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:54,684
Whatever you say...

150
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,555
Didn't I buy you a squeegee?

151
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:01,562
- No, you didn't.
- Odd...

152
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:05,995
I thought I'd told you
I meant to buy a squeegee.

153
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,274
Age has its advantages.

154
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:13,641
Name one, Arlindo.

155
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:17,473
- At 18, you can...
- Go tojail.

156
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:18,781
That, too.

157
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:23,412
I wish I were 18 now, kid.

158
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:29,956
- 18 is the end of the line.
- Don't say that!

159
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:35,132
Okay, the tryouts are over.
But soccer's no exact science.

160
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:39,170
Garrincha started playing
for Botafogo at 19.

161
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:41,604
Garrincha...

162
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:50,716
Ah, tell Cleuza I can't make it
to your party.

163
00:15:50,751 --> 00:15:51,375
What party?

164
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:55,017
Shit...

165
00:15:57,656 --> 00:16:02,525
Fucking shit.

166
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:07,356
Dinho!

167
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,239
What's that in your ear?
You a playboy now?

168
00:16:14,274 --> 00:16:14,772
You deaf?

169
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,434
Sorry, I was listening
to the commentary.

170
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:20,536
The soccer wrap-up?
Don't waste your time, man.

171
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:22,774
Santos is going to blast
you off the field.

172
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:24,409
Tell them I said so!

173
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,582
- I was just going inside to close up...
- Good. Put that shit away.

174
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:34,185
Hey Bible boy!
Soccer belong to God, too?

175
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:35,785
Sure.

176
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:37,929
So who did Jesus
root for, then?

177
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:41,391
Get back to work.

178
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:49,938
Need help?

179
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:52,402
No, it's okay.

180
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:55,339
Hey, help yourselves to snacks.

181
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:58,441
I'll serve the others.

182
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,083
Dario will be here soon.

183
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:14,892
Do it, bro.

184
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:16,924
<i>They're sick of being faithful,</i>

185
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:19,730
<i>sick of being wives.</i>

186
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:23,537
<i>They'd rather be the other one.</i>

187
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:25,173
You rot.

188
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,913
<i>Tell me what you want.</i>

189
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:36,887
<i>I want to be the other one!</i>

190
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:40,522
<i>You're the wife.</i>

191
00:17:40,557 --> 00:17:42,288
<i>You're bored.</i>

192
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:46,797
Beautiful!

193
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:47,856
<i>I want to be the other one!</i>

194
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:09,019
Surprise parties are tricky.
Sometimes they backfire.

195
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:13,013
I must have spent
a hundred bucks on this party.

196
00:18:13,058 --> 00:18:14,558
A hundred?

197
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:18,764
I bought the pastries from Luzia
and she gave me the cake.

198
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,098
Don't forget my snacks.

199
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:23,931
Were you planning to charge her
for this shit?

200
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:25,761
Hello.

201
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:28,731
Hey, Dario!

202
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:32,271
For the love of God.

203
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:37,704
Dario's here!

204
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:55,761
Happy birthday!

205
00:18:55,796 --> 00:18:57,491
Lights out!

206
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,126
Come on, Dario.

207
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:03,597
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

208
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:12,150

Next.

243
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,092
Look, shithead.

244
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:41,963
Fuck!

245
00:21:57,849 --> 00:22:00,374
- Fill'er up, dude.
- The money?

246
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:02,748
- In my pocket.
- Can I see it?

247
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:04,816
Don't trust me, bro?

248
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:15,090
Got 10,000 gallons in there.
Come on... just two, three.

249
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,326
No.

250
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:19,600
Chicken shit.

251
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:51,299
Guys,

252
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:52,694
change fast.

253
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:54,903
Let's go, move it.

254
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,099
The next group now, you all ready?

255
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:02,943
I wanna see some soccer!

256
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:04,376
I've seen nothing yet.

257
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:08,348
The tryout is on...

258
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,081
all I've seen is garbage.

259
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:25,126
And the fucker misses it...

260
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:41,543
- Zero skill...
- That's bad, man.

261
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,812
Let's get this over with.

262
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:51,822
Lay out thejerseys.
Red here, blue there.

263
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:54,391
The coach will talk to you.

264
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:56,558
Hey, thanks for the effort

265
00:23:57,335 --> 00:23:59,860
but unfortunately
I can't keep anybody.

266
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:01,188
God bless you

267
00:24:01,223 --> 00:24:02,405
and good luck.

268
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,475
Now, you, come on over.

269
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:08,412
Split up in groups.

270
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,972
Reds over here. Blues over there.

271
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:12,413
Blues over there.

272
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:16,152
You all know what
you're here for, right?

273
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:18,813
Try to play as a team even
though you don't know each other.

274
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:22,585
I want to see the best
of you! Good luck!

275
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:37,002
Turn, turn the game.

276
00:24:51,356 --> 00:24:52,653
Turn, turn...

277
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:00,695
Go, go!

278
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,458
Where's the defense?

279
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:13,100
- Beautiful goal.
- That kid is good, pony-tail.

280
00:25:42,407 --> 00:25:43,169
Círio...

281
00:25:49,147 --> 00:25:53,481
Come on, kiddo. It's your dad,
not the boogieman. Shit!

282
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:07,563
I thought the kid
had seen the devil.

283
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,125
Very funny!

284
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:12,235
Can I come in?

285
00:26:13,471 --> 00:26:14,130
Come in.

286
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:17,970
- Your mother there?
- No, she's at work.

287
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:24,608
Hey, you got a pen?

288
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,517
No pen?

289
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:30,047
A courier without a pen!
That's funny!

290
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:32,587
Gimme a break, Bianca,
it fell out of my pocket.

291
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:34,588
A pen: It's basic, no?

292
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:41,926
Where do I sign?

293
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:45,226
Sig-na-tu-re!

294
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:52,499
It's been two months
since you left a cent, you know?

295
00:26:52,877 --> 00:26:57,507
In three months I pay off the bike
and I'll bring in some cash.

296
00:26:58,483 --> 00:27:00,178
If they don't steal this one too.

297
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:04,050
Get off my case, dude.

298
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:07,356
Bring the kid to say goodbye,
I gotta split.

299
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:12,953
Better not. He was up all night
With a fever.

300
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:15,590
If you want,
I'll take you to the clinic.

301
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,099
It's taken care of.
I'll kiss him for you, OK?

302
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:36,176
- The worse is you still kiss good.
- I am good.

303
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,749
What about a motel?

304
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:41,584
I'd rather you left money
for the kid's medicine.

305
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:00,407
It's raining cats and dogs.

306
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,246
I'm broke, I'm late.

307
00:28:05,281 --> 00:28:08,012
What you mean, stalling?

308
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:17,860
You make eight reais an hour?
I only make five, dude.

309
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,343
You've got a lot of nerve, kid!

310
00:28:32,944 --> 00:28:35,936
Throw this ID away
or you'll end up injail.

311
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:39,516
You saw me play.
Give me a chance, coach.

312
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:43,544
You play well, but there's lots
like you and they're only 15!

313
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:45,153
Time is tough on an athlete.

314
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:11,009
Mechanic.
One year experience.

315
00:29:21,993 --> 00:29:23,426
Assistant Accountant.
One year experience.

316

317
00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:36,705
June

318
00:30:05,703 --> 00:30:09,332
- I was just going to get them.
- No problem.

319
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:13,809
I found this money
in Bruno's pockets.

320
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:17,409
Thank you, Cleuza,
put it in his bedroom.

321
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,050
- Care for some coffee?
- Sounds good.

322
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:41,101
- Here it is, nice and hot.
- Good!

323
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:44,472
I was peeking...

324
00:30:44,742 --> 00:30:48,940
Bruno's playing in the rain.
He'll get sick.

325
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:52,174
He's a big boy.

326
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:55,114
Besides, he's the one
who'll enjoy the flu, not me.

327
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,382
Thanks. Sit down, Cleuza.

328
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,120
Come on, sit down.

329
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:11,665
Excuse me.

330
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:35,256
Hey, kid, watch out.

331
00:31:57,115 --> 00:32:01,211
- Anything wrong with my work?
- I didn't say that.

332
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:04,710
I just thought it'd be better for you
to stay home.

333
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:10,395
Three months after the baby is born
you can come back.

334
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:12,693
Dona Estela, don't do this to me.

335
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,767
Oh, God! I have a patient in 20 minutes.
I have to go.

336
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:24,903
Hey, dudes!

337
00:32:27,812 --> 00:32:28,608
Hi, Gloria.

338
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:33,140
You disappear. Not a word.
You rich, now?

339
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:38,484
I'm fucking broke, babe.
I need more work!

340
00:32:38,823 --> 00:32:42,623
Anything, anywhere.
Just say the word, I'll go.

341
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,418
Okay, I'll see.

342
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:47,624
Babe?

343
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:50,159
Ain't I your favorite?

344
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:55,197
Go wait out there
With my twenty other favorites.

345
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:58,772
Great.

346
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:01,645
What's up?

347
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:04,280
Cool?

348
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:06,283
Wake up, dickhead.

349
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:09,454
Stop it, Bruno.
I don't know if he can.

350
00:33:09,489 --> 00:33:11,621
He has practice...

351
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,753
I'm desperate, Cleuza.

352
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:16,726
I promised the guys.
It's for the championship!

353
00:33:17,228 --> 00:33:19,560
I know what you want.
There. Take it.

354
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:21,031
One more.

355
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:24,032
Now go do your homework,
'cause soccer's not your thing.

356
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:27,995
Sometimes we waste so much time

357
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:31,356
dreaming of foolish things...

358
00:33:31,391 --> 00:33:34,573
We'd like to own. Things...

359
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:36,204
that keep us away from Jesus.

360
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:43,846
For example, we spend 12 months
paying for... a sofa!

361
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:46,214
Isn't that true?
Who hasn't done that, right?

362
00:33:46,557 --> 00:33:52,757
Every month we pay

363
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:58,296
for a sofa we hardly ever sit on.

364
00:33:58,336 --> 00:34:01,362
That's why I ask you, sister.

365
00:34:01,572 --> 00:34:03,563
Does your house belong to you?

366
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:04,733
No.

367
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:06,800
- Who does it belong to?
- To Jesus.

368
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:12,482
This land isn't ours, brothers.

369
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:16,821
This land belongs to... Jesus!

370
00:34:16,856 --> 00:34:18,220
Hallelujah.

371
00:34:56,527 --> 00:34:59,155
- Who came in?
- The star.

372
00:34:59,797 --> 00:35:04,291
Dario, how did the tryouts go, son?

373
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:18,877
Jesus, Reginaldo!

374
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:22,110
What's with your hair!
You look like a bum!

375
00:35:22,153 --> 00:35:24,678
- Can you fix nigger hair?
- Of course you can.

376
00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:33,789
- Can you fix his hair too?
- I'll get the belt right now!

377
00:35:33,998 --> 00:35:37,268
- At least he left his belt!
- You uppity little nigger.

378
00:35:37,303 --> 00:35:39,896
Come back here, Reginaldo!

379
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:27,806
You warming up the engine?

380
00:37:27,845 --> 00:37:28,504
What?

381
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:32,375
- You warming up the engine?
- No, loading the compressor.

382
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:38,884
I've seen you on my bus.
You ride the bus a lot.

383
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:41,824
- I like it.
- Takes all kinds.

384
00:37:44,795 --> 00:37:47,025
- Why do you start in second?
- What?

385
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:50,032
What's the low for,
if you always pull away in second?

386
00:37:50,067 --> 00:37:52,831
Low is too short, it's tiring.

387
00:37:57,708 --> 00:37:58,800
Can you show me how to drive?

388
00:37:59,844 --> 00:38:00,970
Step on the clutch.

389
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:03,158
Right there. Harder.

390
00:38:03,193 --> 00:38:04,738
Now shift into low.

391
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:06,674
Low or second?

392
00:38:06,717 --> 00:38:10,710
First you learn it right,
then you do whichever way you want.

393
00:38:10,988 --> 00:38:14,856
Low, back to second, forward to third,

394
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:16,591
back to fourth,

395
00:38:16,827 --> 00:38:19,455
and fifth here on the right.

396
00:38:19,597 --> 00:38:22,930
Rear, you shift into neutral
and pull it towards you.

397
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:27,002
Good job, kiddo!

398
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,968
Great fit! Perfect.

399
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:39,482
Keep the cleats, dude.

400
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:41,010
And we're all even.

401
00:38:42,086 --> 00:38:43,713
Won't your mom be pissed off?

402
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:46,214
She doesn't give a shit, dude.

403
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:47,518
Really?

404
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:49,691
Cool, man.

405
00:38:52,463 --> 00:38:55,728
Good ball, good ball!

406
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:03,000
Pass the ball.

407
00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:04,733
Bruno!

408
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:08,701
That's fucking unfair.

409
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,083
Dario!

410
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:37,633
You fucking crazy, dude!

411
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:41,111
I'll get my maid's kid
to play for our team, too.

412
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,172
Son-of-a-bitch!

413
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:46,447
Motherfucker!

414
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:50,017
Shit!

415
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:58,160
What an asshole, this Raul.

416
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:03,033
All set. wanna check
the oil and water?

417
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:03,761
Sure, go ahead.

418
00:40:13,644 --> 00:40:15,578
- Hey, Dinho.
- I'm working, Denis.

419
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:16,705
Come on, bro, just a sec.

420
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:24,182
Dude, I'm short on cash.
There's this babe. Can you lend me some?

421
00:40:24,221 --> 00:40:25,381
Everything all right, sir?

422
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:30,759
Yo, if you plan to fill up, okay.
Otherwise get lost.

423
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:33,931
- Easy, bro, I wasjust.
- I'm not your "bro", man.

424
00:40:33,966 --> 00:40:35,366
Just move, you're in the way.

425
00:40:35,401 --> 00:40:36,924
You dissing me, dude?

426
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:40,019
This is no motorcycle stop, man. Out!

427
00:40:40,054 --> 00:40:43,071
I'm no bum.
Fill up the fucking tank.

428
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:43,869
Can I pay?

429
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:45,976
Take the man's card, go!

430
00:40:46,011 --> 00:40:47,000
Get lost, beat it.

431
00:40:47,511 --> 00:40:48,671
Say again, bro?

432
00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:05,527
Sorry, sir.

433
00:41:12,536 --> 00:41:17,074
- Could be worse, could be 0-0...
- This tournament sucks, man.

434
00:41:17,109 --> 00:41:20,874
- Corinthians down to Minor?
- Don't say that!

435
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:24,378
Lmagine me paying to see Corinthians
play against...

436
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:25,941
sorry ass team!

437
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:28,808
Corinthians versus Hawaii.

438
00:41:29,286 --> 00:41:31,982
God forbid! I miss...

439
00:41:32,723 --> 00:41:34,770
the good old days.
That was a team!

440
00:41:34,805 --> 00:41:36,818
Sweet Dr. Socrates!
Cheers, Doc!

441
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:39,593
- Aren't you coming home, Mom?
- Hey, Reginaldo!

442
00:41:40,097 --> 00:41:41,962
Go see if I'm out on the corner.

443
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:43,693
Come on, you've had enough.

444
00:41:43,734 --> 00:41:45,634
You go ahead, I'm coming, OK?

445
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,967
You got it from the corner gas station?

446
00:41:50,574 --> 00:41:55,341
That gas is pure water, dude.

447
00:42:48,832 --> 00:42:49,457
Bruno?

448
00:42:50,267 --> 00:42:53,719
- 23rd. Avenue is close, right?
- Sure. why?

449
00:42:53,754 --> 00:42:57,172
I could get off there.
And catch the Beltway.

450
00:42:57,207 --> 00:43:00,904
No, we party tonight, dude.
How long has it been?

451
00:43:00,945 --> 00:43:03,140
You kicked ass,
now it's time to get some ass, dude.

452
00:43:04,114 --> 00:43:05,983
I can take you home later.

453
00:43:06,018 --> 00:43:10,044
Come on, bro...

454
00:43:59,236 --> 00:43:59,998
Sorry.

455
00:44:05,576 --> 00:44:06,440
Good evening.

456
00:44:07,945 --> 00:44:10,675
- Nice to meet you, I'm Dinho.
- Dinho, Gloria.

457
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:14,747
- Denis has done the honors?
- He sure has.

458
00:44:14,785 --> 00:44:18,277
- Some water, sister?
- Cut the crap, she's no church-goer.

459
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,187
But I respect those who are.

460
00:44:20,924 --> 00:44:21,913
We're having some booze.

461
00:44:22,626 --> 00:44:23,524
To Jesus.

462
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:33,599
- Reginaldo been through here?
- Yes.

463
00:44:35,539 --> 00:44:36,563
I came with him.

464
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:47,278
The dudes are making serious money
selling fake acid.

465
00:44:47,317 --> 00:44:50,411
There's a sucker born every minute.

466
00:44:52,056 --> 00:44:55,287
Plain paper and they get real high!

467
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:01,963
What's up, dudes?

468
00:45:02,066 --> 00:45:03,499
Take your seat, bro.

469
00:45:04,168 --> 00:45:07,371
I'm a genius, I'll get the Nobel Prize
for chemistry with this.

470
00:45:07,406 --> 00:45:10,829
The formula: Ecstasy, LSD, and Viagra.

471
00:45:11,241 --> 00:45:12,299
The Holy Trimix!

472
00:45:13,911 --> 00:45:16,779
You can fuck all night with that!

473
00:45:16,814 --> 00:45:20,272
Dario, a smaller hit for you,
for your first time.

474
00:45:24,321 --> 00:45:26,186
Go on, Dario. Trust me.

475
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:39,668
I'll have a snack.

476
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:57,187
You know, I was reading
something, so beautiful.

477
00:45:57,688 --> 00:46:00,486
"Thejoy of having a shepherd... "

478
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:04,189
Give us a break, OK, bro?

479
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:12,401
I'lljust go on in, then.

480
00:46:12,803 --> 00:46:13,936
Our house is yours.

481
00:46:13,971 --> 00:46:15,598
We're poor but we like to share
What we have.

482
00:46:15,973 --> 00:46:17,770
Why, thank you.

483
00:46:17,808 --> 00:46:18,467
Good night.

484
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,999
- Is the sofa free, dickhead?
- No, mofo.

485
00:46:47,538 --> 00:46:51,975
You saw the babe, man.
Hit me with some cash, bro, please!

486
00:46:52,109 --> 00:46:57,147
You fuck me up with the boss
then you ask me for money?!

487
00:46:57,182 --> 00:46:58,978
Your boss is an asshole.

488
00:46:59,049 --> 00:47:02,553
The asshole pays me.
And I'm the only one helping mom here.

489
00:47:02,588 --> 00:47:05,954
Soon as I pay off the bike,
I'll chip in too.

490
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:09,258
Lend me some cash, man.
For the love of Saint Jesus!

491
00:47:16,366 --> 00:47:17,162
Look the other way.

492
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:21,530
Shit, bro.

493
00:47:26,977 --> 00:47:29,912
- I've got 20.
- 20, bro?

494
00:47:29,947 --> 00:47:32,643
What kind of dump motel
can I take her with 20 bucks, man?

495
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:34,913
- You taking her to a motel?
- No, to church!

496
00:47:38,155 --> 00:47:40,316
- Freed up the sofa already?
- Sure, bro.

497
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:44,360
- I love you.
- Now you love me, son-of-a-bitch.

498
00:47:44,394 --> 00:47:45,725
Where'd you get that money?

499
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:48,562
- None of your business.
- Yes it is.

500
00:47:49,266 --> 00:47:52,929
- You know the girl?
- The "ho" from hisjob?

501
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:55,268
Shhh! You know her?

502
00:47:56,073 --> 00:47:58,234
You all hot
for your brother's slut?

503
00:47:58,375 --> 00:47:59,967
Shut up, dickhead.

504
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:02,742
I'm heading for my sofa.

505
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:26,148
Fuck!

506
00:50:27,657 --> 00:50:28,419
You crazy, dude!

507
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:43,828
Dario! Man, look at me.

508
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:45,894
Dinho!

509
00:51:48,071 --> 00:51:50,335
- What's happening?
- Come here, bro.

510
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:51,766
Look at me!

511
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:56,037
Wake up, look at me!

512
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:56,841
What's up?

513
00:51:57,414 --> 00:51:59,211
Look what a mess he's in.

514
00:51:59,549 --> 00:52:02,109
Get up, bro.

515
00:52:02,152 --> 00:52:02,846
Hey Dario?

516
00:52:03,854 --> 00:52:06,922
Let's get him into the shower.
Get up!

517
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:09,991
Keep it down.
Or mom will wake up.

518
00:52:14,164 --> 00:52:16,689
Puke in the bathroom, man.

519
00:52:20,871 --> 00:52:26,138
Dinho, do this for me, okay?
I've been up all night.

520
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:28,172
Head up.

521
00:52:34,518 --> 00:52:37,453
You better?

522
00:52:38,555 --> 00:52:40,455
Let's get you up.

523
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:47,258
Look up.

524
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:09,147
What's going on?

525
00:53:11,421 --> 00:53:12,319
What is this?

526
00:53:13,223 --> 00:53:14,485
Dario's feeling sick, Mom.

527
00:53:15,158 --> 00:53:16,090
Feeling sick?

528
00:53:16,993 --> 00:53:18,085
You been drinking, Dario?

529
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:19,256
No.

530
00:53:21,731 --> 00:53:22,823
How did you get these?

531
00:53:23,767 --> 00:53:24,927
How did you get these?

532
00:53:25,735 --> 00:53:26,724
It's a present.

533
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:27,731
A present?

534
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:32,470
You took money from my drawer
to buy those shoes?

535
00:53:32,642 --> 00:53:37,272
I work my fingers to the bone
for you to steal my money?

536
00:53:37,314 --> 00:53:40,306
- Put this deadbeat to bed.
- Sure, Mom!

537
00:53:57,767 --> 00:54:01,134
Isn't there a man in this house
to unclog this goddamn drain?

538
00:54:05,809 --> 00:54:06,867
I'm in doubt.

539
00:54:07,177 --> 00:54:08,337
I'm a failure.

540
00:54:09,879 --> 00:54:12,347
You know I'm slipping away.

541
00:54:14,117 --> 00:54:15,209
I'm no one.

542
00:54:15,785 --> 00:54:18,987
I'm weak.

543
00:54:19,022 --> 00:54:20,011
In God's peace, brother.

544
00:54:22,626 --> 00:54:24,389
Jesus hears your prayers.

545
00:54:26,296 --> 00:54:28,161
I don't think he wants
to hear me, Pastor.

546
00:54:28,365 --> 00:54:29,559
Don't say that, Dinho.

547
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:35,194
When you accepted Jesus,
Jesus accepted you.

548
00:54:38,341 --> 00:54:39,103
You know, brother.

549
00:54:39,876 --> 00:54:45,337
Three years of struggle
and I've never seen the church so empty.

550
00:54:46,983 --> 00:54:52,353
With the "franchise" church on the corner,
they're alljumping ship.

551
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:54,423
And what for?

552
00:54:55,992 --> 00:55:00,156
To hear washy sermons?
To believe Jesus is nice?

553
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:03,598
Jesus is not nice.
Never was, never will be.

554
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:06,267
I still serve the Lord
in this house, Pastor.

555
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:08,069
Until when?

556
00:55:10,707 --> 00:55:12,800
Shall we pray for those
Who will abandon us?

557
00:55:17,447 --> 00:55:20,245
August

558
00:55:27,257 --> 00:55:29,384
- Good morning, Rosa.
- Morning, son.

559
00:55:29,459 --> 00:55:31,154
- In God's peace.
- Amen.

560
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:33,724
I brought a psalm for us to read.

561
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:36,526
That's good.

562
00:55:42,772 --> 00:55:45,206
"How long wilt thou
forget me, O Lord?"

563
00:55:45,975 --> 00:55:49,206
"How long wilt thou hide thy face
from me?"

564
00:55:52,749 --> 00:55:54,979
"For my days are consumed
like smoke. "

565
00:55:57,287 --> 00:55:58,982
"And my bones burn
like glowing embers. "

566
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:05,392
"My heart is smitten,
and withered like grass;

567
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:08,054
"so that I forget to eat my bread. "

568
00:56:14,304 --> 00:56:16,499
"My days are like the evening shadow;

569
00:56:17,173 --> 00:56:18,936
"I wither away like grass. "

570
00:56:37,127 --> 00:56:38,594
This dog, 15 reais.

571
00:56:49,439 --> 00:56:50,337
Pass the ball.

572
00:56:50,473 --> 00:56:53,340
Reginaldo, pass the ball.

573
00:56:55,011 --> 00:56:56,444
Pass it now.

574
00:57:10,894 --> 00:57:11,986
Pass the fucking ball!

575
00:57:17,066 --> 00:57:19,364
Ball-hog! Let it go!

576
00:57:30,046 --> 00:57:33,450
See what you did, dude?
Little nigger bastard!

577
00:57:33,485 --> 00:57:36,553
- You're the bastard!
- Fuck off, dude.

578
00:57:36,588 --> 00:57:38,885
Pull them away!

579
00:58:07,217 --> 00:58:08,650
Stop with this obsession.

580
00:58:11,921 --> 00:58:17,052
I'm going to call the school
every day to make sure you're there.

581
00:58:18,127 --> 00:58:19,321
You better be there.

582
00:58:20,196 --> 00:58:23,222
All I need is a summons
from Juvenile Court because of you.

583
00:58:30,106 --> 00:58:34,202
If that dumbass calls you a bastard again,
beat the shit out of him!

584
00:58:38,748 --> 00:58:41,148
My little Mike Tyson!

585
00:58:44,654 --> 00:58:45,348
What?

586
00:58:47,457 --> 00:58:49,357
It was me who took the 50 bucks, okay?

587
00:58:51,261 --> 00:58:52,853
From your drawer.

588
00:58:52,896 --> 00:58:54,659
You're a pain, you know?

589
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:56,226
What for?

590
00:58:57,166 --> 00:58:58,155
I bought the sofa.

591
00:59:00,136 --> 00:59:01,228
You bought the sofa?

592
00:59:03,339 --> 00:59:06,001
<i>A garbage collector
can make up to 600 reais a month.</i>

593
00:59:06,075 --> 00:59:10,246
<i>For the 11 days of sign-ups,
even applicants with college degrees</i>

594
00:59:10,281 --> 00:59:11,907
<i>Wait in line, day and night.</i>

595
00:59:12,081 --> 00:59:15,517
<i>The 100,000 applicants
have to take three tests...</i>

596
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:20,613
In the fruit bowI, Reginaldo.

597
00:59:24,994 --> 00:59:28,191
<i>More attacks on buses
in South Side Sâo Paulo.</i>

598
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:30,722
<i>Three buses burned.</i>

599
00:59:32,535 --> 00:59:34,093
<i>The atmosphere is tense...</i>

600
00:59:34,804 --> 00:59:37,372
Scram!

601
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:38,374
You scram, dude.

602
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:42,302
Dario, you've been on that sofa
since morning!

603
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:44,744
Get ajob,
do something with your life!

604
00:59:49,786 --> 00:59:53,688
I've got a hot tip for you:
The sparkplug trick.

605
00:59:53,756 --> 01:00:00,127
Break the tip off, lick it
and hit the windshield.

606
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:03,664
It shatters pronto, dude.

607
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:05,429
That's such bull, bro.

608
01:00:05,501 --> 01:00:07,731
What bull, giant Mop-Head?

609
01:00:08,071 --> 01:00:11,404
The dude may be a mop-head
but he ain't a dork like you.

610
01:00:11,541 --> 01:00:12,742
Who's a dork, dick-face?

611
01:00:12,777 --> 01:00:13,606
You!

612
01:00:13,643 --> 01:00:16,874
What, dude?
Are you two making out?

613
01:00:17,213 --> 01:00:21,884
- No, I'm fucking your sister, that slut.
- Fucking my sister, my ass.

614
01:00:21,919 --> 01:00:23,317
Surely not your ass.

615
01:00:24,354 --> 01:00:28,723
Hey, your back's burning, bro?

616
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:32,351
Dude, this is true love.

617
01:00:32,395 --> 01:00:35,023
He's "punching in" every day.

618
01:00:35,665 --> 01:00:37,326
In due form...

619
01:00:37,367 --> 01:00:39,426
He'll be the boss in no time!

620
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:42,330
Yes, sir.

621
01:00:42,372 --> 01:00:43,304
Sure, boss.

622
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:45,801
Mop-head boss.

623
01:01:04,927 --> 01:01:07,657
You crazy, twerp?
Can't you see me?

624
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:10,265
Go watch your cartoons!

625
01:01:10,299 --> 01:01:13,735
I was watching porn, dickhead.

626
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:15,067
Don't even know what that is.

627
01:01:15,104 --> 01:01:18,801
Hey, blubber-butt.
I've got a hot tip for you.

628
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:22,375
A scout is coming to the sandlot.

629
01:01:22,712 --> 01:01:24,547
Arlindo said to tell you.

630
01:01:24,582 --> 01:01:25,138
When?

631
01:01:25,581 --> 01:01:26,809
Now you wanna know.

632
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:29,041
- Spit it out, man!
- Apologize first.

633
01:01:30,286 --> 01:01:31,947
I'm listening. I'm listening...

634
01:01:38,327 --> 01:01:39,796
Fuck off. Nigger son-of-a-bitch.

635
01:01:39,831 --> 01:01:40,922
Butthead.

636
01:01:41,964 --> 01:01:45,627
Day after tomorrow, deadbeat.
But you have to fix your ID.

637
01:01:49,772 --> 01:01:50,568
Second.

638
01:01:52,008 --> 01:01:52,770
Third.

639
01:02:05,588 --> 01:02:06,520
Clutch.

640
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:08,452
Fourth.

641
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:11,620
Go for it, Reginaldo.

642
01:02:28,044 --> 01:02:28,601
Hello!

643
01:02:30,446 --> 01:02:30,969
Hello.

644
01:02:31,314 --> 01:02:33,942
So, the lady, the missus...

645
01:02:34,217 --> 01:02:36,651
What's her name again?

646
01:02:36,686 --> 01:02:39,085
- Estela.
- Right

647
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:41,583
She told me to introduce myself.

648
01:02:42,525 --> 01:02:43,719
I'm Almerinda.

649
01:02:44,527 --> 01:02:47,621
She told me your name too, but I forgot.

650
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:49,593
- What's your name again?
- Cleuza.

651
01:02:49,632 --> 01:02:50,724
Right! Cleuza.

652
01:02:51,167 --> 01:02:56,935
So, she said you needed a hand
With the belly and all.

653
01:02:58,374 --> 01:03:00,968
- When's the baby due?
- Not for a long time.

654
01:03:14,490 --> 01:03:15,650
Bitch!

655
01:03:18,694 --> 01:03:20,252
She hired somebody else.

656
01:03:20,997 --> 01:03:22,396
Never signed my work papers.

657
01:03:22,565 --> 01:03:25,932
But I'll get a lawyer
and sue her fucking ass!

658
01:03:26,903 --> 01:03:28,029
Don't curse, Ma.

659
01:03:28,404 --> 01:03:33,068
So you're a saint now?
Some fat saint you are.

660
01:03:33,509 --> 01:03:38,105
Think I've forgotten
the trouble you've caused me?

661
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:39,512
I've accepted Jesus, Mom.

662
01:03:39,549 --> 01:03:41,210
Jesus, my ass.

663
01:03:43,953 --> 01:03:46,945
Maybe if you had accepted Jesus,
you wouldn't be as you are now.

664
01:03:47,390 --> 01:03:48,049
Come again?

665
01:03:48,591 --> 01:03:51,890
- You heard me.
- Say it again, I dare you.

666
01:03:52,261 --> 01:03:54,195
Another child whose father
is a mystery to us.

667
01:03:54,230 --> 01:03:55,288
You shut your mouth.

668
01:03:55,731 --> 01:03:59,861
I'm mother and father to you.
Hear? That's me!

669
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:26,491
Go, kid.

670
01:04:28,264 --> 01:04:29,799
Check out number 8.

671
01:04:29,834 --> 01:04:30,595
Dario.

672
01:04:32,001 --> 01:04:33,662
What a steal! See that?

673
01:04:36,005 --> 01:04:37,836
Go, kid, go!

674
01:04:38,741 --> 01:04:41,767
What a goal!

675
01:05:57,153 --> 01:05:59,212
Watch him! Me, here.

676
01:06:05,428 --> 01:06:07,988
End of the second half.
And still hustling, look!

677
01:06:15,838 --> 01:06:17,305
And a team player, see?

678
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:25,845
With him it's always like that, man.

679
01:06:28,451 --> 01:06:34,048
- Well done, Arlindo! Your kid can play.
- I've trained him since he was little.

680
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:36,650
He's at his prime!
Don't miss the chance.

681
01:06:38,728 --> 01:06:40,696
You know it's notjust up to me, right?

682
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:20,468
So, Arlindo, how did the talk go
With the man?

683
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:24,271
If you "tip" him, it's a deal,

684
01:07:24,306 --> 01:07:27,070
if not, you're out...

685
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:29,302
How much of a "tip"?

686
01:07:30,379 --> 01:07:32,677
- Quite a bit
- How much is a bit?

687
01:07:33,816 --> 01:07:35,215
- Three!
- Three what?

688
01:07:37,019 --> 01:07:37,713
Three thousand.

689
01:07:38,554 --> 01:07:39,680
Take it or leave it.

690
01:07:40,589 --> 01:07:42,682
If you pay, you have a deal.
If you don't...

691
01:07:45,594 --> 01:07:46,322
Three thousand?

692
01:07:50,299 --> 01:07:54,633
Three months' pay,
and you're all even.

693
01:07:59,375 --> 01:08:00,399
I'm fucked.

694
01:08:18,594 --> 01:08:19,856
- Good evening.
- Looking good, huh!

695
01:08:19,895 --> 01:08:21,385
Had a stool test?

696
01:09:39,308 --> 01:09:43,938
<i>Police HQ has still not released
the identity of the victims.</i>

697
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:46,512
<i>Condition, still unknown.</i>

698
01:09:47,516 --> 01:09:51,120
<i>Is this an isolated case,
or another wave</i>

699
01:09:51,155 --> 01:09:53,850
<i>of attacks on urban buses?</i>

700
01:09:54,490 --> 01:09:58,119
<i>Public transportation
in Brazil's largest city</i>

701
01:09:58,194 --> 01:09:59,456
<i>is in a state of chaos.</i>

702
01:09:59,695 --> 01:10:03,153
<i>Fleets are taking their buses off
the streets tonight.</i>

703
01:10:03,332 --> 01:10:05,926
<i>The city is once again...</i>

704
01:10:16,912 --> 01:10:19,540
I'm sick of all this.
I'm going back to the country.

705
01:10:19,582 --> 01:10:21,982
To do what? Plant sugar cane?

706
01:10:23,953 --> 01:10:25,887
You're caught between a rock
and a hard place.

707
01:11:20,843 --> 01:11:23,505
<i>I'll kill you!</i>

708
01:11:23,612 --> 01:11:27,776
You were on the bus?

709
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:30,951
<i>I was awake all night
because of you, son of a bitch!</i>

710
01:11:33,422 --> 01:11:36,289
I'll kill the son of a bitch!

711
01:11:36,325 --> 01:11:41,524
Easy, Mom! You'll hurt him!

712
01:12:00,115 --> 01:12:02,310
- Morning, Cida!
- Morning, Cleuza.

713
01:12:02,351 --> 01:12:02,817
- Everything okay?
- Yes, and you?

714
01:12:03,919 --> 01:12:06,717
- So, you watch him for me?
- Of course.

715
01:12:06,755 --> 01:12:10,384
He doesn't leave
for school until noon, okay?

716
01:12:10,426 --> 01:12:13,589
We'll watch cartoons,
right, Reginaldo?

717
01:12:13,629 --> 01:12:14,891
He loves cartoons.

718
01:12:15,564 --> 01:12:18,624
Don't let him go near the dog.

719
01:12:18,667 --> 01:12:21,067
Don't worry.

720
01:12:21,737 --> 01:12:25,468
Bye, I'm late already.
Don't you touch anything!

721
01:12:25,774 --> 01:12:28,436
- Bye, Cida.
- Bye.

722
01:12:29,078 --> 01:12:31,273
Go in!

723
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:34,110
Go!

724
01:12:36,151 --> 01:12:36,845
Gandhi!

725
01:13:00,275 --> 01:13:02,869
Can't you see us?

726
01:13:07,149 --> 01:13:09,049
We're not invisible!

727
01:13:10,552 --> 01:13:12,349
Look, look!

728
01:13:12,588 --> 01:13:14,146
Bastard ran the red light.

729
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:15,823
Ran the fucking red light!

730
01:13:15,858 --> 01:13:17,120
Son of a bitch!

731
01:13:32,474 --> 01:13:36,501
Look what you did, motherfucker!

732
01:13:59,868 --> 01:14:00,926
Fucking shit!

733
01:14:47,783 --> 01:14:48,408
Mom.

734
01:14:51,553 --> 01:14:52,178
Mom.

735
01:14:53,655 --> 01:14:57,113
What, Denis?

736
01:14:57,893 --> 01:15:00,487
- Look what I brought you.
- For me?

737
01:15:01,463 --> 01:15:02,487
A gift?

738
01:15:02,998 --> 01:15:05,125
- Where you going, Reginaldo?
- To the bathroom.

739
01:15:05,567 --> 01:15:08,434
Don't even dream of
going out tonight, you hear?

740
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:22,473
This is beautiful, son! God!

741
01:15:24,019 --> 01:15:26,920
All these pockets.

742
01:15:26,955 --> 01:15:28,923
That's like a coin purse, right?

743
01:15:29,391 --> 01:15:31,916
And for documents here.

744
01:15:33,262 --> 01:15:33,921
What's this?

745
01:15:40,002 --> 01:15:41,731
It's like, I found the bag.

746
01:15:41,770 --> 01:15:44,534
- No stolen stuff in my house.
- I didn't steal the bag!

747
01:15:44,907 --> 01:15:47,374
I just wanted you to have it.

748
01:15:47,409 --> 01:15:49,900
This bag has an owner.
It shouldn't be hard to find.

749
01:15:50,579 --> 01:15:52,604
It is now yours, Dona Cleuza.

750
01:16:34,089 --> 01:16:34,612
Bi?

751
01:16:37,459 --> 01:16:38,050
Bi!

752
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:40,523
<i>- Who is it?
- It's me, open up!</i>

753
01:16:49,938 --> 01:16:51,872
You confuse me, Denis.

754
01:17:06,221 --> 01:17:09,384
September

755
01:17:57,172 --> 01:18:01,165
Give me a hand. With this crazy weather,
thejerseys won't dry.

756
01:18:01,376 --> 01:18:02,343
Sâo Paulo, man.

757
01:18:03,245 --> 01:18:07,807
How's the story
With the man's down payment?

758
01:18:08,216 --> 01:18:10,548
I spoke to my Mom.

759
01:18:11,153 --> 01:18:13,754
She said she'll work it out.

760
01:18:13,789 --> 01:18:18,317
Her employer will give her
an advance or something.

761
01:18:18,393 --> 01:18:20,020
It's not the total, but.

762
01:18:20,062 --> 01:18:21,051
It's something, I guess.

763
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:24,094
You realize that without the money,
no deal, right?

764
01:18:24,132 --> 01:18:25,861
Lt'll work out. Don't worry.

765
01:18:25,967 --> 01:18:29,801
And on Thursday
We'll fuck up those dorks, right?

766
01:18:31,173 --> 01:18:35,576
- That's my ace talking.
- We going to kick some ass, man.

767
01:18:35,977 --> 01:18:37,842
I really need this, bro.

768
01:18:38,146 --> 01:18:40,580
It's a man'sjob, dig?

769
01:18:41,283 --> 01:18:42,807
Then how do you do it?

770
01:18:43,318 --> 01:18:44,342
I pretend, dude.

771
01:18:48,790 --> 01:18:51,623
We can take a drive,
but not on my bike or yours.

772
01:18:51,660 --> 01:18:53,719
Dig it, Valentino Rossi?

773
01:18:58,800 --> 01:18:59,289
Hey...

774
01:19:00,035 --> 01:19:01,525
You still doing the babe there?

775
01:19:02,270 --> 01:19:03,828
Why, you in line, bro?

776
01:19:04,372 --> 01:19:06,863
If she's available,
got to do thejob, right?

777
01:19:07,375 --> 01:19:09,468
- I'd say you could bang her once.
- Once?

778
01:19:12,414 --> 01:19:16,510
- She's kind of weird.
- Weird, what, a transvestite?

779
01:19:16,551 --> 01:19:17,711
You fucking with me, bro?

780
01:19:18,954 --> 01:19:20,444
Be prepared, dig?

781
01:19:21,490 --> 01:19:23,651
- Take some boxing gloves.
- Boxing?

782
01:19:25,727 --> 01:19:27,718
I love boxing, dude.

783
01:19:34,636 --> 01:19:35,796
Check out the clinch!

784
01:19:38,807 --> 01:19:43,767
<i>If thou givest with joy
Thou shalt reign in heaven.</i>

785
01:19:43,945 --> 01:19:49,110
<i>Reign in heaven!
Reign in heaven!</i>

786
01:19:49,317 --> 01:19:54,448
<i>If thou givest with joy
Thou shalt reign in heaven.</i>

787
01:19:54,523 --> 01:19:57,185
What is the difference...

788
01:19:57,225 --> 01:19:58,419
between faith...

789
01:19:58,627 --> 01:20:00,026
and necessity?

790
01:20:00,729 --> 01:20:02,788
Necessity, brothers and sisters,

791
01:20:02,831 --> 01:20:04,458
is man's will.

792
01:20:05,233 --> 01:20:06,962
And faith...

793
01:20:07,235 --> 01:20:09,430
Faith is God's will!

794
01:20:11,673 --> 01:20:13,868
And when you have faith,

795
01:20:14,209 --> 01:20:17,110
When your heart is full of faith,

796
01:20:17,245 --> 01:20:19,440
the Lord makes miracles!

797
01:20:21,383 --> 01:20:24,419
- Isn't it true, brother Dinho?
- It's true. Praise God.

798
01:20:24,454 --> 01:20:30,551
Brother Dinho, bring sister Rosa here.

799
01:20:30,926 --> 01:20:33,258
Brother Mateus,
move your chair please.

800
01:20:33,862 --> 01:20:34,920
Come, sister Rosa.

801
01:20:35,697 --> 01:20:38,427
Oh! Beloved Lord,

802
01:20:38,767 --> 01:20:43,261
light the way for sister Rosa,
give her strength.

803
01:20:43,505 --> 01:20:48,841
Let Jesus lift up your legs, sister.

804
01:20:51,980 --> 01:20:53,242
Have faith,

805
01:20:53,281 --> 01:20:57,149
and you'll walk, sister Rosa!

806
01:20:58,787 --> 01:21:01,984
Hallelujah!

807
01:21:04,526 --> 01:21:11,193
Very often we think
we're 100% faithful to God.

808
01:21:11,333 --> 01:21:13,961
Remember our conversation
about being "100% faithful"?

809
01:21:15,003 --> 01:21:18,890
But we're not.
A little bit of faith is missing.

810
01:21:18,925 --> 01:21:22,777
And this little bit of faith
means a lot to God.

811
01:21:23,278 --> 01:21:26,304
Let's pray for sister Rosa
and praise the Lord.

812
01:22:18,233 --> 01:22:20,724
Here, for your work.

813
01:22:21,469 --> 01:22:22,629
I don't want anything, Pastor.

814
01:22:24,172 --> 01:22:28,336
It's not a handout, brother.
This is your payment.

815
01:22:28,677 --> 01:22:32,169
- It's not much, but it can help.
- Thanks, but you owe me nothing.

816
01:22:33,882 --> 01:22:34,780
I have to go.

817
01:22:36,351 --> 01:22:38,819
- Praise the Lord.
- Praise the Lord, brother.

818
01:22:42,190 --> 01:22:44,124
What's up?

819
01:22:47,562 --> 01:22:49,189
My man here, Japs.

820
01:22:49,731 --> 01:22:51,460
What can I do for you two?

821
01:22:51,633 --> 01:22:52,964
A bike, dude.

822
01:22:53,234 --> 01:22:55,464
Like what?

823
01:22:55,603 --> 01:22:56,467
This one good?

824
01:22:57,005 --> 01:22:58,870
This bike rocks, right?

825
01:22:59,574 --> 01:23:03,977
Dude fell off, bent the sidebars,
I traded the parts.

826
01:23:04,212 --> 01:23:08,512
It's in perfect shape.
I can give you a good deal.

827
01:23:08,550 --> 01:23:10,609
What about a lease?

828
01:24:09,711 --> 01:24:12,805
Hey, Julio, you see this?

829
01:24:17,852 --> 01:24:20,844
This professional team thing
is kind of complicated.

830
01:24:21,222 --> 01:24:25,090
Without an indication from the top,
nothing happens.

831
01:24:25,126 --> 01:24:30,996
- Arlindo explained it to me.
- So we are okay? We got a deal?

832
01:24:31,032 --> 01:24:34,763
His mother's working on it.
She's a serious woman, hear?

833
01:24:34,903 --> 01:24:38,634
She knows more about soccer
than you and me together.

834
01:24:39,774 --> 01:24:43,904
Did you bring some... bread?

835
01:24:43,945 --> 01:24:46,436
No. I mean, not today.

836
01:24:46,614 --> 01:24:49,913
But don't worry. It's a sure deal.

837
01:24:49,951 --> 01:24:51,518
Just a few more days.

838
01:24:51,553 --> 01:24:55,216
My mom is working on it.
Next time I come I'll bring you some.

839
01:24:56,257 --> 01:24:59,522
Which can be Saturday,
We have a big game then.

840
01:24:59,627 --> 01:25:00,787
I can put you on the bench.

841
01:25:01,896 --> 01:25:04,592
Can you stand a few minutes
in the second half?

842
01:25:30,225 --> 01:25:32,659
Asshole! Fuck you!

843
01:25:49,777 --> 01:25:50,801
- Evening!
- Dude.

844
01:25:50,945 --> 01:25:52,105
Fill 'er up, bro.

845
01:25:56,284 --> 01:25:57,216
Look here, bro.

846
01:25:58,353 --> 01:26:01,481
Listen, compadre. What I want
is what's in your pocket, man.

847
01:26:01,523 --> 01:26:04,219
- You'll fuck me over, man.
- None of that, mofo.

848
01:26:04,392 --> 01:26:05,586
The cash, pronto.

849
01:26:12,534 --> 01:26:14,434
I just want the fucking cash.

850
01:26:16,404 --> 01:26:19,841
What a dork, man.
I'm working here. Dickhead.

851
01:26:19,876 --> 01:26:21,365
Take that fucking hose out.

852
01:26:22,844 --> 01:26:24,812
You out of you mind, mofo?

853
01:26:25,647 --> 01:26:28,115
Look back again.
Go ahead, tough guy.

854
01:26:29,117 --> 01:26:31,142
Wanna die? Look now.

855
01:26:31,252 --> 01:26:32,150
Thanks, dork!

856
01:26:44,632 --> 01:26:46,361
You don't speak to me no more,
Reginaldo?

857
01:26:52,607 --> 01:26:56,338
God, what did I do
to deserve sons like these?

858
01:26:58,012 --> 01:27:02,915
I hope this time I get a little girl
to rescue me from you!

859
01:27:05,486 --> 01:27:06,384
Where you going?

860
01:27:07,188 --> 01:27:08,382
Look for my father.

861
01:27:08,957 --> 01:27:12,120
Stop that, Reginaldo.
Go back to your sofa.

862
01:27:17,932 --> 01:27:21,034
Mr. Jefferson, he had a gun!

863
01:27:21,069 --> 01:27:23,403
Gun, my ass. It was your brother.

864
01:27:23,438 --> 01:27:26,174
Don't say that, I'm an honest man.
God is my witness!

865
01:27:26,209 --> 01:27:27,971
You talk about God?

866
01:27:28,006 --> 01:27:29,734
You fucking thief!

867
01:27:29,777 --> 01:27:32,046
You don't know what you're saying.
I'm no thief.

868
01:27:32,081 --> 01:27:34,399
You're a thief,
your brother's a thief.

869
01:27:34,434 --> 01:27:36,717
Go fuck yourself.
You bible bastard.

870
01:27:36,751 --> 01:27:42,712
I give you a decentjob,
you go and steal on me!

871
01:27:47,962 --> 01:27:48,519
Stop!

872
01:29:16,050 --> 01:29:16,914
Edson!

873
01:29:26,094 --> 01:29:26,856
It's Dinho.

874
01:29:30,932 --> 01:29:32,263
Let's get him inside.

875
01:29:40,241 --> 01:29:42,835
I'm going to the game.

876
01:29:43,077 --> 01:29:43,805
No way.

877
01:29:44,045 --> 01:29:46,070
- Of course I'm going.
- No you're not.

878
01:29:46,681 --> 01:29:48,649
It's too far to go with this belly.

879
01:29:48,816 --> 01:29:51,512
I take the bus everyday,
belly and all. No problem.

880
01:29:51,586 --> 01:29:56,956
- You don't go so far.
- Genaro will come with me.

881
01:29:57,625 --> 01:30:01,594
- I'll be on the bench.
- What if he puts you in?

882
01:30:01,629 --> 01:30:05,563
- He won't.
- Imagine if your father could see this?

883
01:30:06,234 --> 01:30:09,032
I can't miss this, son.

884
01:30:09,670 --> 01:30:14,607
- Don't look so disgusted!
- You're really stubborn, dude!

885
01:30:15,510 --> 01:30:18,877
Don't worry. If I go, I go.

886
01:30:19,914 --> 01:30:20,710
But I'm going.

887
01:30:38,132 --> 01:30:38,757
Dinho?

888
01:30:41,736 --> 01:30:42,327
Wake up.

889
01:30:43,404 --> 01:30:45,395
We're going to the baptism.

890
01:30:45,907 --> 01:30:47,602
Come on. wake up.

891
01:30:51,345 --> 01:30:52,141
Reginaldo?

892
01:31:01,556 --> 01:31:02,682
Reginaldo!

893
01:31:19,841 --> 01:31:20,506
I'm going,

894
01:31:20,541 --> 01:31:23,977
'cause I gave the man my word.

895
01:31:25,112 --> 01:31:28,138
But with no money, it's hopeless.

896
01:31:28,749 --> 01:31:30,917
Don't worry, my mom will be there.

897
01:31:30,952 --> 01:31:34,854
- Her word is as good as gold, right?
- Good as gold.

898
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:27,099
Careful!

899
01:33:27,134 --> 01:33:27,998
Don't let him shoot.

900
01:33:38,112 --> 01:33:39,511
We'll react.

901
01:33:40,648 --> 01:33:41,615
We have plenty of time.

902
01:35:38,866 --> 01:35:40,094
Let go, son of a bitch!

903
01:35:40,434 --> 01:35:41,769
Move, move!

904
01:35:41,804 --> 01:35:42,898
Thief!

905
01:36:09,497 --> 01:36:10,122
Fuck!

906
01:36:15,669 --> 01:36:17,296
Gosh, what happened?

907
01:36:18,205 --> 01:36:20,070
Are you hurt?

908
01:36:20,241 --> 01:36:22,766
How can you drive like that
in the city?

909
01:36:23,010 --> 01:36:25,535
Fuck off, asshole!
Look how you drive, bastard!

910
01:36:30,417 --> 01:36:35,354
Get in the car, dude.

911
01:36:35,389 --> 01:36:37,289
Go, go! Are you deaf, asshole?

912
01:36:41,162 --> 01:36:42,094
A monkey?

913
01:36:43,197 --> 01:36:44,095
A monkey.

914
01:36:46,066 --> 01:36:47,124
Show it to mommy.

915
01:36:52,139 --> 01:36:53,470
And that's a doggy.

916
01:37:03,350 --> 01:37:08,185
- Can they see us inside here?
- No, the glasses are dark.

917
01:37:08,222 --> 01:37:10,053
Up there, turn right!

918
01:37:11,926 --> 01:37:14,224
Turn right, dickhead!

919
01:37:14,428 --> 01:37:17,192
Turn right. Right!

920
01:37:18,332 --> 01:37:20,300
Man, I said turn right!

921
01:37:20,968 --> 01:37:22,333
There was a truck behind me.

922
01:37:22,369 --> 01:37:27,238
Why you buy this fucking car for?
To go 15 miles an hour?

923
01:37:39,553 --> 01:37:42,113
- How much time left?
- Fifteen minutes.

924
01:37:44,191 --> 01:37:45,658
Tell the subs to warm up.

925
01:37:46,594 --> 01:37:48,391
Come on, everybody.

926
01:37:56,136 --> 01:37:58,627
Dario, I don't see your mother.

927
01:38:08,515 --> 01:38:09,880
Wellington! Come here.

928
01:38:39,413 --> 01:38:40,846
Brother Jonathan,

929
01:38:41,015 --> 01:38:44,143
do you take Jesus
as your one and only Savior?

930
01:38:45,419 --> 01:38:49,082
I baptize you in the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

931
01:39:10,210 --> 01:39:13,976
I baptize you in the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

932
01:39:24,858 --> 01:39:26,587
Turn right here, dude!

933
01:39:28,228 --> 01:39:30,560
Do it, man! Ain't nojoy ride!

934
01:39:32,066 --> 01:39:34,193
Easy, easy.

935
01:39:37,204 --> 01:39:38,671
Down now, down.

936
01:39:39,773 --> 01:39:42,674
Do it, man, you dissing me?

937
01:39:42,876 --> 01:39:44,503
Fucking old chicken shit!

938
01:39:50,584 --> 01:39:51,573
Stop the car right there.

939
01:39:56,690 --> 01:39:57,714
Turn the engine off.

940
01:39:59,393 --> 01:40:00,917
Turn it off, dickhead!

941
01:40:24,518 --> 01:40:27,553
Take my wallet,

942
01:40:27,588 --> 01:40:31,490
my Palm, cell phone, everything...

943
01:40:31,525 --> 01:40:33,857
- But let me go!
- Look at me, motherfucker!

944
01:40:47,207 --> 01:40:48,196
Do you see me?

945
01:40:50,044 --> 01:40:50,533
What?

946
01:40:53,147 --> 01:40:54,478
Do you see me, asshole?

947
01:41:06,760 --> 01:41:08,694
Get the hell out of here!

948
01:41:10,164 --> 01:41:11,461
Out of here, motherfucker!

949
01:41:58,712 --> 01:42:01,545
Come here, it's your chance.

950
01:42:39,453 --> 01:42:41,751
Bless us over these waters, Lord.

951
01:42:53,700 --> 01:42:56,931
Will you accept Jesus
as your one and only Savior?

952
01:42:58,405 --> 01:43:02,705
I baptize you in the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

953
01:43:05,546 --> 01:43:06,672
Hallelujah, Lord!

954
01:43:15,389 --> 01:43:17,823
Leandro, bring sister Rosa.

955
01:43:57,698 --> 01:43:58,960
Rosa Assunçâo,

956
01:43:59,766 --> 01:44:02,496
do you take Jesus
as your one and only Savior?

957
01:44:03,036 --> 01:44:03,798
I do.

958
01:44:04,404 --> 01:44:09,103
I baptize you in the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

959
01:44:11,678 --> 01:44:14,875
Glory, Lord!

960
01:44:16,216 --> 01:44:22,121
Sister Rosa, let's now allow Jesus
to change your life?

961
01:44:22,289 --> 01:44:26,020
Straighten your legs.
Have faith, sister Rosa.

962
01:44:26,226 --> 01:44:27,955
Come on, sister Rosa.

963
01:44:34,001 --> 01:44:35,263
Steady...

964
01:44:35,435 --> 01:44:40,168
You will leave here walking, Rosa.

965
01:44:41,942 --> 01:44:43,569
Dinho...

966
01:44:58,659 --> 01:45:00,251
God knows
What he does, Rosa.

967
01:45:00,894 --> 01:45:03,089
He knows how to hit us
Where it hurts.

968
01:45:27,821 --> 01:45:31,358
They put all the pressure on us.

969
01:45:31,393 --> 01:45:32,256
Wait a second, wait.

970
01:45:39,533 --> 01:45:42,798
What are you doing there, kid?

971
01:45:42,836 --> 01:45:45,396
- Get out!
- I'm loading the compressor.

972
01:45:50,077 --> 01:45:51,659
What the hell?

973
01:45:51,694 --> 01:45:53,242
Get down, kid!
