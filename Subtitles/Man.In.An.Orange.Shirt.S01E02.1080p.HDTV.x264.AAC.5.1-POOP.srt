Thank you. Bless you, Rita.

Now he's had his boosters,
you can take him to the park

00:01:53,131 --> 00:01:54,521
so he can play with his friends.

19's a good age,

Er, I... Claudie was
my girlfriend at uni.

Yeah, I am.

124
00:10:18,081 --> 00:10:19,317
I turned him.

00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:24,320
I love how relaxed you Brits are.

126
00:10:24,345 --> 00:10:27,645
I was told you'd be all uptight
and judgemental.

127
00:10:35,441 --> 00:10:37,540
And two doubles with an overtrick.

Oh, with all this excitement,
I've just got to pee.

They've been on two dates now!

What, to the theatre?

No, to a hotel.

133

She's on some pills.

134
00:10:58,945 --> 00:11:01,210
It certainly helps her card play.

135

I don't understand.

136
00:11:03,694 --> 00:11:08,010
I was... It was such a relief,
when I could quietly give up.

apologies, this is my round.

He better be worth it. Let me see.

152

Yeah, and his face?

I will give you a full report.

657
00:56:08,510 --> 00:56:10,519
very, very proud of you.

658
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:21,909
Oh, darling.

659
00:56:25,050 --> 00:56:25,989
Thank you.

"My darling Thomas. I'm at work.

00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,888
"Nobody knows I'm writing to you here.

664
00:57:11,930 --> 00:57:13,968
"You refuse my visits,

665
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:16,975
"so you're probably tearing up
my letters, too.

666
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:21,261
"But there's nothing else I can do
but keep trying.

"It's beyond my control, do you see?

668
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:30,475
"All those months ago, when I had
nothing to lose, really,

669
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:31,925
"I wrote to you in my head

670
00:57:31,950 --> 00:57:34,859
"but was too cowardly
to set more than lies on paper.

671
00:57:36,481 --> 00:57:38,680
"And now, I find I no longer care.

672
00:57:41,610 --> 00:57:45,359
"The love I feel for you runs
through me like grain through wood.

"I love you, Thomas.

674
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:56,395
"Your face, your voice, your touch

675
00:57:56,420 --> 00:57:58,998
"enter my mind at the least
opportune moments

676
00:57:59,785 --> 00:58:02,327
"and I find I have no power
to withstand them.

677
00:58:03,310 --> 00:58:04,479
"No desire to.

678

"I want us to be together,
as we were in the cottage.

"Only for ever, not just a weekend.

680
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:21,854
"I want it to go on so long
that it feels normal.

681
00:58:24,030 --> 00:58:25,861
"I think of you constantly.

682
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:28,909
"Your face, your breath
on my neck at night.

"I want to do all the ordinary,

"un-bedroomy things
we never got around to doing.

"Making toast. Raking leaves.

"I see that now.
