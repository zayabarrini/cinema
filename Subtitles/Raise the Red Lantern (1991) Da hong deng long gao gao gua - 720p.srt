1
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:56,052
Mother, stop!

2
00:00:57,261 --> 00:00:59,136
You've been talking for three days.

3
00:01:00,261 --> 00:01:01,636
I've thought it over.

4
00:01:02,677 --> 00:01:04,386
Alright, I'll get married.

5
00:01:04,677 --> 00:01:07,969
Good! To what sort of man?

6
00:01:09,511 --> 00:01:12,927
What sort of man? Is it up to me?

7
00:01:13,636 --> 00:01:18,427
You always speak of money.
Why not marry a rich man?

8
00:01:19,177 --> 00:01:21,844
Marry a rich man and you'll
only be his concubine.

9
00:01:28,386 --> 00:01:31,594
Let me be a concubine.

10
00:01:33,094 --> 00:01:35,386
Isn't that a woman's fate?

11
00:04:11,677 --> 00:04:13,594
Miss, looking for someone?

12
00:04:17,219 --> 00:04:18,469
I'm Songlian.

13
00:04:19,136 --> 00:04:21,094
We met once, remember?

14
00:04:23,011 --> 00:04:26,719
It's our Fourth Mistress! Please wait...

15
00:04:32,636 --> 00:04:34,886
We sent the bridal sedan for you.
Didn't it arrive?

16
00:04:35,719 --> 00:04:37,011
I walked here myself.

17
00:04:47,761 --> 00:04:50,052
- Let me carry it.
- I can manage.

18
00:05:12,261 --> 00:05:14,261
Wait here. I'll go take a look.

19
00:05:34,261 --> 00:05:35,344
Who are you?

20
00:05:39,469 --> 00:05:41,386
Fourth Mistress, please come in.

21
00:05:43,344 --> 00:05:45,052
So the Fourth Mistress is you!

22
00:05:54,094 --> 00:05:57,011
Yes, I'm the Fourth Mistress!

23
00:06:04,177 --> 00:06:05,636
Bring my suitcase inside.

24
00:06:17,594 --> 00:06:20,594
This is where you will live.

25
00:06:20,802 --> 00:06:24,636
My name is Chen Baishun, the housekeeper.
I am at your service.

26
00:06:27,052 --> 00:06:30,177
Why are there so many red lanterns?

27
00:06:31,469 --> 00:06:32,761
Because you're coming!

28
00:08:08,219 --> 00:08:11,469
Fourth Mistress,
this is part of our family custom.

29
00:08:11,802 --> 00:08:13,469
I'm here to serve you.

30
00:10:21,427 --> 00:10:23,469
You'll get used to it.

31
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,802
Fourth Mistress. We're here to do your
hair and help you change.

32
00:11:04,969 --> 00:11:07,552
Master, congratulations on your wedding.

33
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:21,011
How was the foot massage?

34
00:11:24,469 --> 00:11:26,761
A woman's feet are very important.

35
00:11:27,552 --> 00:11:30,511
When they're comfortable,
she is healthier...

36
00:11:31,052 --> 00:11:33,594
...and better able to serve her man.

37
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:38,136
Pick up that lantern.

38
00:11:40,469 --> 00:11:42,261
Yes, that one.

39
00:12:03,469 --> 00:12:04,927
Higher...

40
00:12:10,969 --> 00:12:12,552
Look up.

41
00:12:18,469 --> 00:12:20,844
Educated girls are different.

42
00:12:21,761 --> 00:12:24,094
Now, undress and get in bed.

43
00:13:20,969 --> 00:13:22,344
Put out the lights.

44
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:28,011
What? I have all these lanterns
so I can see.

45
00:13:29,011 --> 00:13:30,802
I like it bright and formal.

46
00:14:02,094 --> 00:14:03,011
Who's there?

47
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:06,469
Third Mistress is sick.
She wants you to come.

48
00:14:06,802 --> 00:14:08,094
I'm in bed.

49
00:14:09,594 --> 00:14:11,136
It's an emergency.

50
00:14:11,302 --> 00:14:12,594
She said you must come.

51
00:14:12,969 --> 00:14:14,261
It can wait till tomorrow.

52
00:14:15,594 --> 00:14:17,761
If something serious happens to her,

53
00:14:17,969 --> 00:14:19,261
we'll be blamed.

54
00:14:19,427 --> 00:14:22,177
Damn it! What is she up to?

55
00:14:27,261 --> 00:14:31,261
I'll have to go see.
Or she won't let me sleep tonight.

56
00:14:35,802 --> 00:14:38,386
The Master is leaving?
Going to the third house?

57
00:14:38,552 --> 00:14:39,344
Yes!

58
00:14:39,886 --> 00:14:43,719
Light the lanterns at the third house!

59
00:16:21,261 --> 00:16:22,427
Fourth Mistress...

60
00:16:25,719 --> 00:16:26,927
Fourth Mistress...

61
00:16:30,552 --> 00:16:33,469
Fourth Mistress. According to our custom,

62
00:16:33,636 --> 00:16:36,969
you should visit the other three mistress.

63
00:16:37,177 --> 00:16:38,677
Take your breakfast later.

64
00:16:58,177 --> 00:17:02,136
It's our custom to have all
meetings and meals here.

65
00:17:02,427 --> 00:17:06,094
The Chen family's customs
go back many generations.

66
00:17:06,427 --> 00:17:11,052
It is important that you obey them.

67
00:17:36,469 --> 00:17:39,094
Kowtow to our ancestors.

68
00:17:47,844 --> 00:17:51,011
First, go to greet the master at
the Third Mistress' house.

69
00:18:00,927 --> 00:18:03,094
It seems they're still asleep.

70
00:18:03,261 --> 00:18:06,052
We'll come back.

71
00:18:23,344 --> 00:18:27,594
First Mistress,
the Fourth Mistress is here to visit.

72
00:18:29,594 --> 00:18:30,386
Big sister.

73
00:18:34,636 --> 00:18:35,802
How old are you?

74
00:18:37,844 --> 00:18:38,844
Nineteen.

75
00:18:40,177 --> 00:18:42,261
I heard you went to university.

76
00:18:44,677 --> 00:18:46,719
For six months.

77
00:18:49,302 --> 00:18:54,427
It's good you're educated.

78
00:18:56,969 --> 00:19:00,761
You'll get used to living here.

79
00:19:01,636 --> 00:19:05,052
Get on well with your sisters.

80
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:07,594
Serve the Master well.

81
00:19:11,677 --> 00:19:12,719
You can go now.

82
00:19:21,677 --> 00:19:24,636
Such sins, such sins...

83
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:34,302
What is she, about 100 years old? Ancient!

84
00:19:42,802 --> 00:19:46,344
Second Mistress,
the Fourth Mistress has come to visit.

85
00:19:51,094 --> 00:19:54,052
Fourth sister is here. Come in!

86
00:19:54,261 --> 00:19:54,969
Second sister.

87
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:57,177
Do come in.

88
00:20:02,511 --> 00:20:05,594
What a pretty face! What is your name?

89
00:20:05,969 --> 00:20:06,969
Songlian.

90
00:20:08,052 --> 00:20:10,094
A pretty name, too.

91
00:20:10,927 --> 00:20:14,094
I'm Zhouyun. Just call me by my name.

92
00:20:15,802 --> 00:20:18,136
You look like a student.

93
00:20:18,344 --> 00:20:20,052
I was at university for six months.

94
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:21,927
Why did you leave?

95
00:20:23,802 --> 00:20:27,552
My father died.
The family couldn't afford it.

96
00:20:28,969 --> 00:20:30,552
How old was your father?

97
00:20:31,052 --> 00:20:32,177
Fifty-three.

98
00:20:32,844 --> 00:20:34,511
So young!

99
00:20:38,719 --> 00:20:40,719
Life is so unpredictable.

100
00:20:42,636 --> 00:20:44,136
Tea, Fourth Mistress.

101
00:20:46,386 --> 00:20:47,594
Fourth sister, please have some tea.

102
00:20:52,636 --> 00:20:53,677
Where are you from?

103
00:20:54,261 --> 00:20:55,094
Fengcheng.

104
00:20:56,302 --> 00:20:58,052
They grow tea there.

105
00:20:58,469 --> 00:21:01,052
My father was in the tea business.

106
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,261
His shop closed down.

107
00:21:06,386 --> 00:21:10,302
Your mother let you marry someone
from so far away?

108
00:21:12,927 --> 00:21:13,969
She's my stepmother.

109
00:21:17,136 --> 00:21:18,261
I see.

110
00:21:21,136 --> 00:21:25,427
So, how was the foot massage last night?

111
00:21:26,552 --> 00:21:29,094
Is it like that every night?

112
00:21:30,136 --> 00:21:31,261
Silly.

113
00:21:31,844 --> 00:21:34,427
You can't have it whenever you wish.

114
00:21:35,011 --> 00:21:36,511
Where the master spends the night...

115
00:21:36,844 --> 00:21:38,761
...that mistress gets a foot massage
and lighted lanterns.

116
00:21:40,427 --> 00:21:44,427
With a new wife as young
and pretty as you...

117
00:21:44,844 --> 00:21:49,052
...I'm afraid I won't be enjoying
these privileges for some time.

118
00:21:52,802 --> 00:21:54,386
But don't underestimate the
importance of this custom.

119
00:21:55,261 --> 00:21:57,427
If you can manage to have a
foot massage everyday...

120
00:21:57,719 --> 00:22:01,969
...you'll soon be running this household.

121
00:22:04,886 --> 00:22:08,427
Yizhen, come meet your Fourth Aunt.

122
00:22:09,177 --> 00:22:10,052
Fourth Aunt!

123
00:22:11,427 --> 00:22:14,594
How useless! I only have a daughter.

124
00:22:14,802 --> 00:22:17,094
It's getting late.

125
00:22:17,219 --> 00:22:19,344
We must visit the Third Mistress.

126
00:22:19,594 --> 00:22:21,844
Sorry, I just keep talking.

127
00:22:22,302 --> 00:22:24,177
Of course you must meet
the Third Mistress.

128
00:22:24,344 --> 00:22:26,594
She was a famous opera singer.

129
00:22:27,136 --> 00:22:29,261
She sings well and is pretty too.

130
00:22:29,802 --> 00:22:32,469
But she can be so difficult.

131
00:22:33,886 --> 00:22:35,969
Asking for the Master on...

132
00:22:36,427 --> 00:22:38,636
...your wedding night!

133
00:22:39,219 --> 00:22:40,719
So impolite to you!

134
00:22:41,344 --> 00:22:42,677
Wasn't she sick?

135
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:47,094
Sick? She's just spoiled!

136
00:23:16,136 --> 00:23:17,219
Has the Master left?

137
00:23:17,344 --> 00:23:20,302
Just now.
They're putting out the lanterns.

138
00:23:20,761 --> 00:23:23,511
Let's meet the Third Mistress.

139
00:23:24,302 --> 00:23:27,594
Third Mistress says
she isn't feeling well...

140
00:23:27,927 --> 00:23:29,386
...and says she'll meet you another day.

141
00:23:36,886 --> 00:23:40,636
Third Mistress' son, Feilan.

142
00:23:40,802 --> 00:23:43,302
Same age as Miss Yizhen.

143
00:23:43,802 --> 00:23:45,969
Come meet your Fourth Aunt.

144
00:23:46,302 --> 00:23:47,261
Fourth Aunt!

145
00:23:53,469 --> 00:23:54,677
Fourth Mistress...

146
00:23:59,136 --> 00:23:59,927
Fourth Mistress...

147
00:24:00,344 --> 00:24:01,344
...this is Yan'er.

148
00:24:01,886 --> 00:24:07,802
Master says she'll be your maid.

149
00:24:08,136 --> 00:24:10,594
Yan'er, come greet the Fourth Mistress.

150
00:24:11,969 --> 00:24:12,969
Fourth Mistress.

151
00:24:13,386 --> 00:24:17,552
I've seen her before.
Bad tempered, isn't she?

152
00:24:17,636 --> 00:24:19,927
No, she's a good girl.
Quick and hardworking too.

153
00:24:20,136 --> 00:24:22,177
Been here for several years.

154
00:24:22,886 --> 00:24:26,469
No lice in her hair, are there?
I hate lice.

155
00:24:27,344 --> 00:24:30,011
Let the Fourth mistress take a look.

156
00:24:38,261 --> 00:24:41,136
Kneel down. Let's look at your hair.

157
00:24:46,177 --> 00:24:48,969
What is that smell? Go wash your hair!

158
00:24:52,469 --> 00:24:54,136
Didn't you hear?

159
00:24:55,302 --> 00:24:56,927
I only washed it yesterday.

160
00:24:57,469 --> 00:25:00,302
And wash the clothes I just took
off while you're at it.

161
00:25:01,636 --> 00:25:03,136
Go, quickly!

162
00:25:03,302 --> 00:25:06,094
Or the Fourth Mistress will be angry. Go!

163
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:13,302
Yan'er!

164
00:25:14,011 --> 00:25:16,094
Yan'er!

165
00:25:18,969 --> 00:25:20,511
Why haven't you washed your hair?

166
00:25:21,927 --> 00:25:26,886
The Master favours you and you
thought he'd choose you as a wife.

167
00:25:28,094 --> 00:25:31,719
You as our Fourth Mistress?

168
00:25:31,844 --> 00:25:33,802
You were born to be a servant.

169
00:25:34,302 --> 00:25:36,261
Serve the Fourth Mistress well!

170
00:25:37,344 --> 00:25:38,594
Don't waste your time dreaming!

171
00:25:42,594 --> 00:25:44,052
And don't forget to wash your hair!

172
00:26:00,261 --> 00:26:01,886
Where is Meishan?

173
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:05,511
The Third Mistress is coming.

174
00:26:05,802 --> 00:26:08,552
Doctor Gao is writing her a prescription.

175
00:26:17,011 --> 00:26:18,219
Here comes third sister.

176
00:26:19,136 --> 00:26:21,719
Third sister, this is our fourth sister.

177
00:26:23,302 --> 00:26:25,219
You haven't met, have you?

178
00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:29,177
Third sister!

179
00:26:37,344 --> 00:26:41,177
Songlian is new here.
Take good care of her.

180
00:26:41,302 --> 00:26:44,344
From now on, you sisters must
get on well with each other.

181
00:26:44,677 --> 00:26:45,886
Let's eat.

182
00:26:57,761 --> 00:26:59,594
Why aren't you eating?

183
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:01,802
I don't like meat.

184
00:27:04,302 --> 00:27:05,927
What vegetable dishes do we have today?

185
00:27:06,136 --> 00:27:08,552
Master, today we have...

186
00:27:10,802 --> 00:27:14,094
...fragrant mushrooms, chrysanthemum
moss hair, bird's nest...

187
00:27:14,302 --> 00:27:17,761
...thrice-fried mushroom,
five-color vegetables...

188
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:22,719
...vegetarian hot-pot and
also heart of cactus.

189
00:27:26,969 --> 00:27:28,761
According to custom...

190
00:27:28,927 --> 00:27:30,594
...the one with lighted lanterns
can have whatever she likes.

191
00:27:31,094 --> 00:27:32,886
What would you like?

192
00:27:35,594 --> 00:27:37,427
I want spinach and beancurd.

193
00:27:38,469 --> 00:27:41,011
Bring some spinach and beancurd.

194
00:27:42,011 --> 00:27:45,136
Also some young bean sprouts.

195
00:27:47,302 --> 00:27:48,261
Fourth Mistress...

196
00:27:53,844 --> 00:27:59,594
Master asks you to wait at
the door for instructions.

197
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:03,094
What instructions?

198
00:28:03,261 --> 00:28:05,636
Please wait outside.

199
00:28:05,802 --> 00:28:08,302
The Master may have instructions
before he retires.

200
00:28:09,261 --> 00:28:13,511
But why do we have to wait outside?

201
00:28:13,802 --> 00:28:16,177
It's another old family custom.

202
00:28:16,433 --> 00:28:17,808
All the other mistresses ago.

203
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:32,516
But I wasn't called before.

204
00:28:32,891 --> 00:28:35,058
Not for nine days after the wedding.

205
00:28:35,308 --> 00:28:38,016
This is your 10th day.

206
00:29:42,891 --> 00:29:45,683
Light the lanterns at the fourth house!

207
00:30:36,433 --> 00:30:37,183
Well?

208
00:30:37,558 --> 00:30:42,183
Lighted lanterns, foot massages.
Do you like it here?

209
00:30:44,683 --> 00:30:47,891
After a few days, you won't want to leave.

210
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:53,933
Who is it?

211
00:30:54,475 --> 00:30:57,933
Third Mistress says she's sick again.

212
00:30:58,183 --> 00:30:59,850
She wants the master to come over.

213
00:31:00,308 --> 00:31:03,350
Third sister is asking for you again.
You must go.

214
00:31:03,641 --> 00:31:07,808
Meishan is so impossible!

215
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:12,016
Go, don't come to me again.

216
00:31:12,225 --> 00:31:14,558
You don't mean that.

217
00:31:16,141 --> 00:31:18,975
Tell the Third Mistress
I won't see her tonight!

218
00:31:20,391 --> 00:31:22,725
What am I to tell her?

219
00:31:22,891 --> 00:31:24,766
Nonsense! What do you mean?

220
00:31:25,058 --> 00:31:28,016
Tell her I'll see her tomorrow!

221
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:43,600
- Who's singing? Third sister?
- Yes.

222
00:31:45,766 --> 00:31:48,350
She was sick last night...

223
00:31:49,683 --> 00:31:53,266
...but she's singing at this hour.

224
00:31:54,516 --> 00:31:56,016
She won't let us sleep.

225
00:31:57,475 --> 00:32:02,016
She sings when she's happy,
cries when she's mad.

226
00:32:02,725 --> 00:32:05,850
That bitch! Never mind her!

227
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:59,683
Third sister, have you recovered?

228
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:05,183
Did I wake you from your sweet dreams?

229
00:35:05,558 --> 00:35:08,350
Yes, you did.

230
00:35:09,433 --> 00:35:13,808
Good, or you'll sleep till you're silly.

231
00:35:15,058 --> 00:35:19,850
Silly, hardly!
I came up to hear third sister sing.

232
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,183
Do continue.

233
00:35:23,391 --> 00:35:24,475
You want to listen...

234
00:35:25,183 --> 00:35:26,850
...but I don't feel like singing anymore.

235
00:36:02,891 --> 00:36:04,683
You went to hear Meishan sing?

236
00:36:10,558 --> 00:36:13,850
I've spoiled her.

237
00:36:14,433 --> 00:36:18,183
When she's angry,
she even curses my ancestors.

238
00:36:18,391 --> 00:36:20,016
Bitch!

239
00:36:20,475 --> 00:36:22,350
I must teach her a lesson.

240
00:36:32,058 --> 00:36:34,683
What? Angry?

241
00:36:39,058 --> 00:36:42,308
Don't be childish.

242
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:46,558
I'll take you to Wumei Lane
today to eat dumplings.

243
00:36:47,391 --> 00:36:49,516
Didn't you say you liked
the dumplings there?

244
00:36:57,391 --> 00:36:59,058
You really don't want me to stay?

245
00:37:00,225 --> 00:37:04,516
There are others desperate for
a foot massage, you know.

246
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:13,850
The Master has left!
Blow out the lanterns!

247
00:37:34,308 --> 00:37:38,183
Light the lanterns at the third house!

248
00:38:02,683 --> 00:38:03,433
Yan'er!

249
00:38:06,975 --> 00:38:10,100
Yan'er! Yan'er!

250
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:11,683
Coming!

251
00:38:21,766 --> 00:38:24,225
Can't you walk faster?

252
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,433
Go away if you don't like working for me.

253
00:38:53,725 --> 00:38:56,475
Don't think because the mater touched you,
you can behave this way.

254
00:38:58,725 --> 00:39:00,808
Always pulling a long face!

255
00:39:04,266 --> 00:39:07,850
No, I wouldn't dare.

256
00:39:08,933 --> 00:39:10,433
But any face is better than having none!

257
00:39:16,266 --> 00:39:19,725
Why did you come to me?

258
00:39:20,891 --> 00:39:22,933
Tired of your new wife already?

259
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,850
What's so good about my place?

260
00:39:28,433 --> 00:39:30,225
She's mad at me.

261
00:39:30,558 --> 00:39:32,058
Of course it's good here.

262
00:39:33,391 --> 00:39:36,850
You are gentle and you'll sing for me.

263
00:39:49,058 --> 00:39:49,891
Well done!

264
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:11,558
Well done!

265
00:40:11,766 --> 00:40:13,308
The more you sing,
the better it gets. Again!

266
00:41:14,975 --> 00:41:15,975
Fourth sister!

267
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:20,808
Fourth sister, come down here!

268
00:41:21,225 --> 00:41:24,350
I've something to say to you.

269
00:41:26,475 --> 00:41:27,600
Fourth sister.

270
00:41:30,433 --> 00:41:32,058
Why wandering alone?

271
00:41:32,391 --> 00:41:33,183
Come down.

272
00:41:34,558 --> 00:41:35,850
I'm looking for you.

273
00:41:37,391 --> 00:41:38,183
Second sister.

274
00:41:40,308 --> 00:41:42,641
You don't look well.

275
00:41:44,808 --> 00:41:46,183
No more lighted lanterns
and foot massages...

276
00:41:46,433 --> 00:41:47,808
...are you unhappy?

277
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:54,225
I don't care. I like being alone.

278
00:41:55,225 --> 00:41:58,433
You don't want to be alone in this family.

279
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:01,683
No foot massages for a few days...

280
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,100
...and the servants don't
treat you the same way.

281
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,100
The master can come and go as he pleases.

282
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,725
Doesn't he find these custom troublesome?

283
00:42:12,641 --> 00:42:16,225
Lighting lanterns is an old family custom.

284
00:42:17,391 --> 00:42:19,433
It was like this when I arrived.

285
00:42:20,725 --> 00:42:24,766
This is silk from Suzhou.
Have some dresses made with it.

286
00:42:25,058 --> 00:42:29,350
I'm embarrassed.

287
00:42:29,641 --> 00:42:30,850
I should be giving you gifts.

288
00:42:31,058 --> 00:42:32,516
Why?

289
00:42:33,391 --> 00:42:37,725
I thought of this silk
when I first saw you.

290
00:42:39,808 --> 00:42:42,183
I wouldn't give it to that singer...

291
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:44,016
...even if she paid for it.

292
00:42:47,933 --> 00:42:50,266
Did you see how self-satisfied
she was just now?

293
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:55,600
What is that small room for up above?

294
00:42:55,766 --> 00:42:57,266
It's locked with a big chain.

295
00:42:57,933 --> 00:42:59,350
That house of death?

296
00:43:00,016 --> 00:43:03,308
Don't go there.
Several people have died there.

297
00:43:03,725 --> 00:43:07,683
What people?

298
00:43:09,141 --> 00:43:13,558
Women from past generations.
They hanged there.

299
00:43:15,891 --> 00:43:20,225
Don't ask about this.
Nobody here wants to talk about it.

300
00:43:23,558 --> 00:43:28,600
Visit me when you have time.
Don't go there again.

301
00:43:32,266 --> 00:43:33,683
The Master's out.

302
00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:35,975
He said you shouldn't wait for him.

303
00:43:41,891 --> 00:43:42,683
Let's eat then.

304
00:43:55,725 --> 00:43:57,516
Why is there no spinach and beancurd?

305
00:44:01,308 --> 00:44:04,266
There are too many vegetable
dishes already.

306
00:44:05,558 --> 00:44:09,725
Go, bring some pork steamed
in lotus leaves.

307
00:44:09,891 --> 00:44:10,808
Yes.

308
00:44:24,725 --> 00:44:26,683
Why so many meat dishes today?

309
00:44:27,308 --> 00:44:29,641
The third house had lighted
lanterns yesterday.

310
00:44:31,683 --> 00:44:33,558
Didn't the master remarry recently?

311
00:44:34,225 --> 00:44:36,850
Who knows about these things?

312
00:44:37,308 --> 00:44:38,975
It's up to him.

313
00:44:39,225 --> 00:44:42,766
The house with lighted lanterns
sets the menu.

314
00:44:42,933 --> 00:44:44,100
We just follow orders.

315
00:46:00,016 --> 00:46:00,808
Who is it?

316
00:46:01,058 --> 00:46:02,766
Yan'er.

317
00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:05,725
Why are you sneaking around like that?

318
00:46:06,766 --> 00:46:08,850
Third Mistress asks you
over to play majong.

319
00:46:10,058 --> 00:46:13,225
Me, play majong? What an idea!

320
00:46:15,641 --> 00:46:16,350
I won't go.

321
00:46:18,725 --> 00:46:19,725
Fourth sister...

322
00:46:20,850 --> 00:46:21,766
Fourth sister...

323
00:46:25,225 --> 00:46:28,433
...we need one more player. Come!

324
00:46:31,725 --> 00:46:33,183
I don't like majong.

325
00:46:36,516 --> 00:46:40,433
Come on. Don't stay in your house all day.

326
00:46:46,683 --> 00:46:49,766
Still angry about the spinach
and beancurd?

327
00:46:50,558 --> 00:46:51,808
I couldn't care less.

328
00:46:52,725 --> 00:46:56,850
Good. I knew fourth sister wasn't petty.

329
00:46:57,183 --> 00:47:00,225
Don't like losing your money to me too?

330
00:47:01,391 --> 00:47:04,433
Don't worry. I'll let you win.

331
00:47:07,891 --> 00:47:12,433
Since you put it that way, then I must go.

332
00:47:14,016 --> 00:47:15,433
But no need to let me win.

333
00:47:15,725 --> 00:47:18,558
Who knows how the game will end?

334
00:47:18,766 --> 00:47:19,850
Good!

335
00:47:24,516 --> 00:47:26,225
This is Doctor Gao, a regular visitor.

336
00:47:26,391 --> 00:47:28,100
He is our family doctor.

337
00:47:28,225 --> 00:47:29,766
His friend, Mr. Wang.

338
00:47:29,891 --> 00:47:32,308
This is our Fourth Mistress.

339
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:34,350
Please sit down.

340
00:47:36,058 --> 00:47:36,850
Let's start.

341
00:47:39,308 --> 00:47:42,433
Our Fourth Mistress was a
university student.

342
00:47:42,850 --> 00:47:44,475
I'm only an opera singer.

343
00:47:47,350 --> 00:47:49,641
She plays to win today.

344
00:47:50,225 --> 00:47:52,016
Both of you should be careful.

345
00:47:52,641 --> 00:47:54,641
Come, it's just a game.

346
00:47:58,558 --> 00:48:03,100
Third sister's house is
decorated like a stage.

347
00:48:03,683 --> 00:48:06,350
No one can forget their past.

348
00:48:11,225 --> 00:48:12,350
The Master's back.

349
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:14,391
Why wasn't it announced?

350
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:17,058
I just came in.

351
00:48:17,225 --> 00:48:18,058
The Master must be tired.

352
00:48:18,641 --> 00:48:19,516
Where is she?

353
00:48:19,850 --> 00:48:22,391
Playing majong with the Third Mistress.

354
00:48:22,558 --> 00:48:23,266
I'll call her.

355
00:48:23,391 --> 00:48:24,308
Never mind.

356
00:48:26,225 --> 00:48:29,016
Why can't she stay in her own house?

357
00:48:29,725 --> 00:48:31,058
Light the lanterns at the second house.

358
00:48:56,225 --> 00:48:58,641
The master's back. He couldn't find you...

359
00:48:58,725 --> 00:49:00,766
...and went to the second house.

360
00:49:09,058 --> 00:49:12,891
Nevermind. Let's play.

361
00:49:19,808 --> 00:49:24,350
Fourth sister has done Zhuoyun a favour.

362
00:49:24,683 --> 00:49:26,933
She is so lonely.

363
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:29,766
Lend her the master for one night.

364
00:49:30,016 --> 00:49:31,558
If you lose money, have her pay you back.

365
00:49:31,891 --> 00:49:32,766
Then you're even.

366
00:49:40,516 --> 00:49:44,975
I heard the Fourth Mistress
didn't finish university. Why?

367
00:49:45,725 --> 00:49:47,225
What's the use?

368
00:49:47,891 --> 00:49:49,975
I'm just one of the Master's robes.

369
00:49:50,558 --> 00:49:52,600
He can wear it or he can take it off.

370
00:50:11,475 --> 00:50:16,558
Master, I want to give you a son.

371
00:50:54,808 --> 00:51:00,933
Meishan was famous for singing this opera.

372
00:51:05,850 --> 00:51:07,516
That was years ago.

373
00:52:12,266 --> 00:52:14,683
This place must be haunted.

374
00:52:14,891 --> 00:52:17,641
Haunted? Nonsense!

375
00:52:19,850 --> 00:52:21,725
That room on the roof.

376
00:52:21,975 --> 00:52:28,016
Two people hanged there, that's all.

377
00:52:28,850 --> 00:52:30,100
Why?

378
00:52:30,308 --> 00:52:35,641
Need you ask?
They were having illicit affairs.

379
00:52:36,683 --> 00:52:37,933
Who were they?

380
00:52:39,350 --> 00:52:44,391
Nobody you know.
Two women from past generations.

381
00:52:47,225 --> 00:52:48,641
Concubines?

382
00:52:52,308 --> 00:52:53,683
Don't talk nonsense!

383
00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:10,308
What is it now?

384
00:53:11,891 --> 00:53:12,891
She's peeping at us.

385
00:53:13,391 --> 00:53:15,141
- Who?
- Yan'er.

386
00:53:16,683 --> 00:53:20,808
What's there to look at.
She can't see anything anyway.

387
00:53:21,433 --> 00:53:22,641
You're always on her side.

388
00:53:24,558 --> 00:53:28,350
I can smell her miles away.

389
00:53:38,641 --> 00:53:40,433
- Who is it?
- Master.

390
00:53:43,766 --> 00:53:44,808
What is it?

391
00:53:44,933 --> 00:53:50,766
The Fourth Mistress'
spinach and beancurd is ready.

392
00:53:50,891 --> 00:53:53,766
The other mistresses are waiting.

393
00:53:54,391 --> 00:53:58,433
I'm not going. Ask them to bring it here.

394
00:54:02,016 --> 00:54:03,433
That's not right.

395
00:54:04,475 --> 00:54:08,183
We should go or they'll talk.

396
00:54:08,558 --> 00:54:09,516
Them!

397
00:54:10,016 --> 00:54:13,516
What do I care if they talk!

398
00:54:14,433 --> 00:54:17,183
Alright, we'll eat here.

399
00:54:18,016 --> 00:54:21,891
Go, tell them to bring the food here.

400
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:31,141
The Master asks that you go ahead.

401
00:54:31,225 --> 00:54:32,891
He isn't coming.

402
00:54:33,016 --> 00:54:35,100
The food will be taken to
the Fourth Mistress' room.

403
00:54:43,183 --> 00:54:46,016
We don't have this custom here.

404
00:54:48,683 --> 00:54:50,725
Is this not the Fourth Mistress' idea?

405
00:55:02,308 --> 00:55:07,516
Third sister, don't be angry. Let's eat.

406
00:55:10,933 --> 00:55:15,891
Big sister, let me make this clear.

407
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:19,141
If my lanterns are lit,

408
00:55:19,475 --> 00:55:21,183
I want my food brought to me too.

409
00:55:22,391 --> 00:55:26,266
You want to be as foolish?

410
00:55:28,266 --> 00:55:30,100
How does that make our Big sister feel?

411
00:55:30,725 --> 00:55:34,766
What do I matter? I'm just an old woman.

412
00:55:35,808 --> 00:55:39,183
One of these days,
this family will perish in your hands.

413
00:55:50,433 --> 00:55:51,850
Who is playing the flute?

414
00:55:52,183 --> 00:55:54,975
Our young master.
He came back this morning.

415
00:55:55,225 --> 00:55:57,558
Feipu, son of the First Mistress?

416
00:55:57,725 --> 00:55:59,350
I heard he's always away.

417
00:55:59,558 --> 00:56:01,266
He's very busy.

418
00:56:01,391 --> 00:56:04,350
He's going Yunnan in the morning.

419
00:56:59,641 --> 00:57:00,850
Are you Songlian?

420
00:57:05,350 --> 00:57:08,475
You shouldn't call me by my name.

421
00:57:08,850 --> 00:57:11,933
How should I address you? Fourth Mistress?

422
00:57:18,225 --> 00:57:20,141
Did the music bring you here?

423
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:24,850
Go on, don't let me stop you.

424
00:57:26,016 --> 00:57:27,058
Can you play too?

425
00:57:29,891 --> 00:57:33,308
Feipu, come down here.

426
00:57:37,391 --> 00:57:40,891
My mother wants me. I must go.

427
00:58:22,391 --> 00:58:23,350
Yan'er!

428
00:58:24,933 --> 00:58:26,141
Yan'er!

429
00:58:27,016 --> 00:58:28,016
Come here.

430
00:58:32,308 --> 00:58:34,058
Did you open my suitcase?

431
00:58:34,850 --> 00:58:38,808
Yes, to tidy up your clothes.

432
00:58:39,266 --> 00:58:41,308
Did you see a flute inside?

433
00:58:41,808 --> 00:58:46,475
Flute? No. Only men play the flute.

434
00:58:50,808 --> 00:58:52,183
You stole it.

435
00:58:52,516 --> 00:58:57,516
Fourth Mistress.
Why would I want to steal it?

436
00:58:58,016 --> 00:59:00,975
You're always sneaking about.
Stop pretending.

437
00:59:01,391 --> 00:59:04,016
Don't blame it on me.

438
00:59:04,350 --> 00:59:06,975
Ask the other mistress.

439
00:59:07,183 --> 00:59:09,475
Have I ever stolen anything?

440
00:59:16,725 --> 00:59:20,016
Fourth Mistress,
I really didn't take your flute!

441
00:59:20,558 --> 00:59:21,766
I didn't!

442
00:59:23,308 --> 00:59:26,350
Fourth Mistress, I didn't!

443
00:59:27,558 --> 00:59:30,850
I didn't take it!

444
00:59:33,657 --> 00:59:37,074
Don't go in! I didn't take your flute!

445
00:59:37,199 --> 00:59:39,240
Then what are you afraid of?

446
00:59:39,407 --> 00:59:40,407
I must take a look!

447
00:59:48,532 --> 00:59:52,324
How dare you light lanterns here!

448
00:59:53,574 --> 00:59:55,657
You're only a servant!

449
00:59:56,782 --> 00:59:58,615
Don't you know the rules here?

450
00:59:59,365 --> 01:00:00,615
Do you know what could happen to you?

451
01:00:01,199 --> 01:00:05,615
I beg you. Don't tell anyone.

452
01:00:06,699 --> 01:00:09,740
Alright, then give me back my flute.

453
01:00:10,032 --> 01:00:14,365
I really didn't take you flute.

454
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:20,907
Fourth Mistress...

455
01:00:39,907 --> 01:00:43,990
"Songlian."

456
01:00:48,949 --> 01:00:53,157
You've put a curse on me!

457
01:00:53,449 --> 01:00:58,407
You want me to die!

458
01:01:46,615 --> 01:01:49,532
Don't cry.

459
01:01:52,032 --> 01:01:53,449
I shouldn't treat you this way.

460
01:01:54,449 --> 01:01:58,240
I'll forget what you did.

461
01:02:04,324 --> 01:02:10,365
You can't read or write.

462
01:02:11,824 --> 01:02:16,449
Tell me, who wrote my name for you?

463
01:02:18,657 --> 01:02:21,740
I can't tell you.

464
01:02:24,824 --> 01:02:29,032
Don't be afraid. Tell me who wrote it.

465
01:02:29,449 --> 01:02:32,407
I'll keep your secret about the lanterns.

466
01:02:37,949 --> 01:02:39,407
Is it the First Mistress?

467
01:02:46,324 --> 01:02:49,115
Then it must be the Third Mistress.

468
01:02:56,074 --> 01:02:57,824
The Second Mistress? Zhuoyun?

469
01:03:02,532 --> 01:03:03,907
Zhuoyun?

470
01:03:12,907 --> 01:03:14,615
Zhuoyun.

471
01:03:25,865 --> 01:03:28,657
Who are you mad at now?

472
01:03:38,740 --> 01:03:41,074
Where did you put my flute?

473
01:03:43,115 --> 01:03:45,907
I didn't want it to distract you.
I took it away.

474
01:03:49,990 --> 01:03:53,240
Who gave it to you?

475
01:03:55,449 --> 01:03:57,074
It belonged to my father.

476
01:04:05,199 --> 01:04:06,449
Sorry for being suspicious.

477
01:04:07,074 --> 01:04:10,407
I thought it was one of the boys
at university.

478
01:04:13,574 --> 01:04:16,074
Where is it? Give it back.

479
01:04:19,490 --> 01:04:24,074
I had it burnt.

480
01:04:25,490 --> 01:04:26,699
Burnt?

481
01:04:45,407 --> 01:04:49,282
It's only a flute.

482
01:04:49,574 --> 01:04:52,574
I'll tell them to buy
you several good ones.

483
01:04:58,615 --> 01:05:00,782
I hate nothing more than people
throwing tantrums.

484
01:05:03,490 --> 01:05:05,032
Why not go to Zhuoyun?

485
01:05:05,907 --> 01:05:07,824
She always has a smile on.

486
01:05:09,074 --> 01:05:10,115
I'm going!

487
01:05:14,199 --> 01:05:17,365
Light the lanterns at the second house!

488
01:05:31,615 --> 01:05:32,657
Fourth sister!

489
01:05:37,282 --> 01:05:41,449
Yan'er said you weren't well.

490
01:05:49,532 --> 01:05:53,990
Are you really sick, or just angry?

491
01:05:55,782 --> 01:05:57,032
What brought you here?

492
01:05:57,449 --> 01:05:58,865
Get up and give me a haircut.

493
01:05:59,574 --> 01:06:03,324
Haircut? I don't know how.

494
01:06:04,032 --> 01:06:05,949
Ask the other sisters.

495
01:06:06,657 --> 01:06:07,990
How can they?

496
01:06:08,324 --> 01:06:10,240
You're better. You went to university.

497
01:06:10,907 --> 01:06:12,115
I want you to cut my hair.

498
01:06:13,449 --> 01:06:19,574
Get up! Come!

499
01:06:28,990 --> 01:06:32,282
Why do you suddenly want a haircut?

500
01:06:34,365 --> 01:06:37,157
Didn't the Master spend the night
with me last night?

501
01:06:38,615 --> 01:06:40,365
I told him I was getting old.

502
01:06:41,199 --> 01:06:42,657
Guess what he said?

503
01:06:44,574 --> 01:06:47,449
He said I'd look younger with short hair.

504
01:06:48,740 --> 01:06:50,740
Since he said that,

505
01:06:50,990 --> 01:06:52,282
I must cut my hair.

506
01:06:55,324 --> 01:06:58,990
Go ahead, cut!

507
01:07:00,282 --> 01:07:01,740
I've never done this before.
You may get hurt.

508
01:07:01,949 --> 01:07:03,865
Don't worry. Go ahead.

509
01:07:05,949 --> 01:07:07,282
Alright...

510
01:07:40,074 --> 01:07:42,282
My ear!

511
01:07:43,990 --> 01:07:46,282
My ear!

512
01:07:47,657 --> 01:07:50,240
My ear!

513
01:07:52,865 --> 01:07:55,074
What happened, Second Mistress?

514
01:07:55,782 --> 01:07:57,865
My ear!

515
01:07:59,365 --> 01:08:01,907
My ear!

516
01:08:20,032 --> 01:08:21,240
Go away!

517
01:08:21,324 --> 01:08:24,407
What are you looking at? Fetch a doctor!

518
01:08:40,490 --> 01:08:42,907
Third sister, what's so funny?

519
01:08:44,115 --> 01:08:47,824
If I hated someone,
I'd cut her ear off too.

520
01:08:48,032 --> 01:08:50,449
I'd cut all of it off.

521
01:08:51,115 --> 01:08:54,657
You think I did it deliberately?

522
01:08:55,824 --> 01:08:57,490
Who knows?

523
01:09:20,949 --> 01:09:24,490
Zhuoyun has a Buddha's face
and a scorpion's heart.

524
01:09:25,199 --> 01:09:26,949
She's the true wicked one.

525
01:09:29,532 --> 01:09:31,074
You think I'm against you.

526
01:09:31,824 --> 01:09:33,699
She's the one I hate most.

527
01:09:36,865 --> 01:09:39,990
I'm no match for her.

528
01:09:41,407 --> 01:09:43,490
Perhaps you can do better.

529
01:09:43,782 --> 01:09:47,532
I thought so when I first saw you.

530
01:09:49,990 --> 01:09:52,157
Do you know about our giving birth?

531
01:09:54,282 --> 01:09:58,324
We both became pregnant
about the same time.

532
01:10:00,740 --> 01:10:02,407
When I was three months along...

533
01:10:04,407 --> 01:10:10,824
...she slepped some medicine into my food.

534
01:10:13,949 --> 01:10:18,824
I was lucky and didn't have a miscarriage.

535
01:10:21,657 --> 01:10:25,115
When we were due,

536
01:10:25,990 --> 01:10:27,824
she wanted to have her baby first...

537
01:10:30,699 --> 01:10:35,074
...and ordered expensive injections
to speed up the delivery.

538
01:10:36,449 --> 01:10:38,490
She was in great pain.

539
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:45,074
In the end, I was lucky...

540
01:10:45,865 --> 01:10:49,365
...and had my boy, Feilan.

541
01:10:51,907 --> 01:10:56,324
She only had a cheap little girl...

542
01:10:57,490 --> 01:11:00,240
...born three hours after my son.

543
01:11:02,699 --> 01:11:09,449
You're new here and the Master
isn't tired of you yet.

544
01:11:09,990 --> 01:11:13,949
But if you don't give him a son...

545
01:11:15,407 --> 01:11:17,782
...there will be hard times ahead.

546
01:11:20,699 --> 01:11:25,157
You may be a student and
I'm only an opera singer.

547
01:11:25,449 --> 01:11:29,657
But our fate is the same.

548
01:11:35,490 --> 01:11:36,990
What happened?

549
01:11:43,990 --> 01:11:50,115
The Master spent only one night with me...

550
01:11:50,282 --> 01:11:53,115
...and fourth sister already
hates me so much.

551
01:11:54,990 --> 01:11:56,865
She almost killed me.

552
01:12:01,532 --> 01:12:08,699
Doctor Gao said the scissors
just missed my artery.

553
01:12:09,657 --> 01:12:11,282
That serious?

554
01:12:16,157 --> 01:12:20,782
It's your fault.
You said I'd look younger with a haircut.

555
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:26,199
That gave her the idea.

556
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:31,657
You sisters shouldn't be like this.

557
01:12:31,990 --> 01:12:37,865
Alright.
I'll stay with you for a few nights.

558
01:12:40,324 --> 01:12:43,449
Light the lanterns at the second house!

559
01:12:53,324 --> 01:12:56,032
The Fourth Mistress is here.

560
01:12:57,074 --> 01:12:58,532
Fourth sister, you've come.

561
01:12:59,324 --> 01:13:00,115
Second sister!

562
01:13:00,324 --> 01:13:01,240
Do sit down.

563
01:13:02,907 --> 01:13:04,115
How are you doing?

564
01:13:04,490 --> 01:13:07,532
Doctor Gao said it wasn't serious.

565
01:13:09,324 --> 01:13:12,282
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean it to happen.

566
01:13:12,699 --> 01:13:16,657
Who said you did?

567
01:13:17,615 --> 01:13:19,740
We sisters are friends.

568
01:13:20,115 --> 01:13:21,990
Don't think about it.

569
01:13:23,449 --> 01:13:26,199
It's funny. I should thank you.

570
01:13:26,657 --> 01:13:29,657
If not for you...

571
01:13:29,907 --> 01:13:32,532
...the Master wouldn't have
stayed with me.

572
01:13:34,949 --> 01:13:36,324
Softer, Aunt Cao.

573
01:13:38,490 --> 01:13:40,990
If you're alright, I'll be going.

574
01:13:41,199 --> 01:13:43,282
I won't see you to the door.

575
01:14:11,324 --> 01:14:12,407
Yan'er!

576
01:14:18,574 --> 01:14:19,615
Yan'er!

577
01:14:26,782 --> 01:14:28,157
What is it, Fourth Mistress?

578
01:14:29,115 --> 01:14:30,407
Where were you?

579
01:14:34,490 --> 01:14:35,740
Come massage my feet.

580
01:14:36,365 --> 01:14:40,407
I don't know how.

581
01:14:42,490 --> 01:14:43,949
You do as I say.

582
01:15:13,449 --> 01:15:14,365
Softer.

583
01:15:18,407 --> 01:15:20,074
I said softer.

584
01:15:21,782 --> 01:15:22,990
I said I didn't know how.

585
01:15:24,115 --> 01:15:27,657
If you're able, get Aunt Cao to come.

586
01:15:41,824 --> 01:15:43,532
Leave it!

587
01:15:48,074 --> 01:15:52,115
"If I'm able"...
You just wait and see what I can do!

588
01:16:08,824 --> 01:16:09,865
She's really pregnant?

589
01:16:10,032 --> 01:16:11,074
Yes,

590
01:16:11,657 --> 01:16:14,615
Fourth Mistress hasn't been
looking well lately.

591
01:16:14,824 --> 01:16:18,990
Congratulations, Master.
You'll have another son.

592
01:16:19,824 --> 01:16:23,949
According to custom, from today...

593
01:16:24,157 --> 01:16:25,365
...the lanterns in this house...

594
01:16:25,532 --> 01:16:27,615
...will be lit day and night.

595
01:16:27,740 --> 01:16:33,324
Yes, day and night.
As a symbol of longevity.

596
01:16:33,657 --> 01:16:34,699
Go light the lanterns!

597
01:17:32,157 --> 01:17:37,865
Fourth Mistress,
drink this lotus seed soup.

598
01:17:48,199 --> 01:17:49,407
Aunt Cao,

599
01:17:50,324 --> 01:17:53,699
someone said I couldn't
get you to serve me.

600
01:17:54,407 --> 01:17:58,699
Who said this about our Fourth Mistress?

601
01:17:59,032 --> 01:18:01,615
You're very precious to us now.

602
01:18:02,074 --> 01:18:06,740
Call me anytime and I'll come.

603
01:18:27,782 --> 01:18:30,782
First Mistress, I'm bringing the
Fourth Mistress her food.

604
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:47,240
Big sister,

605
01:18:48,157 --> 01:18:52,449
did you do this when you were
pregnant with master Feipu?

606
01:18:55,657 --> 01:18:57,115
Why don't you eat?

607
01:19:00,949 --> 01:19:02,782
Third sister is truly a singer.

608
01:19:03,532 --> 01:19:05,407
Even her laughter sounds like music.

609
01:19:07,574 --> 01:19:09,032
But that's nothing.

610
01:19:09,824 --> 01:19:12,699
If fourth sister has a son...

611
01:19:13,657 --> 01:19:16,949
...someone will be very unhappy.

612
01:19:23,574 --> 01:19:25,657
All of this food can't shut
both of you up!

613
01:19:29,782 --> 01:19:31,949
Master asks the Second Mistress...

614
01:19:32,115 --> 01:19:34,449
...to go to the fourth house after lunch.

615
01:19:35,490 --> 01:19:36,490
Why?

616
01:19:36,865 --> 01:19:39,907
The Fourth Mistress isn't feeling well.

617
01:19:40,115 --> 01:19:43,740
Master wants you to give
her a back massage.

618
01:19:45,115 --> 01:19:46,865
She knows I can massage?

619
01:19:49,532 --> 01:19:55,365
Of course the master told her.

620
01:19:59,699 --> 01:20:01,199
It's the Master's idea?

621
01:20:01,532 --> 01:20:03,282
It's his order.

622
01:20:03,657 --> 01:20:06,032
Second sister, you must go.

623
01:20:07,490 --> 01:20:12,615
Show us how you take good
care of the Master.

624
01:20:13,699 --> 01:20:15,407
If fourth sister feels better,

625
01:20:15,657 --> 01:20:17,282
won't the Master be pleased?

626
01:20:36,574 --> 01:20:40,574
Feeling better?

627
01:20:42,324 --> 01:20:43,574
Much better.

628
01:20:44,740 --> 01:20:47,407
Softer, second sister.

629
01:20:51,699 --> 01:20:54,199
Right, just like this.

630
01:21:26,324 --> 01:21:31,282
It can't be! Are you sure it's blood?

631
01:21:31,699 --> 01:21:33,157
It looks like it.

632
01:21:44,907 --> 01:21:47,990
Yan'er!

633
01:21:53,199 --> 01:21:54,157
Yes, Fourth Mistress.

634
01:21:58,865 --> 01:22:01,490
What are you up to?

635
01:22:05,782 --> 01:22:07,907
Have you seen my white pants?

636
01:22:08,157 --> 01:22:09,324
I washed them.

637
01:22:10,365 --> 01:22:11,657
Washed them?

638
01:22:16,740 --> 01:22:20,532
"How happily they dance
and sing in the sky!"

639
01:22:20,699 --> 01:22:24,699
"Lush are the mountain flowers
and the trees high and low!"

640
01:22:24,907 --> 01:22:28,865
"Locked in a golden cage I pine away."

641
01:22:29,074 --> 01:22:37,074
"Let me return to the forest to
sing my carefree songs!"

642
01:22:37,324 --> 01:22:39,824
Good, the next poem.

643
01:22:40,115 --> 01:22:43,949
"The moon goes down,
crows cry under the frosty sky."

644
01:22:44,157 --> 01:22:51,282
"Dimly lit fishing boats beneath
maples sadly lie."

645
01:22:51,490 --> 01:22:54,865
"Beyond the Gusu walls
the Temple of Cold Hill."

646
01:22:55,115 --> 01:22:58,324
"Ringing bells reach my boat,
breaking the midnight still."

647
01:22:58,449 --> 01:23:00,782
Well done!

648
01:23:00,949 --> 01:23:03,907
Master, the Second Mistress
wishes to see you.

649
01:23:04,615 --> 01:23:05,574
Master.

650
01:23:06,740 --> 01:23:12,115
Fourth sister seems very tired lately.

651
01:23:12,490 --> 01:23:14,824
When I was pregnant...

652
01:23:15,157 --> 01:23:17,074
...I nearly had a miscarriage
and didn't even know it.

653
01:23:17,657 --> 01:23:21,115
You should ask Doctor Gao to come.

654
01:23:21,199 --> 01:23:24,490
Thank you for reminding me.

655
01:23:27,032 --> 01:23:31,615
Tomorrow, ask Doctor Gao
to visit the Fourth Mistress.

656
01:23:31,782 --> 01:23:32,615
Yes, Master.

657
01:23:34,949 --> 01:23:37,490
Doctor Gao has finished?

658
01:23:37,699 --> 01:23:38,449
Finished.

659
01:23:38,615 --> 01:23:39,449
Thank you, doctor.

660
01:23:40,074 --> 01:23:42,865
Where is the Master? I must speak to him.

661
01:23:42,990 --> 01:23:44,115
Please follow me.

662
01:23:47,407 --> 01:23:48,282
Doctor Gao...

663
01:23:50,240 --> 01:23:51,240
...you're here.

664
01:23:51,782 --> 01:23:53,115
Third Mistress,

665
01:23:54,865 --> 01:23:57,240
are you better after taking my medicine?

666
01:23:57,574 --> 01:24:03,157
Much better. Only I can't sleep at night.

667
01:24:06,449 --> 01:24:08,782
When I've time,
I'll change the prescription.

668
01:24:09,032 --> 01:24:09,949
Fine.

669
01:24:11,449 --> 01:24:13,740
How is fourth sister?

670
01:24:14,615 --> 01:24:17,407
I can't explain now. I'll tell you later.

671
01:24:22,990 --> 01:24:23,949
Doctor Gao!

672
01:24:24,449 --> 01:24:25,615
Second Mistress!

673
01:24:26,615 --> 01:24:29,032
How is fourth sister? Not serious, is it?

674
01:24:29,615 --> 01:24:31,282
I've got to see the master first.

675
01:24:38,782 --> 01:24:40,574
Sorry for troubling you, doctor.

676
01:24:40,824 --> 01:24:41,907
Not at all.

677
01:24:46,824 --> 01:24:48,157
Please have some tea.

678
01:24:52,282 --> 01:24:54,240
How is fourth sister?

679
01:24:59,115 --> 01:25:02,949
I don't know if I should be frank.

680
01:25:03,490 --> 01:25:06,824
Go, leave us alone.

681
01:25:23,449 --> 01:25:26,407
Is anything wrong with Songlian?

682
01:25:31,032 --> 01:25:34,782
Master,
the Fourth Mistress isn't pregnant.

683
01:25:35,365 --> 01:25:38,282
What? Is it true?

684
01:25:38,615 --> 01:25:40,449
I checked carefully.

685
01:25:40,615 --> 01:25:42,740
She isn't pregnant.

686
01:25:46,449 --> 01:25:50,199
You're trying to cheat me?

687
01:25:51,574 --> 01:25:58,490
Tell me, why did you lie?

688
01:26:01,699 --> 01:26:03,449
Don't you know we've rules in this family?

689
01:26:04,115 --> 01:26:06,949
Rules we've been following...

690
01:26:07,490 --> 01:26:11,074
...for many generations!

691
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:12,657
How dare you!

692
01:26:15,740 --> 01:26:17,282
- Cover the lanterns!
- What did you say, Master?

693
01:26:17,535 --> 01:26:18,660
Cover the lanterns!

694
01:26:31,326 --> 01:26:33,785
Cover the lanterns!

695
01:27:46,243 --> 01:27:47,076
Yan'er...

696
01:27:49,868 --> 01:27:53,035
Why did Doctor Gao come all of a sudden?

697
01:27:55,368 --> 01:27:56,826
Where are my white pants?

698
01:27:58,618 --> 01:27:59,785
I'll fetch them.

699
01:28:34,910 --> 01:28:38,035
A servant secretly
lighting lanterns in her room!

700
01:28:38,701 --> 01:28:40,576
Who let you put lanterns here?

701
01:28:41,660 --> 01:28:43,035
Who do you think you are?

702
01:28:43,785 --> 01:28:45,743
Have you no respect for the mistresses?

703
01:28:46,660 --> 01:28:48,243
Does this family have rules or not?

704
01:28:48,576 --> 01:28:51,160
Stop making a scene!

705
01:28:51,535 --> 01:28:53,660
Don't act like one of the servants.

706
01:28:53,910 --> 01:28:56,701
No, this is one of your rules.

707
01:28:57,868 --> 01:29:01,535
Rules are rules,

708
01:29:02,368 --> 01:29:04,326
but everyone can make mistakes.

709
01:29:07,701 --> 01:29:12,868
Let me remind you that they've
just covered your lanterns.

710
01:29:13,201 --> 01:29:14,826
But I am still a mistress.

711
01:29:16,201 --> 01:29:20,951
Mistresses are mistresses!
Maids are maids!

712
01:29:23,368 --> 01:29:25,993
Big sister, the Master is away...

713
01:29:26,868 --> 01:29:29,701
...In front of everyone here...

714
01:29:30,410 --> 01:29:31,451
...you be the judge.

715
01:29:32,326 --> 01:29:34,493
I broke a rule and they
covered my lanterns.

716
01:29:35,368 --> 01:29:39,618
What happens if a servant breaks the rule?

717
01:29:45,868 --> 01:29:47,118
Follow the old custom!

718
01:30:18,535 --> 01:30:19,785
The First Mistress said...

719
01:30:20,285 --> 01:30:27,160
...you could get up if you apologized.

720
01:30:27,868 --> 01:30:29,201
Why do this?

721
01:31:04,701 --> 01:31:06,493
Have her drink this hot ginger tea.

722
01:31:06,618 --> 01:31:07,951
It'll make her sweat.

723
01:31:08,118 --> 01:31:09,451
Has the doctor come?

724
01:31:09,618 --> 01:31:14,368
He came several times
but she isn't improving.

725
01:31:15,285 --> 01:31:16,660
The Master's back.

726
01:31:16,785 --> 01:31:19,493
Said to send her to the hospital.

727
01:31:19,701 --> 01:31:22,035
Who could tell the Fourth Mistress
would be so vicious?

728
01:31:23,035 --> 01:31:25,201
Yan'er shouldn't have made her angry.

729
01:31:33,951 --> 01:31:35,785
- Housekeeper.
- Yes, Master.

730
01:31:36,035 --> 01:31:38,618
Get her good medicine.
Never mind the money.

731
01:31:38,868 --> 01:31:41,868
Or people will say we let our servant die.

732
01:31:42,035 --> 01:31:43,535
Yes, Master.

733
01:32:28,076 --> 01:32:31,701
Light the lanterns at the second house!

734
01:34:15,868 --> 01:34:19,785
Fourth sister,
what are you doing here so early?

735
01:34:21,035 --> 01:34:23,701
I've come to listen to third sister sing.

736
01:34:24,785 --> 01:34:27,035
You sing so well.

737
01:34:27,493 --> 01:34:34,076
Good or bad, it's all playacting.

738
01:34:34,535 --> 01:34:37,076
If you play well, you fool the others.

739
01:34:37,868 --> 01:34:39,910
If you play badly,
you can only fool yourself.

740
01:34:41,118 --> 01:34:42,993
If you can't even fool yourself,

741
01:34:43,076 --> 01:34:44,868
you can fool the ghosts.

742
01:34:46,535 --> 01:34:48,826
People breathe, ghosts cannot.
That's the only difference.

743
01:34:49,951 --> 01:34:53,410
People are ghosts, and ghosts are people.

744
01:34:55,285 --> 01:34:58,576
Don't mind me for saying this...

745
01:34:59,368 --> 01:35:01,785
...but you shouldn't have made
such a fuss about Yan'er.

746
01:35:02,035 --> 01:35:07,618
She's only dreaming of
becoming a mistress.

747
01:35:08,035 --> 01:35:12,076
She's only scapegoat.
I was after someone else.

748
01:35:13,368 --> 01:35:17,868
Yes, she's only a maid.

749
01:35:18,035 --> 01:35:19,743
Someone is behind her.

750
01:35:20,826 --> 01:35:23,493
Look how pleased Zhuoyun was last night.

751
01:35:25,076 --> 01:35:29,701
She thinks she's so smart.
I'll take care of her soon!

752
01:35:31,868 --> 01:35:35,326
Light the lanterns, blow out the lanterns,
cover the lanterns.

753
01:35:36,243 --> 01:35:37,868
What do I care?

754
01:35:38,701 --> 01:35:44,118
What do people amount to in this house?

755
01:35:44,951 --> 01:35:49,118
They're like dogs, cats or rats.

756
01:35:49,326 --> 01:35:52,118
But certainly not people.

757
01:35:52,868 --> 01:35:58,160
Isn't it better to hang
yourself in that room?

758
01:35:58,368 --> 01:36:02,035
Don't talk about dying.

759
01:36:02,535 --> 01:36:06,035
Why think about what people are like?
Just go on living.

760
01:36:12,410 --> 01:36:14,660
Don't be so unhappy.

761
01:36:15,493 --> 01:36:21,285
Look at me. I always keep myself amused.

762
01:36:21,951 --> 01:36:24,368
Of course you're happy.

763
01:36:25,035 --> 01:36:27,951
You've got Doctor Gao.

764
01:36:31,368 --> 01:36:33,076
What do you mean by that?

765
01:36:34,785 --> 01:36:36,201
Nothing.

766
01:36:36,826 --> 01:36:39,451
I should thank him for coming to see me.

767
01:36:41,368 --> 01:36:45,035
Don't joke about this.

768
01:36:46,285 --> 01:36:48,576
If you tell anyone,

769
01:36:49,826 --> 01:36:52,410
you'll have me to deal with.

770
01:36:53,993 --> 01:36:57,285
To be honest, I'm meeting him soon.

771
01:36:57,576 --> 01:36:59,285
What can they do to me?

772
01:37:13,618 --> 01:37:16,618
Fourth Mistress...

773
01:37:22,576 --> 01:37:25,160
You frightened me.

774
01:37:25,410 --> 01:37:27,201
I thought nobody was here.

775
01:37:32,035 --> 01:37:39,160
Master said I'd be your maid from now on.

776
01:37:39,535 --> 01:37:45,951
I may be old, but I'm experienced.

777
01:37:46,410 --> 01:37:49,118
Not like those young girls.

778
01:37:49,201 --> 01:37:50,993
Get me some wine.

779
01:37:51,576 --> 01:37:54,868
What? I didn't hear you.

780
01:37:55,660 --> 01:38:00,368
Bring me some wine. Today's my brithday.

781
01:38:00,493 --> 01:38:02,618
Your birthday?

782
01:38:03,410 --> 01:38:04,451
How old are you?

783
01:38:05,410 --> 01:38:06,451
Twenty.

784
01:38:06,618 --> 01:38:10,410
Why didn't you say so earlier?

785
01:38:10,826 --> 01:38:11,826
I'll get the wine.

786
01:38:15,785 --> 01:38:19,535
The wine is here.

787
01:38:32,201 --> 01:38:33,660
Why are you looking at me that way?

788
01:38:34,076 --> 01:38:35,493
Yan'er is dead.

789
01:38:40,451 --> 01:38:42,160
She died in the hospital.

790
01:38:48,451 --> 01:38:49,660
When?

791
01:38:50,201 --> 01:38:51,201
I don't know.

792
01:38:52,701 --> 01:38:57,285
They said she died calling your name.

793
01:38:59,535 --> 01:39:04,451
Why? Did she think I killed her?

794
01:39:06,076 --> 01:39:09,160
I'm only repeating what they said.

795
01:39:09,618 --> 01:39:13,160
She can't blame you. It's her destiny.

796
01:39:15,993 --> 01:39:17,160
Where is she now?

797
01:39:19,785 --> 01:39:22,826
Her family took the body
back to the village.

798
01:39:24,410 --> 01:39:28,493
They were all crying. It was very sad.

799
01:39:45,076 --> 01:39:46,660
Why cry?

800
01:39:48,160 --> 01:39:51,243
It's better dead than alive and suffering.

801
01:39:52,285 --> 01:39:53,826
She's lucky to have died.

802
01:39:54,618 --> 01:39:58,826
Fourth Mistress, stop drinking!
You're drunk!

803
01:39:58,951 --> 01:40:03,285
I'm happy today. It's my birthday.

804
01:40:03,910 --> 01:40:07,493
My twentieth birthday.

805
01:40:09,576 --> 01:40:10,826
Young master, you're back?

806
01:40:11,410 --> 01:40:14,118
Please talk to the Fourth Mistress.

807
01:40:14,368 --> 01:40:16,201
She's drunk!

808
01:40:18,743 --> 01:40:21,368
You're back, young master.

809
01:40:21,701 --> 01:40:23,326
Why are you drinking?

810
01:40:24,785 --> 01:40:25,785
Sit down.

811
01:40:29,785 --> 01:40:31,910
I'm celebrating my birthday.

812
01:40:34,535 --> 01:40:37,701
Have a drink. Congratulate me.

813
01:40:46,035 --> 01:40:49,535
Alright, I'll have some.

814
01:40:50,326 --> 01:40:51,701
May you live to be 99.

815
01:40:54,535 --> 01:40:59,368
Nonsense! I don't want to live that long.

816
01:41:00,535 --> 01:41:03,493
Save such wishes for your father.

817
01:41:08,451 --> 01:41:09,993
I heard what happened.

818
01:41:12,201 --> 01:41:13,368
You're so foolish.

819
01:41:14,618 --> 01:41:18,326
How long could you lie
about being pregnant?

820
01:41:19,951 --> 01:41:22,535
Foolish? I'm not foolish.

821
01:41:24,826 --> 01:41:28,993
I had it planned. At first it was a lie.

822
01:41:30,285 --> 01:41:32,535
But if the Master stayed with me,

823
01:41:33,701 --> 01:41:35,993
soon it would be true.

824
01:41:38,410 --> 01:41:42,243
I was planning this,
but they were plotting against me.

825
01:41:43,701 --> 01:41:48,201
Everyone is plotting against each other.

826
01:41:50,201 --> 01:41:52,285
What is the meaning of all this?

827
01:41:57,118 --> 01:41:58,743
This is from Yunnan.

828
01:41:59,076 --> 01:42:00,910
Take it as your birthday gift.

829
01:42:07,868 --> 01:42:11,243
Only women give this to men.

830
01:42:13,285 --> 01:42:14,993
Not the other way around.

831
01:42:17,826 --> 01:42:21,160
Don't want it? Never mind.
Someone gave it to me.

832
01:42:21,868 --> 01:42:29,160
Hypocrite! Which woman gave it to you?

833
01:42:32,826 --> 01:42:36,451
If I take it, won't my hands be soiled?

834
01:42:38,701 --> 01:42:41,285
I was just fooling. Wasn't really
going to let you have it.

835
01:42:43,701 --> 01:42:47,451
Fooling? I'm used to being fooled.

836
01:42:49,951 --> 01:42:51,368
Everyone is fooling me.

837
01:42:54,368 --> 01:42:55,493
And now you?

838
01:43:00,368 --> 01:43:05,910
Get out! Get out of here!

839
01:43:09,701 --> 01:43:10,535
Feipu!

840
01:43:21,576 --> 01:43:22,493
I'm going.

841
01:43:51,785 --> 01:43:55,118
Master! Master!

842
01:43:55,368 --> 01:43:56,201
Fourth Mistress, please stop!

843
01:43:57,035 --> 01:43:58,493
Why is she drinking?

844
01:43:59,868 --> 01:44:01,118
She wants to drink.

845
01:44:01,368 --> 01:44:03,535
Ask the first Mistress for
medicine to sober her up!

846
01:44:03,701 --> 01:44:09,201
Don't go to that old witch!

847
01:44:10,368 --> 01:44:11,910
See how crazy you look!

848
01:44:12,868 --> 01:44:13,826
People will laugh!

849
01:44:14,660 --> 01:44:19,160
What is there to laugh at?

850
01:44:19,868 --> 01:44:21,535
The Master likes you.

851
01:44:21,951 --> 01:44:24,576
Meishan has gone to meet
her good-looking doctor.

852
01:44:24,743 --> 01:44:28,826
What do I have? I've nothing! Nothing!

853
01:44:29,660 --> 01:44:30,826
Where is Meishan?

854
01:44:33,785 --> 01:44:36,285
She's meeting the good-looking doctor.

855
01:44:36,493 --> 01:44:40,660
What do I have? Nothing!

856
01:44:41,701 --> 01:44:43,451
When did the Third Mistress go out?

857
01:44:44,201 --> 01:44:45,326
I don't know.

858
01:44:47,201 --> 01:44:50,243
What am I afraid of? Nothing!

859
01:44:57,201 --> 01:44:57,951
Big sister!

860
01:44:58,535 --> 01:45:01,993
The medicine is here. Make her drink it.

861
01:45:02,243 --> 01:45:04,035
I won't! I'm not drunk!

862
01:45:04,285 --> 01:45:06,160
Don't just stand there!

863
01:45:06,243 --> 01:45:07,410
Hold that crazy woman!

864
01:45:07,576 --> 01:45:10,868
Hold her down! Quick!

865
01:45:16,160 --> 01:45:20,618
Get out!

866
01:45:23,451 --> 01:45:27,826
Let her scream!
Let her make a fool of herself!

867
01:45:28,076 --> 01:45:30,660
The Master's away and she's
turned the house upside down!

868
01:47:13,493 --> 01:47:15,576
Fourth sister, are you sober now?

869
01:47:18,951 --> 01:47:21,035
I'm glad you told me yesterday.

870
01:47:21,410 --> 01:47:23,993
Or there would be such a scandal!

871
01:47:26,243 --> 01:47:28,451
It's cold here. Go back to your room.

872
01:47:37,118 --> 01:47:39,660
What happened?

873
01:47:39,868 --> 01:47:47,285
The Third Mistress and Doctor Gao
were in a hotel in town.

874
01:47:48,118 --> 01:47:50,660
When the Second Mistress
had the door opened...

875
01:47:50,910 --> 01:47:53,035
...they were still in bed.

876
01:47:53,326 --> 01:47:54,993
Such sin!

877
01:47:55,910 --> 01:47:59,868
Did the Second Mistress say I told her?

878
01:48:01,326 --> 01:48:08,035
You told her when you
were drunk yesterday.

879
01:48:08,535 --> 01:48:11,910
I was so shocked.

880
01:48:14,201 --> 01:48:18,826
I said it?

881
01:48:19,160 --> 01:48:20,576
You did.

882
01:48:21,118 --> 01:48:24,535
I wondered why you told her.

883
01:48:25,160 --> 01:48:27,160
Is it that you hate the doctor?

884
01:48:27,785 --> 01:48:32,160
You drank a lot yesterday.
You can't remember.

885
01:48:36,910 --> 01:48:39,410
What will happen to the Third sister?

886
01:48:39,618 --> 01:48:42,035
They've gone to fetch the Master.

887
01:48:43,076 --> 01:48:49,160
What must happen... will happen.

888
01:48:49,993 --> 01:48:54,160
Go and rest. Or you'll catch cold.

889
01:48:54,993 --> 01:48:59,951
Such heavy snow! Must be a bad year!

890
01:53:45,368 --> 01:53:46,701
Murderers!

891
01:53:47,951 --> 01:53:54,993
Murderers!

892
01:53:59,160 --> 01:54:04,243
Murderers!

893
01:54:25,493 --> 01:54:26,701
The Master is here.

894
01:54:28,826 --> 01:54:29,993
- Master
- Master

895
01:54:30,368 --> 01:54:31,201
The Master is back.

896
01:54:44,035 --> 01:54:48,285
What did you see?

897
01:54:49,368 --> 01:54:50,910
You murderers!

898
01:54:51,535 --> 01:54:54,993
Meishan is dead. You murderers!

899
01:54:55,160 --> 01:54:59,618
Nonsense! What did you see?

900
01:55:00,410 --> 01:55:01,910
You didn't see a thing!

901
01:55:02,451 --> 01:55:05,660
Murderers! You murderers!

902
01:55:05,868 --> 01:55:11,035
You're mad! You're gone mad!

903
01:55:11,910 --> 01:55:18,410
Murderers... You murderers!

904
01:55:30,285 --> 01:55:32,451
Housekeeper!

905
01:55:33,076 --> 01:55:35,660
Housekeeper!

906
01:55:37,035 --> 01:55:41,451
Housekeeper! The lanterns are lit!

907
01:55:41,618 --> 01:55:42,660
What happened?

908
01:55:42,868 --> 01:55:47,368
The lanterns in the third house are lit!

909
01:55:47,535 --> 01:55:48,285
What... What?

910
01:55:48,368 --> 01:55:49,118
Where?

911
01:55:49,285 --> 01:55:50,160
It's haunted!

912
01:55:50,785 --> 01:55:53,993
It's the Third Mistress' ghost!

913
01:56:46,368 --> 01:56:51,535
The Third Mistress is singing!

914
01:57:10,743 --> 01:57:14,785
It's haunted!

915
01:59:38,368 --> 01:59:44,076
The housekeeper congratulates
the Fifth Mistress on her wedding.

916
02:00:22,493 --> 02:00:23,993
Who is that?

917
02:00:25,326 --> 02:00:28,951
She was our Fourth Mistress.
She has gone mad.
