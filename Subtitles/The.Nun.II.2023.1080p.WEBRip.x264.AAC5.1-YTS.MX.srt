[rapid footsteps approaching]

00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:18,448
-You're late, Jacques.
-Sorry, Father.

5
00:01:18,482 --> 00:01:19,749
Go fetch the wine.

6
00:01:19,783 --> 00:01:20,684
[Jacques under his breath]
Why don't

7
00:01:20,717 --> 00:01:22,052
you go fetch the wine?

8
00:01:22,085 --> 00:01:23,720
-Pardon?
-[Jacques] Er, nothing.

9
00:01:24,621 --> 00:01:26,256
[tolling continuing]

10
00:01:50,614 --> 00:01:53,149
[priest] Let your spirit
come upon these gifts

11
00:01:53,183 --> 00:01:57,087
to make them holy
so that they may become for us,

12
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:01,791
the body and blood of our Lord,
Jesus Christ.

13
00:02:01,826 --> 00:02:03,593
[bell tinkles]

14
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,064
Body of Christ.

15
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:09,132
[woman] Amen.

16
00:02:12,202 --> 00:02:13,804
-The blood of Christ.
-Amen.

[footsteps approaching]

22
00:04:24,367 --> 00:04:25,535
-Father.
-Yes?

23
00:04:25,568 --> 00:04:27,303
-There's someone here.
-Where?

24
00:04:27,337 --> 00:04:28,571

[breath exhaling]

29
00:05:02,006 --> 00:05:03,707
Who's there?

30
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,241
[objects clattering]

31
00:05:05,275 --> 00:05:09,245
Whoever you are,
whatever you are here for,

32
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:10,380
you are in a house of God.

33
00:05:12,282 --> 00:05:13,383
And He's watching you.

34
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:14,751

00:05:25,729 --> 00:05:27,297

[engine revving]

46
00:07:05,428 --> 00:07:06,931
Get this under the other tire.

48
00:07:20,443 --> 00:07:22,445
[all laughing]

49
00:07:35,758 --> 00:07:39,129
[Reverend Mother] Sister Irene!
Sister Irene!

50
00:07:41,464 --> 00:07:42,432
Sister Debra.

51
00:07:42,465 --> 00:07:44,434
It's Sister Debra.

52
00:07:44,467 --> 00:07:45,535
[Reverend Mother]
<i>She's trouble.</i>

53
00:07:45,568 --> 00:07:48,404
Every day she's making trouble.

54
00:07:48,438 --> 00:07:51,075
And now, she refused
to go to confession.

55
00:07:51,108 --> 00:07:53,811
[speaks Italian]

56
00:07:53,844 --> 00:07:55,578
[in English] And you know why?

57
00:07:55,612 --> 00:07:59,749
She did not think
she had anything to confess.

58
00:07:59,782 --> 00:08:02,785
For that alone,
she should be confessing.

59
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,587
I will have a talk with her,
Reverend Mother.

60
00:08:04,621 --> 00:08:05,890
<i>Grazie,</i> Sister.

61
00:08:16,799 --> 00:08:17,935
Sister Debra?

62
00:08:19,069 --> 00:08:20,470
Sister Irene.

63
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:23,573
This about confession?

64
00:08:23,606 --> 00:08:25,109
You're going to give the Mother
a heart attack.

65
00:08:25,142 --> 00:08:27,477
Well, then maybe
I'll have something to confess.

66
00:08:30,014 --> 00:08:31,681
[stifles laugh]

67
00:08:37,922 --> 00:08:39,422
Your father
sent you here, right?

68
00:08:41,591 --> 00:08:44,527
Yes. I was different.

69
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,065
Sending me away was easier than
trying to understand who I was.

70
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:51,567
What'd your mama
say about that?

71
00:08:57,774 --> 00:08:59,109
I barely remember her.

72
00:09:00,878 --> 00:09:03,080
But my father always said
I was just like her.

73
00:09:05,581 --> 00:09:07,117
I don't think he meant it
as a compliment.

74
00:09:11,554 --> 00:09:15,658
Well, my family's
from Mississippi,

75
00:09:15,692 --> 00:09:18,128
but we ran into some trouble
down there.

76
00:09:18,162 --> 00:09:21,531
When I was four, white folks,
they found where we were,

77
00:09:21,564 --> 00:09:22,765
burned our house down.

78
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,805
After that,
my brothers joined the army.

79
00:09:27,838 --> 00:09:30,975
My dad figured,
"My boys can serve country,

80
00:09:31,008 --> 00:09:33,210
my daughter can serve God."

81
00:09:34,777 --> 00:09:36,280
Never in my wildest dreams
did I think

82
00:09:36,313 --> 00:09:38,048
I was gonna end up here.

83
00:09:41,751 --> 00:09:43,619
Do I still have
to go to confession?

84
00:09:46,023 --> 00:09:47,590
I think
you've confessed enough.

85
00:09:49,259 --> 00:09:50,760
[elder sister] One by one,

86
00:09:50,793 --> 00:09:54,064
the sisters
found themselves murdered.

87
00:09:54,098 --> 00:09:58,869
Hanging from windows.
Throat slit open.

88
00:09:58,902 --> 00:10:00,938
Acts of suicide.

89
00:10:00,971 --> 00:10:03,539
[whispers] Sometimes worse.

90
00:10:03,573 --> 00:10:06,709
They learned
that beneath their remote abbey

91
00:10:06,743 --> 00:10:09,847
was a terrible secret.

92
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,715
A gateway to hell.

93
00:10:12,749 --> 00:10:17,787
And from this gateway,
a demon had escaped.

94
00:10:19,823 --> 00:10:23,127
Now, we know that a demon
can take any form,

95
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:27,563
but they choose their form
to challenge your faith

96
00:10:27,597 --> 00:10:29,632
and to weaken your spirits.

97
00:10:31,601 --> 00:10:35,839
Now, for the nuns
of Saint Carta,

98
00:10:35,873 --> 00:10:40,044
this demon
chose the most ungodly,

99
00:10:40,077 --> 00:10:43,814
the most blasphemous form.

100
00:10:43,847 --> 00:10:47,317
It chose
to look like one of them.

101
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:51,021
[Sister Debra]
And then what happened?

102
00:10:51,055 --> 00:10:54,724
Well, the Vatican sent in
a pair of demon hunters.

103
00:10:54,757 --> 00:10:59,029
A priest and a nun.

104
00:10:59,063 --> 00:11:01,932
-And how did they stop it?
-[elder sister] Great question.

105
00:11:01,965 --> 00:11:04,767
They used an ancient relic,

106
00:11:04,802 --> 00:11:11,607
a vial which contained
the blood of Jesus Christ.

107
00:11:11,641 --> 00:11:15,813
So, they returned as heroes,
kissed the Pope's ring.

108
00:11:15,846 --> 00:11:18,614
Priest was made a bishop.

109
00:11:18,648 --> 00:11:20,951
[sister 2]
What happened to the nun?

110
00:11:20,984 --> 00:11:23,320
[elder sister]
Well, no one really knows.

111
00:11:23,353 --> 00:11:26,156
They say the experience
was too much for her.

112
00:11:27,191 --> 00:11:30,726
Some say that she went mad.

113
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,331
The Vatican had to lock her up
in an asylum.

114
00:11:49,246 --> 00:11:52,049
[Celeste] Gotcha! Quick!

115
00:11:52,082 --> 00:11:53,984
Why does Madame
have so much wine?

116
00:11:54,017 --> 00:11:55,219
[girl] This used
to be a monastery.

117
00:11:55,252 --> 00:11:57,020
The monks were all fat drunks.

118
00:11:57,054 --> 00:11:58,155
[laughs]

119
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:02,593
[both giggling]

120
00:12:04,895 --> 00:12:06,029
[both laughing]

121
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:19,309
Everyone downstairs, please.
It's nearly eight o'clock.

122
00:12:19,343 --> 00:12:20,410
Come on, now.

123
00:12:22,346 --> 00:12:23,746
[indistinct chatter]

124
00:12:25,949 --> 00:12:27,084
[Celeste] I got 'em.

125
00:12:29,052 --> 00:12:30,320
Took you long enough.

126
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,814
[Madame Laurent]
Hail Mary, full of grace,

127
00:12:57,848 --> 00:12:58,882
the Lord is with thee.

128
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:00,384
Blessed art thou among women,

129
00:13:00,417 --> 00:13:03,854
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

130
00:13:03,887 --> 00:13:07,090
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners now

131
00:13:07,124 --> 00:13:08,959
and at the hour
of our-- [screams]

132
00:13:08,992 --> 00:13:10,260
Jesus Christ!

133
00:13:10,294 --> 00:13:11,295
Bloody hell!

134
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:30,948
Kate.

135
00:13:32,782 --> 00:13:35,319
-Good morning.
-Hard at work already?

136
00:13:35,352 --> 00:13:36,386
Always.

137
00:13:39,289 --> 00:13:40,324
Good morning, Maurice.

138
00:13:41,825 --> 00:13:42,792
Captain!

139
00:13:45,162 --> 00:13:46,430
Come on now, Sophie.

140
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:51,535
-Hi, Maurice.
-Morning.

141
00:13:51,568 --> 00:13:53,971
-Morning, Maurice.
-Ladies.

142
00:13:54,004 --> 00:13:56,440
Hey, Maurice, do you wanna play
baseball with us today?

143
00:13:56,473 --> 00:13:58,275
Course, I do. You know what?

144
00:13:58,308 --> 00:14:02,145
I'll teach you how
to throw a knuckleball. [blows]

145
00:14:02,179 --> 00:14:04,481
-[Sophie] Maurice. Maurice.
-Oh. Captain Sophie.

146
00:14:04,514 --> 00:14:06,483
Lieutenant.

147
00:14:06,516 --> 00:14:09,486
I made this for you.
It's a friendship bracelet.

148
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:10,954
Each bead represents

149
00:14:10,988 --> 00:14:12,289
a different quality
of a good friend.

150
00:14:12,322 --> 00:14:14,157
Wow. It's beautiful, Sophie.
Thank you.

151
00:14:14,191 --> 00:14:17,127
[girls laughing]
Woo-hoo! Woo! Woo!

152
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,030
Are you proposing to
your boyfriend, little Sophie?

153
00:14:23,967 --> 00:14:25,569
-Give it back.
-You can't make me.

154
00:14:25,602 --> 00:14:28,171
You're not a teacher.
You're the servant.

155
00:14:38,282 --> 00:14:39,950
Even the servant knows

156
00:14:39,983 --> 00:14:43,387
you should treat everyone
with kindness and respect.

157
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,988
[whistle blows]

158
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:48,358
-Girls.
-[girls] Oui, Madame.

159
00:14:48,392 --> 00:14:53,997
What do you think you're doing?
This is not a playground!

160
00:14:54,031 --> 00:14:56,033
-Get to class!
- <i>Oui,</i> Madame.

161
00:14:56,066 --> 00:14:59,036
-And you, Maurice.
-[Maurice] Mm?

162
00:14:59,069 --> 00:15:01,538
There was a cockroach
in my quarters again.

163
00:15:01,571 --> 00:15:02,973
Ah, that's unfortunate.

164
00:15:03,006 --> 00:15:05,309
It's an infestation.
It's disgusting.

165
00:15:05,342 --> 00:15:08,145
I'll tend to it right away.

166
00:15:08,178 --> 00:15:10,080
-You'd better.
-I promise.

167
00:15:12,115 --> 00:15:14,551
Captain! Captain! Wait.

168
00:15:20,257 --> 00:15:21,124
[blows]

169
00:15:25,262 --> 00:15:26,430
How did you do that?

170
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:28,165
Skills I learned
from another life.

171
00:15:29,232 --> 00:15:31,201
How do I look?

172
00:15:31,234 --> 00:15:32,936
Come on, get to class. Come on.

[gurgling, choking continues]

188
00:18:08,492 --> 00:18:09,993
Are you okay?

189
00:18:22,807 --> 00:18:24,641

-[cicadas chirping]
-[distant owl hoots]

197
00:19:22,265 --> 00:19:23,700
[Abbess] Sister.

198
00:19:25,803 --> 00:19:27,537
You have a visitor.

199
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:55,131
Reverend Mother?

200
00:20:01,304 --> 00:20:02,606
[lightbulb rattles]

201
00:20:16,553 --> 00:20:17,621
[gasps]

202
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:21,424
Maurice?

203
00:20:25,896 --> 00:20:27,297
Save me, Sister.

204
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:29,299
[roars]

205
00:20:29,332 --> 00:20:31,869
-[gasping]
-Irene! It's okay. It's okay.

206
00:20:31,902 --> 00:20:33,703
You're fine. You're fine.

207
00:20:34,504 --> 00:20:35,505
Your nose.

208
00:20:56,292 --> 00:20:57,761
[Abbess] Sister Irene.

209
00:20:58,963 --> 00:21:00,497
You have a visitor.

210
00:21:16,646 --> 00:21:18,181
[footsteps approaching]

211
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:28,425
[Cardinal Conroy] Sister Irene.

212
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:29,759
Your Eminence.

213
00:21:31,428 --> 00:21:33,263
[Cardinal Conroy]
There has been an incident.

214
00:21:34,264 --> 00:21:36,533
A series of them.

215
00:21:36,566 --> 00:21:40,270
Szeleste, a small village
in Hungary.

216
00:21:40,303 --> 00:21:43,773
A 90-year-old nun shot herself
on the steps of her church.

217
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:45,843
Graz, Austria.

218
00:21:45,876 --> 00:21:48,012
A priest cut his throat open
with a rosary

219
00:21:48,045 --> 00:21:49,814
during Christmas mass.

220
00:21:49,847 --> 00:21:51,314
Edolo, Italy.

221
00:21:51,347 --> 00:21:54,517
A novitiate threw herself
out a window.

222
00:21:54,551 --> 00:21:56,720
Sound familiar?

223
00:21:56,753 --> 00:21:59,456
Just a month ago,
in Tarascon, France,

224
00:21:59,489 --> 00:22:01,926
another priest,
murdered inside his church.

225
00:22:01,959 --> 00:22:03,727
Immolated.

226
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,664
Notice a pattern?
It's moving west across Europe.

227
00:22:07,697 --> 00:22:09,867
But its origins point
to Romania.

228
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:13,636
-It can't be.
-The demon lives.

229
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:14,939
Have you spoken
with Father Burke?

230
00:22:14,972 --> 00:22:16,539
Father Burke is dead.

231
00:22:18,308 --> 00:22:20,777
-How?
-Cholera.

232
00:22:20,811 --> 00:22:22,445
[Cardinal Conroy] You are
the only person alive

233
00:22:22,479 --> 00:22:24,380
who has dealt
with something like this.

234
00:22:24,414 --> 00:22:27,550
The Church would like
<i>you</i> to investigate.

235
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:31,721
Find out what it wants
and where it's going next.

236
00:22:32,689 --> 00:22:33,590
No.

237
00:22:35,391 --> 00:22:36,994
I'm sorry?

238
00:22:37,027 --> 00:22:39,429
I said, "No."

239
00:22:39,462 --> 00:22:41,598
-I can't do it.
-Can't, or won't?

240
00:22:41,631 --> 00:22:44,634
You don't know what happened
at Saint Carta.

241
00:22:44,667 --> 00:22:46,402
I was lucky
to make it out alive.

242
00:22:46,436 --> 00:22:49,405
You're right. I don't know
what you faced back there.

243
00:22:49,439 --> 00:22:53,576
But in that abbey, Sister,
you performed a miracle.

244
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:55,545
The Church needs another.

245
00:23:05,588 --> 00:23:07,490
[whistle blows]

246
00:23:11,427 --> 00:23:13,496
[breath exhaling]

247
00:23:15,532 --> 00:23:17,034
-[Sister Debra] Here you are.
-Sister?

248
00:23:17,067 --> 00:23:19,369
Was afraid I almost hopped
on the wrong train.

249
00:23:19,402 --> 00:23:20,805
What are you doing here?

250
00:23:20,838 --> 00:23:22,639
Looking after you.

251
00:23:22,672 --> 00:23:24,909
-Someone's gotta.
-Sister, you could be expelled.

252
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:26,977
Why are you here?

253
00:23:35,718 --> 00:23:36,686
My mama.

254
00:23:38,122 --> 00:23:40,024
She died in the fire.

255
00:23:40,057 --> 00:23:41,691
She was my church.

256
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:46,729
I want to believe in miracles.

257
00:23:46,763 --> 00:23:48,464
But when I see
the priest stand up

258
00:23:48,498 --> 00:23:51,035
and say he turned the wine
into the blood of Christ,

259
00:23:51,068 --> 00:23:53,536
I mean,
it's kind of hard to believe.

260
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:54,939
It's an act of faith.

261
00:23:54,972 --> 00:23:57,373
He just says a bunch
of words to wine.

262
00:23:57,407 --> 00:24:01,578
The wine becomes the blood
of Christ because we believe.

263
00:24:01,611 --> 00:24:03,446
The most extraordinary
parts of our faith

264
00:24:03,479 --> 00:24:05,615
are only real
because we believe in them.

265
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:08,751
I guess so.

266
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:11,688
You're not ready.

267
00:24:12,455 --> 00:24:13,924
Why?

268
00:24:13,958 --> 00:24:16,994
An entire convent of nuns died
facing this thing.

269
00:24:17,027 --> 00:24:19,930
Women who dedicated
their lives to their faith.

270
00:24:19,964 --> 00:24:21,564
Then sacrificed their lives

271
00:24:21,598 --> 00:24:22,833
because they believed
in something greater.

272
00:24:24,567 --> 00:24:25,635
You need me.

273
00:24:29,639 --> 00:24:32,076
I just hope you can find
your faith when the time comes.

274
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:42,052
[church bell tolling]

275
00:24:48,125 --> 00:24:50,560
[Sophie] "Why, get you gone.
Who is't that hinders you?"

276
00:24:50,593 --> 00:24:52,595
[Kate] "A foolish heart
that I leave here behind."

277
00:24:52,629 --> 00:24:54,131
[Sophie] "What, with Lysander?"

278
00:24:54,164 --> 00:24:55,866
"With Demetrius."

279
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,836
"Be not afraid. She shall not
harm thee, Helena."

280
00:24:58,869 --> 00:25:02,572
[girl] "No, sir, she shall not,
though you take her part."

281
00:25:02,605 --> 00:25:06,676
"O, when she is angry,
she is keen and shrewd.

282
00:25:06,709 --> 00:25:09,013
She was a vixen
when she went to school.

283
00:25:09,046 --> 00:25:12,448
And though she be but little,
she is fierce."

284
00:25:12,482 --> 00:25:14,051
[girl 2] "Little again!

285
00:25:14,084 --> 00:25:18,055
Nothing but low and little!
Why will you suffer her--"

286
00:25:18,088 --> 00:25:20,824
Uh, let's take a break.
Fifteen minutes.

287
00:25:20,858 --> 00:25:22,893
[girl 2] I was just getting
into character.

288
00:25:22,927 --> 00:25:25,829
[girl 3] Yeah,
an awful character.

289
00:25:25,863 --> 00:25:27,697
[Kate] All right, girls.
Slowly, now.

290
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:28,966
[Maurice] Girls.

291
00:25:28,999 --> 00:25:30,968
Sweetheart,
take these to the office.

292
00:25:36,974 --> 00:25:38,042
[whispering] You're the best.

293
00:25:42,112 --> 00:25:44,480
I heard there was
a faulty cabinet in the area?

294
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:47,818
The latch won't open.

295
00:25:47,851 --> 00:25:49,186
-May I?
-Oh, please.

296
00:25:56,093 --> 00:25:57,861
Yeah. It's stuck.

297
00:25:57,895 --> 00:26:01,065
Can you just, please,
put a little pressure here?

298
00:26:01,098 --> 00:26:03,100
Yeah. Just here.

299
00:26:04,168 --> 00:26:05,768
All right. Thanks.

300
00:26:09,139 --> 00:26:11,175
Looks like we share
the latest fashion.

301
00:26:14,011 --> 00:26:14,979
I guess we do.

302
00:26:15,745 --> 00:26:16,779
Okay.

303
00:26:22,618 --> 00:26:23,653
[Kate] Oh!

304
00:26:25,189 --> 00:26:26,689
Voila!

305
00:26:26,723 --> 00:26:28,092
Thanks a many.

306
00:26:28,125 --> 00:26:29,193
All right.

307
00:26:30,861 --> 00:26:31,962
Okay.

308
00:26:35,598 --> 00:26:39,003
She's a great kid.
You must be proud.

309
00:26:40,237 --> 00:26:41,504
I am.

310
00:27:00,024 --> 00:27:01,025
Need some help?

311
00:27:02,893 --> 00:27:04,928
No, I'm okay.

312
00:27:04,962 --> 00:27:07,931
Relax, Sophie.
We're not going to do anything.

313
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:10,533
Cross my heart.

314
00:27:13,103 --> 00:27:16,706
That was pretty mean
of us earlier.

315
00:27:16,739 --> 00:27:18,842
-I was a bitch.
-[girls laugh]

316
00:27:22,046 --> 00:27:22,980
It's okay.

317
00:27:24,148 --> 00:27:25,983
What are you doing after this?

318
00:27:26,016 --> 00:27:27,985
We have to go back to class.

319
00:27:28,018 --> 00:27:29,953
Not for another ten minutes.

320
00:27:29,987 --> 00:27:31,754
Do you want to have some fun?

321
00:27:33,656 --> 00:27:35,658
[indistinct chatter]

322
00:27:42,765 --> 00:27:45,235
Madame says
the chapel is off limits.

323
00:27:45,269 --> 00:27:46,303
[girl] I know.

324
00:28:09,259 --> 00:28:11,028
[wood creaking]

325
00:28:38,922 --> 00:28:40,190

[ominous music playing]

327
00:28:59,709 --> 00:29:02,913
-What are we doing here?
-Playing a game.

328
00:29:02,946 --> 00:29:05,983
It's called "Defy the Devil."

329
00:29:07,851 --> 00:29:11,088
-I don't see any devil.
-[girls scoff]

330
00:29:12,289 --> 00:29:14,690
The devil is always here.

331
00:29:14,724 --> 00:29:17,094
You're just not looking
carefully enough.

332
00:29:20,864 --> 00:29:26,203
It depends on where you stand
and when you look.

333
00:29:28,105 --> 00:29:30,874
At the right time of day...

334
00:29:30,908 --> 00:29:36,013
the sun hits the glass
at just the right angle.

335
00:29:36,046 --> 00:29:38,415
And if you're watching
carefully,

336
00:29:38,448 --> 00:29:40,250
he looks right at you.

337
00:29:41,885 --> 00:29:44,922
The rumor is, if you look away,

338
00:29:44,955 --> 00:29:49,960
the devil will appear in
the form of a monstrous goat.

339
00:29:56,066 --> 00:29:58,802
[whispering] See?
He's watching you.

340
00:30:01,071 --> 00:30:02,906
Whatever you do,

341
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:05,342
whatever you hear,

342
00:30:05,375 --> 00:30:07,277
don't look away.

343
00:30:28,966 --> 00:30:31,001
[deep rumble]

344
00:30:37,374 --> 00:30:39,376

-[pounding, shouting]

350
00:31:17,547 --> 00:31:19,082
Let me out!

Sophie? What's going on?
What happened?

[panting]

358
00:32:02,426 --> 00:32:04,928
Hey, hey. It's okay.

359
00:32:06,363 --> 00:32:07,397
What happened?

360
00:32:09,232 --> 00:32:10,634
What happened?

361
00:32:10,667 --> 00:32:13,136
Of course, her boyfriend comes
to her rescue.

00:32:16,606 --> 00:32:18,175
Do you think it's funny?

364
00:32:21,044 --> 00:32:22,079
[yells] Do you?

365
00:32:31,688 --> 00:32:34,858
It's okay. It's over.

366
00:32:37,694 --> 00:32:39,196
What happened in there?

367
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:41,932
You can tell me.

368
00:32:45,268 --> 00:32:46,870
-Nothing.
-[Kate] Sophie?

369
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,908
Why aren't you in class?

370
00:32:51,942 --> 00:32:53,510
Oh, this isn't her fault.

371
00:32:53,543 --> 00:32:55,212
The older girls
were playing some--

372
00:32:55,245 --> 00:32:56,446
I'm sorry, Mom.

373
00:32:58,281 --> 00:32:59,349
Excuse us.

374
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:01,918
[Maurice] Sure.

375
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:03,086
Are you all right?

376
00:33:19,002 --> 00:33:20,270
[Sister Irene] Sister Astrid?

377
00:33:20,303 --> 00:33:21,338
[Sister Astrid]
Welcome to Tarascon.

378
00:33:21,371 --> 00:33:23,673
Please come in.

379
00:33:23,707 --> 00:33:27,310
We still have mass,
but no one comes.

380
00:33:27,344 --> 00:33:29,679
People believe
it was the devil.

381
00:33:29,713 --> 00:33:34,418
They say our church is cursed,
that God has abandoned us.

382
00:33:48,532 --> 00:33:50,000
This is where we found him.

383
00:33:50,033 --> 00:33:52,002
[breath exhales]

384
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:56,706

389
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,140
[Sister Debra] Sister?

390
00:35:08,278 --> 00:35:09,412
Are you okay?

391
00:35:12,115 --> 00:35:13,149
I'm fine.

392
00:35:17,654 --> 00:35:19,656
[Sister Debra] Can we see
Father Noiret's room, please?

393
00:35:21,391 --> 00:35:22,459
[Sister Astrid] Of course.

394
00:35:31,468 --> 00:35:32,369
Creepy.

395
00:35:33,703 --> 00:35:35,105
[Sister Irene] Saint Lucy.

396
00:35:35,138 --> 00:35:37,207
Patron Saint of the blind.

397
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,642
She was murdered by pagans.

398
00:35:38,675 --> 00:35:40,644
They lit her on fire,
but she wouldn't burn.

399
00:35:40,677 --> 00:35:43,146
Before killing her,
they gouged out her eyes.

400
00:35:43,179 --> 00:35:44,581
[keys rattle]

401
00:35:44,614 --> 00:35:47,150
Found them. Please.

402
00:35:49,319 --> 00:35:50,620
[lock turns]

403
00:35:55,592 --> 00:35:57,594
[traffic rumbling outside]

404
00:36:00,163 --> 00:36:02,666
There was a boy that night?
A witness?

405
00:36:02,699 --> 00:36:05,302
Yes. Jacques.
He saw everything.

406
00:36:06,403 --> 00:36:07,771
Where can we find him?

407
00:36:07,805 --> 00:36:10,240
His mother doesn't want him
talking about it.

408
00:36:11,675 --> 00:36:14,644
But you might find him
playing football in town.

409
00:36:14,678 --> 00:36:16,746
Was there anyone else
in the church?

410
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,381
We had a handyman.

411
00:36:18,415 --> 00:36:20,517
He left the day
after it happened.

412
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:22,419
Do you know where he went?

413
00:36:22,452 --> 00:36:24,554
I don't know.

414
00:36:24,588 --> 00:36:28,191
But he was a world traveler.
He came from Romania.

415
00:36:28,224 --> 00:36:29,894
That is where he got
his nickname.

416
00:36:29,927 --> 00:36:32,429
They used to call him...

417
00:36:32,462 --> 00:36:33,831
-"Frenchie."
-Frenchie.

418
00:36:36,232 --> 00:36:37,835
[Sister Irene] Where are you
headed next?

419
00:36:37,868 --> 00:36:40,503
Well, I have enough money
to get me to Hungary,

420
00:36:40,537 --> 00:36:42,706
and from there,
the world is my oyster.

421
00:36:44,174 --> 00:36:46,176
At least Hungary is.

422
00:36:46,209 --> 00:36:49,379
-You saved my life.
-That? That was nothing.

423
00:36:49,412 --> 00:36:52,883
No, you've just fell into a...
what do you call it? Um...

424
00:36:52,917 --> 00:36:54,317
a life debt.

425
00:36:54,885 --> 00:36:56,586
It's very simple.

426
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:59,824
You and I will be bound
together for all eternity.

427
00:37:02,292 --> 00:37:03,526
[train whistle blows]

428
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,161
[conductor shouting]

429
00:37:05,195 --> 00:37:06,563
[Sister Irene] I almost forgot.

430
00:37:06,596 --> 00:37:09,432
It's nothing, just a thank you.

431
00:37:13,403 --> 00:37:15,806
Tomato seeds. Thank you.

432
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,208
You said you wanted a farm
some day.

433
00:37:18,241 --> 00:37:19,476
You have to start somewhere.

434
00:37:21,778 --> 00:37:24,614
-I'll miss you, Irene.
-[whistle blows]

435
00:37:24,648 --> 00:37:26,650
[conductor shouting]

436
00:37:39,562 --> 00:37:40,530
[Sister Debra] Irene?

437
00:37:42,532 --> 00:37:44,234
Who is this Frenchie guy?

438
00:37:46,302 --> 00:37:48,571
His name is Maurice.

439
00:37:48,605 --> 00:37:50,841
Back at Saint Carta,
he was our guide.

440
00:37:50,875 --> 00:37:55,211
When I faced the demon,
he came back for me.

441
00:37:58,281 --> 00:37:59,449
<i>He saved my life.</i>

442
00:38:02,252 --> 00:38:04,721
[gasps] That's when
it happened.

443
00:38:04,754 --> 00:38:06,756
[screams]

444
00:38:09,659 --> 00:38:11,962
It's how the demon escaped.

445
00:38:11,996 --> 00:38:15,265
That's how it's moving,
doing these things.

446
00:38:15,298 --> 00:38:17,500
So, he's... possessed.

447
00:38:20,603 --> 00:38:22,605
[indistinct shouting]

448
00:38:28,311 --> 00:38:28,979
[Kate] Maurice.

449
00:38:30,547 --> 00:38:32,749
Hi. Hello again.

450
00:38:34,484 --> 00:38:37,021
I realized
I never said thank you.

451
00:38:37,054 --> 00:38:39,622
-Sophie told me what you did.
-Oh. No.

452
00:38:39,656 --> 00:38:42,459
Those girls
are little monsters.

453
00:38:42,492 --> 00:38:45,595
They're not all bad. Just some.

454
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,871
Look... the chapel, why does
Madame keep it locked up?

455
00:38:53,904 --> 00:38:56,606
Uh, it's dangerous.

456
00:38:56,639 --> 00:38:59,442
Her son was killed inside
during the bombings.

457
00:39:00,811 --> 00:39:03,013
Cedric. He was an altar boy.

458
00:39:04,447 --> 00:39:06,050
I didn't know she had a son.

459
00:39:06,083 --> 00:39:07,885
She doesn't talk about it.

460
00:39:07,918 --> 00:39:11,822
Madame is a hard woman,
but she's been very good to us.

461
00:39:18,461 --> 00:39:21,631
Ah. I should get back
to the children.

462
00:39:21,664 --> 00:39:24,300
Sure, yes. And I should
get back to my work.

463
00:39:29,874 --> 00:39:31,842
[indistinct chatter]

464
00:39:45,022 --> 00:39:46,322
Caught you!

465
00:39:47,124 --> 00:39:49,392
What were you doing?

466
00:39:49,425 --> 00:39:51,795
-Nothing.
-You were spying.

467
00:39:53,496 --> 00:39:55,833
-Maybe.
-Maybe?

468
00:39:55,866 --> 00:39:58,635
Maybe, probably,
absolutely definitely.

469
00:39:58,668 --> 00:40:00,838
[Sophie chuckles]

470
00:40:00,871 --> 00:40:03,941
-What were you talking about?
-Nothing.

471
00:40:05,375 --> 00:40:07,744
It was something.
He was making you laugh.

472
00:40:08,946 --> 00:40:10,747
That is none of your business.

473
00:40:12,382 --> 00:40:15,518
Now, let's go. No more spying.

-I've been looking for you.
-Mom?

495
00:42:50,107 --> 00:42:50,975
[Kate] Quick.

496
00:42:54,144 --> 00:42:57,014
What's next?
Is this just a big dead end?

497
00:42:58,849 --> 00:43:00,750
No. There's something here.

498
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:06,589
What? You...
You sense something?

499
00:43:08,258 --> 00:43:09,492
Something like that.

500
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:11,962

Hm. I'm afraid I can't find it.

What? That's not possible.
I have a reservation.

Madam, it's not here.

I had a vision.
I saw what the demon wants.

605
00:56:25,755 --> 00:56:28,358
It's powerful.

606
00:56:28,391 --> 00:56:31,294
Some coveted prize,
some ancient relic.

607

It's going to kill him
when it's done.

612
00:56:55,585 --> 00:56:58,022
The altar boy.

613
00:56:58,055 --> 00:57:00,523
I-I forgot to tell you,
I found him.

614
00:57:00,557 --> 00:57:02,525
-What?
-Well, he found me.

615
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:05,062
He came by when you were out.
He gave me this.

616
00:57:16,739 --> 00:57:17,975
Father Noiret's rosary.

617
00:57:21,544 --> 00:57:22,947
The symbol, it...

618
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:27,450
it seems so familiar,
but I can't place it.

619
00:57:27,483 --> 00:57:29,452
I can. The photos.

620
00:57:33,824 --> 00:57:35,692
I think I saw that
on one of the victims.

Look.

622
00:57:38,128 --> 00:57:39,596
It's a connection.

If we find out what this means,

624
00:57:49,106 --> 00:57:50,941
we might be able to find out
where it's headed.

I don't know why
she went in there last night.

There's something wrong
with this school.

There's something
that doesn't feel right.

there's something here...

N-no.

It's just a feeling.

Hey, it's okay to be scared.

655
01:01:13,911 --> 01:01:16,046

She's always worried.

Don't know why.
Maybe she loves you?

I've been speaking
to the Vatican.

01:02:35,893 --> 01:02:38,862
They tell me the demon
of Saint Carta has returned.

It's a family crest.

01:02:46,370 --> 01:02:49,306
Saint Lucy of Syracuse.

Saint Lucy?

680
01:02:59,983 --> 01:03:01,318
I think I know what it wants.

What?

682
01:03:05,788 --> 01:03:07,257
The eyes.

683

The eyes? W-What eyes?

684
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:13,864
When Lucy was murdered
by pagans, her family escaped.

685
01:03:13,897 --> 01:03:15,165
They were hunted.

686
01:03:17,834 --> 01:03:19,436
Scattered across the globe.

687
01:03:19,469 --> 01:03:22,172
All this time, they've been
protecting a secret.

688
01:03:22,206 --> 01:03:23,240
A holy relic.

689
01:03:24,408 --> 01:03:26,343
The eyes of Saint Lucy.

690
01:03:29,213 --> 01:03:34,952
So, the demon
is after a... pair of eyes?

691
01:03:34,985 --> 01:03:38,488
-Why would it want that?
-It's a demon.

I'm just a glorified librarian,
I couldn't begin to guess.

But, if we're
sharing theories...

694
01:03:47,297 --> 01:03:52,202
you might like to consider that
this demon was once an angel.

695
01:03:56,206 --> 01:03:57,474
Rejected by God.

697
01:04:00,310 --> 01:04:03,046
that God so casually
gave to His saints.

698
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:04,982
It wants that power back.

[librarian]
Demons are infinite.

700
01:04:06,883 --> 01:04:08,352
It was there with Saint Lucy

701
01:04:08,385 --> 01:04:11,021
and it's been hunting
the bloodline ever since.

702
01:04:11,054 --> 01:04:14,157
This relic is an item
of great power.

703
01:04:14,191 --> 01:04:17,194
In the hands of a demon,
it would be unthinkable.

704
01:04:17,227 --> 01:04:19,863
But in your hands,
it could be a weapon.

705
01:04:19,896 --> 01:04:23,333
Just as you used the blood
of Christ at Saint Carta.

706
01:04:23,367 --> 01:04:25,035
This is the way you do it.

707
01:04:26,837 --> 01:04:30,874
This is the way you send
that thing back to hell.

708
01:04:34,478 --> 01:04:36,013
We just don't know where it is.

709
01:04:38,048 --> 01:04:38,949

According to letters
that he wrote to the Vatican,

We don't really know
what this relic can do.

725
01:05:34,504 --> 01:05:36,606
The same goes for the demon.

726
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:39,009
<i>It will take any form,</i>

727
01:05:39,042 --> 01:05:42,212

<i>to prey on your fears,</i>

728
01:05:42,245 --> 01:05:44,948

-It's called feijoada.

-It's a Portuguese stew.
-What's in it?

732
01:06:09,072 --> 01:06:10,073
Slugs.

733
01:06:11,675 --> 01:06:12,876
And snails.

734
01:06:26,089 --> 01:06:27,057
I lied to you.

735
01:06:28,392 --> 01:06:29,693
About what?

736
01:06:29,726 --> 01:06:31,595
I said I didn't remember
my mother.

737
01:06:33,530 --> 01:06:34,531
But I do.

738
01:06:37,467 --> 01:06:39,269
I remember everything
about her.

739
01:06:40,971 --> 01:06:43,473
<i>She was deeply religious.</i>

740
01:06:43,507 --> 01:06:45,709
<i>She said that God</i>
<i>spoke directly to her,</i>

741
01:06:45,742 --> 01:06:47,611
<i>that He showed her things.</i>

01:06:50,347 --> 01:06:51,214

744
01:06:52,516 --> 01:06:54,551
My father didn't believe her.

745
01:06:54,584 --> 01:06:56,153
He said she was insane.

746
01:06:58,221 --> 01:06:59,356
Heretical.

747
01:06:59,389 --> 01:07:01,024
What happened to her?

748
01:07:02,292 --> 01:07:04,127
My father brought her
to a doctor.

749
01:07:06,263 --> 01:07:08,198
Then they came back
and took her away.
