00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:44,938
<i>What should one know
about the kind of fear</i>

7
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:48,108
<i>caused by the sound
of aeroplanes and bombs?</i>

8
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:51,153
<i>One usually feels
a certain anguish and fear</i>

9
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:53,363
<i>at the droning sound
of aeroplanes</i>

10
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,699
<i>or the ghostly noises
of bombs falling.</i>

11
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:58,285
<i>By becoming familiar
with the sound of aeroplanes</i>

12
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:03,165
<i>and with the expectation of bombs
one can be relieved of such fear.</i>

13
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:05,417
<i>In flight,
a plane makes a loud booming sound</i>

14
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:07,377
<i>but one can't accurately guess</i>

15
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:10,672
<i>the number of aeroplanes
merely from the strength of the sound.</i>

16
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:13,550
<i>Other circumstances
can be misleading.</i>

17
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:16,803
<i>A low-flying plane can mislead one
into thinking it's a flight formation.</i>

18
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:19,973
<i>The clouds and wind
can have the same effect.</i>

19
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:23,769
<i>One can recognize types of aeroplane
by their engine sounds,</i>

20
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:26,605
<i>but one would need
considerable practice to do so.</i>

21
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,899
<i>Thus, one rarely
has reliable information</i>

22
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,859
<i>about the type of plane flying</i>

23
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:36,073
<i>when based on simple human hearing,
especially without sufficient practice.</i>

24
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:39,034
<i>The sound of falling bombs
is unpleasant for most.</i>

25
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:41,036
<i>Yet what is it really?</i>

26
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:44,122
<i>Bombs, when released,
accelerate towards the earth,</i>

27
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:49,378
<i>causing such a sound effect.</i>

28
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:51,338
<i>We saw a fine match</i>

29
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,674
<i>between the Hungarian
and German Army teams.</i>

30
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:56,426
<i>A number of Austrian players
are among the German team</i>

31
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:59,137
<i>playing against
the Hungarian soldiers.</i>

32
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:03,225
<i>The spirited match
ended in a 2:2 draw.</i>

33
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:02,367
Let go of me!

34
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:04,828
You can't go home.
They're searching your flat.

35
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,913
Your husband
had to disappear.

36
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:11,460
- Why?
- Please don't ask stupid questions.

37
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:18,258
Have you anywhere to stay tonight?
At the other end of town?

38
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:21,136
- With whom?
- You can't go home.

39
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:24,347
You know of your husband's
contacts in the movement, don't you?

40
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:28,810
- No, I don't know.
- Good. That was a good answer.

41
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:33,023
From now on you must always answer
everybody like this. Understand?

42
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,817
What if I had come
from the other end of the road?

43
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:39,321
We were expecting you.
So you won't let the cat out of the bag.

44
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:43,158
What cat? I can't make head
or tail out of what you're saying.

45
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:48,872
Anything might give him <i>away.</i>
So where can you go?

46
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:54,419
I don't know. I don't know.
Nowhere.

47
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:59,466
Then go to St. Ferenc Hospital
in an hour's time.

48
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:03,345
21, Széher St. Find Dr. Czakó
in the surgical department.

49
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:16,316
You're a refugee from Erdély and
have been hiding at a relative's place.

50
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,027
Your little girl
is in the country, for safety.

51
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,196
You're awaiting news
from your husband.

52
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,490
That's why you arrived here today.

53
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:26,493
Your address: Erdősor Rd.
5, Ujpest.

54
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:29,496
Your name: Mrs. János Biró,
née Katalin Simó.

55
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:33,875
You were born in Kolozsvár,
parents deceased. You're 29.

56
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:36,962
Your husband, János Biró, is 38,
chemical research worker.

57
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:39,130
- The child's name is Judit.
- Judit?

58
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:43,301
When you've memorized that, you'" go
downtown. Take a tram at West Station.

59
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:46,221
Don't ask anyone any questions,
I've drawn you a map.

60
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:49,808
It's a one-story house,
brick facade, you can't miss it.

61
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:53,395
- You ring the bell.
- What do I say? Who am I looking for?

62
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,856
- Your husband will open the door.
- My husband?

63
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:59,943
Yes, János Biró, and you'll say,
"Thank God, the child's all right."

64
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:03,280
That's the first thing you'll <i>say,</i>
"Thank God, the child's all right."

65
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,615
- Do you have any children?
- A little girl. She's 5.

66
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,659
We sent her to my mother's. Judit.

67
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:10,161
I don't know how she is,
there've been no letters for two weeks.

68
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:13,498
You say, "Thank God, the
child's all right." Please repeat it.

69
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:16,084
Thank God the child's all right...

70
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:20,213
- Will you tell my husband where I am?
- Of course.

71
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:23,341
You must face reality.
You won't be alone.

72
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:27,220
- Exercise a little self-control.
- When will I get news of my husband?

73
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:29,306
- As soon as possible.
- Where he is staying...?

74
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,641
If I'm right, you know how to draw.

75
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,935
-I studied industrial drawing.
- Very good.

76
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:36,229
Now I'll leave you to study it.

77
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:38,356
Please give me all the papers
you have on you,

78
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,734
as well as any family photographs.

79
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:44,279
It wouldn't do to have them
find them on you.

80
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,615
Here you are.

81
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:33,036
Katalin Simó, I'm Katalin Simó,
not Sikó, not Sivó, but Simó.

82
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:39,334
Katalin Simó. I was born in 1915,
11 December, in Koloz...

83
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,628
Kolozsvár, my God...

84
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:47,342
My name is Mrs. János Biró,
née Katalin Simó,

85
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:51,012
born in Kolozsvár,
11 December 1915.

86
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:56,184
Excuse me, some clothes.

87
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:02,565
My name is Mrs. János Biró,
János Biró.

88
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:05,235
I am Mrs. János Biró,
Mrs. János Biró.

89
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:09,447
I am Katalin Simó,
born 11 December 1915.

90
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:13,034
My daughter Judit was born
in February 1938.

91
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:18,373
My mother's name...
I can't memorize this. Erzsébet Farkas.

92
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:24,421
My father, György Simó,
Erzsébet Farkas.

93
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,608
Please go down
to the X-ray department at once.

94
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:48,695
I have to give an explanation
to the people working here.

95
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,409
- Mrs. János Biró?
- Yes.

96
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:57,954
- Maiden name?
- Katalin Simó.

97
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:02,250
- Born?
- 11 December 1915 in Kolozsvár.

98
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,517
The child?

99
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:03,228
Thank God the child is all right.

100
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:10,318
- Everything is all right?
- Yes. Thank God the child is all right.

101
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:13,113
Well, you've come at last,
my dear.

102
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:15,240
My husband has been
waiting for you impatiently.

103
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,408
You must be tired and hungry.

104
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:20,495
A hot bath will do you good.
What should I call you, dear?

105
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:23,456
- Katalin.
- My husband should be here soon.

106
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,542
We could all eat together.

107
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:40,598
This is our room. It used to be their
son's but he's on the front line now.

108
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:43,434
His fiancée lives in the next street
and often comes over.

109
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:48,189
She's very inquisitive about their room.
She's a bit of a Nazi sympathizer.

110
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:50,608
- So don't have long chats with her.
- Yes.

111
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:54,612
The door opens out onto the courtyard.
This is the bathroom door.

112
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:57,490
There's another door
where the old people are.

113
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:59,742
Living room and kitchen
in one and a bathroom.

114
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:02,871
We could go through there too
but it's better we go via the yard.

115
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:07,542
This wall is adjacent
with the old people's room.

116
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:12,547
Honest working people but best
not to talk in front of them either.

117
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,716
By the way, welcome.

118
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:21,931
I suppose you know
what's most important.

119
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:26,227
Yes. Mrs. János Biró,
née Katalin Simó, in Kolozsvár,

120
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:28,354
11 December 1915.

121
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:31,774
It's just as well
that my real name is Katalin too.

122
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:35,403
I am sure you must have
some news of my husband.

123
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:43,119
It's better for both of us if we know
as little as possible about each other.

124
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:46,497
<i>But I suppose
they must have tom you that.</i>

125
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:51,169
Did they send
any messages with you?

126
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,295
No.

127
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:55,882
Then, I'll wait. You cannot leave
the house without my permission.

128
00:11:55,965 --> 00:12:00,011
But I simply must know
what's happened to my husband.

129
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:02,430
We didn't know a thing this morning.

130
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:05,975
I must look around the flat,
perhaps he's left a note for me.

131
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,353
I'll only go after dark.
I'll use the back stairs,

132
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:11,064
through the surgery.
My husband's a doctor.

133
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:13,441
You're not going anywhere.
I don't know who you are

134
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:16,736
or why they've sent you here
but I accept your presence as a fact

135
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:21,241
and you must do the <i>same.</i>
Try and accept the circumstances.

136
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:25,453
From here to there is yours.
Why don't you unpack?

137
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:29,707
I shan't bother you if I don't have to.
I'll get some firewood.

138
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:47,350
May I see your papers?
I just want to see what they're like.

139
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:52,021
Will you test me?

140
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:35,606
The water should be
warm enough soon.

141
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:39,694
- This isn't exactly the Hotel des
Bains! - I was given the suitcase too.

142
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:43,948
I'm sorry, but we must behave
naturally because of the old folk.

143
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:47,577
I'll act natural.

144
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:03,593
Hurry up.
We've been invited for dinner.

145
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,678
Yes.

146
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:38,503
You're still young.
Three times I've lived through this,

147
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:41,631
people rendered homeless
because of politics.

148
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,591
Half the country are refugees

149
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:47,762
while the other half
either chase them or lie low and wait.

150
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,889
Your soup will get cold,
you talk too much.

151
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,016
One should be happy
with what one can.

152
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:56,396
Be happy that your belly's full,
that the young lady has arrived

153
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:58,815
and that the child is all right.

154
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,942
I haven't even asked you,
what's her name?

155
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:04,445
Judit. She's got lovely long hair.

156
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:08,116
- The main thing is that she's safe.
- Yes, that's the main thing.

157
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:12,036
I only wish mine was that old,
he'd be out of this horror.

158
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:27,593
You did guite well!
But you shouldn't go into details.

159
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,929
What details?

160
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:34,767
I might have said that
the child's hair is blonde and short.

161
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:37,603
Don't tell anyone anything,
it's none of their business.

162
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:40,481
Such small details
can lead to great danger.

163
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:44,152
Every word you utter might offer
essential proof to the informer.

164
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:46,737
- But they're sheltering us.
- They're not.

165
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:51,993
They're workers who rent their rooms
to refugees from Erdély for money.

166
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:56,456
They have nothing to do with us,
but with their neighbours they do.

167
00:15:57,582 --> 00:16:01,085
That semi-Nazi girl
is almost their daughter-in-law.

168
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:04,797
Everything you do or say must be
with a possible informant in mind.

169
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:08,843
Don't leave anything lying around,
don't write anything down.

170
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:11,429
Don't give any details of yourself.

171
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,683
And so on...

172
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:23,274
You can turn in now.
I'll go out till you're ready.

173
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:41,876
Did you sleep well?
Did you count all the corners?

174
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,836
I'm sorry.

175
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,423
I waited with the breakfast
till you woke but I'm hungry now.

176
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:50,051
Did I sleep that long?
Forgive me.

177
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,762
Doesn't matter. You were tired.

178
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:58,976
How can I get news of my husband?
Maybe he doesn't know where I am.

179
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:03,189
He'll find you when the time is ripe.

180
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:09,028
Hurry, my dear.
They're selling potatoes two streets up.

181
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,822
5 kg per person,
there's hardly any left already.

182
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:14,033
- Where?
- As you go out, on your left.

183
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:47,400
We discussed it yesterday.
You can't go out without my permission.

184
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:52,154
And you queue with all the women
of the neighbourhood in this.

185
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:54,323
- It's only a nurse's cloak.
- Dead right it is.

186
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,825
But you look nothing like a nurse.

187
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,703
The clothes aren't hers,
how did she get them?

188
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:02,748
Why can't you understand,
everything has significance?

189
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:06,002
Your face, your hairstyle, your dress.
They tie their scarves differently here.

190
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,170
- What do you mean by all this?
- Nothing.

191
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:11,549
I'm just warning you
that this could cost us our lives.

192
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:14,010
This is not the medical school ball.

193
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:23,185
Tell me, are you sure
you haven't got any papers

194
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:26,022
or photographs still on you
which might be dangerous,

195
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:30,067
- a memento which is identifiable?
- No, I have nothing.

196
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,281
Will you please empty your bag?

197
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:53,007
Your husband?

198
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:57,011
I know that I mustn't answer now,
so let's say my brother, all right?

199
00:18:57,094 --> 00:19:01,265
Burn it, you should have done
it yesterday when you came here.

200
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,894
And this too.

201
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,897
Please, this is the only photo
I have of my little girl.

202
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:12,401
Why can't this be our little girl? After
all we have a little girl too. Judit.

203
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:15,029
Have you got any children?

204
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:18,032
I beg you, don't burn this picture,
not this one.

205
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:23,120
- You can burn the other one.
- All right, this is our child.

206
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:25,456
As for the other one, burn it.

207
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,109
- Give it to me.
- Do you have children?

208
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,278
- Yes, Judit. Thank God she's all right.
- I'm being serious.

209
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,406
At least answer me this one question.

210
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:02,743
- Thank God the child is all right. -I
want to know if you have any children.

211
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:04,704
I have.

212
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:20,052
Please help me
get news of my daughter.

213
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:22,972
- At least of her! Please.
- Then, you tell me how.

214
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:28,144
If only my husband were here.

215
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:35,192
Wake up! Where's your husband?

216
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:38,154
My husband?
You're my husband, János Biró.

217
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,656
I'm Mrs. János Biró, Katalin Simó.

218
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,825
Don't talk rubbish.
Where's your husband?

219
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,994
Here. I'm Mrs. János Biró.

220
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,543
All right. Go back to sleep!

221
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,677
Good morning.

222
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:07,475
Why did you do
that horrible thing in the night?

223
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:10,186
What?

224
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:15,983
Look, we are both in a dark forest.

225
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:20,905
That's why I have to know
if I can let you walk behind me.

226
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:24,241
If I don't trust you,
you can't come with me on patrol.

227
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:27,453
I'd kill you the moment
I notice the slightest suspicion.

228
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:33,918
I'll kill you so you can't kill me.
Do you understand?

229
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:38,839
I keep dreaming about my son.

230
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:42,885
He comes through the gate
and stands by this door

231
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:46,096
and I shake in fear
in case someone has seen him here

232
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:49,517
because then they'll know
that he deserted.

233
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,979
He stands there a while,
looks through the window and leaves.

234
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:58,984
And then I'm relieved and wake up.
Why do I dream this?

235
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:02,571
My husband is restless too
in the night, he wakes up.

236
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:07,117
Then I wake up too. It took me
a while to go back to sleep last night.

237
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:24,009
The old woman told me you've been
complaining that I'm restless at night,

238
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:28,472
that I wake up and wake you up too.
What's the good of telling you?

239
00:22:28,556 --> 00:22:30,891
What's that got to do with
the old woman and her neighbours

240
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:33,435
and via them
God knows who else, how I sleep?

241
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:38,357
My underwear is in front of you.
Are you going to tell her about it too?

242
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,026
What they're like,
how often I change them?

243
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:44,989
If I disturb you in your sleep,
perhaps I snore,

244
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:49,201
though you'd be the first one
to say so, rather than wake me up.

245
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:51,453
Tell me not to, give me a nudge.

246
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:55,082
And another thing.

247
00:22:57,501 --> 00:23:00,629
The old woman tells me everything.

248
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:04,925
She feels that I belong
to them a little by now.

249
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:08,929
Whatever you say to her,
you can count as a message to me.

250
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:11,140
I'm sorry.

251
00:23:13,267 --> 00:23:15,519
My wife told me you dream
of your son a lot.

252
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:18,480
- What did she say?
- The things you dream of, Aunty Irma.

253
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:22,401
One talks a lot of nonsense...
we were cleaning peas.

254
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:26,322
- Leave it, I'll chop those logs up.
- I'll have it done in a second.

255
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:27,174
Come quickly. Can't you
understand? Don't loiter here.

256
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:41,313
<i>How long has he been there?
Who is he observing?</i>

257
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:44,817
<i>I've seen him before.
How long has he been watching us?</i>

258
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:47,528
<i>He was following us a while back,
yet no one was behind us.</i>

259
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:50,406
<i>This one's popped up
out of the blue...</i>

260
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:00,749
<i>If I turn around suddenly,
maybe he isn't even there.</i>

261
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:03,794
<i>I mustn't turn around,
he's not coming.</i>

262
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:07,756
<i>That's all right. He was simply
waiting for someone, what a joke.</i>

263
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:12,011
<i>He was just a pedestrian,
you're beginning to see things.</i>

264
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:43,083
I was thirsty.

265
00:25:53,844 --> 00:25:56,013
Don't I know you
from way back?

266
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:58,724
I don't know,
I don't remember you.

267
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:01,393
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

268
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:08,150
Tell me, would you at least
help me get news of my husband?

269
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:39,473
There's a lieutenant looking for you.

270
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:44,436
- My husband's not at home.
- I told him but he said he'll wait.

271
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,856
- Pali Szilasi.
- Good day, lieutenant. Mrs. János Biró.

272
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,942
I'm looking for your husband.

273
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:53,612
I've known him for a long time
but we lost touch a while back.

274
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:56,782
We live in such an age, lieutenant.
People lose touch.

275
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:59,076
These are terrible times,
but it'" soon be over.

276
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,453
It can't last much longer now.

277
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:03,747
- When will your husband be home?
- I don't know.

278
00:27:03,831 --> 00:27:08,752
Your husband's a wonderful <i>man,</i>
I've known him since I was a kid.

279
00:27:08,836 --> 00:27:13,048
- I learnt a lot from him.
- Yes. My husband is very attractive.

280
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:16,260
You're a lucky woman,
but he is even luckier with you.

281
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:18,220
That's very kind of you.

282
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:21,098
The lieutenant has been waiting
for you for a while.

283
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:24,393
I'm sure he wouldn't say
no to a cup of tea.

284
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,860
The lieutenant is very smart.
Isn't it a bit risky?

285
00:27:32,943 --> 00:27:36,196
This is my safety,
people respect uniform religiously,

286
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,615
and the women go crazy about it.

287
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:52,504
I don't know where János
has been hiding you.

288
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:56,592
It takes a war to enable me
to court my best friend's wife.

289
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,927
So far,
I've only seen a photo of you.

290
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:02,514
- Where?
- János showed me one a long time ago.

291
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:05,934
I can just imagine
what sort of photo that was.

292
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:07,895
All photos of me were terrible.

293
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:10,189
I couldn't have recognized
you by them.

294
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:12,482
- I think you have to go.
- Yes.

295
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:17,696
- When will we see you again?
- When he can come.

296
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,427
He's forgotten...

297
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:44,556
He didn't forget it,
he's the one we've been waiting for.

298
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,642
But you were faultless.

299
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:51,396
Another exam?
And were you both satisfied?

300
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:54,733
It must have been entertaining.

301
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:58,779
Or perhaps
you're afraid of me too?

302
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:04,618
Where have you been
the last few years?

303
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:07,663
Or now on 15 October,
or yesterday,

304
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:11,250
that you don't wonder
about anything or anyone?

305
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:15,420
I don't know what's in your head,
but as far as I'm concerned

306
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:20,050
there's no place left for innocence
and naivety in my life.

307
00:29:20,217 --> 00:29:23,637
Our only chance is to be prepared
to face any and every betrayal.

308
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,266
- Is that the way you like it?
- What?

309
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:36,775
Did you have a quarrel?
Don't cry.

310
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:39,486
I see you're both so tight-lipped.

311
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:41,780
That's worse
than shouting at each other.

312
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:45,951
Are you worried about the little girl?
Everyone is worried.

313
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:06,847
- Why are you crying?
- Oh, my God, why?

314
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:11,393
I don't know what's happening to
my child, or where my husband is.

315
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,740
"You're not alone!"

316
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:14,915
- Do you know this writing?
- Yes, it's my husband's.

317
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:16,917
"Darling, I'm safe.
I'll come for you soon.

318
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,336
"It hurts me too
that we had to part so suddenly..."

319
00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:26,051
Thank you,
you're a good man after all.

320
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,931
Well, now we must burn this.

321
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:38,939
Be careful, your husband's
got someone, I know.

322
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:41,108
No, it's not true...

323
00:31:48,198 --> 00:31:52,661
Come on, quieten down, wake up.

324
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:56,415
Calm down, you've been
shouting in your sleep.

325
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:58,583
Would you like some water?

326
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:18,186
Calm down now.
Lie back and go back to sleep.

327
00:32:20,981 --> 00:32:24,985
Tamás... Tamás...

328
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:39,499
- There you are.
- Thank you.

329
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:19,831
That blonde lady next
to the window sent you this.

330
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:28,632
"It seems
human cowardice has no limits"

331
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:34,471
- Aren't you feeling well?
- I'm sorry.

332
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:39,309
Don't you recognize me?
It must be my hair. I dyed it blonde.

333
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:43,063
But I thought that this way
I won't look so obviously...

334
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:44,940
It suits you.

335
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:49,152
You cannot stay anywhere for long.
After a while you have to escape again.

336
00:33:49,236 --> 00:33:53,740
Just one night, could I come
to your place, just for a night.

337
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:56,910
I can't go on looking for a place.
I don't want to die like a dog.

338
00:33:56,993 --> 00:34:00,664
I'm sorry, but you must have got
me mixed up with someone else.

339
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:05,252
Of course, I haven't seen you
since I got my nose fixed.

340
00:34:05,335 --> 00:34:08,046
But don't you really recognize me?

341
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:11,675
I know that my face looks different
with this nose.

342
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:14,761
Two years ago, I thought
it might save my life.

343
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:16,888
What's your name?

344
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:20,850
Bözsi. Don't you remember?
I sat next to the window in form 2.

345
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:22,811
Bözsi what?!

346
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:27,566
No, you don't want
to recognize me.

347
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:30,360
What Bözsi?!

348
00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:34,990
She's guite clever, having her face
changed. Now let's hear her name.

349
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:40,328
Deutsch? Löblin? Maisler? Wippler?
Ehrlich? Bettelsheim? Sonnenschein?

350
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:46,001
I'm Bözsi Tóth
and you go and fuck yourself.

351
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:52,591
You can all go and fuck yourselves.
<i>Base,</i> coward pretenders.

352
00:34:52,674 --> 00:34:56,720
I hope God will treat you
the way you are treating us!

353
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:02,100
And I hope your children
will despise you!

354
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,307
Why are you crying?
What's happened?

355
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:45,393
- Where were you?
- I was busy.

356
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,646
Who was that woman
who followed you to the toilet?

357
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:49,314
She's in hiding
and has nowhere to sleep.

358
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:51,900
- Do you know her?
- No.

359
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:55,070
She said she was a schoolfriend
but I can't remember her.

360
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:58,948
- Are you sure? You've never seen her?
- I don't know.

361
00:35:59,032 --> 00:36:02,369
- And the man who spoke to you?
- Nobody spoke to me at all.

362
00:36:02,452 --> 00:36:05,455
- Why did you start running away?
- I don't know.

363
00:36:05,622 --> 00:36:08,375
They why did you turn around.
Who were you waiting for?

364
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:12,671
- I didn't know what happened to you.
- You got a scare.

365
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:14,631
- Yes.
- Why?

366
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:17,634
From where do you know
that man I was with?

367
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:20,637
- I don't know him.
- You've never seen him before?

368
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:25,809
No. I did a Red Cross
nursing course last year.

369
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:30,355
My husband insisted on it
and there, one sees so many people...

370
00:36:32,232 --> 00:36:34,442
Maybe...

371
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:37,904
That woman begged me
to put her up for the night.

372
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:40,490
She could have come here.
There are three beds.

373
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:43,785
- What did you say to her?
-I don't know. It was dreadful.

374
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:47,455
- Keep your voice down.
- I told her I couldn't help.

375
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,708
- Good.
- Her life was at stake.

376
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:52,752
- We can't risk anything now.
- I can't bear this.

377
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:54,921
- Who do you think I am?
- Ouiet!

378
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:58,049
You treat me like a child
not to be trusted,

379
00:36:58,133 --> 00:37:01,177
that I don't need to know anything
because I can't understand.

380
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:05,849
And if I ask too many questions,
you must smack me like a child?!

381
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:24,534
- Who is it?
- It's me. There's a raid.

382
00:37:24,701 --> 00:37:28,788
They've closed off the whole area.
They're looking for someone.

383
00:37:28,872 --> 00:37:31,291
In the whole street, the gardens too.

384
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:33,752
Did you see anyone?
Did anyone come here?

385
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:37,172
Then they're searching in vain.
Go back to bed.

386
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:56,232
Keep your thoughts on the fact
that we're refugees from Erdély

387
00:37:56,316 --> 00:37:58,485
and nobody can be looking for us.

388
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:03,281
Our papers are in order and it would
just be an unpleasant formality.

389
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:05,825
- Did you hear what I said?
- Yes.

390
00:38:12,332 --> 00:38:19,964
- I think I am terribly afraid.
- So am I, it's natural.

391
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:31,601
But at least
we can be afraid together.

392
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:45,573
That's it, they've caught him.

393
00:38:49,536 --> 00:38:54,123
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I think so.

394
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,044
Thank God!

395
00:39:03,258 --> 00:39:05,885
We've escaped this time.

396
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:11,558
You're happy
because you've escaped.

397
00:39:43,006 --> 00:39:45,300
I'm sorry.

398
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:24,255
- Nice.
- The room's brighter this way.

399
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:26,925
I think the cupboard
was better against that wall.

400
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:30,136
It was a good sound barrier
between the old folk and us.

401
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:33,848
We should keep our voices
down in any case.

402
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:39,646
What are you looking at?
My hair looks awful.

403
00:40:39,729 --> 00:40:41,940
It's beautiful.

404
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:45,026
Beautiful you say?
Well, what do you know?!

405
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:50,448
I look dreadful in these clothes. I like
nice clothes. It's a joke, isn't it?

406
00:40:55,078 --> 00:41:00,750
We are both full of complexes.
But I like my complexes.

407
00:41:00,917 --> 00:41:03,503
I feel quite comfortable with them.

408
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,972
What a fool I am!

409
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:42,286
I am married.

410
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:57,802
Yes, yes.
I want you too, believe me.

411
00:45:33,022 --> 00:45:36,692
<i>My first lover!
I've got a lover!</i>

412
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:57,838
Good morning.
How did you sleep?

413
00:45:57,922 --> 00:46:00,925
- And you?
- Very well.

414
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:10,059
- What did you dream about?
- I can't remember.

415
00:46:10,226 --> 00:46:14,397
You must have been facing the window,
that's why you don't remember.

416
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:19,485
Breakfast is ready. Shall I bring yours
here, or would you rather come out?

417
00:46:21,529 --> 00:46:23,781
Good morning.

418
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:37,211
Sit down.
I haven't had breakfast yet either.

419
00:46:37,295 --> 00:46:40,298
I like having my tea standing up.

420
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:54,103
Do you want to take back
what you've done?

421
00:46:57,315 --> 00:47:00,985
If you don't want to remember
last night you needn't.

422
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:09,744
Last night was beautiful.
Thank you.

423
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:17,084
I love stroking your hand.
Is that enough?

424
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:20,629
No, but I can't explain
why it's not enough.

425
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:27,094
- Why did you clench your fist?
- No reason. Instinct.

426
00:47:28,137 --> 00:47:32,099
You're a coward.
You're more of a coward than I am.

427
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:37,938
- I've decided not to kiss you.
- Why?

428
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:42,818
I don't know, it's just that
I can see myself from the outside.

429
00:47:42,902 --> 00:47:45,446
Who can see you constantly
the way you see yourself?

430
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:47,615
You can.

431
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:49,575
Really?

432
00:47:52,161 --> 00:47:55,873
Do I look at you like that? I've come
to love you, do you believe me?

433
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:59,085
<i>Why should I believe her?
She just wants to be certain</i>

434
00:47:59,168 --> 00:48:02,380
<i>that she's attached me to herself,
to make me give myself up.</i>

435
00:48:02,463 --> 00:48:04,924
<i>Doesn't the fact that
we made love mean anything to you?</i>

436
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:11,180
- You're going too fast.
- Really? Sorry.

437
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:18,687
Attention!

438
00:48:28,531 --> 00:48:31,575
Turn away, they're filming us.
Damn it, where's that Pali?

439
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:41,419
They are filming us.

440
00:48:41,502 --> 00:48:44,004
And action!

441
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:49,510
- My respects, madam.
- Watch out, they're filming.

442
00:48:50,845 --> 00:48:53,389
Probably for the Wochenschau.

443
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:55,641
"Happy interlude
on the Hungarian theater of war".

444
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:58,811
You'd have looked great.
Young lovers defying hard times.

445
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:00,938
The Gestapo
would have loved that film.

446
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:04,775
I'd have been a hit as the young
allied officer. You have a letter.

447
00:49:04,859 --> 00:49:07,695
- From who?
- Your wife.

448
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:14,785
- Are these the ones?
- Get the hell out of here.

449
00:49:14,869 --> 00:49:18,664
Take my arm and don't look back.

450
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:24,128
Go down the street
and buy something, anything.

451
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:27,423
I'll meet you at the tram stop.
Go home if I'm not there.

452
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:30,634
Be sure you're not being followed.
If you are, try to lose them.

453
00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:33,846
There are houses with
passageways by the East Station.

454
00:49:40,436 --> 00:49:43,898
Christmas trees!

455
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:47,985
Christmas is the feast of love!
Buy your Christmas trees now.

456
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:51,530
- What would you like?
- Some paper and envelopes.

457
00:51:07,815 --> 00:51:10,943
I was waiting for my husband
by the Christmas tree seller.

458
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:14,363
Hoffmann. I am so glad
to make your acquaintance too.

459
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:18,617
We studied chemistry
together in Duisburg.

460
00:51:18,701 --> 00:51:21,870
He disappeared in '33.
I haven't heard of him since,

461
00:51:21,954 --> 00:51:25,916
and suddenly here he is.
Shall we go and sit down somewhere?

462
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,878
- We have a prior engagement.
-I am free all day.

463
00:51:29,962 --> 00:51:32,339
- We can't make it today.
- Do you live nearby?

464
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:36,760
- No, the other end of town.
- I'd like to see you one evening.

465
00:51:36,844 --> 00:51:39,305
It would be good to have a quiet chat.

466
00:51:39,388 --> 00:51:42,266
I haven't been able to put
two normal words together

467
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:45,936
ever since this thing started.

468
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:48,647
One doesn't talk too much
these days.

469
00:51:48,731 --> 00:51:52,735
Would you have thought in '31
that this would come to pass?

470
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:57,740
At times I think,
"God why have you forsaken us?"

471
00:51:57,865 --> 00:51:59,700
It's laughable isn't it?

472
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:02,620
I was overwhelmed with joy
when I saw your husband.

473
00:52:02,703 --> 00:52:07,207
There's a woman queuing up
by the bakery, officer.

474
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:11,879
She has no right to be on the streets.
They had a pharmacy.

475
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:19,303
Have her taken away. There she is,
a fugitive, in a blue coat.

476
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:23,015
Leave me alone, call a policeman.

477
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:25,559
What do you say
to the world we live in.

478
00:52:25,643 --> 00:52:30,105
What have we got to do
with these things?

479
00:52:30,189 --> 00:52:33,692
Let me write down
your address quickly.

480
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:37,446
Szív utca <i>5</i> in the center of town.

481
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:43,369
- Day after tomorrow, in the evening.
- We'll be expecting you.

482
00:52:43,452 --> 00:52:48,749
- This is Lotte, my wife.
- We've got a daughter, Judit.

483
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:51,752
Well, see you
the day after tomorrow.

484
00:52:53,212 --> 00:52:56,340
- Let's hurry.
- We should warn that woman.

485
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:59,093
You expect me not to warn her?

486
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:01,595
Don't interfere.
It might be provocation.

487
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:03,889
And let that poor woman
be taken away?!

488
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:05,891
Get on!

489
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:21,490
Please go alone now.
I have to see to something here.
