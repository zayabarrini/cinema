1
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,840
I was sheriff of this county
when I was twenty-five years old.

2
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,440
Hard to believe.

3
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,120
Grandfather was a lawman. Father too.

4
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,800
Me and him was sheriff at the same
time, him up in Plano and me out here.

5
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,360
I think he was pretty proud of that.

6
00:00:56,959 --> 00:00:57,759
I know I was.

7
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:02,359
Some of the old-time sheriffs
never even wore a gun.

8
00:01:03,319 --> 00:01:05,319
A lot of folks find that hard to believe.

9
00:01:05,354 --> 00:01:06,959
Jim Scarborough never carried one.

10
00:01:06,994 --> 00:01:08,039
That the younger Jim.

11
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:11,599
Gaston Boykins wouldn't wear
one up in Comanche County.

12
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:15,719
Now I always liked to
hear about the old-timers.

13
00:01:16,999 --> 00:01:18,759
Never missed a chance to do so.

14
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,159
You can't help but compare
yourself against the old-timers.

15
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:27,039
Can't help but wonder how they
would've operated these times.

16
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:32,238
There is this boy I sent to the electric
chair in Huntsville here a while back.

17
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:36,158
My arrest and my testimony.

18
00:01:37,878 --> 00:01:40,078
He killed a
fourteen-year-old girl.

19
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:46,398
Papers said it was a crime of passion but
he told me there wasn't any passion to it.

20
00:01:47,078 --> 00:01:51,318
Told me that he'd been planning to kill some-
body for about as long as he could remember.

21
00:01:51,353 --> 00:01:53,398
Said if they turned him out he'd do it again.

22
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:55,398
Said he knew he was going to hell.

23
00:01:56,998 --> 00:01:58,438
Be there in about fifteen minutes.

24
00:01:59,478 --> 00:02:00,678
I don't know what to make of that.

25
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:03,558
I surely don't.

26
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:08,397
The crime you see now, it's
hard to even take its measure.

27
00:02:10,637 --> 00:02:12,237
It's not that I'm afraid of it.

28
00:02:14,197 --> 00:02:17,797
I always knew you had to be
willing to die to even do this job.

29
00:02:19,117 --> 00:02:21,677
But I don't want to push my chips forward...

30
00:02:22,477 --> 00:02:25,997
...and go out and meet
something I don't understand.

31
00:02:30,357 --> 00:02:32,797
A man would have to put his soul at hazard.

32
00:02:34,557 --> 00:02:36,517
He just have to say, okay.

33
00:02:41,237 --> 00:02:42,437
I'll be part of this world.

34
00:02:44,756 --> 00:02:46,556
Yes sir, I just walked in the door.

35
00:02:47,796 --> 00:02:50,356
Sheriff he had some sort
of thing on him like a...

36
00:02:50,396 --> 00:02:53,036
...oxygen tanks for emphysema or something.

37
00:02:53,476 --> 00:02:55,756
And a hose that run down his sleeve...

38
00:02:58,836 --> 00:02:59,521
You got me.

39
00:02:59,556 --> 00:03:01,476
You'll look at it when you get in.

40
00:03:01,636 --> 00:03:04,156
Yes sir, I got it under control.

41
00:04:42,433 --> 00:04:44,358
Howdy, what's this about?

42
00:04:44,393 --> 00:04:45,873
Step out of the car please, sir.

43
00:04:46,593 --> 00:04:47,193
What is it?

44
00:04:48,153 --> 00:04:49,913
I need you to step out of the car, sir.

45
00:04:57,753 --> 00:04:58,953
What is that for?

46
00:05:00,273 --> 00:05:02,833
Would you hold still please, sir.

47
00:05:32,952 --> 00:05:33,872
Hold still.

48
00:09:15,345 --> 00:09:16,465
Agua.

49
00:09:18,865 --> 00:09:20,025
...Agua. Por Dios.

50
00:09:32,585 --> 00:09:33,545
Agua.

51
00:09:36,265 --> 00:09:37,825
I ain't got no water.

52
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:51,384
Agua.

53
00:09:53,744 --> 00:09:54,944
I ain't got no agua.

54
00:10:10,304 --> 00:10:11,184
You speak English?

55
00:10:13,664 --> 00:10:15,024
Where's the last guy?

56
00:10:16,224 --> 00:10:17,149
Ultimo hombre.

57
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:18,984
Last man standing. There must've been one.

58
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:19,744
Where'd he go?

59
00:10:26,743 --> 00:10:28,863
I reckon I'd go out the way I came in.

60
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:30,983
La puerta...

61
00:10:33,023 --> 00:10:34,023
Hay lobos...

62
00:10:35,623 --> 00:10:36,823
Ain't no lobos.

63
00:10:52,263 --> 00:10:58,263
If you stopped and watch your backtrack,
you're gonna shoot my dumb ass.

64
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:06,302
But if you stopped, you stopped in the shade.

65
00:14:27,257 --> 00:14:28,697
What's in the satchel?

66
00:14:28,732 --> 00:14:30,137
It's full of money.

67
00:14:31,217 --> 00:14:32,297
That'll be the day.

68
00:14:33,777 --> 00:14:34,897
Where'd you get the pistol?

69
00:14:34,932 --> 00:14:36,216
At the gettin' place.

70
00:14:37,496 --> 00:14:38,736
Did you buy that gun?

71
00:14:38,936 --> 00:14:40,456
No. I found it.

72
00:14:42,816 --> 00:14:43,616
Welyn!

73
00:14:43,651 --> 00:14:44,381
What?

74
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:45,496
Quit your hollering.

75
00:14:46,576 --> 00:14:48,056
What'd you give for that thing?

76
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,936
You don't need to know everything, Carla Jean.

77
00:14:53,016 --> 00:14:54,336
I need to know that.

78
00:14:54,896 --> 00:14:58,496
You keep running that mouth of yours I'm
gonna take you in the back and screw you.

79
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:00,496
Big talk.

80
00:15:00,856 --> 00:15:01,776
Keep it up.

81
00:15:02,456 --> 00:15:04,736
Fine. I don't wanna know.

82
00:15:05,896 --> 00:15:07,576
I don't even wanna know
where you been all day.

83
00:15:09,856 --> 00:15:10,775
That'll work.

84
00:15:25,575 --> 00:15:26,135
Alright.

85
00:15:32,855 --> 00:15:33,975
Llewelyn.

86
00:15:34,575 --> 00:15:35,335
Yeah?

87
00:15:37,775 --> 00:15:38,975
What're you doing, baby?

88
00:15:40,415 --> 00:15:41,095
I'm going out.

89
00:15:41,175 --> 00:15:42,215
Going where?

90
00:15:43,215 --> 00:15:45,455
Something I forgot to do but I'll be back.

91
00:15:46,694 --> 00:15:47,699
What're you going to do?

92
00:15:47,734 --> 00:15:51,414
I'm fixing to do something
dumber now but I'm going anyways.

93
00:15:54,014 --> 00:15:56,254
If I don't come back tell Mother I love her.

94
00:15:58,094 --> 00:15:59,454
Your mother's dead, Llewelyn.

95
00:16:03,814 --> 00:16:05,214
Well then. I'll tell her myself.

96
00:20:59,446 --> 00:21:00,286
How much?

97
00:21:00,486 --> 00:21:01,966
Sixty-nine cents.

98
00:21:02,366 --> 00:21:03,566
And the gas.

99
00:21:04,446 --> 00:21:06,526
Y'all getting any rain up your way?

100
00:21:08,165 --> 00:21:09,165
What way would that be?

101
00:21:09,245 --> 00:21:10,885
I seen you was from Dallas.

102
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:19,005
What business is it of yours
where I'm from, friendo?

103
00:21:21,765 --> 00:21:23,165
I didn't mean nothing by it.

104
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:24,685
Didn't mean nothing.

105
00:21:24,885 --> 00:21:27,165
Just passing my time.

106
00:21:29,525 --> 00:21:32,805
If you don't wanna accept that I
don't know what else I can do for you.

107
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:37,405
Will there be something else?

108
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,765
I don't know. Will there?

109
00:21:45,964 --> 00:21:47,004
Is something wrong?

110
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:47,781
With what?

111
00:21:47,816 --> 00:21:48,524
With anything?

112
00:21:50,324 --> 00:21:51,564
Is that what you're asking me?

113
00:21:52,404 --> 00:21:54,124
Is there something wrong with anything?

114
00:21:55,004 --> 00:21:56,084
Will there be anything else?

115
00:21:56,124 --> 00:21:57,164
You already asked me that.

116
00:22:01,444 --> 00:22:03,364
Well... I need to see about closing.

117
00:22:03,804 --> 00:22:05,044
See about closing.

118
00:22:05,164 --> 00:22:05,609
Yes sir.

119
00:22:05,644 --> 00:22:06,724
What time do you close?

120
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:07,961
Now. We close now.

121
00:22:07,996 --> 00:22:09,129
Now is not a time.

122
00:22:09,164 --> 00:22:10,364
What time do you close?

123
00:22:10,404 --> 00:22:12,124
Generally around dark. At dark.

124
00:22:17,164 --> 00:22:18,963
You don't know what you're
talking about, do you?

125
00:22:18,998 --> 00:22:19,563
Sir?

126
00:22:21,803 --> 00:22:24,563
I said you don't know
what you're talking about.

127
00:22:27,643 --> 00:22:28,843
What time do you go to bed?

128
00:22:29,523 --> 00:22:30,043
Sir?

129
00:22:30,243 --> 00:22:31,963
You're a bit deaf, aren't you?

130
00:22:31,998 --> 00:22:33,683
I said what time do you go to bed?

131
00:22:38,283 --> 00:22:39,683
Somewhere around 9:30.

132
00:22:40,283 --> 00:22:41,863
I'd say around 9:30.

133
00:22:41,898 --> 00:22:43,408
I could come back then.

134
00:22:43,443 --> 00:22:44,763
Why would you be coming back?

135
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:45,728
We'd be closed.

136
00:22:45,763 --> 00:22:46,763
Yeah. You said that.

137
00:22:49,123 --> 00:22:50,768
Well... I got to close now.

138
00:22:50,803 --> 00:22:52,363
You live in that house out back?

139
00:22:53,643 --> 00:22:55,482
Yes I do.

140
00:22:56,362 --> 00:22:57,802
You lived here all your life?

141
00:22:59,322 --> 00:23:03,202
This is my wife's father's place. Originally.

142
00:23:06,042 --> 00:23:06,922
You married into it.

143
00:23:07,642 --> 00:23:10,282
We lived in Temple Texas for many years.

144
00:23:11,762 --> 00:23:13,202
Raised a family there.

145
00:23:14,002 --> 00:23:15,207
In Temple.

146
00:23:15,242 --> 00:23:17,362
We come out here about four years ago.

147
00:23:18,322 --> 00:23:19,202
You married into it.

148
00:23:20,002 --> 00:23:21,482
If that's the way you wanna put it.

149
00:23:21,762 --> 00:23:23,442
I don't have some way to put it.

150
00:23:24,562 --> 00:23:25,642
That's the way it is.

151
00:23:34,001 --> 00:23:36,401
What's the most you've
ever lost in a coin toss?

152
00:23:37,761 --> 00:23:38,246
Sir?

153
00:23:38,281 --> 00:23:41,601
The most you ever lost in a coin toss.

154
00:23:43,761 --> 00:23:45,361
I don't know. I couldn't say.

155
00:23:48,481 --> 00:23:49,321
Call it.

156
00:23:50,081 --> 00:23:50,561
Call it?

157
00:23:50,681 --> 00:23:51,201
Yes.

158
00:23:51,841 --> 00:23:52,521
For what?

159
00:23:52,761 --> 00:23:53,561
Just call it.

160
00:23:56,681 --> 00:24:00,361
Well, we need to know what
we're calling it for here.

161
00:24:00,396 --> 00:24:01,401
You need to call it.

162
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:03,161
I can't call it for you.

163
00:24:04,001 --> 00:24:05,240
It wouldn't be fair.

164
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,920
I didn't put nothing up.

165
00:24:06,955 --> 00:24:08,200
Yes, you did.

166
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,520
You've been putting it up your whole life.

167
00:24:10,555 --> 00:24:11,600
You just didn't know it.

168
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,760
You know what date is on this coin?

169
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,000
No.

170
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:16,960
1958.

171
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,080
It's been traveling
twenty-two years to get here.

172
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,560
And now it's here.

173
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,920
And it's either heads or tails.

174
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,680
And you have to say. Call it.

175
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,040
Look... I need to know what I stand to win.

176
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,200
Everything.

177
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,045
How's that?

178
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,240
You stand to win everything. Call it.

179
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:43,159
Alright. Heads then.

180
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:48,839
Well done.

181
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:52,159
Don't put it in your pocket.

182
00:24:52,279 --> 00:24:53,164
Sir?

183
00:24:53,199 --> 00:24:55,239
Don't put it in your pocket.
It's your lucky quarter.

184
00:24:57,519 --> 00:24:58,639
Where you want me to put it?

185
00:24:58,674 --> 00:24:59,759
Anywhere not in your pocket.

186
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:04,079
Or it'll be mixed in with the
others and become just a coin.

187
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:09,119
Which it is.

188
00:25:21,158 --> 00:25:21,958
Llewelyn?

189
00:25:25,078 --> 00:25:25,838
What the hell?

190
00:25:28,238 --> 00:25:28,918
Odessa.

191
00:25:29,478 --> 00:25:31,118
Why would we go to Odessa?

192
00:25:31,438 --> 00:25:34,078
Not we, you. Stay with your mother.

193
00:25:34,918 --> 00:25:35,758
Well, how come?

194
00:25:36,478 --> 00:25:38,123
Right now it's midnight Sunday.

195
00:25:38,158 --> 00:25:40,323
When the courthouse opens
nine hours from now...

196
00:25:40,358 --> 00:25:43,758
...someone's gonna be callin' in the vehicle
number on the inspection plate on the truck.

197
00:25:44,398 --> 00:25:46,238
And by 9:30, they'll show up here.

198
00:25:46,838 --> 00:25:48,243
But for how long do we have to...

199
00:25:48,278 --> 00:25:51,518
Baby, at what point would you quit bothering
to look for your two million dollars?

200
00:25:52,917 --> 00:25:54,317
What am I supposed to tell Mama?

201
00:25:55,277 --> 00:25:57,797
Try standin' in the door
and holler "Mama, I'm home".

202
00:25:57,832 --> 00:25:58,562
Llewelyn...

203
00:25:58,597 --> 00:25:59,482
C'mon, pack your things.

204
00:25:59,517 --> 00:26:02,157
Anything you leave you
ain't gonna see it again.

205
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:07,877
Well, thanks for falling
all over and apologizing.

206
00:26:08,597 --> 00:26:12,717
Baby, things happened. I can't take 'em back.

207
00:26:36,156 --> 00:26:37,316
Mind ridin', bitch?

208
00:26:50,956 --> 00:26:51,676
This his truck?

209
00:26:52,156 --> 00:26:52,716
Mm-Mm.

210
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:58,076
Got a screwgie?

211
00:27:02,036 --> 00:27:03,280
Who cut his tires?

212
00:27:03,315 --> 00:27:05,955
Mexicans, I guess. Wasn't us.

213
00:27:07,355 --> 00:27:08,795
That's a dead dog.

214
00:27:08,995 --> 00:27:09,955
Yes, it is.

215
00:27:14,115 --> 00:27:15,075
Where's the receiver?

216
00:27:15,275 --> 00:27:16,235
I've got it.

217
00:27:18,395 --> 00:27:19,355
They're ripe petunias.

218
00:27:20,955 --> 00:27:22,235
Hold this please.

219
00:27:30,555 --> 00:27:31,755
You want it?

220
00:27:34,275 --> 00:27:35,435
You getting anything though?

221
00:27:36,195 --> 00:27:37,235
Not a bleep.

222
00:27:38,475 --> 00:27:39,394
Alright...

223
00:27:42,794 --> 00:27:43,594
Gimme that.

224
00:27:54,074 --> 00:27:56,074
I thought it was a car afire.

225
00:27:56,109 --> 00:27:57,039
It is a car afire.

226
00:27:57,074 --> 00:27:59,354
Wendell said there was
something backcountry too.

227
00:28:01,834 --> 00:28:04,674
When is the county gonna start
paying a rental on my horse?

228
00:28:04,709 --> 00:28:06,154
I love you more and more every day.

229
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:07,554
That's very nice.

230
00:28:09,234 --> 00:28:09,814
Be careful.

231
00:28:09,849 --> 00:28:10,394
Always am.

232
00:28:10,954 --> 00:28:11,594
Don't get hurt.

233
00:28:11,629 --> 00:28:12,394
Never do.

234
00:28:12,634 --> 00:28:13,754
Don't hurt no one.

235
00:28:16,913 --> 00:28:17,833
If you say so.

236
00:28:52,912 --> 00:28:55,512
Wouldn't think a car would burn like that.

237
00:28:55,632 --> 00:28:59,037
Yes sir. We should've brought weenies.

238
00:28:59,072 --> 00:29:01,672
That look like about a
'77 Ford to you, Wendell?

239
00:29:02,032 --> 00:29:03,077
It could be.

240
00:29:03,112 --> 00:29:05,152
I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.

241
00:29:05,392 --> 00:29:07,032
The old boy shot by the highway?

242
00:29:07,067 --> 00:29:09,392
Yes sir, his vehicle.

243
00:29:10,512 --> 00:29:13,072
Man killed Lamar's deputy and took his car.

244
00:29:13,107 --> 00:29:14,512
Killed that man on the highway...

245
00:29:14,547 --> 00:29:15,837
...swapped for his car...

246
00:29:15,872 --> 00:29:19,312
...and now here it is and he's
swapped again for god knows what.

247
00:29:20,312 --> 00:29:23,272
That's very linear, Sheriff.

248
00:29:23,632 --> 00:29:25,317
Well. Old age flattens a man.

249
00:29:25,352 --> 00:29:28,991
Yes sir. But then there's this other.

250
00:29:31,031 --> 00:29:32,631
You ride Winston.

251
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:34,911
- You sure?
- Oh, I'm more than sure.

252
00:29:35,831 --> 00:29:37,596
Anything happens to
Loretta's horse out here...

253
00:29:37,631 --> 00:29:40,591
...I can tell you right now I don't
wanna be the party that was aboard.

254
00:29:41,911 --> 00:29:44,671
It's the same tire tread coming back as going.

255
00:29:44,751 --> 00:29:48,071
Made about the same time too.
You can see the sides real clear.

256
00:29:50,391 --> 00:29:53,351
Somebodies pried the inspection
plate off the door on this one.

257
00:29:55,431 --> 00:29:57,791
I know this truck.

258
00:29:58,151 --> 00:30:00,271
Belongs to a fella named Moss.

259
00:30:00,631 --> 00:30:02,950
- Llewelyn Moss?
- That's the boy.

260
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:06,310
You figure him for a dope-runner?

261
00:30:06,345 --> 00:30:09,030
I don't know but I kindly doubt it.

262
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:11,310
OK Corral is just down there.

263
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:15,750
Oh hell's bells, they even shot the dog.

264
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:22,470
Well this is just a deal gone wrong, isn't it?

265
00:30:22,505 --> 00:30:25,470
Yeah, appears to have been a glitch or two.

266
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:32,570
What calibers you got there, Sheriff?

267
00:30:32,605 --> 00:30:35,710
Nine millimeter. Couple of .45 ACP's.

268
00:30:37,149 --> 00:30:40,389
Somebody unloaded on
that thing with a shotgun.

269
00:30:42,829 --> 00:30:45,149
How come do you reckon the
coyotes ain't been at 'em?

270
00:30:45,184 --> 00:30:46,989
I don't know.

271
00:30:52,149 --> 00:30:54,949
Supposedly coyotes won't eat a Mexican.

272
00:30:55,189 --> 00:30:57,869
These boys appear to be managerial.

273
00:30:58,349 --> 00:31:00,749
I think we're looking at
more than one fracas...

274
00:31:00,784 --> 00:31:02,234
Execution here...

275
00:31:02,269 --> 00:31:04,189
...Wild West over there

276
00:31:05,469 --> 00:31:07,609
That Mexican brown dope.

277
00:31:07,644 --> 00:31:09,714
These boys is all swole up.

278
00:31:09,749 --> 00:31:12,708
So this was earlier, getting set to trade.

279
00:31:12,748 --> 00:31:15,188
Then, whoa, differences...

280
00:31:15,908 --> 00:31:17,868
You know might not of even been no money.

281
00:31:17,908 --> 00:31:19,388
That's possible.

282
00:31:19,828 --> 00:31:21,228
But you don't believe it.

283
00:31:21,868 --> 00:31:24,748
No. Probably I don't.

284
00:31:27,708 --> 00:31:30,068
Well, it's a mess, ain't it Sheriff?

285
00:31:32,268 --> 00:31:35,668
If it ain't, it'll do till a mess gets here.

286
00:33:29,065 --> 00:33:29,945
Yes sir?

287
00:33:31,345 --> 00:33:32,945
I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.

288
00:33:33,305 --> 00:33:35,064
Did you go up to his trailer?

289
00:33:35,424 --> 00:33:35,904
Yes.

290
00:33:36,504 --> 00:33:39,744
Well, I'd say he's at work.
Do you want to leave a message?

291
00:33:39,864 --> 00:33:40,864
Where does he work?

292
00:33:41,384 --> 00:33:42,464
I can't say.

293
00:33:45,104 --> 00:33:46,309
Where does he work?

294
00:33:46,344 --> 00:33:50,784
Sir, I ain't at liberty to give out
no information about our residents.

295
00:33:51,784 --> 00:33:53,589
Where does he work?

296
00:33:53,624 --> 00:33:59,104
Did you not hear me? We
can't give out no information.

297
00:34:21,663 --> 00:34:23,268
Why all the way to Del Rio?

298
00:34:23,303 --> 00:34:25,663
I'm gonna borrow a car from Roberto.

299
00:34:25,743 --> 00:34:27,263
You can't afford one?

300
00:34:28,223 --> 00:34:29,708
I don't wanna register it.

301
00:34:29,743 --> 00:34:31,543
Look, I'll call you in a couple days.

302
00:34:31,578 --> 00:34:33,623
- Promise?
- Yes, I do.

303
00:34:34,703 --> 00:34:36,588
I got a bad feeling, Llewelyn.

304
00:34:36,623 --> 00:34:39,143
Well I got a good one.
So, they ought to even out.

305
00:34:39,863 --> 00:34:42,503
Quit worrying so much.

306
00:34:43,063 --> 00:34:44,503
Mama's gonna raise hell.

307
00:34:45,303 --> 00:34:47,102
She is just gonna curse you up and down.

308
00:34:47,137 --> 00:34:49,067
You should be used to that.

309
00:34:49,102 --> 00:34:52,022
I'm used to lots of
things, I work at Wal-Mart.

310
00:34:52,222 --> 00:34:55,502
Not any more, Carla Jean. You're retired.

311
00:34:55,782 --> 00:34:58,222
- Llewelyn?
- Yes ma'am?

312
00:34:59,902 --> 00:35:04,902
- You are coming back, ain't ya?
- I shall return.

313
00:35:09,742 --> 00:35:11,662
Sheriff's Department!

314
00:35:13,662 --> 00:35:15,262
Look at that lock.

315
00:35:18,062 --> 00:35:19,442
We goin' in?

316
00:35:19,477 --> 00:35:20,822
Gun out and up.

317
00:35:24,341 --> 00:35:27,541
- What about yours?
- I'm hiding behind you.

318
00:35:30,501 --> 00:35:32,301
Sheriff's Department!

319
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,420
I believe they've lit a shuck.

320
00:36:00,455 --> 00:36:01,897
I believe you're right.

321
00:36:01,932 --> 00:36:03,340
That from the lock?

322
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,380
Probably must be.

323
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,020
When was he here, Sheriff?

324
00:36:07,055 --> 00:36:07,745
I don't know.

325
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:10,940
Oh. Now that's aggravating.

326
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:11,945
Sheriff?

327
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,540
Still sweating.

328
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:17,340
Oh, Sheriff, we just missed him!

329
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:21,460
We gotta circulate this. On radio.

330
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,500
Alright.

331
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,580
What do we circulate?

332
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:32,140
Looking for a man who has recently drunk milk?

333
00:36:35,379 --> 00:36:37,979
Ah, Sheriff, that's aggravating.

334
00:36:38,014 --> 00:36:40,139
I'm ahead of you there.

335
00:36:42,019 --> 00:36:46,859
You think this boy Moss has got any notion of
the sorts of sons of bitches that are hunting him?

336
00:36:46,894 --> 00:36:49,019
I don't know. He ought to...

337
00:36:51,859 --> 00:36:54,144
He seen the same things I've seen...

338
00:36:54,179 --> 00:36:57,259
...and it certainly made an impression on me.

339
00:37:03,259 --> 00:37:05,219
- Take me to a motel.
- Got one in mind?

340
00:37:05,254 --> 00:37:06,859
Someplace cheap.

341
00:37:08,858 --> 00:37:10,938
You tell me the option.

342
00:37:10,973 --> 00:37:12,263
Do what now?

343
00:37:12,298 --> 00:37:15,978
You pick the option goes
with the applicable rate.

344
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:20,818
I'm just one person. So, don't
matter the size of the bed.

345
00:37:27,018 --> 00:37:29,898
This is Roberto Sagramore,
I'm not here right now.

346
00:37:29,933 --> 00:37:31,298
Please leave a message.

347
00:39:30,615 --> 00:39:31,894
Hello?

348
00:39:32,654 --> 00:39:34,374
Is Llewelyn there?

349
00:39:34,654 --> 00:39:37,374
Llewelyn?! No he ain't.

350
00:39:38,254 --> 00:39:39,859
You expect him?

351
00:39:39,894 --> 00:39:41,814
Now why would I expect him?

352
00:39:42,174 --> 00:39:44,014
Who's this?

353
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:53,139
Can I help you?

354
00:39:53,174 --> 00:39:56,374
Yeah. You got a pair of Larry
Mahan's, shoulder size 11.

355
00:39:56,409 --> 00:39:57,779
I'll check.

356
00:39:57,814 --> 00:39:59,734
- You sell socks?
- Just white.

357
00:39:59,774 --> 00:40:01,574
White is all I wear.

358
00:40:01,814 --> 00:40:03,374
You got a bathroom?

359
00:40:28,853 --> 00:40:32,373
Don't stop. Just ride me up past those rooms.

360
00:40:32,493 --> 00:40:35,733
- What room?
- Just drive me around.

361
00:40:36,173 --> 00:40:37,973
I want to see if someone's here.

362
00:40:45,972 --> 00:40:47,612
Keep going. Don't stop.

363
00:40:48,052 --> 00:40:50,932
I don't wanna get into some
kind of a jackpot here, buddy.

364
00:40:50,967 --> 00:40:52,292
It's alright.

365
00:40:53,092 --> 00:40:56,092
Why don't I just set you down around
here and we won't argue about it.

366
00:40:57,012 --> 00:40:58,692
Take me to another motel.

367
00:40:58,812 --> 00:41:00,177
Let's just call it square.

368
00:41:00,212 --> 00:41:03,212
Look, you're already in a jackpot.
I'm trying to get you out of it.

369
00:41:03,247 --> 00:41:04,892
Now take me to another motel.

370
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:57,010
The lab reports from Austin
on that boy by the highway.

371
00:41:57,045 --> 00:41:58,347
What was the bullet?

372
00:41:58,382 --> 00:41:59,650
There wasn't no bullet.

373
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:02,250
Wasn't no bullet?

374
00:42:02,285 --> 00:42:03,730
Yes sir. Wasn't none.

375
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:08,970
Well, Wendell, with all due respect,
that don't make a lot of sense.

376
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:10,610
No sir.

377
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:13,410
You said entry wound in the forehead.

378
00:42:13,445 --> 00:42:14,770
No exit wound.

379
00:42:14,805 --> 00:42:15,575
Yes sir.

380
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:17,455
Are you telling he shot
this boy in the head...

381
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:19,610
...and then went digging around
in there with a pocket knife?

382
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:22,650
Sir, I don't want to picture that.

383
00:42:22,685 --> 00:42:24,055
I don't either!

384
00:42:24,090 --> 00:42:25,930
Can I freshen that there for you, Sheriff?

385
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:28,490
Yeah, Noreen, you better had.

386
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:31,969
The Rangers and the DEA are headed
back out to the scene this morning.

387
00:42:32,289 --> 00:42:34,209
You gonna join 'em?

388
00:42:34,809 --> 00:42:36,689
Any new bodies accumulated out there?

389
00:42:38,329 --> 00:42:39,609
No sir.

390
00:42:39,689 --> 00:42:41,609
Well then, I guess I can skip it.

391
00:42:56,289 --> 00:42:58,534
Twelve gauge. You need shells?

392
00:42:58,569 --> 00:43:02,569
- Yeah. Double ought.
- They'll give you a wallop.

393
00:43:02,729 --> 00:43:04,529
Y'all got camping supplies?

394
00:43:04,564 --> 00:43:06,613
Tent poles?

395
00:43:06,648 --> 00:43:08,108
You already have a tent?

396
00:43:08,143 --> 00:43:09,533
Somethin' like that.

397
00:43:09,568 --> 00:43:12,328
Well, you give me the model number on
the tent, I can order you the poles.

398
00:43:12,368 --> 00:43:13,853
Never mind. I want a tent.

399
00:43:13,888 --> 00:43:17,208
- Well, what kind of tent?
- The kind with the most poles.

400
00:43:39,688 --> 00:43:41,047
Could I get another room?

401
00:43:41,082 --> 00:43:42,372
You want to change rooms?

402
00:43:42,407 --> 00:43:44,887
No m'am, I want to keep my
room and get another one.

403
00:43:44,922 --> 00:43:46,287
Another additional?

404
00:43:46,322 --> 00:43:47,532
Yes, m'am.

405
00:43:47,567 --> 00:43:49,767
And do you have a map of the rooms?

406
00:43:49,802 --> 00:43:52,887
Yeah, we had a sorta one.

407
00:44:00,327 --> 00:44:01,927
How bout 38?

408
00:44:02,007 --> 00:44:04,887
Well, you can have the one
right next to yours if you want.

409
00:44:04,922 --> 00:44:06,807
Number 137. It ain't took.

410
00:44:06,842 --> 00:44:08,487
No, 38 will be fine.

411
00:44:08,847 --> 00:44:10,967
That's got two double beds.

412
00:50:38,796 --> 00:50:40,316
No me, mate.

413
00:50:46,356 --> 00:50:48,235
How'd you find it?

414
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:50,875
No me, mate.

415
00:52:35,112 --> 00:52:39,912
Shouldn't be doin' that.
Even a young man like you.

416
00:52:41,552 --> 00:52:45,632
- Doing what?
- Hitchhiking.

417
00:52:50,992 --> 00:52:53,032
Dangerous.

418
00:53:10,951 --> 00:53:14,311
You know Anton Chigurh
by sight, is that correct?

419
00:53:14,346 --> 00:53:16,951
Yes sir.

420
00:53:17,911 --> 00:53:19,631
When did you last see him?

421
00:53:21,871 --> 00:53:24,471
November 28th, last year.

422
00:53:25,591 --> 00:53:29,071
You seem pretty sure of the
date. Did I ask you to sit?

423
00:53:29,106 --> 00:53:29,756
No sir.

424
00:53:29,791 --> 00:53:34,071
But you struck me as a man who
wouldn't want to waste a chair.

425
00:53:34,106 --> 00:53:38,351
I remember dates. Names. Numbers.
I saw him November the 28th.

426
00:53:41,031 --> 00:53:42,916
We got a loose cannon here.

427
00:53:42,951 --> 00:53:44,236
And we're out a bunch of money...

428
00:53:44,271 --> 00:53:46,190
...and the other party is out his product.

429
00:53:46,225 --> 00:53:47,155
Yes sir.

430
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:52,150
This account will give up twelve hundred
dollars in any twenty-four hour period.

431
00:53:52,185 --> 00:53:54,230
That's up from a thousand.

432
00:53:54,350 --> 00:53:56,990
If your expenses run higher
I hope you'll trust us for it.

433
00:53:57,830 --> 00:53:59,350
Okay.

434
00:54:00,110 --> 00:54:02,590
Just how well do you know Chigurh?

435
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:03,995
What do you want to know?

436
00:54:04,030 --> 00:54:06,510
I just want to know your opinion of him.

437
00:54:06,545 --> 00:54:07,430
In general.

438
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:10,350
Just how dangerous is he?

439
00:54:10,390 --> 00:54:13,310
Compared to what? The bubonic plague?

440
00:54:13,430 --> 00:54:15,550
He's bad enough that you called me.

441
00:54:15,630 --> 00:54:19,270
Yeah, he's a psychopathic killer but so what?

442
00:54:20,270 --> 00:54:21,749
There's plenty of them around.

443
00:54:21,989 --> 00:54:24,594
He killed three men in
Del Rio Motel yesterday.

444
00:54:24,629 --> 00:54:28,389
And two others in that colossal
goatfuck out in the desert.

445
00:54:28,749 --> 00:54:30,114
We can stop that.

446
00:54:30,149 --> 00:54:31,869
You seem pretty sure of yourself.

447
00:54:33,629 --> 00:54:37,589
You've led something of a charmed
life haven't you, Mr. Wells?

448
00:54:38,109 --> 00:54:39,514
In all honesty...

449
00:54:39,549 --> 00:54:43,229
...I can't say that charm has
had a whole lot to do with it.

450
00:54:45,109 --> 00:54:46,549
I'm wondering...

451
00:54:46,589 --> 00:54:47,989
Yes?

452
00:54:48,749 --> 00:54:51,229
Can I get my parking ticket validated?

453
00:54:53,309 --> 00:54:56,109
An attempt at humor, I suppose.

454
00:54:56,149 --> 00:54:57,668
I'm sorry.

455
00:55:02,108 --> 00:55:08,068
You know I counted the floors
of this building from the street?

456
00:55:08,428 --> 00:55:10,548
There's one missing.

457
00:55:12,948 --> 00:55:14,948
We'll look into it.

458
00:55:34,627 --> 00:55:37,307
One room, one night.

459
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:40,867
- That'll be twenty-six
dollars. - Alright.

460
00:55:45,227 --> 00:55:46,712
You on all night?

461
00:55:46,747 --> 00:55:49,747
Yes sir, I'll be around here
until ten o'clock in the morning.

462
00:55:51,667 --> 00:55:55,307
This here's for you. Now, I ain't
asking you to do anything illegal.

463
00:55:56,107 --> 00:55:58,387
There's someone who's been
looking for me. Not police.

464
00:55:58,422 --> 00:56:01,907
Just call me if anyone else checks in tonight.

465
00:56:02,027 --> 00:56:04,747
By anyone, I mean any swinging dude.

466
00:56:46,325 --> 00:56:48,545
There just ain't no way.

467
01:02:26,296 --> 01:02:28,136
Don't worry. I ain't gonna hurt you.

468
01:02:28,936 --> 01:02:30,936
I need you to drive me on out of here.

469
01:06:16,649 --> 01:06:18,089
Were you in a car accident?

470
01:06:19,329 --> 01:06:20,409
Yeah.

471
01:06:21,809 --> 01:06:24,489
- Gimme the money.
- It's right here. Give me the clothes.

472
01:06:24,809 --> 01:06:27,009
Let him hold the money.

473
01:06:42,609 --> 01:06:44,329
Gimme that beer too.

474
01:06:46,649 --> 01:06:47,969
How much?

475
01:06:49,129 --> 01:06:50,888
Brian. Give him the beer.

476
01:09:02,765 --> 01:09:06,885
Medico. Por favor.

477
01:13:11,118 --> 01:13:12,758
Any word on those vehicles yet?

478
01:13:13,478 --> 01:13:15,798
Sheriff, I found out
everything there was to find.

479
01:13:16,438 --> 01:13:19,598
Those vehicles are titled and
registered to deceased people.

480
01:13:20,998 --> 01:13:23,397
The owner of that Bronco's
been dead twenty years.

481
01:13:23,637 --> 01:13:25,757
Did you want me to see what I could
find out about the Mexican ones?

482
01:13:26,197 --> 01:13:27,757
No. Lord no.

483
01:13:28,637 --> 01:13:30,397
Here's this month's checks.

484
01:13:31,717 --> 01:13:33,257
That DEA agent called again.

485
01:13:33,292 --> 01:13:34,762
You don't want to talk to him?

486
01:13:34,797 --> 01:13:36,957
I'm goin' to try and keep
from it as much as I can.

487
01:13:37,277 --> 01:13:40,317
He's goin' back out there and he wanted
to know if you wanted to go with him.

488
01:13:40,357 --> 01:13:42,077
That's cordial of him.

489
01:13:42,877 --> 01:13:45,122
Could I get you to call Loretta for me...

490
01:13:45,157 --> 01:13:47,437
...and tell her I'm goin' to
Odessa to see Carla Jean Moss?

491
01:13:47,477 --> 01:13:48,917
Yes, Sheriff.

492
01:13:48,957 --> 01:13:51,117
I'll call her when I get there.

493
01:13:51,157 --> 01:13:53,917
I'd call her now but she'll want
me to come home and I just might.

494
01:13:53,957 --> 01:13:56,877
You want me to wait till
you've quit the building?

495
01:13:57,516 --> 01:14:00,796
You don't want to lie without
what it's absolutely necessary.

496
01:14:03,996 --> 01:14:06,916
What is it that Torbert
says about truth and justice?

497
01:14:07,676 --> 01:14:11,476
Oh, we dedicate ourselves
daily anew. Something like that.

498
01:14:11,516 --> 01:14:14,356
I think I'm goin' to commence
dedicatin' myself twice daily.

499
01:14:14,396 --> 01:14:17,156
It might come to three
times before it's over...

500
01:14:18,556 --> 01:14:20,116
Oh, what the hell?

501
01:14:28,636 --> 01:14:29,956
Sheriff?

502
01:14:31,436 --> 01:14:32,396
Have you looked at your load lately?

503
01:14:34,715 --> 01:14:35,755
That is a damned outrage.

504
01:14:37,115 --> 01:14:38,995
Oh. One of those tiedowns worked lose.

505
01:14:39,235 --> 01:14:40,635
How many bodies did you leave with?

506
01:14:41,195 --> 01:14:42,915
I ain't lost none of 'em, Sheriff.

507
01:14:44,235 --> 01:14:46,475
Couldn't you all of took a van out there?

508
01:14:46,915 --> 01:14:49,035
Didn't have no van with four-wheel drive.

509
01:14:49,275 --> 01:14:51,755
You going to write me up
for improperly secured load?

510
01:14:51,795 --> 01:14:53,435
You get your ass out of here.

511
01:15:00,675 --> 01:15:03,555
I'm guessin' this isn't the future
you had pictured for yourself...

512
01:15:03,595 --> 01:15:06,475
...when you first clapped eyes on that money.

513
01:15:07,115 --> 01:15:10,474
Don't worry. I'm not the man that's after you.

514
01:15:11,074 --> 01:15:12,474
I know.

515
01:15:14,354 --> 01:15:17,114
- I've seen him.
- You've seen him?

516
01:15:17,394 --> 01:15:19,194
And you're not dead.

517
01:15:21,354 --> 01:15:24,194
Is this guy supposed to
be the ultimate bad-ass?

518
01:15:24,434 --> 01:15:27,754
- I don't think that's how I'd describe him.
- How would you describe him?

519
01:15:29,074 --> 01:15:32,274
I guess I'd say... he
doesn't have a sense of humor.

520
01:15:32,714 --> 01:15:34,394
His name is Chigurh.

521
01:15:34,434 --> 01:15:37,074
- Sugar?
- Chigurh. Anton Chigurh.

522
01:15:37,794 --> 01:15:40,874
- You know how he found you?
- I know how he found me.

523
01:15:40,914 --> 01:15:43,674
- It's called a transponder.
- I know what it is.

524
01:15:44,193 --> 01:15:45,913
He won't find me again.

525
01:15:46,233 --> 01:15:48,233
- Not that way.
- Not any way.

526
01:15:48,273 --> 01:15:51,793
- Took me about three hours.
- Yeah, well, I've been immobile.

527
01:15:52,713 --> 01:15:55,233
No. You don't understand.

528
01:15:56,953 --> 01:16:00,513
- What do you do?
- I'm retired.

529
01:16:00,713 --> 01:16:02,193
What did you do?

530
01:16:02,233 --> 01:16:04,473
- Welder.
- Acetylene? Mig? Tig?

531
01:16:04,513 --> 01:16:06,953
Any of it. If it can be welded, I can weld it.

532
01:16:06,993 --> 01:16:08,878
- Cast iron?
- Yes.

533
01:16:08,913 --> 01:16:11,233
- I don't mean braze.
- I didn't say braze.

534
01:16:11,273 --> 01:16:13,433
- Pot metal?
- What did I say?

535
01:16:15,033 --> 01:16:16,713
Were you in Nam?

536
01:16:18,153 --> 01:16:19,792
Yeah. I was in Nam.

537
01:16:21,552 --> 01:16:23,392
So was I.

538
01:16:23,752 --> 01:16:26,032
So what does that make me, your buddy?

539
01:16:27,952 --> 01:16:32,432
Look, you gotta give me this money.
I got no other reason to protect you.

540
01:16:33,672 --> 01:16:35,992
It's too late. I spent it.

541
01:16:37,792 --> 01:16:41,712
About a million and a half on whores and whiskey
...and the rest of it, I just sort of blew it here.

542
01:16:44,672 --> 01:16:47,352
How do you know he's not on his way to Odessa?

543
01:16:51,272 --> 01:16:55,351
- Why would he go to Odessa?
- To kill your wife.

544
01:17:02,551 --> 01:17:04,631
Maybe he's the one who needs to be worried.

545
01:17:05,831 --> 01:17:08,111
- About me.
- He isn't.

546
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:12,231
You're not cut out for this.

547
01:17:12,871 --> 01:17:16,791
You're just a guy who happened
to find those vehicles.

548
01:17:21,991 --> 01:17:26,511
I'm across the river. At the
Hotel Eagle. Carson Wells.

549
01:17:27,671 --> 01:17:29,831
Call me when you've had enough.

550
01:17:30,071 --> 01:17:32,550
I can even let you keep a little of the money.

551
01:17:32,910 --> 01:17:33,995
If I was into cutting deals...

552
01:17:34,030 --> 01:17:36,310
...why wouldn't I just
deal with this guy Chigurh?

553
01:17:37,030 --> 01:17:40,630
You don't understand. You
can't make a deal with him.

554
01:17:40,950 --> 01:17:43,470
Even if you gave him the money
back, he'd still kill you...

555
01:17:43,505 --> 01:17:45,990
...just for inconvenience in him.

556
01:17:46,270 --> 01:17:49,950
He's a peculiar man. Might
even say he has principles.

557
01:17:50,230 --> 01:17:55,030
Principles that transcend money
or drugs or anything like that.

558
01:17:55,510 --> 01:18:00,070
He's not like you. He's not even like me.

559
01:18:00,910 --> 01:18:04,550
He don't talk as much as you,
I give him points for that.

560
01:18:06,389 --> 01:18:08,549
Carla Jean. Thank you for comin'.

561
01:18:08,589 --> 01:18:09,989
Don't know why I did.

562
01:18:10,669 --> 01:18:13,549
I told you, I don't know where he is.

563
01:18:13,789 --> 01:18:15,829
- You ain't heard from him?
- No I ain't.

564
01:18:15,869 --> 01:18:17,749
- Nothin'?
- Not word one.

565
01:18:17,949 --> 01:18:21,869
- Would you tell me if you had?
- Well, I don't know.

566
01:18:22,829 --> 01:18:26,149
- He don't need any trouble from you.
- It ain't me he's in trouble with.

567
01:18:26,949 --> 01:18:30,149
- Who's he in trouble with then?
- Some pretty bad people.

568
01:18:31,149 --> 01:18:34,429
These people will kill him,
Carla Jean. They won't quit.

569
01:18:34,709 --> 01:18:37,629
He won't neither. He never has.

570
01:18:38,269 --> 01:18:40,469
He can take all comers.

571
01:18:43,148 --> 01:18:46,588
You know Charlie Walser? He's got
that place out east of Sanderson?

572
01:18:49,788 --> 01:18:52,908
Well you know how they used to slaughter
beefs, hit 'em right there with a maul...

573
01:18:52,948 --> 01:18:54,708
.. truss 'em up and slit their throats?

574
01:18:55,188 --> 01:18:57,908
Here Charlie's got one all trussed
up and all set to drain him...

575
01:18:57,948 --> 01:19:00,308
...and the beef comes to.
It starts thrashing around.

576
01:19:01,348 --> 01:19:05,508
Six hundred pounds of very pissed-off
livestock if you'll excuse me.

577
01:19:06,508 --> 01:19:09,188
Charlie grabs his gun there to
shoot the damn thing in the head...

578
01:19:09,588 --> 01:19:14,988
...but with all the swayin' and then the trashin' it's a glance-shot
and ricochets around and comes back hits Charlie in the shoulder.

579
01:19:15,028 --> 01:19:16,193
You go see Charlie...

580
01:19:16,228 --> 01:19:18,707
he still can't pick up his
right hand for his hat...

581
01:19:19,267 --> 01:19:22,387
The point bein', even in the
contest between man and steer...

582
01:19:22,422 --> 01:19:24,907
...the issue is not certain.

583
01:19:32,627 --> 01:19:37,347
When Llewelyn calls, just
tell him I'll make him safe.

584
01:19:42,147 --> 01:19:44,787
Course they slaughter steers
a lot different these days.

585
01:19:45,747 --> 01:19:47,587
Use a air gun.

586
01:19:47,787 --> 01:19:52,827
Shoots out a little rock, about that far into the brain.
Sucks right back in. Animal never knows what hit him.

587
01:19:55,986 --> 01:19:59,346
- Why you telling me that, Sheriff?
- I don't know.

588
01:20:03,386 --> 01:20:05,506
My mind wanders.

589
01:21:28,544 --> 01:21:29,824
Hello, Carson.

590
01:21:32,944 --> 01:21:34,144
Let's go to your room.

591
01:21:46,903 --> 01:21:49,068
We don't have to do this.

592
01:21:49,103 --> 01:21:53,503
I'm a daytrader. I could just go home.

593
01:21:55,463 --> 01:21:56,783
Why would I let you do that?

594
01:21:57,063 --> 01:21:59,063
I'll make it worth your while.

595
01:21:59,103 --> 01:22:02,703
Take you to an ATM. Fourteen grand in it.

596
01:22:02,823 --> 01:22:04,743
And everybody just walks away.

597
01:22:06,663 --> 01:22:08,423
An ATM...

598
01:22:12,623 --> 01:22:17,462
- I know where the satchel is.
- If you knew, you would have it with you.

599
01:22:18,142 --> 01:22:22,222
Find it from the river
bank. I know where it is.

600
01:22:23,462 --> 01:22:25,382
I know something better.

601
01:22:26,022 --> 01:22:28,062
- What's that?
- I know where it's going to be.

602
01:22:29,542 --> 01:22:36,062
- Where is that?
- It will be brought to me and placed at my feet.

603
01:22:37,502 --> 01:22:42,902
You don't know to a certainty.
Twenty minutes it could be here.

604
01:22:43,102 --> 01:22:47,262
I do know to a certainty. And you know
what's going to happen now, Carson?

605
01:22:48,342 --> 01:22:52,901
You should admit your situation.
There would be more dignity in it.

606
01:22:58,141 --> 01:22:59,541
You go to hell.

607
01:23:01,861 --> 01:23:03,101
Alright.

608
01:23:03,541 --> 01:23:04,901
Let me ask you something.

609
01:23:06,941 --> 01:23:11,861
If the rule you followed
brought you to this...

610
01:23:11,896 --> 01:23:14,301
...of what use was the rule?

611
01:23:19,901 --> 01:23:24,221
Do you have any idea how crazy you are?

612
01:23:25,301 --> 01:23:27,620
You mean the nature of this conversation?

613
01:23:27,980 --> 01:23:29,780
I mean the nature of you.

614
01:23:36,220 --> 01:23:40,420
You can have the money, Anton.

615
01:24:19,739 --> 01:24:21,039
Hello?

616
01:24:21,074 --> 01:24:22,339
Yes?

617
01:24:25,299 --> 01:24:27,099
Is Carson Wells there?

618
01:24:29,419 --> 01:24:31,619
Not in the sense that you mean.

619
01:24:33,939 --> 01:24:35,979
You need to come see me.

620
01:24:36,219 --> 01:24:37,859
Who is this?

621
01:24:38,338 --> 01:24:39,818
You know who it is.

622
01:24:41,098 --> 01:24:43,018
You need to talk to me.

623
01:24:43,258 --> 01:24:44,538
I don't need to talk to you.

624
01:24:44,573 --> 01:24:45,778
I think you do.

625
01:24:46,738 --> 01:24:48,938
Do you know where I'm going?

626
01:24:49,298 --> 01:24:51,458
Why would I care where you're going.

627
01:24:51,498 --> 01:24:53,498
I know where you are.

628
01:24:54,018 --> 01:24:56,058
Yeah? Where am I?

629
01:24:56,098 --> 01:24:58,138
You're in a hospital across the river.

630
01:24:58,178 --> 01:25:03,138
But that's not where I'm going.
Do you know where I'm going?

631
01:25:05,458 --> 01:25:07,098
Yeah. I know where you're going.

632
01:25:07,138 --> 01:25:08,698
Alright.

633
01:25:09,338 --> 01:25:11,183
You know she won't be there.

634
01:25:11,218 --> 01:25:13,418
It doesn't make any difference where she is.

635
01:25:13,458 --> 01:25:15,337
So what're you going up there for?

636
01:25:19,417 --> 01:25:22,017
You know how this is going
to turn out, don't you?

637
01:25:23,777 --> 01:25:25,057
No.

638
01:25:26,177 --> 01:25:29,937
I think you do too. So
this is what I'll offer.

639
01:25:30,777 --> 01:25:33,257
You bring me the money and I'll let her go.

640
01:25:34,217 --> 01:25:38,017
Otherwise she's accountable. Same as you.

641
01:25:40,177 --> 01:25:42,537
That's the best deal you're going to get.

642
01:25:42,577 --> 01:25:46,777
I won't tell you you can save
yourself because you can't.

643
01:25:49,936 --> 01:25:52,096
Yeah, I'm going to bring you somethin' alright.

644
01:25:53,336 --> 01:25:55,856
I've decided to make you
a special project of mine.

645
01:25:55,896 --> 01:25:57,856
You ain't goin' to have
to come look for me at all.

646
01:26:02,736 --> 01:26:04,736
- The motel in Del Rio?
- Yessir.

647
01:26:05,216 --> 01:26:07,256
None of the three had ID on 'em...

648
01:26:07,296 --> 01:26:09,136
...but they're telling me
that all three is Mexicans.

649
01:26:09,816 --> 01:26:10,616
Was Mexicans.

650
01:26:10,776 --> 01:26:15,576
There's a question. Whether
they stopped it? And when?

651
01:26:17,576 --> 01:26:19,096
Yessir.

652
01:26:19,736 --> 01:26:22,176
Now, Wendell, did you inquire
about the lock cylinder?

653
01:26:22,216 --> 01:26:25,055
- Yessir. It was punched out.
- Okay.

654
01:26:26,295 --> 01:26:27,535
You wanna drive out there?

655
01:26:27,575 --> 01:26:31,575
No, that's all I've to look for and it sounds
like these old boys died of natural causes.

656
01:26:31,975 --> 01:26:33,020
How's that, Sheriff?

657
01:26:33,055 --> 01:26:35,295
Natural to the line of work they was in.

658
01:26:35,330 --> 01:26:36,295
Yessir.

659
01:26:36,335 --> 01:26:40,135
My god, Wendell, it's just all-out war.
I can't think of any other word for it.

660
01:26:40,175 --> 01:26:42,375
Who are these people?

661
01:26:42,615 --> 01:26:45,140
Here last week they found this couple out...

662
01:26:45,175 --> 01:26:47,775
...in California, they'd
rent out rooms to old people.

663
01:26:47,815 --> 01:26:52,455
Kill 'em, bury 'em in the yard and
cash their social security checks.

664
01:26:53,215 --> 01:26:56,895
They'd torture them first. I don't know why.

665
01:26:57,735 --> 01:27:00,215
Maybe their television set was broke.

666
01:27:00,535 --> 01:27:03,094
And this went on until, and here I quote:

667
01:27:04,374 --> 01:27:09,214
Neighbors were alerted when a man ran from
the premises wearing only a dog collar.

668
01:27:10,934 --> 01:27:14,534
You can't make up such a thing
as that. I dare you to even try.

669
01:27:14,574 --> 01:27:17,814
But that's what it took, you'll
notice. Get somebody's attention.

670
01:27:17,854 --> 01:27:21,094
Digging graves in the back
yard didn't bring any.

671
01:27:28,174 --> 01:27:30,614
That's all right. I laugh myself sometimes.

672
01:27:33,134 --> 01:27:35,534
There ain't a whole lot else you can do.

673
01:27:38,013 --> 01:27:39,333
Tell me something.

674
01:27:39,733 --> 01:27:42,613
Who do you think gets through this
gate into the United States of America?

675
01:27:44,533 --> 01:27:47,093
I don't know. American citizens?

676
01:27:47,373 --> 01:27:49,733
Some American citizens.
Who do you think decides?

677
01:27:49,973 --> 01:27:53,213
- Well, you do, I reckon.
- That is correct. How do I decide?

678
01:27:54,093 --> 01:27:55,973
- I don't know.
- I ask questions.

679
01:27:56,013 --> 01:28:00,133
And if I get sensible answers then they get to go to
America. If I don't get sensible answers they don't.

680
01:28:00,173 --> 01:28:02,173
- Anything about that you don't understand?
- No sir.

681
01:28:02,213 --> 01:28:05,013
Then I ask you again. How you come
to be out here with no clothes?

682
01:28:06,453 --> 01:28:08,333
I got an overcoat on.

683
01:28:09,213 --> 01:28:11,013
- Are you jackin' with me?
- Oh, no sir.

684
01:28:11,053 --> 01:28:12,812
- Don't jack with me.
- Yes sir.

685
01:28:13,732 --> 01:28:16,012
- Are you in the service?
- No sir. I'm a veteran.

686
01:28:16,047 --> 01:28:18,412
- Nam?
- Yes sir. Two tours.

687
01:28:18,452 --> 01:28:19,612
What outfit?

688
01:28:19,652 --> 01:28:25,252
Twelfth Infantry Battalion.
August 7th 1966 to July 2nd 1968.

689
01:28:27,372 --> 01:28:29,092
- Wilson!
- Yessir.

690
01:28:31,012 --> 01:28:33,812
Get someone to help this man.
He needs to get into town.

691
01:28:42,972 --> 01:28:46,412
- How those Larries holdin' up?
- Oh, good.

692
01:28:46,452 --> 01:28:49,211
- I need everything else.
- Okay.

693
01:28:50,371 --> 01:28:52,931
You have a lot of people come
in here without any clothes on?

694
01:28:52,971 --> 01:28:55,331
No sir, it's unusual.

695
01:29:08,891 --> 01:29:10,251
She don't want to talk to you.

696
01:29:10,291 --> 01:29:11,611
Yes she does. Put her on.

697
01:29:11,651 --> 01:29:13,051
Do you know what time it is?

698
01:29:13,451 --> 01:29:15,731
I don't care what time it is.
And don't you hang up this phone.

699
01:29:21,011 --> 01:29:22,771
- Llewelyn.
- Hey you.

700
01:29:23,051 --> 01:29:26,010
- What should I do?
- You know what's goin' on?

701
01:29:26,250 --> 01:29:29,770
I don't know, I had the sheriff
here from Terrell County.

702
01:29:29,810 --> 01:29:31,170
What did you tell him?

703
01:29:31,370 --> 01:29:35,650
What did I know to tell
him? You're hurt, ain't you?

704
01:29:37,370 --> 01:29:39,170
What makes you say that?

705
01:29:39,570 --> 01:29:41,055
I can hear it in your voice.

706
01:29:41,090 --> 01:29:43,250
There is falseness in his voice!

707
01:29:43,570 --> 01:29:46,250
Look, I want you to meet me at
the Desert Sands motel in El Paso.

708
01:29:47,010 --> 01:29:49,490
Cause I'm gonna give you the
money and I'ma put you on a plane.

709
01:29:49,530 --> 01:29:52,095
Llewelyn, I ain't gonna
leave you in the lurch.

710
01:29:52,130 --> 01:29:56,050
No. This works better. With you gone and
I don't have the money, he can't touch me.

711
01:29:56,090 --> 01:29:58,015
But I can sure touch him.

712
01:29:58,050 --> 01:30:00,489
And after I find him I'll come and join you.

713
01:30:00,769 --> 01:30:04,129
Find who? What am I
supposed to do with Mother?

714
01:30:04,169 --> 01:30:06,329
- Nah, she'll be alright.
- She'll be alright?

715
01:30:06,369 --> 01:30:08,889
Be all right?! I've got the cancer!

716
01:30:08,929 --> 01:30:11,409
Ain't nobody's gonna bother her.

717
01:30:45,488 --> 01:30:46,688
Who are you?

718
01:30:51,248 --> 01:30:53,128
- Me?
- Yes.

719
01:30:53,168 --> 01:30:56,688
Nobody. Accounting.

720
01:30:58,688 --> 01:31:01,408
He gave the Mexicans a receiver.

721
01:31:03,568 --> 01:31:08,968
He feels... he felt that...
the more people looking...

722
01:31:09,008 --> 01:31:13,327
That's foolish. You pick the one right tool.

723
01:31:14,647 --> 01:31:20,167
I see. Are you going to shoot me?

724
01:31:26,407 --> 01:31:32,487
That depends. Do you see me?

725
01:31:35,527 --> 01:31:37,967
I always seen this is what it would come to.

726
01:31:38,247 --> 01:31:40,567
Three years ago I pre-visioned it.

727
01:31:40,807 --> 01:31:42,527
It ain't even three years we been married.

728
01:31:42,847 --> 01:31:46,926
Three years ago I said them
very words. No and Good.

729
01:31:47,126 --> 01:31:51,371
Here we are. Ninety degree heat.

730
01:31:51,406 --> 01:31:55,686
I got the cancer. And look at
this. Not even a home to go to.

731
01:31:56,486 --> 01:32:02,446
We're goin' to El Paso Texas. You know
how many people I know in El Paso Texas?

732
01:32:02,486 --> 01:32:05,806
- No ma'am.
- That's how many.

733
01:32:14,606 --> 01:32:17,686
- I didn't see my Prednizone.
- I put it in, Mama.

734
01:32:17,846 --> 01:32:21,205
- Well I didn't see it.
- Well, I put it in. That one.

735
01:32:21,645 --> 01:32:25,285
You just set there. I'll get
tickets and a cart for the bags.

736
01:32:25,685 --> 01:32:27,885
Do you need help with the bags, madam?

737
01:32:28,685 --> 01:32:31,565
Well, thank god there is one
gentleman left in West Texas.

738
01:32:31,845 --> 01:32:34,525
Yes, thank you. I am old and I am not well.

739
01:32:34,845 --> 01:32:39,085
- Which bus are you taking?
- We're going to El Paso. Don't ask me why.

740
01:32:39,365 --> 01:32:42,045
It's not often you see a Mexican in a suit.

741
01:32:42,365 --> 01:32:45,525
You go to El Paso? I know
it. Where are you staying?

742
01:32:46,285 --> 01:32:47,965
Carla Jean, how are you?

743
01:32:48,165 --> 01:32:52,045
Sheriff, was that a true
story about Charlie Walser?

744
01:32:52,245 --> 01:32:53,845
Who's Charlie Walser?

745
01:32:57,324 --> 01:33:01,444
True story? I couldn't swear to ever detail
but it's certainly true that it is a story.

746
01:33:02,284 --> 01:33:02,844
Yeah, right.

747
01:33:04,884 --> 01:33:06,884
Sheriff, can you give me
your word on somethin'?

748
01:33:07,004 --> 01:33:09,044
Yes ma'am?

749
01:33:09,444 --> 01:33:12,129
If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed...

750
01:33:12,164 --> 01:33:14,844
...you promise it'll be just
you goes and talks with him?

751
01:33:15,604 --> 01:33:16,884
You and nobody else.

752
01:33:17,204 --> 01:33:18,924
Yes ma'am, I do.

753
01:33:19,324 --> 01:33:21,364
Llewelyn would never ask for help.

754
01:33:21,804 --> 01:33:23,884
He never thinks he needs any.

755
01:33:24,124 --> 01:33:26,804
Carla Jean, I will not harm your man.

756
01:33:27,884 --> 01:33:31,484
And he needs help, whether he knows it or not.

757
01:33:40,323 --> 01:33:42,203
What's the problem there, neighbor?

758
01:33:43,563 --> 01:33:46,763
That'll suck some power. Over time.

759
01:33:48,683 --> 01:33:52,443
- You from around here?
- Alpine. Born and bred.

760
01:33:52,963 --> 01:33:53,563
Here ya go.

761
01:33:54,123 --> 01:33:59,323
- What airport would you use?
- Well? Airport or airstrip?

762
01:33:59,523 --> 01:34:02,723
- Airport.
- Well, where ya goin'?

763
01:34:03,643 --> 01:34:07,083
- I don't know.
- Just lightin' out for the territories, huh?

764
01:34:07,763 --> 01:34:09,682
Brother, I been there.

765
01:34:10,162 --> 01:34:10,642
Well...

766
01:34:11,282 --> 01:34:14,682
There's airstrips. The airport is El Paso.

767
01:34:15,602 --> 01:34:19,002
You want some place specific you might
could be better off just drivin' to Dallas.

768
01:34:19,882 --> 01:34:20,682
Not have to connect.

769
01:34:22,042 --> 01:34:26,642
- You gonna clamp them, buddy?
- Can you get those chicken crates out of the bed?

770
01:34:27,762 --> 01:34:29,762
What're you talkin' about?

771
01:34:45,761 --> 01:34:50,601
- Hey. Mr. Sporting Goods.
- Hey yourself.

772
01:34:51,681 --> 01:34:52,441
You a sport?

773
01:34:53,761 --> 01:34:55,641
Yeah, that's me.

774
01:34:56,201 --> 01:34:58,041
I got beers in my room.

775
01:35:00,161 --> 01:35:02,081
Waiting on my wife.

776
01:35:02,921 --> 01:35:07,281
- That's who you keep lookin' out the window for?
- Half.

777
01:35:07,321 --> 01:35:11,641
- What else then?
- Just lookin' for what's comin'.

778
01:35:13,081 --> 01:35:15,241
Yeah, but no one ever sees that.

779
01:35:16,281 --> 01:35:18,961
Beer. That's what's comin'.

780
01:35:19,680 --> 01:35:22,160
I'll bring the ice chest out
here. You can stay married.

781
01:35:22,200 --> 01:35:24,680
No ma'am. I know what beer leads to.

782
01:35:26,640 --> 01:35:28,960
Beer leads to more beer.

783
01:36:22,279 --> 01:36:24,359
Call police.

784
01:36:30,279 --> 01:36:31,838
Your local law enforcement.

785
01:36:34,278 --> 01:36:35,478
I'm not on their radio.

786
01:37:26,157 --> 01:37:28,877
Buy you a cup of coffee before you drive home?

787
01:37:29,477 --> 01:37:30,837
No money in his room there?

788
01:37:30,957 --> 01:37:35,477
Couple hundred on his person. Those
hombres would've taken the stash.

789
01:37:35,997 --> 01:37:40,077
I suppose so. Though they
was leavin' in a hurry.

790
01:37:40,437 --> 01:37:43,236
It's all the goddamned money, Ed Tom.

791
01:37:43,556 --> 01:37:45,276
The money and the drugs.

792
01:37:46,476 --> 01:37:49,516
It's just goddamned beyond everything.

793
01:37:49,996 --> 01:37:52,836
What's it mean? What's it leading to?

794
01:37:53,396 --> 01:37:57,996
You know, if you'd a told me twenty
years ago, I'd see children walking...

795
01:37:58,031 --> 01:38:02,596
the streets of our Texas towns with
green hair and bones in their noses.

796
01:38:03,396 --> 01:38:05,316
I just flat out wouldn't of believed you.

797
01:38:05,676 --> 01:38:09,476
Signs and wonders. But I think once
you quit hearin' sir and ma'am...

798
01:38:09,511 --> 01:38:11,356
...the rest is soon to follow.

799
01:38:11,876 --> 01:38:16,156
Oh, it's the tide. It's the dismal tide.

800
01:38:16,436 --> 01:38:18,795
- It is not the one thing.
- Not the one thing.

801
01:38:19,155 --> 01:38:20,915
None of that explains your man though.

802
01:38:22,035 --> 01:38:25,075
He's just a goddamn homicidal lunatic, Ed Tom.

803
01:38:25,315 --> 01:38:28,475
- I'm not sure he's a lunatic.
- Yeah well, what would you call him?

804
01:38:28,795 --> 01:38:32,475
I don't know. Sometimes I
think he's pretty much a ghost.

805
01:38:32,510 --> 01:38:34,355
- He's real all right.
- Oh yeah?

806
01:38:34,555 --> 01:38:38,435
All that at the? Motel.
It's beyond everything.

807
01:38:38,835 --> 01:38:41,075
Yeah, he has some hard bark on him.

808
01:38:41,715 --> 01:38:43,715
That don't hardly say it.

809
01:38:44,675 --> 01:38:46,520
He shoots the desk clerk one day.

810
01:38:46,555 --> 01:38:50,355
Walks right back in the next and
shoots a retired army colonel.

811
01:38:51,075 --> 01:38:52,595
It's hard to believe.

812
01:38:52,795 --> 01:38:55,674
Strolls right back into a crime scene.

813
01:38:56,034 --> 01:39:00,714
Who would do such a thing?
How do you defend against it?

814
01:39:03,114 --> 01:39:04,399
Good trip, Ed Tom.

815
01:39:04,434 --> 01:39:07,034
I'm sorry we couldn't help your boy.

816
01:42:39,188 --> 01:42:40,828
Min back!

817
01:42:41,108 --> 01:42:44,828
- How'd you know I was here?
- Who else'd be driving up your truck?

818
01:42:45,588 --> 01:42:47,228
- You heard it?
- How's that?

819
01:42:47,588 --> 01:42:53,548
- You heard what I'm - you having fun
with me? - What give you that idea?

820
01:42:54,148 --> 01:42:57,348
- I seen one of the cats heard it. -
But - how'd you know it was my truck?

821
01:42:58,188 --> 01:43:01,068
I deduced it. When you walked in.

822
01:43:01,308 --> 01:43:02,907
How many of those things you got now?

823
01:43:02,947 --> 01:43:05,267
Cats? I don't know. Several.

824
01:43:05,987 --> 01:43:08,227
Well, it depends on what you mean by got.

825
01:43:09,027 --> 01:43:12,867
Some of 'em are half-wild, and
some of 'em are just outlaws.

826
01:43:16,387 --> 01:43:19,152
How you been, Ellis?

827
01:43:19,187 --> 01:43:24,787
You lookin' at it. I got
to say you lookin' older.

828
01:43:24,987 --> 01:43:26,467
I am older.

829
01:43:27,627 --> 01:43:29,912
Got a letter from your wife.

830
01:43:29,947 --> 01:43:34,627
She writes to me pretty regular,
keep me up on the family news.

831
01:43:35,267 --> 01:43:38,146
- Didn't know there was any.
- She told me you were quittin'.

832
01:43:41,346 --> 01:43:44,026
- You want a cup?
- 'Preciate it.

833
01:43:51,706 --> 01:43:53,426
How fresh is that coffee?

834
01:43:53,746 --> 01:43:59,106
I generally make a fresh pot ever
week even if there's some left over.

835
01:44:01,386 --> 01:44:04,586
That man who shot you died in prison.

836
01:44:05,946 --> 01:44:07,546
In Angola. Yeah.

837
01:44:08,266 --> 01:44:10,506
What would you a done if he'd been released?

838
01:44:11,346 --> 01:44:15,945
I don't know. Nothin.
Wouldn't be no point to it.

839
01:44:16,585 --> 01:44:19,185
I'm kindly surprised to hear you say that.

840
01:44:19,225 --> 01:44:22,750
Well, all the time you
spend tryin' to get back...

841
01:44:22,785 --> 01:44:26,345
...what's been took from you
more is goin' out the door.

842
01:44:26,745 --> 01:44:30,505
After a while, you just have to
try to get a tourniquet on it.

843
01:44:30,865 --> 01:44:34,705
Your granddaddy never asked
me to sign on as a deputy.

844
01:44:37,625 --> 01:44:40,185
Loretta tells me you're quittin'.

845
01:44:40,625 --> 01:44:42,185
How come're you doin' that?

846
01:44:42,465 --> 01:44:43,985
I don't know.

847
01:44:46,785 --> 01:44:49,105
I feel overmatched.

848
01:44:52,984 --> 01:44:55,344
I always figured when I got older...

849
01:44:55,944 --> 01:45:00,464
...God would sort of come
into my life in some way.

850
01:45:03,544 --> 01:45:05,024
He didn't.

851
01:45:08,424 --> 01:45:10,424
I don't blame him.

852
01:45:12,504 --> 01:45:15,904
If I was him I'd have the same
opinion about me that he does.

853
01:45:16,184 --> 01:45:18,264
You don't know what he thinks.

854
01:45:32,223 --> 01:45:36,343
I sent Uncle Mac's thumbbuster
and badge over to the Rangers.

855
01:45:36,378 --> 01:45:37,343
Put up in a museum.

856
01:45:38,743 --> 01:45:42,503
Your daddy ever tell you how
Uncle Mac come to his reward?

857
01:45:43,303 --> 01:45:46,983
Gunned down on his own porch
over in Hudspeth County.

858
01:45:49,223 --> 01:45:53,783
Seven or eight of 'em come up to
here. Wantin' this and wantin' that.

859
01:45:54,383 --> 01:45:57,263
Uncle Mac went back in the
house and got the shotgun...

860
01:45:57,298 --> 01:46:00,183
They was way ahead of him.

861
01:46:01,342 --> 01:46:03,502
Shot him in the doorway.

862
01:46:03,942 --> 01:46:06,782
Aunt Ella came out and
tried to stop the bleedin'.

863
01:46:06,822 --> 01:46:09,622
Uncle Mac all the while
tryin' to get that shotgun.

864
01:46:10,302 --> 01:46:14,182
They just sat there on their
horses watchin' him die.

865
01:46:15,822 --> 01:46:20,702
After a while, one of 'em says something
in Injun and they all turned and left out.

866
01:46:24,942 --> 01:46:28,782
Well, Uncle Mac knew the
score even if Aunt Ella didn't.

867
01:46:28,822 --> 01:46:31,182
Shot through the left lung.

868
01:46:32,062 --> 01:46:36,381
And that was that. As they say.

869
01:46:39,501 --> 01:46:45,221
- When did he die?
- 1909.

870
01:46:45,461 --> 01:46:51,261
No, I mean was it right away
or in the night or when was it?

871
01:46:51,461 --> 01:46:55,141
I believe it's that night. She
buried him the next mornin'.

872
01:46:55,781 --> 01:46:58,061
Diggin' in that hard old caliche.

873
01:47:01,621 --> 01:47:04,581
What you got ain't nothing new.

874
01:47:05,141 --> 01:47:08,141
This country is hard on people.

875
01:47:11,261 --> 01:47:14,020
You can't stop what's comin'.

876
01:47:15,340 --> 01:47:18,180
Ain't all waitin' on you.

877
01:47:20,340 --> 01:47:22,980
That's vanity.

878
01:48:23,018 --> 01:48:27,698
- I knew this wasn't done with.
- No.

879
01:48:28,378 --> 01:48:32,623
I ain't got the money.

880
01:48:32,658 --> 01:48:36,938
What little I had is long gone and
there's bills aplenty to pay yet.

881
01:48:38,458 --> 01:48:42,818
I buried my mother today. I
ain't paid for that neither.

882
01:48:43,858 --> 01:48:46,178
I wouldn't worry about it.

883
01:48:48,418 --> 01:48:50,818
I need to sit down.

884
01:49:05,417 --> 01:49:07,937
You got no cause to hurt me.

885
01:49:08,297 --> 01:49:11,737
No. But I gave my word.

886
01:49:12,617 --> 01:49:16,737
- You gave your word?
- To your husband.

887
01:49:19,337 --> 01:49:25,337
That don't make sense. You gave
your word to my husband to kill me?

888
01:49:25,617 --> 01:49:28,897
Your husband had the opportunity to save you.

889
01:49:28,932 --> 01:49:32,177
Instead, he used you to try to save himself.

890
01:49:37,176 --> 01:49:43,056
Not like that. Not like you say.

891
01:49:48,496 --> 01:49:50,376
You don't have to do this.

892
01:49:50,696 --> 01:49:52,416
They'll always say the same thing.

893
01:49:54,256 --> 01:49:56,176
What did they say?

894
01:49:56,576 --> 01:49:59,736
They say you don't have to do this.

895
01:50:00,136 --> 01:50:01,696
You don't.

896
01:50:10,175 --> 01:50:12,335
This is the best I can do.

897
01:50:13,455 --> 01:50:15,055
Call it.

898
01:50:19,495 --> 01:50:22,975
I knowed you was crazy when
I saw you sittin' there.

899
01:50:24,855 --> 01:50:27,975
I knowed exactly what was in store for me.

900
01:50:28,495 --> 01:50:31,015
- Call it.
- No.

901
01:50:32,455 --> 01:50:34,455
I ain't gonna call it.

902
01:50:37,895 --> 01:50:42,055
- Call it.
- The coin don't have no say.

903
01:50:42,575 --> 01:50:44,855
It's just you.

904
01:50:47,254 --> 01:50:50,734
Well, I got here the same way the coin did.

905
01:52:33,051 --> 01:52:36,211
Mister, there's a bone
stickin' out of your arm.

906
01:52:36,531 --> 01:52:38,411
I'm alright. Let me just sit here a minute.

907
01:52:38,731 --> 01:52:41,651
There's an ambulance comin'.
Man over yonder went to call.

908
01:52:41,891 --> 01:52:43,291
Alright.

909
01:52:43,971 --> 01:52:47,771
Are you all right? You got a
bone stickin' out of your arm.

910
01:52:48,771 --> 01:52:51,091
What will you take for that shirt?

911
01:52:56,051 --> 01:52:58,891
Hell mister, I'll give you my shirt.

912
01:53:05,971 --> 01:53:08,730
Look at that fuckin' bone.

913
01:53:08,930 --> 01:53:10,850
Tie this for me.

914
01:53:11,130 --> 01:53:12,970
Just tie it.

915
01:53:31,370 --> 01:53:35,930
Hell mister. Look, I don't mind helping
someone out. That's a lot of money.

916
01:53:35,970 --> 01:53:41,050
Take it. Take it and you didn't see me.

917
01:53:41,250 --> 01:53:42,770
I was already gone.

918
01:53:43,050 --> 01:53:44,649
Yessir.

919
01:53:48,969 --> 01:53:52,329
- Part of that's mine.
- You still got your damn shirt.

920
01:53:52,369 --> 01:53:55,849
- That ain't what it was for.
- Well maybe, but I'm still out a shirt.

921
01:54:17,169 --> 01:54:19,768
- Maybe I'll go ridin'.
- Okay.

922
01:54:19,968 --> 01:54:23,048
- What do you think?
- I can't plan your day.

923
01:54:24,928 --> 01:54:26,488
I mean, would you care to join me?

924
01:54:26,808 --> 01:54:28,688
Lord no. I'm not retired.

925
01:54:30,488 --> 01:54:32,848
Maybe I'll help out here then.

926
01:54:33,768 --> 01:54:35,448
Better not.

927
01:54:39,208 --> 01:54:42,728
- How'd you sleep?
- I don't know. Had dreams.

928
01:54:42,968 --> 01:54:46,328
Well you got time for 'em
now. Anything interesting?

929
01:54:47,048 --> 01:54:49,768
They always is to the party concerned.

930
01:54:52,248 --> 01:54:55,127
Ed Tom, I'll be polite.

931
01:54:58,327 --> 01:55:01,007
Okay. Two of 'em. Both had
my father. It's peculiar.

932
01:55:02,367 --> 01:55:06,407
I'm older now than he
ever was by twenty years.

933
01:55:06,447 --> 01:55:09,647
So, in a sense he's the younger man.

934
01:55:10,207 --> 01:55:12,452
Anyway, first one I don't
remember too well but...

935
01:55:12,487 --> 01:55:16,967
It was about meeting him in town
someplace where he gave me some money.

936
01:55:17,967 --> 01:55:19,767
I think I lost it.

937
01:55:21,607 --> 01:55:26,007
The second one, it was like we
was both back in older times...

938
01:55:26,647 --> 01:55:30,486
...and I was on horseback goin'
through the mountains of a night.

939
01:55:30,726 --> 01:55:34,046
Goin' through this pass in the mountains.

940
01:55:34,286 --> 01:55:42,926
It was cold and there's snow on the ground. He rode past me and
kept on goin'. Never said nothing goin' by. He just rode on past.

941
01:55:44,526 --> 01:55:48,646
He had his blanket wrapped
around him and his head down.

942
01:55:50,126 --> 01:55:52,166
When he rode past I seen he was...

943
01:55:52,201 --> 01:55:54,166
...carrying fire in a horn...

944
01:55:54,206 --> 01:55:58,526
...the way people used to do and I could
see the horn from the light inside of it.

945
01:55:58,766 --> 01:56:00,566
About the color of the moon.

946
01:56:02,086 --> 01:56:07,290
And in the dream I knew
