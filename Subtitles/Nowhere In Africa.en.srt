1
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:09,611
<i>I couldn't really remember
what Germany was like.</i>

2
00:01:09,945 --> 00:01:12,531
<i>I knew they had snow and seasons...</i>

3
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,533
<i>and our family had lived there.</i>

4
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:17,744
<i>not only Mama and Papa,
but the whole family.</i>

5
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:20,038
<i>And it was nice.</i>

6
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:27,504
<i>But I also remember
that I was always afraid...</i>

7
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:30,007
<i>of other children and people...</i>

8
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:31,550
<i>and even dogs.</i>

9
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:33,427
Watch out!

10
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:41,560
Come here. Let me help you.

11
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:54,448
NOWHERE IN AFRICA

12
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,160
<i>I remember Germany as a dark place.</i>

13
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,370
<i>Not as bright and hot as Kenya.</i>

14
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:03,624
<i>A place with large buildings
and dismal rooms.</i>

15
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,460
<i>Papa always says, "Germany is our home."</i>

16
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:09,171
<i>I</i> think he just misses his father...

17
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:10,839
<i>my grandfather.</i>

18
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:14,468
<i>He couldn't eat cookies with nuts,
because he was allergic.</i>

19
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:17,429
<i>He really liked Heinrich Heine's poems...</i>

20
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:20,098
<i>especially the ones about Germany.</i>

21
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:27,356
<i>I had two aunts in Germany
that I liked an awful lot.</i>

22
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:30,734
<i>Aunt Käthe was Mama's sister.
Papa's sister was Liesel.</i>

23
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:34,321
<i>Sometimes they helped out in Grandpa's
hotel, the "Adler" in Sohrau.</i>

24
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,742
<i>That was in the good old days
before the Nazis came.</i>

25
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:48,877
Can I help you?

26
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,630
No, thank you.

27
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:08,772
We have to go now.

28
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:17,322
<i>The Nazis forbade Papa to work as a
lawyer and took away Grandpa's hotel.</i>

29
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,826
<i>Soon none of our family had a job.</i>

30
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:25,122
<i>When I asked my parents why that was so,
I always got the same answer.</i>

31
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:29,000
<i>"Because we're Jews, Regina. That's why."</i>

32
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,062
What's wrong?

33
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,814
An urgent message!

34
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,259
Walter!

35
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,763
Wake up!

36
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:08,266
- This is quinine. It's good for you.
- Leave me alone!

37
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,101
Come on! Wake up!

38
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,729
Give me the coffee.

39
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:15,524
Hurry!

40
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,197
Good heavens, Walter, wake up!

41
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:39,923
Come on, open your mouth!

42
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:49,891
Breslau, January 1938

43
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:55,772
- Jettel, can I have some apple juice?
- Ask Klara, please.

44
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,362
Anna, I'm glad you could come
despite the snow. Come in.

45
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:05,782
- Good evening, Mrs. Redlich.
- Good evening.

46
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:06,992
Move it!

47
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,411
Don't talk to Jews!

48
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:21,131
Stop playing with those matches!

49
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:24,676
- You're going to burn down the house!
- Sure thing, Klara!

50
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:30,807
Here, a sausage.

51
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,184
You gotta get used to it!

52
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,312
Negroes always eat it black.

53
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,231
- No, they don't.
- Or raw and bloody!

54
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,526
I know they eat dogs
from my geography book.

55
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:44,988
They eat grasshoppers, too. Here, hold him.

56
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:49,868
You wanna go to Africa?
You're even afraid to touch a dachshund.

57
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:51,786
Grandpa!

58
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,334
- Are there nuts in it?
- They're the only cookies I could get.

59
00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:00,921
- Oh, Klara.
- There aren't many nuts in them anyway.

60
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:03,214
- You have to sneeze, right?
- Right.

61
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:07,010
Every time I eat nuts I have to sneeze.
Every darn time.

62
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,515
I really loved the green one.

63
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:17,646
Walter bought me this for New Year's,
but it isn't really my style.

64
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,564
I think it's very elegant.

65
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,191
Then take it.

66
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,696
You're such a sweetheart, Jettel. Thanks.

67
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:30,575
Kéthchen, don't cry today, okay?

68
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:32,577
Do I dare to wear this?

69
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:34,621
It fits your rear end!

70
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,957
- Mrs. Redlich--
- Men like 'em round.

71
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,500
That's for me!

72
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,086
This is for you, Klara!
Glitter is what you need.

73
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,382
Thank you.

74
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,300
What's wrong?

75
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,053
It's from Africa.

76
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,897
<i>Rongai, Kenya, 2 December 1937.</i>

77
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:02,691
<i>My beloved Jettel.</i>

78
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:07,278
<i>I can imagine that this letter
will upset you, so try to be strong.</i>

79
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,156
<i>Last week,
the Jewish community in Nairobi...</i>

80
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:13,243
<i>agreed to pay for your immigration.</i>

81
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,537
<i>After six months here...</i>

82
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:18,707
<i>I'll finally be able
to organize the trip for you and Regina.</i>

83
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:23,545
<i>I beg you not to wait another day.</i>

84
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,505
<i>Go see Karl Silbermann at once.</i>

85
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:27,966
<i>He can help you
with the tickets for the ship.</i>

86
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:32,846
<i>It doesn't matter
what kind of ship or how long it takes.</i>

87
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,305
<i>Just so it takes you.</i>

88
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,727
<i>What we need here is a refrigerator.</i>

89
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:43,023
<i>If it doesn't fit in our chests,
then throw out the Rosenthal china.</i>

90
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:44,899
<i>It's useless here.</i>

91
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:48,570
<i>Also, get kerosene lamps, mosquito nets...</i>

92
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,947
<i>and sturdy shoes for you and Regina.</i>

93
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:54,117
<i>Don't try to bring any cash
or jewelry with you.</i>

94
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:58,663
You know <i>what</i> Nazis <i>do</i> to smugglers.
And say as <i>little</i> as possible.

95
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:00,957
<i>There's no one you can trust...</i>

96
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,918
<i>not even people we called our best friends.</i>

97
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:09,257
<i>Oh, Jettel, my heart wants to burst
at the thought of embracing you two.</i>

98
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:14,220
<i>But it grows heavy imagining how much
this letter will hurt your mother.</i>

99
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:23,229
Walter, you've got malaria.

100
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,108
You have to take this quinine.
It's very important.

101
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:31,362
I have to get back to the farm.
Owuor will take care of you.

102
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,324
He needs the quinine 3 times a day.

103
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,868
3 times 40 drops.

104
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,416
Understand?

105
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:44,918
I understand.

106
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,560
Max, we have to go!

107
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,480
I hate having to say goodbye.

108
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:08,233
I can't stand train stations either.

109
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:14,531
This will all be over in one or two years.

110
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:26,584
So you two are sticking together?

111
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,340
Promise me that you'll stick it out together.

112
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:42,267
One person always loves more.
That's what makes it so difficult.

113
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,147
And the one who loves more is vulnerable.

114
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,322
My son loves you...

115
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,200
very much.

116
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:04,414
I'm going to miss you so much, Max.

117
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:13,256
Mama!

118
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:36,571
Tell her goodbye, please.

119
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:35,713
Eat this.
It will take the fire out of your body.

120
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:39,801
Very good!

121
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:47,350
- Ever heard of the "Silesian Heaven"?
-"Silesian"?

122
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:52,647
Meat, potatoes,
bacon and dried fruit all mixed together.

123
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,693
I don't understand a word!

124
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,908
In my first life I was a lawyer.

125
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:43,132
Owuor, this is for you.

126
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:47,345
- You're giving me your coat?
- It's a robe.

127
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:51,057
I was ill, and you looked after me.

128
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:53,851
I am very grateful to you, Owuor.

129
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:57,688
I wore the robe in my homeland.

130
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,651
I wasn't a bwana there.

131
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,613
I worked with my head.

132
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:11,702
And here you don't want
to wear the robe anymore?

133
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:15,498
You have to be smart to wear a robe.

134
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:18,751
Here in Rongai you're smart. Not me.

135
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:25,633
I'll have to say the word often...

136
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:28,261
so I can pronounce it just like you do.

137
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:32,807
Thank you.

138
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:41,691
<i>We traveled 6 weeks
by steamship around Africa.</i>

139
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:45,778
<i>On 20 April 1938, the Führer's birthday...</i>

140
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:47,405
<i>we arrived in Nairobi.</i>

141
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,449
Regina, take this please.

142
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,369
Mrs. Redlich?

143
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:57,123
<i>Mr. Morrison, who owned the cattle farm
where Papa worked...</i>

144
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,333
<i>picked us up at the train station.</i>

145
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:26,068
<i>It reminded me of chocolate
and what Mama told me on the ship.</i>

146
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:27,653
<i>We were poor now.</i>

147
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:30,740
<i>"So there's no chocolate for poor kids,"
she said.</i>

148
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:33,701
<i>And I had promised to be brave.</i>

149
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,589
Hey, come here!

150
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:51,135
- What did the cow die of?
- We don't have enough water.

151
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:53,554
Shit! It's always the same!

152
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:56,766
You have to dig a well!

153
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,267
Awell!

154
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:16,994
There's a car!

155
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:28,673
Where?

156
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:30,841
Over there!

157
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,255
Everything's all right now.

158
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:10,631
My dearest.

159
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:21,684
Welcome.

160
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,478
Welcome, little memsaab.

161
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:25,980
Come here.

162
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:34,196
Welcome to Rongai!

163
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:52,089
Regina, my girl! Come here!

164
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:56,177
Papa! We traveled by ship,
and we were in England and Morocco...

165
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:57,887
and all over the harbor.

166
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:01,557
I saw dolphins, and Mama danced.

167
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,053
Bwana, he means water.

168
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,902
Tell the man what to do.

169
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:56,404
Yes, bwana.

170
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:47,913
Your father took care of the paperwork,
the refugee tax and everything.

171
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:52,251
We were lucky. In Hamburg they only
opened one chest full of clothes.

172
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,170
Max gave me "Magic Mountain" for you.

173
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:57,465
Thank goodness
the books were in the other chest.

174
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:00,301
I'm sorry, Jettel.

175
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:03,429
I know this isn't what you were expecting.

176
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:05,806
It's lovely.

177
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:10,436
But we can't live here.

178
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:28,913
Not that one!
Don't unpack the patterned china.

179
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,165
We won't be staying here long.

180
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:53,771
Learn German if you want to talk to me.

181
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:55,940
Plate.

182
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,615
Careful!

183
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:43,153
Jettel, my name is Siisskind.

184
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:45,823
Also Walter.

185
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,410
- But everyone calls me Sijsskind.
- I see.

186
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:54,498
Walter is showing Regina the farm.
They'll be back soon.

187
00:22:57,626 --> 00:23:00,754
- Like to have dinner with us?
- Very kind of you. Yes.

188
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:03,591
I just spent four hours
driving through the desert.

189
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:07,052
You'll probably have to
put up with me for the night.

190
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:12,683
I brought you some onions and sugar.

191
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,020
And cigarettes.

192
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,544
Thank you.

193
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:56,101
Thank you.

194
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:00,230
Blessed Sabbath.

195
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,400
I haven't heard the Kiddush for ages.

196
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:06,403
Up to now I've never felt I needed God.

197
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:09,156
If you take quinine every day,
you'll go blind.

198
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:10,866
What about malaria?

199
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:14,036
You can always combat it
if you catch it in time.

200
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:19,208
Here's to the arrival of Jettel and Regina.

201
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:21,001
To our second life.

202
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,253
Cheers.

203
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:30,803
How long have you been away from home?

204
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:32,179
This is my home.

205
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:35,349
Sijsskind was smart enough
to leave Germany in '33.

206
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:37,476
It was easier to leave back then.

207
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:40,479
They let you take all your money, right?

208
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:45,067
- And all your books.
- What about your wife?

209
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,444
Weren't you ever married?

210
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:50,030
No, I wasn't.

211
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,825
- Why not?
- Jettel!

212
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:58,998
It was always my bad luck to fall
in love with women who were already taken.

213
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:06,797
My mother says
someone will have to stop the Nazis.

214
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:11,010
Germany is rich in culture,
the home of Goethe and Schiller.

215
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:15,055
Papa, I think I heard some lions.

216
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:19,601
Nonsense. There aren't any lions around
here. Those are monkeys, baboons.

217
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:23,605
Maybe the lion is just acting like a monkey.

218
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:25,983
You have a great future here.

219
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:28,694
You're already talking like a Negro.

220
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:38,662
"The air is cool and darkling

221
00:25:39,163 --> 00:25:41,081
"And peaceful flows the Rhine

222
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:45,586
"The mountain top is sparkling
The setting sunbeams shine

223
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:49,131
"The fairest maid is reclining
in wondrous beauty there

224
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,508
"Her golden jewels are shining

225
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:53,677
"She combs her golden hair

226
00:25:54,762 --> 00:25:58,182
"With a golden comb she is combing,
and sings a song <i>so</i> free

227
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:01,560
"It casts a spell on the gloaming,
a magical melody

228
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:07,441
"The boatman listens, and o'er him
wild-aching passions roll

229
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:11,361
"He sees but the maiden before him
he sees not reef or shoal

230
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:16,825
"I think, at last the wave swallows
the boat and the boatman's cry

231
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,745
"And this is the fate that follows

232
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:22,039
"The song of the Lorelei"

233
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:24,166
Sleep tight, my angel.

234
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:55,114
You didn't bring the fridge, did you?

235
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:00,953
No, I didn't.

236
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:02,287
Why not?

237
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,499
There was no room in the chests--

238
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:07,960
But enough room
for your floral-patterned china?

239
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:11,755
- There wasn't enough money, anyway.
- What did you do with the money?

240
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:15,884
If you really want to know...

241
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:19,763
I bought this at Wertheim's in Breslau.

242
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:22,141
It cost 45 marks and is beautiful.

243
00:27:25,936 --> 00:27:27,980
You bought an evening gown.

244
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:30,732
Yes.

245
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:44,955
<i>...that he gives...</i>

246
00:27:46,957 --> 00:27:48,417
<i>his name to...</i>

247
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:54,089
<i>...and leaves the mark of his personality...</i>

248
00:27:54,965 --> 00:27:56,717
<i>indelibly on his time...</i>

249
00:27:57,718 --> 00:28:00,053
I never thought I'd be happy
to hear his voice.

250
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:03,557
I'll leave it here so you can stay in touch
with the outer world.

251
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:04,641
And you?

252
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:07,269
- Goodbye.
- We can't accept it.

253
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:10,397
Of course you can. I have another one.

254
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:16,111
Anyway, it'll give me a reason
to stop by now and then...

255
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:19,281
to charge the battery.

256
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:20,949
Do you have to go now?

257
00:28:22,743 --> 00:28:26,914
In this country we should forget
formalities and use the personal "you."

258
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:28,832
Don't you think so?

259
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,797
- Do you have a gun in the house?
- Yes, why?

260
00:28:36,006 --> 00:28:39,551
- Since Jettel and Regina are here.
- Morrison left me one.

261
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,846
Good luck with the well.

262
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,327
Come on, little memsaab!

263
00:29:06,954 --> 00:29:08,538
You see that mountain?

264
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,415
That's Mount Kenya.

265
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:12,209
It's holy.

266
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,629
Mount Kenya.

267
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,967
Come with me, little memsaab.

268
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:25,639
Mama said I wasn't allowed
to go any further than this ridge.

269
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:58,755
Can you help me?

270
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,925
- Memsaab?
- Help me!

271
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:05,929
I'm a cook. Cooks don't dig in the ground.

272
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:12,060
The ground is thirsty.

273
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:15,022
You need more water.

274
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:17,691
Come with me!

275
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:19,985
Water.

276
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:44,926
No men?

277
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:48,305
No, men don't carry water.

278
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,432
That's women's work.

279
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:08,992
Help me! It's so heavy!

280
00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:27,761
Owuor, help me, please!

281
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,014
The water is so heavy.

282
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,225
Help us, too!

283
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,079
Please, give me the shovel!

284
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:14,516
Fire.

285
00:32:17,227 --> 00:32:19,020
Yes, fire.

286
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,818
There's no water in this ground here.

287
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:27,195
- I told you so.
- You were right, Cepoi.

288
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:30,866
I'm sorry.

289
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:36,746
Go home!
And thank you. Thank you very much.

290
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:51,386
6 months later.

291
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:55,265
Why doesn't Owuor ever slaughter
a chicken? Nobody would notice.

292
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:58,393
- Regina, put the doll down.
- We aren't allowed to eat them.

293
00:32:58,602 --> 00:33:01,605
It's our agreement with Morrison.
Only the eggs.

294
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:05,692
I can't stand this muck anymore!
I need meat!

295
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,944
Thank you, Owuor.

296
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:13,617
Fire!

297
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:24,252
You have to look at a fire...

298
00:33:24,461 --> 00:33:26,630
when it has slept for a long time.

299
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:30,884
Don't worry, Jettel.

300
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:34,471
It's just a common bushfire.
It won't reach the house.

301
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:54,491
Where are you going?

302
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:57,827
- To pack! I'm leaving!
- Nonsense!

303
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:00,497
- I can't stand it here any longer!
- You have to.

304
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,082
You always say that!

305
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:05,919
But I want to go home to Mother
and Käthe, to people I understand.

306
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:09,297
You don't earn a thing.
All we eat are eggs and cornmeal.

307
00:34:09,506 --> 00:34:13,593
How can we ever send Regina to school?
She can't always hang around with Owuor!

308
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:16,388
- Damn it! We're alive!
- Yes, we're alive!

309
00:34:17,347 --> 00:34:18,848
But what for?

310
00:34:20,267 --> 00:34:24,187
To hope for rain,
so these cows that aren't ours don't die?

311
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:27,607
My God, I feel like I'm dead,
and sometimes I wish I were!

312
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:31,861
Don't ever say that again!
We just got out in the nick of time.

313
00:34:32,362 --> 00:34:34,322
What are you talking about?

314
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:40,745
Last night the Nazis in Germany burned
down synagogues and looted Jewish shops.

315
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,291
They smashed everything to pieces.

316
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:47,377
People, buildings, stores, everything.

317
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:52,090
How did you find out
on this goddamn farm?

318
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:55,135
From a Swiss radio station this morning.

319
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:05,395
The Nazis no longer see us as humans.

320
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:09,274
Damn it. I saw it coming.

321
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,193
I saw it from the beginning.

322
00:35:13,153 --> 00:35:17,240
Don't you realize that it doesn't matter
when and if Regina learns to read?

323
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:23,788
What about Mama, Käthe...

324
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:26,416
-your father?
- I have no idea!

325
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,586
I kept telling them they had to leave!

326
00:35:47,437 --> 00:35:49,939
<i>10 November 1938.</i>

327
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:51,733
<i>Dear Father.</i>

328
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:56,154
<i>I am very upset about the news
I hear from Germany.</i>

329
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:59,199
<i>People fear that war is inevitable.</i>

330
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:01,451
<i>What do you think?</i>

331
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:05,288
<i>If I only knew how you are doing.</i>

332
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:08,792
<i>If I earned some money,
I'd have you come here.</i>

333
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:12,212
<i>Don't you see any opportunity
to leave Germany?</i>

334
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,297
<i>I beg you...</i>

335
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:16,841
<i>Father...</i>

336
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:19,803
<i>How I long for a conversation with you...</i>

337
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:22,681
<i>for your advice, your sympathy.</i>

338
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:32,691
<i>Being abroad, I have become aware how
blessed I am to have parents like you...</i>

339
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:36,319
<i>and how grateful I am for everything
you did for me.</i>

340
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:41,324
<i>Your money wasn't wasted by allowing me
to study so long after Mother's death.</i>

341
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:46,079
<i>One day your son will certainly be
the lawyer you were always so proud of.</i>

342
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:07,767
Come here, little memsaab.

343
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:26,619
It needs you. It is a child like you.

344
00:37:53,313 --> 00:37:56,900
- It's so cold!
- Do you want to run around like a Negro?

345
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,026
I don't care.

346
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:02,530
I don't have anything against Negroes,
and there aren't any other kids here...

347
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:04,657
but be careful.

348
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:07,076
They have illnesses like malaria and so on.

349
00:38:07,494 --> 00:38:11,039
They are very dirty,
and I don't want you to get sick.

350
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:13,708
A white child is not a black child.

351
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:17,545
And promise you don't eat anything
they give you.

352
00:38:17,754 --> 00:38:19,798
And never enter their huts.

353
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:22,175
So...

354
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,595
Now swallow this.

355
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:30,266
It's too bitter.
And anyway, it'll make me go blind.

356
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:32,268
Nonsense. Open your mouth.

357
00:38:35,939 --> 00:38:37,357
Hey, Mama.

358
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:42,904
There's a ceremony tonight. They'll
slaughter a lamb and ask Ngai for rain.

359
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:46,199
- Ask whom?
- Ngai, their god who lives on the mountain...

360
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,743
Mount Kenya, and the fig tree, too.

361
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,663
They're asking him for rain.
It's a big ceremony.

362
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:53,498
You're not going.

363
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:55,875
They're asking Ngai for rain.

364
00:38:56,084 --> 00:38:58,670
Could you tell me
why you always repeat everything?

365
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,213
Do the Negroes do that, too?

366
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:02,090
You can't repeat good things enough.

367
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:03,967
- Who says?
- Everyone.

368
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,386
- Everyone?
- You can't repeat good things enough.

369
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:09,264
My God, Regina!
What should I do with you?

370
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:12,892
- Remember Grandma?
- What?

371
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:14,602
She always said:

372
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:18,231
"Don't worry about Regina.
She has the luck of a Gentile."

373
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:22,694
Exactly...

374
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:25,154
the luck of a Gentile.

375
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:27,323
That's what Grandma always said.

376
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:30,451
So you don't have to worry, Mama.

377
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:33,037
My angel. I'm so afraid
something might happen to you.

378
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:35,999
Don't worry. It's nice here.

379
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:39,669
Toto! Toto!

380
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:31,656
Memsaab!
Bwana has gone out with the big gun!

381
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:58,433
Kill it.

382
00:42:03,563 --> 00:42:06,315
I can't do it! You see that I can't!

383
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:12,447
I just wanted you to have your damn meat!

384
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:25,918
They don't want anything?

385
00:42:26,586 --> 00:42:29,714
No. They said they're not hungry.

386
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:48,816
Good night.
I don't mind if you go on reading.

387
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:50,693
I've read this book 3 times!

388
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:53,821
Who cares if I read it a fourth time!

389
00:42:54,197 --> 00:42:55,490
Regina.

390
00:42:58,618 --> 00:43:02,955
I didn't expect you to be able to hunt.
I couldn't have done it either.

391
00:43:03,164 --> 00:43:04,957
You never killed an animal before.

392
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:09,295
But I want to! I'm warning you,
don't treat me like a loser!

393
00:43:09,504 --> 00:43:12,173
Did I? I didn't ask you to go hunting!

394
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:15,468
You act like I'm a leper!

395
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:17,095
You've changed.

396
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:21,974
The hell I have! Truth is, you only let
me under your skirt when I'm a lawyer!

397
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:25,436
I got no chance in the desert,
unshaved and sweaty.

398
00:43:25,645 --> 00:43:28,397
- Watch your tongue!
- I'm your husband!

399
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:31,734
I can tell you what I think,
even if you don't like it!

400
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:34,612
You have no right to a privileged life!

401
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:40,576
We've just been lucky up to now.

402
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:44,872
Stop playing the spoiled daughter,
and wake up to what's going on here!

403
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:46,958
Where are you going?

404
00:43:47,834 --> 00:43:49,085
To the bar.

405
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:52,839
But now that we've brought it up,
the way you treat Owuor...

406
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:54,966
reminds me of some people in Germany...

407
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:57,468
to whom you certainly
don't want to be compared!

408
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:34,088
It's nice and warm.

409
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,424
Yeah, nice and warm.

410
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:47,643
Hey, little dog. Where did you come from?

411
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:55,568
- Cepoi, whose dog is this?
- This dog has no home.

412
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:58,446
It's a wild dog. It comes from the huts.

413
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:04,535
Daddy, this dog has no home.
Can I keep him, please?

414
00:45:04,744 --> 00:45:07,496
- But you're afraid of dogs.
- No, not here.

415
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:11,751
Yes, I like him. We'll keep him.

416
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:16,505
We'll call him Rummler,
like the Nazi chairman in Leobschiitz.

417
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:19,133
- Rummler is a nice name.
- Exactly.

418
00:45:19,592 --> 00:45:21,844
Every day we can say,
"Rummler, you bastard"...

419
00:45:22,053 --> 00:45:23,971
and nobody will arrest us.

420
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:28,911
The trucks! They're driving fast!

421
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:41,799
Siisskind!

422
00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:46,095
- What does it mean?
- Don't you listen to the radio?

423
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:48,931
War has broken out. We're being interned.

424
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:51,726
You don't think I'll leave Jettel
and Regina here!

425
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:52,810
Don't worry.

426
00:46:53,019 --> 00:46:57,231
The British are reliable.
They're taking us to Nairobi.

427
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:01,193
- Tell me I have nothing to fear.
- You have my word of honour.

428
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:06,073
I'm not going away!

429
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:14,248
Owuor! Take care of the two!

430
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:16,000
Yes, bwana. I will.

431
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:39,815
May I take this, too?

432
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:42,985
No, only one thing.
Either the bear or the doll.

433
00:47:53,913 --> 00:47:55,831
Don't forget your passport.

434
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,875
- You speak German?
- Yes.

435
00:47:59,502 --> 00:48:01,212
My mother is German.

436
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:06,175
Don't cry, little memsaab!

437
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:09,762
I'll find you everywhere, and follow you.

438
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:11,806
Promise?

439
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:15,559
Promise. I'll catch a new Toto for you.

440
00:48:15,935 --> 00:48:18,020
No, I don't want a new Toto.

441
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:23,526
I didn't protect him very well.
His mother should have looked after him.

442
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:27,029
I'm not a good mother for an antelope baby.

443
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:30,533
You're wise, little memsaab.

444
00:48:33,661 --> 00:48:35,621
Take care of our things!

445
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:38,499
Goodbye, Owuor! Goodbye, Rummler!

446
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:12,074
Suddenly, we were no longer refugees,
but enemy aliens.

447
00:49:12,283 --> 00:49:15,870
We really didn't know why
the British wanted to lock us up.

448
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:18,956
We were Germans,
and England and Germany were at war...

449
00:49:19,165 --> 00:49:22,626
but, after all, we were Jews
who certainly didn't side with Hitler.

450
00:50:29,944 --> 00:50:32,154
What a nice prison, Mama.

451
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:06,063
- Do you understand all this?
- No.

452
00:51:08,232 --> 00:51:10,943
They probably didn't know where to put us.

453
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:16,532
- I bet that's a plum pudding.
- What's that?

454
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,701
Something English.

455
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:45,644
This reminds me of better times.

456
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:50,024
- In the end we'll have to pay for this.
- The chef worked on a luxury liner.

457
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:52,985
- We can't help it.
- I'm really hungry!

458
00:51:56,155 --> 00:51:57,197
No, thanks.

459
00:51:58,324 --> 00:51:59,408
No, thanks.

460
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:11,629
In Breslau, we were always going
to dinner parties and receptions.

461
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:17,426
I tell you, it was such a nice life.

462
00:52:18,302 --> 00:52:21,138
Before emigration every jerk was a prince.

463
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:27,269
Are you finished? Thank you.

464
00:52:43,911 --> 00:52:45,788
No message for your husband?

465
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:53,629
It's the feeling of being alone...

466
00:52:54,088 --> 00:52:56,882
of knowing
that you really have nothing to say...

467
00:52:57,341 --> 00:53:01,637
nothing to share but the time you spend
together, and a child maybe.

468
00:53:02,638 --> 00:53:05,766
It's a painful realization.
You know what I mean?

469
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,935
Oh, well.

470
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:11,271
Being alone is one thing.
I know all about it.

471
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:14,733
But with a woman like Jettel...

472
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:17,152
such a beautiful woman...

473
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:20,030
So cheerful and full of life.

474
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:24,326
Maybe you aren't giving her a real chance.

475
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:29,915
Back in Leobschijtz everything was fine.
We both played our parts.

476
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:32,376
You see.

477
00:53:33,794 --> 00:53:35,754
She won't accept reality.

478
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:39,633
I want a mature woman I can talk to.

479
00:53:42,261 --> 00:53:45,431
I have to cope with everything, too.
My father, Liesel...

480
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:48,058
Will you shut up!

481
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:04,908
Sometimes I think we're like two packages.

482
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:09,747
All tied up, lying in a train...

483
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:14,001
which is taking us to an unknown address.

484
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:19,131
We travel a long way together,
but we don't really know what's inside.

485
00:54:20,466 --> 00:54:22,176
You worry too much.

486
00:54:23,552 --> 00:54:25,679
Perhaps. Sleep well.

487
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:44,782
<i>After a few weeks,
the hotel wanted to get rid of us.</i>

488
00:54:45,491 --> 00:54:49,495
<i>Every day we wandered with our mothers
from one shady spot to the next...</i>

489
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:51,830
<i>wondering about
what we were having for dinner.</i>

490
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:55,751
If only we could go out for a walk.
I'm going crazy in here.

491
00:54:56,752 --> 00:55:00,005
If my husband were interned,
I'd fight to have him released...

492
00:55:00,214 --> 00:55:02,466
instead of sitting here complaining.

493
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:05,344
- But how?
- Mama, I'm hungry!

494
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:08,430
- Hey, you greedy little pig.
- You're all Jews.

495
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:12,434
Why don't you write a letter
to your community in Nairobi?

496
00:55:12,643 --> 00:55:15,062
Jews here have influence, don't they?

497
00:55:15,521 --> 00:55:16,939
That'd be the first time.

498
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:19,066
Can anyone speak English?

499
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:20,359
I can.

500
00:55:21,527 --> 00:55:24,696
<i>The Jewish community had no problem
convincing the British...</i>

501
00:55:24,905 --> 00:55:27,783
<i>that not every German sided with Hitler.</i>

502
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:31,703
<i>Two weeks later, we were allowed
to visit the men at the internment camp.</i>

503
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:35,165
<i>Wearing khakis, it was nearly impossible
to distinguish...</i>

504
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:38,126
<i>between our imprisoned fathers
and the British soldiers.</i>

505
00:55:53,058 --> 00:55:56,228
Papa, I have a girlfriend, a real girlfriend!

506
00:55:56,436 --> 00:55:58,772
Her name is Inge. And she can read.

507
00:55:58,981 --> 00:56:00,816
And Mama wrote a letter.

508
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:02,359
A letter?

509
00:56:02,568 --> 00:56:05,112
So we could visit you.

510
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:21,503
- You wrote a letter to the British?
- Not just me. All the women.

511
00:56:22,004 --> 00:56:24,923
- Maybe we can return to Rongai soon?
- What's changed your mind?

512
00:56:25,132 --> 00:56:28,760
You were desperately unhappy there.
Like something to drink?

513
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:33,348
- They all want to go back to their farms.
- I see.

514
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:45,110
- We can't return to Rongai.
- What?

515
00:56:45,569 --> 00:56:48,113
Morrison fired me because of the war.

516
00:56:48,572 --> 00:56:50,782
He doesn't want an enemy alien on his farm.

517
00:56:50,991 --> 00:56:52,451
What does that mean?

518
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:55,746
I'm out of work, and we have no home.

519
00:57:05,047 --> 00:57:08,133
We'll have to pick up our things at the farm.

520
00:57:09,009 --> 00:57:11,553
Maybe he's still waiting for us...

521
00:57:11,762 --> 00:57:14,181
because he thinks that we're coming back.

522
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:16,058
Maybe Papa will see Owuor.

523
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:19,561
- And he'll bring him here.
- Of course.

524
00:57:20,729 --> 00:57:22,064
Of course.

525
00:58:01,687 --> 00:58:03,605
Could I be of assistance?

526
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:06,900
Yes, please. I need a "special permission."

527
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:11,363
I have to leave the premises for a few
hours to meet Mr. Edward Rubens...

528
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:14,783
the head of the Jewish community
in Nairobi. It's urgent.

529
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:27,421
My husband and I were in Berlin...

530
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:30,632
in '36 for the Olympics.

531
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:34,594
That was our last time in Germany.
My God, we were naive!

532
00:58:34,803 --> 00:58:38,557
It was no different with us.
We believed to the bitter end...

533
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:41,935
No, thanks.
That our civilized friends would stop Hitler.

534
00:58:42,144 --> 00:58:43,103
<i>Friends'?</i>

535
00:58:44,271 --> 00:58:46,356
The Germans were never friends
to the Jews.

536
00:58:46,565 --> 00:58:47,566
I don't agree.

537
00:58:47,983 --> 00:58:50,652
Where are your "friends" now? And in '33?

538
00:58:50,861 --> 00:58:54,656
- Without Hitler--
- Hitler didn't invent anti-Semitism.

539
00:59:00,245 --> 00:59:01,788
How can we be of assistance?

540
00:59:02,289 --> 00:59:04,791
Mr. Morrison, the owner of our farm...

541
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,169
won't employ any enemy aliens.

542
00:59:07,461 --> 00:59:10,213
But without work,
Walter can't leave the camp...

543
00:59:10,422 --> 00:59:12,758
and we don't know
where to find a job for him.

544
00:59:13,175 --> 00:59:15,343
So, I ask you to help us again.

545
00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:17,763
We'd do everything to be good farmers.

546
00:59:18,764 --> 00:59:20,599
And that's why you've come to me?

547
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:24,936
You think you're the only people
to suffer from this stupid war?

548
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:29,608
You think we're responsible for you,
because we let you enter this country?

549
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:33,361
You're alive! You're here!
My God! Make something out of it!

550
00:59:42,788 --> 00:59:45,415
We have relatives in Europe, in Poland.

551
00:59:46,124 --> 00:59:49,044
My husband hasn't heard from them
for months.

552
00:59:49,503 --> 00:59:51,213
Sorry to hear that.

553
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:59,638
- Thank you. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

554
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:44,724
What are you doing here?

555
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:47,435
Was your little outing successful?

556
01:00:55,569 --> 01:00:57,320
What do you mean?

557
01:01:01,283 --> 01:01:04,619
You're looking for a job
on a farm for your husband?

558
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:09,291
I have a friend here in the army.

559
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:11,793
He needs someone.

560
01:01:15,297 --> 01:01:17,007
I could talk to him.

561
01:01:22,179 --> 01:01:24,431
That would be very nice of you.

562
01:01:52,209 --> 01:01:54,419
- Come on.
- I tagged you!

563
01:01:55,295 --> 01:01:56,671
Catch me!

564
01:02:06,264 --> 01:02:09,768
Where have you been? A letter for you.

565
01:02:10,602 --> 01:02:12,354
It looks quite important.

566
01:02:16,691 --> 01:02:18,693
Darn it! How do you say "morgen"?

567
01:02:18,902 --> 01:02:21,279
My gosh, Jettel! It's "tomorrow"!

568
01:02:22,614 --> 01:02:24,241
Try to remember that!

569
01:02:27,077 --> 01:02:29,079
You see? You got it!

570
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:39,172
Oh, Regina!

571
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:42,175
Walter!

572
01:02:43,093 --> 01:02:44,886
- How did you manage it?
- What?

573
01:03:03,989 --> 01:03:05,699
Here we are, Owuor!

574
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:24,092
The holy mountain
looks like a Chinaman's hat.

575
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:27,387
Get down from there!
You're going to break your neck!

576
01:03:28,013 --> 01:03:31,266
This is the most beautiful place
in the whole world!

577
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:37,063
Thank you.

578
01:03:40,525 --> 01:03:42,152
Siisskind, I'm afraid.

579
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:43,611
Afraid of what?

580
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:46,698
This place is further away
from your farm than Rongai.

581
01:03:46,906 --> 01:03:49,242
You can hardly ever visit us.

582
01:03:49,451 --> 01:03:51,453
I'd drive 20 miles more to see you.

583
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:52,829
Promise?

584
01:03:53,997 --> 01:03:56,416
I'll be here more often than you like.

585
01:04:12,766 --> 01:04:15,727
At least we've gotten rid
of those damn cattle.

586
01:04:19,397 --> 01:04:21,316
Are you doing all right?

587
01:04:24,027 --> 01:04:27,364
- I'm your bwana, and I order you...
- Well, bwana?

588
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:30,825
-...to take off your blouse.
- Are you meshuga, or what?

589
01:04:31,409 --> 01:04:33,953
If you do you'll get a fried chicken.

590
01:04:41,586 --> 01:04:45,340
And now you have to walk down the path
like an African woman.

591
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:05,193
Hey! Did you miss me in your hotel?

592
01:05:05,652 --> 01:05:07,487
Ouch! What are you doing?

593
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:39,936
Good morning.

594
01:05:44,983 --> 01:05:47,735
My name is Walter Redlich.

595
01:05:50,155 --> 01:05:52,031
I'm the new bwana here.

596
01:05:55,827 --> 01:05:57,328
You'll need my help.

597
01:05:57,537 --> 01:06:01,040
- I've lived here for 40 years.
- I'd appreciate your help.

598
01:06:10,341 --> 01:06:13,386
- Is Bwana Gibson dead?
- No.

599
01:06:13,928 --> 01:06:17,182
Bwana Gibson can't be here.
He's serving in the Royal Army.

600
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:19,392
He asked me to run his farm.

601
01:06:19,851 --> 01:06:21,394
Show me what to do.

602
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:23,605
You aren't a British bwana?

603
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:26,941
No, I didn't come here to get rich.

604
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:30,236
I came here because I was chased
out of my own country.

605
01:06:31,362 --> 01:06:33,740
- What country are you from?
- Germany.

606
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:36,534
It is far away from here. It is at war.

607
01:06:40,497 --> 01:06:43,249
If someone steals your cow...

608
01:06:43,458 --> 01:06:45,877
it will be killed and eaten.

609
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:48,755
And you can forget it.

610
01:06:49,172 --> 01:06:52,592
But if someone steals your land,
it is always there.

611
01:06:52,967 --> 01:06:56,137
You can visit it. It will always be there.

612
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:58,640
You can never forget it.

613
01:07:36,177 --> 01:07:38,721
Daji Jiwan is Indian. He's a good Fundi.

614
01:07:39,222 --> 01:07:41,224
He can help you build the house.

615
01:07:42,642 --> 01:07:44,769
When you work for me you will get maize...

616
01:07:44,978 --> 01:07:48,106
firewood, 2 liters of milk a day
and 12 shillings a month.

617
01:07:48,314 --> 01:07:50,358
12 shillings aren't much.

618
01:07:50,858 --> 01:07:54,696
I don't bargain. If you don't want
to work, someone else will, Daji.

619
01:08:00,535 --> 01:08:04,122
- These men can't build a house for you.
- I'll teach them.

620
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:22,098
Bwana, Kania is my brother.
We can sweep the floors.

621
01:08:22,307 --> 01:08:25,685
Can Kania cook, too? We need a cook.

622
01:08:25,893 --> 01:08:30,356
No, Kania isn't a cook.
Kania can sweep the floors.

623
01:08:32,358 --> 01:08:34,569
Kamau can cook for the dog.

624
01:08:34,861 --> 01:08:37,030
For what dog? We don't have a dog.

625
01:08:43,286 --> 01:08:45,663
Yes or no?

626
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:47,707
It's very expensive!

627
01:08:50,335 --> 01:08:52,253
I've come for the mail.

628
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:16,110
Letters with this stamp always bring tears.

629
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:18,071
I will give it to bwana.

630
01:09:18,529 --> 01:09:20,948
That's good. You are his friend.

631
01:09:27,664 --> 01:09:30,625
<i>Sohrau, 2 October 1940.</i>

632
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:32,293
<i>My dear son.</i>

633
01:09:33,127 --> 01:09:37,256
<i>It's wonderful to hear about
your good fortune with the second farm.</i>

634
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:40,301
<i>For us it's impossible to emigrate now.</i>

635
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:43,513
<i>Hitler will be closing the borders soon.</i>

636
01:09:44,305 --> 01:09:47,517
<i>Anyway, we have nothing left
that we could sell for cash.</i>

637
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:51,396
<i>They say that the Jews
are going to be taken to ghettos.</i>

638
01:09:51,604 --> 01:09:56,192
<i>If that happens, I'll have Grescheck
send you our new address immediately.</i>

639
01:09:57,860 --> 01:10:01,698
<i>Walter, I'm afraid
for the first time in my life.</i>

640
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:04,325
<i>Afraid...</i>

641
01:10:04,742 --> 01:10:07,286
<i>for Liesel, but also for myself.</i>

642
01:10:10,915 --> 01:10:14,502
<i>We feel like our old Germany
is a desert island.</i>

643
01:10:14,919 --> 01:10:17,839
<i>Hardly anyone dares to talk to us.</i>

644
01:10:18,423 --> 01:10:19,841
<i>It is horrible.</i>

645
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:22,176
<i>My son...</i>

646
01:10:22,552 --> 01:10:26,347
I'm sending <i>you</i> some rose seeds
as you wanted.

647
01:10:27,014 --> 01:10:30,101
<i>May these seeds
sprout in the African earth...</i>

648
01:10:30,643 --> 01:10:32,520
<i>and bring joy to Jettel, you...</i>

649
01:10:33,646 --> 01:10:35,857
<i>and my little Regina.</i>

650
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:38,818
<i>My thoughts are always with you.</i>

651
01:10:39,026 --> 01:10:40,486
<i>Yours, Father.</i>

652
01:10:42,905 --> 01:10:44,991
They've taken a long journey.

653
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:47,910
Yes, a long journey.

654
01:10:54,834 --> 01:10:57,628
I want us to register Regina at school soon.

655
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:59,881
Five pounds a month, we can afford it.

656
01:11:00,089 --> 01:11:03,676
The next time SLisskind goes to Nakuru
he can ask about it.

657
01:11:18,858 --> 01:11:20,067
Rummler.

658
01:11:29,744 --> 01:11:30,828
Owuor?

659
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:38,377
Have you learned to cook?

660
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:44,884
You've found us!

661
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:47,678
Memsaab doesn't have a cook
in OI Joro Orok?

662
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:49,555
No, we don't have a cook.

663
01:11:49,764 --> 01:11:52,016
How did you know?
And how did you find us?

664
01:11:52,225 --> 01:11:55,061
Rummler has a good nose.

665
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:04,821
A bit of flour.

666
01:12:09,242 --> 01:12:10,535
Thank you!

667
01:12:12,537 --> 01:12:14,747
A little boy and a little girl...

668
01:12:15,206 --> 01:12:17,083
are lost in the forest.

669
01:12:17,708 --> 01:12:21,170
They are afraid.
The forest is dangerous at night.

670
01:12:21,796 --> 01:12:24,257
This is an angel. It lives in Heaven.

671
01:12:24,674 --> 01:12:26,843
- And what's this?
- Those are his wings.

672
01:12:27,051 --> 01:12:28,803
He needs them to fly up to Heaven.

673
01:12:29,011 --> 01:12:30,596
Have you ever seen an angel?

674
01:12:30,805 --> 01:12:32,849
No. Angels are invisible.

675
01:12:33,057 --> 01:12:34,892
The ancestors are invisible, too.

676
01:12:35,101 --> 01:12:38,563
Yes. Angels protect us, too,
when we're in danger.

677
01:12:39,897 --> 01:12:43,150
I'm an angel,
and I'll drive away the evil spirits!

678
01:13:03,087 --> 01:13:04,380
Come here!

679
01:13:08,926 --> 01:13:09,927
No!

680
01:13:16,183 --> 01:13:17,518
Yummy, kids!

681
01:13:25,067 --> 01:13:26,152
Come to me!

682
01:13:27,445 --> 01:13:29,196
Go away! Go away!

683
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:50,593
When you come back,
I won't be a child anymore.

684
01:13:50,801 --> 01:13:53,596
Nonsense.
I'll always come home for vacation.

685
01:13:53,804 --> 01:13:56,724
I'll be back for the next maize harvest.

686
01:14:10,488 --> 01:14:12,573
Swear that you'll come back.

687
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:16,619
I swear.

688
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:44,480
I think that's him.

689
01:15:00,204 --> 01:15:02,039
Learn all you can, angel.

690
01:15:04,542 --> 01:15:07,545
Mama, I'll be back for vacation.

691
01:15:07,753 --> 01:15:09,338
I know, my angel.

692
01:15:11,882 --> 01:15:15,011
When I come back,
I'll tell you all about it, Owuor.

693
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:51,088
Come home!

694
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:34,131
We're Jewish. We have to step out.

695
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:11,293
<i>I learned very quickly
what it means to be an outsider.</i>

696
01:17:11,669 --> 01:17:14,296
<i>As Jews, we didn't have to pray...</i>

697
01:17:14,505 --> 01:17:16,924
<i>and we could eat what we liked on Fridays.</i>

698
01:17:17,174 --> 01:17:21,053
<i>Every once in a while a snake fell
on the playing field...</i>

699
01:17:21,303 --> 01:17:23,264
<i>the lost prey of a falcon.</i>

700
01:17:24,348 --> 01:17:26,225
<i>I was happy to have Inge.</i>

701
01:17:26,433 --> 01:17:28,227
<i>She didn't like sports either...</i>

702
01:17:28,435 --> 01:17:31,480
<i>at least not those stupid games
the British played.</i>

703
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:51,292
<i>It's strange how some words
lose their meaning here.</i>

704
01:17:51,792 --> 01:17:54,712
<i>For example, "tax return" or "streetcar."</i>

705
01:17:58,007 --> 01:18:01,427
<i>Sometimes I wonder why
I even get dressed in the morning.</i>

706
01:18:01,635 --> 01:18:05,264
<i>I might as well wear a sack.
Nobody around here would care.</i>

707
01:18:05,472 --> 01:18:06,640
I would.

708
01:18:08,684 --> 01:18:10,644
Do you still find me attractive?

709
01:18:10,978 --> 01:18:12,897
You do have your great moments.

710
01:18:19,612 --> 01:18:21,989
<i>Did you get to know someone in Norfolk?</i>

711
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:26,076
<i>Do you think people
should stay together for their entire life?</i>

712
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:28,078
<i>I guess not.</i>

713
01:18:29,121 --> 01:18:33,375
<i>It's probably just some nonsense which
our ancestors persuaded us to adopt.</i>

714
01:18:36,378 --> 01:18:39,089
<i>If you had your choice, would you leave?</i>

715
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:45,554
<i>I sometimes wonder if there could have
been a happier way of life for me.</i>

716
01:18:45,763 --> 01:18:47,223
<i>Do you understand?</i>

717
01:18:49,016 --> 01:18:51,685
If I'd decided differently at one time.

718
01:18:54,647 --> 01:18:58,567
Listen, I want to make it with you.
I want it to work for us.

719
01:18:58,776 --> 01:19:00,986
You're my wife and I love you!

720
01:19:05,115 --> 01:19:06,909
I miss them all so much...

721
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:09,912
my mother, Kéthe.

722
01:19:12,164 --> 01:19:13,749
It hurts so much!

723
01:23:26,335 --> 01:23:28,670
Well? Isn't that nice, Jogona?

724
01:23:28,879 --> 01:23:30,672
You can't talk to the night.

725
01:23:30,881 --> 01:23:33,634
You're right. You can't talk to the night.

726
01:23:37,554 --> 01:23:40,641
The poet imagined that the night had ears.

727
01:23:41,433 --> 01:23:43,977
It is lovely to make music with words.

728
01:23:45,812 --> 01:23:47,731
Your father is a wise man.

729
01:23:47,940 --> 01:23:50,067
He can talk to the thunder and lightning.

730
01:23:50,275 --> 01:23:53,070
He talks to the ancestors. That's different.

731
01:23:58,283 --> 01:24:01,537
You must take off your blouse,
or it will get dirty.

732
01:24:03,372 --> 01:24:05,082
I won't take off my blouse anymore.

733
01:24:05,290 --> 01:24:07,334
I'm no longer a little child.

734
01:24:07,626 --> 01:24:10,754
You're a stupid child
if you dirty your school blouse.

735
01:24:10,963 --> 01:24:14,675
I'm no longer a child.
You can't see my breasts anymore.

736
01:24:15,175 --> 01:24:18,345
They are no different than the breasts
of the women in the village.

737
01:24:19,304 --> 01:24:23,600
Yes, they are. The breasts of a Mzungus
are different. You can't see them.

738
01:24:23,809 --> 01:24:26,687
The Mzungus' schools
teach very strange things.

739
01:24:27,938 --> 01:24:31,066
Are Mzungus like you
still allowed to climb trees?

740
01:24:37,656 --> 01:24:41,743
Yes. But only when they don't
dirty their school uniform.

741
01:24:51,670 --> 01:24:53,088
Wait, Jogona!

742
01:25:31,710 --> 01:25:33,420
Be careful, Regina!

743
01:25:41,511 --> 01:25:44,139
<i>My dear loved ones, we are very nervous.</i>

744
01:25:45,015 --> 01:25:47,434
We are <i>being</i> sent
to Poland tomorrow to work.

745
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:50,896
<i>Don't forget us. Mother and Kéithe.</i>

746
01:25:51,688 --> 01:25:53,023
What does that mean?

747
01:25:54,399 --> 01:25:57,527
They weren't allowed to write more
than 20 words.

748
01:25:59,529 --> 01:26:01,198
They gave away one.

749
01:26:23,178 --> 01:26:26,807
They are bad days
when Memsaab Kidogo has to go to school.

750
01:26:27,766 --> 01:26:30,268
Maybe they want to leave via Poland.

751
01:26:36,108 --> 01:26:38,318
Maybe they've found a way out.

752
01:26:40,862 --> 01:26:44,658
Say something, Walter! Please! Talk to me!

753
01:26:48,745 --> 01:26:52,708
Your mother wanted you to know.
Or she wouldn't have written it.

754
01:26:54,918 --> 01:26:57,212
- Poland means death.
- No!

755
01:26:58,004 --> 01:27:02,092
You know what?
I envy you for getting this letter...

756
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:05,929
for the certainty!
I have no idea how my father's doing...

757
01:27:08,557 --> 01:27:10,308
where he is...

758
01:27:10,559 --> 01:27:12,018
where my sister is.

759
01:27:22,738 --> 01:27:27,033
<i>Every day the German troops in the East
suffer a new defeat.</i>

760
01:27:27,784 --> 01:27:29,286
<i>German casualties are...</i>

761
01:27:29,494 --> 01:27:31,204
<i>no less significant.</i>

762
01:27:33,165 --> 01:27:36,376
<i>The number of Germans
who have died or been captured...</i>

763
01:27:36,585 --> 01:27:39,254
<i>since the beginning
of the Russian winter offensive...</i>

764
01:27:39,463 --> 01:27:42,215
<i>is now more than 400,000.</i>

765
01:27:59,191 --> 01:28:00,609
What are you doing?

766
01:28:00,942 --> 01:28:03,361
This woman needs no help.
She wants to die.

767
01:28:03,612 --> 01:28:05,947
And her family has left her here?

768
01:28:06,698 --> 01:28:09,075
The hyenas will take away her body
at night.

769
01:28:15,624 --> 01:28:18,210
Kimani, I can't allow this.

770
01:28:20,212 --> 01:28:24,007
I am the memsaab of this farm!
Carry the woman into the house!

771
01:28:24,216 --> 01:28:26,885
If she dies in the hut,
it will no longer be pure.

772
01:28:27,093 --> 01:28:30,263
It would be a great sacrifice
for the family to cleanse it.

773
01:28:32,474 --> 01:28:34,601
It would cost the family a lot of money.

774
01:28:34,935 --> 01:28:37,354
I don't care. It's an order!

775
01:28:37,854 --> 01:28:39,648
As soon as the memsaab is inside...

776
01:28:39,856 --> 01:28:43,193
she will be carried out again.
The woman wants to die outside.

777
01:28:43,527 --> 01:28:45,403
That is what the tradition requires.

778
01:28:45,987 --> 01:28:47,697
It's all right, memsaab.

779
01:28:47,989 --> 01:28:51,910
My mother won't die alone.
The ancestors are with her. She isn't afraid.

780
01:29:19,396 --> 01:29:22,232
If you like, you can be out of here soon.

781
01:29:23,233 --> 01:29:26,903
They call it "Operation J,"
the restructuring of troops in Kenya.

782
01:29:27,112 --> 01:29:29,030
They're really taking Germans?

783
01:29:29,573 --> 01:29:32,617
Jewish men your age stand a chance.

784
01:29:33,159 --> 01:29:36,037
Nobody will accuse them
of siding with Hitler.

785
01:29:36,246 --> 01:29:40,375
But don't be a fool and tell them
you're fed up with farm life...

786
01:29:40,584 --> 01:29:43,837
and you need a change.
They want to hear that you're for the Allies...

787
01:29:44,296 --> 01:29:46,756
and you're ready to fight for the right cause.

788
01:29:50,176 --> 01:29:53,513
- What about Jettel?
- She could live in Nairobi.

789
01:29:55,891 --> 01:29:59,436
I can hardly believe that I'll get
a chance to take part in this war.

790
01:30:01,104 --> 01:30:02,606
What about you?

791
01:30:04,399 --> 01:30:07,903
This isn't my war.
Germany has nothing more to do with me.

792
01:30:28,924 --> 01:30:31,217
- I'm not going with you to Nairobi.
- What?

793
01:30:31,426 --> 01:30:34,971
I'm staying here with Owuor.
I've made up my mind.

794
01:30:35,221 --> 01:30:37,682
Be reasonable.
It's too dangerous here for you.

795
01:30:37,891 --> 01:30:39,517
Leave us your gun.

796
01:30:43,021 --> 01:30:46,149
For the past few years
you've wanted to be somewhere else.

797
01:30:46,358 --> 01:30:50,153
You wanted to return to Germany,
then Rongai. You were never satisfied.

798
01:30:50,362 --> 01:30:54,282
- And now you don't want to leave here.
- I'm not afraid of being alone.

799
01:30:54,491 --> 01:30:58,787
- You'll be among people in Nairobi.
- I don't want to keep following you!

800
01:31:01,665 --> 01:31:04,167
What if something happens to you?

801
01:31:04,376 --> 01:31:08,088
You're the one who should watch out.
They're sending men to Burma.

802
01:31:10,799 --> 01:31:15,220
For the first time in years, I feel
I'm doing something out of conviction.

803
01:31:15,762 --> 01:31:19,474
I can't keep sitting around here.
I feel so useless.

804
01:31:22,602 --> 01:31:25,480
- I understand.
- Then come with me to Nairobi.

805
01:31:28,024 --> 01:31:29,901
I'm staying here with Owuor.

806
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:55,070
If I don't see you for a day, where are you?

807
01:32:55,445 --> 01:32:57,822
I go see my wives and my children.

808
01:32:58,239 --> 01:33:00,200
On the lake. Near Kisumu.

809
01:33:00,450 --> 01:33:02,202
They don't often see you.

810
01:33:03,244 --> 01:33:06,748
They understand that I can't leave
the memsaab alone so often.

811
01:33:16,633 --> 01:33:20,512
- But your wife is always alone.
- That's different.

812
01:33:21,054 --> 01:33:23,556
White women are helpless,
black women are not.

813
01:33:25,683 --> 01:33:27,477
How many children do you have?

814
01:33:27,685 --> 01:33:30,021
I have six children and three wives.

815
01:33:31,272 --> 01:33:32,607
Three wives?

816
01:33:33,149 --> 01:33:36,402
- Then you have a lot to do!
- I bring them my money.

817
01:33:37,695 --> 01:33:41,116
It isn't much. 12 shillings isn't much.

818
01:33:41,366 --> 01:33:44,327
It's enough.
They have shambas with maize and beans...

819
01:33:44,536 --> 01:33:47,122
and fish from the lake.

820
01:33:48,164 --> 01:33:49,499
Do they respect you?

821
01:33:49,707 --> 01:33:50,917
They respect me.

822
01:33:51,292 --> 01:33:53,586
I work in the house of a bwana.

823
01:34:00,343 --> 01:34:02,470
I respect you very much, too.

824
01:34:03,138 --> 01:34:06,516
I don't know what we'd have done
in this country without you.

825
01:34:08,268 --> 01:34:10,186
Will you help me?

826
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:15,275
I'm a cook, not a barber.

827
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:19,779
Please! I can't do it alone.

828
01:34:59,277 --> 01:35:01,029
So your maize fields are fine?

829
01:35:02,197 --> 01:35:05,325
The maize? Yes, it's doing well.

830
01:35:08,745 --> 01:35:10,538
Like to go out for a drive?

831
01:35:11,122 --> 01:35:12,207
Yes.

832
01:35:12,582 --> 01:35:13,833
I'd love to.

833
01:35:14,709 --> 01:35:16,669
Then I'll wait for you outside.

834
01:35:19,380 --> 01:35:21,007
I'm glad you're here.

835
01:35:39,943 --> 01:35:42,070
This country is so beautiful!

836
01:35:43,279 --> 01:35:47,742
The Allies landed on the French coast
with over 300,000 men.

837
01:35:47,951 --> 01:35:50,912
Thank you. So is that good or bad?

838
01:35:51,496 --> 01:35:53,998
Bad for Hitler, so I'd say it's good.

839
01:35:55,917 --> 01:35:58,336
Don't you care what happens in Germany?

840
01:36:00,004 --> 01:36:01,214
And you?

841
01:36:02,924 --> 01:36:05,343
- What's wrong?
- Don't do this to me.

842
01:36:08,846 --> 01:36:10,390
What am I doing?

843
01:36:10,974 --> 01:36:13,184
Come on! It'll be dark in two hours.

844
01:36:28,866 --> 01:36:30,493
You're already here?

845
01:36:31,202 --> 01:36:32,662
I was worried.

846
01:36:35,665 --> 01:36:36,791
Regina!

847
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:41,462
I showed your mother Lake Bogoria.
We were very near your school.

848
01:36:49,220 --> 01:36:52,265
Why are you angry at me?
Because I wasn't here?

849
01:36:53,933 --> 01:36:56,185
Why didn't you go to Nairobi with Papa?

850
01:36:56,394 --> 01:36:59,605
You're asking me?
You're the one who loves this farm!

851
01:37:03,568 --> 01:37:05,653
You don't love him anymore.

852
01:37:07,905 --> 01:37:10,783
Siisskind took me out for a drive. That's all.

853
01:37:12,952 --> 01:37:16,998
Don't you think I was aware of what
happened at the Norfolk?

854
01:37:17,790 --> 01:37:20,251
You had an affair with that soldier.

855
01:37:22,587 --> 01:37:25,006
We organized this farm for us.
We had no home.

856
01:37:25,381 --> 01:37:28,551
I see. What can Sijsskind do for you
when you sleep with him?

857
01:37:56,662 --> 01:37:58,331
Have you seen my child?

858
01:37:58,539 --> 01:38:00,416
The Mzungu child?

859
01:38:00,833 --> 01:38:02,877
- Back there in the hut.
- Thank you.

860
01:38:23,898 --> 01:38:25,858
I'll be right there, Mama.

861
01:38:47,755 --> 01:38:50,299
I've often spent the night
with Jogona and his mother.

862
01:38:50,508 --> 01:38:51,467
Often?

863
01:38:51,676 --> 01:38:54,720
You didn't notice,
because I was home by sunrise.

864
01:38:55,513 --> 01:38:59,016
My wild little girl. Don't disappear like that.

865
01:39:03,438 --> 01:39:07,108
It's so beautiful, Mama.
I understand why you wanted it.

866
01:39:07,567 --> 01:39:11,195
Don't tell Papa. He almost sent me back
to Germany because of that dress.

867
01:39:11,404 --> 01:39:14,657
- And you've never worn it?
- Never.

868
01:39:15,032 --> 01:39:18,744
I was just able to prevent him
from wrapping the meat in it.

869
01:39:19,954 --> 01:39:24,041
Your grandmother and I bought it
in Breslau for 45 marks.

870
01:39:25,293 --> 01:39:28,588
After that we had some cheesecake
at Cafe Mohnheim.

871
01:39:31,799 --> 01:39:34,010
I can't remember Germany at all.

872
01:39:35,178 --> 01:39:38,097
Only when I eat nuts.
Then I think of Grandpa.

873
01:39:43,603 --> 01:39:47,064
Mama, why are the Jews hated?

874
01:39:47,690 --> 01:39:50,902
You and Papa aren't really Jewish.

875
01:39:51,319 --> 01:39:54,780
You eat all kinds of meat,
and you never pray, do you?

876
01:39:54,989 --> 01:39:56,657
Here I do sometimes.

877
01:39:59,535 --> 01:40:02,788
At school they say that the Jews
killed the son of God.

878
01:40:05,708 --> 01:40:08,961
Judaism has never been
so important for Papa and me.

879
01:40:10,087 --> 01:40:12,798
We thought we were as German
as anyone could be.

880
01:40:14,300 --> 01:40:17,720
German culture, the language,
that was home to us.

881
01:40:18,930 --> 01:40:21,807
Maybe we Jews really are different.

882
01:40:22,225 --> 01:40:25,061
Do you remember Aunt Ruth
and Uncle Salomon?

883
01:40:25,269 --> 01:40:26,979
Of course they're different.

884
01:40:27,396 --> 01:40:31,400
They live according to the Jewish religion,
and that makes them different.

885
01:40:31,609 --> 01:40:35,321
Tolerance doesn't mean that everyone
is the same. That'd be stupid.

886
01:40:37,490 --> 01:40:41,536
What I've learned here
is how valuable differences are.

887
01:40:44,956 --> 01:40:46,874
Differences are good.

888
01:40:47,708 --> 01:40:50,878
And intelligent people
will never hold it against you.

889
01:40:54,924 --> 01:40:57,593
The Pokots are celebrating
a big ngoma tonight.

890
01:40:58,052 --> 01:41:01,889
They slaughtered a cow under the holy
tree. There'll be beer and singing.

891
01:41:06,435 --> 01:41:07,853
You have to see it.

892
01:41:08,437 --> 01:41:10,106
It is very "different."

893
01:43:50,933 --> 01:43:52,727
9 May 1945

894
01:44:30,514 --> 01:44:32,558
The war in Germany is over.

895
01:44:43,611 --> 01:44:47,156
A few days ago I got a letter
from a German teacher in Tarnopol.

896
01:44:47,364 --> 01:44:48,991
From whom?

897
01:44:49,366 --> 01:44:50,785
I don't know the man.

898
01:44:51,827 --> 01:44:53,996
He was a teacher before the war.

899
01:44:55,581 --> 01:44:57,458
He knew Father and Liesel.

900
01:45:06,008 --> 01:45:08,052
Father gave him my address.

901
01:45:08,886 --> 01:45:10,721
A week before his death.

902
01:45:21,190 --> 01:45:23,901
Father and Liesel hid
in the basement of a school.

903
01:45:25,402 --> 01:45:29,865
Father was beaten to death
by two SS men on 17 November 1942.

904
01:45:33,452 --> 01:45:37,164
Liesel was taken to Belsec a month later
with the third transport.

905
01:45:37,665 --> 01:45:39,166
Nobody returned.

906
01:45:44,588 --> 01:45:48,217
She got married while fleeing, to a Czech...

907
01:45:49,009 --> 01:45:50,511
Erwin Schweiger.

908
01:45:51,470 --> 01:45:53,222
He was a truck driver.

909
01:47:14,720 --> 01:47:17,556
<i>Wiesbaden, 4 November 1946.</i>

910
01:47:17,806 --> 01:47:19,391
<i>Dear Dr. Redlich.</i>

911
01:47:20,267 --> 01:47:24,355
<i>It is our pleasure to inform you
that your application...</i>

912
01:47:24,563 --> 01:47:29,485
<i>for a position in the Justice Dept.
of Hesse has been accepted.</i>

913
01:47:29,693 --> 01:47:33,280
<i>You will be installed as a Judge
at the Frankfurt District Court.</i>

914
01:47:33,489 --> 01:47:37,201
<i>Your wish to participate in rebuilding
a liberal system ofjustice...</i>

915
01:47:37,409 --> 01:47:40,829
<i>is seen as a sign of hope
for the budding democracy in our state.</i>

916
01:47:41,038 --> 01:47:44,833
<i>While expressing our best wishes
to you and your family...</i>

917
01:47:45,042 --> 01:47:49,546
<i>I remain yours sincerely,
Dr. Erwin Pollitzer...</i>

918
01:47:49,755 --> 01:47:52,341
<i>Department of Justice, Hesse, Germany.</i>

919
01:48:56,697 --> 01:49:00,534
- How did you get here?
- A uniform can work wonders.

920
01:49:01,702 --> 01:49:03,662
Want to see where I sit?

921
01:49:05,205 --> 01:49:07,249
I sit here, and Inge sits there.

922
01:49:07,458 --> 01:49:12,171
And a girl from the 9th grade sits
at the head, a stupid English cow!

923
01:49:17,676 --> 01:49:19,011
What's wrong?

924
01:49:19,845 --> 01:49:22,514
- Is something wrong with Mama?
- No, don't worry.

925
01:49:22,723 --> 01:49:24,475
Everything's fine.

926
01:49:26,060 --> 01:49:27,644
I need your help.

927
01:49:29,897 --> 01:49:31,690
I want to return to Germany.

928
01:49:33,150 --> 01:49:35,819
I know. You want to, and Mama doesn't.

929
01:49:37,780 --> 01:49:40,324
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

930
01:49:40,532 --> 01:49:42,493
I want to and I have to return.

931
01:49:42,785 --> 01:49:45,204
Please, don't make it so difficult for me.

932
01:49:48,082 --> 01:49:50,626
I could never forgive myself
for making you unhappy.

933
01:49:51,627 --> 01:49:53,670
Why do we have to go back to Germany?

934
01:49:53,879 --> 01:49:55,798
The others don't have to.

935
01:49:56,006 --> 01:49:59,384
Inge said her father's becoming
an Englishman. You can, too.

936
01:49:59,593 --> 01:50:01,512
You're in the army, and he isn't.

937
01:50:03,764 --> 01:50:07,643
Perhaps lnge's father
will get an English passport.

938
01:50:07,851 --> 01:50:10,479
But that doesn't mean
he'll ever be an Englishman.

939
01:50:10,687 --> 01:50:14,775
Do you really think an English family
would ever invite him over?

940
01:50:14,983 --> 01:50:16,819
For example, your headmaster Brinkley.

941
01:50:17,027 --> 01:50:19,321
- He never would.
- Or anyone else.

942
01:50:20,197 --> 01:50:22,199
An English passport isn't enough for me.

943
01:50:22,407 --> 01:50:25,661
I don't want to be a man
with a name that isn't mine.

944
01:50:25,869 --> 01:50:29,915
I would always be an outsider in Kenya.
Do you know what that means to me?

945
01:50:30,290 --> 01:50:31,583
Yes, I do.

946
01:50:34,378 --> 01:50:35,879
My brave angel.

947
01:50:38,298 --> 01:50:41,426
Promise you won't be sad
when we go back home.

948
01:50:42,469 --> 01:50:44,596
Promise you'll trust me.

949
01:50:50,853 --> 01:50:52,688
If we have to return to Germany...

950
01:50:56,859 --> 01:50:58,610
can Owuor go with us?

951
01:51:03,991 --> 01:51:05,325
Not this time.

952
01:51:36,023 --> 01:51:37,816
Hello, my friend.

953
01:51:43,280 --> 01:51:45,908
Very nice. Where is the memsaab?

954
01:51:46,116 --> 01:51:48,702
She's out on the field.
With Bwana SUsskind.

955
01:51:50,787 --> 01:51:52,998
Was Bwana Siisskind often here?

956
01:52:22,527 --> 01:52:25,822
Then a corncob fell out of his left pant leg.

957
01:52:27,199 --> 01:52:31,161
The maize is really tall this year.
The rain came at the right time.

958
01:52:31,620 --> 01:52:33,830
- Gibson can be--
- This isn't our farm!

959
01:52:34,039 --> 01:52:36,041
And I don't care about the maize!

960
01:52:52,266 --> 01:52:54,601
I applied for repatriation.

961
01:52:55,394 --> 01:52:56,603
For what?

962
01:53:04,278 --> 01:53:07,114
The army is required to send
its soldiers back home.

963
01:53:10,909 --> 01:53:13,161
In our case that means Germany.

964
01:53:14,121 --> 01:53:15,914
They pay for the ship.

965
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,335
And you decided that all by yourself?

966
01:53:20,544 --> 01:53:23,380
But there are three of us.
Maybe Regina and I don't want to.

967
01:53:23,588 --> 01:53:25,299
I've already talked to her.

968
01:53:30,137 --> 01:53:32,014
Why are you doing this?

969
01:53:32,639 --> 01:53:35,100
Why don't you talk to me about it?

970
01:53:43,775 --> 01:53:46,862
I don't understand you!
How can you even consider returning?

971
01:53:47,070 --> 01:53:48,530
Stay out of this!

972
01:53:48,739 --> 01:53:51,325
You're not going to destroy my family!

973
01:53:52,868 --> 01:53:56,288
Know what your problem is?
You don't know who you are!

974
01:53:57,789 --> 01:54:01,460
We're Jews, Walter,
even if it doesn't mean much to you.

975
01:54:22,814 --> 01:54:24,733
I'll only say this once.

976
01:54:26,109 --> 01:54:28,487
If you like, you can stay with me.

977
01:54:30,697 --> 01:54:32,783
It would make me very happy.

978
01:54:51,843 --> 01:54:54,679
These will be
the best Konigsberger meatballs...

979
01:54:54,888 --> 01:54:57,099
that memsaab has ever eaten.

980
01:54:57,724 --> 01:54:59,309
But you don't have any capers.

981
01:54:59,726 --> 01:55:02,104
And you don't even know what capers are!

982
01:55:02,312 --> 01:55:04,439
I don't know what capers are...

983
01:55:04,773 --> 01:55:07,234
but I know that capers aren't necessary!

984
01:55:15,033 --> 01:55:17,494
Happy New Year, Rummler!

985
01:55:32,968 --> 01:55:35,512
Maybe it's because she has a girlfriend.

986
01:55:35,720 --> 01:55:40,600
Those were the best meatballs I've ever had.

987
01:55:40,809 --> 01:55:41,810
Thank you.

988
01:55:45,772 --> 01:55:48,775
I believe she prefers your ugali.

989
01:55:52,320 --> 01:55:55,866
When she was four in Leobschijtz
she loved Konigsberger meatballs.

990
01:55:58,994 --> 01:56:00,537
Happy New Year, Jettel.

991
01:56:05,792 --> 01:56:10,380
We need more guards for the fields.
A lot of corn is being stolen at night.

992
01:56:12,716 --> 01:56:15,093
Perhaps you could talk to the men.

993
01:56:18,638 --> 01:56:22,893
Jettel, they're waiting
for my decision in Frankfurt.

994
01:56:26,396 --> 01:56:28,356
I'm not going back to Germany.

995
01:56:29,107 --> 01:56:31,568
What about us?
Are you really ready to give us up?

996
01:56:31,776 --> 01:56:34,154
How can you still believe in that country?

997
01:56:39,367 --> 01:56:42,370
I'm a lawyer, and I love my job.
Perhaps you'll laugh at me...

998
01:56:42,579 --> 01:56:45,624
but I feel I could be useful
in a new Germany.

999
01:56:46,374 --> 01:56:50,670
You're such a damn idealist! Do you
think the Nazis suddenly disappeared?

1000
01:56:50,879 --> 01:56:53,089
We'd have to deal
with our parents' murderers.

1001
01:56:53,298 --> 01:56:57,552
I'm proud to be an idealist, because
it shows that I believe in mankind!

1002
01:56:57,761 --> 01:56:59,304
That may seem naive...

1003
01:56:59,513 --> 01:57:02,307
but every other belief
will lead to destruction!

1004
01:57:08,855 --> 01:57:12,192
This country saved our lives,
but it isn't our country!

1005
01:57:39,094 --> 01:57:42,013
- Can't you sleep?
- No.

1006
01:57:48,853 --> 01:57:52,232
In Germany there's lots of snow
in the winter, you see?

1007
01:57:52,440 --> 01:57:55,026
Isn't all that snow very cold?

1008
01:57:56,319 --> 01:57:57,320
Yes.

1009
01:58:01,950 --> 01:58:03,326
I hate snow.

1010
01:58:16,214 --> 01:58:19,050
Hey, busy beaver,
you're doing Owuor's work.

1011
01:58:19,801 --> 01:58:21,886
Mama needs your help.

1012
01:58:22,429 --> 01:58:23,972
It's harvest time.

1013
01:58:25,390 --> 01:58:28,435
She's managed quite well without me
the past few years.

1014
01:58:29,519 --> 01:58:31,605
I'd rather be at school than here.

1015
01:58:36,234 --> 01:58:37,861
Why is that, Papa?

1016
01:58:45,118 --> 01:58:46,536
I don't know.

1017
02:00:36,020 --> 02:00:37,313
Locusts!

1018
02:01:02,881 --> 02:01:04,424
The locusts are coming!

1019
02:01:04,632 --> 02:01:06,760
Many of them! Many of them!

1020
02:01:12,807 --> 02:01:16,311
When the locusts land on the field,
they'll eat everything!

1021
02:03:23,062 --> 02:03:25,732
They're leaving, Mama! They're leaving!

1022
02:04:17,450 --> 02:04:19,827
Like some? It's good for your voice.

1023
02:04:20,036 --> 02:04:21,287
Thank you.

1024
02:04:31,881 --> 02:04:33,758
Thanks for coming back.

1025
02:06:11,731 --> 02:06:13,816
- You have to be careful.
- Why?

1026
02:06:14,025 --> 02:06:15,693
Because I'm pregnant.

1027
02:06:17,570 --> 02:06:20,615
- From me?
- You bet!

1028
02:06:24,243 --> 02:06:26,579
Jettel, I don't want to lose you.

1029
02:06:55,483 --> 02:06:57,819
Can't we sit like this all night?

1030
02:07:58,671 --> 02:08:01,174
The men and the women in the village
never kiss.

1031
02:08:01,382 --> 02:08:03,593
They don't even know what kissing is.

1032
02:08:03,801 --> 02:08:04,760
Really?

1033
02:08:05,511 --> 02:08:06,929
What a shame.

1034
02:08:15,521 --> 02:08:18,608
Everything I love is lying on this bed.

1035
02:08:36,167 --> 02:08:39,545
<i>The song of the Pokot women
inspired me more than usual.</i>

1036
02:08:40,630 --> 02:08:43,549
<i>That morning,
Papa told me Mama was pregnant.</i>

1037
02:08:45,509 --> 02:08:47,511
<i>I sensed Owuor close by and knew...</i>

1038
02:08:47,720 --> 02:08:50,932
<i>he understood that this good news
was also sad news.</i>

1039
02:09:12,662 --> 02:09:15,790
The letter, I'll tear it up.

1040
02:09:16,290 --> 02:09:19,377
- What letter?
- From the Justice Dept. in Wiesbaden.

1041
02:09:19,585 --> 02:09:21,504
I can't leave without you.

1042
02:09:30,429 --> 02:09:33,557
My parents went to Frankfurt
on their honeymoon.

1043
02:09:34,475 --> 02:09:38,062
The first night my father
got terribly drunk on apple wine.

1044
02:09:39,355 --> 02:09:41,357
And Mama was very disappointed.

1045
02:09:45,653 --> 02:09:48,572
I'm so afraid of the people there.
Aren't you?

1046
02:09:49,782 --> 02:09:51,075
Yes, I am.

1047
02:09:55,997 --> 02:09:57,456
Do you love me?

1048
02:09:59,625 --> 02:10:01,085
If you let me.

1049
02:10:10,761 --> 02:10:12,596
Then you decide for us.

1050
02:12:11,590 --> 02:12:13,551
What are you doing here?

1051
02:12:14,009 --> 02:12:16,387
- I'm waiting for the sun.
- And why?

1052
02:12:16,887 --> 02:12:19,598
Are you going to sell the dog at the market?

1053
02:12:20,599 --> 02:12:22,726
I didn't want you to see me.

1054
02:12:22,935 --> 02:12:25,563
Rummler and I are going on a long safari.

1055
02:12:25,980 --> 02:12:28,566
The first to go on safari has dry eyes.

1056
02:12:34,613 --> 02:12:37,783
A man must go on safari
when his time has come.

1057
02:12:50,129 --> 02:12:52,214
Tell little memsaab goodbye.

1058
02:12:52,715 --> 02:12:56,010
Should I tell my daughter, "We left
and didn't want to see you again"?

1059
02:12:56,218 --> 02:12:58,345
Should I tell her,
"Rummler is gone forever"?

1060
02:12:58,554 --> 02:13:00,931
The dog is a part of my child.

1061
02:13:01,348 --> 02:13:04,602
You were there
when Rummler and Regina became friends.

1062
02:13:05,853 --> 02:13:10,483
The little memsaab will understand.
She always understands everything.

1063
02:13:11,025 --> 02:13:12,902
She has eyes and a heart like us.

1064
02:13:13,110 --> 02:13:16,030
Please, Owuor. Tell her goodbye.

1065
02:13:16,864 --> 02:13:21,285
Papa, Owuor has to go,
or do you want his heart to dry up?

1066
02:13:21,619 --> 02:13:25,831
- He doesn't want to die.
- What nonsense! Parting won't kill you!

1067
02:13:26,040 --> 02:13:28,209
Otherwise I'd already be dead.

1068
02:13:33,964 --> 02:13:36,842
Here is my black robe. You've forgotten it.

1069
02:13:37,593 --> 02:13:40,721
I haven't forgotten anything.
The robe doesn't belong to me.

1070
02:13:40,930 --> 02:13:43,974
But I gave it to you when you saved my life!

1071
02:13:44,850 --> 02:13:48,103
At that time you told me,
"I don't need the robe anymore.

1072
02:13:48,312 --> 02:13:50,731
"It is from a life which I have lost."

1073
02:13:50,940 --> 02:13:53,275
Now you've found that life again...

1074
02:13:53,484 --> 02:13:55,319
the life with the robe.

1075
02:13:57,613 --> 02:14:01,200
Please, Owuor, take it!
Without the robe you'll forget me.

1076
02:14:02,868 --> 02:14:04,578
My head won't forget you, bwana.

1077
02:14:04,787 --> 02:14:07,331
I have learned so many words from you.

1078
02:14:11,418 --> 02:14:15,631
No, Owuor. Pick me up again
like my first day in Rongai!

1079
02:14:20,928 --> 02:14:23,931
Don't leave. You don't want to go on safari.

1080
02:14:24,139 --> 02:14:26,767
Take care of bwana. He is still like a child!

1081
02:14:26,976 --> 02:14:29,979
You are wise. You must show him the way!

1082
02:15:10,936 --> 02:15:12,354
All the best.

1083
02:15:13,105 --> 02:15:15,524
Same to you. Thank you.

1084
02:15:29,663 --> 02:15:31,540
I hope you'll find happiness.

1085
02:15:34,960 --> 02:15:36,837
Take care of yourself.

1086
02:16:46,865 --> 02:16:48,617
I can't buy anything.

1087
02:16:48,909 --> 02:16:50,953
I'm as poor as a monkey.

1088
02:16:51,787 --> 02:16:54,081
- For the monkey.
- Thank you.

1089
02:17:21,650 --> 02:17:24,945
<i>My brother was born on 6 June 1947.</i>

1090
02:17:25,404 --> 02:17:29,700
<i>Thanks to the almighty god Ngai,
there were no complications.</i>

1091
02:17:30,075 --> 02:17:33,120
<i>He was big and strong,
and my parents named him Max...</i>

1092
02:17:33,328 --> 02:17:35,038
<i>after my grandfather.</i>
