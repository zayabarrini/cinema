1
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:10,074
What happens to this city?
Either there is ash or smoke.

2
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,979
Why doesn't anyone say anything?

3
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:16,211
Why do they tolerate
this smoke quietly?

4
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:18,848
It's the limit to tolerance.

5
00:00:19,285 --> 00:00:22,550
Let's douse cigarettes and cigars.

6
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:25,317
There is a ban on smoking
in public places.

7
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:27,759
You've to pay a ﬁne.

8
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:31,157
Don't smoke, don't let others smoke.

9
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:34,231
You've to pay dearly for smoking.

10
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:41,105
Everyone desires happiness.

11
00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:46,075
But at what cost?

12
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:50,017
Smoking costs dearly.

13
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:55,321
"Smoking is injurious
to your health"

14
00:00:57,791 --> 00:01:00,055
"to your loves ones too."

15
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,526
You've to pay dearly for smoking.

One moment

20
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:22,180
I've brought you a gift.

21
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,016
Thank you.

22
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:03,486
Are you okay?

23
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:08,230
Feels a bit weird, doesn't it?

24
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:00,375
Open the door!

25
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,621
What ﬁlth are you up to?

26
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:10,156
My clothes?

27
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:11,821
Open the dour!!!

00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:13,490
WOW!

29
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:16,898
Turned this into a bazaar, eh?

30
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,598
Well done!

31
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:22,832
Move it!

32
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,605
Get his name.

33
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:28,671
- Your name!
- Piyush Agarwal.

34
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:30,843
- What do you do?
- Sir, I am a student

35
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:31,849
I am a student, sir!

36
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,010
- Where are you from?
- Allahabad.

37
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,951
<i>Allahabad.</i>

<i>Is this what they leach you?</i>

39
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:38,984
Can't we agree on a settlement?

40
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:41,152
Show him a good "settlement"!

41
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,524
<i>I will 'settle' things
with madam till then.</i>

42
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,262
Your name?

43
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:48,357
Name?!

44
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:52,329
- Say it!
- Devi.

45
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:55,073
Devi, you're life is now ruined.

46

- Piyush!
- Catch him!

47
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,204
Drag him out!

48
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:04,145
Let's work out that "settlement"
you asked for.

49
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,376
No, sir!

50
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:09,587
I'm a college student, Sir.
It's my ﬁrst time here.

51
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:12,016
<i>Come out, you brat!</i>

52
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:17,521
<i>Open up!</i>

53
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,028
Get me his wallet.

54
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:27,768
<i>Open the door!</i>

00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:31,402

out in a minute!

59
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:50,260
Come out now kiddo,
or your dad gets the call.

60
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:52,127
Sir... I just want to use the toilet.

61
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:55,361
You can shit in prison.
Your dad's phone is busy.

62
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:58,168
Please don't call my dad!
I beg you!

63
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:00,069
<i>We will call him again, shortly.</i>

64
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,635
<i>Please let us go.</i>

65
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:08,606
Where are you from?
The local brothel?

66
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:10,238
Face the camera.

67
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,676
No - From Nepal?

68
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,650
You've got it wrong.

69
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,788
Really? We've got it wrong?

70
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:19,921
What are you waiting for?

71
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:23,018
Break open the damn door!

72
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:25,094
Come out now!

73
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:27,265
Are you at a confessional?

74
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,526
Knock it down!

75
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:35,838
- Sir!
- Yes?

76
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:38,134
Sir, look what he's done!

77
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:40,037
What now?

78
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:45,811
Hey Pandey! Call the ambulance.

79
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,276
<i>Hurry UP.</i>

80
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:53,150
Careful!

81
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,442
Get her dressed and
take her to the station.

82
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:03,126
Home already, son?

83
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,456
Let me get you some water.

84
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:07,029
It's okay, I'll get it myself

85
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:08,528
I'll get it.

86
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:19,808
Mother, it's time to prepare the stove.

87
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:23,638
Son, get holy ﬁre to ﬁre up the stove.

88
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:29,211
Wake Sikandar <i>up</i> too,
his shift starts soon.

89
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:31,155
Brother!

90
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,158
Brother...

91
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:35,554
Sikandar...

92
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,321
Brother...

93
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:39,530
Mother sent me to wake you up.

94
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:41,731
Wake up!

95
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:55,845
Ram, the name of God,
is eternal truth!

96
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:13,328
Dad, I'll light the stove
and be back.

97
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:15,833
- And Sikandar?
- He's up... on his way here.

98
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:29,744
<i>Mr. Motilal...</i>

99
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:31,210
Come, have some sweets.

100
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:32,883
<i>I can't leave my shop unattended.</i>

101
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:35,044
Come on! Nobody's going
to steal anything.

102
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:38,715
They've got sweets.
They're from the university, right?

103
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:41,657
We're doing an anthropology project.

104
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:45,826
They want to know about our ghats,
enlighten them.

105
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:48,467
You're our ghat scholar!

106
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:51,003
And you, our scholar on shady alleys!

107
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,595
The sleazy ones at night!

108
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,671
You're recording this?

109
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:58,309
Yes sir, one tends to miss
details while writing.

110
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,545
History... Huh?

111
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:07,946
Earlier, the banks of Mother
Ganges were a vast forest.

112
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:11,279
Cremation rituals began
in the Holy River.

113
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:15,290
So, various kings set up ghats.

114
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:19,027
Priests from all over
started settling here.

115
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:20,865
Ghats were assigned...

116
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:24,493
according to state, caste...
and priests.

117
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:26,195
Did you understand?

118
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:28,667
The ghat we're sitting on right now...

119
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,207
is under dispute.

120
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,971
Like Kashmir - Yes, like Kashmir.

121
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,443
The Maharasthrians claim
it to be theirs...

122
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:38,506
as so do the Gujratis.

123
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,347
What do we do with this brat?

124
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:45,287
Meet Jhonta. Ghat hero,
running for president...

125
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:49,089
but ask him to get me customers
and he runs like an athlete!

126
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:50,720
- What happened?
- I was about to...

127
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:53,331
Bring me my phone!
Hurry up! Now!

128
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:57,297
The Scindia ghat, the one
right next to ours...

129
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,498
I'll look for customers, master!

130
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:04,603
Kids these days are so restless,
always on the run.

131
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:08,675
And so is this wretched phone.

132
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,112
Misery of modern times!

133
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:13,617
Hello?

134
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:16,448
Yes, speaking.

135
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:20,523
Look at the ingenuity of
these kids.

136
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,659
She changed into a
saree, all spruced up.

137
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:25,654
<i>They barely knew each other...</i>

138
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,461
<i>and just look ham!</i>

139
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:29,191
What for?

140
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:34,470
What did you tell us a while back?

141
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:36,300
Say it out loud.

142
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:37,871
Enlighten your father.

143
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,739
<i>What was that phrase?</i>

144
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:41,074
<i>"Curbing curiosity!"</i>

145
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:45,046
If l tip off a journalist...

146
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:49,045
it would make the front page.

147
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:50,945
What is this?

148
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,488
A ﬁle of another department
on my desk?

149
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:55,751
What shit!!

150
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:59,024
Make the corrections and
get out of my face!

151
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,493
What is your name again?

152
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:05,536
Pathak.

153
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:10,507
Vidhyadhar Pathak

154
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:16,005
I offer ritual services
at Nandeshwar ghat

155
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:21,478
I used to be a Sanskrit
professor at the university.

156
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:25,449
- Now I translate.
- We'll call you in 3 days.

157
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:30,362
Pay the bail here, and take
your daughter for now.

158
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:35,360
Mr. Mishra,
what do you mean "for now"?

159
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:40,671
If anything happens to the boy...

160
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,468
it'll be a case of
abetment of suicide.

161
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:48,673
Court, media, journalists,
the whole shebang!

162
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,543
No pleading!
Go pay the bail over there.

163
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:54,813
We're from the same community.

164
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:56,355
Go pay the bail and get out!

165
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:09,684
Centrifugal force turned into centripetal
and people hit a deadlock there...

166
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:12,018
so they started moving upwards.

167
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:15,924
And this led to the birth of
Civil Engineering.

168
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:17,086
Any question?

169
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:18,630
No, sir!

170
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:24,466
- You can do this alone.
- Come on, I need the support.

171
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:32,109
Add some flavored corn in it.

172
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:33,508
Some green chilies on the side.

173
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:34,636
Roast it properly!

174
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,142
Like always.

175
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:38,046
Of course, madam!
Exactly the way you want it.

176
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,140
Pooja!

177
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:40,942
Pooja!

178
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:42,612
Happy Birthday to you!

179
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:49,489
Please?

180
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:50,687
Thank you.

181
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:51,963
Did you like it?

182
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:54,130
So when is the birthday treat?

183
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,000
How will she explain
this to her folks?

184
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:58,130
As in?

185
00:18:58,203 --> 00:19:01,400
How will she explain who
gave this huge gift?

186
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,506
I'm cool with any excuse.

187
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:05,634
Oh really? Give this to me.

188
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:06,968
Here, take this back.

189
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:08,774
No, I got this as a gift.

190
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:11,816
Gifts are not supposed to be
returned. Come on now!

191
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:13,407
But what will she tell her folks?

192
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,214
Add more of these peanuts.

193
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:17,688
- Say something.
- She can say you've gifted it to her.

194
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:20,282
Like her folks are going
to believe that!

195
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:24,588
Enough, don't roast it more!
A dash of green sauce too.

196
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,222
More of these chilli ﬂakes as well.

197
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,899
Last time you put very
little garlic in it.

198
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:31,425
- Be generous this time.
- Yes, madam.

199
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:35,171
Have you ever heard of a girl gifting a
teddy bear to another girl?

200
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:36,703
Don't they?

201
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:41,407
Nor have I ever seen a girl
fuss over a 5 rupee snack!

202
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:44,946
<i>We need to go.</i>

203
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:46,814
Take this teddy with you.

204
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,978
No, thanks, we're in a hurry!
Let's go.

205
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:54,555
Good morning, master!

206
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:56,487
I had an early bath today!

207
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:06,299
You haven't shown up for 3 days.

208
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:09,963
<i>Mind your own business.</i>

209
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:31,690
Is your father home?

210
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:34,094
He's gone to the ghat.

211
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:36,091
Call him.

212
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,074
The boy is dead.

213
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:38,393
Did you offer some tea?

214
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:41,493
Have a seat.

215
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:43,498
Sorry, I'm late.

216
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,669
Well, the boy didn't survive.

217
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:55,474
They're doing an autopsy and
we'll have the report soon.

218
00:21:57,115 --> 00:21:58,742
Here are the court papers.

219
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:00,985
Please ﬁll them up.

220
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:02,248
Wait...

221
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:06,990
what do we have to do
with the court?

222
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:09,187
It's a case of abetment of suicide.

223
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:16,367
But the boy...

224
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,965
killed himself on your watch

225
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:22,504
I mean... because of
police intimidation.

226
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:30,311
So now you are acting the Professor?

227
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,708
Here's the thing...

228
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:37,683
you can save your lecture to jerk off
your ghat customers.

229
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:39,818
Okay?

230
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,152
You must have seen it on TV?

231
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:45,856
The R.K Puram sex scandal,
Jammu and Kashmir sex scandal.

232
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:49,295
<i>Your</i> daughter <i>is</i> now part of
a big sex scandal!

233
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:53,968
Sir, please suggest a way out.

234
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,305
How much do you earn?

235
00:23:07,352 --> 00:23:09,821
Around 8 to 10 thousand rupees.

236
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:12,483
She earns as well, right?

237
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:16,183
Yes... at a computer
coaching institute

238
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:19,791
I won't beat around the bush.

239
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:24,030
Abetment...

240
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:28,507
media, court...
I can handle all of that.

241
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,638
But you'll have to
make arrangements

242
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:34,009
3 lakh rupees.
I'm giving you 3 months.

243
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:37,875
Sir, you've got us wrong.

244
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,709
We're principled people.

245
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:45,020
We can hardly manage 50,000 rupees!

246
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,990
From now on...

247
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:48,451
never ever...

248
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:51,190
ever... negotiate with me.

249
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:54,598
Am I selling you a bloody soap?!

250
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:01,898
I'm hereto save your honour

251
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:09,804
I have your daughter's sex
scandal video on my phone.

252
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:16,278
One upload and the whole city
will get off on your daughter!

253
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,259
Arrange 1 lakh Rupees in two days.

254
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,622
Don't just nod like a horse!

255
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:26,722
What will you do?

256
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:30,925
Arrange 1 lakh Rupees
in two days.

257
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:33,167
And, after 2 months?

258
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:36,663
2 lakh Rupees.

259
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:38,942
Is the math really that hard?

260
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:00,893
Where to Madam?

261
00:25:02,934 --> 00:25:05,335
- To the cremation ghat.
- It's forbidden for women.

262
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:10,633
Hit the skull hard, 5 times.

263
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:26,018
Deepak, give him a hand.

264
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:29,926
Piyush! My son!

265
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:34,694
Harder! Smash the skull
to release the soul!

266
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:48,035
How many more days
left in college?

267
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,213
Two more months, Dad.

268
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:54,074
Then exams and placements!

269
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:56,755
- What?
- I mean job placements.

270
00:25:57,155 --> 00:25:59,590
Don't you need to
pay something to get a job?

271
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:01,425
Not anymore, Mother.

272
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:03,885
The Railway and Electric companies...

273
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:05,259
hire on merit.

274
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:19,767
Instead of supervising the ash cleaning,
you're feasting here?

275
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:22,170
What if the boys steal the
silver?

276
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,641
Uncle Shambhu is supervising it.

277
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,405
Shambu is a pothead!

278
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:27,315
So? Am I not even
supposed to eat?

279
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:39,490
How much will the job pay?

280
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,790
They will let me know
after the interview.

281
00:26:43,468 --> 00:26:44,958
Great! Get out of this place.

282
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:49,807
The sooner, the better.

283
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:54,371
Otherwise, even your life will
end up torching bodies.

284
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:01,244
Bread!

285
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,922
Look what I found,
I think it's silver!

286
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:12,896
Show me!

287
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:15,763
<i>Throw it you fool. It's aluminium.</i>

288
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,070
Will you ever explain yourself?

289
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:59,010
I met him at the coaching center

290
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:02,671
I used to type out his thesis...

291
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:05,807
and we became friends.

292
00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:12,248
That's all?

293
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:18,087
Yes, I felt nice talking to him.

294
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:24,436
Did you even think twice
before doing it?

295
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:27,895
Even once?

296
00:28:28,606 --> 00:28:29,698
Did you?

297
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:31,174
Answer me!

298
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:37,939
What?

299
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:46,521
- Cat got your tongue?
- I don't know.

300
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:53,019
A boy just killed himself.

301
00:28:54,265 --> 00:28:56,256
A ransom of 3 lakhs on our heads

302
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:58,929
l just broke my 1 lakh Rupees
ﬁxed deposit.

303
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:01,238
You're one step away from jail...

304
00:29:02,006 --> 00:29:03,906
and you say "l don't know"

305
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:17,748
I ﬁshed out 26 Rupees.

306
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:21,687
Please, let me be part
of the competition.

307
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:25,889
Are you actually asking me
to let you gamble?

308
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:26,897
It's not gambling!

309
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:29,297
It's sport and
I have become a pro at it.

310
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:31,768
Why are you acting so smart?

311
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:34,302
Today I will play, no matter what.

312
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:37,908
Why don't you shut up
and do some work!

313
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:40,035
Got screwed over by a bull or what?

314
00:29:43,014 --> 00:29:45,108
Pooja looks so pretty with the teddy.

315
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,840
Cute, isn't she?

316
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:49,821
Can you ask
for her friend's name?

317
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:52,117
How would I ask?

318
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:56,957
"My friend has a crush
on your poetry-reading friend...

319
00:29:57,028 --> 00:30:00,726
give me her name
so he can ask her out?"

320
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,933
OK, how about we send
her a written request?

321
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:04,799
Deepak is getting
emotional about her.

322
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,665
Like they say...

323
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:08,206
"Shake the mango all night,

324
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:10,673
it'll only fall off the tree
when it's time is ripe".

325
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:12,141
What is that noise there?

326
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:15,804
Okay, listen...

327
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:17,344
do you remember what
she looks like?

328
00:30:20,084 --> 00:30:21,483
- Sure?
- Yes.

329
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:24,879
Okay.

330
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:27,522
This is her college group page.
She's got to be here.

331
00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:31,226
Won't you ﬁnd her
in Pooja's album?

332
00:30:31,696 --> 00:30:34,290
Of course! She'll be in
Pooja's friend list.

333
00:30:35,466 --> 00:30:36,524
Is that her?

334
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:38,167
No.

335
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:40,295
There... there... That's her!

336
00:30:42,373 --> 00:30:43,704
Shaalu Gupta.

337
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:45,534
Gupta family, eh?

338
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:46,977
Awesome, dude!

339
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:51,107
Now create your Facebook account
and let the ﬁreworks begin!

340
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:55,050
I mean send her a friend request.

341
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:56,748
Should we?

342
00:30:58,189 --> 00:30:59,122
Yeah.

343
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:04,860
Come one, come all, make big money!
Here's the super competition!

344
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:09,924
In half an hour, increase your gain!
10 rupees turns to 50! 50 turns to 200!

345
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:11,935
Now listen to the rules.

346
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:16,167
These kids will dive in
and bring out coins!

347
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:19,537
Bet on the boy you think
will get the most coins.

348
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:22,306
Great! We have your 20 Rupees on Lokua.

349
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,576
Don't think twice!
Just place your bets!

350
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:27,375
20 Rupees on Netwa.

351
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:30,280
The competition is about to begin!

352
00:31:31,489 --> 00:31:34,049
1... 2...

353
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:44,660
Now let's see who
gets the most coins!

354
00:31:45,103 --> 00:31:48,368
<i>Lokua has 3 coins!</i>

355
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:51,966
- Netwa, hurry! Faster!
- Babua's got only one coin this time.

356
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:56,378
Let's see who's winning...
Munna has 6 coins in one dive.

357
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:57,710
Hold your breath folks.

358
00:31:57,782 --> 00:32:01,116
- Please let me join in!
- No, just watch.

359
00:32:03,521 --> 00:32:09,483
Those who've bet on Netwa,
will get three times their money!

360
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:01,806
Hello?

361
00:33:01,913 --> 00:33:02,846
<i>Hello Devi?</i>

362
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:04,479
Yes?

363
00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:07,675
Where were you hiding
your phone all this while?

364
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:09,678
<i>You think l am an idiot?</i>

365
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,117
<i>I</i> know what dirty
business you've been upto.

366
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:15,020
<i>Bloody witch...</i>

367
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:49,319
Move!

368
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:15,842
Hey!

369
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:17,451
What are you doing here?!

370
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:18,683
Who let you in?

371
00:34:19,257 --> 00:34:20,850
I came hereto collect my stuff...

372
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:24,060
and if you make those ﬁlthy calls again,
I'll thrash the hell out of you!

373
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:25,652
He was our top student!

374
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,822
Weren't you ashamed to do it?

375
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:28,865
Whatever it was, we both
were equally involved.

376
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:30,957
But he was the only one to die.

377
00:34:36,707 --> 00:34:38,368
Sikandar!

378
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:41,440
Thrust the leg into the
pyre, you idiot!

379
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:46,211
Sikandar!

380
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:48,046
Looks like the old man is drunk.

381
00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:51,855
Pour me another drink
'King of the Doms'!

382
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:53,717
One more for your health!

383
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,429
Do I look like a king to you?

384
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:04,167
Come on! There are only
two kings in Banaras!

385
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:07,794
One is Kashi Naresh and
the other is the Dom king.

386
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:09,900
One on that side...

387
00:35:09,974 --> 00:35:11,237
and one on this side.

388
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:13,671
Look at that miserable Shambu.

389
00:35:15,913 --> 00:35:18,245
How many 'bonus days' in a year?

390
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:21,285
Hey! Shambu!

391
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:22,953
Yes, sir!

392
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:25,717
Once every 10 years.

393
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:29,116
Shambhu gets a 'bonus day'
every 10 years!

394
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:31,557
Meaning?

395
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,196
That day...

396
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:38,966
he gets all the money
from every cremation here.

397
00:35:41,372 --> 00:35:42,669
Shambu's father...

398
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:47,375
got his 'bonus day' once in a year.

399
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:50,810
Overjoyed by that,
he had ten children.

400
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:52,746
The 'bonus day' got split.

401
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:58,585
Since the father
had one day in a year...

402
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:02,458
Shambhu inherited
a tenth of the 'bonus day'

403
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:07,262
Now he has one every 10 years.

404
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,967
When is your next 'bonus day', Shambu?

405
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:14,332
Never again

406
00:36:14,705 --> 00:36:17,766
I sold my rights to Lala.

407
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:21,172
<i>He gave me 1 lakh Rupees for it.</i>

408
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:24,240
<i>I'll live the rest of my life off alms.</i>

409
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:26,340
If l sell my 'bonus day'...

410
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:28,680
I'll get over 10 lakh Rupees.
Right, lala?

411
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:30,944
As if you are ever going
to sell it to me.

412
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,315
Should we sell?

413
00:36:32,423 --> 00:36:34,357
<i>Asking your ignorant son?</i>

414
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:36,620
He has nothing to do with
our cremation ghat!

415
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:38,986
He's nothing but an educated fool!

416
00:36:39,063 --> 00:36:40,929
You're insulting my son?

417
00:36:40,998 --> 00:36:42,523
I'll never sell my 'bonus day' to you!

418
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:44,931
As if you'd ever think to do so!

419
00:36:47,004 --> 00:36:50,736
Father, I need some money.
For the Durga Puja Carnival.

420
00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:52,943
There, in my shirt.

421
00:36:53,444 --> 00:36:54,969
May I take 300 Rupees?

422
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:56,871
Take as much as you want.

423
00:36:57,448 --> 00:36:59,143
You're the only one!

424
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:11,092
Are you going to the Durga puja
carnival tonight?

425
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:46,859
20 rupees.

426
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,204
Put the watch in the hat.

427
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:00,505
Easy! Right inside.

428
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,238
Now it's inside.

429
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:04,577
Now blow into the hat.

430
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:07,378
The watch has...

431
00:38:08,085 --> 00:38:09,746
vanished!

432
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:13,657
The watch will re-appear...

433
00:38:13,758 --> 00:38:14,884
in someone's pocket.

434
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:17,291
He has it!

435
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:19,120
Man in the red shirt!

436
00:38:19,597 --> 00:38:20,996
Check your pockets.

437
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,290
He found the watch.

438
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:25,597
Come on stage, young man!

439
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,838
- Your name?
- Deepak

440
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:51,456
I'll never smoke again.
Yesterday, my friends forced me to

441
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:25,387
I deserve at least 12,000 a month
with my qualiﬁcations.

442
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:27,958
Don't negotiate.
He was my best student.

443
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:30,818
Professor taught us
till 10th grade.

444
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:34,659
It's thanks to him
that we are what we are.

445
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:36,490
Tea, please.

446
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:38,558
No thank you, I have to go...

447
00:40:38,669 --> 00:40:41,001
and ﬁnish the book translation.

448
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:43,768
Glass of water?
From the earthenware pot

449
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:47,767
I received your CV by e-mail.

450
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:49,605
Unfortunately...

451
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,212
we have no positions open
for instructors.

452
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:53,975
We need a receptionist.

453
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:57,516
Welcoming and counseling
new students.

454
00:40:57,721 --> 00:41:01,282
<i>Some database work, paid extra.</i>

455
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:03,486
Comes to 5.5K a month.

456
00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:05,689
Perfect!

457
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:06,991
She'll start tomorrow.

458
00:41:07,431 --> 00:41:09,525
- Thank you so much, Sanjay!
- Oh! Come on, Sir.

459
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:10,998
<i>It's the least l could do</i>

460
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:12,866
I must take this call.

461
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:16,031
Please, have some water.
The new Earthenware pot...

462
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,302
<i>makes the water taste very sweet!</i>

463
00:41:24,381 --> 00:41:25,746
He meant 5,500 rupees only.

464
00:41:27,184 --> 00:41:29,448
What he meant was a lot of
respect for your father.

465
00:41:34,058 --> 00:41:35,355
Thank you.

466
00:41:42,366 --> 00:41:44,835
So you're studying
at the Polytechnic Institute?

467
00:41:44,902 --> 00:41:48,566
Yes. Civil engineering, ﬁnal year.

468
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:53,867
We had a college strike
last year...

469
00:41:53,978 --> 00:41:56,538
otherwise, I would have a job by now.

470
00:41:58,415 --> 00:42:00,247
What are your hobbies?

471
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:01,981
Music.

472
00:42:02,052 --> 00:42:03,645
- Are you a singer?
- No

473
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:08,618
I listen to music,
on radio and on CDs too.

474
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:10,453
Just music?

475
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:12,355
I also like poetry a lot!

476
00:42:12,463 --> 00:42:13,953
- Poetry?
- Yes.

477
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:15,624
Bashir Badr...

478
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:17,027
Akbar Allahabadi...

479
00:42:17,134 --> 00:42:18,295
Mirza Ghalib...

480
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:21,333
You must have at least
heard of Ghalib's name?

481
00:42:22,172 --> 00:42:23,367
Yeah.

482
00:42:27,177 --> 00:42:28,667
Here, please have some.

483
00:42:30,314 --> 00:42:32,715
May I get some sauce?

484
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:34,147
Schezwan sauce?

485
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:36,186
May I get some please.

486
00:42:37,021 --> 00:42:38,648
Please start - No, after you.

487
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:40,156
No, you go ﬁrst.

488
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:46,094
So...

489
00:42:46,363 --> 00:42:48,525
now we're friends right?

490
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:00,305
By the way,"-

491
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:05,847
if you're ever in trouble,
let me know.

492
00:43:08,052 --> 00:43:09,520
What will you do?

493
00:43:10,821 --> 00:43:11,413
Ill...

494
00:43:11,488 --> 00:43:13,252
sort things out for you...

495
00:43:13,657 --> 00:43:15,421
if anyone bothers you...

496
00:43:15,492 --> 00:43:17,654
teases you or makes you cry.

497
00:43:18,028 --> 00:43:20,622
There are lots of nasty boys
around here.

498
00:43:20,698 --> 00:43:21,927
Okay.

499
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:25,429
What if...

500
00:43:27,972 --> 00:43:29,633
you make me cry?

501
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:32,068
Me? No... Why?

502
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:40,645
I'd sort that out for you too.

503
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:45,990
Write the student's name here,
in capital letters.

504
00:43:46,056 --> 00:43:49,856
This is our prospectus
with a complimentary CD.

505
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,450
All the information is in here.

506
00:43:51,528 --> 00:43:54,520
Come back tomorrow and it'll be done.

507
00:43:54,598 --> 00:43:56,191
Thank you - Thank you.

508
00:44:05,542 --> 00:44:07,271
You're quite a sweet talker!

509
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:10,511
Is this your ﬁrst job?

510
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:13,310
No.

511
00:44:15,352 --> 00:44:16,979
What happened to the previous job?

512
00:44:18,455 --> 00:44:19,854
I didn't like the job

513
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,923
I know exactly where
your previous job was.

514
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:33,696
Enter our "Match the Face" contest!

515
00:44:33,804 --> 00:44:37,138
Guess the actors
and send us the answers.

516
00:44:37,207 --> 00:44:41,144
If you get it right,
you could win a brand new car!

517
00:44:41,578 --> 00:44:43,307
Lines are open now...

518
00:45:55,719 --> 00:45:58,154
- Do you want to go in?
- Yes!

519
00:45:58,222 --> 00:46:00,247
- Please!
- How many coins did you ﬁnd today?

520
00:46:00,324 --> 00:46:03,453
More than their fathers ever will!
Please let me compete!

521
00:46:03,527 --> 00:46:04,824
OK, relax.

522
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:06,995
Let's go.

523
00:46:07,898 --> 00:46:08,694
Run along!

524
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:18,038
Ladies and gentlemen,
the competition has begun!

525
00:46:18,142 --> 00:46:20,611
Let's see who ﬁnds the most coins.

526
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,118
Put the coins here.

527
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:35,124
Dive over there!

528
00:46:41,431 --> 00:46:42,660
20 rupees on Jhonta?

529
00:46:42,733 --> 00:46:43,791
How much?

530
00:46:44,501 --> 00:46:46,196
Over here!

531
00:46:52,075 --> 00:46:53,474
Piyush Agarwal.

532
00:46:54,011 --> 00:46:55,672
HOMETOWN: Allahabad?

533
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:01,781
He passed away.

534
00:47:02,419 --> 00:47:04,251
Something tragic happened to him

535
00:47:05,522 --> 00:47:06,887
I read about it

536
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,229
I'm from his coaching center.

537
00:47:12,529 --> 00:47:14,497
We have some ﬁles
that belonged to him.

538
00:47:14,598 --> 00:47:17,090
And he owed us some money.

539
00:47:17,901 --> 00:47:20,302
He was to return some
books as well, so...

540
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:24,234
could I have his address please?

541
00:47:25,142 --> 00:47:27,110
Come out now! The game's over.

542
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:29,509
Who has the most coins?

543
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:31,509
Hey, Munna!

544
00:47:31,615 --> 00:47:33,413
Who is the winner?

545
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:35,015
Jhonta!

546
00:47:36,787 --> 00:47:38,414
I told you I would win.

547
00:47:38,488 --> 00:47:40,718
<i>Jhonta has won 980 Rupees.</i>

548
00:47:40,824 --> 00:47:42,519
You were great!

549
00:47:54,938 --> 00:47:56,133
<i>Hello?</i>

550
00:48:03,747 --> 00:48:09,686
<i>Hide these</i> stars <i>safely in my eyes,
the night</i> will <i>be</i> along <i>one.</i>

551
00:48:10,654 --> 00:48:18,152
Wanderers like us, will meet somewhere,
perhaps in the morning light.

552
00:48:20,297 --> 00:48:21,025
Then?

553
00:48:21,131 --> 00:48:22,155
"And then?"

554
00:48:22,532 --> 00:48:24,398
That was it.

555
00:48:24,468 --> 00:48:28,905
Sorry, I didn't get it. I mean
I got some of it... it was terriﬁc!

556
00:48:29,473 --> 00:48:31,134
You're such a dumbo!

557
00:48:33,777 --> 00:48:34,835
And very cute!

558
00:48:35,479 --> 00:48:36,537
What did you just say?

559
00:48:36,647 --> 00:48:37,910
I didn't say anything.

560
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:40,178
But I heard that!

561
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:43,251
If l recite Chakbast, you'll faint!

562
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:49,359
Your birthday's soon, right?
I saw on Facebook.

563
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:50,292
Really?

564
00:48:50,661 --> 00:48:52,686
Facebook didn't tell you everything.

565
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:54,128
What?

566
00:48:54,498 --> 00:48:55,693
A Picnic!

567
00:48:56,366 --> 00:48:57,197
<i>Shaalu?</i>

568
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:01,132
Mom's calling. We'll talk later.

569
00:49:01,238 --> 00:49:01,932
Hold on...

570
00:49:02,005 --> 00:49:03,598
What is it?

571
00:49:04,474 --> 00:49:07,876
Please call me by my name.

572
00:49:10,213 --> 00:49:12,580
Only if you memorize two poems...

573
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:15,214
then I'll decide.
I have to go now.

574
00:49:15,385 --> 00:49:15,977
Hello?

575
00:49:16,086 --> 00:49:17,383
Bye.

576
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,751
<i>A poem by Dushyant Kumar.</i>

577
00:49:26,263 --> 00:49:28,664
<i>You move like the misty morning train.</i>

578
00:49:28,765 --> 00:49:31,234
<i>I tremble like a bridge in the rain.</i>

579
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:33,694
<i>In the deep jungle of your gaze.</i>

580
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:36,500
<i>I lose my way, no trail to blaze.</i>

581
00:49:37,007 --> 00:49:38,600
<i>Who is it?</i>

582
00:49:39,443 --> 00:49:41,639
May I speak with Ramdhari Agarwal?

583
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:44,613
<i>Speaking. Who is this?</i>

584
00:49:45,716 --> 00:49:47,912
I... I...

585
00:49:49,453 --> 00:49:51,854
<i>What do you want? Hello?</i>

586
00:49:52,189 --> 00:49:54,817
I'm calling from Kashi
Co-operative bank.

587
00:49:54,925 --> 00:49:56,984
We have a new scheme

588
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:59,654
<i>l don't need anything, thank you!</i>

589
00:50:26,289 --> 00:50:28,451
I'll come straight to the point.

590
00:50:30,093 --> 00:50:31,492
Will you sleep with me?

591
00:50:31,962 --> 00:50:32,986
<i>Tell me</i>

592
00:50:34,164 --> 00:50:35,598
I won't tell anyone.

593
00:50:36,666 --> 00:50:38,361
You had sex with him too, right?

594
00:50:41,004 --> 00:50:43,564
Why are you worried about your wife?
This is good quality stuff.

595
00:50:43,673 --> 00:50:46,335
It's too expensive - It is not!

596
00:50:46,777 --> 00:50:49,508
Let me give you a discount.

597
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:54,583
Think it over
and come back later, okay?

598
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:01,248
I quit my job.

599
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:04,918
<i>Pathak...</i>

600
00:51:04,995 --> 00:51:07,123
<i>your daughter hasn't visited
for</i> ages.

601
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:08,364
Good morning.

602
00:51:12,669 --> 00:51:14,034
Get out of here.

603
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:16,831
What?

604
00:51:17,974 --> 00:51:19,738
Should I drown myself with shame?

605
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:21,836
Go away.

606
00:51:27,017 --> 00:51:28,746
Madam just quit her job!

607
00:51:29,553 --> 00:51:32,022
What were you thinking?

608
00:51:32,456 --> 00:51:33,287
Nothing.

609
00:51:33,356 --> 00:51:36,223
"Nothing", "l don't know",
that's all you know!

610
00:51:37,194 --> 00:51:38,855
Was I ever hard on you?

611
00:51:39,696 --> 00:51:42,722
I've always been liberal...
raised you like a boy.

612
00:51:43,166 --> 00:51:45,828
What did I do to deserve
such a scandal?

613
00:51:45,902 --> 00:51:47,301
I haven't created any scandal.

614
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:48,735
Then what is this?

615
00:51:50,307 --> 00:51:52,708
All this scampering for loose
change! What is this?

616
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:54,574
On the ghat, in the streets...

617
00:51:54,678 --> 00:51:58,740
I'm constantly afraid someone
will ask about you! What is this?

618
00:51:58,849 --> 00:52:00,112
That's your fear.

619
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:03,283
Hence, I've decided
not to live here anymore.

620
00:52:04,721 --> 00:52:06,951
The smaller the city, the
narrower the world-view.

621
00:52:07,023 --> 00:52:09,924
After all this, you're still living
in this house with dignity...

622
00:52:09,993 --> 00:52:10,983
- And my world-view is narrow?
- Wow!

623
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:12,790
How considerate of you, Father!

624
00:52:13,497 --> 00:52:15,295
Should I start paying rent as well?

625
00:52:17,934 --> 00:52:18,833
Look at me.

626
00:52:19,069 --> 00:52:20,366
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

627
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:21,960
Why are you taking revenge?

628
00:52:22,038 --> 00:52:23,802
Revenge for what?

629
00:52:23,874 --> 00:52:25,000
For Mother!

630
00:52:30,714 --> 00:52:33,274
You don't even remember
what she looked like.

631
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:34,681
You were just 6 years old.

632
00:52:35,185 --> 00:52:38,086
Are 6 year-olds blind?

633
00:52:38,722 --> 00:52:41,054
I took her to the hospital, didn't l?

634
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:45,595
For 2 days, she begged you
to take her, but you didn't.

635
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:47,288
Your students mattered more.

636
00:52:47,464 --> 00:52:48,727
<i>You did nothing!</i>

637
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:51,699
I thought it was just fever.
I messed up.

638
00:52:52,569 --> 00:52:54,298
But I never neglected you, did l?

639
00:52:54,371 --> 00:52:56,863
I left my job at the university,
for your sake!

640
00:52:56,973 --> 00:53:00,637
I ended up selling books
on the ghat, for your sake!

641
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:01,836
You think I killed your mother?

642
00:53:01,945 --> 00:53:04,505
So do you think I killed that boy?

643
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:08,143
Answer me?

644
00:53:09,419 --> 00:53:11,148
He killed himself!

645
00:53:15,325 --> 00:53:18,454
You're crazy.
You're getting confused

646
00:53:22,299 --> 00:53:23,824
I'm not getting confused

647
00:53:25,802 --> 00:53:27,861
I will defend my honor

648
00:53:29,472 --> 00:53:30,803
I won't go to prison.

649
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:33,203
You have decided
everything for yourself!

650
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:35,472
I'm the fool who arranges the money

651
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:37,810
I'll arrange the ransom too.

652
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:40,975
Next you'll say you don't even
need a father.

653
00:53:42,185 --> 00:53:43,584
Do what you feel like.

654
00:53:45,322 --> 00:53:47,450
<i>I tremble like a bridge in the rain.</i>

655
00:53:48,191 --> 00:53:50,455
<i>In the deep jungle of your gaze.</i>

656
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:52,859
<i>I lose my way, no trail to blaze.</i>

657
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:56,495
<i>I never thought about it.</i>
I <i>like</i> them <i>all.</i>

658
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:59,900
<i>How can you like all the seasons?</i>

659
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:02,229
<i>I like the monsoons!</i>

660
00:54:11,715 --> 00:54:13,410
You recorded her voice?

661
00:54:13,483 --> 00:54:14,245
Brilliant!

662
00:54:14,317 --> 00:54:16,115
First, I recorded it on my phone...

663
00:54:16,186 --> 00:54:18,245
then I cued songs
based on her words.

664
00:54:18,321 --> 00:54:21,655
Well done! The student
has become the master!

665
00:54:22,659 --> 00:54:24,024
That's a smart gift, bro!

666
00:54:26,129 --> 00:54:27,927
Dude, she's from an upper-caste.

667
00:54:28,465 --> 00:54:30,058
Don't get too emotional about her.

668
00:54:30,166 --> 00:54:31,964
Does she know
you're from a lower caste?

669
00:54:36,139 --> 00:54:38,574
Let her know about it,
then do as you please.

670
00:54:38,842 --> 00:54:40,833
Not everyone is progressive.

671
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:43,811
OK, I'll tell her later.

672
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:48,641
Come on!
There's lot of time for that.

673
00:54:48,718 --> 00:54:50,982
When he gets a job,
none of this will matter.

674
00:54:51,054 --> 00:54:53,489
- Give him your motorbike keys.
- Why?

675
00:54:53,857 --> 00:54:55,518
He has one more surprise for her.

676
00:54:55,692 --> 00:54:57,990
Give the keys!
He'll pay you for the fuel.

677
00:54:59,195 --> 00:55:00,321
First word.

678
00:55:01,097 --> 00:55:02,292
Plant?

679
00:55:02,999 --> 00:55:03,522
Lamp?

680
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:04,691
Bowl!

681
00:55:18,014 --> 00:55:19,243
DeePak!

682
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:21,250
It's a ﬂower, not Deepak.

683
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:22,410
DeePak!

684
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,172
Where to?

685
00:55:51,948 --> 00:55:53,473
Wherever you want.

686
00:55:54,084 --> 00:55:55,313
Get on.

687
00:55:56,753 --> 00:55:57,584
Your bag?

688
00:55:57,687 --> 00:55:58,586
Sorry!

689
00:56:00,123 --> 00:56:02,091
- Shall I sit?
- Yes, sure.

690
00:56:05,762 --> 00:56:08,129
You know what we
boys call your bus?

691
00:56:08,298 --> 00:56:09,129
What?

692
00:56:09,332 --> 00:56:10,629
Chick-Wagon!

693
00:56:16,106 --> 00:56:17,437
<i>What is this?</i>

694
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:21,669
- Is it an eraser?
- Yes.

695
00:56:24,347 --> 00:56:27,112
You have ﬁnal year
Civil Engineering books?

696
00:56:27,183 --> 00:56:28,173
No sir.

697
00:56:29,319 --> 00:56:31,014
- Concrete design?
- No sir.

698
00:56:31,121 --> 00:56:32,782
- Structure analysis?
- No sir.

699
00:56:33,189 --> 00:56:34,657
You got all your books?

700
00:56:35,992 --> 00:56:37,653
Pack these please!

701
00:56:51,508 --> 00:56:53,272
You never told me where you live.

702
00:57:00,016 --> 00:57:01,108
You know Bhelupur?

703
00:57:01,217 --> 00:57:03,652
- Bhelupur?
- Right after that.

704
00:57:03,953 --> 00:57:05,785
My friend Prerna lives there

705
00:57:07,023 --> 00:57:09,458
I'll say I'm going there and
I'll visit you.

706
00:57:09,526 --> 00:57:11,221
Great idea, right?

707
00:57:14,164 --> 00:57:15,632
You'll come to my house?

708
00:57:16,166 --> 00:57:19,158
I mean... your parents won't mind?

709
00:57:21,337 --> 00:57:22,827
If you don't feel like it, I won't.

710
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:26,136
No, I didn't mean that.

711
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:33,943
Hey, hold this for a second.

712
00:57:38,154 --> 00:57:39,815
This is your birthday gift.

713
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:45,152
Put them on.

714
00:57:53,336 --> 00:57:54,497
Is it audible?

715
00:57:58,675 --> 00:57:59,801
Thank you.

716
00:58:38,314 --> 00:58:40,009
Have you ever been to Sangam?

717
00:58:41,718 --> 00:58:43,277
I come here often.

718
00:58:50,927 --> 00:58:54,295
In few days we'll be off on
a pilgrimage in a bus.

719
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:57,527
ALL OF US: Uncle, aunt,
grandpa, and grandma.

720
00:58:58,568 --> 00:58:59,694
Will you come along?

721
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:02,360
- Where?
- With us.

722
00:59:02,438 --> 00:59:03,462
With you?

723
00:59:08,311 --> 00:59:10,075
I'll have to think about it.

724
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:31,290
What is it?

725
00:59:31,634 --> 00:59:34,160
You must be the youngest
in your family, right?

726
00:59:35,605 --> 00:59:37,903
Right! How did you know?

727
00:59:39,475 --> 00:59:42,274
The youngest are always chatterboxes.

728
00:59:45,615 --> 00:59:48,448
That hurts! Your hand is
like a hammer!

729
00:59:48,518 --> 00:59:49,781
It's the ring.

730
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:54,253
My uncle gave it to me
when I was a kid.

731
00:59:54,791 --> 00:59:56,281
It's stuck now.

732
00:59:56,492 --> 00:59:57,982
My ﬁngers grew...

733
00:59:58,127 --> 00:59:59,925
the ring stayed the same.

734
00:59:59,996 --> 01:00:03,728
Everybody loves me
because I'm the youngest.

735
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:08,933
What is it?

736
01:00:09,872 --> 01:00:11,169
I don't know.

737
01:00:26,089 --> 01:00:29,719
You're the youngest, right?
So I kissed you.

738
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:43,359
Shaalu.

739
01:01:45,568 --> 01:01:47,161
Will you marry me?

740
01:01:51,407 --> 01:01:53,034
I don't know.

741
01:01:56,212 --> 01:01:57,839
Will your folks agree?

742
01:01:59,015 --> 01:02:00,244
I don't know.

743
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:02,613
You want to meet them?

744
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:04,416
Will you introduce me?

745
01:02:05,455 --> 01:02:07,549
You won't tell me where you live...

746
01:02:07,657 --> 01:02:10,251
but you are in a hurry to
come to my place?

747
01:02:33,082 --> 01:02:35,813
- Shall I go?
- You stay near by?

748
01:02:37,186 --> 01:02:40,383
Around the corner,
the house on the left.

749
01:02:42,492 --> 01:02:43,891
Where's your house?

750
01:02:44,827 --> 01:02:47,023
You said it was near Belupur...

751
01:02:47,396 --> 01:02:48,693
Shivala?

752
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,525
Kamacha!

753
01:02:52,869 --> 01:02:54,564
OK, I got it.

754
01:02:54,837 --> 01:02:56,862
- Durgakund, right?
- Why?

755
01:02:57,774 --> 01:02:58,969
What's bothering you?

756
01:03:00,543 --> 01:03:04,844
I told you I stay near Bhelupur.
You have nothing else to talk about?

757
01:03:05,414 --> 01:03:06,506
I was just joking.

758
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:08,175
You think this is funny?

759
01:03:09,051 --> 01:03:12,180
Want to know where I live?
Come, I'll take you.

760
01:03:14,524 --> 01:03:18,358
Come, let me take you there and
curb your curiosity!

761
01:03:19,028 --> 01:03:20,359
You want the truth?

762
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:23,694
I live by Harischchandra Ghat.
I was born and raised there.

763
01:03:23,966 --> 01:03:26,560
We burn bodies, light pyres.

764
01:03:26,836 --> 01:03:29,498
Me, my father, my uncles,
my brother... all of us, for ages.

765
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:32,365
Ever see a body burn?

766
01:03:33,142 --> 01:03:35,133
Tell me, have you?

767
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:39,582
I see them all day, every day.
I burn the dead, day and night.

768
01:03:40,183 --> 01:03:44,142
In the ﬁre, the skin melts
and all that's left is the bones.

769
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:48,987
We smash the skull
and wash the ashes into the Ganges.

770
01:03:49,058 --> 01:03:52,187
Can you imagine?
Want to come and see?

771
01:03:52,962 --> 01:03:55,397
What happened? Won't you use
your friend's pretext now?

772
01:04:12,615 --> 01:04:14,413
Where's my tip?

773
01:04:15,318 --> 01:04:15,978
Why?

774
01:04:16,185 --> 01:04:20,645
An employment letter from the
government deserves a good tip.

775
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:48,480
You're the new employee right?

776
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:49,950
Yes.

777
01:04:50,152 --> 01:04:51,483
Please have a seat.

778
01:05:17,113 --> 01:05:19,980
Just 2 minutes later...

779
01:05:20,449 --> 01:05:22,816
and you could have ﬁlled
my water bottle too

780
01:05:23,786 --> 01:05:25,015
I'm Sadhya.

781
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:26,513
Hello.

782
01:05:27,056 --> 01:05:29,525
The railway has printed a great guide.

783
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:36,524
We had to learn without
books, the hard way!

784
01:05:39,969 --> 01:05:40,993
Look at this...

785
01:05:41,070 --> 01:05:43,334
This is Mr. Mukherjee.

786
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:46,206
He used to work here
before you joined.

787
01:05:46,709 --> 01:05:48,677
He refused to learn computers.

788
01:05:48,744 --> 01:05:50,974
- May I use this?
- Yes, sure.

789
01:05:51,981 --> 01:05:56,350
Railways relocated him to a remote
area in Rajasthan.

790
01:05:57,386 --> 01:06:00,014
Now he issues train tickets manually.

791
01:06:01,824 --> 01:06:04,316
You must be well trained
in computers?

792
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:05,761
Yes.

793
01:06:05,828 --> 01:06:07,091
Very nice.

794
01:06:07,263 --> 01:06:08,094
Ticket!

795
01:06:08,397 --> 01:06:09,159
Good morning.

796
01:06:09,265 --> 01:06:11,029
- Where to?
- Lalpur.

797
01:06:30,186 --> 01:06:32,678
<i>Shaalu, aunt is calling you.</i>

798
01:06:46,736 --> 01:06:47,726
You know...

799
01:06:47,937 --> 01:06:50,304
you're not like the other boys!

800
01:06:50,373 --> 01:06:52,034
Really? How?

801
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:54,970
There is a certain
sense of honesty in you.

802
01:06:55,745 --> 01:06:58,146
Like the honesty in
Nida Fazli's poetry.

803
01:06:59,148 --> 01:07:01,412
Now who is this Nida Fazli?

804
01:07:03,486 --> 01:07:05,454
That's how honest you are!

805
01:07:09,992 --> 01:07:11,118
The food was delicious...

806
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:12,689
but the salad was stale.

807
01:07:12,928 --> 01:07:14,794
Even the lentils were brilliant.

808
01:07:15,297 --> 01:07:18,597
It better be.
The owner's from our caste.

809
01:07:47,329 --> 01:07:48,660
<i>So, you finally called, huh?</i>

810
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:50,529
It was you who
overreacted that day...

811
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:52,132
and now you're mad at me?

812
01:07:53,302 --> 01:07:54,497
<i>Sorry!</i>

813
01:07:54,870 --> 01:07:56,929
I didn't ask for an apology.

814
01:07:57,473 --> 01:07:59,635
- I'm so stupid!
- That's true

815
01:07:59,708 --> 01:08:01,642
I have no manners.

816
01:08:02,144 --> 01:08:03,612
Even that is true!

817
01:08:05,147 --> 01:08:06,581
Where've you reached?

818
01:08:06,782 --> 01:08:08,750
<i>Haven't even crossed the state yet.</i>

819
01:08:08,818 --> 01:08:10,217
<i>Near the border.</i>

820
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:12,016
OK, listen...

821
01:08:13,122 --> 01:08:14,612
My parents...

822
01:08:15,624 --> 01:08:16,682
they...

823
01:08:17,326 --> 01:08:19,260
they'll never approve of you.

824
01:08:20,463 --> 01:08:24,422
<i>They're stuck in the past
with their old-fashioned ideas.</i>

825
01:08:25,601 --> 01:08:27,399
But I'm with you.

826
01:08:28,504 --> 01:08:31,098
With time, parents
do come around.

827
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:34,243
<i>Just get yourself a good job.</i>

828
01:08:36,545 --> 01:08:39,446
Yes, I'm doing my best.

829
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:44,711
Placements season is approaching.
I will do my best!

830
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:47,546
That's the spirit!
I'll handle the rest.

831
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:53,494
If it comes to it,
I'll run away with you.

832
01:08:54,697 --> 01:08:56,495
<i>OK, lake care! Bye!</i>

833
01:09:10,379 --> 01:09:12,143
Hey man! Let's go back!

834
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:13,744
We just came in!

835
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:15,875
I have a lot to study.

836
01:09:16,685 --> 01:09:18,244
Hey, turn the boat around.

837
01:09:20,422 --> 01:09:22,618
Sir... extra sheet, please.

838
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:24,952
Thank you

839
01:09:25,594 --> 01:09:28,256
I'm doing my ﬁnal year
in civil engineering...

840
01:09:28,464 --> 01:09:31,331
from Seth Kinaram Agarwal
Polytechnique College.

841
01:09:31,433 --> 01:09:35,028
My career objective is to
pursue a career in engineering...

842
01:09:35,271 --> 01:09:37,899
with focus on mechanical drafting.

843
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:42,008
DEEPAK: Can't wait to see you.
I'm about to get a job!

844
01:09:56,325 --> 01:09:58,191
Shove the skull inside

845
01:10:00,696 --> 01:10:02,687
I'll go get Deepak to help.

846
01:10:05,434 --> 01:10:06,026
Hey, Deepak.

847
01:10:06,135 --> 01:10:07,534
- What is it?
- Hurry up.

848
01:10:07,636 --> 01:10:10,628
Dad's drunk again and there
are lots of bodies to burn.

849
01:10:11,507 --> 01:10:12,668
Wake up!

850
01:10:16,979 --> 01:10:18,640
<i>Everybody wants to avoid
work in</i> this family!

851
01:10:19,081 --> 01:10:20,879
<i>I'm bloody tired of this</i>
bonded <i>labor!</i>

852
01:10:21,483 --> 01:10:22,541
<i>Hell, Deepak!</i>

853
01:10:39,602 --> 01:10:40,763
Wait up, you thief!

854
01:10:40,869 --> 01:10:44,703
One more time and I'll
throw you in these pyres!

855
01:10:58,887 --> 01:11:01,356
They have not even covered
the bodies properly.

856
01:11:01,690 --> 01:11:04,523
Shambu! Light some pyres there

857
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:06,050
I'm on it.

858
01:11:06,161 --> 01:11:07,788
Bathe this one ﬁrst.

859
01:11:08,063 --> 01:11:09,326
DeePak!

860
01:11:13,202 --> 01:11:16,832
Light some pyres over there and
then some more over there.

861
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:17,997
There?

862
01:11:18,073 --> 01:11:20,337
Near the edge.
As many as you can.

863
01:11:20,442 --> 01:11:22,809
- Shall I ﬁnish here ﬁrst?
- Yes.

864
01:11:33,689 --> 01:11:35,555
More sawdust!

865
01:11:51,106 --> 01:11:54,371
Sikandar needs more wood.
Go help him.

866
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:07,646
Deepak! Give us a hand.

867
01:12:23,272 --> 01:12:24,671
Be careful.

868
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:28,337
Easy.

869
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:33,474
Did the cops say anything?

870
01:12:33,882 --> 01:12:38,376
That the pilgrims' bus fell
into the Ganges.

871
01:12:38,821 --> 01:12:39,549
Really?

872
01:12:39,655 --> 01:12:42,488
Public aid workers dumped
all the bodies here.

873
01:12:43,225 --> 01:12:44,852
Not a single survivor?

874
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:45,984
No.

875
01:14:54,089 --> 01:14:55,454
You know...

876
01:14:57,326 --> 01:14:59,351
28 trains stop at this station.

877
01:14:59,862 --> 01:15:01,296
Guess how many don't?

878
01:15:03,699 --> 01:15:04,928
64!

879
01:15:06,468 --> 01:15:08,596
Which means, it's
easy to come here...

880
01:15:08,971 --> 01:15:10,496
but it's difﬁcult to leave!

881
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:29,817
Could you check
the status of this ticket?

882
01:15:30,158 --> 01:15:31,319
<i>Listen... l know it was fun.</i>

883
01:15:31,426 --> 01:15:32,689
But we need to get back now.

884
01:15:32,794 --> 01:15:33,920
One more day.

885
01:15:34,129 --> 01:15:35,563
Not conﬁrmed yet.

886
01:15:35,664 --> 01:15:38,258
Could you check the last
minute availabilities?

887
01:15:38,333 --> 01:15:40,358
Even one seat for both of us is ﬁne.

888
01:15:40,969 --> 01:15:42,368
One seat? I like that...

889
01:15:52,981 --> 01:15:54,039
No seats available.

890
01:15:54,516 --> 01:15:56,382
- Any cancellations?
- None whatsoever!

891
01:16:00,589 --> 01:16:04,457
Come and see this amazing competition!

892
01:16:04,526 --> 01:16:06,392
Never before seen!

893
01:16:06,461 --> 01:16:07,428
Jhonta!

894
01:16:07,696 --> 01:16:09,528
And now, ladies and gentlemen...

895
01:16:09,631 --> 01:16:11,326
these kids will dive.

896
01:16:11,433 --> 01:16:12,332
Jhonta!

897
01:16:12,434 --> 01:16:15,768
He's not here. Bet on someone else.

898
01:16:16,471 --> 01:16:19,133
Put your money on Babua.
He's sure to win!

899
01:16:19,675 --> 01:16:20,665
Put it on Babua.

900
01:16:20,776 --> 01:16:22,141
- How much?
- 200 Rupees.

901
01:16:22,244 --> 01:16:24,178
Professor bets 200 on Babua!

902
01:16:24,279 --> 01:16:27,044
Get ready

903
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:28,440
1...

904
01:16:28,517 --> 01:16:29,541
2...

905
01:16:33,322 --> 01:16:35,654
- Can you see anything in my mouth?
- No!

906
01:16:35,724 --> 01:16:38,284
Now I'll put this ball in my mouth.
Watch closely!

907
01:16:48,370 --> 01:16:50,839
Now... 1... 2... and...

908
01:16:56,078 --> 01:16:57,705
Here's your share.

909
01:16:57,813 --> 01:17:00,976
- I deserve at least 500 Rupees.
- We'll adjust it next time.

910
01:17:03,285 --> 01:17:04,878
How much did you lose?

911
01:17:22,170 --> 01:17:23,535
Look how late it is!

912
01:17:31,313 --> 01:17:32,803
Do you hear me?

913
01:17:33,448 --> 01:17:35,007
Turned mute, have you?

914
01:17:37,252 --> 01:17:38,151
Where were you?

915
01:17:38,253 --> 01:17:39,243
Having fun.

916
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:43,656
Are you hereto work or have fun?

917
01:17:43,992 --> 01:17:46,461
I'm having fun with my own money!
Why is your ass on ﬁre?

918
01:17:46,528 --> 01:17:47,518
Shut up!

919
01:17:47,829 --> 01:17:50,127
Those other orphan kids
have ruined you.

920
01:17:50,198 --> 01:17:51,723
Show some respect!

921
01:17:54,636 --> 01:17:57,537
You will not go anywhere
during a competition.

922
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:00,008
Acting like the king of Banaras!

923
01:18:00,375 --> 01:18:01,570
Throwing money down the drain!

924
01:18:01,643 --> 01:18:02,872
I'll tell Devi!

925
01:18:02,944 --> 01:18:05,072
Do what you want.

926
01:18:05,947 --> 01:18:07,574
Sit your butt here!

927
01:18:07,983 --> 01:18:09,417
Don't you dare move.

928
01:18:10,419 --> 01:18:11,614
Sit down!

929
01:18:12,654 --> 01:18:13,883
Such arrogance!

930
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:17,159
From now on,
I want all your winnings.

931
01:18:32,974 --> 01:18:36,274
<i>The internship discussion topic is...</i>

932
01:18:36,678 --> 01:18:39,545
the effects of industrialization...

933
01:18:40,449 --> 01:18:42,611
on human life and on society at large.

934
01:19:13,815 --> 01:19:15,476
Say something, Deepak.

935
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:21,317
You've been quiet for
a really longtime.

936
01:19:25,694 --> 01:19:28,686
No, it's okay. Take your time

937
01:19:32,834 --> 01:19:34,825
"l like poetry..."

938
01:19:42,944 --> 01:19:45,641
"You move like the
misty morning train..."

939
01:19:47,949 --> 01:19:50,611
I tremble like a bridge in the rain".

940
01:20:14,576 --> 01:20:17,307
"If it comes to that,
I'll run away with you."

941
01:20:36,765 --> 01:20:39,291
When does this grief ever end?

942
01:20:50,679 --> 01:20:53,114
Deepak, get up!

943
01:20:58,887 --> 01:21:00,355
You're being crazy!

944
01:21:10,332 --> 01:21:13,461
You need to control yourself.

945
01:21:17,939 --> 01:21:21,466
Hey Deepak, take my bike keys.

946
01:21:23,078 --> 01:21:24,546
Shaalu!!!

947
01:21:48,503 --> 01:21:50,767
You promised the translation
would be done by today.

948
01:21:51,206 --> 01:21:53,072
The printers are sitting idle.

949
01:21:53,909 --> 01:21:55,070
Mr. Pathak?

950
01:21:55,844 --> 01:21:57,243
Is everything OK?

951
01:21:59,915 --> 01:22:01,508
I'll deliver it within 3 days

952
01:22:01,783 --> 01:22:03,273
3 more days?

953
01:22:03,351 --> 01:22:05,410
Devi's not keeping
well these days.

954
01:22:08,456 --> 01:22:10,117
Mr. Verma...

955
01:22:11,159 --> 01:22:13,127
could you give me an
advance please?

956
01:22:13,194 --> 01:22:16,528
You've already kept me
hanging like a bat.

957
01:22:18,333 --> 01:22:21,200
<i>Still, I can't say no.</i>

958
01:22:21,636 --> 01:22:23,070
Here you go.

959
01:22:24,572 --> 01:22:25,562
It's ﬁne.

960
01:22:26,341 --> 01:22:27,467
Good bye!

961
01:22:37,319 --> 01:22:39,754
Sorry for the delay!

962
01:22:49,164 --> 01:22:50,359
How much is this?

963
01:22:53,168 --> 01:22:54,829
30,000 Rupees for now...

964
01:23:00,508 --> 01:23:01,634
Come with me.

965
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:10,674
See that gate over there?

966
01:23:12,253 --> 01:23:12,845
Yes.

967
01:23:12,954 --> 01:23:15,013
There's a shop opposite.

968
01:23:15,690 --> 01:23:17,180
"Pappu scrap dealer."

969
01:23:17,492 --> 01:23:20,052
Sell this crappy old engine
for 10 or 15,000 Rupees.

970
01:23:21,129 --> 01:23:23,257
The thing is we are trying...

971
01:23:23,331 --> 01:23:26,266
I think we'll be able to complete
the payment soon.

972
01:23:26,334 --> 01:23:27,961
You think this is a joke?

973
01:23:31,673 --> 01:23:33,368
This is not enough.

974
01:23:34,976 --> 01:23:36,876
Are you a child?

975
01:23:37,145 --> 01:23:39,739
I'll pay the rest this week.

976
01:23:40,448 --> 01:23:41,882
Please take this.

977
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:51,550
You better clear it this week...

978
01:23:51,726 --> 01:23:53,524
and complete the balance
by next month.

979
01:24:06,975 --> 01:24:07,908
Money?

980
01:24:12,247 --> 01:24:13,715
Please hurry, sir!

981
01:24:15,283 --> 01:24:17,183
- Where to?
- Howrah.

982
01:24:17,285 --> 01:24:18,252
As a "Devi"...

983
01:24:18,319 --> 01:24:20,617
you should have 4 arms on each side

984
01:24:21,189 --> 01:24:23,783
8 tickets in record speed!

985
01:24:26,327 --> 01:24:28,056
Sir, please hurry.

986
01:24:28,430 --> 01:24:30,194
What's the rush?

987
01:24:34,202 --> 01:24:36,000
My father says...

988
01:24:36,171 --> 01:24:37,730
if you haven't tasted kheer...

989
01:24:38,173 --> 01:24:41,370
you're missing one of life's
greatest pleasures.

990
01:24:43,812 --> 01:24:45,075
Here, have some.

991
01:24:45,980 --> 01:24:47,038
No, you have it.

992
01:24:47,148 --> 01:24:48,582
That goes without saying.

993
01:24:49,184 --> 01:24:51,209
Father's cooked it himself.

994
01:24:51,686 --> 01:24:52,983
It's his birthday today.

995
01:24:54,189 --> 01:24:55,156
Oh, OK.

996
01:25:02,263 --> 01:25:03,697
Wow - Isn't it delicious?

997
01:25:03,798 --> 01:25:04,788
Yes very.

998
01:25:12,807 --> 01:25:14,241
Do you live alone?

999
01:25:14,442 --> 01:25:16,536
No, I live with my father.

1000
01:25:17,045 --> 01:25:18,535
Father lives alone

1001
01:25:21,483 --> 01:25:23,349
I mean, he's alone during the day.

1002
01:25:30,492 --> 01:25:31,960
'Kheer"?

1003
01:25:33,661 --> 01:25:36,460
Haven't cooked it in
a while, so I thought...

1004
01:25:38,366 --> 01:25:41,529
l just had dinner. Keep it,
I'll have it tomorrow.

1005
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:46,535
Have it, please.

1006
01:25:48,543 --> 01:25:50,443
You're so fond of it.

1007
01:25:57,886 --> 01:25:59,183
It's good.

1008
01:26:00,155 --> 01:26:01,987
Is there any milk left for
tomorrow morning?

1009
01:26:04,526 --> 01:26:05,516
What is it?

1010
01:26:05,927 --> 01:26:08,225
I completed a month
at work today. So...

1011
01:26:08,429 --> 01:26:09,794
it's my salary cheque.

1012
01:26:11,132 --> 01:26:12,531
How much?

1013
01:26:12,634 --> 01:26:13,965
20 thousand Rupees.

1014
01:26:15,537 --> 01:26:16,902
Great!

1015
01:26:18,940 --> 01:26:20,408
Come, sit next to me.

1016
01:26:25,547 --> 01:26:28,141
You never told me your
job was conﬁrmed.

1017
01:26:29,117 --> 01:26:30,607
It's temporary

1018
01:26:31,286 --> 01:26:34,688
I'll work until we arrange
the ransom money.

1019
01:26:34,989 --> 01:26:35,854
Then...

1020
01:26:35,957 --> 01:26:37,049
And then?

1021
01:26:43,932 --> 01:26:47,459
I'm planning to take up a
course at Allahabad university

1022
01:26:48,803 --> 01:26:52,137
I'll work part-time
near the university.

1023
01:26:52,340 --> 01:26:54,138
You want to move out?

1024
01:27:02,750 --> 01:27:03,876
Yes.

1025
01:27:05,653 --> 01:27:06,814
Why?

1026
01:27:08,489 --> 01:27:10,981
If it wasn't for this <i>case,</i>
I would have already left.

1027
01:27:16,231 --> 01:27:18,495
Maybe I'm better off alone.

1028
01:27:19,334 --> 01:27:20,961
Allahabad isn't too far.

1029
01:27:21,269 --> 01:27:23,636
- I'll come back here once in a while.
- What about your father?

1030
01:27:31,312 --> 01:27:33,440
I don't ﬁt in your life anywhere?

1031
01:27:38,152 --> 01:27:40,678
If you've ﬁgured out so much then...

1032
01:27:42,457 --> 01:27:43,515
Go

1033
01:27:46,995 --> 01:27:49,430
I did not kill your mother!

1034
01:27:54,569 --> 01:27:57,061
I'll quietly sleep on the ghat!

1035
01:28:00,275 --> 01:28:01,902
Father, please!

1036
01:28:06,748 --> 01:28:08,580
Don't cry, please.

1037
01:31:12,166 --> 01:31:15,329
Narrow gauges are still used
in hilly areas.

1038
01:31:15,837 --> 01:31:20,206
Broad-gauge technology
will eventually replace it.

1039
01:31:20,675 --> 01:31:23,076
- Graduated ﬁrst in your class?
- Yes.

1040
01:31:23,478 --> 01:31:25,947
You're hired for a six-month trial
in Allahabad.

1041
01:31:26,881 --> 01:31:28,815
Thank you, sir - Congratulations.

1042
01:32:00,181 --> 01:32:02,548
<i>Now we're on it completely.</i>

1043
01:32:05,620 --> 01:32:08,555
Even Devi's now got a temporary job

1044
01:32:12,159 --> 01:32:14,685
I have a feeling we'll
pay the dues soon

1045
01:32:17,732 --> 01:32:20,497
6th of the next month
is your last day to pay up.

1046
01:32:22,470 --> 01:32:24,529
Or else the video's going up
on YouTube

1047
01:32:26,274 --> 01:32:28,072
I'm sure you know
what YouTube is?

1048
01:32:37,084 --> 01:32:38,574
Dad, shall we leave?

1049
01:32:44,225 --> 01:32:45,590
Yes, let's go.

1050
01:32:50,531 --> 01:32:53,159
<i>Today on the eve of Maha Shivratri.</i>

1051
01:32:53,234 --> 01:32:55,566
We <i>will</i> have the
biggest competition till date.

1052
01:32:55,670 --> 01:32:56,967
<i>So on this note.</i>

1053
01:32:57,038 --> 01:32:59,234
All hail in the name of...
Lord Mahadev!

1054
01:32:59,340 --> 01:33:01,274
All okay?

1055
01:33:01,909 --> 01:33:04,344
Take down my bet - How much?

1056
01:33:05,046 --> 01:33:06,275
10,000 Rupees.

1057
01:33:06,347 --> 01:33:09,044
- You'll win right?
- Obviously!

1058
01:33:14,055 --> 01:33:16,149
Did you know Devi...

1059
01:33:18,192 --> 01:33:21,162
there's always one
friend in every group...

1060
01:33:21,495 --> 01:33:23,463
who is considered the most wise.

1061
01:33:23,864 --> 01:33:24,456
Yes.

1062
01:33:24,532 --> 01:33:27,934
Back in college... I used
to be that intellectual.

1063
01:33:30,972 --> 01:33:34,670
All my friends used to seek
my help with their problems.

1064
01:33:35,142 --> 01:33:37,133
My advice to everyone...

1065
01:33:37,678 --> 01:33:41,046
whatever is in your heart,
say it out loud!

1066
01:33:41,148 --> 01:33:43,344
Hiding will get you nothing.

1067
01:33:53,060 --> 01:33:55,859
<i>Let's see who is going to win today!</i>

1068
01:33:56,364 --> 01:33:57,991
Jhonta, dive there!

1069
01:34:01,435 --> 01:34:03,096
Hurry up! Faster!

1070
01:34:04,505 --> 01:34:05,529
On the extreme end.

1071
01:34:07,308 --> 01:34:09,834
Now that you're leaving...

1072
01:34:10,277 --> 01:34:14,339
I think it's time I should
listen to the "intellectual" inside me...

1073
01:34:15,316 --> 01:34:19,685
and tell you what is in my heart.

1074
01:34:25,860 --> 01:34:26,793
Jhonta!

1075
01:34:32,066 --> 01:34:33,056
Jhonta!

1076
01:34:34,735 --> 01:34:36,635
Dive, Munna!

1077
01:34:42,009 --> 01:34:43,204
Everything okay?

1078
01:34:45,946 --> 01:34:47,038
<i>Sorry</i>

1079
01:34:48,015 --> 01:34:49,540
I have to leave.

1080
01:34:59,593 --> 01:35:01,687
Give way, move!

1081
01:35:01,796 --> 01:35:03,821
Everybody move from here!

1082
01:35:03,931 --> 01:35:04,898
Give way!

1083
01:35:06,701 --> 01:35:07,964
Jhonta!!!

1084
01:35:08,035 --> 01:35:10,902
I won't ever let you play
this game, my child!

1085
01:35:31,058 --> 01:35:31,957
What?

1086
01:35:32,026 --> 01:35:34,290
I lost all your money, isn't it?

1087
01:35:36,363 --> 01:35:37,159
No.

1088
01:36:01,956 --> 01:36:03,082
What happened?

1089
01:36:03,591 --> 01:36:05,423
Want to see a magic trick?

1090
01:36:07,528 --> 01:36:09,394
Do you see anything in my hand?

1091
01:36:11,632 --> 01:36:14,260
Anything in this one?

1092
01:36:14,502 --> 01:36:15,469
No.

1093
01:36:15,669 --> 01:36:17,535
Anything in my mouth?

1094
01:36:22,176 --> 01:36:24,167
1...2... 3...

1095
01:36:32,153 --> 01:36:33,177
Whose is it?

1096
01:36:33,454 --> 01:36:34,785
It's for you.

1097
01:36:35,956 --> 01:36:36,855
Where did you ﬁnd it?

1098
01:36:36,957 --> 01:36:39,722
Found it in the river
while diving.

1099
01:36:58,078 --> 01:36:59,477
Yes, great!

1100
01:37:04,585 --> 01:37:05,575
Thank you.

1101
01:37:44,992 --> 01:37:46,050
It's hot!

1102
01:37:47,061 --> 01:37:49,291
I've packed lunch.
Have it on the train.

1103
01:37:49,463 --> 01:37:50,931
You eat, I'll pack.

1104
01:38:00,875 --> 01:38:02,274
It's lovely.

1105
01:38:13,020 --> 01:38:14,215
Shall we go?

1106
01:38:25,532 --> 01:38:26,658
Blessings.

1107
01:38:26,767 --> 01:38:28,292
Call me once you reach

1108
01:38:29,603 --> 01:38:31,401
I'm off - Hurry up.

1109
01:38:31,839 --> 01:38:33,136
Step back.

1110
01:38:40,114 --> 01:38:42,515
Go sit - See you soon, Dad.

1111
01:39:43,944 --> 01:39:45,173
Hello!

1112
01:39:46,046 --> 01:39:48,845
I'm hereto see Mr. Ramdhari Agarwal

1113
01:39:49,249 --> 01:39:51,047
I am Devi Pathak.

1114
01:39:51,919 --> 01:39:55,412
Piyush was my friend. That day...

1115
01:39:55,489 --> 01:39:58,254
Hold on. It's better we talk inside!

1116
01:40:25,152 --> 01:40:28,452
- What are you doing? Are you crazy?
- Why have you come here?

1117
01:40:28,522 --> 01:40:29,990
Are you okay?

1118
01:40:31,058 --> 01:40:32,150
Why?

1119
01:40:32,726 --> 01:40:34,751
What harm did he ever do to you?

1120
01:42:27,141 --> 01:42:28,438
Water?

1121
01:43:11,351 --> 01:43:14,252
30 rupees to go to Sangam!

1122
01:43:15,455 --> 01:43:16,945
Come on, miss!

1123
01:43:17,457 --> 01:43:18,856
And you, sir?

1124
01:43:19,126 --> 01:43:20,651
I'll take you to Sangam.

1125
01:44:15,148 --> 01:44:17,014
Is this your ﬁrst visit to Sangam?

1126
01:44:17,451 --> 01:44:18,441
Yes.

1127
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:20,978
And you?

1128
01:44:21,822 --> 01:44:23,119
Second time.

1129
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:29,122
Someone once said you must visit
Sangam twice in a lifetime.

1130
01:44:29,663 --> 01:44:30,630
Why?

1131
01:44:30,697 --> 01:44:32,995
Alone the ﬁrst time, and with
someone the second time around

1132
01:44:33,019 --> 01:44:49,019
<font color="#ffff80"><b>Hope it helped -> bozxphd</b></font>
