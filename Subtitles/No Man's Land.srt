00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,400
Fuck me, if he knows where we are.

3
00:01:58,069 --> 00:01:59,468
You said it.

4
00:02:00,438 --> 00:02:03,066
At least he hasn't led us to the enemy.

5
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:12,081
Guys, we'll wait until the fog lifts.

6
00:02:13,285 --> 00:02:15,378
It's too risky to carry on.

7
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,484
With you, even drinking coffee is risky.

8
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:23,684
What a guide!

9
00:02:24,396 --> 00:02:26,796
You try to do better in this fog!

10
00:02:27,032 --> 00:02:30,024
Listen to him! He's always happy.

11
00:02:30,769 --> 00:02:32,566
The eternal optimist.

12
00:02:33,538 --> 00:02:36,632
Know the difference between
a pessimist and an optimist?

13
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:40,504
- No, what?
- A pessimist thinks things can't be worse.

14
00:02:40,578 --> 00:02:43,206
An optimist knows they can.

15
00:02:47,052 --> 00:02:51,546
You and your crap jokes.
No one else finds them funny.

16
00:02:52,223 --> 00:02:55,056
If you had any brains at all, you'd give up.

17
00:02:55,493 --> 00:02:58,792
Oh, yeah? If I had any, I wouldn't be here.

18
00:02:59,331 --> 00:03:02,561
I'd be a general or a UN official.

19
00:03:02,667 --> 00:03:05,898
Or I'd open a restaurant.
What's that look for?

20
00:03:10,642 --> 00:03:14,476
It would help my budget
if you smoked your own.

21
00:03:14,746 --> 00:03:18,705
<i>- Since you're offering...
- Who the fuck am I? Mother Teresa?</i>

22
00:03:22,754 --> 00:03:24,688
Are you crazy?

23
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:27,158
You want them to see us?

24
00:03:27,225 --> 00:03:30,489
Who's going to see us?
I can't even see my feet.

25
00:03:30,562 --> 00:03:33,326
Put those cigarettes out! Put them out!

26
00:03:52,751 --> 00:03:53,911
Hair in place?

27
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,663
He's something else!

28
00:04:11,503 --> 00:04:15,303
First time at the front
and he dozes off before we get there.

29
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:17,975
<i>Kids these days...</i>

30
00:04:25,417 --> 00:04:26,508
What?

31
00:04:37,462 --> 00:04:41,921
- Any idea where we are?
- I reckon we should be there by now.

32
00:04:44,035 --> 00:04:47,027
Dawn will soon be here and it'll be easier.

33
00:04:47,705 --> 00:04:52,698
I never took a relief squad
to the front at night before.

34
00:04:55,013 --> 00:04:56,537
<i>We got lucky...</i>

35
00:06:00,712 --> 00:06:01,644
Look!

36
00:06:03,915 --> 00:06:05,007
Look!

37
00:06:35,713 --> 00:06:36,873
<i>Shit...</i>

38
00:06:38,183 --> 00:06:39,514
Run!

39
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:17,616
SERBIAN LINES

40
00:07:17,722 --> 00:07:20,691
You think they were trying
to take back the trench?

41
00:07:21,192 --> 00:07:23,183
No, I don't think so.

42
00:07:23,828 --> 00:07:27,354
- I think a relief squad got lost.
- Check it!

43
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,762
Yes, sir!

44
00:07:34,706 --> 00:07:37,539
BOSNIAN LINES

45
00:07:37,609 --> 00:07:39,099
What happened?

46
00:07:39,777 --> 00:07:42,438
Our relief squad got lost in the fog.

47
00:07:44,115 --> 00:07:46,913
- Are there any survivors?
- Shit!

48
00:07:52,357 --> 00:07:56,521
I'll alert HQ. Call me if there's any change.

49
00:08:00,698 --> 00:08:04,566
- Lf there's any change?
- Yes, if the dead start walking.

50
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,505
I need two volunteers
to inspect the middle trench.

51
00:08:34,899 --> 00:08:36,832
You, the new guy. Go with him.

52
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,597
Him? He doesn't even know
how to load a gun.

53
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,234
Perfect. You can teach him.

54
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:47,238
Shit.

55
00:09:57,548 --> 00:09:58,708
Cera!

56
00:10:58,543 --> 00:11:02,377
You don't need this.
Nor this, nor this, nor this.

57
00:11:06,384 --> 00:11:07,908
My name's Nino.

58
00:11:14,358 --> 00:11:15,449
Here.

59
00:11:16,561 --> 00:11:19,394
If you notice anything, come straight back.

60
00:11:23,768 --> 00:11:25,235
What's wrong?

61
00:11:25,937 --> 00:11:27,529
- You scared?
- No.

62
00:11:29,707 --> 00:11:32,733
They've got the sun in their eyes,
they can't see you.

63
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:37,213
If there's trouble,
wait until dark to come back.

64
00:12:27,064 --> 00:12:28,656
Fucking hell.

65
00:13:24,288 --> 00:13:28,190
Follow me, do what I do
and don't try to be clever.

66
00:13:28,993 --> 00:13:30,324
Good luck.

67
00:16:06,717 --> 00:16:10,153
Don't touch anything.
It might be booby-trapped.

68
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,071
<i>Make a fucking effort...</i>

69
00:17:17,721 --> 00:17:19,051
Stop here.

70
00:17:30,768 --> 00:17:32,565
What are you doing?

71
00:17:32,636 --> 00:17:36,299
Seeing as we have time,
let's have a little fun.

72
00:17:37,374 --> 00:17:41,606
Look at it: "Made in EU."

73
00:17:43,047 --> 00:17:44,571
My little baby.

74
00:17:44,982 --> 00:17:46,950
What do you think it is?

75
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:50,453
- A mine.
- A bouncing mine!

76
00:17:50,688 --> 00:17:53,054
When the enemy steps on it...

77
00:17:53,457 --> 00:17:57,757
...what happens, according to you?

78
00:17:58,863 --> 00:18:01,730
- It explodes.
- No, nothing happens.

79
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:05,932
But when the enemy steps off it,
it bounces up...

80
00:18:06,971 --> 00:18:09,804
...and explodes
about three feet off the ground...

81
00:18:10,174 --> 00:18:15,077
...spraying out 2,000 lead bearings...

82
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:19,445
...that destroy everything
in a radius of 50 yards.

83
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:21,211
I'll show you.

84
00:18:22,086 --> 00:18:24,077
Move this son of a bitch.

85
00:18:47,344 --> 00:18:48,538
Gently.

86
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:54,675
Careful with the pin.

87
00:18:54,752 --> 00:18:58,448
Lay the body down slowly,
otherwise you get blown up.

88
00:19:00,057 --> 00:19:02,218
Go on, tug the wire now.

89
00:19:03,294 --> 00:19:04,693
Me? Why me?

90
00:19:05,029 --> 00:19:08,362
<i>Go on, don't worry,
as long as there's a weight...</i>

91
00:19:09,033 --> 00:19:11,024
Do it gently, that's all.

92
00:19:23,047 --> 00:19:24,412
I can't.

93
00:19:25,349 --> 00:19:26,577
Chicken!

94
00:19:35,826 --> 00:19:37,088
See that?

95
00:19:38,362 --> 00:19:40,193
I invented this.

96
00:19:41,131 --> 00:19:46,068
When they pick up the body
the mine will blow them all to hell.

97
00:19:47,338 --> 00:19:49,568
- What's your name again?
- Nino.

98
00:19:50,341 --> 00:19:52,309
You'll set the next one.

99
00:19:57,381 --> 00:19:58,848
He looks asleep.

100
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:02,647
That's because he's still fresh.
It won't last in this heat.

101
00:20:03,654 --> 00:20:07,488
Try to sleep. We'll leave once it's dark.

102
00:20:08,592 --> 00:20:11,686
Afterwards, we'll set more of these babies.

103
00:20:15,899 --> 00:20:16,991
Where's that gun?

104
00:20:19,903 --> 00:20:21,165
What gun?

105
00:21:53,263 --> 00:21:55,389
Where does this trench lead?

106
00:21:57,167 --> 00:21:58,964
Where does the trench lead?

107
00:22:10,013 --> 00:22:11,674
Where does the trench lead?

108
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:14,139
Outside.

109
00:22:14,384 --> 00:22:18,047
- Really? Where, outside?
- Into the field.

110
00:22:22,526 --> 00:22:23,925
Is it mined?

111
00:22:27,131 --> 00:22:29,224
Where does the other one lead?

112
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:32,893
- I don't know.
- You don't know anything?

113
00:22:50,587 --> 00:22:51,815
<i>Fuck...</i>

114
00:23:00,764 --> 00:23:02,857
Don't touch that! Get back!

115
00:23:09,373 --> 00:23:12,900
- How did you get here?
- We crawled.

116
00:23:13,277 --> 00:23:15,142
Across the field? You're lying!

117
00:23:15,412 --> 00:23:18,745
I'm not. Your side was blinded by the sun.

118
00:23:18,916 --> 00:23:21,611
- And the mines?
- I don't know. He knew.

119
00:23:52,883 --> 00:23:54,475
Where's the map?

120
00:23:54,551 --> 00:23:57,577
- What map?
- Of Bolivia, stupid. Of the mines!

121
00:23:58,121 --> 00:24:00,180
- Empty your pockets.
- Why?

122
00:24:00,457 --> 00:24:03,358
Because I have a gun and you don't.
Come on.

123
00:24:11,868 --> 00:24:13,266
Is that all?

124
00:24:28,385 --> 00:24:29,545
Strip.

125
00:24:31,088 --> 00:24:33,113
- What?
- Strip.

126
00:24:33,991 --> 00:24:35,083
Why?

127
00:24:35,158 --> 00:24:38,685
Are you stupid, or what?
Because I have a gun and you don't.

128
00:24:38,762 --> 00:24:41,856
You may not have noticed,
but I'm in charge here.

129
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,537
I'm starving.

130
00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:51,973
You're always starving.

131
00:25:01,852 --> 00:25:04,343
- What's up?
- You have to see this.

132
00:25:04,521 --> 00:25:05,783
What now?

133
00:25:13,063 --> 00:25:15,463
- What the hell's that?
- Is he ours?

134
00:25:16,833 --> 00:25:20,291
It's not written on his boxers.
Call the officer.

135
00:25:21,271 --> 00:25:24,434
- What do I tell him?
- That the dead are walking.

136
00:25:40,724 --> 00:25:42,486
Okay. Get down here.

137
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:49,232
You hear me? Come down.

138
00:26:31,007 --> 00:26:32,167
He wasn't ours?

139
00:26:32,776 --> 00:26:36,268
I've no idea. I only saw him for a second.

140
00:26:37,781 --> 00:26:39,442
What a hawk-eye.

141
00:26:40,917 --> 00:26:42,908
Let's not take any risks.

142
00:26:43,286 --> 00:26:45,982
Hello. Put me through to the artillery.

143
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:53,256
- I can't see anything.
- He saw him, too.

144
00:26:54,097 --> 00:26:57,624
- One of ours?
- God knows. He only had boxer shorts on.

145
00:27:16,686 --> 00:27:18,711
Any other brilliant ideas?

146
00:27:19,489 --> 00:27:22,287
If you piss me off, you go back out there.

147
00:27:31,535 --> 00:27:33,127
They've stopped.

148
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,874
Sure. Yours never stop.

149
00:27:39,242 --> 00:27:41,733
How about yours? Do they ever stop?

150
00:27:42,546 --> 00:27:45,037
You can't compare.
We didn't start the war.

151
00:27:45,215 --> 00:27:46,807
And maybe we did?

152
00:27:46,883 --> 00:27:50,751
No! The Khmer Rouge!
All you can do is make war.

153
00:27:50,987 --> 00:27:53,547
- Us?
- No, you're pacifists.

154
00:27:53,623 --> 00:27:56,057
The Great Serbia,
all the way to the Pacific!

155
00:27:56,293 --> 00:27:58,955
Please. The whole world thinks like me.

156
00:27:59,463 --> 00:28:01,363
What world? Your world!

157
00:28:01,531 --> 00:28:06,161
You show our burned villages
and say they're yours.

158
00:28:06,236 --> 00:28:08,397
And that's my side shooting now?

159
00:28:08,672 --> 00:28:12,733
You're all saints. Give it a rest.

160
00:28:12,809 --> 00:28:14,834
You don't even leave the dead in peace.

161
00:28:15,445 --> 00:28:17,003
It's not the same.

162
00:28:17,514 --> 00:28:21,882
Really? Laying mines under the dead,
pillaging, killing, raping, what's all that?

163
00:28:21,952 --> 00:28:23,817
- Who are you talking about?
- You guys!

164
00:28:23,887 --> 00:28:27,254
I haven't seen anything like what you say.

165
00:28:27,324 --> 00:28:30,816
I've seen it! I saw my village burn.

166
00:28:32,095 --> 00:28:34,689
- I don't know. I wasn't there.
- I was!

167
00:28:37,801 --> 00:28:41,429
Haven't our villages burned, too?
Who killed our people?

168
00:28:42,806 --> 00:28:45,900
Your side, probably.
They just shot at you, too.

169
00:28:46,476 --> 00:28:50,105
<i>They only shot at me
because they didn't recognize me.</i>

170
00:28:52,649 --> 00:28:54,879
It's useless talking to you.

171
00:28:55,252 --> 00:28:59,348
What the hell made you ruin
this beautiful country?

172
00:28:59,422 --> 00:29:00,650
- Us?
- Yes!

173
00:29:00,724 --> 00:29:04,251
You're crazy.
You wanted to separate, not us.

174
00:29:05,395 --> 00:29:07,886
Because you started the war!

175
00:29:07,964 --> 00:29:10,659
- You started it!
- What? Who started it?

176
00:29:10,734 --> 00:29:13,999
You started the war! You started it!

177
00:29:14,437 --> 00:29:16,199
Who started the war?

178
00:29:19,509 --> 00:29:21,704
- We did.
- You started the war.

179
00:29:22,045 --> 00:29:25,412
And stop pissing me off.
You're getting on my nerves.

180
00:29:27,017 --> 00:29:30,509
Get out! Come on, get out of here!

181
00:29:31,888 --> 00:29:33,048
Fuck.

182
00:29:34,658 --> 00:29:36,751
Daring to say it was us.

183
00:29:45,268 --> 00:29:46,929
What was all that?

184
00:29:49,105 --> 00:29:52,939
I'll alert HQ. Call me if there's any change.

185
00:30:07,591 --> 00:30:10,650
- What now?
- Nothing. We wait till dark.

186
00:30:12,429 --> 00:30:13,691
And then?

187
00:30:14,297 --> 00:30:18,063
Then, if you survive,
we'll crawl over to the lines.

188
00:30:18,702 --> 00:30:20,727
And stop bothering me.

189
00:30:21,338 --> 00:30:24,136
- So you're not going to free me.
- Dream on.

190
00:30:29,879 --> 00:30:31,641
Cera, you're alive!

191
00:30:33,183 --> 00:30:34,548
Don't move!

192
00:30:35,518 --> 00:30:36,849
Don't move!

193
00:30:37,287 --> 00:30:40,120
There's a mine under you.
It could explode.

194
00:30:41,591 --> 00:30:45,425
- What mine?
- A bounding one. Don't move.

195
00:30:47,964 --> 00:30:51,229
- Are you kidding me?
- Do I look like I'm kidding?

196
00:30:54,904 --> 00:30:56,496
Come here. Defuse it.

197
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:03,508
- You hear me? Defuse it!
- I don't know how.

198
00:31:06,182 --> 00:31:10,016
Don't fool around. Defuse it!
I'm going to kill you! Defuse it!

199
00:31:10,253 --> 00:31:12,687
If I try, I'll kill us all.

200
00:31:14,157 --> 00:31:16,852
Fuck. What is this shit?

201
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,521
Ciki, what's happening?

202
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:24,933
They laid a mine under you
to ambush our guys.

203
00:31:25,268 --> 00:31:27,566
Only they could think of that!

204
00:31:28,071 --> 00:31:29,332
Kill him.

205
00:31:33,309 --> 00:31:35,277
Kill the son of a bitch.

206
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,706
Kill him or give me the gun!

207
00:31:43,687 --> 00:31:44,710
No.

208
00:31:46,556 --> 00:31:48,319
We're not like them.

209
00:31:51,728 --> 00:31:54,288
Besides, he could be useful.
Bring the water over.

210
00:32:05,141 --> 00:32:08,941
I can't give you too much.
I don't know where you're wounded.

211
00:32:13,717 --> 00:32:15,048
Where does it hurt?

212
00:32:15,118 --> 00:32:17,848
My head and my arm.
My head's going to burst.

213
00:32:18,021 --> 00:32:21,548
That's because of the detonation.
I'm the same. Hold on.

214
00:32:23,727 --> 00:32:25,592
What about the others?

215
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,365
Don't let me die here.

216
00:32:32,602 --> 00:32:34,832
Don't worry. Does it hurt anywhere else?

217
00:32:34,904 --> 00:32:35,996
No.

218
00:32:38,341 --> 00:32:41,832
You lucky bastard.
You're unharmed. Just your arm.

219
00:32:41,911 --> 00:32:43,469
And I thought you were dead.

220
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,142
<i>Can I...</i>

221
00:32:45,548 --> 00:32:49,143
Throw the gun down.
Don't make me shoot. Throw it down!

222
00:32:51,654 --> 00:32:52,848
Get up.

223
00:32:55,024 --> 00:32:56,285
Back off.

224
00:32:57,327 --> 00:32:58,589
Back off!

225
00:32:59,129 --> 00:33:01,359
See what you've done! Get back!

226
00:33:13,376 --> 00:33:14,638
What now?

227
00:33:15,345 --> 00:33:17,210
Now, we wait for dark.

228
00:33:22,285 --> 00:33:23,718
I have to dress his wound.

229
00:33:28,758 --> 00:33:30,726
Okay, but nice and easy.

230
00:33:33,329 --> 00:33:35,126
If you fuck about...

231
00:33:35,865 --> 00:33:38,732
...l'll shoot without warning, you hear me?

232
00:33:43,339 --> 00:33:44,772
Let me see your hands!

233
00:33:54,918 --> 00:33:56,818
I told you to kill him.

234
00:33:57,921 --> 00:33:58,945
Shut up.

235
00:33:59,422 --> 00:34:02,050
What are you saying?
Throw the knife away.

236
00:34:06,262 --> 00:34:07,627
Throw the knife away!

237
00:34:11,067 --> 00:34:12,329
Back off.

238
00:34:23,379 --> 00:34:24,868
Give me those.

239
00:34:40,163 --> 00:34:41,687
Can I have one?

240
00:34:45,534 --> 00:34:46,524
Why?

241
00:34:47,937 --> 00:34:50,428
Because I have a gun and you don't.

242
00:34:51,341 --> 00:34:54,333
- Sit down.
- We have to help him.

243
00:34:54,577 --> 00:34:55,635
Sit down!

244
00:35:03,186 --> 00:35:04,915
By the way, who started the war?

245
00:35:12,195 --> 00:35:13,753
Who started the war?

246
00:35:19,469 --> 00:35:20,663
We did.

247
00:35:23,439 --> 00:35:26,533
- You started the war.
- Who cares who started it?

248
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:29,607
We're all in the same shit now.

249
00:35:30,346 --> 00:35:32,246
Can I have a cigarette?

250
00:35:39,722 --> 00:35:41,155
What are you doing?

251
00:35:41,224 --> 00:35:42,885
- Don't move.
- Hold on!

252
00:35:42,959 --> 00:35:44,551
- Put the gun down.
- Calm down!

253
00:35:44,694 --> 00:35:47,356
- Put it down!
- Lf I do, he'll kill me!

254
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:51,196
- Lf you don't, we're fucked.
- No!

255
00:35:51,267 --> 00:35:52,962
I won't kill you, I promise.

256
00:35:53,036 --> 00:35:55,061
- No.
- Put the gun down.

257
00:35:55,838 --> 00:35:58,830
Calm down. Gently. Wait!

258
00:35:59,442 --> 00:36:00,602
<i>Okay...</i>

259
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:03,340
Okay, he takes the gun, but I keep mine.

260
00:36:03,746 --> 00:36:06,306
Ciki, take the gun.

261
00:36:07,784 --> 00:36:09,046
Slowly.

262
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:11,347
Okay.

263
00:36:13,589 --> 00:36:15,078
Put it on your shoulder.

264
00:36:16,793 --> 00:36:18,761
Put it on your shoulder!

265
00:36:22,832 --> 00:36:23,924
Okay.

266
00:36:25,468 --> 00:36:26,832
Don't move.

267
00:36:40,516 --> 00:36:42,416
Put yours on your shoulder, too!

268
00:36:56,032 --> 00:36:57,932
There, we're equal now.

269
00:37:29,799 --> 00:37:31,562
Here, for your head.

270
00:37:48,284 --> 00:37:50,149
Cut it out. Calm down.

271
00:37:52,355 --> 00:37:54,220
I'm fucking sick of this.

272
00:38:03,166 --> 00:38:04,428
What now?

273
00:38:05,968 --> 00:38:07,491
I have an idea.

274
00:38:08,171 --> 00:38:10,662
So do I. First, give me the cigarettes.

275
00:38:12,842 --> 00:38:14,503
What is it?

276
00:38:15,311 --> 00:38:17,211
- What's wrong?
- Fuck!

277
00:38:18,314 --> 00:38:20,178
What a mess in Rwanda.

278
00:38:21,684 --> 00:38:23,413
You're really nuts.

279
00:38:30,093 --> 00:38:31,720
I don't believe it.

280
00:38:32,395 --> 00:38:35,023
- What is it?
- There's two of them now.

281
00:38:35,731 --> 00:38:38,598
- What are they yelling about?
- Call the officer.

282
00:38:51,781 --> 00:38:53,248
Unbelievable.

283
00:38:54,016 --> 00:38:56,246
It's this morning's greenhorn.

284
00:38:57,587 --> 00:38:59,680
Call the UNPROFOR for me.

285
00:39:02,658 --> 00:39:04,853
I've never seen anything like it.

286
00:39:05,128 --> 00:39:07,358
We ought to call the UNPROFOR.

287
00:39:08,931 --> 00:39:10,421
I'll alert HQ.

288
00:39:19,075 --> 00:39:21,509
I hope those aren't my cigarettes.

289
00:39:22,478 --> 00:39:25,641
When I took them,
I didn't think you'd need them.

290
00:39:27,083 --> 00:39:28,710
But now I hope...

291
00:39:33,489 --> 00:39:35,684
...that you'll die of cancer.

292
00:39:51,941 --> 00:39:53,033
Okay?

293
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:55,799
You know what?

294
00:39:56,712 --> 00:39:59,044
Maybe you shouldn't smoke today.

295
00:40:01,083 --> 00:40:02,675
Everything okay?

296
00:40:04,287 --> 00:40:07,312
You haven't told me your name.
My name's Nino.

297
00:40:10,693 --> 00:40:14,595
What's your problem?
You want what? An introduction?

298
00:40:15,231 --> 00:40:18,428
To exchange phone numbers
and visiting cards?

299
00:40:19,168 --> 00:40:21,432
We don't need an introduction.

300
00:40:21,737 --> 00:40:25,468
Next time we see each other,
it'll be through a gun's sight.

301
00:40:33,749 --> 00:40:35,216
What's wrong with him?

302
00:40:37,753 --> 00:40:39,482
Keep an eye on him.

303
00:41:01,244 --> 00:41:02,711
It's for you.

304
00:41:09,552 --> 00:41:11,076
Call Arizona 2.

305
00:41:11,887 --> 00:41:15,254
<i>Charlie Tango to Arizona 2, over.
Do you copy? Over.</i>

306
00:41:19,228 --> 00:41:21,423
Arizona 2. I copy. Over.

307
00:41:22,465 --> 00:41:26,196
<i>I have your report.
Are they civilians or military?</i>

308
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:31,670
We do not have that information.
Request permission to check.

309
00:41:33,609 --> 00:41:38,342
<i>Negative/ We must be sure
of the Sira-Bravo cease-fire, okay?</i>

310
00:41:39,915 --> 00:41:41,576
Affirmative. Over.

311
00:41:42,585 --> 00:41:45,247
<i>Do you know how many
need to be evacuated?</i>

312
00:41:46,255 --> 00:41:47,779
Negative. Over.

313
00:41:50,192 --> 00:41:54,288
<i>Arizona 2, stay where you are.
I'll talk to my superiors.</i>

314
00:41:55,665 --> 00:41:57,792
Message received. Over and out.

315
00:41:59,802 --> 00:42:02,669
- Why the fuck are we here?
- Good question.

316
00:42:02,738 --> 00:42:06,799
I reckon it's simple:
To stop the locals killing each other.

317
00:42:07,043 --> 00:42:10,774
Except we can't use force
or get into dangerous situations.

318
00:42:11,614 --> 00:42:13,639
I'm sick of just watching.

319
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:16,542
Right, let's go.

320
00:42:16,786 --> 00:42:20,017
- Georges, stay here.
- We can't leave like this.

321
00:42:20,089 --> 00:42:23,183
Stay if you want
and figure out why you're here.

322
00:42:54,457 --> 00:42:56,891
Don't fall asleep, you might move.

323
00:42:57,927 --> 00:43:00,020
How can I fall asleep...

324
00:43:02,164 --> 00:43:04,325
...with this shit under me?

325
00:43:05,201 --> 00:43:07,635
Fuck, why is this happening to me?

326
00:43:10,139 --> 00:43:13,836
We'll find a solution.
Try to think of something else.

327
00:43:15,311 --> 00:43:16,278
<i>Ciki...</i>

328
00:43:18,414 --> 00:43:19,779
Don't let me die here.

329
00:43:22,785 --> 00:43:25,219
Listen, I'm staying here with you.

330
00:43:26,655 --> 00:43:28,714
If you die, I die too.

331
00:43:29,558 --> 00:43:31,082
What a comfort!

332
00:43:31,694 --> 00:43:33,025
Come on.

333
00:43:35,097 --> 00:43:37,224
I'll check what's happening.

334
00:44:17,373 --> 00:44:20,035
SERBIAN BARRICADE

335
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:28,810
Hello.

336
00:44:29,618 --> 00:44:32,678
- Do you speak French?
- French? No.

337
00:44:32,888 --> 00:44:34,321
- English?
- Yes.

338
00:44:35,825 --> 00:44:39,556
- We came for people.
- Yes.

339
00:44:40,095 --> 00:44:41,790
- People, you know?
- Yes.

340
00:44:42,264 --> 00:44:43,754
People between lines.

341
00:44:46,402 --> 00:44:48,233
- Where are they?
- Yes.

342
00:44:49,505 --> 00:44:52,736
Okay, you understand nothing
of what I've said.

343
00:44:52,808 --> 00:44:53,797
Yes.

344
00:44:58,447 --> 00:45:00,278
You speak English?

345
00:45:01,617 --> 00:45:02,606
No.

346
00:45:02,685 --> 00:45:03,879
French?

347
00:45:06,689 --> 00:45:09,589
We are here for people between lines.

348
00:45:12,027 --> 00:45:15,793
- What's he saying?
- God knows, just say yes, yes.

349
00:45:18,734 --> 00:45:21,066
Does anyone here know languages?

350
00:45:29,378 --> 00:45:31,869
We are here, this place.

351
00:45:35,851 --> 00:45:37,546
Where are the men?

352
00:45:40,923 --> 00:45:42,685
Here? Here people?

353
00:45:43,425 --> 00:45:44,722
Soldiers?

354
00:45:46,328 --> 00:45:49,058
- Any mine?
- No mine.

355
00:45:49,431 --> 00:45:51,296
- You sure?
- No mine.

356
00:45:53,936 --> 00:45:55,563
We go now.

357
00:45:56,071 --> 00:45:58,335
Okay? We go, you don't shoot.

358
00:45:59,275 --> 00:46:01,368
Shoot, no. Nobody shoots.

359
00:46:02,011 --> 00:46:03,911
- Yeah.
- Okay, thank you.

360
00:46:09,084 --> 00:46:10,676
Tell HQ the UNPROFOR is here.

361
00:46:10,753 --> 00:46:13,688
I don't want anybody shooting.
Is that clear?

362
00:46:18,827 --> 00:46:21,557
- Sorry about earlier.
- You were right.

363
00:46:23,098 --> 00:46:26,534
Why get acquainted
to watch each other through sights?

364
00:46:28,003 --> 00:46:31,666
- In any case, thanks for the idea.
- Let's hope it works.

365
00:46:34,243 --> 00:46:36,871
What's going on? Think they understood?

366
00:46:40,516 --> 00:46:43,781
- How is he?
- How do you expect him to be?

367
00:46:44,687 --> 00:46:47,520
- Have you known him long?
- Since the war.

368
00:46:49,224 --> 00:46:51,954
Since the beginning of this fucking war.

369
00:46:52,094 --> 00:46:54,392
What about you and the old man?

370
00:46:55,698 --> 00:46:57,790
I don't even know his name.

371
00:46:59,668 --> 00:47:01,226
You're from Banja Luka.

372
00:47:01,303 --> 00:47:04,100
How do you know? Yeah, right.

373
00:47:06,742 --> 00:47:10,109
I had a chick in Banja Luka. Sanja.

374
00:47:11,647 --> 00:47:13,114
I knew a Sanja, too.

375
00:47:13,582 --> 00:47:15,812
<i>- She had...
- This one, too.</i>

376
00:47:18,153 --> 00:47:19,346
- Blonde.
- Yes.

377
00:47:19,421 --> 00:47:20,444
- Tall.
- Yes.

378
00:47:20,789 --> 00:47:22,256
With a beauty spot.

379
00:47:22,725 --> 00:47:24,716
- Sanja Cengic!
- I was at school with her.

380
00:47:24,793 --> 00:47:26,522
- No kidding?
- I swear.

381
00:47:28,564 --> 00:47:29,962
- Cera!
- Yeah.

382
00:47:30,065 --> 00:47:32,556
He knows the Sanja I mentioned!

383
00:47:33,235 --> 00:47:34,725
Brilliant.

384
00:47:37,339 --> 00:47:39,136
What's become of her?

385
00:47:40,909 --> 00:47:42,570
She's gone abroad.

386
00:47:45,714 --> 00:47:47,375
I don't blame her.

387
00:47:52,221 --> 00:47:54,781
BOSNIAN BARRICADE

388
00:48:01,263 --> 00:48:04,288
- Hello. Do you speak French?
- No, English.

389
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:09,727
<i>- Okay, we are here for people...
- Yes, we called. You can go.</i>

390
00:48:09,805 --> 00:48:11,796
- It's okay? We go?
- Go.

391
00:48:12,474 --> 00:48:15,534
- Any mines there?
- We didn't put any.

392
00:48:17,746 --> 00:48:19,373
Okay. Go ahead.

393
00:48:33,262 --> 00:48:36,254
<i>- Sarajevo on line.
- Hello, Col. Soft speaking.</i>

394
00:48:36,465 --> 00:48:40,094
<i>- Hello, sir. This is Capt. Dubois.
- How can I help you?</i>

395
00:48:40,502 --> 00:48:44,302
<i>It's the first time that the two camps
are asking me for the same thing...</i>

396
00:48:44,373 --> 00:48:46,466
<i>... and I don't know what to do.</i>

397
00:48:46,542 --> 00:48:49,875
Why are you asking me
and not your superiors?

398
00:48:49,945 --> 00:48:53,403
<i>They are all in Geneva
for a seminar on media relations.</i>

399
00:48:54,349 --> 00:48:57,716
It seems from your report that these men...

400
00:48:57,786 --> 00:49:00,812
...are stranded between the two front lines.

401
00:49:00,889 --> 00:49:04,325
But we don't even know
if they are soldiers or not. Is that right?

402
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:06,652
What do you expect me to do?

403
00:49:06,729 --> 00:49:10,392
I can't risk the lives of our soldiers
in order to save theirs.

404
00:49:10,466 --> 00:49:14,663
Do I have to remind you of the precise
purpose of our mission here in Bosnia?

405
00:49:14,737 --> 00:49:17,433
<i>Since it is the first time
that the two camps are...</i>

406
00:49:17,506 --> 00:49:20,703
You know perfectly well
that there is nothing that I can do...

407
00:49:20,776 --> 00:49:24,234
...without the approval of the General
Assembly of the United Nations.

408
00:49:24,313 --> 00:49:27,180
I don't think the General Assembly
will convene itself...

409
00:49:27,249 --> 00:49:31,651
...specifically to deal with the problems
of two unknown individuals...

410
00:49:32,855 --> 00:49:34,550
...trapped in no man's land.

411
00:49:34,623 --> 00:49:37,558
There is nothing I can do.
I don't have the authority.

412
00:49:37,626 --> 00:49:39,389
<i>What should I tell them, sir?</i>

413
00:49:39,461 --> 00:49:42,258
Tell them that, as usual,
neither side can agree.

414
00:49:42,331 --> 00:49:44,561
Tell them anything you like. Good-bye.

415
00:50:14,663 --> 00:50:16,255
Is someone coming?

416
00:50:16,732 --> 00:50:19,257
Probably. See, they've stopped shooting.

417
00:50:19,635 --> 00:50:20,727
Fuck.

418
00:50:22,604 --> 00:50:25,573
I don't even know
what this shithole's called.

419
00:50:26,041 --> 00:50:29,568
- I'd hate to die here.
- Stop being a pain in the ass.

420
00:50:29,912 --> 00:50:33,439
They'll get a mine expert
and it'll soon be over.

421
00:50:37,753 --> 00:50:40,153
I told you, we'll leave together.

422
00:50:53,335 --> 00:50:56,031
Here come the Smurfs! Cera!
The Smurfs!

423
00:51:06,782 --> 00:51:09,410
If they radio us, call me immediately.

424
00:51:09,651 --> 00:51:12,051
What if something happens to you?

425
00:51:16,725 --> 00:51:18,192
- Hello.
- Hello.

426
00:51:18,894 --> 00:51:20,884
- Do you speak French?
- No.

427
00:51:21,997 --> 00:51:23,555
- English?
- A little.

428
00:51:23,832 --> 00:51:26,323
One's a Serb and one's Bosnian.

429
00:51:27,035 --> 00:51:28,524
How did they get here?

430
00:51:28,604 --> 00:51:32,734
- Do we take the dead guys' guns?
- No, it's okay.

431
00:51:32,808 --> 00:51:35,368
- You're okay?
- Yes, okay.

432
00:51:37,145 --> 00:51:40,308
We come to help you. My name is Neil.

433
00:51:41,717 --> 00:51:42,911
He needs help.

434
00:51:43,218 --> 00:51:45,345
- Is he wounded?
- Yes.

435
00:51:48,724 --> 00:51:51,921
We must not move him. Mines.

436
00:51:53,395 --> 00:51:56,262
We move him, mine explode.

437
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:01,968
- He's on a mine that could blow.
- Thanks for the translation.

438
00:52:03,605 --> 00:52:05,732
What the fuck happened here?

439
00:52:07,776 --> 00:52:11,973
<i>- Okay, don't worry.
- Yes, but...</i>

440
00:52:13,482 --> 00:52:14,881
Stop!

441
00:52:22,758 --> 00:52:23,952
Oh, shit.

442
00:52:25,394 --> 00:52:28,386
A bouncing mine. These guys are crazy.

443
00:52:28,463 --> 00:52:31,091
What a fuck-up. We need the mine squad.

444
00:52:31,767 --> 00:52:33,734
Sarge! Charlie Tango calling.

445
00:52:33,835 --> 00:52:36,099
Okay, I'll come back in two minutes.

446
00:52:36,171 --> 00:52:38,571
Michel, give them water and food.

447
00:52:41,543 --> 00:52:43,135
What did he say?

448
00:52:49,318 --> 00:52:53,015
Arizona 2 to Charlie Tango, come in.

449
00:52:54,656 --> 00:52:58,683
<i>Arizona 2, we have orders not to move.
Things are too risky.</i>

450
00:52:59,761 --> 00:53:03,197
We're already on the spot.
Everything's under control.

451
00:53:03,432 --> 00:53:06,127
Both sides are respecting the cease-fire.

452
00:53:06,601 --> 00:53:09,593
We have three evacuees
and need a mine expert.

453
00:53:10,539 --> 00:53:12,063
<i>Who's speaking?</i>

454
00:53:13,775 --> 00:53:15,436
Sgt. Marchand.

455
00:53:15,811 --> 00:53:18,371
<i>You have 5 minutes to pull out...</i>

456
00:53:18,647 --> 00:53:21,138
<i>... and 15 to call me from the checkpoint.</i>

457
00:53:21,216 --> 00:53:24,208
<i>And report to the duty officer
on your return/</i>

458
00:53:25,354 --> 00:53:29,450
Sir, could you send a mine squad?
We have an emergency here.

459
00:53:29,725 --> 00:53:31,920
<i>The only emergency is to pull out.</i>

460
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:36,492
<i>I repeat, for the last time,
I want you out in 5 minutes...</i>

461
00:53:36,698 --> 00:53:39,258
<i>... and call me in 15 to confirm...</i>

462
00:53:39,334 --> 00:53:42,269
<i>... that you're back
and that your men are safe.</i>

463
00:53:42,738 --> 00:53:46,230
<i>Or I'll have you arrested.
I'll be expecting your call.</i>

464
00:53:47,843 --> 00:53:49,002
Idiot!

465
00:53:52,214 --> 00:53:53,613
Get back in.

466
00:53:54,516 --> 00:53:55,778
What for?

467
00:53:56,752 --> 00:53:57,810
We must leave.

468
00:53:57,886 --> 00:53:59,410
- What?
- They're leaving.

469
00:53:59,621 --> 00:54:02,920
- You'll come back?
- I don't know, my boss said we must leave.

470
00:54:03,859 --> 00:54:05,986
I'm sorry. I'll try to come back.

471
00:54:07,996 --> 00:54:10,556
Thank God we can count on you.

472
00:54:11,366 --> 00:54:13,163
If you want, I take you with me.

473
00:54:13,235 --> 00:54:15,499
- What?
- We can go with him.

474
00:54:16,138 --> 00:54:19,471
Really? Thank him nicely
and tell him he can fuck off!

475
00:54:19,708 --> 00:54:21,733
- Ciki, go.
- Shut up.

476
00:54:22,344 --> 00:54:23,834
Go and bring back help.

477
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:29,378
Wait!

478
00:54:29,551 --> 00:54:31,018
I'll come with you.

479
00:54:31,887 --> 00:54:33,514
- Where are you going?
- With them.

480
00:54:33,588 --> 00:54:35,954
- You're going nowhere!
- Why?

481
00:54:36,525 --> 00:54:40,461
This is all your fault.
If you stay, your side won't shoot.

482
00:54:40,796 --> 00:54:43,788
- They won't shoot, I swear.
- You're staying here.

483
00:54:44,399 --> 00:54:46,866
You're going to shoot me? Go ahead!

484
00:54:46,935 --> 00:54:48,698
Stop fooling around!

485
00:54:49,571 --> 00:54:50,731
No!

486
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:53,567
Stop, guys!

487
00:54:54,643 --> 00:54:56,611
Okay! Cool! Stop!

488
00:54:57,079 --> 00:54:58,546
Lower your weapons!

489
00:54:59,114 --> 00:55:00,638
Michel, get in!

490
00:55:09,958 --> 00:55:11,050
What happened?

491
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:13,360
- What a fuck-up.
- They're maniacs!

492
00:55:13,428 --> 00:55:14,190
Shut it!

493
00:55:14,996 --> 00:55:17,863
- I knew this would be shitty.
- Shut it!

494
00:55:23,939 --> 00:55:26,931
- You're crazy, you maniac!
- I warned you.

495
00:55:28,577 --> 00:55:32,536
I'll kill you for this! I swear!

496
00:55:33,281 --> 00:55:35,476
I've fucking had it with you.

497
00:55:44,226 --> 00:55:47,195
Keep cool just a while longer. Screw them.

498
00:55:47,429 --> 00:55:50,227
It'll be dark soon
and I'll think of something.

499
00:55:57,506 --> 00:55:59,098
How does this shit work?

500
00:56:01,409 --> 00:56:03,604
I'm sick of asking you!

501
00:56:04,146 --> 00:56:05,511
Fuck knows!

502
00:56:06,615 --> 00:56:09,412
It explodes
when you take the weight away.

503
00:56:13,622 --> 00:56:16,647
Here we are at a Bosnian barricade
near the town of Tuzla...

504
00:56:16,892 --> 00:56:18,859
...talking to the Bosnian Commander.

505
00:56:18,927 --> 00:56:21,725
How do you feel about the talks in Geneva?

506
00:56:22,097 --> 00:56:24,930
I'd like to go there.
Would you go with me?

507
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:28,701
Are you resentful that people are talking
while you are suffering?

508
00:56:29,971 --> 00:56:31,438
What happened?

509
00:56:34,176 --> 00:56:37,441
It's very confused.
We go now and bring some help.

510
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:41,272
- Why don't you tell them the truth?
- Who are you?

511
00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:44,684
I am Jane Livingston,
Global News Channel...

512
00:56:44,853 --> 00:56:49,790
...and this is Sgt. Marchand,
otherwise known as Arizona 2.

513
00:56:50,892 --> 00:56:52,484
Stop the engine.

514
00:56:53,728 --> 00:56:57,095
- How do you know that?
- We were listening to your radio frequency.

515
00:56:57,332 --> 00:57:00,426
Since we were in the area,
we thought we'd come and verify.

516
00:57:00,635 --> 00:57:02,967
- You listened to our radio?
- Absolutely.

517
00:57:03,305 --> 00:57:05,466
It's the best way to get fresh information.

518
00:57:05,674 --> 00:57:09,701
Are you going back?
Why do you need a bomb disposal unit?

519
00:57:10,245 --> 00:57:11,439
Stop the camera.

520
00:57:11,913 --> 00:57:14,575
- Can you take us there?
- No, I have to go.

521
00:57:15,217 --> 00:57:16,377
That's right.

522
00:57:16,952 --> 00:57:21,946
You're just here to distribute
humanitarian aid.

523
00:57:22,557 --> 00:57:25,491
Okay, we'll go without you.
Come on, let's go.

524
00:57:25,994 --> 00:57:28,462
You can't. It's too dangerous.

525
00:57:30,198 --> 00:57:31,392
Is that an order?

526
00:57:34,703 --> 00:57:37,194
Okay, stop filming, please.

527
00:57:43,545 --> 00:57:44,739
Please?

528
00:57:45,647 --> 00:57:47,171
Yes, all right.

529
00:57:55,123 --> 00:57:57,819
Maybe I can help you if you'll help me.

530
00:57:58,627 --> 00:58:00,924
We have an English TV crew here.

531
00:58:01,129 --> 00:58:03,154
They know everything.

532
00:58:03,665 --> 00:58:07,328
Other crews are on the way.
They picked up our frequency.

533
00:58:07,836 --> 00:58:10,167
I didn't answer their questions.

534
00:58:11,473 --> 00:58:14,499
Hello, Captain.
This is Jane Livingston of Global News.

535
00:58:14,576 --> 00:58:16,567
I can hear everything you're saying.

536
00:58:16,645 --> 00:58:20,206
Are we to assume that the UNPROFOR
are doing absolutely nothing...

537
00:58:20,282 --> 00:58:23,615
...for those who are wounded
and trapped between the two fronts?

538
00:58:23,685 --> 00:58:27,678
Who made this decision?
Are headquarters aware of the situation?

539
00:58:28,890 --> 00:58:33,656
<i>You know very well that you have no right
to listen or to use this frequency.</i>

540
00:58:33,895 --> 00:58:37,296
<i>Get off it immediately
or we'll confiscate your press card. Over.</i>

541
00:58:38,833 --> 00:58:40,460
Is that a threat?

542
00:58:41,069 --> 00:58:44,903
<i>Listen, Miss Livingston,
I was not in any way threatening you.</i>

543
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:48,303
<i>Please, try to understand.
We are doing what we can.</i>

544
00:58:48,677 --> 00:58:53,376
<i>At this moment we are in negotiations
with both camps to arrange a ceasefire.</i>

545
00:58:53,682 --> 00:58:57,413
<i>As you know, the situation
is extremely complicated and takes time.</i>

546
00:58:58,019 --> 00:58:59,008
That's a lie.

547
00:58:59,387 --> 00:59:02,652
Can you tell me where these negotiations
are and who's in charge?

548
00:59:02,724 --> 00:59:06,125
I have my second unit on hand here
who could cover it immediately.

549
00:59:06,494 --> 00:59:08,792
<i>I have no more information
for the moment.</i>

550
00:59:09,497 --> 00:59:12,158
You're telling me
that negotiations are taking place...

551
00:59:12,233 --> 00:59:15,031
...but you don't know where they are
or who's in charge.

552
00:59:15,270 --> 00:59:16,862
At the same time...

553
00:59:16,938 --> 00:59:21,307
...you've requested that your soldiers
who were on the scene return to base.

554
00:59:21,910 --> 00:59:23,877
<i>I just carry out orders.</i>

555
00:59:24,913 --> 00:59:27,438
Who issues these orders?
Can I have a name?

556
00:59:27,816 --> 00:59:30,307
<i>I cannot disclose military affairs.</i>

557
00:59:30,752 --> 00:59:34,017
<i>First of all, I must request authorization
from my superiors.</i>

558
00:59:35,857 --> 00:59:38,553
Fine, go ahead.
I'll wait right here for your answer.

559
00:59:38,626 --> 00:59:41,686
I'm preparing a news report
which goes off in half an hour...

560
00:59:41,763 --> 00:59:44,493
...and it will be fascinating
to monitor the response...

561
00:59:44,566 --> 00:59:47,330
...of millions of our viewers
who will watch the show.

562
00:59:47,569 --> 00:59:48,968
Thank you, Captain.

563
00:59:49,137 --> 00:59:51,264
<i>Arizona 2, are you still there?</i>

564
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:53,999
Affirmative, Charlie Tango.

565
00:59:54,275 --> 00:59:56,766
<i>Stay there until further orders.
Over and out.</i>

566
00:59:58,380 --> 01:00:00,245
Message received, sir.

567
01:00:01,349 --> 01:00:03,579
- Could l...
- No, please, not now.

568
01:00:10,125 --> 01:00:12,025
Why are you doing this?

569
01:00:13,061 --> 01:00:15,291
I'm sick of being a bystander.

570
01:00:15,730 --> 01:00:18,164
- What would you do?
- What I'd do?

571
01:00:19,167 --> 01:00:23,125
I'd stop the madmen ruining this country.
We have what it takes.

572
01:00:23,938 --> 01:00:25,667
Aren't you neutral?

573
01:00:27,409 --> 01:00:29,900
You can't be neutral facing murder.

574
01:00:30,445 --> 01:00:32,640
Doing nothing to stop it is taking sides.

575
01:00:32,714 --> 01:00:35,444
Magnificent. Will you say that on camera?

576
01:00:36,251 --> 01:00:38,082
I may be mad, but I'm not stupid.

577
01:00:38,153 --> 01:00:40,144
- Jane.
- Yeah, I'm coming.

578
01:00:40,688 --> 01:00:42,417
I'll be right back.

579
01:01:00,341 --> 01:01:02,400
- What's wrong?
- My leg's itching.

580
01:01:02,477 --> 01:01:03,671
Wait.

581
01:01:04,879 --> 01:01:07,712
You want to blow us away?
I'll scratch you.

582
01:01:08,450 --> 01:01:09,973
Lower.

583
01:01:10,452 --> 01:01:13,114
Again. To the left.

584
01:01:14,122 --> 01:01:15,919
There. That's good.

585
01:01:22,864 --> 01:01:24,525
I need the toilet.

586
01:01:30,271 --> 01:01:32,000
Piss in your pants.

587
01:01:32,974 --> 01:01:34,498
It's the other.

588
01:01:39,647 --> 01:01:40,978
It's okay.

589
01:01:44,152 --> 01:01:45,915
Easy for you to say.

590
01:01:46,321 --> 01:01:48,152
Here at the Bosnian barricade...

591
01:01:48,389 --> 01:01:51,358
...we do not know if this is yet another
mission impossible...

592
01:01:51,693 --> 01:01:54,958
...or if, indeed, they will actually decide
to do something.

593
01:01:55,497 --> 01:01:56,759
<i>Thank you, Jane.</i>

594
01:01:56,831 --> 01:02:00,528
<i>Let's take a look at the history
of UN involvement in the Bosnian conflict.</i>

595
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:08,201
Martha, get me Capt. Dubois, please.

596
01:02:08,276 --> 01:02:11,245
<i>He just called,
but I told him that you were out.</i>

597
01:02:11,513 --> 01:02:13,606
Call him back and tell him I'm here.

598
01:02:14,282 --> 01:02:17,740
<i>You're pushing Bosnia-Herzegovina...</i>

599
01:02:18,319 --> 01:02:22,221
<i>... to follow the same path
of horror and suffering...</i>

600
01:02:22,290 --> 01:02:24,383
<i>... as Slovenia and Croatia.</i>

601
01:02:24,893 --> 01:02:29,091
<i>You'll lead Bosnia into hell
and this may end up...</i>

602
01:02:29,163 --> 01:02:31,028
<i>... exterminating the Muslim people/</i>

603
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:35,365
<i>Radovan Karadzic didn't wait long
to carry out his threat.</i>

604
01:02:35,537 --> 01:02:39,997
<i>Bosnian Serb paramilitary forces,
largely helped by the Yugoslav army...</i>

605
01:02:40,074 --> 01:02:42,133
<i>... furiously attacked Bosnian cities...</i>

606
01:02:42,210 --> 01:02:45,236
<i>... that were defended only
by armed Bosnian civilians...</i>

607
01:02:45,313 --> 01:02:48,749
<i>... and the rest of the police forces
loyal to the Bosnian government.</i>

608
01:02:48,816 --> 01:02:51,910
<i>Serbs started massive attacks
against civilian targets...</i>

609
01:02:52,153 --> 01:02:56,647
<i>... spreading fear and terror and introducing
a new term: Ethnical cleansing.</i>

610
01:02:57,258 --> 01:02:59,886
<i>The world community
finally decided to do something...</i>

611
01:02:59,961 --> 01:03:04,022
<i>... after Serb artillery massacred people
waiting in lines for bread.</i>

612
01:03:04,198 --> 01:03:07,133
<i>UN Security Council
decided to send to Bosnia...</i>

613
01:03:07,201 --> 01:03:10,500
<i>... 9,000 troops supported by
the American 6th Fleet.</i>

614
01:03:11,506 --> 01:03:14,873
<i>At the moment when the whole world
expected military intervention...</i>

615
01:03:14,943 --> 01:03:18,435
<i>... French President François Mitterrand
lands in Sarajevo...</i>

616
01:03:18,746 --> 01:03:20,976
<i>... a city that was already under siege.</i>

617
01:03:21,115 --> 01:03:24,915
<i>Bosnians received him as a savior,
but he had different plans.</i>

618
01:03:25,386 --> 01:03:29,345
<i>After meeting with Radovan Karadzic,
he opened Sarajevo airport...</i>

619
01:03:29,557 --> 01:03:32,821
<i>... and started wide-scale
humanitarian aid action.</i>

620
01:03:34,095 --> 01:03:39,089
<i>UN troops were assigned to protect
and follow the UNHCR food convoys...</i>

621
01:03:39,534 --> 01:03:42,162
<i>... without any right to interfere
in the conflict.</i>

622
01:03:42,236 --> 01:03:45,433
<i>Today, Bosnians are still denied
the right to defend themselves...</i>

623
01:03:45,506 --> 01:03:47,736
<i>... by an imposed UN weapon embargo...</i>

624
01:03:47,976 --> 01:03:52,675
<i>... although, at this very moment, war
continues without any signs of pacification.</i>

625
01:03:53,481 --> 01:03:55,881
<i>The tragedy
of the Bosnian nation continues...</i>

626
01:03:56,184 --> 01:04:01,178
<i>... and the only help they've got now
is 120 grams of humanitarian aid per day.</i>

627
01:04:03,057 --> 01:04:05,524
<i>For those joining us now,
we have news from Bosnia...</i>

628
01:04:05,593 --> 01:04:07,618
<i>... where some men
are caught in no man's land.</i>

629
01:04:07,695 --> 01:04:09,629
<i>Our correspondent
Jane Livingston is there.</i>

630
01:04:09,697 --> 01:04:12,723
<i>We're waiting to see which measure
will be taken by UNPROFOR.</i>

631
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:15,030
<i>Is there anything you'd like to add, Jane?</i>

632
01:04:15,203 --> 01:04:19,503
<i>Olivia, I would like to repeat the words
that I heard here only moments ago.</i>

633
01:04:20,441 --> 01:04:23,604
<i>"Neutrality does not exist
in the face of murder.</i>

634
01:04:23,811 --> 01:04:27,008
<i>"Doing nothing to stop it is,
in fact, choosing.</i>

635
01:04:27,315 --> 01:04:29,476
<i>"It is not being neutral."</i>

636
01:04:31,185 --> 01:04:33,380
<i>Thank you, Jane.
We'll come back to you later.</i>

637
01:04:33,454 --> 01:04:37,151
<i>That was Jane Livingston, live from Bosnia.
We'll be back after this.</i>

638
01:04:43,531 --> 01:04:47,729
Martha, gonna need a helicopter
and a map of Bosnia-Herzegovina.

639
01:04:48,136 --> 01:04:52,232
How was it? We haven't had an
opportunity like that in a very long time.

640
01:04:53,341 --> 01:04:54,433
Yeah.

641
01:04:55,176 --> 01:04:58,339
I know. I just hope it will make them
move their asses, you know?

642
01:04:59,313 --> 01:05:01,281
Yeah. That's right.

643
01:05:01,683 --> 01:05:04,174
Okay. I'll call you as soon as we get there.

644
01:05:04,252 --> 01:05:08,245
Shit! We weren't the only ones listening
to the UNPROFOR, obviously.

645
01:05:09,624 --> 01:05:11,113
Hi, John.

646
01:05:13,327 --> 01:05:15,727
Okay, guys. We have the go-ahead.

647
01:05:17,832 --> 01:05:20,129
Stay here while we check things.

648
01:05:20,201 --> 01:05:22,101
Come on. That's not what we agreed.

649
01:05:22,437 --> 01:05:26,237
It's too dangerous now.
You can move in with the mine expert.

650
01:05:26,741 --> 01:05:29,710
<i>No! You said that you would take us up...</i>

651
01:05:31,679 --> 01:05:33,078
Fucking French.

652
01:05:34,682 --> 01:05:36,046
Really, I'm sick of it.

653
01:06:50,958 --> 01:06:53,256
Give me the photo in my pocket.

654
01:06:54,529 --> 01:06:56,724
- Which pocket?
- The top one.

655
01:06:57,965 --> 01:06:58,954
This one.

656
01:07:04,539 --> 01:07:05,904
Let me see.

657
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:11,173
- Why do soldiers always carry photos?
- I've no idea. Let me see.

658
01:07:13,514 --> 01:07:15,379
I can't see like that.

659
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:29,587
- Think I'll see her again?
- Cut it out, of course you will.

660
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:33,626
Ciki!

661
01:07:38,439 --> 01:07:40,498
Stop it, for God's sake!

662
01:07:40,608 --> 01:07:41,700
Shit!

663
01:07:46,747 --> 01:07:48,078
You stop!

664
01:07:48,282 --> 01:07:49,874
Watch the knife!

665
01:07:50,651 --> 01:07:51,948
Stop now!

666
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:55,912
It's over! You stop! Help is coming.

667
01:07:57,225 --> 01:08:00,661
The mining squad is coming.
You understand? You tell him.

668
01:08:01,863 --> 01:08:03,830
The mine squad's coming!

669
01:08:04,131 --> 01:08:05,598
I'll kill you for this!

670
01:08:11,772 --> 01:08:13,467
It's good for you.

671
01:08:14,876 --> 01:08:16,241
Help coming.

672
01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:21,944
I'll get reinforcements.
Keep an eye on them...

673
01:08:22,250 --> 01:08:24,184
...and clean his wound.

674
01:08:31,058 --> 01:08:34,118
Take this. Call me if there's a problem.

675
01:08:52,947 --> 01:08:56,348
- What's happening?
- Okay, you'll be able to film.

676
01:08:56,417 --> 01:08:57,441
Are you sure?

677
01:08:57,518 --> 01:09:00,009
Everything okay? Are you all right?

678
01:09:10,665 --> 01:09:12,394
- Sgt. Marchand.
- Capt. Dubois.

679
01:09:12,566 --> 01:09:15,796
- Captain, can you tell us what's going on?
- Just one moment, please.

680
01:09:16,103 --> 01:09:19,595
- Can we have an interview later?
- I told you, one minute.

681
01:09:20,174 --> 01:09:22,870
- What's going on?
- A hell of a mess, sir.

682
01:09:23,344 --> 01:09:25,778
It's really tense. We just had to intervene.

683
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:29,316
We're taking no risks.
Any trouble, we pull out, okay?

684
01:09:30,651 --> 01:09:34,178
- What about the reporters?
- We let them film everything.

685
01:09:35,221 --> 01:09:37,121
Isn't that what you wanted?

686
01:09:38,125 --> 01:09:40,559
I'm not stupid, Sgt. Marchand.

687
01:09:42,462 --> 01:09:46,490
Ladies and gentleman, I am Capt. Dubois.

688
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:50,069
In a few minutes,
I will take you on the site.

689
01:09:50,304 --> 01:09:53,761
I suppose you all have your press cards,
helmets and flak jackets.

690
01:09:54,442 --> 01:09:56,967
Sgt. Marchand here
is going to brief you now.

691
01:09:57,411 --> 01:10:02,371
We have there a soldier that is laying
on a mine. We have to de-mine it.

692
01:10:03,217 --> 01:10:05,913
Nobody can go in the hole.
It's too dangerous.

693
01:10:06,153 --> 01:10:09,122
Don't go around because
we don't know if there are any mines.

694
01:10:10,458 --> 01:10:15,623
The situation is extremely complicated
and I want your total cooperation.

695
01:10:16,297 --> 01:10:18,561
Whoever will not respect the rules...

696
01:10:18,632 --> 01:10:21,726
...will be thrown out
and their press card will be confiscated.

697
01:10:22,770 --> 01:10:25,568
Go now into your cars.
We'll leave in a few minutes.

698
01:10:25,639 --> 01:10:26,970
Please go.

699
01:10:34,615 --> 01:10:37,947
- You never mentioned a man on a mine.
- I didn't?

700
01:10:38,886 --> 01:10:40,319
I forgot. Shall we go?

701
01:10:40,621 --> 01:10:43,556
- We wait for the mine expert.
- He isn't with you?

702
01:10:43,691 --> 01:10:46,318
Ours were busy.
They're sending a German.

703
01:10:46,594 --> 01:10:49,791
He should be here at 3:30. It's 3:30 now.

704
01:10:56,537 --> 01:10:58,095
Bang on the dot.

705
01:10:58,339 --> 01:10:59,431
What?

706
01:11:04,178 --> 01:11:05,907
Capt. Dubois. Do you speak French?

707
01:11:06,013 --> 01:11:06,843
No.

708
01:11:06,914 --> 01:11:08,745
- English, of course.
- Of course.

709
01:11:08,816 --> 01:11:11,842
- You know the situation?
- No, we had no time for a briefing.

710
01:11:12,053 --> 01:11:15,045
We don't have much time,
so you follow us, I will explain you.

711
01:11:15,222 --> 01:11:17,087
Over there. Follow us.

712
01:11:35,843 --> 01:11:40,143
At this very moment the UNPROFOR
are trying to help the third soldier...

713
01:11:40,214 --> 01:11:41,738
...who is lying on a mine.

714
01:11:42,016 --> 01:11:45,213
The absurdity of war continues,
taking on a different guise.

715
01:11:45,686 --> 01:11:48,848
How will all this end?
Stay tuned to Global News.

716
01:11:48,989 --> 01:11:51,513
Jane Livingston, live from Bosnia.

717
01:12:02,236 --> 01:12:03,396
Here.

718
01:12:06,540 --> 01:12:08,098
Excuse me...

719
01:12:09,043 --> 01:12:11,204
...can I make interview with you?

720
01:12:11,345 --> 01:12:14,473
Go fuck yourself!
You're the last thing I need.

721
01:12:17,418 --> 01:12:20,545
Fucking Balkanian.
What the fuck are you doing?

722
01:12:21,689 --> 01:12:23,316
- I just thought...
- Don't think.

723
01:12:23,390 --> 01:12:25,255
I'm the one who thinks around here.

724
01:12:30,564 --> 01:12:33,624
Excuse me, would you like a cigarette?

725
01:12:38,105 --> 01:12:40,732
Do you speak a little English?

726
01:12:43,077 --> 01:12:45,944
- Little.
- I can do interview with you?

727
01:12:47,781 --> 01:12:49,043
Roll.

728
01:12:50,718 --> 01:12:53,687
- How do you feel?
- Okay.

729
01:12:54,722 --> 01:12:57,019
- Do you feel tired?
- Yes.

730
01:12:58,092 --> 01:13:01,925
Was it you who put the mine
underneath the other soldier?

731
01:13:15,709 --> 01:13:17,233
Fucking bastard. Cut!

732
01:13:29,223 --> 01:13:32,192
I'll kill him, even if it's the last thing I do.

733
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:36,021
- What's wrong with you?
- I should have killed him.

734
01:13:37,097 --> 01:13:39,861
See that? I spared him and now...

735
01:13:40,034 --> 01:13:43,026
...he's tried to kill me with my own knife!

736
01:13:48,108 --> 01:13:49,700
How do you feel?

737
01:13:51,011 --> 01:13:53,946
Great. Couldn't be better.

738
01:13:55,149 --> 01:13:59,108
First, they shoot at me,
then I wake up on a mine...

739
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:02,917
...the whole world's watching me,
I need to shit...

740
01:14:03,524 --> 01:14:06,618
...and you piss me off
with your stupid stories.

741
01:14:09,463 --> 01:14:10,827
It'll soon be over.

742
01:14:22,509 --> 01:14:24,807
- You are okay?
- Yes, I'm ready.

743
01:14:25,779 --> 01:14:28,339
Now, I need everybody out of the place.

744
01:14:28,515 --> 01:14:31,678
We need the safety parameters
at least 30 meters.

745
01:14:32,152 --> 01:14:33,585
Okay. I'll do it.

746
01:14:33,721 --> 01:14:35,154
Move everybody out.

747
01:14:51,972 --> 01:14:55,702
Okay, please, now, you must go back.
We will start de-mining.

748
01:15:02,082 --> 01:15:03,913
Michel, let's get going!

749
01:15:06,053 --> 01:15:09,250
You must leave now.
De-miner wants everybody out.

750
01:15:09,523 --> 01:15:10,683
You, out.

751
01:15:13,227 --> 01:15:17,391
Yes, he out, too.
Later, when we finish. Understand?

752
01:15:17,865 --> 01:15:19,992
They'll bring him out later.

753
01:15:21,735 --> 01:15:24,202
If I need a translator, I'll find one.

754
01:15:24,271 --> 01:15:25,532
Let's go.

755
01:15:30,077 --> 01:15:31,066
Calm down!

756
01:15:31,145 --> 01:15:32,635
You cannot stay here, okay?

757
01:15:34,715 --> 01:15:37,684
Tell him if he stays here
we will not start working.

758
01:15:38,252 --> 01:15:40,516
It's a question of security.
Say it to your friend.

759
01:15:40,587 --> 01:15:41,884
He's not my friend.

760
01:15:42,222 --> 01:15:45,851
I know, but please,
I have no other translator. Tell him.

761
01:15:46,927 --> 01:15:51,522
- They'll do nothing until we go.
- I don't need a translator!

762
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,729
Go fuck yourself, asshole!

763
01:15:59,940 --> 01:16:02,875
Keep your cool. Just go.

764
01:16:06,513 --> 01:16:08,606
I'll wait for you up there.

765
01:16:11,218 --> 01:16:12,708
Keep an eye on him.

766
01:16:14,188 --> 01:16:15,348
Okay?

767
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:23,794
You can probably just make out
behind me, as I'm speaking to you...

768
01:16:23,997 --> 01:16:28,866
...the Serbian soldier, limping,
closely followed by the Bosnian soldier.

769
01:16:29,236 --> 01:16:32,797
These two men, at least,
will be walking to their safety.

770
01:16:32,906 --> 01:16:35,534
But they will be leaving behind
the third soldier...

771
01:16:35,809 --> 01:16:38,403
...who is still patiently waiting
on the mine...

772
01:16:38,579 --> 01:16:41,411
...for the bomb-disposal expert
to save his life.

773
01:16:41,548 --> 01:16:44,108
For him, the ordeal is not yet over.

774
01:16:44,551 --> 01:16:47,611
This is Jane Livingston, live from Bosnia...

775
01:16:47,721 --> 01:16:50,087
...for Global News. Stay tuned.

776
01:17:08,675 --> 01:17:09,937
Get lost!

777
01:17:11,612 --> 01:17:12,874
Fuck you!

778
01:17:17,484 --> 01:17:20,976
Asshole! I give him bandages
and he refuses them.

779
01:17:21,688 --> 01:17:23,451
They're all maniacs!

780
01:17:27,394 --> 01:17:30,625
<i>- It's John here. Are you still there?
- Yes. Hello?</i>

781
01:17:31,432 --> 01:17:35,869
Okay. Listen, this is really great,
but it would be fantastic if you could...

782
01:17:36,336 --> 01:17:38,429
...get the story of the guy on the mine.

783
01:17:38,505 --> 01:17:40,200
<i>I'll try. I mean...</i>

784
01:17:41,275 --> 01:17:45,210
Maybe you could get a close-up of him
when they're clearing the mine?

785
01:17:46,513 --> 01:17:47,912
<i>Yeah, I'll try.</i>

786
01:17:48,682 --> 01:17:50,946
Have you interviewed
the other two guys yet?

787
01:17:51,018 --> 01:17:54,454
<i>No, unfortunately they won't let me
get anywhere near them.</i>

788
01:17:55,255 --> 01:17:56,916
Go get it, Jane. Come on!

789
01:17:57,157 --> 01:18:00,558
As soon as you get it, we'll go live again.
Okay? Good luck.

790
01:18:00,828 --> 01:18:02,193
<i>Thank you.</i>

791
01:18:32,726 --> 01:18:34,090
Don't move.

792
01:18:54,681 --> 01:18:56,308
Fuck, what a job.

793
01:18:59,586 --> 01:19:02,851
They say a mine expert
only ever makes one mistake.

794
01:19:03,724 --> 01:19:05,783
- Two mistakes.
- How come?

795
01:19:07,361 --> 01:19:09,955
The first is when he chooses the job.

796
01:20:28,475 --> 01:20:30,033
What is happening?

797
01:20:31,311 --> 01:20:34,576
There's too much stones.
I can't approach the mine.

798
01:20:35,215 --> 01:20:37,979
I don't even see what kind of mine it is.

799
01:20:38,185 --> 01:20:39,618
I know. Wait.

800
01:20:51,465 --> 01:20:54,559
- Is this the mine that is under the body?
- Yeah.

801
01:21:06,079 --> 01:21:07,706
I can do nothing.

802
01:21:08,248 --> 01:21:10,808
- What?
- It's impossible to de-activate...

803
01:21:10,884 --> 01:21:13,876
...this kind of stuff
once the mechanism is on.

804
01:21:16,456 --> 01:21:19,323
This man is already dead.

805
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:23,557
Are you sure? Can't you put something
between him and the mine?

806
01:21:23,930 --> 01:21:25,898
Maybe another de-miner knows better.

807
01:21:26,233 --> 01:21:27,928
You can call whoever you want.

808
01:21:28,001 --> 01:21:32,904
Nobody, nothing in the world can de-mine
this stuff, not in these conditions.

809
01:21:33,507 --> 01:21:35,371
At least I don't know about it.

810
01:21:50,757 --> 01:21:53,384
Deus ex machina. He's all we needed.

811
01:22:31,832 --> 01:22:35,199
Why are you here? Do you consider it
such an important mission?

812
01:22:36,169 --> 01:22:39,036
We consider all our missions
to be of the utmost importance.

813
01:22:39,106 --> 01:22:42,768
Our job here is to expedite
the peace process in this country.

814
01:22:43,877 --> 01:22:46,903
You didn't want to intervene.
It was your soldiers...

815
01:22:47,214 --> 01:22:50,411
...who were sick and tired of waiting,
who initiated the action.

816
01:22:51,151 --> 01:22:54,018
I'm afraid you got
the wrong end of the story here.

817
01:22:54,121 --> 01:22:57,181
This is a simple new system of command.

818
01:22:57,657 --> 01:23:01,593
If it's effective, then the unit in the field
will have much greater mobility.

819
01:23:02,195 --> 01:23:04,663
What do you have to say about
the Americans' accusations...

820
01:23:04,765 --> 01:23:08,792
...that Europe's incapacity to do anything
is due to UNPROFOR's internal problems?

821
01:23:09,236 --> 01:23:12,433
I've heard no such accusations.
You must judge for yourself.

822
01:23:12,706 --> 01:23:16,437
The UNPROFOR is perfectly fulfilling
its mission. Thank you very much.

823
01:23:16,943 --> 01:23:20,106
What are the relationships between
the British and the French?

824
01:23:20,247 --> 01:23:23,614
I think we'll have to deal with that later.
It's far too complicated.

825
01:23:26,686 --> 01:23:28,313
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

826
01:23:28,688 --> 01:23:30,622
- How's it going?
- We have a problem, sir.

827
01:23:30,690 --> 01:23:32,919
- What problem?
- One of the soldiers is on a mine.

828
01:23:32,993 --> 01:23:34,221
It's impossible to defuse it.

829
01:23:34,294 --> 01:23:35,260
What?

830
01:23:35,495 --> 01:23:38,555
The mine disposal expert says
it is impossible to defuse it.

831
01:23:41,268 --> 01:23:45,671
This whole fucking business stinks
to high heaven, as I said from the start.

832
01:23:47,474 --> 01:23:51,342
If the journalists get one whiff of this,
they'll crucify us.

833
01:23:52,078 --> 01:23:52,840
Shit.

834
01:23:53,146 --> 01:23:55,978
What did you decide?
What are we going to do?

835
01:23:56,249 --> 01:23:58,911
Get back into the trench.
Pretend to be busy.

836
01:23:59,252 --> 01:24:02,119
- We've got to buy ourselves some time.
- Excuse me to repeat...

837
01:24:02,189 --> 01:24:04,680
Get back into the trench!

838
01:24:06,193 --> 01:24:07,660
That's an order.

839
01:24:30,650 --> 01:24:32,344
Captain, what's happening?

840
01:24:32,419 --> 01:24:35,616
The mine disposal expert
has begun his job.

841
01:24:35,989 --> 01:24:39,891
You will be informed
as soon as he will be finished.

842
01:24:40,393 --> 01:24:43,556
- I think it's going to take a little while.
- Can we approach?

843
01:24:43,630 --> 01:24:47,396
Unfortunately, for security reasons,
I cannot allow that.

844
01:24:47,467 --> 01:24:49,991
You wanted to kill me with my own knife?

845
01:24:50,403 --> 01:24:51,392
Oh, shit.

846
01:24:51,671 --> 01:24:53,104
Quick! Tom!

847
01:24:53,306 --> 01:24:55,500
Is that how you thank me?

848
01:24:56,509 --> 01:24:58,033
Don't come any closer!

849
01:24:59,246 --> 01:25:00,577
You're all the same!

850
01:25:00,647 --> 01:25:02,740
And you vultures film it?

851
01:25:03,116 --> 01:25:06,279
You get good money?
Does our misery pay well?

852
01:25:07,621 --> 01:25:08,610
No!

853
01:25:28,108 --> 01:25:29,939
- Did you get it?
- Yes.

854
01:25:38,084 --> 01:25:41,053
Captain? Over here, please.

855
01:25:55,969 --> 01:25:57,163
What do you think...

856
01:25:57,237 --> 01:25:58,761
Take it easy.

857
01:26:00,774 --> 01:26:02,036
<i>Listen...</i>

858
01:26:03,443 --> 01:26:05,570
There was no other solution.

859
01:26:06,413 --> 01:26:09,575
Marchand! Put the bodies in the car.
We're going.

860
01:26:10,116 --> 01:26:13,176
- What's happening?
- The mine expert's defused it.

861
01:26:13,687 --> 01:26:15,211
- He has?
- Yes.

862
01:26:51,925 --> 01:26:53,756
Colonel, sir,
can we just have a few questions?

863
01:26:54,594 --> 01:26:58,325
Ladies and gentleman, what can I say?
You see the conditions we work under.

864
01:26:58,398 --> 01:27:00,992
Our focus now must be
on the remaining soldier.

865
01:27:01,067 --> 01:27:03,331
We hope to be able to save
at least one life.

866
01:27:03,703 --> 01:27:06,103
- Can we come closer? Can we film it?
- Eventually.

867
01:27:06,172 --> 01:27:09,699
He's in critical condition and has to be
taken to a hospital immediately.

868
01:27:09,976 --> 01:27:14,106
When he's in a fit state to answer
your questions, you'll be informed.

869
01:27:14,848 --> 01:27:19,342
The press conference tonight
at 22:00 at the Holiday Inn...

870
01:27:19,719 --> 01:27:22,984
...at which time I shall be happy to answer
any of your questions.

871
01:27:23,056 --> 01:27:26,718
For the time being, I must ask you please
to prepare to leave the field...

872
01:27:26,793 --> 01:27:30,661
...since I can no longer guarantee
your safety. Night is beginning to fall.

873
01:27:30,964 --> 01:27:33,558
Please, ladies and gentlemen,
prepare to go.

874
01:27:35,468 --> 01:27:36,799
Thank you.

875
01:28:10,170 --> 01:28:12,866
- What's going on?
- We took out the mine expert's gear.

876
01:28:12,939 --> 01:28:16,466
- What about him?
- Lf you have an idea, let me know.

877
01:28:16,543 --> 01:28:19,875
- We can't leave him there!
- You have a solution?

878
01:28:21,614 --> 01:28:23,638
You heard the mine expert.

879
01:28:26,619 --> 01:28:28,643
I hope you understand now.

880
01:28:29,022 --> 01:28:31,923
It's not our business, so we stay out of it.

881
01:28:32,959 --> 01:28:36,053
Everything all right, Captain?
Good work, gentlemen.

882
01:28:37,097 --> 01:28:38,758
I'm very pleased.

883
01:28:38,865 --> 01:28:42,699
I have no doubt that in the fullness of time
you'll be duly compensated.

884
01:28:53,780 --> 01:28:56,146
You've got the contact numbers
from Dubois?

885
01:28:56,749 --> 01:28:59,581
Call them, will you,
and notify them that they're dead.

886
01:29:00,520 --> 01:29:03,512
Then I'd like you to notify each side...

887
01:29:03,590 --> 01:29:06,320
...that we have information
that the other side...

888
01:29:06,392 --> 01:29:09,452
...is planning to commandeer
the central trench this evening.

889
01:29:11,998 --> 01:29:16,230
Could you call me the liaison
of the Bosnians, please? Thank you.

890
01:29:19,939 --> 01:29:23,102
- Well, see you round.
- See you.

891
01:29:25,111 --> 01:29:27,135
I wanted to thank you.

892
01:29:30,283 --> 01:29:32,911
- You got your report.
- Yes.

893
01:29:36,523 --> 01:29:38,013
Are you okay?

894
01:29:39,325 --> 01:29:41,259
- Ready to go?
- Sorry?

895
01:29:41,427 --> 01:29:43,258
- Are you ready to go?
- Yes.

896
01:29:43,329 --> 01:29:45,695
Let's not hang around, let's go.

897
01:29:47,467 --> 01:29:50,231
- I hope we meet again.
- I hope so.

898
01:29:50,770 --> 01:29:53,739
Remember the press conference tonight,
22:00, all right?

899
01:29:53,873 --> 01:29:54,964
Yes.

900
01:29:59,579 --> 01:30:01,843
I know what you're thinking, Sergeant.

901
01:30:02,448 --> 01:30:06,475
It wouldn't make any difference, you know.
It wouldn't change anything.

902
01:30:08,288 --> 01:30:09,687
Off you go.

903
01:30:15,428 --> 01:30:18,295
Are you sure you don't want me
to film the trench?

904
01:30:20,033 --> 01:30:23,867
No. A trench is a trench.
They're all the same.
