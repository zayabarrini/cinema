1
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,500
It's raining today.

2
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,800
Not playing in the yard.

3
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,300
There will be plenty of mud.

4
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,799
If you slip, you shall hurt you.

5
00:01:20,399 --> 00:01:22,199
-- Play inside.
-- Okay.

6
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:26,499
And do not walk under the trees.

7
00:01:27,399 --> 00:01:29,098
A tree fell yesterday

8
00:01:29,398 --> 00:01:32,298
a bridge collapsed,
it was on the news.

9
00:01:32,698 --> 00:01:34,498
But it stopped raining.

10
00:01:35,598 --> 00:01:37,497
It can resume.

11
00:01:39,397 --> 00:01:40,497
Here it is.

12
00:01:40,797 --> 00:01:41,897
Wait!

13
00:01:43,897 --> 00:01:45,097
A minute!

14
00:02:14,594 --> 00:02:16,093
Thou hast put all the spices?

15
00:02:16,393 --> 00:02:18,693
No Auntie, I forgot one.

16
00:02:19,693 --> 00:02:21,793
I felt, the whistling!

17
00:02:23,293 --> 00:02:23,893
Want.

18
00:02:27,492 --> 00:02:28,892
Thank you, Auntie.

19
00:02:30,792 --> 00:02:32,692
Just a pinch.

20
00:02:32,992 --> 00:02:34,092
Okay.

21
00:02:35,891 --> 00:02:39,091
This new recipe will work.

22
00:02:39,391 --> 00:02:40,191
Are you sure?

23
00:02:40,391 --> 00:02:42,891
You doubt,

24
00:02:43,191 --> 00:02:44,690
but you'll see.

25
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:49,590
Yum ... perfect!

26
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:54,289
A mouthful,
and he will build you a Taj Mahal.

27
00:02:54,789 --> 00:02:56,489
The Taj Mahal is a tomb.

28
00:02:56,989 --> 00:02:58,489
I know!

29
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,288
Retrieves them.

30
00:06:26,667 --> 00:06:27,467
Fernandes.

31
00:06:28,167 --> 00:06:30,967
I present Shaikh.
Shaikh, Mr Fernandes.

32
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:34,267
He was chief accountant
in a small Saudi company.

33
00:06:34,466 --> 00:06:37,166
He will take your notes to your departure
in one month.

34
00:06:37,566 --> 00:06:39,266
It has very good references.

35
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:40,366
Delighted.

36
00:06:41,366 --> 00:06:43,166
Mr. Shroff fill you with praise.

37
00:06:43,366 --> 00:06:46,565
I did come early
for you to truly form.

38
00:06:48,765 --> 00:06:49,665
Good luck.

39
00:06:54,764 --> 00:06:58,664
Mr. Shroff said it 35 years
you're here.

40
00:06:59,964 --> 00:07:02,564
Your colleagues will miss you.

41
00:07:04,363 --> 00:07:07,463
What does it do?

42
00:07:08,763 --> 00:07:12,463
This is the beginning of your golden age,
how do you feel?

43
00:07:13,462 --> 00:07:14,362
Beautifully.

44
00:07:14,562 --> 00:07:15,862
Awesome!

45
00:07:28,561 --> 00:07:30,261
Can we start training?

46
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,860
Course.

47
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,260
But it's lunchtime.

48
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,259
Return to 16 h 45.

49
00:07:45,659 --> 00:07:47,659
Well, at any hour.

50
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:48,959
Thank you!

51
00:10:00,745 --> 00:10:04,945
<i> Today
the recipe for one of my favorite dishes: </ i>

52
00:10:05,145 --> 00:10:06,644
<i> "paneer pyaza do." </ i>

53
00:10:36,741 --> 00:10:38,041
Auntie!

54
00:10:38,741 --> 00:10:40,941
-- Do you sleep?
-- What happened?

55
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:43,041
The lunchbox is back.

56
00:10:43,341 --> 00:10:44,940
Then?

57
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,840
It is empty.

58
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,440
Is that true?

59
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,640
Completely!

60
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,540
It all sauced!

61
00:10:54,939 --> 00:10:58,439
What did I tell you?
And this is just the beginning!

62
00:13:03,026 --> 00:13:05,426
Stops the tape,
Rajeev is back.

63
00:13:05,626 --> 00:13:06,526
Okay.

64
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:14,425
You're home early, the better.

65
00:13:27,923 --> 00:13:29,523
Did you like your breakfast?

66
00:13:29,723 --> 00:13:30,623
It was good.

67
00:13:35,723 --> 00:13:38,222
Well ... no more?

68
00:13:39,122 --> 00:13:40,922
As everyday.

69
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:47,221
The lunchbox was empty,
then I thought ...

70
00:13:48,021 --> 00:13:50,621
Cauliflower was very good.

71
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,720
It was very good.

72
00:14:07,219 --> 00:14:08,219
I just got back.

73
00:14:09,719 --> 00:14:11,419
I was expecting your call.

74
00:14:16,818 --> 00:14:18,418
It was so boring?

75
00:14:23,518 --> 00:14:24,917
I left early too.

76
00:14:47,215 --> 00:14:48,815
A problem, sir?

77
00:14:49,715 --> 00:14:51,515
I retire.

78
00:14:51,715 --> 00:14:53,814
I would like to stop delivery.

79
00:14:54,114 --> 00:14:56,814
Okay, I take note.

80
00:14:57,614 --> 00:14:59,814
I will pay you at the end of the month.

81
00:15:00,214 --> 00:15:01,814
No problem.

82
00:15:03,513 --> 00:15:06,613
And. .. who cooked today?

83
00:15:07,713 --> 00:15:11,013
Us, why?

84
00:15:11,213 --> 00:15:12,912
It was good!

85
00:15:14,212 --> 00:15:16,212
-- What?
-- It was very good.

86
00:15:17,012 --> 00:15:18,812
Continue on this path.

87
00:15:25,811 --> 00:15:26,811
What has?

88
00:15:27,011 --> 00:15:28,711
Cauliflower liked him.

89
00:15:28,911 --> 00:15:30,511
Do it again tomorrow.

90
00:15:30,711 --> 00:15:32,010
Like, serve it.

91
00:15:44,509 --> 00:15:45,609
What do you do?

92
00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:53,408
Mr. Fernandes, our ball fell
at home. It can recover?

93
00:15:53,608 --> 00:15:54,708
Please!

94
00:16:01,007 --> 00:16:03,107
-- I look like a maid?
-- No.

95
00:16:03,707 --> 00:16:06,407
It will no longer play here.
We'll go to the other side.

96
00:16:06,707 --> 00:16:10,206
If you replay here, I hunt you.

97
00:16:11,906 --> 00:16:12,906
Please!

98
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:15,906
We'll play somewhere else!

99
00:16:54,602 --> 00:16:55,802
I'm here, Auntie.

100
00:16:56,002 --> 00:16:57,802
You called me just now?

101
00:16:58,401 --> 00:16:59,001
Yes.

102
00:16:59,301 --> 00:17:01,401
I changed diapers Tonton.

103
00:17:02,601 --> 00:17:03,801
Rajeev has said?

104
00:17:05,801 --> 00:17:06,701
Nothing.

105
00:17:07,101 --> 00:17:08,000
What?

106
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,200
The lunchbox was delivered elsewhere.

107
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,900
I do not think Rajeev has received it.

108
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,199
Someone else ate the meal.

109
00:17:18,399 --> 00:17:22,699
But they are never wrong,
impossible.

110
00:17:28,498 --> 00:17:29,598
What does he?

111
00:18:39,491 --> 00:18:41,191
Hello, how are you?

112
00:18:41,491 --> 00:18:42,691
Good morning.

113
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:46,890
When I returned,
you were not there.

114
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:50,090
-- You were late.
-- I came to 16 h 45 accurate.

115
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:51,990
I was there, you were late.

116
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:53,789
No problem.

117
00:18:58,889 --> 00:19:00,389
These are the claims?

118
00:19:01,689 --> 00:19:03,588
It is the claims service here.

119
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:08,688
When do we start my training?

120
00:19:08,888 --> 00:19:09,988
Let's go.

121
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:15,587
Now?

122
00:19:16,087 --> 00:19:17,487
After lunch.

123
00:19:18,387 --> 00:19:20,987
-- I'll be back after then?
-- Yes, come.

124
00:19:21,187 --> 00:19:22,786
-- Are you sure?
-- Yes.

125
00:19:22,986 --> 00:19:24,486
You will be right there?

126
00:19:26,486 --> 00:19:27,786
Thank you.

127
00:20:56,577 --> 00:20:58,976
<i> Thank you all ate yesterday. </ i>

128
00:20:59,476 --> 00:21:02,576
<i> I cooked this dish for my husband. </ i>

129
00:21:03,176 --> 00:21:04,476
<i> Seeing the empty box, </ i>

130
00:21:04,976 --> 00:21:07,575
<i> I thought it welcome me
coming back. </ i>

131
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:10,075
<i> I thought,
Within a few hours </ i>

132
00:21:10,275 --> 00:21:12,175
<i> that satisfy the stomach,
it was to seduce the heart. </ i>

133
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:13,875
<i> thank you </ i>

134
00:21:14,075 --> 00:21:15,375
<i> here paneer. </ i>

135
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,374
<i> favorite dish of my husband. </ i>

136
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:25,874
Auntie, this letter is weird.

137
00:21:26,274 --> 00:21:28,473
Ila, you should thank him.

138
00:21:30,173 --> 00:21:31,973
And if it is Rajeev who receives?

139
00:21:32,173 --> 00:21:33,373
Better.

140
00:21:33,873 --> 00:21:36,972
He eats meals someone else.

141
00:21:37,272 --> 00:21:39,172
His noticing today!

142
00:21:43,372 --> 00:21:44,772
I do not write anything else?

143
00:21:44,972 --> 00:21:47,171
No, it should remain short!

144
00:22:13,469 --> 00:22:14,668
You sleep?

145
00:22:14,868 --> 00:22:15,768
Then?

146
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:18,368
The lunchbox is back.

147
00:22:18,568 --> 00:22:21,568
Empty yet. With a reply.

148
00:22:21,968 --> 00:22:23,568
-- A response?
-- Yes.

149
00:22:23,768 --> 00:22:25,167
Read it to me.

150
00:22:25,367 --> 00:22:27,467
This is not writing Rajeev.

151
00:22:27,667 --> 00:22:29,167
And what does it say then?

152
00:22:30,167 --> 00:22:33,267
"Dear Ila. Food
today was very salty. "

153
00:22:33,467 --> 00:22:34,466
And what else?

154
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:37,166
"The food
today was very salty. "

155
00:22:37,366 --> 00:22:39,466
What? No "thank you", no?

156
00:22:40,066 --> 00:22:42,366
"The food
today was very salty. "

157
00:22:42,566 --> 00:22:46,465
Who does it?
It swallows everything and he complains?

158
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,065
A minute.

159
00:22:50,865 --> 00:22:52,365
Here, put--in.

160
00:22:54,064 --> 00:22:55,864
No, it bothers me.

161
00:22:56,064 --> 00:22:59,364
I say to the driver
there was an error.

162
00:23:00,064 --> 00:23:01,964
It should thank you!

163
00:23:02,164 --> 00:23:04,863
No, I really do not like it.

164
00:23:05,063 --> 00:23:06,963
Why? You do not know.

165
00:23:20,662 --> 00:23:22,661
Good morning. How are you?

166
00:23:23,461 --> 00:23:24,361
Property.

167
00:23:29,161 --> 00:23:32,660
You were not at your desk,
I came here.

168
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,760
You read in the canteen,
I do not want to bother.

169
00:23:43,959 --> 00:23:46,259
Your meal exhales a delicious aroma.

170
00:23:46,459 --> 00:23:49,459
I tasted the food
just by feeling!

171
00:23:58,158 --> 00:23:59,658
Your wife ...

172
00:24:00,757 --> 00:24:02,657
has magic in his hands.

173
00:24:04,357 --> 00:24:05,957
My wife is dead.

174
00:27:00,139 --> 00:27:03,238
<i> Dear Ila, salt,
it was this time. </ i>

175
00:27:03,438 --> 00:27:05,938
<i> It was perhaps a little spicy ... </ i>

176
00:27:06,438 --> 00:27:10,438
<i> but I ate two bananas for dessert,
they extinguished the fire. </ i>

177
00:27:11,538 --> 00:27:14,137
<i> And it's good for my circulation. </ i>

178
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:20,137
<i> So many people </ i>

179
00:27:20,337 --> 00:27:23,136
<i> simply a banana or two
at noon. </ i>

181
00:27:47,434 --> 00:27:48,334
<i> Hello. </ i>

182
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:50,933
<i> My husband came home late last night. </ i>

183
00:27:53,233 --> 00:27:54,633
<i> He did not say a word. </ i>

184
00:27:58,433 --> 00:28:01,532
<i> This morning, he went to work,

185
00:28:01,832 --> 00:28:05,432
<i> And I cooked with Auntie Deshpande. </ i>

186
00:28:06,132 --> 00:28:09,331
<i> This is our upstairs neighbor. </ i>

187

Her husband is immersed <i>
in a coma for 15 years. </ i>

188
00:28:13,631 --> 00:28:17,131
<i> One day he woke up

<i> and falls asleep at night. </ i>

191
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:27,930
<i> Upon awakening, he went back to fix it. </ i>

192
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:29,529
<i> He said nothing. </ i>

193
00:28:30,029 --> 00:28:32,129
<i> For 15 years. </ i>

194
00:28:32,629 --> 00:28:35,129
<i> Even doctors have lost all hope. </ i>

195
00:28:35,829 --> 00:28:38,328
<i> This is an old model fan. </ i>

196
00:28:39,228 --> 00:28:41,028
<i> It is never extinguished. </ i>

197
00:28:41,628 --> 00:28:45,728
Auntie <i> think it keeps him alive. </ i>

198
00:28:46,628 --> 00:28:48,927
<i> One day, there was
a power outage. </ i>

199
00:28:49,927 --> 00:28:52,427
<i> He stopped

200
00:28:52,627 --> 00:28:54,727
<i> Fortunately, the electricity came back. </ i>

201
00:28:59,826 --> 00:29:02,926

202
00:29:05,026 --> 00:29:07,525
Her husband continues <i>

203
00:29:07,725 --> 00:29:09,325

205
00:29:12,925 --> 00:29:14,525
<i> This may be the case. </ i>

206
00:29:19,024 --> 00:29:20,524
What do we live?

207
00:29:33,023 --> 00:29:35,822
<i> Dear Ila,
Your husband seems to be busy. </ I>

208
00:29:36,022 --> 00:29:37,822
<i> Today
people are very busy. </ i>

209
00:29:38,022 --> 00:29:39,222
<i> There are too many people, </ i>

210
00:29:39,422 --> 00:29:41,722
<i> and everyone wants
that the other features. </ i>

211
00:29:43,622 --> 00:29:47,221
<i> Before, you could
sit in the train, </ i>

212
00:29:47,421 --> 00:29:49,221
<i> but nowadays, it's hard. </ i>

213
00:29:49,421 --> 00:29:51,621
<i> If Mr. Deshpande was waking up, </ i>

214
00:29:51,821 --> 00:29:55,520
<i> it probably prefer
his fan. </ i>

215
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:01,020
<i> When my wife died,
she had a horizontal fall. </ i>

216
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:05,519
<i> I wanted to buy one for me,
but they had </ i>

217
00:30:05,719 --> 00:30:07,119
<i> as vertical. </ i>

218
00:30:08,019 --> 00:30:10,319
<i> I spent my whole life standing. </ i>

219
00:30:10,619 --> 00:30:13,119
<i> It will be the same in my death. </ i>

220
00:30:16,118 --> 00:30:18,118
<i> Why do not you
another child? </ i>

221
00:30:19,618 --> 00:30:22,718
<i> It can sometimes help a marriage. </ i>

222
00:30:43,315 --> 00:30:44,515
Rajeev?

223
00:30:45,315 --> 00:30:46,615
What do you say?

224
00:30:47,215 --> 00:30:48,315
It's pretty.

225
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,414
You forgot?

226
00:30:55,014 --> 00:30:57,614
I reach
during our honeymoon.

227
00:30:58,414 --> 00:31:02,513
I wanted to see
if she needed alterations.

228
00:31:02,913 --> 00:31:05,913
But it suits me very well,

229
00:31:06,113 --> 00:31:07,313
-- Right?
-- Yes.

230
00:31:07,513 --> 00:31:09,013
It is a little wide.

231
00:31:09,213 --> 00:31:10,313
Yes ...

232
00:31:15,612 --> 00:31:19,512
On our return, we did not know
Yashvi that happened.

233
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:22,011
It was known much later.

234
00:31:23,311 --> 00:31:25,311
Two months later!

235
00:31:40,309 --> 00:31:43,109
We did not have much
at the time.

236
00:31:47,909 --> 00:31:50,608
When she was born,
luck smiled on us.

237
00:31:51,208 --> 00:31:54,608
Everything is so expensive today,
luck is not enough.

238
00:31:55,308 --> 00:31:57,708
Why you prepare me
cauliflower every day?

239
00:31:58,008 --> 00:31:59,507
You have a stock to sell?

240
00:32:11,806 --> 00:32:12,706
Rajeev.

241
00:32:14,606 --> 00:32:17,906
And if Yashvi had a little brother
or sister?

242
00:32:18,106 --> 00:32:19,705
You had a brother you.

243
00:32:21,205 --> 00:32:22,305
And ...

244
00:32:26,605 --> 00:32:30,904
I pray thee, over cauliflower,
it gives me gas.

245
00:33:29,798 --> 00:33:32,098
Cars, buses, airplanes:

246
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:34,698
all trapped in Mumbai we are.

247
00:33:35,697 --> 00:33:37,797
This road is bottled
since this morning.

248
00:33:38,797 --> 00:33:41,897
You see this tower?

249
00:33:42,797 --> 00:33:45,896
A woman jumped this morning
with his little girl.

250
00:33:49,296 --> 00:33:51,096
She jumped?

251
00:33:53,996 --> 00:33:55,295
What was it?

252
00:33:55,995 --> 00:33:58,795
I do not know.
I do not know.

253
00:34:02,995 --> 00:34:05,294
Surely domestic problems.

254
00:34:06,394 --> 00:34:08,794
You know someone
who lives there?

255
00:34:11,194 --> 00:34:12,594
She did not survive?

256
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:38,985
<i> Hello. </ i>

257
00:35:39,585 --> 00:35:41,684
<i> this morning
my husband went to the office ... </ i>

258
00:35:41,984 --> 00:35:44,284
Hello, sir.
How are you?

259
00:35:45,384 --> 00:35:46,684
I'm busy.

260
00:35:48,184 --> 00:35:49,783
And my training?

261
00:35:49,983 --> 00:35:53,083
It's lunchtime.
Check back later.

262
00:36:01,282 --> 00:36:04,082
I was told to expect nothing
on your part.

263
00:36:10,081 --> 00:36:12,981
I'm Aslam Shaikh.
I'm an orphan.

264
00:36:14,581 --> 00:36:16,581
I gave myself that name.

265
00:36:17,381 --> 00:36:19,980
All I know
I taught myself.

266
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:22,780
And I also teach this work.
I finished. Thank you.

267
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:25,880
Listen.

268
00:36:28,279 --> 00:36:29,379
Come on.

269
00:36:38,378 --> 00:36:39,678
Go to my office.

270
00:36:39,978 --> 00:36:42,778
There are records
of Ahmedabad sector.

271
00:36:42,978 --> 00:36:44,178
Calculate the amounts

272
00:36:44,378 --> 00:36:46,678
and prepare payment orders
for accounting.

273
00:36:47,677 --> 00:36:49,077
Thank you very much.

274
00:36:51,177 --> 00:36:52,277
Thank you very much.

275
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,377
I'll be right back.

276
00:36:54,577 --> 00:36:56,777
No, do not come back, go to work.

277
00:36:56,976 --> 00:36:58,776
Yes sir, thank you very much.

278
00:37:04,276 --> 00:37:07,775
<i> This morning my husband went to the office
and Yashvi school. </ i>

279
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:11,075
<i> I listened to the news on the radio. </ i>

282
00:37:17,274 --> 00:37:19,574

285
00:37:27,673 --> 00:37:29,773
<i> Maybe she has removed her jewelry ... </ i>

00:37:30,573 --> 00:37:32,573

We play what, Mom?

290

<i> It must have been difficult
reaching to the roof. </ i>

291
00:37:52,371 --> 00:37:55,270
<i> Must we not courage
to jump as well? </ i>

292
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:04,569
<i> Dear Ila,
do not see it that way. </ i>

293
00:38:04,769 --> 00:38:07,569
They never go <i>
as bad as you think. </ i>

294
00:38:07,769 --> 00:38:10,869
<i> One day on the train

295
00:38:11,069 --> 00:38:13,269

<i> down ... </ i>

298
00:39:04,863 --> 00:39:06,363
You laugh?

299
00:39:07,963 --> 00:39:08,963
Yes, Auntie.

300
00:39:10,763 --> 00:39:11,962
A joke.

301
00:39:12,162 --> 00:39:13,762
Tell!

302
00:39:13,962 --> 00:39:15,062
I forgot.

303
00:39:15,262 --> 00:39:16,762
-- You forgot?
-- Yes.

304
00:39:17,362 --> 00:39:19,662
Soak almonds 5 am every night.

305
00:39:19,862 --> 00:39:21,861
And eat them in the morning.

306
00:39:22,061 --> 00:39:23,561
It strengthens memory.

307
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:25,361
Noted.

308
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:32,360
How are you?

309
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:35,660
-- You go to the station?
-- Yes.

310
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:39,859
I get off at Central Station
Bombay.

311
00:39:40,059 --> 00:39:42,359
I live in Dongri.

312
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:43,459
And you?

313
00:39:43,659 --> 00:39:44,759
At Bandra.

314
00:39:53,158 --> 00:39:55,258
Can I ask you a question?

315
00:39:56,158 --> 00:39:57,058
Yes.

316
00:40:00,657 --> 00:40:02,757
At the office, it is said that walking ...

317
00:40:08,057 --> 00:40:10,756
you gave a kick
a cat.

318
00:40:13,556 --> 00:40:17,456
A bus has crashed and you have continued
your way, nonchalantly.

319
00:40:18,655 --> 00:40:19,655
Is that true?

320
00:40:22,355 --> 00:40:24,955
It was not a cat.
But a blind man.

321
00:40:25,155 --> 00:40:26,355
He asked his way,

322
00:40:26,555 --> 00:40:29,354
so I pushed
and a coach ran into him.

323
00:40:37,753 --> 00:40:39,153
So be careful.

324
00:40:42,553 --> 00:40:43,653
Thank you.

325
00:40:46,953 --> 00:40:48,452
Give me a cigarette.

326
00:40:49,652 --> 00:40:51,052
I'll pay later.

327
00:40:55,152 --> 00:40:56,651
This is a joke, right?

328
00:40:58,351 --> 00:41:01,151
Have you always lived in Bandra?

329
00:41:03,051 --> 00:41:04,651
Yes, always.

330
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:08,350
I move constantly.

331
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:11,650
At first, I was way Muhammad Ali.

332
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:15,050
Then I went to Dubai,
then in Saudi Arabia.

333
00:41:16,149 --> 00:41:18,349
I was commuting
between there and here.

334
00:41:18,549 --> 00:41:22,249
But after meeting Meherunissa,
I stayed.

335
00:41:24,349 --> 00:41:25,848
I cut vegetables here

336
00:41:26,048 --> 00:41:29,048
and I cook when I get home.

337
00:41:29,248 --> 00:41:31,248
Where did you learn to do that?

338
00:41:32,348 --> 00:41:34,248
Before I worked in a hotel.

339
00:41:34,947 --> 00:41:36,147
A hotel?

340
00:41:36,347 --> 00:41:39,847
Kitchen, room service,
accounting ...

341
00:41:40,147 --> 00:41:41,847
All in one.

342
00:41:43,247 --> 00:41:45,246
It is dry in Saudi Arabia.

343
00:41:45,746 --> 00:41:49,546
No entertainment:
work--prayer, prayer--work ...

344
00:41:49,746 --> 00:41:52,046
Here I have free time.

345
00:41:52,746 --> 00:41:58,245
I cook for Meherunissa,
we eat when she gets home.

346
00:41:58,945 --> 00:42:01,745
-- And then we walk.
-- Very well.

347
00:42:05,844 --> 00:42:07,644
I love her more than anything.

348
00:42:10,244 --> 00:42:11,744
That evening you doing?

349
00:42:14,943 --> 00:42:18,443
I watch TV sometimes.

350
00:42:27,342 --> 00:42:28,942
Come to me.

351
00:42:29,842 --> 00:42:31,442
-- Where?
-- My house.

352
00:42:34,041 --> 00:42:35,941
I will make you a "Pasanda".

353
00:42:36,141 --> 00:42:38,241
-- A what?
-- "Pasanda".

354
00:42:38,441 --> 00:42:41,741
-- What is it?
-- A dish made with lamb.

355
00:42:41,941 --> 00:42:44,940
You cut it like that.

356
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:47,040
-- From the lamb?
-- Yes.

357
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,240
My specialty.

358
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:50,840
I will come.

359
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,539
-- Now.
-- Right now?

360
00:42:52,739 --> 00:42:53,839
Yes, please!

361
00:42:55,339 --> 00:42:59,839
No, I work another time.

362
00:43:01,438 --> 00:43:03,438
Next time promised?

363
00:43:04,538 --> 00:43:06,038
I can wait ...

364
00:43:06,238 --> 00:43:07,438
Next time.

365
00:43:09,238 --> 00:43:11,237
-- See you soon.
-- Goodbye.

366
00:43:55,533 --> 00:43:58,633
<i> Hello.
My husband came home late yesterday. </ I>

367
00:43:59,132 --> 00:44:01,232
<i> He returned to work
after a call. </ i>

368
00:44:01,532 --> 00:44:03,132

369
00:44:03,932 --> 00:44:07,832
<i> my marriage, I took business
without telling my mother. </ i>

370
00:44:08,731 --> 00:44:11,231
<i> I found an old book. </ i>

371
00:44:12,131 --> 00:44:14,031
<i> It contains recipes
my grandmother. </ i>

372
00:44:14,231 --> 00:44:16,031
<i> I found an apple. </ i>

00:44:16,231 --> 00:44:17,531
<i> Tis the season. </ i>

374
00:44:18,830 --> 00:44:21,030
<i> I think you'll like it. </ i>

375
00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:23,730
Excellent!

376
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:25,530
How are you?

377
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:27,430
I can sit?

378
00:44:28,329 --> 00:44:29,329
Please.

379
00:44:29,829 --> 00:44:30,629
Thank you.

380
00:44:37,928 --> 00:44:40,228
Want a taste?

381
00:44:41,128 --> 00:44:42,228
Are you sure?

382
00:44:43,128 --> 00:44:44,128
Yes.

383
00:45:05,926 --> 00:45:06,925
What does he?

384
00:45:10,325 --> 00:45:11,725
Where does this meal?

385
00:45:12,525 --> 00:45:16,624
A restaurant near me.

386
00:45:17,724 --> 00:45:18,724
Why?

387
00:45:19,924 --> 00:45:21,024
It is delicious.

388
00:45:22,024 --> 00:45:24,924
Book a meal for me.

389
00:45:25,923 --> 00:45:27,223
They close soon.

390
00:45:27,823 --> 00:45:30,023
With food so delicious?

391
00:45:30,223 --> 00:45:32,923
The talent is not rewarded
in this country.

392
00:45:35,622 --> 00:45:39,422
You are right, sir.

393
00:45:39,922 --> 00:45:41,522
It must be magic
in his hands.

394
00:45:41,722 --> 00:45:45,221
Everyone can cook,
but it must be magic.

395
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:03,320
<i> Dear Ila,
this recipe was very good. </ i>

396
00:46:03,919 --> 00:46:06,519
<i> Better than my favorite dish,
eggplant. </ i>

397
00:46:06,719 --> 00:46:09,719
<i> Yesterday, I also
found something. </ i>

You probably were <i>

400
00:46:25,517 --> 00:46:27,117
<i> My wife loved them. </ i>

401
00:46:27,717 --> 00:46:30,217
<i> I wanted to watch,
who knows why. </ i>

402
00:46:30,917 --> 00:46:32,716
<i> I have watched for hours. </ i>

403
00:46:33,816 --> 00:46:37,216
<i> Episode after episode. </ i>

404
00:46:39,316 --> 00:46:41,616
<i> After spending the night </ i>

405
00:46:41,915 --> 00:46:44,615
<i> I understood what I was looking for. </ i>

406
00:46:45,615 --> 00:46:48,015
<i> Every Sunday

407
00:46:48,215 --> 00:46:51,514
<i> I stood outside,
fix my bike or smoke. </ i>

408
00:46:51,714 --> 00:46:54,514
<i> I threw him a glance
from time to time. </ i>

409
00:46:55,414 --> 00:46:58,614
<i> And I saw his reflection on the screen, </ i>

410
00:46:58,814 --> 00:47:02,913
<i> still laughing at the jokes ... </ i>

411
00:47:03,113 --> 00:47:05,813
<i> she knew by heart. </ i>

412
00:47:09,213 --> 00:47:12,912
<i> If only I had continued
to look at the time ... </ i>

413
00:47:22,811 --> 00:47:25,511
I forwarded
all payment orders.

414
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:32,210
An apple and a banana for you.

415
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:35,610
Go ahead.

416
00:47:35,810 --> 00:47:37,010
No, sir.

417
00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:38,910
I insist.

418
00:47:41,109 --> 00:47:42,009
Okay.

419
00:47:48,709 --> 00:47:50,308
What is that?

420
00:47:51,008 --> 00:47:52,008
A leaf.

421
00:48:01,307 --> 00:48:03,407
Can I have some water,
please?

422
00:48:06,007 --> 00:48:07,607
Then, right?

423
00:48:08,107 --> 00:48:09,206
I love it.

424
00:48:10,106 --> 00:48:11,006
Thank you.

425
00:48:17,506 --> 00:48:20,805
Today, we no longer send
letters. As emails.

426
00:48:21,305 --> 00:48:22,405
More letters?

427
00:48:25,105 --> 00:48:26,605
This is the era of emails.

428
00:48:32,704 --> 00:48:33,904
<i> Hello. </ i>

429
00:48:34,104 --> 00:48:37,003
My mother loves <i>
old serials. </ i>

430
00:48:37,503 --> 00:48:40,603
Small <i>, I watched

431
00:48:41,603 --> 00:48:43,403
<i> I wanted to tell you something. </ i>

432

<i> Each cigarette smoke,
it is 5 min of life and less. </ i>

433
00:48:47,102 --> 00:48:48,902
<i> My father has lung cancer. </ i>

434
00:48:49,302 --> 00:48:54,402
<i> When he suffers too,
he said he would have to smoke more </ i>

435
00:48:54,602 --> 00:48:56,901
<i> for not

436
00:48:57,901 --> 00:48:59,201
<i> Do not blame me. </ i>

437
00:49:48,896 --> 00:49:50,196
Yes, Auntie?

438
00:49:50,596 --> 00:49:52,196
You have my carrots?

439
00:49:52,396 --> 00:49:54,595
They are there.

440
00:49:55,695 --> 00:49:56,795
Here!

441
00:49:59,195 --> 00:50:01,295
They cost only 10 rupees.

442
00:50:01,995 --> 00:50:03,295
What have you taken other?

443
00:50:05,094 --> 00:50:06,894
As usual.

444
00:50:09,094 --> 00:50:13,993
<i> What other food can you cook
based eggplant? </ i>

445
00:50:14,293 --> 00:50:18,293
<i> can fry them, stuff them,
bake ... </ i>

446
00:51:19,087 --> 00:51:20,986
It follows a new treatment.

447
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:25,186
It helps,
but he sleeps all day.

448
00:51:30,385 --> 00:51:32,185
Mom? Where's the TV?

449
00:51:32,685 --> 00:51:35,385
There are currently more good emissions
nowadays.

450
00:51:39,484 --> 00:51:41,884
You need money?

451
00:51:42,284 --> 00:51:44,084
It comes out.

452
00:51:46,284 --> 00:51:48,983
This treatment is very expensive.

453
00:51:49,183 --> 00:51:53,483
It's OK, I got it.

454
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:57,083
But how?
Where do you find the money?

455
00:52:02,182 --> 00:52:05,882
If my son was there,
I would not have to beg.

456
00:52:10,081 --> 00:52:11,881
I'll talk to Rajeev.

457
00:52:12,081 --> 00:52:14,481
It's no go.

458
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:21,180
I ask 5000.

459
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:23,080
It is the family of the bride.

460
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:26,280
What was the air
to ask all this money?

461
00:52:27,879 --> 00:52:31,279
You can pay little by little.

462
00:52:31,479 --> 00:52:32,579
No.

463
00:52:33,879 --> 00:52:35,779
I have money.

464
00:52:38,078 --> 00:52:39,578
I got it.

465
00:52:47,977 --> 00:52:49,177
Well, okay.

466
00:52:50,077 --> 00:52:51,877
But do not tell your father.

467
00:52:52,677 --> 00:52:55,177
The 5000 should be sufficient

468
00:52:55,877 --> 00:52:57,376
for this month.

469
00:52:58,376 --> 00:53:00,576
Next month
else be found.

470
00:53:08,575 --> 00:53:09,775
You wanna see it?

471
00:53:10,675 --> 00:53:11,375
I wake up?

472
00:53:13,575 --> 00:53:15,274
It's late, we must go back.

473
00:53:15,474 --> 00:53:16,474
Okay.

474
00:54:07,269 --> 00:54:08,569
<i> Dear Ila, </ i>

475
00:54:08,769 --> 00:54:11,169

479
00:54:22,867 --> 00:54:25,367
<i> They are all identical. </ i>

480
00:54:26,067 --> 00:54:28,367
<i> But if you look closer, </ i>

481
00:54:29,067 --> 00:54:32,666
<i> we note that each

482

Here <i> a car and more

483
00:54:37,066 --> 00:54:39,066
<i> Or a dog crossing the street. </ i>

484
00:54:39,266 --> 00:54:41,865
<i> What caught the attention of the painter. </ i>

485
00:54:42,365 --> 00:54:43,965
<i> And on one of them, </ i>

486
00:54:44,365 --> 00:54:45,765
<i> I saw. </ i>

487
00:54:47,465 --> 00:54:49,465
<i> At least I think that's me. </ i>

488
00:54:50,865 --> 00:54:53,364
<i> Then I offered

489
00:54:55,064 --> 00:54:57,764

497
00:55:22,061 --> 00:55:23,761
Pardon, sir?

498
00:55:23,961 --> 00:55:26,161
-- What?
-- You told me?

499
00:55:27,161 --> 00:55:27,861
No.

500
00:55:43,459 --> 00:55:44,759
What do you play?

501
00:55:45,259 --> 00:55:46,659
In Blind Man's Bluff.

502
00:55:51,458 --> 00:55:54,358
-- You know what I was playing at your age?
-- What?

503
00:55:56,758 --> 00:55:58,457
Let's remove it first.

504
00:55:58,657 --> 00:56:00,157
I do?

505
00:56:01,057 --> 00:56:02,457
I got it.

506
00:56:07,157 --> 00:56:09,656
We played at home.

507
00:56:13,256 --> 00:56:14,856
That was the baby.

508
00:56:15,356 --> 00:56:16,956
I was the father.

509
00:56:17,256 --> 00:56:22,155
And your uncle was the mother, wife.

510
00:57:14,949 --> 00:57:16,149
<i> Hello. </ i>

00:58:25,342 --> 00:58:26,342
Madame.

521
00:58:52,039 --> 00:58:56,739
<i> if I came to Bhutan with you? </ i>

522
00:58:59,839 --> 00:59:02,338
You seem distracted.

523
00:59:04,738 --> 00:59:07,538
-- I made a mistake?
-- No.

524
00:59:13,137 --> 00:59:14,537
Tell me, Shaikh ...

525
00:59:15,237 --> 00:59:16,137
Yes?

526
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:20,836
-- Have you ever been to Bhutan?
-- Bhutan?

527
00:59:22,536 --> 00:59:26,836
I thought ... rather than Nasik,
I could move there.

528
00:59:28,236 --> 00:59:31,835
I have been in Saudi Arabia.
Bhutan, that's fine too.

529
00:59:32,035 --> 00:59:36,835
It has advantages:
1 rupee is 5 there.

530
00:59:37,835 --> 00:59:39,534
It's worth going there.

531
00:59:42,134 --> 00:59:45,534
My mother said ... she always says:

532
00:59:46,034 --> 00:59:49,333
"The wrong train
can take you to the right station. "

533
00:59:51,733 --> 00:59:53,133
Your mother?

534
00:59:57,833 --> 00:59:59,532
You told me that you were an orphan.

535
00:59:59,732 --> 01:00:01,132
This is true,

536
01:00:01,332 --> 01:00:03,632
but when I say:
"My mother always says ..."

537
01:00:03,832 --> 01:00:07,132
people take me seriously.
It feels good.

538
01:00:14,731 --> 01:00:15,631
That is correct.

539
01:00:27,429 --> 01:00:30,329
You're listening to Radio <i> Bhutan ... </ i>

540
01:01:03,226 --> 01:01:05,725
<i> How could we go together
Bhutan? </ i>

541
01:01:06,025 --> 01:01:08,025
<i> I do not even know your name. </ i>

542
01:01:21,024 --> 01:01:22,324
How are you?

543
01:01:31,123 --> 01:01:32,623
A banana and an apple.

544
01:01:35,022 --> 01:01:36,422
Try this.

545
01:01:39,922 --> 01:01:42,522
You are radiant today.

546
01:01:42,722 --> 01:01:44,621
Whether he comes?

547
01:01:48,221 --> 01:01:50,721
You lost 10 years.

548
01:01:59,620 --> 01:02:05,919
Your mother said that the wrong train
can take you to the right station ...

549
01:02:07,719 --> 01:02:09,719
-- My mother is always right.
-- So?

550
01:02:10,419 --> 01:02:11,619
I love it.

551
01:02:12,418 --> 01:02:13,618
Variety.

552
01:02:13,818 --> 01:02:15,118
Variety, sir.

553
01:02:29,617 --> 01:02:30,917
Auntie!

554
01:02:35,616 --> 01:02:37,116
What does he?

555
01:02:40,816 --> 01:02:43,415
Would you have the cassette of this film,
"Saajan"?

556
01:02:43,615 --> 01:02:46,115
So, why?

557
01:02:47,415 --> 01:02:49,715
The songs were good, right?

558
01:02:51,014 --> 01:02:52,114
Not bad.

559
01:02:55,714 --> 01:02:57,314
We can hear it?

560
01:02:58,214 --> 01:02:59,314
Now?

561
01:03:01,013 --> 01:03:01,913
Yes.

562
01:03:02,513 --> 01:03:04,113
You can put it?

563
01:03:05,413 --> 01:03:06,813
I put it.

564
01:04:12,406 --> 01:04:13,506
<i> Hello, </ i>

565
01:04:14,306 --> 01:04:19,105
<i> Yesterday Auntie put the cassette
Film "Saajan". Funny coincidence. </ I>

566
01:04:20,005 --> 01:04:22,805
<i> She tapes

567
01:04:23,005 --> 01:04:25,705

568
01:04:26,305 --> 01:04:29,204
<i> It keeps the industry alive

569
01:04:29,904 --> 01:04:34,404
<i> I crossed
few lines of this letter ... </ i>

570
01:04:36,403 --> 01:04:39,203
It's weird <i>
to continue to write, right? </ i>

571
01:04:39,803 --> 01:04:43,203
<i> can write everything in a letter,

572
01:04:44,203 --> 01:04:47,902
<i> But what I erased,

573
01:04:49,202 --> 01:04:51,802
<i> It is time we meet. </ i>

574
01:04:53,102 --> 01:04:57,001
<i> Do you know the coffee Kooler
in Matunga? </ i>

575
01:04:57,901 --> 01:05:00,401
It seems they are <i>
a very good "kheema pao", </ i>

576
01:05:01,201 --> 01:05:02,301
<i> my favorite dish. </ i>

577
01:05:02,601 --> 01:05:05,400
<i> What say you of an appointment

578
01:06:01,195 --> 01:06:02,395
Mr. Saajan ...

579
01:06:03,294 --> 01:06:04,094
What?

580
01:06:04,294 --> 01:06:05,894
The boss wants to see you.

581
01:06:06,694 --> 01:06:09,794
-- Yes, I will go after lunch.
-- This is urgent.

582
01:06:11,394 --> 01:06:12,493
I'm coming.

583
01:06:28,692 --> 01:06:29,592
Can I enter?

584
01:06:47,290 --> 01:06:50,290
I just had a meeting
with accounting.

585
01:06:50,789 --> 01:06:53,689
I've never been
so embarrassed in my life.

586
01:06:55,089 --> 01:06:56,889
Do you know what they said?

587
01:06:57,989 --> 01:07:02,388
It is as if our service
claims did not exist.

588
01:07:05,188 --> 01:07:07,088
All payment orders are wrong!

589
01:07:07,288 --> 01:07:10,187
Shaikh initials are everywhere.

590
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:14,287
The idea that I would leave
replace you!

591
01:07:18,087 --> 01:07:20,186
Should you review all of this.

592
01:07:21,186 --> 01:07:23,486
Spend the night if necessary,
but correct me that.

593
01:07:24,586 --> 01:07:27,286
In your case, Shaikh,
out of my sight.

594
01:07:27,486 --> 01:07:29,185
It's my fault, sir.

595
01:07:30,285 --> 01:07:32,685
It is I who
payment orders.

596
01:07:33,285 --> 01:07:35,985
He has initialed
because we work together.

597
01:07:36,785 --> 01:07:38,285
It's my fault.

598
01:07:38,584 --> 01:07:40,884
Fernandes,
you do not have to defend it.

599
01:07:41,184 --> 01:07:42,884
I am not defending anyone, sir.

600
01:07:45,784 --> 01:07:47,684
35 years of service,

601
01:07:48,083 --> 01:07:50,383
and you have never done
the slightest mistake.

602
01:07:51,483 --> 01:07:54,183
It's not my type
defend anyone.

603
01:07:56,783 --> 01:07:58,182
Anyway,

604
01:07:59,782 --> 01:08:02,082
I take care of the accounting.

605
01:08:02,682 --> 01:08:04,182
Okay, sir.

606
01:08:08,381 --> 01:08:09,881
One last thing.

607
01:08:10,981 --> 01:08:13,281
Why these files
they have the smell of vegetables?

608
01:08:15,281 --> 01:08:17,880
Onions, potatoes, even garlic!

609
01:08:18,180 --> 01:08:18,980
Really?

610
01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:21,080
Feel!

611
01:08:23,580 --> 01:08:24,880
I do not know.

612
01:08:46,877 --> 01:08:48,677
Pardon, sir.

613
01:08:52,977 --> 01:08:53,877
Thank you.
You saved me.

614
01:08:54,177 --> 01:08:57,676
Do not cut ever
those pesky vegetables on folders.

615
01:08:58,976 --> 01:09:00,076
Forgiveness.

616
01:09:03,276 --> 01:09:06,675
I put a plastic bag,
next time.

617
01:09:10,075 --> 01:09:14,075
Okay, no vegetables. Nothing. Forgiveness.

618
01:09:16,874 --> 01:09:19,074
This is not the accounts
a shabby little restaurant!

619
01:09:19,374 --> 01:09:21,374
These public accounts!

620
01:09:27,373 --> 01:09:29,573
If you do not do that, go!

621
01:09:30,473 --> 01:09:31,673
From?

622
01:09:31,973 --> 01:09:32,973
No.

623
01:09:34,272 --> 01:09:35,872
You teach me everything.

624
01:09:36,972 --> 01:09:39,472
I'm sorry,
but you teach me everything.

625
01:09:43,971 --> 01:09:46,571
Your mother told you
to make fake degrees

626
01:09:46,771 --> 01:09:48,371
to get a job?

627
01:09:51,071 --> 01:09:53,470
It must have been mistaken ...

628
01:09:56,270 --> 01:09:58,570
What kind of person are you?

629
01:10:05,669 --> 01:10:08,869
And if you come home for lunch?

630
01:10:09,569 --> 01:10:11,369
I prepared a "Pasanda".

631
01:10:19,468 --> 01:10:21,867
Amazing! Mr. Shaikh.

632
01:10:23,867 --> 01:10:25,367
Amazing ...

633
01:10:29,867 --> 01:10:31,266
A "Pasanda" he said.

634
01:10:35,566 --> 01:10:37,366
You come from, is not it?

635
01:10:39,766 --> 01:10:41,565
-- Take--in.
-- No.

636
01:10:43,365 --> 01:10:44,465
This is very good.

637
01:10:44,665 --> 01:10:46,265
This is my recipe.

638
01:10:46,465 --> 01:10:47,765
My father warned me:

639
01:10:47,965 --> 01:10:50,564
"Do not marry this guy,
it will chain you to the stove. "

640
01:10:50,764 --> 01:10:52,964
His father is a very dangerous man.

641
01:10:53,164 --> 01:10:57,964
He did not smile
since the World Cup 1984.

642
01:10:58,164 --> 01:11:00,663
Or maybe just a little.

643
01:11:02,863 --> 01:11:04,863
Still grinning.

644
01:11:09,562 --> 01:11:11,462
What does your wife?

645
01:11:11,662 --> 01:11:13,062
Shh.

646
01:11:13,662 --> 01:11:15,362
I'm sorry, she did not know.

647
01:11:15,562 --> 01:11:17,062
Okay.

648
01:11:18,162 --> 01:11:21,861
My wife is dead.

649
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:33,860
But I have a girlfriend.

650
01:11:35,260 --> 01:11:36,260
You?

651
01:11:38,559 --> 01:11:39,759
Yes.

652
01:11:46,659 --> 01:11:48,458
How is it called?

653
01:12:00,457 --> 01:12:01,657
Ila.

654
01:12:04,957 --> 01:12:09,456
I knew it!
Meals, notes ...

655
01:12:09,956 --> 01:12:11,556
When were you married?

656
01:12:11,756 --> 01:12:16,256
Marriage ... it sometimes seems
it's been 35 years.

657
01:12:17,055 --> 01:12:21,055
Or 25 or 10, but I sometimes
feel like it was yesterday.

658
01:12:24,055 --> 01:12:26,654
You back for seconds.

659
01:12:28,554 --> 01:12:30,154
This is my recipe.

660
01:12:31,754 --> 01:12:33,154
You do not eat anything at all.

661
01:12:37,753 --> 01:12:40,253
I wanted to ask you something.

662
01:12:40,553 --> 01:12:42,053
Go ahead.

663
01:12:44,353 --> 01:12:47,452
About our marriage ...

664
01:12:50,752 --> 01:12:53,752
In fact, his father refused.

665
01:12:54,852 --> 01:12:58,751
He said: "He is an orphan, small,
he skinned. "

666
01:13:02,551 --> 01:13:07,050
Meherunissa then fled.

667
01:13:10,550 --> 01:13:15,049
But she wants the blessing
his father.

668
01:13:17,249 --> 01:13:18,749
I will not tell anyone.

669
01:13:18,949 --> 01:13:20,649
No, that's not it.

670
01:13:20,949 --> 01:13:23,049
He agreed.

671
01:13:24,548 --> 01:13:26,048
We're getting married.

672
01:13:31,748 --> 01:13:37,647
There will be a whole army on his side:
brothers and sisters, uncles and aunts ...

673
01:13:38,447 --> 01:13:42,047
everyone will be there.

674
01:13:42,747 --> 01:13:45,646
But there will be no one on my side.

675
01:13:47,746 --> 01:13:49,446
I am alone.

676
01:13:50,446 --> 01:13:52,745
I wanted to know if you would ...

677
01:13:54,945 --> 01:13:58,945
to be my witness.

678
01:14:00,645 --> 01:14:01,445
Me?

679
01:14:02,144 --> 01:14:04,544
Yes. And if Ms. Ila could come too.

680
01:14:09,144 --> 01:14:10,344
Course.

681
01:14:13,943 --> 01:14:15,043
We will come.

682
01:14:18,643 --> 01:14:20,743
His father wants to offer me a scooter.

683
01:14:21,242 --> 01:14:23,042
A gift for my promotion.

684
01:14:24,042 --> 01:14:25,642
But I'm not leaving.

685
01:14:28,142 --> 01:14:31,441
I thought refuse
early departure retirement.

686
01:14:33,541 --> 01:14:37,241
I ask the boss
you become my assistant.

687
01:14:37,841 --> 01:14:39,041
So your promotion ...

688
01:14:42,140 --> 01:14:46,640
This is very good news,
Sir!

689
01:14:50,139 --> 01:14:53,239
But not a word to my father,
otherwise no scooter.

690
01:14:55,839 --> 01:14:58,739
I'll tell Meherunissa.

691
01:16:29,229 --> 01:16:31,229
Sir, you want to sit?

692
01:16:31,429 --> 01:16:32,429
Me?

693
01:16:33,029 --> 01:16:34,629
Yes, take my place.

694
01:16:34,829 --> 01:16:35,828
No.

695
01:16:36,728 --> 01:16:39,028
Please.
I go down to the next.

696
01:17:06,125 --> 01:17:07,725
-- Fernandes.
-- Yes?

697
01:17:07,925 --> 01:17:09,425
You wanted to talk to me?

698
01:17:10,425 --> 01:17:11,425
No.

699
01:17:12,025 --> 01:17:14,124
My secretary told me ...

700
01:17:14,924 --> 01:17:17,024
It was about payment orders.

701
01:17:17,924 --> 01:17:19,324
What is it?

702
01:17:20,224 --> 01:17:21,524
This is resolved.

703
01:17:21,924 --> 01:17:23,523
-- Are you sure?
-- Yes.

704
01:17:25,523 --> 01:17:27,823
Okay. See you later.

705
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:56,720
Want to Buy?

706
01:19:43,309 --> 01:19:44,409
<i> Dear Ila, </ i>

707
01:19:44,909 --> 01:19:47,608
<i> I got the lunchbox today
but it was empty. </ i>

708
01:19:47,908 --> 01:19:50,208
<i> It was deserved. </ i>

709
01:19:51,808 --> 01:19:55,508
<i> Yesterday you me long
waited at the restaurant ... </ i>

710
01:19:56,108 --> 01:19:58,807
<i> But before that, in the morning, </ i>

711
01:19:59,007 --> 01:20:02,207
<i> I forgot something
in the bathroom. </ i>

712
01:20:03,407 --> 01:20:05,007
<i> I went back ... </ i>

713
01:20:06,407 --> 01:20:08,206
<i> and the room had the same smell </ i>

714
01:20:08,406 --> 01:20:10,406
<i> that my grandfather left there </ i>

715
01:20:10,706 --> 01:20:12,306
<i> after his shower. </ i>

716
01:20:15,106 --> 01:20:17,205
<i> It was like he had been there. </ i>

717
01:20:18,305 --> 01:20:19,805
<i> But that was not the case. </ i>

718
01:20:20,105 --> 01:20:21,505
<i> That was me. </ i>

719
01:20:22,505 --> 01:20:25,205
<i> Me and the smell of an old man. </ i>

720
01:20:27,004 --> 01:20:29,304
<i> I do not know
when I became old. </ i>

721
01:20:29,504 --> 01:20:34,304
<i> It was perhaps this morning.
Or before. </ I>

722
01:20:35,503 --> 01:20:38,203
<i> And maybe if I'd forgotten
something earlier, </ i>

723
01:20:38,503 --> 01:20:40,303
<i> I would then noticed. </ i>

724
01:20:41,303 --> 01:20:43,203
Sir, you want to sit?

725
01:20:43,903 --> 01:20:44,803
No.

726
01:20:47,902 --> 01:20:51,002
<i> life rocked me languidly, </ i>

727
01:20:52,102 --> 01:20:55,101
<i> forward, back ... </ i>

728
01:20:56,001 --> 01:20:58,001
<i> And before I knew it ... </ i>

729
01:20:59,301 --> 01:21:02,401
<i> Nobody buys
a lottery ticket expired, Ila. </ i>

730
01:21:03,601 --> 01:21:06,100
<i> I came to the restaurant. </ i>

731
01:21:08,300 --> 01:21:09,700
<i> And you were there, </ i>

732
01:21:09,900 --> 01:21:11,700
<i> fiddling with your purse, </ i>

733
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:14,099
<i> to drink all that water ... </ i>

734
01:21:22,399 --> 01:21:24,798
I wanted to come <i>
tell you all this in the face, </ i>

735
01:21:24,998 --> 01:21:27,098
<i> but I only look at you. </ i>

736
01:21:31,598 --> 01:21:33,197
<i> You were lovely. </ i>

737
01:21:37,697 --> 01:21:38,997
<i> You are young. </ i>

738
01:21:39,697 --> 01:21:41,397
<i> You still have dreams. </ i>

739
01:21:43,396 --> 01:21:45,196
<i> You have greeted me some time. </ i>

740
01:21:48,896 --> 01:21:51,096
<i> And I want to thank you. </ i>

741
01:22:30,791 --> 01:22:34,391
The two ladies behind
come forward, please.

742
01:22:37,691 --> 01:22:39,091
Smile, please.

743
01:22:39,691 --> 01:22:41,490
One, two, three.

744
01:22:42,390 --> 01:22:43,890
Now a photo
with everyone!

745
01:22:44,090 --> 01:22:47,090
The family of the bride to the right.
The spouse left.

746
01:22:54,889 --> 01:22:57,589
The spouse left.

747
01:23:15,687 --> 01:23:17,087
You leave, sir?

748
01:23:18,786 --> 01:23:21,986
-- This is the new scooter?
-- I will drop you somewhere?

749
01:23:23,586 --> 01:23:27,086
If you stay,
I will go to my father.

750
01:23:29,885 --> 01:23:30,985
Taxi!

751
01:23:32,985 --> 01:23:36,885
It's weird, it is very dry ...

752
01:23:48,683 --> 01:23:49,983
Goodbye, Shaikh.

753
01:23:55,483 --> 01:23:56,882
You know,

754
01:23:57,482 --> 01:24:00,882
when I took the train for the 1st time
with you, 1st class.

755
01:24:01,782 --> 01:24:03,482
That day, I had no ticket.

756
01:24:05,082 --> 01:24:07,681
I was anxious throughout the journey.

757
01:24:08,281 --> 01:24:10,181
I prayed that the controller
does not come.

758
01:24:10,381 --> 01:24:12,081
What would you think of me?

759
01:24:16,680 --> 01:24:19,980
The next day, I got to
a 1st class pass.

760
01:24:34,379 --> 01:24:36,378
You make a good husband, Shaikh.

761
01:24:38,178 --> 01:24:39,378
Thank you.

762
01:24:47,877 --> 01:24:49,077
A moment.

763
01:24:56,576 --> 01:24:58,576
Come see me at Nasik, on occasion.

764
01:25:46,871 --> 01:25:50,171
I'm coming, Mom.

765
01:26:06,669 --> 01:26:08,069
80 rupees.

766
01:26:36,066 --> 01:26:37,766
Rajeev comes.

767
01:26:38,866 --> 01:26:40,565
It is in a meeting.

768
01:26:41,065 --> 01:26:43,265
It will go directly to the crematorium.

769
01:26:50,664 --> 01:26:52,964
I have one of these hungers.

770
01:26:54,864 --> 01:26:57,064
A desire to "parathas".

771
01:27:01,263 --> 01:27:03,763
I have not eaten this morning.

772
01:27:04,863 --> 01:27:07,163
I prepared his breakfast it.

773
01:27:07,363 --> 01:27:08,463
Mom ...

774
01:27:13,462 --> 01:27:15,962
I always apprehended

775
01:27:17,662 --> 01:27:20,561
what would happen to me after his death.

776
01:27:23,061 --> 01:27:24,561
-- Do not worry.
-- But now ...

777
01:27:26,861 --> 01:27:29,160
I'm hungry, that's all.

778
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:40,859
It was loved at first

779
01:27:42,159 --> 01:27:43,859
when you were born.

780
01:27:47,758 --> 01:27:52,658
But for years,
it disgusted me.

781
01:27:55,658 --> 01:27:59,057
Every morning, I prepared something to eat.

782
01:27:59,257 --> 01:28:01,557
Drugs. Bath.

783
01:28:01,957 --> 01:28:04,057
Breakfast. Drugs.

784
01:28:04,257 --> 01:28:05,557
Bath.

785
01:28:15,256 --> 01:28:17,855
When your brother is dead,

786
01:28:20,455 --> 01:28:23,055
this old ambulance came.

787
01:28:23,555 --> 01:28:24,955
Do you remember?

788
01:28:28,254 --> 01:28:30,554
These old Matador models.

789
01:28:31,554 --> 01:28:33,654
Which came today?

790
01:28:35,853 --> 01:28:37,653
What color?

791
01:28:39,053 --> 01:28:42,253
White with blue light.

792
01:28:43,253 --> 01:28:44,053
Yes.

793
01:29:03,651 --> 01:29:04,750
Sir.

794
01:29:06,850 --> 01:29:09,650
The lunchbox comes
to the wrong address.

795
01:29:09,850 --> 01:29:11,650
It is impossible.

796
01:29:12,450 --> 01:29:16,649
-- We never make mistakes.
-- Yes, I understand.

797
01:29:16,849 --> 01:29:22,249
But my meals are poorly delivered.

798
01:29:22,449 --> 01:29:24,348
-- It is delivered to the right address.
-- I tell you no.

799
01:29:24,548 --> 01:29:26,148
People came to Harvard.

800
01:29:26,348 --> 01:29:27,548
Listen to what I tell you.

801
01:29:28,348 --> 01:29:30,548
Try to understand.

802
01:29:31,448 --> 01:29:34,847
This lunchbox is not delivered to my husband.

803
01:29:35,047 --> 01:29:38,547
It comes also
it is someone else who receives it.

804
01:29:39,047 --> 01:29:42,346
People Harvard
came to study our system.

805
01:29:42,546 --> 01:29:44,846
They say that there is no error.

806
01:29:45,046 --> 01:29:46,546
But it's not going to the right place.

807
01:29:46,846 --> 01:29:48,346
You think I'm a liar?

808
01:29:48,646 --> 01:29:52,145
The King of England in person
came to observe our system.

809
01:29:52,445 --> 01:29:55,145
But this meal goes somewhere
someone eats it.

810
01:29:55,345 --> 01:29:56,645
He goes to the right place.

811
01:29:56,845 --> 01:29:59,645
I want the address!

812
01:30:24,542 --> 01:30:25,842
Office Saajan Fernandes?

813
01:30:26,042 --> 01:30:28,842
Two rows away.

814
01:30:39,341 --> 01:30:42,340
Is the office Saajan Fernandes?

815
01:30:43,940 --> 01:30:45,140
I remember you.

816
01:30:45,340 --> 01:30:47,040
Saajan Fernandes?

817
01:30:47,240 --> 01:30:48,740
He is gone.

818
01:30:49,439 --> 01:30:52,239
He left the company.

819
01:30:52,939 --> 01:30:54,239
Where can I find it?

820
01:30:56,939 --> 01:30:58,339
He went to Nasik.

821
01:31:07,338 --> 01:31:09,337
Then you go to Nasik?

822
01:31:09,637 --> 01:31:10,537
Yes.

823
01:31:12,537 --> 01:31:14,437
You move?

824
01:31:16,337 --> 01:31:17,537
Yes.

825
01:31:18,236 --> 01:31:19,836
This is final?

826
01:31:21,536 --> 01:31:22,536
Yes.

827
01:31:26,536 --> 01:31:29,335
I'm retired there for years.

828
01:31:29,535 --> 01:31:32,235
I return to Mumbai from time to time
to see my son.

829
01:32:11,331 --> 01:32:12,431
I'm sorry, Mrs. Ila.

830
01:32:57,426 --> 01:32:58,726
Good evening, Mr. Fernandes.

831
01:32:58,926 --> 01:33:00,326
We thought you were gone.

832
01:33:00,626 --> 01:33:03,026
Yes, but I came back.

833
01:33:03,226 --> 01:33:04,225
Why?

834
01:33:12,725 --> 01:33:15,524
Well, you can play here.

835
01:33:15,824 --> 01:33:18,524
But do not break windows,
understood?

836
01:33:19,424 --> 01:33:20,324
Hold.

837
01:33:22,424 --> 01:33:23,323
Thank you, Mr. Fernandes.

838
01:33:49,221 --> 01:33:51,520
I've been calling you all the time.

839
01:33:52,420 --> 01:33:54,020
Where were you?

840
01:33:54,220 --> 01:33:56,220
I had to adjust something.

841
01:33:56,820 --> 01:33:58,520
I got worried.

842
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:03,719
I have more layers to Tonton.

843
01:34:04,419 --> 01:34:06,419
I asked the guard to search.

844
01:34:08,819 --> 01:34:11,218
I washed the fan today.

845
01:34:12,418 --> 01:34:14,518
While he was running!

846
01:36:02,407 --> 01:36:04,307
<i> You're probably Nasik. </ i>

847
01:36:05,207 --> 01:36:07,806
<i> You had to get up this morning
make a tea. </ i>

848
01:36:10,006 --> 01:36:12,106
<i> And maybe a walk then. </ i>

849
01:36:14,406 --> 01:36:18,305
<i> This morning I woke up,
and I sold all my jewelry. </ i>

850
01:36:19,205 --> 01:36:22,805
<i> My bracelets, my earrings,
my wedding necklace. </ i>

851
01:36:23,205 --> 01:36:24,805
<i> It is not much. </ i>

852
01:36:25,004 --> 01:36:29,104
<i> But they told me:
1 rupee is worth 5 in Bhutan. </ I>

853
01:36:29,604 --> 01:36:31,804
So we should <i>
get away for some time. </ i>

854
01:36:32,004 --> 01:36:33,404
<i> And more ... </ i>

855
01:36:35,003 --> 01:36:37,303
<i> we'll see. </ i>

856
01:36:38,703 --> 01:36:41,903
<i> return Yashvi,
luggage will be ready. </ i>

857
01:36:42,103 --> 01:36:44,202
<i> We take the train this afternoon. </ i>

858
01:36:45,202 --> 01:36:47,602
<i> I may send you this letter </ i>

859
01:36:47,802 --> 01:36:50,302
<i> and your new factor
you bring. </ i>

860
01:36:51,002 --> 01:36:53,502
<i> Or maybe I should keep it, </ i>

861
01:36:54,401 --> 01:36:56,801
<i> and read in a few years ... </ i>

862
01:36:58,401 --> 01:37:00,001
<i> I read somewhere that sometimes, </ i>

863
01:37:01,301 --> 01:37:04,200
<i> the wrong train
can lead you to the right station. </ i>

864
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:07,100
<i> We'll see ... </ i>
