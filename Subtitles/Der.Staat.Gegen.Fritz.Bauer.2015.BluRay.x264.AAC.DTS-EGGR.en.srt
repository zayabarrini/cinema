1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:06,000
-=THE LAST FANTASY=-

2
00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:25,463
Today, Germany is proud of its economic miracle.

3
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:31,416
It is also proud to be the home of Goethe and Beethoven.

4
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:35,797
But Germany is also the country of Hitler, Eichmann

5
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:40,047
and their many accomplices and followers.

6
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:44,920
But as the day consists of day and night

7
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:51,379
The history of every people has its light and dark sides.

8
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:57,919
I believe that the young generation in Germany is ready

9
00:00:58,583 --> 00:01:02,885
to know the whole story, the whole truth

10
00:01:03,416 --> 00:01:09,378
which, however, is sometimes difficult for her parents to cope with.

11
00:01:16,958 --> 00:01:20,715
Dr. Bauer?

12
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,168
I'm bringing your groceries, Doctor.

13
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:32,337
Should I clear up?

14
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:36,583
...is German merchant shipping. But also air freight transport...

15
00:01:58,866 --> 00:02:03,464
Your car will be ready tomorrow from 7 a.m. If you need me earlier, let me know.

16
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:08,379
Have a nice evening, Doctor.

17
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:15,250
Doctor?

18
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:23,422
Doctor?

19
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:25,630
Doctor

20
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:27,635
Doctor!

21
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:31,302
Doctor!

22
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:35,093
Help! Help, we need help!

23
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:54,797
We examined the crime scene, but it does not look like an assassination attempt.

24
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:59,510
It seems that the general had consumed an unfortunate mixture of alcohol and sleeping pills.

25
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:04,302
- Sleeping pills? How many sleeping pills? - Two or three are missing.

26
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:07,489
If there were more, one might think the general wanted to kill himself.

27
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,169
One might think he is overwhelmed.

28
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:13,426
- True. - Examine the apartment thoroughly.

29
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:21,837
Kreidler?

30
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:24,877
Federal Criminal Police Office.

31
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,795
- Kreidler? - Good evening, Chief Public Prosecutor.

32
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:33,921
Your supervisor almost died today.

33
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:37,793
- An assassination attempt? - No.

34
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:41,923
One could interpret it as a kind of suicide attempt.

35
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:45,717
What incident is he in?

36
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:48,211
He's getting back on his feet.

37
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:53,466
But the question is whether and for how long can we even afford such an Attorney General?

38
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:58,052
I mean, a little more pressure and the man would be, his place would be free.

39
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,051
Thank you, Gebhardt.

40
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:05,843
- You're welcome. Have a nice evening. - I'll have one.

41
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:25,052
We continue our conversation with Mr. Eichmann on the Jewish question.

42
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:29,588
I'd be interested to know how the situation with the Jews would have turned out in the best case scenario, in your opinion, Mr. Eichmann?

43
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:33,504
I tell you quite honestly, Comrade Sassen,

44
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:38,627
we had exterminated 10.3 million of the 10.3 million Jews,

45
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:46,169
I would be satisfied and say: "Well, we have destroyed an enemy.

46
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:50,593
Our task for our blood, our people,

47
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:54,418
We would then have fulfilled the freedom of the peoples.

48
00:04:54,958 --> 00:05:01,334
I was also to blame for the fact that the elimination of our enemy, which I had conceived,

49
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:04,552
could not be fully implemented.

50
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:08,672
I was an inadequate mind.

51
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:10,926
That is my fault.

52
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:15,466
In truth, I could and should have done more.

53
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:24,672
Good afternoon, Attorney General.

54
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:34,419
I don't want to talk about it. But thank you.

55
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:50,712
Fritz!

56
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:56,136
- Mr. Prime Minister, what an honor. - I wanted to visit you.

57
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:59,919
Oh, that's nice of you. But it's hardly worth mentioning.

58
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,051
You could have called.

59
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:05,508
Sit down, we need to talk.

60
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:13,542
Leave us alone for a moment, please?

61
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:20,460
There are rumors, Fritz.

62
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:24,134
What kind of rumors?

63
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:28,885
That you tried to take your own life.

64
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:34,502
I haven't been able to sleep without chemicals for a long time.

65
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:39,339
As your employer, I cannot ignore such rumors.

66
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:42,465
I have a gun.

67
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:47,672
If I want to kill myself, there are no rumors.

68
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:14,668
Dr. Bauer! How nice to see you well! I heard about your mishap.

69
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:19,927
Don't worry, Kreidler, I'm fine.

70
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:23,878
Are you sure? You look pale. Some fresh air would do you good.

71
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:27,757
Yes, you are actually right.

72
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:31,927
Would you like to visit me at my country house? Are you interested in hunting?

73
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:35,672
Yes, but not on animals.

74
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:58,342
Was someone in my room?

75
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:02,417
- Not that I know of. Is something missing again? - The Schneider file.

76
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:05,334
Please gather all prosecutors.

77
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:06,922
Now?

78
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,751
I just need the special department heads.

79
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:50,801
Please.

80
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:55,042
- Good day. - Good evening, gentlemen. Please.

81
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:58,754
- Thank you very much. - Dr. Bauer.

82
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:08,259
Yes, thank you for coming to this late meeting. As you know, I've been unwell for a few days.

83
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:12,464
Who wants a cigar?

84
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:15,545
- No thanks. - Thank you.

85
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:18,425
No thanks, absolutely not.

86
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:21,053
Gut.

87
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:30,754
What is the search for Bormann and Mengele doing?

88
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:33,584
There's nothing new.

89
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:39,543
- The search for Eichmann? - Unfortunately, I have nothing new to report, Doctor Bauer.

90
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:42,678
Mr. KÃ¼gler, Mr. Vogel, do you have something to report?

91
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:47,505
- Well, uh - We've been busy with a few other cases over the last few days.

92
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:51,044
There is no decisive development.

93
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,339
How could it be? You were only unwell for a week.

94
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:58,546
Yes, what could possibly happen?

95
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:03,510
if nothing happened in the twelve years after the war?

96
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:08,297
Well, then thank you.

97
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:13,295
With all due respect, Dr. Bauer, was that all?

98
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:19,442
- What do you mean? - Shouldn't the meeting have been held until Monday?

99
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:22,678
Sorry to disturb your domestic happiness.

100
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:28,879
I don't think I have to apologize for planning to spend some time with my young children on Friday nights.

101
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:32,462
And I don't think you have to apologize to me for anything.

102
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:37,543
While I was away, another file disappeared from my office.

103
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:43,592
This time it's that of SS commander Schneider, who today works comfortably at Mercedes-Benz.

104
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:47,590
My own agency is enemy territory

105
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:50,715
and nothing is moving forward here at all.

106
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:07,377
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

107
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:09,837
Goodbye.

108
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:16,127
Dr. Bauer?

109
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,834
I have the Schneider file.

110
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:27,922
- You have them? - Yes. You asked me last week for my assessment of the evidence presented against Schneider.

111
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,780
Why didn't you just say that?

112
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,461
I didn't mean to embarrass you.

113
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:43,044
That makes you a rare exception, Angermann. Thank you.

114
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,462
Good evening.

115
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:59,866
Please contact me at Copenhagen. The Tiefenthal family.

116
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,759
- Tiefenthal, good evening. - Hello, Walter. - Hello?

117
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:09,582
This is Fritz. Am I disturbing you?

118
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:13,252
Fritz? Hello! How are you? Margot, your brother

119
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:16,884
- Thank you. Thank you, very good. And you? - Everything's great.

120
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:19,591
- Hey, here she comes. - Fritz, how beautiful!

121
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:21,919
Margot, my love.

122
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:26,712
Am I disturbing you? I just wanted to hear your voice.

123
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:30,345
Why? What's going on? Have you received death threats again?

124
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,131
No, no. Everything's fine.

125
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:39,460
I might be able to make it to Copenhagen for your birthday after all.

126
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:42,511
Oh, that would be nice. We would be delighted.

127
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:46,751
Should I invite your wife? Then we'd all be together.

128
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:51,219
Yes, yes, go ahead and invite her if you want. I'd be happy.

129
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:56,088
Um, I have to get back to work now, Margot.

130
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:58,843
Goodbye.

131
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:22,552
Good day.

132
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,883
- Three oranges. - With pleasure.

133
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:39,011
Nick?

134
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:48,047
- Where is Nick? - He wanted to go swimming with a girl.

135
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:52,168
- What's there to grin about? - I think he likes her.

136
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:55,169
The main thing is that he doesn't bring them with him.

137
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,463
See you in the morning.

138
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:08,463
Hello! Is there anything left to eat?

139
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:14,587
What is?

140
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:26,133
Oh, good morning, Dr. Bauer. I thought you were already in Copenhagen.

141
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:30,920
I'm going to the airport now. I just brought some work with me.

142
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:34,088
Why not use these few days to relax?

143
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:40,254
I would be the first to be able to relax at a family celebration.

144
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,965
- Good morning. - Thank you. - With pleasure.

145
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:53,047
Oh, this one seems to be private.

146
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:18,879
Dear Mr. Bauer: I have started to present this letter to you today, so this is done in the hope

147
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:24,127
that you help me in catching a man wanted for multiple murders.

148
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:25,756
Dr. Bauer, it's for you.

149
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:29,877
I have reason to believe that Adolf Eichmann

150
00:16:30,308 --> 00:16:35,627
- Dr. Bauer? - is staying in a suburb of Buenos Aires under a false name.

151
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:41,668
My daughter Silvia fell in love with Eichmann's eldest son Nick.

152
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:47,542
In the Argentine newspaper, I could only read that your agency is following the Eichmann case.

153
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:49,468
Adolf Eichmann

154
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:54,384
was responsible for the transport of millions of Jews from all over Europe

155
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:56,877
in large camps where they were murdered.

156
00:16:57,208 --> 00:17:00,337
If you are interested in my information,

157
00:17:00,366 --> 00:17:02,883
I would be very pleased to receive an answer from you

158
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:06,501
Yours sincerely, Hermann.

159
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:22,212
Please cancel my flight to Copenhagen and connect me with my sister.

160
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:25,797
Hello, can you hear me?

161
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,217
- Fritz! - Rosa Luxemburg?

162
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:44,340
You're pretty daring. What does the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution say about this?

163
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:48,464
- They're probably still investigating who the picture is. Come in. - Thanks.

164
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:51,255
Sit down.

165
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:53,547
Thanks.

166
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:55,916
Brandy?

167
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,004
No thanks.

168
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:03,542
A man named Lothar Hermann

169
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:09,876
believes he has discovered Adolf Eichmann in Argentina.

170
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:13,042
ObersturmbandfÃ¼hrer of the SS,

171
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:17,417
Head of Department IV, B4 in the Reich Security Main Office

172
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:21,761
responsible for the "resettlement" of the Jews.

173
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:31,293
The investigation file was created in 1945.

174
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,881
Hmm. And what do you want to do now?

175
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:38,542
Bring him to trial in Germany.

176
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:41,217
Well, good.

177
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,752
But I don't know how.

178
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,045
I just don't know how.

179
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:52,631
- Your holy anger is good. It keeps you young. - No!

180
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:57,589
My anger is accompanied by powerlessness. And that ages me!

181
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:01,214
Undoubtedly. What have I achieved?

182
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:07,677
One can no longer insult Hitler's assassins as traitors, fine. But otherwise? Nothing!

183
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:10,589
All investigations are stuck.

184
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:16,252
You know, after '45, I really thought we had defeated evil.

185
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:20,294
I thought we could now establish a new society:

186
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:24,091
free, just, brotherly.

187
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:27,928
But people don't want any visions.

188
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:33,418
They want to buy a pleasant single-family home and a small car.

189
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:37,217
They want Adenauer's damned reconciliation!

190
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:43,044
The restoration has once again defeated the revolution, as has happened so often in Germany.

191
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:45,916
I can't breathe in here!

192
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:55,627
You knew it wouldn't be easy.

193
00:19:56,583 --> 00:20:01,797
Eichmann, that would be a blow. He's the central figure.

194
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,083
The organizer of the Final Solution.

195
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,923
All the threads converge with him.

196
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:13,251
Do you know how many people would lose sleep at night if we put him in the dock in Frankfurt?

197
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:16,464
I tried to contact Interpol

198
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:21,303
but they say they are not responsible for political crimes.

199
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:26,466
There is no investigative authority that is not riddled with National Socialists.

200
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:29,712
The BKA, the BND and the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution.

201
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:32,423
But you have your prosecutors.

202
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:35,629
Files are disappearing in my own agency.

203
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:40,508
Rome wasn't built in a day.

204
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:45,583
When we fought on the streets for the SPD in the Weimar Republic,

205
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:51,172
You were in more of a hurry there than here, in your cozy official villa.

206
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,297
I made you Attorney General.

207
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:58,527
Stick with it, take them to court, but don't feel sorry for yourself.

208
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:03,630
In a few years, Germany will be able to forgive them and face their past.

209
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:07,092
If Eichmann escapes,

210
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:12,550
then I won't have the strength for a few more years, Georg.

211
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:17,882
I will contact the Mossad.

212
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:30,670
This is treason.

213
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:34,752
There should be no doubt about my patriotism.

214
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:40,501
- If this gets out, you'll go to jail. - That's why no one would know except you.

215
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:49,426
I don't think that's a wise decision, Fritz.

216
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:54,383
And what do you think I should answer Lothar Hermann's letter?

217
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:02,591
You have a visitor. Mr. Gebhardt from the Federal Criminal Police Office.

218
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:11,464
- Gebhardt. - Yes. Our friend seems to be regaining his strength.

219
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:16,011
But.

220
00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:20,007
I heard he canceled a trip to see his sister shortly before. Do you know the reason?

221
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:25,340
It's always the same reason, Gebhardt. He's obsessed.

222
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:30,336
- Ambition isn't something everyone is born with, unfortunately. - Everything in its own time, Gebhardt.

223
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:36,260
They are very calm, but our friends who are now abroad are not having such a comfortable time.

224
00:22:36,666 --> 00:22:38,551
Who are you thinking of?

225
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:42,420
I don't know exactly, that's my problem.

226
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:46,005
Farmer has a new horse, and I don't know who he has in his sights.

227
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,633
He has submitted a request to Interpol

228
00:22:48,916 --> 00:22:54,878
without being specific, and knowing whether the high-ranking SS officer whose arrest warrant is being sought can be arrested abroad.

229
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:57,217
Mhm. What did you answer?

230
00:22:57,583 --> 00:23:01,636
- That we are not responsible for political crimes. - Exactly.

231
00:23:01,916 --> 00:23:04,796
He can't do anything, he is completely isolated.

232
00:23:05,125 --> 00:23:07,293
Don't underestimate him.

233
00:23:17,541 --> 00:23:21,547
- What is that? Danish? - Yes. - I can't read that.

234
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:24,390
It is a report from the immigration police.

235
00:23:24,475 --> 00:23:29,340
Bauer was caught several times with prostitutes in Denmark, with male prostitutes.

236
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:33,131
- He's gay? - Yes.

237
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:36,666
Oh.

238
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:40,006
The Jew is gay?

239
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:46,879
- If we catch him with some guy, he's finished. - Exactly.

240
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:53,835
And even a monk has to fuck sometime.

241
00:23:59,583 --> 00:24:01,302
May I?

242
00:24:01,583 --> 00:24:02,839
Please.

243
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:08,587
- Enjoy your meal, Angermann. - Enjoy your meal.

244
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:26,917
- It's not so bad today. - Yes, of course.

245
00:24:34,291 --> 00:24:36,425
This case concerns me.

246
00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:40,336
- What's going on? - A 175.

247
00:24:41,291 --> 00:24:44,254
A young medical student named Johann Kraus.

248
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:48,628
Shortly before completing his studies, he was denounced for his homosexuality

249
00:24:48,958 --> 00:24:53,793
He was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for "unnatural lewdness."

250
00:24:54,166 --> 00:24:56,100
He lost his study permit.

251
00:24:56,195 --> 00:24:59,795
And now he's been caught serving a public need instead of being a prostitute.

252
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:04,588
He had earned five marks through mutual masturbation.

253
00:25:06,291 --> 00:25:09,800
I'm not sure what sentence I should ask for.

254
00:25:10,958 --> 00:25:13,008
Six months in prison.

255
00:25:14,291 --> 00:25:16,129
Where is the problem?

256
00:25:16,416 --> 00:25:19,047
Six months for mutual masturbation?

257
00:25:20,333 --> 00:25:23,711
You seem personally attacked, Angermann.

258
00:25:26,833 --> 00:25:28,338
Yes, I am too.

259
00:25:28,583 --> 00:25:33,802
Because only through the tightening of Paragraph 175 by the National Socialists did mutual masturbation become a criminal offense.

260
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:37,835
The Federal Court of Justice has ruled

261
00:25:38,166 --> 00:25:42,468
the law does not embody typical National Socialist worldviews.

262
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,011
Yes.

263
00:25:45,625 --> 00:25:47,628
I have to go again.

264
00:25:52,416 --> 00:25:56,292
- Are you familiar with the Valentin ruling? - No.

265
00:25:56,625 --> 00:26:00,583
Hamburg Regional Court, approximately summer '51.

266
00:26:02,541 --> 00:26:05,256
This might interest you.

267
00:26:12,583 --> 00:26:18,094
Welcome aboard our DC-6 International Airline flight

268
00:26:22,958 --> 00:26:28,090
Please place your large hand luggage safely under the seat in front of you

269
00:26:46,541 --> 00:26:49,884
Is there any news for me?

270
00:26:50,625 --> 00:26:53,552
No, sir. No news.

271
00:26:54,291 --> 00:26:56,508
- Thank you. - Have a nice day.

272
00:27:10,125 --> 00:27:12,044
Thanks.

273
00:27:14,786 --> 00:27:16,593
Thank you.

274
00:27:50,125 --> 00:27:52,670
No!

275
00:27:53,125 --> 00:27:56,882
- Who's there? - Dr. Bauer?

276
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:59,756
- Yes? - We're supposed to pick you up.

277
00:28:00,083 --> 00:28:02,252
Okay. Come in!

278
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:10,199
- Good morning. - Hello. One moment, please.

279
00:28:39,925 --> 00:28:42,211
You can take off the mask.

280
00:28:43,583 --> 00:28:46,545
Excuse the security precautions.

281
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:50,382
Sorry. I don't understand Yiddish.

282
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,794
Harel. You can call me lsser.

283
00:28:55,583 --> 00:28:56,709
Is it true?

284
00:28:57,583 --> 00:29:01,376
My name is Fritz. I wasn't expecting to see you in person.

285
00:29:01,625 --> 00:29:05,417
I didn't mean for us to have no interest in Eichmann.

286
00:29:07,708 --> 00:29:10,919
In the last few months we have carried out two investigations.

287
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:15,505
This file contains everything we have discovered.

288
00:29:16,583 --> 00:29:18,586
The trail is a dead trail.

289
00:29:19,333 --> 00:29:23,209
A dead lead? That can't be true.

290
00:29:23,541 --> 00:29:25,675
I wish it were different.

291
00:29:26,625 --> 00:29:30,133
The first examination was conducted by one of my men.

292
00:29:30,375 --> 00:29:33,586
But he didn't find anyone similar to Eichmann.

293
00:29:34,166 --> 00:29:37,509
No Eichmann? And who is that?

294
00:29:38,708 --> 00:29:41,588
This is Nick Eichmann's mother, Vera Leibl.

295
00:29:42,166 --> 00:29:44,632
Vera Leibl-Eichmann, Eichmanns Frau!

296
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:48,212
We conducted a second investigation.

297
00:29:48,541 --> 00:29:51,919
Silvia Hermann entered the house under false pretenses.

298
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:54,301
She is a brave girl.

299
00:29:54,583 --> 00:29:56,835
Silvia Hermann was in the house?

300
00:29:57,291 --> 00:30:01,463
She confirmed that a man of Eichmannâs age lives there,

301
00:30:01,708 --> 00:30:04,125
and that Nick calls him "Tate".

302
00:30:06,416 --> 00:30:09,047
- Nick calls him "Father." - There you go!

303
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:13,547
- But Vera Leibl apparently remarried after the war. - What?

304
00:30:14,875 --> 00:30:17,885
- She remarried - I know.

305
00:30:18,208 --> 00:30:23,376
I interviewed her mother in Germany and find her testimony completely unbelievable.

306
00:30:23,625 --> 00:30:26,208
Vera Leibl is said to have remarried after the war

307
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:30,885
and emigrated to America with the new husband and the three Eichmann sons.

308
00:30:31,333 --> 00:30:35,588
Since then, the mother claims not to have heard from her, yet no one else in the family has allegedly had any contact.

309
00:30:35,916 --> 00:30:39,128
They don't even know whether it's South or North America, you understand?

310
00:30:39,708 --> 00:30:43,465
I don't think she remarried.

311
00:30:43,666 --> 00:30:49,260
- The house owner is Austrian. - Eichmann is Austrian.

312
00:30:49,708 --> 00:30:51,925
Francisco Schmidt.

313
00:30:52,375 --> 00:30:56,511
We checked him. He is definitely not Adolf Eichmann.

314
00:31:01,625 --> 00:31:03,675
And what is that?

315
00:31:03,958 --> 00:31:07,502
The electricity meter is registered under both names.

316
00:31:07,791 --> 00:31:13,641
Electricity meter? Two tenants distribute: "Klement" and "Dagoto." Have you checked the names?

317
00:31:14,625 --> 00:31:20,752
Adolf Eichmann stole from the richest people in Europe.

318
00:31:21,083 --> 00:31:22,802
Do you seriously believe

319
00:31:23,125 --> 00:31:27,877
when he wished to stay in the house for twelve years?

320
00:31:34,208 --> 00:31:37,586
This is our file on Eichmann.

321
00:31:38,958 --> 00:31:43,793
One person claims he works in Nassere's advisory staff in Cairo.

322
00:31:44,625 --> 00:31:49,045
Someone else says he flies back and forth between Africa and Switzerland.

323
00:31:50,416 --> 00:31:55,086
And according to this, he lives in Kiel and breeds rabbits.

324
00:31:56,791 --> 00:32:01,342
They should have checked the two names on the electricity meter: Klement and Dagoto.

325
00:32:01,666 --> 00:32:06,802
I must defend the living Jews of Israel, not the dead.

326
00:32:10,875 --> 00:32:13,422
You can have your letter back.

327
00:32:14,083 --> 00:32:17,129
Unfortunately, we cannot help you.

328
00:32:20,958 --> 00:32:24,169
The Mossad is a small secret service.

329
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:28,588
I must deploy my people against our Arab enemies.

330
00:32:30,708 --> 00:32:33,422
- You speak German! - Yes.

331
00:32:34,291 --> 00:32:36,176
But not gladly.

332
00:32:42,791 --> 00:32:47,543
If you find a second, independent source,

333
00:32:47,958 --> 00:32:51,797
which clearly states that Eichmann is in Argentina,

334
00:32:52,125 --> 00:32:54,128
I can continue.

335
00:33:09,541 --> 00:33:09,998
- This can't be true! - Silence in the courtroom!

336
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,543
- This can't be true! - Silence in the courtroom!

337
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:17,803
Quiet or I'll clear the hall!

338
00:33:20,625 --> 00:33:25,792
Mr. Prosecutor Angermann, would you please explain to the court how you came to this conclusion,

339
00:33:26,208 --> 00:33:31,506
to demand such an absurd sentence for the defendant Johann Kraus?

340
00:33:31,875 --> 00:33:36,758
I refer to the Valentin judgment of 21 June 51 in Hamburg,

341
00:33:37,083 --> 00:33:41,136
in the district court director Dr. Valentin in a similar case

342
00:33:41,416 --> 00:33:45,837
sentenced two men to three marks each for continued same-sex activity.

343
00:33:46,708 --> 00:33:50,593
Since the defendant earned five marks through mutual masturbation,

344
00:33:50,916 --> 00:33:54,839
I consider my demand for a fine of five marks to be justified.

345
00:33:58,125 --> 00:34:01,254
- Quiet! - Anyone can leave now

346
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,960
In the name of the people, the following judgment is issued:

347
00:34:13,583 --> 00:34:17,541
Five months in prison for homosexual prostitution.

348
00:34:19,208 --> 00:34:22,467
The court also orders

349
00:34:22,491 --> 00:34:28,541
that the convicted person may not have any contact with men under the age of 21 in the future.

350
00:34:29,583 --> 00:34:31,917
The hearing is closed.

351
00:34:57,666 --> 00:34:59,634
I would like to thank you.

352
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:04,542
- Thank you for what? - I'm a friend of Johann Kraus.

353
00:35:05,166 --> 00:35:10,464
You were there, and you saw for yourself the inhumane sentence I helped to pass on him.

354
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:13,553
What you did took a lot of courage.

355
00:35:14,583 --> 00:35:15,673
For that

356
00:35:16,625 --> 00:35:19,339
I would like to thank you.

357
00:35:22,166 --> 00:35:26,504
- Why don't you come by sometime? - At the "Kokett"? I don't think

358
00:35:31,125 --> 00:35:37,548
Good morning, Miss SchÃ¼tt. Has anything unusual happened here during my absence?

359
00:35:37,833 --> 00:35:40,002
Oh yes, a little scandal.

360
00:35:40,291 --> 00:35:45,376
Public prosecutor Angermann demanded a fine of five marks for a 175 cc car at the regional court.

361
00:35:45,625 --> 00:35:49,050
The judge was beside himself. You can imagine.

362
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:53,338
And

363
00:35:54,125 --> 00:35:55,879
can I.

364
00:36:07,875 --> 00:36:09,629
Mr. Angermann.

365
00:36:10,333 --> 00:36:13,130
- Dr. Bauer, greetings. - Good evening.

366
00:36:13,416 --> 00:36:16,628
I heard about your request for a scandalous sentence.

367
00:36:16,958 --> 00:36:20,004
- Because of the five marks? - A "Heiermann," as they say.

368
00:36:20,291 --> 00:36:25,589
For immoral homosexual prostitution. You're certainly bold!

369
00:36:25,916 --> 00:36:29,092
Chief Public Prosecutor Kreidler considers it a scandal.

370
00:36:29,416 --> 00:36:34,051
And I think it is a scandal that Kreidler is the senior public prosecutor.

371
00:36:34,333 --> 00:36:38,718
- I have something to discuss with you. Could you come to me on Saturday? - Saturday?

372
00:36:39,083 --> 00:36:42,426
It's not official but confidential, so I don't want to discuss it in the office.

373
00:36:42,666 --> 00:36:46,009
My friends are getting a new kitchen on Saturday. Would Sunday be possible?

374
00:36:46,291 --> 00:36:48,626
- Okay. 11 o'clock? - Sure.

375
00:37:21,916 --> 00:37:24,085
Ah, Angermann!

376
00:37:25,041 --> 00:37:27,672
- Good day, Dr. Bauer. - Good day.

377
00:37:30,208 --> 00:37:32,542
- Coffee? - With pleasure.

378
00:37:33,833 --> 00:37:35,670
Please take off your coat.

379
00:37:36,625 --> 00:37:37,834
Yes.

380
00:37:47,416 --> 00:37:48,672
Tchaikovsky.

381
00:37:49,291 --> 00:37:51,460
Pathetic Symphony

382
00:37:52,333 --> 00:37:53,885
My favorite music.

383
00:37:54,958 --> 00:37:58,548
Yes, fine. What's it about, Dr. Bauer?

384
00:37:59,625 --> 00:38:02,552
Your wife will survive, Angermann.

385
00:38:03,666 --> 00:38:08,134
Sorry. She's very Catholic, and today is Sunday.

386
00:38:08,583 --> 00:38:11,463
- How long have you been married? - Two years.

387
00:38:12,083 --> 00:38:15,342
- Children? - No. - Why not?

388
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:19,548
Why did you want to talk to me?

389
00:38:24,666 --> 00:38:26,551
Read this.

390
00:38:53,791 --> 00:38:56,173
What do you want to do?

391
00:38:56,916 --> 00:38:59,547
I contacted the Mossad.

392
00:39:00,875 --> 00:39:06,007
But they demand a second, independent source that confirms Eichmann in Argentina,

393
00:39:06,291 --> 00:39:08,626
before starting an operation.

394
00:39:08,958 --> 00:39:12,004
Do you know "The Way"?

395
00:39:14,291 --> 00:39:17,171
A right-wing propaganda sheet from Buenos Aires.

396
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:24,699
I want you to find out whether this name actually represents Adolf Eichmann.

397
00:39:33,708 --> 00:39:37,216
What will the Mossad do if we find a second source?

398
00:39:39,666 --> 00:39:44,592
Kidnap Eichmann and bring him to trial, I think. What do you think?

399
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:51,170
I think we're committing treason. The BND is our executive branch.

400
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:55,426
Do you really think the BND doesn't know where these people are hiding?

401
00:39:55,666 --> 00:39:57,835
And the CIA probably knows it too.

402
00:39:58,958 --> 00:40:03,544
- At most, they would warn Eichmann. - I'm not so sure about that.

403
00:40:04,166 --> 00:40:07,046
Even if the BND orders many former Nazis,

404
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:12,548
he must bow to Adenauer's policies. And Adenauer wants reconciliation with Israel.

405
00:40:13,416 --> 00:40:18,003
Perhaps a major trial against a war criminal like Eichmann would be quite welcome.

406
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:20,045
Are you serious?

407
00:40:20,333 --> 00:40:24,919
In such a trial, Eichmann would name countless names in connection with the Final Solution,

408
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:29,505
perhaps even that of State Secretary Hans Globke.

409
00:40:36,291 --> 00:40:42,548
Adenauer may want to correct the image of the Germans, but he won't give up his right hand for that.

410
00:40:42,833 --> 00:40:47,798
Globke controls the Chancellery, the BND, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and the CDU.

411
00:40:48,833 --> 00:40:53,218
In any case, his name would be mentioned in connection with the deportations,

412
00:40:53,583 --> 00:40:58,253
if only because of his legal commentary on the Nuremberg Race Laws.

413
00:40:58,541 --> 00:41:00,710
Globke is guilty.

414
00:41:01,541 --> 00:41:05,215
And if Globke falls, it threatens the entire Adenauer government.

415
00:41:05,583 --> 00:41:09,173
And if Adenauer has a problem, the USA has a problem.

416
00:41:09,416 --> 00:41:13,007
Nobody from Bonn to Washington wants Eichmann to go to trial.

417
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:20,336
- But treason can't be the solution. - Damn it, Angermann!

418
00:41:20,583 --> 00:41:23,992
Do you want justice or just a new kitchen?

419
00:41:27,208 --> 00:41:30,337
If we want to do something for our country,

420
00:41:31,208 --> 00:41:33,590
In this case we have to reveal it.

421
00:41:39,916 --> 00:41:42,002
I have to think about it.

422
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:44,419
Oh, forget it.

423
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:47,381
I was obviously mistaken.

424
00:41:47,791 --> 00:41:51,382
Go home. Install the new oven.

425
00:41:51,625 --> 00:41:55,547
I hope you bought a German product.

426
00:41:56,541 --> 00:41:57,700
With all due respect, Dr. Bauer.

427
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:00,927
Do you think you can persuade me to commit treason with this political polemic?

428
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:06,426
You sound more and more like the one your opponents want you to be

429
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:09,839
- like a vengeful man! - Oho, oho!

430
00:42:10,166 --> 00:42:14,587
Don't force yourself. You mean like a vengeful Jew!

431
00:42:15,583 --> 00:42:18,261
What are you doing, Angermann?

432
00:42:19,083 --> 00:42:23,504
Allow me to be your friend. Good day.

433
00:42:27,416 --> 00:42:32,761
We have a very young audience today. But please don't hold back, Dr. Bauer.

434
00:42:33,125 --> 00:42:35,839
Open the eyes of these young people!

435
00:42:37,541 --> 00:42:40,089
Please don't go easy on our audience.

436
00:42:55,375 --> 00:42:58,918
I remember that I devoured all of his writings during my studies!

437
00:43:00,333 --> 00:43:02,585
He used to be so optimistic but

438
00:43:02,875 --> 00:43:04,296
Oh!

439
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:12,380
- The guests will be here soon. - We still have time.

440
00:43:15,083 --> 00:43:16,754
I can't.

441
00:43:17,208 --> 00:43:18,927
No, please. I

442
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:22,217
I can't now.

443
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:27,418
I can now...Aren't you listening? I had an argument with the general today.

444
00:43:27,625 --> 00:43:32,045
- What are you afraid of? Losing your job? - No!

445
00:43:32,791 --> 00:43:34,592
Yes too.

446
00:43:34,833 --> 00:43:38,542
My brother would be happy and you would earn more.

447
00:43:38,791 --> 00:43:43,342
Please don't start talking about that now. I don't want to work as a criminal defense attorney!

448
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:47,990
Whatever you want, as long as we don't have children, it's fine.

449
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:53,506
- There are even supposed to be prosecutors with children! Imagine! - Yes? Then ask them how they're made.

450
00:43:58,583 --> 00:44:00,752
- Karl. - Good evening, Hans.

451
00:44:05,166 --> 00:44:09,219
The kitchen is wonderful. Thanks again, that was very generous.

452
00:44:09,583 --> 00:44:14,217
You don't need to thank me. Finally fill this house with life.

453
00:44:14,583 --> 00:44:19,335
- That's amazing. - Great, isn't it? It turned out fantastic.

454
00:44:19,791 --> 00:44:22,553
- Well, angel? - Thank you very much! - Satisfied?

455
00:44:22,916 --> 00:44:26,792
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to our discussion at the Kellerclub.

456
00:44:27,708 --> 00:44:30,754
- Hessian Attorney General Dr. Fritz Bauer - Ingrid! Here we go!

457
00:44:31,083 --> 00:44:35,504
meets a young audience to address the questions of their generation.

458
00:44:35,916 --> 00:44:39,128
Right now, right now the discussion begins.

459
00:44:39,583 --> 00:44:41,053
Dr. Bauer; I would like to ask you

460
00:44:41,416 --> 00:44:44,676
What can a German still be proud of today?

461
00:45:14,416 --> 00:45:21,041
- I don't know if I understand your question correctly - Well, people like you have made us think so badly of Germany.

462
00:45:21,541 --> 00:45:25,117
And we are asked to show energy and interest,

463
00:45:25,291 --> 00:45:27,460
to build something, how is that supposed to work?

464
00:45:30,375 --> 00:45:32,642
Sorry, that wasn't my intention.

465
00:45:36,083 --> 00:45:40,420
You know, after the war, when I

466
00:45:40,666 --> 00:45:46,513
When I returned to Germany for the first time, I traveled on the train with a young man.

467
00:45:48,541 --> 00:45:49,667
Karl!

468
00:45:49,958 --> 00:45:53,667
- We were just bragging about politics, he told me about himself - Oh!

469
00:45:54,125 --> 00:45:55,843
Your boss, right?

470
00:45:56,291 --> 00:45:58,626
- Yes. - of his hopes, of the whole of human life

471
00:46:00,541 --> 00:46:04,132
- Charlotte! - I'd love to see that too, angel.

472
00:46:05,583 --> 00:46:08,759
Oh, the general in the basement? That'll be interesting.

473
00:46:09,083 --> 00:46:15,009
Then I thought to myself: "For this generation, it is worth

474
00:46:15,291 --> 00:46:19,510
to return to Germany from exile."

475
00:46:20,583 --> 00:46:23,545
But if you ask me about me,

476
00:46:24,583 --> 00:46:27,545
quite human, then I must tell you

477
00:46:28,541 --> 00:46:30,295
It seems to me

478
00:46:30,583 --> 00:46:35,217
as if the walls were collapsing on me from everywhere.

479
00:46:35,583 --> 00:46:40,335
You have to stop there, and there and there too, because everything is collapsing on me.

480
00:46:40,583 --> 00:46:46,130
But Dr. Bauer, we have a democratic constitution, and we can be proud of it!

481
00:46:46,583 --> 00:46:48,135
Can you see it

482
00:46:49,958 --> 00:46:52,376
I think we Germans

483
00:46:55,166 --> 00:46:59,421
cannot be proud of our forests and our mountains,

484
00:46:59,666 --> 00:47:01,752
because we can't do anything about it.

485
00:47:02,083 --> 00:47:06,302
We cannot be proud of Goethe and Schiller either

486
00:47:06,708 --> 00:47:11,543
and not on Einstein either, because we can't do anything about all that.

487
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:16,668
We can only be proud of the good things we have done ourselves.

488
00:47:17,833 --> 00:47:19,504
Only today

489
00:47:20,166 --> 00:47:25,334
A young person who means a lot to me told me that I am tough, sometimes hurtful.

490
00:47:25,625 --> 00:47:30,529
It's just as difficult for me as it is for everyone else to always be good.

491
00:47:30,666 --> 00:47:36,592
But I believe that the atmosphere in the Federal Republic of Germany is determined by this

492
00:47:36,875 --> 00:47:41,461
what we all do every day, as fathers, as mothers, as sons.

493
00:47:41,666 --> 00:47:45,542
You can make paragraphs and write articles,

494
00:47:45,875 --> 00:47:50,627
You can have the best constitution. What you need are the people,

495
00:47:51,083 --> 00:47:53,584
who live these democratic things.

496
00:47:53,841 --> 00:47:59,553
What sentimentality. Is this how this person runs his agency?

497
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:03,756
No one creates democracy

498
00:48:04,333 --> 00:48:08,505
Don't worry, Karl. Old guard, our lord father.

499
00:48:10,958 --> 00:48:14,715
This is the task we all face.

500
00:48:15,041 --> 00:48:19,130
We must not lose courage

501
00:48:19,916 --> 00:48:21,552
Come on, Karl.

502
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:40,881
Karl?

503
00:48:45,791 --> 00:48:47,213
What are you doing?

504
00:48:48,708 --> 00:48:51,339
Karl, would you please come down immediately?

505
00:49:11,583 --> 00:49:15,755
He is a good informant, and I know that he has contacts with "The Way" in Argentina.

506
00:49:16,166 --> 00:49:20,125
- Is he trustworthy? - In the Third Reich, he was in Hitler's enemy reconnaissance department.

507
00:49:20,583 --> 00:49:25,335
So one of Reinhard Gehlen's men? Is he now working for the BND?

508
00:49:25,583 --> 00:49:30,300
- But maybe also for the other side. - For the Stasi? - It's possible.

509
00:49:30,625 --> 00:49:32,758
But he is a good informant.

510
00:49:33,083 --> 00:49:36,461
In my opinion, he is one thing above all: for sale.

511
00:49:38,416 --> 00:49:42,588
If he works for the Stasi, we'll go to prison.

512
00:49:45,541 --> 00:49:48,089
And if he is a loyal BND man,

513
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:51,545
he might warn Eichmann.

514
00:49:52,333 --> 00:49:56,042
But if we're lucky, he'll find a second source.

515
00:50:12,416 --> 00:50:14,301
Let's take the risk.

516
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:23,376
- Good presentation, Dr. Bauer. - Your words moved me deeply.

517
00:50:23,625 --> 00:50:25,628
Yes, yes, thank you.

518
00:50:28,083 --> 00:50:30,216
Great, Dr. Bauer, absolutely great!

519
00:50:38,583 --> 00:50:40,384
Good morning

520
00:50:40,516 --> 00:50:43,941
- What a wonderful performance. - Yes, enough. Thank you.

521
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:50,835
- Is it your birthday? - No, it came from Prime Minister Zinn with this telegram, here.

522
00:50:54,291 --> 00:50:56,508
And this is your mail.

523
00:50:57,333 --> 00:51:00,592
I'll never appear on television again if that's the case.

524
00:51:00,916 --> 00:51:04,092
Keep the flowers! They're not for me.

525
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:12,752
- What's going on? - I need information about a journalist,

526
00:52:13,083 --> 00:52:15,761
who writes for "The Way" in Argentina.

527
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:22,265
His name is Klaus Eichmann and we wonder if Adolf Eichmann is behind it.

528
00:52:23,583 --> 00:52:26,048
You'd like to know, wouldn't you?

529
00:52:26,291 --> 00:52:30,048
That would be a scoop for the vengeful TV prosecutor,

530
00:52:30,333 --> 00:52:33,260
if he could find dear Uncle Eichmann.

531
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:39,130
- Can you figure it out or not? - Of course. It's just a question of price.

532
00:52:43,166 --> 00:52:48,002
- These are from the last few days. - Because of the TV show.

533
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:52,009
- They came in the mail today? - Yes. - 9 mm.

534
00:52:52,416 --> 00:52:55,296
As far as I know, you are armed, Mr. Bauer?

535
00:52:56,583 --> 00:52:58,503
Yes that is correct.

536
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:01,550
What caliber is your gun?

537
00:53:02,041 --> 00:53:04,719
- 9 mm. - Also. Look.

538
00:53:05,708 --> 00:53:11,255
- I'd like to see your weapon. - Do you think he writes threatening letters to himself?

539
00:53:11,583 --> 00:53:15,292
- I never said that, how do you know that? - Why do you want to see my gun?

540
00:53:16,875 --> 00:53:20,797
What exactly was the motivation for your television appearance?

541
00:53:24,208 --> 00:53:25,843
Out.

542
00:53:26,166 --> 00:53:27,127
Out!

543
00:53:27,416 --> 00:53:32,252
- If we're to investigate, you have to cooperate. - Forget the opportunity!

544
00:53:42,375 --> 00:53:45,468
Could I perhaps speak to you privately?

545
00:53:56,541 --> 00:54:00,334
You just misunderstood that, Mr. Attorney General.

546
00:54:00,583 --> 00:54:02,882
I support your cause wherever I can.

547
00:54:03,583 --> 00:54:04,709
Yes.

548
00:54:05,666 --> 00:54:08,048
I have a reliable source,

549
00:54:08,333 --> 00:54:11,923
according to which a person you are looking for is in Kuwait.

550
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:16,505
The person is ObersturmbandfÃ¼hrer Adolf Eichmann.

551
00:54:16,875 --> 00:54:18,925
He's hiding in Kuwait.

552
00:54:21,541 --> 00:54:23,295
That's interesting.

553
00:54:23,708 --> 00:54:27,796
In fact, we have been looking for Adolf Eichmann for a long time.

554
00:54:29,833 --> 00:54:33,542
But as you have already confirmed to me several times,

555
00:54:34,083 --> 00:54:39,795
Neither the BKA nor Interpol is responsible for political criminals.

556
00:54:40,583 --> 00:54:42,586
Correct. Unfortunately.

557
00:54:42,875 --> 00:54:48,836
You should simply file an extradition request, then we can cooperate with the local authorities.

558
00:54:50,375 --> 00:54:54,132
Thank you, Mr. Gebhardt. I'll take care of that.

559
00:54:57,583 --> 00:55:00,593
We must protect our country from its enemies.

560
00:55:02,208 --> 00:55:04,425
Yes, that's probably right.

561
00:55:14,750 --> 00:55:16,551
What happened?

562
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:19,550
I need some fresh air.

563
00:55:21,833 --> 00:55:25,044
I won't be coming back, Miss SchÃ¼tt.

564
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:40,917
- Dr. Bauer, what did Gebhardt say? - It's over, Angermann.

565
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:45,338
- Get back to business as usual. We've been exposed. - Why?

566
00:55:45,625 --> 00:55:49,678
Gebhardt told me, without being asked, that Eichmann was in Kuwait.

567
00:55:49,958 --> 00:55:54,379
- He knows we're looking for him. - Morlach! This is my fault.

568
00:55:54,625 --> 00:55:56,793
No, that wasn't your fault, we had to try.

569
00:55:57,125 --> 00:56:00,467
But if Gebhardt knows, Eichmann will be long gone.

570
00:56:00,708 --> 00:56:03,291
It's far too dangerous for far too many people.

571
00:56:04,333 --> 00:56:09,501
Maybe it was really naive of me to think we could bring him to trial in Frankfurt.

572
00:56:11,708 --> 00:56:14,505
But that would have been something, Angermann.

573
00:56:16,583 --> 00:56:17,839
Gebhardt!

574
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:23,295
He had the nerve to tell me that we had to protect our country from its enemies.

575
00:56:23,583 --> 00:56:26,712
The SS-UntersturmfÃ¼hrer in the security service! Me!

576
00:56:27,833 --> 00:56:32,384
I fought for the SPD on the streets during the Weimar Republic!

577
00:56:33,375 --> 00:56:36,753
My father fought for our Kaiser in World War I.

578
00:56:37,125 --> 00:56:41,959
Tell me, Angermann. Tell me honestly, am I an enemy of our country?

579
00:56:43,416 --> 00:56:45,715
No, Fritz, you are not.

580
00:56:50,583 --> 00:56:54,173
- Goodbye, Karl. - What will you do now?

581
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:58,044
Sleep. Sleep for a very long time.

582
00:57:05,291 --> 00:57:07,045
Quitting time!

583
00:57:45,583 --> 00:57:49,043
- Good evening. Thank you very much. - Have a nice evening.

584
00:57:50,333 --> 00:57:54,505
That's not the case with me.

585
00:57:55,208 --> 00:58:00,127
I play my game the way I want!

586
00:58:00,625 --> 00:58:03,670
Incognito, incognito.

587
00:58:03,958 --> 00:58:06,043
Come, play with me.

588
00:58:06,333 --> 00:58:08,170
From today we are

589
00:58:09,041 --> 00:58:11,838
incognito, incognito.

590
00:58:12,708 --> 00:58:16,335
- No one will ever know - A whiskey, please.

591
00:58:16,916 --> 00:58:21,171
What we are and what we were.

592
00:58:21,625 --> 00:58:27,136
Come on, let's take it to the extreme.

593
00:58:29,625 --> 00:58:35,551
As long as we remain incognito.

594
00:58:45,250 --> 00:58:46,111
Herein.

595
00:58:47,916 --> 00:58:52,422
I just wanted to say good evening. You sang beautifully.

596
00:58:52,666 --> 00:58:55,629
Hello, Mr. Angermann. Come in.

597
00:59:00,833 --> 00:59:03,511
- You remember? - Of course!

598
00:59:03,708 --> 00:59:06,588
I just didn't think you'd come by.

599
00:59:06,833 --> 00:59:08,801
I had a lot of work.

600
00:59:10,333 --> 00:59:13,676
You look unhappy, Mr. Prosecutor.

601
00:59:14,708 --> 00:59:16,592
A lost cause.

602
00:59:23,625 --> 00:59:27,382
Is there anything I can do to cheer you up?

603
00:59:41,583 --> 00:59:43,420
Do you know the prices?

604
00:59:44,166 --> 00:59:46,881
But you, Mr. Prosecutor, are family.

605
00:59:47,208 --> 00:59:49,258
It's free for you.

606
00:59:51,208 --> 00:59:52,927
No, please

607
00:59:53,791 --> 00:59:57,134
What are you doing here so late at night?

608
01:00:00,208 --> 01:00:02,176
I don't know, I

609
01:00:03,958 --> 01:00:06,885
I have to go too, unfortunately.

610
01:00:07,208 --> 01:00:09,176
They sang beautifully.

611
01:00:24,666 --> 01:00:27,593
- Hello? - I have news.

612
01:00:30,333 --> 01:00:32,916
What are you doing calling in the middle of the night?

613
01:00:44,791 --> 01:00:48,003
- That's not how it works. - Calm down, calm down!

614
01:00:48,291 --> 01:00:50,377
Prosecutor, what is it?

615
01:00:50,625 --> 01:00:54,003
You want to catch a big fish, right? Listen.

616
01:00:54,291 --> 01:00:58,510
I have news for you. Klaus Eichmann is not the man you're looking for. The last name is a coincidence.

617
01:00:58,916 --> 01:01:02,294
Stop that. I know you betrayed us.

618
01:01:02,583 --> 01:01:05,593
Me? Really? Before you paid me? Are you stupid?

619
01:01:08,791 --> 01:01:11,292
Maybe you'll get paid twice.

620
01:01:12,583 --> 01:01:15,993
Does the name Willem Sassen mean anything to you?

621
01:01:17,583 --> 01:01:20,842
He is Dutch and was an SS war correspondent.

622
01:01:21,166 --> 01:01:23,548
After the war he became PerÃ³n's press advisor.

623
01:01:23,833 --> 01:01:29,759
Since the political situation in Argentina is no longer so rosy, he has been having money problems.

624
01:01:31,883 --> 01:01:33,294
Who doesnât have one?

625
01:01:36,583 --> 01:01:39,131
Sassen lives in Buenos Aires

626
01:01:40,083 --> 01:01:41,754
and has for years

627
01:01:47,083 --> 01:01:49,003
Interviews conducted.

628
01:01:50,166 --> 01:01:52,844
Obviously dear Uncle Eichmann wants

629
01:01:53,333 --> 01:01:56,793
adjust his place in history somewhat.

630
01:01:57,750 --> 01:02:00,167
So he agreed to

631
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:04,553
Sassen to have his memoirs written.

632
01:02:07,083 --> 01:02:10,922
- You mean these are Adolf Eichmann's memoirs? - Yes, of course.

633
01:02:11,583 --> 01:02:15,989
But that's only part of it,Sassen has to watch hundreds of tapes.

634
01:02:17,741 --> 01:02:20,562
He thinks it will be a big hit.

635
01:02:21,083 --> 01:02:25,385
But since he's in a mess financially, he wants to sell some of it.

636
01:02:26,791 --> 01:02:28,759
In any case, it proves

637
01:02:31,208 --> 01:02:34,586
that Adolf Eichmann is imprisoned in Argentina.

638
01:02:35,375 --> 01:02:41,004
Can one say that you were definitely involved in the decimation of the Jews?

639
01:02:42,958 --> 01:02:47,592
Yes, yes. After all, I transported the Jews.

640
01:02:48,625 --> 01:02:51,884
Without me they wouldn't have come to the executioner.

641
01:02:52,625 --> 01:02:58,586
I am comparable to a commander who attacks a German city with his bomber squadron.

642
01:02:59,541 --> 01:03:01,923
Has he been convicted?

643
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:04,502
Why are we condemned?

644
01:03:05,083 --> 01:03:07,501
I didn't kill anyone.

645
01:03:08,666 --> 01:03:13,751
Just as the ground crew loaded the bombs, we transported the Jews.

646
01:03:20,333 --> 01:03:25,500
Apart from Morlach, only the Prime Minister knows about our search for Eichmann.

647
01:03:25,505 --> 01:03:27,676
Why should Gebhardt

648
01:03:28,250 --> 01:03:32,089
out of the blue talking about Eichmann?

649
01:03:35,916 --> 01:03:37,670
I don't know it.

650
01:03:41,583 --> 01:03:45,376
They contacted Gebhardt himself because of the death threats.

651
01:03:48,125 --> 01:03:51,301
Maybe he just dropped it, for no reason, pure coincidence.

652
01:03:51,583 --> 01:03:55,257
- Because he knows we're investigating. - Maybe.

653
01:03:57,958 --> 01:04:00,589
Dagoto or Clement?

654
01:04:01,583 --> 01:04:04,878
The Mossad should have checked these names.

655
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:10,391
Yes, I wonder how Eichmann lives these days. Does he have a job?

656
01:04:12,416 --> 01:04:17,382
Perhaps he, like so many Germans, works for this dubious company in Argentina?

657
01:04:17,625 --> 01:04:19,710
- Capri? - Yes.

658
01:04:20,541 --> 01:04:22,342
Or Mercedes.

659
01:04:24,416 --> 01:04:29,501
Schneider. He works at Mercedes-Benz in Stuttgart.

660
01:04:30,583 --> 01:04:32,337
SS-Schneider.

661
01:04:59,166 --> 01:05:01,750
Angermann, I'm going to get myself killed.

662
01:05:06,583 --> 01:05:08,917
Turn on the fan.

663
01:05:21,583 --> 01:05:24,759
- Yes, please? - Mr. Schneider, we have a visitor for you.

664
01:05:25,083 --> 01:05:30,511
- I didn't note down an appointment. - A Dr. Bauer; the Hessian Attorney General.

665
01:05:31,750 --> 01:05:33,420
Please.

666
01:05:39,208 --> 01:05:40,500
Thanks.

667
01:05:40,791 --> 01:05:44,465
- Good afternoon, Mr. Schneider. - Attorney General.

668
01:05:44,666 --> 01:05:46,551
- Please thank.

669
01:05:47,208 --> 01:05:49,425
How can I help you?

670
01:05:50,583 --> 01:05:56,046
I am investigating your activities with the security service's task forces.

671
01:06:10,750 --> 01:06:12,551
No calls please.

672
01:06:15,083 --> 01:06:18,922
There is a possibility that your case will be closed for the time being.

673
01:06:22,625 --> 01:06:24,462
And how?

674
01:06:24,666 --> 01:06:29,667
You're part of the human resources department here at Daimler, have I understood that correctly?

675
01:06:31,208 --> 01:06:32,464
Yes.

676
01:06:32,833 --> 01:06:38,427
I would like to know whether a Mr. Dagoto or a Mr. Klement

677
01:06:39,625 --> 01:06:42,552
works at Mercedes-Benz in Argentina.

678
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:03,791
And?

679
01:07:08,750 --> 01:07:11,428
We have our second source.

680
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:16,711
If Eichmann isn't gone.

681
01:07:27,125 --> 01:07:29,128
Come, play with me,

682
01:07:29,583 --> 01:07:33,506
From today on we are incognito.

683
01:07:33,791 --> 01:07:35,178
Incognito.

684
01:07:35,583 --> 01:07:40,004
No one will ever know

685
01:07:40,291 --> 01:07:44,652
what we are and what we were.

686
01:07:45,083 --> 01:07:51,258
Come on, letâs take it to the extreme,

687
01:07:52,958 --> 01:07:59,085
as long as we remain incognito.

688
01:08:18,625 --> 01:08:20,379
I'm happy to pay.

689
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:22,791
Really.

690
01:08:26,375 --> 01:08:28,627
I don't expect any favors.

691
01:08:29,875 --> 01:08:31,629
As you wish.

692
01:09:37,208 --> 01:09:38,927
Good morning!

693
01:09:49,583 --> 01:09:54,667
Hello, my angel. Sorry, we worked all night last night.

694
01:09:57,333 --> 01:09:59,502
Thank you. How lovely.

695
01:10:04,208 --> 01:10:05,500
Karl

696
01:10:07,125 --> 01:10:09,293
We're having a baby.

697
01:10:16,375 --> 01:10:20,381
- Good day, Miss SchÃ¼tt. - Good morning, Doctor.

698
01:10:21,708 --> 01:10:25,906
Please book me a flight to Paris next weekend,

699
01:10:25,958 --> 01:10:28,719
- Return flight a week later. - Will do.

700
01:10:29,041 --> 01:10:34,802
There was an urgent appointment request from Ludwigsburg. The head of the central office, Dr. SchÃ¼le, is looking for an appointment with you.

701
01:10:35,125 --> 01:10:38,752
- Is that what I'm putting behind your journey? - Did the student say what he wanted?

702
01:10:39,083 --> 01:10:43,136
It concerns an arrest warrant against a Mr. Eichmann, Adolf.

703
01:10:43,416 --> 01:10:46,131
Case number 6842.

704
01:10:47,791 --> 01:10:51,465
Ask Dr. SchÃ¼le how quickly he can get here.

705
01:10:52,083 --> 01:10:53,588
I'll do it.

706
01:10:59,625 --> 01:11:01,592
- Thank you very much. - Thank you.

707
01:11:04,708 --> 01:11:06,592
- Cigar? - With pleasure.

708
01:11:14,416 --> 01:11:16,419
Then tell me.

709
01:11:17,041 --> 01:11:20,087
Does the name Adolf Eichmann mean anything to you?

710
01:11:21,291 --> 01:11:22,417
Secure.

711
01:11:23,041 --> 01:11:25,293
We maintain the investigation file.

712
01:11:30,541 --> 01:11:34,594
I don't mean to offend you, Dr. Bauer, but you have to take action.

713
01:11:34,916 --> 01:11:38,590
A certain Tuviah Friedman, a private investigator from Israel

714
01:11:38,875 --> 01:11:42,169
He's giving me and the entire central office hell.

715
01:11:42,541 --> 01:11:46,132
He is in contact with a Mr. Hermann from Argentina.

716
01:11:46,375 --> 01:11:49,302
He says he knows that Eichmann is hiding in Argentina

717
01:11:50,250 --> 01:11:53,094
and you would know that and do nothing.

718
01:11:54,250 --> 01:11:59,168
Tell Mr. Tuviah Friedman that the Frankfurt public prosecutor's office

719
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:01,834
carries out her task conscientiously.

720
01:12:02,958 --> 01:12:05,541
And that we know from a reliable source,

721
01:12:05,833 --> 01:12:11,178
that Mr Eichmann is in Kuwait and not in Argentina.

722
01:12:14,166 --> 01:12:19,511
But he shouldn't pursue this any further now, do you understand, Dr. SchÃ¼le?

723
01:12:19,833 --> 01:12:25,759
Because if Eichmann is warned in Kuwait, he might disappear forever.

724
01:12:29,541 --> 01:12:32,836
Prepare a press conference, Angermann.

725
01:12:33,166 --> 01:12:34,837
When I come back,

726
01:12:35,166 --> 01:12:40,298
then we announce that we believe we have tracked down Eichmann in Kuwait.

727
01:12:46,041 --> 01:12:48,009
Dr. Bauer, I

728
01:12:49,541 --> 01:12:51,509
Good luck.

729
01:12:52,666 --> 01:12:55,001
What's going on, Angermann?

730
01:12:55,791 --> 01:12:57,759
I'm going to be a father.

731
01:12:59,791 --> 01:13:02,802
Will you accompany me to the airport?

732
01:13:08,625 --> 01:13:11,339
- Gebhardt here. - Yes, Kreidler.

733
01:13:11,666 --> 01:13:15,175
The general seems to be genuinely interested in Eichmann.

734
01:13:15,416 --> 01:13:20,880
This morning he met with Dr. SchÃ¼le from the Central Office of the State Justice Administration.

735
01:13:21,291 --> 01:13:25,510
He then told me that they were now looking for Eichmann in Kuwait.

736
01:13:25,916 --> 01:13:29,294
Yes. Some of our compatriots are actually staying in Kuwait.

737
01:13:31,791 --> 01:13:34,999
The general is currently traveling to Paris.

738
01:13:35,041 --> 01:13:40,718
I wonder whether the colleagues from the BND could take a look at Mr Bauer,

739
01:13:41,041 --> 01:13:44,336
with the persistent death threats recently.

740
01:13:44,666 --> 01:13:48,589
Yes, that's a good idea. I'll take care of it. Thanks.

741
01:13:56,083 --> 01:14:00,504
- I know I can't be a good father - Why do you think that?

742
01:14:02,916 --> 01:14:05,594
Don't worry, Mr. Mahler and I have known each other for many years.

743
01:14:06,041 --> 01:14:09,135
We have some skeletons in the closet.

744
01:14:09,583 --> 01:14:12,297
You can say whatever you want here without worry.

745
01:14:15,291 --> 01:14:17,757
There are these rumors about you, Dr. Bauer,

746
01:14:18,583 --> 01:14:24,343
Rumors that say that the Gestapo persecuted you not only as a socialist because of your Jewish origins

747
01:14:25,125 --> 01:14:28,467
It is said that you had special problems with the Danish vice squad.

748
01:14:28,791 --> 01:14:32,584
Yes. There were incidents.

749
01:14:34,916 --> 01:14:40,794
I've had the feeling for some time now that we have similar interests.

750
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:49,466
I met someone.

751
01:14:50,333 --> 01:14:53,509
- An "easy girl," you understand? - How often were you together?

752
01:14:55,166 --> 01:14:56,209
Once.

753
01:14:59,625 --> 01:15:01,675
What should I tell you, Karl?

754
01:15:02,166 --> 01:15:05,011
You know that you are committing a criminal offense.

755
01:15:05,291 --> 01:15:09,131
The first time, you can still excuse yourself as a client by saying

756
01:15:09,416 --> 01:15:13,007
that one did not know that the lady was not a lady.

757
01:15:13,583 --> 01:15:15,882
But not the second time.

758
01:15:18,250 --> 01:15:23,464
My wife Anna Maria and I have been separated for many years,

759
01:15:23,708 --> 01:15:27,133
She in Copenhagen, me here.

760
01:15:27,625 --> 01:15:31,334
I think it is one of the happiest marriages ever.

761
01:15:32,875 --> 01:15:37,342
If your wife is a good companion, you don't have to be afraid of raising children.

762
01:15:37,625 --> 01:15:40,552
You will be a fantastic father.

763
01:15:41,958 --> 01:15:44,803
I am so grateful for your openness.

764
01:15:46,583 --> 01:15:52,177
But the price we have to pay is very high.

765
01:15:53,833 --> 01:15:58,467
You mustn't see the young man again, Karl, you know that.

766
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:02,254
- Not? - Yes.

767
01:16:16,208 --> 01:16:19,384
Are you flying further? This way.

768
01:16:19,708 --> 01:16:23,051
- Are you flying on, sir? - Yes. - This way.

769
01:16:40,958 --> 01:16:44,585
- Yes? - The general flies on to Israel.

770
01:16:45,125 --> 01:16:47,423
Yes, wherever Jews fly.

771
01:16:47,750 --> 01:16:50,333
Maybe he turns to the Israeli secret service.

772
01:16:52,583 --> 01:16:55,048
That would be considered treason.

773
01:16:55,875 --> 01:16:57,261
Even.

774
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:21,839
Dr. Bauer.

775
01:17:22,583 --> 01:17:25,380
- Chaim Cohn. Call me Herman. - Good afternoon.

776
01:17:25,625 --> 01:17:28,505
Come in. Nice to finally meet you.

777
01:17:28,791 --> 01:17:34,041
You already know Isser Harel. This is Zvi Aharoni, who was also born in Germany.

778
01:17:34,333 --> 01:17:36,585
- I'm from the other Frankfurt. - Aha.

779
01:17:36,916 --> 01:17:41,053
By the way, you know that I studied in Frankfurt am Main.

780
01:17:41,416 --> 01:17:44,047
I should visit you sometime. Please sit down.

781
01:17:44,541 --> 01:17:48,879
- Would you like something to drink? - No, I want to get to the point.

782
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:54,127
I have discovered a second, independent source,

783
01:17:54,416 --> 01:17:58,553
which confirms that Eichmann's code name is Ricardo Klement.

784
01:17:58,958 --> 01:18:01,541
You already said that on the phone.

785
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:04,585
We need to verify your source.

786
01:18:04,958 --> 01:18:09,222
We've lost months and you want to check the source first?

787
01:18:09,225 --> 01:18:14,292
Eichmann could change his code name and move. How much more time will pass? It's simply unbelievable!

788
01:18:15,083 --> 01:18:18,461
Any second-rate cop could lead this investigation to success!

789
01:18:23,250 --> 01:18:25,928
Dr. Bauer, we understand your excitement.

790
01:18:26,250 --> 01:18:30,587
Zvi is a very capable officer. He is to lead the new investigation.

791
01:18:32,291 --> 01:18:38,336
I know the status of the investigation, which is, of course, as Harel says: if we can trust the second source, then I will lead an operation.

792
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:42,882
Who is the second source, Dr. Bauer?

793
01:18:43,333 --> 01:18:45,715
I have already risked the safety of the first source,

794
01:18:46,083 --> 01:18:49,840
and it was he who should have had the Hermann family examined.

795
01:18:50,166 --> 01:18:53,923
My second source remains secret. My word will have to suffice.

796
01:18:54,416 --> 01:18:57,759
Ricardo Klement is Adolf Eichmann.

797
01:18:59,791 --> 01:19:02,339
If you do not act now,

798
01:19:03,125 --> 01:19:05,708
I will contact the German authorities.

799
01:19:06,208 --> 01:19:08,507
If they helped, you wouldn't be here.

800
01:19:10,541 --> 01:19:11,714
Do you think so?

801
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:16,587
We will try our best, Dr. Bauer.

802
01:19:17,125 --> 01:19:18,511
Thanks.

803
01:19:19,041 --> 01:19:20,795
There is one more thing.

804
01:19:21,583 --> 01:19:26,967
If you have Eichmann, I will request his extradition to Israel.

805
01:19:27,333 --> 01:19:32,583
I do not want him to be judged in Israel as if he had murdered 6 million Jews alone.

806
01:19:33,041 --> 01:19:35,210
Eichmann must appear in court in Frankfurt.

807
01:19:35,583 --> 01:19:39,422
We must confront the Germans with their past.

808
01:19:50,583 --> 01:19:53,677
I will support your proposal, Dr. Bauer.

809
01:19:53,958 --> 01:19:56,127
Wonderful, thank you very much.

810
01:20:00,625 --> 01:20:02,011
Schalem.

811
01:20:04,583 --> 01:20:08,091
- And good luck. - I'll do my best.

812
01:20:10,208 --> 01:20:14,427
When I am back in Frankfurt, I will explain to the press,

813
01:20:14,666 --> 01:20:17,712
that I suspect Eichmann is in Kuwait.

814
01:20:18,916 --> 01:20:20,552
Gut.

815
01:20:23,833 --> 01:20:28,170
I have called this press conference

816
01:20:28,708 --> 01:20:32,335
because we learned from the Federal Criminal Police Office,

817
01:20:33,250 --> 01:20:39,425
that the SS ObersturmbandfÃ¼hrer Adolf Eichmann, who was responsible for the deportation of the Jews

818
01:20:39,666 --> 01:20:42,546
went into hiding in Kuwait.

819
01:20:43,541 --> 01:20:46,625
An extradition request has been submitted.

820
01:20:50,083 --> 01:20:53,009
Wait, please not all at once.

821
01:20:55,166 --> 01:20:58,627
Next stop: Carretera San Fernando.

822
01:21:35,350 --> 01:21:36,717
Wait, seÃ±or.

823
01:21:55,041 --> 01:21:58,917
The German people feel deep satisfaction,

824
01:21:59,250 --> 01:22:02,793
that through reparations for victims of Nazism

825
01:22:03,208 --> 01:22:08,091
and contribution to the development process of Israel

826
01:22:14,333 --> 01:22:19,417
The Germany of today is no longer the Germany of yesterday.

827
01:22:19,666 --> 01:22:22,001
I wish the Chancellor success in his efforts,

828
01:22:22,291 --> 01:22:27,459
To lead Germany on the path to democracy and international cooperation.

829
01:22:41,208 --> 01:22:44,005
- Yes? - We have him.

830
01:22:47,833 --> 01:22:49,421
Thanks.

831
01:23:29,916 --> 01:23:34,337
Extra edition! Extra edition! Adolf Eichmann caught in Argentina!

832
01:23:34,958 --> 01:23:37,127
Extra sheet! Extra sheet!

833
01:23:37,583 --> 01:23:40,629
Adolf Eichmann caught in Argentina!

834
01:23:44,708 --> 01:23:46,545
Dr. Bauer!

835
01:23:49,625 --> 01:23:51,509
Another glass please.

836
01:23:52,916 --> 01:23:56,590
- We did it, Karl! - I can't believe it!

837
01:23:58,958 --> 01:24:04,801
- You could tell me better in a quiet place. - I don't know any more!

838
01:24:05,125 --> 01:24:06,630
- Stupid, Karl! - Stupid!

839
01:24:10,041 --> 01:24:16,003
We are all lined up for morning roll call before the dreaded camp commandant,

840
01:24:17,583 --> 01:24:21,506
and he yells: "Schumacher! Why are you in a concentration camp?"

841
01:24:22,583 --> 01:24:27,587
Schumacher says: "Because I belong to the defeated party."

842
01:24:27,958 --> 01:24:30,541
He didn't know anything about that.

843
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:34,462
Kurt Schumacher remained in the concentration camp for twelve years.

844
01:24:34,666 --> 01:24:36,551
But I

845
01:24:37,583 --> 01:24:42,087
I have expressed my concern in an open letter

846
01:24:43,083 --> 01:24:47,302
subjected to the Nazis, they printed it in the newspaper:

847
01:24:47,583 --> 01:24:51,802
"The socialist farmer submits." That's where I got out.

848
01:24:56,833 --> 01:24:59,630
I have never forgiven myself for that.

849
01:25:01,833 --> 01:25:04,416
Schumacher did not submit.

850
01:25:05,750 --> 01:25:09,542
One must never bow to tyranny, Karl.

851
01:25:09,791 --> 01:25:11,047
Never.

852
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:20,545
I have to go upstairs now, I can't take any more.

853
01:25:47,666 --> 01:25:50,463
I'm a man,

854
01:25:50,666 --> 01:25:53,048
with everything included,

855
01:25:53,333 --> 01:25:56,213
what you do,

856
01:25:57,958 --> 01:26:00,541
and even if you laugh at me,

857
01:26:00,875 --> 01:26:02,794
I am just

858
01:26:03,583 --> 01:26:06,510
A sweet little freak of nature.

859
01:26:06,708 --> 01:26:10,927
I am a man, just look at me,

860
01:26:11,916 --> 01:26:14,133
because I don't mind

861
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:22,714
because this little quirk of nature

862
01:26:23,375 --> 01:26:25,757
leaves a big mark on me.

863
01:26:32,125 --> 01:26:36,462
The song is very reckless. Aren't you afraid at all?

864
01:26:38,041 --> 01:26:42,509
- You remember Johann Krause, Five-Mark-Johann? - Yes, why?

865
01:26:43,750 --> 01:26:45,993
He is the great love of my life.

866
01:26:48,891 --> 01:26:50,590
Augenblick!

867
01:26:51,583 --> 01:26:54,593
They promised me that Johann would come out early.

868
01:26:56,500 --> 01:26:59,794
- I'm sorry. - Stay seated, Prosecutor.

869
01:27:01,291 --> 01:27:04,467
Yes, yes, love is our downfall, isn't it?

870
01:27:14,416 --> 01:27:16,419
This one is also very beautiful.

871
01:27:18,958 --> 01:27:20,842
Yes, hm, hm

872
01:27:21,166 --> 01:27:24,677
Our little secret doesn't have to cost you your job or your family.

873
01:27:24,683 --> 01:27:28,376
I can keep a lot to myself. Incognito

874
01:27:31,375 --> 01:27:36,210
- What do you want? - Is Bauer behind the Eichmann kidnapping?

875
01:27:38,916 --> 01:27:41,417
I don't know what you're talking about.

876
01:27:43,583 --> 01:27:48,833
Good. You can keep the prints. Perhaps your wife would like to see them before

877
01:27:49,291 --> 01:27:51,460
No, no, wait!

878
01:27:51,833 --> 01:27:54,050
I'll give you a week.

879
01:27:54,333 --> 01:28:00,259
Either you accuse Bauer of treason because he, as a German official, collaborated with a foreign intelligence service

880
01:28:00,583 --> 01:28:02,716
or you go to jail.

881
01:28:30,833 --> 01:28:36,001
- Dr. Bauer, what do you say about the Eichmann kidnapping? - We should have succeeded!

882
01:28:36,583 --> 01:28:39,677
Yes. That would have been a great success.

883
01:28:41,166 --> 01:28:43,501
Herein.

884
01:28:43,916 --> 01:28:46,879
- Dr. Bauer, you wanted to speak to me? - Yes, come.

885
01:28:54,208 --> 01:28:56,009
Everything OK?

886
01:28:58,250 --> 01:29:01,509
I haven't seen you all week.

887
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:08,960
- I had personal obligations. - Aha.

888
01:29:10,208 --> 01:29:13,170
I would like you to accompany me to the Prime Minister.

889
01:29:15,083 --> 01:29:19,835
Zinn negotiated with the German government about Eichmannâs extradition.

890
01:29:50,958 --> 01:29:52,380
Fritz.

891
01:29:52,833 --> 01:29:57,470
- Where has Rosa Luxemburg gone? - You notice everything, too.

892
01:29:58,625 --> 01:30:00,841
This is prosecutor Angermann.

893
01:30:01,166 --> 01:30:03,584
- Very pleased. - Mr. Prime Minister.

894
01:30:03,875 --> 01:30:05,712
- You're welcome. - Thank you.

895
01:30:07,250 --> 01:30:10,379
Congratulations, Fritz. And to you too, Mr. Angermann.

896
01:30:10,625 --> 01:30:15,757
- The other prosecutors must be impressed. - Yes, by the Mossad.

897
01:30:17,083 --> 01:30:19,465
And thatâs how it should stay.

898
01:30:20,166 --> 01:30:22,216
Of course, I understand.

899
01:30:22,541 --> 01:30:27,590
- Can I offer you something to drink? Today is a reason to celebrate, isn't it? - No, thanks.

900
01:30:28,208 --> 01:30:30,507
What did the government decide?

901
01:30:33,291 --> 01:30:34,583
Please.

902
01:30:36,208 --> 01:30:40,614
I'm sorry, but the Federal Government will not request extradition.

903
01:30:42,375 --> 01:30:45,551
- Eichmann goes on trial in Israel - Wait a minute.

904
01:30:45,833 --> 01:30:51,794
The Israelis promised me. Chaim Cohn supports the extradition request.

905
01:30:52,583 --> 01:30:55,084
Cohn is just a lawyer, Fritz.

906
01:30:55,541 --> 01:30:57,923
- There's more to this. - Indeed.

907
01:30:58,500 --> 01:31:03,086
Don't you know why Ben-Gurion and Adenauer met in New York?

908
01:31:03,333 --> 01:31:06,462
Israel wants to buy German weapons; they discussed this in New York.

909
01:31:06,875 --> 01:31:11,840
Germany will only supply weapons if Eichmann goes on trial in Jerusalem.

910
01:31:12,166 --> 01:31:16,338
They are very nervous in Bonn, especially Mr. Globke, of course.

911
01:31:17,583 --> 01:31:21,920
Nobody is interested in a crisis in the federal government except the Soviets.

912
01:31:22,250 --> 01:31:26,303
That is why the US will do everything to protect Adenauerâs government.

913
01:31:26,583 --> 01:31:29,545
And the Israelis need German weapons.

914
01:31:29,916 --> 01:31:31,421
Here...

915
01:31:34,791 --> 01:31:37,173
The rejection from the Ministry of Justice.

916
01:31:52,583 --> 01:31:54,800
I told you, George.

917
01:31:55,625 --> 01:32:00,590
If I don't get Eichmann, I won't have the strength to go on.

918
01:32:00,958 --> 01:32:05,379
But you got him, you brought Eichmann down. That's your success.

919
01:32:05,708 --> 01:32:07,877
No! It's Israel's success.

920
01:32:08,208 --> 01:32:12,084
It would have been mine if Eichmann had been tried in a German court

921
01:32:12,375 --> 01:32:17,672
all the Nazis who today lead this republic as war profiteers.

922
01:32:18,625 --> 01:32:21,172
Other opportunities will come.

923
01:32:24,833 --> 01:32:26,717
But not for me anymore.

924
01:32:55,875 --> 01:32:58,553
Where should we go, Dr. Bauer?

925
01:33:06,750 --> 01:33:09,002
Dr. Bauer?

926
01:33:16,666 --> 01:33:18,918
What do you want to do now, Fritz?

927
01:33:28,416 --> 01:33:30,502
What do you want to do?

928
01:33:34,291 --> 01:33:38,103
I think I will resign from office.

929
01:33:39,333 --> 01:33:42,130
You must not do that. You must not do that.

930
01:33:50,625 --> 01:33:53,587
Vogel and KÃ¼gler are onto something here.

931
01:33:55,583 --> 01:33:57,917
Have you heard of the Breslau Documents?

932
01:33:59,958 --> 01:34:04,295
These are reports from camp commandant HÃ¶ss from Auschwitz.

933
01:34:05,791 --> 01:34:08,885
In it he lists SS men and their victims.

934
01:34:10,708 --> 01:34:15,543
Concrete actions, confirmed by the camp commandant, you understand?

935
01:34:16,583 --> 01:34:22,612
We could bring Auschwitz to justice. A cross-section of the entire camp.

936
01:34:24,583 --> 01:34:25,922
But

937
01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:30,131
But I don't believe in it anymore.

938
01:34:30,666 --> 01:34:33,297
They always find a way to stop us.

939
01:34:49,083 --> 01:34:51,417
Stop. Stop!

940
01:34:56,250 --> 01:35:00,472
- Are you getting off here? - Yes. I have to.

941
01:35:01,541 --> 01:35:03,627
I have to get out now.

942
01:35:07,541 --> 01:35:10,504
Don't give up, Fritz. Please.

943
01:35:40,958 --> 01:35:42,546
Karl!

944
01:36:01,125 --> 01:36:03,293
Come along with me.

945
01:36:38,275 --> 01:36:39,719
Herein.

946
01:36:40,583 --> 01:36:44,636
- Chief Public Prosecutor Kreidler. - Should appear.

947
01:36:45,625 --> 01:36:49,168
- Dr. Bauer, you wanted to speak to me? - Yes.

948
01:36:50,583 --> 01:36:53,926
Are you taking over the Angermann case personally?

949
01:36:54,375 --> 01:36:55,666
Secure.

950
01:36:56,041 --> 01:36:57,795
That has to be done.

951
01:36:58,125 --> 01:37:02,841
A prosecutor who goes against our system like this deserves to be treated fairly, don't you think?

952
01:37:04,291 --> 01:37:06,259
Is this a problem for you?

953
01:37:06,750 --> 01:37:08,835
I hear you were very close?

954
01:37:10,333 --> 01:37:12,502
You should note

955
01:37:12,750 --> 01:37:17,585
that he personally reported his indecency with this boy.

956
01:37:18,041 --> 01:37:19,712
Yes, of couse.

957
01:37:22,291 --> 01:37:24,922
He's the sweetheart of your young guard, isn't he?

958
01:37:28,708 --> 01:37:31,042
Are you biased in this affair?

959
01:37:31,500 --> 01:37:35,553
No, Kreidler. Do your job.

960
01:37:37,958 --> 01:37:38,918
Yes.

961
01:37:39,375 --> 01:37:41,508
But be sure:

962
01:37:41,916 --> 01:37:44,085
I will do mine.

963
01:37:45,625 --> 01:37:47,592
As long as I live,

964
01:37:48,083 --> 01:37:50,501
Nobody can stop me from doing that anymore.
