2
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,959
Comrade, get up we are in Hong Kong.

3
00:03:41,673 --> 00:03:43,984
Dear Xiao-ting, Finally I've arrived.

4
00:03:44,774 --> 00:03:48,416
Hong Kong is very far away from home.
Everything is so different from Wusih

5
00:03:49,044 --> 00:03:53,755
Lots of cars, lots of people,
and lots of pick-pockets too.

6
00:03:54,912 --> 00:03:57,519
The Cantonese speak loudly and rude.

7
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:01,027
Xiao-ting. I Already miss you.

8
00:04:06,751 --> 00:04:07,729
What do you want?

9
00:04:07,918 --> 00:04:09,921
Is Ms. Li There?

10
00:04:10,618 --> 00:04:13,429
A Mainlander! You want a hooker?

11
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,029
Girls! Customer at the door...

12
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,170
I am looking for my aunt.

13
00:04:27,626 --> 00:04:28,936
Can somebody speak Mandarin?

14
00:04:31,462 --> 00:04:34,774
There are lots of foreigners
here. Speaking languages unknown.

15
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:37,841
Even Chinese Cantonese.
I still don't have a clue.

16
00:04:38,431 --> 00:04:43,143
It is so foreign. With
the exception of aunt.

17
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:46,913
She speaks Mandarin.

18
00:04:49,771 --> 00:04:53,310
Aunt is very nice. She gave
me a room, all to myself.

19
00:04:53,472 --> 00:04:56,716
It's got great view.
And even my own toilet.

20
00:04:56,873 --> 00:05:00,823
So I don't have to go out to pee at
night. It's so much better than home.

21
00:05:01,976 --> 00:05:05,117
Everything is fine here,
don't worry about me.

22
00:05:23,386 --> 00:05:27,598
Hong Kong people are weird. It
seems they don't need to work.

23
00:05:27,688 --> 00:05:32,104
They wake up late in the morning.
Dress up and go out for fun every night.

24
00:05:32,991 --> 00:05:35,403
Aunt told me that...

25
00:05:35,691 --> 00:05:39,607
Don't call me aunt. Call me Rosie.

26
00:05:40,693 --> 00:05:42,138
Rosie.

27
00:05:42,794 --> 00:05:44,502
Right. Come in.

28
00:05:54,732 --> 00:05:57,544
Wear this for the job interview.

29
00:05:58,734 --> 00:06:03,846
The way you dress. The cops will
send you back across the border.

30
00:06:03,937 --> 00:06:04,848
Thank you.

31
00:06:04,938 --> 00:06:09,354
Be careful. Take this to
dry-clean on your 1st pay-day.

32
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:12,580
One day, he'll come back for it.

33
00:06:13,074 --> 00:06:14,075
You mean uncle?

34
00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:16,548
William.

35
00:06:19,577 --> 00:06:21,649
You two are a bit a like.

36
00:06:22,044 --> 00:06:24,993
Rosie, the delivery is
here, where is your purse?

37
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:33,661
William H.

38
00:06:36,451 --> 00:06:37,760
For God's sake.

39
00:06:37,785 --> 00:06:40,893
This is only a butcher shop.
Why are you all dressed up.

40
00:06:40,987 --> 00:06:45,563
I'll take him to buy
some cheap clothings.

41
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:51,336
Alright, come to work at 6 in the
morning. That's our busiest hours.

42
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:54,603
By the way. Teach this
Hick some Cantonese.

43
00:06:54,727 --> 00:06:56,434
Got you! Thanks a lot.

44
00:06:56,593 --> 00:06:57,595
Let's go.

45
00:06:57,795 --> 00:06:58,499
Thank you.

46
00:06:58,594 --> 00:06:59,904
Go!

47
00:07:00,429 --> 00:07:04,709
Your Aunt really loves you,
giving you Boozer's suit and all.

48
00:07:05,332 --> 00:07:07,813
Watch where you going.

49
00:07:07,898 --> 00:07:11,905
God damn cab driver. You deserve
to be a cab driver for life.

50
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,847
And for your next lives too!

51
00:07:14,936 --> 00:07:18,510
Forget it. What Boozer? It's William.

52
00:07:18,603 --> 00:07:22,553
What William? Your Aunt was
crazy about William Holden.

53
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:27,021
So one night, she picked up a Boozer on the street
and told everybody that he was William Holden.

54
00:07:27,308 --> 00:07:31,417
You understand me. She's nuts.

55
00:07:33,811 --> 00:07:36,851
Dear Xiao-ting. I've found a job.

56
00:07:37,012 --> 00:07:39,858
In the transportation business It's
very laid back and it pays good.

57
00:07:40,047 --> 00:07:44,429
I make around $ 2,000 a month,
Plus bonus. Are you proud of me?

58
00:07:44,816 --> 00:07:46,887
I'm making more money
than the mayor of Tientsin.

59
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:05,967
I work on the streets a lot. Especially
Tsimshatsul, I know the area by heart,

60
00:08:06,259 --> 00:08:08,501
Tsimshatsui is where
all the happenings are.

61
00:08:14,663 --> 00:08:20,274
I'm a little soldier. I came from
the peasants. I kick Japanese ass.

62
00:08:37,873 --> 00:08:38,545
You're nuts.

63
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:44,288
Learning Cantonese
is vital in Hong Kong.

64
00:08:44,376 --> 00:08:48,520
But even after I've Learnt it. I still don't
get much of what people said on the street.

65
00:09:13,922 --> 00:09:18,874
Xiao Ting. Tomorrow is my pay
day. I'll buy you a present.

66
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:23,165
And I will go to a place where
Wusih people have never been.

67
00:09:46,437 --> 00:09:47,473
Can I help somebody here?

68
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:50,579
Can I take your order sir?

69
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:56,385
Ham... Hamburger.

70
00:09:58,976 --> 00:09:59,852
Anything else?

71
00:10:00,777 --> 00:10:04,955
Ke kou... ke... ke kou ke... Co... Co...

72
00:10:06,246 --> 00:10:06,850
Coke.

73
00:10:06,947 --> 00:10:07,948
Yes! Coke!

74
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,860
For here or to go?

75
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:21,864
Eat here or take home?

76
00:10:23,555 --> 00:10:24,362
Eat here!

77
00:10:31,058 --> 00:10:33,665
Help wanted

78
00:10:39,761 --> 00:10:41,070
Thank you, five dollars
and sixty cents please.

79
00:10:41,496 --> 00:10:42,600
Five dollars and sixty cents.

80
00:11:00,304 --> 00:11:02,615
Alright. Next please.

81
00:11:03,606 --> 00:11:04,710
Excuse me...

82
00:11:06,206 --> 00:11:08,620
Manager, someone wants to
talk to you. Step aside please.

83
00:11:08,742 --> 00:11:09,517
Can I help you?

84
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:12,317
- ¿How are you?
- ¿You want a job?

85
00:11:12,643 --> 00:11:16,422
¿You speak Cantonese?

86
00:11:18,446 --> 00:11:19,619
A little bit.

87
00:11:19,946 --> 00:11:20,823
How about English?

88
00:11:24,349 --> 00:11:24,918
Not really.

89
00:11:25,249 --> 00:11:26,729
Leave your name and phone number.

90
00:11:43,558 --> 00:11:45,834
This is my name and phone number.

91
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,768
I can't find the manager.

92
00:11:51,094 --> 00:11:51,868
Please.

93
00:11:53,662 --> 00:11:54,470
Thank you.

94
00:12:04,367 --> 00:12:05,472
You from the Mainland?

95
00:12:05,867 --> 00:12:07,609
Yes, how do you know?

96
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,409
By your Cantonese! It's awful!

97
00:12:11,303 --> 00:12:13,215
You'll have trouble not
knowing English in Hong Kong.

98
00:12:13,671 --> 00:12:15,811
I know, but what can I do.

99
00:12:17,406 --> 00:12:21,379
There are many schools in Hong
Kong... Do you understand me?

100
00:12:21,475 --> 00:12:22,477
aa aaaa

101
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:26,591
Schools that tutor English
specifically to Mainlanders.

102
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:28,985
Actually English is easy.

103
00:12:30,812 --> 00:12:32,314
You from the Mainland too?

104
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:35,585
Of course not! I speak fluent Cantonese!

105
00:12:35,681 --> 00:12:38,390
But you speak good Mandarin too.

106
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:43,730
People who speak Mandarin may not be Mainlanders, but...
those who don't speak Cantonese are certainly Mainlanders.

107
00:12:43,784 --> 00:12:44,889
Want to learn English?

108
00:12:46,819 --> 00:12:48,231
Can I have this?

109
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,160
You want this?

110
00:12:49,254 --> 00:12:50,665
Yes, It's nice paper.

111
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:55,669
I can write letters home on it. There
aren't any McDonald's in Wusih yet.

112
00:12:56,156 --> 00:12:57,431
I'll get you some new ones.

113
00:12:57,524 --> 00:12:58,525
Thank you.

114
00:13:01,426 --> 00:13:04,340
Now do you want to learn English?

115
00:13:04,527 --> 00:13:06,769
Can I work here if I knew English?

116
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:11,244
You can work any where
if you know English.

117
00:13:11,763 --> 00:13:14,644
But I don't want to work anywhere else.

118
00:13:17,133 --> 00:13:20,377
Whatever. Now do you want
to learn English or not!

119
00:13:25,836 --> 00:13:27,748
$ 100 for registration.

120
00:13:28,138 --> 00:13:29,879
But I only have fifty dollars.

121
00:13:32,572 --> 00:13:34,143
Do you have an ATM card?
(NR. Tarjeta Bancaria)

122
00:13:35,342 --> 00:13:36,342
What's that?

123
00:13:38,242 --> 00:13:39,950
It's a card for cash withdrawal.

124
00:13:40,677 --> 00:13:43,556
You put it into the computer.
The computer spits out the money.

125
00:13:43,644 --> 00:13:44,554
Spar?

126
00:13:44,645 --> 00:13:45,555
So you have it?

127
00:13:45,645 --> 00:13:46,454
That's amazing.

128
00:13:46,545 --> 00:13:47,524
If you don't have it,

129
00:13:49,215 --> 00:13:51,525
Better apply one, it's real handy.

130
00:13:52,115 --> 00:13:55,223
I'll go pull some strings,
you pay fifty dollars today.

131
00:13:55,384 --> 00:14:00,734
When you come to class next week,
you pay the $500 balance, OK?

132
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,696
Thank you.

133
00:14:04,021 --> 00:14:04,830
How are you?

134
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:11,395
Hey, china girl.

135
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:15,096
Making money from your own people again.

136
00:14:15,393 --> 00:14:18,841
He's not my own people, he's from
the north. He speaks Mandarin.

137
00:14:21,329 --> 00:14:22,604
That's correct.

138
00:14:23,595 --> 00:14:27,545
$500 is a real bargain.
Text books included.

139
00:14:27,798 --> 00:14:30,109
Thank you. Do you know her?

140
00:14:30,532 --> 00:14:32,138
I work part-time here.

141
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,504
Part time?

142
00:14:36,135 --> 00:14:37,343
That's a pager!

143
00:14:37,636 --> 00:14:42,748
A pager! You are incredible. You're
the 1st pager owner I've ever talked to.

144
00:14:46,505 --> 00:14:48,680
Alright, have a nice life!

145
00:14:49,242 --> 00:14:51,052
Good bye.

146
00:15:09,151 --> 00:15:09,993
How are you?

147
00:15:14,753 --> 00:15:17,258
I'm fine, thank you.

148
00:15:33,561 --> 00:15:37,068
Just Kidding. My name is Jeremy.

149
00:15:37,763 --> 00:15:40,176
My girl friend calls me "Jamie".

150
00:15:40,198 --> 00:15:42,372
"Jamie".

151
00:15:43,066 --> 00:15:44,170
Isn't that a girl's name?

152
00:15:44,667 --> 00:15:48,913
No, Jamie can either a be a guy or a girl.
You must have mistaken Jamie for Jenny.

153
00:15:49,035 --> 00:15:50,036
"Jenny".

154
00:15:55,305 --> 00:15:57,945
Jump you son of bitch! Jump.

155
00:16:00,539 --> 00:16:03,613
Jump you son of bitch! Jump.

156
00:16:06,042 --> 00:16:08,319
You go to hell

157
00:16:11,112 --> 00:16:13,320
You go to hell

158
00:16:15,947 --> 00:16:17,449
We go to hell

159
00:16:19,615 --> 00:16:21,221
I go to hell

160
00:16:37,723 --> 00:16:38,463
Hello.

161
00:16:39,025 --> 00:16:41,733
Class is over, go home.

162
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:44,232
I am Li Xiao-jun.

163
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,062
I remember you.

164
00:16:46,861 --> 00:16:47,669
Let's go.

165
00:16:49,162 --> 00:16:50,469
Are you in a hurry?

166
00:16:51,863 --> 00:16:54,538
Yes, very much. Common, hurry up.

167
00:16:54,664 --> 00:16:58,374
Do you want a ride?

168
00:16:58,465 --> 00:17:01,607
- Do you drive?
- Well, let's go then! Hurry up.

169
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:18,616
You know? In Hong Kong, People here
don't offer a ride on a bicycle.

170
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:22,386
I feel like I'm back in Wusih.

171
00:17:24,278 --> 00:17:25,689
You are heavier than my girlfriend.

172
00:18:55,486 --> 00:18:58,833
Writing home?

173
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:01,593
Home?

174
00:19:05,124 --> 00:19:06,431
Girlfriend.

175
00:19:07,092 --> 00:19:09,039
I don't understand.

176
00:19:15,194 --> 00:19:17,403
She's beautiful.

177
00:19:23,398 --> 00:19:25,038
Father, mother.

178
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,441
Writing love letter?

179
00:19:30,301 --> 00:19:34,308
Once you've learned English,
write to William for me.

180
00:19:35,404 --> 00:19:36,405
Sure

181
00:19:38,237 --> 00:19:40,914
William again? He died
ages ago. Come on...

182
00:20:15,155 --> 00:20:17,534
Why do they call me Uncle China?

183
00:20:17,623 --> 00:20:20,538
They should call you a Hick.

184
00:20:20,925 --> 00:20:23,964
Well, I prefer people calling me uncle.

185
00:20:25,027 --> 00:20:29,170
Can you drop these on the way? It's
urgent. And keep then away from the chicken.

186
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:30,236
I am in a hurry too.

187
00:20:30,328 --> 00:20:32,937
So stop talking and start moving.

188
00:20:36,465 --> 00:20:42,246
Actually all Hong Kong people came from the
Mainland. Their ancestors were Uncle Chinese too!

189
00:20:45,069 --> 00:20:46,376
Great meal.

190
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:52,512
The way you eat, you must be ready for loads of
work. Let's start delivery 2 hours earlier tomorrow.

191
00:20:54,407 --> 00:20:57,389
OK. It's getting more and more everyday.

192
00:20:57,574 --> 00:21:00,215
Go, I'll pay you, I'll
pay you for the gas.

193
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:01,684
Bicycle doesn't need gas.

194
00:21:02,376 --> 00:21:05,085
How come you know everything.
Were you a starlight a student?

195
00:21:05,211 --> 00:21:08,386
How come you know nothing?
What do you do at your leisure?

196
00:21:13,281 --> 00:21:14,191
Which ones are triple X.

197
00:21:14,281 --> 00:21:16,388
This, this...

198
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:19,190
And this.

199
00:21:19,484 --> 00:21:24,698
Four for a week. This is better than basketball.
Help me with the delivery, you'll get 5 next week.

200
00:21:25,421 --> 00:21:27,698
Why are you available all the
time? don't you have friends.

201
00:21:28,087 --> 00:21:31,093
You are my friend. You
have no friend, too.

202
00:21:31,289 --> 00:21:35,706
I have many friends if I want. If I have
time, I would rather make more money.

203
00:21:35,992 --> 00:21:38,097
Please enter your
personal secret number.

204
00:21:45,496 --> 00:21:47,534
The balance amount $12.639,91

205
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:54,440
What are you looking at?
Never see a rich girl?

206
00:21:59,836 --> 00:22:00,975
Let's go.

207
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:02,650
How come you're so rich?

208
00:22:06,238 --> 00:22:08,551
None of your business!
How come you're so poor?

209
00:22:08,641 --> 00:22:10,382
That's really a lot of money!

210
00:22:10,942 --> 00:22:12,945
Let's go, get smart.

211
00:22:13,042 --> 00:22:14,146
How about teaching me?

212
00:22:14,242 --> 00:22:16,851
You have to be born with that talent.

213
00:22:17,644 --> 00:22:20,958
Chinese New Year's Eve 1987

214
00:22:28,048 --> 00:22:30,051
Where did you get so many coins?

215
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:31,858
The bank, of course!
Idiot! After dinner,

216
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:35,199
After dinner, the customers
will come pouring down.

217
00:22:36,252 --> 00:22:39,964
Look at you, a young entrepreneur.

218
00:22:41,088 --> 00:22:45,561
You have a share too. Rather
small share though, only $1.000

219
00:22:45,957 --> 00:22:51,535
But, my aunt said, only Mainlanders
love Teresa Tang's songs.

220
00:22:52,225 --> 00:22:56,540
That's exactly the point.

221
00:22:56,829 --> 00:22:58,536
You know how many Mainlanders
are there in Hong Kong?

222
00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:03,511
The paper said 20% of Hong Kong population
is Mainlander. They are all over.

223
00:23:03,798 --> 00:23:05,904
They are just not
recognizable, unlike you.

224
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:11,614
For example, between you
and me, 50% is Mainlander.

225
00:23:12,335 --> 00:23:13,245
You've got a point.

226
00:23:13,436 --> 00:23:15,917
Comrade Li Xiao-jun, we're
gonna make a lot of money.

227
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,952
Golden songs from Teresa
Tang, just $28, cassette tape.

228
00:23:29,042 --> 00:23:32,024
Forty dollars for record.

229
00:23:32,311 --> 00:23:37,524
Rain or shine, you
gotta buy Teresa Tang.

230
00:23:37,814 --> 00:23:39,418
Buy Teresa Tang, and safe it for rainy
days. Teresa Tang's greatest hits!

231
00:23:39,614 --> 00:23:41,151
Do you have Alan Tam's greatest hits?

232
00:23:41,248 --> 00:23:42,124
No.

233
00:23:42,316 --> 00:23:43,920
Let's go.

234
00:23:45,017 --> 00:23:48,762
The best of Teresa Tang, great price.

235
00:23:48,852 --> 00:23:54,098
A real bargain, never before.

236
00:23:54,187 --> 00:23:57,261
Prettiest voice in China. Your for $28

237
00:23:57,856 --> 00:23:59,494
Teresa Tang's golden hits.

238
00:24:14,464 --> 00:24:19,380
Come get it while stock last.

239
00:24:19,465 --> 00:24:20,810
It's hot.

240
00:24:25,002 --> 00:24:31,115
So many customers on the
other side. Such a long line.

241
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:33,476
Let's sell milk next year.

242
00:24:41,375 --> 00:24:43,982
Lunar New Year's Eve
last year in Guangzhou,

243
00:24:45,211 --> 00:24:48,660
My cousin and I sold 4.000 cassettes.

244
00:24:49,046 --> 00:24:54,761
Aunt said if you are a fan of Teresa Tang
everyone will think you're a Mainlander.

245
00:24:55,115 --> 00:24:57,118
So people won't buy the
cassettes even if they're fans.

246
00:24:59,451 --> 00:25:01,158
You said you were in Guangzhou?

247
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,930
Last year I was.

248
00:25:09,022 --> 00:25:10,831
So was the year before,... and before.

249
00:25:13,157 --> 00:25:14,932
But not this year.

250
00:25:19,259 --> 00:25:20,864
I came from Guangzhou.

251
00:25:26,363 --> 00:25:29,174
I knew it! We are comrades.

252
00:25:29,331 --> 00:25:33,338
No way! We speak Cantonese.

253
00:25:34,334 --> 00:25:39,445
We get Hong Kong TV. we are
so much closer to Hong Kong.

254
00:25:43,738 --> 00:25:46,879
Right, your look, your gesture

255
00:25:47,005 --> 00:25:49,919
your face, your hair are so Hong Kong.

256
00:25:50,974 --> 00:25:52,318
You're just pulling my legs.

257
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:59,883
Better than you, using
me the whole time.

258
00:26:04,112 --> 00:26:06,115
So, why didn't you stop me?

259
00:26:08,915 --> 00:26:13,093
Had I stopped you, you probably wouldn't be
my friend. Besides, I've got nothing to do.

260
00:26:14,184 --> 00:26:16,791
I don't want to lose my
only friend in Hong Kong.

261
00:26:23,389 --> 00:26:25,835
Actually you're my only friend too!

262
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:54,740
Last lunar New Year, I stayed over in Xiao
- ting's place.

263
00:26:55,336 --> 00:26:59,184
It was late. We were hungry.
We made dumplings together.

264
00:26:59,338 --> 00:27:03,151
The dumplings were yummy. You know,
Wusih people love eating dumplings.

265
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,752
I am full, I can't eat any more.

266
00:27:35,688 --> 00:27:39,399
It's a nice place. Isn't it noisy?

267
00:27:42,358 --> 00:27:43,302
Not really.

268
00:27:44,593 --> 00:27:45,696
Let's clean up.

269
00:27:56,631 --> 00:27:58,305
The rain has stopped.

270
00:28:00,533 --> 00:28:02,605
Give me some water.

271
00:28:19,908 --> 00:28:21,217
Your hands are so cold.

272
00:28:21,808 --> 00:28:25,315
Really? I am leaving.

273
00:28:26,612 --> 00:28:28,113
I'll get you a coat.

274
00:28:37,016 --> 00:28:37,960
I am sorry.

275
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:40,319
It's alright.

276
00:29:07,762 --> 00:29:09,868
No, it's enough.

277
00:29:10,063 --> 00:29:11,771
It's cold out there.

278
00:29:25,271 --> 00:29:27,013
So ugly.

279
00:31:28,294 --> 00:31:31,174
Hong Kong calling Fang Xiao-ting.

280
00:31:31,895 --> 00:31:33,000
Xiao-ting?

281
00:31:33,896 --> 00:31:37,277
Xiao Jun, I've waited for
your call. Have you had lunch.

282
00:31:37,563 --> 00:31:42,982
I was thinking about you
last night. Is everything OK?

283
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:46,539
It's a bad connection.

284
00:31:46,602 --> 00:31:48,605
I've got the stuff you sent me.

285
00:31:49,136 --> 00:31:53,018
The sweater you knitted...
I am wearing now.

286
00:31:53,105 --> 00:31:56,111
Really? But I can't see it.

287
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,218
Xiao-ting.

288
00:31:57,706 --> 00:31:58,742
What is it?

289
00:32:01,242 --> 00:32:02,221
I love you.

290
00:32:03,042 --> 00:32:04,920
What are you saying?

291
00:32:10,545 --> 00:32:15,122
It's lunar new year.
Got to say it again.

292
00:32:46,595 --> 00:32:51,068
Sausage McMuffin, it's new on the
menu. Buy two get one teddy bear free.

293
00:32:52,965 --> 00:32:56,881
I'll get you a half dozen,
send them home to your folks.

294
00:33:06,471 --> 00:33:07,280
What's the matter?

295
00:33:09,872 --> 00:33:13,185
The money you owe... I
think I should help out.

296
00:33:13,807 --> 00:33:15,685
Take it back, please!

297
00:33:15,875 --> 00:33:17,479
I'll take my responsibility.

298
00:33:17,609 --> 00:33:18,817
What responsibility?

299
00:33:20,078 --> 00:33:25,529
The money you owe. Will get you in
trouble. They're loan-sharks, you know?

300
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,085
Don't worry about me.

301
00:33:28,615 --> 00:33:33,293
I've found a buyer today. Eight dollars
per cassette. He's gonna take it all.

302
00:33:34,017 --> 00:33:36,520
Eight dollars each?
You're gonna loose a lot.

303
00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:38,194
Of course.

304
00:33:38,286 --> 00:33:39,696
So why are you selling?

305
00:33:40,021 --> 00:33:44,130
What else can I do? It's
better than total loss.

306
00:33:44,688 --> 00:33:47,431
That's life! No pain, no gain.

307
00:33:47,622 --> 00:33:50,537
But I'll be better next time.

308
00:33:59,528 --> 00:34:01,032
Last night...

309
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:04,533
Do we have to talk about it?

310
00:34:08,933 --> 00:34:10,880
I don't know what it was last night.

311
00:34:11,934 --> 00:34:15,884
Last night... it was rainy cold.

312
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:20,151
We were two lonely people
keeping each other warm.

313
00:34:26,108 --> 00:34:27,985
Did you call home?

314
00:34:29,775 --> 00:34:30,777
Yes.

315
00:34:35,111 --> 00:34:38,060
Go home. You have to work tomorrow.

316
00:34:47,583 --> 00:34:48,561
Li Chiao.

317
00:34:50,418 --> 00:34:51,396
Happy new year.

318
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:53,057
Prosperity.

319
00:34:53,486 --> 00:34:54,522
To happiness.

320
00:34:56,388 --> 00:34:57,059
To money.

321
00:34:57,121 --> 00:34:57,929
To longevity.

322
00:34:58,089 --> 00:34:58,999
To a jackpot.

323
00:34:59,089 --> 00:34:59,726
To good health.

324
00:34:59,822 --> 00:35:00,492
To a Mercedes.

325
00:35:00,923 --> 00:35:02,561
To a better life.

326
00:35:05,691 --> 00:35:07,036
To... friendship.

327
00:35:41,608 --> 00:35:42,849
Who was that?

328
00:35:42,942 --> 00:35:44,820
Sir Jeremy. You knows him.

329
00:35:45,077 --> 00:35:47,387
I meant the girl.

330
00:35:47,643 --> 00:35:51,593
Oh, she is Cabbage, my
neighbour. She is a hooker.

331
00:35:51,981 --> 00:35:53,516
You're rude to call her that.

332
00:35:54,647 --> 00:35:56,355
But that's what she is.

333
00:35:57,048 --> 00:35:58,494
Dear Xiao-ting.

334
00:35:58,549 --> 00:36:02,693
Lately, I... I Have...

335
00:36:04,886 --> 00:36:07,389
Dear Xiao-ting, I...

336
00:36:11,055 --> 00:36:13,365
Jeremy is going steady with Cabbage.

337
00:36:13,455 --> 00:36:14,365
How do you know?

338
00:36:14,789 --> 00:36:16,099
They go to the love motel all the time.

339
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:17,593
That doesn't mean they're going steady.

340
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:19,225
But even if they are, so what?

341
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,072
But Cabbage is a hooker!

342
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:22,096
##################################################

343
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,828
But she makes more money than you!

344
00:36:24,496 --> 00:36:24,496
##################################################

345
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:31,287
Why all your bras are so hard?

346
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:34,157
Cause I am big.

347
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:37,241
Why do you wear swimming
trunk instead of underwear?

348
00:36:21,494 --> 00:36:21,494
##################################################

349
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,750
Dear Xiao-ting,

350
00:36:53,323 --> 00:36:58,741
Dear Xiao-ting. I have been busty lately. And
I have not been writing much. Don't get mad.

351
00:36:59,092 --> 00:37:04,043
I'm senior now at the English class.
And I've been promoted at work.

352
00:37:04,194 --> 00:37:05,730
Everything is fine.
Don't worry about me.

353
00:37:30,006 --> 00:37:33,217
I've just made a new friend. He's
going to make me a junior chef.

354
00:37:33,308 --> 00:37:37,553
A chef can earn a lot of money.

355
00:37:37,809 --> 00:37:40,256
A chef in Hong Kong can earn
over ten thousand a month.

356
00:37:40,343 --> 00:37:44,259
Xiao-ting. I thing I'm one lucky guy.

357
00:37:45,412 --> 00:37:48,793
Wrong again, can't you
remember the pin number?

358
00:37:51,748 --> 00:37:52,955
"TRY AGAIN"

359
00:37:59,952 --> 00:38:03,366
This is the third and
the last try. You sure?

360
00:38:06,889 --> 00:38:09,166
Your card retained,
please contact the bank.

361
00:38:10,257 --> 00:38:12,260
I told you.

362
00:38:13,092 --> 00:38:17,701
It's gone now move over, it's my turn.

363
00:38:18,394 --> 00:38:19,964
Come on, cheer up.

364
00:38:22,262 --> 00:38:24,368
It's no big deal,
just apply for new one.

365
00:38:24,463 --> 00:38:25,498
How long would it take?

366
00:38:26,064 --> 00:38:28,067
The balance amount $32.639,91

367
00:38:29,465 --> 00:38:32,880
Bingo. People said Yen is rising.

368
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,709
Who is Yen?

369
00:38:35,069 --> 00:38:35,876
My brother.

370
00:38:37,069 --> 00:38:42,077
Get serious. Even the grandmas make
money off stocks and foreign exchange.

371
00:38:43,572 --> 00:38:46,314
Not the grandmas who
buy chicken from us.

372
00:38:47,107 --> 00:38:50,419
They just don't want to let you in on
it. Not everyone treats you as nice I do.

373
00:38:51,209 --> 00:38:56,320
You know? Stock and shares are national products of Hong
Kong. Just like oil in the Middle East. Durians in Thailand.

374
00:38:56,411 --> 00:38:58,153
If you want to be rich in Hong
Kong, you must buy stock and shares.

375
00:38:58,246 --> 00:38:59,248
Can you teach me?

376
00:38:59,312 --> 00:39:01,725
Teach you again? You've
drained all my knowledge.

377
00:39:34,128 --> 00:39:35,835
You line up to buy a new apartment?

378
00:39:36,262 --> 00:39:37,469
No, we are paid to line up
for the real estate agency.

379
00:39:37,729 --> 00:39:39,937
So are we?

380
00:39:41,831 --> 00:39:43,334
How much do they pay you?

381
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:46,670
Five thousand for a unit.

382
00:39:46,834 --> 00:39:50,943
Five thousand? We are
paid three thousand only.

383
00:39:51,936 --> 00:39:55,441
They're getting 2
thousand more per unit.

384
00:39:56,873 --> 00:39:58,546
Lucky, we are used to
lining up in the Mainland.

385
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:04,085
I guess they're all your
comrades here. Lots of training.

386
00:40:06,343 --> 00:40:09,382
See, a big fight over
2 thousand dollars.

387
00:40:10,243 --> 00:40:14,160
It's hot tonight. People are grouchy.

388
00:40:18,247 --> 00:40:23,393
I think they are stuck in a tiny apartment and fight
over bread and butter for the rest of their lives.

389
00:40:25,985 --> 00:40:28,466
Come bed-time, everything
will be alright.

390
00:40:29,087 --> 00:40:32,798
It takes a lot to come to Hong Kong. I'm
not gonna waste my life away like them.

391
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:37,468
Not everyone think as big as you do.

392
00:40:37,991 --> 00:40:42,566
What's wrong with thinking big.
People should have goals in life.

393
00:40:43,259 --> 00:40:44,898
I don't have any.

394
00:40:46,695 --> 00:40:51,009
Didn't you want to save enough money
And take your sweet-heart to Hong Kong.

395
00:40:53,197 --> 00:40:54,040
Is that a goal too?

396
00:40:54,298 --> 00:40:56,803
Sure it is. Just a bit petty.

397
00:40:58,133 --> 00:41:01,206
I'm glad I don't have
any sweetheart back home.

398
00:41:01,301 --> 00:41:05,342
If I were to marry a Mainlander.
What's the point of coming to Hong Kong.

399
00:41:12,306 --> 00:41:14,149
Li Xiao-jun.

400
00:41:15,307 --> 00:41:17,118
What's in your pants?

401
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:20,013
It's disgusting!

402
00:41:20,443 --> 00:41:22,754
Oh shit!

403
00:41:23,511 --> 00:41:27,120
It's chocolate. I bought this for you.

404
00:41:30,214 --> 00:41:33,425
Why are you so nice to me? It's a mess!

405
00:41:33,915 --> 00:41:35,121
How can I eat melted chocolate?

406
00:41:35,149 --> 00:41:36,026
It's still good.

407
00:41:36,116 --> 00:41:37,425
I don't want it.

408
00:41:39,019 --> 00:41:41,431
It melts after you eat it anyway.

409
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,862
Try some.

410
00:41:46,955 --> 00:41:48,060
Just a bit.

411
00:41:50,957 --> 00:41:53,302
The Heng Seng index
has reached 3600 today.

412
00:41:53,391 --> 00:41:58,065
Insider's tips say it's going over 4000
by the end of the year. It's time to buy.

413
00:41:58,161 --> 00:42:00,608
In a couple of years, I'll
line up for my own apartment.

414
00:42:02,263 --> 00:42:06,406
One in Hong Kong. One in China for mom.

415
00:42:07,397 --> 00:42:08,878
Keep dreaming.

416
00:42:09,465 --> 00:42:12,881
Why not? This is Hong Kong

417
00:42:13,167 --> 00:42:15,170
If you work at it,
anything is possible here.

418
00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:20,906
Li Xiao-jun, are we best friends?

419
00:42:21,905 --> 00:42:22,883
Sure.

420
00:42:25,172 --> 00:42:27,586
Through thick and thin,
you're always there for me.

421
00:42:30,408 --> 00:42:33,881
You are my best friend in Hong Kong.

422
00:42:34,811 --> 00:42:35,788
Thank you.

423
00:42:36,879 --> 00:42:38,881
Wow! English.

424
00:42:39,212 --> 00:42:40,214
Of course.

425
00:42:42,481 --> 00:42:43,790
I have enough.

426
00:42:44,882 --> 00:42:46,829
Just a little bit more.

427
00:42:47,215 --> 00:42:49,321
Alright just a tiny bit.

428
00:42:52,619 --> 00:42:54,257
Yak!

429
00:43:12,528 --> 00:43:17,478
Business is really bad lately. Even
the regulars at the restaurant are gone.

430
00:43:17,831 --> 00:43:19,469
The stock market crash
is killing everyone.

431
00:43:20,865 --> 00:43:23,176
The balance amount $ 89,91

432
00:44:00,582 --> 00:44:05,226
Usually customers start pouring in by
4 pm till right around 5 in the morning.

433
00:44:05,786 --> 00:44:10,202
It's tough in the beginning. Your hands are
so sore, you can't pick up the chopsticks.

434
00:44:10,788 --> 00:44:12,735
Get out of here!

435
00:44:13,188 --> 00:44:18,300
It's not a bad place to work considering the
tips and the clientele. Through the years.

436
00:44:19,091 --> 00:44:24,203
We see them girls came and go,
you get 20 dollars per hour.

437
00:44:24,394 --> 00:44:26,602
All tips go to you.

438
00:44:27,195 --> 00:44:29,540
How much tips you make?

439
00:44:30,197 --> 00:44:33,144
That depends on what
you're willing to do.

440
00:44:33,297 --> 00:44:36,108
And that's none of our business.

441
00:45:01,243 --> 00:45:06,194
Mr. Au-yeung. Fanny is on leave
today, I'll be you masseuse.

442
00:45:06,279 --> 00:45:07,759
My name is Chiao.

443
00:45:09,147 --> 00:45:10,491
Have you eaten?

444
00:45:11,348 --> 00:45:12,760
Yes, thank you.

445
00:45:13,783 --> 00:45:15,091
Full?

446
00:45:16,551 --> 00:45:17,461
Yes.

447
00:45:19,051 --> 00:45:22,661
So, you are charged up!
I love heavy massage.

448
00:45:23,353 --> 00:45:24,766
If you're not good enough,
I'll replace you. Don't you cry.

449
00:45:25,254 --> 00:45:27,098
I haven't cried for over twenty years.

450
00:45:33,692 --> 00:45:35,194
So, why do you have red eyes?

451
00:45:36,493 --> 00:45:39,167
Your gold watch is hurting my eyes.

452
00:45:41,361 --> 00:45:43,069
You have sharp tongue.

453
00:45:43,262 --> 00:45:45,539
My tongue is only good for
eating and telling jokes.

454
00:45:46,231 --> 00:45:50,648
I don't think so. There must be
other "job" your tongue can do.

455
00:45:55,301 --> 00:45:58,214
Boss, that asshole is
the superintendent's son.

456
00:45:58,737 --> 00:46:00,615
So bloody what? You chicken shit.

457
00:46:02,104 --> 00:46:03,209
Get lost.

458
00:46:04,606 --> 00:46:05,949
Why do you stop?

459
00:46:07,406 --> 00:46:10,446
Where are you going?

460
00:46:13,109 --> 00:46:15,716
I don't give a shit who
he is. Everybody pays.

461
00:46:17,211 --> 00:46:18,052
Chop him up.

462
00:46:23,514 --> 00:46:24,721
You wanna make a fat tip?

463
00:46:25,716 --> 00:46:28,128
Sure, you want me to
chop up somebody for you.

464
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:32,329
Very funny. I'm only interested
in what your tongue can do.

465
00:46:34,619 --> 00:46:38,228
I think you need somebody better for
the massage. I'll go get a replacement.

466
00:46:40,256 --> 00:46:44,330
You've got guts.
Aren't you scared of me?

467
00:46:44,558 --> 00:46:46,596
I'm scared of nothing. Except rats.

468
00:46:51,293 --> 00:46:54,002
Don't go. Just do my back.

469
00:46:58,097 --> 00:47:00,976
25, 26, 27...

470
00:47:00,997 --> 00:47:04,173
...28, 29

471
00:47:04,299 --> 00:47:06,679
How many chicken feet
do 18 chicken have?

472
00:47:10,969 --> 00:47:15,477
You sure? It should be 31!

473
00:47:22,275 --> 00:47:26,692
Why not try the chicken leg?
I made this specially for you.

474
00:47:27,076 --> 00:47:31,322
Chicken feet are good for your joints.
Since you use your fingers so much.

475
00:47:32,312 --> 00:47:34,919
I don't want it. I am tired.

476
00:47:36,581 --> 00:47:39,290
Let's pay the room for
the night and sleep over.

477
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:45,297
No, wake me in half and hour.

478
00:49:04,121 --> 00:49:08,093
I'd like to buy something on
Xiao-ting? Would you choose it for me?

479
00:49:09,022 --> 00:49:10,435
Her birthday is coming up.

480
00:49:12,290 --> 00:49:17,037
Look at the way we dressed!
They're going to look down on us.

481
00:49:17,092 --> 00:49:21,509
But I have money. I'm really buying.

482
00:49:22,029 --> 00:49:25,205
Yeah, Mr. Millionaire.
Alright, let's go in.

483
00:49:25,296 --> 00:49:27,902
Money in my pocket gives me confidence.

484
00:49:29,398 --> 00:49:30,571
How much is it?

485
00:49:30,599 --> 00:49:31,942
This is our treat.

486
00:49:32,999 --> 00:49:33,909
Thank you.

487
00:49:36,101 --> 00:49:37,410
Come on, it's free.

488
00:49:41,703 --> 00:49:43,412
I think this is the best.

489
00:49:46,306 --> 00:49:47,308
What are you doing?

490
00:49:48,207 --> 00:49:48,946
Nothing.

491
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:53,718
I know, your hands are sore. You
shouldn't do too many massage a day.

492
00:49:54,909 --> 00:49:57,220
What's wrong?

493
00:49:58,011 --> 00:49:58,921
He'll get this.

494
00:49:59,011 --> 00:49:59,955
Please wait.

495
00:50:02,913 --> 00:50:05,053
I don't want people to know what I do.

496
00:50:06,049 --> 00:50:10,124
You are not stealing. You are not
a hooker. What's wrong with your job?

497
00:50:11,117 --> 00:50:12,358
It's only massage.

498
00:50:13,151 --> 00:50:15,223
- You want this? Sir?
- Yeah.

499
00:50:19,621 --> 00:50:21,226
Any discount if I buy two?

500
00:50:22,022 --> 00:50:23,161
How about there?

501
00:50:23,322 --> 00:50:25,269
Fixed price, I am so sorry.

502
00:50:25,423 --> 00:50:28,633
Oh! Fixed price. I'll
buy two then. Thank you.

503
00:50:31,126 --> 00:50:33,266
Mr. Millionaire, buying
everything by the double.

504
00:50:33,427 --> 00:50:36,341
One for Xiao-ting, one for you.

505
00:50:43,666 --> 00:50:44,941
Looks good on you.

506
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:48,273
You like it.

507
00:50:50,202 --> 00:50:51,681
I have enough money! I do!

508
00:50:52,869 --> 00:50:54,179
I can afford it.

509
00:50:57,672 --> 00:50:59,085
I really can.

510
00:51:11,279 --> 00:51:14,285
Sorry, I've forgotten your fingers hurt

511
00:51:15,281 --> 00:51:20,324
Do you want to tell that whole world that I am
a massage girl? You want to put it in the paper?

512
00:51:21,883 --> 00:51:23,022
I am sorry.

513
00:51:25,319 --> 00:51:27,299
The bracelet looks fine on you.

514
00:51:28,986 --> 00:51:33,698
Wise up! How can you give the
same gift to 2 different woman,

515
00:51:34,621 --> 00:51:38,696
Xiao-ting and I are two different kinds of
women. She is your girl, I am you friend.

516
00:51:39,292 --> 00:51:44,140
Yes, we did sleep together, but... One for
her and one for me? What does that mean?!

517
00:51:44,793 --> 00:51:47,172
Do you know what you are doing?

518
00:51:52,529 --> 00:51:55,843
Don't be angry.

519
00:51:56,531 --> 00:52:01,244
Have you worked too
hard? Why don't you quit

520
00:52:01,934 --> 00:52:05,350
I'll moonlight to pay your debt.

521
00:52:06,237 --> 00:52:10,084
You said you want to marry
Xiao-ting, didn't you?

522
00:52:11,138 --> 00:52:13,141
Go back to Wuih to marry Xiao-ting.

523
00:52:13,973 --> 00:52:17,184
My dream is very different. We
are two different kinds of people.

524
00:52:26,145 --> 00:52:29,856
In fact, I don't know where I am
going, And I don't know what I am doing.

525
00:52:32,081 --> 00:52:34,790
I feel very insecure,
I hate that feeling.

526
00:52:37,583 --> 00:52:41,795
Few days ago, I called mom. I told her that
I was going to hit the jackpot in stock.

527
00:52:44,054 --> 00:52:47,832
But now, I am penny-less.
And I'm deep in debt.

528
00:52:51,724 --> 00:52:56,641
What have I done? I don't
know what will happen tomorrow!

529
00:52:57,492 --> 00:53:00,737
I am scared. I don't know what to do.

530
00:53:12,933 --> 00:53:17,611
If one day Xiao-ting meets
a man, they becomes friends,

531
00:53:19,036 --> 00:53:20,606
Just like you and me.

532
00:53:21,603 --> 00:53:26,021
They get together frequently,
and once in a while, they...

533
00:53:29,006 --> 00:53:34,220
But they keep telling themselves that they
are just friends. What would you think?

534
00:53:38,611 --> 00:53:39,554
I...

535
00:53:42,013 --> 00:53:43,152
I will be unhappy.

536
00:53:45,748 --> 00:53:47,387
Comrade Li Xiao-jun.

537
00:53:48,382 --> 00:53:53,163
You are not what brought me to Hong Kong.
And I am not what brought you to Hong Kong.

538
00:54:59,948 --> 00:55:01,019
I am tired.

539
00:55:01,149 --> 00:55:02,527
All moved in?

540
00:55:02,949 --> 00:55:03,927
No.

541
00:55:05,751 --> 00:55:07,560
Hey, don't forget to pay the rent.

542
00:55:08,518 --> 00:55:11,466
I've paid. Anytime.

543
00:55:28,761 --> 00:55:29,637
Pao.

544
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:37,439
I've brought a friend. I
heard you're scared of him.

545
00:55:48,670 --> 00:55:52,619
Why don't you laugh?
Aren't you in the mood?

546
00:55:54,272 --> 00:55:56,776
I am cheap I'll laugh
if you pay a big tip.

547
00:55:57,175 --> 00:56:01,591
You don't have to go through
all that just to make me laugh.

548
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:11,888
Go home and have a good sleep.

549
00:56:12,414 --> 00:56:16,489
Cool down. There won't be dead ends.

550
00:56:17,118 --> 00:56:18,597
Why?

551
00:56:18,617 --> 00:56:21,725
Why?

552
00:56:22,785 --> 00:56:24,198
Please don't!

553
00:56:45,164 --> 00:56:47,838
You tried today?

554
00:56:48,564 --> 00:56:51,546
Is somebody dead or
have you just got dumped?

555
00:56:52,265 --> 00:56:53,541
I'm broke!

556
00:56:53,767 --> 00:56:57,683
That's great. You wanna make a fat tip?

557
00:57:21,279 --> 00:57:22,588
Pager number please?

558
00:57:22,745 --> 00:57:23,747
1986 please.

559
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:25,285
Who's calling?

560
00:57:25,681 --> 00:57:26,854
Li Xiao-jun.

561
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:29,458
The message is...

562
00:57:31,151 --> 00:57:32,153
Good bye.

563
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:43,770
Dear Xiao-ting. I heard that there is a hot wave in
Hangchow recently. The heat even killed a couple of people.

564
00:57:43,857 --> 00:57:45,132
How is Wusih?

565
00:57:45,824 --> 00:57:50,501
Remember that summer? It
was hot. You were with me...

566
00:57:50,593 --> 00:57:54,907
Remember to wear warm clothes.
The weather is changing by the day.

567
00:57:55,029 --> 00:57:58,409
People said, this is the
coldest year in fifty years.

568
00:57:59,530 --> 00:58:04,812
Everybody is talking about migration
here. Mostly to Australia or Canada.

569
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:10,552
While Hong Kong is every Mainlander's dream.
Hong Kong people's dream is somewhere else.

570
00:58:11,502 --> 00:58:12,847
When I was small, my
parents always scolded me...

571
00:58:13,403 --> 00:58:16,011
Enclosed is the video of
Miss Hong Kong this year.

572
00:58:16,605 --> 00:58:21,022
I specially like the Winner, Anita
Yuen. She is sweet, just like you.

573
00:58:21,807 --> 00:58:24,721
But I think you are sweeter.

574
00:58:25,108 --> 00:58:27,954
Xiao-ting. I think this
should be my last letter.

575
00:58:29,011 --> 00:58:32,516
No? Next month we
would meet in Honk Kong.

576
00:58:49,987 --> 00:58:51,899
Jump you son of a bitch, jump.

577
00:58:52,886 --> 00:58:53,897
Your English is still awful.

578
00:58:53,989 --> 00:58:57,063
So what? As long as I make big money.

579
00:58:57,956 --> 00:59:00,062
Thank you for coming.
Please help yourself.

580
00:59:00,157 --> 00:59:02,968
This is my wife.

581
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:06,598
Congratulations.

582
00:59:06,795 --> 00:59:09,971
Have you seen Li Chiao? She opened
a florist and invests in property.

583
00:59:09,995 --> 00:59:13,500
She's now a boss of a big enterprise.

584
00:59:13,663 --> 00:59:14,164
I knew it.

585
00:59:14,464 --> 00:59:18,505
She worked over twenty hours a day.
She really worked hard for money.

586
00:59:18,666 --> 00:59:22,673
Remember she introduced us to the English
school? She got commission from that.

587
00:59:22,768 --> 00:59:24,908
So it was all a scheme!

588
00:59:24,969 --> 00:59:26,005
You didn't know?

589
00:59:26,102 --> 00:59:28,983
I told you before.
Southerners are cunning.

590
00:59:29,505 --> 00:59:30,814
Here's Xiao-jun.

591
00:59:31,972 --> 00:59:34,179
The food is a bit late. If you
are hungry, order some noodles.

592
00:59:34,372 --> 00:59:35,978
Have you invited Li Chiao?

593
00:59:36,774 --> 00:59:37,982
Yes.

594
00:59:40,476 --> 00:59:41,615
Enjoy yourself.

595
00:59:46,177 --> 00:59:47,486
What are you doing in the dark?

596
00:59:49,813 --> 00:59:54,889
I am leaving next week. No one will
play basketball with me in New York.

597
00:59:55,216 --> 00:59:58,130
The Americans are so tall. Why
would they want to play with you?

598
00:59:58,283 --> 01:00:01,196
Hey didn't I always kick your ass?

599
01:00:01,819 --> 01:00:03,800
I just let you have it easy.

600
01:00:07,487 --> 01:00:10,094
After I'm gone, take care of yourself.

601
01:00:37,101 --> 01:00:38,045
Congratulations.

602
01:00:39,136 --> 01:00:40,011
Thank you.

603
01:00:42,203 --> 01:00:43,308
I didn't think you would come.

604
01:00:43,438 --> 01:00:44,416
How can I miss your wedding?

605
01:00:46,439 --> 01:00:47,942
You look great.

606
01:00:48,841 --> 01:00:50,844
You've finally achieved your goal.

607
01:00:57,243 --> 01:01:00,054
Pao, let me introduce. The groom.

608
01:01:00,145 --> 01:01:02,148
The groom! Congratulations.

609
01:01:02,246 --> 01:01:05,193
Handsome kid! Where is the bride?

610
01:01:06,047 --> 01:01:07,460
Where is she?

611
01:01:12,951 --> 01:01:14,796
Ready, look at the camera.

612
01:01:14,886 --> 01:01:19,461
Smile, the groom and the bride.
Please look at the camera.

613
01:01:26,891 --> 01:01:28,165
Can't sleep?

614
01:01:28,358 --> 01:01:32,307
Yeah. Maybe I was too stressed out.

615
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:36,874
Maybe you haven't got
used to this new place yet.

616
01:01:37,462 --> 01:01:38,965
Maybe.

617
01:01:43,198 --> 01:01:47,113
There are only two of us
in this house. It's so nice.

618
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:53,751
In a few years, when I've saved
enough money, I'll buy a house for us.

619
01:01:56,303 --> 01:01:57,908
Take your time.

620
01:02:00,906 --> 01:02:03,148
When I first came to Hong Kong,

621
01:02:05,108 --> 01:02:07,019
I always wore that old blue jacket.

622
01:02:08,909 --> 01:02:10,447
Every meal, I ate three bowls of rice.

623
01:02:11,910 --> 01:02:14,859
I fell asleep as soon as I got to the bed.
And I started working as soon as I woke up.

624
01:02:19,414 --> 01:02:21,417
Everyday was a new experience.

625
01:02:30,018 --> 01:02:35,529
If you were next to me, it
would have been so much better.

626
01:03:02,967 --> 01:03:06,576
Cut the crap! Just tell
me who did it first.

627
01:03:08,969 --> 01:03:10,972
You gotta follow the rules kid?

628
01:03:11,070 --> 01:03:13,176
Wait for me, I'll be there! Where?

629
01:03:16,808 --> 01:03:17,980
Something wrong?

630
01:03:18,675 --> 01:03:19,915
Still up?

631
01:03:21,175 --> 01:03:22,883
Your call woke me up.

632
01:03:23,376 --> 01:03:26,221
You were tossing and turning the whole night
anyway. Don't blame it on the phone call.

633
01:03:28,178 --> 01:03:29,180
Where are you going?

634
01:03:31,813 --> 01:03:35,787
Just go to sleep.
Forget the groom, okay?

635
01:03:37,417 --> 01:03:39,124
What are you talking about?

636
01:03:40,818 --> 01:03:44,233
Just one look, I knew you
guys had something going.

637
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:47,867
Kiddo, I've been around.

638
01:03:48,722 --> 01:03:50,134
That was a long time ago.

639
01:03:50,155 --> 01:03:52,636
Cut it out.

640
01:04:02,828 --> 01:04:03,671
What?

641
01:04:05,329 --> 01:04:06,741
When are you coming back?

642
01:04:08,931 --> 01:04:10,275
I will come back if I am alive.

643
01:04:10,564 --> 01:04:12,738
You've gotta come back
even if you are dead.

644
01:04:13,733 --> 01:04:18,183
How can I come back if I'm dead? If I
die, you go and get yourself another guy.

645
01:04:20,737 --> 01:04:21,579
Go back to sleep.

646
01:04:24,337 --> 01:04:25,976
I'm not sleeping tonight.

647
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:30,642
I'll call you for breakfast.

648
01:04:32,041 --> 01:04:33,043
See you.

649
01:04:40,277 --> 01:04:42,053
Have you seen the doctor?

650
01:04:42,779 --> 01:04:46,991
Doctors are useless. They only tell
you to quit drinking and smoking.

651
01:04:47,981 --> 01:04:51,692
If I could quit, I
wouldn't need doctors.

652
01:04:55,618 --> 01:05:00,831
I saw "Love is a Many Splendid Thing" a couple
of nights ago. I've finally seen William Holden.

653
01:05:01,287 --> 01:05:02,197
Really?

654
01:05:02,589 --> 01:05:04,000
I saw that too.

655
01:05:04,922 --> 01:05:08,701
I met him when he was
making that movie in HK.

656
01:05:09,591 --> 01:05:11,629
I even skipped work to visit...

657
01:05:12,025 --> 01:05:15,304
...him on the set.

658
01:05:16,194 --> 01:05:21,805
Later, he took me to the
Peninsular Hotel... For dinner.

659
01:05:23,130 --> 01:05:25,805
That was my first time to the Peninsula.

660
01:05:31,901 --> 01:05:33,142
He was really good looking.

661
01:05:34,102 --> 01:05:35,343
Of course.

662
01:05:36,703 --> 01:05:39,743
When I was young, I was
pretty good looking too.

663
01:05:44,006 --> 01:05:45,748
I'll take you to the doctor.

664
01:05:46,174 --> 01:05:47,084
No.

665
01:05:48,241 --> 01:05:50,950
Just take Lucky for a walk.

666
01:05:51,776 --> 01:05:56,591
Be careful. He has
poor eyesight. He's old.

667
01:06:03,549 --> 01:06:04,755
How are you today?

668
01:06:05,683 --> 01:06:06,560
I'm fine.

669
01:06:06,650 --> 01:06:07,755
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

670
01:06:10,952 --> 01:06:15,596
I am going back to Thailand with
Cabbage soon. She is home sick.

671
01:06:18,990 --> 01:06:20,799
Have you seen Li Chiao?

672
01:06:22,657 --> 01:06:23,500
Yes.

673
01:06:25,259 --> 01:06:26,168
And...

674
01:06:27,759 --> 01:06:29,797
- any...
- No.

675
01:06:30,995 --> 01:06:32,566
She and Xiao-ting became good friends.

676
01:06:32,696 --> 01:06:34,676
Are you kidding?

677
01:06:52,004 --> 01:06:53,507
Li Chiao is really smart.

678
01:06:54,005 --> 01:06:55,007
Yeah.

679
01:06:55,839 --> 01:06:57,114
How long has she been to Hong Kong?

680
01:06:57,506 --> 01:06:58,815
As long as I have.

681
01:06:59,108 --> 01:07:02,852
Her boyfriend must be a smart guy too.

682
01:07:02,942 --> 01:07:04,423
That's her husband.

683
01:07:04,511 --> 01:07:07,459
They told me he's only her boyfriend.

684
01:07:08,745 --> 01:07:10,919
Congratulations, you are a big boss now.

685
01:07:11,013 --> 01:07:14,622
Come on, it's no big deal.
Just a small share holder.

686
01:07:14,715 --> 01:07:15,922
Excuse me.

687
01:07:17,216 --> 01:07:20,027
Hong Kong people love to speak
English. 97 is only around the block.

688
01:07:20,217 --> 01:07:22,925
Help yourself, get
something to eat please.

689
01:07:23,052 --> 01:07:25,055
Thank you. I don't want to gain weight.

690
01:07:25,819 --> 01:07:28,061
But you are so thin!

691
01:07:28,153 --> 01:07:31,033
She hasn't been dancing so
she's afraid of gaining weight.

692
01:07:31,221 --> 01:07:32,531
You're a dancer? What kind?

693
01:07:33,524 --> 01:07:35,526
Everything. From
ballet to Chinese dance.

694
01:07:35,923 --> 01:07:38,929
That's incredible. You can
teach dancing in Hong Kong.

695
01:07:39,625 --> 01:07:41,038
But I don't know anybody.

696
01:07:42,027 --> 01:07:46,773
You should have told me about this.
I'll hook you up. Just leave it to me.

697
01:07:46,962 --> 01:07:48,170
Xiao-ting, Come here.

698
01:07:51,797 --> 01:07:53,369
Come on, hurry up.

699
01:07:53,965 --> 01:07:55,070
Don't be long.

700
01:07:56,399 --> 01:07:57,674
- Have some.
- Alright

701
01:07:59,068 --> 01:08:01,481
I'm starving. Haven't
eaten the whole day.

702
01:08:06,404 --> 01:08:06,972
Where is Pao?

703
01:08:09,173 --> 01:08:10,652
He'll come later, I guess.

704
01:08:10,873 --> 01:08:12,012
Excuse me.

705
01:08:12,574 --> 01:08:13,485
I am sorry.

706
01:08:21,078 --> 01:08:22,523
I've moved.

707
01:08:22,812 --> 01:08:23,814
I was promoted to be the Chef.

708
01:08:24,079 --> 01:08:26,525
Good for you.

709
01:08:27,780 --> 01:08:28,690
Congratulations.

710
01:08:28,781 --> 01:08:29,783
I've moved.

711
01:08:29,881 --> 01:08:31,088
Me too.

712
01:08:32,015 --> 01:08:32,823
I know.

713
01:08:36,486 --> 01:08:37,487
You have just told me.

714
01:08:42,020 --> 01:08:42,794
You're right.

715
01:08:47,722 --> 01:08:49,634
Finally you've become the person
you've always wanted to be.

716
01:08:58,528 --> 01:08:59,564
No one calls you China girl anymore.

717
01:09:01,596 --> 01:09:04,339
When I go to a five star hotel,
people talk to me in English.

718
01:09:04,831 --> 01:09:08,337
When I go shopping, the
sales won't give me the look.

719
01:09:09,967 --> 01:09:15,112
Last month, I went back to my hometown to build a
house. My old neighbours couldn't even recognise me.

720
01:09:16,370 --> 01:09:19,841
I told mom, I'm a honkie at last.

721
01:09:29,575 --> 01:09:34,618
But... mom didn't get to see the house.

722
01:09:35,744 --> 01:09:37,952
She died before it was finished.

723
01:09:45,850 --> 01:09:46,760
Some more.

724
01:09:47,050 --> 01:09:48,086
You take it.

725
01:09:50,051 --> 01:09:51,553
I am so hungry.

726
01:10:20,266 --> 01:10:22,372
This is delicious.

727
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:23,978
You have never eaten in McDonalds?

728
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:28,409
Xiao-jun used to write me
using McDonald's paper mats.

729
01:10:28,569 --> 01:10:31,379
But since I got here, he haled
the mentioning of McDonalds.

730
01:10:33,404 --> 01:10:35,909
With you cooking home dishes,
he doesn't need McDonald.

731
01:10:37,539 --> 01:10:38,780
What are you laughing at?

732
01:10:38,973 --> 01:10:42,081
I heard Cantonese call women "dishes".

733
01:10:42,675 --> 01:10:44,713
Doesn't "home dishes"
mean women at home?

734
01:10:44,843 --> 01:10:46,346
That's you!

735
01:10:47,211 --> 01:10:50,956
You don't even speak Cantonese, but you are
getting all the slang. Did Xiao-jun teach you that?

736
01:10:51,445 --> 01:10:55,021
He doesn't know any. He is so
exhausted from work everyday.

737
01:10:55,348 --> 01:10:58,922
He usually falls fast
asleep. Never even talk to me.

738
01:10:59,649 --> 01:11:02,426
He was real talkative in Wusih.

739
01:11:02,751 --> 01:11:07,931
Every evening, we would
go for ride on our bicycle.

740
01:11:08,921 --> 01:11:13,838
I once asked him where his bicycle
in HK is. He said he got rid of it!

741
01:11:14,824 --> 01:11:17,932
Riding a bike in this traffic is lethal.

742
01:11:18,725 --> 01:11:20,001
That's what he said.

743
01:11:24,494 --> 01:11:25,565
Nice?

744
01:11:27,629 --> 01:11:28,734
Yes.

745
01:11:32,331 --> 01:11:33,676
I think it looks better on you.

746
01:11:33,765 --> 01:11:34,641
Xiao-ting, what are you doing?

747
01:11:34,766 --> 01:11:35,939
A little gift from me.

748
01:11:35,999 --> 01:11:39,846
Come on, I can't accept it.
It's your, you should keep it.

749
01:11:42,736 --> 01:11:43,977
I am sorry.

750
01:11:47,571 --> 01:11:49,279
In fact, I have one exactly the same.

751
01:11:50,473 --> 01:11:52,784
Really?

752
01:11:53,674 --> 01:11:57,886
Yes. It was a gift from an old friend.

753
01:11:58,710 --> 01:12:00,622
This is a gift from Xiao-jun.

754
01:12:01,377 --> 01:12:05,384
I know. That's why you
shouldn't give it away.

755
01:12:06,380 --> 01:12:10,831
But I always wanted to give you
something. You are so nice to me!

756
01:12:11,782 --> 01:12:16,597
Well... Can I take
you to dinner tonight?

757
01:12:17,785 --> 01:12:18,626
OK.

758
01:12:31,524 --> 01:12:35,702
I got the job. I'm having dinner with
Li Chiao tonight, will be late home.

759
01:12:44,264 --> 01:12:46,768
- Go and check the new stock.
- Yes

760
01:12:48,632 --> 01:12:51,239
When is the grand opening?
I'd like to send you flowers.

761
01:12:51,333 --> 01:12:54,942
Order from my florist shop.
Keep the business is the family.

762
01:12:56,936 --> 01:12:57,938
Wait.

763
01:13:00,137 --> 01:13:01,445
Let me take a look.

764
01:13:02,539 --> 01:13:04,179
So pretty.

765
01:13:04,339 --> 01:13:06,445
Did you take any wedding picture?

766
01:13:08,841 --> 01:13:12,484
Let's do it today. It's on the house.

767
01:13:13,977 --> 01:13:15,184
OK?

768
01:13:16,278 --> 01:13:18,259
Happy? come, pick one.

769
01:13:20,247 --> 01:13:21,887
You are pretty!

770
01:13:23,982 --> 01:13:27,556
I can use your picture in the show
window. This is great promotion.

771
01:14:09,402 --> 01:14:10,905
It's just ahead.

772
01:14:11,736 --> 01:14:15,447
I have to do the rehearsal
tonight, I'll come home late.

773
01:14:15,805 --> 01:14:17,547
I can't have dinner with you.

774
01:14:19,407 --> 01:14:20,350
Thank you.

775
01:14:24,309 --> 01:14:25,915
There is noodle in the refrigerator.

776
01:15:09,262 --> 01:15:10,071
There's Teresa Tang!

777
01:15:38,709 --> 01:15:43,786
Thank you!

778
01:15:46,613 --> 01:15:48,456
I got her autograph.

779
01:15:50,815 --> 01:15:52,522
Look at her fans.

780
01:16:02,118 --> 01:16:03,758
It's been awhile since
we feel in love with her.

781
01:16:19,161 --> 01:16:21,540
I gotta run some errands.
Can I let you off here?

782
01:16:33,434 --> 01:16:34,378
See you.

783
01:18:18,749 --> 01:18:20,285
We blew it!

784
01:18:26,452 --> 01:18:27,955
Yes we did.

785
01:18:49,629 --> 01:18:51,632
The room has been decorated.

786
01:18:53,697 --> 01:18:56,008
It's the same ceiling.

787
01:18:56,833 --> 01:18:58,005
And that...

788
01:18:59,301 --> 01:19:03,809
The toilet is new. It's new carpet.

789
01:19:04,637 --> 01:19:05,742
What about the bed?

790
01:19:15,907 --> 01:19:17,354
Remember this?

791
01:19:21,110 --> 01:19:24,651
It was here. This is our old bed.

792
01:19:27,412 --> 01:19:29,859
Nothing here was ours.

793
01:19:33,917 --> 01:19:35,761
Comrade Li Xiao-jun.

794
01:19:37,217 --> 01:19:38,855
What are we going to do?

795
01:19:43,954 --> 01:19:45,435
I want to stop fooling myself.

796
01:19:52,358 --> 01:19:54,032
I will go back and talk to Xiao-ting.

797
01:19:56,060 --> 01:19:57,233
What about me?

798
01:19:59,928 --> 01:20:01,273
You have to make up your mind.

799
01:20:04,764 --> 01:20:06,937
All I want is to wake up
every morning by your side.

800
01:20:44,315 --> 01:20:45,225
Here we are.

801
01:20:46,815 --> 01:20:47,886
Let me walk you to the door.

802
01:20:51,384 --> 01:20:53,627
I think it's better for
me to talk to him alone.

803
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:57,791
What's the matter?

804
01:20:57,988 --> 01:21:00,401
Police, I would like to talk to you.

805
01:21:14,629 --> 01:21:19,010
If Au-yeung Pao contacts you, remember to
tell him that, He is not the one we want.

806
01:21:19,097 --> 01:21:23,844
If he is willing to be our witness, I
guarantee there will be no charges against him.

807
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:27,836
Contact me.

808
01:21:32,604 --> 01:21:33,309
What's the matter?

809
01:21:34,804 --> 01:21:37,946
Pao is in trouble. I
am going up to check.

810
01:21:38,039 --> 01:21:40,919
Chiao. I'll be waiting.

811
01:22:25,060 --> 01:22:28,566
Pao: I'm leaving Hong Kong.
Will call you upon arrival.

812
01:22:30,196 --> 01:22:32,767
Wing, I'd like to see Pao.

813
01:22:32,863 --> 01:22:36,108
Ms Li, boss doesn't
want you to see him now,

814
01:22:36,266 --> 01:22:39,874
I have to talk to him. Where
did you take him for boarding?

815
01:23:01,910 --> 01:23:04,050
Wait for me, I'll be back soon.

816
01:23:09,647 --> 01:23:10,625
Be careful.

817
01:23:51,867 --> 01:23:52,869
Pao.

818
01:24:00,703 --> 01:24:04,483
I told you not to come. Why
did you come? You stupid woman.

819
01:24:07,508 --> 01:24:08,485
You OK?

820
01:24:08,574 --> 01:24:11,681
Just a field trip to
Taiwan, I am used to it.

821
01:24:12,608 --> 01:24:16,888
The cops only wanted
you to be their witness.

822
01:24:16,978 --> 01:24:21,928
That means they are pushing
me to hell! How can I do that?

823
01:24:26,115 --> 01:24:30,088
Pao, I have something to talk to you.

824
01:24:57,729 --> 01:24:58,435
Your Buddhas.

825
01:24:58,529 --> 01:25:00,635
No wonder I felt weird.

826
01:25:03,766 --> 01:25:07,545
We have met, so you can go in peace.

827
01:25:07,768 --> 01:25:09,146
I worry about you.

828
01:25:10,035 --> 01:25:13,075
Come on! You were never that nagging!

829
01:25:15,137 --> 01:25:17,640
Silly girl, listen to me.

830
01:25:18,073 --> 01:25:21,147
Go home now, have a hot bath.

831
01:25:21,740 --> 01:25:26,749
Wake up tomorrow and go get yourself another
guy. There are tons better than me out there.

832
01:25:31,144 --> 01:25:32,590
Don't worry, I can manage,

833
01:25:33,145 --> 01:25:37,061
I have many wives in Taiwan.

834
01:25:37,848 --> 01:25:40,990
One in Kao Hsung. One in Tai Chung.

835
01:25:42,050 --> 01:25:44,997
One in Hua Lian. Even one in Ali Shan.

836
01:27:03,954 --> 01:27:07,961
When did it all start?

837
01:27:09,956 --> 01:27:11,459
Maybe long long time ago.

838
01:27:14,491 --> 01:27:15,562
Does she love you?

839
01:27:17,059 --> 01:27:18,402
I don't know.

840
01:27:20,894 --> 01:27:23,465
Then, why did you marry me?

841
01:27:26,596 --> 01:27:27,975
That's my goal and dream.

842
01:27:28,965 --> 01:27:30,876
Come on. Come with me.

843
01:27:33,467 --> 01:27:37,076
Pack up now. Let's go
back to Wusih right now.

844
01:27:38,369 --> 01:27:42,512
Come on, pack up now.
Don't come back forever.

845
01:27:45,505 --> 01:27:50,959
If you didn't come to Hong Kong. This
wouldn't have... This wouldn't have happened.

846
01:27:51,908 --> 01:27:52,818
Right?

847
01:28:03,447 --> 01:28:04,518
But...

848
01:28:08,648 --> 01:28:10,458
You came.

849
01:28:14,818 --> 01:28:16,423
And she came.

850
01:28:18,820 --> 01:28:23,237
At last, I came too.

851
01:28:29,859 --> 01:28:30,837
Xiao-ting.

852
01:28:35,828 --> 01:28:37,331
We can't go back anymore.

853
01:29:03,375 --> 01:29:04,411
Xiao-jun,

854
01:29:04,974 --> 01:29:09,321
You are my only relative in Hong Kong.

855
01:29:10,376 --> 01:29:11,789
If I die,

856
01:29:12,179 --> 01:29:16,595
This house and everything
in it will go to you.

857
01:29:17,580 --> 01:29:22,395
The most valuable things in my
life... Are all kept in this trunk.

858
01:29:28,719 --> 01:29:34,229
I remember that was the happiest day in my
life... William took me to dinner at the Peninsula.

859
01:29:35,989 --> 01:29:41,703
When he wasn't paying attention,
I stole the knife and fork we used.

860
01:29:42,692 --> 01:29:47,609
I felt contented...
Every time I look at it.

861
01:29:50,228 --> 01:29:52,710
Maybe William had forgotten me.

862
01:29:53,696 --> 01:29:57,236
Never mind, he is always
in my mind, that's enough.

863
01:29:58,432 --> 01:30:00,936
By the way, I am so old and ugly now.

864
01:30:01,834 --> 01:30:04,509
It's good for him not
to see me like this.

865
01:30:53,558 --> 01:30:54,468
Xiao-ting.

866
01:30:56,359 --> 01:30:59,899
I am going to work now.
Just stay away from me.

867
01:31:01,062 --> 01:31:06,013
I am trying to live
alone. So, don't come over.

868
01:31:06,196 --> 01:31:08,404
I'll get over it.

869
01:31:08,965 --> 01:31:10,376
Xiao-ting...

870
01:31:28,306 --> 01:31:30,514
I thought I couldn't see you again.

871
01:31:30,674 --> 01:31:32,313
I will come and visit you.

872
01:31:33,976 --> 01:31:35,320
Better make it quick.

873
01:31:37,078 --> 01:31:38,387
Cabbage got AIDS.

874
01:31:50,216 --> 01:31:51,525
Taxi.

875
01:31:54,551 --> 01:31:55,427
Take care.

876
01:31:56,619 --> 01:31:58,065
You too, take care.

877
01:31:59,154 --> 01:31:59,929
- Goodbye.
- Bye bye.

878
01:32:16,628 --> 01:32:20,133
Xiao-ting, I don't
have anything for you.

879
01:32:20,863 --> 01:32:23,470
These money belongs to Rosie.

880
01:32:24,431 --> 01:32:27,437
All I want is for you to live happily.

881
01:32:29,134 --> 01:32:30,637
I'm leaving tomorrow.

882
01:32:31,635 --> 01:32:34,948
I'm scared. It's the 1st time I fly.

883
01:32:36,337 --> 01:32:38,375
I've never been too gutsy.

884
01:32:40,138 --> 01:32:41,585
I dare not ask you to forgive me.

885
01:32:43,273 --> 01:32:46,883
I just hope that, we have
been together all these years

886
01:32:47,576 --> 01:32:50,182
We have walked all these paths...

887
01:32:51,411 --> 01:32:54,883
Xiao-ting, it broke my heart too.

888
01:33:41,100 --> 01:33:45,243
I'm going to the English class tonight.
Remember to pick up the kids from school.

889
01:33:45,336 --> 01:33:46,748
No problem.

890
01:33:47,236 --> 01:33:49,148
Free English tutor, you wanna go?

891
01:33:49,471 --> 01:33:51,348
I took enough lesson
the last time around.

892
01:33:51,438 --> 01:33:53,146
You can learn it again.

893
01:33:53,539 --> 01:33:55,349
Something in life, you
only need to learn once.

894
01:33:56,540 --> 01:33:59,351
What is in your mind?
Just forget the past.

895
01:33:59,442 --> 01:34:04,952
Fate is... predestined... and
fate is... ...Also match-making?

896
01:34:05,077 --> 01:34:06,956
You're full of crap!

897
01:34:07,078 --> 01:34:12,896
Match-making! You always cook for others,
don't you want someone to cook for you?

898
01:34:13,949 --> 01:34:15,189
That girl is really nice.

899
01:34:15,349 --> 01:34:16,351
Turn off the fire for
me please, thank you.

900
01:34:19,051 --> 01:34:20,497
Chicken for to go.

901
01:34:22,552 --> 01:34:23,861
Your chicken to go, sir.

902
01:34:47,797 --> 01:34:53,044
It's funny. This place looks
like Yaumatai 30 years ago.

903
01:34:53,932 --> 01:34:59,009
Narrow streets crowded with people. This shops
are small, but you can buy everything there.

904
01:35:00,002 --> 01:35:02,916
All kinds of restaurants.

905
01:35:05,205 --> 01:35:07,208
When I was eleven or twelve, I
started to make a living in Yaumatai...

906
01:35:08,306 --> 01:35:12,949
Who would have known... I'd return to
the same kind of dump decades later.

907
01:35:13,308 --> 01:35:15,016
This chicken is so good.

908
01:35:15,943 --> 01:35:17,355
In fact, do you like it there?

909
01:35:18,811 --> 01:35:20,415
It's the same everywhere.

910
01:35:23,113 --> 01:35:25,856
Two years, six towns.
I can't run anymore.

911
01:35:27,415 --> 01:35:28,827
Why not unpack the boxes?

912
01:35:31,217 --> 01:35:35,531
Better buy some furniture.
Better fix an altar for workshop.

913
01:35:38,319 --> 01:35:39,958
Better have a baby.

914
01:35:44,289 --> 01:35:49,401
Baby is a lot of trouble. It
keeps on crying and crawling.

915
01:35:51,058 --> 01:35:55,703
Better not unpack the boxes yet.
Let's go find a bigger place.

916
01:36:19,271 --> 01:36:21,218
OK, come on.

917
01:36:24,074 --> 01:36:25,486
Get the ball.

918
01:36:26,508 --> 01:36:28,785
Alright, you naughty
kids, come and eat now.

919
01:36:28,875 --> 01:36:30,788
OK, go... wash your hands.

920
01:36:33,178 --> 01:36:34,681
Can't you go take care of her?

921
01:36:35,112 --> 01:36:37,024
I am taking care of her.
I am cooking for her.

922
01:36:37,113 --> 01:36:39,493
Better talk to her.

923
01:36:40,114 --> 01:36:41,789
I don't even know her.
I have nothing to say.

924
01:36:47,718 --> 01:36:51,929
I spent $30 to set you up with a nice
lady. And you're doing this to me?

925
01:36:55,921 --> 01:36:58,061
Yes. I'm doing this to you.

926
01:36:58,155 --> 01:36:58,963
Damn it!

927
01:36:59,223 --> 01:37:00,931
Sausage.

928
01:37:05,026 --> 01:37:07,337
Although it's old, it has a big garden.

929
01:37:07,360 --> 01:37:11,333
$300,000 for that dump, it's a rip off.
Besides, we haven't got that kind of money.

930
01:37:11,362 --> 01:37:12,433
Easy, we'll sell you to the brothel.

931
01:37:12,729 --> 01:37:14,676
Go ahead it you think you won't regret.

932
01:37:14,930 --> 01:37:17,674
I think we should buy an
apartment and rent it out.

933
01:37:17,732 --> 01:37:21,943
I always dream of owing
a house with a garden,

934
01:37:22,233 --> 01:37:24,077
Kids running all over the place.

935
01:37:24,935 --> 01:37:26,142
I've gotta get the laundry.

936
01:37:26,335 --> 01:37:27,245
Go ahead.

937
01:37:27,436 --> 01:37:28,643
Wait for me.

938
01:37:50,612 --> 01:37:51,784
Give me a cigarette.

939
01:37:51,980 --> 01:37:54,086
I just want smoke, don't brother me, OK?

940
01:37:54,781 --> 01:37:55,624
Give me your cigarette,

941
01:37:55,981 --> 01:37:58,190
You kid!

942
01:37:59,718 --> 01:38:00,822
Take it...

943
01:38:03,919 --> 01:38:04,795
Look. What a nice watch.

944
01:38:04,886 --> 01:38:07,299
Grab it. Good old-man,
give me your fucking watch,

945
01:40:31,420 --> 01:40:32,899
Do you recognize him or not?

946
01:40:35,687 --> 01:40:37,532
Please turn him over.

947
01:41:44,686 --> 01:41:47,794
Miss Li Chiao, your visa has expired.

948
01:41:47,887 --> 01:41:49,834
Under United States immigration law.

949
01:41:49,988 --> 01:41:54,302
You must be departed within 48 hours.
Then you will be escorted to the airport.

950
01:41:56,791 --> 01:41:59,534
Move it, come on move it.

951
01:42:04,695 --> 01:42:06,801
This drop off is driving me crazy.

952
01:42:06,896 --> 01:42:10,436
Tell me about it. This
is my third run today.

953
01:42:10,798 --> 01:42:14,508
I already had two
Mexicans and Indian family.

954
01:42:14,632 --> 01:42:17,012
Maybe we could tell her take
the airport coach, instead.

955
01:42:23,404 --> 01:42:27,353
Well, at least she deserves
one chance to try to get away.

956
01:42:57,552 --> 01:42:59,760
Go, go, go.

957
01:43:40,972 --> 01:43:41,711
Li Xiao-jun.

958
01:43:54,645 --> 01:43:56,420
Li Xiao-jun...

959
01:45:44,959 --> 01:45:47,839
I've got the green card.

960
01:45:49,128 --> 01:45:53,669
No problem... I paid a lawyer
for this, it'll be alright.

961
01:45:54,262 --> 01:45:58,144
I booked tickets home. Yes,
I am coming back at last.

962
01:45:58,731 --> 01:46:02,270
Let's talk later, don't waste
money. Dad, you get some rest.

963
01:46:02,667 --> 01:46:05,171
Yes, I know! Bye bye.

964
01:46:08,837 --> 01:46:11,249
We are approaching
the Statue of Liberty.

965
01:46:15,738 --> 01:46:18,276
Where is China Town?

966
01:46:18,541 --> 01:46:19,953
Over there, can you see that?

967
01:46:20,642 --> 01:46:24,592
Soho, this side is the
Soho, that is Little Italy.

968
01:46:24,743 --> 01:46:26,690
Then, China Town.

969
01:46:26,778 --> 01:46:27,951
Can you see our restaurant?

970
01:46:28,478 --> 01:46:30,755
Yes, the one with a red roof.

971
01:46:30,846 --> 01:46:31,951
The green roof.

972
01:46:32,279 --> 01:46:32,951
Red.

973
01:46:33,246 --> 01:46:35,284
Can you see the triangular
roof? Just next to it.

974
01:46:35,381 --> 01:46:39,490
The one next to the building with a triangular
roof. I've been to the roof, it's red.

975
01:46:39,583 --> 01:46:41,359
I am so sure of it.

976
01:46:42,852 --> 01:46:47,735
Come on, stop arguing. In a few years, I'll
open a Chinese Restaurant on the Empire State.

977
01:46:47,820 --> 01:46:52,100
We'll name it "Top of the World". So we
can see it from anywhere is Manhattan?

978
01:46:56,391 --> 01:46:59,135
Top of the World.

979
01:47:04,795 --> 01:47:07,298
Ready, look at the camera.
Everyone cheese! OK!

980
01:47:10,330 --> 01:47:13,802
Ms Li, how long will we stay
at the Statue of Liberty?

981
01:47:14,132 --> 01:47:16,703
I have to buy some Gucci handbags.

982
01:47:16,833 --> 01:47:20,715
No hurry, just take some pictures
first. I'll take you to shop later, OK?

983
01:47:21,302 --> 01:47:23,146
I heard people said that
you came from Guangzhou.

984
01:47:23,303 --> 01:47:25,511
Yes, I left China ten years ago.

985
01:47:25,604 --> 01:47:26,845
How long haven't you been back?

986
01:47:29,139 --> 01:47:30,209
I'll go back next month.

987
01:47:30,306 --> 01:47:34,154
Right... people always wanted to leave
back in the 80's. Now, they all go back.

988
01:47:34,408 --> 01:47:36,616
Many Hong Kong people
working the Mainland now.

989
01:47:36,709 --> 01:47:40,659
Yeah, most people regret they ever left. There
are plenty of golden opportunities in China.

990
01:47:40,811 --> 01:47:41,813
Yeah!

991
01:48:09,491 --> 01:48:11,665
Now, it's high season.

992
01:48:11,792 --> 01:48:15,263
Reservation is tough. You
didn't confirm, so it's gone.

993
01:48:15,392 --> 01:48:17,373
OK, call me tomorrow morning.

994
01:48:18,361 --> 01:48:20,103
What a trouble.

995
01:48:20,562 --> 01:48:22,201
Your ticket is issued.

996
01:48:23,197 --> 01:48:26,373
You have got your green card
too. You can go home now.

997
01:48:27,164 --> 01:48:29,669
Is Mr. Chan's ticket
ready? He called many times.

998
01:48:29,766 --> 01:48:31,302
Enjoy yourself.

999
01:48:32,267 --> 01:48:35,273
Miss Teresa Tang, the famous
Chinese pop song queen,

1000
01:48:35,368 --> 01:48:37,610
died of asthma today at her
hotel room in Pattaya, Thailand.

1001
01:48:37,703 --> 01:48:41,881
She died young at age 42.

1002
01:48:42,672 --> 01:48:46,622
Teresa was a native of Shantung,

1003
01:48:46,741 --> 01:48:48,619
she was born in 1953
to a soldier's family.

1004
01:48:49,008 --> 01:48:53,823
Teresa started in show business at 11. Soon, she
became the most popular pop song singer in Taiwan.

1005
01:48:54,109 --> 01:48:58,617
She always traveled Taiwan,
HK and SE Asia for performances.

1006
01:48:59,113 --> 01:49:01,822
Her sweet and feminine voice
fascinated all her fans,

1007
01:49:02,615 --> 01:49:08,660
She was crowned the
Queen of Lyric songs.

1008
01:49:30,059 --> 01:49:34,477
The prime of her career was
from the middle 70's to the 80's.

1009
01:49:34,829 --> 01:49:38,437
In mid 70's her songs started
to storm Mainland China.

1010
01:49:38,530 --> 01:49:41,570
Soon, she became a phenomenon in China.

1011
01:49:41,732 --> 01:49:44,145
Big cities or small villages,

1012
01:49:44,234 --> 01:49:47,182
people could hear her
songs anytime, anywhere.

1013
01:49:47,368 --> 01:49:49,849
Her songs win the hearts of
numerous Chinese all over the world.

1014
01:49:50,134 --> 01:49:54,141
People said, if only there are
Chinese, you can hear Teresa's songs.
