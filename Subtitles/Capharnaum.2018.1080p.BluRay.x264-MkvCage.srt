1
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:04,438
Raise the head.

2
00:01:10,486 --> 00:01:12,613
He no longer has any milk teeth.

3
00:01:13,447 --> 00:01:17,743
I would say he is 12, or 13.

4
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:20,538
Michelle, the Filipina?

5
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:21,831
Michelle?

6
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:24,500
What is your surname?

7
00:01:25,042 --> 00:01:27,878
Surname?

8
00:01:28,629 --> 00:01:30,756
- Sedad.
- Sedad.

9
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,676
You have a passport?
A residence permit?

10
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:35,803
At home, at my boss's house.

11
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:39,223
Lama Bekoum.

12
00:01:40,641 --> 00:01:41,809
Who is Lama?

13
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:43,936
Lama, are you pregnant?

14
00:01:44,061 --> 00:01:44,645
Yes.

15
00:01:44,812 --> 00:01:46,063
How pregnant are you?

16
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,523
Seven months.

17
00:01:48,816 --> 00:01:51,235
OK, Caritas is going to see you.

18
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:54,030
Who is Tigest Ai lo?

19
00:01:54,196 --> 00:01:56,032
The Ethiopian, Tigest Ailo?

20
00:01:57,074 --> 00:01:58,451
Is it you Tigest?

21
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,337
The hearing is open.

22
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,132
Zain Al Hajj.

23
00:05:42,299 --> 00:05:44,802
Remove the handcuffs.
Come closer.

24
00:05:46,053 --> 00:05:47,388
Souad and Selim Al Hajj.

25
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:48,556
Yes.

26
00:05:51,433 --> 00:05:53,102
The complainant is in detention.

27
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:55,229
He is present and without handcuffs.

28
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:56,396
Show me your hands.

29
00:05:59,191 --> 00:06:00,901
Also presents

30
00:06:01,485 --> 00:06:04,029
His lawyer Nadine Al Aalam.

31
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:06,365
Accused are also present

32
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:08,742
Selim and Souad Al Hajj,

33
00:06:08,909 --> 00:06:12,246
represented by their lawyer Said Tamer.

34
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:17,251
Do you know why
Are you here, Souad?

35
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:20,629
Yes, I know why, your Honor.

36
00:06:20,796 --> 00:06:22,047
Why?

37
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,634
I know my son
to serve his sentence in prison,

38
00:06:25,801 --> 00:06:27,928
but why does he drag us here
Again, I do not know.

39
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:30,180
We just are "mops”,
anyone can attack us!

40
00:06:30,347 --> 00:06:33,267
You were called as a witness
at Zain's previous trial, is that?

41
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:34,268
Yes.

42
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:35,561
And you had testified?

43
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:36,729
Yes.

44
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,898
And now you are accused.

45
00:06:39,648 --> 00:06:41,567
Do you know why
Zain was charged?

46
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:46,864
Zain got into a dirty story
Because of his childishness.

47
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:51,076
Childish? He was sentenced
5 years in prison!

48
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,786
Childish?

49
00:06:53,787 --> 00:06:54,787
Short...

50
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:57,082
How old are you Zain?

51
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:59,627
I do not know,
ask them the question.

52
00:06:59,793 --> 00:07:02,588
Your Honor, Zain was not
declared at birth,

53
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:07,509
and he has never been registered
the civil status.

54
00:07:07,676 --> 00:07:11,180
And since obviously his parents
do not know

55
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:13,849
his exact date of birth

56
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,727
Here is the report of the medical examiner

57
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:20,230
which certifies that
Zain was about 12 years old

58
00:07:20,397 --> 00:07:22,524
at the time of the incident.

59
00:07:22,691 --> 00:07:24,944
So he is almost 12 years old?

60
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,362
Absolutely.

61
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,614
Where do you live Zain?

62
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,741
Roumieh prison for minors.

63
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:34,495
You were arrested on June 15 and you
have been serving your sentence since.

64
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:36,038
Do you know why?

65
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:39,917
Because I planted
a son of a bitch with a knife.

66
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:42,127
Did you stab someone?

67
00:07:42,294 --> 00:07:43,534
Yes, and it's a son of a bitch.

68
00:07:43,587 --> 00:07:44,587
Oh?

69
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:46,215
You insist?

70
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:49,218
Forbidden to laugh in the room!

71
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:51,720
What's all this pandemonium
What did you provoke?

72
00:07:51,887 --> 00:07:55,099
On the TV and in the media.
Your prison call.

73
00:07:55,265 --> 00:07:56,684
Do you know why you're here?

74
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:57,850
Yes.

75
00:07:58,394 --> 00:07:59,394
Why?

76
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,106
I want to complain
against my parents.

77
00:08:03,273 --> 00:08:05,567
Why do you want to complain
against your parents?

78
00:08:07,569 --> 00:08:09,697
For giving me birth.

79
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,082
Hello.

80
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:22,376
I would like two boxes of Tramadol.

81
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:24,253
You need a prescription.

82
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,344
Who is it for?

83
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,262
My mother.

84
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:34,805
Why she did not come herself?

85
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:36,890
She had surgery on her belly.

86
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:44,648
She broke her back.

87
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,567
This is his doctor
who prescribed him?

88
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:47,359
Yes.

89
00:08:47,526 --> 00:08:49,570
Why it's not your father
who came?

90
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:50,946
He is paralyzed.

91
00:10:06,438 --> 00:10:08,649
- You come to see who, Madam?
- My son.

92
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:10,818
- His name?
- Ibrahim Al Hajj.

93
00:10:10,984 --> 00:10:12,903
- Ibrahim Al Hajj?
- Yes.

94
00:10:16,406 --> 00:10:18,450
Aunt Souad?
This way!

95
00:10:20,035 --> 00:10:23,205
Massoud? It's you?
How are you?

96
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,624
How are you, my dear?

97
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,794
My son Ibrahim is with you?

98
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:31,171
No, they took him away
in another cell.

99
00:10:31,338 --> 00:10:33,423
She's trying to talk to you!

100
00:10:34,299 --> 00:10:35,801
Tell him "bye".

101
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,928
Say bye to your cousin.

102
00:10:39,054 --> 00:10:41,265
Your brothers are all with you
in cell?

103
00:10:41,431 --> 00:10:42,266
Yes, everyone.

104
00:10:42,432 --> 00:10:43,976
May God protect you.

105
00:10:57,197 --> 00:11:00,742
We increased the price S 15 a mouthful.

106
00:11:00,909 --> 00:11:04,329
Our hands are busted
force to soak and wring.

107
00:11:04,496 --> 00:11:09,251
Our "sock juice" is worth more
only a kilo of meat!

108
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:11,336
Be proud of you!

109
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:37,571
Get away!

110
00:11:51,668 --> 00:11:55,172
- We have an exam tomorrow?
- Look at your calendar.

111
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:07,935
That's for your mother.

112
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:11,188
And that's for my pretty Sahar.

113
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:12,773
I miss her.

114
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:15,025
Licorice and ramen.

115
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:16,777
Thank you.

116
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:18,195
Later.

117
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,318
What a bastard, Assaad's father.

118
00:12:58,485 --> 00:13:00,904
Whenever it fills
the water reservoir,

119
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:04,366
we drown because of
his crappy piping!

120
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:09,079
This asshole thinks that
it's a gift? This rat hole?

121
00:13:11,748 --> 00:13:12,374
Sahar!

122
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,127
It's not a house!

123
00:13:15,752 --> 00:13:17,754
It's a pigsty!

124
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:21,633
Get out! You are going to be
Electrocute, mess!

125
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:25,178
- House of misfortune!
- Go live in the street.

126
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:27,597
There is plenty of room!

127
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:35,063
Zain, why the vegetables
are rotten? Did you upset Assaad?

128
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:41,111
Zain, he gave you the liquorice
and the ramen?

129
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:37,459
It's not even day, fucking!
Give me a break!

130
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:39,294
Stand up, idiot!

131
00:15:05,987 --> 00:15:08,740
This juice is best,
forget the rest!

132
00:15:37,352 --> 00:15:38,854
Sahar, come here.

133
00:15:41,022 --> 00:15:43,275
Why is there blood on your pants?

134
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,985
Where's the blood?

135
00:15:55,203 --> 00:15:57,831
Hurry before we are seen.

136
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,878
Do you remember what happened?
Your girlfriend Alia?

137
00:16:03,044 --> 00:16:05,505
When his mother found out,
she locked her up at home

138
00:16:05,672 --> 00:16:08,967
until the day when a big pig
came to take her.

139
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:11,803
Mom won't want you.
She'll toss you in the street.

140
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:15,098
- She'll give you to Assaad.
- But Assaad is really nice.

141
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:16,349
He is a motherfucker!

142
00:16:16,516 --> 00:16:19,478
He offers me ramen and liquorice.

143
00:16:19,644 --> 00:16:21,396
He'll give you shit to eat!

144
00:16:22,105 --> 00:16:24,816
They will give you to Assaad,
they will get rid of you.

145
00:16:24,983 --> 00:16:26,860
We will never see you again.

146
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:31,531
And he will throw you with the rats,
he will shut you up, cover the windows

147
00:16:31,698 --> 00:16:33,617
Will not let you out.

148
00:16:33,783 --> 00:16:37,829
He will give you a drop of water
every 3 days and old ramen.

149
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:43,710
You did not see his ear?
A sewer rat bit him.

150
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:50,258
Here, put this on.

151
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:01,686
You've finished?

152
00:17:01,811 --> 00:17:02,938
Yes.

153
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,606
Here.

154
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:06,107
What do I do?

155
00:17:06,566 --> 00:17:09,653
Put it like that,
down in your pants.

156
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:33,468
Your hair is so lovely!
Who styled it?

157
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:34,803
Show me.

158
00:17:37,305 --> 00:17:39,099
So, chief, are you finished?

159
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:42,727
I still have the cans to put away,
but my mother needs Sahar.

160
00:17:42,894 --> 00:17:44,980
Stay again.
I'm happy to have your sister here.

161
00:17:45,146 --> 00:17:46,523
I'll bring her back later.

162
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,733
I'll talk to your mother.

163
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:52,070
Bye.

164
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:52,881
Careful, don't leave
those rags just anywhere.

165
00:18:53,256 --> 00:18:55,967
I'll tell you where to hide them.

166
00:18:58,845 --> 00:19:01,056
- You got pig?
- Yes.

167
00:19:01,222 --> 00:19:03,475
You do not throw them
in the trash.

168
00:19:14,152 --> 00:19:17,030
Juice of beet, flavor so sweet!

169
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:20,992
Tomato so red, use your head!

170
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,496
It's 250.

171
00:19:24,996 --> 00:19:26,915
Thanks bye.

172
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:28,917
Hold.

173
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:31,544
May God bless you.

174
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:38,635
Take two.

175
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:48,645
What do you want?

176
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:51,272
- Just show you something.
- Leave me alone.

177
00:19:53,733 --> 00:19:55,276
Come on, just a moment!

178
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:57,904
Fuck you, bastard.

179
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,573
Leave him, Zain.

180
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:02,575
Don't piss me off!

181
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:09,791
Why sign up for school?

182
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:14,879
Out of the question. Forget it,
and keep working for Assaad.

183
00:20:15,338 --> 00:20:18,425
Why are you complicating things?

184
00:20:18,883 --> 00:20:21,720
It's not better that he goes to learn
two or three words?

185
00:20:21,886 --> 00:20:24,723
Go to your heart,
but do not wake her up.

186
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:26,725
Let him go to school.

187
00:20:26,891 --> 00:20:32,272
They will send us something to eat
and get dressed, for kids

188
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:35,316
And what does Assaad say?

189
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,861
I'll talk to him.

190
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,739
In the morning, I will go to school,

191
00:20:40,905 --> 00:20:43,616
and in the afternoon
I will work at home.

192
00:20:43,783 --> 00:20:46,703
Look at Farid,
the neighbor's son, Zahra.

193
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,998
He returns from school
with all kinds of stuff.

194
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:52,834
They will give us mattresses,
clothes

195
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:53,626
Shut up!

196
00:20:53,793 --> 00:20:57,881
At least he'll eat there and
bring food to his sisters.

197
00:20:58,047 --> 00:21:01,718
They receive the remains of the hotels
and the most beautiful marriages.

198
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:05,764
Enjoy it a bit!
Why are you so stubborn?

199
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:07,807
Inch'Allah we will see Monday.

200
00:21:07,974 --> 00:21:08,974
Inch Allah?

201
00:21:09,058 --> 00:21:10,810
Do you want me to swear on bread?

202
00:21:10,977 --> 00:21:12,437
I said yes.

203
00:21:12,937 --> 00:21:15,857
And if Assaad gets vexed
and puts us out?

204
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:18,193
Do not worry,
he will not get angry.

205
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:21,696
We will send him Zain after school
and he will do overtime.

206
00:21:40,256 --> 00:21:42,258
Soap of my balls!

207
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,937
Why are you pouting?

208
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:56,314
Take it easy.

209
00:21:57,482 --> 00:22:01,611
Bring a gas canister
to Em Habib down the street

210
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:40,066
Ms. Bahia, I'm done.

211
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,235
- How much is it?
- 13,000.

212
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:08,011
Do not touch me, fucked!

213
00:23:25,486 --> 00:23:27,697
Where do these chickens come from?

214
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:29,741
Who brought them?

215
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:31,326
It's Assaad, he's at home.

216
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:34,453
Assaad is up there?

217
00:23:34,495 --> 00:23:35,495
Yes.

218
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:56,850
Mum?

219
00:23:57,518 --> 00:23:59,854
What are Assaad and
his father doing here?

220
00:24:00,563 --> 00:24:03,191
- Do not make a scene.
- Yeah, you'll see.

221
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:04,793
- What are they doing here?
- Calm down.

222
00:24:04,817 --> 00:24:06,819
They discuss our rent
with your father.

223
00:24:06,986 --> 00:24:08,696
I'd cut off my left hand

224
00:24:08,863 --> 00:24:10,782
they give you the hens
in exchange for Sahar.

225
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,325
Wait, listen to me

226
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:15,372
You're going to say this son of a bitch
that he did not do anything here.

227
00:24:15,536 --> 00:24:18,122
- You do not understand?
- Go tell him or I do it.

228
00:24:18,289 --> 00:24:19,290
Lower your voice.

229
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:22,335
I swear by your sisters,
I swear by God.

230
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:24,837
That there is nothing at all here.

231
00:24:25,004 --> 00:24:29,968
- So why is Sahar made up?
- She imitates me to have fun.

232
00:24:30,134 --> 00:24:32,294
As soon as they finish the juice,
I'm kicking them out.

233
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:35,014
Listen, don't.

234
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:37,183
Go tell him that's not going to work.

235
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,227
Go tell him or I will.

236
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:41,479
I do not want to hear it.

237
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:43,606
Do you want him to throw us out?

238
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:44,983
Not a word.

239
00:24:45,608 --> 00:24:47,652
Welcome, dear neighbors!

240
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:52,865
Abu Assaad, please help yourself.

241
00:24:53,282 --> 00:24:54,492
Thank you.

242
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,244
Have some, Assaad.

243
00:24:57,245 --> 00:25:00,206
Dearie, take your sister
into the other room.

244
00:25:09,465 --> 00:25:12,719
Wipe off that ugly lipstick.

245
00:25:13,302 --> 00:25:15,972
You look like a witch
in this dress.

246
00:27:43,369 --> 00:27:44,453
Sahar.”

247
00:27:44,787 --> 00:27:45,955
Sahar!

248
00:27:46,455 --> 00:27:49,083
Wakes up,
I'll take you somewhere.

249
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:52,253
- Where's that?
- 1 will tell you later. Arise.

250
00:27:53,504 --> 00:27:55,756
Be ready when I come back.

251
00:27:55,923 --> 00:27:57,133
Do not say anything to anyone.

252
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:46,057
How much until Cola?

253
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,558
1,000.

254
00:28:49,685 --> 00:28:54,232
And if I put my sister on my lap,
1,000 pounds will do the trick?

255
00:28:54,398 --> 00:28:56,150
Where is your sister?

256
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:57,818
At home, I'll get her.

257
00:28:57,985 --> 00:29:01,113
No problem, go get her.

258
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:17,046
I do not want to leave, pity

259
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,632
I do not want to leave,
I beg you.

260
00:29:21,008 --> 00:29:22,635
Mom, I do not want to leave!

261
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:25,513
I kill you if you dare
put your feet back here.

262
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:28,557
Where are you taking her,
you bunch of cretins?

263
00:29:28,724 --> 00:29:31,477
To be a maid for
that son of a bitch?

264
00:29:32,561 --> 00:29:33,813
I want to stay with my brother.

265
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,314
It's none of your business.

266
00:29:35,481 --> 00:29:38,442
- Mom, she's just a child.
- Mind your own business.

267
00:29:38,609 --> 00:29:40,236
Step away I said!

268
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:41,779
Do not be fooled by this.

269
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,030
You, go downstairs.

270
00:29:43,197 --> 00:29:45,908
Zain, if you still try
something, I kill you.

271
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:47,910
I understood your little game, bastard.

272
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:50,746
You were going to fuck us
in shit, little junk.

273
00:29:50,913 --> 00:29:54,667
You send it wipe
the shit of this pig!

274
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:56,544
Kiss my ass, and you go down.

275
00:29:57,628 --> 00:29:58,628
You, go down.

276
00:29:59,213 --> 00:30:00,256
Let her go!

277
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:02,383
She will not go to Assaad!

278
00:30:02,883 --> 00:30:04,677
Little bastard!

279
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:06,137
Open the door, little asshole.

280
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:08,139
I do not want to leave, Mom!

281
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,724
I do not want!

282
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:11,434
Let me go!

283
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,729
I beg you, Mom,
ll do not want to leave.

284
00:30:14,895 --> 00:30:16,272
Come on, Sahar!

285
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:18,398
It's enough!

286
00:30:20,234 --> 00:30:22,695
You stay here, 1 tell you!

287
00:30:26,532 --> 00:30:28,159
I want to stay here.
I beg you.

288
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:29,577
Come down.

289
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:31,787
Come down! Come down!

290
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:36,292
Mom, pity, I beg you!

291
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:37,459
Son of a bitch.

292
00:30:38,544 --> 00:30:41,047
It's enough!
I can not stand this hell anymore.

293
00:30:41,213 --> 00:30:43,299
I do not want to leave, Mom!

294
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:46,344
Stop!
Y tired of your bullshit!

295
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,057
Get her up, shit!

296
00:30:51,223 --> 00:30:54,518
Another word
and I cut your tongue off!

297
00:31:03,861 --> 00:31:04,904
No!

298
00:31:13,829 --> 00:31:15,081
Sahar!

299
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,500
Sahar!

300
00:31:19,001 --> 00:31:20,669
Let her go!

301
00:31:28,594 --> 00:31:30,096
You are happy?

302
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:36,185
You're playing the big man?

303
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:40,606
You're going to pay him dear, rascal!

304
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:46,904
Let her go!

305
00:32:17,476 --> 00:32:20,521
It was to lift her out of misery.

306
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:22,523
With me, she was doomed.

307
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:25,693
She barely has a bed to sleep,

308
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,779
Barely enough to eat and drink.
She does not wash herself.

309
00:32:28,946 --> 00:32:30,698
Never watches TV.

310
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:34,827
I told myself, "Marry her,
at least she'll sleep in a bed."”

311
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:36,287
A real bed.

312
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,582
With a blanket.

313
00:32:40,499 --> 00:32:41,601
She can eat as much as she likes.

314
00:32:41,625 --> 00:32:44,837
- You didn't know it would come to this?
- Never!

315
00:32:45,629 --> 00:32:48,007
I never wanted that!

316
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:55,973
You think I'm proud
that my son stabbed someone?

317
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,934
Have you considered the possibility
that it is not our fault?

318
00:32:59,101 --> 00:33:02,188
I was born this way, raised this way,
how have I done wrong?

319
00:33:02,354 --> 00:33:06,275
If I had the choice, I would be
maybe better than all of you!

320
00:33:06,692 --> 00:33:09,570
- You can not say that.
- Please

321
00:33:10,237 --> 00:33:13,073
Now, people are spitting on me
in the street.

322
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:16,076
They treat me like an animal.

323
00:33:18,245 --> 00:33:21,040
I never asked for any of this.

324
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:24,251
1 was told, "If you do not have children,
You are not a man.”

325
00:33:24,418 --> 00:33:27,171
"Your children will be
your backbone."

326
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:30,674
But they broke my back,
they broke my heart.

327
00:33:30,841 --> 00:33:33,761
Cursed be the day
where I married.

328
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:37,097
Why I started in this misery?

329
00:34:23,852 --> 00:34:25,437
I'm not him, boy.

330
00:34:26,021 --> 00:34:27,261
We just look alike, that's all.

331
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:37,116
But that must be a spider there,
not a cockroach.

332
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:38,450
Isn't that right?

333
00:34:38,617 --> 00:34:42,871
I do not need a spider,
I am Cockroach man.

334
00:34:43,038 --> 00:34:45,708
Why I need of a spider?

335
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:49,753
That's it.
I am Cockroach man.

336
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:54,216
What is your relationship?
With Spider-Man?

337
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:56,176
What is my link?

338
00:34:57,094 --> 00:34:58,554
I'm his cousin.

339
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:01,724
So you are his cousin?

340
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:04,727
That's right. His cousin.

341
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:12,276
- What's your name?
- Zain.

342
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:14,695
- Hussein?
- Zain!

343
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:15,613
Zain!

344
00:35:15,779 --> 00:35:17,197
Where are you going, Zain?

345
00:35:17,364 --> 00:35:18,949
To my grandmother's house.

346
00:35:19,116 --> 00:35:21,368
- Speak louder.
- To my grandmother's house!

347
00:35:21,535 --> 00:35:23,078
Your grandmother's house?

348
00:35:23,787 --> 00:35:26,373
Well, she's lucky to have you.

349
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:28,834
Me, nobody takes care of me.

350
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:32,129
- My life is...
- Please, the cigarette.

351
00:35:32,838 --> 00:35:34,256
Please.

352
00:35:38,969 --> 00:35:40,888
Stop, sir.

353
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:43,682
I'm going down here, please.

354
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:06,997
Wait, sir.

355
00:36:07,164 --> 00:36:09,291
I'd like to get off here,
please.

356
00:36:09,875 --> 00:36:13,295
Eat my corn
you will be my son-in-law

357
00:36:20,886 --> 00:36:22,012
Mr. Cockroach man?

358
00:39:23,485 --> 00:39:25,445
Is the owner here?

359
00:39:26,446 --> 00:39:27,531
Excuse me?

360
00:39:28,073 --> 00:39:29,241
Is the owner here?

361
00:39:30,075 --> 00:39:32,119
What do you want with him?

362
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:38,000
I would like to ask him for a job.

363
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:40,544
What kind of job?

364
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:44,590
Whatever,
the important thing is that I work.

365
00:39:50,762 --> 00:39:51,972
What's your name?

366
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,224
Zain.

367
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:56,101
Zain?

368
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,020
And yours?

369
00:39:58,312 --> 00:39:59,897
My name is Tigest.

370
00:40:01,523 --> 00:40:06,486
I could clean the floor
or do the dishes, for example.

371
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:08,488
I really do not know.

372
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:14,286
Do you need an employee?

373
00:40:15,537 --> 00:40:18,916
You need someone
to carry your fishing rod?

374
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,336
Where are your parents?

375
00:40:24,671 --> 00:40:25,714
Where are they?

376
00:40:31,845 --> 00:40:36,141
Sir, you would have a juice for 250?

377
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:39,227
Or something else for 2507

378
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:41,855
The juice is 1000.

379
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:45,359
- Anything cheaper?
- No.

380
00:40:57,454 --> 00:40:58,956
Go ahead.

381
00:40:59,706 --> 00:41:01,249
Take it, I tell you.

382
00:41:01,416 --> 00:41:04,086
Do not worry, take it.

383
00:41:39,746 --> 00:41:41,790
It's occupied, ma'am.

384
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:44,083
There too?

385
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:46,169
Yes, and that one is out of order.

386
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:09,211
Tigest?

387
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:14,508
Tigest?

388
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:18,011
You have something to eat?

389
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:19,262
Please.

390
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:08,812
Zain.

391
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:33,980
Here's the milk, OK?

392
00:45:37,442 --> 00:45:41,404
You give him one at 11 am,
then another at 2.

393
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:44,032
I come home at 3 pm

394
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:06,388
Don't leave the house, alright?

395
00:46:07,138 --> 00:46:11,851
Don't let Yonas cry,
the neighbor is very boring.

396
00:46:12,852 --> 00:46:16,231
Stay with your boyfriend.
I'm coming back, Yoni.

397
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:19,276
[Ethiopian]
This is your new friend, OK?

398
00:46:19,442 --> 00:46:22,570
Zain is your new friend.

399
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:27,450
Are you sleepy?

400
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:28,011
[Ethiopian]
Tell him you do not have the money.

401
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:33,725
I told him, but he does not want to do
my papers for less than S 1500.

402
00:47:34,517 --> 00:47:39,397
I absolutely have to renew them,
they will expire soon.

403
00:47:40,648 --> 00:47:44,069
Do as you can, but be quick.

404
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:49,741
Lots of girls are arrested.

405
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:52,077
Sometimes in the middle of the night.

406
00:47:58,541 --> 00:48:01,252
You stink shit, shit!

407
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:12,263
Stop!

408
00:48:15,266 --> 00:48:16,768
Take a seat.

409
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:19,145
Sit down, fuck!

410
00:48:37,330 --> 00:48:38,415
It fell over!

411
00:48:46,923 --> 00:48:49,676
Sleep, sleep

412
00:48:50,009 --> 00:48:51,302
Come on, go to sleep.

413
00:48:53,471 --> 00:48:55,974
But what do you want from here?

414
00:49:00,311 --> 00:49:04,732
Sleep, Yonas my little brother

415
00:49:05,608 --> 00:49:08,862
Sleep, sleep

416
00:49:39,767 --> 00:49:42,061
Come eat corn, honey.

417
00:49:43,605 --> 00:49:44,981
Bye, Harout.

418
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:49,027
Come in, enter!
Welcome!

419
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:53,364
Hot, hot, hot!

420
00:50:31,027 --> 00:50:32,737
Blow, blow it out.

421
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:37,784
Blow, Zain.

422
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:55,927
How old are you, Zain?

423
00:50:56,886 --> 00:50:58,429
I do not know.
12 years old, I think.

424
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:10,358
Do you have brothers and sisters?

425
00:51:10,817 --> 00:51:12,151
Many.

426
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:15,780
- You don't miss them?
- Yes.

427
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:19,367
The one I miss the most,
it's my sister, Sahar.

428
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:22,078
- Where is she?
- With her husband.

429
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:22,870
She's married?

430
00:51:23,037 --> 00:51:25,415
Yes, and there was drums
and a darbouka.

431
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:27,750
We had a party in the street.

432
00:51:27,917 --> 00:51:29,836
People were throwing
rice and flowers.

433
00:51:30,003 --> 00:51:31,546
Congratulations.

434
00:51:41,472 --> 00:51:42,765
Rahil Eresa.

435
00:51:42,932 --> 00:51:45,101
- Last name?
- Shifaraw.

436
00:51:46,811 --> 00:51:49,022
Do you know why you are in prison?

437
00:51:49,188 --> 00:51:50,481
Why are you handcuffed?

438
00:51:51,232 --> 00:51:53,610
- 1 do not have a residence permit.
- NO papers.

439
00:51:53,776 --> 00:51:55,778
Where were you working?

440
00:51:55,945 --> 00:51:57,905
I worked for a lady for 6 years.

441
00:51:58,072 --> 00:52:00,158
Then you ran away?

442
00:52:00,908 --> 00:52:02,452
She was not nice to you?

443
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:03,828
She beat you?

444
00:52:03,995 --> 00:52:08,416
No, she was very kind
but I fell in love,

445
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:10,251
and I got pregnant and I left

446
00:52:10,418 --> 00:52:11,418
You got what?

447
00:52:11,919 --> 00:52:14,589
I got pregnant and I left

448
00:52:14,756 --> 00:52:16,257
Say, you speak Arabic well.

449
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:18,301
Do you understand everything I say?

450
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:20,595
- Yes I understand.
- So no need for a translator?

451
00:52:20,762 --> 00:52:21,762
No.

452
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:25,308
So you're gone
so that Madame does not know.

453
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:29,729
I was scared of police,
they'd take my son and expels me.

454
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:32,315
I was scared and
I did not say anything to anyone.

455
00:52:32,774 --> 00:52:35,860
So, you left Yonas with Zain.

456
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:38,905
When you came home,
he had taken good care of him?

457
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:41,824
You never thought
that he could hurt her?

458
00:52:41,991 --> 00:52:46,996
I was scared the first two days,

459
00:52:47,163 --> 00:52:50,208
but afterward
I started to trust him.

460
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:52,835
Did you expect that
Zain do what he did?

461
00:52:53,002 --> 00:52:54,003
Never.

462
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:57,006
They were like brothers.

463
00:52:57,173 --> 00:53:00,551
But I never blamed Zain

464
00:53:01,219 --> 00:53:03,471
because I know Aspro.

465
00:53:03,638 --> 00:53:05,181
Who is Aspro?

466
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:07,892
The guy who forged my permit.

467
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:11,145
Souk Al Ahad

468
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:22,407
I gave you until today, no?

469
00:53:22,990 --> 00:53:24,951
But I talked to my girlfriend.

470
00:53:25,118 --> 00:53:29,038
Her papers get made for $900.

471
00:53:29,205 --> 00:53:31,624
Get her to make your papers then!

472
00:53:31,791 --> 00:53:35,336
No but why
this price difference?

473
00:53:35,503 --> 00:53:38,631
Stop your blah blah,
do not try to wind me up.

474
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:40,550
Calm down, that I can
place two words.

475
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:41,968
I'm trying to help you, here.

476
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:44,721
Who gave you the name of Tigest?
I did.

477
00:53:44,887 --> 00:53:48,808
Gallop at your girlfriend
who can you do them $ 900.

478
00:53:48,975 --> 00:53:49,975
Do not do the malign.

479
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:53,146
I beg you,
I could not find the S 1,500.

480
00:53:53,312 --> 00:53:55,940
Look at that!
Does it look fake?

481
00:53:56,107 --> 00:53:57,859
Nobody will entangle you
with these papers.

482
00:53:58,025 --> 00:53:59,152
The woman on this paper

483
00:53:59,318 --> 00:53:59,944
BOOM!

484
00:54:00,111 --> 00:54:01,505
She exploded into a thousand pieces.

485
00:54:01,529 --> 00:54:04,657
She had no one, no family.
Nobody has claimed his body.

486
00:54:04,824 --> 00:54:07,224
You will be able to remove your
beauty mark, Not need for it.

487
00:54:07,326 --> 00:54:08,745
OK, but give me a bit more time.

488
00:54:09,203 --> 00:54:12,665
Darling, I said you can save $1500.

489
00:54:12,832 --> 00:54:15,084
Give me Yonas and
you will have the license for free.

490
00:54:15,251 --> 00:54:17,587
Never say it again
the name of Yonas,

491
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:19,964
I'd never do that!

492
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:23,134
Your kid lives like a fugitive
in this country.

493
00:54:23,301 --> 00:54:26,804
The day they discover him,
they will expel you both.

494
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:29,766
You make him live underground
like a rat.

495
00:54:30,224 --> 00:54:33,644
He does not see the sun,
he will never go to school.

496
00:54:34,061 --> 00:54:36,606
I suggest you give him a family.

497
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:38,000
You will be able to see
him from time to time.

498
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:40,610
I know how to hide my son.

499
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:44,071
How to feed him and take care of him.

500
00:54:44,238 --> 00:54:48,951
I will not stop telling you:
"Your son died before being born."

501
00:54:49,118 --> 00:54:49,869
He does not exist.

502
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:53,414
Even a bottle of ketchup has a name.

503
00:54:54,248 --> 00:54:56,667
With a production date
and expiry.

504
00:54:57,543 --> 00:55:00,254
I can not hear that anymore!

505
00:55:00,421 --> 00:55:02,465
How much are you short?

506
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:05,927
'S 500.
- You're short § 500?

507
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:08,471
I can buy a human being 500 S.

508
00:55:09,263 --> 00:55:11,766
So you don't think
that Aspro is a crook,

509
00:55:11,933 --> 00:55:15,102
ll give you a reduction of S 200.

510
00:55:15,561 --> 00:55:16,813
And I give you 7 more days.

511
00:55:17,271 --> 00:55:19,690
Either you come here with the money,
or with your son,

512
00:55:19,857 --> 00:55:23,653
either I never want to see
your pretty face here again.

513
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:24,820
You understand?

514
00:55:26,322 --> 00:55:30,243
So take your time,
all the time you need.

515
00:56:17,665 --> 00:56:19,041
Look.

516
00:56:21,752 --> 00:56:24,755
"Hello man.
How are you, buddy? “

517
00:56:25,131 --> 00:56:26,591
"Doing well, my brother"

518
00:56:26,757 --> 00:56:29,594
"1 saw you rolling a joint.”

519
00:56:30,052 --> 00:56:31,052
Me?

520
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:33,055
"Your mother is a big bitch."”

521
00:56:33,222 --> 00:56:34,515
"What a jerk of piss.”

522
00:56:36,267 --> 00:56:38,060
"Cocksucker thing."

523
00:56:38,436 --> 00:56:39,896
"Stop your bullshit, fool

524
00:56:40,062 --> 00:56:42,523
Bastard!

525
00:56:44,525 --> 00:56:45,818
"Damn, your mother is ugly.”

526
00:56:47,653 --> 00:56:51,073
Close your damn window!
I'm tired of feeling your food!

527
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:54,410
I'm going to make her eat shit
if she continues to annoy you.

528
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:57,246
I kill her or what?

529
00:56:58,289 --> 00:57:01,584
What a shit, that bitch

530
00:57:02,293 --> 00:57:03,419
Slut, whore

531
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:04,921
Are you going to...

532
00:57:10,092 --> 00:57:12,845
[ Ethiopian] is enough,
you need to get my pay!

533
00:57:13,012 --> 00:57:16,349
You know the guy.
It was you who found the job for me.

534
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:23,105
I'm not the owner,
ll cannot give you the money.

535
00:57:23,272 --> 00:57:25,983
If it was up to me,
I would have given you the money.

536
00:57:26,150 --> 00:57:28,819
I am Tigest, you know me?

537
00:57:29,278 --> 00:57:30,821
You know me?

538
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:34,492
Come back in the afternoon,
maybe the boss will be there.

539
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:53,010
No, not in advance.
We are at the beginning of the month.

540
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:57,556
You are illegal,
I already take a lot of risks.

541
00:57:58,140 --> 00:58:01,143
Please, 1 will do what you want.

542
00:58:33,801 --> 00:58:35,386
Here is the identity card
of the boss.

543
00:58:35,553 --> 00:58:39,473
I stole it for you. And you know
how much she trusts me

544
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:42,685
It is not serious,
it's for the little one.

545
00:58:43,185 --> 00:58:45,372
You know what will happen to us
if they learn our story?

546
00:58:45,396 --> 00:58:47,023
They will expel you with the little one.

547
00:58:47,189 --> 00:58:49,859
And God knows what they will do with me.

548
00:58:50,317 --> 00:58:52,319
I am only a simple guardian.

549
00:58:52,486 --> 00:58:54,131
They will replace me
in the blink of an eye.

550
00:58:54,155 --> 00:58:56,782
- You do not even want to see his picture?
- I can not.

551
00:58:56,949 --> 00:58:58,659
I beg you, leave.

552
00:58:59,910 --> 00:59:02,455
Before, I worked at a lady's house.

553
00:59:02,621 --> 00:59:05,291
Then, I ran away.

554
00:59:06,083 --> 00:59:09,712
So, she has to pretend
she's my old boss.

555
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:12,256
And to say that she
doesn't want me anymore.

556
00:59:12,423 --> 00:59:14,091
She does not want you anymore.

557
00:59:14,258 --> 00:59:17,094
She will say that she wants
transfer me to your home.

558
00:59:17,261 --> 00:59:19,972
So you will become my new sponsor.

559
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:21,891
My boss.

560
00:59:22,224 --> 00:59:24,185
That's Jacqueline.

561
00:59:24,351 --> 00:59:25,394
Who am 1?

562
00:59:25,561 --> 00:59:26,979
I am not Jacqueline but Daad.

563
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:29,732
I'm going to play Jacqueline's role.

564
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:32,276
You have to work for me?

565
00:59:32,443 --> 00:59:34,403
But I do not need an employee.

566
00:59:34,570 --> 00:59:36,781
Oh my God, I'm going to throw
myself out of the window.

567
00:59:36,947 --> 00:59:40,910
I can't pay for a maid.

568
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:44,830
I do not have S 500 to hire her.

569
00:59:44,997 --> 00:59:47,291
Do you see this cockroach?

570
00:59:47,458 --> 00:59:49,085
It already understood.

571
00:59:49,251 --> 00:59:51,754
If 1 ask it,
it can tell me the whole scam.

572
00:59:57,510 --> 00:59:59,595
As with all Lebanese

573
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:01,806
To resist and to transfer.

574
01:00:02,848 --> 01:00:04,266
Where do you live?

575
01:00:04,433 --> 01:00:05,643
Arax.

576
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:07,937
Apartment?

577
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:09,814
Khachik Papikian.

578
01:00:10,147 --> 01:00:13,109
You give me light, Mr. Harout?

579
01:00:16,904 --> 01:00:18,030
Thank you.

580
01:00:18,614 --> 01:00:19,698
Excuse me, are you smoking?

581
01:00:19,865 --> 01:00:21,242
No thanks.

582
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:24,954
Why don't you want
this girl anymore?

583
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:27,790
I have children in Canada,
may God bless them.

584
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:30,501
They want to send me a Filipina.

585
01:00:30,668 --> 01:00:31,877
They are better?

586
01:00:32,336 --> 01:00:35,214
- It's more prestigious.
- It's different.

587
01:00:35,381 --> 01:00:38,676
And you, you agree
to work for him?

588
01:00:40,719 --> 01:00:44,473
I want to sponsor this Filipina.

589
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:45,850
With everything.

590
01:00:46,016 --> 01:00:47,810
I want to help her.

591
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:48,977
She is Ethiopian.

592
01:00:49,061 --> 01:00:51,147
I want to give my wife her as a gift.

593
01:00:51,313 --> 01:00:52,731
What is your business?

594
01:00:52,898 --> 01:00:55,151
I have an electronics store.

595
01:00:56,152 --> 01:00:57,778
Whose name is?

596
01:00:57,945 --> 01:00:59,488
Haroutchum

597
01:00:59,655 --> 01:01:00,656
Electric.

598
01:01:01,323 --> 01:01:03,701
The address of your home
where the girl will reside.

599
01:01:04,118 --> 01:01:05,911
Dawra, Bourj Hamoud.

600
01:01:06,412 --> 01:01:07,412
Your phone number?

601
01:01:08,330 --> 01:01:09,748
09

602
01:01:11,458 --> 01:01:14,170
4,5, 6 Something like this.

603
01:01:14,336 --> 01:01:15,462
Something like that?

604
01:01:15,629 --> 01:01:17,339
This man is Armenian.

605
01:01:17,506 --> 01:01:20,050
You must not take him literally.

606
01:01:20,217 --> 01:01:22,845
Give me your correct number, 09 ...?

607
01:01:23,012 --> 01:01:25,014
- 3,4...
- 3,4...

608
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:26,974
- 5,6...
- 5,6...

609
01:01:27,141 --> 01:01:28,517
And then 7?

610
01:01:29,226 --> 01:01:33,355
He pisses us off and then
he offers us a coffee?

611
01:01:33,814 --> 01:01:37,276
Thank you,
we do not want your coffee.

612
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:40,321
Thanks my God,
he did not call the cops.

613
01:01:40,487 --> 01:01:43,282
He calls the police!

614
01:01:43,657 --> 01:01:46,493
Yes, I am the king of Hachich

615
01:02:44,009 --> 01:02:45,427
What's the matter?

616
01:02:45,761 --> 01:02:47,346
I look different?

617
01:04:08,260 --> 01:04:09,887
Where are you going?

618
01:04:10,054 --> 01:04:11,388
I'm going to call Mom.

619
01:04:11,555 --> 01:04:13,724
And then Souk El Ahad
to look for stuff.

620
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:18,187
[Ethiopian]
You're not alone, Zain is here.

621
01:04:23,025 --> 01:04:24,276
Everything '.

622
01:04:41,335 --> 01:04:42,335
"Later,” Zain.

623
01:04:42,753 --> 01:04:43,962
Bye.

624
01:05:09,071 --> 01:05:12,616
[ Ethiopian] I can not
send you money this month.

625
01:05:13,867 --> 01:05:18,205
I'm taking English classes.

626
01:05:20,833 --> 01:05:22,709
I'm sorry, Mom.

627
01:05:25,879 --> 01:05:28,966
My boss is so nice to me.

628
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:34,221
I'm ashamed to ask her for money.

629
01:05:35,597 --> 01:05:37,766
I love you so much, Mom.

630
01:06:01,165 --> 01:06:02,165
Rahil?

631
01:06:05,210 --> 01:06:06,210
Rahil?

632
01:06:09,631 --> 01:06:10,757
Rahil?

633
01:07:03,644 --> 01:07:04,770
Manara?

634
01:07:04,937 --> 01:07:06,188
Yes, ho in.

635
01:07:15,948 --> 01:07:17,866
I have not seen her since yesterday.

636
01:07:18,033 --> 01:07:20,244
I thought she was sick.

637
01:07:20,410 --> 01:07:24,289
She said she was going to the souk
and she did not come back.

638
01:07:24,665 --> 01:07:26,917
She may have gone to Aspro.

639
01:07:27,084 --> 01:07:29,419
Aspro? Who is Aspro?

640
01:07:29,586 --> 01:07:33,173
It has a booth Souk Al Ahad.

641
01:07:50,941 --> 01:07:54,987
Pullovers for only 2000 pounds!

642
01:07:55,362 --> 01:07:57,114
Sir, where is the Aspro shop?

643
01:07:57,281 --> 01:07:59,408
Aspro? It's there.

644
01:08:00,534 --> 01:08:02,744
The real Aspro?

645
01:08:07,583 --> 01:08:08,917
Rahil?

646
01:08:09,543 --> 01:08:11,753
What is your connection with Rahil?

647
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:14,131
- We are parents.
- Are you parents?

648
01:08:14,298 --> 01:08:15,507
Show me.

649
01:08:15,674 --> 01:08:16,425
It's clear.

650
01:08:16,592 --> 01:08:18,969
On the paternal or maternal side?

651
01:08:19,678 --> 01:08:21,638
This is her son Yonas?

652
01:08:22,014 --> 01:08:23,265
Is not it?

653
01:08:23,432 --> 01:08:25,475
What is Yonas doing with you?

654
01:08:25,642 --> 01:08:27,811
Rahil left yesterday.

655
01:08:28,312 --> 01:08:30,272
She has not come back since.

656
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:32,608
Give me Yonas.

657
01:08:32,774 --> 01:08:35,152
- No no...
- Why are you scared?

658
01:08:35,694 --> 01:08:38,113
It's my little Yonas!
I know everything about him.

659
01:08:39,197 --> 01:08:41,908
It's a little thug,
like his mother.

660
01:08:42,326 --> 01:08:46,538
Yasser, 2 falafels
for the two rabbits!

661
01:08:47,205 --> 01:08:48,749
You want to eat?

662
01:08:51,043 --> 01:08:53,211
You did not call her?

663
01:08:53,378 --> 01:08:55,005
I do not have a phone.

664
01:09:01,428 --> 01:09:03,138
His cellphone is off.

665
01:09:07,142 --> 01:09:09,436
Thank you, Yasser.

666
01:09:09,603 --> 01:09:12,147
- Come eat inside.
- No thanks.

667
01:09:12,314 --> 01:09:13,940
What do I say to her, if she comes?

668
01:09:14,316 --> 01:09:16,568
Tell her we're waiting for him at home.

669
01:09:16,735 --> 01:09:18,612
- Stay here.
- No no.

670
01:09:18,779 --> 01:09:21,281
Wait here with me
in case she passes by.

671
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:43,762
Excuse me!

672
01:09:43,929 --> 01:09:45,764
Where can I open this?

673
01:09:47,516 --> 01:09:48,975
Hold this for me.

674
01:09:59,653 --> 01:10:01,113
- That's it.
- Thank you.

675
01:10:01,279 --> 01:10:02,279
You're welcome.

676
01:10:07,911 --> 01:10:09,204
You are hungry?

677
01:10:09,371 --> 01:10:10,371
No.

678
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:11,581
Bon appétit.

679
01:10:12,165 --> 01:10:13,625
What's your name?

680
01:10:13,959 --> 01:10:15,127
Ibrahim.

681
01:10:16,211 --> 01:10:18,547
- And who is he?
- His name is...

682
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:20,257
Assaad.

683
01:10:20,799 --> 01:10:22,884
- And you?
- Maysoun.

684
01:10:23,844 --> 01:10:26,722
You stole it
or do you use it to beg?

685
01:10:27,222 --> 01:10:28,515
It's my brother.

686
01:10:28,682 --> 01:10:30,183
He does not look like you.

687
01:10:30,350 --> 01:10:32,686
We are all born black like him.

688
01:10:32,853 --> 01:10:33,937
And...

689
01:10:34,104 --> 01:10:36,565
With time, we get lighter.

690
01:10:38,150 --> 01:10:40,444
How much are these boxes?

691
01:10:40,819 --> 01:10:42,738
It depends on the car.

692
01:10:42,904 --> 01:10:44,781
Let's say a woman drives by

693
01:10:44,948 --> 01:10:48,243
Look at her hand,
if she's wearing a ring...

694
01:10:48,410 --> 01:10:51,246
You say, "May God protect you

695
01:10:51,413 --> 01:10:53,373
"and keep your husband.”

696
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:55,876
If she does not wear a ring,

697
01:10:56,042 --> 01:10:59,588
you say:
"May God send you a good husband.”

698
01:11:00,130 --> 01:11:04,217
Stop licking your hands,
they are too dirty.

699
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:11,201
Line-up over here, the Ethiopians

700
01:12:12,953 --> 01:12:14,496
You are pregnant?

701
01:12:18,124 --> 01:12:21,086
[Ethiopian]
You can not say anything!

702
01:12:21,253 --> 01:12:23,171
They'll take it from you.

703
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:47,821
[Ethiopian]
Yonas, my son, forgive me!

704
01:12:48,238 --> 01:12:50,740
For God's sake, forgive me!

705
01:14:03,355 --> 01:14:06,566
Do you have something
for a baby?

706
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:07,900
Yes.

707
01:14:08,693 --> 01:14:09,945
How much?

708
01:14:10,528 --> 01:14:13,198
For 250 or one at 1000.

709
01:14:13,365 --> 01:14:15,367
I take the 250.

710
01:15:13,216 --> 01:15:14,342
Taste.

711
01:15:17,721 --> 01:15:19,556
Just this once.

712
01:16:48,812 --> 01:16:50,021
No kidding...

713
01:16:50,188 --> 01:16:53,066
Isn't this better
that a shawarma sandwich?

714
01:16:59,697 --> 01:17:02,450
Do not swallow it whole,
you will get sick!

715
01:17:04,619 --> 01:17:05,662
Heeee!

716
01:17:05,995 --> 01:17:07,580
You swallowed it in full?

717
01:18:00,425 --> 01:18:01,551
Is it good?

718
01:18:01,718 --> 01:18:03,428
Enjoy it, big guy.

719
01:18:31,414 --> 01:18:33,041
No water?

720
01:18:33,875 --> 01:18:36,669
Fuck this shitty country!

721
01:18:40,215 --> 01:18:42,217
She does not ask about her son?

722
01:18:42,383 --> 01:18:45,136
Do not try to find out how he's doing.

723
01:18:45,595 --> 01:18:48,514
In fact, your mother is worse than mine.

724
01:19:17,126 --> 01:19:19,128
After you, Mr. Yonas.

725
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:20,546
Go ahead.

726
01:19:37,689 --> 01:19:38,689
Ibrahim!

727
01:19:40,233 --> 01:19:41,317
Ibrahim!

728
01:19:44,737 --> 01:19:45,738
Ibrahim!

729
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:50,243
What are you doing there?

730
01:19:50,410 --> 01:19:51,953
I sell these pans.

731
01:19:52,787 --> 01:19:55,039
These shitty pans?

732
01:19:55,206 --> 01:19:59,168
Better than that stupid
wreath you're carrying!

733
01:19:59,335 --> 01:20:01,045
It's for the graveyard, idiot!

734
01:20:01,212 --> 01:20:04,549
On the contrary,
I sell it in two seconds.

735
01:20:04,716 --> 01:20:06,009
They buy me everything.

736
01:20:06,718 --> 01:20:08,469
You want to bet?

737
01:20:08,636 --> 01:20:10,722
We bet a food dish.

738
01:20:11,139 --> 01:20:14,976
I want meat rolls
and Chich Barak. And you?

739
01:20:15,143 --> 01:20:18,771
I would die for a dish of
Chich Barak well hot

740
01:20:18,938 --> 01:20:20,273
My God...

741
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:25,903
<i>But not just a plate,
3 enormous one</i>

742
01:20:26,237 --> 01:20:28,948
Where does your
food relief come from?

743
01:20:29,449 --> 01:20:32,243
You talked about it last time.

744
01:20:32,410 --> 01:20:35,830
Ah, do you mean the dispensary?

745
01:20:36,372 --> 01:20:37,457
I can come with you?

746
01:20:37,623 --> 01:20:39,876
But no, you're Lebanese,
ll am Syrian.

747
01:20:40,043 --> 01:20:41,961
Where did you find this rabbit?

748
01:20:42,128 --> 01:20:44,213
Mind your own business.

749
01:20:46,132 --> 01:20:49,177
- You old goat.
- Let's go.

750
01:20:49,594 --> 01:20:51,429
Could you move away?

751
01:20:51,596 --> 01:20:54,891
- Or do you want to taste my fist?
- Come on, Ibrahim. Let's go.

752
01:20:56,893 --> 01:20:59,604
Anyhow, I'm leaving this country,
I'm outta here.

753
01:20:59,771 --> 01:21:00,771
Where to?

754
01:21:00,855 --> 01:21:04,233
I leave you the business
and all the rest.

755
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:05,568
All is for you.

756
01:21:05,735 --> 01:21:07,236
Where are you going?

757
01:21:07,403 --> 01:21:08,905
To Sweden.

758
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:11,532
There is a neighborhood
full of Syrians there.

759
01:21:11,699 --> 01:21:13,826
Nobody asks where you come from.

760
01:21:13,993 --> 01:21:16,788
They do not harass you,
nothing at all.

761
01:21:16,954 --> 01:21:18,956
I will have my own room.

762
01:21:19,123 --> 01:21:23,044
Nobody can enter without knocking.
Ll choose who can enter.

763
01:21:23,961 --> 01:21:27,507
In addition, children there
die from natural causes.

764
01:21:28,591 --> 01:21:29,801
I want to go with you.

765
01:21:29,967 --> 01:21:32,303
Of course, but you need money.

766
01:21:32,470 --> 01:21:33,846
How much?

767
01:21:34,013 --> 01:21:36,474
About $ 300. Not much.

768
01:21:37,433 --> 01:21:39,018
That's a lot, $ 300.

769
01:21:39,185 --> 01:21:40,561
You know Os

770
01:21:40,686 --> 01:21:41,938
Q-Spar?

771
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:43,480
Aspro?

772
01:21:43,815 --> 01:21:45,066
Yes, in the souk.

773
01:21:45,233 --> 01:21:46,401
What about him?

774
01:21:47,151 --> 01:21:48,694
This is his number.

775
01:21:49,987 --> 01:21:53,449
He's organizing the trip.
He gave me this paper.

776
01:21:54,492 --> 01:21:56,994
I drew a boat
Next to the number.

777
01:21:58,913 --> 01:22:01,624
It's a boat with pretty lights,

778
01:22:01,791 --> 01:22:03,000
good food.

779
01:22:03,167 --> 01:22:05,002
Assaad can come too?

780
01:22:06,003 --> 01:22:07,839
Does he know how to swim?

781
01:22:08,214 --> 01:22:09,549
I will help him.

782
01:22:09,924 --> 01:22:13,052
I do not know.
You have to ask Ospro.

783
01:22:13,219 --> 01:22:15,096
Aspro, not Ospro.

784
01:22:16,222 --> 01:22:17,723
Aspro.

785
01:22:20,351 --> 01:22:22,186
"Where are you from?"

786
01:22:22,562 --> 01:22:23,914
[Syrian accent]
"Where are you from?"

787
01:22:23,938 --> 01:22:26,399
[Syrian accent]
"Me? From Syria.”

788
01:22:26,566 --> 01:22:28,317
"Where in Syria?”

789
01:22:28,484 --> 01:22:29,819
Alep

790
01:22:30,611 --> 01:22:33,156
- "This is your brother?"
- "Yes, he's my brother."

791
01:22:33,322 --> 01:22:35,575
[Syrian accent]
"1 mean, he's my brother.”

792
01:22:37,410 --> 01:22:39,287
"What is his name?"

793
01:22:39,704 --> 01:22:41,164
"Na wras."

794
01:22:42,081 --> 01:22:45,877
"It's been two days
that he did not eat or drink anything."

795
01:22:46,586 --> 01:22:48,129
"Why is he black like that?"

796
01:22:49,005 --> 01:22:53,134
"My mother drank a lot of coffee
during her pregnancy."

797
01:22:53,301 --> 01:22:56,262
"She drank liters of coffee a day."”

798
01:22:57,388 --> 01:22:59,223
"Where's your card?”

799
01:22:59,390 --> 01:23:04,187
I lost it while walking
by the river.

800
01:23:04,979 --> 01:23:07,231
You were strolling near the river?

801
01:23:07,398 --> 01:23:10,067
Yes, and the papers
fell to the water.

802
01:23:10,234 --> 01:23:13,070
I could not catch them.

803
01:23:13,237 --> 01:23:14,780
How did you come here?

804
01:23:14,947 --> 01:23:18,701
We were at home, in Syria,
when our neighbor

805
01:23:19,410 --> 01:23:21,579
He denounced us, I think.

806
01:23:21,746 --> 01:23:23,956
But I'm sure of nothing,

807
01:23:24,123 --> 01:23:25,583
but I suspect it.

808
01:23:25,750 --> 01:23:27,919
A shell fell on our house.

809
01:23:28,085 --> 01:23:30,213
We started crawling like Rambo.

810
01:23:30,379 --> 01:23:31,672
Rambo, the one who crawls.

811
01:23:31,839 --> 01:23:33,049
Have you crawled?

812
01:23:33,216 --> 01:23:35,635
Yeah, like him, in the trenches.

813
01:23:36,219 --> 01:23:38,554
Well, what do you want?

814
01:23:38,721 --> 01:23:42,767
What you can, but the essential,
it's milk and diapers.

815
01:23:42,934 --> 01:23:44,435
Milk and diapers.

816
01:23:50,024 --> 01:23:53,444
And maybe ramen
and vinegar crisps?

817
01:23:58,449 --> 01:23:59,867
Stand up.

818
01:24:02,328 --> 01:24:04,789
What are you looking at?
Stand up.

819
01:24:31,023 --> 01:24:33,609
What a Lamborghini!
Come here, let me see that.

820
01:24:34,569 --> 01:24:36,279
Rahil hasn't come back?

821
01:24:36,445 --> 01:24:37,445
No...

822
01:24:37,488 --> 01:24:39,657
ll mean, yes! Rahil?

823
01:24:39,824 --> 01:24:41,409
She came back for a while!

824
01:24:41,576 --> 01:24:42,368
For sure...

825
01:24:42,535 --> 01:24:44,662
What is this thing
that you're trailing behind?

826
01:24:44,829 --> 01:24:47,164
It's a nuclear bomb or a rocket?

827
01:24:47,331 --> 01:24:49,709
A brand new water tank.

828
01:24:49,875 --> 01:24:53,004
How much do you want for
this "brand new" water tank?

829
01:24:53,170 --> 01:24:55,339
- 20,000.
- 20,0007

830
01:24:57,383 --> 01:24:58,634
Yasser!

831
01:24:59,552 --> 01:25:02,555
Give this little 30,000
instead of 20.

832
01:25:03,723 --> 01:25:04,974
Yonas...

833
01:25:05,141 --> 01:25:06,684
Why does Yonas look so skinny?

834
01:25:06,851 --> 01:25:08,936
You do not eat?

835
01:25:09,312 --> 01:25:10,980
He looks sick.

836
01:25:11,772 --> 01:25:14,942
My God, you smell like a the dog or what?

837
01:25:16,485 --> 01:25:18,529
I've already talked to Rahil about it.

838
01:25:18,696 --> 01:25:21,949
I told him that a family
good people wants to take Yonas.

839
01:25:22,116 --> 01:25:23,868
They can take care of him, dress

840
01:25:24,702 --> 01:25:28,456
And you can put yourself $ 500
in the pocket.

841
01:25:28,998 --> 01:25:30,291
Sound good?

842
01:25:31,125 --> 01:25:32,125
So?

843
01:25:32,293 --> 01:25:36,088
It looks like you can help people
traveling to Turkey?

844
01:25:36,964 --> 01:25:38,466
Do you want to travel?

845
01:25:38,633 --> 01:25:39,967
I would very much like.

846
01:25:40,134 --> 01:25:41,677
Would you like to travel where?

847
01:25:41,844 --> 01:25:43,054
In Turkey.

848
01:25:43,220 --> 01:25:44,263
I mean in Sweden.

849
01:25:44,972 --> 01:25:48,809
- Turkey, Sweden, what you want.
- Which is nicer?

850
01:25:49,685 --> 01:25:51,979
You choose,
ll can even send you to the moon.

851
01:25:52,146 --> 01:25:54,690
If you can convince Rahil
About the boy.

852
01:25:55,900 --> 01:25:57,568
Okay, kid?

853
01:25:57,735 --> 01:25:59,111
That's it, boss.

854
01:26:01,364 --> 01:26:05,242
Take this and tell Rahil
that Aspro says hello.

855
01:26:05,743 --> 01:26:06,743
Okay?

856
01:26:07,495 --> 01:26:08,788
I'll ask Rahil.

857
01:26:08,954 --> 01:26:10,122
Yes, do it.

858
01:26:44,824 --> 01:26:47,076
Yonas, give me the clothespin.

859
01:26:54,959 --> 01:26:57,420
Do like me, to warm your hands.

860
01:27:11,434 --> 01:27:15,521
My little sister washed the clothes
because my mother was sick.

861
01:27:16,147 --> 01:27:18,983
So she washed the prescription
with clothes?

862
01:27:22,194 --> 01:27:24,155
I give you one card

863
01:27:24,989 --> 01:27:29,160
You'll have the rest when you pay me
the 3000 that are missing.

864
01:27:29,326 --> 01:27:32,079
One card?
Give me two.

865
01:27:57,438 --> 01:27:58,439
No.

866
01:28:08,657 --> 01:28:10,034
Go away!

867
01:28:10,785 --> 01:28:13,370
I see you moving forward,
I am not blind.

868
01:28:32,389 --> 01:28:35,351
Guys, are you coming to help me?

869
01:28:39,063 --> 01:28:41,941
Gulps of Tramadol,
are you into that?

870
01:28:42,525 --> 01:28:44,276
One gulp for 1000

871
01:28:44,443 --> 01:28:46,737
Help me to carry this thing.

872
01:28:48,280 --> 01:28:49,865
Come and help me!

873
01:28:52,117 --> 01:28:54,662
We will agree on the price, brother.

874
01:28:55,371 --> 01:28:57,873
Come on, hurry!

875
01:28:58,249 --> 01:28:59,416
Guys, he has Tramadol!

876
01:29:00,376 --> 01:29:04,129
- I have Tramadol by the gulp.
- Would you have Viagra or Simo?

877
01:29:04,505 --> 01:29:06,715
- Do you have Rivo?
- Farawla, Tradamol?

878
01:29:06,882 --> 01:29:08,551
- Free base?
- I'm in the juice business.

879
01:29:08,717 --> 01:29:11,679
It's Rivo, but in version juice.

880
01:29:15,182 --> 01:29:16,976
You sell us sea water,
little man?

881
01:29:17,142 --> 01:29:19,144
Nothing better than sea water, man!

882
01:29:19,311 --> 01:29:20,871
I have Tramadol by the gulp.
Interested?

883
01:29:30,656 --> 01:29:31,991
1,000 for a swig.

884
01:29:39,331 --> 01:29:42,585
Go on, choose the country of your dreams.

885
01:29:44,753 --> 01:29:47,256
Let's go to Sweden,
it's the most beautiful.

886
01:29:47,590 --> 01:29:49,925
We'll go with that fool Maysoun.

887
01:29:50,509 --> 01:29:52,261
In Sweden,

888
01:29:53,095 --> 01:29:55,806
nobody ever bothers you.

889
01:29:55,973 --> 01:30:00,269
You can even piss from the balcony,
nobody tells you anything!

890
01:30:09,194 --> 01:30:11,447
You pay what you owe him, bitch!

891
01:30:11,989 --> 01:30:14,074
Take your chick and break!

892
01:30:14,241 --> 01:30:15,409
I'm leaving, asshole!

893
01:30:15,576 --> 01:30:18,746
Go heat up your ass,
when it's well-cooked, eat it!

894
01:30:19,705 --> 01:30:21,206
Do not touch the kid, shithead.

895
01:30:21,874 --> 01:30:23,542
Get out!

896
01:30:27,338 --> 01:30:29,506
Go away!

897
01:30:31,091 --> 01:30:33,052
Get out!

898
01:31:43,998 --> 01:31:46,625
You will break the door!
What are you doing?

899
01:31:46,792 --> 01:31:51,005
Who is the son of a bitch who has changed
the lock and swing my stuff?

900
01:31:51,171 --> 01:31:54,216
Your things are right there.
Who are you?

901
01:31:54,383 --> 01:31:55,968
I have things inside.

902
01:31:56,135 --> 01:31:57,928
Your stuff is at the owner's.

903
01:31:58,095 --> 01:31:59,805
Where's this stupid owner?

904
01:31:59,972 --> 01:32:02,766
Go see where is hiding
your slutty friend.

905
01:32:02,933 --> 01:32:04,768
Otherwise, I call the owner.

906
01:32:04,935 --> 01:32:08,564
Give him a big kiss for me!

907
01:32:08,731 --> 01:32:11,442
Who are you with the other slut?

908
01:32:11,608 --> 01:32:12,608
I am her brother.

909
01:32:12,651 --> 01:32:14,653
What shit bag are you coming from?

910
01:32:14,820 --> 01:32:18,657
Bug off before I go crazy!

911
01:32:21,035 --> 01:32:22,828
I'll call the cops!

912
01:32:23,287 --> 01:32:24,455
You'll see!

913
01:32:26,081 --> 01:32:30,377
If 1 do not break the door.
Where is the owner, brothel?

914
01:32:30,544 --> 01:32:34,506
If you do not mind,
I break you in two!

915
01:32:34,673 --> 01:32:37,509
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Go away!

916
01:32:39,595 --> 01:32:45,350
1. Want. My. Fucking. Money!

917
01:33:36,902 --> 01:33:39,154
Stay here.
Don't move.

918
01:33:56,338 --> 01:33:57,756
Go over there!

919
01:34:27,494 --> 01:34:28,494
Go.

920
01:34:29,288 --> 01:34:30,581
Go back!

921
01:34:30,747 --> 01:34:31,915
Go there!

922
01:34:44,595 --> 01:34:45,846
Go there.

923
01:36:37,416 --> 01:36:39,042
Yes my friend.

924
01:36:39,501 --> 01:36:40,501
Listen

925
01:36:40,627 --> 01:36:43,338
I'm going to send you a little kid.

926
01:36:43,505 --> 01:36:47,134
He looks like a dog now,
make him look human.

927
01:36:47,301 --> 01:36:50,053
OKAY? I have to pass it.

928
01:36:50,220 --> 01:36:51,388
OK.

929
01:36:52,472 --> 01:36:53,181
Why are you sad?

930
01:36:53,348 --> 01:36:54,641
It's nothing.

931
01:36:54,808 --> 01:36:56,435
It's good, we agreed.

932
01:36:56,601 --> 01:36:58,437
Do you have your papers?

933
01:36:58,895 --> 01:37:00,230
Identity card?

934
01:37:00,397 --> 01:37:01,648
I dunno.
At home, maybe.

935
01:37:02,149 --> 01:37:04,192
I need proof of your existence.

936
01:37:04,359 --> 01:37:06,486
An identity card,
an extract of a civil status,

937
01:37:06,653 --> 01:37:08,864
a newspaper where there is your photo

938
01:37:09,031 --> 01:37:12,492
So that I can take you out
from the port of Beirut.

939
01:37:12,659 --> 01:37:13,869
Understand?

940
01:37:14,036 --> 01:37:15,662
No need to worry about Yonas.

941
01:37:15,829 --> 01:37:18,248
I love him, and I will place him
in a good family.

942
01:37:18,415 --> 01:37:22,294
And the people with whom you travel
will take good care of you.

943
01:37:22,461 --> 01:37:26,256
You remember Yasser
who works for me? Go see it...

944
01:37:26,423 --> 01:37:28,258
He'll send you for a haircut.

945
01:37:28,425 --> 01:37:30,069
Then you go home
and what are you bringing back?

946
01:37:30,093 --> 01:37:31,762
- Your papers.
- My papers.

947
01:37:31,928 --> 01:37:33,013
Okay?

948
01:37:33,180 --> 01:37:36,391
Here are one, two, three, four

949
01:37:36,725 --> 01:37:38,018
Here.

950
01:37:38,185 --> 01:37:39,811
But you promised me S 500.

951
01:37:40,020 --> 01:37:42,647
Do you intend to drink and eat for free?

952
01:37:42,814 --> 01:37:45,442
That's $ 100 for your food.

953
01:37:46,401 --> 01:37:47,694
Kiss Me.

954
01:37:48,111 --> 01:37:51,073
Take care of yourself. Go ahead.

955
01:38:05,921 --> 01:38:08,340
It's good, you can go.

956
01:38:08,507 --> 01:38:11,468
I told you that
I will take care of him.

957
01:40:03,205 --> 01:40:04,581
Zain!

958
01:40:06,291 --> 01:40:08,126
How long Have you been there?

959
01:40:08,585 --> 01:40:10,170
None of your business.

960
01:40:10,754 --> 01:40:15,634
Where did you go?

961
01:40:15,967 --> 01:40:17,219
Where did you go?

962
01:40:17,385 --> 01:40:19,763
Where? Where? Where?

963
01:40:20,972 --> 01:40:22,432
I fuck you!

964
01:40:24,518 --> 01:40:26,520
Anyhow, I did not come
to see you,

965
01:40:26,686 --> 01:40:28,605
nor to see that asshole there.

966
01:40:28,772 --> 01:40:32,192
<i>- Want my papers.
- Yes! Of course, my dear!</i>

967
01:40:32,359 --> 01:40:36,488
Selim, do you know the best?
Your son wants his papers!

968
01:40:36,655 --> 01:40:38,281
Where are my papers?

969
01:40:38,698 --> 01:40:40,742
Where were you all this time?

970
01:40:40,909 --> 01:40:42,494
None of your business.

971
01:40:42,661 --> 01:40:44,162
Not my business?

972
01:40:44,746 --> 01:40:46,623
Why do you want your papers?

973
01:40:47,499 --> 01:40:49,125
Do you want to work as a smuggler?

974
01:40:49,793 --> 01:40:52,837
My papers, my ID card,
no matter!

975
01:40:53,004 --> 01:40:57,175
Nobody cares about you or us.

976
01:40:57,342 --> 01:41:01,680
Do not play the little man,
you little asshole!

977
01:41:02,305 --> 01:41:04,766
Come, you'll see,
I will give you your papers.

978
01:41:12,399 --> 01:41:15,902
I have all kinds of papers.
You just have to choose.

979
01:41:17,988 --> 01:41:20,615
I have papers
that will make me rot in jail.

980
01:41:22,409 --> 01:41:25,745
I have an eviction notice.

981
01:41:26,913 --> 01:41:28,832
And that's the paper
Most important.

982
01:41:29,457 --> 01:41:33,003
Come.
Look at this paper!

983
01:41:34,337 --> 01:41:38,717
A hospital bill
that breaks my heart.

984
01:41:39,634 --> 01:41:42,596
We are less than nothing, my boy.

985
01:41:42,762 --> 01:41:44,472
Parasites.

986
01:41:44,639 --> 01:41:48,435
You just have to live without papers

987
01:41:48,602 --> 01:41:52,105
If not, I'll swing you through the window
and I'm done with it.

988
01:41:52,564 --> 01:41:53,940
You understand?

989
01:41:55,275 --> 01:41:58,403
Leave or I break your mouth.

990
01:41:59,195 --> 01:41:59,988
Let him go, Selim!

991
01:42:00,155 --> 01:42:05,702
Tell whoever sent you
I never got you papers!

992
01:42:06,703 --> 01:42:08,872
Return from where you come from!

993
01:42:09,039 --> 01:42:12,292
I fuck you and I curse
the day you are born!

994
01:42:12,459 --> 01:42:14,502
Who is in the hospital?

995
01:42:17,547 --> 01:42:20,383
Not a word Selim,
do not say another word!

996
01:42:20,759 --> 01:42:22,886
Who went back to the hospital?

997
01:42:24,346 --> 01:42:26,640
Who went back to the hospital?

998
01:42:26,806 --> 01:42:28,475
Who is in the hospital?

999
01:42:29,267 --> 01:42:32,187
Make him leave home or I kill him!

1000
01:42:35,398 --> 01:42:38,193
- You bastard!
- Who was at the hospital?

1001
01:42:39,736 --> 01:42:42,864
- Bummer!
- Who went back to the hospital?

1002
01:42:43,782 --> 01:42:44,574
Talk to me.

1003
01:42:44,741 --> 01:42:46,743
Who was at the hospital?

1004
01:42:55,585 --> 01:42:58,838
What did he do to him,
this son of a bitch?

1005
01:42:59,422 --> 01:43:01,174
What did he do to him?

1006
01:43:01,841 --> 01:43:03,885
What did he do to him?

1007
01:43:04,511 --> 01:43:06,846
Sahar is gone.
It's finish.

1008
01:43:08,932 --> 01:43:10,767
She left?

1009
01:43:11,643 --> 01:43:14,229
She left?
You will see what it is, to leave.

1010
01:43:17,065 --> 01:43:19,526
1 will show you who is what.

1011
01:43:19,693 --> 01:43:22,696
- Come back here, little asshole!
- He has a knife!

1012
01:43:22,862 --> 01:43:25,782
I'll fuck you,
if you do not come back!

1013
01:43:25,949 --> 01:43:28,034
Come back, doggie!

1014
01:43:29,035 --> 01:43:31,246
I will kill you with your bare hands!

1015
01:44:16,416 --> 01:44:18,209
Take off the handcuffs.

1016
01:45:22,524 --> 01:45:24,025
You are the husband of

1017
01:45:24,192 --> 01:45:26,027
- Sahar.
- Sahar.

1018
01:45:26,194 --> 01:45:27,862
How old was she when you married?

1019
01:45:28,029 --> 01:45:30,198
- 11 years old
- 11 years old?

1020
01:45:32,617 --> 01:45:35,328
A girl of 11 years
is able to marry?

1021
01:45:35,495 --> 01:45:37,038
She knows what marriage means?

1022
01:45:38,748 --> 01:45:40,917
From what I know

1023
01:45:41,835 --> 01:45:43,962
Yes, she can.

1024
01:45:44,128 --> 01:45:46,589
I mean she was "ripe" already.

1025
01:45:46,756 --> 01:45:47,382
Really?

1026
01:45:47,549 --> 01:45:51,094
I did not know she was a tomato
or a potato to be ripe!

1027
01:45:51,261 --> 01:45:53,680
Zain, calm down!

1028
01:45:54,639 --> 01:45:59,686
I did not know
that she could die from it.

1029
01:45:59,853 --> 01:46:03,940
Lots of girls in the neighborhood
get married at this age.

1030
01:46:04,107 --> 01:46:08,319
Even my mother-in-law
was married very young.

1031
01:46:08,486 --> 01:46:11,114
She's here, still alive.

1032
01:46:12,240 --> 01:46:15,618
When did she get pregnant?

1033
01:46:15,785 --> 01:46:17,579
2 or 3 months later.

1034
01:46:17,745 --> 01:46:19,581
Everything was normal?

1035
01:46:19,747 --> 01:46:22,250
At the beginning,
I did not notice anything wrong.

1036
01:46:22,417 --> 01:46:23,668
Then she started to bleed

1037
01:46:23,835 --> 01:46:25,753
She bled a lot.

1038
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:29,257
And what happened next?

1039
01:46:29,716 --> 01:46:32,802
We brought her to hospital
with her parents.

1040
01:46:32,969 --> 01:46:35,638
She died At the hospital gate.

1041
01:46:35,805 --> 01:46:38,308
We did not manage to get her admitted.

1042
01:46:42,770 --> 01:46:45,982
Can I know why
they refused to admit her?

1043
01:46:46,399 --> 01:46:48,818
Because she has no papers.

1044
01:46:49,277 --> 01:46:53,072
Master, that's enough.
You bombard her with questions.

1045
01:46:53,573 --> 01:46:57,368
I made the slave all my life
and you dare to judge me?

1046
01:46:57,535 --> 01:47:00,872
By what right do you dare to judge me?
Have you been in my skin?

1047
01:47:01,039 --> 01:47:02,332
Did you live what I lived?

1048
01:47:02,498 --> 01:47:05,084
No never,
and you will never live it!

1049
01:47:05,251 --> 01:47:07,462
Not even in your worst nightmares.

1050
01:47:07,629 --> 01:47:09,672
In my place,
you would have hanged yourself!

1051
01:47:10,924 --> 01:47:14,218
You imagine having to feed your children
water and sugar,

1052
01:47:14,385 --> 01:47:16,930
because you do not have
nothing else to give them.

1053
01:47:17,096 --> 01:47:20,183
I am ready to commit 100 crimes
to keep my kids alive!

1054
01:47:20,350 --> 01:47:21,726
These are my children.

1055
01:47:21,893 --> 01:47:25,104
Nobody has the right to judge me.
Ll am my own judge.

1056
01:47:25,271 --> 01:47:27,190
The flesh of my flesh!

1057
01:47:27,941 --> 01:47:29,609
You hear me?

1058
01:47:40,954 --> 01:47:43,915
The Syrian, Hussein

1059
01:47:44,832 --> 01:47:46,793
The Egyptian, Mohammad

1060
01:48:01,724 --> 01:48:04,185
Could we have your attention?

1061
01:48:04,352 --> 01:48:07,563
We are there, with the priest,
to meet you

1062
01:48:08,147 --> 01:48:13,486
To have a good time with you.

1063
01:48:13,820 --> 01:48:16,864
To cheer you up a bit.

1064
01:48:17,031 --> 01:48:19,534
Come on, let's sing a song.

1065
01:50:00,093 --> 01:50:06,682
Zain Al Hajj, take your stuff
and go to the office.

1066
01:50:23,866 --> 01:50:25,701
Zain?

1067
01:50:26,577 --> 01:50:27,620
Zain?

1068
01:50:27,787 --> 01:50:28,787
Zain!

1069
01:50:30,248 --> 01:50:31,248
Zain!

1070
01:50:31,332 --> 01:50:33,584
What are you doing there?

1071
01:50:34,335 --> 01:50:35,920
Zain, where is Yonas?

1072
01:50:36,838 --> 01:50:38,089
Zain!

1073
01:50:38,589 --> 01:50:40,967
Zain, where is Yonas?

1074
01:50:42,051 --> 01:50:43,177
Zain!

1075
01:50:43,344 --> 01:50:44,637
Where is my son?

1076
01:50:44,804 --> 01:50:47,390
Where is Yonas? Where?

1077
01:50:48,766 --> 01:50:51,477
Who did you leave him with?

1078
01:50:54,856 --> 01:50:57,441
My son is alone!

1079
01:51:01,821 --> 01:51:03,281
His eye

1080
01:51:03,447 --> 01:51:04,615
from this side,

1081
01:51:04,782 --> 01:51:06,576
is blue, blue, blue.

1082
01:51:08,161 --> 01:51:13,249
- His two eyes are blue?
- No. This eye is brown.

1083
01:51:13,416 --> 01:51:15,668
And this eye is blue.

1084
01:51:36,731 --> 01:51:39,025
You are live on Freedom Forever.

1085
01:51:39,192 --> 01:51:41,694
Please lower the volume
on your television set.

1086
01:51:43,029 --> 01:51:47,658
I've watched your show
for a while now...

1087
01:51:47,825 --> 01:51:53,080
I know you always
tackle social problems...

1088
01:52:27,198 --> 01:52:28,366
How are you?

1089
01:52:35,831 --> 01:52:37,541
You're sick?
Did you catch cold?

1090
01:52:38,209 --> 01:52:41,045
Congratulations,
are you no longer in mourning?

1091
01:52:41,545 --> 01:52:43,631
Do not you wear black anymore?

1092
01:52:48,469 --> 01:52:51,430
Why do you hate me so much?

1093
01:52:52,598 --> 01:52:54,225
Eat them, Zain.

1094
01:52:56,310 --> 01:53:00,064
Why do you want me so much?

1095
01:53:00,481 --> 01:53:03,025
I can do nothing.
I could not do anything.

1096
01:53:03,818 --> 01:53:06,487
She was my daughter,
it's my pain.

1097
01:53:06,654 --> 01:53:08,614
Why are you here?

1098
01:53:12,702 --> 01:53:14,620
When God takes you something,

1099
01:53:14,787 --> 01:53:17,498
He offers you something in return.

1100
01:53:19,166 --> 01:53:21,294
What did he offer you, God?

1101
01:53:24,755 --> 01:53:26,382
I am pregnant.

1102
01:53:27,883 --> 01:53:30,428
You're going to have a brother or a sister.

1103
01:53:32,805 --> 01:53:34,098
I feel sick

1104
01:53:34,265 --> 01:53:38,019
I hope it's a girl.
It will be called Sahar.

1105
01:53:38,185 --> 01:53:40,855
Your words pierce my heart.

1106
01:53:41,022 --> 01:53:46,610
When you get out of here, she'll be
walking, playing

1107
01:53:46,986 --> 01:53:49,655
I do not want to see you here anymore.

1108
01:53:50,531 --> 01:53:52,742
You are without heart.

1109
01:53:56,746 --> 01:53:59,832
Leave me alone, I want to go out.

1110
01:54:06,464 --> 01:54:10,843
Since the death of my father,
I did not smile

1111
01:54:13,220 --> 01:54:17,058
This report on injustices
against children

1112
01:54:17,224 --> 01:54:20,394
deeply touched our viewers.

1113
01:54:23,105 --> 01:54:25,691
If you'd like to comment
on what you've just watched...

1114
01:54:25,858 --> 01:54:28,611
09658856.

1115
01:54:38,120 --> 01:54:41,248
Is there an adult
Next to you, Zain?

1116
01:54:42,666 --> 01:54:43,959
An officer.

1117
01:54:44,835 --> 01:54:46,337
An officer?

1118
01:54:46,670 --> 01:54:49,256
Where are you calling us, Zain?

1119
01:54:49,423 --> 01:54:50,800
From the prison.

1120
01:54:51,217 --> 01:54:52,385
I hear Zain's voice.

1121
01:54:52,551 --> 01:54:53,969
From prison?

1122
01:54:55,513 --> 01:54:56,722
What prison?

1123
01:54:56,889 --> 01:54:58,349
It's him!

1124
01:54:58,516 --> 01:55:00,851
Roumieh Prison for Minors.

1125
01:55:02,812 --> 01:55:06,857
Zain, why are you calling us?
What can I do for you?

1126
01:55:09,360 --> 01:55:12,029
I want to complain
against my parents.

1127
01:55:14,698 --> 01:55:15,699
Hey boys!

1128
01:55:15,866 --> 01:55:18,119
Zain is on television!

1129
01:55:33,342 --> 01:55:36,387
Zain, you're live.
What would you like to say?

1130
01:55:39,056 --> 01:55:42,017
I want adults to listen to me.

1131
01:55:42,184 --> 01:55:46,397
I want adults who can't
raise kids not to have any.

1132
01:55:47,148 --> 01:55:49,150
What am I going to remember?

1133
01:55:49,316 --> 01:55:53,112
Of violence,
insults or beatings,

1134
01:55:53,279 --> 01:55:56,115
of the chain, the pipe or belt?

1135
01:55:56,949 --> 01:56:00,327
The sweetest word I'm told,
it is: "get out, son of a bitch!"

1136
01:56:00,494 --> 01:56:02,538
"Bug off, piece of garbage!"

1137
01:56:04,748 --> 01:56:07,084
Life is a pile of shit.

1138
01:56:07,460 --> 01:56:09,753
It's not worth more than my shoe.

1139
01:56:13,424 --> 01:56:15,676
I live in hell here.

1140
01:56:16,135 --> 01:56:19,013
I burn like rotting meat.

1141
01:56:19,346 --> 01:56:20,764
How are you?

1142
01:56:23,851 --> 01:56:25,811
Life is a bitch.

1143
01:56:27,313 --> 01:56:32,109
I thought we would become
good people

1144
01:56:32,860 --> 01:56:35,279
and appreciated by all.

1145
01:56:37,490 --> 01:56:39,867
But God does not want
that for us.

1146
01:56:41,785 --> 01:56:45,539
He 'd rather we be washrags for others.

1147
01:56:52,087 --> 01:56:54,507
This child that you're carrying
will be like me.

1148
01:57:00,221 --> 01:57:02,806
Zain, what do you want from your parents?

1149
01:57:03,682 --> 01:57:06,310
I want them to have no more children.

1150
01:57:06,769 --> 01:57:07,769
Stronger.

1151
01:57:07,811 --> 01:57:10,356
I want them to have no more children.

1152
01:57:10,523 --> 01:57:12,000
You want them to have no more children.

1153
01:57:12,024 --> 01:57:13,024
Yes.

1154
01:57:14,610 --> 01:57:17,279
I do not think they will do
still children.

1155
01:57:17,446 --> 01:57:19,240
And who is in her belly?

1156
01:57:23,202 --> 01:57:25,120
He will be born, no?

1157
01:57:53,899 --> 01:57:59,321
We've discovered a depot
where 15 people were sequestered...

1158
01:59:32,748 --> 01:59:34,041
Stand on the line.

1159
01:59:37,294 --> 01:59:39,129
A little to the right.

1160
01:59:39,505 --> 01:59:41,090
No, the left.

1161
01:59:41,632 --> 01:59:43,133
I mean your right.

1162
01:59:45,844 --> 01:59:47,221
But that's my right.

1163
01:59:47,388 --> 01:59:49,056
And that's my left.

1164
01:59:52,101 --> 01:59:53,852
Lift the chin.

1165
01:59:55,437 --> 01:59:57,564
Look ahead.

1166
01:59:59,024 --> 02:00:00,150
Smile.

1167
02:00:02,111 --> 02:00:03,111
Smile, Zain.

1168
02:00:03,153 --> 02:00:06,407
It's a passport photo,
not a death certificate!
