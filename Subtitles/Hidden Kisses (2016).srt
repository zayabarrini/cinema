1
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,400
HIDDEN KISSES

2
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,840
- The end of the street will do.
- OK.

3
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,440
- How's my gear?
- If it's a geeks get-together, fine!

4
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not going.

5
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,240
I'm pulling your leg.
You're a handsome fellow.

6
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,560
I don't know anyone.

7
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,640
It's not easy changing schools
like that, but you're doing OK.

8
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,840
Already invited to a party.

9
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,840
- Spotted any nice girls yet?
- No.

10
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,920
Yes, you have!

11
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,920
I won't be the only one late!

12
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,640
See you in a bit.

13
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,880
- 'Evening, Chief.
- Hello.

14
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,960
- How's it going?
- Fine.

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,120
Hello, everyone.

16
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,560
Very well.

17
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,200
Don't get up, Thierry.

18
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,240
- Have a guess.
- What?

19
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,960
- Noise.
- The party?

20
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,520
It had to be us! What do we do?

21
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,960
Wait for a second call.
Don't want to embarrass our kids.

22
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,040
I'd like to know
what's going on, though.

23
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,720
- What's that?
- Chloé's profile.

24
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,680
She gave me her password,
in case of emergencies.

25
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,960
See, you're interested too.

26
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,200
They're having a great time.

27
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,720
- Look.
- Hang on, go back...

28
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,240
Is that Nathan?

29
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,440
Is that a boy?
Is he kissing another boy?

30
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,440
'Morning, Dad.

31
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
All right, kid?

32
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,920
Chloé's mum showed me
a photo of the party.

33
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,800
- What's that photo about?
- Which?

34
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,000
You, kissing a boy.

35
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,880
Oh, that's with a mate of mine.

36
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,520
We were a bit drunk,
it was just to amuse the girls.

37
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,680
- Were they amused?
- Yeah.

38
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,040
Nathan, we have an agreement.

39
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,480
You can go out, but no drinking.

40
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,360
We agreed that, right? OK.

41
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,120
We'll say no more about it, then.

42
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,160
Get ready.

43
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,080
It's a nightmare!

44
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,920
No, don't worry.
No one can recognize you.

45
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,880
See you this aft?

46
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,480
Why?

47
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,480
Just five minutes
so I can give you back your scarf.

48
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,560
OK, I'll call you.

49
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,080
Nathan!

50
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,760
- Do you know them?
- Yeah, sort of.

51
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,160
From school.

52
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,240
They're pretty.

53
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,200
They're OK.

54
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,960
- Go over to them.
- Nah, I'm good.

55
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,720
Shall we go?

56
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,040
It's that photo.
Tell them it was a joke.

57
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,920
Who cares? Come on.

58
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,880
They're laughing at you.
Go and tell them.

59
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,520
If you won't, then I will.

60
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,520
Dad!

61
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,960
Stop it!

62
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,480
I don't understand you.

63
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,920
- Don't you care...
- It wasn't a joke!

64
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,360
When I kissed him it wasn't a joke.

65
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,200
- What?
- I'm going.

66
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,760
We're only just getting started.

67
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,680
Yeah, it's great
but I'm knackered.

68
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,320
Don't go, meet me in the garden.
I have to talk to you

69
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,160
What do you want?

70
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,000
Look at this photo of the party.

71
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,400
Good morning.

72
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,560
Yeah, the new kid.

73
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,720
He's kissing another boy.
Look, it's the new boy.

74
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,600
Let me see.

75
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,400
Come on, get into class.
In class, everyone.

76
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,720
Good morning, Maxime.

77
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,920
Everyone in class!

78
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,920
Could we, just this once,
start a class in silence?

79
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,400
Nathan.

80
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,520
All right, everyone?
Can we start?

81
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:24,640
Today we'll look at how to represent
a function graphically.

82
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,600
Sorry.
I shouldn't have posted that photo.

83
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,800
- Who took it?
- No one knows.

84
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,240
Who's the guy?

85
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,640
I'm betting it's Julien.

86
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,000
- Is it?
- Aude!

87
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,080
Aren't you interested?

88
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,520
The graphic representation
of a function is all the points...

89
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,360
Tell us, was it Julien?

90
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,080
- I don't remember.
- I won't tell.

91
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,280
I don't remember!

92
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,080
Nathan, don't you think
you've attracted enough attention?

93
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,680
- Why doesn't Julien own up?
- It's obvious!

94
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,240
If I was gay I'd kill myself.

95
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,000
- We'd know if Lucas was queer.
- Nah, I say he is.

96
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,480
You ever seen him with a girl?

97
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,400
- You neither.
- What you saying?

98
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,840
What you saying?
Don't you call me a queer!

99
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,520
I'll take you apart!

100
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,080
Calling me a queer!

101
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,200
It's not me, it's Lucas.

102
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,920
Fuck right off!

103
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,040
Just 'cause Lucas is your mate.

104
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,040
I've seen them,
the way they look at each other.

105
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,120
Lucas and Nathan.
You can see it, it's obvious.

106
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,560
- Yeah, it's Lucas.
- It was them, snogging.

107
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,480
He's a fucking queer.

108
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,960
What the hell's got into you?

109
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,120
Lucas, sit down!
You too, hurry up!

110
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,720
Sit down, Lucas!

111
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,440
Who wrote this?

112
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,600
The other guy is Lucas

113
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,640
- Nathan, your nose is bleeding.
- I'll be OK.

114
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,720
- Actually, can I go to...?
- OK, off you go.

115
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,880
I know what's going on.

116
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,080
We all know about that photo.
But your behavior is inexcusable.

117
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,200
They're accusing me.

118
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,440
The real one should own up.
Eh, Julien?

119
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,480
Not wanting to go out with you
doesn't make me queer!

120
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,120
Ouch!

121
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,760
Are you aware of your language?

122
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:50,040
"Accuse"... "Own up"...
As if you're talking about a crime.

123
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,800
And the word "queer" is an insult.

124
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,880
What?

125
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:58,120
It's not an insult, it's just a word.
For having a laugh.

126
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,920
Words have meaning.

127
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,880
They can be violent.

128
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,880
If he wants to be like that,
it's his choice.

129
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,280
You think it's a choice?

130
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,400
Did you choose to prefer girls?

131
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,720
No, I didn't choose that.
They're attracted to me!

132
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,600
- Can I ask you something, sir?
- Yes.

133
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,600
Do you prefer men?

134
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,240
- What makes you think that?
- You stick up for gays.

135
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:35,080
And your style is a bit...
No, forget it.

136
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,600
Go on.
What's wrong with my style?

137
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,080
She means you lack
a bit of virility.

138
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,720
We're going to move
our thoughts higher

139
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:52,480
and discover the other prince
of elegant English writing...

140
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,640
Yeah, it's Nathan.
I'm at the factory.

141
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,400
You'll be OK, there's no one around.

142
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,160
I'll wait for you.

143
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,200
Call me back.

144
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,600
- Heard about his son?
- Yeah, glad I'm not him.

145
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,040
- Did you tell them?
- No, nothing.

146
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,000
- What's wrong? You're avoiding me.
- No, I'm not.

147
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,560
I don't feel like talking.

148
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,160
- Is she coming?
- You're always on about her!

149
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,520
Do you blame me?

150
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,760
Coming for a drink, Stéphane?

151
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,280
- Not tonight, I'm tired.
- All right, then.

152
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,720
You know where we'll be.

153
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:44,200
Dad, I was just passing.
I thought we could go home together.

154
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,440
If you get this soon, call me.

155
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,480
I'm still working. Don't wait for me.

156
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,400
Learn your irregular verbs.
You're just as bad.

157
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,320
- Can I have a word, Tristan?
- Of course.

158
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,320
We'll look at this again.
Get to work.

159
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,920
- Have a seat.
- Thanks.

160
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,800
Right...

161
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,200
You know me, Tristan.

162
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:42,200
I don't tell my teachers
how to run their classes.

163
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,800
But parents have called

164
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:47,520
to complain that you're talking
about homosexuality.

165
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,800
I wasn't.
I was talking about homophobia.

166
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,000
I can help them
to overcome their prejudices.

167
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,600
No, your job is to teach English.

168
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:00,040
Then invite an anti-homophobia
association to the school.

169
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,400
- The students are confused...
- Are you joking?

170
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:08,480
Can you imagine the general outcry
if I did that?

171
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:13,200
I have nothing against homosexuals,
I have plenty of gay friends.

172
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,160
Your private life
is your own affair,

173
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,520
but here you're just a teacher. OK?

174
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,800
Thank you.

175
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,560
You didn't tell him about your wife?

176
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,920
I don't have to publish a denial.

177
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,760
In my class
there was another name on the board.

178
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,480
Nathan got some stick,
a fight started...

179
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,040
- What name this time?
- Marco.

180
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,480
I don't think it'd be him!

181
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,320
What does that mean?

182
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,560
Do you realize what you're saying?

183
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,720
It's just a feeling.

184
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,880
- I wish we could help the kid.
- It's his fault too.

185
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,320
He should be more discreet.

186
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,040
What?

187
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,440
- What do you think, Catherine?
- I think...

188
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,160
I'll do my marking
somewhere quieter!

189
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,240
Catherine, wait.

190
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,960
Catherine!

191
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,160
Catherine, wait.

192
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,440
I know what you're going to ask.
The answer's no.

193
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,040
You can talk to Nathan.

194
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,360
I knew it!
So I repeat, the answer is no!

195
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,880
I'm sure you could help.

196
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:29,080
You're so stubborn.
I pity your poor wife.

197
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:33,120
You know what he's going through
better than most people.

198
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,880
I'm his maths teacher.

199
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,080
I can talk to him
about equations and geometry.

200
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,480
That's my remit!

201
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:43,080
You told me you'd hate to go
through your teenage years again.

202
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,160
Remember?

203
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,360
Maybe it wouldn't have been so bad

204
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,080
if a gay teacher had explained
that you weren't alone.

205
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,800
You don't realize
what you're asking.

206
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,880
What are you afraid of?

207
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,200
That you're outed?
The times have changed!

208
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,440
I don't believe it!

209
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,240
You straight people
think we're paranoid,

210
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,480
seeing homophobia everywhere.

211
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,520
You think a law about marriage
made it all OK?

212
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,880
The stuff I hear, in class,
even in the teachers' room!

213
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,840
You were there just then.

214
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,720
It was Nathan's fault
for not being "discreet"!

215
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,960
No, listen to me!

216
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,680
When I was a teenager,
school was hell.

217
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,680
And now I'm still in school
because all I can do is teach maths.

218
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,520
My family barely talk to me.

219
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,120
I've fought the loneliness
with my work.

220
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,680
I only talk about my private life
to a few close friends like you.

221
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:43,200
Because I've got 140 pupils
and 280 parents watching me,

222
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,640
and I'm 50
and I want some peace!

223
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:49,000
- And Nathan?
- He'll cope like I did.

224
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,200
He'll suffer but he'll get over it.

225
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:09,200
It's me again.
I keep getting your voicemail.

226
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,200
Can't we talk?

227
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,040
Call me.

228
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,360
You like that, eh?

229
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,040
Fucking queer

230
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,760
Wrong floor.

231
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,600
Turn it down a bit.

232
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,080
Why not say who the boy was?

233
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,200
I don't remember.

234
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,720
He's threatening you, right?

235
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,480
No one knows he's gay.
I won't give him away.

236
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,760
But in the meantime
you take all the stick.

237
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,200
School is hell, my dad ignores me
and I get insulted online.

238
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,560
But I don't care.
Know why? Because I'm in love.

239
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,480
- What are you doing?
- Telling you the truth.

240
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,280
- You can't be in love at your age.
- Oh, yeah?

241
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,040
You told me you were
at the same age.

242
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,440
That's...

243
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,240
different.

244
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,920
With this boy it's not serious.

245
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,800
I'm gay, get over it!
I'm your only son.

246
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,840
It's not easy.

247
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,800
It's not easy to have
a homophobic twat as a dad!

248
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,560
The other guy is Louis

249
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,280
I knew it was Louis, I knew it!

250
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,840
I spent that whole evening
in his arms.

251
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,520
That's enough.

252
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,000
You're spoiling
the atmosphere in here.

253
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,080
That's enough!

254
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,720
One more word
and I'll give you a test.

255
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,840
All right.

256
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,800
Memorized everything?

257
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:24,000
The idea is to be fast.
It makes the investigation easier.

258
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,520
Let's get moving.

259
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,280
Can I have a word?

260
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,600
- I'm sorry.
- You're paranoid.

261
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,520
A few colleagues are gossiping. So?

262
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,040
Do you think it changes
my opinion of you?

263
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,360
- I don't know, I...
- Stop.

264
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,520
Don't tell me I'd take it badly
if it was my daughter.

265
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,280
Yes, you're right.

266
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,360
I never saw it coming.

267
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,920
We got on so well.
Now that's all gone.

268
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,480
The way he talks to me now...

269
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,800
And what's wrong with me?

270
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:41,120
I never imagined
I'd take it like this.

271
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,800
I thought I was open-minded.

272
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,920
We supported each other.

273
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,040
When his mother died, Nathan said,
"We'll get through this, Dad."

274
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,720
But now...

275
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,080
we're like strangers.

276
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,760
He's still your son.

277
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,360
Why do you keep phoning?

278
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,920
I didn't write that on the board.

279
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,120
I know that.
It's some shit-stirrer.

280
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,280
I didn't need to come here.

281
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,960
That's not why.

282
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,200
I wanted to see you.

283
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,560
I feel so lonely.

284
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,000
You're there in class, but I can't...

285
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,040
I'm not like you.

286
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,240
That kiss was just an experiment.

287
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,880
I see.

288
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,600
You got my scarf?

289
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,000
I want to keep it.

290
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,760
I'm not the only one who knows.

291
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,080
Whoever took the photo does too.

292
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,640
Who are you texting?

293
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,360
My mum.

294
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,080
- Want to dance?
- No, you go ahead.

295
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,920
- What do you want?
- Come with me.

296
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,880
I'm scared too.

297
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,760
Is somebody there?

298
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,920
- Want to go in the water?
- No, you can if you want.

299
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,600
Come on, it's nice.

300
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,960
Training time, Louis.

301
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,240
Great legwork.

302
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,000
Go, go!

303
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,920
- Did I hurt you?
- I'm OK.

304
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,200
- Want to win this tournament?
- Yeah.

305
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,240
Then you have to work
on your weak points. Go!

306
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,320
It's all in your head.

307
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,160
That'll do for tonight.

308
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,960
So he said, "Corinne...

309
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:42,200
"Could I have a balance sheet
for Monday? No pressure."

310
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,600
No pressure,
but there goes my weekend.

311
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,600
How was your day?

312
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,920
Lumbago and so on.

313
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,480
Shouldn't have been
a rheumatologist!

314
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:55,040
Théo, be a good boy and eat up.

315
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:59,160
I met Laura's mum.
We talked about our lovebirds.

316
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,960
Oh, please!

317
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,400
- You are, aren't you?
- We're not married!

318
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,520
You're quite serious.

319
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,520
But no grandchildren yet!

320
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:13,440
She was telling me
about a new boy.

321
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,040
He's called Nathan.

322
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,480
- She said he's gay.
- What's that mean?

323
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,240
Eat your tomatoes.

324
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,240
- For the parents...
- Can't be easy.

325
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,000
Do you know him?

326
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:31,000
No. Well, just to say hello to.

327
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,520
Keep your distance.

328
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,480
Like in the ring!

329
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:39,000
You didn't see that coming!
Keep up your guard.

330
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,160
- Don't worry.
- "Don't worry..."

331
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,120
I'll show you "don't worry"!

332
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,880
Pass the ball!

333
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,360
Now the yellows attack.

334
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,400
Get into position.
Pass the ball.

335
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:05,760
- What got into you?
- Don't touch me!

336
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,160
Hands off, poofter!

337
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,640
- Don't touch me!
- What's got into you?

338
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,960
- Don't touch me!
- Hey, cool it there!

339
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,520
What's got into you?

340
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,040
He doesn't touch me!

341
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:19,040
Don't answer back.
Just go outside and calm down.

342
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,800
You OK, Nathan?

343
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,680
OK, here we go.

344
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,040
Hey, guys, look.

345
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:31,080
This scar.
A dog bit me when I was little.

346
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:34,400
Stop showing us your muscles,
you're exciting Nathan.

347
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,560
The girls' changing room
is over there.

348
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,640
He prefers watching us in here.

349
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,080
Have a good look!

350
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,000
Stop it!

351
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,080
Bastard!

352
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,000
Take that, you queer!

353
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,000
Nathan, are you OK?

354
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,160
Hi, it's Nathan.
Leave a message.

355
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,200
The school phoned,
said you're absent.

356
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:39,560
I'm not mad,
I just want to know where you are.

357
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,840
Call me back, please.

358
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:45,520
One of the suspects may be armed.
Good luck.

359
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,320
Excuse me.

360
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:00,640
- So what happened?
- A stabbing. A guy ran off.

361
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,200
- Any ID?
- No papers on him.

362
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:13,320
Tango 2 here, Rue des Bordes.
Man with knife wounds.

363
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:16,240
Send an ambulance
and inform the super.

364
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,240
- Got that.
- I had to run!

365
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,240
He dumped this.

366
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:26,560
Get back and fill in the super.
I'll stay here with Patricia.

367
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,640
Hi, it's Nathan.
Leave a message.

368
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,960
Nathan?

369
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,160
What's happened?

370
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,360
Show me. Show me, Nathan.

371
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,160
Show me.

372
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,920
What happened?

373
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,440
Talk to me, son.

374
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,360
Talk to me, I'm here.
Tell me what happened.

375
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,360
They beat me up, Dad. Him too.

376
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,080
Him too.

377
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,560
- Him too.
- Calm down.

378
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,440
I'm here now.

379
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,880
I'm here.

380
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,360
I'm here.

381
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,000
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here...

382
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,760
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here...

383
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,800
I took the photo.

384
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,960
Why'd you do that?

385
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,120
To get a reaction out of you.

386
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,560
I didn't think it'd go this far.

387
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,320
- Are you in love with him?
- No.

388
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,920
So why did you kiss him?

389
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,760
I didn't. He wanted to.

390
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:30,200
He's been after me
since he came to the school.

391
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,720
He was sticking to me
all that evening.

392
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,560
Kissing him
was the only way to get rid of him.

393
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,320
So I did.

394
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,280
But I'm not gay.

395
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:46,760
I couldn't care less about him.
You're the one I love.

396
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,120
I believe you.

397
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,800
Laura, are you staying for dinner?

398
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,160
Stay. I'd like you to.

399
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,840
How's Nathan?

400
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,000
He went to school this morning.

401
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:13,400
He said if he didn't go right away,
he'd never go again.

402
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,440
- What are you going to do?
- I don't know.

403
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,800
He wants me to keep out of it.

404
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,880
But if you'd seen
what they did to him...

405
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,600
I'm not a father
if I don't stick up for my son.

406
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,120
Is that for me?

407
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,400
We've been together for a year.

408
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,680
What's going on?

409
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,720
You're very quiet today.

410
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,160
Nathan, what happened to you?

411
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,880
He fell.

412
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,040
Nathan.

413
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,000
What happened?

414
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,440
I fell.

415
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:13,800
For the first hour
we'll finish looking at...

416
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,960
For the first hour

417
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:44,240
we'll finish
looking at probabilities.

418
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:50,720
No, I'm not going
to talk about probabilities.

419
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:56,000
I'm going to tell you about a girl.

420
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:03,280
This girl went to school every day

421
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,000
consumed by fear.

422
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:10,320
She did all she could
to avoid those who made fun of her.

423
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,960
Because...

424
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:19,000
she preferred other girls to boys.

425
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,240
And maybe this girl

426
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:27,400
would have felt less ashamed
if she'd known someone like Nathan,

427
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:34,120
someone as brave as him,
who dares to say he's different.

428
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:39,640
It takes courage
not to lie to yourself.

429
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,880
To meet the eyes of others.

430
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,200
Where's the courage
of those who hit Nathan?

431
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,640
- Miss.
- Yes?

432
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,240
Was this girl you?

433
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:02,200
How would you calculate
the probability that it was me?

434
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,720
I dunno.

435
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:07,240
When you toss a coin,

436
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:10,840
there's one chance it'll be heads,
one chance it'll be tails.

437
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:14,720
So the probability
of it being heads or tails

438
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,400
is one half.

439
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:21,640
Whether it comes out heads or tails
is the "outcome".

440
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,160
Not going for lunch?

441
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,840
When I was your age,

442
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:55,760
I spent hours at school
in a very dark place.

443
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:00,560
Sometimes I feel
I'm going through that again.

444
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,080
I don't want that for you.

445
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,080
You're in the right.

446
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:23,200
She just said she's a lesbian.

447
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,280
- Are you all right, Catherine?
- Fine, thanks.

448
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,960
Kiss me.

449
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,000
Kiss me!

450
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,640
All right! Put that telephone down!

451
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,080
Go on, move along!

452
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,640
What's got into you?
Usually, with people around...

453
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,800
Yeah, well...

454
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,240
Times change.

455
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:29,760
I'm not afraid of you.

456
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:41,000
What would you do
if I kissed you right now?

457
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:43,480
- You're mental, stop it!
- Kiss me.

458
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:46,480
- Come on, kiss me.
- Stop it, move your hand!

459
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,760
- Kiss me.
- Stop it!

460
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,400
There are people watching.

461
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,480
- You're scared.
- Get off!

462
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,680
Piss off.

463
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,920
I pity you.

464
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,480
I really pity you.

465
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,000
What do you want?

466
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,640
- Piss off!
- You think I'm going to shut up?

467
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,280
I'm not scared of you.

468
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:20,080
I'm not scared of any of you.
I'll take you on, one at a time!

469
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,480
The poofter isn't scared!

470
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:27,160
What's the matter?
Isn't that what you call me?

471
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:34,640
You're scared of everyone
knowing what arseholes you are!

472
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,720
That's what it is!

473
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,440
It's easy to beat someone up
in a gang.

474
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,560
But here, in front of everyone?

475
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:46,280
Come on, then!

476
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,360
Do it!

477
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,280
Come on!

478
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,560
You're scum!

479
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,200
Nathan.

480
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:12,240
Hi.

481
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,560
- You saw?
- Yeah.

482
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:18,480
"I'll take you on, one at a time"?

483
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,680
I didn't know what to say.

484
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:24,600
Get in.

485
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:28,200
Hi, it's Nathan.
Leave a message.

486
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:31,520
Nathan, it's Louis.
Call me back, please.

487
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:58,720
This is the only bit of the weekend
when it's just us two,

488
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,640
and you're working.

489
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:04,160
Yes, I have to do this balance sheet
for Monday.

490
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,560
No! It's crashed again.

491
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,960
I can't get the bloody table back!

492
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:11,200
Use Louis's computer.

493
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,600
- He'd go mad.
- He's not here.

494
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:17,640
- Do you know his password?
- No, but...

495
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:19,800
Try "boxing" or "Laura".

496
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:23,720
Know what mine is?
The name of my beloved.

497
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,600
- Really?
- Yeah.

498
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,080
I don't mean you!

499
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:02,920
I was just curious.

500
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:06,560
It's all everyone's
talking about at school.

501
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,720
So I checked out some forums.

502
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,360
That's all.

503
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,760
And those gay porn sites?

504
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:15,360
- I only looked once.
- You're lying.

505
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:18,080
We checked your history.

506
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,560
I don't understand.
What about Laura?

507
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:31,480
I'm talking to you! Louis!

508
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:37,080
I know these associations
are authorized to intervene.

509
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:39,320
But only I decide

510
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,680
whether to invite them or not.

511
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,120
But I'm opposed to it.

512
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:46,800
Not from conviction, though.

513
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:50,720
You know the parents will block it.

514
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:55,040
Nathan was beaten up
because we did nothing.

515
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:57,120
We can't let it happen again

516
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,880
on the pretext
of not upsetting some parents.

517
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,240
We're thinking of having a petition.

518
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:05,200
47 out of the 53 teachers
are in favor

519
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,960
of inviting an association.

520
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:11,120
- They're ready to sign.
- As will a majority of parents.

521
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:14,080
What do I tell the parents

522
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,680
when they accuse me of proselytism?

523
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:22,000
Tell them to look up "proselytism"
in the dictionary.

524
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:25,520
Then they won't use it incorrectly.

525
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:29,440
Sexuality isn't a doctrine

526
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,280
or a philosophy.

527
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,440
It's not a choice.

528
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,240
Put your gloves on.

529
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:42,880
Don't you want a family?

530
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,320
A normal family, I mean.

531
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,120
Do you want to be unhappy
all your life?

532
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:53,040
Living on the fringes of society?

533
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,120
I feel lost, Dad.

534
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:01,400
"I feel lost, Dad."
Do you know why?

535
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,920
Do you know? No?

536
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:07,680
Because up there you know
you're making a wrong choice!

537
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,880
It's not impossible to change.

538
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:13,040
Don't let that shit
get into your head!

539
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:15,240
You'll get over all this bollocks!

540
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,160
I've tried, Dad. I swear I have.

541
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:21,920
Tried? You've tried?

542
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,360
Look at me
when I'm talking to you!

543
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:28,400
Raise your guard.

544
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:30,840
Raise your guard!

545
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:33,560
Raise your guard!

546
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:35,080
Come on, box!

547
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,400
Come on, box!

548
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,200
Is that all you've got?

549
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:41,480
Come on, box!

550
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:44,360
Come on, get up. Get up!

551
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:45,600
Box!

552
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:47,760
You've tried?

553
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:49,920
You've tried?

554
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,200
Face me.

555
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,280
Face me! Punch!

556
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,200
That's it, like that!

557
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:02,600
Go on, punch!

558
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:04,720
Do you want
to win this tournament?

559
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,720
Do you want to win or not?

560
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,760
Get up! Come on, get up!

561
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:12,560
There! There, there, there!

562
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:20,440
You've tried?
Well, you'll keep trying!

563
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,960
No more phone! No more Internet!

564
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,680
You agreed, didn't you?

565
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:48,680
He stays at the house.
We have to fix this.

566
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:51,600
He has to go to school.

567
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:55,200
I'll write him a note.
He can be off sick for a few days.

568
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,800
Anyway, it's not really a lie.

569
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:04,880
- Is that the solution?
- You want him to stay like that?

570
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:08,360
No? Then stop
protecting him like that.

571
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:11,000
We can't let him ruin his life.

572
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:13,800
Only we can show him
where he's going wrong.

573
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,800
He needs time

574
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,280
to start to understand, that's all.

575
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:25,640
I'm sorry.

576
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,080
Do you trust me?

577
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,400
Yes, I trust you.

578
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:39,240
I'll get it.

579
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:48,120
- Hello.
- Hello, Laura.

580
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,800
I've come to see Louis.

581
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:53,640
He's not been replying to my texts.

582
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:55,920
He's in bed with a fever.

583
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,960
A really bad sore throat.

584
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:00,040
Can I see him?

585
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:02,040
Do you want to catch it?

586
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:05,040
Don't worry.
He'll soon be back on his feet.

587
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:07,120
- I'll tell him you called.
- Thanks.

588
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:08,760
Goodbye.

589
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:17,080
Coming!

590
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:24,600
Did you think I'd forgotten?

591
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:32,840
Sixteen!
That calls for a celebration.

592
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:34,720
Cool.

593
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:40,120
Just this once.

594
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,240
Blow! We don't want to eat wax.

595
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,000
Blow them out.

596
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:07,480
If you want to invite any mates
this weekend, go ahead.

597
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,200
No, I'm good.

598
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:22,640
Is it Louis?

599
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,200
You'll have to talk to him.

600
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:30,400
I don't care about him any more.

601
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:00,520
I'm not gay. I'm not gay.

602
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:13,200
But, Dad...

603
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:14,800
What? Come on.

604
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:17,040
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

605
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:25,840
Gentlemen.

606
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:29,800
Allow me to introduce my son, Nathan.

607
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,800
Hi, Nathan. I'm Serge.

608
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:37,800
I'm Marc.

609
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:39,080
Pleased to meet you.

610
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:43,960
Here, have a seat.
Welcome to our home!

611
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:47,360
It's our home away from home.

612
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:50,160
So, what do you do?
Still at school?

613
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:51,560
Two years to go.

614
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:53,840
A word of advice: keep studying.

615
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:57,400
- Otherwise you'll end up like us!
- We're not doing so bad.

616
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:00,760
You had your goth phase
as a teenager.

617
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:03,840
This was the same.

618
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:07,120
It was just to wind you up.

619
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:09,920
But I'm not really gay.

620
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:13,400
A crap idea, I know.

621
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,080
I know I've hurt you.

622
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:17,800
And Laura?

623
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:22,920
My love for her has helped me.

624
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,000
What's going on?

625
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,920
It was just to wind you up.

626
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:33,480
It's not true.

627
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,200
Forgive me.

628
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:38,840
Let him call Laura.

629
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,560
Have you used your phone?

630
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:55,960
- No.
- No? Are you sure?

631
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:58,120
I just tried to call Laura.

632
00:55:58,360 --> 00:55:59,360
Nathan...

633
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:01,080
Nathan...

634
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,280
But no calls to Laura.

635
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:08,160
Take your phone and your computer!

636
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,880
Go and see who you like!

637
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:12,840
But don't try to talk to us!

638
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:15,760
Lying to us!

639
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,480
Treating us like your enemies!

640
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,600
From now on, we're ignoring you!

641
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,240
- Eat up.
- Don't like it!

642
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:26,480
Eat it.

643
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:30,280
- Where are you going?
- For the salad.

644
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:44,760
I can't eat on my own all the time.

645
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:47,280
I've done nothing wrong.

646
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:49,920
I had to lie.

647
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:53,120
He went totally mental.

648
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:58,040
Mum, talk to me, please.

649
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:08,200
I'll change.
I swear I'll change.

650
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:13,080
- But talk to me.
- Can I have a drink of water?

651
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:20,440
You scared me.
Are you spying on me?

652
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,320
I'm afraid you'll weaken.

653
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:25,960
- This is too hard.
- Do you think it's easy for me?

654
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:32,080
We have to hold out.
It's just a question of time.

655
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,040
- OK, little bro?
- Yes.

656
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:47,400
Théo.

657
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:51,560
- Come out of there, Théo.
- I want a cuddle.

658
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,120
Come here.

659
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:57,840
Come away from your brother.

660
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:02,400
Théo!

661
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:09,160
I'll read you a story.

662
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:30,160
Leave me alone for fuck sake!
You're dead to me!

663
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:11,840
What's going on?

664
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:13,520
I'm leaving.

665
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:17,080
- I'm never going home again.
- Tell me what's happened.

666
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:21,080
My parents have gone mad.
They hate me.

667
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:22,880
Because of the photo?

668
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:28,200
Answer me. Is that why?

669
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:32,520
Are you really gay, is that it?

670
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:38,160
Is it my fault?

671
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:42,160
Is it because you think I'm ugly?

672
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:45,440
Or because I don't kiss well?

673
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,400
What can I do?

674
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:55,080
I need money, Laura.

675
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,440
You have to lend me some.

676
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,920
- Dad.
- What?

677
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:49,880
I need your help.

678
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:52,800
- No idea where he might be?
- No.

679
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:55,000
Try and concentrate.

680
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:58,200
Did you hear anything?
What did he say?

681
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:01,960
- I think I heard a train.
- A train? Are you sure?

682
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:04,160
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

683
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:05,920
OK, we'll go to the bridge.

684
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,160
There's the old factory as well.

685
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:25,880
A description?

686
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:27,560
Blond, 16,

687
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:29,880
average height.

688
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,040
I'll let you know.

689
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:33,760
Go! I'll explain.

690
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,520
Sorry.

691
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:04,040
This is where we meet up.

692
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:07,040
There he is!

693
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:15,520
Louis, don't do it!

694
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:18,720
Leave me alone!
Don't come any closer!

695
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:21,640
Louis, I just want to talk to you.

696
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:23,360
I've nothing to say!

697
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:29,320
There are people who care about you.

698
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:32,280
Your little brother, your parents...

699
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:36,840
That's not true!
I'm already dead to my parents!

700
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:41,720
They treat me like a piece of shit!
They hate me!

701
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:43,760
That's not true.

702
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:58,960
Louis.

703
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:03,840
Look at me.

704
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:08,520
Louis.

705
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:14,080
Look at me.

706
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:16,080
Take my hand.

707
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:23,400
Take my hand.

708
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:32,920
Take my hand.

709
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:21,040
Yeah.

710
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:28,080
I've never been
so scared in my life.

711
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:31,400
OK, Serge, see you tomorrow.
Thanks.

712
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:34,960
I'll take you home.

713
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:37,080
I can't go back there.

714
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:39,640
You have to go home.

715
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:44,040
Can't we put him up for tonight?
It can wait till tomorrow, can't it?

716
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:49,840
Here.

717
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
There.

718
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:57,560
Nathan.

719
01:04:58,080 --> 01:04:59,080
But, Dad, I...

720
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:02,360
It's late, we all need to sleep.

721
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:03,880
Go on.

722
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:07,920
I'll pop in to see you.

723
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:11,600
Will you be OK, Louis?

724
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:14,880
I'll be OK.

725
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:19,120
If you need anything,
to talk or...

726
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:20,800
I'm in the next room, OK?

727
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:24,040
OK, thanks.

728
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:30,760
I'll be fine. Really.

729
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:35,480
Try to get some sleep.

730
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:07,760
Nathan.

731
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:14,280
I can't sleep.

732
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:16,440
Come in.

733
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:25,000
I was eight. My grandparents
came to the house a lot.

734
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:27,400
They always gave me funny looks.

735
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:32,240
I knew I'd never be like other boys.

736
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:36,200
But I didn't want
to cause trouble for my parents.

737
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:38,920
I had to put pressure on myself,

738
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:40,800
become paranoid.

739
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:45,440
When I started going out with Laura
my parents were reassured.

740
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:50,560
Then you turned up.

741
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:58,080
We have a new student: Nathan.
Please give him a warm welcome.

742
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:00,800
I'd never felt
anything like that before.

743
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:03,840
Let's carry on
with the "I have a dream" speech...

744
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:05,920
I felt so embarrassed.

745
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:08,760
I didn't know what to do.

746
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:16,800
You didn't throw it away?

747
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:20,440
No.

748
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:27,040
- What are you doing?
- It's your smell.

749
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:31,840
Seeing them in each other's arms
gave me a weird feeling.

750
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:33,920
I felt sort of...

751
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:35,680
stunned.

752
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:41,480
I'm just getting used to the idea.
Couldn't he take it slowly?

753
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:47,480
One step at a time, slowly.

754
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:49,760
Well...

755
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:55,400
I'd better go.

756
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:58,680
I hope I didn't wake Chloé.

757
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:02,600
No, she's not here.
She's at her dad's.

758
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:04,200
Well...

759
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:11,680
Stay.

760
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:29,160
Good morning.

761
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:34,440
- Are you going?
- Yeah.

762
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:36,400
See you later, then.

763
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:37,960
See you.

764
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:41,400
What do we do at work?

765
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:43,800
I don't know.

766
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:46,480
- Who cares, eh?
- Yeah!

767
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:56,680
- Hi, Dad.
- Good morning.

768
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:09,040
- I bet you wondered why Louis...
- Don't bother.

769
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:17,920
Did you...?

770
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,080
No.

771
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:23,960
I knew we'd have
this conversation one day.

772
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:25,800
I'd even prepared a speech.

773
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,640
But I'd expected it'd be for a girl.

774
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:33,040
What would you have said?

775
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:36,800
I'd have told you
about my first time.

776
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:39,920
I was still at school.

777
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,840
We were pretty nervous.

778
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:43,600
We took our time.

779
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:48,600
That first time was magical
because we were in love.

780
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:51,760
That works as a speech.

781
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:54,120
Yeah, you're right.

782
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:56,920
'Morning.

783
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,240
Good morning.

784
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:02,160
- Help yourself, Louis.
- Thank you, sir.

785
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:04,400
Call me Stéphane.

786
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:08,080
- Stéphane.
- Yes?

787
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:13,480
- When will you call my parents?
- I already have.

788
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:14,720
Your mother.

789
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:18,240
That must be her now.

790
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:19,760
I'll go.

791
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:27,480
It's Louis's dad.
Tell him I'm waiting downstairs.

792
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:30,280
- Come on up.
- I'd rather not.

793
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:31,960
Tell him to come down.

794
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:50,040
Where's Louis?

795
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:54,000
- Can we have a word?
- There's no point. Where is he?

796
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:57,320
Do you know what he nearly did?

797
01:11:57,400 --> 01:12:00,560
Look, I know how you helped,
and I'm grateful.

798
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:02,760
But it's none of your business now.

799
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:05,120
He told me how things are.

800
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:08,000
Are you going to teach me
how to raise my son?

801
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:09,080
No.

802
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:12,720
I know how you feel.
I was angry too.

803
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:15,840
If he doesn't come down now,
it'll end badly for you.

804
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:18,040
Louis.

805
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:23,880
- I'm causing trouble for your dad.
- You can't go back.

806
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:28,400
It'll be OK.

807
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:30,600
I feel strong now.

808
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:36,600
Thanks for everything, Stéphane.

809
01:12:58,360 --> 01:12:59,840
I've locked him in.

810
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:02,120
Do you know what he tried to do?

811
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:04,560
That's why I've locked him in.

812
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:06,520
To stop him doing it again.

813
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:09,520
- Give me the key.
- Not now, Corinne.

814
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,880
Stop it! Give me the key!

815
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:14,840
I have appointments.
I'll be back in two hours.

816
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:17,840
We'll talk to him together, OK?

817
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:20,400
Corinne... do you trust me?

818
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:24,040
Do you trust me, yes or no?

819
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:47,480
No, I'm not at work today
but go ahead.

820
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:53,000
Yes, call him from me.

821
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:56,720
I've got his number.
Hang on a sec...

822
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:12,200
Can I call you back?

823
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:29,920
- Louis!
- What?

824
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,200
I'm going to smash the door in.

825
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:49,160
I'm sorry.

826
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:51,000
I'm sorry!

827
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:02,880
- Is my husband around?
- He's with a patient.

828
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:04,360
All right.

829
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:15,880
Goodbye.

830
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:22,440
- What are you doing here?
- We have to talk.

831
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:24,720
- Can't it wait?
- No, it can't.

832
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:30,880
What's going on?
Have you left Louis alone?

833
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:35,920
I won't let you
go on abusing him.

834
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:38,000
Abusing him?

835
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:39,840
What are you saying?

836
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:43,040
I love him like you do.
I'm trying to protect him.

837
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:46,960
- He wanted to die because he's gay.
- No, because we rejected him!

838
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:51,000
Because we made him feel
like he's a freak, unclean.

839
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:54,360
I feel so guilty.
If not for Nathan and his dad...

840
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:55,920
No, wait...

841
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:57,840
Is this that cop's doing?

842
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:01,280
It's up to us to change, not him.
Understand?

843
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:05,840
What are you on about?

844
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:12,880
- I no longer recognize you.
- Corinne...

845
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:16,720
I'm taking the boys
and moving in with my parents.

846
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:19,160
Let's be quite clear about this.

847
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:23,400
If you try to stop me,
I'll report you for child abuse.

848
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:26,800
Think of your patients
and your reputation.

849
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:43,400
- What's going on?
- Nothing. Come on, let's go.

850
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:18,880
- What's your new school like?
- I don't start till tomorrow.

851
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:22,120
I read your email.
It was like a novel!

852
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:25,040
I had to,
you weren't answering the phone.

853
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:28,760
- You hurt me, you know.
- Yes, I know.

854
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,040
I'll come
for the boxing tournament.

855
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:32,640
Great.

856
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:35,200
- Will you be there?
- I don't know.

857
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:41,120
- So you think I'm beautiful?
- Very.

858
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:42,960
A shame I'm not bi.

859
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:44,800
Idiot!

860
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:48,320
Are you there?

861
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:52,480
I have to go now.
But call me again, OK?

862
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:54,120
There's something else...

863
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:06,840
- I talked to Corinne earlier.
- And?

864
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:08,800
They're coming this weekend.

865
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:10,200
Yeah, I know.

866
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:12,240
Hang on... Stop.

867
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:13,960
Just a second.

868
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:17,000
Such a shame having a dad
in poor physical shape!

869
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:19,320
- Poor shape?
- Yeah.

870
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:21,120
Race you to the car!

871
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:34,120
What's on your mind?

872
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:37,720
Maybe I shouldn't have come.

873
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:42,080
Are you mad at me?

874
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:49,560
Not a great question, maybe.

875
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:54,960
You know...

876
01:18:55,960 --> 01:18:59,200
I didn't have anything against you.
I mean...

877
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:03,200
I didn't mean to hurt you.

878
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:09,360
I don't really know what to say.

879
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:16,240
I'm not mad at you.

880
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:22,760
Feels weird, doesn't it?

881
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:28,960
Do you love him?

882
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:36,840
He wasn't for me.

883
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:41,640
Here it comes.

884
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:14,640
I missed you.

885
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,240
I can't get used to that.

886
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:23,640
I can! I think they're lovely.

887
01:20:36,520 --> 01:20:37,760
What's going on?

888
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:41,320
- Where is he?
- Coming.

889
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:42,720
We're waiting.

890
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:44,200
It's OK.

891
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:50,880
- Isn't he with you?
- He doesn't want to fight any more.

892
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:57,560
What's the problem?

893
01:20:58,640 --> 01:21:00,560
I don't want to box any more.

894
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:03,440
I thought I could overcome it.

895
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:04,720
But no.

896
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:08,800
What's the real reason?

897
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:13,920
It shouldn't be you, here.

898
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:23,680
Who are you boxing for,
your dad or yourself?

899
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:27,520
If you don't want to,
no one'll hold it against you.

900
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:31,680
But no regrets.

901
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:33,440
OK?

902
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:36,080
Think about it.
They're all waiting.

903
01:21:45,240 --> 01:21:47,320
Can you help me put my gloves on?

904
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:52,160
Forget everything else now.

905
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:55,200
Take a deep breath,
focus on your fight...

906
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:57,880
There... OK?

907
01:21:57,960 --> 01:21:59,160
Come on.

908
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:10,200
No head butting.

909
01:22:10,280 --> 01:22:11,680
Have a good fight.

910
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:58,160
Raise your guard, Louis!

911
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:12,640
End of the first round.

912
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:21,720
What did I tell you? Look at me!

913
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:23,680
Keep your guard up.

914
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:27,280
Are you listening? Your guard!

915
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:37,920
Get him, Louis!

916
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:48,680
- Go, Louis!
- That's it, Louis, go for it!

917
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:51,200
Go, Louis!

918
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:22,400
Brave lad!

919
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:26,240
The winner is Louis,
by a technical knockout.

920
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:53,280
Did you see my guard?

921
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:57,920
I've improved, haven't I?

922
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:02,440
It's thanks to you.

923
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:09,320
Come and celebrate with us.

924
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,640
Stay, Dad.

925
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:31,360
Aren't you proud of me?

926
01:25:44,240 --> 01:25:46,680
Aren't you proud of me?

927
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:21,240
He needs a bit more time.

928
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:24,640
Come on,
everyone's waiting for you.
