1
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:01,790
Good afternoon and welcome to the
Phase II press conference of the

2
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:05,624
upcoming mission of the
Global Precipitation Measurement.

3
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:09,915
To discuss the mission, we
have with us John Stockton,

4
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:15,207
GPM Project Formulation
Manager from NASA Headquarters;

5
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:17,165
Mohan Bhargav,

6
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:21,040
Project Manager and Spacecraft
Mission Director from Goddard.

7
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,999
Over to you, John.
- Thank you, George.

8
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:27,999
The Office of Management and Budget
released the President's 2004

9
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:33,415
fiscal year budget plan in early February,
flagging off the GPM launch.

10
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:38,124
We have in the Formulation phase
of GPM taken steps to reduce risks

11
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:41,457
to ensure a mission confirmation review.

12
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:46,124
And that's where Mohan Bhargava,
our Project Manager, comes in.

13
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:50,249
Thank you, John.
Good afternoon, everybody.

14
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:55,332
Before I get into Phase II, a quick
update on the recently concluded Phase I.

15
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:59,499
In the Phase I, we focused on
the Definition of Mission Scope,

16
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:03,124
Systematic Measurement Approach,
and Technology Roadmaps.

17
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,900
Will you roll the tape, please?
Thank you.

18
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:11,499
The core satellite is designed
like a TRMM spacecraft,

19
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:17,415
and it'll be launched in a non-sun-sync
orbit at an inclination of 65 degrees

20
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:20,457
and an altitude of 400 kilometers.

21
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:24,915
The constellation satellites would be
pre-existing operational, experimental, and

22
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:29,749
dedicated satellites, with PMW radiometers.

23
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,082
They would operate both in
non-sun-sync and sync orbits

24
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:37,499
at an altitude of 600 to 900 kilometers.

25
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,374
You are welcome to
throw any questions.

26
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:55,749
What are the objectives of the Global
Precipitation Measurement program?

27
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,624
Last question.
- Is this budget justified?

28
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,790
Globally, there is a danger of
water recession in the near future.

29
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:12,499
It will not be unreal to imagine that
in the 21st century, cities like...

30
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:20,915
Beijing, Amman, New Delhi, Santiago,
Jakarta, Mexico City, Lima...

31
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:27,374
and many others, will drink up, use up,
their surrounding waters and perish.

32
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:34,957
Water is going to be rare. Is it not a
reason enough to justify any budget?

33
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,332
Are there any more questions?

34
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,665
Thank you for being here.
- Thank you very much.

35
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,290
I've never seen John Stockton smile so much.

36
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:01,915
He is really happy with us.

37
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:06,499
The press conference went off well.
And your presentation - excellent!

38
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,957
This is really a quantum leap for us.

39
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:15,290
Well, we can now let our hair down.
Now that Phase I is finally over.

40
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,999
Hey, you're very quiet.
What's the matter?

41
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:34,624
I'd like a cup of coffee.
Do you want some?

42
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,415
Yeah. Make me a strong one.
- Sure.

43
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,624
Two new messages.

44
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:47,749
Hi Mohan, this is Paul. I tried
calling you at work and your cell.

45
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:49,915
You seem to be in a meeting.
Call me back.

46
00:05:57,083 --> 00:06:00,832
Good afternoon, Mr. Bhargava.
This is Stephen Carter from the BCIS.

47
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:06,957
Your request for citizenship has been accepted. 
Congratulations. Please call me in my office on Monday. Bye.

48
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:19,290
Congratulations! Your request for
American citizenship has been accepted.

49
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:26,624
You seem lost.
- Not really.

50
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:32,540
I get it. 
Work pressures are stressing you out,

51
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:36,540
and you have no other interests...
No pubbing, no partying.

52
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:41,415
Take my advice - you should get married.

53
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:46,540
You need a life partner.

54
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:50,624
As they say, happiness
doubles when it's shared.

55
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:51,915
Look at me!

56
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:55,415
That's not it, Vinod.

57
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,415
Then what is it?

58
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:05,832
What's the matter?

59
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,624
Today is the anniversary of my parents' deaths.

60
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:12,915
Oh. I'm sorry.

61
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:16,707
It's okay.

62
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:25,165
I still remember it clearly. I was in my
last year at the University of Pennsylvania

63
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,624
when I heard about the car accident.

64
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:34,207
Now I understand why
you've been so down all day.

65
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,249
You know, Vinod...

66
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:42,540
There's something else which has been

67
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,332
bothering my conscience for a while.

68
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:52,207
Do you remember Kaveriamma?

69
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:57,374
Kaveriamma? Your old nanny, right?

70
00:07:57,583 --> 00:08:01,707
Please don't call her a nanny.
She was like a mother to me.

71
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:07,582
I'm sorry. I had no idea.
What about her?

72
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,124
As you know, I was an only child.

73
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:20,999
My parents brought me up with a lot of
love - they provided me with everything.

74
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:27,999
But along with them, Kaveriamma
had a special place in my life.

75
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,832
My mom would make my breakfast,

76
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,665
then Kaveriamma would feed me.

77
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:41,540
While my mom tucked me into bed,
Kaveriamma would sing a lullaby.

78
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:49,290
From the age of two to seventeen,
she looked after me completely.

79
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:57,374
One could call her a second mother,
Kaveriamma was that dear to me.

80
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:04,249
So... when was the last time you met her?

81
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:11,999
At my parents' funeral.

82
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,374
I cried like a baby in Kaveriamma's arms.

83
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:21,415
It was a very tough time for me.

84
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:26,290
Then I came back here and
began to find my footing in life.

85
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:31,207
Kaveriamma wrote letters to me 
often, and I would send her replies.

86
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:40,374
But later on, I became so immersed
in my work that I just lost touch.

87
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:46,165
All this is so out of the blue, Mohan.

88
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:49,915
Why did you suddenly think of her today?

89
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:51,624
It's not sudden, Vinod.

90
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:56,665
I've been thinking about 
Kaveriamma for months.

91
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:00,915
I've been having recurring nightmares of her...

92
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:05,582
...being old, feeble, and helpless.

93
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:10,749
I've made a mistake, Vinod.

94
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,457
I feel so guilty now, having 
forgotten and neglected her...

95
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:21,249
Not cared about her.

96
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,749
I had become selfish, Vinod.

97
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:33,207
She is the only thread capable of
piecing together the memory of my parents.

98
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:48,915
I was thinking of going to Delhi...
and bringing her here.

99
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:52,749
Absolutely! Brilliant idea.

100
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:55,832
But I don't think John will agree.

101
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,332
There's no better time for you
to ask for a vacation than now.

102
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:05,665
We are 28 weeks away from
the GPM launch. John won't refuse.

103
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:11,207
You think so?
- Yeah. Sure.

104
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:15,332
Promise to bring him back
an elephant or something.

105
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:18,915
Yeah. Sure.

106
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,290
Thank you very much.

107
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:41,124
So, it's of the utmost importance
to get the time pressure on the

108
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,832
stabilization unit.

109
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:45,332
Thank you very much, gentlemen.

110
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,582
Excuse me, John.
- Sure, tell me.

111
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:55,207
I have a request for two weeks off.
Need to go to India - is it possible?

112
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:58,165
Is everything okay back home?

113
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:00,999
Oh yeah, everything is all right.
Just a pending matter.

114
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,332
When do you have to leave?

115
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,499
Actually, as soon as possible.

116
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,915
28 weeks to launch?

117
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:11,207
You realize you'll have to
delegate some of this to others.

118
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:14,290
Oh, yes, yes. I'll have a detailed
meeting with the team and

119
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,415
I'll be in constant touch
with Vinod from there.

120
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:20,749
All right, then. Have a good trip.

121
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,040
Thank you very much, John.

122
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:29,290
Amazing. John agreed very quickly.
I should've asked for a vacation myself.

123
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,790
Thank God you didn't. If you had,
mine would've been canceled as well.

124
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:26,900
May I clear your tray, please?
- Yes, thank you.

125
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:30,624
Can I get you anything else?
- No, thank you.

126
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:05,457
This is your captain here.
Good morning, everyone.

127
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,082
We have now started our descent,

128
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:10,749
and in a short time we'll be landing

129
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:13,540
at the Indira Gandhi
International Airport in Delhi.

130
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:20,874
I hope you had a comfortable flight.
Thank you for flying Air India.

131
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:08,332
Your attention, please.

132
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:13,165
Announcing the arrival of
flight AI-112 from New York.

133
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,499
Good to see you.
-Good to see you, too.

134
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:22,915
How was the flight?
- Connecting flight was delayed. Otherwise, first class.

135
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:26,415
Did you get anything for me?
- Yeah, everything's for you, kid.

136
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:32,915
So, Kaveriamma... is she still
living in an old folks' home?

137
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,624
Did you speak with her?

138
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:39,290
No, I want to surprise her.

139
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:43,124
She'll be so glad to see you.
I'm sure she'll have forgotten me.

140
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:44,374
Obviously!

141
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:12,582
Excuse me.
- What is it? May I help you?

142
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:15,207
I've come to see Kaveriamma.

143
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,290
Kaveriamma?
- Yes.

144
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,665
Oh yes, Kaveri! 
She doesn't live with us anymore.

145
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:27,165
Doesn't live here?
- Yes. She stayed with us for about a year...

146
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:30,874
...until a lady came, looking for her.
Kaveri left with her.

147
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,040
But where did she go?

148
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:38,290
One minute.
I'll have to check the register.

149
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:50,874
Bharati ji, this gentleman
is looking for Kaveri.

150
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:53,332
Do you know where she is now?

151
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:56,540
Bharati used to share
a room with Kaveri.

152
00:16:56,875 --> 00:17:00,332
I remember her mentioning
a village before leaving.

153
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:03,915
Now, what was it?

154
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:06,999
Charanpur.
- Yeah, Charanpur.

155
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:13,124
Where is this Charanpur?
- Never heard of it.

156
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,624
We'll find out.

157
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,790
Kaveri was a good woman.

158
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:22,165
We all miss her.

159
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:24,832
Here's the address.

160
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:27,124
Thank you.

161
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,249
Kaveri is very fortunate.

162
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:38,124
There was someone who came
for her then, and now once again.

163
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:42,124
Otherwise, who cares
about old people like us?

164
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:46,749
Come on.

165
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:56,124
Excuse me.

166
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:59,707
Here's the map.
You'll find Charanpur in here.

167
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:02,249
That'll be 150 rupees.
- No, buddy. You don't need to pay me.

168
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,957
Do me a favor. Watch the counter
for me while I nip to the bank.

169
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:11,207
Get me a loan, too.
- No way. You'll manage the counter, right?

170
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:13,082
I'll just sit behind.

171
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:15,415
That's good.
- Come back soon.

172
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:27,624
Excuse me - you've no respect?

173
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:29,290
What's wrong?

174
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:33,832
You can see I am picking up books,
and still you're walking all over them.

175
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,749
I didn't mean to do anything.

176
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:39,374
Sir, books are a source
of knowledge and culture.

177
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:42,290
If you don't know how to
appreciate them, then why are you here?

178
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:47,332
Well... I'm sorry.
- Thanks.

179
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:24,332
I'm sorry, I was looking at this map.

180
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,290
Do you want to buy these books?

181
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:32,499
No. I want to sell them.

182
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,999
Oh! Stupid question. I'm sorry.
- No, I'm sorry.

183
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:41,665
I'm just a little irritated.
- No, I saw what happened.

184
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:43,540
You handled it well.

185
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:46,500
Some people simply don't
have any manners. Really stupid.

186
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:52,957
Oh, yeah... I'll do this for you.
Lots of books.

187
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:58,165
I will need a...
- There.

188
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,415
Of course. Thank you.

189
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,290
That's 13 books of mathematics into 17...

190
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:13,499
...is equal to 221... plus 22
language books into 12...

191
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:21,082
485.

192
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:29,665
8 geography books into
19 is 152... and 485 is...

193
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:30,957
637.

194
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:38,415
Yeah? 637?
Thanks.

195
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:47,624
And these 8 notebooks into 113.
And the total is...

196
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:49,165
750.

197
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:50,999
Must be right.

198
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:58,665
750.
Your math is pretty good!

199
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:06,415
Actually, I should be
giving you a concession.

200
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:08,499
You selected the books,
you did the totaling.

201
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:10,915
You should be in my chair!

202
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:12,374
Then, give me a concession?

203
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:15,165
I can't.

204
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:20,165
My name is actually Mohan Bhargav.
I'm Rahul's friend.

205
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:25,082
He's the owner of this shop - 
he had to go to the bank.

206
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:28,957
He needed some money... he'd ran out.

207
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:30,624
I'm just filling in for him.

208
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:32,540
Oh.

209
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:36,082
I'll pack this for you.
But I need...

210
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:37,249
Bags.

211
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:44,624
I've been looking for
Charanpur on this map.

212
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,040
It's a small village.

213
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:49,707
Do you know where Charanpur can be found?

214
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,374
Yeah, I do know where it is.

215
00:21:56,625 --> 00:22:01,540
Go down National Highway No. 6 for
110 kilometers until you reach Charoti.

216
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:04,290
From there, take a left.

217
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,790
And then keep going for 
80 kilometers, until you reach Azamgarh.

218
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:13,249
After 20 kilometers on a dirt
track, you'll reach Charanpur.

219
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:19,499
Wow! Your geography seems pretty good as well!

220
00:22:23,916 --> 00:22:24,749
Here you...

221
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:28,915
Hello! Excuse me.

222
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,249
Please look after the counter. Hello!

223
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:50,124
What happened?
Are you sick of the job already?

224
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:55,040
No - a girl came in, bought a lot 
of books... but forgot her change.

225
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,540
Hey! Not bad!

226
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,165
You made a profit for the company on
the very first day. You've got the job!

227
00:23:00,708 --> 00:23:02,124
She was amazing!

228
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:04,749
She even told me the way to Charanpur.

229
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:07,374
Great. Where is Charapur?

230
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:09,082
About 200 kilometers from here.

231
00:23:09,491 --> 00:23:13,499
Spare me, Mohan. Don't expect me to
leave the store and drive you there.

232
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:17,874
No worries, man! I'll need a car though.

233
00:23:18,041 --> 00:23:22,665
Take my car!
- No, no. I meant.. could I get a caravan?

234
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:24,790
Caravan? Caravan - why?

235
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:28,540
I don't know what conditions 
I'll have to face in the village.

236
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:31,874
Okay, okay, Mr. NRI.
(Non-Resident Indian)

237
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:35,207
You'll have your caravan. Don't worry.

238
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:28,874
Can you tell me which of
these paths leads to Charanpur?

239
00:24:29,291 --> 00:24:30,915
You have strayed from the path.

240
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:35,665
Strayed? No, no...
I've been following directions.

241
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:39,082
Maybe I took a wrong turn somewhere.

242
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:41,332
It was your destiny to take that wrong turn.

243
00:24:42,666 --> 00:24:44,915
Charanpur is pretty far from here.

244
00:24:45,333 --> 00:24:50,707
I'm headed in that direction.
If you want, I can show you the right way.

245
00:25:44,166 --> 00:25:48,374
Keep going, traveler!

246
00:25:48,625 --> 00:25:52,665
How beautiful is this world?

247
00:25:53,208 --> 00:25:57,332
Forget every burden,
let the flowers pull you in

248
00:25:57,583 --> 00:26:01,540
How vibrant this world is!

249
00:26:20,666 --> 00:26:23,124
Wow!

250
00:26:26,125 --> 00:26:27,540
Encore!

251
00:26:28,916 --> 00:26:29,749
Sing.

252
00:26:31,458 --> 00:26:35,415
These roads call out to me:

253
00:26:35,916 --> 00:26:40,165
Somewhere, someone's waiting for you!

254
00:26:40,375 --> 00:26:44,874
These roads call out to me:

255
00:26:45,041 --> 00:26:49,415
Somewhere, someone's waiting for you!

256
00:26:56,291 --> 00:27:00,540
Why does the heart anxiously beat?
Who is it about to meet?

257
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:05,082
Perhaps what it most desires is about to happen

258
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:09,540
Keep going, traveler!

259
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:13,624
Life's a car; time's the wheel

260
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:18,874
There's a flood of tears and a garden of joys

261
00:27:19,041 --> 00:27:22,624
All wait along this path for you, brother!

262
00:27:23,291 --> 00:27:27,624
Keep going, traveler!

263
00:27:27,833 --> 00:27:31,749
How beautiful is this world?

264
00:27:32,375 --> 00:27:36,749
Forget every burden,
let the flowers pull you in

265
00:27:36,916 --> 00:27:41,207
How vibrant this world is!

266
00:27:59,625 --> 00:28:03,665
Wherever I look along these paths,

267
00:28:04,125 --> 00:28:07,874
colors stream in my glance

268
00:28:08,875 --> 00:28:12,957
The breeze is cool, the shade cool, too

269
00:28:13,166 --> 00:28:17,790
Far, over there, I wonder whose hamlet stands

270
00:28:19,916 --> 00:28:24,082
What cloud has spread over me?
Where has the heart brought me?

271
00:28:24,291 --> 00:28:28,249
What dreams has it shown me?

272
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:32,665
Every dream comes true if the fires of love are lit,

273
00:28:32,875 --> 00:28:37,249
if the path you travel is of your heart!

274
00:28:37,458 --> 00:28:41,749
You will pick pearls from every oyster of time

275
00:28:41,916 --> 00:28:46,374
but only if you always listen to your heart!

276
00:28:46,625 --> 00:28:50,999
Keep going, traveler!

277
00:28:51,208 --> 00:28:55,040
How beautiful is this world?

278
00:28:55,750 --> 00:29:00,040
Forget every burden,
let the flowers pull you in

279
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:04,540
How vibrant this world is!

280
00:29:31,958 --> 00:29:35,874
The heart experiences such ease

281
00:29:36,458 --> 00:29:40,582
As though a load has been
lifted from the shoulders

282
00:29:41,125 --> 00:29:45,332
As though the innocence
of childhood has returned

283
00:29:45,583 --> 00:30:03,415
As though, at long last, one
has bathed in the river Ganga

284
00:30:03,666 --> 00:30:07,915
The heart is pure,
bonds are now strengthened

285
00:30:08,083 --> 00:30:11,915
Life feels fresh and new

286
00:30:12,125 --> 00:30:16,332
There's love in my living,
a song upon my lips

287
00:30:16,541 --> 00:30:20,915
This is your victory, oh traveler!

288
00:30:21,125 --> 00:30:25,332
Wherever you go, may you always find love

289
00:30:25,541 --> 00:30:30,124
and leave a blazing trail, oh traveler!

290
00:30:30,333 --> 00:30:34,915
Keep going, traveler!

291
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:38,832
Who calls out to me?

292
00:30:39,583 --> 00:30:43,957
The river, the mountains,
the lakes and streams, the woods and valleys

293
00:30:44,166 --> 00:30:48,290
Whose beckoning hand do I see there?

294
00:31:06,166 --> 00:31:11,040
Keep going, traveler!

295
00:31:13,291 --> 00:31:18,124
How beautiful is this world?

296
00:32:02,958 --> 00:32:03,874
Excuse me.

297
00:32:04,833 --> 00:32:07,124
Do you know where Kaveri ji lives?

298
00:32:07,916 --> 00:32:10,624
Hey, Chikku!
Take this man to Kaveri ji.

299
00:32:30,916 --> 00:32:33,540
Sorry.
- Watch it!

300
00:32:54,916 --> 00:32:58,040
Amma!

301
00:32:59,083 --> 00:33:04,040
Amma!

302
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:06,790
Wait a while.

303
00:33:06,958 --> 00:33:11,915
She needs to be massaged like this
in the morning and evening, Maithili!

304
00:33:12,083 --> 00:33:14,207
She'll cry a little, but ignore it.

305
00:33:14,416 --> 00:33:16,749
Understood?
Now talk.

306
00:33:16,916 --> 00:33:20,290
Amma, someone has come
to meet you in a very big car.

307
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,749
A very big car?

308
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:24,957
Come on, now! It's parked outside.

309
00:33:25,166 --> 00:33:26,040
I am coming.

310
00:33:30,833 --> 00:33:32,665
Chikku, I hope this isn't one of your pranks!

311
00:33:32,875 --> 00:33:33,665
Look at that.

312
00:33:37,958 --> 00:33:38,999
It's big, isn't it?

313
00:33:46,708 --> 00:33:48,040
What's going on?

314
00:33:49,375 --> 00:33:51,540
Who is this?

315
00:33:52,541 --> 00:33:54,124
Go on... take a guess.

316
00:33:54,583 --> 00:33:58,999
No. No, I can't. Who are you?
Come on, let go! Let go!

317
00:33:59,208 --> 00:34:01,874
Atkan batkan dahi chatokan,
(Krishna's childhood couplet)

318
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,624
Tu Yashoda, main hoon?
(Krishna's childhood couplet)

319
00:34:07,125 --> 00:34:08,124
Mohan!

320
00:34:12,041 --> 00:34:12,749
Mohan!

321
00:34:13,625 --> 00:34:14,665
Kaveriamma.

322
00:34:15,875 --> 00:34:19,832
Mohan... my Mohan!

323
00:34:27,916 --> 00:34:28,999
I can't believe my eyes!

324
00:34:31,458 --> 00:34:34,915
Do you know who this is?
This is my Mohan.

325
00:34:35,583 --> 00:34:37,749
The one I keep telling you about.

326
00:34:38,541 --> 00:34:39,207
Come.

327
00:34:42,291 --> 00:34:46,624
Stop! Wait right here.
Don't step a foot inside. I'll be back.

328
00:35:33,916 --> 00:35:35,415
Now you can come in.

329
00:35:38,916 --> 00:35:40,540
Kaveriamma.
- Yes?

330
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,207
What are you doing?

331
00:35:56,541 --> 00:36:03,915
I can't tell you how
happy I am to see you.

332
00:36:15,208 --> 00:36:21,582
Wait until Gita comes home.
I'll announce that I've won the bet.

333
00:36:22,458 --> 00:36:24,832
Bet? What bet?

334
00:36:26,291 --> 00:36:31,790
Gita always said,
"Your Mohan has forgotten you."

335
00:36:31,958 --> 00:36:32,749
Really?

336
00:36:32,916 --> 00:36:37,540
But I would always retort,
"No, he will come to see me."

337
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:40,415
So we made a bet.

338
00:36:40,916 --> 00:36:44,749
If you did come, she'd have 
to treat me to an ice cream!

339
00:36:44,916 --> 00:36:47,165
Ice cream? Kaveriamma.

340
00:36:47,416 --> 00:36:49,790
Why...?
- Because you haven't changed a bit!

341
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:51,957
You haven't lost your
appetite for ice cream.

342
00:36:52,166 --> 00:36:53,082
Why not?

343
00:36:53,291 --> 00:36:57,082
Is ice cream meant only for kids?
Can't us old-timers enjoy it?

344
00:36:57,291 --> 00:36:58,249
Sit!

345
00:36:58,458 --> 00:37:04,207
All right, you win. 
And by the way, who says you're old?

346
00:37:08,041 --> 00:37:11,999
So... who is this Gita?

347
00:37:12,333 --> 00:37:15,790
Don't you remember?
You often played with her as a child.

348
00:37:15,958 --> 00:37:19,332
She used to visit our
Delhi house with her mother.

349
00:37:19,583 --> 00:37:20,957
Gita...

350
00:37:21,583 --> 00:37:25,290
Are you referring to that
'Gitli' by any chance?

351
00:37:26,208 --> 00:37:29,415
Yes! You called her that.

352
00:37:29,666 --> 00:37:32,624
And this is Nandan, Gita's younger brother.

353
00:37:32,958 --> 00:37:37,957
We lovingly call him 'Chikku.'
- Chikku! Hey, Chikku!

354
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:43,832
He faked a tummy ache today
so that he could miss school.

355
00:37:55,291 --> 00:37:56,874
How old are you?
- Eight.

356
00:37:57,166 --> 00:37:58,249
Which school do you go to?

357
00:37:58,458 --> 00:38:00,332
I study at Navjeevan Paathshala.

358
00:38:00,541 --> 00:38:04,665
My roll number is 6 and
I am in the fourth standard.

359
00:38:04,875 --> 00:38:06,207
The motto of our school is:

360
00:38:06,416 --> 00:38:09,207
"Books are a source of knowledge,
and knowledge is strength."

361
00:38:10,291 --> 00:38:12,332
Your school seems to be a good one.

362
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:15,915
So, why haven't you gone today?
- I had a stomach ache.

363
00:38:16,083 --> 00:38:16,915
Really?

364
00:38:18,166 --> 00:38:19,999
Was the pain here?
Or here?

365
00:38:21,708 --> 00:38:24,374
Would you like to see my school?
- No, not now.

366
00:38:24,583 --> 00:38:28,165
I want to talk to Amma.
- No! Let's go to the school right now.

367
00:38:28,375 --> 00:38:30,082
All right, Chikku.

368
00:38:30,291 --> 00:38:34,165
Mohan, why don't you go
visit the school with Chikku?

369
00:38:34,375 --> 00:38:37,124
You can meet Gita as well. 
She teaches there.

370
00:38:37,875 --> 00:38:39,749
But... I thought Chikku
had a stomach ache.

371
00:38:39,916 --> 00:38:43,790
Ache? Oh, yes.
It was there, but it just went away. 

372
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,040
Let's go to my school now!

373
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,874
That's Uncle Postman!

374
00:38:59,916 --> 00:39:01,749
Not just postman!

375
00:39:01,916 --> 00:39:04,165
I'm the plough and the bull, the field
and the seed, the crop and the grains.

376
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:05,749
I am everything here!

377
00:39:05,916 --> 00:39:09,540
I sort the letters, seal them,
and distribute them, as well.

378
00:39:10,041 --> 00:39:13,124
When on my bicycle, I'm the postman;
and in my chair, postmaster.

379
00:39:13,333 --> 00:39:18,165
The name is Nivaaran Dayal Shrivastava.
How can I help you?

380
00:39:19,125 --> 00:39:20,707
Can I call America from here?

381
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:25,540
There is no ISD here, but you can
connect through Mizwa village's line.

382
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:30,915
By the way, there is
no bank, no bond, no registry.

383
00:39:31,666 --> 00:39:34,790
I apologize for the trouble earlier today.

384
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:40,249
That's okay. You live abroad, right?
- Yes.

385
00:39:41,916 --> 00:39:43,957
I too happen to know some English.

386
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:48,415
What can I do for you?

387
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:49,790
Very good!

388
00:39:55,625 --> 00:39:58,124
Mohan bhaiyya! Look - this is my school!

389
00:40:00,208 --> 00:40:01,249
It's very nice, Chikku.

390
00:40:06,375 --> 00:40:07,832
It was in 1942 that...

391
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,374
...the slogans of the 'Quit India Movement'
were first heard in Bombay.

392
00:40:11,833 --> 00:40:16,665
From Bombay to Lahore,
Lahore to Peshawari...

393
00:40:16,958 --> 00:40:21,082
...the Indian revolutionaries and the
British soldiers were locked in conflict.

394
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:25,832
Blows were dealt in succession,
bullets were whizzing and ricocheting.

395
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,207
But through it all, we protested,
not once raising our hands against others.

396
00:40:30,458 --> 00:40:32,332
I was even hit by a bullet in the shoulder.

397
00:40:33,041 --> 00:40:36,207
They arrested us and threw us in jail.

398
00:40:36,541 --> 00:40:39,957
We kept protesting - Inquilab zindabad!
(Long live the revolution)

399
00:40:40,166 --> 00:40:43,290
Dada ji, did you have a beard then?
- I wish I did.

400
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:47,374
Then the bullet would've gotten
stuck in my beard and become lost.

401
00:40:49,875 --> 00:40:54,582
I... am... going!

402
00:40:54,875 --> 00:41:00,374
We both... are... going!

403
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:05,540
We all... are... going!

404
00:41:05,916 --> 00:41:08,499
Well done! Kamala, now you repeat...

405
00:41:10,416 --> 00:41:12,499
I... am... going!

406
00:41:14,875 --> 00:41:16,874
It's you!

407
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:21,207
I must have misunderstood
your directions and gotten lost.

408
00:41:22,041 --> 00:41:25,207
Excuse me. This is a school,
and a class is in progress.

409
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:26,499
I'm sorry.

410
00:41:26,791 --> 00:41:30,582
Mohan bhaiyya, this is Gita didi.
And didi didi, this is Mohan bhaiyya.

411
00:41:30,791 --> 00:41:33,707
He has come from Aamkarica!
- Not Aamkarica, Chikku. America.

412
00:41:33,875 --> 00:41:37,040
Chikku, what are you doing here?
I thought you had a stomach ache!

413
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:40,790
Amma asked me to show
Mohan bhaiyya the school, so I just...

414
00:41:41,083 --> 00:41:43,165
So you are Gita! Remember me?

415
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:45,707
I used to call you 'Gitli' when we were kids.

416
00:41:50,375 --> 00:41:52,957
The children are supposed 
to be studying. Now will you go?

417
00:41:53,458 --> 00:41:54,499
I'm sorry.

418
00:41:59,291 --> 00:42:02,624
Now I understand.
Mathematics, geography...

419
00:42:04,458 --> 00:42:06,582
Oh yeah, by the way...

420
00:42:06,875 --> 00:42:10,790
You forgot your 50 rupees at the bookstore.

421
00:42:13,083 --> 00:42:15,082
Thank you. Now will you go?

422
00:42:15,291 --> 00:42:18,290
Yes. I'm very sorry.

423
00:42:22,166 --> 00:42:25,165
I... am... going!

424
00:42:25,375 --> 00:42:26,249
Very good.

425
00:42:37,083 --> 00:42:38,374
What's this?

426
00:42:38,833 --> 00:42:41,665
Foot massager.
It'll take care of your aching feet.

427
00:42:44,833 --> 00:42:47,082
There's no electricity at the moment.
- Why?

428
00:42:47,333 --> 00:42:51,874
We have power failures quite often.
- Oh? When will it return?

429
00:42:52,041 --> 00:42:55,957
Nothing can be said for sure.
This happens three or four times a week.

430
00:42:58,916 --> 00:42:59,957
Who are they?

431
00:43:00,875 --> 00:43:03,624
Gita's parents, Shanta and Jagmohan ji.

432
00:43:03,833 --> 00:43:06,790
They started the school in Charanpur.

433
00:43:08,125 --> 00:43:12,415
When Chikku was only five,
Jagmohan ji passed away.

434
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:16,874
Gita was studying at a 
college in Delhi at that time.

435
00:43:17,666 --> 00:43:20,624
As soon as she graduated, she came here...

436
00:43:20,833 --> 00:43:24,290
...to help her mother with
the running of the school.

437
00:43:24,791 --> 00:43:27,957
But Shanta's health was on the decline,

438
00:43:29,083 --> 00:43:31,749
and it came to her sending Gita
to the retirement home to find me.

439
00:43:32,541 --> 00:43:37,957
Before dying, Shanta entrusted
me with the care of her children.

440
00:43:57,666 --> 00:43:58,790
Thanks.

441
00:44:00,625 --> 00:44:04,582
It took you a while.
- Yes. I had to correct a few test papers.

442
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:06,999
I thought I might as well finish them here.

443
00:44:08,166 --> 00:44:12,374
Didi, didi - look what
Mohan bhaiyya got for me!

444
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:15,290
Guess what I'm going to
cook for you, Mohan?

445
00:44:15,541 --> 00:44:16,415
Very nice.

446
00:44:16,875 --> 00:44:20,165
Your favorite tadka dal,
aloo ki sabzi and kheer!

447
00:44:20,583 --> 00:44:21,582
Wow!

448
00:44:23,833 --> 00:44:26,832
Gita! Now you will have 
to treat me to an ice cream.

449
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,415
You lost the bet!

450
00:44:35,458 --> 00:44:39,165
Kaveriamma, I've missed your food.

451
00:44:39,416 --> 00:44:41,124
The kheer was especially good.

452
00:44:42,041 --> 00:44:44,332
I knew you would like it.

453
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:45,999
Enough about me.

454
00:44:47,291 --> 00:44:51,707
Now tell us about yourself...
and your work in America.

455
00:44:53,166 --> 00:44:55,790
Everything's fine in America.

456
00:44:56,208 --> 00:44:58,957
I have all the comforts.
I have all that I could ask for.

457
00:45:00,333 --> 00:45:02,290
I'm glad to hear that.

458
00:45:03,041 --> 00:45:05,707
And how is your nasha going?
(nasha - drugs)

459
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:07,790
Nasha?

460
00:45:09,208 --> 00:45:11,749
Yeah. Why? Have you quit?

461
00:45:15,666 --> 00:45:16,582
Nasha?

462
00:45:16,875 --> 00:45:21,415
NASA? NASA...

463
00:45:21,625 --> 00:45:22,707
That's what I meant.

464
00:45:22,875 --> 00:45:26,665
My work at nasha - 
I mean, NASA - is going very well.

465
00:45:29,583 --> 00:45:30,957
You're an astronaut?

466
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,874
No.

467
00:45:36,125 --> 00:45:40,790
I'm a Project Manager for
Global Precipitation Measurement.

468
00:45:42,541 --> 00:45:45,290
Global Precipitation Measurement.

469
00:45:47,166 --> 00:45:47,999
Very good.

470
00:45:48,208 --> 00:45:51,957
Mohan bhaiyya! Look at this.

471
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:56,999
Wow! Very good. You are a great artist.

472
00:45:57,666 --> 00:46:01,582
Chikku, you skipped school today.
You have to catch up with work. Come on.

473
00:46:03,375 --> 00:46:05,582
Good night, Chikku.
- Say good night.

474
00:46:14,833 --> 00:46:16,415
I owe you an apology.

475
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,290
Apology? For what?

476
00:46:21,833 --> 00:46:22,749
I'm sorry...

477
00:46:23,708 --> 00:46:25,832
...that I wasn't there to take care of you.

478
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,040
What are you talking about?

479
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:29,540
Let me talk, Kaveriamma.

480
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,582
I'm sorry... that I wasn't
there to take care of you.

481
00:46:35,625 --> 00:46:39,374
I'm sorry that I was not there
when you needed me the most.

482
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,249
I'm sorry that you had
to go to an old-age home.

483
00:46:47,791 --> 00:46:49,290
Not another word now.

484
00:46:50,416 --> 00:46:51,290
Son...

485
00:46:53,375 --> 00:46:55,582
...these are all matters of destiny.

486
00:46:58,708 --> 00:47:00,207
I have everything...

487
00:47:00,791 --> 00:47:01,790
Everything, but you.

488
00:47:02,791 --> 00:47:04,624
I miss you very much, Kaveriamma.

489
00:47:05,458 --> 00:47:06,540
Will you come with me?

490
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:08,332
Where?

491
00:47:09,041 --> 00:47:12,624
America.

492
00:47:12,833 --> 00:47:15,165
No, I'm fine here.

493
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,957
Just come with me, you'll love it there.

494
00:47:19,333 --> 00:47:23,874
You'll get a lot of rest and peace.
It's a much better life there.

495
00:47:27,458 --> 00:47:29,332
Let me think about this.

496
00:47:33,458 --> 00:47:35,624
Now, come on.

497
00:47:39,208 --> 00:47:40,499
You should go to sleep here.

498
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:42,790
Here?

499
00:47:43,958 --> 00:47:47,499
If you don't mind,
I will sleep in the caravan.

500
00:47:47,708 --> 00:47:49,457
Now what new machine is this?

501
00:47:49,666 --> 00:47:50,832
One that puts you to sleep?

502
00:47:51,875 --> 00:47:52,999
Something like that.

503
00:47:54,166 --> 00:48:02,874
Good night. 
- Good night.

504
00:49:46,833 --> 00:49:47,624
Yes?

505
00:49:49,833 --> 00:49:50,665
Yes?

506
00:49:52,541 --> 00:49:53,749
Sir, I am Mela Ram.

507
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:56,915
Hello. What do you want?

508
00:49:57,458 --> 00:49:59,207
Sir, I have brought you breakfast.

509
00:49:59,416 --> 00:50:01,999
Please try my breakfast.
- Breakfast? Not now.

510
00:50:02,208 --> 00:50:05,332
Sir, please - I made it especially for you.

511
00:50:05,541 --> 00:50:07,999
I am a very good cook.

512
00:50:08,208 --> 00:50:10,499
Got it... I mean, I understand.

513
00:50:22,125 --> 00:50:25,582
You are a good cook! I'm impressed.
- Thank you, sir.

514
00:50:31,375 --> 00:50:33,790
You have come from America, sir?

515
00:50:36,083 --> 00:50:37,582
One question, sir.

516
00:50:38,166 --> 00:50:40,374
In America, are there a lot of highways?

517
00:50:41,083 --> 00:50:44,082
Yes, there are. But they're
called freeways there.

518
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:45,624
Got it!

519
00:50:45,875 --> 00:50:46,874
I mean, I understand.

520
00:50:49,041 --> 00:50:50,499
One more question, sir.

521
00:50:52,875 --> 00:50:53,499
Be comfortable.

522
00:50:54,416 --> 00:50:56,957
Do they have dhabas on these freeways?
(dhaba - an Indian fast food joint)

523
00:50:57,625 --> 00:50:58,624
Dhaba?
- Yes.

524
00:50:59,875 --> 00:51:02,082
Yeah, there are. Why?

525
00:51:03,375 --> 00:51:04,707
What do you think?

526
00:51:04,875 --> 00:51:09,290
Would an Indian dhaba
work on those freeways?

527
00:51:11,708 --> 00:51:13,874
I think it'll work.
- Will it work?

528
00:51:15,375 --> 00:51:21,207
I think, maybe... 
Thanks for the dhaba - I mean, the breakfast.

529
00:51:21,875 --> 00:51:24,249
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to get ready. Please?

530
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:25,290
Why not, sir?

531
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,499
I'll meet you again, sir.

532
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:29,415
Thank you, Thela Ram.

533
00:51:30,083 --> 00:51:32,290
Sir, it's Mela Ram!
- Sorry, Mela Ram.

534
00:51:33,875 --> 00:51:35,082
Sir, last question.

535
00:51:37,208 --> 00:51:39,249
Sir, I'll give you a very good offer, sir.

536
00:51:39,875 --> 00:51:41,707
We'll open a dhaba in partnership.

537
00:51:41,875 --> 00:51:45,249
I will give you 50% - yes, half of all
the money I make, sir, I'll give you!

538
00:51:45,958 --> 00:51:47,832
I have even thought of
a name for this dhaba.

539
00:51:48,875 --> 00:51:49,707
It will be called...

540
00:51:50,208 --> 00:51:53,915
...Mela Ram Dhaba. Okay? 
- Okay.

541
00:51:54,416 --> 00:51:56,999
Happy? 
- Very happy.

542
00:51:57,208 --> 00:51:58,249
It's a deal, sir.

543
00:51:59,708 --> 00:52:03,207
Jai Ram ji ki!
(Lord Ram be praised)

544
00:52:31,625 --> 00:52:33,290
So this is your caravan!

545
00:52:33,708 --> 00:52:36,082
It's not mine. It belongs to a friend of Rahul's.

546
00:52:38,083 --> 00:52:40,207
It's nice! Isn't it, Gita?

547
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:43,582
Chikku was right.

548
00:52:44,208 --> 00:52:46,249
Really, this car is exactly like a house.

549
00:53:08,291 --> 00:53:09,082
There's a kitchen here.

550
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:10,332
A TV.

551
00:53:11,583 --> 00:53:12,415
A bathroom.

552
00:53:14,625 --> 00:53:15,624
A bed, too.

553
00:53:16,875 --> 00:53:21,624
Wow! This car is like a house on wheels!

554
00:53:21,833 --> 00:53:23,707
Absolutely.

555
00:53:23,875 --> 00:53:24,790
It's very comfortable.

556
00:53:25,875 --> 00:53:27,082
Now we should be going.

557
00:53:27,291 --> 00:53:28,499
We don't want to miss the panchayat.
(governance assembly)

558
00:53:29,083 --> 00:53:35,207
Come on. Let's go.
Come on, quickly.

559
00:53:35,875 --> 00:53:38,499
The dstrict council is deliberating
upon all the demands...

560
00:53:38,708 --> 00:53:41,207
...made in the last village panchayat meeting.

561
00:53:41,708 --> 00:53:44,082
The decision will be made soon.

562
00:53:44,708 --> 00:53:49,082
Sadanand ji, please tell us when the
remaining electric wires will be put up.

563
00:53:49,416 --> 00:53:52,082
We plan to start work as soon as possible.

564
00:53:52,291 --> 00:53:56,082
The Gram Panchayat ha...
- Just a moment, Sadanand Bajpei saab.

565
00:53:56,291 --> 00:53:57,249
I've never seen a panchayat before.

566
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:03,874
Whenever you are asked,
all you say is: "We plan to start work."

567
00:54:04,083 --> 00:54:05,290
You are the Block Development Officer.

568
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:10,082
You are well aware that we have been
dealing with this problem for a long time.

569
00:54:11,083 --> 00:54:14,499
75% of the village is constantly
plagued by electricity failures,

570
00:54:14,708 --> 00:54:18,082
and the remaining
one-fourth still lives in darkness.

571
00:54:18,291 --> 00:54:23,374
This is like covering your
back while your front's open.

572
00:54:24,375 --> 00:54:25,707
Then, what's the point
of these electric wires?

573
00:54:25,875 --> 00:54:30,082
Dada ji, the Government Surveyor
has recorded his observations.

574
00:54:30,291 --> 00:54:32,290
It's now just a matter of a few days.

575
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:33,415
A few days?

576
00:54:33,708 --> 00:54:36,290
In a few days, I'll be at heaven's door.

577
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:38,707
Then you can come light a bulb on my shrine.

578
00:54:39,083 --> 00:54:43,624
Dada ji, don't say that -
may you live a long life!

579
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:47,874
If you don't mind, Dada ji, I also
have a complaint against the village.

580
00:54:48,083 --> 00:54:51,874
What's that?
- One hears that Dukhi, Santram and their boys...

581
00:54:52,625 --> 00:54:55,082
...steal electricity from the poles.

582
00:54:55,291 --> 00:54:58,499
It's not us. It's Santram who's the culprit!

583
00:54:58,708 --> 00:55:01,290
Shut your mouth!
When did we steal electricity?

584
00:55:01,708 --> 00:55:03,874
Now I understand why there
was no power last evening.

585
00:55:04,083 --> 00:55:10,082
Calm down everyone!
- All right, all right.

586
00:55:11,291 --> 00:55:16,374
Sadanand ji, this job should be done soon. 
- Yes.

587
00:55:16,625 --> 00:55:19,082
Otherwise, we'll take the
matter to higher authorities.

588
00:55:19,416 --> 00:55:21,499
Sangam, what is the next case?

589
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:26,290
Case number 35 - the school!

590
00:55:30,291 --> 00:55:31,624
Well, Gita ji?

591
00:55:32,916 --> 00:55:36,082
I wish to continue teaching the
children using the existing premises.

592
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:38,082
The new alternate
place you are suggesting...

593
00:55:38,708 --> 00:55:39,999
...is much too small,

594
00:55:40,291 --> 00:55:44,082
and it's also too far. 
Children can't walk that distance every day.

595
00:55:44,291 --> 00:55:46,582
But why do you need such
a big space for the school?

596
00:55:47,041 --> 00:55:49,790
You don't even have enough
children to fill up the classes.

597
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,624
More children will come
to study in the school.

598
00:55:52,083 --> 00:55:54,207
That's what you've been
saying for a year now!

599
00:55:54,625 --> 00:55:56,874
She has been trying.
We've all been trying.

600
00:55:57,083 --> 00:56:01,499
Look, Dada ji, we need the
school space for the panchayat.

601
00:56:01,875 --> 00:56:03,499
And the tehsildars also want to
establish their office in the school.

602
00:56:03,708 --> 00:56:06,957
And the village needs a
spare room for the granary.

603
00:56:07,375 --> 00:56:10,290
It will be the economic center of the village.

604
00:56:10,625 --> 00:56:15,415
And the place we are offering
you is good enough for teaching.

605
00:56:16,291 --> 00:56:17,249
No, it won't be enough.

606
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:19,707
I want to start a few
more classes in the school.

607
00:56:20,416 --> 00:56:23,082
I want to reinstate those children

608
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:25,415
who have left the school
in the past couple of years.

609
00:56:26,875 --> 00:56:30,082
There also are many villagers who
do not send their children to school.

610
00:56:30,291 --> 00:56:33,499
Today, I appeal to all of them to
start sending their children to school.

611
00:56:38,291 --> 00:56:39,624
All right, Gita ji.

612
00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:42,874
If you can manage to enroll more
children in the next three months,

613
00:56:43,416 --> 00:56:44,582
then we'll be ready to reconsider.

614
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:47,499
But if there are no new admissions,

615
00:56:48,083 --> 00:56:52,707
then you must agree to move
from the current premises.

616
00:56:54,208 --> 00:56:57,874
This month's panchayat is adjourned!

617
00:57:07,291 --> 00:57:10,082
Come, Mohan, let me introduce
you to the members of the panch.

618
00:57:17,875 --> 00:57:20,874
This is my Mohan.
He has just come from America.

619
00:57:21,083 --> 00:57:23,874
Mohan... this is the head of
our village - Vishnudutt ji.

620
00:57:24,083 --> 00:57:24,707
Hello.

621
00:57:27,208 --> 00:57:30,082
Namaste.
- My blessings, son.

622
00:57:30,291 --> 00:57:31,165
Munishwar ji.

623
00:57:32,875 --> 00:57:35,249
God bless you, my son.

624
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:37,082
Gungadin ji. 
- Namaste.

625
00:57:37,375 --> 00:57:39,290
Fatimabi...
- May you live long, my son.

626
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:40,207
...and Narayan ji.

627
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:41,874
God bless you, son.

628
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:43,707
May Lord Ram protect you.

629
00:57:44,291 --> 00:57:45,957
What do you do in America?

630
00:57:47,125 --> 00:57:50,332
I work for a company called NASA.

631
00:57:51,166 --> 00:57:52,707
So, what does this
company manufacture?

632
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:56,332
We make satellites.

633
00:57:58,708 --> 00:57:59,707
What's that?

634
00:58:00,291 --> 00:58:01,749
Oh, come on, Fatima...

635
00:58:02,208 --> 00:58:05,165
...you know those things in the sky.

636
00:58:06,291 --> 00:58:10,707
Satellites...
- Let me explain.

637
00:58:12,291 --> 00:58:15,082
Satellites are like
the moon, orbiting earth.

638
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:17,624
They help us to know when,
where and how much it will rain,

639
00:58:17,875 --> 00:58:19,290
and they predict atmospheric changes.

640
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:20,874
They send us information
about all these things.

641
00:58:21,083 --> 00:58:23,290
That's it!
- Isn't this what you had told me?

642
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:31,290
Wow, Kaveri - I'm impressed!
I had no idea you knew so much...

643
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:31,874
...about these things.

644
00:58:32,083 --> 00:58:37,874
All this work that you have described
is done by our Sahdev out here...

645
00:58:38,083 --> 00:58:39,874
...without rotating himself, believe me!

646
00:58:40,083 --> 00:58:42,082
Hey Sahdev, speak to us!

647
00:58:43,625 --> 00:58:45,290
The sky is clear.

648
00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:49,790
There will be no clouds in
evidence for the next two days.

649
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:54,082
Very good! That's precisely what I do.

650
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:11,624
Mohan bhaiyya! Look!
That's the temple!

651
00:59:14,875 --> 00:59:15,624
Beautiful!

652
00:59:18,166 --> 00:59:20,290
Beautiful! What's this?

653
00:59:21,083 --> 00:59:22,957
This is the specialty of our village.

654
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:28,832
These are the footprints
of Lord Ram and Sita.

655
00:59:29,250 --> 00:59:29,749
What?

656
00:59:31,625 --> 00:59:35,332
Ram and Sita's footprints!

657
00:59:39,541 --> 00:59:41,374
Charanpur. Okay.

658
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:47,374
That explains the name of the village - Charanpur. 
(Charan - feet)

659
01:00:22,958 --> 01:00:24,749
How are you?
- I'm all right.

660
01:00:25,291 --> 01:00:28,332
And Kaveriamma? How is she?
- She's fine.

661
01:00:29,541 --> 01:00:31,290
I've been trying your cell phone.

662
01:00:32,375 --> 01:00:34,749
Yeah. There's no phone network coverage here.

663
01:00:36,166 --> 01:00:40,540
Vinod, I'm no longer in Delhi.
I'm in a village called Charanpur.

664
01:00:41,166 --> 01:00:44,957
Oh. Anyway, now what about
the GPM instrument concept

665
01:00:45,166 --> 01:00:47,290
and risk reduction study
that needs to be initialized?

666
01:00:47,541 --> 01:00:49,540S
I'll e-mail you the graphics right away.

667
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:52,540
You do that. But the internet
connection here is weak.

668
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:54,332
I don't think I'll be able to download them.

669
01:00:54,625 --> 01:00:58,332
Why don't you send by Fed-Ex the
CD to Rahul in Delhi? He'll give it to me.

670
01:00:58,958 --> 01:00:59,540
Okay.

671
01:01:00,750 --> 01:01:01,540
Come fast.

672
01:01:01,958 --> 01:01:04,749
One more thing! The week
will pass by very quickly.

673
01:01:04,958 --> 01:01:05,957
All right.

674
01:01:06,541 --> 01:01:08,540
I am going to be here a
little longer than I thought.

675
01:01:09,541 --> 01:01:10,540
Kaveriamma has some work here,

676
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:12,957
so she can't leave right away.

677
01:01:14,041 --> 01:01:14,957
Okay. Fine.

678
01:01:15,166 --> 01:01:16,957
Can I have a word with John
regarding this? Is he there?

679
01:01:17,166 --> 01:01:18,957
Don't worry about that.
I will take care of that.

680
01:01:19,541 --> 01:01:20,957
See you then.
- Bye.

681
01:01:21,625 --> 01:01:22,749
Jai Ram ji ki.

682
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:28,749
Well, well... the village lingo's getting
a hold on you. Jai Ram ji ki! Bye.

683
01:01:28,958 --> 01:01:29,540
One minute.

684
01:01:32,541 --> 01:01:35,374
How much was that?
518 rupees?

685
01:01:36,041 --> 01:01:37,540
518 rupees, sir.

686
01:01:44,166 --> 01:01:45,165
One second, sir.

687
01:01:46,291 --> 01:01:48,540
You just mentioned the word "internet."

688
01:01:49,458 --> 01:01:50,749
I've heard the word "international."

689
01:01:50,958 --> 01:01:55,874
But "internet"? What is that?
I think I've heard it somewhere.

690
01:01:56,166 --> 01:02:00,540
Internet... Internet is a medium
through which we can...

691
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:04,082
...connect and communicate
with people in any part of the world.

692
01:02:04,291 --> 01:02:07,165
No post office needed!
This is called e-mail.

693
01:02:07,750 --> 01:02:12,165
E-mail! Really?
Fantastic!

694
01:02:12,541 --> 01:02:16,749
If this e-mail is somehow
installed in this village,

695
01:02:17,291 --> 01:02:20,540
I'll be in seventh heaven!
- How so?

696
01:02:20,750 --> 01:02:23,540
Because then I wouldn't
have to deliver any little letters.

697
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:28,374
I would just sit here and e-mail them all!

698
01:02:28,958 --> 01:02:33,749
E-mail is indeed the summum bonum,

699
01:02:33,958 --> 01:02:35,540
it breaks the walls that...

700
01:02:35,750 --> 01:02:37,957
...separate home and the world!

701
01:02:39,958 --> 01:02:43,165
Thank you, sir.
- Okay.

702
01:03:01,041 --> 01:03:02,832
Time to get up!

703
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:08,749
Kaveriamma, don't wake me up!
I haven't slept like this in years.

704
01:03:09,541 --> 01:03:12,040
Get up. We have a lot of work to do now.

705
01:03:12,291 --> 01:03:15,957
The guests will be here at eleven.
The house needs to be cleaned.

706
01:03:16,375 --> 01:03:19,874
What's going on? Who are the guests?

707
01:03:20,833 --> 01:03:24,624
A potential groom is coming
to see Gita with his parents.

708
01:03:25,041 --> 01:03:25,957
What?

709
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:28,957
They are from Azamgarh.
- Gita's marriage?

710
01:03:29,166 --> 01:03:30,374
Yes!
- Yes?

711
01:03:31,541 --> 01:03:32,874
Gita's marriage.

712
01:03:33,541 --> 01:03:35,165
I forgot to tell you last night.

713
01:03:35,875 --> 01:03:39,624
About two months ago, Vishwas ji,
the boy's father, wrote to me.

714
01:03:40,291 --> 01:03:42,040
Now, finally, they're coming here today.

715
01:03:42,250 --> 01:03:44,374
But what's the need for all this?
- What do you mean?

716
01:03:44,541 --> 01:03:48,957
I mean... I mean, what's the rush?
She's just a child!

717
01:03:51,166 --> 01:03:55,749
What a strange thing to say!
Come on, get ready.

718
01:03:56,291 --> 01:03:59,165
Why should I get ready?
As if they're coming to see me.

719
01:04:32,666 --> 01:04:35,165
This is Gita.
- Namaste.

720
01:04:35,625 --> 01:04:37,749
This is Raghunath.
- Namaste.

721
01:04:37,958 --> 01:04:38,540
Please sit.

722
01:04:43,666 --> 01:04:44,957
Excuse me, I'll just be back.

723
01:04:53,416 --> 01:04:57,165
I've heard... you run a school here.
- Yes.

724
01:05:08,166 --> 01:05:09,957
We have a chemicals business.

725
01:05:10,541 --> 01:05:11,165
Really?

726
01:05:41,958 --> 01:05:44,040
The demand that you're
making is not acceptable to me.

727
01:05:45,375 --> 01:05:49,040
Teaching at this school is 
my profession and my passion.

728
01:05:49,458 --> 01:05:52,540
And I'd like to continue
this work after marriage.

729
01:05:53,375 --> 01:05:55,749
A woman's hands are full
just with household chores.

730
01:05:56,375 --> 01:06:00,165
I disagree. I'd take care of my
house in addition to my work.

731
01:06:00,375 --> 01:06:03,749
But we don't like the women
of our home to work outside.

732
01:06:04,541 --> 01:06:08,040
Besides, I fail to see why you would
want to keep working after marriage.

733
01:06:08,958 --> 01:06:11,165
What if I say the same to your son?

734
01:06:13,125 --> 01:06:16,165
My parents brought me
up with love and respect.

735
01:06:16,958 --> 01:06:18,457
And they expected me to live my life with...

736
01:06:19,083 --> 01:06:22,874
...self-esteem, independence and self-reliance.

737
01:06:23,541 --> 01:06:29,165
If your son has a desire to be
something in life and to have a part in society,

738
01:06:29,375 --> 01:06:31,540
then why can't women
have the same desire?

739
01:06:32,166 --> 01:06:35,540
Be it in any field, women 
are making their mark equally.

740
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:39,874
There's more to a woman
than just wearing bangles.

741
01:06:41,083 --> 01:06:43,749
And after marriage, aren't the
house and the children as much...

742
01:06:43,958 --> 01:06:46,249
...a responsibility of the man as the woman?

743
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,957
Why can't the husband 
and wife work as a team?

744
01:06:51,291 --> 01:06:53,540
Why should one of them
sacrifice more than the other?

745
01:06:57,541 --> 01:07:01,249
I don't accept the demand that
I must not work after marriage.

746
01:07:02,875 --> 01:07:05,957
You mean... are you rejecting this proposal?

747
01:07:06,625 --> 01:07:08,040
I have nothing else to say.

748
01:07:23,958 --> 01:07:28,332
This is how the new generation thinks.

749
01:07:29,625 --> 01:07:34,165
We should not carry this matter any further.

750
01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:38,290
I'm sorry, Sharda ji... Vishwas ji.

751
01:07:39,666 --> 01:07:40,749
It's all right.

752
01:08:30,541 --> 01:08:34,332
I'm upset with what happened today.
- But I felt I was right.

753
01:08:34,958 --> 01:08:37,749
I don't think you should have
expressed your views in that way.

754
01:08:37,958 --> 01:08:40,165
Whatever they wanted 
was against my principles.

755
01:08:40,458 --> 01:08:42,749
Kaveriamma, Gita is right.

756
01:08:43,541 --> 01:08:44,957
But Mohan, he was a nice boy.

757
01:08:45,166 --> 01:08:48,957
You can change people's views
about life over a period of time.

758
01:08:49,166 --> 01:08:53,749
Yeah, you do have a point there.
- No. I couldn't have changed him.

759
01:08:55,750 --> 01:09:00,957
Habits can be altered over time, but
narrow opinions and beliefs cannot be.

760
01:09:01,541 --> 01:09:02,957
I'm absolutely certain...

761
01:09:03,166 --> 01:09:05,374
...that their next demand
would be the dowry amount.

762
01:09:05,541 --> 01:09:10,040
Quite possible. I completely agree with you.

763
01:09:10,541 --> 01:09:17,040
This thinking is embedded in our culture
and traditions, and it hampers the nation.

764
01:09:17,250 --> 01:09:18,165
Excuse me?

765
01:09:18,375 --> 01:09:23,165
Without culture and traditions, the
country would be left with no soul.

766
01:09:23,875 --> 01:09:26,957
But Mohan, we are not
talking about the country.

767
01:09:27,875 --> 01:09:31,249
I know, Kaveriamma.
But it's all connected, isn't it?

768
01:09:32,041 --> 01:09:35,332
What is this soul you talk of, Gita?
We are plagued with problems.

769
01:09:35,958 --> 01:09:38,540
I mean, you and I both
know that illiteracy is rampant,

770
01:09:39,166 --> 01:09:41,874
that we have administrative problems,

771
01:09:42,083 --> 01:09:44,290
and we are yet underdeveloped.

772
01:09:44,750 --> 01:09:49,082
Yes. Illiteracy and poverty are hand in glove.

773
01:09:49,375 --> 01:09:52,749
Kaveriamma, your village has
not even gotten electricity yet.

774
01:09:53,666 --> 01:09:58,040
Caste discrimination, overpopulation,
unemployment, corruption...

775
01:09:58,375 --> 01:10:02,415
I mean... our state of affairs is dismal.
It's pathetic. Pass me the salt.

776
01:10:03,166 --> 01:10:06,165
You have drifted from our topic. But since
you've brought this up, let me tell you,

777
01:10:06,375 --> 01:10:08,957
the government is trying to
find solutions for these problems.

778
01:10:09,166 --> 01:10:11,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah! We'll see how
much good their solutions bring.

779
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:13,415
The infrastructure that the
government has is not enough to...

780
01:10:13,958 --> 01:10:16,332
...cope with even one fourth
of the existing population.

781
01:10:16,541 --> 01:10:19,540
The government has always failed
to satisfy the needs of the population.

782
01:10:20,125 --> 01:10:22,957
The government is making
policies, making efforts.

783
01:10:23,166 --> 01:10:23,957
What do you mean by "efforts"?

784
01:10:24,166 --> 01:10:28,665
Just to make resolutions and collect funds for them?

785
01:10:28,875 --> 01:10:30,290
Is that where the government's work ends?

786
01:10:31,083 --> 01:10:34,499
Whether this money is implemented in the
first place to reach the grassroot level or not...

787
01:10:34,958 --> 01:10:38,290
...whether the common man
 benefits or not from their resolutions...

788
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:40,165
...are they not responsible
for these things, as well?

789
01:10:40,375 --> 01:10:41,332
Yes, they are.
- Then...?

790
01:10:41,958 --> 01:10:43,749
But what do you think the
government is, after all?

791
01:10:43,958 --> 01:10:47,165
The government is a system, of
which the public is also a part.

792
01:10:47,708 --> 01:10:51,165
Us, you, this village... 
we all are involved in this system.

793
01:10:51,541 --> 01:10:53,540
Now, if the system is lacking
in certain things, then...

794
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:57,374
...to remedy its weaknesses
is our responsibility, as well.

795
01:10:57,541 --> 01:11:01,957
God helps only those who help themselves.

796
01:11:02,166 --> 01:11:05,040
Yes, Kaveriamma, but things
are not going to change here.

797
01:11:05,541 --> 01:11:07,749
Because no one wants to change.

798
01:11:08,583 --> 01:11:12,374
It's easy for you to criticize.
But are you doing anything about it? No.

799
01:11:12,541 --> 01:11:13,165
Excuse me.

800
01:11:13,375 --> 01:11:16,040
At least I am not defending
the government like you.

801
01:11:16,708 --> 01:11:21,332
I'm building satellites to 
help technology advance.

802
01:11:21,541 --> 01:11:22,749
For everyone - mankind!

803
01:11:23,291 --> 01:11:24,874
Some more curry?
- No.

804
01:11:27,208 --> 01:11:28,749
But you are doing it all there.

805
01:11:28,958 --> 01:11:31,540
I'm doing all that I can here,
at the village grassroot level.

806
01:11:31,750 --> 01:11:33,665
I'm trying to make this a better place!

807
01:11:34,291 --> 01:11:36,332
Gita... you are a typical Indian.

808
01:11:36,958 --> 01:11:38,749
You Indians can't take criticism.

809
01:11:39,458 --> 01:11:40,540
You Indians?

810
01:11:43,041 --> 01:11:45,624
Sorry, I mean... we Indians.

811
01:11:47,541 --> 01:11:50,290
Anyway, we are aware that not
much has changed in a long time.

812
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:52,540
But I still want to try to make a difference.

813
01:11:54,541 --> 01:11:56,040
You have given up all hope!

814
01:11:56,625 --> 01:11:57,499
Not at all!

815
01:11:57,875 --> 01:11:59,749
Yes, you have.
- No, I haven't.

816
01:12:01,958 --> 01:12:02,749
She's really a fighter, isn't she?

817
01:12:03,541 --> 01:12:05,082
You're no less one yourself.

818
01:12:06,541 --> 01:12:09,165
Now what is to become of this girl?
He was such a nice boy.

819
01:12:09,375 --> 01:12:11,165
There are other boys.
- Yes, there are.

820
01:12:12,458 --> 01:12:14,415
But it's not easy to please Gita.

821
01:12:15,958 --> 01:12:18,249
She has too many expectations.

822
01:12:19,041 --> 01:12:20,874
To top all this, there's the school case.

823
01:12:21,166 --> 01:12:24,540
And until both of these problems are solved,
you won't be able to leave with me.

824
01:12:25,541 --> 01:12:28,040
I have a plan... let's split up the work.

825
01:12:28,541 --> 01:12:30,165
I'm the boy... I mean...

826
01:12:30,375 --> 01:12:32,749
You find a boy, and I will
find children for the school.

827
01:12:33,291 --> 01:12:35,082
We'll solve Gita's problems.

828
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:38,332
What did you say?

829
01:12:39,750 --> 01:12:40,957
Nothing.

830
01:12:45,041 --> 01:12:46,957
Hail the Lord of Strength!

831
01:12:47,750 --> 01:12:49,749
This is the first lesson in wrestling.

832
01:12:49,958 --> 01:12:51,165
Remember it.

833
01:12:53,375 --> 01:12:56,957
There's no letter for you, Mohan babu.

834
01:12:57,166 --> 01:12:59,749
You're a wrestler as well?

835
01:12:59,958 --> 01:13:02,040
I've been wrestling since I was a child,

836
01:13:02,375 --> 01:13:06,332
and it's my favorite hobby.
- Very good.

837
01:13:10,875 --> 01:13:12,749
Just out of curiosity, until
what grade have you studied?

838
01:13:12,958 --> 01:13:16,249
I mean, you must have worked
very hard to gain this post.

839
01:13:16,541 --> 01:13:17,624
I am a graduate.

840
01:13:18,166 --> 01:13:22,374
How fortunate you are.
- Fortunate... yes.

841
01:13:22,541 --> 01:13:23,749
But I've also studied very
hard to attain this post.

842
01:13:23,958 --> 01:13:25,165
I'm sure you studied hard,

843
01:13:25,375 --> 01:13:27,874
but at least you had the
opportunity to go to high school.

844
01:13:28,875 --> 01:13:31,499
I feel very sorry for the village children.

845
01:13:32,541 --> 01:13:34,165
Why is that?
- I'll explain.

846
01:13:35,958 --> 01:13:39,665
What are your views on the school case?

847
01:13:40,083 --> 01:13:41,749
The school case? It's very simple.

848
01:13:41,958 --> 01:13:44,540
The school must move from here.
That space is needed for the panchayat.

849
01:13:45,291 --> 01:13:47,540
That is why I feel bad for
the children of the village.

850
01:13:48,375 --> 01:13:52,332
Look... the panchayat is not allowing
a high school to be started here.

851
01:13:52,541 --> 01:13:56,040
And what good will it do children
to study only until the 4th standard?

852
01:13:56,375 --> 01:14:01,040
If they want to succeed in life like you,
then they must go to high school!

853
01:14:01,958 --> 01:14:02,540
True.

854
01:14:04,541 --> 01:14:05,290
Look!

855
01:14:06,750 --> 01:14:10,957
It's here the high school will stand.
The children will study here.

856
01:14:11,375 --> 01:14:16,624
Then they can start writing
letters for their parents themselves.

857
01:14:16,958 --> 01:14:20,290
Think about the work it will save you.

858
01:14:21,958 --> 01:14:23,874
I think the school
should not shift from here.

859
01:14:24,541 --> 01:14:26,540
I will talk to people in the village.

860
01:14:26,750 --> 01:14:28,749
You must!
- Definitely.

861
01:14:30,875 --> 01:14:33,040
Praise the Lord of Might.
- Praise the Lord of Might.

862
01:14:34,458 --> 01:14:35,165
Mohan babu...

863
01:14:35,541 --> 01:14:36,165
Yes?

864
01:14:40,750 --> 01:14:43,040
Why don't you drop by our
wrestling ring sometime?

865
01:14:43,541 --> 01:14:45,040
Yeah. Sure, I will!

866
01:14:46,625 --> 01:14:48,374
How about a wrestling session?

867
01:14:51,166 --> 01:14:52,040
Sure!

868
01:14:58,750 --> 01:15:00,540
Mohan babu, I have a surprise for you.

869
01:15:00,875 --> 01:15:03,457
Here... have some pakodas
with shimla mirch tandoori.

870
01:15:03,666 --> 01:15:05,957
Try it, sir. I've made it especially for you.

871
01:15:06,166 --> 01:15:10,374
Is this all you can make?
- No, sir. I can cook whatever you desire.

872
01:15:10,958 --> 01:15:13,165
I understand. Sorry, Mela Ram...

873
01:15:13,375 --> 01:15:14,624
Please don't say a word.

874
01:15:15,041 --> 01:15:17,165
I know what you have on your mind.
- What?

875
01:15:17,875 --> 01:15:20,499
Actually, I was thinking...
you must have felt bad.

876
01:15:20,833 --> 01:15:22,957
I'll give you 60%.

877
01:15:23,291 --> 01:15:25,332
I'll give you 60% in partnership.

878
01:15:25,541 --> 01:15:26,374
Okay.

879
01:15:27,250 --> 01:15:29,040
Your lunch and dinner
will be on the house!

880
01:15:30,750 --> 01:15:32,290
I have changed the name of our dhaba.

881
01:15:33,166 --> 01:15:37,165
We can call it Mohan's Mela Ram Dhaba,

882
01:15:37,541 --> 01:15:39,165
or Mela Ram's Mohan Dhaba.

883
01:15:40,166 --> 01:15:42,040
You decide. Then we'll finalize it.

884
01:15:42,375 --> 01:15:44,540
The first one sounds okay.
Mohan's Mela Ram Dhaba.

885
01:15:45,375 --> 01:15:48,040
Okay then. So, deal done, sir?

886
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:51,624
But before that, you'll have to help me.

887
01:15:51,833 --> 01:15:54,165
Help? How?
- I'd like to send the kids from...

888
01:15:54,375 --> 01:15:57,332
...your community to the school.
To do this, I'll need your help.

889
01:15:57,875 --> 01:15:58,957
Understood.

890
01:16:00,125 --> 01:16:02,749
But it's little difficult.

891
01:16:03,750 --> 01:16:05,290
Well, then your going to America...

892
01:16:06,291 --> 01:16:07,540
...also looks little "difficult."

893
01:16:07,750 --> 01:16:08,749
It is easy, sir.

894
01:16:08,958 --> 01:16:11,249
I'm ready. Just tell me what I need to do.

895
01:16:11,875 --> 01:16:15,332
Our children and their
kids in the same school?

896
01:16:16,541 --> 01:16:20,457
Lions and sheep never drink water
from the same pool, Mohan babu.

897
01:16:27,458 --> 01:16:28,749
So...

898
01:16:29,875 --> 01:16:31,290
...what is your background?

899
01:16:33,666 --> 01:16:34,749
I mean...

900
01:16:35,875 --> 01:16:36,957
...what caste are you?

901
01:16:38,958 --> 01:16:40,957
I'm a Brahmin.

902
01:16:42,541 --> 01:16:44,957
Then learn to behave like one.

903
01:16:45,875 --> 01:16:47,165
So what am I expected to do?

904
01:16:47,750 --> 01:16:51,165
We've heard that you eat
food cooked by Mela Ram.

905
01:16:51,958 --> 01:16:54,165
Are you aware of what caste he is?

906
01:16:55,166 --> 01:16:59,165
What difference does that make?
What age are you living in?

907
01:16:59,541 --> 01:17:01,874
Don't you dare degrade our piety!

908
01:17:02,291 --> 01:17:05,165
You've fallen - are you out to drag us down, too?

909
01:17:05,541 --> 01:17:10,415
And you, Nivaaran ji, it seems as
though you've switched sides already!

910
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:14,040
I am only doing what I think is right.

911
01:17:14,458 --> 01:17:17,415
If you have any objections,
you don't have to accept this.

912
01:17:33,166 --> 01:17:37,165
Hey, Birsa! This is Mohan babu.
He wants to have a word with you.

913
01:17:38,708 --> 01:17:41,540
What has happened, sir?
Have we done anything wrong?

914
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:44,749
No, no.
I just came to ask...

915
01:17:45,458 --> 01:17:47,540
...if you would like to enroll
your children in the school.

916
01:17:50,166 --> 01:17:54,374
Huzoor, those villagers do not
allow us to work in the village.

917
01:17:55,291 --> 01:17:57,749
Do you think they'd agree
to educate our children?

918
01:17:59,458 --> 01:18:03,332
Don't worry.
Your kids will go to school.

919
01:18:04,166 --> 01:18:08,874
But of what use is studying now
that they are of marriageable age?

920
01:18:09,166 --> 01:18:12,749
My daughter Lajwa is going to be engaged.

921
01:18:14,750 --> 01:18:15,749
Child marriage.

922
01:18:19,541 --> 01:18:23,457
Can you not see our situation?
We barely manage to fill our stomachs.

923
01:18:23,958 --> 01:18:25,957
How could their school fees be paid?

924
01:18:26,958 --> 01:18:29,040
Gita ji doesn't run the school for profit.

925
01:18:30,541 --> 01:18:33,957
Teaching is her passion... her life.

926
01:18:35,458 --> 01:18:37,040
If we speak with her,

927
01:18:37,458 --> 01:18:39,499
we can assure you that she will help you.

928
01:18:40,041 --> 01:18:43,540
The village's people don't
want to see us around.

929
01:18:43,750 --> 01:18:45,040
Look...

930
01:18:46,166 --> 01:18:47,374
Let it be, sir.

931
01:18:48,583 --> 01:18:51,415
Education is not in their destiny.

932
01:18:53,750 --> 01:18:54,957
Not in my children's destiny.

933
01:19:02,166 --> 01:19:03,540
What have you decided, Vishno ji?

934
01:19:03,750 --> 01:19:05,540
Studies are not going to
fill an empty stomach, babu!

935
01:19:05,750 --> 01:19:07,749
Since pottery will be their livelihood,

936
01:19:07,958 --> 01:19:09,457
why waste time studying?

937
01:19:10,625 --> 01:19:12,957
Have you made these?
They're very beautiful.

938
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:16,415
Tell me - how much do you sell this pot for?

939
01:19:16,625 --> 01:19:18,499
Thirty rupees.
- What?

940
01:19:18,958 --> 01:19:20,749
We have a contractor in
the city who buys it from us.

941
01:19:20,958 --> 01:19:23,540
Sometimes we even get an
extra five or ten rupees.

942
01:19:23,750 --> 01:19:26,040
We won't sell it for less than thirty, babu ji!

943
01:19:26,875 --> 01:19:28,957
The price of this pot wouldn't be
less than a hundred rupees in the city. 

944
01:19:29,166 --> 01:19:32,374
Maybe if you people were educated,
you wouldn't be fooled like this!

945
01:19:32,541 --> 01:19:37,249
Nivaaran ji. I know that this art has
been passed down through the generations.

946
01:19:37,541 --> 01:19:40,957
I agree that your kids
should carry on this tradition.

947
01:19:41,750 --> 01:19:44,165
But in this day and age, it is
imperative that they be educated.

948
01:19:44,375 --> 01:19:45,749
Is it not, Nivaaran ji?
- Absolutely.

949
01:19:46,541 --> 01:19:50,749
Because education will help them take
this art to its deserving end...

950
01:19:50,958 --> 01:19:53,040
...and earn appropriate prices.

951
01:19:53,833 --> 01:19:57,749
You are selling us a dream!
Don't show us these dreams.

952
01:20:11,833 --> 01:20:13,332
Namaste, Sarpanch ji.

953
01:20:13,875 --> 01:20:16,957
Namaste, Nivaaran ji.
Welcome, Mohan ji.

954
01:20:17,291 --> 01:20:19,000
Mohan babu wanted to
discuss the school with you.

955
01:20:19,001 --> 01:20:23,374
I know, I know.
Bhai, both my grandsons...

956
01:20:23,541 --> 01:20:24,374
...are enrolled in the school.

957
01:20:24,875 --> 01:20:28,749
We have great respect
for education in this house!

958
01:20:29,041 --> 01:20:31,957
But I have heard that you have
two granddaughters as well...

959
01:20:32,166 --> 01:20:34,374
...and that both of them 
have dropped out of school.

960
01:20:34,750 --> 01:20:36,749
Oh, yes - Kusum and Suman.

961
01:20:37,875 --> 01:20:39,957
They have both studied
until the fourth grade.

962
01:20:40,375 --> 01:20:42,749
Now, how much more can they study?

963
01:20:43,291 --> 01:20:45,332
It's time for them to learn household work,

964
01:20:45,541 --> 01:20:47,374
cooking and such things.

965
01:20:47,541 --> 01:20:50,374
After all, that's what will help
them once they get married.

966
01:20:50,541 --> 01:20:51,749
How can you say such things?

967
01:20:52,750 --> 01:20:54,957
Education instills confidence in girls.

968
01:20:55,541 --> 01:20:57,540
Don't you want to see
them study and live their lives...

969
01:20:57,750 --> 01:21:02,540
...with self-respect,
independence, and self-reliance?

970
01:21:03,958 --> 01:21:06,332
There's more to a woman
than just wearing bangles.

971
01:21:06,750 --> 01:21:09,165
Agreed, Mohan ji!

972
01:21:10,166 --> 01:21:12,624
But the village doesn't have a high school...

973
01:21:13,166 --> 01:21:14,749
...that they can attend.

974
01:21:15,541 --> 01:21:18,165
But Mizwa village does.
You could have sent them there.

975
01:21:18,375 --> 01:21:20,165
But now you don't need
to worry about that,

976
01:21:20,541 --> 01:21:23,957
because Gita ji is planning to
open a high school in Charanpur.

977
01:21:24,541 --> 01:21:26,249
If she has your support, that is.

978
01:21:32,375 --> 01:21:33,749
Do support us.

979
01:21:44,541 --> 01:21:46,165
Not possible.

980
01:21:46,375 --> 01:21:49,332
But how much longer are you going to control
the children's lives with caste and community?

981
01:21:49,541 --> 01:21:53,457
Who are you to tell us 
what we should be doing, bhai?

982
01:21:54,458 --> 01:21:57,249
How much do you know about the
ways and problems of this village?

983
01:21:58,291 --> 01:21:59,957
I accept that you were
born in this country,

984
01:22:00,166 --> 01:22:03,374
but that doesn't mean you 
can go around giving sermons.

985
01:22:04,166 --> 01:22:08,749
We understand quite well what we
need to do for the progress of our village.

986
01:22:08,958 --> 01:22:11,249
Yes. But the ones who stand
to lose are the children, right?

987
01:22:11,458 --> 01:22:13,749
Enough arguing! 

988
01:22:13,958 --> 01:22:14,540
Father.

989
01:22:15,166 --> 01:22:19,540
For heaven's sake, stay out
of the village matters. Understand?

990
01:22:19,958 --> 01:22:23,332
Anyway, Mohan babu, 
you are just a visitor here.

991
01:22:23,541 --> 01:22:26,540
Roam around, enjoy the village...
why get involved in all this?

992
01:22:26,750 --> 01:22:30,374
Attention!
A movie is to be screened in Charanpur.

993
01:22:30,541 --> 01:22:33,749
Tonight, the panchayat has 
organized a movie screening in the village.

994
01:22:34,958 --> 01:22:41,374
You must come and watch... you'll enjoy it!

995
01:22:51,375 --> 01:22:55,332
Get down.

996
01:23:05,625 --> 01:23:08,000
Okay, sir. We'll meet later.

997
01:23:08,833 --> 01:23:10,165
Why? Won't you see the movie?

998
01:23:10,541 --> 01:23:11,540
I'll be sitting on this side
and watching the movie.

999
01:23:12,541 --> 01:23:13,165
Okay.

1000
01:23:29,875 --> 01:23:31,290
By the way, which film are they showing?

1001
01:23:31,541 --> 01:23:33,749
Yaadon ki Baaraat. (Union of Memories)
- Whose union?

1002
01:23:34,375 --> 01:23:38,290
Union of Memories.
- Oh. I heard, "our union."

1003
01:23:40,250 --> 01:23:40,957
Shut up.

1004
01:23:41,166 --> 01:23:44,957
Just kidding. Actually, it's one of my favorite films.

1005
01:23:45,166 --> 01:23:47,165
Please turn off your lanterns.
The film is about to begin.

1006
01:23:50,166 --> 01:23:52,540
Dear people, kind patrons, and art lovers!

1007
01:23:52,750 --> 01:23:54,540
Here's an important announcement:

1008
01:23:54,750 --> 01:23:59,749
Parents must keep a watchful eye
on their children during the screening!

1009
01:24:00,291 --> 01:24:03,540
And please don't disturb your neighbor.

1010
01:24:03,875 --> 01:24:09,332
So, presenting the separation
and union of three brothers!

1011
01:24:09,541 --> 01:24:13,165
Todays' movie is...
Yaadon ki Baaraat!

1012
01:24:52,375 --> 01:24:55,957
Will you sing the song you do every year?
- Yes.

1013
01:26:33,041 --> 01:26:34,374
What happened?

1014
01:26:35,166 --> 01:26:36,749
What happened to the movie?

1015
01:26:36,958 --> 01:26:39,415
Not a power failure again!

1016
01:26:40,958 --> 01:26:42,165
Chikku, it's just temporary.

1017
01:26:42,375 --> 01:26:44,040
No, it won't come back! I know it won't.

1018
01:26:44,250 --> 01:26:46,249
How much time will this take?

1019
01:26:46,458 --> 01:26:48,957
It will take twenty minutes
to start the generator.

1020
01:26:49,166 --> 01:26:49,749
Hurry up.

1021
01:26:49,958 --> 01:26:50,957
Now don't cry, children!

1022
01:26:51,166 --> 01:26:52,374
Everyone quiet!

1023
01:26:52,375 --> 01:26:54,165
Sit down.

1024
01:26:58,541 --> 01:27:04,540
All the children on the other side, quiet!

1025
01:27:04,750 --> 01:27:07,332
Don't cry. Now, listen to me carefully.

1026
01:27:07,750 --> 01:27:16,749
Everybody, now look up at the
sky and tell me what you see.

1027
01:27:20,750 --> 01:27:22,332
The stars!

1028
01:27:24,750 --> 01:27:30,457
Now, tell me... can you see
the stars forming a plough?

1029
01:27:33,375 --> 01:27:34,957
Plough?

1030
01:27:36,750 --> 01:27:39,957
Yes, a plough.
Do you see it?

1031
01:27:43,541 --> 01:27:45,957
No.
- I'll help you.

1032
01:27:47,958 --> 01:27:49,040
There...

1033
01:27:49,291 --> 01:27:52,624
Can you see the brightest star in the sky?

1034
01:27:53,875 --> 01:27:55,499
Can you see it?
- Yes.

1035
01:27:56,041 --> 01:27:59,749
Along that star on the right
are three stars in a line.

1036
01:27:59,958 --> 01:28:01,290
Yes.

1037
01:28:04,166 --> 01:28:06,165
Can you see them?
- Yes.

1038
01:28:06,541 --> 01:28:12,749
Now below the third star,
five stars form a curve to the left.

1039
01:28:19,750 --> 01:28:22,540
Can you see them?
- Yes.

1040
01:28:22,750 --> 01:28:27,040
Now look at them as one.

1041
01:28:31,375 --> 01:28:35,165
Look closely. You will see
the plough taking shape.

1042
01:28:55,541 --> 01:28:56,957
I can see it!

1043
01:28:57,375 --> 01:28:58,957
Yes, plough!

1044
01:29:03,541 --> 01:29:05,040
So what we must understand is this:

1045
01:29:05,666 --> 01:29:07,749
By observing these stars,

1046
01:29:08,375 --> 01:29:12,332
we can make anything we want.

1047
01:29:13,750 --> 01:29:18,374
Yet if we look at just one star,
though it may be beautiful...

1048
01:29:20,875 --> 01:29:23,749
...it is only a shimmering, solitary star.

1049
01:30:00,958 --> 01:30:08,040
This star, that star, every star

1050
01:30:08,375 --> 01:30:11,832
Whichever one you see looks lovely

1051
01:30:12,166 --> 01:30:15,374
This star, that star, every star

1052
01:30:15,541 --> 01:30:18,957
When all these gather together in the night,

1053
01:30:19,166 --> 01:30:22,749
the whole sky shimmers!

1054
01:30:22,958 --> 01:30:26,332
When all these gather together in the night,

1055
01:30:26,541 --> 01:30:30,249
the whole sky shimmers!

1056
01:30:30,541 --> 01:30:33,374
Twinkling stars, two stars, nine stars,

1057
01:30:33,541 --> 01:30:35,374
a hundred stars!
They glitter as one,

1058
01:30:35,541 --> 01:30:39,749
but each is a fiery spark!

1059
01:31:12,958 --> 01:31:15,749
If you have seen a rainbow,

1060
01:31:16,708 --> 01:31:20,040
then tell me, how many colors are there in it?

1061
01:31:20,375 --> 01:31:23,749
There are seven colors to speak of,

1062
01:31:24,166 --> 01:31:27,540
yet how many shades does the company keep?

1063
01:31:27,750 --> 01:31:31,374
Just think, if each of these colors were alone,

1064
01:31:31,541 --> 01:31:34,957
how would a rainbow ever form?

1065
01:31:35,166 --> 01:31:38,749
Likewise, if we couldn't
manage to unite to fight injustice,

1066
01:31:38,958 --> 01:31:41,957
then there would be no community

1067
01:31:42,166 --> 01:31:45,749
So don't ask why we are so weak and defeated!

1068
01:31:45,958 --> 01:31:49,749
Hmmm... stars, stars!

1069
01:31:49,958 --> 01:32:00,749
This star, that star, every star

1070
01:32:01,083 --> 01:32:04,374
Whichever one you see looks lovely

1071
01:32:04,541 --> 01:32:07,957
When all these gather together in the night,

1072
01:32:08,166 --> 01:32:11,957
the whole sky shimmers!

1073
01:32:12,166 --> 01:32:15,540
Twinkling stars, two stars, nine stars, a hundred stars!

1074
01:32:15,750 --> 01:32:16,750
They glitter as one,

1075
01:32:16,751 --> 01:32:20,749
but each is a fiery spark!

1076
01:33:01,958 --> 01:33:05,332
Individual drops, joining together,

1077
01:33:05,666 --> 01:33:08,957
make a river

1078
01:33:09,375 --> 01:33:12,749
Every drop makes the sea;

1079
01:33:12,958 --> 01:33:16,540
otherwise, what is this sea?

1080
01:33:16,750 --> 01:33:20,374
Understand this puzzle:
A drop existing on its own, just as a drop,

1081
01:33:20,541 --> 01:33:23,874
is hardly anything

1082
01:33:24,083 --> 01:33:27,749
Were we to forsake others,
turn our backs on everyone,

1083
01:33:27,958 --> 01:33:30,957
we would end up feeling incredibly lonely

1084
01:33:31,166 --> 01:33:34,749
Why not join together and become a current?

1085
01:33:34,958 --> 01:33:38,749
Hmmm... stars, stars

1086
01:33:38,958 --> 01:33:45,749
This star, that star, every star

1087
01:33:46,291 --> 01:33:49,415
Whichever one you see looks lovely

1088
01:33:49,958 --> 01:33:53,165
This star, that star, every star

1089
01:33:53,458 --> 01:33:56,957
When all these gather together in the night,

1090
01:33:57,166 --> 01:34:00,874
the whole sky shimmers!

1091
01:34:01,083 --> 01:34:02,957
Twinkling stars, two stars,

1092
01:34:03,166 --> 01:34:06,374
nine stars, a hundred stars!
They glitter as one,

1093
01:34:06,541 --> 01:34:09,165
but each star's a fiery spark!

1094
01:34:39,750 --> 01:34:46,957
The farmer who ploughs the land
brings forth gold from the earth

1095
01:34:47,166 --> 01:34:54,540
The cowherd who raises the cattle
is rewarded with a river of milk

1096
01:34:58,291 --> 01:35:05,290
The blacksmith who shapes the iron
makes every tool of his shine

1097
01:35:05,541 --> 01:35:12,749
The potter who holds the mud
molds clay into a pot

1098
01:35:12,958 --> 01:35:16,540
All these are faces of labor,
desiring to do something

1099
01:35:16,750 --> 01:35:20,165
No one has enmity with anyone else

1100
01:35:20,375 --> 01:35:27,374
All have the same dreams, all are the same
No one is a stranger to another

1101
01:35:27,541 --> 01:35:30,749
This is a simple matter; understand, my friends

1102
01:35:30,958 --> 01:35:35,082
Hmmm... stars, stars

1103
01:35:35,291 --> 01:35:41,957
This star, that star, every star

1104
01:35:42,541 --> 01:35:45,874
Whichever one you see looks lovely

1105
01:35:46,208 --> 01:35:49,332
This star, that star, every star

1106
01:35:49,750 --> 01:35:53,165
When all these gather together in the night,

1107
01:35:53,458 --> 01:35:57,165
the whole sky shimmers!

1108
01:35:57,375 --> 01:35:59,165
Twinkling stars, two stars,

1109
01:35:59,375 --> 01:36:01,957
nine stars, a hundred stars!
They glitter as one,

1110
01:36:02,166 --> 01:36:06,165
but each is a fiery spark!

1111
01:36:45,541 --> 01:36:46,165
Gita?

1112
01:36:50,041 --> 01:36:52,082
I want to talk to you
about something important.

1113
01:36:53,375 --> 01:36:54,749
I can't hold it back any longer.

1114
01:36:56,541 --> 01:36:57,374
Go on.

1115
01:36:59,541 --> 01:37:01,749
I had recognized you at the bookstore in Delhi.

1116
01:37:03,208 --> 01:37:05,749
And I had guessed that you had
come to take Kaveriamma away.

1117
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,040
You did not make a mistake
on the way to Charanpur.

1118
01:37:10,958 --> 01:37:13,165
I had deliberately given
you the wrong directions.

1119
01:37:15,833 --> 01:37:17,540
Really? Why?

1120
01:37:19,541 --> 01:37:20,957
Call me childish,

1121
01:37:22,291 --> 01:37:24,874
but I did not want you to come here...

1122
01:37:26,291 --> 01:37:27,499
...and meet Kaveriamma.

1123
01:37:29,375 --> 01:37:33,874
For all that you're doing for the
school, I'd like to thank you.

1124
01:37:35,458 --> 01:37:37,749
But I cannot let you take Kaveriamma away.

1125
01:37:37,958 --> 01:37:38,749
Why?

1126
01:37:39,541 --> 01:37:40,957
You want her so that...

1127
01:37:41,958 --> 01:37:44,957
...she can take care of your
house and do all the chores.

1128
01:37:45,166 --> 01:37:46,165
How dare you say that?

1129
01:37:46,958 --> 01:37:48,540
How can you accuse me of such a motive?

1130
01:37:48,958 --> 01:37:50,749
I've traveled 12,000 miles
only out of concern for...

1131
01:37:51,541 --> 01:37:52,957
...Kaveriamma's well being.

1132
01:37:53,291 --> 01:37:55,082
If you were so concerned,

1133
01:37:55,500 --> 01:37:57,874
then where were you when
she was put in an old-age home?

1134
01:37:58,375 --> 01:38:00,040
It was I who traced her and brought her here.

1135
01:38:00,958 --> 01:38:01,874
Maybe that's because...

1136
01:38:02,291 --> 01:38:07,749
...you needed someone to take
care of Chikku and your house.

1137
01:38:11,958 --> 01:38:13,749
Why did you come back?

1138
01:38:15,458 --> 01:38:17,082
Why did you have to come back?

1139
01:38:19,541 --> 01:38:21,374
We were so happy.

1140
01:38:23,166 --> 01:38:25,040
And you have everything you need, right?

1141
01:38:27,833 --> 01:38:31,749
We only have Kaveriamma.

1142
01:38:33,958 --> 01:38:36,040
You are not the only one who loves her.

1143
01:38:39,750 --> 01:38:41,499
I know she is like a mother to you...

1144
01:38:42,750 --> 01:38:44,415
...and you like a son to her.

1145
01:38:44,958 --> 01:38:51,040
But she is a mother to me, too.

1146
01:38:54,541 --> 01:38:58,749
And I don't want to become an orphan again.

1147
01:39:03,041 --> 01:39:04,374
I understand, Gita.

1148
01:39:08,166 --> 01:39:10,665
I will not allow you to take
Kaveriamma away from me.

1149
01:39:15,750 --> 01:39:17,957
Kaveriamma will come with me to America.

1150
01:39:21,541 --> 01:39:24,749
Whether you like it... or not.

1151
01:39:49,166 --> 01:39:51,165
I stuck between a rock and a hard place, Fatima.

1152
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:56,374
Mohan is asking me to go with him,
while Gita expects me to be here.

1153
01:39:56,541 --> 01:39:58,749
I just don't know what to do.

1154
01:39:58,958 --> 01:40:02,332
Allah knows that when Mohan arrived,
I was so happy for you.

1155
01:40:02,541 --> 01:40:05,540
But I never thought things
would get into such a tangle.

1156
01:40:05,750 --> 01:40:09,040
You'll have to disappoint
one or the other.

1157
01:40:09,458 --> 01:40:15,165
I'm not sure whether I should
go to America with Mohan or not.

1158
01:40:15,791 --> 01:40:21,540
I don't understand why he
wants to take you to America.

1159
01:40:21,750 --> 01:40:25,957
To work there? Did you ask him?

1160
01:40:26,958 --> 01:40:33,374
No, Fatima. He loves me.
He'd take good care of me.

1161
01:40:33,625 --> 01:40:36,374
Allah, I hope you are right, Kaveri.

1162
01:40:37,083 --> 01:40:40,165
Otherwise, who is to know
what tomorrow has in store?

1163
01:40:44,208 --> 01:40:48,332
Kaveri, why don't you ask Mohan to stay here?

1164
01:40:49,375 --> 01:40:52,332
No, he won't agree.

1165
01:40:53,083 --> 01:40:54,957
Remember one thing...

1166
01:40:55,791 --> 01:40:59,624
...every piece of ice inevitably melts in its own water.

1167
01:40:59,958 --> 01:41:02,540
Make him understand this perfectly.

1168
01:41:22,958 --> 01:41:23,874
We played a lot.

1169
01:41:26,958 --> 01:41:28,165
Kaveriamma!

1170
01:41:28,875 --> 01:41:31,165
You can stop looking for a groom for me!

1171
01:41:32,250 --> 01:41:35,165
I have decided not to get
married at this point.

1172
01:41:35,541 --> 01:41:36,749
What did you say?

1173
01:41:37,875 --> 01:41:43,874
Yes. I want to focus all my time on
the children and the school's progress.

1174
01:41:45,291 --> 01:41:47,749
That's all right, but...

1175
01:41:48,375 --> 01:41:51,165
Furthermore, I'm not
yet prepared for marriage.

1176
01:41:59,166 --> 01:42:02,165
Well done!

1177
01:42:03,041 --> 01:42:05,499
That was a good move
to stall Kaveriamma from leaving.

1178
01:42:08,041 --> 01:42:11,540
Though, who'd want to marry you, anyway?

1179
01:42:12,750 --> 01:42:15,165
Now, don't get me wrong!
I'm not saying you're not beautiful.

1180
01:42:15,666 --> 01:42:20,874
But that attitude, all those
ideals and principles...

1181
01:42:21,541 --> 01:42:22,624
Who'd suffer through it?

1182
01:42:23,958 --> 01:42:26,499
It's a good thing you've
decided to opt yourself out.

1183
01:42:27,750 --> 01:42:32,415
But there is one crazy guy
who might want to marry you.

1184
01:42:47,291 --> 01:42:49,874
Yes, Mohan, the precipitation
measurement list has been drawn up.

1185
01:42:50,083 --> 01:42:52,624
You understand what I'm saying?
- Yes, Vinod. Yeah.

1186
01:42:53,375 --> 01:42:57,749
Okay - we've tested the dual frequency radar,
and the horizontal and vertical resolution is just fine.

1187
01:42:57,958 --> 01:43:04,874
Yeah, but the waveforms need to
match with the longitudinal parabolas.

1188
01:43:05,083 --> 01:43:06,957
Of course, of course.
They work in alignment.

1189
01:43:07,541 --> 01:43:08,374
Nivaaran ji...

1190
01:43:09,166 --> 01:43:11,165
Here, speak to Steve. 
- Hi, Mohan.

1191
01:43:11,541 --> 01:43:15,332
Steve, what about the
geometrical axis function?

1192
01:43:16,375 --> 01:43:20,957
Yeah, that's been calibrated. 
The baseline parameter's been optimized.

1193
01:43:21,750 --> 01:43:26,874
See, the sun-sync orbit needs to be in
alignment with the radiometers of the TRMM.

1194
01:43:28,166 --> 01:43:30,540
Okay, I'll make the remaining readings,
and call you in a couple of days?

1195
01:43:30,750 --> 01:43:31,749
Okay. Thanks.

1196
01:43:32,666 --> 01:43:36,040
Hey, Mohan. So, how's everything else?

1197
01:43:36,458 --> 01:43:38,165
Everything is fine. All is well.

1198
01:43:39,083 --> 01:43:41,165
So, have you found yourself a village belle?

1199
01:43:41,375 --> 01:43:42,499
Actually, you could say I have.

1200
01:43:42,750 --> 01:43:43,540
What?

1201
01:43:44,458 --> 01:43:46,540
You're kidding me, right?
- No.

1202
01:43:48,166 --> 01:43:50,040
Who's she? What's her name?

1203
01:43:50,750 --> 01:43:53,957
Her name is Gita.
Kaveriamma lives with her.

1204
01:43:54,541 --> 01:43:56,040
I don't believe this.

1205
01:43:56,541 --> 01:43:58,374
Except she's no village belle.

1206
01:43:58,750 --> 01:44:01,332
She studied in Delhi,
and now she runs a school here.

1207
01:44:01,541 --> 01:44:02,374
Anyway...

1208
01:44:02,958 --> 01:44:05,000
Have you told her?
Does she know?

1209
01:44:06,041 --> 01:44:07,957
How can I tell her?
- What do you mean?

1210
01:44:08,458 --> 01:44:09,249
I mean...

1211
01:44:10,541 --> 01:44:15,874
I mean she's got a different set
of ideals and all. I like a simple girl.

1212
01:44:16,458 --> 01:44:18,874
Come on! You can't make that mistake.

1213
01:44:19,458 --> 01:44:20,957
You have to tell her how you feel.

1214
01:44:21,375 --> 01:44:22,957
All right. If you say so.

1215
01:44:23,166 --> 01:44:25,374
Listen, I'll catch up with you later.
I gotta go now.

1216
01:44:25,541 --> 01:44:28,374
Hey... your two weeks are almost up!

1217
01:44:28,875 --> 01:44:30,957
Yeah, I know.

1218
01:44:31,541 --> 01:44:32,749
I'll be back soon.

1219
01:44:32,958 --> 01:44:36,082
You should have been back already.
- Well, let me propose to her first.

1220
01:44:36,916 --> 01:44:39,374
I'll be leaving soon.
Catch up with you later. Bye.

1221
01:44:39,666 --> 01:44:40,540
Bye.

1222
01:44:43,041 --> 01:44:44,374
Gurnaam ji, how much was that?

1223
01:44:48,125 --> 01:44:50,749
32 minutes. Is it okay if I pay tomorrow?
- Yes.

1224
01:44:51,375 --> 01:44:54,665
My apologies, Mohan babu.
The electricity is problematic here.

1225
01:45:27,958 --> 01:45:30,499
Why are you trying to
corrupt Chikku's mind?

1226
01:45:30,750 --> 01:45:32,332
What are you talking about?
I don't understand.

1227
01:45:32,541 --> 01:45:36,332
Oh, really? Haven't you been talking to 
him and his friends about going to America?

1228
01:45:36,541 --> 01:45:38,082
No, Gita, I was just explaining...

1229
01:45:38,291 --> 01:45:42,665
Am I teaching these kids so that they can go
abroad, settle down, and never come back, like you?

1230
01:45:42,875 --> 01:45:44,874
You NRI! Non-Returning Indian.

1231
01:45:49,291 --> 01:45:51,040
Hand me the pitcher, please.

1232
01:45:53,041 --> 01:45:56,332
You don't even know how to take a bath.
You should learn from Chikku.

1233
01:45:56,541 --> 01:45:58,165
Gita, I think you need a change.

1234
01:45:58,375 --> 01:46:00,290
Why don't you come back 
with me for a vacation?

1235
01:46:02,958 --> 01:46:04,957
You are very mischievous, Gita.
Where's the bucket?

1236
01:46:05,166 --> 01:46:06,749
Listen...
- No. You listen to me first.

1237
01:46:06,958 --> 01:46:10,749
What is it?
- I like you very much... Gitli!

1238
01:46:11,208 --> 01:46:13,415
What?
- Yes, Gitli.

1239
01:46:13,666 --> 01:46:18,374
I liked the way you disciplined
that man in the bookstore.

1240
01:46:18,750 --> 01:46:23,374
Don't try to sweet talk me.
Kaveriamma will stay here... with me!

1241
01:46:23,541 --> 01:46:26,540
You're misunderstanding.
I really like you.

1242
01:46:26,750 --> 01:46:29,957
Shut up! And don't you try
to corrupt the kids again, okay?

1243
01:46:30,166 --> 01:46:32,957
I'm not corrupting anyone.
I'm just bathing.

1244
01:46:37,375 --> 01:46:39,540
More than the kids, you're the
one who needs an education!

1245
01:46:45,875 --> 01:46:47,749
You can continue calling out
to your Kaveriamma now.

1246
01:47:03,375 --> 01:47:07,332
All right now, remove your notebooks.
The topic is general knowledge.

1247
01:47:08,541 --> 01:47:09,499
So, who will tell me...

1248
01:47:09,875 --> 01:47:13,665
...the names of five of the most
important rivers in the country?

1249
01:47:16,375 --> 01:47:17,749
I'm sorry to be late, teacher.

1250
01:47:29,875 --> 01:47:30,540
Look ahead.

1251
01:47:36,166 --> 01:47:38,040
Today, he'll be taking your class.

1252
01:47:40,958 --> 01:47:42,040
First question.

1253
01:47:42,875 --> 01:47:45,332
What are the names of five main rivers in India?

1254
01:47:47,875 --> 01:47:48,749
You.

1255
01:47:50,833 --> 01:47:51,749
Tell me!

1256
01:47:54,250 --> 01:47:55,040
Let me think.

1257
01:47:57,958 --> 01:48:01,332
Ganga, Jamuna, Narmada...

1258
01:48:04,958 --> 01:48:05,957
...Bharati...

1259
01:48:08,250 --> 01:48:09,374
...Panchgani...

1260
01:48:09,541 --> 01:48:13,165
Bharati? Panchgani?
Are they rivers?

1261
01:48:15,666 --> 01:48:17,249
Vidya, you tell me.

1262
01:48:17,750 --> 01:48:22,165
Ganga, Jamuna, Narmada...
Godavari and Brahmaputra.

1263
01:48:27,166 --> 01:48:28,290
Excellent, Vidya!

1264
01:48:30,541 --> 01:48:31,540
Second question.

1265
01:48:33,041 --> 01:48:37,332
What is the name of the new state that
has been formed in northwest India?

1266
01:48:39,416 --> 01:48:43,082
I know this one.
It was a part of Uttar Pradesh, right?

1267
01:48:48,166 --> 01:48:49,540
Yes Chikku. You tell us!

1268
01:48:49,958 --> 01:48:51,540
It's Uttaranchal!
- Oh yes, Uttaranchal!

1269
01:48:51,750 --> 01:48:54,332
How could I have missed it?
I forgot!

1270
01:48:54,833 --> 01:48:55,749
Well done, Chikku!

1271
01:48:57,750 --> 01:48:59,290
Now the last question.

1272
01:48:59,875 --> 01:49:02,749
If our new student does
not know the answer,

1273
01:49:03,958 --> 01:49:06,165
we'll have to demote him to a lower class.

1274
01:49:23,166 --> 01:49:25,540
How many lion heads does
the Ashoka pillar have?

1275
01:49:30,750 --> 01:49:31,957
This one is easy.

1276
01:49:32,708 --> 01:49:33,540
Three.

1277
01:49:33,875 --> 01:49:36,499
No! Four!

1278
01:49:39,541 --> 01:49:42,624
Excellent, children!
The lesson of the day is...

1279
01:49:42,833 --> 01:49:44,957
...before gaining knowledge about foreign lands,

1280
01:49:45,291 --> 01:49:47,957
it is important for one to
know one's own country.

1281
01:49:54,708 --> 01:49:56,290
Don't forget to do your homework.

1282
01:50:04,875 --> 01:50:07,832
The rivers Ganga and Jamuna have
their confluence point in Allahabad.

1283
01:50:08,833 --> 01:50:10,165
The new state Uttaranchal...

1284
01:50:10,958 --> 01:50:13,480
...is the 27th state of India,
with Dehradun as its capital -

1285
01:50:13,481 --> 01:50:17,082
and this is the land where
the Mahabharata was written.

1286
01:50:17,875 --> 01:50:20,165
The Ashoka pillar rests
on a circular abacus,

1287
01:50:20,375 --> 01:50:23,332
which is guarded by four animals.

1288
01:50:24,041 --> 01:50:29,704
The bull by the west side, the elephant by
the east, the horse by the south, and...

1289
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:33,957
...the lion by the north.

1290
01:50:38,750 --> 01:50:44,540
Gita, the blackboard is clean.

1291
01:50:52,750 --> 01:50:54,165
Gita, I am...

1292
01:50:58,958 --> 01:50:59,957
Gita!

1293
01:51:04,708 --> 01:51:06,249
But all my answers were correct.

1294
01:51:07,125 --> 01:51:11,040
This is Natthu, the potter,
and this is Shankar...

1295
01:51:11,250 --> 01:51:12,374
...he makes baskets.

1296
01:51:12,541 --> 01:51:16,540
Both of them want us to
admit their children to the school.

1297
01:51:16,916 --> 01:51:20,040
What Mohan babu said to us
the other day touched our hearts.

1298
01:51:20,291 --> 01:51:23,832
We don't want our
children to suffer like us.

1299
01:51:24,916 --> 01:51:27,249
On the morning of Dussehra,
(Indian festival)

1300
01:51:27,458 --> 01:51:30,249
you can come and enroll
your children in the school.

1301
01:51:30,458 --> 01:51:31,374
Yes, okay.

1302
01:51:36,208 --> 01:51:38,040
The tides have begun
to change direction.

1303
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:40,040
Haven't they?

1304
01:51:50,333 --> 01:51:51,374
I'm sorry.

1305
01:52:03,500 --> 01:52:06,249
Mohan!
- Yes?

1306
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:10,874
Mohan, I have some work for you.
- What work?

1307
01:52:11,083 --> 01:52:13,582
There's a place called Kodi
a few miles from here.

1308
01:52:13,791 --> 01:52:16,332
Gita has some family property there...

1309
01:52:16,541 --> 01:52:19,165
...which has been leased to a
farmer called Haridas.

1310
01:52:19,375 --> 01:52:21,832
He has not paid his rent for some months.

1311
01:52:22,166 --> 01:52:23,624
I want you to go and collect the money.

1312
01:52:24,083 --> 01:52:25,290
Me?

1313
01:52:26,750 --> 01:52:29,207
But why do you want me to go?
Can't you send someone else?

1314
01:52:29,500 --> 01:52:32,790
If you go and ask, he just might pay up.

1315
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,999
Oh! So you want me to be a collector now!

1316
01:52:36,291 --> 01:52:40,540
Okay, when should I leave?
I have to fuel up the caravan.

1317
01:52:41,041 --> 01:52:43,040
You have to leave now.
- Now?

1318
01:52:43,250 --> 01:52:46,915
Yes, and you can't take the caravan there.
- Then?

1319
01:52:47,125 --> 01:52:49,540
You will have to take the train
for three hours to Narsinga...

1320
01:52:49,708 --> 01:52:51,832
...then a boatjourney across
the river to Maangaon...

1321
01:52:52,083 --> 01:52:55,249
...and finally three hours by bus...
and then you'll have reached Kodi!

1322
01:52:55,583 --> 01:53:00,499
Sure, that's pretty close by.
- Yes. You'll return by tomorrow evening.

1323
01:53:00,916 --> 01:53:04,957
And Mela Ram will go with you.
He knows the way.

1324
01:53:06,541 --> 01:53:08,540
Kaveriamma.
- Yes?

1325
01:53:10,666 --> 01:53:14,665
My vacation is nearing its end.
What have you decided?

1326
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,040
You finish this work first.

1327
01:53:25,375 --> 01:53:26,582
Come on, collector saheb.

1328
01:53:31,500 --> 01:53:32,874
Why are you sending Mohan?

1329
01:53:33,083 --> 01:53:35,624
I sent Haridas a message
only a few days ago.

1330
01:53:37,083 --> 01:53:39,374
I know what I'm doing.

1331
01:53:48,791 --> 01:53:51,540
Good morning, sir!
- Good morning, Mela Ram.

1332
01:53:51,750 --> 01:53:54,290
I'm all set to take you on a
sightseeing trip of the village.

1333
01:54:02,041 --> 01:54:03,332
Okay, we're going now.

1334
01:54:03,708 --> 01:54:06,582
Mohan bhaiyya, you'll bring
me back a toy, won't you?

1335
01:54:06,791 --> 01:54:09,999
Of course. Gimme five... yes!

1336
01:54:20,708 --> 01:54:23,124
And what shall I bring back for you?

1337
01:54:24,125 --> 01:54:25,040
Nothing.

1338
01:54:27,500 --> 01:54:32,207
I know you don't want me to leave,
but I have to go for Kaveriamma.

1339
01:54:33,541 --> 01:54:35,880
Now look, don't think about me too much.

1340
01:54:35,881 --> 01:54:38,749
I mean, don't miss me too much.

1341
01:54:39,750 --> 01:54:42,915
Now what makes you think that I'll miss you?

1342
01:54:43,791 --> 01:54:44,874
Your eyes.

1343
01:54:47,416 --> 01:54:48,540
They give everything away.

1344
01:55:32,708 --> 01:55:35,624
My love, my love

1345
01:55:35,833 --> 01:55:38,957
I have become crazy

1346
01:55:39,166 --> 01:55:42,374
You have won me over

1347
01:55:42,541 --> 01:55:45,707
Oh, my love...

1348
01:55:49,416 --> 01:55:52,332
My love, my love

1349
01:55:52,500 --> 01:55:55,624
I have become crazy

1350
01:55:55,833 --> 01:55:59,040
You have won me over

1351
01:55:59,250 --> 01:56:02,374
Oh, my love...

1352
01:56:02,583 --> 01:56:05,624
This heart is in turmoil

1353
01:56:05,833 --> 01:56:08,957
This body is left to smolder

1354
01:56:09,166 --> 01:56:12,374
It's raining dreams

1355
01:56:12,541 --> 01:56:15,624
The eyes have found a home

1356
01:56:15,833 --> 01:56:19,165
The heart spills over

1357
01:56:19,375 --> 01:56:26,124
Oh, my love...

1358
01:57:02,791 --> 01:57:09,332
Now that you have come close to me,
now that you have invaded my heart,

1359
01:57:09,500 --> 01:57:16,540
how can I express what has happened?

1360
01:57:17,791 --> 01:57:20,915
Somewhere, there are blossoming heartbeats

1361
01:57:21,125 --> 01:57:24,249
Somewhere, there are paths of dreams

1362
01:57:24,416 --> 01:57:25,624
How can I express the joy in my heart?

1363
01:57:25,625 --> 01:57:27,790
How can I express the joy in my heart?

1364
01:57:27,791 --> 01:57:30,249
How can I express the joy in my heart?

1365
01:57:30,458 --> 01:57:33,624
You've made me lose control

1366
01:57:33,833 --> 01:57:38,040
Oftentimes I'm embarrassed

1367
01:57:39,333 --> 01:57:42,290
It seems I have forgotten my way

1368
01:57:42,583 --> 01:57:48,999
ever since I have seen the city of love

1369
01:57:49,208 --> 01:57:55,499
City of love

1370
01:57:55,916 --> 01:57:59,040
My love...

1371
01:57:59,250 --> 01:58:02,374
I have become crazy

1372
01:58:02,583 --> 01:58:05,749
You have won me over

1373
01:58:05,958 --> 01:58:09,124
Oh, my love

1374
01:58:46,791 --> 01:58:53,332
Now that I have found you,
this whole atmosphere has changed

1375
01:58:53,500 --> 01:58:59,957
Flowers have begun to trouble my path

1376
01:59:00,166 --> 01:59:06,582
I feel as though the earth is renewed

1377
01:59:06,791 --> 01:59:13,415
and a new sky has been formed from our love

1378
01:59:13,791 --> 01:59:17,124
The wanton breeze sings a melody

1379
01:59:17,333 --> 01:59:22,374
The flowing river narrates a tale

1380
01:59:22,583 --> 01:59:29,165
Since our eyes met, my sweetheart,

1381
01:59:29,375 --> 01:59:35,749
I have lost my senses

1382
01:59:35,958 --> 01:59:42,415
My love...

1383
01:59:58,625 --> 02:00:06,374
Haridas ji!

1384
02:00:07,333 --> 02:00:08,124
Yes?

1385
02:00:14,083 --> 02:00:16,290
I'm Mela Ram and this is
Mohan Bhargav ji.

1386
02:00:16,875 --> 02:00:17,707
Tell me what's going on.

1387
02:00:18,041 --> 02:00:22,915
Kaveri ji and Gita ji have sent me.
It's about the rent.

1388
02:00:25,041 --> 02:00:26,124
I understand.

1389
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,374
Come in.

1390
02:00:36,416 --> 02:00:41,332
You have traveled a long way.
You must be tired. Please rest.

1391
02:00:41,750 --> 02:00:43,915
I think they could do with some bread.

1392
02:00:44,833 --> 02:00:47,124
Run along now.

1393
02:00:48,083 --> 02:00:48,915
Please come in.

1394
02:01:06,916 --> 02:01:09,165
You really shouldn't have bothered.

1395
02:01:10,791 --> 02:01:14,707
How is that possible?
A guest is like God.

1396
02:01:15,708 --> 02:01:18,290
We've served what we have;
you eat and then we'll talk.

1397
02:01:19,625 --> 02:01:20,499
Okay.

1398
02:01:35,583 --> 02:01:39,374
If I had the capacity to pay,
I would have come to Charanpur myself.

1399
02:01:40,625 --> 02:01:43,957
Sir, I was a weaver before I took up farming.

1400
02:01:45,958 --> 02:01:47,957
Since the advent of machine
woven fabrics in the market,

1401
02:01:49,208 --> 02:01:50,915
weaving has ceased to
be a lucrative business.

1402
02:01:52,583 --> 02:01:57,290
So I became a farmer.
I took Gita ji's land on lease.

1403
02:01:58,791 --> 02:02:05,124
I imagined once the crops flourished,
the children's lives would improve.

1404
02:02:07,125 --> 02:02:08,915
But it was not to be.

1405
02:02:10,958 --> 02:02:11,832
How do you mean?

1406
02:02:13,250 --> 02:02:16,540
By taking up farming,
I had changed my profession.

1407
02:02:18,708 --> 02:02:23,707
The village elders did not accept this,
and looked upon me as an outcast.

1408
02:02:25,958 --> 02:02:30,915
They felt a weaver should remain a weaver,
even if it meant he had to go hungry.

1409
02:02:33,041 --> 02:02:38,207
I cried, pleaded...
but no one listened.

1410
02:02:40,375 --> 02:02:44,415
Nobody offered a drop of
water to irrigate my land.

1411
02:02:46,875 --> 02:02:48,374
The entire crop dried up...

1412
02:02:49,916 --> 02:02:53,832
...and whatever survived,
the villagers refused to buy.

1413
02:02:55,791 --> 02:02:58,707
It is because of this I've not
been able to pay Gita ji's rent.

1414
02:03:00,916 --> 02:03:02,124
But this is wrong.

1415
02:03:05,250 --> 02:03:09,290
It's unfair. It's an outrage.

1416
02:03:10,250 --> 02:03:12,124
It is the way things work here.

1417
02:03:14,500 --> 02:03:16,165
Not enough food to fill our stomachs,

1418
02:03:17,458 --> 02:03:21,707
no clothes to wear,
no roof above our heads,

1419
02:03:23,041 --> 02:03:25,707
no education for children, no land.

1420
02:03:27,166 --> 02:03:32,707
The thirst in my heart alone
knows the taste of my tears.

1421
02:03:35,583 --> 02:03:36,915
So what did you do?

1422
02:03:37,250 --> 02:03:38,374
What could I do?

1423
02:03:39,750 --> 02:03:43,707
I thought about migrating to the city,
hoping life would be better there.

1424
02:03:45,625 --> 02:03:48,499
Those who had been there spoke of the anguish.

1425
02:03:50,208 --> 02:03:55,749
A laborer goes there to work
and falls into the grip of contractors.

1426
02:03:57,583 --> 02:04:00,165
He either returns hungry or never returns.

1427
02:04:01,583 --> 02:04:08,124
And soon, his wife has to
sell the little land she has.

1428
02:04:09,750 --> 02:04:11,207
No, sir. No.

1429
02:04:12,166 --> 02:04:16,040
I couldn't feed my children in this life...

1430
02:04:18,250 --> 02:04:19,832
...what is to happen after me?

1431
02:04:21,166 --> 02:04:24,124
And about Gita ji's money,

1432
02:04:25,791 --> 02:04:30,915
I have nothing to offer
but helplessness and shame.

1433
02:04:32,458 --> 02:04:33,499
Nothing...

1434
02:04:50,666 --> 02:04:54,290
Thank you for the food, Haridas ji.

1435
02:05:33,041 --> 02:05:34,332
Haridas ji, good bye.

1436
02:05:40,416 --> 02:05:44,290
Please don't mind. Here's
some money. Keep it.

1437
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:49,124
Mohan babu, it's very kind of you,
but I can't accept it.

1438
02:05:49,750 --> 02:05:51,332
Please Haridas ji, I want you to keep it.

1439
02:05:51,916 --> 02:05:54,290
When you want, you 
can return it to me.

1440
02:05:55,791 --> 02:05:58,707
But I don't know when 
I will be able repay it.

1441
02:06:01,166 --> 02:06:02,374
Don't worry about it.

1442
02:06:04,583 --> 02:06:09,040
Here chotu, this is for you.
Share it with your sisters.

1443
02:06:11,958 --> 02:06:17,040
Please give Gita ji
and Kaveri ji my respects.

1444
02:07:51,416 --> 02:08:11,915
Water for sale... water for sale...
25 paise for a glass...

1445
02:08:12,333 --> 02:08:16,707
25 paise for a glass of water...

1446
02:08:17,916 --> 02:08:19,332
Saheb, please have a glass of water.

1447
02:10:15,916 --> 02:10:17,124
You're back, Mohan.

1448
02:10:26,041 --> 02:10:27,374
How was your journey?

1449
02:10:28,916 --> 02:10:31,124
Okay.
- Did you meet Haridas?

1450
02:10:32,125 --> 02:10:35,124
Yes. But I couldn't get the money.

1451
02:10:39,833 --> 02:10:44,415
His situation is pathetic.
He can't pay the rent.

1452
02:10:44,791 --> 02:10:47,915
Instead, sir gave him money
from his own pocket before leaving.

1453
02:10:50,750 --> 02:10:52,915
I couldn't bear to see Haridas' situation.

1454
02:10:56,166 --> 02:10:58,290
I don't think you should
expect any rent from him.

1455
02:11:01,541 --> 02:11:03,374
Did you get me my toy, Mohan bhaiyya?

1456
02:11:07,708 --> 02:11:08,999
I couldn't get anything.

1457
02:11:13,458 --> 02:11:14,374
Come on, Chikku.

1458
02:11:22,916 --> 02:11:25,707
Mohan, this is the general state of affairs.

1459
02:11:27,791 --> 02:11:31,249
What is money when compared
to the value of human life?

1460
02:11:33,041 --> 02:11:35,207
I'm glad you gave him money.

1461
02:11:36,750 --> 02:11:41,374
Now, don't be upset, son.
Rest a little.

1462
02:11:56,750 --> 02:11:57,915
Kaveriamma!

1463
02:11:59,666 --> 02:12:01,040
How do I wrap this around?

1464
02:12:07,250 --> 02:12:09,915
Kaveriamma has left for school.
For the decorations.

1465
02:12:10,458 --> 02:12:13,415
I don't know why she
wants me to wear this dhoti.

1466
02:12:13,708 --> 02:12:15,457
What's wrong with my jeans, anyway?

1467
02:12:15,666 --> 02:12:18,707
It is the appropriate thing
to wear on Dussehra.

1468
02:12:19,166 --> 02:12:20,290
If you want, I can tie it for you.

1469
02:12:20,458 --> 02:12:23,082
How do you know?
Have you ever worn one?

1470
02:12:23,375 --> 02:12:24,707
It's not a saree, okay?

1471
02:12:25,125 --> 02:12:26,790
Fine, then. Do it yourself.

1472
02:12:26,900 --> 02:12:31,402
No! You can tie it.
Just do it quickly, please.

1473
02:12:31,958 --> 02:12:32,749
Come here...

1474
02:12:37,791 --> 02:12:38,624
Give...

1475
02:12:41,125 --> 02:12:41,915
Hold it.

1476
02:13:01,250 --> 02:13:02,124
What the...

1477
02:13:42,583 --> 02:13:43,707
There, it's done.

1478
02:13:48,083 --> 02:13:49,207
Sure, it's done.

1479
02:13:49,958 --> 02:13:53,540
But I hope it doesn't
unravel in a crowd. Or else...

1480
02:13:53,750 --> 02:13:54,707
Shut up.

1481
02:13:57,541 --> 02:14:01,249
Today is the auspicious day of Dussehra.
It was on this day that Lord Rama...

1482
02:14:01,416 --> 02:14:06,915
slayed Ravana and marked
the triumph of good over evil.

1483
02:14:07,125 --> 02:14:10,332
I am very happy that on this day,
we initiate new students into the school.

1484
02:14:10,500 --> 02:14:13,540
May the Goddess of Knowledge be with you.

1485
02:14:27,666 --> 02:14:28,624
It's Lajwa.

1486
02:14:37,500 --> 02:14:40,040
This is our little granddaughter, Kusum!

1487
02:14:45,166 --> 02:14:47,082
Now, go and play!

1488
02:14:52,166 --> 02:14:58,040
Hey, Mohan ji, where are you off to?
Why don't you spend some time with us?

1489
02:14:59,875 --> 02:15:03,249
I'm impressed. How well you've tied your dhoti!

1490
02:15:03,541 --> 02:15:05,165
How did you manage to learn so quickly?

1491
02:15:05,541 --> 02:15:08,124
It's pretty easy. It was tied in seconds.

1492
02:15:08,333 --> 02:15:09,915
You're looking like a bridegroom.

1493
02:15:12,833 --> 02:15:13,624
Thank you.

1494
02:15:13,875 --> 02:15:17,832
So, Mohan babu, how long 
have you been living abroad?

1495
02:15:18,333 --> 02:15:20,624
It's been almost twelve years now.

1496
02:15:20,916 --> 02:15:23,790
You must have adapted yourself
completely to their way of living.

1497
02:15:25,375 --> 02:15:30,749
Bhai, we would like to know
a thing or two about America.

1498
02:15:31,625 --> 02:15:36,540
What can I tell you?
Well, America is a big country...

1499
02:15:36,875 --> 02:15:40,624
We've heard that it's also very rich?

1500
02:15:41,333 --> 02:15:44,582
It is rich. But there are 
several reasons for that.

1501
02:15:44,916 --> 02:15:49,540
One among them is that the land
is rich, especially in minerals...

1502
02:15:49,791 --> 02:15:53,165
Our land is rich as well, but in crops.

1503
02:15:53,583 --> 02:15:55,957
Our strength... lies in our fields.

1504
02:15:56,458 --> 02:15:58,624
Do they have problems of rain?

1505
02:15:58,833 --> 02:16:02,415
Are they affected by drought and famine like us?

1506
02:16:02,666 --> 02:16:03,957
And what about electricity?

1507
02:16:08,250 --> 02:16:12,457
They've set up an infrastructure that
provides many resources to the average person.

1508
02:16:12,666 --> 02:16:18,665
Electricity, housing, healthy
food, free education, water...

1509
02:16:18,875 --> 02:16:26,249
But we have one thing they
don't have and will never have.

1510
02:16:28,041 --> 02:16:28,915
What?

1511
02:16:29,791 --> 02:16:32,082
Culture and tradition.

1512
02:16:32,291 --> 02:16:33,499
Yes, bhai, yes.

1513
02:16:33,708 --> 02:16:39,582
And as long as we have them,
no one or thing can destroy us.

1514
02:16:40,291 --> 02:16:43,832
Ours is the greatest country in the world!

1515
02:16:44,500 --> 02:16:45,415
Yes, bhai!

1516
02:16:45,625 --> 02:16:51,040
Culture and tradition is our strong point,
don't you think so?

1517
02:16:55,041 --> 02:16:56,040
Munishwar...

1518
02:16:57,708 --> 02:17:02,415
I don't think... that Mohan agrees.

1519
02:17:02,833 --> 02:17:04,040
Do you, Mohan ji?

1520
02:17:05,250 --> 02:17:05,874
You're right.

1521
02:17:07,250 --> 02:17:09,957
I don't agree that ours is the 
greatest country in the world.

1522
02:17:15,041 --> 02:17:20,332
But I do believe that we have the
potential and strength to become great.

1523
02:17:22,708 --> 02:17:27,707
Look, these two countries are
politically and culturally very different.

1524
02:17:28,708 --> 02:17:33,124
Maybe I shouldn't say this, but since you
have broached the subject, let me tell you that...

1525
02:17:34,166 --> 02:17:36,832
...whenever we suspect losing in comparison,

1526
02:17:37,500 --> 02:17:39,165
we clutch on to our favorite refuge:

1527
02:17:41,083 --> 02:17:42,040
Culture...

1528
02:17:42,833 --> 02:17:43,749
...and tradition.

1529
02:17:45,958 --> 02:17:47,374
America has progressed
on its own strengths.

1530
02:17:47,625 --> 02:17:49,874
They have their own culture
and their own traditions.

1531
02:17:50,083 --> 02:17:53,290
It's silly to claim that their culture,

1532
02:17:53,541 --> 02:17:56,374
their traditions, and their beliefs are
inferior and ours are commendable.

1533
02:17:57,708 --> 02:17:58,749
It's wrong.

1534
02:18:00,750 --> 02:18:02,957
But I have heard, son,

1535
02:18:03,166 --> 02:18:09,082
that there, they discriminate
against members of certain ethnicities.

1536
02:18:09,291 --> 02:18:12,415
Look, sometimes there are clashes.
Where are there not?

1537
02:18:12,666 --> 02:18:17,040
But the important part is this:
We also create rifts - based on caste.

1538
02:18:19,833 --> 02:18:27,624
You talk as if we have created the
caste, class, religious and social systems.

1539
02:18:28,333 --> 02:18:32,124
This hierarchy of caste is
ancient, as is culture and religion.

1540
02:18:33,166 --> 02:18:35,582
And color and creed.

1541
02:18:35,916 --> 02:18:39,999
And listen, one's caste is
a thing that can never die!

1542
02:18:40,583 --> 02:18:43,040
Just because a custom is
ancient does not mean it is right.

1543
02:18:45,083 --> 02:18:49,332
Why are you imposing your
views on us, Mohan babu?

1544
02:18:50,708 --> 02:18:52,332
I'm not imposing any views.

1545
02:18:53,166 --> 02:18:56,999
I am only expressing myself, speaking of
things I've noticed while living here.

1546
02:18:58,333 --> 02:19:00,957
I've realized that we keep
fighting amongst ourselves...

1547
02:19:01,166 --> 02:19:06,207
...when we should be fighting against
illiteracy, overpopulation, and corruption.

1548
02:19:06,333 --> 02:19:11,374
Every day, in our streets and homes,
every one of us keeps saying that...

1549
02:19:11,405 --> 02:19:15,749
...that this country has gone to the dogs.
That this country is on the path to destruction.

1550
02:19:16,583 --> 02:19:20,624
And if we keep saying just this,
we will actually end up there one day.

1551
02:19:20,916 --> 02:19:22,665
You'll need to do something to stop this.

1552
02:19:22,875 --> 02:19:24,249
You too.

1553
02:19:24,416 --> 02:19:26,874
Not just the members of the
panchayat, but everyone in the village.

1554
02:19:28,875 --> 02:19:32,249
You are blaming the members of 
the panchayat for your problems.

1555
02:19:32,458 --> 02:19:37,415
But if you stepped into their shoes, you'd
do the same thing. This applies to me, too.

1556
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:40,207
The dalits blame the brahmins,

1557
02:19:40,416 --> 02:19:44,332
and brahmins claim that their
piety is spoiled by the dalits.

1558
02:19:45,250 --> 02:19:48,374
The blacksmith and potter blame the moneylender.

1559
02:19:49,708 --> 02:19:53,332
The landowners blame the tenants,
but they don't give them their rights.

1560
02:19:54,625 --> 02:19:57,040
In what way are we great, then?

1561
02:19:58,500 --> 02:20:00,790
If we have problems in the village,
we point our finger at the state...

1562
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:05,832
...and the state at someone else.
We all are finding fault with each other!

1563
02:20:06,375 --> 02:20:09,665
The fact is that we're all to be blamed.

1564
02:20:10,916 --> 02:20:13,249
Because the problem... is us.

1565
02:20:13,666 --> 02:20:15,499
Me... you...

1566
02:20:16,958 --> 02:20:17,832
...all of us.

1567
02:20:19,250 --> 02:20:22,999
Have you lost your head?
What are you saying?

1568
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:25,624
All I know is that...

1569
02:20:26,916 --> 02:20:31,040
...a weaver who changed his
occupation by becoming a farmer...

1570
02:20:32,583 --> 02:20:35,207
...cannot feed his family...

1571
02:20:38,083 --> 02:20:40,165
...or give his children an education.

1572
02:20:41,750 --> 02:20:44,707
He can only watch them die of starvation.

1573
02:21:33,750 --> 02:21:39,999
Every moment weighs terribly,
we're struck by a calamity

1574
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:47,332
Save me, oh king of the Raghu race

1575
02:21:48,416 --> 02:21:52,957
Come, oh hero of the Raghu race;
Lord Ram, please come!

1576
02:21:53,166 --> 02:21:57,874
Lord of my heart,
my Sriram, please come!

1577
02:21:58,083 --> 02:22:02,624
I keep repeating the name of the Lord,
hear it and come

1578
02:22:02,833 --> 02:22:05,290
I chant your name;

1579
02:22:05,541 --> 02:22:09,332
please listen, Ram!

1580
02:22:09,541 --> 02:22:11,540
Let the truth ring out loud

1581
02:22:11,958 --> 02:22:13,749
Burn Lanka of its sins

1582
02:22:14,333 --> 02:22:19,207
Come at once and liberate me;
listen to my woes

1583
02:22:19,375 --> 02:22:25,624
Every moment weighs terribly,
we're struck by a calamity

1584
02:22:26,541 --> 02:22:33,165
Save me, oh king of the Raghu race

1585
02:22:43,333 --> 02:22:47,249
Forget Ram, look!
Raavan has come

1586
02:22:47,833 --> 02:22:52,040
His mighty shadow is found in all creation

1587
02:22:52,708 --> 02:22:58,082
Why do you chant the name of Ram?
Why do you take the name of Ram?

1588
02:22:58,916 --> 02:23:03,082
This "Ram, Ram" you've started...

1589
02:23:03,375 --> 02:23:05,332
Sita!

1590
02:23:05,583 --> 02:23:08,999
What have you found so worthy in Ram?

1591
02:23:09,750 --> 02:23:13,749
How can one count all his virtues?

1592
02:23:13,958 --> 02:23:18,624
Where are there so many words?

1593
02:23:19,375 --> 02:23:23,332
Who can reach the summits

1594
02:23:23,541 --> 02:23:28,332
where my Ram sits?

1595
02:23:28,958 --> 02:23:33,499
In the whole world, 
he is the highest being, the supreme spirit

1596
02:23:33,708 --> 02:23:38,082
Stronger than all and yet patient

1597
02:23:38,291 --> 02:23:42,499
But now his patience has reached its limit

1598
02:23:42,708 --> 02:23:47,249
Raavan, there's still time - ask for forgiveness!

1599
02:23:47,791 --> 02:23:49,749
Let the truth ring out loud

1600
02:23:50,333 --> 02:23:52,082
Burn Lanka of sins

1601
02:23:52,625 --> 02:23:54,832
When King Ram arrives, we will bow down to him;

1602
02:23:55,041 --> 02:23:57,582
with him will come his devoted brother, Lakshman!

1603
02:23:57,791 --> 02:24:03,790
Every moment weighs terribly,
we're struck by a calamity

1604
02:24:04,958 --> 02:24:14,457
Save me, oh king of the Raghu race

1605
02:24:18,708 --> 02:24:22,707
If Ram holds strength,
if Ram possesses courage,

1606
02:24:22,916 --> 02:24:26,957
why has he not come yet to protect you?

1607
02:24:27,166 --> 02:24:31,207
He whose descriptions
you never tire of giving -

1608
02:24:31,375 --> 02:24:35,665
tell me, where is your 
Ram at this very minute?

1609
02:24:52,333 --> 02:24:56,332
Ram is in my every heartbeat

1610
02:24:56,541 --> 02:25:01,957
Ram is in my soul, Ram is in my life itself

1611
02:25:02,791 --> 02:25:06,749
Ram is in every moment of mine, 
Ram is in my every breath

1612
02:25:06,958 --> 02:25:11,624
Ram is in every hope of mine; Ram is what I long for

1613
02:25:15,375 --> 02:25:19,499
Ram is in compassion, Ram is in peace

1614
02:25:19,708 --> 02:25:24,040
Ram is in unity, Ram is in progress

1615
02:25:25,833 --> 02:25:29,915
Ram lives in the minds of 
followers and enemies alike

1616
02:25:30,125 --> 02:25:34,165
Forsake sin, Raavan, Ram is in your heart

1617
02:25:34,333 --> 02:25:42,499
Ram in your heart, Ram is in my heart

1618
02:25:42,708 --> 02:25:46,665
Ram is in every home, Ram is in every courtyard

1619
02:25:46,875 --> 02:26:02,332
Whoever removes Raavan from
their heart will find Ram there

1620
02:26:12,791 --> 02:26:19,040
Every moment weighs terribly,
we're struck by a calamity

1621
02:26:20,083 --> 02:26:27,415
Save me, oh king of the Raghu race

1622
02:26:36,166 --> 02:26:41,207
Listen, Ram is coming
My Ram is coming

1623
02:26:41,375 --> 02:26:45,957
King Ramchandra is coming;
Lord Ramchandra is coming

1624
02:26:46,166 --> 02:26:50,624
Look Lord Ram has come,
Mine Lord Ram has come

1625
02:26:50,833 --> 02:27:04,749
Ram is coming, my Ram is coming

1626
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:11,665
Siyavar Ramchandra Ki... Jai!
(Glory to Lord Ramchandra)

1627
02:28:30,708 --> 02:28:33,165
The burning Raavan is looking
prettier in the darkness.

1628
02:28:55,333 --> 02:29:13,540
Every moment weighs terribly, we're struck by a calamity!
Save me, oh king of the Raghu race!

1629
02:29:13,750 --> 02:29:16,290
Listen. Quiet! Be quiet, please. Please.

1630
02:29:18,291 --> 02:29:19,624
Why is it I feel...

1631
02:29:20,625 --> 02:29:23,374
...that you all have started
to enjoy living in this darkness?

1632
02:29:24,250 --> 02:29:25,874
You've adjusted to it, no?

1633
02:29:27,416 --> 02:29:32,332
For how long are you going to
take your problems lying down?

1634
02:29:34,583 --> 02:29:36,915
But what else can we do, Mohan ji?

1635
02:29:37,875 --> 02:29:39,957
Will you do as I ask?

1636
02:29:40,583 --> 02:29:44,082
Have you once again come up
with some strange solution?

1637
02:29:44,458 --> 02:29:46,249
Please, have mercy on us, bhai!

1638
02:29:48,375 --> 02:29:49,582
Wait, Munishwar.

1639
02:29:50,750 --> 02:29:51,957
What do you want us to do?

1640
02:29:52,875 --> 02:29:54,665
There's a spring on
that nearby mountain, right?

1641
02:29:55,250 --> 02:29:57,040
Yes, there is. So?

1642
02:29:57,583 --> 02:29:59,082
So I need a hundred men.

1643
02:29:59,958 --> 02:30:01,165
A hundred men?

1644
02:30:02,291 --> 02:30:03,332
You will have them.

1645
02:30:04,833 --> 02:30:06,874
You will have a hundred men.

1646
02:30:07,791 --> 02:30:08,874
Thank you, Dada ji.

1647
02:30:12,791 --> 02:30:15,582
Sir, one hears lightning struck
this spot several years ago.

1648
02:30:15,791 --> 02:30:17,582
Since then, there has
been this gush of water.

1649
02:30:43,208 --> 02:30:45,124
I wonder what he's up to!

1650
02:30:48,833 --> 02:30:53,624
Look at this. This is point A1.

1651
02:30:56,916 --> 02:30:59,499
We'll build a reservoir here.

1652
02:31:00,375 --> 02:31:02,332
I mean, a water tank.

1653
02:31:02,583 --> 02:31:04,624
The water will accumulate here.

1654
02:31:05,458 --> 02:31:09,207
From here, there will be a 
pipe that leads to point A3.

1655
02:31:10,500 --> 02:31:15,374
A3 will have a shed with a 
turbine - I mean, machine.

1656
02:31:15,833 --> 02:31:19,832
When the pipe's water falls on the
turbine, it will rotate with great speed.

1657
02:31:20,291 --> 02:31:24,624
And if everything goes well,
electricity will be generated.

1658
02:31:30,916 --> 02:31:32,040
We'll form four groups.

1659
02:31:32,208 --> 02:31:35,249
The blacksmiths will cast the molds for the pipes.

1660
02:31:35,458 --> 02:31:39,165
The second and third groups will do
the digging work for the tank and so on.

1661
02:31:39,375 --> 02:31:42,124
Now, let's form the groups.

1662
02:31:42,416 --> 02:31:43,249
Fast!

1663
02:31:44,083 --> 02:31:47,374
This boy looks promising!

1664
02:31:47,833 --> 02:31:49,124
Surely seems like it.

1665
02:31:49,958 --> 02:31:54,082
The reservoir will be made here.
Five meters long and one meter wide.

1666
02:31:54,250 --> 02:31:55,749
I mean, five arms' lengths by one arm's length.

1667
02:31:55,958 --> 02:31:58,624
For this, we will have to clear
out all the stones and bushes.

1668
02:31:58,833 --> 02:32:00,790
Is that clear?
-Yes.

1669
02:32:13,875 --> 02:32:16,832
It's seven feet and six inches.

1670
02:32:53,833 --> 02:32:54,749
May I try it?

1671
02:33:21,916 --> 02:33:22,832
Where's Mela Ram?

1672
02:33:25,958 --> 02:33:29,415
What is this?
- From boot to suit - total American, sir!

1673
02:33:31,875 --> 02:33:33,165
But why?

1674
02:33:33,375 --> 02:33:34,999
Now that we are going 
to do business together,

1675
02:33:35,166 --> 02:33:37,290
I thought that I should 
look like a 40% partner!

1676
02:33:40,500 --> 02:33:43,332
This is my passport and this is
my VISA form, fully filled out!

1677
02:33:43,583 --> 02:33:45,332
Once it's stamped...

1678
02:33:59,458 --> 02:34:01,540
Baloo, show him an
alternator powered 24 watts.

1679
02:34:01,750 --> 02:34:03,332
Please come in, sir.

1680
02:34:34,125 --> 02:34:37,832
Here's your water, Dada ji.
- Thank you, Santaram.

1681
02:34:38,500 --> 02:34:41,040
How's work progressing on the hill?

1682
02:34:41,125 --> 02:34:42,249
It's going well.

1683
02:34:42,500 --> 02:34:45,332
How long will it take?
- It will be completed very soon.

1684
02:34:45,583 --> 02:34:46,832
You take a rest.

1685
02:34:51,125 --> 02:34:54,749
I'll leave you now.
Jai Ram ji ki.

1686
02:35:06,875 --> 02:35:10,499
By the way, Vinod, will the turbine
principle work in power generation?

1687
02:35:11,333 --> 02:35:13,665
Yeah. Why do you ask?

1688
02:35:13,875 --> 02:35:17,540
You know what? I am trying
to generate electricity here.

1689
02:35:18,041 --> 02:35:20,415
Electricity? What the hell
are you talking about?

1690
02:35:21,666 --> 02:35:24,124
No, no, Vinod. I'm lighting a bulb here.

1691
02:35:25,541 --> 02:35:27,957
John is beginning to lose it by the day.

1692
02:35:28,125 --> 02:35:29,957
Speak to John, and
buy me some more time.

1693
02:35:30,125 --> 02:35:32,957
We've started working nights.
- Come on, Vinod - handle it for me!

1694
02:35:33,125 --> 02:35:34,540
I'll talk to you later. Okay?

1695
02:35:34,750 --> 02:35:35,749
Bye.
- Bye.

1696
02:35:46,333 --> 02:35:54,207
25 into 75 is equal to...
- 1875.

1697
02:36:04,750 --> 02:36:09,415
23.3 into 33.9.

1698
02:36:15,541 --> 02:36:19,540
789.87... 790.

1699
02:36:48,541 --> 02:36:51,957
Yeah, just a moment...
I'm about to finish this.

1700
02:37:06,041 --> 02:37:07,624
I've fallen in love with you.

1701
02:37:19,458 --> 02:37:22,624
What did you say? Come again.

1702
02:37:35,541 --> 02:37:39,332
See! Just see!

1703
02:37:39,666 --> 02:37:44,874
It's you and me, and long solitude!

1704
02:37:45,125 --> 02:37:49,332
See! Just see!

1705
02:37:49,541 --> 02:37:54,749
How delicate these shadows are!

1706
02:37:55,083 --> 02:37:59,540
Listen, just listen! Listen to the heartbeats

1707
02:37:59,833 --> 02:38:04,290
Listen, just listen! Listen to the song of silence

1708
02:38:04,666 --> 02:38:14,082
Listen, just listen! Listen to what the night says!

1709
02:38:14,208 --> 02:38:16,540
Night's come

1710
02:38:16,750 --> 02:38:18,874
with desires nameless and many

1711
02:38:19,125 --> 02:38:23,665
She tells so many stories - I listen

1712
02:38:23,875 --> 02:38:28,332
Night is stretching her limbs
Some unusual words are said;

1713
02:38:28,541 --> 02:38:33,124
like strewn pearls, I pick them up

1714
02:38:35,541 --> 02:38:39,540
What you just said

1715
02:38:39,750 --> 02:38:44,374
has made my eyes light up with flames

1716
02:38:45,125 --> 02:38:48,832
What you just said

1717
02:38:49,041 --> 02:38:54,249
has taken away the darkness from my nights

1718
02:38:59,250 --> 02:39:01,957
Mela Ram, ready?
- Ready, sir!

1719
02:39:02,125 --> 02:39:03,457
Release the valve!

1720
02:39:10,125 --> 02:39:11,540
Release the value further!

1721
02:39:17,333 --> 02:39:18,290
Good!

1722
02:39:48,166 --> 02:39:50,957
The water will gush to this
turbine through this pipe.

1723
02:39:51,125 --> 02:39:53,207
The turbine will rotate with the force of water.

1724
02:39:54,250 --> 02:39:57,665
With this steering wheel,
we can control the water flow.

1725
02:39:58,250 --> 02:40:01,124
We need to release enough water
to make this pulley rotate,

1726
02:40:01,333 --> 02:40:06,957
and make this alternator spin
at the speed of 1,500 RPM.

1727
02:40:08,125 --> 02:40:10,540
And if this happens,
electricity will be generated.

1728
02:40:13,958 --> 02:40:17,124
Without you, the days and nights were lonely

1729
02:40:17,333 --> 02:40:21,874
Life was overcast with desolation

1730
02:40:23,458 --> 02:40:26,957
Now the days shine and the nights are sweet

1731
02:40:27,125 --> 02:40:31,749
for you are my companion

1732
02:40:33,416 --> 02:40:42,749
Without you I was incomplete; now I am whole

1733
02:40:43,375 --> 02:40:52,540
In you, I discovered my world,
yet I have lost myself

1734
02:40:52,750 --> 02:40:57,290
Now we both realize what living is all about

1735
02:40:57,541 --> 02:41:01,499
What life was like and what it's like now

1736
02:41:02,125 --> 02:41:06,749
Now we both realize how wonderful the world is

1737
02:41:11,875 --> 02:41:16,749
We have so much happiness

1738
02:41:46,458 --> 02:41:47,624
What are you all doing?

1739
02:41:49,458 --> 02:41:53,332
There will be electricity in
your house, Dadi Setu!

1740
02:42:00,541 --> 02:42:04,832
The wires are up. 
Now, all that we have to do is wait.

1741
02:42:06,250 --> 02:42:09,707
Ready?
- Ready, sir!

1742
02:42:15,833 --> 02:42:16,624
Nivaaran ji, okay?

1743
02:42:16,833 --> 02:42:17,540
Yes, Mohan babu.

1744
02:42:18,291 --> 02:42:21,249
Mela Ram, release the water!
- Okay, sir!

1745
02:42:28,750 --> 02:42:29,624
Nivaaran ji?

1746
02:42:30,541 --> 02:42:34,040
Open the valve... slowly.

1747
02:43:13,708 --> 02:43:15,249
Electricity will be generated at 230 volts.

1748
02:43:55,625 --> 02:43:57,124
Come on...

1749
02:44:17,166 --> 02:44:20,040
Nivaaran ji. The valve is fully open, right?
- Yes, Mohan babu.

1750
02:44:26,125 --> 02:44:29,540
Mela Ram! Is the valve fully open?

1751
02:44:30,958 --> 02:44:33,832
Fully open, sir! Totally open!

1752
02:44:34,041 --> 02:44:35,749
Sure?
- Sure!

1753
02:44:40,833 --> 02:44:43,624
Gita, come here.
Hold this state.

1754
02:44:44,833 --> 02:44:45,624
Hold it.

1755
02:45:05,833 --> 02:45:07,415
If the valve is fully open,
how come there's no pressure?

1756
02:46:00,958 --> 02:46:02,374
Has the pressure increased?

1757
02:46:02,625 --> 02:46:03,249
Yes!

1758
02:46:29,041 --> 02:46:31,124
Jafar bhai, how many RPM?

1759
02:46:35,125 --> 02:46:36,124
800, sir.

1760
02:47:08,250 --> 02:47:10,707
I say, how long now for the electricity?

1761
02:47:11,041 --> 02:47:13,415
Have patience, Munishwar - patience.

1762
02:47:51,458 --> 02:47:52,415
Electricity.

1763
02:48:09,250 --> 02:48:10,249
Electricity.

1764
02:48:38,708 --> 02:48:41,374
Bhai Mohan ji, we have done it!

1765
02:48:41,833 --> 02:48:45,374
Electricity for our own village.
Generated with our toil and sweat.

1766
02:48:46,041 --> 02:48:49,957
Just like this project, we must
think of newer, innovative ways...

1767
02:48:50,166 --> 02:48:51,624
...to solve our village's problems.

1768
02:48:51,833 --> 02:48:59,832
Sarpanch ji, come quickly!
Dada ji's health has deteriorated.

1769
02:49:14,708 --> 02:49:15,582
Dada ji...

1770
02:49:19,625 --> 02:49:23,999
Electricity? Is it here?

1771
02:49:24,208 --> 02:49:24,957
Yes.

1772
02:49:31,250 --> 02:49:32,249
The day...

1773
02:49:33,250 --> 02:49:34,415
...I saw you...

1774
02:49:36,125 --> 02:49:37,124
...I felt...

1775
02:49:39,041 --> 02:49:42,832
...something special about you.

1776
02:49:51,458 --> 02:49:53,040
Now that you're here...

1777
02:49:55,375 --> 02:49:56,124
...I can...

1778
02:49:57,958 --> 02:50:01,332
...die in peace.

1779
02:51:13,041 --> 02:51:16,415
But Mohan, you've already been away
for five weeks. This really isn't right.

1780
02:51:17,041 --> 02:51:20,832
I'm extremely sorry, John. I've just been
caught up with some personal work and...

1781
02:51:21,041 --> 02:51:26,040
We are in Phase II of core design here.
There can't be any further delays.

1782
02:51:26,250 --> 02:51:29,832
I understand, John. I've just finished
with what I needed to do here, and...

1783
02:51:31,166 --> 02:51:32,624
...and I'll be back in three days.

1784
02:51:33,458 --> 02:51:37,540
Three days it is.
- Of course, John. Yes... I will.

1785
02:52:00,833 --> 02:52:04,165
What surprises me is how
you can think of going...

1786
02:52:04,375 --> 02:52:06,957
...after all that you have seen and learnt here.

1787
02:52:07,958 --> 02:52:08,957
It's true, Gita.

1788
02:52:09,958 --> 02:52:12,415
I have learnt so much here, gained so much here.

1789
02:52:13,375 --> 02:52:14,832
Felt the problems here...

1790
02:52:16,958 --> 02:52:18,374
...but I cannot live here.

1791
02:52:19,833 --> 02:52:21,707
And I cannot live elsewhere.

1792
02:52:25,041 --> 02:52:26,749
I want to marry you...

1793
02:52:28,250 --> 02:52:29,832
...but I won't go to America.

1794
02:52:52,250 --> 02:52:54,500
You're not going to come with me. Right?

1795
02:52:56,041 --> 02:52:57,749
Mohan, I've given it lot of thought.

1796
02:52:57,958 --> 02:53:06,707
At this age, I wouldn't be able to adopt
the ways and customs of another place.

1797
02:53:08,041 --> 02:53:11,415
I am happy here.

1798
02:53:14,250 --> 02:53:15,832
Now that you are leaving...

1799
02:53:20,041 --> 02:53:28,832
...I will miss you very much.

1800
02:53:32,125 --> 02:53:35,832
If you stayed here, our family
would have been complete.

1801
02:54:07,250 --> 02:54:08,124
Goodbye.

1802
02:54:08,708 --> 02:54:09,624
Live long.

1803
02:54:11,000 --> 02:54:15,165
Mohan ji,
we had forgotten that you were a guest.

1804
02:54:16,041 --> 02:54:18,749
A visitor must leave one day.

1805
02:54:26,458 --> 02:54:28,332
We'll miss you very much, Mohan babu.

1806
02:54:31,833 --> 02:54:33,124
When you come back, bhai,

1807
02:54:33,833 --> 02:54:38,040
you'll be sure to find Internet
in the Charanpur Post Office.

1808
02:54:38,250 --> 02:54:40,249
Every kid will e-mail you!

1809
02:54:41,458 --> 02:54:44,249
We just need to have our wrestling match.

1810
02:54:49,833 --> 02:54:53,624
I am sorry, Mela Ram, that
I have to leave suddenly.

1811
02:54:53,916 --> 02:54:57,249
But I'll definitely send you
the sponsorship papers.

1812
02:54:57,500 --> 02:55:01,124
No, sir.
I don't need them anymore. I'm fine here.

1813
02:55:03,041 --> 02:55:07,040
Mohan babu, your presence in the
village has changed things around here.

1814
02:55:07,250 --> 02:55:08,957
Some things have clearly changed. 

1815
02:55:09,600 --> 02:55:12,040
But... have you forgotten about
your plan to immigrate to America?

1816
02:55:14,041 --> 02:55:17,040
When the vine crawling along your
wall crosses onto another's property,

1817
02:55:17,250 --> 02:55:18,624
individual homes are lost.

1818
02:55:19,375 --> 02:55:25,415
It's like a lamp on your porch,
giving light to neighbor's house.

1819
02:55:26,541 --> 02:55:27,624
All the best, sir.

1820
02:55:29,541 --> 02:55:30,624
Thank you, Mela Ram.

1821
02:55:44,041 --> 02:55:46,582
Mohan bhaiyya, this is for you.

1822
02:55:54,958 --> 02:55:56,332
I will put this up in my house.

1823
02:55:57,101 --> 02:56:00,124
Look, study hard. Right?

1824
02:56:21,458 --> 02:56:22,415
Where is Gita?

1825
02:56:23,041 --> 02:56:25,415
I haven't seen her around since morning.

1826
02:56:28,250 --> 02:56:29,415
I have to leave now...

1827
02:56:30,041 --> 02:56:32,624
...or else I'll miss my flight.
- Okay.

1828
02:56:33,541 --> 02:56:34,624
Please explain to her.

1829
02:56:38,625 --> 02:56:46,707
Go, son. My love and
blessings are always with you.

1830
02:56:53,250 --> 02:56:56,124
Don't worry.

1831
02:57:04,041 --> 02:57:05,457
Bye, Mohan bhaiyya.

1832
02:58:00,625 --> 02:58:01,832
You're impossible, Gita.

1833
02:58:02,541 --> 02:58:03,624
You're here, and I...

1834
02:58:05,041 --> 02:58:07,040
...I've been looking for you all over.

1835
02:58:09,125 --> 02:58:11,707
I did not want to talk to
you in front of everyone else.

1836
02:58:14,041 --> 02:58:15,915
I'm upset with your decision,

1837
02:58:17,958 --> 02:58:20,165
but I can understand your predicament.

1838
02:58:21,541 --> 02:58:22,832
I can understand.

1839
02:58:25,625 --> 02:58:28,540
Gita, I can understand how you feel, too...

1840
02:58:30,541 --> 02:58:34,332
...but please don't mistake
my helplessness for betrayal.

1841
02:58:35,541 --> 02:58:38,249
I did not mean to hurt you...
- Mohan.

1842
02:58:40,041 --> 02:58:41,374
I love you.

1843
02:58:42,958 --> 02:58:45,832
I want you to be happy wherever you are.

1844
02:58:49,250 --> 02:58:50,415
This is for you.

1845
02:58:54,750 --> 02:58:55,832
What is this?

1846
02:58:56,375 --> 02:58:57,124
Open it.

1847
02:59:06,541 --> 02:59:07,540
What's all this?

1848
02:59:10,458 --> 02:59:12,540
A collection of our culture and traditions.

1849
02:59:14,041 --> 02:59:16,124
Little flowers of our faith.

1850
02:59:18,333 --> 02:59:19,415
Our fields...

1851
02:59:20,250 --> 02:59:21,624
...greenery...

1852
02:59:22,250 --> 02:59:23,040
...rivers...

1853
02:59:24,041 --> 02:59:25,582
...our customs.

1854
02:59:30,250 --> 02:59:32,707
All these will keep reminding you of us.

1855
02:59:34,250 --> 02:59:35,290
And maybe...

1856
02:59:37,333 --> 02:59:39,957
...maybe persuade you to return.

1857
03:00:54,541 --> 03:00:56,415
Don't go. Please, don't go.

1858
03:01:58,375 --> 03:02:04,582
And as we can see, we have some
points here that the satellite travels...

1859
03:02:04,791 --> 03:02:09,332
...along the way to capture
data of the Global Precipitation.

1860
03:02:09,583 --> 03:02:13,415
Next we're going to see the
trajectory of the GPM instrument,

1861
03:02:13,791 --> 03:02:20,207
as it goes from Australia...
India... and the United States.

1862
03:03:18,358 --> 03:03:21,790
This land of yours

1863
03:03:22,275 --> 03:03:25,720
is your motherland

1864
03:03:26,175 --> 03:03:31,690
She calls out to you

1865
03:03:33,800 --> 03:03:39,482
This is a bond that can never be broken

1866
03:03:47,300 --> 03:03:50,957
The scent of the soil:

1867
03:03:51,100 --> 03:03:54,774
How can you forget it?

1868
03:03:54,950 --> 03:04:02,400
No matter where you wander,
you'll always come back

1869
03:04:02,500 --> 03:04:06,500
In new paths,

1870
03:04:06,500 --> 03:04:13,857
in every sigh,
to your lost heart

1871
03:04:14,175 --> 03:04:16,000
someone will say:

1872
03:04:16,000 --> 03:04:17,000
someone will say:

1873
03:04:17,000 --> 03:04:20,415
"This land of yours

1874
03:04:21,166 --> 03:04:24,374
is your motherland

1875
03:04:25,083 --> 03:04:29,790
She calls out to you

1876
03:04:29,958 --> 03:04:35,415
This is a bond that
can never be broken"

1877
03:04:58,291 --> 03:05:01,790
Life itself

1878
03:05:02,166 --> 03:05:05,582
is telling you, traveler:

1879
03:05:06,041 --> 03:05:09,332
"You have accomplished everything;

1880
03:05:09,875 --> 03:05:13,165
what's left now?"

1881
03:05:13,708 --> 03:05:16,957
Happiness has been showered upon you

1882
03:05:17,166 --> 03:05:20,582
but you're far from your home

1883
03:05:20,958 --> 03:05:24,790
Come back now, fool,

1884
03:05:24,958 --> 03:05:28,957
to where someone would
consider you their own

1885
03:05:29,166 --> 03:05:36,165
and call out to you!
This country...

1886
03:05:36,375 --> 03:05:39,165
this land of yours

1887
03:05:40,166 --> 03:05:43,582
is your motherland

1888
03:05:44,083 --> 03:05:48,780
She calls out to you!

1889
03:05:48,780 --> 03:05:54,582
This is a bond that can never be broken

1890
03:05:54,750 --> 03:06:01,200
Now that you're here...
I can... die in peace.

1891
03:06:01,483 --> 03:06:05,620
It's like a lamp on your porch,
giving light to neighbor's house.

1892
03:06:06,958 --> 03:06:10,165
I've made up my mind, Vinod.
I must go back.

1893
03:06:11,958 --> 03:06:12,957
Not again.

1894
03:06:13,791 --> 03:06:17,582
How can you go all the way back for the girl?
Just persuade her to come here.

1895
03:06:17,791 --> 03:06:18,874
It's not like that, Vinod.

1896
03:06:19,375 --> 03:06:21,415
It's not only about Gita and Kaveriamma.

1897
03:06:24,800 --> 03:06:28,380
This moment

1898
03:06:28,680 --> 03:06:31,874
conceals within it

1899
03:06:32,691 --> 03:06:35,774
a whole century

1900
03:06:36,401 --> 03:06:39,700
of life

1901
03:06:39,900 --> 03:06:47,582
Don't you dare ask why the road
forks into two diverging paths

1902
03:06:47,691 --> 03:06:58,220
You are the one to choose which path,
you are the one to choose which direction you take

1903
03:06:58,220 --> 03:07:02,957
This land

1904
03:07:03,000 --> 03:07:05,957
This land of yours

1905
03:07:06,900 --> 03:07:10,790
is your motherland!

1906
03:07:11,958 --> 03:07:17,332
She calls out to you!

1907
03:07:17,583 --> 03:07:23,165
This is a bond that can never be broken

1908
03:07:23,375 --> 03:07:24,332
I understand.

1909
03:07:26,583 --> 03:07:27,582
Just because you lit a bulb,

1910
03:07:27,791 --> 03:07:29,874
you now have delusions of sparking
a revolution throughout the country.

1911
03:07:34,958 --> 03:07:36,582
You're being foolishly romantic!

1912
03:07:40,375 --> 03:07:41,790
Let's leave aside sentiments.

1913
03:07:42,166 --> 03:07:43,957
Have you figured out what 
you are going to do there?

1914
03:07:45,791 --> 03:07:47,457
I have a few ideas.
- Like?

1915
03:07:49,375 --> 03:07:54,165
I could be a Project Manager for
Vikram Sarabhai Space Center.

1916
03:07:54,791 --> 03:07:56,957
I can... I can work in 
tandem with NASA from there.

1917
03:07:57,958 --> 03:07:59,374
There's a lot to be done there.

1918
03:07:59,958 --> 03:08:02,957
You're impossible!
I can't understand you.

1919
03:08:04,958 --> 03:08:07,249
If you can't understand 
after hearing all this, then...

1920
03:08:09,166 --> 03:08:10,415
...then maybe it's pointless
explaining anything to you.

1921
03:08:12,708 --> 03:08:14,499
You'll have to go there 
and see things for yourself.

1922
03:08:16,458 --> 03:08:18,290
Otherwise, you'll never understand.

1923
03:08:39,166 --> 03:08:44,165
We're just a few minutes away now
from the launch of the GPM spacecraft,

1924
03:08:44,583 --> 03:08:45,957
on an important scientific mission to...

1925
03:08:46,166 --> 03:08:48,957
...better understand the
global water cycle here on earth.

1926
03:08:51,583 --> 03:08:55,790
GPM will allow improvements in
predicting precipitation forecasts,

1927
03:08:55,958 --> 03:08:58,040
and better predict flood hazards.

1928
03:08:58,500 --> 03:09:02,165
We are not tracking any
technical problems at this time.

1929
03:09:02,375 --> 03:09:05,790
All systems are "go" on the launch vehicle.

1930
03:09:05,958 --> 03:09:08,415
Weather forecast is very good for today.

1931
03:09:10,166 --> 03:09:14,582
Just a few minutes away from
launching the GPM spacecraft.

1932
03:09:14,791 --> 03:09:17,957
This spacecraft will be
able to give us information...

1933
03:09:18,166 --> 03:09:22,200
...that will help us better predict precipitation.
It also will help us in understanding the...

1934
03:09:22,200 --> 03:09:29,165
...global water cycles and fresh water availability.
In addition, we can better predict flood hazards.

1935
03:09:30,416 --> 03:09:32,582
T minus 20 seconds.

1936
03:09:46,375 --> 03:09:48,582
T minus 15 seconds.

1937
03:09:51,791 --> 03:09:58,165
T minus 10... 9... 8... 7... 6...

1938
03:09:58,375 --> 03:10:01,165
We have a "go" for main engine start.

1939
03:10:01,958 --> 03:10:06,165
3... 2... booster ignition...

1940
03:10:08,708 --> 03:10:10,582
...and liftoff!

1941
03:11:01,375 --> 03:11:03,332
John, I tried to knock
some sense into his head.

1942
03:11:03,583 --> 03:11:05,582
I tried to convince
him not to leave, but...

1943
03:11:08,958 --> 03:11:11,707
Mohan, you do realize
what you are going to lose.

1944
03:11:12,291 --> 03:11:15,790
John, I know what I'm going to gain.

1945
03:11:16,958 --> 03:11:20,290
But you're aware you
could have gone places.

1946
03:11:22,583 --> 03:11:24,165
I am going places.

1947
03:11:28,958 --> 03:11:32,582
All right, Mohan. 
Go light your bulb.

1948
03:12:31,708 --> 03:12:33,874
Nobody has ever thrown me like this.

1949
03:12:34,375 --> 03:12:36,332
Where did you learn those
wrestling tricks, Mohan babu?

1950
03:12:36,791 --> 03:12:39,165
Where there is a will, there is a way.

1951
03:12:40,291 --> 03:12:43,415
After all, a coward changes his attitude
in the company of another coward.

1952
03:12:44,583 --> 03:12:45,582
Do you understand now?

1953
03:12:51,375 --> 03:12:53,165
Excellent match, Mohan babu!

1954
