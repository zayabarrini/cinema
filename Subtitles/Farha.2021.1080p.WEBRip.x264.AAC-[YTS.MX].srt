INSPIRED BY TRUE EVENTS

4
00:01:05,953 --> 00:01:08,202
Oh fig Pickers

5
00:01:08,227 --> 00:01:10,461
Oh fig Pickers

6
00:01:10,486 --> 00:01:12,819
Leave the best fig for your beloved

7
00:01:12,844 --> 00:01:15,000
Leave the best fig for your beloved

8
00:01:15,391 --> 00:01:19,437
And he who eats but doesn't pick And he
who eats but doesn't pick

9
00:01:19,462 --> 00:01:21,432
Throw the lot over his head

10
00:01:21,457 --> 00:01:23,601
Throw the lot over his head

11
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,234
We are late. The Sheikh will be upset!
Help me up.

12
00:01:35,789 --> 00:01:36,992
Farha!

13
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,109
- Come on!
- Hurry.

14
00:01:49,547 --> 00:01:51,148
Farha, come on

15
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,703
FARHA

16
00:02:31,007 --> 00:02:35,827
IN PALESTINE, 1948

17
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:42,867
''If you do not aid him,
Allah has already aided him

18
00:02:42,946 --> 00:02:47,476
when the unbelievers had driven him out as
one of two when they were in the cave.''

19
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:50,430
''And he said to his companion: 'Do not
grieve...'''

20
00:02:50,469 --> 00:02:57,234
''And he said to his companion: 'Do not
grieve. Indeed, Allah is with us.'''

21
00:02:57,929 --> 00:03:00,734
''And Allah sent down his tranquility
upon him...

22
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:03,142
and supported him with angels you
did not see and made the unbelievers...''

23
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:04,846
''And made the word...''

24
00:03:04,871 --> 00:03:11,375
''And made the word of the
unbelievers...''

25
00:03:13,766 --> 00:03:15,476
''The lowest.''

26
00:03:15,501 --> 00:03:20,461
''the lowest, while the word of Allah is
the highest.''

27
00:03:20,539 --> 00:03:25,016
''And Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise.''
To God Almighty has spoken the truth.

28
00:03:25,961 --> 00:03:28,523
Today, I will dismiss you earlier, girls.

29
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:32,812
As you know, tomorrow is Suad's
Henna Night.

30
00:03:34,578 --> 00:03:36,828
I hope to officiate all your weddings
soon.

31
00:03:36,853 --> 00:03:41,023
Or better to hope that we have a
school in the village, just like the boys.

32
00:03:42,649 --> 00:03:44,516
You may all go now.

33
00:03:54,899 --> 00:03:56,726
- How are you, dear?
- Good.

34
00:03:57,485 --> 00:04:00,500
Pass my greetings to the mayor.
I will see him later.

35
00:04:00,525 --> 00:04:01,805
Go, my daughter.

36
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,562
- Don't go too far from the house.
- Yes, Mother.

37
00:04:18,438 --> 00:04:20,680
I can't believe you're finally here.

38
00:04:21,352 --> 00:04:24,383
Me neither. If only I could live here.

39
00:04:24,704 --> 00:04:28,617
Why would someone from the city want
to live here?

40
00:04:28,773 --> 00:04:31,726
What's here in the village?
A few sheep?

41
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:36,672
There are trees, birds...

42
00:04:38,289 --> 00:04:39,687
And you.

43
00:04:42,454 --> 00:04:43,922
Listen...

44
00:04:44,641 --> 00:04:49,008
Don't you dare come live here. What
if it works out and I go live in the city?

45
00:04:49,033 --> 00:04:52,234
I'd kill you. Really, I would!

46
00:04:54,172 --> 00:04:57,984
Imagine if I were to go to school in the
city?

47
00:04:58,828 --> 00:05:04,117
I would have a school bag and
notebooks and pencils.

48
00:05:05,829 --> 00:05:09,859
We would go to school together in the
car.

49
00:05:13,156 --> 00:05:16,228
Speaking of school.
Any updates from your father?

50
00:05:17,249 --> 00:05:21,187
I still don't know... I'm
hoping to find out today.

51
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:26,562
- Aren't those the English?
- Looks like it.

52
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:35,647
Go! Good riddance!

53
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:42,410
- How do you say that in English?
- I don't know... Maybe ''goodbye''?

54
00:05:44,086 --> 00:05:46,719
Goodbye. Goodbye!

55
00:05:49,094 --> 00:05:52,984
Look at the mess you’ve made! Even
while leaving!

56
00:05:53,164 --> 00:05:56,437
- Get out of here! Go away!
- Out!

57
00:06:07,812 --> 00:06:09,444
Wait for me!

58
00:06:10,258 --> 00:06:11,547
Wait for me!

59
00:06:14,882 --> 00:06:16,672
Wait for me!

60
00:06:20,727 --> 00:06:23,648
I shot an Englishman!

61
00:06:28,281 --> 00:06:31,569
What weapons? And what armed men?

62
00:06:31,678 --> 00:06:35,163
You speak as if we have a real army.

63
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:39,461
Fully equipped with machines guns,
tanks, planes.

64
00:06:39,486 --> 00:06:43,203
All we have are a few rusted weapons
and dud bullets.

65
00:06:43,258 --> 00:06:46,516
Some bullets are even filled with wax.

66
00:06:51,289 --> 00:06:56,812
Welcome Farha. My God, my God!

67
00:06:57,718 --> 00:07:01,558
- I wouldn't recognize you in the street.
- How are you, uncle?

68
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:03,664
Great, now that I see you!

69
00:07:04,297 --> 00:07:08,664
Yes, Farha is all grown up.
Now, it's time to see her as a bride.

70
00:07:09,086 --> 00:07:11,281
Come on... She is still young.

71
00:07:11,461 --> 00:07:16,758
Father, school registration
will close by the end of next week.

72
00:07:17,719 --> 00:07:22,484
My dear, we already discussed this.
Now is not the time. Serve your uncle tea.

73
00:07:29,024 --> 00:07:31,086
Thank you very much.

74
00:07:32,187 --> 00:07:35,586
Thanks. Set it down on the table. I'll
drink soon.

75
00:07:39,766 --> 00:07:46,141
Thank you for your hospitality, Abu
Farha.

76
00:08:00,233 --> 00:08:05,531
- Sameeha! Where are you?
- I'm coming.

77
00:08:05,563 --> 00:08:08,187
Hurry, so you can leave before it gets
dark.

78
00:08:08,212 --> 00:08:09,892
Come on sister, faster.

79
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:14,380
You're leaving before receiving proper
hospitality.

80
00:08:16,211 --> 00:08:20,898
Certainly not.
You've been more than generous.

81
00:08:21,015 --> 00:08:25,148
You know how much I like talking with
you.

82
00:08:25,188 --> 00:08:27,461
But you know the situation.

83
00:08:28,071 --> 00:08:31,492
Our mother is sick and the roads are
not safe nowadays.

84
00:08:31,517 --> 00:08:33,578
It's better to get there before sunset.

85
00:08:33,851 --> 00:08:36,742
I hope your mother feels better soon.

86
00:08:38,188 --> 00:08:42,578
And try to visit us more often, not once
every two months!

87
00:08:42,603 --> 00:08:48,703
God willing. Listen. Take it easy on the
girl.

88
00:08:49,391 --> 00:08:54,734
So what if she wants to get an
education?

89
00:08:56,352 --> 00:09:02,562
What could happen? Educating the
young is like engraving in stone.

90
00:09:02,586 --> 00:09:08,484
Well... We do not want to go against
the flow.

91
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,844
Let me find her a husband who can take
care of her in these circumstances.

92
00:09:12,869 --> 00:09:17,669
Besides, you are the only one encouraging
her. She is already very stubborn.

93
00:09:18,429 --> 00:09:24,726
Listen, the newspaper I got you has the
registration paper for the city's school.

94
00:09:24,766 --> 00:09:26,820
- No...
- Listen!

95
00:09:27,094 --> 00:09:31,656
Think about it, but don't take too long.
There's not much time left.

96
00:09:32,383 --> 00:09:35,583
I will take care of her
when she comes to the city.

97
00:09:35,766 --> 00:09:38,883
Farha can take care of herself.
Wait no longer, say yes

98
00:09:39,594 --> 00:09:43,398
- Hello, sister.
- I am ready to go.

99
00:09:43,437 --> 00:09:49,585
You are family and your word is of great
value. You know how dear you are to us.

100
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:52,906
- I will think about it.
- Good.

101
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,445
Where is Farha?
We want to say goodbye!

102
00:09:57,742 --> 00:10:01,851
Where are you, Farha?
Come over here, precious one.

103
00:10:04,749 --> 00:10:06,117
I won't be away long.

104
00:10:08,344 --> 00:10:12,568
Take care of your father.
Hopefully, everything will turn out fine.

105
00:10:13,382 --> 00:10:17,750
Right... We must leave now.
Remember what we discussed. Goodbye.

106
00:10:17,775 --> 00:10:18,775
Goodbye.

107
00:10:19,266 --> 00:10:20,546
I won't be long.

108
00:10:22,469 --> 00:10:26,304
- Next time we should play backgammon.
- So you want to lose?

109
00:10:29,149 --> 00:10:32,492
- Take care. See you soon.
- God be with you!

110
00:10:32,547 --> 00:10:35,226
- Thank you.
- Take care on the road.

111
00:11:03,211 --> 00:11:07,804
- You're always welcome here.
- Having you with us reassures us.

112
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:11,656
Thank you.
I need your advice on a matter.

113
00:11:12,898 --> 00:11:18,976
Farha is smart and she's into education.

114
00:11:19,001 --> 00:11:23,179
I'm thinking of sending her to the city.
So she can study.

115
00:11:23,204 --> 00:11:25,453
I don't want to disappoint her.

116
00:11:25,617 --> 00:11:29,273
You've educated her.
You know her as well as me.

117
00:11:30,296 --> 00:11:32,883
We discussed this, Mayor.

118
00:11:32,907 --> 00:11:36,450
She should remain by your side
under these unsettling circumstance.

119
00:11:36,475 --> 00:11:39,208
- The situation is not safe.
- I understand.

120
00:11:39,233 --> 00:11:42,544
And what education are you talking about?

121
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:46,583
She already learned the Quran. What
else is there to learn?

122
00:11:52,302 --> 00:11:56,888
Geography, history, math, English!

123
00:11:57,623 --> 00:11:58,623
Farha!

124
00:12:01,607 --> 00:12:03,450
Where did she get this stubbornness?

125
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:10,615
- Who is it?
- Open the door. It's me, Naser.

126
00:12:13,287 --> 00:12:15,763
- Yes?
- How are you, Farha?

127
00:12:15,788 --> 00:12:16,788
Good.

128
00:12:16,813 --> 00:12:20,779
Here. It's food prepared by my mother
until your stepmother is back.

129
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,818
- Thanks.
- Wait, wait...

130
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:28,754
- So you don't know how to cook at all?
- No, I don't!

131
00:12:33,951 --> 00:12:35,482
I can't see!

132
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,292
I can't see...!

133
00:13:41,756 --> 00:13:43,950
- Did you have fun?
- Yes.

134
00:13:53,122 --> 00:13:58,021
- Isn't that Naser?
- Yes... Let's go.

135
00:14:05,584 --> 00:14:08,888
What were you talking about with my
uncle and his son?

136
00:14:15,467 --> 00:14:16,467
Father.

137
00:14:19,865 --> 00:14:21,068
Father!

138
00:14:21,287 --> 00:14:23,630
- Abu Fahed!
- Hello, mayor.

139
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:25,455
- How are you?
- Fine, thanks.

140
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,677
What were you talking about with my
uncle and his son?

141
00:14:34,287 --> 00:14:36,220
You mean your future husband?

142
00:14:43,803 --> 00:14:44,803
Go ahead.

143
00:14:45,412 --> 00:14:47,812
What's wrong with your cousin Naser?

144
00:14:51,943 --> 00:14:55,818
And why not get married? All the
village girls are getting married.

145
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:58,028
I don't want to get married.

146
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:04,302
What? What are you saying?
Stop where you are right now!

147
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:09,786
Shame on you.
This is how she speaks to her father!

148
00:15:10,856 --> 00:15:15,144
Her father, who raised her
and brought her the registration paper...

149
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:18,857
so she can study in the city.

150
00:15:20,193 --> 00:15:21,393
Really, Father?

151
00:15:34,404 --> 00:15:35,764
Is this for real?

152
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:51,130
Hey...?

153
00:15:53,224 --> 00:15:56,427
Ah wee ha - Farha is going to the city
school!

154
00:15:56,452 --> 00:15:59,865
-Ah wee ha - Farida will be over the moon
-Don't make a scene!

155
00:15:59,903 --> 00:16:01,193
Get down here!

156
00:16:01,404 --> 00:16:04,911
Ah wee ha, and the mayor is the best
father in the whole village

157
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:08,233
This girl will be the end of me!

158
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:53,794
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

159
00:17:09,927 --> 00:17:13,825
Almost all Palestinians

160
00:17:13,887 --> 00:17:17,605
in the center and to the south are now
displaced.

161
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:20,893
And they are seeking refuge elsewhere.

162
00:17:20,933 --> 00:17:26,534
And ever since my family was
entrusted with this village,

163
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:32,534
all we care about is to keep the
land safe as well as people's lives.

164
00:17:34,424 --> 00:17:39,667
- So this is your final decision, mayor?
- I've said everything I have to say.

165
00:17:39,876 --> 00:17:44,706
We welcomed you in our home and we
respect you as our esteemed guests.

166
00:17:44,987 --> 00:17:47,526
Come on, men. We have no more time
to waste!

167
00:17:49,331 --> 00:17:52,354
Abu Nimer! Listen to me.

168
00:17:56,409 --> 00:18:01,995
I was promised that the Arab countries

169
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,487
will send both troops and ammunition.

170
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:08,463
It's better that we wait. When they arrive,

171
00:18:08,488 --> 00:18:10,573
I will head this army myself.

172
00:18:10,598 --> 00:18:16,135
- And I will be the first one to fight.
- This isn’t a truce. They are buying time.

173
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,737
Eventually, your land will turn into
ashes.

174
00:18:18,762 --> 00:18:22,651
I never expected that you would let us
down. Goodbye!

175
00:18:30,346 --> 00:18:33,651
I hope your troops don't take too long,
Abu Farha!

176
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:08,487
REGISTRATION PAPER:
FARHA, SCHOOL YEAR 1948/1949

177
00:19:12,378 --> 00:19:13,378
Father?

178
00:19:23,831 --> 00:19:24,831
Father?

179
00:19:53,885 --> 00:19:57,885
Farha, why are you up so early?

180
00:20:12,136 --> 00:20:13,936
What are you doing, Father?

181
00:20:16,229 --> 00:20:19,260
I'm filling the gaps between the stones.

182
00:20:22,081 --> 00:20:26,198
And mud holds the stones together.

183
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,713
Don't you want to go back to sleep?

184
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,143
I forgot to tell you, my father said yes.

185
00:20:56,878 --> 00:21:01,104
- Really? For sure?
- Yes.

186
00:21:06,253 --> 00:21:07,773
I can't believe it!

187
00:21:10,276 --> 00:21:13,471
- Is something wrong?
- No, it's nothing.

188
00:21:15,323 --> 00:21:17,003
You don't seem happy.

189
00:21:18,988 --> 00:21:20,408
Of course I'm happy.

190
00:21:22,425 --> 00:21:24,323
But I'm worried about my father.

191
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:27,190
It will be difficult to leave him.

192
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:29,799
That's all.

193
00:21:32,604 --> 00:21:34,033
But he won’t be alone.

194
00:21:45,284 --> 00:21:48,846
- I know why you're upset.
- Why?

195
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:53,706
- You lost the groom!
- Hey!

196
00:22:00,306 --> 00:22:03,651
Enough! No, no. Stop!
I'll be quiet.

197
00:22:07,956 --> 00:22:11,292
- Don't worry. He'll wait for you.
- Farida!

198
00:22:11,317 --> 00:22:13,979
Fine, fine. Enough, I'll stop!

199
00:22:19,862 --> 00:22:21,796
You know what I have decided?

200
00:22:25,042 --> 00:22:29,401
When I finish studying in the city,
I want to become a teacher.

201
00:22:30,573 --> 00:22:34,987
Then I open a school here in the village,
and only for girls.

202
00:22:37,542 --> 00:22:41,721
When I grow up, I want to become...

203
00:23:00,197 --> 00:23:03,971
Have mercy on your women and
children and save them from this bloodbath.

204
00:23:04,777 --> 00:23:06,698
Get out of this village while you still
can.

205
00:23:06,723 --> 00:23:08,674
Oh God! Oh God!

206
00:23:15,346 --> 00:23:17,549
Go away! Get out of here!

207
00:23:24,448 --> 00:23:26,081
Run! Run!

208
00:23:26,401 --> 00:23:31,885
Get out by using the north road while
it's still open.

209
00:23:34,933 --> 00:23:36,588
Are you hurt?

210
00:23:36,816 --> 00:23:38,816
Where have you been? Let's go!

211
00:23:43,518 --> 00:23:46,588
Farida! Farida, are you OK?

212
00:23:47,455 --> 00:23:50,206
We must hurry! Go!

213
00:23:50,651 --> 00:23:53,229
- Get in the car!
- Where's my father?

214
00:23:55,144 --> 00:23:59,854
- Did you see my father?
- We will look for him. Get in, Farha!

215
00:24:00,635 --> 00:24:02,299
Get in! Where are you going?

216
00:24:03,448 --> 00:24:05,987
Hey! What are you doing?

217
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,362
Masoud!

218
00:24:09,909 --> 00:24:13,479
Masoud! Please take care of her.

219
00:24:13,504 --> 00:24:15,760
-Get in the car
-You heard your father.

220
00:24:15,785 --> 00:24:16,785
No, Father.

221
00:24:16,832 --> 00:24:20,831
My daughter, get inside now!

222
00:24:22,307 --> 00:24:23,651
Are you OK, Farha?

223
00:24:23,676 --> 00:24:25,088
From where are they coming in?

224
00:24:25,113 --> 00:24:28,846
They surrounded the village from all
sides. Only the north exit is still open.

225
00:24:28,871 --> 00:24:33,190
Go north, to Khallet Al Taweel.
I'll be behind you.

226
00:24:33,215 --> 00:24:34,815
I'm not leaving you.

227
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:38,439
I'll secure the family, go to the other

228
00:24:38,464 --> 00:24:40,370
village heads and come back for you.

229
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:42,362
Kamel!

230
00:25:05,386 --> 00:25:08,737
- Look out. Look out!
- Calm down.

231
00:25:33,236 --> 00:25:35,628
- Stop the car, uncle.
- There is no time!

232
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:37,995
- Let me out!
- Stay here!

233
00:25:38,901 --> 00:25:42,542
- Farha, stop it!
- I have to stay with my father!

234
00:25:43,885 --> 00:25:48,073
- Oh God!
- Take the women!

235
00:25:48,815 --> 00:25:49,963
Farha!

236
00:25:55,659 --> 00:25:58,878
- Farha! Farha!
- What are you doing? Get in!

237
00:26:18,876 --> 00:26:20,384
Farha!

238
00:26:34,745 --> 00:26:36,425
Why did you come back...

239
00:26:54,776 --> 00:26:57,784
- Father?
- Farha!

240
00:26:59,792 --> 00:27:04,401
- What's this, father?
- The village has fallen.

241
00:27:04,426 --> 00:27:05,946
Where should we go?

242
00:27:07,518 --> 00:27:08,878
What shall we do?

243
00:27:11,268 --> 00:27:12,788
What are you doing?

244
00:27:12,813 --> 00:27:14,493
Are we going to Farida's?

245
00:27:14,706 --> 00:27:18,924
Farida... I told you to go with Masoud,
but you did not listen!

246
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:26,237
Are we going to the city?

247
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,940
Where should we go...?

248
00:27:39,619 --> 00:27:43,284
Why didn't you listen to me?

249
00:27:47,245 --> 00:27:50,893
- Come with me.
- Where are we going?

250
00:27:59,472 --> 00:28:02,138
There is no time for food. We have to
go!

251
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:10,526
- We should follow them.
- Go in and wait for me.

252
00:28:10,551 --> 00:28:12,440
- No.
- I will come back to get you.

253
00:28:13,237 --> 00:28:15,573
- Do you understand?
- I will stay with you.

254
00:28:15,598 --> 00:28:18,299
- I will be back.
- I want to stay with you, father.

255
00:28:18,324 --> 00:28:19,764
It's not possible.

256
00:28:19,971 --> 00:28:22,838
I will not repeat myself. Do as I tell you.

257
00:28:23,261 --> 00:28:24,621
Come on. Get in!

258
00:28:24,645 --> 00:28:25,685
No, I won't!

259
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:30,213
Don't be afraid. I'll come back for you.
There's no time for this!

260
00:28:31,136 --> 00:28:33,628
- Listen...
- Father...?

261
00:28:33,987 --> 00:28:36,495
- This is the safest place.
- Then stay with me!

262
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:41,320
I can't! I have to be with the people.
The soldiers have invaded our village.

263
00:28:41,728 --> 00:28:42,893
Please, understand.

264
00:28:42,918 --> 00:28:44,598
- No, Father!
- Calm down.

265
00:28:44,631 --> 00:28:46,497
Wait here for me.
I'll come back to get you.

266
00:28:46,522 --> 00:28:51,490
Don't be afraid. I won't be long.

267
00:29:02,103 --> 00:29:03,943
Keep this with you.

268
00:29:46,763 --> 00:29:48,396
Do you hear me?

269
00:29:48,662 --> 00:29:50,888
- Father!
- I will not leave you.

270
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,615
Stay with me!

271
00:29:56,592 --> 00:29:57,732
Farha...

272
00:29:59,732 --> 00:30:01,325
I will be back.

273
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:04,465
Stay inside.

274
00:30:06,294 --> 00:30:07,654
Do not be afraid.

275
00:32:08,826 --> 00:32:09,826
Father...?

276
00:35:24,287 --> 00:35:25,287
Father?

277
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:09,779
TO MY DEAREST FRIEND, FARHA
FROM FARIDA

278
00:37:25,123 --> 00:37:26,123
Father...?

279
00:38:03,717 --> 00:38:05,177
Get out now!

280
00:38:27,575 --> 00:38:30,091
Take the boy and move fast!

281
00:46:49,834 --> 00:46:54,115
REGISTRATION PAPER:
FARHA, SCHOOL YEAR 1948/1949

282
00:49:43,623 --> 00:49:48,818
Ah wee ha
Farha is going to the city's school

283
00:49:52,076 --> 00:49:58,911
Ah wee ha
Farida will be over the moon

284
00:50:01,490 --> 00:50:03,536
Ah wee ha...

285
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:38,294
Come on...

286
00:50:42,833 --> 00:50:44,809
There's a place here. Come on.

287
00:50:48,623 --> 00:50:51,810
- Quiet. Keep it low...
- I can't!

288
00:50:55,247 --> 00:50:56,513
Sit down here.

289
00:51:11,935 --> 00:51:15,685
Take your sister and give her water.

290
00:51:15,974 --> 00:51:18,146
It will be over soon.

291
00:51:19,849 --> 00:51:22,677
Push! Push! Come on...

292
00:51:23,646 --> 00:51:25,294
Keep it low!

293
00:51:28,529 --> 00:51:30,927
I can see the head.
It'll be fine.

294
00:51:30,952 --> 00:51:32,472
Push a little more!

295
00:51:42,295 --> 00:51:45,029
A boy... Mohammed!

296
00:51:46,865 --> 00:51:49,497
Congratulations, Abu Mohammed.

297
00:51:51,303 --> 00:51:52,872
Give me a stone.

298
00:52:11,496 --> 00:52:13,365
God is great.

299
00:52:13,528 --> 00:52:15,099
I bear witness

300
00:52:15,906 --> 00:52:18,075
that there is no deity but God.

301
00:52:18,185 --> 00:52:22,747
I bear witness that Muhammad
is the messenger of God.

302
00:52:27,928 --> 00:52:30,544
Here, take your brother.

303
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:58,771
Abu Mohammed!

304
00:53:14,795 --> 00:53:16,224
Abu Mohammed!

305
00:53:23,942 --> 00:53:25,255
I'm in here!

306
00:53:28,709 --> 00:53:29,709
Who are you?

307
00:53:29,733 --> 00:53:31,193
What are you doing here?

308
00:53:31,217 --> 00:53:35,630
My father left me and never came back.
I'm worried about him.

309
00:53:36,623 --> 00:53:39,427
Get me out of here!
The door is there.

310
00:53:39,701 --> 00:53:42,115
Fine. OK.

311
00:53:49,224 --> 00:53:50,669
Move away from the door!

312
00:54:17,310 --> 00:54:19,419
Keep quiet...!

313
00:54:19,444 --> 00:54:22,344
Leave your houses!
If not, you will be killed!

314
00:54:22,369 --> 00:54:24,236
Abu Mohammed, where are you?

315
00:54:25,981 --> 00:54:28,264
Don't make a sound.
Hide the girls!

316
00:54:32,809 --> 00:54:37,107
Leave your houses
with your women and children!

317
00:54:37,132 --> 00:54:39,560
Go and hide on the roof...

318
00:54:40,013 --> 00:54:42,575
Get out, or you will be killed.

319
00:54:47,254 --> 00:54:48,457
Get outside.

320
00:54:48,482 --> 00:54:50,599
Or you will be killed in the houses.

321
00:55:00,021 --> 00:55:02,966
Don't move!
I'm talking to you.

322
00:55:03,348 --> 00:55:04,535
Come here!

323
00:55:08,731 --> 00:55:09,731
Come here.

324
00:55:17,849 --> 00:55:18,849
Hands up.

325
00:55:27,763 --> 00:55:30,247
- What's this?
- These are my papers.

326
00:55:36,412 --> 00:55:38,208
- Clear.
- Turn!

327
00:55:41,049 --> 00:55:42,049
Turn!

328
00:55:43,076 --> 00:55:44,356
Do you know him?

329
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:49,958
No. He's from another village.
He's not a fighter!

330
00:55:49,983 --> 00:55:54,091
Shut up!
Sir, he just came out of here.

331
00:55:55,036 --> 00:55:59,349
There is nothing in this house.
You cannot find any guns.

332
00:56:01,013 --> 00:56:05,185
- OK. Search the house!
- Yes.

333
00:56:05,396 --> 00:56:07,177
You. Walk.

334
00:56:07,209 --> 00:56:10,325
- There's nothing here.
- Keep walking!

335
00:56:10,631 --> 00:56:13,349
- There is nothing here.
- Come on!

336
00:56:14,138 --> 00:56:15,607
I just passed by.

337
00:56:16,122 --> 00:56:17,802
I say, I just walked by!

338
00:56:20,943 --> 00:56:22,623
There's nothing here.

339
00:56:22,647 --> 00:56:25,115
I just wanted to drink some water.

340
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:27,865
Walk! Go on!

341
00:56:31,349 --> 00:56:36,521
There's no one here.
I don't know whose house this is!

342
00:56:39,982 --> 00:56:43,146
Stand there. Keep your hands up.

343
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:00,060
What's your name?

344
00:57:00,506 --> 00:57:04,318
Saleh.
I'm not from this village.

345
00:57:05,779 --> 00:57:07,059
I'm from Aseera.

346
00:57:07,232 --> 00:57:11,099
I was passing by and wanted to drink
some water.

347
00:57:36,037 --> 00:57:37,037
What's this?

348
00:57:43,146 --> 00:57:46,638
What's this?!
Where are you hiding the weapons?

349
00:57:46,786 --> 00:57:48,122
I don't know.

350
00:57:49,092 --> 00:57:54,544
He's not from here. I told you.
He's a villager, not a fighter.

351
00:57:55,498 --> 00:57:57,178
This house is not his,

352
00:57:57,202 --> 00:57:59,335
and you cannot find any weapons!

353
00:58:07,928 --> 00:58:09,536
OK, I'll check.

354
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:30,992
You came back for the weapons.
You know where they are.

355
00:58:33,914 --> 00:58:36,492
- Search the house!
- Yes, sir.

356
00:58:57,211 --> 00:58:58,492
Clear, sir.

357
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:01,747
- Clear.
- Nothing here.

358
00:59:41,716 --> 00:59:46,911
Hold on. Hold on...
Look what I found!

359
00:59:48,943 --> 00:59:53,115
- Let her go!
- Don't move!

360
00:59:54,295 --> 00:59:56,761
- This doesn't concern women!
- Stop it!

361
00:59:57,356 --> 01:00:00,099
- Search her.
- Yes, sir.

362
01:00:25,044 --> 01:00:26,240
You are pregnant?

363
01:00:43,865 --> 01:00:47,700
- It's always the same hiding place.
- Shut up!

364
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:53,982
A key!

365
01:01:02,339 --> 01:01:04,354
Keep it as a souvenir.

366
01:01:11,284 --> 01:01:13,617
- Leave her alone, you prick.
- Quiet!

367
01:01:22,573 --> 01:01:26,159
- Boy or girl?
- Girl.

368
01:01:26,184 --> 01:01:29,104
- A boy.
- It surely looks like a boy.

369
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:35,737
- I also say it's a boy.
- What is he saying?

370
01:01:36,215 --> 01:01:38,581
What do you say? Boy or girl?

371
01:01:39,125 --> 01:01:41,417
- Stop it.
- You prick!

372
01:01:41,442 --> 01:01:45,424
- Wait, Wait. She's just a woman!
- Don't worry, Muyassar.

373
01:01:46,268 --> 01:01:48,198
She's just a woman.

374
01:02:17,073 --> 01:02:18,768
- Let them be!
- Move.

375
01:02:21,526 --> 01:02:23,206
They are just children!

376
01:02:31,706 --> 01:02:32,870
Mother...

377
01:02:42,064 --> 01:02:43,864
Don't worry. Don't worry...

378
01:02:46,198 --> 01:02:50,018
Kill me. I'm the man here.
Kill me!

379
01:02:58,439 --> 01:03:03,518
So you did not hide weapons.
But you hid something else.

380
01:03:04,401 --> 01:03:05,456
Saleh!

381
01:03:10,675 --> 01:03:12,096
Let them go!

382
01:03:13,853 --> 01:03:18,893
- Take them to the wall!
- Move. Go on!

383
01:03:28,612 --> 01:03:30,401
Why are you hiding your face?

384
01:03:30,799 --> 01:03:35,909
You cannot hide behind a mask.
Betrayer!

385
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:40,221
Move. Move!

386
01:03:41,885 --> 01:03:43,429
What are you doing?

387
01:03:43,453 --> 01:03:47,698
You promised me. No women, no children!

388
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:51,792
You asked me for weapons.

389
01:03:53,401 --> 01:03:55,948
- What are you doing?
- Fine.

390
01:04:14,494 --> 01:04:17,103
- In position!
- Yes...

391
01:04:22,298 --> 01:04:26,924
- Take aim!
- Please, you promised me. Please...

392
01:04:27,128 --> 01:04:31,745
Don't do it! They are just children.
They are not fighters.

393
01:04:31,987 --> 01:04:32,987
Please!

394
01:04:33,956 --> 01:04:36,940
- Fire!
- You promised me. No!

395
01:05:28,081 --> 01:05:30,495
- No, no...
- What are you doing there?

396
01:05:31,105 --> 01:05:34,417
- Come and help me.
- Coming...

397
01:05:41,417 --> 01:05:42,838
Hurry, hurry...

398
01:05:54,675 --> 01:05:58,003
Go fetch water! Instead of doing
nothing.

399
01:06:00,722 --> 01:06:04,417
He’s really heavy. We need help,
please.

400
01:06:59,011 --> 01:07:00,190
Farha!

401
01:07:54,909 --> 01:07:59,354
No, no.
We left the baby for you.

402
01:08:00,386 --> 01:08:03,823
A boy. I was right, I win.

403
01:08:04,745 --> 01:08:06,487
Finish him and come.

404
01:08:14,651 --> 01:08:16,718
And don't waste a bullet on it!

405
01:08:17,972 --> 01:08:19,346
Don’t be late!

406
01:14:26,786 --> 01:14:33,318
Little baby Mohammed Sleep in your
bed

407
01:14:35,474 --> 01:14:41,786
The little bird will come in the morning
And wake you up early

408
01:14:43,872 --> 01:14:49,810
I'm here close to you
Sleep peacefully

409
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:58,052
All the children in the neighborhood
slept a long time ago

410
01:25:29,479 --> 01:25:33,146
TO MY DEAREST FRIEND, FARHA
FROM FARIDA

411
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:50,793
Farha never found her father and his
fate after the Diaspora remains unknown,

412
01:26:50,818 --> 01:26:54,036
but it is believed that he was killed in
the events of Al-Nakba (the Catastrophe)

413
01:26:54,061 --> 01:26:55,794
in 1948.

414
01:26:55,911 --> 01:27:00,513
Farha (whose name is Radiyyeh in
the original events) made it to Syria,

415
01:27:00,538 --> 01:27:06,310
where she shared her stoyr,
keeping it alive for generations to come.
