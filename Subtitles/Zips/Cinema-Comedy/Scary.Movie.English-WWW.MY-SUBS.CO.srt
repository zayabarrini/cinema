1
00:00:19,733 --> 00:00:22,442
- Hello.
- Wanna have a little fun?

2
00:00:22,568 --> 00:00:25,693
- Who's this?
- Tell me your name and I'll tell you mine.

3
00:00:25,818 --> 00:00:27,736
I don't think so.

4
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:30,779
- What's that noise?
- Oops. I farted.

5
00:00:30,861 --> 00:00:34,113
- I didn't think you would hear me.
- No, that popping noise.

6
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:37,948
Oh. I'm making popcorn.
I'm getting ready to watch a video.

7
00:00:38,073 --> 00:00:41,740
- Ooh. What is it?
- It's just a scary movie.

8
00:00:41,866 --> 00:00:43,825
- Do you like scary movies?
- Mm-hmm.

9
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,159
- What's your favorite?
- Mm, I don't know.

10
00:00:47,243 --> 00:00:49,161
Think.

11
00:00:49,243 --> 00:00:52,786
Oh, I know. Um, Kazaam,
the one where Shaq plays a genie.

12
00:00:52,869 --> 00:00:56,246
- That's not a horror movie.
- Well, you haven't seen Shaq act.

13
00:00:58,122 --> 00:01:01,205
- Hey, you have a nice voice.
- Thanks.

14
00:01:01,331 --> 00:01:03,457
You never did tell me your name.

15
00:01:03,582 --> 00:01:05,792
Why do you wanna know my name?

16
00:01:05,917 --> 00:01:08,583
Cause I wanna know
who I'm looking at.

17
00:01:10,293 --> 00:01:12,418
What--
What did you say?

18
00:01:12,502 --> 00:01:14,753
Nice breasts.

19
00:01:14,877 --> 00:01:16,753
Look, what do you want?

20
00:01:16,878 --> 00:01:19,547
I wanna see
what your insides look like.

21
00:01:19,671 --> 00:01:22,046
Well-- Well, then,
turn to page 54.

22
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:23,756
Oh.

23
00:01:23,882 --> 00:01:25,756
Hey, nice.

24
00:01:27,589 --> 00:01:31,716
Listen, asshole, you've had your fun,
now you better stop or else.

25
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:34,885
- Or else what?
- Or else my boyfriends
gonna be here any minute,

26
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:37,053
and he's black
and he'll kick your ass.

27
00:01:37,135 --> 00:01:39,054
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

28
00:01:39,137 --> 00:01:41,262
You mean the one who wears makeup
and dresses like a woman?

29
00:01:41,387 --> 00:01:44,389
- How did you know?
- Turn the porch lights on.

30
00:01:50,558 --> 00:01:53,640
Help! Help!

31
00:01:53,724 --> 00:01:55,955
Oh, that's not my boyfriend.
I mean, I've

32
00:01:55,956 --> 00:01:58,185
fucked him a couple of
times, but that's it.

33
00:01:58,267 --> 00:02:01,519
Look, I'm calling the cops.

34
00:02:01,602 --> 00:02:03,811
Go ahead. Call the cops.

35
00:02:03,894 --> 00:02:06,938
But you might wanna
check the back door first.

36
00:02:07,063 --> 00:02:09,063
You forgot to lock it.

37
00:02:32,113 --> 00:02:34,030
Take that, you psycho!

38
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,365
I cant feel my legs.

39
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,950
I think my arm is broken.

40
00:02:42,034 --> 00:02:45,618
- Sorry.
- I want my mommy.

41
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,579
Hello, Drew.

42
00:03:08,085 --> 00:03:09,960
Oh, God!

43
00:04:09,981 --> 00:04:14,149
- Daddy! Daddy!
- Ugh!

44
00:04:14,274 --> 00:04:16,859
Daddy!

45
00:04:16,943 --> 00:04:19,276
Daddy!

46
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,486
Daddy, no! No!

47
00:04:24,445 --> 00:04:27,446
- Did you hear something?
- No, I didn't hear anything.

48
00:04:53,997 --> 00:04:58,791
Bobby, what are you doing?
My dads in the other room.

49
00:04:58,874 --> 00:05:01,541
It just occurred to me. I never
climbed through your window before.

50
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:05,209
Now that you got it out of your system,
Bobby, you have to leave.

51
00:05:05,292 --> 00:05:06,542
Why?

52
00:05:06,667 --> 00:05:08,918
Shh. Come on.

53
00:05:09,044 --> 00:05:10,961
What's going on in there?

54
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:14,337
Ow! Daddy's head is stuck.
Unstick Daddy's head.

55
00:05:14,462 --> 00:05:17,421
Dad, can you knock?

56
00:05:17,546 --> 00:05:21,964
- Knock?
I thought I heard screaming in here.
- No. No, you didn't, Dad.

57
00:05:22,048 --> 00:05:24,674
Well, it could've been that crack
I smoked earlier, I guess.

58
00:05:24,799 --> 00:05:26,634
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that's what it was.

59
00:05:26,716 --> 00:05:28,760
I gotta leave town
for a couple of days.

60
00:05:28,885 --> 00:05:31,635
No big deal. Just that new business
I started with those Colombian guys?

61
00:05:31,719 --> 00:05:34,512
- Oh, you mean Uncle Escobar.
- Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

62
00:05:34,637 --> 00:05:36,971
Well, there's a problem.
Some money went missing.

63
00:05:37,053 --> 00:05:39,097
And apparently,
some legs are gonna get broken.

64
00:05:39,222 --> 00:05:41,597
It's just better if I lay low
for a couple of days.

65
00:05:41,721 --> 00:05:44,098
- If the cops raid the place--
- I never heard of you.

66
00:05:44,223 --> 00:05:46,557
- And don't forget--
- To flush your stash.

67
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,475
Oh, you are my little girl.
I love you so much...

68
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,600
that I left you a little something
in the coffee can.

69
00:05:51,725 --> 00:05:55,310
- Dad--
- But you have to remember to step
on it before you sell it.

70
00:05:55,435 --> 00:05:58,352
- Now, what are you
gonna cut it with?
- Um, baking--

71
00:05:58,435 --> 00:06:00,354
Baking soda.
Not baking powder.

72
00:06:00,436 --> 00:06:03,480
Because baking powder guys
will have muffins growing
out of their nose.

73
00:06:03,562 --> 00:06:05,813
You love that joke,
don't you, honey?

74
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:09,107
You've loved that joke
since you were two years old.

75
00:06:09,232 --> 00:06:11,315
- Okay, well--
- Okay, I love you.

76
00:06:11,441 --> 00:06:13,400
- I love you.
- Have a good trip.

77
00:06:13,483 --> 00:06:15,942
- Bye.
- Bye. Whew!

78
00:06:16,027 --> 00:06:18,234
Is the coast clear?

79
00:06:18,318 --> 00:06:21,486
Oh, Cindy, that nightgown.

80
00:06:21,611 --> 00:06:24,780
That was close. God!

81
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:32,865
I was, uh, home watching
The Exorcist, and it
got me thinking about you.

82
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,032
If this is about the
time I puked green

83
00:06:35,033 --> 00:06:37,074
slime and masturbated
with a crucifix--

84
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,367
It was my first keg party, Bobby.

85
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:43,952
No. No. Uh, it was edited for TV.
All the good stuff was cut out.

86
00:06:44,077 --> 00:06:46,953
So you thought you would just climb
through my window...

87
00:06:47,078 --> 00:06:49,078
and we would
play bump-bump?

88
00:06:49,203 --> 00:06:51,247
I was kind of hoping
to get my balls licked,

89
00:06:51,372 --> 00:06:54,040
but I wouldn't wanna break
your little underwear rule,
now, would I?

90
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:57,456
So maybe just some
on-top-of-the-clothes type stuff?

91
00:07:00,793 --> 00:07:03,668
Okay. But just for a minute.

92
00:07:18,964 --> 00:07:21,257
What the--

93
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:23,300
Wrong set.

94
00:07:26,884 --> 00:07:30,468
Bobby! Oh, Bobby!

95
00:07:30,553 --> 00:07:33,678
I don't wanna wait
for our lives to be over

96
00:07:33,803 --> 00:07:35,929
- No, Bobby, don't.
- Ow!

97
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,973
Jeez.

98
00:07:41,057 --> 00:07:43,640
Yeah, my dad.

99
00:07:43,765 --> 00:07:48,850
Okay, stud,
you have to go now.

100
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:54,311
Oh, um,
about the sex stuff?

101
00:07:54,436 --> 00:07:56,771
I was only half serious.
I don't wanna rush you or anything.

102
00:07:56,895 --> 00:08:00,145
Hey, would you settle
for PG-13?

103
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:02,855
What's that?

104
00:08:04,273 --> 00:08:05,522
Oh, jeez!

105
00:08:05,648 --> 00:08:08,191
-- Good night, Bobby.

106
00:08:13,568 --> 00:08:16,735
Shorty, you are so loud.

107
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,528
And make sure you take
your behind to class today.

108
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:22,904
- I do be going to class.
- Lunch is not a class, Shorty.

109
00:08:22,987 --> 00:08:25,280
It is when you got
the munchies.

110
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:29,281
- See, that's why
you such a dumb-ass.
- Your mother.

111
00:08:29,407 --> 00:08:33,366
You my brother.
That's your mother too, jackass.

112
00:08:33,491 --> 00:08:36,742
Oh, yeah.
Well, then, your fathers stupid.

113
00:08:36,868 --> 00:08:39,410
So? I don't know him.

114
00:08:39,535 --> 00:08:42,369
Yeah, me neither.

115
00:08:42,494 --> 00:08:46,245
- Hey, girl, you ready?
- Yeah, in a minute.

116
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:50,580
- We're gonna be late.
- Wait. There's Buffy.

117
00:08:50,706 --> 00:08:54,040
I don't know why
you hang out with her.

118
00:08:54,123 --> 00:08:56,457
- She is such a ho.
- Why do you say that?

119
00:08:56,582 --> 00:08:59,125
Cause I've seen her.

120
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:02,043
- My friend Sean
had a pool party this summer.
- Sean?

121
00:09:02,168 --> 00:09:04,127
You know, Puff Daddy?

122
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,752
Anyway, everybody was drinking
Cristal champagne.

123
00:09:06,836 --> 00:09:08,378
And then it started to
get wild, and people

124
00:09:08,379 --> 00:09:09,920
were getting freaky in
the pool and stuff.

125
00:09:10,045 --> 00:09:14,131
I look over and there was
your girl getting buck wild
in the Jacuzzi.

126
00:09:14,255 --> 00:09:15,840
So?

127
00:09:15,923 --> 00:09:19,049
With a backup dancer.

128
00:09:19,174 --> 00:09:21,091
I mean, that's nasty.

129
00:09:21,175 --> 00:09:23,343
That's-That's lower
than the security guard.

130
00:09:23,468 --> 00:09:27,302
At least security can get you backstage.
She don't love herself.

131
00:09:27,384 --> 00:09:30,636
Bye, Daddy.
- I don't know. II think
Buffy's sweet, Brenda.

132
00:09:30,761 --> 00:09:34,097
She is as fake
as Press-onnails.

133
00:09:34,179 --> 00:09:36,513
Hey, baby girl!

134
00:09:38,139 --> 00:09:40,139
What is up,
my sister?

135
00:09:40,224 --> 00:09:42,848
- Bye, Mr. Gilmore.
- Bye!

136
00:09:42,974 --> 00:09:44,725
- Is he gone?
- Yep.

137
00:09:46,059 --> 00:09:49,894
Do you like what you see

138
00:09:50,018 --> 00:09:52,435
It's all about the money

139
00:09:52,518 --> 00:09:54,437
Hey, Cindy!

140
00:09:57,479 --> 00:10:00,564
- I love this color.
- Let me see that.

141
00:10:02,689 --> 00:10:06,315
- Oh, you guys should
not use this brand.
- Why not?

142
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,360
- Because they test
their products on animals.
- So?

143
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:14,027
Look, have you seen what they do
to those poor animals?

144
00:10:15,902 --> 00:10:19,653
Well, I am much more
of a people person.

145
00:10:19,779 --> 00:10:23,029
I'd like to feed all the hungry,
little children of the world.

146
00:10:23,113 --> 00:10:25,655
I’d much rather help my fellow man
than some animal.

147
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,656
- Spare a dollar?
- Get away from me, you bum!

148
00:10:27,781 --> 00:10:30,449
Buffy! Can't you see
he's just hungry?

149
00:10:30,574 --> 00:10:33,492
Here you go, sir.
A nice sandwich.

150
00:10:34,576 --> 00:10:38,119
- See?
- I said a dollar, bitch!

151
00:10:38,201 --> 00:10:40,495
Ow!

152
00:10:40,578 --> 00:10:43,703
God.
Look at this place.

153
00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:46,205
It's a circus.

154
00:10:46,288 --> 00:10:50,999
Hello. I'm Gail Hailstorm, author of
the book, You're Dead, I'm Rich.

155
00:10:51,081 --> 00:10:53,332
A small college town
is in shock...

156
00:10:53,415 --> 00:10:55,626
after the unthinkable
has happened:

157
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,751
a brutal killing spree
that left one teen dead--

158
00:10:58,834 --> 00:11:01,127
That's it. Two teens dead...

159
00:11:01,252 --> 00:11:03,586
and this small town
shaken and stirred.

160
00:11:03,668 --> 00:11:07,212
- Its times like these--
- Police are combing
the area for clues.

161
00:11:07,337 --> 00:11:09,546
There are no witnesses
available at this time.

162
00:11:09,671 --> 00:11:11,547
There are no suspects
in custody.

163
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:13,547
Police are asking anyone
to come forward.

164
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:15,256
Reporting live for Black TV.
White folks are

165
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:16,840
- dead and we're getting
the fuck out of here!

166
00:11:16,924 --> 00:11:20,134
Grab your shit
and lets go, motherfucker!

167
00:11:23,425 --> 00:11:26,928
Hey, do you think the press is gonna
wanna talk to us?

168
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:29,346
Oh, girl, no. The press
only wants to interview

169
00:11:29,347 --> 00:11:31,638
the most ignorant
person they can find.

170
00:11:31,763 --> 00:11:35,473
I'm on TV! Oh, shit!
First Cops, now this!

171
00:11:35,555 --> 00:11:37,473
Oh, man, I'm gonna be
a star, son!

172
00:11:37,556 --> 00:11:42,266
- What can you tell us about Drew?
- Well, she had the fat ass.

173
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:45,350
- I mean, it was like bang!
- How close were you to the victim?

174
00:11:45,434 --> 00:11:48,019
Real close.
Until the roofies wore off.

175
00:11:48,101 --> 00:11:50,144
Then she woke up talking about
pressing charges.

176
00:11:50,228 --> 00:11:52,354
So I just pulled my tongue
out of her ass and left.

177
00:11:52,436 --> 00:11:54,604
What would have been
your last words to Drew?

178
00:11:54,729 --> 00:11:57,772
Run, bitch! Run!

179
00:12:00,856 --> 00:12:04,316
Hey, yo, dawg.
Does this shirt make me look gay?

180
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,317
No, man.

181
00:12:08,067 --> 00:12:10,567
What about now?

182
00:12:10,651 --> 00:12:13,153
- Nah. Yeah.
- Cool?

183
00:12:13,235 --> 00:12:15,611
Here. Take one, guys.
elections Tuesday.

184
00:12:15,694 --> 00:12:18,195
election's Tuesday.

185
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,531
Ah! Goddamn it!
Son of a bitch!

186
00:12:22,614 --> 00:12:25,407
What's the matter, honey?

187
00:12:25,531 --> 00:12:27,408
My report card.

188
00:12:29,991 --> 00:12:32,035
Well, at least
you got one A.

189
00:12:32,117 --> 00:12:35,452
Yeah. I did, huh?

190
00:12:35,535 --> 00:12:39,161
You're so smart.

191
00:12:39,287 --> 00:12:41,621
- Hey, has anybody seen Bobby?
- Nah.

192
00:12:41,746 --> 00:12:44,122
You know what?
That kid is always late.

193
00:12:44,204 --> 00:12:46,539
I don't get it.
He lives so close.

194
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:59,252
See you later,
Hairy Mama, Bubba, Jim,

195
00:12:59,335 --> 00:13:02,254
Big Jim, Little Jim,
Slim Jim, everybody.

196
00:13:02,336 --> 00:13:05,045
I'll see you later. Ciao, Ding.
All right.

197
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:14,299
Damn, girl.
Mm-mm-mm.

198
00:13:14,383 --> 00:13:16,883
- I’d sure like to get in them pants.
- Really?

199
00:13:17,007 --> 00:13:19,551
Yeah. What size are these?

200
00:13:19,676 --> 00:13:21,634
Hey, guys.

201
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:24,553
- Hey, Bobby.
- Hey, baby.

202
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:27,220
- How you doing?
- Good.

203
00:13:27,344 --> 00:13:30,054
- You guys see all
the reporters out there?
- Yeah.

204
00:13:30,138 --> 00:13:32,472
Saying that girl Drew Decker
got killed last night.

205
00:13:32,597 --> 00:13:34,848
- You know what? I think I knew her.
- Really?

206
00:13:34,932 --> 00:13:37,974
- She had a brother named Steve?
- Yeah.

207
00:13:38,099 --> 00:13:40,683
Long hair, pretty little mouth,
perfect ass?

208
00:13:40,808 --> 00:13:43,685
- That was her.
- Nah, I was talking about Steve.

209
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:45,768
Whatever happened
to him?

210
00:13:45,851 --> 00:13:48,770
Do you guys think its strange
that she got killed...

211
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:52,145
exactly one year
after we,

212
00:13:52,229 --> 00:13:54,563
you know,
killed that guy?

213
00:13:54,647 --> 00:13:57,022
Hey, Cindy,
that was an accident.

214
00:13:57,105 --> 00:13:59,023
Was it, Greg?

215
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:06,067
Yeah!

216
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:19,031
Would you look
at what they're doing?

217
00:14:19,156 --> 00:14:21,323
When are we gonna do
stuff like that, huh?

218
00:14:21,406 --> 00:14:23,365
One day.

219
00:14:23,448 --> 00:14:26,033
- You like that, baby?
- Yeah, that's different.

220
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:28,408
- You like that?
- Oh, I love that.

221
00:14:28,491 --> 00:14:30,868
Oh, I love
when you play with my ass.

222
00:14:30,951 --> 00:14:32,868
I'm not playing
with your ass.

223
00:14:35,411 --> 00:14:38,996
- Ray!
- Oh, my bad.

224
00:14:39,121 --> 00:14:43,247
Come on, man!
Hey, Bobby, put on some music.

225
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:45,331
Hold on.

226
00:14:45,456 --> 00:14:47,332
Here. Put this on.

227
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:53,709
-It's raining men
- Yeah, that's the shit
right here!

228
00:14:53,834 --> 00:14:56,543
-Hallelujah
- Its raining men

229
00:14:56,668 --> 00:14:59,170
- Baby.
-Amen

230
00:14:59,252 --> 00:15:03,712
-I'm gonna go out
I'm gonna let myself get
- What? It's a classic.

231
00:15:03,838 --> 00:15:07,255
-Absolutely soakin wet
- Put on the radio, man.

232
00:15:09,966 --> 00:15:12,466
Yeah! Whoo!

233
00:15:25,305 --> 00:15:28,721
- What? It was laundry day.
- What the fuck is--

234
00:15:28,846 --> 00:15:30,889
Yeah!

235
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:35,015
Whoo! Yeah!

236
00:15:38,558 --> 00:15:41,101
- Hey. Come over here.
- What?

237
00:15:41,227 --> 00:15:44,311
-Just get a little closer to me.
- Something you're gonna tell me?

238
00:15:44,435 --> 00:15:47,937
-- Bobby, what are you doing?

239
00:15:48,019 --> 00:15:50,813
I just want you to touch it.
Just touch it. Come on.

240
00:15:50,897 --> 00:15:52,856
- Uh--
-Just a little bit. Come on.

241
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,939
Whoo!

242
00:15:57,607 --> 00:16:01,567
- Ow!
- Oh, yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

243
00:16:11,446 --> 00:16:12,946
Oh, my God! Shit!

244
00:16:15,446 --> 00:16:18,864
God, Cindy--
Oh, shit!

245
00:16:30,326 --> 00:16:32,745
- Oh, my God.
- What was that?

246
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,911
I think
we hit something.

247
00:16:39,247 --> 00:16:42,039
Oh, man!

248
00:16:42,123 --> 00:16:45,999
Bobby, look at my car, man!
My dads gonna freak!

249
00:16:46,124 --> 00:16:48,834
I didn't see it.
It came out of nowhere.

250
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:51,543
- Oh, my God, we hit a boot.
- Where's the foot?

251
00:16:51,668 --> 00:16:54,043
I don't know.

252
00:16:54,168 --> 00:16:57,044
Where the--

253
00:16:57,169 --> 00:16:59,379
Its a body!

254
00:16:59,504 --> 00:17:01,462
- Oh, shit, is he alive?
- I don't know.

255
00:17:01,547 --> 00:17:03,588
- Well, check it out.
- I cant.

256
00:17:03,714 --> 00:17:06,798
- Shit!
- We have to call the police.

257
00:17:06,923 --> 00:17:09,966
- No way. I ain't going to jail.
- We have to!

258
00:17:10,091 --> 00:17:12,384
Cindy, do you know what they do
to young boys in prison?

259
00:17:12,467 --> 00:17:13,968
And all those sex-starved
convicts just

260
00:17:13,969 --> 00:17:15,468
waiting for a fresh
piece of meat.

261
00:17:15,592 --> 00:17:18,636
Hey, you're right, Cindy.
Maybe we should call the police.

262
00:17:18,761 --> 00:17:21,052
Oh, yeah, That's a great idea, Ray.
 But what about Brenda, huh?

263
00:17:21,178 --> 00:17:23,053
You think she wants
to go to jail?

264
00:17:23,179 --> 00:17:25,138
This is manslaughter, okay?
We're all gonna fry for this.

265
00:17:25,221 --> 00:17:28,973
- We're looking at 10 to 15 years.
- Shut up, Bobby!

266
00:17:29,055 --> 00:17:32,015
- Its okay. I'm fine.
-Alcohol all over.
- We're in so much trouble.

267
00:17:32,099 --> 00:17:35,057
- I'm fine.
-  -Don't blame that shit on me, Ray.

268
00:17:35,182 --> 00:17:39,184
- Look, well get rid of the body.
- Unnecessary.

269
00:17:39,269 --> 00:17:40,623
- Now you're thinking.
- We'll dump him in the ocean.

270
00:17:40,624 --> 00:17:41,977
- Not the ocean, the pier.

271
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:44,185
- Guess I'll be leaving now.
- That's a great idea.

272
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:46,312
- What about the alcohol?
- Well get rid of it.

273
00:17:46,437 --> 00:17:48,438
Come on. It'll be all right.

274
00:17:48,521 --> 00:17:50,772
- Come on. Hurry up. Lets go.
- Put him in the trunk.

275
00:17:50,897 --> 00:17:53,439
- I wont have anything to do with this!
- Shut up!

276
00:17:53,524 --> 00:17:56,982
Cindy, come on.
Well just pretend it never happened.

277
00:17:57,065 --> 00:18:00,316
You know, like the time we got drunk
and we went down on each other.

278
00:18:00,401 --> 00:18:01,922
- I'll get his arm.
- I'll grab. I'll grab his other arm.

279
00:18:01,923 --> 00:18:03,443
- I'll grab his ass.

280
00:18:03,568 --> 00:18:06,819
Well take him down to Williamson Cove
and we'll dump him in there.

281
00:18:06,944 --> 00:18:08,862
The sharks'll take care
of the evidence.

282
00:18:08,945 --> 00:18:11,029
Oh, my God,
someone's coming.

283
00:18:11,112 --> 00:18:15,031
- Oh, shit. Its Shorty.
- Brenda, take care of him.

284
00:18:21,448 --> 00:18:24,493
Shorty, I know you ain't driving
without no papers.

285
00:18:24,575 --> 00:18:27,701
I got papers,
blunts, bongs,

286
00:18:27,826 --> 00:18:30,286
all the ingredients
to make a high niggard pie.

287
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,663
- Hey, yo, can I help you?
- Yo, what's up, Ray?

288
00:18:35,746 --> 00:18:38,664
- Yo, son, you all need jumper cables?
- Nah, we're cool.

289
00:18:38,748 --> 00:18:42,498
Oh, good, cause I left
my roach clip at home.

290
00:18:42,582 --> 00:18:45,458
- Go home, Shorty.
- Yeah, I-I'll see you later.

291
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,375
Peace, Ray.

292
00:18:47,499 --> 00:18:50,001
- Get the trunk closed.
- It won't close.

293
00:18:50,126 --> 00:18:52,752
I'll do it.

294
00:19:17,344 --> 00:19:20,387
Hold on. Hold on. Put him down.
He's heavy. Oh, God.

295
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:26,306
Okay, look. On three we dump him
over the ledge.

296
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:28,848
Wait, wait, wait.
Shouldn't we at least check his wallet?

297
00:19:28,973 --> 00:19:32,599
- For what?
- Shit, he might have some money.

298
00:19:32,724 --> 00:19:35,642
We already committed murder.
We might as well rob his ass.

299
00:19:35,726 --> 00:19:37,101
- I'll take the credit cards.

300
00:19:37,102 --> 00:19:38,476
- I want his jewelry.
- I'm gonna take his drawers.

301
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:43,602
Get off!. Hey, yo, get off!.
His drawers are mine! Yo!

302
00:19:43,728 --> 00:19:47,354
- I got me a gold ring.
- Credit cards.

303
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:50,981
- All right, lets get him in the water.
- I don't think I can, Greg.

304
00:19:51,105 --> 00:19:53,524
- Its not too late.
- Shut up, okay?

305
00:19:53,648 --> 00:19:57,775
- Christ, already. I'll do it.
-Just get him in the water.

306
00:19:57,858 --> 00:20:00,776
Okay. One, two,

307
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,776
three.

308
00:20:06,945 --> 00:20:10,530
Right now we make a pact.
We take this to our grave.

309
00:20:10,655 --> 00:20:12,197
-Agreed?
- Agreed.
- Agreed.

310
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,239
- Agreed?
- Agreed.

311
00:20:14,323 --> 00:20:17,407
Say it, Cindy. Say it!

312
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:20,408
We take this to our grave. Say it!

313
00:20:20,492 --> 00:20:23,117
We take this to our grave. Say it.

314
00:20:23,242 --> 00:20:25,118
Greg, chill. Come on.
You're hurting her.

315
00:20:25,243 --> 00:20:28,244
We take this
to our grave. Ow.

316
00:20:28,328 --> 00:20:30,995
And we never
mention this again.

317
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,038
Mention what?

318
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,665
- The guy we just killed.
- Well, you just mentioned it, Greg.

319
00:20:37,789 --> 00:20:39,540
Starting now!

320
00:20:39,623 --> 00:20:41,874
Stupid bitch, man.

321
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:45,750
- God. I hate him.
- Its gonna be okay, baby.
It's gonna be okay.

322
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:50,419
I promise. Just touch it again.
Come on. Please.

323
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:56,921
- You have to move on, Cindy.
That's all behind us now.
- Exactly.

324
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:59,422
- Its a coincidence.
- Gregss right, Cindy.

325
00:20:59,504 --> 00:21:02,256
I mean, what do you think
we're in, a horror movie?

326
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:06,007
Yeah, you guys are right.
If we were,

327
00:21:06,132 --> 00:21:08,487
they'd probably cast
some dingbat like

328
00:21:08,488 --> 00:21:10,842
Jennifer Love Huge
Tits to play me.

329
00:21:10,968 --> 00:21:12,864
Yeah, or they'd cast
people in their late

330
00:21:12,865 --> 00:21:14,760
twenties, early
thirties to play us.

331
00:21:17,096 --> 00:21:20,721
-- Kenny, get the camera ready.
Here. Hold my gum.

332
00:21:22,805 --> 00:21:26,098
- Sheriff, Sheriff,
can I get a statement?
- No comment.

333
00:21:26,223 --> 00:21:31,475
Damn. Who do I have to screw around here
to get a stupid story?

334
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,976
Hey! Hey, no running.

335
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,977
Loser.

336
00:21:38,061 --> 00:21:41,061
- Slow it down!
- Blow me!

337
00:21:41,186 --> 00:21:43,438
All right!

338
00:21:43,563 --> 00:21:46,522
Hi. Gail Hailstorm.
Field Reporter, Hard Story.

339
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:48,773
Special Officer Doofy.

340
00:21:48,897 --> 00:21:52,858
Oh, hi, Doofy. Doofy, listen.
Is there a problem on campus?

341
00:21:52,941 --> 00:21:55,149
- No comment. No comment.
- Okay. Okay.

342
00:21:55,274 --> 00:21:58,944
You know, you look awfully young
to be a police officer.

343
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:01,527
- I'm 25 and a half years old.
- Ooh!

344
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:03,820
- Yeah, that's this many.
- Ah, so big.

345
00:22:03,945 --> 00:22:06,112
Yeah. That's big.

346
00:22:06,195 --> 00:22:08,822
- Well, you don't look
a day over 12.

347
00:22:08,905 --> 00:22:12,615
Except for the big head
and glazed-over look in your eyes.

348
00:22:12,741 --> 00:22:16,324
- Ooh, was that drool?
- Yeah. I forgot to swallow.

349
00:22:16,407 --> 00:22:19,825
Don't worry,
cause I never forget.

350
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:24,369
- Would you remind me
not to do that again?
- Sorry.

351
00:22:24,452 --> 00:22:27,453
Due to the recent tragedy, the sheriff
and me, your principal,

352
00:22:27,578 --> 00:22:29,996
will be questioning all students
throughout the day.

353
00:22:30,121 --> 00:22:32,997
Wow. Sounds like we've got the makings
of a serial killer on our hands.

354
00:22:33,123 --> 00:22:35,831
Yeah, I'm not supposed to say.
It's official police business.

355
00:22:35,956 --> 00:22:39,915
Hey, Doofy, what do you say you and I
go inside my van over there...

356
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,708
and, uh, get to know
each other a little better?

357
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:46,585
- Would you like that?
Yeah, that van right there.
- That van?

358
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:49,169
Yeah.

359
00:22:49,253 --> 00:22:52,754
- Yeah, okay, lets go. Come on.
- Oh!

360
00:22:52,879 --> 00:22:56,881
A terrible tragedy
and an unbearable loss.

361
00:22:56,963 --> 00:23:01,048
Its days like today
that we need prayer in school.

362
00:23:01,132 --> 00:23:06,134
It starts to unravel
the very moral fabric
of our society.

363
00:23:06,258 --> 00:23:08,467
Here you go, baby.

364
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:10,468
Go to your daddy.

365
00:23:10,551 --> 00:23:12,969
Oh!

366
00:23:13,052 --> 00:23:16,179
I'll see you after class.

367
00:23:16,303 --> 00:23:18,220
- Sweet!
- All right!

368
00:23:18,304 --> 00:23:22,139
Okay, class, who would like to give
their oral presentation first?

369
00:23:22,264 --> 00:23:25,099
- Oh!
- Anybody?

370
00:23:25,224 --> 00:23:28,224
- Yes!
- Anybody else?

371
00:23:30,058 --> 00:23:33,268
Okay, Heather.

372
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:38,228
- Okay. Can I start?
- Yeah.

373
00:23:38,353 --> 00:23:41,562
Okay, my presentation
is on the First Amendment.

374
00:23:41,687 --> 00:23:46,107
And it began on May 25, 1787 in Philly
with George Washington.

375
00:23:46,231 --> 00:23:48,106
And it states, and I quote,

376
00:23:48,232 --> 00:23:49,837
When our Founding
Fathers argued the

377
00:23:49,838 --> 00:23:51,441
passage of our glorious
Constitution--

378
00:24:41,126 --> 00:24:44,668
The First Amendment gives us the right
to say what we want--

379
00:24:44,794 --> 00:24:47,711
Oh, shut the fuck up!

380
00:24:47,836 --> 00:24:51,088
So, who's next?

381
00:24:51,213 --> 00:24:54,213
Uh, Cindy Campbell.

382
00:24:54,338 --> 00:24:57,589
Isn't she the daughter
of, well, you know--

383
00:24:57,714 --> 00:25:01,258
- Oh, yeah, you know, old Mrs., uh--
- Old Mrs. --

384
00:25:01,341 --> 00:25:04,217
Yeah. Yeah,
the one and only--

385
00:25:04,341 --> 00:25:07,718
The one and only.

386
00:25:07,843 --> 00:25:11,470
- Why, hello, Cindy.
- Hi, Principal Seuiggman.

387
00:25:11,553 --> 00:25:15,763
- Thanks, Doofy.
- Its Special Officer Doofy today,
Cindy.

388
00:25:15,887 --> 00:25:18,076
Now, Cindy, Sheriff
has some questions

389
00:25:18,077 --> 00:25:20,264
that he would like
to ask you today.

390
00:25:20,389 --> 00:25:23,891
- What is that... god-awful smell?
- I don't know.

391
00:25:23,974 --> 00:25:25,307
I got a poopie.

392
00:25:26,475 --> 00:25:29,393
Did you just say
that you went poopie?

393
00:25:29,475 --> 00:25:32,561
- Yeah. It was good.
- Mm.

394
00:25:32,643 --> 00:25:35,769
- Get him out of here.
- Yes.

395
00:25:35,894 --> 00:25:38,396
- Thank you, Doofy.
- Okay.

396
00:25:38,478 --> 00:25:40,938
You should now go back
to Special Ed.

397
00:25:41,021 --> 00:25:44,648
- Okay. Salute.
- Maybe a change of underwear, son.

398
00:25:44,731 --> 00:25:47,942
- Bye, Doofy.
- Bye, Cindy.

399
00:25:48,066 --> 00:25:50,817
- How are you, Cindy?
- Fine.

400
00:25:50,899 --> 00:25:53,818
- How are you, Sheriff?
- Bloated, constipated.

401
00:25:53,901 --> 00:25:57,485
Got a boil on my ass
the size of a walnut.
You know, the usual.

402
00:25:57,611 --> 00:26:00,486
Cindy, I want to ask you
some questions about Drew Decker.

403
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:05,030
- I didn't really know her.
- Oh, come on. Sure you do.

404
00:26:05,155 --> 00:26:07,489
No. I mean,
I didn't really know her.

405
00:26:07,614 --> 00:26:11,282
I've been in this game a long time.
Don't bullshit a bullshitter.

406
00:26:11,365 --> 00:26:14,867
Tell me about Drew. What
was she like in bed, Cindy?

407
00:26:16,076 --> 00:26:19,202
Tried to get you.
Its an old police trick.

408
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:22,870
Its an old police trick.
You didn't fall for it.
Good for you, kid.

409
00:26:22,954 --> 00:26:24,870
Hike!

410
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:28,372
Pass! Pass!

411
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:33,041
-- All right, shower up!

412
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:35,207
Yes!

413
00:26:35,291 --> 00:26:38,835
Yo, Dugan, man,
nice play, yo. Word up.

414
00:26:38,959 --> 00:26:40,918
Johnson, what a block, baby.

415
00:26:41,001 --> 00:26:44,962
Word up. Woodward. Nice ass.

416
00:26:45,086 --> 00:26:47,212
Damn.

417
00:26:47,336 --> 00:26:50,671
Yo, Greg, what's up?
You gonna hit the showers or what?

418
00:26:50,754 --> 00:26:54,923
No, man. I think I'm gonna work out,
beat the bag a little.

419
00:26:55,048 --> 00:26:59,175
Suit yourself, kid. All right.
Last one in the showers a rotten egg!

420
00:26:59,257 --> 00:27:03,176
Come on, yall!
I'm gonna get you all!

421
00:27:03,259 --> 00:27:06,260
Don't let Uncle Ray catch you!

422
00:27:29,436 --> 00:27:33,729
Who did this? Huh?
Where are you?

423
00:27:33,854 --> 00:27:36,104
This isn't funny, all right?

424
00:27:36,188 --> 00:27:39,231
A small dicks like a disability, man!

425
00:27:39,314 --> 00:27:43,564
Would you make fun of a guy
in a wheelchair? Huh? Would you?

426
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:46,066
Come on out here,
you sick fuck!

427
00:27:46,191 --> 00:27:50,150
I'll kick the shit
out of you right now! All right?

428
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:52,235
Its not the size
of the hammer,

429
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,236
its the nail
you're throwing it at!

430
00:27:56,737 --> 00:27:59,279
It's a shame how she died.

431
00:27:59,404 --> 00:28:01,655
- She was such a nice girl.

432
00:28:01,656 --> 00:28:03,905
- Yeah, she used to
baby-sit my brother Doofy.

433
00:28:03,989 --> 00:28:07,656
- He had the biggest crush on her.
- Ray, you're a dead man.

434
00:28:07,781 --> 00:28:10,200
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey.

435
00:28:10,283 --> 00:28:12,283
You wanna get
butt-naked and wrestle?

436
00:28:12,408 --> 00:28:15,660
- Bring it on, Ray!
- Hold my earrings. Where's my Vaseline?

437
00:28:15,784 --> 00:28:18,702
- Take it easy. What's the problem?
- I'll show you the problem.

438
00:28:18,786 --> 00:28:21,620
Oh-- That's you?

439
00:28:21,704 --> 00:28:25,330
They-- They turned the hot water off
in the showers, all right?

440
00:28:30,207 --> 00:28:32,790
Laugh it up, you guys.
Big laugh.

441
00:28:34,416 --> 00:28:36,917
You know what?
You can all go to hell!

442
00:28:37,001 --> 00:28:40,293
Greg, you're not the only one
who got one.

443
00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:43,753
Oh, you mean
Bobby’s got a baby dick too?

444
00:28:46,338 --> 00:28:48,963
No. I was talking
about the note.

445
00:28:49,046 --> 00:28:51,339
I got one too.

446
00:28:51,423 --> 00:28:54,215
- Somebody knows.
- That's bullshit, Cindy.

447
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:56,341
Someone just trying
to fuck with us.

448
00:28:56,466 --> 00:28:59,092
We have to call
the police, Greg.

449
00:28:59,217 --> 00:29:01,885
You call the police,
and I'll kill you myself.

450
00:29:09,178 --> 00:29:11,554
- You're hurting her, man.
- And you know what?

451
00:29:11,639 --> 00:29:13,554
That goes for all of you guys.

452
00:29:13,639 --> 00:29:16,266
That psycho wants
a piece of me, bring it on.

453
00:29:16,348 --> 00:29:19,474
But I'm not going to jail.
You got that?

454
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,977
What's everybody
talking about?

455
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:32,103
Just forget it, Shorty.
You already know too much.

456
00:29:34,937 --> 00:29:37,772
-- Aren't they beautiful?

457
00:29:39,231 --> 00:29:42,232
- Buffy!
- Contestant number one!

458
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:48,817
Very good.
And contestant number two.

459
00:29:52,736 --> 00:29:55,611
Very good.
And contestant number three.

460
00:29:55,736 --> 00:29:59,280
Buffy! That's my girl!

461
00:29:59,405 --> 00:30:02,656
- That's my girlfriend!
- Yeah, that's my girlfriend too!

462
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:06,032
- Hey, kiss my ass!
- Yeah, I'm hitting that too!

463
00:30:06,115 --> 00:30:09,117
- All right, Buffy!
- Hey, shut the hell up, man!

464
00:30:09,242 --> 00:30:13,118
- The best pussy I ever had!
- What, you want a piece of me?

465
00:30:13,201 --> 00:30:14,868
Now the talent portion
of the competition.

466
00:30:14,994 --> 00:30:17,224
Oh, you guys, I'm gonna
go downstairs for

467
00:30:17,225 --> 00:30:19,453
a closer seat. See
you after the show.

468
00:30:19,579 --> 00:30:22,497
Number three, Buffy Gilmore.

469
00:30:22,622 --> 00:30:23,935
Hey, you know what? I'm
gonna go hit the head.

470
00:30:23,936 --> 00:30:25,247
You want me to bring
you back anything?

471
00:30:25,372 --> 00:30:27,832
No, no, no. I'm good, man.
But hurry back. She's gonna perform.

472
00:30:27,957 --> 00:30:30,541
- Don't worry. I'll be back.
- Good evening, Buffy.

473
00:30:30,666 --> 00:30:32,793
And what will be
your talent for this evening?

474
00:30:32,918 --> 00:30:36,709
Acting. I'll be doing
a dramatic reading.

475
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:39,045
Yeah, yeah!

476
00:30:39,127 --> 00:30:41,170
Buffy Gilmore
doing a dramatic reading.

477
00:30:43,004 --> 00:30:46,547
Hey, do that thing from Baywatch!
She's running down the beach!

478
00:30:53,466 --> 00:30:55,508
Look out, Greg!
Look behind you!

479
00:30:57,091 --> 00:30:59,843
- Its him! It's the killer!
- Huh?

480
00:30:59,967 --> 00:31:02,886
Oh, my God!
Somebody do something!

481
00:31:03,011 --> 00:31:06,511
Somebody do something!

482
00:31:06,595 --> 00:31:08,721
He's killing him!

483
00:31:08,846 --> 00:31:11,681
- He's killing him!
- Must be an original piece.

484
00:31:11,763 --> 00:31:13,682
He's killing him!

485
00:31:13,765 --> 00:31:17,391
She's good. She's good.

486
00:31:17,473 --> 00:31:20,350
- What's wrong with you people?
- That's fantastic.

487
00:31:20,474 --> 00:31:23,768
You fucking bastards!
Why won't anyone help?

488
00:31:23,851 --> 00:31:27,311
- Amazing.
- She's the next Pamela Lee.

489
00:31:27,394 --> 00:31:29,813
Oh, God!
Oh, God! Don't!

490
00:31:29,895 --> 00:31:33,439
Greg, hold on!

491
00:31:35,023 --> 00:31:37,440
Give it up for Buffy Gilmore!
Beautiful.

492
00:31:37,565 --> 00:31:39,649
Absolutely fantastic.

493
00:31:42,857 --> 00:31:46,901
I think we have a winner,
ladies and gentlemen.
Miss Buffy Gilmore!

494
00:31:46,984 --> 00:31:49,570
Buffy, wait.
You have to go back onstage.

495
00:31:49,695 --> 00:31:51,986
- No. I have to get to Greg.
- But you won!

496
00:31:52,111 --> 00:31:55,238
- They're calling your name.
- There's a killer--

497
00:31:55,321 --> 00:31:57,655
- I won?
- They're calling your name. Go.

498
00:31:57,737 --> 00:32:00,615
- Buffy, what happened? What about Greg?
- Oh, fuck Greg. I won.

499
00:32:00,698 --> 00:32:03,449
- Congratulations!
- Oh, out of my way, loser!

500
00:32:03,531 --> 00:32:06,366
- Miss Buffy Gilmore!

501
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:08,491
Here she comes

502
00:32:08,576 --> 00:32:11,577
Miss Teen She's So Fine

503
00:32:11,702 --> 00:32:13,953
- Such lovely tits
- Give me my crown, bitch.

504
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:17,203
And a great behind

505
00:32:17,287 --> 00:32:22,288
There she is
Doggy style anytime

506
00:32:22,413 --> 00:32:26,623
And I'll do her behind
behind and behind

507
00:32:26,748 --> 00:32:29,667
Oh, there she is

508
00:32:29,749 --> 00:32:32,292
She loves 69

509
00:32:32,375 --> 00:32:34,627
There's no sign
of him anywhere.

510
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:38,502
- He could've taken the body.
- That's impossible, Cindy.

511
00:32:38,586 --> 00:32:39,879
- There's no blood. There's nothing.
Look around.

512
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,171
- I'll bet it's just
Greg playing...

513
00:32:41,253 --> 00:32:43,171
another one of his dumb jokes.

514
00:32:43,296 --> 00:32:44,797
He's gonna turn up. I'm sure of it.
He's

515
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:46,298
- probably at my house
waiting for us right now,

516
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:48,965
-you guys.
- All right, fine.

517
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:51,674
But you know what?
I'm gonna look around some more, so--

518
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,967
- You mind catching
a ride home with Buffy?
- Yeah, no problem.

519
00:32:54,092 --> 00:32:56,509
- All right, fine.
- Call me later.

520
00:33:18,058 --> 00:33:20,517
- Hello.
- Hello, Cindy.

521
00:33:20,602 --> 00:33:23,893
- Who is this?
- Its me, Bobby.

522
00:33:23,978 --> 00:33:26,478
You know, your boyfriend.

523
00:33:26,562 --> 00:33:30,606
Yeah, I'm sorry. I guess
I'm a little jumpy lately.

524
00:33:30,688 --> 00:33:33,439
- Hey, any sign of Greg?
- No.

525
00:33:33,564 --> 00:33:36,982
- Do you want me to come by?
- No.

526
00:33:37,107 --> 00:33:40,859
I'm just gonna take a bath,
and then I'm gonna go to bed.

527
00:33:40,984 --> 00:33:44,734
Okay. I’d really like
to see you, but-- I love you.

528
00:33:44,818 --> 00:33:48,237
Aw. I love you too, baby.

529
00:34:10,744 --> 00:34:12,620
Bobby, I told you--

530
00:34:12,745 --> 00:34:14,995
I still know
what you did last Halloween.

531
00:34:15,078 --> 00:34:16,787
Who is this?

532
00:34:29,791 --> 00:34:33,502
- Ow! Ow!

533
00:34:36,419 --> 00:34:39,004
- Hello.
- I'm gonna kill you.

534
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:41,587
- I'm gonna slice you up.
- Who is this?

535
00:34:41,671 --> 00:34:43,964
- I'm gonna chop you like liver.
- What do you want?

536
00:34:44,089 --> 00:34:46,506
I'm in the house.

537
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:51,466
Do you know where I am?

538
00:34:51,591 --> 00:34:55,343
I could be anywhere.
I'm like the wind, baby.

539
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:58,844
Yeah. Where am I?

540
00:35:01,178 --> 00:35:03,929
Um, you're-you're
behind the couch.

541
00:35:04,013 --> 00:35:07,640
What? How do you know that?

542
00:35:07,765 --> 00:35:09,681
I can, um, see your feet.

543
00:35:11,556 --> 00:35:15,017
Ah! Okay, turn around.

544
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,350
Close your eyes.
No peeking.

545
00:35:21,685 --> 00:35:26,021
Yeah. No. No. No.

546
00:35:26,104 --> 00:35:29,022
Hey, no peeking.
No peeking. Turn around.

547
00:35:29,147 --> 00:35:30,773
Good.

548
00:35:30,855 --> 00:35:32,939
Okay, now you look.

549
00:35:33,024 --> 00:35:35,857
Now do you know
where I am? You don't.

550
00:35:35,983 --> 00:35:40,026
No, Mr. Killer.
I don't know where you are.

551
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:43,735
I'll give you a big clue.

552
00:35:46,028 --> 00:35:48,320
Oh! I gotta stop drinking.

553
00:35:54,698 --> 00:35:56,657
- Grandma!
- Ow, baby!

554
00:35:56,782 --> 00:35:58,658
Oh, my hip!

555
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:32,627
White woman in trouble off the 744--

556
00:36:39,213 --> 00:36:42,631
Are you okay? I heard screaming.
What's going on?

557
00:36:42,713 --> 00:36:45,049
- Bobby, he was here.
- Shh.

558
00:36:45,174 --> 00:36:48,591
- The killer was here, Bobby.
- Its okay.

559
00:36:55,553 --> 00:36:59,345
- I can explain that.
- Oh, my God.

560
00:36:59,469 --> 00:37:02,304
A friend gave 'em to me.
Cindy. Cindy.

561
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:04,681
Cindy. Cindy!

562
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:07,765
Cindy! Cindy! Cindy!

563
00:37:12,641 --> 00:37:14,642
Its me, Cindy.

564
00:37:14,767 --> 00:37:17,393
Cindy, you know me. Cindy.

565
00:37:24,063 --> 00:37:26,439
I know you've had a rough night, Cindy,
so I won't keep you.

566
00:37:26,563 --> 00:37:29,355
I just want you to look at some photos.
Tell me what you think.

567
00:37:35,568 --> 00:37:37,483
Mm-mmm.

568
00:37:39,567 --> 00:37:42,527
- No?
- No.

569
00:37:42,652 --> 00:37:46,654
- I'm sorry, Sheriff.
- You sure?

570
00:37:46,778 --> 00:37:49,696
Okay, you're free to go.
Do you have somebody picking you up?

571
00:37:49,822 --> 00:37:52,738
- Yeah.
- Oh. Just--

572
00:37:52,823 --> 00:37:55,448
Just check
that one out again.

573
00:37:56,991 --> 00:38:01,910
- Mm, no.
- No? No? Well, worth a shot.
All right, thanks.

574
00:38:01,992 --> 00:38:03,305
- Guess what I just did with
those hookers we busted.

575
00:38:03,306 --> 00:38:04,618
- No way.

576
00:38:04,701 --> 00:38:07,786
All the way, man! Yes, yes.
Watch this. Doofy!

577
00:38:07,912 --> 00:38:10,162
- Yeah?
- Come on. Come on.

578
00:38:10,287 --> 00:38:11,788
Okay.

579
00:38:11,871 --> 00:38:14,789
Special Officer Doofy
reporting.

580
00:38:14,871 --> 00:38:17,373
Hey, Doofy,
smell my fingers.

581
00:38:17,456 --> 00:38:22,208
- What's that?
- That's when you know
you've become a man, Doofy!

582
00:38:22,292 --> 00:38:25,250
Hey, Terry,
smell my finger.

583
00:38:25,375 --> 00:38:28,043
- What the hell is that?
- My ass.

584
00:38:28,127 --> 00:38:30,211
- Get the hell
out of here, Doofy.
- Doofy.

585
00:38:30,293 --> 00:38:35,129
- Mom said get home now.
- Tell Mom I'm on official
police business.

586
00:38:35,253 --> 00:38:38,964
- Cindy, are you okay?
- Hey, hey, hey.
No talking to the witness.

587
00:38:39,089 --> 00:38:41,882
- Go get in the car, Doofy.
She's coming with us.
- Does Mom know?

588
00:38:42,007 --> 00:38:44,966
- Yeah, Doofus.
- Mom says when I wear this badge,

589
00:38:45,091 --> 00:38:47,467
you're supposed to treat me
like a man of the law.

590
00:38:47,551 --> 00:38:50,551
Mom also said for you
to stop sticking your dick
in the vacuum cleaner.

591
00:38:50,675 --> 00:38:53,386
Oh!
Oh!

592
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:56,052
Okay, three, two--

593
00:38:56,178 --> 00:38:58,429
- Oh, no. Gosh darn.
- What now?

594
00:38:58,512 --> 00:38:59,617
- It's just that there's all
these numbers with deci--

595
00:38:59,618 --> 00:39:00,722
- What, can't you count?

596
00:39:00,804 --> 00:39:04,139
- No, I can count,
but there's really--
- Let me make it easy for you.

597
00:39:04,264 --> 00:39:07,766
This little piggy went to the market.
This little piggy stayed home.

598
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:09,558
Now, if this little piggy doesn't roll
the goddamn camera--

599
00:39:09,682 --> 00:39:12,351
- I'm gonna put my foot
up his fuckin' ass--
- We're live, Gail.

600
00:39:12,476 --> 00:39:14,767
Gail Hailstorm standing out front
of the police station...

601
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:17,143
where I'm going to try and get a glimpse
of Cindy Campbell,

602
00:39:17,228 --> 00:39:19,729
the young girl who was attacked
earlier this evening.

603
00:39:19,853 --> 00:39:22,187
- You're on my foot, fat shit!
- Sorry, G--

604
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:24,231
- What did I say?
- Don't ever step
on Gail's shoes.

605
00:39:24,355 --> 00:39:26,231
- Why not?
- Because Gail wears Prada shoes.

606
00:39:26,356 --> 00:39:28,357
- You idiot.
- I'm a bad man.

607
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,524
Cindy! Cindy!

608
00:39:30,607 --> 00:39:32,858
- Cindy, can we get a statement?
- Buffy Gilmore, Miss Teen.

609
00:39:32,942 --> 00:39:35,859
- She's not talking.
- Is it true the police
have someone in custody?

610
00:39:35,942 --> 00:39:39,151
- Come on, Cindy.
- Cindy, your ass looks fat!

611
00:39:40,277 --> 00:39:42,069
Bitch!

612
00:39:43,487 --> 00:39:46,320
- Good shot.
- Come on.

613
00:39:46,404 --> 00:39:48,780
- All right, who copped a feel?
- Gail, it was me.

614
00:39:48,864 --> 00:39:51,530
- Oh, my God.
- It was an accident, Gail.

615
00:39:51,656 --> 00:39:54,991
I only touched it,
the top of the breast.

616
00:39:55,074 --> 00:39:56,992
- It was so tender and juicy.
- Shut up!

617
00:40:05,952 --> 00:40:09,622
- Yo.
- Hello, Shorty. What are you doing?

618
00:40:09,704 --> 00:40:14,957
Nothin'. Sittin' here watchin' the game.
Smokin' some bud.

619
00:40:16,457 --> 00:40:18,458
Are you all alone?

620
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:21,834
- Was sup?
- Was sup?

621
00:40:21,916 --> 00:40:24,752
What the--
Who's that?

622
00:40:24,877 --> 00:40:27,711
Yo, pick up the phone.

623
00:40:27,793 --> 00:40:30,837
- Was sup?
- Was sup?

624
00:40:33,129 --> 00:40:35,506
Yo, Dookie,
pick up the phone!

625
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:38,965
- Yo.
- Was sup?

626
00:40:48,051 --> 00:40:53,469
- What you doin', son?
- Nothin'... Just chillin'... killin'...

627
00:40:53,552 --> 00:40:56,179
True. True.

628
00:40:56,513 --> 00:40:58,388
So you think
Bobby did it?

629
00:41:01,848 --> 00:41:04,891
I don't know.
But he was there, Buffy.

630
00:41:05,016 --> 00:41:09,058
I knew there had to be something.
He just too perfect.

631
00:41:09,142 --> 00:41:12,476
Handsome, smart,
good in bed.

632
00:41:12,602 --> 00:41:16,603
- What did you say?
- Uh--

633
00:41:16,728 --> 00:41:20,063
Hey, Cindy.
Got your ice pack for your hand.

634
00:41:20,187 --> 00:41:22,896
- Ow!
- Sorry.

635
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:25,564
I'll get you one for your head.

636
00:41:25,689 --> 00:41:28,024
No, no, that's okay, Doofy.

637
00:41:28,149 --> 00:41:32,608
Hey, we are gonna get that guy
you dumped in the water. Yeah.

638
00:41:32,733 --> 00:41:34,734
I'll be next door
if you need me.

639
00:41:34,858 --> 00:41:38,235
Night, Cindy.

640
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:39,777
Buffy, you told him?

641
00:41:39,861 --> 00:41:42,945
The moron overheard a conversation
Greg and I were having.

642
00:41:43,029 --> 00:41:45,446
- Yeah, but what
if he says something?
- Who's gonna believe...

643
00:41:45,531 --> 00:41:48,239
a retarded retard
like him anyway?

644
00:41:48,322 --> 00:41:50,783
Cindy, telephone.

645
00:41:52,991 --> 00:41:54,866
Thank you.

646
00:41:54,991 --> 00:41:58,325
- Hello.
- Hello, Cindy.

647
00:41:58,410 --> 00:42:00,786
- Guess what.
- No!

648
00:42:00,911 --> 00:42:02,952
- You got the wrong guy.
- No!

649
00:42:03,077 --> 00:42:04,953
- Doofy!
- Its not Bobby.

650
00:42:05,077 --> 00:42:06,954
Who is this?

651
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:09,747
- Doofy! Doofy!
- Oh, my God.

652
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,418
Hello?

653
00:42:21,501 --> 00:42:26,170
I said don't disturb me
while I'm cleaning my room!

654
00:42:32,046 --> 00:42:34,547
I heard Bobby got out
this morning.

655
00:42:34,672 --> 00:42:37,924
I haven't seen him around.
Is he pissed?

656
00:42:38,049 --> 00:42:42,092
You mean since
you branded him the Candy man?
No. His heart is broken.

657
00:42:42,216 --> 00:42:45,259
Yo, son. Its like
I seen this all before.

658
00:42:45,342 --> 00:42:47,344
They had a killer at
your old high school, Shorty?

659
00:42:47,469 --> 00:42:49,344
No, it was in this movie Scream.

660
00:42:49,469 --> 00:42:51,887
Same dialogue and everything.
This is ill.

661
00:42:52,012 --> 00:42:53,887
- How did it end?
- I don't know.

662
00:42:54,012 --> 00:42:55,576
Some niggas started
shooting up in the

663
00:42:55,577 --> 00:42:57,139
movie theater, so
we just broke out.

664
00:42:57,222 --> 00:43:00,932
- No doubt.
- Okay, I say we all
just stick together.

665
00:43:01,056 --> 00:43:03,058
Tonight everyone
meet at my house.

666
00:43:03,183 --> 00:43:04,975
And bring some friends.
But don't tell everyone.

667
00:43:04,976 --> 00:43:06,767
Try to keep it quiet.

668
00:43:06,892 --> 00:43:08,268
Okay.

669
00:43:08,392 --> 00:43:13,395
Yo! Party at Cindy's house!
Drunk white women for everybody!

670
00:43:14,977 --> 00:43:19,771
Ray, if you see Bobby,
tell him I love him.

671
00:43:19,855 --> 00:43:24,065
Okay. If I see Bobby,
I'll tell him I love him.

672
00:43:31,067 --> 00:43:33,610
-Jesus!
- Its okay. It's all right.
It's just me, baby.

673
00:43:33,735 --> 00:43:36,735
- What, you don't still
think It's me, do you?
- No.

674
00:43:36,861 --> 00:43:38,945
It's just that somebody
did try to kill me.

675
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:41,238
- And the police said
I scared him away.

676
00:43:41,239 --> 00:43:43,405
- I know. He called
me last night.

677
00:43:43,488 --> 00:43:46,906
You see, it couldn't have been me.
I was in jail last night. Remember?

678
00:43:49,157 --> 00:43:51,116
You're the best.

679
00:43:51,199 --> 00:43:53,659
I'm sorry.
Please understand.

680
00:43:53,741 --> 00:43:55,159
Understand what? That
my girlfriend would

681
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:56,576
rather call me a
killer than touch me?

682
00:43:56,701 --> 00:43:58,578
- That's not true, Bobby.
- Then what is it?

683
00:43:58,702 --> 00:44:01,119
What is it?
She's gone and she's not coming back.

684
00:44:01,245 --> 00:44:03,433
- Its been over a year, Cindy.

685
00:44:03,434 --> 00:44:05,621
- But Ginger was such an important
part of the Spice Girls.

686
00:44:05,746 --> 00:44:08,956
- Oh, you gotta move on, baby.
- Oh!

687
00:44:09,081 --> 00:44:11,790
I'm sorry if my complicated life...

688
00:44:11,915 --> 00:44:15,959
is an inconvenience
to your perfect existence.

689
00:44:16,084 --> 00:44:18,918
Cindy. Cindy.

690
00:44:19,001 --> 00:44:21,085
Okay, everybody, listen up.

691
00:44:21,169 --> 00:44:23,502
Let me just say, uh,

692
00:44:23,587 --> 00:44:27,795
the killing of these teenagers
has been tragic, but, uh--

693
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,839
Hey, you know, shit happens.

694
00:44:29,921 --> 00:44:33,465
Sheriff!. Sheriff!.

695
00:44:33,548 --> 00:44:36,757
- Yes, Miss Thunderstorm.
- Have they found
Cindy Campbell's father?

696
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:38,925
- No.
- Isn't he a suspect?

697
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:41,175
That is classified information.
Where are you getting that?

698
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:45,010
I'm sorry, but my sources
are strictly confidential, Sheriff.

699
00:44:45,093 --> 00:44:47,594
Hey, Gail.

700
00:44:47,719 --> 00:44:51,012
Gail swallows.

701
00:44:56,514 --> 00:44:58,389
Watch this.

702
00:44:59,765 --> 00:45:02,683
Hello. Who is this?

703
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:04,892
What?

704
00:45:05,018 --> 00:45:07,560
You wanna kill me?

705
00:45:07,684 --> 00:45:09,853
Oh, God. Hold on.

706
00:45:09,935 --> 00:45:13,978
Cindy, its for you.

707
00:45:15,938 --> 00:45:17,896
All right,
knock it off, Buffy.

708
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:21,439
Now, as you all have heard,
there is a killer in town...

709
00:45:21,523 --> 00:45:24,858
and the police have asked us to give you
the following safety tips.

710
00:45:24,983 --> 00:45:27,149
Stay in well-lit areas.

711
00:45:27,274 --> 00:45:29,651
Do not travel alone
whenever possible.

712
00:45:29,776 --> 00:45:31,693
Always wipe front to back.

713
00:45:31,776 --> 00:45:34,318
And remember, never, ever
believe someone...

714
00:45:34,443 --> 00:45:37,695
when they tell you
that shaving your pubic hair...

715
00:45:37,778 --> 00:45:40,738
will rid you
of crab infestation.

716
00:45:40,822 --> 00:45:44,781
Now, I understand
this is a difficult time
for you young ladies.

717
00:45:44,866 --> 00:45:47,866
So if anyone needs
to come to my office to talk,

718
00:45:47,991 --> 00:45:49,992
I am here for you.

719
00:45:54,118 --> 00:45:57,411
- What a crock of shit.
- It's not, Buffy!

720
00:45:57,494 --> 00:46:00,412
He's real!

721
00:46:09,498 --> 00:46:11,375
Miss Mann?

722
00:46:13,458 --> 00:46:16,752
Come in, dear. Have a seat.
Take off your bra if you'd like.

723
00:46:18,334 --> 00:46:21,253
No, thanks.

724
00:46:21,336 --> 00:46:23,462
What can I do for you,
Cindy?

725
00:46:23,587 --> 00:46:27,755
I need to talk.
See, I have this problem...

726
00:46:27,838 --> 00:46:30,130
and I don't know
who to tell.

727
00:46:30,255 --> 00:46:34,257
- Not feeling so fresh?
- Huh?

728
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:36,759
Feminine odor and itching
got you down?

729
00:46:36,841 --> 00:46:39,967
Uh, no. No, not that.

730
00:46:40,092 --> 00:46:43,386
Then what is it?

731
00:46:43,468 --> 00:46:46,638
I have a terrible secret.

732
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:49,679
Well, Cindy, we all have
our little secrets.

733
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:55,097
Sometimes we do things
we're not so proud of.

734
00:46:55,223 --> 00:46:57,848
Some for money,

735
00:46:57,974 --> 00:47:01,433
others to gain the athletic edge
on the competition.

736
00:47:01,518 --> 00:47:04,101
Sometimes those secrets
come back to haunt us.

737
00:47:04,184 --> 00:47:06,226
- Aah!
- Do you know what I mean?

738
00:47:06,352 --> 00:47:11,019
Yes, I do, um, Miss Mann.
Thanks for ball--

739
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:15,021
I mean, all your help.
I have to go to class.

740
00:47:15,105 --> 00:47:17,023
Anytime, dear.

741
00:47:19,857 --> 00:47:23,608
- Buffy, are you coming?
- I'll catch up with you guys in a sec.

742
00:47:29,735 --> 00:47:32,653
Redrum.

743
00:47:32,737 --> 00:47:34,653
Hello?

744
00:47:41,822 --> 00:47:44,907
Somebody there?

745
00:47:45,033 --> 00:47:46,907
Hello!

746
00:47:49,951 --> 00:47:54,118
Very funny.

747
00:47:54,244 --> 00:47:56,244
Who put you up
to this, Cindy?

748
00:47:56,369 --> 00:47:58,954
Lose the cape.
Its way too '90s horror.

749
00:48:01,329 --> 00:48:05,455
Oh, so what movie is this from,
Die, Cheerleader, Die?

750
00:48:07,666 --> 00:48:12,499
Wanna play psycho killer?
Can I be the helpless cheerleader?

751
00:48:14,251 --> 00:48:16,876
Oh, so this is where
I'm supposed to beg for my life?

752
00:48:18,044 --> 00:48:21,003
Please, Mr. Killer,
don't kill me.

753
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:27,755
So is this where
I'm supposed to bleed?

754
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:31,632
Oh, look,
I'm bleeding!

755
00:48:33,258 --> 00:48:35,176
Oh, yeah,
I'm supposed to run, right?

756
00:48:35,301 --> 00:48:40,927
Okay. I'm running!
I'm running! Help!

757
00:48:41,052 --> 00:48:46,012
Help! Now I'm gonna fall
and break my leg, leaving me helpless.

758
00:48:46,095 --> 00:48:49,514
Aah!

759
00:48:49,596 --> 00:48:53,390
There you go, Mr. Scary Killer.
I'm panicking now.

760
00:48:53,473 --> 00:48:57,723
Oh, God!
Somebody please help me!

761
00:48:57,808 --> 00:49:00,017
Oh, God, no!

762
00:49:00,143 --> 00:49:02,435
No!

763
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:05,019
Oh, now what?

764
00:49:05,144 --> 00:49:10,729
I guess this is the big climax.
Hope you don't mind if I fake it. Aah!

765
00:49:13,146 --> 00:49:16,398
Oh, look at me.
I'm all dead.

766
00:49:16,481 --> 00:49:19,732
I'm a gross, scary severed head.
Come on. Please.

767
00:49:19,857 --> 00:49:23,858
Do you know who I am? I'm Miss Teen.
You're really giving me a headache.

768
00:49:23,943 --> 00:49:25,881
And you got blood all
over my Gucci sweater.

769
00:49:25,882 --> 00:49:27,818
I hope you're gonna
pay for that.

770
00:49:27,943 --> 00:49:30,403
Ah! I will not be ignored
by the likes--

771
00:49:32,029 --> 00:49:35,613
- I'm gonna jump!
- Phil, get back in there.

772
00:49:35,697 --> 00:49:37,655
- No!
- What are you doing up there?

773
00:49:37,738 --> 00:49:41,573
- Be reasonable.
- I cant take this fucking job...

774
00:49:41,657 --> 00:49:44,658
or those greasy
shit head teenagers anymore!

775
00:49:44,783 --> 00:49:50,077
- I'm going to end it all!
- Wait! Hold on!
We're getting help for you!

776
00:49:50,202 --> 00:49:52,578
Now we know Bobby’s not the killer.
So who is?

777
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:54,579
I don't know.

778
00:49:54,662 --> 00:49:55,891
Well if the killer was
in your house last

779
00:49:55,892 --> 00:49:57,120
night, why didn't he
just kill you then?

780
00:49:57,204 --> 00:49:59,163
Because he's just
messing with us.

781
00:49:59,288 --> 00:50:01,622
don't you see?
He's got us right where he wants us.

782
00:50:01,706 --> 00:50:04,332
We cant go to the police.
He's just out

783
00:50:04,333 --> 00:50:06,958
there watching us
and waiting for us.

784
00:50:07,041 --> 00:50:10,417
What are you
waiting for, huh?

785
00:50:10,501 --> 00:50:13,167
What are you waiting for?

786
00:50:13,292 --> 00:50:15,169
What are you
waiting for?

787
00:50:15,294 --> 00:50:17,878
What am I waiting for?

788
00:50:18,003 --> 00:50:21,421
What am I waiting for?
What are you waiting for?

789
00:50:21,504 --> 00:50:24,338
Fuck you!

790
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:27,423
Oh, my God.

791
00:50:27,548 --> 00:50:30,425
Ray, I still don't think
this party is a good idea.

792
00:50:30,550 --> 00:50:32,404
- You know I'm not gonna
let nothin' happen to you.

793
00:50:32,405 --> 00:50:34,258
- I just don't feel right.

794
00:50:34,383 --> 00:50:37,843
- Why cant we just
do something else?
- How about we go to the movies?

795
00:50:37,968 --> 00:50:41,678
Huh? You like that?
See a little movie, huh?

796
00:50:44,679 --> 00:50:48,514
- Hey! This is my song!
- Hey!

797
00:50:48,638 --> 00:50:51,682
- You know they gave me
a shout-out on the album, right?
- What?

798
00:50:51,764 --> 00:50:56,058
Everywhere I go
I see the same hos

799
00:50:56,142 --> 00:50:58,058
Ooh, Brenda.

800
00:50:58,142 --> 00:51:00,893
Did I tell you how sexy you look
in my jersey?

801
00:51:00,977 --> 00:51:03,561
- I do, Ray?
- Yes.

802
00:51:03,644 --> 00:51:06,771
I like it. Hey, get up.
Go over there. Let me see it.

803
00:51:11,647 --> 00:51:15,064
Ooh! Yes, I like that.

804
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:17,816
- You like that? You like that?
- Yeah. Hey!

805
00:51:17,899 --> 00:51:21,859
Hey, put this on with it.

806
00:51:21,943 --> 00:51:25,235
- Ray, you are so freaky.
- That's right. You know
I'm freaky, girl.

807
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:27,570
Go on. Pull it.
Pull it up.

808
00:51:27,652 --> 00:51:30,362
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ah, ahh!

809
00:51:30,445 --> 00:51:33,988
Yeah. Here. Put this on with it.

810
00:51:34,113 --> 00:51:35,989
Go on.

811
00:51:37,448 --> 00:51:41,700
- Are you sure?
- Go on, girl. Go on. Pull it on.

812
00:51:41,825 --> 00:51:45,117
- Okay.
- Go on.

813
00:51:46,951 --> 00:51:50,994
- I like that look.
- Ooh! I'm bad.

814
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:54,246
Here. Put this on with it.

815
00:51:54,371 --> 00:51:56,704
Go on, girl. Put it on.

816
00:51:56,787 --> 00:51:59,748
Yeah. Put that shit on there.
Come on. Just shove it on.

817
00:51:59,872 --> 00:52:03,749
Do it. Yeah.
Ooh, so fucking sexy.

818
00:52:03,874 --> 00:52:06,457
Come here, girl.
Bring your little sexy ass
over here. Come on!

819
00:52:06,541 --> 00:52:10,792
Full speed. Charge!

820
00:52:11,918 --> 00:52:14,378
Yes! Yes!
Come on! Turn around!

821
00:52:14,503 --> 00:52:16,379
Turn around! Come on!

822
00:52:16,504 --> 00:52:18,837
Yes, Brendan!
Take it, Brendan! Take it, Brendan!

823
00:52:18,921 --> 00:52:20,963
- Who?
- Uh-- Uh, Brenda.

824
00:52:21,046 --> 00:52:24,465
Put the helmet on.
No, lets role-play.
Come on. You get me.

825
00:52:24,547 --> 00:52:26,840
- Come on! Come on!
- Huh?

826
00:52:26,923 --> 00:52:28,925
I'm here at Lovers Lookout.

827
00:52:29,008 --> 00:52:31,384
Its dark,
It's in the middle of nowhere,

828
00:52:31,467 --> 00:52:34,551
and its where hormone-driven teens
love to come and fool around.

829
00:52:34,635 --> 00:52:37,928
So very likely we're about
to see someone get killed.

830
00:52:38,011 --> 00:52:39,991
Okay, sure enough,
there's a girl in

831
00:52:39,992 --> 00:52:41,971
that car, blouse
unbuttoned, all alone.

832
00:52:42,096 --> 00:52:44,471
Lets see if she'll have
a word with us.

833
00:52:44,596 --> 00:52:48,099
Hi. Gail Hailstorm,
author of the new book
You're Next.

834
00:52:48,223 --> 00:52:51,599
- Oh, yeah.
- Can you tell us your name?

835
00:52:51,724 --> 00:52:53,600
- Well, my names Heather.

836
00:52:53,601 --> 00:52:55,475
- Can you tell us what you are
doing out here all alone?

837
00:52:55,558 --> 00:52:59,935
Well, yeah, sure.
My boyfriend and I were
just, like, making out...

838
00:53:00,061 --> 00:53:02,435
and then we heard a noise out there,
so he went to go check it,

839
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:04,937
but-- well, that was,
like, ten minutes ago.

840
00:53:05,062 --> 00:53:07,271
Yeah, yeah. Has it
crossed your little mind

841
00:53:07,272 --> 00:53:09,480
that your boyfriend was
probably murdered...

842
00:53:09,605 --> 00:53:12,731
and you're about
to be slaughtered next?

843
00:53:12,814 --> 00:53:16,649
- Really? No way!
- Way.

844
00:53:16,733 --> 00:53:19,109
- Heather, good luck.
- Okay, thanks, Gail. You're the best.

845
00:53:19,192 --> 00:53:22,942
Just as I thought. The murder
is happening as we speak.

846
00:53:23,027 --> 00:53:25,694
I'm going to try and break into
the bloodshed. Are you getting this?

847
00:53:25,819 --> 00:53:29,654
Excuse me. Heather, can you tell us
what you're feeling, honey?

848
00:53:29,738 --> 00:53:33,614
Lots of pain. Gail, please help me.
Gail, please!

849
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:35,344
I'd like to help you
out, kid, but it sweeps.

850
00:53:35,345 --> 00:53:36,948
Sir, sir, can I get
a word with you?

851
00:53:37,032 --> 00:53:40,408
You got a lot of nerve coming here.
I'm just trying to do my job.

852
00:53:40,492 --> 00:53:41,930
- Get the camera off me now!
You're dead, bitch!

853
00:53:41,931 --> 00:53:43,367
- No, Kenny, keep rolling!

854
00:53:43,492 --> 00:53:45,222
I'm gonna slice your head off
and shove it up his ass.

855
00:53:45,223 --> 00:53:46,952
Get that camera off me!

856
00:53:47,035 --> 00:53:52,163
Oh, my God, Kenny!
Kenny, move your fat ass!

857
00:53:52,287 --> 00:53:55,039
Kenny! Oh, my God,
he's right behind you!

858
00:53:55,164 --> 00:53:57,705
This man is chasin' Miss Gail.

859
00:54:04,166 --> 00:54:06,126
I'm so scared right now.

860
00:54:07,918 --> 00:54:10,585
I just want to say...

861
00:54:10,711 --> 00:54:13,878
to the family of my cameraman, Kenny,

862
00:54:14,003 --> 00:54:16,337
I am so sorry.

863
00:54:16,462 --> 00:54:19,422
This was my interview,

864
00:54:19,504 --> 00:54:22,506
my story.

865
00:54:22,631 --> 00:54:24,840
Its all my fault.

866
00:54:29,717 --> 00:54:34,677
- You want some popcorn?
- Uh-uh. I brought me
a little snack of my own.

867
00:54:37,512 --> 00:54:39,845
- You want some chicken?
- Nah.

868
00:54:43,430 --> 00:54:45,952
Mm-hmm. For all yall
talkers up in here,

869
00:54:45,953 --> 00:54:48,473
it's time to keep
it down right now.

870
00:54:48,557 --> 00:54:50,308
Shh.

871
00:54:50,392 --> 00:54:52,725
Shh, back at you. Shh!

872
00:54:55,518 --> 00:54:58,602
Why they actin' already?
It ain't nothin' but the previews.

873
00:55:02,270 --> 00:55:05,312
The largest ship
the world had ever known.

874
00:55:05,438 --> 00:55:10,230
It's 400 passengers and crew on
a maiden voyage to a brave new world.

875
00:55:10,315 --> 00:55:13,275
A journey that would change
their lives forever.

876
00:55:13,399 --> 00:55:16,276
Whoo!

877
00:55:18,234 --> 00:55:22,320
I'm the king of the world!
Whoo-hoo!

878
00:55:25,070 --> 00:55:29,071
Get your ass
back down there, boy!

879
00:55:29,197 --> 00:55:32,406
- I'm gonna go to
the bathroom real quick.
- The movie about to come on.

880
00:55:32,531 --> 00:55:34,906
I gotta go to the bathroom.
Here. Take your hot sauce.

881
00:55:34,990 --> 00:55:38,033
Hurry up, man.
Don't be long.

882
00:55:38,158 --> 00:55:40,575
Back up!
Let him through!

883
00:55:41,951 --> 00:55:44,743
You can move back some.
You don't own the theater.

884
00:55:51,037 --> 00:55:53,081
--And they're off!.

885
00:55:53,163 --> 00:55:55,539
It's number three in the lead.
Number two close behind.

886
00:55:55,622 --> 00:55:59,790
And number three
is the winner!

887
00:56:01,709 --> 00:56:05,085
Number two has placed,
and number four to show.

888
00:56:05,210 --> 00:56:08,127
Next weeks Triple Crown
starts at 2:30.

889
00:56:08,252 --> 00:56:10,669
-- Be here early.

890
00:56:36,553 --> 00:56:38,930
Hey, who was that?

891
00:56:39,055 --> 00:56:42,263
Go ahead.
Do it again. Do it again.

892
00:56:54,268 --> 00:56:56,768
Anon.

893
00:56:58,769 --> 00:57:00,979
Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm.

894
00:57:01,062 --> 00:57:03,481
Mm-mmm!
Don't go in there!

895
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:12,274
Lord, I'm gonna have a heart attack!

896
00:57:12,358 --> 00:57:14,442
Man, this is
some scary shit!

897
00:57:14,567 --> 00:57:17,442
Oh, I am scared!

898
00:57:17,568 --> 00:57:23,070
- Excuse me.
- I think I paid my money like
everybody else up in here.

899
00:57:23,153 --> 00:57:26,322
- ... out of her favor--
- That ain't no man.

900
00:57:26,404 --> 00:57:29,073
- You can see her real hair right there!
- Do you mind?

901
00:57:29,198 --> 00:57:32,490
I know you better
get outta my face!

902
00:57:32,573 --> 00:57:35,367
Outta my face!
Outta my face!

903
00:57:35,492 --> 00:57:38,033
This is all me up in here.
You handle that.

904
00:57:38,117 --> 00:57:40,577
- Will you shut the fuck up!
- Yeah!

905
00:57:40,702 --> 00:57:43,911
Mmm, mmm.
This movie is good.

906
00:57:43,995 --> 00:57:48,578
Hey, baby.
You came back just in time.

907
00:57:48,663 --> 00:57:51,288
She's about to get it on
with Shakespeare.

908
00:57:51,372 --> 00:57:54,081
-She dressing like a man--
- Shut up.

909
00:57:54,165 --> 00:57:57,957
Yeah, I got you.
I got you on camera.

910
00:57:58,041 --> 00:58:00,875
You on Candid Camera now.

911
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,876
You ain't know that.

912
00:58:06,169 --> 00:58:09,920
Hello. Hey, girl.
Uh-uh. I’m in the movie.

913
00:58:10,045 --> 00:58:14,964
Shakespeare In Love.
Uh-uh. Ooh! You lying.

914
00:58:15,088 --> 00:58:17,965
For Christ’s sake,
will you just shut your trap!

915
00:58:18,089 --> 00:58:20,424
- Shut up!
- Hold on.

916
00:58:20,508 --> 00:58:23,466
I don't know why you all
is actin' I like this.

917
00:58:23,549 --> 00:58:25,092
My girlfriend already seen the movie.
She said

918
00:58:25,093 --> 00:58:26,635
they don't even stay
together in the end.

919
00:58:26,759 --> 00:58:29,260
Give me that.

920
00:58:29,343 --> 00:58:31,303
Right on.

921
00:58:32,387 --> 00:58:34,303
Will you sit down.

922
00:58:34,387 --> 00:58:36,929
Shut up.

923
00:58:37,054 --> 00:58:40,015
Your ass is grass.

924
00:58:43,515 --> 00:58:46,057
- This is for Thelma!
- And Louise!

925
00:58:46,142 --> 00:58:49,642
This is for talking
through The Fugitive!

926
00:58:49,767 --> 00:58:52,518
- You ruined Schindlers List.
-Jackie Chan movies.

927
00:58:52,602 --> 00:58:56,020
- Boogie Nights!
- And Big Mommas House!

928
00:58:59,521 --> 00:59:03,105
Aaaaaahhhhh!

929
00:59:12,609 --> 00:59:15,903
And I can not marry the daughter
of Sir Robert De Lesseps.

930
00:59:19,278 --> 00:59:23,154
Um, you guys,
there's a few too many people.

931
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:26,489
Oh, honey, please don't throw--
Hey, you guys, stop.

932
00:59:26,614 --> 00:59:28,822
Hey! Hey, please!
That's my dad!

933
00:59:28,907 --> 00:59:31,366
- No, don't touch-- Ah, no!
- Do you have more beer?

934
00:59:31,491 --> 00:59:34,617
- Do you have more beer?
- Um, yeah. Uh, check in the garage.

935
00:59:34,699 --> 00:59:36,826
No, no, no, no!
Don't!

936
00:59:58,583 --> 01:00:01,626
Kitty, you scared me.

937
01:00:05,835 --> 01:00:09,337
Horsey.
Oh, you scared me too.

938
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:16,882
Hello?
Who's there?

939
01:00:19,715 --> 01:00:22,466
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Please, don't!

940
01:00:22,592 --> 01:00:25,218
Please! I'm just a day player!

941
01:00:40,223 --> 01:00:41,765
Oh, my God!

942
01:01:09,983 --> 01:01:13,069
Chug! Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

943
01:01:13,194 --> 01:01:16,277
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

944
01:01:18,904 --> 01:01:21,447
Yeah!

945
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:26,781
Oh, Bobby. Bobby.
I was worried about you.

946
01:01:26,906 --> 01:01:29,866
I thought the killer got to you
before I could.

947
01:01:29,949 --> 01:01:31,491
Could what?

948
01:01:31,616 --> 01:01:35,243
I wanna go upstairs.
There's something I wanna show you.

949
01:01:36,743 --> 01:01:39,994
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

950
01:01:40,078 --> 01:01:42,995
- Hey, party on!
- Yeah!

951
01:01:48,497 --> 01:01:51,415
- So--
- So.

952
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:54,208
Here we are... again.

953
01:01:54,333 --> 01:01:56,375
Yeah.

954
01:01:57,834 --> 01:02:00,293
And, you know,
if you're not ready,

955
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:04,670
I'll understand.

956
01:02:04,795 --> 01:02:06,337
Bobby.

957
01:02:06,462 --> 01:02:08,420
I am ready.

958
01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:11,756
- You are?
- Yeah.

959
01:02:13,630 --> 01:02:17,257
I cant keep fighting
these urges.

960
01:02:18,467 --> 01:02:21,300
I have to just
give in to them...

961
01:02:21,425 --> 01:02:23,468
and let them flow.

962
01:02:23,593 --> 01:02:25,635
Right.

963
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:27,636
- Bobby?
- Huh?

964
01:02:27,761 --> 01:02:30,429
I have been so selfish.

965
01:02:32,762 --> 01:02:34,889
This is like a scene
from a movie or something.

966
01:02:34,973 --> 01:02:37,598
Only it isn't a movie, Bobby.

967
01:02:37,681 --> 01:02:39,600
This is real life.

968
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:43,225
Its all a movie, baby.

969
01:02:43,350 --> 01:02:45,414
There's the sound guy. There's
the script supervisor.

970
01:02:45,415 --> 01:02:47,477
How you are doin'... baby?

971
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:49,227
- Bobby?
- What?

972
01:02:50,436 --> 01:02:55,230
What I mean
is that in real life...

973
01:02:55,355 --> 01:02:57,771
you have to enjoy
each moment.

974
01:03:21,530 --> 01:03:24,323
Mmm! Ow!

975
01:03:24,447 --> 01:03:26,491
Bobby.

976
01:03:26,616 --> 01:03:29,158
Bobby!

977
01:03:32,451 --> 01:03:35,119
Can I tell you a secret?

978
01:03:35,201 --> 01:03:37,160
Sure, man.

979
01:03:38,328 --> 01:03:41,329
I see dead people.

980
01:03:41,454 --> 01:03:44,913
Man, this shit is awesome!

981
01:03:44,997 --> 01:03:47,707
Yo, son, we gotta roll
some more of that shit!

982
01:03:47,832 --> 01:03:49,748
Ah, shit!

983
01:03:49,873 --> 01:03:52,208
We don't have
any more papers, man.

984
01:03:52,291 --> 01:03:54,208
We don't have
any more papers.

985
01:03:54,292 --> 01:03:58,085
Oh, man!
What can we use to make a bong?

986
01:04:02,461 --> 01:04:04,920
Toke! Toke! Toke!
Toke! Toke! Toke! Toke!

987
01:04:05,004 --> 01:04:07,213
- Toke! Toke! Toke! Toke!
Toke! Toke! Toke! Toke!
- Yeah!

988
01:04:13,133 --> 01:04:17,342
Oh, shit, son!

989
01:04:17,467 --> 01:04:21,802
Toke! Toke! Toke! Toke!
Toke! Toke! Toke! Toke!

990
01:04:23,052 --> 01:04:26,929
This some good shit!

991
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:52,271
- Bobby! I've never done this before.
- What?

992
01:04:53,897 --> 01:04:55,773
Its okay. It’s okay.

993
01:04:55,897 --> 01:04:59,189
It's just like--
It’s like sucking on a Tootsie Roll Pop.

994
01:04:59,274 --> 01:05:02,775
- A Tootsie Pop?
- Yeah, a cherry-flavor one.

995
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:06,026
- Oh.
- With the fudge in the middle?

996
01:05:06,151 --> 01:05:08,443
Okay.

997
01:05:08,527 --> 01:05:12,028
Show me now
Show me how

998
01:05:12,154 --> 01:05:15,612
- How it feels when we're together
- Just like that.

999
01:05:15,737 --> 01:05:19,031
-I'm afraid
if we wait
-Just like that, baby.

1000
01:05:19,156 --> 01:05:21,781
- Well be waiting till forever
- Ah!

1001
01:05:21,864 --> 01:05:24,323
Oh! Jesus!

1002
01:05:26,158 --> 01:05:29,242
I never could wait
to get to the chewy middle.

1003
01:05:29,326 --> 01:05:32,284
- You know what? Let me.
- Oh. Okay.

1004
01:05:32,410 --> 01:05:33,911
Goddamn!

1005
01:05:38,829 --> 01:05:43,123
I'm flyin' solo
but don't know if I can stop

1006
01:05:43,205 --> 01:05:47,498
Don't ask me why
Don't make me lie

1007
01:05:47,623 --> 01:05:49,791
Just kick back
just sit back

1008
01:05:49,875 --> 01:05:52,000
Enjoy the ride

1009
01:05:55,293 --> 01:05:57,919
Cause I'm a spaceman

1010
01:06:00,253 --> 01:06:02,671
Guess its been a while.

1011
01:06:04,213 --> 01:06:06,423
So stay with me

1012
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:11,549
Oh! Oops!

1013
01:06:11,632 --> 01:06:13,550
Its very, uh, '70s of you.

1014
01:06:28,220 --> 01:06:32,972
Oh, yeah.
Oh, Bobby!

1015
01:06:36,058 --> 01:06:38,975
Come here, Bobby!
I want it now!

1016
01:06:39,060 --> 01:06:42,768
Oh, man,
am I fuckin' stoned!

1017
01:06:42,893 --> 01:06:44,811
Yeah, me too, son.

1018
01:06:44,936 --> 01:06:46,853
Hey, you guys hear that?

1019
01:06:51,022 --> 01:06:54,356
Oh!

1020
01:06:59,065 --> 01:07:02,233
Shh!

1021
01:07:02,358 --> 01:07:04,275
Hello?

1022
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:08,069
- Hello.
What's your favorite scary movie?
- Hello?

1023
01:07:12,111 --> 01:07:14,112
Let me talk to her. Shh!

1024
01:07:16,572 --> 01:07:18,614
I'm gonna gut you like a pig!

1025
01:07:25,659 --> 01:07:28,534
Oh, yeah! Oh!

1026
01:07:28,617 --> 01:07:30,453
Yeah! What's my name, Bobby?

1027
01:07:30,536 --> 01:07:32,703
What? Ah!

1028
01:07:32,828 --> 01:07:36,371
- What's my name, bitch?
- Ow! God! It's Cindy!

1029
01:07:36,495 --> 01:07:39,538
Whose is it, Bobby?
Whose is it, Bobby?

1030
01:07:39,621 --> 01:07:41,664
Its yours.

1031
01:07:41,790 --> 01:07:44,998
Ahhhhhh!

1032
01:07:45,124 --> 01:07:48,291
Oh, my God!

1033
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:57,170
Oh, shit!

1034
01:08:00,087 --> 01:08:02,546
Don't even contest
Cause I’ll make you undress

1035
01:08:02,630 --> 01:08:05,214
Like porn dancers
waitin' at the front door for an answer

1036
01:08:05,339 --> 01:08:08,466
Hey, yo, I'm sick of artificial MCs
like silicone titties

1037
01:08:08,591 --> 01:08:11,050
Hey, yo, check it, yo.
Fuck a cheap ball

1038
01:08:11,133 --> 01:08:13,133
I wanna smoke Cheech and Chong

1039
01:08:13,218 --> 01:08:15,677
And if I wanna fuck long,
I let my ding-a-long, hit the bong

1040
01:08:15,802 --> 01:08:18,219
And then the song,
Always pass the dutchie to the left

1041
01:08:18,302 --> 01:08:21,220
Because the right way
is wrong

1042
01:08:21,304 --> 01:08:25,013
- Whoo-hoo!
- I got one. I got one.
Here it goes. Ready?

1043
01:08:25,137 --> 01:08:27,931
I'm gonna slash and gash
Cut another hole in your ass

1044
01:08:28,056 --> 01:08:30,598
I spill blood on the walls
then play tennis with your balls

1045
01:08:30,723 --> 01:08:32,641
If the phone rings
don't answer the call

1046
01:08:32,765 --> 01:08:34,766
Gonna slit your throat
fuck you like a goat

1047
01:08:34,891 --> 01:08:37,851
Peel your foreskin off
and make a winter coat
Peace!

1048
01:08:40,310 --> 01:08:43,144
Yo!

1049
01:08:43,269 --> 01:08:47,270
That was the illest rhyme
I ever seen, son!

1050
01:08:49,313 --> 01:08:53,648
Bobby... where were you tonight?

1051
01:08:53,731 --> 01:08:57,024
- What?
- I was just curious.

1052
01:08:57,149 --> 01:08:59,066
What took you so long
to get here?

1053
01:08:59,192 --> 01:09:01,234
Why you so curious?

1054
01:09:02,818 --> 01:09:04,735
I don't know.

1055
01:09:04,819 --> 01:09:07,112
I thought it would fit
the 90s horror cliché...

1056
01:09:07,237 --> 01:09:09,862
if you turned out
to be the killer.

1057
01:09:09,945 --> 01:09:12,697
Oh, so, what? You think
I killed Buffy and Greg?

1058
01:09:14,614 --> 01:09:16,656
Buffy and Greg are dead?

1059
01:09:17,991 --> 01:09:19,699
- I thought you knew that.
- Oh, my God!

1060
01:09:19,824 --> 01:09:22,992
Bobby, turn around!
Its the killer!

1061
01:09:37,205 --> 01:09:39,123
Cindy!

1062
01:09:39,248 --> 01:09:42,332
- Oh, my God! Bobby! Bobby!
- Cindy. Help me.

1063
01:09:44,041 --> 01:09:47,291
- Bobby, its okay.
- Gimme the gun. Gimme-

1064
01:09:48,377 --> 01:09:50,960
Its gonna be okay, Bobby.

1065
01:09:52,293 --> 01:09:55,336
Yo, wait for me!
There's a killer in the house!

1066
01:09:55,462 --> 01:09:57,379
There's ass, blood
and guts everywhere!

1067
01:09:57,504 --> 01:09:59,838
Someone done gone crazy,
son!

1068
01:09:59,921 --> 01:10:04,548
We all go a little crazy sometimes.
Bobby, no!

1069
01:10:05,715 --> 01:10:07,924
Oh, shit, son!

1070
01:10:08,049 --> 01:10:10,925
Oh, my God!

1071
01:10:13,051 --> 01:10:15,426
Cindy, he shot me in the lungs.

1072
01:10:17,552 --> 01:10:19,470
You wanna hit this shit?

1073
01:10:23,722 --> 01:10:25,640
Ketchup.

1074
01:10:25,722 --> 01:10:28,056
Just like my mom puts on
her spaghetti, baby.

1075
01:10:30,224 --> 01:10:33,142
Oh, my God! Ray, you’ve gotta help me!
Bobby’s gone crazy!

1076
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:36,726
Surprise!

1077
01:10:36,851 --> 01:10:39,644
Surprise, Cindy!

1078
01:10:51,648 --> 01:10:53,732
Why are you doing this, Bobby?

1079
01:10:53,858 --> 01:10:57,483
Why? Why? You hear that, Ray?

1080
01:10:57,608 --> 01:11:00,110
I think she wants
a motive.

1081
01:11:00,235 --> 01:11:02,151
- Did Scream have a plot?
- No.

1082
01:11:02,235 --> 01:11:05,694
Did I Know What You Did Last Summer
make any sense?

1083
01:11:05,779 --> 01:11:08,529
Don't think so!

1084
01:11:08,612 --> 01:11:11,447
What about the sequel?
What was with that fat,
white Jamaican kid?

1085
01:11:11,571 --> 01:11:14,615
- I wanna kill that motherfucker.
- It was bad casting, Bobby.

1086
01:11:14,740 --> 01:11:17,240
How about this for a motive?
Lack of sex!

1087
01:11:17,365 --> 01:11:20,492
It can cause serious
deviant behavior.

1088
01:11:20,617 --> 01:11:24,160
- I thought you loved me.
- Oh, I did, baby.

1089
01:11:24,284 --> 01:11:28,203
I did. But abstinence can make you
discover new things about yourself.

1090
01:11:28,327 --> 01:11:30,828
That's right, Cindy. I'm gay.

1091
01:11:30,954 --> 01:11:33,663
And in case you haven't noticed,
so is Ray.

1092
01:11:35,330 --> 01:11:37,622
What? I ain't gay.

1093
01:11:37,706 --> 01:11:39,353
- What are you talking about?
You took me to that club.

1094
01:11:39,354 --> 01:11:40,999
- So, they play good music.

1095
01:11:41,083 --> 01:11:45,376
- What about our trip
to San Francisco, then?
- I wanted to go shopping.

1096
01:11:47,126 --> 01:11:50,711
- But you made love to me.
- No. First of all, you sucked my--

1097
01:11:50,794 --> 01:11:53,336
Whatever, Ray!
I don't want to talk about this now.

1098
01:11:53,461 --> 01:11:55,358
The point is, I'm a new
man, and I'm ready to

1099
01:11:55,359 --> 01:11:57,255
- leave all this behind
and start a new life.

1100
01:11:57,337 --> 01:12:01,506
- So you killed all your friends?
- Oh, no.

1101
01:12:01,631 --> 01:12:03,506
Just you.

1102
01:12:03,631 --> 01:12:05,883
And maybe Shorty,
but that wasn’t planned or anything.

1103
01:12:06,008 --> 01:12:08,383
But here's the genius part.

1104
01:12:08,467 --> 01:12:11,843
We're copycatting a serial killer
that already exists.

1105
01:12:11,927 --> 01:12:15,720
- Its the perfect crime, Cindy.
- But wait! There's more!

1106
01:12:15,845 --> 01:12:21,138
Hang on to your seat, baby,
cause this one’s a screamer!

1107
01:12:21,263 --> 01:12:24,514
- I'll be back.
- Uh-oh.

1108
01:12:24,639 --> 01:12:27,015
Move your big ass.
Come on.

1109
01:12:27,140 --> 01:12:29,433
Dad!

1110
01:12:29,516 --> 01:12:32,184
What are you gonna do,
frame him?

1111
01:12:32,309 --> 01:12:36,519
Nah. We're just havin' a little bit
of fun with old daddio.

1112
01:12:36,644 --> 01:12:39,811
The police are gonna find
you and daddy both dead,

1113
01:12:39,895 --> 01:12:43,604
and me and Ray are the only survivors
of maniacs revenge.

1114
01:12:43,729 --> 01:12:46,648
- You ready? I'm ready.
- You ready? I'm ready to do this shit.

1115
01:12:46,772 --> 01:12:49,231
- Come on. Come on. All right.
- All right.

1116
01:12:49,314 --> 01:12:51,649
- Come on!
- Give it to me. No!

1117
01:12:51,774 --> 01:12:54,775
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1118
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:57,110
- Ready? All right. Lets do this.
- Wait, wait. Ready.

1119
01:12:57,193 --> 01:12:58,652
- Come on. Come on.
- Ready.

1120
01:12:58,777 --> 01:13:00,319
Give it to me!

1121
01:13:00,444 --> 01:13:02,278
No! Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

1122
01:13:02,361 --> 01:13:04,236
- Remember what we talked about?
To the side.
- I know.

1123
01:13:04,361 --> 01:13:06,237
- How many times
we gonna go over this?
- Okay.

1124
01:13:06,362 --> 01:13:08,321
Stop. Just--
All right. Trust me, okay?

1125
01:13:08,405 --> 01:13:11,072
- All right. I'm ready.
- Trust me. I got this shit. Ready?

1126
01:13:11,198 --> 01:13:14,115
- Wait, wait, wait!
- I'm about to cut your throat, boy!

1127
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:16,324
Stop acting like a little girl.
Come on. Come on!

1128
01:13:16,408 --> 01:13:17,784
- You're right, you're right, you’re right.
Yeah, come on!

1129
01:13:17,785 --> 01:13:19,159
- Come on. You ready?

1130
01:13:19,241 --> 01:13:22,869
No! You guys are psychos!

1131
01:13:22,952 --> 01:13:25,161
You've seen
one too many TV shows!

1132
01:13:25,286 --> 01:13:29,537
No! Watching television shows
doesn't create psycho killers!

1133
01:13:29,662 --> 01:13:31,997
Cancelin' TV shows does!

1134
01:13:32,121 --> 01:13:34,414
The Wayans Brothers
was a good show, man!

1135
01:13:34,497 --> 01:13:39,041
It was a good-ass show,
and we didn't even get a final episode!

1136
01:13:39,166 --> 01:13:42,335
Take it easy!
I'm feelin' a little woozy here!

1137
01:13:42,417 --> 01:13:45,210
Its my turn.
Give me the knife.

1138
01:13:45,335 --> 01:13:48,295
Fuck outta here.
Ain't nobody stabbin' me.

1139
01:13:56,963 --> 01:13:59,505
Surprise, Cindy!

1140
01:14:52,441 --> 01:14:55,443
All right, all right.
Hold on a second.

1141
01:14:55,568 --> 01:14:58,110
Just give me a moment.
Ah. One--

1142
01:15:03,779 --> 01:15:05,989
Oh, yeah. That's it.

1143
01:15:06,113 --> 01:15:09,115
Ah. Okay.

1144
01:15:42,502 --> 01:15:44,710
Dad!

1145
01:15:44,794 --> 01:15:47,253
Are you okay?

1146
01:15:47,378 --> 01:15:50,254
I thought I told you
not to have a party unless I was here.

1147
01:15:50,379 --> 01:15:52,838
But, Dad, you were here.
You were in the closet.

1148
01:15:52,921 --> 01:15:56,423
Oh, yeah, that's right. Did you get some
girlfriends numbers for me?

1149
01:15:56,547 --> 01:15:59,591
- Dad, they're dead.
- Ah, you know, I cant get a break.

1150
01:15:59,716 --> 01:16:02,134
-- What's that? Is that the cops?

1151
01:16:02,216 --> 01:16:04,759
Okay, okay, listen, honey.
Help me up now.

1152
01:16:04,843 --> 01:16:07,968
Uh-- Uh-- If the cops come, tell em
I'm a plumber, okay?

1153
01:16:08,094 --> 01:16:09,970
You had a leaky faucet,
and you called, and

1154
01:16:09,971 --> 01:16:11,845
they sent me over. We
don't know each other.

1155
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:21,181
No! No!

1156
01:16:21,266 --> 01:16:23,266
Dad, Dad, put your arms down.

1157
01:16:25,725 --> 01:16:28,934
- What the hells goin' on here?
- Sheriff, it’s a bloodbath in there.

1158
01:16:29,059 --> 01:16:30,976
- He was right here! I swear it!
- Who was?

1159
01:16:31,060 --> 01:16:34,436
The killer!
The guy that murdered all my friends!

1160
01:16:34,519 --> 01:16:38,229
And the sick bastard planted drugs
all in the house there.

1161
01:16:38,313 --> 01:16:41,231
- All over the place.
- Dad. Stop it.

1162
01:16:41,356 --> 01:16:44,106
All right, Cindy.
I'm gonna have to take you
down to the station.

1163
01:16:44,231 --> 01:16:46,232
I'm cool, though, right?

1164
01:16:46,357 --> 01:16:48,315
- I'm okay?
- Lets-- Lets go, Cindy.

1165
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:50,734
Cindy. Call me.

1166
01:16:52,151 --> 01:16:54,068
Daddy'll get you out, honey.

1167
01:16:56,568 --> 01:17:00,529
Okay. Lets go over this again.

1168
01:17:13,075 --> 01:17:14,992
- You say it was an accident.
- Yes.

1169
01:17:15,075 --> 01:17:18,243
- He was on the road.
- And you think he came back
to get revenge?

1170
01:17:18,368 --> 01:17:21,203
It has to be him, Sheriff.

1171
01:17:26,788 --> 01:17:28,872
Here, Sheriff.
They wanted me to give this to you.

1172
01:17:28,955 --> 01:17:31,998
- That’ll be all, Doofy.
- Okay.

1173
01:17:32,124 --> 01:17:34,541
- I'm gonna go, then. All right.
- All right.

1174
01:17:35,749 --> 01:17:37,626
Bye, Cindy.

1175
01:17:40,834 --> 01:17:43,210
I’m sorry, Cindy.
It wasn't the man you guys killed.

1176
01:17:43,335 --> 01:17:45,045
His name was David Keegan.
Some fishermen

1177
01:17:45,046 --> 01:17:46,754
found his body a
few weeks later.

1178
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:50,296
- He's buried in Lakewood Cemetery.
- That's impossible.

1179
01:17:52,672 --> 01:17:55,048
- Then I don't know who it could be.
- He's gotta be someone else...

1180
01:17:55,173 --> 01:17:56,862
who was connected
with all the victims,

1181
01:17:56,863 --> 01:17:58,550
someone who knew
about the accident.

1182
01:17:58,674 --> 01:18:01,300
Someone who could move around
without being noticed.

1183
01:18:03,635 --> 01:18:06,760
Oh, my God.

1184
01:18:06,843 --> 01:18:10,679
She used to baby-sit my brother Doofy.
He had the biggest crush on her.

1185
01:18:10,803 --> 01:18:13,680
Its me, Cindy.

1186
01:18:13,763 --> 01:18:15,347
Night, Cindy.

1187
01:18:19,265 --> 01:18:21,348
- Doofy!
- Shit head?

1188
01:18:24,642 --> 01:18:26,559
- Have you seen Doofy?
- No.

1189
01:18:26,642 --> 01:18:28,851
- Have you seen Doofy?
Has anybody seen Doofy?
- No, Sheriff.

1190
01:18:28,936 --> 01:18:31,436
- No.
- Yeah.
Just went out the back, Sheriff.

1191
01:18:31,561 --> 01:18:33,770
Doofy!

1192
01:18:46,857 --> 01:18:50,234
He walks alone
under the big city lights

1193
01:18:50,359 --> 01:18:54,070
He always knows
just when the time is right

1194
01:18:54,194 --> 01:18:57,570
He never shows what he's thinking
He keeps it inside

1195
01:18:57,695 --> 01:19:01,405
Because he's
too cool for school

1196
01:19:01,487 --> 01:19:04,990
He comes alive
when the sun goes down

1197
01:19:05,114 --> 01:19:08,574
He gets it right
You know he's always down

1198
01:19:08,700 --> 01:19:12,158
He's got one eye open
and his ear to the ground

1199
01:19:12,283 --> 01:19:15,243
And he's too cool for school

1200
01:19:17,035 --> 01:19:20,495
He's an operator
He's a real player

1201
01:19:20,579 --> 01:19:24,121
- And if you mess with him
you know you'll never win

1202
01:19:24,246 --> 01:19:29,123
No-o-o-o-o!

1203
01:19:43,877 --> 01:19:47,504
Shit, son. Yo, what the deal?

1204
01:19:47,588 --> 01:19:50,340
Yo, if you all watchin'
this tape right now,

1205
01:19:50,422 --> 01:19:52,422
that means
I didn't make it.

1206
01:19:52,506 --> 01:19:56,342
Either I'm a prisoner,
or worse, dead.

1207
01:19:56,424 --> 01:19:58,613
But either way it goes,
I'm gonna tell you

1208
01:19:58,614 --> 01:20:00,801
all the rules to survive
this situation.

1209
01:20:00,926 --> 01:20:04,051
You gotta be quick.

1210
01:20:04,135 --> 01:20:07,470
Don't fall down.

1211
01:20:07,554 --> 01:20:12,597
Whatever you do, never look back.

1212
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:14,890
You all wish me luck.

1213
01:20:15,014 --> 01:20:16,973
Snatch and run, you all!

1214
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:22,058
Come back here, you motherfuckers!
Son of a bitch!
