1
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:13,772
Day after day...

2
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,815
The store that one might...

3
00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:21,276
I hate television.
It gives me headaches.

4
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:24,653
There's so many magnetic waves
traveling in the airspace

5
00:00:24,724 --> 00:00:27,056
because of TV and television,
we're losing

6
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:29,152
10 times as many brain cells
as we're supposed to.

7
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:31,754
Oh, please.

8
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:34,857
"The cow says blank."

9
00:00:34,934 --> 00:00:37,061
Three letters.

10
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:38,104
Dude!

11
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:40,105
"Dude"!

12
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:43,142
I don't know.
Magnetic waves, brain cells.

13
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:45,575
I don't understand the
connection between that stuff.

14
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:47,408
You know what else I heard?

15
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,745
Magnetic waves shrink
silicone molecules.

16
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:53,677
- Aah!
- Aah!

17
00:00:53,753 --> 00:00:55,812
Oh, my God!
Turn it off!

18
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:56,913
It's not working!

19
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:57,922
It's backwards!

20
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:59,253
- What do we do?
- I don't know!

21
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:01,259
Oh, my God!

22
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,457
That was kind of scary.

23
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:07,625
- I know something even scarier.
- What?

24
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,133
Have you heard about
this videotape?

25
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:11,363
Where they do it on the boat?
And then in the car?

26
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:12,427
And then in the bathtub?

27
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:15,668
He's like, "Baby, I love you."
And she's like, "Where are we?"

28
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,209
- And did you see the...
- No.

29
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:18,869
- Not that tape.
- Oh.

30
00:01:18,945 --> 00:01:20,776
The one with
all the scary images.

31
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:23,315
After you watch the tape,
the phone rings.

32
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:26,546
And this scary voice comes on
and says you're gonna die in...

33
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:29,110
Seven days. I saw that one
with Josh last weekend.

34
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:31,316
You were with Josh last weekend?

35
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:33,689
Oh, my God!

36
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:37,696
Oh, yes, I was.

37
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:39,661
Oh, you ho!

38
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:43,669
You know it!

39
00:01:43,736 --> 00:01:45,363
Oh!

40
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:48,565
Aah!

41
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,551
This is really weird.

42
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,052
Yeah.

43
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:04,215
Big house, only one phone.

44
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:08,785
Hello?

45
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,467
Hello?

46
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:21,735
I'm coming for you, my precious.

47
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:22,832
Hi, Mom.

48
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:25,400
Hi, precious.
Having fun?

49
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:28,538
Hey, ask her which bathroom has
the vibrating showerhead.

50
00:02:31,117 --> 00:02:32,516
Hello?

51
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:34,378
Hello?

52
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:26,298
Katie?

53
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:29,468
Katie?

54
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:36,308
Katie?

55
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,856
Are you okay?

56
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:52,589
Are you okay?

57
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:57,533
Aah!

58
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:21,090
Ow.

59
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:27,660
God!

60
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,644
Oh!

61
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:54,888
Whoa.

62
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:02,057
Tom, did you hear...

63
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,693
The dogs are acting strange.

64
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:27,316
Sue!

65
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:29,828
What are you doing out here?

66
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:31,454
We were worried sick.

67
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:32,759
What's wrong?

68
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,070
I wonder what they're
trying to tell us.

69
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,581
And now...

70
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:57,748
Washington, D.C.'s
leading morning news program,

71
00:05:57,824 --> 00:05:59,382
"The Morning News."

72
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:01,017
Good morning.
I'm Ross Giggins.

73
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:03,654
For our top story,
we turn now to Cindy Campbell.

74
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,061
Thank you, Ross.

75
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:07,793
There's a developing story
in Middleburg at this hour.

76
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,801
A mysterious
crop circle appeared

77
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,770
in local farmer Tom Logan's
cornfield.

78
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:16,400
Elaborate prank
or extraterrestrial phenomenon?

79
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:19,639
We'll update you as soon as we
have any further information.

80
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,942
But either way,
it's clear something strange

81
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:24,005
is happening in that small town.

82
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:25,914
Ross?

83
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:27,976
I'm sorry.
I wasn't listening.

84
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,386
Coming up, more news after this.

85
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,888
- Cindy, you got a second?
- Sure.

86
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,020
I want you to take a look at
this for that strip club exposé.

87
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:39,155
But I'd rather stick with
the crop circle story.

88
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,530
Oh, come on. You know
those things are just a hoax.

89
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:44,502
No, I'm telling you, I sense
something about that cornfield.

90
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,437
Call it women's intuition
or ESPN or both.

91
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:49,532
But I can tell
when danger's near.

92
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:50,769
Ow!

93
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:53,471
Ow!
My eyes!

94
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:56,811
Cindy, it's sweeps month.
Ratings mean everything.

95
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:59,613
People want
human interest stories.

96
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:01,118
Like the one you did yesterday.

97
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:03,018
The report
on breast augmentation?

98
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,489
It was just 10 minutes
of topless women.

99
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:07,992
I mean, come on.

100
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,459
Wow!

101
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:10,996
Why are these so interesting?

102
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:12,462
Oh, for God's sake.

103
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:14,659
People don't care about this.

104
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:18,397
They want hard-hitting stories
and in-depth coverage and...

105
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:19,699
And twins!

106
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:41,454
You think it was
the Kreisel boys

107
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:43,518
who cut that stuff
into your corn?

108
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:46,030
All I know is my crops are gone.

109
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:49,363
The bank's gonna foreclose
if I can't pay the rent.

110
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:52,768
I got 60 days
to come up with $ 1.50.

111
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,535
I'm sorry.

112
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:56,836
The last thing you needed
was more...

113
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:00,971
...hardship in your life.

114
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:02,639
Especially after
what happened to...

115
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:05,013
Sheriff, I don't need
your sympathy.

116
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:07,416
I didn't mean to upset you,
Father.

117
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,615
Please.
I'm not a minister anymore.

118
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:14,285
I lost my faith
that terrible night.

119
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,952
Your faith will return.

120
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:18,929
Just as sure
as the sun will rise.

121
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,363
Sounds like a long shot.

122
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:22,697
Look, there's always
an explanation

123
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:24,895
for all this so-called
phenomena.

124
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,199
Maybe you're right.

125
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:28,467
It was probably
just the Kreisels.

126
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,304
And when I get through
with them,

127
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:32,810
I doubt you'll be seeing
anything strange on this farm

128
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,210
for a long time.

129
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,214
You'll see.

130
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:40,777
You all right, Tom?
Get some rest.

131
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:49,091
George!

132
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,525
George!

133
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:58,661
I need you back here tomorrow
night after you pick up Sue.

134
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:00,000
That tractor needs fixing.

135
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:03,235
Sorry, dawg. I can't help you.
I have to get ready for my show.

136
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:06,301
Not that stupid
hip-hop stuff again.

137
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,847
Damn it, when are you going to
do something with your life?

138
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:09,677
I got a dream!

139
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:11,979
- What is your dream?
- To have a dream.

140
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:15,748
George, all you've done
is chase adolescent fantasies.

141
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:17,914
"I want to be an astronaut.
A cowboy.

142
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,753
Gynecologist to the stars."

143
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:21,622
And now this stupid
hip-hop thing.

144
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:22,752
For your information,

145
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:25,296
this hip-hop thing is gonna
get me paid.

146
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:27,025
I'm gonna win that rap battle.

147
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:29,294
Rap battle?
Oh, for God's sake.

148
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:32,428
You just hate me
'cause I'm black.

149
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:33,995
You don't have any faith in me.

150
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,064
You don't have any faith
in anything anymore.

151
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:37,939
So why don't you just worry
about you,

152
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,979
and I'll worry about...
Aah!

153
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:59,594
Cody!

154
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:02,534
You're late again, Aunt Cindy.

155
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,695
I'm sorry.
I was stuck in traffic.

156
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:05,794
Cindy!

157
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:07,395
Brenda, hi!

158
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:10,306
Oh, it's great to see you!

159
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:12,503
Oh, it's been so long.

160
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:15,376
Oh, too long.
I've been working so hard.

161
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,643
I've had to spend more
and more time at the station.

162
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:20,584
The news just keeps coming in.

163
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:22,314
What was the assignment?

164
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:24,083
Draw your family and friends.

165
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:25,487
Oh.

166
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:27,185
Anyone new in your life, Cindy?

167
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:30,592
Well, you know, I just haven't
found the right guy.

168
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:33,257
I'm looking for something more
than just good sex.

169
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:34,890
I know.
You want commitment.

170
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,629
No, I want great sex.
And when I meet that guy...

171
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:40,171
That's what I'm talking 'bout!

172
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:42,730
You want a guy that's like,
bam, bam, bam!

173
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:45,038
You know what I'm saying?

174
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:47,375
Did I say stop drawing?

175
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:50,415
Look, when I meet Mr. Right,
I'll know.

176
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,250
Uncle George!

177
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,549
Hey, sweetie!
Come here!

178
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:57,248
How are you?
Oh!

179
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:00,053
Mmm!
Go get your stuff, okay?

180
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:02,587
I know you.

181
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,755
You're Tom Logan's brother.

182
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,264
And you're that reporter,
Cindy Campbell.

183
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,665
You did the story
on our cop cycles.

184
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:10,929
Crop circles.

185
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,561
Right.

186
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:15,366
So, you're here
to pick up your...

187
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:16,908
Nephew, Cody.

188
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:18,807
You don't dress like a farmer.

189
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:20,470
My brother's the farmer.

190
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:22,275
I'm the rapper.

191
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,213
- Hmm.
- Oh, for real.

192
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:25,910
And here's the 6-1-1 on that.

193
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:29,546
That's phone repair.
You mean 4-1-1.

194
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:30,611
Right.

195
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:34,456
So, I'll be doing the rap battle
at the 23 Club tomorrow night.

196
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,892
Oh, I don't believe this shit.

197
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:38,225
Word!
You two should come down!

198
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:39,594
I'll be rappin',
I'll be cappin',

199
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:41,428
I'll be tappin',
I'll be flappin',

200
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,730
I'll be happen-ing.

201
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:45,771
Ding, bing, wing.

202
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:47,772
- Yo!
- Sounds good!

203
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,102
Would, could, should, 'hood.

204
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:51,473
- Ugh!
- Gug, mug, dug, bug.

205
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:55,071
If we say we'll come,
will you shut your ass up?

206
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:57,411
Okay, then.
Fresh.

207
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:59,075
I'll see you guys
tomorrow night.

208
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:00,584
Okay. Bye.

209
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:01,779
Peace out.

210
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,956
Now, who the fuck did that?

211
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,131
Honey, what is it?

212
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:17,567
Are you having
one of your visions?

213
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:20,537
There's a girl...
with black hair.

214
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:23,040
She wants to kill you.

215
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:27,671
Your period starts
in three... two... one.

216
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,272
What else?
Cody, what else do you see?

217
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:33,011
I see a little boy
and a grown woman.

218
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,017
But no father.

219
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,314
Oh, Cody.

220
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:37,287
I see you kneeling in dog shit.

221
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:39,551
What? Ugh!

222
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:42,185
Oh, for God's sake.

223
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,853
Cody, don't you understand?

224
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:46,989
As long as we have each other,
that's all we need.

225
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:49,796
I know things have been tough
for you since your mom died.

226
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:54,135
God, I have been so selfish.
Always putting my career first.

227
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:57,369
From now on, I'm gonna be
thinking about you 24...

228
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:00,212
Damn!

229
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,975
Wait, Cindy!
Wait!

230
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:06,407
Aah!

231
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:21,798
Honey, I'm gonna be
leaving soon, so...

232
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:37,214
Do you know who she is?

233
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:38,944
No.

234
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:41,316
But sometimes she talks to me.

235
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:43,116
She's coming tonight.

236
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:57,697
Oh, Father Muldoon.

237
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,135
Cindy.

238
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:01,196
I'm so grateful you could come.

239
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:03,173
I've called all over
for babysitters.

240
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:06,302
I don't mind filling in
now and then.

241
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:08,437
Where is little Cody?

242
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,782
I don't know.

243
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,785
He must be back in his room,
playing.

244
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,720
Anyway, I left a number where
I can be reached on the table.

245
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:19,553
Also, he has a little rash
on his behind.

246
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,820
So make sure he takes a bath.

247
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:24,362
Thank you, Father.
Good night.

248
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:28,589
Cody?

249
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:42,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's getting thick up in here.

250
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:45,342
Hey, look, before we get on
with the battles tonight,

251
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:47,180
I got a couple announcements
to make.

252
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:49,346
I know y'all want to bust a cap
in the air

253
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:50,615
for your favorite rapper.

254
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:53,817
But if you could please hold on
to your gunfire

255
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,861
until the end of the show.

256
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:58,855
Let's just put the safeties on.

257
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:01,957
It's on the left side of the gun
above the trigger guard.

258
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,471
Will somebody get his ass
out of here?

259
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:10,770
All right.
Deejay, spin that shit!

260
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,961
Whoa!
My bad.

261
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:34,693
Mother...

262
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:41,066
Brenda, is something wrong?
You look scared.

263
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:44,166
I don't know. All that stuff
you was saying on TV...

264
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:47,178
I just got a weird feeling
something bad is heading my way.

265
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:49,043
Like when you see
an Asian person

266
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,411
behind the wheel of a car.

267
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:54,145
Cindy, after the show, you think
you could come back to my crib

268
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:55,481
and hang out with me?

269
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:56,987
I don't want to be alone.

270
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:58,990
Oh, of course I will, Brenda.

271
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:01,026
Oh, I love you.

272
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:03,561
Pay my way, okay?

273
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,096
Yo, yo, yo, George!

274
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:07,359
What's up with the man
with the tightest rap game

275
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:08,866
on the streets, baby?

276
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:10,526
- What's good with you, boy?
- Dude!

277
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:12,365
What's good, baby?

278
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:15,236
Finally, the white man is gonna
school the black man

279
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,239
on how to rap.

280
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,435
- Yeah!
- Yeah. Yeah, I guess.

281
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,205
How many people are here,
you think?

282
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,246
I don't know, man.

283
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:24,339
100, 200 whitey-hating,
chrome-packing,

284
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,179
ready to bust a cap
in any white boy's ass

285
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:28,719
- who ain't bringing that shit.
- Yeah. At least. Yeah.

286
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:29,754
Mm-hmm.
Word.

287
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,017
What's wrong, George?

288
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:34,423
You ever wonder when it's time
to stop living up here

289
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,154
and start living down here?

290
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:40,028
No, but what if we stop living
over here and move over there?

291
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:42,192
My Aunt ShaNeequa used to live
over there, man.

292
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:43,359
But that bitch got evicted.

293
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:45,096
- Word? What for?
- I'm dead serious.

294
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,331
- Mice.
- Mice? I thought she had rats.

295
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:49,306
No, man. Rats are outside.
Mice are inside.

296
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,570
What if a mouse goes outside?
Does it become a rat?

297
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:53,304
If a rat is in the house,
is it a mouse?

298
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:55,540
I ain't never seen
no mouse outside.

299
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:56,945
That's because it's a rat, fool!

300
00:16:57,016 --> 00:17:00,281
Damn, you might have just made
a fact just now.

301
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,479
Fellas, what are you guys
talking about?

302
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:04,078
Yo, George, you need something?

303
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:06,386
'Cause I will do anything
for you.

304
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:08,286
Anything.

305
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,720
Well, about those
chrome-packing,

306
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:13,287
whitey-hating gangsters,
perhaps...

307
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,629
- What he need is a hype man.
- Word!

308
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:18,800
You can be his Spliff Star.

309
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:19,963
That's me.
That's what I do.

310
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,904
That's my job, baby!
That's what I do!

311
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:23,407
You know that.
Goddamn.

312
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:25,936
I'm cool.
That's what I do.

313
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:29,105
When you a hype man,
you take them hits.

314
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,252
All right, all right, all right!
That was hot!

315
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:44,693
That's what I'm talking about.
That was hot, right?

316
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:46,924
Right?
Yo, what do we think?

317
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:52,832
I thought you were both
absolutely dreadful.

318
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:53,997
Ghastly.

319
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:54,937
What?

320
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:57,032
I don't know
what I'm doing here.

321
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:59,942
This club is totally pathetic.

322
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:12,424
You ready, George?

323
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:14,220
- It's showtime, baby.
- Okay.

324
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:16,352
I just want to let you know
no matter what goes on

325
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,589
on that stage tonight...

326
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:20,695
you'll always be in my heart.

327
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,734
Oh, that's love.
That's love right there.

328
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:25,326
- I love you.
- That's what I'm talking about.

329
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,306
I love you, man.
Can you feel it?

330
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,366
Can you feel my love
on your hip?

331
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:33,376
Can you feel it?

332
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,605
I can't get around!

333
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,671
Come on, dawg!
That's what I'm talkin' about!

334
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:39,216
You go out there and you
rip it tonight. All right, man?

335
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,979
You do your thing tonight,
all right?

336
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:42,714
- Okay. Cool.
- We shouldn't have to do that.

337
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,016
We love each other.

338
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:45,147
I'm gonna go bring you on.

339
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:46,691
Let's do it, baby.
We hyped!

340
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,691
Yeah.
All right, all right.

341
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,422
Y'all ready
for the next throwdown?

342
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:54,591
To my left, we have
the reigning champion.

343
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,964
Hailing from Fort Apache
in the Bronx.

344
00:18:57,035 --> 00:18:58,366
BX!
What? What? What?

345
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:01,167
Some of y'all call him
"Jealous Ones Still Envy."

346
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,107
Some of y'all call him
the Don Cartagena!

347
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:06,235
Some of y'all call him
Joey Crack.

348
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,073
Stick 'em up!

349
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:11,276
But, tonight, let's give it up
for Fat Joe!

350
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,710
I got to go against him?

351
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:16,447
Give it up!
Give it up!

352
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:18,456
What you think,
they're here to see Fat Joe?

353
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:20,515
Joe! Joe! Joe!

354
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:22,753
No, man, they're saying,
"Go! Go! Go!"

355
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:26,860
Now my challenger.
Whoo!

356
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:28,456
He's a farmer rapper.

357
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:31,469
So you know he been kicking
the shit all day!

358
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:33,903
Let's give it up
for my man, George!

359
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:36,532
That's what I'm talking about!
Yeah! Yeah!

360
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:39,441
Come on, everybody!
Put your hands...

361
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:42,036
That's right.
Okay, Joey Crack.

362
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:45,345
You're the reigning champion,
so you get to spit first.

363
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:47,214
Yo, deejay, spin that shit!

364
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:51,379
These guys can't be serious
right here.

365
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:41,666
Oh! Okay, let's go!
Wait a minute!

366
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,935
Whoo! All right!

367
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:45,306
All right!
That was hot!

368
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:47,436
That was tight, Fat Joe.
Yo!

369
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:51,710
Now everybody give it up
for my man, George!

370
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:53,444
Deejay, spin that shit!

371
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:56,009
Whoo!

372
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,488
Come on! Come on!
Everybody!

373
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,880
- Check it out.
- Go! Go! Go!

374
00:22:02,954 --> 00:22:04,444
Whoo!

375
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:08,055
That's what I'm talking about!

376
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:11,755
Give it up for George!

377
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,957
That's my boy right there!
That's what...

378
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:15,624
Oh, shit.
Ooh.

379
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,273
George! George!
The hood!

380
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,603
Lose the hood!

381
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:26,200
- I know. We're in the 'hood now!
- No, man!

382
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:27,802
He's a dead man.

383
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:30,404
You guys feeling me?
In the 'hood?

384
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,614
Whoa! Whoa!

385
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,517
Aah!

386
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:39,857
That's it.
I'm done.

387
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:42,393
Oh, man, you can't give up rap
just like that.

388
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:43,985
Rap shmap.

389
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:46,724
Look! You still got it!
See?

390
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:50,200
Thanks for coming over
tonight, Cindy.

391
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:52,759
I guess I'm just going through
a rough time.

392
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:57,036
Brenda, you want to tell me
what's really bothering you?

393
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:01,946
Well, there's something
I need to...

394
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:03,674
I saw a tape.

395
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:05,842
I think you should know
about it.

396
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:08,818
It had these really
shocking images, Cindy.

397
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:11,447
Brenda, it was Mardi Gras.

398
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:14,651
I never drank vodka before,
and I was out of beads!

399
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,694
No, not that tape, Cindy.

400
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:18,992
Well, I guess it's just
an urban legend.

401
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,362
You watch it.

402
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:23,867
And as soon as it's over,
your phone rings

403
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:25,368
and a creepy voice says...

404
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:28,031
"You're gonna die in seven days."

405
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:31,132
And seven days later...

406
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:32,608
When did you watch it?

407
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:34,770
A week ago.

408
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:36,313
A week ago tonight.

409
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:38,144
Brenda.

410
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,616
Oh, my God!

411
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:46,782
Oh, Brenda!

412
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,493
Brenda!
Oh, my God!

413
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:54,728
Oh! Oh!

414
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,995
Oh, my God!
You bitch!

415
00:23:57,068 --> 00:23:58,501
Ketchup!

416
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:01,733
You should have seen
the look on your face!

417
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:04,038
You got me!

418
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:09,307
Brenda? Brenda?

419
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:11,076
Oh, my God, Brenda!
Brenda?

420
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:23,987
I can't believe you fell
for that fake seizure!

421
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:25,427
But it seemed so real!

422
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:27,829
- It did, didn't it?
- And you peed!

423
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:31,062
Yeah! I really sold
that shit, didn't I?

424
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:34,534
I just love the look on
your face when you are scared!

425
00:24:34,606 --> 00:24:36,198
Girl, you are too easy.

426
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:38,071
- Aah!
- Aah!

427
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:46,984
I got you
with the old fake hand!

428
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,284
Ooh!

429
00:24:49,354 --> 00:24:50,685
Girl, you were scared!

430
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:52,120
Well, I know!

431
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,055
Oh, come on.
I was just kidding.

432
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:56,252
Well, you've taken it
too far, Brenda.

433
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:59,263
I'm gonna go get
the rest of the popcorn.

434
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:06,899
Cindy?

435
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:09,566
Oh, forget it.
I am not falling for it again.

436
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:28,716
Oh, come on.

437
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:30,818
Cindy, the news is on.

438
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:33,956
Another little white girl
done fell down a well.

439
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:36,694
50 black people get their
ass beat by police today,

440
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,292
but the whole world got to stop

441
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,964
for one little whitey
down a hole.

442
00:25:45,176 --> 00:25:46,734
Cindy!

443
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,371
The TV's leaking!

444
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:53,911
Cindy?

445
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:56,419
Cindy, something's wrong here.

446
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:15,862
Cindy, this bitch
is messing up my floor!

447
00:26:19,377 --> 00:26:21,368
Cindy, help me!

448
00:26:21,446 --> 00:26:22,936
I'm not listening.

449
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,215
Get up, you little ugly bitch,

450
00:26:27,285 --> 00:26:28,980
Come on!
Let me see what you got!

451
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:32,023
What you gonna do?
That's all?

452
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:34,518
Ooh!

453
00:26:35,226 --> 00:26:38,059
Ooh!
I'm whipping her ass, Cindy!

454
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:39,494
Yeah!
What's up?

455
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:43,027
Ooh!

456
00:26:51,576 --> 00:26:53,305
Aah!

457
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:56,176
Cindy, please help me!

458
00:26:56,247 --> 00:26:58,272
Cindy!

459
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,545
Okay.
Hang on a second.

460
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:01,551
Hello?

461
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,180
Father Muldoon here.
We're getting along famously.

462
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:06,348
Thanks again, Father.
Bye-bye.

463
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:08,119
Brenda?

464
00:27:08,693 --> 00:27:10,251
Brenda?

465
00:27:12,897 --> 00:27:14,558
Brenda?

466
00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:22,570
Aah!

467
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:29,004
Oh, my God.

468
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,672
Yes. Yes.
Of course I'll tell her.

469
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:32,376
Thank you.

470
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:36,045
Sue's teacher, Brenda.

471
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:37,053
She's...

472
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:38,054
She's dead.

473
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:40,717
Oh.
I better tell her.

474
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:42,885
No, no, no.
I can do it.

475
00:27:48,566 --> 00:27:49,726
Sue?

476
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:51,735
Yes?

477
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:54,135
You know your teacher,
Miss Brenda?

478
00:27:54,205 --> 00:27:54,967
Yeah.

479
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,235
- She's dead!
- Aah!

480
00:27:57,308 --> 00:27:58,570
Gone forever!

481
00:27:58,643 --> 00:28:00,907
Died a horrible, painful death!

482
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:03,607
Gone, gone, gone,
just like your dog!

483
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:04,979
My dog's dead?

484
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:08,577
I just ran him over with the car
when I drove in!

485
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:11,281
Everyone you love around you
is dying!

486
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,790
- Aah!
- Aah!

487
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:22,559
Hello, Father.

488
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:24,602
Don't call me Father.

489
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:27,160
I haven't been
a clergyman since...

490
00:28:29,607 --> 00:28:32,576
I'm sorry about that night.

491
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:34,407
If I hadn't fallen asleep
while driving

492
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:37,073
for that exact 20 minutes.

493
00:28:37,148 --> 00:28:40,640
If I hadn't drank that exact
whole bottle of Jägermeister.

494
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:43,745
If only I hadn't killed
that hooker.

495
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:45,619
Sayaman.

496
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:47,954
I don't see what any of this
has to do with Annie.

497
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:50,893
I'm sorry.
Those were other nights.

498
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:55,865
But if it had been that night,
I might have missed her.

499
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:57,367
That terrible night.

500
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:19,222
It's your wife, Father.

501
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:20,814
She's hurt.

502
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:21,688
Annie?

503
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,854
She was hit by a truck,
and she's pinned against a tree.

504
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:25,987
I don't understand.

505
00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:30,000
As long as the truck has her
pinned, she'll stay alive.

506
00:29:30,068 --> 00:29:31,899
I still don't get it.

507
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,742
This is your wife.

508
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,103
She broke her wiener?

509
00:29:44,983 --> 00:29:48,578
Look what happens to the taco.

510
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:52,886
Look, I don't understand
all this fancy medical lingo.

511
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:54,788
I want to see Annie.

512
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,924
She's split in half.

513
00:29:57,996 --> 00:30:02,660
You mean like down-the-middle
in half?

514
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:03,860
At the waist.

515
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:08,304
You mean this is the last time
I can talk to the top half?

516
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:09,897
Yes.

517
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:13,535
The truck is the only thing
that is holding her together.

518
00:30:13,611 --> 00:30:17,172
Let's say this is
her bottom half.

519
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:20,046
Can I squeeze in
a few minutes with that?

520
00:30:20,118 --> 00:30:23,144
I'm not sure what you mean.

521
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:25,849
- Let me explain.
- Tom.

522
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:27,585
Go to her.

523
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:38,358
Tom, I'll need a ride home.

524
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:44,737
Hey, baby.
How's it going?

525
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:47,573
Oh, I'm dying, Tom.

526
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:49,442
Don't talk like that.

527
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:52,176
The truck barely hit you.

528
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,309
Honey.

529
00:30:54,385 --> 00:30:56,910
Kiss me one last time.

530
00:30:59,757 --> 00:31:02,885
Promise me you'll never remarry.

531
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:05,327
I promise.

532
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:07,830
And no sex, either.

533
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:10,731
I'm sorry.
I didn't catch that.

534
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:12,167
No sex.

535
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:14,364
Honey, you're not
speaking clearly.

536
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:16,270
- Your injuries must be awful.
- No sex.

537
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:19,902
Oh, cruel fate to shroud my
wife's dying words in mystery.

538
00:31:19,978 --> 00:31:21,912
- No sex!
- Poor Annie.

539
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,106
We hardly knew her.

540
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:25,615
- She'll be missed terribly.
- Oh, Jesus.

541
00:31:25,683 --> 00:31:27,548
That's right, honey.
Go into the light.

542
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:28,711
Look!

543
00:31:28,786 --> 00:31:31,584
Just tell George, swing away.

544
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:33,487
Right.
Swing away.

545
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:36,118
Oh, sure.
That you understand.

546
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:40,787
Annie?
Annie!

547
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,434
I'm sorry, dude.

548
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:46,129
Don't call me dude.

549
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:48,638
I'm not a stoner anymore.
Not since...

550
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:52,434
Goodbye, Tom.

551
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,194
I'm so sorry,
Mr. And Mrs. Meeks.

552
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:14,026
Brenda was a good friend
when she was alive.

553
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:16,225
My sweet, sweet Brenda.

554
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:18,531
She looks so peaceful.

555
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,161
Oh...

556
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:26,738
If only God had taken us
instead of our daughter.

557
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:29,279
And knowing your Brenda
like I did,

558
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:31,838
I'd say she wishes
the same thing.

559
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:35,177
These just came today.

560
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:37,915
Photos from a trip she took.

561
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:42,381
They're blank.

562
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,985
Turn them around, honey.

563
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:46,257
Oh.

564
00:32:46,331 --> 00:32:48,561
Yes, of course.

565
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:49,759
Who's this?

566
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:52,860
That's Ralph.
He's right over there.

567
00:32:58,843 --> 00:32:59,832
Cody?

568
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:03,711
It's a boy.
He's going to be an asshole.

569
00:33:03,781 --> 00:33:07,239
Smoke all you want.
You're gonna get hit by a bus.

570
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:10,287
That's not fooling anyone.

571
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:13,015
Cindy.

572
00:33:13,091 --> 00:33:14,422
- George.
- Hey.

573
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:17,290
Sue wanted to pay her respects
to her teacher.

574
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:19,221
You?

575
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:20,696
Brenda was my bitch.

576
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:21,789
Of course.

577
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:24,858
Hmm.

578
00:33:24,936 --> 00:33:26,028
Are you okay?

579
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:28,629
It's just the open coffin.

580
00:33:28,706 --> 00:33:30,799
I can't believe they leave it
out here like this.

581
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:32,866
- George, it's a wake!
- Awake?!

582
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:35,037
- Brenda! It's a miracle!
- No! George, stop!

583
00:33:35,113 --> 00:33:36,444
I thought you were dead!

584
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:39,745
Sue, your teacher's alive!
Hello?!

585
00:33:39,817 --> 00:33:43,014
I got your back, George!
I got your back!

586
00:33:43,087 --> 00:33:44,076
She's alive!

587
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:45,622
I'll tell you what!

588
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,681
Oh!

589
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:51,218
Mahalik!
She's alive! Brenda!

590
00:33:51,295 --> 00:33:52,557
George, stop!
She's dead!

591
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:54,222
No!
We won't lose you again!

592
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:56,630
Mahalik, help!

593
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:57,895
Nothing!

594
00:33:57,969 --> 00:33:59,994
Ooh!

595
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,506
She's not breathing!

596
00:34:02,573 --> 00:34:03,437
No!

597
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:05,601
Live, damn it!
Live!

598
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,778
Live, damn it!
Live!

599
00:34:10,248 --> 00:34:11,806
Let me open her windpipe!

600
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,942
No! Oh, God!

601
00:34:14,018 --> 00:34:15,485
Charles!
Charles, stop them!

602
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:17,350
Breathe!

603
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:22,154
Someone stop them!
What are they doing?!

604
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:23,818
Get up!

605
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,954
She's alive!
She's alive!

606
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:28,828
Wake up!
Breathe!

607
00:34:38,009 --> 00:34:40,705
- Charles! Charles!
- Clear!

608
00:34:40,778 --> 00:34:42,803
No!

609
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:47,217
Aah!

610
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:49,344
I got something!
I got something!

611
00:34:55,326 --> 00:34:56,793
Aah!

612
00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:58,158
- That's it!
- George!

613
00:34:58,229 --> 00:35:01,096
That's the last time I try to
bring anyone back from the dead.

614
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:03,224
George, don't get down
on yourself.

615
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:05,235
I know you were only trying
to help.

616
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:08,363
You're a good, caring person.

617
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,634
Which is why I like you.

618
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:12,039
Oh, thanks, Cindy.

619
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,305
But I don't want to
screw your life up, too.

620
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:16,369
The most caring thing I could do
for everyone right now

621
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,039
is to just get out of here.

622
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:21,142
George!
What about Sue?

623
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:24,114
Oh, yes.
Of course.

624
00:35:24,188 --> 00:35:25,951
Once I get Sue, then...

625
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:27,217
Wait!

626
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:32,094
I could really use a friend
right now.

627
00:35:34,832 --> 00:35:38,324
Brenda's gone.
Cody resents me.

628
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:42,365
And I'm caught up in something
I can't even...

629
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,601
Oh, God, it's so hard!

630
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:49,169
Well, you're beautiful and
you're pressing up against me.

631
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:53,116
Look, Cindy.

632
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:56,051
I know you'd never consider
going out with a guy like me.

633
00:35:56,120 --> 00:36:00,489
But if you're not too busy
tomorrow night...

634
00:36:02,426 --> 00:36:04,656
Is that a yes?

635
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:06,094
Yes.

636
00:36:11,536 --> 00:36:15,302
Cindy, did Brenda
ever talk to you about a tape?

637
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:17,273
She did mention something.

638
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:19,571
Do you mind if I go upstairs
and look around?

639
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:21,908
Yes, go.
Of course. Go.

640
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:25,073
Cody, I'll be right back, okay?

641
00:36:25,149 --> 00:36:27,344
You're getting lucky tonight.

642
00:36:27,418 --> 00:36:29,943
He doesn't know you're a guy.

643
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,241
Oh, shit.

644
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:12,111
Hello?

645
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:16,125
What?
Willie Mays?

646
00:38:17,695 --> 00:38:19,629
Who's gay?
Hello?

647
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:22,454
What?

648
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:23,966
Can you hear me now?

649
00:38:24,035 --> 00:38:25,127
Kind of.

650
00:38:25,202 --> 00:38:27,136
- Can you hear me now?
- Yes. Perfect.

651
00:38:27,204 --> 00:38:28,466
Seven days.

652
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:29,972
Seven days.

653
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:31,975
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna die next Monday?

654
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:33,305
Yes.
No. Wait.

655
00:38:33,377 --> 00:38:35,641
Monday. That would be
seven business days.

656
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:37,647
This is seven days starting now.

657
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:40,479
So seven days to this very hour?
My watch broke.

658
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:41,984
How am I gonna know
the exact hour?

659
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:44,647
Forget hours.
This day seven days from now.

660
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:47,418
But there's a holiday coming up.
Do you count the holiday?

661
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:49,322
Well, that depends.
What holiday?

662
00:38:49,393 --> 00:38:51,486
- Martin Luther King Day.
- Then no.

663
00:38:51,562 --> 00:38:53,826
Why not? Everybody at work
is taking it off.

664
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:56,162
Jesus Christ, lady. I'm giving
you seven friggin' days.

665
00:38:56,233 --> 00:38:58,724
I can come over now and kill the
shit out of you if you'd rather.

666
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,199
Yo, George, I don't care
what you say, man.

667
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:07,141
I'm signing you up
for another rap battle.

668
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:09,611
Mahalik, I told you.
That part of my life is over.

669
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,944
I said the same thing about
getting with C.J.'s sister.

670
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:14,610
- I'm still hitting that.
- He's still hitting it, man!

671
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:16,949
And she fine as shit!
That's my sister! What?

672
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,386
It doesn't matter.
I'm done.

673
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:20,947
- So what are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

674
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:25,722
Yeah! Yeah!
A-come on!

675
00:39:25,796 --> 00:39:28,822
Maybe my brother was right.
Maybe I should just settle down.

676
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,400
- What's up, then?!
- Mother...

677
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:33,630
I got another one, y'all.

678
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:37,140
Yo, George, man, you can't focus
on that shit, man.

679
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:39,403
Let that go.

680
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:42,503
Hey, you got to try
this shit, George.

681
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:44,948
Ow!

682
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:48,245
Yo, man, you got to take
the lid off!

683
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:50,753
- Oh, yes. Of course.
- Sorry!

684
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:53,147
Hello?

685
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:56,022
George, something
terrible has happened!

686
00:39:58,295 --> 00:39:59,922
Cindy, are you okay?
What's going on?

687
00:39:59,997 --> 00:40:01,965
George, you have to help me.

688
00:40:02,032 --> 00:40:04,500
I just watched the same tape
that killed Brenda.

689
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:08,004
Then the phone rang, and this
voice said I was gonna die.

690
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:10,666
Cindy, there's no such thing
as a killer videotape.

691
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:12,265
- Oh.
- Hell, yeah, there is!

692
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:14,106
I know somebody who can
help you.

693
00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:15,668
- You do? Who?
- Wait up, man.

694
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:18,715
I heard Jamal from 90th street
watched that tape last week.

695
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:20,182
This morning he woke up dead.

696
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,980
How in the hell
do you wake up dead?

697
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:23,952
'Cause you're alive
when you go to sleep.

698
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:26,888
You're telling me you can go
to bed dead and wake up alive?

699
00:40:26,957 --> 00:40:28,515
You can't go to bed dead!

700
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:30,856
- That shit would be redundant.
- No, it wouldn't.

701
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:33,055
'Cause you can go to bed
and not be dead.

702
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:34,825
And you can die
but not be in a bed.

703
00:40:34,899 --> 00:40:36,161
But you are in a bed, man.

704
00:40:36,233 --> 00:40:38,599
That's how you wake up dead
in the first place!

705
00:40:38,669 --> 00:40:41,570
Damn! That's some quantum shit
right there, man!

706
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:43,834
You should be teaching classes!

707
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:46,172
- Just tell me who can help me!
- Damn!

708
00:40:46,243 --> 00:40:47,141
My Aunt ShaNeequa.

709
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:49,042
Her and her man
into this weird shit.

710
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:51,741
They saw the tape before anybody
else knew about it.

711
00:40:51,816 --> 00:40:54,785
- Go see them tonight.
- Tonight? Yeah.

712
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:57,184
But who will take care of Cody?

713
00:40:58,656 --> 00:41:00,715
George,
we're gonna have so much fun.

714
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:02,656
I have some puzzles
and board games

715
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:04,318
and baseball cards in my room

716
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:05,987
and this really cool
model airplane.

717
00:41:06,063 --> 00:41:07,496
- I'm gonna go get it.
- Sure.

718
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:09,055
Okay, so I made him a snack.

719
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:11,829
You can give him some warm milk
if he can't go to sleep.

720
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:13,699
- Everything's gonna be fine.
- Here it is.

721
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:16,205
I'm great with kids.
Heads up, Cody.

722
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:18,104
Ugh!

723
00:41:18,175 --> 00:41:21,042
- Oh, I left some numbers.
- I'm okay.

724
00:41:21,111 --> 00:41:22,510
Ugh!

725
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,514
Sorry.
You okay, kiddo?

726
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:26,743
Thataboy.

727
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:31,815
And I guess that's it.

728
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:34,551
- Okay, I'm off.
- Right.

729
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:36,024
You know, it's funny.

730
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:40,029
All a child ever really wants
is a family.

731
00:41:40,097 --> 00:41:41,359
Yo.

732
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:43,531
Cody really likes you.

733
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:44,932
Oh, he's a good kid.

734
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:46,435
Yeah.

735
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:48,938
Oh!

736
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:50,906
- Bye.
- Bye.

737
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:08,319
Hello?

738
00:42:08,392 --> 00:42:09,620
I know.

739
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:12,560
You're Cindy.
Be right with you.

740
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:14,291
Aunt ShaNeequa?

741
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,856
Bingo.

742
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:18,765
But you can call me
the Oracle.

743
00:42:18,836 --> 00:42:20,394
And don't worry about that vase.

744
00:42:20,471 --> 00:42:22,996
What vase? Oh!
Sorry. I didn't know.

745
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:25,337
Oh! Aah!

746
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:27,673
That vase.

747
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:30,613
Please, sit.

748
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:38,253
It was the chair.

749
00:42:38,322 --> 00:42:39,516
Mmm.

750
00:42:44,461 --> 00:42:46,395
Yes, the chair.

751
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:48,960
I know why you've come.

752
00:42:49,033 --> 00:42:51,797
A great mystery
lies ahead of you,

753
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:54,531
but you must not shy away
from the challenge.

754
00:42:54,605 --> 00:42:56,937
Only you can be the one...

755
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:00,141
- Orpheus?
- What, baby?

756
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:02,041
Sweetie?

757
00:43:02,112 --> 00:43:04,046
I'm watching the game.

758
00:43:05,649 --> 00:43:06,980
Do you mind?

759
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,515
The Lakers will win by 12.

760
00:43:13,691 --> 00:43:16,387
- So can you tell me about...
- The tape?

761
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:19,987
- Yes. I watched it and...
- The phone rang.

762
00:43:20,064 --> 00:43:23,830
- Right. Then this voice said...
- That you would die.

763
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:26,392
- Okay, that's getting...
- Extremely annoying.

764
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:27,402
Yeah.

765
00:43:27,471 --> 00:43:29,166
Try being married to her.

766
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:32,800
I catch shit about women
I ain't slept with yet.

767
00:43:34,078 --> 00:43:35,909
You made a copy of the tape.
Let's see it.

768
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:37,880
Yes. Okay.

769
00:43:44,254 --> 00:43:45,721
ShaNeequa, can you tell me if...

770
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:48,519
The tape is connected to the
crop circles and the aliens?

771
00:43:48,592 --> 00:43:53,723
Yes. But it's up to you
to discover how for yourself.

772
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:54,991
Look, it's a...

773
00:43:55,065 --> 00:43:56,828
Cigarette?

774
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:59,664
I was going to say lighthouse.

775
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:03,463
Find that lighthouse.
It's your destiny.

776
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:06,443
Wait.

777
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:08,375
What is that?

778
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:14,750
Oh, my God.

779
00:44:33,604 --> 00:44:35,902
There we go.
Ugh!

780
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:39,204
Now, baby.

781
00:44:39,777 --> 00:44:41,938
I knew that was gonna happen.

782
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:44,037
Uh-oh.
Come on.

783
00:44:45,783 --> 00:44:46,807
Oh, hell, no.

784
00:44:46,884 --> 00:44:50,217
Get your ass out of the TV!
What's wrong with you?

785
00:44:50,287 --> 00:44:52,050
I'm gonna teach you!

786
00:44:52,122 --> 00:44:53,521
Get out of that TV!

787
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:55,922
Baby, no! No!
Let her go! Let her go!

788
00:44:55,993 --> 00:44:58,359
Let her go!
We gonna get another lawsuit.

789
00:44:58,429 --> 00:45:00,488
She spit on me.
I'm gonna kill the bitch.

790
00:45:00,564 --> 00:45:01,622
Ah!

791
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:02,927
You won.
You won.

792
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,627
You won.
You won.

793
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:06,135
- Upstairs.
- Okay.

794
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:07,397
- Down low.
- Okay.

795
00:45:07,471 --> 00:45:08,938
- All right.
- Baby, no!

796
00:45:09,006 --> 00:45:12,134
- Kill her! Is you crazy?
- Baby!

797
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:14,609
What you gonna brush now?

798
00:45:14,678 --> 00:45:16,145
What you gonna brush now, huh?

799
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:17,237
Come on, baby!

800
00:45:17,314 --> 00:45:20,215
You picked the wrong TV
to come out of.

801
00:45:25,022 --> 00:45:27,718
George?
Cody?

802
00:45:27,791 --> 00:45:29,349
Oh!

803
00:45:30,427 --> 00:45:32,122
George?

804
00:45:32,196 --> 00:45:34,391
- Ow!
- What happened?

805
00:45:34,465 --> 00:45:35,932
I don't know.

806
00:45:35,999 --> 00:45:38,160
Cody and I were playing
a fun game,

807
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:39,759
and then I looked down.

808
00:45:39,837 --> 00:45:42,067
Yahtzee!

809
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:50,407
No!

810
00:45:51,648 --> 00:45:53,240
Oh, my God!

811
00:45:53,617 --> 00:45:55,209
How could you let him
watch the tape?

812
00:46:04,528 --> 00:46:05,790
Hello?

813
00:46:05,863 --> 00:46:09,629
- It's me. How you doing?
- Fine.

814
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:12,635
Enjoying your last week?
I can't wait to see you.

815
00:46:12,703 --> 00:46:15,797
- Six days now, right?
- Yeah.

816
00:46:15,873 --> 00:46:18,273
It was great catching up.
Can I speak to Cody?

817
00:46:18,342 --> 00:46:20,640
Why?
He didn't watch the tape.

818
00:46:20,711 --> 00:46:23,646
Yes, he did. Come on, Cindy,
I do this for a living.

819
00:46:23,714 --> 00:46:25,614
Leave us alone!

820
00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:31,619
Hello?

821
00:46:31,688 --> 00:46:33,451
Hello, I'm calling
from "Reader's Digest"

822
00:46:33,524 --> 00:46:35,151
with a fantastic offer
for Cody.

823
00:46:35,225 --> 00:46:36,852
Aah!

824
00:46:36,927 --> 00:46:39,828
No, you're not! You're that evil
little girl from the tape!

825
00:46:39,897 --> 00:46:41,728
Okay, you got me.

826
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:43,630
How about I just leave
a message for him?

827
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:45,361
Fine.

828
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:48,167
Uh-huh.

829
00:46:48,238 --> 00:46:51,765
Yeah. Okay, how do you
spell that?

830
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:52,774
Right.

831
00:46:52,843 --> 00:46:56,074
Okay, got it.
Bye-bye.

832
00:46:58,749 --> 00:47:01,217
Aaaah!

833
00:47:01,852 --> 00:47:03,444
I can't believe
you let that happen.

834
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:04,953
I know. I'm sorry.
I screwed up.

835
00:47:05,022 --> 00:47:07,013
Listen, we can still save him.

836
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:09,115
The answer to the tape,
to your crop circles,

837
00:47:09,193 --> 00:47:10,888
is at a lighthouse.

838
00:47:10,961 --> 00:47:12,758
Oh, you think I'm crazy,
don't you?

839
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:13,762
Of course I do.

840
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:16,994
But the last thing you need now
is a screw-up like me.

841
00:47:17,067 --> 00:47:18,762
I'm gonna leave for good.

842
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:20,098
Wait.

843
00:47:21,872 --> 00:47:25,535
Well, what should I tell Cody?

844
00:47:25,609 --> 00:47:26,633
Let him down easy.

845
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:28,769
Tell him I got called away
on business.

846
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:30,575
You'll think of something.

847
00:47:30,647 --> 00:47:33,207
Testicular cancer.
He won't ask questions.

848
00:47:33,283 --> 00:47:35,046
I knew you'd understand.

849
00:47:35,118 --> 00:47:36,312
George!

850
00:47:36,386 --> 00:47:38,081
Just...

851
00:47:38,155 --> 00:47:39,918
be careful.

852
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:42,550
Something weird is going on
at your farm. I know it.

853
00:47:42,626 --> 00:47:43,888
I don't know.

854
00:47:43,961 --> 00:47:46,225
Sometimes a sheep needs
pushed through the fence.

855
00:47:46,296 --> 00:47:48,560
- What?
- Goodbye, Cindy.

856
00:48:13,323 --> 00:48:16,417
- Sue?
- I can't sleep.

857
00:48:16,493 --> 00:48:19,621
Well, it's way past
your bedtime.

858
00:48:21,598 --> 00:48:25,694
Won't you rock me to sleep
in your big, strong arms?

859
00:48:27,337 --> 00:48:30,238
There's plenty of room
under the covers.

860
00:48:30,307 --> 00:48:32,332
It's a hot night.

861
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:34,843
You don't need to wear pajamas.

862
00:48:36,713 --> 00:48:37,805
Where is my daughter?

863
00:48:37,881 --> 00:48:40,372
Are you mad?
I am your daughter.

864
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:42,042
No, you're not!

865
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:43,051
Aaaah!

866
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:44,314
Aah!

867
00:48:44,388 --> 00:48:47,289
Come here!
What did you do with Sue?

868
00:48:47,357 --> 00:48:48,847
I didn't touch her.
I swear.

869
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:50,120
I don't believe you!

870
00:48:50,193 --> 00:48:52,661
Please! For God's sake,
she's a girl!

871
00:48:52,729 --> 00:48:54,594
You sick...

872
00:48:55,565 --> 00:48:56,725
Oh!

873
00:49:14,084 --> 00:49:16,416
- Aah!
- Daddy!

874
00:49:16,486 --> 00:49:18,681
How do you like it, huh?

875
00:49:18,755 --> 00:49:20,746
Having fun?

876
00:49:20,824 --> 00:49:21,984
Aaah!

877
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,600
Tom, are you...

878
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:41,977
What in the world?

879
00:49:42,045 --> 00:49:43,273
Shh!

880
00:49:45,048 --> 00:49:47,039
Look.

881
00:49:47,117 --> 00:49:49,051
What is that thing?

882
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:51,178
I don't know.

883
00:49:51,254 --> 00:49:54,121
Maybe Cindy was right.

884
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:11,864
Please, sir.
All I need is five minutes.

885
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:15,207
And I told you, Campbell,
no more paranoid on-air rants

886
00:50:15,278 --> 00:50:17,838
- about the supernatural.
- I know.

887
00:50:17,914 --> 00:50:20,348
This station is about sex,
violence, and the weather.

888
00:50:20,417 --> 00:50:22,009
Yes.
That reminds me.

889
00:50:22,085 --> 00:50:25,020
We're gonna need that "Porn Star
Shot Dead in a Hurricane" story.

890
00:50:25,088 --> 00:50:26,612
One hour.

891
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:29,158
Meanwhile,
a tornado in Charleston

892
00:50:29,226 --> 00:50:31,820
threatens a clothing-optional
beach where just yesterday

893
00:50:31,895 --> 00:50:34,295
a naked couple
was brutally murdered.

894
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:37,128
This just five miles
from where the last naked couple

895
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,599
was brutally murdered.

896
00:50:38,668 --> 00:50:40,499
Turning now to sports.

897
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:42,561
And an evil videotape

898
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:45,767
that kills anyone
who watches it in seven days.

899
00:50:45,842 --> 00:50:48,242
It's true.
We're all in danger.

900
00:50:48,311 --> 00:50:49,903
- There's an alien force
- Oh, no.

901
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:52,312
That's trying prevent you
from knowing the truth.

902
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:53,542
Campbell, are you insane?

903
00:50:53,617 --> 00:50:54,675
It's a horrible fate.

904
00:50:54,751 --> 00:50:55,911
Carson, I have to do this.

905
00:50:55,986 --> 00:50:58,045
Correction,
there really is no danger.

906
00:50:58,121 --> 00:51:00,817
Actually, I didn't really mean
anything I just said.

907
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:03,485
Yes, I did.
Every word of it.

908
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,994
Everyone watching this
could be dead in a week.

909
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:07,530
Oh, shizl gzngahr.

910
00:51:16,506 --> 00:51:20,465
469. I been cleaning after
this dumb-ass cracker Giggins

911
00:51:20,544 --> 00:51:21,533
for 10 years.

912
00:51:21,611 --> 00:51:24,273
But I been hitting it
with his woman for 12.

913
00:51:24,347 --> 00:51:25,814
Know what I'm saying, nigga?

914
00:51:25,882 --> 00:51:27,611
She likes her some chocolate.

915
00:51:27,684 --> 00:51:30,619
Sharpton for president, y'all.
I'm outie.

916
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:32,279
Peace.

917
00:51:32,355 --> 00:51:35,813
An evil videotape
that kills people in 7 days.

918
00:51:35,892 --> 00:51:37,689
Alien forces
threatening the world.

919
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:39,626
And who the hell
is this Cindy Campbell?

920
00:51:39,696 --> 00:51:42,563
If what she says is true, we're
facing an unprecedented crisis.

921
00:51:42,632 --> 00:51:43,656
Get me the president.

922
00:51:43,733 --> 00:51:44,859
You are the president.

923
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:47,301
Good. Then I already know
about this.

924
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:48,530
Let's order lunch.

925
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:51,199
Sir, I think you need
to go on TV

926
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:54,903
and convince the people that
there is no such thing as a UFO.

927
00:51:54,978 --> 00:51:56,912
Don't spell in front of me,
damn it.

928
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:58,311
Aliens, sir.

929
00:51:58,381 --> 00:52:00,508
There's no such thing
as aliens.

930
00:52:00,584 --> 00:52:02,484
- That's not quite true.
- Sir?

931
00:52:02,552 --> 00:52:05,578
A year ago, a UFO crash-landed
in New Mexico.

932
00:52:05,655 --> 00:52:08,647
- A body may have been recovered.
- "May have been"?

933
00:52:08,725 --> 00:52:11,489
Well, there was
a terrible mix-up.

934
00:52:11,561 --> 00:52:13,358
It was Thanksgiving.

935
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:15,830
The body was sent down
to the kitchen.

936
00:52:15,899 --> 00:52:19,733
They shoved stuffing up its ass,
and we ate it at a state dinner.

937
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:21,430
That's the last I saw of it.

938
00:52:21,505 --> 00:52:22,836
No, scratch that.

939
00:52:22,906 --> 00:52:24,965
There were some sandwiches
made the next day.

940
00:52:25,041 --> 00:52:26,167
Mr. President!

941
00:52:26,243 --> 00:52:27,835
- Listen to me.
- Agent Thompson!

942
00:52:27,911 --> 00:52:29,208
Back away from that window!

943
00:52:29,279 --> 00:52:32,009
What? Did I forget
to put my pants on again?

944
00:52:32,082 --> 00:52:34,016
No, sir. It's just a feeling
I've been having

945
00:52:34,084 --> 00:52:35,745
since the news about the aliens.

946
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:37,980
- Something's not right.
- I know what you mean.

947
00:52:38,054 --> 00:52:41,114
It's like that feeling
that something's not right.

948
00:52:42,259 --> 00:52:44,193
What is it?

949
00:52:44,261 --> 00:52:46,354
Some old Tupac, sir.

950
00:52:48,532 --> 00:52:53,128
"All eyez on me."
Hey, this shit is banging.

951
00:52:53,203 --> 00:52:55,763
Thank you, sir.
I appreciate it.

952
00:53:25,068 --> 00:53:27,059
Oh!

953
00:54:09,713 --> 00:54:11,874
Hello, Cindy.

954
00:54:14,117 --> 00:54:16,608
I am the Architect.

955
00:54:16,686 --> 00:54:18,017
You have many questions.

956
00:54:20,991 --> 00:54:23,892
I've been watching you
for a very long time.

957
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:26,793
So I see.

958
00:54:26,863 --> 00:54:29,730
What is the connection between
the crop circles and the tape?

959
00:54:29,799 --> 00:54:30,959
The answer is simple.

960
00:54:31,034 --> 00:54:33,400
You are the eventuality
of an anomaly.

961
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:36,030
You are inexorably seeking
a sedulant probability.

962
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:37,164
Sedulant?

963
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:38,901
Grotesquerie?
No?

964
00:54:38,975 --> 00:54:41,170
What about
contingent affirmation?

965
00:54:41,244 --> 00:54:43,075
- That's got to mean something.
- Hey!

966
00:54:43,146 --> 00:54:47,173
Hey!
You put cameras in my bathroom?

967
00:54:49,085 --> 00:54:50,677
What is this?

968
00:54:50,754 --> 00:54:54,315
Oh, my God.
Well, it was a long winter.

969
00:54:54,391 --> 00:54:55,688
This is an invasion of...
Ow!

970
00:54:55,759 --> 00:54:57,056
Oh, sorry.

971
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:59,527
I can't help it.
It's very Ionely in here.

972
00:54:59,596 --> 00:55:03,088
Ergo, I haven't been with anyone
in a very long time,

973
00:55:03,166 --> 00:55:04,758
not counting myself.

974
00:55:04,834 --> 00:55:07,268
Or this chair.

975
00:55:07,337 --> 00:55:09,635
I call her...

976
00:55:09,706 --> 00:55:10,900
Linda.

977
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:13,499
Could you just cut to the chase?
I'm kind of in a rush.

978
00:55:13,576 --> 00:55:15,806
Why? You can always sleep over
if you want.

979
00:55:15,879 --> 00:55:17,938
Linda's built for two,
and she vibrates.

980
00:55:18,014 --> 00:55:20,005
Stop it! Just tell me
what I need to know.

981
00:55:20,083 --> 00:55:21,448
Who is that little girl?

982
00:55:21,518 --> 00:55:23,418
Okay, okay.

983
00:55:25,188 --> 00:55:28,589
My wife and I wanted a child,
but she couldn't get pregnant.

984
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:30,592
Neither could I.

985
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:31,786
So you adopted.

986
00:55:31,861 --> 00:55:34,329
We loved our daughter,
but she was evil.

987
00:55:34,397 --> 00:55:36,797
Made the horses crazy,
killed our puppies,

988
00:55:36,866 --> 00:55:37,833
hid the remote.

989
00:55:37,901 --> 00:55:39,129
Really sick shit.

990
00:55:39,202 --> 00:55:41,067
My wife took her
to the old family farm

991
00:55:41,137 --> 00:55:43,002
and drowned her in the well.

992
00:55:43,073 --> 00:55:46,440
I felt a simple time-out
would have been sufficient.

993
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:50,070
But Tabitha imprinted her evil
on a videotape.

994
00:55:50,146 --> 00:55:52,239
I never meant for it
to get out, but...

995
00:55:52,315 --> 00:55:53,873
But what?

996
00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:56,510
I put it in the wrong box
and returned it to Blockbuster,

997
00:55:56,586 --> 00:55:58,451
instead of my copy
of "Pootie Tang."

998
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:01,456
It's been circulating
and killing ever since.

999
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:03,458
Just like "Pootie Tang."

1000
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:06,324
But what does this
have to do with aliens?

1001
00:56:06,396 --> 00:56:07,454
I don't know.

1002
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:10,294
Perhaps Tabitha's summoning them
to kill us all.

1003
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:12,835
An alien invasion?

1004
00:56:12,902 --> 00:56:14,301
I have to warn the world.

1005
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:17,238
It's already begun.
You're too late.

1006
00:56:17,307 --> 00:56:19,002
Oh, my God.

1007
00:56:19,075 --> 00:56:22,340
But not too late
to make an old man happy.

1008
00:56:23,246 --> 00:56:25,339
What?

1009
00:56:25,415 --> 00:56:28,179
And now reports of lights
in the sky.

1010
00:56:28,251 --> 00:56:30,481
Glimpses of spacecraft.

1011
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:34,649
Possible alien sightings being
reported all over the world.

1012
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:35,986
Are they aliens?

1013
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:38,493
The first video images
are coming in.

1014
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:40,358
Disturbing home video tonight

1015
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:42,864
from a ranch
outside Sydney, Australia.

1016
00:56:42,932 --> 00:56:45,264
Watch very carefully now.

1017
00:56:45,335 --> 00:56:46,427
There it is.

1018
00:56:46,503 --> 00:56:47,800
Let's see that again.

1019
00:56:49,339 --> 00:56:51,102
Very, very disturbing.

1020
00:56:51,174 --> 00:56:54,541
And this just in
from Sao Paulo, Brazil.

1021
00:56:57,046 --> 00:56:58,877
Let's see that again.

1022
00:57:03,787 --> 00:57:07,120
Very, very disturbing.

1023
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:09,852
And this just in
from South Texas.

1024
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:15,859
Do they pose a threat?

1025
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:17,524
Only one thing's for certain.

1026
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:20,569
We are all going to be killed.

1027
00:57:20,637 --> 00:57:22,434
We have to board up the house.

1028
00:57:22,572 --> 00:57:24,597
Are you sure
this is necessary, Wilson?

1029
00:57:24,674 --> 00:57:26,835
Having an awards ceremony
at a time like this?

1030
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:30,141
Yes, sir. Everything must
appear business as usual.

1031
00:57:30,213 --> 00:57:33,114
The nation, while not yet
panicked, is deeply disturbed.

1032
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:34,810
Right.
We can steer that course,

1033
00:57:34,884 --> 00:57:36,818
keeping everybody
deeply disturbed.

1034
00:57:36,886 --> 00:57:38,148
We don't want a panic.

1035
00:57:38,221 --> 00:57:40,655
Very few presidents have faced
a crisis like this.

1036
00:57:40,723 --> 00:57:43,624
I wonder what President Ford
would've done.

1037
00:57:43,693 --> 00:57:45,627
Well, if the buck stops here...

1038
00:57:45,695 --> 00:57:47,663
the buck stops here.

1039
00:57:49,899 --> 00:57:52,732
Thank you all,
and welcome to the White House.

1040
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:55,430
The Mother Teresa Awards

1041
00:57:55,505 --> 00:57:57,530
recognize those
who have overcome

1042
00:57:57,607 --> 00:57:59,939
the severest handicaps
and disadvantages

1043
00:58:00,009 --> 00:58:02,204
to help others
in their communities.

1044
00:58:02,278 --> 00:58:05,543
The young, the old.
Black and white.

1045
00:58:05,615 --> 00:58:08,106
Our Native American friends.
Hey, how are you?

1046
00:58:08,184 --> 00:58:10,948
Hey, how are you?
Hey, how are you?

1047
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:12,214
Hey, how are you?

1048
00:58:12,288 --> 00:58:15,621
Ah.
Well, it is therefore my honor

1049
00:58:15,692 --> 00:58:20,561
to present each and every one of
you with this symbol of merit.

1050
00:58:25,702 --> 00:58:27,795
The room is secure,
Mr. President.

1051
00:58:27,871 --> 00:58:29,964
- Or is it?
- Sir?

1052
00:58:30,039 --> 00:58:31,472
I've been thinking, Thompson.

1053
00:58:31,541 --> 00:58:33,975
What if the aliens could
take over human bodies?

1054
00:58:34,043 --> 00:58:35,476
They'd look just like us.

1055
00:58:35,545 --> 00:58:36,807
Or almost.

1056
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:38,313
I never thought of that, sir.

1057
00:58:38,381 --> 00:58:40,611
We should be on alert
for anything suspicious.

1058
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:42,082
They could be anywhere.

1059
00:58:42,151 --> 00:58:43,311
Even...

1060
00:58:43,386 --> 00:58:44,580
Right here.

1061
00:58:44,654 --> 00:58:45,746
My God.

1062
00:58:45,822 --> 00:58:47,653
We'd never see
the attack coming.

1063
00:58:47,724 --> 00:58:51,057
- It's frightening, sir!
- Don't panic.

1064
00:58:51,127 --> 00:58:54,722
We'll just move slowly
toward the exit.

1065
00:58:55,798 --> 00:58:58,494
At last we meet, Mr. President.

1066
00:58:58,568 --> 00:59:00,001
It's happening.
I knew it.

1067
00:59:00,069 --> 00:59:01,434
You'll never take me alive!

1068
00:59:01,504 --> 00:59:02,664
Aaaah!

1069
00:59:02,739 --> 00:59:04,969
Ah!
She's scrambling my brain!

1070
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:06,338
I'll get her!

1071
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:09,405
Aaah!

1072
00:59:09,479 --> 00:59:12,141
Oh, no, you don't!
Not on my watch!

1073
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:13,944
Good work, sir!

1074
00:59:15,652 --> 00:59:17,984
Good God!
The small ones have metal teeth!

1075
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:20,488
Jerry's kids, my ass!

1076
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:23,188
Mr. President!

1077
00:59:23,259 --> 00:59:26,160
Mr. President, have you gone
completely insane?

1078
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:27,753
Like a fox.

1079
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:29,957
We got to talk to the person
who saw this coming,

1080
00:59:30,033 --> 00:59:31,193
Cindy Campbell.

1081
00:59:31,267 --> 00:59:32,894
She knows how
to defeat the aliens.

1082
00:59:32,969 --> 00:59:35,096
- Filthy, rotten scum!
- Aah!

1083
00:59:35,171 --> 00:59:36,832
Aah!
You're hideous!

1084
00:59:36,906 --> 00:59:38,134
Get off my planet!

1085
00:59:38,207 --> 00:59:40,971
- No!
- Is everything all right?

1086
00:59:41,044 --> 00:59:42,375
The exits are all blocked.

1087
00:59:42,445 --> 00:59:43,935
I'll find one, sir.

1088
00:59:44,013 --> 00:59:46,106
Everybody, clear!

1089
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:51,149
This way, sir!
God, this is exciting!

1090
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:54,121
You're excited?
You should feel my nipples.

1091
00:59:54,190 --> 00:59:55,987
Cody?

1092
00:59:56,059 --> 00:59:59,119
Cody?
Cody, where are you?

1093
00:59:59,195 --> 01:00:00,389
Honey?

1094
01:00:00,463 --> 01:00:02,795
After today's incident
in the East Room,

1095
01:00:02,865 --> 01:00:05,356
the White House
is now advising all citizens

1096
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:09,166
to board up their homes and
prepare for an alien invasion.

1097
01:00:09,238 --> 01:00:11,172
Oh, no.

1098
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:13,674
And now a News 8 exclusive.

1099
01:00:13,743 --> 01:00:16,075
The killer videotape
you've been hearing about.

1100
01:00:16,145 --> 01:00:17,703
We're the only station
that has it,

1101
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,441
and we're showing it all night.

1102
01:00:19,515 --> 01:00:21,506
Very exciting.
Let's roll it again.

1103
01:00:25,822 --> 01:00:28,188
There. Nobody's getting
through that sucker.

1104
01:00:28,257 --> 01:00:30,555
But we have to get down
to the cellar.

1105
01:00:32,095 --> 01:00:34,086
- George.
- Cindy.

1106
01:00:34,163 --> 01:00:35,596
There's no time.

1107
01:00:35,665 --> 01:00:36,996
Cody.

1108
01:00:37,066 --> 01:00:39,034
Thank God.
I've been worried sick.

1109
01:00:39,102 --> 01:00:41,662
He showed up about an hour ago.
I tried to call.

1110
01:00:41,738 --> 01:00:43,399
No, he didn't.

1111
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:45,498
Okay, but I was gonna.

1112
01:00:45,575 --> 01:00:47,338
No, he wasn't.

1113
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:50,868
Cody, the point is you can't
just run away like that.

1114
01:00:50,947 --> 01:00:52,881
I wanted to be with George.

1115
01:00:52,949 --> 01:00:55,645
Oh, honey, I know
you want a dad, but...

1116
01:00:55,718 --> 01:00:58,744
Oh, trust me, Cody,
I'm not good at anything.

1117
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:00,220
Why would I be good at that?

1118
01:01:00,289 --> 01:01:02,587
Uncle George!

1119
01:01:14,904 --> 01:01:17,464
It's gonna be okay, Cody.

1120
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:19,940
I'm going to die, aren't I?

1121
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:22,773
Cody, did I ever tell you
what your mom said

1122
01:01:22,845 --> 01:01:24,938
about you
the day you were born?

1123
01:01:25,014 --> 01:01:26,038
No.

1124
01:01:26,115 --> 01:01:28,515
I was in the delivery room
with her.

1125
01:01:28,584 --> 01:01:30,415
She was having a hard time.

1126
01:01:30,486 --> 01:01:32,113
Then you began
to come out of her.

1127
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:35,350
And your mom screamed
and screamed in pain.

1128
01:01:35,425 --> 01:01:37,188
She yelled, "Just kill me.

1129
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:38,852
Bludgeon me with a bedpan.

1130
01:01:38,928 --> 01:01:41,624
Whatever you do,
put me out of this pain."

1131
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:43,859
She was gushing
torrents of blood.

1132
01:01:43,933 --> 01:01:46,663
I have this all on tape
if you want to see it someday.

1133
01:01:46,736 --> 01:01:48,636
Well, finally you came out.

1134
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:51,503
Your mom cut
your umbilical cord herself.

1135
01:01:51,574 --> 01:01:54,509
Well, on the second try.

1136
01:01:54,577 --> 01:01:57,341
The first time she snipped
your penis in half.

1137
01:01:57,413 --> 01:01:58,903
After all, she was drunk.

1138
01:01:58,981 --> 01:02:00,471
Actually, drugged.

1139
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:03,519
We'd been out the night before
celebrating St. Patrick's Day.

1140
01:02:03,586 --> 01:02:05,816
She thought, "Hey,
I never tasted crystal meth."

1141
01:02:05,888 --> 01:02:07,822
So she did just a little.

1142
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:09,084
My penis?

1143
01:02:09,158 --> 01:02:10,022
Yes.

1144
01:02:10,093 --> 01:02:12,584
They sewed it on upside down.

1145
01:02:12,662 --> 01:02:14,459
So that's why I pee up?

1146
01:02:14,530 --> 01:02:15,997
Yes.
We'll get it fixed, honey.

1147
01:02:16,065 --> 01:02:18,966
It's on my list of things.
Right after we get TiVo.

1148
01:02:19,035 --> 01:02:20,832
Anyway, there you were.

1149
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:22,495
Your mom turned to me and said,

1150
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:25,507
"Hey, you want him?
Take him."

1151
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:27,338
Then she died.

1152
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:28,843
And I took you.

1153
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:31,106
Do you know why?

1154
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:32,841
I had just lost my cat
in a fire,

1155
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:34,780
and I needed something
to pet and feed.

1156
01:02:34,851 --> 01:02:37,684
And I miss that cat, Cody.

1157
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:39,244
But I love you.

1158
01:02:39,322 --> 01:02:41,483
And nothing's
ever gonna change that,

1159
01:02:41,557 --> 01:02:44,185
not even the very painful death
we're about to experience.

1160
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:45,727
George!

1161
01:02:54,003 --> 01:02:55,027
Are they gone?

1162
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:56,298
I don't hear anything.

1163
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:05,642
Don't worry, Sue.

1164
01:03:05,715 --> 01:03:06,977
It was Uncle George.

1165
01:03:07,049 --> 01:03:09,643
Well, it's scary.

1166
01:03:11,053 --> 01:03:13,317
Good work, Sue.

1167
01:03:13,389 --> 01:03:15,653
I don't know what stupid,
idiotic thing

1168
01:03:15,725 --> 01:03:17,716
made these lights go off.

1169
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:20,319
All right, there's spare fuses
in the crawl space.

1170
01:03:20,396 --> 01:03:21,920
I can get these lights back on.

1171
01:03:23,332 --> 01:03:25,823
Quick, George,
grab that railroad tie.

1172
01:03:25,902 --> 01:03:27,597
Jam it against the door.

1173
01:03:28,004 --> 01:03:29,232
Oh!

1174
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:31,500
My balls!

1175
01:03:31,574 --> 01:03:33,667
Oh!
Not those!

1176
01:03:33,743 --> 01:03:35,335
Jesus!

1177
01:03:35,411 --> 01:03:36,708
No!

1178
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:38,781
Uncle George!

1179
01:03:38,848 --> 01:03:40,179
I'm scared!

1180
01:03:40,249 --> 01:03:43,047
Oh, sweetie, come here.
It's okay.

1181
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:44,746
Aah!

1182
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:47,915
There's something
on the other side of the door.

1183
01:04:01,304 --> 01:04:03,329
I can't see anything.

1184
01:04:19,021 --> 01:04:20,249
Oh, my God.

1185
01:04:20,323 --> 01:04:21,756
Can you see them?

1186
01:04:21,824 --> 01:04:23,553
They're horrible.

1187
01:04:23,626 --> 01:04:25,719
They're grayish
with big black eyes.

1188
01:04:25,795 --> 01:04:27,558
Their teeth are grotesque.

1189
01:04:29,332 --> 01:04:32,631
- I think they're giggling.
- What?

1190
01:04:33,502 --> 01:04:34,434
Oh, no.

1191
01:04:34,503 --> 01:04:36,994
Oh, no, I think...

1192
01:04:37,073 --> 01:04:39,667
I think they want...

1193
01:04:41,244 --> 01:04:42,836
Aaah!
Help!

1194
01:04:42,912 --> 01:04:44,573
Cody!
Oh, my God!

1195
01:04:44,647 --> 01:04:46,945
George.
Swing away, George.

1196
01:04:47,016 --> 01:04:48,916
- Aah! Aunt Cindy, help!
- I'm coming, Cody.

1197
01:04:48,985 --> 01:04:50,179
I'll save you.

1198
01:04:50,253 --> 01:04:51,982
- Ugh!
- Die!

1199
01:04:55,157 --> 01:04:56,089
Die!

1200
01:04:56,158 --> 01:04:58,285
You damn aliens, let him go!

1201
01:04:58,361 --> 01:04:59,953
You're not getting in here!

1202
01:05:00,029 --> 01:05:01,929
- What else you got?
- George.

1203
01:05:01,998 --> 01:05:04,091
There!
Had enough?

1204
01:05:04,166 --> 01:05:06,794
Yeah. Forget it, Cody.
Thank me later.

1205
01:05:06,869 --> 01:05:08,632
Oh, Cody.
Oh, thank God.

1206
01:05:08,704 --> 01:05:09,636
Come on.

1207
01:05:09,705 --> 01:05:10,797
Daddy!

1208
01:05:10,873 --> 01:05:12,101
- Daddy!
- Sue!

1209
01:05:15,211 --> 01:05:16,473
Oh!

1210
01:05:16,545 --> 01:05:18,638
Mahalik,
what are you doing here?

1211
01:05:18,714 --> 01:05:20,875
I told you the hood's
always got your back.

1212
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:23,942
Thank God.
There's two of them at the door.

1213
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:24,987
They're gone.

1214
01:05:26,289 --> 01:05:28,382
Good.
They couldn't get in.

1215
01:05:28,457 --> 01:05:29,890
I hear they can't open doors.

1216
01:05:29,959 --> 01:05:31,654
They mastered space flight,

1217
01:05:31,727 --> 01:05:33,627
but they can't get
through a wooden door?

1218
01:05:33,696 --> 01:05:35,823
Oh, look, the cellar's
the safest place.

1219
01:05:35,898 --> 01:05:37,729
Women and children stay here.

1220
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:39,859
- Ugh!
- All right, and the men,

1221
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:41,301
we go outside and fight.

1222
01:05:41,370 --> 01:05:44,032
Right. And what's
the cutoff age for children?

1223
01:05:44,106 --> 01:05:45,505
Come on!

1224
01:05:59,889 --> 01:06:02,221
Follow me.

1225
01:06:15,404 --> 01:06:16,428
I'm sorry.

1226
01:06:16,505 --> 01:06:18,905
I thought
I was hitting the brake.

1227
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:21,910
Now, we don't have to go
through insurance, do we?

1228
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:24,071
Mr. President,
what are you doing here?

1229
01:06:24,146 --> 01:06:25,511
I'm looking for Cindy Campbell.

1230
01:06:25,581 --> 01:06:28,049
She may hold the key
to defeating the aliens.

1231
01:06:28,117 --> 01:06:32,247
Ah, good. The Air Force is here
with those new round planes.

1232
01:06:33,489 --> 01:06:36,253
We don't have round planes, sir.

1233
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:37,917
Oh, my God.

1234
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:39,461
Oh, my God.

1235
01:06:39,528 --> 01:06:42,691
Wait. Do you hear that?

1236
01:06:52,375 --> 01:06:54,468
- Yo, what's up, George?
- C.J.!

1237
01:06:54,543 --> 01:06:56,511
I told you the 'hood
always got your back.

1238
01:06:56,579 --> 01:06:59,810
I got the boys with me.
Get out the car, man.

1239
01:06:59,882 --> 01:07:00,940
Who we gonna shoot?

1240
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:02,314
Is y'all ready to go step?

1241
01:07:02,385 --> 01:07:04,751
Let's go do this,
'cause I'm hyped right now!

1242
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:07,084
- Real hyped!
- You stepped on my shoe, bitch!

1243
01:07:07,156 --> 01:07:08,282
Call me "bitch" again,

1244
01:07:08,357 --> 01:07:11,258
and I'll park your truck
dead in your ass.

1245
01:07:11,327 --> 01:07:12,123
Damn, homey!

1246
01:07:12,194 --> 01:07:14,526
- In the cornfield.
- They're coming!

1247
01:07:14,597 --> 01:07:16,724
Me and my boys,
we gonna take care of this.

1248
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:18,266
Come on, let's go.

1249
01:07:18,334 --> 01:07:20,302
Son, I'd bust
this shit right now.

1250
01:07:20,369 --> 01:07:22,132
- Your mama!
- I got your number, homey.

1251
01:07:22,204 --> 01:07:24,399
- We over here, y'all!
- He ain't gonna bust nothing.

1252
01:07:24,473 --> 01:07:25,735
I got nuts bigger than him.

1253
01:07:25,808 --> 01:07:28,675
Whoa, country-ass,
maple-syrup nigga.

1254
01:07:28,744 --> 01:07:32,180
Yeah, you want some biscuits?
You want some biscuits?

1255
01:07:33,582 --> 01:07:35,641
Get down!
Get down!

1256
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:45,520
I can't believe what I just saw.

1257
01:07:45,594 --> 01:07:47,323
These men died
for their country.

1258
01:07:47,396 --> 01:07:50,661
Send flowers
to their bitches and hos.

1259
01:07:55,104 --> 01:07:57,163
I can't break free!

1260
01:07:57,239 --> 01:08:01,039
Think! They must have
some kind of weakness.

1261
01:08:04,713 --> 01:08:05,475
- Huh?
- Huh?

1262
01:08:05,548 --> 01:08:06,742
I found it!

1263
01:08:06,816 --> 01:08:08,784
Without their heads,
they're powerless!

1264
01:08:08,851 --> 01:08:10,785
Please, no.
We mean you no harm.

1265
01:08:10,853 --> 01:08:13,617
We traveled to your planet
to find an evil little girl.

1266
01:08:13,689 --> 01:08:17,216
We must destroy her
before seven days.

1267
01:08:17,293 --> 01:08:19,659
You mean you watched
the videotape?

1268
01:08:19,728 --> 01:08:22,219
Our satellite picked up what
we thought was "Pootie Tang."

1269
01:08:22,298 --> 01:08:23,788
That was a week ago.

1270
01:08:23,866 --> 01:08:28,963
And now our entire race will die
unless the girl is destroyed.

1271
01:08:29,038 --> 01:08:32,007
Oh, see?
They are peaceful.

1272
01:08:32,074 --> 01:08:35,305
If they're so peaceful,
why were they choking us?

1273
01:08:35,377 --> 01:08:38,005
Oh, that's how we say hello.

1274
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:39,479
- Hello!
- Nice to see you.

1275
01:08:39,548 --> 01:08:41,539
- Hello.
- Hello.

1276
01:08:41,617 --> 01:08:43,585
Well, how do you guys
say goodbye?

1277
01:08:43,652 --> 01:08:44,880
Oh!

1278
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:47,514
I had to ask.

1279
01:08:47,590 --> 01:08:52,550
If you think that's strange,
you should see how we pee.

1280
01:08:58,434 --> 01:09:01,801
So we're not so different
after all.

1281
01:09:04,507 --> 01:09:06,441
There's something
about this place.

1282
01:09:06,509 --> 01:09:09,137
It's like I've seen it before.

1283
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:12,980
Oh, my God.

1284
01:09:16,452 --> 01:09:18,477
This used to be their farm.

1285
01:09:18,554 --> 01:09:20,351
She died right here.

1286
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:37,203
There's something down there.

1287
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:49,575
Ugh!

1288
01:10:01,397 --> 01:10:04,889
Hey, awesome.
Yeah, you got it.

1289
01:10:04,967 --> 01:10:06,161
Just look at this.

1290
01:10:06,235 --> 01:10:09,534
Human beings and aliens
working together.

1291
01:10:09,605 --> 01:10:13,063
We're all just
one big galactic family.

1292
01:10:13,142 --> 01:10:14,905
Family.

1293
01:10:14,977 --> 01:10:17,172
That's just what
I've been running away from.

1294
01:10:17,246 --> 01:10:20,340
Well, that's because
you're an idiot.

1295
01:10:30,292 --> 01:10:32,226
This is it.

1296
01:10:32,294 --> 01:10:34,455
My wife took her
to the family farm

1297
01:10:34,530 --> 01:10:36,657
and drowned her in the well.

1298
01:10:40,035 --> 01:10:44,938
The little girl.
She's frightened of the well.

1299
01:11:02,858 --> 01:11:04,018
Aah!

1300
01:11:04,093 --> 01:11:06,618
- Ugh!
- Cindy!

1301
01:11:43,932 --> 01:11:46,025
Time to go back
down the well, bitch.

1302
01:11:48,737 --> 01:11:49,669
Cindy!

1303
01:11:49,738 --> 01:11:52,502
No.
Don't hurt him!

1304
01:11:53,475 --> 01:11:54,965
Cindy, come outside.

1305
01:11:55,044 --> 01:11:56,602
- The aliens aren't invading.
- Aah!

1306
01:11:56,679 --> 01:11:58,237
Aah!

1307
01:11:58,314 --> 01:12:00,043
Don't worry, Cody.
I'll save you.

1308
01:12:00,115 --> 01:12:01,707
- Aah!
- Wait!

1309
01:12:01,784 --> 01:12:04,014
Wait.
Don't do this.

1310
01:12:04,086 --> 01:12:06,384
You don't have to be evil.

1311
01:12:07,356 --> 01:12:10,951
I know what happened
to you, Tabitha.

1312
01:12:12,194 --> 01:12:15,095
I know what your mom did.
That was wrong.

1313
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:16,859
You were just a little girl.

1314
01:12:16,932 --> 01:12:20,891
You're still that little girl,
just a lot more corpsy

1315
01:12:20,969 --> 01:12:23,403
and with really bad teeth.

1316
01:12:23,472 --> 01:12:27,568
But maybe all you need
is a mother.

1317
01:12:31,213 --> 01:12:33,113
And a father.

1318
01:12:45,761 --> 01:12:47,092
We could be...

1319
01:12:47,162 --> 01:12:49,187
A family.

1320
01:12:53,802 --> 01:12:55,531
Thank you all.

1321
01:12:55,604 --> 01:12:59,040
Your love has broken the curse
and freed my soul.

1322
01:12:59,108 --> 01:13:00,837
I'll never have to kill again.

1323
01:13:00,909 --> 01:13:02,570
Really?

1324
01:13:02,644 --> 01:13:06,239
Nah!
I'm just screwing with you!

1325
01:13:06,315 --> 01:13:08,579
Aah!

1326
01:13:08,650 --> 01:13:10,641
I just want to tell you both
good luck.

1327
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:12,448
We're all counting on you.

1328
01:13:21,597 --> 01:13:22,928
Now it's over.

1329
01:13:22,998 --> 01:13:24,192
Aah!

1330
01:13:24,266 --> 01:13:25,858
Oh, no, no, it's okay.

1331
01:13:25,934 --> 01:13:27,492
He's our friend.

1332
01:13:27,569 --> 01:13:29,537
Thank you for saving
our species.

1333
01:13:29,605 --> 01:13:31,539
Now we must return
to our home planet.

1334
01:13:31,607 --> 01:13:32,835
Goodbye, then.

1335
01:13:32,908 --> 01:13:33,840
Ugh!

1336
01:13:33,909 --> 01:13:35,467
Goodbye.

1337
01:13:54,229 --> 01:13:56,697
Hey, congratulations, George!

1338
01:13:56,765 --> 01:13:58,699
You know the 'hood
always got your back.

1339
01:13:58,767 --> 01:14:00,200
Yeah, yeah!

1340
01:14:00,269 --> 01:14:01,702
Come on!

1341
01:14:06,208 --> 01:14:07,300
Bye!

1342
01:14:07,376 --> 01:14:08,843
Whoo!

1343
01:14:08,911 --> 01:14:10,845
- Oh!
- Oh!

1344
01:14:21,390 --> 01:14:23,085
Bye!

1345
01:14:23,158 --> 01:14:26,787
Oh, George, I'm so happy.

1346
01:14:26,862 --> 01:14:28,329
Finally we're a family.

1347
01:14:28,397 --> 01:14:31,662
Yeah.
You, me, and...

1348
01:14:31,733 --> 01:14:32,597
- Damn!
- Damn!

1349
01:14:34,136 --> 01:14:36,969
Cindy, George, wait!

1350
01:23:27,736 --> 01:23:29,499
<i>- Check it out.
- Go! Go! Go!</i>

1351
01:23:37,736 --> 01:24:07,736
