1
00:00:33,744 --> 00:00:36,406
-Sure you don't wanna go tomyroom?
- No. Why?

2
00:00:36,514 --> 00:00:39,176
My room mate'sal ready moved out.
We'll be all alone.

3
00:00:39,283 --> 00:00:40,841
-All right.
- The dooris locked.

4
00:00:40,951 --> 00:00:42,782
- Okay,Jim, relax. Relax.
- Okay, yeah, sure.

5
00:00:42,887 --> 00:00:46,015
Nostrings attached, okay?
It's just friendly good-bye sex.

6
00:00:46,123 --> 00:00:48,259
Yeah, right.
Right, right, right, right.

7
00:00:48,259 --> 00:00:48,588
Yeah, right.
Right, right, right, right.

8
00:00:49,694 --> 00:00:52,219
But you see,
it'sjust that...

9
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:55,230
we've never even had
friendly hello sex.

10
00:00:55,332 --> 00:00:57,232
So do you not wanna do this?

11
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,597
Oh, I do. Yeah.
No, I definitely do.

12
00:01:03,407 --> 00:01:05,272
It's just that...

13
00:01:05,376 --> 00:01:07,674
you see, this is actually
my first time.

14
00:01:07,778 --> 00:01:10,838
Well, not my first.
It's my first time...

15
00:01:10,948 --> 00:01:13,473
since my first time.

16
00:01:14,585 --> 00:01:16,746
So, technically,
that's my second time.

17
00:01:16,854 --> 00:01:19,982
And I don't--
I don't wanna suck at it.

18
00:01:20,091 --> 00:01:22,491
So if I'm not up to par,
performance-wise--

19
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,254
Jim, this isn't exactly a turn-on.

20
00:01:26,363 --> 00:01:29,025
I mean, girls like a guy
with confidence.

21
00:01:30,501 --> 00:01:31,763
Hey, I'm confident.

22
00:01:31,869 --> 00:01:35,999
Oh, I am-- I'm absolutely,
totally confident.

23
00:01:37,508 --> 00:01:39,237
- Let's get naked.
- Okay.

24
00:01:42,279 --> 00:01:45,874
Seems like just yesterday my dad picked
me up after my first year at college.

25
00:01:47,084 --> 00:01:49,075
We popped a couple ofbeers...

26
00:01:49,186 --> 00:01:51,518
and he said,
"Now, you're a man."

27
00:01:51,622 --> 00:01:53,954
And today I get to say
the same thing to my son.

28
00:01:54,058 --> 00:01:56,117
Honey, your speeches
embarrass him.

29
00:01:56,227 --> 00:01:59,355
So, try and do what the kids say,
andjust be cool.

30
00:01:59,463 --> 00:02:03,058
I think I bring new meaning
to the word "cool," honey.

31
00:02:03,167 --> 00:02:04,828
That's his dormitory up ahead.

32
00:02:20,684 --> 00:02:22,242
Turn over.

33
00:02:29,894 --> 00:02:32,192
- Can't bring alcohol in the dorms.
- Good.

34
00:02:32,296 --> 00:02:36,392
Thankyou, Matt. I'm just here
to surprise my sonJim.

35
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,627
- Now pin my leg up.
- What?

36
00:02:38,736 --> 00:02:41,204
Pin my leg up, like this.

37
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:47,008
Maybe you can help
me out, you know.

38
00:02:50,514 --> 00:02:52,573
Is that the one? No.

39
00:02:52,683 --> 00:02:53,581
There!

40
00:02:57,755 --> 00:02:59,017
Now I remember.

41
00:03:01,292 --> 00:03:03,590
I didn't do this for you.

42
00:03:03,694 --> 00:03:05,252
Thanks, dude.

43
00:03:06,831 --> 00:03:09,425
- Where's my big guy?
- Oh, my God!

44
00:03:14,238 --> 00:03:16,832
-Jesus!
-Jim, we got here a little early.

45
00:03:16,941 --> 00:03:19,068
- Dad, get out!
- I'll wait in the car.

46
00:03:19,176 --> 00:03:20,643
Go, Dad!
Oh, my--

47
00:03:22,346 --> 00:03:23,973
- Geez!
- Was that your dad?

48
00:03:24,081 --> 00:03:26,276
- I'm so sorry.
- For your own edification...

49
00:03:26,383 --> 00:03:27,748
son, I'm not embarrassed.

50
00:03:27,852 --> 00:03:28,876
I am!

51
00:03:28,986 --> 00:03:31,318
It's a perfectly
normal thing for two...

52
00:03:31,422 --> 00:03:33,014
- human beings to do.
- Dad, what are you doing?

53
00:03:33,123 --> 00:03:35,182
This is human nature--
human nature at its best.

54
00:03:35,292 --> 00:03:39,456
Son, everybody does it. Your mother
and I-- Well, not so much anymore.

55
00:03:39,563 --> 00:03:41,929
Gotyour favorite.
Oh, my God! They're fucking!

56
00:03:42,032 --> 00:03:45,229
Honey, honey, listen.
I'm gonna take her--

57
00:03:45,336 --> 00:03:48,032
- Pleasejust go!
- Actually, ifyou wouldn't mind.

58
00:03:48,138 --> 00:03:50,504
Honey--
I'll take her to the car.

59
00:03:52,643 --> 00:03:54,304
- Hi, Mama.
- What?

60
00:03:54,411 --> 00:03:55,639
Natalie!

61
00:03:55,746 --> 00:03:57,145
I'm Jim's dad.

62
00:03:57,248 --> 00:03:59,239
You must be the parents
ofthis young lady.

63
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:02,146
I'm sorry I didn't get her name,
but hopefully my son did...

64
00:04:02,253 --> 00:04:02,753
because I have not been
here the whole time.

65
00:04:02,753 --> 00:04:04,152
because I have not been
here the whole time.

66
00:04:04,255 --> 00:04:06,450
Natalie, get dressed!

67
00:04:06,557 --> 00:04:09,219
- Beer?
- Avert your eyes! Turn around!

68
00:04:09,326 --> 00:04:11,351
- Thanks,Jim. Don't believe in locks?
- Oh, my God!

69
00:04:31,849 --> 00:04:33,111
Hey, fuckface.

70
00:04:33,217 --> 00:04:37,051
- Mornin', dude.
- Come on, Ozzy. It's show time.

71
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:42,458
Before you go to Ann Arbor
to pick up Heather...

72
00:04:42,559 --> 00:04:44,459
I wanna show you
what you're missing.

73
00:04:46,263 --> 00:04:48,959
See what they are today, dude.
See what they are today.

74
00:04:49,066 --> 00:04:51,261
Okay, here we go.
Moment of truth.

75
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:58,101
- There's little hearts on her panties!
- Super.

76
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:01,006
There's little hearts on her panties!
Come on, look, you pussy. Look.

77
00:05:01,111 --> 00:05:03,511
What the fuck, man?
Come on!

78
00:05:03,614 --> 00:05:05,104
I'm disappointed in you.

79
00:05:05,215 --> 00:05:08,116
Here it is, the end ofour freshman year
and you screwed one girl.

80
00:05:08,218 --> 00:05:10,277
One.

81
00:05:10,387 --> 00:05:12,287
You're a disgrace
to men every where.

82
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:15,358
Look at the Stifmeister.
I got laid 23 times this year...

83
00:05:15,459 --> 00:05:18,826
and I'm not counting the hummer
I got in the library stacks, baby.

84
00:05:18,929 --> 00:05:21,625
All right, here's a new idea
for you, Stifler, okay?

85
00:05:21,732 --> 00:05:23,859
You find a girl.
You two become best friends.

86
00:05:23,968 --> 00:05:26,835
You don't bother counting how many times
you have sex with each other.

87
00:05:26,937 --> 00:05:30,532
- You laugh at the people who do count.
- Here's a new idea for you.

88
00:05:30,641 --> 00:05:33,041
I'll getyou a spoon
soyou can eat my ass.

89
00:05:33,143 --> 00:05:37,011
Okay, people, notebooks closed.
Let's get this exam rolling.

90
00:05:38,349 --> 00:05:41,284
Oh, shit!
Do we got an exam today?

91
00:05:41,385 --> 00:05:43,945
- Areyou kiddin' me?
- Bullshit.

92
00:05:48,392 --> 00:05:52,294
Yes! I'm never even gonna think
about political science again.

93
00:05:52,396 --> 00:05:54,387
Hey. How'd you do?

94
00:05:54,498 --> 00:05:56,591
- Fine.
- Yeah?

95
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:00,397
I can't believe I'm doing the summer
abroad. Last thing I need, more classes.

96
00:06:00,504 --> 00:06:03,405
- You're gonna have a great time.
- Hello, summer!

97
00:06:04,675 --> 00:06:07,405
- Did that exam blow orwhat?
- Yeah, it sucked.

98
00:06:08,512 --> 00:06:10,377
- Kev, what's up, man? How are you?
- Good.

99
00:06:10,481 --> 00:06:12,608
Put your party hat on.

100
00:06:12,716 --> 00:06:15,150
- We got 1 2 weeks of immortality ahead.
- Yes, sir!

101
00:06:24,061 --> 00:06:25,551
Weird.

102
00:06:42,146 --> 00:06:44,944
The one that got away, huh, son?

103
00:06:52,156 --> 00:06:56,786
Well, evidently you two made quite
the hand some couple on the Internet.

104
00:06:59,797 --> 00:07:01,287
I didn't see it.

105
00:07:01,398 --> 00:07:04,856
It was brought up
at a PTA meeting.

106
00:07:04,968 --> 00:07:07,835
Anyway, my point is...

107
00:07:07,938 --> 00:07:12,375
these little sexual debacles should not
getyou down, becauseyou know what?

108
00:07:12,476 --> 00:07:14,376
It happens to the best ofus.

109
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:16,673
In fact...

110
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:19,749
the first time
your mother and I...

111
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:21,477
got together...

112
00:07:21,585 --> 00:07:22,813
I used a condom.

113
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:26,822
Well, she referred to it
as "shrinkwrapping."

114
00:07:29,359 --> 00:07:31,122
But I got over it.

115
00:07:31,228 --> 00:07:33,423
Anyway, keep your chin up.
You keep plugging...

116
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:36,021
and good things will happen.

117
00:07:36,133 --> 00:07:38,624
Good to have you home, son.

118
00:07:42,573 --> 00:07:45,133
It's good to be home, Dad.

119
00:07:45,309 --> 00:07:48,039
It's gonna be nice to hit Stifler's
tonight after exams.

120
00:07:48,145 --> 00:07:51,376
- Did you get through 'em?
- There's the mystery man!

121
00:07:51,482 --> 00:07:52,608
Finch, how are you?

122
00:07:59,957 --> 00:08:01,356
It' japanese

123
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:04,689
It means "hello."
Hello.

124
00:08:04,795 --> 00:08:09,323
- Finch, what happened to Latin?
- Met a Japanese girl at the art museum.

125
00:08:09,433 --> 00:08:13,699
Changed majors. Wanted to understand
all those things she was moaning.

126
00:08:13,804 --> 00:08:16,602
- You got laid in an art museum?
- The Met.

127
00:08:16,707 --> 00:08:20,165
- And the Guggenheim with Francesca.
- The Guggenheim?

128
00:08:20,277 --> 00:08:23,269
And then my social-psych professor
in Baskin-Robbins.

129
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,870
All right, enough.

130
00:08:24,982 --> 00:08:28,884
But I'll tell you,
none of these women even compare to--

131
00:08:28,986 --> 00:08:30,453
Stifler's mom.

132
00:08:31,922 --> 00:08:33,981
Stifler's mom is a goddess.

133
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:41,930
How about some more of Stifmeister's
collegiate concoction?

134
00:08:42,032 --> 00:08:45,763
This thing is like half alcohol.
You'rejust trying to get me drunk.

135
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:49,261
Mary, would I do that?

136
00:08:49,373 --> 00:08:53,901
- My name's Christy.
- Christy, right. Beautiful name.

137
00:08:54,011 --> 00:08:55,444
Like it matters.

138
00:08:55,546 --> 00:08:57,514
Hey, how you doing?

139
00:08:57,614 --> 00:08:59,741
Howdy-howdy, fuckin' partners!

140
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:02,284
Johnny C., how's it going?
Good to see you.

141
00:09:03,387 --> 00:09:05,480
Looks like someone
gained the freshman 1 5.

142
00:09:05,589 --> 00:09:07,580
- This'll help.
- You're an ass hole.

143
00:09:07,691 --> 00:09:08,919
Missed you too.

144
00:09:09,026 --> 00:09:12,860
All right, everybody
having a good time? Ladies.

145
00:09:14,031 --> 00:09:16,363
Fellas! How's it going?

146
00:09:16,466 --> 00:09:18,957
The keg's back there
as always. Enjoy.

147
00:09:19,069 --> 00:09:24,302
Ladies, I'm Steve Stifler
and I have an 1 1 -inch penis...

148
00:09:24,408 --> 00:09:26,535
around!

149
00:09:26,643 --> 00:09:29,874
Think about it.
Sherman!

150
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:33,040
Okay, Stifler,
takeyour shot.

151
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:36,085
Come on, man.
I'm really happy to seeyou.

152
00:09:37,354 --> 00:09:38,685
All right.

153
00:09:38,789 --> 00:09:40,620
You stupid fuck!

154
00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:45,028
- Areyou Steve Stifler?
- Yes, I am.

155
00:09:45,128 --> 00:09:47,096
Thankyou for throwing
this awesome party, man.

156
00:09:47,197 --> 00:09:50,166
- No problem.
- The cops bust all our parties now.

157
00:09:50,267 --> 00:09:54,636
Well, I put the word out
so high school chicks would come.

158
00:09:54,738 --> 00:09:58,435
Just 'causeyou fuckers don't have dicks
doesn't make it okay for you to be here.

159
00:10:00,544 --> 00:10:03,308
- Hey, could I askyou a question?
- Sure, son.

160
00:10:03,413 --> 00:10:07,110
Is it true that Paul Finch
nailed your mom?

161
00:10:08,986 --> 00:10:10,681
Sons ofbitches.

162
00:10:11,922 --> 00:10:13,617
My mom's a saint!

163
00:10:14,558 --> 00:10:16,185
Go choke some dick!

164
00:10:17,361 --> 00:10:19,329
Hey, Carlos,Jason.

165
00:10:19,429 --> 00:10:21,795
What's goin' on?
Keg's back on the deck.

166
00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:24,332
How was Iowa State?

167
00:10:24,434 --> 00:10:27,597
Did you see those fuckers
I had to boot out ofhere?

168
00:10:27,704 --> 00:10:31,401
Back at Stifler's.
Just like old times.

169
00:10:31,508 --> 00:10:32,907
One difference.

170
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:35,444
We're college men now.

171
00:10:35,545 --> 00:10:37,945
Some ofthese girls
are from the grade below us.

172
00:10:38,048 --> 00:10:40,141
I might actually have a chance.

173
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,241
Hey, I rememberyou.

174
00:10:44,721 --> 00:10:46,086
Doyou now?

175
00:10:46,189 --> 00:10:48,749
You're that guywho blew
his load on the Internet.

176
00:10:50,627 --> 00:10:53,528
Splat. "Oh, wait, Nadia,
don't go." Splat.

177
00:10:55,365 --> 00:10:57,060
- Pathetic.
- Loser.

178
00:10:57,734 --> 00:10:59,998
It's exactly like old times.

179
00:11:02,539 --> 00:11:05,201
- I'm gonna miss you.
- I'll miss you.

180
00:11:07,244 --> 00:11:09,303
I'll call you
when I get in, okay?

181
00:11:09,413 --> 00:11:10,710
Go have fun.

182
00:11:11,815 --> 00:11:13,214
Bye.

183
00:11:25,595 --> 00:11:25,696
I can't believe
those two girls, Kevin.

184
00:11:25,696 --> 00:11:27,891
I can't believe
those two girls, Kevin.

185
00:11:27,998 --> 00:11:29,898
Jim, it's not a big deal.

186
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,400
They toyed with my emotions.

187
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:35,663
- Hello. Hello.
- See? There's other girls.

188
00:11:35,772 --> 00:11:39,606
- How areyou?
- You got nothing to worry about, man.

189
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:41,678
Jessica's here.

190
00:11:42,913 --> 00:11:44,278
With Vicky.

191
00:11:44,981 --> 00:11:49,247
And Vicky got hot!

192
00:11:49,353 --> 00:11:51,913
What's that supposed to mean?

193
00:11:52,022 --> 00:11:53,250
Look at her.

194
00:11:53,357 --> 00:11:56,918
- Yeah,Jim, I see her.
- Hey, Kevin.

195
00:11:57,994 --> 00:11:59,825
I'll be right back.

196
00:12:02,566 --> 00:12:05,194
- Hey, Vic, how areyou?
- What's up?

197
00:12:05,302 --> 00:12:07,236
- I'm okay.
- Yeah, I'm good.

198
00:12:07,337 --> 00:12:08,326
That's good.

199
00:12:08,438 --> 00:12:10,633
- It's good to hear.
- Yeah, you too.

200
00:12:11,975 --> 00:12:13,533
Wow.

201
00:12:13,643 --> 00:12:16,407
Well, this is about as comfortable
as a high colonic in Tijuana.

202
00:12:16,513 --> 00:12:19,539
And I would know.
Okay.

203
00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:22,516
- I'm gonna get a drink.
- She's right.

204
00:12:22,619 --> 00:12:26,055
- Why is this so weird?
- Actually, I have no idea.

205
00:12:26,156 --> 00:12:29,523
See, I knew it.
I knewyou'd be mature about this.

206
00:12:29,626 --> 00:12:31,787
You know, and we could
still be friends, right?

207
00:12:32,896 --> 00:12:34,796
I miss you, Kev.

208
00:12:38,268 --> 00:12:39,360
Whoa.

209
00:12:41,004 --> 00:12:43,564
Friends, right?

210
00:12:43,673 --> 00:12:48,167
Yeah, right. I mean, I knowyou said
friends and I-- I just--

211
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:51,639
I'm sorry.
I was-- It wasjust...

212
00:12:51,748 --> 00:12:54,581
an old habit--
a friend kiss.

213
00:12:54,684 --> 00:12:56,117
Areyou sure?

214
00:12:56,219 --> 00:12:58,881
Vic, whywouldn't I wanna
be friends with you?

215
00:12:58,989 --> 00:13:02,390
Look, we'll--
we'll just do this, okay?

216
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,685
- Friends.
- Friends.

217
00:13:09,132 --> 00:13:11,726
- Ozzy, my man!
- There he is.

218
00:13:11,835 --> 00:13:14,804
Shake offyour chains ofmonogamy?
You're a free man.

219
00:13:14,905 --> 00:13:18,341
I don't think so, Stifler.
I'll never turn over to the dark side.

220
00:13:18,442 --> 00:13:21,775
Dumb ass. What happened to
the Nova I knew in high school?

221
00:13:21,878 --> 00:13:24,711
Nova, as in Casanova,
the guywho had all the moves.

222
00:13:24,815 --> 00:13:28,182
- He was an idiot.
- Yeah, but he was my idiot.

223
00:13:28,285 --> 00:13:31,083
Hey, everyone, listen up!

224
00:13:31,188 --> 00:13:33,247
Nova's back, baby...

225
00:13:33,356 --> 00:13:36,223
and he's taken the lock
offhis cock!

226
00:13:38,061 --> 00:13:40,723
Ozzy, I'm lobbing you a softball.

227
00:13:40,831 --> 00:13:43,095
Pull outyour bat
and take a swing.

228
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,428
Mandy.

229
00:13:45,635 --> 00:13:49,833
This is my friend, Oz.
All-state lacrosse twoyears running.

230
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:52,704
- Hi, Oz.
- Mandy, how areyou?

231
00:13:52,809 --> 00:13:55,505
Listen. I have a girlfriend.

232
00:13:55,612 --> 00:13:57,773
It was a pleasure meeting you.

233
00:13:58,548 --> 00:13:59,879
Beer out back.

234
00:14:01,952 --> 00:14:03,510
You pussy!

235
00:14:14,698 --> 00:14:16,928
Stifler's mom's room.

236
00:14:32,148 --> 00:14:34,708
How did you do
that magicyou did?

237
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,828
Tantra.

238
00:14:59,809 --> 00:15:01,902
What the fuck
areyou doin' in here?

239
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:04,740
-Just relax.
- You get out ofmy house!

240
00:15:04,848 --> 00:15:07,339
-Jesus Christ!
- Come back here, you little fucker!

241
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:09,611
- Come back here, you son ofa bitch!
- Take it easy.

242
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,018
Easy! Easy! That's enough.

243
00:15:13,123 --> 00:15:15,819
Okay, guys, we went through
this last summer, all right?

244
00:15:15,926 --> 00:15:18,190
Finch got a black eye
and Stifler got six stitches.

245
00:15:18,295 --> 00:15:19,660
'Cause he fuckin' bit me!

246
00:15:19,763 --> 00:15:21,196
You touch me, I bite.

247
00:15:21,298 --> 00:15:24,563
- You two relax and shake hands.
- Shake this.

248
00:15:28,605 --> 00:15:30,004
I need a drink.

249
00:15:30,106 --> 00:15:33,075
Why is everybody
taking a piss right now?

250
00:15:33,176 --> 00:15:36,771
-Line's too long. I ain't gonna make it.
-You'll be okay. Relax.

251
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,407
Hey, bro. Hey, man, you're
the guywho boned Stifler's mom.

252
00:15:40,517 --> 00:15:43,452
- Hey, you are a god.
- Holy shit, dude.

253
00:15:43,553 --> 00:15:47,353
IfI didn't have to hold my dick 'cause
I gotta piss, I would shakeyour hand.

254
00:15:47,457 --> 00:15:49,925
- I'm honored, guys.
- Don't leave.

255
00:15:50,026 --> 00:15:52,722
You must teach me.
How?

256
00:15:52,829 --> 00:15:53,693
How?

257
00:15:55,498 --> 00:15:57,591
Lookwhat I found, Christy.

258
00:15:58,735 --> 00:16:00,600
What a coincidence.

259
00:16:04,341 --> 00:16:06,176
I've been saving this
for a special occasion...

260
00:16:06,176 --> 00:16:07,473
I've been saving this
for a special occasion...

261
00:16:07,577 --> 00:16:08,178
for a special girl,
just likeyou.

262
00:16:08,178 --> 00:16:10,840
for a special girl,
just likeyou.

263
00:16:11,815 --> 00:16:14,340
- You're so sweet.
- That's what they say.

264
00:16:14,451 --> 00:16:15,850
Weird.

265
00:16:16,953 --> 00:16:19,217
- Oh, my God.
- I spilled some on you.

266
00:16:19,322 --> 00:16:21,552
- Maybe I should mop that up.
- Thanks.

267
00:16:21,658 --> 00:16:22,955
No problem.

268
00:16:23,059 --> 00:16:24,686
Whoa! Whoa, hey.

269
00:16:24,794 --> 00:16:27,922
- Take it slow. Come on.
- Right.

270
00:16:28,031 --> 00:16:31,364
You know, theywarn us
about these situations in college.

271
00:16:32,168 --> 00:16:36,434
Now, you may be intoxicated.

272
00:16:36,539 --> 00:16:38,507
Oh, yeah.

273
00:16:38,608 --> 00:16:41,338
Areyou certain thatyou wish
to engage in consenting--

274
00:16:41,444 --> 00:16:43,969
Hey, don't count
your chickens, buster.

275
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:48,244
- I'm just playing by the rules, baby.
- I make the rules.

276
00:16:48,351 --> 00:16:50,581
That's a pretty good fucking rule.

277
00:16:55,425 --> 00:16:58,121
Dude, the line's too long.
I'll never make it.

278
00:16:58,228 --> 00:17:00,128
- It's gotta happen now. Get my back.
- Go, bro.

279
00:17:07,671 --> 00:17:09,571
- Clamp it off.
- Hello.

280
00:17:11,007 --> 00:17:13,305
- How areyou?
- Awesome.

281
00:17:14,544 --> 00:17:16,444
- How areyou?
- I'm really good.

282
00:17:16,546 --> 00:17:20,004
How 'bout I giveyou
a little champagne?

283
00:17:20,116 --> 00:17:22,016
Go downstairs and get us some beers?

284
00:17:22,118 --> 00:17:25,383
I've got a surprise for you.
Closeyour eyes and get ready.

285
00:17:25,488 --> 00:17:27,046
I'm ready.

286
00:17:29,292 --> 00:17:31,760
- You want a beer?
- Yeah, all right.

287
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:37,565
Okay, go.

288
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:43,432
This is kind ofkinky,
and I like that.

289
00:17:49,045 --> 00:17:51,809
That's it.
Bathe the Stifmeister.

290
00:17:55,452 --> 00:17:57,181
Oh, that's great!

291
00:17:57,287 --> 00:17:59,448
That's great.

292
00:17:59,556 --> 00:18:01,547
How did you get it
so nice and warm?

293
00:18:05,628 --> 00:18:07,687
I can taste the bubbles.

294
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,128
Actually, I can't.

295
00:18:17,607 --> 00:18:19,302
Much better.

296
00:18:22,312 --> 00:18:23,540
Wait a second.

297
00:18:23,646 --> 00:18:26,410
- Let's go.
- Thanks, man.

298
00:18:32,555 --> 00:18:33,123
Oh, fuck!

299
00:18:33,123 --> 00:18:35,057
Oh, fuck!

300
00:18:37,761 --> 00:18:42,198
Yep. Halfthese got
East High parking passes on them.

301
00:18:42,298 --> 00:18:45,267
Gotta break up another one.
Call in a couple ofunits.

302
00:18:45,368 --> 00:18:48,337
- Isn't this the Stifler house?
- Yeah. Ever seen Ms. Stifler?

303
00:18:48,438 --> 00:18:51,635
- What a MI LF!
- Yeah? She got all that?

304
00:18:52,976 --> 00:18:54,637
Okay, now...

305
00:18:54,744 --> 00:18:59,306
do these high schoolers thinkwe're cool
because they're at a college party...

306
00:18:59,415 --> 00:19:02,543
or are we those weird older guys...

307
00:19:02,652 --> 00:19:05,177
that try to hang out with
high school kids when we come home?

308
00:19:05,288 --> 00:19:08,416
No way. We're definitely
not those guys.

309
00:19:08,525 --> 00:19:09,890
Cops! Cops!

310
00:19:11,361 --> 00:19:13,696
Break it up.
Party's over.

311
00:19:13,897 --> 00:19:15,194
Let's go.

312
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,227
Welcome back.

313
00:19:19,335 --> 00:19:21,530
Where's Steve Stifler?

314
00:19:27,744 --> 00:19:29,644
I got peed on.

315
00:19:31,114 --> 00:19:33,947
No, man,
Stifler's got shut down.

316
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:36,883
We can't party anywhere anymore.

317
00:19:36,986 --> 00:19:39,420
And things are--

318
00:19:39,522 --> 00:19:42,821
- Getting weird?
- Yeah, alittlebit.

319
00:19:42,926 --> 00:19:45,292
First summer back from college.

320
00:19:45,395 --> 00:19:48,193
Yep, things are gonna get weirder.

321
00:19:48,298 --> 00:19:51,631
- What areyou talkin' about?
- Well, times change, people change.

322
00:19:51,734 --> 00:19:53,634
It'sjust whathappens,
youknow.

323
00:19:53,736 --> 00:19:57,297
Kev, listen.
Go into my old room.

324
00:19:57,407 --> 00:20:01,002

329
00:20:13,289 --> 00:20:15,587

By the endofthesummer...

330
00:20:15,692 --> 00:20:18,525
you'regonnasee thebigpicture.

331
00:20:33,509 --> 00:20:36,967
-She's on the phone. It's long distance.
-Who?

332
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,672
- Nadia! Nadia!
- What?

333
00:20:38,781 --> 00:20:42,478
New York. Hello.
Yes, dear, he's right here.

334
00:20:42,585 --> 00:20:44,610
- Here. Wait.
- Now remember--

335
00:20:44,721 --> 00:20:47,884
Yes, I am sure to go
see the Lion King.

336
00:20:47,991 --> 00:20:51,017
Right. Anddon'tride
thesubwayaftermidnight.

337
00:20:51,127 --> 00:20:54,893
I know they've done wonderful things
with that city, but, you know, for me--

338
00:20:54,998 --> 00:20:58,058
- Dad!
- He's right-- Hang on.

339
00:21:03,339 --> 00:21:06,331
- How was college?
- College was excellent.

340
00:21:06,442 --> 00:21:09,377
Yeah. Yeah, it was--
it was really excellent.

341
00:21:09,479 --> 00:21:12,107
You have not forgotten
about me, haveyou?

342
00:21:12,215 --> 00:21:15,514
No. I--
Absolutely not.

343
00:21:15,618 --> 00:21:18,917
- Idefinitely didn't.
- Good, because guess what.

344
00:21:19,022 --> 00:21:21,183
I'm coming to seeyou
at the end ofsummer.

345
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:23,816
Ihopeyou're ready forme...

346
00:21:23,927 --> 00:21:28,523
because Ihavenotforgotten
aboutyoueither, yousexyboy.

347
00:21:28,631 --> 00:21:31,259
- Shit.
-Jim, you can eat hot dogs tomorrow.

348
00:21:31,401 --> 00:21:34,700
No, Finch,
it's not the hot dogs.

349
00:21:34,804 --> 00:21:36,704
Nadia called me this morning.

350
00:21:36,806 --> 00:21:39,969
She's coming here at the end of
the summer and she wants to see me.

351
00:21:40,076 --> 00:21:43,204
- That's killer.
- Yeah, that's a good thing.

352
00:21:43,313 --> 00:21:46,180
No, not "good thing."
Not "killer."

353
00:21:46,282 --> 00:21:48,375
I'll never be able to do it.

354
00:21:48,484 --> 00:21:52,352
Nadia is gonna be expecting
filet mignon.

355
00:21:52,455 --> 00:21:56,915
Okay, and all I'm gonna
be able to give her...

356
00:21:57,026 --> 00:21:58,584
is rump roast.

357
00:22:00,396 --> 00:22:04,730
Come on.Jim, you've had
experience since Nadia.

358
00:22:04,834 --> 00:22:06,734
Ah, yes, you would be
referring to...

359
00:22:06,836 --> 00:22:10,203
the flute-fetish band geek that made me
her bitch, then ditched me after prom.

360
00:22:10,306 --> 00:22:12,365
Yes, that's great experience.

361
00:22:12,475 --> 00:22:15,933
Youjust gotta
find the right girl,Jimbo.

362
00:22:16,045 --> 00:22:18,036
- Brings it all together.
- I had the right woman.

363
00:22:18,147 --> 00:22:22,174
Shejust sells her cottage
and takes offto parts unknown.

364
00:22:23,286 --> 00:22:25,880
My romantic life
has passed its peak.

365
00:22:25,989 --> 00:22:28,150
Take me out to the pasture
and shoot me.

366
00:22:28,257 --> 00:22:32,921
Super start to a super summer, fellas.
Welcome home.

367
00:22:34,664 --> 00:22:38,395
Guys, I got it.
Packyour bags.

368
00:22:38,501 --> 00:22:39,729
Forwhat?

369
00:22:39,836 --> 00:22:41,895
We're moving to the lake.

370
00:22:45,208 --> 00:22:48,371
We're gonna be the shit.
Everybody on the beach is gonna know us.

371
00:22:48,478 --> 00:22:51,174
Plenty ofopportunities
to practice for Nadia.

372
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,477
Throw a huge party at the end
ofthe summer to cap it all off.

373
00:22:54,584 --> 00:22:58,213
Dude, that's a great idea. That way
we'll be able to welcome Heather back...

374
00:22:58,321 --> 00:23:01,313
and we'll be able to prepare
for Nadia's big arrival.

375
00:23:01,424 --> 00:23:05,053
This is it.
This is my summer oflove.

376
00:23:05,161 --> 00:23:07,322
Just thought I'd say
good-bye toyou animals.

377
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:09,660
Hey, Mr. Levenstein.
How areyou, sir?

378
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:14,001
- All packed up, I see.
- We're all set, Dad.

379
00:23:14,103 --> 00:23:16,594
Don't worry, okay?
I'll be fine.

380
00:23:16,706 --> 00:23:18,640
Come on and give
your old man a hug.

381
00:23:30,386 --> 00:23:31,944
Keep it real, homies.

382
00:23:32,055 --> 00:23:34,216
You too, sir.
Have a good summer.

383
00:23:35,324 --> 00:23:37,519
All right, let's go.

384
00:23:37,627 --> 00:23:42,087
I've been running these numbers and
the four ofus can't afford this place.

385
00:23:42,198 --> 00:23:43,631
Not on summerjobs.

386
00:23:43,733 --> 00:23:45,928
Well, I kind ofthought ofthat.

387
00:23:46,102 --> 00:23:50,129
So, I invited someone else.

388
00:23:52,442 --> 00:23:56,344
Oh, yeah! The Stifmeister's
coming back to Grand Harbor!

389
00:23:56,446 --> 00:23:58,937
Deck the halls!
Bye-bye, Great Falls!

390
00:23:59,048 --> 00:24:01,278
Wipe my ass and lick my balls!

391
00:24:01,384 --> 00:24:03,614
It's Stifler time, baby!

392
00:24:17,767 --> 00:24:22,295
Stifler, ifyou're gonna be living
with us, you gotta behaveyourself.

393
00:24:22,405 --> 00:24:26,239
All right, you and Finch
just stay out ofeach other's way.

394
00:24:26,342 --> 00:24:29,072
Kevin, Stifler's stench
is unavoidable.

395
00:24:29,178 --> 00:24:31,237
Finch, fistyourself.

396
00:24:33,449 --> 00:24:35,474
That's right, baby.
We're here.

397
00:24:36,219 --> 00:24:38,278
Yeah, baby, we're here!

398
00:25:05,615 --> 00:25:08,448
- It's a palace.
- It's a temple.

399
00:25:11,387 --> 00:25:13,287
Isn't this great?

400
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:16,119
- Dude.
- Areyou kidding me?

401
00:25:32,475 --> 00:25:34,033
Thisjust won't do.

402
00:26:07,843 --> 00:26:09,242
Guys.

403
00:26:11,747 --> 00:26:14,477
Check this out.
This is it.

404
00:26:25,761 --> 00:26:28,355
Will you idiots tell me
what this fucker's doin'?

405
00:26:35,204 --> 00:26:36,865
Don't touch me
while I'm tantric.

406
00:26:36,973 --> 00:26:40,465
"Tantric?"
What the fuck is tantric?

407
00:26:40,576 --> 00:26:42,237
It's a Buddhist discipline.

408
00:26:42,345 --> 00:26:46,975
You learn to channel
your body's energies--your chakras.

409
00:26:47,083 --> 00:26:50,951
When you can do that, you can have sex
for hours, even days.

410
00:26:51,053 --> 00:26:52,543
And this stuff's for real?

411
00:26:52,655 --> 00:26:55,089
It's been around for centuries.

412
00:26:55,191 --> 00:26:57,523
With tantra you can make
an entire session ofsex...

413
00:26:57,627 --> 00:27:00,528
feel like one giant orgasm.

414
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:04,464
Eventually, you can sustain
that feeling by meditating.

415
00:27:04,567 --> 00:27:07,798
- Maybeyou can teach me sometime?
- Very doubtful.

416
00:27:07,903 --> 00:27:10,098
- True.
- Come on,Jim.

417
00:27:10,206 --> 00:27:13,403
- You can't possibly be that bad.
- Oh, no?

418
00:27:13,509 --> 00:27:15,704
No way.

419
00:27:15,811 --> 00:27:19,577
I guess there's only one person
that really knows for sure, huh?

420
00:27:19,682 --> 00:27:22,276
Oh, yeah?
Where is she this summer?

421
00:27:36,165 --> 00:27:39,430
Hey, areyou here for
the mid-session performance?

422
00:27:39,535 --> 00:27:41,662
Guests go in the amphitheater.
You can't be here.

423
00:27:41,771 --> 00:27:43,705
Doyou know where I
could find Michelle Flaherty?

424
00:27:43,806 --> 00:27:46,798
Guests bring food.
Food attracts animals. This one time...

425
00:27:46,909 --> 00:27:49,241
a bear came, and then the bear
had to be destroyed...

426
00:27:49,345 --> 00:27:52,246
which means they shot it in the head
with a rifle and killed it and it died.

427
00:27:53,015 --> 00:27:54,915
You must know Michelle.

428
00:27:55,017 --> 00:27:57,144
One, two, three, four.

429
00:28:15,504 --> 00:28:17,301
That's a lot offlutes.

430
00:28:22,011 --> 00:28:24,070
Good luck. Thanks.

431
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:26,842
Goodjob.
Have fun atyour next class.

432
00:28:33,055 --> 00:28:34,955
Jim. Holy potatoes!

433
00:28:35,825 --> 00:28:38,259
- You're really here?
- Everybody stick together.

434
00:28:38,361 --> 00:28:39,453
Oh, shoot!

435
00:28:39,562 --> 00:28:41,931
We're not supposed to
have visitors...

436
00:28:41,931 --> 00:28:42,295
We're not supposed to
have visitors...

437
00:28:42,398 --> 00:28:44,958
'cause this one time, here...

438
00:28:45,067 --> 00:28:45,234
this kid had these cookies--

439
00:28:45,234 --> 00:28:47,259
this kid had these cookies--

440
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:50,134
Let me guess. A bear came.

441
00:28:50,239 --> 00:28:51,297
Cool.

442
00:28:51,407 --> 00:28:53,637
It's likeyou know
all our stories.

443
00:28:55,578 --> 00:28:57,512
Was that a question?

444
00:28:57,613 --> 00:28:59,638
I don't know. Maybe.

445
00:28:59,749 --> 00:29:01,979
Doyou wanna answer it anyway?

446
00:29:03,352 --> 00:29:07,812
I leftyou like--
like three messages after prom.

447
00:29:07,923 --> 00:29:09,220
Really?

448
00:29:09,325 --> 00:29:14,627
You didn't think I was weird because
ofthe way I acted that night?

449
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:17,392
Weird, no.

450
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,525
Surprising, yes.

451
00:29:19,635 --> 00:29:22,001
I get nastywhen I'm horny.

452
00:29:22,104 --> 00:29:24,572
That's kind ofwhy I'm here.

453
00:29:26,142 --> 00:29:29,578
You remember,
was I any good that night?

454
00:29:29,678 --> 00:29:32,670
Wow. Geez.

455
00:29:32,782 --> 00:29:34,511
How could I forget?

456
00:29:34,617 --> 00:29:38,485
You sucked. You didn't know
what the hell you were doing.

457
00:29:38,587 --> 00:29:42,148
But wasn't it fun even though
you were so terrible?

458
00:29:42,258 --> 00:29:45,159
- I'm sorry. "Terrible?"
- I've had worse.

459
00:29:47,863 --> 00:29:48,955
Sorry.

460
00:29:49,064 --> 00:29:52,261
I could giveyou
some pointers ifyou want.

461
00:29:52,368 --> 00:29:53,665
Really?

462
00:29:55,471 --> 00:29:59,168
Shoot. Okay, wait here.
I'll meetyou in an hour, okay?

463
00:29:59,275 --> 00:30:01,140
- Yeah.
- Wait.

464
00:30:01,243 --> 00:30:03,336
Cool idea.

465
00:30:12,555 --> 00:30:14,785
What areyou doing?

466
00:30:17,326 --> 00:30:20,454
You're all right. Here we go. You know
you're not supposed to be here now.

467
00:30:20,563 --> 00:30:24,431
Everyone's supposed to be in
the amphitheater. All right, come on.

468
00:30:24,567 --> 00:30:26,967
It's piss poor to be this late.
I'm very angry right now.

469
00:30:27,069 --> 00:30:29,970
You can tell by the tone ofmyvoice
I'm angry. I'm pissed offis what I am.

470
00:30:30,072 --> 00:30:32,302
- Here they are. Got him home.
- Go, go.

471
00:30:32,408 --> 00:30:34,376
Wait a minute.
Areyou Petey?

472
00:30:36,178 --> 00:30:37,543
Yeah, sure.

473
00:30:37,646 --> 00:30:40,080
Petey!
Well, that explains everything.

474
00:30:40,182 --> 00:30:42,776
All right. Well, always something
with these kids. Go!

475
00:30:42,885 --> 00:30:47,083
We arejust so thrilled to haveyou.
None ofmy kids are atyour caliber.

476
00:30:47,189 --> 00:30:51,216
But we arejust so overjoyed to have
someone with your kind oftalent here.

477
00:30:51,327 --> 00:30:53,420
- Great.
- Hereyou go.

478
00:30:53,529 --> 00:30:55,622
Look at this.
Your old best friend.

479
00:30:55,731 --> 00:30:57,255
- Come on. Move.
- I know it's notyours...

480
00:30:57,366 --> 00:30:59,766
butyou are going to make
beautiful music.

481
00:30:59,869 --> 00:31:01,928
- Here we go.
- This is fantastic. I'm very excited.

482
00:31:02,037 --> 00:31:05,404
Youjust own this
and break a leg.

483
00:31:23,325 --> 00:31:25,190
What was he doing
wandering unsupervised?

484
00:31:25,294 --> 00:31:26,989
Who knows?

485
00:31:27,096 --> 00:31:30,623
I'll tell you something. I'm about
fed up with these Tall Oaks North kids.

486
00:31:37,239 --> 00:31:40,208
Kids, entertain yourselves.
Play along with Petey.

487
00:31:40,309 --> 00:31:43,107
No, no, no, Petey.
Here we go.

488
00:31:43,212 --> 00:31:45,646
All right, all right.
Come on, now. A little encouragement.

489
00:31:45,748 --> 00:31:48,478
Right to this spot.

490
00:31:48,584 --> 00:31:51,212
Folks, he'sjust a little nervous.

491
00:31:52,321 --> 00:31:54,118
This isn't right.

492
00:31:54,223 --> 00:31:56,123
Just blow on it, kid.
All right.

493
00:31:56,225 --> 00:31:57,783
Here we go.

494
00:32:06,435 --> 00:32:07,800
Come on, Petey.

495
00:32:09,705 --> 00:32:11,832
Play! Do something.

496
00:32:23,018 --> 00:32:24,986
Special, my ass.

497
00:32:25,087 --> 00:32:27,351
Come on. Give the little guy
some support.

498
00:32:29,758 --> 00:32:32,727
Come on, Petey.
You're doing great, partner.

499
00:32:34,196 --> 00:32:36,289
Come on, honey.
You can do it.

500
00:32:36,398 --> 00:32:37,990
Come on, Petey.

501
00:32:40,102 --> 00:32:41,660
What the hell.

502
00:32:45,774 --> 00:32:47,264
All right!

503
00:32:47,376 --> 00:32:51,278
All right, Petey!
Come on, now! Come on!

504
00:32:52,381 --> 00:32:54,178
Rock and roll!

505
00:33:37,326 --> 00:33:38,224
Thankyou!

506
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:43,130
Thankyou, Tall Oaks.
You're beautiful.

507
00:33:48,504 --> 00:33:50,404
My name is Petey!

508
00:33:51,507 --> 00:33:53,941
Thankyou!

509
00:33:54,743 --> 00:33:56,938
And I have gigantic balls!

510
00:34:14,697 --> 00:34:16,164
Not now!
Come back later. Go!

511
00:34:20,169 --> 00:34:22,467
Hey, hey, hey.
Come back here!

512
00:34:22,571 --> 00:34:25,802
- I wanna talk toyou!
- You are so sweet.

513
00:34:25,908 --> 00:34:28,809
He is special.

514
00:34:28,911 --> 00:34:31,345
He's my bitch.

515
00:34:33,182 --> 00:34:35,514
Well, Michelle has confirmed it.

516
00:34:35,617 --> 00:34:39,053
- I suck.
- What?

517
00:34:39,154 --> 00:34:41,918
I gotta get some practice.

518
00:34:42,024 --> 00:34:45,323
Don't worry about it. I mean,
that's whywe got the house,Jimbo.

519
00:34:45,427 --> 00:34:49,693
We plop a keg on the deck
and the girls come in offthe beach.

520
00:34:49,798 --> 00:34:52,892
It's like a hummingbird feeder.

521
00:34:53,001 --> 00:34:55,902
- You think so?
- I know so.

522
00:34:56,004 --> 00:34:57,869
Guaranteed hotties.

523
00:34:58,006 --> 00:35:00,600
Fellas, nice pad.

524
00:35:00,709 --> 00:35:03,644
Good view, but...

525
00:35:03,746 --> 00:35:07,147
the Sherminator sensors detect
no female life-forms in the vicinity.

526
00:35:07,249 --> 00:35:11,583
High likelihood of
a sausagefest in progress.

527
00:35:11,687 --> 00:35:14,019
The girls are coming.
I made some calls.

528
00:35:16,391 --> 00:35:19,622
The Sherminator's got a point, Kev.

529
00:35:19,728 --> 00:35:23,687
Since when doyou start listening
to the Sherminator?

530
00:35:23,799 --> 00:35:27,667
Since he made me realize
there's an abundance ofwiener here.

531
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:30,295
I mean, look around, dude.
Dude?

532
00:35:30,405 --> 00:35:32,566
All right,
now it's your turn.

533
00:35:32,674 --> 00:35:34,608
Come on.
There's nothing to tell.

534
00:35:35,711 --> 00:35:38,202
Hey, what's up?
What areyou guys talking about?

535
00:35:38,313 --> 00:35:40,508
Well, you know, we'rejust
trading war stories about college--

536
00:35:40,616 --> 00:35:43,016
who hooked up with who,
who slept with who--

537
00:35:43,118 --> 00:35:45,313
So, Vicky?

538
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:49,379
Well, there was this one guy.
How 'boutyou?

539
00:35:49,491 --> 00:35:52,119
You know, there was
a few girls--

540
00:35:52,227 --> 00:35:53,194
three.

541
00:35:53,295 --> 00:35:56,128
Look atyou.
You stud.

542
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:59,794
All right, Oz. Now that Kevin
told us, what aboutyou?

543
00:35:59,902 --> 00:36:03,338
You haven't had the slightest bit
ofattraction to any girl at school?

544
00:36:03,438 --> 00:36:06,271
Don'tyou fuckin' say no.
I knowyou did.

545
00:36:07,242 --> 00:36:09,301
Even ifI did...

546
00:36:09,411 --> 00:36:12,505
it wouldn't be anything more
thanjust a momentary thing.

547
00:36:12,614 --> 00:36:15,583
Very uninteresting.

548
00:36:15,684 --> 00:36:18,653
How aboutyou,Jessica? How many chicks
did you sleep with this year?

549
00:36:18,754 --> 00:36:20,551
Gee, wouldn'tyou like to know.

550
00:36:22,157 --> 00:36:23,590
Fuckyeah I would.

551
00:36:25,494 --> 00:36:26,791
Come on, Ozzy.

552
00:36:26,895 --> 00:36:29,295
Yeah, man. Ball.
Pool's yours.

553
00:36:29,398 --> 00:36:32,629
- Hey, Vic, you wanna play?
- Yeah, sure. You wanna break?

554
00:36:36,605 --> 00:36:38,072
What the--

555
00:36:38,173 --> 00:36:40,709
Where are the fuckin' females?

556
00:36:41,009 --> 00:36:44,713
Jim, can'tyou leaveyour shirt on?
You're scaring the chicks away.

557
00:36:44,713 --> 00:36:45,111
Jim, can'tyou leaveyour shirt on?
You're scaring the chicks away.

558
00:36:45,214 --> 00:36:47,375
Dude, give him a break.

559
00:36:49,184 --> 00:36:50,674
Ozzy, go deep.

560
00:36:50,786 --> 00:36:52,253
Yeah, bro. You playing?

561
00:36:55,824 --> 00:36:58,224
No, keep going.
Flank pattern.

562
00:36:58,327 --> 00:37:00,761
- What areyou doin'?
- Fishin'.

563
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:09,801
Areyou okay?

564
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:15,237
- You okay?
- I'm so sorry. Is everybody okay?

565
00:37:22,384 --> 00:37:23,715
Amazing.

566
00:37:26,622 --> 00:37:28,852
The Force is strong
in that one.

567
00:37:30,192 --> 00:37:31,216
Whoa.

568
00:37:32,294 --> 00:37:36,993
The Sherminator detects serious heat
at a distance oftwo meters.

569
00:37:37,099 --> 00:37:39,033
Prepare to deploy beer.

570
00:37:42,204 --> 00:37:45,696
Dude, let me giveyou a valuable
piece ofadvice, okay?

571
00:37:45,807 --> 00:37:47,434
Drop the whole
"Sherminator" thing.

572
00:37:47,542 --> 00:37:49,635
Please repeat previous statement.

573
00:37:49,745 --> 00:37:52,578
Look, I knowyour last name
is Sherman, right?

574
00:37:52,681 --> 00:37:57,744
And that rhymes with The Terminator
which was a big hit movie ten years ago.

575
00:37:57,853 --> 00:38:00,651
Butyou can't tell me
a girl's ever really gone for it.

576
00:38:01,556 --> 00:38:04,719
System overload.
Hasta la vista, Jessica.

577
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:09,258
Freak.

578
00:38:11,566 --> 00:38:14,399
Vic, hey, you guys are leaving?

579
00:38:14,503 --> 00:38:18,234
You know, we barely had a chance
to hang out, you know, catch up.

580
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:21,673
- What areyou doing this weekend?
- I can get together.

581
00:38:21,777 --> 00:38:24,007
- Cool. Let's hang out.
- All right.

582
00:38:24,112 --> 00:38:26,672
- Bye, Kev.
- Seeya,Jess.

583
00:38:29,918 --> 00:38:32,682
No, no, that's all wrong.

584
00:38:32,788 --> 00:38:35,916
- Thankyou. Have a nice day.
- Good-bye.

585
00:38:36,024 --> 00:38:38,959
- So what does he mean, "meet up"?
- You know, like hang out...

586
00:38:39,061 --> 00:38:40,551
grab lunch, whatever.

587
00:38:40,662 --> 00:38:44,291
I told you, we'rejust friends now.
And he totally understands.

588
00:38:44,399 --> 00:38:47,994
- I'm sure he understands quite well.
- He does.

589
00:38:48,103 --> 00:38:52,369
Oh, no, sir. These are all
wrong for you. I mean, seriously.

590
00:38:53,709 --> 00:38:55,472
Sure. Well, we're friends.

591
00:38:55,577 --> 00:38:59,035
But it's not like I see her
making plans with anyone else.

592
00:38:59,147 --> 00:39:02,742
I don't see herwith a boyfriend.
I think that puts me on deck.

593
00:39:03,919 --> 00:39:07,582
Hey, Vicky only slept with
one guy since we went out.

594
00:39:07,689 --> 00:39:12,092
I mean, that like makes me 50%
ofher entire guy-related life.

595
00:39:12,194 --> 00:39:14,128
You dipshit.

596
00:39:14,229 --> 00:39:17,392
She didn't sleep with one guy.
She slept with at least three.

597
00:39:17,499 --> 00:39:19,091
What?

598
00:39:19,201 --> 00:39:21,260
When a girl tells you
how many guys she slept with...

599
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:23,361
multiply it by three
and that's the real number.

600
00:39:23,472 --> 00:39:26,441
Didn'tyou fuckers
learn anything at college?

601
00:39:29,177 --> 00:39:32,237
He did not sleep with three girls,
much like Sly and the Family Stone...

602
00:39:32,347 --> 00:39:34,713
aren't gonna dance in here
and gang-bang me...

603
00:39:34,816 --> 00:39:37,307
between the afros
and the bell-bottoms.

604
00:39:37,419 --> 00:39:38,784
It's not gonna happen.

605
00:39:38,887 --> 00:39:42,721
- Kevin did not sleep with three girls.
- Whywould he lie to me?

606
00:39:42,824 --> 00:39:43,058
It's not a lie. It's an adjustment.
The rule ofthree.

607
00:39:43,058 --> 00:39:46,027
It's not a lie. It's an adjustment.
The rule ofthree.

608
00:39:46,128 --> 00:39:47,823
- The rule ofwhat?
- Three.

609
00:39:47,929 --> 00:39:51,490
A guy tells you how many girls he's
been with, it's not even close to that.

610
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,831
Take that number and divide it by three.
Then you get the real total.

611
00:39:54,936 --> 00:39:58,895
So, if Kevin's saying it's been three
girls, it's more like one, or none.

612
00:39:59,007 --> 00:40:01,532
- None?
- Rule ofthree.

613
00:40:01,643 --> 00:40:04,246
It's an exact science,
consistent as gravity.

614
00:40:05,447 --> 00:40:07,347
Ozzy, I'm happy for you.

615
00:40:07,449 --> 00:40:10,043
At leastyou've seen a nice bod
while Heather's offsuckin' dick.

616
00:40:10,152 --> 00:40:12,120
Keepyour fantasies toyourself.

617
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:14,620
Dude, useyour fuckin' brain.

618
00:40:14,723 --> 00:40:18,159
"I'm the American college chick.
La, la, la.

619
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:20,694
Your European cultural shit
is so charming.

620
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:24,465
Hot Spanish guy.
Loveyour accent.

621
00:40:24,566 --> 00:40:26,466
Loveyour ding-dong."

622
00:40:26,568 --> 00:40:30,527
I'm tellin' you, right now there
is a dick in your girlfriend's mouth.

623
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:33,767
- Knock it off.
- What'd I say?

624
00:40:52,761 --> 00:40:54,285
Oh, my God!

625
00:40:57,232 --> 00:41:00,292
Guys, check it out.
Lesbians.

626
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:04,005
Lesbians live here.

627
00:41:04,172 --> 00:41:06,663
You know,
Mr. Homophobic Wizard...

628
00:41:06,775 --> 00:41:10,939
that it is possible forwomen
to hold hands and not be gay.

629
00:41:11,046 --> 00:41:12,570
Friends can hold hands.

630
00:41:12,681 --> 00:41:16,913
Hey, Finch, I don't wanna hear aboutyou
and your boyfriends. Gojerk off.

631
00:41:17,018 --> 00:41:19,077
Unnecessary.

632
00:41:19,187 --> 00:41:21,655
Tantra teaches you to hold
an orgasm over time...

633
00:41:21,756 --> 00:41:24,190
in anticipation
ofan ultimate moment...

634
00:41:24,292 --> 00:41:26,692
to release it upon the world.

635
00:41:26,795 --> 00:41:29,025
I'm filling up to the brim.

636
00:41:29,131 --> 00:41:33,535
That's fucking disgusting!
I'm gonna throw up.

637
00:41:41,143 --> 00:41:42,872
Hey, Heather. You're in!

638
00:41:44,279 --> 00:41:45,769
How's the studying going?

639
00:41:45,881 --> 00:41:47,849
I'd hardly call it studying.

640
00:41:47,949 --> 00:41:52,318
I've been going to the Picasso Museum,
hanging out at Sagrada Familia...

641
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:54,820
going with Pierre
to the Parc Guell.

642
00:41:54,923 --> 00:41:57,391
- Who's Pierre?
- One ofthe guys in the program.

643
00:41:57,492 --> 00:42:00,290
He's got a girlfriend back in France, so
we've kind ofgot something in common.

644
00:42:00,395 --> 00:42:02,056
That sounds cool.

645
00:42:02,164 --> 00:42:06,396
Yeah, I've overheard them
on the phone at night.

646
00:42:06,501 --> 00:42:10,232
And, well, it made me think.

647
00:42:10,338 --> 00:42:14,172
Hey, Oz, I'm reaching undermyshirt
andI'm rubbing myself.

648
00:42:15,977 --> 00:42:19,242
Oz, come on. It's phone sex.
Help me out here.

649
00:42:19,347 --> 00:42:20,780
Okay.

650
00:42:23,718 --> 00:42:26,653
I'm going over to my bed.

651
00:42:27,789 --> 00:42:30,087
AndI'm lying down.

652
00:42:30,192 --> 00:42:32,626
And I'm slowly...

653
00:42:32,727 --> 00:42:36,094
reaching downstairs.

654
00:42:36,198 --> 00:42:37,927
Grab it.
Tell me how big it is.

655
00:42:39,334 --> 00:42:42,497
Listen, Heather,
I'm feeling kind ofawkward.

656
00:42:42,604 --> 00:42:46,335
Ifwe can't be with each other,
then we have to learn to be more vocal.

657
00:42:46,441 --> 00:42:48,841
- Right?
- Right. Okay.

658
00:42:48,944 --> 00:42:53,608
Okay, here we go.
I'm reaching in my pants now.

659
00:42:53,715 --> 00:42:55,410
And I'm rubbing it
for you, Heather.

660
00:42:55,517 --> 00:42:58,281
And it feels so good.

661
00:42:58,386 --> 00:43:00,650
- Yeah, me too.
- Oh, yeah.

662
00:43:00,755 --> 00:43:02,586
I got--

663
00:43:02,691 --> 00:43:03,851
Call waiting.

664
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,655
Oh, shit. Hello?

665
00:43:08,997 --> 00:43:10,396
Wrong number.

666
00:43:11,566 --> 00:43:13,466
Hey. Hello. Wrong number.

667
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:19,033
All right, look, man. I got
my hand on my dick right now, okay...

668
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:21,608
and I'm trying to have sex
with my girlfriend over the phone.

669
00:43:22,711 --> 00:43:24,611
Goodfor you, man.

670
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:31,675
Sorry about that.
Where were we?

671
00:43:31,786 --> 00:43:34,118
I thinkyou were
reaching for something.

672
00:43:34,222 --> 00:43:36,281
Oh, yeah.

673
00:43:36,391 --> 00:43:41,328
Oh, yeah, Heather. I'm rubbing it
and it feels so good.

674
00:43:42,297 --> 00:43:46,063
Hey, Oz, I'm touching myself.
What else doyou want me to do?

675
00:43:46,167 --> 00:43:48,567
Heather, baby.

676
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:51,468
Why don'tyou tell me my dick
is as big as Stifler's.

677
00:43:51,573 --> 00:43:52,631
Stifler, get off!.

678
00:43:52,741 --> 00:43:55,869
I am getting off
just listening to the two ofyou.

679
00:43:55,977 --> 00:43:58,741
- Keep going.
- We should try this another time.

680
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:01,748
Yeah, all right.
Bye. I loveyou.

681
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:05,081
- I loveyou.
- Come on you, guys. I was almost there!

682
00:44:05,186 --> 00:44:08,178
- Nice talking with you, Steven.
- Stifler, man!

683
00:44:09,724 --> 00:44:11,191
Repressed.

684
00:44:20,969 --> 00:44:22,493
Check it out.

685
00:44:22,604 --> 00:44:24,902
Potentiallesbians

686
00:44:33,315 --> 00:44:35,215
All right.
Now is my chance.

687
00:44:35,317 --> 00:44:37,911
I need confirmation.

688
00:44:38,019 --> 00:44:40,078
Stifler. Hey, man,
what areyou doing?

689
00:44:40,188 --> 00:44:41,883
Go get him.

690
00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:43,423
You ass.
Stifler, get out.

691
00:44:50,065 --> 00:44:53,626
Shit, dude!

692
00:44:54,736 --> 00:44:56,863
Big blue rubber dicks
for everyone!

693
00:44:56,971 --> 00:44:58,873
- The people demand rubber dicks!
- Finch, help.

694
00:44:58,873 --> 00:45:00,363
- The people demand rubber dicks!
- Finch, help.

695
00:45:00,475 --> 00:45:02,909

00:45:24,265 --> 00:45:26,495
Danielle, Amber, hi.

703
00:45:26,601 --> 00:45:29,570
Just needed the paper, huh?

704
00:45:32,073 --> 00:45:35,668
- Which room?
- I can't remember. I was too excited.

705
00:45:35,777 --> 00:45:38,302
- I'm in a lesbian stronghold.
- Was it in here?

706
00:45:38,413 --> 00:45:41,746
- Whyyou asking me so many questions?
- Was it in here?

707
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:44,546
- Maybe.
- Was it orwas it not here?

708
00:45:44,652 --> 00:45:47,450
Happy painting, boys.

709
00:45:48,923 --> 00:45:50,948
You gotta get out ofthere.
They're inside.

710
00:45:51,059 --> 00:45:52,253
Shit balls.

711
00:45:57,732 --> 00:46:01,031
- Very original, Steven.
- Don't call me Steven.

712
00:46:14,616 --> 00:46:16,880
I can wear that
little leopard bikini ofmine.

713
00:46:16,985 --> 00:46:19,647
I love that one.
It's so cute on you.

714
00:46:19,754 --> 00:46:21,244
Help me zip, please.

715
00:46:24,025 --> 00:46:28,121

Oh, man.

720
00:46:47,248 --> 00:46:51,344
Wait. They can't hear us inside?
We won't cross over their radio?

721
00:46:51,453 --> 00:46:54,581
No, man.

Two possible lesbians
in their bras and panties.

00:47:04,599 --> 00:47:05,691

- Don't touch me.
- I'm not.

728
00:47:25,887 --> 00:47:28,412
That better not have been
what I thought it was.

729
00:47:31,226 --> 00:47:33,251
This is not gonna fit.
Look atyou and look at me.

730
00:47:33,361 --> 00:47:36,592
- Too big.
- I'll getyou the blue stringy number.

731
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,265
JohnnyWest is missing.

732
00:47:42,871 --> 00:47:44,964
Maybeyou kicked it
under the bed.

733
00:47:47,108 --> 00:47:48,405
Okay, let me look.

734

Wait. Didn'tyou have it
when we were downstairs?

735
00:47:51,446 --> 00:47:52,811
Maybe.

736
00:47:56,684 --> 00:47:59,744
Guys, get the hell
out ofthere right now.

737
00:48:01,856 --> 00:48:02,754
Come on!

738
00:48:02,857 --> 00:48:05,223
- It's clear!
- Go, go, go!

739
00:48:10,899 --> 00:48:12,196
They're coming back.

740
00:48:18,006 --> 00:48:21,237
I'm just so glad I found him.
He's my favorite collectible.

741
00:48:21,342 --> 00:48:22,741
I know.

742
00:48:25,346 --> 00:48:28,042
Guys, we got nothin'
to worry about.

743
00:48:28,149 --> 00:48:31,050
I just remembered, I got that dildo
from the other bedroom.

744
00:48:34,889 --> 00:48:37,790
Holy shit!
There's a dildo in my drawer.

745
00:48:37,892 --> 00:48:41,521
Oh, my God! You could have
asked me ifyou wanted to borrow it.

746
00:48:42,730 --> 00:48:44,254
Stop it.

747
00:48:46,668 --> 00:48:49,831
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know. Call 91 1 .

748
00:48:53,541 --> 00:48:55,099
- No 91 1 .
- Don't call the police.

749
00:48:55,209 --> 00:48:59,043
- My God, it's the painting kids.
- I'm still calling the cops.

750
00:48:59,147 --> 00:49:01,115
Okay, no, no, no.
This isn't right.

751
00:49:01,215 --> 00:49:04,446
- Look. Stifler did break in here.
- You dick!

752
00:49:04,552 --> 00:49:07,077
But wejust followed him in
to get him out.

753
00:49:08,756 --> 00:49:11,384
I just wanted proofthatyou chicks
are really lesbians.

754
00:49:16,130 --> 00:49:19,099
You wanna mess with 'em?

755
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,065
Yeah, it'll be fun.

756
00:49:21,169 --> 00:49:23,262
- Let's do it.
- Let's do it.

757
00:49:24,372 --> 00:49:26,738
You guys like that?

758
00:49:34,682 --> 00:49:37,412
Ozzy, stand by for confirmation.

759
00:49:39,053 --> 00:49:41,647
That's a big 1 0-4
on the confirmation.

760
00:49:43,825 --> 00:49:46,851
Sounds likeyour little friends
outside wanna play too.

761
00:49:50,331 --> 00:49:52,231
You won't be needing this.

762
00:49:54,102 --> 00:49:56,002
Who wants me to touch Amber?

763
00:49:57,271 --> 00:49:58,761
Ido, Ido.

764

00:50:06,614 --> 00:50:09,276
I'm turning offmy radio now.

767
00:50:09,384 --> 00:50:13,650
Okay.

I know.
You feel his ass first.

771
00:50:30,471 --> 00:50:31,369
Excuse me?

772
00:50:31,472 --> 00:50:34,270
- Yeah, I like that. That's good.

775
00:50:40,682 --> 00:50:42,946
- What?
- I'm comfortable with my sexuality.

776
00:50:43,051 --> 00:50:45,485
And I would love
to see that show.

777
00:50:45,586 --> 00:50:47,713
Bravo!

778
00:50:51,225 --> 00:50:54,023
One finger on the cheek.

779
00:50:54,128 --> 00:50:56,153
We want...

780
00:50:56,264 --> 00:50:58,960
palm grasping.

781
00:51:00,068 --> 00:51:02,059
That's too much.
No, no, no.

782
00:51:02,170 --> 00:51:04,195
You don't touch,
we don't touch.

783
00:51:04,305 --> 00:51:07,741
- Squeeze his ass, son. You'll like it.
- Come on, boys.

784
00:51:07,842 --> 00:51:11,437
-Jesus Christ.
- Oh, shit.

785
00:51:13,881 --> 00:51:15,849
I'm touching his ass.
I'm touching his ass.

786
00:51:17,452 --> 00:51:19,477
Red Leader,
what's your position?

787
00:51:19,587 --> 00:51:22,488
I'm touchinghis ass.
I'm touchinghis ass.

788
00:51:22,590 --> 00:51:23,488
Mommy!

789
00:51:24,759 --> 00:51:25,851
We can go.

790
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:27,894
That reallywasn't bad.

791
00:51:27,995 --> 00:51:30,429
- I wanna go home.
- That's too bad.

792
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:35,167
Never mind.
I'm staying.

793
00:51:35,269 --> 00:51:37,703
Danielle is feeling my breasts.

794
00:51:40,308 --> 00:51:42,276
No way, dude!

795
00:51:42,376 --> 00:51:43,809
Herbreastsaresoluscious.

796
00:51:43,911 --> 00:51:46,311
What a wonderful Christmas gift
you bought the boys.

797
00:51:46,414 --> 00:51:49,178
Mynipplesaresohard.

798
00:51:50,451 --> 00:51:52,009
I think I can fix these.

799
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:00,151
SweetJesus.

800
00:52:02,296 --> 00:52:03,354
Your turn.

801
00:52:04,599 --> 00:52:06,032
Oh, yeah!

802
00:52:09,871 --> 00:52:10,860
Him.

803
00:52:15,243 --> 00:52:16,403
Kiss.

804
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:18,911
Dude, no.

805
00:52:19,013 --> 00:52:22,414
- Wait. What?
- Oh, yeah. You want more?

806
00:52:22,517 --> 00:52:24,985
We want more.
Go get him, tiger.

807
00:52:25,086 --> 00:52:27,884
- You're gonna love it.
- Do it for us.

808
00:52:31,025 --> 00:52:31,957
Okay, dude.

809
00:52:35,229 --> 00:52:37,129
One, two...

810
00:52:38,533 --> 00:52:40,433
three.

811
00:52:40,535 --> 00:52:43,595
- That doesn't even count.
- That totally counted.

812
00:52:43,704 --> 00:52:46,174
- That's howyou kiss your mother.
- Don'tyou say anything!

813
00:52:46,307 --> 00:52:47,399
Make it real.

814
00:52:47,508 --> 00:52:49,442
You do that...

815
00:52:49,544 --> 00:52:51,774
we'll do anything you want.

816
00:52:51,879 --> 00:52:53,244
Anything?

817
00:52:53,347 --> 00:52:54,746
Anything.

818
00:52:57,952 --> 00:52:59,180
You better like it.

819
00:52:59,287 --> 00:53:00,720
- Promise.
- I promise.

820
00:53:00,822 --> 00:53:02,722
I wouldn't lie.

821
00:53:04,325 --> 00:53:05,724
Come on.

822
00:53:09,630 --> 00:53:12,190
That is what I'm talking about.

823
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:15,133
Kev, you can look.

824
00:53:19,173 --> 00:53:21,038
That's it.

825
00:53:21,142 --> 00:53:22,871
Where's your tongue?

826
00:53:28,549 --> 00:53:30,039
Good boys.

827
00:53:30,151 --> 00:53:32,915
- Very good.
- Dude, you're a fucking lousy kisser.

828
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:34,954
What? I wasn't trying!

829
00:53:35,056 --> 00:53:36,921
That's not fair!

830
00:53:37,024 --> 00:53:38,992
I wasn't trying there.
I'm really--

831
00:53:39,093 --> 00:53:40,788
- I'm not--
- Nojudgment.

832
00:53:40,895 --> 00:53:43,659
- Nope.
- Wait a second. You were trying?

833
00:53:43,764 --> 00:53:46,232
- Fuck no!
- You were trying!

834
00:53:46,334 --> 00:53:49,132
- Oh, my-- That's disg--
- I kissedJim!

835
00:53:49,237 --> 00:53:51,137
Silence. Silence. Silence!

836
00:53:51,239 --> 00:53:53,332
- Ladies.
- Yes?

837
00:53:53,441 --> 00:53:55,500
As you were.

838
00:53:57,345 --> 00:53:59,245
- Here we go.
- Let's do it.

839
00:54:13,628 --> 00:54:17,086
Them girls sound like the two
transvestites we picked up in Biloxi.

840
00:54:17,198 --> 00:54:19,689
- Honey, come on. Food's ready.
- I'm not hungry!

841
00:54:29,443 --> 00:54:32,003
I can't believe this.
Okay,just do it.

842
00:54:34,916 --> 00:54:37,612
- Oh, God.
- It was worth it.

843
00:54:37,718 --> 00:54:39,117
Hello.

844
00:54:50,331 --> 00:54:51,992
Keep goin'.

845
00:54:55,937 --> 00:54:58,531
Okay, I think that's enough now.
That's good.

846
00:54:58,639 --> 00:55:02,040
- I want more.
- Hell, yeah. I want more too, baby.

847
00:55:03,945 --> 00:55:08,075
We're gonna get more physical
as soon as we get some--

848
00:55:09,617 --> 00:55:11,983
- Handjobs.
- Okay!

849
00:55:13,921 --> 00:55:15,218
Handjobs.

850
00:55:17,158 --> 00:55:20,423
You do him.
We love to watch.

851
00:55:21,696 --> 00:55:22,754
I'm sorry?

852
00:55:22,863 --> 00:55:25,024
- You go.
- We go.

853
00:55:29,837 --> 00:55:31,737
Don't be a wimp.

854
00:55:35,076 --> 00:55:37,510
Okay. It's okay.

855
00:55:37,611 --> 00:55:39,442
I know what I have to do.

856
00:55:40,281 --> 00:55:42,613
I need to keep this party goin'.

857
00:55:43,718 --> 00:55:46,187
I'm takin' one for the team.

858
00:55:47,088 --> 00:55:48,487
Mother ofGod!

859
00:55:48,589 --> 00:55:50,113
Come on, you pussies!

860
00:55:50,224 --> 00:55:52,886
- I am not touching that.
- Put that thing away, Stifler.

861
00:55:52,994 --> 00:55:56,225
Why can'tyou guys
be team players, huh?

862
00:55:56,330 --> 00:55:58,127
I was the one doin'
all the sacrificin'.

863
00:56:02,603 --> 00:56:06,198
And now for our devoted listeners,
back to the show.

864
00:56:08,309 --> 00:56:10,470
Letme try thatdildo.

865
00:56:13,147 --> 00:56:14,876
Now waitjust a minute.

866
00:56:14,982 --> 00:56:17,883
Stiflerwanted to give

867
00:56:17,985 --> 00:56:21,785
No. Stiflerwanted one from us.

868
00:56:21,889 --> 00:56:23,789
What? Bullshit.

869
00:56:23,891 --> 00:56:25,654
He did.
And it was horrible.

870
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:27,455
Very horrible.

871
00:56:27,561 --> 00:56:30,029
You guys, you wanna
play some "asshole"?

872
00:56:30,131 --> 00:56:32,759
Just watching the game, Kev.

873
00:56:32,867 --> 00:56:34,926
I just wanna
do something together.

874
00:56:35,036 --> 00:56:37,129
Wejust did something together.

875
00:56:37,238 --> 00:56:40,207
- Very together.
- Ho, ho, ho.

876
00:56:40,307 --> 00:56:42,366
Stifler Claus is here.

877
00:56:42,476 --> 00:56:45,309
Now,just so there's no confusion...

878
00:56:45,413 --> 00:56:48,814
Santa Porn hasjust brought us
some heterosexual entertainment.

879
00:56:50,551 --> 00:56:51,449
Hereyou go.

880
00:56:52,653 --> 00:56:54,450
All right. Here.

881

And the Stifmeister's provided us
some complimentary lubricant.

882
00:56:57,391 --> 00:56:59,325
Whack away,Jim. Whack away.

883
00:56:59,427 --> 00:57:01,190
Does this stuffreally
make a difference?

884
00:57:01,295 --> 00:57:02,762
Oh, yeah!

885
00:57:02,863 --> 00:57:04,057
Really?

886
00:57:09,804 --> 00:57:12,204
Stifmeister's palace oflove--

887
00:57:12,306 --> 00:57:13,864
straight love.

888
00:57:15,076 --> 00:57:17,943
Oh, hey.
Yeah, I'm fine.

889
00:57:18,045 --> 00:57:19,706
- How aboutyou?
- That's Stifler's mom.

890
00:57:19,814 --> 00:57:21,213
Silence.

891
00:57:21,315 --> 00:57:23,306
I didn't really thinkyou were gonna be
in Michigan this summer.

892
00:57:23,417 --> 00:57:25,408
Yeah, you're more than welcome
to be here.

893
00:57:25,519 --> 00:57:28,886
Okay, stop by in a couple ofweeks.
We're having a big party.

894
00:57:28,989 --> 00:57:30,581
Okay, bye.

895
00:57:30,691 --> 00:57:32,056
Stifler, was that--

896
00:57:35,629 --> 00:57:37,187
She's coming.

897
00:57:41,936 --> 00:57:43,961
Stifler's mom is coming here.

898
00:57:47,108 --> 00:57:49,099
Efforts must be doubled.

899
00:57:50,544 --> 00:57:52,478
"Efforts must be doubled."

900
00:57:54,915 --> 00:57:56,212
Absolutely.

901
00:58:03,691 --> 00:58:05,591
Jenny, where'd you put
my clarinet?

902
00:58:05,693 --> 00:58:08,287
- I think I shoved it in your box.
- Thanks.

903
00:58:08,395 --> 00:58:12,263
Bad man.
I'm a bad, bad man.

904
00:58:16,270 --> 00:58:18,238
Jim, what areyou
doing here?

905
00:58:18,339 --> 00:58:20,807
I-- Well, I thought
you had said--

906
00:58:20,908 --> 00:58:23,638
You can'tjust
stand out here.

907
00:58:23,744 --> 00:58:27,578
Look, I need your help.

908
00:58:27,681 --> 00:58:29,774
Nadia's coming back...

909
00:58:29,884 --> 00:58:31,784
and I don't--

910
00:58:31,886 --> 00:58:33,945
I don't wanna be this awkward...

911
00:58:34,054 --> 00:58:37,114
bumbling, nervous guywith her.

912
00:58:37,224 --> 00:58:38,859
I don't wanna seem
like a dork.

913
00:58:38,959 --> 00:58:41,154
Well, I know that feeling.

914
00:58:41,262 --> 00:58:43,355
Spend your life playing
in the band...

915
00:58:43,464 --> 00:58:47,457
it doesn't exactly giveyou
the ultra-cool hipster image.

916
00:58:47,568 --> 00:58:51,197
- I thinkyou're pretty cool.
- Seriously?

917
00:58:55,643 --> 00:58:58,976
Michelle, why did you
ditch me after prom?

918
00:58:59,079 --> 00:59:03,072
I didn't ditch you.
I just--

919
00:59:03,184 --> 00:59:04,617
Our date was over.

920
00:59:05,519 --> 00:59:07,749
I mean, did you want some...

921
00:59:07,855 --> 00:59:10,415
funky, weird,
next-morning good-bye?

922
00:59:12,226 --> 00:59:15,821
It's not like I wanted you to pretend
you were in love with me or something.

923
00:59:15,930 --> 00:59:17,795
Whywould I pretend that?

924
00:59:17,898 --> 00:59:19,593
Guys do that.

925
00:59:20,968 --> 00:59:24,529
Yeah, well,
I'm not like other guys.

926
00:59:25,639 --> 00:59:27,300
I know.

927
00:59:27,408 --> 00:59:30,536
Okay, I'm gonna helpyou.

928
00:59:30,644 --> 00:59:32,544
Really?

929
00:59:32,646 --> 00:59:35,308
Yeah, I feel bad
for saying thatyou sucked...

930
00:59:35,416 --> 00:59:38,442
even though you kind ofdid.

931
00:59:41,021 --> 00:59:43,114
I'm just--

932
00:59:43,224 --> 00:59:45,124
Let'sjust get started.

933
00:59:46,227 --> 00:59:48,695
- Now, I'm a hot girl.
- Right.

934
00:59:48,796 --> 00:59:51,697
- Okay, what doyou wanna do?
- I wanna feel your boobs.

935
00:59:51,799 --> 00:59:53,824
No, you dingbat.

936
00:59:53,934 --> 00:59:56,437
You don'tjust go
groping away.

937
00:59:56,437 --> 00:59:56,766
You don'tjust go
groping away.

938
00:59:56,870 --> 00:59:59,940
You gotta preheat the oven
beforeyou stick in the turkey.

939
01:00:03,611 --> 01:00:05,101
Kiss me, here.

940
01:00:11,385 --> 01:00:13,444
Good. Okay, now...

941
01:00:13,554 --> 01:00:15,044
the collarbone-- kiss.

942
01:00:19,827 --> 01:00:22,421
Good,Jim.

943
01:00:22,529 --> 01:00:23,962
You're making me wet.

944
01:00:24,064 --> 01:00:25,395
Holy shit. Really?

945
01:00:25,499 --> 01:00:27,626
No, I wasjust saying that
soyou could practice.

946
01:00:29,503 --> 01:00:30,993
Ofcourse.

947
01:00:51,625 --> 01:00:56,153
Does direction matter,
like clockwise, counterclockwise?

948
01:00:56,263 --> 01:00:58,697
Okay,Jim,
this is what I'm talking about.

949
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:03,065
Your main problem is
you're so uptight.

950
01:01:04,305 --> 01:01:07,741
Do I seem uptight
about my sexual stuff? No.

951
01:01:07,841 --> 01:01:11,038
The biggest pointer
I could giveyou is...

952
01:01:11,145 --> 01:01:15,639
you have to feel comfortable
in any situation.

953
01:01:15,749 --> 01:01:17,051
Stand up.

954
01:01:18,052 --> 01:01:18,950
Stand up.

955
01:01:20,354 --> 01:01:24,051
- Now, this is a fucked-up situation.
- What happened to preheating?

956
01:01:24,158 --> 01:01:26,752
- We're skipping a few chapters.
- Oh, okay.

957
01:01:26,860 --> 01:01:30,591
This is good. This is good.
Obviously.

958
01:01:32,132 --> 01:01:35,499
- Gilligan's Island, Mr. Howell.
- What?

959
01:01:35,602 --> 01:01:39,436
You've got to control yourself
and think ofsomething nonsexual.

960
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:43,067
I haven't even touched you yet,
and you're turning into the Sears Tower.

961
01:01:43,177 --> 01:01:46,044
I'm sorry.
Yeah, nonsexual.

962
01:01:46,146 --> 01:01:48,740
Right, right.
Okay.

963
01:01:48,849 --> 01:01:51,647
- Chairs.
- Good.

964
01:01:54,521 --> 01:01:55,647
Mastodons.

965
01:01:58,359 --> 01:02:00,554
Cleaning my bathroom.

966
01:02:01,795 --> 01:02:03,786
- Dung beetles.
- Good.

967
01:02:03,897 --> 01:02:06,388
- Yeah.
- Okay. Now, don't freak out.

968
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:09,492
I'm gonna do something
to push your threshold.

969
01:02:09,603 --> 01:02:11,572
Oh, that's cold!
What areyou doing?

970
01:02:11,572 --> 01:02:12,004
Oh, that's cold!
What areyou doing?

971
01:02:12,106 --> 01:02:15,075
I just shoved a trumpet in your ass.
Aren't instruments fun?

972
01:02:15,342 --> 01:02:18,743
Okay, I thinkyou'vejust
crossed my threshold.

973
01:02:28,455 --> 01:02:32,186
Call me in two weeks. I'll be home then.
We can finish lessons.

974
01:02:32,292 --> 01:02:34,089
Okay.

975
01:02:38,732 --> 01:02:40,757
Pointer--
less tongue.

976
01:02:59,453 --> 01:03:02,616
- What is it? A guest book?
- Yeah, and look at this entry.

977
01:03:02,723 --> 01:03:05,419
"Best thing was the blowout
at Tom Meyers' place.

978
01:03:05,526 --> 01:03:07,892
- There he is.
- A night not soon to be forgotten.

979
01:03:07,995 --> 01:03:10,623
August '93."
It's your brother, man. Look.

980
01:03:10,731 --> 01:03:12,562
Yeah, his cottage was
right down on the beach.

981
01:03:12,666 --> 01:03:16,227
Guys, this is what
our party's gotta be.

982
01:03:16,336 --> 01:03:19,066
- Something we'll always remember.
- Yes, definitely.

983
01:03:19,173 --> 01:03:20,731
Absolutely.

984
01:03:22,342 --> 01:03:24,970
- You go fish.
- Finch, we're playing gin.

985
01:03:28,949 --> 01:03:29,817
Gin.

986
01:03:29,817 --> 01:03:30,306
Gin.

987
01:04:21,535 --> 01:04:22,934
What the fuck?

988
01:05:02,676 --> 01:05:03,911
"DearJim.

989
01:05:05,712 --> 01:05:09,443
Chicago is beautiful,
but it would be better ifyou were here.

990
01:05:09,550 --> 01:05:12,383
I'm counting the days.
Love, Nadia."

991
01:05:15,355 --> 01:05:17,823
Well, I wish
you were here, Nadia.

992
01:05:46,093 --> 01:05:49,620
- Haveyoubeen dirty?
- Oh, yes, baby. I'vebeen dirty.

993
01:05:51,732 --> 01:05:53,632
Doyou wantme to cleanyou?

994
01:05:53,734 --> 01:05:57,431
"Apply a few drops
to achieve desired lubrication."

995
01:05:57,538 --> 01:05:59,199
All right.

996
01:06:03,377 --> 01:06:06,869
Is thataloofah,
orareyoujustgladtoseeme?

997
01:06:06,981 --> 01:06:08,881
What the hell.

998
01:06:27,735 --> 01:06:29,464
Shit.

999
01:06:33,674 --> 01:06:36,006
God!

1000
01:06:36,110 --> 01:06:38,169
I been missin' out.

1001
01:06:56,530 --> 01:06:58,327
Oh, shit!

1002
01:07:04,505 --> 01:07:05,631
Shit!

1003
01:07:11,912 --> 01:07:14,642
- Everybody okay?
- I'm fine.

1004
01:07:14,748 --> 01:07:16,409
I'm fine.
Everything's fine.

1005
01:07:16,517 --> 01:07:19,315
Shut the fuck up or I'll break down
this door and pummel your ass!

1006
01:07:19,420 --> 01:07:23,220
No, don't come in here. I'm fine.
I just fell out ofthe bed.

1007
01:07:23,324 --> 01:07:25,224
- You sure?
- Okay, good night, then.

1008
01:07:25,326 --> 01:07:27,260
- 'Night.
- We'll seeyou in the morning.

1009
01:07:41,308 --> 01:07:42,605
Shit!
Oh, shit!

1010
01:08:07,835 --> 01:08:09,962
- Poison control.
- Hello?

1011
01:08:14,608 --> 01:08:16,803
Yeah, I kind of...

1012
01:08:16,910 --> 01:08:18,741
Super Glued myself...

1013
01:08:18,846 --> 01:08:21,582
to myself.

1014
01:08:24,918 --> 01:08:26,613
Don't send an ambulance.

1015
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:30,781
Look, is there anything, you know,
around the house?

1016
01:08:34,528 --> 01:08:36,928
Paint thinner.

1017
01:09:32,519 --> 01:09:33,850
Shit.

1018
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:43,158
Don't move!
Staywhereyou are!

1019
01:09:43,263 --> 01:09:45,697
Hands where we can see 'em!

1020
01:09:45,799 --> 01:09:48,359
Both hands!
Get the other hand up, goddamn it!

1021
01:09:49,937 --> 01:09:52,337
I can't! I can't!
I'm glued!

1022
01:09:52,439 --> 01:09:56,432
I'm glued!
Sorry.

1023
01:09:56,543 --> 01:09:59,478
Relaxyour hands.

1024
01:09:59,580 --> 01:10:02,481
I'll take it from here, okay?

1025
01:10:02,583 --> 01:10:04,517
Don't worry,Jimbo.
You're gonna be fine, buddy.

1026
01:10:04,618 --> 01:10:07,178
Jim, this happens
to the best ofus.

1027
01:10:12,326 --> 01:10:15,124
Left foot first.
Easy does it. Good.

1028
01:10:15,229 --> 01:10:18,892
- Watch your head.
- All right. Take a seat.

1029
01:10:20,868 --> 01:10:23,234
Excuse me, sir.
Areyou a family member?

1030
01:10:23,337 --> 01:10:25,862
Fuck, no!
This isjust too good to miss!

1031
01:10:25,973 --> 01:10:28,806
Okay, sir, you'rejust gonna have
to wait here. All right?

1032
01:10:36,150 --> 01:10:38,277
This summer's
turned out to be great.

1033
01:10:53,467 --> 01:10:57,301
Mucilage is, uh,
dangerous territory...

1034
01:10:57,404 --> 01:11:01,966
and I would think
any adhesive product...

1035
01:11:02,075 --> 01:11:05,010
would have a warning
right on the tube.

1036
01:11:06,213 --> 01:11:08,977
I thought it was a lubricant.

1037
01:11:09,082 --> 01:11:11,346
I was trying to use...

1038
01:11:11,451 --> 01:11:12,975
lubricant.

1039
01:11:19,493 --> 01:11:22,792
Son, couldn'tyou have left
that disgusting thing at home?

1040
01:11:24,264 --> 01:11:26,198
Excuse me?

1041
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:29,497
Well, that kind ofmaterial
is offensive to me.

1042
01:11:29,603 --> 01:11:33,004
Oh, well, we're sorry.

1043
01:11:34,208 --> 01:11:37,143
But, you see,
my son couldn't leave it at home...

1044
01:11:37,244 --> 01:11:40,475
because he's having
a bit ofa medical emergency.

1045
01:11:40,581 --> 01:11:41,479
Thanks, Dad.

1046
01:11:41,582 --> 01:11:44,881
Your opinion ofhis taste
in video rentals, I'm afraid...

1047
01:11:44,985 --> 01:11:46,976
is not a priority, lady.

1048
01:11:47,087 --> 01:11:48,486
Okay, Dad.

1049
01:11:48,589 --> 01:11:51,217
It's at the bottom
ofthe totem pole.

1050
01:11:53,894 --> 01:11:55,794
Thankyou. Okay?

1051
01:11:55,896 --> 01:11:57,830
My son...

1052
01:11:57,931 --> 01:11:59,899
is sitting here right now...

1053
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,696
with his hand
glued to his penis!

1054
01:12:04,171 --> 01:12:06,366
But that doesn't mean
anything toyou, does it?

1055
01:12:06,473 --> 01:12:08,737
Becauseyou don't have a penis!

1056
01:12:08,842 --> 01:12:10,742
- Or maybeyou do!
- Dad!

1057
01:12:10,844 --> 01:12:13,278
Sorry. I'm sorry.

1058
01:12:13,380 --> 01:12:16,543
You know, itjust bugs me
when people speak...

1059
01:12:16,650 --> 01:12:18,550
before they think.

1060
01:12:18,652 --> 01:12:21,177
You know, ifthey speak.

1061
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:29,087
- Howyou doin', son?
- I've been better.

1062
01:12:32,499 --> 01:12:35,059
Boy, that doesn't look
too bad,Jim.

1063
01:12:35,168 --> 01:12:37,159
Goodjob, Doctor.

1064
01:12:37,271 --> 01:12:40,468
The swelling should subside
in about eight or nine days.

1065
01:12:40,574 --> 01:12:42,235
Eight or nine--

1066
01:12:43,777 --> 01:12:46,575
Beach party's in a week.
Nadia's coming.

1067
01:12:50,617 --> 01:12:54,246
Doctor, my son has
a party in seven days...

1068
01:12:54,354 --> 01:12:56,379
and there's a young lady coming...

1069
01:12:56,490 --> 01:12:58,617
that he's been waiting to--

1070
01:13:00,494 --> 01:13:02,792
he's been waiting to get with.

1071
01:13:02,896 --> 01:13:06,354
I'd tell your son to keep
his pants on during that party.

1072
01:13:06,466 --> 01:13:10,334
Oh, yes. Believe me, I will be
doing that. It goes without saying.

1073
01:13:10,437 --> 01:13:12,962
But ifhis pants...

1074
01:13:13,073 --> 01:13:15,234
decide to come off
during the party...

1075
01:13:15,342 --> 01:13:18,402
could he have
full use ofhis...

1076
01:13:21,114 --> 01:13:22,138
penis?

1077
01:13:22,249 --> 01:13:23,807
Okay.

1078
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:28,750
This should shave
a couple ofdays off.

1079
01:13:28,855 --> 01:13:31,449
Oh, good.

1080
01:13:31,558 --> 01:13:33,583
Thankyou, Doctor.

1081
01:13:33,694 --> 01:13:36,060
Jim...

1082
01:13:36,163 --> 01:13:38,927
that's good news.

1083
01:13:39,032 --> 01:13:42,593
This has been a good-news day, son.
Here. Put this on.

1084
01:13:42,703 --> 01:13:44,193
Little chilly out there.

1085
01:13:46,673 --> 01:13:49,403
Well, here we are.

1086
01:13:49,509 --> 01:13:51,500
You know,Jim...

1087
01:13:51,611 --> 01:13:55,308
I thinkwe should keepyour mother
in the dark about the incident tonight.

1088
01:13:55,415 --> 01:13:58,782
I think the whole glue thing
might get her a little queasy.

1089
01:13:58,885 --> 01:14:02,377
I don't know how I get
myselfinto these things.

1090
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:08,187
But thanks for understanding.

1091
01:14:08,295 --> 01:14:10,923
You've been really cool.

1092
01:14:11,031 --> 01:14:13,022
I mean, between this and...

1093
01:14:13,133 --> 01:14:14,862
you know--

1094
01:14:16,970 --> 01:14:20,997
You know, you may be
Jimbo orJumbo...

1095
01:14:21,108 --> 01:14:24,202
orJimbodinny to these guys
in here, but...

1096
01:14:24,311 --> 01:14:26,973
I wantyou to know
there are two people...

1097
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:30,516
who still rememberwhere
James Emanuel Levenstein came from.

1098
01:14:32,419 --> 01:14:35,582
We're awful proud ofyou, son.

1099
01:14:35,689 --> 01:14:37,418
Thanks, Dad.

1100
01:14:37,591 --> 01:14:40,389
Don't forgetyour penis cream.

1101
01:15:00,614 --> 01:15:02,707
That was it.

1102
01:15:02,816 --> 01:15:06,718
Right there.
That was a pure tantric moment.

1103
01:15:06,820 --> 01:15:10,688
The ficus, the water--
it was all erotic.

1104
01:15:10,791 --> 01:15:15,558
One more stimulant,
I would have had full release.

1105
01:15:15,662 --> 01:15:19,826
Finch, stay the fuck
away from that ficus.

1106
01:15:19,933 --> 01:15:21,560
That's ajizz-free ficus.

1107
01:15:23,937 --> 01:15:28,067
There he is. Morning,Jimbo.
How's the twig and giggleberries, man?

1108
01:15:28,175 --> 01:15:31,511
Oh, very colorful.
My dick looks like a paint-by-numbers.

1109
01:15:33,747 --> 01:15:36,545
You're the only guy I know
whose dick needs an instruction manual.

1110
01:15:48,028 --> 01:15:50,861
What, you're here now?
No, that's cool.

1111
01:15:50,964 --> 01:15:53,558
You know, ifyou want to
hang out with these guys.

1112
01:15:53,667 --> 01:15:55,862
Okay, then.
I'll meetyou out front.

1113
01:15:59,005 --> 01:16:01,872
- Hey, Stifler, was that--
- Eat shit, Shitbreak.

1114
01:16:05,412 --> 01:16:06,379
She's here.

1115
01:16:08,815 --> 01:16:11,443
My lady has arrived.

1116
01:16:13,854 --> 01:16:16,550
- I gotta prepare.
- Here we go.

1117
01:16:16,656 --> 01:16:19,784
- Great. Stifler's mom is here?
- This could be a disaster.

1118
01:16:23,096 --> 01:16:25,656
Not unless Stifler's mom
drives a moped.

1119
01:16:25,765 --> 01:16:26,789
Moped?

1120
01:16:30,370 --> 01:16:33,828
Fuckers, fuckers, fuckers.
Howyou doin', boys?

1121
01:16:33,940 --> 01:16:37,307
- That's Stifler's little brother.
- What areyou doing here?

1122
01:16:37,410 --> 01:16:39,901
Pussy, man.
I'm here for the pussy.

1123
01:16:40,013 --> 01:16:41,776
Take a number.

1124
01:16:41,882 --> 01:16:45,409
Gentlemen, why all the noise?
Everybody knows this is my special day.

1125
01:16:45,519 --> 01:16:48,147
- What is that?
- Is that a fuckin' dress?

1126
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:52,885
- Areyou wearing a dress?
- Shitbreak, meet my little brother.

1127
01:16:52,993 --> 01:16:54,688
Little brother, meet Shitbreak.

1128
01:16:55,929 --> 01:16:58,124
- That's your brother?
- Yes.

1129
01:17:00,967 --> 01:17:02,628
My lady's not coming.

1130
01:17:04,571 --> 01:17:07,438
So my entire...

1131
01:17:07,541 --> 01:17:09,566
stockpile is wasted...

1132
01:17:09,676 --> 01:17:11,940
and I look ridiculous!

1133
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:15,038
Excuse me.

1134
01:17:20,487 --> 01:17:22,853
- That didn't look too good.
- No.

1135
01:17:22,956 --> 01:17:27,916
- Let's go find your room.
- So, where are the fuckin' females?

1136
01:17:30,864 --> 01:17:33,332
I can't believe
I finally gotyou alone.

1137
01:17:33,433 --> 01:17:35,492
That only took, what, six weeks?

1138
01:17:36,670 --> 01:17:39,332
So, areyou alone too?

1139
01:17:39,439 --> 01:17:41,907
- Yep.
- Good.

1140
01:17:42,008 --> 01:17:45,671
I'm all alone.

1141
01:17:45,779 --> 01:17:48,543
Guess what I had in mind?

1142
01:17:51,818 --> 01:17:54,252
Hey, Marco,
can you getyour balls offme?

1143
01:17:54,354 --> 01:17:57,323
- Thanks.
- What the hell's going on over there?

1144
01:17:57,424 --> 01:18:01,360
Nothing.
It'sjust my flatmates.

1145
01:18:01,461 --> 01:18:03,429
I guess this is kind of
a lost cause, huh?

1146
01:18:03,530 --> 01:18:05,623
- Yeah, I guess so.
- Seeya this weekend?

1147
01:18:05,732 --> 01:18:07,757
- I can't wait.
- I can't wait either.

1148
01:18:07,867 --> 01:18:09,027
Bye-bye.

1149
01:18:13,974 --> 01:18:16,704
- Surprise!
- Holy-- Nadia!

1150
01:18:16,810 --> 01:18:20,211
You're here? You're here.
What areyou doing here?

1151
01:18:20,313 --> 01:18:22,247
Jim, I got so tired
ofsightseeing.

1152
01:18:22,349 --> 01:18:24,681
Butyou're--you're early.

1153
01:18:24,784 --> 01:18:28,515
Okay.
Nice to knowyou.

1154
01:18:28,622 --> 01:18:31,216
- I will leave.
- No!

1155
01:18:31,324 --> 01:18:34,760
No.
Don't-- Don't leave.

1156
01:18:34,861 --> 01:18:36,886
Don't leave.
No leaving.

1157
01:18:40,467 --> 01:18:44,267
It'sjust,
I'm not gonna be ready--

1158
01:18:44,371 --> 01:18:48,432
I mean, the partywon't be
ready until Saturday.

1159
01:18:50,043 --> 01:18:52,477
I can stay here until then?

1160
01:18:52,579 --> 01:18:54,137
Yeah.

1161
01:18:55,348 --> 01:18:57,475
I'm gonna be right back.
Is that okay?

1162
01:18:57,584 --> 01:19:00,144
- Okay.
- Nadia.

1163
01:19:00,253 --> 01:19:03,745
Who's in my room.
Now. Holy shit.

1164
01:19:05,125 --> 01:19:07,116
Allright, I'vegotaplan.

1165
01:19:07,227 --> 01:19:09,787
Okay.
How about I come backwith you...

1166
01:19:09,896 --> 01:19:11,488
and you say...

1167
01:19:11,598 --> 01:19:13,828
"Hello, this is Michelle,
my girlfriend."

1168
01:19:13,933 --> 01:19:17,460
And obviously, Nadia won't
expectyou to hop in the sack.

1169
01:19:17,570 --> 01:19:21,131
And then we break up
the day ofthe party.

1170
01:19:21,241 --> 01:19:23,266
And you're all healed
and back on the market.

1171
01:19:24,711 --> 01:19:27,236
- You're evil.
- No way!

1172
01:19:27,347 --> 01:19:29,440
I'm like Cupid.

1173
01:19:29,549 --> 01:19:32,040
And I know how
to make a girl jealous.

1174
01:19:32,152 --> 01:19:33,915
This is gonna be fun.

1175
01:19:34,020 --> 01:19:35,988
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you sooner...

1176
01:19:36,089 --> 01:19:38,489
but wejust started seeing
each other a few weeks ago.

1177
01:19:41,461 --> 01:19:44,726
But I'd really love it
ifyou stayed here.

1178
01:19:44,831 --> 01:19:47,629
I thinkyou should stay
and have fun at the party.

1179
01:19:47,734 --> 01:19:51,295
Good for you,Jim.
Ofcourse I will stay.

1180
01:19:51,404 --> 01:19:54,339
That's great--
That's my nipples!

1181
01:19:54,441 --> 01:19:57,205
Shejust loves my nipples.

1182
01:21:29,869 --> 01:21:31,538
- Oh, my God.
- You still broken?

1183
01:21:31,538 --> 01:21:32,630
- Oh, my God.
- You still broken?

1184
01:21:34,808 --> 01:21:36,799
I'm fine.

1185
01:21:36,910 --> 01:21:40,141
I might have to
actually go through with this.

1186
01:21:43,249 --> 01:21:45,979
What's the big deal
with Nadia, anyway?

1187
01:21:46,085 --> 01:21:49,987
I mean, okay, so she's
50,000 times hotter...

1188
01:21:50,089 --> 01:21:51,989
than most girls, but...

1189
01:21:52,091 --> 01:21:54,184
come on, it'sjust sex.

1190
01:21:56,296 --> 01:21:58,560
You saw the thing on the Internet.

1191
01:21:58,665 --> 01:22:00,895
Did it look like I might have had...

1192
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,628
a slight interest in Nadia then?

1193
01:22:05,405 --> 01:22:07,305
Add anotheryear to that.

1194
01:22:07,407 --> 01:22:09,568
Okay.

1195
01:22:09,676 --> 01:22:15,080
Hey, why don'tyou bring Nadia to
the concert first? It'll be a cool date.

1196
01:22:16,115 --> 01:22:18,015
We'll see how things go.

1197
01:22:23,122 --> 01:22:26,922
Michelle, you have been great.

1198
01:22:27,026 --> 01:22:28,687
Thankyou.

1199
01:22:28,795 --> 01:22:30,387
Anytime.

1200
01:22:37,537 --> 01:22:39,266
Come on.

1201
01:22:42,375 --> 01:22:44,570
You ready to break up?

1202
01:22:44,677 --> 01:22:46,975
You big, stupid dummy!

1203
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:49,344
Theater is so cool!

1204
01:22:49,449 --> 01:22:52,782
I don't care ifyou are the best lay
I've ever had in my life.

1205
01:22:52,886 --> 01:22:56,014
- I hateyour guts anyway.
- Don't say that.

1206
01:22:56,122 --> 01:23:01,185
And I don't care ifyou did give me
ten orgasms in a row...

1207
01:23:01,294 --> 01:23:03,228
becauseyou smell really bad.

1208
01:23:05,899 --> 01:23:07,628
I smell really bad!

1209
01:23:07,734 --> 01:23:11,226
Because we've been having
so much sex, and--

1210
01:23:11,337 --> 01:23:14,829
and I haven't showered,
and I wanna shower!

1211
01:23:16,442 --> 01:23:20,344
So, don'tyou go being all
super sexy guy anymore...

1212
01:23:20,446 --> 01:23:22,846
because I am now impervious...

1213
01:23:22,949 --> 01:23:26,680
toyour unrelenting machismo
and sexual ardor.

1214
01:23:27,620 --> 01:23:30,851
And that includes fucking me
in the ass! So there!

1215
01:23:38,598 --> 01:23:40,623
We had something special.

1216
01:24:17,136 --> 01:24:19,536
- What's up?
- What's up, dog?

1217
01:24:22,508 --> 01:24:24,408
Vicki. Hey.

1218
01:24:24,510 --> 01:24:27,877
I'm so glad you came.
You want something to drink or--

1219
01:24:27,981 --> 01:24:29,778
Can I helpyou?

1220
01:24:31,217 --> 01:24:32,445
- Kevin.
- What?

1221
01:24:32,552 --> 01:24:33,917
That's my date.

1222
01:24:49,569 --> 01:24:51,764
You-- You saved them all.

1223
01:24:51,871 --> 01:24:53,498
How sweet.

1224
01:24:54,607 --> 01:24:56,507
You don't think I'm a dork?

1225
01:24:59,379 --> 01:25:03,748
Whateveryou are,Jim,
it is what I like.

1226
01:25:05,618 --> 01:25:07,609
Kevin left.
Didn't look good.

1227
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:09,745
Kevin left?

1228
01:25:10,656 --> 01:25:12,425
Just wandered down the beach.

1229
01:25:16,529 --> 01:25:18,394
You okay, Kev?

1230
01:25:21,701 --> 01:25:23,532
Wanna tell us what's up?

1231
01:25:25,271 --> 01:25:27,432
Wanna feel Finch's ass?

1232
01:25:31,044 --> 01:25:34,445
No, I--
I went to say hi to Vicky...

1233
01:25:34,547 --> 01:25:37,311
and she was there with a date.

1234
01:25:37,417 --> 01:25:39,942
You hooked up with three girls
this year. You're doing fine.

1235
01:25:40,053 --> 01:25:41,987
Rule ofthree, Oz.

1236
01:25:48,127 --> 01:25:50,925
I guess I was living in the past--
wanting to partywith you guys...

1237
01:25:51,030 --> 01:25:53,521
and be with Vicky,
just like high school.

1238
01:25:53,633 --> 01:25:56,124
You remember
that day after prom?

1239
01:25:56,235 --> 01:25:58,965
You know, we made
a toast to the next step.

1240
01:26:00,306 --> 01:26:02,900
I guess I never took it.

1241
01:26:05,144 --> 01:26:08,511
My brother said that by the end
ofthe summer I'd see the big picture.

1242
01:26:08,614 --> 01:26:10,582
And I see it.

1243
01:26:10,683 --> 01:26:14,278
No matterwhat, times change
and things are different.

1244
01:26:14,387 --> 01:26:17,845
The problem is,
I don't want them to be.

1245
01:26:17,957 --> 01:26:20,016
You know, Kevin,
I haven't moved on either.

1246
01:26:20,126 --> 01:26:24,495
I've been obsessed with the one woman
I can't have a real future with...

1247
01:26:24,597 --> 01:26:28,590
other than a very kinky,
extremelywarped one.

1248
01:26:30,069 --> 01:26:32,333
I got to find a new goddess.

1249
01:26:33,873 --> 01:26:37,240
It's gonna take patience,
but I've been celibate all summer.

1250
01:26:37,343 --> 01:26:41,404
- You kinda get used to it, though, huh?
- Areyou insane?

1251
01:26:44,217 --> 01:26:48,381
Look, Kev, different does not
necessarily mean worse.

1252
01:26:48,488 --> 01:26:51,355
As a matter offact,
I think things arejust getting better.

1253
01:26:51,524 --> 01:26:54,618
Or am I gonna have to drag your ass
back to that party and prove it toyou?

1254
01:26:55,895 --> 01:26:57,089
I'll walk.

1255
01:27:12,345 --> 01:27:13,573
Wow.

1256
01:27:14,380 --> 01:27:17,474
You know,
you have beautiful eyes.

1257
01:27:17,583 --> 01:27:21,644
- Oh, you're sweet.
- That's a really nice top.

1258
01:27:21,754 --> 01:27:25,155
- Oh. Thanks.
- You're welcome.

1259
01:27:25,258 --> 01:27:28,489
- Wanna fuck?
- Areyou serious?

1260
01:27:28,594 --> 01:27:31,722
Come on, baby.
Give it to the Stifmeister.

1261
01:27:31,831 --> 01:27:34,698
- I thinkyou better--
- Your loss.

1262
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:37,860
Wow. You know,
you have beautiful eyes.

1263
01:27:37,970 --> 01:27:41,497
Come here, dude. Come on.
You're making an ass out ofyourself.

1264
01:27:41,607 --> 01:27:45,008
You're ruining my mojo.
And you're not the Stifmeister, okay?

1265
01:27:45,111 --> 01:27:47,477
It takes years to develop
true Stifmeister style.

1266
01:27:47,580 --> 01:27:50,879
Come on, man!
I just wanna see some boobs.

1267
01:27:50,983 --> 01:27:52,746
- Hey, Pop Tart.
- Dream on, midget.

1268
01:27:52,852 --> 01:27:56,288
Excuse him. Come here.
Take this. You're on cop watch.

1269
01:27:56,389 --> 01:27:59,256
Go out in the driveway.
See any cops, call me, okay?

1270
01:27:59,358 --> 01:28:01,087
All right.

1271
01:28:11,204 --> 01:28:15,163
Gentlemen,
this appears to be a party.

1272
01:28:18,110 --> 01:28:21,568
Guys, ifyou'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go look for Nadia.

1273
01:28:21,681 --> 01:28:23,444
Good luck.

1274
01:28:26,452 --> 01:28:29,080
So what was this year like for you?

1275
01:28:29,188 --> 01:28:31,383
Did you miss high school?

1276
01:28:31,490 --> 01:28:33,481
Well, no.

1277
01:28:33,593 --> 01:28:37,222
When you travel as much as I do,
you get used to moving on.

1278
01:28:38,598 --> 01:28:40,998
But I have great memories.

1279
01:28:44,570 --> 01:28:47,596
- Wow, can we go in there?
- The lighthouse?

1280
01:28:52,778 --> 01:28:54,507
Yes, we can.

1281
01:28:54,614 --> 01:28:56,479
How romantic.

1282
01:28:59,118 --> 01:29:00,415
Jim, come on.

1283
01:29:17,403 --> 01:29:20,600
Oh, it's beautiful!

1284
01:29:20,706 --> 01:29:22,367
Cool!

1285
01:29:25,011 --> 01:29:29,380
Jim, I have told you
my memories from high school.

1286
01:29:29,482 --> 01:29:31,211
What areyours?

1287
01:29:36,922 --> 01:29:38,014
You.

1288
01:29:38,124 --> 01:29:40,354
You have not changed.

1289
01:29:45,031 --> 01:29:48,091
Jim, relax.

1290
01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:52,534
We arejust, how doyou say,
tooting our horns.

1291
01:29:53,706 --> 01:29:55,640
Actually,
that is quite difficult.

1292
01:29:55,741 --> 01:29:56,935
What doyou mean?

1293
01:29:57,843 --> 01:30:01,074
Well, this one time
at band camp--

1294
01:30:06,519 --> 01:30:08,612
Holy shit.

1295
01:30:09,922 --> 01:30:12,049
What? Tell me.

1296
01:30:13,459 --> 01:30:16,895
Well, this one time at band camp...

1297
01:30:18,130 --> 01:30:20,189
I got stuck playing this trombone.

1298
01:30:20,299 --> 01:30:23,427
And I can't play anything at all.
So I totally sucked.

1299
01:30:23,536 --> 01:30:25,470
And everyone thought
I was this Petey guy...

1300
01:30:25,571 --> 01:30:28,506
but I didn't know what to think,
so I just kept playing and playing...

1301
01:30:28,607 --> 01:30:30,234
and I didn't know what I was doing.

1302
01:30:30,343 --> 01:30:32,243
It was so funny!

1303
01:30:33,779 --> 01:30:36,839
- I gotta go.
- What? Why?

1304
01:30:39,752 --> 01:30:41,652
Please don't take this
the wrong way...

1305
01:30:41,754 --> 01:30:44,188
but, butyou're--

1306
01:30:44,290 --> 01:30:47,350
you're everything
that I used to want.

1307
01:30:47,460 --> 01:30:50,520
And as much as I may really...

1308
01:30:50,629 --> 01:30:54,326
really regret
what I'm about to do...

1309
01:30:55,835 --> 01:30:57,700
there's somebody else
I want to be with.

1310
01:30:57,803 --> 01:31:01,068
You want the band geek?

1311
01:31:01,173 --> 01:31:05,041
Nadia, I am a band geek.

1312
01:31:06,545 --> 01:31:09,309
I just neverjoined the band.

1313
01:31:14,086 --> 01:31:15,986
You go getyour geek.

1314
01:31:17,656 --> 01:31:19,453
Someday I will find mine.

1315
01:31:38,344 --> 01:31:41,643
Hey, Kevin Meyers.

1316
01:31:41,747 --> 01:31:43,908
Hi.
Sorry I was a dick before.

1317
01:31:44,016 --> 01:31:46,849
It's okay, man.
My name's Brett.

1318
01:31:46,952 --> 01:31:49,750
- Could you give us a sec?
- Sure.

1319
01:31:51,190 --> 01:31:53,351
Look, you don't have to do this.

1320
01:31:53,459 --> 01:31:55,950
Maybe I was being selfish...

1321
01:31:56,061 --> 01:31:59,428
in wanting to beyour friend.

1322
01:31:59,532 --> 01:32:02,194
Maybe it'sjust not gonna work.

1323
01:32:02,301 --> 01:32:05,828
I would much rather haveyou as a friend
than not haveyou in my life at all.

1324
01:32:19,251 --> 01:32:21,151
Party on!

1325
01:32:26,759 --> 01:32:30,286
- From the lighthouse all the way--
- Hey, handsome.

1326
01:32:37,369 --> 01:32:38,927
What areyou doing here?

1327
01:32:39,038 --> 01:32:41,404
I was gonna pickyou up
at the airport in two hours.

1328
01:32:41,507 --> 01:32:43,771
I took an earlier flight,
and I thought I'd surpriseyou.

1329
01:32:43,876 --> 01:32:47,744
- Yeah, you did.
- Kinda weird without the phone, huh?

1330
01:32:47,847 --> 01:32:50,077
We'll get used to it.

1331
01:32:50,182 --> 01:32:53,481
Come on. I wanna hear all about it.
Gonna grabyou a drink.

1332
01:32:54,420 --> 01:32:57,116
Steve, this cop-watch
thing is horseshit.

1333
01:32:57,223 --> 01:32:58,656
Hello?

1334
01:33:00,493 --> 01:33:02,984
Man, this sucks.

1335
01:33:03,095 --> 01:33:04,926
Whoisitout there?

1336
01:33:08,133 --> 01:33:10,761
It's the Stifmeister, baby.

1337
01:33:10,870 --> 01:33:12,701
Is thatso?

1338
01:33:17,142 --> 01:33:19,474
Life's a bitch, isn't it?

1339
01:33:21,747 --> 01:33:25,046
It's all right.
You don't have to say anything.

1340
01:33:25,150 --> 01:33:27,550
I'm used to girls ignoring me.

1341
01:33:27,653 --> 01:33:29,553
Or making fun ofme.

1342
01:33:29,655 --> 01:33:31,680
"Come on, Sherman.
Be the Sherminator."

1343
01:33:33,392 --> 01:33:36,418
Like the movie.
How clever.

1344
01:33:36,529 --> 01:33:38,463
I get it, okay?

1345
01:33:40,232 --> 01:33:41,665
Maybe I am a geek.

1346
01:33:41,767 --> 01:33:44,258
Whatever.

1347
01:33:46,472 --> 01:33:49,441
Yes! Yes, you are!

1348
01:33:51,977 --> 01:33:53,535
All right.

1349
01:33:55,748 --> 01:33:59,445
I am the Sherminator.

1350
01:33:59,552 --> 01:34:03,010
A sophisticated sex robot
sent back through time...

1351
01:34:03,122 --> 01:34:05,613
to change the future
for one lucky lady.

1352
01:34:06,625 --> 01:34:08,616
I am lucky lady?

1353
01:34:08,727 --> 01:34:13,460
That's right, Nadia.
You've been targeted for Shermination.

1354
01:34:13,566 --> 01:34:16,194
Come with me
ifyou want to live.

1355
01:34:19,805 --> 01:34:20,472
Help!

1356
01:34:20,472 --> 01:34:21,063
Help!

1357
01:34:24,977 --> 01:34:27,343
- Fuck me, geek!
- Affirmative!

1358
01:34:27,446 --> 01:34:29,880
No fuckin' way!

1359
01:34:36,121 --> 01:34:39,284
- Forget it.
- Likeyou have a chance.

1360
01:34:54,640 --> 01:34:56,369
Cheers, bud.

1361
01:35:02,114 --> 01:35:05,049
Hey, Steve, lookwhat I found.

1362
01:35:05,150 --> 01:35:07,618
- Dude, don't touch the shirt.
-Just look.

1363
01:35:10,656 --> 01:35:11,953
- Hi.
- Hey, there.

1364
01:35:12,057 --> 01:35:14,860
Brilliant.
You found lesbians.

1365
01:35:16,362 --> 01:35:18,887
Good luck trying to break
through that force field.

1366
01:35:18,998 --> 01:35:22,297
- Lesbians?
- We never said that.

1367
01:35:28,374 --> 01:35:30,934
- What?
- We never said that.

1368
01:35:34,580 --> 01:35:36,275
Oh, man.

1369
01:35:37,383 --> 01:35:41,251
I will do anything-- anything--
to sleep with you chicks.

1370
01:35:41,353 --> 01:35:45,790
Okay? I'll grab
every guy's ass in this room.

1371
01:35:45,891 --> 01:35:49,054
I'll caress it, even.
I'll shave some ass ifthey need it.

1372
01:35:49,161 --> 01:35:51,391
Oh, yeah.
You heard me.

1373
01:35:51,497 --> 01:35:56,491
It's true. I'll kiss everybody here.
Dudes, chicks, everybody.

1374
01:35:56,602 --> 01:36:00,368
Because I am comfortable
with my sexuality.

1375
01:36:00,472 --> 01:36:01,769
Oh, yeah.

1376
01:36:03,842 --> 01:36:06,310
At least have a drink
with the Stifmeister.

1377
01:36:07,780 --> 01:36:09,680
- All right.
- That's fair.

1378
01:36:11,517 --> 01:36:13,075
All right.

1379
01:36:15,688 --> 01:36:17,986
You truly are a Stifmeister.

1380
01:36:18,090 --> 01:36:22,186
- Welcome back to the party.
- Steve, those are my lesbians.

1381
01:36:22,294 --> 01:36:25,127
- Ladies, I am down with the funky shit.
- Like what?

1382
01:36:25,230 --> 01:36:27,528
One time at this party,
I was drinking champagne--

1383
01:36:30,703 --> 01:36:32,330
Thankyou. Thankyou.

1384
01:36:32,438 --> 01:36:35,771
Our next soloist
will be Michelle Flaherty.

1385
01:37:04,670 --> 01:37:06,501
Petey?

1386
01:37:10,943 --> 01:37:13,138
This kid is killing me.

1387
01:37:15,581 --> 01:37:17,483
- You suck, retard.
- I'm not retarded.

1388
01:37:17,483 --> 01:37:18,882
- You suck, retard.
- I'm not retarded.

1389
01:37:18,984 --> 01:37:21,043
I'm a very special boy.

1390
01:37:37,603 --> 01:37:39,594
How's this
for a band camp story?

1391
01:37:50,916 --> 01:37:54,545
Come on, guys.
Let's hear it for Petey!

1392
01:38:23,816 --> 01:38:25,977
That untalented bastard!

1393
01:39:06,825 --> 01:39:08,986
- Good for them.
- It's awesome.

1394
01:39:12,564 --> 01:39:15,124
- Wanna dance?
- Yeah.

1395
01:39:15,234 --> 01:39:18,067
We'll be back.
Come on now, baby.

1396
01:40:02,381 --> 01:40:04,650
You know, there's only one word
for that party.

1397
01:40:04,650 --> 01:40:05,514
You know, there's only one word
for that party.

1398
01:40:05,617 --> 01:40:07,812
- Bitchin'.
- Out ofcontrol.

1399
01:40:09,521 --> 01:40:11,490
Am I gonna have a hangover?
'Cause I want one.

1400
01:40:11,490 --> 01:40:11,717
Am I gonna have a hangover?
'Cause I want one.

1401
01:40:19,298 --> 01:40:20,458

This partywas crazy!
Look at my date! He's passed out!

1405
01:40:29,408 --> 01:40:31,808

- He couldn't hack it.

1406
01:41:10,882 --> 01:41:14,181
- Best summer ever, huh, fellas?
- Absolutely.

1407

So, are we gonna

I called a couple ofweeks ago.

1416
01:41:54,292 --> 01:41:56,760
Didn't Steven tell you that
I was gonna drop by sometime?

1417
01:41:56,862 --> 01:41:59,592
I guess it slipped his mind.

1418
01:42:01,400 --> 01:42:03,061
What's your name?

I've been thinking, and,
you know, I'm 1 9 years old.

1422
01:42:15,147 --> 01:42:19,277
There's a whole world out there.
I can't be obsessed with one woman.

1423
01:42:19,384 --> 01:42:23,150
-Just can't be.
- I'm glad you're learning, Finchy.

What a dumb ass.
