00:00:54,434 --> 00:00:57,979
Hey, Stifler, how come Steve
got all the talent in your family?

4
00:00:58,104 --> 00:01:01,608
Bite me, Fuck Face.
Come on, man, you're missing it.

5
00:01:01,816 --> 00:01:05,111
I've seen it a million times,
you fucking ass-booger.

6
00:01:05,194 --> 00:01:09,032
Steve is like a filmmaking genius.
A true American hero.

7
00:01:09,115 --> 00:01:10,658
The Tarantino of titties.

8
00:01:10,742 --> 00:01:13,119
Yeah, there's just no way
you could ever be this good.

9
00:01:13,202 --> 00:01:14,746
Hey, look, I'm going to prove to Steve...

10
00:01:14,829 --> 00:01:17,999
that I'm up to the standards
of the Stiffmeister Productions.

11
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:20,752
After Steve sees my directing talent...

12
00:01:20,835 --> 00:01:24,297
- little bro's joining the family business.
- Is that what he said?

13
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:28,551
- He finally called you back?
- No, but I left him another message.

14
00:01:30,178 --> 00:01:33,473
He'll get back to me.
It's only been three weeks.

15
00:01:34,682 --> 00:01:39,896
Gentle-fucks, a toast.
Tomorrow, we begin our reign as seniors.

16
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:44,210
Okay, people, let's take a break.

17
00:02:44,586 --> 00:02:48,923
<i>Remember, we play this at the end of
the ceremony after Pomp and Circumstance. </i>

18
00:02:49,007 --> 00:02:51,259
I don't want anyone starting
the wrong song again.

19
00:02:51,342 --> 00:02:54,304
- Elyse, you need to relax, girl.
- I'm fine.

20
00:02:54,637 --> 00:02:57,557
I just... You know,
it's my first time up here, and...

21
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,351
Yeah, but it's graduation.
It ain't the Boston Pops.

22
00:03:00,435 --> 00:03:03,646
This performance sets the tone
for our senior year. I mean...

23
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:08,443
Look, you just remember
that everybody here is pulling for you.

24
00:03:12,488 --> 00:03:15,116
Dork. Dork. Dork. Goose.

25
00:03:16,075 --> 00:03:19,704
- I like them feisty.
- What're you doing here, Stifler?

26
00:03:19,787 --> 00:03:22,415
<i>We just want to say sayonara,
and let you fuck-necks know...</i>

27
00:03:22,498 --> 00:03:27,420
we plan on winning the state title, now that
the Stiffmeister's running the show.

28
00:03:27,503 --> 00:03:31,507
<i>- Adios, butt-hugger.
- He's a bigger asshole than his brother.</i>

29
00:03:35,094 --> 00:03:36,930
Holy shit, Arrianna.

30
00:03:37,805 --> 00:03:40,058
Matt, what're you doing here?

31
00:03:40,183 --> 00:03:44,437
Oh, we just want to make sure
the seniors have a very memorable last day.

32
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,482
That's cool. So, there's a campout tonight...

33
00:03:47,565 --> 00:03:50,652
and it's only for the grads,
but you could come.

34
00:03:50,735 --> 00:03:53,404
Let me check my schedule. Hell, yeah.

35
00:03:54,697 --> 00:03:58,534
Bring your sleeping bag,
in case we decide to pitch a tent.

36
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:07,377
Check it out. Perfect timing.
This is going to be classic.

37
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:11,339
Time to initiate
Operation Gradu-fuck-uation.

38
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:15,969
This is gonna be awesome.

39
00:04:16,052 --> 00:04:17,887
- Shit.
- Oh, yeah! Jackpot!

40
00:04:18,221 --> 00:04:22,100
Payback, seniors.
Don't get that pepper spray on your hands.

41
00:04:25,144 --> 00:04:28,064
A graduation gift from the Stiffmeister.

42
00:04:31,609 --> 00:04:34,153
Dude, we should've sprayed
the diplomas.

43
00:04:36,489 --> 00:04:38,032
Sorry, bandees.

44
00:04:43,204 --> 00:04:46,958
Bite my nuts and call me Skippy.
It's a Steely Dan.

45
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:50,461
- A what?
- It's a double-headed dildo.

46
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:52,672
It's a dildo. It's a dildo.

47
00:04:53,298 --> 00:04:55,550
- Holy shit.
- It's even got a name.

48
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,303
Picardo?

49
00:04:58,678 --> 00:05:01,806
- Spray that shit.
- Fuck, no. Finders keepers.

50
00:05:02,056 --> 00:05:05,476
<i>Okay, everybody, Pomp and
Circumstance.  Five-minute warning. Let's go.</i>

51
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,895
The bandees. Let's get out of here.

52
00:05:12,025 --> 00:05:14,068
- Matt?
- Leesy.

53
00:05:15,612 --> 00:05:18,573
How they hanging?
Still small and perky, I see.

54
00:05:18,656 --> 00:05:21,075
- That's funny.
- Yeah.

55
00:05:22,118 --> 00:05:26,122
- What're you doing here, Matt?
- I just came by to wish you good luck.

56
00:05:26,205 --> 00:05:28,750
- You know, on the whole music thing.
- Good luck?

57
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:31,628
You haven't said a word to me
since the eighth grade.

58
00:05:31,711 --> 00:05:34,756
Yeah, and that tone of voice
is exactly the reason why.

59
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:37,216
So, I'm going to take off now.

60
00:05:41,137 --> 00:05:45,475
Ladies and gentlemen,
please rise to honor our graduates.

61
00:05:45,558 --> 00:05:47,226
Douchebag's gonna miss it.

62
00:05:59,989 --> 00:06:01,324
Oh, yes.

63
00:06:04,661 --> 00:06:06,329
Are they crying?

64
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,458
Holy shit!

65
00:06:17,215 --> 00:06:18,424
Yes!

66
00:06:39,904 --> 00:06:41,656
Eat shit, seniors.

67
00:07:01,801 --> 00:07:02,844
Uh oh!

68
00:07:03,177 --> 00:07:05,471
Stifler!

69
00:07:08,141 --> 00:07:11,811
I've been waiting for this moment
for a very long time.

70
00:07:13,062 --> 00:07:15,857
And now, the day of reckoning has come.

71
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:20,653
Hello, Matthew.

72
00:07:21,195 --> 00:07:23,573
Your brother must be very proud.

73
00:07:26,242 --> 00:07:28,494
You've continued his legacy.

74
00:07:29,495 --> 00:07:31,664
Tormenting the innocent...

75
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:35,376
defiling all that is good and pure.

76
00:07:38,796 --> 00:07:41,507
But now, you're going down.

77
00:07:42,592 --> 00:07:45,803
What're you going to do,
expel me, Shermanator?

78
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:50,141
I am a sophisticated counseling machine...

79
00:07:50,224 --> 00:07:53,978
sent back in time
to guide young and innocent minds.

80
00:07:54,354 --> 00:07:59,359
My primary directive is to protect
the students of this institution...

81
00:08:00,234 --> 00:08:03,112
and all, indeed all mankind...

82
00:08:03,863 --> 00:08:06,783
from the menace that is another Stifler.

83
00:08:06,991 --> 00:08:09,577
Behavior modification is required.

84
00:08:09,911 --> 00:08:12,747
It's not too late to change your future.

85
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,462
No, expulsion would be too easy.

86
00:08:22,674 --> 00:08:25,927
I know the perfect punishment
to fit your crime.

87
00:08:28,429 --> 00:08:31,557
Since you have so much trouble
with the band...

88
00:08:31,724 --> 00:08:34,435
perhaps you should make friends with them.

89
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:36,187
No fucking way.

90
00:08:38,022 --> 00:08:42,652
Either you learn to be more considerate
or you will be expelled.

91
00:08:43,486 --> 00:08:44,988
No football.

92
00:08:45,947 --> 00:08:47,156
No parties.

93
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,075
No spring break.

94
00:08:49,826 --> 00:08:52,412
No graduation.

95
00:08:52,745 --> 00:08:54,372
No college.

96
00:08:54,455 --> 00:08:56,165
No coeds.

97
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:58,459
<i>Comprende?</i>

98
00:09:03,172 --> 00:09:05,216
Pack your bags, Stifler.

99
00:09:05,758 --> 00:09:08,553
- You're going to Band Camp.
- Band Camp!

100
00:09:15,268 --> 00:09:17,604
Bullshit, trash.

101
00:09:22,275 --> 00:09:23,776
<i>All right, Steve! Valley Girls Gone Wild. </i>

102
00:09:25,486 --> 00:09:26,571
Fuck.

103
00:09:45,298 --> 00:09:46,591
Told you Steve'd get back to me.

104
00:09:46,674 --> 00:09:48,051
I mean, it was just a postcard...

105
00:09:48,134 --> 00:09:50,345
but it gave me a great idea.

106
00:09:50,428 --> 00:09:51,554
Look...

107
00:09:51,638 --> 00:09:53,765
Steve's shit-head friend, Jim...

108
00:09:53,848 --> 00:09:56,309
he married
this freaking nympho band-geek, Michelle.

109
00:09:56,392 --> 00:09:59,312
And he said
all they do at Band Camp is screw 24/7.

110
00:09:59,395 --> 00:10:03,524
Matt, buddy, you cannot screw band chicks.
There are standards.

111
00:10:04,901 --> 00:10:08,321
I'm not talking about screwing them,
scrotum-breath.

112
00:10:08,446 --> 00:10:10,990
I'm talking about videotaping them.

113
00:10:11,074 --> 00:10:14,619
People love to see dorks doing
that freaky shit on hidden video.

<i>Bandeez Gone Wild.

Hell, yeah.

Color night vision? I'll take it. Shit.

You're hairy, and you smell like shit.

00:14:03,181 --> 00:14:05,642
<i>- I have no idea.
- The Nutcracker. </i>

158
00:14:08,061 --> 00:14:09,145
Step back, bitch.

159
00:14:09,228 --> 00:14:11,606
Holy mother of Mozart.

160
00:14:13,524 --> 00:14:14,651
This is bad.

161
00:14:14,734 --> 00:14:17,403
You didn't know Jackie Chan
was in the house, did you boys, huh?

162
00:14:17,487 --> 00:14:19,489
Stop that. Stop that now.

163
00:14:19,572 --> 00:14:21,908
Those knob-slobbers started it.

164
00:14:21,991 --> 00:14:24,619
That's not true, sir.
We simply reminded him to wear his beanie.

165
00:14:24,702 --> 00:14:27,080
And then he viciously assaulted
Brandon's genitals.

166
00:14:27,163 --> 00:14:31,626
- That's a lie, you dick-snot.
- Oscar, Jimmy, escort this man to see...

167
00:14:31,876 --> 00:14:34,212
- the Macro.
- The what?

168
00:14:34,671 --> 00:14:36,923
- You're dead.
- Now, gentlemen.

169
00:14:37,757 --> 00:14:39,926
God, Brandon, are you okay?

170
00:14:40,969 --> 00:14:43,513
You want to tell me
what the hell you're doing here, Stifler?

171
00:14:43,596 --> 00:14:46,140
It don't matter, Big O.
He ain't gonna be here long.

172
00:14:46,224 --> 00:14:47,350
- Bitch!
- Get over here.

173
00:14:47,433 --> 00:14:49,644
Macro gonna fuck your ass up, fool.

174
00:14:49,727 --> 00:14:52,313
- What the fuck's a macro?
- The Macro.

175
00:14:52,397 --> 00:14:54,607
Morale And Conflict Resolution Officer.

176
00:14:54,691 --> 00:14:57,068
I heard this one time,
this kid went into that office...

177
00:14:57,151 --> 00:14:58,903
a baritone and came out a soprano.

178
00:14:58,987 --> 00:15:01,948
- Clarinet up the ass backwards, yo.
- What?

179
00:15:09,497 --> 00:15:10,832
Pussies.

180
00:15:24,721 --> 00:15:26,097
Oh, I'm sorry.

181
00:15:28,266 --> 00:15:30,435
<i>Frankenstein.  Scary stuff.</i>

182
00:15:31,686 --> 00:15:34,105
I am just a Boris Karloff nut.

183
00:15:34,397 --> 00:15:38,484
- I'm the Macro, Mr. Levenstein.
- Holy shit, you're Jim's dad.

184
00:15:39,068 --> 00:15:42,030
He screwed that redheaded nympho chick
at my lake house.

185
00:15:42,113 --> 00:15:45,825
- Oh, my, you're not a Stifler?
- Yeah, I'm Steve's brother, Matt.

186
00:15:47,243 --> 00:15:50,872
- There are two Stiflers?
- Yes, sir. Hey, what're you doing here?

187
00:15:50,955 --> 00:15:54,959
Oh, well, Jim is now out of the house,
married to Michelle...

188
00:15:55,043 --> 00:15:58,212
that redheaded nympho chick
that you spoke of.

189
00:15:59,464 --> 00:16:02,425
And, being a former
Tall Oaks Counselor of the Year...

190
00:16:02,508 --> 00:16:07,639
she was hired to be the Macro this summer,
but she got pregnant.

191
00:16:07,972 --> 00:16:11,434
No doubt due to the tendencies
you alluded to earlier.

192
00:16:11,517 --> 00:16:14,562
And I have a great rapport with
young people...

193
00:16:14,646 --> 00:16:17,065
so I just stepped in and volunteered.

194
00:16:17,148 --> 00:16:20,693
That cretin is not in our band,
and we are not responsible for his actions.

195
00:16:20,777 --> 00:16:23,529
- Who pissed in your piccolo?
- I'm sensing some hostility here.

196
00:16:23,613 --> 00:16:24,948
- He poisoned my band.
- What?

197
00:16:25,031 --> 00:16:28,034
- I'm the Macro and it's my job to deal with...
- What is he doing here?

198
00:16:28,117 --> 00:16:31,537
- Matt Stifler is pure evil just like his brother.
... conflict.

199
00:16:31,621 --> 00:16:33,122
Thanks, Leesy.

200
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:39,504
She seems nice.

201
00:16:40,463 --> 00:16:41,923
There are rules, of course.

202
00:16:42,006 --> 00:16:43,716
- You will have to wear a beanie.
- Yeah.

203
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,220
Oh, I know. It's a little silly,
but it's tradition here...

204
00:16:47,303 --> 00:16:50,932
something you're familiar with,
being on the football team, I'm sure...

205
00:16:51,015 --> 00:16:54,560
with your elephant walks and circle jerks
and drinking butt beer.

206
00:16:54,644 --> 00:16:56,980
But here, you just have to wear
a silly little hat and...

207
00:16:57,063 --> 00:16:59,607
- a somewhat stylish Tall Oaks T-shirt.
- Yeah.

208
00:17:00,233 --> 00:17:02,277
So, just go with the flow, Matt...

209
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,779
and you will have loads of fun...

210
00:17:05,154 --> 00:17:08,199
and you'll be making new friends in no time.

211
00:17:15,206 --> 00:17:18,084
Hey, Ernie Kaplowitz, tenor sax.

212
00:17:19,377 --> 00:17:22,005
Cool! I'm a rookie here, too.

213
00:17:22,255 --> 00:17:26,175
I really wanted to come last year,
but Computer Camp conflicted, and...

214
00:17:26,342 --> 00:17:30,471
Oh, yeah, that was here when I arrived.
I think it has your name on it.

215
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:34,017
What is it?

216
00:17:35,768 --> 00:17:39,439
<i>Hi, welcome to Casa de Stifler.
I'll be your host, Matt.</i>

217
00:17:39,606 --> 00:17:43,151
Every day here, I'll make it my sincere goal
not to have to kick your ass.

218
00:17:43,234 --> 00:17:46,070
Allow me to show you
to your new accommodations.

219
00:17:47,113 --> 00:17:49,741
When I'm out here, you're in there.

220
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,994
Have a great day, fucko.

221
00:17:53,286 --> 00:17:54,495
I don't...

222
00:17:57,915 --> 00:17:59,083
Okay...

223
00:17:59,167 --> 00:18:00,835
I'll just go and put this stuff away for you.

224
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:02,170
All right. Bandee-vision.

225
00:18:04,964 --> 00:18:09,218
This is a 1978 Ohio State show...

226
00:18:09,302 --> 00:18:10,678
<i>The Wizard Of Oz. </i>

227
00:18:10,762 --> 00:18:14,515
The one where the sousaphone player
forgot to dot the I? Oh, hey.

228
00:18:16,517 --> 00:18:19,228
Yeah, right. Freaks.

229
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,691
Never fear, the Stiffmeister's here.

230
00:18:23,775 --> 00:18:26,945
Band Camp just got
a whole lot better, ladies.

231
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:29,656
You're Steve Stifler's younger brother,
aren't you?

232
00:18:29,739 --> 00:18:31,574
- Young and hung.
- Great.

233
00:18:31,699 --> 00:18:35,036
<i>- Could you send him a message for me?
- No problem, senorita. </i>

234
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:46,631
Well, it looks like Steve gave someone
the old Stifler bang-and-boot.

235
00:18:47,715 --> 00:18:51,010
- Is there a problem here?
- No, everything's fine.

236
00:18:53,054 --> 00:18:56,307
- Have fun at Band Camp.
- Thank you, I will.

237
00:19:00,311 --> 00:19:02,647
- Later.
- Word.

238
00:19:03,147 --> 00:19:05,942
You need to start showing some respect
around here, Stifler.

239
00:19:06,025 --> 00:19:09,445
You need to show yourself
back to your table, Big Dog.

240
00:19:09,529 --> 00:19:11,364
Out of my way, Yo.

241
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:16,786
<i>Hola, chicas.
Elyse, so good to see you again.</i>

242
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,248
So, what's going on tonight?
We gonna party, get a little crazy?

243
00:19:20,331 --> 00:19:22,917
Who wants to rack up
a few frequent fucker miles?

244
00:19:23,001 --> 00:19:26,087
- You know, you are the most...
- Most sexy man ever to come to Band Camp.

245
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:30,216
- What? Chloe, he is so obnoxious.
- Sexy obnoxious.

246
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,386
- Thank you.
- I'm tired of messing around with these...

247
00:19:33,469 --> 00:19:35,388
dorky-ass nice guys...

248
00:19:35,513 --> 00:19:37,765
and sensitive-artist types.

249
00:19:38,141 --> 00:19:42,687
<i>- Let's party with a real hombre tonight.
- Hell, yeah. That's me:</i>

250
00:19:43,229 --> 00:19:47,233
<i>- 100% hombre.
- All right, my room, 8:00.</i>

251
00:19:48,401 --> 00:19:52,071
<i>Great first day, campers.
This is your Macro speaking... </i>

252
00:19:52,155 --> 00:19:55,700
<i>and, hey, morale
couldn't have been higher today. </i>

253
00:19:55,783 --> 00:19:58,536
<i>So hop in the sack,
and get a good night's sleep because... </i>

254
00:19:59,954 --> 00:20:02,874
<i>starting tomorrow, we have
many, many exciting activities planned... </i>

255
00:20:02,957 --> 00:20:06,711
<i>not the least of which is
the race for the Tall Oaks Cup. </i>

256
00:20:06,878 --> 00:20:08,922
<i>So let the games begin. </i>

257
00:20:09,213 --> 00:20:13,176
<i>Bandeez Gone Wild.
Scene One. Party hombre. </i>

258
00:20:18,056 --> 00:20:22,393
It's called Strip Trivia. We made it up.
It's a Band Camp tradition.

259
00:20:22,727 --> 00:20:27,023
"Fourth and Long," "Sextuplets,"
"Banging Babes," and "Who Blew Me?"

260
00:20:27,148 --> 00:20:30,318
This looks like my kind of game.
Shall we play?

261
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:34,322
You sit in the middle.
Your game, my seating chart.

262
00:20:34,447 --> 00:20:35,990
Sit a little closer, ladies.

263
00:20:36,074 --> 00:20:38,409
<i>Don't be scared. It's all right. </i>

264
00:20:38,493 --> 00:20:39,661
<i>Okay... </i>

265
00:20:39,953 --> 00:20:42,956
<i>the rules are simple.
You choose a category and a question... </i>

266
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:45,500
and every time you miss, you strip.

267
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:46,668
Hell, yeah.

268
00:20:46,751 --> 00:20:50,421
- I'll go first. "Who Blew Me?"
- Good.

269
00:20:53,716 --> 00:20:58,179
I am a silver Stradivarius trumpet
played by a Pulitzer Prize winner.

270
00:20:59,222 --> 00:21:00,556
Who blew me?

271
00:21:00,723 --> 00:21:03,226
- Yeah, like I'd know.
- Sorry.

272
00:21:03,434 --> 00:21:04,894
Lose the shoes, and pick again.

273
00:21:04,978 --> 00:21:06,938
You didn't tell me this shit was about music.

274
00:21:07,021 --> 00:21:10,650
- Well, it is Band Camp, moron.
- Hey, to be fair...

275
00:21:10,942 --> 00:21:13,987
maybe we should just give him a head start.

276
00:21:17,532 --> 00:21:19,242
All right. Yeah.

277
00:21:20,451 --> 00:21:22,203
<i>Okay, all right. All right. </i>

278
00:21:23,788 --> 00:21:26,708
What's wrong with you?
Scared to show off the mosquito bites?

279
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:29,544
I've matured since the fourth grade, Matt.
Have you?

280
00:21:29,627 --> 00:21:32,672
Oh, I've got 10 pounds of dangling maturity
right here, Leesy.

281
00:21:32,755 --> 00:21:35,717
- Quit calling me that.
- Okay, okay, moving on.

282
00:21:36,426 --> 00:21:40,680
- Matt, just pick another question, please.
- All right, screw it. Whatever.

283
00:21:41,306 --> 00:21:43,516
There you go. Suck on that.

284
00:21:45,101 --> 00:21:47,812
- Fourth and Long.
- Sure, no problem.

285
00:21:51,107 --> 00:21:55,612
Of Beethoven's major symphonies,
which has the longest fourth movement?

286
00:21:56,529 --> 00:21:58,406
All right, I see where this is going.

287
00:21:58,489 --> 00:22:01,200
Fine, you win.

288
00:22:05,663 --> 00:22:06,914
I free ball, ladies.

289
00:22:07,582 --> 00:22:11,794
Got to let the big boys breathe.
All right, we play by my rules now.

290
00:22:12,253 --> 00:22:15,173
Football questions only.
Prepare to strip, ladies.

291
00:22:15,924 --> 00:22:19,552
<i>- Wait. But first, does anybody want a beer?
- I do. </i>

292
00:22:20,011 --> 00:22:24,974
The counselors have a secret stash
in the fridge across the hall.

293
00:22:25,141 --> 00:22:29,020
- Would you mind?
- Now we're talking about a fucking party.

294
00:22:29,103 --> 00:22:30,897
Stiffy'll be back in a jiffy.

295
00:22:33,191 --> 00:22:35,777
I mean, there's nobody around...

296
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:38,279
and we haven't seen your best side yet.

297
00:22:44,911 --> 00:22:47,121
Yes! We got him.

298
00:22:49,207 --> 00:22:51,042
So busted.

299
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,344
Man, big boys, wake up.

300
00:23:01,427 --> 00:23:03,930
Just gotta turn down the A.C. In there, huh?

301
00:23:04,013 --> 00:23:05,181
Good night, girls.

302
00:23:12,563 --> 00:23:15,191
Sorry, asshole, game's over.

303
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,821
Yeah, the big boys
will love the long walk home.

304
00:23:20,697 --> 00:23:22,490
Room check, girls.

305
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:25,076
Oh, shit.

306
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:27,662
- Ditch his clothes.
- Out the window.

307
00:23:28,413 --> 00:23:30,873
All right, who wants a long neck?

308
00:23:37,755 --> 00:23:39,507
Nurse Sanders.

309
00:23:42,302 --> 00:23:44,804
- They set me up.
- He attacked us with pepper spray...

310
00:23:44,887 --> 00:23:47,599
- and ruined our graduation.
- I went there for a friendly game...

311
00:23:47,682 --> 00:23:48,766
Hold it. Hold it. Kids.

312
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:50,893
Okay...

313
00:23:51,144 --> 00:23:52,895
where are your clothes?

314
00:23:55,565 --> 00:23:57,025
I have them.

315
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:59,652
- May I ask why?
- Well, they got me naked...

316
00:23:59,736 --> 00:24:02,989
- Oh, whatever. He took his own pants off...
- And they stole my clothes.

317
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:05,825
And I got stuck up there
with Mrs. Doubtfire checking out my...

318
00:24:11,998 --> 00:24:13,958
Let me see if I have this straight.

319
00:24:14,125 --> 00:24:18,796
Elyse, you think Matt is an arrogant jock
who wears his penis on his forehead...

320
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,300
just to gain the approval of
his sociopathic brother.

321
00:24:22,383 --> 00:24:26,304
And Matt, you think Elyse
is an uptight, geeky prude...

322
00:24:26,387 --> 00:24:29,140
who needs to loosen up and get laid.

323
00:24:29,223 --> 00:24:32,435
Excuse the expression, dear.
Is that close to being on the money?

324
00:24:34,187 --> 00:24:35,355
Look, kids...

325
00:24:36,814 --> 00:24:39,400
the only way to solve your differences...

326
00:24:40,068 --> 00:24:41,736
is by working together.

327
00:24:42,904 --> 00:24:44,697
So why don't you start tomorrow...

328
00:24:45,114 --> 00:24:48,201
by putting one foot in front of the other?

329
00:24:51,871 --> 00:24:53,665
Left flank hut.

330
00:24:56,125 --> 00:24:57,627
Turn and hut.

331
00:25:05,301 --> 00:25:06,552
What the fuck!

332
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,931
Band 10 hut!

333
00:25:10,181 --> 00:25:11,224
Holy shit.

334
00:25:11,766 --> 00:25:15,311
When I yell "band 10 hut,"
you snap firmly at attention.

335
00:25:15,395 --> 00:25:19,107
- You want to see me firmly at attention?
- I already have. I wasn't impressed.

336
00:25:22,026 --> 00:25:23,236
Look...

337
00:25:24,112 --> 00:25:26,072
we've never beaten Beechwood, okay?

338
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:28,908
For some of us, it's our last shot.

339
00:25:31,703 --> 00:25:33,288
Just stop screwing up, okay?

340
00:25:33,371 --> 00:25:34,789
Yeah, asshole.

341
00:25:37,375 --> 00:25:39,627
Okay, people, back to work, let's go.
Whatever.

342
00:25:39,711 --> 00:25:41,087
I don't need this shit.

343
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:43,631
Reset the block. Front ranks, right here.

344
00:25:57,604 --> 00:25:58,938
Housekeeping.

345
00:26:26,382 --> 00:26:28,801
Oscar, brought me something to drink?

346
00:26:29,093 --> 00:26:32,096
- Come on.
- Good looking out, baby.

347
00:26:34,682 --> 00:26:36,434
Hey, it's Ernie Crapowitz.

348
00:26:36,517 --> 00:26:39,646
So you finally came out of the closet.
Good for you.

349
00:26:41,022 --> 00:26:43,566
Look, I want to know
what goes on at night, all right?

350
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:46,277
All the crazy shit.
Naked pillow fights, whatever.

351
00:26:46,361 --> 00:26:49,864
Do I look like the guy that's in charge of
the naked pillow fights, huh?

352
00:26:49,948 --> 00:26:51,491
It's my first time here.

353
00:26:51,574 --> 00:26:52,784
Notice the beanie?

354
00:26:52,867 --> 00:26:53,993
Yes.

355
00:26:54,953 --> 00:26:56,412
Yes, I do.

356
00:26:56,496 --> 00:26:59,874
Yes, speaking of beanies,
where's yours, Stifler?

357
00:27:00,208 --> 00:27:02,168
You still not following the rules, huh?

358
00:27:02,252 --> 00:27:04,170
- Let's see.
- Look. He's getting in trouble again.

359
00:27:04,254 --> 00:27:07,674
No standard-issue Tall Oaks T-shirt
and no beanie.

360
00:27:07,757 --> 00:27:11,094
I believe that's two points from Great Falls,
Mr. Nelson.

361
00:27:11,344 --> 00:27:13,221
Tell you what, Vande-cramp...

362
00:27:13,554 --> 00:27:16,349
what if I took his beanie...

363
00:27:16,432 --> 00:27:19,185
and put it on my weenie?

364
00:27:19,269 --> 00:27:23,356
How do you like that Vande-cramp?
It's on my head, right?

365
00:27:23,523 --> 00:27:25,775
Make it five points from Great Falls.

366
00:27:25,942 --> 00:27:27,235
Five points.

367
00:27:27,318 --> 00:27:30,488
Man, this place sucks donkey ass.

368
00:27:35,576 --> 00:27:37,328
Put your beanie on, Son.

369
00:27:43,167 --> 00:27:45,128
Five points.

370
00:28:08,484 --> 00:28:10,778
Stay still. Stop moving.

371
00:28:10,862 --> 00:28:12,614
He ain't going nowhere now.

372
00:28:12,697 --> 00:28:16,034
This isn't your world. This is our
world, and we don't want you in it.

373
00:28:16,117 --> 00:28:18,369
You already cost us
five points in the standings.

374
00:28:18,453 --> 00:28:20,246
We can't have that.

375
00:28:20,496 --> 00:28:22,206
Set the man up with his beanie.

376
00:28:29,964 --> 00:28:31,883
Now you're representing, fool.

377
00:28:31,966 --> 00:28:33,259
And this toothpaste...

378
00:28:33,343 --> 00:28:36,054
this will make up
for the pepper spray, asshole.

379
00:28:49,943 --> 00:28:51,486
Oh, shit.

380
00:28:52,195 --> 00:28:54,614
I'll get the paint thinner
from maintenance.

381
00:28:56,199 --> 00:28:57,575
Animals.

382
00:29:08,044 --> 00:29:12,173
Matt, you were sent here...

383
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:14,050
to make a change.

384
00:29:14,217 --> 00:29:17,971
And, so far, you've only had
your sinuses sanitized. So...

385
00:29:18,346 --> 00:29:20,765
I think it's time to try a new approach.

386
00:29:21,224 --> 00:29:23,017
Make some friends.

387
00:29:24,769 --> 00:29:26,604
Earn their trust.

388
00:29:28,856 --> 00:29:31,150
Why would I want to earn their trust?

389
00:29:34,404 --> 00:29:35,947
Good.

390
00:29:40,076 --> 00:29:42,161
Welcome to Stifler-vision.

391
00:29:42,245 --> 00:29:44,747
<i>I think there's
a cymbal class at 1:00.</i>

392
00:29:44,914 --> 00:29:46,124
<i>I hate that. </i>

393
00:29:46,207 --> 00:29:48,418
<i>Yeah, but it's better than
the bass drum relay. </i>

394
00:29:48,501 --> 00:29:49,752
<i>Yeah, that's true. </i>

395
00:29:54,299 --> 00:29:56,509
<i>Yours look totally fantastic. </i>

396
00:29:56,593 --> 00:29:59,846
<i>Two for the price of one.
My left one's bigger, see?</i>

397
00:29:59,929 --> 00:30:02,849
<i>Yeah, mine, too, baby.
They can totally fix that. </i>

398
00:30:02,932 --> 00:30:04,684
<i>No!
Want to see?</i>

399
00:30:04,767 --> 00:30:07,353
<i>I used to be...
Lens fog. No!</i>

400
00:30:18,656 --> 00:30:22,535
What is that thing, butt weasel?
Yeah, it's the KR3, baby.

401
00:30:22,619 --> 00:30:26,289
The Kaplowitz Remote Robotic Rover.
And you are so busted.

402
00:30:26,372 --> 00:30:29,959
- Hey, Oscar, somebody call the Macro.
- Dude, please, shut up.

403
00:30:30,043 --> 00:30:33,796
Pull your panties out of your ass.
I can help you with that chick.

404
00:30:37,592 --> 00:30:38,676
What chick?

405
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,262
Dude, the one with all the tattoos.
The Tubanator.

406
00:30:41,346 --> 00:30:42,805
Her name is Chloe.

407
00:30:43,431 --> 00:30:46,809
Come on, man. I can help.
I'm the Stiffmeister.

408
00:30:46,893 --> 00:30:49,687
- Master of love and romance.
- Bullshit.

409
00:30:49,854 --> 00:30:54,317
I nailed three cheerleaders in one week
on spring break. College cheerleaders.

410
00:31:04,827 --> 00:31:07,330
And I know why your camera spritzed out.

411
00:31:10,041 --> 00:31:12,001
Dude, this thing is awesome.

412
00:31:12,585 --> 00:31:15,672
- You ever use this to look up chicks' skirts?
- No.

413
00:31:15,755 --> 00:31:18,132
But I did use it to win
the State Science Fair last year.

414
00:31:18,216 --> 00:31:20,510
And I'm hoping it gets me into MIT next fall.

415
00:31:20,593 --> 00:31:22,637
I really want to work for NASA.

416
00:31:22,845 --> 00:31:25,348
National Anal Sex Association?

417
00:31:25,556 --> 00:31:27,308
No it's Space...

418
00:31:28,101 --> 00:31:32,772
- There's an Anal Sex Association?
- Oh, yeah, but you've got to be a pro.

419
00:31:34,357 --> 00:31:36,526
Wait, there's a Space Association?

420
00:31:38,069 --> 00:31:40,029
You were supposed to use this.

421
00:31:41,322 --> 00:31:45,535
- See, it's got an anti-fog lens. Duh.
- Yeah, good.

422
00:31:46,619 --> 00:31:51,499
- Can the robot record?
- All right, so, what are your intentions?

423
00:31:52,959 --> 00:31:55,461
With the video, I mean. What are you doing?

424
00:31:55,545 --> 00:31:57,088
Oh, it's just for fun.

425
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:00,842
I mean, who doesn't like to look
at hot naked chicks, right?

426
00:32:02,302 --> 00:32:04,887
Keep it between us, and I'll let you watch.

427
00:32:05,179 --> 00:32:08,808
Plus, I'll have you giving Chloe
the pelvic noogie inside a week.

428
00:32:10,059 --> 00:32:12,061
Hey, Stifler. Phone.

429
00:32:12,228 --> 00:32:14,063
<i>We're in Detroit!</i>

430
00:32:14,689 --> 00:32:17,400
Locked into sweet Brazilian rum.

431
00:32:17,483 --> 00:32:20,236
I'm fucking fubar, man!

432
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:24,657
I sent you rum today.
Could come in handy in Dorksville.

433
00:32:24,741 --> 00:32:26,409
This place blows.

434
00:32:27,619 --> 00:32:29,329
Hey, my roommate, Dr. Robot...

435
00:32:29,412 --> 00:32:31,581
<i>busted me taping some college chicks
in the shower. </i>

436
00:32:31,664 --> 00:32:33,791
So now I have to be all nice to him and shit.

437
00:32:33,875 --> 00:32:37,253
And I'm not getting any good footage
'cause these fucking bandees hate me.

438
00:32:38,963 --> 00:32:41,174
Think of it
like trying to hook up with a virgin.

439
00:32:41,257 --> 00:32:44,844
<i>Act like you give a shit about them
until they bring you into the good stuff. </i>

440
00:32:44,928 --> 00:32:46,804
Earn their trust?

441
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:49,390
Dude, that could work.

442
00:32:49,515 --> 00:32:52,060
I'll be an undercover bandee fucker.

443
00:32:52,977 --> 00:32:56,481
Hello, everyone.
Isn't it a peachy day here at Band Camp?

444
00:32:56,689 --> 00:33:00,568
Band buds. How's it going? Yo.

445
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:05,281
Hey, I just want to say thanks
for the little wakeup call. You kidders.

446
00:33:06,407 --> 00:33:09,494
Hey, I can finally hear
the music calling me, okay?

447
00:33:10,745 --> 00:33:13,581
There. Hear it? Yeah. Me, too.

448
00:33:13,831 --> 00:33:18,503
So I'm a totally new man, and... By the way,
you both look great in pantyhose.

449
00:33:28,888 --> 00:33:32,183
- What are you doing?
- Awaiting my marching lesson, ma'am.

450
00:33:32,267 --> 00:33:34,727
Look, Matt, I really don't have time for this
right now.

451
00:33:34,811 --> 00:33:38,356
No, look, I figure I'm here,
I might as well make the best of it.

452
00:33:38,439 --> 00:33:41,859
Matt, marching's hard, okay?
It's not like throwing some football.

453
00:33:41,943 --> 00:33:45,613
- Oh, you ever thrown into double coverage?
- You ever high-stepped in double time?

454
00:33:45,697 --> 00:33:49,200
Yes, ma'am, the time the cops chased us
across Koreno's Creek.

455
00:33:49,826 --> 00:33:52,704
And you got so scared, you cried.

456
00:33:53,454 --> 00:33:57,542
- I had allergies.
- It was winter, Mattie.

457
00:33:58,543 --> 00:34:02,005
Well, if you don't teach me to march,
I might just cry again.

458
00:34:05,592 --> 00:34:06,759
Fine.

459
00:34:07,051 --> 00:34:11,097
Left foot on one and three,
right foot on two and four.

460
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,724
You have to do math?

461
00:34:21,316 --> 00:34:25,236
One, two, three, middle.
One, two, three, line.

462
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,530
Right foot on four.

463
00:34:29,782 --> 00:34:32,327
- Keep your step size even.
- My what?

464
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:37,415
<i>All right, there we go, little buddy.
I'm gonna fix you up good. </i>

465
00:34:38,875 --> 00:34:43,713
<i>Any girl that knows how to play a tuba,
she can do things. That's what Stifler says. </i>

466
00:34:43,796 --> 00:34:46,424
<i>I don't know what it means,
but it's got to be good. </i>

467
00:34:46,507 --> 00:34:47,759
<i>You're good to go. </i>

468
00:34:47,842 --> 00:34:49,385
Let's go find Chloe.

469
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:03,399
Holy shit.

470
00:35:04,651 --> 00:35:07,946
What the hell? Who's doing this?

471
00:35:10,281 --> 00:35:11,407
Take it.

472
00:35:11,491 --> 00:35:12,575
<i>It's okay. </i>

473
00:35:22,252 --> 00:35:25,880
<i>- Thanks, little creepy machine.
- You're welcome...</i>

474
00:35:26,256 --> 00:35:27,966
<i>beautiful lady. </i>

475
00:35:43,273 --> 00:35:47,568
With my right, with my right,
but I can also do it with my left, with my left.

476
00:35:51,072 --> 00:35:52,156
Bootie.

477
00:35:53,574 --> 00:35:54,701
Good game.

478
00:36:00,915 --> 00:36:02,750
You just touched my bootie.

479
00:36:09,799 --> 00:36:12,218
- What's that?
- Your instrument.

480
00:36:12,677 --> 00:36:14,470
That's fucking gay.

481
00:36:15,513 --> 00:36:17,640
- I mean lame.
- Good.

482
00:36:18,433 --> 00:36:21,311
Now, there are two positions.

483
00:36:21,936 --> 00:36:26,107
Carrying position, like this,
and playing position, like this.

484
00:36:26,274 --> 00:36:27,984
Now when I call, "horns up"...

485
00:36:28,067 --> 00:36:30,153
you're gonna move your instrument out,
and then...

486
00:36:30,236 --> 00:36:31,904
Hello, losers.

487
00:36:32,071 --> 00:36:35,867
Matt. Oh, my God. Matt, I am so sorry.

488
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:38,202
- I think I bit a hole in my tongue.
- Oh, let me see.

489
00:36:38,286 --> 00:36:40,830
No, no hole.
On today's...

490
00:36:40,913 --> 00:36:44,250
episode wasting time on lost causes.

491
00:36:44,959 --> 00:36:49,088
Speaking of which, I understand you
composed the music to your show, Elyse...

492
00:36:49,172 --> 00:36:50,798
if you call that music.

493
00:36:50,882 --> 00:36:53,343
Yeah. That's right. I did.

494
00:36:53,426 --> 00:36:55,637
And who'd your daddy hire
to compose yours?

495
00:36:55,720 --> 00:37:00,683
I'm just giving you fair warning, cupcake.
Robards Scholarship is mine.

496
00:37:01,184 --> 00:37:02,602
Like you need it.

497
00:37:02,894 --> 00:37:05,897
It's not a matter of need.
It's a matter of want.

498
00:37:06,189 --> 00:37:09,609
- Yeah, I get what I want.
- Why don't you shut the fuck up?

499
00:37:09,692 --> 00:37:10,944
Matt, don't.

500
00:37:11,986 --> 00:37:14,781
- What are you going to do?
- Kick your ass.

501
00:37:14,948 --> 00:37:16,741
- Are you challenging me?
- No.

502
00:37:16,824 --> 00:37:20,203
- Yeah, what if I am?
- No, Brandon, that is not what he's doing.

503
00:37:20,286 --> 00:37:23,122
I accept. Amphitheatre, 5:00.

504
00:37:23,498 --> 00:37:26,376
It's been three years
since I've been challenged.

505
00:37:26,626 --> 00:37:28,503
We got a challenge.

506
00:37:31,214 --> 00:37:33,633
I look forward to reminding people why.

507
00:37:34,425 --> 00:37:35,927
East Great Falls.

508
00:37:36,219 --> 00:37:38,346
I'll see you there, asshole.

509
00:37:40,223 --> 00:37:44,060
- Do you know what you just did?
- Doesn't matter. He's going down.

510
00:37:44,143 --> 00:37:46,813
Matt, you challenged him to a duel.

511
00:37:47,105 --> 00:37:48,314
With swords?

512
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:52,777
No, you idiot.
You each get on stage and perform.

513
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,904
And the crowd decides who wins.

514
00:37:55,405 --> 00:37:57,323
Can't we just do keg stands?

515
00:37:57,907 --> 00:38:02,328
Matt, this is serious, okay?
Beechwood gets five points if he wins...

516
00:38:02,412 --> 00:38:05,707
which, you know, he will
because he plays an instrument.

517
00:38:05,915 --> 00:38:07,709
Well, so do I.

518
00:38:08,251 --> 00:38:11,045
<i>Let the Tall Oaks
Battle Royale begin. </i>

519
00:38:11,629 --> 00:38:14,507
<i>The prize is five points towards the cup. </i>

520
00:38:15,425 --> 00:38:17,427
Okay, Brandon, you're up first.

521
00:39:01,387 --> 00:39:02,680
Come on!

522
00:39:05,016 --> 00:39:07,560
Suck on that, bitch.

523
00:39:08,603 --> 00:39:09,896
Lame.

524
00:39:10,647 --> 00:39:12,231
This is so embarrassing.

525
00:39:12,315 --> 00:39:13,566
<i>Okay, Brandon. </i>

526
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:15,276
Now you show him, Brandon.

527
00:39:33,211 --> 00:39:34,420
Take that!

528
00:39:46,057 --> 00:39:48,851
<i>Well, seems this contest is over. </i>

529
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:51,896
Figures. We just lost five points.

530
00:39:54,524 --> 00:39:57,527
<i>And the winner by forfeit is... </i>

531
00:40:00,029 --> 00:40:01,698
But I know it's not his fault...

532
00:40:24,929 --> 00:40:26,681
You don't know the words.

533
00:40:48,453 --> 00:40:50,038
He should shave that.

534
00:40:52,874 --> 00:40:54,542
East Great Falls!

535
00:40:55,126 --> 00:40:56,961
East Great Falls!

536
00:40:57,253 --> 00:40:59,172
East Great Falls!

537
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:01,466
East Great Falls!

538
00:41:04,636 --> 00:41:07,221
<i>Okay, five points to Great Falls. </i>

539
00:41:09,098 --> 00:41:11,100
All right, Great Falls!

540
00:41:13,478 --> 00:41:15,647
East Great Falls!

541
00:41:18,149 --> 00:41:19,025
East Great Falls!

542
00:41:20,068 --> 00:41:22,195
East Great Falls!

543
00:41:22,278 --> 00:41:24,280
East Great Falls!

544
00:41:25,865 --> 00:41:27,575
Hey, hey...

545
00:41:27,659 --> 00:41:29,744
- Hey.
- What?

546
00:41:29,827 --> 00:41:32,413
- Are you really Scottish?
- Fuck, no.

547
00:41:33,414 --> 00:41:34,791
My mum made me learn an instrument.

548
00:41:34,874 --> 00:41:36,751
That's the most annoying one
I could think of.

549
00:41:36,834 --> 00:41:40,630
I think you were just born
to squeeze sacks and blow pipes, Stifler.

550
00:41:40,838 --> 00:41:42,173
Hey, Oscar.

551
00:41:46,886 --> 00:41:49,555
How many other Oscars
do you know? Go!

552
00:41:51,933 --> 00:41:54,352
- What's up?
- Your drum line sounds pretty tight.

553
00:41:54,435 --> 00:41:55,520
Oh, thanks.

554
00:41:55,603 --> 00:41:57,647
You let me know
if you want to learn some new moves.

555
00:41:57,855 --> 00:41:58,982
Really?

556
00:41:59,065 --> 00:42:01,776
- He's gonna screw it up.
- He's definitely gonna screw it up.

557
00:42:03,319 --> 00:42:07,573
- Thanks for winning those points back.
- I lost them. I had to get them back.

558
00:42:08,408 --> 00:42:11,494
Hey, guys,
Sheree's gonna show me some moves.

559
00:42:12,036 --> 00:42:13,121
<i>Hey, gang... </i>

560
00:42:13,204 --> 00:42:17,584
just a little reminder that as the battle
for the cup heats up, let's try to remember...

561
00:42:18,793 --> 00:42:22,338
<i>to keep up that Tall Oaks spirit of fair play
and friendly competition. </i>

562
00:42:23,131 --> 00:42:25,508
We'll have enough spit for a six-pack.

563
00:42:28,761 --> 00:42:31,723
- Yeah, baby, you did me proud, son.
- Thanks, J. Lo.

564
00:42:31,806 --> 00:42:33,266
It's cool. Big O?

565
00:42:33,641 --> 00:42:36,644
Quite a little show you put on
yesterday, Stifler.

566
00:42:36,811 --> 00:42:39,647
You know,
these plebes think you're some kind of hero.

567
00:42:39,731 --> 00:42:41,983
I don't know what a plebe is, Vande-creep.

568
00:42:42,066 --> 00:42:45,278
Didn't anybody tell you not to mess
with the big dog while he's eating?

569
00:42:45,361 --> 00:42:48,114
It's mine, jerk-wad.
Now will you give it back?

570
00:42:49,574 --> 00:42:52,827
- Dildos.
- This is still my camp, asshole.

571
00:42:53,077 --> 00:42:55,622
- You're going down.
- No, I'm not.

572
00:42:55,705 --> 00:42:56,831
But your mum did last night.

573
00:42:56,914 --> 00:43:00,251
Did she play the trumpet?
Because she has really strong lips.

574
00:43:00,501 --> 00:43:01,794
That's right.

575
00:43:17,477 --> 00:43:18,645
Yummy.

576
00:43:22,398 --> 00:43:24,400
That's what I'm talking about.

577
00:43:25,568 --> 00:43:28,529
- What happened this time, Claire?
- Well, I was working on my solo...

578
00:43:28,613 --> 00:43:30,073
and I hurt myself.

579
00:43:30,949 --> 00:43:32,784
I've been fucking poisoned.

580
00:43:34,077 --> 00:43:36,788
Ipecac is a natural herbal extract...

581
00:43:36,871 --> 00:43:39,916
that triggers the regurgitation reflex.

582
00:43:44,254 --> 00:43:46,965
Whatever's in there
should be out soon enough.

583
00:43:47,257 --> 00:43:49,008
Like him, if we're lucky.

584
00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:54,639
Well, I'm pretty sure
it's probably just something...

585
00:43:54,973 --> 00:43:59,352
you had for lunch, you know? I've got
the same problem. Very sensitive stomach.

586
00:43:59,978 --> 00:44:03,398
I was at a banquet once.
On the same plate, if you can believe it...

587
00:44:03,481 --> 00:44:08,695
they had creamed venison, squid fritters,
and jellied pork.

588
00:44:14,325 --> 00:44:15,451
What?

589
00:44:26,671 --> 00:44:29,382
- Hey, what's up, crust bucket?
- Come here, dude. Check this out.

590
00:44:29,465 --> 00:44:33,136
So, this afternoon, while the counselors
were practicing for the talent show...

591
00:44:33,219 --> 00:44:35,805
I faked an asthma attack,
and I changed both of the cameras.

592
00:44:35,888 --> 00:44:38,558
<i>It's their talent show routine, au naturel. </i>

593
00:44:38,933 --> 00:44:41,644
Dude, you filthy little cyberfucker. Shit.

594
00:44:42,478 --> 00:44:46,983
- Hey, I thought we were just going to watch.
- Exactly, we may want to watch it again.

595
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:57,160
Hey, so, I took your advice about Chloe.
I used the Rover to deliver a soda.

596
00:44:57,744 --> 00:45:01,581
- That was your cool, crazy idea?
- Yeah, I think she actually liked it.

597
00:45:01,664 --> 00:45:04,709
- Yeah, that sounds gay.
- It's not gay.

598
00:45:06,252 --> 00:45:09,130
Anyway, there's
this bonfire-slushee party tonight...

599
00:45:09,213 --> 00:45:12,467
and I really need to know Step Two
in the Stiffmeister plan.

600
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:16,137
Slushee party. Really.

601
00:45:16,471 --> 00:45:18,056
Special delivery.

602
00:45:18,181 --> 00:45:19,933
Prepare to jam with the bearded clam.

603
00:45:21,184 --> 00:45:22,769
Get ready to cuddle the love puddle.

604
00:45:22,852 --> 00:45:26,189
The time has come for Dr. Robot to get laid.

605
00:45:26,397 --> 00:45:27,482
Get laid?

606
00:45:27,649 --> 00:45:30,318
I told you, trust the Stiffmeister.

607
00:45:30,568 --> 00:45:33,321
<i>Meister means "master" in German.</i>

608
00:45:34,238 --> 00:45:38,576
Get her drunk? That's the secret
of the ages? That's Step Number Two?

609
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:43,623
No, actually, it's Step Four. You don't have
the balls for Two or the tongue for Three.

610
00:45:43,790 --> 00:45:45,291
I've got the balls.

611
00:45:45,833 --> 00:45:48,378
Hey, you haven't heard Step Five yet.

612
00:45:52,173 --> 00:45:55,843
<i>Born to be wild</i>

613
00:45:59,514 --> 00:46:03,184
<i>Well, I'm hot blooded
Check it and see</i>

614
00:46:03,559 --> 00:46:07,355
<i>I've got a fever of 103</i>

615
00:46:07,438 --> 00:46:10,233
<i>Come on baby
Do you do more than dance?</i>

616
00:46:12,026 --> 00:46:14,821
- This is some good shit.
- Don't enjoy it too much.

617
00:46:14,904 --> 00:46:18,366
- We have a big practice tomorrow, you guys.
- Relax, Leesy.

618
00:46:18,783 --> 00:46:21,995
Suckle the tender fruits
of Band Camp with your friends.

619
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:25,915
Come on, Elyse. Cut loose a little bit.
Have some fun.

620
00:46:25,999 --> 00:46:27,333
I am having fun.

621
00:46:27,417 --> 00:46:30,420
Hey, horn dog, let's go get
some more of these before they run out.

622
00:46:30,503 --> 00:46:32,922
- All right.
- Horn dog?

623
00:46:33,006 --> 00:46:37,552
Yeah, it's his nickname. Dude will stick
his dick into anything. It's unnatural.

624
00:46:38,553 --> 00:46:42,432
Check it, dawg. This one time
at Band Camp, I fucked an oboe.

625
00:46:43,474 --> 00:46:45,852
- Really?
- Blow in it for a while...

626
00:46:45,935 --> 00:46:50,565
get that wood nice and warm,
slap on some valve oil and go to town, yo.

627
00:46:50,773 --> 00:46:52,942
Hey, maybe you should try a flute.

628
00:46:57,572 --> 00:47:00,074
Now's a good time
to teach you those moves.

629
00:47:00,158 --> 00:47:01,200
Really?

630
00:47:06,831 --> 00:47:07,999
What?

631
00:47:22,472 --> 00:47:23,848
I know what you're doing.

632
00:47:23,932 --> 00:47:28,061
- You do?
- It's what you always do. You're a fake.

633
00:47:28,311 --> 00:47:31,439
You do whatever it takes
to be the centre of attention.

634
00:47:31,522 --> 00:47:35,401
Just like when we were kids,
around me, you were regular old Matt...

635
00:47:35,735 --> 00:47:39,113
but around Steve and his friends,
you were the Stiffmeister.

636
00:47:40,239 --> 00:47:41,908
Who're you going to be tonight?

637
00:47:41,991 --> 00:47:43,618
Hey, cheese dick...

638
00:47:43,701 --> 00:47:48,164
why don't you quit being such a fucking
taint licker, and get me another slushee.

639
00:47:48,247 --> 00:47:50,208
Fucking puss monkey.

640
00:47:58,049 --> 00:48:00,635
You know what?
I am going to have some fun.

641
00:48:08,643 --> 00:48:11,771
Fucking hoes, man. I don't get that shit.

642
00:48:11,854 --> 00:48:15,775
I mean, right now, Oscar's off in the woods
tapping that counselor biatch, Sheree.

643
00:48:15,858 --> 00:48:18,653
- What's up with that?
- That cock spring is getting laid?

644
00:48:18,736 --> 00:48:21,739
True that. And here we are,
the two dopest homeboys in camp...

645
00:48:21,823 --> 00:48:26,119
and we ain't got no prospects
for our palm pilots. That's fucked up, dawg.

646
00:48:26,494 --> 00:48:28,538
Dude, I gotta see this.

647
00:48:32,166 --> 00:48:34,085
Use your hips more.
Hips, like that?

648
00:48:34,168 --> 00:48:38,089
Yeah, now faster. Yeah. Like that.
A circle. Like that.

649
00:48:38,172 --> 00:48:42,343
Crikey! The
alpha female has chosen an unlikely mate.

650
00:48:42,427 --> 00:48:45,054
Will he survive this dangerous encounter...

651
00:48:45,305 --> 00:48:49,726
or will she satisfy her primal needs
and then devour him for dinner?

652
00:48:50,018 --> 00:48:51,644
Stay tuned.

653
00:48:52,061 --> 00:48:55,940
I'm sorry. I'm really no good
at this stuff.

654
00:48:56,024 --> 00:48:58,109
Relax. You're doing fine.

655
00:49:01,487 --> 00:49:02,989
This sucks.

656
00:49:03,323 --> 00:49:05,867
How's that feel? Oscar.

657
00:49:06,451 --> 00:49:08,620
Is that your drumstick poking me?

658
00:49:09,787 --> 00:49:11,748
I don't have my drumsticks.

659
00:49:11,831 --> 00:49:14,626
Are you standing up for me again, Oscar?

660
00:49:15,168 --> 00:49:16,878
It's getting hot.

661
00:49:17,170 --> 00:49:20,089
Smack my ass and call me cowboy.

662
00:49:20,882 --> 00:49:23,092
Hello, Double-D Sheree.

663
00:49:23,551 --> 00:49:25,303
<i>Hips. Hips. </i>

664
00:49:25,553 --> 00:49:27,221
- Use your hips.
- Oh, yeah, hips.

665
00:49:27,305 --> 00:49:29,140
And step, and...

666
00:49:32,352 --> 00:49:33,478
Who knew?

667
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:35,897
Wow.

668
00:49:38,858 --> 00:49:41,277
<i>Yo, we at Tall Oaks
Sipping on juice</i>

669
00:49:41,361 --> 00:49:43,655
<i>Got horns, trumpets
Rhythm and flutes</i>

670
00:49:43,738 --> 00:49:46,074
<i>Great Falls laying it down</i>

671
00:49:46,157 --> 00:49:48,701
<i>Gonna ride fucking Beechwood
out of the town</i>

672
00:49:48,785 --> 00:49:51,162
<i>J.C., what, rocking the bunch</i>

673
00:49:51,245 --> 00:49:54,332
<i>All tripped out on the fucking fruit punch</i>

674
00:49:57,752 --> 00:50:01,130
<i>- I just want to be respectful.
- Oh, that's sweet. </i>

675
00:50:01,381 --> 00:50:03,925
The only person who's gonna get laid
around here.

676
00:50:13,101 --> 00:50:15,144
Hello, oboe.

677
00:50:32,036 --> 00:50:33,788
This is so cool.

678
00:50:35,331 --> 00:50:39,669
I hope I didn't scare you
with the Rover and the soda.

679
00:50:39,794 --> 00:50:41,963
No, man, it was cute.

680
00:50:42,672 --> 00:50:46,259
Nobody's ever been that sweet to me
in my whole life.

681
00:50:46,843 --> 00:50:48,428
Plus, to be honest...

682
00:50:48,845 --> 00:50:51,973
metal really turns me on.

683
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:20,919
Man, the shit's stuck.

684
00:51:45,443 --> 00:51:47,904
- Turn off the lights.
- Damn, gangsta.

685
00:51:48,029 --> 00:51:50,698
- I was just fucking with you, dawg!
- You... It's stuck.

686
00:51:50,782 --> 00:51:53,201
- Shit, you want help?
- Don't touch me.

687
00:51:54,744 --> 00:51:55,828
Come on.

688
00:51:56,579 --> 00:51:58,164
Maybe you should blow on it.

689
00:51:58,247 --> 00:51:59,958
Maybe you should blow on it
and I'll pull.

690
00:52:00,041 --> 00:52:02,210
Hell, no. Jimmy ain't putting his lips
on that thing.

691
00:52:02,293 --> 00:52:03,753
Jimmy should be a team player.

692
00:52:03,836 --> 00:52:06,089
Try and relax, dawg.
Not so hard.

693
00:52:06,172 --> 00:52:07,757
Oh, my God!

694
00:52:14,722 --> 00:52:18,226
- I was just trying to help him get it off, yo.
- Dude, shut up.

695
00:52:18,309 --> 00:52:19,435
Whatever.

696
00:52:19,519 --> 00:52:21,562
He had an allergic reaction to the valve oil.

697
00:52:21,646 --> 00:52:24,315
The swelling should go down
in a few minutes.

698
00:52:24,565 --> 00:52:28,695
These kinds of things would never happen
with our old Macro.

699
00:52:49,716 --> 00:52:52,552
We didn't have MTV when I was growing up.

700
00:52:53,886 --> 00:52:56,472
So maybe it's the over-stimulated times...

701
00:52:56,556 --> 00:53:00,685
that we live in
that causes young men to stick their...

702
00:53:01,394 --> 00:53:04,272
instruments in such odd places.

703
00:53:06,190 --> 00:53:07,775
I knew a certain young man once...

704
00:53:07,859 --> 00:53:11,154
who actually engaged in sexual congress
with an apple pie.

705
00:53:11,321 --> 00:53:13,197
And he turned out just fine.

706
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:16,659
So, you're perfectly normal...

707
00:53:17,785 --> 00:53:19,370
as these things go.

708
00:53:37,722 --> 00:53:40,850
- Are you okay?
- Oh, yeah.

709
00:53:40,934 --> 00:53:45,438
I'm so drunk right now.
I'm probably going to forget about you...

710
00:53:46,898 --> 00:53:48,983
porking an oboe.

711
00:53:58,076 --> 00:53:59,827
I have six piercings.

712
00:54:01,287 --> 00:54:03,831
That doesn't include the ones on my face.

713
00:54:17,345 --> 00:54:18,763
Two right here...

714
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:24,185
and four down here.

715
00:54:35,905 --> 00:54:37,865
Haven't seen that in a while.

716
00:54:38,241 --> 00:54:43,288
Yeah, well, no time for dance.
It's all about band, band, band.

717
00:54:43,371 --> 00:54:45,373
No, I was talking about you having fun.

718
00:54:45,456 --> 00:54:49,002
- I have fun. I have fun all the time.
- Yeah.

719
00:54:49,085 --> 00:54:51,796
I just get stressed out, you know. I mean...

720
00:54:52,463 --> 00:54:54,674
we graduate next year, and I don't know.

721
00:54:54,757 --> 00:54:56,801
I mean, I don't really talk about it
all that much...

722
00:54:56,884 --> 00:54:59,846
because the cup is, like,
a team thing, and...

723
00:54:59,929 --> 00:55:03,057
But winning the Robards Scholarship,
I mean, that is like...

724
00:55:03,141 --> 00:55:04,851
my future, you know? And...

725
00:55:05,810 --> 00:55:08,646
Dr. Choi is coming. I mean...

726
00:55:08,813 --> 00:55:12,275
you don't understand. She's like famous...

727
00:55:12,734 --> 00:55:15,737
like holy-shit famous.
And, sometimes, I just...

728
00:55:16,779 --> 00:55:18,489
I get really stressed out...

729
00:55:18,573 --> 00:55:22,410
and I calm myself down
by going off and playing on my Picardo.

730
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:25,830
Wait, you have... Picardo?

731
00:55:25,997 --> 00:55:28,583
It's just a cheapie, but I lost it.

732
00:55:28,916 --> 00:55:32,128
- Wait, if I somehow found this Picard thing...
- You found it?

733
00:55:32,378 --> 00:55:34,297
- Maybe.
- Give it back.

734
00:55:34,589 --> 00:55:36,132
If you let me watch.

735
00:55:37,091 --> 00:55:40,136
Okay, but it takes me a while to warm up.

736
00:55:40,219 --> 00:55:42,680
I have all the time in the world.

737
00:55:45,266 --> 00:55:46,351
Figures.

738
00:55:48,227 --> 00:55:50,813
But I'm going to have to be really drunk.

739
00:55:51,689 --> 00:55:55,026
I mean really drunk. Really drunk.

740
00:55:55,944 --> 00:55:56,986
Yes.

741
00:55:57,570 --> 00:55:59,072
Beat it, jerk off.

742
00:56:18,174 --> 00:56:20,510
<i>Okay, people, let's take a break. </i>

743
00:56:23,930 --> 00:56:26,057
<i>We're all a little sluggish today. </i>

744
00:56:27,850 --> 00:56:29,477
Man, we suck.

745
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:33,106
Man, one night of fun was not worth
losing a whole day of practice.

746
00:56:36,818 --> 00:56:38,319
Give me this thing.

747
00:56:39,112 --> 00:56:41,698
<i>All right, listen up,
you lazy bunch of lip shits. </i>

748
00:56:41,781 --> 00:56:43,741
<i>Those Beechwood plebes
aren't taking breaks. </i>

749
00:56:43,825 --> 00:56:46,744
<i>We want to win this thing,
we've gotta bust our asses. </i>

750
00:56:47,078 --> 00:56:49,205
<i>Come on, bitches. Back to work. </i>

751
00:56:49,289 --> 00:56:52,083
<i>- Matt, that's my job.
- Grab your cocks and move your socks. </i>

752
00:56:52,166 --> 00:56:54,294
<i>We're at war here, people, war!</i>

753
00:56:54,377 --> 00:56:57,755
<i>Show some tits. Grow some balls.
Hey, keep that thing warm for me. </i>

754
00:56:57,839 --> 00:57:01,968
<i>All right, now. What, you want to let
Beechwood tittie-fuck us? I didn't think so. </i>

755
00:57:02,051 --> 00:57:03,386
<i>All right, Tall Oakers... </i>

756
00:57:03,469 --> 00:57:06,514
<i>we're in our final week.
Time to put on our game faces. </i>

757
00:57:06,598 --> 00:57:09,767
<i>And time to strap yourselves in
for a bumpy ride. </i>

758
00:57:09,851 --> 00:57:11,811
I want the oboe, clarinet, black thingies...

759
00:57:11,894 --> 00:57:14,689
and we've got the rhythm section
in a full-on blitz.

760
00:57:14,772 --> 00:57:16,941
- Are you with me, bandees?
- Yeah!

761
00:57:17,025 --> 00:57:19,819
<i>Competition for the Tall Oaks Cup
is really heating up. </i>

762
00:57:23,489 --> 00:57:24,991
<i>Beechwood wins. </i>

763
00:57:27,201 --> 00:57:28,244
Whatever.

764
00:57:28,328 --> 00:57:29,662
I told you, you should let me steer.

765
00:57:29,746 --> 00:57:31,414
Take that bitch home, man.

766
00:57:31,789 --> 00:57:36,169
Drive it in. Hey, you, fuck face,
I don't even know where to start with you.

767
00:57:43,009 --> 00:57:46,638
<i>Beechwood leads.
Great Falls and Lloyd are tied for second. </i>

768
00:57:46,721 --> 00:57:48,806
Beechwood licks nuts. Hut!

769
00:57:57,357 --> 00:57:59,609
<i>Victory, East Great Falls. </i>

770
00:58:02,987 --> 00:58:05,114
Right foot on line.

771
00:58:06,866 --> 00:58:08,910
Jimmy, you fucking lotion lover.

772
00:58:16,084 --> 00:58:18,711
<i>East Great Falls by four points. </i>

773
00:58:28,346 --> 00:58:30,181
Hey, butt pirates ahoy.

774
00:58:31,099 --> 00:58:34,602
Your little band
may be leading in the competition, Stifler...

775
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:38,648
but make sure to let us know
if you get thirsty.

776
00:58:38,731 --> 00:58:40,984
Yeah, 'cause there's plenty of this.

777
00:58:46,322 --> 00:58:50,285
That's funny for you dorks.
Yeah, it is, isn't it? Yeah.

778
00:58:50,493 --> 00:58:53,121
Man, screw that challenge.
I'm just gonna kick his ass.

779
00:58:53,204 --> 00:58:55,373
No, wait. I've got a better idea...

780
00:58:56,291 --> 00:58:58,334
if you think you're man enough.

781
00:59:10,388 --> 00:59:11,431
Yes.

782
00:59:11,514 --> 00:59:14,684
- Hey, you sure you can do this?
- Hey, born to be a porn star, baby.

783
00:59:14,767 --> 00:59:16,269
Delivery on demand.

784
00:59:17,353 --> 00:59:20,398
When I get back,
I'll be a million Stiflers lighter.

785
00:59:40,501 --> 00:59:42,545
Brandon, I think you're
a really good drummer, so...

786
00:59:42,629 --> 00:59:43,713
Excuse me.

787
00:59:55,975 --> 00:59:57,310
Hey, guys...

788
00:59:57,393 --> 01:00:01,147
don't forget your sunscreen.
Your bodies are your instruments.

789
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:03,316
Yeah, you don't want to be
chapped for your solos.

790
01:00:03,399 --> 01:00:05,735
No, we don't. Bye now.

791
01:00:10,990 --> 01:00:13,242
What is that, 30? It's really thick.

792
01:00:23,586 --> 01:00:25,505
How's that taste, Vande-cock?

793
01:00:26,089 --> 01:00:28,341
Good, huh? Warm and salty? Yeah.

794
01:00:28,424 --> 01:00:32,220
It's a cum-pletely new formula.
100% Stiffy juice...

795
01:00:32,303 --> 01:00:34,430
S.P.F. 69.

796
01:00:41,187 --> 01:00:42,438
Suck on that.

797
01:00:43,564 --> 01:00:45,191
- Yeah.
- Stop, man.

798
01:00:45,275 --> 01:00:46,985
- Yeah.
- Ernie.

799
01:00:47,068 --> 01:00:48,403
- Yeah.
- Ernie.

800
01:00:57,787 --> 01:01:00,415
What you had before
was way better than this.

801
01:01:00,498 --> 01:01:04,544
This sounds like
your overactive honor-society brain.

802
01:01:05,003 --> 01:01:08,798
Instead of your nasty, wet...

803
01:01:09,632 --> 01:01:11,134
dirty-girl panties.

804
01:01:12,051 --> 01:01:14,053
It should be more spontaneous.

805
01:01:17,015 --> 01:01:18,349
Stop.

806
01:01:18,433 --> 01:01:21,269
Maybe you should hang out
with your friend Matt a little bit more.

807
01:01:21,352 --> 01:01:22,395
Yeah, right.

808
01:01:22,478 --> 01:01:26,065
I know he's a dick and everything,
but he's also got one.

809
01:01:26,190 --> 01:01:30,445
Make some love music, you know?
And then your notes will just cum to you.

810
01:01:31,070 --> 01:01:34,282
- Oh, Matt!
- Stop.

811
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:35,992
Matt. Matt.

812
01:01:39,203 --> 01:01:41,664
Go long, you asshole. Go.

813
01:01:42,457 --> 01:01:44,334
Hey, Elyse.

814
01:01:45,585 --> 01:01:47,545
Throw it back. Come on.

815
01:01:48,338 --> 01:01:49,797
What you got?

816
01:01:57,472 --> 01:01:58,848
Missed. Sorry.

817
01:02:00,475 --> 01:02:02,185
Hey, if I have to ring the triangle...

818
01:02:02,268 --> 01:02:04,187
- you have to throw the football, all right?
- Okay.

819
01:02:04,270 --> 01:02:06,147
Draw your arm back. There you go.

820
01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:09,984
Shoulder to your target. Right.
Okay, now step forward.

821
01:02:10,068 --> 01:02:12,487
Come on we're not marching. One foot.

822
01:02:12,570 --> 01:02:15,448
- Okay.
- You're fine. Ready? There you go.

823
01:02:15,698 --> 01:02:17,075
Draw the ball over your ear...

824
01:02:17,158 --> 01:02:20,328
and when you throw it, let it roll
right off your fingers, all right?

825
01:02:21,537 --> 01:02:22,664
Okay.

826
01:02:22,997 --> 01:02:24,457
Come on, throw it.

827
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:32,173
See? I taught you something. What?

828
01:02:32,257 --> 01:02:34,759
So every time I throw it,
you're gonna run and go get it?

829
01:02:34,842 --> 01:02:36,594
That's generally how it works.

830
01:02:36,678 --> 01:02:38,513
Like playing fetch with my dog.

831
01:02:38,596 --> 01:02:42,392
- Yeah, except I don't lick my own balls.
- You would if you could.

832
01:02:42,725 --> 01:02:43,768
Oh, yeah.

833
01:02:45,395 --> 01:02:46,562
Okay, again.

834
01:02:47,522 --> 01:02:48,731
Right here.

835
01:02:49,941 --> 01:02:52,568
Look, that one looks like a bunny.

836
01:02:52,902 --> 01:02:54,821
No, it doesn't.

837
01:02:56,155 --> 01:02:58,241
Maybe a bunny with one nut.

838
01:02:58,449 --> 01:03:01,202
- No, that's its tail.
- Whatever you say.

839
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:07,667
- You think we'll win this thing?
- Hell, yeah, we will.

840
01:03:07,792 --> 01:03:12,088
- Lf you write in a bagpipe part.
- Oh, God, I'll never make that mistake again.

841
01:03:12,171 --> 01:03:15,216
- What?
- The eighth grade recital.

842
01:03:16,259 --> 01:03:18,720
You made me write in a part for you.

843
01:03:21,014 --> 01:03:22,974
You wore your kilt.

844
01:03:24,350 --> 01:03:26,853
Yeah, Steve showed up with his friends.

845
01:03:27,478 --> 01:03:29,689
They gave me so much shit for that.

846
01:03:30,023 --> 01:03:32,400
I didn't come out of my room for days.

847
01:03:32,692 --> 01:03:35,903
You made it up to him
by stealing all my underwear...

848
01:03:35,987 --> 01:03:38,364
so you could run them up the flagpole.

849
01:03:39,324 --> 01:03:41,159
Including my training bras.

850
01:03:44,245 --> 01:03:46,873
Okay, since we're having
some big fucking Oprah moment here...

851
01:03:46,956 --> 01:03:49,000
I'm sorry about your underwear.

852
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:50,752
And the diary.

853
01:03:53,504 --> 01:03:55,465
And all that other shit, too.

854
01:04:35,755 --> 01:04:36,881
That's it.

855
01:04:37,423 --> 01:04:40,301
- You started it.
- This is gonna get me that scholarship.

856
01:04:40,385 --> 01:04:41,427
What?

857
01:04:41,511 --> 01:04:44,180
I've got to go write this down
before I forget.

858
01:04:46,057 --> 01:04:47,433
Hey. Hey. Hey.

859
01:04:49,269 --> 01:04:51,312
Could we do this again tomorrow night?

860
01:04:51,396 --> 01:04:54,274
Yeah, sure. I'll see you here at sunset.

861
01:04:54,774 --> 01:04:56,109
Hey.

862
01:04:57,068 --> 01:04:59,529
Should I bring that Picardo thing?

863
01:04:59,612 --> 01:05:01,864
Okay, I'll do a solo for you.

864
01:05:12,041 --> 01:05:13,751
- What's up, Ernie?
- Hey.

865
01:05:32,770 --> 01:05:34,772
It was that fugly nurse again.

866
01:05:49,871 --> 01:05:51,706
Oh, my God.

867
01:05:51,789 --> 01:05:53,124
Matt Stifler?

868
01:05:53,875 --> 01:05:58,546
- Holy shit, look at you.
- Arrianna, what are you doing here?

869
01:05:58,630 --> 01:06:01,966
We practice our routine with the band.
What are you doing here?

870
01:06:02,050 --> 01:06:04,469
I had to come. The school made me.

871
01:06:05,428 --> 01:06:08,848
- Does anybody know about this yet?
- Oh, they do now.

872
01:06:09,891 --> 01:06:13,061
Hey, come on, no pictures.
What're you, the papa-tit-zzy?

873
01:06:13,144 --> 01:06:14,896
- Holy shit, this is so hilarious.
- Smile.

874
01:06:14,979 --> 01:06:18,816
Ladies. No time for fraternizing.

875
01:06:19,817 --> 01:06:23,905
Get the bags.
Guess I'll see you around, bandee.

876
01:06:24,072 --> 01:06:28,326
What a dork.
I'm going to email this to everybody.

877
01:06:50,682 --> 01:06:53,476
Girls, that was great. Percussion, take five.

878
01:06:53,559 --> 01:06:55,311
Horns, we've got to work on intonation.

879
01:06:55,395 --> 01:06:58,022
The final performance is tomorrow,
you guys.

880
01:06:58,856 --> 01:07:00,692
They're so lame.

881
01:07:01,693 --> 01:07:04,070
You play the triangle. How cute.

882
01:07:04,904 --> 01:07:08,074
No, I don't. Look, I told you...

883
01:07:08,741 --> 01:07:10,076
- I had to...
- I gotta go.

884
01:07:10,159 --> 01:07:13,496
- I don't socialize with bandees.
- I'm not a fucking bandee.

885
01:07:13,871 --> 01:07:17,542
I'm not. Look.
I've just been acting like a geek.

886
01:07:17,834 --> 01:07:20,795
I've been playing them
so I could get them on hidden video.

887
01:07:20,878 --> 01:07:24,424
I've been secretly videotaping them
doing all this crazy shit.

888
01:07:25,383 --> 01:07:28,386
- Really?
- Yeah, I could show you.

889
01:07:31,014 --> 01:07:33,349
Okay, come by after dinner.

890
01:07:33,850 --> 01:07:36,477
I'll leave my pompoms
in the window for you.

891
01:08:09,969 --> 01:08:12,680
- You're late.
- Yeah, no shit. Open the window.

892
01:08:16,017 --> 01:08:17,936
Hold on. Be careful with it.

893
01:08:27,028 --> 01:08:30,281
All right, one condition
before I show you the fruits of my labors.

894
01:08:30,365 --> 01:08:31,574
What's that?

895
01:08:31,908 --> 01:08:34,744
I want that picture
on that camera phone erased.

896
01:08:46,381 --> 01:08:49,509
<i>Nobody at school hears
about the triangle or the beanie. </i>

897
01:08:49,592 --> 01:08:52,220
<i>I don't want anybody
to think I'm a dorky-ass bandee. </i>

898
01:08:52,303 --> 01:08:54,138
<i>Fine. Like, now can we get on with it?</i>

899
01:08:54,222 --> 01:08:57,684
<i>As soon as you get rid of that picture
of me on your phone. </i>

900
01:09:12,073 --> 01:09:14,909
<i>Are you going into town?
Not tonight. I'm too tired. </i>

901
01:09:14,993 --> 01:09:17,620
Besides, they're much hotter here.

902
01:09:17,704 --> 01:09:20,623
I know. It's a great crop this year.

903
01:09:35,430 --> 01:09:39,350
- There. Done deal.
- Now can we see the video?

904
01:09:40,226 --> 01:09:41,853
Stiffmeister Productions...

905
01:09:41,936 --> 01:09:45,523
in association with
its talented new director, Matthew Stifler...

906
01:09:45,607 --> 01:09:47,609
is happy to premier the unedited...

907
01:09:47,692 --> 01:09:52,155
<i>unfiltered, and un-fucking-believable
Bandeez Gone Wild. </i>

908
01:09:53,489 --> 01:09:54,657
Oh, yeah.

909
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:02,749
- Oh, my God.
- That is unbelievable.

910
01:10:25,396 --> 01:10:27,732
- You're kidding me, right?
- That's great.

911
01:10:29,192 --> 01:10:32,362
<i>Danielle likes Jimmy,
but she's like a foot taller than him. </i>

912
01:10:32,445 --> 01:10:33,905
<i>And wait till you hear this. </i>

913
01:10:33,988 --> 01:10:36,574
Sheree slept with that big Oscar guy,
the drummer.

914
01:10:36,658 --> 01:10:38,159
Said he was amazing.

915
01:10:38,743 --> 01:10:41,955
I hooked up with Brandon once.
Some drummer. He has...

916
01:10:42,038 --> 01:10:43,873
<i>no rhythm,
and he can't even bang very long. </i>

917
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:45,833
<i>Oh, my God. Are you serious?</i>

918
01:10:45,917 --> 01:10:50,088
<i>Yeah, he's a preemie. I'm not talking
about the day he was born, either. </i>

919
01:10:51,130 --> 01:10:53,883
Can you get my back?
I think I got a little bit of sun today?

920
01:10:53,967 --> 01:10:55,009
Sure.

921
01:10:55,218 --> 01:10:58,137
Get this. He has one ball.

922
01:10:58,721 --> 01:11:01,057
No way.
One ball.

923
01:11:02,183 --> 01:11:05,144
Yeah, that why he carries that big stick
around everywhere.

924
01:11:05,228 --> 01:11:07,272
It's got his other ball on top.

925
01:11:10,483 --> 01:11:12,277
Shit, shit, oh, shit.

926
01:11:15,321 --> 01:11:16,823
What is that thing?

927
01:11:30,878 --> 01:11:32,213
Let's kill it.

928
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:34,841
- Where'd he go?
- There he is.

929
01:11:34,924 --> 01:11:36,050
Look out.

930
01:12:15,965 --> 01:12:17,884
This is going into the lake.

931
01:12:18,927 --> 01:12:21,429
No one's gonna know
about your little video.

932
01:12:21,512 --> 01:12:24,140
'Cause the shit you got us doing on tape...

933
01:12:29,187 --> 01:12:32,857
So we got a contest to win tomorrow.
And I don't want to see you.

934
01:12:33,232 --> 01:12:34,400
Understand?

935
01:12:40,531 --> 01:12:41,950
Did you help him?

936
01:13:06,933 --> 01:13:08,601
<i>With East Great Falls
in the lead... </i>

937
01:13:08,685 --> 01:13:11,437
<i>Beechwood has to win
the Band Camp Playoffs. </i>

938
01:13:11,562 --> 01:13:13,773
<i>Direct yourselves to the marching field
in one hour. </i>

939
01:13:15,233 --> 01:13:18,611
Now, Dr. Choi, Brandon Vandecamp
from Beechwood...

940
01:13:18,695 --> 01:13:20,989
is our best musician by far...

941
01:13:21,072 --> 01:13:26,077
and his father, Landon,
is our best donor, also by far.

942
01:13:26,995 --> 01:13:31,249
Robards needs talented musicians
as much as we need talented donors.

943
01:13:38,715 --> 01:13:40,049
Ipecac.

944
01:13:42,427 --> 01:13:45,638
- So how's it going? Are you having fun?
- It's okay.

945
01:13:51,060 --> 01:13:53,271
How about some Ipecac, Vande-cooch?

946
01:13:56,190 --> 01:14:00,069
This herbal fucking extract will help you
Beechwood fief play in tune, huh?

947
01:14:01,613 --> 01:14:02,655
Shit.

948
01:14:12,123 --> 01:14:14,542
I told you
I don't want to see you anymore, Stifler.

949
01:14:14,626 --> 01:14:16,794
Some day, you'll thank me, asshole.

950
01:14:21,591 --> 01:14:24,302
- Orange?
- Again?

951
01:14:24,844 --> 01:14:26,888
- Damn.
- That orange shit is janky.

952
01:14:26,971 --> 01:14:28,890
I'm feeling grape, dawg.

953
01:14:31,768 --> 01:14:35,730
I don't care how many times they
won. They're not getting the grape today.

954
01:14:35,813 --> 01:14:38,191
That's what I'm talking about.

955
01:14:39,859 --> 01:14:42,737
<i>Your five-time defending
champion... </i>

956
01:14:43,363 --> 01:14:45,198
<i>Beechwood Academy. </i>

957
01:15:17,272 --> 01:15:20,525
- They're tight.
- Yeah, they're better then ever this year.

958
01:15:20,608 --> 01:15:22,068
Okay, everybody.

959
01:15:22,568 --> 01:15:24,779
It's no surprise Beechwood is good.

960
01:15:25,154 --> 01:15:28,700
But this year is different.
This year, we can beat them.

961
01:15:29,617 --> 01:15:32,829
We've worked hard,
and we are good enough...

962
01:15:32,912 --> 01:15:35,498
and this is our time, so lets win the cup.

963
01:15:35,581 --> 01:15:37,584
Yeah!

964
01:16:12,493 --> 01:16:14,203
<i>Beechwood Academy. </i>

965
01:16:14,287 --> 01:16:17,832
<i>Their music today was composed

966
01:16:17,915 --> 01:16:19,876
<i>Brandon Vandecamp. </i>

967
01:16:20,043 --> 01:16:21,169
Beat that.

968
01:16:24,130 --> 01:16:27,675
<i>East Great Falls,
you may enter the field for competition. </i>

969
01:16:44,984 --> 01:16:48,154
Band 10 hut. One, two, ready.
Shit.

970
01:16:48,237 --> 01:16:49,822
Leesy, wait, no.

971
01:16:49,906 --> 01:16:51,950
No. Wait.

972
01:17:02,252 --> 01:17:04,587
You know, I'm so sorry.
I don't know what happened.

973
01:17:04,671 --> 01:17:06,839
Not my shoes. Here we go.

974
01:17:11,678 --> 01:17:12,762
Stifler!

975
01:17:30,613 --> 01:17:32,865
You know, you're like
your brother, Steve.

976
01:17:32,949 --> 01:17:36,577
And I don't think those are the shoes
you should be so eager to fill.

977
01:17:36,661 --> 01:17:39,747
You know, the people
Steve thought were his friends...

978
01:17:39,872 --> 01:17:42,500
- really didn't like him very much.
- What?

979
01:17:42,584 --> 01:17:44,043
But I think you're different.

980
01:17:44,127 --> 01:17:48,381
I think people want to like you, Matt.
You just make it really hard.

981
01:18:02,729 --> 01:18:06,608
Parting is such sweet sorrow.
When you're a loser.

982
01:18:13,156 --> 01:18:17,452
Mr. Levenstein reports
that there were a few incidents...

983
01:18:17,535 --> 01:18:18,828
at camp.

984
01:18:19,329 --> 01:18:21,831
But he also says that...

985
01:18:21,956 --> 01:18:25,710
you bonded with the band briefly.

986
01:18:29,756 --> 01:18:34,010
When school starts,
you're going to be on a very short leash.

987
01:18:34,218 --> 01:18:37,972
Remember, the Shermanator sees it all.

988
01:18:39,349 --> 01:18:40,642
Be gone.

989
01:18:45,563 --> 01:18:47,774
Did everybody hate my brother?

990
01:18:59,118 --> 01:19:02,747
Stardate: August 21, 2005.

991
01:19:03,331 --> 01:19:05,708
Some progress made with Stiffy Junior.

992
01:19:06,125 --> 01:19:08,586
Behavior modification evident.

993
01:19:10,046 --> 01:19:11,798
Will continue to monitor.

994
01:19:12,423 --> 01:19:14,676
Shermanator out.

995
01:19:25,812 --> 01:19:28,273
A little "Double-D Sheree" action.

996
01:19:32,860 --> 01:19:34,737
Little bit of Dr. Robot.

997
01:19:36,572 --> 01:19:38,074
Crazy fucker.

998
01:20:46,267 --> 01:20:47,602
Hey, Stifler, where's your instrument?

999
01:20:47,685 --> 01:20:48,895
Dude, you're in the wrong uniform.

1000
01:20:48,978 --> 01:20:51,773
Screw them, dude. They're gonna freak out
when they see the video.

1001
01:20:51,856 --> 01:20:54,067
Look, we thought that if we had
an advance screening...

1002
01:20:54,150 --> 01:20:56,235
then everyone would see
that you're not really a dork.

1003
01:20:56,319 --> 01:20:58,696
I can't. It's gone.

1004
01:20:59,739 --> 01:21:02,909
- What?
- The video, man, I deleted it.

1005
01:21:03,910 --> 01:21:04,953
Why?

1006
01:21:05,870 --> 01:21:08,539
Guess little bro's quitting
the family business.

1007
01:21:08,623 --> 01:21:10,124
Are you kidding me?

1008
01:21:13,670 --> 01:21:15,588
He went fucking bandee on us.

1009
01:21:31,980 --> 01:21:33,523
Hey, what's up, guys?

1010
01:21:34,315 --> 01:21:36,276
You a dead man, motherfucker.

1011
01:21:37,068 --> 01:21:39,070
- You, too, little man.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1012
01:21:39,404 --> 01:21:43,283
Dude, the purple puke was an accident.
Somebody switched the coolers.

1013
01:21:47,996 --> 01:21:50,206
Hey, that orange shit is janky, yo.

1014
01:21:50,915 --> 01:21:55,753
Chloe, we never saw Elyse,
you know, naked.

1015
01:21:56,504 --> 01:21:58,464
Matt turned off the computer.

1016
01:21:59,340 --> 01:22:01,926
So we're just supposed to forgive him now?

1017
01:22:03,011 --> 01:22:05,722
- He's still an asshole.
- You're right.

1018
01:22:06,723 --> 01:22:08,057
I am an asshole.

1019
01:22:08,474 --> 01:22:10,727
I can't take back spying on you...

1020
01:22:10,810 --> 01:22:13,187
and I can't win that Bandee Cup thing.

1021
01:22:13,313 --> 01:22:16,190
But I can help someone
get what she deserves.

1022
01:22:17,025 --> 01:22:19,193
I'm not asking you to forgive me.

1023
01:22:19,402 --> 01:22:21,988
Just help me help Elyse.

1024
01:22:32,915 --> 01:22:35,376
- I got the number.
- Go ahead.

1025
01:22:35,460 --> 01:22:39,005
555-0171.

1026
01:22:41,007 --> 01:22:43,760
He shouldn't have been dumping Ipecac
in anyone's cooler.

1027
01:22:43,843 --> 01:22:45,678
We could've won on our own.

1028
01:22:47,972 --> 01:22:52,268
I don't even care that he saw me on camera.
Well, I mean I do, but...

1029
01:22:53,353 --> 01:22:55,605
Honey, this just came for you.

1030
01:22:59,359 --> 01:23:00,818
It's from Robards.

1031
01:23:02,278 --> 01:23:03,571
What's it say?

1032
01:23:05,323 --> 01:23:07,909
Dr. Choi wants to meet with me?

1033
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:27,762
- Okay.
- Okay.

1034
01:23:27,971 --> 01:23:29,889
- Okay.
- Okay.

1035
01:23:31,557 --> 01:23:32,642
Bye.

1036
01:23:48,866 --> 01:23:51,286
Hi. Elyse Houston.

1037
01:23:52,495 --> 01:23:55,248
I have an appointment with Dr. Choi.

1038
01:23:56,332 --> 01:23:59,919
- You're not in the book.
- No, there must be some mistake. See...

1039
01:24:01,879 --> 01:24:03,256
I have a letter.

1040
01:24:08,761 --> 01:24:10,638
This letter is, well...

1041
01:24:11,431 --> 01:24:12,640
It's a fake.

1042
01:24:13,141 --> 01:24:16,060
- This is not Dr. Choi's signature.
- What?

1043
01:24:29,282 --> 01:24:30,408
Stifler.

1044
01:24:34,203 --> 01:24:36,456
You son of a bitch.

1045
01:24:38,124 --> 01:24:42,503
What? It wasn't enough
for you to humiliate me at Band Camp?

1046
01:24:42,587 --> 01:24:45,256
Now you have to set me up here?

1047
01:25:05,693 --> 01:25:07,403
What's going on here?

1048
01:25:08,863 --> 01:25:10,323
This is my band.

1049
01:25:10,782 --> 01:25:12,659
And that's her music.

1050
01:26:10,967 --> 01:26:12,010
Well...

1051
01:26:12,594 --> 01:26:16,306
I've certainly seen some interesting attempts
to gain admission...

1052
01:26:16,973 --> 01:26:18,600
but this is a first.

1053
01:26:20,143 --> 01:26:24,355
Excellent audition, Miss. Houston.
Let's go discuss that scholarship.

1054
01:26:25,815 --> 01:26:27,317
I thought Brandon won.

1055
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:30,737
No, Mr. Vandecamp
was disqualified for plagiarism.

1056
01:26:30,820 --> 01:26:31,946
All right.

1057
01:26:34,157 --> 01:26:36,200
That's what I'm talking about, yo.

1058
01:26:40,371 --> 01:26:42,749
Oh, my God, you guys, that was amazing.

1059
01:26:43,333 --> 01:26:47,378
- Thank you so much.
- Thank him. It was his idea.

1060
01:26:47,462 --> 01:26:48,504
Word.

1061
01:26:51,299 --> 01:26:54,928
- You planned all this?
- With some friends.

1062
01:26:57,847 --> 01:26:59,140
Come here.

1063
01:27:03,770 --> 01:27:06,147
Oh, I believe this is yours.

1064
01:27:07,565 --> 01:27:08,733
You know...

1065
01:27:09,442 --> 01:27:13,488
Picardo is a brand of piccolo.

1066
01:27:14,447 --> 01:27:16,783
You really are an asshole sometimes...

1067
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:18,242
Stiffy.
