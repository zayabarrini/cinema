00:08:14,315 --> 00:08:18,861
Free paper. Ha ha!
Shit, son.

171
00:08:18,903 --> 00:08:21,155
Yeah, so how
you digging college?

172
00:08:21,197 --> 00:08:22,406
I don't know.

173
00:08:22,448 --> 00:08:24,909
It's OK, I guess.

174
00:08:24,951 --> 00:08:27,285
I feel like such a geek
sometimes, though.

175
00:08:27,286 --> 00:08:29,872
Everyone is so cool,
and I'm... not.

176
00:08:29,914 --> 00:08:31,999
Oh, come on, Cindy.

177
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:33,459
You ain't that bad.

178
00:08:33,501 --> 00:08:35,461
All you need is
a little bit of flavor.

179
00:08:35,503 --> 00:08:37,046
Hmm. Maybe some new gear.

180
00:08:37,088 --> 00:08:38,297
"Gear?"

181
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:39,632
That's slang for "clothing."

182
00:08:39,674 --> 00:08:41,634
- Oh.
- Here. Come on.

183
00:08:41,676 --> 00:08:43,052
We gonna cool you up right now.

184
00:08:43,094 --> 00:08:46,681
Don't sit like this,
first of all.

185
00:08:46,722 --> 00:08:48,766
Don't sit like that, son.
Sit cool.

186
00:08:48,808 --> 00:08:50,685
- OK.
- Right up, son.

187
00:08:50,726 --> 00:08:52,770
Feel yourself, son, like that.

188
00:08:52,812 --> 00:08:54,105
Yeah. Now go like this.

189
00:08:54,146 --> 00:08:56,357
Uh. Uh, yeah.

190
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,359
- That's cool.
- Yeah.

191
00:08:58,401 --> 00:09:00,027
Yeah. Now stand up,
let me show you some moves.

192
00:09:00,069 --> 00:09:01,112
Right, left.

193
00:09:01,153 --> 00:09:02,405
Right, left.

194
00:09:02,446 --> 00:09:04,573
Uh, son. Uh!

195
00:09:04,615 --> 00:09:05,866
BOTH: Right, left.

196
00:09:05,908 --> 00:09:07,076
Right, kick.

197
00:09:07,118 --> 00:09:08,119
Uh, son.

198
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,370
Uh, psych.

199
00:09:09,412 --> 00:09:10,454
Throw a little bit
of slang in there.

200
00:09:10,496 --> 00:09:14,292
Say, "Yo, that jacket
is tight, son. Ya mean?"

201
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:17,086
Yo, that jacket is tight, son.

202
00:09:17,128 --> 00:09:18,838
- Ya mean?
- Ya mean?

203
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:21,882
Yeah, something like that.

204
00:09:21,924 --> 00:09:22,883
Throw it all together.

205
00:09:22,925 --> 00:09:24,510
OK. Right, left.

206
00:09:24,552 --> 00:09:26,220
Right, kick, uh!

207
00:09:26,262 --> 00:09:28,389
Yo, that jacket is tight.

208
00:09:28,431 --> 00:09:31,517
Now run that shit, bitch.
Ya mean?

209
00:09:33,561 --> 00:09:35,604
That is the shit, dog.

210
00:09:35,646 --> 00:09:38,691
Oh, man.
You boners aren't ready yet?

211
00:09:38,733 --> 00:09:40,818
Dude, relax, man.
I'm telling you,

212
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,820
We 'll get there on time,
all right?

213
00:09:42,862 --> 00:09:44,655
Yo, dogs, what y'all think?

214
00:09:44,697 --> 00:09:46,365
Tucked in or out?

215
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:49,118
- Out, man.
- Out, man. Come on.

216
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,621
No doubt. No doubt.
That's what I thought.

217
00:09:51,662 --> 00:09:54,332
You fuckheads would be ready if
you weren't partying all night.

218
00:09:54,373 --> 00:09:56,709
Come on, man.
It was so awesome.

219
00:09:56,751 --> 00:09:58,085
We got so wasted, man!

220
00:09:58,127 --> 00:09:59,795
I had, like, a keg myself.

221
00:09:59,837 --> 00:10:01,922
I woke up naked
in a tub of ice.

222
00:10:01,964 --> 00:10:03,007
All right!

223
00:10:03,049 --> 00:10:04,507
Yeah, man.

224
00:10:04,508 --> 00:10:07,762
Oh, shit, Ray,
you got a tattoo.

225
00:10:07,803 --> 00:10:10,056
Oh, shit.
What's it say?

226
00:10:10,097 --> 00:10:12,266
"Ray!" Oh, man.

227
00:10:12,308 --> 00:10:14,184
Oh, shit,
you got a tattoo, too.

228
00:10:14,185 --> 00:10:15,269
Oh, really? Dude!

229
00:10:15,311 --> 00:10:17,146
Dude, what's it say?

230
00:10:17,188 --> 00:10:18,689
"Fucked me."

231
00:10:18,731 --> 00:10:20,650
Oh, sweet, man.
"Ray..."

232
00:10:20,691 --> 00:10:21,901
"Fucked me."

233
00:10:21,942 --> 00:10:24,028
- "Ray..."
- "Fucked me."

234

BOTH: "Ray fucked me."

235
00:10:25,947 --> 00:10:28,824
Yeah! Ha ha! Whoo!

236
00:10:28,866 --> 00:10:30,868
What, man?

237
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,161
Oh.

238
00:10:32,203 --> 00:10:33,829
Wedgie moment! Ha ha!

239
00:10:33,871 --> 00:10:37,291
Come on. You're gonna give me
a yeast infection.

240
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:38,960
Hey, girl, that jacket
is slamming.

241
00:10:39,001 --> 00:10:39,961
Thanks.

242
00:10:40,002 --> 00:10:41,128
You better be careful, though.

243
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,421
Some girl
got an ass-whipping...

244
00:10:42,463 --> 00:10:44,173
over a jacket
stolen earlier today.

245
00:10:44,215 --> 00:10:46,509
Some people is so ghetto.

246
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,678
What class we got next?

247
00:10:48,719 --> 00:10:49,804
Psychology.

248
00:10:49,845 --> 00:10:52,014
Oh! Me, too! 101?

249
00:10:52,056 --> 00:10:54,934
- In room 302 at 10?00?
- That's it!

250
00:10:54,976 --> 00:10:57,478
Oh! Uh-uh!
No. This is too much.

251
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,771
I got these psychic powers
on line.

252
00:10:58,813 --> 00:11:01,315
Remind me to get
a lotto ticket tomorrow.

253
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:03,317
Oh, don't split the pole now.

254
00:11:03,359 --> 00:11:06,112
That is very, very bad luck.
My psychic told me.

255
00:11:06,153 --> 00:11:08,531
ALEX: You don't really believe
in that stuff, do you?

256
00:11:08,572 --> 00:11:10,532
BRENDA: Yes, I do. Very much.

257

[ Horn honks ]

258
00:11:16,664 --> 00:11:18,332
Are these all the subjects?

259
00:11:18,374 --> 00:11:20,459
Yes, sir.
I took the liberty of putting...

260
00:11:20,501 --> 00:11:22,878
those with near-death
experiences on the very top.

261
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:24,379
Any of them hot?

262
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:27,591
As I'm sure you are aware,
Professor...

263
00:11:27,633 --> 00:11:30,803
subjects who are close to death
are statistically more likely...

264
00:11:30,845 --> 00:11:32,555
to have
the suggestibility required...

265
00:11:32,596 --> 00:11:35,599
for paranormal investigation,
which is why, of course...

266
00:11:35,641 --> 00:11:38,519
I gave them
special consideration.

267
00:11:38,561 --> 00:11:40,146
Oh, good thinking, Dwight.

268
00:11:40,187 --> 00:11:42,565
Traumatized coeds
are a sure thing.

269
00:11:45,568 --> 00:11:46,944
PROFESSOR: Ooh, I like her.

270
00:11:46,986 --> 00:11:48,404
Oh, yes, sir.
That is Cindy Campbell...

271
00:11:48,405 --> 00:11:51,616
classic abandoned
personality disorder.

272
00:11:51,657 --> 00:11:53,534
She seems guarded, but willing.

273
00:11:54,577 --> 00:11:56,203
And this?

274
00:11:56,245 --> 00:11:57,872
That is Ray Wilkins, sir.

275
00:11:57,913 --> 00:11:59,457
I couldn't quite
figure him out...

276
00:11:59,498 --> 00:12:01,792
but he seemed very eager
and pleased to meet me.

277
00:12:01,834 --> 00:12:04,045
What's this?

278
00:12:04,086 --> 00:12:08,799
It's a picture that he sent
after the interview.

279
00:12:08,841 --> 00:12:11,719
Where did you find these kids?

280
00:12:11,761 --> 00:12:13,262
Sir, they're all survivors...

281

of the Stevenston County
Massacre.

282

Oh, fantastic!

283
00:12:19,435 --> 00:12:23,022
These kids are exactly
the catalyst we need...

284

to awaken
the spirits of Hell House.

285
00:12:26,776 --> 00:12:30,196
Sir, exactly how are we going
to get them up there?

286
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:31,864
We'll tell them...

287
00:12:31,906 --> 00:12:33,491
it's part of the class.

288
00:12:33,532 --> 00:12:36,702
We'll say... excuse me...

289
00:12:36,744 --> 00:12:38,037
that they're participating
in a study...

290

We are going to spend

where we've established
a controlled environment...

304
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:17,743
in which we'll study
your various sleep disorders.

directions...

- No, Dwight.

I'm sorry, Buddy.

What? So you think
I did this to myself?

832
00:36:11,321 --> 00:36:13,615
No. All I'm saying
is that cats are known...

833
00:36:13,657 --> 00:36:15,701
to be very
territorial animals...

834
00:36:15,742 --> 00:36:17,744
and it's likely
that it did attack...

835
00:36:17,786 --> 00:36:20,455
but that doesn't mean
it was possessed.

this cat did attack...

Let me help you.

DWIGHT:
I don't need your help.

I can do it myself.

OK. Professor,

PROFESSOR:
What is it, Dwight?

1000
00:43:59,289 --> 00:44:00,374
DWIGHT: I think
you should consider...

1001
00:44:00,415 --> 00:44:02,292
cutting the experiment short.

1002
00:44:02,334 --> 00:44:03,752
What?

1003
00:44:03,794 --> 00:44:06,252
This poltergeist is growing
increasingly more violent.

1004
00:44:06,253 --> 00:44:07,839
I think we're all
in danger here...

1005
00:44:07,881 --> 00:44:09,716
and I've got to put
my foot down...

1006
00:44:09,758 --> 00:44:10,759
and stand up for
what I believe in...

1007
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:13,095
and say that
we've got to pull the plug.

1008
00:44:13,136 --> 00:44:15,389
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, Dwight.

We are on the verge

to getting laid.

Guys, I think
the Professor's up to something.

1018
00:44:37,953 --> 00:44:39,579
I heard Dwight
tell the Professor...

1019
00:44:39,621 --> 00:44:40,914
there could be
a poltergeist in the house...

and that we could all
be in danger!

No. We can't go anywhere.

01:18:50,710 --> 01:18:52,045
She kept it coming

1808
01:18:52,086 --> 01:18:54,422
It was hypnotic and so erotic

1809
01:18:54,464 --> 01:18:56,090
I tried,
but I just couldn't stop it

1810
01:18:56,132 --> 01:18:57,467
She kept it coming

1811
01:18:57,508 --> 01:18:59,594
It was hypnotic and so erotic

1812
01:18:59,636 --> 01:19:01,512
I tried,
but I just couldn't stop it

1813
01:19:01,513 --> 01:19:03,389
She kept it coming

1814
01:19:06,684 --> 01:19:09,145
She kept it coming

1815
01:19:09,187 --> 01:19:12,065
[ New song begins ]

1816
01:19:17,195 --> 01:19:23,952
Ooh, when it's dark outside

1817
01:19:23,993 --> 01:19:28,665
All my fears arise

1818
01:19:28,706 --> 01:19:33,586
When it's dark outside

1819
01:19:33,628 --> 01:19:36,923
All my fears

1820
01:19:36,965 --> 01:19:41,844
Sun's gone down,
the light's all gone

1821
01:19:41,886 --> 01:19:46,432
Big-ass house
and we're alone

1822
01:19:46,474 --> 01:19:48,768
I hear voices,
what I'm-a do?

1823
01:19:48,810 --> 01:19:51,187
Hear those noises,
what I'm-a do?

1824
01:19:51,229 --> 01:19:54,023
What's my choice here,
run like a fool?

1825
01:19:54,065 --> 01:19:56,693
I'm long gone

1826
01:19:56,734 --> 01:19:58,736
- Shh.
- What's that sound?

1827
01:19:58,778 --> 01:20:01,197
Everybody look
what's floating round

1828
01:20:01,239 --> 01:20:03,199
Not too sure of what I see

1829
01:20:03,241 --> 01:20:05,827
All I know is it's scaring me

1830
01:20:05,868 --> 01:20:12,417
Ooh, when it's dark outside

1831
01:20:12,458 --> 01:20:17,171
All my fears arise

1832
01:20:17,255 --> 01:20:22,093
When it's dark outside

1833
01:20:22,135 --> 01:20:25,555
All my fears

1834
01:20:25,596 --> 01:20:27,932
And just when
you think it's over

1835
01:20:27,974 --> 01:20:32,770
Some new sound
is coming towards me

1836
01:20:32,812 --> 01:20:34,856
Getting loud

1837
01:20:34,897 --> 01:20:37,275
I hear noises,
where I'm-a go?

1838
01:20:37,317 --> 01:20:39,777
Hear those voices,
head for the door

1839
01:20:39,819 --> 01:20:42,488
What's my plan?
Don't know anymore

1840
01:20:42,530 --> 01:20:45,283
Something's wrong

1841
01:20:45,325 --> 01:20:47,035
- Shh.
- What's that sound?

1842
01:20:47,076 --> 01:20:49,996
Everybody look
what's going down

1843
01:20:50,038 --> 01:20:51,998
And why won't you let me be?

1844
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:54,459
Go right now, you're scaring me

1845
01:20:54,500 --> 01:21:01,007
Ooh, when it's dark outside

1846
01:21:01,049 --> 01:21:05,762
All my fears arise

1847
01:21:05,803 --> 01:21:10,600
When it's dark outside

1848
01:21:10,642 --> 01:21:13,895
All my fears

1849
01:21:13,936 --> 01:21:20,485
Ooh, when it's dark outside

1850
01:21:20,526 --> 01:21:25,239
All my fears arise

1851
01:21:25,281 --> 01:21:30,078
When it's dark outside

1852
01:21:30,119 --> 01:21:34,415
All my fears

1853
01:21:34,457 --> 01:21:36,167
Here's something, so get back

1854
01:21:36,209 --> 01:21:38,670
Shorty looking at me like,
"Yo, let me hit that"

1855
01:21:38,711 --> 01:21:40,797
Footsteps in the dark,
whatcha gone do?

1856
01:21:40,838 --> 01:21:41,881
I was talking to this chicken

1857
01:21:41,965 --> 01:21:43,341
Oh. Shit.

1858
01:21:43,383 --> 01:21:44,425
Is this a poltergeist
or a heist?

1859
01:21:44,467 --> 01:21:45,843
She robs some

1860
01:21:45,885 --> 01:21:47,053
All the jewels, murdering tools

1861
01:21:47,095 --> 01:21:48,096
We got some

1862
01:21:48,137 --> 01:21:49,180
Like cha-cha

1863
01:21:49,222 --> 01:21:50,431
Ready to open up shop

1864
01:21:50,473 --> 01:21:51,557
Wreak havoc on the block

1865
01:21:51,599 --> 01:21:52,684
Now love it, don't stop

1866
01:21:52,725 --> 01:21:54,060
Come on

1867
01:21:54,102 --> 01:21:59,774
Ooh, when it's dark outside

1868
01:21:59,816 --> 01:22:03,236
All my fears arise

1869
01:22:03,278 --> 01:22:09,616
Ooh, when it's dark outside

1870
01:22:09,617 --> 01:22:14,330
All my fears arise

1871
01:22:14,372 --> 01:22:17,168
When it's dark outside.

1872
01:22:18,168 --> 01:22:22,368
Sync: Pele144

1873
01:22:22,968 --> 01:22:26,368
