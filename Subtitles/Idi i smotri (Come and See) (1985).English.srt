00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:14,705
Are you crazy? What the shit?

3
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,218
What the hell are you doing?

4
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:22,918
You playing games?

5
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:27,927
Who are you playing with?

6
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:34,232
With whom? You're digging?

7
00:00:36,636 --> 00:00:38,331
You're digging again!

8
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,942
All right, go on digging, bastards!

9
00:00:44,644 --> 00:00:46,612
You goddamn bastards!

10
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:50,680
So you are hiding?

11
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:55,852
But you can't hide anymore!

12
00:00:58,491 --> 00:01:02,257
They'll find you even underground.
They'll get you!

13
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:07,433
Come out! Do as I told you!

14
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:11,436
Come on, get out!

15
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:16,205
It's you I'm talking to!

16
00:01:18,945 --> 00:01:25,509
Do this, do that!
Wipe your ass with your fingers!

17
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:31,721
Ordering me around like
another Flemish idiot!

18
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:35,351
That's what I used to be,
now I'm a German idiot!

19
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,695
We'll see about this

20
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:41,322
You won't obey your uncle,
you'll obey a strong stick!

21
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:45,733
Get up!

22
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:53,401
They're hiding,
shitting cans!

23
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,946
The pioneers of hiding!

24
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:59,445
You're only good for one thing：
milking goats or slopping pigs!

25
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:04,883
You laughing?
You won't laugh for long

26
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:09,361
Enough!
The good times are over

27
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:11,690
You'll learn your lesson!

28
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:16,393
What are you sitting here for?
Go work, or I fuck your mutter!

29

Byelorussia, 1 943

30
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:50,592
Go on, dig! Without any guns,
they won't let us join

31
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:32,639
Nothing around here

32
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:37,483
And where have I got mine?
I didn't buy it in a store

33
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:41,314
It's not for me you're digging.
I'm ready to go!

34
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:45,415
Hello? Is this Berlin?

35
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:53,854
So, you did it? Your pants are full,
right?

36
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:27,450
What did I tell you?

37
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:11,797
COME AND SEE

Oh, sonny…

48
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:55,263
Oh, sonny…

49
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:01,644
How will you explain it to your
dad when he returns?

50
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:06,915
He will come back
and find nobody here

51
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:13,589
Have pity on yourself

52
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,593
lf you can't have any pity for me,
then have pity for them

53
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:23,630
For the love of God…

54
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,372
Have you no heart?

55
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:35,678
Stop talking like that, mom.
They're all going, I can't stay here

56
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:50,225
What are you doing?

57
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:53,790
Then kill all of us, right now.
Why wait?

58
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:58,893
Go on, kill them!
Kill all of us!

59
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:32,865
You're not going anywhere!
You're not going!

60
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:03,961
Mother!

61
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:18,441
Hello there.
Or should I say good morning?

62
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:23,849
Right. Your weapon, where is it?

63
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:28,452
- Where's your weapon?
- It's right here

64
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:45,939
And who are these two?
Twins?

65
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:48,243
That's right, twins

66
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:51,439
Out of the same litter

67
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:57,283
The sun's nearly up

68
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,627
Shall we go?

69
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:05,459
Not yet.
When they put the cows out

70
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:07,899
We want a crowd to watch

71
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:11,465
Take these, sonny.
They will make you warm

72
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:13,468
With us, he'll stay warm

73
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:17,698
Don't you worry,
we'll see that he's alright.

74
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,475
He'll be like in a pioneer camp

75
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:25,439
Buttermilk…  Take what you like

76
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,368
Got something stronger?
Milk with a little kick?

77
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,333
lf I'd known you wanted to drink…

78
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:52,466
We never do.
Only on holidays

79
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:55,008
And at funerals

80
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:02,880
We maintain discipline. Our commander
is a career officer

81
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,353
Kossatch! That's the man, alright

82
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:11,326
You come too close, he'll make you go
away. You go away, he'll get you

83
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,962
- Remember Bobok?
- What Bobok?

84
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:16,700
The one who was half deaf

85
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:22,768
He wanted to sleep on guard duty.
Kossatch didn't bother to wake him up

86
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:23,909
Enough of that!

87
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:26,675
Woke up or didn't, it doesn't matter

88
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:39,858
Makes you laugh, eh?

89
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:50,293
Women here like to sleep late.
Why are you standing? Sit down!

90
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:55,372
We don't have time to sit here.
lf they catch us, that'll be the end

91
00:12:57,543 --> 00:13:01,411
One day I was sitting so good
that now I never sit down

92
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:06,448
Know what I mean, mother?
A shrapnel, as big as a fist!

93
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:10,685
You may laugh,
but it was right here

94
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:12,255
What's the matter with those cows?

95
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:14,686
A couple of rounds in the air
would wake them

96
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:19,259
Women! Get 'em out!

97
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,330
Alright, let's go!

98
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:26,336
Why are you taking him away?

99
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:28,338
Get a good breath of air

100
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:31,905
Milked or not, get 'em out!

101
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:34,809
Where are you taking him?

102
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:41,217
He's a good boy,
he hurts nobody!

103
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:43,582
He's always polite!

104
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:47,283
Good people! Who could throw
a stone at such a boy?!

105
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:52,287
- What are you doing?
- Keep your hands off!

106
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:01,872
Come, say goodbye to your brother.

107
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:04,668
Here, hold the bird.
And don't move!

108
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:22,393
Out of the way!

109
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:25,958
Out of the way!

110
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,199
Look.

111
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:33,263
It's Yustin, mayor of the village.
Idiot!

112
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,565
I don't understand.

113
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:42,645
My little Fliora! My son!

114
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:51,984
My son!

115
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:13,869
Hello, everybody!

116
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:49,407
Hello

117
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:52,441
Just keep going, lad, keep going

118
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,711
Why rip it off with the skin?

119
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:04,526
What are you doing?
I'm still alive!

120
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:15,373
Nurse, water…

121
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:22,175
Hello

122
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:28,320
Go on, move!

123
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:36,223
- Hello.
- Hello

124
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:44,532
Who is the last one?

125
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,972
Don't sit in the Major's chair!

126
00:16:57,549 --> 00:16:58,948
All of you, shut up!

127
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:11,220
Close up a little!
And you, look forward!

128
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:16,867
What's that? You call it your face?
Look at your comrade's face!

129
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:21,662
Ah, what a suit!
Over here

130
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,535
You'll lie down right here

131
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:29,809
Like that.
Don't take your suit off yet

132
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,653
Hey, you cow!

133
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:39,757
WE,D RATHER EAT YOU
THAN LET THE ENEMY GET YOU

134
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:42,958
Make room for the cow!

135
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:47,390
Hurry up, Perekhod! We ain't got
all day!

136
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:52,400
I've got only one sheet of film.
This is the last one, so hold it

137
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,670
Our father is here!

138
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:02,710
Quiet down! I'm ready

139
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:06,510
Look at this man. He put on
a new suit and he stays still

140
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:09,581
Let's make a trade.
I took it from a live guy

141
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:14,588
Ah, our Chief. Welcome, Comrade

142
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:26,929
Will you give us a picture?

143
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:32,667
Rise up, our country wide and great

144
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:37,545
Rise up for a deadly fight

145
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:43,751
With fascists daring to invade

146
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:48,554
With black hordes of the night

147
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:54,957
Let our noble wrath swell on

148
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:59,560
Like a big and surging wave

149
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:05,640
The people's war is going on

150
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:10,273
Our sacred war of faith

151
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:31,426
Who is there?

152
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:35,740
Password

153
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:39,502
Password!

154
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:53,558
- Are you new?
- Yeah

155
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:56,888
- Your name?
- Gaishoun. Third squad

156
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,559
- Why didn't you shoot?
- I recognized you, Comrade Commander

157
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:06,393
Whenever a man doesn't stop or say
the password, shoot!

158
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:07,705
Yes, only…

159
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:11,570
No excuses.
Extra duty as a punishment

160
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:14,772
Thanks

161
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,730
- Where is he?
- Who? Password!

162
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,427
- Where'd he go?
- Password, I said!

163
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:54,746
That damned owl again!

164
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:00,325
Go to sleep. Your watch is up

165
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:08,558
… in the immediate proximity
of the enemy…

166
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:11,396
are fulfilling their duty day and
night…

167
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:18,401
And today I got two notes

168
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:21,838
Very cryptically drawn

169
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:27,971
Every line contained just dots

170
00:22:28,313 --> 00:22:31,282
For me to guess it on my own

171
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:37,586
How am I to find
What is on his mind…

172
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:46,354
Ivan, come here!

173
00:22:53,638 --> 00:22:58,666
I'm going to tell you the truth.
This will be a hard time for us

174
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:04,614
Old partisans know only too well
what a siege means

175
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:08,615
It means Hitler's “all-out war”

176
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:11,946
His objective is to exterminate
all of us

177
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:16,891
Our duty is to defend to the end
every territory

178
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:21,230
that the High Command
has put into our hands

179
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:25,631
But the situation is complicated

180
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,830
and it's going to change every
moment

181
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:31,198
So we must be vigilant

182
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:36,238
You have a weapon in your hands
and a head on your shoulders

183
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:39,717
Or, as our Commander says

184
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:44,219
to live and never say What the heck,,
is not my way

185
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:49,222
I've said it before, I'll say it
again：

186
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:54,388
A partisan never asks how many
fascists are there?

187
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:58,498
No. He asks,  “Where are the fascists?”

188
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:04,666
Well, right now, they are here,
on our soil.

189
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:11,946
Every one of you
helps decide

190
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:16,683
how long this war will last

191
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:20,755
We won't have any cowards here

192
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:25,394
Not one of you is going to be
a coward

193
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:29,962
Their main weapon is fear

194
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:37,971
They want to make slaves of you,
just bugs, to crush you down

195
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:44,908
They're the ones who are going
to be scared of us! No mercy to them!

196
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:47,842
They don't deserve any

197
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:52,479
We'll all be asked one day
what we did here

198
00:24:55,327 --> 00:25:00,355
Any wounded or sick?
Any who can't march alone?

199
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:03,529
There's nothing to be ashamed of

200
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:08,228
We have to organize a reserve
station in any case

201
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:11,869
- No wounded or sick!
- No one playing tricks!

202
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:17,741
You see, my boots are no good at all

203
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,946
Swap boots with the new one.
He's staying behind

204
00:25:29,227 --> 00:25:34,756
All sections, by fours, fall in
and follow me, forward march!

205
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,392
Move it! Move it!

206
00:25:39,004 --> 00:25:43,566
You heard the commander?
Come on, sit down

207
00:25:56,254 --> 00:25:59,587
Let's go, men!
Don't fall behind!

208
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,967
What's your name?

209
00:28:58,303 --> 00:28:59,270
Fliora

210
00:28:59,437 --> 00:29:00,461
And your first name?

211
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:05,268
That's it, Fliora. Florian.
And yours?

212
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:11,479
Rose. Rose of the kolkhoze!
Ever hear that one?

213
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,848
Tell me, how did you get here?

214
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:18,519
They deported me to Germany.
But here I am!

215
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,521
They rescued you? Kossatch did?

216
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:27,355
I want to ask you, Rose, you were
all dressed up over there. Why?

217
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:33,531
Where was that?

218
00:29:34,405 --> 00:29:40,537
This morning, in front of the men.
I couldn't get it, Rose, really

219
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:56,818
My name is Glasha. Glafira

220
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:00,696
You understand now, idiot?

221
00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:05,700
- What's wrong?
- And what's wrong with you? Fliora!

222
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:10,899
Just exactly what are you doing
here?

223
00:30:13,244 --> 00:30:16,771
What, they took pity on the little
one, leaving you here?

224
00:30:18,616 --> 00:30:20,516
Kossatch took pity on you?

225
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:22,586
Pity?

226
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:24,585
Yes, pity!

227
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:27,424
They'll be lucky if I take pity
on them!

228
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:32,661
He can pity, yes, he can

229
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:38,299
Only it makes him cry in his sleep

230
00:30:38,469 --> 00:30:40,437
Kossatch? Cries in his sleep?

231
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:45,740
He won't last long.
I'm telling you that

232
00:30:46,544 --> 00:30:50,241
You're lying! Filthy liar!

233
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:55,943
Liar!

234
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:20,971
Why don't you say something?

235
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:27,712
Why won't you see me?

236
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:31,788
I'm right here…

237
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:36,657
I exist…

238
00:31:39,764 --> 00:31:40,992
Here I am

239
00:31:43,701 --> 00:31:49,435
You're not living.
You don't hear birds singing

240
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:55,672
You're deaf and blind

241
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:03,376
Here I am…  here…

242
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:09,556
I want to love

243
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:15,627
I want to have children…
Do you hear?

244
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:24,337
I can do anything for you, anything!

245
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:30,209
Do you want me to get blown up?

246
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:33,584
Don't do that

247
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:50,928
You idiot! Idiot! Idiot!

248
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:57,798
I'm carrying 60 ammunition rounds,
a grenade, an automatic rifle

249
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:02,379
I'm here to fight,
and you treat me like an imbecile

250
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:05,449
Kossatch! I'm not Kossatch!

251
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:07,309
Are you crazy or what?

252
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:15,751
What are you doing?

253
00:33:18,363 --> 00:33:19,455
What's got into you?

254
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:28,195
Fliora, Fliora,
little silly Fliora!

255
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:32,901
Did I shock you, boy?

256
00:33:33,244 --> 00:33:34,211
Not again!

257
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:36,907
Don't be angry

258
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:40,708
Are you starting again?

259
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:45,648
What's that?

260
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:50,657
It must be the beavers howling.
I guess, I broke their dam

261
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:56,232
Everybody's howling today

262
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:04,675
Look

263
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:11,181
That's the one that's always flying

264
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:16,246
- Want me to shoot it down?
- Hey, don't! Give it back!

265
00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:34,571
One…

266
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,635
Two, three…

267
00:36:21,412 --> 00:36:22,436
Glasha…

268
00:36:27,785 --> 00:36:28,809
Glasha

269
00:37:03,454 --> 00:37:05,217
Come on, hurry! Hurry!

270
00:38:56,233 --> 00:38:58,701
Glasha

271
00:39:42,646 --> 00:39:44,671
Tomorrow, Mom is going to be
real happy

272
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:50,381
I'll hide all of us

273
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:53,551
I know where

274
00:39:57,995 --> 00:39:59,963
You'll see my funny sisters

275
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:06,698
Then we'll find Kossatch's
detachment

276
00:44:35,939 --> 00:44:36,963
Wait a minute

277
00:44:53,957 --> 00:44:54,924
Mom!

278
00:45:21,919 --> 00:45:24,251
They're not here. It's alright.
Sit down

279
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:02,418
They're gone

280
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:10,929
Still warm. That's great

281
00:46:25,716 --> 00:46:28,446
Eat. Mom made it

282
00:48:39,983 --> 00:48:42,383
I know where they are. Let's go

283
00:48:44,721 --> 00:48:45,688
What an idiot!

284
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:51,327
Let's go!

285
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:54,564
That's where they all are

286
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:24,724
Come on, let's go!

287
00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:28,297
It's right down here. Let's run!

288
00:49:51,221 --> 00:49:52,552
They're here!

289
00:49:55,592 --> 00:50:00,256
They've gone to the island!
They're here!

290
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:20,917
Glasha!

291
00:52:38,688 --> 00:52:43,216
They're back there, not here!

292
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:47,421
No, they're not here!
They're dead!

293
00:52:48,031 --> 00:52:52,934
They were all killed!
All of them! Dead!

294
00:52:54,404 --> 00:52:57,430
They're not! They're here!

295
00:53:12,722 --> 00:53:13,882
Glasha!

296
00:54:27,497 --> 00:54:29,829
His family have all been killed!

297
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:33,266
He's led me into the bogs!

298
00:54:33,503 --> 00:54:37,405
He's deaf!
He's crazy!

299
00:54:38,308 --> 00:54:41,709
He's gone mad! He can't hear!

300
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:46,213
He's taking me to the bogs!

301
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:05,800
His whole family have been killed!

302
00:55:45,442 --> 00:55:49,469
Fliora, my dear child!
They killed your mother and sisters!

303
00:56:45,668 --> 00:56:50,264
Didn't I tell you…

304
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:55,473
Didn't I tell you not to dig…

305
00:56:59,015 --> 00:57:02,644
Dead to the last one…

306
00:57:04,687 --> 00:57:08,589
To the very last one…

307
00:57:12,629 --> 00:57:15,154
Poured gasoline over me…

308
00:57:16,833 --> 00:57:17,891
I burned…

309
00:57:21,638 --> 00:57:25,665
I ran…  I caught up with them…

310
00:57:28,578 --> 00:57:31,877
I begged them…

311
00:57:34,417 --> 00:57:36,885
to kill me…

312
00:57:38,655 --> 00:57:43,820
They just laughed…

313
00:57:46,429 --> 00:57:51,264
Didn't I tell you not to dig?

314
00:58:46,656 --> 00:58:48,248
Fliora!

315
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:17,580
Alright?

316
01:00:17,747 --> 01:00:20,910
Why do you give him a nose?
He got syphilis

317
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:23,582
- Yes, and only one arm.
- And no balls

318
01:00:23,753 --> 01:00:27,519
Yeah, his dong was already ripped off
in the last war

319
01:00:28,558 --> 01:00:30,788
lf you capture him,
what would you do to him?

320
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:33,220
We once caught a horse thief

321
01:00:33,396 --> 01:00:36,593
And our men put him bare-ass
on an ant hill!

322
01:00:37,533 --> 01:00:41,731
Even better, his bare ass on a red-hot
skillet that ain't been greased!

323
01:00:42,338 --> 01:00:44,806
Ask the women
what to do with him

324
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:53,471
Shall I stick the ears on?

325
01:00:53,783 --> 01:00:57,879
Go ahead, let him hear all
we say about him

326
01:01:01,424 --> 01:01:03,517
You got very soft hair

327
01:01:03,693 --> 01:01:05,888
Soft like a baby's hair

328
01:01:49,972 --> 01:01:53,237
Now he's ready.
Isn't that right?

329
01:01:53,409 --> 01:01:54,740
Cover him with shit!

330
01:01:54,911 --> 01:01:57,311
Where am I going to get it,
with everybody going hungry?

331
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:00,176
- At least rip out his tongue.
- Put warts on him!

332
01:02:00,349 --> 01:02:03,876
I've made five of them already

333
01:02:04,787 --> 01:02:07,688
- Have you finished, guys?
- That's it. He's ready

334
01:02:07,857 --> 01:02:10,189
This one's not going to do any more
shouting! Let's go!

335
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:13,320
Bastard! Son of a whore!

336
01:02:31,447 --> 01:02:33,278
We'll bring it back. Don't worry

337
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:36,912
When we come back, it'll be yours

338
01:02:37,386 --> 01:02:41,413
Why are you making a sick guy
of him? He's pretty strong

339
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:44,591
You can go along, if you want.
To hunt, the wolf walks on his paws

340
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:49,357
I know where there's a nice little
warehouse. Come on!

341
01:02:50,032 --> 01:02:53,229
Dear sons,
you won't abandon us?

342
01:02:53,402 --> 01:02:56,496
What do you think we are,
degenerates?

343
01:02:57,473 --> 01:03:01,375
What do you want us to bring you?
You order just like at the canteen

344
01:03:01,577 --> 01:03:04,546
- Bread!
- Salt!

345
01:03:05,248 --> 01:03:08,240
- Milk, please!
- Potatoes!

346
01:03:08,518 --> 01:03:11,954
Get us some bread,
that'd be a hell of a good thing

347
01:03:14,357 --> 01:03:17,758
You never knew it would end up
like this. You couldn't know

348
01:03:19,662 --> 01:03:21,562
Fliora, look at me

349
01:03:23,666 --> 01:03:25,634
Go on, tell him that we'll be waiting

350
01:03:26,002 --> 01:03:29,699
No. It's all my fault

351
01:03:53,362 --> 01:03:57,696
Big, round and bright.

352
01:03:59,101 --> 01:04:02,195
They can see us a mile away
on a night like this.

353
01:04:04,574 --> 01:04:06,269
Hey, you frog, stop your croaking!

354
01:04:06,442 --> 01:04:10,208
Go on, you runners! You're not
snuggling in a woman's tits tonight.

355
01:04:11,581 --> 01:04:14,482
Carry me, if you're so smart!

356
01:05:48,144 --> 01:05:52,103
Well? Was that your big warehouse
attack?

357
01:05:53,616 --> 01:05:57,177
Oh, my legs!
Why don't you carry my ass?

358
01:05:57,353 --> 01:05:59,253
How could I know they'd be here?

359
01:06:02,558 --> 01:06:05,686
Went for a booty,
came back robbed.

360
01:06:06,729 --> 01:06:09,254
It serves you right, you good-for-
nothings!

361
01:06:09,432 --> 01:06:11,832
You got your mouths watering!
A warehouse!

362
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:15,464
Why the hell did you drag that psycho
along?

363
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:18,835
The Germans were right behind us.
They tried to take him away.

364
01:06:20,443 --> 01:06:22,707
If it hadn't been for him,
we wouldn't all be here.

365
01:06:22,878 --> 01:06:25,847
You'd be back in Bobruisk,
in your kerosene shop.

366
01:06:26,182 --> 01:06:28,548
Gleb would be
in his Leningrad swamp.

367
01:06:28,751 --> 01:06:33,848
You know, back home in Slutsk, we had
a guy who made vodka out of soap.

368
01:06:34,256 --> 01:06:35,780
What are you always laughing at?

369
01:06:36,525 --> 01:06:40,859
They asked a guy with a hump:
"How come your back's all round?''

370
01:06:41,197 --> 01:06:43,290
He says: “That's 'cause my chest
caves in!''

371
01:06:43,466 --> 01:06:46,731
- You're a hopeless optimist.
- He should be cured of that.

372
01:06:46,902 --> 01:06:49,803
As for crying, there's already enough
crying in the world.

373
01:07:27,243 --> 01:07:30,542
So she says, “If I’d known all that,
I’d never have given birth to you.''

374
01:07:31,147 --> 01:07:32,239
Charge it!

375
01:07:32,815 --> 01:07:34,646
This guy ain't going to holler
no more!

376
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:38,217
Come on, hurry!

377
01:07:38,821 --> 01:07:44,157
Don't tickle me, or my fart
is going to flatten Europe!

378
01:07:44,326 --> 01:07:47,295
The devil is not so black
as his SS shits.

379
01:07:48,397 --> 01:07:50,228
I’d like to watch that!

380
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:51,423
Right. Let's go.

381
01:08:19,295 --> 01:08:22,321
If you're so generous,
why don't you drop tobacco!

382
01:08:36,245 --> 01:08:38,270
"Kill the Bolshevik kikes.

383
01:08:38,447 --> 01:08:41,075
Smash a brick in their ugly mugs.''

384
01:08:43,452 --> 01:08:44,680
That's all?

385
01:08:48,324 --> 01:08:49,655
Sent planes to deliver just that?

386
01:08:55,264 --> 01:08:56,356
Hey, Jews!

387
01:08:58,134 --> 01:09:00,568
Stand up! March on!

388
01:09:05,207 --> 01:09:07,732
Well? Shall we try one more time?

389
01:09:09,345 --> 01:09:13,304
Or like Roubej says, “Stay right on
my heels as trouble won't be far''.

390
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:17,119
Do we go?

391
01:09:19,288 --> 01:09:21,620
Maybe we'll wait till night?

392
01:09:22,791 --> 01:09:26,386
Back there, people are starving,
and we're doing nothing.

393
01:09:35,738 --> 01:09:39,697
Go on! Move! The Germans are
in a hurry! Don't slow 'em down!

394
01:09:42,311 --> 01:09:43,608
Damn!

395
01:09:44,747 --> 01:09:46,271
Let's go! Come on!

396
01:09:48,384 --> 01:09:49,351
Where you going?

397
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:33,517
There you are. We haven't seen
you for a while.

398
01:11:34,356 --> 01:11:35,687
How can we manage without you?

399
01:11:36,425 --> 01:11:39,690
The only reason you fly over us
is to drop your little gifts.

400
01:11:41,096 --> 01:11:44,259
How about a motorcycle
with a side-car?

401
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:46,397
Haven't ridden in one
for a long time!

402
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:49,037
Get down!

403
01:12:07,056 --> 01:12:10,423
They get drunk up there,
and we return the empties!

404
01:13:27,703 --> 01:13:30,672
Hold it, dad.
You'll finish it later.

405
01:13:32,541 --> 01:13:35,806
Who is it? Who's there?

406
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:39,677
- Quiet! Are you in the police?
- And who are you, guys?

407
01:13:40,215 --> 01:13:44,242
Button up, you'll catch cold.
Is this village Kamenka?

408
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:47,514
No, no. This is Bagoushovka.

409
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:51,188
The Germans have been here
two days already.

410
01:13:52,361 --> 01:13:54,329
- Is the cow-shed locked?
- No.

411
01:13:54,496 --> 01:13:58,455
You're going to lead us out, along
with the cow. Got that, dad?

412
01:13:58,801 --> 01:14:02,259
And don't try any tricks.
You'll get us out and run back.

413
01:14:03,238 --> 01:14:05,832
Be quick about it. Just be natural.

414
01:14:06,175 --> 01:14:09,076
Yes, alright. If I have to, I have to.

415
01:14:09,244 --> 01:14:11,269
I like men with common sense.
Fliora, are you awake?

416
01:14:12,748 --> 01:14:15,717
Your doors squeak.
Better grease 'em.

417
01:14:18,821 --> 01:14:22,484
How come the Germans didn't kill
the dogs? It's not right.

418
01:14:24,393 --> 01:14:27,419
You're white and your cow, too.
What'll we cover you with?

419
01:14:27,596 --> 01:14:30,224
- I’ll get something in the house.
- A rifle, maybe?

420
01:14:30,399 --> 01:14:34,495
That's a trick you can pull on my
neighbor. His name's “Idiot''.

421
01:14:35,671 --> 01:14:37,502
There's horse manure.
Roll in it.

422
01:14:42,411 --> 01:14:44,436
What's your rank in the police?

423
01:14:45,314 --> 01:14:49,182
No, I’m not in the police!
It's the defensive brigade.

424
01:14:50,285 --> 01:14:55,188
Let's go now, and quick! Wouldn't
want your wife start missing you.

425
01:14:59,728 --> 01:15:01,059
Go on!

426
01:15:07,870 --> 01:15:09,838
Don't turn around, or you'll fall.

427
01:15:20,749 --> 01:15:22,080
Crouch down.

428
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:27,721
Now you go back.

429
01:15:32,194 --> 01:15:34,424
Back home. Got it?

430
01:15:35,464 --> 01:15:37,432
And keep your mouth shut.
You tell nobody.

431
01:15:38,667 --> 01:15:42,228
Get going! Run!

432
01:15:43,772 --> 01:15:45,569
Or your old lady'll bawl you out!

433
01:16:17,172 --> 01:16:18,696
I wonder what our dad's doing now?

434
01:16:18,874 --> 01:16:21,604
He took a little walk
to do his business.

435
01:16:21,810 --> 01:16:24,836
He had a nice pair of boots on.
Box-calf leather.

436
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:29,775
Maybe he's looking for us,
wants to trade his boots for mine?

437
01:16:32,387 --> 01:16:35,356
Nice cow, good one, stay here.

438
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:38,726
Hold still!

439
01:16:41,196 --> 01:16:43,562
Hold still, my dear.

440
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:46,727
Go on, milk her!

441
01:17:01,283 --> 01:17:04,116
We'll get drunk, you and me.
That's the good life!

442
01:18:03,779 --> 01:18:06,577
Uncle Roubej!

443
01:24:24,392 --> 01:24:27,293
Ho, giddup! Giddup, ho!

444
01:24:33,535 --> 01:24:37,869
Hey, what are you doing?
What are you doing, comrade?

445
01:24:38,206 --> 01:24:40,299
I got no time to waste talking
with you!

446
01:24:40,909 --> 01:24:44,367
You got a hatchet? There's meat.
A cow's been killed there!

447
01:24:44,546 --> 01:24:47,879
Hey, wait! It's my horse
you're taking!

448
01:24:50,785 --> 01:24:53,686
There're kids, a lot of people
starving to death!

449
01:24:53,855 --> 01:24:54,822
And us, ain't we people, too?

450
01:24:55,156 --> 01:24:59,388
People are fighting,
and you stay nice and warm inside.

451
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:08,200
Look what they did!

452
01:25:14,442 --> 01:25:15,466
See what they did?

453
01:25:15,643 --> 01:25:17,838
Easy, boy, take it easy.

454
01:25:40,768 --> 01:25:42,736
You crazy or what?

455
01:25:43,271 --> 01:25:46,172
Put it all in there.

456
01:25:49,344 --> 01:25:53,303
The belt, the jacket...
Hide it in there.

457
01:25:55,416 --> 01:25:56,508
Go on, hurry!

458
01:26:16,804 --> 01:26:18,396
Oh, such a thing!

459
01:26:18,573 --> 01:26:21,201
- What village is that?
- Perekhody.

460
01:26:21,376 --> 01:26:25,710
- We got two families with that name.
- You'll be a Perekhod, too. Got it?

461
01:26:27,448 --> 01:26:31,407
We had one like you who got drowned.
You'll be him.

462
01:26:31,586 --> 01:26:32,553
What was his name?

463
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:37,419
You got a mother, you got sisters
and brothers.

464
01:26:38,193 --> 01:26:43,096
Olga, Katka, Fedia, and little Sonia.
You remember it all.

465
01:26:44,599 --> 01:26:48,296
Your mother's name is Fiokla Perekhod.

466
01:26:48,603 --> 01:26:51,367
And your name is Zhenka.
You got it?

467
01:26:52,407 --> 01:26:53,567
Let's get out of here.

468
01:28:05,246 --> 01:28:08,807
This morning, I insulted
a German soldier.

469
01:28:19,227 --> 01:28:20,717
And where's my father?

470
01:28:21,062 --> 01:28:24,463
- Say he's gone.
- Gone where?

471
01:28:24,732 --> 01:28:28,691
Where? Hell! What does it matter?
Come with me.

472
01:28:28,870 --> 01:28:32,397
Say you're Mitrophane,
my grandson. You got it?

473
01:29:54,756 --> 01:29:59,216
This is my family.
Aksinya Perekhod, my daughter-in-law...

474
01:30:01,262 --> 01:30:03,355
my sister and her children.

475
01:30:03,531 --> 01:30:06,432
- And who's that?
- My son-in-law. He's an accountant.

476
01:30:08,336 --> 01:30:12,033
Those are my sister's children,
Lima, Raya,

477
01:30:12,206 --> 01:30:15,801
Zoika, Vika, Veronica,
and little Boris.

478
01:30:16,711 --> 01:30:19,441
Get down!
Search the houses!

479
01:30:23,484 --> 01:30:25,111
We came to see you...

480
01:30:25,286 --> 01:30:32,192
These are our neighbors, Maria and
her kids, Lucia, Frosia, Fenya, Ivan.

481
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:36,121
We know what they want. They'll
take some and deport them to Germany.

482
01:30:36,297 --> 01:30:38,265
Who are they going to take? You?

483
01:30:39,434 --> 01:30:42,403
Come in. Everything's fine.

484
01:30:45,506 --> 01:30:47,599
You go and look on the roof.

485
01:31:02,824 --> 01:31:04,519
Quiet... quiet.

486
01:31:16,537 --> 01:31:17,765
Do you speak German?

487
01:31:19,774 --> 01:31:23,175
Me? Yes. Do you speak it, too?

488
01:31:24,278 --> 01:31:26,007
Do you speak German, too?

489
01:31:32,153 --> 01:31:33,347
Sit down.

490
01:31:43,364 --> 01:31:44,592
Please, eat.

491
01:31:53,508 --> 01:31:54,736
You take all you want, Sir.

492
01:31:57,678 --> 01:31:59,202
What have you got here?

493
01:32:04,519 --> 01:32:06,214
Oh, partisan!

494
01:32:18,833 --> 01:32:22,166
They put up resistance not far from
here.

495
01:32:40,555 --> 01:32:46,391
Why are you drinking alone?
Pour some for me, too.

496
01:32:47,862 --> 01:32:49,454
Please, schnapps.

497
01:32:52,033 --> 01:32:55,127
Inhabitants of the village of
Perekhody!

498
01:32:56,304 --> 01:32:59,398
Inhabitants of the village of
Perekhody!

499
01:33:00,374 --> 01:33:07,143
Everybody in the village!
Listen attentively!

500
01:33:07,582 --> 01:33:12,076
You all take children
and your papers.

501
01:33:12,253 --> 01:33:16,349
Go to the village square.

502
01:33:17,191 --> 01:33:22,219
We look at papers of all families
and lists...

503
01:33:24,699 --> 01:33:29,659
...and how German Army authorities'
orders are being followed.

504
01:33:30,471 --> 01:33:33,804
You must have all documents

505
01:33:34,208 --> 01:33:38,804
proving delivery of
agriculture products.

506
01:33:43,150 --> 01:33:46,813
No one is to stay in house,
in barn,

507
01:33:47,154 --> 01:33:50,681
in cellar, on roof or in attic...

508
01:34:07,108 --> 01:34:12,068
Wait! Where are you running?
They're going to slaughter you!

509
01:34:14,315 --> 01:34:18,411
What are you staring at?
Look down, bastard!

510
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:20,844
I’m going to kill him!

511
01:34:26,427 --> 01:34:31,296
Take something to eat
for two days.

512
01:34:31,465 --> 01:34:33,296
Bring all children...

513
01:34:45,913 --> 01:34:49,576
...Maintain order and discipline...

514
01:35:15,509 --> 01:35:21,414
Germany is... civilized country.

515
01:35:22,183 --> 01:35:25,482
Everyone who goes to Germany

516
01:35:25,653 --> 01:35:29,612
must have a toothbrush,

517
01:35:30,191 --> 01:35:34,150
toothpaste, shoe-polish, soap,

518
01:35:34,328 --> 01:35:37,422
a towel for every member of a family.

519
01:35:37,598 --> 01:35:42,501
To take fruits and vegetables
is forbidden

520
01:35:42,670 --> 01:35:46,731
in order not to infect Europe.

521
01:36:02,857 --> 01:36:06,054
l, the officer of
sanitary inspection,

522
01:36:06,360 --> 01:36:16,531
ascertain that the cause of death
was seven bullets

523
01:36:16,737 --> 01:36:21,197
that got stuck
in the upper thorax.

524
01:36:21,575 --> 01:36:27,343
Anyone who won't follow
the orders of the German Army

525
01:36:27,515 --> 01:36:32,350
will meet the same
miserable fate.

526
01:36:35,656 --> 01:36:38,216
Herr Major, everything is fine!

527
01:36:40,127 --> 01:36:42,152
Sturmbanfuhrer, everything's ready.

528
01:36:42,329 --> 01:36:44,797
Do we invite them in?
Will there be any signal?

529
01:37:02,216 --> 01:37:04,741
Damn it! Bugger those bastards!

530
01:37:11,158 --> 01:37:15,060
Welcome, my dear friends!

531
01:39:11,712 --> 01:39:14,180
We caught a yid!

532
01:39:17,084 --> 01:39:20,576
This kike bastard wasn't smart enough
not to get caught!

533
01:39:25,559 --> 01:39:27,254
Dirty Jew!

534
01:39:33,500 --> 01:39:35,058
Grab him!

535
01:39:51,185 --> 01:39:57,090
Let me out! What are you doing,
bastards? I’m one of you!

536
01:40:13,607 --> 01:40:15,165
Quiet!

537
01:40:16,543 --> 01:40:19,740
Now, we're starting our village
meeting.

538
01:40:21,281 --> 01:40:24,250
If anybody got anything to say,
go ahead and sign in!

539
01:40:42,169 --> 01:40:43,636
What are they doing there?

540
01:41:24,845 --> 01:41:26,369
Quiet down!

541
01:41:32,286 --> 01:41:35,050
Get out without children.

542
01:41:37,091 --> 01:41:40,117
Right here, out of the window.

543
01:41:42,229 --> 01:41:43,821
Leave the children.

544
01:41:46,467 --> 01:41:47,627
Come on, move it!

545
01:42:03,183 --> 01:42:05,708
Beasts!

546
01:42:57,104 --> 01:42:58,571
Come on, get out.

547
01:43:22,262 --> 01:43:27,290
Have you heard that he's taken up
command of a division?

548
01:43:27,467 --> 01:43:29,731
That's great! Don't you think so?

549
01:43:36,710 --> 01:43:38,041
Let go!

550
01:43:43,784 --> 01:43:45,684
What a picture!

551
01:43:48,088 --> 01:43:49,180
I’ll kill you!

552
01:44:49,082 --> 01:44:50,242
To the right.

553
01:45:30,590 --> 01:45:33,616
Look! Empty! Empty!

554
01:45:35,395 --> 01:45:41,356
Ah, piss-ass clerks, that's what
you are! The intelligentsia!

555
01:45:47,541 --> 01:45:50,237
More gasoline.
Let it soak through.

556
01:50:52,178 --> 01:50:54,476
Get up! Lead the cows!

557
01:50:55,682 --> 01:50:59,277
You! March!
Go! Faster!

558
01:51:02,689 --> 01:51:05,089
Faster, you bastard!

559
01:53:06,579 --> 01:53:10,015
Petro, want some honey?

560
01:54:42,275 --> 01:54:46,371
We'll leave you here, grandma...
to reproduce!

561
01:54:46,546 --> 01:54:49,242
You make all of us some children.

562
01:59:23,356 --> 01:59:28,191
To love... to have children...

563
02:01:00,186 --> 02:01:01,653
Out of the way!

564
02:01:02,455 --> 02:01:04,719
Move! Out of the way!

565
02:01:11,063 --> 02:01:12,360
Wait!

566
02:01:13,833 --> 02:01:15,164
Are you all crazy?!

567
02:01:16,269 --> 02:01:24,506
You want to just kill them?
Just like that?

568
02:01:24,710 --> 02:01:28,806
They're all SS! Punitive detachment!
They lit the fire. We're not Germans!

569
02:01:29,215 --> 02:01:30,443
Sit down!

570
02:01:30,616 --> 02:01:32,049
They made us do everything.

571
02:01:34,854 --> 02:01:39,052
Bastards! I lost my children
in that burning hell!

572
02:01:49,368 --> 02:01:52,997
Rank and unit?

573
02:01:56,309 --> 02:02:00,211
Walter Stein, SD Major.
15th Einsatzkommando.

574
02:02:00,813 --> 02:02:03,475
That's the fuhrer.
He gave all the orders.

575
02:02:12,325 --> 02:02:14,623
He's an old, sick man.

576
02:02:19,465 --> 02:02:21,729
He never did any harm to anyone.

577
02:02:27,139 --> 02:02:28,731
He is,

578
02:02:29,075 --> 02:02:33,102
like his father was,
a man of principle.

579
02:02:38,784 --> 02:02:43,585
He... he never harbored
any hatred of your people.

580
02:02:55,301 --> 02:03:00,000
He's never killed anyone,
he wouldn't kill a fly.

581
02:03:04,810 --> 02:03:08,644
Everyone here can confirm that,
and he hopes they will.

582
02:03:18,190 --> 02:03:22,650
He's just a tired, old man.
"I want to quit.''

583
02:03:25,531 --> 02:03:27,021
That's what he's saying.

584
02:03:33,139 --> 02:03:38,167
He wants to take care of his grand-
children. He's got grandkids like you.

585
02:03:44,350 --> 02:03:48,684
But this is war time, and it's
nobody's fault, this German says.

586
02:03:49,221 --> 02:03:51,712
Swine! Dog!

587
02:03:54,860 --> 02:03:56,691
A typical German!

588
02:03:57,797 --> 02:04:00,823
Bastard! Shit!

589
02:04:02,368 --> 02:04:04,199
He's the one...

590
02:04:05,738 --> 02:04:11,199
He's the one who said: “Leave
the children.

591
02:04:13,579 --> 02:04:17,709
You can come out,
but not the children''.

592
02:04:20,186 --> 02:04:23,417
He's a fascist! Executioner!

593
02:04:25,257 --> 02:04:32,163
Yes, I said that: “Come out
and leave the children''.

594
02:04:34,600 --> 02:04:35,862
Translate it.

595
02:04:43,342 --> 02:04:46,311
I said that because with the children
it starts all over again.

596
02:04:49,348 --> 02:04:51,111
You've got no right to be.

597
02:04:54,220 --> 02:04:58,247
Not every race
has a right to exist.

598
02:04:58,791 --> 02:05:00,520
Listen!

599
02:05:02,161 --> 02:05:03,753
Everyone, listen!

600
02:05:15,174 --> 02:05:17,836
Inferior races
spread the contagion of communism.

601
02:05:20,179 --> 02:05:21,544
You have no right to be.

602
02:05:26,318 --> 02:05:28,286
And our mission will be accomplished.

603
02:05:30,523 --> 02:05:32,081
If not today, tomorrow.

604
02:05:51,143 --> 02:05:54,112
It isn't me. He's the one who said it!

605
02:05:54,647 --> 02:05:59,516
We're not Germans!
We're not Germans!

606
02:06:00,085 --> 02:06:02,178
We won't do it again!
Forgive us!

607
02:06:02,354 --> 02:06:05,687
We're not Germans!

608
02:06:07,860 --> 02:06:12,524
Not Germans! You've forgotten
what these dogs did?!

609
02:06:12,865 --> 02:06:20,203
They're degenerates! They should be
killed! But we're not Germans...

610
02:06:21,173 --> 02:06:23,141
Then who are you, you filthy slime?

611
02:06:23,309 --> 02:06:25,277
They made us do it!

612
02:06:25,444 --> 02:06:28,538
We're not Germans!
We're not Germans!

613
02:06:30,249 --> 02:06:36,552
Death to the fascist bastards!
Make them pay! Kill them!

614
02:06:39,592 --> 02:06:46,088
You'll do that yourself.
And you'll pay like the Germans.

615
02:06:56,208 --> 02:06:58,676
Give it to me! Give it!

616
02:06:59,478 --> 02:07:01,503
I’m one of you!

617
02:07:03,716 --> 02:07:05,377
Brothers, I’m one of you!

618
02:07:15,628 --> 02:07:19,826
Comrade, let's light it!
Comrade, let me have a torch!

619
02:07:20,165 --> 02:07:21,189
Out of the way!

620
02:09:08,607 --> 02:09:09,801
The new one!

621
02:09:35,367 --> 02:09:37,232
Come on, we're going!

622
02:13:51,656 --> 02:13:54,523
626 VILLAGES IN BYELORUSSIA

623
02:13:54,726 --> 02:13:58,526
WERE BURNT TO THE GROUND
WITH ALL THEIR INHABITANTS

624
02:15:06,264 --> 02:15:08,255
Move it! Let's go!

625
02:16:33,251 --> 02:16:35,412
THE END
