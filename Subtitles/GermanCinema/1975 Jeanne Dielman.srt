<i>Hello.</i>

3
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:11,920
See you next week, then.

4
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:52,036
No reading at the table.

5
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:40,264
Is it good?

6
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:03,120
I added less water than last week.
Maybe that's why it's better.

7
00:21:28,538 --> 00:21:31,792
You hardly eat.
You don't look well, you know.

8
00:22:25,178 --> 00:22:27,764
Want something else?
Some fruit?

9
00:24:00,774 --> 00:24:03,777
We got a letter
from Aunt Fernanda in Canada.

10
00:24:44,192 --> 00:24:45,902
I'll read it to you.

11
00:25:02,335 --> 00:25:04,588
“Dear Jeanne and Sylvain,

12
00:25:04,713 --> 00:25:08,175
I'm sorry I've taken
so long to write back.

13
00:25:08,341 --> 00:25:11,011
I often think of you and Belgium.

14
00:25:11,178 --> 00:25:15,348
But I've been so busy
with the kids starting back to school,

15
00:25:15,515 --> 00:25:18,685
and suddenly
I realized winter's here.

16
00:25:18,852 --> 00:25:22,314
It's been snowing a lot,
and I hardly get out.

17
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:26,902
The roads were so bad that the kids
couldn't go to school last Friday,

18
00:25:27,027 --> 00:25:29,696
and I'm at home most of the time,

19
00:25:29,863 --> 00:25:33,074
because without a car,
you get bogged down.

20
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,244
Jack says he'll teach me
to drive next year.

21
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:39,456
The distances
are simply too huge here.

22
00:25:39,581 --> 00:25:43,877
He says I'm in Canada now
and I should act like the locals.

23
00:25:44,044 --> 00:25:47,547
The women here all drive,
but I'm afraid I'll never learn.

24
00:25:47,672 --> 00:25:51,218
But now all the cars
are completely covered by snow.

25
00:25:51,343 --> 00:25:53,553
The children are fine,
big and strong.

26
00:25:53,678 --> 00:25:55,639
Real Canadians, just like Jack.

27
00:25:55,764 --> 00:25:59,726
I fear Jane may get too tall,
but anyway, she's fine.

28
00:25:59,893 --> 00:26:02,145
I hope you'll come
see them this summer.

29
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:06,233
We have a large guest room,
and Sylvain can sleep with his cousin.

30
00:26:06,358 --> 00:26:08,610
Maybe we can
introduce you to someone.

31
00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:10,737
Jack says you should remarry,

32
00:26:10,862 --> 00:26:13,615
that a good-looking woman
shouldn't be alone.

33
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:16,409
George has been dead
six years now.

34
00:26:16,534 --> 00:26:20,455
We know you're very brave
and you say you'd rather stay single

35
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,916
so as not to complain.

36
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:26,086
But sometimes when I think of you,
tears come to my eyes.

37
00:26:26,253 --> 00:26:29,756
Well, Jack will be home soon
and the table's not set yet,

38
00:26:29,923 --> 00:26:32,509
so I'll say good-bye,
with a hug for you both.

39
00:26:32,634 --> 00:26:35,053
Your loving sister and aunt,
Fernande.

40
00:26:35,178 --> 00:26:40,558
PS: I sent a birthday present
for Jeanne last month by boat.”

41
00:27:02,122 --> 00:27:04,958
I wonder
what that present could be.

42
00:27:07,127 --> 00:27:09,296
Would you like to go to Canada?

43
00:27:22,183 --> 00:27:25,103
“The Enemy,”
by Charles Baudelaire.

44
00:27:26,146 --> 00:27:29,983
“My youth was but
a gloomy storm

45
00:27:30,317 --> 00:27:33,987
With occasional flashes
of dazzling sun

46
00:27:34,487 --> 00:27:37,866
Thunder and rain
have created such havoc

47
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:42,662
That in my garden
few buds remain

48
00:27:43,788 --> 00:27:47,125
Now I've reached
the autumn of my thoughts

49
00:27:47,334 --> 00:27:49,794
And I have to use...”

50
00:27:50,086 --> 00:27:51,671
The spade.

51
00:27:51,838 --> 00:27:55,675
“And I have to use
the spade and rake

52
00:27:55,842 --> 00:27:59,596
To reclaim a bit
of the flooded land

53
00:28:01,056 --> 00:28:04,684
Where water burrows pits
like open graves.”

54
00:28:04,851 --> 00:28:06,519
Once more.

55
00:28:06,728 --> 00:28:09,689
“The Enemy,”
by Charles Baudelaire.

56
00:28:11,024 --> 00:28:14,152
“My youth was but
a gloomy storm

57
00:28:14,361 --> 00:28:17,906
With occasional flashes
of dazzling suns

58
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:23,578
Thunder and rain
have created such havoc

59
00:28:23,745 --> 00:28:26,873
That in my garden

60
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,751
Now I've reached
the autumn of my thoughts

61
00:28:29,876 --> 00:28:33,004

62

00:28:36,091 --> 00:28:38,885
Where water burrows pits

64
00:28:41,888 --> 00:28:44,391
You're picking up the accent
more and more.

65
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:48,019
I know. I can even pronounce
the Rs like Yan,

66
00:28:48,144 --> 00:28:50,980
and no one laughs at me
at school anymore.

67
00:28:51,106 --> 00:28:52,732
Perhaps...

68
00:28:52,899 --> 00:28:56,194
but nobody forced you to go
to the Flemish school.

69
00:28:56,694 --> 00:28:58,863
Yes, I know - your friend.

70
00:29:17,048 --> 00:29:20,760
I wonder if you can still
say your Rs like me.

71
00:30:15,231 --> 00:30:18,443
<i>And now, the Bagatelle
for Piano No. 27,</i>

72
00:30:18,568 --> 00:30:21,488
<i>Opus 126 in A Minor,
by Beethoven,</i>

73
00:30:21,613 --> 00:30:25,450
<i>“Für Elise,”
played by Suzanne Duchêne.</i>

74
00:31:43,778 --> 00:31:45,822
Come have a look.

75
00:31:57,208 --> 00:31:59,711
You want it long, don't you?

76
00:32:19,772 --> 00:32:21,941
I'm almost out of yarn.

77
00:33:37,809 --> 00:33:40,311
- This is Tuesday, isn't it?
- Yes.

78
00:39:46,552 --> 00:39:49,638
You're always reading,
just like your father.

79
00:39:49,764 --> 00:39:52,349
I know.
You already told me.

80
00:39:52,641 --> 00:39:55,436
How did you meet my father?

81
00:39:55,895 --> 00:39:58,105
Why do you ask that now?

82
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:00,399
I just read the word “miracle,”

83
00:40:00,566 --> 00:40:04,570
and Aunt Fernande always said
it was a miracle she met Jack.

84
00:40:04,695 --> 00:40:08,282
Yes, he came in '44
to liberate us.

85
00:40:08,407 --> 00:40:11,118
They tossed chewing gum
and chocolates to us,

86
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:13,829
and we threw flowers to them.

87
00:40:13,996 --> 00:40:17,083
I met your father
after the Americans had left.

88
00:40:17,249 --> 00:40:20,628
I was living with my aunts,
because my parents were dead.

89
00:40:20,753 --> 00:40:24,882
One Saturday, I went to
the Bois de la Cambre with a girlfriend.

90
00:40:25,091 --> 00:40:27,259
I don't remember the weather.

91
00:40:27,384 --> 00:40:32,264
She knew him. You know who I mean.
I've shown you her picture.

92
00:40:33,099 --> 00:40:34,850
So we began seeing each other.

93
00:40:34,975 --> 00:40:38,521
I was working as a billing clerk
for horrible pay.

94
00:40:38,646 --> 00:40:42,399
Life with my aunts was dull.
I didn't feel like getting married,

95
00:40:42,525 --> 00:40:47,279
but it seemed to be
“the thing to do,” as they say.

96
00:40:47,446 --> 00:40:50,616
My aunts kept saying,
“He's nice. He has money.

97
00:40:50,783 --> 00:40:52,785
He'll make you happy.”

98
00:40:52,993 --> 00:40:55,121
But I still couldn't decide.

99
00:40:55,412 --> 00:41:00,584
But I really wanted
a life of my own, and a child.

100
00:41:01,293 --> 00:41:06,048
Then his business suddenly
hit the rocks, so I married him.

101
00:41:06,715 --> 00:41:09,301
Things like that happened
after the war.

102
00:41:09,802 --> 00:41:11,971
My aunts had changed
their minds.

103
00:41:12,096 --> 00:41:14,974
They said a pretty girl like me
could do better

104
00:41:15,099 --> 00:41:18,227
and find a man
who'd give me a good life.

105
00:41:18,352 --> 00:41:22,481
They said he was ugly and so on,
but I didn't listen.

106
00:41:23,691 --> 00:41:27,319
If he was ugly, did you want
to make love with him?

107
00:41:28,279 --> 00:41:32,283
Ugly or not,
it wasn't all that important.

108
00:41:32,408 --> 00:41:35,744
Besides, “making love,”
as you call it, is merely a detail.

109
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:39,165
And I had you.
And he wasn't as ugly as all that.

110
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:41,625
Would you want to remarry?

111
00:41:42,126 --> 00:41:44,795
No. Get used to someone else?

112
00:41:45,379 --> 00:41:47,631
I mean someone you love.

113
00:41:48,966 --> 00:41:50,843
Oh, you know...

114
00:41:51,552 --> 00:41:54,305
Well, if I were a woman,

115
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:58,601
I could never make love with someone
I wasn't deeply in love with.

116
00:41:58,726 --> 00:42:01,896
How could you know?
You're not a woman.

117
00:42:02,188 --> 00:42:03,898
Lights out?

118
00:42:04,148 --> 00:42:05,858
All right.

119
00:42:06,192 --> 00:42:07,651
Sleep well.

120
00:43:05,334 --> 00:43:08,420
end of the first day

121
00:55:03,969 --> 00:55:05,929
Did you wash your hands?

122
00:56:07,782 --> 00:56:10,618
Couldn't I have
a little more today?

123
01:09:15,986 --> 01:09:18,155
Thank you, ma'am.

124
01:09:43,889 --> 01:09:46,183
How are you, ma'am?

125
01:09:46,308 --> 01:09:50,563
Fine, thanks.
Could you fix these by tomorrow?

126
01:09:50,688 --> 01:09:52,773
My son's wearing his other pair,

127
01:09:52,898 --> 01:09:55,526
but his feet get soaked
when it rains.

128
01:09:55,693 --> 01:09:58,028
They're last year's shoes.

129
01:09:58,696 --> 01:10:00,865
I'll have a look.

130
01:10:04,869 --> 01:10:07,288
And the heels too,
while I'm at it.

131
01:10:07,413 --> 01:10:10,332
All right.
How's tomorrow at 4:00?

132
01:10:10,457 --> 01:10:11,709
Fine.

133
01:10:11,876 --> 01:10:14,795
- How's your boy doing?
- Just fine.

134
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:18,340
You're happy with him?
He listens to you?

135
01:10:18,465 --> 01:10:19,675
Good.

136
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:21,802
What would I do without him?

137
01:10:21,927 --> 01:10:24,138
They'll be ready tomorrow at 4:00.

138
01:11:17,149 --> 01:11:19,652
Hello.
It's been a long time.

139
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:22,112
Stop by for coffee
this afternoon.

140
01:11:22,279 --> 01:11:25,699
I can't today.
Maybe next week.

141
01:11:25,824 --> 01:11:28,410
All right. See you then.

142
01:18:22,783 --> 01:18:24,659
Hello.

143
01:23:31,174 --> 01:23:32,175
Here he is.

144
01:23:32,342 --> 01:23:34,552
<i>You weren't eating,
were you?</i>

145
01:23:34,803 --> 01:23:36,805
<i>What are you making for dinner?</i>

146
01:23:36,930 --> 01:23:40,350
Wednesdays it's breaded veal
with peas and carrots.

147
01:23:40,850 --> 01:23:43,186
<i>I had no idea
what to make today.</i>

148
01:23:43,353 --> 01:23:47,691
<i>Myself, I'd be fine
with just bread and butter.</i>

149
01:23:48,441 --> 01:23:51,778
<i>I don't have much appetite
ever since I started smoking.</i>

150
01:23:51,903 --> 01:23:56,366
<i>But the children need meat,
so I went to the butcher's.</i>

151
01:23:56,533 --> 01:23:58,868
<i>There was a long line.</i>

152
01:23:59,536 --> 01:24:04,666
<i>I always think I should go
earlier or later to avoid the line,</i>

153
01:24:04,791 --> 01:24:07,210
<i>but this time, I thought...</i>

154
01:24:07,335 --> 01:24:10,839
<i>“I'll listen to what other women order.
I might get some ideas.”</i>

155
01:24:10,964 --> 01:24:13,216
<i>But I got
even more discouraged.</i>

156
01:24:14,008 --> 01:24:16,678
<i>One ordered ground meat.</i>

157
01:24:16,803 --> 01:24:19,889
<i>I thought,
"Probably for meat loaf,</i>

158
01:24:20,056 --> 01:24:23,184
<i>but I just served that yesterday
with apple sauce.</i>

159
01:24:23,309 --> 01:24:26,980
<i>Then I though:
"No, she 'll make hash.”</i>

160
01:24:27,230 --> 01:24:28,940
<i>But hash again...</i>

161
01:24:29,065 --> 01:24:34,028
<i>When my turn came,
I still hadn't decided.</i>

162
01:24:34,571 --> 01:24:38,742
<i>So I ordered the same thing
as the woman in front of me</i>

163
01:24:38,908 --> 01:24:42,704
<i>and wound up paying 300 francs
for two pounds of veal.</i>

164
01:24:43,413 --> 01:24:47,917
<i>It's a good two days' worth,
and none of us really like veal.</i>

165
01:24:48,084 --> 01:24:50,420
<i>So the kids turn up
their noses once again.</i>

166
01:24:50,545 --> 01:24:53,047
<i>People say veal
has no vitamins.</i>

167
01:24:53,173 --> 01:24:56,926
<i>And you can't eat fish these days -
it can kill you.</i>

168
01:24:57,969 --> 01:25:00,972
<i>If only they didn't come home
for lunch every day,</i>

169
01:25:01,097 --> 01:25:03,975
<i>but my husband says
the food at school isn't good,</i>

170
01:25:04,100 --> 01:25:06,936
<i>and they're small
for their age as it is.</i>

171
01:25:07,061 --> 01:25:10,356
<i>I tell you,
if it were up to just me...</i>

172
01:25:12,150 --> 01:25:15,278
<i>But he 'll be gone
all next week.</i>

173
01:25:15,445 --> 01:25:17,530
<i>I'll miss him, you know?</i>

174
01:25:17,655 --> 01:25:20,033
<i>I'll stay at my mother's,</i>

175
01:25:20,158 --> 01:25:23,995
<i>so they'll have to get used
to eating with the other kids.</i>

176
01:25:24,120 --> 01:25:25,747
<i>It's better that way.</i>

177
01:25:25,872 --> 01:25:27,957
<i>My husband can't object.</i>

178
01:25:28,374 --> 01:25:30,752
<i>Does your son
eat lunch at school?</i>

179
01:25:30,877 --> 01:25:33,171
Yes, he always has.
He's not fussy.

180
01:25:33,296 --> 01:25:35,215
My husband wasn't either.

181
01:25:35,340 --> 01:25:38,301
<i>Oh, mine isn't either.
It's all those kids.</i>

182
01:25:38,551 --> 01:25:41,471
<i>But what can you do, you know?</i>

183
01:25:43,264 --> 01:25:45,475
<i>At least there are ways
these days.</i>

184
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:47,352
<i>Well, I've gotta go.</i>

185
01:25:47,769 --> 01:25:49,312
<i>Bye.</i>

186
01:29:26,195 --> 01:29:27,572
Excuse me.

187
01:29:28,865 --> 01:29:32,535
I'd like a ball of yarn this color.

188
01:29:34,537 --> 01:29:37,331
I think I saw some over there.

189
01:29:40,043 --> 01:29:42,211
- This color?
- Yes.

190
01:29:53,347 --> 01:29:54,891
Yes, that's it.

191
01:33:33,067 --> 01:33:34,777
Good-bye, ma'am.

192
01:35:39,902 --> 01:35:41,445
<i>Hello.</i>

193
01:37:10,075 --> 01:37:11,827
See you next Thursday.

194
01:42:35,108 --> 01:42:37,486
A bag of potatoes, please.

195
01:42:45,118 --> 01:42:46,620
Here you are.

196
01:42:47,162 --> 01:42:48,664
Thank you.

197
01:48:36,094 --> 01:48:37,679
Mother?

198
01:48:44,853 --> 01:48:46,605
Your hair's a mess.

199
01:48:46,730 --> 01:48:49,274
I let the potatoes cook too long.

200
01:49:54,881 --> 01:49:56,883
No reading at the table.

201
01:51:39,110 --> 01:51:41,196
We'll have to wait a bit.

202
01:51:42,030 --> 01:51:45,575
The meat and vegetables
were on a very low flame.

203
01:52:30,078 --> 01:52:32,414
Just another minute or two.

204
01:52:45,760 --> 01:52:49,347
I could have made mashed potatoes,
but we're having that tomorrow.

205
01:53:32,515 --> 01:53:36,144
You must be hungry.
You had swimming this morning.

206
01:53:37,562 --> 01:53:39,814
I didn't go.
Neither did Yan.

207
01:53:39,981 --> 01:53:41,608
Why?

208
01:53:41,900 --> 01:53:44,319
Yan skipped it
just to keep me company.

209
01:53:44,444 --> 01:53:48,239
I said I had a headache,
and we stayed in the nurse's office.

210
01:53:48,364 --> 01:53:50,742
We had to pass
our certification today.

211
01:53:50,867 --> 01:53:53,286
I don't like you doing that.

212
01:54:11,179 --> 01:54:13,765
I should write back
to Aunt Fernande.

213
01:54:14,057 --> 01:54:16,684
The potatoes
should be done now.

214
01:57:25,957 --> 01:57:28,876
Aren't we going to listen
to the radio tonight?

215
01:57:29,043 --> 01:57:30,545
Yes.

216
01:58:44,410 --> 01:58:47,705
Is something wrong?
The radio, perhaps?

217
01:58:47,955 --> 01:58:49,957
Yes, it could be that singer.

218
01:58:50,082 --> 01:58:54,337
No, I just don't know
how to reply to their invitation.

219
02:01:09,388 --> 02:01:12,516
Can we not go tonight?
We ate so late.

220
02:01:12,808 --> 02:01:14,602
We're going.

221
02:03:31,781 --> 02:03:36,118
Come home early tomorrow if you like,
and bring Yan along for a snack.

222
02:03:37,078 --> 02:03:39,663
I think Yan's in love
with the nurse.

223
02:03:39,789 --> 02:03:43,375
He didn't catch the streetcar.
Said he had things to do.

224
02:03:43,501 --> 02:03:47,880
But when I passed by later,
he hadn't left.

225
02:03:49,006 --> 02:03:51,967
He bought a book
that explains lots of things

226
02:03:52,093 --> 02:03:54,470
about climaxes and orgasms.

227
02:03:54,595 --> 02:03:57,681
He says we should be interested
in women at our age,

228
02:03:57,807 --> 02:04:00,142
but he doesn't want
some young girl.

229
02:04:00,309 --> 02:04:02,770
He says a man's penis
is like a sword.

230
02:04:02,895 --> 02:04:05,606
The deeper you thrust it in,
the better.

231
02:04:05,731 --> 02:04:07,983
But I thought, “A sword hurts.”

232
02:04:08,109 --> 02:04:11,320
He said,
“True, but it's like fire.”

233
02:04:11,487 --> 02:04:13,823
But then where's the pleasure?

234
02:04:13,948 --> 02:04:16,200
There's no point
talking about these things.

235
02:04:16,325 --> 02:04:19,829
He's the one who told me
everything when I was 10.

236
02:04:19,954 --> 02:04:23,124
I said, “What?
Dad does that to Mom?”

237
02:04:23,249 --> 02:04:27,753
I hated Dad for months after that,
and I wanted to die.

238
02:04:27,878 --> 02:04:31,132
When he died, I thought
it was punishment from God.

239
02:04:31,257 --> 02:04:33,801
Now I don't even believe
in God anymore.

240
02:04:33,926 --> 02:04:36,887
Yan also said
it wasn't just to make babies.

241
02:04:37,012 --> 02:04:41,517
So I started having nightmares
so you'd stay with me at night

242
02:04:41,684 --> 02:04:45,271
and Dad wouldn't have a chance
to thrust inside you.

243
02:04:45,396 --> 02:04:47,356
You shouldn't have worried.

244
02:04:47,565 --> 02:04:50,067
It's late.
I'm turning out the light.

245
02:04:50,526 --> 02:04:51,819
All right.

246
02:04:53,070 --> 02:04:54,321
Mom?

247
02:04:54,446 --> 02:04:57,491
It's late, Sylvain.
Sleep well.

248
02:05:51,086 --> 02:05:54,089
End of the second day

249
02:13:14,696 --> 02:13:16,948
Did you wash your hands?

250
02:13:24,539 --> 02:13:26,208
Your button.

251
02:14:59,342 --> 02:15:00,886
Sylvain!

252
02:22:29,209 --> 02:22:31,461
- All sold out?
- Is it empty?

253
02:23:50,373 --> 02:23:52,417
A small loaf, ma'am?

254
02:23:52,875 --> 02:23:55,128
Do you have a bag?

255
02:24:07,473 --> 02:24:09,017
You have a bag?

256
02:24:09,142 --> 02:24:11,019
Give me a new one.

257
02:24:18,359 --> 02:24:20,695
That's 10 francs 50.

258
02:24:35,293 --> 02:24:36,919
Thanks.

259
02:24:37,045 --> 02:24:38,713
Good-bye.

260
02:52:49,360 --> 02:52:54,115
What a beautiful little boy!

261
02:54:46,519 --> 02:54:50,106
What's this all about?

262
02:57:23,259 --> 02:57:25,678
<i>Thanks. Good-bye.</i>

263
02:58:58,646 --> 02:59:00,272
Oh, miss?

264
02:59:03,234 --> 02:59:04,777
Yes, ma'am.

265
02:59:05,069 --> 02:59:08,948
Would you happen to have
a button like this?

266
02:59:09,240 --> 02:59:12,118
I've looked,
but I couldn't find any.

267
02:59:13,702 --> 02:59:17,957
- Maybe these?
- No, they're a bit too small.

268
02:59:21,544 --> 02:59:23,254
Good-bye.

269
02:59:42,648 --> 02:59:45,401
I know it's hard
to match it perfectly,

270
02:59:45,526 --> 02:59:48,571
because my sister Fernande
sent it from Canada.

271
02:59:48,779 --> 02:59:53,075
She sent it years ago,
but Sylvain's only wearing it now

272
02:59:53,200 --> 02:59:55,411
because it was too large.

273
02:59:55,828 --> 02:59:57,621
When Sylvain was six,

274
02:59:57,746 --> 03:00:00,749
my sister came back
to Belgium for three months.

275
03:00:00,875 --> 03:00:04,295
He slept in our room -
my husband was still alive.

276
03:00:05,796 --> 03:00:10,843
And Fernande slept on the couch
with Jonathan - “Jon” for short.

277
03:00:11,302 --> 03:00:15,097
Jon was five, but he was taller
and stouter than Sylvain.

278
03:00:15,222 --> 03:00:18,225
So if I write her for one,

279
03:00:18,476 --> 03:00:21,353
it's quite possible
that this style no longer exists.

280
03:00:21,479 --> 03:00:25,191
Since people always say Europe
is five years behind America,

281
03:00:25,357 --> 03:00:27,276
I thought I might find one.

282
03:00:27,401 --> 03:00:29,695
It's practically impossible
to find the same thing.

283
03:00:29,862 --> 03:00:31,864
Better just to change
all the buttons.

284
03:00:32,031 --> 03:00:34,658
It makes a garment look new.

285
03:00:34,867 --> 03:00:37,203
Like going to the hairdresser's.

286
03:01:00,184 --> 03:01:02,978
I've never seen buttons like that.

287
03:01:04,230 --> 03:01:07,858
Try in the square.
You might find some there.

288
03:02:09,628 --> 03:02:11,338
Isn't Gisèle here today?

289
03:02:11,463 --> 03:02:13,465
She gets off work at 4:00.

290
03:02:13,591 --> 03:02:15,968
I see. Coffee, please.

291
03:03:01,639 --> 03:03:03,182
Here you are.
