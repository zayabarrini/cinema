1
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:24,019
THE TIN DRUM

2
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:50,509
<i>I'll begin long before
I ever existed.</i>

3
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:55,871
<i>When the time came
for my poor mama to be born,</i>

4
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:59,109
<i>my grandmother, Anna Bronski,</i>

5
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,879
<i>who was still young
and unsuspecting,</i>

6
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:06,856
<i>sat in her four skirts
at the edge of a potato field.</i>

7
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:10,189
<i>That was in 1899,</i>

8
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:12,763
<i>in the heart of Kashubia.</i>

9
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:17,867
<i>Something moved at the horizon.
(Stop! Stop, I say!)</i>

10
00:02:17,302 --> 00:02:19,819
<i>Something jumped there.</i>

11
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,686
Please.

12
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:25,535
Anybody come this way?

13
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,297
Name of Koljaiczek?

14
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:31,307
- A firebug.
- Short with broad shoulders.

15
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:34,969
I saw him.
Running like a bat out of hell.

16
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:36,479
Which way?

17
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,055
I don't believe it.

18
00:03:56,336 --> 00:04:00,830
- He's gone.
- Must be in Bissau if he's not here.

19
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:03,771
Has to be one or the other.
There's nowhere else.

20
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:08,002
And it's raining, besides.

21
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,363
All right, Koljaiczek.

22
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:03,900
My name is Joseph.

23
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:43,842
<i>Joseph and Anna
hid with the raftsmen</i>

24
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,706
<i>for almost a year.</i>

25
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:51,680
<i>That's how long
it took the police to catch up</i>

26
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,149
<i>with my grandfather.</i>

27
00:05:57,423 --> 00:05:58,412
Run!

28
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,560
Don't shoot!

29
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:14,765
- Don't shoot him!
- Fire at will!

30
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:28,045
<i>After that dive,</i>

31
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:31,088
<i>Koljaiczek was never seen again.</i>

32
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:35,054
<i>Some say he drowned.</i>

33
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:37,894
<i>Others say</i>

34
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,691
<i>he escaped to America,</i>

35
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:43,893
<i>where, in Chicago,
under the name of Joe Colchic,</i>

36
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,935
<i>he became a millionaire.</i>

37
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:51,104
<i>They say he made his pile in lumber,</i>

38
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:54,110
<i>in matches,</i>

39
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:59,017
<i>and in fire insurance.</i>

40
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:14,098
<i>As for my grandmother,</i>

41
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:18,499
<i>she sat year after year
in her four skirts,</i>

42
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:21,265
<i>hawking her wares in the market.</i>

43
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,402
Geese!

44
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:28,479
Not too fat and not too lean.

45
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:30,479
<i>And she grew older.</i>

46
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:34,009
<i>The First World War came,</i>

47
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:35,984
<i>and instead of geese,</i>

48
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:38,450
<i>she had only turnips to sell.</i>

49
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:54,137
Turnips!

50
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:58,038
<i>My poor mother grew older too.</i>

51
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:02,443
<i>She was worried about her cousin Jan.</i>

52
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:09,144
<i>Jan had been called to war,
but he wanted to be near her.</i>

53
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,256
- Name?
- Bronski, Jan.

54
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:14,188
- Year?
- 1898.

55
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:16,355
Cough.

56
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:18,257
Again.

57
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:22,360
Rejected.

58
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,104
"No ass, no neck
To the army I'm a wreck!"

59
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:37,745
<i>For the first time, my mother
held her cousin Jan in her arms,</i>

60
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:39,612
<i>and I doubt</i>

61
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:43,778
<i>if they ever embraced more happily.</i>

62
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:50,922
<i>This young war love
remained untarnished,</i>

63
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,299
<i>until Alfred Matzerath came along.</i>

64
00:08:53,508 --> 00:08:58,012
<i>He was a born Rhinelander
and in the hospital Silberhammer,</i>

65
00:08:58,221 --> 00:09:01,767
<i>the darling of the nurses,
in his Rhinelandish cheerful way.</i>

66
00:09:01,773 --> 00:09:04,629
Sister Agnes, is there too much paprika?
Or does it need more clove?

67
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:05,975
What did she say?

68
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:10,339
She said you're a born cook,
Mr. Matzerath.

69
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:13,007
You know how to turn
feelings into soup.

70
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,801
<i>The war had spent itself.</i>

71
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:38,171
<i>Danzig was declared a Free State.</i>

72
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:41,677
<i>The Poles were given
their own post office,</i>

73
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:45,374
<i>where stamp collector
Jan Bronski went to work.</i>

74
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:48,042
<i>Alfred Matzerath
also stayed in Danzig.</i>

75
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:55,454
We Kashubians
have always been here.

76
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:57,289
Long before the Poles,

77
00:09:57,463 --> 00:10:00,125
and, naturally,
long before the Germans.

78
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:02,859
That's old news, Jan.
Now we've got peace.

79
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:04,935
Germans, Poles, Kashubians -

80
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,935
we'll all live together in peace.

81
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,141
I don't know.

82
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:15,308
Well, you'll see.

83
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:27,948
<i>The two men, so different despite
their similar feelings for Mama,</i>

84
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:31,585
<i>liked each other,</i>

85
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:35,700
<i>and from that trinity
they brought me, Oskar,</i>

86
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:37,460
<i>into the world.</i>

87
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:43,272
<i>The sun was in the sign of Virgo.</i>

88
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:47,606
<i>Neptune moved
into the tenth house of middle life,</i>

89
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:51,409
<i>anchoring Oskar somewhere
between wonder and disillusion.</i>

90
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:24,415
Push, push.

91
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:31,689
<i>Push, Agnes, push!
Push hard!</i>

92
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:39,654
It's coming!

93
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:47,137
<i>I first saw the light of this world
in the form of a 60-watt bulb.</i>

94
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:50,639
Alfred, it's a boy!

95
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:02,944
I knew it would be a boy,

96
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:05,818
even if I sometimes said
it would be a girl.

97
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:11,822
Not so hot.

98
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,032
Let's see how much he weighs.

99
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:24,001
When he's big,
he'll take over the business.

100
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:27,771
Now we know what we're slaving for.

101
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,978
When little Oskar is three years old,

102
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,641
he shall have a tin drum.

103
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:39,719
<i>Only the prospect
of the tin drum prevented me</i>

104
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:43,521
<i>from expressing
more forcefully my desire</i>

105
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:46,026
<i>to return to the womb.</i>

106
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:49,199
<i>Besides, my umbilical cord
had been cut.</i>

107
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:51,595
<i>There was nothing more to be done.</i>

108
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:07,543
<i>And so it was that I could
hardly wait till my third birthday.</i>

109
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:12,751
<i>Who married us
Go on, tell them</i>

110
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:16,017
<i>You tell them
It was the cardinal</i>

111
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:20,732
<i>The cardinal bird married us</i>

112
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,696
<i>The cardinal bird married us</i>

113
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:29,838
<i>The blue sky was our cathedral</i>

114
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,378
What is it?

115
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:46,353
Oh, it's little Oskar.

116
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:49,153
Want some more cake?
- No, thank you.

117
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:51,726
Your mouth's filthy.

118
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:55,056
- Another sip, Grandma?
- Oh, yes.

119
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,850
It's not like an apple
that you give away.

120
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,318
We must learn to respect
the human body again.

121
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:19,480
And with rolls at three pfennigs -

122
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:20,923
What do you want?

123
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:23,857
The main thing is a stable currency.

124
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,590
And plenty to drink!

125
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:29,666
So here's to the stable mark

126
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:31,826
and the three-pfennig roll!

127
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:37,533
To youth!

128
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,802
And beauty!

129
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:41,205
<i>Beautiful indeed is youth</i>

130
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,143
May I call you by your first name?

131
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,218
Then I'll call you Lina.

132
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:50,985
We won't be so young
when next we meet!

133
00:14:53,792 --> 00:15:00,220
<i>The gentle nightingale
sang her song all night</i>

134
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:05,200
<i>Love, oh, love</i>

135
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:08,963
<i>Is a power</i>

136
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:12,507
<i>Divine</i>

137
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:16,708
<i>The gentle nightingale</i>

138
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:20,113
<i>Sang her song all night</i>

139
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:25,082
<i>Love, oh, love</i>

140
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,551
How lovely.

141
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,617
Jan, get the cards.

142
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:58,980
I'll just drop this in the laundry

143
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:01,750
and rinse a few glasses.

144
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:10,024
September 12,

145
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:14,406
1927.

146
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:16,404
Next year, you'll be this big,

147
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:19,043
and then this big,
and then this big,

148
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:20,769
and then as big as me.

149
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:22,277
Gangway!

150
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,875
Fresh from the cellar.
- Here are the glasses.

151
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:29,413
So you won't have to drink
from the bottle.

152
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:38,862
- Playing, Mr. Scheffler?
- Heavens, no.

153
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:41,727
Go ahead. I'll just watch.

154
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,629
Besides, it's my bedtime.

155
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:47,670
- He's always tired.
- You shouldn't have married a baker.

156
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,118
Oskar, it's been a long time since
Grandma let anyone under her skirts.

157
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:06,484
Let's have a little game!

158
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,697
Let's see where those jacks are.

159
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,983
Hey, cousin, you're out of diamonds!

160
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:36,621
Don't argue. Play.

161
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:46,492
I have two diamonds myself.

162
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:48,189
How would I know?

163
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,895
<i>That day,</i>

164
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,200
<i>reflecting on the grown-up world</i>

165
00:17:56,375 --> 00:18:00,436
<i>and my own future,</i>

166
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:03,080
<i>I decided to call a halt -</i>

167
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:07,014
<i>to stop growing then and there</i>

168
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:09,620
<i>and remain a three-year-old,</i>

169
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:12,621
<i>a gnome, once and for all.</i>

170
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:52,397
One, two, three...

171
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:51,986
My God, there he is.

172
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:54,489
What happened?

173
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:57,561
He fell down the stairs!

174
00:19:57,729 --> 00:19:59,060
Do something!

175
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:04,432
Why was the cellar door open?

176
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:05,934
He's bleeding.

177
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:09,596
Alfred, it's your fault!
You left the cellar door open!

178
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:12,710
I was just getting beer for everyone.

179
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:20,114
Run and get the doctor.

180
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:25,547
- It looks bad.
- You! It's your fault!

181
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,453
You left the cellar door open!

182
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:29,958
Stop! Stop!

183
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:42,603
Calm down!
What's done is done!

184
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:46,108
My little Oskar.

185
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:49,206
My little boy.

186
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:51,945
How could this have happened?

187
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:04,318
Two weeks in bed
and Oskar will be as good as new.

188
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:10,765
Just a slight concussion.

189
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,369
Plenty of cold compresses.

190
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:16,337
<i>My fall was a complete success.</i>

191
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:19,875
<i>The family story was:
On his third birthday,</i>

192
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:23,481
<i>our little Oskar
fell down the cellar stairs.</i>

193
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:27,312
<i>He didn't break any bones,
but he never grew again after that,</i>

194
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:29,317
<i>not a fraction of an inch.</i>

195
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:35,685
That drum again.
It's so loud.

196
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:44,564
There's my little Oskar,
all well again.

197
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,738
Have a good lunch.

198
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:58,272
Not in the house, I said.

199
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:00,610
Besides, it's broken.
You'll hurt yourself.

200
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:03,550
You staying? We're having mushrooms.
- Sorry. Post office time.

201
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:05,417
Let me have that.

202
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,558
If you hurt yourself,
it will be my fault again.

203
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,288
See? I told you so.

204
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,828
Give me that drum
and I'll give you some chocolate.

205
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:21,964
Let them have it.
I'll get you a new one.

206
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,630
No! Oskar don't want!

207
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:25,606
We'll see about that.

208
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:28,940
Alfred, why must you always use force?

209
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:31,844
My drum!

210
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:53,568
<i>And thus I discovered
my voice was capable of a scream</i>

211
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:56,469
<i>so high-pitched</i>

212
00:22:56,641 --> 00:23:01,305
<i>that no one dared
take my drum away.</i>

213
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:04,314
Shards bring luck.

214
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:09,147
<i>Because when my drum was
taken away, I screamed,</i>

215
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:13,815
<i>and when I screamed,
valuable articles burst into bits.</i>

216
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:18,455
<i>Is the black cook here today</i>

217
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:20,665
<i>No, no, no</i>

218
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:23,928
<i>She will make an evil brew</i>

219
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:27,200
<i>She will put you in her stew</i>

220
00:23:27,472 --> 00:23:29,997
<i>Then she will devour you</i>

221
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:32,802
<i>Look, there she is</i>

222
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:42,952
That's enough of that!

223
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:45,214
Beat it, you freak!
I'm coming down!

224
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:14,579
<i>But no one dares to argue</i>

225
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:20,117
<i>O glorious call of the sun</i>

226
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:30,098
<i>Green of birch and green of seed</i>

227
00:24:30,268 --> 00:24:33,101
<i>As if with gestures to plead</i>

228
00:24:33,438 --> 00:24:36,737
<i>Old Mother Earth has decreed</i>

229
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:41,644
<i>Mankind her own shall be</i>

230
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,644
I'll take that one.

231
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:47,415
Look...

232
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:51,750
if you please,
at this extraordinary potato.

233
00:24:51,923 --> 00:24:56,019
This tumescent, luxuriant flesh,

234
00:24:56,194 --> 00:24:59,254
forever conceiving new shapes...

235
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:01,729
and yet so chaste.

236
00:25:02,934 --> 00:25:04,424
I love the potato

237
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:06,468
because it speaks to me.

238
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:12,235
Yes, spuds are bigger
this year than last.

239
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:13,900
What are you doing?

240
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:17,445
Oskar learn to write.

241
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:18,844
Stop that.

242
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:24,110
You'll never learn
to read and write the great classics,

243
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:26,682
the eternal truths:

244
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:28,482
"Die unto life!"

245
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:49,410
Hold it.
Now I've got all of you.

246
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:52,205
A bit more to the right, Alex.

247
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,944
For you on your first day of school.

248
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,747
Eyes this way, please.

249
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:02,152
Good morning.

250
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:04,592
Good morning, children.

251
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:09,992
My name is Spollenhauer,
and I am your teacher.

252
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:11,499
Be seated.

253
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:16,272
And now, dear children,
do any of you know a song?

254
00:26:20,011 --> 00:26:22,172
You must be little Oskar.

255
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:24,212
We've heard so much about you.

256
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:26,043
You play that so well.

257
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:28,811
Isn't our Oskar a fine drummer?

258
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:34,488
But now let's put the drum away.

259
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:36,889
It must be sleepy.

260
00:26:38,463 --> 00:26:41,796
After school,
you can have it back again.

261
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:48,095
You're a naughty Oskar.

262
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:54,470
I will now read you the schedule.

263
00:26:54,646 --> 00:26:58,980
Monday:
writing, arithmetic, reading,

264
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:00,913
religion.

265
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:03,486
All together: writing.

266
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:06,390
Arithmetic.

267
00:27:07,525 --> 00:27:09,425
Oskar, stop that!

268
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:11,255
Religion.

269
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:32,482
Get out!

270
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:40,124
Strange. Very strange.

271
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:42,587
How old is he, did you say?

272
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:44,092
Six, Doctor.

273
00:27:44,262 --> 00:27:46,730
Inge, kindly undress Oskar.

274
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:50,800
How long is it
since he fell down the stairs?

275
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:53,631
Three years on September 12.

276
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:56,296
We'd better examine his spine again.

277
00:27:56,574 --> 00:27:59,600
Be a good boy.
I'll give it right back.

278
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:03,472
Oskar, give me your drum.
I'll hold it.

279
00:28:03,648 --> 00:28:06,947
See, you can't get
out of your shirt.

280
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:11,214
Oskar, if you're not good,
the doctor won't make you well.

281
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:15,155
Come, child.
Give me the drum.

282
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,183
Amazing.

283
00:28:53,198 --> 00:28:55,029
I shall write a paper

284
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,330
about this for one
of our medical journals,

285
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:01,631
if you have no objection.

286
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:06,367
Amazing.

287
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:08,771
Truly amazing.

288
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:18,483
<i>"The destructive force
ofthis local phenomenon</i>

289
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:22,618
<i>is such as to suggest</i>

290
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:27,527
<i>an anomalous formation
of the lower larynx</i>

291
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:32,432
in little Oskar Matzerath.

292
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:37,439
Nor can we exclude the hypothesis

293
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:41,636
of a concomitant development
of the vocal cords."

294
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:44,873
Did you hear that?
In a medical journal.

295
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:47,443
Does the doctor say
why he won't grow?

296
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,551
<i>You'll have to ask him that.</i>

297
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:53,546
Why he won't grow.

298
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:55,056
Cut it out.

299
00:29:56,227 --> 00:29:57,785
He's yours as much as mine.

300
00:29:57,962 --> 00:29:59,793
If not more.

301
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:02,091
Who left the cellar door open,
you or me?

302
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:22,920
Uncle Hailandt,
come spit in the soup.

303
00:30:23,087 --> 00:30:26,750
Look what I found in the pond!
Two frogs!

304
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:41,461
What are you doing, Tom Thumb?

305
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:56,750
Make Oskar taste the soup!

306
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:27,647
Now it's your turn.
You'll love it.

307
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:30,018
A treat.

308
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:31,519
Open your mouth.

309
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:38,887
Good, huh?

310
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:41,327
Just a little more.

311
00:32:14,198 --> 00:32:18,066
<i>Labesweg and its backyards
hemmed me in.</i>

312
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:22,900
<i>I longed for space
and took every opportunity</i>

313
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:26,271
<i>to escape the persecution
by the soup cooks</i>

314
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:29,242
<i>by going into town</i>

315
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:32,474
<i>alone or with Mama.</i>

316
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:32,840
Your drum's busted.

317
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:36,339
Want me to mend it?

318
00:33:37,415 --> 00:33:39,906
No, he's getting a new one.

319
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,783
My respects, ma'am.

320
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,193
Hello, Uncle Jan.

321
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,214
You coming too?

322
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,152
I must leave you now.

323
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:23,625
I have a few errands to run.

324
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:25,319
Good-bye, Agnes.

325
00:34:26,764 --> 00:34:29,426
This is for your drum, Oskar.

326
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,303
Good-bye, cousin.

327
00:34:47,618 --> 00:34:48,915
Good day, Mr. Markus.

328
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,813
Who do we have here?
Oh, Mrs. Matzerath.

329
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:54,617
And little Oskar.
Here for a new drum?

330
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:56,885
Yes, Mr. Markus. Again.

331
00:34:57,061 --> 00:34:58,892
He's always at it.

332
00:34:59,063 --> 00:35:02,294
I never know what day it is -
I mean, what day of the week -

333
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:05,095
except when you come in.

334
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:08,432
Then something tells me
it must be Thursday again.

335
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:14,170
You have such beautiful hands.
Worth their weight in gold.

336
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:18,605
Oskar, see that box?
Hand it to me.

337
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,710
That's it.

338
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:25,845
Look here, Mrs. Matzerath.
Beautiful silk stockings.

339
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:28,685
Pure silk. Fine quality.

340
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:33,057
One, two, three pairs.
Take them.

341
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:35,256
They'll suit you fine,
and they're a bargain.

342
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:37,333
Much too expensive for me.

343
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:40,335
- They're worth it.
- Maybe another time.

344
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:43,338
I'll let them go
for half a gulden.

345
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:45,906
That cheap?

346
00:35:46,878 --> 00:35:49,312
No, Markus, that would be
like giving them away.

347
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,040
Take them,
and don't ask questions.

348
00:35:52,216 --> 00:35:54,013
And now, Oskar,

349
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:56,745
what can I do for the little prince?

350
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:00,590
Oh, is it a new drum we need?

351
00:36:00,758 --> 00:36:04,285
Just choose one.
You know where they are!

352
00:36:05,296 --> 00:36:06,558
See, Oskar?

353
00:36:07,031 --> 00:36:08,396
He's so happy.

354
00:36:11,035 --> 00:36:13,936
Mr. Markus, could little Oskar

355
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:16,403
stay with you for half an hour?

356
00:36:18,075 --> 00:36:20,066
I have some important business.

357
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:21,609
Ah, yes.

358
00:36:21,779 --> 00:36:23,542
I'll watch him
like the apple of my eye.

359
00:36:23,714 --> 00:36:26,376
See to your important business,
and don't worry.

360
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:29,247
The little prince will stay with me

361
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,349
while you take care
of your important business,

362
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:35,549
just like every Thursday.

363
00:41:44,935 --> 00:41:46,493
We'll close off the street.

364
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:16,361
<i>Danzig is and always
has been German.</i>

365
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:21,062
<i>If not for the German people,</i>

366
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:24,841
<i>all these eastern regions</i>

367
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:31,704
<i>would have succumbed
to total barbarism...</i>

368
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:53,093
Have a nice stroll?

369
00:43:02,212 --> 00:43:05,181
Everyone can hear the Fuhrer but us!

370
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:25,200
What's wrong with you?

371
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:27,504
I suffer from an illness.

372
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:29,830
What is it?

373
00:43:30,374 --> 00:43:31,807
I've gone

374
00:43:31,976 --> 00:43:33,773
birdbrained!

375
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:57,324
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
the smallest of the small:

376
00:43:57,501 --> 00:43:59,992
Bebra and his midgets!

377
00:46:08,198 --> 00:46:09,688
My word!

378
00:46:11,502 --> 00:46:14,994
Now it's three-year-olds
who choose to stop growing.

379
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:18,901
My name is Bebra.

380
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:25,112
Directly descended
from Prince Eugene...

381
00:46:27,084 --> 00:46:31,248
whose father was Louis XlV,

382
00:46:31,421 --> 00:46:34,515
and not some Savoyard,
as has been claimed.

383
00:46:35,859 --> 00:46:40,922
I stopped my growth
on my tenth birthday.

384
00:46:42,266 --> 00:46:45,633
Better late than never.

385
00:46:49,206 --> 00:46:50,935
Tell me, my dear Oskar,

386
00:46:51,108 --> 00:46:53,474
you must be 14 or 15 now.

387
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,271
Twelve and a half.

388
00:46:55,445 --> 00:46:58,414
No! And how old do you think I am?

389
00:47:00,884 --> 00:47:03,079
Thirty-five.

390
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:06,012
Flatterer!

391
00:47:06,757 --> 00:47:09,123
I was 35 once.

392
00:47:09,526 --> 00:47:13,553
I shall be 53 in August.

393
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:15,561
I could be your grandfather.

394
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:18,792
Are you an artist too?
- Not really.

395
00:47:18,969 --> 00:47:20,596
Although...

396
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:35,250
as you see, I can lay claim
to a certain artistry.

397
00:47:41,124 --> 00:47:43,649
You must join us. You must!

398
00:47:45,295 --> 00:47:46,819
You know, Mr. Bebra...

399
00:47:52,002 --> 00:47:53,833
to tell the truth,

400
00:47:54,004 --> 00:47:57,098
I prefer to be
a member of the audience

401
00:47:57,274 --> 00:48:00,971
and let my little art
flower in secret.

402
00:48:01,778 --> 00:48:03,439
My dear Oskar,

403
00:48:04,248 --> 00:48:07,445
trust an experienced colleague.

404
00:48:07,618 --> 00:48:10,587
Our kind must never sit
in the audience.

405
00:48:10,821 --> 00:48:13,051
Our kind must perform

406
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:14,417
and run the show,

407
00:48:14,691 --> 00:48:16,955
or it's the others that will run us.

408
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:20,894
And the others are coming.

409
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:23,191
They will take over the fairgrounds.

410
00:48:23,367 --> 00:48:25,392
They will stage torchlight parades.

411
00:48:25,669 --> 00:48:28,604
They will build platforms
and fill them,

412
00:48:28,772 --> 00:48:32,606
and from those platforms
preach our destruction.

413
00:48:38,815 --> 00:48:42,615
They're looking for you, dear friend.
But we will meet again.

414
00:48:42,786 --> 00:48:45,482
We're too little to lose each other.

415
00:48:59,336 --> 00:49:00,735
Good day.

416
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:05,802
Come on.

417
00:49:07,077 --> 00:49:08,442
Good-bye.

418
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:17,744
They are coming!

419
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:45,672
Now you can open them.

420
00:50:16,646 --> 00:50:18,204
Thank you, Uncle Jan.

421
00:50:18,715 --> 00:50:21,377
A pleasant Sunday to you all.

422
00:50:21,952 --> 00:50:24,216
These damn leggings
keep falling down!

423
00:50:24,388 --> 00:50:25,548
Morning, cousin.

424
00:50:26,723 --> 00:50:28,452
I need boots.

425
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:30,422
You know they cost way too much.

426
00:50:30,594 --> 00:50:32,425
Or leather gaiters at least.

427
00:50:33,597 --> 00:50:35,087
How do I look?

428
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,201
- Going to the demonstration?
- Yes, at the fairground.

429
00:50:41,438 --> 00:50:42,769
A mass rally.

430
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:47,805
How are you?

431
00:50:48,078 --> 00:50:50,569
Gauleiter Lobsack is speaking.

432
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:53,209
And what a speaker he is.

433
00:50:54,518 --> 00:50:58,818
I tell you, these are historic days.

434
00:50:58,989 --> 00:51:02,584
A man can't stand aside.
Gotta join in.

435
00:51:05,495 --> 00:51:08,328
<i>You should read the Danzig Sentinel.</i>

436
00:51:09,533 --> 00:51:12,229
Your siding with Poland is crazy.

437
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:13,994
I've told you a thousand times.

438
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:16,997
I am a Pole.

439
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:18,738
Think it over.

440
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:21,773
Take your umbrella.
It looks like rain.

441
00:51:21,945 --> 00:51:24,607
An umbrella? With this uniform?

442
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:30,251
The stew is on.
Stir it now and then.

443
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:33,150
It'll be done in 20 minutes.
- Want a bite to eat before you go?

444
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:34,390
No time.

445
00:51:34,658 --> 00:51:37,456
Duty is duty,
and schnapps is schnapps.

446
00:51:52,242 --> 00:51:57,202
<i>My dear fellow countrymen
and countrywomen</i>

447
00:51:57,380 --> 00:52:00,872
from Danzig and Langfuhr,

448
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:04,416
from Ohra, Schidlitz

449
00:52:04,588 --> 00:52:06,488
and Praust,

450
00:52:06,656 --> 00:52:10,922
from the hills and from the lowlands,

451
00:52:11,094 --> 00:52:13,756
I know you all

452
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:19,232
cherish but one wish.

453
00:52:19,402 --> 00:52:21,597
It has been our heartfelt wish

454
00:52:23,406 --> 00:52:26,603
ever since the shameful
Versailles Diktat

455
00:52:26,776 --> 00:52:31,907
separated us from our beloved
German fatherland.

456
00:52:32,082 --> 00:52:34,175
And that wish is

457
00:52:34,451 --> 00:52:36,351
to go home to the Reich!

458
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:50,030
What is the meaning
of this Free State

459
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:54,299
that was so generously
foisted on us?

460
00:52:56,873 --> 00:53:03,073
It means that our waterfront
is crawling with Polacks.

461
00:53:03,246 --> 00:53:06,238
And in the middle
of our beloved Old City,

462
00:53:06,416 --> 00:53:10,147
they've stuck a Polish post office -

463
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,311
a present we can do without.

464
00:53:18,228 --> 00:53:20,219
We Germans had

465
00:53:20,397 --> 00:53:22,331
post offices

466
00:53:22,499 --> 00:53:26,902
before the Poles

467
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:28,697
even thought of writing letters.

468
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:31,500
We taught them the alphabet.

469
00:53:32,909 --> 00:53:36,675
And now, dear party comrades,

470
00:53:36,846 --> 00:53:39,337
Iet us welcome
our guest from the Reich

471
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:42,450
whom the Fuhrer sent to greet us.

472
00:53:43,787 --> 00:53:46,585
Party comrade Albert Forster

473
00:53:46,756 --> 00:53:50,248
has just arrived on the field.

474
00:57:47,831 --> 00:57:49,458
I've got sand in my shoe.

475
00:58:51,561 --> 00:58:54,587
Hey, can you catch them
with a clothesline?

476
00:58:55,098 --> 00:58:57,999
Yes, sure you can.

477
00:58:58,268 --> 00:59:00,793
Real fish, or just old shoes?

478
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:04,667
Suppose we take a look.

479
00:59:04,841 --> 00:59:06,502
Maybe something's there.

480
00:59:25,995 --> 00:59:27,895
Get the sack.

481
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:09,902
You should have seen them
after the battle of Jutland,

482
01:00:10,707 --> 01:00:15,406
when we and the English -

483
01:00:19,816 --> 01:00:21,249
See what I mean?

484
01:00:21,417 --> 01:00:23,317
After the battle...

485
01:00:27,156 --> 01:00:31,286
they were this thick.

486
01:00:43,506 --> 01:00:46,134
He wanted 1.50,

487
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:48,140
but I gave him a gulden.

488
01:01:25,715 --> 01:01:28,650
Don't expect me
to touch your eels.

489
01:01:28,818 --> 01:01:31,048
Don't put on airs.

490
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:33,984
I'll never eat fish again.
Certainly not eels.

491
01:01:34,157 --> 01:01:38,389
You've always eaten them,
and you've known where they come from.

492
01:01:39,562 --> 01:01:40,859
Quiet.

493
01:01:41,764 --> 01:01:43,857
Stop that drumming
once and for all.

494
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:46,467
- Leave the child alone!
- And sit down!

495
01:01:46,636 --> 01:01:48,797
Who was to blame?
Who left the cellar door open?

496
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:52,967
That's old news. Sit down.

497
01:01:53,142 --> 01:01:56,339
See if they're not delicious.

498
01:01:56,512 --> 01:01:59,072
Come on. Dig in.

499
01:01:59,248 --> 01:02:03,048
Fresh eel with dill sauce,

500
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:06,552
bay leaf
and a twist of lemon peel.

501
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:09,521
Don't make her eat
if she doesn't want to.

502
01:02:09,692 --> 01:02:11,785
- Keep out of this.
- Leave her alone.

503
01:02:11,961 --> 01:02:13,895
She'll only vomit.

504
01:02:14,063 --> 01:02:17,692
I paid good money for these eels.
Just try them.

505
01:02:18,835 --> 01:02:23,295
They've been well cleaned and washed.

506
01:02:25,808 --> 01:02:29,403
No gall. Light, healthy liver.

507
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:31,274
And so fresh!

508
01:02:31,781 --> 01:02:33,908
All the disgusting parts are gone.

509
01:02:36,285 --> 01:02:38,116
Oskar, sit down.

510
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:42,617
I slaved over the stove for hours.

511
01:02:42,792 --> 01:02:45,590
Some people would be
very happy to eat my eels.

512
01:03:15,158 --> 01:03:16,921
I don't know what to do!

513
01:03:17,093 --> 01:03:18,788
Alfred, calm down.

514
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:22,021
I can't talk to her.
And the fish is getting cold.

515
01:03:22,198 --> 01:03:23,893
Women are more sensitive.

516
01:03:24,901 --> 01:03:28,564
You talk to her.
If only she'd calm down.

517
01:05:28,858 --> 01:05:31,349
Shouldn't I warm them up at least?

518
01:06:05,227 --> 01:06:08,958
No, don't do it with Bronski.

519
01:06:10,032 --> 01:06:13,399
He joined the the wrong side
when he went with the Polish post office.

520
01:06:13,569 --> 01:06:15,537
Don't bet on the Poles.

521
01:06:15,705 --> 01:06:18,435
If you must bet, bet on the Germans.

522
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:21,876
Sooner or later, they'll take over.

523
01:06:22,445 --> 01:06:25,380
Imagine when the Germans come
and you're stuck with Bronski,

524
01:06:25,548 --> 01:06:27,106
<i>that meshugganah Pole.</i>

525
01:06:27,283 --> 01:06:30,741
You'll be in trouble then.

526
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:34,083
Why not bet on Matzerath?

527
01:06:39,662 --> 01:06:44,031
Or, if you'd do me the great honor,

528
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:45,963
bet on me,

529
01:06:46,135 --> 01:06:48,000
Sigismund Markus,

530
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:50,297
who was just baptized.

531
01:06:50,473 --> 01:06:52,304
No, Markus. Please!

532
01:06:52,475 --> 01:06:54,102
We could go to London

533
01:06:54,276 --> 01:06:57,370
Iike everybody else,
before the Germans come.

534
01:07:02,451 --> 01:07:04,612
Look. There he is.

535
01:07:04,787 --> 01:07:07,483
We'll take him with us to London.

536
01:07:07,656 --> 01:07:09,487
He'll live like a prince.

537
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:14,461
Thank you, Markus,
but it's impossible,

538
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:16,723
and not because of Bronski.

539
01:07:16,899 --> 01:07:20,391
I'm glad to hear that. I had a feeling
it wasn't because of him.

540
01:07:20,569 --> 01:07:22,059
Steer clear of Bronski,

541
01:07:22,238 --> 01:07:24,706
and stick to Matzerath.

542
01:08:41,183 --> 01:08:42,616
Come on.

543
01:08:44,153 --> 01:08:45,518
Play.

544
01:08:46,222 --> 01:08:47,780
One two, one two...

545
01:08:51,293 --> 01:08:54,922
You can't or you won't?

546
01:08:55,197 --> 01:08:56,528
Rascal!

547
01:08:56,699 --> 01:08:58,291
'Cause you can do everything else.

548
01:08:58,467 --> 01:09:02,767
I have sinned
in thought, word and deed.

549
01:09:02,938 --> 01:09:04,906
Alone or with others?

550
01:09:05,074 --> 01:09:06,405
With someone else.

551
01:09:06,575 --> 01:09:08,702
When and where?

552
01:09:08,878 --> 01:09:11,039
Thursdays, on the Tischlergasse.

553
01:09:11,213 --> 01:09:14,649
But, child, that same
filthy neighborhood?

554
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:18,913
I can't help it, Father.
I try, but I can't.

555
01:09:19,088 --> 01:09:22,489
But, my dear Mrs. Matzerath,
the consequences.

556
01:09:23,959 --> 01:09:26,018
They're already here, Father.

557
01:09:36,272 --> 01:09:38,900
What do you think you're doing?

558
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:40,164
Little brat.

559
01:09:49,818 --> 01:09:52,480
Father, what will I do
with the child?

560
01:09:53,989 --> 01:09:57,049
I love my little Oskar,

561
01:09:57,226 --> 01:10:00,127
but he's already 14.

562
01:10:00,296 --> 01:10:04,528
He's always in trouble,
and now this! Oh, Father -

563
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:08,065
Pray, Mrs. Matzerath, pray.

564
01:10:10,439 --> 01:10:12,464
Oskar, stop it.

565
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:07,598
What did I tell you?
Fish again.

566
01:12:08,737 --> 01:12:10,637
She doesn't eat.
She gulps it down.

567
01:12:10,806 --> 01:12:12,831
And she's surprised
it doesn't stay down.

568
01:12:13,008 --> 01:12:15,476
God, how can this be?

569
01:12:15,644 --> 01:12:17,976
This has been going on
for three weeks.

570
01:12:18,146 --> 01:12:22,173
First it was kippers and sardines.
Now it's pickled herring.

571
01:12:24,620 --> 01:12:29,080
I've tried everything.
I'm at the end of my rope.

572
01:12:29,258 --> 01:12:31,556
Why didn't you call me sooner?

573
01:12:46,542 --> 01:12:48,601
Agnes, tell me what's wrong.

574
01:12:52,347 --> 01:12:54,338
You know
fish doesn't agree with you!

575
01:12:55,584 --> 01:12:57,211
Take it from me.

576
01:12:57,386 --> 01:13:01,846
A single communist joining the party
makes the Fuhrer happier

577
01:13:02,024 --> 01:13:04,993
than ten conservatives

578
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:08,687
who just join out of fear,
not grasping that a new era has begun.

579
01:13:08,864 --> 01:13:10,661
Yes, a new era!

580
01:13:10,933 --> 01:13:12,332
Doesn't want to live.

581
01:13:12,501 --> 01:13:14,526
Doesn't want to die.

582
01:13:14,703 --> 01:13:17,001
I don't know.

583
01:13:18,607 --> 01:13:22,099
It's too much of everything,
and it keeps piling up.

584
01:13:24,780 --> 01:13:28,307
I used to say that too,
but I made it.

585
01:13:30,352 --> 01:13:33,446
Think it was easy when Koljaiczek -

586
01:13:33,622 --> 01:13:35,283
your father -

587
01:13:36,458 --> 01:13:38,551
disappeared under the timber

588
01:13:40,195 --> 01:13:42,220
and never came back?

589
01:13:42,397 --> 01:13:45,889
- But at least he was gone!
- Gone, you say. The man was gone.

590
01:13:46,535 --> 01:13:49,971
How can you talk like that
when you do it with two men

591
01:13:50,138 --> 01:13:51,571
and never get enough?

592
01:13:51,740 --> 01:13:53,503
That'll do, Mother!

593
01:13:53,675 --> 01:13:55,506
You're pregnant!
So what?

594
01:13:56,845 --> 01:13:59,143
There's plenty of room here.

595
01:14:01,817 --> 01:14:04,115
When will it be?

596
01:14:05,587 --> 01:14:08,078
Never! It'll never be!

597
01:14:16,865 --> 01:14:18,628
I had no way of knowing!

598
01:14:28,677 --> 01:14:29,735
Help her.

599
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:41,086
Why don't you want the child?

600
01:14:46,728 --> 01:14:48,787
It doesn't matter whose it is.

601
01:15:12,387 --> 01:15:13,752
No trumpet playing here.

602
01:15:13,922 --> 01:15:16,618
Go and blow that thing
with your Brown Shirts.

603
01:15:17,259 --> 01:15:19,352
Soon your blowing will all be over.

604
01:15:19,895 --> 01:15:20,884
Nazi swine!

605
01:15:21,063 --> 01:15:22,394
Red pig!

606
01:16:41,810 --> 01:16:45,109
What are you doing here?

607
01:16:47,082 --> 01:16:48,709
You got no business here!

608
01:16:48,884 --> 01:16:51,318
'Cause you're -
Wanna know what you are?

609
01:16:51,486 --> 01:16:54,717
A kike.
That's what you are.

610
01:17:16,378 --> 01:17:17,970
Ah, it's little Oskar.

611
01:17:21,783 --> 01:17:23,944
See what they're doing to Markus,

612
01:17:24,119 --> 01:17:26,781
who was baptized
just like them?

613
01:17:28,957 --> 01:17:30,982
Is your drum broken?

614
01:17:31,893 --> 01:17:34,919
Come see me.
You'll have a new drum.

615
01:17:40,869 --> 01:17:43,394
A beautiful day!

616
01:17:43,572 --> 01:17:48,032
She's gone to the place
where everything's so cheap.

617
01:17:50,245 --> 01:17:52,907
Yes, it's a beautiful day.

618
01:17:53,081 --> 01:17:54,673
An unforgettable day.

619
01:17:55,417 --> 01:17:57,578
I, too, have seen the Lord.

620
01:17:57,752 --> 01:17:59,617
You've seen the Lord?

621
01:18:26,214 --> 01:18:28,045
A beautiful day.

622
01:18:28,216 --> 01:18:32,084
The Lord has passed.

623
01:18:32,254 --> 01:18:33,983
He was in a hurry.

624
01:21:47,482 --> 01:21:49,950
<i>There once was a drummer.</i>

625
01:21:50,285 --> 01:21:51,809
<i>His name was Oskar.</i>

626
01:21:51,986 --> 01:21:56,980
<i>He lost his poor mama,
who had eaten too much fish.</i>

627
01:21:57,158 --> 01:22:00,594
<i>There once was a gullible people</i>

628
01:22:00,762 --> 01:22:03,458
<i>who believed in Santa Claus.</i>

629
01:22:03,631 --> 01:22:07,431
<i>But Santa Claus was really</i>

630
01:22:07,602 --> 01:22:09,536
<i>the gas man!</i>

631
01:22:46,141 --> 01:22:49,338
<i>There once was a toy merchant.</i>

632
01:22:50,812 --> 01:22:53,280
<i>His name was Sigismund Markus,</i>

633
01:22:55,984 --> 01:23:00,250
<i>and he sold tin drums
lacquered red and white.</i>

634
01:23:08,997 --> 01:23:12,125
<i>There was once a drummer.</i>

635
01:23:13,668 --> 01:23:15,636
<i>His name was Oskar.</i>

636
01:23:25,313 --> 01:23:28,441
<i>There once was a toy merchant</i>

637
01:23:28,616 --> 01:23:30,379
<i>whose name was Markus...</i>

638
01:23:31,886 --> 01:23:35,913
<i>and he took all the toys
in the world away with him.</i>

639
01:24:35,750 --> 01:24:39,083
<i>September 1, 1939.</i>

640
01:24:40,054 --> 01:24:42,818
<i>You know the date, I assume.</i>

641
01:24:44,626 --> 01:24:48,084
<i>That was when I committed
my second crime.</i>

642
01:24:49,297 --> 01:24:51,697
<i>For I, Oskar the drummer,</i>

643
01:24:51,866 --> 01:24:55,563
<i>not only drummed
my poor mama into her grave.</i>

644
01:24:55,737 --> 01:24:56,965
<i>I also dragged</i>

645
01:24:57,238 --> 01:25:01,868
<i>my poor uncle, and presumably
my father, Jan Bronski,</i>

646
01:25:02,043 --> 01:25:04,238
<i>to the Polish post office,</i>

647
01:25:04,412 --> 01:25:06,972
<i>so causing his death.</i>

648
01:25:11,619 --> 01:25:13,985
- Halt. You can't go through.
- Why not? I work here.

649
01:25:14,155 --> 01:25:16,715
Off limits. Nobody's allowed in.

650
01:25:19,027 --> 01:25:21,188
We only want to see Kobyella.

651
01:25:23,398 --> 01:25:25,457
He's a Pole! Stop him!

652
01:25:33,241 --> 01:25:35,072
It's high time.

653
01:25:35,243 --> 01:25:38,144
Quick, they're issuing weapons.

654
01:25:38,813 --> 01:25:40,838
You're always the last one.
Take this rifle.

655
01:25:42,550 --> 01:25:43,710
Helmet.

656
01:25:44,786 --> 01:25:46,515
The ammunition's over there.

657
01:26:08,676 --> 01:26:10,610
What are you doing here?

658
01:26:10,778 --> 01:26:12,268
Kobyella, repair drum.

659
01:26:12,447 --> 01:26:15,348
Impossible.
Kobyella has no time for you now.

660
01:26:17,151 --> 01:26:21,144
Bronski, are you crazy?
Get this boy out of the way.

661
01:26:22,123 --> 01:26:23,715
Go and hide somewhere, Oskar.

662
01:26:23,891 --> 01:26:26,291
I have to stay here.
Go on, hurry.

663
01:26:32,300 --> 01:26:33,927
<i>On September 1st,</i>

664
01:26:34,102 --> 01:26:35,899
<i>German territory was violated.</i>

665
01:26:37,605 --> 01:26:39,903
<i>Last night, for the first time,</i>

666
01:26:40,074 --> 01:26:44,477
<i>Poles opened fire
on German regulars</i>

667
01:26:44,645 --> 01:26:47,045
<i>on German soil.</i>

668
01:26:48,015 --> 01:26:52,247
<i>Since 5:45 this morning
their fire has been returned.</i>

669
01:27:01,129 --> 01:27:04,724
<i>From now on,
bomb will be answered with bomb.</i>

670
01:27:48,042 --> 01:27:49,703
Where is Uncle Jan?

671
01:28:48,536 --> 01:28:51,505
The drum! Jan, the drum!

672
01:28:55,476 --> 01:28:57,307
Get down!

673
01:28:57,778 --> 01:28:59,109
The drum!

674
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:01,009
Oskar, take cover!

675
01:29:02,517 --> 01:29:04,542
You can't stay here, Oskar.

676
01:29:08,623 --> 01:29:10,352
Take cover! Fire!

677
01:30:04,812 --> 01:30:07,076
Hey, Kobyella, don't give up.

678
01:30:10,651 --> 01:30:14,519
I'll fasten you down.
Then you won't tip over.

679
01:30:56,964 --> 01:30:58,454
Is it my turn?

680
01:31:03,270 --> 01:31:06,296
With one play, two contras,
three schneiders, four times clubs.

681
01:31:06,474 --> 01:31:08,738
That makes 48, or 12 pfennigs.

682
01:31:38,939 --> 01:31:41,908
Hey, don't be a spoilsport.

683
01:31:42,076 --> 01:31:43,976
I can't play by myself.

684
01:31:44,145 --> 01:31:46,079
Pull yourself together.

685
01:31:48,716 --> 01:31:50,547
Kobyella, what's wrong?

686
01:31:56,924 --> 01:31:59,017
Kobyella, I beg you!

687
01:32:00,594 --> 01:32:02,425
I've got a Grand Hand.

688
01:32:02,863 --> 01:32:04,888
Look, a Grand Hand.

689
01:32:18,245 --> 01:32:19,507
Agnes!

690
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:21,211
She's dead.

691
01:32:46,307 --> 01:32:49,743
We surrender. Don't shoot!

692
01:32:53,814 --> 01:32:55,406
Hold your fire!

693
01:33:28,482 --> 01:33:29,949
Freeze! Hands up!

694
01:33:30,217 --> 01:33:31,980
Line up! Move out!

695
01:33:36,457 --> 01:33:38,254
You gonna move, or what?

696
01:33:45,533 --> 01:33:46,830
You too!

697
01:34:22,837 --> 01:34:26,933
<i>They filmed us for a newsreel</i>

698
01:34:27,842 --> 01:34:30,106
<i>that was shown
in all the movie houses,</i>

699
01:34:30,277 --> 01:34:34,373
<i>because Oskar's experience
at the Polish post office in Danzig</i>

700
01:34:35,282 --> 01:34:41,016
<i>went down in history
as the first battle of World War II.</i>

701
01:35:07,481 --> 01:35:09,915
What? They shot Jan Bronski?

702
01:35:22,363 --> 01:35:28,791
They gathered up
all the cartridge cases.

703
01:35:29,637 --> 01:35:32,367
All but one.

704
01:35:33,540 --> 01:35:36,600
They always forget one.

705
01:35:55,362 --> 01:35:57,455
<i>The Hanseatic Free City of Danzig</i>

706
01:35:57,631 --> 01:36:00,691
<i>celebrated the union
ofits brick Gothic</i>

707
01:36:00,868 --> 01:36:03,234
<i>with the greater German Reich.</i>

708
01:36:05,339 --> 01:36:08,103
This is a big moment in your life.

709
01:36:08,275 --> 01:36:11,301
Keep your eyes open.
You'll have stories to tell.

710
01:36:11,478 --> 01:36:14,538
I think I'll faint if he looks at me!

711
01:36:14,715 --> 01:36:16,114
Here he comes!

712
01:36:51,151 --> 01:36:54,382
This is Maria.
She wants to work for you.

713
01:37:12,873 --> 01:37:16,331
You said you needed somebody
for the customers.

714
01:37:17,644 --> 01:37:19,805
Things can't go on like this.

715
01:37:22,049 --> 01:37:24,677
And for Oskar here.

716
01:37:24,852 --> 01:37:28,583
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.

717
01:37:28,756 --> 01:37:32,556
Blessed art thou among women,
and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.

718
01:37:32,726 --> 01:37:34,751
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us poor sinners,

719
01:37:34,928 --> 01:37:37,419
now and at the hour of our death.

720
01:37:37,598 --> 01:37:38,929
Lord, give us -

721
01:37:39,099 --> 01:37:40,430
Faith.

722
01:37:40,601 --> 01:37:42,432
And take me up to heaven.

723
01:37:48,876 --> 01:37:50,366
Have you gone to the bathroom?

724
01:37:53,547 --> 01:37:55,174
Another tune?

725
01:37:55,349 --> 01:37:57,783
"Mary, My Adoration."

726
01:38:07,728 --> 01:38:11,425
<i>Maria, I love you</i>

727
01:38:11,598 --> 01:38:14,795
<i>With all my heart</i>

728
01:38:14,968 --> 01:38:18,870
<i>Forever and ever</i>

729
01:38:19,039 --> 01:38:21,507
<i>We never will part</i>

730
01:38:28,082 --> 01:38:29,413
Go away!

731
01:38:46,066 --> 01:38:49,297
<i>Disregarding
my anonymous infatuations,</i>

732
01:38:50,437 --> 01:38:53,497
<i>Maria was my first love.</i>

733
01:40:25,098 --> 01:40:26,588
How old are you?

734
01:40:26,767 --> 01:40:28,098
Just turned 16.

735
01:40:28,268 --> 01:40:29,599
Me too.

736
01:40:32,306 --> 01:40:34,297
I can't believe it.

737
01:40:38,312 --> 01:40:41,145
<i>Love cannot be sinful</i>

738
01:40:42,182 --> 01:40:46,278
<i>Even if it were
I wouldn't care</i>

739
01:41:01,735 --> 01:41:03,896
<i>Maria smelled of vanilla.</i>

740
01:41:04,871 --> 01:41:06,566
<i>I wondered why.</i>

741
01:41:06,740 --> 01:41:09,402
<i>Did she rub herself with some root?</i>

742
01:41:10,277 --> 01:41:12,472
<i>Was it some cheap perfume</i>

743
01:41:12,646 --> 01:41:15,308
<i>that she sprayed herself with ?</i>

744
01:41:15,482 --> 01:41:18,451
<i>Oskar resolved to find out.</i>

745
01:43:02,522 --> 01:43:04,217
What are you doing?

746
01:43:12,366 --> 01:43:13,890
Hey, stop it!

747
01:43:33,520 --> 01:43:35,181
You little rascal.

748
01:43:35,789 --> 01:43:37,984
You dive in, not knowing a thing.

749
01:43:47,667 --> 01:43:48,929
Good evening.

750
01:43:50,137 --> 01:43:52,799
- Gonna be late?
- Could be.

751
01:43:52,973 --> 01:43:54,531
Too many victories to celebrate.

752
01:43:56,076 --> 01:43:57,566
You can sleep with Maria.

753
01:43:57,744 --> 01:44:00,713
There's plenty of room
in my bed for Oskar.

754
01:44:00,881 --> 01:44:02,849
He's just a shrimp.

755
01:44:03,950 --> 01:44:07,511
<i>Quick, Oskar, into the hay.</i>

756
01:44:07,687 --> 01:44:09,177
Come up here!

757
01:44:10,824 --> 01:44:12,655
Look. He's so happy.

758
01:44:23,770 --> 01:44:25,101
Good night.

759
01:47:00,760 --> 01:47:03,024
It's a quarter to.

760
01:47:03,196 --> 01:47:05,687
A little more. Just a little.

761
01:47:07,601 --> 01:47:09,728
But be careful.

762
01:47:09,903 --> 01:47:11,234
Don't worry.

763
01:47:16,710 --> 01:47:18,371
Almost. Almost.

764
01:47:19,946 --> 01:47:22,073
Just a little more.
But be careful!

765
01:47:22,248 --> 01:47:24,079
I am!

766
01:47:27,354 --> 01:47:28,446
Go away!

767
01:47:39,366 --> 01:47:40,697
What are -

768
01:47:40,867 --> 01:47:42,198
Alfred, stop it!

769
01:47:42,369 --> 01:47:45,133
Is it the kid's fault
you're not careful?

770
01:47:45,305 --> 01:47:48,900
Me? Who kept asking for more?

771
01:47:49,075 --> 01:47:53,136
I said, "Be careful. It's coming soon."
But it never came at all.

772
01:47:53,313 --> 01:47:56,373
Never enough.
You're all the same.

773
01:47:56,549 --> 01:48:00,007
In, out, finished.
That's your idea of love.

774
01:48:00,186 --> 01:48:02,484
Well, go look for somebody else.

775
01:48:02,656 --> 01:48:05,250
Think I'm some kind of electric bell?

776
01:48:05,425 --> 01:48:07,723
And you never take precautions!

777
01:48:07,894 --> 01:48:10,727
Stop bawling. I'm fed up.

778
01:48:12,399 --> 01:48:15,300
Then go back
to your comrades, you jerk.

779
01:48:15,468 --> 01:48:17,595
I need a change, that's for sure.

780
01:48:17,771 --> 01:48:19,102
Women!

781
01:48:19,272 --> 01:48:23,174
They're all a bunch
of quick squirters. Beat it!

782
01:48:23,343 --> 01:48:26,176
Get yourself a POW
if you're in heat.

783
01:48:26,813 --> 01:48:29,008
Maybe the frog
that brings the beer.

784
01:48:29,182 --> 01:48:31,013
Maybe he'll satisfy you.

785
01:48:40,827 --> 01:48:44,058
I see love as something
more than smuttiness.

786
01:48:45,565 --> 01:48:48,830
Next time I'll play cards.
Then I'll know what to expect.

787
01:50:17,023 --> 01:50:19,389
You nasty little dwarf!

788
01:50:19,559 --> 01:50:22,084
You crazy midget!

789
01:50:22,262 --> 01:50:25,698
You belong in the loony bin,
you scumbag!

790
01:50:44,417 --> 01:50:46,442
Oskar, I didn't mean it.

791
01:51:18,051 --> 01:51:19,780
Now you'll have your own room.

792
01:51:19,953 --> 01:51:21,443
He'll soon be 17.

793
01:52:37,897 --> 01:52:40,422
<i>Come on in.</i>

794
01:52:42,869 --> 01:52:45,167
<i>You'll freeze out there.</i>

795
01:52:55,448 --> 01:52:57,245
Want to come in for a while?

796
01:53:23,476 --> 01:53:25,706
Come a little closer, Oskar.

797
01:53:27,080 --> 01:53:29,378
Come under the covers
where it's warm.

798
01:53:29,549 --> 01:53:31,642
It's dreadfully cold.

799
01:53:31,818 --> 01:53:34,218
Greff doesn't give us enough heat.

800
01:53:34,387 --> 01:53:35,718
Come in.

801
01:53:49,202 --> 01:53:50,533
Go ahead.

802
01:53:58,277 --> 01:54:00,108
Greff wants to harden his body.

803
01:54:01,948 --> 01:54:04,280
He loves youth and hard bodies,

804
01:54:04,450 --> 01:54:06,543
but he likes boys more than girls.

805
01:54:07,520 --> 01:54:11,479
<i>Victory through strength and joy</i>

806
01:54:19,365 --> 01:54:21,629
My feet are frozen.

807
01:54:21,801 --> 01:54:23,666
A scout is never cold.

808
01:54:35,081 --> 01:54:36,912
They're doing fine in the east.

809
01:54:39,952 --> 01:54:41,852
Leningrad will fall any day.

810
01:54:42,021 --> 01:54:44,421
Kiev's more important
because of the oil.

811
01:54:44,690 --> 01:54:48,217
That was fast! Much faster
than in '15, when I was in the army.

812
01:54:48,394 --> 01:54:50,225
Moscow's the main thing.

813
01:54:52,131 --> 01:54:53,860
Alfred, you carve.

814
01:54:54,934 --> 01:54:57,164
What would we do without Grandma?

815
01:54:57,336 --> 01:55:00,328
Yes, the Kashubians
are still good for something.

816
01:55:00,506 --> 01:55:03,202
Oh, if I could only be out there!

817
01:55:05,144 --> 01:55:07,305
But I'm needed on the home front.

818
01:55:07,480 --> 01:55:09,345
Moscow must be wiped out,

819
01:55:09,515 --> 01:55:12,279
or we'll have to feed
all those people.

820
01:55:12,452 --> 01:55:14,545
The Fuhrer knows that.

821
01:55:14,720 --> 01:55:18,588
They've sent
my Herbert to the front.

822
01:55:20,359 --> 01:55:21,724
To make him fight.

823
01:55:21,894 --> 01:55:23,555
Disciplinary battalion.

824
01:55:25,064 --> 01:55:28,431
Starve 'em!
Starve all our enemies!

825
01:55:28,601 --> 01:55:29,932
That'll end the war.

826
01:55:30,103 --> 01:55:31,661
Breast or drumstick?

827
01:55:31,838 --> 01:55:33,430
I'd like a drumstick.

828
01:55:36,843 --> 01:55:38,606
It's nice and juicy.

829
01:55:38,778 --> 01:55:40,769
The nations of Europe
are all on our side.

830
01:55:40,947 --> 01:55:42,141
The stalwart Finns.

831
01:55:42,315 --> 01:55:44,442
No goose without sage!

832
01:55:44,617 --> 01:55:48,713
- The Magyars, the Rumanians.
- Oskar, what a splendid feast.

833
01:55:48,888 --> 01:55:51,516
We're advancing on the oceans too.

834
01:55:51,691 --> 01:55:53,249
<i>For we're sailing</i>

835
01:55:53,426 --> 01:55:55,690
No goose, Greff?

836
01:55:55,862 --> 01:55:57,523
You know I don't eat meat.

837
01:55:57,697 --> 01:56:01,690
<i>A youthful nation rises
ready for the storm</i>

838
01:56:01,868 --> 01:56:04,769
<i>Raise the banner higher</i>

839
01:56:18,718 --> 01:56:23,052
This isn't a Kashubian goose anymore.
It's a German goose.

840
01:56:23,222 --> 01:56:25,690
Anyway, it's delicious.

841
01:56:25,858 --> 01:56:30,693
Now you've got
a little brother, Oskar.

842
01:56:30,863 --> 01:56:32,888
You'll soon be able to play with him.

843
01:56:33,065 --> 01:56:35,499
The butcher's son was killed.

844
01:56:35,668 --> 01:56:38,432
He got the lron Cross, first class.

845
01:56:38,604 --> 01:56:41,095
Second class!

846
01:56:41,274 --> 01:56:43,902
If I say it's first, it's first!

847
01:56:44,076 --> 01:56:45,634
In any case, he's dead.

848
01:56:47,280 --> 01:56:49,009
Kurt, my son -

849
01:56:50,283 --> 01:56:52,444
You are definitely my son.

850
01:56:54,353 --> 01:56:56,913
When you're three,

851
01:56:57,089 --> 01:56:59,023
I'll give you a drum,

852
01:56:59,292 --> 01:57:01,226
and if you want to stop growing,

853
01:57:01,928 --> 01:57:04,158
I'll show you how it's done.

854
01:57:12,071 --> 01:57:13,470
An autograph, please.

855
01:57:13,706 --> 01:57:16,800
May I have your autograph?

856
01:57:21,247 --> 01:57:23,681
May I make the same request?

857
01:57:24,183 --> 01:57:25,673
Very kind of you.

858
01:57:35,494 --> 01:57:37,462
My dear Oskar!

859
01:57:38,564 --> 01:57:42,000
How glad I am to see you again!

860
01:57:42,168 --> 01:57:46,366
Didn't I tell you?
We're too little to lose each other.

861
01:57:48,241 --> 01:57:51,267
Splendid, splendid!
You haven't grown an inch.

862
01:57:56,983 --> 01:57:59,645
Permit me to introduce Oskar,

863
01:57:59,819 --> 01:58:03,220
an old friend
who sings glass to bits.

864
01:58:03,389 --> 01:58:05,789
Signorina Roswitha Raguna,

865
01:58:05,958 --> 01:58:08,449
the great somnambulist.

866
01:58:08,628 --> 01:58:11,256
The joy of our soldiers
on every front,

867
01:58:12,265 --> 01:58:13,755
and of my old age.

868
01:58:24,310 --> 01:58:27,040
You're surprised to see me
in this uniform,

869
01:58:28,114 --> 01:58:31,777
but the Propaganda Ministry
approached us

870
01:58:31,951 --> 01:58:36,581
and asked us to appear
before the country's top leaders.

871
01:58:37,390 --> 01:58:39,187
Filthy politics!

872
01:58:39,358 --> 01:58:41,724
And now we entertain the troops.

873
01:59:01,213 --> 01:59:03,078
A present from Oskar.

874
01:59:07,720 --> 01:59:09,312
You are very talented.

875
01:59:09,488 --> 01:59:12,514
Why don't you join us?
What's to keep you here?

876
01:59:12,692 --> 01:59:15,217
Yes, join us, young man.

877
01:59:15,394 --> 01:59:20,229
Play your drum, sing champagne glasses
and lightbulbs to bits.

878
01:59:20,399 --> 01:59:24,392
The German army of occupation
in fair France, in gay Paris,

879
01:59:24,570 --> 01:59:26,595
will thank you.

880
01:59:31,043 --> 01:59:34,740
<i>Dear tin soldiers ofParis,</i>

881
01:59:34,914 --> 01:59:38,645
<i>Bebra's Front Line Theater
will play for you,</i>

882
01:59:38,818 --> 01:59:40,183
sing for you,

883
01:59:40,353 --> 01:59:43,220
and help you win the war!

884
01:59:53,432 --> 01:59:55,662
What are you thinking about?

885
01:59:56,836 --> 01:59:59,600
My grandmother's skirts.

886
02:00:11,517 --> 02:00:14,509
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

887
02:00:14,687 --> 02:00:17,121
for the first time in France,

888
02:00:17,289 --> 02:00:19,917
a newcomer to our program,

889
02:00:20,092 --> 02:00:22,754
the man with the secret weapon

890
02:00:22,928 --> 02:00:25,863
we have heard so much about:

891
02:00:26,031 --> 02:00:28,727
Oskar the drummer!

892
02:00:28,901 --> 02:00:31,369
Oskar the glass killer!

893
02:00:36,108 --> 02:00:37,439
<i>Mazel tov.</i>

894
02:01:21,320 --> 02:01:24,312
One corporal, five men,
nothing to report.

895
02:01:26,592 --> 02:01:28,822
Thank you.
At ease, Corporal.

896
02:01:28,994 --> 02:01:31,656
You see? Nothing to report.

897
02:01:31,831 --> 02:01:33,526
It's been this way for years.

898
02:01:33,699 --> 02:01:37,692
There's always the tide,
nature's contribution.

899
02:01:37,870 --> 02:01:40,236
That's what keeps our men busy.

900
02:01:41,040 --> 02:01:43,531
That's why we go on
building bunkers.

901
02:01:43,709 --> 02:01:46,234
You have faith in concrete?

902
02:01:46,412 --> 02:01:48,403
We haven't much faith in anything.

903
02:01:49,114 --> 02:01:51,912
Am I right, Corporal?
- Right, sir.

904
02:01:52,918 --> 02:01:54,886
But still you mix and pour.

905
02:02:09,001 --> 02:02:12,664
<i>Is the black witch here today
No, no, no</i>

906
02:02:12,838 --> 02:02:14,328
<i>She will make an evil brew</i>

907
02:02:14,507 --> 02:02:17,476
<i>She will put you in her stew
And then she will devour you</i>

908
02:02:17,643 --> 02:02:20,373
<i>Is the black witch here today
Yes, yes, yes</i>

909
02:02:20,546 --> 02:02:23,947
<i>Look, there she is</i>

910
02:02:37,296 --> 02:02:40,754
Goody! A picnic in the open air!

911
02:02:50,075 --> 02:02:53,203
Real Hungarian salami. Wonderful!

912
02:02:53,379 --> 02:02:55,472
And chocolate from Holland!

913
02:02:56,682 --> 02:03:00,118
And now, dive in.

914
02:03:02,621 --> 02:03:04,486
Dig in, my friends.

915
02:03:05,558 --> 02:03:07,185
Where do we begin?

916
02:03:09,395 --> 02:03:10,919
Ah, caviar.

917
02:03:13,265 --> 02:03:15,290
Rescued from Stalingrad.

918
02:03:48,067 --> 02:03:50,365
Ah, may it soothe our souls!

919
02:03:57,610 --> 02:04:00,340
And now, Signorina Raguna,

920
02:04:00,512 --> 02:04:03,743
could you tell us,

921
02:04:03,916 --> 02:04:06,942
as well as the ladies and gentlemen
present tonight,

922
02:04:07,820 --> 02:04:10,380
the exact date of birth

923
02:04:10,556 --> 02:04:13,616
of Lieutenant Herzog?

924
02:04:14,593 --> 02:04:19,053
April 11,

925
02:04:19,231 --> 02:04:23,429
1915...

926
02:04:24,803 --> 02:04:26,532
in Bremen.

927
02:04:26,705 --> 02:04:29,970
That's right.
And the place too.

928
02:04:30,142 --> 02:04:31,609
Applause

929
02:04:31,777 --> 02:04:36,111
for Signorina Raguna,
the great somnambulist.

930
02:04:40,085 --> 02:04:44,249
I see they're bringing him champagne.

931
02:04:44,423 --> 02:04:47,881
But you'll never drink it.

932
02:04:48,060 --> 02:04:49,789
I'm sorry.
- Why not?

933
02:05:23,562 --> 02:05:25,393
All together!

934
02:05:25,564 --> 02:05:27,464
<i>Where's the witch, black as pitch</i>

935
02:05:51,223 --> 02:05:52,485
Don't be afraid.

936
02:05:52,658 --> 02:05:54,216
Nothing will happen.

937
02:06:01,533 --> 02:06:03,364
My little man.

938
02:06:54,019 --> 02:06:56,453
Children! Quick!

939
02:06:56,622 --> 02:06:57,987
What's the matter?

940
02:06:58,157 --> 02:06:59,988
The Americans are coming.

941
02:07:21,246 --> 02:07:23,510
Oskar, I must have coffee!

942
02:07:23,682 --> 02:07:27,083
I can't go without coffee.
- Roswitha, we're leaving.

943
02:07:39,898 --> 02:07:41,729
A cup of coffee, please.

944
02:07:51,977 --> 02:07:53,638
Roswitha!

945
02:08:15,968 --> 02:08:20,496
<i>Roswitha, I don't know
how old you were.</i>

946
02:08:21,039 --> 02:08:23,837
<i>I only know
that you smelled of cinnamon</i>

947
02:08:24,009 --> 02:08:26,477
<i>and nutmeg.</i>

948
02:08:26,645 --> 02:08:30,775
<i>You could see
into the hearts of men,</i>

949
02:08:30,949 --> 02:08:35,386
<i>but not into your own heart.</i>

950
02:08:37,389 --> 02:08:39,323
Ah, dear Oskar,

951
02:08:39,491 --> 02:08:42,949
we dwarfs and fools
shouldn't dance on concrete

952
02:08:43,128 --> 02:08:45,289
that was poured for giants.

953
02:08:47,766 --> 02:08:50,234
Come on.
We have to move out.

954
02:08:50,402 --> 02:08:52,996
- Well, Oskar, good-bye.
- Good luck.

955
02:08:53,171 --> 02:08:55,435
And keep your chin up.

956
02:09:38,684 --> 02:09:40,311
It's little Oskar!

957
02:09:42,754 --> 02:09:46,713
Hey, Kurt, Oskar's come back
for your birthday.

958
02:09:48,160 --> 02:09:50,890
Your little brother
just turned three.

959
02:09:51,063 --> 02:09:53,588
I brought you a present.

960
02:10:18,757 --> 02:10:21,487
Are you allowed to wear that uniform?

961
02:10:22,728 --> 02:10:24,719
Where have you been?

962
02:10:26,298 --> 02:10:29,893
We looked all over for you.
The police looked high and low.

963
02:10:30,068 --> 02:10:33,196
We had to swear
we hadn't bumped you off.

964
02:10:35,173 --> 02:10:37,164
Well, now you're here.

965
02:11:13,578 --> 02:11:16,069
Beethoven.
Now there was a genius.

966
02:11:32,164 --> 02:11:36,123
Turn it off. It's all over.
Final victory.

967
02:11:55,987 --> 02:12:00,720
Alfred, get rid of your party pin.
The Russkis will be here any minute.

968
02:12:06,164 --> 02:12:08,462
Bury it under the potatoes.

969
02:12:21,179 --> 02:12:22,077
Hands up!

970
02:13:48,233 --> 02:13:49,962
Hands up!

971
02:14:32,844 --> 02:14:34,835
All right, I'll do it.

972
02:14:35,914 --> 02:14:39,111
Hurry! I've still got shoes to sole.

973
02:14:44,356 --> 02:14:46,187
Oh, my! His hand!

974
02:14:47,592 --> 02:14:49,423
It doesn't hurt him now.

975
02:14:58,470 --> 02:15:01,030
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

976
02:15:01,206 --> 02:15:05,404
Hail, Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.

977
02:15:06,011 --> 02:15:06,909
Kurt,

978
02:15:07,078 --> 02:15:08,943
stop throwing stones.

979
02:15:09,114 --> 02:15:13,050
Blessed art thou among women,
and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.

980
02:15:13,218 --> 02:15:15,584
Should I or shouldn't l?

981
02:15:16,554 --> 02:15:19,523
You're 20, Oskar.

982
02:15:21,426 --> 02:15:24,418
Should you or shouldn't you?

983
02:15:25,697 --> 02:15:28,257
You're an orphan, Oskar.

984
02:15:35,740 --> 02:15:38,140
I should, I must,

985
02:15:38,510 --> 02:15:41,411
I will grow!

986
02:15:55,293 --> 02:15:57,454
Kurt, now what have you done?

987
02:16:15,380 --> 02:16:16,711
He's growing!

988
02:16:21,720 --> 02:16:23,051
Look!

989
02:16:23,688 --> 02:16:25,485
See how he's growing!

990
02:16:25,657 --> 02:16:27,989
I have seen the Lord!

991
02:16:29,661 --> 02:16:32,027
The Lord!

992
02:16:34,032 --> 02:16:37,490
See how he's growing!
The Lord!

993
02:16:50,515 --> 02:16:53,916
Just like a Kashubian.

994
02:16:57,055 --> 02:16:59,114
Our heads were made for hard knocks.

995
02:17:00,925 --> 02:17:04,554
And now you're going west,
where things are better.

996
02:17:06,698 --> 02:17:08,893
Only Grandma will stay here,

997
02:17:10,068 --> 02:17:12,901
because you can't move
Kashubians around like that.

998
02:17:14,973 --> 02:17:17,771
They have to stay so other people

999
02:17:19,377 --> 02:17:21,242
can clout them on the head...

1000
02:17:23,948 --> 02:17:26,041
because we're not Polish enough

1001
02:17:27,152 --> 02:17:29,347
or German enough,

1002
02:17:29,521 --> 02:17:31,751
and they always want
everything just right.

1003
02:17:35,560 --> 02:17:36,891
Does it hurt?

1004
02:17:38,096 --> 02:17:40,428
I hope it's not water on the brain.

1005
02:17:41,399 --> 02:17:43,560
When he was three,
he fell down the stairs

1006
02:17:43,735 --> 02:17:45,566
and stopped growing.

1007
02:17:45,737 --> 02:17:48,729
Now he's fallen into a grave
and wants to grow again.

1008
02:18:10,404 --> 02:18:13,824
Babka!

1009
02:18:16,160 --> 02:18:18,621
Babka!

1010
02:18:25,085 --> 02:18:27,129
Babka!!

1011
02:18:38,182 --> 02:18:41,268
Babka! Babka!

1012
02:18:43,562 --> 02:18:46,440
Babka!
