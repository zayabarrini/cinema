1
00:00:09,714 --> 00:00:11,841
In our relations with other people,

2
00:00:11,949 --> 00:00:16,010
we mainly discuss and evaluate

3
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,748
their character and behavior.

4
00:00:19,757 --> 00:00:24,319
That is why I have withdrawn

5
00:00:24,428 --> 00:00:27,090
from nearly all so-called relations.

6
00:00:28,532 --> 00:00:33,265
This has made my old age
rather lonely.

7
00:00:34,839 --> 00:00:40,800
My life has been full of hard work,
and I am grateful.

8
00:00:40,911 --> 00:00:43,641
It began as toil
for bread and butter

9
00:00:43,748 --> 00:00:48,515
and ended in a love for science.

10
00:00:49,086 --> 00:00:54,820
I have a son, also a doctor,
who lives in Lund.

11
00:00:54,925 --> 00:00:59,919
He has been married for many years.
They have no children.

12
00:01:00,631 --> 00:01:06,592
My old mother is still alive
and is very active, in spite of her age.

13
00:01:11,776 --> 00:01:16,543
My wife Karin
has been dead for many years.

14
00:01:18,149 --> 00:01:19,946
Dinner is served, Professor Borg.

15
00:01:23,487 --> 00:01:25,580
Thank you.

16
00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:28,886
I am lucky
in having a good housekeeper.

17
00:01:30,161 --> 00:01:34,495
Perhaps I should add
that I am an old pedant,

18
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:38,829
which at times
has been rather trying

19
00:01:38,936 --> 00:01:43,896
for myself and those around me.

20
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:49,241
My name is Isak Borg,

21
00:01:50,181 --> 00:01:52,615
and I am 78.

22
00:01:53,717 --> 00:01:59,178
Tomorrow I shall receive
an honorary degree in Lund Cathedral.

23
00:02:14,538 --> 00:02:17,837
WILD STRAWBERRIES

24
00:03:18,636 --> 00:03:21,867
In the early hours of June 1st,

25
00:03:21,972 --> 00:03:26,068
I had a weird
and very unpleasant dream.

26
00:03:26,944 --> 00:03:30,436
I dreamt that during
my morning walk

27
00:03:30,547 --> 00:03:36,076
I lost my way among empty streets

28
00:03:36,186 --> 00:03:38,677
with ruined houses.

29
00:08:49,066 --> 00:08:50,158
Are you ill?

30
00:08:50,267 --> 00:08:53,998
Miss Agda, please prepare
some breakfast. I'm taking the car.

31
00:08:54,104 --> 00:08:58,336
Please, Professor! Go back to bed
and I'll bring you coffee at 9:00,

32
00:08:58,442 --> 00:09:01,741
and we'll leave at 10:00 as planned.

33
00:09:01,845 --> 00:09:04,177
Oh, well, I'll go without breakfast.

34
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:08,278
And who will pack your tails?

35
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,420
- I will do it myself.
- And what about me?

36
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:19,422
You can come in the car or fly.
Please yourself.

37
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:24,159
I've looked forward to seeing you get
your honorary degree.

38
00:09:24,268 --> 00:09:28,136
And we had arranged
everything so nicely,

39
00:09:28,238 --> 00:09:31,537
and now you're taking the car.

40
00:09:31,642 --> 00:09:34,270
The ceremony isn't until 5:00.

41
00:09:34,378 --> 00:09:37,905
If I leave at once, I've got 14 hours
before the ceremony.

42
00:09:38,015 --> 00:09:40,483
You'll ruin everything!

43
00:09:41,685 --> 00:09:45,212
What about your son who is expecting you
at the airport in Malmo?

44
00:09:45,322 --> 00:09:49,281
You can think up an explanation.

45
00:09:52,195 --> 00:09:55,323
If you go by car,
I won't come at all.

46
00:09:56,667 --> 00:09:58,760
Now listen, Miss Agda!

47
00:09:58,869 --> 00:10:03,897
Take the car, and you'll ruin
the greatest day of my life.

48
00:10:04,007 --> 00:10:06,441
We're not married, Miss Agda.

49
00:10:06,543 --> 00:10:11,105
I thank God for that every night.

50
00:10:11,214 --> 00:10:15,674
I've used my common sense for 74 years,
and it won't let me down now.

51
00:10:15,786 --> 00:10:18,277
Is that your last word?

52
00:10:18,388 --> 00:10:20,322
Yes.

53
00:10:22,492 --> 00:10:28,021
But I shall say plenty to myself
about selfish, crabby old men

54
00:10:28,131 --> 00:10:33,694
who never think of those who have
served them faithfully for 40 years.

55
00:10:33,804 --> 00:10:36,796
Incredible that I have put up...

56
00:10:36,907 --> 00:10:41,776
with your bossing for so long.

57
00:10:41,878 --> 00:10:45,314
Just give the word,
and I'll leave tomorrow.

58
00:10:45,415 --> 00:10:50,853
I'm going by car anyway,
and you can do as you damn well please.

59
00:10:57,728 --> 00:11:03,689
I happen to be grown-up
and needn't take orders from you.

60
00:11:08,105 --> 00:11:11,233
No one can pack like you, Miss Agda.

61
00:11:11,341 --> 00:11:13,138
Really?

62
00:11:14,211 --> 00:11:15,678
Old sourpuss.

63
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:17,713
Shall I boil you a couple of eggs?

64
00:11:17,814 --> 00:11:22,251
Yes, please, if you will be
so extremely kind.

65
00:11:27,357 --> 00:11:32,624
The faculty should have made me
honorary idiot.

66
00:11:36,767 --> 00:11:40,066
I'll calm the old girl down
with a present.

67
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:42,866
I hate resentful people.

68
00:11:42,973 --> 00:11:47,569
I wouldn't hurt a fly,
let alone Miss Agda.

69
00:11:48,645 --> 00:11:50,272
Toast?

70
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,575
No, don't trouble yourself
on my account.

71
00:11:52,682 --> 00:11:55,583
What are you cross about?

72
00:12:01,324 --> 00:12:03,019
Don't you want a cup?

73
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:10,730
Good morning, Uncle Isak.

74
00:12:10,834 --> 00:12:15,533
Well, well, why is my daughter-in-law
up at this hour?

75
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:19,234
Who can sleep when you and Aunt Agda
are making such a row?

76
00:12:19,342 --> 00:12:21,640
There has been no row.

77
00:12:21,745 --> 00:12:23,440
No, not at all.

78
00:12:25,382 --> 00:12:27,373
You're taking the car to Lund?

79
00:12:27,484 --> 00:12:28,508
Yes.

80
00:12:28,618 --> 00:12:30,347
Can I come with you?

81
00:12:30,454 --> 00:12:31,978
You're going home?

82
00:12:32,088 --> 00:12:34,921
Yes, I want to go home.

83
00:12:35,025 --> 00:12:36,754
Home to Evald?

84
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,487
You don't need to ask why.

85
00:12:38,595 --> 00:12:41,257
I would take the train
if I could afford it.

86
00:12:41,364 --> 00:12:43,628
Of course you may ride with me.

87
00:12:43,733 --> 00:12:45,257
I'll be ready in ten minutes.

88
00:12:48,905 --> 00:12:50,463
Good heavens!

89
00:13:18,802 --> 00:13:23,205
Please don't smoke.
I can't stand cigarette smoke.

90
00:13:23,306 --> 00:13:24,705
I forgot.

91
00:13:24,808 --> 00:13:28,107
There should be a law
forbidding women to smoke.

92
00:13:29,312 --> 00:13:30,574
Beautiful weather.

93
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:34,480
Yes, but sultry.

94
00:13:35,252 --> 00:13:37,720
- I think we'll have a thunderstorm.
- So do I.

95
00:13:37,821 --> 00:13:39,448
No, give me a cigar anytime.

96
00:13:39,556 --> 00:13:42,855
That's stimulating and relaxing.
That's a vice for men.

97
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,928
And what vices may a woman have?

98
00:13:46,029 --> 00:13:49,157
Weeping, giving birth
and speaking ill of her neighbors.

99
00:13:49,266 --> 00:13:52,030
How old are you really, Uncle Isak?

100
00:13:52,135 --> 00:13:53,500
Why do you ask?

101
00:13:53,603 --> 00:13:55,366
No reason. Why?

102
00:13:55,472 --> 00:13:58,373
I know why you asked.

103
00:13:58,475 --> 00:14:00,500
Oh, well.

104
00:14:02,846 --> 00:14:06,839
Don't pretend.
You don't like me. You never have.

105
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:09,384
I only know you
as a father-in-law.

106
00:14:09,486 --> 00:14:11,477
Why are you going home?

107
00:14:11,588 --> 00:14:13,488
On impulse. Nothing more.

108
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:15,854
Evald happens to be my son.

109
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:17,392
So he is.

110
00:14:17,494 --> 00:14:20,952
Evald and I are very much alike.
We have our principles.

111
00:14:21,064 --> 00:14:22,929
You don't need to tell me that.

112
00:14:23,033 --> 00:14:24,432
Now, this loan, for instance.

113
00:14:24,534 --> 00:14:26,399
I know exactly
what you're going to say.

114
00:14:26,503 --> 00:14:29,199
He should have paid it back
when he became an associate professor.

115
00:14:29,306 --> 00:14:31,866
It's a matter of honor for him
to pay back 5,000 a year,

116
00:14:31,975 --> 00:14:33,306
and so on, and so on.

117
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:35,344
A promise is a promise.

118
00:14:35,445 --> 00:14:38,278
For us, it means
that we never can be free together,

119
00:14:38,381 --> 00:14:40,281
and that your son
works himself to death.

120
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,749
You have your own income.

121
00:14:42,852 --> 00:14:44,717
Especially when one considers
the fact that you're filthy rich

122
00:14:44,821 --> 00:14:46,186
and don't need the money.

123
00:14:46,289 --> 00:14:51,886
A promise is a promise.
And I know Evald respects that.

124
00:14:52,929 --> 00:14:55,363
Perhaps.
But he also hates you.

125
00:15:05,742 --> 00:15:09,178
What do you have against me?

126
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,974
Shall I be frank?

127
00:15:11,081 --> 00:15:12,412
Yes, I'm asking you.

128
00:15:13,717 --> 00:15:16,277
You're a selfish old man, Uncle Isak.

129
00:15:16,386 --> 00:15:20,846
You're utterly ruthless
and never listen to anyone but yourself.

130
00:15:21,925 --> 00:15:26,919
But you hide it all behind
your old-world manners and charm.

131
00:15:27,931 --> 00:15:33,426
Beneath your benevolent exterior,
you're as hard as nails.

132
00:15:34,337 --> 00:15:38,740
But you can't fool us
who have seen you at close quarters.

133
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:43,274
Remember when
I came to you a month ago?

134
00:15:44,981 --> 00:15:47,848
I had a stupid idea
that you might help Evald and me.

135
00:15:47,951 --> 00:15:50,419
So I asked to stay with you
for a week or two.

136
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,988
Remember what you answered?

137
00:15:53,089 --> 00:15:56,115
I said I'd be delighted.

138
00:15:57,394 --> 00:16:00,830
Perhaps you've forgotten,
but you said,

139
00:16:01,898 --> 00:16:05,959
"Don't try to draw me
into your marital squabbles.

140
00:16:06,102 --> 00:16:07,797
I don't give a damn.

141
00:16:07,904 --> 00:16:09,895
You and Evald must make
the best of it."

142
00:16:10,006 --> 00:16:11,564
Did I say that?

143
00:16:11,675 --> 00:16:14,940
- Not only that.
- Oh, no.

144
00:16:15,045 --> 00:16:16,740
These were your very words:

145
00:16:17,647 --> 00:16:19,979
"I have no respect
for mental suffering,

146
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:22,017
so don't come lamenting to me.

147
00:16:22,852 --> 00:16:27,551
If you need therapy,
you'd better see a shrink.

148
00:16:27,657 --> 00:16:31,252
Or why not a minister?
It's in fashion now."

149
00:16:31,361 --> 00:16:33,090
Did I say that?

150
00:16:33,763 --> 00:16:36,789
Your judgments are very categorical,
Uncle Isak.

151
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:40,301
I should hate to depend on you.

152
00:16:44,641 --> 00:16:48,634
I have liked having you
about the house.

153
00:16:48,745 --> 00:16:50,440
Like a cat.

154
00:16:50,547 --> 00:16:52,913
A cat or a human being.

155
00:16:53,016 --> 00:16:58,249
You're a fine young woman,
and I'm sorry you dislike me.

156
00:16:58,354 --> 00:17:01,016
- I don't dislike you.
- Really?

157
00:17:01,124 --> 00:17:03,354
- I feel sorry for you.
- Sorry?

158
00:17:08,064 --> 00:17:12,091
I'd like to tell you about a dream
I had this morning.

159
00:17:12,202 --> 00:17:14,500
I'm not very interested in dreams.

160
00:17:14,604 --> 00:17:18,472
No. No, of course not.

161
00:17:31,654 --> 00:17:33,645
Where are you going now?

162
00:17:33,757 --> 00:17:36,317
I want to show you something.

163
00:18:09,292 --> 00:18:14,821
We lived here every summer
during the first 20 years of my life.

164
00:18:14,931 --> 00:18:18,492
There were ten of us children.
Perhaps you knew that.

165
00:18:20,003 --> 00:18:21,493
Does anyone live here now?

166
00:18:21,604 --> 00:18:23,333
No, not this summer.

167
00:18:27,443 --> 00:18:30,139
I'll go swimming, if you don't mind.
We have plenty of time.

168
00:18:30,246 --> 00:18:31,770
Yes, by all means, do.

169
00:18:44,794 --> 00:18:47,661
The place where
wild strawberries grow!

170
00:18:59,909 --> 00:19:03,743
Perhaps I got a little sentimental.

171
00:19:04,981 --> 00:19:07,711
Perhaps I got a little tired

172
00:19:07,817 --> 00:19:10,411
and felt a bit sad.

173
00:19:12,055 --> 00:19:17,357
It's not impossible that I began
to think of this and that,

174
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:21,123
associated with places
where I played as a child.

175
00:19:22,465 --> 00:19:24,899
I don't know how it happened,

176
00:19:25,935 --> 00:19:28,426
but the day's clear reality

177
00:19:28,538 --> 00:19:33,703
dissolved into the even clearer
images of memory

178
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:36,301
that appeared before my eyes

179
00:19:36,412 --> 00:19:39,279
with the strength
of a true stream of events.

180
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,561
Sara.

181
00:20:00,603 --> 00:20:02,298
Sara,

182
00:20:03,006 --> 00:20:05,372
it's your cousin Isak.

183
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:12,104
Well, I've become quite old,
of course, so I don't look the same.

184
00:20:13,182 --> 00:20:18,916
But you, you haven't changed at all.

185
00:20:24,827 --> 00:20:27,762
Good morning, sweet cousin.
What are you doing?

186
00:20:27,864 --> 00:20:30,059
Picking strawberries, silly.
Can't you see?

187
00:20:31,034 --> 00:20:33,662
And who shall be favored
with these delicious berries

188
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:37,536
picked in the early morn
by a lovely young woman?

189
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:41,041
Nonsense. You know quite well
that it's Uncle Aron's name day today.

190
00:20:41,144 --> 00:20:43,510
I forgot to make a present.

191
00:20:43,613 --> 00:20:46,241
So he'll get a basket
of wild strawberries instead.

192
00:20:46,349 --> 00:20:47,509
I'll help you.

193
00:20:47,617 --> 00:20:51,144
You see, Sigbritt and Charlotta made
a tapestry and Angelica baked a cake,

194
00:20:51,254 --> 00:20:52,983
and Anna has painted
a really good picture,

195
00:20:53,089 --> 00:20:56,115
and Kristina and Birgitta
wrote a song that they'll sing to him.

196
00:20:56,225 --> 00:20:59,251
That's the best one.
Uncle Aron is stone-deaf.

197
00:20:59,362 --> 00:21:02,195
He'll be very pleased,
and you're stupid.

198
00:21:02,298 --> 00:21:04,732
And you have a darned cute nape.

199
00:21:07,203 --> 00:21:08,727
You know you shouldn't do that.

200
00:21:08,838 --> 00:21:11,329
- Says who?
- I say.

201
00:21:11,441 --> 00:21:14,137
Besides, you're an unusually
insufferable young man

202
00:21:14,243 --> 00:21:15,904
who thinks he's really something.

203
00:21:16,012 --> 00:21:18,344
I'm your cousin,
and you're in love with me.

204
00:21:19,282 --> 00:21:20,510
With you!

205
00:21:22,051 --> 00:21:23,609
Come and be kissed on the lips.

206
00:21:24,821 --> 00:21:28,917
If you don't behave, I'll tell Isak
you're always trying to kiss me.

207
00:21:29,025 --> 00:21:32,552
Little Isak! I could beat him up
with one arm.

208
00:21:33,229 --> 00:21:36,027
You know quite well that Isak and I
are secretly engaged.

209
00:21:36,132 --> 00:21:39,829
So secretly, everyone knows it.

210
00:21:39,936 --> 00:21:42,962
It's not my fault that the twins
let the cat out of the bag.

211
00:21:43,072 --> 00:21:47,065
When is the wedding?
When is the wedding?

212
00:21:48,111 --> 00:21:53,048
I don't know which of you four brothers
is the least conceited,

213
00:21:53,149 --> 00:21:55,515
but I think it's Isak.

214
00:21:55,618 --> 00:21:57,176
Isak is the nicest, anyway.

215
00:21:57,286 --> 00:21:59,948
And you're the most horrid, nastiest,

216
00:22:00,056 --> 00:22:04,925
silliest, stupidest...
I can't find the words to describe you!

217
00:22:05,028 --> 00:22:08,122
Admit you've got
a weak spot for me.

218
00:22:08,231 --> 00:22:10,597
And you reek of cigars.

219
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,463
It's a nice manly smell.

220
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:18,497
And the twins,
who know most things,

221
00:22:18,608 --> 00:22:23,443
say you've been up to no good
with that Berglund girl.

222
00:22:23,546 --> 00:22:28,916
She's not a nice girl, the twins say.
And I agree.

223
00:22:29,018 --> 00:22:32,385
How pretty you are
when you blush.

224
00:22:32,488 --> 00:22:35,753
You must kiss me.
I can't bear it any longer.

225
00:22:35,858 --> 00:22:40,227
Now that I think of it,
I'm madly in love with you.

226
00:22:40,329 --> 00:22:42,524
- You're just saying that.
- No.

227
00:22:44,834 --> 00:22:47,530
And the twins say

228
00:22:47,637 --> 00:22:50,765
that you're mad about girls.

229
00:22:50,973 --> 00:22:52,600
Is that true?

230
00:23:02,418 --> 00:23:05,046
Oh, look what you've done!

231
00:23:06,189 --> 00:23:10,421
And what will Isak say,
who really loves me?

232
00:23:11,594 --> 00:23:16,088
I'm so sad!
You've hurt me so!

233
00:23:17,767 --> 00:23:20,201
You've made
a bad woman of me.

234
00:23:20,303 --> 00:23:22,328
At any rate, nearly.

235
00:23:22,438 --> 00:23:25,999
I never want to see you again,
at least not before brunch.

236
00:23:26,442 --> 00:23:29,934
I have to hurry.
Help me pick up the strawberries.

237
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,610
Oh, and now I've got
a stain on my apron!

238
00:24:03,012 --> 00:24:06,573
Where's Isak?

239
00:24:07,283 --> 00:24:12,084
Out fishing with Papa,
and they can't hear the gong.

240
00:24:12,188 --> 00:24:18,149
Anyway, Papa said
not to wait with brunch.

241
00:25:08,044 --> 00:25:10,239
In Jesus' name
we take our seat.

242
00:25:10,346 --> 00:25:13,782
Bless, O Lord,
this food we eat. Amen.

243
00:25:22,625 --> 00:25:25,753
Benjamin, go and wash
your hands at once.

244
00:25:25,861 --> 00:25:28,762
How old do you have to be
to learn cleanliness?

245
00:25:28,864 --> 00:25:30,388
I have.

246
00:25:31,234 --> 00:25:34,931
Sigbritt, pass Angelica the porridge.

247
00:25:35,037 --> 00:25:38,404
Your fingernails are filthy.

248
00:25:39,375 --> 00:25:40,774
Hagbart, pass the bread.

249
00:25:42,812 --> 00:25:45,940
Don't take so much butter.

250
00:25:46,048 --> 00:25:50,041
Charlotta, the salt is lumpy.
You let it get damp.

251
00:25:50,152 --> 00:25:52,245
How often have I told you
not to let it sit out?

252
00:25:52,355 --> 00:25:55,620
It's paint under my nails.

253
00:25:55,725 --> 00:25:57,522
Who gathered
the wild strawberries for me?

254
00:25:57,627 --> 00:26:00,118
- I did.
- What?

255
00:26:01,631 --> 00:26:05,294
Speak up, dear.
Uncle Aron can't hear.

256
00:26:05,401 --> 00:26:08,234
I did!

257
00:26:08,337 --> 00:26:11,966
Fancy your remembering
my name day.

258
00:26:12,074 --> 00:26:14,304
How kind of you.

259
00:26:15,077 --> 00:26:19,309
Couldn't Uncle have a drink
to celebrate?

260
00:26:19,415 --> 00:26:22,111
Never when Papa is not at home.

261
00:26:22,885 --> 00:26:26,218
Uncle has already had three drinks.

262
00:26:26,322 --> 00:26:30,224
We saw him when we went out
to bathe at 8:00.

263
00:26:30,326 --> 00:26:32,624
So you've picked berries too.
Thank you.

264
00:26:32,728 --> 00:26:35,526
Twins, speak when spoken to.

265
00:26:37,133 --> 00:26:40,591
And as you didn't make your beds,
you can dry the silver.

266
00:26:42,004 --> 00:26:44,837
You will do as Auntie says.

267
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:47,636
Benjamin, don't bite your nails.

268
00:26:47,743 --> 00:26:51,270
Anna, what are you doing?
Remember you're not a little girl anymore.

269
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:53,280
I want to give Uncle my picture.

270
00:26:53,382 --> 00:26:56,146
Please, Auntie, can't we give him
our presents now?

271
00:26:56,252 --> 00:26:58,015
- Where is your present?
- Under the table.

272
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,815
No, after we've eaten.

273
00:27:01,123 --> 00:27:05,856
A very advanced work of art:
Fritjof and Ingeborg.

274
00:27:05,961 --> 00:27:09,829
You can't tell which is Fritjof!

275
00:27:09,932 --> 00:27:15,199
What were Sara and Sigfrid doing
in the wild strawberry patch?

276
00:27:15,304 --> 00:27:18,171
We saw you! We saw you!

277
00:27:18,274 --> 00:27:20,936
The twins ought to be muzzled.

278
00:27:21,043 --> 00:27:23,136
The twins will be quiet
or leave the table.

279
00:27:23,245 --> 00:27:24,769
No freedom of speech, eh?

280
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,780
Shut up, you brats.

281
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:30,942
Sara's blushing! Sara's blushing!

282
00:27:31,987 --> 00:27:35,013
Sigfrid is blushing too!
Sigfrid and Sara! Sigfrid and Sara!

283
00:27:35,124 --> 00:27:36,989
Quiet, everybody!

284
00:27:40,463 --> 00:27:41,953
But Sara!

285
00:27:42,064 --> 00:27:44,032
They're lying! They're lying!

286
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:15,720
Isak is so fine and good,

287
00:28:16,932 --> 00:28:21,130
so moral and sensitive.

288
00:28:21,237 --> 00:28:24,365
He wants us to read poetry

289
00:28:24,907 --> 00:28:27,205
and talk about the next life

290
00:28:27,309 --> 00:28:30,870
and play four-handed piano.

291
00:28:32,581 --> 00:28:35,982
And he only wants to kiss
in the dark,

292
00:28:37,219 --> 00:28:39,881
and he talks about sin.

293
00:28:39,989 --> 00:28:42,651
He's on such a terribly high level,

294
00:28:43,993 --> 00:28:46,484
and I feel so worthless.

295
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:51,727
And I am worthless...
there's no denying it.

296
00:28:55,237 --> 00:28:58,866
But sometimes it seems to me
that I'm a lot older than Isak,

297
00:28:58,974 --> 00:29:01,238
if you know what I mean.

298
00:29:01,343 --> 00:29:05,905
And then I think he's a child,
although we're the same age.

299
00:29:07,082 --> 00:29:12,418
And Sigfrid is so bold and exciting,
and I want to go home.

300
00:29:12,521 --> 00:29:14,682
I don't want to be here all summer

301
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:17,315
and be an object of ridicule
for the twins and all of you.

302
00:29:17,426 --> 00:29:19,417
I don't want to!

303
00:29:19,528 --> 00:29:21,758
I'll speak to Sigfrid.

304
00:29:21,864 --> 00:29:23,331
If he doesn't behave,

305
00:29:23,432 --> 00:29:25,866
I'll make sure he's made to study
during the summer holidays.

306
00:29:25,968 --> 00:29:27,629
Papa will fix that
as easy as anything.

307
00:29:27,736 --> 00:29:30,671
He too thinks Sigfrid is a
good-for-nothing and needs to work.

308
00:29:30,773 --> 00:29:34,265
Poor little Isak
who's so good to me.

309
00:29:35,578 --> 00:29:38,138
How unfair everything is.

310
00:29:39,782 --> 00:29:41,943
All will be well, you'll see.

311
00:29:42,051 --> 00:29:45,111
Listen, now they're singing
for Uncle Aron.

312
00:29:46,422 --> 00:29:51,724
How silly to write a song
for a deaf old man.

313
00:29:51,827 --> 00:29:53,454
How typical of the twins.

314
00:29:53,562 --> 00:29:58,465
Flowers nod, grasses bow

315
00:29:58,567 --> 00:30:04,028
Around our lovely house

316
00:30:04,139 --> 00:30:09,702
We our Uncle Aron celebrate

317
00:30:09,812 --> 00:30:11,780
And with our song

318
00:30:11,881 --> 00:30:16,250
Ornament his brow

319
00:30:16,952 --> 00:30:20,649
Four cheers for Uncle Aron.

320
00:30:20,756 --> 00:30:24,852
Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah!

321
00:30:32,134 --> 00:30:34,466
I'll run down and meet
Isak and Uncle.

322
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:36,060
You do that.

323
00:30:36,972 --> 00:30:42,501
I was overwhelmed by feelings
of emptiness and sadness,

324
00:30:42,878 --> 00:30:46,575
but was soon awakened
from my reveries

325
00:30:47,716 --> 00:30:51,117
by the voice of a young girl
asking me repeatedly about something.

326
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,051
Is this your house?

327
00:30:53,155 --> 00:30:55,248
No, it's not.

328
00:30:55,357 --> 00:30:57,689
You're lucky to be telling the truth.

329
00:30:57,793 --> 00:31:00,626
It's my dad who owns the whole
headland, including the house.

330
00:31:00,729 --> 00:31:04,631
I lived here once.
Two hundred years ago.

331
00:31:04,733 --> 00:31:07,031
Oh, yeah?

332
00:31:07,436 --> 00:31:10,667
- Is that your car up at the gate?
- Yes, that's my car.

333
00:31:10,773 --> 00:31:11,899
Looks antique.

334
00:31:12,007 --> 00:31:14,840
Yes, it's antique, like its owner.

335
00:31:15,611 --> 00:31:19,980
So you have self-irony too.
That's fantastic.

336
00:31:20,082 --> 00:31:22,107
Where are you going?
I mean, in which direction?

337
00:31:22,217 --> 00:31:24,048
Well, I'm going to Lund.

338
00:31:24,153 --> 00:31:26,781
But that suits me perfectly.
You see, I'm on my way to Italy.

339
00:31:26,889 --> 00:31:29,619
I'm honored.

340
00:31:29,725 --> 00:31:32,057
My name's Sara.
Silly name, isn't it?

341
00:31:32,161 --> 00:31:35,494
My name's Isak.
It's silly too.

342
00:31:35,598 --> 00:31:36,860
Weren't they married?

343
00:31:36,966 --> 00:31:41,801
No, unfortunately.
That was Abraham and Sara.

344
00:31:41,904 --> 00:31:43,030
Let's leave, then.

345
00:31:43,138 --> 00:31:46,972
I have another lady with me.
Here she comes.

346
00:31:47,076 --> 00:31:49,943
- Marianne, this is Sara.
- Hello.

347
00:31:50,045 --> 00:31:52,013
We're going to have company
as far as Lund.

348
00:31:52,114 --> 00:31:56,073
Sara's off to Italy, but she's promised
to ride a ways with us.

349
00:31:56,185 --> 00:31:59,348
Ironic again, but it suits you.

350
00:32:00,155 --> 00:32:01,645
Let's be off.

351
00:32:06,495 --> 00:32:09,658
Hey, guys, I've got a lift
almost to Italy.

352
00:32:09,765 --> 00:32:15,726
That's Anders and that's Viktor
and this is Father Isak.

353
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:21,541
That peach you're gaping at
is Marianne.

354
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,807
What a big bus.

355
00:32:26,915 --> 00:32:28,849
Yes, there's room for us all.

356
00:32:28,951 --> 00:32:33,081
Put your luggage in the trunk,
if you don't mind.

357
00:32:48,504 --> 00:32:52,440
I must tell you, Isak,
that Anders and I are going steady.

358
00:32:52,541 --> 00:32:54,304
We're crazy about each other.

359
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:57,676
Viktor's the cheaper one.
Daddy insisted.

360
00:32:59,014 --> 00:33:03,974
Viktor is in love with me too.

361
00:33:04,086 --> 00:33:06,953
It's a brilliant move of Daddy's.

362
00:33:07,056 --> 00:33:10,514
I may have to seduce Viktor
to get rid of him.

363
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:16,060
I'd better tell you I'm a virgin.
That's why I'm so cheeky.

364
00:33:16,165 --> 00:33:18,190
And I smoke a pipe.

365
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:23,397
Viktor says it's good for you.
He's crazy about anything healthy.

366
00:33:25,307 --> 00:33:28,242
I was once in love
with a woman called Sara.

367
00:33:28,343 --> 00:33:30,743
No! She was like me, wasn't she?

368
00:33:30,846 --> 00:33:33,747
She was, actually.

369
00:33:33,849 --> 00:33:35,407
What happened to her?

370
00:33:35,517 --> 00:33:39,886
She married my brother Sigfrid
and had six children.

371
00:33:39,988 --> 00:33:43,924
She's 75 now
and quite a beautiful old lady.

372
00:33:44,026 --> 00:33:46,654
I can't think of anything worse
than growing old.

373
00:33:48,063 --> 00:33:52,295
Oh, dear,
now I have put my foot in it.

374
00:34:35,793 --> 00:34:37,260
Are you all right?

375
00:34:37,362 --> 00:34:40,388
I have no excuse.
It's all our fault.

376
00:34:40,498 --> 00:34:46,459
My wife was driving.
Are you all right?

377
00:34:47,238 --> 00:34:52,733
The murderers must introduce
themselves! My name's Alman.

378
00:34:53,378 --> 00:34:56,313
That's my wife Berit.
You can see she has been an actress.

379
00:34:56,414 --> 00:34:59,281
That's the complication
we were discussing when...

380
00:34:59,384 --> 00:35:01,545
Come here, Berit,
and say you're sorry.

381
00:35:01,653 --> 00:35:05,316
I'm so sorry.
It was all my fault.

382
00:35:05,423 --> 00:35:09,757
I was just going to hit my husband
when that curve appeared.

383
00:35:09,861 --> 00:35:15,026
God punishes some people at once,
eh, you Catholic?

384
00:35:15,133 --> 00:35:18,125
Let's get your car upright.

385
00:35:18,236 --> 00:35:21,000
- Oh, never mind us. Please.
- Shut up, Sten.

386
00:35:21,105 --> 00:35:25,565
Some people are unselfish,
though you don't think so.

387
00:35:28,146 --> 00:35:32,412
My wife is a little nervous.
We've had a shock.

388
00:35:34,252 --> 00:35:39,087
Just look at him measuring
his strength with the youngsters,

389
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:44,958
straining his flabby muscles
to show off in front of that cute girl.

390
00:35:50,702 --> 00:35:54,001
Darling, you might have a stroke.

391
00:35:56,741 --> 00:35:59,107
My wife likes ridiculing me.

392
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:02,111
I let her.
It's psychotherapy.

393
00:37:05,777 --> 00:37:10,373
I never know whether my wife
is really crying or just play acting.

394
00:37:11,416 --> 00:37:13,384
I'll be damned if it isn't real.

395
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:19,053
It happens when you catch
a glimpse of death.

396
00:37:19,157 --> 00:37:21,182
Can't you shut up?

397
00:37:21,292 --> 00:37:24,022
My wife can really live a part.

398
00:37:24,862 --> 00:37:28,354
For two years,
she made me think she had cancer

399
00:37:28,466 --> 00:37:32,027
and plagued us
with every possible symptom,

400
00:37:32,136 --> 00:37:34,969
even though the doctors
could find nothing wrong with her.

401
00:37:35,073 --> 00:37:40,841
Eventually we believed her
more than the doctors!

402
00:37:40,945 --> 00:37:43,140
It's natural that you're upset,

403
00:37:43,247 --> 00:37:45,681
but why not leave your wife
in peace for a while?

404
00:37:45,783 --> 00:37:48,149
A woman has a right
to her tears, eh?

405
00:37:48,252 --> 00:37:51,380
Don't get in the way
of a woman's tears.

406
00:37:52,824 --> 00:37:57,523
You are beautiful,
but old Berit's a bit past her prime.

407
00:37:57,628 --> 00:37:59,323
So you can afford to defend her.

408
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:02,888
I sympathize with her.
For several reasons.

409
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,127
Very sarcastic!

410
00:38:05,236 --> 00:38:07,636
Yet you don't seem
in the least hysterical.

411
00:38:08,406 --> 00:38:11,807
But little Berit is.

412
00:38:12,176 --> 00:38:14,371
Do you know
what that means for me?

413
00:38:14,479 --> 00:38:16,276
I gather you're a Catholic.

414
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:18,814
Quite right.
That's how I stand it.

415
00:38:18,916 --> 00:38:21,248
We ridicule each other.

416
00:38:21,352 --> 00:38:23,616
She has her hysteria.
I have my Catholicism.

417
00:38:23,721 --> 00:38:26,952
So, you see,
we need each other.

418
00:38:27,058 --> 00:38:30,152
It's only egoism
that we haven't killed each other.

419
00:38:40,438 --> 00:38:42,463
There it came.

420
00:38:42,573 --> 00:38:45,804
That's what is called syncopes,
isn't it?

421
00:38:48,179 --> 00:38:50,477
Very funny.

422
00:38:53,951 --> 00:38:58,012
If I'd had a stopwatch,
I could have timed the explosion.

423
00:38:58,122 --> 00:39:01,285
Shut up! Shut up!

424
00:39:06,864 --> 00:39:10,061
This may be too blunt,

425
00:39:11,169 --> 00:39:14,900
but for the children's sake,
will you please get out.

426
00:39:24,448 --> 00:39:27,440
Forgive us, if you can.

427
00:39:57,949 --> 00:40:01,544
It was with mixed feelings
I saw this region again.

428
00:40:02,153 --> 00:40:04,883
I had my first practice here,

429
00:40:05,456 --> 00:40:09,620
and my old mother lives nearby.

430
00:40:19,971 --> 00:40:22,064
Hello there, Doctor.

431
00:40:23,474 --> 00:40:25,806
So you're in these parts again,
Doctor?

432
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:29,004
Shall I fill it up?
Pass me the key to the hood.

433
00:40:31,816 --> 00:40:34,307
Eva! Come here a moment!

434
00:40:36,387 --> 00:40:39,845
It's Dr. Borg in person.

435
00:40:40,725 --> 00:40:44,821
Mom and Dad and the whole countryside
still talk about him.

436
00:40:44,929 --> 00:40:47,159
The world's best doctor.

437
00:40:48,733 --> 00:40:52,430
Let's call the baby after him.

438
00:40:52,536 --> 00:40:55,869
Isak Akerman... not a bad name
for a prime minister.

439
00:40:55,973 --> 00:40:57,941
Suppose it's a girl.

440
00:40:58,042 --> 00:41:01,034
We only have boys.

441
00:41:07,418 --> 00:41:10,410
And how's your father these days?

442
00:41:10,521 --> 00:41:14,480
Oh, Dad's getting a bit decrepit.

443
00:41:14,592 --> 00:41:17,356
But Mom's as lively as a cricket.

444
00:41:18,529 --> 00:41:20,895
And you're going to see
your mother, Doctor?

445
00:41:22,033 --> 00:41:25,935
She's amazing.
She must be at least 95.

446
00:41:26,037 --> 00:41:28,528
- Ninety-six.
- Imagine that.

447
00:41:30,708 --> 00:41:32,300
What do I owe you?

448
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:35,573
- This is on Eva and me!
- Absolutely not!

449
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:39,548
Don't insult us, Doctor.
We can do the proper thing too!

450
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:44,212
Why should you pay
for my gasoline?

451
00:41:44,322 --> 00:41:48,088
There are things
that can't be paid back...

452
00:41:48,225 --> 00:41:49,852
not even with gas.

453
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:52,428
We haven't forgotten.

454
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:56,296
Ask anyone around here.

455
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,369
They all remember your kindness.

456
00:42:01,439 --> 00:42:04,670
Maybe I should have stayed here.

457
00:42:04,775 --> 00:42:06,367
What do you mean?

458
00:42:09,613 --> 00:42:12,377
You said you should have stayed.

459
00:42:12,483 --> 00:42:14,678
Did I?

460
00:42:14,785 --> 00:42:18,277
Well, thanks anyway.

461
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:24,120
Let me know when the new son arrives,
and I'll be the godfather.

462
00:42:24,228 --> 00:42:26,128
You know where to find me.

463
00:42:47,351 --> 00:42:52,254
During lunch I was in good spirits

464
00:42:52,356 --> 00:42:56,816
and told the young people about
my years as district medical officer.

465
00:42:56,927 --> 00:42:59,555
My stories were quite a success,

466
00:42:59,663 --> 00:43:02,928
and I don't think they laughed
merely out of courtesy.

467
00:43:03,501 --> 00:43:07,961
I had wine with the lunch,
and then port with the coffee.

468
00:43:12,143 --> 00:43:17,740
Ah, when creation shows
so much beauty,

469
00:43:18,616 --> 00:43:21,915
how radiant must be its source!

470
00:43:22,019 --> 00:43:24,180
He is going to be a minister,
and Viktor a doctor.

471
00:43:24,288 --> 00:43:26,449
Reciting poetry
is against our agreement

472
00:43:26,557 --> 00:43:30,926
not to discuss God
or science on this trip.

473
00:43:31,028 --> 00:43:32,256
It was beautiful!

474
00:43:32,363 --> 00:43:36,766
How can anyone today
study to become a minister!

475
00:43:36,867 --> 00:43:41,270
Your rationalism is as dry as dust.

476
00:43:41,372 --> 00:43:43,101
I say that modern man...

477
00:43:43,207 --> 00:43:44,970
I say that...

478
00:43:45,075 --> 00:43:50,240
believes only in himself

479
00:43:50,347 --> 00:43:51,974
and his biological death.

480
00:43:52,082 --> 00:43:54,846
Modern man is a figment
of your imagination.

481
00:43:54,952 --> 00:43:58,547
Man regards death with horror.

482
00:43:58,656 --> 00:44:02,922
Religion for the people.
Opium for the aching limb.

483
00:44:03,027 --> 00:44:04,585
How sweet they both are!

484
00:44:04,695 --> 00:44:06,720
I always agree with the one
I spoke with last.

485
00:44:06,831 --> 00:44:09,732
Once you believed in Santa Claus...
now in God.

486
00:44:09,834 --> 00:44:13,292
You never had any imagination!

487
00:44:13,404 --> 00:44:15,895
What do you say, Professor?

488
00:44:16,006 --> 00:44:21,808
Whatever I said
would be met with tolerant irony,

489
00:44:21,912 --> 00:44:23,436
so I'll say nothing.

490
00:44:23,547 --> 00:44:25,447
I'm sure they'll be disappointed.

491
00:44:25,549 --> 00:44:29,246
No, Sara. Very, very happy.

492
00:44:31,322 --> 00:44:34,814
"Where is the friend I seek

493
00:44:34,925 --> 00:44:40,625
at break of day?

494
00:44:40,731 --> 00:44:44,690
When night falls, when..."

495
00:44:44,802 --> 00:44:48,101
"When night falls,
I still have not found Him."

496
00:44:48,205 --> 00:44:51,971
"My burning heart
shows me His traces..."

497
00:44:52,076 --> 00:44:54,010
Are you religious, Professor?

498
00:44:56,213 --> 00:45:00,309
"I see His traces

499
00:45:00,417 --> 00:45:05,184
wherever flowers bloom.

500
00:45:10,327 --> 00:45:15,594
His love is mingled with every air."

501
00:45:16,534 --> 00:45:19,503
"His voice calls
in the summer wind."

502
00:45:19,603 --> 00:45:22,697
Not bad for a love poem.

503
00:45:23,607 --> 00:45:27,873
I've gone all solemn again
for no reason.

504
00:45:29,113 --> 00:45:34,244
Well, I'm going to call on my mother.
I'll be back soon.

505
00:45:34,351 --> 00:45:37,047
- May I come?
- Of course.

506
00:45:48,766 --> 00:45:51,132
Here comes the thunder.

507
00:45:57,675 --> 00:46:02,112
I have just sent you a telegram

508
00:46:02,212 --> 00:46:05,272
on your great day.

509
00:46:05,549 --> 00:46:07,073
And now you're here.

510
00:46:07,184 --> 00:46:10,676
We all have our bright moments,
dear Mother.

511
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:15,954
Is that your wife over there?

512
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:19,120
I don't want to talk to her.

513
00:46:19,797 --> 00:46:22,197
She has done us too much harm.

514
00:46:22,299 --> 00:46:25,029
No, Mother dear.

515
00:46:25,135 --> 00:46:29,731
This is Evald's wife, Marianne.

516
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:32,866
Well, let her come
and say hello to me.

517
00:46:35,179 --> 00:46:37,113
Good day, Mrs. Borg.

518
00:46:37,414 --> 00:46:40,747
And why are you
gadding about like this?

519
00:46:40,851 --> 00:46:42,842
I have been in Stockholm for a visit.

520
00:46:42,953 --> 00:46:47,083
Why aren't you with Evald
and the child?

521
00:46:47,191 --> 00:46:50,092
Evald and I have no children.

522
00:46:50,194 --> 00:46:55,291
These young people nowadays!
I bore ten children.

523
00:46:56,967 --> 00:47:02,735
Will you please hand me
that big box over there.

524
00:47:04,775 --> 00:47:07,676
My mother lived in this house.

525
00:47:07,778 --> 00:47:11,407
Do you remember
coming to see her, Isak?

526
00:47:11,515 --> 00:47:13,380
Very well.

527
00:47:13,484 --> 00:47:17,511
Here are some of your toys.

528
00:47:17,621 --> 00:47:22,524
I have been trying to think
which of you owned what.

529
00:47:22,626 --> 00:47:26,357
Ten children,
and all dead except Isak.

530
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:28,590
Twenty grandchildren.

531
00:47:28,699 --> 00:47:31,634
Evald's the only one
who comes to see me.

532
00:47:31,735 --> 00:47:34,465
Don't get me wrong...
I'm not complaining.

533
00:47:35,339 --> 00:47:38,570
Fifteen great-grandchildren
whom I have never seen.

534
00:47:38,676 --> 00:47:44,410
I send presents
for all their birthdays.

535
00:47:44,515 --> 00:47:50,351
I get letters of thanks,
but nobody bothers to visit me

536
00:47:50,454 --> 00:47:53,981
unless they want to borrow money.

537
00:47:54,091 --> 00:47:57,254
Oh, I know I'm tiresome.

538
00:47:57,361 --> 00:47:59,886
Don't think that, Mother.

539
00:47:59,997 --> 00:48:02,124
And I've one more fault.

540
00:48:02,666 --> 00:48:04,634
I don't die.

541
00:48:04,735 --> 00:48:08,364
The inheritance
isn't being divided up

542
00:48:08,472 --> 00:48:11,498
the way these crafty young people
had planned.

543
00:48:12,676 --> 00:48:16,077
This was Sigbritt's doll.

544
00:48:16,346 --> 00:48:19,406
She got it when she turned eight.

545
00:48:19,583 --> 00:48:22,245
I made the dress myself.

546
00:48:22,352 --> 00:48:24,718
But she never cared for it

547
00:48:24,822 --> 00:48:26,756
so it went to Charlotta.

548
00:48:26,857 --> 00:48:30,418
She took care of it...
I remember it clearly.

549
00:48:32,196 --> 00:48:33,959
Do you see who that is?

550
00:48:34,064 --> 00:48:37,363
Sigfrid was three
and you were five.

551
00:48:38,068 --> 00:48:41,504
And myself.

552
00:48:41,605 --> 00:48:44,039
What a fright
one looked in those days.

553
00:48:45,075 --> 00:48:46,542
May I have it?

554
00:48:46,643 --> 00:48:49,168
By all means.
It's only rubbish.

555
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:52,011
And here's a coloring book.

556
00:48:52,116 --> 00:48:57,748
I don't know whose it was.

557
00:48:57,855 --> 00:49:00,415
They've all put their names in it.

558
00:49:01,492 --> 00:49:03,460
Kristina has scrawled:

559
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:08,520
"I love Papa more than
anything in the whole world."

560
00:49:09,767 --> 00:49:14,795
And Birgitta has put:
"I'm going to marry Papa."

561
00:49:15,806 --> 00:49:20,209
Isn't that funny?
I laughed when I saw it.

562
00:49:21,245 --> 00:49:25,375
Don't you think it's cold in here?

563
00:49:25,482 --> 00:49:28,110
No, not particularly.

564
00:49:28,218 --> 00:49:31,881
I have felt cold all my life.

565
00:49:31,989 --> 00:49:35,447
Mostly my stomach.
I wonder why.

566
00:49:35,559 --> 00:49:38,392
You have low blood pressure.

567
00:49:38,495 --> 00:49:43,364
Let us have some tea,
and we can sit and talk.

568
00:49:43,467 --> 00:49:46,630
No, thank you, Mother.
We won't disturb you any longer.

569
00:49:50,841 --> 00:49:53,810
Sigbritt's eldest boy
will soon be 50.

570
00:49:53,911 --> 00:49:57,005
I thought of giving him
Father's gold watch.

571
00:49:57,114 --> 00:50:01,016
It has no hands.
Does that matter?

572
00:50:10,961 --> 00:50:15,261
I remember when Sigbritt's boy
was a newborn.

573
00:50:15,365 --> 00:50:20,769
He used to lie in the lilac arbor
at the summer house.

574
00:50:20,871 --> 00:50:23,931
Now he's turning 50.

575
00:50:25,042 --> 00:50:30,537
And little cousin Sara used to
carry him around and sing to him.

576
00:50:30,647 --> 00:50:33,411
She married Sigfrid,
that good-for-nothing.

577
00:50:34,384 --> 00:50:39,845
Well, you must go now,
or you'll be late for the ceremony.

578
00:50:39,957 --> 00:50:45,020
I am very glad you came,
and I hope to see you again.

579
00:50:45,128 --> 00:50:48,620
Give my love to Evald.
Good-bye.

580
00:51:15,325 --> 00:51:17,725
Where are Anders and Viktor?

581
00:51:17,828 --> 00:51:23,460
They started arguing about God,
and then they lost their tempers.

582
00:51:23,901 --> 00:51:27,029
And Anders tried
to twist Viktor's arm,

583
00:51:27,137 --> 00:51:31,073
and Viktor said that was
a lousy argument for God's existence.

584
00:51:31,174 --> 00:51:34,803
I said they could talk
about me instead.

585
00:51:34,912 --> 00:51:39,611
Then they told me to shut up
because I didn't understand the debate,

586
00:51:39,716 --> 00:51:41,183
so I left.

587
00:51:41,285 --> 00:51:45,415
They went up the hill to fight it out
because each insisted...

588
00:51:45,522 --> 00:51:48,457
the other had hurt
his innermost feelings.

589
00:51:48,558 --> 00:51:50,788
- Where are they now?
- Up there.

590
00:51:54,898 --> 00:51:56,525
I'll see to them.

591
00:51:56,633 --> 00:51:59,067
Which one do you like best?

592
00:51:59,436 --> 00:52:01,666
Which one do you like best?

593
00:52:01,772 --> 00:52:05,139
I don't know.
Anders is going to be a minister...

594
00:52:05,242 --> 00:52:07,267
He's a darling.

595
00:52:08,211 --> 00:52:10,236
But a minister's wife...

596
00:52:10,347 --> 00:52:13,316
Viktor's nice too.
In a different way.

597
00:52:13,417 --> 00:52:16,853
- Viktor will go far, of course.
- What do you mean?

598
00:52:16,954 --> 00:52:22,187
A doctor earns more money.
And ministers are out of date.

599
00:52:22,292 --> 00:52:25,989
Though he has got nice legs
and a sweet neck.

600
00:52:27,230 --> 00:52:29,164
But how can anyone believe in God?

601
00:52:42,813 --> 00:52:45,407
Well? Does God exist?

602
00:53:09,106 --> 00:53:14,544
I dozed off,
but was haunted by vivid

603
00:53:14,644 --> 00:53:20,241
and humiliating dreams.

604
00:53:21,184 --> 00:53:27,521
There was something overpowering
in these dream images

605
00:53:27,624 --> 00:53:33,563
that bored relentlessly into my mind.

606
00:53:44,274 --> 00:53:46,265
Have you looked in the mirror, Isak?

607
00:53:49,413 --> 00:53:51,404
Then I'll show you
what you look like.

608
00:53:53,417 --> 00:53:56,716
You're a worried old man
who's soon going to die,

609
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:59,516
but I have all my life before me.

610
00:54:01,091 --> 00:54:03,525
That hurt your feelings, after all.

611
00:54:04,461 --> 00:54:07,726
No, it didn't hurt.

612
00:54:07,831 --> 00:54:12,928
Yes, it hurt
because you can't bear the truth.

613
00:54:13,970 --> 00:54:17,497
The truth is that
I've been too considerate.

614
00:54:18,108 --> 00:54:20,269
And so became unintentionally cruel.

615
00:54:23,413 --> 00:54:24,505
I understand.

616
00:54:24,614 --> 00:54:29,551
No, you don't understand.
We don't speak the same language.

617
00:54:30,787 --> 00:54:32,516
Look in the mirror again.

618
00:54:32,622 --> 00:54:34,647
No, don't turn away.

619
00:54:35,258 --> 00:54:36,816
I see.

620
00:54:37,427 --> 00:54:39,088
Listen to me.

621
00:54:40,297 --> 00:54:43,528
I'm going to marry
your brother Sigfrid.

622
00:54:44,367 --> 00:54:48,497
Love is almost a game for us.

623
00:54:50,207 --> 00:54:54,644
Look at your face now.
Try to smile!

624
00:54:56,313 --> 00:54:58,907
There! Now you're smiling.

625
00:55:01,017 --> 00:55:03,042
But it hurts so.

626
00:55:03,553 --> 00:55:08,490
As professor emerit us,
you ought to know why it hurts.

627
00:55:08,592 --> 00:55:10,150
But you don't know.

628
00:55:11,294 --> 00:55:15,230
You know so much,
and you don't know anything.

629
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:18,827
I must go.

630
00:55:18,935 --> 00:55:22,462
I promised to keep an eye
on Sigbritt's baby.

631
00:55:51,201 --> 00:55:53,431
Poor little thing.

632
00:55:54,137 --> 00:55:56,901
Hush, baby. Sleep.

633
00:55:58,175 --> 00:55:59,972
Don't be afraid of the wind

634
00:56:01,044 --> 00:56:05,879
or the birds

635
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:09,685
or the waves of the sea.

636
00:56:10,387 --> 00:56:13,720
I'm here with you,
holding you tight.

637
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:16,348
Don't be afraid, little one.

638
00:56:17,727 --> 00:56:19,888
It will soon be day again.

639
00:56:20,931 --> 00:56:22,899
No one will hurt you.

640
00:56:22,999 --> 00:56:26,162
I am with you.
I am holding you.

641
00:59:34,224 --> 00:59:36,317
Please come in, Professor Borg.

642
01:00:54,637 --> 01:00:56,662
Have you brought
your examination book?

643
01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:07,809
Please identify the bacterial specimen
under the microscope.

644
01:01:19,262 --> 01:01:21,321
There must be something wrong.

645
01:01:25,568 --> 01:01:27,058
Not with the microscope.

646
01:01:27,170 --> 01:01:30,469
I can't see a thing.

647
01:01:31,508 --> 01:01:34,238
Please read this text.

648
01:01:49,158 --> 01:01:50,591
What does it mean?

649
01:01:52,328 --> 01:01:54,091
I don't know.

650
01:01:55,732 --> 01:01:56,824
Really?

651
01:01:56,933 --> 01:02:00,733
I'm a doctor, not a linguist.

652
01:02:01,804 --> 01:02:07,538
What you see on the blackboard
is a doctor's first duty.

653
01:02:08,678 --> 01:02:11,579
Don't you know what that is?

654
01:02:14,384 --> 01:02:16,181
Let me think.

655
01:02:16,286 --> 01:02:17,913
Take your time.

656
01:02:19,923 --> 01:02:24,053
A doctor's first duty...

657
01:02:24,527 --> 01:02:26,256
A doctor's...

658
01:02:27,931 --> 01:02:29,364
I've forgotten.

659
01:02:29,465 --> 01:02:33,697
A doctor's first duty
is to ask for forgiveness.

660
01:02:34,404 --> 01:02:38,807
Of course! Now I remember!

661
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:53,182
You have been accused of guilt.

662
01:02:56,359 --> 01:02:59,624
I'll make a note that you haven't
understood the charge.

663
01:03:02,799 --> 01:03:04,767
Is it serious?

664
01:03:05,501 --> 01:03:07,162
Unfortunately, Professor.

665
01:03:19,182 --> 01:03:20,843
I have a weak heart.

666
01:03:20,950 --> 01:03:23,214
I'm an old man.

667
01:03:23,319 --> 01:03:26,152
You must be lenient with me.
It's only fair.

668
01:03:26,589 --> 01:03:29,319
There's nothing about your heart
in my papers.

669
01:03:29,926 --> 01:03:31,325
Do you want to stop the examination?

670
01:03:31,427 --> 01:03:33,452
No, for God's sake, no!

671
01:03:40,970 --> 01:03:44,201
Please diagnose the patient.

672
01:03:58,054 --> 01:04:00,682
The patient is dead.

673
01:04:22,945 --> 01:04:25,140
What are you writing in my book?

674
01:04:25,248 --> 01:04:28,308
- My verdict.
- And that is?

675
01:04:28,751 --> 01:04:30,685
That you are incompetent.

676
01:04:34,090 --> 01:04:39,426
You are also accused of some minor
but still serious offenses.

677
01:04:40,063 --> 01:04:44,500
Callousness, selfishness,
ruthlessness.

678
01:04:45,334 --> 01:04:48,303
Your wife has made the charge.

679
01:04:48,404 --> 01:04:50,736
You'll be confronted with her.

680
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:53,331
But my wife has been dead for years!

681
01:04:53,443 --> 01:04:55,308
Do you think I'm joking?

682
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:00,041
Please come with me.

683
01:05:00,550 --> 01:05:02,643
You have no choice.

684
01:07:23,259 --> 01:07:26,251
Many forget a woman
who has been dead for 30 years.

685
01:07:26,929 --> 01:07:30,023
Some cherish
a sweet and fading picture,

686
01:07:30,967 --> 01:07:36,132
but you can recall this scene
at any time.

687
01:07:36,973 --> 01:07:39,669
Tuesday, May 1st, 1917.

688
01:07:40,943 --> 01:07:42,604
You stood on this very spot.

689
01:07:42,712 --> 01:07:47,149
and heard and saw what that man
and woman said and did.

690
01:08:02,164 --> 01:08:06,601
Now I'll go home and tell Isak.
I know just what he'll say.

691
01:08:06,702 --> 01:08:10,035
"My poor girl, I'm sorry for you."

692
01:08:11,908 --> 01:08:14,274
Just as if he were God.

693
01:08:15,912 --> 01:08:21,145
Then I'll weep and say,
"Do you really feel sorry for me?"

694
01:08:22,385 --> 01:08:26,822
He'll say, "Yes, very sorry."

695
01:08:27,423 --> 01:08:31,450
Then I'll weep even more
and ask him to forgive me.

696
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:32,754
He'll say,

697
01:08:32,862 --> 01:08:38,164
"You mustn't beg my forgiveness.
There is nothing to forgive."

698
01:08:40,937 --> 01:08:43,667
But he doesn't mean
a word he says

699
01:08:45,641 --> 01:08:47,905
because he's cold as ice.

700
01:08:49,812 --> 01:08:52,508
And suddenly he gets very tender,

701
01:08:54,050 --> 01:08:56,541
and I scream at him that he's mad

702
01:08:58,321 --> 01:09:01,586
and that his hypocrisy makes me sick.

703
01:09:02,625 --> 01:09:05,651
Then he says
he'll get me a sedative

704
01:09:05,761 --> 01:09:08,958
and that he understands
everything quite well.

705
01:09:10,166 --> 01:09:12,327
And I tell him it's his fault
that I am as I am.

706
01:09:14,770 --> 01:09:18,900
And he looks sad
and says it is his fault.

707
01:09:20,810 --> 01:09:23,108
But he doesn't really care
about anything

708
01:09:23,779 --> 01:09:25,747
because he's so cold.

709
01:09:49,739 --> 01:09:51,206
Where is she?

710
01:09:51,307 --> 01:09:55,767
Gone. All are gone.

711
01:09:55,878 --> 01:09:59,814
Removed by an operation,
Professor.

712
01:10:00,449 --> 01:10:04,078
A surgical masterpiece.
No pain.

713
01:10:04,186 --> 01:10:06,120
Nothing that bleeds or trembles.

714
01:10:07,023 --> 01:10:09,184
How silent it is.

715
01:10:10,192 --> 01:10:12,683
A perfect achievement
in its way, Professor.

716
01:10:13,729 --> 01:10:15,526
And the punishment?

717
01:10:15,631 --> 01:10:19,294
I don't know.
The usual, I suppose.

718
01:10:19,402 --> 01:10:20,960
The usual?

719
01:10:21,070 --> 01:10:22,970
Loneliness.

720
01:10:23,072 --> 01:10:25,370
Loneliness?

721
01:10:25,474 --> 01:10:28,307
Precisely.

722
01:10:29,045 --> 01:10:31,138
Is there no mercy?

723
01:10:31,247 --> 01:10:34,614
Don't ask me. I don't know.

724
01:10:54,837 --> 01:10:56,566
What's this?

725
01:10:57,406 --> 01:11:00,273
The children wanted
to stretch their legs.

726
01:11:00,376 --> 01:11:03,072
But it's still raining.

727
01:11:03,179 --> 01:11:07,843
I told them about today
and they want to honor you.

728
01:11:09,318 --> 01:11:10,342
Slept well?

729
01:11:10,453 --> 01:11:16,221
Yes, but recently I've had
the weirdest dreams,

730
01:11:21,063 --> 01:11:25,397
as if I must tell myself something
I won't listen to when I'm awake.

731
01:11:25,501 --> 01:11:26,832
What's that?

732
01:11:28,204 --> 01:11:31,332
That I'm dead.
Although I'm alive.

733
01:11:32,208 --> 01:11:34,699
You and Evald are very alike.

734
01:11:35,578 --> 01:11:37,239
So you've said.

735
01:11:37,346 --> 01:11:39,576
He said the same thing.

736
01:11:40,015 --> 01:11:42,040
About me?

737
01:11:42,151 --> 01:11:43,880
No. About himself.

738
01:11:43,986 --> 01:11:45,453
But he's only 38.

739
01:11:48,057 --> 01:11:50,548
May I tell you about it?

740
01:11:50,659 --> 01:11:54,595
Yes, I'd be grateful.

741
01:11:56,165 --> 01:12:00,534
A few months ago
I wanted to talk to Evald,

742
01:12:00,636 --> 01:12:02,729
so he drove me down to the sea.

743
01:12:02,838 --> 01:12:06,899
It was raining then too.
He sat where you sit now.

744
01:12:09,178 --> 01:12:13,547
Well, you've trapped me.
What do you want to say?

745
01:12:13,649 --> 01:12:15,879
Something unpleasant, of course.

746
01:12:17,253 --> 01:12:19,312
I wish I didn't have to.

747
01:12:19,421 --> 01:12:21,480
You have found someone else.

748
01:12:22,391 --> 01:12:24,222
Don't be childish.

749
01:12:24,326 --> 01:12:28,922
You tell me in funereal tones
that you must talk to me,

750
01:12:29,031 --> 01:12:32,762
and then you find it
hard to begin.

751
01:12:32,868 --> 01:12:38,807
Come on, for heaven's sake!
Don't keep me on tenterhooks!

752
01:12:38,908 --> 01:12:40,739
I almost want to laugh now.

753
01:12:40,843 --> 01:12:42,743
Whatever do you think
I'm going to tell you?

754
01:12:42,845 --> 01:12:47,043
That I've killed someone,
or stolen the faculty funds?

755
01:12:47,149 --> 01:12:48,776
I'm going to have a baby.

756
01:12:51,654 --> 01:12:53,178
Are you sure?

757
01:12:53,289 --> 01:12:55,689
The doctor told me yesterday.

758
01:12:55,791 --> 01:13:00,160
So that was the secret.

759
01:13:01,163 --> 01:13:05,463
I might as well tell you
that I intend to have this child.

760
01:13:06,669 --> 01:13:09,297
- You've made up your mind?
- Yes, I have.

761
01:13:25,788 --> 01:13:27,847
You know I don't want a child.

762
01:13:27,957 --> 01:13:30,391
You'll have to choose
between me and the child.

763
01:13:30,492 --> 01:13:33,552
- Poor Evald.
- Don't "poor Evald" me!

764
01:13:34,363 --> 01:13:37,855
It's absurd to bring children
into this world

765
01:13:37,967 --> 01:13:40,834
and think they'll be better off
than we are.

766
01:13:40,936 --> 01:13:44,804
- That's just an excuse.
- Call it what you want.

767
01:13:44,907 --> 01:13:49,207
I was an unwanted child
in a hellish marriage.

768
01:13:49,311 --> 01:13:52,178
Is he even sure I'm his son?

769
01:13:52,281 --> 01:13:55,944
That's no excuse
for behaving like this.

770
01:13:56,051 --> 01:13:57,575
I must be at the hospital at 3:00.

771
01:13:57,686 --> 01:14:00,655
I have neither the time nor the desire
to discuss this any further.

772
01:14:02,725 --> 01:14:04,625
You're a coward.

773
01:14:05,194 --> 01:14:06,661
Yes.

774
01:14:07,029 --> 01:14:09,156
This life sickens me.

775
01:14:09,265 --> 01:14:10,926
I will not be forced to take on

776
01:14:11,033 --> 01:14:13,866
a responsibility that will make me live
for one day longer than I want to.

777
01:14:13,969 --> 01:14:18,838
And you know
that I mean what I say.

778
01:14:31,253 --> 01:14:33,084
I know that this is wrong.

779
01:14:33,188 --> 01:14:35,520
There's neither right nor wrong.

780
01:14:35,624 --> 01:14:39,754
We act according to our needs.

781
01:14:39,862 --> 01:14:41,124
And what are they?

782
01:14:41,864 --> 01:14:46,358
Yours is a hellish desire
to live and to create life.

783
01:14:46,468 --> 01:14:47,594
And yours?

784
01:14:48,737 --> 01:14:52,730
Mine is to be dead.
Stone-dead.

785
01:15:05,621 --> 01:15:09,387
If you want to smoke a cigarette,
I don't mind.

786
01:15:13,729 --> 01:15:16,527
Why have you told me all this?

787
01:15:19,001 --> 01:15:24,940
I saw you with your mother,
and I was panic-stricken.

788
01:15:26,442 --> 01:15:28,103
I don't understand.

789
01:15:30,646 --> 01:15:34,980
I thought: That's his mother.

790
01:15:35,784 --> 01:15:40,847
An old woman, cold as ice,

791
01:15:40,956 --> 01:15:43,982
more forbidding than death.

792
01:15:45,260 --> 01:15:47,490
And this is her son,

793
01:15:48,030 --> 01:15:51,227
and there are light-years
between them.

794
01:15:52,234 --> 01:15:54,896
He himself says
he's a living corpse.

795
01:15:57,005 --> 01:16:02,409
And Evald is growing
just as lonely, cold and dead.

796
01:16:04,113 --> 01:16:07,082
And I thought of the baby inside me.

797
01:16:08,083 --> 01:16:12,349
All along the line,
there's nothing but cold and death

798
01:16:12,454 --> 01:16:15,423
and loneliness.

799
01:16:16,325 --> 01:16:18,657
It must end somewhere.

800
01:16:19,828 --> 01:16:22,353
But you're going back to Evald!

801
01:16:24,133 --> 01:16:27,193
To say I can't agree
to his conditions.

802
01:16:27,302 --> 01:16:31,295
I want this child.
No one can take it from me.

803
01:16:31,407 --> 01:16:33,841
Not even the man
I love most of all.

804
01:16:37,312 --> 01:16:39,337
Can I help you?

805
01:16:39,448 --> 01:16:40,915
No one can help me.

806
01:16:42,518 --> 01:16:45,578
We are too old.
Things have gone too far.

807
01:16:46,522 --> 01:16:49,355
What happened after your talk?

808
01:16:49,458 --> 01:16:51,926
Nothing.
I left him the next day.

809
01:16:52,461 --> 01:16:54,554
Hasn't he gotten in touch with you?

810
01:16:56,498 --> 01:17:01,231
- I don't want us to get...
- To get what?

811
01:17:03,005 --> 01:17:05,599
Like those two in the car today.

812
01:17:07,376 --> 01:17:10,004
I was just thinking of them.

813
01:17:10,546 --> 01:17:14,038
It reminded me of my own marriage.

814
01:17:14,783 --> 01:17:16,614
But we love each other.

815
01:17:16,718 --> 01:17:19,186
Long may he live
Long may he live

816
01:17:19,288 --> 01:17:22,121
May he live to be
a hundred years old

817
01:17:24,426 --> 01:17:27,327
We heard you're celebrating
a grand occasion today.

818
01:17:27,429 --> 01:17:31,627
With these simple flowers
we want to say

819
01:17:31,733 --> 01:17:36,295
that we are very impressed
that you've been a doctor for 50 years.

820
01:17:36,405 --> 01:17:40,205
We know you must be
a very wise old man

821
01:17:41,009 --> 01:17:43,705
who knows everything about life

822
01:17:43,812 --> 01:17:48,249
and has learned
all the instructions by heart.

823
01:17:50,552 --> 01:17:52,986
Thank you.

824
01:17:54,256 --> 01:17:57,419
Now we must go on.
It's getting late.

825
01:18:26,522 --> 01:18:30,982
So you did come.
Evald and I had given up hope.

826
01:18:31,260 --> 01:18:34,024
A nice drive is relaxing, isn't it?

827
01:18:34,863 --> 01:18:37,832
You'll have to get
into your tails at once.

828
01:18:38,867 --> 01:18:42,496
Good afternoon, Marianne.
I've told Evald you're coming.

829
01:18:42,604 --> 01:18:45,072
Thank you.
That was most kind.

830
01:18:46,108 --> 01:18:47,973
So you came after all, Miss Agda.

831
01:18:48,076 --> 01:18:53,173
I considered it my duty.
But my pleasure's been spoiled.

832
01:18:54,483 --> 01:18:56,041
Welcome, Father.

833
01:18:57,319 --> 01:18:59,344
As you see,
I've brought Marianne with me.

834
01:18:59,454 --> 01:19:02,184
- Hello, Marianne.
- May I put my things upstairs?

835
01:19:02,291 --> 01:19:05,283
The guest room as usual, Father?

836
01:19:05,394 --> 01:19:07,760
Let me take your bag.
It's rather heavy.

837
01:19:11,667 --> 01:19:14,534
- Did you have a good trip?
- Yes, it was pleasant.

838
01:19:14,636 --> 01:19:15,864
Who are those young people?

839
01:19:15,971 --> 01:19:18,166
I don't know. They're nice,
and they're off to Italy.

840
01:19:18,273 --> 01:19:21,242
- They seem nice.
- Yes, they're very nice.

841
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:24,039
It's a quarter past 4:00.

842
01:19:29,151 --> 01:19:31,142
I've bought you new shoelaces.

843
01:19:40,095 --> 01:19:42,461
I'm leaving tomorrow,
so don't worry.

844
01:19:42,564 --> 01:19:44,964
- Are you going to a hotel?
- No, why?

845
01:19:45,067 --> 01:19:48,798
Can't we share the bedroom
for one more night? Unless you object.

846
01:19:48,904 --> 01:19:51,873
- Give me a hand unpacking?
- It's nice to see you.

847
01:19:52,040 --> 01:19:53,940
And unexpected.

848
01:19:54,042 --> 01:19:55,737
Same here.

849
01:19:55,844 --> 01:19:58,677
Are we going on
to the banquet afterwards?

850
01:19:58,780 --> 01:20:03,308
Yes, I'll just call Stenberg
and tell him I'll have a lady with me.

851
01:20:10,959 --> 01:20:13,086
Hurry up, Professor!

852
01:21:48,023 --> 01:21:52,960
During the ceremony,

853
01:21:53,061 --> 01:21:56,997
my thoughts strayed
to the day's events,

854
01:21:57,799 --> 01:22:01,997
and it was then I decided

855
01:22:02,104 --> 01:22:04,902
to write down what had happened.

856
01:22:05,373 --> 01:22:11,278
In this jumble of events,

857
01:22:11,379 --> 01:22:15,577
I seemed to discern
an extraordinary logic.

858
01:22:41,243 --> 01:22:44,212
Did you enjoy the ceremony?

859
01:22:44,312 --> 01:22:46,041
Yes, thank you.

860
01:22:47,916 --> 01:22:49,440
Are you tired, Miss Agda?

861
01:22:49,551 --> 01:22:51,143
I won't deny it.

862
01:22:51,253 --> 01:22:53,278
Take one of my sleeping pills.

863
01:22:56,124 --> 01:23:01,027
Miss Agda, I am sorry
about this morning.

864
01:23:01,563 --> 01:23:03,497
Are you ill, Professor?

865
01:23:03,598 --> 01:23:05,532
No. Why?

866
01:23:05,634 --> 01:23:09,070
I don't like the sound of it.

867
01:23:09,704 --> 01:23:12,036
Is it so rare
for me to say I'm sorry?

868
01:23:14,743 --> 01:23:17,075
Do you want the carafe
on the table?

869
01:23:41,236 --> 01:23:45,138
Thank you anyway, Professor.
Good night.

870
01:23:45,740 --> 01:23:47,469
Miss Agda,

871
01:23:49,477 --> 01:23:53,777
as we have known each other

872
01:23:53,882 --> 01:23:56,009
for so many years,

873
01:23:56,117 --> 01:23:59,609
don't you think we could call
each other Agda and Isak?

874
01:23:59,721 --> 01:24:02,383
No, I don't.

875
01:24:02,490 --> 01:24:03,787
Why not?

876
01:24:04,559 --> 01:24:06,390
Have you brushed your teeth,
Professor?

877
01:24:08,263 --> 01:24:12,359
No intimacies for me, thank you.

878
01:24:12,467 --> 01:24:14,628
It's all right between us as it is.

879
01:24:14,736 --> 01:24:17,671
But we are old now.

880
01:24:17,772 --> 01:24:22,539
Speak for yourself.
A woman is jealous of her reputation.

881
01:24:23,245 --> 01:24:27,477
What would people think if we
suddenly began to say Agda and Isak?

882
01:24:27,582 --> 01:24:29,516
They would make fun of us.

883
01:24:29,618 --> 01:24:33,019
Are you always right?

884
01:24:33,121 --> 01:24:35,180
Almost always.

885
01:24:35,290 --> 01:24:40,284
At our age,
we should know how to behave.

886
01:24:47,435 --> 01:24:51,769
Good night, Professor.
I'll leave the door ajar.

887
01:24:51,873 --> 01:24:55,900
You know where I am
if you want anything.

888
01:25:41,556 --> 01:25:45,219
Father Isak! You were splendid
in the procession.

889
01:25:45,327 --> 01:25:47,295
We were terribly proud
to know you.

890
01:25:47,395 --> 01:25:51,354
An old girl is giving us a lift
all the way to Hamburg.

891
01:25:51,466 --> 01:25:54,367
- Anders is mad about her.
- Oh, be quiet.

892
01:25:54,469 --> 01:25:56,266
We just wanted to say good-bye.

893
01:25:56,371 --> 01:25:58,805
Good-bye. And thank you
for your company.

894
01:26:01,142 --> 01:26:03,440
It's you I really love, you know.

895
01:26:03,545 --> 01:26:07,572
Today, tomorrow, always.

896
01:26:08,083 --> 01:26:09,948
I'll remember.

897
01:26:10,385 --> 01:26:13,081
Come on.

898
01:26:18,526 --> 01:26:22,292
We have to go now.

899
01:26:25,900 --> 01:26:28,027
Let me hear from you.

900
01:26:40,148 --> 01:26:42,639
- I think Uncle is asleep.
- Evald!

901
01:26:44,486 --> 01:26:45,748
Yes, Father?

902
01:26:45,854 --> 01:26:47,481
Are you back already?

903
01:26:48,823 --> 01:26:51,291
Marianne lost the heel on a shoe.

904
01:26:53,228 --> 01:26:55,389
So you're going to the dance?

905
01:26:56,564 --> 01:26:58,498
I suppose so.

906
01:26:59,634 --> 01:27:02,694
- How are you, Father?
- Excellent.

907
01:27:02,804 --> 01:27:05,534
- Heart all right?
- Excellent.

908
01:27:07,308 --> 01:27:09,367
Sleep well.

909
01:27:11,579 --> 01:27:14,571
Sit down a moment.

910
01:27:16,284 --> 01:27:18,184
Anything special?

911
01:27:19,487 --> 01:27:24,823
How is it to be
between you and Marianne?

912
01:27:26,294 --> 01:27:27,921
Forgive my asking.

913
01:27:28,029 --> 01:27:29,519
I don't know.

914
01:27:30,365 --> 01:27:33,129
It's not my business, but...

915
01:27:35,136 --> 01:27:37,661
But wouldn't it...

916
01:27:37,772 --> 01:27:39,797
I have asked her to stay with me.

917
01:27:39,908 --> 01:27:42,103
Shouldn't you... I mean...

918
01:27:42,210 --> 01:27:46,476
- I can't live without her.
- You mean alone?

919
01:27:46,581 --> 01:27:49,641
I can't live without her.
That's what I mean.

920
01:27:49,751 --> 01:27:51,719
Oh, I see.

921
01:27:51,820 --> 01:27:53,549
It will be as she wants.

922
01:27:53,988 --> 01:27:56,650
And she...

923
01:27:57,292 --> 01:28:00,455
She says she'll think about it.

924
01:28:01,362 --> 01:28:03,296
About that debt of yours...

925
01:28:03,398 --> 01:28:05,628
Don't worry,
you'll get your money.

926
01:28:05,733 --> 01:28:08,327
That's not what I meant.

927
01:28:10,805 --> 01:28:12,170
How are you, Uncle Isak?

928
01:28:12,273 --> 01:28:14,207
Fine. Just fine.

929
01:28:14,309 --> 01:28:17,301
I lost a heel.
Will these shoes do?

930
01:28:17,412 --> 01:28:19,880
They're very nice.

931
01:28:22,817 --> 01:28:24,910
Thanks for coming with me.

932
01:28:28,256 --> 01:28:31,157
I like you, Marianne.

933
01:28:31,793 --> 01:28:34,091
I like you too, Uncle Isak.

934
01:28:42,570 --> 01:28:46,734
If I have been worried
or sad during the day,

935
01:28:47,242 --> 01:28:52,805
it often calms me
to recall childhood memories.

936
01:28:53,815 --> 01:28:56,181
I did so on this evening too.

937
01:29:08,062 --> 01:29:11,429
Isak, there are no
wild strawberries left.

938
01:29:12,167 --> 01:29:14,397
Auntie wants you
to look for your papa.

939
01:29:14,502 --> 01:29:17,198
We'll sail around and meet you
at the other side of the island.

940
01:29:17,639 --> 01:29:22,008
I can't find either Papa or Mama.

941
01:29:22,610 --> 01:29:25,204
Come, I'll help you.
