1
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,720
<i>A fiction based
on contemporary documents</i>

2
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,491
<i>and the writings of P-L. Basse,
H. Boll and E. Junger</i>

3
00:00:19,691 --> 00:00:23,127
Ladies and gentlemen,
cast your eyes on these athletes!

4
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,648
Ready to break records,
young fellows?

5
00:00:27,848 --> 00:00:29,760
CALM AT SEA

6
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,008
On your marks...

7
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,006
Get set...

8
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,526
See you by the fence later, Odette!

9
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,121
<i>I think of you with the rising sun
And again when the day is done!</i>

10
00:00:53,321 --> 00:00:54,890
That won't help you win!

11
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:56,525
Ifs Lamartine!

12
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,880
What a child!

13
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,524
Yes, indeed,
what a wonderful victory!

14
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,808
And the prize is...

15
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,242
this magnificent bar of soap!

16
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,325
For a better sluice-down
in the shower!

17
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,122
Sport's a wonderful thing.

18
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,481
In the right spirit,
well organized...

19
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,845
And our tobacco?

20
00:02:10,045 --> 00:02:11,087
Of course.

21
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,404
One pack per week per detainee.

22
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,329
Some just arrived.

23
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,120
For tonight, then?

24
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,288
Tomorrow.
With the other provisions.

25
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:34,325
<i>1941 Choisel internment camp</i>

26
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,446
Odette.

27
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,842
OK?

28
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,090
Did you have
your Spanish class today?

29
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,800
Keep out!

30
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,720
There's room for two

31
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,251
She's polygamous, see?

32
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,040
A true revolutionary!

33
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,083
Like Krupskaya, Lenin's wife.

34
00:03:02,283 --> 00:03:03,645
He's already married.

35
00:03:03,845 --> 00:03:05,842
Really? So young?

36
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,000
<i>Behold the burning birth of the moon</i>

37
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,807
<i> Stulcas, 'tis a hear?
spilling o'er the water...</i>

38
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,490
You come to tease

39
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,520
<i>With tiresome wit</i>

40
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,085
<i>The girls by the fence</i>

41
00:03:20,285 --> 00:03:22,567
<i>And you, a married man</i>

42
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,322
<i>Think yourself
the most interesting of all!</i>

43
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,880
<i> lips, pour your divine saliva
Voluptuous blood, steam of the gums</i>

44
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,447
<i>And the trembling fire
of your kiss.</i> ..

45
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,803
Where did you learn such filth?

46
00:03:36,162 --> 00:03:36,960
At school.

47
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,240
It's a sublime poem by Louys,

48
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,640
which <i>isn't</i> taught at school, alas!

49
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,330
But he wouldn't know that.

50
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,244
No, I left early.

51
00:03:45,444 --> 00:03:47,000
He left school

52
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,521
because his father
had been arrested.

53
00:03:49,721 --> 00:03:50,721
Really, Guy?

54
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,964
Someone had to take his place.

55
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,966
That's how you ended up here?

56
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:57,561
No, for handing out leaflets
at the cinema.

57
00:03:57,761 --> 00:04:00,764
And also
for "irregular riding of a bicycle".

58
00:04:00,964 --> 00:04:03,920
Come off it!
You can't be arrested for that!

59
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,930
I swear! The police edict
of 15th March 1925.

60
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,242
And you?

61
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,690
The students' march.
"To the Arc DE Triomphe!"

62
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,041
That was the slogan.

63
00:04:15,241 --> 00:04:17,402
Thousands of us
on the Champs-Elysees.

64
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,411
It was the first time.

65
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,449
- When?
- 11th November.

66
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,210
In memory of the last war.

67
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,646
They arrested you there?

68
00:04:26,846 --> 00:04:28,922
At the Sorbonne,
a few days later.

69
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,841
Get inside, ladies!

70
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,445
He unfurled a French flag
from his satchel.

71
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,285
Get in your huts!

72
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,961
My name's Benjamin.

73
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:48,040
Makes you sound like a kid!
I'm Marcel.

74
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,960
So I call you Benjamin?

75
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,004
Everyone knows me, anyway.
Call me Gilbert.

76
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,400
Brustlein?
Was that you, the Barbes metro job?

77
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,011
You're not to know that.

78
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,403
He'll have our orders.

79
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,761
We have to kill an officer or two.
lt's up to us to decide.

80
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,689
Anytime, anywhere in town.

81
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,050
It has to look like average people
who couldn't take any more.

82
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,280
Understood?

83
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,130
Two 7.65 calibres.

84
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,560
They get jammed.

85
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,764
I prefer 6.355, they're smaller.
I've got two.

86
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,883
You had them on the train?

87
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,889
And you had your papers checked?

88
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,490
Discipline, dammit!

89
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,241
The Party
won't tolerate adventurers!

90
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,402
1918? They're in a dream world!

91
00:06:22,602 --> 00:06:25,763
Especially
as we didn't even get this far.

92
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,648
Get it wiped off.

93
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,120
Captain Sieger
didn't pursue them,

94
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,129
seeing as he wasn't armed.

95
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,000
When he got back to his colleague
he was already dead.

96
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,726
A French doctor certified the death.

97
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,530
Hotz was appointed
Feldkommandant of Nantes in 1940.

98
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,080
He was held in high esteem
by the local people.

99
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:20,330
The motive for the murder could not
have been his professional functions.

100
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,480
His private life, too,
was beyond reproach.

101
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,160
And according to the French police?

102
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,484
The terrorists were very young,

103
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,602
probably members
of the Communist Youth.

104
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,920
Unless they're Gaullists.

105
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,640
If the culprits
aren't arrested very soon,

106
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,401
Berlin will demand
excessive reprisals again.

107
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,731
- Heil Hitler!
- Good morning.

108
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:54,809
His Excellency Ambassador Abetz.

109
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,926
The Fuhrer has heard
about the murdered officer.

110
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,200
Berlin finds out before me

111
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,687
what's happening in your backyard!

112
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,889
It's very awkward for me

113
00:08:12,089 --> 00:08:14,321
to be informed by the Fuhrer.

114
00:08:14,521 --> 00:08:15,851
Your Excellency,

115
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,800
the General is already working
on this case.

116
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,726
The French police have several leads,
but no results yet.

117
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,881
Nantes is surrounded with roadblocks,
there's no way out.

118
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,045
The Fuhrer is expecting
your reprisal propositions

119
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:33,321
before noon.

120
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,126
What time is it now?

121
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,400
It's 10:40.

122
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,409
What's the situation in town?

123
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,960
The locals
are denouncing each other,

124
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,960
there are searches in the street,
a suspect has been apprehended...

125
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,284
Gentlemen, do not take
this matter lightly.

126
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,280
When Private Moser was killed,

127
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,484
the reprisals extended only
to three communists.

128
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,120
Goebbels rightly believes

129
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,448
that a German life has more value.

130
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,401
But in this case
the victim was an officer.

131
00:09:05,601 --> 00:09:07,329
Expect no leniency.

132
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,002
The Fuhrer has ordered the execution
of at least 150 hostages.

133
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,605
That's a terrifying figure.

134
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,043
A hundred and fifty?

135
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,530
How will we win the hearts
of the French people then?

136
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,366
For the moment they still trust us.

137
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,329
The Nazi Party and the SS
don't care about history.

138
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,248
Napoleon would never have allowed
such a thing in Prussia.

139
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,850
According to the Ambassador,
the Fuhrer is fuming.

140
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:41,202
But he doesn't realise
the effect it'll have on the population.

141
00:09:41,402 --> 00:09:43,448
It's just blind vengeance!

142
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,801
I'll offer a reward
of a million gold francs

143
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,284
for any information.
Try to win some time.

144
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,570
We have barely one hour.

145
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,081
I'm an officer, not a butcher!

146
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,528
Abetz must have alerted all Berlin.

147
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,009
I have to draw up the lists.

148
00:10:03,209 --> 00:10:04,520
What lists?

149
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,926
Of hostages.

150
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,081
Hello, I'm Mrs Lalet.

151
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,088
I know he's to be released tomorrow,

152
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,565
but I took the night train,
hoping to see him now.

153
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,280
No problem, Madam.
Your husband's a fine fellow.

154
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,687
I'm glad he can return
to his studies.

155
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,771
I'll have him called.

156
00:10:42,971 --> 00:10:44,166
Stromboni,

157
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,489
call Lalet, Claude.

158
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,326
You're being freed.

159
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,730
You get out tomorrow.

160
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,163
I will need the register.

161
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,561
Which one?

162
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,890
The names of all the detainees.

163
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,283
Well, well, Mr Chassagne!

164
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,200
Former comrade,

165
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,607
former union secretary...

166
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,645
To what do we owe the honor?

167
00:11:33,845 --> 00:11:36,200
Desire! So you're here?

168
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,643
Yes. As you might have been
if you hadn't changed sides.

169
00:11:39,843 --> 00:11:41,280
Watch it, Desire!

170
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,926
I'm inspecting the camp
for the Prefect.

171
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,200
- What can I do for you?
- For me? Nothing.

172
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,243
But for us
political prisoners, a lot!

173
00:11:49,443 --> 00:11:51,204
Like releasing us all!

174
00:11:51,404 --> 00:11:54,480
Victor Renelle!
How are you, old man?

175
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:58,640
It'd be nice to be treated
at least as well as the pimps!

176
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:02,561
- There are common criminals here?
- You don't know much, "Inspector"!

177
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,050
I'll sort you out later, Granet!

178
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,447
And do what I can for you, Victor.

179
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,886
Bastard!

180
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,724
The Wehrmacht
is fighting valiantly in Russia.

181
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,204
You mustn't weaken in France.

182
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,200
We suspect English parachutists

183
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,520
All the more reason
to shoot a few Frenchmen.

184
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,246
They'll beg the English
to stop such attacks.

185
00:12:28,446 --> 00:12:30,249
And the people's reaction?

186
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,448
The French are too individualistic

187
00:12:32,648 --> 00:12:36,361
to understand collective punishment.

188
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,760
It's not in their mentality.

189
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,450
Explain that to the Fuhrer.

190
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:42,480
We're not in Poland!

191
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,844
50 hostages right away,
then twice 50 after that.

192
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,567
It's too soon,
if we hope to obtain confessions.

193
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,047
Yes.

194
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,969
We need to play for time.
The people will be grateful.

195
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:02,649
We are governing France
with a thousand officers.

196
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,969
Collaboration is essential.

197
00:13:05,169 --> 00:13:07,970
That's why we're suggesting
three times 50.

198
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,603
The Fuhrer will decide
at what intervals.

199
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,160
Colonel Speidel.

200
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,523
Once you get the list
of the hostages, send me a copy.

201
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,840
Call Nantes.

202
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,486
I want a report every hour.

203
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,168
In the meantime,
shall we have lunch?

204
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,521
Sir, I'm having lunch
with Sacha Guitry at Prunier's.

205
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,408
It would be awkward to cancel.

206
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:44,410
<i>Cheteaubriant
sub-prefecture! government offices</i>

207
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,409
Hello, ladies and gents!

208
00:13:54,609 --> 00:13:55,806
Herr Kristucat.

209
00:13:56,006 --> 00:13:58,207
Deep shit, Mr Lecornu!

210
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,410
We have a big problem.

211
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,811
You, as Sub-Prefect,
and I, as Commandant

212
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,404
are responsible for Choisel camp.

213
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,847
With its political prisoners
it's a storehouse of hostages.

214
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,768
We have to draw up
- for your Minister in Paris

215
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,802
and for General Stulpnagel -
a list of hostages.

216
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,002
150 names for tomorrow.

217
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,643
Herr Commandant Kristucat,

218
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,726
I'm in charge
of the French administration.

219
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,360
Reprisals
are the German army's business.

220
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,242
I am sorry, but I cannot comply
with such a request.

221
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,287
Gentlemen,

222
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,730
I've just been to Choisel.

223
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,722
There's a subgroup in that camp.

224
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,410
Political prisoners that we looked up
at Germany's request.

225
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,768
They're all in hut number 19.

226
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,960
Lecornu, do you have a list of them?

227
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,884
No, I do not have such a list.

228
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,771
I've never seen one.

229
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,126
You surprise me.

230
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,125
Would you rather shoot
decent Frenchmen

231
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,011
than help us root out
dangerous elements?

232
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,011
- How many in that hut?
- About 20.

233
00:15:24,211 --> 00:15:25,804
We need a lot more.

234
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,968
We seized the camp register
earlier.

235
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,642
Let's do it.

236
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,160
As you just said,

237
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,091
ifs a real storehouse of hostages.

238
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:42,242
They're almost all political,
even the women.

239
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,044
<i>Nein, no women!</i>

240
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,807
Come and sit down, Mr Lecornu.

241
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,603
To do it properly,
let us pick, for the moment,

242
00:15:52,803 --> 00:15:53,840
two hundred.

243
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,485
Paris can select from them.

244
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,444
But the choices
must not seem arbitrary.

245
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,566
There must be a logic.

246
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,410
What logic?

247
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,047
None could have committed
this murder!

248
00:16:07,247 --> 00:16:09,163
There are three criteria.

249
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,210
Political affiliation,

250
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,725
geographical proximity,
I.e. preferably local people...

251
00:16:15,925 --> 00:16:17,040
Commandant,

252
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,440
it is unfair
to punish local people

253
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,961
for an attack committed, I believe,

254
00:16:23,161 --> 00:16:24,924
by communists from Paris.

255
00:16:25,124 --> 00:16:27,771
They may have been agents
from London.

256
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,207
English, perhaps, but not French.

257
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,209
How can you be so sure?

258
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,010
It is not a French tradition

259
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:40,002
to cowardly shoot in the back
soldiers doing their duty.

260
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,201
Let's say communists, then,

261
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,281
half of them from this region.

262
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,451
All the names are here.

263
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,971
Perhaps your secretary
could give us a hand.

264
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,287
Miss Duboc.

265
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,761
Sir?

266
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,641
Write...

267
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,920
No pimps, no pickpockets

268
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,726
- Only political prisoners.
- OK, no pimps...

269
00:17:04,926 --> 00:17:07,400
So we take the communist bosses.

270
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,840
Here's one.

271
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,640
Renelle, Victor.
He's a real loudmouth.

272
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,161
Note that down, Miss.
Renelle, Victor.

273
00:17:15,361 --> 00:17:16,440
How old?

274
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,846
About 50.

275
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:23,040
Captain Seiger saw the killers.
They were very young.

276
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,685
That's the third criterion.

277
00:17:24,885 --> 00:17:27,042
OK, but he's a real hardliner.

278
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,920
There's Granet too
from Gennevilliers

279
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,361
Note that, Miss.
Granet, Desire.

280
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,724
I was told they were friends
of yours, Mr Chassagne.

281
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,920
Friends, no.

282
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,489
Comrades, once.

283
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,841
They're communists who refused
to fight for France in 1939,

284
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,768
at the time
of the German-Soviet pact.

285
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,725
Now they're ignobly trying
to make up for that.

286
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,850
I'll leave it to you.

287
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,841
See if there are any Jews too.

288
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,562
These terrorists are all in the pay
of the Soviets and Jews.

289
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,604
Abachi, Georges.
22, Jewish.

290
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,722
A youth battalion leader
from the 17th arrondissement, Paris.

291
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,245
Bloch, Leon.

292
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,446
Cohen, Jules. David, Emile...

293
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,521
Jungen

294
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,649
I'd like you to keep a record
of these events,

295
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,450
hour by hour.

296
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,805
Everything that happens,

297
00:18:36,005 --> 00:18:37,411
everything that's said.

298
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,767
Not a military report.
Something more literary.

299
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,240
Like Stendhal's report
of Napoleon's campaign?

300
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,006
I know you'd prefer Holderlin,

301
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,529
but what I want
is "historiography

302
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,367
Just one copy.

303
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,401
Yes, Sir.

304
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,445
Keep it simple.

305
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,967
Thank you.

306
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,891
Have you heard from your family?
Are they well?

307
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,530
I feel awkward
enjoying such creature comforts.

308
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,209
My family in Germany
does not live as well as you here.

309
00:19:31,409 --> 00:19:33,129
Materially, you mean.

310
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,849
I know you suffered
the humiliation of defeat,

311
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,800
but I have two sons
on the Russian front.

312
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,843
That's our real enemy.

313
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,321
I've heard nothing more
about the list.

314
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,800
We should avoid stirring things up
while hope remains.

315
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,729
If your police
find the culprits,

316
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,649
we can forget about the list.

317
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,688
Unfortunately, the police
have found no trace of them.

318
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,600
A million gold francs
should have an effect.

319
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,040
How much is that worth?

320
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,086
Fifteen million. A fortune.

321
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,124
Keep your guard up, Guy!

322
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,921
Move your legs!

323
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,604
Look, it's Max Schmeling!

324
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,485
Come on, Guy...

325
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,531
Don't let your guard down.

326
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,763
I bid you good day, Miss.

327
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,690
Is the sea still far?

328
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,486
Do you have wine?

329
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,521
Please.

330
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,686
Thank you very much.

331
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,084
This is cider, is it not'?

332
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,440
Hello, Cadette.

333
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,849
Wish I could get my hands
on teats like those, eh?

334
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,770
You have cigarette?

335
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,801
Hello.

336
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,846
Hello, mate.

337
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,289
Got a cigarette?

338
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,445
Aren't there any here?

339
00:22:10,645 --> 00:22:11,720
You're kidding!

340
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:15,402
We get three per day.
Which last me about an hour.

341
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,487
After that its dog-ends
for 23 hours!

342
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,043
Now that's what I call a smoke!

343
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:26,241
From Rhineland?

344
00:22:26,441 --> 00:22:28,520
You bet!
Are you joining us?

345
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,722
- 3rd Company?
- That's us!

346
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,048
Can you carry my pack?

347
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,481
The bike's a bit wobbly, but...

348
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,168
I can't let a mate down.
Come on, then.

349
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,447
Back to work.

350
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,285
Hand me the flask.

351
00:23:02,203 --> 00:23:03,003
Where is it?

352
00:23:03,203 --> 00:23:04,690
Behind the tent.

353
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,482
So here's the grand gentleman

354
00:23:09,682 --> 00:23:13,651
who isn't strong enough
to carry his own pack!

355
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,449
Sir! I thought the bike
would come in useful.

356
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,330
You "thought"?

357
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,400
Yes, Sir.

358
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,241
Haven't you been taught
to avoid thinking?

359
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,767
No.

360
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:30,520
My superiors encouraged it, in fact.

361
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,210
And where was this?

362
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,840
Saxon Division, 31st Company,
on the Russian front.

363
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,044
There's no thinking here!
No intelligence! Understood?

364
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,963
What's your military training?

365
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,051
Grenadier and telephonist.

366
00:23:47,251 --> 00:23:48,160
Bullshit!

367
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,170
We have too many telephonists,
but never enough grenadiers.

368
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:52,725
Were you wounded?

369
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,768
A bullet in my left shoulder.
But I write with my right hand.

370
00:23:56,968 --> 00:23:57,920
Wonderful!

371
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:01,761
If you can hold a pen
you can pull a trigger.

372
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,727
Starting tomorrow, firing practice
with live ammunition.

373
00:24:05,927 --> 00:24:08,526
And tonight, a bit of guard duty.

374
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,646
Dismissed.

375
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:24,482
The names of the hostages
were taken from various lists.

376
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,480
Communist MPs,

377
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,760
partisans, unionists,

378
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,009
those guilty of violence
towards German soldiers...

379
00:24:32,209 --> 00:24:35,090
Among the communists
there are also some Jews.

380
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:37,123
We have every social class,

381
00:24:37,323 --> 00:24:40,164
but mostly working
and middle class.

382
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,850
It's unavoidable, then?

383
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:47,760
Berlin has made it clear

384
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,360
that the Fuhrer has approved
of staggered executions.

385
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,325
- The general is complying?
- He managed to negotiate.

386
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,491
There won't be
a third group of fifty.

387
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,164
That's to his credit.

388
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:04,040
It doesn't help
his standing in Berlin.

389
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,602
France is just a colony to them.

390
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,320
And Stulpnagel

391
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:12,445
still dreams of a great
European alliance. As do I, in fact.

392
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,561
The French see things differently.

393
00:25:15,761 --> 00:25:17,360
We must convince them.

394
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,961
There's no cure
for the humiliation of defeat.

395
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,840
Our victory
was due to our technology.

396
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,687
Our industry will grow more
after the war,

397
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,289
and France will depend on us.

398
00:25:29,489 --> 00:25:31,130
At the industrial level.

399
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,920
But France remains superior

400
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,168
in matters of taste and culture.

401
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,530
<i>L'art de vivre.</i>

402
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,220
Are these attacks l'art de vivre ?

403
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,727
The terrorists are a tiny minority.

404
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,806
You're a writer, Junger.

405
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,726
Do you still write?

406
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,806
A diary, nothing more.

407
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,520
Faced with the SS,

408
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,769
I feel like the white captain
overpowered by black slaves

409
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,100
<i>on the Benito Cereno</i> .

410
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,726
- What'?
- It's a story by Melville.

411
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,482
You're still a man of letters.

412
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,726
I try to be.

413
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,041
Let me see.

414
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,324
You should get that abscess treated
by the dentist in Chateaubriant.

415
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,970
Will you tell Touya, Doctor?

416
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,326
I could get a pass to go into town.

417
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,321
You didn't seem
in much pain yesterday!

418
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,048
It's time
that wisdom tooth came out.

419
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,486
Your head needs more of that!

420
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,120
You messed around at school too.

421
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,642
I didn't! They made that up
as an excuse for kicking me out.

422
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,685
All because of my dad.

423
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,840
With him in prison,
you should behave.

424
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:54,887
That's what I told my mum.
I'm the head of the household now.

425
00:26:55,087 --> 00:26:58,163
Listen to Timbaud.
He knows what he's talking about.

426
00:26:58,363 --> 00:26:59,850
We have plans for you.

427
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,087
Plans?

428
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,170
Plans as in...

429
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,401
escaping?

430
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,520
Idiot! Keep in shape,
go to classes...

431
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:14,246
At least you won't
have wasted your time here.

432
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,881
Odette!

433
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,047
Give me your hand.

434
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,681
Come closer.

435
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,328
<i>GUY--</i>

436
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,890
Our time will come.

437
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,247
Be patient.

438
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,480
"Our" time?
That calls for a smacker!

439
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,161
A smacker?

440
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,440
A kiss.

441
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,085
You promised, you swore...

442
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,402
See, you don't keep your promises!

443
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,168
Remove your hand.

444
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,371
Close your eyes.

445
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,686
Purse your lips.

446
00:28:08,802 --> 00:28:09,602
That's not fair!

447
00:28:09,802 --> 00:28:12,406
<i>The curfew is now at 7.
Everyone inside!</i>

448
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,883
Come on, lads, it's time!

449
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,280
In your huts!

450
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,000
<i>I repeat: the curfew is now at 7.</i>

451
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,531
Be quick about it!

452
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,326
OK, son?

453
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,648
Yeah.

454
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,885
I saw you with Claude.

455
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,200
By the fence?

456
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,051
No, boxing.
You like boxing, then?

457
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,440
Yeah, a lot.

458
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,367
- A chance to beat people up?
- No.

459
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,126
That's not what boxing's about

460
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,366
Boxing
is all about respect for others.

461
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,808
- Do you want to be a boxer?
- No.

462
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,888
- A doctor.
- A worthy profession.

463
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,087
But when they arrested my dad,
I quit school

464
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,680
so I could help my mum.

465
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,810
I didn't take my exams,

466
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,283
so I can't get into university.

467
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,607
Get inside. Something's up.

468
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,727
The Krauts aren't even trusting
the gendarmes.

469
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,520
Replace me!

470
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,960
I made the Germans remain outside.

471
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:51,130
- It undermines my authority.
- You've had escapees before.

472
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:53,561
- We couldn't shoot!
- I'll authorize it.

473
00:29:53,761 --> 00:29:54,921
In writing!

474
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,520
Paper?

475
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,771
Will you be up to it?

476
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,645
I was in the colonies.

477
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,327
Be prepared for anything tonight.

478
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,085
No one must escape.

479
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,641
Is it for tomorrow?

480
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,004
Unless we catch the culprits.

481
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,365
A 1934 Riesling

482
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,724
All we need now is girls!

483
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,244
<i>It is perfectly right,</i>

484
00:31:01,444 --> 00:31:03,280
<i>perfectly justified,</i>

485
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,240
<i>for Germans
to be killed by Frenchmen.</i>

486
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,640
<i>If the Germans didn't want
to be killed by us,</i>

487
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:13,561
<i>they should have stayed at home
and not waged war on us.</i>

488
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,440
<i>Those who are currently

490
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:26,410
<i>are merely preceding all the others

491
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,884
<i>But there is a tactic
to this war</i>

492
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:35,329
<i>The war of the French people
must be waged</i>

493
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,160
<i>by those whose duty it is.</i>

494
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:42,684
<i>In other words, by myself
and the National Committee.</i>

495
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:46,208
<i>All combatants,</i>

496
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,802
<i>those within the country
and those outside,</i>

497
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,720
<i>must follow orders exactly.</i>

498
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,161
<i>But the orders right now...</i>

499
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:03,800
Granet,

500
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,083
that wireless you're hiding
under your briefcase...

501
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,762
Send it home
or you'll be in solitary.

502
00:32:09,962 --> 00:32:12,930
But you've already searched
and it's allowed.

503
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,080
Have your friends been whining?

504
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,009
That has nothing to do with it!

505
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:20,166
It's no longer allowed.
Send it home.

506
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,007
And Sunday we were getting on
so well!

507
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,845
We have a right to some music.

508
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:31,003
I've learn that you're using it
to receive instructions.

509
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:35,960
There's a code number 66,
which precedes instructions.

510
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,924
Sixty-six!

511
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:41,040
The pimps invent all that stuff

512
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,685
to get in your good books.

513
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,522
You should kick them out

514
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,040
The Krauts'll give them jobs!

515
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,390
As you're insinuating
I listen to informers,

516
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,728
I'm confiscating the wireless!

517
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,042
As representative
of the political prisoners, I protest!

518
00:32:58,242 --> 00:33:00,083
This is an infringement of...

519
00:33:00,283 --> 00:33:02,044
My ares!

520
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,571
- Touchy, isn't she?
- With good reason.

521
00:33:09,771 --> 00:33:11,200
What do you mean?

522
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,641
A terrorist attack in Nantes
this morning.

523
00:33:13,841 --> 00:33:15,410
Hotz was killed.

524
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,246
The Germans are going
to kill 100 hostages.

525
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,564
Including you lot!

526
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,565
Not a word to the others, you hear?
Not a word!

527
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,087
Clear off!

528
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,525
If it was our lads,
it was a bad idea.

529
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,125
30 comrades shot
is a high price to pay.

530
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:57,210
Probably some chaps sent from Paris.
To relieve the pressure there.

531
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,881
Who'd have expected such a reaction?
For Moser they killed 3.

532
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,728
How did they get from 3 to 30?

533
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:07,571
That's easy, teacher.
You add a zero!

534
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,370
Don't try to understand.

535
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,411
The three for Moser
were guillotined.

536
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,330
What will they do with us?

537
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:30,570
Hanged, guillotined, shot,
quartered...

538
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:34,400
What does bumping off
a German officer get us?

539
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,968
Could be another order from Moscow.

540
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,924
I was against the Party's pact
with Hitler.

541
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:45,085
Allying with fascists we'd fought
in Spain... But it's different now!

542
00:34:45,285 --> 00:34:47,720
Those who give
the orders are cowards,

543
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,843
letting innocent people
pay the price.

544
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,210
If the Revolution
requires such methods as these,

545
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:57,570
those who carry out these acts
should sacrifice themselves

546
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,962
rather than their comrades.

547
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,444
If 30 of us are killed,

548
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,526
it'll reveal
what the Germans are really like.

549
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,090
The people will realise
Hitler is at war with them

550
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:18,645
and they will rise.

551
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,080
No more collaboration!

552
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,160
Yes, we won't die for nothing.

553
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,850
It'll be a turning point.

554
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,249
Leave martyrdom for Catholics!

555
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,205
I fought in order to live.
Why don't we run?

556
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,560
Yes, a mass break-out!

557
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,440
I have a place not far away.

558
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,368
You're dreaming!

559
00:35:35,568 --> 00:35:37,244
Fernand and Henaff got away.

560
00:35:37,444 --> 00:35:39,329
Without all those angry Krauts.

561
00:35:39,529 --> 00:35:43,366
We'll take them by surprise.
We've got nothing to lose.

562
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,404
With my wooden leg?

563
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,960
I'd prefer barbed wire
to a firing squad.

564
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:52,403
- They'd just take other hostages.
- Where from, if we all go?

565
00:35:52,603 --> 00:35:55,126
- The next hut.
- They're not political.

566
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:58,166
They don't care.
Just more bloodshed.

567
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,605
So what do we do?

568
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,408
If I had my flying machine

569
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,362
we'd soon be out of here.

570
00:36:18,562 --> 00:36:20,210
Like angels!

571
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,244
You may laugh but ifs true.

572
00:36:22,444 --> 00:36:24,681
I cobbled together an aeroplane.

573
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,006
We're not sure of anything
for the moment.

574
00:36:28,206 --> 00:36:30,441
It's true, they're just rumors.

575
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,971
Michele is right.

576
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,764
Not a word to the others.

577
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,731
It only concerns us.

578
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,922
<i>It's awful,
not telling what I</i> know.

579
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:50,647
<i>That lucky devil Claude
will be released tomorrow.</i>

580
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,767
Here.

581
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,247
Thanks.

582
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,241
<i>I don't know
why I shouldn't get out too.</i>

583
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,481
<i>Odette made me a promise today.</i>

584
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,604
<i>"Our time will come, " she said.</i>

585
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:17,967
Rino.

586
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,122
Try this one.

587
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,049
- Where'd you get it'?
- From my mum.

588
00:37:25,249 --> 00:37:26,844
You're lucky.

589
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:28,371
I know.

590
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,888
She sent it to me

591
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,885
in a parcel.

592
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,686
It cost her 41 francs.

593
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,530
It's really nice.

594
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,766
Curfew!

595
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,369
If I see a light, I'll shoot it!

596
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,562
<i>Malleus Maleficarum.</i>

597
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,084
I found it at Beres.

598
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:09,243
The Venetian edition from 1574.

599
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,680
You're mad, Ernst!
You shouldn't have!

600
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,360
At another time
I'd have kept it.

601
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,160
Back when

602
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,365
I was studying drugs,

603
00:39:20,565 --> 00:39:24,326
and I was looking
into sorcery and demonism...

604
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,889
I hope you like it.

605
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,601
You spoil me!

606
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,008
That's my strategy!

607
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,807
Do you still frequent
the Madeleine area?

608
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,446
For as long
as a certain Parisian fortress

609
00:39:44,646 --> 00:39:46,324
continues to resist me!

610
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,566
You shouldn't.

611
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,685
It's dangerous.

612
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,970
- And not just medically.
- I feel healthy enough.

613
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:00,723
And those creatures amuse me.

614
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,246
Today,

615
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:06,690
this one had a tiny hat
no bigger than a bird's nest,

616
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:10,728
with a long green feather
with which she tickled my...

617
00:40:10,928 --> 00:40:12,251
You're disgusting!

618
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,289
The things they say...

619
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,211
No, stop!

620
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,762
I don't want to hear your filth!

621
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:25,604
I've been surprising myself,
on my walks,

622
00:40:25,804 --> 00:40:30,044
by picking out places
where I could one day settle down.

623
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,604
- In Paris?
- Yes.

624
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,367
This war will not last forever.

625
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:40,448
Our General sees us
united in one great Europe.

626
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,129
A Germanic one, of course.

627
00:40:43,329 --> 00:40:44,810
Not necessarily.

628
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,641
Do you really believe

629
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,009
this regime will end?

630
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,162
In violence, yes.

631
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,247
In the historical tradition

632
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,008
of the assassinated tyrant?

633
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,163
Some people think so.

634
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,764
- In Germany?
- Even here.

635
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,087
You?

636
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,125
They make appeals to me.

637
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,526
But I prefer the role of witness.

638
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:19,490
An observer?
Even, to some extent, a voyeur?

639
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:22,206
No. I am not afraid of action.

640
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:25,411
But I am a soldier, not a murderer.

641
00:41:25,611 --> 00:41:26,806
In any case,

642
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:30,442
I feel no calling
to change the course of history.

643
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,630
Yet that is what you are doing,

644
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,800
by being here as the occupier.

645
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,045
All I am doing

646
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:43,166
is honoring the uniform,
which is every officer's duty.

647
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,643
And never forgetting
the wretched all around us.

648
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,925
In the Rue Vieille du Temple,

649
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,449
I saw Jews being arrested,
families separated.

650
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,651
The sobbing of the children
was unbearable.

651
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,609
Did your uniform help you
save any of them?

652
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,085
Where's the front line?

653
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,886
At a point
between high and low tide.

654
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,764
It's somewhere over there
that they'll land.

655
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,605
One day or another.

656
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,761
Hey...

657
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,721
Any of those good cigarettes left?

658
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,086
Password?

659
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,080
"Poacher"!

660
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,160
Arsenal!

661
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,490
Hare stew tomorrow!

662
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,771
I could do
without the live firing practice.

663
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,801
Could you shoot a man?

664
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,926
It's him or me.

665
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,366
I don't know...

666
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,931
Shut up
or you'll end up in Dachau.

667
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,683
If there's trouble brewing,

668
00:43:50,883 --> 00:43:54,407
just act crazy.
Play it up and shout,

669
00:43:54,607 --> 00:43:56,090
"I can't kill!"

670
00:43:56,290 --> 00:43:57,520
Be quiet!

671
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,162
Coffee's ready!

672
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:22,247
Guy! Wake up, pussycat!

673
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,330
Here are the lists
returned by the Interior Ministry.

674
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,929
They've barely made any changes.

675
00:44:45,129 --> 00:44:47,885
Well done.
It shows you did diligent work.

676
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,644
On the contrary, Commandant,
there are some serious mistakes.

677
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,563
One of the men
is about to be released.

678
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,689
The student Lalet, Claude.

679
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:03,321
Another, Renelle,
a chemical engineer,

680
00:45:03,521 --> 00:45:06,251
should have been released
a good while ago.

681
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:08,364
And a third is only 17.

682
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,367
Moquet. He's just a kid.

683
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:15,890
I remember.
He was on Chassagne's list.

684
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:17,286
But why?

685
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:21,200
He wasn't one
of the definite 27 hostages.

686
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:22,811
You can't shoot those three.

687
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,249
I can't change it, Lecornu

688
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,080
The list was approved by Paris

689
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:38,009
Some legal sense must be applied.

690
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:41,331
I'll supply you
with the necessary documents.

691
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:46,450
Or the German army will be seen
to be shooting innocent men!

692
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,202
And children!

693
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:58,681
I can make a phone call

694
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:02,690
to try to demand a pardon
for those three.

695
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:03,768
Thank you.

696
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:08,645
But on one condition. You choose
three others to replace them.

697
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,569
To make the task easier,

698
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,285
here's the register.

699
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:23,529
Just pick the first three names
not already on the list.

700
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,928
<i>Notice. Cowards have murdered</i>

701
00:46:54,128 --> 00:46:58,720
<i>the Feldkommandant of Nantes
by shooting him in the back.</i>

702
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:02,049
<i>So far, the killers
have not been caught.</i>

703
00:47:02,249 --> 00:47:07,041
<i>I have therefore ordered
the shooting of 50 hostages.</i>

704
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:10,560
<i>Another 50 will be shot</i>

705
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:13,570
<i>if the culprits still evade capture.</i>

706
00:47:13,770 --> 00:47:18,004
<i>Signed, General Von Stulpnagel.</i>

707
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,729
We're not very popular!

708
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,930
Shit!

709
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:50,566
The bastards!

710
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:53,088
The Party didn't expect this.

711
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,561
This'll stir up the shit.
I hope they don't just dump us.

712
00:47:57,761 --> 00:48:00,000
Come off it, we're their heroes!

713
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:03,488
It wouldn't be the first time
"for tactical reasons"...

714
00:48:03,688 --> 00:48:05,125
Shut up, Marcel!

715
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,931
Anyway, we have to split up.

716
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,210
I have no idea where to go.

717
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:17,646
Stay away from stations, hotels...

718
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:19,441
I know someone in Rennes.

719
00:48:19,641 --> 00:48:22,484
I didn't hear that.
Neither did you, Marcel.

720
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:25,722
- And the guns?
- We keep them.

721
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:28,730
War is so bloody stupid!

722
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,607
When we've changed society,
there'll be no wars.

723
00:48:33,807 --> 00:48:36,007
In the meantime,
our comrades are in for it!

724
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,400
What do you mean?

725
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,728
I recognised three or four names.

726
00:48:39,928 --> 00:48:41,763
They'll understand.

727
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:45,570
What if we give ourselves up?

728
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:49,571
Me, at least. I fired.

729
00:48:49,771 --> 00:48:51,524
Show some pride!

730
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:55,803
Better one than fifty!

731
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:03,251
The Krauts think
there's more than one of us.

732
00:49:03,451 --> 00:49:05,960
More than three.
That we're an army.

733
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:09,164
We will be, once we've woken up
the sleeping patriots.

734
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:11,080
Keep on talking!

735
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:12,850
As for me...

736
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,047
Gilbert!

737
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,044
Don't fight among yourselves!

738
00:49:29,244 --> 00:49:31,208
Leave me, I've made my mind up!

739
00:49:31,603 --> 00:49:32,400
Let me go!

740
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,170
We can't fight among ourselves!

741
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:52,885
Here's the list.

742
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,810
Attention!

743
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:07,047
All prisoners in their huts!

744
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:09,291
Immediately!

745
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,565
Lunch is canceled.

746
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,206
You again, Timbaud?

747
00:50:35,406 --> 00:50:36,890
What's going on?

748
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:38,811
Back in your huts.

749
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:40,446
No grub?

750
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:42,605
Back in your huts, I said.

751
00:50:42,805 --> 00:50:45,326
Is this your doing
or an order from the Krauts?

752
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,286
Hey, out it out!

753
00:50:47,486 --> 00:50:48,766
In your huts!

754
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,884
Can't leave it for Touya!

755
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:12,364
I've washed my laundry.
One less job for my wife

756
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:14,649
Even if it's still wet.

757
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:17,042
The whole town's talking about it.

758
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,365
They won't be long now.

759
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:21,326
Time to turn the page.

760
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,041
A page of history.

761
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:27,209
It's time we smoked these.

762
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:35,845
We're coping OK
for firing-squad beginners!

763
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:45,846
That's it!

764
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,320
It's us.

765
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:50,420
They're coming for us.

766
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:53,451
Ready, section!

767
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:54,727
Be vigilant.

768
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,526
Get in position.

769
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:04,681
Gentlemen,

770
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:08,726
come out when your name is called.

771
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:11,328
Pesquet, Antoine.

772
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:14,522
Lefevre, Edmond.

773
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,289
Gardette, Maurice.

774
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,482
Granet, Desire.

775
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,322
Timbaud, Jean-Pierre.

776
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:30,006
Pourchasse, Henri.

777
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,966
Bourhis, Marc.

778
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:39,287
Guegin, Pierre.

779
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,768
Grandel, Jean.

780
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,521
Poulmarc'h, Jean.

781
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,085
Desire Granet.

782
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,087
Timbaud.

783
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:09,830
They're shooting them here?

784
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:12,766
All those called, go to hut 6.

785
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:26,011
I wasn't called.

786
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:28,200
Nor me.

787
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:29,970
We're not going, then.

788
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:31,806
It's a lottery.

789
00:53:32,006 --> 00:53:33,520
Line up in threes!

790
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:35,210
What do they want with us?

791
00:53:35,410 --> 00:53:36,890
Hurry up, get outside!

792
00:53:37,090 --> 00:53:38,605
Quick about it!

793
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:40,571
Line up in threes!

794
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,642
All those I call, step forward.

795
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:54,650
Kerivel, Eugene.

796
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:00,444
David, Emile.

797
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:05,724
Bastard, Maximilien.

798
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:11,083
DE La Vaquerie, Charles.

799
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:16,529
Good God, you're not going
to shoot these kids!

800
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:17,890
Gaudin, get back!

801
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:21,121
Take me,

802
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,571
but not these kids!

803
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,050
Le Panse, Julien.

804
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:33,929
Those I called, go to hut 6.

805
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:44,800
That makes 21.

806
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:28,727
Gentlemen.

807
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,206
If you please...

808
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:36,609
Tellier, Raymond. Out.

809
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,286
Khuong, Huynk.

810
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:47,806
Bartoli, Titus.

811
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:56,250
I'm sorry.
You should have stayed in Tonkin.

812
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:01,524
Lalet, Claude.

813
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:04,361
It's a mistake.

814
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:09,443
My liberation
took effect this morning.

815
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:11,202
Come on.

816
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:13,650
You have the slip.

817
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:16,761
My wife's waiting for me!

818
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,162
Your name is on the list.

819
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:24,607
Come on!

820
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,171
Give this to my wife.

821
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:36,891
Kiss her for me.

822
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:42,125
Two more, Commandant.

823
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:43,681
The last...

824
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:48,484
DrTenine, Maurice.
And Moquet, Guy.

825
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:50,340
No, he's the youngest!

826
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:58,367
Present.

827
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:12,642
Farewell.

828
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:15,681
Farewell, pals.

829
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,090
Long live freedom, Comrades!

830
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:26,940
Where are they taking you?

831
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:32,287
Come on, get a move on!

832
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:36,006
That's the lot.

833
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:46,491
I'm getting out of here!

834
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:51,890
DE La Vaquerie!

835
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:54,480
Stop it! Come on, calm down!

836
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:55,647
Take it easy...

837
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:58,885
How will they do it?

838
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:01,888
Not here, surely!

839
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,323
Haven't you seen the machine-gun?

840
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:08,521
They could hang us from the beams.

841
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:16,366
The Sub-Prefect!

842
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:19,647
Gentlemen,

843
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:23,246
you must know
what my presence means.

844
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:26,801
You have been designated
by the Germans.

845
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:30,407
I am sorry, but I could not stop it.

846
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:34,123
You will be shot within the hour.

847
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:37,450
Where? Here?

848
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,923
You'll be taken to the sand quarry.

849
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:45,121
On behalf of France, I regret this
with the utmost sincerity.

850
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:47,724
Even the 17-year-old?

851
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:49,846
Alas, yes.

852
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:55,884
In Nantes, at the same moment,

853
00:58:56,240 --> 00:59:00,484
an equal number of Gaullist and
Nationalist hostages will be shot.

854
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,286
Courage, gentlemen!

855
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:07,247
Vive la France!

856
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:09,563
Yeah, and the Republic!

857
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:18,288
You may write to your families.

858
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:25,367
Gentlemen.

859
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,530
You like writing...

860
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:03,248
It's now or never, don't you think?

861
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:06,321
You're right.

862
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:29,640
<i>My Darling Mother,
My Dear Brother, My Beloved Father,</i>

863
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:31,126
<i>I am going to die.</i>

864
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:49,722
Thank you.

865
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:51,845
Thank you for coming.

866
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:56,811
I don't know what sort of welcome
you'll get. They're all communists.

867
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:58,811
How do you know?

868
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,207
Because of the lists we drew up.

869
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,446
How did you get mixed up in this?

870
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:12,687
I have acted as an official
with a sense of responsibility.

871
01:01:12,887 --> 01:01:16,202
Responsibility? You should leave
that to the Germans!

872
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:20,640
I couldn't let decent Frenchmen die.

873
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:23,280
And you're still part of it!

874
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:25,847
Why?
How can you not realise that?

875
01:01:26,047 --> 01:01:27,929
No politics, please.

876
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:30,363
Yes, let's talk politics!

877
01:01:30,563 --> 01:01:33,211
This hostage policy is madness.

878
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:35,960
And endless.

879
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:39,926
A firing squad leads to a killing,
a killing to a firing squad...

880
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:44,445
It's a vicious circle.

881
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:47,521
- Are you a Christian?
- Of course.

882
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:49,808
You don't act like one.

883
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,048
Don't be a slave to your orders.

884
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:58,483
Listen to your conscience.

885
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:16,520
My friends,

886
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:21,008
I have not come here
to attack your convictions

887
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,843
or beliefs.

888
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:45,202
Yes, I'm a priest.

889
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:51,364
If some of you wish
to benefit from my ministrations,

890
01:02:51,564 --> 01:02:53,927
I am at your disposal.

891
01:02:57,120 --> 01:03:00,408
But I wish mainly to point out
that I am here

892
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:03,088
to share your final moments,

893
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:09,923
to help you
as you make this ultimate sacrifice,

894
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:13,649
and to urge you to die

895
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:16,043
as a Frenchman should.

896
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:20,680
I come also as a friend,

897
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:23,724
to receive any last requests
or messages,

898
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:26,120
and your letters.

899
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:32,726
Mr Curate

900
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:36,760
Do you know why we in particular,
here in Choisel, were picked?

901
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:38,849
Or what exactly happened in Nantes?

902
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:43,289
No, I don't know anything
about those matters.

903
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:45,487
Thank you.

904
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:58,810
<i>By the time you receive this letter
I shall be gone,</i>

905
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:02,090
<i>executed by the Germans
for a crime I did not commit.</i>

906
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:03,520
<i>I shall die bravely...</i>

907
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:04,448
My Dear Henrietta...

908
01:04:04,648 --> 01:04:06,404
...with no regrets...

909
01:04:06,604 --> 01:04:08,280
<i>Promise to be brave</i>

910
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:13,486
<i>For two months I've been thinking of
these last moments, far from you...</i>

911
01:04:13,686 --> 01:04:16,331
<i>Darling, I have always loved you...</i>

912
01:04:16,531 --> 01:04:18,160
<i>I am</i> a <i>hostage</i>

913
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:20,408
<i>I die a victim of my ideals...</i>

914
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:25,966
<i>My last thoughts will be of you.
I shall not tremble.</i>

915
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:28,765
<i>My Dear Yvonne,</i>

916
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:31,322
<i>Be as brave as I am.</i>

917
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:34,691
Show courage and confidence.

918
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:37,970
<i>There are 27 of</i> us...

919
01:04:38,170 --> 01:04:39,321
<i>Words</i>

920
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:43,686
<i>cannot express
the intensity of this moment...</i>

921
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:54,607
<i>I remember how we used to stroll,
picking mushrooms...</i>

922
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:57,081
<i>My last thoughts will be of you...</i>

923
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:00,762
Hey, student... Can you help me?

924
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:11,524
"This letter is my last.

925
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:14,806

Lalet, Claude!

930
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:46,891
Father, can you help me?

931
01:05:48,840 --> 01:05:51,810
Permission to see your wife.
Ten minutes.

932
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:00,206
Ten minutes!

933
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:02,566
Not so fast!

934
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:34,966
<i>All my life I've fought
for a better mankind.</i>

935
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,401
<i>I believe
you will see this dream realised.</i>

936

<i>My Dear Raymond,</i>

<i>You'll never again see

939

<i>Such grief for a child...</i>

Gentlemen...

964
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:22,531
Today at 2 p.m. there was a call
from the Vichy government.

965
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:26,726
Marshal Petain
expressed his unease thus...

966
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,401
"All this blood will fall on us.

967
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:31,840
"There is
only one honorable solution,

968
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:34,771
"for me to give myself
to the Germans as a hostage.

969
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:40,290
"To this end, I shall present myself
at the demarcation line

970
01:08:40,490 --> 01:08:43,051
"near Moulins, in the Allier."

971
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:45,486
What do you think?

972
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:47,730
Old school.

973
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:52,690
The hero of 1918.

974
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,080

982
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:28,888
We don't share
your religious convictions,

983
01:09:29,088 --> 01:09:31,686
but your church
had its martyrs too.

984
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:34,324
We too believe in our cause.

985
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:38,368
We die for France
and the international proletariat.

986
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:42,686
Lalet, it's time.
Let's go.

987
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:06,801
Guegin.

988
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:08,806
Raymond Laforge.

989
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:12,481
Grandel.

990
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:15,126
DE La Vaquerie.

991
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:20,806
Gentlemen, ifs time.

992
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:29,730
Line up in twos.

993
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:33,051
We must decide
how we're going to die.

994
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:35,522
We refuse blindfolds.

995
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:39,084
- We'll shout Vive la France I
- Or "Death to Hitler!"

996
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,048
With courage we can face anything.

997
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:49,129
Out You go!

998
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:53,126
Move it along!

999
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:56,086
Hurry up, get in the truck!
You too!

1000
01:10:58,240 --> 01:10:59,480
Be brave, Comrades!

1001
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,721
I'm only a worker, but my overalls
are cleaner than your uniform.

1002
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:19,887
Odette!

1003
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:21,247
Guy!

1004
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:47,210
Give this to the girls.
They'll know who it's for.

1005
01:11:56,560 --> 01:12:00,690
<i>This is the final struggle</i>

1006
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:04,726
<i>Let us group together,
and tomorrow...</i>

1007
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:09,244
Mr Curate, pray for us.

1008
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:24,847
Claude!

1009
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:42,685
Stop or I'll shoot!

1010
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:54,641
Eugenie!

1011
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:18,328
It's the Minister, for you.

1012
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:24,205
Yes, Sir.

1013
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:28,291
Yes, they've just left.
All 27.

1014
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:34,042
Very well, we'll see to it.

1015
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,843
They're two short in Nantes.

1016
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:43,686
So?

1017
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:46,924
We have to find two more.

1018
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:49,841
Out of the question!

1019
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:53,130
Just those on the list!

1020
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:56,526
Sir,

1021
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:59,451
Marshal Petain
has just withdrawn his offer.

1022
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:04,041
Instead, he's going to make
a solemn appeal to the French people.

1023
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:06,210
He'll condemn these attacks

1024
01:14:06,410 --> 01:14:09,051
and call on the people
to collaborate.

1025
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:12,526
His speech
has been approved by Berlin.

1026
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:21,251
I fear it doesn't have
quite the same effect

1027
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:24,481
as "Marshal Petain: hostage".

1028
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:29,604
Two men per post.

1029
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:32,971
For tying the hostage.
Get moving!

1030
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:36,962
Attach blindfold,
untie, clear the body away.

1031
01:14:37,162 --> 01:14:39,208
Cover the blood with sand.

1032
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:44,568
Three riflemen to each post.

1033
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:48,490
Stand twelve paces away.

1034
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:51,720
In each group of three,

1035
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:54,082
one man will be firing a blank.

1036
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:56,362
Ready for rehearsal!

1037
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:01,887
Put the rope under the arms.

1038
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:05,843
Now is the time
to practice tying the knot.

1039
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:09,403
Your movements
must be calm and precise.

1040
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:12,371
Reassuring, so to speak.
Unflustered.

1041
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:17,168
You must be able
to untie the knot easily.

1042
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:18,801
And quickly.

1043
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:24,241
Like that.

1044
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:26,769
Keep up a rhythm.

1045
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:30,648
The faster it is done,
the cleaner the execution.

1046
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:32,962
As we have 27 candidates,

1047
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:36,411
we have to do the whole thing
three times.

1048
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:37,568
Silence!

1049
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:39,087
Silence!

1050
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:43,242
These men are criminals,
Jewish scum and Bolsheviks,

1051
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:46,723
who cowardly murdered
one of your comrades!

1052
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:57,126
For those of you
with no knowledge of anatomy...

1053
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:00,324
The heart is here.

1054
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:05,651
The military nurse
will place a white cross here

1055
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:08,451
once the hostages
have been blindfolded.

1056
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:13,404
Stop chattering!
It's in the rulebook, 351213

1057
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:14,762
Any questions?

1058
01:16:14,962 --> 01:16:15,882
No.

1059
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:20,725
- Sir.
- Yes?

1060
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:24,883
I don't know if I'm capable.

1061
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:29,520
What?

1062
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:34,571
You're a potential officer of war!
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

1063
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:38,123
Others might do it better than I.

1064
01:16:38,323 --> 01:16:42,769
Yes, loads of them could!
Soldiers, not little girlies!

1065
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:46,288
But ifs you that needs it!
In line, Mr Paper-Pusher!

1066
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:59,681
In Nantes the first hostages
have already been shot.

1067
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:03,765
Impressive.

1068
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:06,760
No incident, no violence.

1069
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:09,850
With discipline
and in absolute calm.

1070
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:14,801
Everyone is commending the courage
and dignity of the condemned men.

1071
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:20,163
Man only seems to find his true
grandeur when faced with death.

1072
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:25,201
When one extols the human will
and hope in this way,

1073
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:29,641
other signs become evident.

1074
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:33,326
I'm going to request
my removal from office.

1075
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:37,480
Whatever decision I take

1076
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:41,162
will be the wrong one.
Whether I act or not.

1077
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:47,605
Sir, I would not dare
to criticise your decision,

1078
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:51,360
but you are held in great esteem

1079
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:54,166
by the Wehrmacht
and even by the local people.

1080
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:58,404
Your ancestors fought in Russia
at Napoleon's side.

1081
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:03,211
You have more credibility
than anyone else.

1082
01:18:03,411 --> 01:18:06,847
If you could bring an end
to this policy of retaliation,

1083
01:18:07,047 --> 01:18:09,281
France would be grateful to you.

1084
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:47,246
Ropes ready!

1085
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:51,849
And ammunition!

1086
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:56,528
- Release the cuffs.
- Gentlemen.

1087
01:18:57,640 --> 01:18:59,369
Above all, stay calm.

1088
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:02,210
Calm and precise.

1089
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:04,250
Maintain the distances.

1090
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:06,321
Very good.

1091
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:08,882
Good.

1092
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:17,006
Rhythm!

1093
01:19:25,680 --> 01:19:26,647
Very good.

1094
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:28,684
Distribute the ammunition.

1095
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:30,803
One bullet per man.

1096
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:47,923
<i>Remember 22nd October,
two in the afternoon.</i>

1097
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:51,320
<i>My last thought will be of you.</i>

1098
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:54,451
<i>It will help me
get through this last ordeal.</i>

1099
01:19:56,520 --> 01:19:58,841
<i>I kiss you one last time.</i>

1100
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:01,166
<i>Your husband,</i>

1101
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:04,564
<i>in thanks for the loving life
you gave him.</i>

1102
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:07,404
<i>Am I dreaming?</i>

1103
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:11,010
<i>Farewell. Farewell forever
I love you.</i>

1104
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:12,762
No.

1105
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:15,686
<i>Let us sing.</i>

1106
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:18,164
<i>Let us sing with all our strength.</i>

1107
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:22,124
<i>Poor darling Toto.</i>

1108
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:25,087
<i>Other Totos will sing too.</i>

1109
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:26,850
<i>At least I have lived.</i>

1110
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:32,769
Now you can tell Camilla
that I loved her madly.

1111
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:36,009
Poor madman that I was!

1112
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:41,010
Division...

1113
01:20:41,210 --> 01:20:42,167
Load!

1114
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:54,246
Aim!

1115
01:20:58,720 --> 01:20:59,607
Fire!

1116
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:06,046
Order arms!

1117
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:35,122
Gentlemen!

1118
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:00,441
Stand up straight!

1119
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:04,764
Not a bad act.

1120
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:08,080
But I've seen better.

1121
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:10,009
You need to work at it.

1122
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:30,251
He's not faking.

1123
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:39,603
Next!

1124
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:45,486
Calmly!

1125
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:02,131
Take off the cuffs.

1126
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:10,284
Forward. Walk.

1127
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:19,329
Maintain the distances!

1128
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:27,084
Come on! Rhythm!

1129
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:46,610
- Freedom!
- The Party!

1130
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:48,803
The international proletariat!

1131
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:06,324
<i>My Dear Odette,</i>

1132
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:09,888
<i>I am going to die
with my 26 comrades.</i>

1133
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:12,484
<i>We are being brave.</i>

1134
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:17,484
<i>What I regret is not having had
what you promised me.</i>

1135
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:22,242
<i>A thousand big cuddles
from your loving comrade,</i>

1136
01:24:22,442 --> 01:24:23,487
<i>GUY-</i>

1137
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:27,045
<i>Big kisses to Marie
and the others.</i>

1138
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:38,410
Come down!

1139
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:40,086
Move it!

1140
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:44,690
Show some nerve!

1141
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:52,320
<i>Stand up, damned of the Earth</i>

1142
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:55,922
<i>Stand up, prisoners of starvation</i>

1143
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:59,920
