1
00:00:37,248 --> 00:00:41,085
LIKE IN A MIRROR

2
00:01:36,557 --> 00:01:40,019
FOR Käbi, my wife

3
00:02:21,227 --> 00:02:26,357
- First at the dock! - That felt good.

4
00:02:27,066 --> 00:02:30,319
Dad and Martin put up the nets and Minus and I get the milk.

5
00:02:30,486 --> 00:02:34,698
No, David and Minus are doing the nets and I'm going for a walk with my wife.

6
00:02:34,865 --> 00:02:38,536
Or Karin and I put up the nets and Minus and Martin get the milk.

7
00:02:38,702 --> 00:02:43,249
I don't want to do either. I decide for myself what I do.

8
00:02:43,374 --> 00:02:48,504
-Should we get the milk, Minus? -Why do women always make the decisions?

9
00:02:48,671 --> 00:02:54,301
Let's do what Karin wants! That way we won't lose our dignity.

10
00:02:54,426 --> 00:02:59,306
We would have saved a lot of time if Dad had said that right away!

11
00:03:00,808 --> 00:03:03,978
Should we get dressed before we put up the nets?

12
00:03:04,103 --> 00:03:05,479
What do you think?

13
00:03:05,729 --> 00:03:09,316
It's quite chilly, and my bathrobe is thin.

14
00:03:09,441 --> 00:03:12,486
-If you're cold... - Me? Not at all. You?

15
00:03:12,653 --> 00:03:17,283
You said it was cool. But it really is a bit windy...

16
00:03:17,449 --> 00:03:21,662
We're toughening ourselves up. Virility is more important than health, right?

17
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:25,583
We've been able to do what Hemingway can do for a long time! Forward march!

18
00:03:49,565 --> 00:03:53,027
- I wonder if there's a thunderstorm? - Not today.

19
00:03:53,194 --> 00:03:56,280
I don't know, look at the clouds.

20
00:03:56,447 --> 00:04:00,784
- Are you afraid of thunderstorms? - And what kind.

21
00:04:00,951 --> 00:04:05,206
- The thunderstorms in Switzerland... - Did you like it there otherwise?

22
00:04:05,372 --> 00:04:10,544
I was homesick. But I wanted to finish the novel first.

23
00:04:10,711 --> 00:04:14,548
-And is it finished now? -Yes, pretty much.

24
00:04:14,715 --> 00:04:20,262
-How's your stomach ulcer? - It's okay. Can you give me something?

25
00:04:20,429 --> 00:04:24,642
We can go to the pharmacy tomorrow. I have a few things to do anyway.

26
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:30,564
Did you get my last letter? I sent it on Monday.

27
00:04:30,731 --> 00:04:35,236
- I was in Basel with the Waldsteins. - Then you didn't get him.

28
00:04:35,361 --> 00:04:39,573
- And I flew here on Wednesday. - Then you didn't get it.

29
00:04:39,698 --> 00:04:43,202
-Was it something important? - It was about Karin.

30
00:04:43,369 --> 00:04:45,829
I just had to write to you.

31
00:04:45,996 --> 00:04:48,999
Even if it would interrupt your work.

32
00:05:00,803 --> 00:05:03,764
- A cuckoo. Did you hear it? - No.

33
00:05:04,723 --> 00:05:07,685
-Now you have to hear him! -Where?

34
00:05:08,644 --> 00:05:12,690
- You need to wash your ears! - You hear too much!

35
00:05:12,857 --> 00:05:16,527
The illness has made my hearing worse.

36
00:05:16,694 --> 00:05:19,613
Maybe it was the electroshock therapy.

37
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:25,786
Didn't Dad look grey when he arrived from Switzerland yesterday?

38
00:05:25,953 --> 00:05:30,374
He was tired from the journey. But he didn't look happy.

39
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:34,795
- Is Marianne coming too? - Martin said that's over.

40
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:39,049
-Poor Dad, alone again. -I never liked Marianne.

41
00:05:39,175 --> 00:05:43,512
She always acted so arrogantly. Compared to that, Dad seemed so poor.

42
00:05:43,679 --> 00:05:49,226
- She badmouthed his books. - He needs to get good reviews.

43
00:05:49,393 --> 00:05:54,064
-But everyone reads his books! - He doesn't care about sales figures.

44
00:05:54,231 --> 00:05:56,901
He wants to be a poet.

45
00:05:59,111 --> 00:06:01,655
Why are you laughing like that?

46
00:06:01,822 --> 00:06:06,869
You're so big and serious! ''He wants to be a poet.''

47
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:12,958
Don't look so offended. I love you, little Minus!

48
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:17,922
- You're so big! - Don't be so silly!

49
00:06:18,088 --> 00:06:21,592
17 years old, and almost three meters tall!

50
00:06:22,384 --> 00:06:25,804
-Where's your girlfriend? - Nobody wants me!

51
00:06:25,971 --> 00:06:29,683
Don't be mad that I laughed at you.

52
00:06:48,118 --> 00:06:50,788
Edgar is the only psychiatrist I trust.

53
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:54,792
- He was there from the beginning. - And?

54
00:06:56,418 --> 00:07:00,631
We talked for a long time when Karin last month...

55
00:07:00,756 --> 00:07:03,467
came from the hospital.

56
00:07:04,176 --> 00:07:07,012
He cannot promise lasting recovery.

57
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:10,808
And now?

58
00:07:10,975 --> 00:07:13,519
She seems to be doing unusually well.

59
00:07:13,686 --> 00:07:16,647
Her sleep is somewhat restless.

60
00:07:16,772 --> 00:07:20,568
Heightened hearing. That's all.

61
00:07:21,944 --> 00:07:26,156
-How much does she know? - She knows about her illness.

62
00:07:26,323 --> 00:07:28,993
Except that it is almost incurable.

63
00:07:29,243 --> 00:07:30,536
fast?

64
00:07:32,288 --> 00:07:36,458
Edgar had patients who became completely healthy, so there is hope.

65
00:07:39,503 --> 00:07:43,007
-How are things going with you two? - Good, thanks.

66
00:07:43,174 --> 00:07:45,926
Everyday life goes on as usual.

67
00:07:46,051 --> 00:07:51,515
I give lectures and examine masses of students.

68
00:07:55,853 --> 00:08:00,858
I love Karin, and I am hopelessly attached to her.

69
00:08:00,983 --> 00:08:03,027
No matter what happens...

70
00:08:03,194 --> 00:08:07,364
I have become the anchor of her life.

71
00:08:07,489 --> 00:08:10,159
Perhaps your only security.

72
00:08:11,785 --> 00:08:13,370
I understand.

73
00:08:16,582 --> 00:08:20,127
-Shall we go back to the nets? - Good.

74
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:49,406
Minus...

75
00:08:49,573 --> 00:08:51,825
Dear...

76
00:08:51,992 --> 00:08:55,788
Beware of me! Stay away from me!

77
00:08:55,955 --> 00:08:58,332
Stop hugging and kissing me.

78
00:08:58,582 --> 00:09:01,585
Don't sunbathe half-naked, you disgust me!

79
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:05,589
You know exactly what I mean! Women are horrible!

80
00:09:05,756 --> 00:09:10,803
They smell and move, comb their hair and talk!

81
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:13,514
I feel like a skinned rabbit!

82
00:09:13,764 --> 00:09:16,433
You arm Kleiner.

83
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:20,020
Pity! I can feel sorry for myself!

84
00:09:20,145 --> 00:09:24,567
What's wrong, my darling? I've never seen you like this before.

85
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:29,446
Please don't tell Martin or Dad.

86
00:09:30,489 --> 00:09:32,449
Don't be silly!

87
00:09:33,576 --> 00:09:37,204
If only I could talk to Dad just once!

88
00:09:37,329 --> 00:09:40,124
But he's so busy with himself.

89
00:09:41,292 --> 00:09:43,335
He too.

90
00:09:44,003 --> 00:09:46,547
Come on, let's go back.

91
00:09:47,882 --> 00:09:50,968
- And I spilled the milk. - You careless brat!

92
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,060
Damn! I hate hurting my fingers!

93
00:10:00,352 --> 00:10:01,896
Put a bandage on it.

94
00:10:02,062 --> 00:10:05,399
- Hello! - Martin cut himself.

95
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:13,073
- Put a band-aid on it. - What a fuss.

96
00:10:13,282 --> 00:10:17,620
How lovely: dinner by lantern light and moonlight!

97
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,419
- You're a master chef, Dad! - That smells wonderful.

98
00:10:25,544 --> 00:10:28,088
Smell it, Minus...

99
00:10:29,215 --> 00:10:34,011
You should write cookbooks instead of novels!

100
00:10:34,136 --> 00:10:38,224
So, how do we sit... Karin there, and you there.

101
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:41,352
Minus there and me here.

102
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:47,191
How I longed for this moment! I was so homesick.

103
00:10:47,316 --> 00:10:50,194
- After us? -Yes, even after you!

104
00:10:52,988 --> 00:10:55,783
-Are you staying? -At least this month.

105
00:10:55,950 --> 00:11:01,372
- You're leaving again? - To Yugoslavia, as leader.

106
00:11:01,539 --> 00:11:05,292
-Why? - It was an attractive offer.

107
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:10,381
From a cultural delegation. And since I know the country...

108
00:11:12,508 --> 00:11:16,846
-So, David. Welcome home! - Thanks.

109
00:11:17,972 --> 00:11:20,808
Cheers to your health, Karin. And to yours, Minus!

110
00:11:26,355 --> 00:11:31,026
- And what about the book? - I'll finish that first.

111
00:11:31,193 --> 00:11:34,905
I'll submit the manuscript next week.

112
00:11:35,072 --> 00:11:38,826
- Are you going away long? - I don't know yet.

113
00:11:38,993 --> 00:11:43,289
Maybe I'll stay in Dubrovnik a bit longer after that.

114
00:11:51,755 --> 00:11:54,842
Now I feel like a criminal.

115
00:11:56,343 --> 00:11:59,680
You promised to stay home after Switzerland.

116
00:12:00,681 --> 00:12:03,976
I can't remember that.

117
00:12:04,143 --> 00:12:06,729
Yes, Dad, you promised.

118
00:12:09,648 --> 00:12:12,693
-How unfortunate. -Yes, how unfortunate.

119
00:12:22,203 --> 00:12:26,207
Listen... We wanted to have a nice evening...

120
00:12:26,373 --> 00:12:30,461
and now we are close to tears!

121
00:12:30,586 --> 00:12:34,215
I brought you gifts from Switzerland!

122
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,260
Cooking.

123
00:12:38,427 --> 00:12:40,471
And Martin.

124
00:12:40,596 --> 00:12:43,974
- Thanks, but that wasn't... - Minus.

125
00:12:44,141 --> 00:12:47,228
- Can we open it right away? - Go ahead!

126
00:12:52,191 --> 00:12:55,110
Excuse me, I'll quickly get my tobacco.

127
00:12:59,949 --> 00:13:04,078
- They don't fit over the thumb. - I already have one.

128
00:13:04,203 --> 00:13:09,959
- They're probably from Stockholm. - Still a nice gesture.

129
00:14:15,316 --> 00:14:20,821
-Thank you, David! - Thanks for the lovely gloves!

130
00:14:20,946 --> 00:14:24,241
We also have a surprise for you!

131
00:14:24,408 --> 00:14:27,161
-We'll blindfold you. - Don't look!

132
00:14:27,328 --> 00:14:32,082
- I'll do it, you go first! - I can't see anything at all!

133
00:14:36,962 --> 00:14:41,425
I feel like I'm walking on air. Who thought that up?

134
00:14:41,592 --> 00:14:43,677
Me and Karin.

135
00:14:52,186 --> 00:14:54,480
Just wait...

136
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:58,108
It's almost like Shakespeare.

137
00:15:03,197 --> 00:15:05,157
complete?

138
00:15:12,456 --> 00:15:17,044
Our play is called "The Artistic Ghost."

139
00:15:17,211 --> 00:15:20,005
Or ''Tomb of Illusions''.

140
00:15:20,631 --> 00:15:22,383
And here we go!

141
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:26,011
It is midnight in the Chapel of St. Teresa.

142
00:15:26,178 --> 00:15:29,640
This is where we will meet, my fiancée and I.

143
00:15:29,765 --> 00:15:34,520
Here, by this gravestone, where the scent of death hangs.

144
00:15:34,687 --> 00:15:38,274
Someone moved inside! Could it be her?

145
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,318
I will hide so as not to frighten them.

146
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:48,826
-Who are you? -I am the Castilian princess.

147
00:15:48,951 --> 00:15:51,954
She died in childbirth, at the age of 13.

148
00:15:52,121 --> 00:15:56,041
And my master, with whom I played as a child...

149
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:58,586
now finds comfort in other women.

150
00:15:58,711 --> 00:16:01,088
Princess, I love you!

151
00:16:01,255 --> 00:16:06,719
But who are you? I can't talk to everyone, even if I'm dead.

152
00:16:06,886 --> 00:16:09,054
Do not be afraid!

153
00:16:09,221 --> 00:16:13,767
I am the master of my own kingdom. It is quite small and very poor.

154
00:16:13,934 --> 00:16:16,854
- I am an artist! - Artist?

155
00:16:17,021 --> 00:16:20,399
Yes, Princess! An artist of the purest kind.

156
00:16:20,566 --> 00:16:24,320
A poet without poems, a painter without paintings...

157
00:16:26,864 --> 00:16:29,617
- Musician. - A musician without sounds.

158
00:16:29,742 --> 00:16:34,788
I despise finished works of art! Banal results of vulgar effort.

159
00:16:34,914 --> 00:16:38,584
My life is my work, and it is dedicated to my love for you!

160
00:16:38,751 --> 00:16:43,380
- Such beautiful, yet unbelievable words. - I beg you, test me!

161
00:16:44,048 --> 00:16:47,968
Listen carefully. I will be leaving you soon.

162
00:16:48,093 --> 00:16:52,473
When the clock strikes two, you shall enter the grave...

163
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,476
and blow out the three candles in it.

164
00:16:56,435 --> 00:16:58,812
Then the door closes...

165
00:16:59,063 --> 00:17:02,233
and you will join me in death.

166
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,401
An easy target, Princess.

167
00:17:04,652 --> 00:17:08,322
For what does life mean to the true artist?

168
00:17:14,787 --> 00:17:19,959
This is how you complete your work of art and crown your love.

169
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:21,794
This is how you elevate your life...

170
00:17:22,086 --> 00:17:26,048
and shows the skeptics the power of a true artist.

171
00:17:28,175 --> 00:17:30,344
Farewell, my friend.

172
00:17:30,511 --> 00:17:33,180
Doesn't disappoint me.

173
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:41,981
This is the moment of absolute perfection! I tremble with anticipation.

174
00:17:42,147 --> 00:17:44,942
I dive into oblivion.

175
00:17:45,067 --> 00:17:47,987
Only death will love me from now on.

176
00:17:49,321 --> 00:17:52,116
I go, and nothing can stop me.

177
00:17:52,867 --> 00:17:56,579
- I'm waiting. - You devil, what am I doing?

178
00:17:56,745 --> 00:17:59,165
Sacrifice my life, but for what?

179
00:17:59,331 --> 00:18:03,878
For eternity? For the perfect work of art? For love?

180
00:18:04,044 --> 00:18:07,047
- Have I gone mad? - I'm waiting!

181
00:18:07,214 --> 00:18:13,137
Who will see my sacrifice? Death! Who will measure my love? A ghost!

182
00:18:13,304 --> 00:18:17,558
-Who will thank me? Eternity! -I wait.

183
00:18:20,019 --> 00:18:24,356
My knees are made of clay, I tremble, my insides churn.

184
00:18:24,523 --> 00:18:28,944
- I can't go into eternity like this... - I'm not waiting any longer.

185
00:18:32,823 --> 00:18:35,534
Well, that's life.

186
00:18:36,952 --> 00:18:40,289
Of course I could write a poem about the princess.

187
00:18:40,456 --> 00:18:43,501
Paint a picture or compose an opera...

188
00:18:43,626 --> 00:18:47,004
although this would of course have a more heroic ending.

189
00:18:48,464 --> 00:18:51,425
I enter the realm of oblivion.

190
00:18:52,343 --> 00:18:55,763
Now only death shall love me.

191
00:18:57,348 --> 00:18:58,974
Not bad.

192
00:19:00,476 --> 00:19:03,854
The young roosters announce the dawn!

193
00:19:06,232 --> 00:19:08,609
I'm going to go home and go to bed.

194
00:19:12,613 --> 00:19:17,284
- And that's it. - The author! The author!

195
00:19:18,702 --> 00:19:21,372
You were fantastic!

196
00:19:21,497 --> 00:19:24,959
- And you, excellent. - That made everything negative!

197
00:19:25,084 --> 00:19:28,921
-But I forgot my lines. -Oh, never!

198
00:19:40,766 --> 00:19:44,019
Now cover and wash.

199
00:19:44,144 --> 00:19:48,315
- I'll do it, I'm not tired. - Out of the question!

200
00:19:48,482 --> 00:19:52,528
Yes, I like cleaning, you would do me a favor.

201
00:19:52,695 --> 00:19:56,073
- Well, if that's the case... - So, it's a deal.

202
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,909
I'll start right away.

203
00:19:59,076 --> 00:20:01,662
-Are you going to bed now? -Yes.

204
00:20:01,829 --> 00:20:05,666
- There's hot water in the kitchen. - Oh, good.

205
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:09,378
- The storm has passed. - I told you.

206
00:20:09,545 --> 00:20:14,633
We had the windows open, now we have mosquitoes in the bedroom.

207
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:18,512
- Good night, Dad. - Good night, Karin.

208
00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:21,348
Good night everyone!

209
00:20:21,807 --> 00:20:24,685
-Is it okay? -Yes.

210
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:27,521
- I'll help you. - It's okay.

211
00:21:16,487 --> 00:21:19,156
Can you please help me?

212
00:21:26,121 --> 00:21:29,416
Such black fingers, that's from gardening.

213
00:21:29,542 --> 00:21:31,585
It doesn't go away either.

214
00:21:33,212 --> 00:21:36,423
You have such kind fingers.

215
00:21:37,383 --> 00:21:40,261
But your thumb looks a little stubborn.

216
00:21:41,804 --> 00:21:45,349
- Are you sad, Karin? - Not really.

217
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,269
What are you thinking about?

218
00:21:48,435 --> 00:21:51,355
Sometimes we are so defenseless.

219
00:21:52,147 --> 00:21:54,942
No, I don't know...

220
00:21:56,151 --> 00:22:00,447
Like children abandoned in the wilderness at night.

221
00:22:00,614 --> 00:22:05,035
The owls fly by, watching you with their yellow eyes.

222
00:22:05,202 --> 00:22:09,582
You can hear the clattering and rustling, the coughing and sighing...

223
00:22:09,748 --> 00:22:12,960
All those wet snouts...

224
00:22:13,711 --> 00:22:16,088
The teeth of wolves...

225
00:22:16,255 --> 00:22:19,258
Don't worry, we have each other.

226
00:22:19,884 --> 00:22:24,805
- You look nervous... - I'm not nervous at all.

227
00:22:24,972 --> 00:22:30,978
You say there are no wolves, I don't see any owls and I don't hear anything.

228
00:22:31,145 --> 00:22:33,898
"You're just imagining it."

229
00:22:34,064 --> 00:22:37,902
You have to trust me, Karin. Little Kajsa.

230
00:22:38,694 --> 00:22:40,821
"Little Kajta",,,

231
00:22:40,988 --> 00:22:44,325
That's what you always say. "Little Kajsa."

232
00:22:45,784 --> 00:22:49,788
Am I so small, or has the illness turned me into a child?

233
00:22:49,955 --> 00:22:52,833
Do you find me strange?

234
00:22:56,378 --> 00:22:59,840
- Do you think I'm telling the truth? - I don't know.

235
00:23:03,052 --> 00:23:06,430
- Do you think I love you? - Yes.

236
00:23:06,597 --> 00:23:10,309
- Isn't that enough? - Of course that's enough.

237
00:23:10,476 --> 00:23:14,396
- Stop, or it'll bleed! - It's okay.

238
00:23:20,236 --> 00:23:23,572
Tomorrow I have to do laundry.

239
00:23:23,739 --> 00:23:25,533
Come to bed, Karin.

240
00:23:25,699 --> 00:23:29,703
Papa took Minus' piece as a personal insult.

241
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:33,791
It hurt him deeply, but he didn't let it show.

242
00:23:33,958 --> 00:23:37,169
And Minus was, of course, upset too.

243
00:23:46,887 --> 00:23:49,640
Shall we turn off the light?

244
00:23:52,852 --> 00:23:56,814
- I don't want to make you sad. - My dear child...

245
00:23:56,981 --> 00:24:00,568
- I'm sorry. - My dearest...

246
00:24:02,236 --> 00:24:04,697
My dear, dear girl.

247
00:24:05,614 --> 00:24:08,075
Lamb, I love you.

248
00:24:10,077 --> 00:24:12,830
You could never hurt me.

249
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,958
You are so sweet and I am so mean.

250
00:24:18,961 --> 00:24:20,838
Good night.

251
00:25:57,309 --> 00:26:02,189
''Panting with anticipation, she came toward him...

252
00:26:02,356 --> 00:26:05,234
cheeks flushed by the strong wind.''

253
00:26:07,778 --> 00:26:09,613
My God!

254
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:43,322
''They met...

255
00:31:44,198 --> 00:31:47,201
am Strand.''

256
00:31:56,335 --> 00:32:00,965
Hello, little Kajsa. Up already? It's not even four o'clock yet!

257
00:32:01,841 --> 00:32:04,301
-Hello, Dad. -What's going on?

258
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:09,056
Do you have something on your mind?

259
00:32:09,181 --> 00:32:13,978
I'm putting the finishing touches to the book, not exactly my favorite hobby.

260
00:32:14,103 --> 00:32:17,398
- Read something to me. - Later, when I have the proofs.

261
00:32:18,983 --> 00:32:23,904
"Why aren't you sleeping?" - The birds screamed eerily.

262
00:32:24,071 --> 00:32:28,159
Then I woke up, and then I didn't dare go back to sleep.

263
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:32,246
Then come.

264
00:32:45,634 --> 00:32:50,306
-Like when I was little. -Now you'll be asleep soon.

265
00:33:10,493 --> 00:33:13,496
''They met on the beach.

266
00:33:13,662 --> 00:33:16,332
It was a clear day.

267
00:33:16,457 --> 00:33:19,126
Autumn was in the air.''

268
00:33:20,252 --> 00:33:23,547
- Dad! - Shh! Karin just fell asleep.

269
00:33:25,424 --> 00:33:29,803
- Come on, let's pull in the nets. - I'm coming.

270
00:33:58,457 --> 00:34:01,669
Last year I could walk on my hands as well as on my feet.

271
00:34:01,794 --> 00:34:05,840
-Now I'm so big and unstable. - I feel the same way.

272
00:34:06,006 --> 00:34:08,050
Do you mean spiritual?

273
00:34:08,217 --> 00:34:10,678
- Are you writing at the moment? - Plays.

274
00:34:10,845 --> 00:34:13,013
- Can I read something? - No.

275
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:16,684
No offense, but they're not very good.

276
00:34:16,851 --> 00:34:21,939
- Have you written a lot? - 13 plays and 1 opera this summer.

277
00:34:22,106 --> 00:34:25,734
It just flows out of me. Is it the same for you?

278
00:34:25,901 --> 00:34:27,695
No.

279
00:34:27,862 --> 00:34:30,948
What did you think of our play last night?

280
00:34:31,115 --> 00:34:34,285
- Nice. - I thought it was shit.

281
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:27,773
''Your illness is incurable...

282
00:36:29,191 --> 00:36:32,027
with temporary improvements.

283
00:36:33,612 --> 00:36:39,201
I've suspected it for a long time, but it's still unbearable.

284
00:36:41,829 --> 00:36:45,666
My curiosity fills me with terror.

285
00:36:47,751 --> 00:36:51,005
My urge to record the progression of the disease.

286
00:36:51,964 --> 00:36:57,094
To accurately describe their gradual decay.

287
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:01,849
To use them.''

288
00:37:46,227 --> 00:37:49,897
Wake up! How much longer do you want to sleep?

289
00:37:50,064 --> 00:37:53,067
Martin, time for a bath! Get up!

290
00:37:53,234 --> 00:37:56,695
-What time is it? - Almost ten.

291
00:37:56,862 --> 00:37:59,824
My goodness, I slept that long?

292
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:07,289
- You rascal! It's only five. - So what?

293
00:38:07,456 --> 00:38:12,670
I've been up for a long time and have experienced strange things.

294
00:38:12,837 --> 00:38:17,007
- Come here. - No, get up! We're going swimming.

295
00:38:17,174 --> 00:38:20,678
- Dad and Minus are bringing in the nets. - Come here!

296
00:38:25,182 --> 00:38:30,312
You sleep too much, that's why you're always so know-it-all.

297
00:38:37,444 --> 00:38:40,239
My little one, what's wrong with you?

298
00:38:43,117 --> 00:38:45,411
Nothing...

299
00:38:45,578 --> 00:38:49,165
-What is it, Karin? - I have something to confess to you.

300
00:38:49,331 --> 00:38:51,876
Then speak up.

301
00:38:53,252 --> 00:38:55,838
When Dad went out earlier...

302
00:38:56,005 --> 00:38:59,300
I rummaged around in his desk.

303
00:38:59,466 --> 00:39:03,012
I don't know why, I just had this urge.

304
00:39:03,179 --> 00:39:04,722
And?

305
00:39:06,557 --> 00:39:09,768
- I found his diary there. - And?

306
00:39:12,605 --> 00:39:15,733
- There were things in there... -What kind of things?

307
00:39:17,026 --> 00:39:19,737
About me.

308
00:39:19,862 --> 00:39:23,949
-What did he write? - I can't tell you.

309
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:27,453
Something about your illness?

310
00:39:29,872 --> 00:39:33,876
- Is it really incurable? - Dearest Karin...

311
00:39:34,043 --> 00:39:37,004
Now listen to me!

312
00:39:37,171 --> 00:39:39,882
Listen... Look at me!

313
00:39:40,007 --> 00:39:42,301
Look at me.

314
00:39:42,426 --> 00:39:46,639
I told David that you might have a relapse.

315
00:39:46,764 --> 00:39:49,308
Maybe he misunderstood that.

316
00:39:49,433 --> 00:39:53,103
No one can say that your illness is incurable.

317
00:39:54,605 --> 00:39:57,483
- Word of honor? - Word of honor.

318
00:39:59,568 --> 00:40:01,570
So.

319
00:40:02,404 --> 00:40:04,532
There was more in there.

320
00:40:04,698 --> 00:40:07,660
-Yes? -But I can't tell you that.

321
00:40:07,785 --> 00:40:11,622
- Please... - Impossible!

322
00:40:11,789 --> 00:40:14,250
ask him yourself!

323
00:40:16,669 --> 00:40:19,672
Karin... Little Karin...

324
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:21,841
Martin?

325
00:40:24,635 --> 00:40:27,555
You still have to be patient with me.

326
00:40:28,889 --> 00:40:32,017
My cravings will surely return soon.

327
00:40:32,142 --> 00:40:34,353
- Don't you think so? -Of course!

328
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:38,107
- Are you worried about that? - Not at all.

329
00:40:39,358 --> 00:40:42,611
Listen, I'm terribly tired, but...

330
00:40:43,362 --> 00:40:46,949
I think we should go swimming anyway.

331
00:40:47,116 --> 00:40:49,493
It's not cold at all.

332
00:40:59,128 --> 00:41:01,755
Imagine you had a quiet wife...

333
00:41:02,006 --> 00:41:04,466
who gives you children and brings you coffee.

334
00:41:04,633 --> 00:41:08,137
A soft, warm, beautiful woman...

335
00:41:08,971 --> 00:41:11,932
Wouldn't that be nice?

336
00:41:12,099 --> 00:41:15,561
-But I love you. -Yes, of course, but still.

337
00:41:15,728 --> 00:41:18,814
I don't want anyone else!

338
00:41:25,905 --> 00:41:31,577
You always say and do everything right, and yet things still go wrong.

339
00:41:34,163 --> 00:41:36,290
I do it out of love.

340
00:41:36,457 --> 00:41:40,044
Those who truly love never hurt others.

341
00:41:40,211 --> 00:41:43,172
In that case, you don't love me.

342
00:41:52,681 --> 00:41:54,225
Bye, Minus!

343
00:41:55,017 --> 00:41:56,769
Bye!

344
00:42:13,035 --> 00:42:16,872
Please make sure Minus doesn't fall asleep while learning Latin.

345
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:21,293
-I wanted to learn grammar with him. -Goodbye, my girl.

346
00:42:22,628 --> 00:42:26,423
Don't forget your cognac and bring a white wine.

347
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:29,093
- Bye, darling. - See you tonight.

348
00:43:10,426 --> 00:43:13,304
Why are you laughing so stupidly?

349
00:43:15,472 --> 00:43:17,141
Hm?

350
00:43:19,101 --> 00:43:21,562
Say something!

351
00:43:23,147 --> 00:43:26,150
There, if you find it so funny!

352
00:43:26,275 --> 00:43:28,736
Which one do you like best?

353
00:43:28,903 --> 00:43:32,948
Don't be a spoilsport, come here and show me!

354
00:43:37,995 --> 00:43:41,957
- That one? Why? - It's so soft.

355
00:43:42,124 --> 00:43:45,878
I think she's pretty, too. But a bit fat, right?

356
00:43:46,045 --> 00:43:50,549
- And such long hair... - She looks pretty uncomplicated.

357
00:43:52,635 --> 00:43:55,804
But what good is that to me?

358
00:44:02,186 --> 00:44:04,939
Do you want to hit me?

359
00:44:09,527 --> 00:44:12,571
That was my fault. Forgive me.

360
00:44:12,696 --> 00:44:17,535
Calm down, Minus. It's okay, don't worry.

361
00:44:18,869 --> 00:44:22,164
I shouldn't have snooped around.

362
00:44:23,582 --> 00:44:26,836
I don't even want it to happen, it just happens.

363
00:44:32,675 --> 00:44:37,263
-Should I quiz you? -If you feel like it.

364
00:44:40,641 --> 00:44:43,602
- I wonder if everyone's locked up like this? -What?

365
00:44:43,769 --> 00:44:49,191
You in your cage, me in mine. All of us.

366
00:44:49,316 --> 00:44:54,071
- I don't feel locked in at all. - Then I'm wrong again.

367
00:44:54,238 --> 00:44:57,449
Constructio adsensum, what does that mean?

368
00:44:57,616 --> 00:44:58,951
Stop it.

369
00:44:59,076 --> 00:45:04,456
This means adapting a grammatical construction to the content.

370
00:45:05,666 --> 00:45:07,585
For example?

371
00:45:07,751 --> 00:45:11,881
The nobility abandoned the republic,,,

372
00:45:12,047 --> 00:45:14,925
they had deserted,

373
00:45:15,092 --> 00:45:18,637
- Isn't that hot! - And I've been up since half past four.

374
00:45:18,804 --> 00:45:21,640
Do you want to smoke one?

375
00:45:29,732 --> 00:45:35,196
If you look at it with your head tilted for a long time, it becomes creepy.

376
00:45:35,362 --> 00:45:37,531
Creepy?

377
00:45:38,574 --> 00:45:40,910
But also tempting.

378
00:45:41,076 --> 00:45:45,873
I don't talk to Dad or Martin about it, they don't understand.

379
00:45:45,998 --> 00:45:51,462
Especially Martin, he's already nervous and has enough worries.

380
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:57,426
They don't understand, they just think I'm sick.

381
00:45:57,593 --> 00:46:00,304
- Do you think so too? - No!

382
00:46:02,431 --> 00:46:04,767
I thought so.

383
00:46:08,979 --> 00:46:11,524
You are stronger.

384
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:15,027
I've wanted to talk to you about all of this so often.

385
00:46:15,194 --> 00:46:17,696
You can trust me.

386
00:46:18,531 --> 00:46:22,868
It's hard to hide something you're constantly thinking about.

387
00:46:23,035 --> 00:46:25,955
But I think they won't mind if I tell you.

388
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:31,210
- ''You''? - Don't pester me with questions.

389
00:46:31,335 --> 00:46:33,963
Enmeder I tell you or not.

390
00:46:34,088 --> 00:46:37,633
- I'm just curious. - You don't mind.

391
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,809
I want to show you something.

392
00:47:29,810 --> 00:47:32,271
Because I can walk through walls.

393
00:47:32,438 --> 00:47:37,651
Every morning I wake up because someone is calling my name.

394
00:47:38,903 --> 00:47:42,031
Then I get up and go into this room.

395
00:47:42,198 --> 00:47:46,952
One day someone called out to me from behind the wallpaper.

396
00:47:49,413 --> 00:47:53,459
I looked in the closet, but no one was there.

397
00:47:55,544 --> 00:47:59,089
But the voice continued to call my name...

398
00:47:59,256 --> 00:48:03,969
So I pressed myself against the wall, and it gave way like leaves.

399
00:48:04,094 --> 00:48:06,555
And then I went in.

400
00:48:10,351 --> 00:48:13,187
You think I'm just making this up, right?

401
00:48:18,567 --> 00:48:21,320
I enter a large room.

402
00:48:22,822 --> 00:48:25,574
It is bright and friendly there.

403
00:48:27,159 --> 00:48:30,746
People walk up and down.

404
00:48:30,871 --> 00:48:34,458
Some explain it to me so that I understand.

405
00:48:36,585 --> 00:48:39,630
It's so beautiful there, and I'm safe.

406
00:48:41,048 --> 00:48:44,844
A light shines on some faces.

407
00:48:47,263 --> 00:48:50,266
Everyone is waiting for him...

408
00:48:50,432 --> 00:48:52,977
but no one is nervous.

409
00:48:54,061 --> 00:48:58,190
They say I can be there too when it happens!

410
00:49:00,276 --> 00:49:02,444
Why are you crying?

411
00:49:03,904 --> 00:49:06,198
It's already good.

412
00:49:06,699 --> 00:49:09,160
No fear.

413
00:49:12,788 --> 00:49:17,293
But... sometimes I feel such terrible longing.

414
00:49:19,503 --> 00:49:22,548
I long for the moment...

415
00:49:23,591 --> 00:49:26,760
when the door opens...

416
00:49:26,927 --> 00:49:32,057
- and everyone turns to him. -To whom? Who is he?

417
00:49:37,938 --> 00:49:40,649
Nobody said exactly.

418
00:49:42,985 --> 00:49:47,114
But I believe it is God who will reveal himself to us.

419
00:49:49,617 --> 00:49:55,080
That he will come through the door and enter the room.

420
00:50:04,882 --> 00:50:07,092
Minus...

421
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:12,556
It's not easy for me to say this...

422
00:50:12,723 --> 00:50:15,851
-What? - I turn away from Martin.

423
00:50:15,976 --> 00:50:19,522
He calls for me, but I can't help him.

424
00:50:19,688 --> 00:50:22,274
I'm playing something for him.

425
00:50:22,441 --> 00:50:26,111
- Does he notice anything? - I'm not sure.

426
00:50:26,278 --> 00:50:29,323
I have to choose between him and the others.

427
00:50:29,490 --> 00:50:33,786
I've made my decision. I've sacrificed Martin.

428
00:50:35,246 --> 00:50:38,374
- Is this all real? - I don't know.

429
00:50:38,499 --> 00:50:43,254
I feel torn, and sometimes I'm not sure.

430
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:47,299
I know that I was sick and that the illness was like a dream.

431
00:50:47,466 --> 00:50:52,638
But these aren't dreams, this is real. It must be real!

432
00:50:52,805 --> 00:50:56,767
For me they are not real, not at all.

433
00:50:58,435 --> 00:51:00,479
Cooking,,,

434
00:51:00,646 --> 00:51:03,482
- For me, it's not real. -But yes!

435
00:51:09,196 --> 00:51:12,324
A god comes down from the mountain.

436
00:51:13,617 --> 00:51:17,329
He walks through the dark forest...

437
00:51:17,496 --> 00:51:22,084
Wild animals everywhere, in the silence and the darkness.

438
00:51:25,045 --> 00:51:27,506
This has to be real.

439
00:51:28,090 --> 00:51:31,760
I am not dreaming, and I am telling the truth.

440
00:51:31,927 --> 00:51:35,764
One moment I am in one world, the next in another.

441
00:51:35,890 --> 00:51:38,601
I can't stop it!

442
00:51:49,278 --> 00:51:51,864
Shall we go swimming?

443
00:51:54,492 --> 00:51:57,244
Otherwise I'll go alone.

444
00:51:58,496 --> 00:52:01,207
I am tired.

445
00:52:01,373 --> 00:52:04,460
I'm going to lie down for a bit.

446
00:52:04,585 --> 00:52:07,254
Close the door when you leave.

447
00:52:16,639 --> 00:52:19,642
Don't do that! Get out! Get out!

448
00:52:34,365 --> 00:52:37,243
What should I do?

449
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:52,508
Well, have you practiced Latin?

450
00:52:53,884 --> 00:52:56,595
Come on, let's continue.

451
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:59,765
But first let's have some tea.

452
00:53:02,017 --> 00:53:03,644
Minus!

453
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:09,441
- Will you tell Dad and Martin? -What should I tell them?

454
00:53:09,608 --> 00:53:14,947
Clever, but you're not fooling me. Martin, you would say:

455
00:53:15,072 --> 00:53:19,201
"I need to talk to you about Karin." And then you tell him everything.

456
00:53:19,368 --> 00:53:22,621
-Can't you tell him? -Promise you won't say anything!

457
00:53:22,788 --> 00:53:26,417
-Promise. -No one understands this but you.

458
00:53:26,584 --> 00:53:31,380
-One word, and you've betrayed me. -Promise.

459
00:53:44,185 --> 00:53:47,229
- It looks like rain. - Do you think so?

460
00:53:47,354 --> 00:53:50,024
-What's wrong with you? -What?

461
00:53:50,149 --> 00:53:52,902
You are so quiet, almost hostile.

462
00:53:53,027 --> 00:53:56,947
- Let's not talk about it. - Yes, please!

463
00:53:57,114 --> 00:53:59,783
It's because of Karin.

464
00:54:00,701 --> 00:54:04,914
She found your diary in your desk.

465
00:54:05,039 --> 00:54:08,417
- And read it, of course. - Oh no...

466
00:54:12,379 --> 00:54:14,840
What did it say?

467
00:54:15,883 --> 00:54:18,552
Karin wanted me to ask you.

468
00:54:21,972 --> 00:54:25,267
That her illness is incurable.

469
00:54:26,268 --> 00:54:30,064
And that I have the urge to record its course.

470
00:54:31,732 --> 00:54:36,320
I can't deny my guilt. There are no excuses.

471
00:54:37,321 --> 00:54:40,699
It's always about you and yours.

472
00:54:43,035 --> 00:54:46,121
Your heartlessness is perverse.

473
00:54:46,288 --> 00:54:49,792
''Capture the flow.'' That's so typical!

474
00:54:52,294 --> 00:54:56,757
- You don't understand. - No, I don't.

475
00:54:56,924 --> 00:55:01,053
But I understand one thing very well: you are looking for topics.

476
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:05,891
The mental illness of one's own daughter. What a brilliant idea!

477
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:10,229
- I love her, Martin. - You "love" her?

478
00:55:10,396 --> 00:55:15,401
There's no room for emotions in your emptiness. You have no decency.

479
00:55:15,568 --> 00:55:20,156
You can express yourself well and always have the right words at hand.

480
00:55:20,322 --> 00:55:26,078
But there is one thing you have absolutely no idea about: life!

481
00:55:26,203 --> 00:55:28,747
You are a coward!

482
00:55:28,914 --> 00:55:34,003
But there's one thing you can do like no other: make excuses and evasions.

483
00:55:35,963 --> 00:55:39,884
-What do you want from me? - Write your book!

484
00:55:40,050 --> 00:55:44,930
This might bring you what you want: an artistic breakthrough.

485
00:55:45,055 --> 00:55:48,684
Then you didn't sacrifice your daughter in vain. And...

486
00:55:48,809 --> 00:55:51,937
Tell me!

487
00:56:01,530 --> 00:56:04,783
In your novels you always flirt with a god.

488
00:56:04,909 --> 00:56:10,873
But your faith and your doubt are highly implausible.

489
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:14,793
What is most striking is your ingenuity.

490
00:56:14,919 --> 00:56:18,756
-Do you think I don't know that? -Why do you keep going?

491
00:56:18,923 --> 00:56:23,135
- Why don't you do something respectable? -For example?

492
00:56:23,302 --> 00:56:28,015
Have you written a true word in your life as a writer?

493
00:56:28,182 --> 00:56:30,726
- I don't know. - See?

494
00:56:30,851 --> 00:56:35,272
Your half-lies are so sophisticated that they look like the truth.

495
00:56:35,439 --> 00:56:38,442
- I'll try. - Maybe.

496
00:56:38,609 --> 00:56:41,403
But you never quite make it.

497
00:56:42,905 --> 00:56:44,907
l know.

498
00:56:46,867 --> 00:56:49,537
You are empty, but capable.

499
00:56:49,662 --> 00:56:54,333
And now you want to fill your emptiness with Karin's downfall.

500
00:56:54,458 --> 00:57:00,589
But how does God fit into this picture? This makes him even more inscrutable!

501
00:57:00,756 --> 00:57:05,803
Here's a question: Can you control your deepest thoughts?

502
00:57:05,970 --> 00:57:09,640
Luckily, I'm not very complicated.

503
00:57:09,807 --> 00:57:13,811
My world is very simple. Clear and human.

504
00:57:14,061 --> 00:57:17,356
But you already wished she would die.

505
00:57:17,481 --> 00:57:19,024
Absolutely not!

506
00:57:20,067 --> 00:57:22,444
Only you can think of something like that.

507
00:57:22,611 --> 00:57:27,449
Do you swear you've never thought of it? It would be logical...

508
00:57:27,616 --> 00:57:34,039
Your case is hopeless. And you know you're suffering in vain.

509
00:57:34,165 --> 00:57:37,459
- She could just as well be dead. - You're grotesque.

510
00:57:37,585 --> 00:57:40,921
That's a matter of opinion.

511
00:57:42,715 --> 00:57:45,384
l love her.

512
00:57:45,551 --> 00:57:47,761
I am powerless.

513
00:57:48,554 --> 00:57:51,473
I can only watch helplessly...

514
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:55,978
how she turns into a poor, tormented creature.

515
00:57:58,981 --> 00:58:01,775
I would like to tell you something.

516
00:58:04,695 --> 00:58:08,324
When I was in Switzerland, I decided to kill myself.

517
00:58:08,491 --> 00:58:11,660
I rented a car and looked for a precipice.

518
00:58:12,703 --> 00:58:18,250
I set off. It was afternoon, and it was already dark in the valley.

519
00:58:20,336 --> 00:58:24,423
I was empty. No fear, no regrets, no expectations.

520
00:58:25,299 --> 00:58:30,554
I drove toward the edge, accelerated, and suddenly the car stopped.

521
00:58:30,721 --> 00:58:33,432
The transmission was broken.

522
00:58:33,557 --> 00:58:38,938
The car skidded and stopped with the front tires over the edge.

523
00:58:39,104 --> 00:58:42,858
I crawled out trembling.

524
00:58:44,276 --> 00:58:47,947
Then I leaned against a rock wall on the other side of the street.

525
00:58:48,072 --> 00:58:51,283
I sat there for hours and yawned because I was so breathless.

526
00:58:53,828 --> 00:58:56,997
Why are you telling me this?

527
00:58:57,164 --> 00:59:01,460
To say that I no longer have a facade to protect.

528
00:59:01,627 --> 00:59:04,797
The truth does not cause catastrophe.

529
00:59:04,964 --> 00:59:08,592
- That has nothing to do with Karin. - I think it does.

530
00:59:09,844 --> 00:59:12,096
I do not understand that.

531
00:59:12,263 --> 00:59:17,393
From this emptiness came something I cannot touch or name.

532
00:59:20,479 --> 00:59:22,690
A love...

533
00:59:22,857 --> 00:59:25,276
for Karin... and Minus.

534
00:59:27,361 --> 00:59:29,321
And for you.

535
00:59:31,824 --> 00:59:34,743
Maybe I'll tell you about it sometime.

536
00:59:34,910 --> 00:59:37,997
I don't dare do it yet. But...

537
00:59:38,998 --> 00:59:42,751
If it is as I hope...

538
00:59:46,422 --> 00:59:48,591
Let's leave that aside for now.

539
01:00:08,652 --> 01:00:11,071
Now comes the rain.

540
01:00:13,032 --> 01:00:14,366
No.

541
01:00:17,328 --> 01:00:19,205
But...

542
01:00:20,289 --> 01:00:22,082
The rain is coming!

543
01:00:54,365 --> 01:00:56,325
Cook!

544
01:02:50,773 --> 01:02:53,442
Karin, are you there?

545
01:03:14,129 --> 01:03:16,966
It's me, Karin.

546
01:04:04,054 --> 01:04:07,349
Can't you hear me, Karin?!

547
01:04:07,516 --> 01:04:10,269
-I'm not feeling well. -We're going home.

548
01:04:10,394 --> 01:04:14,523
-You have to help me. -How?

549
01:04:16,192 --> 01:04:18,611
You have to help me.

550
01:04:23,991 --> 01:04:27,119
- I'm so thirsty. - I'll get you some water.

551
01:05:26,595 --> 01:05:28,472
Good.

552
01:07:34,431 --> 01:07:36,809
What time is it?

553
01:07:38,602 --> 01:07:40,980
five, I think.

554
01:07:42,148 --> 01:07:46,235
I was feeling very bad, but now I'm feeling better.

555
01:07:46,402 --> 01:07:49,738
-Poor Minus! - Karin, my darling...

556
01:07:49,864 --> 01:07:53,242
- I want to talk to Dad. Alone. - Let's go home.

557
01:07:53,409 --> 01:07:58,539
I need to talk to Dad before it starts again. Please!

558
01:08:07,923 --> 01:08:11,343
I go to the farm and call a rescue helicopter.

559
01:08:19,018 --> 01:08:24,190
Please get my medicine bag. I need to give her an injection.

560
01:08:33,157 --> 01:08:35,451
- Dad... - And?

561
01:08:35,576 --> 01:08:41,207
I want to stay in the hospital. I don't want to be treated anymore.

562
01:08:42,041 --> 01:08:44,543
Will I live if you tell them?

563
01:08:44,835 --> 01:08:46,754
I don't know.

564
01:08:47,087 --> 01:08:52,134
You can't live in two worlds. You have to choose.

565
01:08:52,301 --> 01:08:56,972
I can't keep switching from one to the other.

566
01:09:07,775 --> 01:09:09,819
It has to end.

567
01:09:10,778 --> 01:09:13,280
Was?

568
01:09:13,447 --> 01:09:16,450
- The hate. -What kind of hate?

569
01:09:23,666 --> 01:09:26,418
I didn't do it of my own free will.

570
01:09:27,837 --> 01:09:30,589
A voice commanded me.

571
01:09:33,175 --> 01:09:36,637
A voice commanded you to read my diary.

572
01:09:37,805 --> 01:09:41,559
And tell Martin what you read.

573
01:09:47,356 --> 01:09:50,234
It gets worse.

574
01:09:54,196 --> 01:09:56,448
Much worse.

575
01:10:01,537 --> 01:10:05,541
I tried to fight back, but I couldn't get away.

576
01:10:08,669 --> 01:10:10,963
I was forced to do it.

577
01:10:12,923 --> 01:10:15,634
When?

578
01:10:16,552 --> 01:10:18,804
Just now.

579
01:10:20,890 --> 01:10:22,892
Arms Minus!

580
01:10:27,605 --> 01:10:30,649
I just don't understand it!

581
01:10:31,192 --> 01:10:33,819
Try to stay calm, Karin.

582
01:10:38,157 --> 01:10:41,494
And this room with the waiting people...

583
01:10:44,872 --> 01:10:49,126
These good people who are waiting for the door to open...

584
01:10:49,293 --> 01:10:52,254
and God comes to them.

585
01:10:53,756 --> 01:10:56,592
But then the voices come...

586
01:10:57,510 --> 01:11:00,679
I have to do what the voices tell me.

587
01:11:02,306 --> 01:11:05,601
l don't understand it.

588
01:11:05,726 --> 01:11:08,437
Is it really just my illness?

589
01:11:09,647 --> 01:11:11,857
Papa...

590
01:11:12,024 --> 01:11:17,112
It is so terrible to see and understand one's own confusion!

591
01:11:33,003 --> 01:11:35,464
I would like to apologize to you.

592
01:11:37,716 --> 01:11:41,929
I avoided you because I had a guilty conscience.

593
01:11:44,723 --> 01:11:46,976
It makes me sick to think...

594
01:11:47,268 --> 01:11:50,396
how much life I have sacrificed for my ''art''.

595
01:11:50,563 --> 01:11:55,901
When your mother died, my success as a writer became more important to me.

596
01:11:56,026 --> 01:12:01,073
I was secretly happy, even though I loved her in my confused way.

597
01:12:01,198 --> 01:12:03,784
When I got sick, you went to Switzerland.

598
01:12:03,951 --> 01:12:08,164
Because I couldn't bear the fact that you inherited her illness.

599
01:12:08,330 --> 01:12:11,208
I had to finish writing my novel.

600
01:12:11,375 --> 01:12:13,836
Is it any good?

601
01:12:19,049 --> 01:12:21,427
It's like this, Karin...

602
01:12:22,428 --> 01:12:25,264
You draw a magic circle around yourself...

603
01:12:25,431 --> 01:12:30,811
to keep away anything that doesn't fit into his secret games.

604
01:12:30,978 --> 01:12:36,192
When life breaks the circle, the games become puny and silly.

605
01:12:37,735 --> 01:12:41,530
So you draw a new circle and build new protective walls.

606
01:12:45,576 --> 01:12:48,204
Poor little daddy.

607
01:12:48,329 --> 01:12:52,541
Poor little daddy who has to live in reality.

608
01:13:08,557 --> 01:13:11,018
Come on, let's go home.

609
01:13:11,185 --> 01:13:13,729
I have to pack.

610
01:13:27,368 --> 01:13:31,664
-When will the helicopter arrive? - About an hour.

611
01:13:32,790 --> 01:13:35,793
I just want to quickly change and pack.

612
01:13:42,633 --> 01:13:45,344
I'll manage.

613
01:13:51,058 --> 01:13:53,686
The light is so strong.

614
01:14:04,238 --> 01:14:07,283
You have to help Minus with his Latin, Dad.

615
01:14:10,077 --> 01:14:13,539
We still have to bring the keys to the house.

616
01:14:13,664 --> 01:14:18,169
- Aren't you coming back? - No, I'm staying here.

617
01:14:18,335 --> 01:14:20,796
That's the best, I think.

618
01:14:22,798 --> 01:14:25,843
Now we haven't collected any mushrooms at all.

619
01:14:27,678 --> 01:14:31,474
- Will you help me pack, Martin? - Of course.

620
01:14:33,517 --> 01:14:35,561
Minus!

621
01:14:36,479 --> 01:14:40,107
Minus, I want to talk to you!

622
01:14:41,567 --> 01:14:44,028
Come here, Minus!

623
01:14:59,001 --> 01:15:02,588
Your shirts are clean, but not ironed.

624
01:15:04,882 --> 01:15:10,262
- I still have some in town. - Will you help me close it?

625
01:15:20,898 --> 01:15:24,068
The shoes. I'll leave them here.

626
01:15:24,235 --> 01:15:27,530
Put them on and leave the ones you're wearing here.

627
01:15:27,655 --> 01:15:30,574
I'll take them to the shoemaker.

628
01:15:32,535 --> 01:15:35,204
Do you have a headache pill?

629
01:15:36,163 --> 01:15:40,459
- I thought my suitcase was here. - It's in the kitchen.

630
01:15:40,584 --> 01:15:42,795
True.

631
01:16:36,515 --> 01:16:40,394
- Have you seen Karin? - No.

632
01:17:15,387 --> 01:17:17,598
Yes I understand.

633
01:17:21,018 --> 01:17:23,312
I understand.

634
01:17:25,105 --> 01:17:27,900
Yes this is good.

635
01:17:29,527 --> 01:17:32,071
Yes I understand.

636
01:17:35,199 --> 01:17:37,701
Yes I understand.

637
01:17:37,868 --> 01:17:40,830
I know it won't be long now.

638
01:17:43,415 --> 01:17:46,126
That is a great consolation.

639
01:17:47,336 --> 01:17:50,506
But we waited with joy.

640
01:17:52,299 --> 01:17:56,929
Shh, Martin! They say he'll be here any minute.

641
01:17:57,096 --> 01:17:59,265
We must be ready.

642
01:17:59,431 --> 01:18:03,269
- Come on, let's go into town. - I can't go now.

643
01:18:03,394 --> 01:18:06,522
You're wrong, Karin.

644
01:18:08,107 --> 01:18:11,152
Nothing is happening here.

645
01:18:12,611 --> 01:18:16,657
Karin... No god will come through this door!

646
01:18:16,782 --> 01:18:21,328
He'll appear any minute, so I have to be here!

647
01:18:21,495 --> 01:18:24,540
Dearest Karin, that's not true!

648
01:18:24,707 --> 01:18:28,210
Better leave if you can't keep quiet.

649
01:18:28,377 --> 01:18:29,920
Come on now.

650
01:18:30,087 --> 01:18:34,466
Go on, give me this moment!

651
01:19:06,207 --> 01:19:09,168
Martin, darling...

652
01:19:09,335 --> 01:19:12,213
I'm sorry I was so mean just now.

653
01:19:13,714 --> 01:19:19,637
Will you kneel next to me and fold your hands?

654
01:19:19,804 --> 01:19:25,267
It looks so weird and demonstrative when you sit there on that chair.

655
01:19:25,392 --> 01:19:28,521
I know you don't believe it.

656
01:19:28,646 --> 01:19:31,315
But do it for my sake, Martin.

657
01:19:39,824 --> 01:19:41,700
Cooking,,,

658
01:19:41,867 --> 01:19:44,119
My love!

659
01:19:44,829 --> 01:19:47,957
My love... my love!

660
01:21:05,784 --> 01:21:08,204
Hold her legs tight.

661
01:21:27,681 --> 01:21:30,142
Calm down, Karin.

662
01:22:11,642 --> 01:22:14,103
I was scared.

663
01:22:16,689 --> 01:22:19,108
The door opened...

664
01:22:20,484 --> 01:22:23,320
but the god was a spider.

665
01:22:27,658 --> 01:22:30,536
He came towards me...

666
01:22:30,703 --> 01:22:33,080
and I saw his face.

667
01:22:34,123 --> 01:22:37,209
It was a terrible, stony face.

668
01:22:40,838 --> 01:22:44,216
He climbed up me and tried to penetrate me...

669
01:22:44,383 --> 01:22:46,844
but I resisted.

670
01:22:48,471 --> 01:22:51,348
And the whole time I saw his eyes.

671
01:22:52,516 --> 01:22:54,977
They were cold and quiet.

672
01:22:57,480 --> 01:23:00,608
When he couldn't penetrate me...

673
01:23:01,734 --> 01:23:04,653
he crawled further up my chest...

674
01:23:06,071 --> 01:23:09,283
Over my face and onto the wall.

675
01:23:18,792 --> 01:23:21,086
I have seen God.

676
01:23:42,691 --> 01:23:46,487
Wait at the jetty, we'll be there as soon as possible.

677
01:23:53,410 --> 01:23:55,996
They wait at the jetty.

678
01:27:07,188 --> 01:27:09,190
Papa...

679
01:27:11,817 --> 01:27:14,236
I'm scared, Dad!

680
01:27:15,696 --> 01:27:20,576
As I sat in the wreckage, holding Karin in my arms, reality crumbled.

681
01:27:20,743 --> 01:27:23,996
-Do you understand me? - I understand.

682
01:27:24,121 --> 01:27:27,917
Reality shattered and I fell out.

683
01:27:29,084 --> 01:27:31,253
It's like a dream...

684
01:27:31,378 --> 01:27:33,756
Anything can happen.

685
01:27:33,881 --> 01:27:35,841
Everything!

686
01:27:36,675 --> 01:27:38,511
l know.

687
01:27:38,761 --> 01:27:40,930
I cannot live in this new world.

688
01:27:41,055 --> 01:27:45,392
Yes. But you need something to hold on to.

689
01:27:45,559 --> 01:27:48,854
And what is that supposed to be? A god?

690
01:27:51,065 --> 01:27:53,567
Prove to me that he exists!

691
01:27:55,569 --> 01:27:57,738
- You can't. - Yes, you can.

692
01:27:57,905 --> 01:28:01,242
But you have to listen carefully.

693
01:28:01,408 --> 01:28:04,620
Yes. I have to listen.

694
01:28:04,787 --> 01:28:08,791
I can only give you a glimpse of my own hope.

695
01:28:08,958 --> 01:28:13,420
The knowledge that love exists in the human world.

696
01:28:13,587 --> 01:28:16,715
- A special kind of love? - All kinds, minus.

697
01:28:16,882 --> 01:28:21,637
The highest and the lowest, the silliest and the most sublime.

698
01:28:21,762 --> 01:28:23,722
All kinds of love.

699
01:28:23,848 --> 01:28:27,893
- The longing for love? - Longing and rejection.

700
01:28:28,060 --> 01:28:31,188
Doubt and faith.

701
01:28:31,355 --> 01:28:34,525
Then love is the proof?

702
01:28:36,110 --> 01:28:41,532
I don't know if love is the proof of God or if it is God,

703
01:28:42,741 --> 01:28:46,412
For you, love and God are one and the same?

704
01:28:47,496 --> 01:28:52,084
This thought helps me recover from my emptiness and hopelessness.

705
01:28:53,127 --> 01:28:55,588
Keep talking, Dad!

706
01:28:55,754 --> 01:28:58,632
Suddenly the emptiness turns into fullness...

707
01:28:58,799 --> 01:29:01,260
and hopelessness in life.

708
01:29:01,427 --> 01:29:04,763
It's like a pardon, minus...

709
01:29:04,930 --> 01:29:07,516
of a death sentence.

710
01:29:08,225 --> 01:29:11,270
Dad, if it's as you say...

711
01:29:11,437 --> 01:29:16,859
then Karin is surrounded by God because we love her.

712
01:29:17,026 --> 01:29:19,528
Could this help her?

713
01:29:21,780 --> 01:29:23,782
I think so.

714
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:27,953
Dad?

715
01:29:28,120 --> 01:29:32,833
- Can I go for a run? - Go ahead. I'm making dinner.

716
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,628
See you in an hour.

717
01:29:42,635 --> 01:29:45,471
Dad talked to me.
